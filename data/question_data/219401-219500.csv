0,Restricting a Weil divisor to a local scheme,Restricting a Weil divisor to a local scheme,,"Apologies if the title is garbage. I couldn't think up anything more pertinent, as it's really just a notational question. In Hartshorne, p.141, Proposition 6.11, it is shown that Weil divisors are Cartier (under some assumptions). My question is what on earth does it mean for $\mbox{Spec } \mathcal{O}_x$ to be a local scheme; moreover, how does one induce a Weil divisor $D_x$ on it? In my head this is supposed to be restricting $D$ to a given point; the construction then gives a local equation for $D$ at $x$. However, I am struggling to see how the scheme $\mbox{Spec } \mathcal{O}_x$ corresponds at all to $x$: it's not even a point unless the stalk is a field. Thanks for any help offered.","Apologies if the title is garbage. I couldn't think up anything more pertinent, as it's really just a notational question.

2,Comparing notions of degree of vector bundle,Comparing notions of degree of vector bundle,,"In this question, $X$ will be a smooth complex projective variety.  This question will be about comparing two different ways of calculating the degree of a vector bundle on such an $X$. I understand that, unless $X$ is a curve or $\mbox{Pic}(X)=\mathbb Z$, there is no well-defined notion of ""degree"" for vector bundles. I would like to use $X=\mathbb{P}^2$ as an example.  This is a variety with $\mbox{Pic}(X)=\mathbb Z$.  A vector bundle $V$ on $\mathbb{P}^2$ has a well-defined degree, which we define to be the image of $\det V$ under the natural identification of $\mbox{Pic}(X)$ with $\mathbb Z$.  For instance, if $V$ is the tangent bundle of $\mathbb{P}^2$, then $\det V=\mathcal O(3)$, and so $\deg V=3$. I have also seen the following way of defining the degree, for bundles on projective varieties: since $X$ is projective, there is a map $\kappa$ from $X$ into a projective space of the same or higher dimension.  Then we define a line bundle $\mathcal O_X(1)$ on $X$ by pulling back the $\mathcal O(1)$ from the projective space via $\kappa$.  Then, the degree of a bundle $V$ on $X$ is a number which I have seen denoted either $\deg(V):=c_1(\mathcal O_X(1))^{d-1}.c_1(V)$ or $\deg(V):=c_1(\mathcal O_X(1))^{d-1}\cap c_1(V)$, where $d=\dim(X)$. Question: In the case of $X=\mathbb P^2$, the map $\kappa$ is the identity, and we have $\deg(V)=c_1(\mathcal O(1))\cap c_1(V)$, where $\mathcal O(1)$ is just the hyperplane bundle of $\mathbb P^2$ itself. When $V$ is the tangent bundle, how do I see that the number $c_1(\mathcal O(1))\cap c_1(V)$ is equal to $3$?  My ""instinct"" is to think of $\mathcal O(1)$ as the line bundle of a divisor $D$, which in turn is determined by a hypersurface, specifically a projective line in $\mathbb P^2$, and then ask how many times that line is intersected by a ""generic"" section of $V$ (a vector field on $\mathbb P^2$, in this case, but I don't want this to depend too much on the fact that these sections are vector fields). Is this the right way to think? If it is, then two more questions: (1) How can I see in a fairly intuitive way that this intersection number is $3$? (2) Why would the intersection product of two Chern classes (elements of the cohomology ring $H^*(X,\mathbb Z)$) be equal to the intersection number of a divisor and a vector field (or of two divisors, more generally)?

10,Definition(s) of Stack,Definition(s) of Stack,,"I've started to learn about stacks, and a question arose in my attempts of looking at the very definition of a stack by several points of view.

I am interested in finding a way to solve this problem as it is presented in Vakil, and not in solving it using completly different methods (such as can be found in e.g. EGA II $5.5.5$, or Stacks Tag $01W7$, although under the additional assumptions that $Y$ is either quasi-separated or Noetherian).

The hint he gives is to show that in the case where $Z$ is affine, if $\mathcal{L}, \mathcal{M}$ are the very ample line bundles on $X,Y$ coming from pulling back the respective $\mathcal{O}(1)$ bundles from the projective bundles $X$ and $Y$ are closed subschemes of, then there is some $m$ such that $\mathcal{L}\otimes \pi^*(\mathcal{M})^{\otimes m}$ is $\rho\circ \pi-$very ample. He then suggests using that $Z$ is quasicompact to cover it by finitely many open affine pieces, but I can't work out how to use this to prove the result. My first instinct would be to glue together the morphisms constructed over each affine piece, or to extend the construction globally, but in this case neither approach works.

18,When exactly is a compact complex manifold algebraic?,When exactly is a compact complex manifold algebraic?,,"It is well known that a necessary and sufficient condition for a compact Kähler manifold $\mathcal{X}$ to be a projective algebraic variety is that it admit a positive holomorphic line bundle $L \rightarrow \mathcal{X}$ . The positivity of $L$ yields a proper holomorphic embedding in projective space and Chow's theorem tells us that the image is cut out by homogeneous polynomials. Here I regard the existence of a positive holomorphic line bundle (meaning a line bundle whose Chern connection has positive curvature) as a differential-geometric condition. Now suppose that $X$ is a smooth, complete variety over $\mathbb{C}$ in the algebraic category, where $X$ is not necessarily projective.

More generally, we don't have to be worried about converting between thinking about coherent sheaves on the formal scheme and thinking about them as compatible systems of coherent sheaves on actual schemes. My question is, is there a known example of a formal scheme for which that system of global sections does not satisfy the Mittag-Leffler condition?

My professor mentioned the other day that given a morphism of varieties over an alg. closed field $k$: $f: X \rightarrow Y$, one should count fibres ""with multiplicity"". I have been trying to make sense of this. It is especially important for me if $Y$ is a curve and the fibres are divisors of $X$. So I looked in Hartshorne, dusted off my scheme knowledge, and rediscovered the scheme theoretic fibre $X_y := X \times_Y \text{Spec}(k(y))$ for some $y \in Y$. I worked out an example: $f: \mathbb{A}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{A}^2$, $(a,b) \mapsto (a^2,b)$. A calculation shows that the fibre over a point $(p,q)$ is the spectrum of $k[x,y]/(x^2-p,y-q) \cong k[x]/(x^2-p)$, which is reduced and consists of two different points if $p \neq 0$, and a nonreduced one point scheme if $p=0$. Really similarly $g: \mathbb{A}^1 \rightarrow \mathbb{A}^1$, $a \mapsto a^2$, then the fibre is the spectrum of $k[x]/(x^2-p)$. I mention these two examples since in one case, the points and fibres are divisors, in the other they are not. This is all no problem at all, however i am trying to translate this back into varieties, trying to make sense of what ""counting with multiplicities"" should mean. Now the questions. How does one translate this into the language of varieties? It seems obvious from the above that the fibre of $(0,q)$ should be $2(0,q)$, since this ""doubling"" is hidden in the structure sheaf. This would be especially important if the points were divisors, since then 2 times a point makes a lot of sense. But how to make this mathematically precise? As in, what is the actual mathematical procedure? I guess if we can factor the ideal by which we are modding out into prime ideals, we can count the prime factors (i.e. varieties) with multiplicity, BUT: is this factoring always possible? And is this the right method? I did a course on Riemann surfaces, there multiplicity was also defined: a holomorphic map is locally at a point always of the form $z \mapsto z^n$, then $n$ is the multiplicity of the map at that point. I'm quite sure the definitions agree, of course assuming $k=\mathbb{C}$ and the varieties to be smooth. Can anyone give an argument why?

So this is why i expected that there at least would be a notion of ""multiplicity"" in the language of varieties if the fibres were divisors.

There is a nice chapter in the Algebraic Geometry book by Görtz and Wedhorn which shows that the category of quasi-coherent sheaves on a scheme is contravariantly equivalent to a category of quasi-coherent bundles on $X$ . But their category of quasi-coherent bundles is made just so that it works out. The definition is not geometrically motivated in the book. Also the pseudo-invers is not the sheaf of sections construction, which is dissatisfying.

You pick a scheme $X$ and view as an object in one of the big topoi via the functor of points approach. For simplicitly, let me take the big Zariski topos $Zar$ . There is a local geometric morphism $\pi: Zar/X \to Sh(X)$ from the big topos of $X$ to the little. Its pushforward part $\pi_\ast$ takes a space over $X$ to its sheaf of section. It has a left adjoint $\pi^{-1}$ and one defines a fully faithful covariant functor $\pi^\ast:Mod(\mathcal O_X)\to Mod_{Zar/X}(\mathbb A_X)$ by setting $\pi^\ast\mathcal F = \pi^{-1}\mathcal F\otimes_{\pi^{-1}\mathcal O_X}\mathbb A_X$ . A detailed construction and a proof that this functor is fully faithful can be found at the beginning of part 2 of Ingo Blechschmidt's PhD thesis. In fact, $\pi_\ast \pi^\ast = id$ . The second construction is already mentioned above. It is contravariant and works only for quasicoherent modules, but it always produces an $\mathbb A_X$ -module which is a scheme.

The $\mathcal O_X$ -algebra $Sym(\mathcal F)$ is $\mathbb N$ -graded, and hence we get an $(\mathbb A_X,\cdot)$ -monoid action on $V(\mathcal F)$ . This is the first part of what we need to turn $V(\mathcal F)$ into an $\mathbb A_X$ -module. What is left is to define the addition map. For that we switch to a local chart affine chart $U$ of $X$ . We need a morphism $$ +: Spec(\,Sym(\mathcal F(U)))\times_U Spec(Sym(\mathcal F(U)))\to Spec(Sym(\mathcal F(U)))  $$ relative $U$ . This is the same thing as an $\mathcal O(U)$ algebra map $$Sym(\mathcal F(U))\to Sym(\mathcal F(U)) \otimes_{\mathcal O(U)} Sym(\mathcal F(U))$$ which in turn is the same thing as an $\mathcal O(U)$ -module map $$\mathcal F(U) \to Sym(\mathcal F(U))\otimes_{\mathcal O(U)} Sym(\mathcal F(U))$$ We take the map which sends $f$ to $f\otimes 1 + 1\otimes f$ and we are done.

(Since we want to work as geometric as possible, all constructions and spaces are defined over $\mathbb{C}$ ) Harris wrote: As indicated, we can generalize this to a construction of rational normal curves in any projective space $\mathbb{P}^d$ . Specifically, start by choosing $d$ codimension two linear spaces $ \Lambda_i \cong \mathbb{P}^{d-2} \subset \mathbb{P}^d$ . The family $\{H_i(\lambda)\}$ of hyperplanes in $\mathbb{P}^d$ containing $\Lambda_i$ is then parameterized by $\lambda \in \mathbb{P}^1$ ; choose such parameterizations, subject to the condition that for each $\lambda$ the planes $H_1(\lambda), ... , H_d(\lambda)$ are independent, i.e., intersect in a point $p(\lambda)$ . It is then the case that the locus of these points $p(\lambda)$ as $\lambda$ varies in $\mathbb{P}^1$ is a rational normal curve. Exercise 1.24. Verify the last statement So our constructed curve $C$ is given by $$ C:= \bigcup_{\lambda \in \mathbb{P}^{1}} H_1(\lambda) \cap ... \cap H_d(\lambda)  $$ On page 10 Harris gave the standard definition of a rational normal curve : A rational normal curve is defined as the image of the map $v_d: \mathbb{P}^1 \to \mathbb{P}^d;  \lambda \mapsto [A_0(\lambda):...: A_d(\lambda)]$ with an arbitrary basis $A_0, ... , A_d$ of the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree $d$ on $\mathbb{P}^1 $ . Note that this curve is projectively equivalent to the image of the Veronese map $[X_0:X_1] \mapsto [X_0^d: X_0^{d-1}X_1:..., X_1^d]$ . The exercise: Suppose we start by choosing $d$ codimension two linear spaces $\Lambda_i \cong \mathbb{P}^{d-2} \subset \mathbb{P}^d,  i=1,...,d$ ( here I doubt that the $\Lambda_i$ can be choosen really arbitrary!) and consider $d$ families of hyperplanes $\{H_i(\lambda) \}_{\lambda \in \mathbb{P}^1}, i=1, ..., d$ where each $ H_i(\lambda)$ contains $\Lambda_i$ parametrized by the line $\mathbb{P}^1$ such that for each $\lambda \in \mathbb{P}^1$ the planes $H_1(\lambda),..., H_d(\lambda)$ are linear independent, i.e. intersect in a point $p(\lambda)$ . That is we have to check that the constructed curve $C$ above can be realized as the image of such map $v_d$ , that means that the map $$ p: \mathbb{P}^1 \to \mathbb{P}^d, \lambda \to p(\lambda)=  H_1(\lambda) \cap ... \cap H_d(\lambda) $$ has the form $\lambda \to [A_0(\lambda):...: A_d(\lambda)]$ for appropriate basis $A_0,..., A_d$ of the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree $d$ on $\mathbb{P}^1$ . The way I tried to solve it contains a serious problem, see below. We parametrize every linear space $\Lambda_i$ as vanishing set of two independent linear polynomials $L_i, M_i \in \mathbb{C} \cdot Z_0 + \mathbb{C} \cdot Z_1... +  \mathbb{C} \cdot Z_d $ . So $\Lambda_i= V(L_i, M_i)$ . Then every our pencil $\{H_i(\lambda) \}_{\lambda \in \mathbb{P}^1}$ can be parametrized as vanishing set $$ \lambda_0 L_i + \lambda_1 M_i =0 $$ with running $\lambda=[\lambda_0: \lambda_1]$ . If we reordner the terms after variables $Z_i$ we obtain $d$ equitions $$   \lambda_0 L_i + \lambda_1 M_i =  r_{i,Z_0} (\lambda)Z_0+ r_{i,Z_1} (\lambda)Z_1 + ... + r_{i, Z_d} (\lambda)Z_d =0  $$ We can naturaly encode the coefficents of $i$ -th family as $i$ -th row of following matrix $R \in Mat_{d+1}(\mathbb{C}[\lambda])$ ; the $(n+1)$ -row we fill with zeroes: $$ \begin{pmatrix} r_{1,Z_0} (\lambda) & r_{1,Z_1} (\lambda) & ... & r_{1,Z_d} (\lambda) \\ r_{2,Z_0} (\lambda) & r_{2,Z_1} (\lambda) & ... & r_{2,Z_d} (\lambda)\\ \\ ...  \\ \\ ...  \\ r_{d,Z_0} (\lambda) & r_{d,Z_1} (\lambda) & ... & r_{d,Z_d} (\lambda)\\ 0 & 0 & ... & 0 \\ \end{pmatrix} $$ Since for every $\lambda$ the $H_1(\lambda), ..., H_d(\lambda)$ are independent, this matrix $A$ has rank $d$ . What we do next looks promissing at first glance; we consider the adjugate matrix $A$ of $R$ , that's a unique matrix $A \in Mat_{d+1}(\mathbb{C}[\lambda])$ with $$ AR=RA= det(R) \cdot I_{n+1} = 0   $$ By definition of adjugate matrix it's $d+1$ -th column $A_{\cdot, n+1}$ provides exactly the solution we are looking for: for every $\lambda$ it is up to multiplication by a scalar $c \neq 0$ the solution of linear equations encoded by matrix $R$ and every entry of this column is by construction a homogeneous polynomial of degree $d$ in $\lambda_0, \lambda_1$ , let set $$  (A_0(\lambda), ... , A_d(\lambda)):= A_{\cdot, n+1}^T $$ and pass to it's homogenization. Problem (a really serious one): Why are the $A_i $ linearly independent, equivalently why they form a basis of the space of homogeneous deg $d$ polynomials in $\lambda_0, \lambda_1$ ? (see also the comment by lhl73 in this closely related question dealing with nondegeneracy of curves of this type separately) Indeed, that's equivalent to the property that the image of $\lambda \mapsto [A_0(\lambda):...: A_d(\lambda)]$ is not contained in a proper hyperplane $H \cong \mathbb{P}^{d-1} \subset \mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ . And if we looking again at the construction, Harris nowhere imposed additional assumptions how the $\Lambda_i$ are related to each other; it doesn't rule out eg the bad case $\Lambda_1= \Lambda_2$ , since one can find still two families $\{H_i(\lambda)\}, i=1,2$ of hyperplanes containing $\Lambda_1 (=\Lambda_2)$ with $H_1(\lambda) \neq H_2(\lambda)$ for every $\lambda$ , so the imposed condition is not violated. But eg if we choose $\Lambda_1= \Lambda_2$ by construction the complete curve $C$ would be comtained in $\Lambda_1$ , therefore the $A_i(\lambda)$ constructed as above will cannot be linearly independent and the curve will not be rational normal curve as defined by Harris on page 10. Question: Does anybody have experience with this Exercise 1.24 and knows how to solve it correctly, or if it's indeed true that the quoted construction not always gives a rational normal curve in sense of Harris book? (there is also nowhere Errata of this book available) Probably Harris also has forgotten to impose an additional assumption on the spaces $\Lambda_i$ in the construction above or I'm just too stupid to solve the exercise & understand the construction. If that's so, can the construction be slightly modified in a most general way when one would obtain always a rational normal curve? E.g. does the construction give us always rational normal curve if we additionally require that all $\Lambda_i$ should be distinct? In any case I would be very thankful if anybody who has experience with this Exercise and construction would share how it can be solved correctly.","I have a question about solvability of Exercise 1.24 (p. 14) from Joe Harris' Algebraic Geometry: A First Course and correctness of following 'synthetic' construction which according to the book (or alternatively due to page 79 in this script ) should give us a rational normal curve. (Since we want to work as geometric as possible, all constructions and spaces are defined over ) Harris wrote: As indicated, we can generalize this to a construction of rational normal curves in any projective space . Specifically, start by choosing codimension two linear spaces . The family of hyperplanes in containing is then parameterized by ; choose such parameterizations, subject to the condition that for each the planes are independent, i.e., intersect in a point . It is then the case that the locus of these points as varies in is a rational normal curve. Exercise 1.24. Verify the last statement So our constructed curve is given by On page 10 Harris gave the standard definition of a rational normal curve : A rational normal curve is defined as the image of the map with an arbitrary basis of the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree on . Note that this curve is projectively equivalent to the image of the Veronese map . The exercise: Suppose we start by choosing codimension two linear spaces ( here I doubt that the can be choosen really arbitrary!) and consider families of hyperplanes where each contains parametrized by the line such that for each the planes are linear independent, i.e. intersect in a point . That is we have to check that the constructed curve above can be realized as the image of such map , that means that the map has the form for appropriate basis of the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree on .

Then every our pencil can be parametrized as vanishing set with running . If we reordner the terms after variables we obtain equitions We can naturaly encode the coefficents of -th family as -th row of following matrix ; the -row we fill with zeroes: Since for every the are independent, this matrix has rank . What we do next looks promissing at first glance; we consider the adjugate matrix of , that's a unique matrix with By definition of adjugate matrix it's -th column provides exactly the solution we are looking for: for every it is up to multiplication by a scalar the solution of linear equations encoded by matrix and every entry of this column is by construction a homogeneous polynomial of degree in , let set and pass to it's homogenization.

But isn't it true that every quasi-compact $T_0$  space has a closed point? A minimal closed set must be reduced to a point. So I'm unclear why ""quasi-compactness"" alone is not enough. (It shouldn't be enough. Grothendieck is not one to mince hypotheses!) Questions: Where does the standard argument break down for schemes which are only quasi-compact? Is this true if $X$ is only quasi-separated and quasi-compact? (Are there counterexamples otherwise?)",,"['algebraic-geometry', 'schemes']"

Suppose we have a covering $\{U_i\}$ of $X$ and morphisms $f_i :U_i \to Y$ such that $f_i|_{U_i \cap U_j} = f_j|_{U_i \cap U_j}$ for every $i,j$. The bar just denotes ordinary restriction of morphisms to a subspace. Then there is a morphism $f : X \to Y$ such that $f|_{U_i} = f_i$. Now the obvious choice for a morphism $f(x) = f_i(x)$ if $x \in U_i$ should work. Indeed for every $i$ we have maps $f_i^\sharp : \mathcal{O}_Y \to {f_i}_\ast(\mathcal{O}_X|_{U_i})$ and using this I want to build a morphism $f^\sharp : \mathcal{O}_Y \to f_\ast \mathcal{O}_X$.  It suffices to define $f^\sharp$ open set by open set so choose $V \subseteq Y$ open.

97,The Chern class of a Kähler manifold,The Chern class of a Kähler manifold,,"This question refers mainly to this mathoverflow question and its answer. Statement 1 The well known result of Aubin and Yau states that if $X$ is a compact Kähler manifold with negative first Chern class, $c_1(X)<0$ , then it will allow a Kähler-Einstein metric $g$ such that: \begin{equation} \text{Ric} = -g \end{equation} where by $\text{Ric}$ I mean the Ricci curvature. I won't pretend that I understand the proof of this result, but it is used frequently and is discussed in the mathoverflow thread I mentioned above. Statement 2 The answer in the above thread then goes on to say (and I have seen this statement in several papers that I am trying to understand, such as this one by Kobayashi and this one by F. Catanese and A. Di Scala) that if the canonical bundle of $X$ is ample then $c_1(X) <0$ and so by statement 1 we get the Kähler-Einstein metric $g$ . So: 1) What exactly do we mean by the first Chern class of of a complex manifold? I always thought that this referred to the first Chern class of the canonical bundle: $c_1(X) = c_1(K_X)$ where $K_X = \bigwedge ^{n}\Omega_X$ and $\Omega_X$ is the holomorphic cotangent bundle, but... 2) If $K_X$ is ample, is it not true that it has positive first Chern class?

There are examples of compact complex manifolds with no positive-dimensional compact complex submanifolds.

The proof of this fact, see this answer for example, shows that these tori also have no positive-dimensional analytic subvarieties either (because analytic subvarieties also have a fundamental class).
