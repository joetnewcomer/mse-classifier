So first of all the integral is zero if n is odd, since then it is an odd integrand integrated over a symmetric interval. My choice for the complex contour is a rectangle with sidelength $2R$ (on the real axis) and the other $2\pi i$ , because the denominator is the same for $x \rightarrow x+2\pi i$ and $I = \lim_{R\rightarrow \infty} \int_{\gamma_1}f(z)dz$ . I define the contour $\gamma = \gamma_1 + \gamma_2 + \gamma_3 + \gamma_4$ , where $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_3$ are the two long, horizontal sides (with length $2R$ ) and $\gamma_2$ and $\gamma_4$ the two vertical ones. Then there is one pole of order 2 inside the region of integration at $z_0 = i\pi$ . $\int_{\gamma_2} f(z)dz + \int_{\gamma_4}f(z)dz = \int_0^{2\pi i} \frac{(t+R)^n}{(\exp(t+R)+1)(\exp(-t-R)+1)}dt - \int_0^{2\pi i} \frac{(-t+2\pi i-R)^n}{(\exp(-t-R)+1)(\exp(+t+R)+1)}dt = 0 + 0$ individually when $R\rightarrow \infty$ .

Prove that $$|\int_a^b xf(x)dx| \leq \frac{M}{4}(b-a)^2.$$ Can anyone help verify my proof? Here are my own attempts: My attempt: Write $I_a(x) = \int_a^xf(t)dt$ , $\,$ $I_b(x) = \int_b^xf(t)dt$ , $\,$ and denote by $c$ the midpoint $\frac{a+b}{2}$ of the inteval $[a,b]$ . We can see that $$\int_a^cxf(x)dx = \int_a^cxI_a^{'}(x)dx = cI_a(c) - aI_a(a) - \int_a^cI_a(x)dx = cI_a(c) - \int_a^cI_a(x)dx.$$ For the same reason $$\int_b^cxf(x)dx = cI_b(c) - \int_b^cI_b(x)dx.$$ So the left hand side of the original inequality can be written as $$|\int_a^bxf(x)dx| = |\int_a^cxf(x)dx - \int_b^cxf(x)dx|\\ = |c(I_a(c)-I_b(c))+\int_b^cI_b(x)dx-\int_a^cI_a(x)dx| \\= |\int_b^cI_b(x)dx-\int_a^cI_a(x)dx|$$ since $I_a(c)-I_b(c) = \int_a^bf(x)dx = 0$ . $\int_b^yI_b(x)dx$ can be viewed as a function $\Phi_b(y)$ of $y$ . By Taylor formula, $$\Phi_b(y) = \Phi_b(b) + \Phi_b^{'}(b)(y-b)+\frac{1}{2}\Phi_b^{''}(\theta_2)(y-b)^2 \\ =  \frac{1}{2}f(\theta_2)(y-b)^2$$ where $\theta_2 \in (y,b)$ .

By a similar argument $\int_a^cI_a(x)dx = \frac{1}{2}f(\theta_1)(\frac{b-a}{2})^2$ , where $\theta_1 \in (a,c)$ . So $$|\int_a^bxf(x)dx| = |\int_b^cI_b(x)dx-\int_a^cI_a(x)dx| \\= \frac{1}{2}(\frac{b-a}{2})^2|f(\theta_1) - f(\theta_2)| \\ \leq \frac{1}{2}(\frac{b-a}{2})^2(|f(\theta_1)| + |f(\theta_2)|) \\ \leq \frac{1}{2}(\frac{b-a}{2})^2(2M)  = \frac{M}{4}({b-a})^2$$ because $|f(\theta_i)|\leq M$ .","Problem: Let be a continuous function on , such that and .

This integral has two inputs, $x$ which is the distance to the edge and $s$ which is the slope from the origin to the corner point. To help with avoiding high degree components the slope needs be no larger than 1 (if the slope is originally larger than 1 the inputs are swapped and the result used to subtract to $\operatorname{erf}(x)\operatorname{erf}(s)$ ). $$\int_0^x \frac{\operatorname{erf}(t s) \exp(-t^2)}{2\sqrt{\pi}}\, dt$$ I tried to approximate it in the $x = [-3 , 3], s = [-1 , 1]$ range with a simple 2D Chebyshev approximation, however to achieve my desired maximum absolute error of about $4\cdot10^{-5}$ I need about 31 coefficients in my 2D polynomial. That's a bit much, ideally I would be able to use fewer operations. I have tried to improve the situation by applying operations to the integral before fitting, such as the reciprocal, dividing by $x$ or $s$ or trying to somehow use the limits to gain some sort of advantage, like making a polynomial to interpolate between the limit at $s=0$ (which is $\frac{1-\exp(-x^2)}{2\pi}$ ) and the integral at $s=1$ (which is $\frac{{\operatorname{erf}(x)}^2}{8}$ ), or somehow use the limit at $x=\inf$ (which for my purposes is very close to what we have at $x=3$ ) which is $\frac{\arctan(s)}{2\pi}$ , but this didn't help much in achieving more precision with fewer polynomial coefficients.

To solve this integral we make a change of coordinates with $u=\sqrt{xy}$ and $v=\sqrt{\frac{y}{x}}$ . Furthermore, in the region of integration we have $x>0$ and $y>0$ . Then $u^2=xy$ y $v^2=\frac{y}{x}$ , so we have: \begin{align*}     v^2 &=\frac{y}{x}\\     x^2v^2 &= xy\\     x^2v^2 &= u^2. \end{align*} \begin{align*}     x^2 &= \frac{u^2}{v^2}\\     x &= \frac{u}{v}. \end{align*} Observation: $x=-\frac{u}{v}$ is not taken, because $x>0$ in the $R$ region.
