14,Tensor product of monoids and arbitrary algebraic structures,Tensor product of monoids and arbitrary algebraic structures,,"Question. Do you know a specific example which demonstrates that the tensor product of monoids (as defined below) is not associative? Let $C$ be the category of algebraic structures of a fixed type, and let us denote by $|~|$ the underlying functor $C \to \mathsf{Set}$. For $M,N \in C$ we have a functor $\mathrm{BiHom}(M,N;-) : C \to \mathsf{Set}$ which sends an object $K \in C$ to the set of bihomomorphisms $M \times N \to K$, i.e. maps $|M| \times |N| \to |K|$ which are homomorphisms in each variable when the other one is fixed. Then one can show as usual that $\mathrm{BiHom}(M,N;-)$ is representable and call the universal bihomomorphism $M \times N \to M \otimes N$ the tensor product of $M,N$. This is a straight forward generalization of the well-known case $C=\mathsf{Mod}(R)$ for a commutative ring $R$. Actually, this is a special case of a more general tensor product in concrete categories, studied in the paper ""Tensor products and bimorphisms"", Canad. Math. Bull. 19 (1976) 385-401, by B. Banaschewski and E. Nelson. Here are some examples: For $C=\mathsf{Set}$, the tensor product equals the usual cartesian product. This is also true for $C=\mathsf{Set}_*$. For $C=\mathsf{Grp}$, we get $G \otimes H \cong G^{\mathsf{ab}} \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} H^{\mathsf{ab}}$, using the Eckmann-Hilton argument . (This differs from the ""tensor product of groups"" studied in the literature). The case $C=\mathsf{CMon}$ is very similar to the well-known case $C=\mathsf{Ab}$ and is spelled out here ; namely, we have internal homs and therefore a hom-tensor-adjunction. The same is true for $C=\mathsf{Mod}(\Lambda)$ for a commutative algebraic monad $\Lambda$, see here , Section 5.3. Note that the tensor product is commutative, and that it commutes with filtered colimits in each variable. However, the case $C=\mathsf{Grp}$ shows that it does not have to commute with coproducts. In particular, tensoring with some object is no left adjoint. Also, the free object on one generator is not a unit in general: Let us consider $C=\mathsf{Mon}$. Then, we have $\mathbb{N} \otimes M = M / \{ (mn)^p = m^p n^p \}_{m,n \in M, p \in \mathbb{N}}$ The usual proof of the associativity of the tensor product breaks down: There is a map $\beta : M \times (N \otimes K) \to (M \otimes N) \otimes K$ mapping $(m, n \otimes k) \mapsto (m \otimes n) \otimes k$, which is a homomorphism in the second variable.

Then $(A,<_A)$ and $(B,<_B)$ are said to be of the same type if there exists a bijection $f \colon A \to B$ such that $a_1 <_A a_2$ implies that $f(a_1) <_B f(a_2)$ for any pair of elements $a_1$, $a_2$ of $A$. Furthermore, the dictionary, or lexicographical, order $<_L$ on the Cartesian product  $A\times B$ is defined as follows: $a_1 \times b_1 <_L a_2 \times b_2$ if and only if the following holds: Either $a_1 <_A a_2$, or $a_1 =a_2 $ and $b_1 <_B b_2$. Now let's consider the two sets  $Z^+ \times [0,1)$ and  $ [0,1) \times Z^+$, where $Z^+$ denotes the set of positive integers and $[0,1)$ denotes the set of all non-negative reals less than $1$, both under the usual order. Let us give both these Cartesian products the dictionary, or lexicographical, order. Then how to rigorously prove, using the above definition, that these two sets have different order types? I know that the set $Z^+ \times [0,1)$ has the same order type as the set of  non-negative real numbers under the usual order, for we can define the map $ f \colon Z^+ \times [0,1) \to [0,+\infty)$ as $$f(n\times t) \colon = n + t - 1$$ for all $n \in Z^+$ and all $t \in [0,1)$. This map is an order-preserving bijection. I also know that every element $t \times n$ of the set $[0,1) \times Z^+$ has an immediate successor, namely the element $t \times (n+1)$. However, this is not the case for the set $Z^+ \times [0,1)$, for if we take any two elements of this set, say, $n_1 \times t_1$ and $n_2 \times t_2$ such that $n_1 \times t_1 <_L n_2 \times t_2$, then either $n_1 < n_2$, or $n_1 = n_2$ and $t_1 < t_2$, where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are positive integers and $t_1$ and $t_2$ are real numbers in the interval $[0,1)$. If $n_1 < n_2$, then the element $n_1 \times (t_1 +1)/2$, for example, satisfies $n_1 \times t_1 <_L n_1 \times (t_1+1)/2$ and $n_1 \times (t_1 +1)/2 <_L n_2 \times t_2$. In fact, an element of the form $n_1 \times (\alpha t_1 + 1 -\alpha)$ or $n_2 \times (\alpha t_2)$ would do, where $0 < \alpha <1$. Similarly, if $n_1 = n = n_2$  and $t_1 < t_2$, then the element $n \times (\alpha t_1 + (1 - \alpha) t_2 )$, where $0 < \alpha < 1$ as before, satisfies $n_1 \times t_1 <_L n \times (\alpha t_1 + (1 - \alpha) t_2 )$ and $n \times (\alpha t_1 + (1 - \alpha) t_2 ) <_L n_2 \times t_2$.

Now let's consider the two sets  $Z^+ \times [0,1)$ and  $ [0,1) \times Z^+$, where $Z^+$ denotes the set of positive integers and $[0,1)$ denotes the set of all non-negative reals less than $1$, both under the usual order. Let us give both these Cartesian products the dictionary, or lexicographical, order. Then how to rigorously prove, using the above definition, that these two sets have different order types? I know that the set $Z^+ \times [0,1)$ has the same order type as the set of  non-negative real numbers under the usual order, for we can define the map $ f \colon Z^+ \times [0,1) \to [0,+\infty)$ as $$f(n\times t) \colon = n + t - 1$$ for all $n \in Z^+$ and all $t \in [0,1)$. This map is an order-preserving bijection. I also know that every element $t \times n$ of the set $[0,1) \times Z^+$ has an immediate successor, namely the element $t \times (n+1)$. However, this is not the case for the set $Z^+ \times [0,1)$, for if we take any two elements of this set, say, $n_1 \times t_1$ and $n_2 \times t_2$ such that $n_1 \times t_1 <_L n_2 \times t_2$, then either $n_1 < n_2$, or $n_1 = n_2$ and $t_1 < t_2$, where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are positive integers and $t_1$ and $t_2$ are real numbers in the interval $[0,1)$. If $n_1 < n_2$, then the element $n_1 \times (t_1 +1)/2$, for example, satisfies $n_1 \times t_1 <_L n_1 \times (t_1+1)/2$ and $n_1 \times (t_1 +1)/2 <_L n_2 \times t_2$. In fact, an element of the form $n_1 \times (\alpha t_1 + 1 -\alpha)$ or $n_2 \times (\alpha t_2)$ would do, where $0 < \alpha <1$. Similarly, if $n_1 = n = n_2$  and $t_1 < t_2$, then the element $n \times (\alpha t_1 + (1 - \alpha) t_2 )$, where $0 < \alpha < 1$ as before, satisfies $n_1 \times t_1 <_L n \times (\alpha t_1 + (1 - \alpha) t_2 )$ and $n \times (\alpha t_1 + (1 - \alpha) t_2 ) <_L n_2 \times t_2$. Thus we have shown that between any two distinct elements of the set $Z^+ \times [0,1)$, there is another element of $Z^+ \times [0,1)$, in fact there are infinitley many elements.",,"['general-topology', 'analysis', 'elementary-set-theory', 'order-theory']"

75,flaw in the proof of Cantor's theorem? does the set of all sets exist?,flaw in the proof of Cantor's theorem? does the set of all sets exist?,,"I decided to improve my question since there were mistakes pointed out (THANK YOU!) and I realized that I did not mention if I put any kind of axiomatic conditions on the sets which I consider. I have a good math background (numerical analysis/mathematical statistics/linear algebra), but I am a biologist, so mathematicians please consider that, try defining what you are talking about. First of all, I operate under the assumption that my sets (any definable collections) do not obey any kind of axioms, except that they (collections) should be logically defined. For example set X=[{x∈R:0>x>1} and X ≠∅] is not defined logically for me, because it leads to a paradox: 0>1. Any set whose definition leads to a paradox is not logically defined, because we are doing mathematics, there should be no paradoxes. Thus, for me, ""the set of all sets which do not contain themselves"" is not a set, because its definition leads to a paradox. This set does not exist. Note: I do not operate under naive set theory. Naive set theory assumes as an axiom, to be more precise a principle, called comprehension principle: ""Given any property, there is a set which consists of all objects having that property."" This principle leads to paradoxes, thus it is not logical for me. For me a set is logically defined when it is clear what it is from definition and definition does not lead to paradoxes or any kind of illogical things. Lets call it ""logical set theory"". Second, here is my question. Many books prove that the set of all sets does not exist using Cantor's theorem: for any set X its Cardinality is strictly less than the Cardinality of a set consisting of all subsets of X. I am here to say that I think that one can not use this theorem as a proof of this point: the set of all sets does not exist. Actually one member of the forum already asked this question : can we use this theorem to prove this fact? ""Is this prove correct?"" Note: nobody answered yes or no. My answer is solid NO. But I am not 100% sure. Thus, I am providing my explanation for my ""NO"" and I am asking members of this forum whether they think that I am wrong. And if I am wrong, I would like to know why. If one assumes that all valid sets have to obey ZFC axioms, then one need not prove the point using Cantor's theorem, because ""the set of all sets"" is not a valid set in ZFC theory, because it does not obey the Axiom of Regularity, for example. If one assumes that all valid sets have to obey ""naive"" theory comprehension principle: then we are not talking about something logical, we are are not doing math. So forget about it. If one assumes that all valid sets have to obey New Foundation axioms, then, as member of this forum pointed out - the set of all sets does exist, it is ok-set, thus we do not need to prove that it does not exist. If one assumes that all valid sets have to obey Cantor's rules, then actually as a person on this forum pointed out, Cantor's conception of sets rules out the set of all sets. Thus, we do not need to prove the point, because the set of all sets does not exist under Cantor's conception. If one assumes that all valid sets have to obey ""logical theory of sets"", then it is easy to find one to one correspondence between the elements of set of all sets and elements of its power set: s=f(x)=x. So these sets are equinumerous, and one can not prove the opposite. Finally, it is clear to see that the point (the sets of all sets does not exist) is easily proven from Cantor's theorem. Thus, if we proved that the point is not true (under the ""logical set theory""), and I do think that it is not true (under the ""logical set theory""), when we have to find a mistake in the prove given by Cantor, using logical set theory. Here I am providing a proof by Cantor and point out the mistake later on: The mistake leads to the conclusion that this theorem is true for any set X except for ""a set of all sets"" in the universe. Thus one can not derive that the ""set of all sets does not exist"" based on Cantor's theorem. Here is the proof of Cantor's theorem: Definitions: a)sets are called equinumerous if there exists one-to-one correspondence between its elements. b)cardinality of set X is considered less than cardinality of set Y if a subset of Y is equinumerous to X, but no subset of X is equinumerous to Y. Lemma: let S be a set of subsets of X such that S is equinumerous to X. Then there exists a subset of X (call it A), such that it is not contained in S (A ∉ S). (PS, it is easy to see that the theorem automatically follows from the Lemma: lets assume that the theorem is not true, than there exists a set X such that it is equinumerous to the set consisting of all its subsets (call it S). But such a set S satisfies the conditions of the Lemma. Thus there exists a subset of X that is not contained in S. But this is absurd, thus we have a contradiction and S can not be equinumerous to X.) Proof of Lemma: All we have to do is to define A and prove that is satisfies the conditions of lemma: it should be a subset of X, such that it is not contained in S (A ∉ S). Lets take any S, that satisfies the conditions of lemma (a set of subsets of X such that S is equinumerous to X). Let f(x)=s is the one-to-one function that images the elements of X (x) into elements of S(s). Then, A is defined as: A={x ∈ X: x ∉ f(x)}. That is A is a subset of X, such that for every element x of A: x is not contained in s=f(x). Then we assume that A∈S and find a contradiction (explained below). Thus A∉S and the Lemma is proven. The contradiction is the following: If A∈S, then exists element of X (call it e), such that A=f(e). If e∉A than e∉f(e)=A - contradiction (because from the definition of A follows that if e ∉ f(e): e should be contained in A). If e∈A than e∈f(e)=A, that is not possible by the definition of A, thus there is also a contradiction. Lemma (and the theorem) is proven. I saw other proofs on the internet and in books, but all of them define a set A={x ∈ X: x ∉ f(x)}. I highlighted the mistake in bold. Indeed, lets ask, is A logically defined for a set X=set of all sets? Let X=""set of all sets in the universe"". Let S be a set that contains all subsets of X. Let s=f(x)=x (that is possible only for a ""set of all sets in the universe""). Now look at the definition of A: the set A is not logically defined: there is no such a set with elements of X, such that x ∉ f(x), because x ∉ f(x) for all x. In fact A can not be even an empty set: because even for empty set: f(empty set)=empty set, thus empty set ≠ A. Thus A is still undefined. I saw another proof of the fact that the ""set of all sets"" does not exist: they use Russell's paradox. But I already told that I am not operating under the comprehension principle, because it is nonsense. Any mathematicians here? please let me know if there is a flaw in my arguments.

90,"Why does ""Naive Set Theory"" by Halmos allow the universal set despite admitting its non-existence?","Why does ""Naive Set Theory"" by Halmos allow the universal set despite admitting its non-existence?",,"Halmos openly says that the universe doesn't exist: there is no universe But several pages later Halmos says: In order to record the basic facts about complementation as simply as possible, we assume nevertheless (in this section only) that all the sets to be mentioned are subsets of one and the same set E and that all complements (unless otherwise specified) are formed relative to that E. In such situations (and they are quite common) it is easier to remember the underlying set E than to keep writing it down, and this makes it possible to simplify the notation. An often used symbol for the temporarily absolute (as opposed to relative) complement of A is A′. The following rule from the book killed all my hopes that E isn't the universal set: $$E^{\prime} = \varnothing$$ This seems like blatant self-contradiction with previous statement that there is no universe. I hope to resolve it, but I have almost no ideas what it can mean. My only guess is that it's some kind of ""lie to children"", when relatively simple lie is told because the teacher believes that his/her student(s) can't yet comprehend the whole truth. P.S. In my other question I got comments that can probably shed some light on the problem. looking at the image you posted, I believe you are confusing two different scenarios. In many applications of set theory, there is a universal set at hand. For example, if we are studying natural numbers, the universal set for that purpose may be the set of all natural numbers. All of the rules for set complement assume that a temporary universal set has been chosen in that way. The other context is in studying formal set theory, such as ZFC. In this context, there is no single universal set that contains all sets.( Carl Mummert ) And another: If your book isn't specifically on mathematical set theory, then the complement is usually taken with respect to a not explicitly stated super set U. E.g. the complement of the set of even numbers is probably meant to be the set of odd numbers, as the super set might be the natural numbers. This should be clear from the context. ( M.Winter ) These comments give weak hope, but alas they don't seem to solve the conflict. If anything, they create new one: conclusion from them is in contradiction with statement that absolute coplement of E is the empty set. For example, let's assume that E is equal to set of natural numbers N. It contains only natural numbers as its elements, but not sets of natural numbers (like it doesn't contain set {1,2,3} as its element). Thus complement of E wouldn't be empty as Halmos assures, it would contain such sets like {1,2,3}, {1,7,65382, 3235464567765}, etc. as its elements. Even worse, I doubt that complement of set E under such circumstances would even be a set in the first place, because it would contain everything that doesn't belong to set E, including set E and complement of set E itself . P.P.S. As Eric Wofsey pointed out, I missed consequences of phrase "" all the sets to be mentioned are subsets of E"". Indeed, then our complement set can't contain elements that aren't elements of E. In other words, our complement set of E must be subset of E! But at the same time they must have no any common elements. Complement of set E can't contain element that isn't element of set E, thus the only alternative is not contain any element at all, i.e. be the empty set because intersection of any set with empty set is empty set. And of course, under such considerations E doesn't necessarily contain itself as its member. @EricWofsey Thanks Eric! I think the question is solved. Halmos doesn't really allow the universe, I just got wrong conclusions from rule $E^{\prime} = \varnothing$ .","Halmos openly says that the universe doesn't exist: there is no universe But several pages later Halmos says: In order to record the basic facts about complementation as simply as possible, we assume nevertheless (in this section only) that all the sets to be mentioned are subsets of one and the same set E and that all complements (unless otherwise specified) are formed relative to that E.
