7,Is this Euler-Mascheroni constant calculation from double integrals a true identity?,Is this Euler-Mascheroni constant calculation from double integrals a true identity?,,"A prime number is a number that is only divisible by itself and one, that is the number of divisors of a prime number is equal to $2$. One way to illustrate this is to plot a matrix such that if the column index (1,2,3,...) divides the row index (1,2,3,...) then a black square is drawn at that column and row index intersection, like this: As a matrix this has the definition in Mathematica: MatrixForm[Table[Table[If[Mod[n, k] == 0, 1, 0 ], {k, 1, 12}], {n, 1, 12}]] which gives the table below: $$\small \left( \begin{array}{cccccccccccc}  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\  1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{array} \right)$$ The number of divisors of n, also called tau, is the row sums of this matrix and starts: 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 4, 3, 4, 2, 6 ... So at a row equal to a prime number there are only two black dots and the row sums in the above matrix are equal to 2. To find the ordinary generating function of the number of divisors of n we consider table $a$ times $b$, or row index times column index: MatrixForm[Table[Table[a*b, {b, 1, 12}], {a, 1, 12}]] $$\small \left( \begin{array}{cccccccccccc}  1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\  2 & 4 & 6 & 8 & 10 & 12 & 14 & 16 & 18 & 20 & 22 & 24 \\  3 & 6 & 9 & 12 & 15 & 18 & 21 & 24 & 27 & 30 & 33 & 36 \\  4 & 8 & 12 & 16 & 20 & 24 & 28 & 32 & 36 & 40 & 44 & 48 \\  5 & 10 & 15 & 20 & 25 & 30 & 35 & 40 & 45 & 50 & 55 & 60 \\  6 & 12 & 18 & 24 & 30 & 36 & 42 & 48 & 54 & 60 & 66 & 72 \\  7 & 14 & 21 & 28 & 35 & 42 & 49 & 56 & 63 & 70 & 77 & 84 \\  8 & 16 & 24 & 32 & 40 & 48 & 56 & 64 & 72 & 80 & 88 & 96 \\  9 & 18 & 27 & 36 & 45 & 54 & 63 & 72 & 81 & 90 & 99 & 108 \\  10 & 20 & 30 & 40 & 50 & 60 & 70 & 80 & 90 & 100 & 110 & 120 \\  11 & 22 & 33 & 44 & 55 & 66 & 77 & 88 & 99 & 110 & 121 & 132 \\  12 & 24 & 36 & 48 & 60 & 72 & 84 & 96 & 108 & 120 & 132 & 144 \end{array} \right)$$ By stretching out this table in the downward direction we get this table: MatrixForm[Table[Table[If[Mod[a, b] == 0, a, 0], {b, 1, 12}], {a, 1, 12}]] $$\small \left( \begin{array}{cccccccccccc}  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  2 & 2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  3 & 0 & 3 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  4 & 4 & 0 & 4 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  5 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 5 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  6 & 6 & 6 & 0 & 0 & 6 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  7 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 7 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  8 & 8 & 0 & 8 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 8 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  9 & 0 & 9 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 9 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  10 & 10 & 0 & 0 & 10 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 10 & 0 & 0 \\  11 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 11 & 0 \\  12 & 12 & 12 & 12 & 0 & 12 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 12 \end{array} \right)$$ This looks very much like the divisorplot at the beginning. To find the generating function for the number of divisors of $n$ we then introduce the variable $x$ like this: Clear[x] MatrixForm[  Table[Table[If[Mod[a, b] == 0, x^a, 0], {b, 1, 12}], {a, 1, 12}]] $$\small \left( \begin{array}{cccccccccccc}  x & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  x^2 & x^2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  x^3 & 0 & x^3 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  x^4 & x^4 & 0 & x^4 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  x^5 & 0 & 0 & 0 & x^5 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  x^6 & x^6 & x^6 & 0 & 0 & x^6 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  x^7 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & x^7 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  x^8 & x^8 & 0 & x^8 & 0 & 0 & 0 & x^8 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  x^9 & 0 & x^9 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & x^9 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  x^{10} & x^{10} & 0 & 0 & x^{10} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & x^{10} & 0 & 0 \\  x^{11} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & x^{11} & 0 \\  x^{12} & x^{12} & x^{12} & x^{12} & 0 & x^{12} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & x^{12} \end{array} \right)$$ The generating function for the number of divisors of $n$ is then the infinite double sum which is the sum of the infinite matrix above: $$\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} d(n)x^{n} = \sum\limits_{a=1}^{\infty} \sum\limits_{b=1}^{\infty} x^{a b}$$  $$= 1\, x^{1} + 2\, x^{2} +  2\, x^{3} +  3\, x^{4} +  2\, x^{5} +  4\, x^{6} +  2\, x^{7} +  4\, x^{8} +  3\, x^{9} +  4\, x^{10} + 2\, x^{11} +  6\, x^{12} +  ...$$ where $d(n)$ = the number of divisors of $n$ A sum $\sum$ is a sum of distances - usually under a function, while an integral $\int$ is a sum of areas under a function, and a double integral $\int \int$ is a sum of volumes and so on... Often in mathematics one wants to compare a sum to an integral, or at least so I have heard. In this case we have a double sum: $$\sum\limits_{a=1}^{\infty} \sum\limits_{b=1}^{\infty} x^{a b}$$ Considering the double integral instead we have: $$\int\limits_{a=1}^{\infty} \int\limits_{b=1}^{\infty} x^{a b}$$ As suggested by Chris's wise sister in the chat room about two weeks ago, the similar triple integral evaluates faster at $x=\frac{1}{e}$: According to Mathematica: Integrate[Integrate[1/Exp[1]^(a*b), {a, 1, Infinity}], {b, 1, Infinity}] the double integral then evaluates to: $$\int\limits_{a=1}^{\infty} \int\limits_{b=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{e^{a b}}=-\text{Ei}(-1)$$ Or as Mathematica calls it, the exponential integral. Reading about the exponential integral in Wikipedia that passing a logarithm as argument to it one gets the logarithmic integral and remembering that the logarithmic integral has to do with the prime number theorem, I did some experimenting in Mathematica with the program: Monitor[MatrixForm[   Table[Table[     Integrate[       Integrate[Exp[a*b], {a, k, Infinity},         GenerateConditions -> False], {b, 0, n},        GenerateConditions -> False] -       Integrate[       Integrate[Exp[a*b], {a, 0, n}, GenerateConditions -> False], {b,         k, Infinity}, GenerateConditions -> False], {n, 1, 4}], {k, 0,      4}]], k] and came to the conclusion that for $n \gt 0$ and $k \geq 0$, this appears to be an identity: $$\gamma = \int_0^n \left(\int_k^{\infty } e^{a b} \, da\right) \, db-\int_k^{\infty } \left(\int_0^n e^{a b} \, da\right) \, db$$ where $\gamma$ = Euler-Mascheroni constant , approximately equal to 0.57721566490153286060651209... My question is: Why is this identity true? I also noted that: For $k \lt 0$ and $n \lt 0$, it appears to be true that: $$\gamma = \Re(\int_0^n \left(\int_k^{\infty } e^{a b} \, da\right) \, db-\int_k^{\infty } \left(\int_0^n e^{a b} \, da\right) \, db)$$ $$-\pi = \Im(\int_0^n \left(\int_k^{\infty } e^{a b} \, da\right) \, db-\int_k^{\infty } \left(\int_0^n e^{a b} \, da\right) \, db)$$ But this is probably less interesting. As a starting point I believe it has something to do with the fact: -Integrate[Integrate[Exp[a*b], {a, 0, 1}, GenerateConditions -> False], {b, 0,     Infinity}, GenerateConditions -> False] $$\gamma = -\int_0^{\infty } \left(\int_0^1 e^{a b} \, da\right) \, db$$ and that it somehow can be separated out from both of the double integrals: $$\int_0^n \left(\int_k^{\infty } e^{a b} \, da\right) \, db$$ $$\int_k^{\infty } \left(\int_0^n e^{a b} \, da\right) \, db$$ depending on the values of $n$ and $k$ since: Monitor[MatrixForm[   Table[Table[     Integrate[       Integrate[Exp[a*b], {a, k, Infinity},         GenerateConditions -> False], {b, 0, n},        GenerateConditions -> False] -       0*Integrate[        Integrate[Exp[a*b], {a, 0, n},          GenerateConditions -> False], {b, k, Infinity},         GenerateConditions -> False], {n, 1, 4}], {k, 0, 4}]], k] Monitor[MatrixForm[   Table[Table[     0*Integrate[        Integrate[Exp[a*b], {a, k, Infinity},          GenerateConditions -> False], {b, 0, n},         GenerateConditions -> False] -       Integrate[       Integrate[Exp[a*b], {a, 0, n}, GenerateConditions -> False], {b,         k, Infinity}, GenerateConditions -> False], {n, 1, 4}], {k, 0,      4}]], k] for $n \geq 1$ and $k \geq 0$ we have for the first double integral: $$\int_0^n \left(\int_k^{\infty } e^{a b} \, da\right) \, db$$ (for $n=1,2,3,4...$ and $k=0,1,2,3,4...$): $$\small \left( \begin{array}{cccc}  0 & -\log (2) & -\log (3) & -\log (4) \\  \gamma -\text{Ei}(1) & \gamma -\text{Ei}(2) & \gamma -\text{Ei}(3) & \gamma -\text{Ei}(4) \\  -\text{Ei}(2)+\gamma +\log (2) & -\text{Ei}(4)+\gamma +\log (2) & -\text{Ei}(6)+\gamma +\log (2) & -\text{Ei}(8)+\gamma +\log (2) \\  -\text{Ei}(3)+\gamma +\log (3) & -\text{Ei}(6)+\gamma +\log (3) & -\text{Ei}(9)+\gamma +\log (3) & -\text{Ei}(12)+\gamma +\log (3) \\  -\text{Ei}(4)+\gamma +\log (4) & -\text{Ei}(8)+\gamma +\log (4) & -\text{Ei}(12)+\gamma +\log (4) & -\text{Ei}(16)+\gamma +\log (4) \end{array} \right)$$ and for the second double integral: $$-\int_k^{\infty } \left(\int_0^n e^{a b} \, da\right) \, db)$$ (for $n=1,2,3,4...$ and $k=0,1,2,3,4...$): $$\small \left( \begin{array}{cccc}  \gamma  & \gamma +\log (2) & \gamma +\log (3) & \gamma +\log (4) \\  \text{Ei}(1) & \text{Ei}(2) & \text{Ei}(3) & \text{Ei}(4) \\  \text{Ei}(2)-\log (2) & \text{Ei}(4)-\log (2) & \text{Ei}(6)-\log (2) & \text{Ei}(8)-\log (2) \\  \text{Ei}(3)-\log (3) & \text{Ei}(6)-\log (3) & \text{Ei}(9)-\log (3) & \text{Ei}(12)-\log (3) \\  \text{Ei}(4)-\log (4) & \text{Ei}(8)-\log (4) & \text{Ei}(12)-\log (4) & \text{Ei}(16)-\log (4) \end{array} \right)$$ I was not entirely clear in the use of integration indices $n$ and $k$.

One way to illustrate this is to plot a matrix such that if the column index (1,2,3,...) divides the row index (1,2,3,...) then a black square is drawn at that column and row index intersection, like this: As a matrix this has the definition in Mathematica: MatrixForm[Table[Table[If[Mod[n, k] == 0, 1, 0 ], {k, 1, 12}], {n, 1, 12}]] which gives the table below: $$\small \left( \begin{array}{cccccccccccc}  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\  1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{array} \right)$$ The number of divisors of n, also called tau, is the row sums of this matrix and starts: 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 4, 3, 4, 2, 6 ... So at a row equal to a prime number there are only two black dots and the row sums in the above matrix are equal to 2. To find the ordinary generating function of the number of divisors of n we consider table $a$ times $b$, or row index times column index: MatrixForm[Table[Table[a*b, {b, 1, 12}], {a, 1, 12}]] $$\small \left( \begin{array}{cccccccccccc}  1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\  2 & 4 & 6 & 8 & 10 & 12 & 14 & 16 & 18 & 20 & 22 & 24 \\  3 & 6 & 9 & 12 & 15 & 18 & 21 & 24 & 27 & 30 & 33 & 36 \\  4 & 8 & 12 & 16 & 20 & 24 & 28 & 32 & 36 & 40 & 44 & 48 \\  5 & 10 & 15 & 20 & 25 & 30 & 35 & 40 & 45 & 50 & 55 & 60 \\  6 & 12 & 18 & 24 & 30 & 36 & 42 & 48 & 54 & 60 & 66 & 72 \\  7 & 14 & 21 & 28 & 35 & 42 & 49 & 56 & 63 & 70 & 77 & 84 \\  8 & 16 & 24 & 32 & 40 & 48 & 56 & 64 & 72 & 80 & 88 & 96 \\  9 & 18 & 27 & 36 & 45 & 54 & 63 & 72 & 81 & 90 & 99 & 108 \\  10 & 20 & 30 & 40 & 50 & 60 & 70 & 80 & 90 & 100 & 110 & 120 \\  11 & 22 & 33 & 44 & 55 & 66 & 77 & 88 & 99 & 110 & 121 & 132 \\  12 & 24 & 36 & 48 & 60 & 72 & 84 & 96 & 108 & 120 & 132 & 144 \end{array} \right)$$ By stretching out this table in the downward direction we get this table: MatrixForm[Table[Table[If[Mod[a, b] == 0, a, 0], {b, 1, 12}], {a, 1, 12}]] $$\small \left( \begin{array}{cccccccccccc}  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  2 & 2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  3 & 0 & 3 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  4 & 4 & 0 & 4 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  5 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 5 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  6 & 6 & 6 & 0 & 0 & 6 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  7 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 7 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  8 & 8 & 0 & 8 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 8 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  9 & 0 & 9 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 9 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  10 & 10 & 0 & 0 & 10 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 10 & 0 & 0 \\  11 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 11 & 0 \\  12 & 12 & 12 & 12 & 0 & 12 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 12 \end{array} \right)$$ This looks very much like the divisorplot at the beginning. To find the generating function for the number of divisors of $n$ we then introduce the variable $x$ like this: Clear[x] MatrixForm[  Table[Table[If[Mod[a, b] == 0, x^a, 0], {b, 1, 12}], {a, 1, 12}]] $$\small \left( \begin{array}{cccccccccccc}  x & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  x^2 & x^2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  x^3 & 0 & x^3 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  x^4 & x^4 & 0 & x^4 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  x^5 & 0 & 0 & 0 & x^5 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  x^6 & x^6 & x^6 & 0 & 0 & x^6 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  x^7 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & x^7 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  x^8 & x^8 & 0 & x^8 & 0 & 0 & 0 & x^8 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  x^9 & 0 & x^9 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & x^9 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  x^{10} & x^{10} & 0 & 0 & x^{10} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & x^{10} & 0 & 0 \\  x^{11} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & x^{11} & 0 \\  x^{12} & x^{12} & x^{12} & x^{12} & 0 & x^{12} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & x^{12} \end{array} \right)$$ The generating function for the number of divisors of $n$ is then the infinite double sum which is the sum of the infinite matrix above: $$\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} d(n)x^{n} = \sum\limits_{a=1}^{\infty} \sum\limits_{b=1}^{\infty} x^{a b}$$  $$= 1\, x^{1} + 2\, x^{2} +  2\, x^{3} +  3\, x^{4} +  2\, x^{5} +  4\, x^{6} +  2\, x^{7} +  4\, x^{8} +  3\, x^{9} +  4\, x^{10} + 2\, x^{11} +  6\, x^{12} +  ...$$ where $d(n)$ = the number of divisors of $n$ A sum $\sum$ is a sum of distances - usually under a function, while an integral $\int$ is a sum of areas under a function, and a double integral $\int \int$ is a sum of volumes and so on... Often in mathematics one wants to compare a sum to an integral, or at least so I have heard. In this case we have a double sum: $$\sum\limits_{a=1}^{\infty} \sum\limits_{b=1}^{\infty} x^{a b}$$ Considering the double integral instead we have: $$\int\limits_{a=1}^{\infty} \int\limits_{b=1}^{\infty} x^{a b}$$ As suggested by Chris's wise sister in the chat room about two weeks ago, the similar triple integral evaluates faster at $x=\frac{1}{e}$: According to Mathematica: Integrate[Integrate[1/Exp[1]^(a*b), {a, 1, Infinity}], {b, 1, Infinity}] the double integral then evaluates to: $$\int\limits_{a=1}^{\infty} \int\limits_{b=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{e^{a b}}=-\text{Ei}(-1)$$ Or as Mathematica calls it, the exponential integral. Reading about the exponential integral in Wikipedia that passing a logarithm as argument to it one gets the logarithmic integral and remembering that the logarithmic integral has to do with the prime number theorem, I did some experimenting in Mathematica with the program: Monitor[MatrixForm[   Table[Table[     Integrate[       Integrate[Exp[a*b], {a, k, Infinity},         GenerateConditions -> False], {b, 0, n},        GenerateConditions -> False] -       Integrate[       Integrate[Exp[a*b], {a, 0, n}, GenerateConditions -> False], {b,         k, Infinity}, GenerateConditions -> False], {n, 1, 4}], {k, 0,      4}]], k] and came to the conclusion that for $n \gt 0$ and $k \geq 0$, this appears to be an identity: $$\gamma = \int_0^n \left(\int_k^{\infty } e^{a b} \, da\right) \, db-\int_k^{\infty } \left(\int_0^n e^{a b} \, da\right) \, db$$ where $\gamma$ = Euler-Mascheroni constant , approximately equal to 0.57721566490153286060651209... My question is: Why is this identity true? I also noted that: For $k \lt 0$ and $n \lt 0$, it appears to be true that: $$\gamma = \Re(\int_0^n \left(\int_k^{\infty } e^{a b} \, da\right) \, db-\int_k^{\infty } \left(\int_0^n e^{a b} \, da\right) \, db)$$ $$-\pi = \Im(\int_0^n \left(\int_k^{\infty } e^{a b} \, da\right) \, db-\int_k^{\infty } \left(\int_0^n e^{a b} \, da\right) \, db)$$ But this is probably less interesting.

8,Deriving a formula for the amount of time you should study for multiple tests,Deriving a formula for the amount of time you should study for multiple tests,,"Just a bit of procrastination here but at the bus stop I was wondering how should I study before multiple tests given the percentage of the grade each one was worth, the days until each test and the amount of hours you want to study that day. Here's my attempt I have come to the conclusion that it would be an inverse relationship between the percentage of time you should allocate (S) and the time until the test (t). Multiplied this by the grade percentage the test was worth (G). $$S\propto \frac{G}{t}$$ Given that you have multiple tests and 8 hours (S=8) a day to study I sum the above relationship to and equate the hours to yield the following: (k= 8/sum) $$8=k \sum^n_{i=1} S_i$$ $$8=k \sum^n_{i=1} \frac{G_i}{t_i}$$ For instance let's say that I have 6 tests: English( $G_1=0.25$ , $t=58$ days) Maths Methods( $G_2=0.5$ , $t=60$ days), Specialist Maths( $G_3=0.5$ , $t=65$ days), Chemistry( $G_4=0.5$ , $t=72$ days), Modern History( $G_5=0.25$ , $t=74$ days), Physics( $G_6=0.5$ , $t=76$ days). Today I have 8 hours to study (more like 7 after I'm done with this), using my formula I can calculate how long I should study for each test today ( $S_i$ ). $$8=k \sum^n_{i=1} \frac{G_i}{t_i}= k\Big(\frac{G_1}{D_1}+\frac{G_2}{D_2}+\frac{G_3}{D_3}+\frac{G_4}{t_4}+\frac{G_5}{t_5}+\frac{G_6}{t_6}\Big)$$ $$=k\Big(\frac{0.25}{58}+\frac{0.5}{60}+\frac{0.5}{65}+\frac{0.5}{72}+\frac{0.25}{74}+\frac{0.5}{76}\Big)$$ $k\approx 214.84$ Therefore, English $S= 0.93$ hours Maths Methods $S= 1.79$ hours Specialist Maths $S= 1.65$ hours Chemistry $S= 1.49$ hours Modern History $S= 0.73$ hours Physics $S= 1.41$ hours Now given that the time approaches the day before the first test (English) I want to just study the content of the first test so I am ready for the test. So let $t_1=1$ $$8=k\Big(\frac{0.25}{1}+\frac{0.5}{3}+\frac{0.5}{8}+\frac{0.5}{15}+\frac{0.25}{17}+\frac{0.5}{19}\Big)$$ $k\approx 14.45 $ Therefore English $S= 3.61$ hours Maths Methods $S= 2.4$ hours Specialist Maths $S=0.90 $ hours Chemistry $S= 0.48$ hours Modern History $S= 0.21$ hours Physics $S= 0.38$ hours This is where my model somewhat fails as I want most of the day to be studying the most urgent subject. If the test dates were more 'spaced out' or English had a 50% of the marks test then I would spend most of the day before the test studying the subject. Can any of you 'test anxious' mathematicians suggest any improvements of this crude model (I am a high school student)? I was thinking about throwing in some differential equations ( $\frac{\partial S}{\partial t_1} )$ but I'm not smart enough for that yet.

This isn't a serious model and there is plenty of space to play with. How could I extend and improve this model using differential equations? This is the second bounty","Just a bit of procrastination here but at the bus stop I was wondering how should I study before multiple tests given the percentage of the grade each one was worth, the days until each test and the amount of hours you want to study that day. Here's my attempt I have come to the conclusion that it would be an inverse relationship between the percentage of time you should allocate (S) and the time until the test (t). Multiplied this by the grade percentage the test was worth (G). Given that you have multiple tests and 8 hours (S=8) a day to study I sum the above relationship to and equate the hours to yield the following: (k= 8/sum) For instance let's say that I have 6 tests: English( , days) Maths Methods( , days), Specialist Maths( , days), Chemistry( , days), Modern History( , days), Physics( , days). Today I have 8 hours to study (more like 7 after I'm done with this), using my formula I can calculate how long I should study for each test today ( ). Therefore, English hours Maths Methods hours Specialist Maths hours Chemistry hours Modern History hours Physics hours Now given that the time approaches the day before the first test (English) I want to just study the content of the first test so I am ready for the test. So let Therefore English hours Maths Methods hours Specialist Maths hours Chemistry hours Modern History hours Physics hours This is where my model somewhat fails as I want most of the day to be studying the most urgent subject. If the test dates were more 'spaced out' or English had a 50% of the marks test then I would spend most of the day before the test studying the subject. Can any of you 'test anxious' mathematicians suggest any improvements of this crude model (I am a high school student)? I was thinking about throwing in some differential equations ( but I'm not smart enough for that yet. Thank you Edit: I have more of a think about it and have come up with the following conditions.

Proceeding with $\beta = 0$ gives us $$\omega = \frac{3B}{2M}$$ which gives me a maximal $$Q = \frac{M}{2^{2/3} 3^{1/3} B^{1/3}}$$. However, I am not sure if this answer/my method is correct, nor how to incorporate the inequality constraint that $g_0$ is smaller than some fixed value. I can get a measurement for maximal $Q$ via a different method, which provides me with the correct powers/dimension, but the prefactors (in particular the $2^{2/3}$) are incorrect. Any pointers on how to answer this type of question? How to incorporate the inequality? Or if indeed my method is correct. EDIT To show why I select $\beta = 0$ as the maximal case. Consider the plot of $Q$ against $\omega$. If we input some reasonable (physically sound) values for $M = 4.5$ and $B = 2$ we have So we can see that $Q$ has a maximal value. However, plotting $\beta$ against $\omega$ for the same values of $M,B$ shows us that $\beta$ gives a negative value at this maximal value, which is unphsyical.

I can get a measurement for maximal $Q$ via a different method, which provides me with the correct powers/dimension, but the prefactors (in particular the $2^{2/3}$) are incorrect. Any pointers on how to answer this type of question? How to incorporate the inequality? Or if indeed my method is correct. EDIT To show why I select $\beta = 0$ as the maximal case. Consider the plot of $Q$ against $\omega$. If we input some reasonable (physically sound) values for $M = 4.5$ and $B = 2$ we have So we can see that $Q$ has a maximal value. However, plotting $\beta$ against $\omega$ for the same values of $M,B$ shows us that $\beta$ gives a negative value at this maximal value, which is unphsyical. So the maximal $Q$ goes with $\beta = 0$.",,"['calculus', 'calculus-of-variations']"

24,Differentiating $y=x^{2}$,Differentiating,y=x^{2},"I am reading in a book about differentiating, but I am confused with one of the steps he takes.  We start with: $$\begin{align} y &= x^{2} \\ y + \mathrm{d}y &= (x + \mathrm{d}x)^2 \\ y + \mathrm{d}y &= x^2 + x\mathrm{d}x + x\mathrm{d}x + (\mathrm{d}x^2) \end{align}$$ Now the author simplifies this to: $$y + dy = x^2 + 2x\mathrm{d}x + (\mathrm{d}x^2)$$ I dislike how the middle term is simplified to $2x\mathrm{d}x$ instead of $2(x\mathrm{d}x)$ , as I feel like it is more intuitive on what is going.  As in, $2$ of the term $x\mathrm{d}x$ , instead of $2x\mathrm{d}x$ .  But I fear writing it as $2(x\mathrm{d}x)$ may result in an incorrect distributive property. Next, he omits the $(\mathrm{d}x^2)$ : $y + \mathrm{d}y = x^2 + 2x \mathrm{d}x$ . Subtract the original $y = x^2.$ : $$\mathrm{d}y = 2x \mathrm{d}x.$$ Now here is where I get confused: $$\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x} = 2x.$$ How can he just divide both sides by $\mathrm{d}x$ !?  If the original term was $2$ of $x\mathrm{d}x$ , wouldn't it have to be written out as $2x * 2\mathrm{d}x$ , and thus divide both sides by $2\mathrm{d}x$ instead?

31,Is there a simple geometric proof of why two simple harmonic oscillators draw a circle?,Is there a simple geometric proof of why two simple harmonic oscillators draw a circle?,,"We all know that a circle can be drawn with the trigonometric functions $x=\cos(t),  y=\sin(t)$ . If we define the sine and cosine functions in terms of triangles (like we do in high school), then this is quite obvious. But then later on in our education, we learn that the solution to a simple harmonic oscillator is the sine function. A weight on an undamped spring goes back and forth following a sine wave over time, and that this is the intuition behind a lot of wave motion (like sound waves). However, it's not generally taught why the sine wave solution to simple harmonic motion is the same function as the sine wave as defined by triangles or circles. Or in other words, when you take two harmonic oscillators and plot their outputs as $x=\cos(t),  y=\sin(t)$ , why should they make a perfect circle? More specifically: it's intuitive enough that they must form a shape that makes a full loop of some kind. But why does it happen to be a perfect circle , as opposed to an alternative shape like a larger ""squircle"", or something smaller similar to a rhombus with rounded corners? After doing a bit of research, the best answer I've found is that if you independently derive the Taylor series for each of: $\sin(t)$ as defined by simple harmonic oscillator (as the negative of its second derivative) $\sin(x)$ as defined trigonometrically (as the opposite side of a right triangle over the hypoteneuse) Then you discover they're the same Taylor series and therefore the same function and therefore simple harmonic oscillators can be used to draw a circle. But I'm wondering two things. First, is there some kind of more intuitive, direct, ideally geometric explanation? Resorting to Taylor series certainly works as a formal proof, but it doesn't build any kind of intuitive understanding. And for something so foundational to math and engineering as circles and sine waves, it seems like there should be a more obvious link. And second, if there is no such intuitive explanation and we're forced to resort to the Taylor series equivalence, is there an easy yet rigorous way to derive that that doesn't involve mixing up the two origins/definitions of the sine function to do so? E.g. every example I can find of deriving the Taylor series expansion of a simple harmonic oscillator involves using a trigonometric identity at some point, e.g. to show that the derivative of sine is cosine. But this defeats the whole purpose because it assumes what I'm trying to prove -- that the simple harmonic oscillator sine wave is the same as the trigonometric sine wave in the first place.","We all know that a circle can be drawn with the trigonometric functions .

94,Sigmoid function with fixed bounds and variable steepness [partially solved],Sigmoid function with fixed bounds and variable steepness [partially solved],,"(see edits below with attempts made in the meanwhile after posting the question) Problem I need to modify a sigmoid function for an AI application, but cannot figure out the correct math. Given a variable $x \in [0,1]$ , a function $f(x)$ should satisfy the following requirements (pardon the math-noobiness of my expression): a) the values of $f(x)$ should be costrained to $[0,1]$ b) when $x=0$ then $f(x)=0$ , and when $x=1$ then $f(x)=1$ c) $f(x)$ should follow a sigmoid or ""S-curve"" shape within these bounds, with some variable changing the ""steepness"" of the curve. I used a different function earlier, corresponding to (0), illustrated below on the left: (0) $f(x) = x^{(z+0.5)^{-b}}$ , where $b=2$ with $z \in [0,1]$ controlling the curve What is a function that would satisfy these requirements, i.e. do the same thing as equation (0) but with an S-curve $?_{(I\hspace{1mm} hope\hspace{1mm} this\hspace{1mm} makes\hspace{1mm} at\hspace{1mm} least\hspace{1mm} some \hspace{1mm}mathematical\hspace{1mm} sense...)}$ Attempt 1 I tried to accomplish something similar with a logistic function (by varying the $x_0$ value; cf. equation (1) and the right side plot above) (1) $f(x) = \dfrac{1}{1 + e^{-b(x-(1-x_0))}}$ , where $b=10$ , $x_0 \in [0,1]$ ...so that $x_0 = 0.5$ yields some central or average curve (like the linear growth line on the leftmost plot), and values around it rise or lower the steepness. Shortcoming: the ""ends"" of the curve where $x=\{0,1\}$ won't reach the required values of 0 and 1 respectively. I don't want to force it arbitrarily with an if-else , it should come naturally from the properties of an equation (and as such form nice curves). Attempt 2 This sort of does the trick, now the ends smootly reach 0 and 1 for all values of $x_0$ : (2) $f(x) = \Bigg(\bigg( \dfrac{1}{1 + e^{-b(x-(1-x_0))}}\bigg)x\Bigg)^{1-x} $ Only problem, the effect is not ""symmetrical"", when comparing high and low values. Observe the values for $f(x)$ with $x_0 = [0,1]$ ; $b=10$ (left side plot below). The curve steepness varies more among lower $x_0$ values (yellow,red) than amoing higher values (pink); also, changing $x_0$ also has noticably more effect in lower values of $x$ than its higher values.
