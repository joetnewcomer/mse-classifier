0,All open subsets of the spectrum of a number field are principal,All open subsets of the spectrum of a number field are principal,,"Let $K$ be a number field, $\mathcal{O}_k$ its ring of integers, $\operatorname{Cl}(K)$ its class group and $h_K = \lvert \operatorname{Cl}(K)\rvert$ its class number. Let $X = \operatorname{Spec}(\mathcal{O}_K)$ and let $U\subseteq X$ be an open subset of $X$. Apparently ( ex.3.19 Liu ), using the fact that $h_K$ is finite it can be shown that $U$ is in fact a principal open subset of $X$ i.e. $U = D(\alpha) = \left\{[P]\in X: \alpha\notin P\right\}$ for some element $\alpha\in\mathcal{O}_K$. I've run into a possibly trivial roadblock in my attempt at a proof and would like it if someone could fix it for me or tell me where I went wrong. I've written out my attempt in full here: Proof : Since $U$ is open we have $U = X\backslash V(I)$ for some ideal $I\subseteq \mathcal{O}_K$. Since $\mathcal{O}_K$ is a Dedekind domain we have $I = P_1\dots P_n$ for unique prime (hence maximal) ideals $P_i\in\mathcal{O}_K$. If $U=X$ then we can take $U = D(1)$. Therefore suppose $U\neq X$; we have $V(I) = \bigcup_{i=1}^n V(P_i)$. Since each $P_i$ is maximal, the point $x_i = [P_i]\in X$ is closed. Hence $U$ is the complement in $X$ of the finite set $\left\{x_1, \dots, x_n\right\}$. Now we want to find an element $\alpha\in\mathcal{O}_K$ such $U = D(\alpha)$. This element $\alpha$, if it exists, has to be contained in each $P_i$ since if $\alpha\notin P_i$ for some $i$ then $x_i = [P_i]\in D(\alpha)$, but $U = D(\alpha) = X\backslash\left\{x_1, \dots, x_n\right\}$. Therefore we need an element $\alpha\in J:= \bigcap_{i=1}^n P_i$. Since $I\subseteq J$ it would be nice to pick an element of $I$ for this $\alpha$, but since $I$ may not be principal there is no natural choice. Instead, note that since the class number $h_K$ is finite there exists an integer $m\leq h_K$ such that $I^m$ is a principal ideal, say $I^m = (\alpha)$. Now $I^m \subseteq I\subseteq J$ and therefore $D(\alpha)\subseteq U$. Now take a point $x = [Q]\in U$ for some prime ideal $Q\subseteq\mathcal{O}_K$; then $x\notin V(I)$ so $Q\nsupseteq I$. Therefore there exists $\beta\in I$ such that $\beta\notin Q$. The aim of the game is to show $\alpha\notin Q$. Suppose $\alpha\in Q$; then it follows that since $I^m = (\alpha)$ there exists $\gamma\in I^{m-1}, \delta\in\mathcal{O}_K$ such that $\beta \gamma =\alpha\delta$. By the assumption on $\alpha$ we have $\beta\gamma\in Q$, and by assumption on $\beta$ we know $\gamma\in Q$. I want to use this to derive a contradiction because ultimately I wanted to show this would imply $\beta\in Q$, and thus the assumption $\alpha\in Q$ was wrong. But I can't figure out what to do here.

2,Extension of projection from a point to a Blow Up,Extension of projection from a point to a Blow Up,,"I feel like there's something obvious I'm missing here, and I'm not looking for a whole answer, but rather just a pointer in the right direction. Suppose you have the projection from a point $\mathbb{P}^n \backslash \{P\} \to \mathbb{P}^{n-1}$, where $P = (0:...:0:1)$. This is not defined at $P$, but the claim is that it extends to a morphism from $B_P(\mathbb{P}^n)$ (blow up at $P$) to $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$. I'm trying to figure out exactly how to define this morphism. Since the blow up just replaces $P$ with a copy of $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$, it seems like the most natural morphism to consider should just be the identity, specifically from $\{P\} \times \mathbb{P}^{n-1} \to \mathbb{P}^{n-1}$. This seems to make sense; the definition of morphism $\varphi$ between quasi-projective varieties $X \to Y$ that I have is a Zariski continuous map such that if $f$ is regular on an open set $U \subset Y$, then $f \circ \varphi$ is regular on $\varphi^{-1}(U)$, and as far as I can tell, this new map should satisfy these conditions, since I'm basically giving two morphisms on two disjoint parts of the blow-up.

Hence $\mathcal{F_1^\bullet}$ is a coherent sheaf of ideal on $X$. By Proposition II 5.9 on Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometry (Page 116), $\mathcal{F_1^\bullet}$ is the ideal sheaf of a closed subscheme.

Problem: Show that $\dim X \times_Z Y = \dim X + \dim Y - \dim Z$, where    $X \times_Z Y$ is the fiber product $\left\{(a,b)\in X\times Y: \, f(a)=g(b)\right\}$. My proof when $Z=\mathbb{A}^d$: The map $f$ is given by a $d$-tuple $(f_1,\dots,f_d)$ of elements of $A(X)$ and similarly $g=(g_1,\dots,g_d)$, where $g_i \in A(Y)$.  Since $f$ is surjective, we have an injective ring homomorphism $A(Z)=k[z_1,\dots,z_d] \hookrightarrow A(X)$, given by $z_i \mapsto f_i$. Thus we can write $A(X)=k[f_1,\dots,f_d,x_1,\dots,x_s]$, where $f_1,\dots,f_d$ are algebraically independent over $k$. Similarly, we can write $A(Y)=k[g_1,\dots,g_d,y_1,\dots,y_t]$, where $g_1,\dots,g_d$ are algebraically independent over $k$.

Similarly for $g=(g_1,\dots,g_d,\dots,g_\ell)$. Now, to obtain $A(X \times_Z Y)$ we have to take the quotient of $A(X \times Y)$ by all $f_i-g_i$.

Here, the idea is for $\mathbb{C}^M$ to represent the space of all sets of polynomials $\{f_i\}$ (via their coefficients) and $\mathbb{P}^n$ the values for the $x_i$ (after homogenizing maybe). Then, define $W$ as the pairs $\big( \{f_i\},{\bf x}\big)$ such that $f_i({\bf x})=0\ \forall i$. It is easy to see that $W$ is indeed a variety (its equation is just the (polynomial) evaluation of the $f_i$'s at ${\bf x}$). The theorem states that the image $\pi(W)$ (which corresponds to $f_i$'s having at least one non-trivial common root) is again a variety; that is, it is cut by a polynomial equation in $\mathbb{C}^M$, the space of polynomials, parametrised by their coefficients. _____________________________________________________________________ A polynomial $f$ on $n$ variables $x_i$ and of degree $r$ is reducible, that is can be written as a product $$f(x_1,\cdots,x_n)=g(x_1,\cdots,x_n)\cdot h(x_1,\cdots,x_n)$$ of polynomials $h$ and $g$ of smaller degree. Proof : I am not aware of any name for the resulting polynomial(s) on the coefficients of $f$.

The idea is to consider the varieties $W_i$ that are formed by all (homogeneous) polynomials of degree $i$. Then, there is a map $W_i\times W_{n-i}\rightarrow W_n$ where we send $(f,g)$ to their product $f\cdot g$. This map is clearly a morphism (since multiplication of polynomials is a polynomial map on the coefficients). The image then, corresponds to polynomials that can be written as a product of a degree $i$ and a degree $n-i$ polynomials. The aforementioned corollary implies then that the image is closed, hence given by polynomial equations (for details see section $\S$14.1 in Eisenbud's very beautiful Commutative Algebra with a view to a kill ). _____________________________________________________________________ A system of polynomials $(f_1,\cdots,f_n)$ is algebraically dependent, that is, there exists a polynomial $h\in \mathbb{C}[z_1,\cdots,z_n]$ such  that $$h(f_1,\cdots,f_n)=0$$ Proof : The proof for this is the celebrated Jacobian criterion which states that the $f_i$ are algebraically dependent if and only if $$\operatorname{Jac}(f_1,\cdots,f_n)=0$$ where, of course, the jacobian polynomial being $0$ translates to certain polynomials on the coefficients of the $f_i$'s being $0$.

First notice that being a h.s.o.p. means that the algebra $\displaystyle \mathbb{C}[x_1,\cdots,x_n]/(f_1,\cdots,f_n)$ is finite dimensional (as a vector space). Therefore, a tuple $(f_1,\cdots,f_n)$ forms a h.s.o.p. iff all but finitely many of the monomials $x_1^{a_1}\cdots x_n^{a_n}$ are in the ideal generated by the $f_i$'s. For that matter, it is enough for the ideal $(f_1,\cdots,f_n)$ to contain all the monomials of some degree $N$.
