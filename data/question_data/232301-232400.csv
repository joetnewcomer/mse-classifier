I would like to get a solid understanding of its meaning outside of the numbers and its relation to the interval (which makes sense). In thinking about ""points"" like in a graph, trying to get an intuition for how points can have that same sort of feature as the interval, where $0 < x < 1$ sort of thing, where x can be anything between $0$ and $1$ except $0$ and $1$. It's hard to imagine a set of points that doesn't have a boundary, because it's a set of points. It seems part of the definition of the set. Otherwise it seems you would have to say the set has 2 types of points, the boundary points and non-boundary points, and so: open set = boundary points + non-boundary points - access rights on boundary points. closed set = boundary points + non-boundary points + access rights on boundary points. The questions are: Intuition for an open set in a topology of points that doesn't use numbers or the cyclic definition of open sets as the elements composing a topology. If discrete topologies (like graphs where vertices are connected by edges) can have open sets, or if it's just a continuous/infinity thing. Why it's necessary to define a set as open .",,"['general-topology', 'elementary-set-theory']"
