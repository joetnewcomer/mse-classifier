47,Numbers of $2N$ digits that are divisible by the numbers formed by the first and last $N$ digits,Numbers of  digits that are divisible by the numbers formed by the first and last  digits,2N N,"Here's the problem statement: Tyomitch calls the number with $2N$ digits (without leading zeroes) ""interesting"", if it's divisible by both the number formed from its first $N$ digits and the number formed from its last $N$ digits. For example, $1020$ is ""interesting"" (divisible by $10$ and $20$ ) and 2005 is not. Tyomitch wants to know how many ""interesting"" 2N-digit numbers exist. You are to help him. Despite being a programming problem, it actually has a closed form formula solution, I tried to derive it, but something went wrong since it gives wrong answers for considerably small N. The solution: Let $m = a\cdot 10^n + b$ , where $n$ is $n$ mentioned in the problem statement and $a, b, n, m \in \mathbb{N}$ . $a$ and $b$ are gonna play the role of those two numbers of which we are supposed to divide i.e. $a \mid m$ and $b \mid m$ . So we also need to put some constraints on them, like we can't have leading zeros in number $m$ and we also can't have zeros in $a$ or $b$ since we would have divided by zero. So, firstly let do these constraints: $$10^{n - 1} \leq a < 10^n$$ $$1 \leq b < 10^n$$ Now let's do some observations: $$a \mid m \Leftrightarrow m = a \cdot v$$ $$m = a \cdot 10^n + b \Leftrightarrow m - a \cdot 10^n = b \Leftrightarrow a \cdot v - a \cdot 10^n = b\Leftrightarrow a(v - 10^n) = b  \Leftrightarrow a \mid b$$ $$a \mid b \Leftrightarrow b \geq a$$ Then we have more tight constraints for b: $$10^{n - 1} \leq a \leq b < 10^n$$ $$a \mid b \Leftrightarrow b = a \cdot k, \text{ where } k < 10$$ Back to the original equation: $$m = a \cdot 10^n + b \Leftrightarrow \frac{m}{b} = \frac{a \cdot 10^n + b}{b}  \Leftrightarrow \frac{m}{b} = \frac{a \cdot 10^n}{a\cdot k} + 1 \Leftrightarrow \frac{m}{b} = \frac{10^n}{k} + 1 \Leftrightarrow k \mid 10^n \text{  since LHS is integer}$$ There are 3 corner cases: $$n = 1, k \in \{1, 2, 5\}$$ $$n = 2, k \in \{1, 2, 4, 5\}$$ $$n \geq 3, k \in \{1, 2, 4, 5, 8\}$$ I'll be looking only to the third case since I'm looking for general formula. Lemma: Amount of multiples of $k$ on $[1; n]$ segment is equal to $\lfloor\frac{n}{k}\rfloor$ Let's denote $p_{k}(n)$ = $\lfloor\frac{n}{k}\rfloor$ i.e. amount of multiples of $k$ on $[1; n]$ and $p_k(a, b)$ - amount of multiples of $k$ on $[a; b]$ i.e. $p_k(a, b) = p_k(b) - p_k(a - 1)$ . Since we have those constraints: $$10^{n - 1} \leq a < 10^n$$ $$10^{n - 1} \leq b < 10^n$$ $$10^{n - 1} \leq a\cdot k < 10^n$$ We need to count amount of multiples of $k$ in $[10^{n - 1}, 10^{n} - 1]$ segment for all possible $k$ i.e. $k \in \{1, 2, 4, 5, 8\}$ and that's gonna be the answer. $p_k(10^{n - 1} - 1, 10^{n} - 1) \Leftrightarrow p_k(10^{n - 1}, 10^n)$ for $n \geq 4$ , since $10^n$ adds one mupltiply for each possible divisor $(1, 2, 4, 5, 8)$ . Same goes for $10^{n - 1}$ negating the added divisors. Therefore the answer for amount of ""interesting"" numbers for given $n$ is: $$p_1(10^{n - 1}, 10^n) + p_2(10^{n - 1}, 10^n) + p_4(10^{n - 1}, 10^n) + p_5(10^{n - 1}, 10^n) + p_8(10^{n - 1}, 10^n) = $$ $$= \frac{1}{1}10^n - \frac{1}{1} 10^{n - 1} + \frac{1}{2}10^n - \frac{1}{2} 10^{n - 1} + \frac{1}{4}10^n - \frac{1}{4} 10^{n - 1}+ \frac{1}{5}10^n - \frac{1}{5} 10^{n - 1}+ \frac{1}{8}10^n - \frac{1}{8} 10^{n - 1} = $$ $$= 10^n\bigg(\frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{8} - \frac{1}{10}\bigg(\frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{8}\bigg)\bigg) =$$ $$= \frac{747}{400}\cdot 10^n = 1.8675 \cdot 10^n$$ Which is a not correct formula. You may ask why is it wrong? I have bruteforced this problem for small $n$ up to $4$ . For $n = 3$ I should have had $1575$ and for $n = 4 - 15750$ . Which makes formula more like $1.575 \cdot 10^n$ . And I wonder what and where went wrong? P.S. I remembered my yesterday idea when I was trying to figure out $n = 2$ case: As before I need to count amount of all possible $k \in \{1, 2, 4, 5\}$ . $$10 \leq a\cdot k < 100$$ The ans is (by division I mean floored division): $\frac{99}{1} + \frac{99}{2} + \frac{99}{4} + \frac{99}{5} - (\frac{9}{1} + \frac{9}{1} + \frac{9}{1} + \frac{9}{1}) = 99 + 49 + 24 + 19 - 36 = 155$ , which IS a correct answer for $n = 2$ . I completely don't remember how I derived this equation, though now I think it was a complete fluke idea which led me to right answer. What's more interesting if I do the same for general formula equation it is indeed leading to the right answer too. $$10^n\bigg(\frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{8} - \frac{1}{10}\bigg(\frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{1}\bigg)\bigg) =$$ $$= \frac{63}{40}\cdot 10^n = 1.575 \cdot 10^n$$ But still I want to know what went wrong with my initial solution since I don't know at all how to derive the correct formula.","Here's the problem statement: Tyomitch calls the number with digits (without leading zeroes) ""interesting"", if it's divisible by both the number formed from its first digits and the number formed from its last digits.

The president of the country had ordered to build several new towns and roads so that you could still get from any town to any by roads. As it turned out, there are now $100$ roads that do not share ends pairwise, connecting newly built towns to the older ones. Proof that you can close a number of roads so that there would be left only a single path between each two of the towns, and also that there would be no less than $100$ towns that would have only a single road leading out from them. I came up with the following: First, let's translate the problem to the language of graph theory. Obviously, the towns and roads here are vertices and edges of an undirected graph, let's call it $G$ . The ""get from any town to any"" condition means that $G$ is connected. Next, we make a union with an nonempty set of vertices and edges $U$ such that $G \cup U$ is connected. This graph has $100$ edges each without a common end with one another, and each of those edges connects a vertex from $V(G)$ to a vertex from $V(U)$ . What needs to be proven is that this graph has a spanning tree (given by the ""single unique path"" condition) that has at least $100$ leaves. Such a tree does exist since the graph is connected. Second, I tried to consider the $100$ edges we have (let's call this edge set $F$ ). They don't have any ends in common, and each edge is incidental to a vertex $x \in V(G)$ of an arbitrary degree $\geq2$ and a vertex $y \in V(U)$ that is either a leaf vertex (deg. of $1$ ) or not. If it is a leaf vertex, then we don't need to do anything with it and we just add it to the number of needed leaves for the proof. If it isn't (i.e it has more than one vertex adjacent to it), then we consider two cases: a) $y$ has other leaves adjacent to it; b) it doesn't and each other adjacent vertex is of degree $\geq2$ . In the first case, we have one or more leaves found, and in the second case we remove all edges adjacent to $y$ except $xy \in F$ and now it is a leaf itself. Thus, we should be able to attain at least $100$ leaves. The final wanted condition is that we need the resulting graph to be a spanning tree. I'm not sure if I can just say that next we arbitrarily delete edges to attain it (would that be rigorous enough?), or if we need to construct a Trémaux tree or something along those lines. So, I would like to know if the first part of the solution (about edges and leaves) is sufficient enough for a proof and if it is correct at all, and would also like some help on the second part (about a spanning tree).","I have the following graph theory problem: In a country there are pairs of towns connected by roads in such a way that you can get from any town to any by those roads.

Let $S_m$ be the symmetric group on $[|1..m|]$ . For every $k\in[|1,n|]$ , take a permutation $\sigma_k\in S_m$ satisfying $\sigma_k(k)=k+n$ , and consider the subgroup $G$ of $S_m$ generated by $\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_n$ . Question: Must $G$ always contain a permutation $\sigma$ such that $\sigma A \cap A = \emptyset$ ? My thoughts : I can show that the answer is yes for $n=2$ . Suppose by contradiction that $\sigma A\cap A \neq \emptyset$ for every $\sigma \in G$ . I will denote $\sigma_1$ by $a$ and $\sigma_2$ by $b$ , so that $a(1)=3$ and $b(2)=4$ . From $aA\cap A \neq \emptyset$ , we deduce $a(2)\in\lbrace 1,2 \rbrace$ , and similarly $bA\cap A \neq \emptyset$ forces $b(1)\in\lbrace 1,2 \rbrace$ . Suppose first that $a(2)=1$ . Then $a^2(2)=3$ , so from $a^2A\cap A \neq \emptyset$ we deduce $a^2(1)\in\lbrace 1,2\rbrace$ , or $a(3)\in\lbrace 1,2\rbrace$ , which forces $a(3)=2$ . We then have $ab(2)=a(4)\not\in \lbrace 1,2\rbrace$ , so from $abA\cap A \neq \emptyset$ we deduce $ab(1)\in\lbrace 1,2\rbrace$ , and hence $b(1) \in a^{-1}\lbrace 1,2\rbrace=\lbrace 2,3\rbrace$ . But we already know that $b(1)\in\lbrace 1,2 \rbrace$ , so $b(1)=2$ . Next, we have $ba^{-1}(1)=4$ , so $ba^{-1}(2)\in \lbrace 1,2\rbrace$ , and hence $b(3)=1$ .

You plan to do this over the course of $g$ rounds, where in each round, the group divides itself into $g$ groups of $p$ people, and each group plays a game. The goal is to do this in such that way that Everyone plays every game exactly once, and No pair of people play together more than once. This is equivalent to finding a $g\times (gp)$ matrix such that each column is a permutation of $\{1,\dots,g\}$ , each number in $\{1,\dots,g\}$ appears $p$ times in each row, and where any two columns agree in at most one place (each column is a player, each row is a round, the entry says which game that player plays in that round). When $p=1$ , this is just a Latin square of order $g$ . My question is, for what values of $g$ and $p$ is this possible ? Also, I am curious if anyone has seen this problem in the literature. This certainly bears a resemblance to the social golfer problem. Both this and the SGP involve dividing $pg$ people into $g$ groups of $p$ over the course of several rounds, such that no pair of people play together twice.

Consider the $p$ people who play Monopoly (say) in the first round. In the next round, they must all play different games, so there must be at least $p$ other games besides Monopoly.

We have an endless supply of bags at our disposal. This would suggest that there is an issue. We could put one marble in some bag $b_1$, and put $b_1$ in another bag $b_2$, and continue this process arbitrarily so that we have an infinite number of combinations. We don't allow this. Each bag used must directly contain at least one marble. Note that we consider the marble combinations as well. For example, if $n=2$, then one idea is to put one marble in a bag $b_1$ and having another bag $b_2$ which contains the other marble along with $b_1.$ This method counts for two baggings, since the two marbles can switch roles.

I researched a little further: With size (cardinality) 1 there is trivially an infinite amount of solutions. With size 2 there is only the trivial $2+2 = 2\cdot 2$ in addition to the first one. With size 3 there are at least $1+2+5=1 \cdot 1 \cdot 8$ , $1+3+3=1\cdot 1\cdot 7$ and $2+2+2=1\cdot 1\cdot 6$ . The multisets could also be of different size: a trivial example would be $2 \cdot 2=4$ but bigger multisets would be more interesting because there would actually be addition and multiplication... It is obvious that we can use brute force - the possible numbers are quite limited. But is there an elegant way of finding the amount of solutions for given sizes of $A$ and $B$ ? Of course the order of members doesn't matter, only the contents of the multisets. Addendum on 3 Aug: For exercise, I add some definitions and notions I encountered. But it's still not an answer. Let $A$ and $B$ be multisets of $\mathbb{Z}_+$ . We can define a relation: $sprod(A, B): (\prod{A} = \sum{B}) \land (\prod{B} = \sum{A})$ (quite informal, but should suffice here) This relation is not reflexive nor irreflexive (some of the multisets involved are sprod-related to themselves, most are not). The relation is symmetric: $sprod(A, B)$ implies $sprod(B, A)$ . For a multiset $A$ we can define an ordered pair $(s(A) = \sum{A}, p(A) = \prod{A})$ . $sprod(A, B)$ means that $s(A) = p(B)$ and $s(B) = p(A)$ . So the brute force search must find multisets of given size where $p(A)\le s(A)$ because they are the rare cases. If $p(A)=s(A)$ we have found $sprod(A, A)$ . That could be called $selfsprod$ and indicated by $sprod(A, s(A))$ . For example, $sprod(\{1,2,3\}, 6)$ . If $p(A)<s(A)$ , there is a good chance that we find a mirror case $B$ where the ordered pair is swapped. Then $sprod(A, B)$ . If $n$ is prime, only $sprod(\{n\}, n)$ . That is the trivial case that gives infinite solutions, so not any of our interest. There are no $sprod(A, n)$ so that $|A|>1$ . If $n$ is composite, there is always a selfsprod found: take at least one divisor out, write $n$ in that form (two or more divisors) and fill enough 1's so that the sum goes to $n$ . For example, $sprod(\{1,1,1,3,3\}, 9)$ . This also yields a family of sprods: if we write the previous in the form $sprod(\{1^3,3,3\}, 9)$ , there are also $sprod(\{1^2,3,3\}, \{1,8\})$ , $sprod(\{1,3,3\}, \{1,1,7\})$ and $sprod(\{3,3\}, \{1,1,1,6\})$ . More generally, $sprod(\{1^n,A\}, k)$ gives $sprod(\{1^{n-1},A\}, \{1,k-1\})$ and all the way to $sprod(\{A\}, \{1^n,k-n\})$ . If $sprod(A, A)$ , and so $sprod(A, n)$ , in any sprod $A$ can be replaced with $n$ and vice versa.
