0,Prove or disprove: Every polygon with an even number of vertices may be partitioned by diagonals into quadrilaterals,Prove or disprove: Every polygon with an even number of vertices may be partitioned by diagonals into quadrilaterals,,"Question : True or False? Every polygon with an even number of vertices may be partitioned by diagonals into quadrilaterals. Details : Any orthogonal polygon may be partitioned by diagonals into convex quadrilaterals. (The proof is available on chapter 2 of ""Art Gallery Theorems and Algorithms"", by Joseph O'Rourke). We also know that orthogonal polygons have even number of vertices. So, it's natural to guess that all polygons having an even number of vertices can be partitioned by their diagonals into quadrilaterals.  Is this guess true? Note: I already know that making the guess stronger by changing from ""quadrilaterals"" to ""convex quadrilaterals"" is not true and I have a counterexample for that. But all of the polygons I draw could be partitioned into quadrilaterals.  So, if the guess is true, one should probably propose an algorithm to do the partitioning, and if not, a counterexample should be provided.","Question : True or False?

1,Layman's proof that the area of a circle of radius $r$ equals $\pi r^2$.,Layman's proof that the area of a circle of radius  equals .,r \pi r^2,"There are many, many clear and simple proofs of basic but nontrivial facts in high-school mathematics, such as Pythagoras' theorem or the identities $$\sum_{k=1}^nk=\binom{n}{2}\qquad\text{ and }\qquad\sum_{k=1}^n(2k-1)=n^2,$$ that are accessible to the lay person, having no mathematical knowledge beyond perhaps the most basic high-school curriculum, or perhaps even elementary school. See the answers to this question for many such proofs. I'm surprised I can't find such a proof for the fact that the area of a circle of radius $r$ equals $\pi r^2$ that is thoroughly convincing . Let me explain what I find unconvcing about two popular visual proofs. Parallellogram proof The proof I see most often is the parallellogram proof , cutting the circle radially into ever smaller wedges and joining them together to approximate a parallellogram: It leaves the question of convergence open; do these approximations of parallellograms converge to a rectangle with side lengths $r$ and $\pi r$ as we take ever smaller wedges? It turns out that they do and the argument can be made rigorous, but to the critical lay person this need not be clear from the picture. Triangle proof Another proof I have seen quite often is the triangle proof , cutting the circle into ever thinner concentric rings and unwrapping them to approximate a right triangle: Again this leaves the question of convergence; do these approximations of right triangles converge to a right triangle of height $r$ and base $2\pi r$ ? Again it turns out that they do and the argument can be made rigorous, but again to the critical lay person this need not be clear from the picture. Other proofs either require techniques beyond the most basic high-school curriculum, such as calculus for the onion proof , or are computationally involved such as Archimedes' proof or variations thereof. I do assume that the layman is familiar with the fact that the circumference of a circle of radius $r$ equals $2\pi r$ .

9,Circle rotating within a circle (roulette),Circle rotating within a circle (roulette),,"This was something in a course of mine I'm a bit too thick to see. If one takes a circle of radius $3$ and a circle of radius $1$, and rolls the smaller circle smoothly inside the larger one until the point $P$ which starts out in contact with the larger circle is in the same place, how can one prove that the smaller circle goes through exactly two rotations? The curve generated by the path of the vector $\mathbf{P}$ (the vector from the center of the larger circle to $P$) is called a roulette - more specifically, a deltoid. If you trust the picture, then you can see that the smaller circle does go through two rotations: letting $\mathbf{C}$ be the center of the smaller circle, the little vector pointing from $\mathbf{C}$ to $\mathbf{P}$ rotates around to pointing due right exactly twice, so the circle rotates twice also. But I don't know how to prove this. This question came up because we wanted to find the parametric equation of $\mathbf{P}$. It'll be the sum of the vectors $\mathbf{C}$ and $\mathbf{P- C}$; the first one has equation $(2\cos(t), 2\sin(t))$, and if the smaller circle rotates around (clockwise) exactly two times, it'll have the equation $(\cos(2t), -\sin(2t))$.

By solving $f'(x)=0$ , we see that the only extremum value is at $x=M/2$ , but this is a maximum (by looking at the second derivative or a simple example).

In the former case, $\gamma>90°, M<90°$ , and $f(x)$ tends to $f(0)=1+\cos M >1$ , so $f(x)\ge 1$ .

30,Calculating the curvature of product manifold $\mathbb{S}^2 \times \mathbb{R}$,Calculating the curvature of product manifold,\mathbb{S}^2 \times \mathbb{R},"I've read that $\mathbb{S}^2 \times \mathbb{R}$ is one of the model geometries of Thurston which has non constant curvature. I took it to mean that the manifold $(\mathbb{S}^2 \times \mathbb{R}, g)$ has non constant sectional curvature (where $g$ is the standard product metric) and tried to compute its sectional curvature. Here's what I used: Let $(M, g_1)$ and $(N, g_2)$ be two Riemannian manifolds with curvature tensors $R_1$ and $R_2$ . Using that for each $(p, q) \in M \times N$ , $T_pM \oplus T_q N \cong T_{(p, q)}(M \times N)$ , for each $X, Y, Z \in \Gamma(T(M \times N))$ , we have: $R(X, Y)Z = R_1(X_1, Y_1)Z_1 + R_2(X_2, Y_2)Z_2$ $\text{Rm}(X, Y, Z, W) = \langle R(X,Y)Z, W \rangle$ where $X = (X_1, X_2)$ , with $X_1 \in \Gamma(TM)$ , $X_2 \in \Gamma(TN)$ and analogously for $Y$ and $Z$ , and the metric on $M \times N$ is given by: $$g^{M \times N}_{(p, q)}(X, Y) = g^{M}_{p}(X_1, Y_1) + g^{N}_{q}(X_2, Y_2)$$ Denoting by $R_1$ the curvature tensor for the sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$ and by $R_2$ the one for the real line, it's obvious that $R_2 \equiv 0$ . Now, let $X, Y$ be an orthonormal basis for a $2$ plane contained in some tangent space of $\mathbb{S}^2 \times \mathbb{R}$ . We have: $$\begin{align}R(X,Y)Y  &= R(X_1 + X_2, Y_1 + Y_2)( X_1 + X_2)\\ &= R(X_1, Y_1)X_1 + R(X_2, Y_1)X_1 + R(X_1, Y_2)X_1 + R(X_2, Y_2)X_1& \\ &+R(X_1, Y_1)X_2 + R(X_2, Y_1)X_2 + R(X_1, Y_2)X_2 + R(X_2, Y_2)X_2 \\ &= R_{1}(X_1, Y_1)X_1  \end{align}$$ since all the other terms disappear, where we're using that $R_2 \equiv 0$ . Then: $$\begin{align}K(X, Y) &= \langle R(X, Y)Y, X \rangle \\ &= \langle R_1(X_1, Y_1)Y_1, X_1 \rangle + \langle R_1(X_1, Y_1)Y_1, X_2 \rangle \\ &= \langle R_1(X_1, Y_1)Y_1, X_1 \rangle = 1  \end{align}$$ because $\mathbb{S}^2$ has constant sectional curvature equal to $1$ . So we have that $\mathbb{S}^2 \times \mathbb{R}$ has constant sectional curvature as well. Where did I make a mistake here? Or does $\mathbb{S}^2 \times \mathbb{R}$ actually have constant curvature?

I came up with this, but I want to make sure I didn't make any errors before giving it to him. First, I assumed that the $n$ -gon was inscribed in a circle of radius r centered at the origin, with the first vertex of the circle being at the point $(r,0)$ . The vertices of the $n$ -gon will divide the circle into $n$ equal sections. Because the total angle of a circle is $2\pi$ , then the angle between the $x$ -axis and the second vertex is $\frac{2\pi}{n}$ . Using trigonometry, the coordinates of this vertex are $\left(r\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{n}\right), r\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{n}\right)\right)$ . Now, the origin, the first vertex, and the second vertex form a triangle. The edge of this triangle which touches the circle in two places, using the distance formula, will have a length of $r\sqrt{\left(\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{n}\right)-1\right)^2 + \left(\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{n}\right)\right)^2}$ . Now, the $n$ -gon will be made up of $n$ of these triangles, and so the perimeter is: $nr\sqrt{\left(\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{n}\right)-1\right)^2 + \left(\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{n}\right)\right)^2}$ . Now, the triangle has a base of $r$ and a height of $r\sin(\frac{2\pi}{n})$ . There area of a triangle is half the product of its base and height, so the area of the triangle is $\frac{r^2\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{n}\right)}{2}$ .

The first question there dealt with bracing polygons; it was pointed out that Maehara had proved in 1991 the equivalence of ""braceable distances"" with algebraic numbers. The easier second question dealt with bracing the square roots of integers using as few edges as possible. One of Maehara's gadgets, the fan, allows dividing arbitrary angles into any number of equal parts; this also implies that all regular polygons can be braced. Since $\pi$ is transcendental, squaring the circle is obviously out of the question. Of the three main geometric problems of antiquity, doubling the cube remains; this is the focus of my question here. What is the minimum number of unit edges required to brace $\sqrt[3]2$ ?

The latter's correctness has been verified here .) I need to implement two constraints: $\angle AOB$ being right and $\angle ABC=120^\circ$ . To do so, I turn to one of Maehara's gadgets, the jack : The part of this gadget between $O,A,B,C$ is what he calls the reverser , which forces $\angle COB=\angle BOA$ . $AO$ is extended to $E$ and $OCDE$ is a rhombus; this forces $\angle BOD$ to be right while letting $OD$ vary. By a small modification to this gadget – defining $F$ on $OA$ and $G$ on $OC$ with $OF=OG$ and then erecting a rhombus $OFHG$ – I can also implement collinearity: $H$ must lie on the line defined by $OB$ . Here are the standard and collinear jacks in my bracing of $\sqrt[3]2$ , labelled with the corresponding points in my construction: Note how $\angle ABC=120^\circ$ is enforced by a simple extension of the trusses keeping the jack's bars straight.

See, in computer graphics each side of a polygon or triangle are considered separate entities and so I specifically desired to capture this within the geometry I constructed. Below, I will describe the different properties I know of to see if anyone can identify it as anything previously studied. The Structure Itself Let us define a special triangular mesh. Let's just call it a ""half-triangle mesh"" since I don't know what else to call it. In this context we define a half-triangle mesh to be a collection of half-triangles and we define a half-triangle to be an ordered triplet of points. These points technically form the vertices of Euclidean triangle in space. Now comes the somewhat weird part. We can say that a half-triangle only has one side. If we look at it from a geodesic perspective and a physics perspective, from the side in space where the points are in clockwise order, there is nothing on that side. Literal emptiness. The geodesics will behave as if that triangle isn't there. However, from the other side, the half-triangle does exist and geodesics extending onto that triangle will behave as if it is there. Think of it like a one way window. Geodesics Now I did technically say a bit about the geodesics, but let me be more rigorous. When triangles facing the right direction form a surface like in a triangular mesh or this image geodesics behave like you would expect. In fact, two half-triangles with the same three points but facing in opposite directions form a regular triangle. The unusual case is if we had a shape like in the T-surface within the below thing I found on google images. If all the protrusions are formed by normal triangles, then under my system the blue line is a geodesic/straight line. Whereas if the surface was formed by half-triangles and the unseen backsides did not have any half-triangles, then by extending the green lines according to the allowed rule set forth in Euclid's second postulate which states ""lines may be extended infinitely in either direction"" we get the following: I hope the image makes sense. Basically, when there is no side from where the line is coming from, the line just ignores it and passes by it (hence the action of the blue line). Furthermore because there is no backside for the red line to wrap around onto, it just ends. These are just two examples. Note, that this also means that by extending backwards along the blue line, the blue line can essentially grow a perpendicular segment that is part of the line. This essentially means that the lines in this system can split and branch wherever a lone half-triangle intersects a plane on the side that exists. I feel that this is in particular an important property of this geometric system. Let's presume that this concept can be extended to 'surfaces' in general. Not just polygons.
