Here's my reasoning: The function $f$ is continuous. Pick $\delta \gt 0$ , by definition closed balls (neighborhoods) are compact; so define $\bar{B}_n(\mathbf 0,n\delta) =\{ \mathbf x\in\mathbb R^n :\Vert\mathbf x\Vert \le n\delta\}$ for $n \in \mathbb N$ , and define $f_n:\bar{B}_n(\mathbf 0,n\delta) \to \mathbb R$ as $f_n=\sum_{j=1}^{k} \Vert \mathbf x -\mathbf{a}_j\Vert^2$ . By the maximum/minimum value Theorem there is a $\mathbf y \in \bar{B}_n(\mathbf 0,n\delta) $ such that $f_n(\mathbf y)\le f_n(\mathbf x)$ for all $\mathbf x \in \bar{B}_n(\mathbf 0,n\delta)$ . Call $f_n(\mathbf y)= y_n$ . For all $k \in \mathbb N$ we have: $y_{n+1} \le y_n$ because $\bar{B}_k(\mathbf 0,k\delta) \subset \bar{B}_{k+1}(\mathbf 0,(k+1)\delta)$ , and $y_k \ge 0$ because $f_k(\mathbf x) \ge 0$ for all $\mathbf x$ s in the domain; so the sequence $\{y_n\}$ is bounded below and non increasing, hence it converges, as $n \to \infty$ , to a number $y$ . $y$ is the global minimum of $f(\mathbf x)=\sum_{j=1}^{k} \Vert \mathbf x -\mathbf{a}_j\Vert^2$ . I'm not so sure if I can claim that $y$ is indeed the global minimum of the function $f$ EDIT: I don't seem to be able to complete the proof with my method, also I'm thinking that if I prove there is a closed ball big enough (with all the $\mathbf a_i$ s in it) such that every element $\mathbf q$ outside the ball has its $f( \mathbf q)$ greater than the minimum inside then all the work above is superfluous. People in the comments and in the answers have provided a more efficient strategy: Let $f(\mathbf a_1)=\sum_{j=2}^{k} \Vert \mathbf a_1 - \mathbf a_j\Vert^2=M$ , and define the closed ball $\bar{B}(\mathbf a_1,\sqrt{M})= \{ \mathbf x \in \mathbb R^n: \Vert \mathbf x - \mathbf a_1 \Vert \le \sqrt{M} \}$ . By the minimum value theorem there is some $\mathbf y$ in $\bar{B}(\mathbf a_1,\sqrt{M})$ such that $f(\mathbf y) \le f(\mathbf x)$ for all $\mathbf x$ in $\bar{B}(\mathbf a_1,\sqrt{M})$ . Pick any element $\mathbf q \notin \bar{B}(\mathbf a_1,\sqrt{M})$ , which means that $0 \le \sqrt{M} \lt \Vert \mathbf q - \mathbf a_1 \Vert$ and thus $M \lt \Vert \mathbf q - \mathbf a_1 \Vert ^2$ . By definition we have $f(\mathbf y) \le f(\mathbf a_1) = M$ , but it's also true that $\Vert \mathbf q - \mathbf a_1 \Vert \le f(\mathbf q)$ .
