0,A Shorter Proof of Rosser's Theorem Without Using The Prime Number Theorem,A Shorter Proof of Rosser's Theorem Without Using The Prime Number Theorem,,While researching on the elementary proof of Bertrand's Postulate I came to know about a theorem of Rosser's which states that $p_n$ $>$ $n$ $\text{ln}$ $n$. I have seen Rosser's original proof and I am interested in shorter proof of the result. It will be best if it could be proved using elementary methods. Any suggestion will be appreciated.,While researching on the elementary proof of Bertrand's Postulate I came to know about a theorem of Rosser's which states that $p_n$ $>$ $n$ $\text{ln}$ $n$.

I tried it this way: If $m$ is a prime $p$,it is obvious that most importantly, we need to prove that every non-zero element in $\mathbb{Z_p}$ has an inverse in $\mathbb{Z_p}$.We note that if $a,b\in \mathbb{Z_p}$, then $a\cdot b\in \mathbb{Z_p} \dots \boxed{*}$. Next, $a^p\equiv a \bmod p$ for prime $p$(the proof follows by induction on $a$).As  $\displaystyle 0\leq a\leq p-1$,$a\not =p$. Thus $$a^{p-1}\equiv 1 \bmod p$$ for prime $p$ which,together with $\boxed{*}$ guarantees the existence of an inverse in $\mathbb{Z_p}$.Proving the other properties is simple. Conversely,if $\mathbb{Z_m}$ is a field,then every non-zero element of $\mathbb{Z_m}$ has an inverse.Note that inverse of an element is unique.For if $a\cdot b\equiv a\cdot c\equiv 1 \bmod m$,then $(a\cdot b)\cdot c\equiv c\equiv (a\cdot c)\cdot b\equiv b \bmod m$ i.e $m|(b-c)\implies b-c=0(0\leq a\leq m-1,a\in \mathbb{Z_m})$.So, inverses must be unique and every element is either an inverse of itself or has in inverse in the field.That allows us to conclude that $[(m-1)!]^2\equiv 1 \bmod m$ which can only mean that either  $(m-1)!\equiv 1 \bmod m$ or $(m-1)!\equiv -1 \bmod m$. If $m$ is not a prime, it has a prime factor, say $p$. $ 0\leq p\leq m-1\implies p|(m-1)!\implies p|1$or $-1$ which is absurd, a contradiction.Thus $m$ is prime. I feel that this method is too involved and complicated. Can anyone please suggest some other method?(Some context: This is a problem from Finite Dimensional Vector Spaces by Paul Halmos.

Riemann had already conjectured this in 1859 and since he needed an 'always real' function for his next thought steps, he assumed $s=\frac12 + t i$ and defined the function $\Xi(t)=\xi(s)$ that has been proven to be equal to: $$\Xi(t)= \Xi(0)\prod_\gamma\left(1-\frac{t^2}{\gamma^2}\right)$$ It is known that $\xi(s)=\xi(1-s)$ and $\xi(s)=\overline{\xi(\overline{s})}$ and this implies that $\xi(s)\xi(\overline{s})$ must be real. Also known is that when there is a non-trivial zero $\rho$ lying off the critical line, then also $1-\rho, \overline{\rho}, \overline{1-\rho}$ must be zeros and their product will always be real: $$\displaystyle\prod_\gamma\left(1-\frac{s}{\sigma+i \gamma}\right) \left(1-\frac{s}{\sigma-i \gamma}\right)\left(1-\frac{s}{1-(\sigma+i \gamma)}\right) \left(1-\frac{s}{\overline{1-(\sigma+i \gamma)}}\right)$$ This brought me to the following conjecture.

I work a lot with numbers (finance) but very much an amateur mathematician - please be gentle. I have the following problem that has come from discussions about cryptography: Given a set of prime numbers $p_1, p_2,...,p_n$ and sets $S_{p_1},S_{p_2},..., S_{p_n}$ containing a selection of modular residue classes with respect to each prime, find the smallest positive integer $q$ that is congruent to a residue class in each $S_i, i = 1,...,n$ . Example: $p_1 = 7$ , $p_2 = 11$ , $p_3 = 13 $ $S_1 = \{[0]_7,[1]_7,[6]_7\}$ $S_2 = \{[1]_{11},[5]_{11},[6]_{11},[10]_{11}\}$ $S_3 = \{[2]_{13},[5]_{13},[8]_{13},[11]_{13}\}$ By the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) there will always be a solution if the $S_i$ s are non-empty. A brute force approach is to take all combinations of elements from the $S_i$ s, apply the CRT to each one in turn and keep track of the smallest. For example, if we take the first elements from each of the sets above, we can use CRT to solve the following system of equations for q: $$ q \equiv 0 \mod 7 \\ q \equiv 1 \mod 11 \\ q \equiv 2 \mod 13 $$ In this case q = 210. Repeating this process for all the other combinations, we can establish that the smallest possible q is actually 21 ( $\equiv [0]_7 \equiv [10]_{11} \equiv [8]_{13} $ ) Of course, this is fine to do when the number of primes and the size of the $S_i$ s is small, but blows up quite quickly if they get larger. I'm interested in establishing whether a better algorithm could do this more efficiently and ultimately what is the complexity of this problem in a computational sense. Any smart ideas? Literature recommendations or theorems in particular that might point me in the right direction would be most appreciated!
