1,How to use axiom of extensionality,How to use axiom of extensionality,,Assume $x = y$ and we want to proof $\{x\} = \{y\}$ . I read that this follows from the axiom of extensionality.

Am I doing this correctly or am I assuming things I can't directly assume?

5,Rigorous definition of Cartesian product,Rigorous definition of Cartesian product,,"Recall the 'rigorous' definition of the Cartesian product $A\times B$ is the set of all functions $\phi:\{1,2\}\to A\cup B$ such that $\phi(1)\in A$ and $\phi(2)\in B$ . To show there is a bijective correspondence between the sets $A_1\space\times ...\times\space A_n$ and $\left(A_1\space\times...\times\space A_{n-1}\right)\times A_n$ , I'd like to appeal to this definition.

So $h(1)$ is not an element of any single $A_i$ but is a $n-1$ tuple or an arbitrary function $g$ . However, $h(2)$ is just any element of $A_n$ .

Note that this is not a duplicate of understanding the algebras of the powerset monad , which concerns the monad $P':\set\to\set$ which takes maps to direct images.  This question was also flagged as duplicate of what are the algebras of the double powerset monad , which is very close, although I am more interested in sets than in Boolean algebras. This is what I got so far: Let $P:\set\op\to\set$ be the powerset functor with left adjoint $P\op:\set\to\set\op$ where the unit $\eta(U):U\to PP\op U$ maps $x\in U$ to the set $\{X\subseteq U:x\in X\}$ and the counit $\eps$ is just the corresponding arrow in the opposite category.  So we can construct a monad $T:=PP\op$ from this adjoint pair as usual with $\mu(U):TTU\to TU$ defined via $$TTU=PP\op PP\op U\xra{P\eps(P\op U)} PP\op U=TU$$ and I wonder how the algebras over this monad look like. Recall that an algebra over $U$ is a map $a:TU\to U$ such that $U\xra{\eta(U)}TU\xra{a} U=\id(U)$ and $TTU\xra{\mu(U)}TU\xra{a}U=TTU\xra{T(a)}TU\xra{a}U$ . (1.) is relatively straight forward, the set of all $X$ containing $x$ must be mapped back to $x$ by $a$ . For (2.), note is that both, $\mu(U)$ and $T(a)$ , are of the shape $Pf$ for some $f:P\op U\to P\op TU$ , so given some $W\in TTU$ , they return all $X\in P\op U$ such that $f(X)\in W$ .  This relation can further simplified by noting that if $a$ already satisfies (1.), $f$ is in both cases injective.  For $\mu(U)$ we have $f_0:=e(P\op U)$ mapping $X$ to the principal filter containing all $Y\in TU$ with $X\in Y$ , which is clearly injective, and for $T(a)$ we have $f_1:=P\op(a)$ which maps $X$ to the set of $Y$ with $a(Y)\in X$ , which is also injective since $\eta(U)$ is injective and $a$ satisfies (1.).  Let $W_i$ be the image of $P\op U$ under $f_i$ and let $Y_{0\cap 1}$ be the inverse image of $W_0\cap W_1$ . So $a$ is only allowed to care for elements in $Y_{0\cap 1}$ , since the others can be independently added or removed under $f_0$ and $f_1$ by changing $W$ accordingly. We can see that $W_0$ is what I call a disjoint free antichain, for $Z_0\neq Z'_0\in W_0$ , let's say $Z_0$ is the principal filter of $X$ and $Z'_0$ the principal filter of $X'$ , neither $Z_0\subset Z'_0$ nor $Z'_0\subset Z_0$ nor $Z_0\cap Z'_0=\emptyset$ since only $Z_0$ contains $\{X\}$ , only $Z'_0$ contains $\{X'\}$ and both contain $\{X,X'\}$ .  On the other hand, if $X\subset X'$ , clearly $f_1(X)\subseteq f_1(X')$ and by (1.) also $f_1(X)\subset f_1(X')$ , a contradiction.  Similar with $X\cap X'=\emptyset$ , so it follows that $Y_{0\cap 1}$ must inherit the disjoint free antichain property from $W_0$ . But from (1.) we can also see that if $x,x'\in U$ with $x\neq x'$ , we must have $X,X'\in Y_{0\cap 1}$ such that $X$ contains $x$ but not $x'$ and $X'$ contains $x'$ but not $x$ , otherwise $\eta(U)x\cap Y_{0\cap 1}=\eta(U)x'\cap Y_{0\cap 1}$ and $a$ would not be able to differentiate the two sets. So all in all we have this strange system of disjoint free antichains which can differentiate between all elements.  I don't know if there is a special name for this property.","Can someone help me to understand how algebras over the monad , with being the powerset functor taking maps to inverse images, look like?

I sometimes talk about class-sized things (and frequently make mistakes when doing so), so I am in the market for a set theory that supports multiple levels of classes or something similar like the flattened hierarchy of NFU, even if the resulting classes are less flexible than sets. I'm wondering whether this strawman theory is consistent given that ZFC and NFU are both consistent individually. I'm also curious whether there's a real way to combine these theories together so you have a set theory with ZFC at the bottom rung and more rigid classes on the higher rungs. The alternative set theory NFU can be axiomatized with two axioms and an axiom schema. An axiom of infinity or axiom of choice can also be added without breaking consistency as far as I know. $\varnothing$ does not contain any elements. Any entities that contain at least one element are equal if their elements are equal. Let $\varphi$ be a stratified formula with parameters. There exists a set $X$ such that all entities $e$ are in $X$ if and only if they satisfy $\varphi$ . Superficially, sets in NFU seem very classlike to me. You can have a set of all groups and even a universal set as long as you respect the quasi-type-system when invoking comprehension.

Notice that, because $A$ is finite, $f^{-1} (\{a\})$ is finite for each $a$ , so $N(a)$ is well-defined. As $f$ is injective, for each $a$ , $N(a) \leq 1$ ; otherwise, for some $a \in A$ , there exist distinct preimages $b,b' \in A$ such that $f(b) = a = f(b')$ , contradicting injectivity of $f$ . Furthermore, as the fibres of $f$ partition its domain, we have $\sum\limits_{a \in A} N(a) = |A|$ . Suppose for the sake of contradiction that $f$ is not surjective. Then $A \setminus f(A) \neq \emptyset$ , so there exists $t \in A \setminus f(A)$ . Then $N(t) < 1$ , i.e., $N(t) = 0$ . We then have \begin{align*} \sum\limits_{a \in A} N(a) = \sum\limits_{a \in A \setminus \{t\}} N(a) + N(t) \leq \sum\limits_{a \in A \setminus \{t\}} 1 + N(t) = |A\setminus \{t\}| + 0 < |A| \end{align*} since $A \setminus \{t\}$ is a proper subset of $A$ , contradicting surjectivity of $f$ . Therefore, there exists no such $t$ , and we have $A \setminus f(A) = \emptyset$ , hence $A = f(A)$ , so $f$ is surjective. How does this look?

28,Proof check. There is no set containing all abelian groups,Proof check. There is no set containing all abelian groups,,"Let $X$ be an infinite set and $Y$ be the set of finite subsets of $X$ . Show that there is a bijective map from $X$ to $Y$ . Show that $(Y, \Delta)$ is an abelian group (where $\Delta$ is symmetric difference.) Use it to show that every nonempty set can be given an abelian group structure. Deduce that there is no set containing all abelian groups. I think I have proved, what was asked in above question, but am not 100% sure, mostly in part 3,4, (though I have added other part in case, i have done something wrong. First part is already known to me as it is available on this site as well) $Y = \{Z \subset X : |Z| < \infty  \}$ . We need to show that $|X| = |Y|$ . I was able to prove this when $X$ is countable. Though I was not able to prove it in general, but was able to get the same result on this site. Since $Y \subset P(X)$ , and $(P(X), \Delta)$ is indeed an Abelian group, so we just need to check the closure property and existence of inverse. Since $B \in Y $ is its own inverse, and for $B, C \in Y$ , $|B \Delta C| \leq |B|+|C|$ so is finite and and hence an element of $Y$ . Hence the claim. Let $X\neq \varnothing$ . Case 1. $X$ is finite. In this case we have say, $X = \{x_{0},x_{1}, \cdots x_{n-1}\}$ . Define $\star:X \times X \to X$ as $x_{i} \star x_{j} = x_{(i+j) \,\text{mod(n)}}$ , where $i \in \{0,1, \cdots n-1 \}$ and, Clearly here, we have $x_{i}\star x_{j} = x_{j} \star x_{i}$ also, $x_0$ is identity element and $x_{n - i}$ is inverse of $x_{i}$ (where $x_n = x_0$ ). Case 2. $X$ is infinite. Let, $f: X \to Y$ be a bijection from $X$ to $Y$ which exists because of part 1. Define $\star: X \times X \to X$ as follows, for $a, b \in X$ , $a \star b = f^{-1}(f(a) \Delta f(b))$ , which is an element of $X$ , and $f^{-1}$ exists and is bijection, so well defined binary map. Existence of Identity Since $f$ is bijection, so there exists $a_0 \in X$ such that $f(a_0) = \varnothing$ (Since $\varnothing \in Y$ ). This $a_0$ is identity element, since $a \star a_0 = f^{-1}(f(a) \Delta f(a_0)) = f^{-1}(f(a)\Delta \varnothing) = f^{-1}(f(a)) = a$ . Inverse $a$ is self inverse, since $a \star a = f^{-1}(f(a) \Delta f(a)) = f^{-1}(\varnothing) = a_0$ . Associativity It follows since $(a \star b) \star c = f^{-1}(f(a) \Delta f(b)) \star c = f^{-1}(f(f^{-1}(f(a) \Delta f(b)))\Delta f(c)) = f^{-1}((f(a) \Delta f(b))\Delta f(c)) = f^{-1}(f(a)\Delta (f(b)\Delta f(c))) = a \star f^{-1}(f(b) \Delta f(c)) = a \star (b \star c)$ . Commutativity Finally since $a \star b = f^{-1}(f(a) \Delta f(b)) = f^{-1}(f(b) \Delta f(a)) = b \star a$ , hence $\star$ is commutative. For this I thought since, every set can be given a Abelian structure, so if such a set exists, it will contain all sets.

30,Proof for $\alpha \times \beta \cong \alpha \otimes \beta$,Proof for,\alpha \times \beta \cong \alpha \otimes \beta,"I need to prove the following theorem: Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be ordinals. Then $\alpha \times \beta \cong \alpha \otimes \beta$ , where $\alpha \times \beta$ is in anti-lexicographic order. I have come up with one proof, and I would like to get it validated. Proof. The case $\alpha = \boldsymbol{0}$ is trivial, as $\alpha \times \beta = \alpha \otimes \beta = \boldsymbol{0}$ . We shall assume $\alpha \neq \boldsymbol{0}$ in our following argument. Suppose that $\delta$ is an ordinal. Fix an ordinal $\alpha \neq \boldsymbol{0}$ and define the following set: \begin{equation*} A = \left\{\beta \in \delta: \alpha \times \beta \cong \alpha \otimes \beta\right\}. \end{equation*} First consider the case $\beta = \boldsymbol{0}$ . As \begin{equation*} \alpha \times \boldsymbol{0} = \alpha \otimes \boldsymbol{0} = \boldsymbol{0}, \end{equation*} it is obvious that $\boldsymbol{0} \in A$ . Next assume that $\gamma \subseteq A$ and $\gamma \neq \emptyset$ . That is, for any $\theta \in \gamma$ , $\alpha \times \theta \cong \alpha \otimes \theta$ . Suppose $\gamma = {\theta_{0}}^{+}$ for some $\theta_{0} \in \gamma$ . Then \begin{equation*} \alpha \times \gamma = \alpha \times {\theta_{0}}^{+} = \alpha \times \left(\theta_{0} \cup \left\{\theta_{0}\right\}\right) = \left(\alpha \times \theta_{0}\right) \cup \left(\alpha \times \left\{\theta_{0}\right\}\right), \end{equation*} and \begin{equation*} \alpha \otimes \gamma = \alpha \otimes {\theta_{0}}^{+} = \left(\alpha \otimes \theta_{0}\right) \oplus \alpha. \end{equation*} Using our induction hypothesis, we have $\alpha \times \theta_{0} \cong \alpha \otimes \theta_{0}$ . Thus, there is an order-isomorphism $f_{1}: \alpha \otimes \theta_{0} \to \alpha \times \theta_{0}$ . Next, assume that $\lambda \in \alpha$ . We immediately have $\left(\alpha \otimes \theta_{0}\right) \oplus \lambda \not\in \alpha \otimes \theta_{0}$ . There is an order-isomorphism $f_{2}: \left\{\left(\alpha \otimes \theta_{0}\right) \oplus \lambda: \lambda \in \alpha\right\} \to \alpha \times \left\{\theta_{0}\right\}$ such that \begin{equation*} \forall \lambda \in \alpha, f_{2}\left(\alpha \otimes \theta_{0} \oplus \lambda\right) = \left(\lambda,\theta_{0}\right). \end{equation*} Define a function $f_{3}: \left(\alpha \otimes \theta_{0}\right) \oplus \alpha \to \left(\alpha \times \theta_{0}\right) \cup \left(\alpha \times \left\{\theta_{0}\right\}\right)$ such that \begin{equation*} f_{3}\left(x\right) =  \begin{cases} f_{1}\left(x\right),\ x \in \alpha \otimes \theta_{0}\\ f_{2}\left(x\right),\ x \in \left(\alpha \otimes \theta_{0}\right) \oplus \alpha \textrm{ and } x \not\in \alpha \otimes \theta_{0} \end{cases}. \end{equation*} In this way, we have defined an order-isomorphism $f_{3}: \alpha \otimes \gamma \to \alpha \times \gamma$ , and we have $\alpha \otimes \gamma \cong \alpha \times \gamma$ . Thus, we may conclude that $\gamma \subseteq A$ leads to $\gamma \in A$ when $\gamma$ is a successor ordinal. Now suppose that $\gamma$ is a limit ordinal. Then according to definition, we have \begin{equation*} \alpha \otimes \gamma = \bigcup\left\{\alpha \otimes \lambda: \lambda \in \gamma\right\}, \end{equation*} and further, \begin{equation*} \alpha \times \gamma = \alpha \times \bigcup{\gamma} = \bigcup\left\{\alpha \times \lambda: \lambda \in \gamma\right\}. \end{equation*} According to our induction hypothesis, for any $\lambda \in \gamma$ , we have $\alpha \otimes \lambda \cong \alpha \times \lambda$ . Thus, there is a order-isomorphism $f_{\lambda}: \alpha \otimes \lambda \to \alpha \times \lambda$ for every $\lambda \in \gamma$ . We may define the functions so that $f_{\lambda_{1}} = f_{\lambda_{2}}\vert_{\lambda_{1}}$ , if $\lambda_{1} \in \lambda_{2} \in \gamma$ (so that $\lambda_{1} \subseteq \lambda_{2}$ ). Define a set \begin{equation*} g = \left\{f_{\lambda} \in \mathscr{P}\left(\left(\alpha \otimes \gamma\right) \times \left(\alpha \times \lambda\right)\right): \lambda \in \gamma\right\}, \end{equation*} and further another set \begin{equation*} f = \bigcup g. \end{equation*} We first argue that $f$ is a function. If it is not, then there exist at least two 2-tuples $\left(x_{0},y_{1}\right), \left(x_{0},y_{2}\right) \in f$ with $y_{1} \neq y_{2}$ . Then there are $\lambda_{1}, \lambda_{2} \in \gamma$ such that $\lambda_{1} \neq \lambda_{2}$ and $\left(x_{0},y_{1}\right) \in f_{\lambda_{1}}$ and $\left(x_{0},y_{2}\right) \in f_{\lambda_{2}}$ . Without loss of generality, we assume $\lambda_{1} \in \lambda_{2}$ . As $f_{\lambda_{1}} = f_{\lambda_{2}}\vert_{\lambda_{1}}$ , we have $y_{1} = y_{2}$ . This contradicts our assumption for $y_{1}$ and $y_{2}$ . Thus, $f$ is a function. We then argue that $\operatorname{Domain}\left(f\right) = \alpha \otimes \gamma$ and $\operatorname{Range}\left(f\right) = \alpha \times \gamma$ . This step is straightforward, as \begin{equation*} \operatorname{Domain}\left(f\right) = \bigcup\left\{\alpha \otimes \lambda: \lambda \in \gamma\right\} = \alpha \otimes \gamma, \end{equation*} and \begin{equation*} \operatorname{Range}\left(f\right) = \bigcup\left\{\alpha \times \lambda: \lambda \in \gamma\right\} = \alpha \times \bigcup \gamma = \alpha \times \gamma. \end{equation*} We shall finally argue that $f$ is an order-isomorphism. Assume $\theta_{1} \in \theta_{2} \in \alpha \otimes \gamma$ . Then there is $\lambda_{0} \in \gamma$ such that $\theta_{1}, \theta_{2} \in \alpha \otimes \lambda_{0}$ . As $f_{\lambda_{0}}\left(\theta_{1}\right) < f_{\lambda_{0}}\left(\theta_{2}\right)$ , we have $f_{\lambda}\left(\theta_{1}\right) < f_{\lambda}\left(\theta_{2}\right)$ . We conclude that $\alpha \otimes \gamma \cong \alpha \times \gamma$ , and that $\gamma \subseteq A$ leads to $\gamma \in A$ when $\gamma$ is a limit ordinal. Finally, we have $A = \delta$ , according to transfinite induction for ordinals.","I need to prove the following theorem: Let and be ordinals. Then , where is in anti-lexicographic order.

The unary union differs from the binary union $X \cup Y$ both algebraically (e.g. by arity), and set-theoretically: it may produce a set of a lower rank than the rank of its operand (one can say that the unary union operation may ""lower the rank""). This last fact is in contrast with the fact that the binary union produces a set of a rank which equals the highest rank of its arguments  (one can say the  binary union ""does not lower the rank""). Recall, the rank of a set is the least ordinal number greater than the rank of any member of the set.

Question: Consider a Peano structure $(P,S,1)$ , where $1 \in P$ and $S:P\rightarrow P$ , Show that $(P,S,1)$ is a Peano system if and only if it satisfies the Iteration Theorem, that is for any set $W$ , any object $c$ in $W$ , and any singulary operation $g$ on $W$ , there is a unique function $F:P\rightarrow W$ such that $F(1)=c$ and $F(S(x)) = g(F(x))$ for all $x$ in $P$ . (see Maclane and Birkhoff [1967], pp. 67-70. Concepts and definitions: By a Peano System we mean a set $P$ , a particular element $1$ in $P$ , and a singulary operation $S$ on $P$ such that the following axioms are satisfied. (P1) $1$ is not the successor $S(x)$ of any object $x$ in $P$ . In Symbols: $$(\forall x)(S(x) \neq 1)$$ (P2) Different objects in $P$ have different successors. This can be formulated as follows: $$(\forall x)(\forall y)(x \neq y \Rightarrow S(x) \neq S(y))$$ (P3) Principle of mathematical induction: Any subset of $P$ containing $1$ and closed under $S$ must be identical with $P$ . This can be symbolically rendered as follows: $$(\forall B)([B \subseteq P \land 1 \in B \land (\forall x)(x \in B \Rightarrow S(x) \in B)] \Rightarrow P=B)$$ Such a Peano System will be denoted by the ordered triple (P,S,1): $P$ is called underlying set , $S$ the successor operation , and $1$ the distinguished element . Iteration Theorem: Consider any Peano system $(P,S,1).$ Let $W$ be an arbitrary set, let $c$ be a fixed element of $W$ , and let $g$ be a singulary opration on $W$ . Then, there is a unique function $F:P \rightarrow W$ such that: $F(1) = c$ $F(S(x)) = g(F(x))$ for all $x$ in $P$ Consider any two Peano systems $\mathscr{P}=(P,S,1)$ and $\mathscr{P}^* = (P^*,S^*,1^*)$ , we say $\mathscr{P}$ and $\mathscr{P}^*$ are isomorphic if and only if there is a one-one correspondence $H$ between $P$ and $P^*$ $$H: P \xrightarrow[onto]{1-1} P^*$$ such that: $H(1) = 1^*$ , and $H(S(x)) = S^*(H(x))$ for all $x$ in $P$ . Such a function $H$ is called an isomorphism between $\mathscr{P}$ and $\mathscr{P}^*$ A set of axioms is said to be categorical if and only if any two models for those axioms are isomorphic. Proved Theorems: Here I will list previus proved Theorem in the text book which I believe its useful for this question. Iteration Theorem (defined above) Any two Peano systems are isomorphic (and the isomorphism is unique) My atempt: My interpretation of the question is that it should be proved an equivalence between a system be a Peano system and satisfying the Iteration Theorem: $$(P',S',1') \text{ is a Peano system} \Leftrightarrow (P',S',1') \text{ satisfies the Iteration Theorem}$$ $[\Rightarrow]$ We have by the definition of Iteration Theorem that it holds for any Peano system, as the Theorem is already proved we are done and just need to prove the converse. $[\Leftarrow]$ First assume some system $(P',S',1')$ , where $P'$ is a set, $1' \in P'$ and $S'$ is a singulary operation on $P'$ and that this system satisfies the Iteration Theorem. From here I thinked about two approaches, where one is too prove that is possible to define an bijection between $P'$ and an already known set in another Peano system like $\mathbb{N}$ to establish an isomorphism, and the other approach is to prove that if any of Peano Axioms dont holds true for $(P',S',1')$ then the Iteration Theorem cannot be satisfied. Tryng the first approach, consider $(\mathbb{N}, S, 1)$ as the Standard Peano system, where $\mathbb{N}$ is the set of natural numbers and $S$ is defined as $S(x) = x+1$ , now using the Iteration Theorem in $(P',S',1')$ , let $W=\mathbb{N}$ , $c=1$ and $g=S$ , therefore we got a unique function $F:P' \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ such that: $F(1') = 1$ , and $F(S'(x)) = S(F(x))$ for all $x$ in $P'$ We must show that $F$ is one-one and from $P'$ onto $\mathbb{N}$ , first lets  show that $F$ is onto by induction on $\mathbb{N}$ . Let $\mathscr{R}(F)$ be the range of $F$ . We have that $1 \in \mathscr{R}(F)$ , since $F(1') = 1$ . Now assume $x \in \mathscr{R}(F)$ thus $(\exists u)(u \in P' \land x = F(u))$ and as $S$ is closed under $\mathbb{N} $ we have S(x) defined: $$S(x) = S(F(u))$$ and by definition of $F$ it follows $$S(x) = F(S'(u))$$ Thus we have $\mathscr{R}(F) \subseteq \mathbb{N} \land 1 \in \mathscr{R}(F)$ and we have shown that $x \in \mathscr{R}(F) \Rightarrow S(x) \in \mathscr{R}(F)$ , therefore by Mathematical induction on $\mathbb{N}$ we have that $\mathscr{R}(F) = \mathbb{N}$ , thus we got $F: P' \xrightarrow[onto]{}  \mathbb{N}$ Now we must show that $F$ is one-one, the first thing I notice is that if $F$ is from $P'$ onto $\mathbb{N}$ is must have at least one restriction $F'$ of $F$ where $F'$ is one-one, by the nature of the Iteration Theorem if we peek some element $x$ from $P'$ we have that $F(S'(x)) = S(F(x))$ , but it we take $F(S'(S'(x)))$ we got first $S(F(S'(x))$ from which follows $S(S(F(x))$ not matter how many times we repeat this proccess we will have distinct objects because the nature of successor operation on $\mathbb{N}$ , lets denote the $n$ applications of $S'$ to some $x$ by $S'^n(x)$ and $n$ applications of $S$ to $x$ by $S^n(x)$ , therefore we can write $F(S'^n(x)) = S^n(F(x))$ . From this we can see that for any $a,b \in \mathbb{N}$ and some $x \in P'$ we have that $a \neq b \Rightarrow F(S'^a(x)) \neq F(S'^b(x))$ from which follows $a \neq b \Rightarrow S'^a(x) \neq S'^b(x)$ . Now for any $x \in P'$ let $P_x = \{y : y \in P' \land n \in \mathbb{N} \land (y = S'^n(x) \lor y=x) \}$ , thus let $x=1$ in this definition and we will have $$P_{1'} = \{y : y \in P' \land n \in \mathbb{N} \land (y = S'^n(1') \lor y=1') \}$$ Now let $F$ be restricted to $F': P_{1'}\rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ , we can prove that $F'$ is onto in the same way that was done before and as all elements in $P_{1'}$ is obtained from a successive applications of $S'$ to $1'$ it follows that $F'$ is one-one because $a,b \in \mathbb{N}$ we have that $a \neq b \Rightarrow F(S'^a(1')) \neq F(S'^b(1'))$ , therefore we have $F':P_{1'} \xrightarrow[onto]{1-1} \mathbb{N}.$ Now I suppose its possible to show that $F'=F$ or in other way that $P_{1'} = P'$ because it will prove that exists an isomorphism between $(P',S',1')$ and $(\mathbb{N}, S, 1)$ from which will follows that (P',S',1') is Peano system. I tried to show those both but I failed in all attempts and its not worth to put what  tried at this part because I dont get any useful conclusions, thus I moved to the another approach where I dont make much progress but at least I got some useful things about singulary operation $S'$ . From now I will just show two useful properties that $S'$ must have considering the function $F:P' \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ established before using the Iteration Theorem. $(\forall x)(S'(x) \neq 1')$ First assume $1'$ is in the range of $S$ , thus $1' = S'(u)$ for some $u \in P'$ , from which follows: $$F(1') = F(S'(u))$$ but as F(1') = 1 and F(S'(u)) = S(F(u)) we got $$1 = S(F(u))$$ , which is a contradiction because by Axiom (P1) on $(\mathbb{N},S,1)$ $1$ is not a successor, therefore $1'$ is not in the range of $S'$ , if we suppose $S'$ will act as a sucessor operation on $P'$ this show that Axiom (P1) holds true for $(P',S',1')$ . $(\forall x)(x \neq S'(x))$ Assume $S'(x) = x$ , thus F(S'(x)) = F(x), from which follows S(F(x)) = F(x), which is a contradiction on $(\mathbb{N},S,1)$ because no one natural number is its own sucessor, therefore we have $x \neq S'(x)$ for all $x$ in $P'$ . Thats all I tried and managed to do, I think if its possible to prove that $S'$ is one-one it will be possible to prove that $F$ is one-one too and finish this proof without going along all Peano Axioms in the second apporach, but when if $S'$ is proved to be one-one, the only axiom which will be needed to prove is the Mathematical Induction. Im not certain that those approach can really work in that case, so any feedback is welcome, and another approaches too, but I will like if some of those can be finished or corrected.","You can skip the first section(hints and useful things) if you want, I will keep editing this along I got more findings related to the question.

Now for any let , thus let in this definition and we will have Now let be restricted to , we can prove that is onto in the same way that was done before and as all elements in is obtained from a successive applications of to it follows that is one-one because we have that , therefore we have Now I suppose its possible to show that or in other way that because it will prove that exists an isomorphism between and from which will follows that (P',S',1') is Peano system. I tried to show those both but I failed in all attempts and its not worth to put what  tried at this part because I dont get any useful conclusions, thus I moved to the another approach where I dont make much progress but at least I got some useful things about singulary operation . From now I will just show two useful properties that must have considering the function established before using the Iteration Theorem. First assume is in the range of , thus for some , from which follows: but as F(1') = 1 and F(S'(u)) = S(F(u)) we got , which is a contradiction because by Axiom (P1) on is not a successor, therefore is not in the range of , if we suppose will act as a sucessor operation on this show that Axiom (P1) holds true for . Assume , thus F(S'(x)) = F(x), from which follows S(F(x)) = F(x), which is a contradiction on because no one natural number is its own sucessor, therefore we have for all in . Thats all I tried and managed to do, I think if its possible to prove that is one-one it will be possible to prove that is one-one too and finish this proof without going along all Peano Axioms in the second apporach, but when if is proved to be one-one, the only axiom which will be needed to prove is the Mathematical Induction. Im not certain that those approach can really work in that case, so any feedback is welcome, and another approaches too, but I will like if some of those can be finished or corrected.","(N,S,1) \text{ is a Peano system} \Leftrightarrow (N,S,1) \text{ satisfies the Homomorphism Theorem} (\mathbb{N},0,S) (P,S,1) 1 \in P S:P\rightarrow P (P,S,1) W c W g W F:P\rightarrow W F(1)=c F(S(x)) = g(F(x)) x P P 1 P S P 1 S(x) x P (\forall x)(S(x) \neq 1) P (\forall x)(\forall y)(x \neq y \Rightarrow S(x) \neq S(y)) P 1 S P (\forall B)([B \subseteq P \land 1 \in B \land (\forall x)(x \in B \Rightarrow S(x) \in B)] \Rightarrow P=B) P S 1 (P,S,1).

Rudin later goes on to say, ""For two finite sets $A$ and $B$ , we evidently have $A\sim B$ if and only if $A$ and $B$ contain the same number of elements."" Rudin never defines what cardinal or ordinal numbers are (even though he says $A\sim B$ for finite sets means $A$ and $B$ have the same cardinal number...he never defines a cardinal number) and does not go into set theory in any real depth. Curiosity: I was thinking about Rudin's statement about finite sets and was wondering how one might prove that. I read an alleged proof in Raffi Grinberg's Real Analysis Lifesaver book (a book I really do not like to be honest), and I'm really questioning whether or not it is accurate. It is reproduced below: Raffi's proof: Let $A$ and $B$ be finite sets. We claim that $A\sim B$ if and only if $A$ and $B$ have the same number of elements. If $A\sim B$ , then there exists a function that maps every element of $A$ (since $f$ is a well-defined function) to at most one element of $B$ (since $f$ is injective), and every element of $B$ is mapped to by some element of $A$ (since $f$ is surjective). So for every element of $A$ there is a corresponding element of $B$ , and all elements of $B$ are covered by this correspondence, so $A$ and $B$ must have the same number of elements. If $A$ and $B$ have the same number $n$ of elements, then we can write the sets as $A=\{a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n\}$ and $B=\{b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_n\}$ . Let $f\colon A\to B$ be defined as $f\colon a_i\mapsto b_i$ , for every $1\leq i\leq n$ . Then $f$ is a one-to-one, onto function, so $f$ is a bijection. We have found a bijection $A\to B$ , so $A\sim B$ . Question: Is this proof really correct? It seems hand-wavy at best, especially the first part (the forward direction)---the finiteness of $A$ and $B$ do not seem to matter. The same argument would seem to work in the case of infinite sets $\mathbb N$ and $\mathbb Z$ , where $\mathbb N\sim\mathbb Z$ , but we do not think of these sets as having the same number of elements in the manner argued above (do we?). More concerning, since Grinberg admits in the introduction/preface that his book is basically based on Rudin's, I wonder how he proposes to prove something about cardinal numbers (i.e., that equivalent finite sets have the same cardinal number) when they have not actually been defined (in his book or in Rudin's). I was reading in Enderton's Elements of Set Theory that, ""Now it turns out that there is no way of defining $\operatorname{card} A$ that is really simple"" (p. 136). He later gives the definition: ""For any set $A$ , define the cardinal number of $A$ ( $\operatorname{card} A$ ) to be the least ordinal equinumerous to $A$ "" (p. 197). Ultimately, there seems to be a fair amount going on here (to a novice like me at least), but I did not find Grinberg's proof very convincing. Am I wrong to feel that way? Is there an easy fix?

We define a partial order $<$ on $Y$ by $$(A_1,f_1) < (A_2,f_2) \iff A_1 \subseteq A_2 \text{ and } f_1\subseteq f_2$$ Since $X$ is infinite, there exists $A\subseteq X$ such that $A \sim \Bbb N$ (Here we assume Axiom of Countable Choice). Thus $A\times \Bbb N\sim \Bbb N\times \Bbb N\sim \Bbb N\sim A$. Hence there exists a bijection $f:A\to A\times \Bbb N$ and consequently $f\in Y$. Hence $Y\neq\emptyset$. Let $Z$ be a chain in $Y$, $F=\{f \mid \exists A \in\mathcal{P}(X),(A,f)\in Z\}$, and $f^\ast=\bigcup\limits_{f\in F}f$. $f^\ast$ is a mapping For $(a,x_1),(a,x_2)\in f^\ast$. Then there exists $(A_1,f_1),(A_2,f_2) \in Z$ such that $(a,x_1)\in f_1$ and $(a,x_2)\in f_2$. Since $Z$ is a chain, we can safely assume $(A_1,f_1) < (A_2,f_2)$. It follows that $f_1 \subseteq f_2$. Thus $(a,x_1),(a,x_2)\in f_2$ and consequently $x_1=x_2$ by the fact that $f_2$ is a mapping. Let $A^\ast=\operatorname{dom}f^\ast$. Then $A^\ast=\bigcup\limits_{f\in F} \operatorname{dom}f$. $\operatorname{ran}f^\ast=A^\ast\times\Bbb N$ For all $f\in F$, $f$ is a bijection from $\operatorname{dom}f$ to $\operatorname{dom}f\times\Bbb N$, and thus $\operatorname{ran}f = \operatorname{dom}f\times\Bbb N$. $\operatorname{ran}f^\ast=\bigcup\limits_{f\in F} \operatorname{ran}f =\bigcup\limits_{f\in F} (\operatorname{dom}f\times\Bbb N)=(\bigcup\limits_{f\in F} \operatorname{dom}f)\times\Bbb N=\operatorname{dom}f^\ast\times\Bbb N=A^\ast\times\Bbb N$. $f^\ast$ is injective Assume $(a_1,x),(a_2,x)\in f^\ast$.

To sum up, $f^\ast:A^\ast\to A^\ast\times\Bbb N$ is bijective and hence $f^\ast \in Y$. Furthermore, $f^\ast$ is an upper bound of $Z$ by definition. Thus $Y$ satisfies the requirement of Zorn's Lemma and hence has a maximal element $(\bar{A},\bar{f})$. $X\sim X\times\Bbb N$ First, I will prove that $X\sim\bar{A}$. If not, then $X\setminus \bar{A}$ is infinite and consequently there exists $C\subseteq X\setminus \bar{A}$ such that $C\sim \Bbb N$. Thus there exists a bijection $\underline f:C \to C\times\Bbb N$. Hence $g=\bar{f} \cup \underline f$ is a bijection from $\bar{A}\cup C$ to $(\bar{A}\times\Bbb N)\cup (C\times\Bbb N)=(\bar{A}\cup C)\times \Bbb N$ since $C\cap \bar{A}=\emptyset$. Thus, $g:\bar{A}\cup C\to (\bar{A}\cup C)\times \Bbb N$ is bijective and $\bar{f}\subsetneq g$. This contradicts the maximality of $(\bar{A},\bar{f})$.

Thus $B_k \cap B_{m-1} =\varnothing \space \forall m-1 \neq k \implies g[B_k] \cap g[B_{m-1}] =\varnothing \space \forall m \neq k+1$ [Since $g$ is injective] $\implies A_{k+1} \cap A_m = \varnothing \space \forall m \neq k+1$. Similarly, $B_{k+1} \cap B_m = \varnothing \space \forall m \neq k+1$. Thus $k+1 \in T$. By principle of induction, $T=\mathbb N$. $f:A' \to B'$ is bijective If $a\in A'$, then $f(a) \in f(A\setminus\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb N}A_n)=f(A)\setminus\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb N}f(A_n)$ [Since $f$ is injective] $=(B\setminus B_0)\setminus \bigcup_{n\in\mathbb N}B_{n+1}=B\setminus (B_0 \cup \bigcup_{n\in\mathbb N}B_{n+1})=B\setminus \bigcup_{n\in\mathbb N}B_n=B'$.

Since each of the functions $h$ and $k$ is defined either on all of $J$ or on some section of $J$ and since $\alpha$ is in both domains, therefore we can conclude that both $h$ and $k$ are defined on the section  $S_\alpha$ of $J$ by $\alpha$. [Am I right?] And since $\alpha$ is the smallest element common to the domains of $h$ and $k$ at which these two functions differ, we can also conclude that $h(x) = k(x)$ for all $x \in S_\alpha$, and therefore    $$ h \left( S_\alpha \right) = k \left( S_\alpha \right). \tag{1} $$   Now as both $h$ and $k$ satisfy (*), so we can conclude from (1) that    $$ h( \alpha ) = \mathrm{smallest} \left[ C - h \left( S_\alpha \right) \right] = \mathrm{smallest} \left[ C - k \left( S_\alpha \right) \right] = k( \alpha), $$   which contradicts our choice of $\alpha$. Hence the functions $h$ and $k$ coincide on the common part of their domains, as required. Is this proof correct and clear enough? If not, then where are the problems in it? Part (b): Suppose that, for some $\alpha \in J$, there exists a function $h \colon S_\alpha \to C$ satisfying (*). Then, according to the hypothesis of this theorem, this function $h$ cannot be surjective. So the set $h \left( S_\alpha \right)$ is a proper subset of $C$, and therefore the set $C - h \left( S_\alpha \right)$, being a non-empty subset of the well-ordered set $C$, must have a smallest element. Now let the function $k \colon S_\alpha \cup \{ \alpha \} \to C$ be defined as follows: $$ k(x) = \begin{cases} h(x) \ & \mbox{ if } x \in S_\alpha, \\ \mathrm{smallest} \left[ C - h \left( S_\alpha \right) \right] \ & \mbox{ if } x = \alpha. \end{cases} $$    Then $k$ also satisfies (*). [Am I right?] Is this proof correct and clear enough too? If not, then where are the issues? Part (c): Suppsoe $K \subset J$ and suppose that for each $\alpha \in K$ there exists a function $h_\alpha \colon S_\alpha \to C$ satisfying (*). We assume that our set $K$ is non-empty. Let $x$ be an arbitrary element of $\bigcup_{\alpha \in K} S_\alpha$. Then there exists at least one $\alpha \in K$ such that $x \in S_\alpha$. Suppoes that $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are any two distinct elements of $K$ such that $x \in S_\alpha \cap S_\beta$. As $\alpha, \beta \in J$ and as $J$ is a simply ordered set, so either $\alpha < \beta$ or $\beta < \alpha$. We assume without loss of generality that $\alpha < \beta$. Then $S_\alpha \cap S_\beta = S_\alpha$. So by Part (a) we can conclude that    $$ h_\beta (x) = h_\alpha(x). \tag{2} $$   Now let $K_x$ be the subset of $K$ consisting of all the elements $\alpha \in K$ such that $x \in S_\alpha$; that is, let    $$ K_x \colon= \left\{ \ \alpha \in K \ \colon \ x \in S_\alpha \ \right\}. \tag{3} $$    Then $K_x$, being a non-empty subset of $K$ and hence of $J$, has a smallest element $\alpha_x$, say. Hence using the same reasoning as the one used in arriving at (2) we can conclude that    $$ h_\alpha(x) = h_{\alpha_x}(x) \ \mbox{ for all } \alpha \in K_x. \tag{4} $$ Now let $k \colon \bigcup_{ \alpha \in K} S_\alpha \to C$ be the function defined by the formula    $$ k(x) = h_{\alpha_x}(x) \ \mbox{ for all } x \in \bigcup_{\alpha \in K} S_\alpha, \tag{5} $$   where $\alpha_x$ is the smallest element of the set $K_x$ in (3) above. Now we show that this function $k$ also satisfies (*). For any point $x \in \bigcup_{\alpha \in K} S_\alpha$, we note that, if $\alpha_x$ is the smallest element in $K$ such that $x \in S_{\alpha_x}$, then    $k(x) = h_{\alpha_x}(x)$. Let us fix an element $x \in \bigcup_{\alpha \in K} S_\alpha$. Now let us take any element  $v \in S_{x}$. Then $v \in J$ and $v < x <  \alpha_x$, and we also have $\alpha_v \leq \alpha_x$, where $\alpha_v$ is the smallest element of the set $K_v$ as defined in (3) above, which in turn implies that $S_{\alpha_v} \subset S_{\alpha_x}$ and so  using (a) we can also conclude that    $$   h_{\alpha_x}(v) = h_{\alpha_v}(v) = k(v).   $$   That is,    $$ k(v) = h_{\alpha_x}(v) \ \mbox{ for all } v \in S_{x}.  $$   Therefore we can conclude that   $$ k \left( S_{x} \right) = h_{\alpha_x} \left( S_{x} \right),  \tag{6} $$   and hence    $$ k(x) = h_{\alpha_x}(x) = \mathrm{smallest} \left[ C - h_{\alpha_x} \left( S_x \right) \right] = \mathrm{smallest} \left[ C - k \left( S_x \right) \right]. $$   Thus our function $k$ also satisfies (*).

If someone could take a moment and see if there is a flaw in it, I'd appreciate it. Lemma. There are no natural numbers less than $1$. Proof. Assume to the contrary that there are natural numbers less than $1$ and let $S$ consist of these numbers. By assumption, $S \neq \varnothing$ and $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, so by the well ordering principle, the natural number $m = \min{S}$ exists such that $$ 0 < m < 1$$ If we multiply the above inequality by $m$, we get $$0 < m^2 < m < 1$$ We see that $m^2$ is a natural number and it is less than $1$, so it belongs to $S$. But $m^2 < m$, which is a contradiction. Hence, there are no natural numbers less than $1$. $\blacksquare$ Theorem. If $m$ and $n$ are integers with $m < n$, then $m \leq n-1$. Proof. Assume to the contrary that $n-1 < m$. Then $$n-1 < m < n$$ We observe that the length of this interval $(n-1, n)$ is $1$.

Then because $\mathbb{Z}$ is closed under addition and multiplication, and because $\mathcal{l_1},\mathcal{l_2} > 0$, we see that $\mathcal{l_1}, \mathcal{l_2} \in \mathbb{N}.$ However, $\mathcal{l_1} + \mathcal{l_2} = 1$, so we must have $$0<\mathcal{l_1} < 1 \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \text{and} \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace 0<\mathcal{l_2} < 1$$ which contradict the above lemma that there are no natural numbers less than $1$.

One could guess and check, but I'm thinking about a systematic procedure to find these sets.","I'm working within the axioms of $\mathbf{ZF}$, and we're only considering sets made out of the empty set, $\emptyset$. One could try out simple cases, and see that $  \{\emptyset\}$ and $ \{ \emptyset, \{\emptyset \}\}$ satisfy $\mathscr{P}(\bigcup A) \subseteq A$. But how could one prove that these are the only cases, and no other sets fulfill the condition?

97,Is there a name for an equation in which different variables are multiplied together? e.g. $xz+2x-5yx=21$,Is there a name for an equation in which different variables are multiplied together? e.g.,xz+2x-5yx=21,"This is quite a simple question I suppose, but i'm trying to categorise equation types in my mind. From what I know, linear equations can have any number of variables in them, but in each term there is only one variable e.g. $w+2x-3y+4z=5$ And quadratics have the highest power of any variable in a term having a power of two: e.g. $x^2+2y-3=0$ But when it comes to equations such as $xy+x-2=0$ and $3xy^2-9x+4=0$, are these referred to as quadratics and cubics respectively because of the highest number of variables multiplied together in any one term? Or perhaps I am thinking about this in the wrong way and there is simply the set of all equations (within which all of the above fall), and there exist subsets of equatios with specific names/categories (e.g. one subset could be 'equations in only one variable' which is formed of the sets 'linear equations', 'quadratics', 'cubics' etc; and another subset could be 'equations in more than one variable but in which each term contains only one variable' in which the subsets are just named y the highest power of any term in the equation i.e. 'linear', 'quadratic' etc...)
