33,Linear approximation for an area between three circles,Linear approximation for an area between three circles,,"I want to compute the area of a set bounded by three circles. Let $x,y \in [0,1]$, and $\theta \in [0,\pi]$, and consider the three disks $D_1, D_2, D_3$ with unit radius, and centers at the points $(0,0), (x,0), (y \cos \theta, y \sin \theta)$, respectively. What is $A_\theta(x,y) = area(D_1 \cap D_2^c \cap D_3^c)$? (The set $D_1 \cap D_2^c \cap D_3^c = D_1 \setminus (D_2 \cup D_3)$ is an intersection of two crescent shapes.) It probably isn't possible to give a 'nice' formula for the area in terms of $x,y,$ and $\theta$: all I really care about is a linear approximation for $A_\theta(x,y)$ as a function of $x$ and $y$ as $x,y \to 0$, for fixed $\theta$. I suspect it should have the form ($\star$) $A_\theta(x,y) = c_1(\theta) x + c_2(\theta) y + O(xy, x^2, y^2).$ and I would like to know $c_1$ and $c_2$. Even if $c_1$ and $c_2$ can't be computed, I would still like to know if the Taylor series does have the form $(\star)$, or if not, determine what form it should have. As an example, one can easily compute the area of a single 'crescent' $D_1 \cap D_2^c$: it essentially comes down to computing the area of intersection of two circles whose radii are $x$ apart. (The set $D_1 \cap D_2^c$ is the crescent shaped region outside the unit disk $D_1$ and inside the shifted disk $D_2$.) This yields $area(D_1 \cap D_2^c) = \pi-2\arccos(x/2)+\frac{x}{2}\sqrt{4-x^2} = 2x - \frac{x^3}{12} + O(x^5)$ as $x \to 0$. I can only handle the two trivial cases right now: when $\theta = \pi$, some simple estimates yield the bound $A_\pi(x,y) \leq 4 \sqrt{2} \max(x,y)^3$, so in that case $c_1 = c_2 = 0$, and $A$ decays faster than linearly as $x,y \to 0$. When $\theta = 0$, the intersection reduces to the case above (with just 2 circles), and the area is just $A_0(x,y) = 2 \min(x,y) + O(\min(x,y)^3)$. I know there are formulas out there for intersections of multiple circles, but so far I've found them too general to apply here. Understanding the set analytically just seems too difficult right now: I can't even get a reasonable expression for the intersection point of the two circles $D_2$ and $D_3$ in terms of $x,y,$ and $\theta$. I think there may be hope in somehow dividing the intersection into two parts: one bounded by $D_1$ and $D_2$, and the other bounded by  $D_1$ and $D_3$, and analyzing these separately. But I haven't got that to work yet. Edit: Added a picture for clarity. The shaded region is what I'm interested in.","I want to compute the area of a set bounded by three circles. Let $x,y \in [0,1]$, and $\theta \in [0,\pi]$, and consider the three disks $D_1, D_2, D_3$ with unit radius, and centers at the points $(0,0), (x,0), (y \cos \theta, y \sin \theta)$, respectively. What is $A_\theta(x,y) = area(D_1 \cap D_2^c \cap D_3^c)$? (The set $D_1 \cap D_2^c \cap D_3^c = D_1 \setminus (D_2 \cup D_3)$ is an intersection of two crescent shapes.) It probably isn't possible to give a 'nice' formula for the area in terms of $x,y,$ and $\theta$: all I really care about is a linear approximation for $A_\theta(x,y)$ as a function of $x$ and $y$ as $x,y \to 0$, for fixed $\theta$. I suspect it should have the form ($\star$) $A_\theta(x,y) = c_1(\theta) x + c_2(\theta) y + O(xy, x^2, y^2).$ and I would like to know $c_1$ and $c_2$. Even if $c_1$ and $c_2$ can't be computed, I would still like to know if the Taylor series does have the form $(\star)$, or if not, determine what form it should have. As an example, one can easily compute the area of a single 'crescent' $D_1 \cap D_2^c$: it essentially comes down to computing the area of intersection of two circles whose radii are $x$ apart. (The set $D_1 \cap D_2^c$ is the crescent shaped region outside the unit disk $D_1$ and inside the shifted disk $D_2$.) This yields $area(D_1 \cap D_2^c) = \pi-2\arccos(x/2)+\frac{x}{2}\sqrt{4-x^2} = 2x - \frac{x^3}{12} + O(x^5)$ as $x \to 0$. I can only handle the two trivial cases right now: when $\theta = \pi$, some simple estimates yield the bound $A_\pi(x,y) \leq 4 \sqrt{2} \max(x,y)^3$, so in that case $c_1 = c_2 = 0$, and $A$ decays faster than linearly as $x,y \to 0$. When $\theta = 0$, the intersection reduces to the case above (with just 2 circles), and the area is just $A_0(x,y) = 2 \min(x,y) + O(\min(x,y)^3)$. I know there are formulas out there for intersections of multiple circles, but so far I've found them too general to apply here.

39,Surface Area of a Lemon,Surface Area of a Lemon,,"I'm a high school senior doing the AP Calc course, and recently I studied surface area of revolutions. As background research for a class project, I tried to look for things found in nature that roughly involve revolutions, and shortlisted eggs and lemons. But eggs were already analysed, and lemons seemed more challenging. So now I'm trying to find an approximation for the surface area of a lemon. From research, I've found that a lemon takes the approximate shape of a prolate spheroid. This is what that shape looks like: I know that the equation for the surface area of revolution is: $S = 2\pi\int_a^b f(x)\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^2} \,dx$ I can try finding the side profile of a lemon, model it into a function, and then apply the equation above from 0 to pi. However, this doesn't look like the best way to me, because I'm not sure how to find an equation to describe a lemon's shape. Plus, the lemons in different countries, such as India, are of a different shape. I'm looking for a different way to model the equation describing a lemon's cross-sectional shape. My knowledge about elliptic integrals is limited, but I'm willing to do research to find a way which involves mathematics beyond my high-school level. [Update] After research, I realized rather than going for an ellipse rotated around the axis, I could go for a lens shape too. A bulbous lens might approximate the ends of the lemon too.","I'm a high school senior doing the AP Calc course, and recently I studied surface area of revolutions.

43,High School Projectile Motion and Quadratics,High School Projectile Motion and Quadratics,,"High school students are learning about the basics of solving quadratics and trigonometric ratios, including trigonometric inverses. The eventual goal of their project is to be able to show a reasonable firing solution, given in initial angle $\theta$ and initial velocity $v_0$. Projectile motion is given by $$y=\left(\tan{\theta}\right)x-\left(\frac{g}{2v_0^2\cos^2{\theta}}\right)x^2$$ where $x$ and $y$ are horizontal and vertical displacement. In this equation, one might change $\theta$ or $v_0$ and the equation behaves as expected - allowing students to directly give a reasonable solution. My goal is to find a way to help my students build up understanding from basic quadratics, which appear like a trajectory in shape, to a more accurate representation of trajectory given by the equation above. Since the trajectory equation is quadratic in nature and can be reduced to $ax+bx^2$, and because students will also learn trigonometric ratios, this is reasonable. Note that I am giving the context because the answer needs to be at a relatively low level, and I also hope that someone might have a contribution for the approach. Students initially create quadratics that look like projectile motion using quadratics of the form $y=-x(x-a)$. This gives a nice way to discuss solutions (the impact point) using the zero product property. We build up to $ax^2 +bx+c$ form, now discussing other ways to find solutions. Then I ask students to convert this equation to an initial angle and velocity (after discussion of what a firing solution might constitute). They realize quickly that such an equation doesn't make a lot of necessary information very obvious - eg, gravity, angle, velocity, etc. While we eventually discuss the trajectory motion equation (sadly, I haven't discovered how to build this in a way high school geometry students understand), we initially account for gravity using the equation $$h(t)=\frac{1}{2}gt^2+v_{0,y} t+h_0$$ where $t$ is time in seconds, $g$ is acceleration due to gravity, and $h(t)$ is height in meters, and $v_{0,y}$ is initial $y$ velocity. My question is: can $h(t)$ be modified with a particular initial angle $\theta$ and initial velocity $v_0$? My suspicion is that the answer to this question will look like the parameterized version of the trajectory equation.","High school students are learning about the basics of solving quadratics and trigonometric ratios, including trigonometric inverses.

The robot is equipped with a camera/servo combination which is used to uniquely identify columns with known positions which sit outside of the board that the robot can move on. The robot (R) can determine the angles between itself and any post (A, B, C, etc) via computer vision and measurement of the servo value that rotates the camera. It cannot determine the distance from itself to any post, but it knows the location (and therefore distances, angles) between any posts. This is a priori knowledge of the board that is programmed into the robot. For a single triangle formed by ABR, it does not seem to be intuitively possible to locate a robot, because only one angle (R), and one distance (AB) is known. Thinking that we could solve the problem by including more points, we tried including BCR. This seems to intuitively provide enough points to definitely locate a robot, but the math we have done does not point to a single answer. This could be due to real-world assumptions that we have not been able to put in an equation form.

88,Relation between $SO(n)$ and rotations,Relation between  and rotations,SO(n),"We often consider $SO(n)$ as the group of rotations in $\mathbb{R}^n$ in the sense that the usual action of $SO(n)$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ by matrix multiplication can be interpreted as a rotation operation in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Although I've always used this fact, I never had an intuitive understanding of why is that. Basically, we know that the linear transformation associated to a matrix $A$ is inner product preserving if and only if $A\in O(n)$. In truth, if $A\in O(n)$ then we know that $AA^T = I$ and hence $$\langle Ax, Ay\rangle=\langle x, A^TA y\rangle = \langle x,y\rangle , \quad \forall x,y\in \mathbb{R}^n.$$ Furthermore, if $A$ is inner product preserving, then $A\in O(n)$. Then we have two possible choices, $\det(A) = +1$ and so $A\in SO(n)$ and $\det(A) = -1$ and $A\in O(n)\setminus SO(n)$. In that case, an element of $SO(n)$ is simply one inner product preserving linear transformation, that is, which doesn't change angles nor lengths, and which has determinant $+1$. Now, from this rigorous definition of the elements of $SO(n)$ how can one see that the elements of $SO(n)$ can be though of as rotation operators?

The goal is to find the bounds of that integral which yields 5,000 cm^3 Ok, I got the 14 point star equation to work in MATLAB: But, the volume that was put out was about half of what was expected.  This lead me to look deeper into this and I have now learned that the solution I am looking for is a 26-point star.  I have started a new question for this. Can someone give me the spherical equation for a 26 point star? I appreciate all the help.",,"['geometry', 'algebraic-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"
97,Trying to understand the limit of regular polygons: circle vs apeirogon (vs infinigon?),Trying to understand the limit of regular polygons: circle vs apeirogon (vs infinigon?),,"In the definition of regular polygon at the Wikipedia, there is this statement about the limit of a n-gon: ""In the limit, a sequence of regular polygons with an increasing number of sides becomes a circle, if the perimeter is fixed, or a regular apeirogon, if the edge length is fixed."" My question is: I am trying to understand how to imagine an apeirogon versus a circle, but that definition (regarding edge length) and the visual representation found in the Wikipedia or Wolfram is not very clear to me. Indeed looking for information in other websites, I found also something called "" infinigon "", but it seems that there is not formal definition (or I did not find it). This topic could be very basic but I did not find former questions at MSE, and I am interested in understand the difference. Thank you!","In the definition of regular polygon at the Wikipedia, there is this statement about the limit of a n-gon: ""In the limit, a sequence of regular polygons with an increasing number of sides becomes a circle, if the perimeter is fixed, or a regular apeirogon, if the edge length is fixed.""

98,Compute ratio of a rectangle seen from an unknown perspective,Compute ratio of a rectangle seen from an unknown perspective,,"TL;DR: Given 4 points on a two dimentional plane, representing a reclangle seen from an unknown perspective, can we deduce the width / height ratio of the rectangle ? Details: From a picture, and some opencv work (canny, hough lines, bucketing to tell appart ""lines"" and ""columns"", choosing interesting lines, math to deduce lines intersections), I get this: From this step, it's easy to warp it to a ""from the top"" view, using opencv getPerspectiveTransform and wrapPerspective to ""remove"" the perspective, being on the top of the rectangle. My goal now is to keep the aspect ratio of it, as I loose it while doing my actual warping, because I don't know the ratio it should have. For this I have to give to getPerspectiveTransform the 4 destination points where I want my 4 found red points to be after warping, not just 4 random points like (0, 0), (0, 100), (100, 100), (100, 0) leading to a deformation if my 4 red points are not a square. So is there a known way to compute the width/height ratio, or even better the size, of this ""seen thrue a perspective rectangle"" ? For the record and the curious, work-in-progress is here: https://github.com/JulienPalard/grid-finder","TL;DR: Given 4 points on a two dimentional plane, representing a reclangle seen from an unknown perspective, can we deduce the width / height ratio of the rectangle ?

99,Graham scan with collinear points,Graham scan with collinear points,,"I'm having some trouble understanding the Graham scan algorithm as described in Wikipedia . Particularly, I don't understand how to handle collinear points. Consider these points as a simple example: (3, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) Plotted into a coordinate system, they look like this: According to my interpretation of the Graham scan, I first need to find the point P with the lowest y coordinate (and lowest x in case of identical y coordinates). As far as I can tell, that point is (3, 1) . Next, I need to order the other points ""in increasing order of the angle they and the point P make with the x-axis"". As far as I can tell, the correct order should be: (3, 1) (3, 7) (2, 5) (2, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (1, 2) The next step is to consider whether triplets of points constitute a left or right turn. Starting with (3, 1), (3, 7), (2, 5), these make a left turn, so I should keep all three: (3, 1), (3, 7), (2, 5) Moving on to (3, 7), (2, 5), (2, 4), they also make a left turn, so keep all four: (3, 1), (3, 7), (2, 5), (2, 4) Next: (2, 5), (2, 4), (1, 6): Right turn, so discard (2, 4). Current points: (3, 1), (3, 7), (2, 5), (1, 6). This isn't right. (2, 5) isn't part of the convex hull - not even of the current subset of points considered so far.
