I have a question about Theorem 5.4 added below. I think I understand the construction of Bernstein sets, and also the main line of the Proof. My question is mush more basic I think: Suppose that every measurable subset of either $B$ or $B'$ is a Nullset, and any subset of $B$ or $B'$ that has the property of Baire is of first category. Why, Does it implies that $B$ is non-measurable? Am I missing something obvious?  Thank you for your help!!

72,Continuity of a function defined by the Lebesgue measure of a closed ball,Continuity of a function defined by the Lebesgue measure of a closed ball,,"My task is to prove that the function given by $f(x) = m(B_{x}(\alpha))$ is a continuous function, where $m(\cdot)$ denotes the Lebesgue measure and $B_{x}(\alpha)$ is a closed ball of radius $x$ centered at $\alpha$ , i.e. $$ B_x(\alpha) = \{ y \in \mathbb{R}^d \colon \Vert y-\alpha \Vert \leq x\} $$ The definition of continuity that I am using is as follows: A function $f(x)$ is continuous if for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that $\vert x - a \vert < \delta$ implies $\vert f(x) - f(a) \vert < \varepsilon$ . My main point of struggle is determining a $\delta$ that makes this all work nicely. Here is what I have currently: Proof: Let $ \vert x - a \vert < \delta - a$ . Without loss of generality, assume that $a < x$ , and so $x - a < \delta - a$ . Additionally, we may assume that $\alpha$ above equals $0$ without loss of generality. Consider any element $u \in \mathbb{R}^d$ such that $0 < \Vert u \Vert - a \leq x-a < \delta - a$ . This implies that $a < \Vert u \Vert \leq x < \delta$ . We may write the set of all possible $u$ as $$ B_x(0) \backslash B_a(0) = \{ u \in \mathbb{R}^d \colon a < \Vert u \Vert \leq x \} $$ By the properties of Lebesgue measure, we have $$m(B_x(0) \backslash B_a(0)) = m(B_x(0)) - m(B_a(0)) =  \vert m(B_x(0)) - m(B_a(0)) \vert$$ which is precisely $\vert f(x) - f(a) \vert$ . But $B_x(0) \backslash B_a(0) \subseteq B_\delta(0)$ and so $$m(B_x(0) \backslash B_a(0)) < m(B_\delta(0)) = \frac{\pi^{\frac{d}{2}}}{\Gamma(\frac{d}{2} + 1)} \delta^d$$ Hence we have $\vert f(x) - f(a) \vert < \frac{\pi^{\frac{d}{2}}}{\Gamma(\frac{d}{2} + 1)} \delta^d$ . If I have done everything else correctly, then this is where I am stuck. I am no expert when it comes to spheres of dimension $d$ but I think I have written the ""volume"" (or better yet, measure) of $B_\delta(0)$ correctly in the above semi-proof.

Proving this is not so bad starting from the definition of a convex function (iteratively break the convex combination into a convex combination between just two points and apply the definition of a convex function). For the case of general probability measures: $$f(\mathbb E X) \leq \mathbb E f(X)$$ where $X$ is a real valued random variable, the approach I know is pretty different (show that a tight affine lower bound of $f$ exists then apply linearity of expectation) but I feel that the method for the finite case could be made to work here. Here is my attempt , drawing inspiration from the construction of the Lebesgue integral: Given a real valued random variable $X$ , let $X^+,X^-$ be such that $X = X^+ - X^-$ so that it suffices to show the claim for non-negative random variables (apply the definition of convexity to the convex combination $\mathbb P [X>0] X^+ + \left(1-\mathbb P[X>0]\right) X^-$ ). Let $X_j$ be a sequence of simple random variables (defined as a finite sum of indicator functions on the sample space) dominated by $X$ such that $$\mathbb E X_j \rightarrow \sup \left\{\mathbb E Y: Y \leq X,\, Y\text{ is simple}\right\}$$ Now we have: $$f\left(\mathbb E X\right) = f\left(\mathbb E X_j + o(1)\right) = f\left(\mathbb E X_n\right) + o(1) \leq \mathbb E f\left( X_j\right) + o(1)$$ Where the first equality is by definition of the sequence $X_j$ , the second equality is from the fact that $f$ is convex and so continuous on the interior of its domain, the inequality is from the finite case of Jensen's inequality. Next, I would like to claim that $X_j \rightarrow ^p X$ and apply the continuous mapping theorem to complete the argument, but I'm not sure how to justify that claim. I could use feedback on my reasoning as well as some help justifying the last claim. EDIT: there is a simpler argument. Instead of defining $X_j$ as I have, I could instead define it as a sequence of simple random variables increasing towards $X$ pointwise (for every event in the sample space).

And ""countable transitivity"" also holds, i.e., if , , then . This is because a countable union of measure zero sets is still of measure zero. Now my question is why ""uncountable transitivity"" doesn't hold? Functions where ranges over , cannot be all in the same equivalence class. But it seems plausible to connect any two such functions by uncountably many equivalence relations. I think it might be because the equivalence relation cannot be used infinitely many times. But I'm still confused and I guess it is a little related to set theory. Could anyone say more about this?","L^p(\mathbb{R}^n) f g f\sim g f=g f\sim g g\sim h f\sim h f \sim r_1 r_1 \sim r_2 \sim r_3 \sim \cdots \sim g f\sim g \chi_{[0,s]} s [0,1] \chi_{[0,s]}, \chi_{[0,t]}","['real-analysis', 'measure-theory']"
