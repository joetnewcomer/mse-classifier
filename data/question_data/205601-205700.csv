Since any two vertices of C are connected by a path of length at most 3 on C, any additional edge with endpoints on C would create a cycle of length at most 4. Hence the third neighbor of each vertex on C is not on C. Thus there are seven edges from V(C) to the remaining three vertices. By the pigeonhole principle, one of the remaining vertices receives at least three of these edges. This vertex x not on C has three neighbors on C. For any three vertices on C, either two are adjacent or two have a common neighbor on C (again the pigeonhole principle applies). Using x, this completes a cycle of length at most 4.

For example, if $N$ = 6 and the initial sequence is $x = \begin{array}{r}\{1&0&0&0&0&0\}\end{array}$ then the output eventually cycles through the six states $x_n = \begin{array}{r}\{5,1,1,4,2,5\}\end{array}$ $x_{n+1} = \begin{array}{r}\{2,0,3,4,3,0\}\end{array}$ $x_{n+2} = \begin{array}{r}\{4,3,1,5,3,2\}\end{array}$ $x_{n+3} = \begin{array}{r}\{5,4,4,4,5,2\}\end{array}$ $x_{n+4} = \begin{array}{r}\{5,0,0,1,3,3\}\end{array}$ $x_{n+5} = \begin{array}{r}\{1,0,1,2,0,2\}\end{array}$ Since for any N the number of states is finite they will eventually repeat with a fixed period, or end up as all zeros.

The reason this is valid is that if the second half has at least 5 vertices, we can connect those to all the vertices in the first half, thus meeting the bipartite requirements.

It is known that any edge has at least one endpoint, on which no more than four other edges are incident. What is the maximum number of edges that this graph can have? No multiple edges or loops are allowed. My thoughts so far: We consider this graph to be bipartite, with one half consisting of all vertices of degree five, and the second half – remaining vertices. The reason this is valid is that if the second half has at least 5 vertices, we can connect those to all the vertices in the first half, thus meeting the bipartite requirements. In this case, the maximum number of edges is achieved when there are exactly 5 vertices in the second half: .

Given any bijection $f:[n]\times[m]\rightarrow [nm]$ , let's define its distortion as the greatest difference $|f(x_1)-f(x_2)|$ in its evaluation between two adjacent elements $x_1$ and $x_2$ of $[n]\times[m]$ where ""adjacency"" is considered that they agree in one coordinate and differ by exactly $1$ in the other coordinate. What is the minimum possible distortion of any bijection? One might consider this as something about minimizing the Lipschitz constant of a bijection between a discrete line segment and a lattice rectangle under the taxicab metric. One can constrain the answer fairly well: for a lower bound to distortion, observe that some element $x_1$ of $[n]\times [m]$ must have $f(x_1)=0$ and some $x_2$ must have $f(x_2)=nm-1$ . There has to be some path of at most $n+m-2$ points in $[n]\times [m]$ , each adjacent to the prior, connecting $x_1$ and $x_2$ . Thus, some difference along this path must be at least $\frac{nm-1}{n+m-2}$ . On the other side, one can consider the explicit bijection $f(a,b)=ma+b$ or $g(a,b)=a+nb$ to get that some bijection has distortion at most $\min(n,m)$ . There are other maps that attain this bound (e.g. you can adapt Cantor's pairing function to this finite domain to get this bound - essentially by ordering the points of the rectangle by diagonals and the filling each diagonal in in a consistent order). My guess is that this bound is optimal, although I lack a good argument to prove it. There's roughly a ratio of $2$ between the two bounds I give here in the worst case. As far as exact results, this the distortion is clearly at least $1$ for any map $[1]\times [n]\rightarrow [n]$ where $n\geq 1$ and at least $2$ for any map $[2]\times [n]\rightarrow [2n]$ where $n\geq 2$ simply due to the pigeonhole principle. One can work out that all maps $[3]\times [3]\rightarrow [9]$ (and by extension $[3]\times [n]\rightarrow [3n]$ for $n\geq 3$ ) have distortion at least $3$ by extending the lower bound argument a touch. I checked with computer that $[4]\times [4]\rightarrow [16]$ maps have distortion at least $4$ and $[5]\times [5]\rightarrow [25]$ maps have distortion at least $5$ .

I haven't been able to solve it, so I'm going to to ask it again.  PROMYS applications have closed, and I hope the effort shown below is enough to keep this question from being closed. The Mathematical Forest is grown in a two-dimensional plane, where   trees can only grow on points with integer coordinates. To start with,   there are no trees at all. The foresters plant the first tree at $(0,0)$ . Each year, they carry out tree planting according to the   following rule. If there is a tree on the point (𝑚,𝑛) but there are   no trees on the points $(m+1,n)$ and $(m,n+1)$ , then they can choose   to remove the tree on $(m,n)$ and plant new trees on the points $(m,n+1)$ and $(m+1,n)$ . For an integer $k\geq1$ , the $k$ th diagonal   consists of all points $(m,n)$ with $m+n=k−1$ . Is it possible for the   foresters to arrange their planting so that eventually there are no   trees on the first $2$ diagonals? What about the first $3$ diagonals? $4$ diagonals? Can you generalize? It's easy to get to a position with no trees on the first two diagonals.  (It only takes $4$ plantings.)  I can prove it's impossible to reach a position with no trees on the first $4$ diagonals, and I believe it's impossible to reach a position with no trees on the first $3$ diagonals, but I can't prove it. For the $k=4$ case, I used a pagoda function, as in a peg solitaire problem.  For $k=1,2,3,\dots$ define the potential of a tree on the $k$ th diagonal as $\frac1{2^{k-1}}$ , and the potential of the forest as the sum of the potentials of all the trees in it.  When a tree of potential $\frac1{2^{k-1}}$ is removed, it is replaced by $2$ trees of potential $\frac1{2^k}$ so the potential of the forest never changes.  Initially, the potential of the forest is $1$ . Since there are $k$ trees on diagonal $k$ , the potential of all points beyond the fourth diagonal is $$\sum_{k=5}^\infty\frac k{2^{k-1}}=\frac34<1,$$ so it is impossible that there are no trees on the first $4$ diagonals. The potential of the fourth diagonal is $\frac12$ , so this argument doesn't show that it's impossible to have no trees on the first $3$ diagonals.  I've done a lot of experimenting, though, and I believe that the statement is true.  (I even wrote a little computer game so I could experiment quickly.)  The best I've been able to do is to get down to one man on the third diagonal. The black circles are trees eligible for removal, and the gray circles are other trees.  You can see that there is a ""traffic jam"" in front of the lone tree on diagonal $3$ , and there seems to be no way to clear it. I've been trying to come up with an argument that reflects this traffic jam, but I haven't been at all successful. We know that after $n$ removals there are $n+1$ trees, and I've been trying to prove somehow that they can't all be sufficiently far from the origin to allow all trees to get past diagonal $3$ , but I haven't come close. In the diagram above, if the tree at $(1,1)$ were moved to $(0,2)$ , and the tree at $(1,2)$ were moved to $(2,0)$ , then it would be possible to remove the tree at $(0,2)$ , emptying the second diagonal.  In the fictitious position, we still have one tree on diagonal $2$ and two on diagonal $3$ . So, I think an argument along the lines I was trying cannot just be concerned with the distance from the origin; it must somehow take into account how the trees interfere with one another.  I haven't been able to do this. I'd be grateful for solutions, hints, or counterexamples. I wasn't really sure what tags to attach.  Please add any that seem appropriate.","This question has been asked before, at least twice by people who were trying to cheat on the PROMYS Europe 2020 Application, and once in a question closed because the OP showed no effort.

What about the first diagonals? diagonals? Can you generalize? It's easy to get to a position with no trees on the first two diagonals.  (It only takes plantings.)  I can prove it's impossible to reach a position with no trees on the first diagonals, and I believe it's impossible to reach a position with no trees on the first diagonals, but I can't prove it. For the case, I used a pagoda function, as in a peg solitaire problem.  For define the potential of a tree on the th diagonal as , and the potential of the forest as the sum of the potentials of all the trees in it.  When a tree of potential is removed, it is replaced by trees of potential so the potential of the forest never changes.  Initially, the potential of the forest is . Since there are trees on diagonal , the potential of all points beyond the fourth diagonal is so it is impossible that there are no trees on the first diagonals. The potential of the fourth diagonal is , so this argument doesn't show that it's impossible to have no trees on the first diagonals.  I've done a lot of experimenting, though, and I believe that the statement is true.  (I even wrote a little computer game so I could experiment quickly.)  The best I've been able to do is to get down to one man on the third diagonal. The black circles are trees eligible for removal, and the gray circles are other trees.  You can see that there is a ""traffic jam"" in front of the lone tree on diagonal , and there seems to be no way to clear it. I've been trying to come up with an argument that reflects this traffic jam, but I haven't been at all successful. We know that after removals there are trees, and I've been trying to prove somehow that they can't all be sufficiently far from the origin to allow all trees to get past diagonal , but I haven't come close. In the diagram above, if the tree at were moved to , and the tree at were moved to , then it would be possible to remove the tree at , emptying the second diagonal.  In the fictitious position, we still have one tree on diagonal and two on diagonal . So, I think an argument along the lines I was trying cannot just be concerned with the distance from the origin; it must somehow take into account how the trees interfere with one another.  I haven't been able to do this. I'd be grateful for solutions, hints, or counterexamples. I wasn't really sure what tags to attach.  Please add any that seem appropriate.","(0,0) (m+1,n) (m,n+1) (m,n) (m,n+1) (m+1,n) k\geq1 k (m,n) m+n=k−1 2 3 4 4 4 3 k=4 k=1,2,3,\dots k \frac1{2^{k-1}} \frac1{2^{k-1}} 2 \frac1{2^k} 1 k k \sum_{k=5}^\infty\frac k{2^{k-1}}=\frac34<1, 4 \frac12 3 3 n n+1 3 (1,1) (0,2) (1,2) (2,0) (0,2) 2 3","['discrete-mathematics', 'contest-math', 'recreational-mathematics']"

So we have a map $f : A \rightarrow [0,1]$ with $\sum_{a \in A} f(a) = 1$ . For example $(1|0,2), (2|0,3), (3,|0,1), (4|0,35), (5|0,05)$ . Let me explain my notation: $(1|0,2)$ means that the letter $a$ has frequency $0,2$ . So the Huffman code tells us that we take the two letters with the lowest frequency and combine them. So we get $(1|0,2), (2|0,3), (3,|0,15), (4|0,35)$ .

Where can I find an example of it? On the other hand, I have found the following equality and inequality, but I couldn't grasp exactly what they are saying, if someone can elaborate for me them, I would be glad. $$2 |E| = \sum_{i \geq 4} i F_i$$ where $i$ is the number of edges of the face $F_i$ and $F_i$ is the number of faces with $i$ edges. Clearly this is somehow consequence of the handshaking lemma, but why multiplying number of edges of a face with the faces give us this result? Shouldn't we use the degree of each vertex for handshaking lemma? The second inequality is this one $$4 \sum_{i \geq 4} F_i \leq \sum_{i \geq 4} i F_i$$ $$4 |F| \leq 2|E|$$ I mean, the second part is form the above equation, but first part the 4 confuses me. Is it because we need at least 4 edges for a face in bipartite graph? If yes, why do we need it actually in this inequality? Second question, why does this inequality hold?
