All I get is horribly complicated nonlinear DEs. Is there a magic substitution that makes differentiation and logarithm commute? What I'm asking for is solutions to:",\dfrac d {dx} \ln( f(x) ) = \ln\left( \dfrac d {dx} f(x) \right ),['ordinary-differential-equations']

98,Why does this formula for an integrating factor for first-order ODE work?,Why does this formula for an integrating factor for first-order ODE work?,,"The book Shaum's Outlines: Differential Equations , 3rd edition (page 33) provides the following condition (among others) for determining that a first-order ODE is amenable to solution via an integrating factor: $$ M = yf(xy) $$ and $$ N = xg(xy) $$ This is where the ODE is written as: $$ M dx + N dy = 0 $$ In this case, the integrating factor is: $$ I(x,y) = {1 \over xM - yN} $$ I am trying to figure out why this is so, and if possible, derive an explicit expression for the function whose exact differential is ${1 \over xM - yN}(M dx + N dy)$ .

I wanted to cover it and have no problems using this method for first order ODEs but upon reading the example in the notes that shows using variation of parameters to solve second order ODEs I see something that I don't understand. The example provided is: Find the general solution of $$y''+y'-2y=e^x$$ Finding the homogeneous solution is self explanatory giving: $$y=C_1(x)y_1(x)+C_2(x)y_2(x)=C_1e^{-2x} + C_2e^{x}$$ $$y'=C^{'}_1e^{-2x}-2C_1e^{-2x}+C^{'}_2e^x+C_2e^x$$ Then the example says ""...we impose on $C_1(x)$ and $C_2(x)$ a constraint:"" $$C^{'}_1e^{-2x} + C^{'}_2e^{x}=0$$ I cannot for the life of me understand why we are allowed to do this and where it comes from. I asked my lecturer and he said: With two unknown constants, we can impose two constraints on them to find a unique solution. One constraint follows from the ODE itself, leaving us the freedom to select the other constraint a convenient. And the choice of Lagrange is convenient indeed! I replied: Forgive me if it is obvious but I am still unsure as to why we know that the constraint is equal to zero – I assume it somehow follows from the ODE like you said but I cannot see how. Then finally he said: We do not KNOW that — we DECIDE to impose such a constraint because it helps to solve the problem. The other constraint follows from the equation — no independent decisions there. Unfortunately this does not make anything clearer so if anyone could help explain it to me I would be very grateful!","We never actually covered the method of variation of parameters in class as it was marked as optional so the lecturer said it's our choice whether we cover it or not.
