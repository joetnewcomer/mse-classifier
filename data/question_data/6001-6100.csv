34,The main idea behind Big O notation,The main idea behind Big O notation,,"Well, when we use Big O notation we never know even approximate number of steps of a given algorithm, right? For example, if we have $O(n)$ algorithm, then we don't know how fast this algorithm itself is: its exact number of steps may be $10n$ or even $10^{100}n$ . Thus we just put this algorithm in particular ""class of functions"" $O(n)$ . The reason for doing that is for us to be able to compare algorithms from different ""classes"". For example, we always know that $O(n)$ is going to be slower than $O(\log_2 n)$ for large $n$ , because $\lim_{n \to +\infty} \frac{\log_2 n}{n} = 0$ . But if we are told that there are two different $O(n)$ algorithms, then we can't say which one is going to be faster, right?

37,How come the $\epsilon-\delta$ definition of continuity is preferred over the sequential definition of continuity?,How come the  definition of continuity is preferred over the sequential definition of continuity?,\epsilon-\delta,"I've personally found things are a lot easier to prove using the sequences rather than the $\epsilon-\delta$ method. I do understand the $\epsilon-\delta$ is more intuitive, but it's quite difficult to prove a function is continuous on $x_0 \in D$ since it implies finding a function that takes $\epsilon$ and $x_0$ as arguments and outputs some $\delta>0$ , or at least proving such a function exists. This issue is even more prevalent when proving a function is uniformly continuous. On all of my homework problems involving uniform continuity, I always tried to use the $\epsilon-\delta$ definition, yet I always failed. When searching for the solution, the proofs are quite confusing and complex. I would then switch to the sequence definition and would succeed in solving the problem quickly. My professor says that the mathematics community nonetheless refers the $\epsilon-\delta$ definition, so I am curious why when it's a more difficult path. Here are the definitions. For a function $f:D \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ , Continuity : $f$ is continuous at $x_0 \in D$ if for any sequence $(x_n)$ in $D$ where $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} x_n=x_0$ , it follows $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} f(x_n)=f(x_0)$ . Uniform continuity: $f$ is uniformly continuous if for any sequences $(u_n),(v_n)$ in $D$ where $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} (u_n-v_n)=0$ , it follows $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}(f(u_n)-f(v_n))=0$ . An instance of this is proving the function $f:[0,1) \rightarrow \infty$ where $f(x)=\frac{1}{1-x}$ is not uniformly continuous. I found it very difficult to prove this using the $\epsilon-\delta$ definition, and the proofs I found online were quite confusing and there's definitely no way I would've come across them by myself. The sequential definition however was very simple. I simply used the sequences $u_n=1-\frac{1}{n^2}$ and $v_n=1-\frac{1}{n}$ . The differences of the sequences converge to 0, and the differences of the image of the sequences diverge to $\infty$ . $0 \not = \infty$ and therefore $f$ is not uniformly continuous. Another example is showing that any continuous function whose domain is a closed interval is uniformly continuous. There's no way I could come up with a way to prove this using the $\epsilon-\delta$ definition, but I definitely could using the sequence definition. I may be wrong, but I believe I read once that for some metric spaces, continuity and sequential continuity are not equivalent. I don't know much about that matter though, but would love to learn about it.","I've personally found things are a lot easier to prove using the sequences rather than the method.

I'm wondering if also a closed form expression for $$\int_0^\infty {J}_0(rx) \,\frac{e^{-z\sqrt{x^2+a^2}}}{\sqrt{x^2+a^2}} \, {\rm d}x$$ can be found. I tried the method Zacky applied, but it doesn't seem to work, because the appearance of error-functions complicate matters. I also tried the approach from Watson, but only converted the improper integral into a definite integral. Equation 2f (Watson, p.416) gives, while omitting the factor $t^{\mu+1}$ , for $\nu=1/2$ and $\mu=0$ $$\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2a}}\int_0^\infty J_0(bt) \, \frac{e^{-a\sqrt{t^2+z^2}}}{\sqrt{t^2+z^2}} \, {\rm d}t = \frac12 \int_0^\infty {\rm d}u \int_0^\infty {\rm d}t \, J_0(bt) \, u^{-3/2}\, e^{-\frac{a}{2}\left(u+\frac{t^2+z^2}{u}\right)} \\ =\frac14 \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{a}} \int_0^\infty \frac{{\rm d}u}{u} \, I_0\left(\frac{b^2u}{4a}\right) \, e^{-\frac{(2a^2+b^2)u}{4a}-\frac{z^2a}{2u}} $$ where the $t$ -integral can be found here . Substituting $v=\frac{b^2u}{4a}$ then gives $$=\frac14 \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{a}} \int_0^\infty \frac{{\rm d}v}{v} \, I_0(v) \, e^{-\frac{(2a^2+b^2)v}{b^2}-\frac{b^2z^2}{8v}} \, .$$ Using the representation $$I_0(v)=\frac1\pi \int_0^\pi {\rm d}\theta \, e^{-v\cos(\theta)}$$ finally yields $$=\frac{1}{\sqrt{8\pi a}} \int_0^\pi {\rm d}\theta \int_0^\infty \frac{{\rm d}v}{v} \, e^{-\frac{\left(a^2+b^2\cos^2(\theta/2)\right)2v}{b^2}-\frac{b^2z^2}{8v}} \\ \stackrel{w=\frac{\left(a^2+b^2\cos^2(\theta/2)\right)2v}{b^2}}{=} \frac{1}{\sqrt{8\pi a}} \int_0^\pi {\rm d}\theta \int_0^\infty \frac{{\rm d}w}{w} \, e^{-w-\frac{\left(z\sqrt{a^2+b^2\cos^2(\theta/2)}\right)^2}{4w}} \\ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi a}} \int_0^\pi {\rm d}\theta \, K_0\left(z\sqrt{a^2+b^2\cos^2(\theta/2)}\right)$$ resorting to this integral representation of the Bessel-K-function .","Following this link , Zacky calculated the integral It is a special case of the more general Bessel type integrals found in Watson .
