91,Is the composite of two simple radical extensions another simple radical extension?,Is the composite of two simple radical extensions another simple radical extension?,,"I encountered this (fact? Maybe I misunderstood) in a proof of a lemma in Dummit and Foote where the authors state something which (I think) implies this without proof, namely that the composition of two root extensions is another one. If what they state doesn't require that the composition of two simple radical extensions be another one, please explain why. I tried doing this in various ways, but (as the answer below suggests) this may not even be true. If so, there must be something wrong with my understanding or a way to avoid running into this supposed requirement. They also didn't prove the statement that the composite of all fields $\sigma{K}$ for $\sigma\in Aut(L/F)$ is precisely $L$ (the Galois closure) and here's my attempt to prove it with $K$ an arbitrary extension of $F$ . Denote the composite of all such fields by $E$ and consider the action of any $\tau\in Aut(L/F)$ on it. We see that any such $\tau$ sends $E$ into itself (see the edit below). And so, any $\sigma\in Aut(L/F)$ is an automorphism of the field $E$ fixing $F$ , But the number of embeddings $N$ of $E$ into an algebraic closure which contains $L$ that fix $F$ is the order of the set of cosets $\left|Aut\left(L/F\right)\right|/\left|Aut\left(L/E\right)\right|$ by the fundamental theorem. Combining these results we get, $$\frac{\left|Aut\left(L/F\right)\right|}{\left|Aut\left(L/E\right)\right|}\ge\left|Aut\left(E/F\right)\right|\ge\left|Aut\left(L/F\right)\right|$$ which (since $L/E$ is galois) leads to $$\left|Aut\left(L/E\right)\right|=\left[L:E\right]=1$$ Is this correct? Edit: Let $B_i=\left\{b_{i,1},b_{i,2},...b_{i,m}\right\}$ denote any set of elements that span $\sigma_iK$ over $F$ . Define $P=\left\{p_1,p_2,...p_s\right\}$ to be the set of all possible products of elements $b_{i,r}$ in the union $B_1 \cup B_2 \cup ...B_q$ . The set $P$ spans $E$ over $F$ . So, for arbitrary $\alpha \in E$ we have $$\alpha=\sum_{j=0}^sa_jp_j                          $$ $a_j \in F$ applying some $\tau \in Aut(L/F)$ and noting that $\tau$ fixes the $a_j$ 's, we get $$\tau\left(\alpha\right)=\sum_{j=0}^sa_j\tau\left(p_j\right)$$ Each $p_j$ is a product of $b$ 's in the union above and each $b_{i,r}$ is in some $\sigma_{i}K$ so $\tau$ sends it to an element of $\tau\sigma_{i}K$ which is an element of $E$ by definition. So, the image of a product of any number of $b$ 's will still be in $E$ since all the images are in $E$ . So, the image of $p_j$ is some $\beta$ again in $E$ which may or may not be in $P$ , but this doesn't matter since $\tau\left(\alpha\right)$ is in $E$ anyway and we started with an arbitrary $\alpha$ . Noting that $\tau$ can't send two elements to the same element since it's an automorphism of the larger field $L$ , I conclude that any such $\tau$ is an automorphism of $E$ fixing $F$ .","I encountered this (fact?

Also, in the item (c), I used the inverse system given in (b) and I built a bijection between $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ and $\varprojlim \mathbb{Z}_{p^{i}}$ , considering $\varprojlim \mathbb{Z}_{p^{i}}$ as a subgroup of $\prod_{i}\mathbb{Z}_{p^{i}}$ . Generally, this is the standard approach to problems like that. But I would like to know any other alternative approach. Thanks for the advance. Edit. I read the references in comment below, but it uses some things that the book doesn't comment on (like exact sequences, Hensel's lemma, for example). Basically, the book defines $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ as the set of formal infinite sums and proves only the necessary results to find the completion of $\mathbb{Z}$ , I mean: the book doesn't develop until now $p$ -adic theory. So, I would like to know if there is another proof.","Problem. (a) Write down explicitly the rules for addition and multiplication in . (b) Show that where is given by is a inverse system of finite rings and groups. (c) Show that (d) Show that the multiplicative group of units in is isomorphic to the direct product of with a cyclic group of order . I have no problems with (a), (b) and (c). For item (d), I dont know how to approach this problem. I take an arbitrary cylic group of order and I tried to construct a isomorphism between the groups, but it doesn't works (at least, I cannot see how to do that).
