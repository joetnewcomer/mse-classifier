Then we sum each number with its two neighbors and we get 10 sums. Which is the maximum value that can have the lowest of these sums? a) 14         b) 15         c) 16         d) 17         e) 18 My first approach has been to add up all the triplets. By doing that, I will get a number that won't change independently from the order of the numbers around the circumference. $$ (1+2+3)+(2+3+4)+(3+4+5)+\dots+(10+1+2)= \sum\limits_{n=1}^{10} 3n=165 $$ Therefore, I can deduce that the average sum of every triplet is $16.5$ which automatically discards $17$ and $18$ from being the correct answer. That's because if one of the triplets added up $17$, in order to keep the average at $16.5$, we would need some other triplet to add up less than $17$, which would imply that this triplet adding up $17$ wasn't the lowest triplet. And the same explanation would work for $18$. I can also discard $16$ because in order to keep the average at $16.5$ we would need more or half of the triplets to add up $16$.

For example, we could be given $f(x) = \frac{1 - 10x^9 + 9x^{10}}{(x - 1)^2}$, which represents $1 + 2x + 3x^2 + \cdots + 9x^8$.  We are interested, in this case, in the middle coefficient, which happens to be 5. Original Formulation The actual value can be determined by evaluating a contour integral.  This is accomplished by first multiplying $f(x)$ by $x^{-n}$.  Then, rewriting the variable $x$ as $x\cdot e^{i t}$ and finally evaluating the integral $\int_C{f(x)dt}$.  The result of all of this is the coefficient in question. The Goal I seek to find alternative formulations to this problem.  Let me give some examples. Example 1 : ""Tiling"" Start with the original formula $f(x)$.  Make a copy, for example $f(y)$, by rewriting $x$ as $y$.  Then we can subtract the second function from the first, eliminating the first coefficient.  We repeat additions and subtractions (possibly infinitely many times) until all coefficients except for the middle one have been eliminated. Example 2 : ""Division"" We multiply $f(x)$ by a function $g(y)$, where $g(y) = \frac{1}{1-x^{2n+1}}$, essentially making the series repeat forever.

What is desired / Motivations I'd simply like to have alternative formulations for the solution.  I'm using this for an algorithm, and I'd like to publish this with anyone who gives a formulation that provides a quick result.","Suppose that a rational generating function is given representing the function $f(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{2n}{c_i x^i}$ where $c_i \in \mathbb{N}$ The goal is to determine if the coefficient in the middle, $c_n$, is nonzero or not. For example, we could be given $f(x) = \frac{1 - 10x^9 + 9x^{10}}{(x - 1)^2}$, which represents $1 + 2x + 3x^2 + \cdots + 9x^8$.  We are interested, in this case, in the middle coefficient, which happens to be 5. Original Formulation The actual value can be determined by evaluating a contour integral.  This is accomplished by first multiplying $f(x)$ by $x^{-n}$.  Then, rewriting the variable $x$ as $x\cdot e^{i t}$ and finally evaluating the integral $\int_C{f(x)dt}$.  The result of all of this is the coefficient in question. The Goal I seek to find alternative formulations to this problem.  Let me give some examples. Example 1 : ""Tiling"" Start with the original formula $f(x)$.  Make a copy, for example $f(y)$, by rewriting $x$ as $y$.  Then we can subtract the second function from the first, eliminating the first coefficient.  We repeat additions and subtractions (possibly infinitely many times) until all coefficients except for the middle one have been eliminated. Example 2 : ""Division"" We multiply $f(x)$ by a function $g(y)$, where $g(y) = \frac{1}{1-x^{2n+1}}$, essentially making the series repeat forever.  We then divide this by $x^n\cdot g(y)$, and get the remainder.  This remainder is the first half of the original series, and $c_n$ can be easily obtained from this.

Define a function $\mu^*:\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R})\to[0,+\infty]$ by letting $\mu^*(A)$ be the infimum of the set of sums $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(F(b_n)-F(a_n))$ , where $\{(a_n,b_n]\}$ rangers over the set of sequences of half-open intervals that cover $A$ , in the sense that $A \subseteq \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}(a_n,b_n]$ .

If $\sum_n\mu^*(A_n)=+\infty$ , then $\mu^*(\bigcup_nA_n) \leq \sum_n\mu^*(a_n)$ certainly holds. So suppose that $\sum_n\mu^*(A_n)<+\infty$ , and let $\epsilon$ be an arbitrary positive number. For each $n$ choose a sequence $\{(a_{n,i},b_{n,i}]\}_{i=1}^{\infty}$ that covers $A_n$ and satisfies \begin{align*}     \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}(F(b_{n,i}) - F(a_{n,i})) < \mu^*(A_n) + \frac{\epsilon}{2^n}. \end{align*} If we combine these sequences into one sequence $\{(a_j,b_j]\}$ , then the combined sequence satisfies \begin{align*}     \bigcup_nA_n \subseteq \bigcup_j(a_j,b_j) \end{align*} and \begin{align*}     \sum_j(F(b_j) - F(a_j)) < \sum_n\left(\mu^*(A_n) + \frac{\epsilon}{2^n}\right) = \sum_n\mu^*(A_n) + \epsilon. \end{align*} These relations, together with the fact that $\epsilon$ is arbitrary, imply that $\mu^*(\bigcup_nA_n) \leq \sum_n\mu^*(A_n)$ .

However, I have difficulties construct a concrete sequence to show that this is indeed true. Here is some of my thought: Define a sequence $\{(c_{n,k},d_{n,k}]\}$ of half-open intervals such that $\bigcup_k(c_{n,k},d_{n,k}] = \bigcup_i(a_{n,i},b_{n,i}]\backslash A_n$ and that $d_{n,k} = c_{n,k}+p_{n,k}$ , where $\{p_{n,k}\}_{k=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence of positive number converging to $0$ such that for every $\epsilon>0$ we have $F(d_{n,k}) - F(c_{n,k}) = F(c_{n,k}+p_{n,k}) - F(c_{n,k}) < \frac{\epsilon}{2^k}\cdot\frac{1}{2^n}$ .

99,Very difficult recurrence relation for the coefficients of an ODE solution,Very difficult recurrence relation for the coefficients of an ODE solution,,"Context : I was working on answering this ODE question with a new method that I have never seen anyone use before (Frobenius method but with a twist) and I reduced the problem to a very difficult recurrence relation question; the terms in this case are the coefficients of a particular solution $y(x)$ with initial conditions $y(0)=0$ and $y'(0)=1.$ The recurrence relation is $c_{n\geq 3}=$ $$\frac1{n}\sum_{k=2}^{n-1}(n+1-k)c_{n+1-k}c_k-\frac{1}{n^2}$$ which I deduced is equivalent to $$\frac{n+1}n\sum_{k=2}^{\lceil (n-1)/2\rceil}c_{n+1-k}c_k\\+\left(n\bmod 2\right)\frac{n+1}{2n} c_{(n+1)/2}^2\\-\frac1{n^2}$$ where $c_0=0, c_1=1, c_2=\frac14.$ The first few terms are $$\left\{0,1,\frac14,-\frac5{72},-\frac{97}{1152},-\frac{10777}{172800},-\frac{243521}{6220800},-\frac{27545531}{1219276800},-\frac{1492739209}{78033715200},-\frac{212648420707}{21069103104000},-\frac{6885617878439}{1053455155200000},\cdots\right\}.$$ I was also able to deduce (though not rigorously so would be nice if someone could prove) that $\lim_{n\to\infty}c_n=0$ and $\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n=1$ (which means the terms eventually become positive again and most probably alternate between the $2$ signs while becoming absolutely small to converge to $0.$ ) I found (not rigorously) that for large $n\to\infty,$ the recurrence relation reduces to $$c_{2n+1}=\pm c_{n+1}$$ which might be hinting at when the sign change happens. I tried nonlinear substitutions like $c_n=e^n$ to extract the terms out of the sum, but I always get remaining terms in $n.$ I also tried $nc_n=d_n$ and then the same substitution $d_n=e^n$ but I get a constant equal to an $n$ -dependent harmonic number. Other things I tried are expressing the terms in terms of $c_1$ (where $c_2=\frac{c_1}{2(3c_1-1)}$ ) for example to find a polynomial solution. I tried the same stuff for the more general case of the ODE, where we have $c_0=y(0)≠0,$ but still couldn't solve it. This is generally a problem when solving these types of non-linear ODEs, as you can see via my other answers, so it would be very helpful to have a general approach so that we can tackle the case when $c_\infty=\infty$ for example (where accurate calculation is necesssary,) though I think this is too ambitious. I am not an expert in recurrence relations, so I would like the answers, if any, to be a bit comprehensive and beginner-friendly. Any somewhat accurate approximating simpler sequence, insight on the sequence's behaviour; when the terms are positive/negative, are they bounded, (dis)proofs of what I deduced on my own heuristically (which might be very wrong,) how we could have maybe readjusted the original (general) problem to make it easier on ourselves to add more conditions in our toolkit like for example expanding $y(u=\frac1x)$ instead of $y(x)$ for $x\in(-\infty,\infty)\setminus [-1,1]\implies u\in(-1,1),$ which makes it easier to make an approximating series as the later coefficients don't matter as much, would be very helpful.
