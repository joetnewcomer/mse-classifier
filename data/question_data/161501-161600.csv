We define the Lebesgue integral for $f$ as follow: $$ \int_X f(x) \ d\lambda(x) := sup \{ \ \int_X s(x) \ d\lambda(x) : s(x) \le f(x) \ \forall x \in X \ \} $$ where s(x) is a non-negative simple function. I cannot understand why do we require $f$ to be measurable . My thought is: we don't really need f to be measurable (I never mentioned it in the definition of the integral, I only said that $f(x)$ should be always not-smaller than any simple function $s(x)$ ). We never use it in the definition of the Lebesgue Integral . What we really need and indeed use is that the any simple function $s(x)$ be measurable (otherwise I cannot integrate it). Now, my guess is: do we require $f(x)$ to be measureable in order to be sure that all its approximation (i.e. the simple function ) are indeed measurable ?

Theorem 1.9 - Suppose that $(X,M,\mu)$ is a measure space. Let $\mathcal{N} = \{N\in M:\mu(N) = 0\}$ and $\overline{M} = \{E\cup F: E\in M, F\subset N, N\in\mathcal{N}\}$. Then $\overline{M}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra and there is a unique extension $\overline{\mu}$ of $\mu$ to a complete measure on $\overline{M}$. Claim 1 - $\overline{M}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra proof: i.) Since $M$ is a $\sigma$-algebra, $\emptyset\in M\subset \overline{M}$ so $\emptyset\in \overline{M}$. ii.) Suppose $B\in\overline{M}$ then there is an $E\in M$ such that $B = E\cup F$ where $F\subset N$ and $N\in\mathcal{N}$. Then  \begin{align*} X\setminus B &= X\cap B^c\\ &= X\cap (E\cup F)^c\\ &= X\cap ((E^c\cap N^c\cap F^c)\cup(F^c\setminus N^c))\\ &= X\cap ((E^c\cap N^c)\cup (F^c\cap N))\\ &= X\cap ((E\cup N)^c\cup (N\setminus F)) \end{align*} Since $(E\cup N)^c\in M$ and $(N\setminus F)\subset N\in M$ with $\mu(N) = 0$, then $B^c\in\overline{M}$. iii.) Let $\{B_j\}_{1}^{\infty}\in\overline{M}$ then for each $j$ there is an $E\in M$ such that $B_j = E_j\cup F_j$ where $F_j\subset N_j$ and $\mu(N_j) = 0$. So, $$\bigcup_{1}^{\infty}B_j = \bigcup_{1}^{\infty}(E_j\cup F_j) = \bigcup_{1}^{\infty}E_j \cup \bigcup_{1}^{\infty}F_j$$ Note that $\bigcup_{1}^{\infty}F_j\subset \bigcup_{1}^{\infty}N_j$ and $\mu\left(\bigcup_{1}^{\infty}N_j\right) = 0$. So we have $\bigcup_{1}^{\infty}B_j\in\overline{M}$. Therefore $\overline{M}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra. Claim 2 - There is a unique extention $\overline{\mu}$ of $\mu$ to a complete measure on $\overline{M}$ Proof: We first need to show that $\overline{\mu}$ is well-defined. Suppose $E\cup F\in\overline{M}$, set $\overline{\mu}(E\cup F) = \overline{\mu}(E)$. This is well-defined since if $E_1\cup F_1 = E_2\cup F_2$ where $F_j\subset N_j\in\mathcal{N}$. Then we know that $E_1\subset E_1\cup F_1 = E_2\cup F_2 = E_2\cup N_2$ then $E_1\subset E_2\cup N_2$ and so by monotonicity $\mu(E_1)\leq \mu(E_2) + \mu(N_2) = \mu(E_2)$. Also, since $E_2\subset E_2\cup F_2 = E_1\cup F_1 = E_1\cup N_1$ then again by monotonicity $\mu(E_2)\leq \mu(E_1)+\mu(N_1) = \mu(E_1)$. Thus $\overline{\mu}$ is well-defined. I now need to show that $\overline{\mu}$ is a complete measure on $\overline{M}$ and that $\overline{\mu}$ is the only measure on $\overline{M}$ that extends $\mu$. Step 1 - Show $\overline{\mu}$ is a measure. Proof: i.) $\overline{\mu}(\emptyset) = \overline{\mu}(\emptyset \cup F) = 0$ since $F\subset N$ with $\mu(N) = 0$. ii.) Let $\{A_n\}_{1}^{\infty}\in\overline{M}$, disjoint, then there is an $\{E_n\}_{1}^{\infty}\in M$ and a sequence $\{F_n\}_{1}^{\infty}\subset N\in\mathcal{N}$ such that $A_n = E_n\cup F_n$ for all $n$. Note from part (iii.) of claim 1, $\cup_{1}^{\infty}F_n\subset \cup_{1}^{\infty}N_n$. Thus,  \begin{align*} \overline{\mu}\left(\bigcup_{1}^{\infty}A_n\right) = \overline{\mu}\left(\bigcup_{1}^{\infty}E_n\cup F_n\right) &= \overline{\mu}\left(\bigcup_{1}^{\infty}E_n\cup \bigcup_{1}^{\infty}F_n\right)\\ &= \overline{\mu}\left(\bigcup_{1}^{\infty}E_n\right)\cup \overline{\mu}\left(\bigcup_{1}^{\infty}F_n\right)\\ &= \sum_{1}^{\infty}\overline{\mu}(E_n) + \sum_{1}^{\infty}\overline{\mu}(F_n)\\ &= \sum_{1}^{\infty}\overline{\mu}(A_n) \end{align*} Thus $\overline{\mu}$ is a measure. Step 2 - Show $\overline{\mu}$ is a complete measure. Proof: Let $A\subset X$ and suppose there is an $B\in\overline{M}$ such that $A\subset B$ and $\overline{\mu}(B) = 0$. Set $B = E\cup F$ where $E\in M$ and $F\subset N\in M$ with $\mu(N) = 0$.

Then we know that $E_1\subset E_1\cup F_1 = E_2\cup F_2 = E_2\cup N_2$ then $E_1\subset E_2\cup N_2$ and so by monotonicity $\mu(E_1)\leq \mu(E_2) + \mu(N_2) = \mu(E_2)$. Also, since $E_2\subset E_2\cup F_2 = E_1\cup F_1 = E_1\cup N_1$ then again by monotonicity $\mu(E_2)\leq \mu(E_1)+\mu(N_1) = \mu(E_1)$. Thus $\overline{\mu}$ is well-defined.

Note from part (iii.) of claim 1, $\cup_{1}^{\infty}F_n\subset \cup_{1}^{\infty}N_n$.

Show that for $\Omega:=\mathbb{R}$ it is not $\sigma$-finite but for $\Omega:=\mathbb{N}$. Hello and good afternoon! Here are my tries: (1) Consider $\Omega:=\mathbb{N}$. Define $A_n:=\left\{1,\ldots,n\right\}, n\geq 2$. Then $A_n\in\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N}), A_n\nearrow\mathbb{N}$ and $\zeta(A_n)=n<\infty$ for $n\geq 1$. So the measure $\zeta$ is $\sigma$-finite. (2) Now $\Omega:=\mathbb{R}$. First of all it is $\zeta(\mathbb{R})=\infty$ because the counting  measure of all sets that are not finite, is $\infty$.

Then for $A:=\bigcup_{i\geq 1}A_i$ it is because of the $\sigma$-additivity of $\zeta$ and the subtractivity $$ \zeta(A)=A_1\uplus\biguplus_{k\geq 2}(A_k\setminus A_{k-1})=\zeta(A_1)+\sum_{k\geq 2}\zeta(A_k\setminus A_{k-1})=\zeta(A_1)+\sum_{k\geq 2}\zeta(A_k)-\zeta(A_{k-1})=\zeta(A_{\infty})<\infty, $$ so because of the continuity of the measure it is  $$ \zeta(A_i)\nearrow\zeta(A)<\infty. $$ On the other hand it is $\zeta(A_i)\nearrow\zeta(\mathbb{R})=\infty$. So $\mathbb{R}\neq A$. Contradiction: It was assumed that $A_i\nearrow\mathbb{R}$, i.e. $A_i\nearrow A=\mathbb{R}$. So there do not exist $A_i\in\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}), i\geq 1$ with $A_i\nearrow\mathbb{R}$ and $\zeta(A_i)<\infty$, i.e. $\zeta$ is not $\sigma$-finite for $\Omega:=\mathbb{R}$.

Questions: $(1)$ What is a motivation of considering $a_N:=\inf_{k\geq N}\int f_k d\mu?$ $(2)$ Why does $\int f d\mu\leq a_N$ for each $N?$","The following question is taken from Royden Real Analysis $4$th edition, Chapter $4,$ question $20.$ Let $\{f_n\}$ be a sequence of nonnegative measurable functions that converges to $f$ pointwise on $E.$       Let $M\geq 0$ be such that $\int_E f_n\leq M$ for all $n.$       Show that $\int_E f\leq M.$       Verify that this property is equivalent to the statement of Fatou's Lemma. I have proven that $\int_E f\leq M.$ But I have no idea on how to tackle second part. After some googling, I found a solution in MSE , which goes as follows: Let $(f_n,n\in\Bbb N)$ be a sequence of measurable integrable functions and $a_N:=\inf_{k\geqslant N}\int f_kd\mu$. Working with the sequence $(f_n,n\geqslant N)$ (for which the sequence of integrals has the same $\liminf$ as those of the whole sequence), one can see that that $\int fd\mu\leqslant a_N$ for each $N$. Now take the limit $\lim_{N\to +\infty}$.

92,A countable set has outer measure zero. Explanation of Royden example.,A countable set has outer measure zero. Explanation of Royden example.,,"This is an example from Royden's Real Analysis 4th edition that I am having a lot of trouble understanding. A countable set has outer measure zero.  Let $C$ be a countable set enumerated as $C=\{c_k\}_{k=1}^{\infty}$.  Let $\epsilon > 0$.  For each natural number $k$, define $I_k=(c_k-\epsilon/2^{k+1}, c_k+\epsilon/2^{k+1})$.  The countable collection of open intervals $\{I_k\}_{\infty}^{k=1}$ covers $C$.  Therefore: $$ 0 \leq m^*(C)\leq \sum^{\infty}_{k=1} \ell(I_k)=\sum^{\infty}_{k=1}\epsilon/2^k = \epsilon$$ This inequality holds for each $\epsilon > 0$.  Hence $m^*(E) = 0$. What I understand along with questions: A countable set is a set like the natural numbers. $C=\{c_k\}_{k=1}^{\infty}$ is just a way to describe said countable set using indexing for all of the elements in the set. $I_k=(c_k-\epsilon/2^{k+1}, c_k+\epsilon/2^{k+1})$ I kind of understand.  This is defining an open cover over the countable set (I think). Why the $\epsilon/2^{k+1}$ instead of just $\epsilon$? It looks like the interval is continually shrinking as n goes to infinity. The equation in the middle is summing up all of the intervals.  The outer measure is simply the sum of all of the open intervals in the set C.  $m^*(C)$ is countably subadditive, hence the $\leq$ sign here:  $m^*(C)\leq \sum^{\infty}_{k=1} \ell(I_k)$ How is the last summation producing epsilon? How is this summing to zero? Thank you for your help. -Idle","This is an example from Royden's Real Analysis 4th edition that I am having a lot of trouble understanding.
