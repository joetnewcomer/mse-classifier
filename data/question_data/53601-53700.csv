4,Is there any possibility to do divergent summation with $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\exp(\sqrt k) $?,Is there any possibility to do divergent summation with ?,\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\exp(\sqrt k) ,"Self-studying some properties of the exponential-function I came to the question of ways to assign a value to the divergent sum $$s=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\exp(\sqrt k) $$ I have no idea how to attack this with standard methods (I do not know many). I tried a replacement using reversing order of summation when $s$ is expressed as double sum and introducing zeta at negative half-integer values. I wrote the double-sum as $$ \begin{array} {rr} s &=& \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} \frac{k^{j/2}}{j!}   &=& \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} k^{j/2}}{j!}     &=& \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} \frac{\zeta(-j/2)}{j!}  \end{array}$$ With this Pari/GP gives me about $ s=-0.753717005339 $ . Moreover I'm curious whether I have to extend the index to $-2$ to get formally $$s = -1 + 0 + \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{\zeta(-k/2)}{k!}$$ where I've set $\frac{\zeta(0.5)}{(-1)!} = 0 $ and $\frac{\zeta(1)}{(-2)!} =\frac{(-1)!}{(-2)!} =-1 $ to arrive at $ s_1=-1.753717005339 $ But this is just a shot in the dark. I've tried with another trick which works in some circumstances to sum the alternating series first, and then add an alternating partial series etc, like $$s=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{k-1} \exp(\sqrt k) + 2*\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{k-1} \exp(\sqrt{ 2 k}) + 4*... $$ but this doesn't help either since all sums are positive and I get another divergent and monotonuously increasing sequence of partial sums. One of the problems is, that regular summations cannot sum divergent series if all summands are positive and also increase, so my standard tools fail here. Q: how else could I sum that series? [edit]: Things begin to complicate... I tried another approach and got a result with a suspicious integer difference. I look at the formal powerseries  $$ g(x) = \exp(\sqrt{1+x}-1) = 1 + g_1 \frac{x}{1!}+ g_2 \frac{x^2}{2!}+ \ldots $$ and $$ \begin{array} {ll}  t&=&e*(g(0)+g(1)+g(2)+g(3)+...) \\\ &=& e*g(0) + e*(g(1)+g(2)+g(3)+\ldots) \\\ &=& e*g(0)+e*t_1 \end{array} $$ Then, by the same principle of reordering summation of the formal doubleseries we get another sum of zetas, but now at negative integer arguments  $$ \begin{array} {ll} t_1 &=& g(1)+g(2)+\ldots \\\ &=& 1*\zeta(0)+g_1*\frac{\zeta(-1)}{1!} +g_2*\frac{\zeta(-2)}{2!}+\ldots \end{array} $$ if that reordering makes sense. Interestingly the value which I get by this is $t=1.246282994682$ where much interestingly $s=t-2$ . This does not yet confirm one value over the other. But to have just a simple integer-difference seems to tell, that in principle these paths of computation are not completely meaningless (?) [Edit2]: using Ramanujan-summation as shown in the wikipedia-link I arrive at the same latter value of about $1.2462$ which is again $s+2$. What puzzles me is, that I'm used to negative values for divergent sums of increasing positiv terms. Did I miss something in the Ramanujan-formula? I used the formula $$C(a) = \int_0^a  f(t) dt - \frac12 f(0) - \ldots $$ where I insert my $g(x)$ above for $f(x)$ using $a=0$ (and thus the integral-term being zero). [Edit3]: It seems, that the method at [edit1] is just the Ramanujan-method where the Bernoulli-numbers are translated to the respective zeta-values [Edit4]: I had to correct the sum-formula; the factorials had to be removed Then the wikipedia-formula reads $$C(a) = \int_0^a  f(t) dt + \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \zeta(-k) \frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!} $$ Because we have a power series, the k'th derivative $f^{(k)}(0)=f_k*k! $ and we can replace this in the formula, cancelling the factorial. Furtherly I had used the function g(x), so  $$ t=e + e*\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \zeta(-k) g_k  $$   should equal $s$ . Unfortunately, this is also a divergent sum, but can be Euler-/Borel-summed. Interestingly, the integral-term $  \int_a^b  f(t) dt $ gives just the mysterious number 2 : $$ e*\int_{-1}^0  g(t) dt = \int_{0}^1  \exp(\sqrt{t}) dt = 2 $$ according to wolfram-alpha . With this it seems I can use the much better summable (if not convergent) series $$ s=\sum_{j=0}^{\infty} \frac{\zeta(-j/2)}{j!} $$ and determine that Ramanujan-summ  $$ t = \int_{0}^1  \exp(\sqrt{t}) dt + s $$ [Edit5] It seems, that the possibility for computations is coherent for other exponents in the basic series. If I generalize  $$ \begin{array} {rr} S_q &=& \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \exp(k^q) \\       g_q(x)  &=& \exp((1+x)^q-1) &=& \exp((1+x)^q)/e \\      Ca_q &=& \int_0^1 \exp(x^q)   \end{array} $$ and $t_q$ and $s_q$ accordingly, then for some positive fractional q I get the following results. $$ \small{ \begin{array} {rrrr}  q&   t_q &                      Ca_q           & &  s_q           &  C_q(0) \\  1.00000000000 & 1.13630512159 & 1.71828182846 &(= 1e - 1) & -0.581976706869 & 1.13630512286 \\  0.500000000000 & 1.24628299466 & 2.00000000000  &(=- 0e + 2)& -0.753717005339 & 1.24628299491 \\  0.333333333333 & 1.28422772983 & 2.15484548538  &(= 3e - 6)& -0.870617755549 & 1.28422772997 \\  0.250000000000 & 1.30316006154 & 2.25374537233  &(=-8e + 4!) & -0.950585310784 & 1.30316006162 \\  0.200000000000 & 1.31447347236 & 2.32268228066 &(=45e - 5!)& -1.00820880830 & 1.31447347240 \\  0.166666666667 & 1.32198952281 & 2.37359728681 &(=-264e + 6!)& -1.05160776400 & 1.32198952284 \\  0.142857142857 & 1.32734318867 & 2.41279179153&(=1855e - 7!) & -1.08544860285 & 1.32734318869 \\  0.125000000000 & 1.33134949700 & 2.44392029544 &(=-14832e + 8!)& -1.11257079844 & 1.33134949702 \\  0.111111111111 & 1.33445988876 & 2.46925379716 &(=1334978e - 9!)& -1.13479390840 & 1.33445988878 \\  0.100000000000 & 1.33694450266 & 2.49028031297 &(=-A240(10)e + 10!)& -1.15333581032 & 1.33694450267 \\  0.0909090909091 & 1.33897484256 & 2.50801667035  &(=A240(11)e - 11!)& -1.16904182779 & 1.33897484257 \\  0.0833333333333 & 1.34066501173 & 2.52318189730 &(=-A240(12)e + 12!)& -1.18251688557 & 1.34066501173  \end{array}  } $$ where $t_q$ in the second column is the assumed sum computed by the method $ t_q = Ca_q + s_q $ .

But I don't really know how to prove this, Can anyone give me an idea or prove this wrong? Addition Information If we consider a more complex situation, given two nonnegative integers X and Y, make the following sequence: \begin{align*} x_{n+1} = \frac{y_n}{x_n^2+y_n^2}+X&, \quad y_{n+1}=\frac{x_n}{x_n^2+y_n^2}+Y, \\ \end{align*} with $x_1=0, y_1=1$ , The corresponding recursive expression of the complex sequence is \begin{align*} a_{n+1}=X+Y\mathrm{i}+\frac{\mathrm{i}}{a_n} \end{align*} For ease of description, we denote $p_k$ as the number of terms in $x_n, y_n$ where the $k^{th}$ simplest denominator is different. For instance, for the initial case of $X=0, Y=1$ , we have $p_1=6, p_2=12, \cdots$ . We also denote $\Delta_{p_n} = p_{n+1} - p_n$ . In the initial case, our conjecture is to prove that $p_n$ forms an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of $6$ , or $\Delta{p_n}=6$ . To explore the general case, a natural idea is that $p_n$ could potentially be a combination of terms from multiple arithmetic sequences, for example, $p_{2k+1}=4k+3, p_{2k}=2k+2$ .

Prove or disprove the comapctness of the closure of the unit ball of $C^1[0, 1]$ in $C[0, 1]$. What have I tried? I think it's pretty clear that the unit ball in $C^1[0,1]$ is $B= \{f \in C^{1}[0,1]: \lVert f \rVert \leq 1\}$. Let us denote $K= \operatorname{cl}_{C[0,1]}(B)$, the closure of $B$ in $C[0,1]$. I really didn't have much clue how to start working on this problem but finally thought about using the sequential approach. If $a$ and $b$ are two points such that $0<a<b<1$ then I think there can be functions $f_a$ and $f_b$ having the property that $\lVert f_a-f_b \rVert = 1$ which are sufficiently smooth to be in $C^1$.  Now as it is quite tedious to construct these functions explicitly, I scanned a hand-drawn picture of what I think they might look like. Here $f_a$ and $f_b$ take zero values in almost all of the interval $[0,1]$ and jumps up at $a$ and $b$ respectively. Also, as is clear from the figure, they don't assume non-zero values simultaneously.

And thanks a zillion for any help that you can offer.","[I really want to apologize if this problem looks a little too long.] The problem : This is taken from here [Question. 3.7 (c)] and it says... Prove or disprove the comapctness of the closure of the unit ball of $C^1[0, 1]$ in $C[0, 1]$. What have I tried? I think it's pretty clear that the unit ball in $C^1[0,1]$ is $B= \{f \in C^{1}[0,1]: \lVert f \rVert \leq 1\}$. Let us denote $K= \operatorname{cl}_{C[0,1]}(B)$, the closure of $B$ in $C[0,1]$. I really didn't have much clue how to start working on this problem but finally thought about using the sequential approach. If $a$ and $b$ are two points such that $0<a<b<1$ then I think there can be functions $f_a$ and $f_b$ having the property that $\lVert f_a-f_b \rVert = 1$ which are sufficiently smooth to be in $C^1$.  Now as it is quite tedious to construct these functions explicitly, I scanned a hand-drawn picture of what I think they might look like. Here $f_a$ and $f_b$ take zero values in almost all of the interval $[0,1]$ and jumps up at $a$ and $b$ respectively. Also, as is clear from the figure, they don't assume non-zero values simultaneously. Now, my argument is clear: however close the two points $a$ and $b$ come to each other (remaining distinct) there will always be functions like $f_a$ and $f_b$. They may get steeper and steeper but will never lose their $C^1$-ness.

When can we say that $T$ is a dual, or adjoint, of an operator on $c_0$?  In other words, under what conditions can we find a continuous linear $S:c_0\to c_0$ such that $T=S^*$? Recall that $c_0$ is a subspace of $\ell_\infty=\ell_1^*$, and so we can talk about the restriction $T^*|_{c_0}$ of $T^*:\ell_\infty\to\ell_\infty$ to $c_0$. Observation. If $T^*c_0\subseteq c_0$ then $T=S^*$ for some continuous linear $S:c_0\to c_0$. Proof. Notice that $(T^*|_{c_0})^*$ is a continuous linear operator acting on $\ell_1$.  We claim $T=(T^*|_{c_0})^*$.  If not, then there is $z^*\in\ell_1$ so that $Tz^*\neq(T^*|_{c_0})^*z^*$.  Hence, there is $y^{**}\in c_0\subset\ell_\infty$ such that $(Tz^*)(y^{**})\neq((T^*|_{c_0})^*z^*)(y^{**})$.

Proof. The proof relies on complex analysis.  Let us directly consider the function $$ f(z)=\frac{\operatorname{cs}\left(z,\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)}{\cosh(\frac{\pi z}{2K})^3\sinh(\frac{\pi z}{2K})^2}. $$ Where $\operatorname{cs}(z,k)$ denotes one of Jacobi's elliptic functions.

Since $\operatorname{cs}$ has double periodicity and poles at $z=\{ (2m+2ni)K\mid (m,n)\in\mathbb{Z}^2\} $ , we have $$ \mathcal{P.V.}\int_{-L}^{L}[f(z)-f(z+2Ki)]\text{d}z+ \sum_{L_n\in\text{semicircles}}\int_{L_n}f(z)\text{d}z +\int_{L}^{L+2Ki}f(z)\text{d}z+\int_{-L+2Ki}^{-L}f(z)\text{d}z =2\pi i\sum_{z_k\in\text{poles inside the contour}}\operatorname{Res}(f(z),z_k). $$ As $L\rightarrow+\infty$ , the first, third and fourth integrals obviously vanish because $f(z)$ is odd. So we have $$ \sum_{L_n\in\text{semicircles}}\int_{L_n}f(z)\text{d}z=2\pi i\sum_{z_k\in\text{poles inside the contour}}\operatorname{Res}(f(z),z_k). $$ The rest is easy.

We can't even use this to find something new about it: $$p(x)=\prod_{k=0}^{\infty} \left( 1-x^{2^k} \right)=\frac{\prod_{k=0}^{\infty}  \left( 1-x^{2^{k+1}} \right)}{\prod_{k=0}^{\infty}  \left( 1+x^{2^k} \right)}$$ We only get the obvious recurrence relation: $$p(x)=(1-x)~p(x^2)$$ Mathematica gives this plot (for 25 terms).

This has its own Leibnitz-like series $$\dfrac{\pi}{2\sqrt2}=\dfrac{1}{1}+\dfrac{1}{3}-\dfrac{1}{5}-\dfrac{1}{7}+\cdots\tag2$$ where the sign reverses when the denominator crosses a multiple of $4$ . This latter series is provable in many ways, for instance with a Fourier series . Since the left side of Eq. 1 is the square of the left side of Eq. 2, it is tempting to suppose that somehow Eq. 1 could be derived by squaring Eq. 2. A brute force approach generates the right squared terms, but how do the cross-product terms cancel out to get the correct form for Eq. 1? I have done some work on the problem, identifying a method that appears to derive Eq. (2) from Eq. (1). The method is based on the ""long division"" method of square root extraction. Assume that the square root of $$\frac{1}{1^2}+\frac{1}{3^2}+\frac{1}{5^2}+\cdots$$ is to be rendered in the form $$s_0\dfrac{1}{1}+s_1\dfrac{1}{3}+s_2\dfrac{1}{5}+s_3\dfrac{1}{7}+\cdots$$ where each $s_k$ term is $\pm1$ and the signs are chosen to give back the original sum of squares with no cross-product terms. As with the usual version of the square root extraction algorithm, we begin with the square root of the first term of the series, thus $+1$ making the $s_0$ sign positive. We multiply this by $2$ to get $2$ , which we use later. Now compare the next term in the radicand, $+1/9$ , with $-1/2$ times the next term whose sign is to be determined, $1/3$ . The comparison figure is meant to compensate approximately for the rest of the infinite series in the radicand; that is for each odd $n$ the sum of terms following $1/n^2$ is approximated as $1/(2n)$ and our comparison figure of $-1/(2n)$ will compensate for that. Clearly $+1/9$ is greater, indicating that the exact square root will be greater than our current partial sum ( $1$ ). Like a one-dimensional game of ""hot and cold"", we therefore select $s_1=+1$ , making our second partial sum $1+(1/3)$ and its doubled value, $2+(2/3)=8/3$ , to be used in the next round. Now add the $+1/3$ term we just rendered to the doubled value of the pervious sum, giving $2+(1/3)=7/3$ , then multiply by $+1/3$ to get $7/9$ .  Subtract this from $+1/9$ , which was our previous leading term, and combine with the next term $1/25$ from the radicand to get $-49/75$ as our next leading term. This is now less than $-1/2$ times the $1/5$ term we are signing next, so we assume our square root must be less than $1+(1/3)$ and thus render $s_2=-1$ , giving $1+(1/3)-(1/5)$ as our third partial sum and twice that equaling $(8/3)-(2/5)=34/15$ . Adding $-1/5$ to $34/15$ gives $31/15$ and multiplying the latter by the $-1/5$ term we introduced gives $-31/75$ , which when subtracted from $-49/75$ yields $-6/25$ . Combining this with $1/49$ gives $-269/1225$ as our next leading term. This is still less than $(-1/2)×(1/7)=-1/14$ , so we will assign $s_3=-1$ for the $1/7$ term in our square root. The sign pattern thus far ( $+(1/1)+(1/3)-(1/5)-(1/7)$ ) matches that for the series in Eq. (2), and when I set up the procedure on a MS Excel spreadsheet the correct sign pattern is found to hold for at least 101 terms. This approach can be converted to a proof of the claim if we can prove that: The algorithm described above will continue to give the sign cycle $++--$ .

41,Determining finitude or infinitude from a simple geometric construction,Determining finitude or infinitude from a simple geometric construction,,"Playing with a pencil on a checkered sheet I encountered this construction: 1) take a point $A$ on the grid and a point $B$ that is distant from $A$ $n=2,3,4...$ horizontal steps and $1$ vertical step, so that $\overline{AB}=\sqrt{n^2+1}$ . 2) complete a square $ABCD$ on the grid starting from the segment $AB$ . This is the square $Q_0$ . 3) Starting from $A$ take a point $A_1$ at the first intersection of $AB$ with a line of the grid. And do the same starting from  the other points $B,C,D$ finding the points $B_1,C_1,D_1$ . 4) connect the points $A_1, B_1,C_1,D_1$ , so that we have a new square $Q_1$ . 5) redo the same points $3$ and $4$ and find the square $Q_2$ and so  again... The result is a sequence $S_n$ of squares whose sides, orientation, and number of different elements depend from $n$ . The figures show the construction for $n=2$ , and for $n=3$ .

So he gave me a call and asked to calculate which heating element to buy (more precisely, he asked what electric power does the heating element need to make the descending water hot in 10 minutes; hot was defined as 40 Celsius). The water tank is huge and the heater is placed at one of its dead ends; it wouldn't be correct to say the temperature is uniform and does not vary from one point to another. The only person for whom I can abandon my work is my father, so I took a standard heat equation : $$\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = a^2 \left( \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial z^2} \right) + f (x,y,z,t)$$ with initial and boundary conditions $$T(x,y,z,0) = T_0, \hskip 20 pt T(x,y,z,t)\Big|_{\text{boundary}} = T_0$$ and with $$f(x,y,z,t) = \frac{P}{c\rho} \delta(x - x_0) \delta (y - y_0) \delta (z - z_0)$$ for this case (point-like heater located at $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ , $P$ is heater electric power, $c$ is water specific heat capacity, $\rho$ is water density), $a = \sqrt{\kappa/c\rho}$ is water thermal diffusivity, $\kappa$ is water thermal conductivity. After a tough computation I got the solution: $$T (x,y,z,t) = T_0 +  \frac{P}{lwh \kappa} \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \sum\limits_{u=1}^{\infty} \sum\limits_{v=1}^{\infty}  \frac{\sin \left(\frac{\pi n x}{l} \right) \sin \left(\frac{\pi u y}{w} \right) \sin \left(\frac{\pi v z}{h} \right) \sin \left(\frac{\pi n x_0}{l} \right) \sin \left(\frac{\pi u y_0}{w} \right) \sin \left(\frac{\pi v z_0}{h} \right)}{\left( \frac{\pi n}{l} \right)^2  + \left( \frac{\pi u}{w} \right)^2  + \left( \frac{\pi v}{h} \right)^2  } \cdot $$ $$\cdot \left(1 - \exp\left( - \left( \frac{\pi n a}{l} \right)^2 t - \left( \frac{\pi u a}{w} \right)^2 t - \left( \frac{\pi v a}{h} \right)^2 t \right) \right)$$ So guys, if you will ever install a water tank in your attic, you know where to look. Here $l$ , $w$ , $h$ are length, width and height of the tank.

To resolve it, to find the $P$ , I need to numerically compute this triple sum somehow. Here go my thoughts on the subject: the triple sum $\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \sum\limits_{u=1}^{\infty} \sum\limits_{v=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2 + u^2 + v^2}$ does not converge; you need to have a power of at least $(3+\varepsilon)$ in denominator trigonometric functions in the numerator really matter: $\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n}$ does not converge but $\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\cos n}{n}$ does one can utilise the formula for sine product ( $\sin \left(\frac{\pi n x_1}{l}\right) \sin \left(\frac{\pi n x_0}{l}\right) = \dots$ ) and rewrite the numerator into 8 terms of three cosines thus, what I'm interested in is the sum $\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \sum\limits_{u=1}^{\infty} \sum\limits_{v=1}^{\infty} \frac{\cos n \cos u \cos v}{n^2 + u^2 + v^2}$ clearly, for numeric computation (e.g. in Mathematica) it would be wonderful to find the precise $N$ , $U$ , $V$ such that $\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \sum\limits_{u=1}^{\infty} \sum\limits_{v=1}^{\infty} (\dots) \approx \sum\limits_{n=1}^{N} \sum\limits_{u=1}^{U} \sum\limits_{v=1}^{V} (\dots)$ There's a decent identity $\int\limits_0^{\infty} \frac{sin at}{a} e^{-bt} dt = \frac{1}{a^2 + b^2}$ , which is proved by integration by parts twice. It allows you to split $\frac{1}{a^2 + b^2}$ into factors, into multipliers. Given this split, computing $\sum\limits_{a=1}^{\infty} \sum\limits_{b=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{a^2 + b^2}$ is relatively easy (well, one can calculate both sums and then prove the resulting integral does not converge). However, I failed to split $\frac{1}{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}$ in this manner. With Fourier transform (see wiki , end of the page, row 502) $$\frac{1}{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} = \iiint\limits_{\mathbb{R}^3} \frac{e^{-2\pi i (a \xi_a + b\xi_a + c\xi_c)}}{\xi_a^2 + \xi_b^2 + \xi_c^2} d\xi_a d\xi_b d\xi_c $$ the triple sum $\sum\limits_{a=1}^{\infty} \sum\limits_{b=1}^{\infty} \sum\limits_{c=1}^{\infty} \frac{\cos a \cos b \cos c}{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}$ could be reduced to ordinary sums such as $\sum\limits_{a=1}^{\infty} \cos a \cdot e^{-2\pi i a \xi_a}$ .

Solution for $n=2$ $a_0=1$ $$2a_1=a_{1}+a_{2}$$ $$a^2_2=a_{1}a_{2}$$ $$a_2=a_{1}$$ Solution for $n=3$ $a_0=1$ $$3a_1=a_1+a_2+a_3$$ $$3a^2_2=a_1a_2+a_1a_3+a_2a_3$$ $$a^3_3=a_1a_2a_3$$ . . $$2a_1=a_2+a_3 \tag1$$ $$3a^2_2=a_1a_2+a_1a_3+a_2a_3 \tag2$$ $$a^2_3=a_1a_2 \tag3$$ . $$3a^2_2=a_1(a_2+a_3)+a_2a_3=2a^2_1+a_2a_3$$ $$6a^2_2=4a^2_1+2a_2a_3=(a_2+a_3)^2+2a_2a_3$$ $$5a^2_2-4a_2a_3-a^2_3=0$$ $$(5a_2+a_3)(a_2-a_3)=0$$ If we select $a_3=-5a_2$ then $25a_2=a_1$ To check Equation 1 $$2a_1=a_2+a_3$$ $$50a_2 \neq a_2-5a_2$$ Thus $$(5a_2+a_3)(a_2-a_3)=0$$ We must use  $a_2-a_3=0$ $a_2=a_3$ To check Equation 1,3 Equation 1: $$2a_1=a_2+a_3$$ $$a_1=a_3$$ Equation 3: $a^2_3=a_1a_2 $ $$a_1=a_3$$ Thus $$a_1=a_2=a_3$$",,"['sequences-and-series', 'binomial-coefficients']"
95,infinite series involving harmonic numbers and zeta,infinite series involving harmonic numbers and zeta,,"I ran across a fun looking series and am wondering how to tackle it. $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{H_{n}}{n^{3}}=\frac{{\pi}^{4}}{72}.$$ One idea I had was to use the digamma and the fact that $$\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{1}{k}=\int_{0}^{1}\frac{1-t^{n}}{1-t}dt=\psi(n+1)+\gamma.$$ Along with the identity $\psi(n+1)=\psi(n)+\frac{1}{n}$,  I managed to get it into the form $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{H_{n}}{n^{3}}=\gamma\zeta(3)+\zeta(4)+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\psi(n)}{n^{3}}.$$ This would mean that $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\psi(n)}{n^{3}}=\frac{{\pi}^{4}}{360}-\gamma\zeta(3).$$  Which, according to Maple, it does.  But, how to show it?.  If possible. I also started with $\frac{-\ln(1-x)}{x(1-x)}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}H_{n}x^{n-1}$. Then divided by x and differentiated several times.  This lead to some interesting, but albeit, tough integrals involving the dilog: $$-\int\frac{\ln(1-x)}{x(1-x)}dx=Li_{2}(x)+\frac{\ln^{2}(1-x)}{2}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{H_{n}x^{n}}{n}.$$ Doing this again and again lead to some integrals that appeared to be going in the right direction. $$\int_{0}^{1}\frac{Li_{3}(x)}{x}dx=\frac{{\pi}^{4}}{90}$$ $$-\int_{0}^{1}\frac{\ln^{2}(1-x)\ln(x)}{2x}dx=\frac{{\pi}^{4}}{360}$$ $$-\int_{0}^{1}\frac{\ln(1-x)Li_{2}(1-x)}{x}dx=\frac{{\pi}^{4}}{72}$$ But, what would be a good approach for this one?
