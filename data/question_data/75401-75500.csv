14,Is my own proof of the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem correct?,Is my own proof of the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem correct?,,"I wonder my own proof of the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem is correct or rigorous enough, and I also find a proof of the relevant theorem in Tao's Analysis weird. Here is my proof of the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem. Let $\{a_n\}$ be a bounded sequence which is bounded in $[a,b]$. Let $D=\big\{x\in[a,b]~|~[a,x]$ contains infintely many terms of $\{a_n\}\big\}$, in which the predicate ""$[a,x]$ contains infintely many terms of $\{a_n\}$"" can be transfered into a more rigorous manner, ""$\big\{n|a_n\in [a,x]\big\}$ is infinite."" Hence $D=\Big\{x\in[a,b]\Big|\big\{n|a_n\in [a,x]\big\}\text{ is infinite}\Big\}$. Here we first clarify some important observation of $D$. First, is $D$ non-empty? Yes, because $b$ must in $D$. Second, does $D$ have the supremum and infimum? Yes, since $b\in D$ and $a$ is definitely a lower bound of $D$(but not neccessarily in $D$), by the Least Upper Bound property, $D$ has the supremum and infimum. Last, must $D$ have the least element in it? No, for example, if $\{a_n\}$ is defined strictly decreasing and converges to some point $x\in [a,b)$, then $D$ has no least element. Now we start the proof. Let $x=\inf D$. If $x=a$, the proof is trivial(the subsequence is $a,a,a,a,a,\dotsc$). If $x=b$, the proof is similar to the case $x\in(a,b)$, so I just prove the case $x\in(a,b)$. Because $x$ might not in $D$, so we can't directly conclude that $[a,x]$ contains infinitely many points of $\{a_n\}$. But let $\varepsilon >0$, then $[a,x-\varepsilon]$ must contains finite points of $\{a_n\}$, that is, $\big\{n|a_n\in [a,x-\varepsilon]\big\}$ is finite. By the Approximation Property for Infimum, there also exists a point $y\in D$ such that $x\leq y<x+\varepsilon$, hence $[a,y]$ has infinitely many points of $\{a_n\}$, that is, $\big\{n|a_n\in [a,y]\big\}$ is infinite. Now we claim that $[a,y]\setminus[a,x-\varepsilon]=(x-\varepsilon,y]$ has infinitely many points of $\{a_n\}$ in a rigorous manner, rather than an intuitive argument. Since $a_n\in [a,x-\varepsilon]\Rightarrow a_n\in [a,y]$, so $\big\{n|a_n\in [a,x-\varepsilon]\big\}\subseteq\big\{n|a_n\in [a,y]\big\}$. So for any $\varepsilon>0$, the difference of an infinite set and finite set, $\big\{a_n|a_n\in(x-\varepsilon,y]\big\}$, is infinite. We're now going to construct our subsequence. Let $\varepsilon>0$, we can pick an $a_N\in(x-\varepsilon,y]\subsetneq(x-\varepsilon,x+\varepsilon)$.

Continuing on this way, we can construct a subsequence, and it is easy to check  that this subsequence converges to $x$, and we omit the detail. $\blacksquare$ Here are my questions. Is my proof correct? Is any part of this proof redundant? Can any part of this proof be simplified? In Terence Tao's Analysis 1, he stated a theorem(Prop. 6.6.6) that any sequence has a subsequence converges to its limit point. He then gave the hint of the proof in the Exercis 6.6.5. He defined a sequence $n_j=\min\{n|a_n\in[L-\frac{1}{j},L+\frac{1}{j}]\}$. Of course, by the Well-Ordering Principle of natural numbers, we know the $\{n_j\}$ is well-defined. However, I think $\{n_j\}$ is not guaranteed to be strictly increasing simply by letting the value of $n_j$ to be the minimum index of $\{a_n\}$ that falled in the interval. (Because, for example, when $j=10$, $a_{100}$ is the mininum-index term in $[L-\frac{1}{10},L+\frac{1}{10}]$, however, when $j=11$, $a_{100}$ is still in $[L-\frac{1}{11},L+\frac{1}{11}]$, so it will be chosen duplicately again.) And we know that in order to make $\{a_{n_j}\}$ to be a so-called ""subsequence"", $\{n_j\}$ must be strictly increasing. So we can't pick a subsequence like this. Am I correct? -------------UPDATED--------------- I made mistakes on discussing the endpoints. Edited like this: if $\inf D=b$, since $b\in D$, then $\inf D\in D$. For any $\varepsilon>0$, $[a,b-\varepsilon]$ has finite points of $\{a_n\}$, hence $[a,b]\setminus[a,b-\varepsilon]=(b-\varepsilon,b]$ has infinitely many point of $\{a_n\}$. So it's easy to construct a subsequence. If $\inf D=a$, and if $\inf D=a\in D$, then $[a,a]$ has infinitely many points of $\{a_n\}$, so the subsequence is trivially $a,a,a,a,a,\dotsc$. Otherwise if $\inf D=a\not\in D$, then $[a,a]$ has only finite points of $\{a_n\}$. For any $\varepsilon>0$, by the Approximation Property for Infimum, there exists $y\in D$ such that $a\leq y<a+\varepsilon$. So $[a,y]$ has infinitely many point of $\{a_n\}$. Therefore, $[a,y)\setminus[a,a]=(a,y]\subsetneq(a,a+\varepsilon)$ has infinitely many point of $\{a_n\}$, then we can construct the subsequence. The proof became a bit lengthy. However, I just now came up with a brilliant idea! As my proof stated in the beginning, I suppose the sequence to be in $[a,b]$. Now, we redefine $D$ to be $\mathfrak{D}=\big\{x\in[a-1000,b+1000]~|~[a-1000,x]$ contains infintely many terms of $\{a_n\}\big\}$. Then $\inf\mathfrak{D}$ must not be the endpoint of this new and bigger interval, so we need not to discuss the case when $\inf\mathfrak{D}=a-1000$ or $\inf\mathfrak{D}=b+1000$ anymore!","I wonder my own proof of the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem is correct or rigorous enough, and I also find a proof of the relevant theorem in Tao's Analysis weird. Here is my proof of the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem. Let $\{a_n\}$ be a bounded sequence which is bounded in $[a,b]$. Let $D=\big\{x\in[a,b]~|~[a,x]$ contains infintely many terms of $\{a_n\}\big\}$, in which the predicate ""$[a,x]$ contains infintely many terms of $\{a_n\}$"" can be transfered into a more rigorous manner, ""$\big\{n|a_n\in [a,x]\big\}$ is infinite."" Hence $D=\Big\{x\in[a,b]\Big|\big\{n|a_n\in [a,x]\big\}\text{ is infinite}\Big\}$. Here we first clarify some important observation of $D$. First, is $D$ non-empty? Yes, because $b$ must in $D$. Second, does $D$ have the supremum and infimum? Yes, since $b\in D$ and $a$ is definitely a lower bound of $D$(but not neccessarily in $D$), by the Least Upper Bound property, $D$ has the supremum and infimum. Last, must $D$ have the least element in it? No, for example, if $\{a_n\}$ is defined strictly decreasing and converges to some point $x\in [a,b)$, then $D$ has no least element. Now we start the proof. Let $x=\inf D$. If $x=a$, the proof is trivial(the subsequence is $a,a,a,a,a,\dotsc$). If $x=b$, the proof is similar to the case $x\in(a,b)$, so I just prove the case $x\in(a,b)$. Because $x$ might not in $D$, so we can't directly conclude that $[a,x]$ contains infinitely many points of $\{a_n\}$. But let $\varepsilon >0$, then $[a,x-\varepsilon]$ must contains finite points of $\{a_n\}$, that is, $\big\{n|a_n\in [a,x-\varepsilon]\big\}$ is finite. By the Approximation Property for Infimum, there also exists a point $y\in D$ such that $x\leq y<x+\varepsilon$, hence $[a,y]$ has infinitely many points of $\{a_n\}$, that is, $\big\{n|a_n\in [a,y]\big\}$ is infinite. Now we claim that $[a,y]\setminus[a,x-\varepsilon]=(x-\varepsilon,y]$ has infinitely many points of $\{a_n\}$ in a rigorous manner, rather than an intuitive argument. Since $a_n\in [a,x-\varepsilon]\Rightarrow a_n\in [a,y]$, so $\big\{n|a_n\in [a,x-\varepsilon]\big\}\subseteq\big\{n|a_n\in [a,y]\big\}$. So for any $\varepsilon>0$, the difference of an infinite set and finite set, $\big\{a_n|a_n\in(x-\varepsilon,y]\big\}$, is infinite. We're now going to construct our subsequence.

But, the contradiction of the theorem itself is that : If $f$ is the identity function, i.e. if $f (\theta) = \theta$ (degree $1$), it still is extendable on the Disk and a straight-line homotopy $F(\theta, t) = (1-t) f (\theta)$ deforms $f (\theta)$ to a constant map which has degree $0$. Contradiction? PS - Please let me know to add the proof below if it's necessary but I think the proof is irrelevant. Proof. Throughout the proof, we represent the points in the disk with polar coordinates $(r,\theta)$. $\quad$ First, assume that $f$ extends to a continuous function $F:D\to S^1$. Define a function $G:S^1\times I\to S^1$ by $G(\theta,t)=F(t,\theta)$. Since $F$ is continuous, so is $G$. Therefore $G$ is homotopy between the circle functions $G|_{S^1\times\{0\}}$ and $G|_{S^1\times\{1\}}$, implying that these functions have the same degree. The function $G|_{S^1\times\{0\}}$ is given by $$G|_{S^1\times\{0\}}(\theta)=G(\theta,0)=F(0,\theta)=F(0,0).$$ It follows that $G|_{S^1\times\{0\}}$ is a constant function and therefore has degree $0$. Thus, $G|_{S^1\times\{1\}}$ also has degree $0$. It is straightforward to see that $G|_{S^1\times\{1\}}$ is equal to $f$, implying that $f$ has degree $0$, as desired. $\quad$ Now assume that $f$ has degree $0$. Therefore there exists a homotopy $G:S^1\times I\to S^1$ such that $G(\theta,0)=c_0(\theta)$ and $G(\theta,1)=f(\theta)$, where $c_0:S^1\to S^1$ is the constant function sending each point $\theta\in S^1$ to the point $0\in S^1$. Define $F:D\to S^1$ by $F(r,\theta)=G(\theta,r)$. Since $G(\theta,r)$ is constant in $\theta$ when $r=0$, it follows that $F$ is well defined at $r=0$ and therefore is defined as a function on $D$. Furthermore, $G$ being continuous implies that $F$ is  as well. Finally, $F(1,\theta)=G(\theta,1)=f(\theta)$, implying that $F$ is an extension of $f$. $\tag*{${\blacksquare}{}$}$","According to the book 'Introduction to Topology.

If isn't of the form then all with an integer will be dense on the points of the circle of radius 1 and we will find the eigenvalues of near wich will contracdict the first inegality. How can I continue ?

98,Closed and Connected Subset of a Metric Space,Closed and Connected Subset of a Metric Space,,"My English may not be perfect since I'm not a native speaker, so please do point out the grammar mistakes if there are any. I've been reading Conway's ""Functions of One Complex Variable"", and encountered following exercise in the book (p. 17). $X$ here is a metric space and $d$ is the metric of it. Show that if $F\subset X$ is closed and connected then for every pair of points $a,b$ in $F$ and each $\epsilon>0$ there are points $z_{0},z_{1},\dots,z_{n}$ in $F$ with $z_{0}=a, z_{n}=b$ and $d(z_{k-1},z_{k})<\epsilon$ for $1\leq k\leq n$. Is the hypothesis that $F$ be closed needed? If $F$ is a set which satisfies this property then $F$ is not necessarily connected, even if $F$ is closed. Give an example to illustrate this. Now, I guess the right way to solve this problem is to first fix a point $a$ and consider  the subset $S$ of $F$ definded by $$S=\{b\in X;\ for\ all\ \epsilon>0,\  there\ are\  points \ z_{0},z_{1},\dots,z_{n}\  in \ F\  with\ z_{0}=a, z_{n}=b\ and \ d(z_{k-1},z_{k})<\epsilon\  for \ 1\leq k\leq n\}$$and show that this set is nonempty, open and closed, but I'm currently stuck. I'm not sure where I should use the condition that $F$ is closed. Moreover, the rest of the problem is also challenging, and I can't think of any possible way to get started. Am I going in the right direction? Please give me a clear motivation on this problem and possibly the solution!! :D","My English may not be perfect since I'm not a native speaker, so please do point out the grammar mistakes if there are any.
