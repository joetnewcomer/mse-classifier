How many 4-letter strings are there that do not have “aa” in the middle? I so far answered: We assume that a word could have multiple same letters. Since the word is only four letters, a can not be in the second and third position. We look at this as a can be in either the second or third position. Accoringly: (all combos with no a in second or third position) + all combos with a in second but not third + a in third but not second.

I'm working on the following problem, and have found a solution for each, but I'd like to verify my understanding is correct. I'm not entirely sure on part c (this IS the intersection, right? Is it simply just multiplying the two probabilities together, or is there something I'm missing? The formula below part c makes me nervous I'm missing something). A coin is flipped 10 times. a) What is the probability that there are exactly five heads and five tails? b) What is the probability that the first three flips are heads? c) What is the probability that there are exactly five heads and five tails AND the first three flips are heads? d) What is the probability that there are exactly five heads and five tails OR the first three flips are heads? Let $(S, P)$ be a sample space such that $$S = \{(a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{10}) : a_1 \in \{H, T\}\}$$ and $P(S) = \frac{1}{2^{10}}$ for all $s \in S$. a) By definition, $|S| = 1024$. Let $E$ be the event that we get 5 heads (so the other five flips are tails). Then $|E| = $$10 \choose 5$, because we are choosing 5 of the 10 flips to be heads. Since all outcomes are equally likely, $P(E) = \frac{|E|}{|S|} = \frac{252}{1024}$. b) For each of the first three flps, there is a $\frac{1}{2}$ chance that each one will be heads. By the multiplication principle, the probability that the first three flips are heads is $\frac{1}{2^3} = \frac{1}{8}$. c) From part $a$, we know that the probability of exactly five heads and five tails is $\frac{252}{1024}$. From part $b$, we know the probability that the first three flips are heads is $\frac{1}{8}$. So the probability of both is $A \cap B = P(A) * P(B) = \frac{63}{2048}$ (defining $A$ as the event of exactly five heads and tails, and $B$ as the event of the first three flips being heads). d) We have the formula $$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$$. Using our $A$ and $B$ events from part $c$, $P(A) = \frac{252}{1024}$, $P(B) = \frac{1}{8}$, and $P(A \cap B) = \frac{63}{2048}$. So we have that $$P(A \cup B) = \frac{252}{1024} + \frac{1}{8} - \frac{63}{2048} = \frac{697}{2048}$$.","I'm fresh into probability and I think it's important to ask a lot of questions since it seems probability really challenges your intuition.

A coin is flipped 10 times. a) What is the probability that there are exactly five heads and five tails? b) What is the probability that the first three flips are heads? c) What is the probability that there are exactly five heads and five tails AND the first three flips are heads? d) What is the probability that there are exactly five heads and five tails OR the first three flips are heads? Let $(S, P)$ be a sample space such that $$S = \{(a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{10}) : a_1 \in \{H, T\}\}$$ and $P(S) = \frac{1}{2^{10}}$ for all $s \in S$. a) By definition, $|S| = 1024$. Let $E$ be the event that we get 5 heads (so the other five flips are tails). Then $|E| = $$10 \choose 5$, because we are choosing 5 of the 10 flips to be heads. Since all outcomes are equally likely, $P(E) = \frac{|E|}{|S|} = \frac{252}{1024}$. b) For each of the first three flps, there is a $\frac{1}{2}$ chance that each one will be heads. By the multiplication principle, the probability that the first three flips are heads is $\frac{1}{2^3} = \frac{1}{8}$. c) From part $a$, we know that the probability of exactly five heads and five tails is $\frac{252}{1024}$. From part $b$, we know the probability that the first three flips are heads is $\frac{1}{8}$. So the probability of both is $A \cap B = P(A) * P(B) = \frac{63}{2048}$ (defining $A$ as the event of exactly five heads and tails, and $B$ as the event of the first three flips being heads). d) We have the formula $$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$$. Using our $A$ and $B$ events from part $c$, $P(A) = \frac{252}{1024}$, $P(B) = \frac{1}{8}$, and $P(A \cap B) = \frac{63}{2048}$. So we have that $$P(A \cup B) = \frac{252}{1024} + \frac{1}{8} - \frac{63}{2048} = \frac{697}{2048}$$.",,"['probability', 'discrete-mathematics', 'proof-verification']"

So there are: $$\begin{align} N(C^{\complement}) & =|\{\text{words of length $7$ on the set  $\{u,v,w,x,y,z\}$}|-N(C_4)-N(C_5)-N(C_6)-N(C_7) \\ &=6^7-4\cdot5^3-3\cdot5^2-2\cdot5^1-1 \end{align}$$ Am I way off here or do I have the right idea?",,['discrete-mathematics']

I will use a specific example to demonstrate and present my attempt at a proof with questions following. Suppose we have a recurrence relation $T(n)$ defined as follows \begin{align*} 	T(0) &= 0 \\ 	T(n) &= T\left(\left\lfloor n/3\right\rfloor\right) + T\left(\left\lfloor n/5\right\rfloor\right) + T\left(\left\lfloor n/7\right\rfloor\right) + n, \enspace n > 0 \end{align*} Use Strong Induction to prove that $T(n) \in O(n)$. Proof: $\underline{\text{Base Case}}$: By definition of BigOh, we want to show that $\exists c > 0 \enspace \text{s.t.} \enspace T(n) \le cn, \enspace \forall n \ge n_0$. Since $T(0) = 0$, this holds for any choice of $c$ with $n=0$ and $n_0 = 0$. $\underline{\text{Inductive Hypothesis (I.H.)}}$: Suppose there exists such a $c$ for all $0 \le n < k$. $\underline{\text{Inductive Step}}$: We need to show that $T(n) \in O(n)$ for $n = k$. Since $\lfloor k/3 \rfloor,\lfloor k/5 \rfloor,\lfloor k/7 \rfloor < k$, it follows by the I.H. that $T(\lfloor k/3 \rfloor) \le ck/3$, $T(\lfloor k/5 \rfloor) \le ck/5$, and $T(\lfloor k/7 \rfloor) \le ck/7$. Then using the definition of $T(n)$ we can say that \begin{align*} T(k) &\le \frac{ck}{3} + \frac{ck}{5} + \frac{ck}{7} + k\\ &\le ck\left(\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{c}\right) \end{align*} To prove that $T(n) \in O(n)$ for $n=k$, we need to show that this quantity is less than $ck$ as follows \begin{align*} ck\left(\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{c}\right) &\le ck \\ \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{c} &\le 1 \\ \frac{71}{105} + \frac{1}{c} &\le 1 \\ \frac{1}{c} &\le \frac{34}{105} \\ c &\le \frac{105}{34} \end{align*} So for any $c \ge 105/34$, $T(n) \in O(n)$ for $n = k$, and thus $T(n) \in O(n)$. Questions: What is the particular reason that strong induction is necessary for this proof? Is it because $T(n)$ is defined in terms of three previous recursive instances with floor functions that don't follow the same $+1$ ordering as the natural numbers? Or does it relate to proving asymptotic complexity where a claim $P(n)$ involves $\forall n \ge n_0$ for each $n$? Is my base case sufficient? Since BigOh typically applies to asymptotic limits, I have trouble understanding how to prove BigOh for a base case when $n$ takes on a specific value. Are there any issues with my attempted proof? Don't hold back, I would appreciate some formal criticism.","I have some questions about Strong Induction where the inductive procedure isn't entirely clear to me. I will use a specific example to demonstrate and present my attempt at a proof with questions following. Suppose we have a recurrence relation $T(n)$ defined as follows \begin{align*} 	T(0) &= 0 \\ 	T(n) &= T\left(\left\lfloor n/3\right\rfloor\right) + T\left(\left\lfloor n/5\right\rfloor\right) + T\left(\left\lfloor n/7\right\rfloor\right) + n, \enspace n > 0 \end{align*} Use Strong Induction to prove that $T(n) \in O(n)$. Proof: $\underline{\text{Base Case}}$: By definition of BigOh, we want to show that $\exists c > 0 \enspace \text{s.t.} \enspace T(n) \le cn, \enspace \forall n \ge n_0$. Since $T(0) = 0$, this holds for any choice of $c$ with $n=0$ and $n_0 = 0$. $\underline{\text{Inductive Hypothesis (I.H.)}}$: Suppose there exists such a $c$ for all $0 \le n < k$. $\underline{\text{Inductive Step}}$: We need to show that $T(n) \in O(n)$ for $n = k$. Since $\lfloor k/3 \rfloor,\lfloor k/5 \rfloor,\lfloor k/7 \rfloor < k$, it follows by the I.H. that $T(\lfloor k/3 \rfloor) \le ck/3$, $T(\lfloor k/5 \rfloor) \le ck/5$, and $T(\lfloor k/7 \rfloor) \le ck/7$. Then using the definition of $T(n)$ we can say that \begin{align*} T(k) &\le \frac{ck}{3} + \frac{ck}{5} + \frac{ck}{7} + k\\ &\le ck\left(\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{c}\right) \end{align*} To prove that $T(n) \in O(n)$ for $n=k$, we need to show that this quantity is less than $ck$ as follows \begin{align*} ck\left(\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{c}\right) &\le ck \\ \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{c} &\le 1 \\ \frac{71}{105} + \frac{1}{c} &\le 1 \\ \frac{1}{c} &\le \frac{34}{105} \\ c &\le \frac{105}{34} \end{align*} So for any $c \ge 105/34$, $T(n) \in O(n)$ for $n = k$, and thus $T(n) \in O(n)$.
