However, here I have $x$ on the RHS.","Exercise Prove the statement using the $\epsilon$, $\delta$ definition of a limit:   $$\lim \limits_{x \to 3}{(x^2+x-4)} = 8$$ The Precise Definition of a Limit In case you're not familiar with the definition of ""The Precise Definition of a Limit"", here it is. Let $f$ be a function defined on some open interval that contains the number $a$, except possible $a$ itself. Then we say that the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$ is $L$, and we write   $$\lim \limits_{x \to a}{f(x)} = L$$   if for every number $\epsilon > 0$ there is a number $\delta > 0$ such that   $$\text{if } 0 < |x - a| < \delta \text{ then } |f(x) - L| < \epsilon$$ Attempt $\lim \limits_{x \to 3}{(x^2+x-4)} = 8 \implies \text{if } 0 < |x - 3| < \delta \text{ then } |x^2+x-4 - 8| < \epsilon$ $|x^2+x-4 - 8| < \epsilon \implies |x^2+x-12| < \epsilon \implies |(x-3)(x+4)| < \epsilon$ From here, I quickly get lost. I notice that $|(x-3)(x+4)| < \epsilon \implies |x-3||x+4| < \epsilon \implies |x-3| < \frac{\epsilon}{|x+4|}$, which means that $\delta = \frac{\epsilon}{|x+4|}$. In the other exercises, I often end the proof here, because I've solved for $\delta$ purely in terms of $\epsilon$. However, here I have $x$ on the RHS.",,"['calculus', 'limits', 'functions']"

We will add $C$ to the function and it will become $y = (x+C)^2$ and if we have to shift Graph to right side $C$ points, then we will subtract $C$ from function, and the equation will become $y = (x-C)^2$, and similarly add $C$ to the $f(x)$ and subtract $C$ from $f(x)$ if we want to shift graph upwards $C$ points and downwards $C$ points respectively, and if we want to reflect it about $x$-axis, we will multiply $f(x)$ with minus ""-"" sign and if we want to reflect it about $y$-axis we will multiply the function with minus""-"" sign thats makes it like $y = f(-x)$.

For the first one it says to supposed that $g: \Bbb{N} \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ is a bijection, define $b(k) = 1 - g(k)(k)$, then $b(k)$ is not in the image of $g(k)$ by the ways its constructed but I don't understand why $b(k)$ is an element of $2^{\Bbb{N}}$, I understand that $g(k)$ will evaluate to $0$ or $1$ but $g(k)(k)$ is not necessarily one or zero, it could be $g(20)(20) = 1*20 = 20$ for example. For the second question, it says to show that $F(f) = \{ n \in \Bbb{N} : f(n) = 1\}$ is a bijection $F(f): 2^{\Bbb{N}} \rightarrow P(\Bbb{N})$. I can see how the function is surjective, since by construction for every $n \in \Bbb{N} \ \exists f(n) \in 2^{\Bbb{N}}$ s.t. $f(n) = 1$, but I can not see how $F(f(n))$ is injective, if $f(n) = 0$, then that $n$ doesn't get mapped into $\Bbb{N}$, in this case wouldn't $F(f(n))$ just be the empty set, suppose for a certain $n \in \Bbb{N}$ there exists not function $f$, s.t. $f(n) = 1$, then wouldn't that n never be in $P(\Bbb{N})$.
