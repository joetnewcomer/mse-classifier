However, proofs are rigorous processes (for a good reason) and are more than just ""that idea looks like it could make sense"". I've seen proofs for many different things, including in calculus, but I have yet to come across a proof for the formula of the surface of revolution $$ A=2\pi\int_{a}^{b}y\, \sqrt{\,1 + \left(\frac{{\rm d}y}{{\rm d}x}\right)^{\vphantom{\large A}2}\,}\, \,{\rm d}x $$ It obviously ""makes sense"", when you think about how you're unwrapping thin rectangular strips from the circles and adding them all up.

40,Find estimates for the solution $x=x_n$ of the equation $(1+x)^n =1+(n+1)x$,Find estimates for the solution  of the equation,x=x_n (1+x)^n =1+(n+1)x,"It is clear that for every $n> 0$ , and $\delta> 0$ ,  we have $(1+x)^n < 1+ (n+\delta) x$ , for $x>0$ small. In particular we have $(1+x)^n< 1 + (n+1) x$ for $x> 0$ small enough.  How small is just the question.  I have approximated the logs on both sides with their quadratic terms and got $x_n\simeq \frac{2}{n^2+n+1}$ for the solution of the equation $$(1+x_n)^n = 1+(n+1) x_n$$ Now it turns out that we  have $$x_n > \frac{2}{n^2}$$ equivalently $$\left(1+\frac{2}{n^2}\right)^n < 1+\frac{2(n+1)}{n^2}$$ This is not hard to show with some calculus ( take the second derivative). I am   interested in better estimates for $x_n$ defined above. I am thinking about large $n$ 's Any feedback would be appreciated! Got some great feedback. @Somos solution finds it as a power series in $\frac{1}{n}$ .  It seems that all of the coefficients are positive.  I wonder how one could prove that. Also @Somos expressed the problem as an inversion of a function. In @Claude Leibovici solution it seems we find the Pade approximants.  They themselves have expansion in $\frac{1}{n}$ with positive coefficients it seems.  Intriguing. This is still evolving.  The way I see it now: Let $t = \frac{1}{n}$ , $t$ small.  Also take $k$ a parameter ( assumed positive). The equation in $x$ with parameters $k$ and $t$ $$(1+ x)^{\frac{1}{t}} - (1 + (\frac{1}{t} + k) x)$$ has a solution for $x$ that is approximately $2 k t^2$ .  So write $x = 2 k t^2 \cdot y$ and consider the equation in $y$ $$\frac{ \log( 1+ 2 k t^2 y) - t \log (1 + (\frac{1}{t} + k) 2 k t^2 y)}{t^3} =0$$ or $f(k,t,y) = 0$ .  In this setup $f$ is analytic (in $k$ , $t$ , $y$ ), $f(k, 0, 1) = 0$ , and moreover, $\frac{\partial f(k,0,1)}{\partial y} = 2 k^2 \ne 0$ (if $k\ne 0$ ).  So now we  get a solution $$x= x(t) = 2 k t^2[ 1+ \frac{1}{3}( 3 - 2k)t + \frac{1}{9} ( 9+ 5 k^2) + \frac{1}{135}( 135 + 90 k - 30 k^2 - 68 k^3)t^3 + \cdots ]$$ This series is convergent for small $t$ . For $k=1$ ( the original problem) it seems the coefficients are positive, still not elucidated. With calculus ( using the known series expansion of @Somos) we could show that $$x(t) = x(1,t) > 2 t^2( 1 + 1/3 t + 14 /9 t^2)$$ by showing that $$f(t) \colon = t \log ( 1+ (\frac{1}{t} + 1)2 t^2( 1 + 1/3 t + 14/9 t^2)) - \log ( 1 + 2 t^2( 1 + 1/3 t + 14/9 t^2))>0$$ For this, check that $f(0) = f'(0) = 0$ , and $f''(t) > 0$ for $t> 0$ ( see this WA link )","It is clear that for every , and ,  we have , for small.

Thus the transformation Jacobi determinant is $\partial(x,y)/\partial(r,\theta)=r$, and $$\int_{\Omega_1}(x^2+y^2)dxdy=\int_{D_{r\theta}}r^2\cdot rdrd\theta\quad D_{r\theta}:=\{(r,\theta)\mid \theta\in[0,\frac{\pi}{2}]\wedge r\in[0,(\cos^4\theta+\sin^4\theta)^{-1/4}]\}$$ After some simple adjustment I got $$\int_{D_{r\theta}}r^2\cdot rdrd\theta=\frac14\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\frac{d\theta}{\sin^4\theta+\cos^4\theta}=\frac14\frac{\pi}{\sqrt 2}$$ which was also confirmed by Maple. Therefore $$\int_{\Omega}(x^2+y^2)dxdy=\frac{\pi}{\sqrt 2}$$ However, when I switch to another approach: directly applying Fubini's Theorem, the result seems to be different.

This meant $$ \int \frac{xdx}{x^2\sqrt{1-x^2}} = \int \frac{-u du}{u (1-u^2)} = \int \frac{-du}{ 1-u^2} = -\int \frac{du}{1-u^2} $$ For the integral $\int \frac{du}{1-u^2}$, I set $u = \sin \theta$ which meant $du = \cos\theta. d\theta$ which implied  $$ \int \frac{du}{1-u^2} = \int \frac{\cos\theta}{1 -\sin^2\theta}d\theta = \int\sec\theta\,d\theta = \log|\sec \theta + \tan \theta| = \log|\frac{1+\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}| $$ Now, since $u = \sin \theta$ in the last substitution and $\sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta = 1$ it follows that $\cos\theta = \sqrt{1-u^2}$ which means $$ \log|\frac{1+\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}| = \log |\frac{1+u}{\sqrt{1-u^2}}| $$ $$ = \log|\frac{1+u}{\sqrt{1-u}\sqrt{1+u}}| $$ $$ = \log|\frac{\sqrt{1+u}}{\sqrt{1-u}}| = \frac{1}{2}\log|\frac{1+u}{1-u}| $$ That is $$ \int \frac{du}{1-u^2} =\frac{1}{2}\log|\frac{1+u}{1-u}| $$ Now, in the first substitution $u^2 = 1 - x^2$ implies $u = \sqrt{1-x^2}$ which means $$ \frac{1}{2}\log|\frac{1+u}{1-u}| = \frac{1}{2}\log|\frac{1+ \sqrt{1-x^2}}{1 - \sqrt{1-x^2}}| $$ $$ = \frac{1}{2}\log|\frac{(1+\sqrt{1-x^2})(1+\sqrt{1-x^2})}{(1 - \sqrt{1-x^2})(1+\sqrt{1-x^2})}| $$ $$ = \frac{1}{2}\log|\frac{2 - x^2 +2\sqrt{1-x^2}}{x^2}| $$ $$ = \log|\frac{1+\sqrt{1-x^2}}{x}| $$ That is $$ \int \frac{xdx}{x^2\sqrt{1-x^2}} = - \log|\frac{1+\sqrt{1-x^2}}{x}| $$ with respect to the original integral means $$ \int \frac {\arcsin x}{x^2}dx = -\frac{\arcsin x}{x} -  \log|\frac{1+\sqrt{1-x^2}}{x}| + C $$ which is not the answer as stated in Apostol's book.

This meant $$ \int \frac{xdx}{x^2\sqrt{1-x^2}} = \int \frac{-u du}{u (1-u^2)} = \int \frac{-du}{ 1-u^2} = -\int \frac{du}{1-u^2} $$ For the integral $\int \frac{du}{1-u^2}$, I set $u = \sin \theta$ which meant $du = \cos\theta. d\theta$ which implied  $$ \int \frac{du}{1-u^2} = \int \frac{\cos\theta}{1 -\sin^2\theta}d\theta = \int\sec\theta\,d\theta = \log|\sec \theta + \tan \theta| = \log|\frac{1+\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}| $$ Now, since $u = \sin \theta$ in the last substitution and $\sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta = 1$ it follows that $\cos\theta = \sqrt{1-u^2}$ which means $$ \log|\frac{1+\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}| = \log |\frac{1+u}{\sqrt{1-u^2}}| $$ $$ = \log|\frac{1+u}{\sqrt{1-u}\sqrt{1+u}}| $$ $$ = \log|\frac{\sqrt{1+u}}{\sqrt{1-u}}| = \frac{1}{2}\log|\frac{1+u}{1-u}| $$ That is $$ \int \frac{du}{1-u^2} =\frac{1}{2}\log|\frac{1+u}{1-u}| $$ Now, in the first substitution $u^2 = 1 - x^2$ implies $u = \sqrt{1-x^2}$ which means $$ \frac{1}{2}\log|\frac{1+u}{1-u}| = \frac{1}{2}\log|\frac{1+ \sqrt{1-x^2}}{1 - \sqrt{1-x^2}}| $$ $$ = \frac{1}{2}\log|\frac{(1+\sqrt{1-x^2})(1+\sqrt{1-x^2})}{(1 - \sqrt{1-x^2})(1+\sqrt{1-x^2})}| $$ $$ = \frac{1}{2}\log|\frac{2 - x^2 +2\sqrt{1-x^2}}{x^2}| $$ $$ = \log|\frac{1+\sqrt{1-x^2}}{x}| $$ That is $$ \int \frac{xdx}{x^2\sqrt{1-x^2}} = - \log|\frac{1+\sqrt{1-x^2}}{x}| $$ with respect to the original integral means $$ \int \frac {\arcsin x}{x^2}dx = -\frac{\arcsin x}{x} -  \log|\frac{1+\sqrt{1-x^2}}{x}| + C $$ which is not the answer as stated in Apostol's book.
