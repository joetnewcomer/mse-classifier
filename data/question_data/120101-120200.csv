This problem seemed fairly simple.

How many small disks are needed to cover the large disc completely? I assume they ask for the minimal number of small disks. So, to cover the plane with disks with ""minimal overlapping"" we have to do something like: The question is how to place the large disk on this picture so that it overlaps with the least amount of small disks. If we place the large disk so that its middlepoint is in the middle as so: then it overlaps with all the $12$ small circles on the picture but I recon we can do better. If we shift the large disk so its centerpoint coincides with one of the small disks' then it will overlap with $9$ small disks. this looks minimal, but I have a hard time finding a rigorous way showing this.

I was always wanted to find a simple definition of a self-similar fractal. Of course, saying ""is self-similar, and is a fractal (has noninteger fractal dimension)"" is a valid definition, but not the one I was looking for. So here I go. A shape $S$ in euclidean space is a self-similar fractal if: It is self similar (this definition seems as suitable as any, but feel free to use another if you prefer). It does not tessellate the plane (if it does, it is trivially self-similar). For example, the square is self-similar (if you remove the right and bottom edge), but it also tessellates the plane. A line segment too is self similar, and, using an uncountable number of lines it can tessellate the plane. An octagon can not tessellate the plane, but it is not self-similar. So these things are not fractals. Sierpinski's triangle is self-similar but can not tessellate the plane. The Koch Curve is also self-similar and can not tessellate the plane (if you try the same trick with the line, it will necessarily intersect itself). My question is, is the above definition equivalent to being a fractal and being strictly self-similar in the plane? Does it work in other euclidean dimensions?

57,Definite solution for the mean distance from an external point to the surface of a sphere.,Definite solution for the mean distance from an external point to the surface of a sphere.,,"Sphere, radius $E$, is centred at point $O$ $[0,0,0]$. External point $Q$ is at $[D,0,0]$. I can slice the sphere by making multiple planar cuts parallel to the $YZ$ plane to produce circular zones (quasi-discs) of equal infinitessimal width $dx$ and position $x_i$.  The curved surface of each zone has the same surface area.  The radius $R_i$ of any zone $i$ lies in the $YZ$ plane and has magnitude: $R_i = \sqrt{E^2 - x_i^2}  .$ The distance $L_i$ from point $Q$ to any point $P_i$ in the zone $i$ is given by:- $$L_i = \sqrt{ (D-x_i)^2 + R_i^2}   = \sqrt{ D^2 -2Dx_i + x_i^2 + E^2 - x_i^2}  = \sqrt{ D^2 -2Dx_i + E^2 } $$ $$L_i  = D \sqrt{ 1 -\frac{2x_i}{D} + \frac{E^2}{D^2} }. $$ Now I wish to integrate this expression over the range $-E\cdots+E$ and then divide by $2E$ to obtain the average value $\bar{L}$ thus $$\bar{L} = \frac{D}{2E} \int_{-E}^{+E} \sqrt{ 1 -\frac{2x_i}{D} + \frac{E^2}{D^2} } dx.$$ I can make a Taylor Series approximation of the square root term using the standard formula $(1+x)^{0.5} = 1 + x/2 - x^2/8 + x^3/16 -\cdots$ Applying this to the square root term I obtain $$ \sqrt{ 1 -\frac{2x_i}{D} + \frac{E^2}{D^2} } = 1-x_i/D + (1/2)E^2/D^2 -(1/2)x_i^2/D^2 + (1/2)x_iE^2/D^3  + \cdots$$ where the subsequent terms on the RHS diminish in magnitude.  By dropping terms with odd powers of $x_i$ (because they will go to zero when integrating over the range $-E \le x_i \le +E$ ) and consolidating and integrating I come up with the following approximate result:- $$\bar{L} = \frac{D}{2E} \int_{-E}^{+E} \sqrt{ 1 -\frac{2x_i}{D} + \frac{E^2}{D^2} } dx \approx D\left(1 + \frac{E^2}{3D^2} + A\right) $$ where A is a small term whose expression depends on the number of terms evaluated in the Taylor series approximation.

I know that: the conjugate of a reflection by a translation (or by any isometry, for that matter) is another reflection, by some explicitly calculation (haven't try). And 3 reflections leads to glide. So I was thinking write a glide as 3 reflections and using the same process as proving 1 to prove the statement here. Is this promising? Can someone tell me?

93,Proving a point inside a triangle is no further away than the longest side divided by $\sqrt{3}$,Proving a point inside a triangle is no further away than the longest side divided by,\sqrt{3},"Problem: In a triangle $T$ , all the angles are less than 90 degrees, and the longest side has length $s$ . Show that for every point $p$ in $T$ we can pick a corner $h$ in $T$ such that the distance from $p$ to $h$ is less than or equal to $s/\sqrt{3}$ . Source: Problem 2 in http://abelkonkurransen.no/problems/abel_1213_f_prob_en.pdf Here's my try: If $p$ is on any of the edges of $T$ , it can't be further away than $s/2$ . Then I thought that the point furthest away from any $h$ would be a point equidistant to all the vertices. I also know that the equidistant point has to be inside the triangle because no angle is obtuse. I am assuming an equilateral triangle (I'm not sure if I can). It has no longest side, therefore all must be of length $s$ . Let $h_1,h_2,h_3$ be the vertices, and $z=h_1e=h_2e=h_3e$ . To find the equidistant point $e$ , I could half all the angles. By trigonometry I will get that, $\cos 30^\circ=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}=\frac{s/2}{z} \implies z=\frac{s}{\sqrt{3}}$ . Since this is the length from the closest corner to the equidistant point it cannot be further away. I am not sure if I can rightly assume the triangle is equilateral without loss of generality, probably not. However this is the closest I've gotten to proving this. Could you explain a better approach? PS. Calculators would not be allowed.","Problem: In a triangle , all the angles are less than 90 degrees, and the longest side has length .

94,Ratio of Circumference to Diameter on a sphere,Ratio of Circumference to Diameter on a sphere,,"I was listening to an audiobook of Einstein when they started discussing spherical geometry and how Pi was no longer the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, so I set out to find the answer.  From what I gathered, it is a variable that depends on an angle $\theta$ between the pole and the circle in question, since there are infinite parallel circles on a sphere. So the circumference I calculated through Euclidean methods would be $2\pi$ times the length of a side of a triangle opposite $\theta$.  If $r$ is the radius of the sphere, then we can find this two dimensional circles's radius as  $$x=r\sin\theta.$$ So the circumference, $C_{\theta}$, then is $2\pi\cdot{r}\sin\theta$ Now we need the radius, which is the arc length from the pole, $\frac{\pi}{2}$ to $\sin\theta$.  Using parametrization of  $$\mathbf{x}(t)=(r\cos{t},r\sin{t}),$$ The arclength would just be $$\rho_{\theta}=\int_{\sin{\theta}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}||\mathbf{x}(t)||dt=\int_{\sin{\theta}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}rdt=r\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-\sin\theta\right)$$ Multiplying by 2 gives us our diameter So I think that this is the function in $\theta$ that gives us the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter; $$R(\theta)=\frac{2\pi\cdot{r}\sin\theta}{2r\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-\sin\theta\right)}=\frac{\pi\sin\theta}{\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-\sin\theta\right)}$$ Is this a correct approach? Edit; I can see my lower bound for my arclength integral was completely off, as it was 2 in the morning here when I was figuring this out....  The upper bound would be $\frac{\pi}{2}$ and my lower bound would be $\frac{\pi}{2}-\theta$.

Geometrically, these curves are confined to the surface of the unit $n$-sphere. A subset of these curves are geodesics, i.e. they trace the great circles of the unit $n$-sphere. I would like to know the answers to the following two questions: Given a matrix $H$, how could one tell whether it represents a great circle when plugged in to the above equation? I.e. do the matrices corresponding to geodesics have some special properties in terms of their elements, eigenvalues, etc.? Is there an accepted term for such matrices? More importantly: given the coordinates of two points on the unit $n$-circle, how can I find a Hermitian matrix $H$ that corresponds the great circle that passes through both points?

Note: my actual problem is regarding curves in a real vector space of the form $|\psi\rangle(t) = e^{At}|\psi_0\rangle$, where $A$ is antisymmetric.
