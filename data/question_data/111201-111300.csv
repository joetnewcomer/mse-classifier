0,How to find subgroups of a product group containing the diagonal?,How to find subgroups of a product group containing the diagonal?,,"Given a non-abelian group $G,$ I am curious about subgroups of $G\times G$ containing the diagonal $\{(a, a)\mid a\in G\}.$ As a starting point, I thought of looking at the simplest examples $S_3$ and $D_8$ . Direct computations quickly become tedious as the product group is a bit large. Also, I think Goursat's lemma could be helpful, but don't know how to use it for an explicit calculation.

In that case if ${\bar D}:\mathfrak{su}(N)\to {\operatorname{End}}(V)$ is one anti-hermitian representation of $\mathfrak{su}(N)$ they define $D : {\rm SU}(N)\to \operatorname{GL}(V)$ by $$D(\exp X)=\exp {\bar D}(X)\tag{1}.$$ Now, I have a problem with this.

The case $p=2$ I could prove it. Let $V=\langle a,b\rangle$ be the 4-group, $F$ free on $X=\{x,y\}, f:X\to V, x\mapsto a, y\mapsto b$ . Then there exists $\varphi:F\to V$ such that $\varphi\mid X=f$ . $\varphi$ is onto because $V=\langle a,b\rangle$ . Let $\Delta=\{x^2,y^2,(xy)^2\}$ . Then $x^2\varphi=a^2=1, y^2\varphi=b^2=1, (xy)^2\varphi=[(xy)\varphi]^2=(ab)^2=1$ . So $\Delta \subseteq$ ker $\varphi$ and $R=\Delta^F\le$ ker $\varphi\le F$ .

30,Group theory optimization; abstract algebra relevant?,Group theory optimization; abstract algebra relevant?,,"Suppose a girl, call her Alice is lost from home. Where all her geographical surroundings, including both herself and the position of her house can be modeled as particular vertices in a graph $G$ such that each edge in $G$ corresponds with a road that Alice can walk down as she attempts to find her way home. However Alice is on the phone with her friend Bob, who is trying to give her directions to get back home based on what she tells him of her current surroundings, yet Alice can only see those vertices directly adjacent to her and so Bob must try his best based on her description of where she is to help her navigate back home. Now my goal is to optimize the graph $G$ to make it as hard as possible for Alice to get home. After rethinking this several times, I can't help but think it involves group theory which seems weird in this particular context as I've not used abstract algebra in related problems of this nature before. Though in any case my train of thought was: Try to design a graph based on the constraints I was given, such that knowing the neighbors of any vertex gives as little structural information about that vertices positions relative to the graph as a whole, in this way since Alice can only see geographic objects adjacent to her, a graph satisfying this property would ensure Alice conveys as little information about her position as possible to Bob. However if the graph has a large automorphism group, or is ""vertex transitive"" then since any vertex can be mapped to any other vertex via a bijective map. This would make the positions (vertices) essentially indistinguishable up to the objects (vertices ) adjacent to Alice's position. So I'm thinking the more ""transitive"" I make the graphs automorphism group, the less information Alice will have about her geographic position relative to $G$, which means less info can be given to Bob, which means Alice will likely remain lost longer being unable to give much of a description of her surroundings based on the structure of adjacent vertices.

91,When is the word metric on a finitely generated group right-invariant?,When is the word metric on a finitely generated group right-invariant?,,"Let $G$ be a finitely generated group with finite generator $S$ , and define the metric $ d_S : G \times G \to \mathbb{Z} \cap [0, \infty)$ by $$d_S(x, y) = \min \left\{ \ell \geq 0 : \exists s_1, \ldots, s_\ell \in \left( S \cup S^{-1} \right) \setminus \left\{ e \right\} \; \left( x^{-1} y = s_1 \cdots s_\ell \right) \right\} ,$$ i.e. $d_S$ is the word metric associated to $S$ . The metric $d$ will automatically be left-invariant, i.e. $d_S(x, y) = d_S(gx, gy)$ for all $g, x, y \in G$ , since $(g x)^{-1} (g y) = x^{-1} g^{-1} g y = x^{-1} y$ . However, this metric need not always be right-invariant. For an example of the word metric not being right-invariant, consider the example of $G = F_2$ , i.e. the free group on two generators, with (free) generator $S = \{a, b\}$ . Then $d_S(e, b) = 1$ , but $d_S(e a, b a) = d_S \left( e, a^{-1} b a \right) = 3$ , so the ""canonical"" word metric on the free group with two generators is not right-invariant. On the other hand, if $G$ is abelian, then every word metric is right-invariant. Right-invariance is equivalent to the conjugation action $g \cdot x = g^{-1} x g$ of $G$ on itself satisfying $d_S(e, g \cdot x) = d_S(e, x)$ for all $g, x \in G$ , since $d_S (xg , y g) = d\left(e, g^{-1} y g \right)$ . So conjugation needs to preserve word length, and of course the conjugation action for an abelian group is trivial. Alternatively, if $G$ is finite, and $S = G$ , then $d_S$ is the discrete metric (i.e. $d_S(x, y) = \delta(x, y)$ ), and thus is also right-invariant. This trick works for any discrete group if we drop our assumption that $S$ be finite, but I'd rather consider the finite generator case. My question: is there a straightforward characterization of when the word metric is both left- and right-invariant? My guess would be that every word metric is right-invariant if and only if $G$ is abelian, but I can't prove this either. This seems like the kind of problem that should be elementary to solve, but alas, I haven't solved it. Alternatively, is there some sense in which the word metric will be ""almost right-invariant"", where we can place bounds on the extent to which the word metric fails to be right-invariant? Thanks in advance for your help! EDIT 1: Here's a partial answer based on @Mariano Suárez-Álvarez's suggestion, at the end of which are some related follow-up questions. Claim: Let $S$ be a finite generator for $G$ , and set $\tilde{S} = \left(S \cup S^{-1} \right) \setminus \{e\}$ . Let $g \star x = g^{-1} x g$ be the action of $G$ on itself by conjugation (note: this is a right action which I foolishly wrote on the left; thanks @Captain Lama for pointing this out). Then $d_S$ is right-invariant if and only if $s \star t \in \tilde{S}$ for all $s, t \in \tilde{S}$ . Proof: The necessity is obvious, since if there existed $s, t \in \tilde{S}$ for which $s \star t \not \in \tilde{S}$ , then we'd have $d_S(s, t s) = d_S \left( e, s \star t \right) \neq 1 = d_S (e, t)$ . Now we claim it's sufficient. First, we remark that if $\tilde{S}$ is closed under conjugation by itself, then $\tilde{S}$ is closed under conjugation by all elements of $G$ , i.e. $g \cdot s \in \tilde{S}$ for all $s \in \tilde{S}, g \in G$ . This follows by writing an arbitrary element $g$ of $G$ as a product of elements of $\tilde{S}$ and applying an inductive argument. Moreover, we remark that if $\tilde{S}$ is closed under conjugation, then $|x \star y| \leq |y|$ for all $x, y \in G$ , where $|\cdot|$ denotes word length. Let $x = s_1 \cdots s_\ell, y = t_1 \cdots t_m$ , where $s_i, t_j \in \tilde{S}$ and $|y| = m$ . Then \begin{align*} |x \star y| & = |x \star (t_1 \cdots t_m)| \\ & = |(x \star t_1) \cdots (x \star t_m)| \\ & = \left| t_1' \right| \cdots \left| t_m' \right| \\ & = m & = |y| , \end{align*} where $t_j' = x \star t_j \in \tilde{S}$ . Thus conjugation cannot increase word length. We claim, however, that conjugation preserves word length, i.e. that $|x \star y| = |y|$ for all $x, y \in G$ . Assume for contradiction that there exist $x, y \in G$ such that $|x \star y| < |y|$ . Let $y' = x \star y$ . Then $\left| x^{-1} \star y' \right| = |y| > \left|y'\right|$ . This contradicts our earlier claim that $\left|z \star w\right| \leq |w|$ for all $z, w \in G$ . Thus if $\tilde{S}$ is closed under conjugation, then conjugation preserves word length. From here, it follows that if $x, y, g \in G$ , then $$d_S(x g, y g) = \left| (x g)^{-1} (yg) \right| = \left| g^{-1} x^{-1} y g \right| = \left| g \star \left( x^{-1} y \right) \right| = \left| x^{-1} y \right| = d_S(x, y) .$$ This concludes the proof. This criterion encompasses some non-abelian groups. For example, as we mentioned, every finite group can be realized in this way by taking $S = G \setminus \{e\}$ . This proof can be elaborate on to show the word metric is ""almost right-invariant"" in the sense of ""Lie Groups and Error Analysis"" by Schiff and Shnider: Set $$M = \max_{s, t \in \tilde{S}} |s \star t| \in \mathbb{N} .$$ For each $g \in G$ , set $\rho(g) = M^{|g|}$ . Consider $x, y \in G$ , and let $g = s_1 \cdots s_\ell, x^{-1} y = t_1 \cdots t_m$ for $s_i t_j \in \tilde{S}$ , where $\ell = |g|, m = \left| x^{-1} y \right| = d_S(x, y)$ . Then \begin{align*} d_S(x g, y g) & = \left| g \star \left( x^{-1} y \right) \right| \\  & = \left| (g \star t_1) \cdots (g \star t_m) \right| \\  & \leq |g \star t_1| + \cdots + |g \star t_m| \\  & = \sum_{j = 1}^m |(s_1 \cdots s_\ell) \cdot t_j| . \end{align*} Applying an inductive argument, we can conclude that $|(s_1 \cdots s_\ell) \cdot t_j| \leq M^\ell$ for all $j$ , so \begin{align*} d_S(x g, y g) & \leq \sum_{j = 1}^m |(s_1 \cdots s_\ell) \cdot t_j| \\  & \leq \sum_{j = 1}^m M^\ell \\  & = M^\ell \cdot m \\  & = M^{|g|} \left| x^{-1} y \right| & = M^{|g|} d_S(x, y) . \end{align*} Edit 2: As @Sean Eberhard pointed out, this estimate can be cleaned up significantly to get \begin{align*} d_S(x g, y g) & = \left| g^{-1} \left( x^{-1} y \right) g \right| \\  & \leq \left| g^{-1} \right| + d_S(x, y) + |g| \\  & = 2|g| + d_S(x, y) \\  & \leq (2|g| + 1) d_S(x, y) , \end{align*} so in general $d_S(x g, y g) \leq (2|g| + 1) d_S(x, y)$ . However, this is estimate is in general sharp. Consider the case where $G$ is a free group of rank $\geq 2$ generated freely by $S$ . If $g \in G$ , then we can write $g = s_1 \cdots s_\ell$ for $s_1, \ldots, s_\ell \in S \cup S^{-1}$ , where the word is in reduced form so $|g| = \ell$ . Let $x$ be an element of $S \cup S^{-1}$ such that $x \not \in \left\{ s_1, s_1^{-1} \right\}$ . Then $g^{-1} x g = s_\ell^{-1} \cdots s_1^{-1} x s_1 \cdots s_\ell$ , and this is the reduced form, so $\left| g^{-1} x g \right| = 2|g| + 1$ . Thus $$d_S(g, xg) = 2|g| + 1 = (2|g| + 1) |x| = (2|g| + 1) d_S(e, x) .$$ So if $G$ is a nonabelian free group and $S$ is a free generator for $G$ , then for every $g \in G$ exists $x \in G$ such that $d_S(g, xg) = (2|g| + 1) d(e, x)$ , meaning that $2|g| + 1$ is the optimal Lipschitz constant for $x \mapsto g^{-1} x g$ . Assuming all the above is correct, I think there are at least two questions that are reasonable to ask: What groups admit right-invariant word metrics, or equivalently, which groups admit finite generators closed under conjugation? Clearly every finitely generated abelian group fits this bill, but I've yet to cook up an infinite non-abeliean example For which groups is every word metric right-invariant? Clearly every finitely generated abelian group fits this bill, but I've yet to cook up a non-abelian example, including the finite case.","Let be a finitely generated group with finite generator , and define the metric by i.e. is the word metric associated to . The metric will automatically be left-invariant, i.e. for all , since . However, this metric need not always be right-invariant. For an example of the word metric not being right-invariant, consider the example of , i.e. the free group on two generators, with (free) generator . Then , but , so the ""canonical"" word metric on the free group with two generators is not right-invariant. On the other hand, if is abelian, then every word metric is right-invariant. Right-invariance is equivalent to the conjugation action of on itself satisfying for all , since . So conjugation needs to preserve word length, and of course the conjugation action for an abelian group is trivial. Alternatively, if is finite, and , then is the discrete metric (i.e. ), and thus is also right-invariant. This trick works for any discrete group if we drop our assumption that be finite, but I'd rather consider the finite generator case. My question: is there a straightforward characterization of when the word metric is both left- and right-invariant? My guess would be that every word metric is right-invariant if and only if is abelian, but I can't prove this either. This seems like the kind of problem that should be elementary to solve, but alas, I haven't solved it. Alternatively, is there some sense in which the word metric will be ""almost right-invariant"", where we can place bounds on the extent to which the word metric fails to be right-invariant? Thanks in advance for your help! EDIT 1: Here's a partial answer based on @Mariano Suárez-Álvarez's suggestion, at the end of which are some related follow-up questions. Claim: Let be a finite generator for , and set . Let be the action of on itself by conjugation (note: this is a right action which I foolishly wrote on the left; thanks @Captain Lama for pointing this out). Then is right-invariant if and only if for all . Proof: The necessity is obvious, since if there existed for which , then we'd have . Now we claim it's sufficient. First, we remark that if is closed under conjugation by itself, then is closed under conjugation by all elements of , i.e. for all . This follows by writing an arbitrary element of as a product of elements of and applying an inductive argument. Moreover, we remark that if is closed under conjugation, then for all , where denotes word length. Let , where and . Then where . Thus conjugation cannot increase word length. We claim, however, that conjugation preserves word length, i.e. that for all . Assume for contradiction that there exist such that . Let . Then . This contradicts our earlier claim that for all . Thus if is closed under conjugation, then conjugation preserves word length. From here, it follows that if , then This concludes the proof. This criterion encompasses some non-abelian groups. For example, as we mentioned, every finite group can be realized in this way by taking . This proof can be elaborate on to show the word metric is ""almost right-invariant"" in the sense of ""Lie Groups and Error Analysis"" by Schiff and Shnider: Set For each , set . Consider , and let for , where . Then Applying an inductive argument, we can conclude that for all , so Edit 2: As @Sean Eberhard pointed out, this estimate can be cleaned up significantly to get so in general . However, this is estimate is in general sharp. Consider the case where is a free group of rank generated freely by . If , then we can write for , where the word is in reduced form so . Let be an element of such that . Then , and this is the reduced form, so .

92,Solving a riddle with group theory,Solving a riddle with group theory,,"In a videogame called ""Heroes of Hammerwatch"", there is an area in which players can try to solve a riddle to obtain loot. The riddle works like this: The area contains a 3 by 3 field of squares, some of them glowing and some of them not. Stepping on any square ""flips"" that square and its neighbors (meaning a glowing square changes to not-glowing and a not-glowing square changes to glowing) except for diagonal neighbors. Example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Stepping on square 1 would flip the squares 2, 4 and 1 itself. Stepping on square 5 would flip 2, 6, 8, 4 and 5 itself. You start with an arbitrary pattern (I think) and have to step on the squares in such a way as to make all of them glow. I felt like this problem lends itself to group theory. This is what I got so far: -stepping on each square is an element of the group -the group operation is composition, so just stepping on one square after the other -the neutral element is the act of not stepping on any square -the inverse of every element is the element itself, because you just flip all the same squares again -the group is abelian, because the only thing that matters is the amount of times a square gets ""flipped"", not the order From here, I figured that, starting from an ""empty"" board (no glowing squares), every state of the board is the product of either pressing a square or not. Example: 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 (1 = glowing, 0 = not glowing) This board is given by pressing square 1 and square 9, then pressing square 5 (the middle one), and not touching any other square.

97,Word problem in residually finite groups - enumerating normal subgroups,Word problem in residually finite groups - enumerating normal subgroups,,"I am trying to prove that the word problem is solvable for residually finite, finitely presented groups. It is known that one runs two algorithms in parallel. One algorithm stops when the word $w$ is trivial and the other when it is not. I am trying to reconstuct the second algorithm. Literature says that the algorithm works as follows: Enumerate all finite index normal subgroups $N$ / all homomorphism to finite groups $\phi:G\to Q$ ; For every normal subgroup, check whether $w$ lies in $N$ , or check whether $w$ becomes trivial under the homomorphism $\phi$ ; If $w$ does not lie in $N$ or $\phi(w)\neq 1$ then $w$ is not trivial in $G$ . (End the algorithm.) My question is as follows: How does one enumerate all the normal subgroups or all homomorphism to all finite groups? So far I succeeded in doing these things: I can algorithmically enumerate all subgroups of index $n$ as $\text{Stab}_G(1)$ for homomorphism $G\to S_n$ , where $G$ transitively on $\{1,2,\dots n\}$ . How does one decide whether the subgroup is normal in $G$ ? It would suffice to find generators of $\text{Stab}_G(1)$ , but how does one do so? Or is there another method? It is quite important for my work that the enumeration goes from small to larger indices.","I am trying to prove that the word problem is solvable for residually finite, finitely presented groups.

98,"In a group, when does $|ab| = \mathrm{lcm}(|a|, |b|)$","In a group, when does","|ab| = \mathrm{lcm}(|a|, |b|)","In a finite abelian group $G$ where $a$ has order $m$ and $b$ has order $n$ , I was able to prove that $\mathrm{lcm}(m,n) \mid |ab|$ by proving that $(ab)^{\mathrm{lcm}(m,n)} = e$ . I know that it is not true in general that $|ab| \mid \mathrm{lcm}(m,n)$ , but I'm trying to motivate a counterexample. My thought was that the following formula relating the lcm and gcd is useful: $$ \mathrm{lcm}(m,n) = \frac{mn}{\mathrm{gcd}(m,n)}. $$ If $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime, then $\mathrm{lcm}(m,n) = mn$ . That doesn't tell me anything necessarily about the order of $ab$ , however, unless it is true in general that if $\gcd(a,b) = 1$ , then $|ab| = |a||b|$ . In that case, we have $\mathrm{lcm}(m,n) = |ab| = mn$ if and only if $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime, and I should look for a counterexample where two elements have relatively prime order. I'd appreciate if someone could comment a bit more on this. I'm especially interested in how to motivate counterexamples. Though I'm able to follow those I read, I have trouble coming up with them on my own.","In a finite abelian group where has order and has order , I was able to prove that by proving that .
