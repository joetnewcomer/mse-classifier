The only solution to this equation is $E=\frac{1}{4}$ . Now I thought that for a non-homogeneous equation, where the term $d(n)$ does not depend on the underlying recursion has the form $d(n) = k\mu^n$ and $\mu$ is not a root of the homogeneous equation, the solution is given by $$a_n = \frac{k\mu^n}{\Phi(\mu)}$$ where $\Phi$ is the characteristic equation of the homogeneous one.

I rewrote the problem as the title of this post, i.e. how many solutions are there to $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 30$ such that $x_1 + x_2 \le 20$ (Alice and Eve together get no more than $20$ ) and $x_3 \ge 7$ (Lucky gets at least $7$ ). First, I ""eliminated"" the second restriction. Give Lucky $7$ balls and distribute the remaining $23$ . Thus, we have $$ x_1 + x_2 + (x_3 + 7) + x_4 = 30 \\ x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 23 $$ Then, since the other restriction left me with doubts, I counted the number of solutions to the equation above, which is $23+3 \choose 3$ , and tried counting the solutions that violate $x_1 + x_2 \le 20$ to subtract from $23+3 \choose 3$ . Let $k = x_1 + x_2 \le 20$ . The solutions that violate this are those where $k \ge 21$ . Hence $$ (k + 21) + x_3 + x_4 = 23 \\ k + x_3 + x_4 = 2 $$ which has $2+2 \choose 2$ solutions. Therefore, my solutions was ${23+3 \choose 3}-{2+2 \choose 2} = 2600 - 6 = 2594$ . However, the book provides the following solution: Suppose Alice and Eve together get $k$ balls. This can be done in $k + 1$ ways. That leaves $30 - k$ balls for the other $2$ persons, but Lucky must get at least $7$ of these. So, there are $30 - k - 7$ additional balls to distribute to Lucky and the fourth person. This can be done in $(30 - k - 7) + 1$ ways. Hence, our answer is $\sum_{k=0}^{20}(k+1)(24-k)$ .

54,Algorithm to find the chromatic number of a graph (its not greedy)!!,Algorithm to find the chromatic number of a graph (its not greedy)!!,,"I have thought of an algorithm to find the chromatic number of a graph but I don't know whether it's right or not. Could someone confirm this for me? So it works like this: Suppose we take the graph with $N$ vertices (say $v_1,v_2,v_3\dots v_n$ ). We denote a chromatic number by $x$ , which is initialised by $0$ for now and take an empty set $z=\{\}$ , which will contain all the nodes that we choose from the graph for finding the chromatic number. Now basically what we do is, we take the node with highest degree (say $v_m$ ) and add it to our set $z$ and increment $x$ by $1$ . Now we take the node adjacent to $v_m$ (say $v_l$ ) and compare it with the nodes present in our set $z$ , for checking its adjacencies. If we find any node non-adjacent to the selected node, we give them the same colour, and $x$ remains the same. But if we don't, then we add the element to our set and increment $x$ by $1$ . Now suppose we don't find any node, so now our set is $z=\{v_m,v_l\}$ and $x=2$ . please note that if we have multiple nodes connected to the node with the our currently selected node i.e the node of the maximum degree for now  then what we do is we compare their degrees(but not the actual ones)we calculate their degree only by making their connections with the nodes that already exist in our set.we don't take into account their connections with the nodes that are not n the set. if after comparison also the degree of the adjacent nodes are same , then what we randomly select any node. Now we take the next node by comparing the degree(degrees are calculated based on the method above) of all the adjacent nodes that are adjacent to our previously selected nodes and in them we select the nodes which have the highest degree or multiple nodes having same degree  we colour them according to the set based method stated above. We repeat the same process for the other nodes, but the thing to note here is whenever we find a node non-adjacent to given node in the set, we first traverse all the elements that are having the same colour to the element which is non-adjacent to the current element. if we can't go to any other node in the latter stages of this process then what we do is search for the next node with the highest degree among all the remaining nodes. For making a record of all the elements which are having the same colour, we are maintaining $z$ . For example, $\{\{v_r,v_m\},v_l\}$ where $v_r$ and $v_l$ have the same colour. Each time we don't find any node non-adjacent to our current node, we add it to our set and increment $x$ by $1$ . After traversing all the nodes, the number of elements in the set $z$ is the chromatic number of the graph. One thing to note here is whenever we find a node non-adjacent to the current node, we insert it in our set $z$ at the position of the non-adjacent node in the form of nested sets in the set $z$ . But firstly we store the current node in the beginning of the nested set, and push back all the nodes available in the nested set. So that next time we compare a node in the set, we first compare the most recent node to save time.

Is that correct? Also, can a First-Order Logic Statement have more than one domain of discourse? For Example, The Quantified Version of The statement: "" Every King has at least one Minister "", seems to have two domain of discourses: Set of all Kings and Set of all Ministers .

Let $G$ be a tree with $n$ vertices, and every vertex can have either degree $1$ or $d$ . Find the number of degree $1$ vertices in terms of $d$ and $n$ .  I've been working on this problem and I feel like I almost have the answer. I worked out that if $d=2$ , the graph will just be a line with vertices and $2$ leaves, so there will be $2$ vertices with $\deg(1)$ , no matter how many vertices there actually are. If $d=3$ , $n$ starts to matter. Using the fact that the sum of all the $\deg(v)$ of a graph is $2|E|$ and that in a tree $|E|=|V|-1$ I worked out that the sum of $\deg(v)=2n-1$ , and that this sum mod $d$ will be the amount of degree $1$ vertices.
