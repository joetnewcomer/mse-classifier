94,Isaacs Character Theory exercise 6.4,Isaacs Character Theory exercise 6.4,,"Studying character theory of finite groups using Martin Isaacs' book ""Character Theory of Finite Groups"", I came across the following problem (exercise 6.4): Let $G$ be a finite group and let $\mathscr{H}(G) = \{H \subset G \mid \exists \psi \in \operatorname{Irr}(H) \text{ such that } \psi{\uparrow}^G \in \operatorname{Irr}(G)\}$ . Consider $\mathbb{H}(G) = \bigcap \mathscr{H}(G)$ . Prove that, if $G$ is an $M$ -group (that is, if every irreducible character of $G$ is induced by a linear character of a subgroup), then $\mathbb{H}(G)$ is abelian. This is one of those problems where I don't really know how to proceed. I believe the easiest way to go about this is probably to show that every irreducible character of $\mathbb{H}(G)$ is linear. So let $\psi$ be one such character, and write $$\psi{\uparrow}^G = \sum_{i=1}^t a_i\chi_i$$ as a combination of irreducible constituents, where $a_i \in \mathbb{N}^*$ . Computing both sides at $1$ yields $[G: \mathbb{H}(G)]\psi(1) \leq [G: \mathbb{H}(G)] \sum_{i=1}^t a_i$ , where we used the fact that $G$ is an $M$ -group to express each $\chi_i$ as a character induced from a linear character of a subgroup, and used the fact that said subgroup contains $\mathbb{H}(G)$ . This means $\psi(1)$ is bounded by the number of irreducible constituents that appear in the decomposition of $\psi{\uparrow}^G$ . This is pretty much where I get stuck. I think Clifford's Theorem probably plays a role somewhere, but I couldn't extract any meaningful information using it... My main difficulty is that I know next to nothing about the characters of $\mathbb{H}(G)$ besides the property I proved above... Is this a good approach? If so, how do I continue?

The more general case of this question is to prove a group of order $pq$ must have an element of order $p$ and an element of order $q$ , where $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes. I have seen this question on this site with so many solutions. However, none of them works for me because, up to Chapter 10, Sylow Theorem, Cauchy Theorem, homomorphism, quotient group, and even normal subgroups have not been introduced yet. Hence, there should be an elementary proof for Question 10.21 of Dan Saracino's book, but I do not know whether this elementary proof can also work for the general case or not. I have a proof for the general case, but I know there is a problem with this proof that I will mention after the proof: My proof Suppose $G$ is our group such that $|G|=pq \ ;\ p>q$ . There are two possibilities: $G$ is cyclic. $G$ is not cyclic. In the first case, we can consider $G=\langle x\rangle $ , so $\langle x^p\rangle $ and $\langle x^q\rangle $ are subgroups of order $q$ and $p$ , respectively. In the second case, we have 3 possibilities: All elements have order $p$ . All elements have order $q$ . Some elements have order $p$ some others have order $q$ . Now, we are showing that the first and second possibilities in this case can not exist, and so only the third one is acceptable. If all elements are of order $p$ : There is an element $x$ with order $p$ . $G= \{e,x,x^2,\cdots,x^{p-1}, \cdots \}$ . Now, we only know p elements of this group. What about the other elements? So, we name another element $y$ such that $y \not\in \langle x\rangle $ . According to the assumption, the order of $y$ should be $p$ . So $G=\{e,x,x^2,\cdots,x^{p-1},y,y^2,\cdots,y^{p-1} \cdots \}$ . You should know that $\langle x\rangle \cap \langle y\rangle = \emptyset$ . We know that the group should contain the product of every two elements, and since $x^iy^j \ne x^ry^s$ for all $i \ne r $ or $ j \ne s$ , $G$ should contain at least $p^2$ elements.  This is a contradiction because $p^2 > pq$ . If all elements are of order $q$ : With a same argument, we can say $G=\{e,x,x^2,\cdots,x^{q-1},y,y^2,\cdots,y^{q-1} \cdots \}$ . Now, $G$ should contain $q^2$ elements which are the product of elements of $\langle x\rangle $ and $\langle y\rangle $ . These $q^2$ elements form a subgroup in $G$ . Indeed the subgroup is denoted by $\langle x,y\rangle $ (i.e. elements which are generated by $x$ and $y$ ). $|\langle x,y\rangle|=q^2$ , but, according to the lagrange theorem, since $q^2$ does not devide $pq$ , this is impossible to have such a subgroup, and we reach a contradiction. Hence, $G$ should contain both subgroups of order $p$ and $q$ . The problem with this proof is that, unless I know elements of $\langle x\rangle $ can commute with elements of $\langle y\rangle $ , I cannot say $|\langle x,y\rangle|=q^2$ . Now, can anyone say how I should deal with this problem? If not, can anyone give me an elementary proof for the general case without using Sylow Theorem, Cauchy Theorem, homomorphism, quotient group, and normal subgroups?
