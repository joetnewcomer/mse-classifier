In the first part of the proof you can read An element $g$ of $D_n$ is a rigid motion taking the $n$ -gon back to itself, and it must carry vertices to vertices (how are vertices unlike other points in terms of their distance relationships with all points on the polygon?) and $g$ must preserve adjacency of vertices. I think I understand why $g$ must preserve adjacency of vertices: if $A$ and $B$ are vertices, then $g(A)$ and $g(B)$ are vertices, and the distance of $g(A)$ from $g(B)$ equals the distance of $A$ from $B$ . Therefore, $g(A)$ and $g(B)$ are adjacent. Is this reasoning correct?

I am not sure whether this is the reason. Thank you for your suggestions.","I am reading about features of volume of hyperballs, where I see two theorems, Most of the volume of the d-dimensional ball of radius r is contained in an annulus of width $O(r/d)$ near the surface. Most of the volume of the upper hemisphere of the d-dimensional ball is below the plane $x_1 = c/(d-1)^{1/2}$ Namely, most of volume of hyperball is near the surface, and, most of volume of hyperball is near the equator. How can these two happen at the same time? I find it very hard to have an image that can boil these two together. Can someone explain why this isn't a contradiction? Currently my guess is you don't know what ""north pole"" you have for reference when you pick the equator, so the two theorems can be resolved in the way that most of volume is only in the proportion of annulus near the surface which overlaps the equator currently considered (by picking a point as north pole).

For instance, one could take any two points on the circle, build a right angle triangle and, by Thales's theorem, the hypotenuse of said triangle would also be the diameter of the circle. However, I would like to know if there are any simple methods of accurately measuring the diameter/radius of a sphere, without cutting it or altering it in any other way, and using a minimum number of tools and intermediate measurements (to reduce the final error). One method that comes immediately to mind is to pin down the sphere between two flat surfaces (blocks) and measure the separation between these blocks; but that method introduces many possible sources of measurement errors, and requires the use of additional equipment (the blocks themselves). tl;dr : Is there a simple way to determine the radius of a sphere without using anything else than a (bendy) ruler?",,"['geometry', 'spheres']"

(I also noticed that Lang went out of his way to define these for alternating forms only, and if I remember right, one of the three other authors did it for symmetric forms only, but I'm not sure at the moment. This may be beside the point.) When I first heard of these, I thought ""oh, there must be a model of synthetic hyperbolic geometry in there somewhere."" I thought this was a good guess because, after all, if you fix a point in the synthetic Euclidean plane and look at the transformations that fix it, it looks like the geometry of the regular dot product on $\Bbb R^2$, and the distance even matches the one extracted from the dot product. But now I'm not so sure the analogous hyperbolic picture is so direct. It's hard to see why the ""hyperbolic inner product plane"" defined above would be the same as what is going on around a fixed point in hyperbolic geometry. In fact, I have a friend trying to convince me that the two are unrelated. One of his reasons is ""in hyperbolic geometry, there aren't two distinguished null lines through points like there are in the inner product space."" Finally, it's totally unclear (to me) if there is any connection between the inner product and the distance in hyperbolic geometry. The fact that both orthogonal and symplectic geometries can have hyperbolic planes adds another layer of complexity that I don't know what to do with. I'm anticipating one of these types of answers: Of course there's a useful model of hyperbolic geometry in the hyperbolic plane. You just have to take this subset with these lines and here's how the inner product matches up to the distance like so... or Yeah, they're related, you just need to think of hyperbolic geometry and Minkowskian geometry this way... or No, they're not really directly related. You should just just think of the inner product version separately as Minkowskian geometry... Of course, I may not be anticipating the best answer possible: I hope to be surprised! :) Note : I am aware that you can take $\Bbb R^3$ with a metric signature $++-$ and view it projectively to make a model of the synthetic hyperbolic geometry complete with a distance function, but that is not the direction of this question.
