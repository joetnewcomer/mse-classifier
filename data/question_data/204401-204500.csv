1,A number is a perfect square if and only if it has odd number of positive divisors,A number is a perfect square if and only if it has odd number of positive divisors,,I believe I have the solution to this problem but post it anyway to get feedback and alternate solutions/angles for it. For all $n \in \mathrm {Z_+}$ prove $n$ is a perfect square if and only if $n$ has odd # of positive divisors. $\Rightarrow$ : If $n$ is a perfect square it must consist of 1+ prime factors each to an even power.  If $n$ consists of 1+ prime factors each to an even power it must have an odd # of positive divisors because each even power contributes itself plus $1$ (for the $0$ case) to the number of divisors for product $n$ . $\Leftarrow$ : If $n$ has an odd number of positive divisors it must consist of 1+ prime factors each to an even power.  If $n$ consists of 1+ prime factors each to an even power it must be a perfect square.

I understand that if $f(x)$ is $\mathcal O(g(x))$ it means that there exists some constant $C$ and some value $k$ (for $x$) where $C\cdot g(x)$ will be greater than $f(x)$.  However, I don't understand how to prove this. The book example gives the function $f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1$ is $\mathcal O(x^2)$.  My book states that ""we observe that we can readily estimate the size of $f(x)$ when $x > 1$ because $x < x^2$ and $1 < x^2$ when $x > 1$.  It follows that $0 \le x^2 + 2x + 1 \le x^2 + 2x^2 + x^2 = 4x^2$."" By that example, I see that the constant $C$ is $4$ and $k$ is $1$.

42,Deriving the asymptotic estimate (9.62) in Concrete Mathematics,Deriving the asymptotic estimate (9.62) in Concrete Mathematics,,"I was reading Chapter 9: Asymptotics in Graham, Knuth, Patashnik: Concrete Mathematics, and I got stuck while deriving the following asymptotic estimate on page 466: $$ \begin{equation}   g_n = \frac{e^{\pi^2/6}}{n^2} + O(\log n / n^3) \, ,   \quad \text{for } n > 1 \, . \tag{9.62} \end{equation} $$ The value $g_n$ is the coefficient of $z^n$ in the generating function $$ \begin{equation}   G(z) = \exp\left(\sum_{k \geq 1} \frac{z^k}{k^2}\right) \, . \tag{9.57} \end{equation} $$ To derive the estimate, one starts by differentiating $(9.57)$: $$   G'(z) = \sum_{n \geq 0} n g_n z^{n-1} = \left( \sum_{k \geq 1} \frac{z^{k-1}}{k} \right) G(z) \, . $$ Equating coefficients of $z^{n-1}$ on both sides leads to the following recurrence for $g_n$: $$ \begin{equation}   n g_n = \sum_{0 \leq k < n} \frac{g_k}{n-k} \, . \tag{9.58} \end{equation} $$ Next, one proceeds with the following bootstrapping trick. Start with a rough initial estimate $g_n = O(1)$, obtained by showing that $0 < g_n \leq 1$ for $n \geq 0$. Plug the initial estimate into the recurrence to get a better estimate $g_n = O(\log n / n)$. By repeatedly plugging new estimates back into the recurrence and massaging the recurrence when needed, one gets successively better estimates, leading up to the following one that is one step away from $(9.62)$ (note the differently placed exponent in the $O$ term): $$ \begin{equation}   g_n = \frac{e^{\pi^2/6}}{n^2} + O(\log n / n)^3 \, ,   \quad \text{for } n > 1 \, . \tag{9.61} \end{equation} $$ Another bootstrapping step is supposed to give $(9.62)$. However, I fail to carry out the calculation. Here are some of the attempts I made. Attempt 1 Let me denote the constant $e^{\pi^2 / 6}$ by $c$. When I plug $(9.61)$ directly into $(9.58)$, I get the following: $$ \begin{align}   n g_n = {} & \frac{1}{n} + \sum_{0 < k < n} \frac{c}{k^2 (n-k)} + \sum_{0 < k < n} \frac{O(\log n)^3}{k^3 (n-k)} \\   = {} & \frac{1}{n} + c \sum_{0 < k < n} \left( \frac{1}{n k^2} + \frac{1}{n^2 k} + \frac{1}{n^2(n-k)} \right) \\   & {} + O(\log n)^3 \sum_{0 < k < n} \left( \frac{1}{n k^3} + \frac{1}{n^2 k^2} + \frac{1}{n^3 k} + \frac{1}{n^3 (n-k)} \right) \\   = {} & \frac{1}{n} + c \left( \frac{1}{n} H^{(2)}_{n-1} + \frac{2}{n^2} H_{n-1} \right) + O(\log n)^3 \left( \frac{1}{n} H^{(3)}_{n-1} + \frac{1}{n^2} H^{(2)}_{n-1} + \frac{2}{n^3} H_{n-1} \right) \, . \end{align} $$ (In the last step, $H^{(i)}_{n-1}$ stands for generalized harmonic numbers, and $H_{n-1}=H^{(1)}_{n-1}$.) This seems to be worse than what I started with, since for example $$ \frac{1}{n} H^{(3)}_{n-1} O(\log n)^3 = O\left( \frac{(\log n)^3}{n} \right) \, , $$ so $O((\log n)^3 / n^2)$ appears in the final estimate for $g_n$. Attempt 2 Another attempt involves the trick of ""pulling out the largest part."" This trick is used in Concrete Mathematics to derive $(9.61)$. We can massage the recurrence $(9.58)$ to obtain the following: $$ \begin{align}   n g_n & = \sum_{0 \leq k < n} \frac{g_k}{n} + \sum_{0 \leq k < n} g_k \left( \frac{1}{n-k} - \frac{1}{n} \right) \\   & = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k \geq 0} g_k - \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k \geq n} g_k + \frac{1}{n} \sum_{0 \leq k < n} \frac{k g_k}{n-k} \, . \end{align} $$ The first sum is $G(1)=c$. For the second sum, I have $$ \begin{align}   \sum_{k \geq n} g_k   & = \sum_{k \geq n} \frac{c}{k^2} + O\left( \sum_{k \geq n} \frac{(\log k)^3}{k^3} \right) \\   & = c \left( \frac{\pi^2}{6} - H^{(2)}_{n-1} \right) + O\left( \frac{(\log n)^3}{n^2} \right) \, . \end{align} $$ It doesn't look like I'm going to end up with anything as nice as $(9.62)$, but at least the final asymptotic error is still within $O(\log n / n^3)$. However, things fail again when I analyze the third sum: $$ \begin{align}   \sum_{0 \leq k < n} \frac{k g_k}{n-k}   & = \sum_{0 < k < n} \frac{c}{k (n-k)} + \sum_{0 < k < n} \frac{O(\log n)^3}{k^2 (n-k)} \\   & = \frac{c}{n} \sum_{0 < k < n} \left( \frac{1}{k} + \frac{1}{n-k} \right) + O(\log n)^3 \left( \frac{1}{n} H^{(2)}_{n-1} + \frac{2}{n^2} H_{n-1} \right) \\   & = \frac{2c}{n} H_{n-1} + O(\log n)^3 \left( \frac{1}{n} H^{(2)}_{n-1} + \frac{2}{n^2} H_{n-1} \right) \, . \end{align} $$ Similarly as in Attempt 1, there is a term $$ \frac{1}{n} H^{(2)}_{n-1} O(\log n)^3 = O\left( \frac{(\log n)^3}{n} \right) \, , $$ leading to $O(\log n / n)^3$ in the final estimate for $g_n$. Attempt 3 After pulling out $1/n$ in Attempt 2, we see that the first sum gives us exactly the leading term in $(9.62)$, so that sum should stay as it is. The second and the third sum are problematic. Each on its own contributes too much, so I guess the trick is to somehow fuse them together. One idea is to try pulling out another $1/n$ from the third sum: $$ \sum_{0 \leq k < n} \frac{k g_k}{n - k} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{0 \leq k < n} k g_k + \frac{1}{n} \sum_{0 \leq k < n} \frac{k^2 g_k}{n-k} \, . $$ Now the sum $\sum_{0 \leq k < n} k^2 g_k / (n-k)$ is fine: with the same kind of analysis as in previous attempts we conclude it is $O((\log n)^4 / n)$, so with all the pulled-out parts it contributes $O(\log n / n)^4$ in the final estimate. What to do with $\sum_{0 \leq k < n} k g_k$? My idea was to decompose it as in Attempt 2: $$ \sum_{0 \leq k < n} k g_k = \sum_{k \geq 0} k g_k - \sum_{k \geq n} k g_k \, . $$ Unfortunately, this doesn't work, because now the first sum is $G'(1)$, and this doesn't converge.

51,Do Cantor's Theorem and the Schroder-Bernstein Theorem Contradict?,Do Cantor's Theorem and the Schroder-Bernstein Theorem Contradict?,,"I am confused as to how Cantor's Theorem and the Schroder-Bernstein Theorem interact. I think I understand the proofs for both theorems, and I agree with both of them. My problem is that I think you can use the Schroder-Bernstein Theorem to disprove Cantor's Theorem. I think I must be doing something wrong, but I can't figure out what. Can someone tell me where I am going wrong? Here's how I think I can prove that the set of all natural numbers has the same cardinality as its power set. Cantor's Theorem says that the power set of any set A has greater cardinality than A. Specifically, the set of all natural numbers, $\mathbb{N}$, is countably infinite, while its power set $P(\mathbb{N})$ is uncountably infinite. The Schroder-Bernstein Theorem says that, for two sets $A$ and $B$, if there exist one-to-one functions $f:A\mapsto B$ and $g:B \mapsto A$, then sets $A$ and $B$ have the same cardinality. I will try to use this to prove that the set of all natural numbers N has the same cardinality as its power set $P(\mathbb{N})$. I need to prove that there exist one-to-one functions $f:\mathbb{N}\mapsto P(\mathbb{N})$ and $g:P(\mathbb{N})\mapsto \mathbb{N} $ $f:\mathbb{N}\mapsto P(\mathbb{N})$ Define $f:\mathbb{N}\mapsto P(\mathbb{N})$, $n\mapsto f(n)=\{n\}$ For each output $f(n)$, there can only be one n corresponding to $f(n)$, so $f$ is a one-to-one function. $g:P(\mathbb{N})\mapsto \mathbb{N} $ Define $g:P(\mathbb{N})\mapsto \mathbb{N} $ as follows Each element of $P(\mathbb{N})$ is a subset of $\mathbb{N}$, as represented by $\{{a}_{1},{a}_{2},\dots ,{a}_{k}\}$ where ${a}_{1},{a}_{2},\dots ,{a}_{k}$ are elements of $\mathbb{N}$ For each element $s=\{{a}_{1},{a}_{2},\dots ,{a}_{k}\}$ of $P(\mathbb{N})$, the elements of $s=\{{a}_{1},{a}_{2},\dots ,{a}_{k}\}$ are ordered from lowest to highest, so that ${a}_{1}<{a}_{2}<\dots <{a}_{k}$. The order of a set does not matter, so this can be done without creating a new set. For each element $s=\{{a}_{1},{a}_{2},\dots ,{a}_{k}\}$ of  $P(\mathbb{N})$, $g(s)={{p}_{1}}^{{a}_{1}} *{{p}_{2}}^{{a}_{2}} * ... * {{p}_{k}}^{{a}_{k}}$, where ${p}_{1},{p}_{2},...,{p}_{k}$ are each the $k$th prime number. Ex. ${p}_{1}=2, {p}_{2}=3, {p}_{3}=5,\dots$ $P(\mathbb{N})$ contains the empty set, so $g(\emptyset)=0.$ The set of all prime numbers is countably infinite, so it has the same cardinality as the largest element of $P(\mathbb{N})$, which is $\mathbb{N}$. Each output $g(s)$ is the prime factorization of some number n. Each number n has a unique prime factorization, so there is only one s in  $P(\mathbb{N})$ whose $g(s)$ is the prime factorization of n. Since the elements of $s=\{{a}_{1},{a}_{2},\dots ,{a}_{k}\}$ are ordered from lowest to highest, ${a}_{1}$ is the only element of $s$ that can be $0$. Thus, ${p}_{1}=2$ is the only prime number that can have an exponent of 0 in the output. Thus, it is impossible for any set $s$ in  $P(\mathbb{N})$ to have the same output $g(s)$ as a set of different length in $P(\mathbb{N})$ . In other words, it is impossible to add or remove an element of s to create a new set ${s}_{2}$ so that $g(s)=g({s}_{2})$. Every element $s$ of  $P(\mathbb{N})$ has a unique output $g(s)$, so $g:P(\mathbb{N})\mapsto \mathbb{N} $ is a one-to-one function. So $f:\mathbb{N}\mapsto P(\mathbb{N})$ and $g:P(\mathbb{N})\mapsto \mathbb{N} $ are both one-to-one functions. So $\mathbb{N}$ and  $P(\mathbb{N})$ have the same cardinality.

57,Recurrence relation for number of bit strings of length n that contain two consecutive 1s,Recurrence relation for number of bit strings of length n that contain two consecutive 1s,,"I'm pulling my hair out over a review question for my final tomorrow. Find a recurrence relation (and its initial conditions) for the number of bit strings of length n that contain two consecutive 1s. Here is my thought process/work, could someone please help me figure out where I'm going wrong? Knowing that a bit string of length 0 or 1 cannot contain two consecutive bits of any kind, and that only one bit string of length 2 (the string 11) can contain two consecutive ones, I have the initial conditions a(0) = 0 , a(1) = 0 , and a(2) = 1 . I'm now trying to find a formula for the term a(n+2) . I know there are three ways for a bit string of length n + 2 to have two consecutive 1s: Condition X : Both n + 1 and n + 2 are 1. count(X) = 2^n because this still leaves n bits unaccounted for. Condition Y : Both n and n + 1 are 1. count(Y) = 2^n for the same reason. Condition Z : The first n bits contain 11 somewhere. count(Z) = 4 * a(n) because adding 2 bits to the a(n) condition quadruples the number of possible strings. Since these three conditions are not mutually exclusive, a(n+2) count(X) + count(Y) + count(Z) - (count(X $\cup$ Y) + count(X $\cap$ Z) + count(Y $\cap$ Z)) + count($X \cap Y \cap Z)$ or a(n+2) = 2^n + 2^n + 4 * a(n) - (2^(n-1) + a(n) + 2 * a(n-1)) + a(n-1) This successfully proves the initial condition a(2) = 1 and the next one - a(3) = 3 . But when I plug in 4, I get 9. Listing out the possible strings by hand and circling the ones that satisfy the condition gives only 8. What am I doing wrong?

77,Adapted Towers of Hanoi from Concrete Mathematics - number of arrangements,Adapted Towers of Hanoi from Concrete Mathematics - number of arrangements,,"I have a doubt concerning an exercise from Chapter 1 of ""Concrete Mathematics"". Actually, my doubt is in one exercise ( exercise 3 ), but, since it depends on the previous exercise (2), I'm including it here too, with the respective solution that I found. Yes, I know that I could simply check the answer in Appendix A, since ""Concrete Mathematics"" gives answers to practically every exercise. But here's why I don't want to do this: I don't know how far my own attempt is from the correct answer. So, I would like someone to check if my attempt makes sense and give hints if there is something wrong or incomplete. If I checked the official solution right away, and it was very far from what I did, I would possibly end up missing the opportunity to find the correct answer (and I would also be unsure on whether my own attempt is also valid). 2. Find the shortest sequence of moves that transfers a tower of n disks from the left peg A to the right peg B, if direct moves between A and B are disallowed. (Each move must be or to or from the middle peg. As usual, a larger disk must never appear above a smaller one.) Note: I have no doubt in this particular exercise, but I included it because the exercise in which I have doubt depends on this one. I'm including the full detailed solution just for the sake of showing my work. First, the simplest case: if there are 0 disks, we need $T_0 = 0$ moves. For  $T_n$, we need to move the largest disk to peg B. For this, first we have to move the upper $n - 1$ disks to peg B, which requires $T_{n-1}$ moves. Then, we move the largest disk to the middle peg (1 move). Then, we can move the $n - 1$ disks back into peg A ($T_{n-1}$ more moves). Then, we move the largest disk to peg B (one more move). Finally, we can move the $n-1$ disks to peg B ($T_{n-1}$ more moves). So, we get the following recurrence relation: $T_0=0$ $\\ T_n = 3T_{n-1}+2 \ \ \ \ \text{for } n\geq1$ So, we have that $T_0 = 0$, $T_1 = 3T_0 + 2 = 2$, $T_2 = 3T_1 + 2 = 8$, $T_3 = 3T_2 + 2 = 26$, etc. Working with these numerical examples, we can eventually see that $T_n = 3^n - 1$. This can be proven by induction; for the base case: $T_0 = 3^0 - 1 = 0$. For the inductive step, assume that it is true that $T_{k} = 3^k - 1$ for some k; given this, we want to show that $T_{k+1} = 3^{k+1} - 1$. This is true, because: $T_{k+1} = 3T_{k} + 2 = 3(3^{k} - 1) + 2 = 3^{k+1} - 3 + 2 = 3^{k+1} - 1$. 3. (This is the exercise that I want someone to verify.) Show that, in the process of transferring a tower under the restrictions of the preceding exercise, we will actually encounter every properly stacked arrangement of n disks on three pegs. I manually tested some basic cases ($n = 1$, $n = 2$) by using the recurrence relation of the previous exercise, and concluded that the steps necessary to move the n disks from peg A to peg B really generate all the arrangements, and every possible configuration of the n disks in the 3 pegs arises, including the initial configuration (that is, when all disks are on peg A). Now, I will try to explain why this recurrence relation gives all the arrangements of n disks. My explanation may not be very clear, and it may be confusing. First of all, the initial configuration (that is, all disks are on peg A) is one possible arrangement. Let's use the following reasoning: there are only two things: the largest disk is one thing and the top $n-1$ disks are another thing. Let's consider the top $n-1$ disks as one indivisible block (as if it were only one disk). Then, applying the recurrence relation, we can see that: 1) When the largest disk is on peg A, the top $n-1$ disks are moved successively from peg A to pegs M (middle peg) and then B. This will give all possible arrangements between the largest disk and the top $n-1$ disks (visualized as a block) where the largest disk is on peg A. 2) When the largest disk is on peg M, the top $n-1$ disks are moved from peg B to peg M, then to peg A. This will give all possible arrangements where the largest disk is on peg M. 3) When the largest disk is on peg B, the top $n-1$ disks are moved from peg A to peg M, then to peg B. This will give all possible arrangements where the largest disk is on peg B. Since this is a recursive function, the same argument above will apply recursively to the movements of the top $n-1$ disks; that is, the largest of the $n-1$ disks will be one thing and the top $n-2$ disks will be another thing. And so on, recursively. From here, we can conclude that all the possible arrangements will be obtained. To finish this answer, I will calculate the number of arrangements, in the following way: for each of the $n$ disks, in decreasing order of size (from the largest to the smallest), choose one of the 3 pegs and put the disk in the peg. So, for each disk, there are 3 choices of peg. Therefore, the number of arrangements is $3^n$. This makes sense, because the number of moves is $3^n-1$. The number of arrangements is one plus the number of moves, because it includes the initial configuration (where all disks are on peg A).","I have a doubt concerning an exercise from Chapter 1 of ""Concrete Mathematics"".

81,Counterfeit Coin Problem Variant - Two Counterfeits,Counterfeit Coin Problem Variant - Two Counterfeits,,"So there's a counterfeit coin variant that I stumbled across and I'm not sure exactly how to solve it. It goes as follows: You have eight coins, two of which are counterfeit. One of the two is slightly heavier than normal, the other is slightly lighter. The two counterfeit coins have the same combined weight as two normal coins. You have a balance. How many weighings are necessary to identify both the heavier and lighter coin? I can do it in five, but I strongly suspect you can do it in fewer. EDIT: Solution for five weighings: Label your coins 1 through 8. Weigh 1 against 2, 3 against 4, 5 against 6, 7 against 8. If we get three balanced scales and one imbalanced scale, we know which two coins are counterfeit. If we get two balanced scales and two imbalanced scales, assume without loss of generality that 1 was heavier than 2 and 3 was heavier than 4. From this we can deduce that either 1 is the heavy counterfeit and 4 is the light counterfeit, or 2 is the light counterfeit and 3 is the heavy counterfeit. Therefore, we weigh 1 against 4. If they are balanced, then 2 is the light counterfeit and 3 is the heavy counterfeit. Otherwise, 1 is heavy and 4 is light. EDIT: As mentioned by Mees de Vries below, 3 weighings with 3 possible outcomes each can only distinguish between 27 possible scenarios. We have 56 total possible configurations, and so 4 weighings must be optimal if it is possible.","So there's a counterfeit coin variant that I stumbled across and I'm not sure exactly how to solve it. It goes as follows: You have eight coins, two of which are counterfeit. One of the two is slightly heavier than normal, the other is slightly lighter. The two counterfeit coins have the same combined weight as two normal coins. You have a balance. How many weighings are necessary to identify both the heavier and lighter coin? I can do it in five, but I strongly suspect you can do it in fewer. EDIT: Solution for five weighings: Label your coins 1 through 8. Weigh 1 against 2, 3 against 4, 5 against 6, 7 against 8. If we get three balanced scales and one imbalanced scale, we know which two coins are counterfeit. If we get two balanced scales and two imbalanced scales, assume without loss of generality that 1 was heavier than 2 and 3 was heavier than 4. From this we can deduce that either 1 is the heavy counterfeit and 4 is the light counterfeit, or 2 is the light counterfeit and 3 is the heavy counterfeit. Therefore, we weigh 1 against 4. If they are balanced, then 2 is the light counterfeit and 3 is the heavy counterfeit. Otherwise, 1 is heavy and 4 is light.
