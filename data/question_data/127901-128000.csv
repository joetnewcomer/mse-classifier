54,A few questions regarding permutations,A few questions regarding permutations,,"I'm studying for a midterm for my online algebra course and am taking a practice exam. Unfortunately, the exam has no accompanying solutions so I was hoping to appeal to the kind folks here for validation/clarification about, specifically, a multi-part question regarding permutations. Part a Let $\sigma = (123)(45)(6789)$ and $\tau = (13)(578)(49) \in S_9$ . Compute the order of $\sigma$ . Here the order of a permutation that's comprised of disjoint cycles is the least common multiple of the orders of the cycles. Thus we have $$LCM(3,2,4) = \boxed{12}$$ Part b Is $\sigma$ even or odd Since $\sigma$ is a $12$ -cycle and $12$ is even that means $\sigma$ is $\boxed{\text{odd}}$ . Part c Compute the composition $\tau \sigma$ $\tau \sigma = \boxed{(12)(475968)}$ Part d Is the $2$ -cycle $(12)$ in the subgroup $H = \langle \sigma, \tau \rangle < S_9$ generated by $\sigma$ and $\tau$ ? For this I am a bit stuck. First I am slightly confused by the notation $\langle \sigma, \tau \rangle$ . I am used to seeing notation like $\langle g \rangle$ which simply means the cyclic subgroup generated by the element $g$ . So, in this case I'm assuming $\langle \sigma, \tau \rangle$ means ""the cyclic subgroup generated by the elements $\sigma$ and $\tau$ ""? What exactly does that look like. For instance, I know $\langle g \rangle = \{g^n \mid n \in \mathbb{Z} \} = G$ is the definition of the cyclic subgroup generated by the element $g$ but for $\langle \sigma, \tau \rangle$ would it be something like $\{(\sigma \tau)^n \mid n \in \mathbb{Z} \}$ or maybe $\{\sigma^n \tau^m \mid n,m \in \mathbb{Z} \}$ ? If this is true then wouldn't the question be trivial since if $(12) \in H$ then since $H$ is generated by $\sigma$ and $\tau$ then every element in the subgroup is generated by these $2$ elements as well? Or could it be the case that $(12)$ is only generated by only one of the $2$ elements?

Let $G$ be a finitely generated group with subexponential growth that admits a surjective homomorphism $\pi:G\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}$ .  Show that then the kernel of $\pi$ is also finitely generated. I am still missing the part where you use the fact that $G$ has subexponential growth. Take $T$ a finite generating set of $G$ and take $g\in G$ such that $\pi(g)= 1$ . For any $t\in T$ , if $\pi(t)=n$ , we can write $t=tg^{-n}\cdot g^n$ . Since $\pi(tg^{-n})=0$ , we can find finite $S\subset\operatorname{ker}\pi$ such that $S\cup \{g\}$ generates $G$ . Now take $x=t_1t_2\ldots t_k\in\operatorname{ker}\pi$ with $t_i\in T$ . This can be rewritten as $$x= {t_1g^{-n_1}}g^{n_1}{t_2g^{-n_2}}g^{-n_1}g^{n_1+n_2}{t_3g^{-n_3}}g^{-n_1-n_2}\cdots          g^{n_1+\cdots+n_{k-1}}{t_kg^{-n_k}}g^{-n_1-\cdots -n_{k-1}}{g^{n_1+\cdots+n_k}}$$ $$={t_1g^{-n_1}}\cdot g^{n_1}{t_2g^{-n_2}}g^{-n_1}\cdot g^{n_1+n_2}{t_3g^{-n_3}}g^{-n_1-n_2}\cdots          g^{n_1+\cdots+n_{k-1}}{t_kg^{-n_k}}g^{-n_1-\cdots -n_{k-1}}$$ Here, $n_i = \pi(t_i)$ and the final factor vanishes since $n_1+n_2+\cdots+n_k=0$ because $x\in\operatorname{ker}\pi$ . We have shown that every element in the kernel is generated by the set $\{g^nsg^{-n}\mid s\in S\}$ . Now Löh claims that this $n$ must be bounded and hence that the kernel is finitely generated. I feel like this is a consequence of the subexponential growth but I cannot make this rigorous. Subexponential growth means that for a generating set $T$ , the growth function does not quasi-dominate an exponential. The same question has been asked here , but it gives another proof method which is less direct.","I am trying to solve exercise 6.E.20 from the book of Clara Löh on Geometric Group Theory.

Since $K$ is nonempty, so is $S$ , and so to show that $S$ is a subgroup, all that remains is to show closure under the operation and closure under inverses. Thus, let $x, y \in S$ . Then $\phi(xy) = \phi(x)\phi(y) \in \overline{S}$ , which shows closure under the operation. Finally, $\phi(x^{-1}) = \phi(x)^{-1} \in \overline{S}$ , which shows closure under inverses.

78,No simple group of order 720,No simple group of order 720,,"In his Notes on Group Theory, 2019 edition ( http://pdvpmtasgaon.edu.in/uploads/dptmaths/AnotesofGroupTheoryByMarkReeder.pdf p. 83 and ff.) Mark Reeder gives a proof of the non-existence of simple groups of order 720. P. 83, before the proof, he says : ""In the former case, where $n_3(G) = 40$ , the normalizer of a Sylow3-subgroup P acts by an involution on P with trivial fixed points, and normalizes every subgroup of P."" A little lower, in the proof of Lemma 10.26, he says : ""If $n_{3}(G)  =  40$ then $N_{G}(P)$ contains an element inverting $P$ ,  hence normalizing $Q$ ."" If I understand it correctly, the reasoning is as follows : if $G$ is a simple group of order 720, if the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of $G$ is 40, then the normalizer $N_{G}(P)$ of a Sylow 3-subgroup $P$ of $G$ has order 18 and is not abelian. So far, so good (the normalizer is nonabelian in view of Burnside's normal complement theorem). M. Reeder seems to find it obvious that this implies that $N_{G}(P)$ is isomorphic either to the dihedral group of order 18 or to the generalized dihedral group constructed on a noncyclic group of order 9. But a nonabelian group $H$ of order 18 can also be isomorphic to the direct product of a group of order 3 with $S_{3}$ and in this case, it is not true that every element of order 2 of $H$ normalizes every subgroup of order 3 of $H$ . Thus, for me, the remark of Mark Reeder is not evident. Mark Reeder gives the following link to a proof by Derek Holt : http://sci.tech-archive.net/Archive/sci.math/2006-12/msg07456.html but this link no longer works. I can prove that $G$ has exactly 10 Sylow 3-subgroups and deduce from this that these  Sylow 3-subgroups have trivial pairwise intersections, but my proof is quite long, so, reading M. Reeder, I'm afraid that something is escaping me. Thus, my question is : can you explain the two sentences of M. Reeder that I quoted above ? Thanks in advance. By the way, I think that the non-existence of simple groups of order 720 can be proved in the following way. Let us define a colian group as a finite froup G with the following properties : 1° G is simple; 2° the order of G is divisible by 9 and not by 27; 3° the Sylow 3-subgroups of G are in number 10; 4° the Sylow  3-subgroups of G are noncyclic; 5°  the Sylow  3-subgroups of G interset pairwise trivially. The proof given by Cole of the isomorphy of all simple groups of order 360 (or, in any case the variant of this proof given here : https://fr.wikiversity.org/wiki/Th%C3%A9orie_des_groupes/ chapter 35) can easily be extended to the following statements : 1° every simple group of order 360 is colian; 2° every colian group is isomorphic to $A_{6}$ ; 3° (and thus  every simple group of order 360 is isomorphic to $A_{6}$ .) Then we prove that a simple group of order 720 should be colian, and thus should be isomorphic to $A_{6}$ , which is absurd since $A_{6}$ has order 360. Edit 1 (September 18, 2020). There is no problem with this part of Mark Reeder's proof. He proves (lemma 10.16) that if $P$ is an abelian Sylow subgroup of a nonabelian finite simple group $G$ , then no non-identity element of $P$ is centralized by $N_{G}(P)$ . Thus if $\vert P \vert = 9$ , $N_{G}(P)$ cannot be the direct product of a group of order $3$ with a group isomorphic to $S_{3}$ . Edit 2 (September 22, 2020). I think that the end of the proof of lemma 10.26 in M. Reeder's exposition (p. 83-84) can be simplified. The author assumes that $G$ is a simple group of order 720 and that $Q$ is a subgroup of order 3 of $G$ contained in several Sylow 3-subgroups of $G$ and he needs to draw a contradiction from it. He proves that $N_{G}(Q)$ has order 72, so $Q$ has exactly 10 conjugates in $G$ . Let $X$ denote the set of the conjugates of $Q$ in $G$ . Thus, $X$ has cardinality 10 and, as noted by the author, $G$ acts faithfully on $X$ by conjugation. The author proves that the $Q$ -orbits in $X$ have sizes 1, 3, 3, 3. Thus, if $t$ is an element of $Q \setminus \{1\}$ , (1) the permutation $M \mapsto tMt^{-1}$ of $X$ has only one fixed point. The author also notes that, by the $N/C$ theorem, $C_{G}(Q)$ has order 36 or 72. From here, I would say what follows. Just remember that $C_{G}(Q)$ has even order. That implies that $t$ is the square of an element of order 6. (Choose $a$ of order 2 in $C_{G}(Q)$ , then $t$ is the square of $t^{-1}a$ and $t^{-1}a$ has order 6.) Thus $t = u^{2}$ , with $u$ of order 6. In view of simplicity of $G$ , $u$ acts on $X$ by conjugation as an even permutation of order 6 and thus $t$ acts on $X$ by conjugation as the square of an even permutation of order 6. But an even permutation of order 6 of a set with cardinality 10 has cyclic structure 6-2-1-1, 3-3-2-2 or 3-2-2-1-1-1, thus the square of such a permutation has at least 4 fixed points, which contradicts the result (1) of the author, If I'm wrong, please say it me. Edit 3. (October 26, 2020) There is another problem, perhaps more serious, with M. Reeder's proof. See ( No simple group of order 720, again ). Edit 4. (March 26, 2023) @Derek Holt. Introducing your proof, you said : ""Let me know if it would helpful to include any further details anywhere, or if you can shorten any parts of the proof."" I think your proof is correct, but I can perhaps make some remarks. Here is my first remark. (I will continue if it seems to interest you.) 1° I think that in the proof of Jordan's proposition, it is not necessary to distinguish between the cases $|\Delta \cap g(\Delta)| = 1$ and the other case. Here is a proof without this distinction. It is long, but the reason is perhaps that I try to be exhaustive. For a finite set $\Omega$ and a subset $E$ of $\Omega$ , I will note $Alt_{\Omega}(E)$ the subgroup of $Alt({\Omega})$ formed by the even permutations of $\Omega$ that fix all elements of $\Omega \setminus E$ . $Alt_{\Omega}(E)$ is canonically isomorphic to $Alt(E)$ . (You note it $Alt(E)$ .) If $\Omega$ is a finite set and $G$ a subgroup of $Sym(\Omega)$ , I will say that a subset $E$ of $\Omega$ is richly permutated by $G$ if $Alt_{\Omega}(E)$ is contained in $G$ . The two following lemmas are easy to prove. Lemma 1. Let $\Omega$ be a finite set, $E$ a subset of $\Omega$ and $\sigma$ an element of $Sym(\Omega)$ . Then $Alt_{\Omega}(\sigma(E)) = \sigma Alt_{\Omega}(E) \sigma ^{-1}$ . Lemma 2. Let $\Omega$ be a finite set, $G$ a subgroup of $Sym(\Omega)$ , $E$ a subset of $\Omega$ richly permutated by $G$ . For every element $g$ of $G$ , $g(E)$ is also a subset of $\Omega$ richly permutated by $G$ . Theorem (Jordan). Let $\Omega$ be a finite set and $G$ a primitive subgroup of $Sym(\Omega )$ . If $G$ contains a $3$ -cycle, then $G$ contains $Alt(\Omega )$ (and is thus equal to $Alt(\Omega )$ or to $Sym(\Omega )$ ). Proof. By hypothesis, $G$ contains a $3$ -cycle $(x_{1} \ x_{2} \ x_{3})$ . Then the subset $\{x_{1}, \ x_{2}, \ x_{3})$ of $\Omega$ is richly permutated by $G$ , so there is at least a subset of $\Omega$ that is richly permutated by $G$ and that has cardinality at least $3$ (for example, $\{ x_{1}, \ x_{2}, \ x_{3} \}$ is such a subset). So, among the subsets of $\Omega$ that are richly permutated by $G$ and that have cardinality at least $3$ , we can choose one, say $\Delta$ , that is maximal for inclusion. We will prove that $\Delta$ is the whole $\Omega$ . Assume, by contradiction, that (hyp. 1) $\Delta$ is not the whole $\Omega$ . Then, since $| \Delta | > 1$ , $\Delta$ is not a trivial block for $G$ . Thus, since $G$ is primitive by hypothesis, $\Delta$ is not a block for $G$ . So, there is an element $g$ of $G$ such that we can choose $e_0 \in \Delta \cap g(\Delta )$ and $c_0 \in g(\Delta ) \setminus \Delta$ . For every distinct $a, b$ in $\Delta \setminus \{e_0 \}$ , $a, b$ and $e_0$ are three distinct elements of $\Delta$ , thus (since $\Delta$ is richly permutated by $G$ ) (2) $(a \ b \ e_0 ) \in G$ . On the other hand, $c_0 $ and $e_0 $ are two distinct elements of $g(\Delta )$ . Since $|\Delta| \geq 3$ , which implies $|g(\Delta )| \geq 3$ , we can choose an element $d_0 $ of $g(\Delta )$ that is distinct from $c_0 $ and $e_0 $ . Since (Lemma 2), $g(\Delta )$ is a subset of $\Omega$ richly permutated by $G$ , we have (3) $(c_0 \ d_0 \ e_0 ) \in G$ . From (2) and (3) results $(c_0 \ d_0 \ e_0)  \ (a \ b \ e_0 ) \ (c_0 \ d_0 \ e_0 )^{-1} \in G$ , i.e. (I compose permutations from right to left) (4) $(a \ b \ c_0 ) \in G$ , for every distinct $a$ and $b$ in $\Delta \setminus \{e_0 \}$ . We proved this for every distinct $a$ and $b$ in $\Delta \setminus \{e_0 \}$ . Let us prove that is true for every distinct $a$ and $b$ in $\Delta $ . We have to prove that (4) is still true if $a$ or $b$ is equal to $e_0 $ . In other words, we have to prove the two following theses : (thesis 5) for every $b$ distinct from $e_0$ in $\Delta $ , $( e_0 \ b \ c_0 ) \in G$ (thesis 6) for every $a$ distinct from $e_0$ in $\Delta $ , $( a \ e_0 \ c_0 ) \in G$ . Let $b$ be an element distinct from $e_0$ in $\Delta $ . Since $|g(\Delta )| \geq 3$ , we can choose an element $a_0$ distinct from $b$ in $\Delta \setminus \{ e_{0} \}$ . Then, by (2), (7) $(a_0 \ b \ e_0 ) \in G$ . On the other hand, we have, by (4), $(a_0 \ b \ c_0 ) \in G$ . With (7), this implies $(e_0 \ b \ a_0 ) (a_0 \ b \ c_0 ) \in G$ , i.e. (8) $( e_0 \ b \ c_0 ) \in G$ , which proves our thesis (5). Let now $a$ be an element distinct from $e_0$ in $\Delta $ . Since $|g(\Delta )| \geq 3$ , we can choose an element $b_0$ distinct from $a$ in $\Delta \setminus \{ e_{0} \}$ . Then by (2) et (4), $(a \ b_0 \ e_0) \ (c_0 \ b_0 \ a) \in G$ , i.e. (9) $(a \ c_0 \ e_0) \in G$ . which proves our thesis (6). From (4), (8) and (9), it results that for every distinct $a$ and $b$ in $\Delta $ , $(a \ b \ c_0 )$ is ìn $G$ . Since $\Delta $ is richly permutated by $G$ , it proves that every $3$ -cycle in $\Delta \cup \{ c_0 \}$ is in $G$ (more rigorously : the canonical image of every such cycle in $Sym(\Omega)$ is in $G$ ). Since every alternating group is generated by its $3$ -cycles, $\Delta \cup \{c_0 \}$ is thus richly permutated by $G$ , which contradicts the maximality of $\Delta $ . This contradiction shows that our hypothesis (1) is false, so $\Delta$ is the whole $\Omega$ , thus $\Omega$ is richly permutated by $G$ , which means that $G$ contains $Alt(\Omega)$ , which proves Jordan's proposition. By the way, a primitive group is by definition a transitive group with no non-trivial block. If I'm not wrong, the proof of Jordan's proposition doesn't depend on transitivity, only on the non-existence of non-trivial blocks. So, Jordan's proposition can be stated : ""Let $\Omega$ be a finite set and $G$ a subgroup of $Sym(\Omega )$ with no non-trivial block. If $G$ contains a $3$ -cycle, then $G$ contains $Alt(\Omega )$ (and is thus equal to $Alt(\Omega )$ or to $Sym(\Omega )$ )."" It is not really a strengthening of Jordan's proposition, in the sense that there is no case where the weak hypotheses are satisfied and the strong hypotheses are not, since the "" strengthening"" of Jordan's proposition shows that transitivity results from the weak hypotheses (since $Alt(\Omega)$ is transitive when $\Omega$ has at least $3$ elements).","In his Notes on Group Theory, 2019 edition ( http://pdvpmtasgaon.edu.in/uploads/dptmaths/AnotesofGroupTheoryByMarkReeder.pdf p. 83 and ff.)

In the meantime, I've been going back through some old homework to try and brush up on some of the theory. For this particular course, I no longer have my lecture notes, and there are no doubt gaps in my knowledge that have grown over the years.

Moreover, $\frac{\bar{Z}_{i+1}}{\bar{Z_i}} \cong \frac{Z_{i+2}}{Z_{i+1}} = Z(\frac{G}{Z_{i+1}}) \cong Z(\frac{\bar{G}}{\bar{Z_i}}).$ Hence $\frac{\bar{Z}_{i+1}}{\bar{Z}_i} \leq \frac{\bar{G}}{\bar{Z}_i}.$ Therefore, $1 = \bar{Z}_0 \triangleleft \bar{Z}_1 \triangleleft  ... \triangleleft \bar{Z}_c = \bar{G}$ is a central series of $\frac{G}{Z_1}.$ Since $\bar{Z}_{c-1} \neq \bar{G}$ , we deduce that this series is has length $c$ . Thus $\bar{G}$ is nilpotent of class $m \leq c.$ $\square$ Returning to the main problem, we proceed by induction on the nilpotence class of $G$ . If $G$ has class 1, then $Z(G) = G$ and the result holds. Suppose now that the result holds for all groups of class $c$ . Then if $G$ has class $c+1$ , we have shown that $\bar{G}$ has class $c$ . Now $Z(\bar{G}) = \frac{Z_2}{Z_1}$ . By Lemma 1, $Z_2$ is periodic, so that $Z(\bar{G})$ is periodic. By induction, $\bar{G}$ is periodic.

Previously, at the beginning of our course in one of our exercises we had to prove a (somewhat) similar theorem: Let $G$ be a group.

Suppose that $H$ acts on $N$ by automorphisms, and consider the semidirect product $G=H\ltimes N$ . I am busy classifying all irreducible representations of $G$ , as in Section 8.2 by Serre. Since $H$ acts on $N$ , $H$ also acts on the character group $\widehat{N}$ by $(h\cdot\chi)(n)=\chi(\phi_{h^{-1}}(n))$ . Let $(\chi_i)_{1\leq i\leq k}$ be representatives of the orbits of the $H$ -action. For each $i$ , let $H_i$ denote the stabilizer subgroup of $\chi_i$ and define $G_i=H_i\ltimes N$ as a normal subgroup of $G$ . The function $\chi_i^\circ:G_i\to\mathbb{C}$ given by $\chi_i^\circ(h,n)=\chi_i(n)$ is a linear representation of $G_i$ since $H_i$ stabilizes $\chi_i$ . Now, let $\rho$ be any irreudcible representation of $H_i$ , and define $\tilde{\rho}$ to be the irreducible representation of $G_i$ given by $\rho\circ pr_{H_i}$ , where $Pr_{H_i}$ is the natural projection on $H_i$ . Then define the representation $\theta_{i,\rho}$ of $G$ by $\theta_{i,\rho}=\text{Ind}_{G_i}^G(\tilde{\rho}\otimes\chi_i^\circ)$ . By Mackey's irreducibility criterion, each $\theta_{i,\rho}$ is irreducible.

To know that I have really classified all irreducible representations of $G$ , I need to prove that if $\theta_{i,\rho}\cong\theta_{i',\rho'}$ , then $i=i'$ and $\rho\cong\rho'$ . There is a proof of this in Serre (Proposition 25 $ii$ ), but I don't understand what is going on. Can anyone explain the proof in more detail? I also tried to come up with my own proof, but it seems to break down. I tried to use character theory. First, I followed Serre's argument to show that $i=i'$ . To show that $\rho$ and $\rho'$ are isomorphic, we show that their characters agree. Let $\chi_{\theta_{i,\rho}}$ and $\chi_{\theta_{i,\rho'}}$ denote the characters of $\theta_{i,\rho}$ and $\theta_{i,\rho'}$ . Since these are isomorphic, we know that $\chi_{\theta_{i,\rho}}=\chi_{\theta_{i,\rho'}}.$ Since $G_i$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ , we have that $$ \chi_{\theta_{i,\rho}}(h',n')=\frac{1}{|G_i|}\sum_{(h,n)\in G}\chi_i^\circ\big((h,n)^{-1}(h',n')(h,n)\big)\chi_{\tilde{\rho}}\big((h,n)^{-1}(h',n')(h,n)\big)=\frac{1}{|G_i|}\sum_{(h,n)\in G}\chi_i^\circ\big((h,n)^{-1}(h',n')(h,n)\big)\chi_{\rho}(hh'h^{-1})$$ and $$ \chi_{\theta_{i,\rho'}}(h',n')=\frac{1}{|G_i|}\sum_{(h,n)\in G}\chi_i^\circ\big((h,n)^{-1}(h',n')(h,n)\big)\chi_{\tilde{\rho}'}\big((h,n)^{-1}(h',n')(h,n)\big)=\frac{1}{|G_i|}\sum_{(h,n)\in G}\chi_i^\circ\big((h,n)^{-1}(h',n')(h,n)\big)\chi_{\rho'}(hh'h^{-1}) $$ I am stuck on what to do next, since I can't simply simplify $\chi_\rho(hh'h^{-1})=\chi_\rho(h')$ .

I will have to hold a seminar tomorrow and my professor helped me with one of my proofs. The proof is about showing that for any group $G$ and any abelian Subgroup $A$ the following statement is true: The degree of any irreducible representation of $G$ is less or equal to $\frac{g}{a}$ with $g$ being the order of $G$ and $a$ being the order of $A$ . I've already shown that any irreducible subrepresentation of an abelian group has degree $1$ . Later in my proof my professor wrote something along those lines: $ \dim(\rho*W) = \dim(W) $ for $\rho$ being a linear representation of $G$ in $V$ and $W$ being a subspace of $V$ and $W$ being the representation space of $A$ (abelian subgroup of $G$ ). He wrote something about $\rho$ being an isomorphism but as far as I know, linear representations usually are only (Group-)Homomorphisms but not necessarily Isomorphisms. So can anybody please explain to me why this statement is true in this general case, if it's even true at all? I would be very thankful if anybody could explain this to me. My main problem is that $\rho$ (referring to any element of $G$ ) is more or less a Matrix. Multiplying this matrix with $W$ (so every element in $W$ ) must not necessarily produce a vector space with the same dimension as the space $W$ . For example let's look at the matrix with $0$ in each entry. Multiplying this matrix with any vector in $W$ would give me only the vector space containing $0$ which is most certainly not $W$ . I'm sorry to bother you and I hope my problem isn't something completely obvious, I've been missing for hours now...","first time asking on here so sorry if it's a bit clumsy.

The proof is about showing that for any group and any abelian Subgroup the following statement is true: The degree of any irreducible representation of is less or equal to with being the order of and being the order of . I've already shown that any irreducible subrepresentation of an abelian group has degree .
