Edit2: For all who are interested, I want to give an answer to my own question, inspired by the comments below and some further thinking about the topic. To motivate the norms in Sobolev spaces: To make a Sobolev space a Banach space we need convergence of every Cauchy sequence to an element that also lies in $W^{k,p}$. We demand the elements of $W^{k,p}$ to have a weak derivative that lies in $L^p$ (actually multiple wead derivatives, depending on k). Assume we only used the $L^p$-norm to check for completeness, we would allow a sequence to converge to an element that only lies in $L^p$ but not in $W^{k,p}$. We would have a Cauchy sequence in $W^{k,p}$ that converges to an element in $L^p$ thus we would not have $W^{k,p}$ a Banach space (since it does not converge in the space). To avoid that we need a norm that only allows for sequences (to be Cauchy) that indeed converge to an element in $W^{k,p}$.  The original $W^{k,p}$-norm allows for that because we need not only our function $f_n \rightarrow f$ in $L^p$ but also the respective weak derivatives. This is only due to the norm. Short: The norm tells us, what we need to look at when checking for completeness. And only an appropriate norm covers all demanded requirements for the space. So if we use the wrong norm we converge to an element that does not fulfill the requirements and therefore does not lie in the requested Sobolev space. So far the question, what the term appropriate means, this may have been crystal clear to the pros, to me it was not, I felt confused by the seemingly arbitrary choice of norms. This leads to the second question: Why cannot the test functions be normed appropriately? Exactly for that reason: whatever norm I chose I cannot make a sequence in $C^\infty_0$ converge to an element of this very space.

It is easy to see that if $T(f)\geq 0$ for all $f\in X$, then $$\left|T(f)-T(g)\right|\leq T(f-g)$$ It follows from the triangle inequality that $\mathcal{M}$ satisfies the above condition and therefore is sublinear on $L^{1}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$. Moreover, the Hardy-Littlewood-Wiener theorem tells us that $\mathcal{M}:L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^{d})\rightarrow L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$ is a bounded, sublinear operator for $1<p<\infty$. $\mathcal{M}$ is in fact continuous on $L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$. Indeed, it follows from $\left|\mathcal{M}f-\mathcal{M}g\right|\leq\mathcal{M}(f-g)$ that $$\left\|\mathcal{M}f-\mathcal{M}g\right\|_{L^{p}}^{p}\leq\left\|\mathcal{M}(f-g)\right\|_{L^{p}}^{p}\leq C\left\|f-g\right\|_{L^{p}}^{p}$$ It is a well-known theorem of Kinnunen that $\mathcal{M}:W^{1,p}(\mathbb{R}^{d})\rightarrow W^{1,p}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$ is a bounded operator. In the paper [H. Luiro, ""Continuity of the Maximal Operator in Sobolev Spaces""], the author claims that $\mathcal{M}$ is not sublinear . Is this a misprint, or am I missing something nontrivial? I understand why the argument for the $L^{p}$ case doesn't carry over for Sobolev space, since we also have to deal with the weak gradient, and therefore continuity is nontrivial. However, I don't see why restricting the domain affects sublinearity.","Define the ( centered ) Hardy-Littlewood maximal function by $$\mathcal{M}f(x)=\sup_{r>0}\dfrac{1}{m(B(x,r))}\int_{B(x,r)}\left|f(y)\right|dy,\  f\in L_{\mathrm{loc}}^{1}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$$ We say that an operator $T:X\rightarrow Y$ between function spaces is sublinear if $$\left|T(\lambda f)\right|=\left|\lambda\right|\left|T(f)\right| \text{ and }\left|T(f+g)\right|\leq \left|T(f)\right|+\left|T(g)\right|$$ for all $f,g\in X$ and $\lambda\in\mathbb{C}$. It is easy to see that if $T(f)\geq 0$ for all $f\in X$, then $$\left|T(f)-T(g)\right|\leq T(f-g)$$ It follows from the triangle inequality that $\mathcal{M}$ satisfies the above condition and therefore is sublinear on $L^{1}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$. Moreover, the Hardy-Littlewood-Wiener theorem tells us that $\mathcal{M}:L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^{d})\rightarrow L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$ is a bounded, sublinear operator for $1<p<\infty$. $\mathcal{M}$ is in fact continuous on $L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$. Indeed, it follows from $\left|\mathcal{M}f-\mathcal{M}g\right|\leq\mathcal{M}(f-g)$ that $$\left\|\mathcal{M}f-\mathcal{M}g\right\|_{L^{p}}^{p}\leq\left\|\mathcal{M}(f-g)\right\|_{L^{p}}^{p}\leq C\left\|f-g\right\|_{L^{p}}^{p}$$ It is a well-known theorem of Kinnunen that $\mathcal{M}:W^{1,p}(\mathbb{R}^{d})\rightarrow W^{1,p}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$ is a bounded operator.
