My intuition tells me to start with: $\vec w = \begin{pmatrix}u(x,t)\\v(x,t)\\\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}\phi_1(x)h_1(t)\\\phi_2(x)h_2(t)\\\end{pmatrix} $ Differentiating with respect to x and t, I obtain: $\begin{pmatrix}\phi_1(x)h_1'(t)\\\phi_2(x)h_2'(t)\\\end{pmatrix} = A\begin{pmatrix}\phi_1(x)h_1(t)\\\phi_2(x)h_2(t)\\\end{pmatrix} + D\begin{pmatrix}\phi_1''(x)h_1(t)\\\phi_2''(x)h_2(t)\\\end{pmatrix} $ But at this point I get stuck, because expanding this seems to make the problem more difficult. Textbooks/papers in mathematical biology solve this problem, which is the linearized form of a reaction-diffusion model, by immediately assuming particular solutions of the form: $\vec w = \begin{pmatrix}u(x,t)\\v(x,t)\\\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}\alpha_1\\\alpha_2\\\end{pmatrix}cos(kx)e^{\lambda t} $, where k is the wavenumber and $\lambda $ is the eigenvalue. I find this really unsatisfying, because it seems to fall out of nowhere. My questions are: Is there a general method for separating variables in coupled linear PDEs or PDEs written in vector form? Is there a book/paper/tutorial that I can use to help me work this out in all of its details? Is there some deeper theory that I need to first understand?",,"['ordinary-differential-equations', 'partial-differential-equations', 'systems-of-equations']"

Furthermore, what characterizes a fundamental solution for a system.  It almost certainly should involve the $\delta$ distribution, no?  So if this is the case, why the $f$ and $g$?

I will use the following convention for the Fourier transform: $$\mathcal{F}(u(x,y))=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int\int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}}u(x,y)e^{-i(x\xi+y\zeta)}\;dxdy.$$  Then applying $\mathcal{F}$ to both equations we get \begin{array}{l} i\xi\hat{u}-i\zeta\hat{v}=\hat{f}\\ i\zeta\hat{u}+i\xi\hat{v}=\hat{g}. \end{array} If we solve for $\hat{u}$ and $\hat{v}$ we then get \begin{array}{l} \hat{u}=-\frac{i\xi\hat{f}+i\zeta\hat{g}}{\xi^{2}+\zeta^{2}}=-\frac{\hat{f_{x}}+\hat{g_{y}}}{\xi^{2}+\zeta^{2}}\\ \hat{v}=-\frac{i\zeta\hat{f}-i\xi\hat{g}}{\xi^{2}+\zeta^{2}}=-\frac{\hat{f_{y}}-\hat{g_{x}}}{\xi^{2}+\zeta^{2}}\end{array} so that by the convolution theorem \begin{array}{l} u=-\frac{1}{2\pi}(f_{x}+g_{y})*\mathcal{F}^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{\xi^{2}+\zeta^{2}}\right)\\ u=-\frac{1}{2\pi}(f_{y}-g_{x})*\mathcal{F}^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{\xi^{2}+\zeta^{2}}\right) \end{array} So then, formally speaking, if $$h=\frac{-1}{2\pi}\mathcal{F}^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{\xi^{2}+\zeta^{2}}\right),$$ then $$u=f_{x}*h+g_{y}*h$$ and $$v=f_{y}*h-g_{x}*h.$$ The fundamental solution is convolution with $f$ and $g$, however, not the partial derivatives of $f$ and $g$.  Also, the above solution can't be expressed with respect to convolution of a $2\times2$ matrix.  So, let us use the multipliers for the differentiation operators and immediately apply the convolution theorem.  To that end we have $$\begin{array}{l} \hat{u}=\frac{-i}{\xi^{2}+\zeta^{2}}\left(\xi\hat{f}+\zeta\hat{g}\right).\\ \hat{v}=\frac{-i}{\xi^{2}+\zeta^{2}}\left(\zeta\hat{f}-\xi\hat{g}\right). \end{array}$$ Then if $$A=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\mathcal{F}^{-1}\left(\frac{\xi}{\xi^{2}+\zeta^{2}}\right),$$ $$B=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\mathcal{F}^{-1}\left(\frac{\zeta}{\xi^{2}+\zeta^{2}}\right),$$ and $$M=\begin{pmatrix}A&B\\B&-A\end{pmatrix}$$ then $$\begin{pmatrix}u\\v\end{pmatrix}=M*\begin{pmatrix}f\\g\end{pmatrix}.$$ Would you think this is an acceptable answer?  Is it possible to explicitly invert $A$ and $B$?  The instructions ask for a $2\times2$ matrix of tempered distributions representing the fundamental solution. Clearly $M$ is the fundamental solution.  Presumably $f$ and $g$ are tempered so the operations used to solve for $u$ and $v$ are also tempered.  I still to this day just have difficulty accepting results obtained by formal operations on distributions as if they were functions as being true (or as being obtained rigorously I should say) since behind the scenes they are not functions (of course, I could probably just write everything as a linear functional to verify what I got already, but this seems dumb and unnecessary).","The question is to find a fundamental solution to the system of equations in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ \begin{array}{l} u_{x}-v_{y}=f\\ u_{y}+v_{x}=g\end{array} and to express the answer as a $2\times2$ matrix of tempered distributions.

I will use the following convention for the Fourier transform: $$\mathcal{F}(u(x,y))=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int\int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}}u(x,y)e^{-i(x\xi+y\zeta)}\;dxdy.$$  Then applying $\mathcal{F}$ to both equations we get \begin{array}{l} i\xi\hat{u}-i\zeta\hat{v}=\hat{f}\\ i\zeta\hat{u}+i\xi\hat{v}=\hat{g}. \end{array} If we solve for $\hat{u}$ and $\hat{v}$ we then get \begin{array}{l} \hat{u}=-\frac{i\xi\hat{f}+i\zeta\hat{g}}{\xi^{2}+\zeta^{2}}=-\frac{\hat{f_{x}}+\hat{g_{y}}}{\xi^{2}+\zeta^{2}}\\ \hat{v}=-\frac{i\zeta\hat{f}-i\xi\hat{g}}{\xi^{2}+\zeta^{2}}=-\frac{\hat{f_{y}}-\hat{g_{x}}}{\xi^{2}+\zeta^{2}}\end{array} so that by the convolution theorem \begin{array}{l} u=-\frac{1}{2\pi}(f_{x}+g_{y})*\mathcal{F}^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{\xi^{2}+\zeta^{2}}\right)\\ u=-\frac{1}{2\pi}(f_{y}-g_{x})*\mathcal{F}^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{\xi^{2}+\zeta^{2}}\right) \end{array} So then, formally speaking, if $$h=\frac{-1}{2\pi}\mathcal{F}^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{\xi^{2}+\zeta^{2}}\right),$$ then $$u=f_{x}*h+g_{y}*h$$ and $$v=f_{y}*h-g_{x}*h.$$ The fundamental solution is convolution with $f$ and $g$, however, not the partial derivatives of $f$ and $g$.  Also, the above solution can't be expressed with respect to convolution of a $2\times2$ matrix.  So, let us use the multipliers for the differentiation operators and immediately apply the convolution theorem.  To that end we have $$\begin{array}{l} \hat{u}=\frac{-i}{\xi^{2}+\zeta^{2}}\left(\xi\hat{f}+\zeta\hat{g}\right).\\ \hat{v}=\frac{-i}{\xi^{2}+\zeta^{2}}\left(\zeta\hat{f}-\xi\hat{g}\right). \end{array}$$ Then if $$A=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\mathcal{F}^{-1}\left(\frac{\xi}{\xi^{2}+\zeta^{2}}\right),$$ $$B=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\mathcal{F}^{-1}\left(\frac{\zeta}{\xi^{2}+\zeta^{2}}\right),$$ and $$M=\begin{pmatrix}A&B\\B&-A\end{pmatrix}$$ then $$\begin{pmatrix}u\\v\end{pmatrix}=M*\begin{pmatrix}f\\g\end{pmatrix}.$$ Would you think this is an acceptable answer?  Is it possible to explicitly invert $A$ and $B$?  The instructions ask for a $2\times2$ matrix of tempered distributions representing the fundamental solution. Clearly $M$ is the fundamental solution.  Presumably $f$ and $g$ are tempered so the operations used to solve for $u$ and $v$ are also tempered.  I still to this day just have difficulty accepting results obtained by formal operations on distributions as if they were functions as being true (or as being obtained rigorously I should say) since behind the scenes they are not functions (of course, I could probably just write everything as a linear functional to verify what I got already, but this seems dumb and unnecessary).",,"['analysis', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'partial-differential-equations', 'distribution-theory', 'systems-of-equations']"

90,Mass Spring Oscillator Interpretation,Mass Spring Oscillator Interpretation,,"I’m having some trouble predicting the behavior of ODE’s using the mass-spring analogy. For example, consider the second order IVP listed below:  $$y’’ – \space 6y’ + 8y = 0, \space \space \space \space y(0) = 2, \space \space y’(0) = -8$$ Now I believe that the initial condition of $y(0) = 2$ indicates that the original displacement of the spring from equilibrium is 2 units, but I could be wrong on that.  I have no idea what $y’(0) = -8$ means intuitively, so that’s the first thing I’m hoping to get cleared up (ie interpreting the initial conditions). Next, I understand that each coefficient means different things. From the equation above I see that there is an inertial mass of 1, a damping factor of -6, and a stiffness factor of +8. Since the damping factor is negative I think that the spring will not converge, but outside of that I’m not sure how to interpret the other coefficients. So as another question, how do you know when the solution will oscillate with increasing distance, or go off to positive/negative infinity, or simply oscillate, etc. I'm really seeking advice on interpreting what the behavior of the spring will be for all 8 different scenarios when the coefficients are positive and negative. I’m already planning to plug in some examples using wolfram alpha to see what’s going on, but getting some deeper understanding from the forum will definitely help. Any tips and help with this would be greatly appreciated. Edit: More specifically, I'm interested in how the solution behaves graphically over time.","I’m having some trouble predicting the behavior of ODE’s using the mass-spring analogy.
