My question is if the following formula is also true $$E (\sum_{i=0}^n(X_{i}-X)^2) =\sum_{i=0}^n(E( X_{i}-X)^2)$$ where by $X$ I mean the $X=(\sum_{i=0}^n X_{i})/n$. Of course $(X_{i}-X)^2$ isn't a linear equation so I don't know if that means anything. Can you please explain me if both formulas are true and why?,,"['probability', 'statistics']"
