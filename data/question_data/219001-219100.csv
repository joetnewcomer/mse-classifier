0,Trigonometry / Geometry Puzzle with a Circle Inscribed within a Square,Trigonometry / Geometry Puzzle with a Circle Inscribed within a Square,,Point $P$ is any point on the inscribed circle. You must prove that $$(\tan(a))^2 + (\tan(B))^2 = 8$$ I first moved point $P$ down to the point where the square would be tangent to the curve to make the problem easier. I realized that $(\tan(a))^2 = (\tan(b))^2 = 4$ in this simplified case. Next I separated $(\tan(a))^2$ into $$\frac{\sin(a)}{\cos(a)} \frac{\sin(a)}{\cos(a)} =4$$ and from there $$\frac{\sin(a)}{\cos(a)} =2$$ Then I used the law of sine to find that $$\frac{\sin(a)}{2^{1/2}\cdot AB} = \frac{\sin(A)}{1/2AB}$$ And that $\sin(a) = 2\cdot 2^{1/2}\cdot \sin(A)$ After that I was kind of lost on what to do.

1,I need to trace the edge of a hexagon point by point,I need to trace the edge of a hexagon point by point,,"To create an animation in code I first need to be able to describe a point by point path around a hexagonal shape. I already have the $\displaystyle \frac{x}{y}$ coordinate of each vertex. I don't know which direction I will be travelling around the edge so any solution should be able to work in either direction. The radius, and therefore each side, of the hexagon is 20 pixels. I need to produce a set of $20$ points for each side that maps the $x$ and $y$ position of each point in that path. This is obviously easy for straight lines where each point increments $1$ for each step and the other axis remains static. With the angled sides I am failing get the trigonometry required to plot the points. I'm fairly positive this is trivial but would appreciate some help getting clear in my mind.","To create an animation in code I first need to be able to describe a point by point path around a hexagonal shape.

14,Effect of angle and lever length on torque,Effect of angle and lever length on torque,,"First, some background on my problem: I'm a sailor, and I'm looking to attach a rope between the base of my boat's mast and the boom. We refer to this rope as a boom vang, and its purpose is to pull the boom down. Because the boom may swing from side to side, the rope is led to one end to the mast itself, in line with where the boom attached, and from there goes to the sailor. The question is, where on the boom should the other end of the boom vang be attached to maximize the downward torque? Here is a diagram (it's terrible - sorry), with the boom vang in solid blue: H is fixed. From the base of the mast, the rope leads off to the sailor, who can apply tension to it, some of which will become a downward force. The other variable is the distance from the mast to where the vang attaches to the boom, L. Theta is the angle between the rope and the deck (or the boom). It seems to me that the torque is the product of the downward force and the length of the lever that it's working on, L. Now, as L is increased, theta is decreased, reducing the downward force (compressing the boom instead). In the extreme cases, where theta is 90 degrees (parallel to the mast, thus maximum downward force, but no lever to act on), or infinitesimal (parallel to the infinitely long boom, providing a great long lever to act on but all of the force in the horizontal) there is no torque. So, how to choose the correct angle? If I remember correctly, the vertical component of the force should be sine(theta). Further, L should be cosine(theta). Since the torque is their product, the value for any theta should be sin(theta)*cos(theta). Is that correct? If so, the maximum should be theta = pi/4 radians, correct? Quick disclaimer: I haven't practiced this sort of math in nigh 20 years.","First, some background on my problem: I'm a sailor, and I'm looking to attach a rope between the base of my boat's mast and the boom.

I wish to provide a proof based on an example of the $\sin n\pi\theta$ case of the first result, I would appreciate if you could let me know if it is correct or what improvements could be made, I am somewhat doubt full about the last few steps of the irrational case. If $\theta$ is rational then let $\theta = \frac {p} {q}$ and let $n = aq + b$ then $$\phi(n) = \cos n \frac{p}{q} \pi = \cos(ap\pi + \frac{bp}{q} \pi) $$ Since $a\in Z+$ so $$\cos(ap\pi + \frac{bp}{q} \pi)  = (-1)^{ap}\cos(\frac{bp}{q} \pi)$$ Now if p is even as n increases from $0$ to $q-1$ then $\phi(n)$ takes the values  $$1, \cos\frac{p}{q} \pi, \cos\frac{2p}{q} \pi, \dots, \cos\frac{(q-1)p}{q} \pi$$ These values repeat as n goes from $q$ to $2q -1$ hence $\phi(n)$ is cyclic. Assuming if p is odd as n increases and is odd or even we get $np$ as odd or even determined by n and we observe cyclic values. Let $\theta$ be irrational and without loss of generality be a constant in $0<\theta&lt1$. Since $|\phi(n)| < 1$ either it periodically or tends to a limit. If $\cos n \theta \pi \rightarrow l$ so $$\cos (n+1) \theta \pi -\cos n\theta \pi = 2 \sin((n+\frac{1}{2})\theta\pi)\sin\frac{\theta\pi}{2} \rightarrow 0$$ Hence $$\sin((n+\frac{1}{2})\theta\pi) \rightarrow 0$$  then $$(n+\frac{1}{2})\theta = k_{n} + \frac{1}{2} + \epsilon_{n}$$ where $k_{n} \in Z$ and $\epsilon_{n}\rightarrow 0$. Hence $$\theta = k_{n} - k_{n-1} + \epsilon_{n} - \epsilon_{n-1} =l_{n}+\eta_{n}$$ where $l_{n} \in Z$ and $\eta_{n}\rightarrow 0$. This is impossible since $\theta$ is a constant and lies between $0 < \theta < 1 $. So we have reached a contradiction.

I am attempting to find the radius $r$ of a circle on which I know the horizontal position of two points (relative to the center), $x_1$ and $x_2$ , and the angle between them, $\alpha$ . I realize this certainly won't be possible in all cases, e.g. when $\alpha$ is zero or any multiple of $2\pi$ then there's a single point and no possible solution, but I'm not sure it's possible even if $\alpha$ is not these things. Put simply: I know $x_1$ , $x_2$ , and $\alpha$ . I need to find $r$ . Things I've tried so far: using the Cosine rule on the isosceles $\triangle{{x_1}{x_2}O}$ to produce an equation for the base ( ${x_1}\to{x_2}$ ) in terms of $r$ and $\alpha$ , but of course while I know $\alpha$ I don't know the length of the base because I've only got the horizontal coordinates. Combining that with right-angle triangles dropped from $O$ proved fruitless, but perhaps I'm missing something here? Some searching on this site turned up numerous problems involving two points and a circle, but the closest I could find to my particular situation was ""calculating the radius of a circle if the distance between two points and the angle from the center are known"" , but of course in this case I don't know the distance between these points, precisely. Context A couple of years ago, I was watching Matt Parker put a ludicrous number of RGB LEDs on his Christmas tree . Being in possession of a similarly ludicrous number of RGB LEDs, and a micro-controller needed to drive them (plus some small skill in coding on Raspberry Pis, and their cameras), I decided I should attempt something similar with ours. I got the micro-controller, and the LEDs, and even a nice web interface going. However, the calibration of the 3D positions of the LEDs on the tree proved too much to do in my spare time that year. This year, I'm revisiting the problem. I've got to the point of a nice chunk of code (with web interface) that'll capture an image of the base tree (unlit), and an image of each LED lit in turn, at a series of arbitrary angles (specified by the user), calculating the positions of each LED as seen by the camera by diff'ing each capture to the (unlit) base capture. Hence, in the diagram above, $O$ is looking down the trunk of the tree. I can estimate (pretty accurately) its location based on an average of the horizontal positions of all LEDs found in the captured images. $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the horizontal positions of a single LED captured at two different tree angles, and we know $\alpha$ because it's literally input from the user (""how far did you turn the tree?""). Calculating the radius $r$ will give me the distance of the LED from the trunk. We only have the horizontal positions because the diagram above is us looking at the tree down its trunk.

Alright, that's enough puns ...","Problem I'm not certain this is possible to solve (and indeed, if the answer is ""don't be silly, that's not possible"" then at the very least it'll save me some time!). I am attempting to find the radius of a circle on which I know the horizontal position of two points (relative to the center), and , and the angle between them, . I realize this certainly won't be possible in all cases, e.g. when is zero or any multiple of then there's a single point and no possible solution, but I'm not sure it's possible even if is not these things. Put simply: I know , , and . I need to find . Things I've tried so far: using the Cosine rule on the isosceles to produce an equation for the base ( ) in terms of and , but of course while I know I don't know the length of the base because I've only got the horizontal coordinates. Combining that with right-angle triangles dropped from proved fruitless, but perhaps I'm missing something here? Some searching on this site turned up numerous problems involving two points and a circle, but the closest I could find to my particular situation was ""calculating the radius of a circle if the distance between two points and the angle from the center are known"" , but of course in this case I don't know the distance between these points, precisely. Context A couple of years ago, I was watching Matt Parker put a ludicrous number of RGB LEDs on his Christmas tree . Being in possession of a similarly ludicrous number of RGB LEDs, and a micro-controller needed to drive them (plus some small skill in coding on Raspberry Pis, and their cameras), I decided I should attempt something similar with ours. I got the micro-controller, and the LEDs, and even a nice web interface going. However, the calibration of the 3D positions of the LEDs on the tree proved too much to do in my spare time that year. This year, I'm revisiting the problem. I've got to the point of a nice chunk of code (with web interface) that'll capture an image of the base tree (unlit), and an image of each LED lit in turn, at a series of arbitrary angles (specified by the user), calculating the positions of each LED as seen by the camera by diff'ing each capture to the (unlit) base capture. Hence, in the diagram above, is looking down the trunk of the tree. I can estimate (pretty accurately) its location based on an average of the horizontal positions of all LEDs found in the captured images. and are the horizontal positions of a single LED captured at two different tree angles, and we know because it's literally input from the user (""how far did you turn the tree?""). Calculating the radius will give me the distance of the LED from the trunk. We only have the horizontal positions because the diagram above is us looking at the tree down its trunk. The camera in this case is placed in ""front"" of the tree, hence why I've extended the dotted lines down below the diagram towards the ""camera"" (and yes, I realize they're not technically parallel in practice, but ""good enough"" is fine here!).

Improve this question Is there a vector algebra/calculus proof of the fact that $\cos^{2} A + \cos^{2} B + \cos^{2} C \geq \frac{3}{4}$ for any triangle $\Delta ABC$ ? I have seen many algebra/trig proofs, but I was wondering if there was a way to prove this using vectors, like the way you prove the law of cosines from expanding $(\vec{u} - \vec{v})^{2}$ ? This is my progress so far: A triangle can be specified by two vectors, $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ ; these form two sides of a triangle (the vertex being at the origin). Then, $\vec{v} - \vec{u}$ forms the other side. Let $u = |\vec{u}|$ and $v = |\vec{v}|$ , and $(\vec{v} - \vec{u})^{2} = (\vec{v} - \vec{u}) \cdot (\vec{v} - \vec{u}) = u^{2} + v^{2} - 2 \vec{u} \cdot \vec{v}$ . If $A$ denotes the angle between $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ at the origin, then $\cos^{2} A = \frac{(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})^{2}}{u^{2} v^{2}}$ . Likewise, if $B$ denotes the angle between $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v} - \vec{u}$ , then $\cos^{2} B = \frac{((\vec{v} - \vec{u}) \cdot u)^{2}}{(\vec{v} - \vec{u})^{2}u^{2}} = \frac{(\vec{v} \cdot \vec{u} - u^{2})^{2}}{(\vec{v} - \vec{u})^{2} u^{2}} = \frac{(\vec{v} \cdot \vec{u})^{2} - 2u^{2}(\vec{v}\cdot \vec{u})+u^{4}}{(\vec{v} - \vec{u})^{2}u^{2}}$ . If $C$ denotes the angle between $\vec{v} - \vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ , then $\cos^{2} C = \frac{((\vec{v} - \vec{u}) \cdot v)^{2}}{(\vec{v} - \vec{u})^{2}v^{2}} = \frac{(\vec{v} \cdot \vec{u} - v^{2})^{2}}{(\vec{v} - \vec{u})^{2} v^{2}} = \frac{(\vec{v} \cdot \vec{u})^{2} - 2v^{2}(\vec{v}\cdot \vec{u})+v^{4}}{(\vec{v} - \vec{u})^{2}v^{2}}$ . Using the common denominator of $(\vec{v} - \vec{u})^{2}u^{2}v^{2}$ , we then have the following: $$\cos^{2}A + \cos^{2} B + \cos^{2} C = \frac{(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})^{2}[(\vec{v} - \vec{u})^{2}+u^{2} + v^{2}] - 4(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})u^{2}v^{2} +u^{4}v^{2} + u^{2}v^{4}}{(\vec{v} - \vec{u})^{2}u^{2}v^{2}}$$ Simplifying the numerator gives: $$\cos^{2} A + \cos^{2} B + \cos^{2} C = \frac{u^{2}v^{2}(u^{2} + v^{2} - 4(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})) + 2(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})^{2}(u^{2} + v^{2} - \vec{u} \cdot \vec{v}) }{(\vec{v} - \vec{u})^{2}u^{2}v^{2}}$$ The statement that $\cos^{2} A + \cos^{2} B + \cos^{2} C \geq \frac{3}{4}$ then becomes equivalent to the statement that $$u^{2}v^{2}(u^{2}+v^{2} - 4(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})) + 2(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})(u^{2} + v^{2} - \vec{u} \cdot \vec{v}) \geq \frac{3}{4} (u^{2} + v^{2} - 2 \vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})u^{2}v^{2}$$ Subtracting the right-hand side from the left-hand side gives: $$\frac{1}{4}u^{2}v^{2}(u^{2} + v^{2} - 10(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})) + 2(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})(u^{2} + v^{2} - \vec{u} \cdot \vec{v}) \geq 0$$ One thought I had to prove this inequality was to rewrite the left-hand side as follows: $$\frac{1}{4}v^{2}(u^{2} - 2(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v}))^{2} + \frac{1}{4}u^{2}(v^{2} - 2(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v}))^{2} + (\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})^{2} - \frac{1}{2}(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})u^{2}v^{2} - (\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})^{3}$$ It would then suffice to show that $ (\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})^{2} - \frac{1}{2}(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})u^{2}v^{2} - (\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})^{3} \geq 0$ or equivalently that $(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v}) ((\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})-\frac{1}{2}u^{2}v^{2} -(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})^{2}) \geq 0$ . However, if $\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $u^{2} = v^{2} = 1$ (angle $A$ is $30^{\circ}$ ), then $(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v} - \frac{1}{2}u^{2}v^{2}-(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})) = \frac{1}{8}(6- 5\sqrt{3}) < 0$ . Is there another way to rewrite $$\frac{1}{4}u^{2}v^{2}(u^{2} + v^{2} - 10(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})) + 2(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})(u^{2} + v^{2} - \vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})$$ as a linear combination of $(u^{2} - 2\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})^{2}$ and $(v^{2} - 2\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})^{2}$ (with coefficients that are all nonnegative?) Note that the equality case should imply that $A = B = C = 60^{\circ}$ , which should be equivalent, in this context, to $u^{2} = 2 \vec{u} \cdot \vec{v}$ and $v^{2} = 2\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v}$ . $A = 60^{\circ} \iff u^{2}v^{2}=4(u \cdot v)^{2}$ ; $B = 60^{\circ} \iff (\vec{u} - \vec{v})^{2}u^{2} = 4(\vec{u} \cdot (\vec{v} - \vec{u}))^{2} \iff u^{4} + u^{2}v^{2} - 2(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})u^{2} = 4u^{4} + 4(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})^{2}- 8(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})u^{2} \iff 3u^{4}  - 6(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})u^{2}  = 0 \iff u^{2} = 2 u \cdot v$$ $C= 60^{\circ} \iff (\vec{u} - \vec{v})^{2}v^{2} = 4(\vec{u} \cdot (\vec{v} - \vec{u}))^{2} \iff v^{4} + u^{2}v^{2} - 2(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})v^{2} = 4v^{4} + 4(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})^{2}- 8(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})v^{2} \iff 3v^{4}  - 6(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})v^{2}  = 0 \iff v^{2} = 2 \vec{u} \cdot \vec{v}$ )","Closed.

Realistically, the player would not have any way to measure its distance to nearby stars, but it could measure angles between nearby stars. Problem You would need to use at least 3 nearby stars to identify the Player's location, but just any old 3 stars are not sufficient. Under certain conditions, the 3 angles between the Player and each of the 3 stars can represent 2 points. Visual showing 3 stars, the player position, and a degenerate point that has the same angles as the player Here the red circles are the 3 stars, the pink circle is the Player, and the Yellow circle is a degenerate point. The arcs show all of the points (with some error margin) that can be represented by just a single angle (ie. The green arcs show all the possible positions that have the same angle Star 2 - Player - Star 3 ). Keeping the same star positions, you can manipulate the player position to find an arangement that does not produce a degenerate point. Visual showing 3 stars and the player position, with the player position modified so that there is no degenerate point ( Here is the janky jsfiddle I made that generates these images. Re-run to randomize the star positions, click to move the player position to the mouse position.

Or perhaps more relevant to my problem: Given a set of nearby stars, how could I select 3 stars such that the angles produced resolve to exactly 1 point in space?","Context I'm making a 2D sci-fi game, and I've convinced myself that it would be neat to have player positions described in reference to nearby stars rather than using some kind of coordinate system.
