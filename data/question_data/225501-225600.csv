2,Some terminology involving homogeneous ideals in polynomial rings,Some terminology involving homogeneous ideals in polynomial rings,,"I was thinking about a problem that (as I only realized today) can be translated into the language of projective ideals in polynomial rings $-$ i.e. the stuff that defines projective varieties . I am now hoping to make use of the vast body of already existing knowledge on projective algebraic geometry, but I find it hard to find what I need because I don't speak this language very well. So I have a number of questions about what things are called. I hope someone can point me to the right terminology? Suppose $I \subset k[x_0, \ldots, x_N]$ is an ideal, generated by a finite set of homogeneous polynomials, where moreover all these homogeneous generators are homogeneous of the same degree $n$ . Does this number $n$ have a name? Intuitively I would expect it to be the degree of $I$ , but the geometric object $V(I)$ , consisting of the set of points in $\mathbb{P}^N$ on which all elements of $f$ are zero, apparently also has a degree which is defined in term of intersections with hyperplanes. It does not seem obvious to me that the two notions of degree are the same or even related. If they are not, what is my number $n$ called then? Let $I$ and $n$ be as above. Let $H^n$ be the ( $\binom{N + n -1}{n}$ -dimensional) vectorspace of all homogeneous degree $n$ polynomials. (Actually, if there is a more standard notation for $H^n$ I would also like to know.) What is the number $\dim (H^n \cap I)$ called? It is a dimension, but obviously it is not the dimension of the corresponding geometric object $V(I)$ . The space $H^n \cap I$ is what generates $I$ , by assumption. Keeping in mind Wikipedia's view of $I$ as being 'generated by a finite set of homogeneous polynomials' (rather than a vectorspace of homogeneous polynomials), we note that a set $S$ of homogeneous polynomials is a set generating $I$ which is minimal w.r.t. inclusion among all sets with that property, if and only if $S$ is a basis of $H^n \cap I$ . So from that perspective $\dim H^n \cap I$ is perhaps just called the number of generators of $I$ ? But the term 'number of generators' feels a bit ambiguous. It sounds like it depends on some chosen set of generators, that need moreover not be minimal w.r.t. inclusion. Maybe it is some special value of the Hilbert polynomial? The common set of zeros $V(I)$ of $I$ is apparently only called a variety if $I$ is a prime ideal, which, if I recall correctly, happens if and only if $V(I)$ is Zariski-closed. However, when $I$ is not prime, $V(I)$ is still a geometric object $-$ a well defined subset of $\mathbb{P}^N$ . So what is this geometric object called if it is not (necessarily) a variety? A 'shape'? A 'blob'? A 'bunch of points that together exhibit a remarkably smooth and rigid structure, as if they really try to be a variety but then fail at the last moment'? Common sense tells me $V(I)$ must have a Zariski-closure $\overline{V(I)}$ and that associated to that thing there is some ideal, which I now will call $\overline{I}$ by analogy, consisting of all polynomials that vanish on $\overline{V(I)}$ . The question is of course what is $\overline{I}$ called, and what is the standard notation for it. But now that I type this am also wondering what is the relation between $I$ and $\overline{I}$ is. On one hand being zero on a bigger set is a more restrictive condition and I expect $\overline{I} \subset I$ . On the other hand, making the innocuous sounding assumption that polynomials are continuous, we would have that every element of $I$ vanishes on all of $\overline{V(I)}$ and hence $I \subset \overline{I}$ . Together this implies $I = \overline{I}$ . But this would break the relation I thought I remembered between $V(I)$ being closed or not and $I$ being prime or not.

3,What is $\mathcal O(S\times \mathbb A^n_\mathbb Z)$?,What is ?,\mathcal O(S\times \mathbb A^n_\mathbb Z),"After many edits, here is my question: Is it true for a scheme $S$ that $\mathcal O(S\times \mathbb A_\mathbb Z^n) = \mathcal O(S)\otimes_\mathbb Z \mathcal O(\mathbb A^n)$ or not? Let $\mathbb A$ be the forgetful functor on the category of commutative rings. It is a ring object internal to the category of functors on $\text{cRing}$ . For each functor $X:\text{cRing}\to \text{Set}$ , let $\mathcal O(X) = \text{Hom}(X,\mathbb A)$ be the set of natural transformations form $X$ to $\mathbb A$ . Each $\mathcal O(X)$ get a ring structure from the internal ring structure of $\mathbb A$ . Is it true that $$\mathcal O(S\times \mathbb A^n) = \mathcal O(S)\otimes_\mathbb Z \mathbb Z[x_1,...,x_n] = \mathcal O(S)[x_1,...,x_n]$$ as commutative rings? I read lecture notes from Marc Nieper-Wißkirchen which claim this, but I am not able to compute it myself. I feel really stupid. There is an adjunction $\text{Hom}_{\text{Pr}(\text{cRing}^{op})}(X,yA) = \text{Hom}_{\text{cRing}}(A,\mathcal OX)$ , but it only implies that $\mathcal O$ sends colimits to limits. I know that the equation is true for representable $S$ . Do I need to write the functor $S$ as a colimit of representables? Edit. It seems like the result is not true for a general functor. We can pass to the smaller subcategories of sheaves in the Zariski topology and of (functorial) schemes. Colimits in the big Zariski topos Zar of sheaves in the Grothendieck topology are computed differently than in the presheaf category (sheafification). The ring $\mathcal O(S\times \mathbb A^n)$ does not depend on the surrounding category though. Does the equation $\mathcal O(S\times \mathbb A^n) = \mathcal O(S)[x_1,...,x_n]$ at least hold if $S$ is a scheme? Edit. Edit. Okay, now I am totally confused. Qiaochu Yuan claims below that $\mathcal O(S\times \mathbb A^n) \neq \mathcal O(S)[x_1,...,x_n]$ for general schemes, but I have the following argument. According to the stacks project the projection map $\mathbb A^n\times S\to S$ is up to isomorphism $\underline{Spec}_S(\mathcal O_S[T_1,...,T_n])\to S$ . The Spec thing here is the relative spec construction and it acts on a $\mathcal O_S$ -algebra! Let me denote the structure map by $$p:\underline{Spec}_S(\mathcal O_S[T_1,...,T_n])\to S$$ Now the relative Spec construction satisfies in general that $p_*\mathcal O_{\underline{Spec}_S\mathcal A} = \mathcal A$ for any $\mathcal O_S$ -algebra $\mathcal A$ . So I can compute the global functions on the scheme over $S$ as follows. \begin{align}\mathcal O(S\times \mathbb A^n) &= \mathcal O(\underline{Spec}_S(\mathcal O_S[T_1,...,T_n])) \\&= \mathcal O_{\underline{Spec}_S(\mathcal O_S[T_1,...,T_n])}(p^{-1}S)\\ &= p_*\underline{Spec}_S(\mathcal O_S[T_1,...,T_n])(S) \\&= \mathcal O_S[T_1,...,T_n](S)\\ &= \mathcal O(S)[x_1,...,x_n] \end{align} Here $\mathcal O_S$ is a sheaf of algebras and $\mathcal O(S)$ is a ring! What is wrong with my calculation? The step where I am not sure about is what the global sections of the sheaf $\mathcal O_S[T_1,...,T_n]$ are. Is the counterexample incorrect? (I must admit that I do not understand it completely). The original lecture notes can be found at the end of the article as a pdf, and the claim by M. Nieper-Wißkirchen is on page 58 equation (4.5.12) Also here is an argument which I believe does work for schemes which can be covered by finitely many open affines. Write $S$ as a colimit $S = \text{colim}_iU_i$ of finitely many open affine subfunctors. Make the following computation \begin{align} \mathcal O(\mathbb A^n\times S) &= \mathcal O(\mathbb A^n \times (\operatorname{colim}_{i}U_i))\\ &= \mathcal O(\operatorname{colim}_i(\mathbb A^n\times U_i)) \\ &= \operatorname{lim}_i\mathcal O(\mathbb A^n\times U_i) \\ &= \operatorname{lim}_i(\mathcal O\mathbb A^n \otimes_\mathbb Z \mathcal OU_i) \\ &= \mathcal O\mathbb A^n \otimes_\mathbb Z \operatorname{lim}_i\mathcal OU_i \\ &= \mathcal O\mathbb A^n\otimes_\mathbb Z\mathcal OS \end{align} where I now used that $-\otimes_\mathbb Z\mathcal O\mathbb A^n$ is exact and commutes with finite limits.","After many edits, here is my question: Is it true for a scheme that or not?

I feel like this is a general issue for arguments like this: they all either seem not entirely convincing to me, or rely on some software to compute a saturation of an ideal. Let $C$ be a curve of $\mathbb{P}^3$ over an algebraically closed field. Our goal is to compute the rational equivalence class of $\Gamma_C\subset\mathbb{G}(1,3)$ of lines meeting $C$ . Choose a plane $H$ intersecting $C$ transversely in points $p_1,\ldots,p_d$ , and a point $q$ not lying on $C$ . Choose coordinates $z_0,\ldots,z_3$ such that $q=(1:0:0:0)$ and $H=\{z_0=0\}$ . Consider the subgroup of $PGL_4$ consisting of the automorphisms with matrices $$A_t=\left( \begin{matrix}     1 & 0&0&0\\     0&t&0&0\\ 0&0&t&0\\ 0&0&0&t \end{matrix}\right),\ t\neq0.$$ To do this, we consider the closure $\overline{\Psi}$ of the locus $$\Psi=\{(t,L)\subset \mathbb{A}^1\times\mathbb{G}(1,3)\ |\ t\neq0,\ L\cap A_t(C)\neq\varnothing\}.$$ I would like to identify the fiber $\overline\Psi_0$ as the union of the Schubert cycles $\Sigma_1(\overline{p_i,q})$ of lines meeting the lines $\overline{p_i,q}$ with multiplicity 1 along each. The support of $\overline\Psi_0$ must be contained in the locus of lines meeting the flat limit $C_0=\lim_{t\to0} A_t(C)$ , which is supported on the union of lines $\overline{p_i,q}$ , and it certainly contains the lines $\overline{p_i,q}$ themselves, since they meet each of the $A_t(C)$ , so it is equal to the union of the Schubert cycles $\Sigma_1(\overline{p_i,q})$ . The above is basically the argument written for a different problem in the book, but I do not quite get it. How can I rigorously show that the support of $\overline\Psi_0$ must be contained in the locus of lines meeting the flat limit $C_0=\lim_{t\to0} A_t(C)$ ? It is certainly belieavable from a sort of 'continuity', but I have no idea how to prove something like this without digging into the ideals of the various subvarieties involved, which does not seem tractable by hand. The authors also write that the flat limit $C_0$ may have an embedded point at $q$ , but this does not happen for $\Psi_0$ , because it is a divisor in $\mathbb{G}(1,3)$ . Is it true that a flat limit of divisors is a divisor? I can see this from a Hilbert polynomial argument for divisors of $\mathbb{P}^n$ .

I guess it is 1, since we have stable lines in $H$ that meet $A_t(C)$ for each $t\neq 0$ only at one of the points $p_i$ and these lines are certainly not the limit of any other lines.

24,$\partial \bar \partial$-lemma for $d$-exact differential form.,-lemma for -exact differential form.,\partial \bar \partial d,"This is the $\partial \bar \partial$ -lemma as stated in [1]: Proposition 6.17 Let $X$ be a Kähler manifold, and let $\omega$ be a form which is both $\partial$ and $\bar \partial$ -closed. Then if $\omega$ is $d$ or $\partial$ or $\bar \partial$ -exact, there exists a form $\chi$ such that $\omega = \partial \bar \partial \chi$ . Voisin only proves the case where $\omega$ is $\bar \partial$ -exact, and I'm stuck with the case where $\omega$ is $d$ -exact. I tried to follow the proof of Voisin, but there is a term that won't disappear. Here is the idea: Since $\omega$ is $d$ -exact, we can write $\omega = d \beta$ for a form $\beta$ . By Hodge theory, there is a harmonic form $\alpha$ and a form $\gamma$ such that $$\beta = \alpha + \Delta_d \gamma,$$ where $\Delta_d$ is the $d$ -Laplacian. Since harmonic forms are $d$ -closed, this implies $$ \omega = d \Delta_d \gamma,$$ and since $X$ is Kähler we also have $\Delta_d = 2\Delta_{\bar\partial} = 2 (\bar \partial \bar \partial^* + \bar \partial^* \bar \partial)$ . Hence \begin{align*} \omega & = 2 (\partial + \bar \partial)(\bar \partial \bar \partial^* + \bar \partial^* \bar \partial)\gamma \\ & =  2 \partial \bar \partial \bar \partial^* \gamma + 2\partial \bar \partial^* \bar \partial \gamma + 2 \bar \partial \bar \partial^* \bar \partial\gamma. \end{align*} Since $\partial \bar \partial = - \bar \partial \partial$ , we see that everything except $2\partial \bar \partial^* \bar \partial \gamma$ is $\bar \partial$ -closed, hence $2\partial \bar \partial^* \bar \partial \gamma$ is also $\bar \partial$ -closed. But as $\partial \bar \partial^* = - \bar \partial^* \partial$ (which is true since $X$ is Kähler), we see that $2\partial \bar \partial^* \bar \partial \gamma$ is in the image of $\bar \partial^*$ , hence it vanishes (consider the scalar product with itself, and use the adjointness of $\bar \partial$ and $\bar \partial^*$ ). Thus $$ w = 2 \partial \bar \partial \bar \partial^* \gamma + 2 \bar \partial \bar \partial^* \bar \partial \gamma.$$ In the same way as above I can deduce that the second term $2\bar \partial \bar \partial^* \bar \partial \gamma$ is $\partial$ -closed, but I don't see why it should be zero.

28,The rank of the Jacobian of an algebraic curve,The rank of the Jacobian of an algebraic curve,,"Suppose $C \subset \mathbb{A}^n$ is an algebraic curve, with $C = V(I)$ where $I = \langle f_1,...,f_r\rangle\subset \mathbb{C}[x_1,...,x_n]$ is an ideal. Let $J$ be the Jacobian matrix where $J_{i,j} = \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j}$ . Why is it necessarily true that $\operatorname{Rank}(J) \leq n-1$ ? What I know: Since $C$ is an algebraic curve, I know that $I$ is generated by at least $(n-1)$ polynomials, so the maximum possible rank of $J$ is $n$ , which could potentially happen if $I$ is generated by $n$ polynomials and all of the rows of the Jacobian are linearly independent over $\mathbb{C}$ . Therefore, I imagine the goal is to show that this is actually impossible, say by contradicting the fact that $C$ is a curve. What I have tried: I know that one can change the generators of an ideal and will find that the rank of the Jacobian arising from each of these sets of generators will be the same at each point. So I hoped that one could try to find a Gröbner basis for $I$ which would only have $(n-1)$ generators, making the question trivial. However, I am not very familiar with Gröbner bases, I only know that in some sense they're ""the best you can do"" when it comes to finding generators for an ideal, so I have not been able to make much progress along this route. A second approach : As mentioned above, taking $I$ and $J_{i,j}$ as previously defined, the greatest possible rank of $J$ is $n$ , we want to show that this is in fact impossible. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that $\operatorname{rank}(J|_p) = n$ at some point $p$ , then there is some $n \times n$ submatrix of $J|_p$ which is of full rank, and is hence invertible. Therefore there is some sequence of row operations which transforms the matrix $J|_p$ into the form $$\begin{pmatrix}  I_{n\times n}\\ 0_{n \times (r-n)} \end{pmatrix}$$ From here I am unsure how to progress, but I'll present some logic here. The row operations performed on $J$ correspond to similar operations on the generators $f_1,..,f_r$ of $I$ . Being able to bring $J$ into the above form therefore corresponds to being able to map $f_1$ to some function $g_1$ where $\frac{\partial g_1}{\partial x_1}(p) = 1$ while $\frac{\partial g_1}{\partial x_i}(p) = 0$ for $i\neq 1$ and similarly for the other functions. I would like to be able to conclude from this that my new generators give an ideal which define a zero dimensional variety, but I am unsure how to progress from this point. My first intuition is that the restriction above meant that $g_1 = x_1$ , $g_2=x_2$ and so on, but there are numerous counter examples to this claim. Is there a suitable way to proceed from one of the methods outlined here, or am I making this more complicated than it needs to be?","Suppose is an algebraic curve, with where is an ideal.

A second approach : As mentioned above, taking and as previously defined, the greatest possible rank of is , we want to show that this is in fact impossible. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that at some point , then there is some submatrix of which is of full rank, and is hence invertible. Therefore there is some sequence of row operations which transforms the matrix into the form From here I am unsure how to progress, but I'll present some logic here. The row operations performed on correspond to similar operations on the generators of . Being able to bring into the above form therefore corresponds to being able to map to some function where while for and similarly for the other functions. I would like to be able to conclude from this that my new generators give an ideal which define a zero dimensional variety, but I am unsure how to progress from this point. My first intuition is that the restriction above meant that , and so on, but there are numerous counter examples to this claim. Is there a suitable way to proceed from one of the methods outlined here, or am I making this more complicated than it needs to be?","C \subset \mathbb{A}^n C = V(I) I = \langle f_1,...,f_r\rangle\subset \mathbb{C}[x_1,...,x_n] J J_{i,j} = \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j} \operatorname{Rank}(J) \leq n-1 C I (n-1) J n I n \mathbb{C} C I (n-1) I J_{i,j} J n \operatorname{rank}(J|_p) = n p n \times n J|_p J|_p \begin{pmatrix}

A variety over a field $k$ is normally defined as a reduced, irreducible and separated scheme of finite type over $k$ . First, I speak about irreducibility (this is from A functorial definition of a projective curve ). We define an affine space $\Bbb A^n_k$ as $k$ -scheme $\Bbb A^n_k$ such that $\Bbb A^n_k(R)=R^n$ (as in this paper from the arXiv ). We consider the coproduct of two of $\Bbb A^n_k$ (in the functor category), that is $\Bbb A^n_k \sqcup \Bbb A^n_k$ (i.e. disjoin union). A $k$ -scheme $X$ is said to be connected if there doesn't exists an epimorphism $X \rightarrow \Bbb A^n_k \sqcup \Bbb A^n_k$ , and then a scheme $X$ is said to irreducible if for every closed immersion (i.e. proper monomorphism by the valuative criterion for properness) $Z \rightarrow X$ we have $X\setminus Z$ is connected.

Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field with char $(k)\neq2$ and let $Q(x,y)$ be an irreducible polynomial of degree 2 in $k[x,y].$ We write $Q(x,y)=ax^2+bxy+cy^2+dx+ey+f$ for some $a,\ldots,f \in k.$ Since $k$ is algebraically closed, we have $$Q(x,y)=L_1L_2+L_3+f$$ where $L_3=dx+ef$ and $L_1,L_2$ are linear forms in $k[x,y]$ such that $L_1L_2=ax^2+bxy+cy^2.$ We split into two cases: (1) $L_1\sim L_2$ and  (2) $L_1\not\sim L_2.$ (1) If $L_1\sim L_2,$ then $L_2=\lambda L_1$ for some $\lambda \in k^\times$ and we have $Q(x,y)=\lambda L_1^2 + L_3 + f.$ Since $k$ is algebraically closed and $Q(x,y)$ is irreducible in $k[x,y],$ it follows that $L_1\not\sim L_3.$ Therefore $(u,v)=(\sqrt{-\lambda}L_1,\,L_3+f)$ is an affine change of coordinates such that $$Q(x,y)=v-u^2.$$ (2) If $L_1\not\sim L_2,$ then there exist $\lambda,\mu \in k$ such that $L_3=\lambda L_1+\mu L_2.$ As such, we have $Q(x,y)=(L_1+\mu)(L_2+\lambda)-(\lambda\mu-f).$ Since $Q(x,y)$ is irreducible in $k[x,y],$ it follows that $\lambda\mu-f\neq 0.$ Therefore $(u,v)=\left(\dfrac{L_1+\mu}{\sqrt{\lambda\mu-f}}\,,\dfrac{L_2+\lambda}{\sqrt{\lambda\mu-f}}\right)$ is an affine change of coordinates such that $$Q(x,y)\sim uv-1.$$ If $L_1=\alpha x+ \beta y$ and $L_2=\gamma x + \delta y,$ then $L_1\sim L_2$ if and only if $\alpha\delta-\beta\gamma=0.$ Moreover, since $L_1L_2=ax^2+bxy+cy^2,$ we have $$(\alpha\delta-\beta\gamma)^2=(\alpha\delta+\beta\gamma)^2-4(\alpha\gamma)(\beta\delta)=b^2-4ac.$$ It thus follows that $$k[x,y]/(Q(x,y))\cong \left\{\begin{array}{ll} k[t] & \text{if } b^2=4ac,\\ k[t,t^{-1}] & \text{if } b^2\neq 4ac. \end{array}\right.$$","The following argument classifies affine conics over an algebraically closed field with char But I don't see where it uses the hypothesis that char Is it an unnecessary hypothesis?

66,Algebraic varieties : How to calculate explicitly the ramification index?,Algebraic varieties : How to calculate explicitly the ramification index?,,"Again a question about algebraic varieties ! Actually, I followed to book of Silverman ""The Arithmetic of elliptic curve"", and I have several questions about ramification index. For $\phi : C_1 \to C_2$ a non constant map of smooth curves, and $P \in C_1$ , he's defining the ramification index of $\phi$ at $P$ as : $e_{\phi}(P) = \operatorname{ord}_{P}(\phi^*(t_{\phi(P)}))$ where $t_{\phi(P)}$ is a uniformizer at $\phi(P)$ . Then, we have a proposition among which we have the formula : $\forall Q \in C_2 \; \operatorname{deg}(\phi) = \sum_{P \in \phi^{-1}(Q)} e_{\phi}(P)$ . My problem is : how to explicitly calculate $\operatorname{deg}(\phi)$ using this formula. I mean, the author gives then an example : $\phi : \mathbb{P}^1 \to \mathbb{P}^1 \; [X:Y] \mapsto [X^3(X-Y)^2:Y^5]$ , and he says that $\phi$ is unramified everywhere except on $[0:1]$ and $[1:1]$ where we find : $e_{\phi}([0:1]) = 3, e_{\phi}([1:1]) = 2$ . So, I tried to understand this example, but I'm stuck. Actually, I didn't first saw why it is unramified everywhere except on $[0:1]$ and $[1:1]$ , so I tried to understand what happens in $[0:1]$ and $[1:1]$ for example. If $Q=[a:b], \; b \neq 0$ , we have : $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1, Q}= k[\frac{X}{Y}]_{(\frac{X}{Y}-\frac{a}{b})}$ with maximal ideal : $\mathcal{m}_q = (\frac{X}{Y}-\frac{a}{b})k[\frac{X}{Y}]_{(\frac{X}{Y}-\frac{a}{b})}$ . So, for $Q=[0:1]$ for instance, we have : $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1, Q}= k[\frac{X}{Y}]_{(\frac{X}{Y})}$ with maximal ideal : $(\frac{X}{Y})k[\frac{X}{Y}]_{(\frac{X}{Y})}$ , and a uniformizer is then given by $\frac{X}{Y}$ . But we have : $$ e_{\phi}([0:1]) = \operatorname{ord}_{[0:1]}(\frac{X}{Y} \circ [X^3(X-Y)^2 : Y^5]) = \operatorname{ord}_{[0:1]}(\frac{X^3}{Y^3}(X-Y)^2.\frac{1}{Y^2}) $$ which is not in the maximal ideal, but : $$ (\frac{X^3}{Y^5}(X-Y)^2)^2 = \frac{X^6}{Y^6}.\frac{(X-Y)^4}{Y^4} $$ seems to be on the ideal cause it's a quotient of polynomial of same degree of the form : $\frac{X}{Y} \times (*)$ . So, we find : $e_{\phi}([0:1]) = 2$ ? So, obviously I'm wrong somewhere, or there is something I didn't understood. And it's the same for the other one. So my first question is : where I'm wrong, and how to explictly determine the ramification index ? My second question is : if we know that $\phi : C_1 \to C_2$ is given by $[x:y] \mapsto [f_1(x) : 1]$ for example, and we know in some point $P$ $f_1$ as a pole of order $n$ fixed, and otherwise $f_1$ as neither a pole nor a zero. Can we conclude that : $deg(\phi)= - \operatorname{ord}_P(f_1)) = n$ and the same if we replace the pole by a zero ? Put an other way : is there a link between the pole and zeros of the rational functions defining the map and the degree of the map ?

Let $V_{0}\subset \mathbb{P}^m$ be the open subset of $\mathbb{P}^m$ corresponding to the subset $y_{0}\neq 0$ .

Now since $\phi$ is a morphism it follows that for $f:\phi^{-1}(V_{0}\cap Y)\rightarrow k$ a regular function that $f\circ \phi$ is regular. This doesn't give me a lot to work with.

78,Definable homeomorphisms in o-minimal geometry,Definable homeomorphisms in o-minimal geometry,,"I am currently working through the proof of the so called ""triangulation theorem"" on page 130 in Lou van den Dries book ""Tame Topology and o-minimal Structures."". Triangulation Theorem: Let $S\subset R^m$ be a definable set, with definable subsets $S_1,...,S_k$ . Then $S$ has a triangulation in $R^m$ that is compatible with these subsets. I got ruminative at the following passage: ""Therefore we modify $F$ as follows to $\tilde{F}$ . Each $f\in F$ extends, first continuously to the   closure of its domain, and then, by the last remark of (2.3), further to a continuous definable function $\tilde{f}:A\rightarrow R$ ."" I went on and looked up the remark (2.3), which, in my opinion, demands the $\Phi$ function in the definition of a triangulation to be continuous in both directions (i.e. a topological homeomorphism), in order to fullfill. The full ""remark"" (2.3) in vdD book is: (2.3) Definition. Let $A\subset R^m$ be a definable set. A triangulation in $R^n$ of $A$ is a pair $(\Phi,K)$ consisting of a complex $K$ in $R^n$ and a definable homeomorphism $\Phi:A\rightarrow \mid K \mid$ . Note that then $\Phi^{-1}(K):=\left\{ \Phi^{-1}(\sigma): \sigma\in K\right\}$ is a finite partition of A. We call $(A,\Phi^{-1}(K))$ a triangulated set. The triangulation is said to be compatible with the subset $A'\subset A$ if $A'$ is a union of elements of $\Phi^{-1}(K)$ . Note that by Chapter 6.(1.10), we have: A is closed and bounded $\iff$ the complex K is closed (where $A\subset R^m$ is a definable set). In that case each continuous definable R-valued function on $cl(C)$ , where $C\in\Phi^{-1}(K)$ , has a continuous definable R-valued extension to A, by lemma (2.2). Where chapter 6, (1.10) says: (1.10) Proposition. If $f:X\rightarrow R^n$ is a continuous definable map on a closed bounded set $X\subset R^m$ , then $f(X)$ is closed and bounded in $R^n$ . and lemma (2.2) says (2.2) Lemma. Let $K$ be a closed complex in $R^m$ and $L$ a closed subcomplex. Then each continuous definable function $f:\mid L \mid \rightarrow R$ has a continuous definable extension $\tilde{f}:\mid K \mid \rightarrow R$ . So, in order to apply lemma (2.2) we need a closed simplicial complex $K$ , which follows from the continuity of $\Phi$ (here we need the continuity) and proposition (1.10). Since in the proof of the triangulation theorem, the functions $f$ which ought to be extended to $A$ have sets of $\Phi^{-1}(K)$ as a domain, we need to consider $f\circ \Phi$ in the situation of lemma (2.2), which also needs $\Phi$ to be continuous. I am confused a bit now because this paper calls the ""definable homeomorphisms"" in the triangulation theorem ""definable bijections"", hence not necessarily continuous (referring to the attribute of a homeomorphism as structure preserving in case of the ""definable"" structure). Page 4 says: A definable homeomorphism is a tame bijection between tame sets.  To repeat: definable homeomorphisms are not necessarily continuous. When you want to define the so called definable Euler characteristic like on page 4 here Definition 2.2. If $X\in\mathcal{O}$ is tame and $h:X\rightarrow \cup \sigma_i$ is a definable bijection with a collection of open simplices, then the definable Euler characteristic of X is: $\chi(X):=\sum_{i}(-1)^{dim\;\sigma_i}$ , where $dim\;\sigma_i$ is the dimension of the open simplex $\sigma_i$ . We understand that $\chi(\emptyset)=0$ since this corresponds to the empty sum. where, in my opinion, the definable bijection term arises from the understanding of a definable homeomorphism as a definable bijection, because in the same paper the triangulation theorem from van der Dries book is cited as: Theorem 2.1 (Triangulation Theorem [16]). Any tame set admits a definable bijection with a subcollection of open simplices in the  geometric realization of a finite Euclidean simplicial complex. Moreover, this bijection can be made to respect a partition of a tame set into tame subsets. Although page 70 of van den Dries book basically says a definable injection suffices for the well-definedness of the Euler characteristic (2.4) Proposition: If $f:S\rightarrow R^n$ is an injective definable map, then $E(S)=E(f(S))$ . a definable homeomorphism in sense of a definable, bijective, continuous function with continuous inverse, will make life in case of the well-definedness of the definable Euler characteristic much easier, because there wont be any need to refer to (2.4) of van den Dries book. I browsed van den Dries' book a bit, but i didn't find the definition of a ""definable homeomorphisms"". So do they need to be definable, bijective and continous with a continuous inverse or do they only need to be definable and bijective (which leads to a problem with the remark (2.3) above). Thank you in advance,  Soucerer","I am currently working through the proof of the so called ""triangulation theorem"" on page 130 in Lou van den Dries book ""Tame Topology and o-minimal Structures."". Triangulation Theorem: Let be a definable set, with definable subsets . Then has a triangulation in that is compatible with these subsets. I got ruminative at the following passage: ""Therefore we modify as follows to . Each extends, first continuously to the   closure of its domain, and then, by the last remark of (2.3), further to a continuous definable function ."" I went on and looked up the remark (2.3), which, in my opinion, demands the function in the definition of a triangulation to be continuous in both directions (i.e. a topological homeomorphism), in order to fullfill. The full ""remark"" (2.3) in vdD book is: (2.3) Definition. Let be a definable set. A triangulation in of is a pair consisting of a complex in and a definable homeomorphism . Note that then is a finite partition of A. We call a triangulated set. The triangulation is said to be compatible with the subset if is a union of elements of . Note that by Chapter 6.(1.10), we have: A is closed and bounded the complex K is closed (where is a definable set). In that case each continuous definable R-valued function on , where , has a continuous definable R-valued extension to A, by lemma (2.2). Where chapter 6, (1.10) says: (1.10) Proposition. If is a continuous definable map on a closed bounded set , then is closed and bounded in . and lemma (2.2) says (2.2) Lemma. Let be a closed complex in and a closed subcomplex. Then each continuous definable function has a continuous definable extension . So, in order to apply lemma (2.2) we need a closed simplicial complex , which follows from the continuity of (here we need the continuity) and proposition (1.10). Since in the proof of the triangulation theorem, the functions which ought to be extended to have sets of as a domain, we need to consider in the situation of lemma (2.2), which also needs to be continuous. I am confused a bit now because this paper calls the ""definable homeomorphisms"" in the triangulation theorem ""definable bijections"", hence not necessarily continuous (referring to the attribute of a homeomorphism as structure preserving in case of the ""definable"" structure). Page 4 says: A definable homeomorphism is a tame bijection between tame sets.  To repeat: definable homeomorphisms are not necessarily continuous. When you want to define the so called definable Euler characteristic like on page 4 here Definition 2.2. If is tame and is a definable bijection with a collection of open simplices, then the definable Euler characteristic of X is: , where is the dimension of the open simplex . We understand that since this corresponds to the empty sum. where, in my opinion, the definable bijection term arises from the understanding of a definable homeomorphism as a definable bijection, because in the same paper the triangulation theorem from van der Dries book is cited as: Theorem 2.1 (Triangulation Theorem [16]). Any tame set admits a definable bijection with a subcollection of open simplices in the  geometric realization of a finite Euclidean simplicial complex. Moreover, this bijection can be made to respect a partition of a tame set into tame subsets. Although page 70 of van den Dries book basically says a definable injection suffices for the well-definedness of the Euler characteristic (2.4) Proposition: If is an injective definable map, then . a definable homeomorphism in sense of a definable, bijective, continuous function with continuous inverse, will make life in case of the well-definedness of the definable Euler characteristic much easier, because there wont be any need to refer to (2.4) of van den Dries book. I browsed van den Dries' book a bit, but i didn't find the definition of a ""definable homeomorphisms"".

At the very beginning of this volume I unfortunately found the first osbtacle: pick a commutative ring with unity $R$ , and consider $f \in R$ as a function on Spec $R$ . The authors define $f(\mathfrak{p})$ as the image of $f$ via the canonical maps $$R \rightarrow R/\mathfrak{p}\rightarrow k(\mathfrak{p}) $$ with $k(\mathfrak{p})$ the residue field of $R/\mathfrak{p}$ . If I'm not wrong, $k(\mathfrak{p})=((A/\mathfrak{p})\setminus \{[0]\})^{-1}A/\mathfrak{p}$ , which should be equal to $k(\mathfrak{p}) \simeq A_{\mathfrak{p}}/\mathfrak{p}A_{\mathfrak{p}}$ (but I can't figure out how, all this localisations confuse me). The problem is that I'm getting confused with all this stuff, I mean, I always naively consider the function $15$ at $(7)$ , then $15((7))=1$ mod $7$ , or working over $k[x]$ , $$x^3-1((x^2+1))= -x-1 (\text{ mod } (x^2+1)).$$ But I don't see all this machinery behind this computation, I can do the calculation but I feel I don't undertand what $A_{\mathfrak{p}}/\mathfrak{p}A_{\mathfrak{p}}$ is and why I'm working in this exact space. Any help which clarifies the theoretic aspect of this calulations would be appreciate, I'm quite confused about this ring. Thanks in advance.","I recently started studying the theory of schemes from ""The geometry of schemes"", by Eisenbud and Harris.
