1,Non-isomorphisms of orders,Non-isomorphisms of orders,,"Task: Let A = $\{ (x, y) \in \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} : x ⩾ y \}$ and B = $\{ (x, y) \in \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} : x ⩽ y\}$ . Consider the restriction of the lexicographic order $\mathbb{N} \times_{lex} \mathbb{N}$ on these sets: a pair $(x_{1} , y_{1})$ is less than a pair $(x_{2} , y_{2} )$ if $x_{1} < x_{2}$ or $x_{1} = x_{2}$ and $y_{1} < y_{2}$ . Are these orders isomorphic on sets A and B? My thinking: Usually, when proving an isomorphism, it is enough to give a bijection $f$ , which works as follows: $(x_{1}, y_{1}) < (x_{2}, y_{2}) \Rightarrow f((x_{1}, y_{1})) < f((x_{2}, y_{2}))$ . No matter how much I try to bring such a bijection, I come to the conclusion that when constructing it, the condition $(x_{1}, y_{1}) < (x_{2}, y_{2}) \Rightarrow f((x_{1}, y_{1})) < f((x_{2}, y_{2}))$ is violated. It turns out that it is necessary to prove that these orders are not isomorphic. It seems impossible to prove that such a bijection does not exist, since both sets A and B are infinite, therefore there can also be an infinite number of bijections, at least it seems to me an irrational approach to solving this task. (if this is incorrect, then point out my mistake to me). Usually non-isomorphisms are proved as follows: the minimum/maximum/smallest/largest elements from one order do not pass into the minimum/maximum/smallest/largest elements of another order each segment of power $[x, y]$ does not pass into the segment $[f(x), f(y)]$ which has the same power limit elements they do not pass into limit elements of a different order I'm not quite able to figure out how to use this to prove non-isomorphism.

54,Solving a colour sudoku,Solving a colour sudoku,,"I have designed a new type of sudoku-like puzzle, done on a 5*5 grid, with the following rules: each row and column contains one and only one of each integer 1-5 each row and column contains one and only one of each colour (eg red, blue, yellow, green, black) there is one and only one of each integer-colour combination (eg one blue 3) It is easy to create a solved colour-sudoku. One simply cycles through the integers in one direction (first row is 12345, second row is 23451, third row is 34512 etc) and cycles through the colours in the opposite direction (first row is ABCDE, second row is EABCD, third row is DEABC). One can then conduct various transformations of this solution: interchanging any two colours with each other, or interchanging any two numbers swapping any two rows or columns rotating the board I have several questions relating to colour sudokus: What is the minimum number of squares which must be filled in order to determine a unique solution? I have done it with 5, but might it be done with fewer? Are there other solutions which cannot be generated through the transformations described above? If so, how many? How would the answers to the above questions change if we played on a different size of grid? Edit: this is a board in which 5 determines a unique solution. The large numbers in bold are the starting numbers. It is easy to deduce that '2A' must go in the top right corner (all other rows and columns have either a '2' or an 'A'). This enables us to figure out where '4A' and '5A' go, and also '2B' and '2E'.

Problem here is that I can't find a closed expression for $f(x)$. Clearly, $(1+x)^{2n}=\sum_{k=0}^{2n}\binom{2n}{k}x^k$, but how can I take out only the first 'half' of the terms? Second thing I tried was to take $g(x)=(1+x)^{2n}$ and then denote $G(x)=\frac16x^3\left(xg'(x)\right)'''$. Then $G(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{2n}k\binom{k}{3}\binom{2n}{k}x^k$.

These numbers are in decimal expansion. Now I first imagine trying this for finding the number of n-digit numbers that don't have two consecutive digits.  If I am correct I have 10 choices for the first (we are in decimal expansion so 0 counts), then 9 choices for the second, 9 for the third and so on.  So we would have $10*9^{n-1}$ possible numbers.  This looks like it works for n = 2 as we would have 10 numbers {00,11,..,99} that are repeated.  I however wonder about 00, if that should be counted here, but for n > 2 I could have .001 etc.  I however figure that if .00 is not a valid number in decimal expansion then it also won't have to be removed.  Hence I have 90 numbers which work.  I can't quite see in to the n = 3 case though - it is this next digit (and so on) that boggle me. Now I rigged up a recurrence relation that seems to work for the n = 1 and n = 2 case in the no consecutive 2 digit case.  It is: $T(n) = 10^n - T(n-1) -1$  where T(0) = 0. $T(1) = 10^1 - T(0) - 1 = 9$  Note that 0 is not counted for n = 1 as it is .0 (hence the -1 included) $T(2) = 10^2 - T(1) - 1 = 10^2 - (10^1 - T(0) - 1) - 1 = 100 - (10 - 0 - 1) - 1 = 90$ Since I don't know what T(3) is supposed to be I didn't bother putting it in.  If this Recurrence relation works, perhaps someone would have a combinatorial reason why it works?

99,Confusion Over The Definition of a Transposition Cipher,Confusion Over The Definition of a Transposition Cipher,,"In our Discrete Mathematics class, the way the textbook introduces the transposition cipher is as follows: As a key we use a permutation $\sigma$ of the set $\{1, 2, \ldots , m\}$ for some positive integer $m$ , that is, a one-to-one function from $\{1, 2, \ldots, m\}$ to itself. To encrypt a message we first split its letters into blocks of size $m$ . We encrypt the block $p_1p_2\ldots p_m$ as $c_1c_2\ldots c_m = p_{\sigma(1)}p_{\sigma(2)}\ldots, p_{\sigma(m)}$ . To decrypt a ciphertext block $c_1c_2, \dots c_m$ , we transpose its letters using the permutation $\sigma^{−1}$ , the inverse of $\sigma$ . And then an example is brought up, where a transposition cipher is done. Using the transposition cipher based on the permutation $\sigma$ of the set $\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ with $\sigma(1) = 3$ , $\sigma(2) = 1$ , $\sigma(3) = 4$ , and $\sigma(4) = 2$ , encrypt the plaintext message PIRATE ATTACK...We first split the letters of the plaintext into blocks of four letters. We obtain PIRA TEAT TACK. To encrypt each block, we send the first letter to the third position, the second letter to the first position, the third letter to the fourth position, and the fourth letter to the second position . We obtain IAPR ETTA AKTC. The confusion arises because given the notation $c_1c_2\ldots c_m = p_{\sigma(1)}p_{\sigma(2)}\ldots p_{\sigma(m)}$ , wouldn't the ciphered text be in the form $p_3p_1p_4p_2$ (rather than the suggested $p_2p_4p_1p_3$ )? I've looked online and it may be that the difference is caused because the permutation is an active permutation, not a passive one, but I still find this to not make sense.","In our Discrete Mathematics class, the way the textbook introduces the transposition cipher is as follows: As a key we use a permutation of the set for some positive integer , that is, a one-to-one function from to itself.
