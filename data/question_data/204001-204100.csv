1,How do you move between an observer's frame orbiting a Kerr B-H and the B-H's frame? In context of photon emission from accretion disk.,How do you move between an observer's frame orbiting a Kerr B-H and the B-H's frame? In context of photon emission from accretion disk.,,"I'm struggling with the concept of moving to and from reference frames in GR. I'm doing a problem in Spacetime and Geometry by S. Carroll (Chapter 6, Question 6 - the text for the question is very long) and it's the idea of iron in an accretion disk on geodesics emitting photons of known frequency $$\nu_{0}$$ and then, depending on where the photon is emitted and the direction of rotation of the accretion disk compared to the Kerr B-H, what is the frequency of the photon measured by an observer very far away. One method I tried was using, from earlier in the book, $$\omega = -g_{\mu \nu}U^{\mu}\frac{dx^{\nu}}{d\lambda}$$ then if you assume the observer is stationary, and in the equatorial plane (as given in the question) you get that $$\omega = (1 - \frac{2GM}{r})^{\frac{-1}{2}}E$$ from the Killing vector and the normalisation of U in the Kerr metric. Then I think that the energy will be conserved along the Killing vector so just take $$E = \nu_{0}$$ if hbar = 1. So you end up with the formula $$\frac{\omega}{\nu_{0}} = (1 - \frac{GM}{r})^{\frac{-1}{2}}$$ which is just the Schwarzchild redshift formula right? So clearly this doesn't depend on anything to do with the accretion disk, or even the 'angular momentum' of the Kerr B-H, and I definitely feel like I'm doing something wrong. Furthermore, I have rearranged the Killing vectors for L and E then used them, and the fact the photon is on a null path in the equatorial plane, to get the full form for the dx/d(lambda) in terms of conserved quantities. I want to try doing the idea of moving between frames of a particle in the accretion disk but I'm really struggling with deriving the transformation between the particle's rest frame and then Black-Hole's frame. I'm thinking along the lines of the preservation of the line element and saying that, in a very small vicinity around the particle, spacetime looks like Minkowski spacetime so, using again that we're in the equatorial plane, $$ds^2 = -dt'^2 + dr'^2 + r^2d{\phi'}^2 = -(1 - \frac{2GM}{r})dt^2 + \frac{2GMa}{r}(dtd{\phi} + d{\phi}dt) + \frac{r^2}{\Delta}dr^2 + \frac{\Sigma^2}{r^2}d{\phi}^2$$ where $$\Sigma^2 = [(r^2 + a^2)^2 - a^2{\Delta} ] || \Delta = r^2 - 2GMr + a^2$$ then if you leave all the other components constant, you get the effects of, for example, $$\frac{dr'}{dr} = \frac{r}{\sqrt{\Delta}} $$ I'm really not sure if this is correct. I've also had some ideas like $$U^{\mu'} = \frac{\partial{x^{\mu'}}}{\partial{x^{\mu}}}U^{\mu}$$ where the particle frame is un-primed and the Black-Hole frame is primed, but still I'm struggling to find (convincingly) the partial derivatives. Please can someone give me a push in the right direction? I'm self studying (lockdown and all that) and I feel I'm missing some little conceptual, well basic, ideas like this. I don't know if this is against Stack Exchange policy, but please can you not give a full answer to Carroll's question, I would still like to try and fill in the gaps!","I'm struggling with the concept of moving to and from reference frames in GR.

I'm trying to prove the following (Problem 10-23 in John Lee's ""Introduction to Riemannian Manifolds""): Suppose $q \in \mathrm{Cut}(p)$ satisfies $d_g(p,q) = d_g(p,\mathrm{Cut}(p)) = \mathrm{inj}(p) =: b$ . Then either $q$ is conjugate to $p$ along some minimizing geodesic segment, or there are exactly two unit-speed geodesic segments $\gamma_0, \gamma_1 : [0,b] \to M$ such that $\dot\gamma_0(b) = -\dot\gamma_1(b)$ . By "" $p$ is conjugate to $q$ "", we mean there is a Jacobi field $J$ along a geodesic from $p$ to $q$ with $J(p) = 0$ and $J(q) = 0$ ; or equivalently, there is a proper smooth variation through geodesics from $p$ to $q$ . Furthermore, $\mathrm{inj}(p)$ denotes the injectivity radius at $p$ . What I've tried: By a previous result, assuming $q$ is not conjugate to $p$ along any minimizing geodesic, there are at least two minimizing unit-speed geodesics $\gamma_0$ and $\gamma_1$ from $p$ to $q$ . Suppose $\dot\gamma_0(b) \neq -\dot\gamma_1(b)$ . Let $\gamma : [0,2b] \to M$ be the closed loop based at $p$ given by $\gamma_0$ and (the reversed parametrization of) $\gamma_1$ , and let $\Gamma : [0,\delta] \times[0,2b] \to M$ be a smooth variation along $\gamma$ through unit-speed curves that coincide with $\gamma_0$ and $\gamma_1$ outside of an $\epsilon$ -neighborhood of $q$ , and inside this $\epsilon$ -neighborhood of $q$ , the variation field $V$ satisfies $V(b) = -\left(\dot\gamma_0(b) + \dot\gamma_1(b)\right)$ . Assume $\Gamma_0 = \gamma$ . (Essentially, we are slightly shortening and contracting the loop $\gamma$ by ""rounding the corner"" at $q$ .) One can show there is a small $s \in (0,\delta]$ such that $L_g(\Gamma_s) < L_g(\gamma) = 2b$ . Suppose the image of $\Gamma_s$ differs from the image of $\gamma$ on the interval $[b-\epsilon, a]$ for some $a \in (b-\epsilon, b+\epsilon]$ . Let $\sigma = \Gamma_s|_{[b-\epsilon,a]}$ . I've been able to show that $\sigma$ does not intersect $\mathrm{Cut}(p)$ . So $\sigma$ is a smooth curve in $M$ within the injectivity radius of $p$ . Because $\exp_p$ is a diffeomorphism near $0$ onto its image, and that image includes $\sigma$ , we can project $\sigma$ to a curve $\tilde\sigma$ on the unit sphere in the tangent space $T_pM$ . So let $\Sigma : [b-\delta, a] \times [0,b] \to M$ be the variation given by $$ \Sigma(s,t) = \exp_p\left(t\tilde\sigma(s)\right). $$ Then $\Sigma$ is a variation through unit-speed geodesics that start at $p$ . My question: Can we show $\Sigma$ is a proper variation? If so, this would contradict our assumption that $q$ is not conjugate to $p$ along any minimizing geodesic. I know that by minimality, the first time each curve $\Sigma_s : [0,b] \to M$ can possibly intersect either $\gamma_0$ or $\gamma_1$ is at $t=b$ . Also, the curve $\Sigma(\cdot, b) : [b-\delta, a] \to M$ is a closed curve based at $q$ . So it suffices to show this curve is constant. Is there an obvious reason why this should be the case? EDIT: See comments for a solution sketch of the original problem. Constructing a proper variation through geodesics, as I was trying to do, turns out not to be the most straightforward approach; it's better to use the fact that $q$ is a regular value of $\exp_p : T_p M \to M$ if we assume $q$ is not conjugate to $p$ .","Suppose is a complete, connected Riemannian manifold, , and denotes the cut locus of , i.e. the set of all points so that there is a minimizing geodesic from to that ceases to be minimizing past .

5,Petersen's proof of Weitzenböck identity,Petersen's proof of Weitzenböck identity,,"I realize that my question will sound silly, but I am reading Petersen's book on Riemannian geometry (third edition) and I can't quite figure out one step in his proof of the Weitzenböck identity for forms (Theorem 9.4.1, page 347). My notation is as follows. Let $T$ be a tensor on a Riemannian manifold $M$ , with Levi-Civita connection $\nabla$ and let $R$ denote the curvature tensor with the following sign convention $$R(X,Y)T=\nabla^2_{X,Y}T-\nabla^2_{Y,X}T=\nabla_X(\nabla_Y T)-\nabla_Y(\nabla_X T)-\nabla_{[X,Y]}T$$ where $\nabla^2_{X,Y}T=\nabla_X(\nabla_YT)-\nabla_{\nabla_X Y}T$ . Let $\{E_1,\dots,E_n\}$ be a local orthonormal frame. Then, for a $k$ -form $\omega$ on $M$ and local vector fields $X_0,X_1,\dots,X_k$ we have that its exterior derivative can be expressed as $$(d\omega)(X_0,\dots,X_k)=\sum_{i=0}^n(-1)^i(\nabla_{X_i}\omega)(X_0,\dots,\widehat{X}_i\dots,X_k)$$ and the $L^2$ -adjoint $\delta$ of $d$ is given by $$(\delta\omega)(X_2,\dots,X_k)=-\sum_{j=0}^n(\nabla_{E_j}\omega)(E_j,X_2,\dots, X_k)$$ Finally, let us define the tensor $\text{Ric}(\omega)$ by $$(\text{Ric}(\omega))(X_1,\dots,X_k)=\sum_{i,j=1}^n (R(E_j,X_i)\omega)(X_1,\dots,E_j,\dots,X_k)$$ where $E_j$ is in the $i$ -th slot, instead of $X_i$ . Let the ""rough Laplacian"" $\Delta=-\nabla^*\nabla$ be defined as $\sum_j \nabla^2_{E_j,E_j}$ , so that $$-(\Delta\omega)(X_1,\dots,X_k)=(\nabla^*\nabla\omega)(X_1,\dots,X_k)=-\sum_j(\nabla^2_{E_j,E_j}\omega)(X_1,\dots,X_k)$$ and let the De Rham Laplacian $\Delta_H$ be defined as usual by $\Delta_H=d\delta+\delta d$ , so that $$(\Delta_H\omega)(X_1,\dots,X_k)=(d(\delta\omega)+\delta(d\omega))(X_1,\dots,X_k)$$ The Weitzenböck identity in question is $$\Delta_H\omega=\nabla^*\nabla\omega+\text{Ric}(\omega)$$ I have no problems in showing that $$(\delta d\omega)(X_1,\dots,X_k)=(\nabla^*\nabla\omega)(X_1,\dots,X_k)+\sum(\nabla^2_{E_j,X_i}\omega)(X_1,\dots,E_j,\dots,X_k)$$ but I can't seem to get the other half of the formula, i.e. $$(d\delta\omega)(X_1,\dots,X_k)=-\sum(\nabla^2_{X_i,E_j}\omega)(X_1,\dots,E_j,\dots,X_k)$$ I'll explain the problem  in the basic case where $k=1$ , i.e. $\omega$ is a 1-form and $\delta\omega$ is a smooth function. Let $X$ be a local vector field. Then $$(d\delta\omega)(X)=X(\delta\omega)=-\sum X((\nabla_{E_j}\omega)(E_j))=-\sum\left((\nabla_X(\nabla_{E_j}\omega))(E_j)+(\nabla_{E_j}\omega)(\nabla_X E_j)\right)$$ and it is not clear to me that the term inside the sum is the second covariant derivative $(\nabla^2_{X,E_j}\omega)(E_j)$ . I know I could fix the problem by adapting the frame so that $\nabla_{E_i}E_j=0$ at a point and use tensoriality, but I was trying to see if I could get the full calculation in a general orthonormal frame to work out.

Why did it vanish?,\frac{\partial}{\partial t} R_{ik} -2g^{jp}g^{lq}R_{pq}R_{ijkl},"I'm trying to prove that under the Ricci flow, the Ricci tensor evolves by the following equation: $$\frac{\partial}{\partial t} R_{i k}=\Delta R_{i k}+2 g^{p q} g^{r s} R_{p i k r} R_{q s}-2 g^{p q} R_{i p} R_{q k}$$ This is corollary $4.18$ of Ben Andrew's ""The Ricci Flow in Riemannian Geometry"" book. Now, the proof they give there starts like this: Where $(4.9)$ is given by: $$\frac{\partial}{\partial t} g^{i j}=-g^{i k} g^{j \ell} h_{k \ell}$$ and Theorem $4.14$ is: $$\begin{aligned} \frac{\partial}{\partial t} R_{i j k \ell}=& \Delta R_{i j k \ell}+2\left(B_{i j k \ell}-B_{i j \ell k}-B_{i \ell j k}+B_{i k j \ell}\right) \\ &-g^{p q}\left(R_{p j k \ell} R_{q i}+R_{i p k \ell} R_{q j}+R_{i j k p} R_{q \ell}+R_{i j p \ell} R_{q k}\right) \end{aligned}$$ where $$B_{i j k \ell}=g^{p r} g^{q s} R_{p i q j} R_{r k s \ell}=R_{i j}^{p q} R_{p k q \ell}$$ Now, I see where all the terms in my first picture (with the red outlined term) are coming from. I understand they ought to be here. But the term $-2g^{jp}g^{lq}R_{pq}R_{ijkl}$ outlined in red just vanished! And the authors never mention it again. What happened here? I've been staring at this for a long while now but can't figure this out. I would be really grateful for any help. I think this is probably a mistake on my part, because in Hamilton's $1982$ original paper, the same ""mistake"" is there, so I think there must be something going on here that I'm not seeing. Thanks in advance! UPDATE: I think a mistake was indeed committed by the authors, but overall the work is correct. First of all, the term I outlined in red has the wrong sign, it should be ${+2g^{jp}g^{lq}R_{pq}R_{ijkl}}$ rather than $\color{red}{-2g^{jp}g^{lq}R_{pq}R_{ijkl}}$ , as one can easily check (and in Hamilton's original paper the sign is correct).

25,On algebraic minimal surfaces,On algebraic minimal surfaces,,"In the theory of minimal surfaces, we could construct various types of minimal surface based on the way we choose a pair of holomorphic & meromorphic fucntion. To be more specific, let $f(\zeta)$ be a holomorphic function on an open set $U$ in the complex plane, not identically zero while $g(\zeta)$ be a meromorphic function on the same domain such that if $\zeta_0$ is a pole of order $m \geq 1$ of $g$ then it is a zero of order $\geq 2m$ of $f$ then we have a parametrization of a minimal surface $$\sigma(u,v) = \mathfrak{Re} \int \varphi(\zeta)d\zeta, \zeta = u + iv$$ in which $\sigma$ is a surface patch and $\varphi = \frac{1}{2}(f(1-g^2),if(1+g^2),2fg)$ . For example when $(f,g) = (2,\zeta)$ we have the classical Enneper surface $$\sigma(u,v) = (u - \frac{u^3}{3} + uv^2, -v + \frac{v^3}{3} - u^2v, u^2 - v^2)$$ In this wikipedia , I know that the classical Enneper surface is algebraic which means that it can be defined as the zero locus of a polynomial of degree $9$ . Naturally, I can generalize this example by choosing $(f,g)=(2,\zeta^n)$ which gives us $$\sigma(u,v) = (x(u,v),y(u,v),z(u,v)$$ in which $$x(u,v) =  u - \frac{1}{2n+1}\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{2n+1}{2k+1}u^{2k+1}(iv)^{2(n-k)}$$ $$y(u,v) =  -v - \frac{1}{2n+1}\sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{2n+1}{2k}u^{2k}i^{2(n+1)-2k}v^{2n+1-2k}$$ $$z(u,v) =   2\sum_{2 \mid k-n-1}\binom{n+1}{k}u^k i^{n+1-k}v^{n+1-k} \ (0 \leq k \leq n+1)$$ and hope these general Enneper surfaces are algebraic.

26,Divergence theorem for non-compact manifolds,Divergence theorem for non-compact manifolds,,"I wonder whether there is a generalization of the divergence theorem or more generally of Stokes' theorem to non-compact domains or manifolds, much like the improper Riemann integrals. Consider the function $f(x, y) = \frac{1}{x^2 y^2}$ integrated over the domain $D = [1, \infty)^2$ . This can be written as a nested improper Riemann integral and turns out as $1$ . Now this did not really use the divergence theorem, but consider a similar case for the divergence theorem where all integrals would be finite since the integrands decay quickly enough at infinity. If I understand it correctly, the generalized Stokes' theorem (and as a special case also the divergence theorem) still apply if the domain is not fully bounded in all directions as long as the integrand has compact support. But $\frac{1}{x^2 y^2}$ has no compact support in $D$ . First question: Is there a generalization relaxing the compact support requirement? Such that it is enough that all integrals exist? So far I found (Karp - On Stoke's Theorem For Noncompact Manifolds, https://www.jstor.org/stable/2043967 ), but that requires complete manifolds. (Edit: It was pointed out that $D$ is cauchy complete. Although the article does not explicitly state it, I assume it refers to geodesical completeness, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic_manifold . This assumption makes sense for the article as it deals with geodesic balls and grows them towards infinity. For clearness I'll add ""geodesically"" to every occurrence of ""complete"" in the following.) $[1, \infty)^2$ is not geodesically complete, right? It appears to me that something similar should hold if the manifold or the domain is geodesically complete in some directions but bounded in other directions, possibly in more complicated manner than $[1, \infty)^2$ . E.g. consider a domain like $\{(x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \colon y > x^2\}$ . My idea so far: If we had a nested sequence of compact domains $C_0 \subset C_1 \subset \ldots \subset D$ such that $\lim\limits_{j \to \infty} C_j = D$ , one can apply Stokes' Theorem to $f|_{C_j}$ and observe if the result converges as $j \to \infty$ . This is much like the technique behind improper Riemann integrals, but growing a compact domain instead of an interval towards an improper boundary part. Here it is probably helpful that ""in good cases"" ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_(mathematics)#Compact_support ) compactly supported functions lie densely in the set of functions that vanish at infinity. Second question: This construction is so simple it must be well known. I kindly ask for references where this is studied, material about this. Is there some pitfall that prevents us using it to apply Stokes' or the divergence theorem to manifolds or domains that are not compact or possibly neither compact nor geodesically complete? (Otherwise, why is it so hard to find a formulation for cases that are neither compact nor geodesically complete?) Third question: I am not much interested in pathological cases and assume that the integrand has no singularities. For my usecase, it can be assumed to be strictly positive, possibly zero at the boundary or at infinity. However, there certainly are pathological cases and it would be good to know conditions (on $f$ and $D$ ) to exclude them. For $D$ this should be somewhat weaker than geodesically complete or compact. Note: There are a couple of similar questions but I did not find a satisfying(ly answered) one.

I am thinking about the map $f(z) : \mathbb{C}\setminus\mathbb{R}^\leq \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ given by $f(z) = \log(z)$ . I know that the logarithm is analytic on this domain, therefore it must be conformal, which means the mapping has to  preserve angles. This implies some geometric properties of the space after the mapping is applied to it. For example, any triangle must have angles that add up to $180^\circ$ , or $\pi$ .

Let $e \in G$ be the identity of $G$ . Let $p \in M$ . Let $G_p$ denote the stabiliser subgroup of $G$ , $G_p :=$ $\{g \in G$ $| \alpha(p,g) = \alpha_p(g) = p\}$ , where $\alpha_p$ is the smooth map $\alpha_p: G \to M$ , known as the orbit map, with $\alpha_p(g) = \alpha(p,g)$ . Observe the image of $\alpha_p$ is $\alpha_p(G)= \alpha(p,G)$ , the orbit of $p$ . Observe that $\alpha^{-1}(p) = G_p$ . The continuity of $\alpha$ gives us the following: Since $M$ is a T1 space, since $M$ is a T2 space, we have $G_p$ to be a closed subset of $G$ . It can be shown $G_p$ is a subgroup of $G$ . Since $G_p$ is a closed subgroup of $G$ , it follows by the closed subgroup theorem that $G_p$ is not merely a Lie group that is also a subset of $G$ but an embedded Lie subgroup of $G$ . (Also, you can show something like $\alpha_p$ is equivariant and thus has constant rank and thus $G_p$ is embedded.) For the inclusion map $i: G_p \to G$ , we have its differential at $e$ to be $i_{\{*,e\}}: T_e(G_p) \to T_eG$ , an injective $\mathbb R$ -linear map of $\mathbb R$ -Lie algebras. The image of $i_{\{*,e\}}$ is $i_{\{*,e\}}(T_e(G_p))$ , an $\mathbb R$ -vector subspace of $T_eG$ and is isomorphic to $T_e(G_p)$ . Consider the exponential map $\exp: T_eG \to G$ . Since $T_eG$ is an $\mathbb R$ - vector space, $tA \in T_eG$ for all $A \in T_eG$ and for all $t \in \mathbb R$ . Therefore, the expression ' $\exp(tA)$ ' is defined. Question : For all $A \in T_eG$ , is $A \in i_{\{*,e\}}(T_e(G_p))$ (or $A \in T_e(G_p)$ under the aforementioned isomorphism) if and only if for each $t \in \mathbb R$ , $\exp(tA) \in G_p$ ? Note: That $\exp(tA) \in G_p$ for each $t \in \mathbb R$ is I think equivalent to that the map $s_p : \mathbb R \to G$ , with $s_p = \exp \circ \hat{A}$ has image as a subset of $G_p$ , where $\hat{A}: \mathbb R \to T_eG$ , $\hat{A}(t) = tA$ . Also, I believe $s_p$ and $\hat{A}$ are smooth maps. It seems like $(\alpha_p \circ \exp)^{-1}p = i_{\{*,e\}}(T_e(G_p))$ or something, but I really don't know how to begin proving this. This is supposed to be a lemma in proving that for the fundamental vector field $\xi(A)$ , of $A$ under $\xi: T_eG \to C^{\infty}(M,TM)$ , we have $\xi(A)_p = Z_p$ if and only if $A \in i_{\{*,e\}}(T_e(G_p))$ , where $Z_p \in T_pM$ is the zero element of $T_pM$ . Also, I'm aware that $c_p := \alpha_p \circ s_p$ is the integral curve of $\xi(A)$ starting at $p$ . Thanks in advance! My answer : Okay I think I discovered the answer, which is affirmative, and I think I can answer without using, for a second time, the fact that $G_p$ is closed. The 'only if' direction is shown under the naturality of the exponential map, which states that for a Lie group homomorphism $F: G \to B$ , $F \circ \exp_B = \exp_G \circ F_{\{*,e\}}$ , where $\exp_B: T_{e_B} \to B$ and $\exp_G: T_eG \to G$ where $e_B$ is the identity of $B$ . Here, we have ' $F$ ' as $i$ , ' $B$ ' as $G_p$ . For $A \in i_{\{*,e\}}(T_e(G_p))$ , let $C = i_{\{*,e\}}^{-1} A \in T_e(G_p)$ . Then $$(F \circ \exp_B)(C) = (i \circ \exp_{G_p})(C) = \exp_{G_p}(C) \in G_p,$$ and $$(F \circ \exp_B)(C) = (\exp_G \circ i_{\{*,e\}})(C) = \exp_G (A).$$ Therefore, $\exp_G (A) \in G_p$ if $A \in i_{\{*,e\}}(T_e(G_p))$ . This applies for any $A \in i_{\{*,e\}}(T_e(G_p))$ including its multiples $tA \in i_{\{*,e\}}(T_e(G_p))$ , where $tC = t(i_{\{*,e\}}^{-1} A) = i_{\{*,e\}}^{-1} (tA) \in T_e(G_p)$ .

63,Why are differential forms so convenient? (In applied mathematics),Why are differential forms so convenient? (In applied mathematics),,"This is a soft question to understand better why differential forms are so useful, especially in applied mathematics. I own Tu's - Introduction to Manifolds , and I'll quote the introduction of section 18: Differential forms are generalizations of real-valued functions on a manifold. Instead   of assigning to each point of the manifold a number, a differential k-form assigns to   each point a k-covector on its tangent space. For k = 0 and 1, differential k-forms are   functions and covector fields respectively Differential forms play a crucial role in manifold   theory. First and foremost, they are intrinsic objects   associated to any manifold, and so can be used to   construct diffeomorphism invariants of a manifold.   In contrast to vector fields, which are also intrinsic   to a manifold, differential forms have a far richer algebraic structure. Due to the existence of the wedge   product, a grading, and the exterior derivative, the   set of smooth forms on a manifold is both a graded   algebra and a differential complex. Such an algebraic structure is called a differential graded algebra. Moreover, the differential complex of smooth   forms on a manifold can be pulled back under a   smooth map, making the complex into a contravariant functor called the de Rham complex of the manifold. We will eventually construct the de Rham cohomology of a manifold from the de Rham complex.   Because integration of functions on a Euclidean space depends on a choice of   coordinates and is not invariant under a change of coordinates, it is not possible to   integrate functions on a manifold. The highest possible degree of a differential form   is the dimension of the manifold. Among differential forms, those of top degree turn   out to transform correctly under a change of coordinates and are precisely the objects   that can be integrated. The theory of integration on a manifold would not be possible   without differential forms. From this introduction, and plus what the text actually covers on the subject, it seems to me that the main advantage of the differential forms over vector fields is their algebraic structure (which is much richer than the vector fields one). However I do struggle to understand if once I get used to the formalism it actually makes easier to model certain geometric problems. There's another book from the same author ( Tu's - Differential geometry ) where the formalism of forms is used to derive the structure equations, which are still differential forms. I own such book as well, but I also own Do Carmo's - Riemannian Geometry , and I've been reading the three of them lately. The thing is Do Carmo doesn't seem to make use of differential forms at all to develop his theory (except in the exercises), Tu instead uses differential forms as I mentioned. This difference strikes me, since I can't quite figure what sort of ""modelling"" advantage differential forms give over normal vector fields to model certain problems. There're also few papers (Computer Graphics papers) that I've been reading through lately where the differential forms formalism is actually used to design certain algorithms to process meshes, so they must have some modelling advantage that I don't understand. Can anyone clarify? Update : As further clarification I think I can give, I'm asking from the applied mathematics point of view. For example in triangular meshes processing, tools from differential geometry are used to compute laplacian, gradient etc, but the methods I'm aware don't really use differential forms, but I'm aware from some papers I've been reading in the last few months that differential forms are somehow used to model some problems, I can't understand though why such formalism is actually better in some situations. Please let me know if you like some quotes from some of the paper I'm talking about.","This is a soft question to understand better why differential forms are so useful, especially in applied mathematics. I own Tu's - Introduction to Manifolds , and I'll quote the introduction of section 18: Differential forms are generalizations of real-valued functions on a manifold. Instead   of assigning to each point of the manifold a number, a differential k-form assigns to   each point a k-covector on its tangent space. For k = 0 and 1, differential k-forms are   functions and covector fields respectively Differential forms play a crucial role in manifold   theory. First and foremost, they are intrinsic objects   associated to any manifold, and so can be used to   construct diffeomorphism invariants of a manifold.   In contrast to vector fields, which are also intrinsic   to a manifold, differential forms have a far richer algebraic structure. Due to the existence of the wedge   product, a grading, and the exterior derivative, the   set of smooth forms on a manifold is both a graded   algebra and a differential complex.

We know that $\mathbb{T}$ is a $2$ -dimensional embedded submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^3$ . Now consider $p = (1,0,0) \in \mathbb{T}.$ I want to find a local parametrization of $\mathbb{T}$ around $p$ , that is, a function $$f: U \to V, $$ where $V \subset \mathbb{T}$ is open in $\mathbb{T}$ and $p \in V$ , $U$ is an open set of $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $f$ is a diffeomorphism (or at least a homeomorphism), and after that, find a correspoding chart and adapted chart to $\mathbb{T}$ . Of course, I thought about the standard parametrization of the torus, that is, the function $$f: (\theta, \phi) \mapsto ((2+\cos(\theta))\cos(\phi), (2+\cos(\theta))\sin(\phi), \sin(\theta)). $$ However, how can I find an actual open set of $\mathbb{R}^2$ and an open set of $\mathbb{T}$ such that the above properties hold? We can see that, with the above function, $f(\pi, 0) = (1,0,0) = p.$ Hence, I thought about a neighbourhood of $(\pi, 0)$ , namely $\displaystyle U = \left( \frac{3\pi}{4}, \frac{5\pi}{4} \right) \times \left( -\frac{\pi}{4}, \frac{\pi}{4} \right) \subset \mathbb{R}^2.$ Obviously this is an open set of $\mathbb{R}^2$ . After that, I though about proving that $V = f(U)$ will be open in $\mathbb{T}$ (I chose this $V$ so that $f$ is bijective), but I am not sure how. In doing so, I thought about the chart of $\mathbb{T}$ around $p$ corresponding to $f$ , by which I mean $(V, \varphi)$ , with $\varphi: V \to U, \varphi = f^{-1}$ . I will remark that it is trivial to see that $f$ is smooth on $U$ . Furthermore, with this definition, we get that $$\varphi (x,y,z) = \left( \arcsin(z), \arctan \left( \frac{y}{x} \right) \right).$$ The function $\varphi$ is smooth if it is defined on a set that does not contain points $(x,y,z)$ with the property that $x = 0$ . Particularly, these type of points are not in $V$ by the definition of $U$ and $f$ , so $\varphi$ is smooth, hence, in particular, $f$ is a homeomorphism, so $V$ is an open set of $\mathbb{T}$ . Is this good enough for the question? Now, I want to find an adapted chart to $\mathbb{T}$ around $p$ , by which I mean a smooth chart of $\mathbb{R}^3$ , $(X, \chi)$ , with $X \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ open, $p \in X$ , $\chi$ diffeomorphism between $X$ and another open subset of $\mathbb{R}^3$ and $$\mathbb{T} \cap X = \{t \in X \ \mid \ \chi_3(t) = 0 \}, $$ where $\chi = (\chi_1, \chi_2, \chi_3)$ is the coordinate representation of $\chi$ . However, I don't know how to construct such an adapted chart to $\mathbb{T}$ . I know we can somehow determine it by using the previous parametrization $f$ and chart $\varphi$ , but I don't know how. Edit: I have thought a bit more about the last question. Observe that by letting $g: V \to \mathbb{R}, g(x,y,z) = 1 - \left( \sqrt{x^2+y^2}-2 \right)^2 - z^2$ , we have that $g$ is smooth on $V$ . Can we deduce that the function $\chi' = (\varphi, g)$ is such an adapted chart of $\mathbb{T}$ ? Edit 2: The function $\chi'$ would satisfy the property that $\mathbb{T}$ can be locally written as $g = 0$ , but I cannot find a good domain and range to define the function such that it is an actual chart (bijective, smooth, with smoot inverse). More specifically, it's not hard to choose a domain such that $\chi'$ is smooth, but how do I choose it such that it is bijective, because $g$ is a function from $\mathbb{R}^3$ to $\mathbb{R}$ , which is difficult to make injective.","Consider the torus embedded in , defined implicitly as Endow with the subspace topology of .

Suppose I had a principle $G$ bundle $P \xrightarrow\pi M$ and a connection 1-form $\omega$ . Given a local section $\sigma_i : U_i \to P$ , I can do two things with my connection Pull $\omega$ down to $U_i$ by defining $\omega_i = \sigma_i^*(\omega)$ I can use my section to trivialize $\pi^{-1}(U_i)$ by $h_i :U \times G \to \pi^{-1}(U_i) $ taking $(m,g) \mapsto \sigma_i(m) \cdot g $ . With this I can pull back $\omega$ to $U \times G$ by $\omega \mapsto h_i^* \omega$ . As I understand it, the Yang-Mills field is $\omega_i$ , i.e. the object defined on the local patch $U_i$ . The claim is that under change of section the Yang-Mills field transforms as $$\omega_j = Ad_{\Omega^{-1}}\omega_i + (R_\Omega)^*\theta$$ Where $\sigma_j = \sigma_i\cdot\Omega$ is a new section on $U_j$ , $(R_\Omega)^*$ is the pushforward arising from the right $G$ action, and $\theta$ is the Maurer-Cartan form on $G$ . However if I try and compute the transformation of the what I've been calling the Yang-Mills field I get something else. The action of $\omega_j$ on $v\in T_mU_j$ is $\omega_j(v) = \sigma_j^*\omega(v) = \omega({\sigma_j}_* v) = \omega((\sigma_i \cdot \Omega)_* v) = (R_\Omega^*\omega)({\sigma_i}_* v) = Ad_{\Omega^{-1}}[\omega({\sigma_i}_* v)] = Ad_{\Omega^{-1}}[\omega_i (v)]$ Where the first equality follows from the definition of $\omega_j$ , the next from the definition of the pushforward, the next follows from $\sigma_j = \sigma_i\cdot\Omega$ . The next equality follows from associativity of pushforward, the next equality follows from the definition of a connection 1 form, and the final equality follows from the definition of $\omega_i$ . All this seems to give me that $\omega_j = Ad_{\Omega^{-1}}\omega_i$ . On the other hand I know that $$h_i^*\omega = \omega_i + \theta$$ Again, $\theta$ is the Maurer-Cartan 1-form on G. In this case under change of section the $\omega_i$ should transform as I worked out before and $\theta$ should transform as any form defined on G, namely $\theta \mapsto (R_\Omega)^*\theta$ . this gives me that $$h_j^*\omega = Ad_{\Omega^{-1}}\omega_i + (R_\Omega)^*\theta$$ But this is precisely what is claimed to be the transformation properties of the Yang-Mills field.

73,Relating changes in unit vectors on a surface to the surface curvature,Relating changes in unit vectors on a surface to the surface curvature,,"I was reading today, and I came upon this identity: $\frac{\partial \mathbf e_p}{\partial p} + \frac{\partial \mathbf e_q}{\partial q} = -(\nabla \cdot \mathbf n) \mathbf n$ , where $\mathbf e_p$ and $\mathbf e_q$ are unit vectors in the directions p and q of a general surface $x(p,q,t)$ and $\mathbf n$ is the unit vector normal to the surface, such that $\mathbf n = \mathbf e_p \times \mathbf e_q$ .  The unit vector $\mathbf n$ points in the direction that the surface is propagating. I'd like to figure out how to prove this mathematically, but also understand it intuitively.  I see the curvature, in the form of $\nabla \cdot \mathbf n$ , but I haven't gotten any further. Edit: Here is my idea for a possible solution, but I think it is still a bit hand-wavy, so hopefully someone will be able to sharpen up the details. First of all, I could align $\mathbf e_p$ and $\mathbf e_q$ with the principle directions of the surface.  Then, the two principle curvatures would each have a magnitude given by $||\frac{d\mathbf T}{ds}||$ , where $\mathbf T$ is the tangent vector to the surface in the principle direction.  In the p direction this magnitude would be $||\frac{\partial \mathbf e_p}{\partial p}||$ and in the q direction it would be $||\frac{\partial \mathbf e_q}{\partial q}||$ .  I know that the mean curvature is given by $H=\kappa_1 + \kappa_2$ , where 1 and 2 are the principle directions, so, with my alignment of p and q, $H=\kappa_p + \kappa_q$ .  Since $H=\nabla \cdot \mathbf n$ (up to a sign (?), and a factor that depends on convention), this suggests that I'm nearly there, but I need to get the sign and direction right. The Direction The change in a tangent vector should point in either the n or -n direction.  This is well illustrated by the answer to What is the intuition behind the unit normal vector being the derivative of the unit tangent vector? So at this point I'm happy with $\frac{\partial \mathbf e_p}{\partial p} + \frac{\partial \mathbf e_q}{\partial q} = (\nabla \cdot \mathbf n) \mathbf n$ up to a sign.  The question is, what should the sign really be? This is where I start to get somewhat confused. The Sign In the set up described here, there is a surface with the normal vector pointing in the direction of propagation.  Imagine that the surface is shaped like a hill.  Then $\nabla \cdot \mathbf n$ will be positive, because moving the normal in any coordinate direction (x,y,z), assuming that z is upwards, will make the component of the normal in that direction larger.  Likewise, if I imagine a valley, $\nabla \cdot \mathbf n$ is negative.  (So at this point I think that the choice of the direction of n determines the sign of $\nabla \cdot \mathbf n$ . Is that really true?). But if I look at $\frac{\partial \mathbf e_p}{\partial p}$ and $\frac{\partial \mathbf e_q}{\partial q}$ for the hill case, it seems like  they should point in the - n direction because the change in the tangent vector points into the hill.  This would imply that there should be a negative sign because $\nabla \cdot \mathbf n$ is positive, but I need the final result to be in the - n direction.  So: $\frac{\partial \mathbf e_p}{\partial p} + \frac{\partial \mathbf e_q}{\partial q} = -(\nabla \cdot \mathbf n) \mathbf n$ At this point, though, I'm pretty suspicious of this negative sign.  Should it really be there? A final note This argument depended on aligning the p and q directions with the principle directions.

In relation to (1), I think (both local diffeomorphisms and) local diffeomorphisms onto images are local embeddings.

Perhaps assuming submanifold makes into something where it would be obvious that is indeed a local embedding, such as because is actually an embedding (I think isn't necessarily injective) or a local diffeomorphism (I think immersions are not necessarily local diffeomorphisms). We might be able to characterize such immersions as equivalent to local diffeomorphisms onto their images . But in this case I think this would mean that surjective immersions are (surjective) local diffeomorphisms. While this would be consistent with both that bijective immersions are diffeomorphisms and that bijective local diffeomorphisms are diffeomorphisms, I wasn't able to find anything about surjective immersions being local diffeomorphisms, but I think this is true if and even if not surjective (and immersions would be local diffeomorphisms onto their images if , I guess). In relation to (1), I think (both local diffeomorphisms and) local diffeomorphisms onto images are local embeddings. Since immersions are equivalent to local embeddings , I guess a local embedding with a submanifold image is a local diffeomorphism onto image. For such an , we can say is an immersion if and only if is an immersion . I suppose we might say this even if weren't a submanifold or maybe even if not a manifold as long as we have some kind of smoothness definition .",\dim {\text{domain}} = \dim{\text{range/image}} \dim {\text{domain}} = \dim{\text{image}} n=k N M n m p \in N F: N \to M p F p F p \in N F(N) M k M F N F(N) \tilde F: N \to F(N) F F \iota: F(N) \to M \tilde F: N \to F(N) F F = \iota \circ \tilde F N F(N) n=k F(N) F F(N) F F F F n=m n=k F F \tilde F F(N),"['general-topology', 'differential-geometry']"

93,A set which is the closure of its interior points,A set which is the closure of its interior points,,"I am trying to give a sufficient condition for a set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ which is the closure of its interior points. A priori, such a set has to be a closed set. A closed set in general is not the closure of its interior point. A trivial counter example is a set with empty interior, e.g the segment $[0,1]\times \{0\}$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ . So the next candidate is one with non empty interior. One can come up with a counter example is a sphere with hair, e.g the union of $\{x^2+y^2 \le 1\} \cup [1,2]\times \{0\}$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ . So to avoid these kinds of counter example, I propose the following question (""conjecture"" may be?) Question 1: Let $K$ be a closed connected subset of $\mathbb{R}^n , n \ge 2$ with nonempty interior $Int(K)$ . Suppose that the boundary $\partial K$ is a connected submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^n$ . Then $K = \overline{Int(K)}$ . Note: By submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^n$ I mean an embedded submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^n$ . In particular, $\partial K$ is orientable. The connectivity assumption on $K$ is to avoid the case that $K$ has an isolated point. I am not sure that I need the connectivity of the boundary $\partial K$ . The reason I put it there because the fact that $K$ is connected does not implies that $\partial K$ is connected. This is due to this question Connectedness of the boundary which asserts that (if I understood correctly) a connected set $K$ has connected boundary if and only if the complement $K^c= \mathbb{R}^n \setminus K$ is connected.  Again, the counter example to this situation (connected set with non-connected boundary) does not satisfy the assumption that the boundary itself is a submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^n$ . But even with this question I don't know how to tackle yet so just assume that $\partial K$ is a connected submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^n$ . My attempt: I am able to give an argument in the case when $K$ is compact. My argument goes as follows: Since $K$ connected, $Int(K)$ has no isolated point and $\overline{Int(K)} = Int(K) \cup \partial Int(K)$ . Note that $K = Int(K) \cup \partial K$ thus $\partial Int(K) \subset \partial K$ . Since $K$ is compact, $\partial K$ is a compact, connected submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^n$ . Denote by $k$ the codimension of $\partial K$ . It is enough to prove that $\partial Int(K)= \partial K$ . If $k \ge 2$ : consider a point $x \in \partial Int(K)$ and a local chart $(U,\varphi)$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ so that $\varphi(U) =\mathbb{R}^n$ and $$\varphi(U \cap \partial K) = \mathbb{R}^{n-k} \times \{0\} $$ Since $k \ge 2$ , it follows that $U \setminus \partial K$ is connected. On one hand, since $x \in \partial Int(K)$ , $U \cap Int(K) \neq \emptyset$ . On another hand, we have a decomposition $$U \setminus \partial K = (U \cap Int(K)) \cup (U \cap K^c)$$ of $U$ as two disjoint open set. Thus the connectivity of $U \setminus \partial K$ implies that $U \cap K^c = \emptyset$ , i.e. $U \subset K$ . Since $U$ open, $U \subset Int(K)$ which yields a contradiction since $U$ contains a boundary point of $Int(K)$ . We deduce that $\partial K$ is a compact hypersurface of $\mathbb{R}^n$ which is orientable. By ""Lima, Elon L. ""The Jordan-Brouwer separation theorem for smooth hypersurfaces."" The American Mathematical Monthly 95.1 (1988): 39-42."", I can deduce that $\mathbb{R}^n \setminus \partial K$ has two connected component $U_1,U_2$ whose boundaries are exactly $\partial K$ . As $K^c$ is connected, without loss of generality, I assume that $K^c \subset U_1$ . It is enough to prove that $Int(K) \subset U_2$ , hence $Int(K) = U_2$ and it follows that $\partial U_2 = \partial Int(K)  = \partial K$ . Suppose that $Int(K) \setminus U_2 \neq \emptyset$ , thus $Int(K) \cap U_1 \neq \emptyset$ . Note that $$U_2 = (U_2 \cap Int(K)) \cup (U_2 \cap \partial Int(K)) \cup (U_2 \cap \overline{Int(K)}^c).$$ Hence by connectivity of $U_2$ , we can deduce that $U_2 \cap \partial Int(K) \neq \emptyset$ which is a contradiction since $\partial Int(K) \subset Int(K) \cap U_2 =\emptyset$ . (This is in fact an argument for a general fact: If $U$ is an open connected subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ then for every $V \subset U$ and $V \neq U$ , we have $\partial V \cap U \neq \emptyset$ .) Is my argument correct? I am really grateful if anyone can come up with a proof or a counter example of Question 1 , with or without the hypothesis of connectivity of $\partial K$ . I prefer arguing by not so complicated machinery (not homology, cohomology, Mayer-Viertoris sequence, etc..)
