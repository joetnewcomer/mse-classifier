28,Taylor series for $e^{a x} J_0 (b x)$,Taylor series for,e^{a x} J_0 (b x),"How to derive the general term for the Taylor series around $0$ for this function? I found, using Wolfram Alpha, that: $$e^{a x} I_0 (|a| x)= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(2n)!}{n!^3} \frac{(a x)^n}{2^n}$$ I suspect that there should be a nice series for the general function. $$f(a,b,x)=e^{ax} J_0 (bx)$$ I see several ways to derive it: Finding an ODE for $f(a,b,x)$ and solving it with power series. Then maybe a recurrence relation will allow us to find a closed form for the coefficients. Using the integral representation of the Bessel function.

I've taken the following steps. Consider $x_n$ $$ \begin{align} x_n &= \ln^2(n+1) - \ln^2n = \\  &= (\ln(n+1) + \ln n)(\ln (n+1) - \ln n) = \\ &= \ln \frac{n + 1}{n}\cdot \ln (n(n+1)) = \\ &= \ln\left({1 + {1\over n}}\right)\cdot \ln(n(n+1)) \end{align} $$ Now multiply and divide by $n$ : $$ \begin{align} x_n &= {n \over n} \ln\left({1 + {1\over n}}\right)\cdot \ln(n(n+1)) = \\ &= \ln\left({1 + {1\over n}}\right)^n \cdot\ln \sqrt[^n]{(n(n+1))} \end{align} $$ Now consider $\left({1 + {1\over n}}\right)^n$ . There are plenty of proofs that it is bounded. In my case I've used expansion with binomial coefficients to prove that : $$ 2< \left({1 + {1\over n}}\right)^n < 3 \implies \\ \ln2 < \ln \left({1 + {1\over n}}\right)^n < \ln3 $$ So now we want to prove that $\ln \sqrt[^n]{(n(n+1))}$ is bounded. Start with the following: $$ \ln \sqrt[^n]{n(n+1)} < \ln \sqrt[^n]{(n+1)^2} $$ Consider the following equation: $$ \begin{align} \sqrt[^n]{(n+1)^2} &= 1+a_n \iff \\ \iff (n+1)^2 &= (1+a_n)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{n}{k}a_n^k \end{align} $$ Now: $$ \sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{n}{k}a_n^k \ge \frac{n(n+1)}{2}a_n^2 \implies \\ \implies (n+1)^2 \ge \frac{n(n+1)}{2}a_n^2 \implies \\ \implies a_n \le \sqrt{2 + {2\over n}} $$ So $a_k$ is clearly bounded. Which means: $$ \sqrt[^n]{(n+1)^2} < 1 + \sup\{a_n\} = 3 $$ Also $\sqrt[^n]{(n+1)^2} > 1$ . So: $$ \ln1 < \ln \sqrt[^n]{(n(n+1))} < \ln3 $$ Now going back to initial expression: $$ \ln1 \cdot \ln2 < \ln\left({1 + {1\over n}}\right)^n \cdot\ln \sqrt[^n]{(n(n+1))} < \ln3 \cdot \ln3 $$ Meaning $x_n$ is bounded.

49,Computing series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 1/n^2$ using Fourier Series,Computing series  using Fourier Series,\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 1/n^2,"Suppose that $f$ be defined as $x^2$ on $[-\pi,\pi]$, and then extended to a periodic function on all of $\mathbb{R}$.  Express f as a sum of cosine terms and then use it to compute $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 1/n^2$. I feel like something may be off with my Fourier Series.  Computing Fourier Series coefficients, $$a_n=1/\pi *\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} x^2*cos(nx) dx$$ $$b_n=1/\pi *\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} x^2*sin(nx) dx$$ $b_n$ is always 0 as $f(x)$ is an even function.  Taking n to be 0, I get:$$a_n=1/\pi *\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} x^2 dx=$$=$2\pi^{2}/3$. Generally computing the integral I get:$$a_n=1/\pi *\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} x^2*cos(nx)  dx$$= Now, this is where I get confused.  I know $sin(\pi*n)$ is always 0 for any n.  However, the right hand side is $-4/n^2$ when n is odd but when it is even it is $4/n^2$. If $a_n$ is $ -4/n^2$, then the Fourier series is:  $$f=\pi^2/3-\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 4/n^2*cos(nx)$$.  If I plug in $\pi$, I get $f(\pi)=\pi^2$ and I get this expression above to be $$\pi^2/3-\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^n* 4/n^2$$.  So I have equating the two $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{n+1}4/n^2=2\pi^2/3$$.$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{n+1}/n^2=\pi^2/6$$. I get the alternating series of $1/n^2$ to be $\pi^2/6$. However, the answer should be $\pi^2/6$ for not the alternating series, but $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 1/n^2$=$\pi^2/6$, the alternating series does not equal this. If I try $a_n$=$4/n^2$, I get the same incorrectly weird answer. Thus, I believe there is a problem with my $a_n$ . If anyone, could help me spot the error, that would be much appreciated.

Looking at the numbers that come after the chain of $3$ s . I would want to prove that it will always be one. $a_i = \sum_{k=0}^{2i-1} 10^k$ where $i\in\Bbb{N^+}$ $\sqrt{a_1}-3.3=0.0166247903...$ $\sqrt{a_2}-33.33=0.0016666249...$ $\sqrt{a_3}-333.333=0.0001666666...$ To formulate this $\sqrt{a_i} - \frac{3a_i}{10^i}$ Get the first number to the left of the decimal point, by multiplying it with $10$ s. $\biggl(\sqrt{a_i} - \frac{3a_i}{10^i}\biggl)10^{i+1}=: b_i$ $b_1=1.66247903..., b_2=1.6666249..., b_3=1.666666...,$ etc. To prove that $1<b_i<2$ , in other words, show that the series $b_i$ isn't decreasing. For $<2:$ $\lim_{i\to \infty}b_i=\lim_{i\to \infty}\biggl(\sqrt{a_i} - \frac{3a_i}{10^i}\biggl)10^{i+1}=\frac{5}{3}=1.6666666666666666666666....$ The limit was calculated by Maple 2015. The limit being $1.66666...$ means that $b_i$ will be getting closer to that value. This proves the $<2$ part. Missing What I think I'm missing is proving that $b_i$ isn't decreasing. Just because $b_1$ starts at $1.6624...$ and eventually $b_i$ will end up close to $1.666666666666...$ doesn't mean that it hasn't decreased somewhere along the way.

Maybe the fact that $a_i$ is rising can help somehow? [ EDIT ] I may found a way, it's not nice. We know that the first couple of values of $b_i$ are increasing, therefore I tried to show that $b_i$ is not increasing by finding the derivative of the function $b_i$ (thank you Maple). Then having the derivative be equaled to zero, there is no such case, therefore there are no critical points, so the sequence doesn't change between increasing or decreasing, and since the first few values of $b_i$ were increasing, the entire sequence cannot be decreasing, making it non-decreasing.

For The limit was calculated by Maple 2015. The limit being means that will be getting closer to that value. This proves the part. Missing What I think I'm missing is proving that isn't decreasing. Just because starts at and eventually will end up close to doesn't mean that it hasn't decreased somewhere along the way. I tried showing that but got stuck at: Maple is giving me a FAIL on the verify and evalb functions, which means that I don't know how to use Maple properly. Maybe the fact that is rising can help somehow? [ EDIT ] I may found a way, it's not nice. We know that the first couple of values of are increasing, therefore I tried to show that is not increasing by finding the derivative of the function (thank you Maple). Then having the derivative be equaled to zero, there is no such case, therefore there are no critical points, so the sequence doesn't change between increasing or decreasing, and since the first few values of were increasing, the entire sequence cannot be decreasing, making it non-decreasing. Is this proof rock solid in general, or are there still some gaps to improve upon?","1000 \sqrt{11...11} 1998 1 1 \sqrt{11} = 3.3166247903... =: \sqrt{a_1} \sqrt{1111} = 33.3316666249... =: \sqrt{a_2} \sqrt{111111} = 333.3331666666... =: \sqrt{a_3} 1 n 1 \frac{n}{2}  3 \frac{n}{2}  3 1998 1 999 3 999 3 1 33...33.33....331 1 1000 i = \frac{n}{2} 1998  1 i=999 3 a_i = \sum_{k=0}^{2i-1} 10^k i\in\Bbb{N^+} \sqrt{a_1}-3.3=0.0166247903... \sqrt{a_2}-33.33=0.0016666249... \sqrt{a_3}-333.333=0.0001666666... \sqrt{a_i} - \frac{3a_i}{10^i} 10 \biggl(\sqrt{a_i} - \frac{3a_i}{10^i}\biggl)10^{i+1}=: b_i b_1=1.66247903..., b_2=1.6666249..., b_3=1.666666..., 1<b_i<2 b_i <2: \lim_{i\to \infty}b_i=\lim_{i\to \infty}\biggl(\sqrt{a_i} - \frac{3a_i}{10^i}\biggl)10^{i+1}=\frac{5}{3}=1.6666666666666666666666.... 1.66666... b_i <2 b_i b_1 1.6624... b_i 1.666666666666... b_i<b_{i+1} \sqrt{a_i}<10\sqrt{a_{i+1}} -3 \cdot 10^i \cdot 11 a_i b_i b_i b_i b_i","['sequences-and-series', 'limits', 'discrete-mathematics', 'proof-verification']"
