0,Is every Borel set finitely decomposable into open sets?,Is every Borel set finitely decomposable into open sets?,,"Given a topological space $\langle X, T \rangle $, consider the Borel algebra $B$ generated by $T$. The question is, can you write any $b \in B$ using only finitely many open (or closed) sets using set operations $\cup$ and $\sim$ (and $\cap$) ? For closed and open sets, this is obviously the case. So the characterization is only interesting for sets which are neither open nor closed. For example, consider $\mathbb{R}$ with the standard topology and the following set: $$A = \{\frac{1}{n} : n \in \mathbb{N}\}.$$ $A$ is a Borel set and obviously, $A$ is neither open nor closed. But $A' = A \cup \{ 0 \}$ is closed and one can rewrite $A$ as $A' \setminus \{ 0 \}$. Since both sets are closed, $A$ is ""finitely decomposable into open (or closed) sets.""

I don't think triangle inequality will hold in that sense that $$\left\lvert a-b \right\rvert^p \leq \left\lvert a \right\rvert^p+\left\lvert b \right\rvert^p$$ for any $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$. So I am thinking even if I could manage to do this, I would still have something like $$\int \left\lvert f-\phi \right\rvert^p \mathrm{d}\mu \leq \int \left\lvert f^+-\phi_n \right\rvert^p \mathrm{d}\mu + \int \left\lvert f^--\psi_n \right\rvert^p \mathrm{d}\mu$$ which doesn't seem to help if $\mu(X)=\infty$. Was thinking I could say something like: $$\int \left\lvert f^--\psi_n \right\rvert^p \mathrm{d}\mu < \int (\varepsilon^{1/p})^p \mathrm{d}\mu$$ but this falls apart if $\mu(X)=\infty$. Any help is appreciated thanks.",,[]

The following result holds: Let $B\subset L^\infty(X)$ be a  set of real valued functions which is bounded (that is, there exists $c>0$ with $\|f\|_\infty\leq c$ for all $f\in B$ ). Then $B$ admits a least upper bound $g$ in $L^\infty(X)$ . As far as I can tell, the straightforward argument that one first thinks about does not work; because one would attempt to take the pointwise supremum, which of course will be bounded but there is no obvious reason why it has to be measurable. Moreover, taking the pointwise supremum raises the issue of dealing with possibly uncountably many nullsets, which kind of puts the argument away from usual measure theory. The reason I know the result is true is the following. For any $F\subset B$ finite, we can define $g_F=\max\{f:\ f\in F\}$ . Because we are dealing with finitely many functions, $g_F\in L^\infty(X)$ and $f\leq g_F$ a.e. for all $f\in F$ . Now the net $\{g_F\}_{F\in B}$ is a monotone increasing bounded net of real-valued functions. Here is where I need to appeal to higher level stuff: since $L^\infty(X)$ is a von Neumann algebra, any bounded monotone increasing net of selfadjoint elements admits a least upper bound.  So there exists $g\in L^\infty(X)$ that is the least upper bound of $\{g_F\}_{F\in B}$ . The reason $g$ is a least upper bound for $B$ is that if $h$ is an upper bound for $B$ , then $g_F\leq h$ for all $F$ , and then $g\leq h$ . And now we get to the question: is it possible to prove the existence of the least upper bound for $B$ , with measure theory arguments? The proof using von Neumann algebra ideas is not crazy hard, but it uses non-trivial results. Basically one represents $L^\infty(X)$ faithfully on $B(\ell^2(X))$ acting by left multiplication, that is $\pi(f)\eta=f\,\eta$ , and considers the numerical nets $\{\langle \pi(g_F)\xi,\xi\rangle\}$ for each $\xi\in \ell^2(X)$ . As these are bounded monotone nets in $\mathbb R$ , they converge. This way one gets numbers $\{\langle T\xi,\xi\rangle\}$ and it is standard Hilbert space theory using polarization that this defines an operator $T\in B(\ell^2(X))$ . The operator $T$ is a weak-operator limit of elements of $\pi(L^\infty(X))$ , which is a von Neumann algebra, and so $T\in \pi(L^\infty(X))$ , which means that there exists $g\in L^\infty(X)$ with $\pi(g)=T$ . It would be nice to have instead a proof intrinsic to $L^\infty(X)$ .","Let be a measure space and consider the algebra . The real-valued functions carry a canonical order, where if a.e.

(The book pdf: https://measure.axler.net/MIRA.pdf ) Let $\nu$ be a complex measure on measurable space $(X,\mathscr S)$ , and $|\nu|:\mathscr S\to[0,\infty]$ be the total variation of $\nu$ , i.e., $$|\nu|(E) =\{|\nu(E_1)|+\cdots+|\nu(E_n)| \ ;\ n\in\mathbb N, E_1,\cdots,E_n \in\mathscr S \ \mathrm{are \ disjoint,\ }\ E_1\cup\cdots\cup E_n\subset E \}.$$ Then, $|\nu|$ is a positive measure on $(X,\mathscr S)$ . What I have to see is: (i) $|\nu|(\emptyset)=0$ (ii) $|\nu|(\cup_{k=1}^\infty A_k)=\sum_{k=1}^\infty|\nu|(A_k)$ for disjoint $\{A_k\}_k\subset\mathscr S.$ I understand (i), and for (ii), I understand $|\nu|(\cup_{k=1}^\infty A_k)\leqq\sum_{k=1}^\infty|\nu|(A_k)$ but I don't see the proof of the other direction. The written proof is as follows. Fix $m\in\mathbb N.$ For each $k\in\{1,\cdots,m\}$ , suppose $n_k\in\mathbb N$ and $E_{1,k}\ ,\dots,E_{n_k\ ,k}\in\mathscr S$ are disjoint s.t. $$E_{1,k}\cup\cdots\cup E_{n_k\ ,k}\subset A_k.$$ Then, $\{E_{j,k}\ ; 1\leq k\leq m, 1\leq j\leq n_k\}$ is a disjoint collection of sets in $\mathscr S$ that are contained in $\cup_{k=1}^\infty A_k.$ Thus $$\sum_{k=1}^m\sum_{j=1}^{n_k}|\nu(E_{j,k})|\leqq |\nu|(\cup_{k=1}^\infty A_k).$$ Taking the spremum of the left side over all choices of $\{E_{j,k}\}$ , we get $$\sum_{k=1}^m|\nu|(A_k)\leqq |\nu|(\cup_{k=1}^\infty A_k).$$ Letting $m\to\infty$ , I get the result. I don't understand the part Taking the spremum of the left side over all choices of $\{E_{j,k}\}$ , we get $$\sum_{k=1}^m|\nu|(A_k)\leqq |\nu|(\cup_{k=1}^\infty A_k).$$ Now, for each $k,$ we have, by the definition, $$|\nu|(A_k)=\{|\nu(E_{1,k})|+\cdots+|\nu(E_{n_k\ ,k})| \ ;\ n_k\in\mathbb N, E_{1,k}\ \dots,E_{n_k\ ,k} \in\mathscr S \ \mathrm{are \ disjoint\ }\ E_{1,k}\cup\cdots\cup E_{n_k\ ,k}\subset A_k \}.$$ At the first part, we picked arbitrarily $n_k\in\mathbb N$ and $E_{1,k},\dots,E_{n_k,k}\in\mathscr S$ so that they are disjoint and satisfy $$E_{1,k}\cup\dots\cup E_{n_k,k}\subset A_k,$$ so I think it is appropriate to take the supremum over all choices of $E_{1,k}\ ,\cdots,E_{n_k,k}$ , instead of $\{E_{j,k}\}$ . If we take the supremum over the choices of $\{E_{j,k}\}$ , we have to pick $\{E_{j,k}\}$ arbitrarily at first. What's going on here?

My solution is here: Let $f$ be an $\mathcal{S}$ -measurable real-valued function on $X.$ Let $A:=\{a\in\mathbb{R}:f^{-1}((a,\infty))\text{ is countable}\}.$ We prove that $A$ is not empty. Assume that $A=\emptyset.$ Then, $f^{-1}((a,\infty))$ is uncountable for any $a\in\mathbb{R}.$ Then, $X\setminus f^{-1}((a,\infty))=f^{-1}((-\infty,a])$ is countable for any $a\in\mathbb{R}.$ Since $X=f^{-1}(\mathbb{R})=f^{-1}(\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{Z}} (-\infty,n])=\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}f^{-1}((-\infty,n])$ , $X$ is countable. Let $a\in\mathbb{R}.$ Since $f^{-1}((a,\infty))\subset X$ , $f^{-1}((a,\infty))$ is countable. This is a contradiction. So, $A$ is not empty. Let $a_1\in A.$ Let $a_2$ be any element of $\mathbb{R}$ such that $a_1<a_2.$ Then, $f^{-1}((a_2,\infty))\subset f^{-1}((a_1,\infty)).$ Since $f^{-1}((a_1,\infty))$ is countable, $f^{-1}((a_2,\infty))$ is countable. So, if $a_1\in A$ , then $a_2\in A$ for any $a_2\in\mathbb{R}$ such that $a_1<a_2.$ So, if $A$ is not bounded below, $A=\mathbb{R},$ if $A$ is bounded below, $A=(b,\infty)$ or $A=[b,\infty)$ for some $b\in\mathbb{R}.$ First, we consider the case $A=(b,\infty)$ for some $b\in\mathbb{R}.$ $f^{-1}((b,\infty))$ is uncountable since $b\notin A.$ So, $f^{-1}((-\infty,b])=X\setminus f^{-1}((b,\infty))$ is countable. Let $\epsilon$ be any positive real number. Then, $f^{-1}((b+\epsilon,\infty))$ is countable since $b+\epsilon\in A.$ Therefore, $f^{-1}((b,b+\epsilon])=f^{-1}((b,\infty))\setminus f^{-1}((b+\epsilon,\infty))$ is uncountable. Next, we consider the case $A=[b,\infty)$ for some $b\in\mathbb{R}.$ $f^{-1}((b,\infty))$ is countable since $b\in A.$ Let $\epsilon$ be any positive real number. $f^{-1}((b-\epsilon,\infty))$ is uncountable since $b-\epsilon\notin A.$ $f^{-1}((-\infty,b-\epsilon])=X\setminus f^{-1}((b-\epsilon,\infty))$ is countable. $f^{-1}((b-\epsilon,b])=f^{-1}((b-\epsilon,\infty))\setminus f^{-1}((b,\infty))$ is uncountable. Conversely, let $f$ be a real-valued function on $X$ which satisfies one of the following conditions: $f^{-1}((a,\infty))$ is countable for any $a\in\mathbb{R}.$ There exists $b\in\mathbb{R}$ such that for any positive real number $\epsilon$ , $f^{-1}((b+\epsilon,\infty))$ is countable  and $f^{-1}((b,b+\epsilon])$ is uncountable and $f^{-1}((-\infty,b])$ is countable. There exists $b\in\mathbb{R}$ such that for any positive real number $\epsilon$ , $f^{-1}((b,\infty))$ is countable  and $f^{-1}((b-\epsilon,b])$ is uncountable and $f^{-1}((-\infty,b-\epsilon])$ is countable. If $f$ satisfies 1, then $f$ is an $\mathcal{S}$ -measurable real-valued function on $X.$ Suppose that $f$ satisfies 2. Then, $f^{-1}((c,\infty))$ is countable if $b<c$ since there exists a positive real number $\epsilon$ such that $b+\epsilon<c.$ Then, $X\setminus f^{-1}((c,\infty))=f^{-1}((-\infty,c])$ is countable if $c\leq b.$ So, $f$ is an $\mathcal{S}$ -measurable real-valued function on $X.$ Suppose that $f$ satisfies 3. Then, $f^{-1}((c,\infty))$ is countable if $b\leq c.$ Then, $X\setminus f^{-1}((c,\infty))=f^{-1}((-\infty,c])$ is countable if $c<b$ since there exists a positive real number $\epsilon$ such that $c<b-\epsilon.$ So, $f$ is an $\mathcal{S}$ -measurable real-valued function on $X.$ Is my solution ok? Even if my solution is ok, the conditions 1, 2 and 3 are not simple. How to improve this?","I am reading ""Measure, Integration & Real Analysis"" by Sheldon Axler.

It should be relatively straightforward since $S^d$ is finite-dimensional, so we should be able to ""copy the one-dimensional procedure componentwise"", see e.g. the comment on this highly related question or this pretty similar question , but I don't know how to do that. For $d = 1$ I have the following: consider $$ \Psi: [M(\Theta, \mathbb R)]^* \to C(\Theta; \mathbb R), \qquad Z \mapsto \big(\theta \mapsto Z(\delta_{\theta})\big), $$ where $\delta_{\theta}(A) := \begin{cases} 1, & \text{if } \theta \in A, \\ 0, &\text{else.}\end{cases}$ is the Dirac measure at $\theta \in \Theta$ for $A \in \Sigma$ . This map is clearly linear. It is also injective: for $Z_1, Z_2 \in [M(\Theta; \mathbb R)]^*$ we have $\Psi(Z_1) = \Psi(Z_2)$ if and only if $Z_1(\delta_{\theta}) = Z_2(\delta_{\theta})$ for all $\theta \in \Theta$ . By the linearity of $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ this implies that $Z_1$ agrees with $Z_2$ on any spike train $\sum_{k = 1}^{n} a_k \delta_{\tilde{\theta}_k}$ for $n \in \mathbb N$ , $(a_k)_{k = 1}^{n} \subset \mathbb R$ and $(\tilde{\theta}_k)_{k = 1}^{n} \subset \Theta$ . By the continuity of $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ and the density of those spike trains in $M(\Theta; \mathbb R)$ , we can conclude that $Z_1 = Z_2$ . As inverse I suggest $$ \Psi^{-1}(f) := \left(\mu \mapsto \int_{\Theta} f(\theta) \; \text{d}\mu(\theta) \right). $$ Indeed, for $f \in C(\Theta; \mathbb R)$ we have $$ \Psi(\Psi^{-1}(f)) = \Psi\left(\mu \mapsto \int_{\Theta} f(\theta) \; \text{d}\mu(\theta) \right) = \left( \tilde{\theta} \mapsto \int_{\Theta} f(\theta) \; \text{d}\delta_{\tilde{\theta}}(\theta\right) = f. $$ Furthermore, for $Z \in [M(\Theta; \mathbb R)]^*$ we have $$ \Psi^{-1}(\Psi(Z)) = \Psi^{-1}\left(\theta \mapsto Z(\delta_{\theta})\right) = \left( \mu \mapsto \int_{\Theta} Z(\delta_{\theta}) \;\text{d}\mu(\theta) \right). $$ Due to the linearity of $Z$ we have for any spike train as above $$ \big[\Psi^{-1}(\Psi(Z))\big]\left(\sum_{k = 1}^{n} a_k \delta_{\tilde{\theta}_k} \right) = \sum_{k = 1}^{n} a_k Z(\delta_{\tilde{\theta}_k}) = Z \left(\sum_{k = 1}^{n} a_k \delta_{\tilde{\theta}_k} \right). $$ Hence by continuity of $Z$ and the density of the spike trains we conclude $\Psi^{-1}(\Psi(Z)) = Z$ . What are the higher-dimensional analogues of $\Psi$ and $\Psi^{-1}$ ? I tried $\Psi(Z) := \big(\theta \mapsto Z(P \delta_{\theta})\big)$ , where $P = \text{id}_{d \times d} \in S^d$ and $\Psi^{-1}(f) := \left( \mu \mapsto \text{tr}\left( \int_{\Theta} f(\theta) \; \text{d}\mu(\theta)\right)\right)$ , but they don't seem to fulfil either $\Psi \circ \Psi^{-1} = \text{id}_{C(\Theta; S^d)}$ nor $\Psi^{-1} \circ \Psi = \text{id}_{[M(\Theta; S^d)]^*}$ . Update When equipping $M(\Theta; S^d)$ with the (strong) generalised total variation norm, then by Singer's representation theorem we have the opposite duality $[C(\Theta; S^d)]^* \cong M(\Theta; S^d)$ via the dual pairing $$ \langle \phi, u \rangle_{C(\Theta; S^d) \times M(\Theta; S^d)} = \int_{\Theta} \langle \phi(\theta), u'(\theta) \rangle_{S^d} \; \text{d}| u |(\theta), $$ where $| u | \in M(\Theta; [0, \infty))$ is the total variation measure of $u$ and $u'$ is the Radon-Nikodym derivative of $u$ with respect to $| u |$ .

I wrote a solution involving Zorn's lemma, but I'm not really satisfied using this non-standard result. I'm wondering if there is an easier solution that gets around this lemma. Suppose $\mathcal{S}\subset\mathcal{T}$ are $\sigma$ -algebras on $X$ , $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ are measures on $(X,\mathcal{S})$ and $(X,\mathcal{T})$ , respectively, and $\mu_1(E)=\mu_2(E)$ $\forall \,E\in\mathcal{S}$ . Prove that if $f:X\to[0,\infty]$ is $\mathcal{S}$ -measurable, then $\int fd\mu_1=\int fd\mu_2$ . Edit: $(X,\mathcal{S})$ and $(X,\mathcal{T})$ are generic measurable spaces, and my definition of integral is $\int fd\mu=\sup\{\sum_{A_i\in P}\mu(A_i)\inf_{A_i}(f)|P\text{ is a partition of } X\}=\sup\{\sum_i c_i\mu(A_i)|\sum_i c_i\chi_{A_i}\leq f\}$ . Here the $c_i$ can be chosen arbitrarily from $\mathbb{R}$ , so I didn't expect to partition the range of $f$ . My reasoning: Cleary $\int fd\mu_1\leq\int fd\mu_2$ since $\mathcal{S}\subset\mathcal{T}$ , so we need the inequality on the other direction. No matter how our strategy is, we need to say that for any partition of $\{F_i\}\subset2^\mathcal{T}$ , we can find another partition $\{E_i\}\subset2^\mathcal{T}$ that approximates the integral better. The choice of $\{E_i\}$ clearly will depend on $\{F_i\}$ , so we kind of need to find a refinement using only sets from $\mathcal{S}$ . The problem is that if some $F_i\in2^\mathcal{T}-2^\mathcal{S}$ then there will be some elements that ""goes out of"" $F_i$ and the refinement will not work. However we can go around this if we can find a $F_i\subset E_i$ such that $f$ has the same range on them, and here comes Zorn's lemma. Proof: By Zorn's lemma, there exists a minimal set $E_i\in\mathcal{S}$ such that $F_i\subset E_i$ . Then $$f(F_i)\subset f(E_i)$$ and $$F_i\subset f^{-1}(f(F_i))\cap E_i\subset f^{-1}(f(E_i))\cap E_i=E_i$$ . But $f$ is $\mathcal{S}$ -measurable, so $f^{-1}(f(F_i))\cap E_i\in\mathcal{S}$ , and by minimality $f^{-1}(f(F_i))\cap E_i=E_i\Longleftrightarrow E_i\subset f^{-1}(f(F_i))$ . Finally $$f(E_i)\subset f(f^{-1}(f(F_i)))\subset f(F_i)\subset f(E_i)\Longrightarrow f(F_i)=f(E_i)$$ . Now we can consider the $m$ subsets $\tilde{E_j}$ generated by intersection of the $n$ $E_i$ s: These form a partition. Then $$\sum_{F_i}\mu_2(F_i)\inf_{F_i}(f)=\sum_{F_i}\sum_{\tilde{E_j}}\mu_2(F_i\cap\tilde{E_j})\inf_{E_i}(f)\leq\sum_{\tilde{E_j}}\sum_{F_i}\mu_2(F_i\cap\tilde{E_j})\inf_{\tilde{E_i}}(f)=\sum_{\tilde{E_j}}\mu_1(\tilde{E_j})\inf_{\tilde{E_i}}(f)$$ as desired.","This is an exercise I've been working a whole day.

Due to the lack of spherical/cylindrical symmetry (at least at a first glance), I have tried to come up with a solution using cartesian coordinates. First of all, plotting the section for $y=0$ , it can be geometrically argued that $x \in [0,1+\sqrt{2}]$ . The following idea is to study the transversal sections for each value of $x \in [0,1+\sqrt{2}]$ . Fix $x \in [0,1+\sqrt{2}]$ , then the resulting section is the surface bounded by the equations $y^2+(z+1)^2=2-(z-1)^2$ and $y^2+z^2=x^2$ . Solving this system of equations on $(y,z)$ we deduce that the solution exists for $0\leq x \leq 2$ and for each such $x$ there are exactly two solutions: $(-\sqrt{2x^3-x^4},x-x^2),(\sqrt{2x^3-x^4},x-x^2)$ . Therefore, for a fixed $x \in [0,2]$ we have that $y \in [-\sqrt{2x^3-x^4},\sqrt{2x^3-x^4}]$ as the intersetion points of the circunferences are the extreme possible values for the $y$ . Then, be must set the integration limits for $z$ : it's easy to see that $z \in [-\sqrt{x^2-y^2},-1+\sqrt{2-(x-1)^2-y^2}]$ as it's bounded below by the cone and bounded above by the sphere. On the other hand, for $x \in [2,1+\sqrt{2}]$ we have no intersections in the transversal sections. Therefore, the circle corresponding to a cut of the sphere is completely inside the cut corresponding the cone. Therefore, in this case we have to integrate for each $x$ a circle of radius $\sqrt{2-(x-1)^2}$ . Summing it all up, we conclude that $$ m_3(A) = \int_0^{2} dx \int_{-\sqrt{2x^3-x^4}}^{\sqrt{2x^3-x^4}}dy \int_{-\sqrt{x^2-y^2}}^{-1+\sqrt{2-(x-1)^2-y^2}} dz + \int_2^{1+\sqrt{2}} dx \pi (2-(x-1)^2) $$ I can't find any incongruence with my reasoning and my (limited) geometric intuition makes me think I'm correct.

I suspect the problem is my thought about X, maybe X is not [0,1)?","T:X\to X T(x)=2x\;(mod\;1) \alpha=\{[0,\frac{1}{2}),[\frac{1}{2},1)\} \lor_{i=0}^{n-1}T^{-i}\alpha=\{[\frac{i}{2^n},\frac{i+1}{2^n})\,:i=0,...2^n-1\} \alpha \alpha \lor_{i=0}^{\infty}T^{-i}\alpha \sigma \sigma \alpha","['measure-theory', 'dynamical-systems', 'entropy', 'ergodic-theory']"
