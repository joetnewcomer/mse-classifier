The parabolas share a vertex, that is one of the designated points, and a line of symmetry. Each parabola passes through two more of the designated points on the circle. One of the parabolas is degenerate and looks like a line segment. Assume that, for every value of $n$ , the average (arithmetic mean) area of the $4n$ regions is exactly $6$ . Find $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}(\text{product of areas})$ . I have worked out that the answer is $L^2$ where $L$ is the limit shown above. So I am looking for a closed form of $L$ . If the average area is $5.999$ the product approaches $0$ ; if the average area is $6.001$ the product diverges. I have tested my expression for $P_{n}$ with some small values of $n$ , and I think it is correct. This question was inspired by other questions about the product of areas in a circle, such as this , this and this .

The problem is to prove that if $\lim_{|x|\to\infty} f'(x)\cdot x=0$ then $g$ is bounded. My idea is to show that $\lim_{|x|\to\infty}|g(x) |=0$. (If that limit is valid, then there exists $K_1>0$ such that $|x|>K_1\Rightarrow|g(x) |<1$. Furthermore, as $|g|$ is continuous and $B[0,K_1]$ is compact, there exists $K_2>0$ such that $|g(x) |\leq K_2$ for all $x\in B[0,K_1 ]$. So, $|g(x) |\leq \max\{1,K_2\}$ for all $x\in\mathbb R^m$).

So, taking the limit with $n\to\infty$, we get $$\lim_{n\to\infty}|g(x_n )|=0$$ which implies the desired result. The above solution does not work to arbitrary $m$ because, for $m\neq 1$, $x_n$ and $c_n$ are not scalars and thus the equality in $(1)$ is not valid. So, I need help to treat the general case.

The problem is to prove that if $\lim_{|x|\to\infty} f'(x)\cdot x=0$ then $g$ is bounded. My idea is to show that $\lim_{|x|\to\infty}|g(x) |=0$. (If that limit is valid, then there exists $K_1>0$ such that $|x|>K_1\Rightarrow|g(x) |<1$. Furthermore, as $|g|$ is continuous and $B[0,K_1]$ is compact, there exists $K_2>0$ such that $|g(x) |\leq K_2$ for all $x\in B[0,K_1 ]$. So, $|g(x) |\leq \max\{1,K_2\}$ for all $x\in\mathbb R^m$). For $m=1$, I've done the following. Let $(x_n )\subset\mathbb R$ be a sequence such that $\lim_{n\to\infty }|x_n |=\infty$. By the Mean Value Theorem, for each $n\in\mathbb N$ there exists $c_n$ between $x_n$ e $2x_n$ such that $$0\leq|g(x_n)|=|f(2x_n)-f(x_n)|\leq|f'(c_n)\cdot x_n|=\frac{|x_n|}{|c_n|}|f'(c_n)\cdot c_n|\leq 1\cdot|f'(c_n)\cdot c_n|.\tag{1}$$ Notice that $\lim_{n\to\infty}|c_n |=\infty$. So, taking the limit with $n\to\infty$, we get $$\lim_{n\to\infty}|g(x_n )|=0$$ which implies the desired result. The above solution does not work to arbitrary $m$ because, for $m\neq 1$, $x_n$ and $c_n$ are not scalars and thus the equality in $(1)$ is not valid. So, I need help to treat the general case.

By plugging in large values for $n$ , I noticed that the limit is most likely $\frac{2}{3}$ , but I can't prove it. Update Over a year has passed since I asked this question, but recently it was closed out of the blue because it lacks additional context. So let me explain where this limit comes from. I was studying the following problem: Let's consider a sequence of random numbers. Each number is uniformly distributed between $0$ and $1$ . We add up the terms of this sequence one by one until their sum exceeds a certain number $x \in \mathbb{R}$ . Let $E_x$ be the expected number of terms needed for that. The original question asked for the value of $E_1$ , which turns out to be $e$ . After I solved this by using differential equations, I wanted to find a formula for all $E_x$ . Before I had found one, I thought: ""Well, each term of the sequence increases the sum by an expected value of $\frac{1}{2}$ , so the sum should exceed $x$ after roughly $2x$ "" terms. For large $x$ , this approximation should get better and $E_x$ will get closer and closer to $2x$ ."" In other words, I thought that $\lim\limits_{x \to \infty}\left(E_x-2x\right)=0$ . This turned out to be wrong later. Finding a nice formula for $E_x$ is not easy and the only explicit formula I could come up with was a piecewise-defined function with infinitely many pieces. The first piece ranges from $0$ to $1$ , the second from $1$ to $2$ , the third from $2$ to $3$ , and so on.

By plugging in large values for , I noticed that the limit is most likely , but I can't prove it. Update Over a year has passed since I asked this question, but recently it was closed out of the blue because it lacks additional context. So let me explain where this limit comes from. I was studying the following problem: Let's consider a sequence of random numbers. Each number is uniformly distributed between and . We add up the terms of this sequence one by one until their sum exceeds a certain number . Let be the expected number of terms needed for that. The original question asked for the value of , which turns out to be . After I solved this by using differential equations, I wanted to find a formula for all . Before I had found one, I thought: ""Well, each term of the sequence increases the sum by an expected value of , so the sum should exceed after roughly "" terms. For large , this approximation should get better and will get closer and closer to ."" In other words, I thought that . This turned out to be wrong later.
