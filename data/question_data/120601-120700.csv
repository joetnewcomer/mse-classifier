I keep finding these hand-rules as an explanation whereas I'd have to like something which actually gives me a motivation for the definition and also gives me a more mathematical definition.

I'd like to actually understand what right-handed means, like what are the implications of it and also be able to determine if 2 given vectors in a 3D space are making up a left or right-handed system. Could someone explain it to me, without using one of the many hand rules? That's something one can do when I actually understood the basic concept, which I don't at the moment.

1,9-10th grade olympiad problem,9-10th grade olympiad problem,,"So first things first, I apologize for my bad English in advance. In one math olympiad (for 9-10th grade) there was a problem: There is given a rectangle $ ABCD $ such that $AB=1$ and $BC=2$. There is a point $P$ on diagonal $BD$ and a point $Q$ on $BC$. Find the lowest possible value of $CP+PQ$. So what I tried to do was to  prove that only if PQ $\bot$ BC we get the least possible value of PQ. Therefore, we get right-angled $\bigtriangleup CPQ$, where $\angle CQP=90°$. By using Pythagorean theorem, we get that $CP+PQ=\sqrt{CQ^2+PQ^2}+PQ$. I tried to find out if there is any dependence on CQ and PQ. Apparently, there is, such that $PQ=\frac{2-CQ}{2}$. I tried to write that in $\sqrt{CQ^2+PQ^2}+PQ$ and what I got was $\sqrt{1,25CQ^2-CQ+1}+1-\frac{CQ}{2}$. What I did next was one of the dumbest decisions I could have possibly made there. Since I didn't know how to calculate the minimum value of this expression of $CP+PQ$, I tried to make $\sqrt{1,25CQ^2-CQ+1}=1$, which was pretty logical (so we would get a rational answer), but absolutely not proved. So from this equation I got that $CQ=\frac{4}{5}$ and so $CP+PQ=\sqrt{1,25CQ^2-CQ+1}+1-\frac{CQ}{2}=1,6$ (by the way, $1,6$ IS the correct answer). So what I wanted to ask you was, is there any smart way to find the minimum value of $\sqrt{1,25CQ^2-CQ+1}+1-\frac{CQ}{2}$ (this is basically all I needed to get full 7 points for this problem).","So first things first, I apologize for my bad English in advance.

7,How to adjust spaceship's speed?,How to adjust spaceship's speed?,,"A spaceship is moving through 2-dimensional space by a series of jumps. Each jump consists of rotating right and flying forward.

Is there only one solution? Ship may turn left or right, but this decision must be made before starting flying, later it always turns the same way each jump.

Notes to clarify more on $\mathcal{D}$: We only have the numbers in $\mathcal{D}$, we do not know which number corresponds to the distance of which two points. The maximum distance in $\mathcal{D}$ is always $2a$, which is the distance between the extremes $x_1$ and $x_n$. For each point $x_i, i \in \{2,..,n-1\}$, there will exist two numbers in $\mathcal{D}$ which will add up to $2a$, those are the distances from this point to the extremes. The cardinality of $\mathcal{D}$ is always $^nC_2$, which means that all distances between the points are distinct. Suppose that we could find a placement (the values) for the points $x_2, \ldots, x_{n-1}$ for which the interdistances form the set $\mathcal{D}$, it is obvious that $-x_2, \ldots, -x_{n-1}$ will result in the same set $\mathcal{D}$.

I'll then resave that file under each individual star's name, turn off all the other stars, and then draw a line segment connecting different cube edges and then slide its end points along the edge until the line intersects the center of the star. These lines are what will ultimately become the wires connecting the star to the frame edges in the final sculpture, and I generally find 2-5 possible solutions for each star. Here's an example of my found brute-force'd solutions for a star in Aquarius to illustrate (the red point is my marker to keep myself oriented): sadachiba What I want to know is, how can I SOLVE for these lines, either algebraically or numerically? While the process can be pretty meditative and relaxing sometimes, I am getting pretty tired of brute forcing all these solutions by hand in Geogebra, especially since it is difficult to get the line segment precisely through the plotted point by scooting around its end points (not to mention this just propogates my errors in the final, physical form, so no bueno), and because I know that I'm probably missing some of the possible solutions sometimes (and I want all the solutions for each star so I can have some wire position options for aesthetic reasons and to make sure no wires pass in front of other stars when viewed head-on). I had talked out the problem with some of my most trusted physics classmates and one of my physics professors last summer, but if memory serves, none of us ever came up with a solution, or in the very least I never found anything that worked. (Which is weird, because this seemed like it should be pretty easy to me, and honestly it still does.) I think I had tried some failed way involving determinants as one of my attempts, but I don't remember what it was and Lord knows what sketchbook that was in. At no point was there an attempt by any party to try and solve the problem numerically, but I've taken numerical analysis since then, so that option is now comfortably on the table for me if need be. So, what I'm working with here, essentially: Seven knowns, and two unknowns. The known (x,y,z) coordinates for the star Two known coordinates (with values of either -100 or 100, depending on which cube edge) and one unknown coordinate (the position along the length of that cube edge) for the first wire anchor Two known coordinates and one unknown coordinate for the second wire anchor on another cube edge What I want: a straightforward formula (or algorithm) for computing those two unknowns.

44,Formal definition of trigonometric functions,Formal definition of trigonometric functions,,"I want to define trigonometric function (say sine) formally with the definition that the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. But there is a problem with defining an angle (and the measure of an angle) without knowing trigonometric functions. Some people say that the measure of an angle is the ratio of the lenth of the arc to the lenght of the radius. But I don't know how to define an arc without trigonometric functions. The solution may be to define sine and cosine with power series. I know this approach and it's fine, but I'm interested in classical definition. So I came up with my own idea. Let $x\in (0,90)$ and let $P$ be a model of Hilbert's plane euclidian geometry, $\mu$ is segments measure, $\nu$ is angles measure such that the emasure of the right angle is $90$, and $\triangle abc$ is a right triangle in which $\nu(\angle abc)=x$. Then $\sin x=\frac{\mu(ac)}{\mu(ab)}$. This definition requires proving many theorems (for instance existance of measures and triangle with given angles) and you have to prove that the definition doesn't depnd on the choice of the model, choice of the segments measure and choice of the right triangle. The question is: Can we define angles and sine without referring to Hilbert' theory? Maybe it's possible to define measure of angles in euclidian model $\mathbb{R}^2$. I think the key part of the definition must be additivity of the measure, as it is in Hilbert's theory.","I want to define trigonometric function (say sine) formally with the definition that the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. But there is a problem with defining an angle (and the measure of an angle) without knowing trigonometric functions. Some people say that the measure of an angle is the ratio of the lenth of the arc to the lenght of the radius. But I don't know how to define an arc without trigonometric functions. The solution may be to define sine and cosine with power series. I know this approach and it's fine, but I'm interested in classical definition. So I came up with my own idea. Let $x\in (0,90)$ and let $P$ be a model of Hilbert's plane euclidian geometry, $\mu$ is segments measure, $\nu$ is angles measure such that the emasure of the right angle is $90$, and $\triangle abc$ is a right triangle in which $\nu(\angle abc)=x$. Then $\sin x=\frac{\mu(ac)}{\mu(ab)}$. This definition requires proving many theorems (for instance existance of measures and triangle with given angles) and you have to prove that the definition doesn't depnd on the choice of the model, choice of the segments measure and choice of the right triangle.

Objects do not visibly appear distorted when moving through the space, but everything in the room is small enough to have been brought in through the door (let's say vehicle-garage-size). This room is however not particularly useful, because despite its apparent size, you can't put very much in it - the storage capacity of the room is still limited by the containing building: the volume within the room is no greater than the volume of any other floor of the building with an equivalent external footprint. Trying to put more objects into the room than would fit into a conventional space will result in Bad Things™ happening (certainly not anything a protagonist would want to experience first-hand). the mass that can be contained within the room is limited by the supporting structure of the building, the same as on any other floor.

86,Geometric definitions of infinity,Geometric definitions of infinity,,"There are several definitions of ""infinite set"" that are common in set theory.  For instance, a set $S$ is finite if there is a bijection between a natural number $n$ and $S$; it is infinite otherwise.  Alternatively, one can define a set $S$ to be infinite if there is an injection from the natural numbers into it.  Alternatively, there is the definition of ""Dedekind infinite"" sets, i.e., those for which there is an injection into a proper subset of themselves.  All of these definitions can be shown to be equivalent under suitable assumptions (e.g., some require choice). All of these definitions, however, are set-theoretic in character, in that they rely on the set-theoretic definition of function, injection, etc.  They also characterize what it means for a set to contain infinitely many objects, rather than for a space to be infinitely divisible or infinite in extension. Two of the definitions require appeal to the natural numbers and so have a bit of an ""arithmetic"" flavor.  Here's my question:  are there well-known, precise  ""geometric"" definitions of what it means for space to be infinite?  Of course, it depends what one counts as ""geometric"", and so I realize this question is vague.  But I am interested in whether there definitions that rely less on set theoretic properties of functions and the natural numbers, and more on properties of ""space"" in some sense. Of course, there are order-theoretic conditions that might be used to characterize infinite spaces (e.g., density and unboundedness entail a space is infinite in a sense).  Any other ideas? Edit: MVG's suggestion is really helpful.  It's true I wasn't clear whether I wanted a purely ""geometric"" definition of a space (i) containing infinitely many points, (ii) having infinite measure, or (iii) containing a subspace that extends infinitely in some direction (e.g., a ray in the plane).  MVG suggests ""geometric"" definitions of a space that contains infinitely many points.  So here's perhaps a more precise question that I can ask now about  how to use geometric concepts to define subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^n$ having infinite measure, or that contain sets that extend infinitely in some direction. For example, say a subset $S$ of a plane is ""infinite"" if it has the following properties:  1.  $S$ contains either a circle or square.  2. Every circle in $S$ is circumscribed by a square lying in $S$.  3. Every square in $S$ is circumscribed by a circle lying in $S$.  4. The interior of any square in $S$ lies in $S$. Then $S$ is the entire plane, I think, as you can get a nested sequence of circles of arbitrarily large radius.  A similar definition should work in higher definitions.  So it seems, perhaps by cheating, that we've characterized what it would mean for section of a plane to be unbounded or infinite in every direction using only figures that can be constructed via straight-edges and compass. Of course, my definition wouldn't pick out the upper-right quadrant of the plane as being ""infinite"" (as a square with vertex at the origin could not be inscribed in a circle lying in the quadrant), but I think we can modify my definition slightly to fix it (e.g., by inscribing squares in quarter circles and vice versa).  In general, does something similar work for all convex subsets of the plane? So perhaps here's the more precise question. Problem:  Let $S$ be a convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$.  Find a collection of conditions/sentences $C$ such that (i) $C$ mentions only figures that are constructible via by standard constraints (e.g., in the plane, straight-edge and compass in the plane) and (ii) $S$ satisfies $C$ if and only if the Lebesgue measure of $S$ is infinite, or $S$ contains some subset $T$ that has infinite Lebesgue measure of lower dimension.","There are several definitions of ""infinite set"" that are common in set theory.

If we truncate at the midpoint of each edge for all vertices of each Platonic solid, we get its dual polyhedron. So, for the tetrahedron, truncating it in this manner results in another tetrahedron. When you truncate the cube and the octahedron, you get the other Platonic solid. Finally, the same goes for the icosahedron and dodecahedron. Since I am having difficulty envisioning the actual results, I was wondering if you guys could help me out. Also, is there a program I can use to manually do this operation? Thanks!","Let $P$ denote a Platonic solid.

96,Smallest Convex Hulls ($n$-Simplex) of $n+2$ Points in $\mathbb{R}^n$,Smallest Convex Hulls (-Simplex) of  Points in,n n+2 \mathbb{R}^n,"""Given $n$, find the minimal value of $k$ with the following property: Any $k$ (distinct) points in $\mathbb{R}^n$ can be partitioned into two disjoint subsets so that the intersection of the convex hulls of the two partitions is not empty."" A convex hull of a set is the ""smallest"" convex set which contains the set. A convex set $C$ is one in which $\forall x,y \in C$, $\lambda x + (1-\lambda)y \in C$ for $0 \leq \lambda \leq 1$. For instance, in $\mathbb{R}$, suppose we have three points, $a,b,c$ with $a < b < c$. Then let $a$ and $c$ be in one partition and $b$ in the other. Clearly, the convex hull of $\{a,c\}$ is the line segment which indeed passes $b$. In $\mathbb{R}^2$, I think $k=4$. We have four cases: Case 1: All four points $a,b,c,d$ are collinear. Then the partitions can be $\{a,c\}$ and $\{b,d\}$ and their convex hulls clearly have non empty intersection. Case 2: Three of the points are collinear, say $a,b,c,$ with $b$ between $a$ and $c$. Point $d$ is elsewhere. Then let the partitions again be $\{a,c\}$ and $\{b,d\}$. Case 3: The four points form the vertices of a convex quadrilateral. Then let the convex hulls be the ""diagonals"". Case 4: The four points form the vertices of a concave quadrilateral. Then three of the points form the vertices of a triangle and the fourth point would be inside that. The convex hull of $\{a,b,c\}$ is exactly that triangle. I conjecture that $k=n+2$. I think that the convex hull of $n+1$ points in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is the $n$-simplex (I don't know if that's the right notation). We can always form a simplex with $n+1$ points and then have the last point be floating around. If that point is within the simplex (conjectured convex hull), then we are done. If it's outside it, we can sort of divide up the space based on the ""faces"" of our simplex. For instance, in $\mathbb{R}^3$, we have five points. We can build a tetrahedron with four of the points. The tetrahedron will have four faces which can be extended to be four planes, dividing up the $\mathbb{R}^3$. Each plane cuts the space into two. So if our fifth point is on one side of the face, then there is an associated vertex of the tetrahedron on the other side. We can let that vertex and this fifth point be in a partition and the other three points in the other. Thus, we have a line segment passing through a triangle. If there's problems with the point being in the plane of one of the faces, I think we can still account for that case simply by forming a triangle and line segment. But beyond $\mathbb{R}^n$, it isn't obvious to me how to prove or disprove the conjecture. I think the solution shouldn't require anything but rather elementary (not necessarily easy or simple, just techniques that a undergraduate or even high school student might recognize) methods. I don't actually know any algebraic geometry but I know that simplices and affine geometry has something to do with the problem; hence the tags. Any ideas for solving this problem are welcome and appreciated.","""Given $n$, find the minimal value of $k$ with the following property: Any $k$ (distinct) points in $\mathbb{R}^n$ can be partitioned into two disjoint subsets so that the intersection of the convex hulls of the two partitions is not empty.""
