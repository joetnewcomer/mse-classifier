0,Definition of a Basis for a Topology - Intersection of Basis Elements and Possibility of being a Topology,Definition of a Basis for a Topology - Intersection of Basis Elements and Possibility of being a Topology,,"Part of the definition of a basis for a topology for a set $X$ states: If $x$ belongs to the intersection of two basis elements $B_1$ and $B_2$ , then there is a basis element $B_3$ containing $x$ such that $B_3 \subset B_1 \cap B_2$ . I would like to clarify that this definition does not rule out the possibility that $B_3=B_2$ or $B_3=B_1$ . Because applying this definition to, for instance, $B_1$ and $B_3$ we should find a set $B_4$ containing $x$ such that $B_4 \subset B_1 \cap B_3$ . I have another question about basis.

I.e. extensionaly or intensionaly? In the form $S=\{x\in\mathbb{N}|\phi(x)\}$ (intensionaly)? Because I think that that recursively defining a set S implies a intensional definition of a subset of the superset of $S$ (The subset is $S$ ) in this case it is $\mathbb{N}$ . (Reasonably the set can also be written extensionally $S=\{1,3,5,....\}$ but this is not the point of my question I am interested in the implicit  intensional definition given by the recursion) I have made a previous example with propositional formulas in a language, A language consists of an ALPHABET and a GRAMMAR. An alphabet $\mathcal{A}$ is a union of three different sets, we will call the element of an alphabet symbols. The first set are the symbols for the propositional variables like $A,B,C....$ , the second set is the set of logical symbols $T,F,\wedge,\vee,\implies,\iff$ and the third set are non-logical symbols like $(,)$ The set of all propositional formulas  is similair to the set $S$ above because there are some initial elements and some elements we can derive from the initial elements recursively. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be the set of all propositional formulas. We want   to define this set in such a way if we take a element from   it: $\phi\in\mathcal{F}$ then we want to say that this is equivalent   to the desired statement : $\phi\in \{1\}\times V\vee \exists!  \psi_1,\psi_2\in\mathcal{F},a\in\{\vee,\implies,\wedge,\iff\}: \phi=(a,\psi_1,\psi_2)$ . $V$ is the set of all propositional variables   we have defined extensionaly in beforehand: $V=\{A,B,C,D,E,...\}$ . For the sake of simplicity I have just looked at the set of binary operators but one can also do the same for other operators and also can use another symbols like $\{1,2,3,4\}$ . The important thing is that we can distinguish in this case the triples from one another. I have simplified even further and assumed in the following that $\implies$ is the only logical operator we have to consider and which happens to be a binary logical operator. $$\mathcal{F}=\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N_0}}T_n$$ $$T_0= \{1\}\times V\quad\text{and}\quad T_n=\bigcup_{(j,k)\in\{1,...,n-1\}^{2}}\{2\}\times T_{n-1}\times T_j\cup \{2\}\times T_k\times T_{n-1}$$ My question is first of all whether my definition of $\mathcal{F}$ makes sense, i.e. whether I actually have defined all propositional   formulas? Whether there is alternative that is so general that it does not make   use of the natural numbers because this definition was motivated by   someone elses answer to an old question of mine and I am not sure if   his understanding of $\mathcal{F}$ matches my definition and   unfortunately this person does not react to my comment anymore (link   to the question: Induction over propositional formulas ).   And he seems to make no use of natural numbers. He explicitly said structural induction and not induction over the natural numbers. Whether taking an element from this defined set is equivalent to the desired statement and how I can prove it, especialy the uniqueness. Finally I want to ask whether I can somehow derive a general   definition of all inductively defined sets from this example.

R. Halmos, Naive Set Theory (p. 28) EDIT: Taking the answers I've received thus far, here's what I'm currently working with. Let $X$ be a set, and let $R$ be an equivalence relation in $X$ . Then $x/R$ (or $[x]$ if you prefer) is a set comprising the elements $y$ such that $(x, y) \in R$ . Each such equivalence class for each element $x \in X$ is a subset of $X$ and therefore a member of $\mathscr P(X)$ . This in turn means that $X/R$ , the set of all $x/R$ for our given $X$ and our given equivalence $R$ , is a set of subsets of $X$ , making it a subset of $\mathscr P(X)$ . Now, I've worked through two examples: If we let $X = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ and let $R$ be the relation of equality in $X$ , then $X/R = \{\{1\}, \{2\}, \{3\}, \{4\}\}$ . This is a subset of $\mathscr P(X)$ as expected. If we let $X = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and let $R$ be the cartesian product $X \times X$ , then $X/R = \{\{1, 2, 3\}\}$ , which is a subset of $\mathscr P(X)$ as expected. As for how one can come up with a general specification that achieves both of these results: $$X/R = \{S \in \mathscr P(X): (s \in S) \iff ([t \in S] \land [s \space R \space t]) \}$$ Or, in English, the set of equivalence classes in $X$ with respect to a given relation $R$ is the set of all sets $S$ in the power set of $X$ for which an element $s$ is only in $S$ if there is also $t$ in $S$ and $s$ and $t$ stand in equivalence to one another.

56,Why is the definition of inductive set well defined?,Why is the definition of inductive set well defined?,,"I've been studying from Enderton's Mathematical Introduction to Logic in which he defines an inductive set as follows: To simplify our discussion, we will consider an initial set $B \subseteq U$ and a class $F$ of functions containing just two members $f$ and $g$ , where $f:U×U→U$ and $g:U→U$ .   Thus $f$ is a binary operation on $U$ and $g$ is a unary operation. (Actually $F$ need not be finite; it will be seen that our simplified discussion here is, in fact, applicable to a more general situation. $F$ can be any set of relations on $U$ , and in Chapter 2 this greater generality will be utilized. But the case discussed here is easier to visualize and is general enough to illustrate the ideas. For a less restricted version, see Exercise 3.)   If $B$ contains points $a$ and $b$ , then the set $C$ we wish to construct will contain, for example, $b, f (b, b), g(a), f (g(a), f (b, b)), g( f (g(a), f (b, b)))$ .   Of course these might not all be distinct. The idea is that we are given certain bricks to work with, and certain types of mortar, and we want $C$ to contain just the things we are able to build. In defining $C$ more formally, we have our choice of two definitions. We can define it “from the top down” as follows: Say that a subset $S$ of $U$ is closed under $f$ and $g$ iff whenever elements $x$ and y belong to $S$ , then so also do $f(x,y)$ and $g(x)$ .Say that $S$ is inductive iff $B \subseteq S$ and $S$ is closed under $f$ and $g$ . Let $C^*$ be the intersection of all the inductive subsets of $U$ ; thus $x \in C^*$ iff $x$ belongs to every inductive subset of $U$ . It is not hard to see (and the reader should check) that $C^*$ is itself inductive. Furthermore, $C^*$ is the smallest such set, being included in all the other inductive sets. The second (and equivalent) definition works “from the bottom up.” We want $C_*$ to contain the things that can be reached from $B$ by applying $f$ and $g$ a finite number of times. Temporarily define a construction sequence to be a finite sequence $<x_1, . . . , x_n>$ of elements of $U$ such that   for each $i \leq n$ we have at least one of $x_i \in B$ , $x_i=f(x_j,x_k)$ for some $j<i,k<i$ , $x_i =g(x_j)$ for   some $j<i$ . In other words, each member of the sequence either is in B or results from earlier members by applying f or g. Then let C be the set of all points x such that some construction sequence ends with x. I am confused as in other texts I've read an inductive set to be defined in a similar fashion to as follows from Enderton's Elements of Set Theory : A set $A$ is said to be inductive iff $\emptyset \in A$ and it is ""closed under successor,"" i.e., $(\forall a \in A) a^+ \in a$ or similarly for For Natural Numbers What confuses me most is that by just defining an inductive set as such "" $S$ is inductive iff $B \subseteq S$ and $S$ is closed under $f$ and $g$ "" doesnt that lead to inductive sets such as $\{1,2,3,4\}$ where $f$ and $g$ can be sent to map all to the same element $1$ .

Assume not, that is there is an element of $M$ such that it is not comparable, so define $$M'=M\cup\left\{(a,b)\right\}$$ We need to show $M'$ is a partially ordered, so we need to check: $i)$ $(x,x)\not\in M'$ for any $x\in M'$ . Proof of i). Since $(x,x)\not\in \left\{(a,b)\right\}$ and $(x,x)\not\in M$ because $M$ is a partially order, hence $(x,x)\not\in M'$ for any $x\in M'$ . $ii)$ if $(x,y)\in M'$ and $(y,x)\in M'$ for all $x,y\in M'$ , then $x=y$ .

85,Evaluating correctness of various definitions of countable sets,Evaluating correctness of various definitions of countable sets,,"I was trying to understand the definition of countable set (again!!!). Wikipedia has a very great explanation : A set $S$ is countable if there exists an $\color{red}{\text{injective}}$ function $f$ from $S$ to the natural numbers $\mathbb N$. If such an $f$ can be found that is also $\color{red}{\text{surjective}}$ (and therefore bijective), then $S$ is called countably infinite . In other words, a set is countably infinite if it has $\color{red}{\text{bijection}}$ with the $\mathbb N$. So I summarize: $S$ is countable iff $S\xrightarrow{injection}\mathbb N$ $S$ is countably infinite iff $S\xrightarrow{bijection}\mathbb N$ But then wikipedia confuses by stating following points: Theorem: Let $S$ be a set. The following statements are equivalent: $S$ is countable, i.e. there exists an injective function $f : S → \mathbb N$. Either $S$ is empty or there exists a surjective function $g : \mathbb N → S$. Either $S$ is finite or there exists a bijection $h : \mathbb N → S$. Q1. I feel 2nd statement is wrong, as it allows some element in $S$ to not to map to any element in $\mathbb N$. That is $\mathbb N \xrightarrow{surjection} S$ does not imply $S\xrightarrow{injection}\mathbb N$. Hence $S$ is not countable. Right? Q2. 3rd  statement defines countably infinite set, so its countable also. Right? Q3. Also I dont get if the extra restrictions of emptyness and finiteness in statements 2 and 3 are required. Wikipedia further says: Corollary: Let $S$ and $T$ be sets. If the function $f : S → T$ is injective and $T$ is countable then $S$ is countable. If the function $g : S → T$ is surjective and $S$ is countable then $T$ is countable. Q4. Here, too, I feel 2nd statement is incorrect for the same reason as 2nd statement in the theorem. Right? Edit I dont know if its correct to add this edit. But its the source of my confusion. So adding it anyway. All answers on this post go on explaining how sujectivity and injectivity imply each other and hence bijectivity. But does that means, whenever injective $f:X\rightarrow Y$ exists, there also  holds surjective $g:Y\rightarrow X$ (and also a bijective)? I dont feel so, as the wikipedia gives examples of injective $f:X\rightarrow Y$, for which $g:Y\rightarrow X$ is not surjective: On the same page, it gives example of surjective $g:Y\rightarrow X$, for which $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is not injective: How can I reconcile these facts with given answers? I must be missing something very basic!!!","I was trying to understand the definition of countable set (again!!!). Wikipedia has a very great explanation : A set $S$ is countable if there exists an $\color{red}{\text{injective}}$ function $f$ from $S$ to the natural numbers $\mathbb N$. If such an $f$ can be found that is also $\color{red}{\text{surjective}}$ (and therefore bijective), then $S$ is called countably infinite . In other words, a set is countably infinite if it has $\color{red}{\text{bijection}}$ with the $\mathbb N$. So I summarize: $S$ is countable iff $S\xrightarrow{injection}\mathbb N$ $S$ is countably infinite iff $S\xrightarrow{bijection}\mathbb N$ But then wikipedia confuses by stating following points: Theorem: Let $S$ be a set. The following statements are equivalent: $S$ is countable, i.e. there exists an injective function $f : S → \mathbb N$. Either $S$ is empty or there exists a surjective function $g : \mathbb N → S$. Either $S$ is finite or there exists a bijection $h : \mathbb N → S$. Q1. I feel 2nd statement is wrong, as it allows some element in $S$ to not to map to any element in $\mathbb N$. That is $\mathbb N \xrightarrow{surjection} S$ does not imply $S\xrightarrow{injection}\mathbb N$. Hence $S$ is not countable. Right? Q2. 3rd  statement defines countably infinite set, so its countable also. Right? Q3. Also I dont get if the extra restrictions of emptyness and finiteness in statements 2 and 3 are required. Wikipedia further says: Corollary: Let $S$ and $T$ be sets. If the function $f : S → T$ is injective and $T$ is countable then $S$ is countable. If the function $g : S → T$ is surjective and $S$ is countable then $T$ is countable. Q4. Here, too, I feel 2nd statement is incorrect for the same reason as 2nd statement in the theorem. Right? Edit I dont know if its correct to add this edit. But its the source of my confusion. So adding it anyway.
