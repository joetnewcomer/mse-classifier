6,Sum of cube roots of complex conjugates,Sum of cube roots of complex conjugates,,"When solving the following cubic equation: $$x^3 - 15x - 4 = 0$$ I got one of the solutions: $$x = \sqrt[3]{2 {\color{red}+} 11i} + \sqrt[3]{2 {\color{red}-} 11i}$$ When I calculated it with a hand calculator, it turned out to be exactly $4$. And indeed, when I substitute $x=4$ into the original equation, it is a solution. So this appears to be true: $$\sqrt[3]{2 {\color{red}+} 11i} + \sqrt[3]{2 {\color{red}-} 11i} = 4$$ So we have a sum of cube roots of complex numbers which nevertheless happens to produce a real result. So I presume that these two cube roots must be complex conjugates of each other, which seems to be the case, judging by the fact that the numbers under the cube roots are complex conjugates of each other as well (note the signs I marked with red). Complex conjugates are ""mirror images"" of each other, so when added up, they produce a real result. Cube roots of complex conjugates divide their angles by 3, so the results should remain complex conjugates, and I suppose this is the reason why they add up to a real number as well. Am I right? What bothers me, though, is how can we PROVE that identity with algebra?

9,Finding maxima of a function $f(x) = \sqrt{x} - 2x^2$ without calculus,Finding maxima of a function  without calculus,f(x) = \sqrt{x} - 2x^2,"My question is how to prove that $f(x) = \sqrt x - 2x^2$ has its maximum at point $x_0 = \frac{1}{4}$ It is easy to do that by finding its derivative and setting it to be zero (this is how I got $x_0 = \frac{1}{4}$ ). But the task is to do that without using any calculus tools and I`m stuck at it. My idea was to introduce $t = \sqrt x$ to get $f(t) = t - 2t^4$ and then find its maximum because I know how to do that with parabola which can be transformed to $a(x-x_0)^2 + y_0$ . So I was trying to turn $f(t) = t - 2t^4$ into $f(t) = a(x-x_0)^4 + y_0$ but it seems impossible. My second thought was to use the definition of rising function on an interval so I supposed we have $a, b \in \left(0; \frac{1}{4}\right) \text{and } a < b$ . Then I prove that $$\sqrt a - 2a^2 < \sqrt b - 2b^2$$ $$2(b - a)(a + b) < \sqrt b - \sqrt a$$ $$ 2(\sqrt a + \sqrt b)(a + b) < 1$$ which is true since $0 < a < b < \frac{1}{4}$ Exactly the same way I prove that for every $a, b \in \left(\frac{1}{4}; +\infty\right) \text{and } a < b$ $$\sqrt a - 2a^2 > \sqrt b - 2b^2$$ So we have that $f(x)$ is rising on $\left(0; \frac{1}{4}\right)$ and declining on $\left(\frac{1}{4}; +\infty\right)$ , consequently at $\frac{1}{4}$ we have a maximum of $f$ But I guess it is not fair to use derivatives to find the maximum and then simply prove that this value is correct. Is there an even better solution? What are your thoughts about my proof? UPD: there are a lot of solutions which are formally OK but first we have to guess $x_0 = \frac{1}{4}$ or $y_0 = \frac{3}{8}$ .

10,How to average cyclic quantities?,How to average cyclic quantities?,,"Looking on Internet, I mostly found this definition: Given quantities on a cyclic domain D, first rescale the domain to [0;2$\pi$[, then, find $z_n$ the point on the unit circle corresponding to the $n$th value, and compute the average by: $$z_m = \sum_{n=1}^N z_n$$ The average angle is then $\theta_m = \arg z_m$ and to obtain the average value you scale back to your original domain D.

20,Understanding the slope of a line as a rate of change,Understanding the slope of a line as a rate of change,,"I thought I was confident about what is meant by the slope of a line and how it relates to a rate of change , but I'm having doubts and I'm hoping that someone will be able to help me clear them up. As I understand it, intuitively the slope of a line is a number $m$ that quantifies the amount it inclines from the horizontal, and its direction.

Wolf's, Proof, Logic and Conjecture . At the end of the first chapter there are some exercises to warm you up for the proof techniques he will eventually introduce. I only mention this so that you are aware that I have yet to encounter formal proof techniques. The first part of the question simply asks you to substitute small values of $n$ into the expression $n^2-n+41$ and to test if these values are prime. I did this for $n=1$ to $12$ , and all the values seemed prime. This leads me onto the second part of the question where I am stuck. I'll paraphrase the question: (1)(b) Find a positive integer value of $n$ for which the expression $n^2-n+41$ is not a prime number. My attempt I will decompose the expression $n^2-n+41$ into symbolic and numeric parts i.e. $n^2-n$ and $41$ , in order to obtain a better understanding of it. The symbolic part of the expression $n^2-n$ can be factorised to $n(n-1)$ . From this it is apparent that this portion of the expression will only ever return even values, because it will always be of the form where we have an odd number multiplied by an even number. For example: for $n=5$ , an odd number, we have $5(5-1)=5(4)=20$ ; similarly for $n=4$ , an even number, we have $4(4-1)=4(3)=12$ . The addition of an odd number and even number returns an odd number, thus the addition of $41$ (an odd number) to $n^2-n$ (an expression which always returns even numbers) will give an odd number for all integer values of $n$ . As $n^2-n+41$ always returns odd numbers, it then stands to reason that if we are to find any non-prime value of this expression it will also be odd. The only way I could think of doing this was by defining the odd numbers as $2n+1$ , (where $2n$ is an even number and $n$ is an integer) and equating this to the expression in the hope that the intersection would return values that are odd and non-prime, however it is not the case that this equivalence returned an integer value of $n$ for which this expression is not prime.

42,Typo in math brainteaser book?,Typo in math brainteaser book?,,"A steamboat leaving pier $1$ takes $20$ hours to go against the current upriver to pier $2$ . It can return downriver with the current from pier $2$ to pier $1$ in $15$ hours. If there were no current, how long would it take for the steamboat to travel between the $2$ piers? I am told that I cannot divide the sun of $20$ and $15$ by two to get $17.5$ . I am also told that I can find the distance between the two piers by: $$\left(\dfrac x{20}\right) + \left(\dfrac x{15}\right) = 35$$ where $x$ is the distance between the two piers. But I’m so confused by this. $\dfrac x{20}$ and $\dfrac x{15}$ are rates of speed on the way up and back, respectively, so why would their sum need to equal $35$ , the total number of hours it took to go up and back? SOLUTION On being asked this question, many people will add $20$ and $15$ together and then divide the result by $2$ , obtaining $17.5$ . They will then say that it would take the steamboat $17.5$ hours to complete the trip if there were no tide. It comes as a surprise to many to learn that this result is incorrect. The surprising answer is that if there were no tide, the steamboat would complete the trip between piers in $17.142857$ hours. On the upriver trip, the steamboat would travel three-quarters of the journey in $15$ hours. On the downriver trip, the steamboat traveled the entire journey in 15 hours. Since the steamboat is traveling with the tide and against the tide for the same period of time, the effect of the tide cancels. Therefore, the steamboat would cover 1 3/4 trips in 30 hours. It would therefore do one entire trip in 30/1 3/4), or 17.142857, hours if there were no tide. This puzzle is interesting because, in addition to obtaining the required solution, we can also learn the distance between the 2 piers and the speed of the flow of the river. We know from the question that the steamboat took a total of 35 hours to do the upriver trip and the downriver journey. Let $x$ equal the distance from pier to pier. This allows us to write the following equation: $$\frac{x}{20}+\frac{x}{15}=35$$ This may be rewritten as $$15x+20x=10500$$ $$x=300$$ Therefore, the distance between both piers is 300 miles. The total journey upriver and downriver is 600 miles, and this is accomplished in 35 hours. Thus, the average speed is 600 divided by 35, or 17.142857 miles per hour. Therefore, if there were no current, the steamboat would be traveling at 17.142857 miles per hour, which confirms the answer that we have already arived at. It would therefore complete the 600-mile trip in 600/17.142857, or 35, hours. What is the speed of the river? From the question, we know that the steamboat took 20 hours to go 300 miles upriver and 15 hours to go 300 miles downriver. The steamboat traveling at 17.142857 miles per hour would do the upriver trip in 17.5 hours if there were no tide. But it takes the steamboat 20 hours, or an extra 2.5 hours, to do this journey with the tide flowing against it. Thus, the tide is flowing at the rate of 2.5 miles per hour. On the downriver trip, the steamboat traveling at the rate 17.142857 miles per hour in no tide would do the journey in 17.5 hours, but with the tide in its favor, it does the trip in 2.5 hours less, or 15 hours.

I am also interested in some methods that work for more general sum of radicals. Thank you for your interest! $\bf{Added:}$ I found this inequality by some random search. Note that all of the coefficients on LHS are positive, this can be an advantage. In the method of @heropup, one wants to check that a certain integer $N$ ( here $N=12$ ) is larger than a totally real algebraic number $\alpha$ that is  larger than all the other conjugates $\alpha_j$ .  Say its minimal polynomial is $f(x)$ .   Then we need to show that $N>$ all of the roots of $f(x)$ . Note that the roots of all derivatives of $f$ are also between the largest and the smallest of $\alpha_j$ 's. The above inequality is equivalent to $f(N)$ , $f'(N)$ , $f''(N)$ , $\ldots > 0$ .  With Taylor's formula, this is equivalent to:   the polynomial $f(N+t)$ has all of the coefficients positive in $t$ . This is an automated check that can be done instantly after we found $f(x)$ . This method does not work if $\alpha$ is not the largest ( or smallest) of all its conjugates. But there is a way to ""make it the larges"" using a transformation $x \mapsto 1/(a-x)$ . I will leave out the details. There was a previous question on this site about finding a general method for comparing arbitrary real algebraic numbers.  That seems like a quite involved problem.  It is easy to compare with $0$ a real algebraic number $\alpha$ with all its other conjugates non-real.  The test is simple $\alpha> 0$ if and only if $N(\alpha) > 0$ , where $N(\cdot)$ is the norm. In particular this applies to cubic fields with discriminant $<0$ .   The general problem of comparing with $0$ an algebraic number $\alpha$ is simple if $\alpha$ is the $k$ -th smallest ( or largest) root of an irreducible polynomial.  Indeed, one needs to see how many positive/negative roots does the polynomial have , something that can be decided ( in principle).  This is harder if one is given an expression involving several real algebraics. Even if we can find an equation whose root is the given expression, it could be harder to decide the order rank of the roots.  So this seems like a difficult problem. But perhaps it is solved somewhere in the literature. One other approach of @Parcly Taxel: simply gets rid of all the roots, little by little, something that I thought not possible just by counting.  That is interesting!  I am not fully convinced that it is so for an arbitrary number of roots as I was assured by Parcly... tempting to through another challenge to see how that works, what is the logic there... Another approach, of @Luke Collins, and @Claude Leibovici uses the approximation of square roots with their convergents. It turns out that the convergents are easy to form, since the continued fractions are periodic ( and in this case, quite simple). Summing up: some methods are ingenious and algebraic, other use some the minimal polynomial, other use continued fractions and convergents.  Perhaps I should mention that there are other way to approximate roots. Parcly seems to prefer power series.  I like Newton's method. Claude Leibovici might like Pade approximants too.

Please explain it to me or disprove my findings. Let's define an operator $\circledast$ in this way: $x \circledast y = \frac{x+y}{1+xy}$ I want to find $$((2\circledast3)\circledast4)\circledast\cdots\circledast n, \;n \ge 3$$ My Approach First thing to notice is that: $(x \circledast y) \circledast z = x \circledast (y \circledast z)$ so it doesn't make any difference which order are we applying it and so we can remove all the parenthesis and read it as say ""left to right"". Now remembering that $\tanh(x+y)=\frac{\tanh x+\tanh y}{1+\tanh x\cdot \tanh y}$ we can see that $\tanh(\tanh^{-1}x+\tanh^{-1}y)=\frac{x+y}{1+xy} = x \circledast y$ . Therefore we can rewrite the expression we want as $S = \tanh(\tanh^{-1}2+\tanh^{-1}3+...+\tanh^{-1}n)$ , so $$\tanh^{-1}S = \sum_{k=2}^n\tanh^{-1}k$$ ""So far so good"" - I would've said, but the issue is that inverse hyperbolic tangent has only domain $(-1, 1)$ over reals. But - let's roll with it, the ""why it works"" is part of the question. From here we use the logarithmic form : $\tanh^{-1}x=\frac{1}{2}\ln\frac{1+x}{1-x}$ - again, ignoring the glaring issues with the domain. We get: $$\frac{1}{2}\ln\left(\frac{1+S}{1-S}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{k=2}^n\ln\left(\frac{1+k}{1-k}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\ln\left(\prod_{k=2}^n\frac{1+k}{1-k}\right)$$ Here's another ""red flag"" - using the logarithm property of sum to product on something that potentially doesn't exist - or even if it does, it is complex, and if I understand correctly, complex version of $\ln$ is $\mathrm{Log}$ which is multivalued so it's not right to claim $\ln(ab)=\ln(a)+\ln(b)$ . Finally, we notice that if we flip the sign of the denominator we will end up with a telescoping product on the fraction shifted by 2 on the numerator to the right. Hence we end up with this: $$\frac{1}{2}\ln\left(\frac{1+S}{1-S}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\ln\left(\prod_{k=2}^n\frac{1+k}{1-k}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\ln\left((-1)^{n-1}\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)$$ We have $(-1)^{n-1}$ because there will be in total $n-1$ members (we start at $2$ and end at $n$ ). And now.. you guessed it. We got $\frac{1}{2}$ on both sides, we got $\ln$ on both sides - let's ""cancel"" them (another ""red flag"" here). If we do so we end up with $\frac{1+S}{1-S}=(-1)^{n-1}\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ thus $$S=\frac{(-1)^{n-1}(n^2+n)-2}{(-1)^{n-1}(n^2+n)+2}$$ which is not only well-defined, but also is a correct expression for $S$ (it works for any $n$ ) Question is - why does this work despite operating on things which are not well-defined? Or am I wrong and the $\tanh^{-1}x$ is well-defined outside of $(-1,1)$ ? (as well as $\ln$ and its properties over complex numbers)? EDIT : There's a proposed fix to the solution, courtesy of @Tortar . He has a great observation that $x \circledast y = \frac{1}{x} \circledast \frac{1}{y}$ and therefore we can avoid problematic domain issues if we rewrite $S = \frac{1}{2} \circledast \frac{1}{3} \circledast ... \circledast \frac{1}{n}$ . This, however, still has issues First, it doesn't explain why the original ""solution"" works. It all makes sense if I would apply this transformation before using $\tanh^{-1}$ but I do not, hence the question still stands More importantly - and this is why I decided to add this to the body of the question itself - this will lead to an incorrect result. That is because on the logarithms step we will get all valid $\ln\left(\frac{1+\frac{1}{k}}{1-\frac{1}{k}}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{k+1}{k-1}\right)$ which means that when we will combine the fractions together and remove repeating terms from it we end up losing $(-1)^{n-1}$ as there's nothing to negate. This will lead to the final expression for $S$ being invalid for all even $n$ . Therefore while this relation establishes a link between the ""wrong"" way I do it and the ""safe"" way to do it, it looks like it's not as simple as just replacing $n$ with $\frac{1}{n}$ and something is still amiss.","TL;DR: I've made something work (again) but in the process I used something which makes no sense - I wonder why it all works in the end.

By using the substitution $u = 1+bx$ , I obtained $$\left(1 + \frac ab (u-1) \right)^{1/a} = u^{1/b},$$ which led me to the nicer looking equation $$u^{a/b} - \frac abu + \frac ab -1 = 0.$$ I also noticed that using the substitution $v = u^{1/b}$ led me to $$v^a - \frac ab v^b + \frac ab -1 = 0,$$ which also yielded $$\sum_{r=0}^{a-1} v^r - \frac ab\sum_{r=0}^{b-1} v^r = 0,$$ which is an $a-1$ degree polynomial in $v$ . Interestingly, the first $b-1$ terms of this polynomial have the same coefficient equal to $1 - a/b$ and the rest have a coefficient equal to $1$ . But, through either of these approaches, I still get stuck. Any help would be much appreciated! Sorry for the late response! There were some mistakes on my part, and I hope to correct them here in this edit. Proof of unique solution $x < -2/b$ . Begin by raising $a$ on both sides to obtain $$1 + ax = (1 + bx)^{a/b} \implies 0 = (1 + bx)^{a/b} - ax - 1.$$ Define $f(x) = (1 + bx)^{a/b} - ax - 1$ . Its derivative is given by $$f'(x) = a(1 + bx)^{\frac ab - 1} - a = a((1+bx)^{\frac {a-b}b} - 1).$$ Now, since $a,b$ are both positive odd integers with $a  >b$ , we have that $a-b$ is a positive even integer, and thus, $$(1 + bx)^{\frac{a-b}b} \geq 0$$ holds over all real $x$ . The quantity $(1 + bx)^{\frac{a-b}b} \leq 1$ only when $|1 + bx| \leq 1$ , or when $-2/b \leq x \leq 0$ , and similarly $(1 + bx)^{\frac{a-b}b} \geq 1$ only when $|1 + bx| \geq 1$ , or when either $x \geq 0$ or $x \leq -2/b$ . Finally, note that $(1 + bx)^{\frac{a-b}b} = 1$ when $|1 + bx| = 1$ , or when $x = 0$ or $x = -2/b$ . From here, since $a > 0$ , we have that $$f'(x) > 0 \quad \text{when } x \in (-\infty, -2/b) \cup (0, \infty),$$ and $$f'(x) < 0 \quad \text{when } x \in (-2/b, 0),$$ and $$f'(x) = 0 \quad \text{when } x = 0, -2/b.$$ Here I've used interval notation to denote the possible values of $x$ . Notice $f(0) = 0$ . Since $f$ strictly increases for $x > 0$ , we have that $f(x) > f(0) = 0$ for all $x > 0$ . Now, $f$ strictly decreases for $-2/b < x < 0$ , so $f(x) > f(0) = 0$ , for $-2/b < x < 0$ , which implies that there are no roots in the interval $(-2/b, 0)$ . Finally, we note the value $f(-2/b) = 2a/b - 2$ , for which, since $a/b > 1$ , we have $2a/b - 2 > 0$ . The function $f$ strictly increases for $x < -2/b$ , so $f(x) < f(-2/b)$ , and in particular, $f$ is injective on this interval. That is, on this interval, $$f(s) = f(t) \implies s = t, \quad \text{for } s,t < -2/b.$$ Since $f(-2/b) > 0$ , there is exactly one $x$ with $x < -2/b$ such that $f(x) = 0$ , signaling the end of the proof. For a more visual representation of this proof, see this Desmos graph. I should also mention some background on how I stumbled across this problem. I was investigating a generalization of Bernoulli's inequality, for which the classic version states that $$(1 + x)^n \geq 1 + nx$$ for $n = 1,2,\dots$ and $x \geq -1$ . In particular, I was investigating the inequality $$\left(1 + x\right)^{\frac ab} \geq 1 + \frac ab x$$ over real $x$ and positive integers $a,b$ and determining when the above holds. It is known that the above holds for $x \geq -1$ , which can be shown with calculus over real $a/b$ . ( Here's the Wikipedia page if you're interested. ) However, I was more interested with the case in which $x < -1$ . There must be additional restrictions, however, in particular $b$ must be odd, or $(1 + x)^{a/b}$ will not be a real number. I was able to show that the inequality held for all real $x$ when $a$ was even, however, for odd $a$ , I had determined that there was a negative nonzero solution to the equation $$(1 + x)^{a/b} = 1 + \frac ab x.$$ At this solution, say $x_0$ , I had that the inequality did not hold for $x < x_0$ . To obtain the original inequality I posted here, you raise both sides by $1/a$ and take the transformation $x \mapsto bx$ , which gave the much more aesthetically pleasing equation $$(1 + ax)^{1/a} = (1 + bx)^{1/b}.$$ From here, I think it would be appropriate to ask a few other questions other than ""what's the solution?"". In particular, for positive integers $n,m$ , if $R(n,m)$ is the solution to the equation, $$(1 + (2n-1)x)^{2n-1} = (1 + (2m-1)x)^{2m-1},$$ then... Can we approximate $R(n,m)$ to a precise degree?
