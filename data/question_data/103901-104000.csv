2,An algorithm for filling a moving truck,An algorithm for filling a moving truck,,"I was recently helping a friend move. I stood in the moving truck as other people brought boxes and furniture pieces from inside the house. My job was to arrange these items in an efficient way inside the truck. I had no idea what the size or shape of the next object would be. But as more objects came, I had a rough idea of the average shape and size of the boxes and containers in the house, and I could develop an expected size and shape for the next object. I wonder, is there an algorithm for this type of problem. Formally, I think the problem would be worded like this: Let $X$ be a set of $m$-dimensional geometric objects of unknown size and shape, and let $S\subset\mathbb R^m$ be bounded. Suppose that $n-1$ objects are randomly selected from $X$, and arranged in a non-overlapping manner in $S$. Suppose that an $n^\text{th}$ object is randomly selected from $X$ (so that this object's size and shape are now known). What is the optimal way to place this object in $S$ so that as many randomly selected objects from $X$ may be placed in $S$ as possible in the future? If this problem is far too general, it may be assumed that all of the geometric objects are rectangular prisms, and that $m=3$. I am not familiar with solving this type of problem.

24,Relationship between Surface Area and Volume,Relationship between Surface Area and Volume,,"Question: Is there a general relationship between surface area and volume analogous to the below examples? Example 1. Consider a ball $B$ centered at the origin of a spherical coordinate system. The ball has volume $V(r) = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$, where $r$ is the radial distance from the origin to the boundary $\partial B$ of the ball. Now consider the surface area of $\partial V$. Elementary geometry shows that $A(r) = 4 \pi r^2$. Comparing $A$ and $V$, it follows that $$ \frac{\partial V}{\partial r} = A. $$ Example 2. Another simple example is an open cylinder of length $l$. Place the cylinder at the origin and then define $s$ as the radial distance from the origin (in cylindrical coordinates). The volume of the cylinder is $V(s) = \pi s^2 l$ and its surface area is $A(s) = 2 \pi s l$. Once again, we have a relationship between volume and surface area with reference to the variable of variation (e.g., $s$ is the variable of variation, since both the volume and cylinder share the common length $l$), $$ \frac{\partial V}{\partial s} = A. $$ Example 3. Although a cube may seem to stray from this relationship, as $\partial_s (s^3) \neq 6s^2$, this is only due to the lack of symmetry. If we center the cube in a Cartesian coordinate system, and define $a$ to be half the side length $s$, we see that $V(a) = (2a)^3 = 8a^3$ and $A(a) = 6(2a)^2 = 24a^2$.

39,Simple 2D Voronoi Diagram Question with 3 Points,Simple 2D Voronoi Diagram Question with 3 Points,,"This is a HW question for the course MAT480 (Mathematical Modelling I) at Athabasca University. I'm taking this distance course for credit in order to graduate sooner. Having a hard time putting all pieces together. Question A business park occupies a square area with sides of length 2M . Two copy shops are located symmetrically on the north-south line that bisects this square, at positions (0, +d) and (0, -d) in Cartesian co-ordinates, with the origin at the centre of the square. Assume that a third copy shop plans to locate at a position (r,0) Taking d = pM and r = qM with $0\le p , q\le 1$, use a Voronoi analysis to compute the area of the territory whose points are closest to this new shop. You will need to consider three separate cases. a. Show that these three cases are distinguished by the conditions: Case 1: $0\le p \le q \le 1$ Case 2: $0 \le \sqrt{1+p^2} - 1\le q \le p \le 1$ Case 3: $0 \le q \le \sqrt{1+p^2} -1  \le p \le 1$ What I have figured out I spent about countless hours figuring out what I have so far, and 1 hour with one very kind teacher at University of Ottawa too. Here: Scale: instead of dealing with the original square of area $4M^2$, I simply use a square of area of 4 $units^2$ (i.e. first quadrant is unit square.) The above makes us deal with points at $(0, \pm p)$ and $(q, 0)$. First Quadrant: I'm only looking at the first quadrant (perhaps second when needed) to compute area. Then multiply by two, everything is symmetrical below. Points: new shop $(q, 0)$ is P , two old shops are S1 $(0, p)$ and S2 $(0, -p)$ Let $l$ be the line of the Voronoi diagram that ""cuts"" through first quadrant diagonally. This line is all the middle points between S1 and P and, as a function of $x$ is simply: $$ l = \frac{p^2 - q^2}{2p} + x \frac{q}{p} $$ Let Q be the point where the Voronoi vertices meet. It's the point at same distance of P , S1 and S2 . We note that Q lays on the x-axis (it's the intersect of $l$) and has coordinates $(x_Q,0)$ Thus: $$ x_Q = \frac{q^2 - p^2}{2q} $$ Let W be the point where $l$ intersects with the line $y=1$. W has coordinates $(x_W, 1)$ Thus: $$ x_W = \frac{p}{q} + x_Q = \frac{p}{q} \left( 1 + \frac{q^2 - p^2}{2p} \right) $$ Let Z be the point where $l$ intersects with the line $x=1$. Z has coordinates $(1, y_Z)$ Thus: $$ y_Z =  \frac{q}{p} + \frac{p^2 - q^2}{2p} $$ Case 1 Now, as you can probably envision, the difference between the three cases is really a matter of ""how"" the area is computed. What I can completely understand, right of the start is that Case 1: $0\le p \le q \le 1$ is that only time when the origin DOES NOT belong to P territory. We noticed that here, $x_Q \ge 0$ (obvious since $q \ge p$) and that $x_W \leq 1$. Here's why: $$ x_W \le 1 $$ $$ \frac{p}{q} + x_Q \le 1 $$ $$ \frac{p}{q} \le 1 - x_Q $$ $$ p \le q - qx_Q $$ $$ p \le q $$ So the area is simply ""area triangle"" + ""area rectangle"" times 2: the area of the rectangle triangle of height 1 running from $x_Q$ to $x_W$ PLUS the area of the rectangle of height 1 running from $x_W$ to 1. (mult by 2). I got: $$ 2 \left[ \frac{(x_W - x_Q)(1)}{2} + (1-x_W)(1) \right] = x_W - x_Q + 2 - 2x_W =  2 - x_Q - x_W = 2 - x_Q - \left(\frac{p}{q} + x_Q\right) = 2 - 2x_Q - \frac{p}{q} = 2 + \frac{p^2 - p - q^2}{q}  $$ Case 2 and Case 3 Of course, here, $x_Q \leq 0$ so the origin is now part of P territory. This is where my work has come to an abrupt halt. I'm still having trouble making sense of the condition including $\sqrt{1+p^2}$. I know what it is geometrically, it's the length of the hypothenuse of the triangle S1 , origin and $(1,1)$, or more simply, it's the distance from S1 to $(1,1)$. My intuition tells that that wether $q$ is bigger or smaller than $\sqrt{1+p^2} -1$ will make $x_W$ be before/after the line $x=1$ ... but how? I've tried several inequalities to no avail. Where I need your help, simply: For now, I think it boils down to this... Is $x_W$ smaller or greater than 1 in cases 2 and 3? Recall the info above: Case 2: $0 \le \sqrt{1+p^2} - 1\le q \le p \le 1$ Case 3: $0 \le q \le \sqrt{1+p^2} -1  \le p \le 1$ $$ x_W = \frac{p}{q} \left( 1 + \frac{q^2 - p^2}{2p} \right) $$ Thanks for your help!","This is a HW question for the course MAT480 (Mathematical Modelling I) at Athabasca University.

Hopefully, someone can provide some insight as to whether this concept exists in mathematics or I'm exploring a dead-end. I am interested in whether a quantifiable measure of ""maneuverability"" in an arbitrary space exists.  The normal Euclidean spaces provide a good way to illustrate my question. An object in a zero dimensional space has zero maneuverability.  An object (say a point) can't move outside of its universe (the identical point).  This would seem to be the lower limit of maneuverability i.e. zero. A one dimensional space seems to have more maneuverability.  For example, imagine a infinte line universe with objects like points and/or line segments placed randomly on the line.  The points and line segments can now move along the line until they bump into one of their neighbors.  Interestingly, it is impossible for the point or line segment to ""jump"" over their neighbor.  Hence they are confined to a predetermined subset of the one dimensional space. A two dimension space provides even more maneuverability.  Say a square and a triangle exist in this space.  Now the square and triangle can move in two degrees of freedom.  Importantly, now the square for example can potentially completely encircle its neighbor the triangle.  Arbitrarily, the square should be able to explore any part of the two dimensional space. I struggle to formulate whether three dimensional space inherently has more maneuverability than two dimensional space.  Naively, it seems to have more maneuverability than 2D but still the best that can be accomplished is that an object can fully explore the 3D space (same as the 2D space).  So a key question is does the 3D space have quantifiably more maneuverability than the 2D space? I realize that to some extent the maneuverability is impacted by how ""full"" you make the space with objects; however, I am interested in the inherent maneuverability of the space concept rather than an actual configuration specific definition.  The key assumption is that solid objects exist i.e. they can't be passed through by another object which in the 1D case prevents an object from arbitrarily exploring its full space.

Consider $\mathbb{R}^2$ together with the lattice $\Lambda=\{(n,m): n,m\in \mathbb{Z}\}$ .

87,"Is it possible to find the intersection of this involute and roulette, given their parametric equations?","Is it possible to find the intersection of this involute and roulette, given their parametric equations?",,"Background I have two parametric curves, and I want to find the parameter values of their intersection point closest to zero under certain conditions. The first curve is an involute of a circle with parameter theta: $$ x_1(θ) = \frac{Z}{2} ⋅ \cos(α) ⋅ (\cos(θ − \tan(α) + α) + θ ⋅ \sin(θ − \tan(α) + α)), $$ $$ y_1(θ) = \frac{Z}{2} ⋅ \cos(α) ⋅ (\sin(θ − \tan(α) + α) − θ ⋅ \cos(θ − \tan(α) + α)), $$ $$ 0 ≤ θ_{min} ≤ θ ≤ θ_{max} $$ (note that theta must always be greater than or equal to zero) And the second curve is a roulette with parameter gamma: $$ \begin{align} x_2(γ) =& \left(1 - \frac{\operatorname{sgn}(P) ⋅ F}{\sqrt{P^2 + \left(γ ⋅ \frac{Z}{2}\right)^2}}\right) ⋅ \left(\operatorname{sgn}(P) ⋅ γ ⋅ \frac{Z}{2} ⋅ \sin(\operatorname{sgn}(P) ⋅ γ + Q) + P ⋅ \cos(\operatorname{sgn}(P) ⋅ γ + Q)\right) \\  +& \frac{Z}{2} ⋅ \cos(\operatorname{sgn}(P) ⋅ γ + Q) - (1 - \operatorname{sgn}(P)^2) ⋅ F ⋅ \cos(γ - Q), \end{align} $$ $$ \begin{align} y_2(γ) =& \left(1 - \frac{\operatorname{sgn}(P) ⋅ F}{\sqrt{P^2 + \left(γ ⋅ \frac{Z}{2}\right)^2}}\right) ⋅ \left(\operatorname{sgn}(P) ⋅ γ ⋅ \frac{Z}{2} ⋅ \cos(\operatorname{sgn}(P) ⋅ γ + Q) - P ⋅ \cos(\operatorname{sgn}(P) ⋅ γ + Q)\right) \\  -& \frac{Z}{2} ⋅ \sin(\operatorname{sgn}(P) ⋅ γ + Q) - (1 - \operatorname{sgn}(P)^2) ⋅ F ⋅ \sin(γ - Q), \end{align} $$ $$ γ_{min} ≤ γ ≤ 0 $$ where $P := X - C + F$ and $Q := \frac{F ⋅ \sec(α) - P ⋅ \tan(α)}{\frac{Z}{2}}$ . The equations for the two curves are built with five independent variables: $Z$ is a positive integer, $X$ is a real number in the closed interval $[−1, 1]$ , $C$ is a real number in the closed interval $[1, 1.5]$ , $F$ is a real number in both the closed intervals $\left[0, (\tan(α) + \sec(α)) ⋅ \left(\frac{π}{4} - C ⋅ \tan(α)\right)\right]$ and $\left[0, (\tan(α) + \sec(α)) ⋅ \sec(α) ⋅ (C - 1)\right]$ , and $α$ is an angle in the closed interval $\left[0, \arctan\left(\frac{π}{4 ⋅ C}\right)\right]$ . The upper boundaries of the parameter values are $θ_{max} = \frac{\sqrt{\left(X + \frac{Z}{2} + 1\right)^2 - \left(\frac{Z}{2} ⋅ \cos(α)\right)^2}}{\frac{Z}{2} ⋅ \cos(α)}$ and $γ_{max} = 0$ $θ_{min}$ and $γ_{min}$ are the parameter values at the intersection that I want to find. I know that the curves have a touching intersection (where their tangents are the same) at the parameter values $θ = \frac{P}{\frac{Z}{2} ⋅ \tan(α)} - Q + \tan(α)$ and $γ = (1 - \operatorname{sgn}(P)^2) ⋅ \left(α - \frac{π}{2}\right) - \frac{\operatorname{abs}(P)}{\frac{Z}{2} ⋅ \tan(α)}$ (See the red and blue curves in the following picture.) However, when the values of the five variables are such that $\frac{P}{\frac{Z}{2} ⋅ \tan(α)} - Q + \tan(α) < 0$ , two things happen: The value of $θ_{max}$ from the above definition becomes negative, which makes it invalid for my purposes, and A transversal intersection (where the curves' tangents are distinct) appears at values of gamma and theta closer to zero than those for the touching intersection, and specifically with a positive value of theta. (See the red and blue curves in the following picture.) This transversal intersection does also exist when $\frac{P}{\frac{Z}{2} ⋅ \tan(α)} - Q + \tan(α) ≥ 0$ , it's just at a negative (invalid) value of theta and is thus hidden. The Problem I want to find closed-form expressions for the parameter values $θ_{min}$ and $γ_{min}$ at this transversal intersection in terms of $α$ , $Z$ , $X$ , $C$ , and $F$ , in the specific case where $\frac{P}{\frac{Z}{2} ⋅ \tan(α)} - Q + \tan(α) < 0$ , given the stated domains of the independent variables $α$ , $Z$ , $X$ , $C$ , and $F$ . Additionally, when that inequality is true, $θ_{min}$ should always be strictly greater than zero. When that inequality is not true, the value of any new expression for $θ_{min}$ is irrelevant, because I already have expressions that work in that case, so it's fine if the new expression is undefined or negative when that inequality is not true. Is it possible to find closed-form expressions here? Where These Curves Come From The curve with parameter theta is a portion of the envelope of the line described by the equation $$ \ \ \ \ \sin(β + α) ⋅ x \\ - \cos(β + α) ⋅ y \\ = \frac{Z}{2} ⋅ (\sin(α) + β ⋅ \cos(α)) $$ as the parameter $β$ varies from $-∞$ to $+∞$ . Specifically, it is the path of the point on that line with $(x, y)$ coordinates $$ \begin{pmatrix}\begin{align} &\frac{Z}{2} ⋅ \cos(α) ⋅ (\cos(α + β) + \sin(α + β) ⋅ (\tan(α) + β)), \\ &\frac{Z}{2} ⋅ \cos(α) ⋅ (\sin(α + β) - \cos(α + β) ⋅ (\tan(α) + β)) \end{align}\end{pmatrix} $$ The curve with parameter gamma is the path of one of the intersection points of the line $$ \ \ \ \ \left(\left(β ⋅ \frac{Z}{2} + Q\right) ⋅ \cos(β) - P ⋅ \sin(β)\right) ⋅ x \\ + \left(\left(β ⋅ \frac{Z}{2} + Q\right) ⋅ \sin(β) + P ⋅ \cos(β)\right) ⋅ y \\ = \frac{Z}{2} ⋅ \left(β ⋅ \frac{Z}{2} + Q\right) $$ with the circle $$ \ \ \ \ \left(x - \left(\left(\frac{Z}{2} + P\right) ⋅ \cos(β) + \left(β ⋅ \frac{Z}{2} + Q\right) ⋅ \sin(β)\right)\right)^2 \\ + \left(y - \left(\left(\frac{Z}{2} + P\right) ⋅ \sin(β) - \left(β ⋅ \frac{Z}{2} + Q\right) ⋅ \cos(β)\right)\right)^2 \\ = F^2 $$ I've tried to find a way to relate the envelope of the first line, and its generating point, with the path of the second point. I've had no success so far, but I'm hopeful that a way to do so does exist. What Else I Know I do know that on the first curve, the radius of a point for a given value of theta is $r(θ) = \frac{Z}{2} ⋅ \cos(α) ⋅ \sqrt{θ^2 + 1}$ , and conversely the value of theta for a given radius is $θ(r) = \sqrt{\left(\frac{2 ⋅ r} {Z ⋅ \cos(α)}\right)^2 − 1}$ . This means that if I can find the radius of the transversal intersection point by any process, I can easily convert it into the value for $θ_{min}$ , and vice versa. I also know that the angle made with the $x$ -axis by a point on the curve at a given value of theta is $β(θ) = θ − \arctan(θ) + α − \tan(α)$ , which is transcendental and has no closed-form inverse, so I cannot use a known angle to find the value of theta. The same goes for the second curve, just with much more complicated expressions. Thus, if I get either one of $θ_{min}$ or $γ_{min}$ , I can use that value to find the other. If I can find the radius of the intersection separately, I can use it to find both values. Given these expressions, I know that the radius of the touching intersection is $r = \sqrt{(F - P ⋅ \csc(α))^2 + Z ⋅ (P - F ⋅ \sin(α)) + \left(\frac{Z}{2}\right)^2}$ . I've attempted to find a similar expression for the transversal intersection by working backwards from numerically-calculated values, without any success yet. For example, by plotting the two curves in graphing software and numerically calculating the parameter values of their intersections to ten decimal places, I created this plot, which shows the $γ_{min}$ value against the pressure angle $α$ (including some technically-invalid negative values of $α$ to get a broader sample size) for four different values of $Z$ , all with $X = 0$ , $C = 1$ , and $F = 0$ : The green lines show the known expression $γ_{min}(α)$ , while the red points are samples of the unknown expression for which I am searching. I've been trying to fit a curve to the red points, unfortunately without any success yet. As stated above, if I can find the equation that describes the red points and thus the value of $γ_{min}$ , I can use that to also find the value of $θ_{min}$ , which would completely solve my problem. Similarly, I numerically calculated the $θ_{min}$ values for $1°$ increments of $α$ with $Z = 24$ , $X = 0$ , $C = 1.25$ , and $F = 0$ and plotted the results. This shows that the unknown expression for $θ_{min}(α)$ is very close to half the known expression for $θ_{min}(α)$ reflected over the vertical line where $θ_{min}(α) = 0$ : To see what the difference is between that squashed reflection and the sampled points, I also plotted points where that curve is subtracted from the vertical coordinate, in red, and points where the vertical coordinate is divided by the height of that curve, in green: These sets of points look very much like they should be described by combinations of trig functions, but I haven't been able to find combinations that fit them exactly. I also figured out that the value of $γ_{min}$ seems to have an upper bound of $-\sqrt{\frac{T^2 - P^2}{\left(\frac{Z}{2}\right)^2}} - (1 - \operatorname{sgn}(P)^2) ⋅ \arccos\left(\frac{F^2 - \left(\frac{Z}{2}\right)^2 ⋅ (\cos(α)^2 - 1)}{2 ⋅ F ⋅ \frac{Z}{2}}\right)$ , where $$ T := \sqrt[3]{-\frac{F ⋅ B}{3} + \sqrt{\left(\frac{F ⋅ B}{3}\right)^2 + \left(P ⋅ Z - \frac{\left(\frac{2}{3} ⋅ F\right)^2 - B}{3}\right)^3}}\\   + \sqrt[3]{-\frac{F ⋅ B}{3} - \sqrt{\left(\frac{F ⋅ B}{3}\right)^2 + \left(P ⋅ Z - \frac{\left(\frac{2}{3} ⋅ F\right)^2 - B}{3}\right)^3}}\\   - \frac{2}{3} ⋅ F $$ and $$ B := \frac{\left(\frac{F}{3}\right)^2 - \frac{Z}{2} ⋅ \left(\frac{Z}{2} ⋅ (A^2 - 1) + P\right)}{3} $$ but I haven't been able to refine that into an exact solution. Context The curve with parameter theta is the involute face curve of a tooth on an involute gear, while the curve with parameter gamma is the roulette root curve of the same tooth. These curves are naturally generated in real life by the gear-shaping process called hobbing , without needing any fancy math. Representing them in a computer, which I want to do, is more difficult. The shapes of these curves are defined by five variables: $α$ , the angle of the contact force between meshed gear teeth, called the pressure angle ; $Z$ , the number of teeth on the gear; $X$ , the profile shift coefficient , specifying how far in or out the cutting tool is moved compared to cutting a standard gear profile; $C$ , the clearance factor , specifying how much clearance there is between the tooth roots on one gear and the tooth tips on a meshing gear as a multiple of the overall tooth height (a value of 1 gives zero clearance, a value of 1.5 gives half a tooth-height of clearance); and $F$ , the root fillet radius , specifying the radius of the fillet curve that joins the roots of the teeth to the faces of the teeth. There is one more gear design variable, called module or pitch , which describes the overall size of the gear. Because this variable is a uniform scaling factor, it has no effect on the angles involved or on the values of theta and gamma, so I have left it out of the equations for the sake of simplicity. When $\frac{P}{\frac{Z}{2} ⋅ \tan(α)} - Q + \tan(α) ≥ 0$ , the involute face curve transitions smoothly into the roulette root curve (with a touching intersection). However, when $\frac{P}{\frac{Z}{2} ⋅ \tan(α)} - Q + \tan(α) < 0$ , the root curve cuts off some of the face curve (with a transversal intersection). This is called undercutting and is in general undesirable, as it reduces the strength of the gear. However, small amounts of undercutting are tolerated in many situations. I want to find the point on each curve where this undercutting occurs so I can accurately draw an undercut gear in software. This question is very similar to another question on this site , but that question's answer doesn't address my particular problem.","Background I have two parametric curves, and I want to find the parameter values of their intersection point closest to zero under certain conditions.

Lemma : Let $ABC$ be a triangle with orthocenter $H$ , and suppose that $E$ and $F$ are the feet of the $B$ and $C$ -altitudes. Suppose that the circumcircle of triangle $AEF$ meets the circumcircle of triangle $ABC$ again at $K$ . Let $M$ be the midpoint of $BC$ . Then we have $K, H,$ and $M$ are collinear. Proof of the Lemma : Sine $HF\perp AB$ and $HE\perp AC$ , we note that $H\in (AEF)$ . So $\angle AKH= \angle AFH = 90^{\circ}$ Let $KH\cap(ABC)=X$ . Note that since, $\angle AKH=90^{\circ}$ , we have $X=$ diametrically opposite point of $A$ . But by a known lemma , we know that $H,M,X$ are collinear . So we have $K$ , $ H,$ M$ are collinear. Now, using this Lemma, we claim that $MNPQ$ is cyclic Claim : $MNPQ$ is cyclic Proof: By the above Lemma, we get $H'MHP$ and $QHN{H'}_1$ are collinear, where $H""M=HM$ and $H'$ is the antipode of $P$ wrt $(ABC)$ and $N{H'}_1=HN$ and ${H'}_1$ is the antipode of $Q$ wrt $(ABC)$ .

[And BTW, apologies for possibly not using the correct mathematical notation]. I have a set of $k$ vectors of length $1$ , which I obtain by subtracting a reference point $P$ from $k$ other points $B_1, B_2, ..., B_k$ , and then dividing each by its norm. If the points are expressed as ordered sets of coordinates, then: $$\vec v_i = \frac {B_i - P} {||B_i - P||} $$ All $B_i$ 's are distinct, and none of them coincides with $P$ . Here are 4 example vectors: $\vec v_1 = (-\frac 1 5, \frac 9 {10}, \frac {\sqrt 3} {2 \sqrt 5})$ $\vec v_2 = (\frac 3 5, \frac 2 {5},  2 \frac {\sqrt 3} {5})$ $\vec v_3 = (\frac 9 {10}, - \frac 1 {5}, \frac {\sqrt 3} {2 \sqrt 5})$ $\vec v_4 = (\frac 3 {10}, \frac 9 {10}, - \frac {1} {\sqrt 2 \sqrt 5})$ Question : how to find a vector $\vec r$ such that the largest of the $k$ angles between $\vec r$ and each $\vec v_i$ is minimized (all angles being $\le \pi$ ), i.e. such that the smallest of the $k$ dot products between $\vec r$ and each $\vec v_i$ is maximized ? If I had only $\vec v_1$ and $\vec v_2$ , $\vec r$ would be $\vec v_1 + \vec v_2$ , as then: $\frac {\vec r \cdot \vec v_1} {||\vec r||} = \frac {\vec r \cdot \vec v_2} {||\vec r||} \approx 0.868$ Taking $\vec r$ any 'closer' to $\vec v_1$ would make the angle with $\vec v_2$ larger (i.e. the dot product smaller). However, when I have more than 2 vectors, I don't know how to do the calculation. I tried numerically, and I found that, for instance, when I have $\vec v_1, \vec v_2, \vec v_3$ , only $\vec v_1$ and $\vec v_3$ 'matter', so $\vec r = \vec v_1 + \vec v_3$ . $\vec v_1,\vec v_3$ happens to be the pair of vectors with the smallest dot product ( $\approx - 0.21$ ). Seeing this, I thought that only the pair $\vec v_i, \vec v_j$ with the largest angle to start with mattered, and when the vectors are in 2D (i.e. when I don't use the 3rd coordinate) this actually works: I just need to loop over all the possible $\frac {k (k-1)} 2$ pairs of vectors, find the pair that has the smallest dot product, and $\vec r$ is the sum of those two vectors. However, this does not work in 3D. Even in 3D, and including $\vec v_4$ in the set, $\vec v_1,\vec v_3$ is still the pair of vectors with smallest dot product. However the numerical result is $\vec r \approx (0.632, 0.632, 0.449)$ , which gives the same dot product ( $\approx 0.616$ ) with $\vec v_1$ , $\vec v_3$ and $\vec v_4$ . I suppose this cannot be a coincidence, and it makes me suspect that $\vec r$ is always some type of combination of the $\vec v_i$ 's, but I would not know how to derive a formula or method, or in fact if it makes sense at all. The fact that I minimize the maximal angle is reminiscent of linear programming, but then again I have no clue if and how this could be applied here, given that the dot product is not linear. And in fact ultimately my goal would be to have a method that works with vectors in any number of dimensions. Any ideas/suggestions? Thanks! EDIT after some further work Suppose I know that I want to find the vector that has the same angle with 3 other vectors, in this case the ones found via the numerical procedure. $\vec r =(x,y,z)$ $\vec r \cdot \vec v_1 = a$ $\vec r \cdot \vec v_3 = a$ $\vec r \cdot \vec v_4 = a$ If I solve this system, I get: $[x=1.0254 \cdot a, y=1.0254 \cdot a, z=0.7287 \cdot a]$ Any $a > 0$ gives me a valid $\vec r$ . But then I still don't know how to identify the 3 vectors in a general case, or actually if this is indeed a generally valid method. If it is, I would guess that in $d$ dimensions I need to use $d$ vectors(?). Maybe I should investigate the LP solution Don hinted to in the comment below...

99,Ratio between farthest and second farthest distance,Ratio between farthest and second farthest distance,,"$n\geq 3$ points lie in three-dimensional space. What is the largest $c(n)$ such that there always exists a point for which the ratio between the distance to the farthest point from it and the distance to the second farthest point from it is at most $c(n)$? In the case where $n=3$ and all three points are on a line, we can suppose that the distance between the first and second point is $a$, and between the second and third point is $b$, where $a\leq b$. The ratios from each of the three points are $\frac{a+b}{a},\frac{b}{a},\frac{a+b}{b}$. Among these ratios, $\frac{a+b}{a}$ is the highest, so we may ignore it. The remaining two ratios are equalized when $\frac{b}{a}=\frac{\sqrt{5}+1}{2}$.","$n\geq 3$ points lie in three-dimensional space.
