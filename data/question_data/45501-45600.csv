The accepted answer there gives some answer to my question here, but the question is not a duplicate... I'm currently brushing up on some algebra with ""Abstract Algebra"" by Grillet, Second Edition. We consider, for a unital Ring $R$ and a family of sets $(X_i)_{i\in I}$ the polynomial ring  $$ R[(X_i)_{i\in I}] $$ I don't think the details of this construction are too important here; suffice it to say that we are dealing with the free $R$-algebra over the free commutative monoid of all monomials $$ X^k=\Pi_{i\in I}\, X^{k_i}\,,\; k \in \mathbb{N}^I\,, k_i = 0\, \text{ for almost all } i $$ with multiplication $X^k X^l = X^{k+l}$. The degree of a polynomial $0 \neq A \in R[(X_i)_{i\in I}]$ with coefficients $a_k$ is defined as $$ \max\left\{\sum_{i \in I} k_i;\, k\in I^\mathbb{N}\,,\, k_i = 0\, \text{ for almost all } i\, \land \, a_k \neq 0\right\} $$ I generally put quite a lot of trust into textbooks as carefully written as this one, but the following statement on page 127 seems wrong to me and I am stuck trying to prove it: Proposition 6.4 . For all $A, B \neq 0$ in $R[(X_i)_{i\in I}]$: ... (4) if $R$ has no zero divisors, then $\deg(\,AB\,) = \deg A + \deg B$ What I have proven is $\deg(\,AB\,) \leq \deg A + \deg B$, which was part (3) of the proposition. However, part (4) baffles me. I started out expecting this to be easy but got stuck; and now I'm really a little too exhausted because I couldn't let go and kept on thinking about how to prove this. I'm actually wondering if this is actually wrong and was just a copy-paste error from the corresponding page 121 for the univariate case, where we have the exact same statement, safe for there only being one variable. A counterexample is probably not that hard, but I'm really too tired right now, and then I actually already got sidetracked just brushing up on basics required for my bachelor's thesis with this already, in the first place.

In the univariate case, the degree formula holds if $R$ has no zero divisors, because the leading coefficient of the product is the product of the leading coefficients. However, in the multivariate case, each coefficient can be a sum of products: Picking indices $\nu\,,\, \mu$ with $\sum_i \nu_i = \deg A$ and $\sum_i \mu_i = \deg B$, I don't see how $R$ having no zero divisors would lead to the coefficient $$ (AB)_{\nu + \mu} = \sum_{(m,\,n) \in (I^\mathbb{N})^2;\,m + n = \nu + \mu} a_m b_n $$ being nonzero, although it seems obvious that $AB \neq 0$ if we look at the $i$-degree $$ \max\left\{k_i;\, k\in I^\mathbb{N}\,,\, k_j = 0\, \text{ for almost all } j\, \land \, a_k \neq 0\right\} $$ for some $i \in I$ (should I be wrong with this reasoning, please tell me) , so that $R[(X_i)_{i\in I}]$ is a domain, if $R$ is.

4,Definition of the generating set of a ring,Definition of the generating set of a ring,,"I'm currently working my way through the foundations of ring theory (Dummit & Foote), and I am somewhat confused on how to think about the notion of a generating set for a ring. For a group $(\mathcal{G},+,-,0)$ the notion is clear; a subset $G\subseteq\mathcal{G}$ is a generating set for $\mathcal{G}$ iff every element of $\mathcal{G}$ can be expressed as a finite composition of the members of $G$ under addition and negation. This notion still exists canonically in a ring $(\mathcal{R},+,-,\times,0,1)$, however it seems that we may want to consider a second notion as well which specifically leverages the existence of multiplication when trying to simplify the structure of a ring. Specifically, it seems like we can define a generating set for $\mathcal{R}$ as a subset $R\subseteq\mathcal{R}$ such that every element of $\mathcal{R}$ can be expressed as a finite composition of members of $R$ under addition, multiplication and negation. My question is this: Is the latter definition of a generating set for a ring well-known, and if so where can I find some literature on it? In general, the second definition yields a smaller set in order type or sometimes cardinality, and seems like it should still contain much of the information we care about for generating sets. This is easier to see when considering an example: Let $n$ be a natural number, and consider the Grothendieck ring of the limit ordinal $\omega^{\omega^n}$ under natural addition and multiplication, denoted $\mathfrak{G}(\omega^{\omega^n})$, as constructed here [if we set $n=0$ we obtain $\mathfrak{G}(\omega)=\mathbb{Z}$]. Then $$G=\{\omega^\beta\}_{\beta<\omega^n}$$ is a countable generating set for $\mathfrak{G}(\omega^{\omega^n})$ if we only use the group operations $+$ and $-$, however $$R=\{1\}\cup\{\omega^{\omega^\beta}\}_{\beta<n}$$ is a finite generating set for $\mathfrak{G}(\omega^{\omega^n})$ if we allow the usage of $\times$. In the simplest non-trivial case where $n=1$, we have $$G=\{\omega^m\}_{m<\omega},$$ $$R=\{1,\omega\}$$ as the generating sets for $\mathfrak{G}(\omega^\omega)$. When $n=2$ we have $$G=\{\omega^m\}_{m<\omega^2},$$ $$R=\{1,\omega,\omega^\omega\},$$ etc. In each situation it seems that $R$ is much simpler than $G$ and obviously recaptures its members under multiplication, since $$\omega^n\times\omega^m=\omega^{n+m},$$ $$\omega^{m\omega}\times\omega^{n\omega}=\omega^{n\omega+m\omega}=\omega^{(n+m)\omega},$$ and in general the algebraic expressions factor in the expected fashion. This seems to imply that, so long as we know that we have access to a multiplicative structure to work with, the second notion of a generating set is easier to work with than the first.","I'm currently working my way through the foundations of ring theory (Dummit & Foote), and I am somewhat confused on how to think about the notion of a generating set for a ring.

9,Understanding Quotient of a Quotient Ring,Understanding Quotient of a Quotient Ring,,"The question I am asking is very elementary I think. Suppose $R$ is an integral domain. Let $I$ be an ideal of $R$. Then we can consider the quotient ring $R/I= I_R$. Now consider an ideal $J'$ of $R/I$ , then from the fourth isomorphism theorem of ring we can say that there is an ideal $J$ of $R$ containing $I$ such that $J' = J/I $ in $R/I$.

11,Trying to factor $x^4-3$ over $\Bbb{F}_p$ with $p\equiv 3\mod{4}$,Trying to factor  over  with,x^4-3 \Bbb{F}_p p\equiv 3\mod{4},"So I am trying to show that $f(x) = x^4-3$ will factor over $\Bbb{F}_p$ when $p\equiv 3\mod 4$, with $p\neq 3$. Specifically, I am trying to show that $f$ will factor into irreducibles such that there is at least one factor of degree 2. My Work So Far So if I assume that it can be factored, we would have $$ x^4-3 = (x^2+ax+b)(x^2-ax+d) = x^4 + (b+d-a^2)x^2 + a(d-b)x + bd.$$ Because we want the linear term to be 0, we need either $a=0$ or $d-b = 0$. Now if $a=0$ we get that $b=-d$, so $-b^2 = -3$. That is, $3$ is a square. If $d-b = 0$, then we would have $b^2 = -3$, so $-3$ is a square. Because $-1$ is not a square when $p\equiv 3\mod{4}$, we know that one of $-3$ or $3$ must be a square, but not both, so $a=0$ or $d=b$, but not both. If $a=0$, that is $3$ is a square, then we have $f(x) = (x^2 +b)(x^2-b)$. Then one of $b$ or $-b$ is a square, but not the other, so $f$ will factor into two linear terms and a quadratic. So this case works. The trouble I am having is with the second case. If $d=b$, then we have  $$ f(x) = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 -ax +b)$$ with $2b = a^2$. This is where I get stuck. How do I know that such an $a$ can exist? Edit: If there is a better approach to solving this, that would be great to know as well. I haven't been taught any of the relevant number theory to solve this, so I'm kind of out of my element here.","So I am trying to show that $f(x) = x^4-3$ will factor over $\Bbb{F}_p$ when $p\equiv 3\mod 4$, with $p\neq 3$.

95,Left regular action isomorphic to the right regular action,Left regular action isomorphic to the right regular action,,"I am reading something on regular groups and I have a question on why the left and right regular actions are isomorphic. Let $G$ be a group. Consider the homomorphism $\rho: G \rightarrow Sym(G), g \mapsto \rho_g$, where $\rho_g: x \mapsto xg$.  Recall that the image $R(G)$ of this homomorphism is isomorphic to $G$ by Cayley's theorem.  Similarly, the left regular representation $L(G):=\{\lambda_g: g \in G\}$, where $\lambda_g: x \mapsto g^{-1}x$, is also isomorphic to $G$, whence $L(G) \cong R(G)$ since isomorphism is a transitive relation. Alternatively, $\rho_g \mapsto \lambda_g$ gives a direct isomorphism between $R(G)$ and $L(G)$. In the text I'm reading, action by right multiplication is defined as $\mu(x,g) = xg$.  And then the text says ``There is also a left regular representation of $G$ on itself, given by the rule that $\mu(x,g) = g^{-1} x$.  (The inverse is required here to make a proper action: note that $h^{-1}(g^{-1}x)=(gh)^{-1}x$.)

My question is on the last part that says that $x \mapsto x^{-1}$ is an isomorphism.  I thought that this was only true for abelian groups. Perhaps the fact that $x \mapsto x^{-1}$ is a bijection is what is required here, given that the text defines two actions to be isomorphic as follows: If $\rho: \Omega \times G \rightarrow \Omega$ and $\lambda: \Delta \times G \rightarrow \Delta$ are $G$-actions, then they are said to be isomorphic if there is a bijection $\theta: \Omega \rightarrow \Delta$ such that $\forall \alpha \in \Omega, g \in G$, we have $\rho(\alpha,g) \theta = \lambda(\alpha \theta,g)$, i.e., each element of $G$ effects essentially the same permutation on these two sets.
