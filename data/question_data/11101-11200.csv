So, in order to evaluate this limit, we can multiply this expression by the conjugate of the denominator. $$\lim _{x\to 2}\left(\dfrac{\sqrt{6-x}-2}{\sqrt{3-x}-1} \cdot \dfrac{\sqrt{3-x}+1}{\sqrt{3-x}+1}   \right) = \lim _{x\to 2}\left(\dfrac{(\sqrt{6-x}-2)(\sqrt{3-x}+1)}{2-x}\right) $$ But it still gives the indeterminate form $\frac{0}{0}$ . But multiplying the expression by the conjugate of the demoninator and numerator we get $$\lim _{x\to 2}\left(\dfrac{\sqrt{6-x}-2}{\sqrt{3-x}-1} \cdot \dfrac{\sqrt{3-x}+1}{\sqrt{3-x}+1} \cdot \dfrac{\sqrt{6-x}+2}{\sqrt{6-x}+2}\right) $$ $$\lim _{x\to 2}\left(\dfrac{6-x-4}{3-x-1} \cdot \dfrac{\sqrt{3-x}+1}{1} \cdot \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{6-x}+2}\right)$$ $$\lim _{x\to 2}\left(\dfrac{6-x-4}{3-x-1} \cdot \dfrac{\sqrt{3-x}+1}{\sqrt{6-x}+2}\right)$$ $$\lim _{x\to 2}\left(\dfrac{2-x}{2-x} \cdot \dfrac{\sqrt{3-x}+1}{\sqrt{6-x}+2}\right)$$ $$\lim _{x\to 2}\left(\dfrac{\sqrt{3-x}+1}{\sqrt{6-x}+2}\right)$$ Now we can evaluate the limit: $$\lim _{x\to 2}\left(\dfrac{\sqrt{3-2}+1}{\sqrt{6-2}+2}\right) = \dfrac{1}{2}$$ Taking this example, I would like to understand why rationalization was used.

The issue I have is understanding intuitively why this formula works, and exactly what it's doing. I understand the steps taken to get to this point, but there's an odd symmetry to the end result -- for example, is the fact that $\frac{2}{3}$ and its inverse are the only constants used just a coincidence, or indicative of some deeper relationship?

If I hadn't traced the steps myself, I would have never guessed that the formula was in any way related to the original problem. If possible, can somebody give an intuitive explanation as to why this formula works, and how to interpret it geometrically?

The question is Compute the limit $$\lim_{t \to + \infty} \int_0^{+ \infty} \frac{ \mathrm d x}{e^x+ \sin (tx)}$$ Note that the integral is well defined and convergent for every $t >0$ . Indeed the integrand function is a positive function for every $t >0$ since $$e^x + \sin tx > e^x-1 > x>0$$ And as $x \to + \infty$ the integrand function behaves like $e^{-x}$ .

Now I use the fact that the integrand function does is integrated over a period of $2 \pi$ , and using the result for $C>1$ $$\int_0^{2 \pi} \frac{ \mathrm d u}{C+ \sin (u)} = \frac{2 \pi}{\sqrt{C^2-1}}$$ I get the estimate \begin{align}\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{2n \pi} \int_{2k \pi}^{(2k+2) \pi} \frac{ \mathrm d u}{e^{(k+1)/n}+ \sin (u)} &= \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{2n \pi} \frac{2 \pi}{\sqrt{e^{2(k+1)/n} -1 }} \\&= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{\sqrt{e^{2(k+1)/n} -1 }}\end{align} Summing all up, I got that $$\int_0^{+ \infty} \frac{ \mathrm d x}{e^x+ \sin (2n \pi x)} \ge \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{\sqrt{e^{2(k+1)/n} -1 }}$$ As $n \to \infty$ the series converges to the Riemann integral $$\int_0^{+ \infty} \frac{\mathrm d y}{\sqrt{e^{2y}-1}} = \frac{\pi}{2}$$ Hence the limit should be a number larger than $\pi/2$ , or $+ \infty$ .

57,A limit question (JEE $2014$),A limit question (JEE ),2014,"The following is a JEE (A national level entrance test) question: Find the largest value of the non-negative integer ( a ) for which: $$ \displaystyle \lim_{x \to 1} \left( \dfrac{-ax + \sin(x-1) + a} { x + \sin(x-1) -1 } \right)^{\dfrac{1-x}{1-\sqrt x} } = \dfrac 1 4 $$ On solving this, we get $ a = 0 $ or $ a = 2 $. So we take the answer as $ 2 $. But the official answer key says that the answer is $ 0 $. The reason given (not in the official key - they simple contain the answer.

So $ a = 0$.

73,Finding the radius of a neutron star that allows all points on its surface to be seen,Finding the radius of a neutron star that allows all points on its surface to be seen,,"At first glance, this fascinating question may seem better placed on Physics Stack Exchange. But, since I am only questioning the mathematics of the solution I decided it was more appropriate to place it here. How small should a neutron star be so that all points on its surface are visible? Hints: use the form of the photon orbit equation. Consider a trajectory where $du/dφ = 0$ for $u = 1/R_n$ and $φ = 0$ where $R_n > R$ is the ‘radius’ of the neutron star. Determine numerically, what the ratio $R_n/R$ should be so that $u = 0$ for $φ = π$ . My interpretation of this question is to find the ratio of neutron star radius, $R_n$ to that of the Schwarzschild radius, $R$ given that all points on the neutron star are visible. Taking the most extreme point for photons emanating from a point directly behind the neutron star, since we can't see through the star this point would otherwise be invisible. However, if the curvature of spacetime is so large it will deflect light coming from the back of the star, then it is possible to see this point. If this point can be seen, then by that logic all points of the neutron stars' surface will be visible too. Above is my attempt to draw the situation. The outer blue ring of the neutron star has a radius of $R_n$ and the inner (red) ring is characterized by the Schwarzschild radius, $R$ . Of course, the situation I drew above is highly contrived as we all know that the light rays emanating from the point at the back of the star will keep bending as there is no reason why they should end up in a perfect straight line. Here is the author's solution which I just cannot understand: $$\left(\frac{du}{d \varphi}\right)^2+u^2-Ru^3={R_n}^{-2}-R{R_n}^{-3}\tag{1}$$ so that $u=1/R_n$ when $du/d\varphi=0$ . Separating the variables gives $$\int_{u=0}^{1/R_n}\frac{du}{\sqrt{{R_n}^{-2}-R{R_n}^{-3}-u^2+Ru^3}}=\int_{\varphi = 0}^{\pi}d\varphi=\pi\tag{2}$$ So that all the surface is visible it is assumed that light that grazes the surface at $φ=0$ escapes to $r=∞$ or $u=0$ at $φ=π$ . Using the change of variable $p=Ru$ $$\int_{p=0}^{R/R_n}\frac{dp}{\sqrt{{(R/R_n)}^2-{(R/R_n)}^3 -p^2+p^3}}=\pi\tag{3}$$ To determine $x=R/R_n$ we need to solve $$\int_{p=0}^{R/R_n}\frac{dp}{\sqrt{{x}^2-x^3-p^2+p^3}}=\pi\tag{4}$$ Solve this numerically. The solution is $x ≈ 0.568$ giving the ratio $R_n/R = 1/x = 1.76$ . That is if the radius of a neutron star is less than $1.76$ times its Schwarzschild radius the whole surface is visible due to the deﬂection of light. Current estimates on neutron star sizes give a ratio larger than $1.76$ suggesting that the entire surface of real neutron stars is not visible. I have 2 questions regarding this solution: Below equation $(1)$ it is written that "" $u=1/R_n$ when $du/d\varphi=0$ "". But  since $du/d\varphi=0$ , a simple rearrangement of $(1)$ should mean that $$\frac{du}{d \varphi}=\pm\sqrt{{R_n}^{-2}-R{R_n}^{-3}-u^2+Ru^3}=0\tag{5}$$ If so then the denominator in the integrand of $(2)$ will diverge, so how can it ever be equal to $\pi$ ? Moreover, with $du/d\varphi =0$ then $\left(du/d\varphi\right)^2=0$ and by my logic there is no differential equation to solve. Put another way, since $u=1/R_n$ this implies that $x=p$ , then substituting $x=p$ into equation $(4)$ leads to the same fate. Why was the negative root in $(5)$ discarded? Just below equation $(4)$ it says ""Solve this numerically"". I really don't know how to do this and I'm not much of a programmer, but all I want to do is verify that this numerical integration results in $x\approx 0.568$ . Could someone please show or explain to me how this is done? Remark: One reason why I am so sceptical about the authors' solution is while typesetting the solution I have already identified 2 typos which I show below underlined in red: As can be seen above, a square root is missing in the denominator of the second equation and the ratio should strictly be written as ' $1.76$ '.","At first glance, this fascinating question may seem better placed on Physics Stack Exchange. But, since I am only questioning the mathematics of the solution I decided it was more appropriate to place it here. How small should a neutron star be so that all points on its surface are visible? Hints: use the form of the photon orbit equation. Consider a trajectory where for and where is the ‘radius’ of the neutron star. Determine numerically, what the ratio should be so that for . My interpretation of this question is to find the ratio of neutron star radius, to that of the Schwarzschild radius, given that all points on the neutron star are visible. Taking the most extreme point for photons emanating from a point directly behind the neutron star, since we can't see through the star this point would otherwise be invisible. However, if the curvature of spacetime is so large it will deflect light coming from the back of the star, then it is possible to see this point. If this point can be seen, then by that logic all points of the neutron stars' surface will be visible too. Above is my attempt to draw the situation. The outer blue ring of the neutron star has a radius of and the inner (red) ring is characterized by the Schwarzschild radius, . Of course, the situation I drew above is highly contrived as we all know that the light rays emanating from the point at the back of the star will keep bending as there is no reason why they should end up in a perfect straight line. Here is the author's solution which I just cannot understand: so that when . Separating the variables gives So that all the surface is visible it is assumed that light that grazes the surface at escapes to or at . Using the change of variable To determine we need to solve Solve this numerically. The solution is giving the ratio . That is if the radius of a neutron star is less than times its Schwarzschild radius the whole surface is visible due to the deﬂection of light. Current estimates on neutron star sizes give a ratio larger than suggesting that the entire surface of real neutron stars is not visible.

75,An Integral from Irresistible Integrals,An Integral from Irresistible Integrals,,"I have been trying to work out a question from Irresistible Integrals, but I don't know how to proceed. The exact problem is Exercise 13.7.1. It asks us to show that $$\zeta(3)=4-\zeta(2)+\frac{8}{3}\int_0^{1/2}\frac{t\ln^3(t)}{\sqrt{1-4t^2}}dt$$ The $\zeta$ in question is the Riemann Zeta Function. The book does this integral through something that its calls its ""Master Formula,"" but asks the reader to check it directly, which I assume means to compute the integral directly. The book gives the hint of expanding the integrand as a series, using $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-4x}}=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\binom{2n}{n}x^n$$ After applying this, I have $$\int_0^{1/2}\frac{t\ln^3(t)}{\sqrt{1-4t^2}}dt=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\binom{2n}{n}\int_0^{1/2}t^{2n+1}\ln^3(t)dt$$ $$=-\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{1}{2^{2n+2}}\binom{2n}{n}\left(\frac{\ln^3(2)}{2n+2}+\frac{3\ln^2(2)}{(2n+2)^2}+\frac{6\ln(2)}{(2n+2)^3}+\frac{6}{(2n+2)^4}\right)$$ (If someone wants to check that to makes sure I'm right, then by all means, go for it) I get stuck from here. I have a few tricks to evaluate the sum for the first two terms, but not the last two terms. If you have any ideas on how to evaluate this sum (or an alternate way of evaluating this integral in the first place), let me know. Thanks! Edit : Considering that this integral is being multiplied by $8/3$ in the original problem, it may be convenient to fact or out the $8/3$ to get $$\frac{8}{3}\int_0^{1/2}\frac{t\ln^3(t)}{\sqrt{1-4t^2}}dt=$$ $$-\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{1}{3\cdot2^{2n-1}}\binom{2n}{n}\left(\frac{\ln^3(2)}{2n+2}+\frac{3\ln^2(2)}{(2n+2)^2}+\frac{6\ln(2)}{(2n+2)^3}+\frac{6}{(2n+2)^4}\right)$$ It also might be more convenient to factor the $2$ 's from the denominators and get $$\frac{8}{3}\int_0^{1/2}\frac{t\ln^3(t)}{\sqrt{1-4t^2}}dt=$$ $$-\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{1}{3\cdot2^{2n}}\binom{2n}{n}\left(\frac{\ln^3(2)}{n+1}+\frac{3}{2}\frac{\ln^2(2)}{(n+1)^2}+\frac{3}{2}\frac{\ln(2)}{(n+1)^3}+\frac{3}{4}\frac{1}{(n+1)^4}\right)$$ It looks a bit nicer, but I still don't know how to proceed. Edit 2 : A good suggestion is to turn this integral into a form of the Beta function. This can be done a few different ways, but if we take $u=4t^2$ we get $$\int_0^{1/2}\frac{t\ln^3(t)}{\sqrt{1-4t^2}}dt=\frac{1}{8}\int_0^1(1-u)^{-1/2}\ln^3\left(\sqrt{\frac{u}{4}}\right)du$$ $$=\frac{1}{64}\int_0^1(1-u)^{-1/2}\left(\ln^3(u)-3\ln^2(u)\ln(4)+3\ln(u)\ln^24)-\ln^3(4)\right)du$$ $$=\frac{1}{64}\left(\frac{\partial^3B}{\partial x^3}(1,1/2)-3\ln(4)\frac{\partial^2B}{\partial x^2}(1,1/2)+3\ln^2(4)\frac{\partial B}{\partial x}(1,1/2)-\ln^3(4)B(1,1/2)\right)$$ At this point, derivatives of the Beta function are tricky, but they boil down to derivatives of the $\psi$ function, which I am not very strong in.
