Thanks guys!","If $X$ is a Banach space, we denote by $\mathcal{L}(X)$ the algebra of continuous linear operators acting on $X$.  Suppose $T\in\mathcal{L}(X^*)$, where $X^*$ is the dual space to $X$.  I am interested in conditions on $T$ to guarantee that it is a dual operator, i.e. so that there exists $S\in\mathcal{L}(X)$ with $S^*=T$. Clearly, if $X$ is reflexive then every $T\in\mathcal{L}(X^*)$ is a dual operator.  So we can assume $X$ is nonreflexive. It is well-known that $T$ is a dual operator if and only if it is weak*-to-weak* continuous.  However, this is not always easy to check, so I am interested in ""nicer"" sufficient conditions for $T$ to be a dual operator.  One question that immediately comes to mind is this: Question 1. Suppose $T\in\mathcal{L}(X^*)$ is compact.  Is it necessarily a dual operator? ( UPDATE :  The answer to Q1 is obviously not; see comments below.) I am especially interested in the case where $X=c_0$ and hence $X^*=\ell_1$. So: Question 2. What are some ""nice"" sufficient conditions to guarantee that $T\in\mathcal{L}(\ell_1)$ is a dual operator? Actually, I only need $T$ to be a dual operator up to finite-rank perturbation.  So: Question 3. If $T\in\mathcal{L}(X^*)$, what are some ""nice"" sufficient conditions to guarantee that $T=S^*+F$ for some $S\in\mathcal{L}(X)$ and some finite-rank $F\in\mathcal{F}(X^*)$? Note: In the context I am working, I can assume that $X^{**}/X$ is infinite-dimensional and that $X^*$ is separable. Thanks guys!",,"['functional-analysis', 'operator-theory', 'banach-spaces']"

Assume $\mathbb{E}\big[X^2\big]\leq80$. This constraint gives that $0<\sigma\leq4$. Now we want to maximise $\mathbb{E}\big[(e^X-1)^+\big]$ w.r.t. $F$ (or $f=F'$), so that the following integral is maximised \begin{equation} \int_{0}^{\infty}(e^x-1)f(x)dx \end{equation} It turns out it is maximised by choosing $\sigma=4$, i.e. the second moment is highest possible. Now consider the generalisation of this problem in the sense that we allow $X$ to be any continuous random variable and thus we try to find the maximising density or distribution function. I think this leads to the Variational Calculus problem. PROBLEM Let $F:\mathbb{R}\to[0,1]$ be a non-decreasing absolutely continuos function such that  \begin{equation} \lim_{x\to-\infty}F(x)=0 \quad \text{and} \quad \lim_{x\to\infty}F(x)=1 \end{equation} and $\exists$ $f:\mathbb{R}\to [0,\infty]$ such that \begin{equation} F(x)=\int_{-\infty}^xf(u)du \end{equation} i.e. $F'(x)=f(x)$. Now consider the problem \begin{equation} \max_{F\in\mathcal{C}^1}J\big[x,F'(x)\big] \end{equation} where \begin{equation} J\big[x,F'(x)\big]:=\int_{-\infty}^\infty(e^x-1)\mathbb{1}_{(x\geq0)}F'(x)dx \end{equation} subject to \begin{equation} I_0\big[F'(x)\big]:=F'(x)\geq0 \quad \forall x \end{equation} \begin{equation} I_1\big[x,F'(x)\big]:=\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^xF'(x)dx-1=0 \end{equation} \begin{equation} I_2\big[F'(x)\big]:=\int_{-\infty}^\infty F'(x)dx-1=0 \end{equation} \begin{equation} I_3\big[x,F'(x)\big]:=Q-\int_{-\infty}^\infty x^2F'(x)dx\geq0 \end{equation} for some real constant $Q>0$. Note that I defined $J$ and $I$'s to be functions of $x$ and $F'(x)$ only since they do not depend on $F(x)$ explicitly. I am trying to follow the Euler-Lagrange Equation (ELE) method. So my Lagrangian is \begin{equation} L\big[ x,F,F'\big]= J+ \lambda_0(x) I_0+\lambda_1 I_1 +\lambda_2 I_2 +\lambda_3 I_3 \end{equation} Then ELE reads \begin{equation} \frac{dL}{dF}-\frac{d}{dx}\Big(\frac{dL}{dF'}\Big)=0 \end{equation} Which I do not know how to compute in this case (my calculations give some non-sensical results). Also I think Lagrangian may not be correct since last constraint (with $I_3$) is inequality.

I guess I am doing something wrong or just cannot see how equation obtained from ELE would help me to find $F$. **Note: ** I think I am having problems with this because the optimal solution may be discontinuous and that is why ELE does not work.","Motivation Let  $X$ be $\mathcal{N}\Big(-\frac{\sigma^2}{2},\sigma^2\Big)$ random variable, i.e. probability density function $f(x)$ is given by \begin{equation} f(x)=\frac{1}{ \sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2} } \exp\Bigg(\frac{-\big(x+\frac{\sigma^2}{2}\big)^2}{2\sigma^2}\Bigg)\quad \text{and}\quad F(x)=\int_{-\infty}^{x}f(x)dx \end{equation} With this choice of mean and variance $\mathbb{E}\big[e^X\big]=1$,$\forall x$. Assume $\mathbb{E}\big[X^2\big]\leq80$. This constraint gives that $0<\sigma\leq4$. Now we want to maximise $\mathbb{E}\big[(e^X-1)^+\big]$ w.r.t. $F$ (or $f=F'$), so that the following integral is maximised \begin{equation} \int_{0}^{\infty}(e^x-1)f(x)dx \end{equation} It turns out it is maximised by choosing $\sigma=4$, i.e. the second moment is highest possible. Now consider the generalisation of this problem in the sense that we allow $X$ to be any continuous random variable and thus we try to find the maximising density or distribution function. I think this leads to the Variational Calculus problem. PROBLEM Let $F:\mathbb{R}\to[0,1]$ be a non-decreasing absolutely continuos function such that  \begin{equation} \lim_{x\to-\infty}F(x)=0 \quad \text{and} \quad \lim_{x\to\infty}F(x)=1 \end{equation} and $\exists$ $f:\mathbb{R}\to [0,\infty]$ such that \begin{equation} F(x)=\int_{-\infty}^xf(u)du \end{equation} i.e. $F'(x)=f(x)$. Now consider the problem \begin{equation} \max_{F\in\mathcal{C}^1}J\big[x,F'(x)\big] \end{equation} where \begin{equation} J\big[x,F'(x)\big]:=\int_{-\infty}^\infty(e^x-1)\mathbb{1}_{(x\geq0)}F'(x)dx \end{equation} subject to \begin{equation} I_0\big[F'(x)\big]:=F'(x)\geq0 \quad \forall x \end{equation} \begin{equation} I_1\big[x,F'(x)\big]:=\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^xF'(x)dx-1=0 \end{equation} \begin{equation} I_2\big[F'(x)\big]:=\int_{-\infty}^\infty F'(x)dx-1=0 \end{equation} \begin{equation} I_3\big[x,F'(x)\big]:=Q-\int_{-\infty}^\infty x^2F'(x)dx\geq0 \end{equation} for some real constant $Q>0$. Note that I defined $J$ and $I$'s to be functions of $x$ and $F'(x)$ only since they do not depend on $F(x)$ explicitly. I am trying to follow the Euler-Lagrange Equation (ELE) method. So my Lagrangian is \begin{equation} L\big[ x,F,F'\big]= J+ \lambda_0(x) I_0+\lambda_1 I_1 +\lambda_2 I_2 +\lambda_3 I_3 \end{equation} Then ELE reads \begin{equation} \frac{dL}{dF}-\frac{d}{dx}\Big(\frac{dL}{dF'}\Big)=0 \end{equation} Which I do not know how to compute in this case (my calculations give some non-sensical results).
