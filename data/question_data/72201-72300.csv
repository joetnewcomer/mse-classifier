Exercise 2.19. If $X$ is any set and $Y$ is Hausdorff, then a subset $\newcommand{\Top}{\mathsf{Top}} A ⊆ \Top(X, Y)$ has compact closure in the product topology if and only if for each $x ∈ A$ , the set $A_x = \{ f(x) \mid f ∈ A \}$ has compact closure in $Y$ . My question is essentially the following: Question. What is ‘the correct’ formulation/statement of this exercise? My problems with the given formulation are twofold: The notation $\Top(X, Y)$ stands for the set of continuous maps from $X$ to $Y$ . This doesn’t make sense if $X$ is only a set. So either we should require $X$ to be a topological space, or we need to use $\newcommand{\Map}{\mathsf{Map}} \Map(X, Y)$ instead of $\Top(X, Y)$ . When referring to “the product topology”, I assume that we identify $\Map(X, Y)$ with the product $\prod_{x ∈ X} Y$ , so that the projection onto the $x$ -th factor correspond to the evaluation at $x$ . But it is not clear to me if we’re talking about the closure of $A$ in $\Top(X, Y)$ (endowed with the subspace topology) or its closure in $\Map(X, Y)$ . I have so far not found an interpretation of the exercise which is both correct and also uses that $A$ consists of continuous maps, instead of just arbitrary ones. More explicitly, I have tried the following so far: If we let $X$ be a topological space and take the closure in $\Top(X, Y)$ , then the equivalence seems to be wrong.¹ If we let $X$ be a topological space and take the closure in $\Map(X, Y)$ , then the equivalence seems to be true; but not only for subsets of $\Top(X, Y)$ , but for arbitrary subsets of $\Map(X, Y)$ . If we let $X$ be just a set and work with $\Map(X, Y)$ instead of $\Top(X, Y)$ , then the equivalence seems to be true. This is basically equivalent to the previous point by regarding $X$ as a discrete space. While the last two formulations seem to be correct, they are not really about (continuous) functions $X \to Y$ anymore, but instead about arbitrary products $∏_α Y_α$ of Hausdorff spaces. This seems to betray the way the exercise is presented, which may or may not be intended. ¹ If we take $Y$ to also be compact, then the second condition is true for every choice of $A$ , in particular for $A = \Top(X, Y)$ . Thus, $\Top(X, Y)$ would be compact, and hence closed in $\Map(X, Y)$ (which is again Hausdorff). This would then entail that pointwise limits of continuous maps from $X$ to $Y$ are again continuous, which has the usual counterexamples.","I am trying to make sense of Exercise 2.19 in Topology: A Categorical Approach by Tai-Danae Bradley, Tyler Bryson and John Terilla.

In general category theory, we like exponential objects. Unfortunately, the category of spaces, $\top$ , does not possess all exponentials. In some instances, however, we can make things work - in $\top$ . The Tl;Dr of this question is - although things ""work"" in the pointed space category $\top_{\ast}$ too, do they work as nicely as they do in $\top$ ? Specifically, are the natural bijections also homeomorphisms? Let $X$ be a locally compact Hausdorff (LCH) space and $Y,Z$ any spaces whatsoever. Then it is indeed true that there is a bijection: $$\top(X\times Y,Z)\cong\top(Y,Z^X)$$ Where $Z^X$ is the space with point-set $\top(X,Z)$ and the classical compact-open topology. Beautifully and surprisingly, if $Y$ is also an LCH space then, topologising $\top(\cdots)$ with the compact-open topology, the above (natural) bijection is also a homeomorphism. Let $\cg$ denote the category of all compactly generated spaces, where the following definition is used: A space $X$ is compactly generated iff. "" $A\subseteq X$ is open iff. for all compact Hausdorff spaces $K$ , and $u\in\top(K,X)$ , $u^{-1}(A)$ is open"" Let $k:\top\to\cg$ be the $k$ -ification functor (it is left adjoint to the forgetful $\cg\hookrightarrow\top$ ). For spaces $X,Y$ understood in $\cg$ , their categorical product in $\cg$ will be $X\times_k Y:=k(X\times Y)$ . If we let $C_0(X,Y):=\top(X,Y)$ with the compact open topology amended as follows: A subbasis $(K,U)$ for $C_0(X,Y)$ will be replaced by triplets $(u,K,U)$ which represent: $$\{f\in C_0(X,Y):f(u(K))\subseteq U\}$$ For $U\subseteq Y$ open and $u\in\top(K,X)$ , for $K$ a compact Hausdorff space. We then define $C(X,Y)$ as $k(C_0(X,Y))$ . It turns out that the following adjunction always works (for $Z\in\cg$ ) and is a homeomorphism : $$C(X\times Y,Z)\cong C(Y,C(X,Z))$$ Which is one reason why $\cg$ is a preferred category. Now if we decide to do some algebraic topology and work with pointed spaces, some things change. We instead consider the smash-hom adjunction (except in full generality it isn't really an adjunction). To keep the post as brief as possible I'll just say (and provide reference if asked) that: Assume $a_0$ is the basepoint for a pointed space referred to as $A$ . If $X\wedge Y$ denotes the smash product of pointed spaces, then it follows from the above and a quick check that - if $X$ is a LCH space: $$\top_{\ast}(X\wedge Y,Z)\cong\top_{\ast}(Y,Z^X)$$ Is a bijection of sets. Likewise, if working in $\cg$ one can define a smash product in the usual way, except that one $k$ -ifies the product before the quotient is taken. In that context the above bijection also holds, but $\top_{\ast}$ has to be seen with $k$ -ified topology also. Moreover if $Y$ is also LCH (or everything is $\cg$ ) then there is a homeomorphism: $$\mathcal{M}\cong\top_{\ast}(Y,C(X,Z))$$ Of pointed spaces, where: $$\mathcal{M}:=\{f\in\top(X\times Y,Z):f(\{x_0\}\times Y\cup X\times\{y_0\})=\{z_0\}\}\cong\top_{\ast}(X\wedge Y,Z)$$ But is the last bijection a homeomorphism? That would ""complete the picture"" and show that everything nice about the non-pointed categories falls into nice properties of the pointed categories. I did attempt this, but it quickly felt far too hard - more of a professional matter, than one for a student new to algebraic / categorical topology. The fundamental difficulty was, given a compact-open subbasic set $(K,U)$ (or $(u,K,U)$ ) of $\top_{\ast}(X\wedge Y,Z)$ , it's not clear how to find a corresponding neighbourhood in $\mathcal{M}$ since $K\subseteq X\wedge Y=X\times Y/(X\vee Y)$ and the preimage of a compact set, out of a quotient space, isn't necessarily compact. This might be a basic stone to stumble over, but I'm not sure how to proceed. I don't even know if it's true . I would really appreciate references that confirm/deny (under certain conditions) whether or not the smash-hom adjunction is a homeomorphism. Or perhaps it's an open (uninteresting?) problem.

I would really appreciate references that confirm/deny (under certain conditions) whether or not the smash-hom adjunction is a homeomorphism. Or perhaps it's an open (uninteresting?) problem.

47,Principle of measurable choice,Principle of measurable choice,,"Consider the following principle of measurable choice: Let $X,Y$ be complete separable metric spaces and $E$ a closed $\sigma$ -compact subset of $X\times Y$ . Then $\pi_1(E)$ is a Borel set in $X$ and there exists a Borel function $\varphi:\pi_1(E)\to Y$ whose graph is contained in $E$ . (Here $\pi_1$ denotes the projection of $X\times Y$ on $X$ ). Proof. Since $E$ is $\sigma$ -compact we can write $E=\cup_{i=1}^\infty C_i$ with each $C_i$ compact in $X\times Y$ . Then $\pi_1(E)=\cup_{i=1}^\infty \pi_1(C_i)$ with each $\pi_1(C_i)$ compact in $X$ since $\pi_1$ is continuous. Compact subsets of metric spaces are closed, hence Borel. Therefore $\pi_1(E)$ is a countable union of Borel sets in $X$ , hence Borel. Fix a countable dense subset $\{y_n:n\in\mathbb{N}\}$ in $Y$ . Define $\varphi_1:\pi_1(E)\to Y$ by the rule $\varphi_1(x)=y_{n_1(x)}$ , where $n_1(x)$ is the smallest $n$ such that $$E\cap \big[\{x\}\times \bar{B}_{1/2}(y_n)\big]\neq \emptyset \quad\quad\quad (1)$$ where $\bar{B}_{1/2}(y_n):=\{y\in Y: d(y,y_n)\}\leq 1/2\}$ . This is well-defined, since $x\in \pi_1(E)$ implies $(x,y)\in E$ for some $y\in Y$ , and by density there exists $n$ such that $d(y_n,y)<1/2$ . Hence the set of $n$ satisfying $(1)$ is not empty. Suppose inductively that $\varphi_k:\pi_1(E)\to Y$ has been defined for some $k\geq 1$ . Define $\varphi_{k+1}:\pi_1(E)\to Y$ by the rule $\varphi_{k+1}(x)=y_{n_{k+1}(x)}$ , where $n_{k+1}(x)$ is the smallest $n$ such that $$E\cap \big[\{x\}\times \bar{B}_{1/2^{k+1}}(y_n)\big]\neq \emptyset \quad \text{and} \quad d(y_n,\varphi_k(x))\leq 1/2^{k-1}\quad\quad\quad (2)$$ This is well-defined, since by definition of $\varphi_k(x)$ there exists $y\in Y$ such that $(x,y)\in E\cap \big[\{x\}\times \bar{B}_{1/2^k}(\varphi_k(x))\big]$ , and by density there exists $n$ such that $d(y_n,y)<1/2^{k+1}$ . Then $(x,y)\in E\cap \big[\{x\}\times \bar{B}_{1/2^{k+1}}(y_n)\big]$ and by the the triangle inequality $$d(y_n,\varphi_k(x))\leq d(y_n,y)+d(y,\varphi_k(x))\leq 1/2^{k+1}+1/2^k<1/2^{k-1}$$ so the set of $n$ satisfying $(2)$ is not empty. Question. At this point in the proof the author says that a simple induction argument shows that each $\varphi_k$ is Borel. This is where am having issues. Since the range of each $\varphi_k$ is contained in $\{y_n:n\in\mathbb{N}\}$ , it suffices to show that each preimage $\varphi^{-1}_k(y_n)$ is Borel in $\pi_1(E)$ . Any ideas on how to show it? Thanks for your help. EDIT. I made some progress below. Any feedback is very appreciated! Define the following correspondence : $$\phi:X\to \mathcal P(Y), \quad \phi(x)=\big\{y\in Y: (x,y)\in E\big\}$$ Note that $\phi(x)\neq\emptyset$ if and only if $x\in\pi_1(E)$ . Let $B$ a closed set in $Y$ , and define $E(B)$ by $$E (B):=\big\{x\in X : \phi(x)\cap B\neq \emptyset\big \}=\pi_1\big[(X\times B) \cap E \big]$$ I claim that $E(B)$ is Borel in $\pi_1(E)$ . Indeed $(X\times B) \cap E=\cup_{i=1}^\infty (X\times B) \cap C_i$ . For each $i$ , $(X\times B) \cap C_i$ is a closed subset of the compact set $C_i$ in $X\times Y$ , and is thus compact in $X\times Y$ . It follows (as above) that $\pi_1\big[(X\times B) \cap E \big]=\cup_{i=1}^\infty \pi_1 \big[(X\times B) \cap C_i\big]$ is a countable union of compact sets in the metric space $X$ , hence Borel in $X$ . Clearly, $\pi_1\big[(X\times B) \cap E \big]\subset \pi_1( E)$ , and so we conclude that $E(B)$ is Borel in $\pi_1(E)$ . Now let $A_n=E(B_n)$ with $B_n=\bar{B}_{1/2}(y_n)$ for each $n$ . Since each $B_n$ is closed in $Y$ , each $A_n$ is Borel in $\pi_1(E)$ by the previous claim. Moreover, we see that $$\varphi_1^{-1}(y_n)=A_n\setminus \cup_{i=1}^{n-1}A_i \quad\quad\quad (3)$$ for each $n$ , and so each preimage is Borel in $\pi_1(E)$ . It follows that $\varphi_1$ is Borel measurable. Now assume inductively that $\varphi_k$ is Borel measurable for some $k\geq 1$ . Let $A_n=E(B_n)$ with $B_n=\bar{B}_{1/2^{k+1}}(y_n)$ for each $n$ . As before each $A_n$ is Borel in $\pi_1(E)$ . Let $$C_n=A_n\cap \varphi_{k}^{-1}\big[\bar{B}_{1/2^{k-1}}(y_n)\big]$$ for each $n$ . Since $\bar{B}_{1/2^{k-1}}(y_n)$ is closed in $Y$ and $\varphi_k$ is Borel measurable by assumption, we have that each $C_n$ is Borel in $\pi_1(E)$ . Moreover we have $$\varphi_{k+1}^{-1}(y_n)=C_n\setminus \cup_{i=1}^{n-1}C_i \quad\quad\quad (4)$$ for each $n$ , and so each preimage is Borel in $\pi_1(E)$ . It follows that $\varphi_{k+1}$ is Borel measurable. By induction it follows that each $\varphi_k$ is Borel measurable. Note that in $(3)$ and $(4)$ I assumed each $y_n$ to be distinct. The case of a finite dense subset can be handled in the same way.","Consider the following principle of measurable choice: Let be complete separable metric spaces and a closed -compact subset of .

Definition: A great circle of $S^n$ is the intersection of $S^n$ with a 2-dimensional vector subspace of $R^{n+1}$ And then I have proved the following two lemmas which might be helpful; Lemma 1: If $x,y,z\in S^n$ and $\theta(x,y)+\theta(y,z)=\theta(x,z)$ then $x,y,z$ are spherically collinear (Meaning that there is a great circle containing them). Here, $\theta$ is the new spherical metric given as the angle between two points that we know from our usual euclidean metric given by $x\cdot y = |x| |y|\cos \theta (x,y)$ Lemma 2: A curve $\alpha: [a,b] \rightarrow S^n$ is a geodesic arc (ie. a distance preserving function) if and only if there are orthogonal vectors $x,y\in S^n$ such that $$  \alpha(t)=(\cos(t-a))x+(\sin(t-a))y,\quad b-a\leq \pi$$ My original idea to prove the Theorem was to take any three points in the image of $\phi$ and then try to show that they must be spherically collinear, ie. they lie on the same great circle. Thus, the image of $\phi(t)$ must be a great circle, which is parametrized as above. But I am not sure this will even work.

So far, in this book, all I have been introduced to is the definitions; Definition: A geodesic line in a metric space is a locally distance preserving function . Definition: A great circle of is the intersection of with a 2-dimensional vector subspace of And then I have proved the following two lemmas which might be helpful; Lemma 1: If and then are spherically collinear (Meaning that there is a great circle containing them). Here, is the new spherical metric given as the angle between two points that we know from our usual euclidean metric given by Lemma 2: A curve is a geodesic arc (ie. a distance preserving function) if and only if there are orthogonal vectors such that My original idea to prove the Theorem was to take any three points in the image of and then try to show that they must be spherically collinear, ie. they lie on the same great circle. Thus, the image of must be a great circle, which is parametrized as above. But I am not sure this will even work. At the same time, I have a feeling I need to use the two lemmas, combining them. Any help would be greatly appreciated.","\phi: R \rightarrow S^n x,y\in S^n \phi (t) = (\cos t)x+(\sin t)y S^n n=2 X \phi : R\rightarrow X S^n S^n R^{n+1} x,y,z\in S^n \theta(x,y)+\theta(y,z)=\theta(x,z) x,y,z \theta x\cdot y = |x| |y|\cos \theta (x,y) \alpha: [a,b] \rightarrow S^n x,y\in S^n   \alpha(t)=(\cos(t-a))x+(\sin(t-a))y,\quad b-a\leq \pi \phi \phi(t)",['general-topology']

Let $\varphi: [0,1] \to [0,1]$ also be the tent map, the same as $T$ ; i.e. $\varphi\equiv T$ .

I think the argument for ergodicty does not go wrong only using semi-conjugation, but I would like to have ""full"" conjugation. This is the ergodicity argument assuming ergodicity of $E$ : Theorem. The tent map $T$ is ergodic. Proof. Let $A$ be an invariant set in $[0,1]$ for $T$ ; i.e. $T^{-1}(A)=A$ . Since $\varphi\circ E = T\circ\varphi$ with $\varphi,\ E$ and $T$ as in the lemma above, it follows that \begin{align*}     (\varphi\circ E)^{-1}&=(T\circ\varphi)^{-1}\\ E^{-1}\circ\varphi^{-1}&=\varphi^{-1}\circ T^{-1} \end{align*} which, after plugging in $A$ , gives \begin{equation*}     E^{-1}(\varphi^{-1}(A))=\varphi^{-1}(T^{-1}(A))=\varphi^{-1}(A); \end{equation*} so $\varphi^{-1}(A)$ is invariant for $E$ . Now since $E$ is ergodic, we have that $\varphi^{-1}(A)$ has zero or full Lebesgue measure. As $\varphi=T$ (and $\varphi^{-1}=T^{-1}$ ), we have that $\varphi^{-1}(A)=T^{-1}(A)=A$ and hence also $A$ has zero or full Lebesgue measure; i.e. $T$ is ergodic. $\Box$ .

But given any $c\geq 0$, $\mathbf{F}$ is always finite on  $$\mathcal{V}_{k,c}(M):=\{V\in \mathcal{V}_k(M)\,:\, \|V\|\leq c\}.$$ Indeed, for any $f\in J$, $|f|\leq 1$, $\mathrm{Lip}(f)\leq 1$, $$\int_{G_k(M)}f\,dV-\int_{G_k(M)}f\,dW\leq \int_{G_k(M)}\,dV+\int_{G_k(M)}\,dW=\|V\|+\|W\|\leq 2c.$$ Therefore, $\mathbf{F}$ is a finite genuine metric on $\mathcal{V}_{k,c}(M)$. I want to prove that: ($\ast$) The weak topology and the $\mathbf{F}$-induced topology coincide on $V_{k,c}(M)$. This $\mathbf{F}$-metric appears in several papers in the internet (generally talking about minimal surfaces) but always with its definition and the claim ($\ast$) above, followed by some sort of ""it is easy to prove"" or ""one easily verifies"". Is it really that easy? I guess I could prove that $\tau_w\subset \tau_{\mathbf{F}}$ but, given an open $\mathbf{F}$-ball $B_\epsilon(V)$, how do I find a weak-basic open $U$ with $V\in U\subset B_\epsilon(V)$? (such open must be a finite intersection of elements of $\beta$. Which $f_i$'s and real opens $I_i$'s to choose?)",,"['general-topology', 'measure-theory', 'geometric-measure-theory', 'metrizability']"

Could anyone give me some ideas about the other direction? I tried to assume a non-convergent net in $X$, but I don't see get some $f\in F$ such that the corresponding net does not converge in $Y$.",,['general-topology']

97,ANR is locally contractible,ANR is locally contractible,,"Recall that a space $X$ is contractible if there exists a homotopy $h:X\times [0,1]\to X$ such that $h$ is equal to the identity map on $X\times\{0\}$ and $h$ is constant on $X\times\{1\}$. Please help me out since I'm stuck with this question, namely, why each ANR is locally contractible. It seems that I can prove that each AR is contractible this way: Consider $A = X\times \{0\} \cup X\times \{1\} \cup \{x_0\}\times [0,1] \subset X\times [0,1]$, where $x_0$ is any point from $X$. This set is closed in $X\times [0,1]$. Define $h: A\to X$ by $h|_{X\times \{0\}} = id_X$, $h|_{X\times \{1\}} = x_0$, $h|_{\{x_0\}\times [0,1]} = x_0$. This function is continuous, we can extend it (since being an AR is equivalent to being an AE) to the whole space $X\times [0,1]$. And this will be the required homotopy that squeezes $X$ into a point ($x_0$). But similar approach seems not to work in case of an ANR. Because here I get a neighborhood $V$ of $A$ in $X\times [0,1]$ and an extension of $h$ onto this neighborhood. I can of course find an open $U\subset X$ such that $x_0\times [0,1] \subset U\times [0,1]\subset V$ (where $x_0$ is the point for which I want to find a contractible neighborhood) and consider the restriction of my extension onto $U\times [0,1]$, but the problem is that this map is not necessarily a map from $U\times [0,1]$ to $U$ (the range of my restricted extension can be larger than $U$). Can anybody please give a hint on what's going on? (a hint would be even better than a full answer).","Recall that a space $X$ is contractible if there exists a homotopy $h:X\times [0,1]\to X$ such that $h$ is equal to the identity map on $X\times\{0\}$ and $h$ is constant on $X\times\{1\}$.

We should take $\{0\}\cup\{{\frac{1}{n}\}}_{n \in{\mathbb{N}}}$. In this set every point except $0$ is isolated, so $0$ will survive after first iteration.
