1,Making cuts on a spiral so that all segments are of the same length,Making cuts on a spiral so that all segments are of the same length,,Imagine a roll of magnetic strip (about 2 cm in width) which is rolled in a roll of about 30 windings and about 10m length. The strip is about 2cm in width. The roll is put on a Rod which the user unwinds by hand and with a knife he cuts segments of about 5 cm in length. Another way of doing this would be to perform the cuts directly on the roll. The issue is that the inner windings are smaller than the outside windings thus if we make the cuts directly on the roll we come up with different length segments all around. Is their a geometrically correct way of making the cuts so that all segments will come out the same length? This is a naive visualisation of the cuts; naturally the segments will come out in different lengths as we approach the centre of the spiral. And this is how the user cuts them up until now: There should be a mathematic formula which dictates where to make the cuts directly on the spiral(the roll) so all segments comes out at the same length.,Imagine a roll of magnetic strip (about 2 cm in width) which is rolled in a roll of about 30 windings and about 10m length.

Find the length  of the wire. Answer: $400~\pi$ I am a highschool student and with my teacher's help and my own start I came to the bookish answer. The process was like you count the no. of loops to be placed around the cylinder and then multipy the length of wire in 1 loop and no. of loops to get the final length of wire. Everthing was good, it came out to be 40 loops and now the problem starts. According to my teacher and my own second start (At first I thought the same that I am thinking right now but we need to follow our teacher so that's why I stuck with his reasoning.), the length of wire in 1 loop is 10 $\pi$ cm , which is the circumference of the cylinder. My reasoning: I feel that the length of the circular loop of wire will be $2\pi (R+r)$ where R is the radius of cylinder and r is the radius of the wire but according to my teacher it is just the circumference of the circle. To try and to justify this I tried using some items I found at my home and measuring the length of 2 different wires around a cylindrical pencil holder. Although I am getting a different length each time when I change the thickness but I cannot justify this to my teacher. I tried explaining him but he says that it will be same no matter what is the radius of the wire and I cannot explain him how. He is quite understanding btw, just the thing is I don't have any formal explanation to give him and whenever I try I come back with one explanation from him in hand. He says that the wire is touching the circumference so the length will be same as that. I saw that Veritasium's recent video on youtube about the SAT circle problem and can relate this with it  which is how I came us to my reasoning part, but I still don't know if I am correct or not or the length difference is just due to rough measuring? Any kind of 3D graphic visualizations would be appreciated very much and feel free to explain a little deeply. Who is correct? Me or my teacher? How?

A car with the width of 10 meters is driving on the road towards me. Means that I have to get off the road to avoid getting hit. The car has a speed of 50 meters per second, means it hits me in 2 seconds. Now I want to calculate in which directions (Angle) I can run off the road to avoid the car in time before it hits me. Visualized: To calculate the maximum angle that I can run to escape the car, I tried the following already: Calculate the time it takes for the car to reach your current position, which is 2 seconds. Subtract the time it takes for you to reach the edge of the road when running straight towards the roadside (0.83 seconds) from the time the car takes to reach your current position (2 seconds). This gives you the maximum amount of time you have to reach the edge of the road when running diagonally towards the roadside: 1.17 seconds. For each angle θ, calculate the time it takes for you to reach the edge of the road using  ((0.5 * roadwidth) / sin(θ)) / speed If the time calculated in step 3 is less than or equal to the maximum time calculated in step 2, then you can escape the car by running at that angle. Otherwise, you cannot escape the car in time. Repeat step 4 for a range of angles to find the maximum angle at which you can escape the car. However, if I run diagonally against or away from the car towards the roadside, the car needs either more or less time than 2 seconds to reach me because I run towards or away from the car. So I would have to add that to the calculation somehow? Ultimately I want to calculate that in C++, maybe using a for loop via trial and error? Or is there a better algorithm for that?

65,Perspective geometry proof: projection of an ellipse is always an ellipse,Perspective geometry proof: projection of an ellipse is always an ellipse,,"The purpose of this question is to show that the image of an ellipse in a plane (not necessarily one parallel to the image plane), is also an ellipse assuming perspective projection. In general, a conic is described by the following equation : $$ Ax^2+Bxy+Cy^2+Dx+Ey+F=0 $$ Then the perspective projection matrix $P\in\mathbb{R}^{3\times 3}$ allows the transformation of points from the ellipse plane to the points in the image plane using homogeneous coordinates as follow: $$ \begin{pmatrix} x&y&1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} A&\frac{B}{2}&\frac{D}{2}\\ \frac{B}{2}&C&\frac{E}{2}\\ \frac{D}{2}&\frac{E}{2}&F\\ \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x\\y\\1 \end{pmatrix}=0$$ My question is how can we deduce from here that the ellipse gets mapped to an ellipse assuming perspective projection?

In any cross-section of the cylinder which passes through its axis, 50% of the area of the resultant rectangle lies within the triangular cross-section of the cone, as in this image: I have seen and been convinced by many proofs for the fact that such a cone occupies precisely 1/3 the volume of the cylinder. However, this conflicts with my (deeply amateur) intuition around this cross-section. Clearly, all the infinitely-many cross sections that could be taken revolving around the axis would be identical, with 50% of their area within the cone, this leads to the feeling that the cone occupies half the volume of the cylinder.

67,On the representation of $\sqrt{\pm p}$ in the integral basis of $\mathbb Q(\zeta_p)$,On the representation of  in the integral basis of,\sqrt{\pm p} \mathbb Q(\zeta_p),"I took another look at my previous question on proving a certain trigonometric identity related to the braced heptagon : $$\sin\frac\pi7-\sin\frac{2\pi}7-\sin\frac{4\pi}7=-\frac{\sqrt7}2$$ Around the time I posted the first question I was trying to find similar identities for higher primes $p$ in the hope of bracing larger polygons, but without success. When I took the second look it became clear that such identities exist for all odd primes because of the quadratic subfield embedded in every cyclotomic field – the roots of unity naturally correspond with the edges of the polygon to be braced. For example, with $p=11$ $$\frac{\sqrt{-11}-1}2=z+z^3+z^4+z^5+z^9\qquad z=e^{2i\pi/11}$$ and based on this I managed to find a cheap way to remove two degrees of freedom in a braced regular hendecagon using a Moser spindle: This leads in turn to an explicit braced regular hendecagon with 41 vertices and 79 edges , much better than Khodulyov's 155 .

I managed to find it using the cosine rule; draw a line between $BD$ and use this as the ""main"" length in the cosine rule. The other two lengths are $5cm$ and $CD$ . You end up with a quadratic involving $CD$ that can be solved. But I don't understand how to use the sine rule to do this. Ideas anyone?","I've been doing math for 10 years now, yet every so often I get stumped by a ""basic"" high school question. This is one of those times.

99,Condition for three mutually perpendicular planes in 3D Geometry.,Condition for three mutually perpendicular planes in 3D Geometry.,,"Let us consider three mutually perpendicular planes $l_ix+m_iy+n_iz=p_i$ for $i=1,2,3$ , where $l_i,m_i,n_i$ are direction cosines of the normals to the planes.    Since these three planes are mutually perpendicular, we have $l_il_j+m_im_j+n_in_j=0$ for $i\neq j$ .   Also we can say that $l_i^2+m_i^2+n_i^2=1$ for $i=1,2,3$ .
