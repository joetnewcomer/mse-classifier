1,Can we show that the decimal expansion of $\pi$ doesn't occur in the decimal expansion of the Champernowne constant?,Can we show that the decimal expansion of  doesn't occur in the decimal expansion of the Champernowne constant?,\pi,"This question was inspired by an answer and some comments to this question . Recall that the Champernowne constant is obtained by concatenating all natural numbers written in base 10 and then put $0.$ in front, that is, $$C_{10}=0.123456789101112131415161718192021222324\cdots$$ The question is does the decimal expansion of $\pi$ occur as a tail of this number? By which I mean is there some $n$ such that $$\pi=C_{10}\cdot10^{n+1}-10\cdot\lfloor C_{10}\cdot10^n\rfloor$$ Now it is obvious that any finite initial string of $\pi$ occurs in $C_{10}$. Not only that, it also occurs infinitely often (that's just because any finite string of numbers occurs infinitely often in $C_{10}$). Hagen von Eitzen (who's answer inspired this question) also notes that proving that $\pi$ does occur as the tail of $C_{10}$ would imply that $\pi$ is base-$10$-normal which is an open question see e.g. here , so it is very unlikely we can prove that. He also notes ""that if such a position exists [one where $C_{10}$ starts giving the digits of $\pi$] (somewhere in the middle of an $n$-digit integer, say) then the first $10^{n/2}n$ or so digits of $\pi$ turn out nearly regular and this should give rise to an unusually good rational approximation."" I tried to consider if there might be some relationship with relative algebraicity, but even in that direction little seems to be known since it is unknown even whether $\pi$ is algebraic over $e$. In conclusion it seems intuitively extremely unlikely that $\pi$ would occur in $C_{10}$, but I can't think of a proof that it doesn't. A good answer would also be a reduction of this problem to some known open problem (note that we need to reduce that $\pi$ is not the tail of $C_{10}$).

Is true that $F(s)=\frac{A(s)}{B(s)}$, where $A(s)$ or $B(s)$ are some factors of $\zeta(s)$, or even possibly $\zeta'(s)$ (the first derivative) as in the case of the von Mangoldt function?

Thanks!","I was recently working on arithmetic functions and using Perron's formula to obtain asymptotic estimates. One observation I made was that the Dirichlet series  often can be written in terms of the Riemann zeta function. More formally, let $f(n)$ be an arithmetic function and $F(s)=\sum^\infty_0 f(n)n^{-s}$ be its Dirichlet series. Is true that $F(s)=\frac{A(s)}{B(s)}$, where $A(s)$ or $B(s)$ are some factors of $\zeta(s)$, or even possibly $\zeta'(s)$ (the first derivative) as in the case of the von Mangoldt function?
