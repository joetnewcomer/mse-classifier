79,How to find a point from where three vectors originate?,How to find a point from where three vectors originate?,,"Okay so first of all I tried to make the title to sound like I understand something about mathematics, correct me if I am wrong with it. Backstory / context: I bumped into this problem when me and my friend were talking one night in discord about where my friend should order a pizza from. He then sent me a screenshot of the choices he had, but it was only showing two pizza places with distances to them, as each pizza place has some max delivery radius set. Suddenly a light went on in my head and I told my friend that if I he had sent me a third pizza place in the screenshot, I could find out where he lives based on the locations of the pizza places and the distances shown. So then he sent me a picture of a third pizza place and I got to work. I have heard about triangulation before so I thought that it would be a good idea to read about how that works, but in the end I either did not understand the idea or the idea of triangulation is basically that I ""kind of"" know where I am, but I just don't know where that location is on the map, but since I had no idea about where this said friend lived, I came into conclusion that I don't have enough data for triangulation. So the next thing I did was what felt like the second obvious one to me - I drew a circle around each pizza place with the distances as the circle's radiuses, probably because that is how they find people in CIA-style TV-shows. Well that did basically nothing, now I just had a VERY vague area where he might live aka. where all three circles overlap I guess. So on I went to the third obvious thing, which was to draw a triangle through the pizza places. I then googled about finding a triangle centroid and got pretty convincing results. I figured that since the centroid point is inside all of the three circles I drew - this has to be where my friend lives. I then sent an image of my solution to my friend ready to receive applauds. Well my solution was completely wrong. Not even close. I understand that the distances to the pizza places were probably calculated via roads and not with straight lines, so that might give me some error, but the solution of mine was too far off to blame it on error. Unfortunately I like my and my friend's privacy, so I am not going to post an image of the original problem, but instead I spend some time in photoshop and created a fake scenario: Distances are not actually meters, but pixel values photoshop gave me Green dot is the answer, or where my fake friend lives.

Backstory / context: I bumped into this problem when me and my friend were talking one night in discord about where my friend should order a pizza from. He then sent me a screenshot of the choices he had, but it was only showing two pizza places with distances to them, as each pizza place has some max delivery radius set. Suddenly a light went on in my head and I told my friend that if I he had sent me a third pizza place in the screenshot, I could find out where he lives based on the locations of the pizza places and the distances shown. So then he sent me a picture of a third pizza place and I got to work. I have heard about triangulation before so I thought that it would be a good idea to read about how that works, but in the end I either did not understand the idea or the idea of triangulation is basically that I ""kind of"" know where I am, but I just don't know where that location is on the map, but since I had no idea about where this said friend lived, I came into conclusion that I don't have enough data for triangulation. So the next thing I did was what felt like the second obvious one to me - I drew a circle around each pizza place with the distances as the circle's radiuses, probably because that is how they find people in CIA-style TV-shows. Well that did basically nothing, now I just had a VERY vague area where he might live aka. where all three circles overlap I guess. So on I went to the third obvious thing, which was to draw a triangle through the pizza places. I then googled about finding a triangle centroid and got pretty convincing results. I figured that since the centroid point is inside all of the three circles I drew - this has to be where my friend lives. I then sent an image of my solution to my friend ready to receive applauds. Well my solution was completely wrong. Not even close. I understand that the distances to the pizza places were probably calculated via roads and not with straight lines, so that might give me some error, but the solution of mine was too far off to blame it on error. Unfortunately I like my and my friend's privacy, so I am not going to post an image of the original problem, but instead I spend some time in photoshop and created a fake scenario: Distances are not actually meters, but pixel values photoshop gave me Green dot is the answer, or where my fake friend lives.

82,Intersection of any function and a circle,Intersection of any function and a circle,,"I wanted to know how to find a specific angle based on a function and a circle intersection. To understand, you first need to see the drawing : What I want is to find the smaller alpha angle possible value where the arc-circle drawn by this angle 'cut' a random function. The origin of the circle is $O(0, 0)$ and the radius is $1$ ( but I don't think the radius would impact the calcul ). I first thought about how I could find this angle if the function was linear: $y=ax+b$ . When $a \ne 0$ there are some equations : $ax + b = 0$ $x^2+y^2=R^2$ (with R the circle radius) $\cos{\alpha}=x$ $\sin{\alpha}=f(x)$ and the solutions are : $$x = {-ab \pm \sqrt{-b^2+R^2+a^2R^2} \over 1+a^2}.$$ This worked with $R = 1$ . You just have to set $\alpha=\arccos{x}$ . So I thought about guessing the intersection between the tangent of the function at the value $a.$ This gave me two equations : $y=f(x)$ and $x^2+y^2=R^2.$ The first gives that  tangent line : $y = xf'(x)+(f(a)-f'(x)a)$ . So I solved the same system and found : $$x = {-f'(x)[f(a)-f'(x)a] \pm \sqrt{-[f(a)-f'(x)a]^2+R^2+f'(a)^2R^2} \over 1+f'(a)^2}.$$ This equation is true when $f(x) = ax + b$ , because if you replace everything by those values, you get the previous correct equation. But this new $x$ value is not right and I don't know why.... Maybe there is an easier way to solve my problem... Anyway thanks for trying helping me :). Edit 1 : An algorithm will do the job too if the mathematical solution is too hard to find (I'm using Java).
