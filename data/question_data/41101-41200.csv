0,Alternative proof of : $n = \sum_{d|n} \phi(d)$ which is the sum of Euler Phi Function over Divisors,Alternative proof of :  which is the sum of Euler Phi Function over Divisors,n = \sum_{d|n} \phi(d),"Exercise : Using the fact that the number of the generators of $\mathbb Z_d$ is $\phi(d)$, show that :    $$n = \sum_{d|n} \phi(d)$$   where $\phi$ is Euler's function which is defined for every positive integer $n$ from the formula $\phi(n)=s$, where $s$ is the number of positive integers less or equal of $n$ which are prime to $n$. QUESTION : I have proved the given relation the following way, whilst studying but I am not sure whether it could be smaller or alternated, using the fact given in the exercise about $\mathbb Z_d$. I would appreciate any clarification or hint given. Let $S_d = \left\{{m \in \mathbb Z: 1 \le m \le n, \gcd \left\{{m, n}\right\} = d}\right\}$. That is, $S_d$ is all the numbers less than or equal to $n$ whose $\text{gcd}$ with $n$ is $d$. Now from Divide by $\text{gcd}$ for Coprime Integers we have: $$\gcd \left\{{m, n}\right\} = d \iff \dfrac m d, \dfrac n d \in \mathbb Z: \dfrac m d \perp \dfrac n d$$ So the number of integers in $S_d$ equals the number of positive integers no bigger than $n/d$ which are prime to $n/d$. By definition of the Euler function stated in the exercise, this is : $$|S_d| = \phi\bigg(\frac{n}{d}\bigg)$$ From the definition of the $S_d$, it follows that for all $1≤m≤n$ : $$\exists d | n: m \in S_d$$ which leads to : $$\displaystyle \left\{{1, \ldots, n}\right\} = \bigcup_{d |n} S_d$$ From the way I defined $S_d$ though, it also follows that they are pairwise disjoint. Now from Corollary to Cardinality of Set Union, it follows that : $$n=\sum_{d|n} |S_d| = \sum_{d|n} \phi \left({\dfrac n d}\right)$$ But using the fact that the sum over divisors equals the sum over quotients, we derive the formula wanted : $$\sum_{d | n} \phi \left({\dfrac n d}\right) = \sum_{d |n} \phi \left({d}\right)$$","Exercise : Using the fact that the number of the generators of $\mathbb Z_d$ is $\phi(d)$, show that :    $$n = \sum_{d|n} \phi(d)$$   where $\phi$ is Euler's function which is defined for every positive integer $n$ from the formula $\phi(n)=s$, where $s$ is the number of positive integers less or equal of $n$ which are prime to $n$.

Question: Let $A, B$ be rings (commutative, with $1$). Let $M$ be a module over $A$ and $P$ be a module over $B.$  Let $N$ be a bimodule over $A$ and $B$; that is, $N$ is simultaneously a module over $A$ and over $B$ and the operations are compatible in the sense that $(ax)b=a(xb)$ for $x\in N, a \in A, b \in B.$ Then $(M \otimes_A N) \otimes_B P \sim M \otimes_A ( N \otimes_B P).$  Here “$\sim$” denotes isomorphism, where both sides are viewed bimodules over $A$ and $B$. Attempt at solution: Step 1: For fixed $p \in P,$ define the map $f_p: M \times N \to  M \otimes_A (N \otimes_B P)$ which takes $(m, n) \mapsto m \otimes_A (n \otimes_B p).$ It’s easy to see that $f_p$ is $A-$multilinear.  Hence it induces a map $f’_p: M \otimes_A N \to M \otimes_A (N \otimes_B P)$ which is a homomorphism of $A-$modules such that $f’_p(m \otimes n) = m \otimes_A (n \otimes_B p)$. Step 2: Define now $g: (M\otimes_A N) \times P \to M \otimes_A ( N \otimes_B P)$ by $ g(x,y)= f_y’(x).$   We want to show that $g$ is $B-$multilinear. We show first that $g$ is $B-$multilinear in the first component.  Note that an element $x\in M\otimes_A B$ is of the form $x = \sum_1^{n} m_i \otimes_A n_i,$ with the $m_i \in M$ and $n_i \in N.$ Hence, for $\lambda \in B,$ we have $\lambda x_0+ x_1= \lambda \sum_1^{n_0} m^0_i \otimes_A n^0_i + \sum_1^{n_1} m^1_i \otimes_A n^1_i = \sum_1^{n_0} m^0_i \otimes_A \lambda n^0_i + \sum_1^{n_1} m^1_i \otimes_A n^1_i.$ Hence, we have \begin{align} g(\lambda x_0+x_1, p)&= g( \sum_1^{n_0}(m^0_i \otimes_A \lambda n^0_i) + \sum_1^{n_1}(m^1_i \otimes_A n^1_i) , p) \\ &=\sum_1^{n_0} m^0_i \otimes_A (\lambda n^0_i \otimes_B p) + \sum_1^{n_1} m^1_i \otimes_A (n^1_i \otimes_B p) \\ &=\lambda \sum_1^{n_0} m^0_i \otimes_A (n^0_i \otimes_B p) + \sum_1^{n_1} m^1_i \otimes_A (n^1_i \otimes_B p) \\ &= \lambda g(x_0,p)+ g(x_1,p), \end{align} where we have used the fact that $g(\cdot,y)=f’_y(\cdot)$ is $A-$linear. We can show that $g$ is $B-$linear in the second component by a similar argument.

Attempt at solution: Step 1: For fixed $p \in P,$ define the map $f_p: M \times N \to  M \otimes_A (N \otimes_B P)$ which takes $(m, n) \mapsto m \otimes_A (n \otimes_B p).$ It’s easy to see that $f_p$ is $A-$multilinear.  Hence it induces a map $f’_p: M \otimes_A N \to M \otimes_A (N \otimes_B P)$ which is a homomorphism of $A-$modules such that $f’_p(m \otimes n) = m \otimes_A (n \otimes_B p)$. Step 2: Define now $g: (M\otimes_A N) \times P \to M \otimes_A ( N \otimes_B P)$ by $ g(x,y)= f_y’(x).$   We want to show that $g$ is $B-$multilinear. We show first that $g$ is $B-$multilinear in the first component.  Note that an element $x\in M\otimes_A B$ is of the form $x = \sum_1^{n} m_i \otimes_A n_i,$ with the $m_i \in M$ and $n_i \in N.$ Hence, for $\lambda \in B,$ we have $\lambda x_0+ x_1= \lambda \sum_1^{n_0} m^0_i \otimes_A n^0_i + \sum_1^{n_1} m^1_i \otimes_A n^1_i = \sum_1^{n_0} m^0_i \otimes_A \lambda n^0_i + \sum_1^{n_1} m^1_i \otimes_A n^1_i.$ Hence, we have \begin{align} g(\lambda x_0+x_1, p)&= g( \sum_1^{n_0}(m^0_i \otimes_A \lambda n^0_i) + \sum_1^{n_1}(m^1_i \otimes_A n^1_i) , p) \\ &=\sum_1^{n_0} m^0_i \otimes_A (\lambda n^0_i \otimes_B p) + \sum_1^{n_1} m^1_i \otimes_A (n^1_i \otimes_B p) \\ &=\lambda \sum_1^{n_0} m^0_i \otimes_A (n^0_i \otimes_B p) + \sum_1^{n_1} m^1_i \otimes_A (n^1_i \otimes_B p) \\ &= \lambda g(x_0,p)+ g(x_1,p), \end{align} where we have used the fact that $g(\cdot,y)=f’_y(\cdot)$ is $A-$linear. We can show that $g$ is $B-$linear in the second component by a similar argument. Step 3: To show this is an isomorphism, we construct an inverse mapping by the same procedure.",,"['abstract-algebra', 'commutative-algebra']"

However, even for the revised version given in that link, I think there may be an error. In a comment under that post it is said this isomorphism is useful for proving some results such as a Kunneth formula so I would quite like everything to actually work! For any chain complexes $A,B$ of right and left $R$ -modules and any cochain complex $G$ of Abelian groups, it is claimed that: $$\tag{$\ast$}\tot(\hom_\Bbb Z(\tot^{\oplus}(A\otimes_R B),G))\cong\tot(\hom_R(A,\tot(\hom_\Bbb Z(B,G)))$$ As a natural isomorphism of cochain complexes. On objects I can see this: We want a map, for each $n\in\Bbb Z$ , from: $$\prod_{k,\ell\in\Bbb Z}\hom_\Bbb Z(A_\ell\otimes_RB_{k-\ell},G^{n-k})\overset{?}{\cong}\prod_{i,j\in\Bbb Z}\hom_R(A_i,\hom_\Bbb Z(B_j,G^{n-i-j}))$$ Such a map is determined by its $(i,j)$ th projections, which will be: $$\prod_{k\in\Bbb Z}\prod_{\ell\in\Bbb Z}\hom_\Bbb Z(A_\ell\otimes_RB_{k-\ell},G^{n-k})\overset{\pi_{i+j}}{\twoheadrightarrow}\prod_{\ell\in\Bbb Z}\hom_\Bbb Z(A_\ell\otimes_RB_{i+j-\ell},G^{n-i-j})\\\overset{\pi_i}{\twoheadrightarrow}\hom_\Bbb Z(A_i\otimes_RB_j,G^{n-i-j})\cong\hom_R(A_i,\hom_\Bbb Z(B_j,G^{n-i-j}))$$ Where the last isomorphism is the canonical tensor-hom adjunction isomorphism. This map is clearly an isomorphism. However, I remain entirely unconvinced that this is an isomorphism of chain complexes . Namely, the map I described above is not a chain map (as per the sign conventions Weibel uses, detailed below). Specifically, I have computed that for $n\in\Bbb Z$ and a family $(g_{k,\ell})_{k,\ell\in\Bbb Z}$ of homomorphisms $A_\ell\otimes_RB_{k-\ell}\to G^{n-k}$ , the element $\left(\sum_{\ell\in\Bbb Z}g_{k,\ell}\right)_{k\in\Bbb Z}$ of $\tot(\hom_\Bbb Z(\tot^{\oplus}(A\otimes_RB),G))^n$ is mapped to two distinct destinations: $$\tag{1}\left(\prod_{j\in\Bbb Z}(\overline{g}_{i+j-1,i-1}\circ d_i+(-1)^id_j^\ast\overline{g}_{i+j-1,i}+(-1)^{n+1}d_\ast^{n-i-j}\overline{g}_{i+j,i}\right)_{i\in\Bbb Z}$$ And: $$\tag{2}\left(\prod_{j\in\Bbb Z}(\overline{g}_{i+j-1,i-1}\circ d_i+(-1)^id_\ast^{n-i-j}\overline{g}_{i+j,i}+(-1)^{n+1}d^\ast_j\overline{g}_{i+j-1,i}\right)_{i\in\Bbb Z}$$ Both describing elements of $\tot(\hom_R(A,\tot(\hom_\Bbb Z(B,G))))^{n+1}$ . Where $(1)$ is what you get when you apply first the differential of the left hand cocomplex and then apply the isomorphism $(\ast)$ , and $(2)$ is what you get if you first apply the isomorphism of $(\ast)$ and then apply the differential of the right hand cocomplex. That is, the commutative square for $(\ast)$ to be a cochain map is not actually commutative! I've run through that calculation twice being very attentive to which sign conventions apply when, so I'm confident - but if I still somehow screwed it up and everything is fine as-is, please let me know. My questions: Can we alter the choice of levelwise isomorphism in $(\ast)$ so that this really is a bona fide isomorphism of cochain complexes? I suspect yes because it's only slightly wrong (the final two summands differ by $(-1)^{n+i+1})$ but I can't see it myself (the indexing scares me) Alternatively, is my choice of isomorphism in $(\ast)$ correct as written if you use different sign conventions to Weibel ? Note these different sign conventions should still have the nice properties such as satisfying the double complex condition. I would be unhappy if a different sign convention is truly necessary since that somewhat invalidates the material of the book. Definitions, conventions: Given a chain complex $C$ and a cochain complex $K$ in an Abelian category, Weibel defines the hom double cochain complex $\hom(C_\bullet,K^\bullet)$ to have horizontal differentials: $$d_h^{k,\ell}:=(d^C_{k+1})^\ast:\hom(C_k,D^\ell)\to\hom(C_{k+1},D^\ell)$$ and vertical differentials: $$d_v^{k,\ell}:=(-1)^{k+\ell+1}\cdot(d_D^\ell)_\ast:\hom(C_k,D^\ell)\to\hom(C_k,D^{\ell+1})$$ Given chain complexes of right and left $R$ -modules $A$ and $B$ , he defines $A\otimes_RB$ to be the double chain complex of Abelian groups $A_\bullet\otimes_R B_\bullet$ where again the differentials are twisted by a sign: the horizontals: $$d^h_{k,\ell}:=d^A_k\otimes1:A_k\otimes_RB_\ell\to A_{k-1}\otimes_RB_\ell$$ And verticals: $$d^v_{k,\ell}:=(-1)^k\otimes d^B_\ell:A_k\otimes_RB_\ell\to A_k\otimes_RB_{\ell-1}$$","The exercise from Weibel's ""an introduction to homological algebra"" is known to be incorrectly stated .

On objects I can see this: We want a map, for each , from: Such a map is determined by its th projections, which will be: Where the last isomorphism is the canonical tensor-hom adjunction isomorphism. This map is clearly an isomorphism. However, I remain entirely unconvinced that this is an isomorphism of chain complexes . Namely, the map I described above is not a chain map (as per the sign conventions Weibel uses, detailed below). Specifically, I have computed that for and a family of homomorphisms , the element of is mapped to two distinct destinations: And: Both describing elements of . Where is what you get when you apply first the differential of the left hand cocomplex and then apply the isomorphism , and is what you get if you first apply the isomorphism of and then apply the differential of the right hand cocomplex. That is, the commutative square for to be a cochain map is not actually commutative! I've run through that calculation twice being very attentive to which sign conventions apply when, so I'm confident - but if I still somehow screwed it up and everything is fine as-is, please let me know. My questions: Can we alter the choice of levelwise isomorphism in so that this really is a bona fide isomorphism of cochain complexes? I suspect yes because it's only slightly wrong (the final two summands differ by but I can't see it myself (the indexing scares me) Alternatively, is my choice of isomorphism in correct as written if you use different sign conventions to Weibel ? Note these different sign conventions should still have the nice properties such as satisfying the double complex condition. I would be unhappy if a different sign convention is truly necessary since that somewhat invalidates the material of the book. Definitions, conventions: Given a chain complex and a cochain complex in an Abelian category, Weibel defines the hom double cochain complex to have horizontal differentials: and vertical differentials: Given chain complexes of right and left -modules and , he defines to be the double chain complex of Abelian groups where again the differentials are twisted by a sign: the horizontals: And verticals:","\newcommand{\hom}{\mathsf{Hom}}\newcommand{\tot}{\mathsf{Tot}} 2.7.3 A,B R G \tag{\ast}\tot(\hom_\Bbb Z(\tot^{\oplus}(A\otimes_R B),G))\cong\tot(\hom_R(A,\tot(\hom_\Bbb Z(B,G))) n\in\Bbb Z \prod_{k,\ell\in\Bbb Z}\hom_\Bbb Z(A_\ell\otimes_RB_{k-\ell},G^{n-k})\overset{?}{\cong}\prod_{i,j\in\Bbb Z}\hom_R(A_i,\hom_\Bbb Z(B_j,G^{n-i-j})) (i,j) \prod_{k\in\Bbb Z}\prod_{\ell\in\Bbb Z}\hom_\Bbb Z(A_\ell\otimes_RB_{k-\ell},G^{n-k})\overset{\pi_{i+j}}{\twoheadrightarrow}\prod_{\ell\in\Bbb Z}\hom_\Bbb Z(A_\ell\otimes_RB_{i+j-\ell},G^{n-i-j})\\\overset{\pi_i}{\twoheadrightarrow}\hom_\Bbb Z(A_i\otimes_RB_j,G^{n-i-j})\cong\hom_R(A_i,\hom_\Bbb Z(B_j,G^{n-i-j})) n\in\Bbb Z (g_{k,\ell})_{k,\ell\in\Bbb Z} A_\ell\otimes_RB_{k-\ell}\to G^{n-k} \left(\sum_{\ell\in\Bbb Z}g_{k,\ell}\right)_{k\in\Bbb Z} \tot(\hom_\Bbb Z(\tot^{\oplus}(A\otimes_RB),G))^n \tag{1}\left(\prod_{j\in\Bbb Z}(\overline{g}_{i+j-1,i-1}\circ d_i+(-1)^id_j^\ast\overline{g}_{i+j-1,i}+(-1)^{n+1}d_\ast^{n-i-j}\overline{g}_{i+j,i}\right)_{i\in\Bbb Z} \tag{2}\left(\prod_{j\in\Bbb Z}(\overline{g}_{i+j-1,i-1}\circ d_i+(-1)^id_\ast^{n-i-j}\overline{g}_{i+j,i}+(-1)^{n+1}d^\ast_j\overline{g}_{i+j-1,i}\right)_{i\in\Bbb Z} \tot(\hom_R(A,\tot(\hom_\Bbb Z(B,G))))^{n+1} (1) (\ast) (2) (\ast) (\ast) (\ast) (-1)^{n+i+1}) (\ast) C K \hom(C_\bullet,K^\bullet) d_h^{k,\ell}:=(d^C_{k+1})^\ast:\hom(C_k,D^\ell)\to\hom(C_{k+1},D^\ell) d_v^{k,\ell}:=(-1)^{k+\ell+1}\cdot(d_D^\ell)_\ast:\hom(C_k,D^\ell)\to\hom(C_k,D^{\ell+1}) R A B A\otimes_RB A_\bullet\otimes_R B_\bullet d^h_{k,\ell}:=d^A_k\otimes1:A_k\otimes_RB_\ell\to A_{k-1}\otimes_RB_\ell d^v_{k,\ell}:=(-1)^k\otimes d^B_\ell:A_k\otimes_RB_\ell\to A_k\otimes_RB_{\ell-1}","['abstract-algebra', 'homological-algebra', 'convention']"

Prove also that this Galois group is isomorphic to the product of a countable infinite collection of copies of $\pm 1$ . My attempt : First I thought we could recognize the field as $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{\mathbb{Q}}) = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-1}, \sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}, \dots)$ . This field extension is clearly algebraic, also separable since the characteristic is 0. Furthermore this extension is normal because for any $\alpha \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{\mathbb{Q}})$ we can consider $f^{\alpha}_{\mathbb{Q}} = X^{2} - \alpha^{2}$ to see that this polynomial splits into linear factors in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{\mathbb{Q}})[X]$ . Hence, it is a Galois extension. To show that $\psi$ is a group morphism, let $\sigma, \tau \in \text{Gal}(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{\mathbb{Q}}) / \mathbb{Q})$ and let $a \in \mathbb{Q}^{*}$ . then we have that $\frac{\sigma(\sqrt{a})}{\sqrt{a}} \cdot \frac{\tau(\sqrt{a})}{\sqrt{a}} = \frac{\sigma(\sqrt{a} \cdot \frac{\tau(\sqrt{a})}{\sqrt{a}})}{\sqrt{a}} = \frac{(\sigma \circ \tau)(\sqrt{a})}{\sqrt{a}}$ . Hence, $\psi$ is a group morphism. For injectivity, suppose that $\sigma \in \ker\psi$ . Then $\sigma$ must be de identity on all $\sqrt{a}$ for $a \in \mathbb{Q}^{*}$ . But then $\sigma$ is the identity on all the generators of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{\mathbb{Q}})$ , so $\sigma$ must be the identity. Hence, $\ker\psi$ is trivial and thus $\psi$ is injective.

My problem is with Rotman's proof of the case $n=1$ , specifically the proof that $\ker k\neq 0$ . \begin{align*}   \cdots   \to   H_1(\{x_0\})   \to   H_1(X)   \xrightarrow{g}   H_1(X,x_0)   \to   H_0(\{x_0\})   \xrightarrow{h}   H_0(X)   &\xrightarrow{k}   H_0(X,x_0) \\   &\to   0. \end{align*} since $H_1(\{x_0\}) = 0$ , the map $g$ is injective;   by Exercise 5.2, $g$ is surjective (hence is an isomorphism) if and only if $h$ is injective.   The map $h$ has domain $H_0(\{x_0\}) \cong \mathbb{Z}$ and target the free abelian groups $H_0(X)$ .   If $h \neq 0$ , then $h$ must be injective (if $\ker h \neq 0$ , then $H_0(X)$ would contain a nontrivial finite subgroup isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}/{\ker h}$ ).   Now $\operatorname{im} h = \ker k$ , so that $\ker k \neq 0$ implies that $\operatorname{im} h \neq 0$ , hence $h \neq 0$ , as desired.   But $k$ , being induced by inclusion, is the map $S_0(X)/B_0(X) \to S_0(X)/B_0(X) + S_0(x_0)$ [ $S_0(X) = Z_0(X) = Z_0(X,x_0)$ ] given by $\gamma + B_0(X) \mapsto \gamma + B_0(X) + S_0(x_0)$ , and so $\ker k = (B_0(X) + S_0(x_0))/B_0(X)$ .   The proof of Theorem 4.14 describes $B_0(X)$ as all $\sum m_x x$ with $\sum m_x = 0$ ;   hence $\ker k \neq 0$ , and the proof is complete. (Original scanned images here and here .)

Note that $rs = 0$ if $r$ has an even number of terms and $rs = s$ if $r$ has an odd number of terms. Therefore $I$ has two elements. I haven't been able to prove that $I$ is a maximal nilpotent ideal, or that $R/I$ is semisimple.

98,Monic Irreducible Polynomials over Finite Field,Monic Irreducible Polynomials over Finite Field,,"Let $F=\mathbb{F}_{q}$ be a finite field (so $q=p^k$ for some prime $p$ and positive integer $k$), and let $\varphi(d)$ denote the number of monic irreducible polynomials of degree $d$ in $F[X]$. I'm supposed to show that $\displaystyle{\sum_{d \mid n} d \varphi(d) = q^n}$. I see there are previous questions about this topic and even a paper, but all (save one) seem to employ the use of the Möbius function and Möbius inversion - both topics I have not covered yet in class. There is also this answer , but it appears to hinge upon the extension having prime degree. Is there some way to show this without explicitly coming up with a formula for the number of irreducible monic polynomials of a given degree in $F[X]$? Any help would be greatly appreciated.","Let $F=\mathbb{F}_{q}$ be a finite field (so $q=p^k$ for some prime $p$ and positive integer $k$), and let $\varphi(d)$ denote the number of monic irreducible polynomials of degree $d$ in $F[X]$.

99,Determine the number of irreducible monic polynomials of degree 3 in $\mathbb F_p[x]$,Determine the number of irreducible monic polynomials of degree 3 in,\mathbb F_p[x],"Determine the number of irreducible monic polynomials of degree 3 in $\mathbb F_p[x]$ where $p$ is a prime. I'd like to start off by acknowledging that I know there are many posts relating to similar problems both on here and mathoverflow, however none address my problem. In class, my professor went over the monic polynomials of degree 2 by reasoning that there are $p^2$ distinct polynomials, the reducible ones look like $(x - a)^2$ and $(x - a)(x - b)$ for the first one there are $p$ of them and for the second one there are $p(p-1)/2$ of them, subtracting the reducible ones from the total ones gives $$p^2 - p - \frac{p(p - 1)}{2} = \frac{2p^2 - 2p - p(p-1)}{2} = \frac{2p^2 - 2p - p^2 + p}{2} = \frac{p^2 - p}{2}.$$ I'm trying to use similar reasoning for polynomials of degree three using the fact that there are $p$ irreducible monic linear polynomials and $p(p-1)/2$ irreducible monic quadratic polynomials. But I can never get the result shown here and here . My reasoning is as follows: Observe that reducible polynomials would look like $(x - a)(x - b)(x - c)$, $(x - a)^2(x - b)$, $(x - c)^3$ and $(x^2 + ax + b)(x - c)$ formed from irreducible linear and quadratic monic polynomials. For the first type where all three are distinct we can surmise that there are $p$ choices for the first, $p-1$ choices for the second and $p - 2$ choices for the third. So we have $p(p-1)(p-2)$. (is it $p$ choose $3$? Do I have to account for order not mattering?) For the second type there are $p$ choices for the square, and $p-1$ choices for the linear polynomial, so we have $p(p-1)/2$. For the third type, we have shown that there are $p(p-1)/2$ choices for the quadratic polynomials and there are $p$ choices for the linear polynomial. So we have $p^2(p-1)/2$. Subtracting these values from $p^3$ should give me what I'm looking for, which is $p(p^2 - 1)/3$. But I'm not getting that. Can someone tell me where my reasoning is wrong? Or tell me how to go about counting the number of irreducibles? (I know there are other methods of getting the answer, even more general ones, but I'm looking for a simple counting method that can help me better understand where my reasoning is wrong and help me correct it.)","Determine the number of irreducible monic polynomials of degree 3 in $\mathbb F_p[x]$ where $p$ is a prime.
