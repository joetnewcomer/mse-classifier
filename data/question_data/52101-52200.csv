4,Proving that there exists a unique f(x) given Area and arc-length of f(x) on a given interval,Proving that there exists a unique f(x) given Area and arc-length of f(x) on a given interval,,"I've been suggested to this site by some nice people at mathoverflow.net Before I get started, let me tell you a little about myself. I’m a fourth year Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Michigan, Dearborn Campus. This said, I am not a mathematician, however I do know a bit about math, and I also enjoy doing math. Please excuse any redundancies I may make and my “lack of rigor”. The problem I’m working on now is an interesting one, and it goes as follows: Suppose we have some unknown function of some real variable x, namely f(x), which is “well-behaved” on some known, finite interval, {a,b}. What is meant by “well-behaved” is that it is at least once differentiable, once integrate-able, smooth, and continuous on {a,b}. Suppose further that we are given some finite area-under-the-curve A, and some finite arc-length S. Suppose finally that we are given f(x=a) and f(x=b). The problem is this: Given the above restraints on f(x), prove that there always exists some unique function f(x) that “fits the bill”. For example: Say f(x) = Sin(x), a = pi/2, and b = pi. We know that: f(a) = 1, f(b) = 0, A = 1, S = Sqrt[2]*EllipticE[1/2] ≈ 1.9101. The problem in this case would be to prove that f(x) = Sin(x) is the only function that has the known area A, and known arc-length S. Side Note: f(x) in this case could also be Cos(x - pi/2), however, this would not constitute two unique functions, f(x). A corollary question could be posed if a proof to the first problem was given, and is as follows: Given the same criterion for f(x) as before, devise a method of determining what f(x) would have to be to “fit the bill”. That is, like in our previous example, given: A = 1, S = 1.9101; devise a method of determining that f(x) must equal Sin(x). Another Side Note: I have realized (with help from mathoverflow.net) that f(x)=(x-1)^2(x+1) and f(-x) have the same Area and arc-length on [-1,1]. Making a potentially erroneous proposition, let us say that for all polynomials of nth order P(x), P(-x) will have the same Area and arc-length on any [-c,c]. This would prove difficult to prove analytically due to the ""ugly"" expression for arc-length. While in general f(x) and f(-x) are unique functions, there must be some way of thinking about them as similar enough to ""lump"" them into one unique function... Just a thought Thank you all.

I checked it on Wolfram Alpha. However Wolfram is also telling me that the value of the my definite integral is around: 0.07972. And that's the problem. More below.

86,Looking for someone to help me along with integrating $\frac{e^x}{(e^x -1)(e^x + 2)}$,Looking for someone to help me along with integrating,\frac{e^x}{(e^x -1)(e^x + 2)},"I'm working with $$ \int \frac{e^x}{(e^x - 1)(e^x + 2)}dx $$ So, I know I'll be doing a u-sub and a partial fraction decomposition. I'll let $$ u = e^x $$ Making my equation     $$ \int \frac{u}{(u - 1)(u + 2)} $$ Then I do my partial fraction decomposition. $$ u = A(u + 2) + B(u - 1) $$ Let u = -2, $$ B(-2 - 1) = -2$$ therefore $$B = \frac{2}{3} $$ Let u = 1, $$ A(1 + 2) = 1$$ therefore $$ A = \frac{1}{3} $$ This leaves me with $$ \int \frac{u}{3(u - 1)} + \frac{2u}{3(u + 2)} $$ Where do I go from here? Do I plug $e^x$ back in for u and cancel out like terms? If I do that, won't I have to worry about the bottom of the fraction possibly being 0? Edit: Reworking without dropping the du. Let $u = e^x$ and $du = e^x dx$ Giving me $$ \int \frac{du}{(u-1)(u+2)} $$ So, if I split these, I have $$ \int \frac{du}{3(u-1)} + \int \frac{2du}{3(u+2)} $$ This gives me $$ \int \frac{1}{3(u-1)} + \int \frac{2}{3(u+2)} $$ So for the first part, I'll let $w = u - 1$ and bring the $\frac{1}{3}$ out front $$ \frac{1}{3} \int \frac{dw}{w} $$ This gives me $$ \frac{1}{3} ln | w | $$ which ultimately gives me $$ \frac{1}{3} ln | e^x - 1 | $$ Do the same for the other side, let $w = u + 2$ and bring the fraction out front $$ \frac{2}{3} \int \frac{dw}{w} $$ which gives me $$ \frac{2}{3} ln | e^x + 2 | $$ put them together and my final answer is $$ \frac{1}{3} ln | e^x - 1 | - \frac{1}{3} ln | e^x + 2 | + c $$ Does that seem correct? - Revised & correct now :)","I'm working with $$ \int \frac{e^x}{(e^x - 1)(e^x + 2)}dx $$ So, I know I'll be doing a u-sub and a partial fraction decomposition.
