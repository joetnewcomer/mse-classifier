5,How to understand orbit of size $1$ in this case,How to understand orbit of size  in this case,1,"I am a self-studying beginner in group theory, so please bear with this question which could have some simple answers. Given a $p$ -group $G$ for some prime $p$ , let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$ . Let $X$ be the set of all conjugates of $H$ . Now, $H$ acts on $X$ by conjugation. I read that there are at least $p$ orbits of size $1$ in $X$ . One example of an orbit with size $1$ is $\{H\} \in X$ . This example follows since $aHa^{-1}=H$ for any $a \in H$ since $H$ is a subgroup, and we have $\text{Orb}(H)=H$ . But I read that since $p$ is prime, that there are at least $p-1$ other orbits of size $1$ . So there should be another orbit $gHg^{-1} \neq H$ of size $1$ in $X$ . What I don't understand is how $gHg^{-1}$ could be of size $1$ under the action of $H$ .

This is my proof: we know (from a previous point of the exercise) that $\mathbb{Z}_{17}$ is a characteristic subgroup of $G$ . For Cauchy, we have that $\exists \mathbb{Z}_3,\ \mathbb{Z}_5 <G$ .

For Sylow, we have that $n_5 \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$ and $n_5 \mid 51$ where $n_5$ is the number of $5$ -Sylow in $G$ , so $n_5=1,51$ . If $n_5=1$ then the only $5$ -Sylow in $G$ is normal.

So we have $34$ elements left. At this point, I thought about two different conclusions, but I am not really sure which one is the correct one: All the $34$ elements have to be of order $3$ , therefore there are $17$ $3$ -Sylow, but this is impossible because $17 \not\equiv 1 \pmod{3}$ . So we can conclude that $n_5=1$ . We have $34$ elements, so we can have at most $17$ $3$ -Sylow (in other words, $n_3\le 17$ ), and this means that $n_3$ can only be $1$ .

Unless I am mistaken, we have that : $U_1$ and $U_2$ are homotopy equivalent to $T^2$ minus a point, and thus $\pi_1(U_1)=\pi_1(U_2)= \mathbb{Z} * \mathbb{Z}=F(\left\{a,b\right\})$, the free group on 2 generators. $U_0$ retracts to a circle, and $\pi_1(U_0)=\mathbb{Z}$. Thus by Van Kampen, $$ \pi_1(T^2 \vee T^2)= F(\left\{a,b\right\}) *_{\mathbb{Z}}F(\left\{a,b\right\}) $$ where $*_\mathbb{Z}$ denotes the free product with amalgation of $\pi_1(U_0)=\mathbb{Z}$. But this is as far as I can go in my description of this fundamental group. In a more general setting the free product with amalgation of $\pi_1(U_0)$ makes sense to me : it is simply the free product of the groups $\pi_1(U_1)$ and $\pi_1(U_2)$ with the added property that we can concatenate elements if they belong in the intersection. However in this very practical case I am unable to give any information on this product. This question , for example, gives the Cayley graph of the fundamental group. How can such generators/relations be recovered from the expression given above ? Any help would be appreciated.",,"['group-theory', 'algebraic-topology', 'fundamental-groups', 'free-groups']"

95,Subfields of a splitting field using Galois correspondence,Subfields of a splitting field using Galois correspondence,,"My question concerns the techniques for finding the subfields of a given splitting field using Galois correspondence. I still struggle sometimes with these kind of problems and thus shall ask this question applied to a concrete example. Given the irreducible polynomial $f = X^4 + 4X^2 + 9$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, we can denote its roots by $a = \sqrt{-2 + \sqrt{-5}}$ $b = -\sqrt{-2 + \sqrt{-5}}$ $c = \sqrt{-2 - \sqrt{-5}}$ $d = -\sqrt{-2 - \sqrt{-5}}$. The splitting field of $f$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ is given by $L = \mathbb{Q}(a,b,c,d) = \mathbb{Q}(a)$. The elements of the Galois-group are exactly the $\mathbb{Q}$-automorphisms of L, and thus are determined by the image of $a$. If we define $\phi_1 = Id$ $\phi_2: a \mapsto b$ $\phi_3: a \mapsto c$ $\phi_4 = \phi_2 \circ \phi_3: a \mapsto d$ Results in Galois theory yield that the Galois-group of $f$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ is the Klein four-group $V_4$, which is isomorphic to the direct product of 2$\mathbb{Z}$ with itself. Using Galois-correspondence, one can determine the subgroups of $L$. Obviously, the (non-trivial) subgroups of $G = Gal(f/\mathbb{Q})$ are $H_2 = \left\{Id, \phi_2\right\}$, $H_3 = \left\{Id, \phi_3\right\}$ and $H_4 = \left\{Id, \phi_4\right\}$. What follows is my attempt to find the corresponding subfields of L. The non-trivial subfield of $L$ corresponding to $H_2$ is given by $\mathbb{Q}(a^2)$.  This can be seen by the fact that $\phi_2(a^2) = a^2$. Now, in the same manner one could argue that it can be easily seen that $\mathbb{Q}(a + c)$ and $\mathbb{Q}(b + c)$ are the other subfields of $L$, corresponding with $H_3$ and $H_4$ respectively. Is there a more general way to determine these subfields? One strategy that sometimes seems to work (but not in this particular example), is to determine the $\mathbb{Q}$-basis of L. This basis is equal to $\left\{1, a, a^2, a^3\right\}$. Then, one can see that $\phi_2(v + wa + xa^2 + ya^3) = v - wa + xa^2 - ya^3$  for $v, w, x, y \in \mathbb{Q}$ and thus $\phi_2(a^2) = a^2$, making $\mathbb{Q}(a^2)$ the subfield of $L$ corresponding with $H_2$. If I try the same approach for $\phi_3$ for example, I don't get anything useable.
