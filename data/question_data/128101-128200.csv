As there are only six symmetries, I can write out each of them and directly verify this, but I would like to understand it at more of an abstract level. Once I generalize to an $n$ -gon, I know that it is no longer the case that every permutation corresponds to a symmetry. (For example, there are $4! = 24$ permutations of four vertices but only $8$ symmetries of a square.) For the second assertion, I believe the explanation in Dummit and Foote works, provided that I fully understand it. Say we label the vertices of an $n$ -gon modulo $n$ , so vertex $1$ is adjacent to vertices $2$ and $n-1$ , moving clockwise. Because a symmetry is a rigid motion, it needs to map adjacent vertices to adjacent vertices, so if it sends vertex $1$ to vertex $i$ , it needs to send vertex $2$ to either vertex $i+1$ or $i - 1$ . Once this vertex is chosen, the new position of vertex $n-1$ is determined and the symmetry itself is fully determined. I think this should imply that if $x$ and $y$ are distinct symmetries, then they correspond to distinct permutations of the vertices.

For the second assertion, I believe the explanation in Dummit and Foote works, provided that I fully understand it. Say we label the vertices of an -gon modulo , so vertex is adjacent to vertices and , moving clockwise. Because a symmetry is a rigid motion, it needs to map adjacent vertices to adjacent vertices, so if it sends vertex to vertex , it needs to send vertex to either vertex or . Once this vertex is chosen, the new position of vertex is determined and the symmetry itself is fully determined. I think this should imply that if and are distinct symmetries, then they correspond to distinct permutations of the vertices. But I think my logic is a bit circular here, as I'm inclined to define ""distinct symmetries"" as there existing a vertex sent to distinct places by the two symmetries.",n 4! = 24 8 n n 1 2 n-1 1 i 2 i+1 i - 1 n-1 x y,"['group-theory', 'symmetry']"

One of the exercises proves that a subgroup of a finitely generated group is not necessarily finitely generated itself. The exercises looks at the group $S\mathbb{Z}, \circ$ , the group of permutations of $\mathbb{Z}$ . Two permutations are defined: $$\sigma: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}: z \to z +1,$$ (so right-shift) and $\tau_{i,j}$ which fixes all integers, except for $i,j$ which are swapped. We then considered $G = \text{grp}\{\sigma, \tau_{1,2}\}$ (=group generated by...) and need to prove that $\tau_{i,j} \in G$ . I remarked that: $\tau_{n, n+1} = \sigma^{n-1} \circ \tau_{1,2} \circ \sigma^{n-1}$ $\tau_{i,j} = \tau_{j-1, j} \circ \cdot \circ \tau_{i, i+1} \circ \cdots \tau_{j-1, j}$ . and this shows that $\tau_{i,j} \in G$ . Now define $H = \text{grp}(\tau_{i,j} \text{ for all } i,j \in \mathbb{Z} \text{ with } i > j\}$ . This is a subgroup of $G$ which is not finitely generated. questions: is there a more direct way to prove that $\tau_{i,j} \in G$ ? the show that $H$ is not finitely generated, I thought to pick a finite number of $\tau_{i,j}$ . Then there is a largest integer $k$ that is swapped by these generators. This shows that $\tau_{k+1, k+2}$ would not be contained in this finitely generated group, so $H$ can not be finitely generated. Is this correct? Or is it possible that $H$ has other generators than transpositions?","In my abstract algebra course, I learned about finitely generated groups. One of the exercises proves that a subgroup of a finitely generated group is not necessarily finitely generated itself. The exercises looks at the group , the group of permutations of . Two permutations are defined: (so right-shift) and which fixes all integers, except for which are swapped. We then considered (=group generated by...) and need to prove that . I remarked that: . and this shows that . Now define . This is a subgroup of which is not finitely generated. questions: is there a more direct way to prove that ? the show that is not finitely generated, I thought to pick a finite number of .

98,Confusion about definition of faithful group action.,Confusion about definition of faithful group action.,,"Here are some excerpts from my lecture note: An action from a group $G$ to a set $X$ is a homomorphism $\alpha: G \to \text{Sym}(X)$ , where $\text{Sym}(X)$ is the group of bijections $X \to X$ . Equivalently, an action $\alpha$ of $G$ on $X$ can be viewed as a map $G \times X \to X$ , which we usually write as $(g,x) \mapsto g \cdot x := \alpha_g(x) \in X$ . An action $\alpha$ is called faithful if it is injective. The action of left translation of a group $G$ on itself is defined as $L_g(h) = gh$ , for some fixed $g \in G$ . This action is faithful. Am I correct to assume that the statement that $L_g$ is faithful is vacuously true, since we are restricting the domain of the action to just one element $g$ ? Or am I missing something?","Here are some excerpts from my lecture note: An action from a group to a set is a homomorphism , where is the group of bijections .

99,Extensions of $\mathbb{Z}$ by $\mathbb{Z}$,Extensions of  by,\mathbb{Z} \mathbb{Z},"Given two groups $G$ and $H$ , an extension of $G$ by $H$ is a group $K$ with a normal subgroup $N$ isomorphic to $H$ such that the quotient group $K/N$ is isomorphic to $G$ (equivalently, $1 \to H \to K \to G \to 1$ is an exact sequence). So, up to isomorphism, how many (not necessarily abelian) extensions of $\mathbb{Z}$ by $\mathbb{Z}$ are there? One obvious extension is the direct product $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$ . Another extension is the group with the same underlying set as $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$ and $(a,b) \ast (c,d)$ still defined to be $(a+c,b+d)$ if $b$ is even, but it is defined to be $(a-c,b+d)$ if $b$ is odd (or simply, $(a+(-1)^bc,b+d)$ ). This nontrival extension is the semidirect product $\mathbb{Z} \rtimes \mathbb{Z}$ corresponding to the homomorphism $\mathbb{Z} \to \operatorname{Aut}(\mathbb{Z})$ where even integers act as the identity and odd integers act as negation. The answer would be $2$ if the direct product and the even/odd semidirect product were the only extensions up to isomorphism.
