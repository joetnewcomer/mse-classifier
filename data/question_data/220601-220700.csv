Denote by $D^b(X):=D^b(\mathbf{Coh})$ the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on $X$ . Theorem: For any two comples $\mathcal{E}^\bullet,\mathcal{F}^\bullet$ in $D^b(X)$ there exists a functorial isomorphism $$\eta : Ext^i(\mathcal{E}^\bullet,\mathcal{F}^\bullet) \to Ext^{n-i}(\mathcal{F}^\bullet,\mathcal{E}^\bullet\otimes \omega_X)^*,$$ where $^*$ denotes the vector space dual. This theorem can be found in D. Huybrechts's Fourier-Mukai Transforms in Algebraic Geometry (theorem 3.12). It basically says that the exact functor $$\cdot\otimes\omega_X[n] : D^b(X) \to D^b(X)$$ is a Serre functor in the sense of Bondal and Krapanov (see here for instance). Now my question is: how can we prove this theorem? I know that this is a particular case of Grothendieck-Verdier duality, but is it possible to avoid it? My attempts: I know the classical Serre Duality (Harthorne's Algebraic Geometry , III.7), which in particular says that the theorem is true when $\mathcal{E}^\bullet = \mathcal{E}$ is a locally free sheaf and $\mathcal{F}^\bullet=\mathcal{F}$ is any coherent sheaf.

I tried to replace $\mathcal{F}^\bullet$ by a quasi-isomorphic complex of injectives (of quasi-coherent sheaves) and $\mathcal{E}$ by a quasi-isomorphic complex of locally free sheaves so I can use the classical Serre duality on each summand of the direct sum, but I'm not sure this is a way to start. If someone could give me some help I would really appreciate. EDIT: Thanks to the answer of @mayer_vietoris, I tried the following.

4,On the cruelty of really intersecting Bézier curves,On the cruelty of really intersecting Bézier curves,,"Today (4 December 2017) is my 19th birthday, and I realised I hadn't asked a question here in over a year. So this is one on an old problem: computing the intersections of two Bézier curves. In my Kinross SVG library , a Bézier curve object contains two equivalent representations of its coordinate polynomials ($x(t),y(t)$): a control point form (Bernstein basis) and a polynomial form (power basis). The control point form is used for interfacing with the SVG format; the polynomial form is used for explicit calculations, and will be the form used below. The SVG standard includes line segments (linear Béziers), quadratic Béziers and cubic Béziers, which have two, three and four control points respectively. Intersecting two Bézier curves is easy if they are not both cubic: If one of the curves is linear or has collinear control points, aligning that curve with the $x$-axis and solving a cubic equation will do the trick. If one of the curves is quadratic, the same idea can be used: perform an affine transformation that maps that curve to the graph of $y=x^2$ with $0\le x\le 1$, then solve a sextic equation derived from the (transformed) other curve. This is curve implicitisation, and NumPy (the external library Kinross uses) has both (univariate) polynomial objects and a good polynomial root-finder for the high-degree polynomials that arise, so these are rather boring cases. The interesting part is cubic–cubic intersection, where this simple implicitisation no longer works. Several techniques are available, but many are unsuitable for my purposes: Bézier subdivision/clipping, in my eyes, is an inelegant approach that also fails to be reasonably quick in refining solutions. I like my answers to be as exact as possible, notwithstanding necessary precision compromises. Homotopy solvers are overly complicated, involving a differential equation at every step, and have a bewildering array of divergent cases to handle. I once considered optimisation (minimising $(p_x(t)-q_x(u))+(p_y(t)-q_y(u))^2$, where the polynomials are defined below), but this was also seen as overly complicated compared to direct solving. A resultant computation is currently a little too taxing for NumPy, since it involves polynomials in matrices (which is just not possible). I could sidestep these problems in the future by working at a lower level though. The groebner-basis has its own tag here, and certain places like this question and this Scholarpedia article describe Buchberger's algorithm in a fair amount of detail. It is more complicated than the resultant algorithm, however, and my own tests indicate that the numbers involved blow up even for polynomials with small coefficients. This leaves the rational univariate representation (RUR). Its final stage involves univariate root-finding, which again is a piece of cake for NumPy, but so far I have not been able to fully understand how it goes from the initial polynomials to the solutions (more on this later). So I came up with my own algorithm based on the multivariate Newton's method. Suppose the two curves to be intersected are $(p_x(t),p_y(t))$ and $(q_x(u),q_y(u))$. An intersection occurs when $$p_x(t)-q_x(u)=p_y(t)-q_y(u)=0\tag1$$ The Newton iteration (from $t,u$ to $t',u'$) is thus $$\begin{bmatrix}t'\\u'\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}t\\u\end{bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix}\Delta_t\\\Delta_u\end{bmatrix}$$ where the last term solves $$\begin{bmatrix}p'_x(t)&-q'_x(u)\\p'_y(t)&-q'_y(u)\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}\Delta_t\\\Delta_u\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}q_x(u)-p_x(t)\\q_y(u)-p_y(t)\end{bmatrix}$$ To get enough starting points to catch all the roots, I take for each curve: its endpoints its points of extremal curvature its inflection points and then perform a Cartesian product of the two sets obtained. With a little fuzzing to handle cases where the linear system in the Newton iteration fails to have a unique solution, my algorithm has performed very well against the test cases I have considered. (I do not need to report tangencies or other multiple root cases, since the vector images I handle in practice have ""nice enough"" curves.) In contrast, there are few articles on RUR around. Thus my question here is: What are the exact algorithmic details of solving via the RUR, going from $(1)$ to the solutions? Bézier curve-specific optimisations may exist. I am looking for an explanation that can be implemented from the ground up using NumPy. The ultimate objective I have in mind is not just to see whether RUR is better than my Newton-based algorithm (in time or reliability), but to understand some fundamental concepts of algebraic geometry. If you want, you can explain RUR using this pair of Bézier curves I tested my algorithm against: $$p_x(t)=2+147t-342t^2+221t^3\qquad q_x(u)=1+87u-84u^2+11u^3\\ p_y(t)=17-90t+183t^2-104t^3\qquad q_y(u)=10+42u-165u^2+124u^3$$ $$1+147t-342t^2+221t^3-87u+84u^2-11u^3=0\\ 7-90t+183t^2-104t^3-42u+165u^2-124u^3=0$$ In Kinross these are represented as p = bezier(2+17j, 51-13j, -14+18j, 28+6j) q = bezier(1+10j, 30+24j, 31-17j, 15+11j) They intersect in five points ($0\le t,u\le1$) whose corresponding $(t,u)$ parameters are $$(0.053611563083829826, 0.10086541719622877)\\ (0.15646174074706343, 0.94523150924142163)\\ (0.41077722343039424, 0.88035078651205612)\\ (0.86571544618164098, 0.97134323668380174)\\ (0.96472594025254754, 0.43951554821497935)$$","Today (4 December 2017) is my 19th birthday, and I realised I hadn't asked a question here in over a year.

23,Definition of stabilizer of a point in a stack,Definition of stabilizer of a point in a stack,,"I was reading in Adeel Khan's ''A Modern Introduction to Algebraic Stacks'' and came across the definition of the stabilizer of an $R$ -valued point $x$ of a stack $X$ . My question will be about that the definition does not quite make intuitive sense to me, but let me first make some definitions. The eventual questions are bold-faced. I look at stacks as $(2,1)$ -sheaves $\mathrm{Sch}^\mathrm{op}_\mathrm{fppf}\to\mathsf{Grpd}$ in the fppf-topology, where $\mathsf{Grpd}$ is the $(2,1)$ -category of groupoids. Then, given an $R$ -valued point $x\colon\mathrm{Spec}\,R\to X$ in $X(R)$ , we define the stabilizer of $x$ in $X$ as the pullback (in the $(2,1)$ -category of stacks) $\require{AMScd}$ \begin{CD} {\mathrm{St}_X(x)} @>>> {\mathrm{Spec}\,R}\\ @V V V @VV x V\\ {\mathrm{Spec}\,R} @>>x> X \end{CD} We can also define the intertia stack $\mathcal{I}_X$ of $X$ by the pullback $\require{AMScd}$ \begin{CD} {\mathcal{I}_X} @>>> X\\ @V V V @VV \Delta V\\ X @>>\Delta> X\times X \end{CD} where $\Delta\colon X\to X\times X$ is the diagonal. Because $\mathrm{Spec}\,R$ is a set-valued stack, I can find that for any ring $R'$ , the groupoid $\mathrm{St}_X(x)(R')$ is actually the set of triples $(y,z,\varphi)$ with $y,z\colon R\to R'$ maps of rings, and $\varphi\colon x|_y\to x|_z$ an isomorphism in $X(R')$ . Now comes my question: why do we call this a stabilizer of $x$ in $X$ ? I would expect that a stabilizer consists of all the automorphisms of $x$ , in some sense. More precisely, I would expect the $R'$ -valued points of the stabilizer to consist precisely of a groupoid with objects $x|_y$ for all $y\colon R\to R'$ , and morphisms the automorphisms of these $x|_y$ in $X(R')$ . This is not what $\mathrm{St}_X(x)$ does: we get not only automorphisms, but just general isomorphisms between different restrictions of $x$ , and we only have a set, and not a groupoid. All in all, it seems like it is not completely resembling a stabilizer. Does anyone have an explanation why this is then the correct notion of the stabilizer of $x$ ? Why do we want to look at isomorphisms between different restrictions of $x$ ? When I compute the $R'$ -valued points of $\mathcal{I}_X$ , I find that $\mathcal{I}_X(R')$ is equivalent to a groupoid consisting of objects $(y,\alpha)$ , with $y\in X(R')$ and $\alpha\colon y\to y$ a morphism in $X(R')$ . The morphisms $(y,\alpha)\to(y',\alpha')$ in this groupoid are morphisms $\zeta\colon y\to y'$ in $X(R')$ such that $\alpha=\zeta^{-1}\alpha'\zeta$ . So $\mathcal{I}_X(R')$ has the automorphisms of $R'$ -valued points of $X$ as objects, and their conjugations as morphisms. This seems much closer to what I would want from a stabilizer, but this is of course not the stabilizer of a single point. We can remedy this by defining for $x\colon\mathrm{Spec}\,R\to X$ a stack $F_x$ by a pullback $\require{AMScd}$ \begin{CD} {F_x} @>>> {\mathcal{I}_X}\\ @V V V @VV \pi V\\ {\mathrm{Spec}\,R} @>>x> X \end{CD} where $\pi\colon\mathcal{I}_X\to X$ maps an object $(y,\alpha)$ to $y$ and a morphism $\zeta\colon(y,\alpha)\to(y',\alpha')$ to $\zeta\colon y\to y'$ . I can show that for a ring $R'$ the groupoid $F_x(R')$ is actually equivalent to the set consisting of pairs $(y,\omega)$ , for $y\colon R\to R'$ and $\omega\colon x|_y\to x|_y$ in $X(R')$ . In other words, $F_x$ collects all automorphisms of restrictions of $x$ to $R'$ into a set, but forgets about the conjugations (which is not weird, given its definition). Now, this seems more like a stabilizer to me than $\mathrm{St}_X(x)$ , where we also allow isomorphisms between different restrictions of $x$ . Why is this not the definition of the stabilizer of $x$ ? As an aside, via the definition of $\mathrm{St}_X(x)$ we have a pullback $\require{AMScd}$ \begin{CD} {\mathrm{St}_X(x)} @>>> {\mathrm{Spec}\,R}\\ @V V V @VV (x,\mathrm{id}_x) V\\ {F_x} @>>> {\mathcal{I}_X} \end{CD} So we can recover $\mathrm{St}_X(x)$ from $F_x$ by ''further restriction'' along the identity automorphism of $x$ . Because this is a $(2,1)$ -pullback, it is of course not purely a restriction, but it seems still like $F_x$ is a slightly more powerful stack.","I was reading in Adeel Khan's ''A Modern Introduction to Algebraic Stacks'' and came across the definition of the stabilizer of an -valued point of a stack . My question will be about that the definition does not quite make intuitive sense to me, but let me first make some definitions. The eventual questions are bold-faced. I look at stacks as -sheaves in the fppf-topology, where is the -category of groupoids. Then, given an -valued point in , we define the stabilizer of in as the pullback (in the -category of stacks) We can also define the intertia stack of by the pullback where is the diagonal. Because is a set-valued stack, I can find that for any ring , the groupoid is actually the set of triples with maps of rings, and an isomorphism in . Now comes my question: why do we call this a stabilizer of in ? I would expect that a stabilizer consists of all the automorphisms of , in some sense. More precisely, I would expect the -valued points of the stabilizer to consist precisely of a groupoid with objects for all , and morphisms the automorphisms of these in . This is not what does: we get not only automorphisms, but just general isomorphisms between different restrictions of , and we only have a set, and not a groupoid. All in all, it seems like it is not completely resembling a stabilizer. Does anyone have an explanation why this is then the correct notion of the stabilizer of ? Why do we want to look at isomorphisms between different restrictions of ? When I compute the -valued points of , I find that is equivalent to a groupoid consisting of objects , with and a morphism in . The morphisms in this groupoid are morphisms in such that .

53,How should we think about the sections of a sheaf on a scheme as functions?,How should we think about the sections of a sheaf on a scheme as functions?,,"I have to admit it is a little embarrassing that I have come this far learning about schemes without feeling like I am really comfortable with this. Suppose $(X, \mathcal{O}_{X})$ is a scheme. In fact, for the purposes of this question it probably suffices to just consider an affine scheme. What I am really wanting to know is, how should we $\textit{really}$ think about the sections of $\mathcal{O}_{X}(U)$? Or perhaps an equivalent question: How are the different formalisms equivalent? To elaborate, consider the treatment in Eisenbud & Harris. There, they treat the ""functions"" on an affine scheme $\text{spec}A$ as being elements $f \in A$ whose action on a point $p \in \text{spec} A$ (corresponding to prime ideal $\mathfrak{p} \subseteq A$) is something like $$   f: p \mapsto A / \mathfrak{p} \longrightarrow \kappa(p),  $$ with $\kappa(p)$ being the residue field at $p$. So in this sense, the sections can be thought of as functions mapping points into a different field at every point. Hartshorne begins simply by stating that the sections over $U$ are functions  $$ s: U \longrightarrow \bigsqcup_{p \in U} A_{\mathfrak{p}} $$ which satisy certain localness properties. This formalism of Hartshorne seems very analogous to the construction of the sheaf associated to a presheaf. Indeed that construction does exactly the same thing: You consider maps from the open sets into the disjoint union of stalks and impose certain localness conditions. So is the sheaf that Harthshorne defines for affine schemes somehow the sheafification on something much more simple? So how exactly are all these ideas tied together? I feel like something is not really clicking. When we talk about a section of $\mathcal{O}_{X}(U)$, what is this object $\textit{really}$? As a function, what does it do? How does the collection of these functions give rise to the sections of bundles of germs as in Harthsorne? I've tagged this as a soft question since I'm not really sure it has a concrete answer beyond an intuitive explanation.","I have to admit it is a little embarrassing that I have come this far learning about schemes without feeling like I am really comfortable with this.

The question in Hartshorne is to find the ideal of the projective closure of the twisted cubic parameterized by $(t,t^2,t^3)$ over some field $k$, and show it's not the same as projectivizing the generators of the twisted cubic's ideal in affine space. All of this is well and good and I've done this with only minimal struggling. The problem is that at the end, I had to make a sort of leap of faith. By this I mean, I wrote down the projectivizations, and I could visualize that the equations I had written down were not going to cut out the twisted cubic as I wanted it by looking at the appropriate affine piece. I needed one more equation, which I was able to deduce, and then include, and convince myself that this was the projective closure. This is highly unsatisfying, because at the end of the day I had to consult my ability to visualize a variety, rather than just doing algebra, and I would like to be able to do this in general. In Hartshorne, we prove that $I(\bar{Y}) = \beta(I(Y))$ where $\beta$ is the projectivization map.

The solution is to mimic what we see when we stand on the plane and see parallel train tracks on the ground: add ""points at infinity""/""at the horizon"" (using the language of perspective in art ), one in each possible direction of a line. By construction, all lines have 1 intersection (the ""correct number""). In higher dimensions, the construction is still to add a point at infinity for every possible direction of a line, so that all parallel lines of that direction intersect once at that newly added point at infinity. I also understand that another major part of projective spaces is projective duality. Still, this is about linear things (affine linear subspaces). What I'm bothered by is the apparent miracle, that spaces constructed to make linear things work well (e.g. the initial motivation of making sure parallel lines intersect, or the ""richer"" observation of duality), somehow work well for many other things. For example, in the simplest non-trivial example of conic sections, with these extra points at infinity, all the conic sections now look like simple loops! Is there any intuition that tells us why making things nice for lines, also makes everything else nice too? (I'm aware that another point brought up is that projective spaces are compact , and hence projective spaces will have the nice properties that compactness bestows. But there are many ways of making affine space compact, so again it's not clear why this specific compactification is so magical.) Some further remarks/""analogies"" to better contextualize my question, and to paint a picture of what type of answer I might be looking for: I'm reminded of a similar phenomenon for algebraic closedness of $\mathbb C$ : adding in the points needed to solve quadratic equations over $\mathbb R$ , somehow we get enough to solve all polynomial equations! With the technology of Galois and group theory , we see that this miracle boils down to (1) Every polynomial of odd degree in $\mathbb{R}[X]$ has a root in $\mathbb{R}$ . (2) Every polynomial of degree 2 in $\mathbb{C}[X]$ has a root in $\mathbb{C}$ . (or as a comment pointed out, and explained in this answer , further reduced to just the fact that $\mathbb R$ is a ""ordered field in which every positive element has a square root and every odd degree polynomial has a root""). Although still an amazing fact, these answers investigate the miracle piece by piece and lay out clearly the foundational facts on which standard machinery (which one can develop completely independent of the miracle) can produce the result. I'm also reminded of examples of limits in multivariable calculus where approaching along straight lines things are fine, but along polynomial or other curves, the limit doesn't exist. So somehow lines are ""enough"" for projective spaces, but not ""enough"" for even basic limits in multiple variables. Of course the ""analogy"" is bad, but I write it to point out it's reasonable to expect that a situation which works well for lines may not work well at all for higher degree polynomials. ( cross posted to MO ) EDIT 2/7/24: I've been reading the book Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms and in particular the proof of Bezout's theorem using resultants. The fundamental difference between ordinary polynomials and homogeneous polynomials is that the resultant for the latter, with $f$ of degree $n$ and $g$ of degree $m$ , has degree exactly $mn$ , whereas the resultant for ordinary polynomials may have ""perfect cancellation"" and end up with a lower degree than $mn$ . For example, taking the resultant of $f=y^{2}+\left(2\sqrt{3}x-2\sqrt{3}\right)y+3x^{2}+2x$ and $g=\left(1+\epsilon \right)y^{2}+\left(2\sqrt{3}x-\left(4-2\sqrt{3}\right)\right)y+\left(3x^{2}-\left(4\sqrt{3}+2\right)x\right)=0$ is degree $2$ for $\epsilon=0$ , but otherwise degree $4$ (the expected number). So somehow homogeneous polynomials are better algebraically behaved, perhaps captured by the idea of ""grading"" (e.g. for a homogeneous polynomial in $k[x,y,z]$ of degree $d$ , the coefficients (in $k[x,y]$ ) of all $z^k$ terms is guaranteed to be a homogeneous polynomial in $k[x,y]$ of degree $d-k$ ). Also, geometrically, it seems like ""generically"" (in the sense of $\epsilon$ -perturbations of the coefficients like I did above) we get the correct counts over $\mathbb C$ , and bringing $\epsilon \searrow 0$ , the only issue is that some intersection points run away to infinity. So yes it is an issue with the noncompactness of affine space. But the reason lines suffice is somehow that when intersection points run away in this setting, they run away ""polynomially"" and that is well-behaved enough that having an observer standing one unit in a new orthogonal direction looking ""down at the 2D-ground"" their line of sight following the point running away doesn't move so much, and in fact converges to a horizon tal line of sight. E.g. the point can not run off to infinity an any wild oscillatory/spiral path (in those situations the line of sight would not converge). This heuristic seems to be supported by Bezout's theorem itself, since Bezout's theorem tells us that algebraic curves can not have infinite oscillations or spirals. However, I still feel like these 2 reasons (algebraic and geometric) that I have provided are somewhat artificial. It does not give the air of some beautiful philosophy about the ""true nature""/""soul"" of projective space. A friend also pointed out that perhaps there is a ""good reason"" that things intersect at all in projective space: Reference request for the dimension of intersection of affine varieties tells us that if the intersection of 2 varieties over affine space intersect once, then they do so ""many times"" (with a lower bound on the dimension of the intersection space). Projective space extends curves in affine space to be ""cones"" intersecting at a point (that is by construction fundamentally what projective space does: project everything through one point ), and so now the intersection theorem applies and tells us we should have one line of intersection, corresponding to a point of intersection in projective space. This I think is a pretty substantial part, but of course it doesn't say anything about capturing all the intersections, just at least one.","The (real) projective plane is often motivated by the issue of lines in having exactly one intersection, except in the case of parallel lines.

(I'm aware that another point brought up is that projective spaces are compact , and hence projective spaces will have the nice properties that compactness bestows. But there are many ways of making affine space compact, so again it's not clear why this specific compactification is so magical.) Some further remarks/""analogies"" to better contextualize my question, and to paint a picture of what type of answer I might be looking for: I'm reminded of a similar phenomenon for algebraic closedness of : adding in the points needed to solve quadratic equations over , somehow we get enough to solve all polynomial equations! With the technology of Galois and group theory , we see that this miracle boils down to (1) Every polynomial of odd degree in has a root in . (2) Every polynomial of degree 2 in has a root in . (or as a comment pointed out, and explained in this answer , further reduced to just the fact that is a ""ordered field in which every positive element has a square root and every odd degree polynomial has a root""). Although still an amazing fact, these answers investigate the miracle piece by piece and lay out clearly the foundational facts on which standard machinery (which one can develop completely independent of the miracle) can produce the result. I'm also reminded of examples of limits in multivariable calculus where approaching along straight lines things are fine, but along polynomial or other curves, the limit doesn't exist. So somehow lines are ""enough"" for projective spaces, but not ""enough"" for even basic limits in multiple variables. Of course the ""analogy"" is bad, but I write it to point out it's reasonable to expect that a situation which works well for lines may not work well at all for higher degree polynomials. ( cross posted to MO ) EDIT 2/7/24: I've been reading the book Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms and in particular the proof of Bezout's theorem using resultants. The fundamental difference between ordinary polynomials and homogeneous polynomials is that the resultant for the latter, with of degree and of degree , has degree exactly , whereas the resultant for ordinary polynomials may have ""perfect cancellation"" and end up with a lower degree than . For example, taking the resultant of and is degree for , but otherwise degree (the expected number). So somehow homogeneous polynomials are better algebraically behaved, perhaps captured by the idea of ""grading"" (e.g. for a homogeneous polynomial in of degree , the coefficients (in ) of all terms is guaranteed to be a homogeneous polynomial in of degree ). Also, geometrically, it seems like ""generically"" (in the sense of -perturbations of the coefficients like I did above) we get the correct counts over , and bringing , the only issue is that some intersection points run away to infinity. So yes it is an issue with the noncompactness of affine space. But the reason lines suffice is somehow that when intersection points run away in this setting, they run away ""polynomially"" and that is well-behaved enough that having an observer standing one unit in a new orthogonal direction looking ""down at the 2D-ground"" their line of sight following the point running away doesn't move so much, and in fact converges to a horizon tal line of sight. E.g. the point can not run off to infinity an any wild oscillatory/spiral path (in those situations the line of sight would not converge). This heuristic seems to be supported by Bezout's theorem itself, since Bezout's theorem tells us that algebraic curves can not have infinite oscillations or spirals. However, I still feel like these 2 reasons (algebraic and geometric) that I have provided are somewhat artificial. It does not give the air of some beautiful philosophy about the ""true nature""/""soul"" of projective space. A friend also pointed out that perhaps there is a ""good reason"" that things intersect at all in projective space: Reference request for the dimension of intersection of affine varieties tells us that if the intersection of 2 varieties over affine space intersect once, then they do so ""many times"" (with a lower bound on the dimension of the intersection space). Projective space extends curves in affine space to be ""cones"" intersecting at a point (that is by construction fundamentally what projective space does: project everything through one point ), and so now the intersection theorem applies and tells us we should have one line of intersection, corresponding to a point of intersection in projective space. This I think is a pretty substantial part, but of course it doesn't say anything about capturing all the intersections, just at least one.","\mathbb R^2 \mathbb C \mathbb R \mathbb{R}[X] \mathbb{R} \mathbb{C}[X] \mathbb{C} \mathbb R f n g m mn mn f=y^{2}+\left(2\sqrt{3}x-2\sqrt{3}\right)y+3x^{2}+2x g=\left(1+\epsilon \right)y^{2}+\left(2\sqrt{3}x-\left(4-2\sqrt{3}\right)\right)y+\left(3x^{2}-\left(4\sqrt{3}+2\right)x\right)=0 2 \epsilon=0 4 k[x,y,z] d k[x,y] z^k k[x,y] d-k \epsilon \mathbb C \epsilon \searrow 0","['algebraic-geometry', 'soft-question', 'intuition', 'math-history', 'projective-space']"

Let's fix $\overline{k}$ an algebraic closure of $k$ and $k_s$ a separable closure of $k$ sitting inside $\bar{k}$ . Let $\overline{X}$ be the scheme $X \times_{\mathrm{Spec}(k)} \mathrm{Spec}(k_s)$ . Then lemma 5.6.2 states the following: Given a finite étale cover $\overline{Y} \to \overline{X}$ , there exists a finite subextension $L|k$ of $k_s$ , and an étale cover $Y_L$ of $X_L := X_k \times_{\mathrm{Spec}(L)}\mathrm{Spec}(k_s)$ , such that $\overline{Y} \cong Y_L \times_{\mathrm{Spec}(L)}\mathrm{Spec}(k_s)$ I interpret this lemma in the following way: since $k_s$ is the union of its finite subextensions, then $\mathrm{Spec}(k_s)$ can be viewed as the projective limit of the schemes $\mathrm{Spec}(L)$ where $L$ runs over the finite subextensions of $k_s$ . The lemma then says that any finite étale cover of $\overline{X}$ actually comes from an étale cover of a subextension. The proof goes this way: Since $X$ is quasi-compact, cover it by a finite number of affines $U_i = \mathrm{Spec}(A_i)$ . Pullback these affines to $k_s$ to get a cover $\overline{U_i} = \mathrm{Spec}(A_i \otimes_k k_s)$ of $\overline{X}$ . Now if $f : \overline{Y} \to \overline{X}$ is a finite etale morphism, then $f^{-1}(\overline{U}_i) = \mathrm{Spec}(B_i)$ where $B_i$ is some finite $A_i \otimes_{k} k_s$ algebra, so we can write $\mathrm{Spec}(B_i)$ as a quotient of $(A_i \otimes_k k_s)[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ . Now the author claims that this quotient is generated by a finite number of polynomials. And that's where I am starting to have doubts. That would certainly be true if $A_i \otimes_k k_s$ were a noetherian ring, but with the given hypothesis, $A_i \otimes_k k_s$ is just an integral ring over $k_s$ , so it has no reason to be noetherian, that would also be true if $B_i$ was of finite presentation over $k_s$ . Going on with that, the author takes a finite number of polynomials generating all of these algebras, and then take the subextenstion of $k_s$ generated by their coefficient. The author then claims the same can be done on the overlaps $U_i \cap U_j$ and that the isomorphisms $\overline{Y}_{U_i} \times_{X_i} \overline{Y}_{U_j} \cong \overline{Y}_{U_i \cap U_j}$ is defined by a finite number of equations, and that by taking an extension generated by the coefficients, we are done. Once again, I have doubts, to me, it is not clear that the overlaps are defined by a finite number of equations. I have looked in EGA, and EGA $IV_4$ 17.7.8 (plus EGA $IV_3$ 8.10.5 (x) for finiteness) states basically this lemma (that one can descend an etale morphism of a projective limit to an etale morphism at some index of the limit), but under the assumption that the morphisms of the components of the limit to the base schemes are of finite presentation. I have the feeling that this is a crucial hypothesis that have been forgotten in Szamuely's lemma, since in that case then indeed at least the ideals giving the $B_i$ 's would be finitely generated. So, first question : am I right in assuming that this hypothesis have been forgotten or is there some point that I missed? Secondly: even in the case of finite presentation, the part concerning the overlaps of the $\overline{Y}_{U_i}$ is unclear to me. If the intersection $U_i \cap U_j$ is affine or just quasi-compact, then it is clear using the same method as above (writing it all in terms of a finite number of polynomial or covering by a finite number of things that can be written in terms of a finite number of polynomial, then taking the subextension generated by all the coefficients). But that would need some separation or quasi-separation hypothesis on $X$ . The morphism $f$ is affine since it's finite, so it is separated, so that much might be useful when dealing with the inverse image of the intersection $\overline{U_i} \times_{\overline{X_i}} \overline{U_j}$ . But without some separation hypothesis, I do not see how to phrase the fact the the $\overline{Y}_{U_i}$ are compatible on the overlaps $U_i \cap U_j$ only using a finite number of coefficients, though it is surely possible since the proposition in EGA do not need such hypothesis. Edit : I looked up in SGA I, there are no equivalent of lemma 5.6.2 in there. Szamuely's lemma 5.6.2 is used in the proof of the homotopy exact sequence for the etale fundamental group, which is SGA I IX 6.1. The hypotheses in SGA are the same as Szamuely's. So I might really be missing something here. The proof in SGA uses the fact that $\pi_1(\overline{X}, \overline{s}) = \varprojlim\pi_1(X_L, \overline{s_L})$ , claiming this is essentially the fact that an étale cover of $\overline{X}$ comes from an étale cover of some $\overline{X}_L$ for sufficiently large $L$ . Sadly for me, this fact is left to the reader in SGA I. Edit 2: After some reflexion, I think that $f$ being locally of finite presentation (since it is etale) is enough to at least claim that each of the affines $\mathrm{Spec}(B_i)$ can be covered by a finite number spectras of $A_i \otimes_k k_s$ -algebras of finite presentation, and so we can get away with ""finitary"" data as wanted. I still need to see if this work on the overlaps. Edit 3: Thanks to KReiser, the fact that the ideals defining $B_i$ is finitely generated is solved. The compatibility on overlaps remains open. On the confusing side, the homotopy exact sequence is stated in the Stacks Project ( https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0BTX ) with the additionnal assumption that $X$ is quasi-separated, which would solve the issue (see the comments in KReiser's answer), so there might be a forgotten hypothesis in Szamuely's book (but then also in SGA), and I don't know what to believe anymore.","I am working with Tamas Szamuely's book ""Galois groups and Fundamental groups"", and there is a point I am unsure in the proof of Lemma 5.6.2 The context is the following: is a quasi-compact and geometrically integral scheme (I think the second assumption might be irrelevant to the lemmma) over a field .

I have looked in EGA, and EGA 17.7.8 (plus EGA 8.10.5 (x) for finiteness) states basically this lemma (that one can descend an etale morphism of a projective limit to an etale morphism at some index of the limit), but under the assumption that the morphisms of the components of the limit to the base schemes are of finite presentation. I have the feeling that this is a crucial hypothesis that have been forgotten in Szamuely's lemma, since in that case then indeed at least the ideals giving the 's would be finitely generated. So, first question : am I right in assuming that this hypothesis have been forgotten or is there some point that I missed? Secondly: even in the case of finite presentation, the part concerning the overlaps of the is unclear to me. If the intersection is affine or just quasi-compact, then it is clear using the same method as above (writing it all in terms of a finite number of polynomial or covering by a finite number of things that can be written in terms of a finite number of polynomial, then taking the subextension generated by all the coefficients). But that would need some separation or quasi-separation hypothesis on . The morphism is affine since it's finite, so it is separated, so that much might be useful when dealing with the inverse image of the intersection . But without some separation hypothesis, I do not see how to phrase the fact the the are compatible on the overlaps only using a finite number of coefficients, though it is surely possible since the proposition in EGA do not need such hypothesis. Edit : I looked up in SGA I, there are no equivalent of lemma 5.6.2 in there. Szamuely's lemma 5.6.2 is used in the proof of the homotopy exact sequence for the etale fundamental group, which is SGA I IX 6.1. The hypotheses in SGA are the same as Szamuely's. So I might really be missing something here. The proof in SGA uses the fact that , claiming this is essentially the fact that an étale cover of comes from an étale cover of some for sufficiently large . Sadly for me, this fact is left to the reader in SGA I. Edit 2: After some reflexion, I think that being locally of finite presentation (since it is etale) is enough to at least claim that each of the affines can be covered by a finite number spectras of -algebras of finite presentation, and so we can get away with ""finitary"" data as wanted. I still need to see if this work on the overlaps. Edit 3: Thanks to KReiser, the fact that the ideals defining is finitely generated is solved. The compatibility on overlaps remains open. On the confusing side, the homotopy exact sequence is stated in the Stacks Project ( https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0BTX ) with the additionnal assumption that is quasi-separated, which would solve the issue (see the comments in KReiser's answer), so there might be a forgotten hypothesis in Szamuely's book (but then also in SGA), and I don't know what to believe anymore.","X k \overline{k} k k_s k \bar{k} \overline{X} X \times_{\mathrm{Spec}(k)} \mathrm{Spec}(k_s) \overline{Y} \to \overline{X} L|k k_s Y_L X_L := X_k \times_{\mathrm{Spec}(L)}\mathrm{Spec}(k_s) \overline{Y} \cong Y_L \times_{\mathrm{Spec}(L)}\mathrm{Spec}(k_s) k_s \mathrm{Spec}(k_s) \mathrm{Spec}(L) L k_s \overline{X} X U_i = \mathrm{Spec}(A_i) k_s \overline{U_i} = \mathrm{Spec}(A_i \otimes_k k_s) \overline{X} f : \overline{Y} \to \overline{X} f^{-1}(\overline{U}_i) = \mathrm{Spec}(B_i) B_i A_i \otimes_{k} k_s \mathrm{Spec}(B_i) (A_i \otimes_k k_s)[x_1,\ldots,x_n] A_i \otimes_k k_s A_i \otimes_k k_s k_s B_i k_s k_s U_i \cap U_j \overline{Y}_{U_i} \times_{X_i} \overline{Y}_{U_j} \cong \overline{Y}_{U_i \cap U_j} IV_4 IV_3 B_i \overline{Y}_{U_i} U_i \cap U_j X f \overline{U_i} \times_{\overline{X_i}} \overline{U_j} \overline{Y}_{U_i} U_i \cap U_j \pi_1(\overline{X}, \overline{s}) = \varprojlim\pi_1(X_L, \overline{s_L}) \overline{X} \overline{X}_L L f \mathrm{Spec}(B_i) A_i \otimes_k k_s B_i X",['algebraic-geometry']

I've got a bunch of relatively simple examples I've worked out myself. The problem is that because they are so simple, I feel like I do not have the tools to compute such groups in general, thus I'd like to see a small collection of examples that illustrate the general method of computing these groups. Here are the examples I've worked out. Example 1: Affine space. In this example, we know that every irreducible codimension $1$ subvariety $C$ of the affine space is defined by a single equation. So we can write $\mathfrak{U}_C = (F)$ for some polynomial $F \in k[x_1, ... , x_n]$. Thus $C = \operatorname{div} F$, and so every prime divisor is principle. But every divisor is a sum of prime divisors, and so every divisor $D = \sum C_i$ is the divisor $\operatorname{div}(\prod f_i)$. Thus every divisor is principle, and so the divisor class group is just the trivial group. Uninteresting. Example 2: Projective space. Here is is also true that every irreducible codimension $1$ subvariety $C$ is given by a single equation, now this equation is homogeneous. Let's again call it $F$.  Now if $F$ has degree $k$ then in affine chart $U_i$, then $\mathfrak{a}_C = (F/T_i^k)$ where the $T_i$ are the variables in projective space (this is the notation of Shafarevich, I'm not sure if it's standard). Now given an $f \in k(\mathbb{P}^n)$, we write $f = F/G$ for some forms $F$ and $G$ of equal degree. We can factor them into irreducibles, $F = \prod H_i^{k_i}$ and $G = \prod L_j^{m_j}$. Then for each $H_i$ or $L_j$, we can find an associated divisor $C_i$ and $D_j$ respectively, and then $\operatorname{div} f = \sum k_i C_i - \sum m_j D_j$. In this case, it is not hard to show that the principle divisors are exactly those for which the degree of the divisor is $0$. From this it will follow that the divisor class of group of projective space is $\mathbb{Z}$. This is at least a little more interesting. I also think I know how to treat products - at the very least I can do products of projective spaces - and I think a similar kind of reasoning will work in general. I guess the main problem I have when trying to compute the Picard group is that it seems really hard on more general varieties to figure out what the principle divisors are. Also, given only the equation(s) of the variety, it seems like the set of divisors itself is really huge, since I can probably drum up any number of codimension $1$ subvarieties just by taking intersections with different hypersurfaces, or even just hyperplanes. So what would be really great is if someone could give me some strategies for how to work this group out, and maybe a few worked examples of slightly less trivial cases. I imagine that like most things in algebraic geometry, things get hairy with things more complicated than curves or surfaces with degrees more than $2$ or $3$, but even those would suffice for me. If someone has got some notes online containing some examples, that would also be just fine.

If not what is going on?","I am fairly inexperienced with elliptic curves so there might be aspects of my question that may need better wording but let me know if there are any issues: Question: Say I have an elliptic curve over $\mathbb{F}_7$ and this curve has 12 points. I take a subgroup of size 3 and I quotient the curve by that subgroup. Magma and Sage can easily tell me the equation of the curve where the quotient lives. Not surprisingly, extra points pop up when taking a quotient that where not defined over $\mathbb{F}_7$ but become defined over $\mathbb{F}_7$ when you take the quotient. So the curve they spit out may (and usually does according to my random sample) still have 12 points. What is happening on the function field side? Is the function field of the original curve an extension of the function field of the other curve? If not what is going on?",,"['algebraic-geometry', 'elliptic-curves', 'function-fields']"
96,Hypersurfaces meet everything of dimension at least 1 in projective space,Hypersurfaces meet everything of dimension at least 1 in projective space,,"The following exercise is taken from ravi vakil's notes on algebraic geometry. Suppose $X$ is a closed subset of $\mathbb{P}^n_k$ of dimension at least $1$, and $H$ is a nonempty hypersurface in $\mathbb{P}^n_k$. Show that $H\cap X \ne \emptyset$. The clue suggests to consider the cone over $X$. I'm stuck on this and I realized that i'm at this point again where i'm not sure how a neat formal proof of this should look like. Thoughts: Does a hypersurface in projective space mean $H=V_+(f)$, the homogeneous primes not containing $f$? If $X \hookrightarrow Proj(S_{\bullet})$ is a closed embedding then it corresponds (before taking $Proj$(-)) to a surjection of graded rings $S_{\bullet} \to R_{\bullet}=S_{\bullet}/I_+(X)$ where $I_+(X)$ is the set of all homogeneous elements vanishing on $X$. The cone $C(X)$ over a $X$ is then obtained by taking the $Spec(-)$ of this morphism $C(X) \hookrightarrow Spec(S_{\bullet})$. Is that right? How can this help me prove the theorem above? I got the feeling so far that there's a very elegant way to describe all hypersurfaces in terms of vanishing of global sections of line bundles. This would help me enourmously since it would enable me to carry my geometric intuition to this setting. In this context the statement would look like: A global section of a non-trivial line bundle on projective space must have a zero on all zariski closed subsets. This is the same as saying that a nontrivial line bundle on projective space restricts to a nontrivial line bundle on all closed subspaces. And here I have a cohomology problem that feels pretty specific and managable, This all feels much less ambiguous to me than ""take the cone over $X$"". Clarifying this would help me a lot.","The following exercise is taken from ravi vakil's notes on algebraic geometry.
