1,Why left multiplication when it comes to Markov chains?,Why left multiplication when it comes to Markov chains?,,"When working with Markov chains and transition matrices $P$ we multiply from the left, meaning that for example $\mu^{(n)} = \mu^{(0)}P^n$ or that the stationary distribution satisfies $\pi = \pi P$. Especially for the stationary distribution this means that $\pi$ is a left eigenvector of the transition matrix $P$. Why do we do this left multiplication? Is it just a convention or are there any other reasons why this is done? I couldn't think of an intuitive explanation. In my opinion, it seems more intuitive to do $\mu^{(n)} = P'^n\mu{(0)}$ and treat $\pi$ as a (normal/right) eigenvector $\pi = P' \pi$.

Is it true that $$ \|(A + C)^{1/2} - (B + C)^{1/2}\| \leq \|A^{1/2} - B^{1/2}\|,$$ in either the 2 or Frobenius norm? It is clearly true when $A, B$ and $C$ commute, but the general case is less clear to me. In fact, even the particular case $B = 0$ does not seem obvious. Without loss of generality, it is clear that we can assume that $C$ is diagonal. We show that it is sufficient to prove to prove the inequality for the matrix with zeros everywhere except on any position $k$ on the diagonal, $$ (C_k)_{ij} = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } i=j=k\\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} $$ Clearly,  if the inequality is true for one $C_k$ , it is true for any $C_k$ , by flipping the axes, and also for $C = \alpha C_k$ , for any $\alpha \geq 0$ , because \begin{align} \|(A + \alpha \, C_k)^{1/2} - (B + \alpha C_k)^{1/2}\|  &= \sqrt{\alpha} \|(A/\alpha +  C_k)^{1/2} - (B/\alpha + C_k)^{1/2}\|  \\ &\leq \sqrt{\alpha} \|(A/\alpha)^{1/2} - (B/\alpha)^{1/2}\| = \sqrt{\alpha} \|A^{1/2} - B^{1/2}\| \end{align} Now, a general diagonal $C$ can be decomposed as $C = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \alpha_k C_k$ . Applying the previous inequality (specialized for a matrix $C$ with only one nonzero diagonal element) repeatedly, we can remove the diagonal elements one by one \begin{align} &\|(A + \sum_{k=1}^{n}\alpha_k \, C_k)^{1/2} - (B + \sum_{k=1}^{n}\alpha_k \, C_k)^{1/2}\| \\ &\qquad = \|((A + \sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\alpha_k \, C_k) + \alpha_n C_n)^{1/2} - ((B + \sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\alpha_k \, C_k) + \alpha_n C_n)^{1/2}\| \\ &\qquad \leq \|(A + \sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\alpha_k \, C_k)^{1/2} - (B + \sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\alpha_k \, C_k)^{1/2}\| \\ &\qquad \leq \|(A + \sum_{k=1}^{n-2}\alpha_k \, C_k)^{1/2} - (B + \sum_{k=1}^{n-2}\alpha_k \, C_k)^{1/2}\| \\ &\qquad \leq \dots \leq \sqrt{\alpha} \|A^{1/2} - B^{1/2}\|. \end{align} Here are three ways of proving the inequality in 1 dimension, which I tried to generalize to the multidimensional case without success. Let us write $a$ , $b$ , $c$ instead of $A$ , $B$ , $C$ , to emphasize that we are working in one dimension, and let us assume without loss of generality that $a \leq b$ . Let us write: $$ f(c) = \sqrt{b + c} - \sqrt{a + c} $$ We calculate that the derivative of $f$ is given by $$ f'(c) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{b + c}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{a + c}} \right) \leq 0, $$ and so $f(c) = f(0) + \int_{0}^{c} f'(x) \, d x  \leq f(0)$ . We have, by the fundamental theorem of calculus and a change of variable \begin{align}     \sqrt{b + c} - \sqrt{a + c} &= \int_{a + c}^{b + c} \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{x}} \, d x = \int_{a}^{b} \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{x + c}} \, d x  \\     &\leq \int_{a}^{b} \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{x}} \, d x = \sqrt{b} - \sqrt{a}. \end{align} Squaring the two sides of the inequality, we obtain $$ a + c - 2 \sqrt{a+ c} \, \sqrt{b + c} + b + c \leq a + b - 2 \sqrt{a} \sqrt{b}. $$ Simplifying and rearranging, $$ c + \sqrt{a} \sqrt{b} \leq \sqrt{a+ c} \, \sqrt{b + c} . $$ Squaring again $$ \require{cancel} \cancel{c^2 + a b} + 2 c \sqrt{a b} \leq \cancel{c^2 + ab} + ac + bc, $$ leading to $$ a  + b - 2 \sqrt{ab} = (\sqrt{b} - \sqrt{a})^2 \geq 0$$ .

Applying the previous inequality (specialized for a matrix with only one nonzero diagonal element) repeatedly, we can remove the diagonal elements one by one Here are three ways of proving the inequality in 1 dimension, which I tried to generalize to the multidimensional case without success. Let us write , , instead of , , , to emphasize that we are working in one dimension, and let us assume without loss of generality that . Let us write: We calculate that the derivative of is given by and so . We have, by the fundamental theorem of calculus and a change of variable Squaring the two sides of the inequality, we obtain Simplifying and rearranging, Squaring again leading to .

Let $C$ be the matrix with blocks $\lmt -A&I&0&\cdots&0\\ I&-A&I&\ddots&\vdots\\ 0&I&-A&\ddots&0\\ \vdots&\ddots&\ddots&\ddots&I\\ 0&\cdots&0&I&-A \rmt$. Let $p_B$ be the characteristic polynomial of $B$. Then, the claim is that $$ \det C = \det p_B(A). $$ This was stated without proof, so I'm wondering if this follows from a well-known theorem, or if there's a slick proof of it. Also, I'm curious to what extent this claim generalizes. Thanks!",,"['matrices', 'determinant']"

Then (in analogy to the the case $f : \mathbb \to \mathbb R$ oder $f : \mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R^n$) we should have $d\operatorname{id}(A) = I$ for all matrices $A$, where $I$ is the identity matrix (and $d\operatorname{id}$ denotes the differential, i.e. the best linear approximation map). Now I read about matrix derivatives, for example on Wikipedia the derivate of a mapping $F : M(n,m) \to M(p,q)$ between matrix spaces is said to be: $$  \frac{\partial\mathbf{F}} {\partial\mathbf{X}}= \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial\mathbf{F}}{\partial X_{1,1}}  & \cdots & \frac{\partial \mathbf{F}}{\partial X_{n,1}}\\ \vdots  & \ddots  & \vdots\\ \frac{\partial\mathbf{F}}{\partial X_{1,m}} & \cdots & \frac{\partial \mathbf{F}}{\partial X_{n,m}}\\ \end{bmatrix}  $$ And also in the Matrix Cookbook the basic formula (on page 8) is written as $$  \frac{\partial X_{kl}}{\partial X_{ij}} = \delta_{ik}\delta_{lj} $$ (where $\delta_{ij}$ denotes the Kronecker delta) and this I guess is essentially the derivation formula for the identity map. So If I apply this on the above map $\operatorname{id} : \mathbb R^{n\times n} \to \mathbb R^{n\times n}$ I get an $4\times 4$ matrix $$  \begin{pmatrix}    \frac{\partial X}{\partial x_{11}} & \frac{\partial X}{\partial x_{21}} \\   \frac{\partial X}{\partial x_{12}} & \frac{\partial X}{\partial x_{22}}  \end{pmatrix}  =   \begin{pmatrix}   \frac{\partial \begin{pmatrix} x_{11} & x_{12} \\ x_{21} & x_{22} \end{pmatrix}}{\partial x_{11}} &  \frac{\partial \begin{pmatrix} x_{11} & x_{12} \\ x_{21} & x_{22} \end{pmatrix}}{\partial x_{21}} \\  \frac{\partial \begin{pmatrix} x_{11} & x_{12} \\ x_{21} & x_{22} \end{pmatrix}}{\partial x_{12}} &  \frac{\partial \begin{pmatrix} x_{11} & x_{12} \\ x_{21} & x_{22} \end{pmatrix}}{\partial x_{22}}  \end{pmatrix}   = \begin{pmatrix}       1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\      0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\      0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\      0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}           $$ (where I on the last line had not written out the blockmatrices). But this result is quite different from what I would intuitively expect, so what did I wrong? Maybe I am interpreting all these matrix derivatives wrong, could someone please explain?","Consider a map $f : \mathbb R^{n\times m} \to \mathbb R^{p \times l}$ between matrix spaces, what is the differential of such a mapping?

I have a low rank matrix given as $AB^T$ where $A,B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$ and $p \ll n$. (I know $A$ and $B$ separately) One efficient way to get the Singular Value Decomposition is to do a reduced QR on $A$ and $B$ i.e. $A = Q_A R_A$ and $B = Q_B R_B$. The above can be done in $\mathcal{O}(p^2n)$ cost. I could then compute the svd of $R_A R_B^T = U_1 \Sigma V_1^T$ which is $\mathcal{O}(p^3)$. Hence this will give me $$AB^T = (Q_A U_1) \Sigma (Q_B V_1)^T$$ The total cost is $\mathcal{O}(np^2)$. However, I am wondering if there are other efficient ways to go about doing this to reduce the coefficient infront of $p^2n$. If I am right, the coefficient infront of $np^2$ is $3$ if we go about doing QR. The reason why I am interested in minimizing the coefficient is that my $n$ is really ginormous. So if I were to implement it, a cost cutting on the coefficient of the $\mathcal{O}(n)$ could be significant.
