3,Strategies for proving that a critical point is neither maximum nor minimum,Strategies for proving that a critical point is neither maximum nor minimum,,"Let $f(x,y) = x^3 + y^3 -3x$ .

However, $\det Hf|_{(\pm1,0)} = 0$ , so we can't apply the Second partial derivative test. Since $f$ is odd, we might suspect these are saddle points. One way to proceed is to find curves: $$f \circ \alpha (t) = f\circ (t^2+1, (3^{\frac{1}{3}}t^{\frac{2}{3}})) = (t^2+1)^3 -3$$ $$f \circ \beta (t) = f\circ (-t^2+1, (-3^{\frac{1}{3}}t^{\frac{2}{3}})) = (-t^2+1)^3 -3$$ And it's clear that $f \circ \alpha (t)$ has a minimum at $t=0$ and that $f \circ \beta (t)$ has a maximum at $t=0$ , which implies $(1,0)$ is a saddle point of $f$ .

15,"Understanding Duhamel's principle, PDE","Understanding Duhamel's principle, PDE",,"so i'm really having a problem with Duhamel's principle, i'll explain what i know and if possible could someone help me fix my lack of understanding. Thanks! so from my understanding of Duhamel's principle, if we have an inhomgenous PDE (for example the heat equation) such as (Current case is finite domain $(0,a)$ ) $$u_t = Du_{xx}+f(x,t),~~~ u(x,0)=\phi(x) \\ u(0,t)=h(t), ~~~~~~ u(a,t)=g(t)$$ my first issue, in the above we have inhomogenous boundry conditions, if we had homogenous boundry conditions can i still use Duhamel's principle?  (Despite the fact that i could solve it using Seperation of variables) or is the inhomogenous BC's the ""signal"" to use Duhamels principle? First we find $v(x,t)$ which satisfies an auxiliary question $$v_t=Dv_{xx},\\~~v(x,0) = 0 \\ v(0,t)= g(t), ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ v(a,t) = h(t)$$ which basically comes down to finding an interpolation of h and g. (so long as its matchs the boundary conditions its all good). Second: we solve the problem $$w_t = Dw_{xx}+f(x,t), \\w(x,0)= \phi(x) \\ w(0,t)= w(a,t) = 0$$ with solution $$w(x,t) = \sum w_n(t) \sin{\frac{\pi n x}{a}}$$ $$\text{ where } w_n(t) = w_n(0)e^{\frac{-D \pi^2 n^2 t}{a^2}} + e^{\frac{-D \pi^2 n^2 t}{a^2}} \int_{0}^{t} e^{\frac{-D \pi^2 n^2 s}{a^2}} f_n(s)ds$$ $$w_n(0) = \frac{2}{a}\int_0^{a} \phi(x) \sin{\frac{\pi n x}{a}} dx$$ and $$f_n(x) = \frac{2}{a}\int_0^a f(x,t)\sin{\frac{\pi n x}{a}}$$ then the solution to our original problem is $$u(x,t) = v(x,t) + w(x,t)$$ step 1: Solve a shifted problem by finding $v(x,t)$ which satisfies the Boundary conditions from the general problem. step 2: solve the inhomogenous problem with homogeneous boundary conditions, whilst keeping the initial condition step 3: Sum the two. i believe this is the method to use the principle. In this instance (in terms of the heat equation) we have an external source which is adding values to the PDE. so the problem with solution v(x,t) is akin to shifting the initial amount of energy in the system by $\phi(x)$ and eliminating the external source. (this makes sense because if we dont have the external source then we should have zero initial energy also extending the principle to neumann conditions. are all we doing again defining v to solve the boundary conditions in terms of $v$ and $v_t$ ? in the next scenario we have 1 dimensional infinite domains so our problem is $$u_t = Du_{xx}+f(x,t) \\ u(x,0) = \phi(x)$$ in this instance we dont have boundary conditions so we solve the following $$v_t=Dv_{xx}, \\v(x,0) = \phi(x)$$ ie we eliminate the source again and have a solution of $$v(x,t) = \int_{\mathbb{R}}\Phi(x-y)\phi(y)~dy$$ next we solve $$w_t = Dw_{xx}+f(x,t) \\ w(x,0) = 0$$ which again gives $$w(x,t) = \int_0^t \int_{\mathbb{R}}\Phi(x-y,t-s)f(y,s)~dyds$$ which are true due to the translational and diliational invariance of the heat equation. finally $u = v +w$ so to me it seems that practically we eliminate our initial condition and source term from our problem. solve the equation, then solve a new equation with the source term but no initial condition, and sum the two. intuitively i have no idea why. or whether my understanding of the procedure is correct (in fairness ive been going over this for the last few days, tried researching it and at this point just frazzled) any help guys and girls? thanks for the help. Update: after having let my brain deglaze a bit and then redoing some research on the subject i've built up a little bit more of an intuitive rationale why, again i would need people to help confirm. from my current understanding the arguement is that a non-homogenous system is akin to a homogenous one where at some time period s < t a source term starts adding in energy to the system, in that case what we're really doing is just kind of ""Psuedo"" scaling back time and since v and w both solve our ""basic"" version of the heat equation they can be considered particular solutions that correspond to the different set ups of the system, Ie one solves for the Boundary conditions and one solves for the source itself. am i on the right lines? update 2: ive found a pdf on the physics exchange which explains the procedure more accurately.

19,"Is there a generalization of Stokes theorem for forms with poles and distributions, as seen in physics?","Is there a generalization of Stokes theorem for forms with poles and distributions, as seen in physics?",,"Stokes theorem for smooth differential forms is well-known. If $\alpha$ is a smooth differential $n$-form defined on an $(n+1)$-dimensional compact oriented manifold with boundary, then we have $$\int_Md\alpha=\int_{\partial M}\alpha.$$ In physics, one considers a generalized form of this equation, where the manifold need not be compact, and the differential form need not be smooth everywhere; it may have poles. For example, in electrostatics one sees a 2-form field generated by a point charge $Q$ $$E=\dfrac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0r^3}\left(x\,dy\wedge dz+y\,dz\wedge dx+z\,dx\wedge dy\right)=\dfrac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0r^2}d\Omega_{S^2},$$ where $d\Omega_{S^2}$ is the volume form of the sphere.

If $\alpha$ is a smooth differential $n$-form defined on an $(n+1)$-dimensional compact oriented manifold with boundary, then we have $$\int_Md\alpha=\int_{\partial M}\alpha.$$ In physics, one considers a generalized form of this equation, where the manifold need not be compact, and the differential form need not be smooth everywhere; it may have poles. For example, in electrostatics one sees a 2-form field generated by a point charge $Q$ $$E=\dfrac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0r^3}\left(x\,dy\wedge dz+y\,dz\wedge dx+z\,dx\wedge dy\right)=\dfrac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0r^2}d\Omega_{S^2},$$ where $d\Omega_{S^2}$ is the volume form of the sphere.

In particular, if $h_{ij}$ is the Hessian of a scalar function $f$, $$ h_{ij} = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} \equiv f_{,ij}, $$ then half the product is $$ \tfrac{1}{2}(h\wedge \!\!\!\!\!\!\bigcirc h)_{ijkl} = f_{,ik}f_{,jl} - f_{,il}f_{,jk}. $$ Again, in 2D, this is the determinant of the Hessian, which I understand to be the discriminant at a critical point (only in 2D).

64,The missing vector derivative operation,The missing vector derivative operation,,"Generally, the differential operator $d$ takes differential $k$-forms to $(k+1)$-forms.  In $\mathbb{R}^n$ (or more generally on an oriented Riemannian manifold), we can identify vector fields with $1$-forms and $(n-1)$-forms, and functions with $0$-forms and $n$-forms.  If we write $\phi$ for the map between vector fields and 1-forms, and $\psi$ for the map between vector fields and $(n-1)$-forms, then the composite function $=$ 0-form $\xrightarrow{d}$ 1-form $\xrightarrow{\phi}$ vector field is the gradient, and the composite vector field $\xrightarrow{\psi}$ $(n-1)$-form $\xrightarrow{d}$ $n$-form $=$ function is the divergence.  When $n=3$, we also have the composite vector field $\xrightarrow{\phi}$ 1-form $\xrightarrow{d}$ 2-form $\xrightarrow{\psi}$ vector field which is the curl.  And when $n=2$, we have the composite vector field $\xrightarrow{\phi}$ 1-form $\xrightarrow{d}$ 2-form $=$ function which is the ""scalar curl"" that appears in Green's theorem.  Note that it differs from the $n=2$ case of the divergence only in that it involves $\phi$ rather than $\psi$.  When $n=2$ both $\phi$ and $\psi$ relate vector fields to 1-forms, but they do it differently; we have $\phi(\langle F,G\rangle) = F\,dx + G\,dy$, while $\psi(\langle F,G\rangle) = -G\,dx + F\,dy$. This suggests that there is another way to put these together when $n=2$: function $=$ 0-form $\xrightarrow{d}$ 1-form $\xrightarrow{\psi}$ vector field This looks like the $n=2$ case of the gradient, but involves $\psi$ rather than $\phi$.  In coordinates, it takes a function $f$ to the vector field $\langle \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} , -\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\rangle$. I've never seen this operation before; does it have a name?  It seems potentially interesting, e.g. when we specialize the generalized Stokes' theorem to it we get an FTC for its flux line integrals along curves, analogous to the usual FTC for the flow line integral of a gradient field.","Generally, the differential operator $d$ takes differential $k$-forms to $(k+1)$-forms.

Easy question: Let $f(x,y)$ be a ""generic"" polynomial in two variables, of total degree $\le D$. What's a good upper bound for how many critical points (minimum/maximum) it has in $\mathbb R^2$? Solution: The critical points satisfy $\nabla f = 0$, so we can try to count the combined zeroes of the two polynomials $\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}$ and $\frac {\partial f}{\partial y}$, both of degree $\le D$. We assume they're both irreducible ($f$ is ""generic""), and Bezout's theorem says there are at most $D^2$ solutions.

Approach #1: Lagrange multipliers. Each critical point satisfies $\nabla f = (\lambda A, \lambda B)$ for some $\lambda \in \mathbb R$.

By ""Bezout"" (or just elementary algebra) there are at most $D$ solutions to $g'(t)=0$. My question: Clearly Approach #2 gave a better result. However, I want to apply this in a harder scenario where there are more variables, more constraints, and some of the constraints are non-linear. In this scenario it seems ""ugly"" to parameterize the constraints like I did in approach #2, and very nice and clean to use Lagrange multipliers. But I want a better result. How do I modify the Lagrange multiplier approach to get the better bound, while avoiding parameterizing the curve (line)?",,"['calculus', 'multivariable-calculus', 'algebraic-geometry', 'lagrange-multiplier']"

81,Far-field Poynting vector for time varying source [check my math please],Far-field Poynting vector for time varying source [check my math please],,"This is a question from classical electrodynamics, but it's the maths of it I need some help in. I have fields $\rho\left(\vec{r},t\right)$, $\vec{J}\left(\vec{r},t\right)$, $\vec{E}\left(\vec{r},t\right)$ and $\vec{B}\left(\vec{r},t\right)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The fields $\rho$ and $\vec{J}$ are related by the Continuity Equation : $$ -\dfrac {\partial \rho (\vec{r}, t)} {\partial t} = \nabla \cdot \vec{J} (\vec{r}, t) $$ Let us say $\mathbb{V}_s \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ is the smallest spherical volume such that: $$ \forall t, \qquad \forall \vec{r}\notin \mathbb{V}_s: \qquad\qquad \rho\left(\vec{r},t\right) = \vec{J}\left(\vec{r},t\right) = 0 $$ $$ \forall t, \qquad \forall \vec{r}\in \partial\mathbb{V}_s: \qquad\qquad \rho\left(\vec{r},t\right) = \vec{J}\left(\vec{r},t\right) = 0  $$ Since $\mathbb{V}_s$ is a sphere, I say that its center is at $\vec{r}_0$, and its diameter id $\mathcal{D}$. Now given the definitions: $$ \vec{r}_s \in \mathbb{V}_s,\qquad \vec{R} = \vec{r} - \vec{r}_s,\qquad R=\left|\vec{R}\right|, \qquad \hat{R}=\frac {\vec{R}} {R}, \qquad t_r = t - \frac {R} {c} $$ The fields $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$ are as follows: $$ \vec{E}\left(\vec{r},t\right) = \frac {1} {4 \pi \epsilon_0} \iiint_{\mathbb{V}_s} {\left[ \frac {\rho (\vec{r}_s, t_r)} {R^2} \hat{R} + \frac {1} {R c} \frac {\partial \rho (\vec{r}_s, t_r) } {\partial t} \hat{R} - \frac {1} {R c^2} \frac {\partial \vec{J} (\vec{r}_s, t_r) } {\partial t} \right]} \space dV\left(\vec{r}_s\right) $$ $$ \vec{B}\left(\vec{r},t\right) = \frac {\mu_0} {4 \pi} \iiint_{\mathbb{V}_s} {\left[ \frac {\vec{J}  (\vec{r}_s, t_r)} {R^2} \times \hat{R} + \frac {1} {R c} \frac {\partial \vec{J}  (\vec{r}_s, t_r) } {\partial t} \times \hat{R} \right]} \space dV\left(\vec{r}_s\right) $$ (Physically, $\vec{E}$, $\vec{B}$. $\vec{J}$ & $\rho$ have the standard meanings from Electrodynamics. The equations above are the Jefimenko's equations ) Now the paper ""The Relation Between Expressions for Time-Dependent Electromagnetic Fields Given by Jefimenko and by Panofsky and Phillips"" by Kirk T. McDonald shows that the expression for $\vec{E}$ can be transformed into: $$ \scriptsize{ \vec{E}\left(\vec{r},t\right) = \frac {1} {4 \pi \epsilon_0} \iiint_{\mathbb{V}_s} {\left[ \frac {\rho (\vec{r}_s, t_r)} {R^2} \hat{R}  + \frac        { \left(\vec{J} (\vec{r}_s, t_r) \cdot \hat{R}\right)\hat{R} + \left(\vec{J} (\vec{r}_s, t_r) \times\hat{R}\right) \times \hat{R} }        {R^2 c}  + \frac {1} {R c^2} \left( \frac {\partial \vec{J} (\vec{r}_s, t_r) } {\partial t} \times \hat{R} \right) \times \hat{R} \right]} \space dV\left(\vec{r}_s\right) } $$ Now I want to compute the quantity $\vec{S}\left(\vec{r},t\right) =  \dfrac {\vec{E}\left(\vec{r},t\right) \times \vec{B}\left(\vec{r},t\right)} {\mu_0}$ for $\vec{r}$ for which $R \gg \mathcal{D}$. I figured that for such values of $\vec{r}$, the maximum possible difference between the values of $\dfrac 1 R$ for any two points $\vec{r}_s \in \mathbb{V}_s$ is: $$\frac{1}{R} - \frac{1}{R+\mathcal{D}} = \frac{\mathcal{D}}{R\left(R+\mathcal{D}\right)} = \frac{1}{R}\cfrac{ \color{red}{\frac{\mathcal{D}}{R}}}{1+\color{red}{\frac{\mathcal{D}}{R}}}$$ Similarly, the maximum possible angle between the values of $\hat{R}$ for any two points $\vec{r}_s \in \mathbb{V}_s$  is: $$ 2\;{\tan}^{-1}\left(\frac12 \color{red} {\frac{\mathcal{D}}{R}}\right) $$ When $R \gg \mathcal{D}$, $\dfrac {\mathcal{D}} R \approx 0$, and each of the two expressions above are $\approx 0$ as well. So $\dfrac 1 R$ and $\hat{R}$ are essentially independent of $\vec{r}_s$. We can, therefore, bring out all $\dfrac 1 R$ and $\hat{R}$ factors outside the integral sign. So if I define the following: $$ W\left(\vec{r},t\right) =  \iiint_{\mathbb{V}_s}  \rho \left( \vec{r}_s, t_r \right) \space dV\left(\vec{r}_s\right) $$ $$ \vec{Y}\left(\vec{r},t\right) =  \iiint_{\mathbb{V}_s}  \vec{J} \left( \vec{r}_s, t_r \right) \space dV\left(\vec{r}_s\right) $$ $$ \vec{Z}\left(\vec{r},t\right) =  \iiint_{\mathbb{V}_s}   \frac {\partial \vec{J} \left( \vec{r}_s, t_r \right) } {\partial t} \space dV\left(\vec{r}_s\right)  = \frac {\partial \vec{Y}\left(\vec{r},t\right)} {\partial t} $$ I can then say: $$ \vec{E}\left(\vec{r},t\right) = \frac {1} {4 \pi \epsilon_0} \left[    \frac {W (\vec{r}, t)} {R^2} \hat{R}     + \frac {\vec{Y} (\vec{r}, t) \cdot \hat{R}} {R^2 c} \hat{R}     + \frac {\left(\vec{Y}(\vec{r}, t) \times \hat{R}\right) \times \hat{R}} {R^2 c}     + \frac {\left(\vec{Z}(\vec{r}, t) \times \hat{R}\right) \times \hat{R}} {R c^2}   \right] $$ $$ \vec{B}\left(\vec{r},t\right) = \frac {\mu_0} {4 \pi} \left[     \frac {\vec{Y}  (\vec{r}, t) \times \hat{R}} {R^2}     + \frac {\vec{Z}(\vec{r}, t) \times \hat{R}} {R c}  \right] $$ Applying $\color{blue}{\left(\vec{a} \times \hat{u}\right) \times \hat{u} \equiv \left(\vec{a}\cdot\hat{u}\right)\hat{u} - \vec{a}}$, we can then say: $$ \vec{E}\left(\vec{r},t\right) = \frac {1} {4 \pi \epsilon_0} \left[  \left(     \frac {W (\vec{r}, t)} {R^2}     + 2\frac        {\vec{Y} (\vec{r}, t) \cdot \hat{R}}        {R^2 c}     + \frac       {\vec{Z}\left( \vec{r}, t \right)\cdot\hat{R}}       {R c^2}    \right) \hat{R}  - \frac 1 {Rc} \left(      \frac {\vec{Y} (\vec{r}, t) } {R}    + \frac {\vec{Z}(\vec{r}, t)} {c}    \right) \right] $$ $$ \vec{B}\left(\vec{r},t\right) = \frac {\mu_0} {4 \pi} \left[ \frac 1 R {\left( \frac {\vec{Y}  (\vec{r}, t)} {R} + \frac {\vec{Z}(\vec{r}, t)} {c} \right)} \times \hat{R} \right] $$ Thus, if I define: $$ \mathcal{U}\left(\vec{r},t\right) =   \color{blue}{   \vec{W} \left(\vec{r},t\right)    + \frac {\vec{Y} \left(\vec{r},t\right) \cdot \hat{R}} {c}  }  = \iiint_{\mathbb{V}_s} \left[    \rho \left( \vec{r}_s, t_r \right)    + \frac { \vec{J} \left( \vec{r}_s, t_r \right) \cdot \hat{R} } {c} \right] \space dV\left(\vec{r}_s\right) $$ $$ \vec{\mathcal{X}} \left(\vec{r},t\right) =   \color{blue}{     \frac {\vec{Y} \left(\vec{r},t\right)} {R}     + \frac {\vec{Z} \left(\vec{r},t\right)}  {c}   } = \iiint_{\mathbb{V}_s} \left[    \frac { \vec{J} \left( \vec{r}_s, t_r \right) } {R}    + \frac 1 c \frac {\partial \vec{J} \left( \vec{r}_s, t_r \right) } {\partial t} \right] \space dV\left(\vec{r}_s\right) $$ I get: $$ \vec{E}\left(\vec{r},t\right) = \frac {1} {4 \pi \epsilon_0}  \left[   \frac {\mathcal{U}\left(\vec{r},t\right)} {R^2} \hat{R}   + \frac {\left( \vec{\mathcal{X}}\left(\vec{r},t\right) \times \hat{R}\right) \times \hat{R}} {Rc}  \right] $$ $$ \vec{B}\left(\vec{r},t\right) = \frac {\mu_0} {4 \pi}  \left[   \frac {\vec{\mathcal{X}} \left(\vec{r},t\right) \times \hat{R}} {R}  \right] $$ Finally giving me: $$ \vec{S}\left(\vec{r},t\right) =   \mathcal{U} \left(\vec{r},t\right) \frac {\hat{R} \times \left( \vec{\mathcal{X}} \left(\vec{r},t\right) \times \hat{R} \right) } {16 \pi^2 \epsilon_0 R^3}   + \frac {\left| \vec{\mathcal{X}} \left(\vec{r},t\right) \times \hat{R} \right|^2}  {16 \pi^2 \epsilon_0 R^2 c} \hat{R} $$ Now my first question is: Is my math correct so far? Now, I define a sphere $\mathbb{V}$ with its center at $\vec{r}_0$ (the center of the source volume $\mathbb{V}_s$.) such that point $\vec{r}$ is on its surface. Then the unit vector $\hat{R}$ will actually be the unit normal $\hat{n}\left(\vec{r}\right)$ at $\vec{r}$. I want to compute the power passing the surface of $\mathbb{V}$, which should be: $$ \oint_{\partial\mathbb{V}}   \vec{S}\left(\vec{r},t\right) \cdot \hat{R} \;ds\left(\vec{r}\right) = \frac 1 {16 \pi^2 \epsilon_0 R^2 c} \oint_{\partial\mathbb{V}} \left| \frac {\vec{Y}\left(\vec{r},t\right) \times \hat{R}} {R} + \frac {\vec{Z}\left(\vec{r},t\right) \times \hat{R}} {c} \right|^2 \;ds\left(\vec{r}\right)  $$ My second question is: How do I parameterize and compute this surface integral?

Would appreciate any help...","This is a question from classical electrodynamics, but it's the maths of it I need some help in. I have fields $\rho\left(\vec{r},t\right)$, $\vec{J}\left(\vec{r},t\right)$, $\vec{E}\left(\vec{r},t\right)$ and $\vec{B}\left(\vec{r},t\right)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The fields $\rho$ and $\vec{J}$ are related by the Continuity Equation : $$ -\dfrac {\partial \rho (\vec{r}, t)} {\partial t} = \nabla \cdot \vec{J} (\vec{r}, t) $$ Let us say $\mathbb{V}_s \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ is the smallest spherical volume such that: $$ \forall t, \qquad \forall \vec{r}\notin \mathbb{V}_s: \qquad\qquad \rho\left(\vec{r},t\right) = \vec{J}\left(\vec{r},t\right) = 0 $$ $$ \forall t, \qquad \forall \vec{r}\in \partial\mathbb{V}_s: \qquad\qquad \rho\left(\vec{r},t\right) = \vec{J}\left(\vec{r},t\right) = 0  $$ Since $\mathbb{V}_s$ is a sphere, I say that its center is at $\vec{r}_0$, and its diameter id $\mathcal{D}$. Now given the definitions: $$ \vec{r}_s \in \mathbb{V}_s,\qquad \vec{R} = \vec{r} - \vec{r}_s,\qquad R=\left|\vec{R}\right|, \qquad \hat{R}=\frac {\vec{R}} {R}, \qquad t_r = t - \frac {R} {c} $$ The fields $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$ are as follows: $$ \vec{E}\left(\vec{r},t\right) = \frac {1} {4 \pi \epsilon_0} \iiint_{\mathbb{V}_s} {\left[ \frac {\rho (\vec{r}_s, t_r)} {R^2} \hat{R} + \frac {1} {R c} \frac {\partial \rho (\vec{r}_s, t_r) } {\partial t} \hat{R} - \frac {1} {R c^2} \frac {\partial \vec{J} (\vec{r}_s, t_r) } {\partial t} \right]} \space dV\left(\vec{r}_s\right) $$ $$ \vec{B}\left(\vec{r},t\right) = \frac {\mu_0} {4 \pi} \iiint_{\mathbb{V}_s} {\left[ \frac {\vec{J}  (\vec{r}_s, t_r)} {R^2} \times \hat{R} + \frac {1} {R c} \frac {\partial \vec{J}  (\vec{r}_s, t_r) } {\partial t} \times \hat{R} \right]} \space dV\left(\vec{r}_s\right) $$ (Physically, $\vec{E}$, $\vec{B}$. $\vec{J}$ & $\rho$ have the standard meanings from Electrodynamics. The equations above are the Jefimenko's equations ) Now the paper ""The Relation Between Expressions for Time-Dependent Electromagnetic Fields Given by Jefimenko and by Panofsky and Phillips"" by Kirk T. McDonald shows that the expression for $\vec{E}$ can be transformed into: $$ \scriptsize{ \vec{E}\left(\vec{r},t\right) = \frac {1} {4 \pi \epsilon_0} \iiint_{\mathbb{V}_s} {\left[ \frac {\rho (\vec{r}_s, t_r)} {R^2} \hat{R}  + \frac        { \left(\vec{J} (\vec{r}_s, t_r) \cdot \hat{R}\right)\hat{R} + \left(\vec{J} (\vec{r}_s, t_r) \times\hat{R}\right) \times \hat{R} }        {R^2 c}  + \frac {1} {R c^2} \left( \frac {\partial \vec{J} (\vec{r}_s, t_r) } {\partial t} \times \hat{R} \right) \times \hat{R} \right]} \space dV\left(\vec{r}_s\right) } $$ Now I want to compute the quantity $\vec{S}\left(\vec{r},t\right) =  \dfrac {\vec{E}\left(\vec{r},t\right) \times \vec{B}\left(\vec{r},t\right)} {\mu_0}$ for $\vec{r}$ for which $R \gg \mathcal{D}$. I figured that for such values of $\vec{r}$, the maximum possible difference between the values of $\dfrac 1 R$ for any two points $\vec{r}_s \in \mathbb{V}_s$ is: $$\frac{1}{R} - \frac{1}{R+\mathcal{D}} = \frac{\mathcal{D}}{R\left(R+\mathcal{D}\right)} = \frac{1}{R}\cfrac{ \color{red}{\frac{\mathcal{D}}{R}}}{1+\color{red}{\frac{\mathcal{D}}{R}}}$$ Similarly, the maximum possible angle between the values of $\hat{R}$ for any two points $\vec{r}_s \in \mathbb{V}_s$  is: $$ 2\;{\tan}^{-1}\left(\frac12 \color{red} {\frac{\mathcal{D}}{R}}\right) $$ When $R \gg \mathcal{D}$, $\dfrac {\mathcal{D}} R \approx 0$, and each of the two expressions above are $\approx 0$ as well. So $\dfrac 1 R$ and $\hat{R}$ are essentially independent of $\vec{r}_s$. We can, therefore, bring out all $\dfrac 1 R$ and $\hat{R}$ factors outside the integral sign. So if I define the following: $$ W\left(\vec{r},t\right) =  \iiint_{\mathbb{V}_s}  \rho \left( \vec{r}_s, t_r \right) \space dV\left(\vec{r}_s\right) $$ $$ \vec{Y}\left(\vec{r},t\right) =  \iiint_{\mathbb{V}_s}  \vec{J} \left( \vec{r}_s, t_r \right) \space dV\left(\vec{r}_s\right) $$ $$ \vec{Z}\left(\vec{r},t\right) =  \iiint_{\mathbb{V}_s}   \frac {\partial \vec{J} \left( \vec{r}_s, t_r \right) } {\partial t} \space dV\left(\vec{r}_s\right)  = \frac {\partial \vec{Y}\left(\vec{r},t\right)} {\partial t} $$ I can then say: $$ \vec{E}\left(\vec{r},t\right) = \frac {1} {4 \pi \epsilon_0} \left[    \frac {W (\vec{r}, t)} {R^2} \hat{R}     + \frac {\vec{Y} (\vec{r}, t) \cdot \hat{R}} {R^2 c} \hat{R}     + \frac {\left(\vec{Y}(\vec{r}, t) \times \hat{R}\right) \times \hat{R}} {R^2 c}     + \frac {\left(\vec{Z}(\vec{r}, t) \times \hat{R}\right) \times \hat{R}} {R c^2}   \right] $$ $$ \vec{B}\left(\vec{r},t\right) = \frac {\mu_0} {4 \pi} \left[     \frac {\vec{Y}  (\vec{r}, t) \times \hat{R}} {R^2}     + \frac {\vec{Z}(\vec{r}, t) \times \hat{R}} {R c}  \right] $$ Applying $\color{blue}{\left(\vec{a} \times \hat{u}\right) \times \hat{u} \equiv \left(\vec{a}\cdot\hat{u}\right)\hat{u} - \vec{a}}$, we can then say: $$ \vec{E}\left(\vec{r},t\right) = \frac {1} {4 \pi \epsilon_0} \left[  \left(     \frac {W (\vec{r}, t)} {R^2}     + 2\frac        {\vec{Y} (\vec{r}, t) \cdot \hat{R}}        {R^2 c}     + \frac       {\vec{Z}\left( \vec{r}, t \right)\cdot\hat{R}}       {R c^2}    \right) \hat{R}  - \frac 1 {Rc} \left(      \frac {\vec{Y} (\vec{r}, t) } {R}    + \frac {\vec{Z}(\vec{r}, t)} {c}    \right) \right] $$ $$ \vec{B}\left(\vec{r},t\right) = \frac {\mu_0} {4 \pi} \left[ \frac 1 R {\left( \frac {\vec{Y}  (\vec{r}, t)} {R} + \frac {\vec{Z}(\vec{r}, t)} {c} \right)} \times \hat{R} \right] $$ Thus, if I define: $$ \mathcal{U}\left(\vec{r},t\right) =   \color{blue}{   \vec{W} \left(\vec{r},t\right)    + \frac {\vec{Y} \left(\vec{r},t\right) \cdot \hat{R}} {c}  }  = \iiint_{\mathbb{V}_s} \left[    \rho \left( \vec{r}_s, t_r \right)    + \frac { \vec{J} \left( \vec{r}_s, t_r \right) \cdot \hat{R} } {c} \right] \space dV\left(\vec{r}_s\right) $$ $$ \vec{\mathcal{X}} \left(\vec{r},t\right) =   \color{blue}{     \frac {\vec{Y} \left(\vec{r},t\right)} {R}     + \frac {\vec{Z} \left(\vec{r},t\right)}  {c}   } = \iiint_{\mathbb{V}_s} \left[    \frac { \vec{J} \left( \vec{r}_s, t_r \right) } {R}    + \frac 1 c \frac {\partial \vec{J} \left( \vec{r}_s, t_r \right) } {\partial t} \right] \space dV\left(\vec{r}_s\right) $$ I get: $$ \vec{E}\left(\vec{r},t\right) = \frac {1} {4 \pi \epsilon_0}  \left[   \frac {\mathcal{U}\left(\vec{r},t\right)} {R^2} \hat{R}   + \frac {\left( \vec{\mathcal{X}}\left(\vec{r},t\right) \times \hat{R}\right) \times \hat{R}} {Rc}  \right] $$ $$ \vec{B}\left(\vec{r},t\right) = \frac {\mu_0} {4 \pi}  \left[   \frac {\vec{\mathcal{X}} \left(\vec{r},t\right) \times \hat{R}} {R}  \right] $$ Finally giving me: $$ \vec{S}\left(\vec{r},t\right) =   \mathcal{U} \left(\vec{r},t\right) \frac {\hat{R} \times \left( \vec{\mathcal{X}} \left(\vec{r},t\right) \times \hat{R} \right) } {16 \pi^2 \epsilon_0 R^3}   + \frac {\left| \vec{\mathcal{X}} \left(\vec{r},t\right) \times \hat{R} \right|^2}  {16 \pi^2 \epsilon_0 R^2 c} \hat{R} $$ Now my first question is: Is my math correct so far? Now, I define a sphere $\mathbb{V}$ with its center at $\vec{r}_0$ (the center of the source volume $\mathbb{V}_s$.) such that point $\vec{r}$ is on its surface. Then the unit vector $\hat{R}$ will actually be the unit normal $\hat{n}\left(\vec{r}\right)$ at $\vec{r}$. I want to compute the power passing the surface of $\mathbb{V}$, which should be: $$ \oint_{\partial\mathbb{V}}   \vec{S}\left(\vec{r},t\right) \cdot \hat{R} \;ds\left(\vec{r}\right) = \frac 1 {16 \pi^2 \epsilon_0 R^2 c} \oint_{\partial\mathbb{V}} \left| \frac {\vec{Y}\left(\vec{r},t\right) \times \hat{R}} {R} + \frac {\vec{Z}\left(\vec{r},t\right) \times \hat{R}} {c} \right|^2 \;ds\left(\vec{r}\right)  $$ My second question is: How do I parameterize and compute this surface integral?

92,Making the rigorous link between the conceptual interpretation of curl and the formula,Making the rigorous link between the conceptual interpretation of curl and the formula,,"EDIT: I would like to clarify for potential new readers what the gist of this question is, and how it differs from other questions about curl on this site. Namely, I'm confused about: The specifics of the physical interpretation of curl (is it infinitesimal torque, average infinitesimal torque, average infinitesimal angular acceleration , etc.) How this specific physical interpretation translates into a formula (ideally, the integral below as seen on Wikipedia) How this formula becomes the usual definition of curl. I'm not confused about what curl is on a general level, I'm confused about why the formula for curl coincides with the physical interpretation , on an intuitive and rigorous basis. I'm having a bit of difficulty making the connection between the intuitive idea of the curl of a vector field (as the torque experienced on an infinitesimally small paddle wheel placed at a point in the vector field), and the formula for it (I'll stick to 2-D first off, which is how the MIT OpenCourseware lectures define it at first): $$ \nabla\times F = N_x-M_y $$ where $F(x,y)=(M(x,y),N(x,y))$. (Yes this is a scalar whereas curl is normally a vector, but I interpret this definition of curl to be the signed magnitude of the torque, since the direction is perpendicular to the $xy$ plane for all 2-D fields). I can accept that this formula aligns with the idea of ""infinitesimal torque"", but I'd like to see it in action in a rigorous setting. So, I asked myself, what would the torque be at a point in a vector field? If we were to place a non-infinitesimal paddle wheel (a circle of radius $r$) centered at $(x_1, y_1)$, it would be experiencing forces at each point in its area. If $\vec{r}$ is the position vector from the center of the wheel to where the force is exerted, then the torque is $\vec{r}\cdot\vec{F}$. The net torque is just the sum of all the torques, so the net torque experienced by the paddle wheel should be: $$ \tau=\mathop{\iint}_{(x-x_1)^2+(y-y_1)^2\le r^2}(x-x_1,y-y_1)\cdot F(x,y)\ \text{d}A $$ If we want to find the infinitesimal torque, we would supposedly take the limit as $r\to 0$. However, this doesn't make sense, as this would imply that the infinitesimal torque is zero (since the integral goes to zero). What's missing? I assume we needed some sort of limiting factor to divide by in the limit. I know from physics that $\tau = \alpha I$ where $I$ is the moment of inertia (for our 2-D paddle wheel with unit density, $I=\frac\pi2r^4$). So maybe curl is actually the infinitesimal angular acceleration? If so, then we have $$ \nabla\times F = \lim_{r\to0}\frac{2}{\pi r^4}\mathop{\iint}_{(x-x_1)^2+(y-y_1)^2\le r^2}(x-x_1,y-y_1)\cdot F(x,y)\ \text{d}A $$ This looks similar but not quite what the formula on Wikipedia is: $$ (\nabla\times F)\cdot\mathbf{\vec{n}} = \|\nabla\times F\| = \lim{A\to 0}\frac1{|A|}\oint_C\mathbf{F}\cdot d\mathbf{r} $$ Why, here, is the area $|A|$ the limiting factor? That doesn't make much sense to me. Is curl then the average infinitesimal torque, averaged over an infinitesimal area (since $|A|\to 0$)? Wikipedia also says that the curl is the ""circulation density "", rather than simply the torque. So is my initial interpretation of the curl wrong? Furthermore, what change would I have to make to my interpretation to go from my integral to the integral on wikipedia (since the integrands are different and I'm not sure what to do about that), and then how do you go from the integral to the initial formula for curl?
