0,Approximate $|x|$ with a smooth function,Approximate  with a smooth function,|x|,"I am trying to get the derivative of $|x|$, and I want that derivative function, say $g(x)$, to be a function of x. So it really needs the |x| to be smooth (ex. $x^2$); I am wondering what is the best way to approximate |x| with something smooth? I propose $\sqrt{x^2 + \epsilon}$, where $\epsilon = 10^{-10}$, but there should be something better? Perhaps Taylor expansion? Sorry for any confusion. I should add some additional information here: I want to use $|x|$ as part of an object function $J(x)$ which I want to minimize.

As the title, calculate the limit $$\lim_{s\to0^+}\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{\sin n}{n^s}.$$ It is clear that the Dirichlet series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{\sin n}{n^s}$ is convergent for all complex number $\Re s>0$ . Here we only consider the case of real numbers. Let $$A(x)=\sum_{n\leq x}\sin n,$$ then we have that $$A(x)=\frac{\cos\frac{1}{2}-\cos([x]+\frac{1}{2})}{2\sin\frac{1}{2}},$$ here $[x]$ is the floor function. Obviously, $A(x)$ is bounded and $|A(x)|\leq\frac{1}{\sin(1/2)}$ . Using Abel's summation formula, we have that $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{\sin n}{n^s}=s\int_1^\infty\frac{A(x)}{x^{s+1}}\,dx =\frac{\cos\frac{1}{2}}{2\sin\frac{1}{2}}-s\int_1^\infty\frac{\cos([x]+\frac{1}{2})}{x^{s+1}}\,dx.$$ The integral $\int_1^\infty\frac{\cos([x]+\frac{1}{2})}{x^{s+1}}\,dx$ or $\int_1^\infty\frac{\cos([x])}{x^{s+1}}\,dx$ is also convergent for $s>-1$ (am I right? use Dirichlet's test) My question: Is there an easy way to prove $$\lim_{s\to0^+}\int_1^\infty\frac{\cos([x])}{x^{s+1}}\,dx= \int_1^\infty\lim_{s\to0^+}\frac{\cos([x])}{x^{s+1}}\,dx= \int_1^\infty\frac{\cos([x])}{x}\,dx.$$ If the above conclusion is correct, we have that $$\lim_{s\to0^+}\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{\sin n}{n^s}=\frac{\cos\frac{1}{2}}{2\sin\frac{1}{2}}.$$ More generally, consider the Mellin tranform $g(s)=\int_1^\infty\frac{f(x)}{x^{s+1}}\,dx$ , here $f(x)$ is continuous except integers and have left and right limit at integers. If for $s=0$ , the integral $\int_1^\infty\frac{f(x)}{x}\,dx$ is convergent, do we have that $$\lim_{s\to0^+}\int_1^\infty\frac{f(x)}{x^{s+1}}\,dx\stackrel{?}=\int_1^\infty\frac{f(x)}{x}\,dx\,$$ (In Jameson's book The prime number theorem , page 124, there is a Ingham-Newman Tauberian thereom, but the conditions of the theorem there are slightly different from here.) If the condition is strengthened to for all $s\geq-1/2$ , $\int_1^\infty\frac{f(x)}{x^{s+1}}\,dx$ is convergent, is the following correct $$\lim_{s\to0^+}\int_1^\infty\frac{f(x)}{x^{s+1}}\,dx\stackrel{?}=\int_1^\infty\frac{f(x)}{x}\,dx\,$$ If this is correct, is there a simple way to prove it?

Sure, l'Hôpital will work, but that's circular if we're developing calculus of transcendentals from first principles. There is a good answer to this question already by user Neal, but he uses the exponential function with base $e$ (it's been answered many times: see also here , here , and here ). But using the special properties of $e$ strikes me as circular too; not literally logically circular, in the sense that we are invoking results we're trying to prove, since there are definitions of $e^x$ which make it trivial to verify the derivative. But perhaps pedagogically circular for a complete novice, the special properties of $e$ appear unmotivated because they cannot be justified without reference to the very derivative we are trying to compute (or else a detour through logarithms, but let's not). Can we find nice squeeze theorem bounds like Neal has, but for the function $a^x$ instead of $e^x$, with the additional handicap that we can't just write $a^x=e^{x\log a}$? I thought to substitute a series expansion for $\log a$, but didn't come up with any bounds that were nicely polynomial in both $x$ and $a$. I wonder whether the geometric proof of $\lim (\sin x)/x$ (see for example, robjohn's answer here ) could be adapted.

The rest of the development of calculus of exponentials and logs follows easily. This seems like the approach that would appear the most accessible yet motivated to a novice calculus student.

25,"What is ""calculus"" on a manifold?","What is ""calculus"" on a manifold?",,"I guess my question is about interpretation.  My (very rough) understanding of the way we do calculus on a smooth manifold is as follows... A smooth manifold is a topological space without necessarily any metrical structure- therefore, if we speak of ""calculus"" being done on smooth manifolds, then it is a calculus on spaces which are not generally metric.  How then do we define a ""derivative"" for such a calculus?  (In analysis we learn that a derivative is the (limit of) the ratio of distance functions evaluated on elements of two (functionally related) metric spaces.)  And how then do we define the derivative's inverse- the integral?  Now, I know that the objects which are differentiated and integrated on smooth manifolds are not functions, but differential forms.  The theory is developed in such a way that this calculus of forms reduces - via coordinates - to good old calculus of functions on R^n endowed with the Euclidean metric.

Here's my answer. Firstly we can do some identical transformation. $$f(x)=\dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}(\sqrt{(\cos x+1)^2+(\sin x)^2+4}+\sqrt{(\cos x)^2+(\sin x+2)^2+9})$$ So that it makes sense in geometry. $P(\cos x,\sin x)$ is on the circle $x^2+y^2=1$ , and the value of $f(x)$ equals to sum of the distance from $A(0,-2)$ to $P$ and from $B(-1,0)$ to $P$ . In other words: $$f(x)=\dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}(\sqrt{|PB|^2+4}+\sqrt{|PA|^2+9}).$$ And here we can use Minkowski inequality. $$f(x)\geq \dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \sqrt{(|PA|+|PB|)^2+25}$$ When $P$ , $A$ , $B$ is collinear, $RHS$ gets the minimum.

[duplicate],,"This question already has answers here : Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. (2 answers) Closed 7 years ago .

Nope! If you take the derivative of the integral you find that sharp corners cause the derivative to not exist. So then this would mean that the integral of floor is not an antiderivative right?
