I will write here the text of the riddle and my attempt. I just don't get how to proceed further. Seven men, whose names were Adams, Baker, Carter, Dobson, Edwards, Francis, and Gudgeon, were recently engaged in play. The name of the particular game is of no consequence. They had agreed that whenever a player won a game he should double the money of each of the other players—that is, he was to give the players just as much money as they had already in their pockets. They played seven games, and, strange to say, each won a game in turn, in the order in which their names are given. But a more curious coincidence is this—that when they had finished play each of the seven men had exactly the same amount—two shillings and eightpence—in his pocket. The puzzle is to find out how much money each man had with him before he sat down to play. Attempt I started to mind like this: first of all $2$ shillings and $8$ pence are $32$ pence ($1$s = $12$p). Hence at the end they all have $32$ p, which means in total there are $224$ p since there are seven players. Now, Assume the players are called $A B C D E F G$. $A$ is the first and he possesses $a$ pence, hence the other ones, in total, have $R$ pence. The first useful equation is trivial and its $$a + R = 224$$ Now: $A$ wins first, hence he has to pay everyone else twice what they have. But $R$ is what they all have, hence he pays $R$: after the first turn $A$ remains with $a - R$ pence. But then he always loses (other wins), and each turn until the end $A$ gets his sum doubled. In this way the turn are described by: $a - R$ $2(a-R)$ $4(a-R)$ $\cdots$ $64(a.R)$ After seven rounds, $A$ has $64(a-R)$ pence, which must be equal to $32$ since the text says it's what they all have at the end.

Each shelve can hold all of the dolls. It matters which doll is on which shelf, and also the order of the dolls matters. Ex. (ABCD | EFGH | I | JK) is not the same as (ABCD | EFGH | I | KJ ). I have done some research, but everyone in their problems seems to not care about the order, or has more things of a kind. Question a) How could I compute number of possibilities to arrange the dolls, if no constraints are presented? b) Verify my thought process for ""on each shelf must be at least two dolls"" ad b) Using function V(k, n) = n!/(n-k!) I'd choose two dolls for each shelf V(2, 11) * V(2, 9) * V(2, 7) * V(2, 5) and then use the solution of the first problem, only this time for three dolls only. Is this a valid solution or am I an idiot? Thanks",,"['combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics']"

93,A complicated handshake problem,A complicated handshake problem,,"I am struggling with the following problem. Suppose there are two distinct parties having the same number of people.  In the first party, each person shakes hands with every other person in that party exactly once.  Then one person leaves and everyone remaining shakes hands with everyone else once again exactly once.  This procedure continues (i.e. one person leaves after which the remaining people shake hands again) until there are two people remaining, who shake hands once. In the second party, a different handshake game is played.  One person is selected to be VIP and every non-VIP party member shakes hands with the VIP exactly once.  The VIP then leaves the party with one other person and two new people enter the party and both become VIPs.  All non-VIPs shake hands with each of these two VIPs exactly once (the VIPs do not shake with each other).  Then the two VIPs leave with one other person and three new people enter the party and become VIPs, and every non-VIP at the party shakes with each VIP exactly once (VIPs do not shake with each other).
