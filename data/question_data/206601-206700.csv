10,Using polynomials as recursions,Using polynomials as recursions,,"I made this observation in my discrete math course a while back.  I explored it further online, so not all the ideas contained are mine alone.  I still am confused about some things, though.  Consider the equation $x^2-x-1=0$ whose positive root is the golden ratio $\phi$.  Rewriting the equation we get $x^2=x+1$, and for nonzero $x$ we can divide to get $x=1+\frac1x$.  Now $x$ is defined recursively in terms of itself, so plugging it back into this defining equation we get $x=1+\frac1{1+\frac1x}$, and by continuing indefinitely we produce a continued fraction which converges exactly to $\phi$.  Returning to the quadratic, we see also that if $x^2=x+1$, then by taking the square root we have $x=\sqrt{x+1}$; since again $x$ is defined recursively in terms of itself we can plug it back into the equation to get $\sqrt{\sqrt{x+1}+1}$ and so on, to produce an infinitely iterated root that also converges to $\phi$. What is this process/idea called where you find a recursion that 'solves itself'?  By that I mean that we had an expression for $x$ in terms of itself, which can be used iteratively to compute $x$.  How can one recognize that iterated roots or fractions can be rewritten as polynomials and vice versa? Also, I find this argument of 'plugging $x$ into itself' to be very ad-hoc and non-rigorous.

At first glance it looks like half of them.

For example, when $length = 4$ , we have $""aaaa"", ""aaab"", ""aaba"", ""abaa"", ""baaa""$ which is $5$ out of $2^4$ options. For $length = 6$ , we have "" $aaaaaa$ "", $6$ words with $5$ "" $a$ "" and $1$ "" $b$ "", and ${2\choose 6}$ words with $4$ "" $a$ "" and $2$ "" $b$ "".

The problem gives pigeonhole principle vibes, but I'm yet to identify the pigeons and the holes. Regardless, here's my attempt. I'll consider $n=1$ first. Let $A = \{a\}$ and $p$ be a prime. If $p \mid a$ , then $a/p \in \Bbb Z$ , and any choice of $t\in \Bbb Z\setminus p\Bbb Z$ works. Assume $p \not\mid a$ . Then, we can express $a = pk + r$ for $1 \le r \le p -1$ and $k\in \Bbb Z$ .

Now, $r/p$ is in $S_p := \{1/p, 2/p, \ldots, 1 - 1/p\}$ and the fractional part of $rt/p$ for $t\in \Bbb Z\setminus p\Bbb Z$ also lies in $S_p$ . It shall suffice to show that for some $t\in \Bbb Z\setminus p\Bbb Z$ , we have $\{rt/p\} = 1/p$ (or $1 - 1/p$ .) This amounts to solving the congruence $rt \equiv 1 \bmod p$ for $t\in \Bbb Z\setminus p\Bbb Z$ . Since $r \ne 0$ , and $\Bbb Z/p\Bbb Z$ is a field ( $p$ is prime), every non-zero element (in particular, $r$ ) is invertible. So we are done.

52,How do group symmetries work exactly?,How do group symmetries work exactly?,,"Currently in my discrete mathematics course at the university I study at, we are on the topic of permutations and groups. We have learned that a group $G$ can be expressed in terms of a set of generators $S$ like this $G=\langle S\rangle$ such that all elements can be expressed using elements of $S$ and the operation under which $G$ is closed. However, in some examples in our lecture notes and in certain assignments, geometric groups containing a square with vertices $1,2,3,4$ are defined using $\langle (2\text{ }4),(1\text{ }2 \text{ }3 \text{ }4)\rangle$ . I understand that $(2\text{ }4)$ is used to signify reflections, but why the identity permutation is used for signifying rotations is a mystery to me. According to the book, every $90^\circ$ rotation could then be written as $(1\text{ }2\text{ }3\text{ }4)^n$ which seems wrong considering how the identity permutation works. I have looked on the internet for answers but for some reason wikipedia has the exact same definition of a square by its symmetries and I couldn't find anything remotely relevant elsewhere (aside from some article to which I had no access). Is there something I am missing? Wouldn't it make more sense to use the permutation $(4 \text{ }1\text{ }2\text{ }3)$ instead as that alludes to an actual rotation? Edit: first of all, thanks for all the answers so quickly! Secondly, for this course we learned that the single-line notation of permutations was always the same as the double-lined matrix notation except for the first line just being absent such that $$\left(\begin{matrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ \sigma(1) & \sigma(2) & \sigma(3) & \sigma(4)\end{matrix}\right)= (\sigma(1)\text{ }\sigma(2)\text{ }\sigma(3)\text{ }\sigma(4))$$ which probably led to all the confusion as all other examples in lecture notes either used the above added identity, the disjoint cycle notation or the transposition notation.

I think one should be able to let $x_i$ be the label of the $i$ th edge in the Eulerian circuit once the graph is defined properly. It seems in the answer below that there are two outgoing arcs from each vertex, because there's always two values that are ""in range.""

If $v=(m+1)/2, 2v - 1 = m$ and $2v-m$ are in range.

Also, how would one prove this (e.g. by induction on the number of edges perhaps). Why are the incoming arcs to vertex $v$ precisely $(\lfloor (v+1)/2 \rfloor , v), (\lfloor (v+m+1)/2\rfloor, v)$ ? From my understanding, for an incoming arc $(w,v)$ , we need $2w =v, 2w - 1 = v, 2w - m = v$ or $2v - m-1=v$ . If $v$ is odd, then we must have $2w-1=v$ or one of $2v-m-1=v, 2v - m = v$ , depending on whether $m$ is odd or not. Doesn't one require the digraph to be (weakly) connected for all m? And to prove this, perhaps one could show all vertices are reachable from vertex $(1,1+m)$ ? To restore a permutation from the Eulerian cycle, when exactly do we take the number $v$ and when do we take the number $v+m$ ? A small example might help (e.g. $m=3, n=6$ ). Also, just for additional info, I've added a proof of the weak connectivity of the graph (which I'm pretty sure should work regardless of the parity of m). We'll prove the weak connectivity by induction on the vertex number. Let the vertices be $v_1,\cdots, v_m$ , where $v_i$ represents the pair $(i,i+m)$ . We'll prove that $v_1$ can reach all vertices.

67,Probability of getting at least one pair in a combination,Probability of getting at least one pair in a combination,,"Assume that I have 6 symbols which I label $\{x_1,x_2,x_3,y_1,y_2,y_3\}$ . Now I make a random 6-symbol  combination with repetition, such that every combination has the same probability of occuring. For example we could have drawn 2 times $x_1$ , 3 times $y_2$ and 1 time $y_3$ , but we could have also drawn 5 times $x_1$ and 1 time $x_2$ equally likely. The question that I am now interested in is given a random combination with repetition as described above, what is the probability that the combination has at least one $x$ and one $y$ with the same index? Supplementary: What is the probability if we consider a $M$ -symbol combination made from a set of symbols $\{x_1,...,x_N,y_1,...,y_N\}$ ? Edit: It is a problem that I have come up with myself. It is related to a statistical physics problem where the combinations are my microscopic realizations. I tried to tackle it in the following way: The total number of possible combinations with repetition is $\left(\binom{6}{6}\right)=\binom{11}{6}=462$ . Then I thought the easiest way was to calculate the combinations with no $x$ , $y$ pair with the same indices present. Since there may not be any pairs present we need to choose a symbol with index 1, a symbol with index 2 and a symbol with index 3 and make with them a 6-symbol word. We can choose $2^3=8$ of such triples of symbols with each $\left(\binom{3}{6}\right)=\binom{8}{6}=28$ combinations. Wich would give $8\cdot28=224$ combinations or a probability of $p=1-224/462\approx0.515$ . Which is isn't correct because of some extra combinations that I have counted multiple times. However I have no clue how to correct for these extra countings, in a structured way. So I also tried the other approach of directly counting the probability of at least one pair. There are 3 possible pairs. Assume we have drawn the pair $x_1,y_1$ , this has $\left(\binom{6}{4}\right)=\binom{9}{4}=126$ combinations. Then we need the amount of combinations that are not already counted and contain the pair $x_2$ , $y_2$ , naively I could say it is 2 $\left(\binom{5}{4}\right)=2\binom{8}{4}$ , because we can't have a pair with index 1.

Prove that there are 3 of these points that determine a triangle of area at most 68. I think that i can use the generalized pigeonhole principle which i know as: Let $n,m,r$ be integers such that $n>rm$ . If $n$ objects are placed into $m$ boxes, then there is at least one box containing at least $r+1:=\lceil n/m\rceil$ objects. Since $n=169$ and I would like 3 points to fall in the same hole to form a triangle with an area smaller than that of the hole, I take $r=2$ , then $m$ is the largest square less than $\lfloor n/r\rfloor=84$ (This is because when dividing an equilateral triangle into triangles that are also equilateral, I can do it in a square number of them) so $m=81$ . Now by Heron's formula the area of triangle $XYZ$ is $$A=\sqrt{s(s-x)(s-y)(s-z)}$$ Where $s=\frac{x+y+z}{2}$ is the semiperimeter, in this case $x=y=z:=l=100$ , so since $m=81=9^2$ , we are dividing each side into $9$ equal segments, so the side of each small triangle measures $100/9:=b$ . The semiperimeter of the small triangle is $c=\frac{3b}{2}=\frac{50}{3}$ , apply now the Heron's formula $$a=\sqrt{c(c-b)^3}=(c-b)\sqrt{c(c-b)}=\frac{2500}{27\sqrt{3}}\approx53.4583\leq68$$ But i see that it's a bad approximation, so I thought that I could divide the triangle into fewer holes, that is, divide each side into one less space, where $m=64$ and in this way the calculations would be: $b=\frac{25}{2}$ , $c=\frac{75}{4}$ , $$a=\sqrt{c(c-b)^3}=\frac{25^2}{4^2}\sqrt{3}\approx67.6582\leq68$$ Which is a much better approximation, but I don't know how to justify this reasoning, or if I'm thinking it right, I need help.","I have this excercise: 169 points are chosen at random inside an equilateral triangle of perimeter 300.

93,Are these 2 graphs isomorphic (with illustrations and counter examples that appear not to preserve adjacencies)?,Are these 2 graphs isomorphic (with illustrations and counter examples that appear not to preserve adjacencies)?,,"The following labeled slide was presented in a first year discrete mathematics course. However,  the adjacencies don't appear to be preserved (see the second illustration below). If the vertices in the above graph on the left are arbitrarily labeled A to F, and we select the arbitrary vertex A for the vertex labeled A in the graph on the right, there appears to be no way to label the adjacent vertices such that it will not create an edge that connects two vertices (the other two A-adjacent vertices) that are not adjacent in the original graph. Of the 3 nodes that that are connected to vertex A, whichever is chosen to be the endpoint at the bottom right of the supposedly isomorphic graph, will lead to a situation where the other two nodes adjacent to A, will also be adjacent to each other, despite this not being the case in the original graph. If these are really isomorphic, how can the second graph given in the slide preserve all the adjacencies of the original graph? Obviously, the degrees of the vertices and the sum of degrees of the graphs are the same, and the second graph is a bijection of the first, but what about the adjacencies?","The following labeled slide was presented in a first year discrete mathematics course.
