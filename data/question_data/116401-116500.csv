0,pandigital rational approximations to the golden ratio and the base of the natural logarithm,pandigital rational approximations to the golden ratio and the base of the natural logarithm,,"Steven Stadnicki suggested in a comment that I post the following as a question. The golden ration $\phi$ is given by $$\phi = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2} \approx 1.618033988.$$ A rational approximation is given by $$\frac{987}{610} \approx 1.618032787.$$ This yields the following pandigital formulas: $$\frac{4 * 3 + 975}{\left(8 + 2\right) * 61}$$ $$\frac{985 + 2}{1 + 7 * \left(6 + {3}^{4}\right)}$$ $$\frac{5 + 984 - 2}{\left(7 + 3\right) * 61}$$ $$\frac{987}{2 + 1 + \left({5}^{4}\right) - \left(6 * 3\right)}$$ $$\frac{7 * \left(98 + 43\right)}{\left(61 * 5\right) * 2}$$ Is there another pandigital rational representation that yields a higher number of accurate digits? The same question may be asked for the base of the natural logarithm $e$: $$e\approx 2.718281828.$$ A rational approximation is $$\frac{1457}{536}\approx 2.718283582.$$ It produces the following pandigital formulas: $$\frac{31 * \left(5 + 42\right)}{\left(76 - 9\right) * 8}$$ $$\frac{\left(\left({3}^{6}\right) * 2\right) - 1}{\left({5}^{4}\right) - \left(97 - 8\right)}$$ $$\frac{\left(6 * \left({3}^{5}\right)\right) - 1}{7 + {\left(\left(8 * 4\right) - 9\right)}^{2}}$$ $$\frac{1 + \left(6 * \left({3}^{5}\right)\right) - 2}{\left(9 * 7 + 4\right) * 8}$$ $$\frac{31 * \left(8 * 5 + 7\right)}{{2}^{9} + 6 * 4}$$ $$\frac{5 + \left(\left({9}^{3}\right) * 2\right) - 6}{8 * \left(71 - 4\right)}$$ $$\frac{31 * \left(\left(8 * 7\right) - 9\right)}{542 - 6}$$ As before we ask for a better rational approximation that produces a higher precision. Furthermore (see this post ) we ask for a more sophisticated non-trivial algorithm to compute these. I was able to obtain an improvement of the running time by a factor of thirty by re-coding the Maple algorithm from the other post in C, including quite a few ideas that are of use to the combinatorics programmmer, like the representation of sets by bit strings or the enumeration of the permutations of a list using the factorial number system. Happy computing!

There are two variables, I am getting equation of a line! How can I solve this?","I have two points A and B whose coordinates are $(3,4)$ and $(-2,3)$ The third point is C. We need to calculate its coordinates. I think there will be two possible answers, as the point C could be on the either side of line joining A and B. Now I put AB = AC = BC. We calculate AB by distance formula : $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$ = $ \sqrt{5^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{26}$ I plug this value into the distance of AC and BC and finally equate to get : $5x + y = 6$ Now what can I do?
