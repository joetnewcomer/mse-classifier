I was able to get the answer to $2(abc - a^2 d + 2b^2 d)=0$, but the actual answer is $(c^2 - d^2)(abc - a^2 d + 2b^2 d)=0$.  Where does the $(c^2 -d^2)$ come from? UPDATE: I think I know $(c^2-d^2)$ comes from.  If $\theta$ =0, then cos $\theta$ = 1 and in turn cos 2 $\theta$ = 1; plugging these values into the first equation gives us $c = d$. (I already did the second condition where $\frac {a} {2b}$))  If we square the first condition and subtract, that gives us $(c^2-d^2)$; since this also equals $2(abc - a^2 d + 2b^2 d)=0$, we can multiply both sides by $(c^2-d^2)$ to get the final result. UPDATE #2: Actually, the more I thought about it, this is correct. $2) \displaystyle x \cos \theta + y \sin \theta = \cos (3 \theta)$; $x \sin \theta - y \cos \theta = 3 \sin (3 \theta)$ I'm not sure where to start...I've tried squaring both equations, multiplying, etc.  (The answer for this is $\displaystyle(x^2 + y^2)(x^2+y^2+18)+8x(x^2-3y^2) = 27$.)

Thanks for your help!","I have a couple of trigonometric elimination questions for you... $1) a \sin \theta = b \sin (2 \theta)$; $c \cos \theta = d \cos (2 \theta)$ *NOTE: the first equation was incorrect...I had $\cos 2 \theta$ and it should be $\sin 2 \theta$. I was able to get the answer to $2(abc - a^2 d + 2b^2 d)=0$, but the actual answer is $(c^2 - d^2)(abc - a^2 d + 2b^2 d)=0$.  Where does the $(c^2 -d^2)$ come from? UPDATE: I think I know $(c^2-d^2)$ comes from.  If $\theta$ =0, then cos $\theta$ = 1 and in turn cos 2 $\theta$ = 1; plugging these values into the first equation gives us $c = d$. (I already did the second condition where $\frac {a} {2b}$))  If we square the first condition and subtract, that gives us $(c^2-d^2)$; since this also equals $2(abc - a^2 d + 2b^2 d)=0$, we can multiply both sides by $(c^2-d^2)$ to get the final result. UPDATE #2: Actually, the more I thought about it, this is correct. $2) \displaystyle x \cos \theta + y \sin \theta = \cos (3 \theta)$; $x \sin \theta - y \cos \theta = 3 \sin (3 \theta)$ I'm not sure where to start...I've tried squaring both equations, multiplying, etc.  (The answer for this is $\displaystyle(x^2 + y^2)(x^2+y^2+18)+8x(x^2-3y^2) = 27$.) UPDATE: I was able to get the following for x and y (thanks to the suggestion!) $\displaystyle x= 2\cos 2 \theta - \cos 4 \theta$ $\displaystyle y = 2\sin 2 \theta + \sin 4 \theta$ UPDATE 2/16/14: BREAKTHROUGH! Never mind...that answer bombed out. UPDATE 2/17/14: Not giving up and using the advice below, I finally got $\displaystyle c = \frac {(x-1)^2 + (y^2-4)}{12}$...I'm going to plug this in to the equation for x and see how it goes.

But, $\sin{x}$ oscillates between 1 and -1 infinitely over the whole domain $\mathbb{R}$ and hence also its subset, the interval $(-\infty, -1)$. Thus, $\sin{x}$ intersects infinitely with ${x+1 \over x-1}$, at least once each time in its interval of size $\pi$. These intersection points are exactly the roots of $f(x)$ over the interval $\left(-\infty, -1\right)$. Thus, if we choose arbitrary points $a,b < -1 : a - b \ge \pi$, then $\sin{x}$ goes from -1 to 1 at least once, and since ${x+1 \over x-1}$ is always between 0 and 1, the period contains a root of $f(x)$. Thus, to summarize, we have got a function $g(x)$ which is defined over the negative number line, and is bounded and continuous there. On the negative number line, we also have an interval $(a, b)$ where we have a root of given equation. Also, derivative of $g(x)$ is numerically less than one in the given interval.

But the fact that my function $g(x)$ is $\sin^{-1}{{x + 1 \over x - 1}}$ means that any negative value of $x < -1 $yields me a positive value of iterate in the next step, which in turn leads to domain error.

Prove that $$\sum_{i=1}^n\tan\alpha_i\geq (n-1)\cdot \sum_{i=1}^n\cot\alpha_i$$ This is from the final part of the book, where no technique is suggested. I tried using the observation that $n-1 = \sum\sin^2\alpha_i$ , but substituting this into the inequality we obtain the inequality that is false in general (without the assumption $\sum\cos^2\alpha_i=1$ ). My most promising idea is the following. Thanspose the condition into: $$n\cdot \sum_{i=1}^n\cot\alpha_i \leq \sum_{i=1}^n\left(\tan\alpha_i + \cot\alpha_i\right).$$ $$n\cdot \sum_{i=1}^n\cot\alpha_i \leq \sum_{i=1}^n\frac 1{\sin\alpha_i\cdot \cos\alpha_i}.$$ $$n\cdot \sum_{i=1}^n\frac {\cos^2\alpha_i}{\sin\alpha_i\cdot \cos\alpha_i} \leq \sum_{i=1}^n\frac 1{\sin\alpha_i\cdot \cos\alpha_i}.$$ Then we could use Chebyshev's inequality for anti-monotone sequences (I don't know the name in English). Assuming $\alpha_i\leq \alpha_{i+1}$ , the sequence $a_i = \cos^2\alpha_i$ is decreasing and $b_i = 1/(\sin\alpha_i\cos\alpha_i)$ is increasing provided $\alpha_i\geq \pi/4$ . Therefore we have the proof for such angles: $$n\cdot \sum_{i=1}^n\frac {\cos^2\alpha_i}{\sin\alpha_i\cdot \cos\alpha_i} \stackrel{(\star)}\leq \left(\sum_{i=1}^n \cos^2\alpha_i\right)\cdot \sum_{i=1}^n\frac 1{\sin\alpha_i\cdot \cos\alpha_i} = \sum_{i=1}^n\frac 1{\sin\alpha_i\cdot \cos\alpha_i}.$$ Unfortunately, one angle $\alpha_1$ can be smaller than $\pi/4$ and the proof doesn't go. What's more, the inequality (*) also doesn't hold in general (if one angle is smaller than $\pi/4$ ).

65,Behaviour of sine sums,Behaviour of sine sums,,"I was considering the following function $$f_a(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\lfloor x\rfloor}\sin^2(an)$$ and, as expected, $f_a(x)\approx x/2$ for every $a$ (except $2\pi$ and similar). This is because the function $\sin^2(ax)$ is ""on average"" equal to $1/2$ . That is: we are adding $x$ numbers all close to $1/2$ , and if one of them is bigger (than $1/2$ ) then not much later we are going to find another that is smaller (than $1/2$ ), cancelling the effect. At first I thought that the behaviour of $f_a$ would depend on how good of an approximation is $a$ to a rational multiple of $\pi$ (problems of convergence and similar always take this into consideration), but it is not the case. The problem begins when one considers (I found this before the $f_a$ ) the functions $$g_a(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\lfloor x\rfloor}\sin(an)$$ I'm puzzled by these: they are (almost always) approximately equal to $A\sin^2\left(Bx\right)$ , where $A$ and $B$ are, I think, constants (or almost constant) which depend on $a$ . First of all, why does this happen? If $\sin^2(ax)$ is, on average equal to $1/2$ , then $\sin(an)$ is equal to $0$ on average, so we should oberve $g_a\approx0$ always. Instead, $g_a$ is either positive (and oscillating) or negative (also oscillating), except for very few values where it becomes negative (psitive) but very small. So they are, in a sense, ""very positive"" or ""very negative"". Either way, very not zero. Maybe it has to do with the fact that $$\frac{1}{x}\int_0^x\sin^2(at)\,dt$$ converges to $1/2$ but oscillating and $$\frac{1}{x}\int_0^x\sin(at)\,dt$$ converges to $0$ but is always postivie or negative so that, while it is $0$ on average, it is more positive somehow. Can you expalin this phenomenon? Also, this is not the whole story: there are some values of $a$ (for example $a=2.8$ ) for which $g_a$ is ""made"" of two sine waves (like a standing wave), but this time the ""very positive or very negative"" doesn't show up. For some other values ( $a=23$ ), $g_a$ is made up of three sine waves. I suspect this can be explained with the rational approximation thing. Note: (you may want to graph $g_a$ times a big constant like 10 and zoom out to see the various sine waves) Thanks!! Edit: We have the following identity: $$\sin(\varphi)+\sin(\varphi+\alpha)+\sin(\varphi+2\alpha)+\dots+\sin(\varphi+n\alpha)=$$ $$=\frac{\sin\left(\frac{(n+1)\alpha}{2}\right)\sin\left(\frac{n\alpha}{2}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right)}$$ So making $\varphi=0$ and $\alpha=a$ we have a precise expression $$g_a(x)=\frac{\sin\left(\frac{(\lfloor x\rfloor+1) a}{2}\right)\sin\left(\frac{\lfloor x\rfloor a}{2}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{a}{2}\right)}$$ Which looks similar enough to $A\sin^2(Bx)$ . This does not solve the "" $\sin$ 's average is $0$ so $g_a$ should be $0$ "". Also, and I find this very curious, if we substitute $\lfloor x\rfloor$ for $x$ in the formula we get a completely different function, and the ""made up of various sine waves for some choices of $a$ "" is far from clear from the formula. I'm guessing its a ""how synched"" the two waves in the numerator are: if they are very very similar then their product is very similar to $\sin^2$ . This explains the ""very positive"" or ""very negative"", but no more, because the periods are $a/2$ for both waves. Another observation: if we use $\cos$ instead, the opposite phenomenon occurs.

You can then write $x^2-1=(x+1)(x-1)$ Can we do the same with trigonmetric functions, i.e sin$x=0 \implies x=n\pi$ so sin$x=x(x-\pi)(x+\pi)(x-2\pi)(x+2\pi)...$","In order to factorise $x^2-1$ one way of thinking about it would be to set it equal to zero and solve to get $x=1$ and $x=-1$.
