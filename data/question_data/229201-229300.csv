1,Weaker assumptions to define an equivalence relation,Weaker assumptions to define an equivalence relation,,"Given a set $A$ , the standard definition (at least Wikipedia's one) says that a binary relation $\sim$ on $A$ is an equivalence relation iff: $\forall a\in A \quad a\sim a\quad$ (reflexivity); $\forall a,b\in A\quad a\sim b\;\implies\; b\sim a\quad$ (symmetry); $\forall a,b,c\in A\quad a\sim b$ and $b\sim c\;\implies a\sim c\quad$ (transitivity). I had been believing for a while that the first assumption (reflexivity) was unnecessary, given the other two. Indeed, if $a\sim b$ , then $b\sim a$ by symmetry, and by transitivity $a\sim a$ . However, I've then realised that actually these two conditions are not enough. Indeed, taking $A=\mathbb R$ and $a\sim b$ iff $ab>0$ we get that $0$ is not equivalent to $0$ , and so the reflexivity does not hold. The issue in the above example is that in order to use the symmetry and the transitivity to show the reflexivity for an element $a$ , we must assume that there exists an element $b\in A$ such that $a\sim b$ or $b\sim a$ . This observation leads to the following alternative definition. $\sim$ is an equivalence relation on $A$ iff: $\forall a\in A \quad \exists b:a\sim b$ or $b\sim a\quad$ (existence); $\forall a,b\in A\quad a\sim b\;\implies\; b\sim a\quad$ (symmetry); $\forall a,b,c\in A\quad a\sim b$ and $b\sim c\;\implies a\sim c\quad$ (transitivity). The two definitions are equivalent, but the single existence condition, without symmetry and transitivity, is weaker than the reflexivity assumption, as the latter implies the former. Are there other ways to make the assumptions in this definition weaker? By this I mean, is it possible to replace the existence, the symmetry or the transitivity with a weaker assumption (or possibly a set of weaker assumptions), and still recover the equivalence relation? Alternatively, if this is already a ""minimal"" definition (in the sense that none of the conditions can be replaced by a weaker one) can we find other weaker definitions of equivalence relation by relaxing the symmetry and transitivity? Is it possible to state all the ""minimal"" definitions of equivalence relation? Disclaimer: I am not familiar at all with mathematical logic. I believe this question fits in the logic tag, but if this is not the case please feel free to change it. When I speak about ""minimal definition"" I intuitively mean that each assumption $\alpha$ in the definition cannot be replaced by a weaker set of assumptions $\{\alpha'_i\}$ (where each $\alpha'_i$ is implied by $\alpha$ , but alone does not implies $\alpha$ ) which still leads to the same definition.

2,What is the intuition behind this proof of Silver's Theorem?,What is the intuition behind this proof of Silver's Theorem?,,"Context There is a well-known result on the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis for singular cardinals : Silver's Theorem: Let $\aleph _{\lambda }$ be a singular cardinal such that its cofinality is greater than $\omega$ . If for every $\alpha < \lambda$ , $2^{\aleph _{\alpha }}=\aleph _{\alpha +1}$ , then $2^{\aleph _{\lambda }}=\aleph _{\lambda +1}$ . Proof Sketch: For simplicity, let us assume that $\lambda = \omega _1$ , the first uncountable ordinal number. For each $\alpha < \omega _1$ , let $A_{\alpha }= \mathcal{P}(\omega _{\alpha })$ , so $|A_{\alpha }|=2^{\aleph _{\alpha }}=\aleph _{\alpha +1}$ . For every set $X \subseteq \omega _{\omega _1}$ , let $f_X \in \prod _{\alpha < \omega _1}A_ {\alpha }$ be the function defined by $$f_X (\alpha )= X \cap \omega _{\alpha }.$$ The set $F= \{ f_X \mid X \in \mathcal{P} (\omega _{\omega _1}) \}$ is a family of almost disjoint functions, meaning that for any $f_X$ and $f_Y$ in $F$ there is some $\alpha < \omega _1$ such that $f(\beta ) \neq g(\beta )$ for all $\beta \ge \alpha$ . Now, let $U$ be an ultrafilter on $\omega _1$ that extends the closed unbounded filter . Thus every set $S \in U$ is stationary . Let us define a relation $<$ on $F$ as follows: $$f < g \quad \text{if and only if} \quad \{ \alpha < \omega _1 \mid f(\alpha ) < g(\alpha ) \} \in U.$$ It can be shown that $<$ is a linear ordering on $F$ . Now, if $f,g \in F$ and $g <f$ , then $g \in F_f$ , where $$F_f=\{ g \in F \mid \text{for some stationary } T, g(\alpha ) < f( \alpha ) \text{ for all } \alpha \in T \}.$$ By a slight modification of the following lemma, $|F_f| \le \aleph _{\omega _1}$ . Thus for every $f \in F$ , $|\{ g \in F \mid g < f \}| \le \aleph _{\omega _1}$ . As $<$ is a linear ordering of the set $F$ , it follows that $|F| \le \aleph _{\omega _1 +1}$ . Therefore, $2^{\aleph _{\omega _1}}=\aleph _{\omega _1 +1}$ . Lemma: Let $\{ A_{\alpha } \mid \alpha < \omega _1 \}$ be a family of sets such that $|A_{\alpha }| \le \aleph _{\alpha }$ for every $\alpha < \omega _1$ , and let $F$ be a family of almost disjoint functions, $$F \subset \prod _{\alpha < \omega _1} A_{\alpha }.$$ Then $|F| \le \aleph _{\omega _1}$ . This lemma can be proved as follows. Let $S_0$ be the set of all limit ordinals $0 < \alpha < \omega _1$ . For $f\in F$ and and $\alpha \in S_0$ , let $f^{*}(\alpha )$ denote the least $\beta$ such that $f( \alpha ) < \omega _{\beta }$ . As $f^{*}(\alpha ) < \alpha$ for every $\alpha \in S_0$ , there exists, by Fodor's Lemma , a stationary set $S \subset S_0$ such that $f^{*}$ is constant on $S$ . Therefore $f$ restricted to $S$ is a function from $S$ into $\omega _{\beta }$ , for some $\beta < \omega _1$ , which is denoted by $\varphi (f)$ . It can be shown that $\varphi$ is a one-to-one mapping from $F$ into the set of functions defined on a subset $S$ of $\omega _1$ into some $\omega _{beta} < \omega _{\omega _1}$ . Thus we have $$|F| \le 2^{\aleph _1} \cdot \sum _{\beta < \omega _1} \aleph _{\beta } ^{\aleph _1} \le \aleph _{\omega _1}.$$ Question I have no question about details of the proof. However, I cannot understand how such a proof can come into one's mind from scratch; this proof does not seem intuitive and natural to me at all . What background and idea leads a one to such a proof? What is the intuition behind the proof? What were being thought when someone went to prove this? I have the fish; please teach me how to fish.

I think that the standard way to express the above statement is to use model theory. Suppose we are working in ZFC. My understanding of model theory is a bit weak, but I think this amounts to taking the signature of ZFC and its theory, extending the signature with an ordered pair function symbol, and extending the theory with the characteristic property of ordered pairs. We then show that original ZFC with an ordered pair defined as a Kuratowski pair is a model of our extended signature + theory.

Morevoer I would like to take it as an opportunity to find out how to write proof with equalities, because I tend in those cases to write them in a cumbersome way, with necessary and sufficient conditions. [I assume that this is partly due to the influence of ""How to prove it: a structured approach"", a book that I loved, but that left me the tendency to be quite mechanical in proving any sort of result].

Prove that, for any (nonempty) classes $\mathcal{A} \subseteq 2^X$, we have  $ f(\cup \mathcal{A}) = \cup \{f(A):A \in \mathcal{A} \} $ Here, it's how I approach the problem.

Let $f$ be an arbitrary function that maps from $X$ to $Y$ and let $\mathcal{A}$ be a family of sets, subset of the powerset of $X$. By $(*)$, the result we have to prove becomes $$ \{f(x):x \in \cup \mathcal{A} \} = \cup \{ f(A):A \in \mathcal{A}\} \hspace{1cm} (1)$$ In order to prove it, rephrase $(1)$ as $$ \forall y ( y \in \{f(x):x \in \cup \mathcal{A} \} \leftrightarrow y \in \cup \{ f(A):A \in \mathcal{A}\}). \hspace{1cm} (2)$$ We start by proving the necessary condition. Let $y$ be an arbitrary element and assume that $y$ is a member of $\{f(x):x \in \cup \mathcal{A} \}$. This means that $\exists x(x \in \cup \mathcal{A} \land y=x)$. At the same time, we have to prove that $\exists A(A \in \mathcal{A} \land y\in f(A))$. And here I got stuck... I really don't see how from my premises I can get the desired result.

Morevoer I would like to take it as an opportunity to find out how to write proof with equalities, because I tend in those cases to write them in a cumbersome way, with necessary and sufficient conditions. [I assume that this is partly due to the influence of ""How to prove it: a structured approach"", a book that I loved, but that left me the tendency to be quite mechanical in proving any sort of result]. Theorem: Let $X$ and $Y$ be nonempty sets and $f \in Y^X$. Prove that, for any (nonempty) classes $\mathcal{A} \subseteq 2^X$, we have  $ f(\cup \mathcal{A}) = \cup \{f(A):A \in \mathcal{A} \} $ Here, it's how I approach the problem. Tentative Proof: First of all, by definition of (direct) image of a function, we have  $$f(\cup \mathcal{A}) := \{f(x):x\in \cup \mathcal{A} \}. \hspace{1cm} (*)$$ Let $X$, $Y$ be arbitrary (nonempty) sets. Let $f$ be an arbitrary function that maps from $X$ to $Y$ and let $\mathcal{A}$ be a family of sets, subset of the powerset of $X$. By $(*)$, the result we have to prove becomes $$ \{f(x):x \in \cup \mathcal{A} \} = \cup \{ f(A):A \in \mathcal{A}\} \hspace{1cm} (1)$$ In order to prove it, rephrase $(1)$ as $$ \forall y ( y \in \{f(x):x \in \cup \mathcal{A} \} \leftrightarrow y \in \cup \{ f(A):A \in \mathcal{A}\}). \hspace{1cm} (2)$$ We start by proving the necessary condition. Let $y$ be an arbitrary element and assume that $y$ is a member of $\{f(x):x \in \cup \mathcal{A} \}$. This means that $\exists x(x \in \cup \mathcal{A} \land y=x)$. At the same time, we have to prove that $\exists A(A \in \mathcal{A} \land y\in f(A))$. And here I got stuck... I really don't see how from my premises I can get the desired result. Indeed, what $A$ should be? I assume there is a problem with the way in which I translate the problem in logical terms.",,['elementary-set-theory']

(I'm sorry, writing this on a smartphone I find it hard to produce a nicely named link, a good qoute, and a good credit to the quoted author...) Quoting: I haven't seen the following proof mentioned, which I learned from Hai Dang at Mississippi State. Suppose the reals are countable, and let $a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots$ be an enumeration. For each $j$ , let $I_j$ be an interval centered at $a_j$ and having length $1 / 2^j$ . Since the sequence $\{a_j\} $ enumerates the reals, it follows that $$  \bigcup_{j=1}^\infty I_j = \mathbb{R}.   $$ But since the sum of the lengths of the $ I_j $ is the geometric series $$ \sum_{j=1}^\infty  \frac{1}{2^j} = 1, $$ this is nonsense. Please carefully consider the following modification. Let $ a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots $ be a complete enumeration of all rational numbers. For each $ j $ , let $ I_j $ be an interval of real numbers centered at $ a_j $ and having length $ 1 / 2^j $ . Now, since the rational numbers are dense , and every interval has length $ >0 $ , every such interval $ I_j $ includes an infinite number of rational numbers to both sides of $ a_j$ . Since every rational number is being enumerated and assigned an interval, it is inevitable that all intervals will overlap with other intervals in both ends, and any gaps are impossible. It follows that $$ \bigcup_{j=1}^\infty I_j = \mathbb{R}. $$ This is the interval $(-\infty, \infty)$ , clearly of infinite size or length (using the standard measure on real intervals). But at the same time, the sum of the lengths of the $ I_j $ is the sum of the geometric series $$ \sum_{j=1}^\infty\frac{1}{2^j} = 1,$$ and furthermore due to the overlaps, the actual accumulated length will be $ <1 $ . Contradiction! Accumulated length of intervals is infinite and within $[1/2, 1)$ . It seems to me that above is a proof by contradiction that the rational numbers are not countable after all.

Consider putting an $\epsilon$ -surrounding (a symmetric interval of size $2\epsilon, \epsilon>0$ ) around every rational number. Let's say $\epsilon=0.1$ for a start.
