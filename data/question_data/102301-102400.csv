26,Most Economical Description of Two Lines in $\mathbb{P}^{3}$,Most Economical Description of Two Lines in,\mathbb{P}^{3},"I have two lines $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$ in $\mathbb{P}^{3}$, and in one case they intersect while in the other they are skew.  I am wanting to do a computation which involves writing them out explicitly in coordinates and I'm hoping to use projective linear transformations to describe the two lines as economically as possible.  I have an idea that I was hoping someone may critique or fix! Let $(x_{0}:x_{1}:x_{2}:x_{3})$ be coordinates on $\mathbb{P}^{3}$.  Now, we can most certainly use the automorphisms of $\mathbb{P}^{3}$, namely $\rm{PGL}_{4}(\mathbb{C})$, to describe one of the two lines as $$L_{1}: \{x_{2}=0, x_{3}=0\}.$$ Now, in general, the second line will be the complete intersection of two hyperplanes like $a_{0}x_{0}+a_{1}x_{1}+a_{2}x_{2}+a_{3}x_{3}=0$ and $b_{0}x_{0}+b_{1}x_{1}+b_{2}x_{2}+b_{3}x_{3}=0$.  Ideally, I would like to make these a lot simpler if at all possible! My idea is that maybe $\rm{PGL}_{4}(\mathbb{C})$ contains a subgroup like $\rm{PGL}_{2}(\mathbb{C})$ which actually fixes the first line $L_{1}$.  Then, maybe I can use this subgroup to make at least some of the $a_{i}$ and $b_{i}$ zero.  For example, I think I should at least be able to make $L_{2}$ be given by $\{x_{1}=0\}$ plus another hyperplane vanishing. So my question is, can this actually be done, and maybe it can even be done nicer than I described above?  Does the two lines intersecting or not play any role in this simplification?  My main worry is that I know a lot of intuition which comes from three-(real) dimensions is completely ""accidental"" so maybe in four-dimensions ($\mathbb{P}^{3} = \mathbb{P}(\mathbb{C}^{4})$), we can't make sense of a rotation around a fixed plane, leaving that plane fixed.","I have two lines $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$ in $\mathbb{P}^{3}$, and in one case they intersect while in the other they are skew.

If you walk on the wet sand you can walk much more quickly than if you walked on the dry sand. I have a question that discusses this principal. On a Cartesian $xy$ plane limited by: Domain: {$x|0 \le x \le 1$} Range: {$y|0 \le y \le 1$} you start at the point ($0,0$) and you would like to travel on a defined path to ($1,1$) in the shortest amount of time. This sounds simple just take the path $y=x$ because it is the shortest path so it will take the shortest amount of time, but there is a catch. Your forward speed $\frac{dS}{dt}$ is equal to ($1−\frac{3}{4}y$). With this constraint in mind the path $y=x$ would not be the fastest path. What is the fastest path.

As for the normal calculations, I'm really lost, I'm not even sure there is a general case way to calculate the normals. So, I'd love some help on how to calculate the intersection and normal of some of these shapes, and any sort of general case rules for these calculations would be fantastic. Update While real general case solutions would be super awesome, it's ok to assume the shapes are in their standard orientation, not rotated or transformed at all - just positioned and (maybe) scaled. This make the problem much simpler, I believe. If there are other limitations you can use to make the problem even simpler, that's likely fine.",,"['geometry', 'algebra-precalculus', 'algebraic-geometry']"

99,Extending the Law of Cosines formula to quadrilaterals (and even polygon?),Extending the Law of Cosines formula to quadrilaterals (and even polygon?),,"Let's take a look back at this familiar ""Law of cosines"": ‎Consider‎ the ‎triangle ‎ $\triangle‎‎ ABC$ . Let $a = BC, b = AC, c = AB$ ; $\angle A, \angle B, \angle C$ are the angles of the triangle opposite to side $a, b, c,$ respectively. By the Law of Cosines: $$a^{2‎} = b^{2‎} + c^{2‎} - 2bc \cdot \cos \angle A$$ This formula can apply for any triangle. But what about quadrilaterals? Is there a formula, which shows the relationship between sides and angles, similar to the Law of Cosines? Can we extend the Law of Cosines??? This is the way to approach the formula for quadrilaterals ( It's not (really) a proof ): Given the quadrilateral ABCD. Let $a = BC, b = CD, c = AB, d = AD$ . Let $E = AB \cap CD$ and $G = AC \cap BD$ Let consider $\triangle ABC$ as a ""special quadrilateral"" (where $d=0$ ). Then by the Law of Cosines: $$a^{2‎} = b^{2‎} + c^{2‎} - 2bc \cdot \cos \angle BEC = b^{2‎} + c^{2‎} - 2bc \cdot \cos \angle BGC$$ (because when $d=0$ , $E \equiv G \equiv A \Rightarrow \angle BEC = \angle BGC$ ) Notice that when $d=0$ then $CA = CD = CE = b$ ; $BD = BE = BA = c$ . So we can guess the general formula for a quadrilateral will be one of these two formulas: $$ a^{2‎} + Kd^{2‎} = b^{2‎} + c^{2‎} - 2 \cdot BE \cdot CE \cdot \cos \angle BEC \text{ (1)}$$ $$ a^{2‎} + Kd^{2‎} = b^{2‎} + c^{2‎} - 2 \cdot BD \cdot CA \cdot \cos \angle BGC \text{ (2)}$$ (where $K$ is a constant) The reason we add $Kd^{2‎}$ is to make the formula homogeneous (since the Law of Cosines is also homogeneous), and when $d=0$ , the $Kd^{2‎}$ term is gone. Moreover, from our intuition, if the formula contains $\angle BEC$ , then two sides, which multiply to its cosines, have to be $BE$ and $CE$ . Otherwise, those two sides will be $BD$ and $CA$ multiplied by $\cos \angle BGC$ To see which one is possibly correct, we can try to apply the formula to a special quadrilateral: square. In a square, $a=b=c=d$ , "" $BE = CE = \infty$ "", "" $\angle BEC = \infty$ "", $\angle BGC = 90^{\circ}$ . Apply $(1)$ and $(2)$ : $$(1): a^{2‎} + Ka^{2‎} = a^{2‎} + a^{2‎} - \infty$$ $$(2): a^{2‎} + Ka^{2‎} = a^{2‎} + a^{2‎}$$ $(1)$ is definitely wrong. The formula $(2)$ can be true if $K=1$ , so let re-written it: $$a^{2‎} + d^{2‎} = b^{2‎} + c^{2‎} - 2 \cdot BD \cdot CA \cdot \cos \angle BGC$$ To be sure that this formula is correct, let's apply this in another quadrilateral. This time is a rectangle, where $\angle BGC = 60^{\circ}$ . We have $a=d, b=c=a\sqrt{3}$ , $BD = AC = 2a$ . Apply the formula that we've just found, we get: $$a^{2‎} + a^{2‎} = 3a^{2‎} + 3a^{2‎} - 2 \cdot 4a^{2‎} \cdot \frac{1}{2}$$ And this is true. You can verify it with some other quadrilaterals, and it'll also true. So, our new extended ""Law of Cosines"" is: $$a^{2‎} + d^{2‎} = b^{2‎} + c^{2‎} - 2 \cdot BD \cdot CA \cdot \cos \angle BGC$$ So that seems fine. But Is there a proof of the formula above ? Now, my main question (and my main focus) is: Can we extend the formula (find a general formula) for polygons with n sides ? This question is what I'm looking for ( This isn't a homework question ). I'm really curious about this. If you have an answer (or just an idea) to approach, please provide it.

By the Law of Cosines: This formula can apply for any triangle. But what about quadrilaterals? Is there a formula, which shows the relationship between sides and angles, similar to the Law of Cosines? Can we extend the Law of Cosines??? This is the way to approach the formula for quadrilaterals ( It's not (really) a proof ): Given the quadrilateral ABCD. Let . Let and Let consider as a ""special quadrilateral"" (where ). Then by the Law of Cosines: (because when , ) Notice that when then ; . So we can guess the general formula for a quadrilateral will be one of these two formulas: (where is a constant) The reason we add is to make the formula homogeneous (since the Law of Cosines is also homogeneous), and when , the term is gone. Moreover, from our intuition, if the formula contains , then two sides, which multiply to its cosines, have to be and . Otherwise, those two sides will be and multiplied by To see which one is possibly correct, we can try to apply the formula to a special quadrilateral: square. In a square, , "" "", "" "", . Apply and : is definitely wrong. The formula can be true if , so let re-written it: To be sure that this formula is correct, let's apply this in another quadrilateral. This time is a rectangle, where . We have , . Apply the formula that we've just found, we get: And this is true. You can verify it with some other quadrilaterals, and it'll also true. So, our new extended ""Law of Cosines"" is: So that seems fine. But Is there a proof of the formula above ? Now, my main question (and my main focus) is: Can we extend the formula (find a general formula) for polygons with n sides ? This question is what I'm looking for ( This isn't a homework question ). I'm really curious about this. If you have an answer (or just an idea) to approach, please provide it.
