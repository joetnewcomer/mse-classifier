2,Do Carmo's definition of line of striction: Is proof of independence on directrix really needed?,Do Carmo's definition of line of striction: Is proof of independence on directrix really needed?,,"I have a question about Do Carmo's treatment of ruled surfaces in his classic Differential geometry of curves and surfaces . At pages 193–194 (I have Dover's edition) he defines the line of striction of a ruled surface. To such end, he considers the ruled parametrization \begin{align} x \,\colon I \times \mathbb{R} &\to \mathbb{R}^{3}\\ (t,v) &\mapsto \alpha(t) + v w(t), \end{align} where $\alpha$ is a smooth curve in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ and $w$ a smooth unit vector field along $\alpha$ such that $w'(t)\neq 0$ for all $t\in I$ . He thus searches for a ""parametrized curve $\beta(t)$ such that $\langle \beta'(t),w'(t)\rangle =0$ , $t\in I$ , and $\beta(t)$ lies on the trace of $x$ "" (such curve is called the line of striction ); in particular, he notes that $\beta$ lying on the trace of $x$ is equivalent to the existence of a function $u = u(t)$ such that \begin{equation}\tag{1}\label{eq1} \beta(t)= \alpha(t)+ u(t)w(t). \end{equation} All good so far. However, as soon as he has found such a curve, he goes on to prove that "" the curve $\beta$ does not depend on the choice of the directrix $\alpha$ for the ruled surface. "" [emphasis added] Question : Why do we need to prove that $\beta$ does not depend on $\alpha$ ? EDIT: In reply to Ted Shifrin's comment, and to make the question self-contained, I am adding the proof of existence. By definition of line of striction, we need to find a curve in the image of $x$ that is everywhere orthogonal to $w'$ . As already mentioned, a curve $\beta$ is in the image of $x$ if and only if equation \eqref{eq1} holds for some function $u=u(t)$ . Differentiating \eqref{eq1} and dotting with $w'$ , we obtain \begin{align} \beta'&= \alpha'+ u'w+uw',\\ \langle \beta',w' \rangle &= \langle \alpha',w'\rangle + u \langle w',w' \rangle. \end{align} From the last equation, we observe that the curve $\beta$ satisfies $\langle \beta'(t),w'(t)\rangle =0$ for all $t \in I$ exactly when \begin{equation} u=-\frac{\langle\alpha',w'\rangle}{\langle w',w' \rangle}. \end{equation} Hence, we conclude that the desired curve is given by \begin{equation} \beta=\alpha-\frac{\langle\alpha',w'\rangle}{\langle w',w' \rangle} w. \end{equation} EDIT 2: If I had to prove independence on $\alpha$ , then I would do it as follows, without using the final expression of $\beta$ . Suppose that, for another directrix, the line of striction is different from $\beta$ . Then there are two lines of striction, say $\beta_{1}$ and $\beta_{2}$ . It follows that there exist two functions $u_{1}$ , $u_{2}$ of $t$ such that $\beta_{i}=\alpha+u_{i} w$ , with $i=1,2$ . However, both of them are orthogonal to the same $w'$ ; as explained below, this fact implies $u_{1}=u_{2}$ . Differentiating $\beta_{i}= \alpha + u_{i} w$ , we obtain $\beta_{i}'= \alpha' + u_{i}' w+u_{i}w'$ , which in turn implies $\langle \beta_{i}',w'\rangle= \langle\alpha',w'\rangle + u_{i} \langle w',w'\rangle$ . Since $\langle \beta_{1}',w'\rangle = \langle \beta_{2}',w'\rangle=0$ , it follows that $\langle\alpha',w'\rangle + u_{1} \langle w',w'\rangle = \langle\alpha',w'\rangle + u_{2} \langle w',w'\rangle$ , from which one concludes that $(u_{1}-u_{2}) \langle w',w'\rangle=0$ .

Let $H\le G$ be a subgroup of $G$ , and let $\mathfrak h$ be its Lie algebra. Denote with $\mathfrak h^\perp$ the orthogonal complement of $\mathfrak h$ with respect to some inner product.

Observe that there is a neighbourhood of $I\in G$ all the elements of which can be uniquely represented as $h e^\xi$ for some $h\in H$ and $\xi\in\mathfrak h^\perp$ . This implies that for all $i$ large enough, there are unique $h_i'\in H$ and $\xi_i\in\mathfrak h^\perp$ (taken in suitable neighbourhoods of $I\in H$ and $0\in\mathfrak h^\perp$ , respectively) such that $g=h_i h_i' e^{\xi_i}$ . Observe that any $\xi,\xi'\in\mathfrak h^\perp$ with small enough norm and such that $e^\xi e^{-\xi'}\in H$ must be equal: $\xi=\xi'$ . Because $\xi_i\to 0$ , conclude that for large enough $i$ we must have $\xi_i=0$ , and thus $g=h_i h_i'\in H$ . What I'm trying to understand better is the role of $\mathfrak h^\perp$ in this reasoning.

10,Expressing complexified tangent bundle of a spin 4-manifold as a Hom bundle,Expressing complexified tangent bundle of a spin 4-manifold as a Hom bundle,,"I am reading Moore's book Lectures on Seiberg-Witten Invariants , section 2.2. First here are some defintions that the book uses. The group $\operatorname{Spin}(4)$ is defined to be the product group $SU(2)\times SU(2)$ . Let $V$ be the 4-dimensional $\Bbb R$ -algebra with $\Bbb R$ -basis $\textbf{1}=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}, \textbf{i}=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1\\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \textbf{j}=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \textbf{k}=\begin{bmatrix} i & 0 \\ 0 & -i \end{bmatrix} $ . Thus $V$ consists of $2\times 2$ complex matrices of the form $\begin{bmatrix} a & -\bar{b} \\ b & \bar{a} \end{bmatrix}$ . Define $\rho:\text{Spin}(4)\to GL(V)$ by $\rho(A,B)(Q)=BQA^{-1}$ . If we identify $V$ and $\Bbb R^4$ (as $\Bbb R$ -vector spaces) by $\textbf{1}\leftrightarrow (1,0,0,0), \textbf{k}\leftrightarrow (0,1,0,0), \textbf{i}\leftrightarrow (0,0,1,0), \textbf{j}\leftrightarrow (0,0,0,1) $ , it can be seen that $\rho$ maps $\text{Spin}(4)$ into $SO(4)$ . Also let $\rho_+, \rho_-:\text{Spin}(4)\to SU(2)$ be the projections onto first and second components, respectively. Lastly, here is the definition of a spin structure on a 4-manifold. Suppose $M$ is an oriented Riemannian manifold of dimension $4$ . Then we can choose trivializing open cover $\{U_\alpha\}$ for $TM$ such that the corresponding transition functions $g_{\alpha\beta}$ take values in $SO(4)$ . A spin structure on $M$ is collection of maps $\tilde{g}_{\alpha\beta}:U_\alpha \cap U_\beta \to \text{Spin}(4)$ such that $\rho \circ \tilde{g}_{\alpha\beta}=g_{\alpha\beta}$ and $\tilde{g}_{\alpha\beta}\tilde{g}_{\beta\gamma}=\tilde{g}_{\alpha\gamma}$ . Now here is my question. Suppose we are given a spin structure on $M$ . Considering $\{\rho_+\circ \tilde{g}_{\alpha\beta}:U_\alpha\cap U_\beta \to SU(2)\}$ and $\{\rho_-\circ \tilde{g}_{\alpha\beta}:U_\alpha\cap U_\beta \to SU(2)\}$ , we get two $\Bbb C^2$ -bundles $W_+$ and $W_-$ over $M$ . The book is claiming that the complexified tangent bundle $TM\otimes \Bbb C$ is isomorphic to the bundle $E:=\text{Hom}_{\Bbb C}(W_+,W_-)$ , but I can't see why. Why are these two bundles are isomorphic? I think comparing transition functions is an appropriate approach. First, the bundle $TM\otimes \Bbb C$ has transition functions $g_{\alpha\beta}$ .

Since $A_{\alpha\beta}$ take values in $SU(2)$ , $((A_{\alpha\beta})^{-1})^T=(A_{\alpha\beta}^*)^T=\overline{A_{\alpha\beta}}$ .

11,Does a continuous map from $\mathbb{R}^n$ into an infinite dimensional Hilbert space define a manifold?,Does a continuous map from  into an infinite dimensional Hilbert space define a manifold?,\mathbb{R}^n,"Let $H$ be an infinite dimensional Hilbert space with inner product $\langle \cdot, \cdot\rangle$ and norm $\|\cdot\|_H$ . This norm induces a distance on $H$ given by $$ \forall p,q\in H \ d_H(q,p)=\|q-p\|_H $$ Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be compact and $f$ be a map $$ f: \Omega \longrightarrow H $$ such that it is continuous with respect to the euclidean standard metric $d_E$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and the metric $d_H$ in $H$ .

If $f$ is neither an injection or a surjection, can the image of $\Omega$ under $f$ be endowed with a manifold structure? Is there a more convenient topology on $H$ that allows to define a manifold?

The comment referred to a proposition in Abraham, Marsden, Ratiu, Manifolds, Tensor Analysis, and Applications (hereafter AMR). In the second edition, it is Proposition 5.2.20 and in the third edition it is Proposition 6.2.20. A complete understanding of the AMR proposition would be useful in addressing the referred to question. Proposition. Let $M$ be a finite-dimensional manifold or be modeled on a Banach space with norm $C^\infty$ away from the origin. Then $\mathcal{T}^r_s(M)$ is isomorphic to $\mathfrak{T}^r_s(M)$ regarded as $\mathcal{F}(M)$ -modules and as real vector spaces. In particular $\mathfrak{X}^*(M)$ is isomorphic to $\mathcal{X}^*(M)$ . [Before citing the proof, here are the definitions given just before the proposition: $$L_{\mathcal{F}(M)}(\mathfrak{X}(M),\mathcal{F}(M))=\mathcal{X}^*(M)$$ the $\mathcal{F}(M)$ -linear mappings on $\mathfrak{X}(M)$ , and similarly \begin{equation*}   \mathfrak{T}^r_s(M)=L^{r+s}_{\mathcal{F}(M)}(\mathcal{X}^*(M),\dots,\mathfrak{X}(M);   \mathcal{F}(M)) \end{equation*} the $\mathcal{F}(M)$ -multilinear mappings. I'm pretty certain there is a typo (theirs, not mine) in that last display. It would make far more sense if the definition was \begin{equation*}   \mathfrak{T}^r_s(M)=L^{r+s}_{\mathcal{F}(M)}(\mathfrak{X}^*(M),\dots,\mathfrak{X}(M);   \mathcal{F}(M)) \end{equation*} where all I did was change the font from calligraphic to fraktur on the first of the $r+s$ elements listed. This same typo exists in both the second and third editions. I'll assume this latter display is the correct one.] Proof. Consider the map $\mathcal{T}^r_s(M)\to\mathfrak{T}^r_s(M)$ given by \begin{equation*}   \ell(\alpha^1,\dots,\alpha^r,X_1,\dots,X_s)(m)=\ell(m)(\alpha^1(m),\dots,X_s(m)). \end{equation*} [EDIT: It seems to me that it would make more sense notationally if the right hand side $\ell$ was actually $t$ .] This map is clearly $\mathcal{F}(M)$ -linear. To show it is an isomorphism, given such a multilinear map $\ell$ , define $t$ by \begin{equation*}   t(m)(\alpha^1(m),\dots,X_s(m))=\ell(\alpha^1,\dots,X_s)(m). \end{equation*} To show that $t$ is well-defined we first show that, for each $v_0\in T_mM$ , there is an $X\in\mathfrak{X}(M)$ such that $X(m)=v_0$ , and similarly for dual vectors. Let $(U,\phi)$ be a chart at $m$ and let $T_m\varphi(v_0)=(\varphi(m),v_0')$ . Define $Y\in\mathfrak{X}(U')$ by $Y(u)=(u',v_0')$ on a neighborhood $V_1$ of $\varphi(m)$ , where $w=\varphi(n)$ . [I have to believe there are a couple of AMR typos there. I think the $w=\varphi(n)$ was probably supposed to be $u'=\varphi(u)$ , but in any case, it should not be needed, since $Y$ is supposed to be defined on $U'$ , which I assume is $\varphi(U)$ , so the definition of $Y$ should, I believe, read $Y(u')=(u',v_0')$ .] Extend $Y$ to $U'$ so $Y$ is zero outside $V_2$ , where $\mathrm{cl}(V_1)\subset V_2$ , $\mathrm{cl}(V_2)\subset U'$ , by means of a bump function. Define $X$ by $X_\varphi=Y$ on $U$ , and $X=0$ outside $U$ . Then $X(m)=v_0$ . The construction is similar for dual vectors. As in Theorem 4.2.16 [same number in both second and third editions], $\mathcal{F}(M)$ -linearity of $\ell$ shows that the definition of $t(m)$ is independent of how the vectors $v_0$ (and corresponding dual vectors) are extended to fields. The proof goes on from there to prove smoothness and to give a simplification in the finite-dimensional case. I have two problems with this proof: I don't see how to show that the definition of $t$ (given $\ell$ ) is independent of the choice of chart $(U,\varphi)$ . The referenced 4.2.16 only gives an example of how to prove that a particular definition is independent of the specifics of the bump function used to define it. It doesn't deal with independence from the choice of chart. I don't see how to show that $t(m)$ is continuous (multilinear). The multilinear part is easy; it's the continuous part that I can't figure out. EDIT: It occurs to me that if this proposition is going to be true, then the meaning of $L^{r+s}_{\mathcal{F}(M)}(\mathfrak{X}^*(M),\dots,\mathfrak{X}(M);\mathcal{F}(M))$ has to be more than the stated "" $\mathcal{F}(M)$ -multilinear mappings"". It seems that from the forward direction of the isomorphism we are going to have that \begin{equation*}   |\ell(\alpha^1,\dots,X_s)(m)|   =|(t(m))(\alpha^1(m),\dots,X_s(m))|   \leq||t(m)||\,||\alpha^1(m)|| \cdots ||X_s(m)|| \end{equation*} so I think this condition should be part of the definition of $L^{r+s}_{\mathcal{F}(M)}(\mathfrak{X}^*(M),\dots,\mathfrak{X}(M);\mathcal{F}(M))$ . That is, I think we should define \begin{equation*}   \begin{split}   L^{r+s}_{\mathcal{F}(M)}(&\mathfrak{X}^*(M),\dots,\mathfrak{X}(M);\mathcal{F}(M))=\\   &\{\mathcal{F}(M)\text{-multilinear }\mathcal{F}(M)\text{-valued}\,\ell:   \forall m\in M,\exists c(m)\geq 0\text{ such that}\\   &|(\ell(\alpha^1,\dots,X_s))(m)|\leq c(m)||\alpha^1(m)||\cdots||X_s(m)||\}.   \end{split} \end{equation*} Of course, we will have to specify, for each $m$ , a norm of $T_m(M)$ and for $(T_m(M))^*$ . I think this will take care of question 2. That still leaves question 1: showing chart-independence.","This question is apropos of a comment I received in the question: Lang Fundamentals of Differential Geomety definition of covariant derivative of a tensor field .

Am I on the right track or should I try a different approach? Thank you in advance! EDIT I've tried to give a proof of the result by using coordinates (I'm not too fond of it, but at least I think it gets the job done). Suppose $X(p)\neq 0$ . Then, by the Tubular Neighborhood Lemma, we can find a coordinate chart $(U,(x^{1},...,x^{n}))$ where $U$ corresponds to the cube $(-\varepsilon,\varepsilon)^{n}$ , and $X=\partial_{1}$ . To prove the result, it suffices to see that $\langle \nabla_{\partial_{i}}\partial_{1},\partial_{j} \rangle=-\langle \partial_{i},\nabla_{\partial_{j}}\partial_{1}\rangle$ . On one hand: $$ \langle \nabla_{\partial_{i}}\partial_{1},\partial_{j} \rangle_{p}=\langle \Gamma_{i1}^{k}\partial_{k},\partial_{j}\rangle_{p}=\Gamma_{i1}^{k}(p)g_{kj}(p). $$ On the other hand, since $X_{t}$ is now given in coordinates by $(u^{1},...,u^{n})\mapsto(u^{1}+t,...,u^{n})$ and is an isometry, it follows that the functions $g_{ij}$ are independent of $x^{1}$ . That is: $\partial_{1}g_{ij}=0$ . Now, by using the Koszul formula $$ \Gamma_{i 1}^{k} g_{k j}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\partial_{i} g_{1 j}+\partial_{1} g_{i j}-\partial_{j} g_{i 1}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\left(\partial_{i} g_{1 j}-\partial_{j} g_{1 i}\right)=-\Gamma_{j 1}^{k} g_{k i} $$ so we get the desired result.

Finally, if $p\notin \operatorname{Supp}(X)$ , then $X=0$ in a neighborhood of $p$ , which implies $(\nabla X)_{p}=0$ (which is clearly antisymmetric). Is this proof correct?

To do this, he produces a chart, $\phi:U_0\times V_0 \to U\times V$ on pg. 159, where $\phi(x,y)=(x,\alpha(x,y)),$ and $\alpha(x,y)$ is essentially a component of a flow of a time-dependent vector field, which on a $C^p$ manifold is only $C^{p-1}$ . Thus, a priori, $\phi$ is only $C^{p-1}$ and so could not be a chart for the $C^p$ manifold $X$ . Can one actually show $\phi$ is $C^p$ ? A similar issue arises in the ""straightening out"" proposition, 2.13 pg. 95, where the candidate chart is again obtained from a flow. Marsden, Ratiu, Abraham's Manifolds, Tensor Analysis and Applications has similar proofs of the two theorems and also do not address the degree of smoothness of the charts produced.

On pg. 159, he further reduces the problem to solving the PDE (or essentially the ""classical Frobenius theorem, as mentioned by Warner in Foundations of Diff Manifolds....) $$ D_1\alpha(x,y)=f(x,\alpha(x,y)) $$ He solves this using proposition 2.1 on pg. 160, taking $\alpha(x,y)=\beta(1,x,y)$ . Here $\beta$ is the solution of $$ D_1\beta(t,x,y) = f(tx,\beta(tx,y))\cdot x $$ He then takes a chart for manifold to be $\phi(x,y)=(x,\alpha(x,y))$ , where $\phi:U_0\times V_0\to U\times V$ .

A subset M of R^n is a smooth k dimensional manifold if it is the graph of a C1 [continuously differentiable] function f expressing n-k variables as functions of the other k variables. Here are my questions about this definition. Why force the function f to be C1? Specifically, why do we need the derivative of f to be continuous? What happens if we allow differentiable functions whose derivative is not continuous? As a follow up, a one dimensional smooth manifold is also called a smooth curve. For a (parameterised) curve to be smooth, is it really true that we require its tangent vector to be non-zero at all points? Do we lose the smoothness property even if the tangent vector at (at least) a single point is zero? Why or why not? Thanks a lot for reading my question.

Regards, Madhav","I am self studying vector calculus from Hubbard's book [I have no advanced background in topology, differential geometry and related subjects]. Here is the definition of a smooth manifold as per the text. A subset M of R^n is a smooth k dimensional manifold if it is the graph of a C1 [continuously differentiable] function f expressing n-k variables as functions of the other k variables. Here are my questions about this definition. Why force the function f to be C1? Specifically, why do we need the derivative of f to be continuous? What happens if we allow differentiable functions whose derivative is not continuous? As a follow up, a one dimensional smooth manifold is also called a smooth curve. For a (parameterised) curve to be smooth, is it really true that we require its tangent vector to be non-zero at all points? Do we lose the smoothness property even if the tangent vector at (at least) a single point is zero? Why or why not? Thanks a lot for reading my question.

60,Existence of two normal vector fields with derivatives lying in $TM$,Existence of two normal vector fields with derivatives lying in,TM,"Given a 1-codimensional manifold $M^n\hookrightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ and any local normal vector field $\nu$ it's straightforward to prove that $\partial_j\nu\in TM$ , simply by differentiating the relation $\nu\cdot\nu=1$ . In higher codimension, say $M^n\hookrightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n+2}$ , this is not always true (it's enough to consider Frenet equations for a curve in the space). I was wondering if it is always possible to construct a basis for $TM^\perp$ with this property, that is, such that $$ \partial_j\nu_k\in TM\quad\forall j=1,\dots,n \text{ and }k=1,2. $$ I made the following attempt. In a local chart for $M$ let $e_{1},\dots,e_{k}$ be a local orthonormal basis for $TM$ and $\nu_{1},\nu_{2}$ be an oriented orthonormal basis for $TM^{\perp}$ . First, notice that differentiating the relations $\nu_{k}\cdot\nu_{k}=1$ we obtain $$\partial_{i}\nu_{k}\cdot\nu_{k}=0$$ so that in general we can write $$\partial_{i}\nu_{1}=\alpha_{i}^{k}e_{k}+\beta_{i}^{1}\nu_{2}$$ $$\partial_{i}\nu_{2}	=\gamma_{i}^{k}e_{k}+\beta_{i}^{2}\nu_{1}$$ Moreover, differentiating $\nu_{1}\cdot\nu_{2}=0$ we find $$0=\partial_{i}\left(\nu_{1}\cdot\nu_{2}\right)=\partial_{i}\nu_{1}\cdot\nu_{2}+\nu_{1}\cdot\partial_{i}\nu_{2}=\beta_{i}^{1}+\beta_{i}^{2}$$ so that $\beta_{i}^{1}=-\beta_{i}^{2}=:\beta_{i}$ and we rewrite $$\partial_{i}\nu_{1}	=\alpha_{i}^{k}e_{k}+\beta_{i}\nu_{2}$$ $$\partial_{i}\nu_{2}	=\gamma_{i}^{k}e_{k}-\beta_{i}\nu_{1}.$$ In general any oriented orthonormal basis for $TM^{\perp}$ can be written as a $SO(2)$ -transformation of $\{\nu_{1},\nu_{2}\}$ , so we set $$\mu_{1}	=\cos\theta\nu_{1}-\sin\theta\nu_{2}$$ $$\mu_{2}	=\sin\theta\nu_{1}+\cos\theta\nu_{2}$$ with $\theta$ being a smooth function defined locally on $M$ . We compute \begin{align} \partial_{i}\mu_{1}	&=-\sin\theta\partial_{i}\theta\nu_{1}+\cos\theta\partial_{i}\nu_{1}-\cos\theta\partial_{i}\theta\nu_{2}-\sin\theta\partial_{i}\nu_{2} 	\\&\in TM-\left(\partial_{i}\theta-\beta_{i}\right)\sin\theta\nu_{1}-\left(\partial_{i}\theta-\beta_{i}\right)\cos\theta\nu_{2} \partial_{i}\mu_{2}	\\&=\cos\theta\partial_{i}\theta\nu_{1}+\sin\theta\partial_{i}\nu_{1}-\sin\theta\partial_{i}\theta\nu_{2}+\cos\theta\partial_{i}\nu_{2} 	\\&\in TM+\left(\partial_{i}\theta-\beta_{i}\right)\cos\theta\nu_{1}-\left(\partial_{i}\theta-\beta_{i}\right)\sin\theta\nu_{2} \end{align} So we get to the result if we find a function $\theta$ such that $d\theta=\beta$ , where $\beta=\beta_{i}dx^{i}$ . By Poincaré lemma, such $\theta$ exists if $\beta$ is a closed form, so the claim becomes $$\partial_{i}\beta_{j}=\partial_{j}\beta_{i}\quad\forall i,j=1,\dots,n.$$ Now, to prove this I used that $\beta_i=\partial_i\nu_1\cdot\nu_2$ and hence $$ \partial_j\beta_i=\partial_{ji}\nu_1\cdot\nu_2+\partial_i\nu_1\cdot\partial_j\nu_2 $$ Similarly $$ \partial_i\beta_j=\partial_{ij}\nu_1\cdot\nu_2+\partial_j\nu_1\cdot\partial_i\nu_2 $$ Taking the difference we find $$ \partial_{j}\beta_{i}-\partial_{i}\beta_{j}=\partial_i\nu_1\cdot\partial_j\nu_2-\partial_j\nu_1\cdot\partial_i\nu_2. $$ From here I'm stuck. I tried several times applying different orthogonality conditions but I can't show that the r.h.s. is $0$ . I suspect there may be some relation between $\nu_1$ and $\nu_2$ that I'm missing. I'm interested especially in the case where $M$ is a surface in $\mathbb{R}^4$ . Also, could the minimality of $M$ be of any help here?

First, notice that differentiating the relations we obtain so that in general we can write Moreover, differentiating we find so that and we rewrite In general any oriented orthonormal basis for can be written as a -transformation of , so we set with being a smooth function defined locally on . We compute So we get to the result if we find a function such that , where . By Poincaré lemma, such exists if is a closed form, so the claim becomes Now, to prove this I used that and hence Similarly Taking the difference we find From here I'm stuck. I tried several times applying different orthogonality conditions but I can't show that the r.h.s. is . I suspect there may be some relation between and that I'm missing. I'm interested especially in the case where is a surface in . Also, could the minimality of be of any help here?

I'm trying to prove $Z$ is a submanifold of $X$ . The definition I use for submanifold is: $M$ is a submanifold of $N$ if there exists a chart $(U,f)$ compatible with the smooth structure on $N$ such that $f(U\cap M) = f(U) \cap A$ where $A$ is an affine subspace of $\mathbb{R}^{\text{dim}(N)}$ . I've found a few similar posts ( [1] , [2] ). [1] uses a different definition, and [2] uses the same definition as I do, but there's no answer to the post. Here is where I got with this problem: Let $z \in Z$ . We know that $Z$ is a submanifold of $Y$ , so there exists a chart $(V,g)$ on $Y$ , compatible with the smooth structure, such that $z \in V$ and $g(V \cap Z) = g(V)\cap A_p$ , where $A_p \subseteq R^m$ is affine of dimension $p$ . Similarly, $z \in Y$ which is a submanifold of $X$ , so there exists a chart $(U, f)$ on $X$ such that $z \in U$ and $f(U\cap Y) = f(U)\cap A_m$ , where $A_m \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is affine of dimension $m$ . Now, we'd like to find a chart $(W, h)$ on $X$ such that $x \in W$ and $h(W \cap Z) = h(W) \cap A_p$ . I was thinking of this: Without loss of generality, we can assume $V \subseteq U$ . Now, the chart $g$ goes from $V$ to $\mathbb{R^m}$ . So we can compose it with a linear transformation $\tau$ so that $\tau\circ g: V \to A_m \subseteq R^n$ . Now, $(\tau \circ g)(V\cap Z) = (\tau\circ g)(V) \cap \tau(A_p)$ , where $\tau(A_p)$ also is an affine subspace of dimension $p$ , this time in $\mathbb{R}^n$ . The problem is, $V$ is a coordinate patch on $Y$ , not a patch on $X$ , so this still isn't good enough. And this is where I'm stuck. I was thinking, since $g$ has to be compatible with the standard structure of $Y$ (which is compatible with restrictions of the standard structure on $X$ ), the restriction of $f$ to $V$ has to be compatible with $g$ . In particular, there is a diffeomorphism $\phi := \left.f\right|_Y \circ g^{-1} : g(V) \to f(V\cap Y) \subseteq A_m \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ .

What I want to do is construct scalar fields on $M$ over $\mathbb C$ so that I can do derivatives(parametrized by spacetime, say, a 4 dimensional real manifold). If $f:M\to\mathbb C$ , I guess I could do $\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial w^i}=\dfrac{\partial w^j}{\partial z^i}\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial w^j}$ (given some charts) as basis transformations. The problem is that each basis $z_i$ needs two real numbers to be defined, so the tangent bundle needs to have dimension $3d$ (I think). So, for the dimension of the tangent bundle to be double the dimension of the base, either the manifold is complex(with complex coordinates, which I don't want) or the field is real(which I also don't want). I have read(wiki) that scalar fields can be complex, without much difference on which approach you take, which makes sense because, in QFT, the lagrangian(which is a function $TM\to\mathbb C$ ) is taken as if it was a real field and there is no distinction between a complex and real field, you just have a spacetime and assign a complex number to every point, that's it. I have read about almost complex structures , which is defined as a particular linear map in the tangent bundle of a smooth manifold(note it does not say anything about the manifold apart from it being smooth). Is this the structure I need? If I have an almost complex structure, what is the dimension of $TM$ (given $M$ has real dimension $d$ ), and, more importantly, what is $TM$ ? What are its basis? How does basis vectors change, is my intuition of chart transitions correct? Do the dimension of $TM$ remain as double the dimension of $M$ ?

What is the relation between $^1$ $T_x\:M$ and $T_x\:\partial M$ for $x\in\partial M$ ? I've tried to consider the case $k=d$ and $M=\mathbb H^k$ . Let $x\in\mathbb H^k$ . Then we should have $T_x\:\mathbb H^k=\mathbb R^k$ : Let $v\in\mathbb R^k\setminus\{0\}$ and $$\gamma(t):=x+tv\;\;\;\text{for }t\in\mathbb R.$$ Then, $$\forall t\in\mathbb R:\gamma(t)\in\mathbb H^k\Leftrightarrow x_k+tv_k\ge0.\tag1$$ We need to show that there is a nontrivial interval $I\subseteq\mathbb R$ with $0\in I$ such that $\left.\gamma\right|_I$ is a $C^1$ -curve on $M$ through $x$ . If $x\in(\mathbb H^k)^\circ$ , then $$B_\varepsilon(x)\subseteq\mathbb H^k\tag2$$ for some $\varepsilon>0$ and hence we may choose $$I:=\left(-\frac\varepsilon{\left\|v\right\|},\frac\varepsilon{\left\|v\right\|}\right).$$ Otherwise, $x\in\partial\mathbb H^k$ and hence $$\forall t\in\mathbb R:\gamma(t)\in\mathbb H^k\Leftrightarrow tv_k\ge0\tag3$$ and we may choose $$I:=\begin{cases}[0,\varepsilon)&\text{, if }v_k\ge0\\(-\varepsilon,0]&\text{, if }v_k\le0\end{cases}$$ for some arbitrary $\varepsilon\in(0,\infty]$ . Turning to $T_x\:\partial M$ for some $x\in\partial M$ : I guess the crucial difference between my proof of $T_x\:\mathbb H^k=\mathbb R^k$ above is that we now need to choose a curve which remains in $\partial\mathbb H^k$ .

At ""Theorem 7.8.1"" there is given a sketch of a proof which seems faulty to me. I will briefly explain the Theorem and the proof and then my problem i have. Maybe you can hint me where i missed something. We start out as usual with continuous differerentiable functions $f_0,\dots,f_m : U\to \mathbb R$ with $U\subset \mathbb R^n$ open. If the following Problem has a minimum at $\hat x$ : $\min f_0(x), x\in \mathbb R^n,\ f_1(x) = \dots = f_m(x) =0$ Then there exists $\lambda = \lambda_0,\dots,\lambda_m$ , not all $0$ with: $\mathcal L(\hat x,\lambda) = \lambda_0 f'_0(\hat x) + \dots + \lambda_m f'_m(\hat x) = 0$ The proof thats shown in the book goes like this: (you may skip this part at first glance) Let $\hat x$ be a minimal point of the Problem. Define $F(x,y) = f_0(x) \text{ if } f_1(x) +y_1 = \dots = f_m(x) + y_m = 0$ and $\infty$ otherwise. For $$\min f(x) := F(x,0)$$ we get our original Problem then. Taking the solutionset of $(z,y) = (f_0(x),\dots, f_m(x))$ we can define a function $g(x)=(z,y)$ which is continuously differnentiable and its Graph ,,can be seen'' as the Graph $\Gamma_F$ of $F$ (This is sort of wrong already but since its a sketch i get what he means). Now the author says the Tangent space $T_{(\hat x, 0_Y, f(\hat x))}$ at the $(\hat x, 0 , f(\hat x))(\Gamma_F)$ then is the Graph of the derivative $g'(\hat x)x = (f_0'(\hat x)x, \dots, f_m'(\hat x)x)$ so we can describe it by an equation $$ \langle (\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_m),y\rangle -\langle \lambda_0,z\rangle = 0 $$ And like this we get the multiplicators. Now comes the part where it seems wrong to me : We want $y$ to be $0$ to solve our problem $\min f(x) = F(x,0)$ and also $z$ to be $0$ for minimality sake which translates into $$ (\mathbb R^n \times 0_Y \times 0) + T_{(\hat x, 0_Y, f(\hat x))} \subsetneq \mathbb R^n \times Y\times \mathbb R $$ note the proper inclusion is equivalent to $(\mathbb R^n \times 0_Y \times 0)\subset T_{(\hat x, 0_Y, f(\hat x))}$ . BUT why would $z$ be $0$ ?. The Author says because Tangent space of the Graph of $f$ at the point $(\hat x, f(\hat x))$ is contained in $\mathbb R^n\times 0$ , ,,which follows immediatly from the local minimality of $f$ ''. But that thing is not even differentiable by definition. I mean okay one could go with the subgradient instead or something. But still its wrong in my opinion. I mean imagine $n=2$ and $f_0$ to be  an inverse Paraboloid and $f_1 = 0$ is our only restriction which is $0$ on the unit ball, smooth and $>0$ outside the unit ball. Then the subgradient $\partial f(x)$ will never have an element $0$ inside its subgradient . Even in this more general case its wrong right?","i am currently reading the book Convex Analysis .

So far, I know that if $M=\mathbb{R}^n$ , then each derivation can be given as a directional derivative in some direction in $\mathbb{R}^n$ . After reading the parts on the differential and its computation in coordinates, I'm still wondering why we would be interested in defining a tangent vector as a map that acts on functions on the manifold and the benefits from acting on smooth functions. The main reason that I can think of is that the collection of derivations at a point forms a vector space, which is we what want for a tangent space. I have also looked at the approach of defining tangent vectors with equivalence classes of curves, but it seems that there's also an action on $f\in C^\infty(M)$ going on; we call curves $\gamma:J\to M$ the tangent vectors, and they have a directional-derivative-like operators that act on $f\in C^\infty(M)$ by \begin{align*} \left.\frac{d}{dt}(f\circ \gamma)(t)\right|_{t=0}. \end{align*} This seems really similar to how a vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$ defines its own directional derivative, but again, I'm not sure why the action on $f\in C^\infty(M)$ would be useful/significant.","I'm revisiting the definition for tangent spaces in Lee's Introduction to Smooth Manifolds and I'm trying to convince myself why we might define tangent vectors as derivations at a point : Let be a smooth manifold, and let .

97,Curvature Flow and Green's Functions,Curvature Flow and Green's Functions,,"I'm trying to find out if there is a research area with associated literature linking the solution of Laplace's and Helmholtz's equations in 3D to curvature flow.
