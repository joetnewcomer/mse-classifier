Thus there exists a minimal element, $x_0$ in $\mathcal{X}$ Since we are assuming condition1, P($x_0$) must hold. This yields a contradiction as P($x_0$) holds, yet $x_0$ is in    $\mathcal{X}$ which is defined to be such that $\neg$ P($x$) holds for   all elements which are members. The contradiction is that P($x_0$) and $\neg$ P($x_0$) cannot both   hold. Therefore, $\mathcal{X}$ cannot be non-empty, and therefore is empty.

Here is my approach: Now I am thinking $d$ is multiplicative so we need to determine $d(2s+1)$. case 1 : If $2s+1$ is prime then $d(\psi(s))=d(s(2s+1))=d(s)*d(2s+1) = 2*2 =4$ and $4|4$. case 2 : $2s+1$ is not prime. This is where I am stuck. Now, $d(2s+1)$ is either even or odd. If it is even then $d(\psi(s))=d(s(2s+1))=d(s)*d(2s+1) = 2*2k =4k$ and $4|4k$ for some positive integer $k$. But if it's odd I am not sure of the next move. If it is odd and squarefree then $2s+1$ has an even number of divisors? Is this the right approach or is there a better way to go about this? Also is the statement even true, is there a quick counter example? I want to go a step further and claim that $d(\psi(s))$ is equal to $4, 8, 12, 16, 20$ or $24$",,"['combinatorics', 'number-theory', 'elementary-set-theory', 'prime-numbers', 'divisor-counting-function']"

Any sentences in brackets [] will be omitted in the formal proof. Problem Let $B$ be a set, let $A_1, \dotsc, A_n$ be sets for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $h_i : B \rightarrow A_i$ be a function for each $i \in \{1,\dotsc,n\}$. Prove that there is a unique function $g:B\rightarrow A_1 \times \cdots \times A_n$ such that $\pi_i \circ g = h_i$ for all $i \in \{1,\dotsc, n\}$ where $\pi_i:A_1 \times \cdots A_n \rightarrow A_i$ is the projection map. Proof Existence Set $I$ to be an indexing set such that $I = \{1,\dotsc,n\}$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Let $h_i:B \rightarrow A_i$ for each $i \in I$. Let $b \in B$. Iterating through the values of $i$, we have a sequence of images $h_1(b), \dotsc, h_n(b)$. If the set $A_1 \times \dotsc \times A_n$ is a Cartesian product for each $A_i$, then the $n$-list $(h_1(b), \dotsc, h_n(b)) \in A_1 \times \dotsc \times A_n$. Thus, we have an ordered pair $(b,(h_1(b), \dotsc, h_n(b)))$. Define the relation $g:B \rightarrow A_1 \times \dotsc \times A_n$. Then $(b,(h_1(b), \dotsc, h_n(b))) \in g$. To prove that $g$ is a function, we first note that for every $b \in B$, the function $h_i$ gaurantees the (unique) existence of an image $(h_1(b),\dotsc,h_n(b)) \in A_1 \times \dotsc \times A_n$. To prove uniqueness, let the images $x = g(b)$ and $y = g(b)$ for each $b \in B$ such that $x \neq y$. Thus, the n-lists $x = (h_1(b),\dots, h_n(b))$ and $y = (h_1(b),\dotsc, h_n(b))$ have at least one differing component $j$ where we denote $h_j(b)$ to be the $j^{th}$-component of $x$, and $h^*_j(b)$ to be the $j^{th}$ componenet of $y$. Therefore, $h_j(b) \neq h^*_j(b)$. But this implies that $h_j$ is not a function for an arbitrary $j \in I$, which is a contradiction. Hence, $g$ is a function. Now construct the composition $\pi_i \circ g: B \rightarrow A_i$. We will prove that $\pi_i \circ g = h_i$. We first note that the domain and codomain of $\pi_i \circ g$ and $h_i$ are equal by construction. We now prove that for all $b \in B$, we have $h_i(b) = \pi_i(g(b))$ for all $i \in I$ Choose any $m \in I$. First, let $b \in B$. Then $h_m \in A_m$. By definition of $\pi_i \circ g$, the fact that $h_m \in A_m$ for an arbitrary $m \in I$ implies that $(b,h_m(b)) \in \pi_i \circ g$, so $h_i \subseteq \pi_i \circ g$. Now, since we are assuming that $b \in B$, we have $g(b) \in A_1 \times \dotsc \times A_n$. Then applying $\pi_m$ to $g$, we deduce that $\pi(g(b)) \in A_m$. By definition of $h$, we must have $(b, \pi_m(g(b))) \in h_m$. Therefore, $\pi_i \circ g \subseteq h_i$. We conclude that $\pi_i \circ g = h_i$ for each $i \in I$. Uniqueness Suppose to the contrary that there are two functions $g:B\rightarrow A_1 \times \dotsc \times A_n$ and $g':B\rightarrow A_1 \times \dotsc \times A_n$ such that $h_i = \pi_i \circ g$, $h_i = \pi_i \circ g'$ for all $i \in I$, and $g(b) \neq g'(b)$ for some $b\in B$ [This implies that some of the components of $g(b)$ and $g'(b)$ are not equal; recall that $g(b) \in A_1 \times \dotsc \times A_n$, which means that the element $g(b) = (a_1,\dotsc,a_n)$ for some $a_i \in A_i$] Let $b \in B$. For each $m \in I$, we have $h_m(b) \in A_m$. From our premise, we know that $h_m = \pi_m(g(b))$ and $h_m = \pi_m(g'(b))$. We note that we cannot have $\pi_m(g(b)) \neq \pi_m(g(b))$, because then $h_m$ would not be a function. Hence, $\pi_m(g(b)) = \pi_m(g'(b))$. However, observe that $\pi_m(g(b))$ is an arbitrary component of the preimage $g(b)$. Thus the equality $\pi_m(g(b)) = \pi_m(g'(b))$ implies that the components of $g(b)$ and $g'(b)$ are equal, entailing that $g(b) = g'(b)$. Hence the function $g = g'$. Therefore, there exists a unique function $g: B \rightarrow A_1 \times \dotsc \times A_n$ such that $\pi_i \circ g = h_i$ for all $i \in I$. $\blacksquare$","I was wondering if someone would not mind proofreading my demonstration for the following problem.
