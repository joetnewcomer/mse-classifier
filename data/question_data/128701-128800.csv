1,No group of order $400$ is simple - clarification,No group of order  is simple - clarification,400,"I was reading through a proof that no group of order $400$ is simple which can be found here: https://math.stackexchange.com/a/79644/169389 Here is an outline for a solution. First of all, $|G| = 400 = 2^4 \cdot 5^2\ $ . By Sylow's theorem we know that the number of Sylow 5-subgroups must be a divisor of $2^4$ and that it is $1$ modulo $5$ . Thus it is either $1$ or $2^4$ . If there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, it must be normal. For the other case, suppose first that the intersections of different Sylow 5-subgroups are always trivial. By counting elements you can conclude that $G$ has exactly one Sylow 2-subgroup, which is then normal. If we have Sylow 5-subgroups $P$ and $Q$ such that $P \cap Q \neq \{1\}$ , then $|P \cap Q| = 5$ . Therefore $P \cap Q$ is normal in $P$ and $Q$ , and thus is normal in the subgroup $\langle P, Q \rangle$ generated by $P$ and $Q$ . Finally, show that either $\langle P, Q \rangle$ is normal in $G$ or equals $G$ . I am trying to get to grips with general problems like this and feel that this is one of the best explanations, but I still feel that this argument goes too quickly and I still need some clarification on a few things. First problem : In the second paragraph we consider $n_5$ (number of sylow 5-subgroups) $=2^4$ and suppose that the intersections of different Sylow $5$ -subgroups $=1$ . When he says ""by counting the elements"", I guess he means the intersections of different Sylow $5$ -subgroups which would be $1$ which we have assumed, how can we now conclude that $n_2=1$ ? Second problem : I am wondering why $|P \cap Q| = 5$ and not $5$ or $25$ , I think that it may be because they are different their intersection would have to be $5$ since if the intersection is only of order $25$ when the groups are the same and of order $25$ , but if this could be clarified, it would be greatly appreciated Third problem : To show $\langle P, Q \rangle$ is normal in $G$ or equals $G$ .

Let $S^1$ denote the set of $(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2$ with $x^2 + y^2 = 1$ . (This could be complex, I believe, and we'd arrive at the same conclusion. That could be the missing link my understanding.) The symmetry group of $S^1$ consists of rotations and reflections, which is infinite. I cannot fully visualize this, but my mental picture is that it takes a point $(x,y)$ on the circle and either moves it counterclockwise along the unit circle (in polar coordinates, the value of $\theta$ increases mod $2\pi$ ) or reflects it in any line through the origin. The author claims that the rotation of $S^1$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ . I'm not certain I fully understand this. I believe the complex unit circle is isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ with isomorphism given by (denoting the complex unit circle by $C^1$ ) $$ f: \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z} \to C^1, \; t \mapsto \exp(2\pi t i). $$ Here I am thinking of $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ as the set $[0,1)$ , so varying $t$ amounts to varying the polar angle in the complex plane. Since $\mathbb{C} \cong \mathbb{R}^2$ as a vector space, it seems to me that this conclusion should be unchanged. But then $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ is isomorphic to both the unit circle in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and the group of rotations of the unit circle, so the unit circle is isomorphic to its rotation group.

98,Prove that $xax^{-1} = yay^{-1}$ iff $C_a x = C_a y$.,Prove that  iff .,xax^{-1} = yay^{-1} C_a x = C_a y,"I'm trying to prove an exercise in a book on abstract algebra I am reading. The setup is that for any element $a$ of a group $G$ , we define the centraliser $C_a = \{ x \in G : xa = ax \}$ , so all elements that commute with $a$ . Now, we must prove that if $xax^{-1} = yay^{-1}$ , that $C_a x = C_a y$ . My progress is that $xax^{-1} = yay^{-1}$ implies that $(y^{-1}x)a = a(y^{-1}x)$ , so $y^{-1}x \in C_a$ . However, this proves that $C_a y^{-1} = C_a x^{-1}$ , which I do not think is equivalent to $C_a x = C_a y$ (as $C_a x = C_a x^{-1}$ is not generally true). Am I missing something obvious here?","I'm trying to prove an exercise in a book on abstract algebra I am reading.

99,Commutator of two elements in group algebra $\mathbb F_{5}D_{30}.$,Commutator of two elements in group algebra,\mathbb F_{5}D_{30}.,"I want to understand how to find the commutator of two elements in the group algebra $\mathbb{F}_{5}D_{30}$ using GAP. Additionally, I would like to determine the nilpotency class of the nilpotent group $1+J(\mathbb{F}_{5}D_{30})$ which is a subgroup of unit group, where $J(\mathbb{F}_{5}D_{30})$ represents the Jacobson radical of the group algebra $\mathbb{F}_{5}D_{30}$ . In this context, $D_{30}=\{{a,b\mid a^{15}=b^2=1, bab=a^{-1}}\}$ denotes the dihedral group of order $30.$ Here, $\mathbb{F}_{5}$ is a field of characteristic $5$ , consisting of $5$ elements. It is already known that $({1+J(\mathbb{F}_{5}D_{30})})^5=1$ since $(J(\mathbb{F}_{5}D_{30}))^5=0$ . The nilpotency class of $1+J(\mathbb{F}_{5}D_{30})$ has been determined to be $4$ through calculations, but I would like to verify this using GAP. How to demonstrate the nilpotency class of the nilpotent group $1+J(\mathbb{F}_{5}D_{30})$ as $4$ , and to compute the commutator $(x,y)=x^{-1}y^{-1}xy$ where $x=a^3$ and $y=1+4b+a^9b$ ?
