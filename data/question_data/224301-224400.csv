I wonder if we can use this formula to derrive properties of the tangent bundle and the vector fields on $X$? I first wanted to use that the top Chern class is the Euler-class, i.e. the first Chern number of the tangent bundle is the Euler characteristics.

Edit: I made some progress on this questionm however I am not sure about the meaning of the results. Maybe someone can provide some background information. As the holomorphic tangent bundle $\mathcal{T}_X$ is the dual of the canonical bundle $\Omega_X$, it follows that $c_1(\mathcal T_X)=-c_1(\Omega_X) = 2-2g=\chi(X)$. Thus we get $c_1(\mathcal T_X)=c_1(TX) = c_1(T^{1,0}X \oplus T^{0,1}X) = c_1(T^{1,0}X)+c_1(T^{0,1}X)$, so $c_1(T^{0,1}X)=0$. What does this mean (maybe in regards to curvature)?

If additionally the fraction field of $R$ does not contain the algebraic closure of its prime field (i.e. $\mathbb{Q}$ if the characteristic is $0$ or $\mathbb{F}_p$ if the characteristic is $p > 0$) then one can use the existence of an anisotropic form in two variables over this field to show that an intersection of diophantine sets is again diophantine. Hence in this case, all positive-existential sets are diophantine. For a counterexample for the implication positive-existential $\Rightarrow$ diophantine in general, it suffices to note that, for a ring $R$, the diophantine subsets of the product ring $R \times R$ are precisely those of the form $A \times A$ for some diophantine subset $A$ of $R$. This makes it easy to construct positive-existential subsets which are not diophantine by taking the union of two such sets. For example, let $R$ be a field, set $$ A = \lbrace x \in R \mid \exists y \in R : x \cdot y = 1 \rbrace = R\setminus \lbrace 0 \rbrace , $$ then $A \times A \cup \lbrace (0,0) \rbrace$ is positive-existential but not diophantine. Question : can we find a domain $R$ in which not all positive-existential subsets are already diophantine, i.e. there exists two diophantine subsets of which the intersection is not diophantine? Could $R$ even be a field? I have been trying with $\mathbb{C}[T]$ and $\mathbb{C}(T)$ but have had no luck.",,"['algebraic-geometry', 'logic', 'first-order-logic', 'affine-varieties']"

Whenever we have a map between affine (or projective) spaces given by componentwise polynomial (or monomial, of the same degree) maps, the image of the morphism will be contained and Zariski dense in the kernel of the corresponding $k$-algebra homomorphism. However, it need not be true that the image of the morphism is itself a variety in these circumstances (e.g. $(a,b) \mapsto (a, ab)$). Are there sufficient conditions to guarantee that the image corresponds precisely with the kernel of the $k$-algebra homomorphism that apply to the situation in (1)? Are there any sufficient conditions of a general morphism of varieties guaranteeing the image will be a variety that apply to the situation in (1)?",,['algebraic-geometry']

Let $X=\text{Spec}(A)$ be an affine scheme $f\in A, D(f)\subseteq X$ . Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a quasi coherent sheaf on $X$ . If $s\in \Gamma(X,\mathcal{F})$ is such that $s|_{D(f)}=0$ then for some $n>0$ , $f^ns=0$ . If $t\in \Gamma(D(f),\mathcal{F})$ then for some $n>0$ $f^nt$ extends to a global section of $\mathcal{F}$ over $X$ . I tried to see what this means in case of simple quasicoherent sheaves. For $X=\text{Spec}(A)$ , structure sheaf $\mathcal{O}_X$ is a quasicoherent sheaf of $\mathcal{O}_X$ modules.  In this case, $\mathcal{F}(X)\rightarrow \mathcal{F}(D(f))$ is $\mathcal{O}_X(X)\rightarrow \mathcal{O}_X(D(f))$ i.e., $A\rightarrow A_f$ . So, $s|_{D(f)}=0$ means that $\frac{s}{1}=0\in A_f$ i.e., $f^ns=0$ for some $n\in \mathbb{N}$ .

Let $t\in \Gamma(D(f),\mathcal{F})=A_f$ so, $t=a/f^n$ for some $n\in \mathbb{N}$ i.e., $f^nt=a\in A_f$ . So, $a\in \Gamma(X,\mathcal{F})$ is such that its restiction to $\Gamma(D(f),\mathcal{F})$ is $a/1=f^nt$ . For $X=\text{Spec}(A)$ and for an $A$ module $M$ , $\widetilde{M}$ is a quasicoherent sheaf of $\mathcal{O}_X$ modules.

To prove that $f^ns=0$ , the strategy is to prove that $f^ns|_{D(g_i)}=0$ for all $1\leq i\leq r$ . Then by gluing we see that $f^ns=0$ . Let $s_i=s|_{D(g_i)}$ . We have $\mathcal{F}(D(g_i))\rightarrow \mathcal{F}(D(f)\cap D(g_i))=\mathcal{F}(D(fg_i))$ . As $\mathcal{F}|_{D(g_i)}=\widetilde{M_i}$ we have $\widetilde{M_i}(D(g_i))\rightarrow \widetilde{M_i}(D(fg_i))$ i.e., $M_i\rightarrow (M_i)_{fg_i}$ and $s_i\mapsto \frac{s_i}{1}=0\in (M_i)_{fg_i}$ i.e., $g_i^{n_i}f^{n_i}s_i=0$ .

Since $i^{\#}: \mathcal O_X \rightarrow i_{\ast} \mathcal O_Z$ is a surjective morphism of sheaves of rings, the kernel $\mathscr I$  of $i^{\#}$ induces an isomorphism of sheaves of rings $\mathcal O_X/\mathscr I \cong i_{\ast} \mathcal O_Z$.  Since we are dealing with a sheaf of rings $\mathcal O_Z$ on a closed subset, we recover $\mathcal O_Z$ by taking the inverse image sheaf: $$\mathcal O_Z \cong i^{-1} (\mathcal O_X/\mathscr I)$$ Now, let $F$ be a sheaf of $\mathcal O_X$-modules.  Suppose that for each open $U$, $\mathscr I(U)$ annihilates $F(U)$.  Then $F$ is well defined as a sheaf of $\mathcal O_X/\mathscr I$-modules. This implies $i^{-1}F$ is a sheaf of $\mathcal O_Z = i^{-1}(\mathcal O_X/\mathscr I)$-modules. Suppose furthermore that for each $x \in X - Z$, the stalk $F_x = 0$.  Then $F$ can be recovered as $i_{\ast} i^{-1}F$. In this case, does it make sense to say that $F$ is a sheaf of $\mathcal O_Z$-modules ?

Even though I know it's certainly not zero, there are two reasons why I convinced myself it was; one of them probably very basic, the other to do with Atiyah-Bott localization. Before getting there, let $X$ be a compact, complex manifold with formal Chern roots $x_{i}$.  The Hirzebruch $\chi_{y}$ genus is given by $$\chi_{y}(X) = \int_{X} \prod_{i} (1+ye^{-x_{i}}) \frac{x_{i}}{1-e^{-x_{i}}}$$ Now, for a one-dimensional torus, there is only one factor in that product.  Moreover, its Chern root is zero since the tangent bundle is trivial.  However, one cannot naively set $x=0$, since you end up with a indeterminate $0/0$ expression.  Rather, I expanded the integrand: $$(1+ye^{-x})\frac{x}{1-e^{-x}}=(y+1) + \frac{1}{2} x (y-1) + \cdots$$ Since the integral is a pairing of homology and cohomology classes, we only get contributions from one of those terms leaving, $$\chi_{y}(X) = \frac{1}{2}(y-1)\int_{X} x $$ If that integral were one , I think that would be the right answer, but why isn't that integral zero!?  That Chern root should be zero, and moreover, the integral of the top Chern class is the Euler characteristic which is zero.  Where exactly am I overlooking something here? Localization Argument: The other reason I convinced myself this should vanish, is that a torus acts freely on itself.  So I thought that by the Atiyah-Bott localization, if there are no fixed points, then the integral simply vanishes.

93,Morphism of curve associated to an extension of fields of dim $1$,Morphism of curve associated to an extension of fields of dim,1,"This is a basic question in algebraic geometry which probably is already answered somewhere in the web, but I am struggling too much on it and I couldn't find anything which could be of help.I thought that it is maybe worth to ask you if you can give me the right idea. I use a step inside the proof of Corollary II.6.10 of Hartshorne, Algebraic Geometry, as an example of the idea I am struggling to get. In the following $X$ is a curve (in the sense of Hartshorne, i.e. integral separated (complete nonsingular) scheme of finite type and dimension $1$ over a field $k$) and $K(X)$ is the field of rational functions on it. Given $f\in K(X)^*$ such that $f\notin k$, consider the extension $k(f)\subset K(X)$ of field. Claim : this extension of fields induces a morphisms $X\to\mathbb{P}^1$ of curves. What I thought: I know (Hartshorne, Corollary I.6.12) that there is an equivalence of categories between the category of nonsingular projective curves with dominant morphisms and the category of function fields of dimension $1$ over $k$ with $k$-homomorphisms. Moreover this equivalence reverse the arrows (Theorem I.4.4). The equivalence is described in terms of abstract nonsingular curves as defined by Hartshorne in Section I.6. In particular, to every function field $K$ of dimension $1$ we can associate a nonsingular projective curve $C_K$ (Theorem I.6.9). Coming back to the claim, I should get a morphism of curves $$X\to C_{k(f)}.$$ Now, why is $C_{k(f)}\cong\mathbb{P}^1$? I've tried to work out something explicitly, but it turns out that this situation is too generic. Moreover, later on inside the book (exercise IV.2.2.(b)), he seems to claim the same using the extension $k(x)\subset k(x,\beta)$ (here $\beta$ is the solution in $k(x,y)$ of a polynomial in $k(x)[y]$). I mean that he defines the morphism $X=C_{k(x,\beta)}\to\mathbb{P}^1$, from whom I deduce (maybe erroneously) that $C_{k(x)}\cong\mathbb{P}^1$ as well. I think I am lacking something theoretic here. Disclaimer: from a complex geometric point of view, I know that a meromorphic function $f$ on a curve $X$ gives a morphism $X\to\mathbb{P}^1$ sending $x$ to $f(x)$ and this is exactly what I expect the map in the claim does. This is also quite convincing that the answer to the question is affirmative for every $f\in K(X)$ (even if there still is a discrepancy between that function field and $K(\mathbb{P}^1)$). But what about $k(x)$? I have no evidence for it. Thank you very much for any kind of hint/suggestion/advice/answer you can give me and I hope I am not completely misunderstanding everything!","This is a basic question in algebraic geometry which probably is already answered somewhere in the web, but I am struggling too much on it and I couldn't find anything which could be of help.I thought that it is maybe worth to ask you if you can give me the right idea. I use a step inside the proof of Corollary II.6.10 of Hartshorne, Algebraic Geometry, as an example of the idea I am struggling to get. In the following $X$ is a curve (in the sense of Hartshorne, i.e. integral separated (complete nonsingular) scheme of finite type and dimension $1$ over a field $k$) and $K(X)$ is the field of rational functions on it. Given $f\in K(X)^*$ such that $f\notin k$, consider the extension $k(f)\subset K(X)$ of field. Claim : this extension of fields induces a morphisms $X\to\mathbb{P}^1$ of curves. What I thought: I know (Hartshorne, Corollary I.6.12) that there is an equivalence of categories between the category of nonsingular projective curves with dominant morphisms and the category of function fields of dimension $1$ over $k$ with $k$-homomorphisms. Moreover this equivalence reverse the arrows (Theorem I.4.4). The equivalence is described in terms of abstract nonsingular curves as defined by Hartshorne in Section I.6. In particular, to every function field $K$ of dimension $1$ we can associate a nonsingular projective curve $C_K$ (Theorem I.6.9). Coming back to the claim, I should get a morphism of curves $$X\to C_{k(f)}.$$ Now, why is $C_{k(f)}\cong\mathbb{P}^1$? I've tried to work out something explicitly, but it turns out that this situation is too generic. Moreover, later on inside the book (exercise IV.2.2.(b)), he seems to claim the same using the extension $k(x)\subset k(x,\beta)$ (here $\beta$ is the solution in $k(x,y)$ of a polynomial in $k(x)[y]$).

94,Why are stalks of sheaves defined as colimits?,Why are stalks of sheaves defined as colimits?,,"Let $\mathcal F$ be a sheaf on a topological space $X$, i.e. a functor $\mathcal F: \mathbf{Ouv}(X)\to R$ with some algebraic category $R$, for example rings. The functor $\mathcal F$ assigns an algebraic structure to each open set of $X$. For any point $x$ we get a set of neighbourhoods $\{U_i\}$ ($x\in U_i$ for all $i\in I$), which forms a directed system by inclusion: we have a ""direction"" $U_i \to U_j$ iff $U_i\subset U_j$. As I understand it, the concept of a stalk $\mathcal F_x$ of $x\in X$ tries to capture the sheaf's local behavior around a point $x\in X$. To realize this, I would expect to have inclusions $\mathcal F_x\subset U_i$ for each $i\in I$. The stalk $\mathcal F_x$ should be something very small around $x$. Now, the stalk $\mathcal F_x$ of $x$ is defined as the direct limit of the directed system $\{U_i\}$, which is the colimit of the directed system as a functor.

96,Generalizing pullback of cycles and intersection products as suggested in Serre's local algebra,Generalizing pullback of cycles and intersection products as suggested in Serre's local algebra,,"Chapter V in the book Local algebra by Serre, introduces the notion of a ""relative intersection product"" meaning that if $f: X \to Y$ is a morphism of varieties with $Y$ regular and $x,y$ are cycles on $X$ and $Y$ respectively then we can define a cycle on $X$ denoted $x \cdot_f y$ and this product is stated in terms of a formula involving $Tor$ functors. In the case where $x = X$ one then denotes the aforementioned product by $f^{*}y$ which is then defined to be the pullback of the cycle $y$ to $X$. Since this is a book on commutative algebra, it is perhaps not very surprising that this last section concerning applications to algebraic geometry is very sketched and lacking in several ways. By this I mean that for instance some properties of the pullback are mentioned, a projection formula being one of them, but the reader is only given a vague idea of how spectral sequences can be applied to prove this. Another point I would like to make is that only varieties over algebraically closed fields are considered, but there doesn't seem to be any reason why this should not work more generally. The book is concluded by mentioning that the Tor formula can be used to extend intersection theory, regular schemes being one class of objects this should work for, so I suppose that it should be possible to develop the ideas introduced in chapter V in more generality. However from what I understand even the Stacks-project does this in the same settings as Serre. My question: Is there any reference that introduces the ""$Tor$""-formula and uses it to define the pullback of a cycle $y$ by any morphism of schemes $f: X \to Y$ with $Y$ regular (and possibly $X$,$Y$ integral and of finite type over a field $k$ which is not necessarily algebraically closed) and also proves the projection formula $f_{*}(x \cdot_f y) = f_{*}(X) \cdot y$ when $f$ is proper and both sides are defined? I would like to add that Suslin and Voevodsky use this aforementioned machinery in their article ""Singular homology of abstract algebraic varieties"" in the case where $f: X \to S$ is a finite surjective morphism of integral ($k$)-schemes with $Y$ regular, so it should at least hold in that case.
