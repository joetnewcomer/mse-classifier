1,Prove that there is no positive integer between 0 and 1,Prove that there is no positive integer between 0 and 1,,"In my textbook ""Elementary Number Theory with Applications"" by Thomas Koshy on pg. 16, there is an example given just after the well ordering principle: Prove that there is no positive integer between $0$ and $1$ . My question is how can you even start this proof? I checked the book and google for a formal definition of integers, but they are pretty vague. The book just says $\{\ldots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots\}$ , and some of the websites say that it's a number without a fractional component. Then what is a fractional component? I took a course on Algebra and we defined them as equivalence classes... but to obtain that, it would require the knowledge of basic things like $1$ is the least positive integer. So I'm getting stuck in this loop. Here's what the textbook says. Proof. (as in textbook) Suppose there is a positive integer a between $0$ and $1$ . Let $S = \{n \in \mathbb{Z}^+ | 0 < n < 1\}$ . Since $0 < a < 1$ , $a \in S$ , so $S$ is nonempty. Therefore, by the well-ordering principle, $S$ has a least element $l$ , where $0 < l < 1$ . Then $0 < l^2 < l$ , so $l^2 \in S$ . But $l^2$ < $l$ , which contradicts our assumption that $l$ is a least element of $S$ . Thus, there are no positive integers between $0$ and $1$ . However, we have no definition of $l^2$ (and we can't say anything about its order). I'm just simply not getting convinced by this proof. Can someone help?","In my textbook ""Elementary Number Theory with Applications"" by Thomas Koshy on pg. 16, there is an example given just after the well ordering principle: Prove that there is no positive integer between and .

Knuth also proposes to study the more general class of functions such that $$f(x)+f\left(x+\frac{1}{n}\right)+\cdots +f\left(x+\frac{n-1}{n}\right)=a_nf(nx)+b_n,$$ where $a_n$ and $b_n$ depend on $n$ but not $x$. Is anyone aware of more information regarding this topic? Any help is greatly appreciated.",,"['number-theory', 'special-functions']"

11,primes represented integrally by a homogeneous cubic form,primes represented integrally by a homogeneous cubic form,,"Expired by this question Show determinant of matrix is non-zero I am moved to ask: Given integers $a,b,c,$ and cubic form $$ f(a,b,c) = a^3+2 b^3-6 a b c+4 c^3 = \left|\begin{bmatrix} a & 2c & 2b\\b & a & 2c\\ c & b & a\end{bmatrix}\right|,  $$  what primes $p$ can be

With this ""result"" applied to only the first six odd primes $3,5,7,11,13,17$ (I have verified the conjecture is true for these), it appears we already can say that for about $96.4 \%$ of the natural numbers, $S_n$ is not a perfect square. You could probably show this rigorously via the Chinese Remainder Theorem, but whatever. (And of course, I imagine the more primes you use, the better the results, but at some point too many modulus operations becomes a burden.)",,"['number-theory', 'diophantine-equations', 'square-numbers']"

We get the following sequence, where the $i$th term is the value of $M_p$ for the $i$th largest prime $p$ of the form $p\equiv 1\pmod 3$, and I have computed here for all $p\leq 1000$: $12, 12, 12, 36, 48, 36, 48, 84, 84, 84, 84, 84, 108, 108, 156, 156, 144, 156, 156, 192, 228, 228, 252, 252, 228, 300, 252, 252, 324, 336, 300, 372, 336, 372, 336, 372, 432, 372, 444, 432, 468, 468, 444, 444, 468, 516, 588, 588, 588, 624, 576, 588, 624, 588, 588, 684, 624, 624, 684, 732, 684, 684, 756, 804, 732, 768, 732, 756, 876, 876, 912, 804, 912, 876, 948, 972, 912, 948, 948, 1008, \dots$ It seems that however many terms you take their GCD is always $12$, and this doesn't change as far as $p\leq 3000$, so I have two questions: Can anyone prove that $M_p$ is always divisible by 12? Since 1992 when the book was published, has anyone found an expression for $M_p$?

However, the family of good pairs that I've found is not all of them, and the argument is not as elementary as I'd like. Observation: we can check small values to show that good pairs do indeed exist, e.g. $(1,2),\, (4,7),\,(5,12),\, (11,16)$ . To construct an infinite family of good pairs, suppose we have $$\frac{a^2+b^2+1}{a+b}=k\in\mathbb{N},$$ then $a^2+b^2+1 - k(a+b)=0$ , and completing the square for $a$ and $b$ gives the equation for a circle: $$\left(a-\frac{k}{2}\right)^2+\left(b-\frac{k}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{k^2}{2}-1$$ $$\implies a = \frac{k}{2} + \sqrt{\frac{k^2}{2}-1-\left(b-\frac{k}{2}\right)^2}.$$ Let $k=2j$ for some $j\in\mathbb{N}$ to eliminate the fractions, obtaining $a=j+\sqrt{j^2-1-b^2+2jb}$ . In order to have $a\in\mathbb{N}$ , we must have $j^2-1-b^2+2bj=n^2$ for some $n\in\mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$ . We can view this as a quadratic in $b$ : $$b^2-2jb+(n^2+1-j^2)=0.$$ Since we require $b\in\mathbb{N}$ , the discriminant $\Delta$ must be of the form $\Delta = 4m^2$ for some $m\in\mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$ . Thus we have the following expressions for $a$ and $b$ : $$b=\dfrac{2j\pm\sqrt{\Delta}}{2} = j+m, \qquad a = j + \sqrt{n^2} = j+n.$$ Considering the discriminant: $$\Delta = (-2j)^2 - 4(n^2+1-j^2) = 4m^2$$ $$\implies 2j^2-1 = m^2+n^2.$$ If $a<b$ we must have $n<m$ . In particular, we can assume $n=0$ without restricting $m$ . Then we have $m^2-2j^2=-1$ , and so we have a correspondence between certain good pairs $(a,b)$ and elements of norm $-1$ in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$ . For $x+y\sqrt{2}\in\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$ , define $N(x+y\sqrt{2})=x^2-2y^2$ , and observe that this function is multiplicative. We have $N(1\pm\sqrt{2})=-1$ , and thus $N((1\pm\sqrt{2})^{2r-1})=(-1)^{2r-1}=-1$ for any $r\in\mathbb{N}$ . Let $m+j\sqrt{2} = (1+\sqrt{2})^{2r-1}$ and so $m-j\sqrt{2} = (1-\sqrt{2})^{2r-1}$ . We can combine these expressions to obtain the following general formulas for values of $m$ and $j$ : $$m_r = \frac{(1+\sqrt{2})^{2r-1}+(1-\sqrt{2})^{2r-1}}{2},\qquad j_r = \frac{(1+\sqrt{2})^{2r-1}-(1-\sqrt{2})^{2r-1}}{2\sqrt{2}}.$$ Then we have $a=j+n=j$ and $b=m+j$ , thus we have an infinite family of good pairs $(a_r,b_r)$ for $r\in\mathbb{N}$ given by: $$a_r = \frac{(1+\sqrt{2})^{2r-1}-(1-\sqrt{2})^{2r-1}}{2\sqrt{2}},\qquad b_r = \frac{(1+\sqrt{2})^{2r}-(1-\sqrt{2})^{2r}}{2\sqrt{2}}.$$ The first few values of $r$ gives the good pairs $(1,2),\,(5,12),\,(29,70),\,(169,408),(985,2378)$ with corresponding values of $k=2,10,58,338, 1970$ . I seek advice both on this proof itself (i.e. does it work?) and also in seeking a more elementary argument (i.e. without requiring knowledge about $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$ and the like) - it doesn't necessarily need to be constructive, in fact it would be interesting to know if there exists a more concise argument to that effect. Regarding finding good pairs themselves, comparing the list constructed in my solution to thta of the observation, it's clear that this solution 'misses' some pairs - and this comes a no surprise since we disregard the cases that $k$ is odd, and $n>0$ . If $k=2j-1$ , then we can use a similar method to show $j^2-j-b^2+2jb-b=n^2-n$ for some $n\in\mathbb{N}$ , but I haven't been able to make any progress from this. The case for $k$ even and $n>0$ is essentially asking ""when can $2j^2+1$ be written as the sum of two squares"", which I'm not sure quite how to answer - using known results about sums of two square seems difficult as $2j^2+1$ has no general factorisation.

By the way, I've known the following expression: $$\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}x\log \left(\sin x\right)dx=\frac{\pi^2}{8}\left(\log {\frac{\pi}{2}}-\frac12-\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{\zeta (2n)}{n(n+1)2^{2n}}\right).$$ I got interested in this infinite series, and I've just known the following similar formula without any proof: $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{\zeta (2n)}{2n(2n+1)2^{2n}}=\frac12\left(\log \pi-1\right).$$ Then, my question is how to prove this formula. I suspect that the following expression might be used:$$\sin {\pi x}=\pi x\prod_{n=1}^\infty\left(1-\frac{x^2}{n^2}\right).$$ Though I've tried to prove this, I'm facing difficulty.

96,"What is the intuitive meaning of ""conspiracy"" in number theory?","What is the intuitive meaning of ""conspiracy"" in number theory?",,"Assuming very little number-theoretic background from my part, could you please explain me what is the intuitive meaning behind ""conspiracy"" in number theory? There is no formal entry on Wikipedia and I found the term in Terence Tao's blog and if my memory is correct I believe he touched upon it in a YouTube video. More specifically, I am having trouble understanding the following excerpt from the same blog: Philosophically, one of the main reasons why it is so hard to control   the distribution of the primes is that we do not currently have too   many tools with which one can rule out “conspiracies” between the   primes, in which the primes (or the von Mangoldt function) decide to   correlate with some structured object (and in particular, with a   totally multiplicative function) which then visibly distorts the   distribution of the primes. For instance, one could imagine a scenario   in which the probability that a randomly chosen large integer ${n}$ is   prime is not asymptotic to ${\frac{1}{\log n}}$ (as is given by the   prime number theorem), but instead to fluctuate depending on the phase   of the complex number ${n^{it}}$ for some fixed real number ${t}$, thus   for instance the probability might be significantly less than ${1/\log > n}$ when ${t \log n}$ is close to an integer, and significantly more than   ${1/\log n}$ when ${t \log n}$ is close to a half-integer. This would   contradict the prime number theorem, and so this scenario would have   to be somehow eradicated in the course of proving that theorem. In the   language of Dirichlet series, this conspiracy is more commonly known   as a zero of the Riemann zeta function at ${1+it}$. Please note that my motivation is chiefly a philosophical interpretation than a number theoretic one, so it would be very helpful if the reasoning is directed in that way. Thank you.","Assuming very little number-theoretic background from my part, could you please explain me what is the intuitive meaning behind ""conspiracy"" in number theory?
