67,Why Fibonacci-Jacobsthal sequences divert into positive and negative values in the complex plane?,Why Fibonacci-Jacobsthal sequences divert into positive and negative values in the complex plane?,,"The Fibonacci numbers closed-form expression is as follows: $$F_n = \frac{\varphi^n-(1-\varphi)^n}{\sqrt{5}}$$ where $\varphi = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$ is the golden ratio . I wanted to review what happens when instead of $\sqrt{5}$ another root is used, in a kind of generalization of the Fibonacci numbers , so I have defined the following generic expression ($E1$): $$F_n = \frac{\varphi^n-(1-\varphi)^n}{\sqrt{r}}$$ where $\varphi = \frac{1+\sqrt{r}}{2}$ is a manipulated ""golden ratio-equivalent"". So what happens when we use instead of $\sqrt{5}$ another positive root, $\sqrt{r}$? Basically the observation is that when $r = 1+4k, k \in \Bbb N$ (including $k=0$), the elements of the Fibonacci sequences are always integers following the definition. $$F_n = F_{n-2} \cdot k + F_{n-1}$$ being the starting elements $F_0 = 0, F_1=1$ If $r \not =1+4k$, for instance $r=6$, then when using $\sqrt{6}$ at expression ($E1$) the elements of the Fibonacci sequence are not integers. When $k=0$ the Fibonacci sequence is $\{0,1,1,1,1,1...\}$. Always $1$ except $F_0=0$. When $k=1$ so $r=1+4 \cdot 1=5$, then we are using $\sqrt{5}$, providing the classic Fibonacci sequence $\{0,1,1,2,3,5...\}$.: $$F_n = F_{n-2} \cdot (k) + F_{n-1} = F_{n-2} \cdot (1) + F_{n-1} = F_{n-2} + F_{n-1}$$ When $k=2$, to my suprise, we obtain the Jacobsthal sequence : $$F_n = F_{n-2} \cdot (k) + F_{n-1} = F_{n-2} \cdot 2 + F_{n-1}$$ So it seems that the manipulation of the root at expression ($E1$) provides a generalization of the Jacobsthal sequence as follows: $$F_n = F_{n-2} \cdot (k) + F_{n-1}$$ The interesting point (and the questions at the end are related to this) is: What happens if instead of using positive roots to obtain generic Fibonacci-Jacobsthal sequences, we use negative roots? By defining the expression of $r$ as follows: $$r = 1-4k, k>0  \in \Bbb N$$ The result is quite interesting. The expression ($E1$) turns into this: $$F_n = \frac{\varphi^n-(1-\varphi)^n}{(\sqrt{\mid r \mid})i}$$ Where $\varphi = \frac{1+(\sqrt{\mid r \mid})i}{2}$ is the golden ratio-equivalent for the complex plane. The observation in this case is that $F_n$ diverts into positive and negative values (thus, $\Bbb Z$), so the Fibonacci-Jacobsthal sequences are not pure increasing positive sequences when the root applied to ($E1$) is negative, but diverting sequences containing positive and negative numbers. The following image shows both the behavior of positive roots (classic Fibonnaci-Jacobsthal) and negative roots applied into ($E1$) as explained above. The graph represents in the positive $x$ axis the Fibonacci sequences generated for a positive $\sqrt{x}$ root, showing the first $100$ elements of each sequence in the $y$ axis. For instance at $x=0.5$ , the shown $y$ points are the first $100$ elements of the Fibonacci sequence obtained for $\sqrt{0.5}$ applied to ($E1$). As you can see $x=1$ is an special case because for that case $\forall n \gt 1 \in \Bbb N, F_n=1$, except $F_0=0$. That is the reason why all the points seem to ""converge"" to $x=1, y=1$. The classic Fibonacci sequence is located at $x=5$ which is the use of the root $\sqrt{5}$ at ($E1$). It is out of  the scale of the graph at the right side in the positive $x$ axis. But in the other hand, when we use negative roots ($x \lt 0$), so we use $\sqrt{x} = \sqrt{\mid x \mid \cdot (-1)} =  (\sqrt{\mid x \mid }) \cdot \sqrt{(-1)} =(\sqrt{ \mid x \mid })i$ applied to ($E1$), then the Fibonacci-Jacobsthal sequences obtained divert into positive and negative values. In the graph, the $x$ values under $x \lt 0$ represent the negative roots $(\sqrt{\mid x \mid })i$ applied into ($E1$) and the $y$ values are the Fibonacci sequences obtained for each value of $x$. It can be seen the the sequences are not strictly positive increasing sequences: they have negative and positive (complex) terms. There is a very interesting value in the complex plane, when $k=1, r = 1-4k = -3$, this is represented in the graph at $x=-3$, which shows the use of the root $(\sqrt{\mid -3 \mid })i$ into ($E1$). As it can be seen, again the sequences seem to ""converge"", but in this case into three points: $y=1$,$y=0$,and $y=-1$. The sequences associated with the values $x \lt -3$ start to grow up quickly, so the scale does not let to see us a whole view of the evolution of the sequences.

Why are the sequences diverting into positive and negative values? Heuristically I can understand that it really happens, but not the reason. The Fibonacci series according to the manipulations of ($E1$) divert into positive and negative values. But what is the mechanism that makes this happen in the complex plane? Is it due to the complex division applied into ($E1$)? I think that the equivalent to what is happening in the real plane at $x=1$ is happening in the complex plane at $x=-3$. If we see the graph of the Fibonacci sequences as a whole, as in the first graph shown above, they have a ""mirrored"" behavior, meaning that the sequences seem to ""converge"" to some specific points of the positive and negative $x$ axis, and then the sequences start to grow up quickly after that point when $x \to -\infty$ and $x \to \infty$ respectively, and it seems that there is continuity between the elements of each sequence, except at $x=0$ where $E1 \to \infty$. Are the points $(1,1)$, $(-3,-1)$, $(-3,0)$ and $(-3,1)$ some kind of attractor?

When $k=1$ so $r=1+4 \cdot 1=5$, then we are using $\sqrt{5}$, providing the classic Fibonacci sequence $\{0,1,1,2,3,5...\}$.: $$F_n = F_{n-2} \cdot (k) + F_{n-1} = F_{n-2} \cdot (1) + F_{n-1} = F_{n-2} + F_{n-1}$$ When $k=2$, to my suprise, we obtain the Jacobsthal sequence : $$F_n = F_{n-2} \cdot (k) + F_{n-1} = F_{n-2} \cdot 2 + F_{n-1}$$ So it seems that the manipulation of the root at expression ($E1$) provides a generalization of the Jacobsthal sequence as follows: $$F_n = F_{n-2} \cdot (k) + F_{n-1}$$ The interesting point (and the questions at the end are related to this) is: What happens if instead of using positive roots to obtain generic Fibonacci-Jacobsthal sequences, we use negative roots? By defining the expression of $r$ as follows: $$r = 1-4k, k>0  \in \Bbb N$$ The result is quite interesting. The expression ($E1$) turns into this: $$F_n = \frac{\varphi^n-(1-\varphi)^n}{(\sqrt{\mid r \mid})i}$$ Where $\varphi = \frac{1+(\sqrt{\mid r \mid})i}{2}$ is the golden ratio-equivalent for the complex plane. The observation in this case is that $F_n$ diverts into positive and negative values (thus, $\Bbb Z$), so the Fibonacci-Jacobsthal sequences are not pure increasing positive sequences when the root applied to ($E1$) is negative, but diverting sequences containing positive and negative numbers. The following image shows both the behavior of positive roots (classic Fibonnaci-Jacobsthal) and negative roots applied into ($E1$) as explained above. The graph represents in the positive $x$ axis the Fibonacci sequences generated for a positive $\sqrt{x}$ root, showing the first $100$ elements of each sequence in the $y$ axis. For instance at $x=0.5$ , the shown $y$ points are the first $100$ elements of the Fibonacci sequence obtained for $\sqrt{0.5}$ applied to ($E1$). As you can see $x=1$ is an special case because for that case $\forall n \gt 1 \in \Bbb N, F_n=1$, except $F_0=0$. That is the reason why all the points seem to ""converge"" to $x=1, y=1$. The classic Fibonacci sequence is located at $x=5$ which is the use of the root $\sqrt{5}$ at ($E1$). It is out of  the scale of the graph at the right side in the positive $x$ axis. But in the other hand, when we use negative roots ($x \lt 0$), so we use $\sqrt{x} = \sqrt{\mid x \mid \cdot (-1)} =  (\sqrt{\mid x \mid }) \cdot \sqrt{(-1)} =(\sqrt{ \mid x \mid })i$ applied to ($E1$), then the Fibonacci-Jacobsthal sequences obtained divert into positive and negative values. In the graph, the $x$ values under $x \lt 0$ represent the negative roots $(\sqrt{\mid x \mid })i$ applied into ($E1$) and the $y$ values are the Fibonacci sequences obtained for each value of $x$. It can be seen the the sequences are not strictly positive increasing sequences: they have negative and positive (complex) terms. There is a very interesting value in the complex plane, when $k=1, r = 1-4k = -3$, this is represented in the graph at $x=-3$, which shows the use of the root $(\sqrt{\mid -3 \mid })i$ into ($E1$). As it can be seen, again the sequences seem to ""converge"", but in this case into three points: $y=1$,$y=0$,and $y=-1$. The sequences associated with the values $x \lt -3$ start to grow up quickly, so the scale does not let to see us a whole view of the evolution of the sequences.

Why are the sequences diverting into positive and negative values? Heuristically I can understand that it really happens, but not the reason. The Fibonacci series according to the manipulations of ($E1$) divert into positive and negative values. But what is the mechanism that makes this happen in the complex plane? Is it due to the complex division applied into ($E1$)? I think that the equivalent to what is happening in the real plane at $x=1$ is happening in the complex plane at $x=-3$. If we see the graph of the Fibonacci sequences as a whole, as in the first graph shown above, they have a ""mirrored"" behavior, meaning that the sequences seem to ""converge"" to some specific points of the positive and negative $x$ axis, and then the sequences start to grow up quickly after that point when $x \to -\infty$ and $x \to \infty$ respectively, and it seems that there is continuity between the elements of each sequence, except at $x=0$ where $E1 \to \infty$. Are the points $(1,1)$, $(-3,-1)$, $(-3,0)$ and $(-3,1)$ some kind of attractor? Thank you!",,"['sequences-and-series', 'complex-numbers', 'fibonacci-numbers']"

96,Geometric series and complex numbers [duplicate],Geometric series and complex numbers [duplicate],,"This question already has answers here : Sum of a complex, finite geometric series and its identity (1 answer) $\sum \cos$ when angles are in arithmetic progression [duplicate] (1 answer) Closed 8 years ago . I'm new to this site, english is not my mother tongue, and I'm just learning LaTeX. I'm basically a noob, so please be indulgent if I break any rule or habits. I'm stuck at proving the following equation. I suppose I should use the formula for geometric series ($\sum\limits_{k=0}^{n}q^k=\frac{1-q^{n+1}}{1-q}$), and also use somewhere that $e^{î\theta}=cos(\theta)+i\sin(\theta)$ So here is the equation I have to prove : $$\frac{1}{2}+cos(\theta)+cos(2\theta)+...+cos(n\theta)=\frac{sin(n+\frac{1}{2}\theta)}{2sin(\frac{\theta}{2})}$$ Thanks for your help","This question already has answers here : Sum of a complex, finite geometric series and its identity (1 answer) $\sum \cos$ when angles are in arithmetic progression [duplicate] (1 answer) Closed 8 years ago .

97,Analytic continuation of a certain Dirichlet series,Analytic continuation of a certain Dirichlet series,,"Is there an elementary way to analytically continue $$f(s)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)^s}$$ to the entire complex plane? It is not hard to see (by grouping terms in pairs and using the mean value theorem) that it converges for $\Re(z)>0$. I realize there is a vast literature on Dirichlet series that almost certainly answers this with some general theorem. However, this sum appears as a qualifying exam question (1.43), so presumably there is a more direct method. For example, if the terms did not alternate, we could just take $(1-2^{-s})\zeta(s)$ and use the fact $\zeta(s)$ has a continuation to the entire plane.","Is there an elementary way to analytically continue $$f(s)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)^s}$$ to the entire complex plane?

98,Infinite sum of alternating telescoping series,Infinite sum of alternating telescoping series,,"I am struggling to find the sum of the following series: $$\sum_{n=1} ^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n}{(n+1)(n+3)(n+5)}.$$ It seems as though it should be a straightforward telescoping series. I attempted to solve it in the usual way (via partial fractions), but the alternating sign makes the sum so that one cannot cancel out fractions to result in a finite sum of fractions. I know that the series converges by the alternating sign test, and I check on WolframAlpha that the infinite sum converges to $-7/480$. Any thoughts on how to proceed?","I am struggling to find the sum of the following series: $$\sum_{n=1} ^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n}{(n+1)(n+3)(n+5)}.$$ It seems as though it should be a straightforward telescoping series.
