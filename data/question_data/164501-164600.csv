In Folland's book, the following is written in the proof: This is a simple application of the monoticity of the integral. Can someone explain me why this is true? We have to prove that $$\left\|\int_Y f(-,y) d\nu(y)\right\|_\infty\le \int_Y \|f(-,y)\|_\infty d\nu(y)$$ so for example it suffices to show that $$\left|\int_Y f(x,y)d\nu(y)\right|\le \int_Y \|f(-,y)\|_\infty d\nu(y)$$ for $\mu$ -almost every $x \in X$ .

1,Understanding arbitrary currents and currents of integration.,Understanding arbitrary currents and currents of integration.,,"I've been doing some readings, and there are some notational issues with currents that I do not understand. Let $\Omega\subset \mathbb C^n$ be open. A current $T$ of bidegree $(p,q)$ is an element of the dual space $(D^{(n-p,n-q)}(\Omega))'$ where $D^{(n-p,n-q)}(\Omega)$ is the space of test forms (differential forms of bidegree $(p,q)$ with smooth coefficients of compact support). One can define similary define a current of order zero as an element of $(D_0^{(n-p,n-q)}(\Omega))'$ where now the coefficients of the forms are simply continuous with compact support. Alternatively, we can think of $T$ as a differential form with distributional coefficents $T_{I,J}$ : $$ T=\sum_{I,J}T_{I,J}dz^I\wedge d\bar z^J $$ If $T$ is a current of order $0$ , then each $T_{I,J}$ is a Radon measure (a result of Riesz's Theorem). Now, we can define $T_f$ as the current of integration given by $$ T_f(\phi)=\int_{\Omega}f\wedge \phi$$ where $f$ is a $(p,q)$ form and $\phi$ is an $(n-p,n-q)$ form. In this specific case we can write $$ f=\sum_{I,J}f_{I,J} dz^I\wedge d\bar z^J$$ where $f_{I,J}$ are smooth functions (or continuous functions if $T_f$ is of order $0$ ). This is where my confusion starts. Some texts I read say that given a current $T$ , there is the duality pairing given by $$ \langle T,\phi\rangle = \int_{\Omega} T\wedge \phi$$ If $T$ is a current like $T_f$ , then I understand this pairing. Otherwise I don't know how to integrate a differential form WITH distributional (or measure) coefficents. If I can write $T$ as a differential forms with smooth or continuous coeffients, then this pairing makes sense. Another example is given a current $T$ of order zero and a compact set $K\subset\Omega$ , we can define $$ ||T||_K=\int_{K}\sum_{I,J}|T_{I,J}|$$ Given that $T_{I,J}$ are measures, I understand the norm above. One can show that if $T\geq 0$ , then there are positive constants $C_1,C_2$ such that $$ C_1||T||_K\leq \int_K T\wedge \beta^p\leq C_2||T||_K$$ where $\beta$ is the Kahler form.

51,Cardinality of the collection of measurable subsets of metric outer measures,Cardinality of the collection of measurable subsets of metric outer measures,,"It is a well known fact that $\left | B_{\mathbb{R}} \right | = \left | \mathbb{R} \right |$ , the standard proof involving transfinite induction. However, the next 2 statements are also true: If $u$ is a metric outer measure over a metric space $X$ , then every open set of the space is $u$ -measurable. Then, we have as a direct corollary: The Borel sets of $X$ are contained in the collection of $u$ -measurable sets, for every metric outer measure $u$ over $X$ . So, if we could prove the existence of a metric outer measure $u$ (over $\mathbb{R}$ ) such that $\left | M_u \right | = \left | \mathbb{R} \right |$ , with $M_u = \left \{ u- measurable \:sets \right \}$ , then the cardinality of $B_{\mathbb{R}}$ would be immediately deduced. However, this last statement seems at least a little interesting by itself. I gave some thought to it, but what i tried did not work. So, is it possible to prove the existence of such $u$ ? Edit : I decided to start a bounty for this question, so i'm also posting my attempt. I understand that this problem is probably either easier than this, or it is too complex for me to understand fully, but i would still be more comfortable with an answer. I'm not exactly an expert in this field, so please forgive me if this attempt is dumb. I tried other ideas, but they ended up being false. I tried to prove by contradiction that for every metric outer measure over $\mathbb{R}$ we have $\left | M\left ( u \right ) \right | = 2^{\left | \mathbb{R} \right |}$ (i think i had to assume AC and CH, sorry for that). So, by contradiction, suppose that $\left | M\left ( u \right ) \right | < 2^{\left | \mathbb{R} \right |}$ . This means that it is not possible that every uncountable (again, i had to assume CH) set is of infinite $u$ -measure, because if that were the case then we could conclude by the caratheodory condition that $\left | M\left ( u \right ) \right | = 2^{\left | \mathbb{R} \right |}$ . Also (because of CH), none of this uncountable sets can be of $u$ -measure $0$ , because then every subset of this set would be $u$ -measurable, and so (because it is uncountable and CH) we would have again $\left | M\left ( u \right ) \right | = 2^{\left | \mathbb{R} \right |}$ . So then, there exists $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ uncountable such that $ 0 < u\left ( E \right ) < \infty$ . Now, if the next statement is true, then a contradiction can be given (I don't know if it is true, but i think i could show it for several particular cases): ('Borelian decomposition') For very uncountable (i'm assuming CH, as stated above) subset $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ , there exist $\left \{ E_{\alpha} \right \}_{\alpha \in \mathbb{R}} \in B_{\mathbb{R}}$ such that $\left | E_\alpha  \right | = \left | \mathbb{R} \right |$ for every $\alpha$ and $\coprod_{\alpha}^{}E_\alpha = E$ (by this i mean disjoint union) . Now, this statement is true if we remove the condition that each $E_{\alpha}$ is borelian (to see this, take a bijection between $E$ and $\left [ 0, 1 \right ] \times \left [ 0, 1 \right ]$ and take preimages of vertical strands $\left \{ t \right \} \times \left [ 0, 1 \right ]$ for $t$ in the unit interval), but for the final contradiction i need Borelian sets, because they are $u$ -measurable by hypothesis ( $u$ is a metric outer measure). However, i think I could prove this ' Borelian decomposition for the following cases: $E = \mathbb{R}$ : using the same idea of vertical strands but this time with Peano curves. $E$ is a $G_{\delta}$ set (again, always uncountable): In Counterexamples in probability and real analysis , by Gary Wise, it is proven  ( problem 1.20) that for every $A \in G_{\delta}$ uncountable, there exists $B \subseteq A$ closed, nowhere dense, and such that can be mapped continously onto the unit interval (also, it is a null set in lebesgue measure, but i won't be using this property). Applying the same idea of the previous case for $B$ , then we can give a 'Borelian decomposition' for $B$ , and so for $A$ (if $A - B$ is uncountable, then just distribute it´s points over the borelians that constitute the Borelian decomposition of $B$ ) $E \in F_{\sigma}$ The method for this case is similar to the previous one, noticing that every closed set is a $G_{\delta}$ . $E$ is lebesgue measurable with positive measure: This is because in this case there exists a $F \in F_{\sigma}$ and a null set $Z$ such that $E = F \coprod Z$ , and the previous case gives the 'Borelian decomposition'. $E$ is the cantor set : I thought of this in an attempt for a counterexample, but using the Cantor -Lebesgue function i found a 'Borelian decomposition'. I could not prove the decomposition for Lebesgue measure 0 sets, and of course not for Lebesgue non-measurable sets. But, it is still a LITTLE close. Now, to the contradiction, assuming this statement is true: Because of the decomposition, there exist $\left \{ E_{\alpha} \right \}_{\alpha  \in \mathbb{R}}$ with the properties given in the 'Borelian decomposition' statement. Because each $E_{\alpha}$ is uncountable, it must be $u\left ( E_\alpha  \right ) > 0$ , because of the first comments on my attempt (if not true for some $\alpha$ , subsets of this set would be $u$ -measurable). But then, consider the sets $F_n := \left \{ \alpha, u\left ( E_\alpha  \right )> 1/n \right \}$ . Their union form the totality of the $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ , but because of the decomposition, al least ONE of this subsets (name it $F_{n_0}$ ) must be infinite. But then, there exists $\left ( \alpha_i \right )_{i \in \mathbb{N}} \subseteq F_{n_0}$ such that $u\left ( E_{\alpha _i} \right ) > 1/n$ . But, this implies that $E$ would be of infinite $u$ - measure (we can decompose the measure of the disjoint union of the $E_{\alpha _i}$ in a sum of measures because these sets are borelian and thus u-measurable), a contradiction. However, none of the cases true for the 'Borelian decomposition' necessarily work for $E$ , because, $E$ can eventually be of Lebesgue measure $0$ , or also not Lebesgue measurable. Another idea i had was: suppose that $u$ is a regular metric outer measure (additional hypothesis), so the problem can be reduced to measures over $B_{\mathbb{R}}$ and induced outer measures. Then, because of the first comments for the previous attempt, $u\left ( A \right )= 0 \Rightarrow m\left ( A \right )=0$ for every subset $A$ , because only countable subsets can be of $u$ -measure $0$ . So, if WLOG we could suppose that the induced measure over $B_{\mathbb{R}}$ is $\sigma$ -finite, arguments involving (for example) Radon- Nikodym could be used (i tried but got nowhere). However, i think that proceeding this way would only give an answer for regular metric outer measures. If this is wrong, please notify me. Any reference to this problem is also greatly appreciated.","It is a well known fact that , the standard proof involving transfinite induction. However, the next 2 statements are also true: If is a metric outer measure over a metric space , then every open set of the space is -measurable. Then, we have as a direct corollary: The Borel sets of are contained in the collection of -measurable sets, for every metric outer measure over . So, if we could prove the existence of a metric outer measure (over ) such that , with , then the cardinality of would be immediately deduced. However, this last statement seems at least a little interesting by itself. I gave some thought to it, but what i tried did not work. So, is it possible to prove the existence of such ? Edit : I decided to start a bounty for this question, so i'm also posting my attempt. I understand that this problem is probably either easier than this, or it is too complex for me to understand fully, but i would still be more comfortable with an answer. I'm not exactly an expert in this field, so please forgive me if this attempt is dumb. I tried other ideas, but they ended up being false. I tried to prove by contradiction that for every metric outer measure over we have (i think i had to assume AC and CH, sorry for that). So, by contradiction, suppose that . This means that it is not possible that every uncountable (again, i had to assume CH) set is of infinite -measure, because if that were the case then we could conclude by the caratheodory condition that . Also (because of CH), none of this uncountable sets can be of -measure , because then every subset of this set would be -measurable, and so (because it is uncountable and CH) we would have again . So then, there exists uncountable such that . Now, if the next statement is true, then a contradiction can be given (I don't know if it is true, but i think i could show it for several particular cases): ('Borelian decomposition') For very uncountable (i'm assuming CH, as stated above) subset , there exist such that for every and (by this i mean disjoint union) . Now, this statement is true if we remove the condition that each is borelian (to see this, take a bijection between and and take preimages of vertical strands for in the unit interval), but for the final contradiction i need Borelian sets, because they are -measurable by hypothesis ( is a metric outer measure).

75,Decomposition of Unmeasurable Sets into Measurable and Purely Unmeasurable Sets,Decomposition of Unmeasurable Sets into Measurable and Purely Unmeasurable Sets,,"Below is a proof I wrote up that unmeasurable sets can be written as a union of a measurable set and a ""purely unmeasurable"" set. Is this result well-known (it is not very advanced, obviously), and does it hold more generally than given here? Let $\mu^*$ be an outer measure on a set $X$ . If $\mathcal{M} \subset \mathcal{P}(X)$ is the set of $\mu^*$ -measurable subsets of $X,$ then $(X,\mathcal{M},\mu)$ is a measure space, where $\mu = \mu^*|_{\mathcal{M}}$ . We say $\mu^*$ is $\sigma$ -finite if $(X,\mathcal{M}, \mu)$ is a $\sigma$ -finite measure space, i.e. $X = \cup_{j=1}^\infty X_j,$ where $\forall j \in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ , $X_j \in \mathcal{M}$ and $\mu^*(X_j) < \infty.$ Definition 1.  A subset $Y \subset X$ is called purely unmeasurable if $Y$ is not measurable, and for every $Z \subset Y,$ \begin{equation*} Z\ \text{measurable} \ \implies \  \mu^*(Z) = 0. \end{equation*} Proposition 1. Let $\mu^*$ be a $\sigma$ -finite outer measure on $X$ . If $Y \subset X$ is not measurable, then $Y$ can be written $Y = A \cup B,$ where $A$ is purely unmeasurable, $B$ is measurable, and $A \cap B = \emptyset.$ \ \textit{Proof.} First, suppose $\mu^*$ is actually finite. We give an algorithm for forming $A$ and $B.$ This algorithm can, in principle, be applied whether or not $Y$ is not measurable. Initialize $A= Y,$ $B = \emptyset.$ For $\epsilon>0,$ define $$\mathcal{A}_\epsilon = \mathcal{M} \cap \mathcal{P}(A) \cap (\mu^*)^{-1}([\epsilon, \infty]) = \mu^{-1}([\epsilon, \infty]) \cap \mathcal{P}(A).$$ Then the algorithm proceeds as follows. For $n = 1, 2, 3, ...$ , until $\mathcal{A}_{1/n} = \emptyset,$ choose $E \in \mathcal{A}_{1/n}$ and re-define $A := A \setminus E,$ $B = B \cup E.$ The $n$ th such ``until"" loop lasts at-most $\lfloor{n\mu^*(X)}\rfloor$ steps, since $\mu^*(B)$ increases by at least $1/n$ with each iteration; the algorithm therefore calls for at most countably-many iterations. Any $B$ which results from this process is a countable union of measurable sets, and is hence measurable. Since $A = Y \setminus B,$ and $B$ is measurable, if $Y$ is not measurable, then $A$ is not measurable. Let $E$ be a measurable subset of $A$ (at the end of the algorithm).  If $\mu^*(E)>0,$ then there is an $N \in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ so large that $\mu^*(E) > 1/N.$ But then, at the start of the $N$ th iteration of the ``for"" loop, we had $E \in \mathcal{A}_{1/N}.$ The algorithm could not proceed to the $(N+1)$ th iteration, and thus could not have been completed, without the removal of all or part of $E$ from $A.$ In view of this contradiction, we see that there are two possibilities: if $Y$ was measurable to begin with, then $\mu^*(A) = 0.$ If $Y$ is unmeasurable, then $A$ is \emph{purely} unmeasurable. Now assume that $\mu^*$ is $\sigma$ -finite, and write $X = \cup_{j=1}^\infty X_j,$ where $\mu^*(X_j) < \infty$ , and for $i \neq j, X_i \cap X_j = \emptyset.$ For $n = 1,2,3,...$ , let $X_n \cap Y = A_n \cup B_n$ be a decomposition given by the above algorithm. Note that, even though $Y$ is not measurable, it may happen that $X_n \cap Y$ is measurable. This is harmless: in the case that $X_n \cap Y$ is measurable, $A_n$ is a measurable set with $\mu^*(A_n) = 0.$ We define $B = \cup_{n=1}^\infty B_n$ and $A = Y \setminus B.$ Since $B$ is a countable union of measurable sets, it's measurable; since $Y$ is not measurable and $A = Y \setminus B,$ $A$ is also not measurable. Let $E$ be a measurable subset of $A.$ Since $E \cap X_n$ is a measurable subset of $A_n,$ $\mu^*(E \cap X_n) = 0.$ Thus by subadditivity, $\mu^*(E) \leq \sum_{n=1}^\infty \mu^*(E \cap X_n) = 0.$ Hence $A$ is purely unmeasurable.

The demonstration follows by: (i) First proving the case where $F$ is the characteristic function of a measurable set, (ii) then proving the case where $F$ is a simple function by linearity, and, finally, (iii) proving the case where $F$ is a nonnegative measurable arbitrary function.

We have a space $A$ with $\mathbb{A}$ a $\sigma$ -algebra with infinitely many elements. Now I need to show an infinite partition exists. Of course we first need to define what an infinite partition is. It is a countable infinite sequence of non-empty and disjoint sets which union is $A.$ So we know there are infinite elements in the $\sigma$ -algebra. I would argue we need to rearrange the elements of $\mathbb{A}$ to make them countable and then introduce a 'left-overs' subset that contains all elements that are outside of our countable division.
