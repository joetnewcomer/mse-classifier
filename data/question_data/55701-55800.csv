4,Series related to the Mandelbrot set,Series related to the Mandelbrot set,,"Apologies if this question has been asked here before. The Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers $c$ for which the iteration $z_{n+1}(c)=z_n (c)^2+c$ with $z_0(c)=0$ does not diverge (we write $z_\infty(c)=\lim\limits_{n\rightarrow\infty}z_n(c)$ where it converges). Thus every $z_n(c)$ can be written as a polynomial in $c$ of order $2^{n-1}$, so we define: $$z_n(c)=\sum_{j=0}^\infty \beta_{n,j}c^j$$ where $\beta_{n.j}$ is only nonzero for $j\le2^{n-1}$. Using the Mandelbrot iteration formula and the Cauchy product , we get: $$\beta_{n+1,j}=\begin{cases}\sum\limits_{k=0}^j\beta_{n,k}\beta_{n,j-k}&j\ne1\\2\beta_{n,0}\beta_{n,1}+1&j=1\end{cases}\tag{1}$$ Now $\beta_{n,0}=0\;\;\forall n\ge0$ and $\beta_{n,1}=1\;\;\forall n\ge1$ and using $(1)$ we can show that $\beta_{n+1,2}=\beta_{n,1}^2=1\;\;\forall n\ge1$, that $\beta_{n+1,3}=2\;\;\forall n\ge2$ and in general that $\beta_{n,j}=\beta_j\;\;\forall n\ge j$ where: $$\beta_j=\begin{cases}0&j=0\\1&j=1\\\sum\limits_{k=0}^j \beta_k\beta_{j-k}&j\ge2\end{cases}$$ (I calculated the first few terms $0,1,1,2,5,14,42,132,429,...$ by hand, but the OEIS would not give me a general formula). Thus the first $n+1$ terms of $z_n(c)$ are $\beta_i c^i$ as seen here in red: $$z_0(c)=\color{#ff0000}{0}$$ $$z_1(c)=\color{#ff0000}{0+c}$$ $$z_2(c)=\color{#ff0000}{0+c+c^2}$$ $$z_3(c)=\color{#ff0000}{0+c+c^2+2c^3}+\color{#0000ff}{c^4}$$ $$z_4(c)=\color{#ff0000}{0+c+c^2+2c^3+5c^4}+\color{#0000ff}{6c^5+6c^6+4c^7+c^8}$$ and so on. Thus as $n\rightarrow\infty$ the first $n+1$ terms of $z_n(c)$ will tend to the following series: $$z(c)=\sum_{j=0}^\infty\beta_j c^j\tag{2}$$ However, because of the extra $2^{n-1}-n$ terms in $z_n(c)$ (shown in blue), I assume that $\{z_n(c)\}$ will not always converge to $z(c)$, especially since the Mandelbrot set is not a disc (and power series converge within discs), but I do not know of any way of describing the extra terms which will enable a connection to be made between the convergence of the Mandelbrot iteration and the convergence of $(2)$. My questions are the following: For what $c$ are $\color{blue}{the\ blue\ terms}$ small enough that $z(c)=z_\infty(c)$, How if at all is the convergence of $(2)$ connected with the convergence of the iteration $z_{n+1}=z_n^2+c$?

Using numerical methods, I have discovered that the solution [Update: not the solution, but a close approximation for some values.] is the following: $\sum\limits_{j = 1}^{\infty}X^j \prod\limits_{k = 1}^{j}Y^{\alpha^k} = \dfrac{X}{1-X} Y^{\frac{\alpha}{1 - \alpha X}}$ Does anybody know how to prove this analytically?

25,Two series involving the Gamma function,Two series involving the Gamma function,,"The last piece I am left with in my proof is to compute the following two series: $$\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\dfrac{\Gamma(i-d)\Gamma(n-i+d)}{\Gamma(i+1)\Gamma(n-i)(n-i-d)}, \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \dfrac{\Gamma(n-d-i)\Gamma(i+d)}{(i-d)\Gamma(i+1)\Gamma(n-i)},$$ here $n\geq 2$, $d\in(-0.5, 0.5)$.

Therefore, I thought I should use one of the definitions of the $\Gamma$ function. Also I believe it should be something that involves integrals or sums (rather than products) in order to change the order of summation and apply $\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}$ first.

Even if this is a correct way, I cannot see how to go from a triple integral (geometric progression, cumbersome expression) to a triple + single integral, i.e.  $$ \dfrac{B(-d,-d)B(n-2d,d)B(n-i-d,1)  + 2B(-d,n+d)}{2(n-d)} $$ (here I ignore requirements $\mathrm{Re}(x)>0$, $\mathrm{Re}(y)>0$, which can be easily satisfied).

This does not really help, but since there seems to be some particular way to evaluate this kind of series I tried to take some simpler one first and just got annoyed by such an elegant answer (the one I got from Maple, of course): $$\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\dfrac{\Gamma(i-d)\Gamma(n-i+d)i}{\Gamma(i+1)\Gamma(n-i)}=\Gamma(1-d)\Gamma(1+d)(n-1)=\dfrac{d(1-n)\pi}{\sin(\pi(1+d))}$$ (comparing with the very first series above $\frac{1}{n-d-i}$ here is just replaced with $i$).

I came up with a group, and I was wondering if it has a standard name, or if it can be described easily in terms of well-studied objects. (The construction seems interesting to me, but I would rather not reinvent the wheel!) The construction is as follows. Let $T$ be the set of all binary sequences, so any element $t \in T$ is a map $t: \mathbb{Z} \to \{0,1\}$ . Define a map $c: T \to T$ (which I think of as ""cycle"") that changes the zeroth element of a sequence from 0 to 1, or from 1 to 0. That is, for a sequence $t \in T$ , we have: $$ [c(t)](0)=  \begin{cases} 0 & \textrm{if } t(0) = 1\\ 1 & \textrm{if } t(0) = 0 \end{cases} \\ \textrm{and }[c(t)](n) = t(n) \textrm{ for any } n \neq 0. $$ Next, define a map $s: T \to T$ (which I think of as ""shift"") that shifts all the elements of a sequence to the right, so: $$ [s(t)](n) = t(n-1), \textrm{ for any } n \in \mathbb{Z}. $$ My reason for considering these maps is that, by using them together, it seems one can construct binary sequences (say, by setting the zero sequence as a starting point and then specifying a list of instructions like ""do cycle, then shift, then cycle""). One then can ""compose"" two binary sequences by concatenating the lists of operations used to generate them. This gives a way of combining binary sequences different from element-wise operations. Notice that these maps $c$ and $s$ are invertible. We have $c = c^{-1}$ , as switching the zeroth element twice of any sequence leaves the sequence unchanged. The inverse of $s$ acts by shifting all elements of an input sequence to the left. Define the ""binary sequence factory group"", $F$ , as the group generated by these operations $c$ and $s$ , with group element composition given by function composition. This group has an infinite number of elements, corresponding to the fact that there are an infinite number of binary sequences.

Could you help me solve this problem the ""hard way"" ?","Few days ago, I was asked the following question: There are $2$ cities. city $A$ and city $B$ with distance $d$=600km There are $2$ trains with speed of $vt$ = 100km/h. There is $1$ fly with speed of $vf$ = 300km/h. The question: Train 1 goes from city A to city B , while Train 2 goes in the opposite direction.(both start at the same time). the fly starts from train 1 and go to train 2 , than back to train 1 , than back to train 2...etc... What is the distance that the fly passes till the trains cross each other ? The answer is simple - it takes 3 hours for the train to cross -> fly was running 900km($300 \times 3$). I was wondering on the ""hard"" way of solving this problem by actually calculating the distance the fly pass on each stage. It appears to be the sum of a (finite?) series of the distances. Could you help me solve this problem the ""hard way"" ?",,['sequences-and-series']

The notes he gave us say: We will consider a linear difference equation that gives the   Fibonacci sequence. $y(k) + A_1y(k -1) + A_2y(k -2) = \beta$ That's the general form for a difference equation in which each term is formed from the   two preceding terms. We specialize this for our Fibonacci sequence by setting $A_1 = 1, $ >$ >A_2 = 1,$ and $ \beta = 0$. With some rearrangement, we get $y(k) = y(k - 1) + y(k - 2)$ which looks more like the general form for the Fibonacci sequence. To solve the difference equation, we try the solution $y(k) = Br^k$. Plugging that in, we   obtain $Br^{k-2} (r^2 - r - 1) = 0$ I have no idea where the $Br^k$ is coming from nor what it means, and he won't explain it in any sort of terms we can understand. If someone could help me with the basic principle behind finding a closed form with the given information I would be eternally grateful.
