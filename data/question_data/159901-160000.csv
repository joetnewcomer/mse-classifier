4,Exploring extentions of Tetration,Exploring extentions of Tetration,,"Recently I've been kind of curious about tetration, specifically why it doesn't introduce any new inverse functions in the way lower operations do- addition needs subtraction, multiplication needs division and exponentiation needs roots and logs (two inverses because it isn't commutative.) So if the pattern continues, if the next diagonalization of the successor function doesn't perfectly inherit the properties of its predecessor then it should introduce a new inverse. But every description of tetration I see says that it inherits the log and root from exponentiation as the superlog and superroot, but exponentiation loses a fundamental property when it's iterated: associativity. $x^{x^x}$ is different from ${x^x}^x$ . My first theory was that we take for granted that tetration refers to ""top-down"" associativity because ""bottom-up"" is essentially just multiplicative exponentiation, ${(x^x)^x = x^{2x}}$ but it could just as easily be said that roots are just a change in associativity for formulas like ${{(x^y)}/z} \ne {x^{(y/z)}}$ That operation created gaps in the number line, but that led us to the complex numbers. So that made me think, could we have a constructive extension of the number line created by tetration, and could that reconcile the gaps in our ability to define non-integer power tower heights with a single analytic function? $\newcommand{\vc}[3]{\overset{#2}{\underset{#3}{#1}}}$ Unfortunately this theory didn't go anywhere; if I defined a value where ${f({x^{x^x}}) = {{x^x}^x}}$ , it would still have an infinite number of solutions in the complex plane. The reason imaginary numbers are useful because they can be uniquely defined in terms of existing numbers; even though 'i' doesn't have a numeric solution, it provides a unique and reversible solution to the equation ${x = (a+bi)^y}$ for any real numbers a,b and y. With ${z = {x \uparrow\uparrow y}}$ , we don't have a unique solution for y given only x or vice versa.  However, there are countably infinitely many roots which can be represented as a generalized tetrated form of the Lambert W function. ( https://math.eretrandre.org/tetrationforum/attachment.php?aid=1215 ) because ${x^{x^{x^...}} = e^{ln(x)*e^{ln(x)*e^{...}}} = e^{W(ln(a + 2\pi bi))^{W(ln(a + 2\pi bi))^...}}}$ where ${a + 2\pi bi}$ = x. Using this property, we can reduce to a single solution with two parameters: the branch of the W function and the complex component of x reduced by a factor of ${2\pi}$ . So theoretically, an analytic description of tetration wouldn't have 4 inverse relationships, but 5. Of course we generally take for granted that we use the -1 and 0 branches for the W lambert function, but with 5 variables we can define a unique relationship with tetration. To give each part of the relationship a name: $$x = Base$$ $$y = Height$$ $$z = Tetration$$ $$b = Branch$$ $$t = Twist$$ Given this complexity, let's change the notation: $$x = \vc{\overline{\sqrt[y]{z}}}{bWt}{}$$ $$y = \vc{slog_{x}{z}}{bWt}{}$$ $$z = x \vc{\nearrow}{}{bWt} \vc{y}{}{}$$ $$b = x \vc{\nearrow}{}{Wt} \vc{y}{z}{}$$ $$t = x \vc{\nearrow}{}{bW} \vc{y}{z}{}$$ There isn't an analytic function for non-integer values for y, b or t, but a cross-sectional one can be generated provided you have all but one of these variables defined. Let's say you have $$256 = 2 \vc{\nearrow}{}{0W(x)} \vc{3}{}{}$$ This means you have a power tower of three 2's equal to 256 whose solution is on the 0 branch of the W function, which is fine when t is an integer, but when t is .5, x must have the form ${a + (.5)* 2\pi i}$ for a real value a, meaning it must have an imaginary component that is defined independently of i, which 2 does not.  So to reconcile that, we would need a hypercomplex value. If you define specific values for these numbers, theoretically you could map out a 4d topological map of tetration, filling in the holes between the branches of the W function and heights for their respective power towers. I realize this isn't a super rigorous proof, it was just an idea I've been playing around with, so the main things I'm wondering is if: A: This is all actually a constructive solution or if I've been making some leaps on logic, particularly with the lambert W function. B: If it is valid, would 5 be the minimum number of variables or could it be reduced further? C: What's the minimum algebra that would be necessary to describe these values- Quaternions, a Bicomplex or something else? D: Could the same reasoning be extended to pentation, hexation, etc.?","Recently I've been kind of curious about tetration, specifically why it doesn't introduce any new inverse functions in the way lower operations do- addition needs subtraction, multiplication needs division and exponentiation needs roots and logs (two inverses because it isn't commutative.)

5,On a tamely ramified extension of $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$,On a tamely ramified extension of,\mathbb{Q}_{p},"I'm stuck with the following problem given in a book which I'm reading, it's about creating a tamely ramified extension of $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$ . Let $p\in\mathbb{Z}$ be a prime number, and let $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$ be the field of $p$ -adic numbers. Given a finite field extension $K/\mathbb{Q}_{p}$ , let $k$ be the residue field of $K$ . We define the ramification index $e(K/\mathbb{Q}_{p})$ as the index group of the value group of $K$ in the value group of $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$ . Also, we define the inertia/residue degree $f(K/\mathbb{Q}_{p})$ as the degree extension of $k/\mathbb{F}_{p}$ . By a theorem, we know that $[K:\mathbb{Q}_{p}]=e(K:\mathbb{Q}_{p})f(K:\mathbb{Q}_{p})$ . Finally, we say that $K/\mathbb{Q}_{p}$ is tamely ramified if $p\nmid e(K/\mathbb{Q}_{p})$ . Here is the problem. Consider the polynomial $f=\frac{X^{p}-1}{X-1}=X^{p-1}+X^{p-2}+\cdots+1\in\mathbb{Q}_{p}[X]$ . Let $\zeta_{p}$ be a root of $f$ , the claim is that $\mathbb{Q}_{p}(\zeta_{p})/\mathbb{Q}_{p}$ is tamely ramified. Here is my attempt: I have proved that $f$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$ , so let $\zeta_{p}$ be a root of $f$ , then the extension $\mathbb{Q}_{p}(\zeta_{p})/\mathbb{Q}_{p}$ has degree $p-1$ . Since $(p,p-1)=1$ , in order to prove that the extension is tamely ramified, we need to show thet the residue fiel of $\mathbb{Q}_{p}(\zeta_{p})$ is $\mathbb{F}_{p}$ or that the ramification index of $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_{p})/\mathbb{Q}_{p}$ agrees with the degree of the extension, i.e., $p-1$ . My attempt is to show that $\mathbb{F}_{p}$ is the residue field of $\mathbb{Q}_{p}(\zeta_{p})$ . To do this, let $k$ be the residue field of $\mathbb{Q}_{p}(\zeta_{p})$ . It is clear that $\mathbb{F}_{p}\subset k$ . So, to see $k\subset\mathbb{F_{p}}$ , let $x$ in the valuation ring of $\mathbb{Q}_{p}(\zeta_{p})$ , i.e., $|x|\leq 1$ . I can write $x=a+b\zeta_{p}$ , where $a,b\in\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ . If we denote with $\overline{x}$ the class of $x$ in $k$ , we have $\overline{x}=\overline{a}+\overline{b}\overline{\zeta_{p}}$ . Note that $\overline{a},\overline{b}\in\mathbb{F}_{p}$ , so we only need to show $\overline{\zeta_{p}}\in\mathbb{F}_{p}$ . Previously, I proved that $\zeta_{p}=1+\lambda_{1}$ , where $|\lambda_{1}|=p^{-1/(p-1)}<1$ , hence the class of $\lambda_{1}$ is zero, thus $\overline{\zeta_{p}}=\overline{1}$ , which proves that $\overline{x}\in\mathbb{F}_{p}$ , so we can conclude that $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_{p})/\mathbb{Q}_{p}$ is tamely ramified.

6,Grimm's Weak Conjecture,Grimm's Weak Conjecture,,"On Wikipedia it says that the following weaker version of Grimm's conjecture is also still open: ""A product of $k$ consecutive composite numbers has $k$ pairwise distinct prime factors."" Is it true, that this is still open or is there already a proof for it? Motivation My motivation to this question comes from factorization theory: Let $H$ be a monoid, i.e. a commutative cancellative semigroup with identity element. An element $a \in H$ is called a strong atom , if it is an atom (i.e. irreducible) and for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ the only facorization of $a^k \in H$ into atoms is $a\cdot...\cdot a$ (where $a$ appears $k$ times). Let $\text{Int}(\mathbb{Z}) = \{ f \in \mathbb{Q}[x] \mid f(\mathbb{Z}) \subseteq \mathbb{Z} \}$ be the ring of integer-valued polynomials and consider the multiplicative monoid $H = \text{Int}(\mathbb{Z}) \setminus \{0 \}$ of non-zero elements. It is known that the factorization behaviour of this monoid is very rich. For instance, for every list of integers $n_1,...,n_k \geq 2$ there exists $f \in H$ such that $f$ has exactly $k$ different (up to order and multiplication by units) factorizations into atoms and the lengths of these factorizations are exactly $n_1,...,n_k$ . The construction for the result in the preceeding paragraph only uses a very restricted pool of polynomials and does not give much information about atoms, though. That is why one is interested in a better understanding of these smallest multiplicative bricks and considers examples: It is well-known since a long time that for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the polynomial $\binom{x}{n} = \frac{x(x-1)...(x-n+1)}{n!} \in H$ is an atom. These so-called binomial polynomials are of particular interest, because taken together the form a $\mathbb{Z}$ -module basis of $\text{Int}(\mathbb{Z})$ . It is conjectured that the binomial polynomials are strong atoms. This is already known for several special cases. A particularly easy case is when $n$ is prime. More generally, it turns out that the distribution of prime numbers between $\max \{p \in \mathbb{P} \mid p \leq n \}$ and $n$ is crucial for the proof of the conjecture.

Using Perron's Formula and defining $D(x) = \sum_{k \leq x} \sigma_0(n)$ , where $\sigma_0$ is the usual divisor counting function, one can show that $$D(x) = \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \int_{c - i \infty}^{c + i \infty} \zeta^2(\omega) \frac{x^\omega}{\omega} \ d \omega.$$ So, to that end one can just compute $D(8)$ and call it a day.

In contemplating The amount of $n$ so that $n!+1$ is divisible by $p$ I confronted the above question, which I was unable to resolve in my own thinking. For odd $p$ , $(p-1)!$ has an even number of multiplicands which can be paired as follows: $1,p-1;\ 2,p-2;\ \dots \frac{p-1}{2},p-\frac{p-1}{2}$ . Modulo $p$ these pairings are $1,-1;\ 2,-2;\ \dots$ etc. If we multiply the first member of each pair, and then the second member of each pair we see that $$\prod_{i=1}^{\frac{p-1}{2}}i\equiv (-1)^{\frac{p-1}{2}}\prod_{i=p-\frac{p-1}{2}}^{p-1}|i|\ \bmod p$$ Since the magnitudes of the multiplicands in each product are equal, the magnitudes of the products are equal, and the products differ if at all only by sign. Moreover, from Wilson's theorem, we know that the product of every multiplicand $(p-1)!\equiv -1 \bmod p$ When $p$ has the form $4k+1$ , $(-1)^{\frac{p-1}{2}}=1$ . So the two products are equal, and their product is congruent to $-1 \bmod p$ . When $p$ has the form $4k+3$ , $(-1)^{\frac{p-1}{2}}=-1$ . In that case, the products have equal magnitudes and opposite signs, and their product is congruent to $-1 \bmod p$ . If we call that magnitude $a$ , we have $-a^2\equiv -1 \bmod p\ \Rightarrow a^2\equiv 1 \bmod p$ . This requires $a\equiv \pm1 \bmod p$ The upshot of this is that for $p=4k+3$ , $$\left(\frac{p-1}{2}\right)! \equiv \pm1 \bmod p$$ I found this question proving that point, but not answering the question I pose below.

For odd , has an even number of multiplicands which can be paired as follows: . Modulo these pairings are etc. If we multiply the first member of each pair, and then the second member of each pair we see that Since the magnitudes of the multiplicands in each product are equal, the magnitudes of the products are equal, and the products differ if at all only by sign. Moreover, from Wilson's theorem, we know that the product of every multiplicand When has the form , . So the two products are equal, and their product is congruent to . When has the form , . In that case, the products have equal magnitudes and opposite signs, and their product is congruent to . If we call that magnitude , we have .

Recall that we say an integral domain $A$ is a Krull domain if \begin{align*} &\text{(1) }A = \bigcap_{P \in S} A_P, \text{ where $S$ is the set of minimal primes of $A$.} \\ &\text{(2) } A_P \text{ is a DVR for all $P \in S$.} \\ &\text{(3) } \text{For all $a \in A \setminus \{0\}$, $a$ is in only finitely many $P \in S$.} \end{align*} We also say that $\{A_P \,:\, P \in S\}$ is the set of essential valuation rings. In the proof of Proposition 6, he defines a Krull domain \begin{align*} B = F[X_1,Y_1,Z_1, \dots, X_i, Y_i, Z_i, \dots ] \end{align*} ( $F$ is a field and $i \in J$ , where $J$ is an arbitrary index set), and \begin{align*} R_i = F[\dots,X_i,Y_i,W_i,\dots] \end{align*} where $W_i = X_iZ_i$ .  Form the ideals $(X_i,Y_i)$ in $R_i$ , from which we get some valuations $v_i(r) = t$ if $r \in Q_i^t$ and $r \notin Q_i^{t+1}$ .  These can be extended to the quotient field of $R_i$ which is the same as the quotient field for $B$ , and we denote $V_i$ to be the corresponding valuation rings.  Now, $B$ is a UFD, so $B = \bigcap_P B_P$ , where $P$ ranges over all minimal primes of $B$ .  The goal is to show that $A = \left(\bigcap_i V_i \right)\cap B$ is a Krull domain with essential valuation rings $\Sigma = \{V_i\} \cup \{B_P\}$ . I can see that $A = \bigcap_i V_i \cap \bigcap_P B_P$ and that the elements of $A$ can only appear in finitely many of the minimal primes corresponding to the rings in $\Sigma$ . I don't see why $\Sigma$ is the set of essential valuation rings. In the paper, Claborn claims: ""To see this, we need only produce an element of the quotient field which is not in a particular ring of $\Sigma$ but is in all other rings of $\Sigma$ ."" In my mind, we need to check that if $P_0$ is a minimal prime such that $A_{P_0} \notin \Sigma$ , then somehow the claim above should contradict the minimality of $P_0$ .  Is this right?  Also, is showing the claim for a given set of valuation rings enough to show that set is essential in any Krull domain, or is it just true in this specific example?

My question was, for which numbers $n$ does no integer below $n$ reach $n$ in its iteration?  So I wrote a program to find all the ones that have that property and I quickly realized all multiples of 3 do. Obviously, because $3n + 1$ can never be a multiple of 3 and if it's not already a multiple of 3, dividing by 2 obviously won't make it one. However, what I noticed after that is that the rest of the numbers are almost all primes. Only some primes, however, and I'm not sure what the criteria for it is. A small percent of them are also numbers that have some number of prime factors, and as you go up into the higher numbers of course the number of prime factors on average increases. None of these numbers are even for unknown reasons to me that I'm sure I could figure out if I looked hard enough. Consequently, the percent of these numbers that are prime decreases as you go for higher values of $n$ , but remains higher than you'd expect. Of course, there are lots of primes because any number in the list has to be odd, and can't be divisible by 3 because I excluded those because they're trivial. However, my question is, what, if any, are the criteria for any number that satisfies this property (no integer below $n$ reaches $n$ in its iteration)?

Note $B(n)=B_n$ when n is a positive integer. (1) $\quad B(s)=(-1)^{s-1}\,s\,\zeta(1-s)$ The following two figures illustrate the real and imaginary parts of the $B(s)$ function defined in formula (1) above. The red discrete portion of Figure (1) illustrates the evaluation of the real part of $B(s)$ defined in formula (1) where $s=n$ and n is a positive integer, and the red discrete portion of Figure (2) illustrates the evaluation of the imaginary part of $B(s)$ defined in formula (1) at integer values of $s$ . Note the imaginary part of $B(s)$ always seem to evaluate to zero at negative as well as positive integers. Also note $B(0)$ as defined in formula (1) above is indeterminate but seems to converge to $B_0=1$ in a limit sense. Figure (1): Illustration of real part of $B(s)$ Figure (2): Illustration of imaginary part of $B(s)$ The following conjectured formulas are refinements of formulas defined in my three previous questions on the Dirichlet eta function , Riemann zeta function , and Bernoulli number function . (2) $\quad \eta(s)=\underset{m\to\infty}{\text{lim}}\left(\frac{1}{2^m}\sum\limits_{n=1}^m\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n^s}\sum\limits_{i=0}^{m-n}\binom{m}{m-n-i}\right)$ (3) $\quad \zeta(s)=\underset{m\to\infty}{\text{lim}}\left(\frac{1}{2^m\left(1-2^{1-s}\right)}\sum\limits_{n=1}^m\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n^s}\sum\limits_{i=0}^{m-n}\binom{m}{m-n-i}\right)\,,\quad s\ne 1+\frac{2\,π\,i\,k}{\log(2)}$ (4) $\quad B(s)=\underset{m\to\infty}{\text{lim}}\left(\frac{(-1)^{s-1}\,s}{2^m\,\left(1-2^s\right)}\sum\limits_{n=1}^m (-1)^{n-1} n^{s-1}\sum\limits_{i=0}^{m-n}\binom{m}{m-n-i}\right)\,,\quad s\ne \frac{2\,π\,i\,k}{\log(2)}$ Formulas (2), (3), and (4) above are related and a proof of any one of these would imply the correctness of all three formulas. Formulas (2), (3), and (4) above for $\eta(s)$ , $\zeta(s)$ and $B(s)$ are illustrated following the questions below. With respect to formula (2) above, if one defines $a(m,n)=\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{2^m}\sum\limits_{i=0}^{m-n} \binom{m}{m-n-i}$ then I believe $\underset{m\to\infty}{\text{lim}}\left(a(m,n)\right)=(-1)^{n-1}$ where smaller values of $n$ converge much faster than larger values of $n$ . This explains why $\eta(s)=\underset{m\to\infty}{\text{lim}}\left(\sum\limits_{n=1}^m\frac{a(m,n)}{n^s}\right)$ which is equivalent to formula (2) above evaluates much differently than $\eta(s)=\underset{m\to\infty}{\text{lim}}\left(\sum\limits_{n=1}^m\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n^s}\right)$ which only converges for $\Re(s)>0$ . I've reviewed formulas for $\eta(s)$ and $\zeta(s)$ on Wikipedia and Wolfram MathWorld and haven't found any formulas similar to formulas (2) and (3) above. I believe formulas (2) and (3) evaluate exactly correct when $s$ is a non-positive integer and $|s|\le m-1$ .

40,Number theoretical function with logarithmic properties,Number theoretical function with logarithmic properties,,"Introduction This is all about the function $v_a(x)$ , what i could find about it and what questions i still have. First of all, I define $v_a(x)$ as the function that counts how often $x$ is divisible by $a$ with $x>0,a>1$ and $x,a \in \mathbb{N}$ . For example $v_2(24)=3$ because $24$ is $3$ times divisible by $2$ , whereas $v_2(3)=0$ because $3$ is not divisible by $2$ . To make $v_a(x)$ a little more general, I introduced the rule, that $v_a(a^n) = n$ iff $a^n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $n\in\mathbb{Q}$ Now things as $v_4(2) = \frac 12$ are possible (Which, if you think about it, makes kind of sense). I first thought about it when i was playing a little bit with the Collatz-conjecture ( here ). I noticed that Collatz function can be redefined involving $v(x)$ as $3\frac x{2^{v(x)}}+1$ ( $v(x)$ without a base always refers to $v_2(x)$ ). Logarithmic properties One of the most important properties of the $v$ function is that $$v_a(x*y)=v_a(x)+v_a(y)$$ and its trivial to see why. If you look at the properties of $v_a(x)$ so far, they are very similar to the logarithmic function. And we can even prove that $$\max(v_a(x))=\log_a(x)$$ Proof: Assume that there exist $n\in\mathbb{N}$ so that $$v_a(n) > log_a(n)$$ Note that we can write every natural number as $ka^b$ with $k,a,b\in\mathbb{N}; a,k>0; \gcd(a,k) =1$ Therefore $$v_a(ka^b)>\log_a(ka^b)$$ $$v_a(k)+v_a(a^b)>\log_a(k)+\log_a(a^b)$$ $$0+b>\log_a(k)+b$$ $$0>log_a(k)$$ $\unicode{x21af}$ This is a contradiction simply because $k\in\mathbb{N}$ Other results Here are all my resuts about the $v$ function: By definition, the equality $$\prod_{p\in\mathbb{P}} p^{v_p(x)}=n$$ holds for every $n\in\mathbb{N}$ $$\implies \sum_{p\in\mathbb{P}} \frac {v_p(x)}{\log_p(x)}=1$$ Other things that I managed to prove are $$\sum_{n=1}^x v_n(x)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty v_n(x)$$ or that $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac1{v_a(n)+1}$$ diverges (not very hard to prove results). But the more interesting things are $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac {z^{v_a(n)}}{n^s} = \zeta(s)\frac {a^s-1}{a^s-z}$$ for $s>1;a\neq1;z\neq0;a^s\neq z$ which is also quite easy to prove using the Euler product ( here ) My most recent result is $$-\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac {v_a(n)}{n^s}=\zeta(s)^2\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac {v_a(n)}{n^s}\mu(n)$$ where $\mu(x)$ is the Möbius function ( here ) (Which is equal to - $\frac {\zeta(s)}{a^s-1}$ see Edit 4 ). This equality can be proved using Möbius inversion ( here ) altough the proof is not that easy. If anyone wants to prove it, they are welcome to try and share. I would love to see someone find a simple proof. Last note and open question Even though it's not really much I found and im not a real mathematician, I think it's quite interesting. I dont know, if this function has already been studied, I couldn't find it anywhere. But if someone knows where to search, I would be happy about references and known results. Or maybe you can come up with other interesting or related stuff. If I´ll find anything else, I´ll make an edit and write it in here. The only thing I couldnt figure out was a closed form expression of $v_a(n)$ or a formula to calculate it's value. And I really tried. That was frustrating. So if you find a formula, please share it. Share any of your thoughts about $v_a(n)$ if you like. Edits Edit 1 if you plot $v(x)$ for natural number it gives a fractal-like structur. I think maybe $v(x)$ could be calculated iteratively. Also, here is the python code: def v(a, x):     if a > 1 and x > 0:         count = 0         while x % a == 0:             x /= a             count += 1         return count     else:         return False Edit 3 Here is the wikipedia page to this function Edit 4 See @reuns comment","Introduction This is all about the function , what i could find about it and what questions i still have. First of all, I define as the function that counts how often is divisible by with and . For example because is times divisible by , whereas because is not divisible by . To make a little more general, I introduced the rule, that iff and Now things as are possible (Which, if you think about it, makes kind of sense).

46,Relationship between $\theta$ functions and number fields.,Relationship between  functions and number fields.,\theta,"I'm trying to have a clear picture of the relationship of theta functions and $L$ -functions, and the geometric objects they relate to. Firstly, I know that $\theta$ -functions arise as sections of line bundles on abelian varieties. So if you take a lattice $\Lambda$ in $V=\mathbb{C}^g$ and a polarization $H$ (i.e a hermitian form on $V$ such that $E=Im(H)$ is definite positive and integral on $\Lambda$ ) you get an abelian variety $X=V/\Lambda$ and a class of line bundles $L(H, \bullet)$ . If you specify a quasi-character of $H$ , then you get a well definied line bundle $L$ on $X$ whose 1st chern class is $E$ . So far this is clear. From the data of $\Lambda$ alone, you get a family of $\theta$ functions, which correspond to all sections of all the line bundles on $X$ . Basically $\theta$ -functions are paramterized by a lattice, a polarization and a quasi-character. You can also parametrize them by an element in the Siegel half space, a polarization and a quasi-character. Now on the other hand $L$ -functions arise as Mellin Transform of $\theta$ -functions (up to Euler/Gamma-factors). For instance the Riemann Zeta function satsifies $$\pi^{-s/2}\Gamma(s/2)\zeta(s)=Mel(\theta(it)-1, s)$$ with $\theta(z)=\sum_{m\in \mathbb{Z}}e^{i\pi m^2z}$ the Jacobi theta function. Of course the term $it$ in $Mel(\theta(it)-1, s)$ makes me think that $it$ lives in $\mathbb{H}$ the upper half plane, but I don't think that should be relevant because the variable $t$ is the one integrated in the Mellin transform so it's not a fixed parameter that I could interpret as corresponding to some lattice. So my (rather blurry) question is : what is the relationship between the ""abelian variety"" picture of theta functions, and the zeta functions of number field arrising as Mellin transforms of the same $\theta$ -functions. The naive picture I have in mind (which is probably not true) is the following. If you take $k$ a number field, its ring of integer gives you via the canonnical embedding a lattice $\Lambda$ in some vector space $\mathbb{C}^g$ (obvisouly there are some problems already, as the dimension of $\mathbb{R}^{s+t}$ has no reason to be even in general). The abelian variety $X=\mathbb{C}^g/\Lambda$ has a polarization (coming from the trace on the number field ?) and thus a line bundle, unique up to translation which has a section defined by a $\theta$ function, such that $\zeta_k$ is essentially the Mellin transform of that $\theta$ -function. Now what is wrong with that picture? How far is it from what actually happens? And what is the real picture? I've seen $\theta$ -functions in the context of $L$ -functions, parametrized by all sorts of parameters, e.g Neukirch writes $$\theta_\Gamma(a,b,z)=\sum_{g\in \Gamma}N(a+g)e^{i\pi((a+g)z, a+g)+2i\pi(b,g)}$$ in this case can I interpret $\theta_\Gamma(a,b,z)$ as a section on some line bundle on $\mathbb{C}^d/\Gamma$ ? I feel like those $(a,b)$ should be some $(H,\alpha)$ for some ""natural"" $(H,\alpha)$ , am I completely mistaken here?","I'm trying to have a clear picture of the relationship of theta functions and -functions, and the geometric objects they relate to.

The triple $(A,B,C)$ is called an ABC-triple if the radical of the product $ABC$ is smaller then $C$ . The radical of a positive integer $n$ , denoted $\operatorname{rad}(n)$ , is the product of the distinct prime factors of $n$ . For instance $\operatorname{rad}(20)=2.5=10$ . The smallest ABC-triple is $(1,8,9)$ as $\operatorname{rad}(1.8.9)=6<9$ . There is a database with all ABC-triples with $C<10^{18}$ . I noticed that the product $A*B*C$ is unique, but can we prove it ? If the hypothesis is true, we can use it to split the Dirichlet series $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\operatorname{rad}(n)^t}{n^s}=\prod_{p,prime}{(1+\frac{p^t}{p^s-1})}$$ into two disjunct sets with $n=A*B*C$ and $n \ne A*B*C$ . Note that the ABC-triples $(128,3645,3773)$ and $(648,3125,3773)$ have the same radical as $\operatorname{rad}(ABC)=2.3.5.7.11$ .

78,Is it possible to isolate and thereby by integration compute a zeta zero gap when accentuating the zeros and counting them?,Is it possible to isolate and thereby by integration compute a zeta zero gap when accentuating the zeros and counting them?,,"The starting point is this integrable formula for the von Mangoldt function: $$\Lambda(n)=\lim\limits_{s \rightarrow 1} \zeta(s)\sum\limits_{d|n} \frac{\mu(d)}{d^{(s-1)}}$$ We can plot the Dirichlet series: $$f(N,t)=\Re\left(\zeta(1/2+it)\sum\limits_{\substack{n=1 \\ d|n}}^{N} \frac{\mu(d)}{n \cdot t \cdot d^{1/2+it-1}}\right)$$ on the critical line: where the red curve is: $$g(N,t)=\frac{H_{\text{N}}+\frac{\partial \vartheta (t)}{\partial t}}{t}$$ where $\vartheta (t)$ is the Riemann-Siegel theta function, and $H_{\text{N}}$ is a Harmonic number. Dividing the Dirichlet series with the asymptotic we get: $$\frac{f(N,t)}{g(N,t)}$$ Part of the question is if this division with $g(N,t)$ can be avoided and the then possibly integrable function later still can be achieved. Now consider the integrable (zeta zero) counting function: which was generated by integrating the Euler-Maclaurin formula over the Möbius $\mu(d)$ function of the divisors of $n$ and adding Riemann-Siegel theta $\vartheta(t)$ as R. Manzoni does: $$N(t)=\frac{1}{\pi}\left(\vartheta (t)-\Re\left(\sum _{n=1}^{\text{nn}} \frac{1}{n^c} \left(\underset{d \mid n}{\sum\limits_{d=1}^{n}} \left(f(\frac{1}{2}+it, d)-f(\frac{1}{2}+i0, d) \right)\right)\right)\right)$$ where: $$f(s,d)=-i \mu (d) \left(\sum _{n=0}^{q-1} \left(\sum _{i=0}^{2 n+1} -\frac{d B_{2 (n+1)} k^{-2 n-1} \left|S_{2 n+1}^{(i)}\right| \log ^{-i-1}(d k) \Gamma (i+1,s \log (k d))}{(2 (n+1))!}\right)+\sum _{n=2}^k -\frac{d^{1-s} n^{-s}}{\log (d)+\log (n)}+\text{If}\left[d=1 \text{ then } 0\text{ else }-\frac{1^{-s} d^{1-s}}{\log (d)+\log (1)}\right]+\frac{d^{1-s} k^{-s}}{2 (\log (d)+\log (k))}+\text{Ei}(-(s-1) \log (d)-(s-1) \log (k))\right)$$ If something was lost in translation then the correct formula is found in the Mathematica program here at the end of this answer .

Dividing the Dirichlet series with the asymptotic we get: $$\frac{f(N,t)}{g(N,t)}$$ Part of the question is if this division with $g(N,t)$ can be avoided and the then possibly integrable function later still can be achieved. Now consider the integrable (zeta zero) counting function: which was generated by integrating the Euler-Maclaurin formula over the Möbius $\mu(d)$ function of the divisors of $n$ and adding Riemann-Siegel theta $\vartheta(t)$ as R. Manzoni does: $$N(t)=\frac{1}{\pi}\left(\vartheta (t)-\Re\left(\sum _{n=1}^{\text{nn}} \frac{1}{n^c} \left(\underset{d \mid n}{\sum\limits_{d=1}^{n}} \left(f(\frac{1}{2}+it, d)-f(\frac{1}{2}+i0, d) \right)\right)\right)\right)$$ where: $$f(s,d)=-i \mu (d) \left(\sum _{n=0}^{q-1} \left(\sum _{i=0}^{2 n+1} -\frac{d B_{2 (n+1)} k^{-2 n-1} \left|S_{2 n+1}^{(i)}\right| \log ^{-i-1}(d k) \Gamma (i+1,s \log (k d))}{(2 (n+1))!}\right)+\sum _{n=2}^k -\frac{d^{1-s} n^{-s}}{\log (d)+\log (n)}+\text{If}\left[d=1 \text{ then } 0\text{ else }-\frac{1^{-s} d^{1-s}}{\log (d)+\log (1)}\right]+\frac{d^{1-s} k^{-s}}{2 (\log (d)+\log (k))}+\text{Ei}(-(s-1) \log (d)-(s-1) \log (k))\right)$$ If something was lost in translation then the correct formula is found in the Mathematica program here at the end of this answer .

Let $E = \mathbb{Q}[x]/(f(x))$ be the field obtained by adjoining a single root  of $f$, and let $L$ be the splitting field of $f$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. The Galois group $\textrm{Gal}(L/\mathbb{Q})$ is isomorphic to $S_3$. In the paper, Serre lets $\rho$ be the ""natural"" embedding of $S_3$ into $\textrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ (which I assume is the representation of $S_3$ as a dihedral group of rotation and reflection matrices) and considers the associated Artin-L function $$L(\rho,s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{a_n}{n^s}.$$ He goes on to say that we can characterize the above function by $$L(\rho,s) = \zeta_E(s)/\zeta(s),$$ where $\zeta$ is the Riemann-zeta function and $\zeta_E$ is the Dedekind zeta function of the number field $E$. He says that this is equivalent to saying that $\rho \oplus 1$ (presumably $1$ denotes the trivial representation of $S_3$) is isomorphic to the 3-dimensional permutation representation of $S_3$. I understand that if $\nu$ is the permutation representation of $S_3$ (i.e. the regular representation), then the Artin $L$-function $L(\nu,s)$ is equal to the Dedekind zeta function $\zeta_L(s)$. In particular, the $L$-function associated to the trivial representation should just be the usual Riemann zeta function. I also know that the Artin $L$-function of a sum of representations is given by the product of the $L$-functions. So this should say that $$\zeta_L(s) = L(\rho \oplus 1,s) = L(\rho,s)\zeta(s),$$ which would give us $L(\rho,s) = \zeta_L(s)/\zeta(s)$ instead. The other part I am having trouble with is the following: Serre claims that since $S_3$ is a dihedral group, Hecke's theory applies and shows that the power series $F(\tau) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_nq^n, q = e^{2\pi i\tau}$ is a cusp form of weight $1$ and level $23$.

So this should say that $$\zeta_L(s) = L(\rho \oplus 1,s) = L(\rho,s)\zeta(s),$$ which would give us $L(\rho,s) = \zeta_L(s)/\zeta(s)$ instead. The other part I am having trouble with is the following: Serre claims that since $S_3$ is a dihedral group, Hecke's theory applies and shows that the power series $F(\tau) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_nq^n, q = e^{2\pi i\tau}$ is a cusp form of weight $1$ and level $23$. I can't seem to find the specific result of Hecke being used here and would like a reference. Thank you.",,"['number-theory', 'proof-explanation', 'modular-forms', 'l-functions']"
