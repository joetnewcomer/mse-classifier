15,Nested trig functions (incl. inverse trig functions),Nested trig functions (incl. inverse trig functions),,"Edit: Although this problem has received a kind answer, I would still appreciate more comprehensive explanation. I am still rather confused. This problem has confused me a bit: The standard method is one I know well: Draw a right triangle, set the adjacent and hypotenuse to: $(2x+1)$ and $\sqrt {17}$ , respectively; then use the Pythagorean theorem to solve for the third side. Then it is easy to find the sine by taking the opposite over the hypotenuse. Alas, I feel uncomfortable about this method -- it feels like it's glossing over something. Why can we assume that $\arccos(2x+1/\sqrt {17})$ describes an angle in a RIGHT triangle? The range of $\arccos$ is, after all, zero to $\pi$ -- which obviously includes some values that are too large for a right triangle. So what gives? Why does the method mentioned above work? Shouldn't we be using unit circle trigonometry rather than the basic right triangle definition? And, while we're at it, I may as well bring up another similar problem that confused me: $$\sec(\arctan(\frac{x}{x-1})$$ The teacher said the answer was $\frac{\sqrt{2x^2+1}}{\lvert x-1\rvert}$ Why the absolute value on the denominator? I still can't figure that out. Of course, in a triangle all sides must have positive length, but that doesn't mean we can't have negative values for trig functions!","Edit: Although this problem has received a kind answer, I would still appreciate more comprehensive explanation. I am still rather confused. This problem has confused me a bit: The standard method is one I know well: Draw a right triangle, set the adjacent and hypotenuse to: and , respectively; then use the Pythagorean theorem to solve for the third side. Then it is easy to find the sine by taking the opposite over the hypotenuse. Alas, I feel uncomfortable about this method -- it feels like it's glossing over something. Why can we assume that describes an angle in a RIGHT triangle? The range of is, after all, zero to -- which obviously includes some values that are too large for a right triangle. So what gives? Why does the method mentioned above work? Shouldn't we be using unit circle trigonometry rather than the basic right triangle definition? And, while we're at it, I may as well bring up another similar problem that confused me: The teacher said the answer was Why the absolute value on the denominator? I still can't figure that out.

MY ATTEMPTION From LHS in entry 3 in photo i shift $\frac{\pi}{4}$ to right,and for the another term i have done the following simple step $$\sum_{k=1}^{2n+1} \arctan(\frac{1}{n+k}) =\sum_{k=n+1}^{3n+1} \arctan(\frac{1}{k}) $$ MY PROBLEM How the RHS of the above EQn is converted in the picture using taylor's theorem ? HOW ? $$\sum_{k=n+1}^{3n+1} \arctan(\frac{1}{k})=  \sum_{k=n+1}^{3n+1} [\frac{1}{k}+O(\frac{1}{k^3})]$$ AND in the next step RHS just converted i.e. $$\sum_{k=n+1}^{3n+1} \frac{1}{k} + O(\frac{1}{n^2})$$ please help me, i dont know what is this O(x) and how it is generated from taylor's theorem ? after that step i know how it is converted into riemann sum when limit tends to infinity i.e. $$\sum_{k=n+1}^{3n+1} \frac{1}{k} =\sum_{k=1}^{2n+1} \frac{1}{n+k} = \sum_{k=1}^{2n} \frac{1}{n+k}+\frac{1}{3n}$$ now for limit tends to infinity $$\lim_{n\to\infty} \sum_{k=1}^{2n} \frac{1}{n+k}  + \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{3n}= \lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^{2n} \frac{1}{1+\frac{k}{n}}=\int_{0}^{2} \frac{dx}{x+1} = \log{3}$$ SORRY for mistakes, this is my first question.",,"['calculus', 'trigonometry', 'notation', 'harmonic-numbers']"
