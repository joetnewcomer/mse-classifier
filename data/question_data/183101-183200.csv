For , I drew diagrams where < , where = , and where > , and for , I did the same for and . It appears to me that when is surjective, is not necessarily surjective, because you could draw the functions out like this: This makes sense to me as a counterexample, but I'm not sure if that's right. Next, as for being injective when is injective, I found a proof (see problem 3.3.7 part a at the top of the first page) that explained that this is true, but I didn't really understand the explanation. Also, when I drew it out myself trying to find an example for which it would be false, I found this: And it seems to me to show that when is injective, is not necessarily injective, but that contradicts the proof that I found online. The only two possibilities are that the proof I found was wrong, or that I'm drawing these functions and sets incorrectly and breaking some rule(s) that I'm unaware of. Any insight into what I'm doing wrong with my drawings, my logic, or into how to go about correctly solving this problem would be hugely appreciated.

86,Why is $\tan x$ not a continuous function?,Why is  not a continuous function?,\tan x,"My textbook defines a continuous function as follows: The function $f(x)$ is continuous if, for all $a$ in its domain, $\lim_{x\rightarrow a} f(x)$ exists and is equal to $f(a)$.

So it appears that $\tan x$ is continuous. However, I already know that it isn't continuous at $x=\frac{(2k+1)\pi}{2}$. Does this still mean it is continuous because it agrees with the definition?

A continuous function satisfies this condition for all values of $a$ in its domain, so the graph of a continuous function is unbroken."" Question: I'm assuming the book's definition is wrong?
