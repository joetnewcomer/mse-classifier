1,Hartshorne exercise 1.8,Hartshorne exercise 1.8,,"Question : Let $Y$ be an affine variety of dimension $r$ in $\mathbb A^n$ . Let, $H$ be a hypersurface in $\mathbb A^n$ and assume that $Y\nsubseteq H$ . Then every irreducible component of $Y\cap H$ has dimension $r-1$ . Answer :Let, $V$ be an irreducible component of $Y\cap H$ . Then, $\dim V=\dim k[x_1,\cdots ,x_n]/\mathcal{I}(V)$ . Now, $V\subseteq Y\cap H\subseteq Y$ . This implies, $\mathcal{I}(V)\supseteq\mathcal{I}(Y\cap H)\supseteq\mathcal{I}(Y)$ . So, \begin{align*} \dim V &=\dim\frac{\frac{k[x_1,\cdots ,x_n]}{\mathcal{I}(Y)}}{\frac{\mathcal{I}(V)}{\mathcal{I}(Y)}}\\ &=\dim\frac{k[x_1\cdots ,x_n]}{\mathcal{I}(Y)}-\text{ht}\frac{\mathcal{I}(V)}{\mathcal{I}(Y)}\\ &=r-\text{ht}\frac{\mathcal{I}(V)}{\mathcal{I}(Y)} \end{align*} Here, $\mathcal{I}(V)/\mathcal{I}(Y)$ is a prime ideal of the finitely generated $k$ algebra $k[x_1,\cdots ,x_n]/\mathcal{I}(Y)$ , which is also a domain as $V$ is a closed irreducible subset of $Y\cap H$ and hence of $X$ . $\underline{\text{Claim}}$ : ht $\mathcal{I}(V)/\mathcal{I}(Y)=1$ Proof: $k[x_1,\cdots ,x_n]/\mathcal{I}(Y)=B$ is a Noetherian integral domain. Let, $H=Z(g)$ and $Y=Z(f_1,\cdots ,f_k)$ . If $g\in\mathcal{I}(Y)$ then $H=Z(g)\supseteq Z(\mathcal{I}(Y))=\overline{Y}=Y$ , which is a contradiction to the given hypothesis. Hence, $g\notin\mathcal{I}(Y)$ . So, ( $\overline{0}\neq) \overline{g}$ is not a zero divisor in the integral domain $k[x_1,\cdots ,x_n]/\mathcal{I}(Y)$ . Now, $V\subseteq Z(g)$ which implies $\mathcal{I}(V)\supseteq\mathcal{I}(Z(g))=(g)$ . Hence, $g\in\mathcal{I}(V)$ . If $\overline{g}$ is a unit in $B$ , then $g-1\in\mathcal{I}(Y)\subseteq\mathcal{I}(V)$ . But, $g\in\mathcal{I}(V)$ which implies $1\in\mathcal{I}(V)$ and this is a contradiction. So, $\overline{g}$ is not a unit in $B$ . Now, we want to show that $\mathcal{I}(V)/\mathcal{I}(Y)$ is a minimal prime ideal containing $(\overline{g})$ . Any prime ideal in $B$ is of the form $\mathfrak p /\mathcal{I}(Y)$ where $\mathfrak p$ is a prime ideal in the polynomial ring containing $\mathcal{I}(Y)$ . Now Let, $\overline{g}\in\mathfrak p /\mathcal{I}(Y)$ where $\mathfrak p /\mathcal{I}(Y)\subseteq\mathcal{I}(V)/\mathcal{I}(Y)$ . Then, $g\in\mathfrak p\subseteq\mathcal{I}(V)$ . This implies, $Z(\mathfrak p)\supseteq Z(\mathcal{I}(V))=V$ . Now, $(g)\subseteq\mathfrak p$ and also $\mathcal{I}(Y)\subseteq \mathfrak p$ . Hence, $H=Z(g)\supseteq Z(\mathfrak p)$ and $Y=Z(\mathcal{I}(Y))\supseteq Z(\mathfrak p)$ . This implies, $Y\cap H\supseteq Z(\mathfrak p)$ . As $Z(\mathfrak p)$ is irreducible and $V$ is an irreducible component of $Y\cap H$ and $Z(\mathfrak p)\supseteq V$ , we have $Z(\mathfrak p)=V$ . This implies $\mathfrak p =\mathcal{I}(Z(\mathfrak p))=\mathcal{I}(V)$ . Hence, $\mathcal{I}(V)/\mathcal{I}(Y)$ is a minimal prime ideal containing $(\overline{g})$ . By Krull Hauptidealsatz ht $\mathcal{I}(V)/\mathcal{I}(Y)=1$ . So, we get $\dim V=r-1$ . Please check my proof.

Let $X$ and $Y$ be two varieties. Suppose there are points $P\in X$ and $Q\in Y$ such that the local rings $\mathcal{O}_{P,X}$ and $\mathcal{O}_{Q,Y}$ are isomorphic as $k$-algebras.

4,Two questions on homotopy sequence for étale fundamental groups,Two questions on homotopy sequence for étale fundamental groups,,"I have two questions regarding the homotopy exact sequence associated to étale fundamental groups. Firstly, let me set things up (I'm following Szamuely's book , namely Proposition 5.6.1 and Remark 5.6.3.2). Let $X$ be a quasi-compact, geometrically integral scheme over a field $k$ [we might as well assume, for relevance to my questions here, that $k$ is finitely generated over $\mathbb{Q}$]. Fix an algebraic closure $\bar{k}$ of $k$ [hence, under our additional assumption, $\bar{k}$ is also a separable closure $k_s$ of $k$] and let $\bar{X} = X_{\bar{k}}$ denote the base change of $X$ by $\text{Spec}(\bar{k})\to\text{Spec}(k)$. Let $\bar{x}:\text{Spec}(\bar{k})\to\bar{X}$ denote a geometric point of $\bar{X}$ and let  $$x : \text{Spec}(\bar{k})\xrightarrow{\bar{x}}\bar{X}\xrightarrow{p_X} X$$ be the geometric point of $X$ obtained from $\bar{x}$ via the natural morphism. The homotopy exact sequence of étale fundamental groups (with respect to these basepoints) is an exact sequence of étale fundamental groups $$1\to\pi_1 (\bar{X},\bar{x})\to\pi_1(X,x)\to \text{Gal}(\bar{k}/k)\to 1$$ where the homomorphisms between fundamental groups are induced by the natural maps $\bar{X}\to X\to\text{Spec}(k)$. 1) My first question concerns the proof of exactness of this sequence (specifically, exactness in the middle), although it is really just a geometrical question and not directly related to fundamental groups. In the proof of Proposition 5.6.1 Szamuely obtains two finite étale Galois covers $Y\to X$ and $X_L\to X$ (where $L/k$ is a finite Galois extension) having the same function field. Thus $X_L$ and $Y$ are isomorphic over the generic point of $X$, so there is a dense open $U\subseteq X$ so that $X_L \times_X U\cong Y\times_X U$. Szamuely then says that local freeness of the covers $Y\to X$, $X_L\to X$ (being étale) implies that $Y\cong X_L$ i.e. that this isomorphism extends over the whole of $X$. I don't understand how local freeness is used to obtain this isomorphism. Could somebody explain this? 2) My second question concerns the role of the basepoint in Remark 5.6.3.2, on the Section Conjecture. Recall any $k$-point of $X$ can be described as a section $$y: \text{Spec}(k)\to X$$ of the structural morphism $t:X\to\text{Spec}(k)$. A choice of algebraic closure then composes to give a geometric point $$\bar{y}:\text{Spec}(\bar{k})\to\text{Spec}(k)\to X.$$ Let $\sigma_y : \text{Gal}(\bar{k}/k) \to \pi_1 (X,\bar{y})$ denote the induced homomorphism on fundamental groups. Then $\sigma_y$ isn't quite a splitting of the homotopy sequence because $\pi_1 (X,\bar{y})$ and $\pi_1 (X,x)$ are, technically, different groups. However, they are isomorphic via $$\lambda : \pi_1 (X,\bar{y})\to\pi_1 (X,x)$$ which is unique up to conjugation by an element of $\pi_1 (X,x)$. Szamuely then claims that $\lambda \circ\sigma_y$ is a section of the homomorphism $t_*:\pi_1 (X,x)\to \text{Gal}(\bar{k}/k)$. I don't understand why this is the case and why $t_* \circ\lambda\circ\sigma_y$ is not an arbitrary automorphism of $\text{Gal}(\bar{k}/k)$. The question boils down to whether the isomorphism $\lambda$ induced by an étale path (an isomorphism of the fibre functors $F_{\bar{y}}\xrightarrow{\sim}F_x$) is compatible with the structural morphism $t:X\to\text{Spec}(k)$. i.e. let $t'_*:\pi_1 (X,\bar{y})\to \text{Gal}(\bar{k}/k)$ denote the induced homomorphism on fundamental groups with basepoint $\bar{y}$.

13,Some clarifications regarding the definition of the Hilbert-Mumford weight,Some clarifications regarding the definition of the Hilbert-Mumford weight,,"I am reading about the Hilbert-Mumford criterion and I am stuck at something that is stated as ""obvious"" in every text that I can find. A bit of help would be much appreciated. So, let $X$ be a projective variety over a field $k$, $G$ a reductive algebraic group acting on $X$ linearly, $\lambda : \mathbb{G}_m \rightarrow G$ a 1-parameter subgroup, and denote by $\lambda_x : \mathbb{G}_m \rightarrow X$ the map sending $t \mapsto \lambda(t)\cdot x$. Then this map extends to $\mathbb{P}^1$ (by the valuative criterion) - call the extended map $f$. Then Mumford denotes in his book the point $f(0)$ by $\lim_{t \rightarrow 0} \lambda(t)\cdot x$, and says that ""clearly"" it is fixed by the action of $\lambda(\mathbb{G}_m)$. I can understand this intuitively as follows: let $t,t' \in \mathbb{G}_m$ then $$\lambda(t) \cdot f(t') = \lambda(t)(\lambda(t') \cdot x) = \lambda(tt')\cdot x = f(tt')$$ Letting $t' \rightarrow 0$ we get that $f(0)$ is fixed, but I'd really like an algebraic proof for this. One can't just plug in $0$ into the above equations since $0 \not \in \mathbb{G}_m$ which is where I am stuck. Also, they proceed to say that $f(0)$ being fixed by the action of $\lambda(\mathbb{G}_m)$ implies that $\lambda(\mathbb{G}_m)$ acts on the fiber of the line bundle (associated to the sheaf) $\mathcal{O}_X(1)$ at $f(0)$ by a character $t \rightarrow t^r$ for some $r \in \mathbb{Z}$. What I know is that since the action on $X$ is linear the projection map from the line bundle is equivariant so we must have that the action is an automorphism of the fiber, but how is this a charater? Thanks.","I am reading about the Hilbert-Mumford criterion and I am stuck at something that is stated as ""obvious"" in every text that I can find. A bit of help would be much appreciated. So, let $X$ be a projective variety over a field $k$, $G$ a reductive algebraic group acting on $X$ linearly, $\lambda : \mathbb{G}_m \rightarrow G$ a 1-parameter subgroup, and denote by $\lambda_x : \mathbb{G}_m \rightarrow X$ the map sending $t \mapsto \lambda(t)\cdot x$. Then this map extends to $\mathbb{P}^1$ (by the valuative criterion) - call the extended map $f$. Then Mumford denotes in his book the point $f(0)$ by $\lim_{t \rightarrow 0} \lambda(t)\cdot x$, and says that ""clearly"" it is fixed by the action of $\lambda(\mathbb{G}_m)$. I can understand this intuitively as follows: let $t,t' \in \mathbb{G}_m$ then $$\lambda(t) \cdot f(t') = \lambda(t)(\lambda(t') \cdot x) = \lambda(tt')\cdot x = f(tt')$$ Letting $t' \rightarrow 0$ we get that $f(0)$ is fixed, but I'd really like an algebraic proof for this. One can't just plug in $0$ into the above equations since $0 \not \in \mathbb{G}_m$ which is where I am stuck. Also, they proceed to say that $f(0)$ being fixed by the action of $\lambda(\mathbb{G}_m)$ implies that $\lambda(\mathbb{G}_m)$ acts on the fiber of the line bundle (associated to the sheaf) $\mathcal{O}_X(1)$ at $f(0)$ by a character $t \rightarrow t^r$ for some $r \in \mathbb{Z}$.

(Also, the dimension of the largest component of the fiber containing is an upper semicontinuous function on X.) Are these related? For a finite type sheaf on a reduced scheme X, it looks like a vector bundle on each of the locally closed subsets given by for varying. So in this case my guess would be that there is a total space over for which is the sheaf of sections and the two theorems — in the case of a finite type reduced -scheme — are saying the same thing here. When is there a reasonable total space for a quasicoherent sheaf? (The étale space is not reasonable — it is way to big.) Are they both special cases of something more general?

I am just curious if one can make a connection in this way. I know that one can always extend when the map $i$ is replaced by an $k$-algebra isomorphism of the germ of functions at those points.  (This is exercise 4.7 in Hartshorne.) So in a way I am asking the following commutative algebra question: If $(R,M)$ and $(S,N)$ are local $k$-algebras admitting an $k$-linear isomorphism $N/N^2 \to M/M^2$, what is the obstruction to extending this to an isomorphism of $R$ to $S$?",,"['algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra']"

If $S = \text{Spec (K)}$ where $K$ is a local field, the usual way of doing a reduction at a prime $\mathfrak{p} = (\pi)$ is by reducing the defining equation of the elliptic curve modulo $\pi$ or, equivalently, by finding the Néron model of $E$, namely $\tilde{E} \rightarrow \text{Spec} (\mathcal{O}_K)$ and define $\tilde{E}_{\kappa(\mathfrak{p})} \rightarrow \text{Spec} (\kappa(\mathfrak{p}))$ as the reduction in the prime $\mathfrak{p}$.

The first part of the question asks to show that the map $c:Pic(X) \rightarrow H^1(X,\Omega_X)$ induced by $\mathcal{O}_X^* \rightarrow \Omega_X$, $f\rightarrow f^{-1}df$ is compatible with the pairings on $Pic(X)$ (intersection product) and $H^1(X,\Omega_X)$ (Serre duality). I'm not convinced that this is as trivial as certain online solutions make it out to be, but fine, I'm willing to accept that this is true by naturalness of Serre duality.

To be concrete, I am looking at the following elliptic surface given in Weierstrass normal form: $$y^2=x^3+x^2+t^3x+t^4$$ This surface has an $I_4$ fibre when $t=0$, according to Tate's algorithm, and I am trying to see this concretely. I feel like I understand how to do the first blow up: I cover the blow-up with two charts, the first of which is given by  $$t=t,y=y_1t, x=x_1t$$ Substituting these into the equation above, I find that $$t^2\left[y_1^2-tx_1^3-x_1^2-tx_1-t^2\right]=0$$ Thus, the strict transform of my surface is given by the equation in brackets, which is still singular. The $t=0$ fibre is the pair of lines $y_1=\pm x_1$ in this chart. This is what happens in another chart, if I use coordinates $$t=x''t'',y=y''x'', x=x''$$ The strict transform works out to $$y''^2=x''+1+x''^2t^3+t''^4x''^2$$ Analyzing the $t=t''x''=0$ fibre in this chart, we have two pieces: $$t''=0, y''^2=x''+1$$ $$x''=0,\ y''^2=1$$ If I check how these all glue, then the pair of lines that I found in the first chart becomes the pair of lines here, and a similar thing happens with the last chart. In summary, I am convinced that at this point, the $t=0$-fibre on my current surface is three rational curves, arranged in a triangle. At this point, I know what I need to do, but I don't think I'm doing it right. The surface I just obtained is still singular at the point $(x_1,y_1,t)=(0,0,0)$, so I need to blow it up. My intuition is that this will ""separate"" the two lines by introducing one more rational component meeting them each once. In total, this leaves 4 rational components arranged in a polygon, which is exactly what I should be getting. However, that is not what happens: I perform another blow-up by looking at the following chart: $$t=t, x_1=x_2t, y_1=y_2t$$ I find that the strict transform is  $$y_2^2=t^2x_2^3+x_2^2+x_2t+1$$ This is now smooth, and the $t=0$ fibre here is $$y_2^2=x_2^2+1,$$ which is a single rational component, as I had hoped. Now, the part that's not working is seeing how this component intersects the other three components that I found earlier. The pair of lines was given, in $(x_1,y_1,t)$ coordinates by $t=0,y_1=\pm x_1$. If I consider these equations in $(x_2,y_2,t)$ coordinates, I get $t=0, y_2=\pm x_2$. But neither of these lines intersect the rational component I found, so there's no way I can build an $I_4$ fibre from this!

I would greatly appreciate any help! Thanks in advance! For line bundles, being globally generated is the same as being basepoint free. The bundle $\mathscr{O}(-1)$ on $\mathbb{P}^n$ has no global sections which means that it must have a basepoint. But I am not sure how to go about finding this basepoint. Aren't the sections of $\mathscr{O}(-1)$ just degree -1 homogeneous elements of $\mathscr{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n}$? If so, on each open $U_{x_i}$, the sections are elements of the form $\frac{f}{x_i^n}$ where $f$ is a degree $n-1$ homogeneous element of $k[x_0,\dots,x_n]$. In this case, I don't see why all sections of $\mathscr{O}(-1)$ must vanish at the same point. (And what does it mean to be a basepoint of a line bundle that has no global sections? In Vakil's notes, a base point is defined to be where all sections vanish. To find a basepoint, does it suffice to check where all the global sections vanish?) I would like to compute the global sections of $\mathscr{O}(p+q)$ where $p=[0,1],q=[1,0]\in \mathbb{P}^1$ where $\mathbb{P}^1=$Proj$k[x,y]$. We can describe $p+q$ as the Cartier divisor $(U_x,y),(U_y,x)$ (I'm using Hartshorne's definition of a Cartier divisor). Then, the sections of the line bundle $\mathscr{O}(p+q)$ are: on $U_x$, elements of the form $\frac{1}{y}\frac{f}{x^n}$ where $f\in k[x,y]$ is homogeneous of degree $n$; on $U_y$, elements of the form $\frac{1}{x}\frac{f}{y^n}$ where $f\in k[x,y]$ is homogeneous of degree $n$. Then, global sections are $g\in k[x,y]$ such that $g=\frac{1}{x}\frac{f_1}{y^n}=\frac{1}{y}\frac{f_2}{x^n}$ for some $f_1,f_2\in k[x,y]$ degree $n$. This implies that global sections must be of the form $\frac{ax+by}{xy}$ which tells us that $h^0(\mathbb{P}^1,\mathscr{O}(p+q))=2$. I am a bit confused because I thought that by degree count, $\mathscr{O}(p+q)\cong \mathscr{O}(2)$ and so must have 3-dimensional global sections.

Then, the sections of the line bundle $\mathscr{O}(p+q)$ are: on $U_x$, elements of the form $\frac{1}{y}\frac{f}{x^n}$ where $f\in k[x,y]$ is homogeneous of degree $n$; on $U_y$, elements of the form $\frac{1}{x}\frac{f}{y^n}$ where $f\in k[x,y]$ is homogeneous of degree $n$. Then, global sections are $g\in k[x,y]$ such that $g=\frac{1}{x}\frac{f_1}{y^n}=\frac{1}{y}\frac{f_2}{x^n}$ for some $f_1,f_2\in k[x,y]$ degree $n$. This implies that global sections must be of the form $\frac{ax+by}{xy}$ which tells us that $h^0(\mathbb{P}^1,\mathscr{O}(p+q))=2$. I am a bit confused because I thought that by degree count, $\mathscr{O}(p+q)\cong \mathscr{O}(2)$ and so must have 3-dimensional global sections. Similarly I tried to compute $\mathscr{O}(p)$ where $p=[1,0]$ by describing $p$ as the Cartier divisor $(U_x,y),(U_y,y)$. This just gave me the trivial line bundle. I think the way I am describing/corresponding divisors to Cartier divisors might be incorrect but I haven't been able to figure out how.",,['algebraic-geometry']

90,Classifying extensions of a $k$-algebra,Classifying extensions of a -algebra,k,"Background . Let $k\to A$ be a finitely generated $k$-algebra, $I$ an $A$-module.

Let us write $A$ as a quotient of a polynomial algebra $P=k[x]$: $$0\to J\to P\to A\to 0.$$ The conormal sequence $J/J^2\to \Omega_{P/k}\otimes_PA\to \Omega_{A/k}\to 0$ induces a map  $$\alpha:\textrm{Hom}_A(\Omega_{P/k}\otimes_PA,I) \to \textrm{Hom}_A(J/J^2,I).$$ I am trying to prove the following: $$\color{blue}{\textrm{Ex}_k(A,I)\cong\textrm{coker } \alpha}.$$ We have thus fixed an extension $\eta$ as above. Now, as $P$ is a smooth $k$-algebra, the map $P\to A$ lifts to a map $g:P\to A'$ (this is the infinitesimal lifting property ). I think the main point here is: in how many ways? If $I$ has generators $\{e_i\}$ over $A$, and $y=\{y_i\}$ is a set of variables indexed like the $e_i$'s, $g$ induces exactly one morphism $$Q:=P\otimes k[y]\to A'$$ compatible with $g$. I want to show that moving in the isomorphism class of $\eta$ is the same as moving in the set of possible liftings $P\to A'$ or, which is the same, in the set of possible morphisms $Q\to A'$. There is only one thing I know, and I am unable to use it. What I know is that if I have two liftings $g,g'$, their difference $g-g':P\to I$ is an element of $\textrm{Der}_k(P,I)$. Conversely, the sum of a lifting and a such derivation is a new lifting. Moreover, I was able to show that $$\textrm{Hom}_A(\Omega_{P/k}\otimes_PA,I)\cong\textrm{Hom}_P(\Omega_{P/k},I)\cong\textrm{Der}_k(P,I).$$ So I can view $\alpha$ as a morphism $\textrm{Der}_k(P,I)\to \textrm{Hom}_A(J/J^2,I)$.
