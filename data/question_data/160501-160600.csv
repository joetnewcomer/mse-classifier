EDIT: One way to go the other way would be to argue that any set in $\sigma(C)$ must be built by repeatedly applying the complement, union and intersection operations to elements of $C$ and all these operations are preserved when taking the inverse.

This will probably require the axiom of choice. Does anyone have a suggestion? Edit: I forgot to mention that the set has to be in $[0,1]$ which seemed ""clear"" in my head, but which obviously isn't. Edit 2: Now it is clear that I just need a non-measurable set with outer measure 1, from that I can make any other one. I have once seen somewhere that they do this with transfinite recursion (if I recall correctly), but I don't remember where and how because I didn't know that transfinite recursion was back then.","Is it possible to construct a non-measurable set in $[0,1]$ of a given outer measure $x \in [0,1]$?

What are the usual ways to define a sigma algebra on their Cartesian product? There is one way in the context of defining product measure on planetmath . Let $(E_i, B_i)$ be measurable spaces, where $i \in I$ is an index set, possibly infinite. We define their product as follows: let $E= \prod_{i \in I} E_i$ , the    Cartesian product of $E_i$ , let $B=\sigma((B_i)i \in I)$ , the    smallest sigma algebra containing    subsets of $E$ of the form $\prod_{i    \in I}B_i$ where $B_i=E_i$ for all    but a finite number of $i \in I$ .
