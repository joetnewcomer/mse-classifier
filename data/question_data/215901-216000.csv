2,Locking on a uniformly linearly moving object by rotating the aim from above,Locking on a uniformly linearly moving object by rotating the aim from above,,"Setting . Suppose we have a scene and a spotlight above it that can be turned onto any object on the scene. On the scene we have an object that moves uniformly and linearly. We are given the angular velocity of the spotlight, the speed of the object and initial positions of both. The question is what is the minimal amount of time before we can put the object in the center of the light spot, and at what angle the spotlight should be moved? Mathmatical formulation . Given . Let consider 3d space with Cartesian coordinate system so that the object moves on the plane $xOy$ parallel to the $x$-axis, spotlight is hang at the point $(0,0,h)$ and shines onto $(x_1,y_1,0)$, i.e. onto  $(x_1,y_1)$ on the plane $xOy$. The spotlight angular velocity is $\varphi$. The object initially starts at the point $(x_2,y_2)$ and moves at the speed $v$, so the velocity vector is $(v, 0)$ (or globally $(v, 0, 0)$). To find . The minimal amount of time $t$ before we can put the object in the center of the light spot is the unknown. By that time the object will reach the position $(x_2+t\cdot v, y_2)$, so the spotlight would have to move directly from  $(x_1,y_1)$ onto $(x_2+t\cdot v, y_2)$ by turning through an angle $\beta$, which is the angle between vectors $(x_1,y_1,-h)$ and $(x_2+t\cdot v, y_2, -h)$. Equation . The above gives us the following equation: $$ \frac{\beta}{\varphi} = t, $$ where $\beta$, as was defined before, is the angle between vectors $(x_1,y_1,-h)$ and $(x_2+t\cdot v, y_2,-h)$. Using the formula for cosine between two vectors —  $\cos{\beta}=\frac{\overline{a}\cdot \overline{b}}{|\overline{a}|\cdot|\overline{b}|}$ —  we get: $$ \frac{1}{\varphi}\cos^{-1}\frac{x_1(x_2+t\cdot v)+y_1\cdot y_2 + h^2}{\sqrt{\left(x_1^2+y_1^2+h^2\right)\left((x_2+tv)^2+y_2^2+h^2\right)}} = t, $$ This is too hardcore to my taste and I have no idea how to solve it.

Find the angle made by the sloping edges with the horizontal* The answer they're looking for is $35.26$ degrees. I believe that this angle is $AQC$ where $C$ is the point directly below $A$. In order to find this the hypotenuse length $AQ$ is needed and either the height $CA$ or width $QC$. I've started by finding the sloping lengths of the middle of each face, because there's a $45$ degree angle the height/width will be the same so I tried substituting in $1$ resulting in a sloping length of $2$. Using the width / face slope I tried calculating $AQ$ by creating a new triangle halving the $PAQ$ face with a height of $2$ and width of $1$ which gives $AQ$ as $2.2$. The length $QC$ comes out as $2$ using Pythagoras. These values for the triangle $ACQ$ give me an angle of $24.6$ degrees which is incorrect.

Prove there is a subset $T$ of $S$ with at least $\dfrac{n}{7}$ points such that any two points   of $T$ are at least $\sqrt{3}$ units apart.

The $|T| = 2$ case can be proven for $n=8$ (possibly for $n=7$ if you sharpen the half-plane restriction). For any set of points in the plane, there is at least one point on the convex hull of this set. Let this point be $P$. Then all other points must be weakly within (possibly on the boundary) a half-plane through this point. So if we imagine other points in a fan arrangement around $P$, the total fan angle must be $\le 180^\circ$.

The first two terms always sum to at least $1$ (by AM-GM) and the last term can be minimised by taking $|Q_{i-1}Q_i|=1,\:|PQ_{i-1}|=|PQ_i|=\sqrt{3}$.

Bringing everything to the right side: $$\sin x+{\sqrt{3}}\cos x=0$$ Now we notice terms ${\sqrt{3}}$ with $\cos x$ and $1$ with $\sin x$ and do the following: \begin{align*} \sin x+{\sqrt{3}}\cos x& =0 \quad /:2\\  \frac{1}{2}\sin x+{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}\cos x& = 0 \end{align*} Now, the goal is to try and substitute integer terms with trigonometric functions they are solutions to, in order to apply one of the trigonometric identities for solving the problem. Let's aim at the following formula: $\sin(x+y)=\sin x\cos y + \sin y\cos x$ .We have several options: $\frac {1}{2} $is value of $\cos$ for either $x=\frac {\pi}{3} + 2k\pi$ OR $x=\frac {5\pi}{3} + 2k\pi$.

Out of all of these angles, there are two of them that fall under our domain. $x=\frac {\pi}{3}$ and $x=\frac {2\pi}{3}$. This is where the problem is. I feel I should consider both of the $\sin$ values and solve two different versions of the equation. The first one is by substituting $\frac {1}{2} = \cos\frac {\pi}{3}$ and $\frac {\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sin\frac {\pi}{3}$, which is easily solved using the identity mentioned above. The second case is when substituting $\frac {\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sin\frac {2\pi}{3}$. This does not conform to any trig. identity.

It turns out that at some point they divided the equation with $\cos x$. Even when $\cos x$ is definitely not zero, I was taught dividing a trigonometric equation with anyting other than integers was a risky move very likely to result in a loss of solutions.

Analogous Formula Generalizing Cosine to Higher Dimensions?,,"So I was day dreaming about linear algebra today (in a class which had nothing to do with linear algebra), when I stumbled across an interesting relationship. I was thinking about how determinants are really the area spanned by column vectors, and I had the thought that one could measure linear independence (in $R^2$ in this case) on a scale from 0 to 1 by taking the ratio $\frac{|det(\vec{a},\vec{b})|}{|\vec{a}||\vec{b}|}$ where $det(\vec{a},\vec{b})$ is the determinant of a matrix whose column vectors are $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$. Then I remembered the definition of the cross product in $R^2$,  $\vec{a}\times\vec{b}= \begin{vmatrix}i&j&k\\a_1&a_2&0\\b_1&b_2&0 \end{vmatrix} = \begin{vmatrix}a_1&a_2\\b_1&b_2\end{vmatrix}k = det(\vec{a},\vec{b}) k$ . Taking the absolute value, we have $|\vec{a}\times\vec{b}| = |\vec{a}||\vec{b}|sin(\theta) = |det(\vec{a},\vec{b})|$. Finally, rearranging we have $sin(\theta) = \frac{|det(\vec{a},\vec{b})|}{|\vec{a}||\vec{b}|}$. This can be thought of as comparing actual area spanned to maximum possible area spanned. With this definition, we can generalize this notion of measuring linear independence to higher dimensions (e.g. for $R^3$, $sin(\theta) = \frac{|det(\vec{a},\vec{b},\vec{c})|}{|\vec{a}||\vec{b}||\vec{c}|}$). Now clearly this isn't ""really"" $sin(\theta)$, but the notion should be the same, i.e. comparing actual spanned volume to maximum possible spanned volume. Finally we note that $|det(\vec{a},\vec{b},\vec{c})|$ may also be written as $|\vec{a}\wedge\vec{b}\wedge\vec{c}|$, allowing us to write $sin(\theta) = \frac{|\vec{a}\wedge\vec{b}\wedge\vec{c}|}{|\vec{a}||\vec{b}||\vec{c}|}$.

The difference is, we have no problem generalizing the equation for sine to an arbitrary amount of dimensions. We simply need to tack on another wedge product, i.e. $sin(\theta) = \frac{|\vec{v_1}\wedge\vec{v_2}\cdots\wedge\vec{v_n}|}{|\vec{v_1}||\vec{v_2}|\cdots|\vec{v_n}|}$. My question is: Is there a similar way to generalize cosine using a simple combination of products in the numerator? Perhaps in geometric algebra? Maybe it would somehow extend the analogy of cosine being the ratio of actual projection to maximum possible projection? Thanks in advance! Edit: To anyone who is interested, I figured out since the denominator of the cosine generalization would be $|\vec{v}|^3$ for 3 vectors $\vec{v}$ that are all in the same direction. Therefore, the numerator would need to equal  $|\vec{v}|^3$ to yield an answer of 1 in the case that all the vectors are parallel.","So I was day dreaming about linear algebra today (in a class which had nothing to do with linear algebra), when I stumbled across an interesting relationship.

84,Geometry question: ray paths and circles,Geometry question: ray paths and circles,,"I was working on a problem and used the image below to make an argument regarding an effective line-of-sight (from one of my papers).  My question below is more of an intellectual curiosity since the paper was already published (I am a physicist, so if my mathematical lingo is sloppy, I will entertain criticism if witty). Suppose one moved along either of the red arrows (or equally the obstacle moved over you) at a velocity $\mathbf{V}_{o}$, then we could say that $L_{s}$ = $\lvert \mathbf{V}_{o} \rvert t$.  Using some simple geometric rules, we can also show that: $$ L_{s} = 2 \left( a^{2} - b^{2} \right)^{1/2} $$ where $a$ is the radius of the circle and $b$ is the impact parameter (see figure).  I was also able to find an analytic solution for $L_{a}$ = $L_{a}\left( L_{s},a,\theta \right)$ for the top trajectory, given by: $$ L_{a} = -\frac{ L_{s} }{ 2 } \pm \frac{ \left\{ \left[ 2 \ a \ \cos \theta + \sqrt{4 \ a^{2} - L_{s}^{2} } \right]^{2} + L_{s}^{2} \sin^{2} \theta \right\}^{1/2} }{ 2 \sin \theta } $$ This is the length of the trajectory over which one would be in the effective ""shadow"" of this obstacle (don't worry about what SLAMS stands for… unless you are interested in nonlinear solitons). However, this solution only works for the top trajectory.  Therefore, I have two questions: Is there an analytic solution for the lower trajectory? If so, how would I go about finding it [I used power of point etc. for the top part but couldn't convince myself it would work for the bottom part]? Edits In the figure below, you see two red arrows.  These correspond to two possible trajectories through the obstacle.  One could imagine sitting still while the obstacle moved over you at a velocity $\mathbf{V}_{o}$ (or you move through the obstacle at that velocity, it doesn't matter).  Therefore, $L_{s}$ is the distance traversed while inside the obstacle. The distance $L_{a}$ shown in blue is the distance between the point of exit from the obstacle to the point where the green arrows no longer intersect with the obstacle.  Meaning, $L_{a}$ defines the distance along the red arrow one must traverse before one can observe something along a green arrow line of sight that does not intersect the obstacle. In the current figure, the $L_{a}$ is only shown for the top trajectory.  The corresponding $L_{a}$ for the bottom trajectory with this specific $\theta$ and $b$ would be very short (actually, just to the right of the blue vertical dashed line is where it would end and just to the left is where it would start).","I was working on a problem and used the image below to make an argument regarding an effective line-of-sight (from one of my papers).

Most of the time, I just keep transforming the equations aimlessly until I stumble upon the conclusion. I would prefer a solution with the motivation behind it, and also, if possible, some general tips on approaching such problems.",,"['algebra-precalculus', 'trigonometry']"

96,Is there an upper bound on the number of distinct integer outputs a trig function can have?,Is there an upper bound on the number of distinct integer outputs a trig function can have?,,"""Usually"" when you plug integers into trig functions you don't get integers as output. I'm interested in trig functions that pass through integer lattice points. Let $f$ be a linear combination of sine and cosine functions. We want to plug integers into $f$ and get integers in return. Here are some examples: $5\cos \left(\frac{2\pi x}{3}\right)+\frac{9}{\sqrt{3}}\sin \left(\frac{2\pi x}{3}\right)$ cycles through the outputs 5, 2, and -7. $5\cos \left(\frac{\pi x}{2}\right)+2\sin \left(\frac{\pi x}{2}\right)$ cycles through the outputs 5, 2, -5, and -2. $5\cos \left(\frac{\pi x}{3}\right)-\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\sin \left(\frac{\pi x}{3}\right)$ cycles through the outputs 5, 2, -3, -5, -2, and 3. These examples demonstrate that we can get three, four, and six distinct integer outputs. I'm wondering if we can achieve more than that, particularly if we can produce arbitrarily many distinct integer outputs. Here the sine and cosine functions have the same period, but that does not have to be the case. These integer outputs also came from consecutive integer inputs, but that also does not have to be so.
