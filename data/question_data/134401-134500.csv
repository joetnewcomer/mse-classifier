In other   words, if the orders are the same, why should students learn these two   methods? Let us keep the order of accuracy at 2 for both of these methods. Just to be clear, I will write out these well known formulas. Though there are many, let us take a look at Heun's Runge-Kutta method of order 2 (RK2): $$y_{k+1} = y_k + \frac{h}{2}[f(t_k, y_k) + f(t_k + h, y_k + hf(t_k,y_k))]$$ and compare it with the second order Adam Bashforth method (AB2): $$y_{k+2} = y_{k+1}+\frac{3h}{2}f(t_{k+1}, y_{k+1})-\frac{h}{2}f(t_k,y_k)$$ Here's my understanding of their differences: They look different. RK2 is from Taylor series approximation, AB2 is from the quadrature's polynomial interpolation. AB2 is unique, while there are infinitely many formulas for RK2 (though only one of them has the lowest local error). RK2 is single step, AB2 is two-step. Both have their respective implicit versions of all orders, which can be used to perform PECE. I see all these differences, yet still do not understand when one should prefer one over the other. I feel like I have the details, but I am missing out on the big picture.","I do not quite understand the essential difference between these   methods.

9,Describe the movement of a string-pendulum with initial speed $v_0=2\sqrt{gL}$,Describe the movement of a string-pendulum with initial speed,v_0=2\sqrt{gL},"I posted this question here (physics.stackexchange) a few days ago, but our fellow physicians did not seem to like the question. I am giving it another try among the community of mathematicians! The question was asked in a written test years ago, in a post graduate course. Therefore I assume it is possible to answer without the help of a computer. Nevertheless, all approaches are welcome. The question is quite straightforward, it's all in the title. Suppose you have a classical pendulum of mass $m$, linked to the frictionless pivot by a weightless string (not the classical rod) of length $L$. The pendulum is initially in vertical position, in its equilibrium position. If you put it in motion with a horizontal speed $v_0=2 \sqrt{gL}$, what happens ? How can the movement be described? I know for a fact (from a simulation) that I need to find the equations of the trajectory in the picture below. That is, the trajectory is circular (in red) up to a certain height, after which it becomes parabolic (in blue). Approach #1: I know the equation describing the movement of a pendulum is  $$ \frac{d^2 \theta}{d t^2} + \frac{g}{L}\sin \theta = 0, $$ where $\theta$ is the amplitude of the pendulum. So I suppose one could solve the differential equation numerically with the initial conditions $$\theta(0)=0,\quad \frac{d \theta}{d t}(0) = \frac{2 \sqrt{gL}}{L}=2 \sqrt{\frac{g}{L}}$$ and find an approximate solution. However, there is no closed form possible, and this was probably not the expected approach in the written exam. This being said, I am interested in knowing if the approach is correct from a theoretical point of view. Approach #2: It is not very difficult to show that the tension of the string is given by $$ T(\theta) = mg \cos \theta + m L \left(\frac{d \theta}{dt}\right)^2 $$ where again, $\theta$ is the amplitude from the vertical position. Or in terms of $h$, the height of the pendulum (assuming $h=0$ in the initial position): $$ T(h) = mg \frac{h-L}{L}+ 4mg(1-\frac{h}{2L}) $$ The string becomes slack when $T(h)=0$, i.e., when $ h = \frac{5L}{3}$. At this point, the pendulum is only submitted to its weight, and the trajectory becomes parabolic. Would this be correct? How can we find the height at which the pendulum's trajectory becomes circular again (the bottom left part of the red trajectory in the picture). Any input is welcome.

35,2nd order nonlinear ODE,2nd order nonlinear ODE,,"I have to solve the following ODE $$   \frac{y''}{y'^2} + y'e^y = 0 $$ by finding a function $F(y',y)$ such that its derivative is equal to $\frac{y''}{y'^2} + y'e^y$ , then using initial conditions $y(0) = 0$ and $y'(0) = 1$ . What I have done so far is this. Using the multivariable chain rule we can deduce the following: $$   \frac{d}{dx} \left(F(y',y)\right) = \underbrace{\frac{d}{dx} y'(x)}_{=y''} \cdot \frac{\partial F(y',y)}{\partial y'} + \underbrace{\frac{d}{dx} y(x)}_{=y'} \cdot \frac{\partial F(y',y)}{\partial y} $$ So by simple comparison we need that $\frac{\partial F(y',y)}{\partial y'} = \frac{1}{y'^2}$ and $\frac{\partial F(y',y)}{\partial y} = e^y$ . Then by integrating both of these equations with respect to either variable $y'$ and $y$ we get $$ \begin{align*}   &F(y',y) = \int e^y \, dy = e^y + c(y') \\   &F(y',y) = \int \frac{1}{y'^2} \, dy' = -\frac{1}{y'} + c(y) \end{align*} $$ Thus an appropriate function would be $F(y',y) = e^y - \frac{1}{y'} + C$ . So we have the relationship $$   \frac{d}{dx} \left(e^y - \frac{1}{y'} + c\right) = 0 $$ Integrating both sides yields $$   e^y - \frac{1}{y'} + c_1 = c_2 $$ Now if $c_1$ and $c_2$ were zero (or identical), this would be easy to solve using separation but as this is nonlinear and inhomogeneous, I have no idea.","I have to solve the following ODE by finding a function such that its derivative is equal to , then using initial conditions and .

99,Showing that $\ddot{x}=x-x^3$ is a conservative system,Showing that  is a conservative system,\ddot{x}=x-x^3,"I am aware that there are multiple ways of showing that the  system $\,\ddot{x}=x-x^3$ is Conservative. One of which is applying Newton's law from physics $$\frac{dE(t)}{dt}=\frac{d}{dt}\left[\frac12m\dot{x}^2+V(x)\right]=0$$ where, in this case, $$-\frac{dV(x)}{dx}=x-x^3\quad\text{and}\quad m=1.$$ However, I was wondering why the following method would not work. For a consertive system the curl is $0$ (assuming the domain of definition is simply connected), in other words, $\nabla\times\boldsymbol{F}=\boldsymbol{0}.$ The given differential equation can be written as $$\begin{cases} \dot{x(t)}=y(t) \\ \dot{y(t)}=x(t)-x^3(t)\end{cases}$$ where $\boldsymbol{F}=y\hat{i}+(x-x^3)\hat{j}.$ But $\nabla\times\boldsymbol{F}=-3x^2\hat{k}\neq\boldsymbol{0}.$ What is wrong with this reasoning?","I am aware that there are multiple ways of showing that the  system is Conservative.
