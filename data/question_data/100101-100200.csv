1,What hyperbolic space *really* looks like,What hyperbolic space *really* looks like,,"There are several models of hyperbolic space that are embedded in Euclidean space . For example, the following image depicts the Beltrami-Klein model of a hyperbolic plane: where geodesics are represented by straight lines.

3,Kissing number for equal ellipses on the plane,Kissing number for equal ellipses on the plane,,"It's quite easy to determine maximum kissing number for circles (disks) on a plane. Since we have circumference $C=2 \pi r$, we just take the integer part of $2\pi$, which is $6$. However, for ellipses the problem seems to be much more complicated. To get maximum kissing number we need to arrange the ellipses on 'pointy ends' around the central ellipse. Obviously, for large $a/b$ ratio, the kissing number will be large as well, approaching infinity when the ellipse becomes a line segment. This is how (awkwardly) the packing is supposed to look: The only approximation I could think of is to us the length of an ellipse formula, imagining the centers of surrounding ellipses lying on another ellipse. Let $a,b$ be the major and minor axes (radii) of the ellipses we are packing.

4,"What's the area of the triangle in this geometry problem? I think I can solve it, but it's way too convoluted...","What's the area of the triangle in this geometry problem? I think I can solve it, but it's way too convoluted...",,"I am trying to solve this geometry problem from an exam. The exam is supposed to be 3 hours long,  and this is supposed to be 1 out of 10 problems. So given that, the solution should be something quick. However, the only solution I've been able to find is extremely convoluted and realistically I'd never be able to give an answer in less than 3 hours. So, I'm looking for a simpler solution ( the intended solution ) which I should have been able to do in the exam. Here's the problem: Consider this illustration: In the image, the outer shape is a square with side length $8$ , a circle is drawn so that is is tangent to two sides of the square at points $G$ and $F$ , then the line $AH$ is drawn so that it is tangent to the circle at point $I$ and also such that the length of the segment $AI$ is also equal to $8$ . Lastly the line $BJ$ is drawn such that it is tangent to the circle at point $K$ . Find the area of the blue triangle, that is the area of $\triangle{AJB}$ . My approach so far is to divide the square into 9 different areas : I also added the segment $EL$ such that it is the continuation of the line $GE$ . From here on out when I say $a_{i}$ , I am referring to the area of region $a_{i}$ , $r$ will be the radius of the circle, $x$ will be the length of segment $JI$ and $y$ will be the length of segment $IH$ . So we want to find $a_{9}$ Notice then that: $$ a_{1} = a_{2} = \frac{r(8-r)}{2} \\ a_{3} = r^2 \\ a_{4} = a_{5} = \frac{ry}{2} \\ a_{6} = a_{7} = \frac{rx}{2} \\ a_{8} = \frac{8(8-r-y)}{2} =  4(8-r-y) \\ a_{1} + \cdots + a_{9} = 8*8 = 64 \\ a_{1} + \cdots + a_{8} = 4r + ry + rx + 32 - 4y = 32 + r(4 + x) + y(r - 4) \\ a_{9} = 64 - (32 + r(4 + x) + y(r - 4)) = 32 - r(4 + x) + y(4 - r) $$ So from here really all we need to do is find $x, y, r$ and problem solved, right? Finding $r$ is pretty easy, notice that line segment $AE$ can be thought of as the hypotenuse of $\triangle{AIE}$ and the hypotenuse of $\triangle{AEL}$ . Using Pythagoras, we have $8^2 + r^2 = (8-r)^2 + (8-r)^2$ . Solving for $r$ we get two solutions: $16+8\sqrt{3}, 16-8\sqrt{3}$ and since $r$ is lesser than $8$ , then the second one is our value of $r$ . To find the value of $y$ , notice that by Pythagoras on $\triangle{ACH}$ , we have: $(8 + y)^2 = 8^2 + (8-r-y)^2$ , and since we know the value of $r$ we can solve for $y$ and we get $y = \frac{16\sqrt{3}-24}{3}$ . From here, I don't actually know how to find the value of $x$ , so I went back to our expression for the desired area $a_{9} = 32 - r(4 + x) + y(4 - r)$ , plugged in the values of $r$ and $y$ to make the area a function of $x$ , then I found another function of $x$ for the area, using Heron's formula. Notice the perimeter of the desired triangle is equal to $8 + (8 - x) + (8 - r + x)$ , and when we plugged for $r$ we get that the semiperimeter $S$ should be equal to $S = 4 \sqrt{3} + 4$ . Since the sides of the triangle have length $8, 8-x, 8-r+x$ and since we have precise values for the semiperimeter and $r$ , we can sort of make a function for the area based on values of $x$ . If we make these two functions equal to each other and solve the equation, we get two values which are possible candidates for $x$ . Problem is, these values are super convoluted, involve really large numbers and a bunch of radical expressions, which is why I gave up on this solution, realistically if it wasn't for Symbolab solving the equation for me, I probably wouldn't have time to do so in the exam. So that's why I am writing this post : I would like for you guys to help me come up with a concrete value for $x$ in an easier way, or maybe a completely different way of computing the area that doesn't involve $x$ , anything that is simpler than what I've been doing.

5,Do side-rational triangles of the same area admit side-rational dissections?,Do side-rational triangles of the same area admit side-rational dissections?,,"Call a polygon side-rational if the lengths of all its sides are rational.  Call a dissection of a polygon side-rational if all of the polygons within the dissection are side-rational.  Then my question is as in the title: Do any two rational triangles of the same area have a common side-rational dissection? Of course it's a classical result that any two polygons of the same area have a common dissection; a standard proof goes through triangulating the polygons, using a triangle-to-rectangle dissection, partitioning the rectangles for both polygons into a set of common-area rectangles, and then using a rectangle-to-rectangle dissection.  But many of the steps in this process will involve non-rational sides (for instance, the rectangle corresponding to a triangle of rational sides but irrational area certainly can't have rational sides), and it's not clear that such a dissection could be patched up. This question was prompted by rediscovering my common dissection of two very special rational triangles, the $4-5-6$ triangle and the $3-8-10$ triangle (both of area $\frac{15}{4}\sqrt{7}$): All the lengths here can be shown straightforwardly with the law of sines and law of cosines; these triangles are a somewhat special case because so many of the angles involved are multiples of each other, but it seems likely that any rational triangle will inherently be special in somewhat similar ways. EDIT : the original version of this question asked about arbitrary polygons, but having thought about it more I would be amazed if that result is true.  The area of a (side-)rational triangle is always the square root of a rational number (by Heron's formula , for instance), but already rational-sided quadrilaterals can have arbitrary area: just imagine 'flexing' a rhombus with all sides of unit length, from a square down to a trivial, collapsed shape: it will continuously take on all areas from $1$ to $0$.  This implies, for instance, that there's a rhombus with all sides of unit length and area $\frac\pi4$; such a rhombus can't be dissected into rational triangles, and it's hard to imagine any shared dissection it would have with, e.g., the rhombus with all sides of length $2$ and area $\frac\pi4$.  (Which admittedly isn't a proof that one doesn't exist!) A fair bit of rummaging around the web has turned up nothing on the topic; if anyone has pointers to similar matters, they'd be very much appreciated.","Call a polygon side-rational if the lengths of all its sides are rational.

10,"Is a closed set with the ""unique nearest point"" property convex?","Is a closed set with the ""unique nearest point"" property convex?",,"A friend of mind had a question that I couldn't answer. It is well-known that if $K$ is a closed, convex subset of a Hilbert space $H$ (say over the reals) then, for any point $p \in H$ , there exists a unique point $p'$ in $K$ closest to $p$ . We would like to know whether the following converse is true. If $K \subset H$ is a closed subset such that, for all points $p \in H$ , there exists a unique point $p' \in K$ closest to $p$ , does it follows that $K$ is convex? I'm not sure what the answer is - even when $H$ is the plane! OK, I found some time to read/understand the document that Michael Biro linked below, so I thought I would add a summary. In what follows, $K$ is a subset of the finite-dimensional Hilbert space $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that, for all $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ , there is a unique $P(x) \in K$ as close as possible to $x$ . That is, $P(x)$ is the only point in $K$ with $\| x-P(x)\| = \mathrm{dist}(x,K)$ . In particular, $\mathrm{dist}(x,K)$ is positive when $x \notin K$ , so $K$ is clearly closed. Another easy observation is given below. Lemma 0. For $x,y\in \mathbb R^n,\, |d(y,K)-d(x,K)|\le \|y-x\|$ . Proof : For any $z\in K$ , $$d(y,K)\le \|y-z\|\le \|y-x\|+\|x-z\|.$$ Taking the infimum over $z\in K$ both sides of the inequality, we have $$d(y,K)\le \|y-x\|+d(x,K).$$ By the symmetry between $x$ and $y$ , we obtain the lemma. Lemma 1. If $x \in \mathbb{R}^n \setminus K$ , then $P(y) = P(x)$ for all $y$ on the line segment joining $x$ to $P(x)$ . Proof. We have $$ \|x - P(y)\| \leq \|x - y\| + \|y - P(y)\| \leq \|x-y\| + \|y-P(x)\| = \|x - P(x)\|$$ whence $P(y) = P(x)$ . The final equality above uses the assumption that $y$ is on the line segment joining $x$ to $P(x)$ . It is reasonable to expect Lemma 1 to hold when $y$ is merely on the ray extending from $P(x)$ through $x$ . This is true, but far less simple to prove. In fact, the proof seems to need the Brouwer fixed point theorem. To apply Brouwer, we shall need continuity of the projection. Lemma 2. $P$ is continuous. Proof. Suppose $x_n \to x$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ . We want to show $P(x_n) \to P(x)$ . $P(x_n)$ are bounded by the triangular inequality and Lemma 0. Use the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem to reduce proving $P(x_n) \to P(x)$ to proving $P(x_{n_k}) \to P(x)$ for every subsequence such that $P(x_{n_k})$ converges. If $P(x_{n_k}) \to y \in K$ , then $$ \|x-y\| = \lim_{k \to \infty} \|x_{n_k} - P(x_{n_k})\| = \lim_{k \to \infty} \mathrm{dist}(x_{n_k}, S) = \mathrm{dist}(x,K)$$ which implies $y=P(x)$ . We now use the Brouwer fixed point theorem to improve Lemma 1. Lemma  3. If $x \in \mathbb{R}^n \setminus K$ , then $P(y) = P(x)$ for all $y$ on the ray extending from $P(x)$ through $x$ . Proof. Suppose the whole ray does not project to $P(x)$ . Using Lemmas 1 & 2, argue that $x$ can be moved out along the ray until everything on the closed segment from $P(x)$ to $x$ projects to $P(x)$ , but everything further out on the ray does not project to $P(x)$ . Let $B$ be a closed ball centred on $x$ disjoint from $K$ . Define a map $\Phi : B \to \partial B$ by sending $y \in B$ to the unique point $\Phi(y) \in \partial B$ such that $x$ is on the segment joining $P(y)$ to $\Phi(y)$ . It is easy to derive an explicit formula and continuity of $\Phi$ follows from Lemma 2. By Brouwer, $\Phi$ has a fixed point. It turns out there can only be one fixed point and we will say exactly what it is. Suppose that $y$ is a fixed point of $\Phi$ . Then $x$ is on the segment from $P(y)$ to $y=\Phi(y)$ so $P(y) = P(x)$ by Lemma 1. But, this determines $y$ uniquely to be the point on $\partial B$ antipodal to $P(x)$ . But, now we have a contradiction since this $y$ is beyond $x$ on the ray from $P(x)$ through $x$ and should therefore have $P(y) \neq P(x)$ by assumption. With Lemma 3 out of the way, it is easy to prove Motzkin's theorem using the idea in Rahul's comment below. Motzkin's Theorem. Every subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ with the ""unique nearest point property"" is convex. Proof. Suppose that $x \in \mathbb{R}^n \setminus K$ . By Lemma 3, for any point $y$ on the ray from $P(x)$ through $x$ , we have $P(x) = P(y)$ so that the open ball $B_y$ centred on $y$ with $P(x)$ on the boundary is disjoint from $K$ . As $y$ becomes unbounded, we see that $K$ is separated from $x$ by the half-plane through $P(x)$ with normal vector $x-P(x)$ . Obviously this precludes the possibility that $x$ is a convex combination of two points in $K$ .","A friend of mind had a question that I couldn't answer.

11,Finding an invisible circle by drawing another line,Finding an invisible circle by drawing another line,,"A friend of mine taught me the following question. He said he found it in a book a few years ago. Though I've tried to solve it, I'm facing difficulty. Question : You know on a plane there is an invisible circle whose radius is less than or equals $1$. Fortunately, you have already found that the lengths of the chords of a circle by two lines $l_1, l_2$ are $d_1, d_2$ $(2\gt d_1\ge d_2\gt0)\ $respectively. By drawing another line, let's find this circle. If the line you'll draw crosses a circle at two points, then you'll get the length of the chord of a circle by the line. If the line you'll draw and a circle come in contact with each other, then you'll get the coordinates of the point of contact instead of getting $0$ as the length of the chord. If the line you'll draw neither crosses nor comes in contact with any circle, then you'll be able to draw another line just once more. Find the coordinates of the center of a circle. This is all the question says. Could you give me how to find the coordinates? The situation so far : The $l_1\parallel l_2$ case : This case has been already solved (see Blue's answer below). The $l_1\not \parallel l_2$ case : This case has not been solved yet. Supposing that   $l_1:y=x\tanθ$, $l_2:y=-x\tanθ$ and $l_3:y=0$ ($l_4:x=0$ if needed) for $0<θ<\pi/2$, then we can get two possible coordinates as the center of a circle. However, it seems difficult to decide just one coodinates because each line is symmetric about the origin. Hence, a new line, which is not $y=0$, is needed as $l_3$. My approach : Let each of $l_{1,d+}, l_{1,d-}, l_{2,D+}, l_{2,D-}$ be the followings:$$l_{1,d+}:y=x\tanθ+\frac{d}{\cosθ}, l_{1,d-}:y=x\tanθ-\frac{d}{\cosθ}$$ $$l_{2,D+}:y=-x\tanθ+\frac{D}{\cosθ}, l_{2,D-}:y=-x\tanθ-\frac{D}{\cosθ},$$ where $D=\sqrt{d^2+\frac{{d_1}^2-{d_2}^2}{4}}.$ Note that each distance between $l_1$ and $l_{1,d\pm}$ is $d$, and that each distance between $l_2$ and $l_{2,D\pm}$ is $D$. Also, note the following: $$\sqrt{\left(\frac{d_1}{2}\right)^2+d^2}=\sqrt{\left(\frac{d_2}{2}\right)^2+D^2}.$$ This means that the radius of a circle which crosses $l_1$ equals the radius of a circle which crosses $l_2$. Note that $d$ must satisfy the following:$$0\le d\le \sqrt{1-\frac{{d_1}^2}{4}}.$$ Then, Letting each of the intersections of $l_{1,d-}$ and $l_{2,D+}$, $l_{1,d+}$ and $l_{2,D+}$, $l_{1,d+}$ and $l_{2,D-}$, $l_{1,d-}$ and $l_{2,D-}$ be $P_{-+}$, $P_{++}$, $P_{+-}$, $P_{--}$ respectively, we can represent these as the follwoings: $$P_{-+}\ \left(\frac{d+D}{2\sinθ}, \frac{-d+D}{2\cosθ}\right), P_{++}\ \left(\frac{-d+D}{2\sinθ}\frac{d+D}{2\cosθ}\right),$$$$P_{+-}\ \left(\frac{-d-D}{2\sinθ}, \frac{d-D}{2\cosθ}\right), P_{--}\ \left(\frac{d-D}{2\sinθ}, \frac{-d-D}{2\cosθ}\right).$$ Since each radius is $\sqrt{d^2+\frac{{d_1}^2}{4}}$, we can represent the circles by $d$ as the followings: $$C_{-+}:\left(x-\frac{d+D}{2\sinθ}\right)^2+\left(y-\frac{-d+D}{2\cosθ}\right)^2=d^2+\frac{{d_1}^2}{4}$$ $$C_{++}:\left(x-\frac{-d+D}{2\sinθ}\right)^2+\left(y-\frac{d+D}{2\cosθ}\right)^2=d^2+\frac{{d_1}^2}{4}$$ $$C_{+-}:\left(x-\frac{-d-D}{2\sinθ}\right)^2+\left(y-\frac{d-D}{2\cosθ}\right)^2=d^2+\frac{{d_1}^2}{4}$$ $$C_{--}:\left(x-\frac{d-D}{2\sinθ}\right)^2+\left(y-\frac{-d-D}{2\cosθ}\right)^2=d^2+\frac{{d_1}^2}{4}.$$ Changing $d$ to $-d$ in $C_{++}$ gives $C_{-+}$ and changing $d$ to $-d$ in $C_{+-}$ gives $C_{--}$. Hence, we can represent each possible invisible circle by $d$ as the following: $$C_{\pm+}:\left(x-\frac{-d+D}{2\sinθ}\right)^2+\left(y-\frac{d+D}{2\cosθ}\right)^2=d^2+\frac{{d_1}^2}{4}$$ $$C_{\pm-}:\left(x-\frac{-d-D}{2\sinθ}\right)^2+\left(y-\frac{d-D}{2\cosθ}\right)^2=d^2+\frac{{d_1}^2}{4}$$ for $d$ which satisfies the following: $$-\sqrt{1-\frac{{d_1}^2}{4}}\le d\le \sqrt{1-\frac{{d_1}^2}{4}}.$$ In addition to this, letting $(x,y)$ be the center of each circle, we get the following: $$xy=\frac{{d_1}^2-{d_2}^2}{16\cosθ\sinθ}.$$ This shows that the center of each possible invisible circle is on this hyperbola if $d_1-d_2>0$.

13,The locus of points from which tangents to a parabola make a constant angle is a hyperbola with the same focus as the parabola,The locus of points from which tangents to a parabola make a constant angle is a hyperbola with the same focus as the parabola,,"It is well known that when two tangents to a parabola are perpendicular to each other, they intersect on the directrix. In other words, the intersection point of the two tangents make a straight line, in this case, the directrix, However, when the two tangents to a parabola intersect at another angle, it seems that the intersection point of the two tangents always forms a hyperbola, regardless of the angle. (The original problem I encountered asked the trace of the intersection point when the angle was 45degrees) And surprisingly, the hyperbola has the same focus with the parabola. This can be proven by brute-force algebra, with the same method used to prove the directrix property. The question I'd like to ask is : Is there a geometric, or maybe an intuitive proof to why the trace of the intersection point forms a hyperbola, and why the focus of the hyperobla and parabola are the same?

(Sorry for my bad English; it is my first time writing mathematical topics in English, please correct me if anything is wrong)","It is well known that when two tangents to a parabola are perpendicular to each other, they intersect on the directrix. In other words, the intersection point of the two tangents make a straight line, in this case, the directrix, However, when the two tangents to a parabola intersect at another angle, it seems that the intersection point of the two tangents always forms a hyperbola, regardless of the angle. (The original problem I encountered asked the trace of the intersection point when the angle was 45degrees) And surprisingly, the hyperbola has the same focus with the parabola. This can be proven by brute-force algebra, with the same method used to prove the directrix property.

15,Painting the plane red and blue: Is it possible for each unit circumference to contain exactly $n$ blue points?,Painting the plane red and blue: Is it possible for each unit circumference to contain exactly  blue points?,n,"I recently stumbled upon the following problem: Consider the plane: You may color each point either red or blue.   Is there a way to color it such that each unit circumference (centred anywhere) contains exactly one blue point? And two? I solved it relatively easy: the ""one"" case has no solution, and the ""two"" case is solved placing the blue points in a set of parallel lines, at a distance of two from their neighbours. Of course I couldn't resist the temptation to consider the $n$ case: For $n$ even, the solution is easily extended considering lines at a distance of $4/n$. My question is: any help for the odd $n$ case? If there is any justice in the world, there should be no solution, but I honestly don't know where to start. EDIT: I have had this idea: if I have a solution for an $m$ case, and another for the $n$ case, such that they do not intersect (that is, whenever a point is blue in a solution it is not in the other) then simply superimposing the solutions yields a valid $m+n$ solution. It also stands to reason that if a $k$ solution exists, and contains an $m$ solution, then removing it yields a $k-m$ solution. So all that I need to prove is that an odd $k$ solution must contain a $k-1$ solution, and therefore also a $1$ solution, which I have shown cannot exist, and therefore also the generic odd solution cannot exist. For reference: I know geometry up to the basics of manifolds, analysis up to (but not including) Lebesgue measure and integration, and some group theory. Here is the proof for the $n = 1$ case: Obviously, there must be at least one blue point: otherwise any circumference would contain no blue points and break the condition. Consider the circle centred in that blue point: it must have one blue point. We therefore have two blue points at a distance of 1, therefore there is a circle that contains both, and violates the condition. Thus, there cannot be a successful configuration of blue points, QED. I also have this other proof: Take one blue point. Consider all circles containing that point. Those circles cannot have any other blue point, because they must have exactly one. All those circles cover a disc of radius 2 centered in the blue point, and said disc cannot contain any other blue points. Therefore the circle centered in the blue point contains no blue points and breaks the condition, QED.","I recently stumbled upon the following problem: Consider the plane: You may color each point either red or blue.

16,square cake with raisins,square cake with raisins,,"Alice bakes a square cake, with $n$ raisins (= points). Bob cuts $p$ square pieces. They are axis-aligned, interior-disjoint, and each piece must contain at least $2$ raisins. Note that a single raisin can be shared by two pieces (if it is on their boundary), or even four pieces (if it is on their corner). Bob tries to maximize the number of pieces $p$, and Alice tries to minimize $p$ by a sophisticated placement of the raisins. For a given $n$ (number of raisins), how should Alice place the raisins such as to minimize $p$, and what is the minimum? Here are some simple cases: For n=0, 1, obviously p=0. For n=2, 3, 4, Alice can make p=1, by placing the raisins on the corners of the cake, since the only square piece that can contain 2 raisins is the entire cake. For n=5, the minimum p is 2: there is at least one quarter of the cake that contains 2 raisins. Bob can cut a piece that contains these 2 raisins on its boundary, and is entirely contained within that quarter of the cake. Now there is enough room for another square, that contains one of these raisins and another raisin. What is the minimum $p$ for a given $n$? - Some insights: Given two raisins, the minimum length of a square that contains both of them is the chessboard distance between them. Therefore, it seems that Alice's best strategy is to maximize the  chessboard distances, and so force Bob to use large squares. This makes sense, but I cannot prove this. If n is a square number ($n = k^2$), then Alice can place the raisins in a k-by-k grid, such that the smallest chessboard distance between raisins is $1/(k-1)$. In this case, Bob can cut at most $(k-1)^2$ squares. But is this really Alice's best strategy? Bob can always do best with pieces that have raisins only on their boundary (He never has to cut a piece which has a raisin in the interior). PROOF: For any two raisins, there is a square that contains both of them in the boundary. If a piece contains two raisins in the interior, or one in the interior and one in the boundary, Bob can shrink that piece to get a square that has these two raisins in the boundary.

That seems a little awkward - is there a more natural way to say it? The standard distance metric on $\mathbb{R}^2$ is ""$\sqrt{(x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2}$"".

So my questions are: Out of all the possible metrics, why choose the Euclidean metric as the natural one? I think it's rotation that's the root cause, but that might end up being a red herring. How do we define a natural equivalence of points up to rotation from first principles? This is related to #1. If we define the set of infinite lines through the origin, you can choose a representative element from each one and form a perimeter curve(assuming a continuous choice function). What properties does the circle have that would make it a natural choice?",,"['geometry', 'trigonometry', 'metric-spaces', 'euclidean-geometry', 'circles']"

An example is shown with $n=8$ . What is the limit of the product of the areas of the regions, as $n$ approaches $\infty$ ? Using basic trigonometry, I've got: $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\prod_{k=1}^{n}\left(2-\frac{n}{\pi}\sin\left(\frac{2k\pi}{n}\right)+\frac{n}{\pi}\sin\left(\frac{2(k-1)\pi}{n}\right)\right)$$ I do not know how to evaluate this limit. Wolfram does not evaluate the limit, but tells me that when $n=10000$ the product is approximately $8.3$ . UPDATE1: I am fairly confident that the limit is $4\cosh^2\left({\frac{\pi}{2\sqrt{3}}}\right)=8.29674...$ Here's why. I was trying to answer a similar question: A ball is divided into $n$ concentric shells of equal thickness. Can the average volume of the shells be fixed so that the product of the volumes converges to a positive number as $n\to\infty$ ? The answer turns out to be yes. If we fix the average volume of the shells to be $\frac{e^2}{3}$ then the product of the volumes converges to $2\cosh\left({\frac{\pi}{2\sqrt{3}}}\right)=2.8804...$ I noticed that this number seemed to be (to many decimal places) the square root of the answer to the question here. I think there must be a connection. UPDATE2: Another similar question is this. A disk is divided into $n$ regions by equally spaced parallel lines, with the perimeter of the disk being tangent to two of the lines. Can the average area of the regions be fixed so that the product of the areas converges to a positive number as $n\to\infty$ ? The answer seems to be yes. If we fix the average area of the regions to be $\frac{{\pi}e}{8}$ then the product of the areas seems to converge to $2\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2\sqrt{3}}\right)$ (notice this is cos, not cosh).

33,A way to determine the ideal number of maximum iterations for an arbitrary zoom level in a Mandelbrot fractal,A way to determine the ideal number of maximum iterations for an arbitrary zoom level in a Mandelbrot fractal,,"I've created a JavaScript-based fractal drawer which you can see here: http://jsfiddle.net/xfF3f/12/ As you're probably all aware, a Mandelbrot Set is created by iterating over pixels as though they were coordinates on the real and imaginary planes. Each pixel then has a real and an imaginary part (like all complex numbers) which can be fed into an iterative loop of its own: $ z = z^2 + c $ Where both z and c are complex numbers, z starts at 0 , and c is the value of our pixel. If you run this a bunch of times, the squared modulus of z ( |z| ) will either stay below a limit you set (6 in my fractal drawer) or it will go above the limit. If it goes above the limit, you break the iteration and consider that pixel to be outside of the set. When this happens, you color that pixel a certain color depending on how big |z| has gotten and how many iterations it took to determine that it's outset the set. (See more on the formula used in my drawer here: Continuous coloring of a Mandelbrot fractal ) So given all this, we can say that a higher max iteration value will tell you with greater precision whether or not a point is in the set. It will also take more time to run because it's doing more calculations per pixel. There are also other visual factors... If you start at a full zoom out and run the plot with a maxIterations value of 50, 100, and 300, you get this: So you can see that while the detail of the edge of the set does get better as you increase the maxIterations value, the pixels outside the set are almost all red. At this zoom level, I'd say something like 50 iterations would be an ideal balance of color variation and edge detail. Now if you zoom in to some arbitrary level keeping 50 maxIterations, you will begin to see something like this: The detail is horrible and the colors are also a bit homogeneous. So let's see what happens if we keep the same zoom level and change the maxIterations number to 80, 120, 250, 500, 1000, and 2000 (remember, the coordinates and zoom are exactly the same in all images, the only difference is the maxIterations value): As usual, increasing the maxIterations value too much leaves most of the points outside of the set red. Here I'd say something between the second (120 maxIterations) and third (250 maxIterations) is more or less ideal. This is all relatively simple to do one image at a time with your eye and some tinkering, but this would be very difficult to do if I were to create a zoom like this: http://vimeo.com/1908224 . I'd need some method of finding something like an ideal maxIterations value depending on the zoom level. So after all of this, my question is: is there some such method? If not, where might I start to look in order to figure this out for myself? Am I thinking about this wrong? Is there a more obvious solution that I'm missing?

Using cylindrical coordinates $(r,\theta,z)$, where the $z$ axis is that of the helix, and using the parametric equation of the section curve of the surface by the plane $xz$, $(r(u),0,z(u))$, the equation of the swept surface is $$(r(u),v,z(u)+\sigma v)$$ where $\sigma$ is the pitch.

I mean it intuitively makes sense but can we give a logical reason. I mean it could've been the case that when we join up the triangles then two of the triangles just don't meet. Like this: Now, after we connect $C$ and $E$ (shown by the dotted line), if we can show that $CE=6$ then we can simply show that such a picture is a contradiction because then all the sides of $\triangle{PCE}$ and $\triangle{PCD}$ will be equal which will mean that they are similar triangles but clearly $\angle{PCE}\neq\angle{PCD}$ which is a contradiction. The problem became when my friend asked me how can I say that $CE=6$ which caught me off guard. And now, after spending a few hours using trignometry to show that $CE=6$ , I am clueless.

63,How to appreciate Riemannian geometry,How to appreciate Riemannian geometry,,"I'm currently following an introduction to Riemannian geometry i.e. connections, curvature and isometric immersions (the Gauss, Codazi and Ricci equations). I find the introduction to Riemannian geometry interesting, but whenever I look at some theorems beyond the introductory topics they seem quite artificial and not intuitive. Also I can't see why they are interesting for us? There are many examples, one of them is Schur's lemma which goes as follows: Let $M$ be a Riemannian manifold of dimension $n \geq 3$. Suppose that for every plane $\pi$ in $T_pM$, $K(\pi)$ (the sectional curvature) has the same value $c(p)$. Then $c(p)$ is a constant function. First the theorem only works in $n\geq 3$, but my main problem is that my intuition lives in surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$ where there is only one plane $\pi $ in  $T_pM$. Hence what is the intuition behind this lemma? How can one see the beauty of such theorems? This is however unfortunate since the theory of Riemannian geometry is a popular branch of mathematics which implies many people are interested in it (and probably see the beauty of such theorems and problems). The purpose of my question is to get some intuition or feeling for it so I can appreciate such theorems. EDIT 1: The very general question, has more concrete subquestions: Why are we interested in the relation between curvature and the shape of manifolds, what is the importance of this? How does one intuitively see which relations (in 1)) one can expect and which not? (for example if the sectional curvatures are $\leq 0$ then for what properties of $M$ can one hope for?) Some theorems hold only in specific higher dimensions, for example Schur's lemma above. How does a mathematician find such theorems and proofs?

Less well, known however is the Postulate that forms the basis for motivation behind the fifth: the fourth one , which states that ""all right angles are equal.""  Students who see this for the first time might find this puzzling, because obviously two angles which are equal to a 90 degree angle are equal to each other, since Common Notion 1 says that ""things which are equal to the same thing are are also equal to one another"".  But then they realize that the matter is so straightforward: the definition of a right angle is an angle produced when two lines intersect each other and produce equal adjacent angles, and it's not clear why an angle produced by one such pair of lines should bear any relation to an angle produced by another such pair of lines. So Euclid's fourth Postulate is not redundant for the reason that beginning students might think.  But my question is, is it nevertheless a redundant postulate, although for far less trivial reasons?  David Hilbert, in his Foundations of Geometry (Grundlagen der Geometrie in German), claims to prove Euclid's fourth Postulate in theorem 15 (on page 19 of the PDF or page 13 according to the book's internal page numbering), prefacing the proof by saying ""it is possible to deduce the following simple theorem, which Euclid held - although it seems to me wrongly - to be an axiom."" Now it's fair to say that Hilbert was working in a different (and more rigorous) system of axioms than Euclid was, but I think Hilbert's proof should be seriously considered for two reasons.  First of all, why would he dub Euclid's decision to call ""all right angles are equal"" a Postulate as ""wrong"" if it merely reflected a stylistic difference concerning what you choose as starting assumptions and what you consider theorems?  But more importantly, by tracing back all the assumptions used in the proof of theorem 15, it seems to me that only four of Hilbert's axioms are ultimately used: IV 3, IV 4, IV 5, and IV 6.  And I don't think Euclid would have objected to any of these statements: IV 3 follows directly from Euclid's Common Notion 2. IV 4 is partly stated in Euclid's Book I Proposition 23 , which doesn't depend on the fourth postulate, and the part of IV 4 which (I think) is not stated is easily provable in Euclid's system. IV 5 follows from Euclid's Common Notion 1 . IV 6 is just part of Euclid's Book I Proposition 4 , which doesn't depend on the fourth postulate at all. So could Euclid have proven his fourth Postulate as a theorem instead of just assuming it? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank You in Advance.

69,About translating subsets of $\Bbb R^2.$,About translating subsets of,\Bbb R^2.,"I'm looking for a pair of sets $A,B$ of points in $\Bbb R^2$ such that $A$ is a union of translated (only translations are allowed) copies of $B;$ $B$ is a union of translated copies of $A;$ $A$ is not a a single translated copy of $B$ (and the other way around, which follows). The unions are arbitrary, even uncountable, and they need not be disjoint. I can't even decide whether I believe such $A,B$ should exist or not. Could you help me please? I've looked at many different sets, and I suspect that if such sets exist, then $A$ and $B$ need to be rather strange, but I can prove nothing interesting other than that $A$ and $B$ cannot be finite. It seems unlikely to me that there could be examples of positive finite measure, but I can't prove it. I've tried with many zero-measure and infinite-measure sets, but I really have no clue. (I should note that if such sets exist but are non-measurable, I'm interested in them too.) Sorry if the tags are wrong, but I'm just not sure which ones to use. Added. I think defining $A$ and $B$ recursively could work. If I take two sets of vectors $X$ and $Y$, then a set $A_0$, and then define $B_n=A_{n-1}+X,$  $A_n=B_n+Y$ for $n>0$, then $$\left(\bigcup_{n\geq0}A_n\right)+X=\bigcup_{n\geq0}(A_n+X)=\bigcup_{n>0}B_n$$ and also $$\left(\bigcup_{n>0}B_n\right)+Y=\bigcup_{n>0}(B_n+X)=\bigcup_{n>0}A_n.$$ So if $\displaystyle\bigcup_{n\geq0}A_n=\bigcup_{n>0}A_n$ or, equivalently, $\displaystyle A_0\subseteq\bigcup_{n>0}A_n,$ then the sets $A=\displaystyle\bigcup_{n>0}A_n$ and $B=\displaystyle\bigcup_{n>0}B_n$ are unions of translated copies of each other. One obvious way to achieve that is to have an $x\in X$ such that $-x\in Y.$ Then $$A_0=A_0+x-x\subseteq A_0+X+Y=A_1.$$ But then also $$A+x\subseteq A+X=B$$ and $$B-x\subseteq B+Y=A,$$ whence $B\subseteq A+x$ and so $A+x=B.$ So this doesn't work. I think that it could be a good idea to make the ""comeback to $A_0$"" take infinitely many steps, so the vectors that are used to ""come back"" don't add up to any single vector. Unfortunately this is rather vague.

The unions are arbitrary, even uncountable, and they need not be disjoint. I can't even decide whether I believe such $A,B$ should exist or not. Could you help me please? I've looked at many different sets, and I suspect that if such sets exist, then $A$ and $B$ need to be rather strange, but I can prove nothing interesting other than that $A$ and $B$ cannot be finite. It seems unlikely to me that there could be examples of positive finite measure, but I can't prove it. I've tried with many zero-measure and infinite-measure sets, but I really have no clue. (I should note that if such sets exist but are non-measurable, I'm interested in them too.) Sorry if the tags are wrong, but I'm just not sure which ones to use. Added. I think defining $A$ and $B$ recursively could work. If I take two sets of vectors $X$ and $Y$, then a set $A_0$, and then define $B_n=A_{n-1}+X,$  $A_n=B_n+Y$ for $n>0$, then $$\left(\bigcup_{n\geq0}A_n\right)+X=\bigcup_{n\geq0}(A_n+X)=\bigcup_{n>0}B_n$$ and also $$\left(\bigcup_{n>0}B_n\right)+Y=\bigcup_{n>0}(B_n+X)=\bigcup_{n>0}A_n.$$ So if $\displaystyle\bigcup_{n\geq0}A_n=\bigcup_{n>0}A_n$ or, equivalently, $\displaystyle A_0\subseteq\bigcup_{n>0}A_n,$ then the sets $A=\displaystyle\bigcup_{n>0}A_n$ and $B=\displaystyle\bigcup_{n>0}B_n$ are unions of translated copies of each other. One obvious way to achieve that is to have an $x\in X$ such that $-x\in Y.$ Then $$A_0=A_0+x-x\subseteq A_0+X+Y=A_1.$$ But then also $$A+x\subseteq A+X=B$$ and $$B-x\subseteq B+Y=A,$$ whence $B\subseteq A+x$ and so $A+x=B.$ So this doesn't work. I think that it could be a good idea to make the ""comeback to $A_0$"" take infinitely many steps, so the vectors that are used to ""come back"" don't add up to any single vector.

I had an idea for a comic about gerrymandering. As you may know, gerrymandering is a significant social problem, in that it stifles voters' opinions. So, my idea was this: Why not make a rule that perimeter/area always has to be under a certain value. I figured this would limit how salamander-like the districts could be made. Then, I tried to figure out the math of this on the assumption that it was a simple calculus min/max problem. It seems not to be... The biggest problem I'm running into is how to formalize the idea of a shape being weird. My intuition tells me that the lower perimeter/area is, the less weird the shape. I.e. a wacky snakey shape designed to get several populations will have a higher perimeter/area than a more reasonable district shape, which should be vaguely rectangular or circular. But, I don't know how to mathematize that. If that could be proved, you could probably figure out a reasonable ratio.

One with a side of $\frac{ab}{a+b}$ and the other of $\frac{abc}{c^2 + ab}$ , $c$ being the hypotenuse. After some time, I realized that there was a common formula for all triangles. And that is: $$side = \frac{ch}{c+h}$$ or $$\frac{1}{side} = \frac{1}{c} + \frac{1}{h}$$ where, $h$ is height on base $c$ , or $$h = \frac{2\sqrt{(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c))}}{c}$$ I achieved the above results using similar triangles, and have added a figure, to make the point clear. But that is all, I can prove. I tested for many triangles, and found that the smaller side always yields the larger square, but I am not able to prove it. For example, I can say that the largest square of a $4,7,10$ triangle, has area of approximately $\fraq{16}{3}$ .
