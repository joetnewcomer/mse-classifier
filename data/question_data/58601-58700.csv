We also use the notation $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \sup (s_n) = s^*$$ $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \inf (s_n) = s_*$$ This is my understanding. a), $\{s_n\}$ is a sequence, and its subsequence (there are $\infty$ many patterns) $\{s_{n_k}\}$ has many different limits. That's why it's possible to have a set $E$ which may contain more than one limit. b), The limit of $\{s_n\}$ is not necessarily the limit of all subsequence of $\{s_n\}$ . c), The ""largest"" number $x$ in $E$ is the ""upper limit.""

The series is: $\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{(\ln(n))^{12}}{n^{\frac{9}{8}}}$ I can say I have eliminated the possibility of telescoping and geometric series. I have performed the divergence test and the limit of the sequence approaches 0, so I know that I need to do more test to actually determine if it diverges or converges. I have attempted the integral test, however, I am not really sure if it is possible to integrate the function (maybe a really drawn out integration by parts? I haven't tried because I believe there has to be a cleaner method). I have tried the direct comparison but struggle to choose a good comparison for the test, my initial thought was comparing to an equation with a denominator raised to a power slightly lower, but still greater than 1 so it would converge via p-test. That does not work due to the variable in the numerator. On the limit comparison test, all my comparisons lead to inconclusive results on the behavior of the series. I am sure there is probably an easy or interesting solution, but I need help to find it.","I am asked to prove the divergence or convergence of this series using any of these methods: Telescoping, Geometric Series, Divergence Test, Integral Test, Direct Comparison, and Limit Comparison.

It went like this: Present an example of a convergent series of complex numbers $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}z_n$ such that $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}z_n^3$ diverges. My solution was to make use of the cube root of unity, by defining $\large z_n=\frac{e^{2\pi i n/3}}{\sqrt[3]{n}}$ . In this fashion, one can easily see that $\large z_n^3=\frac{e^{2\pi i n}}{n}=\frac{1}{n}$ , and so $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}z_n^3$ diverges by the harmonic series. However, I was not able to prove that the series of $z_n$ was convergent. I am somewhat positive that the series is indeed convergent, as WolframAlpha computes that it converges to $\text{Li}_{1/3}(e^{2\pi i/3})$ . It's quite obvious that the convergence won't be absolute, as $|z_n|=\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{n}}$ gives a divergent series. I attempted to separate $z_n=a_n+b_n i$ for $a_n=\cos(2\pi n/3)/\sqrt[3]{n}$ and $b_n=\sin(2\pi n/3)/\sqrt[3]{n}$ , but I couldn't get this to be very fruitful. Any ideas? Note: I also know that there are sequences $z_n$ that satisfy this property and are such that $\mathfrak{Im}(z_n)=0$ , but this is not what I'm looking for.","I was thinking and revisiting a problem that I had to solve last year in an Introductory Complex Analysis exam.
