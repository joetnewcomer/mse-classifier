0,Proof of an inequality by induction: $(1 + x_1)(1 + x_2)...(1 + x_n) \ge 1 + x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n$,Proof of an inequality by induction:,(1 + x_1)(1 + x_2)...(1 + x_n) \ge 1 + x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n,"Let $n \in \mathbb N^+$. Show that if $x_1, x_2, ... , x_n$ are $n$ real numbers such that $-1 \le x_i \le 0$ for each $1 \le i \le n$, then $$(1 + x_1)(1 + x_2)...(1 + x_n) \ge 1 + x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n$$ I am using a proof by induction, but I am unable to complete it. I would appreciate any tips on how I could finish the proof. Incomplete Proof Let $P(n)$ be the proposition that $(1 + x_1)(1 + x_2)...(1 + x_n) \ge 1 + \sum_{i = 1} ^ n x_i$. When $n = 1$, LHS = RHS = $1 + x_i$. Clearly $1 + x_i \ge 1 + x_i$ and so $P(1)$ is true. Assume that $P(k)$ is true, i.e. $(1 + x_1)(1 + x_2)...(1 + x_k) \ge 1 + \sum_{i=1}^k x_i$. Case 1 Suppose $x_{k + 1}  = -1$. Then $1 + x_{k + 1} = 0$, hence LHS = $(1 + x_1)(1 + x_2)...(1 + x_k)(1 + x_{k+1}) = 0$. RHS = $1 + x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_k - 1 = x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_k$ which is always nonpositive since each $x_i$ is nonpositive. Hence RHS $\le 0$ and so LHS $\ge$ RHS. Case 2 Suppose $x_{k+1} = 0$. Then $1 + x_{k+1} = 1$, hence multiplying it to LHS does not change anything. Also, adding $x_{k+1}$ to RHS does not change anything. Therefore, LHS $\ge$ RHS still holds.

Are there any other integrals that can be computed in a similar way? My question is intentionally vague--any techniques however tangentially related are of interest! (EDIT 1: To be more specific, what I am imagining is whether it is possible that some definite integrals appear algebraically out of a computation of a double or triple integral in some coordinate system. Or, if there are some heuristic arguments that this probably impossible. Or if someone has a better imagination as to a computation being similar to the example I gave is also good.) (EDIT 2: It would also be interesting if someone could example how one might come up with the computation in the original example instead of it being seen as an after the factor sort of thing.)",,"['calculus', 'analysis', 'multivariable-calculus', 'soft-question']"

For a) (correction : see edit 1 below), I use as parametrization $(\cos(\theta),\sin(\theta),\cos(\theta))$ . The gradient is $(-\sin(\theta),\cos(\theta),-\sin(\theta))$ . The dot product of that with our vector field in polar coordinates $(-\sin(\theta),2\cos(\theta),-\sin(\theta)+\sin^3(\theta)+\cos(\theta))$ is simply $2-\sin^4(\theta)-\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)$ . If we integrate that from $0$ to $2\pi$ , we get $\frac{13\pi}{4}$ noting that $\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)$ vanishes. For b), the curl of our vector field is $(3y^2-2,0,2)$ . Our parametrization is $(r\cos(\theta),r\sin(\theta),r\cos(\theta))$ . The cross product of the partial derivatives is simply $(-r,0,r)$ . The dot product of that with our curl in polar coordinates is $4r-3r^3\sin^2(\theta)$ . So now, we have $$\int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{1}(4r-3r^3\sin^2(\theta))rdrd\theta=\pi\int_{0}^{1}(8r^2-3r^4)rdr=\frac{31\pi}{15}$$ So I don't see where I did something wrong, or where I forgot something. Thanks for your help ! Edit 1: Okay, as was pointed out in the comments and in one answer, I used a wrong parametrization in a). I should use $\frac{\cos(\theta)}{\sqrt{2}}$ instead of $\cos(\theta)$ for the parametrization of $x$ and $z$ . In this case, we get the dot product of $(-\sin(\theta), \sqrt{2}\cos(\theta), -\sin(\theta)+\sin^3(\theta)+\frac{\cos(\theta)}{\sqrt{2}})$ and $(\frac{-\sin(\theta)}{\sqrt{2}}, \cos(\theta),\frac{-\sin(\theta)}{\sqrt{2}}) $ which yields $$\frac{\sin^2(\theta)}{\sqrt{2}}+\sqrt{2}\cos^2(\theta)+\frac{\sin^2(\theta)}{\sqrt{2}}-\frac{\sin^4(\theta)}{\sqrt{2}}-\frac{\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)}{2}$$ . If we integrate that from $0$ to $2\pi$ , the last term vanishes and using the common trig identity, we simply integrate $\sqrt{2}-\frac{\sin^4(\theta)}{\sqrt{2}}$ . So we get $\frac{13\pi}{4\sqrt{2}}$ . But it's still different fom b) though. Edit 2 : As was pointed out in the comments, I also need to use the new parametrization for part b). But even so, I get $\frac{31\pi}{15\sqrt{2}}$ The cross product of the derivatives is $(\frac{-r}{\sqrt{2}},0,\frac{r}{\sqrt{2}})$ . We need to integrate from $0$ to $2\pi$ $d\theta$ and from $0$ to $1$ $dr$ the following (the curl remains the same): $(\frac{4r}{\sqrt{2}}-\frac{3r^3sin^2(\theta)}{\sqrt{2}})r=\frac{4r^2}{\sqrt{2}}-\frac{3r^4sin^2(\theta)}{\sqrt{2}}$ which yields $\frac{8\pi r^3}{3\sqrt{2}}-\frac{3\pi r^5}{5\sqrt{2}}$ evaluated from $0$ to $1$ and so we get $\frac{31\pi}{15\sqrt{2}}$ Edit 3 : problem solved.

97,Non-wandering set (definitions),Non-wandering set (definitions),,"For a map $f\colon X\to X$, a point $p\in X$ is called non-wandering , provided for every neighborhood $U$ of $p$ there exists an integer $n>0$ such that $f^n(U)\cap U\neq\emptyset$. Sometimes, I also read the following definition: For either maps or flows a point $p\in X$ is said to be a nonwandering point, if given any neighborhood $U$ of $p$ there exists a sequence of times $t_n\to\infty$ such that $f^{t_n}(p)\in U$ for all $n$. Hence, non-wandering points are points whose neighborhoods the map visits infinitely often. Are these definitions equivalent? Does the first definition also imply that each neighborhood of $p$ is visited infinitely often?","For a map $f\colon X\to X$, a point $p\in X$ is called non-wandering , provided for every neighborhood $U$ of $p$ there exists an integer $n>0$ such that $f^n(U)\cap U\neq\emptyset$.

98,Monotone approximating sequence for measurable function,Monotone approximating sequence for measurable function,,"Let $f\in L^2(K)$ (with values in $\mathbb{R})$, where $K\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ is compact. Then one knows that there exists a sequence $f_n$ of continuous functions on $K$ that converges pointwise almost everwhere to $f$. For example one can get this by judiciously taking a subsequence of a sequence of continuous functions converging to $f$ in $L^2(K)$. I'm wondering, is it possible to get a sequence of continuous functions $f'_n$ that converges to $f$ pointwise almost everywhere, with the property that $f'_n(x)\geq f'_m(x)$ whenver $n\geq m$? Thanks!","Let $f\in L^2(K)$ (with values in $\mathbb{R})$, where $K\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ is compact.

99,How to prove that $\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{t}{x^2+t^2}\cos(ax)dx=\frac{\pi}{2}e^{-at}$.,How to prove that .,\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{t}{x^2+t^2}\cos(ax)dx=\frac{\pi}{2}e^{-at},"I want to prove that for $t,a>0$: $$f_a(t)=\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{t}{x^2+t^2}\cos(ax)dx=\frac{\pi}{2}e^{-at}$$ It is easy to prove that  $$f_a''(t)=a^2f_a(t),$$ then $$f_a(t)=c_1e^{at}+c_2e^{-at}$$ Cleary $\lim\limits_{t\to 0}f_a(t)=0$ and therefore $c_1=0$. But I could not justify that $c_2=\frac{\pi}{2}$. Any idea?
