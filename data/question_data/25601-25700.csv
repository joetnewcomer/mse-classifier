2,Find a plane with distance $3$ from $3x-y-z = 0$,Find a plane with distance  from,3 3x-y-z = 0,"I need to find a plane such that its distance from the plane $3x-y-z = 0$ is $3$. Since distance is defined only for parallel planes, I already know that they have to be parallel, and then, the equation of the new plane will have the same normal vector $(3,-1,-1)$. Also, this plane intersects the origin, because $(0,0,0)$ satisfies its equation. So my idea was to normalize the normal vector, and then multiply it by $3$. I could then put it in the origin and see it as a point of distance $3$ from the origin (and also from the plane), and then this point should be in the new plane, so it must satisfy is equation, which is: $$3x-y-z + d = 0$$ I think this migth work, but I don't think it's the best way to solve this exercise.

3,A question on Green's functions & integral operators,A question on Green's functions & integral operators,,"I'm fairly new to the concept of Green's functions, but from what I understand so far, they are a powerful tool for solving PDEs with boundary conditions.

Why is it possible to represent it like this?

So, finding the basis of the column space should be equivalent to finding the basis of the range. I got the following after reducing: $$\mathrm{Rref}(A) =\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -\frac 12\\ 0 & 0 &  0\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} $$ Because I only have a pivot in column $1$, my corresponding column in the original $A$ (thus my basis for the range), would be: $$\mathrm{Rref}(A) =\begin{bmatrix} 2\\ 4\\ 0 \end{bmatrix} $$ The solution given in the text says that this should actually be: $$\mathrm{Rref}(A) =\begin{bmatrix} 1\\ 2\\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$$ I can see that the book solution only differs from mine in that their solution seems to have been divided by $2$. However, my question is - why are they dividing by 2? I don't understand why the original column is being altered.

I request verification, feedback, or alternate approaches (especially ways to simplify). Solution: In $\mathbb R^n$ , the ellipsoid $\sum_{i \leq j} x_ix_j = 1$ has a single axis of length $\sqrt {\frac 8 {n+1}}$ and all other axes length $2\sqrt 2$ . Proof: Recall that if $D$ is a diagonal matrix, then $$\mathbf x^\top D \mathbf x = 1$$ is an ellipsoid in standard position, with axis $i$ of length $\frac 2 {\sqrt {D_{ii}}}$ . Simple multiplication shows that the ellipsoid $\sum_{i \leq j} x_ix_j = 1$ has equation $$\mathbf x^\top S \mathbf x = 1$$ where $$S_{ij} = \begin{cases}1 &\text{ if } i = j\\ \frac 1 2 &\text{ otherwise}.\end{cases}$$ Since $S$ is symmetric, the spectral theorem shows that $S$ has $n$ orthogonal eigenvectors with real eigenvalues, and that $S$ decomposes into $S = DQ$ , with $Q$ orthogonal and $D$ diagonal.  The diagonal entries of $D$ are the eigenvalues of $S$ . Since $Q$ is orthogonal, it preserves lengths.  Consequently, if the eigenvalues of $S$ are $\lambda_i$ , then the ellipsoid's axes will have length $\frac 2 {\sqrt {\lambda_i}}$ . Inspection shows that the vector $\mathbf \ell$ with all components $1$ is an eigenvector of $S$ with eigenvalue $\frac {n+1} 2$ .  Inspection likewise shows that for $1 \leq i < n$ , the vectors $\mathbf m_i$ with components $$m_{i_j} = \begin{cases} 1 &\text{ if } j = i \\ 1 - \sqrt n - n &\text{ if } j = n\\ 1 + \sqrt n&\text{ otherwise}\end{cases}$$ are other eigenvectors, each with eigenvalue $\frac 1 2$ , which completes the proof. Remark: The components of $\mathbf m_i$ were determined by solving for $$a + (n-2)b + c = 0 \text{ since } \mathbf m_i \cdot \mathbf \ell = 0 \\ 2ab + (n-3)b^2 + c^2 = 0 \text{ since } \mathbf m_i \cdot \mathbf m_j = 0 \text { when } i \neq j.$$ Is there a simpler way to determine them?  The fact that the rows of $S$ are rotations of each other suggests some type of symmetry of its eigenvalues, and we know their sum from $\operatorname{trace} S = n$ , but I could not develop this further.","Find the lengths of the principal axes of the ellipsoid -- Arnold, Trivium 85 My solution is below.
