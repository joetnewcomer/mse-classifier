Vakil's lecture notes: chapter 14 section 3 on Effective Divisors and Invertible sheaves.

I don't understand what this means, so I presume that if we take the global section, we have a mapping of $A$-modules (all rings are denoted by $A$) $$ \mathcal{O}_{X}(X)\rightarrow\mathcal{O}(D)(X)$$ sending $1$ to some element $f\in \mathcal{O}(D)(X)=\mathcal{O}(-D)^{\vee}(X)=\text{Hom}_{\mathcal{O}_{X}}(\mathcal{O}(-D)|_{X},\mathcal{O}_{X}|_{X})$ So based on this observation, I need to show Ex 14.3.B: show that $Z(s_{D})$ is exactly the subscheme cut out by   $D$. But an effective divisor in the sense of R. Vakil's notes is actually an effective Cartier divisor. In some other sources (See Götz-Wedhorn Algebraic Geometry I, page 305, Remark 11.31(2)) the canonical divisor $s_{D}$ is defined to be as follows: since $D$ is effective Cartier, there exists $(U_{i},f_{i})_{i}$ where $U_{i}$ is an affine covering of $X$ and $f_{i}\in \Gamma(U_{i},\mathscr{K}^{*}_{X})$ Question 1 : If $D$ is effective but $X$ is NOT assumed to be reduced, can we still assume that $f_{i}\in\Gamma(U_{i},\mathcal{O}_{X})$? Because if it is not reduced, we cannot use Algebraic Hartog's lemma... Then in Götz-Wedhorn, they define the canonical section $s_{D}$ to be exactly the data $(U_{i},f_{i})$.

My problem here is that I can not make this precise. (I also struggle again with the fact that he talks about the dimension of the set). If $E$ is an effective, special divisor, then there is an effective divisor $F$ such that $K-E \sim F$ and thus $K\sim F+E$ and $F+E$ is effective. So we could define a map $E \mapsto E+F$ and its injectivity would imply the bound of the dimension. However, there might be multiple suitable $F$ (so a choice has to be made?) and the bound of the dimension only makes sense if the map respects some sort of structure.

The intersection multiplicity of $X,Y$ at $P$ is defined as the dimension of the $k$-vector space $\mathcal{O}_P/(f,g)$, where $\mathcal{O}_P$ is the local ring at $P$.
