0,How to get a geometric morphism out of a section? (And general pedagogy on classifying toposes),How to get a geometric morphism out of a section? (And general pedagogy on classifying toposes),,"Let $\mathcal{E}$ and $\mathcal{F}$ be toposes, $X$ an object of $\mathcal{E}$ and $p: \mathcal{E}/X \rightarrow \mathcal{E}$ the canonical geometric morphism (whose inverse image part is pullback along $p: X \rightarrow 1$.) I am trying to figure out the correspondence between geometric morphisms $\mathcal{F} \rightarrow \mathcal{E}/X$ over $\mathcal{E}$ and ""global sections"" $1 \rightarrow f^*(X)$. More precisely, I am looking to establish $$\text{Hom}_{\textbf{Topoi}/ \mathcal{E}} ( f: \mathcal{F} \rightarrow \mathcal{E}, \mathcal{E}/X) \cong \text{Hom}_{\mathcal{F}} (1, f^{*} (X))$$ Given a geometric morphism $g$ it is easy to get a section. One simply sends $g$ to the section $$g^* (\Delta) : 1 \rightarrow g^*(\pi_2 : X \times X \rightarrow X) = g^* \circ p^* (X) = f^*(X) $$ where $\pi_2$ is the standard projection and $\Delta$ the diagonal map $X \rightarrow X \times X$. (The idea is that $\Delta$ is the universal section, classifying the identity $\mathcal{E}/X = \mathcal{E}/X$.) I'm having some difficulty figuring out the converse. Given a section $s : 1 \rightarrow f^*(X)$ we do get a geometric morphism $\mathcal{F} \rightarrow \mathcal{F}/f^*(X)$ and I can see that this ought to be 'sendable' to $\mathcal{E}/X$ but cannot figure out a nice way to do this via a geometric morphism (the wall I keep hitting is that the unit map $\eta_X : X \rightarrow f_* f^*(X)$ induces a geometric morphism in the 'wrong' direction.) So I guess my first question is: How does one get the right-to-left correspondence, i.e. from sections to geometric morphisms in this case? In general, I am also interested to hear how one should generally think of these classifying problems (finding classifying topoi for given structures.) I am new to the game and every case I encounter seems to me now devoid of a general principle of attack. In some cases it seems much easier to go from 'points'/'individual structures' to geometric morphisms. For example, in geometric cases, a point immediately gives the stalk/skyscraper adjunction and hence a geometric morphism. In other cases, like the one above, where the universal structure is clear, it is much easier to go from geometric morphism to a 'point'/'structure'. So my second question is this: Is there a good standard way to think/attack such problems? Should one always try and figure out the universal structure first? Should one think geometrically? Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated... (NOTE: I understand that the second question is not very precise, but neither am I looking for very precise answers.) Finally, a bonus question: is the correspondence in the problem above (the first equation) a kind of adjunction between functors $\textbf{Topoi}/\mathcal{E} \overset{\leftarrow}{\rightarrow} \mathcal{F}$ (where $\mathcal{F}$ lies over $\mathcal{E}$.) Can one view this as some sort of adjunction in this manner? I suspect not, but I'd like to know if this is a fact made more elegant from a 2-categorical perspective...","Let $\mathcal{E}$ and $\mathcal{F}$ be toposes, $X$ an object of $\mathcal{E}$ and $p: \mathcal{E}/X \rightarrow \mathcal{E}$ the canonical geometric morphism (whose inverse image part is pullback along $p: X \rightarrow 1$.)

1,Realizing $S_n$ as a Galois group,Realizing  as a Galois group,S_n,"My question is about the realization of the symmetric group $S_n$ as a galois group of a real and normal field extension $K/\mathbb Q$. As I read, such a field $K$ can be obtained as the splitting field of a polynomial $$f(x)=\alpha_0 + \alpha_1 x + ... + \alpha_{n-1}x^{n-1}+ x^n \in \mathbb Q[x] $$ in which all the coefficients $\alpha_i$ have to be integral for the prime numbers 2 and 3. Furthermore, the following properties have to be satisfied: (1)  $\ f \text{ mod }3$ is irreducible (2)  $\ f \equiv (x^2+x+1)\cdot f_1 \cdots  f_k \text{  mod }2$ where $f_i \in \mathbb Z / 2 \mathbb Z[x]$ are different and irreducible polynomials with odd degree. (3) $f$ have to be near at $(x-1)\cdot (x-2) \cdots (x-n) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + ... + \beta_{n-1}x^{n-1}+ x^n$, that does mean $|\alpha_i - \beta_i|< \varepsilon$ for all $i$ and $\varepsilon$ should be chosen so small, that there are $n$ real roots of $f$. Now, it is claimed, that because of (1) the galois group of $f$ over $\mathbb Q$ is a transitive subgroup of $\mathbb S_n$. I think, this is true, because of the fact, that $f$ is also irreducible in $\mathbb Q[x]$ and therefore the galois group acts transitively on the roots of $f$. Ok, now comes an assertion that I don't understand: Because of (2) the galois group of $f$ over $\mathbb Q$ contains a transposition. Please could you explain that to me? I think, (2) shows, that there is a permutation of the form $(ab)(...)...(...)$. But how to continue the argument?

Consider a polynomial $p\in\Bbb R[X,Y]$ . If it has no roots, the roots are isolated points, or we are dealing with the zero polynomial the answer is trivial. We are therefore only interested in the case where $Z(p)$ is a one-dimensional subset of $\Bbb R^2$ . A simple example to consider is then: $$ aX^2 + bY^2 - c = 0 $$ where, even if we did not know that the zero set was an ellipse, we could reasonably guess that the curve is closed since both $X$ and $Y$ are bounded. This immediately implies that the curve divides the plane into two regions, one bounded and one unbounded. Another example is a hyperbola $$ aX^2 - bY^2 - c = 0 $$ where now $X$ and $Y$ are unbounded, the zero set consists of two disjoint one-dimensional sets and therefore it divides the plane into three unbounded areas. A more interesting case is the Tschirnhaus cubic: $$ X^3 - X^2 + Y^2 = 0 $$ which is a connected curve with a singularity, from which we can deduce that it divides the plane into three segments; One bounded and two unbounded. Now these are nontrivial conclusions, and require some work to arrive at and rigorously justify. Now I ask: Is there a single (algorithmic) way to determine into how many segments any given polynomial $$ \sum a_{ij}X^iY^j\quad a_{ij}\in \Bbb R $$ will divide the plane, and which of them are bounded/unbounded?

A question that occurred to me is whether or not such a representation is unique, namely could there exist some different $p',q'$ such that $p'+q'\cos(\tfrac \pi{18})$ is equal to the same value. If this were to occur, then we could write $$\cos \left(\frac \pi{18} \right)=\frac{p-p^{\prime}}{q^{\prime}-q}=\frac{\left(p-p^{\prime} \right) \left(q+q^{\prime} \right)}{q^{{\prime}^{2}}-q^2}$$ .

10,Multiplicative Subsets of the Natural Numbers and Unique Factorization,Multiplicative Subsets of the Natural Numbers and Unique Factorization,,"Elementary number theory books often give as an example of non-unique factorization the set $S = \{4k+1: k \in \mathbb{N}\}$ . $S$ doesn't have unique factorization because $(3 \cdot{7})(11 \cdot {19}) = (3 \cdot{11})(7 \cdot{19})$ expresses $4389$ as the product of irreducibles (in $S$ ) in two different ways. The set $S$ is a multiplicative set (which I'll define shortly). My question is whether or not there is a necessary and sufficient condition for a multiplicative subset of the natural numbers to have unique factorization. Define a subset of the natural numbers to be multiplicative if (1) $1\in S$ , and (2) If $x \text{ and } y \in S, \text{ then } x \cdot{y} \in S$ . In the following, I'll use the word ""prime"" to mean one of the usual prime numbers. I'll use ""irreducible"" to refer to an element of a specific multiplicative subset of $\mathbb{N}$ that cannot be written as the product of two smaller elements of the set. A multiplicative subset of $\mathbb{N}$ will be said to have unique factorization if all of the elements of the set (other than 1) can be written as the product of irreducible elements in an essentially unique way (all irreducibles appear in the product the same number of times, possibly in a different order). Otherwise, the set will be said to have non-unique factorization. Multiplicative subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ other than the set $S$ defined above may not have unique factorization. For example, let $T = \{n \in \mathbb{N} : n \text{ is composite}\}$ . Then $4$ , $6$ and $9$ are all irreducible in $T$ (since they can't be written as a product of composites). However, $4 \cdot{9} = 6 \cdot{6}$ , expresses $36$ as the product of irreducibles in two different ways. Another such example is the set $\{1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, \dots\}$ . In this multiplicative set, $2^2 \text{ and }2^3$ are irreducibles, but $2^2 \cdot{2^2} \cdot{2^2} = 2^3 \cdot{2^3}$ expresses $64$ as the product of irreducibles in two different ways. On the other hand, there are plenty of multiplicative subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ that do have unique factorization. For example, if $\mathcal{P}$ is any set of prime numbers (finite or infinite), then the multiplicative set generated by all products of elements from $\mathcal{P}$ has unique factorization. Another example is $\{n \in \mathbb{N}: n \text{ can be written as the sum of two squares of positive integers}\}$ . This set is multiplicative by the identity $(n^2+m^2)(u^2+v^2) = (nu+mv)^2+ (nv-mu)^2$ , Its irreducibles are $\{2\}$ $\cup$ $\{p: p\equiv 1 \pmod4\}$ $\cup$ $\{q^2: q\equiv 3 \pmod4\}$ . I can show that this multiplicative set has unique factorization (in short, the result follows from unique factorization in $\mathbb{N}$ and since no irreducible contains two different prime factors). I realize that these multiplicative sets are monoids and that there are extensive results about factorization in monoids. However, I searched the Internet for results about my question and couldn't find anything. So, the questions stands: Are there any necessary and sufficient conditions for a multiplicative subset of $\mathbb{N}$ to have unique (or non-unique) factorization. Thanks in advance for any advice. Please let me know if I need to clarify any of the above. (Apologies in advance if my { and } in set definitions aren't rendering in Mathjax.

14,Why are the reflection groups $H_r(a; b)$ and $H_r(da; db)$ naturally isomorphic?,Why are the reflection groups  and  naturally isomorphic?,H_r(a; b) H_r(da; db),"I have a question about the following remark 5.6 of this article , I'm reading right now. I try to give a little pretext, with the notations used in the paper: Definition 5.2: Let $H(a; b) \in GL(n, \mathbb{C})$ be a hypergeometric group with parameters $a_1, ..., a_n, ; b_1 ..... b_n$ , and generators $h_0, h_1, h_{\infty}$ as in Definition 3.1. The subgroup $H_r(a;b)$ of $H(a;b)$ generated by the reflections $h_{\infty}^k h_1 h_{\infty}^{-k}$ for $k\in \mathbb{Z}$ is called  reflection subgroup of $H(a; b)$ . Definition 5.5: A scalar shift of the hypergeometric group $H (a; b)$ is a hypergeometric group $H (da; db)= H (da_1, ..., da_n ; db_1, ..., db_n)$ for some $d\in \mathbb{C}^*$ . Remark 5.6: If $d$ has the form $d=exp(2\pi i \delta)$ for some $\delta \in \mathbb{C}$ then a scalar shift from $H(a; b)$ to $H(da; db)$ is the effect on the monodromy group obtained by multiplying all solutions of the hypergeometric equation by $z^{-\delta}$ . Observe that the associated reflection groups $H_r(a; b)$ and $H_r(da; db)$ are naturally isomorphic. My question and what i have done so far: As said before, my question is about remark 5.6, or to be more precise, about the ""second"" part, regarding the natural isomorphism. I still want to at least explain my progress on the first part of 5.6 so far: First note, that the monodromy group of a hypergeometric equation $D(\alpha;\beta)u=0$ is a hypergeometric group $H(a;b)$ with parameters $a_j=exp(2 \pi i \alpha_j)$ and $b_j = exp(2 \pi i \beta_j)$ , according to proposition 3.2. Here the complex numbers $\alpha_j$ , $\beta_j$ are obtained via the local exponents of the solutions of said equation around $z=0,\infty$ . Also note, that $exp(2 \pi i \alpha_j)$ , $j=1,...,n$ are the eigenvalues of $h_{\infty}$ and $exp(-2 \pi i \beta_j)$ are the eigenvalues of $h_0$ respectively. I do understand, that if $d$ is of the form as in the remark, then the scalar shift is the effect on the monodromy group, by multiplying the solutions with $z^{-\delta}$ . This can be calculated fairily easy, by using that as in (2.9) the solutions are of the form $z^{1-\beta_i} {}_n F_{n-1}(...)$ . More precisely, by doing so we get local exponents $1-\beta_i-\delta$ in $z=0$ and $\alpha_i + \delta$ in $z=\infty$ respectively. Hence, we obtain a hypergeometric group $H(\tilde{a};\tilde{b})$ with parameters $$\tilde{a_i} = exp(2 \pi i(\alpha_i + \delta)) = exp(2 \pi i \delta)exp(2 \pi i \alpha_i) = d a_i,$$ $$\tilde{b_i} = exp(2 \pi i(\beta_i + \delta)) = exp(2 \pi i \delta)exp(2 \pi i \beta_i) = d b_i.$$ So as stated before, my remaining question now is: Why are the associated reflection subgroups naturally isomorphic in this case? * Edit: Bounty expires in one day!","I have a question about the following remark 5.6 of this article , I'm reading right now.

Attempt 2 : (Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence) Taking $G=C_m \times C_n$ and $H=C_n$ , we have the convergent spectral sequence $$ \mathcal{E}: E_2^{p,q} = H^p(C_m, H^q(C_n, \mathbb{Z})) \Rightarrow H^{p+q}(C_m \times C_m, \mathbb{Z}). $$ Since $G$ is an abelian group and $\mathbb{Z}$ is a trivial module, the conjugation actions of $G/H \cong C_m$ on the cohomology groups $H^q(C_n, \mathbb{Z})$ are trivial. So we explicitly compute the $E_2$ -page as $$ \begin{matrix}  \mathbb{Z}/n & 0 & \mathbb{Z}/d & 0 & \mathbb{Z}/d & \cdots \\  0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots \\  \mathbb{Z}/n & 0 & \mathbb{Z}/d & 0 & \mathbb{Z}/d & \cdots \\  0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots \\ E_2^{0,0}=\mathbb{Z} & 0 & \mathbb{Z}/m & 0 & \mathbb{Z}/m & \cdots \\ \end{matrix} $$ Then $E_{\infty}^{p,q} = E_{2}^{p,q}$ by carefully checking the direction of arrows. Then we know directly: $H^0(C_m \times C_n, \mathbb{Z}) = \mathbb{Z}$ , $H^{\text{odd}}(C_m \times C_n, \mathbb{Z}) = 0$ . But for cohomology group of even degree, I can only obtain a filtration of the cohomology: $$ H^{2i}(C_m \times C_n, \mathbb{Z}) \supseteq \ast \supseteq \ast \cdots \supseteq \ast = 0 $$ where the subquotients are $\mathbb{Z}/m$ , $\mathbb{Z}/d$ for $(i-1)$ times and one $\mathbb{Z}/n$ . Then if everything splits , then $$ H^{2i}(C_m \times C_n, \mathbb{Z}) = \mathbb{Z}/m \oplus (\mathbb{Z}/d)^{i-1} \oplus \mathbb{Z}/n. $$ But how can I see the splitting of this filtration ? Attempt 3 : (Inflation-restriction exact sequence) Actually the inf-res sequence is derived from the above spectral sequence, yet I still tried to gain something from it. We can only use the $n=1$ version of the inf-res sequence, which gives $$ 0 \rightarrow H^1(C_n, \mathbb{Z}) \xrightarrow{\mathrm{inf}} H^1(C_m \times C_n, \mathbb{Z}) \xrightarrow{\mathrm{res}} H^1(C_m, \mathbb{Z})^{C_n} \xrightarrow{\mathrm{transgression}} H^2(C_n, \mathbb{Z}) \rightarrow \cdots. $$ This turns into $$ 0 \rightarrow 0 \xrightarrow{\mathrm{inf}} H^1(C_m \times C_n, \mathbb{Z}) \xrightarrow{\mathrm{res}} 0 \xrightarrow{\mathrm{transgression}} 0. $$ hence $$ H^1(C_m \times C_n, \mathbb{Z}) \cong 0. $$ This can be seen from the spectral sequence above.

I think I've solved this using elementary techniques but I want to make sure the solution works. Claim: The kernel is the principal ideal $(3x - 1)$ . Proof: Clearly $(3x - 1)$ is in the kernel. Conversely, suppose $f(1/3) = 0$ . Then $x - 1/3$ divides $f$ in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ so we may write $f = (x - 1/3)(C_0 + C_1x + \cdots C_n x^n)$ for $C_n \in \mathbb{Q}$ . To conclude, we show that all the $C_i \in 3\mathbb{Z}$ . Writing out the product, we see that $$f(x) = -\frac{1}{3}C_0 + \left(C_0 - \frac{1}{3}C_1 \right)x + \cdots + \left(C_{n - 1} - \frac{1}{3} C_n\right) x^n + C_nx^{n + 1}.$$ Since $f \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ , the coefficients are all integers so that $C_0 \in 3\mathbb{Z}$ and $$C_i - \frac{1}{3} C_{i + 1} \in \mathbb{Z}$$ for all $0 \leq i \leq n - 1$ . Now, if $C_i \in 3\mathbb{Z}$ then $C_{i + 1} \in 3\mathbb{Z}$ by the above identity.

Here $a$ is the smallest negative exponent of some prime $p$ in the representation of $x$ , while $b$ is the smallest positive exponent. For instance for $p=2$ , $v(9/4)$ = $v(1/4 + 2)$ = $(2,1)$ . However we allow infinite expansions too: We define a sequence as 'left-convergent' if for $\lim v_2(x_n - x_{n-1})$ the first tuple value approaches infinity, and likewise for 'right-convergent'. In other words, high positive or negative powers of a prime both converge to different zeros. And therefore we can write unconditionally convergent expressions of the form $\sum_{-\infty}^{\infty} p^n a_n$ where $a_n$ is between $0$ and $p-1$ . So we basically obtain real (base $p$ ) plus p-adic 'combined' numbers. The number zero can e.g. be represented as either: $\cdots 0.0 \cdots$ or $\cdots (p-1)(p-1)(p-1).(p-1)(p-1)(p-1) \cdots$ Since the latter is divisible by all factors of $p-1$ , for $p>2$ we aren't dealing with a field (at least by the usual definition) as there are zero divisors. Though I don't know what happens with $p=2$ ? Something like $\frac{1}{x}$ for $(x,p)=1$ will have multiple solutions. With the 'new' solutions corresponding to linear combinations of the real and p-adic solution. E.g. $\frac{1}{3}$ for $p=2$ has representations: $0.010101 \cdots$ (real) $\cdots 0101011;$ (2-adic) $\cdots 010101.1010101 \cdots$ (sum of both divided by two) This sort of feels like 'field extension' since we are adding new solutions to an equation. In these numbers, series like $\displaystyle \sum_{n=0} p^{(-1)^n n}$ converge to finite values. Also power series converge absurdly: $\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x^n = 0$ for all $x$ with a power of $p$ in the numerator or denominator. How about products? (responding to Julian Rosen). In general we can use Cauchy products if at least one of the numbers has a finite representation. However multiplying an infinite p-adic and infinite real number together causes convergence issues. If we denote $\frac{1}{x}_p$ and $\frac{1}{x}$ for the p-adic and real representatives of a fraction. Then $\frac{1}{x}_p \cdot \frac{1}{x} = \frac{1}{x}_p \cdot \frac{x}{x^2} = \frac{1}{x^2} = \frac{x}{x^2}_p \cdot \frac{1}{x} =  \frac{1}{x^2}_p$ . Hence by implication there can't be a 'single' representative for this product. My questions are: Does this approach make sense/does it have a name? Does it have any benefits or unique advantages? E.g. tying p-adic results to real ones? For instance 'hypothetically' if we can demonstrate that the 'combined' expression (real + p-adic) is irrational and the real solution is rational, then the remaining term must be irrational.","So most p-adic notes inevitably beat us with a club with Ostrowski's theorem on absolute values.

Let $\beta \in F(\alpha) \setminus F$ such that $\beta$ is algebraic over $F$ . Then $\exists p(x) \in F[x], p(x) \neq 0$ such that $p(\beta) = 0$ . We then write $p(x)$ as follows $$p(x) = a_{0} + a_{1}x + \cdot\cdot\cdot + a_{n}x^{n}, a_{i} \in F.$$ Applying the evaluation homomorphism $\phi_{\beta}: F[x] \to E,$ $$p(\beta) = 0 = a_{0} + a_{1}\beta + \cdot\cdot\cdot + a_{n}\beta^{n}.$$ Since $\beta \in F(\alpha) \setminus F$ , $\beta = \frac{q(\alpha)}{r(\alpha)}$ $\exists q(x), r(x) \in F[x]$ (please see question 1). Thus $$a_{0} + a_{1}\beta + \cdot\cdot\cdot + a_{n}\beta^{n} = a_{0} + a_{1}(\frac{q(\alpha)}{r(\alpha)}) + \cdot\cdot\cdot + a_{n}(\frac{q(\alpha)}{r(\alpha)})^{n}.$$ Multiplying both sides with $(r(\alpha))^{n},$ $$(r(\alpha))^{n} (a_{0} + a_{1}(\frac{q(\alpha)}{r(\alpha)}) + \cdot\cdot\cdot + a_{n}(\frac{q(\alpha)}{r(\alpha)})^{n}) = a_{0}(r(\alpha))^{n} + a_{1}q(\alpha)(r(\alpha))^{n-1} + \cdot\cdot\cdot + a_{n}(q(\alpha))^{n} = 0.$$ Thus we found a polynomial $g(x) \in F[x] \setminus \{0\}$ such that $g(\alpha) = 0$ , contrary to the assumption that $\alpha$ is transcendental over $F$ .

36,$\Bbb Z\left [\frac{-1+\sqrt{-19}}{2}\right ]$ is not a Euclidean domain,is not a Euclidean domain,\Bbb Z\left [\frac{-1+\sqrt{-19}}{2}\right ],"Definition : A universal side divisor, is an element $s\in R\setminus R^\times$ such that for every $x\in R$ either $s\mid x$ , or there is some unit $u\in R^\times$ such that $s\mid x+u$ . Fact : A Euclidean domain $R$ has universal side divisors. Proof : Let $s$ be a non unit of minimal norm $N(s)$ . Let $x\in R$ and write $$x=sq+r$$ Then either $r=0$ , and so $s\mid x$ , or $N(r)<N(s)$ . But since $N(s)$ is minimal we must have $r$ a unit, so $s\mid x-r$ . Thus $s$ is a universal side divisor. I'm doing the following excercises: Suppose $R=\Bbb Z[\alpha]$ , where $\alpha=\frac{-1+\sqrt{-19}}{2}$ . Prove that $R$ is not a Euclidean domain by showing that it has no universal side divisors. a) Find the units of $R$ . b) Take the usual norm $N$ on $R$ , $N(z)=z\bar z$ . Show that the only elements of norm less than $5$ are $\{0,\pm 1,\pm 2\}$ . c) Taking $x=2$ in the definiton of a universal side divisor, show that any universal side divisor must be a non-unit divisor of $2$ or $3$ . d) Find all non-unit divisors of $2$ and $3$ . e) Now taking $x=\alpha$ in the definition of a universal side divisor, find a contradiction. What I would like to know is: Is my proof correct? Why is the step b) needed? Here we go: a) Find the units of $R$ . Let $N(a+b\alpha)=a^2-ab+5b^2=1$ , there are two cases to consider: $a\geq b$ , then $1\geq 5b^2$ , so $b=0$ and $a=1$ $b\geq a$ , then $1\geq a^2+4b^2$ , so again $b=0$ and $a=-1$ . Thus the only units are $\pm 1$ . b) Take the usual norm $N$ on $R$ , $N(z)=z\bar z$ . Show that the only elements of norm less than $5$ are $\{0,\pm 1,\pm 2\}$ . Again, there are two cases to consider: $a\geq b$ , then $5>a^2-ab+5b^2\geq 5b^2$ , so $b=0$ , and $a=0,1,2$ $b\geq a$ , then $5>a^2-ab+5b^2\geq a^2+4b^2$ , so $b=0$ , and $a=0,-1,-2$ Thus the elements $0,\pm 1, \pm 2$ is the only elements with norm less than $5$ . c) Taking $x=2$ in the definiton of a universal side divisor, show that any universal side divisor must be a non-unit divisor of $2$ or $3$ . Since $R^\times=\{\pm 1\}$ a universal side divisor $s$ must divide one of $2, (2+1), (2-1)$ . Since $s$ is not a unit, we must have $s\mid 2$ or $s\mid 3$ . d) Find all non-unit divisors of $2$ and $3$ . Both $2,3$ are irreducible in $R$ . To see this assume that $N(2)=N(x)N(y)=4$ , and $N(3)=N(z)N(w)=9$ . Is is then enough to show that $N(x),N(y)\neq 2$ and $N(z),N(w)\neq 3$ . There are again two cases: If $a\geq b$ , then $a^2+4b^2\geq 2,3\geq 5b^2$ , and so $b=0$ and $a^2=2,3$ , which is impossible. If $b\geq a$ , then $5b^2\geq 2,3\geq a^2+4b^2$ , and so $b=0$ . Contradiction. So both $2,3$ are irreducible. e) Now taking $x=\alpha$ in the definition of a universal side divisor, find a contradiction. If $R$ is a Euclidean domain, then there is a universal side divisor $s$ such that $s\mid 2$ or $s\mid 3$ . As both $2,3$ are irreducible we have $s=\pm 2,\pm 3$ . Therefore $N(s)=4,9$ . Also $s$ divides one of $\alpha,\alpha-1,\alpha+1$ . Computing norms we have: $N(\alpha)=5$ $N(\alpha+1)=5$ $N(\alpha-1)=6$ As $4$ or $9$ divides none of them, we must have that $s$ doesn't divide any of $\alpha,\alpha-1,\alpha+1$ . Contradiction.

Prove that $R$ is commutative (and thus $R$ is a field). Note: I do so without invoking Wedderburn's Theorem, that every finite division ring is a field. Also, within the context of this text, Rings must include unity. Proof Assume towards a contradiction that $R$ is not commutative. Then it's center, $C$ , is a proper subring of $R$ . Now, since $|R| = p^2$ , $|C| = p$ , as subrings are also subgroups and thus by Lagrange's Theorem $|C|$ must divide $|R|$ . Notice that since $0_R, 1_R \in C$ , $|C| > 1$ . Now, let $r \in R, r \not \in C$ be arbitrary. Notice that the centralizer of $r$ contains both $r$ and $C$ , as r commutes with itself and the center is the intersection of all centralizers.

Fields The irreducible finite reflection groups over $\mathbb{C}$ (also called unitary or complex reflection groups ) were classified by Shephard and Todd. The classification consists essentially of: An infinite family $G(m,p,n)$ of groups of rank $n$ , where $p$ divides $m$ , with slightly different properties when $m=p=1$ or when $n=1$ (these two cases are almost always listed independently).

These include the exceptional Coxeter groups $E_6, E_7, E_8, F_4, H_3, H_4$ . If $\mathbb{K}$ is a field of characteristic $0$ , it is known (see e.g. Section 15-2 here ) that if a group has a representation as a $\mathbb{K}$ -reflection group then it also has a representation as a complex reflection group, so we get no new examples for fields.

For abelian groups this problem is quite simple. All such abelian groups are exactly $C_{p^3}$ and $C_{pq}$ for any primes $p$ and $q$ : Suppose $P$ and $Q$ are abelian groups of coprime order. Then if $P \times Q$ satisfies that condition, then $\pi(P)|Q|^2 \leq \pi(P \times Q) = |P \times Q|^2 = |P|^2|Q|^2$ and thus $\pi(P) \leq |P|^2$ . So, to solve the problem we need to obtain the classification of all finite abelian $P$ -groups, satisfying the condition $\pi(P) \leq |P|^2$ . Suppose, a finite abelian $p$ -group $P$ is a direct product of $n$ cyclic groups. Then it contains a subgroup isomorphic to $C_p^n$ . So $\pi(P) \geq \pi(C_p^n) = \Pi_{k = 0}^n (p^k)^{C_n^k} = p^{\Sigma_{k = 0}^n kC_n^k} = p^{n2^{n-1}} > |P|^2$ for any $n > 1$ . So $P$ has to be cyclic. For cyclic $p$ -groups $P$ we can see $\pi({C_{p^n}}) = p^{\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}$ . So, the group satisfies our condition iff $\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \leq 2n$ which is exactly, when $n \leq 3$ . Now one can also see that $\pi(C_{p^2q}) = p^6q^3 \geq |\pi(C_{p^2q})|^2$ and $\pi(C_{pqr}) = (pqr)^3 \geq |\pi(C_{pqr})|^2$ for any prime $p$ , $q$ and $r$ . So, only possible examples are of one of the following forms: $C_{p^3}$ , $C_{p^2}$ , $C_{p}$ , $E$ , $C_{pq}$ .

Now, if $f, g \in \Sigma$ , define $$(f \ast g) (G)= \Sigma_{H \triangleleft G} f(H)g(\frac{G}{H}).$$ It is not hard to see, that $(\Sigma, \ast)$ is a group: $f \ast (g \ast h) = \Sigma_{K \triangleleft H \triangleleft G} f(K)g(\frac{H}{K})h(\frac{G}{H}) = (f \ast g) \ast h$ The function $e$ , such that $e(E) = 1$ and $e(G) = 0$ for any non-trivial $G$ , is the identity element. The inverse to $f$ is the function $f^{-1}$ satisfying the recurrent relation $\Sigma_{H \triangleleft G} f(H)f^{-1}(\frac{G}{H}) = 0$ and $f^{-1}(E) = 1$ .

That means $\forall n \in \mathbb(N)  f^n \neq e$ Personally, I think that this group is also very likely to be centerless, but the only thing I managed to prove in this direction was «If $f \in Z(\Sigma)$ and $G$ is simple, then $f(G) = 0$ »: Define $g_H \in \Sigma$ as a function, such that $g(H) = 1$ and $G(K) = 0$ for all non-trivial groups $K$ non-isomorphic to $H$ .

Applying this to the field $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_p$ , it follows that there exists an ordered subfield $R\subseteq \mathbb{Q}_p$ such that the extension is algebraic. The field $\mathbb{Q}_p$ cannot be ordered itself (as $-1$ is a sum of squares), it follows that $R\subseteq \mathbb{Q}_p$ is a strict extension. However, $\mathbb{Q}_p$ has no nontrivial endomorphisms, so the extension cannot be normal. Are there any explicit constructions for $R$ ?

First of all, many people know the typical quantum group $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ by generators and relations. This thing is often called a $q$-deformation of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$. The first baby question is whether anyone can give a more general definition of what a $q$-deformation is without generators and relations. Immediately I want to give two remarks: People wrongly call the quantized universal enveloping algebras $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ where $\mathfrak{g}$ is a finite-dimensional complex semi-simple Lie algebra, Drinfeld-Jimbo algebras. Why do I say that this is wrong? Well, the algebras $U_h(\mathfrak{g})$ defined in a similar fashion are the real Drinfeld-Jimbo algebras. In chapter XVIII of 'Quantum Groups' by Kassel, he defines $h$-deformations. Moreover, there are rigidity-results for these algebras. One can truly say that a Drinfeld-Jimbo algebra is the unique quantization of the underlying Lie algebra in very precise sense (again see Kassel's book). In fact, the Drinfeld-Jimbo algebras have a nice categorical interpretation (see corollary XIX.4.3 of his book). Many people often claim that these rigidity results hold for the $q$-deformations as well. I have yet to see a proof of such claims! Moreover, I believe that people often claim this because they refer to both $q$ and $h$-deformations as Drinfeld-Jimbo algebras. This explains my wrongly . Assuming that these results are easily copied to $q$-setting is not a good hope. The $h$-rigidty results depend on the fact that $h$-deformations $U_h(\mathfrak{g})$ have a quasi-triangular structure. This is simply not true for $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$. (Categorically this correspond to the representation category of $U_h(\mathfrak{g})$ having a braiding whereas $U_g(\mathfrak{g})$-Mod is not braided). With these considerations in mind, any reasonable definition of a $q$-deformation must be seriously different than the one with generators and relations. Indeed, one can only talk about rigidity meaningfully if $q$-deformations aren't intrinsically uniquely defined (specifying generators and relations tells you what the object is, uniquely).

Definition: A factorization for $n \in D$ is a finite multiset $S$ of irreducible elements such that $n \sim \prod S$. Definition: Two factorizations $S$ and $T$ for $n \in D$ are equivalent if there exists a bijection $f : S \to T$ such that $p \sim f(p)$ for every $p \in S$.

Definition: A unique factorization domain is a domain such that every nonzero element admits a unique factorization up to equivalence.

Take nonzero elements $p,a,b \in D$ such that $p$ is irreducible and $p \mid ab$. There exists a nonzero element $h \in D$ such that $hp = ab$. Let $H,A,B$ be factorizations for $h,a,b$, respectively. Hence $\prod H \cdot p \sim \prod A \cdot \prod B$. By the unique factorization property there exists a bijection $f : H \sqcup \{p\} \to A \sqcup B$ such that $q \sim f(q)$ are associates for every $q \in H \sqcup \{p\}$. In particular, either $f(p) \in A$ or $f(p) \in B$. In the former case, $p \sim f(p) \mid \prod A \sim a$. In the latter case, $p \sim f(p) \mid \prod B \sim b$. Hence $p$ is prime. Conversely, assume every irreducible element of $D$ is prime. Let $S$ and $T$ be factorizations of a common element. By induction on the cardinality of $S$, we have two cases: If $S = \emptyset$, then $\prod S = 1$, hence $\prod T \in D^*$, hence $T = \emptyset$. If $p \in S$, then $p \mid \prod T$. Since $p$ is prime, there exists $q \in T$ such that $p \mid q$. Since $q$ is irreducible, $p \sim q$. Let $S' = S \setminus \{p\}$ and $T' = T \setminus \{q\}$. Then $p \cdot \prod S' \sim q \cdot \prod T'$. By the inductive hypothesis, $S'$ and $T'$ are equivalent, hence so are $S$ and $T$.","Today in algebra class my professor proved, among other things, that a factorization domain is a unique factorization domain if and only if every irreducible element is prime.

Let $H,A,B$ be factorizations for $h,a,b$, respectively. Hence $\prod H \cdot p \sim \prod A \cdot \prod B$. By the unique factorization property there exists a bijection $f : H \sqcup \{p\} \to A \sqcup B$ such that $q \sim f(q)$ are associates for every $q \in H \sqcup \{p\}$. In particular, either $f(p) \in A$ or $f(p) \in B$. In the former case, $p \sim f(p) \mid \prod A \sim a$. In the latter case, $p \sim f(p) \mid \prod B \sim b$. Hence $p$ is prime. Conversely, assume every irreducible element of $D$ is prime. Let $S$ and $T$ be factorizations of a common element. By induction on the cardinality of $S$, we have two cases: If $S = \emptyset$, then $\prod S = 1$, hence $\prod T \in D^*$, hence $T = \emptyset$. If $p \in S$, then $p \mid \prod T$. Since $p$ is prime, there exists $q \in T$ such that $p \mid q$. Since $q$ is irreducible, $p \sim q$. Let $S' = S \setminus \{p\}$ and $T' = T \setminus \{q\}$. Then $p \cdot \prod S' \sim q \cdot \prod T'$. By the inductive hypothesis, $S'$ and $T'$ are equivalent, hence so are $S$ and $T$.",,"['abstract-algebra', 'ring-theory', 'proof-writing']"

89,Maximal real subfields of Cyclotomic subfields giving rise to identities,Maximal real subfields of Cyclotomic subfields giving rise to identities,,"When fiddling a bit with cyclotomic fields, I discovered the following: If $f(X)=X^3+X^2-2X-1$ is the minimal polynomial for $\eta=\zeta_7+\zeta_7^{-1}$ over $\mathbb Q$, then $f(X^2-2)+f(X)f(-X)=0.$ This is natural, of course, since the Galois Group of  $\mathbb Q(\zeta_7+\zeta_7^{-1})/\mathbb Q$ is generated by $\sigma(\zeta_7)=\zeta_7^2$ and then $\sigma(\eta)=\eta^2-2$. This then led me to consider the polynomial equation $$P(X^2-2)=\pm P(X)P(-X),\ P\in\mathbb Q[x].$$ Let us call the set of solutions $V$. It is obvious that if $f(X),g(X)\in V$, then $f(X)g(X)\in V.$  (also it is obvious that if a polynomial fits the conditions, then its leading coefficient is 1 or -1). Let $P(X)=f_1(X)...f_m(X)\in V$, where the $f_i$ are (not necessarily distinct) irreducibles. Since they are irreducible (i.e. prime), each of them must divide at least one factor on the LHS: $$f_{a_1}(X)\mid f_{a_2}(X^2-2)$$ for some (perhaps equal) $a_1$ and $a_2$. Denoting $\tau(X)=X^2-2$, we can apply this a finite number of times until we arrive at the original polynomial(this is not entirely true, but since we are cycling through a finite number of polynomials, repetition is bound to happen.We are just going to assume f_a_1 is one that repeats) $$f_{a_1}(X)\mid f_{a_2}(\tau(X))$$ $$f_{a_2}(X)\mid f_{a_3}(\tau(X))$$ $\hspace{80 mm}$ .......... $$f_{a_k}(X)\mid f_{a_1}(\tau(X))$$ Therefore  $$f_{a_1}(X)\mid f_{a_2}(\tau(X))$$ $$f_{a_2}(\tau(X))\mid f_{a_3}(\tau^2(X))$$ $\hspace{80 mm}$ .......... $$f_{a_k}(\tau^{k-1}(X)\mid f_{a_1}(\tau^k(X))$$ This means that $f_{a_1}(X)\mid f_{a_1}(\tau^k(X))$. Let $\alpha$ be a root. We know that $\tau^k(\alpha)$ is also a root of $f_{a_1}(X)$ by the divisibility. Therefore $\tau^k$ is an automorphism of $\mathbb Q(\alpha)$, because $\mathbb Q(\alpha) \simeq\mathbb Q[X]/f(X) \simeq\mathbb Q(\tau^k(\alpha))$ (this works because $f_{a_1}(X)$ is irreducible). Now consider the quadratic polynomial $X^2-\alpha X+1$ and let the roots of it be $\eta$ and $\eta^{-1}$, so $\alpha=\eta+\eta^{-1}$ and $\mathbb Q(\eta)\supset\mathbb Q(\alpha) \supset\mathbb Q$.Extend the automorphism $\tau^k$ to an automorphism of $\mathbb Q(\eta)$ and keep the notation. Now, applying $\tau^k$to the quadratic we have  $$X^2-\tau^k(\alpha)X+1=(X-\tau^k(\eta))(X-\tau^k(\eta^{-1}))=(X-\eta^{2^k})(X-\eta^{-2^k}),$$ because $$(\eta+\eta^{-1})^2-2=\eta^2+\eta^{-2};(\eta^2+\eta^{-2})^2-2=\eta^4+\eta^{-4}$$ and so on. This means that an automorphism of $\mathbb Q(\eta)$ maps $\eta$ to $\eta^{\pm2^k},$ which means that $\eta$ is a root of unity! Therefore $f_{a_1}(X)$ is the minimal polynomial of $\zeta_n+\zeta_n^{-1}$ over $\mathbb Q$, for some $n$.But since $\zeta_n \rightarrow \zeta_n^{\pm2^k}$ is an automorphism, n must be odd. Conversely, let $f(X)$be the minimal polynomial over Q for $\zeta_n+\zeta_n^{-1}$, where n is odd.Then the roots of $f(X^2-2)$ should be $\pm \sqrt{2+\zeta_n^k+\zeta_n^{-k}},$ where k ranges over the integers (k,n)=1.But since n is odd, we have a j such that $2j\equiv k(n).$ Therefore, the roots of $f(X^2-2)$ are $$\pm \sqrt{2+\zeta_n^{2i}+\zeta_n^{-2i}}=\pm \sqrt{(\zeta_n^i+\zeta_n^{-i})^2}=\pm (\zeta_n^i+\zeta_n^{-i}),$$ which are exactly the roots of $f(X)$ and $f(-X)$.But all of these polynomials have leading coefficients plus or minus 1, and the degrees agree, so $f(X^2-2)=\pm f(X)f(-X)$.So the set V is exactly $\pm  \langle f_n(x), n\in 2N+1 \rangle,$ ranging over the minimal polynomials mentioned.
