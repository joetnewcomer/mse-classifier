39,Find an equivalence relation over all of $\mathbb{Z}$ which has infinitely many equivalence classes with infinitely many elements in each,Find an equivalence relation over all of  which has infinitely many equivalence classes with infinitely many elements in each,\mathbb{Z},"I want to find an equivalence relation defined on all integers (that is, all of $\mathbb{Z}$ ) where The equivalence relation partitions $\mathbb{Z}$ into infinitely many equivalence classes; and Every equivalence class contains an infinite number of elements. I've been thinking about this interesting question for a while, and I have come up with two ideas which are close, but not complete solutions. My first idea was to define the equivalence relation $\sim$ where $x \sim y \iff x = \pm p^m, y = \pm p^n$ for some prime number $p$ , and some integers $m, n$ . This will certainly create infinitely many equivalence classes where each equivalence class will essentially contain all powers of one prime number (positive or negative). Since there are infinitely many prime numbers, there will be infinitely many equivalence classes, and each equivalence class will contain infinitely many elements. However, there are two problems with this idea: firstly, $1$ and $-1$ , which are equal to $\pm p^0$ for all prime numbers $p$ , will be in all of the equivalence classes. Secondly, $0$ will need to be placed in an equivalence class by itself, which does not satisfy the condition that every equivalence class must contain an infinite number of elements. My second idea was to say that two integers $x$ and $y$ a are equivalent iff the largest power of $2$ that divides them is the same. Essentially, I say that $x$ and $y$ are equivalent iff the number of zeroes at the end of their binary expansion is the same. However, this fails to account for the number $0$ ; we cannot place $0$ into an unique equivalence class because that would fail to satisfy the condition that every equivalence class must contain an infinite number of elements.

Can a metric   function $d_X$ on a set $X$ attain exactly three distinct values? Going through the route of actually finding a metric instead of disproving one exists, I tried finding a metric which has values $0$, $a$ and $b$. But by trying to define it in a similar way as the discrete metric, I had a hard time finding one that could satisfy the three requirements to be a metric. Disproving it on the other hand sounds pretty easy tho, by just taking $x, y, z \in X$, I set the two values to random distances like $d_X(x, y) = a = d_X(y,x)$ , $d_X(x, z) = b = d_X(z, x)$ and finally $d_X(y, z) = c = d_X(z, y)$, with $c$ being either $a$ or $b$. Applying this to the triangle inequality gives us. $d_X(x, z) \leq d_X(x, y) + d_X(y,z)$ $d_X(x, y) \leq d_X(x, z) + d_X(z,y)$ $d_X(y, z) \leq d_X(y, x) + d_X(x,z)$ Which gives us the linear inequalities: $b \leq a + c$ $a \leq b + c$ $c \leq a + b$ This cannot hold if $c$ is either $a$ or $b$. Is this proof correct? And more importantly, isn't there a better proof, because this sounds like a very inefficient proof.","The discrete metric $d_0$ can take two values $0$ and $1$. Can a metric   function $d_X$ on a set $X$ attain exactly three distinct values? Going through the route of actually finding a metric instead of disproving one exists, I tried finding a metric which has values $0$, $a$ and $b$. But by trying to define it in a similar way as the discrete metric, I had a hard time finding one that could satisfy the three requirements to be a metric. Disproving it on the other hand sounds pretty easy tho, by just taking $x, y, z \in X$, I set the two values to random distances like $d_X(x, y) = a = d_X(y,x)$ , $d_X(x, z) = b = d_X(z, x)$ and finally $d_X(y, z) = c = d_X(z, y)$, with $c$ being either $a$ or $b$. Applying this to the triangle inequality gives us. $d_X(x, z) \leq d_X(x, y) + d_X(y,z)$ $d_X(x, y) \leq d_X(x, z) + d_X(z,y)$ $d_X(y, z) \leq d_X(y, x) + d_X(x,z)$ Which gives us the linear inequalities: $b \leq a + c$ $a \leq b + c$ $c \leq a + b$ This cannot hold if $c$ is either $a$ or $b$. Is this proof correct? And more importantly, isn't there a better proof, because this sounds like a very inefficient proof.",,"['discrete-mathematics', 'metric-spaces']"
