EDIT Ok, so this is how I proceeded to prove this convergence based on vanna's answer. Please tell me if I am wrong anywhere. First I show that the sequence is increasing  $$x_n -x_m = \frac{\sqrt n -\sqrt m}{\sqrt{mn} +\sqrt m + \sqrt n + 1} \gt 0 \qquad\forall n\gt m$$ I will now show that it is bounded $$n\lt n+\sqrt n \implies x_n \lt 1 \quad\forall n \in \mathbb{N} $$ By the Least Upper Bound Property there exists a Least Upper Bound $L$ for the sequence $\{x_n\}$ since is it bounded. Since L is the least upper bound, $$\exists x_k \in \{x_n\} \mid x_k \in (L-\epsilon, L]  \; \;\forall \epsilon \gt 0\;$$ or else there will exist another number  $$L-\frac{\epsilon }{2}$$  such that  $$\forall k \in \mathbb{N} \quad x_k\le L-\frac {\epsilon }{2}$$ but this is contradiction as $L$ is the least upper bound. Hence  $$\quad \forall \epsilon \gt 0 \quad\exists k \in \mathbb{N}\; \; \mid  x_k \in (L-\epsilon, L]$$ Now since $\{ x_n\} $ is monotonically increasing sequence and bounded by $L$ , $$\;\forall i \ge k \;,x_i \in (L-\epsilon, L]$$  Hence  $$\forall \epsilon\ge 0, \; \exists k\in \mathbb{N} \; \mid \; |x_i-L| \lt \epsilon$$  And thus we proved that the series converges and it converges to it's Least Upper Bound.

I prove that the sequence is eventually decreasing and that it is bounded below (see work below). Hence, if my work is correct, the sequence will have a limit. The problem is that if the limit is, say, $L$ then it should satisfy $L=\frac{L+2L}{3}$; however, every real number satisfies the latter equality. So, if this limit exists, how do I actually find it? Proving the limit exists: 1) The sequence is bounded below by $1$. Base Case: $x_1=1\ge 1$. Induction: Suppose $x_n\ge 1$ for all $k=1,\ldots ,n+1$. Then $x_{n+2}=\frac{x_{n+1}+2x_{n}}{3}\ge \frac{3}{3}=1$. 2) The sequence is eventually decreasing: It actually starts decreasing after the 4th term. So I take as my base case $x_5<x_4$. Base Case: Note that $$x_3=\frac{x_2+2x_1}{3}=\frac{3+2}{3}=5/3$$ and hence $$x_4=\frac{x_{3}+2x_{2}}{3}=\frac{5/3+2\times3}{3}=23/9$$ so $$x_5=\frac{x_{4}+2x_{3}}{3}=\frac{23/9+2\times5/3}{3}=\frac{53}{27}<x_4$$ Induction: Suppose $x_{n}<x_{n-1}.$ Then $$x_{n+1}-x_n=\frac{x_{n}+2x_{n-1}}{3}-x_n \\=2\frac{x_{n-1}-x_n}{3}<0$$ Therefore, the sequence is bounded below and is eventually decreasing.","Define $\lbrace x_n \rbrace$ by $$x_1=1, x_2=3; x_{n+2}=\frac{x_{n+1}+2x_{n}}{3} \text{if} \, n\ge 1$$ The instructions are to determine if this sequence exists and to find the limit if it exists. I prove that the sequence is eventually decreasing and that it is bounded below (see work below). Hence, if my work is correct, the sequence will have a limit. The problem is that if the limit is, say, $L$ then it should satisfy $L=\frac{L+2L}{3}$; however, every real number satisfies the latter equality. So, if this limit exists, how do I actually find it?
