Then $dx = -\frac{1}{t^2}\,dt$. Then the integral converts to $$ -\int \frac{t^3}{(1+t^4)^{3/4}}\,dt $$ Now Let $(1+t^4) = u$. Then $t^3\,dt = \frac{1}{4}du$. This changes the integral to $$ \begin{align} -\frac{1}{4}\int t^{-3/4}\,dt &= -u^{1/4}+\mathcal{C}\\ &= -\left(1+t^4\right)^{1/4}+\mathcal{C} \end{align} $$ So we arrive at the solution $$\int\frac{1}{x^2\left(x^4+1\right)^{3/4}}\,dx = - \left(\frac{1+x^4}{x^4}\right)^{1/4}+\mathcal{C.}$$ Question: Is there any other method for solving this problem?",,"['calculus', 'integration', 'indefinite-integrals']"
