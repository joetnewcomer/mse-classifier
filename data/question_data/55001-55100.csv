Here $\{x\}=x-\lfloor x\rfloor$ is the fractional part of $x$. Questions very similar to this have been asked in the past. For example Multiples of an irrational number forming a dense subset However right now I can't adjust them and put the two sticks together. Context I was trying to prove the following proposition --- which isn't actually true when $n>2$. Let $n>2$ and let $O_n$ be the (proper) subset of $[0,1]$ of irrational numbers containing only $0$s and $1$s in their base-$n$ expansion. If we take $\alpha\in O_n$ we then have that $$\{n^N\alpha\}\in O_n\text{ for all }N\in\mathbb{N}$$ and so $S$ can not be dense in $[0,1]$ when $n>2$. Proposition Suppose that $f:\mathbb{C}\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}$ is a power mapping $f(z)=z^n$ for some $n\geq 2$. Then the dynamical system $(\mathbb{C},f)$ exhibits the following four behaviours: If $z_0\in\mathbb{D}:=\{z\in\mathbb{C}:|z|<1\}$ then $z_n\rightarrow 0$. If $z_0\in\mathbb{C}\backslash\bar{\mathbb{D}}:=\{z\in\mathbb{Z}:|z|>1\}$ then $z_n\rightarrow\infty$. If $z_0\in\mathbb{T}=\{z\in\mathbb{C}:|z|=1\}$ then there are two behaviours: a. If $z_0=e^{q\,2\pi i}$ with $q\in\mathbb{Q}$ then $z_0$ is eventually periodic. b. If $z_0=e^{\alpha\,2\pi i}$ with $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}\backslash\mathbb{Q}$ then $z_0$ has a dense orbit. In fact, $(\mathbb{T},f)$ is a chaotic mapping. Proof: 1, 2 and the first part of 3 were illustrated in class for $n=4$. Here we prove for a general $n\geq 2$. Assume that $z_0=e^{\alpha\cdot\,2\pi i}$ with $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}\backslash \mathbb{Q}$ Claim 1: $z_0$ is not eventually periodic. Proof by Contradiction :  Suppose that $z_0=e^{\alpha\cdot2\pi i}$ is eventually periodic. That is there exists an iterate of $z_0$, say $f^N(z_0)$, that is periodic. Note that $$f^N(z_0)=z_0^{n^N}=\left(e^{\alpha\cdot 2\pi i}\right)^{n^N}=e^{n^N\alpha\cdot2\pi i}.$$ Now if this point is periodic then there exists an $M\geq 1$ such that $$f^M(e^{n^N\alpha\cdot2\pi i})=e^{n^N\alpha\cdot2\pi i}$$ $$\Rightarrow e^{n^Nn^M\alpha\cdot2\pi i}=e^{n^N \alpha\cdot2\pi i}$$ If these two complex numbers are equal then their argument/angle must differ only by a multiple of $360^\circ$; i.e. $k\cdot 2\pi$ for $k\in\mathbb{Z}$: $$n^{M}n^N\alpha\cdot 2\pi-n^N\alpha\cdot 2\pi=k\cdot 2\pi$$ $$\Rightarrow n^{N+M}\alpha-n^N\alpha=k$$ $$\displaystyle\alpha=\frac{k}{n^{N+M}-n^N},$$ but this is a contradiction as $\alpha$ is not a fraction. Hence $z_0$ is not eventually periodic $\bullet$ Claim 2: Two iterates of $z_0$ can be found that are arbitrarily close together. Proof : Note that the length of the unit circle is $2\pi$. Suppose that we divide the unit circle into $N$ arcs $A_1,A_2,\dots,A_N$ each of equal length $\displaystyle \frac{2\pi}{N}$ (to be careful suppose that they contain their 'right' endpoints but not their 'left'). Now, we know that $z_0$ is not eventually periodic so the first $n$ iterates of $z_0$ are all distinct: $$z_0,z_1,z_2,z_3,\dots,z_N.$$ Note that there are $N$ arcs but $N+1$ iterates so by the Pigeonhole Principle there is an arc $A_i$ containing two iterates of $z_0$ --- say $z_i$ and $z_j$ --- that are on the same arc. Take $N\rightarrow \infty$ so that the arcs becoming arbitrarily small and the points become arbitrarily close together $\bullet$ Claim 3: There is a number $M$ such that $z_0$ and $f^M(z_0)$ are arbitrarily close together.

Below are some observations about the question. Observation 1: The right hand side of (1) is known as (an example of a) Lambert series . For $q=1/2$ it is equal to Erdős–Borwein constant ( A065442 ). Observation 2. Numerical evidence: According to numerical evaluation lhs and rhs of (1) match up to $10^{-16}$ . According to Wolfram Mathematica lhs and rhs of (2) match (as series in $q$ ) modulo $q^{1001}$ . Observation 3. Equivalent statements: The following statements are equivalent (thus, you can prove any one of these to answer the question). Equation (1) is true for all $q\in\mathbb{C}$ s.t. $\left|q\right| < 1$ .

I would like to know an elementary proof of the same. Before proceeding let me define all the necessary terms and symbolism to set the proper context. Let $\tau$ be a complex number with positive imaginary part and $q=\exp(2\pi i\tau) $ so that $|q|<1$ . Below I define functions and the relations which I am aware of. The Rogers-Ramanujan continued fraction is given by $$R(q) =\cfrac{q^{1/5}}{1+\cfrac{q}{1+\cfrac{q^2}{1+\cfrac{q^3}{1+\dots}}}}\tag{1}$$ Ramanujan studied this function in great detail and obtained the following fundamental identities $$\frac{1}{R(q)}-1-R(q)=\frac{\eta(q^{1/5})} {\eta(q^5)}\tag{2}$$ and $$\frac{1}{R^5(q)}-11-R^5(q)=\left(\frac{\eta(q)}{\eta(q^5)}\right)^6\tag{3}$$ where $\eta(q) $ is Dedekind eta function defined by $$\eta(q) =q^{1/24}\prod_{n=1}^{\infty} (1-q^n)\tag{4}$$ To define the $j$ -invariant we need to introduce Ramanujan's version of Eisenstein series denoted by $L, M, N$ (symbols $P, Q, R$ are typically used but we want to avoid conflict with Rogers-Ramanujan continued fraction $R(q) $ ) \begin{align} L(q) &= 1-24\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{nq^n}{1-q^n}\tag{5a}\\ M(q)&=1+240\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{n^3q^n}{1-q^n}\tag{5b}\\ N(q) &=1-504\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{n^5q^n}{1-q^n}\tag{5c} \end{align} It should be observed that $L$ is related to $\eta$ via $$L(q) =24q\frac{d}{dq}(\log\eta(q))\tag{6}$$ The $j$ -invariant is defined as $$j(q) =\frac{1728M^3(q)}{M^3(q)-N^2(q)}\tag{7}$$ Ramanujan obtained a system of differential equations connecting $L, M, N$ : \begin{align} q\frac{dL(q) } {dq} &=\frac{L^2(q)-M(q)}{12}\tag{8a}\\ q\frac{dM(q)}{dq}&=\frac{L(q)M(q)-N(q)}{3}\tag{8b}\\ q\frac{dN(q)} {dq} &=\frac{L(q) N(q) - M^2(q)}{2}\tag{8c} \end{align} Using $(6)$ and $(8a)$ it is evident that $M(q) $ can also be expressed in terms of $\eta(q) $ . On the other hand the above differential equations allow us to prove that $$M^3(q)-N^2(q)=1728\eta^{24}(q)\tag{9}$$ and thus we have some expression for $j(q) $ in terms of $\eta(q) $ . The following complicated relation holds between Rogers Ramanujan continued fraction $R(q)$ and $j(q) $ : $$ R^5 (R^{10}+11 R^5-1)^5j+(R^{20}-228 R^{15}+494 R^{10}+228 R^5+1)^3 = 0\tag{10}$$ I checked Wikipedia and found that this is derived from another identity $$j(q) =\frac{(x^2+10x+5)^3} {x} \tag{11}$$ where $$x=125\left(\frac {\eta(q^5)}{\eta(q)}\right)^6\tag{12}$$ Using $(11),(12)$ and $(3)$ we can deduce $(10)$ with a little algebra. Thus the problem boils down to a proof of equation $(11)$ . I don't know if this can be derived using algebraic manipulation of the identities given above or does it need some specific modular equation. Any proofs or suggestions for proof are welcome. I don't understand the machinery of modular forms properly and would prefer an approach more in the spirit of Ramanujan.

Questions But from here I don't know if I am right, how to conclude and solve the converse part to say that we have a non zero limit, and another thing Can someone provide explicit examples of a sequence of complex numbers $\{a_n\}$ such that  $\sum a_n$ converges but $\prod (1+a_n)$ diverges and the other way around (This is $\prod (1+a_n)$ converges but $\sum a_n$ diverges )? Thanks a lot in advance.","We assume that $\sum |a_n|^{2}$ converges, then I want to conclude that $\prod (1+a_n)$ converges to a non zero element $\iff$ the series $\sum a_n$ converges. My attempt If $\prod (1+a_n)$ converges to a non zero element then we can write $$\prod (1+a_n)= \prod \exp(\ln(1+a_n))= \exp(\sum \ln (1+a_n)) \le \exp(\sum |\ln (1+a_n)|)$$ Then using that $\sum |a_n|^{2}$ converges we can choose $n$ such that $|a_n|^2 < \frac{1}{4}$ and we know that $|ln(1+z)|\le 2 |z|$ if $|z|< \frac{1}{2}$ using the series expansion, we get that $$\exp(\sum |\ln (1+a_n)|) \le \exp(\sum 2|a_n|)$$ For the converse I want to use the result that says that if $\sum |a_n|$ converges then $\prod (1+a_n)$ converges so since we have that $\sum |a_n|^{2}$ converges then $\sum |a_n|$ converges and  $\prod (1+a_n)$ does too.
