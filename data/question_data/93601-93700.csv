17,Proof of Casorati-Weierstrass?,Proof of Casorati-Weierstrass?,,"In Stein's Complex Analysis, he presents the following statement and proof of Casorati-Weierstrass: Suppose $f$ is holomorphic in the punctured disc $D_r(z_0) - \{z_0\}$ and has an essential singularity at $z_0$. Then, the image of $d_r(z_0) - \{z_0\}$ under $f$ is dense in the complex plane. Proof: We argue by contradiction. Assume that the range of $f$ is not dense, so that there exists $w \in \mathbb{C}$ and $\delta > 0$ such that $$|f(z) - w| > \delta$$ for all $z \in D_r(z_0) - \{z_0\}$. We may therefore define a new function on $D_r(z_0) - \{z_0\}$ by $$g(z) = \frac{1}{f(z) - w}$$ which is holomorphic on the punctured disc and bounded by $1/\delta$. Hence, $g$ has a removable singularity at $z_0$. Statement 1: If $g(z_0) \neq 0$, then $f(z) - w$ is holomorphic at $z_0$, which contradicts the assumption that $z_0$ is an essential singularity. Statement 2: In the case that $g(z_0) = 0$, then $f(z) - w$ has a pole at $z_0$ also contradicting the nature of the singularity at $z_0$. The proof is complete. My Question: In regards to statement 1, why precisely is this true? I can rewrite $g(z) = \frac{1}{f(z) - w}$ as $f(z) - w = \frac{1}{g(z)}$, and if $g(z_0) \neq 0$, then $f(z_0) - w$ is defined -- does it immediately follow that $f(z_0)$ is holomorphic at $z_0$?","In Stein's Complex Analysis, he presents the following statement and proof of Casorati-Weierstrass: Suppose $f$ is holomorphic in the punctured disc $D_r(z_0) - \{z_0\}$ and has an essential singularity at $z_0$. Then, the image of $d_r(z_0) - \{z_0\}$ under $f$ is dense in the complex plane. Proof: We argue by contradiction. Assume that the range of $f$ is not dense, so that there exists $w \in \mathbb{C}$ and $\delta > 0$ such that $$|f(z) - w| > \delta$$ for all $z \in D_r(z_0) - \{z_0\}$. We may therefore define a new function on $D_r(z_0) - \{z_0\}$ by $$g(z) = \frac{1}{f(z) - w}$$ which is holomorphic on the punctured disc and bounded by $1/\delta$. Hence, $g$ has a removable singularity at $z_0$. Statement 1: If $g(z_0) \neq 0$, then $f(z) - w$ is holomorphic at $z_0$, which contradicts the assumption that $z_0$ is an essential singularity. Statement 2: In the case that $g(z_0) = 0$, then $f(z) - w$ has a pole at $z_0$ also contradicting the nature of the singularity at $z_0$. The proof is complete. My Question: In regards to statement 1, why precisely is this true? I can rewrite $g(z) = \frac{1}{f(z) - w}$ as $f(z) - w = \frac{1}{g(z)}$, and if $g(z_0) \neq 0$, then $f(z_0) - w$ is defined -- does it immediately follow that $f(z_0)$ is holomorphic at $z_0$?",,['complex-analysis']

Improve this question I am not sure if the closed- form of this limit is known ( is the imaginary one): If it's not, then yay, I found it. But I think it's very unlikely that it's not already known, as with anything else I've found out. Edit: All right, I just checked the answer with the Polygamma on Mathematica, and it doesn't give it a closed-form, but I do have and am adding it here. Please don't vandalize the rating of this post otherwise I won't be able to add the details. Edit: Attending to the request of the mods, I want to clarify that the question is about if a closed-form for the below was already known (see my answer for the real part):",i \lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{1}{(a i k+b)^2} \Re\left(\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{k=1}^n\frac1{(aik+b)^2}\right)=-\frac1{2b^2}+\frac1{2(1-e^{-2\pi b/a})^2}\left(\frac{2\pi}a\right)^2e^{-2\pi b/a} \lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{j=1}^{n}\frac{1}{(a i j k+b)^k},['complex-analysis']

What should I do to get something out?","I am to evaluate $\displaystyle\int_0^{\infty} \dfrac{\sin x}{x(x^2+1)}dx$ via contour integration. Now I used an indented semicircular contour, and the parts lying on the real line and the big arc were no problem, but the small arc is being resistant, and I'm not sure what to do. Usually, on the small arc from $-\varepsilon$ to $\varepsilon$ I can take a laurent expansion of the integrand, and consider integrating its principle part over the arc, letting the rest go to zero in the limit $\varepsilon \to 0$ as the ""holomorphic part"". My issue is this particular integrand doesn't have a principle part... The end result is $\dfrac{(e-1)\pi}{2e}$, and so far I have the integral over the whole contour as $\dfrac{-\pi i}{e}$ (I'm not sure why this came out imaginary..) so this part is going to have to contribute something.

Then we know by Cauchy's integral theorem that $\int_\gamma \frac{1}{z^2}\mathrm{d}z=0$ for every appropriate closed curve $\gamma$, such that its interior doesn't contain $0$. When $\gamma$ interior contains $0$ we can show that $\forall \gamma \,\,\exists r$, such that $$\int_{\gamma}f(z)\mathrm{d}z=\int_{|z|=r}f(z)\mathrm{d}z\,,$$ provided that the whole circle bounded by $|z|=r$ lays inside the interior of $\gamma$.

As the function $f(z)$ suffices assumptions we can apply Morera's theorem, which implies $f(z)$ is holomorphic on $\mathbb{C}$. That's a contradiction.
