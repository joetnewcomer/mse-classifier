The order of objects inside their box or the order of boxes do not matter :  $\begin{array}{|l|l|} \hline \circ\bullet & \bullet \\ \hline \end{array} =  \begin{array}{|l|l|} \hline \bullet & \circ\bullet \\ \hline \end{array}$ The only way I found to solve this was to generate all partitions, filter them and finally count the elements. This is impracticable when $n$ or $p$ increase. Is there a way to count the possibilities without enumerating them ? Example : There are 7 ways in which $\{\circ,\circ,\circ,\circ,\bullet,\bullet\}$ can be distributed in 4 boxes. $ \begin{array}{|l|l|l|l|} \hline \varnothing  & \circ      & \circ\circ        & \circ\bullet\bullet        \\ \hline \varnothing  & \circ      & \circ\circ\circ & \bullet\bullet               \\ \hline \varnothing  & \circ      & \bullet               & \circ\circ\circ\bullet \\ \hline \varnothing  & \circ      & \circ\bullet        & \circ\circ\bullet        \\ \hline \varnothing  & \bullet      & \circ\circ        & \circ\circ\bullet        \\ \hline \varnothing  & \bullet      & \circ\bullet        & \circ\circ\circ        \\ \hline \circ      & \bullet      & \circ\circ        & \circ\bullet               \\ \hline \end{array} $ Edit : Ignoring the ""one box can be empty""-condition and if all objects are distinct, this is solved with the Stirling number of 2 nd kind $\lbrace{n\atop k}\rbrace$.

2,Ordering people with friendship constraints,Ordering people with friendship constraints,,"$n$ people have to be ordered in a line, one after the other. We say that: A person X sees a person Y, if X stands behind Y. A person X hears a person Y, if X stands at most $k$ positions in front of Y. Each person has two friends (friendship relation is not symmetric). An order is good if each person either sees or hears both his/her friends What is the largest value of $n$ (as a function of $k$) for which a good order always exists? Here are some examples. When $n\leq k+1$, a good order always exists, since each person can see or hear all other people. When $k=1$ and $n\geq k+2$, a good order never exists, since the front person sees nobody and hears at most a single friend. When $k=2$ and $n=4$. a good order always exists and can be found as follows. Put an arbitrary person (e.g. Alice) in the front. Put her two friends just behind her, so that she can hear both of them. Put the fourth person at the back. When $k=2$ and $n=5$, things are getting interesting. Suppose we put Alice in the front, and her friends are Bob and Carl. So the order has to start as either Alice-Bob-Carl or Alice-Carl-Bob. But, if Bob's friends are David and Eva and Carl's friends are also David and Eva, then one of them (the one just behind Alice) will not hear both his friends. We can try to put Bob at the front, then David and Eva. But, if both David's friends and Eva's friends are Alice and Carl, then one of them (the one just behind Bob) will not hear both his friends. In that case, we can order the agents as: Carl-David-Eva-Alice-Bob; this order satisfies all the requirements. Apparently, finding a good order becomes harder when $n$ is larger. Hence the question. UPDATE 1: when $n\leq 2k$, a good order always exists. Put an arbitrary agent (say, Alice) in the front. Put one of her friends (say, Bob) just behind her. Put one of Bob's friends (say, Carl) just behind him. Continue like this until $k$ people are placed. Then, at position $k+1$, put Alice's second friend (if not already placed). At position $k+2$, put Bob's second friend (if not already placed), and so on. So the people at positions $1,\dots,k$ can hear all their friends. Since $n\leq 2k$, the people at positions $k+1,\dots,2k$ can hear everyone behind them. Hence the order is good. This seems very not tight, since we just picked the front person arbitrarily. Surely we can do better by picking the front person more carefully, right? UPDATE 2: Based on Kevin's probabilistic argument, I tried the following counting argument. The friendship relation can be roughly represented by a vector of size $2n$. For each 2 positions in the vector, there are $(n-1)(n-2)$ options, so the total number of vectors is $\approx n^{2n}$. On the other hand, the total number of orderings is $n!$. Therefore, if we could prove that each order is good for less than $n^{2n} / n!$ vectors, then this would imply that some vectors have no good orders. Unfortunately, the latter claim is probably not true. Fix an order, and renumber the agents such that the order is $1,\dots,n$. To construct a vector for which this order is good, we have $k(k-1)$ options for the friends of person 1, $(k+1)k$ options for the friends of person 2, ..., $(n-2)(n-1)$ options for the friends of person $n-k$, and $(n-2)(n-1)$ options for the friends of the remaining people $n-k,\dots,n$. Multiplying all these numbers gives much more than $n^{2n} / n!$. So this counting argument does not work. UPDATE 3: This question is related: How many nodes do you need? If our friendship graph if $k$-dense (as defined in that question), then a good order does not exist. Proof: regardless of who we put in the first $k$ locations, these $k$ people have together $k+1$ friends besides themselves. So, one of these people will not hear one of his friends. So a lower bound of $n$ in that question implies an upper bound of $n-1$ in the current question. In particular, for $k=2$, there is a 2-dense graph with 7 nodes; hence the largest number of people for which a good order exists is at most 6 (Peter showed a better upper bound: 5).","$n$ people have to be ordered in a line, one after the other.

3,Largest consecutive integer using basic operations and optimal digits?,Largest consecutive integer using basic operations and optimal digits?,,"If you are first time reading this , you may want to read the summary section last. Solution summary and questions Sequence values If the allowed operations are $(+,-,\times,\div)$ and parentheses $(\space)$ , then the $f(n)$ is the number of consecutive integers we can make starting at $1$ , given $n$ ""digits"" that each needs to be used exactly once. Equivalently, it is the largest integer we can make such that all smaller integers $\in\mathbb N$ can be made as well. The $d$ is (optimal?) digit set used, where $d=\{d_1,\dots,d_n\}=(d_1,\dots,d_n)\in\mathbb N^n$ . So far I have the following data given $n=1,\dots,5$ digits to use (best so far): \begin{array}{ccccccc} n & 1&2&3&4&5&6\\ f(n)& 1 & 3 & 10 & 52 & 351 & ? \\ d & \{1\} & \{1, 2\} & \{1, 2, 4\} & \{2, 3, 4, 22\} & \{3, 6, 8, 12, 37\} & ?  \end{array} The $1,3,10$ are optimal. The $52$ entry is probably optimal, but I'm not sure if this can be proven. The $f(5)\ge 351$ can be obtained using $\{3, 6, 8, 12, 37\}$ . I don't think it can be better. Notice the weird similarity to the $A052446$ sequence. Pure coincidence? $Q_1$ : Is there any reason to suspect $f(4)=52,f(5)=351$ aren't the optimal solutions? I haven't computed $f(n)$ for $n\ge6$ significatnly, I do not know how to do it efficiently. There is a similar sequence such that $A142153(n-1)$ $\approx f(n)$ . The main difference being that linked sequence does not require all digits to be used when building a single number, giving it more freedom and expected larger terms than my sequence. The offset $(n-1)$ is due to it starting at $n=0$ . $Q_2$ : Can we find (compute) significant (lower bounds) $f_d(n)$ for $n\ge 6$ ? I've found so far $f_d(6)\ge 2200$ using $d=\{2, 10, 13, 30, 49, 56\}$ . This was done with a simple c++ search checking random digit sets: run it on repl.it . I want to thank user TheSimpliFire for helping me run the code for $f(6)$ . - The goal was to reach $f(6)\gt 3000$ if possible, but it looks hard unless the search can be optimized. Lower bound ""Weak"" lower exponential bound is known: $f(n)\gt 2^{n/3}$ . This is based on a related problem that allows only $1$ 's and $(+,\times)$ . - ""Complexity of $n$ "". This can be imporoved: We can using $d=\{1,2,4,\dots,2^{n-1}\}$ , show that the following lower bounds hold: $f(n)\ge 2^n-1,n\ge 1$ , which confirms optimal $f(1),f(2)=1,3$ . $f(n)\ge 2^n+2,n\ge 3$ , which confirms optimal $f(3)=10$ . $f(n)\ge 2^n+10,n\ge 4$ , which gives sub-optimal $f(4)\ge26$ . Twice less than $f(4)=52$ . These bounds not hard to construct since this $d$ set has nice inductive properties. But I haven't noticed a pattern that can be generalized to all $n$ . It looks hard. The best we can do with this set $d=\{d_i=2^{i-1},i=1,\dots,n\}$ of digits is: $$f(n)\ge f_{d}(n)= 2^n-1+g(k)$$ where $g(k)=0,0,3,11,45,533\dots$ for $n\ge k$ where $k=1,2,3,4,5,6,\dots$ $Q_3:$ The $2^n$ grows slower than $g(k)$ , for large $n$ . Can we demystify $g(k)$ in terms of $n$ ? Equivalently, What is the smallest number that can't be made using powers of two? Seems $f_d(n)=2^n+g(k)\ll f(n)$ for large $n$ for this $d=\{d_i=2^{i-1},i=1,\dots,n\}$ . Notice this $d$ is optimal for $n\le 3$ . Can we find better digit sets for $n\ge 4$ ? $Q_4:$ What's a better set $d$ for which we can show higher lower bounds, in terms of on $n\ge 4$ ? Problem Up to how many consecutive integers $\in\mathbb N$ , can be made using only the four basic   operations: $+$ addition, $-$ subtraction, $\times$ multiplication, $\div$ division Given $n$ numbers (""digits"") as building blocks, if parentheses are allowed? The goal is to build all integers from $1$ to $N$ , while maximizing $N$ , for given $n$ amount of digits. We are given $d\in\mathbb N^n$ natural numbers (""digits"") to work with. We define $f_d(n)$ as maximal $N$ reachable using digits $d$ , and $f(n)$ as maximal $f_d(n)$ , given $n$ . Example Lets take $n=4,f_d(4)$ for example. We can try using $d=\{4,4,4,4\}$ four fours, \begin{array}{} 1 &= (4 + 4 - 4) \div 4 \\ 2 &= 4 - ((4 + 4) \div 4)  \\ 3 &= (4 + 4 + 4) \div 4 \\ 4 &= ((4 - 4) \times 4) + 4 \\ 5 &= ((4\times4)+4)\div4 \\ 6 &= ((4 + 4) \div 4) + 4 \\ 7 &= 4 - (4\div4 - 4) \\ 8 &= (4 + 4 + 4) - 4\\ 9 &= (4\div4 + 4) + 4 \end{array} And see that $f_{\{4,4,4,4\}}(4)=9$ , because if you try hard enough, $10$ can't be made! This means that $f(4)\ge f_d(4)= 9$ is at least nine. We probably need a better set of digits $d$ to use, to make $10$ and beyond. Definitions The digit set $d$ allows duplicate digits, and exactly $n$ digits ( elements ), and all digits ( elements ) must be used exactly once . Given a fixed set of $n$ digits $d=\{d_1,\dots,d_n\}$ , we can construct consecutive integers from $1$ to $N\in\mathbb N$ using the basic operations and parentheses, but we can't construct $N+1$ . Then we define the value $f_d(n)=N$ . Then we can define $f(n)=\max f_d(n)=N_{\text{max}}$ , for $d\in\mathbb N^n$ . That is, maximized $N$ obtained by using the optimal set of digits $d=\{d_1,\dots,d_n\}$ for a given case of using $n$ digits. How to efficiently calculate, practically prove, $f(n)$ for given $n$ ? The sets of digits are not ordered, so naturally: WLOG we can assume $d_1\le d_2\le \dots \le d_n\implies d_n=\max\{d_1,\dots,d_n\}$ . Keep this in mind. Clarifications All integers $1,2,3,\dots,N$ must be constructed ; Using all digits from digit set $d$ exactly once. ""Concatenation"" is not allowed . That is, combining digits like $\{1,1\}$ to make $11$ is forbidden. We are after optimal $d=\{d_1,\dots,d_n\}$ that will allow us to construct the longest such sequence by applying the basic operations $+,-,\times,\div$ to the given digit set, when talking about maximal $N$ . Solving small cases Cases $n=1,2$ Trivially, $f(1)=1$ for $d=\{1\}$ , since we can't apply binary operations to a single digit. It can be easily seen that $f(2)=3$ is best, using optimal digits set $d=\{1,2\}$ , here: $$\begin{array}{} 1 &= 2 - 1 \\ 2 &= 2 \times 1 \\ 3 &= 2 + 1 \\ \end{array}$$ This is optimal: Since if we are given $d=\{d_1,d_2\}$ , if not $d_2-d_1=1$ or not $d_1=d_2$ , we can't make $1$ , thus $f_d(2)=0$ in these $d$ cases. And we can't make $2$ unless they either add up to two, differ by two, or one is two times other. The only case that also extends to $3$ , is the $d=\{1,2\}$ making this $f(2)=3$ proof easy. Case $n=3$ It can be shown $f(3)=10$ if you observe enough cases. It can be seen that $f_d(3)= 3$ at best, if $d_3$ is too large. I have checked the rest (small enough) cases computationally. The optimal set is $d=\{1,2,4\}$ and the solutions can be seen below: $$\begin{array}{} 1 = 4 - (1 + 2) \\ 2 = 4 - (1 \times 2) \\ 3 = (1 - 2) + 4 \\ 4 = (2 - 1) \times 4 \\ 5 = 4 - (1 - 2) \\ 6 = (1 \times 2) + 4 \\ 7 = (1 + 2) + 4 \\ 8 = (1 \times 2) \times 4 \\ 9 = 1 + (2 \times 4) \\ 10 = (1 + 4) \times 2 \\ \end{array}$$ Case $n=4$ The $f(4)=52$ is a conjectured solution, using $d=\{2,3,4,22\}$ . The previous records are $f_{\{1, 2, 5, 6\}}(4)=43, f_{\{1, 2, 5, 8\}}(4)=51$ . I have checked all $d_4\lt 64$ , and tabulated maximal $N=y$ for subsets of digits such that $d_4=x$ : Is it possible to prove $f(4)=52$ ? Update: I extended the calculations to $d_4\le 100$ and the $52$ indeed seems to be optimal. A similar problem to $f(4)$ , but roots and exponentiation are allowed, was asked . Computing larger cases Cases $n\ge 5$ Is it possible to set up bounds or make progress in calculating these cases? If not, can we optimize the computation? I'm running a brute force search. For this result, all sets of digits with $d_5\le 15$ have been checked with record being $f_{\{2, 8, 9, 12, 13\}}=271$ . But this is going on too slow in my python code to extend further. (Code based on this four fours solver .) So I've decided to not brute force all sets, but try ones with $d_1,d_2=1,2$ or $d_1,d_2=2,3$ and $d_3\le d_4/2$ , for $d_5\ge 20$ . I've reached $d_5=45$ so far, with these restrictions on $d_1,d_2,d_3$ . This is where $f_{\{2, 3, 7, 8, 38\}}=324$ was found: seen solutions . Update: I've implemented the search in c++ which is faster now. I've checked all digits up to $d_5 \le 35$ so far, where the best was $f(5)=333$ . I've also checked a restricted search where $d_5\le 120$ but $d_4\le 12$ so far, which is where the newest $f(5)=351$ was found. I've also checked a restricted search where $d_5\le 60$ but $d_4\le 24$ so far,  with no better results. Growth of $f(n)$ ? Can we analyse and give bounds on growth of $f(n)$ ? The best I have so far is: using $d_i=2^{i-1}$ to show $f(n)\gt 2^n,n\gt 2$ . Here is ""weak"" linear bound (explicit construction) example to get inspired: Weak linear lower bound (explicitly constructive) For $d$ , we pick $\{1,\dots,1\}$ all $1$ 's. We can then make $1,\dots,2n-4$ easily: $$\begin{array}{} 1 &= (1+1)-(1\times1\times\dots\times 1) &= 2 - 1\\ 2 &= (1+1)\times(1\times1\times\dots\times 1) &= 2 \times 1\\ 3 &= (1+1)+(1\times1\times\dots\times 1) &= 2 + 1\\ 4 &= (1+1)+1+(1\times1\times\dots\times 1) &= 2 + 1 + 1\\ \dots & & \\ n &= (1+1)+(1+1+1+\dots+ 1) &= 2 + (n-2) \\ n &= (1+1)\times(1+1)+(1+1+\dots+ 1) &= 2\cdot2 + (n-4) \\ n+1 &= (1+1)\times(1+1+1)+(1+\dots+ 1) &= 2\cdot3 + (n-5) \\ n+2 &= (1+1)\times(1+1+1+1)+(1+\dots+ 1) &= 2\cdot4 + (n-6) \\ \dots & & \\ 2n-4 &= (1+1)\times(1+1+1+\dots+ 1) &= 2(n-2) + (n-n) \end{array}$$ We have now shown $f(n)\ge 2n-4$ with this trivial digit set. Note that this works if we replace $(1+1)$ with $(d_n\div d_{n-1})$ if $d_{n-1}=d_n/2$ , so we also have an infinite family of digit sets that can achieve at least $2n-4$ , since $d_n\in\mathbb N$ can be any digit. Perhaps instead of $(1+1)$ , we can use this and pick $d_n/2=2n-3$ to continue the construction? Note that we could also replace other $1$ 's with similar substitutions and keep the initial construction still valid. Can we do better with this idea, and show it is better than exponential bound given below? This idea was discussed by user @Countingstuff in the comments (second-by-date comment). Exponential lower bound (based on a related problem) The bound is ""weak"" due to ignoring $(-,\div)$ operations, and due to using only $1$ 's as digits. Lets restrict the problem to only $(+,\times)$ operations, and define this restricted $\overline{f}(n)$ . We have: $$ f(n)\ge \overline{f}(n) $$ By definition. For $\overline{f_d}$ , optimal $d$ consists of pure $1$ 's, since otherwise, $N=1$ can't be made. Now this becomes related to the "" Complexity of natural number $n$ "" problem. That is, $a(N)$ - minimal number of $1$ 's for expressing $N$ using $1$ 's and $+,\times$ . Now, this has known bounds: $3\log_2N \ge a(N) \ge 3\log_3N$ , $\space$ [R. K. Guy, Unsolved Problems in Number Theory, Sect. F26.]. The upper bound is obtained by expanding $N$ in binary with Horner's algorithm. Improving the upper bound is still an open problem. We will use the upper bound for $a(N)$ to get the ""weak"" lower bound for $f(n)$ . If $N_0$ some number, notice that $a(N_0)$ defines the price of building $N_0$ , in terms of the amount of digits. And since the price $a(N)$ is bounded above by a monotone increasing function, if we can build $N_0$ with at least the bound given amount of digits, we can also build numbers $1,\dots, N_0$ with that many or less digits, thus $N\ge N_0$ . Also, an important fact is that if we can build $N_0$ with $n$ digits, we can build it with $\ge n$ digits as well. This is due to optimal $d$ being a set of $1$ 's for restricted $\overline{f_d}$ , so we can multiply two digits $1$ 's to reduce the case of digits, down to $n$ , for every case $\gt n$ . So, by the definition of $a(N)$ and $\overline{f}(n)$ we have: $$\begin{array}{} k(N)\ge a(N_0) \implies \overline{f}(k(N_0))\ge N_0 \\ \end{array}$$ So we can use the result on bounds of $a(N)$ to establish: $$ 3\log_2N_0 \ge a(N_0) \implies \overline{f}(3\log_2 N_0)\ge N_0 \implies \overline{f}(n)\ge 2^{n/3} $$ By substitution $n=3\log_2 N_0\implies N_0=2^{n/3}$ . We have obtained: An exponential lower bound for the original problem, $f(n)\ge 2^{n/3}$ follows from $f(n)\ge\overline{f}(n)$ . But note that $f(n)\gt 2^{n/3}$ it actually certainly strict. For example, last two digits can be $d_0,d_0$ where $d_0=\frac12 2^{(n-1)/3}$ . The $(d_0/d_0)=1$ leaves us with $n-1$ case of $1$ 's, so we can reach $2^{(n-1)/3}$ at least. Now use $(d_0+d_0)=2^{(n-1)/3}$ . Now we are left with $n-2$ case of $1$ 's free to use again. Which means we can reach at least $2^{(n-1)/3}+2^{(n-2)/3}\gt 2^{n/3},n\gt 3$ . I believe $f(n)\gg \overline{f}(x)\ge 2^{n/3}$ is actually much greater than this ""weak"" bound. Questions regarding bounds Can we improve this by getting a ""non-weak"", and better bound? - Perhaps use the fact that $(-,\div)$ allows extending the explicit weak linear construction I mentioned earlier? Can we obtain non-trivial upper bounds? A trivial upper bound can be the upper bound on number of (not necessarily consecutive) distinct positive integers that can be built with the given operations and $n$ digits. I'm not sure how I would establish a non-trivial upper bound. - Bound that uses the fact that integers are consecutive. Idea is to find upper bound on the ""hole"" that breaks the consecutive sequence?

Partial answers answering any point of this question are appreciated.","If you are first time reading this , you may want to read the summary section last.

Problem Up to how many consecutive integers , can be made using only the four basic   operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division Given numbers (""digits"") as building blocks, if parentheses are allowed? The goal is to build all integers from to , while maximizing , for given amount of digits. We are given natural numbers (""digits"") to work with. We define as maximal reachable using digits , and as maximal , given . Example Lets take for example. We can try using four fours, And see that , because if you try hard enough, can't be made! This means that is at least nine. We probably need a better set of digits to use, to make and beyond. Definitions The digit set allows duplicate digits, and exactly digits ( elements ), and all digits ( elements ) must be used exactly once . Given a fixed set of digits , we can construct consecutive integers from to using the basic operations and parentheses, but we can't construct . Then we define the value . Then we can define , for . That is, maximized obtained by using the optimal set of digits for a given case of using digits. How to efficiently calculate, practically prove, for given ? The sets of digits are not ordered, so naturally: WLOG we can assume . Keep this in mind. Clarifications All integers must be constructed ; Using all digits from digit set exactly once. ""Concatenation"" is not allowed . That is, combining digits like to make is forbidden. We are after optimal that will allow us to construct the longest such sequence by applying the basic operations to the given digit set, when talking about maximal . Solving small cases Cases Trivially, for , since we can't apply binary operations to a single digit. It can be easily seen that is best, using optimal digits set , here: This is optimal: Since if we are given , if not or not , we can't make , thus in these cases. And we can't make unless they either add up to two, differ by two, or one is two times other. The only case that also extends to , is the making this proof easy. Case It can be shown if you observe enough cases. It can be seen that at best, if is too large. I have checked the rest (small enough) cases computationally. The optimal set is and the solutions can be seen below: Case The is a conjectured solution, using . The previous records are . I have checked all , and tabulated maximal for subsets of digits such that : Is it possible to prove ? Update: I extended the calculations to and the indeed seems to be optimal. A similar problem to , but roots and exponentiation are allowed, was asked . Computing larger cases Cases Is it possible to set up bounds or make progress in calculating these cases?

33,Maximizing curious symmetric function from simple combinatorics,Maximizing curious symmetric function from simple combinatorics,,"A curious symmetric function crossed my way in some quantum mechanics calculations, and I'm interested its maximum value (for which I do have a conjecture). (This question has been posted at MathOverflow on 13.12.2014; the question has been solved in a very nice way there.) The problem There are $n$ different objects $A_1,...,A_n$, and there are sets containing $m$ different $A_i$s: $C_i=(A_{i_1}, A_{i_2}, ..., A_{i_m})$. There are $i_{max}=\binom{n}{m}$ different combinations $C_i$. Each combination $C_i$ has a probability $p_i$ (with $\sum_{i=1}^{i_{max}} p_i=1$). Defining the function For a given pair of objects $A_k$ and $A_l$: $f_1(k,l)$ contains all probabilities $p_i$ of the sets $C_i$, which contains both objects $A_k$ and $A_l$. $f_2(k,l)$ contains all probabilities $p_i$ of the sets $C_i$, which contains either object $A_k$ or $A_l$ (if it contains both elements, we add $p_i$ twice). $F(k,l)=\frac{f_1(k,l)}{f_2(k,l)}$ With that, we get the main-function $$D^{(n,m)}=\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \sum_{l=k+1}^{n} F(k,l)$$ What is the maximum of $D^{(n,m)}$, given that the sum of all probabilities $p_i$ is 1? Special cases n=2, m=2 This is a trivial case. We have two objects $A_1$ and $A_2$, and only one set of combinations $C_1=(A_1,A_2)$ with $p_1$. Thus $f_1(1,2)=p_1$, $f_2(1,2)=p_1+p_1$. This leads to $D^{(2,2)}=F(1,2)=\frac{1}{2}$. Every other case with $n=m$ can be solved easily by $D^{(n,m)}=\frac{1}{n}$ n=3, m=2 This case is simple (but not trivial) and I found a solution: We have n=3 objects $A_1$, $A_2$ and $A_3$, and combinations $C_i$ of m=2 objects $C_1$=($A_1$, $A_2$), $C_2$=($A_1$, $A_3$), $C_3$=($A_2$, $A_3$), with $p_1$, $p_2$, $p_3$ respectivly. For k=1, l=2 we have $f_1(1,2)=p_1$ (because only $C_1$ contains both $A_1$ and $A_2$), and $f_2(1,2)=2p_1+p_2+p_3$ (because $A_1$ is contained in $C_1$ and $C_2$ and $A_2$ is in $C_1$ and $C_3$). So we get $$D^{(3,2)}=F(1,2) + F(1,3) + F(2,3) = \frac{p_1}{2p_1+p_2+p_3} + \frac{p_2}{p_1+2p_2+p_3} + \frac{p_3}{p_1+p_2+2p_3}$$ A maximum can be found easily (due to normalisation of $p_1+p_2+p_3=1$): $$D^{(3,2)} = \frac{p_1}{1+p_1} + \frac{p_2}{1+p_2} + \frac{p_3}{1+p_3}$$ so each term can be maximized individually, which gives $D^{(3,2)}=\frac{3}{4}$ for $p_1=p_2=p_3$. n=4, m=2 We have four objects $A_1$, $A_2$, $A_3$, $A_4$, and six combinations $C_1=(A_1,A_2)$, $C_2=(A_1,A_3)$, ..., $C_6=(A_3, A_4)$. Therefore we get: $$D^{(4,2)} = \frac{p_1}{2p_1+p_2+p_3+p_4+p_5} + \frac{p_2}{p_1+2p_2+p_3+p_4+p_6} + \frac{p_3}{p_1+p_2+3p_3+p_5+p_6} + \frac{p_4}{p_1+p_2+2p_4+p_5+p_6} + \frac{p_5}{p_1+p_3+p_4+2p_5+p_6} + \frac{p_6}{p_2+p_3+p_4+p_5+2p_6}$$ I was not able to find a method for proving a global maximum. n=4, m=3 We have $C_1=(A_1,A_2,A_3)$, $C_2=(A_1,A_2,A_4)$, $C_3=(A_1,A_3,A_4)$, $C_4=(A_2,A_3,A_4)$, which gives $$D^{(4,3)}=\frac{p_1+p_2}{2p_1+2p_2+p_3+p_4}+\frac{p_1+p_3}{2p_1+p_2+2p_3+p_4}+\frac{p_1+p_4}{2p_1+p_2+p_3+2p_4}+\frac{p_2+p_3}{p_1+2p_2+2p_3+p_4}+\frac{p_2+p_4}{p_1+2p_2+p_3+2p_4}+\frac{p_3+p_4}{p_1+p_2+2p_3+2p_4}$$ This case can be simplified aswell, similar to $n=3,m=2$ case to $$D^{(4,3)}=\frac{p_1+p_2}{1+p_1+p_2}+\frac{p_1+p_3}{1+p_1+p_3}+\frac{p_1+p_4}{1+p_1+p_4}+\frac{p_2+p_3}{1+p_2+p_3}+\frac{p_2+p_4}{1+p_2+p_4}+\frac{p_3+p_4}{1+p_3+p_4}$$ but I'm not able to find any further method to calculate the maximum. Conjecture The two cases I solved had a maximum at equal $p_i=\frac{1}{\binom{n}{m}}$. Furthermore, the function $D^{(n,m)}$ is very symmetric, so I expect that the maximum is always at $p_1=p_2=...=p_i$. Numerical search up to n=7 confirms my expectation (but I'm not 100% sure about my Mathematica-based numerical maximization). Questions How can you prove (or disprove) that the maximum for $D^{(n,m)}$ for arbitrary $n$ and $m$ is always at $p_1=p_2=...=p_i$? Is there literature on similar problems or is this function even known? Has the similarity to the Shapiro inequality some significance or is it just a coincidence?

34,Signs of entries of Kravchuk matrices asymptotically produce a large circular region with hyperbolic sinks. Why?,Signs of entries of Kravchuk matrices asymptotically produce a large circular region with hyperbolic sinks. Why?,,"Crossposted on MathOverflow to investigate the sinks (Observation 2). Edit 2: I have now found the following paper Wolf and Krötzsch (2007): Geometry and dynamics in the fractional discrete Fourier transform where Figure 7 apparently shows the circle pattern. However, I am unsure whether the author explains why a circle is formed, since the mathematics/physics involved is currently beyond my understanding. If there is indeed a proof or exposition of this behaviour, I will accept any answer that clearly explains what is happening. Edit: I just learned that these are known as the Kravchuk matrices , which are heavily applied in quantum physics and signal processing. So it won't be a total surprise if the pattern I describe below is intrinsically linked to discrete Fourier transforms, for instance. However, I worked on the matrix for a different reason: it was developed due to this question on an involution for estimating $n$ th order derivatives. So I'm also interested in the deeper mathematical link between high-order derivative approximation and these matrices. Consider the square matrix $T^{(n+1)}$ such that its elements follow the formula below \begin{align}T^{(n+1)}_{i,j}&=(-1)^i\sum_{k=0}^i\binom ik\binom{n-k}j(-2)^k\quad\forall0\le i,j\le n.\end{align} This can be rewritten as $T^{(n+1)}_{i,j}=[x^j](1+x)^{n-i}(1-x)^i$ where $[x^j]$ denotes the coefficient of $x^j$ . By evaluating at $x=1$ , this means the sum of each row is zero, except the first row with sum $2^n$ . We describe an asymptotic plot of the sign of $T^{(n+1)}_{i,j}$ as odd $n\to\infty$ , where $i$ is the vertical axis and $j$ horizontal. Positive entries are filled orange and negative entries are filled white. Below is when $n=999$ . For reference, these are the plots for $n=499$ and $n=99$ . The pattern was unexpected to me. We observe the following: Asymptotically, there is a large circular region centred at $i=j=(n+1)/2$ whose pattern noticeably differs from the rest of the plot. Within this circle are numerous hyperbolic sinks of varying sizes. It appears that the largest sinks lie on the line $i=j$ , and the number of sinks tends to infinity asymptotically. Outside the circle, in the top-left quadrant, all elements of $T$ are positive. Outside the circle, in the top-right and bottom-left quadrants, the sign alternates between full rows and columns. Outside the circle, in the bottom-right quadrant, the sign appears to alternate by consecutive entries. Question: How do we explain Observations 1, 2, 3, 4, 5? Note: When $n$ is even, the plot is the same, with the addition of vertical and horizontal lines for zero entries which sometimes lie on the circumference of the circle as well.

Question: Has anyone ever seen these sequences before? And is there a combinatorial method to determine the multiplicity of an arbitrary element of $S_n$? A bit of background: One can show with a little geometry that the vector elements of $S_n$ and their multiplicities are actually the locations and brightnesses of the maxima of the following bivariate function: $$f_n(k_1,k_2)=\left|\int_{-\infty}^\infty dx\int_{-\infty}^\infty dy\mbox{ }e^{2\pi i(k_1x+k_2y)}\prod_{j=1}^ng\left[(1,0)\cdot R\left(\frac{2\pi j}{n}\right)\cdot(x,y)\right]\mbox{Cos}\left[(1,0)\cdot R\left(\frac{2\pi j}{n}\right)\cdot(x,y) \right]\right|$$ where $g$ is any slowly-varying ""structure factor"" function and $R(\theta)$ is the rotation matrix of angle $\theta$. For example, here is a plot of $\sqrt{f_{11}(k_1,k_2)}$: A larger and much more beautiful 2000 x 2000 pixel version is available here . The above image is essentially $S_{11}$, but convolved with the Fourier transform of the structure factor (I used $g$ to be a shifted Heaviside theta function $g(x)=\theta(c-x)$). The brightness channels of the image are saturated to show the finer details of the set. One can also make additional interesting pictures by replacing $\mbox{Cos}\left[(1,0)\cdot R\left(\frac{2\pi j}{n}\right)\cdot(x,y) \right]$ with more complicated frequency-modulated functions like  $\mbox{Cos}\left[z\mbox{ }\mbox{Cos}\left[(1,0)\cdot R\left(\frac{2\pi j}{n}\right)\cdot(x,y) \right]\right]$, which according to the Jacobi-Anger expansion will generate higher-order Bessel-weighted harmonics of the lattice, such as shown in the following image of $S_5$: The image has been computed using an FFT which was purposefully chosen to Nyquist alias the higher harmonics of $S_5$ into the picture frame, generating the constellation-like pattern seen there. Here is a slightly-larger 1000 x 1000 pixel version . And here's another interesting one, which I can't remember how I made, but which might not actually be a picture of an $S_n$ (I was doing random things at the time): A 2000 x 2000 pixel version is available here .

You have a swatter with a checkerboard pattern, much larger than the table. Show that there is always a way to position and orient the swatter to kill at least five of the flies. Each fly is much smaller than a swatter square and is killed if any portion of a black square hits any part of the fly. (Source: The 2017 UW Math Hour Olympiad ). My Problem Is it always possible to kill all $6$ flies? More generally, if there are $n$ flies on the table, how many can we guarantee to kill? Progress I haven't really made that much progress towards solving the stronger variant. The original problem can be proven in the following manner: Orient the flyswatter such that one of its ""edges"" (if the flyswatter is placed on the Cartesian coordinate plane with one black square being $0\leq x,y\leq 1$, the edges are the lines $x=n$ or $y=m$ for integer $m,n$) coincides with the line between flies $1$ and $2$. Now, ""slide"" it along this line so that fly $3$ is also on an edge. So, flies $1,2,$ and $3$ are now all killed. We need to kill two of the remaining $3$ flies. We now consider this orientation and placement with the flyswatter ""flipped"" so that black squares are now white and white are now black. Since each of the $3$ remaining flies is killed by one of these orientations, at least one of them must kill $2$ of the remaining flies, and $5$ total. This proof, when extended, shows that we can kill at least $$\left\lceil \frac{n+3}{2}\right\rceil$$ flies if we have $n$, but doesn't seem to be terribly extendable beyond there. I tried to prove that, for at least one of the $\binom{6}{2}\cdot 4$ choices of the original flyswatter configuration, all $3$ remaining flies are killed by the same orientation, but I was unsuccessful in relating any one configuration with another. The only idea I had was that it might be possible to prove that one can choose ""fly $3$"" in a smarter fashion to guarantee that all the remaining $3$ flies are killed by the same orientation, but I was unable to prove this and, even if proven, it is unlikely to generalize.

Since each of the $3$ remaining flies is killed by one of these orientations, at least one of them must kill $2$ of the remaining flies, and $5$ total. This proof, when extended, shows that we can kill at least $$\left\lceil \frac{n+3}{2}\right\rceil$$ flies if we have $n$, but doesn't seem to be terribly extendable beyond there. I tried to prove that, for at least one of the $\binom{6}{2}\cdot 4$ choices of the original flyswatter configuration, all $3$ remaining flies are killed by the same orientation, but I was unsuccessful in relating any one configuration with another. The only idea I had was that it might be possible to prove that one can choose ""fly $3$"" in a smarter fashion to guarantee that all the remaining $3$ flies are killed by the same orientation, but I was unable to prove this and, even if proven, it is unlikely to generalize. I was also unable to construct a counterexample (or even one that looks like a counterexample without a proof that it is one).",,"['combinatorics', 'contest-math', 'pigeonhole-principle']"

76,$N$ perfect logicians wearing hats,perfect logicians wearing hats,N,"I once came across the following riddle: (assume $N$ to be extremely large) There are $N$ perfect logicians arranged in a vertical row. They are   allowed to strategize before the game, during the game they are barred   from communicating. In the game, the lights are switched off, and a   single hat, either red or blue, is placed on the heads of each of the   logicians. The lights are turned on; each logician can see the hat   colours of all the people in front of him, he can't see the colour of   his own hat, or the people behind him. Start with the person at the   back, each logician has to call out a colour (heard by all). If his   own hat is of that colour, he is spared, otherwise, silently killed.   The same is done by the next person, and so on, right till the first   person. How many logicians can you guarantee to save, irrespective of   the initial colours or any probability? The answer was simple. The first logician would sacrifice his life. He would call out red if there are an even number of red hats in front of him, and black if there an odd number of red hats. After him, each logician can correctly tell the colour of his own hat. I decided to give the question a twist. Suppose there is a blind man among the logicians. His life is worth as much as anyone else, and he is placed randomly in the queue. How many logicians can you guarantee to save? The same approach wouldn't work because, if the blind man gave the wrong colour, not only him, but all the people in front of him will give the wrong colour as they depend on his information also. After a lot of thinking, I finally came up with this solution. Find the smallest $n$ such that $3(n+1)+2^n \geq N$. The first $3(n+1)$ people (from the back) will be the ones sacrificing their lives (Group A), and the rest ($2^n$) will try to figure out their own hat colours (Group B). Starting with the back of Group B, assign each logician an ($n+1$)-digit binary number, starting with a string of zeroes, and adding $1$ to get the next logician's ID. Note that the first digit will always be a $0$.The first Group is divided into $n+1$ subgroups of $3$ logicians each. Each subgroup is assigned a normal decimal number $1,2,3,\cdots$ and so on (again starting from the back). Let the subgroup number of a logician be $k$ When the game starts, each Group A logician will look at all the people in Group B, whose $k^{th}$ binary digit is $1$. Of these people, if there are an even number of red hats, he will say red, otherwise he will say blue. The other $2$ logicians in his subgroup will give exactly the same information as the first one. This is necessary to confirm that he is saying the truth, if there is a discrepancy among the $3$ answers, the information given by $2$ is correct, and the third one is the blind one. The same is done by everyone in Group A. The people of Group B only try to figure out their own hat colours. Each logician has $n+1$ ways of figuring out his own hat colour. If all of the given data doesn't lead to the same answer, he knows that the blind man is behind him and has already called out a lie. He can then use the first logician's info (first in Group A and the queue itself) to figure out his own colour, since the blind man has for sure been counted by that person. Is my approach correct and is there a faster one? I hope my question is clear enough.

I'm trying to prove that the matrix $$M=\begin{cases} m_{i,j}=f_{i,j}(\mathbf{x})\quad &\text{ if } j\neq i,\\ m_{i,j}=0&\text{ if } j=i\end{cases}$$ has full-rank, i.e. $\det(M)\neq 0$ (for $\mathbf{x}$ in $(0,1)^n$).

But I'm lost trying to tackle the general case: any suggestions/hints (i.e., they need to be full answers) are very welcome.

Perhaps, it would be easier to prove the result for this more general $f_{i,j}$.","For $\mathbf x\in\mathbb (0,1)^n$ with $n>2$ and a positive integer $1\le k<n$, define the mapping $f_{i,j}\colon (0,1)^n\rightarrow (0,1)$ by, $$f_{i,j}(\mathbf x)= \sum\limits_{\substack{\mathcal A \subset \{ 1,\ldots,n\}\backslash \{i,j\}\\   |\mathcal A|=k-1}}\quad\left( \prod\limits_{l\not\in \mathcal A\cup \{i,j\} }x_l\,\,\cdot\!\!\!\! \prod\limits_{ l\in \mathcal A}(1-x_l)\right).$$ Convention: if the set of indexes is empty, the product is one. I'm trying to prove that the matrix $$M=\begin{cases} m_{i,j}=f_{i,j}(\mathbf{x})\quad &\text{ if } j\neq i,\\ m_{i,j}=0&\text{ if } j=i\end{cases}$$ has full-rank, i.e. $\det(M)\neq 0$ (for $\mathbf{x}$ in $(0,1)^n$). I proved this for two particular cases: $k=1$, $f_{i,j}(\mathbf x)= \prod\limits_{ k\neq i,j} x_k$ and so that case is quite easy. Also if $k=n-1$, $f_{i,j}(\mathbf x)= \prod\limits_{ k\neq i,j} (1-x_k)$, which is also an easy case. However, for $1<k<n-1$, I can only solve by using brute force. For example, for $k=2$ and $n=4$, the matrix is: $$\left(\begin{array}{cccc}0 & x_3(1-x_4)+x_4(1-x_3) & x_2(1-x_4)+x_4(1-x_2) & x_2(1-x_3)+x_3(1-x_2) \\ x_3(1-x_4)+x_4(1-x_3) & 0 & x_1(1-x_4)+x_4(1-x_1) & x_1(1-x_3)+x_3(1-x_1) \\ x_2(1-x_4)+x_4(1-x_2) & x_1(1-x_4)+x_4(1-x_1) & 0 & x_1(1-x_2)+x_2(1-x_1) \\x_2(1-x_3)+x_3(1-x_2)  & x_1(1-x_3)+x_3(1-x_1) & x_1(1-x_2)+x_2(1-x_1) & 0\end{array}\right),$$ and using Mathematica, it can be shown that the determinant of $M$ is not zero for $\mathbf x \in (0,1)^4$. But I'm lost trying to tackle the general case: any suggestions/hints (i.e., they need to be full answers) are very welcome.

97,Expected number of cards you should turn before finding an ace,Expected number of cards you should turn before finding an ace,,"NOTE: I want to check my solution only Same question here The question is this: Shuffle an ordinary deck of 52 playing cards containing four aces. Then turn up the cards from the top until the first ace appears. On the average how many cards are required to be turned before producing the first ace ? I want to check my solution.It definitely matches with the answers in that other question but I don't understand their solutions(haven't done much study on probability yet). I want to check mine: We consider all the cards except the aces indistinguishable,and we will consider the aces to be indistinguishable.Now a deck is just a binary string with $48$ $C$ and $4$ $A$ ( $A$ stands for aces and $C$ stands for the other cards.Obviously,the number of such strings is $\dbinom{52}{4}$ . Now we divide into cases: 1)Number of strings with the first A in the $1$ st position: $\dbinom{51}{3}$ 2)Number of strings with  the first A in the $2$ nd position: $\dbinom{50}{3}$ .    .    . Number of strings with the first A in the $49$ th position: $\dbinom{3}{3}$ Since there are $4$ A's,the first $A$ cannot be in the $50$ th position.
