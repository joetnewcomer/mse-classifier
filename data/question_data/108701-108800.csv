0,Extending homomorphism on subgroup to the whole group,Extending homomorphism on subgroup to the whole group,,"I was working on homomorphisms and related concepts and I was wondering whether there exist some good criteria involving $H$ and $G_{1}$ which guarantees that all homomorphism $\phi$ on the subgroup $H$ of $G_{1}$ into an arbitrary group $G_{2}$ can be extended to a homomorphism $\bar{\phi}$ from all of $G_{1}$ to $G_{2}$ . And just to be clear: When I speak of an extension, I mean that I require that $\bar{\phi}$ restricted to H reduces to $\phi$ . ​ My current conjecture is that this is possible for all homomorphism on $H$ if and only if there exists a normal subgroup $N$ of $G_{1}$ such that $H$ is isomorphic to $G_{1}/N$ The criteria is certainly sufficient since then $G_{1}$ is the semidirect product of H and N and by mapping all elements in N to the identity in $G_{2}$ a homomorphism is constructed.

2,"Can a group have a subset that is stable under all automorphisms, but not under inverse?","Can a group have a subset that is stable under all automorphisms, but not under inverse?",,"The title really says it all. For any group $G$ the map $g\mapsto g^{-1}$ gives a (canonical) isomorphism from $G$ to the opposite group $G^\mathrm{op}$; this marks a difference with for instance non-commutative rings where the two might not be isomorphic. As a consequence there is for instance no fundamental difference between studying left and right group actions, even for a fixed group$~G$. So while groups cannot be in any manner ""naturally left-handed"", whatever that might be construed to mean, there is still the potential possibility of being able to point to some ""chiral"" subset of the group, a subset that might have some relation to the group without being in the same relation to the opposite group. It is quite evident that notions such as normaliser or centraliser applied to some (set of) elements will never yield such subset; indeed anything that is a subgroup will not do because it is closed under inverse. Which brought me to my question: Can a group $G$ have a subset closed under the action of $\operatorname{Aut}(G)$, but not under the map $g\mapsto g^{-1}$? Since one has in particular the inner automorphisms, one need only consider unions of conjugacy classes. I can see no reason why this should be impossible, but it is also hard to construct an example. For Abelian groups $g\mapsto g^{-1}$ is an automorphism, so no luck here On the other hand most symmetric groups have trivial outer automorphism groups; however here every $g$ is conjugate to $g^{-1}$, no luck either In alternating groups a conjugacy class of $S_n$ might fall apart, an an element might not be conjugate to its inverse; the two conjugacy classes would still however be related by an outer automorphism (coming from $S_n$) In $GL(n,K)$ most elements are not conjugate to their inverse; however there is an obvious out automorphism of transpose-inverse, and every invertible matrix is similar to its transpose (due to the theory of f.g. modules over a PID, leading to classification of similarity by invariant factors). Most ""natural"" subgroups of $GL(n,K)$ would suffer from the same ""outer automorphism"" phenomenon as alternating groups do, so they do not look promising. That's where I am now; I unfortunately do not know a lot of examples where I know enough to easily see whether I can find such subsets. Maybe a good candidate is the general linear group over a skew field (division ring), since the result of similarity to one's transpose does not hold there, as far as I know.

6,Maximal subgroups that force solvability.,Maximal subgroups that force solvability.,,"For which finite groups $M$ is it the case that every finite group $G$ with $M$ as a maximal subgroup solvable? If $M$ satisfies this condition then $M$ is solvable. Also, if $M$ is abelian then $M$ satisfies this condition . Futhermore, I believe that if $M$ is nilpotent and if all 2-subgroups of $M$ are normal subgroups of $M$ (if Sylow 2-subgroups of $M$ are abelian or quaternion, for example) then $M$ satisfies this condition (proof below). More specific questions: 1) Is there a non-nilpotent group that satisfies this condition? 2) Which 2-groups satisfy this condition? Apparently, the dihedral group of order 8 satisfies this condition (see Mikko Korhonen's comment on this post). Also, if $M\times N$ satisfies this condition then $M$ and $N$ both satisfy this condition. (This proof is adapted from j.p.'s answer to the linked question). Let $G$ be minimal such that $G$ is not solvable and such that $G$ contains a maximal subgroup $M$ that is nilpotent and whose 2-subgroups are normal. If $M$ contains a nontrivial normal subgroup $N$ of $G$ then $G/N$ contradicts the minimality of $G$ . Thus, $M$ does not contain nontrivial normal subgroups of $G$ . In particular, $N_G(P)=M$ for all Sylow $p$ -subgroups $P$ of $M$ . Then $P$ is a Sylow $p$ -subgroup of $N_G(P)$ so $P$ is a Sylow $p$ -subgroup of $G$ . This shows that $M$ is a Hall subgroup of $G$ . If $P$ is a Sylow $p$ -subgroup of $M$ and if $Q$ is a nontrivial normal subgroup of $P$ then $N_G(Q)=M$ which has a normal $p$ -complement. For $p=2$ , Frobenius' normal $p$ -complement theorem gives that $G$ has a normal $p$ -complement. For $p\geq3$ , Thompson's normal $p$ -complement theorem or Glauberman's normal $p$ -complement theorem gives that $G$ has a normal $p$ -complement (since you only have to consider characteristic $p$ -subgroups). Thus, for each prime $p$ dividing the order of $M$ , $G$ has a normal $p$ -complement. Then $M$ has a normal complement $N$ in $G$ . Since $M$ is solvable but $G$ is not solvable, $N$ is not solvable. In particular, $N$ does not admit a fixed-point-free automorphism of prime order. If $m\in Z(M)$ has prime order then $C_N(m)$ is nontrivial. Then $C_N(m)M$ is a subgroup of $G$ that properly contains $M$ so $C_N(m)M=G$ by the maximality of $M$ . Comparing cardinalities shows that $C_N(m)=N$ so $m\in Z(G)$ . Then $\langle m\rangle$ is a nontrivial normal subgroup of $G$ contained in $M$ which is a contradiction.","For which finite groups is it the case that every finite group with as a maximal subgroup solvable?

I write down the extended Dynkin diagram $\widetilde B_3$ corresponding to the Lie algebra of $\text{Spin}(7)$ with appended long root $\alpha_0$ , and short root $\alpha_3$ . Removing the short node $\alpha_3$ I get $A_3$ coresponding to the $SU(4)\cong \text{Spin}(6)$ subgroup. Cutting out $\alpha_1$ leaves something with a fold symmetry that gives the $G_2\leq \text{Spin}(7)$ subgroup inclusion. On the other hand, if we take out $\alpha_2$ then we are left with three $A_1$ 's. It's pretty clear that the pair given by $\alpha_0$ , $\alpha_1$ are the two commuting $\text{Spin}(3)$ -subgroups that together constitute the canonical $\text{Spin}(4)\leq \text{Spin}(7)$ . The final $A_1$ corresponds to the short root $\alpha_3$ , and is what is confusing me.

As such this third $A_1$ should be another $\text{Spin}(3)$ which commutes with the $\text{Spin}(4)$ identified previously.

72,Can free groups on different cardinals be isomorphic in ZF?,Can free groups on different cardinals be isomorphic in ZF?,,"For the free group on a finite number of generators, $F_n$ , this is simple. It is enough to find a group that can be a quotient of one and not the other, so it is sufficient to find a group that can be generated by $n$ generators and no less. The group $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$ works. Similarly, $\mathbb{Z}_2^{(\aleph_0)}$ cannot be finitely generated, showing the countably generated free group is not isomorphic to a finitely generated free group. With the axiom of choice, for any infinite cardinal $\kappa$ , $|F_{\kappa}|=\kappa$ , so cardinality sorts out all the other infinite free groups, showing $F_{\kappa}=F_{\lambda} \iff \kappa = \lambda$ . However, this is clearly requires the axiom of choice. In ZF, this proves free groups on different well-orderable cardinals are diferent, but not all cardinals. So I would like to know: is it consistent with ZF that free groups on two different cardinals can be isomorphic? And if so, which cardinals work, and what is the proof? My thinking: The proof in ZFC doesn'tn work here, as it is possible for $\mathbb{Z}_2^{(\kappa)} \cong \mathbb{Z}_2^{(\lambda)}$ for $\kappa \ne \lambda$ . Free groups are much like direct sum vector spaces in that they don't need any choice to define them and get a generating set, so there's no obvious reason choice would be necessary for this. It doesn't seem like being given an isomorphism between free groups on different cardinals would allow you to prove anything choicy about those cardinals. But there also isn't any obvious approch to proving they're not isomorphic, and when there's no obvious proof for something simple, it seems to usually be independent. I first thought that the universal property might be enough to distinguish them, but there are other algebraic categories where free objects on different cardinals are isomophic, even for finite cardinals ( Quick proof that free objects on sets of different cardinality are not isomorphic? ). As such, this seems a no-go. It also makes it look very likely that different cardinals can give isomorphic free groups. I then thought that I could leverage the fact that the same vector space can have different sized bases: if I quoutient out the necessary relations to make it commutative and self inverse, $F_\kappa \to \mathbb{Z}_2^{(\kappa)}$ . So this natural quotient can make free groups on different cardinals turn into isomorphic groups. It would be sufficient to prove that this quotient can't make non-isomorphic free groups become isomorphic. But this quotient can clearly make non-isomorphic groups isomorphic in general, and it may well be able to do so with free groups. And I don't know how to prove ths either way.

It has translational symmetry in two directions: a vertical shift by four lines and a horizontal shift by six lines.  One generating patch is shown with a solid line. However if you change just three colours of the 24 in the generating patch, many more symmetries appear.  This picture shows the same pattern, except that the colours within the dotted line have been changed.  The new symmetries are: 180 degree rotational symmetry about any of the marked points and also a horizontal translation by three composed with the operation which switches dark blue for light blue and dark pink for light pink.  The latter symmetry can be applied twice to get the horizontal translation by six symmetry from before. If the person who designed this pattern didn't know about the extra symmetries, they might have just filled in the 24 colours in the generating patch at random and then translated it to produce the whole curtain.  The number of ways of doing this is $4^{24}$. However, they might have started by generating the full pattern.  If they had done that, I think they would have only had 6 choices (both the rotation and the translation by 3 should cut the number of choices in half).  If instead they had decided to start with the full pattern and then make up to three changes to it, they would have needed to make the 6 original choices, then choose three of 24 colours to change and the colours to change them to.  The number of ways of doing this is $4^6 \times \binom{24}{3} \times 4^3$. Thus, the probability that the first scenario (choosing 24 colours at random) would produce a pattern so close to the modified one is $\frac{4^6 \times \binom{24}{3} \times 4^3}{4^{24}} \approx 1.885 \times 10^{-6}$.  This might suggest that they broke the full symmetry group intentionally to upset people like me.  However, I do not know how to calculate the chance that a randomly chosen generating 6 by 4 patch would be close to a pattern with some extra symmetries. My questions Suppose I generate a curtain pattern by choosing an $n$ by $m$ generating patch from $c$ possible colours.  This pattern automatically has symmetry group $\mathbb{Z}^2$.  What is the average number of colours I will have to change to get a larger group? (Or more precisely, if I want the group to be, say, twice as big, how many changes will I have to make on average?)  It's likely this depends on the underlying lattice (here, it's hexagonal) but I'm looking for techniques to answer this kind of question rather than numerical answers. The modified pattern has symmetry group generated by: $a$, the vertical translation by 4 $b$, the horizontal translation by 3 combined with the colour switching $c$, the rotation by 180 degrees about one of the marked points.

95,The smallest symmetric group $S_m$ into which a given dihedral group $D_{2n}$ embeds,The smallest symmetric group  into which a given dihedral group  embeds,S_m D_{2n},"Several questions, both here and on MathOverflow , address the issue of determining for a given group $G$ the smallest integer $\mu(G)$ for which there is an embedding (injective homomorphism) $G \hookrightarrow S_{\mu(G)}$. In general this is a difficult problem, but it's not hard to resolve the question for $G$ of small order , and $\mu(G)$ has been determined for some important classes of groups $G$. For example, for $G$ abelian, so that we can write $G$ uniquely (up to reordering) as $\Bbb Z_{a_1} \times \cdots \times \Bbb Z_{a_r}$ for (nontrivial) prime powers $a_1, \ldots, a_r$, $$\mu(G) = a_1 + \cdots + a_r .$$ And of course, $\mu(S_m) = m$. I have not been able to find, however, where this has been resolved for the dihedral groups; my question is: For each dihedral group $D_{2n}$ (of order $2 n$), what is the smallest symmetric group into which $D_{2n}$ embeds, that is, what is $\mu_n := \mu(D_{2n})$? Of course, $D_2 \cong S_2$ and $D_6 \cong S_3$, and so $\mu_1 = 2$ and $\mu_3 = 3$; also, $D_4 \cong \Bbb Z_2 \times \Bbb Z_2$, so by the above result $\mu_2 = \mu(D_4) = 4$. For any group $G$ and subgroup $H \leq G$, an embedding $G \hookrightarrow S_m$ determines an embedding $H \hookrightarrow S_m$, and so $\mu(H) \leq \mu(G)$. Thus, since $D_{2n} \cong \Bbb Z_n \rtimes \Bbb Z_2$, we have $\mu_n = \mu(D_{2n}) \geq \mu(\Bbb Z_n)$, which by the above is the sum $\Sigma_n$ of the prime powers in the prime factorization of $n$. On the other hand, for $n > 2$, the usual action by rotations and reflections of $D_{2n}$ on an $n$-gon is faithful and so determines an embedding $D_{2n} \hookrightarrow S_n$; in particular, this gives the upper bound $\mu_n \leq n$. Already, these bounds together give $\mu_4 = 4$ (realized by the embedding of the symmetry group of the square into the symmetric group on its vertices) and more generally that $\mu_a = a$ for prime powers $a > 2$. This is not sufficient, however, to determine $\mu_n$ for other integers $> 5$; for example, $\mu(\Bbb Z_6) = 5$, so these bounds only give $5 \leq \mu_6 \leq 6$. It turns out that $D_{12}$ can be embedded in $S_5$ (as David points out in a comment under his question, this embedding can be realized explicitly as $\langle(12)(345), (12)(34)\rangle$), and this settles $\mu_6 = 5$. The above results together determine the subsequence $$(\mu_1, \ldots, \mu_9) = (2, 4, 3, 4, 5, 5, 7, 8, 9) ,$$ which in particular does not appear in the OEIS . Edit Per David's answer, the sequence $(\mu_n)$ appears to be given by $$ \mu_n := \left\{\begin{array}{cl}2, & n = 1\\ 4, & n = 2\\ \Sigma_n, & n > 2 \end{array}\right. , $$ and $(\Sigma_n)$ itself appears in the OEIS as sequence A008475 .","Several questions, both here and on MathOverflow , address the issue of determining for a given group $G$ the smallest integer $\mu(G)$ for which there is an embedding (injective homomorphism) $G \hookrightarrow S_{\mu(G)}$.
