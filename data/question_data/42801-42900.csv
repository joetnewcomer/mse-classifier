I think I found that it is irreducible but my solution is really complicated, quite long and I am not sure whether this is correct. I would really appreciate it if someone could point out any mistakes or tell me whether my reasoning is correct. Sadly, I cannot use the classical theorems like Eisenstein (there is no common divisor of the coefficients $-3,2$ and $1$ and neither I have found a good reduction modulo some prime $p$ . I have tried $p=2$ , which gave me $X^4+X^2+1$ which is reducible and $p=3$ which gave me $X^4+2X+1$ for which $-1$ is a root thus also reducible. Out of options, I resorted to doing it by hand. Since $f$ is normed it is primitive. Thus, $f$ irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}[X]$ if and only if it is irreducible over $\mathbb{Z}[X]$ which follows by Gauss. Then, I checked whether the polynomial had any roots in $\mathbb Z$ . It does not because since every root  of a polynomial must a divisor of the constant term, here $1$ only $\pm 1$ are possible options for roots. Since $f(\pm 1)\neq 0$ I deduced that f does not have rational roots. Thus, if $f=gh$ for some polynomials $g,h\in \mathbb{Z}[X]$ , then both $g$ and $h$ need to be quadratic. So I made the following ansatz \begin{align} f&=gh=(\alpha_1X^2+\beta_1X+\gamma_1)(\alpha_2X^2+\beta_2X+\gamma_2)\\ &=\alpha_1\alpha_2X^4+(\alpha_1\beta_2+\alpha_2\beta_1)X^3+(\beta_1\beta_2+\gamma_1\alpha_2+\gamma_2\alpha_1)X^2+(\beta_1\gamma_2+\beta_2\gamma_1)X+\gamma_2\gamma_1 \end{align} with $\alpha_i,\beta_i,\gamma_i\in\mathbb{Z}$ for $i=1,2$ . Then, I can start doing some simplification by comparing this to the original f. Obviously, $\alpha_1=\alpha_2=\pm1$ , from which we can deduce by looking at the term proportional to $X^3$ that $\alpha_1\beta_2+\beta_1\alpha_2=\pm(\beta_1+\beta_2)=0$ , it follows $\beta=\beta_1=-\beta_2)$ . However, at the same time $\gamma_1=\gamma_2=\pm 1$ . Then, by looking at the term proportional to $X$ , we see that $\beta_2\gamma_1+\beta_1\gamma_2=\pm(\beta_1+\beta_2)=2$ which is a contradiction.

54,Showing $f(t) = t^4 + 2t^2 + 9$ is reducible over $\Bbb Q$,Showing  is reducible over,f(t) = t^4 + 2t^2 + 9 \Bbb Q,"So, as a part of a homework problem, I'm tasked with showing that $f(t) = t^4 + 2t^2 + 9$ , despite having no roots in the rationals, is reducible over them. The former task - showing a lack of rational roots - is pretty easy, but the latter is proving an absolute pain. And I suspect it's actually not reducible. It is obvious that since $f$ has no rational roots, we know that, if $f$ is reducible, it must have a factorization $f = gh$ where $g,h$ are quadratics. If we made the substitution $u = t^2$ then $f(u) = u^2 + 2u + 9$ . This doesn't seem immediately factorizable by elementary methods (i.e. the whole ""sum of factors of constant term sum to the linear coefficient"" thing we learn in middle school). Okay so what now? My immediate thought was to play around with the fundamental theorem of algebra just to simplify matters. So we find roots for $f$ in terms of $u$ , which are $u = -1 + 4i \sqrt 2, \overline u = -1 - 4i \sqrt 2$ . Edit: As noted in one of the answers, by egreg, I actually did not find the correct roots in terms of $u$ : I forgot to divide the coefficient of the root by two. And, of course, other answers have also noted I overlooked some factoring techniques. Oh well, such is life. In any event, note that this error rippled forward from here in my work and made everything more problematic. Then by our substitution, the roots to $f$ in terms of $t$ are $\sqrt u, -\sqrt u, \sqrt {\overline{u}}, - \sqrt{\overline{u}}$ . Thus by the fundamental theorem of algebra, $$f(t) = (t-\sqrt u)(t-\sqrt {\overline{u}})(t+\sqrt u)(t+\sqrt {\overline{u}})$$ Surely, some pairing of these four factors in two groups of two will multiply together to give a quadratic in rational coefficients, yielding that $f$ is reducible. However, no matter how I pair them, I can't seem to make this work. Consider our first factor. If you multiply it by the second, the linear coefficient is $-(\sqrt u + \sqrt{ \overline {u}})$ . Wolfram gives this as $\sqrt{2\sqrt{33} - 2}$ . Obviously not rational. If you choose the third, then you get a square root of a nonreal complex number as the constant term. Thus, it is not rational. If we choose the fourth, then we get the linear coefficient to be $\sqrt{ \overline {u}} - \sqrt u$ . Wolfram gives this to be a purely imaginary number, same coefficient as before otherwise. So no matter which way we pair the first factor it seems we cannot generate a quadratic with rational coefficients. Does this mean there's some sort of mistake on the assignment, that this polynomial is irreducible? Am I overlooking something, making an error somewhere? (I've been dealing with this for a few hours now and it's not unrealistic, given how late the hour is, that I might have overlooked a flaw somewhere.)","So, as a part of a homework problem, I'm tasked with showing that , despite having no roots in the rationals, is reducible over them.

Why can't we just show that since $X^4-16X^2+4$ has no rational roots hence irreducible? 2. Why do we have to factorise into a product of two monic quadratic polynomials with integer coefficients? Why monic? And why can't we factorise into polynomial with degree 1 and 3? Also, lastly why the coefficients have to be integers? Thank you for any explanations! Edit: Thanks for all the answers. I saw that Second Gauss Lemma is used. But I only learned the first one in class. Which is: Let $R$ be a Unique Facorisation Domain. If $f,g\in\mathbb{R}[X]$ are primitive, then so too is their product $fg$. Is it inevitable to use Second Gauss Lemma?

96,Is $G/pG$ is a $p$-group?,Is  is a -group?,G/pG p,"Jack is trying to prove: Let $G$ be an abelian group, and $n\in\Bbb Z$. Denote $nG = \{ng \mid g\in G\}$. (1) Show that $nG$ is a subgroup in $G$. (2) Show that if $G$ is a finitely generated abelian group, and $p$ is prime,    then $G/pG$ is a $p$-group (a group whose order is a power of $p$). I think $G/pG$ is a $p$-group because it is a direct sum of cyclic groups of order $p$. But I cannot give a detailed proof.","Jack is trying to prove: Let $G$ be an abelian group, and $n\in\Bbb Z$.

97,The intersection of distinct maximal ideals is not prime.,The intersection of distinct maximal ideals is not prime.,,"Let $P,Q$ be distinct maximal ideals of a ring $R$. Prove that $P\cap Q$ is not prime. I am not sure how to prove this.

98,Module generated by set $S$,Module generated by set,S,"Let's denote the free $R$-module generated by a set $S \subset M$ where $M$ is a module by $\langle S \rangle$. Then this is by definition the intersection of all modules $N \subset M$ containing $S$. I'd like to show that $$\langle S \rangle = \{ \sum_{k = 1}^n r_k s_k : r_k \in R, s_k \in S \}$$ The inclusion $\supset$ is obvious: if $x = \sum_{k = 1}^n r_k s_k $ then clearly $x$ is in every module $M$ with $S \subset M$. Hence $x \in \langle S \rangle$. Now for some reason the other inclusion is not obvious to me. Let $x \in \langle S \rangle$. Then $x$ is in every module $N \subset M$ with $S \subset N$. How do I proceed from here? Edit I made a mistake when I wrote this question. The module generated by $S$ is only free if $S$ is finite.

99,Invertible and primitive polynomials,Invertible and primitive polynomials,,"I shall prove some properties on a polynomial ring $R[x]$ over a commutative ring $R$, and there are two with which I struggle: For some $f=a_0+a_1x+\cdots+a_nx^n\in R[x]$, $f$ is invertible in $R[x] \Leftrightarrow a_0$ is invertible, and $a_1,...,a_n$ are nilpotent. $fg$ is primitive $\Leftrightarrow	f$ and $g$ are primitive, where primitive means: $(a_0,...,a_n)=(1)$. The first one is quite intuitive and $a_0$ must be invertible since the first coefficient of the unit-polynomial shall be $1$, but I do not follow the nilpotency of the other coefficients.
