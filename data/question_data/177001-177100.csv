Choose a such that , and take a partition of with width lesser than . Denote by the rectangles of that lie in some of , and by the remaining rectangles of . From here, if we could conclude that there are at most of the rectangles because each one of these should have, in their interior, a point of the partition of the closed interval (and their interiors are disjoint).

26,The solution of the Euler-Bernoulli equation via separation of variables,The solution of the Euler-Bernoulli equation via separation of variables,,"I'm trying to solve the Euler-Bernoulli equation for a beam for a construction with a solution in the form of $w(\zeta,t) = f(\zeta)g(t)$ (separation of variables). However, it is mentioned that this can still be tricky, but since the beam is undamped, we can assume $ g(t) = e^{i \lambda t}$ with $\lambda$ real. My first question is; why is the above choice logical to assume? (does this have anything to do with $e^{i \lambda t} = cos(\lambda t) + i sin(\lambda t)$ for $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ ) I made a beginning with the separation of variable technique: The Euler-Bernoulli equation: $\rho\frac{\partial^{2}w}{\partial t^{2}}(\zeta,t) = -EI\frac{\partial^{4}w}{\partial \zeta^{4}}(\zeta,t),\text{ }\text{ }\text{ }\zeta \in [0,1], t \geq 0$ With boundary conditions: $w(0,t) = w(1,t), \frac{\partial w}{\partial \zeta}(0,t) = \frac{\partial w}{\partial \zeta}(1,t)$ Substituting $w(\zeta,t) = f(\zeta)g(t)$ in the Euler-Bernoulli equation gives: $\rho\frac{\partial^{2}f(\zeta)g(t)}{\partial t^{2}}(\zeta,t) = -EI\frac{\partial^{4}f(\zeta)g(t)}{\partial \zeta^{4}}(\zeta,t)$ $f(\zeta)\rho\frac{\partial^{2}g(t)}{\partial t^{2}}(\zeta,t) = -EIg(t)\frac{\partial^{4}f(\zeta)}{\partial \zeta^{4}}(\zeta,t)$ Since space and time are in this case independent of each other, both sides have to be equal to the same constant - $\lambda$ . This gives us a set of three qualities: $ 1. \frac{d^2g(t)}{dt^2} = -g(t)\lambda \\ 2. \frac{d^4f(\zeta)}{d\zeta^4} = \rho f(t)\frac{\lambda}{EI} \\ 3. w(0,t) = w(1,t) \rightarrow f(0) = f(1) $ The general solution of g(t) (if positive) is: $ g(t) = C_{1} * e^{-i \sqrt{\lambda}t} + C_{2} * e^{i \sqrt{\lambda}t} $ Using Euler's formula, g(t) becomes: $ g(t) = C_1 cos(\sqrt{\lambda}t) + C_2 sin(\sqrt{\lambda}t) $ From here, I am pretty much stuck to find a proposed solution for $f(\zeta)$ and to determine the solution to this problem. The second question now is how to determine a proposed solution for $f(\zeta)$ and how to determine the 3 lowest (strictly positive) $\lambda$ 's such that $w(\zeta,t) = f(\zeta)e^{i\lambda t}$ is a non-zero solution of the Euler-Bernoulli equation?

WLOG let $\phi(0,0) = 0$ . Let now $(U, id)$ be a local chart of $\mathbb{R}^2$ for its $C^{\infty}$ structure.

The function $g$ is specified explicitly and in the simplest case it could be $g(t) = tx$. Then the chain rule is always given as $$ \begin{align} \frac{d f}{dt}(tx) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(tx) \frac{d (tx)}{dt}. \end{align} $$ Replacing $tx$ by $g(t)$ (so we can compare it with the usual chain rule above) we have $$ \begin{align} \frac{d}{dt}f(g(t)) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial \color{red}{ \textbf{x}}}(g(t)) \cdot \frac{dg}{dt}(t), \quad \quad (2) \end{align} $$ where I have highlighted the problematic issue.

What I did: I must show that if $f\in C^1(E,F)$ and $f(tx)=tf(x)$ for all $t>0$ for all $x\in E\setminus\{0\}$ then $f\in\mathcal L(E,F)$. Using the chain rule I know that $$\partial[f(tx)]=t\partial f(tx)=t\partial f(x)=\partial[t f(x)]\implies \partial f(tx)=\partial f(x),\quad \forall t>0$$ Thus, by the continuity of $\partial f$, $\partial f(x)$ is a constant function for each $x\in E$, and by differentiation it can be seen that $$f(x)=\partial f(x)x+v\quad\text{and}\quad f(tx)=tf(x)\implies v=0$$ Thus $f$ is linear, as required. UPDATE: I now think that the above is not totally correct. I solved the exercise in a different way (with a more explicit result) using the fact that $f$ is differentiable at zero. From the first attempt above we knows that $\partial f$ is a constant function in the sets $\{tx:t>0\text{ and } x\in E\setminus\{0\}\}$. And because $f$ is differentiable at zero by assumption then using the directional derivatives of $f$ at zero we can see that $$D_vf(0):=\lim_{t\to 0}\frac{f(0+tv)-f(0)}t\in F\implies\matrix{f(0)=0\;\text{ and }\\D_vf(0)=f(v)=-f(v),\forall v\in E\setminus\{0\}}$$ Thus $f$ is a constant function and because $f(0)=0$ then $f=0$.",,"['multivariable-calculus', 'proof-verification', 'frechet-derivative']"
