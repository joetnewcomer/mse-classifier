Boundedness, closedness, compactness and completeness.",,"Let $X$ be the space of all real sequences with finitely many nonzero elements, equipped with the supremum norm. That is, for each $x= (x_k)_{k \in \mathbb N}$ we have: $$ \|x \| = \sup \{ |x_k| k\in \mathbb N \}.$$ Consider the subset $V$ of $X$ defined by: $$ V:= \{ x= (x_k)_{k \in \mathbb N} \in X | \sum_{k=1}^\infty |x_k| \leq 1 \}.$$ I wish to answer the following practice exam questions: Is $V$ bounded in $X$ ? Is $V$ closed in $X$ ? Is $V$ compact in $X$ ? Is $V$ complete in $X$ ? Consider $x=(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb N}\in V$ , we then have that for each $n\in \mathbb N$ we may write: $$ |x_n| \leq \sum_{k=1}^\infty|x_k| \leq 1 $$ Each term is nonnegative and therefore the entire sum is certainly more than a single term. We thus find that $1$ is an upper bound for each element of the sequence hence certainly it is larger than or equal to the least upper bound: $$ \| x\| \leq 1.  $$ We conclude that $V$ is bounded. I think this is not true as there are sequences in $V$ that leave the space (and $X$ ). Consider $x^{(n)}$ given by: $$x^1= (\frac{1}{2}, 0, 0, \dots) $$ $$x^2=(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, 0, \dots) $$ $$x^3=(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8},0, \dots) $$ Which might be described as $(x^n_k)_{k \in \mathbb N}$ with $x^n_k=\frac{1}{2^{k}}$ for $k\leq n$ and $0$ otherwise ( $0 \not \in \mathbb N$ ). Each of the elements of this sequence lives in $X$ and since the geometric series converges to $1$ also in $V$ . So $$ \sum_{k=1}^\infty |x^k_n| \leq 1 .$$ However, we run into a problem since  its limit is $x=(x_k)_{k\in \mathbb N}$ with $x_n=\frac{1}{2^n}$ , which does not have finitely many nonzero elements hence it is not in $X$ and then certainly not in $V$ . Compact normed vector spaces are closed, since the space is not closed, it cannot be compact.

Just by using theory, it's an Hilbert Schmidt operator, so it's compact. Indeed, the kernel $k(x,y) = \sin(x^2+y^2) \in L^2([0,1] \times [0,1])$ . I want to use a more direct approach, by using Ascoli-Arzelà. First of all, I see that $|Tu(s)-Tu(t)|=| \int_0^1 [\sin(s^2+y^2)-\sin(t^2+y^2)]u(y)dy| < \varepsilon ||u||_{L^2}^2$ , since $s \mapsto \sin(s^2+y^2)$ is continuous on a compact set, then it's unformly continuous . Then $Tu(x)$ is continuous, and then $T: L^2([0,1]) \rightarrow C^{0}[0,1] \subset L^2([0,1])$ To prove compactness, I take $B \subset L^2(0,1)$ , with $||u|| \leq M_b$ , for $u \in B$ . I want to prove that $T(B)$ is relatively compact in $C^0([0,1])$ by using Ascoli-Arzelà. $T(B)$ is equibounded $|Tu(x)|=|\int_0^1 \sin(x^2+y^2) u(y) dy| \leq 1\cdot ||u||_{L^2}^2 \leq M_b$ Now I show equicontinuity Again, I compute $|Tu(s)-Tu(t)| = \int_0^1 [\sin(s^2+y^2)-\sin(t^2+y^2)]u(y)dy| \leq |s-t| ||u||_{L^2}^2$ by MVT applied to $s \mapsto \sin(s^2+y^2)$ for $s \in [0,1]$ . So $T(B)$ is equilipschitz, thus equicontinuos. Then, by Ascoli-Arzelà, $T(B)$ is relatively compact in $C^0([0,1])$ . Now, since the immersion $C^0 \hookrightarrow L^2[0,1]$ is continuos, then $T(B)$ is relatively compact in $L^2[0,1]$ . Is my second approach okay?

How can I find a Banach space $E$, for that, $H=B(E)$ where $B(E)$ is the set of bounded linear operator on $E$? (At least under some conditions on $H$) Also if the Hilbert space $H$ is Banach algebra, when we can find a Banach space $E$, such that $H$ is a Banach-algebra-isomorphism isometric with some Banach subalgebra of $B(E)$?","Consider $H$ as a Hilbert space.

My attempt: This question comes down to showing that $d$ is a metric, which means that: $d(f,g)\geq 0$ $d(f,g)=0\iff f=g$ $d(f,g)=d(g,f)$ Triangular sadness. 1) Nonnegativity is guaranteed by taking the supremum of the absolute value of a sum, since the absolute value of a sum is non-negative, the supremum of non-negative numbers is non-negative.  $\square$ 2) For the supremum of $|f(x)-g(x)|$ to be equal to $0$, the greatest number for $|f(x)-g(x)|$ from $0\leq x\leq 1$ must be $0$, hence $|f(x)-g(x)|=0$ for all values on this range, and thus $f(x)=g(x)$ is the constant zero map.  $\square$ 3) $|f(x)-g(x)|=|g(x)-f(x)|$ implies that $\sup \limits_{0\leq x \leq 1} |f(x)-g(x)|=\sup \limits_{0\leq x \leq 1} |g(x)-f(x)|$ $\square$ 4) Triangular sadness: We need to prove that $d(f,g)\leq d(f,h) + d(g,h)$ I.e.  $\sup \limits_{0\leq x \leq 1} |f(x)-g(x)|\leq \sup \limits_{0\leq x \leq 1} |f(x)-h(x)|+\sup \limits_{0\leq x \leq 1} |g(x)-h(x)|$ Now I am not sure how I can 'behave' with the sup 'function'. Can I do the following? $$\sup|f(x)-g(x)| = \sup|f(x)-g(x)+h(x)-h(x)|=\sup|f(x)-h(x)+(h(x)-g(x))|$$ Then use normal triangular inequality: $$\sup|f(x)-h(x)+(h(x)-g(x))|\leq \sup(|f(x)-h(x)|+|h(x)-g(x)|)=\sup(|f(x)-h(x)|+|g(x)-h(x)|)$$ This is obviously less than $\sup \limits_{0\leq x \leq 1} |f(x)-h(x)|+\sup \limits_{0\leq x \leq 1} |g(x)-h(x)|$, but I don't know how to prove it.
