If $\mu$ is a set function mapping some collection $\mathscr B$ of subsets of $X$ to $[0, \infty]$ then $\mu$ is monotone if for $A, B \in \mathscr B $ and $A \subset B$ then $\mu(A) \le \mu(B)$ $\mu$ is sub-additve if for $A, B$ and $A \cup B \in \mathscr B $ then $\mu(A \cup B) \le \mu(A) + \mu(B)$ Proposition: monotonicity and sub-additive are independent.

I'd like to ask anyone here for some recommendations on infinite  graph  theory (pdfs, books, lecture notes etc.). Thanks in advance!

We already know that $ a)$ $\lambda(A) + \lambda(B) \le \lambda(A + B)$ with $A = [a_1, b_1), B = [a_2, b_2).$ I didn't solve this either, wrote it down here: Prove that $\lambda(A + B) \ge \lambda(A) + \lambda(B) $ for A and B being half-open intervals Now, for this sub-excercise, I started the following way: For $n = 2$ , we get that $n_1 = n_2 = 1$ , and thus, we get: $\lambda(\bigcup_{k=1}^{n_1} I_k) + \lambda(\bigcup_{k=1}^{n_2} J_k) = \lambda(A) + \lambda(B)$ , and thus, the inequality follows from $a)$ . For $n \rightarrow n+1$ : We can either work with $n_1 + 1$ or $n_2 + 1$ , so let's just define $(n+1) := (n_1 + 1) + n_2$ . As long as I understood it so far, we use the same union of $J_k$ for $B$ , but a different kind of union of $I_k$ for $A$ . Besides that, we are still talking about the same $A$ here. We have to show: $\lambda(\bigcup_{k=1}^{n_1+1} I_k) + \lambda(\bigcup_{k=1}^{n_2} J_k) \le \lambda(\bigcup_{k=1}^{n_1+1} I_k + \bigcup_{k=1}^{n_2} J_k)$ . Now, my intuitive approach would be to write $\bigcup_{k=1}^{n_1} I_k \cup I_{n+1}$ , and with the help of using the induction hypothesis, we would get that this is $\le \lambda(\bigcup_{k=1}^{n_1+1} I_k + \bigcup_{k=1}^{n_2} J_k) + \lambda(I_{n+1})$ . Unfortunately, this is nonsense because we cannot assume that $\lambda(I_{n+1}) = 0$ , and thus, we wouldn't get the desired expression. Looking further into it tells me why this is nonsense: In the induction hypothesis, we assumed that $A = (\bigcup_{k=1}^{n_1} I_k)$ . Now, of course we could also assume that $A = (\bigcup_{k=1}^{n_1+1} I_k)$ and say that this is just a different union of $A$ , but when we now take a look at $(\bigcup_{k=1}^{n_1} I_k \cup I_{n+1}))$ , then it seems like this left union cannot be the same union as the one we assumed to have in the induction hypothesis. This would only hold for $I_{n+1} = \{\emptyset\}$ , but I don't think that we are allowed to assume so. So I guess we have to work with these disjoint unions mentioned above, but I don't know how to do it. I mean, I found that I could construct these disjoint unions with the specific properties by dividing $A$ and $B$ by $2$ (at least I think I did), but I don't see how this helps me here.","Assume that , , are disjoint unions with .

63,Existence of minimal decomposition of bounded linear functional on $C_c(X)$,Existence of minimal decomposition of bounded linear functional on,C_c(X),"In this post of Prof Tao, it shows a lemma about the decomposition of bounded linear functional and a related exercise. The content is Lemma 9 (Jordan decomposition for functions) Let $I \in C_c(X \rightarrow \bf{R})^*$ be a (real) continuous linear functional. Then there exist positive linear functions $I^+, I^- \in C_c(X \rightarrow \bf{R})^*$ such that $I = I^+ - I^-$ . Exercise 15 Show that among all possible choices for the functionals $I^+, I^-$ appearing in the above lemma, there is a unique choice which is minimal in the sense that for any other functionals $\tilde I^+, \tilde I^-$ obeying the conclusions of the lemma, one has $\tilde I^+(f) \geq I^+(f)$ and $\tilde I^-(f) \geq I^-(f)$ for all $f \in C_c(X \rightarrow \bf{R})$ . I have a question about the existence of the so-called minimal decomposition , because roughly speaking I think THE sense of ordering  between two decompositions defined in the exercise is not necessarily applicable to any two decompositions. More precisely, given any two decompositions $I=I^+_1-I^-_1=I^+_2-I^-_2$ ， the only thing we can get is that the equality $I^+_1(f)-I^+_2(f)=I^-_1(f)-I^-_2(f)$ holds for any $f\in C_c(X)$ .

It is required only that $I^+_1-I^+_2$ and $I^-_1-I^-_2$ are the same general linear functional. Then we can't say which decomposition is greater or less than which, right ? In my opinion, this ordering is a partial order among all possible decompositions. Right ?

Problem: Let z be an integer and $f(t) = a_nt^n + ... + a_1t + a_0$ be a polynomial with integer coefficients. Then there is a unique way to write $f(t)$ in the form $b_n(t - z)^n + ... + b_1(t - z) + b_0$. For instance, if $z = 3$ and $f(t) = t^2 + 4t − 1$, then $f(t) = (t - 3)^2 + 10(t - 3) + 20$.

First we will show that $A_k$ satisfies the desired properties (i) If $m,n \in A_k$ then $ m+n \in A_k$:  Let $b_m$ be the leading coefficient of element m and $b_n$ be the leading coefficient of element n when written in the form given above.  Then in case 1: m is of higher degree than n.  Then the leading coefficient of m+n is $b_m$ which we know is $>$ 0 since $m \in A_k$.  In case 2: n is of higher degree than m.  Then the leading coefficient of m+n is $b_n$ which we know is $>$ 0 since $n \in A_k$.  And in case 3: n is of the same degree as m.  Then the leading coefficient of m+n is $b_n + b_m$ which we know is $>$ 0 since $n \in A_k$ and $m \in A_k$. (ii) If $m,n \in A_k$ then $mn \in A_k$:  Let $b_m$ be the leading coefficient of element m and $b_n$ be the leading coefficient of element n when written in the form given above.  Then the leading coefficient of m+n is $(b_m)(b_n)$ which we know is $>$ 0 since $m \in A_k$ and $n \in A_k$. (iii) $0 \notin A_k$:  The zero polynomial has a leading coefficient $b_n = 0 \ngtr 0$.  So $0 \notin A_k$. (iv) For every $m \in Z$, we have $m \in A_k$ or $m = 0$ or $−m \in A_k$:  Let $m \in Z$.  Suppose (iv) does not hold.  Since $m \notin A_k$, we know that $b_m \leq 0$.  So $b_m = 0$ or $b_m < 0$.  Since we assumed (iv) does not hold, we must have $b_m < 0$.  So $0 - b_m \in N$, which gives us $-b_m \in N$, so $-b_m > 0$.  Since the leading coefficient of $-m$ is $-b_m$, $-m \in A_k$.  This is a contradiction since we assumed (iv) does not hold.  So (iv) does hold for $A_k$. Now we will show that there are infinitely many subsets $A_k$.  Since k is any integer, we can get infinitely many $A_k$s by varying k since Z is an infinite set. All that remains is to show that each subset $A_k$ is different for different k.  This is where I'm stuck but I'm pretty sure that it's possible to show this.

First we will show that $A_k$ satisfies the desired properties (i) If $m,n \in A_k$ then $ m+n \in A_k$:  Let $b_m$ be the leading coefficient of element m and $b_n$ be the leading coefficient of element n when written in the form given above.  Then in case 1: m is of higher degree than n.  Then the leading coefficient of m+n is $b_m$ which we know is $>$ 0 since $m \in A_k$.  In case 2: n is of higher degree than m.  Then the leading coefficient of m+n is $b_n$ which we know is $>$ 0 since $n \in A_k$.  And in case 3: n is of the same degree as m.  Then the leading coefficient of m+n is $b_n + b_m$ which we know is $>$ 0 since $n \in A_k$ and $m \in A_k$. (ii) If $m,n \in A_k$ then $mn \in A_k$:  Let $b_m$ be the leading coefficient of element m and $b_n$ be the leading coefficient of element n when written in the form given above.  Then the leading coefficient of m+n is $(b_m)(b_n)$ which we know is $>$ 0 since $m \in A_k$ and $n \in A_k$. (iii) $0 \notin A_k$:  The zero polynomial has a leading coefficient $b_n = 0 \ngtr 0$.  So $0 \notin A_k$. (iv) For every $m \in Z$, we have $m \in A_k$ or $m = 0$ or $−m \in A_k$:  Let $m \in Z$.  Suppose (iv) does not hold.  Since $m \notin A_k$, we know that $b_m \leq 0$.  So $b_m = 0$ or $b_m < 0$.  Since we assumed (iv) does not hold, we must have $b_m < 0$.  So $0 - b_m \in N$, which gives us $-b_m \in N$, so $-b_m > 0$.  Since the leading coefficient of $-m$ is $-b_m$, $-m \in A_k$.  This is a contradiction since we assumed (iv) does not hold.  So (iv) does hold for $A_k$. Now we will show that there are infinitely many subsets $A_k$.  Since k is any integer, we can get infinitely many $A_k$s by varying k since Z is an infinite set. All that remains is to show that each subset $A_k$ is different for different k.  This is where I'm stuck but I'm pretty sure that it's possible to show this.  Would appreciate any help on this, thanks! Update: still stuck, but I think the approach is correct. any ideas?  Thanks!",,"['real-analysis', 'elementary-set-theory', 'polynomials']"

For $k = 3$ there are two solutions, $\{B, B, b\}$ and $\{B, b, b\}$. These two sets represent the minimum requirements to pass. Then for any $k$, I was thinking the number of multisets to be $$2 * (\frac{(4 + (k-3) - 1)!}{((k-3)!(n-1)!})$$ My reasoning was that the possible valid sets are $\{B, B, b, x_3, x_4, ... x_k\}$ and $\{B, b, b, x_3, x_4, ... x_k\}$,  where $\{x_3, x_4, ..., x_k\}$ is any multiset from {A, a, B, b} with cardinality $k - 3$.

For example, if k = 4, the valid sets are $\{B, B, b, x_3\}$ and $\{B, b, b, y_3\}$, where $x_3$ and $y_3$ are any item in $\{A, a, B, b\}$. For $x_3 = b$ and $y_3 = B$, I am counting the set $\{B, B, b, b\}$ twice. I tried predicting the number of duplicate counts and subtracting that, but could not find an answer.

Based off of these comments I came up with, $$ numValid(D, minB) = \sum_{nb = minB - 2}^{D-2} [(nb + 1) * (D - nb - 1)] $$ The first term inside the sum $(nb + 1)$ is the number of multisets of size $minB - 2$ chosen from $\{B, b\}$.

Alternately, a non-existence result that you can't maintain some of the important properties of $\mathbb{R}^n$ in a generalization like this would be interesting to me.","This is not a very well-defined question.

97,Standard notation for 'same' function with different ranges,Standard notation for 'same' function with different ranges,,"Does anyone know of a standard notation for the situation when we want to define the 'same' function but on a larger or smaller range. More precisely, if $$f:A \to B$$ is a function and $C$ contains $f(A)$, then we can define a function $$g:A \to C$$ in the obvious way (put $g(a)=f(a)$). These functions are different, but it's extremely cumbersome to have to write out this difference every time. (By the way, the context this has come up in has been in thinking about algebraic substructures. For example, if $G$ is a group then there is a binary operation $m$ on $G$ satisfying the usual properties. We'd like to define a subgroup by saying that it is a subset $H$ of $G$ which is a group under the restriction of $m$ to $H \times H$, but unfortunately this restriction is not a binary operation (because it's range is technically still $G$). So we're forced to make an annoying adjustment as described above...)","Does anyone know of a standard notation for the situation when we want to define the 'same' function but on a larger or smaller range.

99,the intersection of an empty family of sets; what's wrong with this proof?,the intersection of an empty family of sets; what's wrong with this proof?,,"I have an exercise which says Prove $\bigcap S$ exists for all $S\neq\emptyset$. Where is the   asssumption that $S\neq\emptyset$ used in the proof? The definition of intersection is $x\in\bigcap S\iff x\in A$ for every $A\in S$ I HAVE read some of the other discussions where it is explained that $\bigcap\emptyset$ is the set of all sets. What I want to ask about is why my ""proof"" fails, because it seems like I can say $\bigcap\emptyset$ exists, which shouldn't be the case. Something should be stopping me? Proof: My axiom schema of comprehension says that for any property $P(x)$ and for any set $A$, there exists a set $B$ such that $x\in B \iff [x\in A$ and $P(x)]$. Well given any set $S$, the union $U=\bigcup S$ exists (axiom of union). Let $P(x,S)$ be the property ""$x\in A$ for every $A\in S$"". Then there exists a set $I$ such that $x\in I\iff [x\in U\text{ and }P(x,S)]$. I've constructed a set $I$, now I just have to argue that it has the property of $\bigcap S$. If $x\in I$, then $P(x,S)$ holds, so $x\in A$ for every $A\in S$. If $x\in A$ for every $A\in S$, then $x\in A$ for some $A\in S$ (so $x\in U$). So $x\in U$ and $P(x,S) \Rightarrow$ $x\in I$. This proves $x\in I \iff x\in A$ for every $A\in S$. Therefore there exists a set satisfying the definition given above.
