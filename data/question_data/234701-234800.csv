3,Problems with the definition of transitive relation,Problems with the definition of transitive relation,,"Recently I found this problem, which made me realize I have some problems with relations that are vacuously transitive. Problem: Assume that $R$ is a relation on $A$ and define the relation $S$ as  $$ S : = \{ (X, Y) \in \wp(A) \times\wp(A) : \exists x \in X, \exists y \in Y ((x,y) \in R) \}.$$ Statement: If $R$ is transitive, then $S$ is transitive. Is the statement true or false? Solution: I think that the statement is false, and working on a counterexample, I came up with the following relations, where the first picture represents the relation $R$, while the second picture represents the relation $S$. This should be a counterexample, because $R$ is transitive, while $S$ fails to be transitive.

If $x\in X$ we define the successor of $x$ by the formula: $\text{succ}(x):= \text{min}\big( ( x, +\infty ]\big)$ Exercise: If $x$ is an element of a well-ordered set $X$ show that exactly one of the following statements hold: 1.- (Limit Case) $x=\text{sup} \big( \,[\text{min}(X),x)\, \big)$ 2.- (Successor case) $x=\text{succ}(y)$ for some $y$. Hi everyone I have trouble with the above exercise. I'd like to put my attempt but  everything I've tried is wrong (Basically my idea is split the proof in two cases one to show that at most one case hold assuming by contradiction the opposite, and the other  which shows that at least one hold ). Also I don't have a real intuition about what the limit case really is, I mean,  with the successor case is easy only thinking in the natural numbers. But what about the limit case. (This is what I have so far) Sketch proof: We have to show that at most (1) or (2) hold. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that both cases occurs simultaneously. Let $P(x)$ be the statement ""$x$ is such that (1) and (2)  holds at the same time"". We set $\{x\in X: \,P(x)\,  \}$, then by hypothesis is a non-empty subset of $X$ which is well-ordered, then it has a minimum element $x$. Thus for all $x'< x$ either (1) or (2) holds but not both. We already know that $x= \text{min} ((y, +\infty])$, then $x$ is the least such that $x>y$. Thus $y$ is either in (1) or (2) but not at the same time. If $y$ is in (1).

Any suggestion, please? Thanks","Definitions : Given a subset $A$ of a non-empty well-ordered set $X$ we define the supremum as follows:  $\text{sup(A)}:=\text{min}\bigg(\big\{\,y\in X \oplus\{ +\infty\}: \forall x\in A \;(x\le y)\, \big \} \bigg)$. If $x\in X$ we define the successor of $x$ by the formula: $\text{succ}(x):= \text{min}\big( ( x, +\infty ]\big)$ Exercise: If $x$ is an element of a well-ordered set $X$ show that exactly one of the following statements hold: 1.- (Limit Case) $x=\text{sup} \big( \,[\text{min}(X),x)\, \big)$ 2.- (Successor case) $x=\text{succ}(y)$ for some $y$. Hi everyone I have trouble with the above exercise. I'd like to put my attempt but  everything I've tried is wrong (Basically my idea is split the proof in two cases one to show that at most one case hold assuming by contradiction the opposite, and the other  which shows that at least one hold ). Also I don't have a real intuition about what the limit case really is, I mean,  with the successor case is easy only thinking in the natural numbers. But what about the limit case. (This is what I have so far) Sketch proof: We have to show that at most (1) or (2) hold. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that both cases occurs simultaneously. Let $P(x)$ be the statement ""$x$ is such that (1) and (2)  holds at the same time"". We set $\{x\in X: \,P(x)\,  \}$, then by hypothesis is a non-empty subset of $X$ which is well-ordered, then it has a minimum element $x$. Thus for all $x'< x$ either (1) or (2) holds but not both. We already know that $x= \text{min} ((y, +\infty])$, then $x$ is the least such that $x>y$. Thus $y$ is either in (1) or (2) but not at the same time. If $y$ is in (1). This means that $y= \text{sup} ([\text{min}(X),y)$, i.e., $y$ is the least such as $y\ge w$ for all $w\in [\text{min}(X),y)$. Also we have that $y\in [\text{min}(X),x)$. We claim that $[\text{min}(X),x)=[\text{min}(X),y) \cup \{y\}$. Let $z\in [\text{min}(X),x)$, i.e., $\text{min}(X)\le z<x$, we have to check the case when $y\le z< x $ if were some $z\not= y$ contradicts that $x$ is the successor of $y$, hence $z=y$, the case when $z<y$ is trivially true. Hence $[\text{min}(X),x)\subset [\text{min}(X),y) \cup \{y\}$ the other inclusion is trivially true. Therefore $y$ is indeed an upper bound for  $[\text{min}(X),x)$ and also is the least, i.e., $y = \text{sup} ( \,[\text{min}(X),x)\,)$ and $y\not= x$ a contradiction. If $y$ is in (2), $y= \text{succ}(z)$. Then $y\ge w$ for all $w\in [\text{min}(X),y)= [\text{min}(X),z\,]$.

And find the following, the first part I think is not difficult at all. But for the converse I have some serious troubles to prove it. I have two questions: Is the following correct? and second, there is some constructive proof  for the second statement assuming that this is correct? Any advice, suggestion would be great. Thanks in advance Lemma : Suppose  $Y$ is a poset and let $X \subset Y$ be a finite totally ordered set. Then every non-empty subset of $X$ contains a minimum and maximum element. Conversely, if $X$ is a totally ordered set and every non-empty subset of $X$ has both minimum and maximum element. Then the set is finite. Proof: Suppose $X$ is a finite totally ordered set and let $P(n)$ be the statement: ""If $X$ is a finite totally ordered set with $n$ elements then every non-empty subset of $X$ contains a maximum and minimum element"". The assertion is vacuously true when $n=0$, since $X$ is empty and it does not contain a non-empty subset. Now suppose we have already proven the assertion for $n\ge 0$; we'd like to show that also is true when $\,\#X=n+1$. Clearly $X$ is a non-empty set, then it contain an element $x_0\in X$. Let define $X'= X \backslash \{x_0\}$. Then $X'$ contain $n$ elements and every non-empty subset of $X'$ contain a minimum and maximum element by the inductive hypothesis. Suppose $F$ is a given non-empty subset of $X$. Then either $x_0\in F$ or $x_0 \notin F$. For the former, let $F'= F\backslash \{x_0\}$, so $F'\subset X'$ and  contain a maximum and minimum element. Let $a$ and $b$ be the maximum and minimum element respectively. So, we need to compare $x_0$ with $a,b$ (this is always possible because $X$ is totally ordered) in the case that $a < x_0 $ or $x_0<b$ but not both at the same time (if were $a<x_0<b$, i.e., $a<b$ which is not possible ), we set this as the maximum or minimum element of the set. The case when $x_0\notin F$ is trivial because $F\subset X'$. Thus the claim hold in any case as desired. Conversely, suppose for the sake of contradiction that $X$ is an infinite totally ordered set and each non-empty set of $X$ contain a maximum and minimum element. We define the elements $x_n$ recursively by setting $x_0 = \text{min} (X)$ and $x_{n+1}= \text{min}(\{ x\in X: \forall i \le n\, (x\not=x_i) \})$. This definition is well-define since $X$ is assume to be an infinite set and each subset contain a minimum element by hypothesis. We claim that for all $n,m\in \mathbb{N}$ if $n<m$ then $x_n<x_m$. Let us fix $n$ an suppose by contradiction that exist an element for which the claim is false. Let $m_0$ be the least element. So, $x_n\ge x_{m_0}$ and $n< m_0$. Since $x_{n}<x_{n+1}$, then $m_0\not= n+1$. It follows that $m_0=k+1$ and thus $x_k<x_{m_0}$. By transitivity $x_k < x_n$ which contradicts the minimality of $m_0$. Then the result follows by reductio ad absurdum. Then we have and increasing sequence $x_0 < x_1 <...<x_n...$ of elements of $X$. Let define $(x_n):=\{x\in X: x\le x_n \}$ (notice that this sets are non-empty for all $n$) and $X':= \bigcup_{n=0}^\infty (x_n)$. Clearly $X'\subset X$, then it has a maximum element by hypothesis, let call it $x_{max}$. Then $x_{max} \in X'$, i.e., $x_{max} \in (x_n)$ for some $n\in \mathbb {N}$. But $x\le x_n$ and if we set some  $m>n$ we therefore have $x_{max}< x_m$ which is a contradiction.","Hi everyone is my second exercise of posets.

28,Does the center of a convex region lie within that region?,Does the center of a convex region lie within that region?,,"There's probably a simple result that says this is true, but I sure can't find it.  It seems obvious, though. Let $D$ be a closed, compact region in $\Re^n$.  Further, let $D \subseteq [0,l]^n$ and let $B_d^\epsilon(a)$ be an $\epsilon$-ball with distance metric $d$ (e.g., the 1-norm) centered at $a \in [0,l]^n$.  Let $C$ be the non-empty intersection of $B_d^\epsilon(a)$ and $D$.  The diameter of $C$ is defined as $diam(C) = \max_{x,x' \in C} d(x,x')$. Defined analogously, $diam(B_d^\epsilon(a)) = 2 \epsilon$ and $ diam(B_d^\epsilon(a))\geq diam(C)$. Does the set of points $X^* = argmin_{x\in B_d^\epsilon(a))}[\max_{x' \in C}d(x,x')]$ include an element of $C$?  Similarly, does there exist $x \in C$ s.t. $C \subseteq B_d^{\epsilon}(x)$? Can we find a proof that this is true for C convex? Remarks: What we're really trying to prove here is that $C$ lies within an $\epsilon$-ball of some point in its own interior if $C$ is convex. 1) We can construct examples with $C$ non-convex, such that the intersection of $X^*$ and $C$ is empty. 2) The minimizer of $d(x,x')$ for any $x'\in C$ is $x = x'$; the objective we're trying to minimize (itself convex) is a maximum over the loss incurred by any of infinitely many convex problems, each of which has its unique minimizer in $C$.  Is there a result which says that the minimum of such a problem is attained by $x \in$ the convex hull of the solutions of the subproblems (i.e., $C$ if it is convex)?  3) The minimizing set $X^*$ is the infinite intersection of $B_d^{r}(x) \forall x \in C$, where $r$ is the minimum value such that this infinite intersection is non-empty.  Since the individual balls are convex and compact, so is $X^*$.  Further, since $x \in C$, the intersection of each $B_d^{r}$ with $C$ is non-empty.

So, anyone with a) an authoritative source which confirms one of my missing links (or just gives the main result) or b) an independent proof?","There's probably a simple result that says this is true, but I sure can't find it.  It seems obvious, though. Let $D$ be a closed, compact region in $\Re^n$.  Further, let $D \subseteq [0,l]^n$ and let $B_d^\epsilon(a)$ be an $\epsilon$-ball with distance metric $d$ (e.g., the 1-norm) centered at $a \in [0,l]^n$.  Let $C$ be the non-empty intersection of $B_d^\epsilon(a)$ and $D$.  The diameter of $C$ is defined as $diam(C) = \max_{x,x' \in C} d(x,x')$. Defined analogously, $diam(B_d^\epsilon(a)) = 2 \epsilon$ and $ diam(B_d^\epsilon(a))\geq diam(C)$. Does the set of points $X^* = argmin_{x\in B_d^\epsilon(a))}[\max_{x' \in C}d(x,x')]$ include an element of $C$?  Similarly, does there exist $x \in C$ s.t. $C \subseteq B_d^{\epsilon}(x)$? Can we find a proof that this is true for C convex? Remarks: What we're really trying to prove here is that $C$ lies within an $\epsilon$-ball of some point in its own interior if $C$ is convex. 1) We can construct examples with $C$ non-convex, such that the intersection of $X^*$ and $C$ is empty. 2) The minimizer of $d(x,x')$ for any $x'\in C$ is $x = x'$; the objective we're trying to minimize (itself convex) is a maximum over the loss incurred by any of infinitely many convex problems, each of which has its unique minimizer in $C$.

Question : Is the following true for $m\ge 2$ ? $$k_{m,n}=k_{m-1,n}\left(k_{m-1,n}+1\right).$$ Motivation : I've been asking the following question on MSE and MO. What is the max of $n$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{1}{a_i}=1$ where $2\le a_1\lt a_2\lt\cdots\lt a_n\le 99$? This got me interested in $S_{m,n}.$ In the following, I'm going to prove that $S_{m,n}$ is a finite set. Proof : Let $S_{m,n}^{\gt}$ be the set of all solutions $\mathbf x=(x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_m)$ to the above equation such that $x_1\ge x_2\ge \cdots\ge x_m$ . Since any solution $\mathbf x$ is one that we can get from the elements of $S_{m,n}^{\gt}$ by exchanging its coordinates, we get $$|S_{m,n}|\le m! |S_{m,n}^{\gt}|$$ where $|S|$ represents the number of the elements of a set $S$ . Hence, in the following, let's prove that $S_{m,n}^{\gt}$ is a finite set for any natural number $n$ by induction on $m$ . The $m=1$ case is obvious. Then, let's suppose that $S_{m-1,n}^{\gt}$ is a finite set. Since $$\sum_{j=1}^{m-1}\frac1{x^j}=\frac1n-\frac1{x_m}=\frac{x_m-n}{nx_m},$$ we get $$\sum_{j=1}^{m-1}=\frac{1}{(x_m-n)x_j}=\frac{1}{nx_m}\ \ \ \ \cdots(\star).$$ Now, $x_m$ satisfies the following inequality : $$n+1\le x_m\le mn\ \ \ \ \ \cdots(\star\star).$$ This is because if we deny $(\star\star)$ , then $\mathbf x$ cannot be a solution of the equation. For a $x_m$ which satisfies $(\star\star)$ , the number of solutions $\mathbf x^{\prime}=\left((x_m-n)x_1,(x_m-n)x_2,\cdots,(x_m-n)x_{m-1}\right)$ which satisfies $(\star)$ is finite by the supposition. Since the number of $x_m$ which satisfies $(\star\star)$ is finite as well, $|S_{m,n}^{\gt}|$ is finite. Now the proof is completed. In the following, I'm going to represent $k_{3,n}$ by $n$ . First of all, note that $k_{2,n}=n(n+1)$ . Next, we know that $$\left(n(n+1)(n(n+1)+1),n(n+1)+1,n+1\right)\in S_{3,n}^{\gt}.$$ Hence, by the definition of $k_{3,n}$ , we get $$k_{3,n}\ge n(n+1)(n(n+1)+1).$$ Now, for any $\mathbf x=(x_1,x_2,x_3)$ , we get $(rx_1,rx_2)\in S_{2,n(n+r)}^{\gt}$ by $(\star)$ where $r=x_3-n$ and $1\le r\le 2n$ by $(\star\star).$ Hence, by the definition of $k_{m,n}$ , we get $$rx_1\le k_{2,n(n+r)}=n(n+r)(n(n+r)+1).$$ Hence, we get $$x_1\le \frac 1r n(n+r)(n(n+r)+1).$$ However, since $$n(n+1)(n(n+1)+1)-\frac 1r n(n+r)(n(n+r)+1)=\frac{1}{r}n^2(n^2-n+1)(r-1)\ge \frac 1r n^2(n^2-2n+1)(r-1)\ge 0,$$ we get $$x_1\le n(n+1)(n(n+1)+1).$$ After observing this question, I reached the above expectation.

At the moment I trying to prove the following proposition: For every one-to-one function $\: f:X \to Y \:$, and sequence of sets $\: B_n \subseteq X \:$, $$\: f \left[\bigcap_{n=0}^\infty B_n \right] = \bigcap_{n=0}^\infty f \left[B_n\right].$$ I was hoping to get some feedback on the proof. I suppose both in terms of content and form. Thanks! Proof. First, for some arbitrary $y \in Y$, suppose that $y \in f\left[ \bigcap_{n=0}^\infty B_n\right]$. Then, by definition, $\exists x \in \bigcap_{n=0}^\infty B_n$ such that $f(x) = y$. And, because we have an intersection, it follows that $\exists x : \forall n\, (x \in B_n)$. In that case, $y \in f\left[B_n\right]$ for each $n$. And therefore, $y \in \bigcap_{n=0}^\infty f\left[B_n\right]$. So we've shown that $y \in f\left[ \bigcap_{n=0}^\infty B_n\right] \implies y \in \bigcap_{n=0}^\infty f\left[B_n\right]$.

I suppose both in terms of content and form. Thanks! Proof. First, for some arbitrary $y \in Y$, suppose that $y \in f\left[ \bigcap_{n=0}^\infty B_n\right]$. Then, by definition, $\exists x \in \bigcap_{n=0}^\infty B_n$ such that $f(x) = y$. And, because we have an intersection, it follows that $\exists x : \forall n\, (x \in B_n)$. In that case, $y \in f\left[B_n\right]$ for each $n$. And therefore, $y \in \bigcap_{n=0}^\infty f\left[B_n\right]$. So we've shown that $y \in f\left[ \bigcap_{n=0}^\infty B_n\right] \implies y \in \bigcap_{n=0}^\infty f\left[B_n\right]$. Now, assuming that $f$ is one-to-one, suppose that we have $y \in f\left[B_n\right]$ for each $n$. So for all $n$, there is an $x \in X$ such that $f(x) = y$.

The set of all integers is countably infinite. Let $X$ and $Y$ be sets and suppose $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is surjective. If $X$ is countable, then $Y$ is also countable. The union of a countably infinite family of sets is countable. I'd like your opinion on my proofs. I feel like the first could be simpler. Exercise 1. The set $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$ is countable. Proof. Let $A_n=\{n\}\times\mathbb{Z}$ for each $n\in\mathbb{Z}$. Define a mapping $f:\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow A_n$ by $f(x)=(n,x)$ for all $x\in\mathbb{Z}$. To see that $f$ is surjective, consider $(n,p)\in A_n$. Since $p\in\mathbb{Z}$, $f(p)=(n,p)$.

Hence, $x=(n,p)$ for some $p\in\mathbb{Z}$. Therefore, $x=(n,p)\in\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$, and it follows that $U\subseteq\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$. Let $x\in\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$.

Why does this transfinite process converge? $\DeclareMathOperator{\ob}{ob}\DeclareMathOperator{\mor}{mor}$ It is easy to obtain an upper bound on the size of $\ob \mathcal{B}_\alpha$: by its very construction, $$\left| \ob \mathcal{B}_{\alpha+1} \right| \le \sum_{n < \aleph_0} \left| \ob \mathcal{B}_\alpha \right|^n + \left| \mor \mathcal{B}_\alpha \right|^2$$ and if we assume $\mathcal{B}_\alpha$ is non-empty, the inequality $\left| \ob \mathcal{B}_\alpha \right| \le \left| \mor \mathcal{B}_\alpha \right|$ then implies $$\left| \ob \mathcal{B}_{\alpha+1} \right| \le \sup \left\lbrace \left| \mor \mathcal{B}_\alpha \right|^n : n < \aleph_0 \right\rbrace \le \left| \mor \mathcal{B}_\alpha \right|^{\aleph_0}$$ which, while elegant, is not too useful since we can't bound $\left| \mor \mathcal{B}_{\alpha+1} \right|$ in terms of $\left| \ob \mathcal{B}_{\alpha+1} \right|$. It is conceivable that $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{A}$ are chosen in such a way that at each step $\alpha$, an object is added which vastly increases the size of $\mor \mathcal{B}_{\alpha+1}$. Nonetheless, I'm fairly confident the proposition is true. Adámek and Rosický even say that ""it is clear"" [LPAC, p. 17] (albeit with extra hypotheses on $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{C}$) and offer no proof.",,"['combinatorics', 'elementary-set-theory', 'category-theory', 'cardinals']"
85,Exponentiation and Set of Functions Notation.,Exponentiation and Set of Functions Notation.,,"Given arbitrary sets $A$ and $B$, the notation $A^{B}$ is mostly clear from context to mean $A^{B} = \{f : f : B \rightarrow A\}$. However, when these sets are ordinal or cardinals, especially $\omega$, the notation is not consistent even among subfields of logic. For example $2^\omega$ in one sense can denote ordinal exponentiation. Hence $2^\omega = \lim_{n < \omega} 2^n = \omega$. However, you can also consider $2^{\aleph_0}$. By using the cardinal $\aleph_0$, some people may consider it clear that $2^{\aleph_0}$ denotes the cardinal of the set $\{f : \aleph_0 = \omega_0 = \omega \rightarrow 2\}$. In the above paragraph $2^{\aleph_0}$ is a cardinal, (in ZFC) it is a special ordinal. However, it descriptive set theory, you may want to consider not the cardinal but Cantor Space (or Baire Space), i.e. the set of functions from $\omega \rightarrow 2$. When you want the set of functions as oppose to the ordinal, is there a notation for that. In recursion theory, I have found that $2^\omega$ or $\omega^\omega$ most frequently refers to Cantor or Baire space, and not the ordinal or cardinal. In Mostovachis book, he uses $\text{}^\omega2$ to denote Cantor Space. Does anyone know of any establish custom to distiguish between ordinal exponentiation, cardinality of the set of functions between ordinals, and the actual set of functions between ordinals. I was thinking perhaps the left right exponent like $\text{}^\omega2$ and $2^\omega$ could be used as distinction, but from reference to recursion theory and Moschivakis's book, it seems that this is not the case.

Is there a one, and are there inverses using only and , if there are, what would a system of equations look under that field. Can linear equations be solved not under a field? And can these equations be solved not under a field? If yes, what would the solution look like?","a_1x_1+a_2x_2+...+a_nx_n=b x_1, x_2,...,x_n a_1, a_2,..., a_n \cup \cap A\cup \varnothing=A a+0=a \varnothing \cup \cap","['linear-algebra', 'elementary-set-theory', 'set-theory', 'systems-of-equations']"

I've given the whole theorem below but want to emphasize that I am only interested in the uniqueness claim here. Asides in square brackets [] are given by me. 9.1 Theorem There is a smallest[in the sense that $\Bbb Z$ embeds into any other ] [integral] domain (commutative ring without zero divisors) with unity, $\Bbb Z$ , such that $\Bbb N \subset \Bbb Z$ [in the sense of there existing an isomorphic embedding $E_\Bbb Z: \Bbb N \to \Bbb Z$ ], and the ring operations on $\Bbb Z$ restrict to the usual operations on $\Bbb N$ . This ring is unique up to isomorphism and is called the ring of integers. Now lots is to be proved in the theorem above, so I want to emphasize again that with this question I am only interested in the last sentence: This ring is unique up to isomorphism and is called the ring of integers. [More precisely, we claim that $R$ and $\Bbb Z$ are isomorphic for any domain $R$ into which $\Bbb N$ embeds, and for which $R$ embeds into $S$ for any other domain $S$ into which $\Bbb N$ embeds.] I am hoping to summarize a proof strategy: is the following correct? My proof strategy: Let us say that a domain $S$ is smallest (in our present context) if $\Bbb N$ embeds into $S$ with $E_S$ and if, for any other domain $R$ such that $E_R: \mathbb{N}\to R$ is some embeddings of the naturals, then a unique embedding $F_{S,R}: S\to R$ is induced which (*, this will be used later) restricts to that of $E_R: \mathbb{N}\to R$ (that is, for all $n \in \Bbb N$ , $F_{S,R} \mid_{E_S(\mathbb{N})}(E_S(n)) = E_R(n)$ ). (1) Show that $\Bbb Z$ is a smallest domain. Proof .  Omitted. (2) Suppose that $S$ is a smallest domain. Then $\Bbb Z \cong S$ . Proof .  We have by hypothesis and (1) that there exist unique embeddings $F_{S,\Bbb Z}, F_{\Bbb Z,S}$ . Since both embeddings are (by part of the definition of embedding) injective, it is sufficient to verify that $F_{S,\Bbb Z} \circ F_{\Bbb Z,S} = I_\Bbb Z$ in order to show that $F_{\Bbb Z,S}$ has an inverse (and is thus bijective, and so an isomorphism since it's already a homomorphism). Thus we let $a \in \Bbb Z$ and note that by definition of $a$ there exist naturals $m,n$ such that $a = [(m,n)]$ . By basic properties in $\Bbb Z$ we have $$a = [(m,n)] = [(m,0)] + [(0,n)] = [(m,0)] + (-[(n,0)]) = E_\Bbb Z (m) - E_\Bbb Z (n).$$ Then, calculating, we find that $$F_{S,\Bbb Z} \circ F_{\Bbb Z,S}(a) = F_{S,\Bbb Z}(F_{\Bbb Z,S}(a)) = F_{S,\Bbb Z}(F_{\Bbb Z,S}(E_\Bbb Z (m) - E_\Bbb Z (n))) = F_{S,\Bbb Z}(F_{\Bbb Z,S}(E_\Bbb Z (m)) - F_{\Bbb Z,S}(E_\Bbb Z (n))) \stackrel{(1)}{=} F_{S,\Bbb Z}(E_S(m) - E_S(n)) \stackrel{(1)}{=} E_\Bbb Z (m) - E_\Bbb Z (n) = a,$$ where we have made various uses of the homomorphism properties of the $F_i$ and where in the crucial steps marked (1) we have used the property (*) above.

(2) In my definition of smallest above (developed after a discussion with others), I mention that ""then a unique embedding $F_{S,R}: S\to R$ is induced"". Where is this hypothesis about the embedding being unique used or needed (not a question about whether it's true or not)?
