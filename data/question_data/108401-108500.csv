0,A question on the proof of the De Bruijn-Erdos theorem,A question on the proof of the De Bruijn-Erdos theorem,,"I just read a very short paper on the De Bruijn-Erdos theorem. It essentially states that if we have $n$ points and $m$ lines, where any two points lie on a line, and each line has at least two points, then there are at least as many lines as points. The proof is in this short paper . It is stated at the very top, and the proof I'm curious about begins in the middle of page 2 and ends at the top of page 3. I don't quite follow the inequalities  $$ s_j\leq k_n\ \text{for}\ j>\nu $$ that are found at the very top of page 3. Why would that fact that an index $j$ being greater than the minimum number of lines passing through a given point require that the number of points on that indexed line is at most the number of lines passing through that point? Apart from that I follow the rest. Does it violate one of the assumptions about the space? Thanks.","I just read a very short paper on the De Bruijn-Erdos theorem.

14,Is it possible to define a space and/or a distance function such that there is always more than 1 shortest path between any 2 points?,Is it possible to define a space and/or a distance function such that there is always more than 1 shortest path between any 2 points?,,"I am in my second semester of university in maths and physics and thought of a question I am unable to answer. I asked my analysis teacher of the last semester if it was possible to define a space and/or a distance function such that there is always more than 1 shortest path between any 2 points. She thought about it and then she told me she didn't know. Firstly, I thought that maybe it would be possible if you could define the distance between two points in Q'XQ U QXQ' only by going through points (a,b) such that either a is rationnal and b irrational or a irrational and b rationnal, but she told me that there would be no way to connect the points if we use only those points. ({(a,b)|a is rational and b is irrational or a is irational and b is rational}) However, I know that it is possible in special cases. A very simple example of this is that any 2 opposite points on a sphere has infinitely many shortest path between them. However, if the points are not opposite, then there is only one shortest path between them. It is possible to create as many shortest paths as wanted between some 2 points on a surface, for example you can take the shape of an american football ball, put point 1 on one edge and point 2 on the other edge, and dig into the ball so that there are 2 ways to get from one edge to another. You can repeat this processus to create as many paths as you want between the 2 points on the edges. These are only special cases though, and my question remain unanswered. So I thought about it and found a possible candidate. Could the distance calculated as the lenght of the circle arc between 2 points work? For example, in R^2, you would get two shortest paths from one point to another. I believe it respects the usual definition of distance: It's always positive, the distance is equal to zero iff it is the distance from point a to point a, it is symmetric, d(a,b)=d(b,a) and the triangular inequality should be sastified. The problem I encountered though, is that to create this circle you would need to first find the middle point between the 2 points and then put each point that will form the path from point 1 to point 2 at an equal distance to the middle point, and I believe it does not make sense as we are using normal euclidian distance. I know this question lacks a lot of rigor and I don't even know if it makes sense asking it. For example I would need to define what I mean by a path. I believe requiring continuity would make sense but I'm not sure about the rest. I would be very grateful if you had any documentation related to this or the answer to my question. Thank you.

If we have a primitive Pythagorean triple $(a, b, c)$ , let $CD = 1$ and hence $ED = a/b$ . It also follows that $EC$ is rational of course. In fact, using the similarity of $\Delta AFE$ and $\Delta ECD$ , all of the sides will also be rational numbers except for $FC$ .

Thus we need $(b^2)^2 + (a^2 - ab + b^2)^2 = k^2$ for some positive integer $k$ for $FC$ to be rational: Using Euclid's formula for Pythagorean triples, one option is that $p^2 - q^2 = b^2; \ 2pq = (a^2 - ab + b^2); \ p^2 + q^2 = k$ , where integers $p > q > 0$ and $p, q$ are of opposite parity (otherwise the triple will not be primitive). Wolfram Alpha then uses the quadratic formula to tell me that $a = \frac{1}{2} \left(b \pm \sqrt{-3p^2 + 8pq + 3q^2} \right)$ , which simplifies to $a = \frac{1}{2} (b \pm \sqrt{(3q - p)(3p + q)})$ .

For any $\displaystyle 0 \le x \le \frac{3 \sqrt{3}}{4}$ we can ask the minimum perimeter $f(x) $ and maximum perimeter $g(x)$ of triangles with area $x$ inscribed in a circle of radius $1$ .

37,Help me verify whether my solution of this geometry problem is correct,Help me verify whether my solution of this geometry problem is correct,,"Consider the following problem. The Problem Point $B$ lies on the segment $AC$ . A tangent line is constructed from point $A$ to the circle of diameter $BC$ , intersecting it at point $M$ . $K$ is the second point of intersection of line $AM$ with the circle of diameter $AB$ . The extension of segment $MB$ intersects the circle of diameter $AB$ at point $D$ . a) Prove $AD\parallel MC$ . b) Find the area of $DBC$ if $AK=5$ and $MK=25$ . My Drawing My Solution a) $\angle ADB = \angle BMC = 90^\circ$ as inscribed angles subtended by the diameter are always right. As $\angle ADB$ and $\angle BMC$ are alternate interior angles of a transversal intersecting two lines $AD$ and $MC$ , and as they are equal, then, by Proposition 27 of Euclid (one of criterion for parallel lines) these lines are parallel, i.e. $AD\parallel MC$ , QED. b) Because $AD\parallel MC$ , $DAMC$ is a trapezoid with bases $AD$ and $MC$ . As per properties of a trapezoid, its diagonals divide its interior region into four triangles: two triangles that include one of this trapezoid's bases are similar, and two other triangles have the same area. Thus, to find the area of triangle $_\Delta DBC$ , it's sufficient to find the area of a triangle $_\Delta ABM$ , as their areas are equal. In $_\Delta ABM$ , we can immediately find side $AM=5+25=30$ . We now find the altitude to that side in order to find out the area of this triangle. This altitude is $BK$ , as $\angle AKB = 90^\circ$ as an inscribed angle subtended by the diameter. Let $\angle AMB = \alpha$ . This is the angle between tangent $AM$ and chord $MB$ , thus, by the alternate segment theorem, it is equal to the angle in the alternate segment $BM$ . Thus, $\angle BCM = \angle AMB = \alpha$ . Then $\angle CBM=90^\circ - \alpha$ as triangle $CMB$ is a right triangle (established in a) earlier), and sum of acute angles in a right triangle is always $90^\circ$ . Now, $\angle KMB=\angle ABM$ because point $K$ lies on a line $AM$ between points $A$ and $M$ . Therefore, $\angle KBM=\angle CBM=\alpha$ . Because triangle $MKB$ is also a right triangle, then $\angle MBK=90^\circ-\alpha=\angle CBM$ . Thus, by axiom of angle measurement, $\angle CBK=\angle MBK+\angle CBM=90^\circ-\alpha+90^\circ-\alpha=180^\circ-2\alpha$ . Now, as $\angle ABK$ is adjacent to $\angle CBK$ , it's true that $\angle ABK+\angle CBK=180^\circ$ . Therefore, $\angle ABK=2\alpha$ . As triangle $AKB$ is a right triangle as $BK\perp AK$ , it's true that $\angle BAK=90^\circ-2\alpha$ . Let's now express $\tan\alpha$ in terms of some sides. By definition of a tangent of an acute angle of a right triangle, it's the ratio of the opposite leg to the adjacent leg. Therefore, from triangle $MKB$ , $\tan\alpha=\dfrac{BK}{MK}=\dfrac{BK}{25}$ . By one of the phase shift identities, $\tan(90^\circ - 2\alpha)=\cot 2\alpha$ . By the double-angle identity for cotangent, $\cot 2\alpha=\dfrac{1-\tan^2\alpha}{2\tan\alpha}$ . From the right triangle $ABK$ and the definition of tangent, we also have $\tan(90^\circ - 2\alpha)=\tan\angle BAK=\dfrac{BK}{AK}=\dfrac{BK}{5}$ . Therefore, it's true that $\cot 2\alpha=\dfrac{BK}{5}$ . Let $\tan\alpha = x$ , and $BK = y$ . We now solve the system of equations from what we have got earlier: $$ \begin{cases} x=\dfrac{y}{25}, \\ \dfrac{1-x^2}{2x} = \dfrac{y}{5}; \end{cases} \Rightarrow \begin{cases} y=25x, \\ y=5\cdot\dfrac{1-x^2}{2x}; \end{cases} \Rightarrow 25x = 5\cdot\dfrac{1-x^2}{2x}. $$ We now solve the equation for $x$ : \begin{align*} 25x &= 5\cdot\dfrac{1-x^2}{2x} \\ 5x &= \dfrac{1-x^2}{2x} \\ 10x^2 &= 1-x^2 \\ 11x^2 &= 1 \\ x^2 &= \dfrac{1}{11} \end{align*} That means $\tan^2\alpha=\dfrac{1}{11}$ . We know $\alpha$ is an acute angle, so $\tan\alpha > 0$ . Then, we will take the positive root: $\tan\alpha=\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{11}}$ . Now we can find $BK$ . \begin{align*} \tan\alpha &= \dfrac{BK}{25} \\ \dfrac{BK}{25} &= \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{11}} \\ BK &= \dfrac{25}{\sqrt{11}} \end{align*} We can now find the area of a triangle $_\Delta ABM$ : $$ S_{_\Delta ABM} = \dfrac{1}{2}\cdot AM\cdot BK = \dfrac{1}{2}\cdot 30\cdot \dfrac{25}{\sqrt{11}} = \dfrac{375}{\sqrt{11}} $$ Therefore, as $S_{_\Delta ABM}=S_{_\Delta DBC}$ , we conclude that $S_{_\Delta DBC}=\dfrac{375}{\sqrt{11}}$ .

The answer to the question is apparently 66° if that helps anyone with reverse checking their math or anything.",,"['geometry', 'spherical-coordinates', 'spherical-geometry']"

54,Simplest function sufficient to categorize a square,Simplest function sufficient to categorize a square,,"Background Let $p_i=(x_i,y_i)$ with $i\in \{1,2,3,4\}$ define four (possibly repeating) points in the plane. Let $f(a,b,c)$ be any function with the property that $$f(a,b,c)=f(a,c,b)=f(b,a,c)=f(b,c,a)=f(c,a,b)=f(c,b,a)$$ That is, the output of $f$ is independent on any permutations of the inputs. Finally, define $$S_1=f(d(p_1,p_2),d(p_1,p_3),d(p_1,p_4))$$ where $d(a,b)$ is the standard Euclidean distance (although this could really be any metric). In a similar manner, define $S_2,S_3,$ and $S_4$ . We say that a function $f$ categorizes a square if $$S_1=S_2=S_3=S_4\Leftrightarrow \text{The points }p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4\text{ define a square}$$ Obviously, the $\Leftarrow$ implication is self-evident (at least if one considers four identical points a square). This leaves the question of what functions $f$ imply that the points $p$ form a square? Question: What is the simplest such function $f$ which categorizes a square? In this question, 'simple' can be taken to mean: cleanest, neatest, easiest to compute, etc. Work so far: The obvious choice for $f$ is $$f(a,b,c)=a+b+c$$ By almost any definition, this is probably the simplest function which could possibly categorize a square (this is opposed to constant $f$ which definitely does not categorize the square).

We say that a function categorizes a square if Obviously, the implication is self-evident (at least if one considers four identical points a square).

In this question, 'simple' can be taken to mean: cleanest, neatest, easiest to compute, etc. Work so far: The obvious choice for is By almost any definition, this is probably the simplest function which could possibly categorize a square (this is opposed to constant which definitely does not categorize the square).

Above I have attached a picture of what my approach to it was. I extedended the median $BM$ by $2$ times and obtained parallelogram $ABCD$ . We then have $\angle BAD=60^\circ$ . Letting $\angle ADB=\theta$ and using the Sine Rule, I get $$\frac{\sin(60^\circ)}{4}=\frac{\sin(\theta)}{10}$$ However, this does not seem to yield any real value for $\theta$ .
