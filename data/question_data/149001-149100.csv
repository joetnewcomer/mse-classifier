0,Using DeMoivre's Theorem to prove some identities regarding trigonometric functions,Using DeMoivre's Theorem to prove some identities regarding trigonometric functions,,"The following question is from a previous post. The reason that I am posting this again is because it had two questions which were not really related and hence, one of the questions was not answered.

The question has three parts and is as follows: By equating imaginary parts in DeMoivre's formula, prove that $$\sin{\left(n\theta\right)} = \sin^n\theta \left\lbrace \binom{n}{1}\cot^{n - 1}\theta - \binom{n}{3} \cot^{n - 3}\theta + \binom{n}{5} \cot^{n - 5}\theta - + \cdots \right\rbrace$$ If $0 < \theta < \dfrac{\pi}{2}$ , prove that $$\sin{\left(\left( 2m + 1 \right)\theta\right)} = \sin^{2m + 1}\theta P_m(\cot^2\theta)$$ where $P_m$ is the polynomial of degree $m$ given by $$P_m\left( x \right) = \binom{2m + 1}{1}x^m - \binom{2m + 1}{3}x^{m-1} + \binom{2m + 1}{5}x^{m-2} - + \cdots$$ Use this to show that $P_m$ has zeros at $m$ distinct points $x_k = \cot^2\left( \dfrac{\pi k}{2m + 1} \right)$ for $k = 1, 2, \dots, m$ .

But let's start at the beginning. Let $\mu: P(\mathbb{R}) \to [0, ∞]$ be a measure that satisfies the following conditions: $(*) \mu([0, 1]) = 1$ and $\mu(x + A) = \mu(A)$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}, A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. The assignment asks me to consider the equivalence relation $x \sim y :<=> x - y \in \mathbb{Q}$ Out of every equivalence class, we choose a representative $x \in [0, 1]$. Let $X \subseteq [0, 1]$ be the set of representatives that we got that way. I am now to consider the sets $\mathbb{R} = \cup_{x \in X} (x + \mathbb{Q})$ and $\mathbb{R} = \cup_{q \in \mathbb{Q}} (X + q)$, and find a contradiction by showing that $\mu$ would need to satisfy both $\mu(X) = 0$ aswell as $\mu(X) > 0$. What I've shown so far: I showed that $\mu(\mathbb{R}) = ∞$ (using the fact that $[0, 1]$ is sent to $1$), aswell as that $\mu(\{a\}) = 0$ for all $a \in \mathbb{R}$. From this, it also follows that all countable subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ are sent to $0$ by $\mu$ (so especially $\mu(\mathbb{Q}) = 0$). I've also shown that, since $\mu(\cup_{q \in \mathbb{Q}} (X + q)) = ∞$ and since $\cup_{q \in \mathbb{Q}} (X + q)$ is a countable, disjoint union, we have that $\mu(X) > 0$. The only part I'm still missing is to show that $\mu(X) = 0$ via the fact that $\mathbb{R} = \cup_{x \in X} (x + \mathbb{Q})$, as written above. I just can't get my head around how I could show this. $\cup_{x \in X} (x + \mathbb{Q})$ is a disjoint, but uncountable union because $X$ contains uncountably many elements; therefore, we can't use the $\sigma$-additivity of a measure. I see that $\mu(x + \mathbb{Q}) = 0$ for each $x \in X$, because $\mathbb{Q})$ is countable, but I don't know how that helps me. I've also thought about decomposing $[0,1]$ into a disjoint union of sets, but that didn't lead anywhere so far. If we ""remove"" countably many points of $[0,1]$, the remaining set would still be sent to $1$ by $\mu$, for the reasons given above. So how could I conclude that $X$ must be sent to $0$? I'm out of ideas.","The goal of this task given to me is to show that there is no (non-trivial) translation invariant measure on $P(\mathbb{R})$, the power set of $\mathbb{R}$, and I think I almost completed it, but I just can't find a way to prove the very last bit that's missing.

The question is about (most probably) an elementary inequality: Is it always true that  $x^p+y^p\leq (x+y)^p$ ? Note that if $p$ is any positive integer, then the above inequality is obviously correct. What about if the number $p \ (\text{with} \ p>1)$ is any non-integer real number? I guess that (by my intuition) the answer should be positive. But how can we proceed to prove this inequality?",,"['real-analysis', 'analysis', 'inequality']"

I can provide more of my attempt if necessary.","I've been working on this problem for several hours, but I keep getting stuck. Suppose $f_1, f_2 : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ periodic with period $1, \sqrt{2}$, respectively, and that each of $f_1, f_2$ is nonconstant, continuous. Then $f_1 + f_2$ is not periodic. My thoughts so far: Suppose $p$ is the period of $f_1 + f_2$. I want to use the fact that $\{n\sqrt{2}\}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}/(x \sim x+p)$ to come up with a contradiction. I've tried numerous paths, which would take forever to write up. Now I'm just hoping to find the solution.

96,Equivalence of seminorms of Schwartz space,Equivalence of seminorms of Schwartz space,,"I have seen the definitions of the family of seminorms defined on Schwartz spaces vary slightly in literature. For example the following $$\rho_{a,b}(f) = \sup_{x\in \mathbb{R}^n}|x^aD^bf(x)|,$$ $$\hat{\rho_{a,b}}(f) = \sup_{x\in \mathbb{R}^n}|x|^{|a|}|D^bf(x)|$$ and $$\tilde{\rho_{a,b}}(f) = \sup_{x\in \mathbb{R}^n}(1+|x|)^{|a|}|D^bf(x)|,$$ where $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$, and $a$ is multiindex. How can I show the equivalence of these definitions? And another question would be whether we have $$\sup_{a,b\in\mathbb{N}}\rho_{a,b}(f)=M<\infty$$ for $f\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^n)$. Thank you.","I have seen the definitions of the family of seminorms defined on Schwartz spaces vary slightly in literature.

98,Generalization of Bernoulli's Inequality.,Generalization of Bernoulli's Inequality.,,"When you're first taking an Introduction to Proofs class, you eventually learn about induction. One of the first induction proofs I did was to prove for $n \geq 1$ that $(1+x)^n \geq 1+nx$. You first prove the base case, $n=1$, which yields $(1+x)^1 \geq 1+1x$, which is true. Then you assume that the inequality holds for for the arbitrary $n$ case. Then you try to prove that the inequality holds for $n+1$, i.e. $(1+x)^(n+1) \geq 1+nx$ as well. Using our assumption that $(1+x)^n \geq 1+nx$, we can multiply both sides by $1+x$, which yields $(1+x)*(1+x)^n \geq (1+nx)*(1+x).$ Since $1+nx^2+nx +x \geq 1+(n+1)x$, the inequality is proven. Now what I’m trying to do is prove a generalization of Bernoulli’s inequality, i.e. the following. “Find the least possible $\alpha < 0$ so that $\forall x \geq \alpha$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$, that $(1+x)^n \geq 1+nx$. Prove the inequality as well as prove that your $\alpha$ is best possible.” What I’m trying to figure out is what is more special about this question rather than the typical inductive Bernoulli’s inequality proof? What is the purpose of introducing this alpha restricted to less than zero? There must be a reason for it. I read a few different textbooks and they all say that it (it referring to Bernoulli's inequality) works for $x > -1$, so I’m assuming that the alpha would also be -1 because then for any $x \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $x \geq \alpha$, the normal Bernoulli’s inequality holds. Am I completely going off the deep end? Any input would be very much appreciated.","When you're first taking an Introduction to Proofs class, you eventually learn about induction.

99,Proof that $f'(x) = g'(x)$ if and only if $f = g + c$,Proof that  if and only if,f'(x) = g'(x) f = g + c,"Good evening, I need to prove that $f'(x) = g'(x)$ for all $x \in (a,b)$ if and only if there exist a $c \in \mathbb{R}$ with $f = g+c$. We know that $f:[a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and $g:[a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ are continuous and differentiable on $(a,b)$. My attempt: Define $t(x):=c$ Let $t:[a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be continuous and differentiable on $(a,b)$. $t'(x)=0$ for all $x \in (a,b)$ $\Rightarrow t(x)=c$ , $c \in \mathbb{R}$ for all $x \in [a,b]$. Proof (with contraposition): assume that $t(x)$ isn't $const$ on $[a,b]$ $\Rightarrow \exists x_0 \in [a,b]$ that $t'(x_0) \neq 0$ Under the assumption there exists a $x,y \in [a,b] : f(x) \neq f(y)$ $w.l.o.g.$ assume that $x<y \Rightarrow (x,y) \leq (a,b)$ $\Rightarrow t(x)$ is differentiable on $(x,y)$ and continuous on $(x,y) \leq (a,b)$ With the mean value theorem $\Rightarrow \exists  \eta_0 \in (x,y): t(y)-t(x) = t'(\eta_0) \cdot (y-x)$ Under the assumption we know that $(y-x) > 0$ and $t(y)-t(x) \neq 0$. $\Leftrightarrow \frac {t(y)-t(x)}{y-x} = t'(\eta_0) \Rightarrow f'(\eta_0) \neq 0 \Rightarrow Assumption.$ Now since we know that the differentiation of a constant function is zero we can define our $c:= f-g \Rightarrow f'(x)-g'(x)= 0 \Rightarrow f'(x) = g'(x)$.
