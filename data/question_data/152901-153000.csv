Therefore, $a_{m,1}=1$ is true $\forall m\geq 2$ where $m \in \mathbb{Z}^+$, I'd like to know whether this conjecture is true. If so, it would be nice if a proof was provided. Therefore, here I show my thoughts on the problem: The process on $(1)$ of course should be applied recursively to obtain an expression for the elements on the first row.

Therefore, I decided to abandon using this idea. Somebody had suggested that I use Bertrand's Postulate . I will use the weaker form of the theorem, which states that if $p_n$ is the $n$-th prime, for all $n\geq 1$, then: $$p_{n+1}<2p_n$$ In that case, I figured that if I apply this on the series with increasing powers of $2$, then: $$\begin{matrix} \color{#007777}{1} & & \color{#777700}2 & & \color{green}{4} & & \color{orange}8 && 16 & \cdots \\ & \color{#007777}1 && \color{#777700}2 && \color{green}4 && \color{orange}8 \\ && \color{#007777}1 && \color{#777700}2 && \color{green}4 \\ &&& \color{#007777}1 && \color{#777700}2 \\ &&&& \color{#007777}1 \end{matrix}$$ Then each of the columns will have identical values as shown by the different colors above. I figured this was quite similar, and since $p_n\leq 2^n$ where $n\in \mathbb{Z}^+$, thus this would be true for the primes as well. However, it seems doubtful because the differences are not strictly increasing as we can see in the $2^{\text{nd}} \text{ difference}$ in the prime number series and also, we are taking the absolute value of the differences recursively as shown on the example on $(2)$. Therefore, I do not think Bertrand's Postulate can be applied directly as I have done. In summary, I'd like to know whether the conjecture is true. If so, a proof would be nice.

27,The famous prime race and generalizations,The famous prime race and generalizations,,"So I was messing around with the famous prime race that comes down to this: We make a list of primes. The list has two rows; the top row is for primes $1\mod 4$ and the bottom row for primes $3\mod 4$. Our list, up to the 10th prime: 5  13  17  29 3   7  11  19  23  31 The idea is that the two rows are ""racing"" to be longest, and the bottom row always seems to be winning. An intuitive visual representation of this would be, we start at $0$ on the number line, and start going through the primes. Whenever we encounter a prime $1\mod 4$ we do a step right, and whenever the prime is $3\mod 4$, we do a step left. This is not quite such an interesting visualization however; it's just a line. However, this becomes more interesting when we generalize it. The generalization. We generalize this by picking a number, and do the prime race $\mod n$. Apart from a couple (certainly finite number of) exceptions, all primes fit in one of the $\varphi(n)$ categories. With this, I mean, let $U(n)=\{u_1,u_2,\cdots,u_{\varphi(n)}\}$ with $0\leq u_i<n$, and $i<j\iff u_i<u_j$, and $\gcd(u_i,n)=1$, then each $u_i$ represents a category; all primes $p$ (except for the ones that are divisors of $n$) must have $p\equiv u_i\mod n$ for exactly one $u_i$. Now we start going through the primes, and whenever we encounter a prime $p\equiv u_i\mod n$, we take a step length $1$ in the direction $\tfrac{2i\pi}{\varphi(n)}$. An example, $n=8$. This is a relatively easy example to try on grid paper, since $\phi(8)=4$, so we have $4$ directions to go in. For the first $10^3$, $10^4$ and $10^5$ primes, this looks like this (the red dot is the starting point, the blue dot is the end. Open the image in a new tab to see it at full resolution) Interestingly enough, the red dot, the start, is in all images the right-most point in the entire thing, even though it is seemingly random. So this is the case for $n=4$, and for $n=8$. Maybe it's the powers of $2$, let's try $n=10$ (which happens to have $\phi(10)=4$ as well). We get (again, for the first $10^3$, $10^4$ and $10^5$ primes): We see this time it's tending more to the bottom-left rather than just the left; but again, one side (the top-right) remains untouched. Let's try this again, but this time with an $n$ without $\phi(n)=4$. We try $n=11$ through $n=15$: $n=11$ $n=12$ $n=13$ $n=14$ and $n=15$ We see $n=12$ is very convincingly going to the left and not touching the right, and $n=15$ is leaning towards the top-left, and leaves the bottom-left almost untouched. $n=11$, $n=13$ and $n=14$ however there's no specific way the blob seems to lean. Question. Why do the blobs with $\varphi(n)=4$ lean so convincingly to one side, while not even touching the other? Do there exist similar patterns for other $n$ with different $\varphi$? Are they related to the fact that the $\varphi$ is a power of $2$ (since $n=15$ has similar behaviour)? I expected them to stay around the middle a lot more since the density of the primes $\mod n$ is evenly spaced, that is, picking any prime, it has chance $\frac{1}{\varphi(n)}$ to be $i\mod n$ (where $\gcd(i,n)=1$).","So I was messing around with the famous prime race that comes down to this: We make a list of primes.

We try $n=11$ through $n=15$: $n=11$ $n=12$ $n=13$ $n=14$ and $n=15$ We see $n=12$ is very convincingly going to the left and not touching the right, and $n=15$ is leaning towards the top-left, and leaves the bottom-left almost untouched. $n=11$, $n=13$ and $n=14$ however there's no specific way the blob seems to lean. Question. Why do the blobs with $\varphi(n)=4$ lean so convincingly to one side, while not even touching the other? Do there exist similar patterns for other $n$ with different $\varphi$? Are they related to the fact that the $\varphi$ is a power of $2$ (since $n=15$ has similar behaviour)? I expected them to stay around the middle a lot more since the density of the primes $\mod n$ is evenly spaced, that is, picking any prime, it has chance $\frac{1}{\varphi(n)}$ to be $i\mod n$ (where $\gcd(i,n)=1$).",,"['number-theory', 'elementary-number-theory']"
28,Find All $x$ values where $f(x)$ is Perfect Square,Find All  values where  is Perfect Square,x f(x),"Is there a formula, method or anyway to find all positive $x$ integer values (if exists) such that $f(x)$ is Perfect square where $f(x)$ is a quadratic equation? For example if I have the following function: \begin{align*}      f(x)= 4x^2+84x-15 \end{align*} Then I need all integer x values which makes $f(x)$ Perfect Squares. I know for this equation $x \in \{2,10,19,47\}$ but I knew this by guessing, I mean I wrote a program in java and I traversed all of x values from 1 to 1000 and I got this set of x values that gives me a perfect square, I am not sure if I have to go further and what is the bound to do this guessing. But I am not interested in such method.

Update 2 After reading @ColmBhandal note I am trying in this update to transform the original equation to another equation. Resolving the new equation will resolve the previous equation. Since $a$ in my case is always square then to get $x$ where $f(x)$ a perfect square we need to resolve the following: \begin{align*} bx+c=2nsx+n^2\  where\ s=\sqrt{a},\ n >= 1, n\in\mathbb Z \end{align*} Therefore \begin{align*} x=g(n)=\frac{n^2-c}{b-2sn}\tag{2} \end{align*} Now this is a Diophantine equation in the following form (assign $x=Y$ and $n=X$): \begin{align*} X^2-bY+2sXY-c=0\tag{3} \end{align*} Now we need to find $n$|$n>1\ and\ n\in\mathbb Z$ which makes $g(n)\in\mathbb Z$. Let's note the following: $n$ has min value when $numerator = denominator$ (this happens to get $n=1$)which is \begin{align*} n^2-c = b-2sn  \end{align*} \begin{align*} n^2+2sn-b-c = 0\implies\ n>= \Bigg\lceil {\frac{-(2s)+\sqrt{(2s)^2-(4(-b-c))}}{2}}\ \Bigg\rceil \end{align*} $n$ has a max value when the $denominator=0$ which is \begin{align*} b-2sn=0\implies n < \frac{b}{2s} \end{align*} We can get the first biggest two $n$ values because we know $x_1$ and $x_2$. So for the mentioned example since $a=4$ then $s=2$ which lets $x=g(n)$ is \begin{align*} g(n)=\frac{n^2+15}{84-4n}\quad where\ n\in\mathbb Z, 7<=n<21 \end{align*} We also know that $n_1=19\ and\ n_2=17$ because $x_1=47\ and\ x_2=19$ so actually we are looking for $n$ (if exists) \begin{align*} 7<= n < 17\ |\ n\in\mathbb Z \end{align*} So we need now the integer solutions for this equation. I hope this equation now could be resolved, I think it is a Diophantine Equation and we need integer solutions for it because the equation looks like: \begin{align*} x^2-84y+4xy+15=0 \end{align*} Update 3 After reading this paper , I found (on page 6) that equation (3) could be transformed to \begin{align*} (bx + e)(by + d) = ed − bf \end{align*} Then writing $ed − bf = N$ and if $N$ is not zero (which is in our case) then we can factorize N to get all integer solutions.

30,Does the category of algebraically closed fields of characteristic $p$ change when $p$ changes?,Does the category of algebraically closed fields of characteristic  change when  changes?,p p,"EDIT I've now posted this question on mathoverflow . It probably makes sense to post answers over there, unless someone prefers posting here. Let $\mathrm{ACF}_p$ denote the category of algebraically closed fields of characteristic $p$, with all homomorphisms as morphisms. The question is: when is there an equivalence of categories between $\mathrm{ACF}_p$ and $\mathrm{ACF}_l$ (with the expected answer being: only when $p=l$)? Here are some easy observations: First, any equivalence of categories must do the obvious thing on objects, preserving transcendence degree because $K$ has a smaller transcendence degree than $L$ if and only if there is a morphism $K \to L$ but not $L \to K$. We can distinguish the case $p=0$ from the case $p \neq 0$ because $\mathrm{Gal}(\mathbb{Q}) \not \cong \mathrm{Gal}(\mathbb{F}_p)$. But $\mathrm{Gal}(\mathbb{F}_p) \cong \hat{\mathbb{Z}}$ for any prime $p$. So we can't distinguish $\mathrm{ACF}_p$ from $\mathrm{ACF}_l$ for different primes $p \neq l$ in such a simple-minded way. So for the rest of this post, let $p,l$ be distinct primes. The next guess is that maybe we can distinguish $\mathrm{ACF}_p$ from $\mathrm{ACF}_l$ by seeing that $\mathrm{Aut}(\overline{\mathbb{F}_p(t)}) \not \cong \mathrm{Aut}(\overline{\mathbb{F}_l(t)})$. To this end, note that there is a tower $\mathbb{F}_p \subset \overline{\mathbb{F}_p} \subset \overline{\mathbb{F}_p}(t) \subset \overline{\mathbb{F}_p(t)}$. The automorphism groups of these intermediate extensions are respectively $\hat{\mathbb{Z}}$, $\mathrm{PGL}_2(\overline{\mathbb{F}_p})$, and a free profinite group (the last one is according to wikipedia ). From (3), there is at least a subquotient $\mathrm{PGL}_2(\overline{\mathbb{F}_p})$ which looks different for different primes. But I don't see how to turn this observation into a proof that $\mathrm{Aut}(\overline{\mathbb{F}_p(t)}) \not \cong \mathrm{Aut}(\overline{\mathbb{F}_l(t)})$ specifically, or that $\mathrm{ACF}_p \not \simeq \mathrm{ACF}_l$ more generally. Note that if we change ""algebraically closed fields of characteristic $p$"" to ""fields of characteristic $p$"", then its easy to distinguish these categories because their subcategories of finite fields look very different. Also, there is a natural topological enrichment of $\mathrm{ACF}_p$ where one gives the homset the topology of pointwise convergence.

So as to have a more concrete question, I will ask this in the context of the Tate conjectures. As I understand, one way to state the Tate conjectures is that $A^j(X)\otimes_{\mathbb{Q}} \mathbb{Q}_l$ (where $A^j(X)$ is the image in $H^{2j}(X,\mathbb{Q}_l)$ of the algebraic cycle classes with coefficients in $\mathbb{Q}$) is isomorphic to $(V^j)^G$ where $V^j$ is $H^{2j}(X,\mathbb{Q}_l)(j)$ (the $j^{th}$ Tate twist).

Let $A$ be a Dedekind domain with fraction field $K$ and $L/K$ a finite separable field extension of degree $n$, and let $B$ be the integral closure of $A$ in $L$, which is then also a Dedekind domain. Let $X=\text{Spec}(B)$ and $Y=\text{Spec}(A)$, and consider the projection $X\to Y$ which sends a prime $\mathfrak{q}\in X$ over $\mathfrak{p}\in Y$ to $\mathfrak{p}$ (i.e., the map of affine schemes corresponding to the inclusion $A\to B$). Let $\mathfrak{p}\in Y$ be a non-zero prime ideal in $A$. The fiber over $\mathfrak{p}$ is then the set of prime ideals $\mathfrak{q}_{i}\in X$ such that $$ \mathfrak{p}B=\mathfrak{q}_{1}^{e_{1}}\cdots \mathfrak{q}_{g}^{e_{g}}$$ is the corresponding prime factorization in $B$ (uniquely determined, because $B$ is a Dedekind domain). Let $f_{i}=[\kappa(\mathfrak{q}_{i}):\kappa(\mathfrak{p})]$ be the corresponding residue degrees. Then: $$\sum_{i=1}^{g}f_{i}e_{i}=n$$ We say that $\mathfrak{q}_{i}$ is ramified above $\mathfrak{p}$ if the ramification index $e_{i}$ is strictly greater than 1, and unramified if $e_{i}=1$. We say that $\mathfrak{p}$ is unramified in $B$ if all $e_{i}=1$; that $\mathfrak{p}$ splits in $B$ if all $e_{i}=f_{i}=1$; and we say that $\mathfrak{p}$ is inert in $B$ if $g=e_{1}=1$. We can picture both $X$ and $Y$ as algebraic curves and $X$ as a ramified cover of $Y$. I am trying to understand the precise geometric meaning of all the previous definitions in terms of this geometric picture. My professor said that ramified primes above $\mathfrak{p}$ are those points $\mathfrak{q}_{i}\in X$ where the fiber over $\mathfrak{p}$ meets $X$ in a tangent point (I understand that by fiber he means the vertical line above $\mathfrak{p}$ when we picture $Y$ as a straight line). I tried to match this interpretation with the example of $A=\mathbb{Z}$ and $B=\mathbb{Z}[i]$, based on the picture of $\text{Spec}(\mathbb{Z}[X])$ of Mumford: Prime ideals in $\mathbb{Z}[i]=\mathbb{Z}[X]/(X^{2}+1)$ should correspond to prime ideals containing $(X^{2}+1)$. That is, they should correspond to points in the curve $V(X^{2}+1)$ drawn in the picture. The picture above $(2)$ matches this interpretation perfectly, since $(2)$ ramifies in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$. And so does the picture above $(5)$, since $(5)$ splits into two primes in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$. But now I have a problem with the picture above $(3)$. There should be only one point, namely $(3,X^{2}+1)\in X$, but I guess Mumford just doesn't draw it. But even if he did, how would he draw this point without creating a singularity on the curve? Because, being the spectrum of a Dedekind domain, $X$ should be a regular curve, right? So how would we draw this point? But if you draw this point in the naive way, introducing a singularity, suddenly the residue degree seems to make some geometric sense to me: it seems to be the number of parameters that we need to describe the curve around the corresponding point. How much of this naive impression is true? Is this just a coincidence? Because algebraically this doesn't make much sense to me. One should be able to describe the curve locally with a single parameter, because all the local rings are DVR. I will try to summarize all these doubts in the following question: What is the precise geometric meaning of the ramification index and the residue degree? Finally, if possible, I would like to hear some clarification comments on the source that started all these doubts (initially I was naively happy with my professor's interpretation): Neukirch's Algebraic Number Theory . In chpater I, Section 13 (One-dimensional Schemes) he draws this ramification situation: I have several problems with this picture. Shouldn't $X$ be a regular curve? Why aren't the ramification points tangent, as my professor claimed them to be? If this is really the picture, how do we distinguish geometrically between inert points and ramification points? For example, the point on the right. Is it inert or is it ramified? Neukirch says that this picture is only a fair rendering of the algebraic situation when the residue fields in $A$ are algebraically closed, but this doesn't help much to answer the previous questions. Thanks for the spending the time to read this long question. I am quite confused with this issue and I wanted to express my doubts as clear as possible.","I am trying to understand geometrically the ramification of primes in a finite separable field extension. Let $A$ be a Dedekind domain with fraction field $K$ and $L/K$ a finite separable field extension of degree $n$, and let $B$ be the integral closure of $A$ in $L$, which is then also a Dedekind domain. Let $X=\text{Spec}(B)$ and $Y=\text{Spec}(A)$, and consider the projection $X\to Y$ which sends a prime $\mathfrak{q}\in X$ over $\mathfrak{p}\in Y$ to $\mathfrak{p}$ (i.e., the map of affine schemes corresponding to the inclusion $A\to B$). Let $\mathfrak{p}\in Y$ be a non-zero prime ideal in $A$. The fiber over $\mathfrak{p}$ is then the set of prime ideals $\mathfrak{q}_{i}\in X$ such that $$ \mathfrak{p}B=\mathfrak{q}_{1}^{e_{1}}\cdots \mathfrak{q}_{g}^{e_{g}}$$ is the corresponding prime factorization in $B$ (uniquely determined, because $B$ is a Dedekind domain). Let $f_{i}=[\kappa(\mathfrak{q}_{i}):\kappa(\mathfrak{p})]$ be the corresponding residue degrees. Then: $$\sum_{i=1}^{g}f_{i}e_{i}=n$$ We say that $\mathfrak{q}_{i}$ is ramified above $\mathfrak{p}$ if the ramification index $e_{i}$ is strictly greater than 1, and unramified if $e_{i}=1$. We say that $\mathfrak{p}$ is unramified in $B$ if all $e_{i}=1$; that $\mathfrak{p}$ splits in $B$ if all $e_{i}=f_{i}=1$; and we say that $\mathfrak{p}$ is inert in $B$ if $g=e_{1}=1$. We can picture both $X$ and $Y$ as algebraic curves and $X$ as a ramified cover of $Y$.

With PFGW we arrived to $k=565000$ and all the $n's$ congruent to $6 \pmod 7$ are composite. According to Giovanni Resta's calculations in a post which has been canceled, there should be no probable prime congruent to 6 $\pmod 7$ upto k=800.000. The residue $6$ $\pmod 7$ occurs when either $m=6t+3$ and $k=3l+1$ or $m=6t+4$ and $k=3l+2$ with $k$ and $l$ some non-negative integers, but amazingly when it occurs the number is not prime.

Prove that if $a<p$ and $ m \ | \ \phi(n)$ then $n$ is prime. This question is a generalisation of the question at Let $n=apq+1$. Prove that if $pq \ | \ \phi(n)$ then $n$ is prime. . Here the special case when $m$ is a product of two distinct odd primes has been proven. The case when $m$ is a prime power has also been proven here https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.02327 . How do we prove that the proposition holds for an arbitrary positive integer integer $m>1 $ ? ( I have not found any counter - examples). Note that if $n=am+1$ is prime, we have $\phi(n)= n-1=am$ . We see that $m  \ | \ \phi(n) $ . Its the converse of this statement that we want to prove i.e. If $m  \ | \ \phi(n) $ then $n$ is prime. If this conjecture is true, then we have the following theorem which is a generalisation  ( an extension) of Lucas's converse of Fermat's little theorem. $\textbf {Theorem} \ \  1.$ $ \ \ \ $ Let $n=am+1$ , where $a$ and $m>1$ are positive integers and let $p$ be the least prime divisor of $m$ with $a<p$ . If for each prime $q_i$ dividing $m$ , there exists an integer $b_i$ such that ${b_i}^{n-1}\equiv 1\ (\mathrm{mod}\ n)$ and ${b_i}^{(n-1)/q_i} \not \equiv 1(\mathrm{mod}\ n)$ then $n$ is prime. Proof. $ \ \ \ $ We begin by noting that ${\mathrm{ord}}_nb_i\ |\ n-1$ . Let $m={q_1}^{a_1}{q_2}^{a_2}\dots {q_k}^{a_k}$ be the prime power factorization of $m$ . The combination of ${\mathrm{ord}}_nb_i\ |\ n-1$ and ${\mathrm{ord}}_nb_i\ \nmid (n-1)/q_i$ implies ${q_i}^{a_i}\ |\ {\mathrm{ord}}_nb_i$ . $ \ \ $${\mathrm{ord}}_nb_i\ |\ \phi (n)$ therefore for each $i$ , ${q_i}^{a_i}\ |\ \phi (n)$ hence $m\ |\ \phi (n)$ .

I found this relational expression by using computer. Then, I got interested in the generalization of this expression. After receiving an answer, I decided to start an easy example. First, I got the following with a proof: $$\lfloor\sqrt n+\sqrt {n+1}\rfloor=\lfloor\sqrt {4n+1}\rfloor=\lfloor\sqrt{4n+2}\rfloor.$$ Note that $\lfloor x \rfloor$ is the largest integer not greater than $x$. Proof : By the AM-GM inequality, we get $n\lt\sqrt{n(n+1)}\lt n+1/2$. Then, we get $$4n+1\lt\left(\sqrt n+\sqrt{n+1}\right)^2=4n+2-2\left(n+1/2-\sqrt{n(n+1)}\right)\lt4n+2. $$ By the way, there are no perfect squares in $\left(4n+1, 4n+2\right].$ (since $k^2\equiv0, 1(mod 4)$ for any natural number $k$, there is no natural number $k$ such that $k^2=4n+2$.) Now, the proof is completed. Second, I've just got new relational expressions by using computer: $$\lfloor\sqrt{n}+\sqrt{n+1}+\sqrt{n+2}\rfloor=\lfloor\sqrt{9n+8}\rfloor,$$ $$\lfloor\sqrt{n}+\sqrt{n+1}+\sqrt{n+2}+\sqrt{n+3}\rfloor=\lfloor\sqrt{16n+20}\rfloor$$ for any natural numbre $n$. I won't ask these expression because I'm going to prove these by myself. Third, I haven't got any expression about 'six terms expression'. Then, I expect the following theorem would be proven true: Theorem : For any real number $c$, there exists a natural number $n$ such that $$\lfloor\sqrt{n}+\sqrt{n+1}+\sqrt{n+2}+\sqrt{n+3}+\sqrt{n+4}+\sqrt{n+5}\rfloor\not=\lfloor\sqrt{36n+c}\rfloor.$$ Then, here is my question.
