6,Why do solutions to first order autonomous ODEs tend towards equllibria?,Why do solutions to first order autonomous ODEs tend towards equllibria?,,"Consider a first order autonomous ODE: $$\frac{dy}{dt}=f(y)$$ The solutions to this ODE cannot cross each other due to the Picard-Lindelöf theorem (lets say this ODE satisfies it). Also note that, because the sign of $f(y)$ can only change at the zeros and the function can't cross the zeros since they are (equilibrium) solutions, $f(y)$ is monotone. These two reasons put together mean that any solution to a 1st order autonomous ODE are bounded by the equilibrium solutions that surround them: p and q are equilibrium solutions, i.e. f(p)=f(q)=0. This is what my introductory textbook on differential equations and all the online resources I could find say about the subject. What I don't get is how they go further and say that the limit of these bound solutions approach the equilibria as $t\to\infty$ or $-\infty$ depending on if $f(y)$ is decreasing or increasing or, if there is no bounding equllibrium solution, $f(y)$ approaches $\pm\infty$ . I mean I believe them, and it certainly seems intuitive, yet I don't see how monotonicity and not being able to cross over guarantee this alone.

10,Transforming a nonlinear system to a new system that has an equilibrium point at the origin,Transforming a nonlinear system to a new system that has an equilibrium point at the origin,,"Take a look at the following system $$ \begin{align} \dot{x}_1 &= x_2\\ \dot{x}_2 &= -x_1 + x^3_1 - x_2 \end{align} $$ which has three equilibrium points (0,0),(1,0), and (-1,0). In the book I'm reading, the author asks to define a new system that has equilibrium point as the origin for (1,0) and (-1,0). The procedure in the book is as follows:  let $y=x-x_e$ where $x_e$ is an equilibrium point and let's perform the transformation for $x_e = (1,0)$ , hence: $$ \begin{align} y_1 &= x_1 - (1) = x_1 - 1 \implies \dot{y}_1 = \dot{x}_1 \\ y_2 &= x_2 - (0) = x_2  \implies \dot{y}_2 = \dot{x}_2 \end{align} $$ The new system is now $$ \begin{align} \dot{y}_1 &= y_2 \\ \dot{y}_2 &= -(y_1+1) + (y_1+1)^3 - y_2 \end{align} $$ Now we need to show that the new system $\dot{y}=g(y)$ has an equilibrium point at the origin (i.e. $\dot{y}=g(y) \implies 0 = g(y_e)$ ), we get $$ \begin{align} 0 &= y_2 \\ 0 &= -(y_1+1) + (y_1+1)^3 + y_2 \end{align} $$ $y_2=0, -(y_1+1) + (y_1+1)^3 = 0 \implies y_1=0,-2$ .

Using Gronwall’s inequality, show that the solution emerging from any point $x_0\in\mathbb{R}^N$ exists for any finite time. Here is my proposed solution. We can first write $f(x)$ as an integral equation, $$x(t) = x_0 + \int_{t_0}^{t} f(x(s)) ds$$ where the integration constant is chosen such that $x(t_0)=x_0$ . WLOG, assume that $t_0=0$ . Then, \begin{equation} \begin{split} ||x(t)|| & = ||x_0 + \int_{0}^{t} f(x(s)) ds|| \\  & \leq ||x_0|| + ||\int_{0}^{t} f(x(s)) ds|| \\  & \leq ||x_0|| + \alpha\int_{0}^{t} ||x(s)|| ds  \end{split} \end{equation} Therefore, by the integral form of Gronwall's inequality , we see that \begin{equation} \begin{split} ||x(t)|| & \leq ||x_0|| + \alpha\int_{0}^{t} ||x(s)|| ds \\  & \leq  ||x_0||e^{\alpha(t)} \end{split} \end{equation} So, if we let $M = ||x_0||$ , then $||x(t)||\leq{{M}e^{\alpha(t)}}$ . Therefore, the solution is uniformly bounded on $[0,t]$ for $t>0$ . As $t>0$ was arbitrary, the solution is defined for all positive values of $t$ . We can then analyze what happens for negative values of $t$ by reversing time and applying the same argument to $[-t,0]$ . Once again assume that $t_0=0$ .

Then $e^{\Delta}=Q (Q^{-1} e^{\Delta} Q)Q^{-1}=Q (E) Q^{-1}=E$. A similar conclusion holds for $B$ and $A+B$. Since $\Delta$ is the canonical form $e^{t\Delta}$ it has polynomials $\frac{t^{m}}{m!}$ outside the diagonal if there is a Jordan-Block, but by evaluating on $t=1$ we find that they must be zero, so the matix $\Delta$ must be a diagonal one. And using the complex exponential we conclude that the eigenvalues of $A$ are of the form $i 2\pi k$. And that is as far as I go, I have tried some matrices but they all appear to commute. I try using Zassenhaus' formula, but no luck. Thanks.",,"['linear-algebra', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'matrix-exponential']"

36,Query on converting a differential equation to Sturm-Liouville Form,Query on converting a differential equation to Sturm-Liouville Form,,"I have a query on Sturm-Liouville operators written in a textbook that I am currently using for my course on Mathematical Methods in Physics. In the book, I do agree that Sturm-Liouville equations take the form of $p(x) \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + r(x) \frac{dy}{dx} + q(x)y + \lambda \rho(x) y = 0$ whereby  $r(x)=\frac{dp(x)}{dx}$ However, in the portion written in the book, it says that any $2^{\text{nd}}$ order differential equations in the form $p(x) \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + r(x) \frac{dy}{dx} + q(x)y + \lambda \rho(x) y = 0$ can be converted into Sturm-Liouville form by multiplying through by a suitable integrating factor, which is given by $F(x)=\exp\int^{x}{\frac{r(u)-p'(u)}{p(u)}du}$ to give the Sturm-Liouville (S-L) form $[F(x)p(x)y]'+F(x)q(x)y+\lambda F(x)\rho(x)y=0$ with a different but still non-negative weight function $F(x)\rho(x)$. My question now here is, why a different weight factor? If so, what is the point of writing $\rho(x)$ in the non-(S-L) form anyway? To my knowledge, I think that when we are solving an eigenvalue equation associated with a differential operator, it is always in the form of $Ly=\lambda y$, where $L$ refers to the differential operator. So I believe that the starting equation here should not be $p(x) \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + r(x) \frac{dy}{dx} + q(x)y + \lambda \rho(x) y = 0$ but rather, $p(x) \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + r(x) \frac{dy}{dx} + q(x)y + \lambda y = 0$ that is equivalent to solving an eigenvalue equation $Ly=\lambda y$ (apart from the negative sign in $\lambda$) Hence, the integrating factor $F(x)$ to convert a non-(S-L) differential operator $L$ in $Ly=\lambda y$ is the weight function as I feel that $F(x)Ly=\lambda F(x)y$ => $L'y=\lambda F(x)y$, where $L'$ is the new differential operator in S-L form. Indeed, if we compare with the initial form $p(x) \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + r(x) \frac{dy}{dx} + q(x)y + \lambda \rho(x) y = 0$ equivalent to $Ly=\lambda \rho(x) y$, we should deduce that $\rho(x) = F(x)$, i.e. $F(x)$ is the weight function in this case right? Or am I misinterpreting the proposed form from the book that I am referring to? Should there always be a $\rho(x)$ in a general $2^{\text{nd}}$ order ODE when we are trying to solve the eigenvalues in the initial step?  Thank you. PS: Sorry for the long question!
