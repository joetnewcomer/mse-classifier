38,Introductory Induction proof that $n(n^2 +5)$ is divisible by $6$,Introductory Induction proof that  is divisible by,n(n^2 +5) 6,"I am in currently in a discrete mathematics class, and I've done well on every problem I've encountered. Unfortunately, I find myself weak at some of the seemingly straight forward induction problems. As is the case of the following corollary. I will attempt to show as far as I've gotten in the problem and where I have hit a road block. Theorem: $n(n^2 +5)$ is divisible by 6 for every integer $n\ge0$ Proof: Let the property $P(n)$ be the sentence ""$n(n^2 +5)$ is divisible by 6."" For our base case we will show that $P(0)$. That is, $0(0^2 +5)$ is divisible by 6. But, $0(0^2 +5)=0$ so $P(0)$ says that $0$ is divisible by 6 which is clearly true because $0$ is divisible by all integers as was previously shown in our text. Now, for our inductive step we must show that $P(k) \Rightarrow P(k+1)$. Now, by definition of divisibility, $P(k)$ says that $k(k^2 +5) =6r$ for some $r\in \mathbb Z$ (EDIT AFTER HINT). Also, $P(k+1)$ says that $(k+1)[(k+1)^2 +5]=6p$ for some $p\in \mathbb Z$. After expansion and substitution $(k+1)[(k+1)^2 +5 = k^3 + 3k^2 +8k +6 = (k^3 +5k)+3k^2 +3k +6 = 6r +3k^2 +3k + 6= 3(2r +k^2 + k +2)=3(2r+k(k+1)+2)$ However, note that $k(k+1)$ represents the pruduct of two consecutive integers and is thus even. That is, $k(k+1)=2q$ for some $q\in \mathbb Z$. Now, $2r+k(k+1)+2 = 2r+2q+2$, but this is simply the sum of three even numbers and is thus an even number itself. That is, $2r+2q+2 = 2p$ for some $p\in\mathbb Z$. Therefore, $(k+1)[(k+1)^2 +5] =6q$. EDIT:PROBLEM SOLVED - This is where I get stuck I've tried to expand $(k+1)[(k+1)^2 +5]$ which gives me $k^3 + 3k^2 +8k +6$. I've tried to manipulate it so that $k^3 + 3k^2 +8k +6=(k^3 +5k)+3k^2 +3k +6 = 6r +3k^2 +3k + 6= 3(2r +k^2 + k +2)$. However, this only shows divisibility by 3. Any help would be much appreciated.

I have answers, I just want to make certain that I answered them properly, used the proper reasoning to answer them, and used the terminology correctly. For a): For elements in the poset to be a maximal element, it has to be divisible by all the elements it is comparable to. The elements 24 and 45 are maximal, because they are divisible by every element they are comparable to. The reason why neither maximal element is comparable to the other is because $24|45$ and $45|24$ are both false statements. For b): For elements in the poset to be minimal, is for them to be able to divide all other elements, in the relation, they are comparable to. $3|5$ and $5|3$ are both false statements, meaning they are incomparable elements, and since they divide every element they are comparable, they are minimal elements of the poset. For c): No, because 24 and 45 are incomparable elements, meaning one doesn't precede the other. For d): No, because 3 and 5 are incomparable elements, meaning one doesn't precede the other. For e): To find the upper-bound of the set $\{3,5\}$, with respect to the poset, is to find all of the elements that both 3 and 5 divide. These elements are 15 and 35. For f): To find the least upper-bound of the set $\{3,5\}$, is to consider the upper-bounds, and find the one that divides the others. $15|45$, so 15 is the least upper-bound. For g): To find the lower bounds of the set $\{15,45\}$, with respect to the poset, is to find the eleents that divide into 15 and 45. These elements are 3,5, and 15. For h): To find the greater lower bound of the set $\{15,45\}$, is to consider the lower bounds, and see which one is divisible by them all. $3|15$ and $5|15$, therefore 15 is the greatest lower bound. I have a few other questions. If you have more than one extremal element, is it possible to have a greatest or least element?

I do potentially see that we could 'fit' an infinite amount of reals in a finite space of length 1, in some sense; however, the act of collecting them cannot be performed in a real world time, and this doesn't work to explain the set of all real numbers, or the set of all natural numbers- I fail to see how it is possible to collect them.

First observation: if we start writting the string from the right if we get one number where it gives you wrong output(unequal) then there is no point to stretch it to left any further as the numbers are inductive. e.g: $11$ is wrong so $011$ or $....11$ will be wrong 2nd observation: We can't start with $1$ from the right if $n>1$ 3rd observation:From the right we can go on putting (even)zeros and then if you put a single $1$ that is ok but you can't put more than then wrong e.g: $1100,0100$ wrong. This doesn't apply if we put odd zeros as $11000$ is right. 4th observation: If we put from right $0$ then $1$ and go on writing (even) 1 then we can alternate $0$ and $1$ after that and we can write same number of (even) zeros after (even) ones but we can't extend it any further e.g $1010110$ , $00110$ are right but $000110$ , $100110$ are wrong. 5th observation: If we put from right $0$ then $1$ and go on writing (odd) 1 then we are allowed to put only one zero after that and anything we put after that will give us wrong answer e.g $01110$ is right but both $101110$ and $001110$ are wrong.
