0,Definition of a locally lifted measure,Definition of a locally lifted measure,,"I have just begun studying $g$ -measures, and thought it a good idea to study Keane's paper [1], where they were first introduced. However, I almost immediately stumbled upon a concept I am not familiar with, which is crucial to understanding the motivation for the rest of the paper. The setting is as follows: Let $(X,T)$ be a dynamical system, where $X$ is a compact metric space $(X,d)$ , and $T$ is a minimal covering transformation. By this we (read Keane) mean that: $T$ is everywhere $n$ -to-1 ( $n\geq 2$ ). $T$ is a local homeomorphism. There exists a $C>1$ , such that for all $x\in X$ there exists a $\delta_x>0$ , such that $d(x,y)<\delta_x\implies d(Tx,Ty)\geq Cd(x,y)$ . For all $\varepsilon>0$ there exists a $N\in\mathbb N$ , such that $T^{-N}(x)$ is $\varepsilon$ dense in $X$ , for all $x$ . Now comes the concept I am not familiar with: Keane states that, for any measure $\mu$ on $X$ we can denote the measure on $X$ ""obtained by lifting $\mu$ locally by $T^{-1}$ by $Q\mu$ "". What exactly is this $Q\mu$ ? My first thought was that $Q\mu$ was simply the pushforward $T_*\mu$ (defined by $T_\mu(A)=\mu(T^{-1}(A)))$ , which agrees with his next line: ""The total mass of $Q\mu$ is $n$ times that of $\mu$ "". However this is a global construction, and so does not lend itself to the use of the word ""local"". My other thought is that $T$ being a minimal covering transformation allows us to construct a partition $X=\bigsqcup_{i=1}^nX_i$ , where for each $i$ , $T|_{X_i}$ is a homeomorphism. Let us denote each such restricted function by $T_i$ . We can then define $Q\mu$ by $$Q\mu(A)=\sum_{i=1}^n\mu(T_i(A\cap X_i)).$$ This is most probably my best guess as to how $Q\mu$ is supposed to be defined, but I haven't proven rigorously yet that $T$ being a covering transformation allows such a decomposition (but it seems entirely natural that it should). I will be very appreciative if someone can definitively tell me what the correct definition of $Q\mu$ should be. [1] Keane, Michael , Strongly mixing g-measures , Invent. Math. 16, 309-324 (1972).

Consider $L^\infty(X)$ as a Banach lattice with the usual ordering. As an exercise in Operator Theoretic Aspects of Ergodic Theory by Eisner et. al we are asked to show that $L^\infty(X)$  does not have an order continuous norm. By order continuous norm I mean that if $(f_n)\subset L^\infty(X)$ is a sequence such that $f_{n+1}\leq f_n$ and $\inf f_n=0$ implies $\|f_n\|\to 0$. Now it is easy to construct a specific example that is not order continuous. Take for example $X=[0,1]$, $\Sigma$ the Borel $\sigma$-algebra and $\mu=\lambda$. If we consider $(f_n)=(\mathbf{1}_{[0,1/n]})$ we see that this space cannot be order continuous.

In Takesaki's book Theory of Operator Algebra's, he shows that any Stonean space can be decomposed into three parts: a hyperstonean part, a part with a dense meagre set and a part where every regular positive measure has a nowhere dense support. Let's call these Type A,B and C. Type A is a von Neumann algebra, while type B and C allow no normal states, so they are in a certain sense maximally non-von Neumann. A Type C Stonean space doesn't allow a faithful state, since all states/measures have nowhere dense support. My question is: Is there a Type B commutative AW$^*$-algebra that has a faithful state?

81,Lebesgue's original definition of a measurable set?,Lebesgue's original definition of a measurable set?,,"There are many ways to construct the Lebesgue measure, and different definitions are available for a subset $A\subset\mathbb{R}$ to be 'measurable'. I believe the most common definition is to use Caratheodory extension theorem involving the concept of an outer-measure; Royden's book uses this definition. Another way to construct the Lebesgue measure is to first define a positive linear functional on $C_c(\mathbb{R})$ using the Riemann integration, and then applying the Riesz representation theorem on locally compact Hausdorff spaces; Rudin's book uses this approach, but I personally think that this is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.

Then $$f \in L^3(\mu) \implies \|f\|_3 < \infty \implies \|f^3\|_1 = \|f\|^3_3 < \infty  \implies f^3 \in L^1(\mu).$$ My issue: I don't feel like this proof is complete or correct; I didn't use the fact that $(X, \mathcal{M}, \mu)$ is a complete measure space (at least, not explicitly; if I implicitly assumed it, I'm unsure where), and I'm not confident that my first and last implications are correct (I'm used to seeing things like $L^3[0, 1]$, but not $L^3(\mu)$). My request: If anyone could guide my apparent misunderstandings of the concepts used here, I would greatly appreciate it. If I'm on the wrong track, I'd also appreciate a nudge in the right direction (but NOT a full solution).

93,Doubling measure implies doubling metric space,Doubling measure implies doubling metric space,,"I have the following as an exercise. A measure $\mu$ is doubling if there exists a constant $c_d$ such that $\mu(B(x,2R)) \leq c_d \mu(B(x,R))$ for all balls in the metric space. The claim is that this implies the metric space is doubling, that is there exists $N\in \mathbb{N}$ such that a ball of radius R can be covered with at most $N$ balls of radius $R/2$. I tried proving this indirectly: Suppose you need countably many balls of radius $R/2$ to cover a ball of radius $R$: $$\bigcup_{i=1}^N B(x_i,R/2) \subset B(x,R) \Rightarrow \mu\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^N B(x_i,R/2)\right) \leq \mu(B(x,R)) $$ for all $N$. Then I would use doubling condition to see that $\mu(B(x,R)) \geq \infty$ which is a contradiction. However, I don't know how to get sum of measures between the inequality. I was also thinking that maybe I can arrange balls $B(x_i,R/2)$ such a way that every ball covers alone some set of positive measure, so that the measure of $B(x,R)$ would again be infinite, but I couldn't figure out that rigorously. (How I ensure that there wouldn't be alot of of non-open sets to cover after some point?) I also thought that maybe it should be proven directly using $$ c_1\left(\dfrac{r}{R}\right)^{Q_1} \leq \dfrac{\mu(B(x,r))}{\mu(B(y,R))} \leq c_2\left(\dfrac{r}{R}\right)^{Q_2},  $$ but again I didn't figure out how to control overlapping in the covering.
