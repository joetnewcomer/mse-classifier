66,Are the trigonometric functions really Elementary Functions?,Are the trigonometric functions really Elementary Functions?,,"The wikipedia page for Elementary Function defines it as follows. In mathematics, an elementary function is a function of one variable which is the composition of a finite number of arithmetic operations (+ – × ÷), exponentials, logarithms, constants, and solutions of algebraic equations (a generalization of nth roots). It goes on to say the following about trigonometric functions. The elementary functions include the trigonometric and hyperbolic functions and their inverses, as they are expressible with complex exponentials and logarithms. However, the trigonometric function definitions I have seen do not appear to satisfy the 'Elementary Function' requirements . Here are two definitions I've seen alongside my objections on why the definition does not appear to be Elementary. The relevant section of the Trigonometric Functions wikipedia page includes the following definitions of $\sin$ and $\cos$. $$\cos x = \operatorname{Re}(e^{i x})$$ $$\sin x = \operatorname{Im}(e^{i x})$$ My objection: the definition uses the $\operatorname{Re}$ and $\operatorname{Im}$ operators, which do not appear to be Elementary Functions themselves according to the definition. Also, the Wolfram Research Functions site lists the following sum as a definition for $\sin$. $$\sin z = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^k z^{2 k + 1}}{(2 k + 1)!}$$ My objection: an infinite number of operations are used, which is in violation of the definition. Is the wikipedia article correct in asserting that the trigonometric functions are indeed Elementary? If so, how can one construct the trigonometric functions using a finite number of compositions of elementary operations? A side note: In addition to the objections listed above, it seems strange that $e$ -- being transcendental and therefore not constructible using finite compositions of the elementary operations -- could be used as a constant in the construction of other elementary operations.

Is there any way I can figure out the values of $x$ where $\cos x$ is transcendental or do I have to check individually for every $x$ whether it is or not?,For what values of $x$ is $\cos x$ transcendental? Is there any way I can figure out the values of $x$ where $\cos x$ is transcendental or do I have to check individually for every $x$ whether it is or not?,,"['trigonometry', 'transcendental-equations', 'transcendence-theory']"
98,Two trigonometrical answers for same exercise. Which is the right one?,Two trigonometrical answers for same exercise. Which is the right one?,,"I'm trying to resolve a trigonometrical exercise. I have two ways to resolve it and I receive two different answers. If you could help explain me why one way is a wrong way to resolve it (without doing reference to the trigonometric functions please). Using double-angle formulas one way is: \begin{align} \cos(2x) = \cos^2x \\ \ 2\cos^2x -1 = \cos^2x \\ \ \cos^2x - 1 = 0 \\ \ \cos^2x = 1 \\ \ x = 360^\circ k \end{align} The second way is: \begin{align} \cos(2x) = \cos^2x \\ \ \cos^2x - \sin^2x = \cos^2x \\ \ -\sin^2x = 0 \\ \ \sin^2x = 0\\ \ x = 180^\circ k \end{align} As you see there are two answers, I know that the last one is the right one but don't know why (please don't do reference to the graphs).","I'm trying to resolve a trigonometrical exercise.
