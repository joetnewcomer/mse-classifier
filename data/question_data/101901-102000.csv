So, can anybody tell me if this problem is complete and solvable, if yes, is my method correct (see below), if no, what is the best/better method to solve it. MY METHOD: As all the triangles with their areas given are on the edge of the rectangle, we know that they all are right triangles .

Lets take a as altitude and b as base . (Here’s the first part of the trick ) We now try all possible _a_s and _b_s for the three triangles, where a and b are natural numbers only . (This is also where the major weakness of my method is. More numbers, i.e., any real numbers should have been tried, but that is infeasible).

The condition we require: When the triangles are placed together to form a quadrilateral the opposite sides of it must be equal. If this quadrilateral’s opposite sides are equal, we know that it is a parallelogram .

The correct set of dimensions (that we will be using here) are high-lighted in bold, while the once suffixed with a ‘#’ can also be used. So, in triangle x we take PD as altitude and DQ as base.

Assume $Q$ is already strictly convex. Is there any characterization of $h$ such that the boundary $\partial Q$ admits nonvanishing curvature? Thank you! :) Edit: as Harald's comment below, the resulting domain $Q=Q(h)$ is always convex, since it is the intersection of a family of convex domains--half planes.  Thank you Harald! Let's start with arbitrary $2\pi$-periodic, positive function $h$, and obtain a convex domain $Q=Q(h)$. Then we can reconsider the support function $g=g(Q)=g(Q(h))$ of $Q$, which might be different from $h$. This happens if $Q$ does not touch the boundary of some half plane. So we may restrict our attention to the class of faithful support functions, those satisfy the condition $g(Q(h))=h$.",,"['geometry', 'convex-analysis', 'plane-curves', 'convex-geometry', 'support-function']"

Thus, there must be two points of the same color which are either distance $1$ apart or $\phi=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$ apart. This is because the length of the diagonal of a regular pentagon is the golden ratio $\phi$ . But I cannot get $\sqrt{3}$ as one of the two possible distances. I tried working with a regular hexagon but could not succeed there either. Source. I saw this on a problem set for a Putnam exam preparation (it is Problem 3 in that sheet). Bonus question(s). What is special about $\sqrt{3}$ ? In other words, if $\alpha > 0$ is any other real number with $\alpha\neq 1$ , can we show that there must exist two points of the same color that are either $1$ apart or $\alpha$ apart? If not, is there a characterization of such values of $\alpha$ ?

65,Perspective view of longitudinal great circles - ellipses inside a circle,Perspective view of longitudinal great circles - ellipses inside a circle,,"I'd like to visualize the longitudes on a sphere from close-up, with correct perspective. It seems this is the ""Blue Marble"" problem i.e. to show how earth looks from a realistic distance (say 0.5 to 4 earth radii), and not from infinity with visible poles. These are 6 ellipses fitted into the visible horizon. Note that the poles have both sunken below the horizon; the upper pole is marked by a small circle. It is not easy to fit the ellipses into the circle by hand, because the center is shifted to the right, and both height and width have to be adapted. I do have 5 points to nail it down: both poles, the chosen intersection with the x-axis, and the two tangent points with the circle. With only the y component of the center known (=0), I would start with this equation: $$\frac{(x - x_o)^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2}=1$$ with the three unknowns $x_0, a$ and $b$ . The poles give two points on the ellipse. Now I would add a chosen third point on the x-axis, for purple about (0.7, 0). This leaves me with a bundle of ellipses: some wider than tall running to the left; some very high poking through the horizon, some too short to touch the circle from the inside. I gather - and faintly recall from school - that I can find a single solution with a discriminant of zero. So can anybody tell me how to proceed from here? Can it be done with (simple, maybe messy) algebra, or is there a shortcut? Do I have to find that 4th and symmetric 5th point first and then determine the ellipse? Thank you Added after comment: Yes the uniform change in angle is important; now at least I can determine where I want the meridians (x-axis crossing would be a bit more practical), while by hand I had to leave them more or less where they fit.

79,Special reptiles - repeating shapes and fractals,Special reptiles - repeating shapes and fractals,,"Let me first explain what a reptile is. A reptile is a two-dimensional object, a shape, that can be dissected into smaller, equally sized copies of the same shape. To illustrate this, see here a couple of reptiles: A shape is called an $n$-reptile, or $n$-rep for short, if the shape can be dissected into $n$ smaller, equally sized copies. So above you see a $2$-rep (recognize the shape? Yup, it's A4 paper! Could be any of the A-series in fact) a $3$-rep (a Sierpinski triangle ) and a random $4$-rep. Now obviously, if a shape is an $n$-rep, it's also a $n^2$-rep; simply dissect it once in $n$ pieces, and dissect every piece you made again in $n$ pieces. One can repeat this pattern to see that in fact, if a shape is an $n$-rep, then it must be an $n^k$-rep for integer $k\geq 1$. These dissections in $n^k$ pieces aren't very interesting though, since they're all based on the base case with $n$ pieces. This got me thinking, and so here's my question: Does there exist an $n$-reptile that is simultaneously an $m$-reptile with $n$ and $m$ coprime?","Let me first explain what a reptile is.

96,Finding the diameter of a circle projected on a plane,Finding the diameter of a circle projected on a plane,,"I am an engineer working on a machine designed to measure the diameters of cylindrical bores. To provide a clear and engaging context for my question, I'll describe the physical scenario in detail. Ideal Senario: Imagine a round measuring tool, represented as a dark blue circle with diameter $d$ , with three probes labeled as $Pa$ , $Pb$ , and $Pc$ . These probes are evenly spaced at angles of $62$ degrees ( $\theta$ ) from each other. The measuring tool is inserted into a round bore, represented as the red circle, to measure its diameter ( $D$ ). The goal is to find $D$ in all senarios. In this ideal scenario, calculating the bore diameter is straightforward since the measuring tool parallel to the part bore and we have 3 points! $Pa=[Pa_x,Pa_y,Pa_z]=[-(9.322+25)Sin⁡(62^{\circ}), -(9.322+25)Cos⁡(62^{\circ}), 0]$ $Pb=[Pb_x,Pb_y,Pb_z]=[0, -(9.988+25), 0]$ $Pc=[Pc_x,Pc_y,Pc_z]=[(15.603+25)Sin⁡(62^{\circ}), -(15.603+25)Cos⁡(62^{\circ}), 0]$ If you're interested in the solution for this ideal case, it can be found below. $x_1 = -(a + r) Sin(\theta)=-(9.322+25)Sin⁡(62^{\circ})$ $y_1 = -(a + r) Cos(\theta)=-(9.322+25)Cos⁡(62^{\circ})$ $x_2 = 0$ $y_2 = -(b + r)=-(9.988+25)$ $x_3 = (c + r) Sin(\theta)=(15.603+25)Sin⁡(62^{\circ})$ $y_3 = -(c + r) Cos(\theta)=-(15.603+25)Cos⁡(62^{\circ})$ $A1 = x_1 (y_2 - y_3) - y_1 (x_2 - x_3) + x_2 y_3 - x_3 y_2$ $B1 = (x_1^2 + y_1^2) (y_3 - y_2) + (x_2^2 + y_2^2) (y_1 - y_3) + (x_3^2 + y_3^2) (y_2 - y_1)$ $C1 = (x_1^2 + y_1^2) (x_2 - x_3) + (x_2^2 + y_2^2) (x_3 - x_1) + (x_3^2 + y_3^2) (x_1 - x_2)$ $D1 = (x_1^2 + y_1^2) (x_3 y_2 - x_2 y_3) + (x_2^2 + y_2^2) (x_1 y_3 - x_3 y_1) + (x_3^2 + y_3^2) (x_2 y_1 - x_1 y_2)$ $Diameter = 2\sqrt{\frac{B1^2 + C1^2 - 4 A1 D1}{4 A1^2}}=80.0002$ This agrees with the CAD! Actual Senario: However, in practical situations, we encounter both lack of measurement accuracy and repeatibility. This is because the measuring tool is not perfectly aligned parallel to the bore. Instead, the bore is at some angle relative to the measuring tool, which we'll refer to as the ""runout angle"" ( $\alpha$ ). Consider the 3d Model of this below: From the perspective of the measuring tool, the measuring tool is now measuring an oval shape. In this case the ideal senario diameter calculation does not hold! See 2D drawing below: We therefore have the following points on the part bore: $Pa=[Pa_x,Pa_y,Pa_z]=[-(9.51+25)Sin⁡(62^{\circ}), -(9.51+25)Cos⁡(62^{\circ}), 0]$ $Pb=[Pb_x,Pb_y,Pb_z]=[0, -(8.71+25), 0]$ $Pc=[Pc_x,Pc_y,Pc_z]=[(15.273+25)Sin⁡(62^{\circ}), -(15.273+25)Cos⁡(62^{\circ}), 0]$ Adding 3 additional probes (which can determine α) Our goal is to determine the actual bore diameter. To achieve this we add three additional probes, labeled as $P1$ , $P2$ , and $P3$ , which are mounted perpendicular to the measuring tool. These probes measure the plane that the part bore is ""mounted"" to! This plane is perpendicular to axis of the bore! Using these probes we are able to determine the runout angle ( $\alpha$ ). Consider the 3D and 2D represntations of this below: Calculating the runout angle is straightforward because it involves three points. $P1 = [P1_x, P1_y, P1_z] = [-25,0,25]$ $P2 = [P2_x, P2_y, P2_z] = [0,-25,15]$ $P3 = [P3_x, P3_y, P3_z] = [25,0,13]$ If you're interested in the solution for finding the runout angle ( $\alpha$ ) from these 3 points, it's available below: We find two vectors on the plane by subtracting one point from another: $\overrightarrow{a}=P2-P1=[25,-25,-10]$ $\overrightarrow{b}=P3-P1=[50,0,-12]$ Now we compute the cross product of these two vectors. This is the vector normal to the part bore. $\overrightarrow{v}=\overrightarrow{a}×\overrightarrow{b}=[v_x,v_y,v_z]=[300,-200,1250]$ We can also define the vector normal to the measuring tool. This is the vector normal to the plane $z=0$ , which is simply $\overrightarrow{n}=[0,0,1]$ . With both vectors $\overrightarrow{n}$ and $\overrightarrow{v}$ established, we can now calculate the total angle $\alpha$ between them. First, let's calculate the magnitude of $\overrightarrow{v}$ : $M = \sqrt{v_x^2+ v_y^2+ v_z^2}=\sqrt{(300)^2+(-200)^2+(1250)^2}=1300.961$ Next we need to determine the dot product $d$ of the two vectors $\overrightarrow{n}$ and $\overrightarrow{v}$ . $d=v_x×0 + v_y×0+ v_z×1= v_z = 1250 $ Finally we can compute the total runout angle $\alpha$ $\alpha=Cos^{-1}(\frac{d}{M})=Cos^{-1}(\frac{1250}{1300.961})=16.09^{\circ}$ This agrees with the CAD! Now the question arises: Is it possible to obtain the true diameter of the bore from the  points $Pa,Pb,Pc,P1,P2,P3$ ?","I am an engineer working on a machine designed to measure the diameters of cylindrical bores. To provide a clear and engaging context for my question, I'll describe the physical scenario in detail. Ideal Senario: Imagine a round measuring tool, represented as a dark blue circle with diameter , with three probes labeled as , , and . These probes are evenly spaced at angles of degrees ( ) from each other. The measuring tool is inserted into a round bore, represented as the red circle, to measure its diameter ( ). The goal is to find in all senarios. In this ideal scenario, calculating the bore diameter is straightforward since the measuring tool parallel to the part bore and we have 3 points! If you're interested in the solution for this ideal case, it can be found below. This agrees with the CAD! Actual Senario: However, in practical situations, we encounter both lack of measurement accuracy and repeatibility. This is because the measuring tool is not perfectly aligned parallel to the bore. Instead, the bore is at some angle relative to the measuring tool, which we'll refer to as the ""runout angle"" ( ). Consider the 3d Model of this below: From the perspective of the measuring tool, the measuring tool is now measuring an oval shape. In this case the ideal senario diameter calculation does not hold! See 2D drawing below: We therefore have the following points on the part bore: Adding 3 additional probes (which can determine α) Our goal is to determine the actual bore diameter. To achieve this we add three additional probes, labeled as , , and , which are mounted perpendicular to the measuring tool. These probes measure the plane that the part bore is ""mounted"" to! This plane is perpendicular to axis of the bore! Using these probes we are able to determine the runout angle ( ). Consider the 3D and 2D represntations of this below: Calculating the runout angle is straightforward because it involves three points. If you're interested in the solution for finding the runout angle ( ) from these 3 points, it's available below: We find two vectors on the plane by subtracting one point from another: Now we compute the cross product of these two vectors. This is the vector normal to the part bore. We can also define the vector normal to the measuring tool. This is the vector normal to the plane , which is simply . With both vectors and established, we can now calculate the total angle between them. First, let's calculate the magnitude of : Next we need to determine the dot product of the two vectors and . Finally we can compute the total runout angle This agrees with the CAD! Now the question arises: Is it possible to obtain the true diameter of the bore from the  points ?","d Pa Pb Pc 62 \theta D D Pa=[Pa_x,Pa_y,Pa_z]=[-(9.322+25)Sin⁡(62^{\circ}), -(9.322+25)Cos⁡(62^{\circ}), 0] Pb=[Pb_x,Pb_y,Pb_z]=[0, -(9.988+25), 0] Pc=[Pc_x,Pc_y,Pc_z]=[(15.603+25)Sin⁡(62^{\circ}), -(15.603+25)Cos⁡(62^{\circ}), 0] x_1 = -(a + r) Sin(\theta)=-(9.322+25)Sin⁡(62^{\circ}) y_1 = -(a + r) Cos(\theta)=-(9.322+25)Cos⁡(62^{\circ}) x_2 = 0 y_2 = -(b + r)=-(9.988+25) x_3 = (c + r) Sin(\theta)=(15.603+25)Sin⁡(62^{\circ}) y_3 = -(c + r) Cos(\theta)=-(15.603+25)Cos⁡(62^{\circ}) A1 = x_1 (y_2 - y_3) - y_1 (x_2 - x_3) + x_2 y_3 - x_3 y_2 B1 = (x_1^2 + y_1^2) (y_3 - y_2) + (x_2^2 + y_2^2) (y_1 - y_3) + (x_3^2 + y_3^2) (y_2 - y_1) C1 = (x_1^2 + y_1^2) (x_2 - x_3) + (x_2^2 + y_2^2) (x_3 - x_1) + (x_3^2 + y_3^2) (x_1 - x_2) D1 = (x_1^2 + y_1^2) (x_3 y_2 - x_2 y_3) + (x_2^2 + y_2^2) (x_1 y_3 - x_3 y_1) + (x_3^2 + y_3^2) (x_2 y_1 - x_1 y_2) Diameter = 2\sqrt{\frac{B1^2 + C1^2 - 4 A1 D1}{4 A1^2}}=80.0002 \alpha Pa=[Pa_x,Pa_y,Pa_z]=[-(9.51+25)Sin⁡(62^{\circ}), -(9.51+25)Cos⁡(62^{\circ}), 0] Pb=[Pb_x,Pb_y,Pb_z]=[0, -(8.71+25), 0] Pc=[Pc_x,Pc_y,Pc_z]=[(15.273+25)Sin⁡(62^{\circ}), -(15.273+25)Cos⁡(62^{\circ}), 0] P1 P2 P3 \alpha P1 = [P1_x, P1_y, P1_z] = [-25,0,25] P2 = [P2_x, P2_y, P2_z] = [0,-25,15] P3 = [P3_x, P3_y, P3_z] = [25,0,13] \alpha \overrightarrow{a}=P2-P1=[25,-25,-10] \overrightarrow{b}=P3-P1=[50,0,-12] \overrightarrow{v}=\overrightarrow{a}×\overrightarrow{b}=[v_x,v_y,v_z]=[300,-200,1250] z=0 \overrightarrow{n}=[0,0,1] \overrightarrow{n} \overrightarrow{v} \alpha \overrightarrow{v} M = \sqrt{v_x^2+ v_y^2+ v_z^2}=\sqrt{(300)^2+(-200)^2+(1250)^2}=1300.961 d \overrightarrow{n} \overrightarrow{v} d=v_x×0 + v_y×0+ v_z×1= v_z = 1250  \alpha \alpha=Cos^{-1}(\frac{d}{M})=Cos^{-1}(\frac{1250}{1300.961})=16.09^{\circ} Pa,Pb,Pc,P1,P2,P3","['geometry', 'trigonometry', 'euclidean-geometry', 'circles', 'projective-geometry']"
97,How to prove that a point cannot lie within a triangle based on statements about triangles containing points.,How to prove that a point cannot lie within a triangle based on statements about triangles containing points.,,"I'm a total newb and bottom rung hobbyist mathematician, just fair warning. Say points a,b,c,d,e are in the plane (general position) and triangle abc contains point d, triangle ade contains point c. It seems intuitive that triangle bcd cannot contian point e, but I don't know how to prove it, without trying actual values for the coordinates. My first thought was to set up a system of inequalities, one for each statement of containment, similar to barrycentric coordinates (but using cross products), then somehow deduce a contradiction. The inequality list looks like this. I gather one would have to check a number of different sign conditions, and perhaps all possible orderings of x and y. I'm ok to assume a specific ordering, like $a_x < e_x < c_x < d_x < b_x$ and $a_y < b_y < d_y < c_y < e_y$ , if that helps.
