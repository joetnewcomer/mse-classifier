7,Show that no non-constant polynomial can generate only prime numbers,Show that no non-constant polynomial can generate only prime numbers,,"This problem is taken from ""Mathematics for Computer Science"" (Lehman, Leighton, Meyer, 2018). Problem For $n = 40$ , the value of the polynomial $p(n) := n^2 + n + 41$ is not prime, as noted in Section 1.1. But we could have predicted based on general principles that no non-constant polynomial can generate only prime numbers. In particular, let $q(n)$ be a polynomial with integer coefficients, and let $c:=q(0)$ be the constant term of $q$ . (a) Verify that $q(cm)$ is a multiple of $c$ for all $m \in \mathbb{Z}$ . (b) Show that if $q$ is nonconstant and $c > 1$ , then as $n$ ranges over the nonnegative integers $\mathbb{N}$ there are infinitely many $q(n) \in \mathbb{Z}$ that are not primes. Hint : You may assume the familiar fact that the magnitude of any nonconstant polynomial $q(n)$ grows unboundedly as $n$ grows. (c) Conclude that for every nonconstant polynomial $q$ there must be an $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $q(n)$ is not prime. Hint : Only one easy case remains. Solution attempt (a) The polynomial can be expressed as $q(n) = c + a_1n + a_2n^2 + \cdots + a_kn^k$ . So, $q(cm) = c + a_1cm + a_2c^2m^2 + ... + a_kc^km^k$ . Since all terms of $q(cm)$ are divisible by $c$ , $q(cm)$ is a multiple of $c$ for all $m \in \mathbb{Z}$ . (b) As $n$ ranges over the nonnegative integers, it will range over infinitely many values of the form $n=cm$ ( $m \in \mathbb{Z}$ ). As shown in (a), for each $n=cm$ , $q(cm)$ is a multiple of $c$ . Therefore, assuming that the magnitude of $q(n)$ grows unboundedly as $n$ grows, this means that $q(n)$ will take infinitely many non-prime values. (c) Item (b) covered the cases where $c > 1$ . For nonconstant $q$ , two cases remain: $c < -1$ and $-1 \leq c \leq 1$ . For $c < -1$ , a similar argument to (b) applies: as $n$ ranges over the negative integers, it will range over infinitely many values of the form $n=cm$ (where $m$ is a negative integer). For each of these values, $q(n)$ is a multiple of $c$ . Therefore, assuming that the magnitude of $q(n)$ grows unboundedly as $n$ grows, this means that $q(n)$ will take infinitely many non-prime values. For $c -1 \leq c \leq 1$ , $q(0) = c$ is an example of root that is not prime. Therefore, for every nonconstant polynomial $q$ , there must be an $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $q(n)$ is not prime.

(The proof is from pages 1-4.) In particular, I do not understand Case 2 of the inductive step. To give a little background info without following the link, I think the author is trying to show that the boundary of any planar graph can be 3-colored while its interior vertices can be 5-colored. He proves this statement is true by strong induction over the number of vertices. For Case 1 of the inductive step, he shows it is true for graphs with chords. For Case 2, he shows it is true if boundary nodes are connected to interior nodes. Here is the text of the confusing part of Case 2: This $G'$ has an outer boundary defined by the   following $B' = (B\setminus\{v_0\}) \cup \{v_1, v_2, \dots, v_t\}$. We know by our second assumption that $|C(v_0)| \geq 3$,   and that there must exist two colors $\gamma$ and $\delta$ in $C(v_0)$   that are different from $\alpha$. Now we want to   remove the colors $\gamma$ and $\delta$ from the color sets for   each of the vertices $v_1, \dots, v_t$ since we know that $v_0$   will have one of those two colors. Thus, we can   think that if $C(v_i)$ was the original color sets for   the vertices $v_1, \dots, v_t$, their new color sets will be   of the form $C(v_i) \setminus \{\gamma, \delta\}$. The remaining vertices in $G'$   that did not share a common edge with $v_0$ may   maintain their original color sets in $G'$. Now $G'$   satisfies all three of our assumptions, and is   therefore 5-list colorable by induction. Then we can return to our graph $G$ and choose $v_0$ to be   color $\gamma$ or $\delta$, a color different from $w$, and show that $G$ must also be 5-list colorable. Why are vertices in $G$ that did not share an edge with $v_0$ allowed to keep their color? We haven't proven the hypothesis for $G$, so what if they are colored with a color that isn't $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\delta$, or $\gamma$? Then adding $v_0$ back would mean $G$ has 4 colors on its boundary. If $w$ is colored $\gamma$ or $\delta$, and $v_0$ is added back, then wouldn't $w$, $v_0$, $x$, and $y$ be 4 different colors? What exactly is the color set of a vertex? Why can we simply say $v_1, \dots, v_t$ are different colors than $v_0$? Don't we have to prove that's possible?
