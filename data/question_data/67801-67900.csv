0,Teams in tournament problem,Teams in tournament problem,,"I have a practical math problem that I can't solve by myself. The problem is probably already solved by other people but I can't think of any Google  search words. If somebody knows a solution or is willing to try and solve it that would be awesome. I need a algorithm to plan some kind of tournament. I wrote an algorithm in Mathematica  that tries randomly to find the best option but it would take thousands of years to solve the  problem that way. This is the problem: There are a total of p people, they are distributed over teams. Ever round g different games are played, t teams play game A, t teams play game B etc. for  all g games. (So the total number of teams is t*g.) For instance: g = 5, t=3 (so there a 15 teams) ....................Round 1......................Round 2............. Round 3 etc. etc. Game A:.....1 vs 2 vs 3..............4 vs 8 vs 15...............etc. Game B:.....4 vs 5 vs 6.................1 vs 7 vs 12................etc. Game C:.....7 vs 8 vs 9.................2 vs 10 vs 13..............etc. Game D:....10 vs 11 vs 12...........3 vs 6 vs 14.................etc. Game E:.....13 vs 14 vs 15...........5 vs 9 vs 11................etc. Rule 1: Every team has to play every game at least once, but no more than strictly necessary  to make all rules work. Rule 2: Every team has to play against every other team ,so team 1 has to play team 2,3,4...15  (team 2 has to play team all other teams etc. etc.). If team 1 already played team 12, they can  only play each other again if it's strictly necessary to make the rules work. In the example  above there was a match ""1 vs 7 vs 12"" so later on match ""1 vs 12 vs 9"" may only happen is  there is no other option. Rule 3: If a team has to play a game more than once, it's better if there is a pause between  those games (so not in successive rounds). Rule 4: If a team has to play a other team more than once, it's better if there is a pause  between those games (so not in successive rounds). Rule 5: If the people can't be distributed equally over the teams (for instance p=147 and  there are 15 teams, three teams will be smaller), smaller teams shouldn't play each other if  possible. So if team 13, 14 and 15 are smaller match ""13 vs 14 vs 15"" should be avoided if  possible. (While match ""13 vs 14 vs ..."" can't be avoided since team 13 has to play team 14 at  least once.) The rules are ordered according to importance, rule 1 is the most important. The answer to this problem may be given in any form: group theory, graphs, algebra ect. Buy I prefer some kind of pseudocode so I can easily make a Mathematica workbook or C++  application. Of course every little tip is very welcome, it doesn't have to be a complete  solution!

2,Shortest way to convert two formulas using associative and commutative steps,Shortest way to convert two formulas using associative and commutative steps,,"You have two formulas in which you add $n$ variables. The variables in the two formulas are the same, but they may be in a different order and the parenthesis may be different. As an example I will use the formulas $a + (((c + e) + d) + b)$ and $(d + e) + ((a + b) + c)$. Because additions is commutative ($a + b = b + a$) and associative ($(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$), you can prove that these two formulas are the same. In the formulas of the example, this could be done in this way: a + (((c + e) + d) + b) commutative a + (b + ((c + e) + d)) associative (a + b) + ((c + e) + d) associative ((a + b) + (c + e)) + d associative (((a + b) + c) + e) + d commutative d + (((a + b) + c) + e) associative (d + ((a + b) + c)) + e commutative (((a + b) + c) + d) + e associative ((a + b) + c) + (d + e) commutative (d + e) + ((a + b) + c) This proof contains of 9 steps. But it probably can be done in less steps. For each combination of two formulas of $n$ variables I want such a proof that has a minimal number of steps. Only the commutative and associative steps may be applied, not induction or anything. What algorithm can I use?

I know that a proof with a minimal number of steps is not always unique. It may be helpful to display the formulas as a graph, for example, for $n = 3$: Then for each two vertices in the graph you have to find a shortest path.

3,How many different Forsyth-Edwards Notation ranks are possible?,How many different Forsyth-Edwards Notation ranks are possible?,,"(This is a combinatorics question, and therefore more appropriate here than at the Chess Stack Exchange.) Background: in chess, board positions are recorded using a system called Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN for short). The rows (called ""ranks"" in chess) are written from left to right, starting at the top of the board and continuing to the bottom. The pieces are listed with letters: K for king, Q for queen, R for rook, B for bishop, N for knight, and P for pawn. Uppercase letters are used for white pieces and lowercase for the black pieces. Empty spaces are denoted by numbers; ranks are separated by slashes. See the Wikipedia article for a full explanation and examples. My question is, how many ranks are possible? No positions illegal due to rules of pawn promotion or castling may occur given only one rank, so the sole restrictions from chess rules are: There cannot be more than two kings on the same rank, and if that is the case they must be opposite colours. The kings cannot be next to each other (kK and Kk are invalid) A king cannot have a queen or rook on both sides of it surrounded by empty space Both kings cannot be in check at the same time. This translates into: if both kings are on the same rank, it is invalid to have only empty space between each king and an opposing Qq or Rr. I cannot decide whether it is relevant that empty spaces are condensed into a single number (four consecutive empty spaces are written as 4 rather than 1111). The initial count of the possible ranks without kings is very high: with $11$ square types (the six piece types, minus the king, times two colours, plus an empty square), and eight available squares, the total number is $11^8 = 214358881$. Continuing, we can explore the case where there is one king. There are $8$ squares to place it and $2$ colours, so there are $16$ initial ways to place the king. There are $7$ remaining squares and $11$ remaining square types, so the total number of piece arrangements is $16 \times 11^7 = 311794736$. But many of these are illegal, because they have the king in check from two pieces at once. We must also consider that if there is a non-horizontal piece between a king and checking piece, then the position will become legal. If the checking pieces are one square away from each other (only the king between them), then there are $11^5 = 161051$ ways to populate the rest of the rank. Multiply this by $6$ available squares for the king to get $966306$. If the checking pieces are two squares apart, the three pieces have $10$ different placements and the rest of the rank can be populated in $11^4 = 14641$ ways (total $146410$). If they are three squares apart, there are $12$ arrangements and $11^3$ ways to populate the rest of the rank ($15972$). Continuing on, four squares apart yield $1452$ illegal arrangements, five squares yield $110$, and six yield $6$. The total number of illegal arrangements is thus $966306 + 146410 + 15972 + 1452 + 110 + 6 = 1130256$. The pieces can also be $2$ different colours, and there are $2$ possible checking pieces, so the total number of illegal ranks with one king is $1130256 \times 2 \times 2 = 4521024$. The number of legal ranks is $311794736 - 4521024 = 307273712$.","(This is a combinatorics question, and therefore more appropriate here than at the Chess Stack Exchange.)

4,Minimizing set intersection/block design,Minimizing set intersection/block design,,"I asked this question on the CS theory stack exchange, but didn't get an answer. Was wondering whether anyone here might have some insight. Thanks in advance for any help. Given 3 parameters $s, r$ and $t$, where $r \leq t$, I want to construct $t$ sets such that each integer $\{1, \ldots, s\}$ appears in exactly $r$ of these sets. The question is: Is it possible to construct $t$ sets such that the size of the maximum pairwise intersection between any two $t_i, t_j$ is $\leq k$? What is the complexity of this decision problem? Is minimizing the maximum pairwise intersection between the sets $\mathsf{NP}$-hard? A comment on the CS Theory stackexchange pointed out that this probably is not NP-complete, since verifying the intersection of all of the sets is quadratic in t and therefore exponential in the size of the input. There is a lower bound on the max pairwise intersection given by ceiling(number of identical value pairs / number of set pairs), $\lceil (s \cdot {r \choose 2}) / {t \choose 2} \rceil$. This is a natural value for $k$ above, making the question whether there exists an assignment that achieves this bound. The problem seems related to, but slightly different from, the block design problem . In the block design problem, there is a parameter $\lambda$ that dictates in how many of the $t$ sets each pair of integers in $\{1, \ldots, s\}$ must appear, so if $\lambda$ is 1, the maximum pairwise intersection between sets is 1 (since each pair of values appears in at most 1 set together). I've seen claims that deciding the existence of a block design is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete, but no actual proof - would also appreciate any link to such a proof.","I asked this question on the CS theory stack exchange, but didn't get an answer.

I would greatly value some help on this, as I have an exam coming up soon and this is the last section of my course I feel I am failing to understand. Question 1. Show that for every $k \geq -1$ there is some constant $c_k$ such that $C(n,n+k) \sim c_k n^{n + (3k-1)/2}$. As I said, I've tried to come up with something, but I've really not made any progress; I can't say $(3k-1)/2$ is an expression I've come across before in graph-counting, so I can't see any obvious route to take. So, knowing this we can say for example that $C(n,n-1) = n^{n-2}$ by Cayley's formula; every connected graph on $n$ vertices with $n-1$ edges must be a tree, and therefore $c_{-1} = 1$. Similarly it can be shown that $c_0 = \sqrt{\pi / 8}$; e.g. by considering graphs with single cycles. Thus my next question may be somewhat obvious: Question 2. Show that $c_1$ = 5/24; i.e. $C(n,n+1) \sim (5/24)n^{n+1}$. (The question also says: ""To save you the trouble of computing the central absolute moments of the standard normal distribution, use that $\int_0^\infty x^3 e^{-x^2/2}dx = 2$."" This probably gives a big hint about how to solve the problem, though if you have an alternative method that would be equally welcome.) Once again, I've gotten nowhere with this one. I think maybe you have to consider it as a case-by-case basis: start with a tree with $n-1$ edges and then consider all the ways you could possibly add 2 edges and the different graph structures that could result. However, I've had no success. Anyway, these questions have me stumped and as I said above, any proof you could provide (or if necessary a source for a proof) would be greatly valued - preferably as soon as you are able please, sadly exams wait for no (wo/)man! As a matter of interest, I'd also like to know (though less important than the previous 2 questions): Question 3. Are any other values of $c_i$ known?

The construction is essentially a map $\phi$ from the set of rooted trees to the positive reals arising from some operations on the positive reals, $+$ and a collection of operations, one for each $n$, $\oplus_n$, taking $n$ arguments. Every one of these operations is symmetric and $+$ distributes over $\oplus_n$ for each $n$. There is a notion of composition of trees, which is just root-to-leaf adjoining of graphs. We require that whenever a tree, $T$, can be written as a composition of an $n$-corolla (ie. a rooted tree with $n+1$ vertices and $n$ leaves) and $n$ trees $A_1,..,A_n$, then $\phi(T)=\phi(n$-corolla$)+\oplus_n(\phi(A_1),...,\phi(A_n))$.

For me, it is an internal algebra in an algebra where the trees correspond simultaneously to search algorithms, guessing strategies, ways of building up information measures, and ways of associating variables. The map is actually defined more generally for such trees, since these trees act via $\oplus_n$ on the positive reals as prescribed by the $A_\infty$-operad.

47,Showing that the Fibonacci's $\binom{n}{k}_F$ is an integer by following the Benjamin-Plot proof,Showing that the Fibonacci's  is an integer by following the Benjamin-Plot proof,\binom{n}{k}_F,"In this paper of A. T. Benjamin and S. S. Plot https://www.fq.math.ca/Papers1/46_47-1/Benjamin_11-08.pdf there's the proof that the following coefficient is an integer: $$\binom{n}{k}_F = \frac{F_nF_{n-1}\dots F_{n-k+1}}{F_kF_{k-1}\dots F_1}$$ where $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$ , for $n \ge 2$ , and $F_0=0$ , $F_1=1$ . It is clear that if $f_n$ is the $n$ -th Fibonacci's number, then $f_n = F_{n+1}$ . A well known combinatorial interpretation of these numbers is that $F_n = f_{n-1}$ counts the number of tilings of a $(n-1) \times 1$ board, with squares $1 \times 1$ and dominoes $2 \times 1$ . Hence $F_nF_{n-1}\dots F_{n-k+1}$ enumerates the number of simultaneous tilings, in squares and dominoes, of $(n-1) \times 1$ , $(n-2)\times 1$ , $\dots$ , $(n-k)\times 1$ boards. To show that $\binom{n}{k}_F$ is an integer, they ""cut away"" a disjointed covering in squares and dominoes of $(k-1) \times 1$ , $(k-2)\times 1$ , $\dots$ , $1 \times 1$ boards (counted by $F_kF_{k-1}\dots F_1$ ) from those described above representing the numerator. The procedure is not that hard : first of all we are looking for a $(k-1)\times 1$ covering, starting by the $(n-1)\times 1$ board. If a domino doesn't cover the cells $k-1$ and $k$ , we can break the board at $k-1$ finding what we wanted. It can happen in $f_{k-1}f_{n-k} = F_kF_{n-k+1}$ ways, by considering the number of coverings of the two independent boards we got breaking the $(n-1)\times 1$ at $k-1$ . Naming $T_i$ a tailing of $(n-i)\times 1$ . If a domino is laid on the $k-1$ and $k$ cells, that can happen in $f_{k-2}f_{n-k-1} = F_{k-1}F_{n-k}$ ways, by throwing away that domino and taking into account the new two boards $(k-2)\times 1$ and $(n-k-1)\times 1$ disjointed, then we eliminate the first $k$ cells obtaining a $(n-k-1) \times 1$ tiling, that is $T_{k+1}$ . We follow this procedure on the next $(n-2)\times 1$ , $(n-3)\times 1$ , $\dots$ , since we find a tiling $T_{x_1}$ that is breakable at $k-1$ , which exists as $T_{n-k+1}$ has length $k-1$ . So $1 \le x_1 < n$ . Iterating this method (looking for $(k-2)\times 1$ by starting from $T_{x_1+1}$ , etc.) we find a disjointed covering $T_1, \dots, T_k$ of $(k-1)\times 1, \dots, 1\times1$ . Then they write: ""Following this procedure, we have, for $1 \le x_1 < x_2 < ··· < x_{k-1} \le n$ , the number of tilings $T_1, T_2, \dots , T_k$ that lead to finding a tiling of length $k − i$ at the beginning of tiling $T_{x_i}$ is $f_{k-2}^{x_1-1}f_{k-1}f_{n-x_1 - (k-1)}f_{k-3}^{x_2-x_1-1}f_{k-2}f_{n-x_2 - (k-2)}\dots f_{0}^{x_{k-1}-x_{k-2}-1}f_{1}f_{n-x_{k-1} - 1}$ "" I haven't fully understood this result yet. The process to obtain $(k-1)\times1$ sees the contribute of $f_{k-2}$ any time we can't break the board at $k-1$ , which happens for $x_1-1$ times, so we have $f_{k-2}^{x_1-1}$ . I assume that $f_{k-1}$ derives from the case in which we can break it and stop the iteration for $(k-1)\times 1$ (?), then $f_{n-x_1 - (k-1)}$ how does it come up? Any explanation would be appreciated, thank you. EDIT Maybe I figured it out and it was easier that I thought: when the process stops at $x_1$ we are considering a $n-x_1$ row, so $f_{k-1}f_{n-x_1 - (k-1)}$ is the number of independent tilings of the that board broken at $k-1$ !","In this paper of A.
