If $A$ is a ring with characteristic $p$ then there is a Frobenius morphism $F:A\to A$ which sends $a$ to $F(a)=a^p$; this morphism is injective iif there are no nilpotent elements and in general is not surjective. From now on let $K$ be a field of characteristic $p$, and $X$ a $K$-scheme.

Since we are looking for the q-th roots of elements of prime ideals, $F^{abs}$ is the identity on the points of $X$, while sends a section in its q-th power as pointed in this answer. Unless $K=\mathbb F_p$, the absolute Frobenius is not a morphism of $K$-schemes , but it makes the following diagram commute \begin{array}{rcl} X&\overset{F^{abs}}{\longrightarrow}&X\\ \downarrow&&\downarrow&\\ Y&\overset{F^{abs}}{\longrightarrow}&Y \end{array} for any morphism $X\to Y$. This will be useful to define the relative version of this morphism. Frobenius Twist The Frobenius twist of $X$ is defined as the fibered product $X^{(p)}:= X\times_{\operatorname{Spec}(K)}\operatorname{Spec}(K)$, where $\operatorname{Spec}(K)$ is regarded as a $K$-scheme whith the absolute Frobenius as structure morphism. +++Here come the first questions: if $K=\mathbb F_p$ then $X^{(p)}\cong X$ since we are extending via the identity, but in general I cannot understand its structure. Wiki gives the explicit answer in the affine case (there is called extension by scalars ), but it's not clear to me how it works and furthermore I don't understand it geometrically: which are the points of $X^{(p)}$? Which are his $K$-points? Are the $\mathbb F_p$-points of $X$ and $X^{(p)}$ the same? In particular, what can we say if the field K is perfect (so F is an automorphism)? I expect them to be isomorphic, even though not naturally. I'm not very familiar with tensor product of $K$-algebras, but trying to think in the affine case $X\cong\operatorname{Spec}(A)$, it seems to me that $X^{(p)}$ should correspond to the tensor product algebra $A\otimes K$, where $v\otimes\lambda$ is identified to $\lambda^pv\otimes 1$, and where $K$ acts as $\alpha.v\otimes\lambda=\alpha v\otimes\lambda=v\otimes\alpha^p\lambda$ Relative Frobenius For what we've said, we find that there is a universal morphism $F^{rel}:X\to X^{(p)}$ which is called relative Frobenius .

Show that $\overline{D(f)}$ is the union of the irreducible components meeting $D(f)$, using (i). My solution goes as follows: (i) Since $A$ is integral, an embedded point is given by a non-unit $f$ such that $\operatorname{Supp}f \not \supset V(f)$. This is because Supp $f\supset D(f)$, so that if it also contained $V(f)$, it would contain everything. On the other hand, if $\operatorname{Supp} f\not \supset V(f)$, then Supp $f$ can't be an irreducible component of Spec $A$ and must be the closure of a union of embedded points.

By (i) this cannot correspond to a proper irreducible subset of $\operatorname{Spec} A_{g_i}$, so (ii) follows. The claim can be proven by induction, and I show the case where $A$ has three minimal primes $\mathfrak p, \mathfrak q, \xi$.

By a change of coordinate over $\mathbb{R}$, we can assume that the lattice is $\mathbb{Z}^4$. The question is equivalent to constructing a $4\times 4$ real matrix $J$ such that $J^2=-\mathrm{Id}$ and $J$ has no nontrivial invariant subspaces that are spanned by vectors with rational coefficients.

To achieve this, we note that the field generated by the coordinates of $xv_1+yv_2$ has at most transcendental degree 2 over $\mathbb{Q}$, so if we can choose $J$ with many independent transcental entries such that $Jv$ have high transcendental degree over $\mathbb{Q}$ for all  $v\in \mathbb{Q}$, then the problem is solved.

My question is Why is the sheaf of rings $\mathcal{O}$ defined above a sheaf of rings? While it seems clear that $\mathcal{O}$ is a presheaf, I fail to see why it satisfies the extra axioms that make it a sheaf. Hartshorne says ""it is clear from the local nature of the definition that $\mathcal{O}$ is a sheaf"", but while trying to prove it formally, I couldn't show that it is actually a sheaf. Also, I've just been fiddling around with the definitions for the moment trying to gain some insight about why this ""provides a systematic way of keeping track of local algebraic data on $\mathrm{Spec}\ A$"", but for now, it's just as mysterious as it was at the beginning. So if anyone could provide me some insight about why this is what we want to be our definition of structure sheaf, I'd be very grateful for that.

86,How to understand the projective compactification of a vector bundle?,How to understand the projective compactification of a vector bundle?,,"The following question confused me a bit: Given a rank $n$ vector bundle or locally free sheaf $\mathcal{E}$ on $X$, each fiber of this vector bundle is a vector space of dimension $n$. Therefore, we can compactify it into a projective space $\mathbb{P}^n$. And if we do this compatibly for every fiber we get a $\mathbb{P}^n$-projective bundle. Now my question is whether this projective bundle is $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E}\oplus\mathcal{O}_X)$ or $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E}^{\vee}\oplus\mathcal{O}_X)$. Here by $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{F})$ for some locally free sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ I mean the projective bundle of hyperplanes (instead of the projective bundle of lines). At first I thought the answer should be $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E}\oplus\mathcal{O}_X)$. Then something seems to be wrong. If I consider the zero section of the vector bundle $ \mathcal{E}$, it can also be viewed as a section of the projective bundle $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E}\oplus\mathcal{O}_X)$. Then it should corresponds to the surjection $\mathcal{E}\oplus\mathcal{O}_X \rightarrow \mathcal{O}_X\rightarrow 0$ by sending $\mathcal{E}$ to $0$ because what else it can be. However if I consider a concrete example, namely the blowing up of $\mathbb{P}^2$ at a point, this is not the case. The blow-up can be viewed as a $\mathbb{P}^1$-projective bundle (i.e. ruled surface) over $\mathbb{P}^1$. Let $X=\mathbb{P}^1$. Then the resulting space of the blow-up is $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{O}_X(1)\oplus\mathcal{O}_X)$. Therefore, we can also see it as the projective compactification of the line bundle $\mathcal{O}_X(1)$. But then the surjection $$ \mathcal{O}_X(1)\oplus\mathcal{O}_X\rightarrow \mathcal{O}_X\rightarrow 0 $$ actually determines the section at infinity, which is the exceptional divisor of the blow-up. Instead, for any section $s\in H^0(X,\mathcal{O}_X(1))$, there is a natural map $$ \mathcal{O}_X\rightarrow \mathcal{O}_X(1) $$ given by multiplication of $s$. Therefore, when considered as a section of $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{O}_X(1)\oplus\mathcal{O}_X)$, $s$ is determined by the induced surjection $$ \mathcal{O}_X(1)\oplus\mathcal{O}_X\rightarrow \mathcal{O}_X(1)\rightarrow 0. $$ This example makes me believe that the projective compactification of $\mathcal{E}$ is actually $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E}^{\vee}\oplus\mathcal{O}_X)$. Now everything seems to be consistent. Let $s\in H^0(X,\mathcal{E})$. Then we have a map $$ \mathcal{O}_X\rightarrow\mathcal{E}  $$ given by multiplication of $s$. Take the dual we have a map $$ \mathcal{E}^{\vee}\rightarrow \mathcal{O}_X. $$ And the induced surjection $$ \mathcal{E}^{\vee}\oplus\mathcal{O}_X\rightarrow \mathcal{O}_X \rightarrow 0 $$ defines the section $s$. It seems a little bit weird that the projective compactification of $\mathcal{E}$ might be $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E}^{\vee}\oplus\mathcal{O}_X)$ instead of $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E}\oplus\mathcal{O}_X)$. Is there any explanation for this (if I am not completely talking about nonsense)? My guess is that it should have something to do with the fact I am considering projective bundle of hyperplanes.
