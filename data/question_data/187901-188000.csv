2,Formal Notation for Finding Inverses of Functions,Formal Notation for Finding Inverses of Functions,,"Generally in most introductory university courses, finding the inverses of functions, is done in what seems to be to be a very haphazard way. Given any scalar function $f : \mathbb{R^n} \to \mathbb{R}$, what most people would do is say (and I put this here in as general a form as I can) : $$y = f(x)$$ and then do a swap of variables $$x = f^{-1}(y)$$ But the only reason this 'swap' is done is because the function $f$ is mapping a set $A$ (it's domain) to another set $B$ (it's codomain). This can be represented as $$f : A \to B$$ and the inverse is simply $$f^{-1} : B \to A$$ But the swap of the of the variables only implicitly shows this, transformation of the function $f$ to $f^{-1}$, it does not formally show the reversal of the mapping of the sets (the domain and codomain). I will give an example below to further illustrate my point : Example : Find $f^{-1}(x)\ \  \text{of} \ \  f(x)=e^x$ This is what most professors, typically would do to find the inverse : $$y = f(x)$$ $$\implies y = e^x$$ $$\implies x = e^y$$ $$\implies ln(x) = ln(e^y)$$ $$\implies y = ln(x)$$ $$\implies f^{-1}(x) = ln(x)$$ As you can see in the example above, there is virtually no structure to the way the inverse function $f^{-1}$ has been computed, and leaves a lot to be desired in terms of formalism. This way of computing inverse functions, is what is commonly used by almost everyone, but I don't find it rigorous. Sure it does find the inverse function, but the process of finding it is very informal and unsatisfactory. My question is, what is the most formal notation/process for finding the inverses of functions?

8,"Are polylogarithms the simplest functions that decay exponentially in one limit, and grow polynomially in another limit?","Are polylogarithms the simplest functions that decay exponentially in one limit, and grow polynomially in another limit?",,"I have a function $f(x)$ which is defined as the solution to a certain differential equation. The boundary conditions are that in the $x\rightarrow \infty$ limit, it should be asymptotically equivalent to $\exp(-x)$, i.e.  $$\lim_{x\rightarrow \infty} \frac{f(x)}{\exp(-x)}=c_{\infty}$$ where $c_{\infty}$ is some finite constant (not $\infty$, not 0). In the $x\rightarrow -\infty$ limit, it should be asymptotically equivalent to a polynomial, say $x^n$: $$\lim_{x\rightarrow -\infty} \frac{f(x)}{x^n}=c_{-\infty}$$ where $c_{-\infty}$ is some finite constant (not $\infty$, not 0). I hoped to approximate this function with elementary functions, or at least with fairly well-known special functions. So, I thought, which functions behave exponential-like in one limit but polynomial-like in the other? The sigmoid function $\frac{1}{1+\exp(-x)}$ is an example, it approaches $\exp(x)$ in one limit and $1$ in the other limit. By repeated integration of the sigmoid function, we can find a function that behaves like $\exp(x)$ in one limit, and like $x^n$ in the other. This works fine, but, alas, repeatedly integrating $\frac{1}{1+\exp(-x)}$ gives rise to Polylogarithms , which are still somewhat more complicated than I would have hoped. So: are there functions that can be expressed in terms of elementary functions, that behave like $\exp(-x)$ for very large positive $x$ and like $x^n$ for very large negative $x$? Edit: Repeated integration of any sigmoid-like function (like tanh, arctan or the error function) would work, though I would be surprised if elementary sigmoid-like functions existed whose integrals are simpler than those of $\frac{1}{1+\exp(-x)}$. Multiplying a sigmoid with a polynomial does not work - doing that makes at least one of the limits diverge.","I have a function $f(x)$ which is defined as the solution to a certain differential equation.
