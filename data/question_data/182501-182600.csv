The smaller circle has a radius of 2 (pink line), the mid of 4, and the largest of 5. From the end of the pink line, 2 perpendicular lines extend out. One (blue line) is bound by the quarter circle with radii 4. The other (red line) is bound by quarter circle of radii 5. As the pink line sweeps from 0 to 90 degrees, the blue line goes from its shortest length (2) to its longest length (3.46410161514) and the red line goes from its longest length (4.58257569496) to its shortest (3). My question is at what point in the pink lines sweep from 0 to 90 degrees does the length of the blue line and the length of the red line equal each other?

My math knowledge is at a pre-calc level. I have good trig familiarity and I do a lot of recreational math. My current intuition is to ascertain two functions that give a curve that represents the increase and decrease of the red and blue lines based on a degree value between 0 and 90.

Or in other words, is there a form for the function $L$ that touches the left endpoint of each line segment in the graph of $y_1 = T$ ? More formally, Given $y_2 = h$ for some integer $h$ , we have that $y_1$ and $y_2$ intersect in a line segment, say at $y=h$ from $x=x_{h^-}$ to $x=x_{h^+}$ . The left envelope of $y_1 = T$ would be the function $L$ such that for each integer $h$ , we have $L(x_{h^-}) = h$ or in other words for each integer $h$ , we have $L(x) = h$ iff $x = x_{h^-}$ .

It seems reasonable to expect a one-to-one mapping that carries one point $A$ into one point of $B$, in the direction indicated by the arrow.
