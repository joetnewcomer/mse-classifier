34,Constructing groups of order 16 from knowledge of their subgroups,Constructing groups of order 16 from knowledge of their subgroups,,"So I am rather curious about known techniques for constructing groups from knowledge of their subgroups. For instance, if I told you that a particular order 16 group had 3 order 8 subgroups, all isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_4$, it is possible to immediate conclude that the group is $2$-generated because it is an order 16 group with 3 order 8 subgroups. Moreover, it turns out that there are exactly two possibilities, but I only know this because I have analyzed all 14 groups of order 16. The possibilities are the abelian group $\mathbb{Z}_4\times\mathbb{Z}_4$ and a non-abelian semidirect product, $\mathbb{Z}_4\rtimes_\varphi\mathbb{Z}_4$, where $\varphi$ is surjective (onto $\operatorname{Aut}(\mathbb{Z}_4)\simeq\mathbb{Z}_2$). My admittedly somewhat general question is this: what methods would sufficient to construct all 14 groups of order 16 from just knowledge of the groups of order 1, 2, 4, and 8? I know they can all be represented as semi-direct products, but the same group can often be represented in quite a few different ways as semidirect products, which makes determining which groups are which (up to isomorphism) tedious. From analyzing the 14 different groups, most of them are readily distinguishable from each other via much more readily noticed properties (especially from a constructive perspective). For instance, it's easy to distinguish the two possibilities mentioned previously by looking at whether or not elements commute (curiously, they have identical subgroup lattices, sans that the entire group is not isomorphic). Likewise, distinguishing the modular group $M_{16}$ from the previous two is trivial if you have access to their subgroup lattices (the one for $M_{16}$ is clearly different from the other two, moreover, it has a cyclic subgroup of order 8, which the other two do not).

We call $G_p$ the $p$-primary component of $G$. I now want to show that $G_p$ is a subgroup of $G$. We have that $G_p ≠ \emptyset$, because $ord(e_G) = p^0 = 1$. I also already know that for any $g \in G_p$, $g^{-1} \in G_p$ (because the inverse has the same order for each element of the group, which I have already shown). The only thing I'm still struggling with is showing that for $g, h \in G_p$, $g h \in G_p$. I can see that if $ord(g) = p^k, ord(h) = p^l$, then $ord(g h) ≤ p^{k + l}$. However, I've been sitting here for several minutes and just couldn't figure out why $ord(gh)$ is of the shape $p^m$ for any $m \in \mathbb{N}_0$ itself. (For all I know, it could be that $ord(g h) = q^m$ for some $q \mid |G|, q ≠ p$, since $|G|$ can have more than one prime factor.)

I read the start of Serre's 1978 lectures Groupes Finis as a motivation, then moved on to Bourbaki's Algebra . Bourbaki's encyclopedia was not hard to follow up to chapter 6, where extensions began popping up. The characterization of a extension was comprehensible, along with his demonstration that the direct product and the external direct product were extensions and their characterizations. But when he moved on to the ( omissed term internal) semidirect product, I felt unsure on my understanding of the subject. Here's what I've got: Bourbaki's definition, external semidirect product : If $G$ and $F$ are two groups and there exists a homomorphism $\pi$ of $G$ into $\text{Aut}(F)$ - (the automorphism group of F, which in my understanding clearly defines a action of $G$ on $F$, through the map $\phi :G\times F \rightarrow F$ where $\phi(g, f) \mapsto \pi(g)(f)$) - then the set $F \times G$ with the composition: $$((f, g), (f',g')) \mapsto (f\pi(g)(f'), gg')$$ is a extension of G by F (written $F \times_\pi G$). With that proposition, we can describe all external semidirect product extensions of two groups $F$ and $G$ by looking at the possible homomorphisms of the automorphism group. Now to the real question. Bourbaki's definition, semidirect product : $G$ is a semidirect product of the subgroups $H$ and $K$ if $H$ is a normal subgroup, if $K\cap H = \{e\}$ and $H.K = G$. First off, from my understanding the statement $H.K = G$ is referring to the property of complement subgroups, i.e., every element $g$ of $G$ can be uniquely written as $hk$ for some $h \in H$ and $k \in K$. That means $K$ has one and only one representative of each orbit of the equivalence relation defined by $H$, and that means $K$ is isomorphic to $G/H$. Now, Bourbaki proceeds: ""Let $\pi$ be the operation of $K$ on $H$ by inner automorphisms of $G$. The mapping $(h, k) \mapsto hk$ is a isomorphism of $H \times_\pi K$ onto $G$"". I'm not sure I actually understand that last $\pi$ operation. If it defines a external semidirect product, it must be a homomorphism from $K$ to the automorphism group of $H$, so it must define a action of $K$ on $H$. When he mentions inner automorphisms of $G$, because $H$ is normal every inner automorphism of $G$ is a automorphism of $H$, and I guess the converse is also valid, so why couldn't $\pi$ be defined in terms of the group of automorphisms of $H$? Would it make it different? Does the set of inner automorphisms of $G$ and automorphisms of $H$ differ?","This recess I'm off to learn about group extensions and the cohomological methods to characterize those extensions, but I'm a bit stuck on wraping my head around all the new concepts (I just finished a beginners course covering material on elementary number theory, algebraic structures of the integers, some basic abstract algebra - concerning only finite and abelian groups -, with hints on analytic number theory and deeper abstract algebra).

With that proposition, we can describe all external semidirect product extensions of two groups $F$ and $G$ by looking at the possible homomorphisms of the automorphism group. Now to the real question. Bourbaki's definition, semidirect product : $G$ is a semidirect product of the subgroups $H$ and $K$ if $H$ is a normal subgroup, if $K\cap H = \{e\}$ and $H.K = G$. First off, from my understanding the statement $H.K = G$ is referring to the property of complement subgroups, i.e., every element $g$ of $G$ can be uniquely written as $hk$ for some $h \in H$ and $k \in K$. That means $K$ has one and only one representative of each orbit of the equivalence relation defined by $H$, and that means $K$ is isomorphic to $G/H$. Now, Bourbaki proceeds: ""Let $\pi$ be the operation of $K$ on $H$ by inner automorphisms of $G$. The mapping $(h, k) \mapsto hk$ is a isomorphism of $H \times_\pi K$ onto $G$"". I'm not sure I actually understand that last $\pi$ operation. If it defines a external semidirect product, it must be a homomorphism from $K$ to the automorphism group of $H$, so it must define a action of $K$ on $H$. When he mentions inner automorphisms of $G$, because $H$ is normal every inner automorphism of $G$ is a automorphism of $H$, and I guess the converse is also valid, so why couldn't $\pi$ be defined in terms of the group of automorphisms of $H$? Would it make it different? Does the set of inner automorphisms of $G$ and automorphisms of $H$ differ?",,"['abstract-algebra', 'group-theory', 'group-cohomology', 'group-extensions']"
