Taking reciprocals (which we can do since we are only consiering small $\theta > 0$ ) reverses the direction of the inequalities, so we have $\frac{1}{\tan \theta} < \frac{1}{\theta} < \frac{1}{\sin \theta}$ . Then, multiplying by $\sin \theta$ (which is positive), and noting that $\frac{\sin \theta}{\tan \theta} = \cos \theta$ , gives us $\cos \theta < \frac{\sin \theta}{\theta} < 1$ . Our calculation only establishes this inequality chain for $0 < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2}$ , but since all the terms are the same when we replace $\theta$ with $-\theta$ , it is true for all nonzero $\theta \in \big(-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}\big)$ . Furthermore, our above argument shows that $-\theta < \sin \theta < \theta$ for values of $\theta$ close to $0$ , and hence $\cos \theta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^{2} \theta} > \sqrt{1 - \theta^{2}} > 1 - \theta^{2}$ , so we have $1 - \theta^{2} < \cos \theta < \frac{\sin \theta}{\theta} < 1$ for values of $\theta$ sufficiently close to $0$ . Thus, by the Squeeze Theorem, since $\displaystyle{\lim_{\theta \to 0}} (1-\theta^{2}) = \displaystyle{\lim_{\theta \to 0}} 1 =1$ , we conclude that $\displaystyle{\lim_{\theta \to 0}}\frac{\sin \theta}{\theta} = 1$ .

It is filled to $\dfrac{2}{3}$ of its height with water, then the cup is tilted by an angle $\theta$ such that the water surface touches the rim of the cup (See attached image).  Find the tilt angle $\theta$ . My attempt: First, complete the frustum down to the vertex of the cone.  Compute the volume of the cone from the vertex to the water surface, let this volume be $V_0$ . Next, I derived that the ellipse of the cut has a semi-major axis length $a$ and semi-minor axis length $b$ where, $ a = \dfrac{ z_0 \tan \theta_c \cos \theta }{ 1 - \sin^2 \theta \sec^2 \theta_c } $ $ b = \dfrac{ z_0 \tan \theta_c \cos \theta }{ \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta \sec^2 \theta_c} } $ where $\theta_c$ is the semi-vertical angle of the cone (i.e. the angle between the axis of the cone and its surface). $z_0$ is the distance between the vertex and the intersection point of the axis with the cutting plane. $\theta$ is the acute angle between the axis of the cone and the normal vector to the cutting plane. In addition, the altitude of the tilted cone (the perpendicular distance between the vertex of the cone and the cutting plane) can be computed as $z_0 \cos \theta $ . Also, $z_0$ can be directly related to the slant height (along the side of the cup) and angles $\theta_c$ and $\theta$ . With all that, the volume of water in the tilted cup can be expressed as function of $\theta$ and equated to $V_0$ (the volume before tilting).  The resulting equation can be simplified into a simple trigonometric equation in double the angle $\theta$ , and can be solve for $\theta$ .

It is a modified form of zigzagging.  It differs from zigzagging in that every time the helmsman completes a new zig, instead of bringing the rudder amidships, he maintains a slight angle on the rudder.  If an ordinary zigzag course results in a sine curve , then constant helming results in a modified sine curve that does not have a point of inflection at x=π.  Instead of inflecting at x=π, the curve continues to bend until the next zig, when it begins to curve in the opposite direction.

95,Doubts in equations involving inverse tangent and inverse sine,Doubts in equations involving inverse tangent and inverse sine,,"My textbook solves the equation $\arctan x + \arcsin \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+9/4}}=\frac{\pi}{4}$ by taking the tangent both sides and using the identity $\tan(\alpha+\beta)=\frac{\tan \alpha + \tan \beta}{1-\tan \alpha \tan \beta}$ ; that approach leads to the solutions $x=-3 \vee x=1/2$ , but $x=-3$ is not a solution since $\arctan(-3)+\arcsin \frac{-3}{\sqrt{(-3)^2+9/4}}=-3\displaystyle\frac\pi4 \ne \displaystyle\frac\pi4$ . My questions are: i) I believe that the reason why there is a mistake (the extra wrong solution $x=-3$ ) is when the author takes the tangent both sides of the equation: the range of the function $f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(x)=\arctan x +\arcsin \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+9/4}}$ is $(-\pi, \pi)$ , so there are values of $f$ where $\tan f$ is not injective, that is for $x\in (-\pi,-\displaystyle\frac\pi2]\cup[\displaystyle\frac\pi2,\pi)$ , and thus, if I'm not wrong, the equation is not equivalent to the one that is obtained by taking tangent both sides because the implication $\tan(r)=\tan(s) \implies r=s$ is valid only where the tangent is injective. Maybe this can be solved by considering the two intervals $(-\pi,-\displaystyle\frac\pi2]\cup[\displaystyle\frac\pi2,\pi)$ , use the periodicity of the tangent to shift $x$ in an interval where the tangent is injective (for example, using $\tan(x+\pi)=\tan x$ for $x\in(-\pi,-\displaystyle\frac\pi2)$ , so that $\tan(x+\pi)$ is now injective for $x\in(-\pi,-\displaystyle\frac\pi2)$ ) and now use again the injectivity to apply tangent both sides. Is this the correct way to solve the equation? Using the injectivity in $(-\displaystyle\frac\pi2,\displaystyle\frac\pi2)$ and then consider other two cases for $(-\pi,-\displaystyle\frac\pi2]$ and $[\displaystyle\frac\pi2,\pi)$ to use again injectivity and consider the union of all the solutions set? ii) The identity $\tan(\alpha+\beta)=\frac{\tan \alpha + \tan \beta}{1-\tan \alpha \tan \beta}$ holds for $\alpha, \beta, \alpha+\beta \ne \displaystyle\frac\pi2+k\pi$ with $k\in\mathbb{Z}$ ; shouldn't I check that $\arctan x=\displaystyle\frac\pi2+k\pi$ , $\arcsin \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+9/4}}=\displaystyle\frac\pi2+k\pi$ and $f(x)=\displaystyle\frac\pi2+k\pi$ aren't solutions as well to not lose solutions after using the identity? Of course is obvious that $\arctan x \ne \displaystyle\frac\pi2+k\pi$ and $\arcsin \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+9/4}} \ne \displaystyle\frac\pi2+k\pi$ because they are bounded for values in $(-\displaystyle\frac\pi2,\displaystyle\frac\pi2)$ and $[-1,1]$ respectively, to me is not obvious to show that $f(x) \ne \displaystyle\frac\pi2+k\pi$ . Actually, I believe it is not always true: since $f$ is continuous and has image $(-\pi,\pi)$ , it follows that there exist $x_0,x_1$ such that $f(x_0)=\displaystyle\frac\pi2$ and $f(x_1)=-\displaystyle\frac\pi2$ (which are the only two values to check, because for $k \notin \{-1,0\}$ it is $\displaystyle\frac\pi2+k\pi \notin (-\pi,\pi)$ ); however, these are not solutions of $f(x)=\displaystyle\frac\pi4$ and so the equation is equivalent to the one obtained using the trigonometric identity for the angles sum of the tangent. Is this correct?","My textbook solves the equation by taking the tangent both sides and using the identity ; that approach leads to the solutions , but is not a solution since . My questions are: i) I believe that the reason why there is a mistake (the extra wrong solution ) is when the author takes the tangent both sides of the equation: the range of the function defined by is , so there are values of where is not injective, that is for , and thus, if I'm not wrong, the equation is not equivalent to the one that is obtained by taking tangent both sides because the implication is valid only where the tangent is injective. Maybe this can be solved by considering the two intervals , use the periodicity of the tangent to shift in an interval where the tangent is injective (for example, using for , so that is now injective for ) and now use again the injectivity to apply tangent both sides.

97,Find Interior Angles of Irregular Symmetrical Polygon,Find Interior Angles of Irregular Symmetrical Polygon,,"Apologies if this is has an obvious answer, but I've been stuck on this for a bit now. I've been trying to figure out how to make a symmetrical polygon with a base of m length, with n additional sides of s length using just those values, and I've gotten stuck. I'm not looking for an answer per se (although it would be appreciated). I'm looking for a next step that I might have overlooked. This shape has some given values and rules. n is the number of sides excluding the base, and must be at least 2 m can be any length between $0$ and $n \cdot s$ The shape is symmetrical, the line of symmetry is perpendicular to the base and $\frac{m}{2}$ from either endpoint of the base. In practice, s , n , and m are known values Here is a picture of what I am describing: In this example I've built the shape in reverse. I set $n=5$ , $s=3$ , and $\theta = 110 ^\circ$ . I've also found a relationship between the angles using the angle sum of a polygon: $$ \theta = 180 - \frac{2\zeta}{n-1}, \zeta= \frac{(180 - \theta)(n-1)}{2}$$ Using that (and Geogebra) I found that $\zeta = 140 ^\circ$ . But ideally, I would like to calculate $\theta$ from n , s , and m without setting $\theta$ beforehand. I'm looking for an equation for $\theta$ and $\zeta$ . I know their values relative to each other, but I haven't been able to figure out how to properly find these angles, aside from making triangles out of the entire thing, which I'm still unsure on where to start using just those values.
