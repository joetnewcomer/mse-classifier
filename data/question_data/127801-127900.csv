11,Finding all quotients of the braid group $B_5$ up to order $720$,Finding all quotients of the braid group  up to order,B_5 720,"Original Question. I am trying to find all quotients of the braid group $B_5$ on five strands up to order $6!=720$ . From previous very slow implementations I found that there are not many. Some results I have at my disposal are the following. All cyclic groups $C_n = \mathbb Z/n\mathbb Z$ are quotients of $B_5$ since the abelianization of $B_5$ is isomorphic to the integers $\mathbb Z$ . With the same argument we obtain that non-cyclic abelian groups cannot be quotients of $B_5$ . One can construct an automorphism, namely conjugation by the image of $\delta = \sigma_1 \cdots \sigma_{n-1}$ , of order divisible by $n$ , yielding that all quotients of $B_5$ must have order divisible by $5$ . Applying this to the subgroups $B_3$ and $B_4$ yields that any quotient of $B_5$ must have order divisible by $60$ , which drastically (but not drastically enough) decreases the number of groups to check. The permutation group $S_5$ is a quotient of $B_5$ by modding out the squares of the generators. Implementations showed that a subdirect product $A_5 \rtimes C_4$ and a direct product $C_3 \times S_5$ are also quotients of $B_5$ , but I do not know the explicit homomorphism. What I tried is to use the function AllSmallGroups in GAP, which really does return all groups of the desired order very efficiently (presumably because they are stored in a pre-computed list). I then checked whether the list returned by GQuotients was non-empty, which is apperently quite expensive to compute. Considering I have to check thousands of groups this is a problem. One approach I might have is to filter out the groups that have normal subgroups such that the quotient is non-cyclic and has order not divisible by $60$ . Sadly, the method StructureDescription takes ages to run on groups of the magnitudes of orders I am intersted in, so I cannot really check this efficiently. Thus, to answer my question I guess it would be enough to answer the following. How can you (more efficiently than using StructureDescription or the like) check whether a group returned by AllSmallGroups (or something similar) satisfies that the orders of all the quotients by its normal subgroups are divisible by $60$ ? Update. Alright, I managed to solve it. Here's the result: All non-cyclic quotients of order less than $720$ are either $A_5 \rtimes \mathbb Z/2^k \mathbb Z$ or $C_{2k+1} \times S_5$ . What it took was the following (thanks @AlexanderKonovalov): Get a list of IDs of SmallGroup s with IdsOfSmallGroups (less demanding on my workspace memory than using AllSmallGroups ). This gave me about $3000$ groups. Filter out the abelian groups: very easy with the precomputed IsAbelian attribute. I'm actually not sure how important that was since it only reduced my count from about $3000$ to about $2900$ groups, but still. Getting the normal subgroups of all those groups with NormalSubgroups and checking whether all quotients were either cyclic or had order divisible by $60$ . Throwing the rest away left me with $46$ groups. I then let my computer run for the whole day using GQuotients . It was able to check a remarkable $25$ groups during this time. I got a bit annoyed and ran StructureDescription on the group it was currently working at and found that it was working on a group that was somehow a direct product of $\mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z$ with some matrix group (which was previously identified as not a quotient). Since it only took a few seconds to run StructureDescription I decided to let it run on all of the remaining groups, and, miraculously, it finished this feat in half a minute or so. By hand I removed the ones that split as a direct product or a subdirect product the normal subgroup of which I knew was not a quotient, and had to run GQuotients on a single remaining group, which turned out to be not a quotient. What occurred to me a little bit too late is that I could have introduced a step 2.5 checking whether the groups in question had a generating set consisting of only two elements. This would have reduced to groups from $2900$ to about $2000$ , which would have saved maybe $5$ minutes of computing normal subgroups of stuff. But it turns out that all of the $46$ groups that required me to check by hand would not have been excluded by this step, so this is more of a side note.","Original Question.

Another idea was to do the same while looking at a minimal counterexample, but it was not clear to me why those $p$-complements should themselves satisfy the conditions (and hence, the minimality was not much use).",,"['group-theory', 'finite-groups']"

98,Confused about the group of permutations $S_{n}$,Confused about the group of permutations,S_{n},"In an exercise, I must prove $S_{n}$ is generated by 2 elements. I'll ignore here the trivial case $n = 1$. Let $I_{n} = \{1, 2, 3, ..., n\}$. I then defined $f : I_{n} \rightarrow I_{n}$ by $f(1) = 2$, $f(2) = 1$, and $f(i) = i,$ for $i \neq 1, 2$. Also $g : I_{n} \rightarrow I_{n}$ by $g(1) = n$ and $g(i + 1) = i$ for $i \in \{1, ..., n - 1\}$. I claimed $f, g$ generate $S_{n}$, which is apparently correct. But my explanation is apparently completely wrong. I hope someone may undo my confusion. So intuitively, $f$ is a swap permutation which swaps the first two elements, and $g$ is a shift permutation which shifts everything to the left. We note any permutation can be written as a series of ""swaps"" (transpositions). So it suffices to show $f, g$ generate the swaps. So suppose I want to compose $f$ and $g$ in such a way to swap $1 \leq i < j \leq n$. The algorithm would go somewhat like this: shift everything to the left until $i$ is the first element. Now apply swap once, then shift back again, apply swap, shift back, and so forth until you just swapped $i$ with $j$. Count how many times you shifted left after you first swapped. Now you shift right (which is just the inverse of shifting left), swap, shift right, swap, .. and do that just as many times as you shifted left. In the end you should be left with exactly $i, j$ swapped and everything else in its place. Let's do an example. Suppose I want to swap 1 and 4 in 1234. It'll go as: 2134 (swapped) 1342 (shifted left 1 time) 3142 (swapped) 1423 (shifted left 2 times) 4123 (swapped 4 and 1; I'll start shifting right now) 3412 (shifted right 1 time) 4312 (swapped) 2431 (shifted right 2 times) 4231 (swapped) And we are done! Apparently the problem with this is that $f$ doesn't actually swap the first and second elements, there is no order, it just swaps 1 with 2. Under which interpretation this makes little sense. My question is: is my way of thinking about this completely wrong? Is it merely coincidental that I achieved a correct answer? And if it is wrong, how should I be thinking about permutations? I am not familiar with the cycle notation.","In an exercise, I must prove $S_{n}$ is generated by 2 elements. I'll ignore here the trivial case $n = 1$. Let $I_{n} = \{1, 2, 3, ..., n\}$. I then defined $f : I_{n} \rightarrow I_{n}$ by $f(1) = 2$, $f(2) = 1$, and $f(i) = i,$ for $i \neq 1, 2$. Also $g : I_{n} \rightarrow I_{n}$ by $g(1) = n$ and $g(i + 1) = i$ for $i \in \{1, ..., n - 1\}$. I claimed $f, g$ generate $S_{n}$, which is apparently correct. But my explanation is apparently completely wrong. I hope someone may undo my confusion. So intuitively, $f$ is a swap permutation which swaps the first two elements, and $g$ is a shift permutation which shifts everything to the left. We note any permutation can be written as a series of ""swaps"" (transpositions). So it suffices to show $f, g$ generate the swaps. So suppose I want to compose $f$ and $g$ in such a way to swap $1 \leq i < j \leq n$. The algorithm would go somewhat like this: shift everything to the left until $i$ is the first element. Now apply swap once, then shift back again, apply swap, shift back, and so forth until you just swapped $i$ with $j$. Count how many times you shifted left after you first swapped. Now you shift right (which is just the inverse of shifting left), swap, shift right, swap, .. and do that just as many times as you shifted left. In the end you should be left with exactly $i, j$ swapped and everything else in its place. Let's do an example. Suppose I want to swap 1 and 4 in 1234. It'll go as: 2134 (swapped) 1342 (shifted left 1 time) 3142 (swapped) 1423 (shifted left 2 times) 4123 (swapped 4 and 1; I'll start shifting right now) 3412 (shifted right 1 time) 4312 (swapped) 2431 (shifted right 2 times) 4231 (swapped) And we are done!

99,What is the reason for the name *left* coset?,What is the reason for the name *left* coset?,,"Let $G$ be a group and let $H \leq G$ be a subgroup. It seems that it is now standard to call the cosets  $$gH=\{gh \ | h \in H \}$$ the left cosets of $H$ in $G$. I have to admit to being slightly annoyed with this convention: these are the orbits for the right action of $H$ on $G$. Therefore I am perpetually tempted to refer to them as right cosets. Is there a second good reason (I happily admit convention is a very good reason) for calling these left cosets?
