Then $n + 1 , n + 3 , n + 4 $ can't be taken. We make a small claim. $\bullet~$ Claim: In a set of $~7$ consecutive numbers at most $2$ numbers can be chosen. $\bullet~$ $\textbf{Proof:}$ Let us name the elements of the set as $\{ 1,2,3,\dots,7 \}$ . Now let's consider the least element is chosen. If the least element is $1$ , then $2,4,5$ can't be chosen. So we are left with $3, 6, 7$ . $\circ~$ If $~3~$ is chosen, then $6, 7$ can't be in the set. And if $~3~$ is not chosen, then only any one of the 2 elements $\{ 6, 7  \}$ be chosen. So, a maximum of $2$ elements can be chosen in this case. $\circ \circ~$ If the least element is $2,$ then $3, 5, 6$ can't be there in the set. So, possible elements are 4, 7. So,  one of these two can be chosen. Then, a maximum of 2 elements can be chosen in this case. $\circ \circ~$ If the least element is $3$ , then $4,6,7$ gets cancelled. so only $5$ is left in the set i.e., $2$ elements at most. $\circ \circ~$ If the least element is $4,$ then $5,7$ gets cancelled. So the only element left is $6$ . Similarly, $\circ \circ~$ If $5$ is the least element then $6$ gets cancelled and only $7$ is left. i.e., two elements. If the least element is either $6$ or $7$ , then there is only one element. So a maximum of two elements in a set of $7$ consecutive elements can be chosen. Hence, the proof of the claim is done! So, for $42$ elements, a maximum of $2 \times 6 = 12$ can be taken. However, $3$ more elements are required from $3$ more consecutive elements, which is not possible since only 2 elements at most can be chosen from a set of 3 consecutive elements. So, a $14$ element subset can be formed such that, no two of them differ by $1, 3, 4$ . Hence the $15$ th element is one of the cancelled elements, that is, there exists a pair with their difference being $1, 3$ or $4.$ Hence, done!

For example, if $n=2$, then $\mathcal{G}:=\{\begin{pmatrix} 1\\ 1 \end{pmatrix},\begin{pmatrix} 1\\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 0\\ 1 \end{pmatrix} , \begin{pmatrix} 0\\ 0 \end{pmatrix}\}$ with $|\mathcal{G}|=4$. Question: For $M=2,...,|\mathcal{G}|-1$, I want to count all possible sets $C\subset \mathcal{G}$ with cardinality $M$ such that: there exists a non-empty set $D\subset C$ such that for every pair of matrices, one taken from $D$ and the other taken from $C-D$, the two matrices in the pair considered differ for at least two rows. Is this counting possible? If not, is there any known upper bound or lower bound? I have looked at this question whose comments link to bounds for binary constant weight codes , but it does not seem to help. [$C-D$ denotes the complement of $D$ in $C$]. For example: when $n=2$ the result is $2$. Indeed, for $M=2$, we can have $$ C=\{\begin{pmatrix} 1\\ 1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 0\\ 0 \end{pmatrix}\}  $$ where $D=\{\overbrace{\begin{pmatrix} 1\\ 1 \end{pmatrix}}^{d_1}\}$, $C-D=\{\overbrace{\begin{pmatrix} 0\\ 0 \end{pmatrix}}^{c_1}\}$, row $1$ of $d_1$ $\neq $ row $1$ of $c_1$, and row $2$ of $d_1$ $\neq $ row $2$ of $c_1$ and $$ C=\{\begin{pmatrix} 0\\ 1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 1\\ 0 \end{pmatrix}\}  $$ where $D=\{\overbrace{\begin{pmatrix} 0\\ 1 \end{pmatrix}}^{d_1}\}$, $C-D=\{\overbrace{\begin{pmatrix} 1\\ 0 \end{pmatrix}}^{c_1}\}$, row $1$ of $d_1$ $\neq $ row $1$ of $c_1$, and row $2$ of $d_1$ $\neq $ row $2$ of $c_1$ For $M=3$, there is no $C$ satisfying the considered criterion.

11,Minimum Moves to Sort $n\times n$ Array,Minimum Moves to Sort  Array,n\times n,"I was trying to create a new game where you are given randomized $n\times n$ matrix $A$ with distinct elements taken from the set $\{1,2,...,n^2\}$. The goal is to sort the matrix in minimum number of moves such that $a_{i,j}=(i-1)n +j$ after sorting.

Motivation: In statistical mechanics, a large number of indistinguishable ""microstates"" of a system may correspond to a single ""macrostate"", and the entropy of that macrostate is defined as the log of it's number of microstates. The motivation is to define an analogous entropy for graphs, where the microstates are the graphs and the macrostates are the isomorphism classes.

Within this question I wanted to know whether it is possible to draw a Venn diagram with rectangles for $n>3$ under the restriction that the rectangles are having the same width and height as well as being axis-aligned (not rotated). By his Bound 2 Alex Ravsky pointed out that this is not possible for $n>5$. However, Barry Cipra then showed that it is not possible for $n\ge4$. Now I want to go a little bit deeper into the number of regions of a Venn diagram. Therefore I also consider axis-aligned rectangles with the same width and height. The rectangles are not rotated. Preliminaries A Venn diagram cannot be drawn with rectangles for $n\ge4$ Interpreting a Venn diagram geometrically, it forms $2^n$ regions, which is $2^n=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom{n}{k}$ The second preliminary implies, that a Venn diagram has $\binom{n}{k}$ regions where exactly $k$ rectangles intersect (i.e. overlap). Using the first preliminary, this formula is geometrically valid for $n<4$. As a Venn diagram with rectangles can't be drawn for $n\ge4$, at least how many regions can be formed using $n$ rectangles (is there an upper bound?)? The maximum possible number of regions that can be formed using $n$ rectangles is $2+n(n-1)$. What is the maximum possible number of regions where exactly $k$ rectangles intersect? For the first question I made the following considerations: Let $a_n$ define the maximum number of regions which can be formed using $n$ rectangles. Imagine $n-1$ already aligned rectangles that produce $a_{n-1}$ regions. Now arrange the $n$-th rectangle in a way so that it intersects each of the $n-1$ rectangles in two distinct points (this maximizes the number of regions). This produces two new regions for every intersection of the $n-1$ already aligned rectangles. Thus, $a_n=a_{n-1}+2(n-1)$ with $a_1=2$. Using the iteration method for recursion yields $a_n=n^2-n+2$.

35,Two formulas for the minimal eigenvalue of a graph,Two formulas for the minimal eigenvalue of a graph,,"Hello again everybody, I'm reading Fan Chung's monograph Spectral Graph Theory . In it, she has two formulas for the minimal eigenvalue of a graph.  She doesn't explain why they're equivalent, and I'm having difficulty justifying it.  Below, I'll explain everything and state my question precisely. Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph and let $d_v$ denote the degree of $v\in V$. Let $T$ denote the diagonal matrix whose $(v,v)^{\text{th}}$ entry is $d_v$. The Laplacian $\mathcal{L}$ of $G$ is the matrix defined by $$ \mathcal{L}_{i,j} := \Bigg\{ \begin{array}{cc} 1 & \text{if } u=v \\ -1/\sqrt{d_v d_u} & \text{if } \{u,v\} \in E \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{array} $$ The eigenvalues $\lambda_0 \leq \lambda_1 \leq \dots \leq \lambda_{n-1}$ of $\mathcal{L}$ are called the eigenvalues of $G$.  Since it's not too hard to show that $0=\lambda_0$ for every graph, we call $\lambda_1$ the minimal eigenvalue of $G$. Since $\mathcal{L}$ is Hermitian, its eigenvalues are all nonnegative reals and the minimal eigenvalue is determined by the Rayleigh-Ritz ratio (see, e.g. Theorem 4.2.2 of Horn & Johnson): $$ \lambda_1 = \min \frac{\langle g,\mathcal{L}g \rangle}{\langle g,g\rangle} $$ Here the minimum is taken over all $g : V\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ not identically $0$, which we think of as length-#$V$ real vectors.  With some algebraic manipulation that ratio becomes  $$ \lambda_1 = \inf \frac{\sum_{\{u,v\}\in E} (f(u)-f(v))^2}{\sum_v f(v)^2d_v} $$ where $g=T^{-1/2} f$ and the infimum is taken over all functions $f$ such that $f \bot T1$ where $1$ is the all-$1$ vector. That formula makes sense, I think.  However, later (in the proof of theorem 2.2) she states that  $$ \lambda_1 = \frac{\sum_{v \in V_+} f(v) \sum_{\{u,v\}\in E_+} (f(v)-f(u))}{\sum_{v\in V_+} f^2(v) d_v} $$ where $V_+ := \{ v : f(v) \geq 0\}$ and $E_+ := \{ \{u,v\} \in E : u \text { or } v \in V_+\}$. I can't understand why these two formulas for $\lambda_1$ are equivalent.  Chung's silence on this point may be because the equivalence is obvious.

""Let $A$ be a finite set of positive integers. Then, the set $A + A - A$ contains more or equally as many positive elements than negative elements.

Then $A+A-A = \{-1, 2, 5, 8\}$ The nature of this problem lies in the duplicants that can occur.

For every element $x$ in $A-A$ , $-x$ also occurs in $A-A$ . This means that for every negative element, there also exists a unique positive element. Next we look at the set $a_1 + A - A$ . This just shifts $A-A$ to the right. Some negative elements might change into positive ones, but we do not care about that. What is important is, that every positive element stays positive.

I want to prove at each step that there are still more or equal positive than negative elements in the current set. My idea to do this is to think of the following: Since $A-A$ was symmetric around $0$ , I can split $A-A$ into elements that are $>0$ and elements that are $<0$ (we do not care about the $0$ ).

40,Coloring a Generalized Latin Square,Coloring a Generalized Latin Square,,"Suppose we have an $n \times n$ array, and there is a decomposition $\mathcal{A}$ of its coordinates $a_{i,j}$ into sets $A_m$ as follows: If $a_{i,j} \in A_m$ , then $a_{j,i} \in A_m$ .  So they're symmetrical pieces of the array (across the diagonal). If $a_{i,j}, a_{i,k} \in A_m$ and $j \neq k$ then $a_{j,k} \in A_m$ .  Similarly, if $a_{j,i}, a_{k,i} \in A_m$ and $j \neq k$ then $a_{j,k} \in A_m$ .  So the relations are transitive, in a sense. If a diagonal coordinate $a_{i,i}$ is contained in $A_m$ , then $A_m = \lbrace a_{i,i} \rbrace$ is a singleton. The question is this: Thinking of the $A_m$ 's as chunks of the $n \times n$ array, can we apply a color to each $A_m$ so that the array satisfies a 'Latin Square' condition using at most $n$ colors, i.e. within any row or column no color appears more than once unless they belong to the same $A_m$ ?  So, every entry in any fixed $A_M$ will all have the same color, and we color the square 'up to $\mathcal{A}$ .'

I read all the information theoretic intuitions on the web, but I have not exactly been able to understand what information is, what does it mean to gain information. I would love a combination of intuitive and formal(!) explanation of this information aspect (so your explanation must explain why $log(1/p)$ is the correct value, since it is not always an integer so it's not exactly about representing with bits, although I'm also willing to accept an asymptotic result, similiar to Shannons theorem). In my effort I have also read the proof of Shannons theorem on decoding in order to try and get intuition from there ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon%27s_source_coding_theorem ). I think I might have got some, so I'd like to verify it (this gives me intuition as to why Entropy is an important function, and how it is relevant to compressing, but I don't know how to perfectly transfer this to information intuitively, espcially since Shannons theorem talks about high probability). So to verify I understand correctly, it seems to me that entropy (given the setting in the article, we have a sequence of IID variables) is a sort of an approximation to what we would really love to understand, which is the distribution of $P(X_1=x_1,X_2=x_2,..X_n=x_n)$ , however this is very complicated (just calculating the expected value is difficult). So intead, we consider the log of this, where we can now use the strong\weak law of large numbers and understand the distribution very well, and then we can go back to what interested us with a good approximation. So my question is consisted of 3 parts: $1$ What is this information thing more formally? $2$ Is my understanding of the intuition in compressing as I wrote above correct? $3$ Is there a way to transfer this intuition (in the case that it is correct) to an information theoretic one, because assuming I'm correct about the above, I feel comfortable with this, so I would understand the information theoretic point of view well? My objective is that as many of the formulas involving entorpy will be trivial from our intuition. I will update here whenever I understand another one. Since everytihng happens with higih probability about encoding, with union bound everything will be good, I'm just going to assume it is always satisfied to make the writing smoother. For example, we easily get (using my intuition of compressing) that $H((X,Y))<=H(X)+H(Y),$ since in both cases with high probability we can encode well, therefore by union bound with high probabiliy we can encode well for both of them, and we can just concatenate the encodings. Let's see why there must be equality if they are independent. If we look at the proof of Shannons theorem, we saw there that $P(x_1,x_2..x_n)$ is about $2^{(-nH(x))}$ , and the same for $Y$ . So clearly we have $P(x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2,..)$ is about $2^{(-nH(x))}2^{(-nH(y))}=2^{(-n(H(x)+H(y))}$ which is what we wanted. Now let's do conditional entropy.

See here for proof . It is also true there are more surjections from $B$ to $A$ than injections from $A$ to $B$. One way to prove this is as follows: Create a bipartite graph in which he vertices in one part are the injections from $A$ to $B$ and the vertices in the other part are the surjections from $B$ to $A$. Connect two vertices if and only if they are inverses (on the appropriate sides) of each other. injective functions have $(|A|)^{|B|-|A|}$ left inverses. On the other hand the number of right inverses a surjective function can have depends on the function itself. It is the product of the order of the pullbacks of all the singletons in the image. So then it is the product of $A$ numbers which add $B$ and hence by AM-GM it is bounded by $(\frac{|B|}{|A|})^{|A|}$ Therefore we have $I(|A|)^{|B|-|A|}\leq S(\frac{|B|}{|A|})^{|A|}$ where $I$ is the number of injective functions and $S$ of surjective functions. This is because the sum of the degrees of each of the two parts of a bipartite graph is equal. Therefore $\frac{S}{I}\leq\frac{|A|^{|B-|A|} |A|^{|A|}}{|B|^{|A|}}=\frac{|A|^{|B|}}{|B|^{|A|}}$.

On the other the functions from $B$ to $A$ and from $A$ to $B$ are in ratio $\frac{|A|^{|B|}}{|B|^{|A|}}$. Therefore the number of injective functions are a smaller percentage of the functions from $A$ to $B$ than the surjective functions are from $B$ to $A$. This leads me to believe being surjective is ""easier"" than being injective. Follow up questions:Let $|A|<|B|$ for arbitrary sets $A$ and $B$. Is there a way to prove there are more injective functions from $A$ to $B$ than surjective functions from $B$ to $A$? Is there a way to prove $|A^B|\geq |B^A|$? Is there a way to express the fact that surjections are ""easier"" to find in infinite sets? Would this be true?

50,"Fold, Gather, Cut","Fold, Gather, Cut",,"Here's a mathematical puzzle I've been thinking about.  Let's say you have a strip of fabric, of length $N$ units ($N$ being an integer), which has regular markings on it every 1 unit along its length.  Your task is to cut the fabric into $N$ lengths of 1 unit each, but to do so using the fewest operations possible.  The operations available to you are: Cut - you may cut through any number of overlapping layers in a single operation.  All cuts must be through the 1-unit markings on the fabric, and the cut must be in a straight line.  (No using a wavy cut to do the whole thing in 1 operation.) Gather - you may gather any number of already-cut lengths together in a bundle.  They must all line up on one end.  (If they are the same lengths, they will of course line up on both ends.) Fold - You may fold any number of layers of fabric in either direction.  Multiple folds can only be counted as 1 operation if the places to be folded are already lined up, either via a previous Gather or another Fold step.  Unlike Cuts, a Fold may occur between the 1-unit markings.  Unfolding does not require an additional operation. Now it can be trivially shown that for any $N$ which is $2^k$, an ideal solution would be to have $k$ Cuts alternating with $k-1$ Gathers, for a total of $2k - 1$ operations.  This is by no means the only ideal solution.  For example, consider $N=8$.  The steps could be: Cut into 2 lengths of 4. Gather lengths. Cut into 4 lengths of 2. Gather lengths. Cut into 8 lengths of 1. Or you could do the following: Fold at the 3rd marking. Fold at the 5th marking the other direction. Cut down the middle to get 4 lengths of 2 (2 of which are folded). Gather lengths. Cut into 8 lengths of 1. Still 5 steps either way.  It gets trickier when you consider other numbers however.  Say, for $N=9$, you could take any $N=8$ solution, and then add 1 more cut for that last piece that will be 1 unit too long.  But you can do 9 in 5 steps as well: Fold in half. Cut at the 3rd and 6th markings (which should be lined up) to get 3 lengths of 3. Gather lengths. Fold all 3 in half again. Cut into 9 lengths of 1.

54,Can you win the urn depletion game?,Can you win the urn depletion game?,,"In the urn depletion game , you are given several transparent urns containing various colored balls. (For the purposes of this problem, let us assume there are $k=2$ different available ball colors, red and blue.) You can easily see all of the contents of all of the urns, and pick out any ball from them at will. You win the game if you can remove all of the balls from the urns, subject to the following constraints: You may only remove one ball at a time. You may not pick from the same urn twice in a row. I will tell you, each time, what color of ball you must remove. Concretely, assume I give you a list in advance describing what color you must pick out each turn. The decision problem is: Given a setup of urns and colored balls, and given the ordered list of color requirements, is it possible to win? Example: You have urns containing [RB] [RB].  If the instructions are to remove them in the order red, blue, blue, red you can win. In contrast, if you must remove them in the order red, blue, red, blue, there is no way to win because you cannot draw from the same urn twice in a row. I am wondering whether this problem is in P, or whether, for example, it's NP-complete. It's a little similar to some other NP-complete problems, but it also seems at least superficially less expressive and I haven't been able to find a reduction. I've found several special cases that are in P. I know that if there's only one ball color ( $k=1$ ), then the problem is in P. My algorithm is to always remove a ball from the urn with the most balls (among the urns you're allowed to pick), breaking ties arbitrarily. If it's possible to win, this algorithm will win. (Note that it's still possible to have an unwinnable game even if $k=1$ , if there's too great a discrepancy in urn contents. For example, the game [R] [RRRR] is unwinnable.) I also know that if all balls have a unique color, then the problem is also in P. This is because then the color list uniquely determines the path you take (no branching factors), and you can check whether it's valid in polynomial time. More generally, if the color of the ball uniquely determines the urn it's in, then the problem is in P. And if there are only two urns, then no matter how many colors $k$ there are, the path must zigzag between them, and there are only two possible paths. You can check in polynomial time whether either path is legal. But I haven't solved the $k=2$ case, and I'm stumped on an algorithm or reduction. Edit: I've found if we allow for an unlimited number of colors, the problem becomes NP-complete, but I'm not  sure about just two colors. Edit: As @Artimis points out below, if we restrict to problems where the number of urns is at most U, or where the number of balls per urn is at most B, this special case can be shown to be in P, as there are a polynomial number of things to check.

68,Subset of a conjugacy class of of an odd permutation in $S_n$,Subset of a conjugacy class of of an odd permutation in,S_n,"Let $\sigma=(1,2,3,\dots,n)$ be an odd $n-$ cycle in $S_n$ (so $n$ is even). It is known that the size of its conjugacy class is $|cl_{S_n}(\sigma)|=(n-1)!$ . I am interested in the size of the subset $S=cl_{cl_{S_n}(\sigma)}(\sigma)$ , that is, the set of all the $n-$ cycles that we can obtain by conjugating $\sigma$ only with elements in its conjugacy class. In particular, I would like to show that $S$ contains at least $|cl_{S_n}(\sigma)|/2=(n-1)!/2$ elements, which happens to seem true in the numerical experiments I run. Approaches I tried: Construct enough elements by hand. I found this trick: If we conjugate $\sigma=(1,2,3,\dots,n)$ by $(1, a_1, 3, a_3, 5, a_5, \dots, 4, a_4, 2, a_2, n)$ for a free choice of the $a_i$ in the set of the remaining half symbols, we obtain a permutation sending $(1,a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,\dots,a_{n/2-1},\dots)$ . This way it is possible to produce explicitly some mutually different elements, but still not enough. By elementary group theory, two elements $\alpha,\beta\in S$ are such that $\alpha\sigma\alpha^{-1}=\beta\sigma\beta^{-1}$ if and only if $\beta=\alpha\sigma^k$ for some even power $k$ of $\sigma$ . This way we obtain that $S$ contains at least $\frac{(n-1)!}{n/2-1}$ elements, still too few, unfortunately, due to the denominator depending on $n$ (but observe that this case solves the case $n=6$ ). Notes: The fact that we are choosing as $\sigma$ that particular odd cycle is just a simplification of the original problem. This claim still seems to be true for any odd permutation $\sigma\in S_n$ for every $n$ big enough to contain $\sigma$ . I feel that this problem is not impossible, and just a clever simple counting trick is needed. Thanks in advance for any suggestions or comments.","Let be an odd cycle in (so is even).

While my problem isn't the same as the one I have just shown, they both seem to have some sort of connection (they are both extremal graph theory problems). Any help regarding this will be appreciated. Btw, I don't expect there to be an answer to this question.",,"['combinatorics', 'graph-theory', 'contest-math']"

This is an original problem. Suppose instead of ""describing"" the numbers in a string in order, one counts the digits globally and, for convention, lists then in numerical order. That is, whereas in Conway's sequence $21\rightarrow 1211$, in my version, $21\rightarrow 1112$. Starting with the initial string 1, an interesting thing happens at the 13th iteration: we come upon the string $21322314$ which ""describes"" itself. We may think of this as a fixed point in the iteration process. At this point, a distinction needs to be made. I'd like to be able to answer questions about general strings, including those with numbers of more than one digit. That is, I'd like to be able to discuss strings which naturally lead to, say, ten 1's or thirteen 4's. Once a multi-digit number is in a string, we have a choice. We may either respect the integrity of the number or split it into its constituent digits. For example, we may either say ""13 is one 1 and one 3"" or ""13 is one $\underline{13}$."" Call these varations A and B. Here are some questions I've thought about regarding this sequence: Does every string in variations A and B terminate? That is, does the process lead to a fixed point. I have answered this question for A in the affirmative, but not for B. I strongly suspect it holds for B as well. Notice that sometimes strings can terminate in a nontrivial cycle: notationally, $$S_1→S_2→...→S_n→S_1.$$ Call this a cycle of length $n$. (The biggest cycle I've found from experimentation is of length 6). Assuming strings terminate in both A and B and given an arbitrary string $S$, can one put an upper bound on on the cycle length of its eventual fixed point? Further, given an arbitrary string $S$ in A or B, what can one say about the amount of iterations it takes for $S$ to terminate? What about its eventually string length? Suppose we abandon talk of ""strings"" and instead think of the objects as multisets. This is natural given how much multiplicity matters in this discussion. Let $M_\mathbb{N}$ denote the set of multisets with elements in $\mathbb{N}$. Then the process of ""looking and saying"" is a function $J:M_\mathbb{N}\rightarrow M_\mathbb{N}$. Is there a natural way to impose meaningful structure on $M_\mathbb{N}$ so that the above questions involving $J$ are easier to answer? (For example, if there were a way to define addition, so that if $S\in C_1$ and $T\in C_2$ and $S+T\in C_3$ for equivalence classes $C_i$, then a homomorphism respecting this would be nice.) (Personally, my favorite question.) Say two strings $S$ and $T$ are similar if they terminate in the same cycle. This is clearly an equivalence relation and it thus partitions $M_\mathbb{N}$. In variation B, it seems clear that there are infinitely many equivalence classes. In variation A, however, the fixed points are artifacts of the base $b$ in which we construe the strings. In this variation, how many equivalence classes are there as a function of $b$? Just a heads up: I've had several practicing mathematicians who work in various fields tell me that this question is unfeasibly difficult.

I thought that I could somehow rewrite the sum $$F_n+\cdots+F_{n+7}$$ into some sort of rearrangement of $F_n$'s and $F_{n+1}$'s. Could anyone help me show that the sum of 8 consecutive Fibonacci numbers is not a Fibonacci number? Thanks","While studying Fibonacci numbers, I came up with this problem.

99,Prove $\sum_{k=0}^{n}\frac{n!}{k!}(n-k)n^k=n^{n+1}$ for any $n\in\mathbb N$.,Prove  for any .,\sum_{k=0}^{n}\frac{n!}{k!}(n-k)n^k=n^{n+1} n\in\mathbb N,"I want to prove the following: $$\sum_{k=0}^{n}\frac{n!}{k!}(n-k)n^k=n^{n+1}\quad\text{for any $n\in\mathbb N$.}$$ I tried induction and invoking the binomial theorem, to little avail. I’m looking for some quick and dirty solution. Thanks for any hints. As the answers below reveal, the following update I had added earlier is not really of much use, so I struck it. Update: After some rearrangements, the left-hand side above can be rewritten as $$\require{enclose}      \enclose{horizontalstrike}{n\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\binom{n-1}{k}n^k(n-k)!}$$ This form seems to suggest resorting to the binomial theorem.","I want to prove the following: $$\sum_{k=0}^{n}\frac{n!}{k!}(n-k)n^k=n^{n+1}\quad\text{for any $n\in\mathbb N$.}$$ I tried induction and invoking the binomial theorem, to little avail.
