23,Nets - preoredered sets or posets?,Nets - preoredered sets or posets?,,"Question: Usually net is defined as a function from a directed preordered set to a topological space. What would we lose or gain if we worked with partially ordered directed sets only? Background and motivation For me, one of the most important property of nets in topological spaces is the following: Let $X$ be a topological space, $x\in X$ and $A\subseteq x$ . Then $x\in\overline A$ if and only if there exists a net $(x_d)_{d\in D}$ such that $x_d$ converges to $x$ and $x_d\in A$ for each $d\in D$ . The above property means that topology of $X$ is uniquely determined by convergence of nets. The above property would be true also if we worked only with nets on directed posets. Indeed, let $x\in\overline A$ . Let $\mathcal N_x$ be the set of all open neighborhoods of $x$ . Then $D=(\mathcal N_x,\supseteq)$ is a poset, which is directed. For any $U$ choose one element $x_U\in A\cap U$ . Then the net $(x_U)_{U\in\mathcal N_x}$ converges to $x$ . So, if I did not make a mistake in this proof, the above property is true also if we work only with nets on posets. In some constructions it is useful that we are allowed to work with nets on preordered sets. One of them is constructing a net corresponding to a given filter $\mathcal F$ such that this net converges to $x$ if and only if the filter $\mathcal F$ does. Here the net on the set $\{(A,a); a\in A\in \mathcal F\}$ preordered by $$(A,a)\le (B,b) \Leftrightarrow A\supseteq B$$ is used, and this is indeed a preordered set, not a partially ordered set. See the part on correspondence of nets and filters in P. L. Clark's notes on convergence for more details and other related constructions. In fact, P. L. Clark writes here that this ""justifies our willingness to entertain directed quasi-ordered sets"". (This answers to some extent my question. But I guess that the authors working with posets also have some reasons to do so.) Another possible viewpoint: For any class $\mathcal C$ of directed sets we can define the class of topological spaces defined by the property: $V$ is closed in $X$ if and only if $V$ is closed w.r.t. limits of nets on directed set from $\mathcal C$ . If $\mathcal C$ = all directed sets, then we get all topological spaces. If $\mathcal C=\{\mathbb N\}$ , then we get sequential spaces If $\mathcal C=$ well-ordered sets or $\mathcal C=$ linearly ordered sets, then we get pseudoradial spaces So in this context we can view this question as the question what we get if $\mathcal C$ =directed posets (which seems quite natural, after seeing that several classes of spaces arise in this way).

See (C1) at the end. Firstly, I believe this is the definition for local homeomorphism onto image : Let $M$ and $N$ be topological spaces. Let $F: N \to M$ be a map. We say $F$ is a local homeomorphism onto its image , $F(N)$ (under the subspace topology) if $\tilde F: N \to F(N)$ is a local homeomorphism Now, any subset $A$ of a topological space $B$ can always be made into a topological space by making $A$ a topological subspace of $B$ with the subspace topology. This does not hold for (smooth) manifolds: If $B$ is now a manifold, then we can't always make $A$ into a manifold too. However apparently, we can discuss whether or not $A$ is ""diffeomorphic"" to other manifolds or any subset of any manifolds by this . My issue then is translating the above definition for local homeomorphism onto image to ""local diffeomorphism onto image"": I'm not sure if $F(N)$ is a manifold, specifically a regular/an embedded submanifold (I guess we need this specifically just as we need subspace topology for local homeomorphism onto image). I have the seen the term ""local diffeomorphism onto image "" in 3 separate posts, and I would like to clarify the definition. From this question: Does the Riemannian metric induced by a diffeomorphism $F$ exist for a reason other than the existence of vector field pushforwards? You can pull back the metric as long as $F_∗$ is injective on the tangent space (so $F$ is a local diffeo onto image).

From this question: Embedding, local diffeomorphism, and local immersion theorem. However, by the local coordinates condition you've imposed, the differential is full-rank, and so $f$ is a local diffeomorphism onto its image.

Local diffeomorphism onto image: A map $f:X\to Y$ , is a local diffeomorphism onto image , if for each point x in X, there exists an open set $U$ containing $x$ , such that $f(U)$ is a submanifold with dimension of $Y$ , $f|_{U}:U\to Y$ is an embedding and $f(U)$ is open in $f(X)$ .

I have found the discussion of compactness in Escardó's papers very hard to follow, with many forward references.  The nearest thing to a proof that I can identify is in section 8 of his notes on "" synthetic topology of data types "". The proof in chapter 8 is very advanced.  In these notes compactness is initially defined to be exhaustibility, which doesn't make it easier to follow what is going on. My question is: I keep hoping for an elementary proof, one which relates the conventional definition of compactness, in terms of open covers, to exhaustibility. I have not been able to find one myself and I have not been able to extract one from Escardó's papers.  Is there such a proof?",,"['general-topology', 'compactness', 'computer-science', 'type-theory']"

Munkres, 2nd edition: Let $X$ be a compact Hausdorff space; let $\left\{  A_n  \right\}$ be a countable collection of closed sets of $X$ . If each set $A_n$ has empty interior in $X$ , then the union $\bigcup  A_n$ has empty interior in $X$ . How to show this fact? What if we have an uncountable collection of closed sets, each set having empty interior? Does the conclusion still hold? My effort: First a preliminary result: Let $X$ be a compact Hausdorff space, and let $A$ be a closed subset of $X$ . If $U$ is a non-empty open set in $X$ such that $U \not\subset A$ , then there is a non-empty open set $V$ in $X$ such that $\overline{V} \subset U-A$ , that is, $\overline{V} \subset U$ and $\overline{V} \cap A = \emptyset$ . Am I right? Proof: Since $U \not\subset A$ , the set $U - A$ is non-empty. Let $x \in U-A$ . Let us put $$ B \colon= A \cup (X-U). \tag{Definition 0} $$ Then $B$ is closed in $X$ , and also $x \not\in B$ . Now since $X$ is compact and since $B$ is closed in $X$ , therefore $B$ is also compact (as a subspace of $X$ ), by virtue of Theorem 26.2 in Munkres. Since $X$ is a Hausdorff space, since $x \in X$ , and since $B$ is a compact subspace of $X$ such that $x \not\in B$ , therefore by Lemma 26.4 in Munkres there are open sets $V$ and $W$ in $X$ such that $$ x \in V, \qquad B \subset W, \qquad \mbox{ and } \qquad V \cap W = \emptyset. \tag{1} $$ Therefore we have $$ \begin{align} X- W &\subset X-B \qquad \mbox{ [because $B \subset W \subset X$] } \\ &= X - \big( A \cup (X-U) \big) \qquad \mbox{ [by (Definition 0) above ] } \\ &= (X-A)\cap \big( X-(X-U) \big) \qquad \mbox{ [a DeMorgan's law] } \\ &= (X-A) \cap U \\  & \qquad \mbox{ [the compelement of the complement set $U\subset X$ equals $U$ itself] }\\ &= U-A \qquad \mbox{ [a set-theoretic identity] }, \end{align} $$ that is, $$ X-W \subset U-A; \tag{2} $$ and also from (1) we have $$ V \subset X-W.  $$ Moreover, since $X-W$ is closed in $X$ and since $V \subset X - W$ , therefore we can also conclude that $$ \overline{V} \subset X-W. \tag{3} $$ Thus from (1), (2), and (3) above we obtain $$ x \in V \subset \overline{V} \subset X-W \subset U-A. $$ That is, $V$ is a non-empty open set in $X$ and $\overline{V} \subset U-A$ ,    as required. Is this proof correct? Now for the main proof: Let us put $$ A \colon= \bigcup A_n . \tag{A} $$ We show that $A$ has empty interior. For this, we show that there is no non-empty open set $U$ in $X$ such that $U \subset A$ . Let $U$ be any non-empty open set in $X$ . Let us put $$V_0 \colon= U. \tag{0} $$ This is just for notational convenience. Then since $A_1$ has empty interior in $X$ and since $V_0$ is a non-empty open set in $X$ , therefore the set $V_0$ is not contained in $A_1$ . So there exists a non-empty open set $V_1$ in $X$ such that $$\overline{V_1} \subset V_0 -A_1. \tag{1} $$ Again as the set $A_2$ has empty interior in $X$ and as $V_1$ is a non-empty open set in $X$ , so the set $V_1 \not\subset A_2$ , and thus there exists a non-empty open set $V_2$ in $X$ such that $$ \overline{V_2} \subset V_1 - A_2. \tag{2} $$ Now suppose that the non-empty open sets $V_1, \ldots,  V_{n-1}$ (for $ n= 3, 4, 5, \ldots$ ) have been chosen such that $$ \overline{V_k} \subset V_{k-1} - A_k \ \mbox{ for each } \ k = 1, 2, \ldots, n-1. \tag{3} $$ Now as the set $A_n$ has empty interior in $X$ and as the set $V_{n-1}$ is a non-empty open set in $X$ , so $V_{n-1} \not\subset A_n$ , which implies that there exists a non-empty open set $V_n$ in $X$ such that $$ \overline{V_n} \subset V_{n-1} - A_n. \tag{4} $$ From (1) we note that $$ \overline{V_1} \subset V_0 \subset \overline{V_0} \qquad \mbox{ and also } \qquad \overline{V_1} \cap A_1 = \emptyset. $$ From (2) we find that $$ \overline{V_2} \subset V_1 \subset \overline{V_1} \qquad \mbox{ and also } \qquad \overline{V_2} \cap A_2 = \emptyset. $$ And so on, from (4) we find that $$ \overline{V_n} \subset V_{n-1} \subset \overline{V_{n-1}} \qquad \mbox{ and also } \qquad \overline{V_n} \cap A_n = \emptyset $$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n > 1$ . Thus we have a sequence $$ \overline{V_0}, \overline{V_1}, \overline{V_2}, \overline{V_3}, \ldots $$ of non-empty closed sets in $X$ such that, for each $n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$ , we have $$ \overline{V_n} \subset \overline{V_{n-1}} \qquad \mbox{ and } \qquad \overline{V_n} \cap A_n = \emptyset. \tag{5} $$ In particular, $\overline{V_1} \subset U$ , by virtue of (1) and (0) above. And, if $\overline{V_{n_1}}, \ldots, \overline{V_{n_k}}$ are any finitely many of these sets, then we have $$ \bigcap_{i=1}^k \overline{V_{n_i}} = \overline{V_{n_0}} ,$$ where $$ n_0 \colon= \max\left\{ n_1, \ldots, n_k \right\}, $$ and so $\bigcap_{i=1}^k \overline{V_{n_i}}$ is non-empty. Thus the nested sequence $\left( \overline{V_n} \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of non-empty closed sets of $X$ has the finite intersection property, and as $X$ is compact, so by Theorem 26.9 in Munkres these sets have a non-empty intersection. That is, $$ \bigcap  \overline{V_n} \neq \emptyset. $$ Suppose $x \in \bigcap \overline{V_n}$ . Then $x$ is in each set $\overline{V_n}$ , which implies that $x \in U$ and also that $x$ is not in any set $A_n$ , and so $x \not\in A$ , refer to Def. (A) above. Thus $x \in U - A$ and therefore $U \not\subset A$ . But $U$ was any arbitrarily chosen non-empty open set in $X$ . Hence $A = \bigcup A_n$ has empty interior. Is my proof correct?

At some point in an introductory work on analysis, the author will define the meaning of the expression ""the topological space associated with (or induced by) a metric space."" I'd like to know if this definition is in some sense ""the unique correct definition,"" or whether it is only ""one of many possible."" EDIT: Lets put this another way. Obviously there are many function $\mathsf{Met} \rightarrow \mathsf{Top}$, but most of them are pretty boring. So we can restrict ourselves to functors, where $\mathsf{Met}$ and $\mathsf{Top}$ are viewed as categories (technically we need to make also specify what the morphisms of $\mathsf{Met}$ should be.) Anyway, as Martin points out, we're still going to be left with lots of ""boring"" functors. So I guess the question is, how do we get rid of all the ""boring"" ones? And once we do, is the canonical functor the only one that's left? Obviously I haven't defined ""boring"" so this is a very soft question. Magma suggests the following refinement of the question: does the canonical functor satisfy suitable a universal mapping property? Here's another angle. Suppose we run into an alien species, which studies topological spaces (and calls them topotopos, and what we would call ""an open set of a toplogical space"" they call ""an openopen of a topotopo""). They also study metric spaces (and call them metrometros.) We send that species a message asking them about the ""the openopens of a metrometro."" Will their notion of open set of a metric space coincide with our notion? And if so, why?",,"['general-topology', 'soft-question', 'category-theory', 'metric-spaces']"

86,Fundamental group of two tori with a circle ($S^1✕${$x_0$}) identified,Fundamental group of two tori with a circle ({}) identified,S^1✕ x_0,"Compute the fundamental group of the space obtained from two tori $S^1✕S^1$ by identifying a circle $S^1✕$ { $x_0$ } in one torus with the corresponding circle $S^1✕$ { $x_0$ } in the other. Using van Kampen's theorem, I can fairly quickly show that if $T_1$ is one torus and $T_2$ is the other, then the group has to be isomorphic to $((π_1(T_1) ∗ π_1(T_2)))/N ≅ (\mathbb{Z} ✕ \mathbb{Z})∗ (\mathbb{Z} ✕ \mathbb{Z})/N$ , where N is generated by elements of the form $i_{12}(w)i_{21}(w)^{-1}$ , w is in $\pi_1(S^1✕$ { $x_0$ } $) ≅ \mathbb{Z}$ and $i_{12}$ , $i_{21}$ are the maps from $\pi_1(S^1✕$ { $x_0$ } $)$ to $π_1(T_1)$ , $π_1(T_2)$ respectively determined by inclusion. My problem is, as it seems to always be with van Kampen-related problems, figuring out what the elements of N look like. My attempt to do this in a pure-algebra way, as far as I can tell, failed me: I tried examining the case where w represents a loop that goes n (some integer) times around the circle, but then it seems like $i_{12}(w)$ "" $=$ "" $(n, 0)$ in $T_1$ and $i_{21}(w)$ "" $=$ "" $(n, 0)$ in $T_2$ , which says to me that $i_{12}(w)i_{21}(w)^{-1} $ "" $=$ "" $ (n, 0) + (-n, 0) = 0$ . The notation here isn't right, since $(n, 0)$ in $T_1$ is not the same as $(n, 0)$ in $T_2$ and their addition (composition?) shouldn't be written quite that way, hence my quotes around the equals signs, but certainly no loop in $S^1✕$ { $x_0$ } is going to magically include anything but the 0 loop in either torus's second component, right? But this doesn't seem right to me, since if a, b are the generators of the circles in $T_1$ and d, e are the generators of the circles in $T_2$ , and c is the constant path then the identification of the circle should make, say, $a = d$ , so for example $(a, b)*(d, e)$ $ = (a^2,b)*(c, e)$ $ = (c, b)*(d^2,e)$ . This doesn't match with what I just worked out N might be, but I also can't figure out what N should look like to make this equivalence make sense.

This means we can always pick some $x_0 \in X$ such that $d(f_n(x_0), f(x_0)) \geq \varepsilon$. By the triangle inequality, we have that $\forall x \in X$ $$ d(f_n(x_0), f(x_0)) \leq d(f_n(x_0), f_n(x)) + d(f_n(x), f(x)) + d(f(x), f(x_0)) $$ As $f_n$ and $f$ are continuous, then we can pick $x$ in a neighbourhood such that the first and third term are less than any $\varepsilon > 0$.

99,$\mathbb{R}^3 \setminus A$ deformation retracts onto $S^1 \vee S^2$,deformation retracts onto,\mathbb{R}^3 \setminus A S^1 \vee S^2,"Hatcher says the following: The complement $\mathbb{R}^3 \setminus A$ of a single circle $A$ deformation retracts onto a wedge sum $S^1 \vee S^2$ . He then goes on to explain it, but I do not understand the explainations (pages 46/47, example 1.23). I'm staring at the following picture: The first is $S^1 \vee S^2$ and the second is homotopy equivalent to the first. So the question is, why is the second space homotopy equivalent to $\mathbb{R}^3 \setminus A$ ? Hatcher says, we push points from outside the sphere onto the sphere. So far, so good. Points that are outside of $A$ can also be pushed onto the sphere. What about points inside $A$ ? Can we contract them to a point and stretch it from one end of the sphere to the other to get the desired space?","Hatcher says the following: The complement of a single circle deformation retracts onto a wedge sum .
