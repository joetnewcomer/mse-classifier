It's obvious that the sequence isn't monotonic, hence I had to stick with a Cauchy theorem. But it led me nowhere: $|x_{n+p}-x_{n}| < | \frac {n \cdot x_{n-1}} {n + 1} + 2 \cdot \sum_{i=n}^{2n-2} x_i + { \frac {x_{2n-1}} {2n} } |$ (I got there under the assumption that $n = p$.) Then I tried another move: $x_{n+1} - x_{n} = \frac {x_n + n \cdot x_{n-1}} {n+1} - x_n = $ $= \frac {-n \cdot ( x_n - x_{n-1})} {n+1}$ $x_{n} - x_{n-1} = \frac {(1-n) \cdot (x_{n-1} - x_{n-2})} {n}$ It looks like progress, but I still don't know how to go next.",,"['sequences-and-series', 'limits', 'cauchy-sequences']"

39,"There is a fox that hides in an infinite row of bushes (indexed by $\mathbb{N}$), give a strategy to eventually catch the fox.","There is a fox that hides in an infinite row of bushes (indexed by ), give a strategy to eventually catch the fox.",\mathbb{N},"Recently, one of my professors gave a riddle to my class. He got it while studying abroad some years ago. It goes like this, Before you is an infinite row of bushes (indexed by $\mathbb{N}$ ). A fox is in one of the bushes, but you do not know which. Each time you look at a bush, if the fox is not there, it jumps ahead a fixed but unknown number of bushes. Give a strategy to eventually capture the fox (in a finite, but potentially large number of attempts). Let $a \in \mathbb{N}$ be the initial position of the fox and let $b \in \mathbb{N}$ be the unknown jump size. If $(s_n)$ is our sequence of guesses (i.e. $s_4 = 8$ means our fourth guess is the $8$ th bush) and $(t_n) = a + b \cdot (n - 1)$ is the sequence of the fox's location, then we are looking to find $(s_n)$ so that there exists an $n \in \mathbb{N}$ where $s_n = t_n$ . Here are my thoughts so far: (1) Because the number of bushes the fox jumps is constant and unknown, our strategy must involve guesses that grow farther apart over time. Say we start with the first bush and cycle through every bush after it, then if $b > 1$ or $a > 1$ , we will never catch the fox. (2) Because our strategy will involve guesses that are increasingly farther apart if we pass the fox at any point, we will not catch it. Thus, it also makes sense to start our guessing with 1. (3) I considered $(s_n)$ = the $n$ th prime. If there is some property that relates $(t_n)$ to prime numbers, maybe this could be useful. I do not know much about primes, so I did not get very far with this strategy. (4) I made some progress using Fibonacci numbers. If $(s_n) =$ { $1,1,2,3,5,8,13,\dots$ }, then it would suffice to show that on the $n$ th guess, the fox cannot be in the interval $(s_{n-1},s_n)$ . The first number that does not appear is 4. Thus, the fox would not be caught if $t_5 = 4$ . This is not possible because the only $a,b$ that satisfy this are $a = 1$ and $b = 1$ , but if $a=1$ we catch the fox on the first guess. The next possible set of bushes in which the fox would not be caught is {6,7}. This would be $t_6 = 6$ or $t_6 = 7$ . Once again, the only $a,b$ that satisfy this are $a = 1$ and $b = 1$ . This appears to work for the first couple of cases, but this strategy breaks down pretty soon. Notice, if $t_7 = 10$ , then with $a = 4$ and $b = 1$ , the fox is not caught. Even if this strategy did work, I am not sure how to generalize to an arbitrary guess. (5) I have previously asked a question related to this here in which I asked the question strictly in terms of sequences and recieved an answer. I am not sure how the answer applies to the question of the fox and the bushes or if that answer even works.","Recently, one of my professors gave a riddle to my class. He got it while studying abroad some years ago. It goes like this, Before you is an infinite row of bushes (indexed by ). A fox is in one of the bushes, but you do not know which. Each time you look at a bush, if the fox is not there, it jumps ahead a fixed but unknown number of bushes. Give a strategy to eventually capture the fox (in a finite, but potentially large number of attempts). Let be the initial position of the fox and let be the unknown jump size. If is our sequence of guesses (i.e. means our fourth guess is the th bush) and is the sequence of the fox's location, then we are looking to find so that there exists an where . Here are my thoughts so far: (1) Because the number of bushes the fox jumps is constant and unknown, our strategy must involve guesses that grow farther apart over time. Say we start with the first bush and cycle through every bush after it, then if or , we will never catch the fox. (2) Because our strategy will involve guesses that are increasingly farther apart if we pass the fox at any point, we will not catch it. Thus, it also makes sense to start our guessing with 1. (3) I considered = the th prime. If there is some property that relates to prime numbers, maybe this could be useful. I do not know much about primes, so I did not get very far with this strategy. (4) I made some progress using Fibonacci numbers. If { }, then it would suffice to show that on the th guess, the fox cannot be in the interval . The first number that does not appear is 4. Thus, the fox would not be caught if . This is not possible because the only that satisfy this are and , but if we catch the fox on the first guess. The next possible set of bushes in which the fox would not be caught is {6,7}. This would be or . Once again, the only that satisfy this are and . This appears to work for the first couple of cases, but this strategy breaks down pretty soon. Notice, if , then with and , the fox is not caught. Even if this strategy did work, I am not sure how to generalize to an arbitrary guess.

Why would you want an infinite expansion for a series that works for such few values (only between $-1$ and $1$)? It just kind of seems like it isn't very flexible. However, I have a feeling there is some glaring error in my logic that will make me look silly.","Okay, I am beginning to get how Maclaurin series work, but what I don't understand is why they are useful.
