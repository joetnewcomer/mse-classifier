4,What is going on in this degree 8 number field that fails to be a quaternion extension of $\mathbb{Q}$?,What is going on in this degree 8 number field that fails to be a quaternion extension of ?,\mathbb{Q},"This is a soft but very mathematically hands-on question. Hopefully it will be interesting to more than just me. Thanks in advance for your help in thinking clearly about what follows. I have been trying to build a quaternion extension of $\mathbb{Q}$. I have been pursuing an overly optimistic method, which has not quite been working, and I just learned from this MO question that it's impossible for it to work. I would like your help in thinking about the way it is failing; more precisely, the extent to which it is/is not working. I have obtained a family of degree 8 number fields that are not quaternion extensions, and are not even normal, but due to the construction there is (perhaps??) something quaternion-ish about them. I guess my question is really: what is the relationship of $Q_8$ to the galois group of their normal closure? Let $L=\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ be a $Q_8$-extension of $\mathbb{Q}$. $L$ has a unique biquadratic subfield $K=\mathbb{Q}(\theta,\psi)$ where $\theta^2,\psi^2\in\mathbb{Q}$, and thus quadratic subfields $\mathbb{Q}(\theta),\mathbb{Q}(\psi),\mathbb{Q}(\theta\psi)$ fixed by $\mathbf{i},\mathbf{j},\mathbf{k}$ respectively. From the MO question linked above I learned that $\theta^2,\psi^2>0$, but before I knew that, I reasoned as follows: $\mathbf{i}$ must fix $\theta$ and reverse the sign of $\psi$, and have order $4$ cyclic action on $\alpha$. $\alpha$ can be taken to be the square root of an element of $K$; then we must have $\mathbf{i}^2(\alpha)=-\alpha$. So, optimistically, suppose $\mathbf{i}(\alpha)= \psi/\alpha$. Then $\mathbf{i}^2(\alpha)=-\psi/(\psi/\alpha)=-\alpha$; this is promising! Suppose likewise that $\mathbf{j}(\alpha)=\theta/\alpha$. Then $\mathbf{k}(\alpha)=\mathbf{ij}(\alpha)=\theta/(\psi/\alpha)=(\theta/\psi)\alpha$, and $$\mathbf{k}^2(\alpha) = \left(\frac{-\theta}{-\psi}\right)\left(\frac{\theta}{\psi}\right)\alpha=-\alpha$$ Thus $\theta^2,\psi^2$ are equal magnitude and opposite sign. This tells us, a propos of the linked MO question, that this optimistic construction cannot actually work. However, bear with me: If all of this were actually working, we would have $\theta/\psi = i$ (up to sign), and thus the conjugates of $\alpha$ would be $$\pm \alpha, \pm i\alpha, \pm \psi/\alpha, \pm i\psi/\alpha$$ A straightforward calculation shows that any polynomial of the form $$f_{\psi^2}(x) = x^8 - 2r x^4 + \psi^4$$ with $r,\psi^2\in\mathbb{Q}$ has these as roots. If we choose $r,\psi^2$ so that $f$ is irreducible, then $\mathbb{Q}[x]/(f)$ is a field of degree 8 over $\mathbb{Q}$, so even if it is not the originally-desired quaternion extension of $\mathbb{Q}$, it is something with a kind of promising-looking bunch of roots. So, consider $L=\mathbb{Q}[x]/(f)$ and let $\alpha$ be the residue of $x$ in this field.  If it were really the desired extension, it would contain $i, \psi$. We can force it to contain either one of these because we have control over the discriminant of $\alpha^4$ since we can control $r,\psi^2$. For example, choosing them so that $r^2+1=\psi^4$, e.g. $r=4/3, \psi^2=5/3$, we get $$\left(\alpha^4-r\right)^2 = (2r\alpha^4-\psi^4) -2r\alpha^4 + r^2 = r^2-\psi^4= -1$$ so that $L\supset \mathbb{Q}(i)$; in fact, $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha^4)=\mathbb{Q}(i)$ because it contains it and is degree $2$. Before I realized that $L$ couldn't possibly be my desired quaternion extension, I was hoping I could put a further fullfillable constraint on $r,\psi^2$ to force it to contain $\psi$; this was of course in vain. However, the search did lead me to realize that $$\left[\alpha^2((\psi^2-2r)+\alpha^4)\right]^2=\alpha^4\left(-4r(\psi^2-r)+2(\psi^2-r)\alpha^4\right)$$ $$=2(\psi^2-r)\left(-2r\alpha^4+\alpha^8\right)=2(r-\psi^2)\psi^4$$ Thus (because $\psi^4$ is a rational square) $L$, in fact $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha^2)$, contains a square root of $2(r-\psi^2)$. I found this square root by searching for elements of $L$ that were invariant under the substitution $\alpha\mapsto i\psi/\alpha$, which I wanted to correspond to $\mathbf{j}$. I was hoping for $\psi$ but instead I got a different rational square root! At any rate, we conclude that $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha^2)\subset L$ contains both $i$ and $\sqrt{2(r-\psi^2)}$. (For example with $r=4/3, \psi^2=5/3$, it contains $\sqrt{-2/3}$, thus $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6})$.) Thus (under the condition $r^2+1=\phi^4$), $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha^2)$ is generically a biquadratic extension of $\mathbb{Q}$, and thus normal. On the other hand, $L$ is not normal, because it can't contain $\psi$ unless it is generated over $\mathbb{Q}$ by $i$, $\psi$, and $\sqrt{2(r-\psi^2)}$, and this is not plausible. On the other hand, $f$ splits in $L(\psi)$, so $L$'s normal closure is a quadratic extension of it. $L$ ought to have one conjugate $L'=\mathbb{Q}(\psi/\alpha)$ corresponding to the fact that $\alpha$ and $\psi/\alpha$ are both roots of $f$ and all other roots of $f$ are obtained from these by multiplying by $i$, which $L$ and thus any conjugate contains. So, we've obained a normal degree 16 extension $L(\psi)$ of $\mathbb{Q}$. I guess my question amounts to, what's the relationship between its Galois group and $Q_8$? (It seems to me that, at least, $Q_8$ should be a subgroup, with $\mathbf{i}$ sending $\psi\mapsto -\psi$, $\alpha\mapsto \psi/\alpha$, and $\mathbf{j}$ fixing $\psi$ and sending $\alpha\mapsto i\psi/\alpha$.

6,A Conjecture about Maximal Prime Gaps,A Conjecture about Maximal Prime Gaps,,"As it is well known that prime number is $2,3,5\cdots \cdots$, thus all these prime number are denoted by$p_{1},p_{2},\cdots \cdots ,p_{n}\cdots \cdots$. The prime maximal gap $\max_{p_{n+1}\leqslant N}(p_{n+1}-p_{n})$ means the maximum value of $ (p_{2}-p_{1},p_{3}-p_{2},\cdots \cdots ,p_{n+1}-p_{n})$. In 1937, Cramér gave a conjecture about the prime maximal gaps that $$\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty }\sup\frac{p_{n+1}-p_{n}}{(\log p_{n})^{2}}=1$$which is still an unproven conjecture. I found a conjecture about the prime maximal gaps that $$\max_{p_{n+1}\leqslant N }(p_{n+1}-p_{n})\approx \log N(\log N-2\log\log N)+2$$ when $N\geqslant 7$. My conjecture gives an approximate value of the prime maximal gap ,which is close to the actual value. question: Has anyone a clue how to prove or disprove the above conjecture? \begin{matrix}   A& B & C & D & E & F & G\\\   1&2&1&——&	——&	——&	——\\\ 2 &	3 &	2 &	—— &	—— &	—— &	——\\\ 3	 &7	 &4 &	3 &	0.75 &	4 &	1.00\\\ 4 &	23 &	6 &	5 &	0.83 &	10 &	1.67\\\ 5&	89&	8&	9&	1.13&	20&	2.50\\\ 6&	113&	14&	10&	0.71&	22&	1.57\\\ 7&	523&	18&	18&	1.00&	39&	2.17\\\ 8&	887&	20&	22&	1.10&	46&	2.30\\\ 9&	1129&	22&	24&	1.09&	49&	2.23\\\ 10&	1327&	34&	25&	0.74&	52&	1.53\\\ 11&	9551&	36&	45&	1.25&	84&	2.33\\\ 12&	15683&	44&	51&	1.16&	93&	2.11\\\ 13&	19609&	52&	54&	1.04&	98&	1.88\\\ 14&	31397&	72&	61&	0.85&	107&	1.49\\\ 15&	155921&	86&	86&	1.00&	143&	1.66\\\ 16&	360653&	96&	100&	1.04&	164&	1.71\\\ 17&	370261&	112&	101&	0.90&	164&	1.46\\\ 18&	492113&	114&	106&	0.93&	172&	1.51\\\ 19&	1349533&	118&	127&	1.08&	199&	1.69\\\ 20&	1357201&	132&	127&	0.96&	199&	1.51\\\ 21&	2010733&	148&	135&	0.91&	211&	1.43\\\ 22&	4652353&	154&	154&	1.00&	236&	1.53\\\ 23&	17051707&	180&	186&	1.03&	277&	1.54\\\ 24&	20831323&	210&	191&	0.91&	284&	1.35\\\ 25&	47326693&	220&	213&	0.97&	312&	1.42\\\ 26&	122164747&	222&	240&	1.08&	347&	1.56\\\ 27&	189695659&	234&	253&	1.08&	363&	1.55\\\ 28&	191912783&	248&	253&	1.02&	364&	1.47\\\ 29&	387096133&	250&	275&	1.10&	391&	1.56\\\ 30&	436273009&	282&	279&	0.99&	396&	1.40\\\ 31&	1294268491	&288&	314&	1.09&	440&	1.53\\\ 32&	1453168141&	292&	318&	1.09&	445&	1.52\\\ 33&	2300942549&	320&	334&	1.04&	465&	1.45\\\ 34&	3842610773	&336&	352&	1.05&	487&	1.45\\\ 35&	4302407359&	354&	357&	1.01&	492&	1.39\\\ 36&	10726904659&	382&	390&	1.02&	533&	1.40\\\ 37&	20678048297&	384&	416&	1.08&	564&	1.47\\\ 38&	22367084959&	394&	419&	1.06&	568&	1.44\\\ 39&	25056082087&	456&	423&	0.93&	573&	1.26\\\ 40&	42652618343&	464&	445&	0.96&	599&	1.29\\\ 41&	127976334671&	468&	490&	1.05&	654&	1.40\\\ 42&	182226896239&	474&	505&	1.07&	672&	1.42\\\ 43&	241160624143&	486&	518&	1.07&	687&	1.41\\\ 44&	297501075799&	490&	527&	1.08&	698&	1.42\\\ 45&	303371455241&	500&	528&	1.06&	699&	1.40\\\ 46&	304599508537&	514&	528&	1.03&	699&	1.36\\\ 47&	416608695821&	516&	542&	1.05&	716&	1.39\\\ 48&	461690510011&	532&	547&	1.03&	721&	1.36\\\ 49&	614487453523&	534&	560&	1.05&	737&	1.38\\\ 50&	738832927927&	540&	568&	1.05&	747&	1.38\\\ 51&	1346294310749&	582&	596&	1.02&	780&	1.34\\\ 52&	1408695493609&	588&	598&	1.02&	783&	1.33\\\ 53&	1968188556461&	602&	614&	1.02&	801&	1.33\\\ 54&	2614941710599&	652&	628&	0.96&	818&	1.25\\\ 55&	7177162611713&	674&	678&	1.01&	876&	1.30\\\ 56&	13829048559701&	716&	711&	0.99&	916&	1.28\\\ 57&	19581334192423&	766&	729&	0.95&	937&	1.22\\\ 58&	42842283925351&	778&	771&	0.99&	985&	1.27\\\ 59&	90874329411493&	804&	812&	1.01&	1033&	1.28\\\ 60&	171231342420521&	806&	847&	1.05&	1074&	1.33\\\ 61&	218209405436543&	906&	861&	0.95&	1090&	1.20\\\ 62&	1189459969825483&	916&	961&	1.05&	1205&	1.32\\\ 63&	1686994940955803&	924&	982&	1.06&	1229&	1.33\\\ 64&	1693182318746371&	1132&	982&	0.87&	1230&	1.09\\\ 65&	43841547845541059&	1184&	1191&	1.01&	1468&	1.24\\\ 66&	55350776431903243&	1198&	1207&	1.01&	1486&	1.24\\\ 67&	80873624627234849&	1220&	1233&	1.01&	1516&	1.24\\\ 68&	203986478517455989&	1224&	1297&	1.06&	1589&	1.30\\\ 69&	218034721194214273&	1248&	1301&	1.04&	1594&	1.28\\\ 70&	305405826521087869&	1272&	1325&	1.04&	1621&	1.27\\\ 71&	352521223451364323&	1328&	1336&	1.01&	1632&	1.23\\\ 72&	401429925999153707&	1356&	1345&	0.99&	1643&	1.21\\\ 73&	418032645936712127&	1370&	1348&	0.98&	1646&	1.20\\\ 74&	804212830686677669&	1442&	1395&	0.97&	1700&	1.18\\\ 75&	1425172824437699411&	1476&	1437&	0.97&	1747&	1.18 \end{matrix} A:Serial number, B:Natural number, C:$\max_{p_{n+1}\leqslant N}(p_{n+1}-p_{n})$, D:$\log N(\log N-2\log\log N)+2$, E:$\frac{\log N(\log N-2\log\log N)+2}{\max_{p_{n+1}\leqslant N}(p_{n+1}-p_{n})}$, F:$ (\log N)^{2}$, G:$\frac{(\log N)^{2}}{\max_{p_{n+1}\leqslant N}(p_{n+1}-p_{n})}$","As it is well known that prime number is $2,3,5\cdots \cdots$, thus all these prime number are denoted by$p_{1},p_{2},\cdots \cdots ,p_{n}\cdots \cdots$.

10,Solving $n!=p^r-p$ with $p$ prime,Solving  with  prime,n!=p^r-p p,"A while ago, I was told of this exercise in Pollack's book, "" Not always buried deep ."" I think it is exercise 3 in chapter 1, but I do not own a copy of the book, so I cannot give more precise references. I have heard from different people that the exercise is harder than intended, and the reference given in the book does not quite prove the statement. I was hoping somebody knew of a reference, or sees how to solve it. The question is to show the following. (I think this is then applied to show some estimates on the number of primes in an interval, but this is the part I am interested in.) If $n\ge 6$ and $2\le k\le n$, then $\frac{n!}k+1$ has a prime factor larger than $n$. Towards a contradiction, suppose that this is not the case. If $p$ is a prime factor of $(n!/k)+1$, then we are assuming that $p\le n$ and since $p\mid n!+k$, then $p\mid k$. In fact, $p=k$, or else $p$ appears in the factorization of $n!/k$. So we are saying that $(n!/p)+1$ is a power of $p$, and we are led to the equation $$ n! = p^r-p $$ from the title. Conversely, any solution to this equation leads to a pair $(n,k)$ contradicting the statement of the question, except for the fact that perhaps $n<6$. Now, the above is on the trivial side of things but unfortunately I do not see how to continue. (We have that $n<2p$. Perhaps Stirling can be somehow used to bound the size of $r$?)

Let $\sigma$ generate $\text{gal}(f / \mathbb{Q})$ Look at the vectors $v_i = \alpha_0 + \zeta^i \alpha_1 + \zeta^{2i} \alpha_2 + \ldots + \zeta^{(n-1)i} \alpha_{n-1}$ .

The set of algebraic integers in the quadratic field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{m})$ is $$ \left\{ a + b \sqrt{m} : a,b \in \mathbb{Z} \right\} $$ if $m \equiv 2,3 \pmod{4}$; and$$ \left\{ \frac{a+b\sqrt{m}}{2} : a,b \in \mathbb{Z} ~,~ a \equiv b \pmod{2} \right\}$$ when $m \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$. $\square$ It is easy enough to see that the claimed sets do, indeed, consist of algebraic integers. The other half of the proof proceeds something like this: suppose that $\alpha = r + s \sqrt{m}$ is an element of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{m})$.

Thank you very much!","I'm currently reading Marcus' ""Number Fields,"" and I'm having difficulty proving the following result: Corollary 2.2: Let $m$ be a squarefree integer. The set of algebraic integers in the quadratic field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{m})$ is $$ \left\{ a + b \sqrt{m} : a,b \in \mathbb{Z} \right\} $$ if $m \equiv 2,3 \pmod{4}$; and$$ \left\{ \frac{a+b\sqrt{m}}{2} : a,b \in \mathbb{Z} ~,~ a \equiv b \pmod{2} \right\}$$ when $m \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$. $\square$ It is easy enough to see that the claimed sets do, indeed, consist of algebraic integers.

A quasi-character $c$ of the multiplication group $k^\times$ is a continuous homomorphism into $\mathbb{C}$. Since $k^\times = U\times P$, where $U$ is the unit group of $\mathbb{Z}_p$, and $P$ is the cyclic group generated multiplicatively by $p$ (thus $P\cong \mathbb{Z}$), $c$ can be written as $c(a)=\chi(a)|a|^s$, where $\chi$ is the character of $k^\times$ obtained by projecting to $U$ and then applying $c$'s restriction to $U$, and $s$ is the complex number determined (up to a multiple of $2\pi i/\log p$) by the equation $c(p)=1/p^s$. Let $\lambda:k\rightarrow \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$ be defined by reducing a $p$-adic number modulo $\mathbb{Z}_p$ and embedding the resulting sum of powers of $p^{-1}$ in $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$, and define the Fourier transform of an $L^1$ function $k\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ by $$\hat f(y) = \int_k f(x)e^{-2\pi i\lambda(xy)}d\mu(x)$$ Now, for a given quasi-character $c$, define $\hat c$ by $\hat c(a) = |a|[c(a)]^{-1}$ for $a\in k^\times$. Finally, define a ""local zeta-function"" that takes as parameters a function $f:k\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ that is sufficiently integrable, and a quasi-character $c$ of $k^\times$, as follows: $$\zeta(f,c) = \int_{k^\times} f(a)c(a)|a|^{-1}d\mu(a)$$ (The $|a|^{-1}d\mu(a)$ is the Haar measure on $k^\times$.)

This equation is eventually going to be used to prove the classical functional equation of the classical $\zeta$-functions. It is kind of a miraculous formula: it implies that the ratio $\zeta(f,c)/\zeta(\hat f,\hat c)$ is independent of the function $f$ and is actually just a function of $c$. Lang calls it $\rho(c)$. I follow the proof step-by-step but I am missing the forest for the trees. So my question is this: What is the ratio $\rho(c)=\zeta(f,c)/\zeta(\hat f,\hat c)$? What is it telling us about the quasi-character $c$? Why, morally, is it independent of $f$? Apologies that this question is not more precise. An example of a more precise question whose answer would advance my understanding of what I am going for here is Writing $c(a)=\chi(a)|a|^s$ for a character $\chi$ of $k^\times$ and fixing the character $\chi$ and the field $k=\mathbb{Q}_p$, $\rho$ becomes a complex function of a complex number.

By reduction it turns out that for odd primes $p$ which are congruent to one of $1,9,15,23,25,39\,(\!\!\bmod\,56)$ there are two proper equivalence classes of forms represented by the reduced forms $x^2+14y^2$ and $2x^2+7y^2$ . I haven't read genus theory much but I know that these two forms are in same genus. My question is that is it possible that a same prime $p$ congruent to one of the above residues can be represented by both the forms $x^2+14y^2$ and $2x^2+7y^2$ . In other words is there a way to separate the primes of the given residues which are represented by these two forms etc. Can I say that a prime $p$ congruent to the above residues can be represented by precisely one of the above two forms but not by both??? Is it possible to come to a conclusion with only reduction theory (this is upto what I have studied till now)??? For the case $D=-20$ , however the reduced forms $x^2+5y^2$ and $2x^2\pm 2xy+3y^2$ represent different primes which can easily be seen by examining the resudues  mod 20 which are coprime to 20, which happen to be disjoint for the two forms. But unfortunately this fails for $D=-56$ and the forms in question, as the residues mod 56 for $x^2+14y^2$ and $2x^2+7y^2$ are identical i.e $1,9,15,23,25,39\,(\!\!\bmod\,56)$ .

Find all integer $z$ for which there exist a polynomial $P$ that $P(z)$ is not an integer. Note that we don't refer to $P(1)$ . my question : Is there any rules for $z$ ? example : $N=1$ If 2nd degree polynomial $P(x)$ holds that $P(0)$ and $P(2)$ are integers, then we can say that $P(2k)$ is an integer for all integers $k$ , but it is not always true that $P(2k+1)$ is an integer.(e.g. $P(x)=x/2$ ) So the all $z$ that we are searching for are all integers $z$ which hold $z\equiv 1 \pmod 2$ . my attempt We have some propositions which might help. If a polynomial of degree $N$ with rational coefficients takes integer values on $0,1,2,\ldots,N$ , then it takes integer values on any integer points. Let $k\in\mathbb{Z}$ . If a integer-valued polynomial of degree $N$ is divisible by $k$ on $0,1,2,\ldots,N$ , it is divisible by $k$ in any integer point. Let $q$ is a prime number. If a integer-valued polynomial of degree $q-1$ is not divisible by $q$ on all points of $0,1,2,\ldots,q-1$ , it is not divisible by $q$ on any integer. We can generalize them for the points on $k,k+l,k+2l,k+3l\ldots$ (where $k,l\in\mathbb{Z})$ . And I have a conjecture. If $P(0),P(2),P(3),\cdots,P(N+1)\equiv0\pmod{N+1}$ , then $P$ takes integer values on all integer points. in other words, For any denominator of the value of polynomial $P$ on integer point, it is a divisor of $N+1$ . I think that this is why $P(x)$ have some relations to the factor of $N+1$ . attempt on PC: I tested some (about hundreds each) cases. I found that $P(x)$ can be classified by when $P(x)$ becomes an integer. (see the bottom of this post) Then I found some rules. When $N+1$ is prime: If $N+1$ is a prime number, then the $z$ which we are looking for satisfy that $z\equiv 1\pmod{N+1}$ . When $N+1$ is composite: If $N+1$ can be factored into $N+1=p_1^{a_1}\cdot p_2^{a_2}\cdots {p_m}^{a_m}$ , then the $z$ are some of the $z$ which satisfy this: $$z\equiv 1,N+2,N+2+p_1,N+2+2p_1,\ldots,N+2+b_1 p_1\pmod{{p_{1}}^{\lceil log_{p_1}{N} \rceil+a_1-1}}\lor\\ z\equiv 1,N+2,N+2+p_2,N+2+2p_2,\ldots,N+2+b_2p_2\pmod{{p_{2}}^{\lceil log_{p_2}{N} \rceil+a_2-1}}\lor\\ \vdots\\ z\equiv 1,N+2,N+2+p_m,N+2+2p_m,\ldots,N+2+b_{m}p_{m}\pmod{{p_{m}}^{\lceil log_{p_m}{N}\rceil+a_m-1}}$$ where $b_k$ is the largest integer such that $n+2+b_k\cdot p_k<{p_{k}}^{\lceil log_{p_k}{N} \rceil+a_k-1}$ When $N+1=2^m$ When $N+1=2^m (m\in\mathbb{N})$ , in particular, the $z$ are most of the $z$ which satisfy that $$z\equiv 1,N+2,N+4,N+6,\ldots ,2^{2m-1}-1 \pmod{2^{2m-1}}$$

Find all integer for which there exist a polynomial that is not an integer. Note that we don't refer to . my question : Is there any rules for ? example : If 2nd degree polynomial holds that and are integers, then we can say that is an integer for all integers , but it is not always true that is an integer.(e.g. ) So the all that we are searching for are all integers which hold . my attempt We have some propositions which might help. If a polynomial of degree with rational coefficients takes integer values on , then it takes integer values on any integer points. Let . If a integer-valued polynomial of degree is divisible by on , it is divisible by in any integer point. Let is a prime number. If a integer-valued polynomial of degree is not divisible by on all points of , it is not divisible by on any integer. We can generalize them for the points on (where . And I have a conjecture. If , then takes integer values on all integer points. in other words, For any denominator of the value of polynomial on integer point, it is a divisor of . I think that this is why have some relations to the factor of . attempt on PC: I tested some (about hundreds each) cases. I found that can be classified by when becomes an integer. (see the bottom of this post) Then I found some rules. When is prime: If is a prime number, then the which we are looking for satisfy that . When is composite: If can be factored into , then the are some of the which satisfy this: where is the largest integer such that When When , in particular, the are most of the which satisfy that I

97,Totally positive unit a square?,Totally positive unit a square?,,"Let $ \mathcal{O}$ be an order in a totally real number field $E$, then $( \mathcal{O},q_1 )$ is an integral lattice with its natural  quadratic form $q_1(x):=\text{tr}_{E/\mathbb{Q}}(x^2)$ (which is positive definite). Also, if $u$ is a totally positive unit in $ \mathcal{O}$, then the form $ q_2(x):=\text{tr}_{E/\mathbb{Q}}(u \,x^2)$ give us another positive definite lattice $( \mathcal{O},q_2 )$. When $u$ is a square unit, say $u=v^2$, this lattices are actually isometric by the map $\phi:( \mathcal{O},q_1 )\rightarrow( \mathcal{O},q_2 )$ given by $x \mapsto v^{-1} x$. Now, I've been trying (for a while) to deal with the reciprocal question, i.e., If there exists an isometry $\phi:( \mathcal{O},q_1 )\rightarrow( \mathcal{O},q_2 )$, then must $u$ be a square ?. So far all I've been able to say is that if exist $\kappa \in \mathcal{O}$ such that $\phi(x)=\kappa \, x$  for all $x\in \mathcal{O} $, then $\text{tr}_{E/\mathbb{Q}}(x^2)=\text{tr}_{E/\mathbb{Q}}(u \, \kappa^2 x^2)$ implies $\text{tr}_{E/\mathbb{Q}}((1-u \, \kappa^2) x^2)=0 \,\, \forall x \in \mathcal{O} $,  but then $1-u \, \kappa^2$ would be  $q_1-$orthogonal to all $\mathcal{O}$ and therefore $u=\kappa^{-2}$, however I have no idea how to prove (or if it is even possible to prove) that $\phi$ must be of this form for some $\kappa$. I'm especially interested  in the case  where $E$ is an $S_3$ cubic field (its normal closure has Galois group $S_3$). I haven't been able to find any counterexamples in this setting, I'd be more than grateful if someone could give some idea of how to find one. I also would like to know if there are some reference where to find things related to this sort of problems. Thanks in advance!. Update: Although quadratic fields it's not my purpose I realized that there at least two $n$  for which the question is false for the quadratic field $E=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{n})$ and  maximal order $\mathcal{O}=\mathcal{O}_E$. These are $n=3,7$ with nonsquare units $u$ equal to  $2+\sqrt{3}$ and $8+3\sqrt{7}$ respectively. Indeed, the Gramm matrix of $q_i$ ($i=1,2$) always have determinant equal to $\text{disc}(\mathcal{O})$, thus $\frac{1}{2}q_i$ is a primitive form of discriminant $-4 n$ in both cases, and thefore it correspond to an ideal class in the order $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-n}]$ of conductor $2$ in $\mathcal{O_{\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-n})}}$, but since in both cases the class number $h\left(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-n}]\right)=1$, we have that $\frac{1}{2}q_1$ and $\frac{1}{2}q_2$ are equivalent and therefore $q_1$ and $q_2$  isometric. These are actually the only cases in which we can use the ""class number 1 trick"", because none the other quadratic orders of class number 1  works. Could we do something similar for cubic fields?. Edit : I made a mistake in the last update, even though the forms I mentioned do have discrimiant $-4 n$ not all of them are primitive which make the argument invalid. In fact, for this forms is true that isometry implies the unit is a squre (It's enough to note that the form asociated to the fundamental unit it's not equivalent to $2(x^2+n y^2)$ ). So, the matter is still open even for quadratic fields. Update 2: I'm going to try to focus in one case, give some examples, present some evidence and make the statement more elementary as @reuns suggest. Let's focus in the quadratic field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{n})$ with $n$ a positive square free integer  $n \equiv 3 \,\text{mod} \, 4$, and its maximal order $\mathcal{O}=\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{n}]$. Acording to A031396 all of this fields will have totally positive fundamental units (because if $a^2-n b^2=-1$  is soluble and $n$ is odd then $ n\equiv 1 \,\text{mod} \, 4$). So let $u=a+b\sqrt{n}>1$ with $a^2-n b^2=1$ be the fundamental unit, the Gramm matrix of the form we asociate to $u$ and to $1$ in the basis $\{1 , \sqrt{n} \}$ are repectively $\left[\begin{array}{cc}\text{tr}(u )  & \text{tr}(u\sqrt{n} ) \\\text{tr}(u \sqrt{n})  & \text{tr}(u\, n ) \end{array}\right]=2 \, \left[\begin{array}{cc}a & n b\\ n b & n a\end{array}\right] \,$ and $ \,\left[\begin{array}{cc}\text{tr}(1 )  & \text{tr}(\sqrt{n} ) \\\text{tr}(\sqrt{n})  & \text{tr}(\, n ) \end{array}\right]=2 \, \left[\begin{array}{cc}1 & 0\\ 0 & n \end{array}\right].$ now since, as noted in the begining, the forms associated to square units are isometric to the associated to $1$, there will be a nonsquare unit with form equivalent to $q_1$ iff this two forms are isometric (that's why I say it's enough to check for the fundamental unit). When $a$ is even (for example for $n=3$ and $n=7$ with  $u=2+\sqrt{3}$ and $u=8+3\sqrt{7}$ respectively), the forms are non even equivalent over $\mathbb{Z}_2$ ( because mod 4 one is $\left[\begin{array}{cc}0 & 2\\ 2 & 0 \end{array}\right]$ and the other $\left[\begin{array}{cc}2 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 \end{array}\right]$ ). So the more interesting case would be when $a$ is odd (for example for $n=39$ with $u=25+4\sqrt{39}$), in this case both $\frac{1}{2}q_1=x^2+n y^2$ and $\frac{1}{2}q_2=a x^2+2 b n \, xy+ n a \, y^2$ are primitive forms of discriminant $-4n$. And the question could be rephrased as Is it possible for $a x^2+2 b n \, xy+ n a \, y^2$  to be equivalent to $x^2+n y^2$? Or in the language of ideals in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-n}]$ Is it possible for the ideal  $\langle a, -b n+\sqrt{-n} \rangle_{\mathbb{Z}}$  to be principal? I wrote the this code in Magma which shows that this is never the case at least for $n<20000$ > for l in [0 .. 5000] do          >n:=4*l+3;               > if IsSquarefree(n) then                 > K := QuadraticField(4*n);                 >v:=FundamentalUnit(K);                 >a:=Abs(Trace(v)/2);                 >b:=Abs(Trace(v*K.1)/(2*n));                 > M1 := Matrix(2, [1,0,0,n]);                 > M2 := Matrix(2, [a,n*b,n*b,n*a]);                 >L1:=LatticeWithGram(M1);                 >L2:=LatticeWithGram(M2);                   > if  IsIsometric(L1,L2) then                  > n;                  > break l;                  > end if;                 > end if;        > end for;","Let $ \mathcal{O}$ be an order in a totally real number field $E$, then $( \mathcal{O},q_1 )$ is an integral lattice with its natural  quadratic form $q_1(x):=\text{tr}_{E/\mathbb{Q}}(x^2)$ (which is positive definite). Also, if $u$ is a totally positive unit in $ \mathcal{O}$, then the form $ q_2(x):=\text{tr}_{E/\mathbb{Q}}(u \,x^2)$ give us another positive definite lattice $( \mathcal{O},q_2 )$. When $u$ is a square unit, say $u=v^2$, this lattices are actually isometric by the map $\phi:( \mathcal{O},q_1 )\rightarrow( \mathcal{O},q_2 )$ given by $x \mapsto v^{-1} x$. Now, I've been trying (for a while) to deal with the reciprocal question, i.e., If there exists an isometry $\phi:( \mathcal{O},q_1 )\rightarrow( \mathcal{O},q_2 )$, then must $u$ be a square ?. So far all I've been able to say is that if exist $\kappa \in \mathcal{O}$ such that $\phi(x)=\kappa \, x$  for all $x\in \mathcal{O} $, then $\text{tr}_{E/\mathbb{Q}}(x^2)=\text{tr}_{E/\mathbb{Q}}(u \, \kappa^2 x^2)$ implies $\text{tr}_{E/\mathbb{Q}}((1-u \, \kappa^2) x^2)=0 \,\, \forall x \in \mathcal{O} $,  but then $1-u \, \kappa^2$ would be  $q_1-$orthogonal to all $\mathcal{O}$ and therefore $u=\kappa^{-2}$, however I have no idea how to prove (or if it is even possible to prove) that $\phi$ must be of this form for some $\kappa$. I'm especially interested  in the case  where $E$ is an $S_3$ cubic field (its normal closure has Galois group $S_3$). I haven't been able to find any counterexamples in this setting, I'd be more than grateful if someone could give some idea of how to find one. I also would like to know if there are some reference where to find things related to this sort of problems. Thanks in advance!.

Matomäki , Acta Math. Hungar.,128,no.4 (2010) 307--314. The abstract of the article is: We construct prime-representing functions. In particular we show that   there exist real numbers $\alpha \gt 1$ such that: $$\lfloor \alpha^{2^n} \rfloor$$ is prime for all $n\in \Bbb N$. Indeed the set consisting of such   numbers $\alpha$ has the cardinality of the continuum. So basically is a refinement of Mills'constant that is, to my surprise, able to provide a prime representing function working in the quadratic intervals $[n^2,(n+1)^2]$ (if I did not understand wrongly, this is for big enough $n$). My doubt regarding this is: as far as I can recall, Mills'constant is based on powers of three, $\lfloor A^{3^n} \rfloor$, and we still do not know if Legendre's conjecture is true or not, so there is not proof for a constant capable of making a prime-representing function like $\lfloor A^{2^n} \rfloor$.

So my guessing is that it is safe to say that (1) Still Legendre's conjecture is not proved to be true for all the existing quadratic intervals $[N^2,(N+1)^2]$, (2) Legendre's conjecture is true for those intervals associated to the primes generated by Matomäki's constant.

99,Triangular distribution of a+b sums for rationals a/b of bounded height,Triangular distribution of a+b sums for rationals a/b of bounded height,,"Let $a/b$ be a rational in $(0,1)$ expressed in lowest terms. The height of $a/b$ is $\max \{a,b\}$. For each rational in $(0,1)$ of height $\le h$, form the sum $a+b$. So, for example, here are the rationals of height $\le 6$ and their sums: \begin{array}{ccccccccccc}  \frac{1}{6} & \frac{1}{5} &    \frac{1}{4} & \frac{1}{3} &    \frac{2}{5} & \frac{1}{2} &    \frac{3}{5} & \frac{2}{3} &    \frac{3}{4} & \frac{4}{5} &    \frac{5}{6} \\  7 & 6 & 5 & 4 & 7 & 3 & 8 & 5    & 7 & 9 & 11 \\ \end{array} Now form a histogram of these sums.
