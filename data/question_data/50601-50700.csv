I have to choose the positive orientation for $\partial D$ but suppose that $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ already have the right orientations in order to have $+\partial D$ (I think that this is not restrictive).

Edit: I think the answer is that $2 \Re \left( f(x)\overline{g(x)}\overline{f(y)}g(y) \right)$ is sufficient, because  $$\int_a^b\int_a^b 2 \Re \left( f(x)\overline{g(x)}\overline{f(y)}g(y) \right) dxdy= 2 \Re \int_a^b\int_a^b f(x)\overline{g(x)}\overline{f(y)}g(y)dxdy \\=  2  \int_a^b\int_a^b f(x)\overline{g(x)}\overline{f(y)}g(y)dxdy,$$ because $$\int_a^b\int_a^b f(x)\overline{g(x)}\overline{f(y)}g(y)dxdy = \int_a^b f(x)\overline{g(x)}dx \int_a^b \overline{f(y)}g(y)dy\\ = \left( \int_a^b f(x)\overline{g(x)}dx\right) \overline{\left( \int_a^b f(y)\overline{g(y)}dy \right)}\\=\left| \left( \int_a^b f(x)\overline{g(x)}dx\right) \right|^2$$ is real. Addendum 2 : The user 900 Sit-ups a day (formerly ""This is much healthier"") challenged me to come up with a similar identity for vector-valued functions $\mathbf{f},\mathbf{g}$. We have the identity $$(f_i(t)g_j(s)-f_j(s)g_i(t))^2 = f_i(t)^2g_j(s)^2 + f_j(s)^2g_i(t)^2 - 2f_i(t)g_i(t)f_j(s)g_j(s).$$ Summing over all $i,j$ gives $$|\mathbf{f}(t)|^2|\mathbf{g}(s)|^2+|\mathbf{f}(s)|^2|\mathbf{g}(t)|^2=2\langle \mathbf{f}(t), \mathbf{g}(t) \rangle \langle \mathbf{f}(s),\mathbf{g}(s) \rangle + \sum_{i,j}(f_i(t)g_j(s) - f_j(s)g_i(t))^2 \\ \int_a^b \int_a^b |\mathbf{f}(t)|^2|\mathbf{g}(s)|^2+|\mathbf{f}(s)|^2|\mathbf{g}(t)|^2 dsdt= \int_a^b \int_a^b 2\langle \mathbf{f}(t), \mathbf{g}(t) \rangle \langle \mathbf{f}(s),\mathbf{g}(s) \rangle \\+ \sum_{i,j}(f_i(t)g_j(s) - f_j(s)g_i(t))^2ds dt \\ 2\int_a^b |\mathbf{f}|^2 \int_a^b |\mathbf{g}|^2 = 2 \left( \int_a^b \langle \mathbf{f},\mathbf{g} \rangle\right)^2 + \int_a^b \int_a^b \sum_{i,j}\left(f_i(t)g_j(s) - f_j(s)g_i(t) \right)^2ds dt\\ \int_a^b |\mathbf{f}|^2 \int_a^b |\mathbf{g}|^2 =  \left( \int_a^b \langle \mathbf{f},\mathbf{g} \rangle\right)^2 + \frac12 \int_a^b \int_a^b \sum_{i,j}\left(f_i(t)g_j(s) - f_j(s)g_i(t) \right)^2ds dt$$",,"['calculus', 'integration', 'definite-integrals', 'riemann-sum']"

I have the impression that it can be a sort of ""rabbit hole"" of a subtlety if one allows it to be. So, I tend to treat it as a black box. Eventually, though, adopting this attitude is bound to make a person feel guilty -- and then it's time to firm things up a bit. I know there are various ways of defining the integral of a Banach space-valued function. What I'm asking about here is an approach that I've always had in the back of my mind as something that ""should work"", but, when I tried to write down the details, I became less confident. Can anybody help me put this on rigorous footing? Or gently inform me that this approach is not good? Here is the sort of setting I have in mind. Let $X$ be a Banach space, say over $\mathbb{C}$, and let $f : \mathbb{R} \to X$ be continuous and such that $M : = \int_\mathbb{R} \|f(t)\| \ dt < \infty$. Now, for any $\varphi \in X^*$, we have $$ | \int \varphi \circ f | \leq \int |\varphi(f(t))| \ dt \leq \int \| \varphi \| \| f(t) \| \ dt = M \|\varphi\| $$ so it is not difficult to see that $\varphi \mapsto \int \varphi \circ f : X^* \to \mathbb{C}$ is a bounded linear functional, that is, an element of $X^{**}$. What I want to do now show is show that this element of the double dual is actually in $X \subset X^{**}$ so that there is an element $I \in X$ satisfying $\varphi(I) = \int \varphi \circ f$ for all $\varphi \in X^*$. One then defines $\int f := I$. The way I always envisioned doing this was by an application of the following fact: An element $\psi \in X^{**}$ is actually in $X \subset X^{**}$ if (and only if) it is continuous $X^* \to \mathbb{C}$ when $X^*$ has the weak-star topology. So, let's try to see if $\varphi \mapsto \int \varphi \circ f$ has this kind of continuity. Suppose that $\varphi_i$ is any net in $X^*$, convergent in the weak-start topology to some $\varphi \in X^*$. That is $\varphi_i(x) \to \varphi(x)$ for all $x \in X$. We want to show that $$ \int_\mathbb{R} \varphi_i(f(t)) \ dt \to \int_\mathbb{R} \varphi(f(t)) \ dt.$$ In our favour, we have that $\varphi_i \circ f \to \varphi \circ f$ pointwise over $\mathbb{R}$ (from the weak-star continuity). So, one thinks that Lebesgue's dominated convergence function may apply. But the problems with this are two-fold. We need a dominating function for the family of functions $t \mapsto \varphi_i(f(t))$. I think maybe the uniform boundedness principle can help here? The Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem applies to sequences not nets. Unless there is some way to finesse around this issue, I think this may be a more critical error. To reiterate, the slightly flabby question I'm asking is: Can the approach to defining $\int f$ I just outlined be ""rigourized""?

Now, my question is, 1) if given the fact that $f$ is integrable with respect to $g$ on $[a,b]$ can we say that $f$ is integrable with respect to $g$ on $(a,b)$ or $(a,b]$ or $[a,b)$? 2) If yes is it direct from the definition??(please be rigorous and not intuitive) 3) Are the integrals always equal?

Specifically, the inequality $\left| \int_a^b f(x)\,dx - (b - a) f(a) \right| \leq {(b - a)^2 \over 2} \sup_{a \leq x \leq b} \left| f'(x) \right|$ implies that the error $E_{n}$ of an $n$ term Riemann sum is bounded by $E_n \leq \frac{1}{2n}\sup_{0 \leq x \leq 1} \left| f'(x) \right|$ However, this is seemingly poor if the maximum of the first derivative is very peaked.  A smooth step function, for example, would have Riemann sum converging faster than the bound suggests: consider the separately the subsets of the domain where the first derivative is small and large, and add the errors together.  In the former subset you may use a smaller maximum for the derivative. My question is about improving this to use the total variation of the function $f$ instead of the derivative.  Intuitively if the function has large derivative --- but only briefly, like the step function --- then this should be evident from its total variation.  Is such a bound possible?","When estimating the convergence of a Riemann sum to its integral, or equivalently the error in numerical integration, the commonly used bound is by upper bounding it's first derivative (see, for example the section on wikipedia). Specifically, the inequality $\left| \int_a^b f(x)\,dx - (b - a) f(a) \right| \leq {(b - a)^2 \over 2} \sup_{a \leq x \leq b} \left| f'(x) \right|$ implies that the error $E_{n}$ of an $n$ term Riemann sum is bounded by $E_n \leq \frac{1}{2n}\sup_{0 \leq x \leq 1} \left| f'(x) \right|$ However, this is seemingly poor if the maximum of the first derivative is very peaked.  A smooth step function, for example, would have Riemann sum converging faster than the bound suggests: consider the separately the subsets of the domain where the first derivative is small and large, and add the errors together.  In the former subset you may use a smaller maximum for the derivative. My question is about improving this to use the total variation of the function $f$ instead of the derivative.
