18,Proving number of digits d to represent integer n in base B?,Proving number of digits d to represent integer n in base B?,,"I am interested in learning about proofs for discrete mathematics. One recurring fact I find in the literature is that the number of digits $d$ required to represent integer $N$ in base $B$ is  $\log_B{n}$ I am unhappy with this on two fronts. The first is that no source I have come across actually proves this claim. The second, I do not think the claim is true, and I am trying to prove this in a few ways but am finding slightly different results. If we have a $d$ digit string in base $B$, this is an element of the set $\{0,1,\dots,B-1\}^{d}$ which has $B^d$ elements. This means we can represent exactly $0,1,\dots,B^{d}-1$ using $d$ digits; solving for $N$ gives $d=\lceil \log_B{(N+1)}\rceil$. An alternative way to see this is that the largest integer we can represent is $\sum_{i=0}^{d-1}(B-1)*B^i$, which is also $B^d-1$ and gives the same result. Why then, do sources describe this as $\log_B(n)$? An alternative representation that is equally confusing is $\lfloor\log_BN\rfloor+1$; this requires a proof that $$\lfloor\log_BN\rfloor+1 = \lceil \log_B{(N+1)}\rceil$$ which I cannot seem to resolve; unless I am on the wrong track entirely.","I am interested in learning about proofs for discrete mathematics. One recurring fact I find in the literature is that the number of digits $d$ required to represent integer $N$ in base $B$ is  $\log_B{n}$ I am unhappy with this on two fronts. The first is that no source I have come across actually proves this claim. The second, I do not think the claim is true, and I am trying to prove this in a few ways but am finding slightly different results. If we have a $d$ digit string in base $B$, this is an element of the set $\{0,1,\dots,B-1\}^{d}$ which has $B^d$ elements. This means we can represent exactly $0,1,\dots,B^{d}-1$ using $d$ digits; solving for $N$ gives $d=\lceil \log_B{(N+1)}\rceil$. An alternative way to see this is that the largest integer we can represent is $\sum_{i=0}^{d-1}(B-1)*B^i$, which is also $B^d-1$ and gives the same result. Why then, do sources describe this as $\log_B(n)$? An alternative representation that is equally confusing is $\lfloor\log_BN\rfloor+1$; this requires a proof that $$\lfloor\log_BN\rfloor+1 = \lceil \log_B{(N+1)}\rceil$$ which I cannot seem to resolve; unless I am on the wrong track entirely.",,"['elementary-number-theory', 'discrete-mathematics', 'logarithms', 'number-systems', 'decimal-expansion']"

For the left hand side $\lfloor \sqrt {n+r} \rfloor = \lfloor \sqrt {\lfloor n+r\rfloor} \rfloor = \lfloor \sqrt n \rfloor$ holds (without further proof). $$\left\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{n+r}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} \frac{n}{2} & \quad \text{for n even} \\ \frac{n-1}{2} & \quad \text{for n odd} \end{array}\right.$$ Now I don't really know if that'd lead me in the right direction, but I'll write my thoughts down anyways. Let $\sqrt n =: n'+r'$, $n \in \mathbb{N}_0, 0\leq r < 1$. Therefore $\lfloor n'+r' \rfloor = n'$. And $n = (n'+r')^2 = n'^2 +2n'r' +r'^2$ For which $n',r'$ holds $$ n' < n'^2 + 2n'r' + r'^2.$$ Well and now I'm stuck and don't know how to proceed.

51,Codes that maximize average minimum distance from any tuple?,Codes that maximize average minimum distance from any tuple?,,"Inspired by this question . I'd wish to know about binary codes that seek to maximize, not the distance from each codeword to the nearest codeword, but the average distance from any vector ( $n-$ tuple) to the nearest codeword (or if both things are somewhat equivalent). More in detail: Let $T=\{0,1\}^n$ be the set of all $n-$ binary tuples. Let's call $C \subset T $ , with $|C|=M<2^n$ , a ""codebook"" (with each element being a ""codeword""). Let $$d_m^C=\min_{c_i, c_j \in C} d(c_i,c_j)\tag1$$ where $d()$ is the Hamming distance. In the theory of linear error correcting codes, one clasically wants to design a $(n,k)$ code (with $M=2^k$ and $C$ being a vector subspace) which has a big $d_m^C$ . One could also be interested in the average distance from a each codeword to the nearest different codeword $$d^C_a= \frac{1}{M}\sum_{c_i \in C} \min_{c_j \in C,j \ne i} d(c_i,c_j) \tag2$$ ... but for a linear code, $d^C_a=d^C_m$ , because all terms inside the sum are equal. Now suppose we are interested in computing the average distance to the nearest codeword, not from another codeword, but from each of the $2^n$ tuples: $$d^T_a= \frac{1}{2^n}\sum_{x_i \in T} \min_{c_j \in C} d(x_i,c_j) \tag3$$ Again, we wish to design a $C$ (linear or not) that attains a big $d^T_a$ , that is, that covers as evenly as possible (in this sense) the whole space. Has this been studied? Some bounds or asymptotics? In particular: are the usual codes, designed for high $d^C_a$ , expected to perform well also with regards to $d^T_a$ ? Some preliminary (mostly numerical) work of mine (for the other question) seems to suggest that a random code performs better than a (say) BCH code, which surprised me a bit. Also, it would seem that there is a computable asymptotical value, and that the random code attains it. I'd appreciate any pointers or answer.","Inspired by this question .

75,Understanding proof for $e \leq 3v - 6$ in planar graphs,Understanding proof for  in planar graphs,e \leq 3v - 6,"I have a  proof for a property of a planar graph: Lemma 5.8.4. In a planar embedding of a connected graph, each edge is traversed once by each of two different faces, or is traversed exactly twice by one face. Lemma 5.8.5 . In a planar embedding of a connected graph with at least three vertices, each face is of length at least three. Suppose a connected planar graph has $v \geq 3$ vertices and $e$ edges. Then $e \leq 3v - 6$ Proof. By definition, a connected graph is planar iff it has a planar embedding. So suppose a connected graph with $v$ vertices and $e$ edges has a planar embedding with $f$ faces. By Lemma 5.8.4, every edge is traversed exactly twice by the face boundaries. So the sum of the lengths of the face boundaries is exactly 2e. Also by Lemma 5.8.5, when $v\geq 3$ , each face boundary is of length at least three, so this sum is at least $3f$ . This implies that $3f\leq 2e$ But $f = e - v + 2$ by Euler’s formula, and substituting into the above gives $3(e - v + 2) \leq 2e$ $= e - 3v + 6 \leq 2e$ $= e \leq 3v - 6$ ( Source ) I have been trying to wrap my head around this, but I don't really get it fully. My main issues are: Why do we start with $v\geq 3$ ? Because 3 is the minimum number of vertices needed to forma planar embedding with more than 1 face, or what's the reason?

This implies that $3f\leq 2e$ Why do the two lemmas imply that $3f$ is lower or equal to $2e$ ? I understand each lemma on it's own, but I dont follow that conclusion, to be honest. What is also the significance of this?

However, how can I conclude this? Is $(2mk + k + m)$ in fact an integer? How do I know if the product of any two integers is an integer; similarly, does adding any two integers yield another integer?
