3,Does an essentially self-adjoint operator have the same kernel as its closure?,Does an essentially self-adjoint operator have the same kernel as its closure?,,"Let $H$ be a Hilbert space and let $A : D(A) \subset H \to H$ be an essentially self-adjoint operator. Let $\overline A$ be the unique self-adjoint extension of $A$. Question: Is it true that $\ker(A) = \ker(\overline A)$? I don't really see any reason for this to be true, so I tried constructing a counterexample... but somehow this is not so easy to do! For instance, I tried starting with the negative Laplacian $\Delta = - \frac{d^2}{dx^2}$ on $L^2(S^1)$ with domain $\mathrm{dom}(\Delta) = C^\infty(S^1)$. This is an essentially self-adjoint operator and the closure $\overline \Delta$ is easily understood if we look to the frequency domain. On $\ell^2(\mathbb{Z})$, we find $\overline \Delta$ is conjugate to the diagonal operator $D$ on $\ell^2(\mathbb{Z})$ given by $D(a_n) = (n^2a_n)$ and with domain $\{ (a_n) \in \ell^2(\mathbb{Z}) : (na_n) \in \ell^2(\mathbb{Z})\}$. From this, we conclude that $\Delta$ and $\overline \Delta$ have the same one-dimensional kernel.  $$\ker(\Delta) = \ker(\overline \Delta) = \{\text{constant functions}\} \subset L^2(S^1).$$ Next I tried to replace $\Delta$ by its restriction $\Delta_S$ to some smaller subspace $S \subset C^\infty(S^1)$ such that $S$ intersects trivially with the constant functions, but still manages to be a core for $\Delta$, i.e. has $\overline \Delta_S = \overline \Delta$. However, every subspace $S$ like this I try turns out to give a non essentially self-adjoint $\Delta_S$. For instance, taking $S = \{f \in C^\infty(S^1) : f(p) = 0\}$ for some point $p$ fails.

We can then define the Fredholm index by $$\mathrm{ind}(f) := \dim(\ker(f))-\dim(\mathrm{coker}(f)).$$ Is it true that $\mathrm{ind}(f+g)=\mathrm{ind}(f)$ if $g : V \to W$ has finite-dimensional range? I have tried to write down exact sequences and use that the Euler characteristic vanishes on such sequences, but this didn't work out. Another idea would be the following: We may assume wlog that $\mathrm{im}(g)$ is $1$-dimensional. Then write $g = w \otimes \alpha$ for some $\alpha \in V^*$ and $w \in W \setminus \{0\}$. Now two cases appear: 1) $w \in \mathrm{im}(f)$. 2) $w \notin \mathrm{im}(f)$. I have tried to compute $\dim(\ker(f+g))$ and $\dim(\mathrm{coker}(f+g))$ in each case, but didn't succeed. PS: I have borrowed the terminology for linear operators between Hilbert spaces ( Fredholm operator ). I don't know if this is standard.

To prove its linearity I used the linearity of the integral so: $\langle f, \alpha\phi+\beta\psi \rangle = \int_\mathbb{R}{|x|[\alpha\phi(x) + \beta\psi(x)]dx} = \alpha \langle f, \phi \rangle +\beta \langle f, \psi \rangle$ Then I tried to proved its continuity showing that $|\int_\mathbb{R}{|x|\phi(x)dx}| <M||\phi||_{D(\mathbb{R})}$ : $$\left|\int_\mathbb{R}{|x|\phi(x)dx}\right| \leq \left|\int_\mathbb{R}{|x| |\phi(x)|dx}\right| = \left|\int_{\operatorname{supp}(\phi)}{|x| |\phi(x)|dx}\right| \leq ||\phi||\int_{\operatorname{supp}(\phi)}{|x|dx}$$ but $\int_{\operatorname{supp}(\phi)}|x|dx$ doesn't converge if $\operatorname{supp}(\phi) = \mathbb{R}$. So I tried to prove continuity by showing that it's continuous in zero. $\langle f, 0 \rangle = 0$ $\langle f, \phi_k \rangle - \langle f, \phi \rangle = \int_\mathbb{R}|x|(\phi_k-\phi)dx \leq \sup|\phi_k-\phi|\int_\mathbb{R}|x|dx \rightarrow 0$ for $\phi_k \rightarrow\ \phi$ Is this correct?

Let $A$ be a C*-algebra, $M\subset B(H)$ be a con Neumann algebra and $\phi: A\rightarrow M$ be a completely positive map. Assume that the product map   $$\phi \times \iota_{M}: A\odot Mâ \rightarrow B(H),~\phi(\sum\limits_{i}a_{i}\otimes m_{i}â)=\sum\limits_{i}\phi(a_{i})m_{i}â.$$   is continuous with respect to the spatial (or minimal) tensor product norm and let $\pi: M\rightarrow B(K)$ be any normal representation. Then the product map $$(\pi \circ \phi)\times \iota_{\pi(M)â}: A\odot \pi(M)â\rightarrow B(K).$$   is also min-continuous (That is, continuous with respect to the spatial (or minimal) tensor product norm). Proof. Any normal representation of $M$ can be identified with the cut-down by a projection in the commutant of the representation $M\otimes 1_{K}\subset B(H\otimes K)$. Hence it suffices to show that the product map with the commutant in this particular representation is min-continuous. Since $(M\otimes 1_{K})'\cap B(H\otimes K)=M'\bar{\otimes} B(K)$ (Here, the $\bar{\otimes}$ denote the tensor product of two von Neumann algebra) -- just think of $B(H\otimes K)$ as matrices with entries in $B(H)$ -- we thus have to show that   $$(\phi\otimes1_{B(K)})\times\iota_{M'\bar{\otimes}B(K)}: A\odot(M'\bar{\otimes B(K)}~)\rightarrow B(H\otimes K)$$   is min-continuous. But, excepet for the horrific notation required, this is easy since $(\phi\otimes1_{B(K)})\times\iota_{M'\bar{\otimes}B(K)}$ is a point-strong limit of min-continuous maps (with uniformly bounded norms). More precisely, if $P\in B(K)$ is a finite-rank projection, then the map   $$(\phi\otimes1_{B(PK)})\times\iota_{M'\bar{\otimes}B(PK)}: A\odot(M'\bar{\otimes B(PK)}~)\rightarrow B(H\otimes PK)$$ is min-continuous and its norm is bounded by $||\phi\times \iota_{M'}||$ because it can be identified with $$(\phi\times\iota_{M'})\otimes id_{B(PK)}: (A\odot M')\odot B(PK)\rightarrow B(H\otimes PK)$$ (Here, it use the Exercise 3.5.1 in this book). Finally, taking a net $\{P_{\lambda}\}$ of finite-rank projections which converge to $1_{K}$ in the strong operator topology and fixing $$x=\sum a_{i}\otimes T_{i}\in A\odot (M'\bar{\otimes}B(K)),$$   it is easy to check that    $$(\phi\otimes 1_{B(P_{\lambda}K)})\times \iota_{M'\otimes B(P_{\lambda}K)}((1_{H}\otimes P_{\lambda})x(1_{H}\otimes P_{\lambda}))\rightarrow (\phi \otimes 1_{B(K)})\times \iota_{M'\bar{\otimes}B(K)}(x).$$   in the strong operator topology.

($\mathrm B(X,Y)$ is the normed space of bounded linear operators from $X$ to $Y$, with as norm the operator norm). It seems to me that this is not the case, and I have thought of (what I think is) a counterexample. I'm not completely sure about the last step I made and therefore would like to ask you to verify that it is correct, show me how to correct it, or tell me that my counterexample is wrong and why. Claim If $X$ is a complete normed space and $Y$ a normed space, $\mathrm B(X,Y)$ is not necessarily complete: Proof Consider $X=\ell^\infty(\N),Y=c_{00}(\N)$ ($c_{00}(\N)$ is the set of sequences of compact support), with the norm on $Y$ the $\ell^1$ norm. Let, for $n\in\N_{\geq 1}$, $T_n:X\to Y$ be given by  $$(x_1,x_2,x_3,\ldots,x_n,x_{n+1},\ldots)\mapsto\left(\frac{x_1}{1^2},\frac{x_2}{2^2},\frac{x_3}{3^2},\ldots,\frac{x_n}{n^2},0,0,\ldots\right)$$ For every $n\in \N_{\geq 1}$, $T_n$ is linear. Furthermore each $T_n$ is bounded: Let $x=(x_n)\in X$. Then $\|x\|=\sup|x_n|<\infty$. So  $$\|T_nx\|=\sum\limits_{k=1}^n\frac{|x_k|}{k^2}\leq \sum\limits_{k=1}^n\frac{\sup|x_n|}{k^2}=\sum\limits_{k=1}^n\frac{1}{k^2}\|x\|\leq\frac{\pi^2}{6}\|x\|$$ We conclude that for all $n\in\N_{\geq 1}, T_n\in \mathrm B(X,Y)$, because $$\|T_n\|\leq \frac{\pi^2}{6}$$ Furthermore $(T_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\mathrm B(X,Y)$: Let $\eps>0$. $\sum_{k=1}^\infty\frac{1}{k^2}$ converges, so there is an $N\in\N$ such that $\forall m,n\geq N$ we have $\sum_{k=m}^n \frac{1}{k^2}=\left|\sum_{k=m}^n \frac{1}{k^2}\right|<\frac{\eps}{2}$. Now let $x=(x_n)\in X$. Then $\|x\|=\sup |x_n|<\infty$ so for $m,n\geq N$ (wlog we assume $m<n$), we have $$\|(T_n-T_m)x\|=\sum\limits_{k=m+1}^n\frac{|x_k|}{k^2}\leq\sum\limits_{k=m+1}^n \frac{\sup|x_n|}{k^2}<\frac{\eps}{2}\|x\|$$ And from this it follows that for $m,n\geq N$  $$\|T_n-T_m\|\leq \frac{\eps}{2}<\eps$$ Finally, $(T_n)$ does not converge: This is the step that I'm not completely sure about. My idea is as follows We have $\mathrm B(X,\ell^1(\N))\supset \mathrm B(X,Y)$. $\mathrm B(X,\ell^1(\N))$ is complete (because $\ell^1(\N)$ is complete) and $(T_n)$ is also a Cauchy sequence in $\mathrm B(X,\ell^1(\N))$ and so it converges to a $T\in \mathrm B(X,\ell^1(\N))$. In fact we can give $T$ explicitly, for $x=(x_n)\in\ell^\infty(\N)$ we have $(Tx)_n=\frac{x_n}{n^2}$ for each $n\in\N_{\geq 1}$. Now it is clear that $T$ does not map $\ell^\infty(\N)$ into $c_{00}(\N)$ (consider the sequence with all entries equal to $1$ and what it gets mapped to) and so $T\not\in \mathrm B(X,Y)$. If $(T_n)$ would converge in $\mathrm B(X,Y)$ then it would converge to the same limit in $\mathrm B(X,\ell^1(\N))$ (because we consider $\mathrm B(X,Y)$ as a metric subspace of $\mathrm B(X,\ell^1(\N))$) so by uniqueness of limits in $\mathrm B(X,\ell^1(\N))$ we conclude that $(T_n)$ does not converge in $\mathrm B(X,Y)$.

96,Pointwise Ergodic Theorem - one particular estimate,Pointwise Ergodic Theorem - one particular estimate,,"I am struggling with an estimate in a proof of the pointwise ergodic theorem discussed in T. Ward and M. Einsiedler: Ergodic Theory with a view towards Number Theory, which is left as an exercise. I will first give a description of the proof in order to clarify notation, then point out the estimate which is giving me troubles and then state what I have ``found out'' up to now (which is not so much unfortunately): Pointwise Ergodic Theorem: Let $(X,\mathscr{B},\mu)$ be a probability space, $T:(X,\mathscr{B})\to(X,\mathscr{B})$ measue-preserving, $f:X\to\mathbb{C}$ an integrable, measureable function, i.e. $\int_{X}|f|\operatorname{d}\mu<\infty$. Let $$A_{N}(f)(x):=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}f(T^{n}(x))\quad \forall x\in X, \forall N\geq 1$$ Then there exists an integrable function $f^{\ast}$ such that the sequence $(A_{N}(f))_{N\in\mathbb{N}}$ converges to $f^{\ast}$ pointwise almost everywhere. Let's quickly discuss the structure of the proof, which tells us what we know already and which estimate is giving me trouble. The proof: We start by assuming that $f$ is almost surely bounded . Once we have checked this case, we will use density of $L_{\mu}^{\infty}(X,\mathscr{B})$ in $L_{\mu}^{1}(X,\mathscr{B})$ to deduce the general case. We know from the mean ergodic theorem (which does not yet require the boundedness of $f$), that we can find an almost surely $T$-invariant, integrable function $F$ such that:   $$F={\lim_{N\to\infty}}^{L_{\mu}^{1}}A_{N}(f)$$   i.e. $\lVert F-A_{N}(f)\rVert_{1}\stackrel{N\to\infty}{\longrightarrow}0$. The claim hence becomes: let $F$ be a representative of the $L_{\mu}^{1}\cap L_{\mu}^{\infty}$-limit of $(A_{N}(f))$, then $A_{N}(f)$ converges to $F$ pointwise almost surely.   This claim is formalized as follows:    $$\mu(\{x\in X; \lim\sup_{N\to\infty}|F(x)-A_{N}(f)(x)|>0\})=0$$   Note that the claim would follow from:   $$\mu(\{x\in X; \lim\sup_{N\to\infty}|F(x)-A_{N}(f)(x)|>\epsilon\})<2\epsilon \quad\forall\epsilon>0$$ by some standard argumentation (here my estimate is a bit weaker than in the original reference but this should not affect the result). Fix $M\in\mathbb{N}$ and $\epsilon>0$, then we know from the maximal ergodic theorem applied to the functions $g_{1}:=F-A_{M}(f)$ and $g_{2}:=A_{M}(f)-F$ (this is why the 2 pops up in my discussion) that:   $$\mu(\{x\in X;\sup_{n\geq 1}|A_{N}(F-A_{M}(f))|>\epsilon\})<2\epsilon$$ Now comes the critical estimate: The authors state that for fixed $M\in\mathbb{N}$ holds:   $$\begin{equation}\exists N_{0}\in\mathbb{N}\exists C_{M}>0:\quad N\geq N_{0}\Rightarrow|A_{N}(f)-A_{N}(A_{M}(f))|\leq C_{M}\frac{\lVert f\rVert_{\infty}}{N}\end{equation}$$   Given the critical estimate and $A_{N}$-invariance of $F$, we find:   $$\begin{align}\{x\in X;\lim\sup_{N\to\infty}|F(x)-A_{N}(f)(x)|>\epsilon\}=&\{x\in X;\lim\sup_{N\to\infty}|F(x)-A_{N}(A_{M}(f))|>\epsilon\}\\ \stackrel{\mu}{=}&\{x\in X;\lim\sup_{N\to\infty}|A_{N}(F-A_{M}(f))(x)|>\epsilon\}\\ \subseteq & \{x\in X;\sup_{N\geq1}|A_{N}(F-A_{M}(f))(x)|\}\end{align}$$   where for $A,B\in\mathscr{B}$ holds $A\stackrel{\mu}{=}B$ if $\mu(A\Delta B)=0$. This readily proves the claim. I turn to you for the critical estimate: I do not manage to get the $N$ in the denominator. My idea was to do the following: I was about to check that $A_{N}(A_{M}(f))\to F$ in $L_{\mu}^{1}$ which sounds quite intuitive, i.e. both sequences have the same limit. This sounds quite obvious as the limit is $T$-invariant. Then I intended to use boundedness of $f$ to find a uniform estimate for the difference. But I always have the problem that the summation over $n$ and $N^{-1}$ cancel each other. Furthermore all those estimates are but almost surely. Could you please given me a hint on why the critical estimate holds? Note that I am particularly interested in getting this proof to work, not in any proof of the Pointwise Convergence Theorem. Detailed Estimate: Thanks to @Davide Giraudo, I think I managed to prove it if $f$ is honestly bounded. In what follows let $\xi:=(\xi_{n})_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ be a bounded sequence and $U_{N}(\xi):=\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}\xi_{n}$. Using his idea, we get:   $$U_{N}(U_{M}(\xi))=\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}\sum_{m=n}^{M+n-1}\xi_{m}$$   A little drawing and induction shows that for fixed $M\in\mathbb{N}$ and $N\in\mathbb{N}$ way larger than $M$, we get:   $$\begin{align}U_{N}(U_{M}(\xi))=&\sum_{m=0}^{M-1}(m+1)\xi_{m}+M\sum_{m=M}^{N-1}\xi_{m}+\sum_{m=N}^{M+N-2}(M+N-1-m)\xi_{m}\\ =&U_{N}(\xi)+\sum_{m=0}^{M-1}m\xi_{m}+(M-1)\sum_{m=M}^{N-1}\xi_{m}+\sum_{m=N}^{M+N-2}(M+N-1-m)\xi_{m}\end{align}$$   so that:   $$U_{N}(U_{M}(\xi))-MU_{N}(\xi)=\sum_{m=0}^{M-1}(m+1-M)\xi_{m}+\sum_{m=N}^{M+N-2}(M+N-1-m)\xi_{m}$$   As $|m+1-M|\leq M$ for $m\in\{0,\ldots,M-1\}$ and $|M+N-1-m|\leq M+|N-m|\leq 2M$ for $m\in\{N,\ldots,M+N-2\}$, we find that for $x\equiv (f(T^{n}(x)))_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ holds:   $$\begin{align}|A_{N}(A_{M}(x))-A_{N}(x)|=&\frac{1}{NM}|U_{N}(U_{M}(x))-MU_{N}(x)|\\ \leq &\frac{1}{NM}\left\{\sum_{m=0}^{M-1}2M\lVert f\rVert_{\infty}+\sum_{m=N}^{M+N-2}2M\lVert f\rVert_{\infty}\right\}\leq\frac{2M}{N}\lVert f\rVert_{\infty}\end{align}$$ It remains for me to ensure that if $f$ is almost surely bounded, the estimate still holds almost everywhere. Range of validity of the estimate: This is in fact easy. Let $f$ lmost surely bounded, then there exists $B\subseteq\mathscr{B}$ with $\mu(B)=1$ and $f|_{B}$ bounded by $\lVert f\rVert_{\infty}$. Look at $B':=\cap_{n\geq 0}T^{-n}(B)$, then $\mu(B')=1$ as its complement is a countable union of nullsets and the estimate clearly holds on $B'$. But this requires us to change to:   $$\{x\in X;\lim\sup_{N\to\infty}|F(x)-A_{N}(f)(x)|>\epsilon\}\stackrel{\mu}{=}\{x\in X;\lim\sup_{N\to\infty}|F(x)-A_{N}(A_{M}(f))|\}$$   instead of a strict equality. But this doesn't pose any problems.","I am struggling with an estimate in a proof of the pointwise ergodic theorem discussed in T. Ward and M. Einsiedler: Ergodic Theory with a view towards Number Theory, which is left as an exercise. I will first give a description of the proof in order to clarify notation, then point out the estimate which is giving me troubles and then state what I have ``found out'' up to now (which is not so much unfortunately): Pointwise Ergodic Theorem: Let $(X,\mathscr{B},\mu)$ be a probability space, $T:(X,\mathscr{B})\to(X,\mathscr{B})$ measue-preserving, $f:X\to\mathbb{C}$ an integrable, measureable function, i.e. $\int_{X}|f|\operatorname{d}\mu<\infty$. Let $$A_{N}(f)(x):=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}f(T^{n}(x))\quad \forall x\in X, \forall N\geq 1$$ Then there exists an integrable function $f^{\ast}$ such that the sequence $(A_{N}(f))_{N\in\mathbb{N}}$ converges to $f^{\ast}$ pointwise almost everywhere. Let's quickly discuss the structure of the proof, which tells us what we know already and which estimate is giving me trouble. The proof: We start by assuming that $f$ is almost surely bounded . Once we have checked this case, we will use density of $L_{\mu}^{\infty}(X,\mathscr{B})$ in $L_{\mu}^{1}(X,\mathscr{B})$ to deduce the general case. We know from the mean ergodic theorem (which does not yet require the boundedness of $f$), that we can find an almost surely $T$-invariant, integrable function $F$ such that:   $$F={\lim_{N\to\infty}}^{L_{\mu}^{1}}A_{N}(f)$$   i.e. $\lVert F-A_{N}(f)\rVert_{1}\stackrel{N\to\infty}{\longrightarrow}0$. The claim hence becomes: let $F$ be a representative of the $L_{\mu}^{1}\cap L_{\mu}^{\infty}$-limit of $(A_{N}(f))$, then $A_{N}(f)$ converges to $F$ pointwise almost surely.   This claim is formalized as follows:    $$\mu(\{x\in X; \lim\sup_{N\to\infty}|F(x)-A_{N}(f)(x)|>0\})=0$$   Note that the claim would follow from:   $$\mu(\{x\in X; \lim\sup_{N\to\infty}|F(x)-A_{N}(f)(x)|>\epsilon\})<2\epsilon \quad\forall\epsilon>0$$ by some standard argumentation (here my estimate is a bit weaker than in the original reference but this should not affect the result). Fix $M\in\mathbb{N}$ and $\epsilon>0$, then we know from the maximal ergodic theorem applied to the functions $g_{1}:=F-A_{M}(f)$ and $g_{2}:=A_{M}(f)-F$ (this is why the 2 pops up in my discussion) that:   $$\mu(\{x\in X;\sup_{n\geq 1}|A_{N}(F-A_{M}(f))|>\epsilon\})<2\epsilon$$ Now comes the critical estimate: The authors state that for fixed $M\in\mathbb{N}$ holds:   $$\begin{equation}\exists N_{0}\in\mathbb{N}\exists C_{M}>0:\quad N\geq N_{0}\Rightarrow|A_{N}(f)-A_{N}(A_{M}(f))|\leq C_{M}\frac{\lVert f\rVert_{\infty}}{N}\end{equation}$$   Given the critical estimate and $A_{N}$-invariance of $F$, we find:   $$\begin{align}\{x\in X;\lim\sup_{N\to\infty}|F(x)-A_{N}(f)(x)|>\epsilon\}=&\{x\in X;\lim\sup_{N\to\infty}|F(x)-A_{N}(A_{M}(f))|>\epsilon\}\\ \stackrel{\mu}{=}&\{x\in X;\lim\sup_{N\to\infty}|A_{N}(F-A_{M}(f))(x)|>\epsilon\}\\ \subseteq & \{x\in X;\sup_{N\geq1}|A_{N}(F-A_{M}(f))(x)|\}\end{align}$$   where for $A,B\in\mathscr{B}$ holds $A\stackrel{\mu}{=}B$ if $\mu(A\Delta B)=0$. This readily proves the claim. I turn to you for the critical estimate: I do not manage to get the $N$ in the denominator. My idea was to do the following: I was about to check that $A_{N}(A_{M}(f))\to F$ in $L_{\mu}^{1}$ which sounds quite intuitive, i.e. both sequences have the same limit. This sounds quite obvious as the limit is $T$-invariant. Then I intended to use boundedness of $f$ to find a uniform estimate for the difference. But I always have the problem that the summation over $n$ and $N^{-1}$ cancel each other. Furthermore all those estimates are but almost surely. Could you please given me a hint on why the critical estimate holds? Note that I am particularly interested in getting this proof to work, not in any proof of the Pointwise Convergence Theorem.
