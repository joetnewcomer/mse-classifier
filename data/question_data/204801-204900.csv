10,Prove a graph is cyclic,Prove a graph is cyclic,,"I encountered the following problem: Let $G(V, E)$ be a finite undirected graph with $2n$ vertices, in which every connected component has an even number of vertices. Given that exactly $n$ of the vertices of $G$ have a degree at least $3$ , prove that $G$ is cyclic. My solution to the problem goes as follows: Let $C$ denote the set of all connected components $G_i(V_i, E_i)$ of $G$ and $|C| = k$ . Let's assume that $G$ is acyclic. That means that every $G_i$ is a tree. Then, by adding exactly $k-1$ edges to $G$ , we can connect all connected components in such a way (root of one to another one's leaf, ordering them in a sequence that way) that we obtain a tree $G'(V', E')$ , where $V'= V$ and $|E'| = |E| + k - 1$ . But since $G'$ is a tree, that means that $$|E'| = |V'| - 1 = |V| - 1 = 2n - 1$$ By the handshake lemma we also know that $$2|E'| = \sum_{v\in V'}\deg v \ge \underbrace{3n}_{\substack{\text{atleast $n$}\\ \text{with degree $\ge$ 3}}} + \underbrace{n}_{\substack{\text{G' is connected}\\\text{$\Rightarrow$ the remaining $n$ have $\deg\ge 1$}}}$$ Thus we obtain that $$2(2n-1) \ge 4n \Leftrightarrow -1 \ge 0$$ which is a contradiction, hence $G$ can't be acyclic and contains a cycle. Now, what bothered me about that is that I never used the given fact, that every $G_i$ had an even number of vertices, so I felt like I was missing something huge or my solution is flawed in a fundamnetal way... and I really banged my head against the wall hard enough, but was nonetheless unable to figure out what was wrong.

22,Proof that you can win at least half the money.,Proof that you can win at least half the money.,,"Suppose you play a game in which $n$ stacks of money each of different values, $a_1, ..., a_n$ are in a sequence on a table.  You get to choose either the left-most or right-most stack, then your opponent can do the same, and so on, until all stacks are gone. I need to prove that player 1 can always win at least half the money available when $n$ is even.  I initially tried induction but the inductive step wasn't clear. Suppose that you know the claim is true for $n=2k$ and consider a sequence of $2k+2$ stacks.  Picking the maximum of the two end stacks will not always result in an optimal choice.  If for instance the stacks are 1, 2, 100, 3 then as player 1 you might greedily choose 3 but then player 2 can choose 100.  If you instead selected 1 then player 2 would be forced to select a sub-optimal stack and you get the grab the 100. But I'm not sure how to prove this in general.  Certainly if the stacks are $a_1, ..., a_{2k+2}$ and if $a_1$ is maximal then it's optimal to pick that, and likewise for $a_{2k+2}$ .  But there are also examples where $a_2$ is maximal and yet it's not optimal to pick $a_{2k+2}$ .  For instance 3, 4, 3, 1.

Edit:  By plugging in simple numbers, for example x=1, b=1, c=1 and d=3 I can see that x is probably an integer, for all integers b,c,and d - so that means my thinking about the quadratic formula is not correct.  I will still work on this. 2nd Edit:  Now I plug in more numbers and don't get integers. For example $x^2+2x+3=4$.  I am also new to this site, so I am not sure if I should continue to edit the post or write in the comments sections anytime I think of something new.  Please advise. 3rd Edit: I think I know what to do.  The last section of the book covered universal quantifiers.  I believe the authors are are trying to get me to realize that they are saying $\forall b, c, d \in Z$ and I only need to give one one example for which the assertion is untrue.  And in my previous edit, b=2, c=3, and d=4 did not result in x being an integer.",,"['elementary-number-theory', 'discrete-mathematics']"

(xy \in L \land yz \in L \to xz \in L)\end{aligned}$$ Essentially, this is what you get if you translate $(x, y) \in R$ to $xy \in L$ , hence the name ""equivalence language."" On the exam itself I asked a question that isn't relevant here (it was basically a standard equivalence relation proof translated into formal language theory). After the exam, though, I started wondering about what sorts of languages these equivalence languages happen to be. What do they look like? What properties do they have? To begin with, it's not too hard to show the following. Every equivalence language $L$ contains the empty string $\varepsilon$ (apply property (I) to $\varepsilon$ ). Every equivalence language $L$ is closed under concatenation. Specifically, if $x \in L$ and $y \in L\text,$ then because $x\varepsilon \in L$ an $\varepsilon y \in L$ by property (III) we have $xy \in L\text.$ Restating (1) and (2), every equivalence language $L$ over $\Sigma$ is a submonoid of the free monoid $\Sigma^\star\text.$ Suppose we let $ER(\Sigma)$ denote the class of all equivalence languages. Then $ER(\Sigma)$ is closed under infinite union. In particular, the language $\bigcap ER(\Sigma)$ is itself an equivalence language, and is the minimal equivalence language over $\Sigma$ from an order-theoretic perspective. This last property is the source of my ultimate question, which is the following: Question (v1): What is $\bigcap ER(\Sigma)$ ? I have a limited answer to this question in the specific case where $\Sigma$ is small. Let $\Sigma$ be a language and let $Z(\Sigma) = \{ w \in \Sigma^\star \ | \ \text{every character in } \Sigma \text{ appears an even number of times in } w \}\text.$ So, for example, $\mathtt{ababcc} \in Z(\{\mathtt{a}, \mathtt{b}, \mathtt{c})$ . It intuitively makes sense that strings of this form will be in $\bigcap ER(\Sigma)$ because property (I) immediately gives us a bunch of strings that have even character counts. My conjecture is the following: Conjecture: $\bigcap ER(\Sigma) = Z(\Sigma)$ . I'm able to prove the following: Theorem: If $|\Sigma| \le 2\text,$ then $\bigcap ER(\Sigma) = Z(\Sigma)\text.$ Proving this isn't too hard. First show that the language $Z(\Sigma)$ is an equivalence language, then show that every element of $Z(\Sigma)$ belongs to every equivalence language. In the case where $|\Sigma| = 1$ this isn't too tricky to do. I thought it would be informative to include my proof for the case of $|\Sigma| = 2$ here, because it relies on a point that I'll need later on in this question. Proof for $|\Sigma| = 2$ : First check that indeed $Z(\Sigma)$ satisfies the three rules for equivalence languages (it does; this proof is independent of $|\Sigma|$ so I'll skip it here). Next we need to show that if $L$ is an equivalence language, then $Z(\Sigma) \subseteq L\text.$ So choose some arbitrary equivalence language $L$ . We're assuming $|\Sigma| = 2\text,$ and assume WLOG that $\Sigma = \{\mathtt{a}, \mathtt{b}\}$ . We need to show that $Z(\Sigma) \subseteq L\text,$ and we'll do that by induction on the length of the strings in $Z(\Sigma)$ . First, our base cases: strings of lengths 0, 2, and 4. Note that $\varepsilon \in Z(\Sigma)$ and that $\varepsilon \in L$ as well (as described above). Next note that $\mathtt{aa}$ and $\mathtt{bb}$ are the only length-two strings in $Z(\Sigma)$ , and each belongs to $L$ by property (I) of equivalence languages applied to $\mathtt{a}$ and $\mathtt{b}$ . There are eight strings of length four in $Z(\Sigma)$ : $\mathtt{aaaa}$ , $\mathtt{aabb}$ , $\mathtt{abba}$ , $\mathtt{baab}$ , $\mathtt{bbaa}$ , $\mathtt{abab}$ , $\mathtt{baba}$ , and $\mathtt{bbbb}$ . Of these, $\mathtt{aaaa}$ , $\mathtt{bbbb}$ , $\mathtt{abab}$ , and $\mathtt{baba}$ can be shown to be in $L$ via property (I) of equivalence languages. $\mathtt{aabb}$ and $\mathtt{bbaa}$ are in $L$ because $\mathtt{aa}$ and $\mathtt{bb}$ are in $L$ and $L$ is closed under concatenation. $\mathtt{baab}$ and $\mathtt{abba}$ can be shown to be in $L$ because $\mathtt{aabb}$ is in $L$ and these two strings are rotations of that string, which by property (II) are in $L$ . For our inductive step suppose that all strings of lengths $k$ and $k+2$ in $Z(\Sigma)$ are in $L$ . (We only need to worry about even lengths, so there are no strings of length $k+1$ in $L$ .) We'll show that all strings of length $k+4$ are in $L$ . Pick any string $w \in Z(\Sigma)$ of where $|w| = k+4$ . We consider two cases. Case 1: $w$ starts or ends with $\mathtt{aa}$ or $\mathtt{bb}$ . Assume WLOG that $w = \mathtt{aa}z$ for some string $z$ . We know $|w| = k+4$ , so this means $|z| = k+2$ . We can check that $z$ has an even number of copies of each character ( $w$ has an even number of copies of each character and we just dropped $\mathtt{aa}$ ), so $z \in Z(\Sigma)$ . Therefore by our IH we know $z \in L$ . We also know $\mathtt{aa} \in L$ from our base case, and since equivalence languages are closed under concatenation we know $\mathtt{aa}z = w \in L\text.$ Case 2: $w$ doesn't start or end with $\mathtt{aa}$ or $\mathtt{bb}$ . Then $w$ both starts with either $\mathtt{ab}$ or $\mathtt{ba}$ and ends with either $\mathtt{ab}$ and ends with $\mathtt{ba}$ . Assume WLOG that $w = \mathtt{ab}z\mathtt{ab}$ for some string $z$ of length $k$ . As above, $z \in Z(\Sigma)$ , so by our IH $z \in L$ . We also know that $\mathtt{abab} \in L$ from our base case, so $\mathtt{abab}z \in L$ as well. Applying Property (II) of equivalence languages to this string gives $\mathtt{ab}z\mathtt{ab} = w \in L\text.$ This means we always have $w \in L\text,$ as required. $\blacksquare$ Notice that the logic in the inductive step is heavily specific to the fact that we're working with a two-character alphabet, where it's possible to enumerate all possible ways that a string can start or end. But I don't see a nice way to generalize this to work with larger alphabets. While I'm conjecturing that $\bigcap ER(\Sigma) = Z(\Sigma)$ , I'm not fully convinced this is the case. For example, I don't see how to get $\mathtt{abcacb} \in Z(\Sigma)$ using the rules for equivalence languages plus the other properties listed above. All this is to say that a refined version of my question is as follows: Question (v2): Is the conjecture that $\bigcap ER(\Sigma) = Z(\Sigma)$ true? And now the plot thickens. While thinking about how I might prove this, I realized that there's a close connection between equivalence languages, $Z(\Sigma)$ , and walks in a hypercube graph. Specifically, given an alphabet $\Sigma$ where $|\Sigma| = n\text,$ think of an $n$ -dimensional hypercube and assign each axis a unique character from $\Sigma$ . We can interpret a string over $\Sigma$ as a series of instructions about how to walk around the hypercube. Each character means ""the next step is to walk on the edge along the axis associated with this character."" Every string in $Z(\Sigma)$ therefore corresponds to a walk in a hypercube that ends where it begins (e.g. a closed walk), since if there's an even number of copies of each character we ""undo"" every step we take. We can also check that the three rules for equivalence languages, applied to strings that are closed walks in a hypercube, preserve this property. Specifically: Property (I) says that any series of directions, repeated twice, returns home. Property (II) says that cyclically shifting a closed walk leaves a closed walk. Property (III) says that if one closed walk ends with the same sequence that a second closed walk starts with, we can ""cancel out"" the matching parts and glue the remaining steps together to get a closed walk. It's clear that these rules will give rise to closed walks and only closed walks, but it's not clear that these rules are sufficient to generate all possible closed walks on a hypercube. This connection between equivalence languages, $Z(\Sigma)$ , and hypercube walks gives rise to the final version of my question: Question (v3): What walks on a hypercube do you get if you begin with walks generated by property (I) and then repeatedly apply rules (II) and (III)? I'm curious for an answer to any version of the question. All of this is to say - I accidentally invented something much more nuanced than I anticipated when writing my final exam, and I'd like some clarity about what exactly I just unleashed on my students. :-)","I teach a class in discrete mathematics and formal language theory.

It turned out that if you close any $150$ cities, then there will be at least $150$ roads. What is the smallest number of roads in a country? My solution : We take a graph with $2n$ vertices such that each $n$ -vertex subgraph of it contains at least $n$ edges. Let us sum this number over all possible $n$ -vertex subgraphs. The resulting number will be greater or equal to $nC_{2 n}^{n}$ . Note that for each edge there are exactly $C_{2 n-2}^{n-2}$ $n$ -vertex subgraphs containing it. So each existing edge appears in the sum exactly $C_{2 n-2}^{n-2}$ times. Thus, the number of roads (edges of the original graph) is greater than or equal to $\dfrac{2 n(2n-1)}{n-1}$ .

And ""pairing"" puzzles where only empty squares and the mono-coloured ""star"" symbol is used. A 4x4 separating puzzle with a path that solves it (middle). . Various pairing puzzles. Both types of puzzle involve making envelopes between the path and the edge of the grid to enclose groups of symbols. Dots must be in seprate regions (envelopes) to dots of other colours, whereas stars must be in pairs. In separating puzzles the existence of any group of 3 adjacent squares in a puzzle that form the shape of the L shaped tromino with entirely dissimilar colours of dot symbols are unsolvable.

86,Is there a relationship between local prime gaps and cyclical graphs?,Is there a relationship between local prime gaps and cyclical graphs?,,"By defining the following algorithm I was able to generate some interesting graphs using the values of the gaps between consecutive primes : Start in any prime $p_i$, this will be the initial node, and calculate the distance to the next prime, then define $d_1 = d(p_i,p_{i+1})$ The next node will be the prime $p_{i+d_1}$. Then calculate the distance to the previous prime as $d_2 = -d(p_{i+d_1},p_{i+d_1-1})$ The next node will be the prime $p_{i+d_1+d_2}$ and do as in step 1 to define $d_3$ for the current node (forward step). Then next node will be the prime $p_{i+d_1+d_2+d_3}$ and do as in step 2 to define $d_4$ for the current node (backward step). Continue doing alternatively as in steps 3 and 4, defining the subsequent forward-backward jumps $d_5,d_6...$ etc. (There are three examples below). If $d_0=0$ is defined as the initial value of the sequence of $d_k$'s, then a generic calculation for $d_k$ for an initially given $p_i$ can be defined as: $d_k=(-1 + 2(k\ mod\ 2)) \cdot d(p_{(i+\sum_{t=0}^{t=k-1} d_{t})},p_{(i+\sum_{t=0}^{t=k-1} d_{t})-1+2(k\ mod\ 2)})$ And each node $n_k$ of the graph is defined for $k \gt 0$ as: $n_k = p_{(i+\sum_{t=0}^{t=k-1} d_{t})}$ In other words, the node $n_k$ is the $(i+\sum_{t=0}^{t=k} d_{t})^{th}$ prime, and the starting node is $n_1 = p_i$. My observation (the questions are related to this) is that the graph is always (1) itself a cycle (a clean Hamiltonian path ) or (2) it arrives to a sub graph that is a cycle, so from that point if subsequent $d_k$'s are generated, the nodes will never escape from the cycle. Please note that I consider a cycle only the case in which we arrive to an already existing node $n_k$ in a second or a third time, then the next $d_k$ is calculated, and the next node $n_{k+1}$ still is not included in the graph. The reason is that it is possible two calculations when arriving to a node, jumping $d_k$ primes forwards or backwards, depending on which step of the algorithm we did arrive to the node. For instance, that happens in the case of $p_i=11$. The algorithm arrives twice to $11$ but the second time the jump to the next node is backwards (a negative $d_k$) so the nodes $11 \gt 17 \gt 5 \gt 11$ are not considered to be in a cycle. In other hand, when the algorithm arrives to $2 \gt 3$ there is not possibility to escape from that continuous loop, so it is considered a real cycle and the algorithm ends. For instance this is an example of a clean Hamiltonian path (the graph is itself a cycle): $p_i=13$ $d_1=d(13,17)=4$ $p_{i+d_1}=29$ $d_2=-d(29,23)=-6$ $p_{i+d_1+d_2}=7$ $d_3=d(7,11)=4$ $p_{i+d_1+d_2+d_3}=19$ $d_4=-d(19,17)=-2$ $p_{i+d_1+d_2+d_3+d_4}=13$ So the complete graph is as follows (black arrows are odd, thus positive-valued, $d_k$'s, red arrows are even, thus negative-valued, $d_k$'s): When the graph is itself a clean cycle, a Hamiltonian path, then: $\exists k \in \Bbb N: \sum_{k=0}^{k=t} d_k = 0$. In the other hand this is an example of graph containing a cyclical sub graph (following the same algorithm to generate the graph): Tested with Python for $\forall \ p_i \in [0,47864431]$ (it gets quite slow after that point) in all cases it is possible to generate a finite graph like the ones above. There is not an example of a prime number capable of generating a graph with infinite nodes (continuously escaping to a greater prime while following the algorithm). In all cases the graphs have finite nodes and usually the elements of the graph are part of a ""local region"" around the initial prime $p_i$ (meaning that the graphs do not have nodes whose values are very distant, they are located in a close range around the original starting prime number $p_i$). The biggest graph in the tested range [0,47864431] was for $p_i=26730589$, including $60$ nodes: Similar tests can be done over other strictly increasing sequences with a ""pseudorandom"" behavior in the gaps between consecutive elements, like in the case of the abundant numbers and even deficient numbers. I asked another question looking for more similar sequences to make more tests here . Initially all of them are related with the prime divisors of the numbers, so they are also indirectly related to the primes themselves, and somehow the behavior of the gaps regarding the graphs explained above seems to be similar as well. My first thought is that this is possible because in all cases the gap $d_k$ for a given node is always smaller than or equal to the value of the counting function of the sequence up to that node. For instance the prime counting function $\pi(x)$ in the case of the prime numbers: $\forall k: d_k \le \pi(p_{(i+\sum_{t=1}^{t=k-1} d_{t})})$ And it seems so by checking the maximal prime gaps list and the index of the $p^{th}$ prime. I would like to ask the following questions: Is this behavior similar to the ""return to zero"" concept in random walks? Does it imply that there is a relationship between the local gaps? according to the heuristics it seems that the graphs can not    ""escape"" from the local region around the prime. Is there a counterexample of a $p_i$ prime whose gap with the next prime $g$ is strictly bigger than $i$, $g \gt i$? What implications could have a behavior like this, if any?

96,Why is this proof invalid?,Why is this proof invalid?,,"I don't understand why this theorem is false. Suppose that $A \subseteq C$ , $B \subseteq C$ , and $x \in A$ . Then $x \in B$ .

So what's the benefit of using strong induction when it's replaceable by weak induction? [EDIT] As requested, here's the weak induction version of the question.
