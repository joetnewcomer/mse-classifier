4,The equation $a^{4n}+b^{4n}+c^{4n}=2d^2$,The equation,a^{4n}+b^{4n}+c^{4n}=2d^2,"Recently, I found that if $a+b=c$ , then $a^4+b^4+c^4=2d^2$ for some positive integer $d$ . The parametric equation is: $$m^4+n^4+(m+n)^4=2(m^2+mn+n^2)^2$$ The condition $a+b=c$ (assuming $c \geqslant a,b$ ) isn't necessary. For example: $$7^4+7^4+12^4=2 \cdot 113^2$$ We can note that when we make the equation in the form $a^{4n}+b^{4n}+c^{4n}=2d^2$ , and we impose the condition $a^n+b^n=c^n$ for the parametric solution: (i) When $n=1$ , we can have any positive integers $a+b=c$ (ii) When $n=2$ , we can have any Pythagorean Triple $(a,b,c)$ . (iii) When $n>2$ , there are no solutions by Fermat's Last Theorem. Checking when $n=2$ , I saw that there are no solutions for $a \leqslant b \leqslant c \leqslant 3000$ where $a^2+b^2 \neq c^2$ .

In a sense, the squareness measures how close is $n$ to a perfect square. Example . The squareness ratios for the first ten number $n=1,2,\ldots,10$ are $$1,\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{3}    ,1,\frac{1}{5},\frac{2}{3},\frac{1}{7},\frac{1}{2},1,\frac    {2}{5}$$ Example . $n=1032 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 43$.

I define the squareness of a natural number $n$ to be the closest its factors can be partitioned into a balanced ratio of $1$. A perfect square has squareness $1$. A prime $p$ has squareness $1/p$. In a sense, the squareness measures how close is $n$ to a perfect square. Example . The squareness ratios for the first ten number $n=1,2,\ldots,10$ are $$1,\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{3}    ,1,\frac{1}{5},\frac{2}{3},\frac{1}{7},\frac{1}{2},1,\frac    {2}{5}$$ Example . $n=1032 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 43$.

So given such constraints and for any $p>3$ its well known that after substituting values of all variables its clear that both sides of the equation don't yield the same even number ( for any values ) .

So let us write down all such $\mathfrak{D}^{n}_{5}$   $$\mathfrak{D}^{1}_{5}=\left\{4=5^0*(5-1)\right\}$$  $$\mathfrak{D}^{2}_{5}=\left\{20=5^1*(5-1),24=5^1*(5-1)+5^0*(5-1)\right\}$$  $$\mathfrak{D}^{3}_{5}=\left\{100=5^2*(5-1),120=5^2*(5-1)+5*(5-1),124=5^2*(5-1)+5^1*(5-1)+5^0(5-1)\right\}$$ $$\mathfrak{D}^{4}_{5} = \{500,600,620,624\}$$ Here each element can be written as $\{500=5^3*(5-1),600=5^3*(5-1)+5^2*(5-1),620=5^3*(5-1)+5^2*(5-1)+5^1*(5-1),624=5^3*(5-1)+5^2*(5-1)+5^1*(5-1)+5^0*(5-1)  \}.$\  Similarly $$\mathfrak{D}^{5}_{5} = \{2500,3000,3100,3120 \}.$$\ Here also each element can be written as   $\{ 2500=5^5*(5-1),3000=5^5*(5-1)+5^2*(5-1),3100=5^5*(5-1)+5^4*(5-1)+5^3*(5-1),120=5^5*(5-1)+5^4*(5-1)+5^3*(5-1)+5^2*(5-1)+5^1*(5-1),3124=5^5*(5-1)+5^4*(5-1)+5^3*(5-1)+5^2*(5-1)+5^1*(5-1)+5^0*(5-1) \} $ Any pattern ?? . Yes there is a pattern sir. For any $O^{n}-O^{m}$ for any odd number $O$ and any integers $n,m (m<n)$ can be expressed as : \begin{equation}   O^{n}-O^{m}=\sum^{n-1}_{i=m} O^{i}*(O-1)   \end{equation} Now we can write the R.H.S of equation $$(p^{x}-p^{x-z}+3)=k(l+1)$$ as $$p^{x}-p^{x-z}= \sum^{x-1}_{x-z} p^i.(p-1)$$ After expanding the series and simplyifying we obtain  $$p^{x-z}(p-1).\large\frac{p^x-1}{p-1}$$ $$p^{x-z}(p^z-1)$$ So we can equate to get $$p^{x-z}(p^z-1)=k(l+1)-3.$$ So we need to prove that both sides of the equation don't yield the same even number leading to a conrtradiciton. Hence I am trying that. I am here with a question again. Suppose we have an equation of this form $$p^{x-z}(p^{z}-1)=k(l+1)-3$$ where $p$ is an odd-prime, $z,y$ are integers and $y>0$ always ($x=2y+z, $ for some integer $x$ ) , $k$ is an odd number and $l$ is an even number. So given such constraints and for any $p>3$ its well known that after substituting values of all variables its clear that both sides of the equation don't yield the same even number ( for any values ) . So how can we prove it ?. I have been trying to  prove it using congruences, but that didn't take me anywhere. So I wanted to ask it here.

20,Exponential diophantine equation involving a prime number,Exponential diophantine equation involving a prime number,,"Few days ago I found a question which was unfortunately put ""on hold"" and later it was even deleted. The question asked to solve the following exponential diophantine equation $$p^{p+1}+(p+1)^p=x^2$$ where $x$ is a positive integer and $p$ is a prime number. Since I like diophantine equations I found this one very interesting and I tried to solve it. Here is what I did: we can assume that $p$ is odd because for $p=2$ there is no solution, so $p+1=2n$ and thus we can write $$(2n)^p=(p+1)^p=x^2-p^{2n}=(x+p^n)(x-p^n).$$ Now, from the original equation we get that $x$ is odd and $x\equiv \pm 1\pmod p$, then $\gcd(x+p^n, x-p^n)=2$, and therefore we can write $x+p^n=2^{\alpha}\cdot y$ and $x-p^n=2^{\beta}\cdot z$, with exactly one of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ being equal to $1$ because $\alpha+\beta\ge p\ge 3$. More precisely, if $n=2^r\cdot m$, then $$2^{p+rp}\cdot m^p=2^{\alpha+\beta}\cdot yz.$$ Hence $p(r+1)=\alpha+\beta$ and $m^p=yz$ with $\gcd(y,z)=1$, which means that $y=y_1^p$ and $z=z_1^p$, for some $y_1, z_1\in\Bbb{Z}^+$ such that $\gcd(y_1, z_1)=1$. Sadly, I couldn't do anything else and I got stuck here until I remembered that the general equation $y^x+x^y=z^2$ was solved in this paper when $\gcd(x,y)=1$, $xy$ is even and $\min\{x,y\}>1$. In our particular equation the required conditions are satisfied because $\gcd(p+1,p)=1$, $(p+1)p$ is even and $\min\{p+1,p\}\ge 3$, so according to that paper our equation doesn't have any solutions. The only problem that I found is that the equation $y^x+x^y=z^2$ was solved using bounds for linear forms in logarithms , which are beyond from being elementary.

39,On odd perfect numbers $N$ given in the Eulerian form $N = {q^k}{n^2}$,On odd perfect numbers  given in the Eulerian form,N N = {q^k}{n^2},"Note: This question was cross-posted from MO . Preamble:  I apologize in advance if this particular MSE post would appear to be a bit of a polymath approach, I just had to put down all the details to present my argument for this particular math problem. A positive integer $N$ is said to be perfect if $\sigma(N)=2N$, where $\sigma(x)$ is the sum of the divisors of $x$. An odd perfect number $N$ is said to be given in Eulerian form if $N = {q^k}{n^2}$, where $q$ is prime, $q \equiv k \equiv 1 \pmod 4$ and $\gcd(q,n)=1$. Since $\gcd(q,n)=1$ and prime powers are deficient, we have $q \neq n$ and $q^k \neq n$. In an earlier version of the paper The Abundancy Index of Divisors of Odd Perfect Numbers (see here ), it was conjectured that the biconditional $$q^k < n \Longleftrightarrow \sigma(q^k) < \sigma(n) \Longleftrightarrow \frac{\sigma(q^k)}{n} < \frac{\sigma(n)}{q^k}$$ is true.  (Note that the proof of the inequation $$\frac{\sigma(q^k)}{n} \neq \frac{\sigma(n)}{q^k}$$ is trivial.) Recently, an attempt to prove the said biconditional appears to have been completed in this preprint . I present here the highlights of the said proof: One direction of the biconditional is trivial: $$q^k < n \Longrightarrow \frac{\sigma(q^k)}{n} < \frac{\sigma(n)}{q^k}.$$ This is proved by noting that $I(q^k) < \sqrt[3]{2} < I(n)$ (where $I(x) = \sigma(x)/x$ is the abundancy index of $x$), from which the following chain of implications follow: $$q^k < n \Longrightarrow \sigma(q^k) < \sigma(n)$$     $$q^k < n \Longrightarrow \frac{1}{n} < \frac{1}{q^k}$$     $$\{\sigma(q^k) < \sigma(n)\} \land \{\frac{1}{n} < \frac{1}{q^k}\} \Longrightarrow \frac{\sigma(q^k)}{n} < \frac{\sigma(n)}{q^k}$$ Therefore: $$q^k < n \Longrightarrow \sigma(q^k) < \sigma(n) \Longrightarrow \frac{\sigma(q^k)}{n} < \frac{\sigma(n)}{q^k}.$$ For the other direction: The implication $$\frac{\sigma(q^k)}{n} < \frac{\sigma(n)}{q^k} \Longrightarrow \sigma(q^k) < \sigma(n)$$     can be proved, again by observing that $I(q^k) < \sqrt[3]{2} < I(n)$. Now, to prove the last implication: $$\sigma(q^k) < \sigma(n) \Longrightarrow q^k < n$$ we take an indirect approach. First we show that: If $N = {q^k}{n^2}$ is an odd perfect number given in Eulerian form and $$I(q^k) + I(n) < \frac{\sigma(q^k)}{n} + \frac{\sigma(n)}{q^k},$$ then $q^k < n \Longleftrightarrow \sigma(q^k) < \sigma(n)$. Similarly, we can prove that: If $N = {q^k}{n^2}$ is an odd perfect number given in Eulerian form and $$\frac{\sigma(q^k)}{n} + \frac{\sigma(n)}{q^k} < I(q^k) + I(n),$$ then $q^k < n \Longleftrightarrow \sigma(n) < \sigma(q^k)$. Observe that $$I(q^k) + I(n) = \frac{\sigma(q^k)}{n} + \frac{\sigma(n)}{q^k}$$ if and only if $$\sigma(q^k) = \sigma(n).$$ Also, observe that if we assume $$\frac{\sigma(q^k)}{n} + \frac{\sigma(n)}{q^k} < I(q^k) + I(n)$$ then the biconditional $$q^k < n \Longleftrightarrow \sigma(n) < \sigma(q^k)$$ will contradict $I(q^k) < \sqrt[3]{2} < I(n)$. Therefore, the following inequality must be true: $$I(q^k) + I(n) \leq \frac{\sigma(q^k)}{n} + \frac{\sigma(n)}{q^k}.$$ It suffices to consider the case when $$I(q^k) + I(n) = \frac{\sigma(q^k)}{n} + \frac{\sigma(n)}{q^k}$$ which is true if and only if $$\sigma(q^k) = \sigma(n).$$ This last equation, together with the inequality $I(q^k) < \sqrt[3]{2} < I(n)$, implies that $$1 = \frac{\sigma(q^k)}{\sigma(n)} < \frac{q^k}{n}$$ from which it follows that $n < q^k$. Thus, $1/q^k < 1/n$, which then gives, together with the equation $\sigma(n) = \sigma(q^k)$, the inequality $$\frac{\sigma(n)}{q^k} < \frac{\sigma(q^k)}{n}.$$ But this last inequality, together with $I(q^k) < \sqrt[3]{2} < I(n)$, is known to imply $$n < q^k.$$ Consequently, if $$I(q^k) + I(n) = \frac{\sigma(q^k)}{n} + \frac{\sigma(n)}{q^k}$$ then $$n < q^k \Longleftrightarrow \frac{\sigma(n)}{q^k} < \frac{\sigma(q^k)}{n}$$ Now, here is the part where I am a bit unsure about logical solidity : Lastly, note that since $$\sigma(q^k) = \sigma(n)$$ implies $n < q^k$, the biconditional $$q^k < n \Longleftrightarrow \sigma(q^k) < \sigma(n)$$ is vacuously true, under this case. NOW HERE IS MY QUESTION (and this is also the main reason for this MSE post): I have been told that there is a gap in the last part of this proof.  As I     myself am having a hard time spotting where that particular error is, would     somebody be kind enough as to help by skimming through this argument and then      (after glossing over the details) give it either a PASS or a FAIL ?","Note: This question was cross-posted from MO .

Unfortunately, its ""official"" solution is wrong: The solution states that $m! - n!$ contains a prime factor larger than $m$ , however $37! - 35! = 35! \times (36 \times 37 - 1) = 35! \times 11^3$ .

But the ""proof"" that I posted raised some questions that intrigued me, so I will repost it here and then raise my questions. Here we go ... I will start with the supposition that Fermat’s celebrated conjecture is false i.e., that there do in fact exist non-zero integer values of $x$ , $y$ , $z$ , and $n>2$ such that $$x^n+y^n=z^n$$ The degenerate case of $y=x$ will be ignored, since $2^{1/n}$ is irrational for $n>1$ , proving the conjecture for this trivial instance. Accordingly, since the ordering of $x$ and $y$ above is arbitrary, the fraction $r=y/x$ which is by definition rational, can be constrained to $0<r<1$ . Substitution into the supposition above, leads to $$\frac{x}{z}=(1+r^n)^{-\frac{1}{n}}$$ The LHS is (again, by definition) rational. Proof of Fermat’s conjecture therefore, requires proving that the RHS cannot be rational for $n>2$ , for any $r\in \mathbb{Q}$ . With the Generalised Binomial Theorem, we have $$ (1+r^n)^{-\frac{1}{n}} = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} {{-n^{-1}}\choose{k}}r^{kn} = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-n^{-1})_k}{k!}\prod_{j=1}^{kn}r $$ which converges absolutely, since $|r|<1$ ( $y\neq x$ ), and the Pochhammer Symbol for the Binomial Coefficient is $$(-n^{-1})_k=-n^{-1}(-n^{-1}-1)(-n^{-1}-2)\cdots(-n^{-1}-k+1)$$ Note that for finite $k$ , each term of the series is a finite product of rationals and hence rational. However, if it can be proved that in the limit $k\rightarrow \infty$ , the product of the infinite products always yields an irrational number for $n>2$ and $r\in \mathbb{Q}$ , then Fermat’s conjecture is at once proved. Moreover, even if this were not the case, the falsity of the conjecture would still require showing that the infinite sum of rationals provably converges to a rational. For $n=2$ , there are at least some rational values of $r$ corresponding to the Pythagorean triples, for which the infinite sum does apparently converge to a rational number. Formal proof of Fermat’s conjecture for  therefore, requires demonstrating that there are no rational values of $r$ for which this is the case. I will resist the juvenile urge to “Pull a Fermat” again, and claim that I have a proof that is too large to fit here, and instead readily concede that such a proof is well above my capabilities as a lowly engineer. I do have the following questions, however: 1) Is this a viable approach? 2) Has something along these lines been attempted by Number Theorists before? 3) Can a form of the Thue-Siegel-Roth Theorem be used to determine the convergence to a rational/irrational?

I was trying to answer someone else's question on yahoo answers today and I got thumbs down from people on my answer and have come here to get a thorough proof on it because now I just must know! :) My assertion: Suppose we have two integers a and b. We can form a rational numbers out of each of these: $\frac{a}{1}$ and $\frac{b}{1}$. Now forming another rational by dividing them: $\frac{\frac{a}{1}}{\frac{b}{1}}$ = $\frac{a}{b}$. Now if we divide this by itself: $\frac{\frac{a}{b}}{\frac{a}{b}}$ = $\frac{ab}{ab}$ = 1. Therefore, we can conclude that given any rational number, we can always describe it using only integers thus always resulting in an integer number. However, even if our radius is $\sqrt{\frac{1}{\pi}}$ then we will have $\pi\sqrt{\frac{1}{\pi}}^2$ = $\frac{\pi}{\pi}$, by definition of area = $\pi r^2$. Now I think this the trickiest part. Does  $\frac{\pi}{\pi}$ = 1? Or can it only equal  $\frac{\pi}{\pi}$? How do we prove that  $\frac{\pi}{\pi} \neq$ 1? Or is my method sufficient at all?

I was trying to answer someone else's question on yahoo answers today and I got thumbs down from people on my answer and have come here to get a thorough proof on it because now I just must know! :) My assertion: Suppose we have two integers a and b. We can form a rational numbers out of each of these: $\frac{a}{1}$ and $\frac{b}{1}$. Now forming another rational by dividing them: $\frac{\frac{a}{1}}{\frac{b}{1}}$ = $\frac{a}{b}$. Now if we divide this by itself: $\frac{\frac{a}{b}}{\frac{a}{b}}$ = $\frac{ab}{ab}$ = 1. Therefore, we can conclude that given any rational number, we can always describe it using only integers thus always resulting in an integer number. However, even if our radius is $\sqrt{\frac{1}{\pi}}$ then we will have $\pi\sqrt{\frac{1}{\pi}}^2$ = $\frac{\pi}{\pi}$, by definition of area = $\pi r^2$. Now I think this the trickiest part.
