It seems to me that we mainly want closure under arbitrary unions and finite intersections, which appears to be the more natural part of the definition (unlike ""forcing"" $\varnothing$ and $X$ to be open, which feels rather contrived). Of course, we get the empty set for free if we take an arbitrary union of nothing ($\bigcup \varnothing = \varnothing$), so that part really doesn't need to be in the definition. Let's define a new word: A tolology on $X$ is a subset of $\mathcal P(X)$ that is closed under arbitrary unions and finite intersections.

If $\bigcup \mathscr T' = X$, then closure under arbitrary unions forces us to throw $X$ back in anyway, so the topological closure coincides with the tolological closure, nothing interesting here. Otherwise (this is what bothers me), we have $\bigcup \mathscr T' \subsetneq X$, then $\mathscr T'$ is still closed under arbitrary unions and finite intersections, so it's a tolology but not a topology.

(Actually, any $T_1$ space must satisfy $\bigcup \mathscr T' = X$ by definition, and that probably covers just about every theorem in topology.) Since un-requiring $X$ to be open doesn't give us any fewer theorems than we already have, and those spaces whose topology and tolology are different are as uninteresting as it gets, why can't we replace the definition of topology with that of tolology for simplicity's sake?

Here is my attempt at the proof, Suppose that Bdry$(A)=\emptyset$. Then $\bar{A}=A$ $\cup$ Bdry$(A)=A\cup\emptyset=A$. Hence, $\bar{A}=A$, which implies that $A$ is closed. To show that $A$ is also open we will show that $\overline{C(A)}=C(A)$, that is, $C(A)$ is closed and hence $A$ open.

The definition of (real) vector bundle that I'm working with is as follows: We have two topological spaces B and E and a continuous surjection $$\pi : E \to B$$ such that each fiber $\pi^{-1}(b)$ has the structure of a vector space. Furthermore, these data satisfy a ""local triviality"" or ""bundle"" condition: For every point $p \in B$ , there is an open neighborhood $U \subseteq B$ of $p$ , an integer $k \geq 0$ and a homeomorphism $\varphi : U \times \mathbb{R}^k \to \varphi^{-1}(U)$ , such that $\pi \circ \varphi(x,v) = x$ , and the map $v \mapsto \varphi(x,v)$ is an isomorphism from $\mathbb{R}^k$ to $\pi^{-1}(x)$ for each $x \in U$ .

There are many classical examples of one-to-one immersions which are not emeddings e.g. a line of irrational slope on the 2-torus. The assiciated inclusion map in this case is obviously not proper, but I am having trouble thinking of an embedded submanifold which is not properly embedded. There are examples when the ambient manifold is not Hausdorff, for instance, but can someone think of an example when both manifolds are well behaved?",,"['general-topology', 'differential-geometry', 'differential-topology']"
