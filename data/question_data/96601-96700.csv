Some insights: Since $f$ and $g$ are holomorphic, their modulus $|f|$ and $|g|$ are subharmonic and attains maximum on the boundary. $-|g|$ is superharmonic and attains minimum on the boundary. Since $f$ does not vanish in the domain $log|f|$ is harmonic and attains minimum on the boundary. So in fact since $log$ is a monotonic function, $|f|$ also attains minimum on the boundary. In total we have a sum of two functions, $|f|$ and $-|g|$, both attain their minimum on the boundary. For general functions, this does not imply that the sum should attain minimum on the boundary.

20,Branch-point order and Cauchy representation,Branch-point order and Cauchy representation,,"This question is about the nature of branch points which arise in certain Cauchy-integral representations of functions of a single complex argument, $z$. Suppose we have the following representation: \begin{align} f(z) &= \frac{1}{\pi}\int_0^\infty dx \frac{\mbox{Im } f(x)}{x-z}, \end{align} where we assume the integral exists for $z=0$. This function has branch-point singularities at $z=0,\infty$ due to the fact that the (constant) endpoints of integration coincide with the pole of the integrand at those points. The question that I have regarding the order of the branch point is equivalent to understanding the behavior of $f(z)$ as a circuit is traced around the branch point $z=0$. Suppose I define the ""first sheet"" as the values $f^{(I)}$ of $f(z)$ where $z=x_0+i\epsilon$ ($\epsilon$ infinitesimal, as usual). I consider a circuit in the $z$-plane as $z=x_0e^{i\theta}$ ($0<\theta<2\pi$). The function is analytic at all points on this trajectory. Once, however, we consider $2\pi < \theta$ we must distort the contour to avoid the singularity in the integrand at $x=x_0$. This effects the analytic continuation of $f(z)$ onto what we'll call the ""second sheet"". The value $f^{(II)}$ of $f(x_0)$ on the second sheet is \begin{align} f^{(II)}(x_0) &= \frac{1}{\pi}\int_0^\infty dx \frac{\mbox{Im } f^{(I)}(x)}{x-(x_0-i\epsilon)},\\ &= \frac{1}{\pi}\int_0^\infty dx \frac{\mbox{Im } f^{(I)}(x)}{x-x_0}-i\,\mbox{Im }f^{(I)}(x_0). \end{align} This demonstrates that $f(x_0+i\epsilon)-f(x_0-i\epsilon) = 2i\,\mbox{Im }f(x_0)$ and shows that the integration contour is the branch cut.

24,Joukowski Aerofoil Plot,Joukowski Aerofoil Plot,,"I've just had a go at plotting flow around aerofoils and I've come across a problem where I can't spot where I've gone wrong. I've previously worked out that the complex potential flow around a disk with added circulation (to satisfy the stagnation point being on the trailing edge) is given by $$\Omega (z)=U\left(ze^{-i\phi}+\frac{e^{i\phi}}{z}\right)+2iUsin\phi ln(z).$$ To transform the disk into an aerofoil shape, I (think!) I need to apply the Joukowski Mapping to an off-centred disk. I can then find the inverse of this map and substitute this into the previously known flow around a disk and plot the streamlines. Now to do this, I thought to first apply an affine transformation to map the disk to an off-centred disk that passes through the point $\zeta=1$ and encloses $\zeta=-1$ (the two critical points of the Joukowski transform), and then apply the Joukowski map, work out the inverse and substitute into the known flow. So here goes: first I apply the transformation $$w=\alpha z +\beta,$$ such that $\alpha = |1-\beta|$. This maps the disk $|z|\leq 1$ to a disk centred $\beta$, radius $\alpha$. Then applying the Joukowski map $$\zeta=\frac{1}{2}\left(w+\frac{1}{w}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\left(\alpha z +\beta+\frac{1}{\alpha z +\beta}\right),$$ and solving for z, $$z=\frac{\zeta-\beta+\zeta\sqrt{(1-\frac{1}{\zeta^2})}}{\alpha} .$$ Substituting this into the known flow and plotting the imaginary part, if I simply shift the disk along the real axis, I get roughly what I expect (the green line being the dividing streamline): But if I shift the disk upwards, whilst I get the right sort of shape, it's clearly not correct: If anyone could give me a push as to where I've gone wrong it would be appreciated.

But I don't quite get some part of the solving process which I need help on deciphering. If I can understand what he was doing, my specific problem can be solved. So now let's take the problem in the Appendix of Noolandi's paper for example. The function is $\displaystyle \tilde I(s) = \frac{1-\exp(-a(s)t_0)}{a(s)}$ where $\displaystyle a(s)t_0 = \Sigma_{i=1}^n \frac{s\omega_i}{s+r_i} t_0 = \Sigma_{i=1}^n \frac{sM_i}{s+r_i}$. ""$s$"" is the variable. $\omega_i$, $r_i$, $t_0$, and $M_i$ are all real numbers greater than zero. The question is how to get inverse Laplace transform $L^{-1}[\tilde I(s)]$. It looks like the author used Residue Theorem to evaluate the contour integral $\int_C \tilde I(s) \exp(st) ds$, but the hard part is the singularities are essential singularities, thus the residues can not be got conventionally. However, it seems that the author constructed a contour and solved it numerically . I don't get Equation A5-A8 in the Appendix, and don't understand how to determine the parameter $R$ and $R_1$ he introduced in (probably something related to numerics). Could anyone please help point out what he was doing? Thanks very much! By the way, the author also said the inverse Laplace transform could also be evaluated using  Laplace transform tables.

But in case of Complex functions, the point can be approached from infinitely many directions. Then how can we check that the derivatives from all the directions are equal? I think in case of Complex functions, we should approach the point angularly. For example, to find a derivative at a point $z$, we can rotate through an angle $d\theta$ about the origin clockwise or anti-clockwise and then find the difference in the value of the function, then divide by the angle change and apply the limit $d\theta \rightarrow0$. In this case, we'll have clock-wise and anti-clockwise derivatives and we can see if they're equal. So, if the argument of $z$ is $\arg{(z)}$, then the derivative would be: $$\lim_{d\theta \rightarrow0}\frac{f(|z|(\cos{(\arg{(z)}+d\theta})+i\sin{(\arg{(z)}+d\theta})))-f(z)}{d\theta}$$ I think approaching the point angularly should be more convenient than approaching the point from all directions. So, why do we approach the point linearly even in case of Complex functions? EDIT: I've one more idea, we can even approach the point from outward and inward directions along the line joining the point with the origin. So, we have outward derivative and inward derivative. In this case the angle remains constant but the modulus changes by an infinitesimal amount. It will be: $$\lim_{dz\rightarrow 0}\frac{f((|z|+dz)(\cos{(\arg{(z)})}+i\sin{(\arg{(z)})})-f(z)}{dz}$$ So, if a Complex function is given as a function of modulus ($|z|$) and argument ($\theta$ )instead as a function of the co-ordinates, then my 'angluar' derivative is the partial derivative of the function w.r.t $\theta$ and my 'modular' derivative is the partial derivative of the function w.r.t. $|z|$. Together, both my angular and modular derivatives can get from value of the function to another. For example, let $f(|z|,\theta)$ be a complex function. Let it's partial derivative w.r.t $\theta$ be $a(|z|,\theta)$ and the partial derivative w.r.t $|z|$ be $m(|z|,\theta)$. Let $z_1$ and $z_2$ be two points.

Problem is, how do we evaluate that limit? If we substitute $w=z+h$, then that's the same thing as approaching $z$ from the right along the line parallel to the the real axis passing through $z$. If we substitute $w=z+ih$, then that's the same as approaching $z$ from upward along the line parallel to the imaginary axis passing through $z$. If we substitute $w=z+h(cos45+isin45)$, then that's the same as approaching $z$ from North-East along the line passing through $z$ and inclined 45 degrees to the real axis.

There are three possibilities. Firstly, zero is a removable singularity, so we can remove zero and the resulting function is entire, and thus the result follows, by Liouville's theorem. Secondly, if zero is an essential singularity, then by Casorati-Weierstrass theorem we have that the image of f is dense so the result follows.

Any help would be appreciated.","Assume that f is a holomorphic function on except at the origin. Also, suppose that for each positive integer n. Prove that . Now, we know that is the only singular point of . There are three possibilities. Firstly, zero is a removable singularity, so we can remove zero and the resulting function is entire, and thus the result follows, by Liouville's theorem. Secondly, if zero is an essential singularity, then by Casorati-Weierstrass theorem we have that the image of f is dense so the result follows.

Show that the set of complex number $z$ satisfying $\left|\dfrac{z-a}{1-\bar a z}\right|=r$ is a circle in complex plane. Find the centre and radius of this circle. By putting $z=x+iy$ and $a=a_1+ia_2$ and then simplifying I got the result, but the process is too lengthy.

I rewrote the equation using $\cos$ and $\sin$ and solved the resulting two equations (one was luckily always true) with a case by case analysis.
