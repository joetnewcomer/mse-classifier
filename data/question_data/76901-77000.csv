5,Proof of Homotopy Lemma in Milnor's Book,Proof of Homotopy Lemma in Milnor's Book,,"In Topology from the Differentiable Viewpoint by Milnor the ""Homotopy Lemma"" is stated as follows Homotopy Lemma: Let $f, g : M \to N$ be smoothly homotopic maps between manifolds of the same dimension, where $M$ is compact and without boundary. If $y \in N$ is a regular value for both $f$ and $g$, then $$\#f^{-1}(y) = \#g^{-1}(y) \ \ \ \text{(mod $2$)}$$ Now when proving this Milnor let's $F : M \times [0, 1] \to N$ be a smooth homotopy between $f$ and $g$. He then supposes that $y \in N$ is a regular value for $F$. I won't write out the details here , but he proceeds to show that $\# f^{-1}(y) = \# g^{-1}(y) \ \ (\text{mod} \ 2)$. In the next part of the proof he supposes that $y \in N$ is not a regular value for $F$ and shows again that $\# f^{-1}(y) = \# g^{-1}(y) \ \ (\text{mod} \ 2)$ (using the result from the first part of the proof). Now I'm assuming that Milnor must have proved something stronger, that for any point $y \in N$, $\#f^{-1}(y) = \# g^{-1}(y) \ \ (\text{mod} \ 2)$, because any point $y \in N$ is either a regular value for $F$ or it is not a regular value for $F$, and both cases would be covered by the proof above. But then that leads me to question the following. Is $y \in N$ a regular value for both $f$ and $g$ if and only if $y \in N$ is a regular value for $F$? I'm not sure exactly how to prove this at the moment, or to provide a counterexample, but if the reverse direction holds, then the Homotopy Lemma would be proved. Does the reverse direction hold, do both directions hold, or does neither? Finally is my assumption that Milnor proved something stronger correct? If so why hasn't Milnor stated this stronger result in the book instead of the weaker version. If my assumption is not correct, then how has Milnor actually proved the Homotopy Lemma without actually assuming $y \in N$ is a regular value for both $f$ and $g$? Edit : Actually I just realized that in the second part of the proof $y$ is supposed to be not a regular value of $F$, but it is a regular value for $f$, otherwise $\# f^{-1}(y)$ wouldn't even be defined (in the proof on page 22).

(The claim is thus $\mathbb{S}^2 \cong \mathbb{\bar{B}}^2/ {\sim}$) Now my intuition failed me here, because the Torus, $\mathbb{T}^2$, which is used as the prototypical example to demonstrate the power and simplicity of quotient spaces, where ""gluing"" ends of a square to form first a cylinder, and then finally a torus make sense. That ""gluing"" intuition didn't work for me in this case, if anything by that argument the quotient space we'd end up with above would be a semi-circle sitting in $\mathbb{R}^2$. But to prove this claim the book explicitly constructs a quotient map $f : \mathbb{\bar{B}}^2 \to \mathbb{S}^2$ where $f$ is a rather involved function, and since $f$ makes the same identitifcations, namely being that on the boundary of the disk we have $f(x, y) = f(-x, y)$, and by the uniqueness of quotient space we prove our claim.

Which is for any quotient space $X /{\sim}$ there is a quotient map say $f$ (which is not the canonical mapping $q : X \to X / {\sim}$ defined by $q(x) = [x]$, sending an element to its equivalence class), which makes the same identifications as the equivalence relation. We then then appeal to the uniqueness of quotient spaces, and because $f$ makes the same identifications as $q$, we have $f[X] = X /{\sim}$.

Let $X$ be a non-empty set with topologies $T_1$ and $T_2$ such that $T_1 \subset T_2$. Let $p_n$ be a sequence of points of $X$, and let $p \in X$. Then we have the following: If $p_n $ converges to $p$ in the topology $T_2$, then $p_n$ converges to $p$ in the topology $T_1$ also. In other words, if $p_n$ fails to converge to $p$ in $T_1$, then $p_n$ fails to converge to $p$ in $T_2$ also. Am I right? Also, the product and uniform topologies on $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ are the metric topologies induced by the metrics $D$ and $\tilde{\rho}$, respectively, on $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ defined as follows:  $$D\left( x, y \right) = \sup \left\{ \ \frac{ \min \left\{ \left\vert x_n - y_n \right\vert, 1 \right\}  }{n} \ \colon \ n \in \mathbb{N} \  \right\}$$  and  $$\tilde{\rho}\left( x, y \right) = \sup \left\{ \ \min \left\{ \left\vert x_n - y_n \right\vert, 1 \right\} \ \colon \ n \in \mathbb{N} \ \right\}$$ for all $x = \left(x_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ and  $y = \left( y_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ in $\mathbb{R}^\omega$. Am I right? Moreover, in a metric space, every convergent sequence is Cauchy; so every non-Cauchy sequence in a metric space fails to converge. We can also state and prove the following. Let $p_n = \left( \xi_{n1}, \xi_{n2}, \xi_{n3}, \ldots \right)$ be a sequence of points in $\mathbb{R}^\omega$, and let $p = \left( \xi_1, \xi_2, \xi_3, \ldots \right)$ be a point of $\mathbb{R}^\omega$. Suppose that $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ is given the product topology. Then the sequence $p_n$ converges to $p$ in $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ if and only if, for each $j \in \mathbb{N}$, the sequence $\left( \xi_{nj} \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ converges to $\xi_j$ in $\mathbb{R}$. Am I right? If so, can we extend the above result (or part of it) to the uniform and the box topologies on $\mathbb{R}^\omega$? If the last result I've stated is correct, then in the product topology on $\mathbb{R}^\omega$, all of the given sequences can only converge to the point $\mathbf{0} = (0, 0, 0, \ldots)$. So none of these sequences can converge to a point distinct from $\mathbf{0}$ in either the uniform or the product topology. Am I right? Now for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we have $$D\left( w_n , \mathbf{0} \right) = \frac 1 n \to 0 \ \mbox{ as } \ n \to \infty, $$ showing that $w_n$ does converge to $\mathbf{0}$ in the product topology. Am I right? However, in the uniform metric, we have $$\tilde{\rho}\left(w_n, \mathbf{0} \right) = 1$$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, showing that $w_n$ cannot converge to $\mathbf{0}$ and hence $w_n $ cannot converge to any other point of $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ either. Therefore $w_n$ cannot converge to any point of $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ in the box topology either. Am I right? For each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we have $$D\left( x_n , \mathbf{0} \right) = \frac{1}{n^2} \to 0 \ \mbox{ as } \ n \to \infty,$$ showing that $x_n$ converges to $\mathbf{0}$ in the product topology. Am I right? For each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we have $$ \tilde{\rho}\left( x_n, \mathbf{0} \right) = \frac 1 n \to 0 \  \mbox{ as } \ n \to \infty,$$ which shows that $x_n$ converges to $\mathbf{0}$ in the uniform topology also. Am I right? Now there is no $x_n$ in the box topology basis element $$ \left(- \frac{1}{1^3}, \frac{1}{1^3} \right) \times \left( - \frac{1}{2^3}, \frac{1}{2^3} \right) \times \left( - \frac{1}{3^3}, \frac{1}{3^3} \right) \times \left( \frac{1}{4^3}, \frac{1}{4^3} \right) \times \cdots $$ containing $\mathbf{0}$. So $x_n$ cannot converge in the box topology. Am I right? For each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we have  $$\tilde{\rho}\left( y_n, \mathbf{0} \right) = \frac 1 n \to 0 \ \mbox{ as } \ n \to \infty,$$  which implies that $y_n$ converges to $\mathbf{0}$ in the uniform topology and hence also in the product topology. Am I right? However, there is no $y_n$ in the box topology basis element $$\left(- \frac 1 2, \frac 1 2 \right) \times \left(- \frac 1 3, \frac 1 3 \right) \times \left(- \frac 1 4, \frac 1 4 \right) \times \cdots$$ containing $\mathbf{0}$, thus showing that $y_n$ cannot converge in the box topology. Am I right? Let $$ \left( a_1, b_1 \right) \times \left( a_2, b_2 \right) \times \left( a_3, b_3 \right) \times \cdots$$ be a box topology basis element containing $\mathbf{0}$. Then $a_j < 0 < b_j$ for each $j \in \mathbb{N}$. By the Archimedian property of real numbers, there are natural numbers $N_1$ and $N_2$ such that $b_1 N_1 > 1$ and $b_2 N_2 > 1$. Let $N$ be a natural number such that $N \geq \max \left\{ N_1, N_2 \right\}$. Then $$z_n \in  \left( a_1, b_1 \right) \times \left( a_2, b_2 \right) \times \left( a_3, b_3 \right) \times \cdots$$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n > N$, from which it follows that $z_n$ converges to $\mathbf{0}$ in the box topology. Hence $z_n$ converges to $\mathbf{0}$ in both the uniform and the product topology also. Am I right? Have I been able to get the correct conclusions? If not, where have I erred? If yes, then can we determine the convergence of these sequences using only the machinery developed by Munkres up to this point in the book?

Determine the closures of the intervals $A=(0,\sqrt{2})$ and $B=(\sqrt{2},3)$ in these two topologies. Attempted Solution （I shall use $A'$ to denote the set of limit points of set $A$ ） In $\T_{1}$ , we claim that $\overline{\left(0,\sqrt{2}\right)}=[0,\sqrt{2})$ . To show this, we first show that $\left\{ 0\right\} $ is a limit point of $\left(0,\sqrt{2}\right).$ Let $U$ be any open set containing in $\left\{ 0\right\} $ , then $\exists[a,b)$ such that $\left\{ 0\right\} \in[a,b)\subset U.$ Therefore, $\exists\varepsilon>0$ such that $[0,\varepsilon)\in[a,b),$ which implies $U\cap\left(0,\sqrt{2}\right)\neq\emptyset$ . Since $U$ is arbitrary, we have that $\left\{ 0\right\} \in\left(0,2\right)'$ . Then we have $[0,\sqrt{2})\subset\overline{\left(0,\sqrt{2}\right)}.$ To see the other direction, it suffices to show that $[0,\sqrt{2})$ is closed. Indeed, $[0,\sqrt{2})^{c}=\left(-\infty,0\right)\cup[\sqrt{2},+\infty)=\cup_{n=1}^{\infty}\left[[-n,0)\cup[\sqrt{2},n)\right]$ which is open and thus $[0,\sqrt{2})$ is closed and contains $\left(0,\sqrt{2}\right)$ . Then by definition, $\overline{\left(0,\sqrt{2}\right)}\subset[0,\sqrt{2})$ . By virtually the same argument, we can show that $\overline{\left(\sqrt{2},3\right)}=[\sqrt{2},3)$ . In $\T_{2}$ , we claim that $\overline{\left(0,\sqrt{2}\right)}=\left[0,\sqrt{2}\right].$ Using a similar argument, we can show that $\left\{ 0\right\} \in\left(0,\sqrt{2}\right)'$ . To show that $\left\{ \sqrt{2}\right\} \in\left(0,\sqrt{2}\right)'$ , we note that for any open set $U$ containing $\left\{ \sqrt{2}\right\} $ , $\exists[a,b)\in U$ such that $a<b$ and $a,b\in\Q.$ This guarantees that $a<\sqrt{2}$ since $\sqrt{2}\notin\Q$ . Thus $U\cap\left(0,\sqrt{2}\right)\neq\emptyset.$ Since $U$ is arbitrary, $\sqrt{2}\in\left(0,\sqrt{2}\right)'$ . We then have $\left[0,\sqrt{2}\right]\in\overline{\left(0,\sqrt{2}\right)}.$ To see this other direction, it suffices to show that $\left[0,\sqrt{2}\right]$ is closed. To see this, we note that we can rewrite $[0,\sqrt{2}]^{c}=\cup_{n=1}^{\infty}\left[[-n,0)\cup[a_{n},+\infty)\right]$ where $a_{n}\in\Q$ for all $n\in\N,$ and $a_{n}\downarrow\sqrt{2}.$ Notice that the latter is open as it's a countable union of open sets in $\T_{2}$ , whence $[0,\sqrt{2}]$ is closed, and as a result $\overline{\left(0,\sqrt{2}\right)}\subset[0,\sqrt{2}]$ . By a similar argument, we can show that $\overline{\left(\sqrt{2},3\right)}=[\sqrt{2},3)$ Question I don't know if my arguments are convincing enough.

97,Can a metric subspace be completely covered by balls after a finite number of steps?,Can a metric subspace be completely covered by balls after a finite number of steps?,,"Let $X$ me a metric space with distance $d$ and $A$ be a subspace of $X$ . Let $B_\varepsilon(x)$ be the open ball centered in $x$ with radius $\varepsilon$ , i.e. $\{y\in X\mid d(x,y) < \varepsilon\}$ . Let $B_\varepsilon(S) = \displaystyle\bigcup_{x\in S} B_\varepsilon(x)$ Let $S_0:=\{x_i\}_{i\in I_0}$ be a set of points such that: $x_i\in A\quad \forall i\in I_0$ . $B_\varepsilon(x_i)\cap B_\varepsilon(x_j) = \emptyset\quad \forall i\neq j$ If $x\in A\setminus S_0$ then $\exists i\in I_0$ such that $B_\varepsilon(x)\cap B_\varepsilon(x_i) \neq \emptyset$ (In other words, I'm taking a maximal set of points of $A$ so that any two are separated by $2\varepsilon$ or more) At this point if $A\setminus B_\varepsilon(S_0) \neq \emptyset$ then we create: $S_1:=\{x_i\}_{i\in I_1}$ such that: $x_i\in A\quad \forall i\in I_1$ . $B_\varepsilon(x_i)\cap B_\varepsilon(x_j) = \emptyset\quad \forall i\neq j$ If $x\in A\setminus(S_0\cup S_1)$ then $\exists i\in I_1$ such that $B_\varepsilon(x)\cap B_\varepsilon(x_i) \neq \emptyset$ (In other words, I'm taking a maximal set of points of $A\setminus B_\varepsilon(S_0)$ so that any two are separated by $2\varepsilon$ or more) At this point, if $A\setminus B_\varepsilon(S_0\cup S_1)\neq \emptyset$ then we create $S_2$ in a similar way. If $B_\varepsilon(S_0\cup S_1\cup S_2)$ does not cover $A$ we construct $S_3$ and so forth. The questions are: Given $\varepsilon > 0$ can we ensure that this process will finish after a finite amount of steps? If so, is there an upper bound of said ampunt of steps? A small example. Consider $X = A = \mathbb{R}$ with the euclidean distance. Consider any $\varepsilon > 0$ . Then let $k$ be the smallest integer such that $k\varepsilon \geq 1$ . This means that $S_0$ has a countable amount of points. We can order the points of $S_0$ acording to the usual total order $\leq$ of $\mathbb{R}$ . In this case, $2\varepsilon < d(x_n,x_{n+1}) < 4\varepsilon$ . In other words, the diameter of any conex subset of $\mathbb{R}\setminus B_\varepsilon (S_0)$ is less than $2\varepsilon$ (otherwise we could fit another ball in there) In the next iteration we create $S_1 = \{y_i\}$ where $x_n < y_n < x_{n+1}$ and $\varepsilon < d(x_n,y_n) < 3\varepsilon$ and $\varepsilon < d(y_n,x_{n+1}) < 3\varepsilon$ . In other words,  the diameter of any conex subset of $\mathbb{R}\setminus B_\varepsilon (S_0\cup S_1)$ is less than $\varepsilon$ . This means that when we put the points of $S_2$ in said connex subsets (one in each) then $\mathbb{R}\setminus B(S_0\cup S_1\cup S_2) = \emptyset$ . Thus three steps are sufficient to cover $\mathbb{R}$ with balls of any radius $\varepsilon$ .","Let me a metric space with distance and be a subspace of .

98,Why is $Gal(\Omega/k)$ a topological group under the Krull topology?,Why is  a topological group under the Krull topology?,Gal(\Omega/k),"For an infinite Galois extension $\Omega/k$ the Krull topology on $G:=Gal(\Omega/k)$ is defined by taking as a basis for the neighbourhood of an element $\sigma \in G$ all cosets of the form $\sigma Gal(\Omega/K)$ as $K$ runs through all finite Galois extensions of $k$ which are contained in $\Omega$. In showing that the group operations of $G$ turn it into a topological group one has to show that the multiplication is continuous. This amounts to proving that for any two elements $\sigma,\tau \in G$ and a finite extension $K$ as above one has $$ \sigma Gal(\Omega/K)\tau Gal(\Omega/K) \subseteq \sigma \tau Gal(\Omega/K).$$ This is then equivalent to showing that $\tau^{-1}Gal(\Omega/K)\tau \subseteq Gal(\Omega/K)$ but I cannot think of a proof of this.
