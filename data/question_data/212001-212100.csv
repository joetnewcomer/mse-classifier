I asked a related question about division around a modulus here: https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/250811/undoing-an-integer-wraparound# and was told about the multiplicative inverse. Does a similar thing exist for remainder operations? For example, if we evaluate the function with values $x = 193492627$ and $c = 98$, we get $h = 2090289493$ (because h is $\mod2^{32}$). Is there an operation $\Omega$ such that $ (h\;\Omega\;33)=32$? (The result being $32$ because $98 \equiv 32 \pmod{33}$) Here's an example of what I can do, in a case where $h$ has not wrapped. $h = 177676$ $y = h\mod{33} = 4$ Values of $c$ where $4\equiv c\mod{33}$: $70$ and $103$ I can now pursue only those two values of $c$. (Find the values of $x$ that correspond to them, etc) Here's an example of the same algorithm above, but in a case where $h$ has wrapped: $h = 2090289493$ $y = h\mod{33} = 28$ <-- Incorrect! Should be 32 Here is an example of the algorithm using the operation $\Omega$ and an $h$ that has wrapped. This is what I'd like to do, but I don't know what operation $\Omega$ represents. $h = 2090289493$ $y = h\ \Omega\ {33} = 32$ Values of $c$ where $32\equiv c\mod{33}$: $65$ and $98$ I can now pursue only those two values of $c$.",,"['number-theory', 'discrete-mathematics', 'modular-arithmetic']"

So I set $F(\vec{X}^*)=D(\vec{X}^*)-\vec{X}^*$ and implemented an algorithm for minimization, and it seems to work well at finding fixed points. Stability analysis is as simple as checking that all the eigenvalues are within the unit circle. However, in some cases the system in question produces limit cycles. Since I am mostly experienced with Continuous Time Dynamical Systems I guessed by analogy that the minimum found by the steepest decent algorithm found the 'center' of the cycle. In retrospect, this seems exceedingly unlikely. My questions: 1.Is this intuition correct at least in some cases, i.e. can I expect some fixed point $\vec{X}_c$ that is the 'center' of the cycle? If so, in which cases? 2.If this is the case, can I identify it as a center (as opposed to some other stable or unstable fixed point) by the eigenvalues or by some other method? 3.If this is not the case, how can I identify cases in which the system cycles?

If G is degree-constrained, then there is a matching that covers L. Proof. The proof is by contradiction. Suppose that G is degree constrained but that there is no matching that covers L.

43,Iteratively Replacing Substrings,Iteratively Replacing Substrings,,"This problem came up while I was helping someone. Informally, we have a string of characters and a ""rule"" which replaces a specific string with another one, and we repeat this rule until we can no longer do so (obviously if you replace a string with another which contains the first as a substring, this won't terminate). The question is, under what conditions will this terminate, and is there a general bound on the length of the resulting string? Specifically, let's try this with two characters, $a$ and $b,$ and let's assume there's only one rule. As an example, consider the rule $ab \mapsto bba.$ It isn't hard to see for a string of length $n,$ the maximum length of the resulting string is $2^{n-1} + n -1.$ The point here is that this rule essentially moves all $a$'s to the right (and it doesn't change the number of $a$'s), so the most it can do is double the number of $b$'s for each $a.$ A string which achieves this upper bound is $aaa\ldots ab.$ Another question is, why is it true that the order of replacement doesn't matter (this shouldn't be too hard, assuming it terminates... I think)?","This problem came up while I was helping someone.

48,A real world problem I have encountered in my work (Not a book!) - opcode allocation,A real world problem I have encountered in my work (Not a book!) - opcode allocation,,"""here's a word size, here is a list of data bits of an instruction, and their relative frequencies, allocate them as best you can"" Tags were a guess, sorry. I find this problem to be VERY interesting, I'm not sure what I expect as an answer but I want at the very least to share it. Terminology A bit is a binary digit , a 0 or a 1. A word is a collection of bits (for this application 8 of them, this may be called a byte or sometimes char ) An instruction is a number of words such that the first m bits unambiguously identify the instruction (there will be examples), the remaining bits may be data or ignored. A register is a number of words ""inside the machine"" that instructions can operate on and use data from. (there will always be at least 4 registers, due to the four colour theorem) A subregister is a continuous partition of a register and is a number of words in length. The memory is a strip of words starting at 0 to some finite limit. The size of a register is what subregister we wish to use A general purpose register is a register used for manipulating data, not the flow of the program or manipulating structures of the program (eg stack) Examples to understand terminology x86_64 registers This is a real world example, in the CPU of the computer you are reading this on is a register called ""a"", it is 64 bits (8 bytes) long. rax address the full 64 bits, eax addresses the lower 32 bits, ax the lower 16, al the lower 8 and ah the upper 8 of ax , as a diagram: register a (the numbers below are bytes) |   7   |   6   |   5   |   4   |   3   |   2   |   1   |   0   | |                          rax                                  |                                 |               eax             |                                                 |      ax       |                                                 |  ah   |  al   | So al is a subregister of ax . Instructions Suppose I want to move the contents of register X into register Y , we denote this by the assembly instruction: MOV X,Y , we move into X the value of Y. However using a and b registers from the _x86 example above: MOV a,b means copy the contents of b into a, but what parts of b and a? MOV rax,rbx makes sense, clearly this means copy the 64 bits of b into a. MOV eax,ebx means copy the lowest 32 bits of b into a. Clearly the sizes must be the same for the MOV instruction. Defining an instruction Suppose we have 4 registers, a , b , c and d . Suppose also we have 4 sizes, 64 bits, lower 32, lower 16 and lower 8. we may express a register as 2 bits, ( 00 01 10 and 11 respectively) We may also express a size as 2 bits (the same as above respectively) So MOV GP,GP where ""GP"" means ""general purpose register"" has 6 bits of data, target register, source register and size. Recall that an instruction is a number of words, this means (I will use word size as 8 in all examples) to fit in one word the first 2 bits must uniquely and unambiguously define MOV. If we can't do this then we must use 16 bits (2 words) and this means 8 bits are ignored. this is inefficient and what is to be minimised Worked example problem Suppose we have the following instruction set MOV GP,GP - Copy the contents of the second register into the first. MOV [GP],GP - Copy the value of the second register into the memory location given by the first. ( example MOV [rax],ebx sets the memory location rax to the first byte of of ebx , the memory location rax+1 to the second byte of ebx , all the way to rax+3 being the final byte of the 4 byte register ebx.) This requires 2 registers and a size (it must be [rax] for this machine in the example because a memory address is 64 bits, the amount of data to copy into memory is given purely by the right hand register) MOV GP,[GP] - Copy the value of the memory location given by the second register into the first register ( example MOV ax,[rdx] means copy the memory value at rdx to the lower byte of a and copy the memory value at rdx+1 to the second lowest byte of a ) HALT - this signals the end of the program and shuts down the machine (it doesn't execute any more instructions after this) NOP - short for no op, it literally means do nothing. This is what your processor does when idle. A naive attempt MOV GP,GP has 6 bits of data MOV [GP],GP has 6 bits of data MOV GP,[GP] has 6 bits of data HALT has 0 bits of data NOP has 0 bits of data Let us also consider an instruction frequency , higher indicates more frequent and lower indicates less frequent, is is simply a ranking (an integer value). Clearly the first 3 will be very common instructions and the last 2 will be very uncommon, it makes sense to allocate them like so: MOV a,b   -->  00aabbss (ss is size) MOV [a],b -->  01aabbss  MOV a,[b] -->  10aabbss HALT      -->  1100xxxx (x = ignored) NOP       -->  1101xxxx  (unused)  -->  1110 (unused)  -->  111100 (unused)  -->  111101 You can see the pattern forming I hope, you'll also note this is unambiguous, if one were to allocate binary numbers for these you will note HALT would be 100vwxyz (4) (where HALT would ignore vwxyz) However this would be interpreted as MOV into register 0v the yz sized block of data starting at the location in memory given by register wx Hence my simple pattern. The above example was simple to solve regardless. Where it becomes complex Suppose we have some more instructions: ADD GP,GP - Add to the LHS register the contents of the RHS register (6 bits of data, a lower frequency than any MOV, 2 registers and a size) INC GP - increment register by 1 (4 bits of data, register and size) DEC GP - like INC but decreases a register's value by 1 (4 bits of data) SET GP,mask,value - mask and value are 8 bits each, for each 1 in the mask set the corresponding byte in GP to the 8 bits given in value. so SET GP,11111111,00000000 sets an entire register to 0 - 18 bits of data (2+8+8) MUL GP,GP - Another 6 data bit, same format as ADD NEG GP - negates the integer value of GP (4 data bits) PUSH GP - 4 data bits, register and size POP GP - 4 data bits, register and size You can see that the moment we have more than 3 things with the same amount of data something has to spill and it might displace something else. My question is, what is the best way to allocate a set of operations? This boils down (hopefully now you see how/why) ""How can I create a word length * n string of binary digits that uniquely defines an operation with n data bits where the least number of bits are ignored and equally eligible operations are ranked based on their relative frequency."" At first glance this appears VERY similar to box packing, and it almost is, the constraint of minimising the number of words for an instruction is important however. One of my earliest attempts was to put this in a spreadsheet and order by data bits, this works for instructions that want to share the same instruction length, but can unfairly place (for example) the SET instruction last, even though it'd nicely fit in a 24 bit (3 byte) instruction.

(subtraction, isn't valid but seems logical to me atm) $$\sum_{i=1}^k(2i-1) + 2k - 1$$ Also, could someone please point me in the right direction on how to accomplish this conversion: $$k^2+2k+1 = (k+1)^2$$ Thank you in advance for helping me find the sources on how to understand everything until page 18 (out of 180 ^_^)",,['discrete-mathematics']

The players are divided into a number of teams, and each round consists of the matches between these teams. The type of schedule I would like to make should conform to Balanced-Tournament Design.  This means: each team plays at each location Sometimes, locations are not always equal.  For example, the centre court at Wimbledon.  A balanced tournament should let everyone play at every location a fair number of times. each team plays every other team A staple of most round robin tournaments each team is ""home"" and ""away"" and equal number of times In team sports, often there needs to be a home and away team.  In baseball, for example, the home team gets to bat last in each inning.  This can be an advantage, so a balanced tournament should let every team have this opportunity an equal number of times. I've had a lot of success using Orthogonal Latin Squares and Factored Balanced Tournament Design, and found a decent way to generate such tournaments. However, I would like to now do something a little different: Players are grouped (e.g. based on skill or position).  A team needs one player of each group (e.g. one player of each position or skill level) Each round, the teams and matches are recreated such that The number of times two people play with each other is minimized The number of times two people play against each other is minimized This is similar to Individual-Pairs tournaments, but in my problem, the teams can have more than 2 players and the players are grouped such that each team requires a player from each group.  By changing the teams each round, a single player from each group (e.g. position or skill level) can ""win"" the tournament by winning more games than any other player. More formally, this could be described as follows (I am open to changing this notation should anyone have a better way to represent this): There are p players, divided up into g groups, each consisting of t=p/g players. Groups of players are labelled Gi={Pi1, Pi2, ... Pit} where i is the number of the group ( 0<=i<=g ) All players in this group are the same position/skill level, so a team will have exactly one player from each group. Players are labelled Pij where i is the group the player belongs to ( 0<=i<=g ) j is the number of the player within group i ( 0<=j<=t ) The schedule will contain r=t-1 rounds This will let everyone play against everyone else within their group.
