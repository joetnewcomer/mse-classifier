3,Selecting a menu,Selecting a menu,,"While perusing old unanswered puzzle questions, I came across this one . I found it quite interesting, but a bit vague, so I've decided to recast it. A party is to be held at a restaurant. The restaurant has the ability to make $D$ different dishes, but the menu for the party will be a fixed menu featuring just $d$ dishes, where $d < D$ . To select which dishes should be on the menu, the $n$ guests are asked to rank all D dishes. For which values of $D$ , $d$ and $n$ is it always possible to select $d$ dishes such that for any dish $k$ not on the menu, more than half the guests would prefer one of the dishes in the menu over dish $k$ ? Let's look at a concrete example. Suppose the number of possible dishes was $D=10$ , the number of selected dishes was $d=3$ and the number of guests was $n=10$ . The worst possible ranking I can think of (though I'm not sure it is the worst) is shown below: The ranks are spread out so no guest ranks any dish the same. I now selected the $3$ dishes marked in green so that the ranks of $1,2, 3$ were distributed among the guests as much as possible. Thus, only guest $10$ does not have one of the selected dishes in his top $3$ . If you now go through each of the unselected dishes, you will see that in every case a majority of the guests will have a higher ranked dish among the $3$ selected dishes. So (assuming my worst case actually is the worst case!) with these values of $D$ , $d$ and $n$ , it is always possible to select such a menu. Any input as to whether a worse case ranking is possible, would also be appreciated. EDIT - Partial results After fiddling with this question, I realize I should probably have asked ""Given $n$ and $D$ , what is the minimum required $d$ to fulfill the constraint?"". Afterall, if a certain value of $d$ works, then so will any larger value of $d$ . My biggest problem, oddly, is how to know the worst possible ranking. To test conjectures, I need to test them against the worst case. But I'm not completely sure what that is, for a given $n$ and $D$ . Anyway, an initial result is that a menu is always possible if $d > \frac{n}{2}$ . A second tentative result is that if $n = D$ then $d = 2$ . E.g., if I select dish $1$ and $6$ in my example above, the constraint is fulfilled. But this implies that if a $1000$ people ranked a $1000$ dishes, it would still be possible to select $2$ dishes that fulfilled the constraint. This doesn't seem right. But if I use the ""worst case"" scenario which I used in my example above, this is the result I get. I'd appreciate if someone could post a counter-example. I suspect the problem is that my ""worst case"" is not the actual worst case. EDIT2 - Outragous! Further fiddling and computer simulation suggests the outragous claim that if $n \ge D$ then still $d = 2$ . This implies that if a $1,000$ dishes were ranked by a $1,000,000$ guests, we could always find just $2$ dishes which fulfilled the constraint! I must be doing something wrong. As usual, counter-examples would be greatly appreciated. EDIT3 So I've now done $10,000$ simulations with $30$ dishes and $60$ guests, where the guests ranked the dishes randomly, and in every case a menu of just $2$ dishes was sufficient. My confidence that $2$ dishes will always be sufficient for $n \ge D$ grows. :-) But a proof or counter-example would be nice.

The question is: what is the smallest number of vertices needed to represent a surface of genus $n$ in $\Bbb R^3$?

Labelling this as $f(n)$, this example shows that $f(1)\le9$ and obviously $f(0)=4$ (a tetrahedron is topologically equivalent to a sphere, and nothing smaller is non-planar.

Can you generalize these two examples to an $n$-genus solid and get a bound on $f(n)$? Lower bounds seem quite hard to prove, though. Edit in response to some of the comments: I believe that this problem can be tackled purely combinatorially, as my answer below hints at. The question boils down to this: Given a set $F$ of ""oriented"" three-element sets (i.e. ordered only up to cyclic permutation), define $V=\bigcup F$ and $E$ as the set of two-element subsets of some $f\in F$. This defines the set of vertices, edges, and faces. That this constitutes a polygon is the demand that every $\{e_1,e_2\}\in E$ is a subset of exactly two elements of $F$, once in the same direction as the cycle and once in the opposite direction, and the genus of the resulting surface can be calculated from $|V|-|E|+|F|=2-2g$. The orientation of elements of $F$ ensures that the resulting polygon is orientable, and then we can simply ask what is the smallest $k$ such that there exists such an arrangement with $|V|=k$ and $g=n$. This mapping is justified by the classification theorem for closed surfaces, which says that the above conditions imply that the polyhedron is homeomorphic to a set of disconnected multiple tori of various genuses. And noting that one can connect the pieces by replacing two triangles on each surface with a triangular prism (which lowers the overall Euler characteristic by $2$), we see that under the reasonable assumption that $f(n)$ is non-decreasing, it follows that any minimal $k$ satisfying the combinatorial assumptions must describe a connected $n$-torus, which was our original goal.","The image below shows a $9$-vertex polyhedron that is topologically equivalent to a torus, and hence has genus $1$.

10,Find a subset of a collection of vectors that sums to $0$,Find a subset of a collection of vectors that sums to,0,"Consider following practice problem on a handout from a previous year's Putnam seminar at MIT ( https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-a34-mathematical-problem-solving-putnam-seminar-fall-2018/ ). (Problem 100). Let $M_0$ be the $2^n \times n$ matrix whose rows consist of all $2^n$ distinct vectors of $\pm 1$ ’s (in some order) of length $n$ . Suppose that an arbitrary subset of the entries is changed to $0$ ’s. Show that some nonempty subset of the rows of the resulting matrix $M$ sums to the vector $[0, 0, . . . , 0]$ . Here are some observations I have made so far. Bounding the number of zeros . Suppose for a contradiction that there is some resulting matrix $M$ that has no nonempty subset of rows that sums to the zero vector. In the original matrix $M_0$ , pair each row with its negation, yielding $2^{n-1}$ pairs. For each associated pair of the matrix $M$ , there exists some column $j$ such that exactly one vector in the pair has $j$ -th entry equal to $0$ ; otherwise that pair would sum to zero. It follows that at least $2^{n-1}$ of the entries of $M$ are zero, and at least $2^{n-1}$ of the entries of $M$ are nonzero. Linear algebra . In vector notation, we want to show that there exists a vector $x \in \{0,1\}^{2^n}$ such that $x^T M = 0$ . The matrix $M$ has rank at most $n$ , so the set of all real $2^n$ -vectors $x$ satisfying this equation is a linear subspace with dimension at least $2^n - n$ . Perhaps we could control the coefficients of $x$ by considering an augmented equation $x^T [ M ~M'] = 0$ for some $2^n \times p$ matrix $M'$ that enforces relationships among the coefficients of $x$ . Alternatively, if we reduce everything modulo 2, then the set of vectors $x \in \mathbb{Z}_2$ satisfying $x^T M  = 0 \operatorname{mod} 2$ is also a linear subspace of dimension at least $2^n - n$ . In particular, it follows that there exists a nonempty subset of the rows of $M$ that sums to a vector in $(2 \mathbb{Z})^n$ . Parity . Calculations for small examples suggest that there is an odd number of zero-sum row subsets. This is clearly true in the extreme cases of $M = M_0$ and $M = 0$ . It would be sufficient to show that each time an entry is changed to $0$ , the parity of the number of nonempty zero-sum subsets is unchanged. In order to count these zero-sum subsets, it is natural to consider the (formal) function $$ f(z_1, \ldots, z_n) = \prod_{i =1}^{2^n} \bigl( 1 + z_1^{m_{i1}} \cdots z_n^{m_{in}} \bigr) = 1 + \sum_{A} \prod_{j=1}^{n} z_j^{ \sum_{i \in A} m_{ij} }, $$ where the sum is taken over all nonempty subsets $A$ of $\{1,\ldots, 2^n\}$ . Induction. Write each row $i$ of $M$ as $r_i = (r_i^1, r_i^{-1})$ where $r_i^{-1}$ is an $(n-1)$ -vector. The result follows by induction if we can find disjoint nonempty subsets $I_1, \ldots, I_{2^{n-1}}$ of the rows of the matrix (many of which may be singletons) such that (a) $\sum_{i \in I_k} r_i^1 = 0$ for each $k$ ; and (b) the $2^{n-1} \times (n-1)$ matrix with rows $R_k = \sum_{i \in I_k} r_i^{-1}$ for $k = 1, \ldots, 2^{n-1}$ takes the right form to apply the inductive hypothesis.

12,Is there an explicit construction of this bijection?,Is there an explicit construction of this bijection?,,"As part of my answer to another question , I needed the following fact: if $S = \{1, \ldots, n\}$ and $k \leq n/2$ , then there is a bijection $f : {S \choose k} \to {S \choose k}$ such that $t \cap f(t) = \emptyset$ for all $t \in {S \choose k}$ . Here $n$ and $k$ are positive integers, and ${S \choose k}$ denotes the family of all size- $k$ subsets of $S$ . Here's the proof I found for that fact. Let $p = \left\lvert{S \choose k}\right\rvert = {n \choose k}$ , and write ${S \choose k} = \{t_1, \ldots, t_p\}$ . Construct a bipartite graph $G$ on partite sets $A = \{a_1, \ldots, a_p\}$ and $B = \{b_1, \ldots, b_p\}$ by drawing an edge $a_ib_j$ whenever $t_i \cap t_j = \emptyset$ . Observe that $G$ is an ${n-k \choose k}$ -regular bipartite graph, where ${n-k \choose k} > 0$ , and therefore has a perfect matching $M$ , by Hall's Theorem. Now for each $i \in \{1, \ldots, p\}$ we have $a_ib_j \in M$ for exactly one value of $j$ , and we get the desired bijection just by taking $f(t_i) = t_j$ for the corresponding value of $j$ . Unfortunately, the proof above doesn't give an explicit construction of the bijection $f$ , which makes it hard to naturally use this bijection in a combinatorial proof. When $n = 2k$ , the function $f(t) = S-t$ is an easy example of a bijection with this property. Is there a nice explicit construction of such a bijection for general $k$ ? Some partial thoughts: it's tempting to try to build on the $n=2k$ case by modifying the function $f(t) = S-t$ , say by taking the function $f$ to be ""take the $k$ least elements of $S-t$ "", but it seems that the natural approaches to modifying that function end up failing to be injective (hence also fail to be surjective). For example, the "" $k$ least elements of $S-t$ "" function fails at $n=5$ and $k=2$ because it yields $f(\{3,4\}) = f(\{3,5\}) = \{1,2\}$ . When $k=1$ this is just asking for a derangement of $\{1, \ldots, n\}$ , and a function like $f(\{i\}) = \{i+1 \mod n\}$ works, where $x \mod n$ is the residue of $x$ modulo $n$ . When $k=2$ and $n \geq 4$ , I believe the following function works, where $\{x,y\} + i \mod n$ is shorthand for $\{x+i \mod n, y+i \mod n\}$ : $f(\{i, j\}) = \begin{cases} \{i, j\} + 2 \mod n, & \text{if $i-j \equiv \pm 1 \pmod{n}$} \\ \{i, j\} + 1 \mod n, & \text{otherwise.}\end{cases}$ This suggests that in a general construction, maybe we can just assign an integer $r_t$ for each $t \in {S \choose k}$ and use a map of the form $t \mapsto t+r_t \bmod{n}$ , with the values of $r_t$ chosen cleverly to ensure bijectivity and disjointness. However, this approach is doomed to fail when $t$ is a difference set for $\mathbb{Z}_n$ . To use an example of such a set due to Jungnickel, Pott, and Smith, when $n = 11$ and $t = \{1,3,4,5,9\}$ , it is easy to check that $t + r_t \mod 11$ intersects $t$ regardless of the choice of $r_t$ . So this approach cannot work in general either. Relevant external literature I've found so far: The $n = 2k+1$ case appears to have been solved by Kierstead and Trotter (1988) , in a superficially-different but equivalent formulation. Kai Jin (2019) refers to the problem of finding an explicit $1$ -factorization of the related ""bipartite Kneser graphs"" (equivalent to the graph $G$ described in the proof above) as a ""challenging open problem"", but we are only looking for an explicit description of one matching in a bipartite Kneser graph, not an entire $1$ -factorization.","As part of my answer to another question , I needed the following fact: if and , then there is a bijection such that for all .

In the case of $m=3$ , I managed to show that $n$ can be any natural of the form $1+7a+19b+37c$ , which covers all $n\ge71$ .

29,How many possible board states in 2048?,How many possible board states in 2048?,,"I recently found out about the famous 2048 game .  For those of you who don't know how it works, it consists on a 4x4 board on where tiles which are powers of 2 are placed. On every turn, you ""swipe"" the board in any of the four directions, and a 2 (90% chance) or a 4 (10% chance) are placed randomly in any of the blank spaces. If two adjacent tiles are of the same value $n$, they can be merged into a tile of value $2n$. The game starts with 14 blank spaces and 2 randomly placed tiles (following the same rules as above). I have written a considerably strong AI for it, but now I want to know how many possible different board states can be achieved (to see if the game can actually be mathematically solved). Knowing the highest tile achievable is $2^{17}$, this means each tile can be in exactly 18 distinct positions (including 'blank' or zero). This yields an upper bound of $18^{16}$ different possible board states. However, it is obvious that all positions can't be achieved (for example, a board filled of 16 tiles of the same value, or a number higher than 4 being 'isolated' from the rest. Also, only one $2^{17}$, three $2^{16}$s,  five $2^{15}$s, etc can exist at the same time on the board). Then, you can also take into account rotations and simmetries. For example, there are 480 starting positions, but if you group together those that are rotations and/or simmetries of each other, you end up with only 75 distinct and unique starting positions (computed with a simple script). Edit : the number of boards achieved after two turns I calculated and that appeared here was wrong.

While I do not known $f$ explicitly, I have a ""device"" located at the origin $(1,1)$ which can do the following: Given an even number $m$ , the device runs over all closed walks of length $m$ that start and end at the origin. After going through all possible walks, the device gives me a list of all sums of the values of $f$ along each of these walks (without saying which sum corresponds to which walk). This list could potentially have repetitions of course (if I get the same sum from more than one walk). To clarify, for me a closed walk of length $m$ is an ordered list of $m+1$ vertices, such that each two vertices in the list are adjacent to one another (and two lattice points are adjacent if they differ by 1 in exactly one of their components). In our case, the first and last vertices on the list are the origin. Here is an example (showing only part of the infinite lattice): Here, red points correspond to the value $1$ and blue points to the value $0$ . If I take $m=0$ , the only closed walk at the origin is the one starting and ending there without moving (and the sum along this walk is $1$ ), and so the device would return the list $(1)$ . This measurement allows me to deduce that $f(1,1)=1$ . If $m=2$ , I have two closed walks of length $2$ - going up and back, or going right and back. The list of sums along these walks are $(3, 2)$ (but again - I don't know which sums corresponds to which walk). Since I know that the value at the origin is $1$ , I can tell that either $f(1,2)=1, f(2,1)=0$ or vice versa. Personally I only care about $f$ up to reflection, so I'm fine with assuming WLOG the first option and continuing. The question is, can I continue this process in a way which will definitely allow me to recover $f$ at an arbitrary point away from the origin? (up to reflection) The difficulty comes from the fact that this list of sums becomes more and more complicated (you have more and more closed walks, and they are more complex). Since I know only sums (up to multiplicity) but not which closed walks a given sum corresponds to, it's hard to recover the value at a specific point. Even when looking at closed walks of length $m=6$ and more I am not sure how to recover the values of $f$ at each point (if that's even possible). So the question is - can this be done? Is there an algorithm? Will it help if I can add finitely many ""devices"" at points that I choose? (not just one at the origin) Hard mode - can you take the lattice $\mathbb Z^2$ ? Can you do this for dimension higher than $2$ ? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.","I have a binary function .

44,High School Combinatorics - I do not agree with the provided explanation,High School Combinatorics - I do not agree with the provided explanation,,"The proposed problem was the following (translated into English by me): ""A school has $16$ students interested in participating in a team competition. First, they must split themselves into $8$ pairs. Then, each of those pairs must choose (among themselves) someone to be their leader. Finally, two teams of $8$ students are formed by choosing $4$ pairs to compose the first team, which already locks the opposing team. Considering two teams to be equal if, and only if, they are composed of the same pairs (with pairs being equal if they are composed of the same students, with the same leader), in how many distinct ways can these $16$ students divide themselves into two teams of eight?"" Solution Provided (translated by me): First, compute the total amount of distinct pairs that can exist. This is clearly given by $C_{16,2} = \frac{16!}{14!2!} = 15\cdot8$ . Since each pair has two choices of leader, we also multiply by two, to obtain $16\cdot15 = 240$ Now, multiply the amount of distinct pairs by the total number of ways of choosing $4$ out of the $8$ formed pairs to obtain the final answer: $C_{8,4} \cdot 240 = \frac{8!}{4!4!} \cdot 240 = 70 \cdot 240 = 16800$ My issues: I don't believe that using $C_{16,2}$ makes any sense, as (in my mind) after you choose the first pair, you cannot choose any other pair that contains either of the students in the first one you chose (and so on). I also don't believe this number correctly represents the total amount of ways of forming 8 pairs under these conditions, which is the number that would make sense to use in place of $C_{16,2}$ (in my opinion). My attempt: We begin by computing the number of ways of constructing $8$ distinct pairs out of $16$ students. For the first pair, we have $16 \choose 2$ possible ways. For the second pair, $14\choose 2$ . And so on until the final pair which is $2 \choose 2$ . So the total number of ways of assembling 8 pairs out of 16 students seems to be given by: $\prod_{n=1}^{8}{2n \choose 2}$ Which works out quite nicely to $\frac{16!}{2^{8}}$ But this is not quite the number I am looking for yet. Since I don't actually care about the order of the pairs, I have to divide by $8!$ , since when multiplying them out like I did above, I consider choosing some pair $A$ before some pair $B$ different then choosing first $B$ and then $A$ , when it clearly is not. So, the final number works out to: $\frac{16!}{8!2^{8}}$ . Like it was done in the official solution, I must now multiply by $2^{8}$ , since each individual has two choices of leaders. This gives me the total number of ways of forming $8$ distinct pairs with leaders which is $\frac{16!}{8!}$ The conclusion is now the same as in the official solution: We now multiply by the amount of different ways of choosing $4$ out of the $8$ pairs. This gives: $\frac{16!}{8!}\cdot C_{8,4} = \frac{16!}{8!}\cdot\frac{8!}{4!4!} = \frac{16!}{4!4!}$ And finally, we must divide by two since choosing, for example, pairs $A,B,C,D$ (out of pairs $A,B,C,D,E,F,G$ ) or choosing $D,E,F,G$ makes no difference on the resulting two teams. So my final answer turns out to be $\frac{16!}{4!\cdot 4!\cdot 2}$ , which is not even close to the number obtained in the official one. The question: Which one (if any) is right, and why is the other one (or both) wrong?","The proposed problem was the following (translated into English by me): ""A school has students interested in participating in a team competition. First, they must split themselves into pairs. Then, each of those pairs must choose (among themselves) someone to be their leader. Finally, two teams of students are formed by choosing pairs to compose the first team, which already locks the opposing team. Considering two teams to be equal if, and only if, they are composed of the same pairs (with pairs being equal if they are composed of the same students, with the same leader), in how many distinct ways can these students divide themselves into two teams of eight?"" Solution Provided (translated by me): First, compute the total amount of distinct pairs that can exist. This is clearly given by . Since each pair has two choices of leader, we also multiply by two, to obtain Now, multiply the amount of distinct pairs by the total number of ways of choosing out of the formed pairs to obtain the final answer: My issues: I don't believe that using makes any sense, as (in my mind) after you choose the first pair, you cannot choose any other pair that contains either of the students in the first one you chose (and so on). I also don't believe this number correctly represents the total amount of ways of forming 8 pairs under these conditions, which is the number that would make sense to use in place of (in my opinion). My attempt: We begin by computing the number of ways of constructing distinct pairs out of students. For the first pair, we have possible ways. For the second pair, . And so on until the final pair which is . So the total number of ways of assembling 8 pairs out of 16 students seems to be given by: Which works out quite nicely to But this is not quite the number I am looking for yet. Since I don't actually care about the order of the pairs, I have to divide by , since when multiplying them out like I did above, I consider choosing some pair before some pair different then choosing first and then , when it clearly is not. So, the final number works out to: . Like it was done in the official solution, I must now multiply by , since each individual has two choices of leaders. This gives me the total number of ways of forming distinct pairs with leaders which is The conclusion is now the same as in the official solution: We now multiply by the amount of different ways of choosing out of the pairs. This gives: And finally, we must divide by two since choosing, for example, pairs (out of pairs ) or choosing makes no difference on the resulting two teams. So my final answer turns out to be , which is not even close to the number obtained in the official one.

Take the standard Pascal's Triangle $(\mod 2)$ and read out each row $r_n$ as binary, $x_n = \sum_{i=0}^n 2^{i}r_{n,i}$ then the first few rows read as 1, 3, 5, 15, 17, 51, 85, 255, 257, … These are either Fermat primes or products of Fermat primes!

Simplifying, this is $\frac{2r^2+n^2-2rn-n}{2}$, so I'm trying to show $$ \frac{2r^2+n^2-2rn-n}{2}\leq\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} $$ to get the contrapositive. The above is equivalent, if my algebra is correct, to showing $r\geq\frac{n-1}{n-r}$ for any $0\lt r\lt n$. This seems reasonable, but I can't quite show it. How would I do so?  Thanks. I'd also be happy to see a solution that doesn't necessarily make use of the hint.",,"['combinatorics', 'graph-theory', 'graph-connectivity']"

I am supposed to show the following combinatorial identity: $\sum\limits_{r=0}^n\binom{n}{r}\binom{m+r}{n}=\sum\limits_{r=0}^n\binom{n}{r}\binom{m}{r}2^r$. The algebraic way is to consider the coefficient of $t^m$ in the expansion of $(1+t)^n(1-t)^{-(n+1)}$. For $r\in\{0,1,\cdots,n\}$, we have the coefficient of $t^{n-r}$ in the expansion of $(1+t)^n$ to be equal to $\binom{n}{r}$, and the coefficient of $t^{m+r-n}$ in the expansion of $(1-t)^{-(n+1)}$ to be equal to $\binom{m+r}{n}$. By the addition and multiplication principles this will show that the coefficient of $t^m$ in the expansion of $(1+t)^n(1-t)^{-(n+1)}$ will be equal to $\sum\limits_{r=0}^n\binom{n}{r}\binom{m+r}{n}$. On the other hand, we note that $(1+t)^n(1-t)^{-(n+1)}=(1+\frac{2t}{1-t})^n(1-t)^{-1}=\sum\limits_{r=0}^n\binom{n}{r}2^rt^r(1-t)^{-(r+1)}$.

What I am thinking of, is to think of a way to prove this identity without the use of the generalized binomial series. I was trying to think of a combinatorial method to solve this problem. In particular, I was trying to prove the combinatorial identity as follows: Firstly, let us be given a class of $n$ boys and a class of $m$ girls, where $n\leq m$. Choose a team $A$ of $r$ boys, and choose a team $B$ of $r$ girls, and finally choose any subset (may be empty) of boys from $A$ to clean the classroom, where $r\in\{0,1,\cdots,n\}$. For each value of $r$, we see that there are $\binom{n}{r}$ choices for $A$, $\binom{m}{r}$ choices for $B$, and subsequently there are $2^r$ ways to choose a subset from $A$. In this way we get the number of ways to do so to be equal to the expression on the RHS of the identity. What I am struggling though, is to be able to count the number of desired ways in a way that will give me the expression on the LHS of the identity. I tried firstly to choose the boys to clean the classroom before choosing the sets $A$ and $B$, but I wound up with some messy expression that does not seem close to matching the expression on the LHS.

Since I am new to this topic, I am getting a bit lost in the literature and I don't really know where to look. I was thinking that something based on counting the length of the sides could work. For example, the following polyomino: has one 5-length side, two 2-length sides and five 1-length sides. So we could describe it with the following notation: $\{(5,1),(2,2),(1,5)\}\,$ , where the first number in parenthesis stands for the length of the side and the second one for the number of sides of that length. Then, all translations, rotations, reflections or glide reflections of this shape would result in the same description. Which is good. However, this doesn't work in general. For example, the following two different polyominoes: would result in the same description $\{(5,1), (3,1), (2,2), (1,6) \}$ . Probably, someone has already figured out a better way to do this, but, as I said, I am getting lost in the literature of the topic. Can anybody point me to the right direction? Update: Thanks for the useful suggestions in the comments. After some more research I found an interesting method, explained in the book ""Linknot: Knot Theory by Computer - S. Jablan, R. Sazdanovic"" , which works like this: Let's imagine the path of a ray of light (bold line in figure) in a polyomino with the borders consisting of mirrors, where in every border cell we place two-sided mirrors (bolder lines) perpendicular to the internal edges in their midpoints . After a series of reflections, the ray of light will describe a shape called self-avoiding curve. If we denote a reflection in a border mirror by 0, and a reflection in an internal mirror by 1, we have 0-1 words for polyominoes, where these words are cyclically equivalent (this means, could be red starting from any sign 0 or 1 and ending in it). For n = 1 we will have only one polyomino 0000, for n = 2 the polyomino 00010001, for n = 3 two polyominoes: 000101000101 and 000100100011, for n = 4 five of them: 0001010100010101, 0001010001100011, 001001001001, 0001001100010011, and 0001001010001011, etc. We can translate these symbols (or binary numbers) into hexadecimal numbers and assign one number to each polyomino, in order to establish one-to-one correspondence between the numbers and polyominoes. For example, this number can be the minimum of all cyclic-equivalent symbols (e.g. to the polyomino 00010001 correspond cyclically equivalent symbols 00100010, 01000100, 10001000 and the minimum of them is 00010001 = 11 in the hexadecimal system). Hence, we have a notation for polyominoes where exactly one number corresponds to every polyomino, and vice versa. This last part of the method is similar to what achille hui was suggesting in his ""dumb"" method, in the comments. I don't know how the efficiency of this approach compares to the efficiency of the ""dumb"" one, but I think it should be faster, since we are only considering the ""perimeter"" of the polyomino and forgetting about the cells in the inside (this could be a problem for polyominoes with holes, but for my application I am only interested in the outer perimeter, so it's not a big deal). However, I did not find a proof that in this notation ""exactly one number corresponds to every polyomino, and vice versa"" , even though it intuitively feels right. Update 2: To clarify, the reason why I want to label (or encode or hash , the difference is still not completely clear to me...) the polyominoes is because I have a code that simulates the evolution of a 2d system where the different states of the system can look like polyominoes (something like a cellular automaton ).

97,Number of $K_{10}$ always increases,Number of  always increases,K_{10},"Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph with $n\geq 10 $ vertices. Suppose that when we add any edge to $G$, the number of complete graphs $K_{10}$ in $G$ increases. Show that $|E|\geq 8n-36$. [Source: The probabilistic method, Alon and Spencer 3rd ed., p.12, problem 5] For the base case $n=10$, we know $G$ must have $44=8\cdot 10-36$ edges. We know every vertex in $G$ must have degree $\geq 8$; otherwise adding an edge connecting that vertex cannot increase the number of $K_{10}$. This gives $|E|\geq 4n$.","Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph with $n\geq 10 $ vertices. Suppose that when we add any edge to $G$, the number of complete graphs $K_{10}$ in $G$ increases.

98,Limiting growth ratio of $[x^n]f(x)^n$,Limiting growth ratio of,[x^n]f(x)^n,"Based on a few examples (mainly data from OEIS as well as a bit of theory) I've arrived at the following conjecture: Conjecture: Let $f(x)$ be analytic at $0$ and nonlinear, and let $[x^n]f(x)$ represent the coefficient of $x^n$ in its power series. Let $$\alpha:=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{[x^{n+1}]\left(f(x)^{n+1}\right)}{[x^n]\left(f(x)^n\right)}$$ assuming it exists. Then $f(x)-\alpha x$ has a double root. Here's one application of this conjecture. Let $P_n$ be the probability that if you roll an $n$ -sided die $n$ times, none of the outcomes appear more than three times. Then using the above conjecture with $f(x)=1+x+\frac{x^2}2+\frac{x^3}6$ , together with some generating function know-how, reveals that $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{P_{n+1}}{P_n}=0.97868\ldots=\frac{2.66032\dots}e$$ where $c=2.66032\dots$ is the unique real such that $(1+x+\frac{x^2}2+\frac{x^3}6)-cx$ has a double root. A discriminant calculation reveals that $c$ is algebraic: $8c^3-21c^2-2=0$ . (Note to anyone trying to verify this numerically: $P_{n+1}/P_n\cdot(1+\frac1n)^n$ converges faster, and then you can divide the result by $e$ .) Unfortunately, my analytic combinatorics-fu isn't strong enough for me to actually prove this conjecture, so I turn to Stack Exchange. Is this conjecture true, and if so, how can I prove it? PS. I leave it to the reader to verify that the location of the double root in question is also a root of $xf'(x)-f(x)$ . EDIT: In fact, $\alpha$ can also be described as a local extreme value of $f(x)/x$ . That might be a simpler way to describe it. PPS. This is a variation of the fact that if $\beta=\lim_{n\to\infty}[x^{n+1}]f(x)/[x^n]f(x)$ exists then its reciprocal is a pole of $f$ , that is, $f(1/\beta)=\infty$ . The simplest example of this is $f(x)=1/(1-bx)$ and $[x^n]f(x)=b^n$ . This observation is essentially the start of analytic combinatorics, if my understanding is right. EDIT: Actually, $1/\beta$ could be some type of singularity other than a pole; an example would be $f(x)=\sqrt{1-x}$ , which has a branch cut at $1/\beta=1$ .","Based on a few examples (mainly data from OEIS as well as a bit of theory) I've arrived at the following conjecture: Conjecture: Let be analytic at and nonlinear, and let represent the coefficient of in its power series.
