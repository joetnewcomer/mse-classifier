We partition $S$ into two sets $A$ and $B$, each of size $n-1$.

Every man shakes hands with everyone except himself and his spouse. Half of the women refuse to shake hands with any other women. The other $10$ women all shake hands with each other (but not with themselves). How many handshakes are there at the party? My Solution: Handshakes done by men : There are $20$ ways to pick a man and $38$ ways to pick the other person, totaling to $20 \cdot 38 = 760$. But since every handshake is counted twice, the answer is $\frac{760}{2} = 380$ Handshakes done by the women who refuse to shake hand with any other women : these are already counted in $380$ handshakes (Because the women can only shake hands with men. This was taken care of above). Handshakes done by the other $10$ women and men : These are counted in $380$ handshakes.
