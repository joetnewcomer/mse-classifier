3,Discrete group of isometries of a finitely compact metric space is countable.,Discrete group of isometries of a finitely compact metric space is countable.,,"This question comes from Ratcliffe's Foundations of Hyperbolic Manifolds . Let $X$ be a finitely compact metric space (i.e. all closed metric balls are compact). Prove that a discrete group $\Gamma$ of isometries of a $X$ is countable. $X$ being finitely compact tells us that $\Gamma$ also acts discontinuously on $X$ (this is a theorem in the text). Apparently it also tells us that $X$ is second-countable (the author just says this; I've not seen it proven, but I'm willing to accept is as fact for now). My thought is to somehow appeal to this discontinuous action on the closed, compact metric balls $\bar{B_i}$, where $\{B_i\}$ is the countable base for the topology. However, I've not successfully figured out a way to mix these two ideas. Does anyone have any suggestions for other approaches?

44,Orbits of properly discontinuous actions,Orbits of properly discontinuous actions,,"Definition Let $G$ be a group and $X$ a topological space. Let $G\curvearrowright X$ by homeomorphisms. We call the action properly discontinuous if for all $x\in X$ there exists an open neighborhood $U\ni x$ such that for all $g\in G\smallsetminus\{1_G\}$ we have $gU\cap U=\varnothing$, $gU$ being the image of $U$ by the action of $G$, i.e. $gU=\{g\cdot x:x\in U\}$, having denoted the action by $\cdot$. Remark If $G\curvearrowright X$ is a properly discontinuous action, then its orbits are discrete and closed. That is what I have on  my Geometry 3 notes. I tried to prove the remark, whose proof was left as an exercise, and got stuck on the closed part. Let me show you what I have managed. Claim 1 The orbits are discrete, i.e. the subspace topology on the orbits is the discrete one. Which means all subsets of the orbits are open in the subspace topology the orbit inherits from $X$. Proof Let $x\in X$. There exists, by definition, a neighborhood $U\ni x$ such that if $g\neq1_G$, $gU\cap U=\varnothing$. This means $U\cap(G\cdot x)=\{x\}$, so $\{x\}$ is open in the orbit. The same line of thought can be conducted for any element of the orbit. Therefore, the orbit is discrete. $\hspace{1cm}\square$ Claim 2 If $X$ is not Hausdorff, I cannot prove the orbits are closed, since in general they are not. Proof If $X$ is not Hausdorff, there exists at least a couple of topologically indistinguishable points, i.e. there exist $x,y\in X$ such that if $U\ni x$ is a neighborhood of $x$, then $y\in U$, and viceversa. There can be no $g\in G$ such that $gx=y$, because we have the neighborhood in the definition which separates $x$ from the rest of the orbit, and if $y$ were in the same orbit as $x$ we would have a contradiction. Let me say this better. Suppose $y=gx$ for some $g\in G$. We know $g\neq1_G$ as $x\neq y$. But then there exists $U\ni x$ a neighborhood such that $gU\cap U=\varnothing$ for all $g\in G\smallsetminus\{1_G\}$, in particular for the element sending $x$ to $y$, let it be $\overline{g}$. But $y\in\overline{g}U$, and $x\in U$, so that would separate $x,y$, against the hypothesis of topological indistinguishability, since $x\mapsto\overline{g}x$ is a homeomorphism and thus $\overline{g}U$ is still open. But if there exist such two points, then $y$ is an accumulation point of $G\cdot x$ and viceversa, so $G\cdot x$ and $G\cdot y$ are not closed. $\hspace{2cm}\square$ Claim 3 If $x\in X$, and $y$ is an accumulation point of $G\cdot x$, that is for all neighborhoods $U\ni y$ there exists $g:gx\in U\smallsetminus\{y\}$, then $y\not\in G\cdot x$. Proof Suppose $y=\overline{g}x$ for $\overline{g}\in G$. By definition of p.d. actions, we can find a neighborhood $U\ni y$ such that $gU\cap U=\varnothing$ for all $g\in G\smallsetminus\{1_G\}$. This $U$ will contain at least a point $\tilde x$ of $G\cdot x$ different from $y$. $G$ is transitive over $G\cdot x$, so we can find $\tilde g:\tilde gy=\tilde x$. But then $\tilde gU\cap U\ni\tilde x$, against the definition of p.d. action. $\hspace{6cm}\square$ Claim 4 If $|G|<\infty$, then the orbits are closed. Proof If $|G|<\infty$, then $|G\cdot x|\leq|G|<\infty$. Since by now we have the hypothesis that $X$ is Hausdorff, as we have show above that the orbits are, in general, not closed in a non-Hausdorff space, we conclude that for all $g\in G,y\not\in G\cdot x$ there exist neighborhoods $U_g\ni gx,V_g\ni y$ such that $U_g\cap V_g=\varnothing$. Let $V=\bigcap_{g\in G}V_g$. This is a finite intersection of neighborhoods, so is still a neighborhood of $y$, and it is disjoint from the orbit since we have excluded every $gx$ from it. Btw, $gx$ is $g\cdot x$, so I'm implying the $\cdot$. So $y$ is in the interior of the orbit's complement, which is therefore open. $\hspace{11cm}\square$ And here is where I got stuck: with infinite groups. Problem If $G$ is infinite, how do I show that there cannot be a point $y\in X$ such that if $U\ni y$ is open, $U\cap(G\cdot x)\neq\varnothing,\{y\}$? For the moment, I have shown that if there exists such a $y$, besides being outside the orbit by claim 3, there are infinitely many such points. More precisely, I have the following two further claims. Claim 5 If $y$ is a point as described above, then $gy$ is another such point, for all $g\in G$. Proof If $U$ is a neighborhood of $gy$, then $g^{-1}U$ is a neighborhood of $y$. $y$ is as above, so $g^{-1}U$ contains a point of the orbit $\overline{g}x$. But then $g\overline{g}\in gg^{-1}U=U$, proving $U$ contains a point of the orbit. Thus, $gy$ is as above, just like $y$. $\hspace{8cm}\square$ Claim 6 If an action is properly discontinuous, then its orbits are in bijection with the group $G$. Proof Suppose it is not so. This means there exist $g_1,g_2\in G,x\in X$ such that $g_1x=g_2x$. But then we have $g_2^{-1}g_1x=x$. So without loss of generality, we can assume there exists $g\in G:gx=x$. But this cannot be, since there is a neighborhood of $x$ mapped by $g$ into a disjoint neighborhood of $gx$. $\hspace{8cm}\square$ That is all. I did not manage to show there cannot be a $y$ as above. I tried reaching a contradiction by supposing there was, but ended up with an orbit of such $y$s and an infinite number of subsets of $G\cdot x$ accumulating each around a different point of $G\cdot y$. I am tempted to say well, but then there are more points in $G\cdot x$ than in $G\cdot y$, but that cannot be since they are both in bijection with $G$. But then, $G$ is infinite, and this arguments works terribly with infinity. For example, a countable union of countable subsets would be more than countable with that argument, but in fact it is countable.

49,Subtlety in the Definition of Limit Point,Subtlety in the Definition of Limit Point,,"In my time studying mathematics I have always found some subtle confusion with the definition of a limit point.  I know it's possible for different definitions to yield the same results, and the issues with this might be syntactical rather than anything else, but this subtlety is really bothering me. Given a topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ and a subset $A \subseteq X$, I've seen definitions that a limit point is any element $p \in X$ such that every neighborhood of $p$ intersects $A$ at some point other than $p$.  But I've also seen the definition that $p$ is a limit point provided that if $U$ is a neighborhood of $p$ then $U \cap A \neq \emptyset$, where the latter can admit the possibility that $A \cap U = \{p\}$. To illustrate a case where these competing definitions might get confusing, consider $\mathbb{R}$ with the particular point topology centered at $0$ (that is, any $A \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R})$ containing $0$ is open).  The interval $(1,2)$ is closed in this topology since its complement $(-\infty,1)\cup (2,\infty)$ is open.  Notice however that for any $x \in \mathbb{R}$ the set $\{0,x\}$ is open in this topology.  We expect that since $(1,2)$ is closed that it should contain all of its limit points.  If we go with the second definition of limit point over the first, we find that if $x$ is a limit point of $(1,2)$ then we should have $\{0,x\} \cap (1,2) \neq \emptyset$, but this only occurs when $x \in (1,2)$.  This shows however that $x$ has a neighborhood intersecting $(1,2)$ that doesn't contain any other point of $(1,2)$, so $x$ can't possibly be a limit point of this interval if we adhere to the first definition.  Furthermore $(1,2)$ has no limit points according to the first definition. I do want to acknowledge that the first definition is there to make sure that isolated points aren't mistaken for limit points.  For example, in the Euclidean topology on $\mathbb{R}$ we would never look at the set $\{0\}\cup(1,2)$ and say $0$ is a limit point of this set.  Is there something I'm missing here?  Is there truly some ambiguity with these definitions or am I just not seeing it?

The interval $(1,2)$ is closed in this topology since its complement $(-\infty,1)\cup (2,\infty)$ is open.  Notice however that for any $x \in \mathbb{R}$ the set $\{0,x\}$ is open in this topology.  We expect that since $(1,2)$ is closed that it should contain all of its limit points.  If we go with the second definition of limit point over the first, we find that if $x$ is a limit point of $(1,2)$ then we should have $\{0,x\} \cap (1,2) \neq \emptyset$, but this only occurs when $x \in (1,2)$.  This shows however that $x$ has a neighborhood intersecting $(1,2)$ that doesn't contain any other point of $(1,2)$, so $x$ can't possibly be a limit point of this interval if we adhere to the first definition.  Furthermore $(1,2)$ has no limit points according to the first definition. I do want to acknowledge that the first definition is there to make sure that isolated points aren't mistaken for limit points.  For example, in the Euclidean topology on $\mathbb{R}$ we would never look at the set $\{0\}\cup(1,2)$ and say $0$ is a limit point of this set.  Is there something I'm missing here?  Is there truly some ambiguity with these definitions or am I just not seeing it?  Looking forward to the discussion.",,"['general-topology', 'definition']"

I have a proof, but I am not convinced that it is correct. Some helpful hints, better solution(s), or correct solution, or any feedback if I am correct (or not) will be greatly appreciated. Thanks. Here is my solution: We can assume, for simplicity of the proof, that $X=X_{1} \times X_{2}$. Let $E$ and $F$ be two disjoint closed subsets of $X_{j}$ for fixed $j=1$. Fix an element $y$ in $X_{2}$. Then the slices $E \times \{y\}$ and $F \times \{y\}$ are thus disjoint closed subsets of $X$. So since $X$ is normal, there are two disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ containing $E \times \{y\}$ and $F\times \{y\}$, respectively in $X$. Now, the projection maps $\pi_{j}(U)$ and $\pi_{j}(V)$ are disjoint open sets containing $E$ and $F$, as required. Thus, $X_{j}$, for $j=1$ is normal.

Question Let $A=\{(x,y) \in \mathbb R^2 | x^2 \leq y\}$ Find the interior of $A$, the closure of $A$, and the boundary of $A$. Is $A$ an open set? Is it a closed set? My answers $A$ is not an open set. For example, $(1,1) \in A$ but if we look at a circle with $(1,1)$ in the center, and with radius $\epsilon$ as small as we wish, not all the elements in that circle will belong to $A$. For example, $(1+\epsilon,1) \notin A$. So $A$ is not an open set.
