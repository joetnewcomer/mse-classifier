Please help!,According to me $\operatorname{arccot}(-1)$ should be equal to $3\pi/4$ because  $\operatorname{arccot}(-x) = \pi - \operatorname{arccot}(x)$. But in my book it is given to be $-\pi$/4... also on wolfram alpha $\operatorname{arccot}(-1)$ is given as $-\pi/4$... Please help!,,"['calculus', 'algebra-precalculus', 'trigonometry']"
