5,Schemes to the rescue?,Schemes to the rescue?,,"I am reading chapter 1 of Gille and Szamuely's book Central Simple Algebras and Galois Cohomology , on quaternion algebras. In it they prove (remark 1.3.1 on p. 18) that the conic associated to a quaternion algebra is an intrinsic invariant of the algebra, i.e. does not depend (at least up to isomorphism of the conic) on the basis chosen for the algebra. The argument almost convinces me, but not quite (see below). I am wondering if the ingredient that I need to convince me is to cast the argument in scheme-theoretic language. Thus, my first question is, can you help me formulate the argument in a way that speaks to my discomfort with it? My second question is, can we use schemes to do this? Background: Let $k$ be a field of characteristic $\neq 2$. The quaternion algebra $$A = \binom{a,b}{k}$$ for $a,b\in k^\times$ is the four-dimensional associative $k$-algebra with basis $1,i,j,ij$ and (noncommutative) multiplication defined by $i^2=a, j^2=b, ij = -ji$; $1$ is identified with the unit of $k$. (Thus the usual Hamilton quaternions are the case $a=b=-1, k=\mathbb{R}$.) A change of basis is elements $1,i',j',i'j'$ in $A$ satisfying $i'^2=a', j'^2=b', i'j'=-j'i'$ for some (possibly different) $a',b'\in k^\times$. The subspace spanned by $i,j,ij$ does not depend on the basis since a calculation shows that this is exactly the set of elements of $A\setminus k$ whose square is $\in k$. This is called the subspace of pure quaternions . The conic associated to $A$ is the conic in $\mathbb{P}^2_k$ defined by the form $ax^2+by^2-z^2$. Up to a simple substitution, this is the same as the conic defined by $ax^2+by^2-abz^2$. $A$ is said to be split if it is isomorphic to $M_2(k)$. For example, if $a=1$, $A$ is split, because it can be mapped isomorphically onto $M_2(k)$ by $$i\mapsto \begin{pmatrix}1& \\ &-1\end{pmatrix},\; j\mapsto \begin{pmatrix} &b\\ 1& \end{pmatrix}$$ A basic theorem says that $A$ is split if and only if the associated conic has a $k$-rational point. The argument: Gille and Szamuely argue that changing basis in a quaternion algebra, which may change $a,b$, nonetheless does not change the isomorphism class of the associated conic. Their argument is essentially that the form $ax^2 + by^2 - abz^2$ which defines the conic is just given by squaring the pure quaternion $xi + yj + zij$. Since the space of pure quaternions is basis independent, so is this form, and thus so is the conic. My discomfort with it: I like this argument, and I buy it in essence, but a detail troubles me. Namely, when I try to actually write down a basis-independent description of the conic, I come up empty (literally): Okay, so the conic ""is"" the vanishing set in $\mathbb{P}_k^2$ of the form $ax^2+by^2 - abz^2$. Great, I can conceive of $\mathbb{P}_k^2$ as being the quotient of the space of pure quaternions by the scalar $k^\times$ action. Then the conic is the vanishing set of the form $\alpha^2$, where $\alpha$ is a pure quaternion. The problem is this. In all interesting cases, i.e. whenever $A$ is not split, the conic I've just described is, as a set, empty . (Because the conic does not have $k$-rational points when $A$ is not split.) This empty set has lost the ability to distinguish between nonsplit nonisomorphic quaternion algebras, so it is not doing the job I came to it for. This objection does not feel very substantive. The conic is not really the set of its $k$-rational points. (This seems like just the type of distinction that scheme theory is good at, hence the title of the question.)

32,Understanding the Euler sequence on $\mathbb{P}^n$,Understanding the Euler sequence on,\mathbb{P}^n,"I want to get an intuition for the Euler sequence by understanding the explicit construction of maps between terms. I prefer to use this version: $$ 0  \longrightarrow \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n} \longrightarrow \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n}(1)^{\oplus(n+1)} \longrightarrow T\mathbb{P}^n  \longrightarrow 0 $$ rather than its dual or any twisted version. Conventions : $[x_0 : x_1 : \dots :x_n]$ are projective coordinates on $\mathbb{P}^n$ . I will slightly abuse notation and describe sections of degree $d$ line bundles with the same notation, e.g. $x_0^d + 2x_1^{d-1}x_2$ is a section of $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n}(d)$ . First map If $c$ is a locally constant function on $\mathbb{P}^n$ , then $$ f: \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n} \longrightarrow \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n}(1)^{\oplus(n+1)}, \quad c \mapsto (c\cdot x_0, c \cdot x_1, \dots,c\cdot x_n) $$ i.e. multiplication of the linear monomials by $c$ (which is usually taken to be 1). Second map For a set of linear (homogeneous degree 1) functions $l_i(x)$ , $i=0,\dots,n$ on $\mathbb{P}^n$ , we have $$ g: \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n}(1)^{\oplus(n+1)} \longrightarrow T\mathbb{P}^n , \\ (l_0(x), l_1(x), \dots, l_n(x)) \longmapsto l_0(x) \frac{\partial\,}{\partial x_0} +  l_1(x) \frac{\partial\,}{\partial x_1} + \dots + l_n(x) \frac{\partial\,}{\partial x_n} $$ Showing $\mathrm{im}(f) = \mathrm{ker}(g)$ If we apply $(g\circ f)$ onto our locally constant $c$ , we arrive at the vector $$ c \cdot x_0 \frac{\partial\,}{\partial x_0} +  c \cdot x_1 \frac{\partial\,}{\partial x_1} + \dots +  c \cdot x_n \frac{\partial\,}{\partial x_n}, $$ which is known as the ""Euler vector field"" or EVF (or at least, it is $c$ times the usual definition of the EVF). It should be straightforward to see that the EVF acting on a homogeneous polynomial $q(x)$ of degree $d$ will return $d \cdot q(x)$ . In particular, if $q$ is homogeneous of degree $0$ , i.e. constant, then the EVF( $q$ ) returns 0. This is where my understanding gets a little shaky: The above makes sense, but the statement I see in the literature jumps from saying ""the EVF annihilates degree 0 functions"" to saying that ""the EVF is the kernel of $g$ "" and concluding the description. This is a little hard for me to parse because I feel $\mathrm{ker}(g)$ lies in $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n}(1)^{\oplus(n+1)}$ , but the EVF seems to lie in $T\mathbb{P}^n$ . Another point -- which may be central to the whole issue -- is if $\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}$ are a proper set of basis vectors for $\mathbb{P}^n$ .

Its proof for case (1) proceeds as follows: Pick a $S$ -scheme $U$ and $y \in Y(U)$ : to show $X \times_Y U$ is representable, it suffices to consider the following cartesian diagram (reader will explicate the arrows): $\require{AMScd}$ \begin{CD} X \times_Y U @>{}>> X \times_Z U\\ @VVV @VVV\\ Y \times_Z Y @>{}>> Y \times_S Y \end{CD} The proof then deduces case (2) (resp.

55,Jacobians of reducible curves,Jacobians of reducible curves,,"Let $C$ be a connected, reduced but reducible projective curve over an algebraically closed field. Denote by $\pi:\tilde{C}\to C$ its normalisation. There are two standard references for computing $J(C)=\rm{Pic}^0(C)$ , namely Harris-Morrison's 'Moduli of Curves' section 5.B and Bosch-Lütkebohmert-Raynaud's 'Néron Models' section 9.2. I am happy with the computations of the Jacobian for the node, the cusp and for compact type curves, but am experiencing some confusion applying the occasionally unclear text of the above references to more complicated cases. Take for example the case of three distinct smooth rational curves meeting at one point - i.e. a star-shaped cubic in $\mathbb{P}^2$ . The arithmetic genus is one (as it's a plane cubic) whereas the normalisation consists of three disjoint $\mathbb{P}^1$ 's. For any $C$ as in the first paragraph we have an induced exact sequence $$0\to\mathcal{O}^*_C\to\pi_*\mathcal{O}^*_{\tilde{C}}\to F\to0$$ where $F$ is a torsion sheaf supported on the singular locus of $C$ . Harris-Morrison in exercise 5.11(2) give a formula for computing how many $\mathbb{G}_m$ and $\mathbb{G}_a$ factors the sheaf $F$ comprises of. In their notation, if $C$ is the star-shaped cubic with singularity $p$ , one finds $b=2$ as the number of branches is 3, whereas $\dim(\pi_*\mathcal{O}^*_{\tilde{C}}/\mathcal{O}^*_C)_p$ should be ''the contribution at $p$ to the difference in arithmetic genus between $C$ and $\tilde{C}$ ''. This would imply $a+b=1$ meaning $a=-1$ which is already confusing and my first point in need of clarification. Moving on under the assumption $a=0$ though, the cohomology of the above sequence gives $$0\to\mathbb{G}_m\to\mathbb{G}_m^3\to\rm{H}^0(F)\to J(C)\to J(\tilde{C})\to 0.$$ $J(\tilde{C})=0$ as it consists of disjoint rational curves whereas the above computation gives $\rm{H}^0(F)=\mathbb{G}_m^2$ . This leads to $J(C)=0$ by a dimension count from the sequence. This is at odds with my expectation that the Jacobian of $C$ should be one dimensional. Some further comments: A further way to see that $\rm{H}^0(F)=\mathbb{G}_m^2$ in the above example is the following. The stalk at $p$ of the first short exact sequence above is as follows: the middle group is generated by three functions $f_1,f_2,f_3$ , each defined on a neighbourhood of a preimage of $p$ on each of the $\mathbb{P}^1$ 's of the normalisation, and it contains $\mathcal{O}^*_{C,p}$ those functions so that $f_1(p)=f_2(p)=f_3(p)$ . The quotient $F_p$ should then be given by $(\frac{f_1(p)}{f_2(p)}, \frac{f_2(p)}{f_3(p)})$ ie $\mathbb{G}_m^2$ - although there may be a mistake here. Unraveling Propositions 9 and 10 (and the definition of the intermediate curve $X'$ ) in the 'Néron Models' section, one expects copies of $\mathbb{G}_a$ to appear in $F$ whenever the singularity admits a resolution which is a homeomorphism (eg a cusp) in the sense that there's only one preimage.

Denote by its normalisation. There are two standard references for computing , namely Harris-Morrison's 'Moduli of Curves' section 5.B and Bosch-Lütkebohmert-Raynaud's 'Néron Models' section 9.2. I am happy with the computations of the Jacobian for the node, the cusp and for compact type curves, but am experiencing some confusion applying the occasionally unclear text of the above references to more complicated cases. Take for example the case of three distinct smooth rational curves meeting at one point - i.e. a star-shaped cubic in . The arithmetic genus is one (as it's a plane cubic) whereas the normalisation consists of three disjoint 's. For any as in the first paragraph we have an induced exact sequence where is a torsion sheaf supported on the singular locus of . Harris-Morrison in exercise 5.11(2) give a formula for computing how many and factors the sheaf comprises of. In their notation, if is the star-shaped cubic with singularity , one finds as the number of branches is 3, whereas should be ''the contribution at to the difference in arithmetic genus between and ''. This would imply meaning which is already confusing and my first point in need of clarification.

I think most of them are due to not being comfortable enough with the algebraic geometry notions involved. I managed to read on ignoring them but they are still bugging me. I apologize if the questions seems somewhat contentless . Here is a link to the book. Below are my questions. $C/S$ is a smooth curve over $S$ and $D$ is an effective Cartier divisor. (1) Does $\mathcal O_D$ mean the structure sheaf of $D$ as a scheme, or is it $\mathcal O_C/I(D)$ as a sheaf on $\mathcal O_C$ ? I know they are roughly the same, but I am not comfortable enough in my algebraic geometry yet to treat them as the same (if I am wrong, please point out). In the latter case, (1') would the structure sheaf of $D$ be $i^*(\mathcal O_D)$ , where $i$ is the inclusion $D\hookrightarrow X$ , is that correct? (1'') Otherwise, if $\mathcal O_D$ meant the structure sheaf on $D$ , would $\mathscr L\otimes_{\mathcal O_C}\mathcal O_D$ mean then $\mathscr L\otimes_{\mathcal O_C}i_*(\mathcal O_D)$ ? (2) On page 9, we have $\mathscr L/\mathcal O\cong I^{-1}(D)/\mathcal O\cong I^{-1}(D)\otimes_{\mathcal O_C}\mathcal O_D\cong\mathscr L\otimes_{\mathcal O_C}\mathcal O_D=$ an invertible $\mathcal O_D$ -Module. Therefore $D$ is proper over $S$ if and only if the sheaf $\mathscr L/\mathcal O$ has its support proper over $S$ . Why is this so? (3) Here $X$ is any scheme over $S$ and $D,D'$ effective Cartier divisors. On page 13, Globally, in terms of representatives $(\mathscr L,\ell)$ for $D$ and $(\mathscr L,\ell')$ for $D'$ , the condition $D'\le D$ is precisely that the global section $\ell$ of $\mathscr L$ vanish identically in $\mathscr L|D'=\mathscr L\otimes_{\mathcal O_X}\mathcal O_{D'}$ . Ok, so firstly here $\mathscr L|D'=\mathscr L\otimes_{\mathcal O_X}\mathcal O_{D'}$ really bugs me. From what I know, restriction of a sheaf to a subscheme is via pullback of the inclusion map and it gives a sheaf on the subscheme . So then the LHS would be a sheaf on $D'$ while the right hand side is a sheaf on $X$ . There is an exact sequence below involving such terms and it is definitely meant as an exact sequence of sheaves on $X$ , so... what exactly does $\mathscr L|D'$ denote here? Secondly (3') What does it mean that $\ell$ vanishes in $\mathscr L\otimes_{\mathcal O_X}\mathcal O_{D'}$ and why is this implies by $D'\le D$ ? I would be grateful if someone could spell this out in some detail. I don't have any issue understanding the discussion of $D'\le D$ above in terms of their ideal sheaves but somehow I can't translate this into $(\mathscr L,\ell)$ language.

Let $s$ be the degree of $p$, then $q(z_0, \dots, z_n) = z_0^s p(z_2/z_0, \dots, z_n/z_0)$ is a homogeneous polynomial of degree $s$ that vanishes on $X$. Being $F$ non singular and homogeneous it is irreducible, so $F \mid q$ but this is impossible because $F$ depends on $z_j$ and $q$ does not. Does this proof work? If not, can someone give me a hint?

I'm most interested in any references to what people have tried in the past, as nLab states that people have tried to look at such a topos in the past, but gives no references for me to chase down and learn from. Here is where I have gotten so far: While we may want to look at algebras over a noncommutative ring $R$ with unit as objects in the coslice category $R/\mathbf{Ring}$ (as the category of unital algebras over a commutative ring $A$ may be identified with the coslice categories $A/\mathbf{Ring}$ or $A/\mathbf{Cring}$ depending on one's taste for commutativity), and while we certainly have a natural analogue of finite generation of an algebra $R \xrightarrow{f} S$ over $R$, what I wish to know is primarily if there has been any work in looking at lifting properties and extensions. In particular, for commutative algebras $A \xrightarrow{f} B$ over a commutative ring with unit $A$, $B$ is étale over $A$ if and only if $B$ is finitely generated over $A$ and for any algebra $A \xrightarrow{g} C$ with $N \trianglelefteq C$ nilpotent, there exists a unique $h:B \to C/N$ making the diagram $$ \begin{array} s & A & \xrightarrow{f} & B \\  & g\downarrow & & \downarrow\exists!h \\  & C & \xrightarrow{\pi_N} & C/N \end{array} $$ commute.

What I'm worried about primarily is in the noncommutative case what kind of (let's say two-sided) ideal we would want $N \trianglelefteq C$ to be; while nilpotent ideals could remain useful to look at, I have been led to believe that it may be more appropriate to look at ideals $N$ contained inside the Jacobson radical $J(C)$. The reason I suspect this is more appropriate is because when $S \subseteq R$ is a (two-sided) Ore set (so that $S^{-1}R$ has all its elements take the form $\lambda_S(r)\lambda_S(s)$ for $r \in R, s \in S$, and universal $S$-inverting morphism $\lambda_S$, or at least be uniquely isomorphic to a representation of this form, and two-sided so we don't have to worry about any stupid things happening with sidedness) we should be able to lift any element of $C/N$ in the diagram $$ \begin{array} s & R & \xrightarrow{\lambda_S} & S^{-1}R \\  & f\downarrow & & \\  & C & \xrightarrow{\pi_N} & C/N \end{array} $$ and induce a morphism $h:S^{-1}R \to C/N$ rendering the whole thing commutative.

Roughly, we can divide them in two sets, see Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabi%E2%80%93Yau_manifold . I will refer to this link for notations and everything else. Wikipedia says that when $M$ is simply-connected, these two definitions are equivalent. But if $M$ is only connected, then we have that the first one implies the second one but not the vice versa. I agree with both the statements. My problem is the following. Suppose that $M$ is not simply-connected and the holonomy group $Hol(M)$ is contained in $SU(n)$ (here $n$ is the complex dimension of $M$). By the holomy principle there exists a parallel $n$-form, i.e. a parallel section of the canonical bundle $K_M=\Omega_M^n$. In particular this implies that $K_M$ is flat and since the curvature of $K_M$ is proportional to the Ricci tensor of $M$, we get that $M$ is Ricci-flat.

We cannot go the other direction. This is for example the case of an Enrique surface. 3) in the non simply-connected case, I can run my argument on the universal cover of $M$, which is simply-connected and hence everything works well.

This looks like a rather strong assumption to check, especially if one is interested in computing cohomology just in low degrees (in particular I am interested in degree 0 and 1).

I may be very wrong on this point, so the question is Can someone provide a counter example in which we really need that cohomology vanishes in all the degrees and not just up to what we are interested in? or Can someone point out a reference which clearly states that we can just check up to degree $p$ (or $p+1$, depending on your indexing) to prove the isomorphism?

The theorem states that if we have a space $X$, a sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ and a covering of $X$ such that our sheaf is acyclic on the covering, i.e. Čech cohomology  is $0$ on every finite intersection of elements in the covering, then these two cohomologies agree. Now, my question. All the proves that I've found are by induction and assume that cohomology vanishes in every degree, so $\check{\mathrm{H}}^p(\mathcal{U}, \mathcal{F})=0$ for every $p>0$. This looks like a rather strong assumption to check, especially if one is interested in computing cohomology just in low degrees (in particular I am interested in degree 0 and 1). Looking at the proves that I found, indeed, it seems to me that we just need that Čech cohomology vanishes up to degree $p$ to prove the isomorphism in this degree (for example Climbing Mount Bourbaki ).
