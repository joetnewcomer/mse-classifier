1,Reduce formula using Euler's?,Reduce formula using Euler's?,,"I am performing a self-study, and I am lost as to a derivation that has taken place.

[duplicate],"\mathbb{C}[\cos{x},\sin{x}] \mathbb{C}[X,Y]","This question already has answers here : Ring of trigonometric functions with real coefficients (3 answers) Closed 2 years ago . Here, $\sin{x}$ and $\cos{x}$ are real functions $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ . First, let me explain what I mean by ""as a quotient ring"". It can be easily shown that $$ \mathbb{R}[\cos{x},\sin{x}] \cong \mathbb{R}[X,Y]/(X^2+Y^2-1). $$ Here $\mathbb{R}[\cos{x},\sin{x}]$ is a quotient ring of $\mathbb{R}[X,Y]$ . So when the field is changed to $\mathbb{C}$ , I immediately think about the ring $$ \mathbb{C}[X,Y]/(X^2+Y^2-1). $$ As people have pointed out, my argument quoted below is questionable, so I redo it in update 2. This paragraph is left here only for the record. I elaborated it in update 3. However, $\mathbb{C}[\cos{x},\sin{x}]$ is not a UFD ( $\sin^2{x}=(1+\cos{x})(1-\cos{x})$ ), but $\mathbb{C}[X,Y]/(X^2+Y^2-1) \cong \mathbb{C}[T,T^{-1}]$ is a UFD. Therefore $\mathbb{C}[\cos{x},\sin{x}]$ can only be a proper subring quotient ring of $\mathbb{C}[X,Y]/(X^2+Y^2-1)$ . An extra restriction is missing here. Is there anyway to find it? I think there is something derived from the fact that $\mathbb{C}$ is algebraically closed. Update 1: It is not very obvious that $\mathbb{C}[X,Y]/(X^2+Y^2-1)$ is a PID and therefore UFD, but one can find proofs in this question post: Ring of trigonometric functions with real coefficients Update 2: It seems my argument on being UFD is a little messed up, so I will redo it. First of all, $R=\mathbb{R}[X,Y]/(X^2+Y^2-1)$ is not a UFD (one can show that its ideal class group is $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ ) and $S=\mathbb{C}[X,Y]/(X^2+Y^2-1) \cong \mathbb{C}[T,T^{-1}]$ is a UFD (see the link in update 1). Extending the scalar here is not a trivial matter, so the relation between $\mathbb{C}[\cos{x},\sin{x}]$ and $\mathbb{C}[X,Y]/(X^2+Y^2-1)$ is not likely to be as immediate as the case of real scalar. Update 3: In the ring $\mathbb{R}[\cos{x},\sin{x}]$ , irreducible elements are of the form $a\sin{x}+b\cos{x}+c$ where $a^2+b^2 \ne 0$ ; meanwhile, in the ring $\mathbb{C}[\cos{x},\sin{x}]$ , irreducible elements are of the form $\cos{x}+i\sin{x}+a$ where $a \in \mathbb{C}^\ast$ . I found them on this book (section: The Trigonometric Polynomial Rings). Hence $\sin{x}$ , $1-\cos{x}$ and $1+\cos{x}$ are irreducible in $\mathbb{R}[\cos{x},\sin{x}]$ but not irreducible in $\mathbb{C}[\cos{x},\sin{x}]$ . This is the source of my mistake. According to the comments this question have received, this change is not easily spotted.

Question: Can 'q' be calculated without using the Sine or Cosine Rule, using only lengths 'a' through f? UPDATE : I found another solution (no Sine law, only squares & roots)  after posting part 2 (links in comments). Also added some numbers to make it easier to verify the answers. Here we replaced $a = \sqrt{33}, b = 4, c = 7, f = 5, e = \sqrt{32}$ and $B(x,y)$ will touch $Origin(0,0)$ when rotated. Using Heron's area formula, we can deduce $o = A(0,4)$. Similarly, we can deduce $B(1,71,-3.28)$. From there, a pythagoras formula to obtain $q = 7.479$",,['trigonometry']

Here is my attempt at doing so: Which now we need to simplify . Here's how we do so: Using Euler's Identity Since we know that since and are both periodic with period (if I remember correctly), Which we can prove that that is the answer like this: My question Is the solution that I have achieved correct, or what could I do to achieve the correct solution or attain it more easily? Mistakes I might have made Remembering Euler's Identity Remembering the period of both and My assumption for solving any Complex logarithms :\ To clarify The final result should probably be written as meaning that for any","i^x 2 i^x=2 \implies x\ln(i)=\ln(2) \implies x=\dfrac{\ln(2)}{\ln(i)} \ln(i) e^{i\theta}=\cos(\theta)+i\sin(\theta) -1=\cos(\pi+2\pi k)+i\sin(\pi+2\pi k)=e^{i\pi+2i\pi k} \cos(x) \sin(x) 2\pi \implies i=\sqrt{-1}=\sqrt{e^{i\pi+2i\pi k}}=e^{\frac{i\pi}2+i\pi k} \implies x=\dfrac{\ln(2)}{\ln(i)} =\dfrac{\ln(2)}{\left(\dfrac{i\pi}2+i\pi k\right)} \implies\dfrac{\ln(2)}{\left(\dfrac{i\pi+2i\pi k}2\right)} =\dfrac{2\ln(2)}{i\pi+2i\pi k},k\in\mathbb{Z} i^x=2 i^\frac{2\ln(2)}{i\pi+2i\pi k}=2 \implies\dfrac{2\ln(2)\ln(i)}{i\pi+2i\pi k}=\ln(2) \implies\dfrac{2\ln(i)}{i\pi+2i\pi k}=1 2\ln(i)=i\pi+2i\pi k i^2=-1=e^{i\pi+2i\pi k} \therefore i^\frac{2\ln(2)}{i\pi+2i\pi k}\overset\checkmark=2 \therefore\text{ for any }i^x=z z=\dfrac{2\ln(z)}{i\pi+2i\pi k},k\in\mathbb{Z} \sin(x) \cos(x) i^x=z x=\dfrac{-2i\ln(2)}{\pi+2\pi k} i^x=z x=\dfrac{-2i\ln(z)}{\pi+2\pi k}","['trigonometry', 'solution-verification', 'complex-numbers', 'logarithms']"

58,"Proving $\,\sin^272^\circ - \sin^260^\circ = \frac18\left(\sqrt5 - 1\right)$",Proving,"\,\sin^272^\circ - \sin^260^\circ = \frac18\left(\sqrt5 - 1\right)","I'm fairly new into proving trigonometric equations, but I believe I'm getting better at it day after day. Yet, I have stumbled upon one such which left me at an impasse. The problem is presented as follows: $$\sin^272^\circ - \sin^260^\circ = \dfrac{\sqrt5 - 1}8$$ The goal is to prove the truth of the so-presented equation. I first complicated the right-hand side of the equation to $\dfrac{\sqrt5-1}4\cdot\dfrac12$ to then simplify it into $\sin18^\circ\cdot\sin30^\circ$ (knowing, of course, that $\dfrac{\sqrt5-1}4$ is equal to $\sin18^\circ$ , and that $\dfrac12$ is equal to $\sin30^\circ$ ). I then proceeded to work the proof from the left-hand side, now that both sides of the equation are termed in trigonometric ratios. The left-hand side is easily noticed to be a difference of squares, hence being apt for complication as $(\sin72^\circ - \sin60^\circ)(\sin72^\circ + \sin60^\circ)$ . It is only a coincidence to notice that the expressions can be further simplified knowing the sum/difference to product rule (i.e. that $\sin A + \sin B = 2\sin\dfrac{A + B}2\cos\dfrac{A - B}2$ , and also that $\sin A - \sin B =2\cos\dfrac{A + B}2\sin\dfrac{A - B}2$ ). Executing these simplifications, we get the next result: $2\sin66^\circ\cdot\cos66^\circ\cdot2\sin6^\circ\cdot\cos6^\circ$ . It is evident to see how the double angle rules could be of use here (that $2\sin\theta\cos\theta =\sin2\theta$ ). The penultimate result with this rule applied is thus, so far: $\sin132^\circ\cdot\sin12^\circ$ . I can only go as far as to simply right the ratios in terms of angles less that $45$ degrees, which is: $\cos42^\circ\cdot\sin12^\circ$ . For the most of it, I am stuck; and any rules I apply to simplify either expression gets me to a result previously acquired in the run. How am I to finish proving that $\cos42^\circ\cdot\sin12^\circ$ is equal to $\sin18^\circ\cdot\sin30^\circ$ , or equivalently $\sin18^\circ\cdot\cos60^\circ$ . This problem can be found in S.L Loney's book on plane trigonometry, a really helpful book for getting a good picture on trigonometry.
