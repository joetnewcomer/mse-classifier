0,Complexity of matrix multiplication over $\mathbb F_2$,Complexity of matrix multiplication over,\mathbb F_2,"I've been reading about theoretical bounds on the computational complexity of $n\times n$ matrix-matrix multiplication in floating-point arithmetic, about how the complexity is known to fall between $\mathcal O(n^2)$ and $\mathcal O(n^3)$ , and how the exponent has been slowly whittled down over time by various researchers. It's currently unknown whether a $\mathcal O(n^2)$ algorithm is possible. I was wondering about what the complexity of multiplying two bit-matrices over the finite field $\mathbb F_2$ (or other finite fields - my intuition tells me the complexity will be the same), but I haven't found any references online.

3,Changing the basis in diagonalization: why doesn't it work?,Changing the basis in diagonalization: why doesn't it work?,,"I read the theorem  on Apostol Calculus II : Theorem $4.10$ Let $T : V \to V$ be a linear transformation, where $V$ has scalars in $F$ , and $\dim V = n$ .

It's like calculating the derivative of a function with limits, I rather figure out the tricks than always going through the limit. The 4th power of the input matrix looks like this and I suppose you can make certain deductions, such as and 0 and = 1. I would like to understand how to go from the input matrix straight to the solution , I can reach the solution if I take the 4th power of the input matrix and look for the number 3. But that will become very time consuming for big matrices, on the order of 100 x 100. Edit The part in the previous limit result had to receive another limit so here's the solution to that. Again, I found the solution by squaring many times and seeing error patterns and using wolframalpha to turn error sums to e functions. Maybe there is no simple way to find limits to matrices.","

For any specific weight of my network I could easily take the derivative, but for computational speed I want to write the derivatives out in terms of matrix expressions that could be simply coded and executed. Let us use the following notation: let $x\in\mathbb{R}^p$ be our set of $p$ inputs to our network. Let us have $m$ hidden layers of nodes each consisting of $n$ nodes. We will write the values at the $i^{th}$ hidden layer as $z_i$ , which are retieved from multipling the $i^{th}$ weight matrix $W_i$ by the previous layer a chosen function $f$ (sigmoid, RELU, etc). Finally, we consider only $1$ output node (since we could loop through the output nodes and do this for all of them, although it'd be nice to generalize). As such we can say that our network is given as $$ z_1 = f(W_1 x) $$ $$ z_2 = f(W_2 z_1) $$ $$ \vdots $$ $$ z_n = f(W_n z_{n-1}) $$ $$ \hat{y} = f(W_{n+1} z_n) $$ Using Mean Squared Error we get that our objective function for a given point is $$ MSE = (\hat{y} - y)^2 $$ The first update matrix (which is actually a vector) was fairly easy to find the update for.

25,Upper bound on condition number of row-normalized matrices,Upper bound on condition number of row-normalized matrices,,"I would like to study the condition number of a non-square normalized matrices as function of the original non row-normalized matrix. Let $X \in \mathbb{R}^{a \times b}$ (for $a > b$ ). We obtain $\hat X$ by taking all the rows of $X$ and normalizing them such that the $\ell_2$ norms of each row is $1$ . We can further assume that all the rows of $X$ are $1 \leq \|x_i| \leq \alpha$ Question I believe (and I would like to prove) that: $$\kappa(\hat X) \leq \kappa(X).$$ For me, the condition number of a matrix $X$ is defined as the ratio between the biggest and the smallest singular value of $X$ , i.e.: $$ \kappa(X) = \frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_k} $$ where $k$ is the rank of the matrix (which can be smaller than $b$ ) I think a property of matrix norm might come handy: its submultiplicativity: $$ \|AB\| \leq \|A\|\|B\|$$ from which it possible to derive the property that $$ \kappa(AB) \leq \kappa(A)\kappa(B)$$ (this is true only in some casis, see referenced questions at the bottom) We recall that the norm of a matrix can be defined from a ( $\ell_p$ which in our case is $\ell_2$ ) $$ \| A \| = \max_{x \neq 0, } \frac{\|Ax\|}{\|x\|}  = \max_{\|x\|=1} \|Ax\| = \sigma_1$$ My attempt: In general, it is easy to see that $\sigma_1(\hat X) < \sigma_1(X)$ , while I cannot prove that $\sigma_{min}(\hat X) > \sigma_{min}(S)$ for the smallest singular values. This is how I approached the proof: Let me recall you that the condition number, which usually for square matrices is defined as $\kappa(X) = \|X\| \|X^{-1}\|$ for the case of non-square matrices can be better defined as the ratio between the biggest and the smallest singular value. In other words: $\kappa(X)= \|X\|\|X^+\|$ (where $X^+$ is the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of $X$ , i.e. the matrix obtained by taking the inverse $1/\sigma_i$ of the singular values of $\sigma_i$ of $X$ ). We can think of $X$ as the product of $\hat X$ where I left multiply by $N_X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ , a diagonal matrix where the entry in position $ii$ is just $\|x_i\|$ , i.e. the norm of row $i$ . $$ X = N_X \hat X.$$ I thought that I can express the condition number as product of the norm. Unfortunately, this direction seems to lead me astray, as the inequality is in the wrong direction. So: $\kappa(X) = \|N_X\hat  X\| \|(N_X \hat X)^{+}\|=\|N_X\hat  X\| \|\hat  X^{+}N_X^{+} \| \leq \|N_X\| \|\hat  X\| \|\hat  X^{+}\|\|N_X^{+} \| $ and also $\kappa(\hat X) = \|\hat X\| \|\hat X^{-1}\|$ . Also note that $\kappa(N_X) = \kappa(N_X^{-1}) \leq \alpha$ , because of our assumption on the value of the norms of the rows of $X$ . This is equivalent of asking if these two conditions are satisfied: $\|\hat X\| \|\hat X^{+}\| \leq \|N_X\hat  X\| \|(N_X \hat X)^{+}\| $ $\| \hat X^+ \| \leq \|(N\hat X)^+ \| $ It is simple to observe that: $\|\hat X\| \leq \|N\hat X\|$ . This is because, by using the definition of norm of a matrix, $$\forall y \text{ s.t. } \|y\|=1 \text{ we have that } \|\hat Xy\| \leq  \|N \hat Xy\|$$ because each element on the diagonal is bigger than 1. We need to see if $\|\hat X^{+}\| \leq \|(N\hat X)^+\| = \|(\hat X^{+}N^{+})\|$ I am looking here for some monotonicty properties of matrix norms, or property that can be derived from the inverse of a matrix. Am I going in the right direction? Thanks. Reply to comment What if we start from $N^{-1}_XX = \hat X$ ? Then, I would obtain $\kappa(\hat X) = \kappa(N^{-1}_X X) \leq \kappa(N^{-1}_X)\kappa(X) \leq \alpha \kappa(X) $ This does not seems helpful, because we get to the point where $$\kappa(\hat X) \leq \alpha \kappa(X)$$ and, from the previous observation, $$ \kappa(X) \leq \alpha \kappa(\hat X) $$ Experiments I checked that this property is satisfied in two cases: if we have a diagonal matrix $X$ with some random scalar in it, then the normalized version is just the identity matrix, whose condition number is 1. for random matrices (random in sense of numpy.random.rand() ) it holds true that $\kappa(\hat X) \leq \kappa(X)$ Related questions There are numerous questions around the condition number of product of matrices: Condition number of a product of two matrices Counter example or proof that $\kappa(AB) \leq \kappa(A)\kappa(B) $ In the last question they show a counterexample for $\kappa(AB)\leq\kappa(A)\kappa(B) $ which apparently does not hold for non-square matrices.","I would like to study the condition number of a non-square normalized matrices as function of the original non row-normalized matrix.

Thank to the suggestion ( link3 ) by @Semiclassical, $$\det[(B+K)^{-1})(A+K)] =\frac{\det(A+K)}{\det(B+K)} =\frac{\det(K+I_n+u_A u_A^\top)}{\det(K+I_n+u_B u_B^\top)} =\frac{(1+u_A^\top(K+I_n)^{-1} u_A)\det(K+I_n)}{(1+u_B^\top(K+I_n)^{-1} u_B)\det(K+I_n)}=\frac{1+u_A^\top(K+I_n)^{-1} u_A}{1+u_B^\top(K+I_n)^{-1} u_B}$$ where the third equality holds due to the identity $\det(X+uv^\top)=(1+u^\top X^{-1}v)\det X$ . My attempts and Questions (Question 1) Through numerical experiments in Matlab, I found candidate bounds that seem to work for various versions of $K$ (the Matlab code can be found below).  So my question is: is the following statement true for all $n$ and $K$ (any symmetric positive definite matrix with only positive entries)? I. If $m_B<m_A$ , then \begin{align*} \det (A^{-1}B) \leq  \det\left[ (B+K)^{-1} (A+K) \right]  \leq  \det (B^{-1}A) \end{align*} II. If $m_B>m_A$ , then \begin{align*} \det (B^{-1}A)  \leq  \det\left[ (B+K)^{-1} (A+K) \right]  \leq  \det (A^{-1}B) \end{align*} or equivalently, I. If $m_B<m_A$ , then \begin{align*} \frac{1+m_B}{1+m_A}  \leq \frac{1+u_A^\top(K+I_n)^{-1} u_A}{1+u_B^\top(K+I_n)^{-1} u_B} \leq  \frac{1+m_A}{1+m_B} \end{align*} II. If $m_B>m_A$ , then \begin{align*} \frac{1+m_A}{1+m_B}  \leq  \frac{1+u_A^\top(K+I_n)^{-1} u_A}{1+u_B^\top(K+I_n)^{-1} u_B} \leq  \frac{1+m_B}{1+m_A}  \end{align*} where $\frac{1+m_A}{1+m_B}\approx \frac{1+a\times n}{1+b \times n}=\frac{1/n + a}{1/n +b}$ and $\frac{1+m_B}{1+m_A} \approx \frac{1/n+b}{1/n+a}$ are $O(1)$ , so the inequalities would imply that $\det\left[ (B+K)^{-1} (A+K) \right]=O(1)$ which is my goal. (Question 2) Are there any other bounds for $\det\left[ (B+K)^{-1} (A+K) \right]$ that are $O(1)$ (possibly obvious bounds that I am missing)? Note I initially thought a sharper bound by $1$ might be possible, but it was not. Suppose $m_B<m_A$ . It is not guaranteed that $u_A^T(K+I_n)^{-1}u_A -u_B^T(K+I_n)^{-1}u_B \geq 0$ . To see this, for instance, consider the example provided here with the matrix $$K = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1\\ 1 & 100 & 99\\ 1 & 99 & 100\\ \end{bmatrix}, \\ $$ and the vectors $u_A = (0, 1, 1)$ and $u_B =(0, 0, 1)$ . This means that the sharper lower bound by $1$ : \begin{align*} \frac{1+m_B}{1+m_A}  < 1 \leq \frac{1+u_A^T(K+I_n)^{-1}u_A}{1+u_B^T(K+I_n)^{-1}u_B} \end{align*} is not possible. However, the proposed bounds by $\frac{1+m_B}{1+m_A}$ and $\frac{1+m_A}{1+m_B}$ still work even with the $K$ , $u_A$ , and $u_B$ in the example above. Code Matlab code for a fixed $n$ : % 1.

I'm reading about the LU decomposition on this page and cannot understand one of the final steps in the proof to the following: Let $A$ be a $K\times K$ matrix. Then, there exists a permutation matrix $P$ such that $PA$ has an LU decomposition: $$PA=LU$$ where $L$ is a lower triangular $K\times K$ matrix and $U$ is an upper triangular $K\times K$ matrix. I'll reproduce the proof here: Through Gaussian elimination, $A$ can be reduced to a row-echelon (hence upper triangular) matrix $U$ via a series of $n$ elementary operations: $$E_n\bullet\ldots\bullet E_1\bullet A = U$$ Any elementary matrix $E_i$ used in Gaussian elimination is either a permutation matrix $P_i$ or a matrix $L_i$ used to add a multiple of one row to a row below it. Thus, $L_i$ will be lower triangular with non-zero diagonal $\implies$ invertible. Suppose that the first permutation matrix we encounter is in position $j$ , so that we have: $$E_n\bullet\ldots\bullet E_{j+1}\bullet P_j\bullet L_{j-1}\bullet\ldots\bullet L_1\bullet A = U$$ Since a permutation matrix is orthogonal, $P_j^T P_j = I$ and hence $$E_n\bullet\ldots\bullet E_{j+1}\bullet P_j\bullet L_{j-1}\bullet P_j^TP_j \bullet\ldots\bullet P_j^TP_j\bullet L_1\bullet P_j^TP_j\bullet A = U$$ or $$E_n\bullet\ldots\bullet E_{j+1}\bullet\tilde{L}_{j-1}\bullet\ldots\bullet\tilde{L}_1\bullet P_j\bullet A = U$$ for $i=1,\ldots,j-1$ . A matrix $L_i$ , used to add $\alpha$ times the $i$ -th row to the $s$ -th row (in this case $s>i$ ), can be written as a rank one update to the identity matrix: $L_i=I+M$ , where $M$ is a matrix whose entries are all zeros except $M_{si} = \alpha$ . We have that $$\tilde{L}_i = P_jL_iP_j^T = P_j(I+M)P_j^T = P_jP_j^T + P_jMP_j^T = I+P_jMP_j^T$$ So far so good. Then we have: The permutations performed on the rows and columns of $M$ by $P_j$ and $P_j^T$ can move the only non-zero element of $M$ , but that element remains below the main diagonal (because $j>i$ ).

69,Question related to the trace and the commutator of matrices,Question related to the trace and the commutator of matrices,,"Let $K$ be any field and $n\in \mathbb N$ . For every $A\in M_n(K)$ , define a linear form $\lambda_A: M_n(K) \rightarrow K$ by sending the matrix $M$ to $\lambda_A(M):= \operatorname{Tr}(AM)$ . The map $\lambda: M_n(K) \rightarrow M_n(K)^*$ defined this way is an isomorphism, as can be seen from injectivity and equality of dimensions (which are finite). The question is the following. Let $A, B\in M_n(K)$ be two matrices such that for every $M\in M_n(K)$ that commutes with $A$ (that is, such that $AM=MA$ ), we have $\lambda_B(M)=0$ . Prove that $B=AC-CA$ for some matrix $C\in M_n(K)$ . The reciprocal being clearly true, the statement above in fact exactly characterizes all the matrices that can be written as $AC-CA$ for some matrix $C\in M_n(K)$ . As a preliminary question, I managed to show that $$\operatorname{Ker}(\operatorname{Tr})=\operatorname{Span}\{AB-BA\,|\,A,B\in M_n(K)\}$$ The inclusion of the right-hand space - which I call $E$ - inside the kernel is indeed clear. However, it may not be clear that the right-hand space is a hyperplane. If we assumed it were not, we may find another hyperplane $H$ such that $E\subset H$ , and $H\not = \operatorname{Ker}(\operatorname{Tr})$ . The hyperplane $H$ is the kernel of some linear form which is linearly independant on $\operatorname{Tr}$ . It can be uniquely written as $\lambda_X$ for some matrix $X\in M_n(K)$ which is not a multiple of the identity matrix $I_n$ . However, the condition that $\lambda_X$ vanishes on $E$ implies that $X$ is a multiple of the identity, so we get a contradiction. Hence, $E$ is a hyperplane and so by equality of dimensions, we must have the equality above (note that the kernel of $\operatorname{Tr}$ is never trivial). I have been trying to solve the problem using this result, however I can't progress further. Taking $M=I_n$ , we may express $B$ as $XY-YX$ for some matrices $X,Y \in M_n(K)$ . Considering $A$ , we may also express $BA$ as a commutator. But the problem is that we have no idea what these commutators would look like. In particular, I can't think of any way to prove that one of the matrices could be $A$ . Could you please give me any hint/advices that could lead me to the solution?","Let be any field and .

Intuitively I imagine the maximum numbers are achieved if we take a matrix of all $1$ s and start putting in zeroes, starting with entries $(1,2), (1,3), \ldots, (1,n)$ so the only nonzero entry in that row is at $(1,1)$ , and then moving to the next row and putting zeroes in $(2,1), (2,3), \ldots, (2,n)$ so the only nonzero entry in that row is at $(2,2)$ , and so on until we're filling in zeroes on the last row at $(n,1), (n,2), \ldots, (n,n-1)$ .
