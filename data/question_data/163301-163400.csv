In words: $\lambda^*$ is the Lebesgue outer measure, which is the infimum of the total length of all countable collections of intervals that cover $A$. Technical points: the collection uses open intervals, and they are required to be nonempty. Also, by ""countable"" I mean ""denumerable"" (no finite collections allowed). Thus, for example, $0$ is never in that set. But since it is an infimum, this is probably not an issue. Note that the infinite sum may possibly be $+\infty$; this is handled correctly (it is really the supremum of the partial sums over the extended reals, although I didn't write that above). $\lambda$ is the Lebesgue measure, which is just the outer measure restricted to those sets which split any other set into disjoint pieces that add up to the whole. Technical points: we can only do this for those sets whose outer measure is finite, or else the addition is undefined (addition is not defined on the extended reals). I think this should still give the same result as if the quantifier ranged over all sets (which is the usual way of stating this). We write ""$A$ is measurable"" as ""$A\in{\rm dom}\ \lambda$"". The $\alpha$ functions are a recursive definition of the Lebesgue integral over simple functions. All the $\alpha$ functions, as well as $\int_1$ and $\int_2$, are ""integration"" functions: they map functions (with domain $\Bbb R$ and range $\Bbb [0,\infty]$) to real numbers. I had to write out the $\alpha$ functions explicitly as sets of ordered pairs here. $\alpha_0$ has a singleton domain (the zero function) and maps it to zero; $\alpha_{n+1}$ is the collection of all function-value pairs formed by taking a function $g$ from $\alpha_n$, a positive real coefficient $x$, and a measurable set $A$, and forming the new function $z\in\Bbb R\mapsto g(z)+{\rm if}(z\in A,x,0)$ and giving it the value $\alpha_n(g)+x\lambda(A)$. Since the coefficient is strictly positive, the only time $\alpha_{n+1}$ and $\alpha_n$ use the same function is when the set $A$ is empty, in which case $\lambda(A)=0$ and the functions agree. Thus the $\alpha$ functions are compatible and their union $\int_1$ is the desired simple function integrator. $\int_2$ is an integrator over nonnegative extended real functions; it is the supremum of all simple functions less than it. Technical note: this can be $+\infty$ if the function is bounded away from zero or takes the value $+\infty$ (which is allowed) on a set of positive measure. The final full integral (written in the usual notation) is just the sum of $\int_2$ evaluated at the positive and negative real and imaginary pieces of the function, and with a region limiter tacked on for convenience. Comments about this setup are welcome. But I also have a question: nowhere above was the concept of integrability mentioned. Obviously there will be an issue if any of the four $\int_2$ integrals evaluates to $\infty$ (recall that addition is not defined for $\pm\infty$), but other than that in what ways can this definition be misused? In particular, I see no reason for the concept of a ""measurable function"" to be needed; all of the expressions are perfectly well-defined for a non-measurable function, unless I am missing something. Is there some ""basic property"" that is absolutely essential that only works for measurable functions?

In words: $\lambda^*$ is the Lebesgue outer measure, which is the infimum of the total length of all countable collections of intervals that cover $A$. Technical points: the collection uses open intervals, and they are required to be nonempty. Also, by ""countable"" I mean ""denumerable"" (no finite collections allowed). Thus, for example, $0$ is never in that set. But since it is an infimum, this is probably not an issue. Note that the infinite sum may possibly be $+\infty$; this is handled correctly (it is really the supremum of the partial sums over the extended reals, although I didn't write that above). $\lambda$ is the Lebesgue measure, which is just the outer measure restricted to those sets which split any other set into disjoint pieces that add up to the whole. Technical points: we can only do this for those sets whose outer measure is finite, or else the addition is undefined (addition is not defined on the extended reals). I think this should still give the same result as if the quantifier ranged over all sets (which is the usual way of stating this). We write ""$A$ is measurable"" as ""$A\in{\rm dom}\ \lambda$"". The $\alpha$ functions are a recursive definition of the Lebesgue integral over simple functions. All the $\alpha$ functions, as well as $\int_1$ and $\int_2$, are ""integration"" functions: they map functions (with domain $\Bbb R$ and range $\Bbb [0,\infty]$) to real numbers. I had to write out the $\alpha$ functions explicitly as sets of ordered pairs here. $\alpha_0$ has a singleton domain (the zero function) and maps it to zero; $\alpha_{n+1}$ is the collection of all function-value pairs formed by taking a function $g$ from $\alpha_n$, a positive real coefficient $x$, and a measurable set $A$, and forming the new function $z\in\Bbb R\mapsto g(z)+{\rm if}(z\in A,x,0)$ and giving it the value $\alpha_n(g)+x\lambda(A)$. Since the coefficient is strictly positive, the only time $\alpha_{n+1}$ and $\alpha_n$ use the same function is when the set $A$ is empty, in which case $\lambda(A)=0$ and the functions agree. Thus the $\alpha$ functions are compatible and their union $\int_1$ is the desired simple function integrator. $\int_2$ is an integrator over nonnegative extended real functions; it is the supremum of all simple functions less than it. Technical note: this can be $+\infty$ if the function is bounded away from zero or takes the value $+\infty$ (which is allowed) on a set of positive measure. The final full integral (written in the usual notation) is just the sum of $\int_2$ evaluated at the positive and negative real and imaginary pieces of the function, and with a region limiter tacked on for convenience. Comments about this setup are welcome. But I also have a question: nowhere above was the concept of integrability mentioned. Obviously there will be an issue if any of the four $\int_2$ integrals evaluates to $\infty$ (recall that addition is not defined for $\pm\infty$), but other than that in what ways can this definition be misused? In particular, I see no reason for the concept of a ""measurable function"" to be needed; all of the expressions are perfectly well-defined for a non-measurable function, unless I am missing something. Is there some ""basic property"" that is absolutely essential that only works for measurable functions? And if you have a measurable function and all four integrals are finite, are we clear to call the function ""(Lebesgue) integrable""?",,"['real-analysis', 'measure-theory', 'lebesgue-measure']"

40,What is the density of the SRB measure conditioned to unstable manifolds?,What is the density of the SRB measure conditioned to unstable manifolds?,,"I have a question regarding the SRB measure. As Lai-Sang Young puts it, the SRB-measure is the invariant ergodic invariant measure most compatible with volume. (see [ http://www.cims.nyu.edu/~lsy/papers/SRBsurvey.pdf ]). More precisely, let $\Phi\colon \Gamma\to\Gamma$ be a $C^1$ Anosov diffeomorphism of a compact Riemannian manifold $\Gamma$ to itself. In that case, at any $x \in \Gamma$ the tangent space $\mathrm{T}x$ can be split into $\mathrm D \Phi$-invariant stable and unstable subspaces $E_u$ and $E_s$, such that $\mathrm{D}\Phi\vert_{E_u}$ and $\mathrm{D}\Phi\vert_{E_s}$ are uniformly expanding and contracting, respectively. Now the unstable manifold $W^\epsilon_u(x)$ of a point $x$ is the set of all points $y$ such that for any $n \in \mathbb N$ we have $d(\Phi^{-n}x,\Phi^{-n}y)<\epsilon$, where $d$ is the Riemannian metric. In other words, it consists of points with a similar ""past"" than $x$. Let $w$ be a local unstable manifold, $\lambda_w$ the volume induced on $w$ by the Riemannian volume on $\Gamma$.

Can we also conclude that for the distributional derivative it holds that \begin{equation} Dw(\cdot)=D\chi_Bu(\cdot)=Du(\,\cdot \cap B) ? \end{equation} I started with noting that similarly $\tilde w \colon = u \chi_{B^c} \in BV(\Theta)$ and so $\forall \phi \in C_c^{1}(\Theta)$ and $i=1, \dots n:$ \begin{align*} -\int_{\Theta} \phi \, dD_iu &= \int_{\Theta} u \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x_i} \, dx = \int_{\Theta} w \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x_i} \, dx + \int_{\Theta} \tilde w \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x_i} \,  dx \\ &= -\int_{ \Theta} \phi \, d D_iw -\int_{ \Theta} \phi \, d D_i\tilde w = - \int_{ \Theta} \phi \, d ( \underbrace{D_iw  + D_i \tilde w}_{=D_i\left( w + \tilde w \right)} ) \\ &= -\int_{\Theta} \phi \, d\left(D_i(w+\tilde w) \right) \end{align*}  and therefore $D_i w + D_i \tilde w = D_i(w+ \tilde w) = D_i u = D_i u(\cdot \cap B )+ D_i u(\cdot \cap B^c ),$ from which we get $D_i w = D_i u(\cdot \cap B )$ and analogously $D_i \tilde w = D_i u (\cdot \cap B )$ for any  $i,$ i.e. \begin{equation} Dw = Du (\cdot \cap B ), \qquad D \tilde w = D u (\cdot \cap B^c ). \end{equation} Or should I write $Dw(\cdot \cap B) = Du (\cdot \cap B )$ and analogously for tilde?

That is, $\mathfrak{M}$ need NOT to be the set of all borel sets, hence $m$ is possibly somewhat stronger than Borel measure. Are these Lebesgue measures actually the same? Or are they consistent? For example, i have learned two different definitions of Riemann-Stieltjes Integration and one of them is strictly stronger than another. Let's say $m_1$ is a Lebesgue measure constructed by using codable Borel sets and $m_2$ is the Lebesgue measure described above in the example. If a function $f$ is integrable with respect to $m_1$, then is $f$ integrable with respect to $m_2$?",,"['real-analysis', 'measure-theory']"

Usually the collection K is built by considering a collection P over real valued functions satisfying some propetry and intersecting it with the collections of bounded functions. Then using MCT with a nice space H, you have your conclusion for $\sigma(K)$. My question is the follwing is there a general way or sufficient conditions to see if $\sigma(K)=\sigma(P)$. There is a trivial inclusion so the question is better stated as under what conditions does $\sigma(P) \subset \sigma(K)$ holds ? The motivation behind this question comes from the fact that when I see MCT used in proofs of theorems, it is often the case that the theorem's conclusion is stated for the unbounded real valued functions collection P rather than K (P+the bounded property).
