The Lemma I am confused about can be found on page $76$ . It wants to show that for any $p \in M$ there exists an open neighbourhood $V$ of $0$ in $T_pM$ and $U$ of $p$ in $M$ such that $\mathrm{exp}_p:V \to U$ is a diffeomorphism. The proof goes as follows. First identify $T_pM \cong T_0(T_pM)$ and compute $\mathrm{exp}_p(V)$ for a tangent vector $V \in T_pM$ . Show that this is equal to $V$ under this identification and use the inverse function theorem. So as far as I can see it, one first has to note that in general $\mathrm{exp}_p$ is only defined on $$\{v \in T_pM \ | \ c_v \ \text{is defined on an interval containing} \ [0,1]\},$$ where $c_v$ denotes the geodesic with $\dot{c}_v(0)=v.$ However, one wants to compute the composition $$T_pM \to T_0(T_pM) \to T_pM$$ where the first map is given by the identification and the second map is given by $d(\mathrm{exp}_p)_p.$ Now, since $\mathrm{exp}_p$ is differentiable one can define the differential of that map, but why is it defined on $T_0(T_pM)$ even though $\mathrm{exp}_p$ is not defined on the entire tangent space $T_pM$ ? Furthermore, I fear that this is rather trivial, but what exactly is the identification map $T_pM \cong T_0(T_pM)$ ? And why does $$(\mathrm{exp}_p)_*V=\left.\frac{d}{dt}\right\vert_{t=0}(\mathrm{exp}_p \circ \tau)(t)$$ hold, where $(\mathrm{exp}_p)_*$ is defined as the composition of the exponential map with the identification above and $\tau(t)=tV.$ Is $V$ viewed as a derivation or a geometric tangent vector here?

At first I thought the information given i.e. $\cos(3P)+ \cos(3Q)+ \cos(3R) = 1$ to be a distraction and I went with the usual way to solve this problem that sum of two sides is always greater than the third side. So; $15+18>\sqrt{m}$ $\Rightarrow m<1089$ So highest value that $m$ can take is $1088$ but this was the wrong answer. Then I used the cosine rule as follows :- $\cos P=\frac{15^2+18^2-m}{2.15.18}$ $\Rightarrow -1 \le \frac{15^2+18^2-m}{2.15.18} \le1 $ $\Rightarrow9 \le m \le1089$ So from here I got the highest value of $m$ to be 1089 but this was also wrong.

80,Probability that the orthographic projection of a randomly oriented regular tetrahedron is a triangle,Probability that the orthographic projection of a randomly oriented regular tetrahedron is a triangle,,"I wanted to find the probability that, given a uniformly sampled rotation matrix , when applied to a regular tetrahedron, its orthographic projection is a triangle (instead of a quadrilateral) when viewed from a predetermined ""camera angle"". Here is my approach. First, some definitions and convenient choices: The regular tetrahedron has side length $a$ be centered at the origin. We are looking at it from the positive $z$ axis. Thus we are projecting the tetrahedron onto the $xy$ -plane. Given a triangular projection, let the triangle's vertices be $A, B, C$ . The fourth vertex of the tetrahedron is $D$ . Assume for now WLOG that $D$ is obscured by the face $\triangle ABC$ . I want to calculate how much area on the tetrahedron's circumsphere can be reached by $D$ through rotation without $D$ 's projection ever exiting the projection of $\triangle ABC$ . Dividing that by the total surface area would give the probability. To start, let us start with the tetrahedron being oriented such that $\triangle ABC$ is parallel to the $xy$ -plane, and $AB$ (the edge) is parallel to the $x$ -axis. Let $\theta = \phi = 0$ (spherical coordinates) at this orientation, as this describes the position of $D$ . What I want to do, is for each value of $\theta$ , where $0 \leq \theta \leq \pi/3$ (I chose this range since I believe the math to be symmetric enough to do on 1/6 of a full rotation), rotate the tetrahedron about the $z$ -axis by $\theta$ , then determine how much I can rotate the tetrahedron clockwise (as seen from positive $x$ ) about the $x$ axis without having vertex $D$ exit $\triangle ABC$ . To help explain the next step, I will use the figures below. Figures 1 through 4 are viewed from the positive $z$ -axis, Figure 5 is viewed from the positive $x$ -axis. See Figure 4 for what the rotation by $\theta$ mentioned earlier looks like, and Figures 1-3 for concrete examples. In Figure 4, there is a point $P$ on the edge $AB$ , and line segment $PD$ . See Figure 5 for a partial view of Figure 4 from the positive $x$ -axis. If we are rotating clockwise about the $x$ -axis, then we cannot rotate further once $PD$ becomes parallel to the $z$ -axis. That is, when the projections of $P$ and $D$ would coincide. Thus, the value $\alpha$ in Figure 5 is the most we can rotate about the $x$ -axis for this particular value of $\alpha$ . In particular, the value of $\phi$ ranges from $0$ to $\alpha$ . To get $\alpha$ as a function of $\theta$ , note that $|EF| = \sqrt{3}a/6$ is the inradius of $\triangle ABC$ , and so $|PF| = |EF| \sec \theta = (\sqrt{3}a \sec \theta)/6$ . As $|DF| = \sqrt{6}a/3$ is the height of the tetrahedron and $\tan \alpha = |PF|/|DF|$ , we have $$\alpha(\theta) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{|PF|}{|DF|}\right) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{6}a \sec \theta}{\frac{\sqrt{6}}{3}a}\right) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\sec \theta}{2 \sqrt{2}}\right).$$ We now prepare to integrate in spherical coordinates. The differential for the surface area of the sphere is $dA = R^2 \cos \theta \; d\phi \; d\theta$ where $R$ is the circumradius of the tetrahedron. Using this information, the area that $D$ can reach when $\theta \in [0, \pi/3]$ is $$A_{\pi/3} = \int_0^{\pi/3}\int_0^{\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\sec \theta}{2 \sqrt{2}}\right)} R^2 \cos \theta \; d \phi \; d \theta.$$ The total area reachable for $\theta \in [0, 2 \pi)$ is $6$ times this value due to symmetry. But, we need to multiply by an additional factor of $2$ to account for the case when $D$ is in front of $\triangle ABC$ (the math should be the same). As the surface area of the circumsphere is $4 \pi R^2$ , the final probability is $$P = \frac{12A_{\pi/3}}{4 \pi R^2} = \frac{3}{\pi} \int_0^{\pi/3}\int_0^{\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\sec \theta}{2 \sqrt{2}}\right)} \cos \theta \; d \phi \; d \theta \approx 0.33222.$$ The only problem is, from numerical results, I am getting a probability of about $0.35$ , so there is a mistake here somewhere, probably with the procedure itself. But that is the approach I came up with, so what I would like to ask is whether this approach solves the problem at all, and if you have a better idea, whether it be a correction/improvement to mine or something else entirely.","I wanted to find the probability that, given a uniformly sampled rotation matrix , when applied to a regular tetrahedron, its orthographic projection is a triangle (instead of a quadrilateral) when viewed from a predetermined ""camera angle"". Here is my approach. First, some definitions and convenient choices: The regular tetrahedron has side length be centered at the origin. We are looking at it from the positive axis. Thus we are projecting the tetrahedron onto the -plane. Given a triangular projection, let the triangle's vertices be . The fourth vertex of the tetrahedron is . Assume for now WLOG that is obscured by the face . I want to calculate how much area on the tetrahedron's circumsphere can be reached by through rotation without 's projection ever exiting the projection of . Dividing that by the total surface area would give the probability. To start, let us start with the tetrahedron being oriented such that is parallel to the -plane, and (the edge) is parallel to the -axis. Let (spherical coordinates) at this orientation, as this describes the position of . What I want to do, is for each value of , where (I chose this range since I believe the math to be symmetric enough to do on 1/6 of a full rotation), rotate the tetrahedron about the -axis by , then determine how much I can rotate the tetrahedron clockwise (as seen from positive ) about the axis without having vertex exit . To help explain the next step, I will use the figures below. Figures 1 through 4 are viewed from the positive -axis, Figure 5 is viewed from the positive -axis. See Figure 4 for what the rotation by mentioned earlier looks like, and Figures 1-3 for concrete examples. In Figure 4, there is a point on the edge , and line segment . See Figure 5 for a partial view of Figure 4 from the positive -axis. If we are rotating clockwise about the -axis, then we cannot rotate further once becomes parallel to the -axis. That is, when the projections of and would coincide. Thus, the value in Figure 5 is the most we can rotate about the -axis for this particular value of . In particular, the value of ranges from to . To get as a function of , note that is the inradius of , and so . As is the height of the tetrahedron and , we have We now prepare to integrate in spherical coordinates. The differential for the surface area of the sphere is where is the circumradius of the tetrahedron.

And an angle $x$ is constructible iff $\cos x$ meets the same conditions.  My question is, for marked ruler and compass, a number is constructible iff what? Must we merely impose the condition that $[K_{i} :K_{i+1}] = 2$ or $3$ ? Can you give an explanation and proof please? Edit: To be more specific, the ruler is marked with only points that may be constructed with compass and unmarked straightedge, and points that may be constructed with ruler and compass. This may also be relevant: we only allow verging between lines, not lines and curves or curves and curves.","I know that for unmarked ruler and compass a number (distance) is constructible from iff it lies in a finite tower of field extensions , where for all .
