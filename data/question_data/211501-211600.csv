If there are 4 girls and 4 boys going to a movie theatre, in how many different arrangements could they sit together if… a) the first and last seats were occupied by girls and b) all the girls want to sit together? And this is what I have done: a) There are 4 girls, and the first and last spaces are taken by girls in 4P2 (nPr) ways. After the 2 girls have taken a seat, there are now 6! ways in which the rest of the group can sit (4 boys and 2 girls remaining). Meaning the total number of ways for them to be seated in 4P2 * 6! (I'm not sure if this is correct) b) All the girls want to sit together this time. If we take all 4 of the girls as one entity then we will have 4 + 1 = 5 total entities to shuffle around.

5,Turn a maximal preflow into a maximal flow in $O(mn)$,Turn a maximal preflow into a maximal flow in,O(mn),"I have to prove that you can turn a maximal preflow (so a preflow, such that the excess of our sink $t$ is maximal) into a maximal flow in $O(mn)$ time. My first idea was, to take an active node $v$ (which means a node which has positve excess) and randomly decrease the costs of the incoming edges of $v$ , until the excess equals $0$ . We do that, until there are no active nodes left. However, I am not sure if that already creates a maximal flow. This procedure would be in $O(mn)$ , since we iterate over a maximum of $n$ nodes (where $n := |V(G)|$ ), and in the worst case, every cost of an edge has to be reduced. The problem is, that I don't quite see, why the resulting flow should be maximal. It would be maximal, if there were no more paths from the source $s$ to the sink $t$ , but why is this the case here? Maybe, the costs of the edges have to be reduced in a specific way instead of randomly? Can someone give me some advice? Thanks in advance! Edit: I read something about the Push-Relabel algorithm which basically functions very similar. A better idea would be, to first turn our preflow to an acyclic preflow. This way, we can get a topological order of all nodes, lets say $\{v_1, ... v_n\}$ , with $v_1 := t$ and $v_n := s$ . Now, we go from $v_2$ to $v_{n-1}$ in the topological order, and check, whether the excess is positive. If it is positive, then we just decrease the incoming flow by reducing the flow on the incoming edges (randomly), until the excess is $0$ . This way, only the excess of the next nodes can be affected, so by iterating over all nodes $v_2$ to $v_{n-1}$ , the end result will be a flow $f'$ . This flow also has the same value as of our preflow, since the incoming edges to the node $t$ didn't change. Since $f$ was a maximal preflow, it follows that $f'$ must be a maximal flow as well. This sounds like a promising idea, sadly, I do not know how to turn our preflow acyclic. I mean, finding a cycle is possible, but how do I know, which edges can be deleted? It has to be possible in $O(nm)$ , since the other steps are in $O(nm)$ as well.","I have to prove that you can turn a maximal preflow (so a preflow, such that the excess of our sink is maximal) into a maximal flow in time.

We take the usual convention that a simplex changes sign under an odd permutation of its indices, which in the authors' notation is written as $$(\mathcal{P}(i_0), \cdots \mathcal{P}(i_p)) = \mathrm{sgn}(\mathcal{P}) (i_0, \cdots, i_p)$$ If I understand correctly, each field should be invariant under reordering of the indices, and thus we conclude that each of the field ""tensor"" components should be fully anti-symmetric, ""The summations include each simplex only once. Thus the square bracket $[\cdots]$ denotes one representative of an equivalence class related by exchange of indices."" Now this is the part I am confused about, the authors state: Renumbering the vertex set of $\mathcal{G}$ [(the underlying graph)] is a formal symmetry which cannot have physical consequences. Reversing the vertex ordering changes the sign of $p$ -simplices with odd $p$ , so it changes the sign of the components for $p$ -fields with $p=1$ and 3. Thus by analogy with the parities of continuum fields with respect to coordinate inversion, we classify the basic $p$ -field quantities as 0-fields (scalars), 1-fields (polar vectors), 2-fields (axial vectors), and 3-fields (pseudoscalars). I am not able to figure out precisely what this means since they do not give examples. My understanding is this: Assume we label every vertex with an index $\{1,2,\cdots\}$ , then we can take for each representative of the equivalence classes the one in which the indices are in ascending order, i.e. we choose the representative 2-simplex of the equivalence class $[i_0,i_1,i_2]$ to be $(i_{n_0}, i_{n_1}, i_{n_2})$ where $i_{n_0} < i_{n_1} < i_{n_2}$ and $\{n_0,n_1,n_2\}$ is a permutation of $\{0,1,2\}$ (apologies, I realize this notation is rather cumbersome but I hope I made my point). Now, when the authors say ""reversing the vertex ordering"", I am not sure what they mean. If the graph is finite, and the list of labels ends, $\{0,1,\cdots, N\}$ , then I would assume they mean relabel each vertex $i \rightarrow N-i$ , but I cannot figure out how to recover their statement that this changes the sign of $p$ -simplices with odd $p$ . Every simplex now has an ordering which is descending rather than ascending, but then I find $$(1) \rightarrow (1) = +(1)$$ $$(1,2) \rightarrow (2,1) = -(1,2)$$ $$(1,2,3) \rightarrow (3,2,1) = -(1,2,3)$$ $$(1,2,3,4) \rightarrow (4,3,2,1) = +(1,2,3,4)$$ which is not the statement the authors make, I am expecting to find that the signs alternate as $+,-,+,-$ .

Solution attempt From the given congruences for $y$ , it follows that: $$m_1x + b_1 \equiv m_2x + b_2 \pmod p$$ Adding $-m_2x-b_1$ to both sides: $$m_1x - m_2x \equiv b_2 - b_1 \pmod p$$ $$(m_1 - m_2)x \equiv b_2 - b_1 \pmod p$$ Since $m_1 \not\equiv m_2 \pmod p$ , then $m_1 - m_2 \not\equiv 0 \pmod p$ . Since $p$ is a prime, this implies that $\mathrm{gcd}(m_1 - m_2, p) = 1$ . Therefore, the multiplicative inverse of $m_1 - m_2$ modulo $p$ exists. Call it $r$ . Multiplying both sides of the above congruence by $r$ : $$x \equiv (b_2 - b_1) r \pmod p$$ $y$ can then be found by substituting the above expression for $x$ in one of the original congruences. Substituting it in $y \equiv m_1x + b_1 \pmod p$ : $$y \equiv m_1((b_2 - b_1) r) + b_1 \pmod p$$ The value of $r$ can be found as follows: since $\mathrm{gcd}(m_1 - m_2, p) = 1$ , then, by Bézout's lemma, $a(m_1 - m_2) + bp = 1$ for some $a$ , $b$ (the values of $a$ and $b$ can be calculated using the extended Euclidean algorithm). Then, it follows that: $$a(m_1 - m_2) + bp \equiv 1 \pmod p$$ $$a(m_1 - m_2) \equiv 1 \pmod p$$ The above means that $a$ (or any other integer that is congruent to $a$ modulo $p$ ) is an inverse modulo $p$ of $m_1 - m_2$ . So, let $r = a$ , and the expressions for $x$ and $y$ become: $$x \equiv (b_2 - b_1) a \pmod p$$ $$y \equiv m_1(b_2 - b_1) a + b_1 \pmod p$$ Could someone verify if my attempt is correct?

Improve this question So the question is to construct a best case example for Quick Sort with 15 elements n = 15, hopefully somebody could give me a second opinion to whether this is the best case for this Quick Sort implementation. The way the algo works for this exercise is that pivot will always be the last element. Now as you will see in the picture we have a (j). (j) will be at first position initially. If value at that position is smaller than pivot, it will move to next element.(what actually happen is that it switches with the element itself but since the element is at same position nothing happened). Now if let say the value at (j) is larger than pivot then (j) stays where it is waiting for next element that is smaller than pivot then (j) and that element will switch. Lastly, the pivot will switch position with the j element. You may wonder why we still consider for when p(begining element) == q (last element) but that is just the way this exercise is Ex:(G(1,1), G(3,3),...) in these case we still call the function but will do nothing. Hint teacher gave was: best case has to do with the least number of exchanges in a partition when comparing with the pivot M.

I'm looking for asymptotically correct bounds on the mixing time of this random walk, where mixing is defined in terms of total variation distance as in Markov Chains and Mixing Times by Levin and Peres. A coordinate-wise coupling argument (à la that given in the solution to exercise 5.4 in MC&MT) gives that for any $\varepsilon>0$ , the mixing time $t_{\text{mix}}(\varepsilon)$ is at most $\frac{1}{\log(4)}n^{3}\log(n/\varepsilon)$ , where the logs are natural logs. This is of the right order, but I believe that the constant $1/\log(4)$ is too big. Using a slight generalization of Wilson's Method (see section 13.5 of the text), I obtained that for any $\varepsilon>0$ , the mixing time $t_{\text{mix}}(\varepsilon)$ is at least $(1-o(1))\frac{1}{2\pi^{2}}n^{3}\log(n).$ Based on the mixing times of related chains, I think the constant $\frac{1}{2\pi^{2}}$ at least has the right ""flavor,"" if it isn't already correct.

Assume $f$ is not injective, and $g$ is any total function from $D$ to $D$ . Since $f$ is not injective, there must be $x_0,x_1,y_0 \in D$ such that $x_0 \neq x_1$ and $f(x_0) = f(x_1) = y_0$ . Then, we have that: $g(f(x_0)) = g(y_0)$ and $g(f(x_1)) = g(y_0)$ . Note that, since $g$ is total, we know that $g(y_0)$ exists. From the above, $g(f(x_0)) = g(f(x_1))$ . To show that this implies that there must be an $x$ such that $g(f(x)) \neq x$ , there are two cases: Case 1.1. If $x_0 \neq g(y_0)$ , then $g(f(x_0)) = g(y_0) \neq x_0$ . So, $x_0$ is an $x$ such that $g(f(x)) \neq x$ . Case 1.2. If $x_0 = g(y_0)$ , then $g(f(x_1)) = g(y_0) = x_0$ . However, since $x_0 \neq x_1$ , this means that $g(f(x_1)) \neq x_1$ . So, $x_1$ is an $x$ such that $g(f(x)) \neq x$ . So, either way, there is an $x$ such that $g(f(x)) \neq x$ . Now, I show the other direction of the equivalence: If $f$ is injective, then $\exists g \forall x\ g(f(x)) = x$ . Assume $f$ is total and injective. I will construct a $g$ such that $g$ is total and $\forall x\ g(f(x)) = x$ . First, note that, since $f$ is total and injective, $f^{-1}$ is a surjective function, and $f^{-1}(x) = x$ for all $x$ in $f(D)$ . So, for all $x$ where $f^{-1}(x)$ is defined, $g$ can be defined as $f^{-1}(x)$ . However, $f^{-1}$ is not necessarily total, and $g$ needs to be total. To complete the definition of $g$ , we need to define it for all $x \in D$ for which $f^{-1}(x)$ is not defined. For example, we can define $g(x) = x$ for all $x$ such that $f^{-1}(x)$ is not defined. So, $g$ can be constructed as: $g = \left\{\begin{matrix}f^{-1}(x) & \text{ if }f^{-1}(x)\text{ is defined}\\x & \text{ if }f^{-1}(x)\text{ is not defined}\end{matrix}\right.$ Is this correct?

Define Property m : For any nonnegative integer less than $2^{m+1}$ , there is a selection of envelopes whose contents add up to exactly that number of dollars. Use the Well Ordering Principle (WOP) to prove that Property m holds for all nonnegative integers m . Hint : Consider two cases: first, when the target number of dollars is less than $2^m$ and second, when the target number is at least $2^m$ . Solution attempt Let's refer to Property m as $P(m)$ to make things simpler. Let $C$ be the following set: $C = \{ m \mid \text{P(m) doesn't hold for } m\}$ Then, by the WOP, there is a smallest integer $m_0$ in $C$ . $P(m)$ holds for m = 0, since any nonnegative integer less than $2^{0+1} = 2$ can be represented with a selection of envelopes (the integer $0$ can be represented by a selection of no envelopes, and the integer $1$ can be represented with the envelope containing $1$ ). So, $m_0 > 0$ . Also, $P(m_0-1)$ holds (since $m_0-1 < m_0$ ), which means that all nonnegative integers less than $2^{m_0}$ can be represented by a selection of envelopes that contain up to $2^{m_0-1}$ . Since $P(m_0)$ is false, this means that there is a nonnegative integer $c$ less than $2^{m_0 + 1}$ such that $c$ can't be obtained by a selection of the envelopes $1$ , $2$ , $4$ , ..., $2^{m_0}$ . From the above paragraph, we know that $c < 2^{m_0+1}$ , and, from the fact that $P(m_0-1)$ holds, we know that $c \geq 2^{m_0}$ . So: $2^{m_0} \leq c < 2^{m_0+1}$ To show that there is a contradiction, there are two cases: If $c$ is even: Dividing the above inequality by 2, $2^{m_0-1} \leq c/2 < 2^{m_0}$ . So, since $c/2$ is smaller than $2^{m_0}$ , $P(c/2)$ holds and $c/2$ can be represented by a selection of envelopes. However, this means that $2(c/2) = c$ can also be represented as a selection of envelopes, which is a contradiction. If $c$ is odd: Subtracting 1 from the above inequality and dividing it by 2, $2^{m_0-1} - 1/2 \leq (c - 1)/2 < 2^{m_0} - 1/2$ . Since $(c - 1)/2$ is smaller than $2^{m_0}$ , $P((c - 1)/2)$ holds and $(c - 1)/2$ can be represented by a selection of envelopes. However, this means that $2((c - 1)/2) + 1 = c$ can also be represented as a selection of envelopes, which is a contradiction. So, $C$ is empty and $P(m)$ holds for all nonnegative integers $m$ .

75,Efficient algorithm to determine which of 2 sums of quantities infinitesimally close to 1 is greater,Efficient algorithm to determine which of 2 sums of quantities infinitesimally close to 1 is greater,,"Let $\gamma$ be infinitesimally close to 1 (or more precisely, let $\gamma=1-\epsilon$ and consider this problem for sufficiently small $\epsilon$ ). Suppose I have two quantities which consist of finite sums of powers of $\gamma$ , for example, $a=\gamma+\gamma^4$ and $b=\gamma^2+\gamma^3$ . Is there an efficient way to determine which of $a$ or $b$ is greater without doing a binomial expansion? (i.e. decide if $a-b>0$ ?) Obviously, if $a$ and $b$ consist of a different number of terms, then whichever has more terms is greater. In this case, however, they both have 2 terms. One straightforward way to decide which is bigger is to expand: $$ a=(1-\epsilon)+(1-\epsilon)^4 = (1-\epsilon)+(1-4\epsilon+6\epsilon^2-4\epsilon^3+\epsilon^4)=2-5\epsilon+6\epsilon^2-4\epsilon^3+\epsilon^4$$ $$b = (1-\epsilon)^2+(1-\epsilon)^3=(1-2\epsilon+\epsilon^2)+(1-3\epsilon+3\epsilon^2-\epsilon^3)=2-5\epsilon+4\epsilon^2-\epsilon^3$$ So for sufficiently small $\epsilon$ , we get $b<a$ since $4\epsilon^2<6\epsilon^2$ . However, ideally I'd like to implement this on a computer efficiently, and in particular, binomial coefficients can grow quite large and require arbitrary precision arithmetic if the array which decides whether the $i$ th power of $\gamma$ is present is large. I was hoping that there would be a straightforward, obvious way to just 'look' at them and decide which is bigger. One constraint I have is that for each $i$ , $\gamma^i$ appears in at most one of $a$ or $b$ with coefficient $0$ or $1$ . One result I discovered is that if we start with $\gamma$ and for the $n$ th power, add or subtract $\gamma^n$ to bring the current sum closer to $0$ , we get the Thue-Morse sequence with the signs. For example: We start with $\gamma$ . Since $\gamma>0$ , subtract $\gamma^2$ . Since $\gamma-\gamma^2>0$ , subtract $\gamma^3$ . Since $\gamma-\gamma^2-\gamma^3<0$ , add $\gamma^4$ etc. The sequence is $\gamma-\gamma^2-\gamma^3+\gamma^4-\gamma^5+\gamma^6+\gamma^7-\gamma^8-\dots$ . Since the Thue-Morse sequence is easy to compute, I was hoping this would give an easy way to generalize this to comparing arbitrary sums of powers of $\gamma$ by comparing them to the Thue-Morse sequence.
