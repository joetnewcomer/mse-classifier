10,Finite group with elements of given order,Finite group with elements of given order,,"A few weeks ago, there was a queston on MSE that got edited, as soon as the question was answered well enough, according to OP. In the end, I think this question got reversed to its original question and all later questions were just forgotten. It is the last question I've seen, however, that interests me and I seem to be unable to find it, so I guess it hasn't been asked before or since. The question was: Given $a,b,c\in\mathbb{N}$, find a finite group $G$ containing elements $x$ and $y$, such that $x$ has order $a$, $y$ has order $b$ and $xy$ has order $c$. This question was supposed to be from a course on basic group theory, but I can't find an easy answer, nonetheless. The question therefore is what I'm asking as well. What I tried/noted so far: The group $G$ of course won't be abelian, in general. What I'd deem the two standard approaches didn't get me anywhere: 1) Try it via group presentations. Naïve attempt: $G=\langle x,y,z\mid x^a=1, y^b=1, z^c=1, xy=z\rangle$. This nicely satisfies the given requirements (it is made to), but it seems to fail to be finite. At least, I don't see how $x^2y=xz$ is going to be of finite order, unless $a=2$. This might be a problem, if $G$ has to be finite. 2) Some sort of twisted version of $C_a\times C_b\times C_c$, where $C_n$ is the cyclic group of order $n$ and where the product of generators of two cyclic groups is sent to the generator of the third. This again satisfies the requirements on order (where $x$ and $y$ are the generators of $C_a$ and $C_b$), but this time it fails to be well-defined. We already run into trouble for fairly small $a,b,c$: take $a=2, b=c=3$, call the identity elements $1$ and the generators of $C_a, C_b, C_c$ resp. $r,s,t$. Then $(1,s^2,1)(1,1,t^2) = (1,s,1)(r,1,1)(1,1,t)$ and if we work out the two left-hand terms first, this would be $(1,1,t^2)$, whereas it would be $(1,s^2,1)$ if the right-hand terms were multiplied first.

21,A product over the characters of a finite abelian group,A product over the characters of a finite abelian group,,"I'm comming up with the following problem in my algebraic number theory course: Problem : Let $G$ be an abelian group (the operation is denoted as multiplication) of order $fg$ . Let $a \in G$ be such that the order of $a$ is $f$ . Prove that $$ \prod_{\chi \in \widehat{G}}(1-\chi(a)T) = (1-T^f)^g, $$ where $\widehat{G}$ is the group consists of all multiplicative characters $\chi: G \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^{\times}$ . We know that $G$ is canonically isomorphic to $\widehat{G}$ . Question : How to prove this? Attempts : I'm trying to expand both sides and compare the coefficient. The right hand side is direct by binomial theorem: $(1-T^f)^g = \sum_{k=0}^{g}\binom{g}{k}(-T)^{kf}.$ On the left hand side, the coefficient of $(-T)^n$ is $$ C_n := \sum_{1 \leq i_1 < i_2 < \cdots < i_n \leq fg} \chi_{i_1}(a) \chi_{i_2}(a) \cdots \chi_{i_n}(a). $$ Comparing the coefficients, I'm trying to prove: Claim : $C_n = \binom{g}{m}$ when $n=fm$ for some $m \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ , and $C_n = 0$ when $f \nmid n$ . A special case : when $n=1$ and $a \neq 1_G$ , $C_1 = 0$ by the orthogonality of characters: $\sum_{\chi \in \widehat{G}} \chi(g) = 0$ if $g \neq 1_G$ . So to prove the claim, I also tried to imitate the proof of this orthogonality relation. Proof : Let $g \in G-\{1_G\}$ , then consider the group $G^{\prime}$ generated by $g$ . Then $|G/G^{\prime}| < n$ . Consider $H = \{\chi \in \widehat{G}: \chi(g)=1\}$ , then for any $\chi \in H$ , $\ker \chi \supset G^{\prime}$ , hence $\chi$ induces $\widetilde{\chi}: G/G^{\prime} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^{\times}$ . Moreover, different characters in $H$ induces different characters on $G/G^{\prime}$ . Hence $$ |H| \leq |(G/G^{\prime})^{\wedge}| = |G/G^{\prime}| < n = |G| = |\widehat{G}|. $$ Hence $H \subsetneq \widehat{G}$ and therefore, there exists $\psi \in \widehat{G}$ such that $\psi(g) \neq 1$ . Therefore $$ \sum_{\chi \in \widehat{G}} \chi(g) = \sum_{\chi \in \widehat{G}} \psi \chi(g) = \sum_{\chi \in \widehat{G}} \psi(g) \chi(g) = \psi(g) \sum_{\chi \in \widehat{G}} \chi(g). $$ As $\psi(g) \neq 1$ , the only chance is that $\sum_{\chi \in \widehat{G}} \chi(g)=0$ . Inspired by this, I'm trying to consider the order $f$ subgroup generated by $a$ in $G$ . But I got stuck here and not knowing how to carry on. Further question : since the notations here, especially $f$ and $g$ here is also used in the decomposition of primes in number fields (where $f$ is the inertia degree and $g$ is the number of distinct prime ideals in the decompostion of $\mathfrak{p} \subset \mathcal{O}_K$ in $\mathcal{O}_L$ .)

Or the representation of 6 5x5 matrices constructed from the direct sum of the $\mathbb Z_2$ and $\mathbb Z_3$ representations $$\left\{\pmatrix{1&0\\0&1},\pmatrix{0&1\\1&0}\right\}  $$ and $$\left\{\pmatrix{1&0&0\\0&1&0\\0&0&1},\pmatrix{0&0&1\\1&0&0\\0&1&0},\pmatrix{0&1&0\\0&0&1\\1&0&0}\right\}  $$ respectively. Neither of these representations can be written as a direct sum of other representations of $\mathbb Z_6$. In other words, as far as I can tell, these representations have only trivial subrepresentations; therefore, why should they not be considered irreducible (as per the linked question)?",,"['group-theory', 'finite-groups', 'representation-theory', 'cyclic-groups']"

31,"Is the growth rate of certain sets in $\mathbb Z$ is eventually linear?,","Is the growth rate of certain sets in  is eventually linear?,",\mathbb Z,"This question is related to Gromov's theorem in that it is about the growth rate with respect to some set of generators of $\mathbb Z$. Gromov's Theorem, along with the Bass-Guivarc'h formula, tells us that for any finite symmetric set of generators $S$ of $\mathbb Z$, if we let $$B_n = \{x \in \mathbb Z : \exists k \leq n, s_1, \ldots, s_k \in S \text{ such that }n = s_1 + \cdots + s_k\}$$ and $c(n) = \left|B_n\right|$, then $c(n) \in \Theta(n)$ since $\operatorname{rank} \mathbb Z = 1$. Computational evidence leads me to expect that there is a stronger condition on $c(n)$: I conjecture that $c(n)$ is necessarily linear for large enough $n$, that is, that there are some integers $N, a, b$ such that for all $n \geq N$, we have $c(n) = an + b$. Is this conjecture true or not? Can anyone think of a proof either way? EDIT: Computing the growth rates induced from various generating sets makes me think that in fact we have $c(n)$ linear for all $n$ such that $\{-\max S, \ldots, -1, 0, 1, \ldots, \max S\} \subseteq B_{n-1}$, or equivalently for all $n > \max d^{-1}[\{-\max S, \ldots, 0, \ldots, \max S\}]$, where $d : \mathbb Z \to \mathbb N$ is given by $d(k) = \min\{n \in \mathbb N : k \in B_n\}$; this gives a very precise bound on where the linearity must start, and in most cases this bound is actually sharp. EDIT 2: Allow me to describe some of my observations. The Mathematica code I used is provided below. $S = \pm \{4, 7\}$. Here are some plots which tell about the behavior of the $B_n$ and of $c(n)$: The upper plot, with all the dots, shows the nonnegative elements of each $B_n$ for $n = 0, 1, \ldots, 10$. ($B_n$ is always symmetric, so we do not need to show both sides.) Note that $\max S = 7$, and observe from this plot that $B_n$ contains $\{-7, -6, \ldots, 6, 7\}$ for $n \geq 5$. Now, the lower-left plot is just $c(n)$ vs. $n$, and the lower-right plot is of the differences $c(n) - c(n - 1)$. Gromov's Theorem says that $c(n) \in \Theta(n)$, and indeed the lower-left plot shows that $c(n)$ looks linear. The lower-right plot strongly suggests that $c(n)$ is exactly linear for $n > 5$, with formula determined to be $c(n) = 14n - 9$. Looking back at the various $B_n$, one may observe that the right ""edge"" of each $B_n$ is exactly the same for $n \geq 5$, which is itself close to a proof that $c(n)$ is linear past this point. $S = \pm \{1, 2, 9\}$. Here are the plots: Here again my conjectures seem to be confirmed: the lower-right plot suggests that $c(n)$ is eventually linear with slope 18, and furthermore $\max S = 9$, and we see from the upper plot that for all $n \geq 3$, $\{-9, -8, \ldots, 8, 9\} \subseteq B_n$, and from the lower-right plot again that $c(n)$ is linear on $n \geq 3$.

I found this very helpful answer that elaborates specifically how to do it. But I'm having trouble with the step 1 of that answer. As far as I understand, order of a permutation is the least common multiple of lengths of disjoint cycles. So, in symbols, I'd want to write a permutation $\sigma$ as product of disjoint cycles of lengths $r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_m$ such that $\text{lcm}(r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_m)=k$ and $\sum r_i=n$ , so from this I conclude that each cycle length $r_i$ must be a divisor of $k$ . Okay so far so good. So now, I'd want to write down $n$ as a sum of divisors of $k$ such that the $\textrm{lcm}$ of the divisors is $k$ . Now if $n$ is small, I don't think I have a problem because there are only so many divisors or cycle structures possible. But I keep messing up when $n$ is big. I keep missing some partitions of $n$ when I write them down manually and it takes a lot of time. Question: What would be a systematic way to methodically do step 1 without missing any partitions whose $\text{lcm}$ is $k$ in my exams where I have very limited time to solve a question like this?

First, let's fix some notation: $G$ will be a finite group, $R$ will denote the algebraic integers of $\mathbb{C}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ , $p$ will be a prime, $M$ will be a maximal ideal of $R$ containing $pR$ and $\mathbb{F}$ will denote the field $R/M$ , where $*:R \to \mathbb{F}$ is the canonical projection. Let $\chi\in \operatorname{Irr}(G)$ and write $\chi^*$ for the function $\chi^*(g) = \chi(g)^*$ . Then: If $\chi_1, ..., \chi_t \in \operatorname{Irr}(G)$ are all distinct and of $p$ -defect zero, then $\chi_1^*, ..., \chi_t^*$ are $\mathbb{F}$ -linearly independent; If $\chi \in \operatorname{Irr}(G)$ has $p$ -defect zero and $x \in G$ is such that $\chi(x)^* \neq 0$ , then $|G|_p = |x^G|_p$ (i.e., the greatest power of $p$ that divides the order of $G$ also divides the size of the conjugacy class of $x$ ); The number of irreducible $p$ -defect zero characters of $G$ is bounded above by the number of conjugacy classes $K$ of $G$ such that $|K|_p = |G|_p$ ; My attempt 1. Suppose $\sum_i \lambda_i \chi_i^* = 0$ . Then we may take $\mu_i \in R$ such that $\mu_i^* = \lambda_i$ . Our goal is $\mu_i \in M$ . Take $\theta = \sum_i \mu_i \chi_i$ . Our hypothesis guarantees that $\theta(G) \subset M$ . We will use 2. and its notation. We have: $$\sum_{i=1}^t \lambda_i \chi_i(1)_{p'}^* \lambda_{\chi_i}( \hat{K}) = \sum_{i=1}^t \lambda_i \chi_i(1)_{p'}^* \left( \frac{|K|\chi_i(x_K)}{\chi_i(1)} \right)^* = \sum_{i=1}^t \left( \frac{|K|\mu_i \chi_i(x_K)}{p^a} \right)^* = \left( \frac{|K|\theta(x_K)}{p^a} \right)^*$$ where $x_K$ is a representative of the conjugacy class $K$ and $p^a$ is the $p$ -part of $|G|$ . Now, either $\chi_i(x_K)^* = 0$ for all $i$ , or there exists some $i$ such that $\chi_i(x_K)^* \neq 0$ . In this last case, by 2. , the expression above will yield $0$ . All that's left is to show the same for the first case from which it will follow, from the linear independence of the $\lambda_{\chi_i}$ (which can be shown for characters of $p$ -defect zero), that $\lambda_i = 0$ for all $i$ . 2. Let $\lambda_\chi : Z(\mathbb{F}G) \to \mathbb{F}$ be the algebra homomorphism defined by $\lambda_\chi(\hat{K}) = \left( \frac{|K|\chi(x)}{\chi(1)}\right)^*$ , where $K$ is a conjugacy class of $G$ with representative $x$ (that this is well-defined and is a homomorphism was done previously in the book). We can write: $$\left( \frac{|K|\chi(x)}{\chi(1)}\right)^* = \left( \frac{|K|_p |K|_{p'}\chi(x)}{\chi(1)_p \chi(1)_{p'}}\right)^* \in \mathbb{F}$$ i.e., separating out the power of $p$ of the two integers from the rest. Now, by hypothesis, $\left( \frac{\chi(1)_{p'}}{|K|_{p'}\chi(x)}\right)^*$ is a well-defined element of $\mathbb{F}$ . Thus: $$\left( \frac{|K|_p |K|_{p'}\chi(x)}{\chi(1)_p \chi(1)_{p'}}\right)^* \cdot \left( \frac{\chi(1)_{p'}}{|K|_{p'}\chi(x)}\right)^* = \left( \frac{|K|_p}{ \chi(1)_p}\right)^* \in \mathbb{F}$$ This then proves $|K|_p \geq \chi(1)_p$ . As the latter is equal to $|G|_p$ , we get $|K|_p = |G|_p$ , as desired. 3. Here, my guess would be, using 2. , to find an element $x$ of $G$ such that $\chi(x)^* \neq 0$ for one defect zero caracter $\chi$ , but not any other. This, I have no idea how to do. It will probably involve 1. somehow, but I can't see it... Could anyone please provide some hint on how to finish item 1. and how to approach 3. ? Is my intuition for this last item correct and, if so, how to go about applying it? Thanks in advance!

My attempt is the following: Each non-trivial finite perfect group admits a non-abelian simple quotient. This holds because if the group $G$ is simple, we have done, otherwise has to admit a normal subgroup $K$ . However $G/K$ is a non-trivial perfect group and or it’s simple or admits a normal subgroup $H$ . Then $K_1:=\pi^{-1}(H)$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ containing $K$ , where $\pi \colon G\to G/K$ is the projection map. Moreover the order of $K_1$ is strictly greater than the order of $K$ . Thus in a finite number of steps we get a normal subgroup of $G$ such that the quotient has to be simple and not-abelian. The only not-abelian simple groups dividing $3024$ are $PSL(2,\mathbb{F}_7)$ and $PSL(2, \mathbb{F}_8)$ . In the second case we have that the group $G$ of order $3024$ is an extension of $PSL(2, \mathbb{F}_8)$ by a kernel $K$ of order $6=3\cdot 2$ . The kernel has to admit a $3-$ Sylow normal subgroup $S$ , that is characteristic in $K$ , and so normal in $G$ . So $G/S$ is a perfect group of order $3024/3=1008$ but there are not perfect groups of order $1008$ . The second case is quite difficult.

80,Which groups can be proven to be simple using Iwasawa criterion?,Which groups can be proven to be simple using Iwasawa criterion?,,"Recall first the following result of Iwasawa and its corollaries. In what follows, $G$ is a group acting primitively on a set $E$ , and $x_0\in E$ . We also assume that there exists a normal subgroup $A$ of $Stab_G(x_0)$ such that the various conjugates of $A$ generate $G$ . Thm.(Iwasawa) Under the previous assumptions, for any normal subgroup $N$ of $G$ , either $N$ acts trivially on $E$ , or $G/N$ is isomorphic to a quotient of $A$ . Corollary 1. If $G=[G,G]$ and $A$ is solvable, then all proper normal subgroups act trivially on $E$ , or $G$ is simple. Corollary 2. If $G=[G,G]$ and $A$ is solvable, and if $H$ denotes the kernel of the action of $G$ on $E$ , then $G/H$ is simple. Corollary $2$ is a powerful criterion to show that a group $G$ is simple, but the only application to simplicity I know is the case of $PSL(V)$ , where $V$ is a finite dimensional $K$ -vector space of dimension $n$ ( $K$ is any field) is simple (except for $n=2$ and $\vert K\vert\leq 3$ ) using Corollary 2. After giving it a bit of thinking, I convinced myself that the simplicity of the alternating group $A_n$ for $n\geq 6$ may be proven using  Corollary 2  by letting $A_n$ acts on the set of transpositions, even if I didn't find any reference using this approach. And that's it...Of course, I'm not a group theorist, so it's more likely that I don't know other classical applications of Iwasawa criterion, and I really would like to learn them. Hence the following: Question. Which other group may be proven to be simple using the results above ? I'm not assuming $G$ to be finite. For example, can we prove that $SO_{2n+1}(\mathbb{R})$ and $PSO_{2n}(\mathbb{R})$ are simple using Corollary 2 (or 1, or the general thm) ? The only proof I know for $SO$ reduces to the case $n=3$ (like simplicity of $A_n$ can be reduced to the simplicity of $A_5$ ) Same question for $PSp_{2n}(K)$ , where $K$ is an arbitrary field (except for the few exceptional cases). I suspect we could use symplectic transvections, and we can make this group to act on lines, but i didn't check. Once again, the only proof i know reduces to the case of $PSp_2(K)$ .

This is what I understand: Suppose we have two (countable) abelian groups $G,H$ . The second cohomology group $H^2(G,H)$ is defined as the group of all functions (cocycles) $c:G\times G\rightarrow H$ with the property that for all $g_1,g_2,g_3\in G$ $$c(g_1+g_2,g_3)+c(g_1,g_2) = c(g_2,g_1+g_3)+c(g_1,g_3)$$ Modulo functions (coboundaries) of the form $c(g,h) = f(g+h)-f(g)-f(h)$ for any $f:G\rightarrow H$ . Now any element $c\in H^2(G,H)$ defines a group extension $G\times_c H$ which is defined as the cartesian product of $G$ and $H$ with the multiplication $$(g,h)+ (g',h') = (g+g',c(g,g')+h+h')$$ If $c$ is a coboundary then one can prove easily that $G\times_c H$ is isomorphic to $G\times H$ (the usual product) with the isomorphism $(g,h)\mapsto (g,f(g)+h)$ . Note moreover, that the extension is abelian if $c(g_1,g_2) = c(g_2,g_1)$ (in fact, if there exists a co-boundary $d$ such that $c+d$ satisfies the above). I have the following questions I showed that if $c$ is a coboundary then $G\times_c H\cong G\times H$ .

This means that any abelian extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ splits.

We will show that there exists no set of moves $S$ that can solve the cube from any given starting position. We will argue by contradiction.

Now notice that for any cyclic group we have that the generator $c$ satisfies $$xy=c^a c^b= c^{a+b}=c^{b+a}=c^b c^a=yx$$ because addition in $\mathbb{Z}$ is commutative, it is a ring after all. This means that if the group is cyclic it must also be Abelian, which it clearly isn't, we use $r^2 g^2 r^2 $ versus $r^2 r^2 g^2 $ as a counterexample.

The analogue for Lie groups is that if a closed subgroup $Z$ is central then $G/Z$ cannot be of dimension $1$, so $\Bbb R$ or $\Bbb R/\Bbb Z$. Proof .

I think that $\operatorname{GL}(2, \mathbb{R}) = \operatorname{SL}(2, \mathbb{R}) \times \mathbb{R}^*$, so maybe there is an easy way to extend the representation theory of $\operatorname{SL}(2, \mathbb{R})$ to $\operatorname{GL}(2, \mathbb{R})$? I did find a paper by D. A. Vogan, ""The unitary dual of GL(n) over an archimedean field."", but (without having read the paper) it seems a bit abstract and does not treat the Plancherel formula.

96,Differential in Lie groups,Differential in Lie groups,,"I am trying to make sense of the Lie group machinery and relate it to the calculus. Suppose that $\psi(t)=\phi(s)\phi(t), s, t \in I$. Where $\phi(t)$ is a one-parameter subgroup of the Lie group $G$ and $I$ is an open interval containing $0$. So we have $\phi: \mathbb R \to G$ (a smooth homomorphism). Now using simple calculus we can find the differential of $\psi(t)$, treating it as a matrix, here each element is a function of $t$. Using the above, and for a fixed $s$, we can say as usual in the calculus $d\psi(t)=\phi(s)d\phi(t)$. But if instead of calculus we use the Lie group definitions I cannot easily make sense of the differential. Based on the definition if $ \psi(t): \mathbb R \to G, t \in \mathbb R ,\psi(t) \in G$ (assuming the group structure of the manifold) then $d\psi(t)$ is $d\psi(t): T_t\mathbb R \to T_{\psi(t)}G$ here, by definition we have $d\psi(t)(v)(g)=v(g \circ \psi) \in T_{\psi(t)}G, v\in T_t\mathbb R, g\in \mathcal F(G) $ Here $\mathcal F$ is the set of all smooth real-valued function on $G$. So $g: G \to \mathbb R$ Now my question is that how we can use the above definition of differential in Lie groups to say that $d\psi(t)=\phi(s)d\phi(t)$. or more explicitly, $d\psi(t)(v)(g)=\phi(s)d\phi(v)(g)$","I am trying to make sense of the Lie group machinery and relate it to the calculus.

However, even with some searching I have not been able to find a satisfactory summary of the meaning of this notation.

However, I have seen things like $4 \times 4 \times 4$ and $3^3.\mathrm{SL}_3(3)$.  What do numbers by themselves, possibly with powers, represent - the cyclic groups of those orders, perhaps?
