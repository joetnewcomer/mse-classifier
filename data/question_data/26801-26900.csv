6,A kind of generalized eigenvalue problem,A kind of generalized eigenvalue problem,,"Let $A$ , $B$ and $C$ denote three complex $2 \times 2$ matrices. Find necessary and sufficient conditions on $A$ , $B$ and $C$ for the existence of a nonzero $v \in \mathbb{C}^2$ such that $Av$ , $Bv$ and $Cv$ are all nonzero, and $Av$ , $Bv$ and $Cv$ are all multiples of each other. Motivation: I was playing around with a problem and was led to formulate the problem above. Well, actually, I am trying to prove a statement by contradiction. I assumed the statement was false, and then was able to show that it would imply the existence of a $v$ such as above for some specific $A$ , $B$ and $C$ . This led me to ask the question above, which is a kind of generalized eigenvalue problem, and can be formulated independently. Edit: I am thinking that the problem can be reformulated as to whether or not some rational cubic curve in $\mathbb{P}^3_\mathbb{C}$ intersects non-trivially the ""standard"" twisted cubic. Indeed, consider the map $\gamma$ from $\mathbb{C}^2$ to $\operatorname{Sym}^3(\mathbb{C}^2)$ which is defined by $$ \gamma(v) = Av \odot Bv \odot Cv. $$ This induces a cubic rational map $\tilde{\gamma}$ from $\mathbb{P}^1_\mathbb{C}$ to $\mathbb{P}^3_\mathbb{C}$ . I think that the image of this map can be written as an intersection of quadrics in $\mathbb{P}^3_\mathbb{C}$ , but I am not entirely sure. On the other hand, the twisted cubic is (up to some binomial coefficients) induced by the map $$ v \mapsto v \odot v \odot v.$$ And the image of the twisted cubic in $\mathbb{P}^3_\mathbb{C}$ is known to be the vanishing locus of an ideal which is generated by $4$ quadrics (it is not a complete intersection). So the problem is equivalent to whether or not the image of $\tilde{\gamma}$ intersects non-trivially the image of the twisted cubic. So I think it amounts to whether or not the common vanishing locus of finitely many quadrics in $\mathbb{P}^3_\mathbb{C}$ is non-empty.

7,Can you explain how to project this vector onto the complex plane to someone who hasn't learned Differential Geometry or Topology?,Can you explain how to project this vector onto the complex plane to someone who hasn't learned Differential Geometry or Topology?,,"Background I am trying to understand the paper ""On $C^2$ -smooth Surfaces of Constant Width"" by Brendan Guilfoyle and Wilhelm Klingenberg . However, despite my efforts to decipher the paper, I can't follow everything it is describing. This paper is written around complex differential geometry and topology, and appears either to play fast and loose with notation or to rely on conventions I haven't encountered before. I have no prior experience with differential geometry or topology in general, and the (seemingly) flexible use of notation makes it difficult to follow without intimate familiarity with the conventions of the fields in question. I have been unable to find other resources on the same topic that are easier to parse, or lessons on how to understand the concepts in the paper that aren't either behind a paywall or also way over my head. What I Understand So Far In Section 2.1: The Space of Oriented Lines , the authors say Let $𝕃$ be the set of oriented lines, or rays, in $𝔼^3$ . Such a line $γ$ is uniquely determined by its unit direction vector $\vec{U}$ and the vector $\vec{V}$ joining the origin to the point on the line that lies closest to the origin. That is, $$ γ = \{ \vec{V} + r \; \vec{U} ∈ 𝔼^3 \; | \; r ∈ ℝ \} $$ where r is an affine parameter along the line. By parallel translation, we move $\vec{U}$ to the origin and $\vec{V}$ to the head of $\vec{U}$ . Thus, we obtain a vector that is tangent to the unit 2-dimensional sphere in $𝔼^3$ . The mapping is one-to-one and so it identifies the space of oriented lines with the tangent bundle of the 2-sphere $TS^2$ (see Figure 1). $$ 𝕃 = \{ (\vec{U}, \vec{V}) ∈ 𝔼^3 × 𝔼^3 \; | \quad |\vec{U}| = 1 \quad \vec{U} ⋅ \vec{V} = 0\} $$ $$ \text{Fɪɢᴜʀᴇ 1.} $$ So far, so good. This all makes sense. In Section 2.2: Coordinates on 𝕃 , the authors introduce $ξ$ as ""the local complex coordinate on the unit 2-sphere in $𝔼^3$ obtained by stereographic projection from the south pole"" in terms of standard spherical polar angles $(θ, φ)$ with the definition $ξ = \tan\left(\frac{θ}{2}\right) e^{i φ}$ . That all checks out. The next thing they say is We convert from coordinates $(ξ, \bar{ξ})$ back to $(θ, φ)$ using $$ \cos(θ) = \frac{1 - ξ \bar{ξ}}{1 + ξ \bar{ξ}},\quad \sin(θ) = \frac{2 \sqrt{ξ \bar{ξ}}}{1 + ξ \bar{ξ}},\quad \cos(φ) = \frac{ξ + \bar{ξ}}{2 \sqrt{ξ \bar{ξ}}},\quad \sin(φ) = \frac{ξ - \bar{ξ}}{2 i \sqrt{ξ \bar{ξ}}} $$ I know the conversion from unit-spherical coordinates $(θ, φ)$ to Cartesian coordinates is $(\sin(θ) \cos(φ), \sin(θ) \sin(φ), \cos(θ))$ , and these equations all check out. Where I Get Confused Continuing farther into Section 2.2 is where I run into trouble, as the authors add another complex variable $η$ without defining it in a way I understand: This can be extended to complex coordinates $(ξ, η)$ on 𝕃 minus the tangent space over the south pole, as follows. First note that a tangent vector $\vec{X}$ to the 2-sphere can always be expressed as a linear combination of the tangent vectors generated by $θ$ and $φ$ : $$ \vec{X} = X^θ \frac{∂}{∂ θ} + X^φ \frac{∂}{∂ φ}. $$ In our complex formalism, we have the natural complex tangent vector $$ \frac{∂}{∂ ξ} = \cos\left(\frac{θ}{2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{∂}{∂ θ} - \frac{i}{2 \cos\left(\frac{θ}{2}\right) \sin\left(\frac{θ}{2}\right)} \frac{∂}{∂ φ}\right) e^{-i φ}, $$ and any real tangent vector can be written as $$ \vec{X} = η \frac{∂}{∂ ξ} + \bar{η} \frac{∂}{∂ \bar{ξ}}. $$ for a complex number $η$ . We identify the real tangent vector $\vec{X}$ on the 2-sphere (and hence the ray in $𝔼^3$ ) with the two complex numbers $(ξ, η)$ . Loosely speaking, $ξ$ determines the direction of the ray, and $η$ determines its perpendicular distance vector to the origin — complex representations of the vectors $\vec{U}$ and $\vec{V}$ . I get that $\vec{U}$ is being projected from $𝔼^3$ into the complex plane as $ξ$ , since $\vec{U}$ is a unit vector with its base on the origin and its head on the unit sphere at position $(θ, φ)$ . However, I don't understand how $\vec{V}$ gets converted to $η$ . $\vec{V}$ is not necessarily of unit length, so it can't be as simple as $\vec{U}$ 's projection. There seem to be a number of different ways to project $\vec{V}$ into the complex plane, and I'm not sure which is correct. Can you explain the conversion between $\vec{V}$ and $η$ to someone whose formal math education hasn't gone past Calc 1? Specifically, based on the next sections of the paper, I need to be able to convert from coordinates $(ξ, η)$ to the vectors $\vec{U}$ and $\vec{V}$ .

We have an oracle that takes as input a number $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and returns $n$ different $x$ values sampled from the Gaussian and $n$ $y$ values corresponding to the $x$ values, but they are unpaired (meaning that if we label the $x, y$ values as $$\begin{array}{c} x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}\\ y_{1},\ldots,y_{n} \end{array}$$ there is some permutation $\pi$ such that for all $i$ we have $y_{i}=Ax_{\pi\left(i\right)}$ . The Question What is the minimal number $n$ that we need to give to the oracle, in order to determine $A$ (prove your answer). If it isn't possible with any finite (or even infinite) number of samples - prove it. Are the cases where $A$ is invertible different from the case where it isn't? My Attempt My initial gut feeling was that it's impossible, but then I had the following Idea. Clearly, if we had two paired samples $\left(x_{1},y_{1}\right),\left(x_{2},y_{2}\right)$ we could determine $A$ easily. But since they are unpaired, what we could maybe do is choose $n=3$ and go over all different permutations, using the first two pairs to determine $A$ and check if it fits the 3rd pair. However, I am not sure if this is correct, as perhaps I could find two permutations yielding different $A$ 's.

24,Help proving that signed volume of n-parallelepiped is multilinear,Help proving that signed volume of n-parallelepiped is multilinear,,"Overview I am trying to build some intuition about the volumes of parallelepipeds and determinants. I would like to define the determinant as the unique function of $N$ vectors in $\mathbb{R}^N$ which is multilinear, anti-symmetric, and normalized and then show that the signed volume of the $N$ -parallelepiped satisfies these conditions without using any facts about determinants . The challenging one here for me is multi-linearity. Furthermore, I would like the signed volume to be defined in terms of Lebesgue integrals. Problem Setup Let $v_1, \ldots, v_N \in \mathbb{R}^N$ . A parallelepiped $P = P(v_1, \ldots, v_N) \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ is the set $$ P = P(v_1, \ldots, v_N) = \left\{\sum_{i=1}^N t_i v_i \mid 0 \le t_i \le 1 \text{ for $i$ from 1 to $N$} \right\} $$ My goal is to define a function $\text{svol}(P) = \text{svol}(v_1,\ldots, v_N)$ which is the signed volume of the parallelepiped $P$ . The volume $\text{vol}$ of the parallelepiped is defined as follows. Let $1_P$ be the indicator function on the set $P$ . $$ \text{vol}(P) = \text{vol}(v_1, \ldots, v_N) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^N} 1_P dV $$ Where the integral is the Lebesgue integral. We should have $$ |\text{svol}(P)| = \text{vol}(P) $$ We must additionally define, or provide an algorithm, to set the sign of $\text{svol}(P)$ . It is apparently the case, once everything above has been set up correctly, that for $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ and $w \in \mathbb{R}^N$ \begin{equation} \tag{*} \text{svol}(av_1 + bw, v_2, \ldots v_N) = a\cdot \text{svol}(v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_N) + b\cdot \text{svol}(w, v_2, \ldots v_N) \end{equation} The Direct Questions My questions are How should $\text{svol}(v_1,\ldots, v_N)$ be defined such that (1) it is defined in terms of an integral over $\mathbb{R}^N$ and (2) we are able to prove $(*)$ . Given the definition that answers the previous question, how do we prove $(*)$ ? An Illustrative Image The answer to this question includes a beautiful illustration the depicts exactly what I am trying to prove. It is intuitively clear to me from this diagram and Cavalieri's principle that $(*)$ should hold. But of course, for me, the illustration does not constitute a fully rigorous proof following the conditions I laid out above. An Almost Solution The closest I have come to a satisfactory proof is as follows. It is possible to define the volume of the $n$ -parallelepiped inductively. We say the volume of the 1-parallelepiped $\overline{\text{vol}}(P) = ||v||$ . The volume of the $n$ -parallelepiped is then defined by $\overline{\text{vol}}_N(v_1, \ldots, v_N) = \overline{\text{vol}}_{N-1}(v_1, \ldots, v_{N-1}) \cdot ||v_{N, \perp}||$ where $v_{N, \perp}$ is the component of $v_N$ which is orthogonal to the span of $\{v_1, \ldots, v_{N-1}\}$ . This component may be called the $N^{\text{th}}$ altitude of the parallelepiped. Under this definition the proof follows because, from $(*)$ , $||v_{1, \perp}|| + ||w_{\perp}|| = ||(v_1 + w)_{\perp}||$ . This proof is essentially a conversion of the image above into a more rigorous definition and proof. I think the quick proof I've given here lacks something defining the sign of $\overline{\text{vol}_N}$ . The problems with this proof are the lack of control of the sign of the volume and that the definition of $\overline{\text{vol}}_N$ is not based on an integral. One appropriate answer to the question I am asking in this thread would be a way to control the sign of $\overline{\text{vol}_N}$ and relate $\overline{\text{vol}_N}$ to the integration based definition of volume. This would essentially be an equation relating $\text{svol}$ and $\overline{\text{vol}_N}$ . Comment About Sign I realize that to define $\text{sgn}(\text{svol}(v_1,\ldots, v_N))$ that we must make some convention choice. This convention choice should be consistent with $\text{sgn}(\text{svol}(e_1,\ldots,e_N)) = +1$ where $\{e_1, \ldots, e_N\}$ is the standard basis for $\mathbb{R}^N$ . Beyond that, I'm not sure how to define the sign in a way that does not use any facts about determinants . I don't know if there's a way to determine if two sets of $N$ vectors, $\{v_1, \ldots, v_N\}$ and $\{w_1, \ldots, w_N\}$ have the same orientation other than computing the sign of the determinant. If someone has an answer here I would appreciate it. If not I would be comfortable with the following. Let $$ D(v_1, \ldots, v_N) = \sum_{\sigma \in S_N} \text{sgn}(\sigma) \prod_{i=1}^N v_{i, \sigma(i)} $$ where $S_N$ is the symmetric group of size $N$ and if $j=\sigma(i)$ then $v_{i, j}$ indicates the $j^{\text{th}}$ component of vector $v_i$ . Then let $$ \text{sgn}(\text{svol}(v_1, \ldots, v_N)) = \text{sgn}(D(v_1, \ldots, v_N)) $$ so that $$ \text{svol}(v_1, \ldots, v_N) = \text{sgn}(D(v_1, \ldots, v_N)) \cdot \text{vol}(v_1, \ldots, v_N) $$ This last section essentially serves as an answer to my first question above.

I want to know if it's possible to endow $\text{Hom}(P,V)$ with a natural inner product, but without using the (non-canonical) isomorphism between $V$ and $V^*$ and then considering something like $\langle{\phi},{\psi}\rangle = \text{tr}(\phi^{\top} \circ \psi)$ . What comes to my mind and what is more suitable to the setup I'm working on is something like this: assume that $P$ and $V$ have inner products $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle_P$ and $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle_V$ , respectively. Then, we can identify $P \otimes V$ with $\text{Hom}(P,V)$ using the map $p \otimes v \mapsto \langle \cdot, p \rangle_P v$ and we can consider the canonical inner product on $P \otimes V$ given by $\langle p \otimes v, q \otimes w \rangle_{P \otimes V} := \langle p, q \rangle_P \langle v, w \rangle_P$ .

My question: Is there some $4\times 4$ unitary matrix $M$ such that $S$ is all the solutions to the equation $f(\theta,\lambda,\phi,\delta,\alpha,\beta)=0$ ? Motivation: If I could prove this question in the negative (there are no such matrices $M$ ), then I could show that at least $3$ qubits are required for an error detection code I am developing for a quantum computer. I won't bore you with all the details (unless someone wants to know more), but my problem has simplified to the linear algebra question above. Work: So far, I have tried a lot of different ways of proving the above without much success. For any set matrix $M$ , I can always find solutions that are not in $S$ . However, it does seem like almost all the degrees of freedom are required because there are some $M$ where the solution seems to lie on a line in $\mathbb{R}^6$ space (basically it depends on the difference between $\alpha$ and $\beta$ ). That is, it does not form a family of solutions on a plane/hyper-plane in the space.

Firstly, I will quote the definition of the rref from the same book where the proposition was given: A matrix is in reduced row echelon form, normally abbreviated to rref,   if it satisfies all the following conditions: If there are any rows containing only zero entries then they are located in the bottom part of the matrix. If a row contains non-zero entries then the first non-zero entry is a 1. This 1 is called a leading 1.

Then $\bf R$ must have a leading $1$ (call it $x_{i,j}$ ) which is located in ith row and jth column and $j > i$ .

In this case, if $x_{i,j}$ = 1, then $i = j$ , because we've shown that if $j > i$ then $\bf R$ will have row of zeros. And by definition of the identity matrix, we can conclude that $\bf R = I$ $\Box$ . Although I have a lot of doubts, but I will ask: is it correct?

54,Can we obtain an explicit and efficient analytic interpolation of tetration by this method?,Can we obtain an explicit and efficient analytic interpolation of tetration by this method?,,"I am curious about this. It has been a very long time since I have ever toyed with this topic but it was an old interest of mine quite some time ago - maybe 8 years (250 megaseconds) ago at least, and I never really got to a conclusion, nor do I think anyone did entirely satisfactorily, and some comments on a Youtube video I was watching inspired me to dust it off and try once more to give it another thwack. And the question is, basically, how can one construct a ""reasonable"" interpolation of the ""tetration"" operation, also called a ""power tower"", which for those who have not heard of it is defined for natural $n > 1$ and real $a > 1$ by $$^{n} a = a \uparrow \uparrow n := \underbrace{a^{a^{a^{...^a}}}}_{\mbox{$n$ copies of $a$}}$$ where the nested exponentiations on the left are evaluated in rightassociative fashion, so the deepest (""highest"") layer is done first, e.g. $$^{3} 3 = 3^{3^3} = 3^{27} = 7\ 625\ 597\ 484\ 987$$ and not left-associative, i.e. $$^{3} 3 \ne (3^3)^3 = 3^{3 \cdot 3} = 3^9 = 19\ 683$$ What the ""interpolation"" part means is basically, given that this definition clearly only works for values of the second argument, $n$ (called as such by analogy with exponentiation even though it is written first in the ""left-superscript"" notation just introduced), usually called the ""height"" of the tetration or power tower for obvious reasons, that are natural numbers at least 1, since we have to have a whole number of ""copies of $a$ "" - half a copy, say, wouldn't make much sense, as while you can literally write a half-written "" $a$ "", that is formally nonsense and has no mathematical meaning, although it may have other forms of meaning from other angles of human understanding and analysis, e.g. perhaps as a form of artsey commentary. Mathematical meaning is, though, of course, what we're interested in. We can, of course, naturally extend this in a way similar to extending exponentiation to the integers by noting that $$^{n+1} a = a^{^n a}$$ and thus $$^{n-1} a = \log_a(^n a)$$ and if we do this we can at least extend that $^0 a = 1$ , similar to exponentiation, and $^{(-1)} a = 0$ , a rather interesting result when viewed in contrast to exponentiation given that the first negative exponentiation of a number is not a constant but instead its reciprocal. Of course, we cannot extend now to $^{(-2)} a$ , as then we get $\log_a(0)$ which is undefined (though of course if you want to stretch the maths a bit and expand the codomain to the extended reals, you can say $^{(-2)}a = -\infty$ . In any case though, $^{(-3)} a$ and further are definitely, really undefined, since no real exponential can be negative, much less negative infinity!). So this peters out. Of course, the most interesting bit - as hinted at with the ""half a copy"" business above - is trying to extend the height $n$ to real values, presumably in $(-2, \infty)$ at least. And there have been a number of methods fielded in those past epochs which attempt to do this as well as some interesting ones regarding the conditions which are required to produce a suitably ""natural"" extension, given that it is trivially obvious that one can, of course, ""interpolate"" a given sparse sequence of points in any way that one desires and, moreover, even with the identities $^{n+1} a = a^{^n a}$ , they only suffice to make it unique insofar as whole-number increments of the tower are concerned - fill any unit interval with anything you like, and the identity will extend to provide an interpolant that will satisfy it. For exponentiation, this non-uniqueness is much less of a problem because we also have the additional identity $a^{n+m} = a^n a^m$ , which lets us extend to rational values, however no such identity exists for tetration. In this regard, extension of tetration is similar to the question of extension of the factorial, which is similarly impoverished of identities, with new ones interestingly only coming about after the extension was done by Euler in the form of the gamma function, to meet a challenge originally proposed by Bernoulli to do exactly this. The gamma function, however, is still ostensibly more ""natural"" simply because a) it often crops up and b) it has some very cute integral representations, esp. the darlin' $$\Gamma(x) = \int_{0}^{1} [-\log(u)]^{n-1}\ du$$ (Though with regard to objection a), one could say this may be simply because we have not yet found such an expression, and thus places where it might be useful, could be currently written off as ""unsolvable"".) Yet clearly, that doesn't seem to have been the case for tetration, either. Moreover, in all these past discussions, many of the extension methods proposed are in fact extremely cumbersome and computationally intensive to approximate, involving elaborate constructs like Riemann mappings, infinite limits of integral equations, and so forth - all things that are, while mathematically valid, both inelegant and also not something you're going be able to program into a software pack like Mathematica and have it spit out 2500 digits of $^{1/2} 2$ in the blink of an eye. But nonetheless, one particular method out of these proposed methods seems be both fairly simple and like that it might possible be amenable to more detailed analysis, and that is the ""Carleman matrix"" operator method. This method is most succinctly expressed for the specific case $a = e$ , to construct the ""natural tetrational"" $\mathrm{tet}(x) :=\ ^x e$ with real height $x$ , so we'll just focus on that for now. But basically it is based on the following two observations. The first is that one can consider the result of the height- $n$ power tower of $e$ as the iterated exponential evaluated at $1$ , namely $$^n e = \exp^n(1)$$ or perhaps more nicely for what we're about to do, $$^{n-1} e = \exp^n(0)$$ which has some interesting gamma-function like quality about it with the offset. And the second one is the following. If we let $\exp$ be given by its power series, $$\exp(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!}$$ then we can actually represent such iterated exponentials using what is called its Carleman matrix , basically the infinite-order ""matrix"" with entries $$C[\exp]_{ij} = \frac{i^j}{j!}$$ such that if we have the infinite vector of exponential coefficients $\mathbf{a} = \left[ \frac{1}{1!}\ \frac{1}{2!}\ \frac{1}{3!}\ \cdots \right]^T$ then the vector $\mathbf{b}_n = (\mathbf{C}[\exp])^n \mathbf{a}$ is the coefficients of $\exp^n$ . In particular, if we sum the top row, we get exactly what we want: $^{n-1} e$ . Now the question is, though, how can we compute this matrix power for fractional $n$ in some explicit form? It seems one possible way to do this, and the way that I saw when this method was suggested (by Gottfried Helms, who was here a long time ago, not sure if they're still so) was to try to diagonalize the matrix, so that you can use the fact that if a matrix $\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{P}\mathbf{D}\mathbf{P}^{-1}$ for some diagonal matrix $\mathbf{D}$ (which happens to be the matrix of eigenvalues) then $\mathbf{A}^t = \mathbf{P}\mathbf{D}^t\mathbf{P}^{-1}$ where that the inner power is easy to compute as you just take exponents of the diagonal terms. And numerically this seems to work for at least finite truncations of the matrix $\mathbf{C}[\exp]$ , but analytically it may be on shaky ground, as I see with this thread here that I just saw when trying to dig into this once more: Diagonalization of an infinite matrix and moreover it's still not super efficient as we'd like - we're not computing 2500 digits of $^{1/2} e$ and I want them computed, dammit! However, it seems that in this case some of the objections raised in that thread do not perhaps apply here. In particular, it is mentioned how that an infinite matrix diagonalization is ambiguous (seems to mirror the situation with the tetration interpolation generally where there is great freedom) due to choice of suitable normed vector space over which to make sense of it, and moreover in that question it was pointed that the usual most ""natural"" space, $\ell^2$ , did not work for that questioner's particular matrix, because in particular it would ""map"" most ""vectors"" of $\ell^2$ to effectively outside of the space. However , this Carleman matrix seems better behaved - in particular, due to the fact that any vector $[\ a_0\ a_1\ a_2\ \cdots\ ]^T \in \ell^2$ by definition must have terms that converge absolutely as an infinite sum, then that owing to the factorials in the matrix when we multiply by it we should also get an (even more) convergent series, as is illustrated by considering the bounding ""vector"" $[\ 1\ 1\ 1\ \cdots\ ]^T$ as ""formally"" acted upon by $\mathbf{C}[\exp]$ . So it seems that in that regard, we are in better shape against at least the objections raised in that thread in this case than for that poster's scenario. Thus the question I have is, if we take the relevant target space as $\ell^2$ , can we find a ""natural"" infinite diagonalization and thus matrix-power for this case, and moreover express it somehow in terms of at least some sort of infinite combinatorial sums or otherwise easily-manipulated expressions for its coefficients? Moreover, another interesting and seemingly natural question provoked by this is, exactly how sensitive is the method to the choice of at least norm used to interpret the matrix power, i.e. can we have absolute freedom to interpolate $^n e$ in any way we please, and if not, then just how much do we get? I suspect ""a lot"", but there are some ""lots"" that are more than others in mathematics, even when infinities are concerned, thanks to Cantor. And can we do the inverse - i.e. if I fill in $^{n} e$ with some freely-chosen interpolant in the interval $[0, 1]$ (for the purpose of making things easy I'll assume it's continuous and moreover equals $1$ at $x = 0$ and $e$ at $x = 1$ ) - can we find a norm such that the associated Carleman matrix power will produce that interpolant? Does it have to be analytic (seems right, but keep in mind that we are summing the top row , not necessarily creating a power series valid for all or even any inputs, though again it also ""seems"" right that if not analytic, it'll diverge)? If so, what's the proof? ADD (epoch time 1545.46 Ms): In the quest for an at least summatory-formula shot at the diagonalization, I note this matrix has the interesting relations among rows and columns given by $$C[\exp]_{(i+1)j} = \sum_{k=0}^{j} \frac{1}{(j - k)!} C_{ik}$$ and $$C[\exp]_{i(j+1)} = \frac{i}{j+1} C_{ij}$$ Not sure if this helps anything, though. But at least it shows there is structure and thus we're not just dealing with effectively purely random matrices and thus in theory it might somehow be exploited in some fashion to simplify things. ADD 2 (same time): You should actually sum the second row of the matrix power to get the tetration $^n e$ , not the first to get $^{n-1} e$ . The first row always sums to 1. ADD 3 (ue+1545.47 Ms): The first row formula above allows us to derive the interesting property that if $\mathbf{C}[\exp]$ is right-multiplied by the factorial matrix $$\mathbf{D} := \begin{bmatrix} 1 & \frac{1}{1!} & \frac{1}{2!} & \frac{1}{3!} & \cdots \\ 0 & 1 & \frac{1}{1!} & \frac{1}{2!} & \cdots \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & \frac{1}{1!} & \cdots \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & \cdots \\ & & \cdots & & \end{bmatrix}$$ where $D_{kj} = \frac{1}{(j-k)!}$ (with negative-argument factorials ""naturally"" extended as $\infty$ so these $D$ terms are $0$ ), it shifts up by one row. ADD 4 (sim. time): It looks like we can move both up and down, in particular the matrix $\mathbf{D}$ with entries $D_{kj} = (-1)^{k-j} \frac{1}{(k-j)!}$ will shift down, while the other matrix above, perhaps better called $\mathbf{U}$ instead will shift up. Shifting left and right is possible as well but via the Hadamard product and not the ordinary product, as the second set of relations between columns indicates. In particular, the Hadamard product with the matrix $\mathbf{L}$ with entries $L_{ij} = \frac{i}{j+1}$ will shift left, and the matrix $\mathbf{R}$ with entries $R_{ij} = \frac{j}{i}$ will shift right. Thus we have some interesting system for ""moving"" the matrix about like some kind of tableau or grid - not sure what these symmetry properties do though for easing the analytic solution/explicit formula of the matrixpower as a summation.","I am curious about this. It has been a very long time since I have ever toyed with this topic but it was an old interest of mine quite some time ago - maybe 8 years (250 megaseconds) ago at least, and I never really got to a conclusion, nor do I think anyone did entirely satisfactorily, and some comments on a Youtube video I was watching inspired me to dust it off and try once more to give it another thwack. And the question is, basically, how can one construct a ""reasonable"" interpolation of the ""tetration"" operation, also called a ""power tower"", which for those who have not heard of it is defined for natural and real by where the nested exponentiations on the left are evaluated in rightassociative fashion, so the deepest (""highest"") layer is done first, e.g. and not left-associative, i.e. What the ""interpolation"" part means is basically, given that this definition clearly only works for values of the second argument, (called as such by analogy with exponentiation even though it is written first in the ""left-superscript"" notation just introduced), usually called the ""height"" of the tetration or power tower for obvious reasons, that are natural numbers at least 1, since we have to have a whole number of ""copies of "" - half a copy, say, wouldn't make much sense, as while you can literally write a half-written "" "", that is formally nonsense and has no mathematical meaning, although it may have other forms of meaning from other angles of human understanding and analysis, e.g. perhaps as a form of artsey commentary. Mathematical meaning is, though, of course, what we're interested in. We can, of course, naturally extend this in a way similar to extending exponentiation to the integers by noting that and thus and if we do this we can at least extend that , similar to exponentiation, and , a rather interesting result when viewed in contrast to exponentiation given that the first negative exponentiation of a number is not a constant but instead its reciprocal. Of course, we cannot extend now to , as then we get which is undefined (though of course if you want to stretch the maths a bit and expand the codomain to the extended reals, you can say . In any case though, and further are definitely, really undefined, since no real exponential can be negative, much less negative infinity!). So this peters out. Of course, the most interesting bit - as hinted at with the ""half a copy"" business above - is trying to extend the height to real values, presumably in at least. And there have been a number of methods fielded in those past epochs which attempt to do this as well as some interesting ones regarding the conditions which are required to produce a suitably ""natural"" extension, given that it is trivially obvious that one can, of course, ""interpolate"" a given sparse sequence of points in any way that one desires and, moreover, even with the identities , they only suffice to make it unique insofar as whole-number increments of the tower are concerned - fill any unit interval with anything you like, and the identity will extend to provide an interpolant that will satisfy it. For exponentiation, this non-uniqueness is much less of a problem because we also have the additional identity , which lets us extend to rational values, however no such identity exists for tetration. In this regard, extension of tetration is similar to the question of extension of the factorial, which is similarly impoverished of identities, with new ones interestingly only coming about after the extension was done by Euler in the form of the gamma function, to meet a challenge originally proposed by Bernoulli to do exactly this. The gamma function, however, is still ostensibly more ""natural"" simply because a) it often crops up and b) it has some very cute integral representations, esp. the darlin' (Though with regard to objection a), one could say this may be simply because we have not yet found such an expression, and thus places where it might be useful, could be currently written off as ""unsolvable"".) Yet clearly, that doesn't seem to have been the case for tetration, either. Moreover, in all these past discussions, many of the extension methods proposed are in fact extremely cumbersome and computationally intensive to approximate, involving elaborate constructs like Riemann mappings, infinite limits of integral equations, and so forth - all things that are, while mathematically valid, both inelegant and also not something you're going be able to program into a software pack like Mathematica and have it spit out 2500 digits of in the blink of an eye. But nonetheless, one particular method out of these proposed methods seems be both fairly simple and like that it might possible be amenable to more detailed analysis, and that is the ""Carleman matrix"" operator method. This method is most succinctly expressed for the specific case , to construct the ""natural tetrational"" with real height , so we'll just focus on that for now. But basically it is based on the following two observations. The first is that one can consider the result of the height- power tower of as the iterated exponential evaluated at , namely or perhaps more nicely for what we're about to do, which has some interesting gamma-function like quality about it with the offset. And the second one is the following. If we let be given by its power series, then we can actually represent such iterated exponentials using what is called its Carleman matrix , basically the infinite-order ""matrix"" with entries such that if we have the infinite vector of exponential coefficients then the vector is the coefficients of . In particular, if we sum the top row, we get exactly what we want: . Now the question is, though, how can we compute this matrix power for fractional in some explicit form? It seems one possible way to do this, and the way that I saw when this method was suggested (by Gottfried Helms, who was here a long time ago, not sure if they're still so) was to try to diagonalize the matrix, so that you can use the fact that if a matrix for some diagonal matrix (which happens to be the matrix of eigenvalues) then where that the inner power is easy to compute as you just take exponents of the diagonal terms. And numerically this seems to work for at least finite truncations of the matrix , but analytically it may be on shaky ground, as I see with this thread here that I just saw when trying to dig into this once more: Diagonalization of an infinite matrix and moreover it's still not super efficient as we'd like - we're not computing 2500 digits of and I want them computed, dammit! However, it seems that in this case some of the objections raised in that thread do not perhaps apply here. In particular, it is mentioned how that an infinite matrix diagonalization is ambiguous (seems to mirror the situation with the tetration interpolation generally where there is great freedom) due to choice of suitable normed vector space over which to make sense of it, and moreover in that question it was pointed that the usual most ""natural"" space, , did not work for that questioner's particular matrix, because in particular it would ""map"" most ""vectors"" of to effectively outside of the space. However , this Carleman matrix seems better behaved - in particular, due to the fact that any vector by definition must have terms that converge absolutely as an infinite sum, then that owing to the factorials in the matrix when we multiply by it we should also get an (even more) convergent series, as is illustrated by considering the bounding ""vector"" as ""formally"" acted upon by . So it seems that in that regard, we are in better shape against at least the objections raised in that thread in this case than for that poster's scenario. Thus the question I have is, if we take the relevant target space as , can we find a ""natural"" infinite diagonalization and thus matrix-power for this case, and moreover express it somehow in terms of at least some sort of infinite combinatorial sums or otherwise easily-manipulated expressions for its coefficients? Moreover, another interesting and seemingly natural question provoked by this is, exactly how sensitive is the method to the choice of at least norm used to interpret the matrix power, i.e. can we have absolute freedom to interpolate in any way we please, and if not, then just how much do we get? I suspect ""a lot"", but there are some ""lots"" that are more than others in mathematics, even when infinities are concerned, thanks to Cantor. And can we do the inverse - i.e. if I fill in with some freely-chosen interpolant in the interval (for the purpose of making things easy I'll assume it's continuous and moreover equals at and at ) - can we find a norm such that the associated Carleman matrix power will produce that interpolant? Does it have to be analytic (seems right, but keep in mind that we are summing the top row , not necessarily creating a power series valid for all or even any inputs, though again it also ""seems"" right that if not analytic, it'll diverge)? If so, what's the proof?

The problem comes from expanding the Kähler potential of the Grassmannian manifold in the vicinity of a certain point. Consider two matrices, $\{A^i_j\}_{N\times N}$ and $\{\tilde{A}^\alpha_\beta\}_{M\times M}$, defined as: \begin{alignat}{9} \begin{alignedat}{9} A^i_j = \delta^i_j + \phi^i_\alpha\bar{\phi}^\alpha_j\\ \tilde{A}^\alpha_\beta = \delta^\alpha_\beta + \bar{\phi}^\alpha_i\phi^i_\beta \end{alignedat}\quad,\qquad \begin{alignedat}{9} i,j&=1\ldots N\\ \alpha,\beta&=1\ldots M \end{alignedat} \end{alignat} Here bar denotes Hermitean conjugation. It's straightforward to show that $\operatorname{Tr{}} \ln(A) = \tilde{\operatorname{Tr{}}} \ln(\tilde{A}) \equiv K$, where the tilde over the trace reminds that the trace is taken over the greek indices.

It's straightforward to show that $\operatorname{Tr{}} \ln(A) = \tilde{\operatorname{Tr{}}} \ln(\tilde{A}) \equiv K$, where the tilde over the trace reminds that the trace is taken over the greek indices.

Given a vector $v\in V$, express it as as $v=\sum a_i v_i$.  Let $f_A(v)=\prod a_i$.  This satisfies the nice property that $f_A(Av)=\det(A)f_A(v)$. I came across this construction when trying to find invariants for generalized Fibonacci sequences.  In particular, define $G_0=a, G_1=b, G_{n+1}=G_n+G_{n-1}$ for $n>1$.  Applying this construction to the equation $$ \pmatrix{1 & 1\\ 1 & 0}^n\pmatrix{b \\ a} =\pmatrix{G_n \\ G_{n-1}}$$ yields that $G_{n}G_{n+2}-G_{n+1}^2=(-1)^n(G_0G_2-G_1^2)=(-1)^n(a(a+b)-b^2)$.  In particular, $|G_{n}G_{n+2}-G_{n+1}^2|$ is independent of $n$, so if one wanted to determine whether $(c,d)=(G_n,G_{n+1})$ for some $n$, then a necessary condition is that $c(c+d)-d^2=(-1)^n(a(a+b)-b^2)$. This identity is similar to but more general than the classical identity $F_{n-1}F_{n+1}-F_n^2=(-1)^n$ My question: Has this construction been studied before? Is there a cleaner approach to it?  Does it generalize?  Are there other, better ways to generate functions that satisfy $f(Av)=\det(A)f(v)$? Update: The construction can be rephrased (up to a constant) as $\det(M(v))$ where $M(v)$ is the matrix whose columns are the $A$-eignevectors which sum to $v$.  The property $f(Av)=\det(A)f(v)$ comes from the property that $M(Av)=AM(v)$.  Therefore, this question could be answered by a classification of the maps $V\to \hom(V,V)$ which commute with $A$.

Applying this construction to the equation $$ \pmatrix{1 & 1\\ 1 & 0}^n\pmatrix{b \\ a} =\pmatrix{G_n \\ G_{n-1}}$$ yields that $G_{n}G_{n+2}-G_{n+1}^2=(-1)^n(G_0G_2-G_1^2)=(-1)^n(a(a+b)-b^2)$.  In particular, $|G_{n}G_{n+2}-G_{n+1}^2|$ is independent of $n$, so if one wanted to determine whether $(c,d)=(G_n,G_{n+1})$ for some $n$, then a necessary condition is that $c(c+d)-d^2=(-1)^n(a(a+b)-b^2)$. This identity is similar to but more general than the classical identity $F_{n-1}F_{n+1}-F_n^2=(-1)^n$ My question: Has this construction been studied before? Is there a cleaner approach to it?  Does it generalize?  Are there other, better ways to generate functions that satisfy $f(Av)=\det(A)f(v)$? Update: The construction can be rephrased (up to a constant) as $\det(M(v))$ where $M(v)$ is the matrix whose columns are the $A$-eignevectors which sum to $v$.  The property $f(Av)=\det(A)f(v)$ comes from the property that $M(Av)=AM(v)$.  Therefore, this question could be answered by a classification of the maps $V\to \hom(V,V)$ which commute with $A$. I feel like this kind of tensor construction has a better chance of having been studied.",,"['linear-algebra', 'reference-request', 'tensor-products']"
97,Bound on $x^TAx$ for SPD matrix $A$ in terms of its main diagonal,Bound on  for SPD matrix  in terms of its main diagonal,x^TAx A,"Let $A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ be a symmetric positive definite matrix and $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$ some vector. I want to find a bound of the form $$x^T Ax \leq c \sum_{i=1}^n a_{ii} x_i^2$$ with a constant $c>0$ . If $\lambda_\text{min}$ and $\lambda_\text{max}$ denote the smallest and largest eigenvalue of $A$ (both are positive due to spd assumption), then one bound that holds is $$x^T Ax \leq \frac{\lambda_\text{max}}{\lambda_\text{min}} \sum_{i=1}^n a_{ii} x_i^2.$$ Proof: $$x^TAx \leq \lambda_\text{max} \Vert x\Vert^2 = \frac{\lambda_\text{max}}{\lambda_\text{min}} \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_\text{min} x_i^2 \leq \frac{\lambda_\text{max}}{\lambda_\text{min}} \sum_{i=1}^n a_{ii} x_i^2$$ where we used that $a_{ii} \geq \lambda_\text{min}$ for all $i$ .

99,"Finding $n\dim B$ linearly independent invertible matrices in $M(n,B)$?",Finding  linearly independent invertible matrices in ?,"n\dim B M(n,B)","I'm trying to solve the following exercise: If $A$ is a finite-dimensional $k$-algebra, then a minimal representation of $A$ is a representation of minimal $k$-dimension. Show that if $B$ is a finite-dimensional division algebra over $k$ and $A=M(n,B)$, then the action of $A$ on $B^n$ is a minimal representation. To show this, we need to show that if we have any representation $A\to\text{End}(V)$ for a $k$-space $V$, then $\dim V\ge n\dim B$. I will write this map as $E\mapsto\varphi_E$ for $E\in A$. Now, if I suppose that $A$ has $nm$ linearly independent invertible matrices $E_1,\dots,E_{nm}$, where $m=\dim B$ then I will be done. By taking some nonzero $v\in V$, I let $v_i=\varphi_{E_i}(v)$ then this is nonzero since $\varphi_{E_i}$ is invertible (since $E_i$ is), and I can show that $\{v_1,\dots,v_{nm}\}$ is linearly independent using the linear independence of $E_1,\dots,E_{nm}$ in $A$. So my problem just lies now in finding $nm$ linearly independent, invertible elements of $A$ (the latter of which is the same as having $\det E\neq0$ since $B$ is a division algebra).
