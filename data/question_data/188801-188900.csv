Since $\exists x_1, x_2 \in R : x_1 \neq x_2 \land f(x_1) \neq f(x_2)$ (namely, $[-2, 2]$), $f(x)$ is not 1-1 on the domain $R$. Similarly, $R$ is not onto (there is no value mapping to some $a < 0 \in R$. My question is, did I prove it adequately in the sense that I proved it by contradiction rather than using a constructive proof? I'd rather use a constructive proof and show it generally. $(b) f(x) = x^3$ on $N, Z, R$ With similar reasoning, it can be shown that $f(x)$ is 1-1 on $N, Z, R$ and onto on $R$.",,"['elementary-set-theory', 'functions']"
