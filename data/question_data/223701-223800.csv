2,Tangent bundle for smooth algebraic variety,Tangent bundle for smooth algebraic variety,,"I was discussing with some friend about how to define the tangent bundle for a smooth variety since this is very natural in the manifold setting and we couldn't find references discussing in detail. For example, if $X\subset\mathbb{A}^n$ is an affine algebraic variety we can define the tangent bundle $TX\subset\mathbb{A}^{2n}$ , where first $n$ coordinates respect de equations for $X$ and the other the equations for tangent spaces: $\sum_{i=1}^n{\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}}(x)y_i=0$ . These imply that $TX$ is an algebraic variety, but my problem is: is this a vector bundle? The problem is that I don't see how it will be locally trivial.

5,Understanding Chinese Remainder Theorem using Schemes,Understanding Chinese Remainder Theorem using Schemes,,"I was looking at Ravi Vakil's Algebraic Geometry notes and in 4.4.11, he states that the Chinese Remainder Theorem is a geometric fact that can be understood through schemes. He uses the example of $\mathbb{Z}/(60)$ to illustrate the sketch of the idea. I am trying to understand how to prove the statement in general using his sketch and ran into some trouble. First I'll explain his general sketch and what I have understood in the proof so far : The Chinese Remainder Theorem says that knowing an integer modulo 60 is the same as knowing an integer modulo $2$ , $3$ , and $5$ . What is Spec $\mathbb{Z}/(60)$ ? It is those prime ideals containing $(60)$ , i.e., $(2)$ , $(3)$ , and $(5)$ . This part is fairly simple. In the general version, this translates as follows: Let $n = p_1^{k_1}\cdot p_2^{k_2}\cdot \ldots \cdot p_r^{k_r} \in \mathbb{Z}$ Then Spec $\mathbb{Z}/(n) = \{(p_1), (p_2), \ldots,(p_r)\}$ (With the standard affine structure sheaf, which we shall denote as $\mathcal{O}$ ) They (here, (2),(3), and (5)) are all closed points, as these are maximal ideals, so the topology is the discrete topology Likewise, in the general case this also holds, i.e, each $(p_i)$ is closed since it's maximal and so Spec $\mathbb{Z}/(n)$ has a discrete topology. What are the stalks? You can check that they are $\mathbb{Z}/4$ , $ \mathbb{Z}/3$ , and $\mathbb{Z}/5$ . Here's where I had to work some things out. This is what I understood to be the case in general. Claim: $\mathcal{O}_{(p_i)} = (\mathbb{Z}/(n))_{(p_i)} \simeq \mathbb{Z}/(p_i^{k_i})$ for each $1 \leq i \leq r$ Proof: Let $\pi:\mathbb{Z}/(n) \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}/(p_i^{k_i})$ be the canonical map given by $\bar{x} \mapsto \bar{x}$ . Let $i:\mathbb{Z}/(n) \rightarrow (\mathbb{Z}/(n))_{(p_i)}$ be the standard inclusion $\bar{x} \mapsto \frac{\bar{x}}{1}$ Since $\pi(\mathbb{Z}/(n)-(p_i))$ is the set of units in $\mathbb{Z}/(p_i^{k_i})$ , by the universla property of localization, we have a morphism $\psi:(\mathbb{Z}/(n))_{p_i} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}/(p_i^{k_i})$ such that $\psi \circ i = \pi$ . Similarly, since $i(\bar{p_i}^{k_i}) = \frac{\bar{p_i}^{k_i}}{1} = \frac{\bar{n} }{p_1^{k_1}\cdot p_2^{k_2}\cdot \ldots \cdot p_{i-1}^{k_{i-1}} \cdot p_{i+1}^{k_{i+1}}\cdot \ldots \cdot p_r^{k_r}} = 0$ , by the universal property of quotients, we have a morphism $\gamma : \frac{\mathbb{Z}/(n)}{(p_i^{k_i})} \simeq \mathbb{Z}/(p_i^{k_i}) \rightarrow (\mathbb{Z}/(n))_{(p_i)}$ such that $\gamma \circ \pi = i$ It isn't too difficult to show that $\gamma$ and $\psi$ are inverses of each other. Hence the claim is proved. So far so good (I think). So what are the global sections on this scheme? (here, on $\mathbb{Z}/(60)$ ) They are the sections on this open set $(2)$ , this other open set $(3)$ , and this third open set $(5)$ . In other words, we have a natural isomorphism of rings $\mathbb{Z}/(60) \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}/(4) \times \mathbb{Z}/(3) \times \mathbb{Z}/(5)$ Here's where I'm a little lost in translation. There are three things I don't quite get. 1) If we're looking at global sections on the scheme Spec $\mathbb{Z}/(60)$ , then don't we need to look at $\mathcal{O}($ Spec $\mathbb{Z}/(60))$ and not any of $\mathcal{O} ((2))$ , $\mathcal{O} ((3))$ , and $\mathcal{O} ((5))$ ? I'm still trying to understand schemes and sheaves so I want to understand rigorously what Vakil means here. 2) I know that we can look at $(p_i^{k_i})$ as the principal open $\mathcal{D} $ := D $((p_1^{k_1}\cdot p_2^{k_2}\cdot \ldots \cdot p_{i-1}^{k_{i-1}} \cdot p_{i+1}^{k_{i+1}}\cdot \ldots \cdot p_r^{k_r}))$ and so $\mathcal{O}(\mathcal{D}) = (\mathbb{Z}/(n))_{(p_1^{k_1}\cdot p_2^{k_2}\cdot \ldots \cdot p_{i-1}^{k_{i-1}} \cdot p_{i+1}^{k_{i+1}}\cdot \ldots \cdot p_r^{k_r})}$ I don't see why this localization should give us $\mathbb{Z}/(p_i^{k_i})$ as (I think) he seems to be suggesting when he is looking at sections of $\mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec}\mathbb{Z}/(60)}$ at $(2)$ , $(3)$ , and $(5)$ . 3) How does looking at these global sections automatically give us the desired isomorphism? I don't see the connection between looking at (global) sections of the sheaf and immediately deducing the required isomorphism. I'm still trying to learn how schemes work and am trying to develop an intuition for them. Because of that, I'm not very fluent with translating Vakil's less-rigorous questions to very rigorous claims (Or at the very least, they don't seem to rigorous to me. Though I'm well aware that that's solely a lack of understanding on my part). I'd appreciate any help and thanks for taking the time to read this!

The context is that in chapter 4 of Marker's book on Model Theory, it was proven that $S_n(k)$ coincides with Spec$k[x_1,..,x_n]$ by a continuous bijection $p\mapsto \{f(x)\in k[x]:f(x_1,...,x_n)=0)\in p\}$, i.e by taking those polynomials that define zero inequalities in the type. Now the closed points $J$ of Spec$k[x]$ correspond to Galois orbits of the algebraic closure of $k$, and thus all such $J$ must come from types of elements of $K$ algebraic over $k$. I proved in a previous exercise of Marker's book that types of algebraic elements are isolated. Question 1: However, with the generic point $(0)$ of Spec$k[x]$, I am not sure.  I suspect it is not isolated. So far, I concluded that if $p$ is the corresponding type of $(0)$ then for every nonzero polynomial $f(x)\in k[x]$, the un-equation $f(x)\neq0$  must lie in $p$.

The context is that in chapter 4 of Marker's book on Model Theory, it was proven that $S_n(k)$ coincides with Spec$k[x_1,..,x_n]$ by a continuous bijection $p\mapsto \{f(x)\in k[x]:f(x_1,...,x_n)=0)\in p\}$, i.e by taking those polynomials that define zero inequalities in the type. Now the closed points $J$ of Spec$k[x]$ correspond to Galois orbits of the algebraic closure of $k$, and thus all such $J$ must come from types of elements of $K$ algebraic over $k$. I proved in a previous exercise of Marker's book that types of algebraic elements are isolated. Question 1: However, with the generic point $(0)$ of Spec$k[x]$, I am not sure.  I suspect it is not isolated. So far, I concluded that if $p$ is the corresponding type of $(0)$ then for every nonzero polynomial $f(x)\in k[x]$, the un-equation $f(x)\neq0$  must lie in $p$. This implies $p$ cannot be isolated by a conjunction of polynomial un-equations. I'm not sure how to show formulas of other shapes cannot isolate $p$.

80,Sheaf cohomology via resolutions vs. derived categories,Sheaf cohomology via resolutions vs. derived categories,,"So I know that when introducing sheaf cohomology, there are two main approaches via derived categories, and a perhaps more ""down to earth"" method of resolving by acyclic, fine, soft, sheaves.  I'm curious exactly how these two approaches are related and what the benefits are of one over the other. For a nice topological space $X$, in the category $\rm{Sh}(X)$ of sheaves on $X$, we can search for certain objects in the category like fine, acyclic, soft, sheaves and find resolutions $0 \to \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{C}^{0} \to \mathcal{C}^{1} \to \ldots$ of a sheaf $\mathcal{F}$.  The sheaf cohomology is then given by $H^{q}(X, \mathcal{F}) \simeq H^{q}(X, \mathcal{C}^{*}(X))$. To my very naive eye, in the derived categories approach, we can think of these resolutions as quasi-isomorphisms $\mathcal{F} \simeq [\mathcal{C}^{0} \to \mathcal{C}^{1} \to \ldots]$ in the derived category $\mathcal{D}\rm{Sh}(X)$ of sheaves on $X$.

I'm curious exactly how these two approaches are related and what the benefits are of one over the other. For a nice topological space $X$, in the category $\rm{Sh}(X)$ of sheaves on $X$, we can search for certain objects in the category like fine, acyclic, soft, sheaves and find resolutions $0 \to \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{C}^{0} \to \mathcal{C}^{1} \to \ldots$ of a sheaf $\mathcal{F}$.  The sheaf cohomology is then given by $H^{q}(X, \mathcal{F}) \simeq H^{q}(X, \mathcal{C}^{*}(X))$. To my very naive eye, in the derived categories approach, we can think of these resolutions as quasi-isomorphisms $\mathcal{F} \simeq [\mathcal{C}^{0} \to \mathcal{C}^{1} \to \ldots]$ in the derived category $\mathcal{D}\rm{Sh}(X)$ of sheaves on $X$.

It suggests the natural thing to do would be to define: $O'(V) := \{ f : V \rightarrow K | \text{there is an open } U \in X \text{ such that } U \cap Y = V \text{ and } g|_V = f \text{ for some } g \in O_U \}$ And then it goes on to claim that this is typically not a sheaf, but merely a presheaf, and that the correct thing to do is to sheafify it. I was trying to justify this last line by finding a counterexample to the gluing axiom. This is what I came up with: Let $X = \mathbb{A}^2$, let $Y = \mathbb{V}(xy)$. Then let $U_1 = D(x)$ and $U_2 = D(y)$, which forms a cover of the open subset $Y - {(0,0)}$ of $Y$. Define $f_1 = 0$ and $f_2 = 1$, which are elements of $O'(U_1)$ and $O'(U_2)$ respectively. They have no overlap, since their would-be intersection at the origin has been left out. But when you glue them together, you seem to run into trouble near the origin. (Informally, the polynomial's value seems to approach both $0$ and $1$ as you approach the orign. Less informally, the density of this open set in $Y$ ought to allow you to extend the polynomial to the origin in two distinct ways). My question is simply, is my analysis above valid? I feel like I may have overlooked some assumption somewhere. If it is valid, then what function do you get when you glue together these two functions? If I made a mistake somewhere, could I get some guidance towards a true counter-example?","I'm trying to get an intuition for what sheafification does.

The question of when this is an isomorphism is subtle, but I have two (possibly) simpler questions, neither of which is hopefully ridiculous. First one is pretty quick: isn't it true that while it's obviously difficult for this to be surjective, it is always surjective into the subring of even cohomology representable by closed submanifolds? My understanding is that this is one implication of GAGA; every closed analytic subspace is also a closed algebraic subvariety. My main question, though, is whether the map is always injective - or, at least, if there's nice sufficient (+ necessary would be even better!) conditions for it to be injective. That is, whether a linear combination of closed submanifolds representing 0 in homology implies that the associated algebraic cycle is rationally equivalent to zero.
