Supposing this is true, then to determine uniform convergence, let $d_n(x):= |f_n(x)-f(x)|= nx(1-x)^n - 0$ Then $$ d_n'(x)= n(1-x)^n - n^2(1-x)x = 0$$ if $x=1$. So the maximum of $f_n(x)$ occurs at $x=1$. It follows that: $$0 \le d_n(x)= |f_n(x)-f(x)|< d_n(1) = 0$$ So $(f_n)$ converges uniformly  on $[0,1]$. Would this be correct?

There is one particular step I am confused on. Theorem. The limit of a convergent sequence in a Hausdorff space is unique. Proof. Let $a_n$ be a convergent sequence in a Hausdorf space. Suppose, for a contradiction, that it converges to two different points, $x$ and $y$ . Thus, it follows from converges to $x$ that \begin{align*} \forall \epsilon > 0, \exists N, \forall n > N, |a_n - x | < \epsilon, \end{align*} which is otherwise stated that for all $n > N$ , elements of the sequence lie in some open ball around $x$ with radius $\epsilon$ . From convergence to $y$ , it follows that \begin{align*} \forall \epsilon > 0, \exists N, \forall n > N, |a_n - y| < \epsilon, \end{align*} otherwise stated that for all $n > N$ , elements of the sequence lie in an open ball around $x$ with radius $\epsilon$ . Here is where my confusion comes in. From here, I know I need to draw on the definition of Hausdorff space. These are distinct points, and so there exist open sets around them containing the points, $x$ and $y$ , where these sets are disjoint. This does not imply that every open set containing these points is disjoint. So, it seems that I need to say something to the effect that the definition of convergence allows me to create an open ball (I am using this interchangeable with open set, which I hope isn't incorrect; please correct me, if so) of any radius I want around  the points, and thus it clearly captures all such open sets. Thus, I can pick two separate $N$ 's for each of these sets to form open balls of radius $\epsilon_1$ and $\epsilon_2$ around these points such that the sets are disjoint, which I know I can do via the definition of Hausdorff space. Since this would be true for an infinite number of $n$ past some arbitrary point $N$ , it would not be possible to get ""back inside"" the opening ball around the other point. That's clearly a contradiction to the definition of convergence. Thus, if $a_n$ converges to $x$ , it cannot converge to $y$ , and if it converges to $y$ , it cannot converge to $x$ , so there is only a single possible limit point, which is unique. How does this argument sound? Is there a better way to state it, or have I made an errors in logic?

98,$\sum r(r+1)(r+2)(r+3)$ is equal to?,is equal to?,\sum r(r+1)(r+2)(r+3),"$$\sum r(r+1)(r+2)(r+3)$$ is equal to? Here, $r$ varies from $1$ to $n$ I am having difficulty in solving questions involving such telescoping series. While I am easily able to do questions where a term splits into two terms, such question are not coming to me. I am getting no ideas on how to split such a large term. Maybe a hint or help would get me moving.","$$\sum r(r+1)(r+2)(r+3)$$ is equal to? Here, $r$ varies from $1$ to $n$ I am having difficulty in solving questions involving such telescoping series.

99,Estimating $\sum n^{-1/2}$,Estimating,\sum n^{-1/2},"Could someone please explain me how does one obtain the following estimate: $$ \sum_{n \leq X} n^{-1/2} = \frac12 X^{1/2} + c + O(X^{-1/2}), $$ where $c$ is some constant. Thank you very much! PS As pointed out in the comments, $1/2$ in front of $X^{1/2}$ is a typo... I would like an answer with the correct coefficient here.","Could someone please explain me how does one obtain the following estimate: $$ \sum_{n \leq X} n^{-1/2} = \frac12 X^{1/2} + c + O(X^{-1/2}), $$ where $c$ is some constant.
