3,A Polynomial Formed from the Roots of Another Polynomial ad infinitum,A Polynomial Formed from the Roots of Another Polynomial ad infinitum,,"Let $P(x)$ be a monic polynomial of degree $d$ with complex coefficients. Let $r_1(P),r_2(P),\dots, r_d(P)$ denote the set of roots, ordered so that $|r_1(P)| \leq |r_2(P)|\leq\dots\leq |r_d(P)|$ . Define the map $T$ by: $$(TP)(x)=x^d+r_1(P)x^{d-1}+r_2(P)x^{d-2}+\dots+r_d(P),$$ i.e. $TP$ is the monic polynomial whose coefficients are the roots of $P$ . Let us call a monic polynomial periodic if $T^KP=P$ for some $K>0$ . The question is: for any $d>0$ , does there exist a periodic polynomial of degree $d$ , other than the trivial solution $x^d$ ? Remark on the definition of T As pointed out in the comments, the definition of $TP$ is ambiguous if there are two roots $r_i(P)$ and $r_j(P)$ such that $|r_i(P)|=|r_j(P)|$ and $r_i(P)\neq r_j(P)$ . If the roots of $P$ have this property, then you may break the ties however you please. For example, if $P(x)=x^3-x$ , then it is up to you whether to set $r_2(P)=1$ and $r_3(P)=-1$ or $r_2(P)=-1$ and $r_3(P)=1$ . However, either ordering still must have $r_1(P)=0$ , since there is no ambiguity there. Note that the set of polynomials that have this ambiguity has measure zero, so I suspect such considerations will not influence the solution of the problem anyway. Empirical Evidence If $d=1$ then the answer is clearly yes (any $P(x)=x-a$ will do the job, with $a\ne 0$ ). If $d=2$ then $P(x)=x^2+x-2$ is a fixed point of $T$ , so in particular is periodic with period 1. I examined other low degrees by numerical simulation. Note that this requires relaxing the definition of a cycle, since testing for exact equality of floating point numbers is impossible. Thus, for these simulations, the condition $T^KP=P$ was replaced with $\|T^KP-P\|_\infty<\varepsilon$ , with $\varepsilon=10^{-10}$ . In particular, these simulations can only find polynomials $P$ that are periodic up to some fixed error tolerance. The simulation was done by first initializing the coefficients of $P$ using values drawn from a standard normal distribution, and then iteratively applying $T$ 1000 times and checking whether the obtained sequence was eventually periodic (up to error $<\varepsilon$ ). Note that this method might not find all cycles. The periods found thusly for low degrees are: $$ \begin{array}{rc} d=3 & \text{possible periods}= 1 ; 11 \\ 4 & 21 \\ 5 & 4 ; 56 \\ 6 & 34 ; 44 \\ 7 & 10 ; 15 ; 26 ; 234 \\ 8 & 3 ; 38 ; 83 ; 292 \\ 9 & 256 ; 311 ; 466 \\ 10 & 275 ; 336 \end{array} $$ Furthermore, for degrees $\leq 8$ , all of the simulated sequences eventually became periodic, however this was not true for $d=9$ or $10$ (of course, this does not imply that these sequences never become periodic, just that they did not before the simulation ended).

4,Convergence acceleration technique for $\zeta(4)$ (or $\eta(4)$) via creative telescoping?,Convergence acceleration technique for  (or ) via creative telescoping?,\zeta(4) \eta(4),"Question Is it already known whether the $\zeta(4):=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}1/n^4$ accelerated convergence series $(1)$ , proved for instance in [1, Corollaire 5.3], could be obtained by a similar technique to the ones explained by Alf van der Poorten in [2, section 1] for $\zeta(3)$ and $\zeta(2)$ ? $$\zeta(4)=\frac{36}{17}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{4}\binom{2n}{n}}.\tag{1}$$ (a) In other words, does there exist a pair of functions $F(n,k), G(n,k)$ obeying equation $$F(n+1,k)-F(n,k)=G(n,k+1)-G(n,k)\tag{$\ast$}$$ from which $(1)$ can be proved? That is, is it possible to transform  the defining series for $\zeta(4):=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}1/n^4$ by means of the Wilf-Zeilberger method (or the Markov-WZ Method ) into the faster series $(1)$ ? (b) Most likely there isn't any such a pair $(F, G)$ , but I do not have the means to use these methods on my own. Short description of section 1 of Alf van der Poorten's paper The defining series for $\zeta(3):=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}1/n^3$ and $\zeta(2):=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}1/n^2$ are accelerated resulting in \begin{equation*} \zeta (2)=3\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{1}{n^{2}\binom{2n}{n}},\tag{2} \end{equation*} \begin{equation*} \zeta (3)=\frac{5}{2}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n^{3}\binom{2n}{n}}\tag{3}. \end{equation*} For instance, $(3)$ follows from the identity \begin{equation*} \sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{1}{n^{3}}-2\sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{\left( -1\right) ^{n-1}}{n^{3}\binom{2n}{n}}=\sum_{k=1}^{N}\frac{(-1)^{k}}{2k^{3}\binom{N+k}{k}\binom{N}{k}}-\sum_{k=1}^{N}\frac{(-1)^{k}}{2k^{3}\binom{2k}{k}}\tag{4}, \end{equation*} by letting $N\rightarrow \infty $ and noticing that \begin{equation*} \lim_{N\to\infty}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{k}}{2k^{3}\binom{N+k}{k}\binom{N}{k}}=0. \end{equation*} Equality $(4)$ can be explained as follows: Write \begin{equation*} X_{n,k}=\frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k^{2}\binom{n+k}{k}\binom{n-1}{k}},\qquad D_{n,k}=\frac{(-1)^{k}}{n^{2}\binom{n+k}{k}\binom{n-1}{k}}\qquad k<n. \end{equation*} Notice that $$X_{n,k}=D_{n,k-1}-D_{n,k}.\tag{5}$$ Hence \begin{eqnarray*} \sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\frac{X_{n,k}}{n} &=&\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\left( \frac{D_{n,k-1}}{ n}-\frac{D_{n,k}}{n}\right) =\frac{D_{n,0}}{n}-\frac{D_{n,n-1}}{n} \\ &=&\frac{1}{n^{3}}-2\frac{\left( -1\right) ^{n-1}}{n^{3}\binom{2n}{n}},\qquad\frac{D_{n,0}}{n} =\frac{1}{n^{3}},\quad \frac{D_{n,n-1}}{n}=2\frac{ \left( -1\right) ^{n-1}}{n^{3}\binom{2n}{n}} \end{eqnarray*} Sum over $k$ , $1\leq k\leq n-1$ \begin{equation*} \sum_{k=1}^{n-1}X_{n,k}=\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\left( D_{n,k-1}-D_{n,k}\right) =D_{n,0}-D_{n,n-1}. \end{equation*} Now, summing over $n$ , $1\leq n\leq N$ , and noticing that \begin{equation*} \frac{X_{n,k}}{n}=E_{n,k}-E_{n-1,k},\qquad E_{n,k}=\frac{(-1)^{k}}{2k^{3}\binom{n+k}{k}\binom{n}{k}},\tag{6} \end{equation*} we obtain \begin{equation*} \sum_{k=1}^{N-1}\sum_{n=k+1}^{N}\frac{X_{n,k}}{n}=\sum_{k=1}^{N-1} \sum_{n=k+1}^{N}\left( E_{n,k}-E_{n-1,k}\right) =\sum_{k=1}^{N}\left( E_{N,k}-E_{k,k}\right).  \end{equation*} So, on the one hand \begin{eqnarray*} \sum_{n=1}^{N}\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\frac{X_{n,k}}{n} &=&\sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{1}{ n^{3}}-2\sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{\left( -1\right) ^{n-1}}{n^{3}\binom{2n}{n}},\tag{7} \end{eqnarray*} and on the other hand \begin{eqnarray*} \sum_{n=1}^{N}\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\frac{X_{n,k}}{n}  &=&\sum_{k=1}^{N}E_{N,k}-\sum_{k=1}^{N}E_{k,k} \\ &=&\sum_{k=1}^{N}\frac{(-1)^{k}}{2k^{3}\binom{N+k}{k}\binom{N}{k}} -\sum_{k=1}^{N}\frac{(-1)^{k}}{2k^{3}\binom{2k}{k}}.\tag{8} \end{eqnarray*} The identity $(4)$ follows. Remarks The combination of equations $(5)$ and $(6)$ forms an identity of the form $(\ast)$ , which is equation $(6.1.2)$ of [3, chapter 6] (Zeilberger's Algorithm). As for $(2)$ , [2, section 1] actually explains how to accelerate $\eta(2):=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty }(-1)^{n-1}/n^{2}$ and obtain $(2)$ , using the relation $\eta(s) = \left(1-2^{1-s}\right) \zeta(s)$ .

Rule of the number of zeros (not sure if this is right or not): Don't add zero for the next number if it is ""smaller"" than the previous number. To compare numbers, we only keep the first digit and make the rest of the digits after the decimals point. For example, $13$ in this case is ""smaller"" than $8$ because $1.3<8$ , so we don't add any zero for $13$ -- the same $7$ zeros in front of both $13$ and $8$ . On the other hand, if the number in the sequence is greater than or equal to the previous one, we would add a zero before the greater number. For example, $3>2$ , so we add a zero in front of $3$ , making $5$ zeros in front of $3$ and $4$ zeros in front of $2$ . I think that the rule of the number of zeros applies to all the metallic sequences. If not, let's assume it is for now and keep on reading. I then decided to further explore other metallic sequences. Lets define the $n^{th}$ metallic sequence $$\sigma_n: P_n = nP_{n-1}+P_{n-2}$$ In this post, the Fibonacci sequence is $\sigma_1$ .

34,Proof verification: $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n}=\ln(2)$,Proof verification:,\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n}=\ln(2),"Motivated by the beautiful identity $$\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\tan^{2n}(x)\text{ }dx=(-1)^n\left(\frac{\pi}{4}-\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1}\right)$$ and the equally beautiful proof of $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^n}{2n+1}=\frac{\pi}{4}$$ that it implies, I decided to try and find a closed-form expression for $\int_{0}^{\pi/4}\tan^{2n+1}(x)dx$ . Following the method I used to establish the integral above (reduction formulae), I discovered this stunning identity, true for all $n\geq 1$ (also true for $n=0$ if you accept the empty sum convention). $$\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\tan^{2n+1}(x)\text{ }dx=(-1)^n\left(\frac{1}{2}\ln(2)-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k}\right)$$ As you can probably see, this is very suggestive of the fact that $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n}=\ln(2)$ , so I naturally tried to leverage it in a proof. Here's my attempt: Proof : We'll begin by proving that $\int_{0}^{\pi/4}\tan^{2n+1}(x)\text{ }dx=(-1)^n\left(\frac{1}{2}\ln(2)-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k}\right)$ . We do this with mathematical induction. The base case $n=1$ can be established as follows: \begin{align*} \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\tan^{2(1)+1}(x)dx &= \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\tan^{3}(x)\text{ }dx\\ &= \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\tan(x)\left[\sec^2(x)-1\right]dx\\ &= \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\tan(x)\sec^2(x)\text{ }dx-\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\tan(x)\text{ }dx \end{align*} Making the substitution $u=\tan(x)$ in the first integral gives \begin{align*} \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\tan(x)\sec^2(x)\text{ }dx-\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\tan(x)\text{ }dx &= \int_{0}^{1}u\text{ }du-\left[\ln\left(\sec\frac{\pi}{4}\right)-\ln(\sec 0)\right]\\ &= \frac{1}{2}-\ln(\sqrt{2})\\ &= -\left(\frac{1}{2}\ln(2)-\frac{1}{2}\cdot 1\right)\\ &= (-1)^1\left(\frac{1}{2}\ln(2)-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{k=1}^{1}\frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k}\right) \end{align*} This proves the base case. If we assume that the identity is true for some $m\in\mathbb{N}$ , then \begin{align*} \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\tan^{2(m+1)+1}(x)dx &= \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\tan^{2m+1+2}(x)\text{ }dx\\ &= \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\tan^{2m+1}(x)\tan^{2}(x)\text{ }dx\\ &= \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\tan^{2m+1}(x)\left[\sec^2(x)-1\right]dx\\ &= \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\tan^{2m+1}(x)\sec^2(x)\text{ }dx-\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\tan^{2m+1}(x)\text{ }dx \end{align*} Like before we make the substitution $u=\tan(x)$ in the first integral. Leveraging our assumption, we get \begin{align*} \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\tan^{2m+1}(x)\sec^2(x)\text{ }dx-\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\tan^{2m+1}(x)\text{ }dx &= \int_{0}^{1}u^{2m+1}\text{ }du-(-1)^m\left(\frac{1}{2}\ln(2)-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{k=1}^{m}\frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k}\right)\\ &= \frac{1}{2m+2}-(-1)^m\left(\frac{1}{2}\ln(2)-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{k=1}^{m}\frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k}\right)\\ &= \frac{(-1)^m(-1)^m}{2(m+1)}-(-1)^m\left(\frac{1}{2}\ln(2)-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{k=1}^{m}\frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k}\right)\\ &= (-1)^m\left[\frac{(-1)^m}{2(m+1)}-\left(\frac{1}{2}\ln(2)-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{k=1}^{m}\frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k}\right)\right]\\ &= (-1)^m\cdot -\left(-\frac{(-1)^{m}}{2(m+1)}+\frac{1}{2}\ln(2)-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{k=1}^{m}\frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k}\right)\\ &= (-1)^{m+1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\ln(2)-\frac{(-1)^{(m+1)-1}}{2(m+1)}-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{k=1}^{m}\frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k}\right)\\ &= (-1)^{m+1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\ln(2)-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{k=1}^{m+1}\frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k}\right) \end{align*} This shows that it must be true for $m+1$ . Thus, mathematical induction implies that the identity is true for all natural numbers. We are now in a position to prove that $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n}=\ln(2)$ . Notice that \begin{align*} \left|\frac{1}{2}\ln(2)-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k}\right| &= \left|(-1)^n\left(\frac{1}{2}\ln(2)-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k}\right)\right|\\ &= \left|\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\tan^{2n+1}(x)\text{ }dx\right|\\ &= \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\tan^{2n+1}(x)\text{ }dx \end{align*} since $\tan^{2n+1}(x)\geq 0$ for $0\leq x <\pi/2$ . We can bound the quantity $$\left|\frac{1}{2}\ln(2)-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k}\right|$$ by making the substitution $x=\tan^{-1}(t)$ on the last integral and proceeding as follows \begin{align*} \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\tan^{2n+1}(x)\text{ }dx &= \int_{0}^{1}\frac{t^{2n+1}}{1+t^2}dt\\ &< \int_{0}^{1}t^{2n+1}\text{ }dt\\ &= \frac{1}{2n+2}\\ &= \frac{1}{2(n+1)} \end{align*} This gives the upper bound $\left|\frac{1}{2}\ln(2)-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k}\right|<\frac{1}{2(n+1)}$ , or $$\left|\ln(2)-\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k}\right|<\frac{1}{n+1}$$ Letting $n\to\infty$ and applying the squeeze theorem immediately gives the desired result. $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n}=\ln(2)$$ Q.E.D. If correct, this argument is absolutely beautiful! Not only does it prove the equality $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n}=\ln(2)$$ in a completely elementary fashion, it also establishes this absolutely astounding result: $$\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\tan^{2n+1}(x)\text{ }dx=(-1)^n\left(\frac{1}{2}\ln(2)-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k}\right)$$ In particular, combining this with $\int_{0}^{\pi/4}\tan^{2n}(x)\text{ }dx=(-1)^n\left(\frac{\pi}{4}-\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1}\right)$ , we now have a recipe for evaluating $$\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\tan^{n}(x)\text{ }dx$$ for any natural number $n$ .

UPDATED: If someone could prove that $|p_n-z \cdot p_{n-1}|$ is bounded above (or converges, or diverges), then the proof is complete.",,"['sequences-and-series', 'limits', 'recurrence-relations', 'cauchy-sequences']"

38,An interesting way of expressing any real number using the harmonic series.,An interesting way of expressing any real number using the harmonic series.,,"I recently saw the identity $$ \frac{1}{1} - {1 \over 2} +{1 \over 3} - {1 \over 4} + {1 \over 5} - {1 \over 6} \dotsb = \log(2) $$  which I found rather interesting. I was intrigued by the way a transcendental number like $\log(2)$ could be expressed by using the reciprocals of every integer once. I then wondered what other real numbers could be represented this way, by using the infinite harmonic series, but changing the $+$ or $-$ signs before each fraction. I soon realized that every real number could be represented this way, although not necessarily with such a clear pattern to the signs. Since + and - are binary options, I realized that the pattern of $+$ or $-$'s in the series could be represented by using a binary decimal number between 0 and 0.11111... I called this number the ""harmonic sign number"" (or ""HSN"" for short). For instance, an example of a harmonic sign number for $\log(2)$ would be $0.\overline{10}$, because it alternates between $+$ and $-$, with the 1's representing a + and the 0's representing a -. However, $\log(2)$ is probably a special case, as it has a harmonic sign number that is rational. It seems like most numbers could only be represented by irrational harmonic sign numbers, however that is still up for debate. Another example of a rational HSN would be $0.\overline{1100}$, which is the HSN for ${\pi \over 4} + {\log(2) \over 2}$ Also, every real number has an infinite amount of HSN's, but every HSN corresponds to only one real number (or not, if it doesn't converge). Some questions that I have thought about: Which numbers have rational harmonic sign numbers? Can only trancendental numbers have rational HSN's? If not, is there a quick way to tell whether a number has a rational HSN? Are there any rational numbers that have rational or at least algebraic HSN's? Does there exist a number which is it's own HSN? Are there more than one? Infinite? Which HSN's actually converge? I would suggest that they would have to be normal. Please note, this is done purely out of interest, so only respond if you are actually interested! If you would like clarification also please ask in comments and I will edit.  Also, I'm not looking for full concrete answers. Feel free to answer with anything you have found or is of interest.

[update] : what I've additionally just done was to apply a procedure to find the/a formal power series for the problem of finite sums of consecutive terms. The procedure is that of the approximation of the Neumann-series of the Carleman-matrix for the function $f(x) = \sqrt{\ln(\exp(x^2)+1)}$ which is the iterative transfer function which produces the term of the series for index $n+1$ from the term at index $n$. I'll explain this now in more detail: For the procedure which is also known with the name ""indefinite summation"" we need first a function, which generates the terms of the series to be summed as iterates of itself. What function can transfer $\sqrt{\ln(x)}$ to $\sqrt{\ln(x+1)}$? This is $f(x)$ as given above, because for instance it gives for $z= \sqrt{\ln(5)}$ the result $f( z) = \sqrt{\ln(6)}$ and $f°^2( z) = \sqrt{\ln(7)}$ and so on. So we can formally write the series $$ s_p  =î \cdot ( z + f(z) + f°^2(z) + f°^3(z) + ... ) \qquad \qquad \text{ with } z=\sqrt{\ln(1)}=0 $$ An approach which I've exercised a couple of times is to implement $f()$ by a Carlemanmatrix based on $f()$'s formal powerseries. That powerseries is $$ \mathcal {\text{Taylor}} (f(x)) \approx \small  0.83255461 + 0.30028060 x^2 + 0.020918484 x^4 - 0.0075447481 x^6  + ... $$ Let now $ C = \text{carleman}(f) $ be the Carlemanmatrix for $f(x)$ then the dotproduct of a vector $V(x)=[1,x,x^2,x^3,x^4,...]$ with $C$ gives $V(x) \cdot C= V(f(x))$ by definition, and if we look at the second column of $C$ only we have $V(x) \cdot C_{0..\infty,1} = f(x)$ at least as formal powerseries, and if it is convergent for small $x$ we can also evaluate numerically. Now the idea of the Neumann-series comes into play. As $V(x) \cdot C_{0..\infty,1} = f(x)$ we should formally also have $V(x) \cdot C^2_{0..\infty,1} = f°^2(x)$,  $V(x) \cdot C^3_{0..\infty,1} = f°^3(x)$ and so on, such that we make the ansatz: $$ V(z) \cdot ( C^0 + C^1 + C^2 + C^3 + ... )_{0..\infty,1} \overset?= z + f°(z) + f°^2(z) + f°^3(z) + ... $$ and the key-observation is here, that we have in the parenthese of the lhs the geometric series of the matrix $C$ (such a construct is also called ""Neumann-series""). We can surely expect, that this is no proper sum, but with some examples of alternating geometric series instead I could get meaningful approximations when using empirical approximations to $B = (I+C)^{-1}$ and then approximate for instance $V(z) \underset{\mathfrak E}\cdot B_{0..\infty,1} \approx z - f(z) + f°^2(z) - ... + ...$ where $\mathfrak E$ means Eulersummation in the dotproduct if needed. This is not so simple and straightforward for the non-alternating geometric series. As the Carlemanmatrix of any function has the eigenvalue $1$ (at least once) by construction we would run into $\frac 10$ and cannot immediately try the approximation with finitely truncated matrices $A = ( I - C)^{-1}$. One of the workarounds, which gives sometimes meaningful results is, to omit the first column of $(I - C)$ which gives then some result, but where the first row is then systematically missing/unknown. Remark: a case where this workaround is successful is the problem of the sum-of-like-powers where the Carlemanmatrix is the upper-triangular Pascalmatrix $P$ .

This resembles the identity where denotes the Stirling Numbers of the Second Kind . So maybe the the coefficients can be expressed in terms of Stirling Numbers. 3) I also tried plugging in values of and making a system of equations, but it became tedious to solve. Update (26th November, 2016) : The user @Marko Riedel has discovered a remarkable closed form expression, namely I have put a bounty since I feel that there might be alternate solutions to prove (or maybe even simplify) the above proposition. I'm also looking for any references/links to this problem. Also, the great answers so far reveal that the identity is valid even when is not an integer. Any help will be greatly appreciated.","r^k (r+n)! k ,n \ \in \ \mathbb{Z} \ ;\ k>0 r(r+n)! = (r+n+1)! - (n+1)(r+n)! r^2(r+n)! = (r+n+2)! - (2n+3)(r+n+1)! + (n+1)^2 (r+n)!  r^k (r+n)! = \sum_{m=0}^{k} \lambda_{m} (r+n+m)!   \lambda_{m}  r \lambda_{m} r^k (r+n)! = A(k,n)  r^k(r+n)! = r^{k-1}(\overline{r+n+1} - \overline{n+1})(r+n)! = r^{k-1}(r+n+1)! - r^{k-1} (n+1)(r+n)!   \implies A(k,n) = A(k-1 , n+1) - (n+1)A(k-1,n)  A(k,0) = r^k r!

As there are only two different ways of being cyclic (1,2,3 or 1,3,2), the number of functions for $n=8$ can be calculated as: $$1+\binom85\cdot2+\binom82\binom63\frac12\cdot2^2=1233$$ I could also generalize it for any $n$ as: $$n=3m+p\quad (p=0,1,2)$$ $$a_n=\sum_{k=0}^m\left(\binom{n}{n-3k}\cdot2^k\cdot\frac1{k!}\prod_{i=0}^{k-1}\binom{n-3k}{3}\right)$$ And then I found that $a_n$ are $1,1,3,9,21,81,351,1233,\dots$ that is the sequence in this link https://oeis.org/A001470/internal . In the link, it shows a simple recurrence equation of $$a_n=a_{n-1}+(n-1)(n-2)a_{n-3}$$ But I can't figure out how one can reach to that recurrence equation.

Imagine you have a very large (= infinite, for the purposes of the actual problem) bowl of soup and want to divide it into two halves using a (finite) ladle. The trouble is that some of the good stuff floated to the surface and every scoop takes a part $p$ of it, $p < \frac12$ (so its amount goes down geometrically with a quotient of $1-p$ ). The other good stuff is evenly dissolved in the volume. The protocol is that you always take a full scoop in this manner, so the only freedom is in what order do you empty the ladle into $A$ or $B$ 's plate. What order would you take so that, asymptotically, both parties get fair shares in both respects? Obviously the answer can't be $ABABAB\ldots$ , because $A$ would always get $1/(1-p)$ -times more than $B$ . $\overline{ABBA}$ does not work either because $1+(1-p)^{-3}$ is always greater than $(1-p)+(1-p)^2$ . In fact (except for a countable number of special values of $p$ (*)) it can't be any periodic infinite word of $A$ and $B$ for a slight variant of the same reason. One more thing I found is that the greedy algorithm (go $A$ until it has more than $B$ , then swap) won't work either because while it would always satisfy splitting of the geometrical part, it would break the linear one (number of scoops).

78,Exploiting a Diophantine approximation of $\pi^4$ into giving a series of rationals for $\pi^4$,Exploiting a Diophantine approximation of  into giving a series of rationals for,\pi^4 \pi^4,"A note about this question: The original question asked seems likely impossible so I am really asking if we can exploit the technique below into giving us a 'nice' form for $\pi^4$ . By nice form I mean an explicitly defined series of rationals. A little explanation of the the technique. The technique I use below I reference quite a bit on this site and therefore am putting a nice explanatory picture. The technique is a type of ""Diophantine Approximation"" I suppose. I don't know if the technique goes by a special name. We are going to count the number integer solutions along some Diophantine equation $P(x,y)=n$ . If let $\phi_n$ denote the number of solutions in $\mathbb{Z}$ to $P(x,y)=n$ then we may argue (under some conditions) that $\sum_{n=1}^N \phi_n$ approximates the area of the interior of $P(x,y)=N$ . Let me give a concrete example. Let $P(x,y)=|x|^3+|y|^3$ . The actual area in the interior of $|x|^3+|y|^3=72$ is given by $\frac{72\Gamma(1/3)^3}{4\sqrt{3}\pi} \approx 63.59899501$ and this is weakly approximated by $69$ which is the total number of integers which are on some solution of $|x|^3+|y|^3=n$ as $n$ varies from $0$ to $72$ . Approximating this area as the number of integer solutions should improve as a we let $n$ grow large. Specific Question Let $R$ be a whole number. Is it possible for any whole number $c>0$ that there is a nicer form for $\sum_{r=1}^{R^c}\sum_{d|r}(-1)^{r+d} d^3$ ? I can hope that we can just evaluate this sum but in lieu of that maybe something cheaper computationally.  Taking $c=1$ we can examine: $$f(x)=\sum_{r=1}^{x}\sum_{d|r}(-1)^{r+d} d^3$$ Here is a table of the first 100 values of this function $f$ . This function must grow $O(x^4)$ for reasons which should be clear after reading the exposition. TLDR: $f(x)/x^4$ limits to $\frac{\pi^4}{384}$ as $x$ gets large. Edit 1: After thinking about this specific question I realized it's somewhat an unreasonable ask... In someways this specific question is tantamount to asking the Gauss circle problem but in 8 dimensions and not 2. It's seems that this problem doesn't have an answer for $2$ -d case and it's not likely any easier as we increase the dimension. What I am really after is if we can exploit this summation to arrive at an expression for $\pi^4$ which isn't a divisor sum the same way we can do this in the 2 dimensional case. Full apologies: This is really a different question than the original query but considering the original query is likely impossible... Exposition. Let $\phi_n(r)$ denote the number of integer solutions to the $n$ -dimensional hypersphere $r=\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2$ . The 2-dimensional case. Then discovering $\phi_2(r)=4 \sum_{d|r} \sin(\frac{\pi}{2}d)$ allows us to find a formula for $\pi$ . Namely, Leibniz's formula for $\pi$ . Considering that the sum of number of integer solutions for each $r$ from $1$ to $R^2$ should approximate the volume of a sphere (which for this special case $n=2$ goes by the special name 'circle') with radius $R$ we arrive at: $$\pi R^2 \approx\sum_{r=1}^{R^2}\phi_2(r)$$ and after dividing both sides by $4R^2$ and unpacking our definitions we arrive $$\frac{\pi}{4}=\lim_{R\to\infty} \frac{1}{R^2}\sum_{r=1}^{R^2}\sum_{d|r}\sin \Big(\frac{\pi}{2}d \Big)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty{\frac{1}{n}\sin\Big(\frac{\pi}{2}n \Big)}=1-\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{5}-\frac{1}{7}+ \dots $$ The second equality is sometimes referred to as a dirichlet convolution (I think). And it's this step that I can't seem to be able to take in $8$ -dimensional case. I will skip the 4-dimensional case. But indeed, examining the 4 dimensional case we can achieve $\zeta(2)=\pi^2/6$ . This can be found in the last proof in R. Chapman's compilation of proofs of the Basel problem. MSE has it's own compilation of these by the way. So now that we've seen the development for a $2$ and $4$ dimensional sphere: What's the development for 8-dimensional sphere? Note that the ${\phi_8(r)= 16\sum_{d|r} (-1)^{r+d}d^3}$ which gives a way of approximate the volume of an $8$ -dimensional hypersphere: $$\frac{1}{24}\pi^4 R^8 \approx \sum_{r=1}^{R^2}\phi_8(r)$$ We divide both sides by $16R^8$ to arrive at $$\frac{\pi^4}{384}= \lim_{R\to\infty} \frac{1}{R^8}\sum_{r=1}^{R^2} \sum_{d|r} (-1)^{r+d}d^3$$ In fact! It looks to me like for any whole number $c$ , $$\frac{\pi^4}{384}= \lim_{R\to\infty} \frac{1}{R^{4c}}\sum_{r=1}^{R^c} \sum_{d|r} (-1)^{r+d}d^3$$ This does provide a nice sequence which converges to $\pi^4/384$ . Letting $c=1$ this sequence's rate of convergence is pretty atrocious. $$1,\frac{8}{16},\frac{36}{81},\frac{107}{256},\frac{233}{625},\dots $$ The printed numbers are all accurate to ... zero decimal places... it should converge nonetheless. but taking $c$ larger we arrive at this number much faster. For $c=2$ , $$1,\frac{107}{256},\frac{2113}{6561},\frac{19128}{65536}, \dots $$ Only the last number printed is accurate to the first decimal of $\pi^4/384$ . Can I see anything else here? Is there a closed form for this $$\sum_{r=1}^{R^c}\sum_{d|r}(-1)^{r+d} d^3$$ Sequences of interest include A008457 , A138503 . I think this link may be a good resource but (I am pretty sure) the ""formula"" therein should be labelled as a generating function A055414 .

Is there a way to find all points for which there are infinitely many limit points ie. calculate the borders of these regions directly? To clarify: what I am doing so far is to calculate something like 300 elements of this sequence and check whether $||a_N - a_{N-m}|| < \epsilon\cdot ||a_N||$ for some predefined $\epsilon$ and any $m$. Of course I could just check this repeatedly while calculating the elements, but I want something that is more efficient.",,"['sequences-and-series', 'complex-analysis', 'dynamical-systems', 'fractals']"

It may look like I just picked this number, so let me show this for another random number, say 999. Nine hundred and ninety nine has 24 letters in it, Twenty four has 10 letters in it, Ten has 3 letters in it, Three has 5 letters in it, Five has 4 letters in it. What are your thoughts on how to prove this? (Just a note: I only confirmed this for numbers written in the standard British way of writing numbers - for example 101 is one hundred and one)",,"['number-theory', 'sequences-and-series', 'conjectures']"

Rational numbers in $[0,1]$ are countable.  Can they be ordered as $(q_n)_n$ so that $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{q_n}{n}$ converges? My belief is no, since half the rationals are in the upper half of the interval, the tail of the sum will always have half of its terms $\gt \frac{1}{2n}$ implying divergence.
