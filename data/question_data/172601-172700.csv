5,Why the pdf always exists in statistics textbooks?,Why the pdf always exists in statistics textbooks?,,"I just jumped into statistics, but what confuses me is that all textbooks seem to assume existence of the probability densify function (pdf) of a R.V.?

Then they implicitly use the Radon-Nikodym theorem to write the pdf as the R-N derivative. From real analysis, I know the condition that R-N theorem holds is that the probability measure must be absolutely continuous w.r.t. the dominating measure. But those textbooks do not discuss it. So my question is why we can use the R-N theorem while no discussion of absolute continuity between the two measures? Is there some point I missed?

Prove that no non-constant function of $\theta$ has a UMVUE. My approach: Assume the simplest case $n=1$ . We can use the relationship between UMVUE and unbiased estimator of zero to tackle this issue. Suppose $T(x)$ is a UMVUE for $g(\theta)$ for some function $g$ . Then for an unbiased estimator of zero $U(x)$ , we have $$ E_\theta U = 1/3(U(\theta-1) + U(\theta) + U(\theta+1)) = 0, \ \forall \theta \in \mathbb{Z}, $$ i.e., $$ U(\theta-1) + U(\theta) + U(\theta+1) = 0, \ \forall \theta \in \mathbb{Z}. $$ Then we have $$ U(\theta-1) = U(\theta + 2), \ \forall \theta \in \mathbb{Z}. $$ Now we use the fact that if $T$ is UMVUE, then for any $U$ that is an unbiased estimator of zero, we have $$ E_\theta[TU] = 0. $$ This implies that $TU$ is also an unbiased estimator of zero. Hence, for any unbiased estimator of zero $U$ : $$ T(\theta-1)U(\theta-1) = T(\theta + 2)U(\theta+2), \ \forall \theta \in \mathbb{Z}. $$ This means that $$ T(\theta-1) = T(\theta+2), \ \forall \theta \in \mathbb{Z}. $$ This gives us $$ 1/3(T(\theta-1) + T(\theta) + T(\theta+1)) = 1/3(T(\theta) + T(\theta+1) + T(\theta+2)), \ \forall \theta \in \mathbb{Z}. $$ Now the RHS is $g(\theta)$ while the LHS is $g(\theta+1)$ . Therefore, $$ g(\theta) = g(\theta + 1), \ \forall \theta \in \mathbb{Z}. $$ This shows that $g$ is a constant function of $\theta$ . That is, UMVUE does not exist for non-constant function of $\theta$ . Now the part I am stuck at is how do I prove this for $n > 1$ ?

13,"Difference between random variables, random samples, and observations","Difference between random variables, random samples, and observations",,"Here there is my (difficult to be phrased without looking silly) question: is there an actual difference between a random variable, a random sample, and an observation? [For what below, the books I am reading are De Groot and Schervish's ""Probability and Statistics"" and Spiegel's ""Statistics"" (Schaum's)] Before jumping to the conclusion that I am missing some very basic stuff (which could be, of course), give me a second to explain my problem and read below the example, which could lead to a slightly more precise formulation of the question. Example Given a population of 100 students in a campus, we want to gather some information concerning their heights, such as mean, variance, etc. Thus, on Monday we get a sample of 5 students, on Tuesday we get a sample of other 5 students, and so on until Sunday: we end up having 7 samples, with 5 observations each. In the example above, for what would we use the notation $X_i$ ? I know that notation is just notation, but my point is that $X_i$ is used for many things in statistics and sometime I feel I lose sight of the actual object behind the notation. What I mean is that, by taking the example, my first feeling is that the r.v. is the height, every student is an observation, and we have the 7 samples (this would be my feeling after reading Spiegel). But then, after De Groot and Schervish, I get the feeling that a student is a r.v. in its own right, call it, the $X_i$ random variable. What above becomes even muddier to me when we move to flipping coins (a favourite example of books): if we flip one coin $n$ times and we do it $k$ times to get if it is fair, what is the r.v.? I would say that we have just one r.v., which is the behavior of the coin; also, we have $k$ samples of the behavior of this one coin, with $n$ observations each. Thus, $X_i$ would be reserved for the sample? However, it seems to me that quite often (always), one observation (say the $i$ th) of a head or tail of that one coin is considered a r.v. in itself, thus getting the $X_i$ notation. If you are wondering why this question, simply, I want to get this, because I have the feeling the confusion I have is hampering my possibility of gettings some things right in statistics.

22,How to mathematically explain why the median kill/death ratio is always lower than the mean in battle royale games?,How to mathematically explain why the median kill/death ratio is always lower than the mean in battle royale games?,,"Firstly this is a theory that I'm pretty certain must be true at least under certain conditions, but I don't know how to explain it mathematically. I understand there are many variables I'm not accounting for. FYI: In a battle royale game (BR) players drop in to a specified area that closes over time, fighting till the last man standing, with no respawning. Outside of game-specific mechanics like fall-deaths, the total kill-death ratio (kdr) is a fraction below 1, because the last player doesn't die. Here's my logic now: From the stats I've seen, as well as experience, the median kd should be lower than the mean, I'd guess around 0.7-0.85 for most BR games. It's quite obvious why that is. The top players can sometimes kill 1/4 of the lobby. But I wanted to explain it more mathematically. If you convert the battle royale into a 1v1 single elimination tournament, the distribution is obvious. If there are 8 players, 4 get no kills, 2 get 1, 1 gets 2, and 1 gets 3. From my understanding you can't calculate the mean kd from this because the winner doesn't die, but the median is 0.5. To get the mean I'd add a second game, where all the players who didn't get a kill get on the scoreboard. The KDs would now be 4 with 0.5, 2 with 1 and 2 with 3 (the mean being 1.5 and the median being 0.75). So even with the skill levels being completely flattened (the placing reversed after the first game), the median is still 50% of the mean. If you added skill, and assumed the same players would place highly most of the time, the median would be even lower. Obvious counters to this as a relevant model: yes, players don't fight each other one at a time, and some players will camp for placement. IMO the former would actually accentuate the skewedness of the distribution, as good players are more able to take advantage of third parties. The latter would have no/little effect on kd distribution, as camping till the end to win won't help you if you have to fight good players, and doesn't necessarily improve your kd or harm a high-kd player's anyway. So here's an alternative model: players kill each other in a circle, p1 kills p2, p8 kills p1... and p3 kills p4 to win. Playing twice assuming equal skill you would end up with a distribution like {0, 0.5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3} the mean being 1.1875 and the median being 1}. Even though I think this is less similar to how BRs play out, it still would give a lower mean than median. I was wondering how I could improve upon the logic and make it more useful.  Is it a convincing argument? Is there a way I could combine the first and second models?

23,"What is the Covariance of Two Bernoulli Random Variables coming from the same sample, under design-based approach?","What is the Covariance of Two Bernoulli Random Variables coming from the same sample, under design-based approach?",,"The scenario for the question is as follows: We draw a sample of size n from a population of size N. Assume a design-based approach (meaning the variable of interest $y_i$ (where $i$ represent the $i^{th}$ unit in the population) has fixed value and is unknown. The random variable $Z_1, Z_2, Z_3, ....Z_i..., Z_N$ represent if the $i_{th}$ unit in the population is in sample or not. In other words: $Z_i = 1$ if unit i is in the sample, and equals $0$ otherwise. We choose an Simple Random Sample (SRS) of size n out of the N population units, and the $Z_i$ 's are identically distributions Bernoulli random variable with $p_i=P(Z_i=1)=P(select\space unit\space i \space\ in\space the \space sample)=n/N$ and $P(Z_i=0)=P(select\space unit\space i \space\ in\space the \space sample)=(1-(n/N))$ The question involves finding the value for $E[Z_iZ_j]$ and $Cov(Z_i, Z_j)$ My questions are the following: 1.) What is the meaning of the random variable $Z_iZ_j$ ? From what I understand, it is a function tha maps from the set of all possible outcomes to the real numbers. There are 4 possible outcomes concerning the combination of the two random variables $Z_i$ and $Z_j$ : 1.) both are in sample, 2.) both are not in sample, 3.) i is in sample, j is not in sample, 4.) i is not in sample, j is in sample. The caluclation of $E[ZiZj]$ given in the textbook (Sampling: Design and Analysis, by  Sharon Lohr, second edition, page 52, if you happen to have the book) considers only the conditional probability of both units in sample when calculating the expectation. I can find the probability for each of the 4 scenarios listed above, but i do not understand what value should they take on.

37,Covariance basic properties and understanding,Covariance basic properties and understanding,,"Let's consider two random variables $A$ and $B$ having joint probability distribution $P(A,B)$ . I would like to understand better the limit cases of the correlation coefficient $r=\frac{C(A,B)}{\sigma(A)\sigma(B)}$ I first show what I understand and where I struggle. In the case $A$ and $B$ are not correlated, it means that $P(b|a)=P(b)$ (or equivalently $P(a|b)=P(a)$ ). In this case: $\int da db P(a,b) *a*b = \int da P(a)*a \int db P(b)*b$ which implies $C(A,B)=0$ and thus $r=0$ . In the case $A$ and $B$ are perfectly correlated, I can imagine a specific case which is: $P(b|a)=\delta(b-a)$ ( $b$ is always equal to $a$ ). Then we have: $$P(a) = \int db P(a,b) = \int da P(a) \delta(b-a) = P(b)$$ And finally: $$C(A,B)=\int da db P(a,b) a*b = \int da db P(a) \delta(b-a) * a * b - \int da P(a)*a \int db P(b)*b=Var(A)$$ And as $P(a)=P(b)$ I have $Var(A)=\sigma(A)^2=\sigma(A) \sigma(B)$ which proves $r=1$ .

43,"Asymptotic distribution of U-statistic based ""log-likelihood""","Asymptotic distribution of U-statistic based ""log-likelihood""",,"This is question 4.2c from John Duchi's course Stats 300b at Stanford: http://web.stanford.edu/class/stats300b/Exercises/all-exercises.pdf Consider the U-statistic-based ""Log-likelihood"" type objective: $$L_n(\theta) = {n \choose 2}^{-1} \sum_{i,j}^n 1\{Y_i > Y_j\} \log P_{\theta}(Y_i > Y_j | x_i, x_j) $$ where we have $n$ samples of $(Y_i, x_i)$ such that: $$Y_i = x_i^T \theta + \epsilon_i$$ $$\epsilon_i ∼ N(0, 1)$$ $$E[x_i] = 0, Cov[x_i] = \Sigma$$ Let $\hat{\theta}_n = argmax_{\theta} L_n(\theta)$ and assuming that $\hat{\theta}_n$ is consistent for the true $\theta$ : Find the asymptotic distribution of $\hat{\theta}_n$ . My approach has been (using theorem 5.23 from Asymptotic Statistics by Van der Vaart) to seek the asymptotic distribution of $\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta)$ which under suitable regularity conditions is asymptotically normal with mean $0$ and variance: $$V_\theta^{-1}E[\nabla L_n \nabla L_n^T]V_\theta^{-1}$$ where $V_\theta^{-1} = E[\nabla^2L_n]$ and expectation is taken with respect to data and derivatives are taken with respect to $\theta$ . My difficulty has been in evaluating these expectations to determine the variance of this estimator. $\nabla L_n$ looks like a U-statistic with kernel $h(x_1, x_2) = 1\{Y_i > Y_j\}\nabla_\theta \log P_{\theta}(Y_1 > Y_2 | x_1, x_2)$ . So, $\sqrt{n}(\nabla L_n - E[\nabla L_n])$ is asymptotically $N(0, 2^2\xi_1)$ where $\xi_1$ is the variance of : $$\xi_1 = Cov(h(X, X_i), h(X, X_j)) = E(h(X, X_i)h(X, X_j)) - E(h(X, X_i)) E(h(X, X_j))$$ But I'm also having trouble evaluating this covariance. EDIT: A friend showed me a few tricks, but I dont seem much closer to having a neat closed form (if there is one). At a closer look, $L_N$ is not a log-likelihood, so let's go after $V_\theta$ and $E[\nabla L_n \nabla L_n^T]$ to apply theorem 5.23 directly. First, we have: $$\log P_{\theta}(Y_i > Y_j | x_i, x_j) = \log P_{\theta}(\epsilon_j - \epsilon_i < (x_i - x_j)^T\theta | x_i, x_j) = \log \Phi \bigg(\frac{(x_i-x_j)^T\theta}{\sqrt2}\bigg)$$ Evaluating $\xi_1$ we have for the first moment: $$E(h(X, X_i)) = E [1_i\frac{(X - X_i)\phi(\gamma_i)}{\Phi(\gamma_i)}]$$ where $\gamma_i = \frac{(X - X_i)^T\theta}{\sqrt{2}}$ and $1_i = 1\{Y > Y_i\}$ . By conditioning on the event in the indicator and applying the tower property of expectation: $$ = E [(X - X_i)\phi(\gamma_i)] $$ which is equal to $0$ by symmetry. So, $$\xi_1 = E [(1_i\frac{(X - X_i)\phi(\gamma_i)}{\Phi(\gamma_i)})(1_j\frac{(X - X_j)\phi(\gamma_j)}{\Phi(\gamma_j)})^T]$$ Simplifying as before: $$= E [\phi(\gamma_i)\phi(\gamma_j)(X - X_i)(X - X_i)^T$$ Which I cannot simplify any further. Applying similar simplifications to $\nabla^2 L_n(\theta)$ we have: $$\nabla^2 L_n(\theta) = -\frac{\phi(\gamma_{ij})^2}{\Phi(\gamma_{ij})}(X_i-X_j)(X_i-X_j)^T/2$$ where $\gamma = \frac{(X_i-X_j)^T\theta}{\sqrt2}$ . EDIT: Using this expression to simulate the asymptotic variance, we get what we expect intuitively, this estimator works better than the least-squares estimator when the variance of the noise term $\epsilon$ is smaller than that of the covariates $x_i$ .

My difficulty has been in evaluating these expectations to determine the variance of this estimator. looks like a U-statistic with kernel . So, is asymptotically where is the variance of : But I'm also having trouble evaluating this covariance.

At a closer look, is not a log-likelihood, so let's go after and to apply theorem 5.23 directly. First, we have: Evaluating we have for the first moment: where and . By conditioning on the event in the indicator and applying the tower property of expectation: which is equal to by symmetry. So, Simplifying as before: Which I cannot simplify any further. Applying similar simplifications to we have: where .

91,Describing bursts of Poisson arrivals: help verify whether these two perspective or models the same.,Describing bursts of Poisson arrivals: help verify whether these two perspective or models the same.,,"Introduction: I currently have a sensor that picks up the inter-arrival times of vehicles. These inter-arrival times occur in aggregated bursts because there is a traffic light up-stream. So essentially, we have very short inter-arrival times clustered together with mean batch size $N$ which are separated by long inter-arrival times. Problem Description I am interested in two different perspectives that are taken to describe these batches of short inter-arrival times. They are as follows: We have a Poisson process with rate $\mu$ such that vehicles are separated on average by $\frac{1}{\mu}$ amount of time within this batch. This Poisson process is only allowed to be active for an Exponential distributed amount of time $\frac{1}{\lambda}$ . This is like a continuous-time Markov process that dictates how long the active Poisson process may run for. We take a Renewal style approach to this. We have i.i.d. Exponential distributed inter-arrival times of length $\frac{1}{\mu}$ . We observe on average $N$ of these inter-arrivals. We would observe $N(t)$ to be a Poisson Process with rate $\lambda$ . I would like to show that these two perspectives are the same. My attempt: To show that they are the same, it will suffice to show that $P(N(t)=k)$ is the same for both. Here $t$ is the duration of the batch/burst/activity and N(t) is the amount of vehicles or inter-arrivals that are found in the batch. Case 1: We have a Poisson process with rate $\mu$ that is only allowed to run for $t$ amount of time. However, $E[t] = \frac{1}{\lambda}$ . Hence, $$ P(N(t)=k) = \frac{(\mu t)^k e^{-(\mu t)}}{k!} $$ $$\therefore P(N(t)=k) = \frac{(\frac{\mu}{\lambda})^k e^{-(\frac{\mu}{\lambda})}}{k!} = P \left( N \left( \frac{1}{\lambda} \right) =k  \right)   $$ We must note that $\mu > \lambda$ such that $t_{burst} > t_{arrival}$ . We can thus say $N = \max\{n: n \leq \frac{\mu}{\lambda} \} $ Case 2: This perspective is tricky for me. A Poisson process usually has to be observed for a fixed interval of time. We have an expected fixed interval of time which is the length of a burst. So our Poisson data/counts gives rise to a rate in the form of $n$ counts per $E[t]$ interval of time. Here $E[t]$ should be the sum of $N$ inter-arrivals each of which have mean length $\frac{1}{\mu}$ . Intuitively, we then have $N \times \frac{1}{\mu}$ as the the length of the burst. But $E[N]=\lambda$ such that $E[t] = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}$ . Hence the overall process is Poisson with rate $\frac{\mu}{\lambda}$ as in case 1. I try to describe the intuitive explanation in more Math-like terms. Let $$ S_{N(t)} = \sum_{i=1}^{N(t)} X_i $$ $S_{N(t)}$ would then be a burst length. Furthermore, it has an Erlang probability distribution function. Now we have $$P(N(t)=k) = P(S_k \leq E[t]; X_{k+1} \geq E[t] - S_k)$$ $$ \therefore P(N(t)=k) = P(S_k \leq \frac{1}{\lambda}; X_{k+1} \geq \frac{1}{\lambda} - S_k)$$ $$  \therefore P(N(t)=k) = \int_0^{\frac{1}{\lambda}} \int_{\frac{1}{\lambda}-s}^{\infty} \left(  \frac{\mu^k s^{k-1} e^{-\mu s}}{(k-1)!}  \right) \mu e^{-\mu x} \, dx \, ds $$ $$ \therefore P(N(t)=k) = \frac{\mu^k}{(k-1)!} \int_0^{\frac{1}{\lambda}} (s^{k-1} e^{-\mu s}) e^{-\mu (\frac{1}{\lambda} - s)} \, ds $$ $$ \therefore P(N(t)=k) = \frac{(\frac{\mu}{\lambda})^k e^{-(\frac{\mu}{\lambda})}}{k!}   $$ This is the same as in above.

Thank you.","It is assumed that the quality characteristic of interest, denoted by , follows a Normal distribution with mean and variance . We take a sample of size at time and measure its quality characteristic.  The EWMA statistic at time , denoted by , is (Eq.1) where is the sample mean at time t and k is a constant. Attempt Q1 : I now assume , is this correct? Therefore, And for the variance, Q2 : Above, I asumed and are independent, since are independent. Q3 : Is independent from and ?
