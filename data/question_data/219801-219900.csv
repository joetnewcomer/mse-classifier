And I could agree with my friend too, but if we take a curve to be $y = x^2$ and tangent to be $y = 0$ than there is no point except $(0,0)$ that is common to them. No point in any small neighbourhood around $(0,0)$ is common to both. That seems to only reinforce myself. Question How many points do a tangent and its curve actually share?

Then if an element of the form $$\sum a_{i}\otimes b_{j}$$ is nilpotent, we can compose it with any $k$-homomorphism $f$ from $A$ to $k$ to get a homomorphism from $A\otimes B$ to $B$. This map's image is $$\sum f(a_{i})\otimes b_{j}$$must be nilpotent as well. So if we assume $b_{j}$ is linearly independent in the first place, we may reason that $f(a_{i})=0$. This showed that $a_{i}$ are in the Jacobson radical of $A$. However, we only know $\mathrm{Nil}(A)=0$, and it is not clear to me how to pass from the Jacobson radical to the nilradical without using some commutative algebra machinery. Here is what I think that might work. If $A$ is of finite type, then by Nullstellensatz we can assert the above is true. But if $A$ is not of finite type, then I can write $A=k[x_{1},...,x_{n}][X]$, where $n$ is the transcendence degree of $k(A)$ and $k[X]$ is finite over $k$. Then I should be able to pass from $k[X]$ to $A$ by inductive argument on the transcendental degree of $k(A)$, since prime ideals are maximal in a UFD (I am working with $k[x]$ by introducing $[x]$). The proof I have for the case of finite type is not satisfying. Given $I\subset k[X]$, using Nullstellensatz one can show that $$I_{X}V_{X}[I]=\sqrt{I}$$ where $V_{X}[I]$ is the set of all points in $X$ on which $I$ vanishes, and $I_{X}(V_{X}[I])$ be the ideal in $k[X]$ which vanishes on $V_{X}[I]$. Granting this, let $I=(a_{i})$, then we want to show $I=0$, which is $V_{X}[I]=X$. This follows since if $U\subset W$, then $V_{X}[U]\supset V_{X}[W]$. Since $V_{X}[I]\supset V_{X}[m_{x}]$ for all maximal ideal corresponding to points, it must be $X$. This proof is unnecessarily winding by using the ideal-variety correspondence. Ideally I should be able to construct a pure algebraic proof. The thing not clear to me is whether the above strategy really works. Namely I am not sure if I can really induct on the transcendental degree of $k(A)$. To make matters simple assume we showed the statement holds for $A$ with transdental degree $<n$. For $A$ with transdental degree $n$ we can thus write it as $k[A'][x]$. Then any maximal ideal $m'$ of $k[A'][x]$ must correspond to a maximal ideal $m=m'\cap k[A']$ in $k[A']$. But it seems not possible to show that any prime ideal is maximal. Indeed considering the simple example of $k[x,y]$, where $(x)$ is a prime ideal but not maximal since $k[x,y]/(x)=k[y]$ is not a field. The problem is in the inducting process the base ring is not neccessarily a field, and so this strategy cannot work. I am thinking maybe I can show $m'=m[f(x)]$ with $f(x)$ some irreducible polynomial in $k[A'][x]$. Because we know $k[A'][x]$ is noetherian by Hilbert's basis theorem, so in particular $m'$ must have a finite generating set.

Can I simply switch categories an assume that the affine group schemes are fppf-sheaves? What is a surjective map in the category of fppf-sheaves? And/Or: how is a surjective map of fppf-sheaves related to ""$\mathcal O(Q)\to \mathcal O(G)$ is faithfully flat""? And finally, what happens if G and Q are not affine? What is the right notion of a surjective map?",,"['algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-groups', 'group-schemes']"

Here's what I've done so far: first, let $f:V\to W$. Recall that the map $\beta(f)$ between topological spaces sends an irreducible closed subset of $V$, say $C$, to $\overline{f(C)}\in tW$. We have a bijection between open sets $U$ in $V$ and open sets $tU$ in $tV$, this allows us to define $\beta(f)^{\sharp}$ between the sheaves.

The question (in notation to be defined) is this: how do I show that each point in the support of $D$ is contained in some set in $B$ ? Let $X$ be a Noetherian normal scheme, $\mathcal L$ an invertible sheaf on $X$ , and $s$ a rational section, $D = \mathrm{div}(s)$ . This means that $s$ is an equivalence class of sections over open sets containing all of the associated points of $X$ . We associate to $D$ a sheaf $\mathcal O_X(D)$ defined by $$\mathcal O_X(D)(U) = \{t\in K(X):\: \mathrm{div}\rvert_{U}(t)+D\geq 0\},$$ where $K(X)$ is the total quotient ring of $X$ , which coincides with the function field if $X$ is irreducible. Part of the exercise is to show that $B = \{\mathrm{open}\: U\subset X:\: \mathcal O(\mathrm{div}(s)) \rvert_U \cong \mathrm O_U \}$ is a base for the Zariski topology on X. On each such set it is easy to see that $\mathcal O_X(D)(U)\longrightarrow \mathcal O_X(U)\longrightarrow \mathcal L(U)$ defined by $t\longmapsto t\longmapsto ts$ is an isomorphism, so in the end we find that $\mathcal O_X(\mathrm{div}(s))\cong \mathcal L$ . The complement $U$ of (the support of) $D$ is such an open set; sections over $U$ are those $t\in K(X)$ having nonnegative valuation at every codimension 1 point contained in $U$ . Since $X$ is normal, $\mathcal O_X(U)$ is normal, so Hartog's lemma gives that $$\mathcal O_X(U) = \bigcap_{q\in U, \mathrm{codim}(q)=1}\mathcal O_{X,q},$$ so we find that $t\in \mathcal O_X(U).$ Taking distinguished open sets in $U$ gives a basis in U, so we need only consider those points in the support of $D$ . Suppose $p\in D$ . If $p$ lies is only one prime divisor $Y$ in $D$ , then the complement $U$ of the other componenets is an open set over which the only constraint on sections of $\mathcal O_X(D)$ is that they satisfy $v_Y(t)+v_Y(s)\geq 0$ ( $v_Y$ being the valuation on $\mathcal O_{X,Y}$ ), so I should be able to find an isomorphism of $\mathcal O_X(D)(U)\cong \mathcal O_X(U)$ gotten by multiplying by an appropriate power of a uniformizer in $\mathcal O_{X,Y}$ , but I'm not sure how to make this go.

This question is closely related to my previous one here . I am considering the two rings $k[X]=k[x,y,z]/\langle xy,xz,yz\rangle$ and $k[Y]=k[x,y]/\langle xy(x-y)\rangle$. The question is if $X\subseteq\mathbb{C}^3$ and $Y\subseteq\mathbb{C}^2$ are isomorphic as schemes, and a hint is to define and compute the tangent space of such a scheme at the origin. If I regard $X$ as an affine scheme $\operatorname{Spec}k[X]$, and if $\mathcal{O}_X$ is its structure sheaf, then the origin 'is' the maximal ideal $\mathfrak{p}=\langle x,y,z\rangle\subseteq k[X]$. Then $\mathcal{O}_{X,\mathfrak{p}}\cong k[X]_\mathfrak{p}$, which is a local ring with maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}:=\mathfrak{m}_{X,\mathfrak{p}}=\mathfrak{p}k[X]_\mathfrak{p}$. I can then define the tangent space of $X$ at the origin as the dual space of $\mathfrak{m}_{X,\mathfrak{p}}/\mathfrak{m}_{X,\mathfrak{p}}^2$ I guess. But what is the standard procedure to compute such tangent spaces? Can one do this without 'computing' the ring $k[X]_\mathfrak{p}$ first (maybe by finding a basis of the tangent space by looking at $\mathfrak{m}$ directly)? In any case I would like to know what $k[X]_\mathfrak{p}$ and $k[Y]_{\langle x,y\rangle}$ are, but as usual I can't think of a way to 'simplify' these. Does it ever help that localization commutes with taking quotients in actual computations like these? The maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ consists of fractions $\frac{f}{g}$, where $f\in\mathfrak{p},g\notin\mathfrak{p}$, i.e. where $f$ doesn't have a constant term while $g$ has a non-zero one. $\mathfrak{m}^2$ has as generators products of two elements of the above form, in particular the numerator has only degree-2 or higher terms. So elements in the quotient have a numerator with only degree-1 terms? This would be consistent with the naive $\mathfrak{m}/\mathfrak{m}^2=\mathfrak{p}_\mathfrak{p}/(\mathfrak{p}_\mathfrak{p})^2=(\mathfrak{p}/\mathfrak{p}^2)_\mathfrak{p}$, from which I don't really know if I am allowed to calculate like this. As you can see, I'm confused ;) Answers to the various questions above would be very much appreciated, as wells as hints on how to go on with computing the tangent space, and on how to compute the local rings above. My (very vague) guess would be that we get a basis of the dual of the tangent space of $X$ at the origin by taking $x/1,y/1,z/1$, hence a 3-dimensional vector space, which for $Y$ can never happen, as this should be the only way to show $X$ and $Y$ are not isomorphic via tangent spaces at a certain point!? But I could also be totally wrong here. Edit: Again, I forgot the geometry: Can I guess from the geometric picture ($X$ is the union of the three coordinate axes in $\mathbb{C}^3$, while $Y$ consists of the two coordinate axes plus the line $y=x$ in $\mathbb{C}^2$) what the tangent spaces at these two (clearly singular) points should be?

97,Help understanding closed subschemes and closed immersions,Help understanding closed subschemes and closed immersions,,"Closed subschemes and closed immersions of schemes have been causing me a lot of confusion for a while now. I have a few questions that I think might clear things up. Please assume that when I use the term ""ring"" that I mean ""commutative ring with identity"" whose morphisms take $0 \mapsto 0$ and $1 \mapsto 1$. Sorry for the long question, but I feel it is necessary to spell out the definitions I am working with rather than expect people to chase them up. My first exposure to this was Hartshorne page 85. There he makes the following definitions: A closed immersion is a morphism of schemes $\iota: Y \longrightarrow X$ such that $\iota$ induces a homeomorphism of sp$(Y)$ onto a closed subset of sp$(X)$, and further that the induced map of sheaves, $\iota^{\#}: \mathcal{O}_{X} \longrightarrow \iota_{*}\mathcal{O}_{Y}$ is surjective. A closed subscheme is an equivalence class of closed immersions, where we say that $\iota: Y \longrightarrow X$ and $\iota': Y' \longrightarrow X$ are equivalent if there is an isomorphism $\psi: Y' \longrightarrow Y$ satisfying $\iota' = \iota \circ \psi$. After having a bit of confusion with the closed subscheme part, I consulted Görtz & Wedhorn where, on page 84 (Definition 3.41) they give their own definitions. Their definition for a closed immersion is identical, however their definition for a closed subscheme is as follows: A closed subscheme of a scheme $X$ is given by a closed subset $Y \subseteq X$ (let $\iota: Y \hookrightarrow X$ be the inclusion) and a sheaf $\mathcal{O}_{Y}$ on $Y$ such that $(Y, \mathcal{O}_{Y})$ is a scheme, and such that the sheaf $\iota _{*}\mathcal{O}_{Y}$ is isomorphic to $\mathcal{O}_{X}/ \mathcal{I}$ for $\mathcal{I}$ a subsheaf of ideals of $\mathcal{O}_{X}$. With that in place, my question is basically threefold: 1) Aside from the suggestive name, Hartshorne doesn't seem to suggest (at least not to me) that a closed subscheme is actually a scheme. Indeed, how does one even make sense of putting a scheme structure on an equivalence class of morphisms? 2) Görtz & Wedhorn seem to overcome this by simply defining it to be a scheme. How are their definitions equivalent (if they are)? One big problem I am having seeing this equivalence is relating the surjectivity of $\iota^{\#}$ and $\iota^{'\#}$ to the sheaf of ideals in Görtz & Wedhorn. The issue is, since the category of rings is not abelian (indeed, not even additive as far as I know), I can't expect to have kernels and cokernels, and so I can't expect to be able to take $\mathcal{I}$ to be the kernel of the surjective morphisms like I could if they were sheaves of abelian groups. 3) I tried to play around with the affine case in Hartshorne's definition to make sense of things. Let $A$ be a ring with ideals $\mathfrak{a}$ and $\mathfrak{b}$. These give morphisms of schemes Spec$(A /\mathfrak{a}) \longrightarrow$ Spec $A$ and Spec$(A /\mathfrak{b}) \longrightarrow$ Spec $A$ which induce homemorphisms onto the closed sets in the obvious way. My intuition suggests that these should be ""equivalent"" (for the purposes of defining a closed subscheme) precisely if $\mathfrak{a}$ and $\mathfrak{b}$ have the same radical, since then $V(\mathfrak{a})$ and $V(\mathfrak{b})$ would be the same. Indeed the radical is just the intersection of all primes containing them. However, by Hartshorne's definition, that would require that the isomorphism $i$ be induced by an isomorphism of rings $A / \mathfrak{a} \simeq A/ \mathfrak{b}$ whenever $\mathfrak{a}$ and $\mathfrak{b}$ have the same nilradical, which is obviously nonsense. The long of the short is I am stumped and incredibly confused. Any advice, or references, or answers (partial or full) to all or any of these questions would be greatly appreciated. Bonus question: Is there a way to fix my confusion $\textit{without}$ resorting to quasi-coherent sheaves?","Closed subschemes and closed immersions of schemes have been causing me a lot of confusion for a while now.

Please assume that when I use the term ""ring"" that I mean ""commutative ring with identity"" whose morphisms take $0 \mapsto 0$ and $1 \mapsto 1$. Sorry for the long question, but I feel it is necessary to spell out the definitions I am working with rather than expect people to chase them up. My first exposure to this was Hartshorne page 85. There he makes the following definitions: A closed immersion is a morphism of schemes $\iota: Y \longrightarrow X$ such that $\iota$ induces a homeomorphism of sp$(Y)$ onto a closed subset of sp$(X)$, and further that the induced map of sheaves, $\iota^{\#}: \mathcal{O}_{X} \longrightarrow \iota_{*}\mathcal{O}_{Y}$ is surjective. A closed subscheme is an equivalence class of closed immersions, where we say that $\iota: Y \longrightarrow X$ and $\iota': Y' \longrightarrow X$ are equivalent if there is an isomorphism $\psi: Y' \longrightarrow Y$ satisfying $\iota' = \iota \circ \psi$. After having a bit of confusion with the closed subscheme part, I consulted Görtz & Wedhorn where, on page 84 (Definition 3.41) they give their own definitions. Their definition for a closed immersion is identical, however their definition for a closed subscheme is as follows: A closed subscheme of a scheme $X$ is given by a closed subset $Y \subseteq X$ (let $\iota: Y \hookrightarrow X$ be the inclusion) and a sheaf $\mathcal{O}_{Y}$ on $Y$ such that $(Y, \mathcal{O}_{Y})$ is a scheme, and such that the sheaf $\iota _{*}\mathcal{O}_{Y}$ is isomorphic to $\mathcal{O}_{X}/ \mathcal{I}$ for $\mathcal{I}$ a subsheaf of ideals of $\mathcal{O}_{X}$. With that in place, my question is basically threefold: 1) Aside from the suggestive name, Hartshorne doesn't seem to suggest (at least not to me) that a closed subscheme is actually a scheme. Indeed, how does one even make sense of putting a scheme structure on an equivalence class of morphisms? 2) Görtz & Wedhorn seem to overcome this by simply defining it to be a scheme. How are their definitions equivalent (if they are)? One big problem I am having seeing this equivalence is relating the surjectivity of $\iota^{\#}$ and $\iota^{'\#}$ to the sheaf of ideals in Görtz & Wedhorn. The issue is, since the category of rings is not abelian (indeed, not even additive as far as I know), I can't expect to have kernels and cokernels, and so I can't expect to be able to take $\mathcal{I}$ to be the kernel of the surjective morphisms like I could if they were sheaves of abelian groups. 3) I tried to play around with the affine case in Hartshorne's definition to make sense of things. Let $A$ be a ring with ideals $\mathfrak{a}$ and $\mathfrak{b}$. These give morphisms of schemes Spec$(A /\mathfrak{a}) \longrightarrow$ Spec $A$ and Spec$(A /\mathfrak{b}) \longrightarrow$ Spec $A$ which induce homemorphisms onto the closed sets in the obvious way. My intuition suggests that these should be ""equivalent"" (for the purposes of defining a closed subscheme) precisely if $\mathfrak{a}$ and $\mathfrak{b}$ have the same radical, since then $V(\mathfrak{a})$ and $V(\mathfrak{b})$ would be the same. Indeed the radical is just the intersection of all primes containing them. However, by Hartshorne's definition, that would require that the isomorphism $i$ be induced by an isomorphism of rings $A / \mathfrak{a} \simeq A/ \mathfrak{b}$ whenever $\mathfrak{a}$ and $\mathfrak{b}$ have the same nilradical, which is obviously nonsense. The long of the short is I am stumped and incredibly confused. Any advice, or references, or answers (partial or full) to all or any of these questions would be greatly appreciated.

99,Are varieties locally contractible?,Are varieties locally contractible?,,"Supposed that $X \subset K^n$ is the zero set of some polynomials, where $K = \mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$. Is it the case that for every point $x \in X$ there is an $\epsilon > 0$ so that $B = B_{\epsilon}(x) \cap X$ is contractible around $x$? $(B_{\epsilon}$ is a ball of radius $\epsilon$ in the ambient Euclidean space.) Seems so but I don't know how to prove it. My guess would be to show that there is a neighborhood where all of the homotopy groups vanish, and this presumably follows from some finiteness about the topology of an algebraic variety.

Just wondering.
