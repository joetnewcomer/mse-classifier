0,Is this an alternative definition of the Lebesgue integral?,Is this an alternative definition of the Lebesgue integral?,,"I am a complete beginner in measure theory and have only been reading Tao's notes on them for the past couple of days. Therefore what I say might be a triviality or just plain wrong. Anyway, Tao covers the Jordan measure, followed by the Lebesgue measure followed by the Lebesgue integral. His definition of the Lebesgue integral is stepwise, first defining it for simple functions and then approximating functions using these simple functions. This approach is a little complicated, for instance you have to show that the decomposition into simple functions is irrelevant and so on. However, given the definition of a Lebesgue measure, would the following also be a definition of the Lebesgue integral: For a function $f: \mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R$, define: $$\int fd\mu = \mu(\overline\Gamma_+) - \mu(\overline\Gamma_-)$$ where: $$\overline\Gamma_+ = \{(x,y) \in \mathbb R^n\times\mathbb R : y \in [0,f(x)], f(x) \geq 0\}$$ and similarly: $$\overline\Gamma_- = \{(x,y) \in \mathbb R^n\times\mathbb R : y \in [0,f(x)], f(x) \leq 0\}$$ We will call $f$ Lebesgue integral if $\overline\Gamma$ is Lebesgue measurable. If $\mu$ is the Jordan measure, then it is not hard to see that this is simply the usual definition of the Riemann integral and is in fact, quite close to how we normally think about it. Is there any reason not to use this definition?","I am a complete beginner in measure theory and have only been reading Tao's notes on them for the past couple of days.

One can show that, when $E\subset [0,1]$ is a measurable set with finite perimeter, that  $$ P(E) = C \lim_{r\to 0^+} r^{-1}\|f_r\ast 1_E\|_{L^2}^2 $$ where the constant $C$ depends on the function $f$.  Here $1_E$ is the indicator function of $E$. To get intuition about this formula, observe that the convolution is zero deep in the interior or exterior of $E$, and only nonzero in a strip of width approximately $r$ on the boundary of $E$.  Thus the norm captures how much mass is near the boundary, in a smoothed way. My question is what happens when $E$ does not necessarily have finite perimeter. Is it true that $\lim_{r\to 0^+}r^{-1}\|f_r\ast 1_E\|_{L^2}^2 = \infty$ when $P(E) = \infty$? It turns out to be tricky, since we do not have a nice structure theorem for such sets, and in particular there does not have to exist a scale $r$ at which the behavior of the convolution ""settles"" into something understandable. A Reduction If $E\subset [0,1]$ has infinite perimeter, one can find disjoint intervals $I_1,\ldots,I_N$ in $[0,1]$ such that $0 < |I_k\cap E| < |I_k|$ for all $k$.  Throwing away at most half, we can assume that the intervals are separated (none share endpoints).  Since we can do this for any $N$ and using a simple rescaling argument, it suffices to prove the following statement: Does there exist a constant $c>0$ such that the following holds: For any measurable set $E\subset [0,1]$ with $0<|E|<1$,    $$ \lim_{r\to 0^+} r^{-1}\|f_r\ast E\|_{L^2}^2 > c?$$ If we want we can even assume above that $P(E) = \infty$, though I'm not sure whether that helps.  Notice that this is easy to prove when $E$ is also assumed to have finite perimeter, oddly the infinite perimeter case is what is difficult! A Potentially useful formula Expanding the convolution and the square, using the fact that $\int f = 0$, and applying a change of coordinates, one can show that  $$ r^{-1}\|f_r\ast 1_E\|_{L^2}^2 = -\frac{1}{2r}\int |E\Delta (E+rt)| g(t)\,dt $$ where  $$ g(t) = \int f(y) f(y+t)\,dy. $$ From the definition one has that $\max |g| = |g(0)| = \|f\|_{L^2}^2$, and  $\int g = 0$.  I can expand on the derivation of this formula if desired, though it is worth noting that the manipulations are largely the same as in this question I asked a few years ago which was motivated by the same problem. It is also possible to express this formula using the Fourier transform, but I haven't been able to get anything from this approach that is not already contained above.

Here is my attempt, with the questions in italics: To start, note that there is a closed subset $S$, of $\mathscr N\times \mathscr N\times X$ such that $\left \{ S_{\textbf{n}} \right \}_{\textbf{n}}$ constitutes the closed sets of $\mathscr N\times X.$ Furthermore, the map $\pi:(\textbf{m},\textbf{n},x)\mapsto (\textbf{m},x)$ is continuous so its image is analytic because $\mathscr N\times \mathscr N\times X$ is Polish. Let $A$ be the image of this map and consider the sections $A_{\bf m}.$ We can define the projection $\pi_1:S_{\textbf{m}}\to A_{\bf m}$ by $(\textbf{n},x)\mapsto x$ so that each $A_{\textbf{m}}$ is the projection from $\mathscr N\times X$ of the closed set $S_{\textbf{m}}$ and therefore is analytic. On the other hand, if $A'$ is analytic, then it is the projection of some closed set in $\mathscr N\times X$, which in turn,  must be one of the $S_{\bf m}.$ This proves the claim in the hint.

How do I see that $E - \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} E_n$ is of measure zero? My thoughts on the problem so far are as follows. Assume the contrary. To get a contradiction, apply Vitali's covering technique to points $x$ of $E - \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} E_n$ where $f'(x) > \alpha$ for some appropriate $\alpha > 0$ in order to construct disjoint open intervals $(x, x + r)$ with$${{f(x + r) - f(x)}\over r} > \alpha$$and$${{f_n(x + r) - f_n(x)}\over r} < \beta$$for $n \le N$ for some appropriate $\beta > 0$ and some appropriate $N \in \mathbb{N}$. However, I need some help with carrying this out and filling the details. Is it possible someone out there can help me fill in the details?",,"['calculus', 'real-analysis']"

I sort of ignored it, not knowing what to do with it. Is the statement even through without supposing continuity everywhere (that is taking $a = -\infty, b = +\infty$)? Proof: We must show that Dini function $D^+(F)(x) = \lim_{\delta \to 0} \sup_{0<h<\delta} \frac{F(x+h) - F(x)}{h} = \lim_{n\to\infty} \sup_{0<h<\frac{1}{n}} \frac{F(x+h) - F(x)}{h}$ is a measurable. In particular then, we are done if we show that $\forall \delta > 0$, $\sup_{0<h<\delta} \frac{F(x+h) - F(x)}{h}$ is measurable. Suppose therefore for arbitrary $\delta > 0$ and $\alpha$ that $x_0 \in F_{\delta, \alpha} = \{x : \sup_{0<h<\delta} \frac{F(x+h) - F(x)}{h} > \alpha\}$, we show that there exists some ball containing $x_0$ that is entirely contained in $F_{\delta, \alpha}$, then $F_{\delta, \alpha}$ is open and hence measurable, and we are done. For $x_0$ we have some $h_0 < \delta$ such that $\frac{F(x_0+h_0) - F(x_0)}{h_0} > \alpha$. Now consider the open interval $O = \{x : |x| < \delta_O\}$, by continuity taking $\delta_O$ small enough we have for any $\epsilon > 0$, however small, $\forall o \in O$ simultaneously that $F(x_0+o+h_0)-F(x_0+h_0) > -\epsilon/2$ and $F(x_0+o)-F(x_0) < \epsilon/2$, and therefore \begin{equation*} \begin{split}     &\frac{F(x_0+o+h_0) - F(x_0+o)}{h_0} \\     =& \frac{(F(x_0+o+h_0) - F(x_0+h_0)) + F(x_0+h_0) - (F(x_0+o) - F(x_0) + F(x_0))}{h_0} \\     >& -\epsilon/h_0 + \frac{F(x_0+h_0) - F(x_0)}{h_0} > \alpha \text{ when taking $\epsilon$ small enough} \end{split} \end{equation*} so that $x_0 + O$ is an open ball containing $x_0$ and being contained in $F_{\delta, \alpha}$. Thank-you so much for all the help!",,"['real-analysis', 'measure-theory', 'proof-verification']"
