1,Probability of a random cyclic quadrilateral enclosing a fixed point in its circle,Probability of a random cyclic quadrilateral enclosing a fixed point in its circle,,"I finally found a single integral solving the natural generalisation of the problem discussed here : For $n\ge1$ pick $n+2$ points uniformly at random on the unit circle. What is the probability $P_n(x)$ of the convex hull of the points containing $X=(x,0)$ where $0\le x\le1$ ? If the convex hull does not contain $X$ exactly one of the following cases must hold: All $n+2$ points are on the same side of the $x$ -axis ( $OX$ ). This happens with probability $2^{-(n+1)}$ . There is a point $V$ with Weierstrass parameter $v>0$ and another point $T$ with parameter $t<k/v$ where $k=\frac{x-1}{x+1}$ , and none of the remaining points' parameters are between $t$ and $v$ . All points thus lie ""left"" of the segment $TV$ which lies ""left"" of $X$ . The probability of a point falling in the arc $TV$ is $\frac{\arctan v-\arctan t}\pi$ , while $t,v$ are Cauchy-distributed and can be selected from the pool of points in $(n+2)(n+1)$ ways. This case's contribution to the overall probability is thus $$\frac{(n+2)(n+1)}{\pi^2}\int_0^\infty\int_{-\infty}^{k/v}\frac1{1+v^2}\frac1{1+t^2}\left(1-\frac{\arctan v-\arctan t}\pi\right)^n\,dt\,dv$$ There is a point $V$ with Weierstrass parameter $v>0$ and another point $T$ with parameter $k/v<t<0$ and all of the remaining points' parameters are between $t$ and $v$ , i.e. they are ""right"" of $TV$ which in turn is ""right"" of $X$ .

14,Distribution of midpoints in a unit disk,Distribution of midpoints in a unit disk,,"I'm trying to find a probability distribution $m(r,\theta)$ defined over a unit disk which represents the probability of a point being the midpoint of two randomly chosen points in said disk. I think that I'm pretty close to the answer, but I'm off by a factor of 16 and I don't understand why. Given that the distribution of points is uniform, i.e. $f(r,\theta) = \frac{1}{\pi}$ , my reasoning is as follows: The first and second points chosen are $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ respectively. If we fix the first point chosen inside the disk, the set of points which are possible midpoints for $P_{1}P_{2}$ form a disk of radius $\frac{1}{2}$ . (Edit: see the figure below for an illustration) Since for each possible $P_{1}$ there is a unique circle of size $\frac{\pi}{4}$ generated representing all the possible midpoints where $P_{1}$ is one of the points, then $m(r,\theta)$ should be proportional to the total ""height"" of all the unique circles that overlap onto the point $(r,\theta)$ , if we imagine each of the radius- $\frac{1}{2}$ circles as having some infinitesimal ""height"". I found the ""height"" of the overlapping circles to be $2(\frac{\arccos{r}}{4}-\frac{r}{2}\sqrt{\frac{1}{4}-\frac{r^{2}}{4}}) = \frac{1}{2}(\arccos{r}-r\sqrt{1-r^{2}})$ . This is the area of overlap between two circles of size $\frac{\pi}{4}$ , reason being that since the center of the radius- $\frac{1}{2}$ disks we formed in step 2 will fall within a radius- $\frac{1}{2}$ disk that is concentric to the unit disk, then the set of radius- $\frac{1}{2}$ disks which do not overlap onto $(r,\theta)$ must be more than a distance of $\frac{1}{2}$ from this point. Hence, the set of radius- $\frac{1}{2}$ disks which do form the ""height"" at point $(r,\theta)$ will have centers within a distance of $\frac{1}{2}$ from the point, and this is the leaf-shaped area between two circles - essentially the expression above. I'm not sure whether this is the correct way to be thinking about the ""height"" at the point - or if ""height"" is even the right way to think about it - so I would appreciate if anyone can point out a more rigorous direction. Assuming step 3 is correct, then because $f(r,\theta) = \frac{1}{\pi}$ , then since we are choosing 2 points, we scale step 3 by $\frac{1}{\pi^{2}}$ . However, if we take this as $m(r,\theta)$ , then $\int_{0}^{1}\int_{0}^{2\pi}m(r,\theta)r d\theta dr = \frac{1}{16}$ . I'm not very well versed in geomtery and probability, so there is definitely something wrong with my logic. Can anyone point me to where the missing factor of 16 comes from, or whether my entire chain of logic is incorrect? Figure for step 1: We just need to show that the boundary of the set of possible midpoints forms a circle. Consider the diameter that goes through $P_{1}$ and the center of the circle. If $P_{2}$ is on either $D_{1}$ or $D_{2}$ , then the midpoint will be at $M_{1}$ or $M_{2}$ respectively. Consider if $P_{2}$ is anywhere else on the larger circle, let's say $A$ (any point on the circle will form the boundary case), then its midpoint we call $X$ . $M_{1}P_{1} = \frac{1}{2}D_{1}P_{1}, XP_{1} = \frac{1}{2}AP_{1}$ and $\angle{M_{1}P_{1}X} = \angle{D_{1}P_{1}A}$ , so $M_{1}P_{1}X$ and $D_{1}P_{1}A$ are similar triangles by a factor of $\frac{1}{2}$ . A similar argument can be applied for $D_{2}$ and $M_{2}$ . Hence we have that $D_{1}D_{2}A$ is similar to $M_{1}M_{2}X$ by a factor of $\frac{1}{2}$ . Since $D_{1}D_{2}A$ is a right triangle, so is $M_{1}M_{2}X$ , and as A varies, X will trace out a circle of radius $\frac{1}{2}$ . P.S. I am quite sure that other than the factor of 16, everything else should be correct, because this is part of a larger problem that I am solving, which I have shown to be correct assuming that the factor of 16 is there.","I'm trying to find a probability distribution defined over a unit disk which represents the probability of a point being the midpoint of two randomly chosen points in said disk.

I could not find any examples myself. But I believe there must exist some, otherwise I see no point in introducing the bounded difference concentration inequality. Definitions: Bounded difference property. We say that $f:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ satisfies the bounded difference property, if for all $k\in[n]$ there exists a $L_k\geq 0$ , such that for all $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$ and any $t\in\mathbb{R}$ it holds that $|f(x)-f(x+te_k)|\leq L_k$ . Here, $e_k\in\mathbb{R}^n$ is the $k$ -th unit vector. One can show that $f$ satisfies the bounded difference property, if and only if $\|f\|_\infty<+\infty$ . To be specific, if $f$ is bounded, using the triangular inequality, $$ |f(x)-f(x+te_k)|\leq 2\|f\|_\infty $$ On the other hand, suppose that $f$ satisfies the bounded difference inequality. Let $x^k:=(x_1,\ldots,x_k,0,\ldots,0)$ .

Hence, we can directly use a sub-gaussian tail bound. From (2.11) in Wainwright's ""High-Dimensional Statistics"", we get the following. Sub-gaussian concentration for bounded random variables. If there exist $a,b>0$ , such that $a<f(x)<b$ , then, for all $t>0$ : $$ \mathbb{P}\left[|f(X)-\mathbb{E}[f(X)]|\geq t\right]\leq 2\exp\left(-\frac{2t^2}{(b-a)^2}\right) $$","Question: Is there an example, where the bounded difference property gives better concentration than what we get from using the sub-gaussian bound?

To state the case for $n$ dice: If we have the sets $S_1, S_2, \dots, S_n$ of possible outcomes and we throw $n$ indistinguishable dice (with the same number of sides) simultaneously, what is the probability that each die is contained in different sets, that is, what is the probability that the first is contained in set $S_{i_1}$ , the second is contained in $S_{i_2}$ , the third in $S_{i_3}$ , $\dots$ and the $n$ -th in $S_{i_n}$ with $i_1 \neq i_2 \neq i_3 \neq \dots \neq i_n$ . An example for $n=2$ : When have 2 dice and two sets $A$ and $B$ being $\{ 1, 2, 4\}$ and $\{ 1, 2, 5\}$ , respectively. We will end up with the possibilities of $\{ 1,1 \}, \{ 2,2 \}$ which account for a $\frac{1}{36}$ probability each and $\{ 1,2 \}$ , $\{ 1,4 \}$ , $\{ 1,5 \}$ , $\{ 2,4 \}$ , $\{ 2,5 \}$ , $\{ 4,5 \}$ accounting for a $\frac{2}{36}$ probability each, for a total chance of $\frac{14}{36}=\frac{7}{18}$ . As @user2661923 correctly pointed out in the other question, you could also determine this by calculating $\frac{(2\times 3^2) - 2^2}{36} = \frac{14}{36} = \frac{7}{18}$ . Formula for $n=2$ : In general the chance for $n=2$ dice with sets $A$ and $B$ is: $$\frac{2! \# A \# B - \#(A\cap B)^2}{6^2}$$ .

Successful rolls in the game are determined by rolling $n$ number of dice and counting the number of dice that are greater than or equal to a certain value (some pre-determined threshold $x$ ; for instance, values could be between 1 through 6 from a six sided die). For example, suppose my threshold $x=3$ ; if I roll $10$ six sided die, what is the probability that $4$ dice would land on a $3$ or greater? Additionally, the game allows for a positive pool of modifiers to be applied on the dice after they are rolled, such that it can bring them over the determined threshold $x$ and have it count as a success. For example, suppose I roll three six sided die. Let $n_i$ represent the value of the die, and let $n_1=2$ , $n_2=3$ , and $n_3=6$ . Suppose I have a threshold of $x=4$ have a pool of $+3$ points to apply on any one of those die.

27,Challenge: a Bit-flipping Game,Challenge: a Bit-flipping Game,,"I was just thinking about brain teasers the other day and came up with this one that turned out to be more difficult than I was anticipating. Suppose we play a game where we start with a bit string of $l$ zeroes (in my example $l=8$ ), 00000000 At each step of the game, we choose a bit at random from the bit string and flip it, like 01000000 The game terminates whenever we return back to our initial state of all zeroes. My question is this: What is the (closed-form) expected value of the length of the game as a function of $l$ ? My (incomplete) approach: First, I found the answer for verification purposes by programming the game with a couple different values of $l$ in python, which gave me the hypothesis that the expected value should be $2^l$ . My formal proof for how this is the case is what I'm seeking. I started by conceptualizing the bit string differently, as a string of integers from $0$ to $l-1$ with a dividing line between them. On the LHS of the line would be the indices of 1 in the bit string and the RHS would be indices of 0 in the bit string. This would encode a state like this: $$ \texttt{10111000}\qquad \Longrightarrow \qquad \texttt{0234 | 1567} $$ Then, each iteration of the game is simply choosing one of these numbers at random, and putting it on the other side of the dividing line. If we call the set of integers on the LHS $L$ and those on the RHS $R$ , then the probability that the line moves left is $|L|\;/\;l$ and the probability that it moves right is $|R|\;/\;l$ . In this sense, we can sort of model the bit-flipping process as a one-dimensional random walk, terminating whenever the walker reaches the LHS, or $|L| = 0$ . This is why I consider the process to be a Martingale, even though the probability that the walker moves one direction or the other actually changes depending on where it is. That said, I don't actually know anything about Martingales other than that they are essentially random walks with a terminating condition (like gambling or w/e). I'm just not sure how to continue from here, can anyone solve this problem?","I was just thinking about brain teasers the other day and came up with this one that turned out to be more difficult than I was anticipating.

29,"How is calculated the frequency of a pair, a flush of 2 cards, a straight of 2 cards and a straight flush of 2 cards (52 cards, hand of 2, 3, 4, etc)?","How is calculated the frequency of a pair, a flush of 2 cards, a straight of 2 cards and a straight flush of 2 cards (52 cards, hand of 2, 3, 4, etc)?",,"Introduction Before starting, I would like to specify a few things: The deck has 52 cards. From 1 (Ace) to 10, J, Q, K, all in four different suits: spades, diamonds, club and hearts. I don't add jokers because that is far beyond my possibilities of calculations. For better precision, I won't use chance, instead I would use combinations or frequency / total possible combinations. This is based on poker, but it isn't exactly poker. I mean, for example, the frequency on a pair in 5-cards poker is $2860={13 \choose 1}{4 \choose 2}{12 \choose 3}{4 \choose 1}^3$ , this formula that can be found on Wikipedia already excludes the chance of having not two but three or four cards with the same rank (three or four of a kind) and also excludes the chance of a full house (three of a kind + pair). What I want to discover, is not the frequency of a pair, instead, is the frequency of having at least two cards of the same rank. I'm not using the rules of poker, so I don't want to remove from the frequency the combinations that are ""better"". For example, the hand Q Q Q J J, which normally would be a full house, for this calculation I want it to be included in the ""pair"" calculation, because if you have three Qs, that means that you have at least a pair of Q, same with the Js. What do I want? What I want to calculate is the frequency of drawing: At least two cards of the same rank (a pair). At least two cards of the same suit (a flush of 2). At least two consecutive cards (a straight of 2). At least two consecutive cards of the same suit (a straight of 2 flushed). All the previous frequencies I wanted to calculate them with: A 2-card hand. A 3-card hand. A 4-card hand. A 5-card hand. A 6-card hand. A 7-card hand. My Calculations Before starting to show my math I will show you how I got it. At wikipedia, the chance of a four of a kind if a 5-card deck is $642={13 \choose 1}{4 \choose 4}{12 \choose 1}{4 \choose 1}$ . I understand this as choose one of 13 ranks, then choose all four suits of that rank, for the last card choose one other rank and then one suit for that card. Then I tried to recreate the formula with different reasoning. $642={13 \choose 1}{4 \choose 4}{52-4 \choose 1}$ which I understand as choose one of 13 ranks, then choose all four suits of that rank, finally choose one card other than the four previously used . Below I will show you a table with my math.

Of course, a flush of 2 cards is allowed to get 100% if you draw 5 cards (it is impossible to get 5 different suits because there only exist 4 different); however, it should not reach 100% in a 4-card hand (an easy example would be drawing a spade, a club, a diamond and a heart, none is repeated). Question: What am I missing with my calculations? As my method of calculation of the extra cards after forming what I want (for example, the three cards remaining after having a pair using 5 cards) I used ${52-2 \choose 3}$ instead of what appears in Wikipedia, I made an experiment trying to get the same results of Wikipedia with my method. The frequency of three of a kind in Wikipedia is $54.912={13 \choose 1}{4 \choose 3}{12 \choose 2}{4 \choose 1}^2$ which I understand as choose one card of the 13 ranks, then choose three of the four suits for that card, finally choose 2 cards that aren't from the previous rank, these cards each can be of any suit . If I use ${13 \choose 1}{4 \choose 3}{52-4 \choose 2}=58.656$ I have to eliminate the frequency in which that two extra cards are a pair, because that would fall into Full House from normal poker (following Wikipedia), so $58.656-3.744=54.912$ which is fine. Now I go one step further. If I use ${13 \choose 1}{4 \choose 3}{52-3 \choose 2}=61.152$ I have to eliminate the frequency in which that two extra cards are a pair (because of full house), and the frequency in that the remaining card of the suit appears and transform my three of a kind into a four of a kind $61.152-3.744-624=56.784$ which isn't 54.912. I discovered that if I multiply (in the previous formula) the frequency of a full house by 1.5, or I multiply the frequency of a four of a kind by 4 I get exactly 54.912, but I'm not sure why, and that might be what makes my math surpass the 100% (when comparing the frequency/total possible combinations). Do you have any idea what I'm doing wrong? What would be considered an answer? An explanation of which mathematical expression I am understanding wrong, a correct expression to replace that part, an explanation of what means that suggested new expression and one example using any of the combinations that appear in my table above that surpass the 100% using that new suggested expression.

I just know combinations because at university we had 3 classes of hypergeometric distributions (I'm studying business administration). This is not for the university, work or gambling, actually, it is for Dungeons & Dragons 5e.","Introduction Before starting, I would like to specify a few things: The deck has 52 cards. From 1 (Ace) to 10, J, Q, K, all in four different suits: spades, diamonds, club and hearts. I don't add jokers because that is far beyond my possibilities of calculations. For better precision, I won't use chance, instead I would use combinations or frequency / total possible combinations. This is based on poker, but it isn't exactly poker. I mean, for example, the frequency on a pair in 5-cards poker is , this formula that can be found on Wikipedia already excludes the chance of having not two but three or four cards with the same rank (three or four of a kind) and also excludes the chance of a full house (three of a kind + pair). What I want to discover, is not the frequency of a pair, instead, is the frequency of having at least two cards of the same rank. I'm not using the rules of poker, so I don't want to remove from the frequency the combinations that are ""better"". For example, the hand Q Q Q J J, which normally would be a full house, for this calculation I want it to be included in the ""pair"" calculation, because if you have three Qs, that means that you have at least a pair of Q, same with the Js. What do I want? What I want to calculate is the frequency of drawing: At least two cards of the same rank (a pair). At least two cards of the same suit (a flush of 2). At least two consecutive cards (a straight of 2). At least two consecutive cards of the same suit (a straight of 2 flushed). All the previous frequencies I wanted to calculate them with: A 2-card hand. A 3-card hand. A 4-card hand. A 5-card hand. A 6-card hand. A 7-card hand. My Calculations Before starting to show my math I will show you how I got it. At wikipedia, the chance of a four of a kind if a 5-card deck is . I understand this as choose one of 13 ranks, then choose all four suits of that rank, for the last card choose one other rank and then one suit for that card. Then I tried to recreate the formula with different reasoning. which I understand as choose one of 13 ranks, then choose all four suits of that rank, finally choose one card other than the four previously used . Below I will show you a table with my math. Hand 2 cards 3 cards 4 cards 5 cards 6 cards 7 cards Total combinations Pair Flush of 2 Straight of 2 Straight of 2 flushed* *At 12 cards while the total number is My problem is that as you can see, when you draw multiple hands, the combinations of for example a pair becomes higher than the total possible combination, a thing that is absurd and can be easily demonstrated with an example hand: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, there are 7 different cards, none is a pair. Of course, a flush of 2 cards is allowed to get 100% if you draw 5 cards (it is impossible to get 5 different suits because there only exist 4 different); however, it should not reach 100% in a 4-card hand (an easy example would be drawing a spade, a club, a diamond and a heart, none is repeated). Question: What am I missing with my calculations? As my method of calculation of the extra cards after forming what I want (for example, the three cards remaining after having a pair using 5 cards) I used instead of what appears in Wikipedia, I made an experiment trying to get the same results of Wikipedia with my method. The frequency of three of a kind in Wikipedia is which I understand as choose one card of the 13 ranks, then choose three of the four suits for that card, finally choose 2 cards that aren't from the previous rank, these cards each can be of any suit . If I use I have to eliminate the frequency in which that two extra cards are a pair, because that would fall into Full House from normal poker (following Wikipedia), so which is fine. Now I go one step further. If I use I have to eliminate the frequency in which that two extra cards are a pair (because of full house), and the frequency in that the remaining card of the suit appears and transform my three of a kind into a four of a kind which isn't 54.912. I discovered that if I multiply (in the previous formula) the frequency of a full house by 1.5, or I multiply the frequency of a four of a kind by 4 I get exactly 54.912, but I'm not sure why, and that might be what makes my math surpass the 100% (when comparing the frequency/total possible combinations). Do you have any idea what I'm doing wrong? What would be considered an answer? An explanation of which mathematical expression I am understanding wrong, a correct expression to replace that part, an explanation of what means that suggested new expression and one example using any of the combinations that appear in my table above that surpass the 100% using that new suggested expression. For example: ""When you say this expression ... you are wrong because that means instead ... What you have to use is ... because that means ... For example, if we use this formula to get the frequency of a pair with a 7-cards hand (in which your math surpassed 100%), we get ... which is correct because ...""

34,Minimize the expected value of the product of 2 normally distributed variables,Minimize the expected value of the product of 2 normally distributed variables,,"So, there are 2 variables, $X$ and $Y$ , both are normally distributed.

Odds all objects are selected?,Combinatorics question: N people selecting k objects (without replacement) from field of K total objects. Odds all objects are selected?,,"Title is a bit verbose so here's a scenario: Suppose 4 friends go out to a restaurant, and each of them will order 3 items from a total list of 9 items. Each item ordered by a single person is different. If each person's selection of items is completely random, what is the probability that between the 4 friends, all 9 items on the menu are sampled at least once? This type of problem would be simmed pretty easily, but I am very interested in the theoretical method that would be used to arrive at the answer. Here's what I think so far: If each person has (9 choose 3) item combinations (orders), then the total number of order combinations should be ((9 choose 3) ^ 4) / (4!) (since we don't care about who orders what, just that all items are covered). So all that's left is to quantify those order combinations in which every item is covered, and then divide by that total. However, this is where I'm stuck. It has occurred to me that one way to solve this would be to just add up all of the possible ways for the scenario to succeed. If the items are numbered 1-9 and each {} represents an order, this would look like: P({1,2,3}, {1,2,3}, {4,5,6}, {7,8,9}) + P({1,2,3},{3,4,5},{5,6,7},{7,8,9}) + ... But that type of breakdown seems like a nightmare especially at higher numbers. It feels like there should be a way to make clever use of a choose function for a relatively neat solution. Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I appreciate any help that may be offered toward finding a solution. Edit: After mulling this over, I think this can actually be solved with just straight probability without even worrying about the # of combinations. The probability that all items are covered would be 1 - the sum of 1 item, 2 items... 6 items not covered = 1 - Sum(i = 1 to i = 6) {((9-i) (8-i) (7-i)/(9x8x7))^4}. Doing that yields 76.8909%, which seems like a reasonable outcome (I haven't checked this for correctness).

43,A drunkard flipping switches in a dark room,A drunkard flipping switches in a dark room,,"There are $n$ switches in a dark room controlling a single light; all the switches must be on for the light to be on.

I may use the fact that the expected number of tosses until the first $\displaystyle H$ is $\displaystyle \frac{1}{p}$ . My solution: Let's denote $\displaystyle X_{2} =number\ of\ tosses\ until\ HH\ ( including\ the\ HH)$ . We want to find $\displaystyle E[ X_{2}]$ . At the same time, let's denote $\displaystyle X_{1} =number\ of\ tosses\ until\ H\ ( including\ H)$ . From the given we know that $\displaystyle E[ X_{1}] =\frac{1}{p}$ . Let's now try to simplify the expression $\displaystyle E[ X_{2}]$ with the Law of Total Probability. Let's denote two events: $\displaystyle A=after\ the\ 1^{st} \ H\ appears,\ the\ next\ toss\ is\ an\ H$ . $\displaystyle A^{c} =after\ the\ 1^{st} \ H\ appears,\ the\ next\ toss\ is\ a\ T$ . Let's also assume that the number of tosses until the first $\displaystyle H$ is some number $\displaystyle r$ . Since every toss is independent from each other, we know that $\displaystyle P( A) =P( H) =p$ . At the same, from the same reason, we will get $\displaystyle P\left( A^{c}\right) =P( T) =1-p$ . From the \ Law of Total Probability then, we can define: $\displaystyle E[ X_{2}] =P( A) \cdotp E[ X|A] +P\left( A^{c}\right) \cdotp E\left[ X|A^{c}\right]$ . $\displaystyle =p\cdotp E[ X|A] +( 1-p) \cdotp E\left[ X|A^{c}\right]$ . But, • $\displaystyle E[ X|A]$ = the expected number of tosses until the first HH, if we know that we had exactly $\displaystyle r$ tosses until the first $\displaystyle H$ , and after that we had an $\displaystyle H$ . Basically, this means we received $\displaystyle HH$ consecutively for the first time! So we will stop tossing here. The number of tosses, in this case, will be is $\displaystyle r+1$ . We know the expected value of $\displaystyle r$ is $\displaystyle E[ X_{1}] =\frac{1}{p}$ . So: $\displaystyle E[ X|A] =\frac{1}{p} +1$ . • $\displaystyle E\left[ X|A^{c}\right]$ = the expected number of tosses, if we know that we had exaclty $\displaystyle r$ tosses until the first $\displaystyle H$ , and after that we had a $\displaystyle T$ . Also, in this case, we tossed the coin $\displaystyle r+1$ times, but we won't be stopping, since we didn't achieve the $\displaystyle HH$ consecutively. The opposite, we are left facing the same problem recursively. Each toss is independent from the previous one, so after the $\displaystyle r+1$ , we have to ""start over"", and have again $\displaystyle E[ X_{2}]$ expected tosses. So: $\displaystyle E\left[ X|A^{c}\right] =\frac{1}{p} +1+E[ X_{2}]$ . Overall plugging into our initial equation we get: $\displaystyle  \begin{array}{{>{\displaystyle}l}} E[ X_{2}] =p\cdotp \left(\frac{1}{p} +1\right) +( 1-p) \cdotp \left(\frac{1}{p} +1+E[ X_{2}]\right)\\ =1+p+\frac{1}{p} +1+E[ X_{2}] -1-p\cdotp E[ X_{2}]\\ \Rightarrow \\ p\cdotp E[ X_{2}] =\frac{1}{p} +1\\ \Rightarrow \\ E[ X_{2}] =\frac{1+p}{p^{2}} . \end{array}$ I'm confident this solution is correct, by looking at this other question: Expected value of number of trials to get k SUCCESSIVE successes .

61,Classic Hat Probability Problem,Classic Hat Probability Problem,,"This is a textbook example and I am confused about the explanation. This question was asked by different people in stack-exchange already but I couldn't find the solution to my question. Here's the problem: At a party $n$ man take their hats. The hats are then mixed up and each man randomly selects one. We say that a match occurs if a man selects his own hat. What is the probability of no matches? What is the probability of exactly $k$ matches? Solution (summarized): $P_n = P(E) =$ the event that no matches occur, dependence on $n$ , $M =$ first man selects his own hat $M^c=$ first man does not select his own hat So, $P_n = P(E) = P(E|M)P(M) + P(E|M^c)P(M^c)$ Since $P(E|M) = 0$ , we get $P(E)=P(E|M^c)* \frac{n-1}{n}$ Here's my question: the solution says $P(E|M^c)$ is the probability of no matches when $(n−1)$ men select from a set of $n − 1$ hats that does not contain the hat of one of these men. This can happen in either of two mutually exclusive ways. Either there are no matches and the extra man does not select the extra hat (this being the hat of the man that chose first), or there are no matches and the extra man does select the extra hat.

This question was asked by different people in stack-exchange already but I couldn't find the solution to my question. Here's the problem: At a party man take their hats. The hats are then mixed up and each man randomly selects one. We say that a match occurs if a man selects his own hat. What is the probability of no matches? What is the probability of exactly matches? Solution (summarized): the event that no matches occur, dependence on , first man selects his own hat first man does not select his own hat So, Since , we get Here's my question: the solution says is the probability of no matches when men select from a set of hats that does not contain the hat of one of these men.

82,Symmetric random walk passes through 1,Symmetric random walk passes through 1,,"I am working on the following problem (which I couldn't find on the website so far): Show that a symmetric random walk ($1$ dimensional) starting from the origin visits the point $1$ with probability $1$. My attempt so far (an adaptation of the recurrence proof from Probability An Introduction $2^{nd}$ edition by Grimmett and Welsh -p.170). Let $S_n$ be the r.v. which represents where (on the $X$-axis) the random walk is at time $n$. And let $X_n$ be the random variable representing the move that has happened at time $n$. Of course, $X_i=\pm1$ and $$ P(X_i=1) = P(X_i=-1)=\frac{1}{2} \mbox{ as it is symmetric} $$ Hence, we can write $S_n = X_1 + \dots + X_n$. In order to be at point $1$ we would need to have had an odd number of moves ($m+1$ to the right and $m$ to the left). Hence we cannot be at point $1$ after an even number of moves. Hence, $$ P(S_{2m}=1) = 0, \mbox{  } m\geq0 \tag{1} $$ and  $$ P(S_{2m+1} = 1) = \binom{2m+1}{m}\frac{1}{2^{2m+1}}, \mbox{ } m\geq0 \tag{2} $$ Let, now, $A_n = \left \{ S_n = 1\right \}$ for the event that the walk visits point $1$ at time $n$, and: $$ B_n = \left\{ S_n = 1, S_k\neq1 \mbox{ for } 1\leq k\leq n-1 \right\} $$ for the event that the first visit of the walk through point $1$ occurs at time $n$. If $A_n$ occurs, then exactly one of $B_1, \dots , B_n$ occurs, giving that: $$ P(A_n) = \sum_{k=1}^{n}P(A_n\cap B_k). $$ Now, $A_n\cap B_k$ is the event that the walk goes through $1$ for the first time at time $k$ and then again in another $n-k$ steps. Hence: $$ P(A_n\cap B_k) = P(B_k)P(A_{n-k}), \mbox{for } 2\leq k \leq n \tag{3} $$ I have doubts that in the equation above, the boundaries are correct i.e. not sure if $n\geq 2$ since transitions in disjoint intervals of time are independent of each other. We write $f_n = P(B_n)$ and $u_n = P(A_n)$. Hence, from the above equations we get that: $$ u_n = \sum_{k=2}^{n} f_{k}u_{n-k}, \mbox{ for } n=1,2,\dots $$ We know the $u_i$s from $(1)$ and $(2)$ and we want to find the $f_k$. Given that the summation we got above is a convolution, we can use probability generating functions.  $$ U(s) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}u_ns^n $$ $$ F(s) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}f_ns^n $$ noting that $u_0 = 0$ and $f_0 = 0$, we have, from $(3)$ that: $$ \sum_{n=2}^{\infty}u_ns^n = F(s)U(s) $$  Hence $U(s) - \frac{1}{2}s = F(s)U(s)$. Hence  $$F(s) = 1 - \frac{1}{2sU(s)} $$ And we can find out (not so easily), that: $$ U(s) = \frac{1-\sqrt{1-s^2}}{s\sqrt{1-s^2}}, |s|<1  $$ Hence,  $$ F(s) = 1-\frac{s\sqrt{1-s^2}}{2s-2s\sqrt{1-s^2}}, |s|<1  $$ We get the probability we are interested in by taking the limit in the above equation as $s\to 1$, which yields $1$.

Doesn't read a magazine at all Reads A but not B Reads only one magazine. So, in this example the events were labelled : A = {Probability that this person reads A} B = {Probability that this person reads B} C = {Probability that this person reads C} If this were an exercise, I might have started by naming the probability event according to the question so : X = {Probability that this person read's A or C} Y = {Probability that this person doesn't read a magazine} etc.. or something like that.

The act of taking out his book, finding the answer and putting his book back in his bag takes $1$ minute. The student wants to make sure that the probability of not getting caught is at least $99.9\%$. Consider the student caught when some part of the $30$ secondes overlap with some part of the $1$ minute. Note: the student doesn't know whether the teacher is in the classroom, so it is possible that he takes out his book while the teacher is already present. How many times can the student takes out his book while maintaining a $99.9\%$ chance (minimum) of not getting caught?

He randomly enters the classroom $3$ times. Each time he spends $30$ seconds before he leaves again. One of the student figures he can cheat by looking up the answers in his book. The act of taking out his book, finding the answer and putting his book back in his bag takes $1$ minute. The student wants to make sure that the probability of not getting caught is at least $99.9\%$. Consider the student caught when some part of the $30$ secondes overlap with some part of the $1$ minute. Note: the student doesn't know whether the teacher is in the classroom, so it is possible that he takes out his book while the teacher is already present. How many times can the student takes out his book while maintaining a $99.9\%$ chance (minimum) of not getting caught?

99,What's the probability of guessing a secret code if the attempts are limited and you stop at the first success?,What's the probability of guessing a secret code if the attempts are limited and you stop at the first success?,,"Some time ago I tried to answer a question on Security Stack Exchange, but I realised I'm not sure I got the maths right, and I'm here to ask for help. The scenario is as follows: somebody is trying to break into another user's account. That account is protected by a password and by a so-called ""second factor"" (like a code sent vis SMS, or generated by an app like Google Authenticator), and the hypothesis is that the attacker knows the password, so the only protection is given by this code. If it is a 3-digit code, there are 1000 possible codes, and with a single attempt the probability to guess it is $p = \frac{1}{1000}$. This is easy. The point where I'm stuck at is calculating the probability of guessing the right code if he has more than one attempt. For example, he can try at most 3 times, and after that the account is locked for protection, and it's game over. What's the probability of success, in that case? Here's what I tried. First of all, we have to establish whether the correct code is the same for all three attempts, or whether it changes every time. I've explored both cases. Case A: the code is always the same. I think this can be modelled with a hypergeometric variable. As Wikipedia says, it's ""the probability of k successes in n draws, without replacement, from a finite population of size N that contains exactly K successes, wherein each draw is either a success or a failure"". In our case, with N = 1000, K = 1, n = 3, k = 1, it's $$ \require{cancel} P_{Code\,is\,guessed} = \frac{\binom{1}{1} \binom{1000-1}{3-1}}{\binom{1000}{3}} = \frac{\binom{999}{2}}{\binom{1000}{3}} = \frac{\frac{999!}{2!\cdot\cancel{997!}}}{\frac{1000!}{3!\cdot\cancel{997!}}} = \frac{\frac{\cancel{999!}}{\cancel{2}}}{\frac{1000\cdot\cancel{999!}}{3\cdot\cancel{2}\cdot1}} = \frac{3}{1000} $$ To confirm this, I've drawn a tree of the possible outcomes: at every node there's a guess. The green branch corresponds to guessing the right code, the red branch to not guessing it and proceeding to the next attempt (unless it's the last one): The probability of ending up at a certain leaf is the product of all the probabilities of the intermediate nodes, and the probability of reaching any of the ""green"" leaves is simply the sum, as they are independent events. Therefore, $$ P_{Code\,is\,guessed} = \frac{1}{1000} + (\frac{\cancel{999}}{1000} \cdot \frac{1}{\cancel{999}}) + (\frac{\cancel{999}}{1000} \cdot \frac{\cancel{998}}{\cancel{999}} \cdot \frac{1}{\cancel{998}}) = \frac{1}{1000} + \frac{1}{1000} + \frac{1}{1000} = \frac{3}{1000} $$ This looks good, because it's the same result. I'm fairly confident it's correct. Is it right? Case B: the code changes every time I tried to apply the same reasoning to the case where the code changes at every failed attempt. Intuitively, the fact that the code changes every time means that for his second attempt the attacker can't restrict the range to 999 possible codes, but he has to consider, again, 1000. I think this corresponds to a binomial distribution where he tries to have k = 1 successes in n = 3 attempts, but I already have my doubts: if we guess the right code, we immediately stop, but I think the binomial assumes that we make 3 attempts in any case, that is, even if we guess the right code at the first attempt, the binomial assumes we try (and fail) 2 more times. Anyway, with $p=\frac{1}{1000}$, n=3, k=1, the probability is $$ P_{Code\,is\,guessed} = \binom{n}{k} \cdot p^k \cdot (1-p)^{(n-k)} = \binom{3}{1} \cdot \frac{1}{1000} \cdot (\frac{999}{1000})^{(3-1)} = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{1000} \cdot (\frac{999}{1000})^2 = 0.002994003 $$ Again, to confirm the result I tried building the tree: And in this case, $$ P_{Code\,is\,guessed} = \frac{1}{1000} + \frac{999}{1000} \cdot \frac{1}{1000}  + (\frac{999}{1000})^2 \cdot \frac{1}{1000} = 0.002997001 $$ which is different from the previous result, the one that I got using the binomial! This means at least one of these calculations is wrong (and possibly both), but I'm not sure where the error is. Anyway the tree convinces me more, and as I said I suspect that the problem is that the binomial isn't the right choice here, because it assumes that the attacker always makes 3 attempts, and this is not realistic in this scenario. So, these are my questions: Are my calculations correct for case A (the code is always the same)? For case B, I'm sure there's an error. Where is it? I even tried simplifying the problem to rolling a die trying to get a certain face, and if the result is not the desired one, rolling one more time. I think the trick might be that if the first roll is successful we don't have to add the probability of guessing at the second roll, because there simply won't be a second roll. But, again, I'm confused.","Some time ago I tried to answer a question on Security Stack Exchange, but I realised I'm not sure I got the maths right, and I'm here to ask for help.

First of all, we have to establish whether the correct code is the same for all three attempts, or whether it changes every time. I've explored both cases. Case A: the code is always the same. I think this can be modelled with a hypergeometric variable. As Wikipedia says, it's ""the probability of k successes in n draws, without replacement, from a finite population of size N that contains exactly K successes, wherein each draw is either a success or a failure"". In our case, with N = 1000, K = 1, n = 3, k = 1, it's $$ \require{cancel} P_{Code\,is\,guessed} = \frac{\binom{1}{1} \binom{1000-1}{3-1}}{\binom{1000}{3}} = \frac{\binom{999}{2}}{\binom{1000}{3}} = \frac{\frac{999!}{2!\cdot\cancel{997!}}}{\frac{1000!}{3!\cdot\cancel{997!}}} = \frac{\frac{\cancel{999!}}{\cancel{2}}}{\frac{1000\cdot\cancel{999!}}{3\cdot\cancel{2}\cdot1}} = \frac{3}{1000} $$ To confirm this, I've drawn a tree of the possible outcomes: at every node there's a guess. The green branch corresponds to guessing the right code, the red branch to not guessing it and proceeding to the next attempt (unless it's the last one): The probability of ending up at a certain leaf is the product of all the probabilities of the intermediate nodes, and the probability of reaching any of the ""green"" leaves is simply the sum, as they are independent events. Therefore, $$ P_{Code\,is\,guessed} = \frac{1}{1000} + (\frac{\cancel{999}}{1000} \cdot \frac{1}{\cancel{999}}) + (\frac{\cancel{999}}{1000} \cdot \frac{\cancel{998}}{\cancel{999}} \cdot \frac{1}{\cancel{998}}) = \frac{1}{1000} + \frac{1}{1000} + \frac{1}{1000} = \frac{3}{1000} $$ This looks good, because it's the same result. I'm fairly confident it's correct. Is it right? Case B: the code changes every time I tried to apply the same reasoning to the case where the code changes at every failed attempt. Intuitively, the fact that the code changes every time means that for his second attempt the attacker can't restrict the range to 999 possible codes, but he has to consider, again, 1000. I think this corresponds to a binomial distribution where he tries to have k = 1 successes in n = 3 attempts, but I already have my doubts: if we guess the right code, we immediately stop, but I think the binomial assumes that we make 3 attempts in any case, that is, even if we guess the right code at the first attempt, the binomial assumes we try (and fail) 2 more times. Anyway, with $p=\frac{1}{1000}$, n=3, k=1, the probability is $$ P_{Code\,is\,guessed} = \binom{n}{k} \cdot p^k \cdot (1-p)^{(n-k)} = \binom{3}{1} \cdot \frac{1}{1000} \cdot (\frac{999}{1000})^{(3-1)} = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{1000} \cdot (\frac{999}{1000})^2 = 0.002994003 $$ Again, to confirm the result I tried building the tree: And in this case, $$ P_{Code\,is\,guessed} = \frac{1}{1000} + \frac{999}{1000} \cdot \frac{1}{1000}  + (\frac{999}{1000})^2 \cdot \frac{1}{1000} = 0.002997001 $$ which is different from the previous result, the one that I got using the binomial! This means at least one of these calculations is wrong (and possibly both), but I'm not sure where the error is. Anyway the tree convinces me more, and as I said I suspect that the problem is that the binomial isn't the right choice here, because it assumes that the attacker always makes 3 attempts, and this is not realistic in this scenario. So, these are my questions: Are my calculations correct for case A (the code is always the same)? For case B, I'm sure there's an error. Where is it? I even tried simplifying the problem to rolling a die trying to get a certain face, and if the result is not the desired one, rolling one more time. I think the trick might be that if the first roll is successful we don't have to add the probability of guessing at the second roll, because there simply won't be a second roll. But, again, I'm confused.",,"['probability', 'probability-distributions', 'binomial-distribution']"
