Suppose $\xi_0$ is a totally geodesic submanifold of $G/H$ , and let $H_0 = \left\lbrace g \in G | g \cdot \xi_0 = \xi_0 \right\rbrace$ be its isotropy group. Can we say that $H_0$ acts transitively on $\xi_0$ ? It seems to be true in simple cases of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbb{S}^n$ . In the first case, $G$ is the group of rigid motions characterized by the matrices of the type $\left[ \begin{matrix} A & b \\ 0& 1 \end{matrix} \right]$ , where $A \in O(n)$ and $b \in \mathbb{R}^n$ , with the action given by $\left[ \begin{matrix} A & b \\ 0& 1 \end{matrix} \right] \cdot x = Ax + b$ , for $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ . Here, if I consider $\mathbb{R}^{n - 1}$ as a totally geodesic submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^n$ , we get its isotropy group to be $$H_0 = \left\lbrace \left[ \begin{matrix} A & 0 & b \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{matrix} \right] : A \in SO(n-1) \text{ and } b \in \mathbb{R}^{n - 1} \right\rbrace \cup \left\lbrace \left[ \begin{matrix} A & 0 & b \\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{matrix} \right] : A \in O^{-}(n-1) \text{ and } b \in \mathbb{R}^{n - 1} \right\rbrace,$$ where $O^{-}(n-1)$ is the set of all orthogonal matrices with determinant negative. From this characterization, it is easy to see that $H_0$ does act transitively on $\xi_0$ (through translations alone!). Similar computations can be done for the case of $\mathbb{S}^n$ , where the totally geodesic submanifolds are lower dimensional spheres. Now, I want to generalize this to arbitrary Riemannian homogeneous manifolds (that need not be embedded in any Euclidean space, like $\mathbb{S}^n$ ). I have an intuition that this should be true.

He first introduces the concept of an affine connection $\nabla$ , which is basically a covariant derivative on vector fields, so if we have vector fields $X, Y$ , it tells us how to calculate $\nabla_X Y$ , i.e., how $Y$ changes as we move in the $X$ direction, at each point. If we have the basis $(\partial_i) = (\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i})$ for a smooth chart $(U, x)$ , then exactly what the connection does is defined in terms of the Christoffel symbols: $\nabla_{\partial_i} \partial_j = \Gamma_{ij}^k \partial_k$ This all makes sense to me. Then, from what I understand, if we want to transport a vector from the tangent plane at one point to another, we could do some sort of integration of that derivative over the path taken, and that would give the final vector. He then introduces (section 3) the concept of a conjugate connection $\nabla^\ast$ that's conjugate to a given connection $\nabla$ .

This is somewhat complicated by the fact that (like I asked about in my previous question ) his dual basis isn't the covector dual basis $dx_i$ I'm used to from earlier differential geometry, it's the dual (covector) basis with the ""sharp"" operator applied to it, making it a vector again, such that we have two ways of expressing the same vector .

An $n$ - dimensional smooth atlas on $M$ is a collection of maps $$\mathcal A = \left\{ \left(\varphi_i, U_i\right) \mid i\in A\right\}, \quad \varphi_i: U_i\rightarrow \varphi_i(U_i)\subset \mathbb R^n,$$ such that all $U_i \subset M$ are open, all $\varphi_i$ are homeomorphisms, and $\{U_i, i\in I\}$ is an open covering of $\mathcal M$ $\varphi_i\circ \varphi_j^{-1}: \varphi_j\left(U_i\cap U_j\right)\rightarrow \varphi_i\left( U_i\cap U_j\right)$ are smooth for all $i, j\in I$ . Now, this thread gives the following ""recipe"" for constructing non-equivalent atlases: Here is a very easy way to construct inequivalent atlases on the same differentiable manifold $X$ , e.g. $X=\mathbb{R}$ or $X=\mathbb{S}^1$ . Pick any homeomorphism $f : X \to X$ which is not a diffeomorphism (one always exists). For each chart in the given atlas $(U,\phi)$ , define a chart $(f^{-1}(U),\phi \circ f)$ in the new atlas. The overlap condition holds between charts in this new atlas because the $f$ 's cancel out. But an overlap between a chart in the new atlas and one in the old is not smooth, because the $f$ does not cancel out and it would follow that $f$ is smooth which it isn't. Question : Why exactly cannot $f$ be a diffeomorphism? Or to ask it differently: For example, let's assume that $f$ is ""only"" a $C^{1}$ diffeomorphism, wouldn't the recipe still hold, because a $C^{1}$ diffeomorphism is in general not smooth, i.e. $C^{∞}$ ? EDIT : This is the definition of smoothness that we had for a map $f$ between two smooth manifolds: Let $M$ and $N$ be two smooth manifolds. A continuous map $f:M\to N$ is called smooth if for all charts $(\varphi, U)$ of $M$ , $(\psi, V)$ of $N$ , $$\psi\circ f\circ \varphi^{-1}: \varphi(U\cap f^{-1}(V)) \to \psi(V)$$ is smooth.

I don't think so for the following reason: $$h^{-1}(\phi_{\alpha}^{-1}(U_{\alpha})) = h^{-1}(\{x\in U_{\alpha}\mid \phi_{\alpha}(x)\in U_{\alpha}\}) = \{y\in B_{1}(0) \mid h(y)\in\{x\in U_{\alpha}\mid \phi_{\alpha}(x)\in U_{\alpha}\}\}.$$ And here comes my problem : We know that $h: B_{1}(0)\to B_{1}(0)$ , so how can $h(y)$ be an element of the set $\{x\in U_{\alpha}\mid \dots\}$ , which is a subset of $U_{\alpha}$ ?

97,smooth vector fields over the 2-sphere is not a free module,smooth vector fields over the 2-sphere is not a free module,,"I keep seeing that the hairy ball theorem implies that smooth vector fields over $S^2$ are not a free module is implied by the hairy ball theorem; I don't understand how. How do I fill in the gaps? The hairy ball theorem tells us that we cannot have a smooth nonvanishing vector field over $S^2$ . For contradiction, assume that $\mathfrak X(S^2)$ is a free module over the ring $C^\infty (S^2)$ . Thus, $\mathfrak X(S^2) \simeq \oplus_i C^\infty(S^2)$ , since a free module is isomorphic to a direct sum of copies the ring. I am unsure how to continue. I have some ideas: First, see that we need at least two copies of $C^\infty(S^2)$ , because the sphere locally looks like $\mathbb R^2$ . If we have exactly two basis vector fields $V_1, V_2$ , then these must both vanish at points $p_1$ , $p_2$ by the hairy ball theorem. Consider the neighbourhood of $p_1$ : since $v_1$ vanishes, we have only one vector field $V_2$ which is not sufficient to locally span $\mathbb R^2$ . If we have three vector fields, we can have $V_{1, 2, 3}$ vanish at distinct $p_{1 2, 3}$ thereby leaving two vector fields even when one of them vanishes. However, now we can pick a point where none of $V_{1, 2, 3}$ vanish. (Why does such a point exist?). At this point, locally, we have three degrees of freedom $V_{1, 2, 3}$ , but the vector space looks like $\mathbb R^2$ so they cannot be linearly independent. Unfortunately, as is obvious from the above, I have no idea how to make this rigorous. I would appreciate whether this proof is repairable, and if now, how does one actually prove that smooth vector fields over $S^2$ are not  free module?","I keep seeing that the hairy ball theorem implies that smooth vector fields over are not a free module is implied by the hairy ball theorem; I don't understand how.
