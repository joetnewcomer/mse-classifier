In general $a_N<\frac{1}{N}$, as Michael Hardy notes; we can write this as $\limsup(Na_N)<1$.  This is a consequence of the pigeonhole principle and known as Dirichlet's theorem in Diophantine approximation. For algebraic irrational $\alpha$, Roth's theorem tells us that for every $\epsilon>0$ and any $N>N(\epsilon,\alpha)$, $$a_N > C_\epsilon N^{-1-\epsilon}.$$ Numbers for which $\liminf(Na_N)>0$ are called badly approximable.

Such functions are: $$u(n)=\sqrt[3^n]{P_n}$$ $$v(n)=\sqrt[3^n]{P_n+1}$$ He then proves the following three statements: 1) $$\sqrt[3^n]{P_n+1}>\sqrt[3^n]{P_n}$$ 2) $$\sqrt[3^{n+1}]{P_{n+1}}>\sqrt[3^n]{P_n}$$ 3) $$\sqrt[3^{n+1}]{P_{n+1}+1}<\sqrt[3^n]{P_n+1}$$ Unfortunately, I don't understand what follows, starting from ""It follows at once that the $u_n$ form a bounded monotone increasing sequence"". What is a bounded monotone increasing sequence? And what is $\lim_{n\to\infty}{u_n}$? I'd like to understand this final part of the proof. Thanks in advance!!",,"['number-theory', 'prime-numbers']"
94,Discrete Math: Finding the inverse of (natural) modulo (natural),Discrete Math: Finding the inverse of (natural) modulo (natural),,"Basically the style of the question is like this: Find the inverse of $24$, modulo $35$. The answer I get is $-16$ whereas wolframalpha gets 19. I know that $35 - 16 = 19$. The question isn't necessarily how I find the inverse- but rather (since my exam is tomorrow)- how do I know when to convert a negative inverse into a positive one? And do I always use the rule of adding the negative to the larger number to get the desired inverse? I ask mainly because I thought I've been getting the wrong inverses but its just that my book's answer key converts the negative to a positive inverse. However I don't recall my professor ever mentioning anything of this so I'm not sure what answer I should put on my exam tomorrow- and I don't know if context matters (is it okay to put down the inverse even if its negative sometimes). TLDR; If the extended Euclidean Algorithm gives a negative inverse: How do I know what answer my instructor or someone else is looking for?
