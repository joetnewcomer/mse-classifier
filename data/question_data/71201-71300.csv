5,Exercise 1.1.18 in Hatcher's Algebraic Topology,Exercise 1.1.18 in Hatcher's Algebraic Topology,,"Background I am currently trying to solve exercise 1.1.18 in Hatcher's Algebraic Topology. The part of the exercise I am interested in is the following: Using the technique in the proof of Proposition 1.14, show that if a space $X$ is obtained from a path-connected subspace $A$ by attaching an n-cell $e^n$ with $n ≥ 2$, then the inclusion $A \hookrightarrow X$ induces a surjection on $\pi_1$ . I know that $i:A \hookrightarrow X$ induces a homomorphism $i_*:\pi_1(A)\rightarrow \pi_1(X)$, so I only need to show this is a surjection. I think I understand the idea of the proof, which is to show that every loop $f\in \pi_1(X)$ is homotopic to a loop which is contained entirely in $A$. Hatcher's suggestion is to follow the proof $\pi_1(S^n)=0$ for $n\geq 2$, meaning that we should be able to push the sections of $f$ which are in the attached $n$-cell $e^n$ out. This is causing me a bit of trouble. Attempt Since $X$ is defined to be the result of attaching an $n$-cell to $A$ via some attaching map $\varphi:\partial D^n\rightarrow X$, it has the form $X=A \amalg e^n/\sim$, where $x\sim \varphi(x)$ for all $x \in \partial D^n$. Note first that since $A$ and $e^n$ are path connected, the adjunction space $X=A\cup_\varphi e^n$ is path connected. As such, our choice of base point does not affect the structure of $\pi_1(X)$, so let $x_0 \in A$ be the base point of $\pi_1(X)$ we are working over. Let $f \in \pi_1(X,x_0)$. Let $E=\text{Int}(e^n)$ and consider $f^{-1}(E)$. This is an open subset of $(0,1)$, so it is the union of a possibly infinite collection of subsets of $(0,1)$ of the form $(a_i,b_i)$. Let $f_i$ denote the restriction of $f$ to $(a_i,b_i)$. Note that $f_i$ lies in $e^n$ and, in particular, $f(a_i)$ and $f(b_i)$ lie on the boundary of $e^n$, so they are elements of $A$. For $n\geq 2$ we can homotopy $f_i$ to the path $g_i$ from $f(a_i)$ to $f(b_i)$ that goes along the boundary of $e^n$, which is homeomorphic to $S^{n-1}$, so it is path connected for $n\geq 2$. Since $e^n$ is homeomorphic to $D^n$, where $n\geq 2$, it is simply connected so $f_i$ and $g_i$ are homotopic. Repeating this process for all $f_i$, we obtain a loop $g$ homotopic to $f$ such that $g(I)\subseteq A$. What really bothers me about this is how I could homotopy form a homotopy from $f$ to $g$ consisting of possibly infinitely many individual homotopies from $f_i$ to $g_i$. I believe I need there to only be finitely many $f_i's$, but I don't see how to show it.

Under which circumstances is there some topology $\tau$ on $X$ such that $f$ maps each point $x$ to the set of converging sequences in $\tau$ with limit $x$ ?  The finest topology which realizes all sequences in $f$ is $$\tau:=\{A\subseteq X:\forall x\in A.\forall s\in f(x).\exists N\ge 0.\{s_n\}_{n\ge N}\subseteq A\}.$$ But how to make sure no new converging sequences emerge in $\tau$ ? There is an (open) neighbourhood base of $\tau$ whose sets $A_x$ can be constructed the following way: Modify $f$ by replacing any sequence with a tail of itself, call the result $f'$ .  Then define inductively $A_0:=\{x\}$ , $A_{i+1}:=A_i\cup(\cup_{y\in A_i,n\ge 0}f'(y)_n)$ and take $A_x=A_{f',x}:=\cup_{i\ge 0} A_i$ .  Since for the construction of $f'$ one only needs to take into account the $f'(y)$ for $y$ 'reachable' from $x$ , which all sit in an $\omega$ -branching tree of height $\omega$ , this base is countable. So one way to make sure $\tau$ doesn't realize new sequences is to demand that for any sequence $s$ and $x\in X$ such that for any $f'$ as above there is some tail of $s$ living in $A_{f',x}$ we must have $s\in f(x)$ . But is there a simpler way to put this? Clearly, for $s\in f(x)$ and any sequence $(k(n))_n$ of natural numbers converging to $\infty$ we need $(s_{k(n)})_n$ to be in $f(x)$ , also $f(x)$ must contain the constant $x$ -sequence and be closed under mergence of a finite number of sequences.

Consider $X=\mathbf{R}$ and $f(u)$ containing all sequences $(u\pm v2^{-n})_n$ for some $v\in[1,2)$ plus their closure under the constructions just discussed.  This $f$ produces the Euclidean topology, but obviously doesn't contain all convergent sequences in the Euclidean space and it's really hard to see (for me) if there is some simple, abstract condition that $f$ fails to satisfy. One more condition I could think of, which is true whenever $\tau$ is first-countable, is that for $s\in f(x)$ and $(t^n)_n$ with $t^n\in f(s_n)$ there exists a sequence of natural numbers $(k(n))_n$ such that any $s'$ with $s'_n\in\{t^n_m\}_{m\ge k(n)}$ must be contained in $f(x)$ . But here take again $X=\mathbf{R}$ with $f(u)$ consisting of all sequences $s$ such that $s_n\in u\pm(v-w_n,v+w_n)2^{-n}$ for some $v\in[1,2)$ and $w\in\mathbf{R}^\omega_{>0}$ converging to $0$ , this satisfies the last condition but doesn't contain all convergent sequences in the Euclidean space, even if we take all the closures discussed before.","Let be a set and .

(e) Show the result in (d) need not hold if $A$ is closed but not compact. This and this are two Math SE posts on this problem. And, here is also a solution to this problem. I think I'm clear on parts (a) through (c) of this problem. So here I'll give my attempt at part (d). My Attempt: First, some notation: For any point $x \in X$ , we define $$ d(x, A)  \colon= \inf \{ \ d(x, a) \ \vert \ a \in A \ \}. \tag{Definition A} $$ And, for any point $p \in X$ and for any real number $\delta > 0$ , we define $$ B_d (p, \delta) \colon= \{ \ x \in X \ \vert \ d(x, p) < \delta \ \}. \tag{Definition B} $$ As $U$ is an open set in $X$ with the metric topology determined by the metric $d$ , so, for every element $u \in U$ , there exists a real number $\epsilon_u > 0$ such that $$ B_d \left( u, \epsilon_u \right) \subset U. $$ [Refer to Sec. 20 in Munkres, especially the portion of the section preceding Example 1.] In particular, as $A \subset U$ , so, for every element $a \in A$ , we can find a real number $\epsilon_a > 0$ such that $$ B_d \left( a, \epsilon_a \right) \subset U. \tag{1} $$ For each such $\epsilon_a > 0$ , let us choose a real number $\delta_a$ such that $$ 0 < \delta_a \leq \frac{\epsilon_a}{2}. \tag{2} $$ Now let us consider the collection $$ \left\{ \ B_d \left( a, \delta_a \right) \ \vert \ a \in A \ \right\}. $$ This is a collection of open sets of $X$ whose union contains the set $A$ ; that is, this collection is a covering of $A$ by sets open in $X$ . So, by Lemma 26.1 in Munkres, there is some finite sub-collection of this collection that also covers $A$ .

Formally, these descriptors do look different because a different $n$ is NOT mapped to a different $x$, but I'm not sure when this point of view becomes useful since the reason why either of these pairs fails to define a surjection is the same. Maybe this example is too boiled down? what's the context when these logical subtleties start to ""work""?",,['general-topology']

It may seem more like a discussion, but I would prefer it took place as an actual post because I want to do more than just chat about it. There is a specific question at the end of this. Main Event Starting at the bottom (or top if you like) of the abstract analysis ladder we have a set with no structure. Then we go up (or down) to the next rung and define a topology and we have continuity of a function $f: X \to Y$, $X$ and $Y$ both topological spaces, with $U = f^{-1}(V)$ open in $X$ whenever $V$ open in $Y$. We can already talk about the continuity of addition and scalar multiplication in a vector space, just by defining a topology. With limits of sequences it involves having arbitrary open neighbourhoods of a point leaving out only finitely many points of the sequence. Then, if we want things to have distances between them, we move to another rung and define a metric, preferably one of actual use in solving an interesting problem in analysis as opposed to a pathological counterexample, and determine if our spaces of interest are metrizable and so on. The Actual Question Now we can start talking about complete metric spaces. Every where I look, completeness is discussed in the context of a metric space. For example, in Steen and Seebach's Counterexamples in Topolgy, their definition of completeness is given in terms of a metric space, Munkres likewise. Here's where I muse that we've made topological versions of continuity and convergence that can be applied just using a topology, so is there a version of completeness that can be defined purely topologically? Convergence can, so if Cauchy could then there it would be. Philosophical Epilogue For me the whole point of building the current massive edifice of abstract mathematical machinery was to illuminate everything at the most fundamental level in order to refine our understanding and move on to greater mathematical heights rather than get bogged down in the particular details of a particular version of a particular type of problem. Are we succeeding? Or is maths just becoming far too complicated? Conclusion After the discussion below, the point highlighted is that Cauchyness involves closeness and how to do that without a metric. I had originally mistakenly thought Cauchyness could find its way into a pure topological setting because I had forgotten that I was using a topological definition that was being used on vector spaces without the advantage of a metric. The advantage of subtracting is none the less there and kills the point. I realised how careful one has to be with the words one uses to discuss this, even in matters that are allowed. What does ""zero"" even mean in an arbitrary set? Originally above I used the word ""small"" when referring to convergence. It's kind of implied in the fact that $N$ may have to be really, really big depending on which open neighbourhood you choose, but we have no way of measuring ""small"" at the pure topological stage. Anyway, the answer is clear, there has to be something more than just the definition of a topology to be able to discuss completion. Even the idea of compactness doesn't get us around it in general. In spaces where the unit ball (already measuring) is not compact, we need equi-continuity to establish the compactness.

The usual proof (see for example this question ) uses ""height functions"" and some algebra; I am trying to construct a proof without using those tools, and I am nearly there. The last bit that remains is to prove that every closed path of cells without holes on a square lattice has four consecutive cells that form a square, called a knob . This seems very obvious, but I cannot come up with a proof of this fact. In this figure, there are two knobs (marked yellow and pink). My question is: how can I prove every path without holes has a knob? Edit: My original idea was to use the idea of a knob to get a way to do induction on certain types of paths. However, the proof we came up with is itself an induction proof, and I could use the method directly instead of needing to use knobs. I also discovered a few problems with my original proof plan (although the overall strategy stayed in tack. I removed some of the details I had here originally (mostly because they are wrong and not very insightful otherwise). To see how this fits into my proof, here is a sketch. A strip polyomino is a polyomino whose cells form a path. A closed strip is a strip polyomino whose cells form a closed path. A closed strip has at least two tilings ($\{c_1, c_2\}, \{c_3, c_4\}$, etc. and $\{c_n, c_1\}, \{c_2, c_3\}$,  etc.). If we have a tiled figure, and a subfigure which is a tiled closed strip, then replacing the closed strip's tiling with the dual tiling is called a strip rotation . (A flip is a special case of a strip rotation). 1. We can get one tiling of any figure from another by strip rotations. Pick any cell $c_1$ covered by dominoes in different ways in the two tilings, and construct a closed strip by picking a neighbor $c_2$ in the same domino in the one tiling, then a neighbor $c_3$ of $c_2$ within the same domino in the other tiling, etc. This must end when the next neighbor is $c_1$. (It's always possible to pick a next cell, and we can never pick a next cell again before picking $c_1$, and the figure is finite.) Now performing a strip rotation on this strip makes all the tiles match the second tiling. We repeat the process until the transformed tiling matches the second tiling completely. (Notice that in constructing the strip we never pick patches where dominoes in the two tilings match, so we will never ""undo"" dominoes already in place.) 2. A strip rotation of a strip without holes is equivalent to a sequence of flips. This is the part that requires induction. The idea is to show it for paths that correspond to a flip (rotating two dominoes) as the base case, and then to show that a path always contains a smaller path, and that with a flip of the rest and a rotation on the smaller path, we get a rotation on the bigger path. (There are a few cases here to consider.) 3. A strip rotation of a closed strip with a filled interior is equivalent to a series of flips. The idea here is to inductively add dominoes of the path's interior to the path, at times doing flips, and at times shedding dominoes from the path, until we are left with a bunch of paths that correspond to strip polyominoes without holes. Here is a simple example: We then perform strip rotations on some of these (some may already be ""in position""), which we already proved is equivalent to flips, to get the original path rotated, but potentially part of its interior too. We then rotate the interior (or each path thereof), so that the interior is back the way it started. We are left with only the outer path rotated.

82,Understanding how the Thurston Geometrization conjecture implies the Poincaré conjecture.,Understanding how the Thurston Geometrization conjecture implies the Poincaré conjecture.,,"I have already read this post, which answers the problem by first delving into the elliptization conjecture, which seems to me to be hiding details, because I don't understand how the elliptization conjecture is a special case of the Geometrization conjecture (now Theorem I suppose). Let us consider the following statement of Thurston's theorem: Theorem 1: Let $M$ be a closed, orientable, prime $3$-manifold. Then there exists an embedding of a disjoint union of incompressible $2$-tori and Klein bottles in $M$ such that every component of their complement admits a locally homogeneous Riemannian metric of finite volume, isometric to one of the $8$ model geometries. We also have the following lemma Lemma 1: If $M$ is a Riemannian Manifold, with universal cover $X$, which admits a complete locally homogeneous Riemannian metric then $M$ is isometric to $X/\Gamma$, where $\Gamma$ is the deck group of $X$. Now my attempt to understand how the Geometrization theorem implies the Poincaré conjecture is as follows: Let us now consider a compact, simply connected $3$ manifold $M$. As it has a trivial fundamental group, the decomposition referred to in Theorem 1 must be trivial (because Tori and Klein bottles have non trivial fundamental groups, so there can be no such incompressible embedded surfaces.) Thus $M$ must have a complete locally homogeneous metric. Lemma 1 thus implies that $M\simeq X/\Gamma$, where $X$ is its universal cover, and $\Gamma$ its deck group. The deck group is isomorphic to $N(H_0)/H_0$, where $N$ is the normalizer, and $H_0$ is the pushforward of the fundamental group of $X$ under the covering map. As the fundamental group is trivial this then implies that the deck group is trivial, hence $M$ is isometric to its universal cover $X$. Now I'm hoping that a simply connected $3$ manifold being isometric to its universal cover means it has to be diffeomorphic to $S^3$, but so far have found no evidence to support my hope. Am I on the right track? Or do I need to consider something fundamentally different? As is apparent from this post I am a novice in the areas of differential geometry and algebraic topology, so would appreciate it if answers used as simple tools as possible. I am also aware of the Kesner decomposition theorem, but I am sure understand none of its subtleties.

In which of these topologies are the following functions from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ continuous?    $$f(t) = \left( t, 2t, 3t, \ldots \right),$$   $$g(t) = \left( t, t, t, \ldots \right),$$   $$h(t) = \left( t, \frac{t}{2}, \frac{t}{3}, \ldots \right)$$   for each $t \in \mathbb{R}$. Let $U \colon= \prod_{n \in \mathbb{N}} U_n$ be a product topology basis element for $\mathbb{R}^\omega$; let $n_1, \ldots, n_k$ be the natural numbers such that $U_{n_i}$ is a proper open subset of $\mathbb{R}$ for each $i = 1, \ldots, k$; suppose $U_n = \mathbb{R}$ for all other $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Suppose $t \in f^{-1}(U)$ so that $f(t) \in U$ and hence $$\pi_{n_i}\left(f(t) \right) = n_i t \in  U_{n_i}$$ for each $i = 1, \ldots, k$. Here, for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the map  $\pi_n \colon \mathbb{R}^\omega \to \mathbb{R}$ is defined by $$\pi_n(x) \colon= x_n \ \mbox{ for all } \ x \colon= \left( x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots \right) \in \mathbb{R}^\omega.$$ Since $U_{n_i}$ is open in $\mathbb{R}$ under the usual topology, there exists a positive real number $\delta_i$ such that  $$\left( \pi_{n_i}\left( f(t) \right) - \delta_i, \pi_{n_i}\left( f(t) \right) + \delta_i \right) = \left( n_i t - \delta_i , n_i t + \delta_i \right) \subset U_{n_i}$$ for each $i = 1, \ldots, k$.  Let $$\delta \colon= \min \left\{ \frac{\delta_1}{n_1}, \ldots, \frac{\delta_k}{n_k} \right\}. $$ This $\delta$ is a positive real number, and if $s \in (t- \delta, t+\delta)$, then $$ t - \frac{ \delta_{n_i} }{ n_i } < s < t + \frac{ \delta_{n_i} }{ n_i },$$ which implies that $$n_i t - \delta_i <  n_i s < n_i t + \delta_i,$$ which in turn implies that $$n_i s \in U_{n_i},$$ for each $i = 1, \ldots, k$, and hence $f(s) \in U$. Thus, for each $t \in f^{-1}(U)$, there is a positive real number $\delta$ such that $$t \in (t- \delta, t + \delta) \subset f^{-1}(U),$$ showing that the inverse image $f^{-1}(U)$ is open for each basis element $U$ of the product topology on $\mathbb{R}^\omega$. Now suppose that $t \in g^{-1}(U)$. Then, for each $i = 1, \ldots, k$,  $$\pi_{n_i}\left( g(t) \right) = t \in U_{n_i}$$ and hence $$\left( t - \delta_i, t+\delta_i \right) \subset U_{n_i}$$ for some positive real number $\delta_i$. Let $$\delta \colon= \min \left\{ \delta_1, \ldots, \delta_k \right\}.$$ This $\delta$ is a positive real number, and if $s \in ( t-\delta, t+\delta )$, then $s \in \left(t-\delta_i, t + \delta_i \right)$ and hence $g(s) \in U$, showing that $g^{-1}(U)$ is open. Finaly, if $t \in h^{-1}(U)$, then, for each $i = 1, \ldots, k$,  $$ \pi_{n_i}\left( h(t) \right) = \frac{t}{n_i} \in U_{n_i}$$ and hence $$\left( \frac{t}{n_i} - \delta_i , \frac{t}{n_i} + \delta_i \right) \subset U_{n_i}$$ for some positive real number $\delta_i$. Let's take $$\delta \colon= \min \left\{ n_1 \delta_1, \ldots, n_k \delta_k \right\}.$$ This $\delta $ is a positive real number, and if $s \in (t - \delta , t + \delta )$, then  $$t- n_i \delta_i < s < t + n_i \delta_i$$ and hence  $$ \frac{t}{n_i} - \delta_i < \frac{s}{n_i} < \frac{t}{n_i} + \delta_i $$ or $$ \pi_{n_i}\left( h(s) \right) \in \left( \frac{t}{n_i} - \delta_i, \frac{t}{n_i} + \delta_i \right) \subset U_{n_i}$$ for each $i = 1, \ldots, k$, which implies that $s \in h^{-1}(U)$, from which it follows that $h^{-1}(U)$ is open in $\mathbb{R}$. Have I been able to get these proofs right? Now for the uniform topology. Let's take a real number $\varepsilon$ such that $0 < \varepsilon < \frac 1 2$. Let $t \in \mathbb{R}$. If $s \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $s \neq t$, then $$\tilde{\rho}\left( f(s), f(t) \right) = \sup \left\{ \ \min \left\{ n \vert s-t\vert, 1 \right\} \ \colon \ n \in \mathbb{N} \ \right\} = 1 > \varepsilon,$$ from which it follows that $f$ is not continuous (at any point of $\mathbb{R}$). Now let us take a real number $\delta$ such that $0 < \delta \leq \varepsilon$. Then, for any points $s, t \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $\vert s-t \vert < \delta$, we have $$\tilde{\rho}\left( g(s), g(t) \right) = \sup \left\{ \ \min \left\{ \vert s-t \vert, 1 \right\} \ \colon \  n \in \mathbb{N} \right\} = \vert s- t \vert < \varepsilon,$$ and hence it follows that $g$ is (uniformly) continuous. Now let's choose $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ as above. Then, for any $s, t \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $\vert s-t\vert < \delta$, we have  $$\tilde{\rho}\left( h(s), h(t) \right) = \sup \left\{ \ \min \left\{ \frac{\vert s-t \vert}{n}, 1 \right\} \ \colon \ n \in \mathbb{N} \ \right\} = \min \left\{ \vert s-t\vert, 1 \right\} = \vert s-t\vert < \varepsilon,$$ from which it follows that $h$ is (uniformly) continuous. Have I been able to come up with the right answer in each case? If so, have I been able to get these proofs right as well? For the product topology, we can also use Theorem 19.6 in Munkres. Here I have attempted to show the continuity of $f$, $g$, and $h$ directly. And, the box topology on $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ is the one havaing as a basis all sets of the form  $$ (a_1, b_1) \times (a_2, b_2) \times (a_3, b_3) \times \cdots, $$ where $\left(a_i \right)_{i \in \mathbb{N}} \in \mathbb{R}^\omega$ and $\left(b_i \right)_{i \in \mathbb{N}} \in \mathbb{R}^\omega$ are such that $a_i < b_i$ for each $i = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$, and $(a_i, b_i)$ denotes the segment (i.e. open interval) with $a_i$ as the left endpoint and $b_i$ as the right endpoint. The functions $f$, $g$, and $h$ are not continuous when $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ is given the box topology. The inverse image under each of  $f$, $g$, and $h$ of the basis element  $$B \colon= \left( -1, 1 \right) \times \left(-\frac{1}{2^2}, \frac{1}{2^2} \right) \times \left( -\frac{1}{3^2}, \frac{1}{3^2} \right) \times \cdots, $$  for example, contains the point $t = 0$ since  $$f(0) = g(0) = h(0) = (0, 0, 0, \ldots) \in B.$$ So, in order for this inverse image to be open in $\mathbb{R}$ with the usual topology, there must be an open interval $\left(-\delta_f, \delta_f \right)$, $\left( -\delta_g, \delta_g \right)$, and $\left( -\delta_h, \delta_h \right)$, for some positive real numbers $\delta_f$, $\delta_g$, and $\delta_h$, respectively, such that  $$ \left(-\delta_f, \delta_f \right) \subset f^{-1}(B),$$  $$\left( -\delta_g, \delta_g \right) \subset g^{-1}(B), $$ $$\left( -\delta_h, \delta_h \right) \subset h^{-1}(B). $$ In particular, we must have  $$f\left( \frac{\delta_f}{2} \right) \in B,$$ $$g\left( \frac{\delta_g}{2} \right) \in B,$$ $$h\left( \frac{\delta_h}{2} \right) \in B.$$  So, for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we have  $$\frac{n \delta_f}{2} \in \left( - \frac{1}{n^2}, \frac{1}{n^2}\right), \ \frac{\delta_g}{2} \in \left( - \frac{1}{n^2}, \frac{1}{n^2}\right), \ \frac{\delta_h}{2n} \in \left( - \frac{1}{n^2}, \frac{1}{n^2}\right), $$  and hence  $$n^3 < \frac{2}{ \delta_f } \ \mbox{ for all} \  n \in \mathbb{N},$$ $$n^2 < \frac{2}{ \delta_g } \ \mbox{ for all} \  n \in \mathbb{N},$$ $$n < \frac{2}{ \delta_h } \ \mbox{ for all} \  n \in \mathbb{N},$$ each of which is impossible. Am I right? That $g$ is not continuous was also shown by Munkres himself in Example 2, Sec. 19 on page 117.","Here is Prob. 20 (a) in the book Topology by James R. Munkres, 2nd edition.

97,"Tautological line bundle over $\mathbb{RP}^n$ isomorphic to normal bundle? Also ""splitting"" of transition functions","Tautological line bundle over  isomorphic to normal bundle? Also ""splitting"" of transition functions",\mathbb{RP}^n,"Hallo fellow mathematicians. I try to understand why the normal bundle of $\mathbb{PR}^n$ is isomorphic (in the category of vector bundles) to the tautological line Bundle. More aptly, why $\nu_{\mathbb{RP}^{n+1}}^{\beta} \mathbb{RP}^n \cong L, \text{ where } L$ denotes the tautological line bundle over $\mathbb{RP}^n$ and $ \beta \colon \mathbb{RP}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{RP}^{n+1} $ the inclusion induced by the inclusion $\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+2}$. I followed a few loose ends until now.  One of them: (1) In this script (pdf) I found a proof (p.8). I just don't understand, how that is supposed to be suffice as proof. Afaik under trivialisations I could identify every vector bundle of the same dimension, so what seals the proof here? Another idea I came up with: (2) On $\mathbb{PR}^{n+1}$ we have a riemannian metric, i.e. the tangent bundle allows a presentation as the whitney-sum: $\nu_{\mathbb{RP}^{n+1}}^{\beta} \mathbb{RP}^n \oplus T \mathbb{PR}^n  \cong T\mathbb{RP}^{n+1}|_{\mathbb{PR}^n} $. According to Husemoller (Fibre Bundles, Theorem 2.7) we now ( analogous to this ) that two vector bundles - in order to be isomorphic - have to have cohomologous transition functions, i.e. they are related in a certain way to each other. Afaik we can split the transition functions of $T\mathbb{PR}^{n+1}$ into the direct sum (in the sense that $\phi_{ij}(p)=\begin{matrix} \phi_{ij}^1(p)	& 0  \\  0	& \phi_{ij}^2(p) \end{matrix} $ is the transition function of $T\mathbb{PR}^{n+1}$, where $ \phi_{ij}^1$ is the trans. function of $T\mathbb{PR}^{n}$ and $ \phi_{ij}^2 $ the is trans. function of the normal bundle). As soon as I try to compute all this I encounter problems. So I took the transition functions of the ""standard"" atlas of $\mathbb{RP}^n$, i.e. with $U_i:=\{[x_1:\dots x_n]|x_i \neq 0 \}$ the transition function is $\phi_j \circ \phi_i^{-1} (y^1, \dots y^n)=(\frac{y^1}{y^j}, \dots \frac{y^{i-1}}{y^{j}}, \frac{1}{y^j}, \frac{y^{i+1}}{y^j}, \dots,\frac{y^n}{y^j})$.

I try to understand why the normal bundle of $\mathbb{PR}^n$ is isomorphic (in the category of vector bundles) to the tautological line Bundle. More aptly, why $\nu_{\mathbb{RP}^{n+1}}^{\beta} \mathbb{RP}^n \cong L, \text{ where } L$ denotes the tautological line bundle over $\mathbb{RP}^n$ and $ \beta \colon \mathbb{RP}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{RP}^{n+1} $ the inclusion induced by the inclusion $\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+2}$. I followed a few loose ends until now.  One of them: (1) In this script (pdf) I found a proof (p.8). I just don't understand, how that is supposed to be suffice as proof. Afaik under trivialisations I could identify every vector bundle of the same dimension, so what seals the proof here? Another idea I came up with: (2) On $\mathbb{PR}^{n+1}$ we have a riemannian metric, i.e. the tangent bundle allows a presentation as the whitney-sum: $\nu_{\mathbb{RP}^{n+1}}^{\beta} \mathbb{RP}^n \oplus T \mathbb{PR}^n  \cong T\mathbb{RP}^{n+1}|_{\mathbb{PR}^n} $. According to Husemoller (Fibre Bundles, Theorem 2.7) we now ( analogous to this ) that two vector bundles - in order to be isomorphic - have to have cohomologous transition functions, i.e. they are related in a certain way to each other. Afaik we can split the transition functions of $T\mathbb{PR}^{n+1}$ into the direct sum (in the sense that $\phi_{ij}(p)=\begin{matrix} \phi_{ij}^1(p)	& 0  \\  0	& \phi_{ij}^2(p) \end{matrix} $ is the transition function of $T\mathbb{PR}^{n+1}$, where $ \phi_{ij}^1$ is the trans. function of $T\mathbb{PR}^{n}$ and $ \phi_{ij}^2 $ the is trans. function of the normal bundle). As soon as I try to compute all this I encounter problems. So I took the transition functions of the ""standard"" atlas of $\mathbb{RP}^n$, i.e. with $U_i:=\{[x_1:\dots x_n]|x_i \neq 0 \}$ the transition function is $\phi_j \circ \phi_i^{-1} (y^1, \dots y^n)=(\frac{y^1}{y^j}, \dots \frac{y^{i-1}}{y^{j}}, \frac{1}{y^j}, \frac{y^{i+1}}{y^j}, \dots,\frac{y^n}{y^j})$.

99,Alternate construction of the universal cover of a space,Alternate construction of the universal cover of a space,,"Suppose you have a connected, locally path connected Hausdorff space $Y$ that admits a universal covering (i.e. is semilocally simply connected). It occured to me that maybe one can describe the universal covering slightly differently than is usually done (at least from what I have seen). Fix a point $x_0\in Y$ and consider the set $$C_{x_0}([0,1]; Y)=\{ \gamma:[0,1]\to Y\textrm{ continuous path }| \gamma(0)=x_0\}$$ which is a subset of $C([0,1];Y)$ equipped with the compact-open topology . Introducing an equivalence $\simeq$ on $C([0,1];Y)$ where $\alpha \simeq \beta$ if $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are endpoint-preserving homotopic, set $$\widetilde Y= C_{x_0}([0,1];Y)/\simeq. $$ This construction certainly agrees as sets with the original (because we simply take the homotopy classes of paths starting at the given fixed point). On the other hand, one may naturally endow $\widetilde Y$ with the quotient topology of  $C_{x_0}([0,1];Y)$ by the equivalence relation $\simeq$. The question is, does this topology agree with the topology in the original construction? While I'm only really interested in proper geodesic spaces $Y$ I find it interesting that if the above is indeed the 'right' topology then there is a natural constuction that makes sense even if $Y$ does not have a universal cover (what goes wrong in that case is also an interesting question!)","Suppose you have a connected, locally path connected Hausdorff space $Y$ that admits a universal covering (i.e. is semilocally simply connected).
