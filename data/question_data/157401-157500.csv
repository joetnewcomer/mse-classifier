Indeed, if $p \equiv 1, 5, 19, 23 \pmod{24}$ , then $\bigl(\tfrac{6}{p}\bigr) = 1$ , using the Legendre symbol.

The infinitude of primes of that form is given by Dirichlet's Theorem. Returning to the original problem, fix $p \ge 7$ to be some prime congruent to $1$ , $5$ , $19$ , or $23$ modulo $24$ . By Zsigmondy's Theorem, there exists a primitive divisor of $3^{p - 1} - 2^{p - 1}$ , which is distinct from $p$ . Let it be $q$ .

7,Which composite number in a prime gap has the most divisors?,Which composite number in a prime gap has the most divisors?,,"Let $p_n$ be the $n$ -th prime. We define Most composite number : The composite number $m_n$ between $p_n$ and $p_{n+1}$ such that $m_n$ has the more divisors than any other composites in this prime gap. Least composite number : The composite number $l_n$ between $p_n$ and $p_{n+1}$ such that $l_n$ has less divisors than any other composite in this prime gap. If two or more composites in a prime gap have the highest or the lowest number of divisors then we define $m_n$ or $l_n$ to be the smallest among them. Motivation : In this prime gap, where are $m_n$ and $l_n$ likely to occur? Intuitively, bigger numbers are expected to have more divisors and so we might expect $m_n$ to be closer to $p_{n+1}$ and $l_n$ to be closer to $p_n$ . Experimental data shows that this naive intuition is only true for $l_n$ but for $m_n$ is more likely to be halfway between $p_n$ and $p_{n+1}$ . Experiment : Divide the gap between $p_n$ and $p_{n+1}$ into $2k$ equal parts for some fixed $k > 1, i = 0, 1, \ldots, 2k-1$ . Note that every composite in the prime gap will fall in one of these intervals however, not every interval will contain a composite especially if $2k > p_{n+1} - p_n$ however this does not impact our experiment. $$ \left(p_n + \frac{i(p_{n+1} - p_n)}{2k}, p_n + \frac{(i+1)(p_{n+1} - p_n)}{2k} \right] $$ We plot a graph with $i$ on the $X$ -axis and the frequency the above interval contains $m_n$ on the $Y$ -axis for different values of $n$ . Observation : The data shows that given any $k$ , the most composite number $m_n$ has the highest frequency in the interval $$ \left(p_n + \frac{(k-1)(p_{n+1} - p_n)}{2k}, p_n + \frac{k(p_{n+1} - p_n)}{2k} \right]  \tag 1 $$ and lowest frequency in in the very next interval $$ \left(p_n + \frac{k(p_{n+1} - p_n)}{2k}, p_n + \frac{(k+1)(p_{n+1} - p_n)}{2k} \right]  \tag 2 $$ The experiment was run twice, first for $n \le 10^8$ and second for $2.8 \times 10^{16} < n < 2.8 \times 10^{16} + 10^7$ . In both cases, consistent result was observed. Numerically, for $k=5$ , and $2.8 \times 10^{16} < n < 2.8 \times 10^{16} + 10^7$ about $17.7\%$ of $m_n$ occurred in $(1)$ the middle decile; the next highest was $11.2\%$ which occurred in the first decile and only $5.98\%$ fell in $(2)$ ; the middle decile. This shows that the mid-point $\displaystyle \frac{p_n + p_{n+1}}{2}$ is the top candidate for being the most composite number. Also since interval $(1)$ had the highest frequency while $(2)$ had the lowest frequency, in case the mid-point did not have the highest number of divisors, the next best candidate would be the composite preceding the mid-point.

Let $d$ be the greatest common divisor of all elements of $D$ , then by induction we easily have that $\sigma(x)\equiv \sigma(0) (mod\;d),\forall x\in\mathbb{Z}$ , because $\sigma$ is a permutation we must have $d=1$ , so the all elements of $D$ are coprime.

We build the permutation $\sigma$ as follow: For $x\in\mathbb{Z}$ , we write $x=cq+r,q,r\in\mathbb{Z},0\leq r<c$ . We choose the unique $s\in\mathbb{Z}$ such as $ar\equiv s(\mod\;c)$ and define $\sigma(cq+r)=cq+s$ . Because $gcd(c,a)=1$ so $\sigma$ is a permutation.

Let $f(1)=1,$ and $f(ab)=f(a)f(b)$ whenever $\gcd(a,b)=1.$ Note that I am assuming that $f$ is multiplicative but not completely multiplicative. Let $\mathbb{P}$ be the set of all primes.

Is it true that $f=\mathrm{id}_{\mathbb{N}}?$ I think $f$ is indeed the identity function. I do not have a full proof of this, but I've made some progress: We begin by showing that $f(2)=2.$ Let $p_0$ (as given in the question) not be $2.$ Then, $f(2p_0)=f(2)f(p_0)$ since $\gcd(2,p_0)=1.$ Also, $f(2p_0)=f(p_0+p_0)=f(p_0)+f(p_0)=2f(p_0).$ So, $f(2)f(p_0)=2f(p_0).$ Since $f(p_0)≠0,$ we get that $f(2)=2.$ Suppose $p_0=2.$ Then, $f(10)=f(2)f(5)=f(5+5)=f(5)+f(5)=2f(5).$ Now, we show that $f(5)≠0.$ For the sake of contradiction, let $f(5)=0.$ Then, $f(5)=f(2)+f(3)=0.$ This gives $f(2)=-f(3).$ Since $f(2)\geq0,$ we get that $f(2)=0.$ This contradicts the fact that $f(p_0)=f(2)$ is unequal to $0.$ So, $f(5)≠0.$ Then, from $f(2)f(5)=2f(5),$ we can cancel out $f(5)$ and get $f(2)=2.$ From this, we also get $f(4)=4.$ Now, $f(12)=f(4)f(3)=4f(3)=f(7)+f(5)=f(3)+f(4)+f(2)+f(3)=6+2f(3).$ So, $4f(3)=6+2f(3).$ Hence, $f(3)=3.$ So far, we have: $$f(1)=1,$$ $$f(2)=2,$$ $$f(3)=3,$$ $$f(4)=f(2+2)=f(2)+f(2)=4,$$ $$f(5)=f(2+3)=f(2)+f(3)=5,$$ $$f(6)=f(2)f(3)=6,$$ $$f(7)=f(2)+f(5)=7,$$ $$f(8)=f(3)+f(5)=8,$$ $$f(9)=f(2)+f(7)=9,$$ $$f(10)=f(2)f(5)=10.$$ Now, I proceed by induction. I treat $1$ through $10$ as my base cases. Now, let $f(n)=n$ for each $n\in\{1,2,3,\ldots,k\}$ for some natural $k>10.$ Consider $f(k+1).$ If $k+1$ is composite and not a perfect prime power, then, $k+1=ab$ for some $a,b\in\{1,2,3,\ldots,k\},$ and $\gcd(a,b)=1.$ So, $f(k+1)=k+1.$ If $k+1$ is prime, it is odd since $k+1>2.$ So, $k$ is even. This implies that $k+4$ is even too. So, $k+4$ is composite. If $k+4$ is not a prime power, $f(k+4)=k+4$ since it can be written as $ab$ with $a,b\in\{1,2,3,\ldots,k\},$ and $\gcd(a,b)=1.$ Now, $f(k+4)=f(k+1+3)=f(k+1)+f(3)=f(k+1)+3=k+4.$ So, $f(k+1)=k+1.$ If $k+4$ is a prime power, it must be a power of $2$ since it's even. In that case, $k+6$ is not a prime power as it too, must be a power of $2$ if it is, and powers of $2$ cannot be seperated by $2$ unless they are $2$ and $4.$ So, $k+6=ab$ with $a,b\in\{1,2,3,\ldots,k\},$ and $\gcd(a,b)=1.$ Hence, $f(k+6)=k+6.$ Now, $f(k+6)=f(k+1+5)=f(k+1)+5=k+6.$ Hence, $f(k+1)=k+1.$ However, I am unable to deal with the case where $k+1$ is itself a prime power. Note: As an interesting aside, if we assume Goldbach's conjecture, then, using the induction assumption, we may show that $f(2a)=2a$ for all $2a$ that can be written as a sum of primes $p$ and $q$ with $p,q\in\{1,2,3,\ldots,k\}.$","Let be a function.

View it as a quadratic equation of $a$ , then by Vieta's formula, we know that there exists $a'$ s.t. $a+a'=kbc$ , $aa'=b^2+c^2-k$ , so $$a'=\frac{b^2+c^2-k}{a}\leqslant 2a-\frac k a=2a-\frac{a+a'}{abc},$$ which is $$\left(1+\frac 1 {abc}\right)a'\leqslant 2a-\frac 1{bc}.$$ Therefore, if $a'>0$ $$a\leqslant a'\leqslant \frac{2abc-1}{bc}\,\frac{abc}{abc+1}=2a-\frac{3a}{abc+1}\leqslant 2a-\frac 3 {bc+1}.$$ We get $3a\leqslant a(abc+1)$ , so $abc\geqslant 2$ , which implies $a\geqslant 2$ . Let $f(x)=x^2-kbcx+\left(b^2+c^2-k\right)$ , then if $a=b$ , $f(b)=0$ . By $f(c)\geqslant 0$ , we have $$b^2+2c^2-kbc^2-k-\left(2b^2+c^2-kb^2c-k\right)\geqslant 0 \implies kbc\geqslant b+c.$$ Hope I kinda want to prove a strict inequality $a>b>c$ .

Edit (October 21, 2022) I know how to solve the $n=3$ case now (strengthening to $k=\alpha^2+\beta^2$ where $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb N$ ), but not the $n=4$ case. The proof doesn't incorporates the sum of two squares theorem. Proof. Suppose $(a_0, b_0, c_0)$ is the minimal solution of the equation $$\frac{a^2+b^2+c^2}{abc+1}=k$$ where $k$ is an positive integer and $a_0\geqslant b_0\geqslant c_0\geqslant 1$ . By Vieta's formulas we know that there exists $a'\in\mathbb Z$ s.t. $a_0+a'=kb_0c_0$ and $a_0a'=b_0^2+c_0^2-k$ . Case 1: $a'<0$ . Then $a'b_0c_0+1\leqslant 0 \implies k(a'b_0c_0+1)\leqslant0 <a'^2+b_0^2+c_0^2$ , which is a contradiction. Case 2: $a'=0$ . $k=b_0^2+c_0^2$ . Correct. Case 3: $a'>0$ . By the minimality of $a_0$ , we must have $a'\geqslant a_0\geqslant b_0\geqslant c_0\geqslant1$ , so $$a'b_0\leqslant a_0a'=b_0^2+c_0^2-k\leqslant 2b_0^2-k<2b_0^2 \implies a'<2b_0\,,$$ $\implies 4b_0=2b_0+2b_0>a_0+a'=kb_0c_0$ $\implies 4>kc_0$ . If $k$ cannot be represented as a sum of two squares $k$ must be $3$ , and $c_0=1$ . Then, $b^2\leqslant a_0a'=b_0^2+c_0^2-k=b_0^2-2$ , which is also a contradiction.

In order to define binomial density, let's first rewrite the natural density (if it exists) as $$d\left(A\right)=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^{n}a\left(k\right)=\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{k=1}^{n}a\left(k\right)\cdot\frac{1}{n}=\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{k=1}^{n}a\left(k\right)u\left(k,n\right),$$ where $u\left(k,n\right)=\frac{1}{n}$ is the (uniform) probability of selecting $k$ in $\left\{1,\ldots,n\right\}$ . Let's replace the uniform distribution with the binomial distribution. Let $b\left(k,n,p\right)={n\choose k}p^{k}\left(1-p\right)^{n-k}$ for $k=0,1,\ldots, n$ and $0$ otherwise (making sure to select $p\neq0,1$ ).

Diaconis gives the following combinatorial interpretation of binomial density: Flip a coin $n$ times and count how many heads show up. For large $n$ , the probability that the resulting number of heads flipped is in the set $A$ is approximately $\ell$ .

34,"What is exactly spectral expansion, and how is it related to Fourier?","What is exactly spectral expansion, and how is it related to Fourier?",,"In the theory of automorphic forms, we often refer to the decompositions we write as to ""spectral expansions"". I would like to understand better how this is related to spectral theory of ""relevant"" operators. Let's begin with Fourier analysis on $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ . In that case, the usual Fourier theory states that all (nice enough, say continuous and $C^1$ by parts) function $f$ can be written in the form (I write as usual $e(x) = \exp(2i\pi x)$ . \begin{equation} f(x) = \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} f_n e(nx). \end{equation} However I do not see that particularly through the glasses of spectral theory. Since $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ is a compact spaces, spectral theory essentially ensures that it has discrete spectrum. But here is part of my lack of understanding: of what kind of spectrum are we talking about? I can see that $e(n \cdot)$ is an eigenfunction for certain operators, typically the differentiation or the one-dimensional laplacian. But why do we consider these operators more than any other? In other words: is Fourier analysis inherently of this form (instead of taking other ""good operator"" to use and providing other spectral expansions)? Now, what about Fourier analysis on $\mathbb{R}$ . In that case, we have the Fourier transformation theory, and every good enough (say Schwartz, even if it is a far too strong condition) function $f$ can be written in the form \begin{equation} f(x) = \int_{\mathbb{R}} \hat{f}(y) e(xy) \mathrm{d}y.  \end{equation} This is a certain kind of ""continuous"" spectral expansion. Is it exactly a (continuous) spectral expansion (the $e(y\cdot)$ are also eigenfunctions of differential operators) or is that merely an analogy? Is there a formalism to make them both really appear as such? And, as above, is that an intrinsic form of spectral expansion or is it depending on a certain kind of operator we chose to look through? Finally, we arrive at automorphic forms. So we have a certain group $G$ , say $GL_2(\mathbb{R})$ , and we look at functions on it. It is quite a large group, so that we quotient by a maximal compact subgroup $K = O_2(\mathbb{R})$ . Any function $f$ on $G$ can therefore be expanded as \begin{equation} f(g) = \sum_{m \in \mathbb{Z}} f_m(g), \end{equation} where $f_m(g)$ satisfies the transformation rule $f_m(g r_\theta ) = e(m\theta) f_m(g)$ for the rotation $r_\theta \in K$ . I think this has a relation with the fact that $K$ is compact and should have discrete spectrum, but I do not see the relation with $f$ : it is not eve,n $K$ -invariant. Is that a kind of generalized spectral expansion, where $f$ can be summed over all the possible "" $K$ -periodic"" functions, i.e. satisfying the above transformation rule? So we have a function on $G$ and we split the study between a function on $G_K$ and a spectral decomposition over $K$ ? Finally, for more general automorphic forms and Maass forms. In that case, we decompose every function that is eigenfunction of the (hyperbolic) laplacian as a sum over the laplacian spectrum.

38,Basic Number Theory Inequality assuming Bertrand's postulate false for some n.,Basic Number Theory Inequality assuming Bertrand's postulate false for some n.,,"So I am having a hard time doing one problem from George E. Andrews Number Theory book . It is problem $4$ chapter $8$ - $3$ if anyone is curious. For it we must assume that Bertrand's Postulate is false for some $n$ (i.e. for some Integer $n$ there is NO prime $p$ such that $n<p<2n$ ). Also, we should use in our proof one inequality previously postulated. It is the following: $${2n\choose n}\leq\ Q_n \leq\ (2n)^{\pi(2n)}$$ where $Q_n$ is the product of all power of primes not exceeding $2n$ (i.e. the product of all $p^r$ where $r$ is such that $p^r \leq\ 2n <p^{r+1} $ ) and $\pi(2n)$ is the prime counting function for $2n$ . Knowing all this, I need to prove that $${2n\choose n}\leq\ (2n)^{\sqrt {2n}}R_{\frac{2}{3}n} $$ where $R_{\frac{2}{3}n} $ is the product of all primes less than $\frac{2}{3} n $ . So my first thought was to use the needed assumption to see that $\pi(2n) = \pi(n)$ and from the first inequality I would just need $$(2n)^{\pi(n)} \leq\ (2n)^{\sqrt {2n}}R_{\frac{2}{3}n} $$ to be true. But this is just false even with our assumption. Take for example $n = 7$ then you would get $14^6 = 7529536 \gt  14^{\sqrt {14}}(2 \cdot\ 3)= 116565.406$ So I am really stuck now because I find that $\frac{2}{3}n$ too specific and I don't know where it might come from for that to be true. EDIT: so I was thinking on $\phi (7)$ when I did that calculation, the actual result for $n = 7$ should be $14^4 = 38416$ and that is indeed less than $116565.406$ . So to the way might be to prove the last inequality but I still don't know how to put there the $R_ {\frac{2}{3}n}$ .

Some investigations : According to this answer of Ivan Neretin , assuming $x,y$ integers, the only possibility is $(0,1)$ with $(m,n) = (0,1)$ and $(x,y) = (1,2)$ , up to permutation. If $x=y$ , then $(m+n)x = x^2$ , so $x=m+n$ positive integer. In general $y=mx/(x-n)$ with $x>n$ . Thus we need to consider $$ ( \frac{x^2-1-m\frac{mx}{x-n}}{x}, \frac{(mx/(x-n))^2-1-nx}{mx/(x-n)}  ) $$ $$ = (\frac{(x^2-1)(x-n)-m^2x}{x(x-n)},\frac{m^2x^2-(x-n)^2(1+nx)}{mx(x-n)}) \in  \mathbb{Z}^2_{\ge 0} $$ Let $\alpha=\alpha_{n,m}$ be the root of $$P_{n,m}(x):=(x^2-1)(x-n)-m^2x$$ when $x>n$ (show unicity).

Note that if $n=m$ then $\beta = n \alpha/(\alpha-n)$ . We can assume (by symmetry) that $\alpha \le \beta$ . Let $(a,b) = ( \frac{x^2-1-my}{x}, \frac{y^2-1-nx}{y} )$ . Then for $x=\alpha$ we get $$(a,b) = (0,\frac{m^2+n^2-1}{m}),$$ and by symmetry, for $x=\beta$ , we get $$(a,b) = (\frac{m^2+n^2-1}{n},0).$$ The problem reduces to find all the $x \in [\alpha, \beta]$ such that $P_{n,m}(x)$ an $Q_{n,m}(x)$ are integers.

If yes, then yes; If not, then no. I'm learning idèles through Neukirch's Algebraic Number Theory and got stuck in a claim. Let $I_{K}$ be the idèle group of $K$ and $J_{K}$ the group of fractional ideals of $K$. Let $(\:)\colon I_{K}\to J_{K}$ be the homomorphism taking an idèle $\alpha=(\alpha_{\mathfrak{p}})$ and gives the fractional ideal  \begin{equation} (\alpha)=\prod_{\mathfrak{p}\: \text{finite}}\mathfrak{p}^{v_{\mathfrak{p}}(\alpha_{\mathfrak{p}})}. \end{equation} It is obviously surjective and has kernel consisting of $I_{K}^{S_\infty}$, which is just the product of the various $\mathcal{O}_{\mathfrak{p}}^{\times}$, but with no restriction in the archimedean places. The claim is that this induces a surjective homomorphism $C_{K}\to C_{l_{K}}$, where $C_{K}=I_{K}/K^{\times}$ is the idèle class group of $K$ and $C_{l_{K}}$ is the usual class group of $K$.

For this to be true we should have that the image of $K^{\times}$ via this map $(\:)$ is contained in the subgroup of principal ideals $P_{K}$ of $J_{K}$, but I don't think this is the case.

Are there any more? I have looked up various material on cubic Diophantines but most of what I’ve found is on equations where the coefficients of $x^3$ and $y^2$ are the same. In this particular problem, if both coefficients were equal to $1$, it would just be a nice Mordell’s equation. But the coefficient of the cubic variable is not $1$ – which is why it’s so frustrating. Still, would I be right in saying that if the solutions were to lie on an elliptic curve, there would only be finitely many of them? What if they don’t lie on an elliptic curve? Will the number of solutions still be finite?","I am interested in how to tackle this Diophantine equation: $$4x^3-y^2=3$$ The solutions I have found so far are $(1,1)$ and $(7,37)$.
