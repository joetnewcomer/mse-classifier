0,Proving the Lebesgue measure space completes the Borel measure space,Proving the Lebesgue measure space completes the Borel measure space,,"I am trying to complete Exercise 1.4.27 page 78 of Terence Tao's book ""An Introduction to Measure Theory"", but is caught up in some troublesome details. The exercise is as follows: $\bullet$ Show that the Lebesgue measure space $(\mathbb{R}^d,\mathcal{L}[\mathbb{R}^d],m)$ is the completion of the Borel measure space $(\mathbb{R}^d,\mathcal{B}[\mathbb{R}^d],m)$ I know that the completion of a measure space $(X,\mathcal{B},\mu)$ is the measure space $(X,\overline{\mathcal{B}},\overline{\mu})$ where $\overline{\mathcal{B}}=\{B\cup N |B \in \mathcal{B} \land N \in \mathcal{N}  \}$ , where $\mathcal{N}$ is the collection of subsets of the null sets of $\mathcal{B}$ , and $\overline{\mu}:B\cup N \mapsto \mu(B)$ . Claim: $\mathcal{L}[\mathbb{R}^d] \subseteq \{B \cup N | B \in \mathcal{B}[\mathbb{R}^d] \land N \in \mathcal{N}\}$ , where $\mathcal{N}:$ Borel subnull-sets Proof attempt: Part 1: We show that any $S \in \mathcal{L}[\mathbb{R}^d]$ is of the form $B \cup N$ , where $B$ is a Borel set and $N$ is a (Lebsegue) null set. Let $S \in \mathcal{L}[\mathbb{R}^d]$ . Suppose that $m(S)=\delta > 0$ . Then there is a closed set $E \subseteq S$ such that $m(S \setminus E)\leq \delta$ . Since any closed set is a Borel-set, this proves that $\Lambda=\{U\subseteq S| U \in \mathcal{B}[\mathbb{R}^d]\}$ is nonempty. Therefore, let $B=\bigcup_{A \in \Lambda} A$ be the largest Borel set contained in $S$ . Then we also have $B \in \mathcal{L}[\mathbb{R^d}]$ , and accordingly $S \setminus B \in \mathcal{L}[\mathbb{R^d}]$ . We claim that $m(S \setminus B)=0$ . Suppose not, and that $m(S \setminus B)=\gamma >0$ . Then we can once again find a closed set $F \subseteq S \setminus B$ , contradictiong the maximality of $B$ . Therefore $m(S\setminus B)=0.$ Part 2: We show that any (Lebesgue) null set is a Borel subnull set. Let $N$ be any (Lebsegue) null set. Then, given any $n \in \mathbb{N}$ , there is an open set $U_n$ containing $N$ , such that $m(U_n \setminus N)\leq 2^{-n}$ . Let $U=\cap_{n=1}^{\infty}U_n$ . Then $U$ is an open set containing $N$ , furtheremore $m(U)\leq 2^{-n}$ for any $n$ , so $m(U)=0$ . Thus, $U$ is a (Borel) null set, showing that $N \in \mathcal{N}$ . The problem however, is in part 1 of my attempted proof, as $B$ is defined as an (possibly uncountable) union of Borel sets, so I cannot guarantee that it is even well defined. I tried to change the definition of $B$ to the union of all open sets contained in $S$ , i.e. $B:=S^\circ$ , but this makes matters worse, as $m(S)>0 $ does not imply that $ S^\circ \neq \emptyset$ . Can anyone see a way around this problem?","I am trying to complete Exercise 1.4.27 page 78 of Terence Tao's book ""An Introduction to Measure Theory"", but is caught up in some troublesome details.

9,Doubt regarding definition of integral for positive measurable functions.,Doubt regarding definition of integral for positive measurable functions.,,"I am starting to study some Measurement Theory following the book Measures, Integrals and Martingales and I have a doubt regarding the definition of integral that the author provides. First he defines the integral for simple functions as $$I_{\mu}(f):=\sum_{j=0}^M y_j \mu(A_j)$$ (where $f$ is a simple function, ${A_j}\in \sigma$ -algebra and $\mu$ is a measure). Then using the previous one he defines (Definition $9.4$ ) the $\mu$ -integral of a positive measurable function as: $$\int u \, d\mu:=\sup\{I_{\mu}(g):g\leq u, g \text{ is simple}\}$$ I am not really familiar with this definition, but this looks pretty much as the ""lower integral"" on Riemann's definition. Actually I was expecting to see also a sort of ""upper integral"" too, but nothing else was stated. Does this have to do with the fact that the function $u$ is measurable (by assumption)? If not, why don't we require both the upper and the lower integral to coincide?

23,confusion about measurability requirements for Lebesgue integral,confusion about measurability requirements for Lebesgue integral,,"So, it would appear I have forgotten the basic requirements of Lebesgue integration! Let $(\Omega,\Sigma,\mu)$ be an arbitrary $\sigma$ -finite measure space.  I'm particularly interested in the real numbers equipped with the Borel measure, which we could denote $(\mathbb{R},\mathcal{B},\beta)$ .  Similarly, let $(\overline{\mathbb{R}},\overline{\mathcal{B}},\beta)$ denote the set of extended reals equipped with the Borel measure. Question 1. What measurability conditions need to be true of a function $f:\Omega\to[-\infty,\infty]$ in order for its Lebesgue integral $\int_\Omega f\;d\mu$ to be well-defined? Definition. Let $(\Omega_1,\Sigma_1)$ and $(\Omega_2,\Sigma_2)$ be measure spaces, i.e. nonempty sets equipped with $\sigma$ -algebras.  A function $f:\Omega_1\to\Omega_2$ is called $(\Sigma_1,\Sigma_2)$ - measurable if and only if $f^{-1}(A)\in\Sigma_1$ for all $A\in\Sigma_2$ . I have been laboring for some time under the impression that $f$ needs to be $(\Sigma,\overline{\Lambda})$ -measurable, where $(\overline{\mathbb{R}},\overline{\Lambda},\lambda)$ denotes the extended real numbers equipped with the Lebesgue measure. However, I've just been reading both Bogachev and Royden, and they seem to be requiring only that $f$ be ""measurable"" in the following sense:  that $\{x:f(x)<c\}\in\Sigma$ for every $c\in\mathbb{R}$ , and also $f^{-1}(\infty),f^{-1}(-\infty)\in\Sigma$ .  This turns out to be equivalent to saying that $f$ is $(\Sigma,\overline{\mathcal{B}})$ -measurable. But there are functions $f:\mathbb{R}\to[-\infty,\infty]$ which are $(\mathcal{B},\overline{\mathcal{B}})$ -measurable but not $(\mathcal{B},\overline{\Lambda})$ -measurable.  For instance, take the usual example of the homeomorphism $g:[0,2]\to[0,1]$ built out of the Cantor ""devil's staircase"" function, and extend it to all of $\mathbb{R}$ by letting $g(x)=g(0)$ whenever $x<0$ and $g(x)=g(2)$ whenever $x>2$ .  Then $g$ is continuous and hence $(\mathcal{B},\overline{\mathcal{B}})$ -measurable, but it is not $(\mathcal{B},\overline{\Lambda})$ -measurable.  Is $g$ really integrable? So, I guess Question 1 can be made more specific by breaking it up into the following: Question 2. Does the definition of the Lebesgue integral of a function $f:\Omega\to[-\infty,\infty]$ require that $f$ be $(\Sigma,\overline{\Lambda})$ -measurable, or is $(\Sigma,\overline{\mathcal{B}})$ -measurability good enough? I've also noticed that some of the Lemmas and Propositions involved with the Lebesgue integral require that $\Sigma$ be complete , i.e it contains all subsets of sets of measure zero.  The Borel $\sigma$ -algebra is the one I'm most interested in, but it is not complete.  So: Question 3. Does the definition of the Lebesgue integral of a function $f:\Omega\to[-\infty,\infty]$ require that $(\Omega,\Sigma)$ be complete?  In particular, is $(\mathbb{R},\mathcal{B})$ allowed to be used for the domain of $f$ ? According to my reading of the Royden and Bogachev texts, the answer to question 2 appears to be that we only need $(\Sigma,\overline{\mathcal{B}})$ -measurability, not $(\Sigma,\overline{\Lambda})$ -measurability.  And the answer to question 3 appears to be that no, $(\Omega,\Sigma)$ need not be complete, and that $(\mathbb{R},\mathcal{B})$ is allowed to be used.

Say that we take some $g \in L_{\infty}$ , and we define $M_g : L_p \to L_p$ by $$M_g (f) = fg.$$ Then I'd like to show that $||M_g|| = ||g||_{\infty}$ .

Then let $N$ be the subset of $X$ on which $|g(x)| < \frac{M}{2}$ . Now $0<\mu (N)<\mu(X)<\infty$ and $0<\mu(X\setminus N)<\infty$ too.

A measurable rectangle is a subset $A\times B \subseteq X\times Y$ where $A\in \mathcal{A}$, $B\in\mathcal{B}$, and $\mu(A)<\infty$, $\nu(B)<\infty$.

Now say I start by fixing a point, say $2\in A$. Interpreting the union (1) as written, the only set involved in the union is $B_{1}$, since $2$ is only in $A_{1}$. Interpreting the union this way, I don't get all of $B$, as clearly $B$ contains the point $y=4$ for instance, and $4\notin B_{1}$. On the other hand, if I interpret the $x$ as not really ""fixed"" as they say, but rather as moving along with $k$, then the union is not disjoint as claimed, because then $B=B_{1}\cup B_{2}$ yet $B_{1}\cap B_{2}\neq\emptyset$. Now, I am aware that $(A_{1}\times B_{1})\cup (A_{2}\times B_{2}) \subseteq (A_{1}\cup A_{2})\times (B_{1}\cup B_{2})$. But basically my questions are: (1) How should I interpret this union?

Please check it it is correct  and also let me know if there are methods by which I can shorten the proof a bit. Thank you. The Problem : Let $\left(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mu\right)$ be a measure space and $f,g:\Omega \to \mathbb{R}$ be Borel functions, i.e. $f^{-1}\left(\mathcal{B}\right) \subset \mathcal{F},~g^{-1}\left(\mathcal{B}\right) \subset \mathcal{F},$ where $\mathcal{B}$ denotes the Borel-$\sigma$-field of $\mathbb{R}$. Show that, if $\int_{\Omega} f d\mu$ exists and $c \in \mathbb{R},$ then $\int_{\Omega} \left(cf\right) d\mu$ exists and $$\int_{\Omega} \left(cf\right) d\mu=c\int_{\Omega} f d\mu$$ My Solution : To show existence, it is enough to show that $cf$ is Borel. We have to show that $\left(cf\right)^{-1}\left(\mathcal{B}\right) \subset \mathcal{F}$. Let us choose (arbitrarily) $B \in \mathcal{B}$. We want to show that $\left(cf\right)^{-1}\left(B\right) \in \mathcal{F}$. Note that, $\left(cf\right)^{-1}\left(B\right)=\left\{\omega \in \Omega : \left(cf\right)\left(\omega\right) \in B\right\}=\left\{\omega \in \Omega : cf\left(\omega\right) \in B\right\}$ Suppose $c=0$. Either we have $0 \in B,$ or $0 \notin B$. Thus, $\left\{\omega \in \Omega : cf\left(\omega\right) \in B\right\}=\left\{\omega \in \Omega : 0 \in B\right\}=\phi \text{ or } \Omega,$ and hence, $\left(cf\right)^{-1}\left(B\right) \in \mathcal{F}$. Now suppose $c \neq 0$. Define, $\frac{B}{c}:=\left\{\frac{b}{c} : b \in B\right\}$. Then, \begin{align*} \left(cf\right)^{-1}\left(B\right)&=\left\{\omega \in \Omega : cf\left(\omega\right) \in B\right\}\\ &=\left\{\omega \in \Omega :\exists b \in B, \text{ such that } cf\left(\omega\right)=b\right\}\\ &=\left\{\omega \in \Omega :\exists b \in B, \text{ such that } f\left(\omega\right)=\frac{b}{c}\right\}\\ &=\left\{\omega \in \Omega : f\left(\omega\right) \in \frac{B}{c}\right\}\\ &=f^{-1}\left(\frac{B}{c}\right) \end{align*} If we can show that $\frac{B}{c} \in \mathcal{B}$, we are done. Now, $B \in \mathcal{B} \implies \exists \text{ a sequence } \left(A_n\right)_{n=1}^{\infty} \text{ of open intervals in } \mathbb{R} \text{ such that } B=\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}A_n$ Claim : $\frac{B}{c}=\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{A_n}{c}$. Now, \begin{align*} a \in \frac{B}{c} &\implies \exists b \in B, \text{ such that } a=\frac{b}{c}\\ &\implies \exists n \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \left\{0\right\}, \text{ and } b \in A_n, \text{ such that } a=\frac{b}{c}\\ &\implies \exists n \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \left\{0\right\}, \text{ such that } a=\frac{A_n}{c}\\ &\implies a \in \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{A_n}{c} \end{align*} Thus, $$\frac{B}{c} \subset \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{A_n}{c}$$ To show the other side, \begin{align*} a \in \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{A_n}{c} &\implies \exists n \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \left\{0\right\}, \text{ such that } a=\frac{A_n}{c}\\ &\implies \exists n \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \left\{0\right\}, \text{ and } b \in A_n, \text{ such that } a=\frac{b}{c}\\ &\implies \exists b \in B, \text{ such that } a=\frac{b}{c}\\ &\implies a \in \frac{B}{c} \end{align*} Thus, $$\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{A_n}{c} \subset \frac{B}{c}$$ Hence we have, $$\frac{B}{c}=\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{A_n}{c}$$ The crucial (although trivial) thing is that for all $n \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \left\{0\right\}, A_n \text{ is an open interval in } \mathbb{R} \implies \frac{A_n}{c} \text{ is an open interval in } \mathbb{R}$. And hence, $\frac{B}{c} \in \mathcal{B}$. This completes the existence part.

In what follows I will take closure under (relative) complementation for granted, simply because almost all set systems which I know of (besides $\pi$ systems) have this property, its motivation is obvious, and because it is involutory it is easily added to the axioms of a set system without changing the included sets very much. Most spaces which are commonly studied have at most the continuity of the continuum (not that there aren't counterexamples, but at least I don't run into them in my work). Thus, it seems we could have at most the following types of set systems for a space which has at most the cardinality of the continuum. $\underset{f}{\cup}$, $\underset{f}{\cap}$ (Boolean) algebra $\underset{c}{\cup}$, $\underset{f}{\cap}$/$\underset{c}{\cap}$, $\underset{f}{\cup}$ (slightly stronger than a $\lambda$ system) $\underset{c}{\cup}$, $\underset{c}{\cup}$ $\sigma-$algebra $\underset{u/a}{\cup}$, $\underset{c}{\cup}$/ $\underset{u/a}{\cap}$, $\underset{c}{\cup}$  ?????

For example, all truth functions are well-defined given a Boolean algebra, as is propositional logic. The motivation for a $\sigma-$algebra is also fairly clear to me -- it is essentially the ""countable closure/extension"" of a regular algebra, and this property allows us to define countably additive set functions, and along with that obtain closure under pointwise limits of functions as well as the monotone convergence theorem, the two foundations on which integration theory is based. It is also clear that such additivity could not be extended to the cardinality of the continuum, since the uncountable sum of any non-zero numbers is infinite. But why do open/closed set systems turn out to be useful? How are these uncountable axioms applied fruitfully in topology? As far as I am aware, for example with stochastic processes, we usually rely on some separability/first/second-countability properties in order to be able to apply most topologies fruitfully -- i.e. some reduction of the ""uncountable"" axiom to an essentially countable property. So why not study only metric spaces? Moreover, the study of limits is only defined/sensible once we have the T1 and T2 separation axioms, so the claim that we study set systems of type 5. in order to study limits seems unjustified to me; at the very least we need that in combination with some separation axioms. Also, why do we study set systems of type 5., but not of types 4. or 6.? What is the essential property that type 5. set systems capture (in the way that type 1. and type 3. systems capture)? The best discussion of this topic which I have found so far: https://mathoverflow.net/questions/19152/why-is-a-topology-made-up-of-open-sets I agree with the OP of that question however, that the top-voted answer is more of a justification for the notion of metric space (which are always separable in some sense due to the density of the rationals in the reals). The discussion of how notions of limit really seem to be more of a consequence of a notion of ""Hausdorfness"" is here: Why not just study the consequences of Hausdorff axiom? What do statements like, ""The arbitrary union of open sets is open,"" gain us? I would also like to point out that the axiomatization of topology in terms of neighborhood systems, plus the Hausdorff axiom, seems to be more relevant to understanding the concept of ""limit"" than the axioms of a general topological space. And again, I don't see why we would need uncountably many neighborhoods of a given point to define it as the limit of something, since countably many neighborhoods always suffices (at least in the metric space setting). Motivation: The motivation for this question came from some rumination about stochastic processes. Namely, the reason why their study can be so difficult is that we are confined to using set systems of type 3., which are only countably closed, whereas we are studying uncountably many random variables. In order to get any degree of meaningful results, we therefore rely on having some degree of ""separability/regularity"" properties that essentially allow us to reduce to the countable case where it counts (for instance with regards to the existence of regular conditional distributions). So as frustrating as it may be trying to study uncountable objects with set systems of type 3., it is clear to me why we can not replace such set systems with any of type 4, 5, or 6, again so that integration and probability are tractable. So then I thought ""oh so we must use topologies because we need uncountability for some reason"". But then I thought about how almost all topologies which I am aware of/use are in some way ""separable"" or ""first/second-countable"", which basically constitutes reducing back to the countable case, the same way we do with stochastic processes. I.e. there is no fundamental gain in generality, since the only cases of uncountable objects we can/do study are those special cases which can be reduced back to the countable case in some meaningful way. I'm really at a loss as to why an uncountable closure axiom would be at all useful, and why we would want only finite closure for the complementary operation, rather than some type of infinite closure. I feel like it has to have something to do with the distinction between ""discrete"" and ""continuous"" spaces, which leads us back again to the study of stochastic processes, and the distinction between ""discrete"" and ""continuous"" time. Namely, for a set with countable cardinality, like the natural numbers, the power set coincides with the reasonable choices for sigma algebra and topology. In other words, both concepts are clearly only needed when moving to the uncountable case, where they don't necessarily coincide with the power set, i.e. we can gain a concept of ""continuousness"", rather than the ""discreteness"" which we are necessarily confined to with set systems of countable sets. Again, the purpose of $\sigma-$algebra in this case is clear to me, since it is actually only closed under countable set operations, but now I really don't understand why we are able to use the uncountable set axiom profitably in open/closed set systems, especially since in all cases which I am aware of we have some sort of ""separability"" which reduces the concept of topology to a countable one.
