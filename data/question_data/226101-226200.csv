1,Showing $\# E(\Bbb F_p)$ is divisible by $4$ for $p\ge3$.,Showing  is divisible by  for .,\# E(\Bbb F_p) 4 p\ge3,"I'm trying to solve the following exercise from Silverman: Let $E:y^2=x^3+x$. Show that $\# E(\Bbb F_p)$ is divisible by $4$ for prime $p\ge 3$. My approach is as follows: if $\phi$ denotes the $p$-power Frobenius morphism, then $P\in E(\Bbb F_p)$ if and only if $\phi(P)=P$. Therefore $\# E(\Bbb F_p)=\#\ker(1-\phi)$, which because $1-\phi$ is separable is equal to $\deg(1-\phi)$. I have therefore reduced my problem to showing $\deg(1-\phi)$ is divisible by $4$. To do this, I would like to use the more general fact that if $\psi$ is an endomorphism of $E$, and we let $\psi_{\ell}$ denote the induced endomorphism on the Tate module $T_{\ell}(E)$ for any prime $\ell$ not equal to the characteristic, then we have $$\deg(\psi)=\det(\psi_{\ell}).$$ I would like to apply this to our case, when $\psi=1-\phi$ and $\ell=2$. So then I just need to calculate $\det((1-\phi)_2)$. I don't know a good way to do this though, as I'm not sure how to get an explicit $\Bbb Z_{\ell}$-basis of $T_{\ell}(E)\cong\Bbb Z_{\ell}\times\Bbb Z_{\ell}$ (the proof of the latter isomorphism was very non-constructive). I don't even know how to give any explicit points of $E(\Bbb F_p)$ besides $O$, as it relies on $x^3+x$ being a quadratic residue modulo $p$. Does anybody have any suggestions on how to proceed?

I ask because secretly I'm thinking $X_k=G$ is an algebraic group over $k$, so that the existence one regular point, by homogeneity, implies all points are regular (justifying the name variety). Not being well versed in modern AG, I'm having trouble interpolating between the approaches of classical varieties over algebraically closed fields and the scheme theoretic approach taken, for example, in these notes. For a  classical variety $V$ over $k$ (so $k$ is algebraically closed) one shows that the set of regular points is an open dense subset of $V$, hence if one defines an algebraic group on top of this structure it is automatically smooth. However, in the aforementioned notes, they (sec.1 pgs 3-4) define an algebraic group as a finite type $k$-scheme with the added condition of smoothness, where $x$ is a smooth point iff $\mathcal{O}_{{X_{\overline{k}}} ,x}$ is regular, and $X_{\overline{k}}$ is base change to $\overline{k}$. From the notes: Let $G$ be a $k$-group scheme [of finite type]. The group $G(\overline{k})$   acts on $G_{\overline{k}}$ by translation. Now $G$ is smooth if and only if the local   rings of $G_k$ are regular, and over an algebraically closed field it is   enough to check smoothness at the classical points $G_{\overline{k}}(\overline{k}) = G(\overline{k})$. But   by commutative algebra plus the aforementioned “homogeneity”, it is   thus enough to check that the completed local ring $\mathcal{O}_{G_{\overline{k}},e}$ is regular. So my question is: if it's enough to check regularity at classical points, why isn't smoothness immediate? In sections $6$ and $7$ of the notes, a lot of work is put into showing the equivalence between ($\mathcal{O}_{G_{\overline{k}},e}$ is regular) $\iff$ (Grothendieck's infinitesimal criterion for smoothness) which is then put to use to show smoothness of some classical groups like $G=Sp_{2n}$, which amounts to computing the tangent space at $e$ (kernel of $G(k[\epsilon]) \to G(k)$ where $\epsilon^2=0$), and showing the dimension of the tangent space equals the Krull dimension of $G$. This seems like a lot of work for something we get for free with classical varieties, what exactly prevents us from reproducing the density of regular points on scheme theoretic varieties? If it is an issue with the ground field, could I avoid all this work if I just assumed $k$ to be a perfect field or characteristic $0$? i.e. is this lemma from Stacks enough? I'm not sure because the lemma requires varieties to be reduced, so I'm not sure how all these subtly different definitions play out. If that lemma fails for non-perfect ground fields, I would still be interested in seeing an example of a finite type group scheme over $k$ without regular points, i.e. a non-smooth group, or a scheme $X$ in general.","Recall that $x$ is regular point if the local ring $\mathcal{O}_{x}$ is a regular local ring.

Version 2 of Question (Unnecessary to Read) $\newcommand{\div}{\operatorname{div}_{V(P)} }$ This question is based on Exercise 3.5.15 in Algebraic Geometry: A Problem Solving Approach by Garrity, Belshof, et al. Let $$ L(D) := \{ F \in \mathscr{K}(V(P)): F = 0\ \text{ or }\div(F) + D \ge 0 \} $$ ( see here , for example). If I have that $F, G \in L(D)$ , how do I show that $F+G \in L(D)$ ? This is necessary to show that $L(D)$ is a vector space and thus that the statement of the Riemann-Roch theorem makes sense. Another way to phrase this: How can one show that, where $I_p(\dots)$ denotes the intersection multiplicity at $p \in \mathbb{CP}^2$ , $$I_p(V(f_2 g_1 + f_1 g_2) \cap V(P)) - I_p(V(f_2 g_2) \cap V(P)) \ge \\ \min\{ I_p(V(f_1) \cap V(P))-I_p(V(f_2) \cap V(P)),\quad I_p(V(g_1) \cap V(P)) - I_p(V(g_2)\cap V(P))  \}?$$ Probably it is a corollary of Bezout's theorem somehow? Page 2 of this document [Proposition 1.7 (i)] says that closure under addition follows from the fact that $v_p (F+G) \ge \min\{ v_p(F), v_p(G) \}$ for any $F,G \in \mathscr{K}(V(P))$ and any $p \in V(P)$ . However I do not understand either why this is true or why it ""should"" be true. $v_p$ is supposed to denote something about ""valuation"" or ""discrete valuation"", I am not sure, since I have not taken a course in commutative algebra yet, it seems to be related to this , but there it is given as an axiom -- I am not sure how to show that the order of a zero/pole of a rational function is a ""discrete valuation"", although that seems to be what this comes down to. This page also makes the same claim (that the order of poles/zeros is a discrete valuation on a rational function field). Version 1 of Question (Unnecessary to Read) I get that the Riemann-Roch space is a subset of the complex vector space of rational functions (see my previous question ), therefore all I need to show is that it is closed under scalar multiplication and addition. The proof that it is closed under scalar multiplication is easy: $0 \in L(D)$ by definition, and for any $\lambda \in \mathbb{C} \setminus \{0 \}$ one has that $\div(\lambda F) = \div(F)$ where $F \in \mathscr{K}(V(P))$ . Question: How can one show that $L(D)$ is closed under addition? However, I do not understand at all how to show that it is closed under addition. I know that $\div(FG)=\div(F)+\div(G)$ (and that $\div(F^{-1})=-\div(F)$ ), but this doesn't tell me anything I need to know about $\div(F + G)$ . Specifically, if $F= \frac{f_1}{f_2}, G= \frac{g_1}{g_2}$ , then $$F+G = \frac{g_2 f_1 + f_2 g_1 }{f_2 g_2}.$$ What can we say about the zeros of the sum of two distinct polynomials? This is apparently a non-trivial issue, see e.g. https://mathoverflow.net/questions/30072/roots-of-sum-of-two-polynomials , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022247X02000458 1. As far as I can tell (and I am probably incorrect), the zero set of $g_2f_1 + f_2g_1$ , denoted $V(g_2 f_1 + f_2 g_1)$ , is equal to $$V(g_2 f_1) \cap V(f_2 g_1). $$ Note that I am using intersection in the sense of generalized multisets, where an element can not only occur multiple times (a zero with multiplicity), but also appear negatively many times (a pole). I can not figure out a simple way to translate intersection into the arithmetic of divisors. For instance, if $D_1$ corresponded to $V(a)\cap V(P)$ and $D_2$ corresponded to $V(b) \cap V(P)$ , then $D_1 + D_2$ would correspond to $(V(a)\cap V(P))\cup(V(b) \cap V(P))= (V(a) \cup V(b)) \cap V(P)$ , i.e. the addition of divisors corresponds to the union of zero sets and pole sets and thus to the multiplication of rational functions. Since multiplication between divisors is undefined, nothing seems to correspond to the intersection of zero and pole sets, and thus to the addition of rational functions. (My thinking in terms of indicator functions due to exposure to probability theory may be hampering me here; however, it is supposedly a natural way to understand multisets .) 2. This webpage here says that closure under addition should follow immediately from the fact $$\div(F +G) \ge \min \{ \div(F) + \div(G)  \} $$ (specifically they use a term by term comparison for each point $p$ ). However, I don't see at all how this fact is true, or why it should be true. In fact, I would expect an inequality in the other direction to hold, since $V(a) \cap V(b) \subset V(a), V(a) \cap V(b) \subset V(b)$ . Defintions: $V(P) \subset \mathbb{CP}^2$ means the zero set of a homogeneous polynomial. I would suppose that in particular the $V$ stands for ""variety"". $F$ and $G$ are (equivalence classes of) rational functions in the field of rational functions $\mathscr{K}(V(P))$ corresponding to $V(P)$ . $D$ denotes a divisor. $\div (F)$ denotes the divisor generated by the function $F \in \mathscr{K}(V(P))$ with respect to $V(P)$ ; specifically if $F =\frac{f_1}{f_2}$ , where $f_1$ and $f_2$ are homogeneous polynomials of the same degree, then $$\div (F) = \sum_{p \in V(f_1) \cap V(P)} n_p p  -\sum_{p \in V(f_2) \cap V(P)} n_p p  $$ where $n_p$ is the order/multiplicity of the zero of $f_1$ , $f_2$ respectively -- note of course that zeroes of $f_2$ correspond in particular to poles of $F$ . Finally, $L(D)$ , which I think is sometimes called a ""Riemann-Roch space"", is the set of functions in $\mathscr{K}(V(P))$ defined to be $$L(D) := \{ F \in \mathscr{K}(V(P)): F = 0 \quad or \quad \div(F) + D \ge 0 \} $$","Let denote a curve, i.e. a smooth projective variety of dimension one, over , and let denote the corresponding field of rational functions on .

To a $G$-set $Z$ we associate the representable sheaf $h_Z = \text{Hom}_G (-, Z)$ and to a sheaf $F$ we associate the set $F(G)$ made into a left $G$-set by applying $F$ to the right-multiplication of $G$ on itself. It is easy to see that $$ Z\mapsto h_Z \mapsto h_Z (G) = \text{Hom}_G (G, Z)$$ gives a natural isomorphism in one direction of the equivalence. The thing I'm struggling with is the other direction: showing that $$ F \cong \text{Hom}_G (-, F(G))$$ naturally in $F$. To set things up specifically for my problem, let $U$ be a $G$-set and let $u\in U$. Define $\phi_u : G\to U$ by $\phi_u (g) = g\cdot u$. Then $\phi_u$ is a $G$-map and $\left\{\phi_u : G\to U\right\}_{u\in U}$ is a covering family in $T_G$.

56,Computing the Picard group of Number Fields in analogy with genus $0$ curves,Computing the Picard group of Number Fields in analogy with genus  curves,0,"It is possible to compute the Picard group of (some? all?) genus $0$ curves in the following manner: For concreteness let, $A = k[x,y]/(x^2+y^2-1)$ and $X = \operatorname{Spec} A$. Let $Y$ denote $\operatorname{Proj} k[x,y,z]/(x^2+y^2-z^2)$. Let $k$ be any field for now. Then, either by general theory or by explicit computation, we can find an isomorphism $\pi: Y \to \mathbb P^1$. Now $X$ is an open subscheme of $Y$ that either misses two degree one points or one degree two points depending on whether $k$ contains $\sqrt{-1}$. By the above isomorphism, we know that $\operatorname{Pic} Y = \operatorname{Pic} \Bbb P^1 = \Bbb Z$. The Picard group is easily seen to be isomorphic to the Class groups in this case and the excision sequence gives us the following: $$G \to \operatorname{Cl} Y \to \operatorname{Cl} X \to 0$$ where $G = \Bbb Z$ or $\Bbb Z\oplus \Bbb Z $ depending on whether $X$ misses one point or two. This lets us compute the class group of $X$ and it turns out to be either trivial or $\Bbb Z/2$. The analogy: I believe there is some sort of strong analogy between $A$ and $\Bbb Z[\sqrt{-5}]$ when $k$ does not contain $\sqrt{-1}$. For instance, I think both rings are not UFD's ""only"" because of the factorizations: $$x^2 = (1-y)(1+y), 2\times 3 = (1+\sqrt{-5})(1+\sqrt{-5})$$ where $x$ is roughly equivalent to $2/3$ and $y$ is $\sqrt{-5}$. Both factorizations seem to occur because we can write a square as a difference of two squares($5 = 3^2-2^2$.) Questions: Can one make this analogy precise? Does it extend to other genus $0$ curves/(quadratic?) number fields? What about higher genus? If one can make this analogy precise, does the above method also let us compute the Class groups of number fields?

Show that $Y$ is a union of three irreducible components. Describe them and find their prime ideals. I'm aware this problem has been looked at before, but my concern with it is a little different. Specifically, every solution I can see comes up with a different set of prime ideals from the ones I did, and I can't figure out exactly why the ideals I came up with don't work (assuming they don't, which is my intuition based on a vaguely-remembered idea of how the uniqueness of primary decomposition is supposed to work). I agree with the logic of the correct answers I've seen, but I can't figure out whether that means my logic was wrong, and if it does, where the issue is. I'm inclined to start from the direction of algebra, so my reasoning went like this: $Y$ is the zero set of the two given polynomials by definition, so it's the zero set of the ideal generated by them, $(x^2 - yz, xz - x)$. The generating element $x^2-yz$ is irreducible and the other generating element $xz - x$ factors into the irreducibles $x(z - 1)$; since these three elements are irreducible in $k[x, y, z]$ and this ring is a UFD, the ideals generated by them are prime. The product of coprime ideals is the same thing as their intersection, and clearly the product of any pair of these three ideals is coprime to the third one, which means that the product of these three prime ideals is equal to their intersection, and it seems like that should be exactly $(x^2 - yz, x, z - y) = (x^2 - yz, xz - x)$. (I say ""seems like"" because this is the best candidate I have for where my reasoning is incorrect). This ideal is also a radical ideal, since it's an intersection of prime ideals. This means that $I(Y) = (x^2 - yz) \cap (x) \cap (z - 1) = I(Z(x^2 - yz) \cup Z(x) \cup Z(z - 1))$ where each of the three ""Z(ideal)""'s is irreducible since the ideal is prime. Thus $\overline{Y} = Z(I(Y)) = Z(I(Z(x^2 - yz) \cup Z(x) \cup Z(z - 1))) = Z(x^2 - yz) \cup Z(x) \cup Z(z - 1)$, which should finish the problem since $Y$ is defined as an algebraic set, so it's already closed by definition.","From Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometry , exercise 1.3: Let $Y$ be the algebraic set in $\mathbb A^3$ defined by the two polynomials $x^2 - yz$ and $xz - x$.

Specifically, every solution I can see comes up with a different set of prime ideals from the ones I did, and I can't figure out exactly why the ideals I came up with don't work (assuming they don't, which is my intuition based on a vaguely-remembered idea of how the uniqueness of primary decomposition is supposed to work). I agree with the logic of the correct answers I've seen, but I can't figure out whether that means my logic was wrong, and if it does, where the issue is. I'm inclined to start from the direction of algebra, so my reasoning went like this: $Y$ is the zero set of the two given polynomials by definition, so it's the zero set of the ideal generated by them, $(x^2 - yz, xz - x)$. The generating element $x^2-yz$ is irreducible and the other generating element $xz - x$ factors into the irreducibles $x(z - 1)$; since these three elements are irreducible in $k[x, y, z]$ and this ring is a UFD, the ideals generated by them are prime. The product of coprime ideals is the same thing as their intersection, and clearly the product of any pair of these three ideals is coprime to the third one, which means that the product of these three prime ideals is equal to their intersection, and it seems like that should be exactly $(x^2 - yz, x, z - y) = (x^2 - yz, xz - x)$. (I say ""seems like"" because this is the best candidate I have for where my reasoning is incorrect). This ideal is also a radical ideal, since it's an intersection of prime ideals. This means that $I(Y) = (x^2 - yz) \cap (x) \cap (z - 1) = I(Z(x^2 - yz) \cup Z(x) \cup Z(z - 1))$ where each of the three ""Z(ideal)""'s is irreducible since the ideal is prime. Thus $\overline{Y} = Z(I(Y)) = Z(I(Z(x^2 - yz) \cup Z(x) \cup Z(z - 1))) = Z(x^2 - yz) \cup Z(x) \cup Z(z - 1)$, which should finish the problem since $Y$ is defined as an algebraic set, so it's already closed by definition.",,"['abstract-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra', 'ideals', 'zariski-topology']"

95,Equivalence relation on regular functions,Equivalence relation on regular functions,,"In this problem, consider $K$ an algebraic closed field and $X\subset\mathbb{A}^n_k$ an irreducible variety. Given an open Zariski $U\subset X$, we say that a function $\phi:U\rightarrow K$ is regular if $\phi = f/g$ for some $f,g\in K[x_1,\ldots, x_n]$ (in this case, $g$ is never zero in $U$). Now, the problem: fix $p\in X$, consider two open Zariski $U,V$ containing $p$ and two regular functions $\phi:U\rightarrow K$, $\psi:V\rightarrow K$. We can define a relation $(\phi, U)\sim (\psi,V)$ when there is an open Zariski $W\subset U\cap V$ such that $\phi=\psi$ in $W$. I want to prove that this relation is an equivalence relation. It's not hard to prove reflexivity and symmetry, but the transitivity is hard. Suppose $(\phi, U)\sim (\psi,V)$ and $\varphi:T\rightarrow K$ such that $(\psi, V)\sim (\varphi,T)$. I know there is some open Zariski $Z\subset V\cap T$ such that $\psi = \varphi$ in $Z$. Also I know that $p$ is inside $U,V,T$, but this doesn't guarantees that $U$ and $T$ have non empty intersection. Even if the intersection is non empty, I can't see why would exist an open Zariski inside $U\cap T$, so I'm stuck here. If is not to ask too much, I have another question. Why can't I just take $W=U\cap V$ when defining this relation? Thanks.","In this problem, consider $K$ an algebraic closed field and $X\subset\mathbb{A}^n_k$ an irreducible variety.
