In how many ways can this assignment of 11 students be accomplished? [Edit: As I recall,] the answer provided was: $11 \choose 3$ + $8 \choose 6$ + $2 \choose 2$ = 194 What I don't understand is why order matters in choosing how many students are assigned to each dorm.  That is, why should the answer be different if 6 students are chosen for the first room and 3 chosen for the second?",,"['combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics']"

We were given the basic formulation of the problem using set theory (A $\cup$ B $\cup$ C), and then launched into examples. I failed to see in any of the examples how it related to set theory, and he seemed to want us to learn through pattern matching (which has left me very confused). An example of this: How many ways are there to assign five different jobs to four different employees if every employee is assigned at least one job? $4^5$ - $\binom{4}{1}$$3^5$ + $\binom{4}{2}$$2^5$ - $\binom{4}{3}$$1^5$ He talked us through this somewhat, but I couldn't understand how or why it worked.

I realized that the total number of subsets of S is just: $ \binom{n}{1} + \binom{n}{2} + \cdots + \binom{n}{n} + 1$ And so I put together the cool looking formula $ \displaystyle \sum_{r=1}^n \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} = 2^n - 1$ But I have no clue how to approach proving this formula analytically. Any help? So if I try a proof by induction: $\displaystyle \sum_{r=1}^n \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} = 2^n - 1$ $\displaystyle \sum_{r=0}^n \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} = 2^n$ obviously true for $n = 1$: $1 + \frac{1}{1!0!} = 2 = 2$ assume true for $n$, I could multiply both sides by $2$? $\displaystyle 2\sum_{r=0}^n \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} = 2^{n+1}$ How could I go about proving that $\displaystyle 2\sum_{r=0}^n \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}  = \sum_{r=0}^{n+1} \frac{(n+1)!}{r!((n+1) - r)!}$","Student here!
