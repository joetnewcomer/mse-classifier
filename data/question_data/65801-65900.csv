We have already proved that FPPs of order $q$ have $q^2+q+1$ lines and points (if that is relevant). Take the linear space $\Bbb{Z}_p^3$, and consider the one dimensional subspaces. Notice that there are $(p^3-1)/(p-1)=p^2+p+1$ such subspaces. Let $n=p^2+p+1$, and let $P_1,\ldots,P_n$ be the subspaces, and $w_i\in P_i$ be any vector in each. Let $X_i$ be the $2$-dimensional subspace of $\Bbb{Z}_p^3$ containing $x\in\Bbb{Z}_p^3$ such that $w_i^\top x=0$. The line $L_i$ is formed by the points $P_j$ such that $P_j\subseteq X_i$.

If this proof is true then why is this not true for every positve integer $p$?","I came across a combinatorial proof of the Fermat's Little Theorem which states that If $p$ is a prime number then the number ($a$ $p$ -$a$) is a multiple of $p$ for any natural number $a$. Let me write down the proof. PROOF We have pearls of $a$ colours . From these we make necklaces of exactly $p$ pearls . First,we make a string of pearls . There are $a$ $p$ different strings.If we throw away  the $a$ one one -coloured pearls  ($a$ $p$ -$a$) strings will remain.We connect the ends of each string to get necklaces.We find that two strings that differ only by a cyclic permutation of its pearls result in indistinguishable necklaces.But there are $p$ cyclic permutations of $p$ pearls on a string . Hence the number of distinct necklaces is    [($a$ $p$ -$a$)/$p$]. Because of this interpretation this is an integer.Thus ($a$ $p$ -$a$) is a multiple of $p$ for any natural number $a$. [HENCE PROVED] MY CONFUSIONS What is the use of the fact that $p$ is a prime in this proof?

My reasoning and answer for the following question are as follows: Since there must be $5$ lower case characters and $2$ digits the password is $7$ characters long: X-X-X-X-X-X-X For part (a) repetitions are allowed. Therefore there are $26^5$ lowercase characters that we can pick,  $10^2$ digits that we may pic.

The $5$ lowercase characters may be placed in $5$ of the $7$ slots $7C5 = 21$ ways. We don't need to do the calculation for the digits into the two remaining slots because they will automatically fall into the two remaining places.
