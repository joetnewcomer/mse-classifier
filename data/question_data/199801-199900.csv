Then its image $f(M)$ can be equipped with a structure of an immersed submanifold of $N$ , that is a topology and a smooth structure making the canonical inclusion $f(M) \hookrightarrow N$ into a smooth injective immersion. Some people even say that with respect to this $f: M \rightarrow f(M)$ becomes a surjective submersion. This I do not believe, as this would mean that every smooth map of constant rank can be written as a composition of a smooth surjective submersion followed by a smooth injective immersion, which is not (people say) true for global manifolds. !!Edit:!! Maybe it is true that every subimmersion (and thus also a map of constant rank) is actually always a composition of a submersion followed by an immersion. I have found this both in Bourbaki (Book X, section about subimmersions) or in super-detailed exposition in the book: https://books.google.cz/books?id=G8nDGS5RfjQC See Proposition 5.2.7 there. Maybe this somehow does not apply here as they consider a bigger class of smooth manifolds (namely, they do not force them to be Hausdorff and second countable). In particular, they use the manifold of germs of submanifolds, as does Bourbaki. Edit 2: Bourbaki et al say that subimmersion is a composition of submersion followed by immersion. However, they do not say that submersion is surjective and immersion injective. Hence it is useless here. I have tried two approaches, both in a sense using the constant rank theorem. Attempt 1 : This uses the rank theorem directly. Let $n = \dim(M)$ , $k = \dim(N)$ and $r = rank(f)$ . Then, for every $m \in M$ , there exist coordinate charts $(U,\varphi)$ and $(V,\psi)$ for $M$ and $N$ , respectively, such that (i) $m \in U$ , $\varphi(U) = W \times W'$ , where $W \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{r}$ , $W' \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n-r}$ are open sets and $\varphi(m) = (0,0)$ . (ii) $f(U) \subseteq V$ , $\psi(V) = W \times W''$ , where $W \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{r}$ , $W'' \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{k-r}$ are open and $\psi(f(m)) = (0,0)$ . (ii) The local form $\hat{f} = \psi \circ f \circ \varphi^{-1}$ in these coordinates has the form \begin{equation}\hat{f}(x,y) = (x,0), \text{ for all } (x,y) \in W \times W'.\end{equation} The idea is to directly use these coordinates to define the coordinate atlas on $f(M)$ . Namely, consider the sets $U_{0} := f(U)$ together with a map $\psi_{0}: U_{0} \rightarrow W$ which is obtained from $\psi$ by restricting it to $f(U)$ . This makes sense as $\psi(f(U)) = W \times \{0\}$ . Suppose there is another such defined chart, say $\psi'_{0}: U'_{0} \rightarrow Z$ , which is obtained from some local charts $(U',\varphi')$ and $(V',\psi')$ having the properties (i) - (iii) where we replace the open sets $W,W',W''$ with $Z,Z',Z''$ , such that $U_{0} \cap U'_{0} \neq \emptyset$ . In order to say something about the transition maps between these two charts, one would have to prove that $\psi'_{0}(U_{0} \cap U'_{0})$ and $\psi_{0}(U_{0} \cap U'_{0})$ are open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^{r}$ , This is where I fail and I even doubt that this is true in general. If one would be able to prove this, it is then easy to see that the transition maps are smooth and the composition $\psi \circ I \circ \psi_{0}^{-1}$ is just inclusion $x \mapsto (x,0)$ , hence $I$ is a smooth injective immersion. Remark 1: This construction in fact should fail, as the composition $\psi_{0} \circ f \circ \varphi^{-1}$ is the projection $(x,y) \mapsto x$ , hence $f: M \rightarrow f(M)$ a smooth surjective submersion. This would contradict the above observation that not every smooth map of constant rank can be decomposed as a smooth surjective submersion followed by a smooth injective immersion. Remark 2: If $f$ is assumed open or closed, the statement is true. In fact, then $f(M)$ is an embedded submanifold of $N$ . This is because (say if $f$ is open) the sets $f(U) \cap V$ together with the restriction of $\psi$ work as submanifold charts for $f(M)$ . Attempt 2: Here I will be brief, as I in fact suspect it to be just the first paragraph in disguise. Every map $f$ of constant rank is so called subimmmersion , each point $m \in M$ has a neighborhood $U$ , such that there exists a smooth manifold $M$ and a pair of maps $h: U \rightarrow P$ and $g: P \rightarrow N$ , such that $f|_{U} = g \circ h$ and (i) $h$ is a smooth surjective submersion, (ii) $g$ is a smooth injective immersion. The idea is now to equip $f(U) = g(P)$ with a smooth structure and topology by declaring it diffeomorphic to $P$ . To finish, one would have to prove that on overlaps $f(U) \cap f(U')$ , the induced smooth structures would be compatible. To my understanding, one would have to prove that the sets $g^{-1}(f(U'))$ and $g'^{-1}(f(U))$ would have to be shown diffeomorphic. Yet it is not clear that they are even open in $P$ and $P'$ , respectively. Any suggestions? I would be happy to read it in the literature, yet I have not found anything reasonable (usually, only level manifolds for constant rank maps are examined, or they do not like immersed submanifolds at all).

Attempt 2: Here I will be brief, as I in fact suspect it to be just the first paragraph in disguise. Every map of constant rank is so called subimmmersion , each point has a neighborhood , such that there exists a smooth manifold and a pair of maps and , such that and (i) is a smooth surjective submersion, (ii) is a smooth injective immersion. The idea is now to equip with a smooth structure and topology by declaring it diffeomorphic to . To finish, one would have to prove that on overlaps , the induced smooth structures would be compatible. To my understanding, one would have to prove that the sets and would have to be shown diffeomorphic. Yet it is not clear that they are even open in and , respectively. Any suggestions? I would be happy to read it in the literature, yet I have not found anything reasonable (usually, only level manifolds for constant rank maps are examined, or they do not like immersed submanifolds at all).

98,two points of the longest distance in a convex curve will be the vertices?,two points of the longest distance in a convex curve will be the vertices?,,"First we give the necessary definition: A vertex of a curve $\gamma(r)$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is a point where its signed curvature $\boldsymbol{k}_{s}$ has a stationary point, i.e.,where $d\boldsymbol{k}_{s}/dt=0$. We have Four Vertex Theorem: Every convex simple closed curve in $\mathbb{R}^2$ has at least four vertices. Now, I have a question： For a convex curve on $\mathbb{R}^2$ plane, we define the distance of two points $(x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2)$ on the curve is $L=\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2 +(y_1-y_2)^2}$. If the distance of these two points is the longest on $\gamma(r)$, would these two points will be vertices?
