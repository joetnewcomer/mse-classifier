21,Is it possible to define a function $f$ from positive real to positive real such that $f(f(x)) = {1 \over x}$,Is it possible to define a function  from positive real to positive real such that,f f(f(x)) = {1 \over x},"Is it possible to define a function $f$ , from positive real to positive real such that $f(f(x)) = {1 \over x}$ ? The motivation comes from $1990$ IMO problem $4$ , which one step involves defining such a function over the positive rationals. In the countable rational space one can use the trick that divides numbers into two countable lists and map one to another using different functions. A comment in the video of that problem suggests a new problem: whether the function can be extended to positive real numbers? Basically we need to find a way to partition the reals into two sets and have two functions mapping one set to another set in a bijective way and the composition of the two functions in either order will give ${1 \over x}$ . My thought is this looks impossible but I cannot prove it.","Is it possible to define a function , from positive real to positive real such that ?

I managed to prove that this is not possible unless one of them is zero and the other one is $2001$. The proof was as following: $\sqrt{2001}=\sqrt a+\sqrt b$, $\sqrt{2001}-\sqrt a=\sqrt b$ so $2001+a-2\sqrt{2001a}=b$. This shows that $2\sqrt{2001a}$ is an integer so $2001*a$ is a perfect square. We also know that $2001=3*23*29$ which is a square-free number. so $a$ must divide all of $3,23,29$ which means $a\geq2001$ so$\sqrt a\geq\sqrt{2001}$ and $\sqrt{b}\leq 0$ which means $b=0$. With exact method we can prove that $\sqrt{s}=\sqrt a+\sqrt b$ does not have any natural solutions with $s$ being a square-free number.

The article says that ""Actually, the equation for $z$ gives three complex cube roots for each of the $+$ and $–$ signs, hence six different formulas for $z$ . But when you substitute these in the equation for $y$ , at most three different $y$ values will result, and the last equation will thus give at most three distince [sic] roots $x$ ."" The mention of a $y$ -value can safely be equated to my $x$ -value since I combined the original article's two equations ( $y=z-\frac{p}{3z}$ and $x=y-\frac{b}{3a}$ into a single equation). Thus, according to the very article that this equation was formulated from, when using the formula I should get 6 $z$ -values, but upon plugging these into my second equation to solve for $x$ , I should see only 3 distinct $x$ -values. When I test this, however, with the cubic $-2x^3+3x^2-x+5=0$ , which has solutions 1.92, -0.21-1.12 $i$ , and -0.21+1.12 $i$ , I get the following: $$z_1=1.399 \therefore x_1=1.901$$ $$z_2=-0.67+1.16i \therefore x_2=-0.2+1.11i$$ $$z_3=-0.67-1.16i \therefore x_3=-0.2-1.11i$$ $$z_4=0.461 \therefore x_4=1.142$$ $$z_5=-0.23+0.4i \therefore x_5=0.18+0.24i$$ $$z_6=-0.23-0.4i \therefore x_6=0.18-0.24i$$ Note that $z_1$ , $z_2$ , and $z_3$ all came from using a $+$ sign for the $\pm$ input in the equation for $z$ (the complex solutions came from multiplying the real solution by $e^\frac{2i\pi}{3}$ and $e^\frac{4i\pi}{3}$ ). Coincidentally (or not) only these 3 $z$ -values gave correct (though somewhat off due to lazy rounding) $x$ -values. The $z$ -values derived by using a $-$ sign for the $\pm$ input ( $z_4$ , $z_5$ , and $z_6$ ), however, did not yield correct $x$ -values. More crucially, the prediction the article made that the 6 $z$ -values would collapse into only 3 $x$ -values when plugged into the second equation did not come true. This has left me with really nowhere to go.

98,How do you solve $[x]+[2x]+[3x]=4x$ on $\Bbb R$?,How do you solve  on ?,[x]+[2x]+[3x]=4x \Bbb R,"Find the arithmetic average of all solutions $x\in\Bbb R$ of the equation $$[x]+[2x]+[3x]=4x,$$ where $[x]$ denotes the integer part of $x$ (e.g. $[2.5]=2$ , $[-2.5]=-3$ ). I tried solving this problem by looking at $\{x\}$ and writing for example $[2x]$ as $2[x]$ when $\{x\}<1/2$ and $2[x]+1$ when $\{x\}\ge1/2$ . This lead to a lot of cases and after half an hour I literally couldn't go on any longer. I was thinking maybe I can somehow find the arithmetic average without actually knowing the solutions, but couldn't find any way to do that. Any help would be appreciated. :) Thanks!","Find the arithmetic average of all solutions of the equation where denotes the integer part of (e.g. , ).
