So please help me understand if what I assume here is correct: $R$ = $\sum$(review of item $X$ * ratingvalue) / (total reviews of item $X$) $v$ = total reviews of item $X$ $m$ = I have only a few reviews on my site right now, so does it matter what number I provide here?  I thought I'd just enter 1 $C$ = which report do they mean by this?  Do they mean the average value of a review across all reviews? Example based on comments below (thanks guys): Let's say I have two movies with the following ratings: Movie A votes: 8,8,10,5,7,8 Movie B votes: 10 Would that result in the following values for the variables: Movie A total reviews: 6 Movie B total reviews: 1 Movie A sum: 46 Movie B sum: 10 Movie A average: 7,666666667 Movie B average: 10 Thus for movie A the variable values would be: R   7,666666667 v   6 m   0,8  <- with value of variable m I could play based on whether this movie relatively has a lot of reviews C   8 And the rating would be: (WR)=(v/(v+m))R+(m/(v+m))C  (WR)=(6/(6+0,8))7,666666667+(0,8/(6+0,8))8  (WR)=7,7 If that's correct: I also tried giving movie A 6*10 and movie B 1*10 but in that case it would make sense to rank movie A higher, which it doesn't with my current formula.

98,How to show $(gf)^{-1} = f^{-1}g^{-1}$? [duplicate],How to show ? [duplicate],(gf)^{-1} = f^{-1}g^{-1},"This question already has answers here : How to prove $(f \circ\ g) ^{-1} = g^{-1} \circ\ f^{-1}$? (inverse of composition) (7 answers) Closed 6 years ago . Suppose that $f:A\rightarrow B$ and $g:B \rightarrow C$ are both one-to-one and onto. Prove that $gf$ is one-to-one and onto. Prove further that $(gf)^{-1} = f^{-1}g^{-1}$. I have already proven the first part, but the second part has always puzzled me. I have tried assuming $x \in (gf)^{-1}$ but that doesn't lead to nowhere. Nor does $x \in (gf)^{-1}(t)$ and showing $x = t$. How to prove?","This question already has answers here : How to prove $(f \circ\ g) ^{-1} = g^{-1} \circ\ f^{-1}$?
