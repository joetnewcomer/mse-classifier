0,Has this subset-sum game been studied?,Has this subset-sum game been studied?,,"Consider the following game: two players, Yolanda (who always goes first) and Zachary, take turns selecting (not yet chosen) numbers between $1$ and $9$.  The first player who can make three of their selected numbers sum to $15$ wins.  This is well-known to be isomorphic to Tic-Tac-Toe (and so in particular, the game is a draw with best play) by mapping numbers to their locations in the $3\times 3$ magic square: $$ \begin{array}{c|c|c} 8 & 1 & 6 \\ \hline 3 & 5 & 7 \\ \hline 4 & 9 & 2 \\ \end{array} $$ Thus, for instance, Yolanda can ensure at least a draw by choosing $5$; and if Zachary replies with some other odd number (say, $7$) then she can win — in this particular instance, by choosing $6$ (forcing Zachary to 'block' with $4$) and then picking $1$ (winning next turn with either $\{1,6,8\}$ or $\{1,5,9\}$).  Of course, if Zachary responds to Yolanda's first move of $5$ with any of the even numbers (i.e., the corner squares) then he can draw. On the other hand, the analogous game where the players choose numbers between $1$ and $10$ (still trying to find a subset of three numbers which sum to $15$) becomes a first-player win: Yolanda can start by choosing $2$, and then choose either $3$ or $5$ based on Zachary's first move.  For instance, if Zachary replies by picking $5$, then Yolanda picks $3$; now Zachary has to pick $10$ to keep her from winning immediately, and Yolanda can choose $4$, winning next move with one of $\{3,4,8\}$ or $\{2,4,9\}$. What I'm wondering is if the generalized version of this game has been studied at all: let two players alternate choosing numbers from $\{1\ldots m\}$ with the goal being to select a subset of size $d$ summing to $N$.  Then there are a lot of natural questions that can be asked: (a) Is there a characterization (even partial) of which particular values $(d,m,N)$ lead to a win for the first player? (b) More particularly: is the game monotonic in $m$?  That is, if the $(d,m_0,N)$ game is a first-player win, is $(d,m,N)$ a first-player win for all $m\geq m_0$?  The usual strategy-stealing arguments show that the game must be either a draw or a first-player win with perfect play (since having an extra number in your 'bin' is never a down side), but at least at first glance it's not clear that a winning strategy on $\{1\ldots m\}$ can't be invalidated back to a draw by the existence of additional counter options when $m$ increases. (c) Is it even the case that for every $d\gt2$ there are some $m$ and $N$ with the $(d,m,N)$ game a first-player win?  (A trivial pairing argument shows that this can never be true for $d=2$.)  It seems like there may be Ramsey arguments here, but I haven't proved it yet. I've skimmed my various CGT references and haven't found anything about this game so far; any pointers would be greatly appreciated.","Consider the following game: two players, Yolanda (who always goes first) and Zachary, take turns selecting (not yet chosen) numbers between $1$ and $9$.

For $n \in \mathbb{N}_0$ let $\mu_\alpha(n)$ be the sum of the indices of the at most $\alpha$ many highest non-zero digits of $n$ in its $q$-adic representation, where the indices begin with 1.

4,Unique representation of a degenerate simplex,Unique representation of a degenerate simplex,,"I recently learned about simplicial sets, and now I'm studying some basic properties. I've learned that every degenerate simplex is a degeneracy of a unique non-degenerate ( nice ) simplex. However, I suspect that the entire representation must also be unique. (This question started as a request for help when I was stuck, but while I was writing the post I figured it out myself, so I end up asking if you could check my proof.) This means, given a nice simplex $x$  and $$\large z = s_{j_n}\cdots s_{j_1}x = s_{i_n}\cdots s_{i_1}x, \qquad 0\le j_1 <\cdots <j_n, \;\; 0\le i_1 <\cdots< i_n $$ does this imply that $j_k=i_k$ for all $k$? If $s_j x = s_i x,\ i<j$, for a simplex $x$, then  $$\large x = d_i s_i x = d_i s_j x = s_{j-1} d_i x $$ So if $x$ is nice, then $s_j x \ne s_k x$. This can be seen as the induction start. Assume that the claim is true for $n$.  Let's first consider the case $j_{n+1} > i_{n+1}+1$. If we apply $d_{j_{n+1}}$ to both sides, we get $$\large d_{j_{n+1}} z = s_{j_n} \cdots s_{j_1} x =  s_{i_{n+1}} \cdots s_{i_n}d_{j_{n+1}-n-1} x  $$ which means that $d_{j_{n+1}} z$ is degeneracy of $x$ and of $d_{j_{n+1}} x$, but then $d_{j_{n+1}}x$ has to be a degeneracy of $x$. We can conclude that  $j_{n+1}\in\{i_{n+1},i_{n+1}+1\}$. Clearly, $j_{n+1} = i_{n+1}$ implies by induction that $j_k = i_k$ for all $k$. But what if $j_{n+1}=i_{n+1}+1$?

So $d_{i_{n+1}}s_{j_n}$ must vanish, and we can use the induction hypothesis to conclude  that $i_n = i_{n+1}$, which is a contradiction. Is this proof correct? And can it be simplified?

9,Into how many parts do $n$ ellipsoids divide $\mathbb{R}^{3}$?,Into how many parts do  ellipsoids divide ?,n \mathbb{R}^{3},"What is the maximum number of regions into which $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ can be divided by $n$ ellipsoids? (Each ellipsoid has the same size). Let´s denote this number by $r_{n}$. Clearly $r_{1}=2$. But even with two ellipsoids things get complicated: Certainly $r_{2}\ge 6$ (e.g. $x^2+(y/2)^2+z^2$ and $x^2+y^2+(z/2)^2$), and I think that 6 is the maximum. Note that $r_{3}\ge 14$ because it is possible to draw three ellipses dividing the plane into 14 regions. More generally $$r_{n}\ge 2n^{2}-2n+2,$$  since $n$ ellipses divide the plane into at most $2n^{2}-2n+2$ regions, and this happens if and only if any two ellipses intersect in 4 points and any three have empty intersection (Check this , and also this post has a related question). Note that $n$ circles (resp. ellipses) (resp. equilateral triangles) divide the plane into at most $n^2-n+2$ (resp. $2n^2-2n+2$) (resp. $3n^2-3n+2$) regions. Note that for $n\ge 1$ $n^2-n+2\le 2n^2-2n+2\le 3n^2-3n+2$. It seems that this situation generalizes to higher dimensions.

Some three consecutive numbers sum to at least $32$ Integers $1, 2, \ldots, 10$ are circularly arranged in an arbitrary order. Consider the first $n$ positive integers distributed along a circle in an arbitrary order. There are a total of $(n-1)!$ arrangements. Pick an arrangement $P_m$, where $m \in \{1,2,\ldots,(n-1)!\}$ The arrangement $P_m$ is of the form $a_{m,1},a_{m,2},\ldots,a_{m,n}$ around the circle where $a_{m,j} \in \{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ and $a_{m,i} \neq a_{m,j}$ whenever $i \neq j$. Define a $k$-sum as the sum of $k$ consecutive numbers in an arrangement $P_m$.

Clearly for any arrangement $P_m$, there are $n$ such $k$-sums. Now look at the maximum of these $k$-sums in the arrangement $P_m$, i.e. $$s_{m,k} = \max \{ (a_{m,1} + a_{m,2} + \cdots + a_{m,k}),(a_{m,2} + a_{m,3} + \cdots + a_{m,k+1}), \cdots,  (a_{m,n} + a_{m,1} + \cdots + a_{m,k-1})\}$$ The question is what is the optimal lower bound of this maximum sum? i.e. What is $\displaystyle \min_{m} s_{m,k}$? In Integers $1, 2, \ldots, 10$ are circularly arranged in an arbitrary order. it is shown that for $n=10$ and $k=3$, the optimal lower bound is $18$ and in Some three consecutive numbers sum to at least $32$ , it is shown that the optimal lower bound for $n=20$ and $k=3$ is $\geq 33$. Clearly, for $k=1$, $\displaystyle \min_{m} s_{m,1} = n$. For $k=2$, $\displaystyle \min_{m} s_{m,2} = n+2$. In general, a trivial lower bound is obtained by adding up all the $n$, '$k$' sums to get that $$n \times \min_{m} s_{m,k} \geq k \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$ i.e. $\displaystyle \min_{m} s_{m,k} \geq \left \lceil k \frac{(n+1)}{2} \right \rceil$.

95,What's the number of decibinary numbers that evaluate to given decimal number?,What's the number of decibinary numbers that evaluate to given decimal number?,,"Let's define a decibinary number system, where each bit (or digit) can range from $0$ to $9$ , but it's place value corresponds to the one in the binary system. For example: $$(2020)_{decibinary} = 2 \times 2^3 + 0 \times 2^2 + 2 \times 2^1 + 0 \times 2^0 = 16 + 2 = (18)_{10}$$ Note, that many decibinary numbers can evaluate to the same decimal value, e.g. $$(1220)_{decibinary} = 1 \times 2^3 + 2 \times 2^2 + 2 \times 2^1 + 0 \times 2^0 = 8 + 8 + 2  = (18)_{10}$$ I am looking for an expression (say function $f$ ) or an efficient algorithm, that, given a decimal number $n$ , gives me a number of decibinary numbers that evaluate to $n$ . Of course I am treating e.g. $(05)_{decibinary}$ the same as $(5)_{decibinary}$ (leading zeros do not matter). As an aside, I found the concept of decibinary numbers in this HackerRank question , where I thought it might actually be useful to be able to quickly compute $f(n)$ to solve the problem efficiently. $$\\$$ Below are my thoughts and approaches to tackle the problem. What I tried was to first see if there is a pattern: $$f(0) = 1 \\ f(1) = 1 \\ f(2) = 2 \\ f(3) = 2 \\ f(4) = 4 \\ f(5) = 4 \\ f(6) = 6 \\ f(7) = 6 \\ f(8) = 10 \\ f(9) = 10 \\ f(10) = 13$$ but $10$ seems to break the pattern, as there are (if I didn't skip anything) $13$ decibinary numbers that evaluate to $(10)_{10}$ : $18, 26, 34, 42, 50, 106, 114, 122, 130, 202, 210, 1002, 1010$ (if it was $14$ I could see some pattern, but unfortunately $10$ cannot be encoded using one digit in decibinary ). What I spotted, however, is that I could recursively calculate $f$ (or use dynamic programming to build up a lookup table bottom-up in order to be able to reuse the computations). For instance, I know that the decibinary number evaluating to $10$ will have at max. $4$ digits (because $(10000)_{decibinary}$ already evaluates to $16$ ). So I can represent $f(10)$ as a sum of the number of ways I can encode $10$ using $4, 3, 2$ and $1$ digit (the latter being $0$ as there is no way I can represent $10$ using 1 digit). Let's try to compute the number of ways to represent $(10)_{10}$ using $b=4$ digits: The first leading digit can only be $1$ ( $1 \times 2^3$ ), and then, the remaining digits need to evaluate to $10 - 8 = 2$ and we can use the lookup : $f(2) = 2$ . Using $b=3$ digits we can use $1$ and $2$ as non-zero leading digits: $1$ will require a lookup $f(6)$ and $2$ will require a lookup of $f(2)$ , giving a sum of $6 + 2 = 8$ which is false (there are only $6$ ways to encode $10$ using $b=3$ bits) because $6$ itself can be encoded using $b=3$ bits and here I am considering two representations two times instead of one (if this makes sense). It seems to me like the lookup needs to be built such that it does not store $f(n)$ but $f(n, b)$ , i.e. the number of ways to encode $(n)_{10}$ in decibinary using $b$ bits (without a leading zero), which already seems like quite a complex (and inefficient) approach to me. Also each time I'd need to perform a check for a minimum number of bits needed to encode a number (e.g. $10$ cannot be encoded using $b=1$ ). What are your thoughts? Is there a neat and a simple way to find $f(n)$ ?","Let's define a decibinary number system, where each bit (or digit) can range from to , but it's place value corresponds to the one in the binary system.
