4,NBA Draft Pick for Worst Team Probability,NBA Draft Pick for Worst Team Probability,,"This is actually a question from ""A First Course in Probability"" by Sheldon Ross, and I have the solution, but am unclear as to why the solution is the case. Would anyone please clarify? The question is as follows: 11 teams are entered into the NBA draft lottery. A total of 66 balls   are placed in an urn, with the worst team having 11 balls placed, the   second worst team having 10 balls placed, etc (with 1 ball having the   name of the team with the eleventh worst record). A ball is chosen at   random and the team whose name is on the ball is given the first pick   in the draft. Another ball is chosen, and if that ball is different   from the first pick team, that team becomes the second pick team. If   the ball is the same, the ball is discarded and the drawing continues.   This goes on for the first three draft pick teams. After the first three draft pick teams are chosen, the rest of the   teams that did not win the lottery invert their win-loss records and   that order is awarded for draft picks 4 through 11. For example, if   the team with the worst record didn't receive any of the 3 lottery   picks, it becomes the 4th pick. Let X denote the draft pick of the team with the worst record. Find   the probability mass function of X. For P(X = 1), the answer is simply $\frac{11}{16}$. However, for $P(X = 2)$, the solution in the book is $$\sum\limits_{j=2}^{11} \bigl( \frac{12-j}{66} \bigr)\bigl( \frac{11}{54+j} \bigr)$$. This solution doesn't make sense to me, because it doesn't account for the repeated drawing of the same first draft pick team. For example, if the team with 10 balls gets the first draft pick, the second draft pick team would be decided from another draw. If the first pick team is drawn again, that ball is discarded and the process is repeated. So shouldn't the solution account for when, for example, the first draft pick is the second worst team, the second and up to tenth draws are still the second worst team, and the 11th draw (still choosing the 2nd draft pick) is the worst team? Sorry for the long post. I didn't know how else to summarize this.

Hence desired probability $=\frac{1}{4}\times\frac{2}{5}+\frac{1}{4}\times\frac{3}{5}+\frac{1}{4}\times\frac{4}{5}+\frac{1}{4}\times1=\frac{7}{10} = 0.7$ Solution 2 Probability of 4th ball being black when All first first 3 draws are black balls $=\frac{5}{8}\times\frac{4}{7}\times\frac{3}{6}\times\frac{2}{5}=\frac{120}{1680}$ First three draws contain all red balls $=\frac{3}{8}\times\frac{2}{7}\times\frac{1}{6}\times\frac{5}{5}=\frac{30}{1680}$ First three draws contain 2 red and 1 black ball $=\frac{3}{8}\times\frac{2}{7}\times\frac{5}{6}\times\frac{4}{5}\times 3=\frac{360}{1680}$ First three draws contain 1 red and 2 black ball $=\frac{3}{8}\times\frac{5}{7}\times\frac{4}{6}\times\frac{3}{5}\times 3=\frac{540}{1680}$ Summing all above probabilities gives $=\frac{5}{8}=0.625$ I cant decide which one is correct.

28,Polya's random walk and gambler's ruin: interpretation in higher dimensions,Polya's random walk and gambler's ruin: interpretation in higher dimensions,,"I've read that Polya coined the term ""Random Walk."" He analyzed the 1-dimension example and proved that the chances of returning to any point on the line is ultimately 100%. This is how one can think of a gambler's ruin: a person playing a fair random game against a casino will eventually lose all his money. Now, Polya also showed that this scheme breaks down in higher dimensions. For instance, in the 3 dimensional lattice, the player has a lower chance of going back to its starting point (0.34, although I realized in my research that there is no closed form answer for higher dimensions). Question: how can we understand the gambler analogy in the context of Polya's higher dimension examples? Does the case for the 3-dimensional lattice mean that for example somehow playing in 3 casinos with 3 different currencies lowers the risk of ruin? p.s. This is not for gambling.

30,Filtration of Markov Chains in general state space,Filtration of Markov Chains in general state space,,"I am reading the book Markov Chains and Stochastic Stability from Meyn and Tweedie. They define Markov chains on a measurable state space $(E,\Sigma)$ (Chapter 3.4) and they define it on the space $\Omega = \prod_{i \in \mathbb{N}}E, $ with an $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{A}$ which is the smallest $\sigma$-algebra that contains all cylinder sets with only finitly many sets different from $E$ $$A_1 \times A_2 \times \dots A_n \times E \times E \times \dots$$ Then they define the Markov chain as a family of random variables $(X_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ where for $\omega=(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\in \Omega$ they set $$X_n(\omega)=x_n .$$ Thus, all Markov chains are defined on the same set $\Omega$ and the random variables $(X_n)$ are also always the same. Now if they talk about a certain initial distribution $\mu$ and transition kernel $p(x,A)$; then they assoicate a Markov chain to it by constructing a specific measure $\mathbb{P}_\mu$. Thus, by this definition, two Markov chains only differ on the probability measure of the probability space. My problem is that in the book they define the term $$ \mathcal{F}_n = \sigma(X_0,\dots,X_n) \subseteq \mathcal{B}(X^{n+1})$$ and they say which is the smallest $\sigma$-field for which the random variable   $\{X_0,\dots,X_n\}$ is measurable. In many cases $\mathcal{F}_n$ will   coincide with $\mathcal{B}(X^{n+1})$, although this depend in   particular on the initial measure $\mu$ choosen for a particular   chain. How can $\mathcal{F}_n$ depend on the initial measure? The random variable is already defined as $X_n(\omega)=x_n$, and thus the measurability of $\{X_0,\dots,X_n\}$ depends only on $\Sigma$ and $\mathcal{A}$ where does the intial measure $\mu$ comes into play? Update: After seeing the answers, I think it is a good thing to provide my question with an example. Lets consider the case where $E=\{1,2\}$ and $\Omega = E \times E$, then the random variables $X_0$ and $X_1$ are already defined as above, in particular $X_0$ is defined as $$ X_0 ((1,1))=X_0((1,2))=1$$ and $$X_0((2,1))=X_0((2,2))=2.$$  Now if $\mathbb{P}_\mu$ is the probability that $X_0 = 1 $, then we must have $$  \mathbb{P}_\mu[\{(1,1),(1,2)\}]=1.$$ But this is completely independent from  defining $\mathcal{F}_0$ (or $\mathcal{F}_n$). In this case we always have $$\mathcal{F}_0 = \{\{(1,1),(1,2)\},\{(2,1),(2,2)\},E,\emptyset \} $$ which does not depend on $\mu$. It seems to me that in the answers one believes that $\mathbb{P}_\mu[\{(2,1),(2,2)\}]=0$ implies somehow that this set should not belong to $\mathcal{F}_0$, but I think this is not correct.","I am reading the book Markov Chains and Stochastic Stability from Meyn and Tweedie.

The wording is the following Expand the binomials in the probabilities of 0, 1, 2, and 3 occurrences, and show that the expansions cancel out to the next term provided $np \lt 1$. Hence if $np \ll 1$, the first term neglected in the expansion is close to the exact result for 4 or more events. I am assuming that the solution should give something like $\sum_{k = 0}^{3}B(k; n, p) = np + \mathcal{O}\left [(np)^4 \right ]$ but I can't actually get anything that cancels to the first order. Using the recursion relation of Bernouilli trials, $B(k+1; n, p) = \frac{n - k}{k+1}\frac{p}{q}B(k; n,p)$, I get $$(1 - p)^n \left (1 + \frac{np}{q} + \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\frac{p^2}{q^2} + \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6}\frac{p^3}{q^3} \right)$$ Expanding this and keeping the terms 0th and first order in $np$ yields $$(1-p)^n \left (1 - \frac{1}{6}\frac{6 p^3 -29 p^2 + 33 p - 12}{(1-p)^3} + \mathcal{O}\left [(np)^2 \right ]\right )$$ Am I misunderstanding the question? I expected the second term to cancel. Edit: I guess one could use the expansion for $\exp (-np) \approx \left ((1-p)^{\frac{1}{p}} \right )^{-np}$ and then expand it in a Taylor series, $\exp (-np) = 1 - np + \frac{(np)^2}{2} - \frac{(np)^3}{6} + \mathcal{O}\left [(np)^4\right ]$.

The wording is the following Expand the binomials in the probabilities of 0, 1, 2, and 3 occurrences, and show that the expansions cancel out to the next term provided $np \lt 1$. Hence if $np \ll 1$, the first term neglected in the expansion is close to the exact result for 4 or more events. I am assuming that the solution should give something like $\sum_{k = 0}^{3}B(k; n, p) = np + \mathcal{O}\left [(np)^4 \right ]$ but I can't actually get anything that cancels to the first order. Using the recursion relation of Bernouilli trials, $B(k+1; n, p) = \frac{n - k}{k+1}\frac{p}{q}B(k; n,p)$, I get $$(1 - p)^n \left (1 + \frac{np}{q} + \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\frac{p^2}{q^2} + \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6}\frac{p^3}{q^3} \right)$$ Expanding this and keeping the terms 0th and first order in $np$ yields $$(1-p)^n \left (1 - \frac{1}{6}\frac{6 p^3 -29 p^2 + 33 p - 12}{(1-p)^3} + \mathcal{O}\left [(np)^2 \right ]\right )$$ Am I misunderstanding the question? I expected the second term to cancel.

When we roll it, we can be paid the outcome or we can choose to re-roll by paying $1/n$. What is the best strategy and what is the expected value of this game? As an approximation, I thought that to get the maximum value $n$ we need to roll $n$ times. So the best strategy is to roll until we get the maximum value $n$ and the expected value should be $n-1$.

We have two sequences of random variables, $ \{ X_n \}$ and $\{ Y_n \}$, such that each converge in distribution - i.e. there exist random variables $X$ and $Y$ such that: $X_n \rightarrow X$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$ in law, and $Y_n \rightarrow Y$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$ in law. What can we say about the sequence $X_n + Y_n$? I would like to say that it converges in law to $X +Y$ - but is this true? Many apologies if this question has already been asked and answered.

98,Derivation 9.97 in Jaynes' Probability Theory,Derivation 9.97 in Jaynes' Probability Theory,,"In page 298 of Jaynes' Probability Theory: the Logic of Science, equation (9.97), Jaynes says: We expect that, if hypothesis $H$ is true, then $n_k$ will be close to $np_k$ , in the sense that the difference $|n_k-np_k|$ will grow with $n$ only as $\sqrt n$ . Call this 'condition A'. Then using the expansion $\log(x) = (x-1)-(x-1)^2/2+...$ , we find that $$\sum_{k=1}^mn_k\log\left[\frac{n_k}{np_k}\right] = \frac 1 2\sum_k\frac{(n_k-np_k)^2}{np_k} + O\left(\frac 1 {\sqrt n}\right)$$ In the above, $\sum_kp_k = 1$ and $\sum_kn_k=n$ , where $n$ is the total number of trials in a series of Bernoulli trials and $n_k$ is the number of trials that had outcome $k$ . I'd like to know how he got from that expansion to the quoted equation, especially given that the squared term in the expansion has negative sign. --EDIT to add info-- Jaynes' nomenclature confused me a bit.
