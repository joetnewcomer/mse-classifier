Then following is equivalent. (i) (Pointwise convergence) For every $x \in X$. $T_n(x)$ converges strongly in $Y$ as $n \to \infty$. (ii) (Pointwise convergence to a continuous limit) There exists a continuous linear map $T:X \to Y$ such that for every $x\in X$, $T_n(x)$ converges strongly in $Y$ to $T(x)$ as $n\to\infty$. (iii) (Uniform boundedness + dense subclass convergence) The operator norms $\{||T_n|| : n = 1, 2, . . .\}$ are bounded, and for a dense set of $x$ in $X$, $T_n(x)$ converges strongly in $Y$ as $n \to \infty$ What I have trouble is $(i) \to (iii)$ and $(iii) \to (ii)$. My proof on $(i) \to (iii)$ is like below; second statement of $(iii)$ is easy so it suffices to prove only boundedness of the set of operator norms. Since convergent sequence is bounded, $\{ T_n(x)\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is clearly bounded sequence. Hence there is some $N $ such that $||T_n(x)|| < N$. Since $T_n$ is linear, $||T_n(x)|| = ||T_n ||_{\mathrm{op}}||x|| < N$, and since $x$ is fixed, $||T_n||_{\mathrm{op}}$ is bounded. Is this argument reasonable? In the Tao's note, he mention Baire category theorem to prove this.But I don't know how to prove this using Baire category theorem directly. For second question, $(iii) \to (ii)$, I have an idea that construct $T:X \to Y$ such that $T(x) =\lim_{n \to \infty} T_n(x)$ and $T(0)=0$. But I know that $T$ is linear and continuous on dense set, but don't know how to extend it to limit point of $X$. Could you give me some hint?","This is from Tao's book; Let $X$ be Banach space, let Y be normed vector space, and let $(T_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be a family of continuous linear operators $T_n : X \to Y$. Then following is equivalent. (i) (Pointwise convergence) For every $x \in X$. $T_n(x)$ converges strongly in $Y$ as $n \to \infty$. (ii) (Pointwise convergence to a continuous limit) There exists a continuous linear map $T:X \to Y$ such that for every $x\in X$, $T_n(x)$ converges strongly in $Y$ to $T(x)$ as $n\to\infty$. (iii) (Uniform boundedness + dense subclass convergence) The operator norms $\{||T_n|| : n = 1, 2, . . .\}$ are bounded, and for a dense set of $x$ in $X$, $T_n(x)$ converges strongly in $Y$ as $n \to \infty$ What I have trouble is $(i) \to (iii)$ and $(iii) \to (ii)$.

98,Direct sum of compact operators is compact,Direct sum of compact operators is compact,,"I have that $T_n$ are bounded operators on $H_n$ ($n\geq 1$) and that $\sup ||T_i||<\infty$. Define $T=\oplus T_n$ and $H=\oplus H_n$. I want to show that $T$ is compact iff $T_n$ is compact for all $n$ and $||T_n||\rightarrow 0$. Here is what I have so far: Assume that $T$ is compact, and let $B_n$ be the unit ball in $H_n$. Then we have that $\overline{T_n(B_n)}$ is a closed subset of $\overline{T(B)}$ (the unit ball in $H$), so we get compactness of $T_n$, and to see that $|T_n|\rightarrow 0$ just note that if the limit didn't go to zero, then for some $\epsilon>0$ there is an infinite subsequence $\{n_i\}$ such that $|T_{n_i}|>\epsilon$. Pick $m$ large, and let $h_{n_i}\in H_{n_i}$ be such that $|T_{n_i}(h_{n_i})|\geq \epsilon$ for $i=1,...,m$. Let $h\in H$ be equal to $h_{n_i}$ in the $n_i$-position and $0$ elsewehere. Then, $|h|=\sqrt{m}$ so $|T(h)/\sqrt{m}|\geq \epsilon \sqrt{m}$, so letting $m\rightarrow\infty$ we get that $T$ is unbounded, a contradiction. For the other direction I am a little stuck, I was thinking of using a theorem that says that for a bounded operator $S$, we have that $S$ is compact iff there is a sequence $S_n$ of operators of finite rank such that $|S-S_n|\rightarrow 0$. Maybe call $S_i$ to be $T_1\oplus...\oplus T_i$, and arguing that $S_i$ has finite rank? I can see that $|T-S_n|\rightarrow 0$ for if $h$ is a unit vector, then  $$|(T-S_n)(h)|=|\sum_{n+1}^\infty T_n(h_n)|\leq \sup_{i\geq n+1}|T_i|\rightarrow 0$$, but I don't know where to use the hypothesis that $\sup |T_n|<\infty$ and how to show that $S_n$ has finite rank.","I have that $T_n$ are bounded operators on $H_n$ ($n\geq 1$) and that $\sup ||T_i||<\infty$.
