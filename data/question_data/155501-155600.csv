0,Particular base-10 digit patterns in Collatz,Particular base-10 digit patterns in Collatz,,"Note: I will use the abbreviation RCF for the Reduced Collatz Function. The arrangement of certain specific digits produce a particular pattern on the next iteration of the Reduced Collatz Function. Before dwelving into the pattern, lets have a recap of the function. The RCF applies only to odd number, and is defined as: $$R(n)=\frac{3n+1}{2^r}$$ where $r$ denotes the largest exponent of the largest power of two that divides $3n+1$ . Denote $i$ as the $i$ 'th iteration of the function. Define also $r$ and $n\in\mathbb{Z_0^+}$ . Lets do some examples (the initial numbers are explicitly chosen): \begin{array}\hline R(23)\to35\to53\to5\to1 \\ R(27)\to...\to395\to593\to... \\ R(359)\to539\to809\to607\to... \\ R(3559)\to5339\to8009\to6007\to... \\ R(35559)\to53339\to80009\to60007\to... \\ \end{array} Note these are just observations of mine. You see the patterns? Digits $3$ , $5$ and $9$ are noticeable. $5$ and $3$ swapped places. $9$ is at the same digit-position. However, in $R^i(n)$ , the digits $9$ and $5$ can't be the first digit or else $R^{i+1}(n)$ will not produce the desired effect. Q: Im sure these patterns have been researched on, any literature about these specifics? When $R^i(n) = 539$ then $n=359$ for $i-1$ . This particular iteration of the function looks like it has an inverse. There might be examples that I am not aware of that work for other numbers but I have not found any. I've seen these numbers in other sequences, namely prime numbers. The following formula gives primes where $n$ is defined by a sequence that can be found here : $$\frac{320\cdot10^n+31}{9}$$ Set $n=7$ This results in the number: $355555559$ . Whatever $n$ we set, the count of $5$ 's between $3$ and $9$ will be same as $n$ . If we put this into the RCF as input? Well we get $R^i(355555559)\to R^{i+1}(533333339)$ . There does not seem to be a relation between the number of digits between $5$ and $9$ and the primes in the collatz function, but the most significant and least significant digit might have? Q: Are there any core math on this subject of the Primes and Collatz? I am open to listen.","Note: I will use the abbreviation RCF for the Reduced Collatz Function.

1,Attaching prime numbers,Attaching prime numbers,,"Yesterday, I was playing around with prime numbers just for amusement and thus became aware that sometimes 'attaching' two prime numbers will result in another prime number. Let me explain my idea by an example. The numbers $3$ and $7$ are prime numbers, and when we write them in succesive order, we obtain the prime number $37$. Similarly, $7$ and $19$ are prime numbers, as well as $719$. There can be found many more such examples. I am wondering if there is some kind of pattern or rule, by which one can see whether attaching two given prime numbers will result in a prime number or not?

My question is: how much smaller is $|\{\frac{a}{b}\}|$ than $|\{(a, b)\}|$, as $N \to \infty$? Here's my approach so far: for any given $b$, we can determine how many $a$s get ""eliminated.""

Put $\mathcal{R}^{+}$ for the series of $\mathcal{R}$ with nonnegative powers of $u$ and $\mathcal{R}^{-}$ for the series with negative powers. The reason I care about $\lambda$ is because I care about the operator $-\lambda u\frac{d}{du}$ over the Robba ring, usually noted $N_{\nabla}$ in literature: for example in Kisin's article ""Crystalline representations and F-crystals."" ) Questions 1. (I gave a negative answer below) In brief, I want to know how big is the image of the operator $-\lambda u \frac{d}{du}$ over the Robba ring modulo $\mathcal{R}^{+}$ : can any element $x\in\mathcal{R}^{-}$ be written in the form $x=-\lambda u\frac{d}{du}(x_1)+x_2$ with $x_1\in \mathcal{R}$ and $x_2\in \mathcal{R}^{+}$ ? If not, a counter example? Remark 1 The difficulty to describe $Im(-\lambda u \frac{d}{du})$ lies in the factor $\lambda$ : without $\lambda$ , $-u\frac{d}{du}$ is very well-behaved. In other words, multiplication by $\lambda$ is mysterious for me. The following questions are what I expect to help approaching an answer. Any remarks or references for any of the big or small questions below are welcomed. 1.opens For me, Robba ring $\mathcal{R}$ is more complicated than a metric space: you have to deal with a series of $r$ -Gauss norm where $r$ takes values in an interval. Is there a reasonable definition of ""(fundamental system of) open neighborhoods of $0$ "" in $\mathcal{R}$ ? Reasonablely, a series is close to $0$ when it is so under all $r$ -Gauss-norm where $r$ takes value in some interval. By the fact $\mathcal{R}_{r}$ is complete for the Fréchet topology, it is a good candidate of closed neighborhood of zero, and it gives a system when $r$ changes: $r_1>r_2$ implies that $R_{r_1}\subset R_{r_2}$ . 1.1 What should a continuous map over the Robba ring look like? 2.radius For a given element $x=\sum_{n\in\mathbf{Z}}a_nu^n\in \mathcal{R}$ , there exists a smallest $0<r<1$ such that for all $\rho\in (r, 1), \sum_{n\in\mathbf{Z}}a_n\rho^{n}$ converges (i.e. $a_n\rho^{n}\to 0$ when $n\to +\infty$ or $n\to -\infty$ ). I want to define $r$ the radius of $x$ . (Is this well-defined?) Now I want to study what operations can influence the radius of an element. For example: Frobenius map ( $\varphi: \sum_{n\in\mathbf{Z}}a_nu^n\mapsto \sum_{n\in\mathbf{Z}}\varphi(a_n)u^{np}$ ) and its inverse map $\psi$ (when it is well-defined) obviously changes the radius. How about other operations, like multiplication by an element? If $x$ has radius $r_1$ and $y$ has radius $r_2$ , can we have a formula for the radius of $xy$ ? Seems pessimistic as for example take any monimal $u^N$ for $N\in \mathbf{N}$ , having ""radius 0"" by our definition, but $u^N \cdot \sum_{n\in\mathbf{Z}}a_nu^n$ doesn't change the radius no matter how big $N$ is. (You really have to be able to change the power of $u^n$ for $n\gg 0$ to change the radius of $x=\sum_{n\in\mathbf{Z}}a_nu^n$ .) So: 2.1 (Less related) Are there results about how $\mathcal{R}_{r_1}\cdot \mathcal{R}_{r_2}\subset \mathcal{R}_{r_3}$ with a formula $r_3=f(r_1, r_2)$ ? (At least, $\mathcal{R}_{r_1}\cdot \mathcal{R}_{r_2}\subset \mathcal{R}_{r_2}$ when $\mathcal{R}_{r_1}\subset \mathcal{R}_{r_2}$ , since it is a ring. ) 2.2 How is $\lambda \cdot x$ changing the radius of $x$ ? 3.image of multiplication by $\lambda$ modulo $\mathcal{R}^{+}$ About the image of multiplication by $\lambda$ (hence more or less $-\lambda u \frac{d}{du}$ ) over the Robba ring: 2.2.1 (Main question) Can you determine what are the elements of $\mathcal{R}$ that can be written of the form $\lambda \cdot x$ for some $x\in\mathcal{R}$ ? 2.2.2 Is the multiplication by an element, for example $\lambda$ a continuous map? (Remark that for any fixed $r$ -Gauss norm it maps Cauchy sequence to Cauchy sequence.) 2.2.3 Does $Im(\cdot \lambda)$ modulo $\mathcal{R}^{+}$ contains an open neighborhood of $0$ ? Remark 2 By some computations, $Im(-\lambda u \frac{d}{du})$ contains $\mathcal{R}_{r}$ modulo $\mathcal{R}^{+}$ for some $r$ close to $1$ and also I see that any finite sum $\sum_{finite}a_nu^n$ is inside $Im(-\lambda u \frac{d}{du})$ modulo $\mathcal{R}^{+}$ . This implies, by a little more computation, that the image is dense inside $\mathcal{R}$ modulo $\mathcal{R}^{+}$ . Hence I expect also some approaches from functional analysis to tell me how big it is. As I observed my previous question has a negative answer, I now change the question as follows: Question 2: Can any element $x\in\mathcal{R}^{-}$ of the form $x=\sum_{i>0, p\nmid > i}a_{-i}u^{-i}$ be written in the form $x=-\lambda > u\frac{d}{du}(x_1)+x_2$ with $x_1\in \mathcal{R}$ and $x_2\in > \mathcal{R}^{+}$ ?

In particular, it appears that there is already a proof for the equivalence $$\sigma(q^{k-1}) \text{ is a square } \iff k = 1.$$ Let $\sigma(x)$ denote the sum of divisors of the positive integer $x$ . Here is my question: If $q$ is prime, can $\sigma(q^{k-1})$ and $\sigma(q^k)/2$ be both squares when $q \equiv 1 \pmod 4$ and $k \equiv 1 \pmod 4$ ? MY ATTEMPT Suppose that $$\sigma(q^{k-1}) = a^2$$ and $$\frac{\sigma(q^k)}{2} = b^2$$ for $q \equiv 1 \pmod 4$ and $k \equiv 1 \pmod 4$ . Since $\sigma(q^k) = q^k + \sigma(q^{k-1})$ , it follows that $$2b^2 = \sigma(q^k) = q^k + \sigma(q^{k-1}) = q^k + a^2.$$ Additionally, congruence-wise we obtain $$a^2 = \sigma(q^{k-1}) \equiv 1 + (k-1) \equiv k \equiv 1 \pmod 4,$$ from which it follows that $a$ is odd, and $$2b^2 = \sigma(q^k) = q^k + \sigma(q^{k-1}) \equiv 1^1 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod 4,$$ which implies that $b$ is likewise odd. Now, using the definition of $\sigma(q^k)$ and $\sigma(q^{k-1})$ for $q$ prime, we derive $$\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{q^{k+1} - 1}{q - 1} = b^2$$ and $$\frac{q^k - 1}{q - 1} = a^2.$$ Assume to the contrary that $$\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{q^{k+1} - 1}{q - 1} = b^2 \leq a^2 = \frac{q^k - 1}{q - 1}.$$ This assumption leads to $$q^{k+1} - 1 \leq 2(q^k - 1)$$ which implies that $$16 = {5^1}(5-2) + 1 \leq q^k(q - 2) + 1 = q^{k+1} - 2q^k + 1 \leq 0,$$ since $q$ is a prime satisfying $q \equiv k \equiv 1 \pmod 4$ .  This results in the contradiction $16 \leq 0$ .  Consequently, we conclude that $a < b$ . Furthermore, I know that $$(q+1) = \sigma(q) \mid \sigma(q^k) = 2b^2$$ so that $$\frac{q+1}{2} \leq b^2.$$ Finally, I also have $$\frac{q^{k+1} - 1}{2b^2} = q - 1 = \frac{q^k - 1}{a^2}.$$ Alas, here is where I get stuck.

That question asked whether for any choice of $n$ , the sequence generated by this recurrence always contained a power of 2. (The answer is no, see below for examples). It is useful to put this problem in Diophantine equation form. Since $a_k = 3^kn + (3^k - 1)/2$ (easily shown by induction), if $a_x = 2^y$ at some point, we have the Diophantine equation $$2^{y + 1} + 1 = 3^x(2n + 1).$$ I thought an interesting problem would be to classify values of $n$ for which the sequence never reaches a power 2. Did a bit of computer checking up to $n < 10^8$ , and I was surprised to see that for most values of $n$ , they do not reach a power of 2 for $a_k < 1 \text{ googol}$ , and when they do, do so within the first handful of sequence elements. ( Computational results here. ) Low-hanging fruit: Trivial case: If $n = 2^x$ , $a_0$ is a power of 2. For $n > 2$ , if $n \equiv 2,3 \pmod{4}$ , then $a_k \mod 4$ cycles between 2 and 3 (for consecutive terms in the sequence), and thus will never be divisible by 4, and so will never reach a power of 2 greater than 2. So, for $n > 2$ , we only need to consider the case where $n \equiv 0,1 \pmod{4}$ . For $k > 0$ , $a_k \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$ , so $a_k \neq 2^{2m + 1} \equiv -1 \pmod{3}$ for positive $k$ . In other words, if we look past the trivial case, we are actually looking for powers of 4. For $n = (3^z - 1)/2$ where $z > 2$ , the equation above implies $2^{y + 1} + 1 = 3^{x + z}$ , whereupon Mihăilescu's theorem (Catalan conjecture) stipulates $y + 1 = 3$ and $x + z = 2$ . In particular, since $x \geq 0$ , $z \leq 2$ , contra $z > 2$ in our assumption. So for such $n$ , the sequence contains no power of 2.

54,Improved sieve for primes and prime twins?,Improved sieve for primes and prime twins?,,"Suppose we want to estimate the number of primes between $x$ and its square root, say for example between $10$ and $100$ with a sieve. There are $90 $ numbers so we estimate : $\pi(10,100) = 90(1-1/2)(1-1/3)(1-1/5)(1-1/7) \\ = 90 * 2 * 4 * 6 /2 / 3 / 5 / 7 = 90 * 24 / 105 = 20,57\ldots$ This is very good. The true value is $21$ . However we know from The prime number theorem and from Mertens’ theorem that this is only a good estimate up to a multiplicative constant. The problem is easily identified. On one hand we have that divisions have remainders leading to increasing error terms. On the other hand we have this : $(1-1/2)(1-1/3)\cdots(1-1/p_{n-1})(1-1/p_n)$ where $p_n$ is close to The square root of $x$ , leading to meaningless things ( terms ) like $x/(2*3*p_{n-1}*p_n) << 1$ . Truncating is thus the idea. Let $\omega(n)$ count the number of distinct prime factors of the integer $ n \geq 2$ . This $\omega(n)$ is called the prime omega function. Consider the truncated version of $(1-1/2)(1-1/3)\ldots$ : $$ \pi(t,t^2 + t) = \sum_{1<i<t} \frac{(-1)^{\omega(i)} t^2}{i} $$ Where $i$ are the squarefree integers. How much better is this?

Thanks ******** edited feb 22 2020 ************************************ Now turning to this question. I do not know if these formulas are known (probably yes), but since I have not seen them in books or publications, they could be of interest for someone. I found that the equation $a^3 + b^3 = n.c^3$ can be solved in many cases immediately if this much simpler one can also be solved $s^2t + t^2s = st(s+t) = n.k^3$ ....... [A] having the gift that now k = 1 is not a trivial solution, but a very valid one Once resolved (A) we immediately have this form to help $[2(s-t)^3 + 18s^2t]^3 + [-2(s-t)^3 + 18st^2]^3 = st(s+t)[6(s^2+st+t^2)]^3$ ....... [B] When k>1 in [A], $k^3$ goes into the right parenthesis in [B] isolating n In this way, all $n = st(s+t)$ are immediately solved, and most difficult cases remains when it is necessary find value of $k^3$ to reduce n . Example for s=7, t=3 -> $n=3.7(3+7)=210$ $(2(7-3)^3+18.7^2.3)^3 + (-2(7-3)^3+18.7.3^2)^3 = 210.(6(7^2+7.3+3^2))^3$ = $2774^3 + 1006^3 = 210 . 474^3$ dividing all greater common divisor $gcd(2774,1006)^3 = 8$ we have $1387^3 + 503^3 = 210.237^3$ I didn't find a simple way to solve (A) for all n , especially when the value of k is very large, but for small k the work is still easy. For example n = 13 has no immediate solution in [A] but it has for $n = 13.42^3 = 343.8(343+8)$ s=343, t=8, $n = 13.42^3$ , replacing s, t in [B] produces $92132206^3 - 74795614^3 = 13.42^3.722742^3$ dividing by $gcd(921322206,74795614)^3 = 8$ we have $4606103^3 - 3739780^3 = 13.(42.361371)^3$ RECURSION From [B] we have a recursive formula to find infinite solutions. In effect, the above solution was possible because we already knew there was a previous solution $7^3+2^3 = 13.3^3$ So if $Uj^3 + Vj^3 = n.Bj^3$ then s=Uj, t=Vj and we have $n = Uj^3.Vj^3.(Uj^3+Vj^3)$ and substituting in [B] $Uj+1^3 + Vj+1^3 = n.(Uj.Vj.Bj+1)^3$ (please somebody could help me to post j and j+1 values as subscripts?) which is the example mentioned above NOTES: 1) The formula in [B] generally cannot produce the simplest results for n, for example $5^3 + 4^3 = 7.3^3$ , or $7^3 + 2^3 = 13.3^3$ . Maybe these simpler results could be achieved by using complex numbers s=a+bi, t=c+di , but I found a bit difficult to solve this way. 2) In a table for n up to 100 , I was unable to solve [B] ​​for n = 31,67,71,89 which indeed have solutions $31 = (137/42)^3 + (-65/42)^3$ $67 = (5353/1323)^3 + (1208/1323)^3$ $71 = (53/13)^3 + (36/13)^3$ $89 = (197/43)^3 + (-126/43)^3$ Tested values ​​were s, t <= 10,000 Thanks for any comment.","I am trying solve this form, but it appears not easy problem, and also I can't find references about it.
