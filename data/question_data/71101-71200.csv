Like $S^1$, $\mathbb{S}$ is the union of two contractible open sets $\{a,b,c\}$ and $\{a,b,d\}$ whose intersection $\{a,b\}$ is also the union of two disjoint contractible open sets $\{a\}$ and $\{b\}$. I understand why $f$ is continuous and why the quote is true. I have no idea why the quote shows that the fundamental group of the pseudo circle is infinite cyclic, other homotopy groups are zero, and $f$ induces an isomorphism on fundamental groups.

I have several times tried to grasp algebraic topology in the past, and have gone some way each time, however I was always held back by the topology, and have come to StackExchange on a couple occasions to ask questions. I learnt about classifying spaces for vector bundles and principal bundles and thus know of the usefulness of paracompact spaces, so I want to know wether my new paradise (the category of CGWH spaces) contains them. 1) Are paracompact (resp. regular, normal...) spaces compactly generated? 1') Are paracompact (resp. regular, normal...) Hausdorff spaces compactly generated? 2) If not, is the $k$-ification of a paracompact (resp. regular, normal...) space still paracompact (resp. regular, normal...)? 3) Are there free online resources that give a thorough account of paracompactness and other such separation properties (such as regularity, normality, metrizability) and their interplay? The article on nLab linked me to a set of lecture notes I have thus far only saved on my pc (http://www.helsinki.fi/~hjkjunni/ the top.$1$ to top.$10$).",,"['general-topology', 'reference-request', 'compactness', 'paracompactness']"

It is well known that if $p,q \in M$ then there exists a homeomorphism $\phi : M \to M$ such that $\phi(p) = q$.

I have wondered a few times whether: given points $m \in M$ and $p,q \in M \backslash \{m\}$ there exists a homeomorphism $f : M \to M$ which fixes $m$ and sends $p$ to $q$. Now this is true when $M$ is a compact connected topological manifold of dimension $n \geq 2$. Here is why. Since $n \geq 2$, $M \backslash \{m\}$ is a connected manifold whose one point compactification is $M$. By topological homogeneity, there exists a homeomorphism $f : M \backslash \{m\} \to M \backslash \{m\}$ which maps $p$ to $q$. $f$ is a proper map, therefore it lifts to an automorphism $M \to M$ of the 1 point compactification which maps infinity to infinity, i.e it maps $m$ to $m$. It is also true for $\mathbb{R}$. A dilation centered at $m$ does the trick. is the above boxed statement true for other non compact manifolds?","Let $M$ be a connected topological manifold of dimension $n \geq 1$.

51,The uniform metric on $\mathbb{R}^\omega$,The uniform metric on,\mathbb{R}^\omega,"I'm working on a question from Topology by Munkres on p. 127 (Exercise #6).

The question is divided into three parts, of which I have been able to answer the first and last parts of the problem. For the second part, i.e. part (b), I think I'm on the right track but I'm not too sure about that. Part (b) asks to show that $U(\mathbb{x}, \epsilon)$ is not even open in the uniform topology. In my attempt to do this part, I let $\mathbb{x}= \mathbb{0}= (0, 0, 0, 0, ...)$ and $\mathbb{y}= (0, 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, ...)$. Then I computed the distance $\displaystyle\bar{\rho}(\mathbb{x}, \mathbb{y})= \sup_{i \geq 0}(\min\{|x_i - y_i|, 1\})= 1$. So that means the point $\mathbb{y}$ would not be in the open ball of radius $1$, i.e. $B_\bar{\rho}(\mathbb{x}, 1)$. So wouldn't this mean that we can't fit an $\epsilon$-ball around some point $\mathbb{y}$ that stays in $U(\mathbb{x}, \epsilon)$, and hence, $U(\mathbb{x}, \epsilon)$ is not open in the uniform topology induced by $\bar{\rho}$? Any guidance or advice would be greatly appreciated. I'm just starting to learn topology, and still have a lot to learn!

Chapter 1 of this book focuses on the complex number system and chapter 2  focuses on the rudiments of plane topology.  Within chapter 2 are definitions, theorems and (end-of-chapter) exercises that focus on A. disks, open/closed sets, boundary points, sequences, convergence, accumulation points B. continuity, limits C. connected/disconnected sets, domains, components of open sets D. bounded sets and sequences, Cauchy sequences, compact sets, uniform continuity. A set is connected $\;\Leftrightarrow\;$ the set is not disconnected.

I'm working in the setting of compact metric spaces, so most of the basic topological properties will be satisfied. When the space $X$ is also connected, then I know that being locally connected is sufficient to be locally path connected, and is also sufficient for the metric on $X$ to be equivalent to a convex metric.  Thus for compact, connected, metric spaces being locally connected is very strong. But there are also locally connected spaces like dendrites that look very far from manifolds.  There are a lot of characterizations of the arc and the circle, and I know that there are a few characterizations in dimension two, since there are the Moore and Bing characterizations of the 2-sphere.  But I am wondering if there are general local conditions that are strong enough to imply that a point is contained in a neighborhood that looks like some $\mathbb{R}^n$ or $\mathbb{R}^\omega$, the Hilbert Cube? Basically, I am looking for some local condition that a point $x \in X$ can satisfy so that, assuming $X$ is a compact, connected, locally connected metric space, it follows that $X$ is locally Euclidean at $x$ - or has a neighborhood homeomorphic to the closed upper half-plane, i.e. looks like a boundary point of a manifold with boundary.  I am wondering if any of the following three (plus something) are good enough, or if anyone knows some helpful counterexamples: 1) $X$ is locally contractible (not enough by itself, e.g. dendrite or simple triod) 2) $X$ is locally homogeneous (every point has a local basis of homogeneous open neighborhoods) 3) $X$ is strongly locally homogeneous (every $x$ has a local basis $U_i$ of open neighborhoods such that for every $y \in U_i$ there is a homotopy on $U$ sending $x$ to $y$ composed of homeomorphisms) 3a) $X$ is strongly locally homogeneous on every $n$-point set for every $n$ (i.e. the homotopy can be chosen to send any $n$ distinct points to any other $n$ distinct points).

That is, for each $y \in Y$ , there exists a finite subcollection $\mathscr{A}_y$ of $\mathscr{A}$ such that $$ f^{-1} ( \ \{ y \} \ ) \subset \bigcup_{A \in \mathscr{A}_y } A. \tag{0} $$ For each $y \in Y$ , let us put $$ U_y \colon= \bigcup_{A \in \mathscr{A}_y } A, \qquad \mbox{ and } \qquad C_y \colon= X \setminus U_y. \tag{A} $$ Then $U_y$ is an open set in $X$ and $C_y$ is a closed set; moreover we also have $$ f^{-1} ( \ \{ y \} \ ) \subset U_y, \tag{1} $$ and so $$ f^{-1} ( \ \{ y \} \ ) \cap C_y = \emptyset. \tag{2} $$ Now as $f \colon X \to Y$ is a closed map and as $C_y$ is a closed set in $X$ , so the image set $f \left( C_y \right)$ is a closed set in $Y$ . Let us put $$ W_y \colon= Y \setminus f \left( C_y \right). \tag{B} $$ Then $W_y$ is an open set in $Y$ . Now if $x \in f^{-1}\left( W_y \right)$ , then by definition $x \in X$ is such that $f(x) \in W_y$ , which implies that $f(x) \not\in f \left(C_y \right)$ , [Refer to (B) above.] and so $x \not\in C_y$ , which in turn implies that $x \in U_y$ . [Refer to (A) above.] Therefore we have $$ f^{-1} \left( W_y \right) \subset U_y. \tag{3} $$ As $f$ is surjective, so, for each $y \in Y$ , the set $f^{-}( \ \{ y \} \ )$ is non-empty, that is, there exists at least one $x_y \in X$ for which $$ y = f \left( x_y \right). \tag{4} $$ Any such $x_y \in f^{-1}( \ \{ y \} \ )$ of course, and so any such $x_y \not\in C_y$ because of (2) above.

If $X$ is Hausdorff and compact, then it is also locally compact, so the Hausdorff neighborhoods must all be proper subsets of $X$. Does anyone have an idea?",,"['general-topology', 'compactness']"
