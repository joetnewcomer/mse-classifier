I am not sure what the rigorous justification for representing the vector-valued function as $f = (f_1,...,f_n)$ (i.e. why we can write $f$ as $f = (f_1,...,f_n)$ ). How do we know that each component of the vector is a function of $p \in U$ ? I thought of the following: Since $f: U \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ , then we know that $f(p)\in\mathbb{R}^n$ , and thus we can write $f(p)$ as $f = (f_1,...,f_n)$ , where $f_i$ are the components of $f(p)$ . we can say that $f$ is comprised of $n$ different functions because when writing $f_i = \langle f, \mathbf{e}_i \rangle$ , we have $n$ different functions from $U$ to $\mathbb{R}^n$ , so (I hope so) this answers why we can think of $f$ as being made of $n$ functions. but why $f_i$ is function? how do we know that each component of $f$ is a function on its own? I think that we have already established this on the previous point - since $f_i = (f,\mathbf{e}_i)$ , it is a composition of two functions ( $(*,\mathbf{e}_i): U \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ composed over $f$ ), and thus is a function (or alternatively, say that $f_i = \pi_i \circ f$ which is again a function since it is the composition of the projection function over $f$ ). But I feel like I lack the ""intuitive"" understanding of why this is true... the only intuitive (and contorted) explanation I came close to is the following: Since $f$ is a vector-valued function, we know that $f(p) \in \mathbb{R}^n$ , and since it is a vector, we know that the vector and its components are equivalent. Since we know that $p$ determines $f(p)$ and that it is equivalent to its components because it is a vector, we can say that each of its components is also a function of $p$ . I would be grateful if you could make these points clearer (and maybe provide a formal definition, as I think that the cause for my misunderstanding is the lack of a formal definition.
