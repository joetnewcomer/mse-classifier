Please read it after reading the below answer. First, for the ring of functions of G. We may work on each coordinate seperately.

For $i=0$ this gives the polynomial ring generated by X, which is isomorphic to $\mathscr{O}(\mu_p)$ . And our ring $\mathscr{O}(G)$ is the product of those rings. Note in part that this ring is non reduced. Secondly, I had an issue with the fact that $G(k)$ doesn't surject onto $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}(k)$ , as would be expected from an exact sequence of groups. This is infact just a misunderstanding by me of what it means for a sequence of algebraic groups to be exact. For an algebraic group sequence to be exact, the functor of points sequence is only required to be left exact. The condition for right exactness here is instead that the map is faithfully flat (alternatively - flat + surjective as a map of schemes), so that the above construction of $G$ does give us a valid extension.","I am trying to solve exercise 2.6 in Milne's book on Algebraic Groups, which states the following: Let be a a field of characteristic , show that the isomorphism class of extensions , with G a finite commutative alg. group, are classified by extension .

Example: Let $A$ be a ring and consider $A[t]$ , with the grading given by $\deg t = 1$ and $\deg a = 0$ for $a \in A$ . Then the structure map gives an isomorphism $\operatorname{Proj} A[t] \cong \operatorname{Spec} A$ By structure map, the authors mean a morphism of schemes $\varphi : \operatorname{Proj} A[t] \to \operatorname{Spec} A$ . I am not sure exactly what this morphism would be however, I assume that we start off with the standard embedding $A \hookrightarrow A[t]$ and then apply the functor $\operatorname{Spec}$ to get a map $\operatorname{Spec} A[t] \to \operatorname{Spec} A$ and then pre-compose that with the inclusion $i : \operatorname{Proj} A[t] \to \operatorname{Spec} A[t]$ to get the desired morphism $\varphi$ . Now firstly, the $\operatorname{Proj}$ construction only works for graded rings. So $A[t]$ should be of the form $A[t] = \bigoplus_{d \geq 0} A_d$ . The authors say above "" the grading given by $\deg t = 1$ and $\deg a = 0$ for $a \in A$ "" , and I assume that this means that $A_0$ is the image of the standard inclusion of $A$ in $A[t]$ , and that $A_1 = (t)$ , the ideal generated by $t$ so that ""essentially"" $A[t] = A_0 \oplus A_1 = A \oplus (t)$ . Is this the correct interpretation? Now onto the claim that the $\varphi$ yields an isomorphism. I don't even see why $\varphi$ is a bijection, let alone a homeomorphism. If I label the embedding $A \hookrightarrow A[t]$ as $j$ , then $\varphi$ is given by $\varphi(\mathfrak{p}) = j^{-1}(\mathfrak{p})$ for any $\mathfrak{p} \in \operatorname{Proj} A[t]$ and to say that $\varphi$ is bijective would mean that every prime ideal $\mathfrak{q}$ of $A$ is of the form $\mathfrak{q} = j^{-1}(\mathfrak{p})$ for some unique $\mathfrak{p} \in \operatorname{Proj} A[t]$ and for starters I do not see why this would be the case. Furthermore I would need to show that the morphism of sheaves $\varphi^\sharp : \mathcal{O}_{\operatorname{Spec} A} \to \varphi_* \mathcal{O}_{\operatorname{Proj} A[t]}$ is also isomorphic and the way one usually does is by looking at basic open sets on $\operatorname{Spec} A$ . In more words -  if I wanted to see what $\varphi^\sharp$ would be in this case, then if I chose an $f \in A$ and considered the open subset $D(f) \subseteq \operatorname{Spec} A$ then $\Gamma(D(f), \mathcal{O}_{\operatorname{Spec} A}) \cong A_f$ . But $$\Gamma(D(f), \varphi_*\mathcal{O}_{\operatorname{Proj} A[t]}) = \Gamma(\varphi^{-1}(D(f)), \mathcal{O}_{\operatorname{Proj} A[t]})$$ and this may not have such a nice form as far as I know, since $\varphi^{-1}(D(f))$ might not be a basic open subset of $\operatorname{Proj} A[t]$ . So I cannot express $\varphi^\sharp_{D(f)} : \Gamma(D(f), \mathcal{O}_{\operatorname{Spec} A}) \to  \Gamma(\varphi^{-1}(D(f)), \mathcal{O}_{\operatorname{Proj} A[t]})$ in any nice way to allow me to check that $\varphi^\sharp$ would indeed be an isomorphism.","The following is an example I saw in a book on Algebraic Geometry.
