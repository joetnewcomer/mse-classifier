5,Dice game - compute the probability player A wins,Dice game - compute the probability player A wins,,"A few weeks ago, I came across the following problem. Alice and Bob are planning to gamble against each other. Before they start to play the game, Bob wants to calculate its chance of winning to determine if he has a positive expectation. The game works as follows. Charlie starts throwing two dice and he records the sum of the two dice each time. If at a certain point a sequence of two $7$s in a row occurs, Alice wins the game and the game ends. If on the contrary, a sequence of three strictly increasing numbers occurs, Bob wins the game and the game ends. What is the probability that Bob (or Alice) wins the game? I am looking for a theoretical method of solving this problem. I tried a few different ones but it all didn't seem to work. I am thinking that some version of using Markov chains could work, although I don't see how. After doing some simulations I found: The expectation of the number of tries before a sequence of two $7$s is a row occurs, is approximately $42$. The expectation of the number of tries before a sequence of three increasing numbers is a row occurs, is approximately $10.5$. It doesn't seem to work to divide the expectations of the number of tries although you come close, i.e., there is probably some dependence relation going on. The probability of Alice winning is approximately $19\%$.

8,Probabilistic/combinatoric proof of $\sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{tk+r}{k}\binom{t(n-k)+s}{n-k}\frac{r}{tk+r}=\binom{tn+r+s}{n}$,Probabilistic/combinatoric proof of,\sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{tk+r}{k}\binom{t(n-k)+s}{n-k}\frac{r}{tk+r}=\binom{tn+r+s}{n},"In this posting , OP asks a proof of the following identity $$ \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{tk+r}{k}\binom{t(n-k)+s}{n-k} \frac{r}{tk+r} = \binom{tn+r+s}{n} \tag{1} $$ for non-negative integers $t, n, r, s$ with $t, n \geq 1$. I would like to reformulate this question in terms of probability. Here is my try: Setting. Let $(\Omega, 2^{\Omega}, \mathbb{P})$ be the probability space where $\Omega = \{ \omega \subseteq [tn+r+s] : |\omega| = n\}$ is the family of all subsets of $[tn+r+s]$ with size $n$, and $\mathbb{P}$ is the law of uniform distribution on $\Omega$, i.e., $\mathbb{P}(\{\omega\}) = \frac{1}{|\Omega|}$ for each $\omega \in \Omega$. Then define random variables $S_k$ and $T$ on $\Omega$ by $S_k(\omega) = \left|\omega\cap[tk+r]\right|$, for $k = 0, \cdots, n$, $T(\omega) := \min\{ k \geq 0 : S_k(\omega) = k \}$. $\hspace{9em}$ Since $k \mapsto S_k(\omega)$ is a non-decreasing function from $\{0,\cdots,n\}$ to itself, this map has a fixed point and the above definition makes sense. Then I am interested the following claim: Claim. We have $$ \mathbb{P}(T = k) = \frac{r}{tk+r} \frac{\binom{tk+r}{k}\binom{t(n-k)+s}{n-k}}{\binom{tn+r+s}{n}}. \tag{2} $$ Given this claim, the identity $\text{(1)}$ is simply $1 = \mathbb{P}(T < \infty) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \mathbb{P}(T = k) $. I checked this claim for various values of $t, n, r, s$ but was unable to establish a proof. So, here is a question: Although there is a proof using complex analysis in the original posting , I would be happy to know whether a probabilistic or combinatorial proof of $\text{(1)}$ or $\text{(2)}$ is available, not necessarily based on the setting above. It might be helpful to note that $\text{(2)}$ is equivalent to proving the following problem: For each $k$, the number of subsets $A$ of $[tk+r]$ satisfying $|A| = k$ and $|A\cap[tj+r]| > j$ for all $j<k$ is given by $\frac{r}{tk+r}\binom{tk+r}{k}$. This sounds like a generalization of Catalan numbers, although I have no good idea for this.","In this posting , OP asks a proof of the following identity $$ \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{tk+r}{k}\binom{t(n-k)+s}{n-k} \frac{r}{tk+r} = \binom{tn+r+s}{n} \tag{1} $$ for non-negative integers $t, n, r, s$ with $t, n \geq 1$. I would like to reformulate this question in terms of probability. Here is my try: Setting. Let $(\Omega, 2^{\Omega}, \mathbb{P})$ be the probability space where $\Omega = \{ \omega \subseteq [tn+r+s] : |\omega| = n\}$ is the family of all subsets of $[tn+r+s]$ with size $n$, and $\mathbb{P}$ is the law of uniform distribution on $\Omega$, i.e., $\mathbb{P}(\{\omega\}) = \frac{1}{|\Omega|}$ for each $\omega \in \Omega$. Then define random variables $S_k$ and $T$ on $\Omega$ by $S_k(\omega) = \left|\omega\cap[tk+r]\right|$, for $k = 0, \cdots, n$, $T(\omega) := \min\{ k \geq 0 : S_k(\omega) = k \}$. $\hspace{9em}$ Since $k \mapsto S_k(\omega)$ is a non-decreasing function from $\{0,\cdots,n\}$ to itself, this map has a fixed point and the above definition makes sense. Then I am interested the following claim: Claim. We have $$ \mathbb{P}(T = k) = \frac{r}{tk+r} \frac{\binom{tk+r}{k}\binom{t(n-k)+s}{n-k}}{\binom{tn+r+s}{n}}. \tag{2} $$ Given this claim, the identity $\text{(1)}$ is simply $1 = \mathbb{P}(T < \infty) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \mathbb{P}(T = k) $. I checked this claim for various values of $t, n, r, s$ but was unable to establish a proof. So, here is a question: Although there is a proof using complex analysis in the original posting , I would be happy to know whether a probabilistic or combinatorial proof of $\text{(1)}$ or $\text{(2)}$ is available, not necessarily based on the setting above. It might be helpful to note that $\text{(2)}$ is equivalent to proving the following problem: For each $k$, the number of subsets $A$ of $[tk+r]$ satisfying $|A| = k$ and $|A\cap[tj+r]| > j$ for all $j<k$ is given by $\frac{r}{tk+r}\binom{tk+r}{k}$.

Note that this is the same as: probability of exactly one pair + probability of exactly two pairs + probability of exactly 3 of a kind + probability of exaclty 4 of a kind. Let us study a reduced example to help us figure out how to tackle the problem. Imagine that there are 3 balls numbered 1 to 3, coloured red, and 3 similarly numbered balls coloured black. What is the probability of picking 3 balls out of the 6 such that at least two of the balls have the same number value. There are ${6 \choose 3} = 20$ ways of picking out 3 balls from 6:     \begin{align*}     &R1, R2, R3 \quad B1, B2, B3 \\     &\color{blue}{R1, R2, B1} \quad \color{blue}{R1, R2, B2} \quad R1, R2, B3 \\     &\color{blue}{R1, R3, B1} \quad R1, R3, B2 \quad \color{blue}{R1, R3, B3} \\     &R2, R3, B1 \quad \color{blue}{R2, R3, B2} \quad \color{blue}{R2, R3, B3} \\       &\color{blue}{R1, B1, B2} \quad R1, B2, B3 \quad \color{blue}{R1, B1, B3} \\     &\color{blue}{R2, B1, B2} \quad \color{blue}{R2, B2, B3} \quad R2, B1, B3 \\     &R3, B1, B2 \quad \color{blue}{R3, B2, B3} \quad \color{blue}{R3, B1, B3} \end{align*} We see through brute force that the probability of picking 3 balls where at least two balls have the same number value is $12/20 = 3/5$. Let us attempt to arrive at this answer computationally. Now, there are 6 ways from which we can make the initial selection of a ball. There is only one choice for the second ball, since it must have the same number value as the first. There are 4 balls left now, and from it we can choose any one, so there are 4 choices. Thus, in total, there $6 \times 1 \times 4$ ways of making this choice, but $6 \times 4 = 24 > 20$, so $24/20 > 1$. One could imagine that what is going wrong is that we are making subtle assumptions regarding the order in which the balls are picked! So, let's say we divided the numerator out by the number of ways in which we can arrange 3 balls, $3! = 6$; then we get $4/20 = 1/5$, which is still not the right answer. Let us attempt to get rid of order entirely when constructing our solution. There are 3 number values from which we can pick a pair of balls. There are now 4 balls left, and out of them we can pick any ball. So, we have $3 \times 4 = 12$, and indeed $12/20 = 3/5$. Let us apply this method to yet another case: get rid of balls $R3$ and $B3$, so our scenario only has 4 balls. What is the probability of picking two balls with the same value? Well, there are 2 number values from which we can pair of balls, but ${4 \choose 2} = 6$ ways we can pick a pair of balls overall, so the probability of picking two balls with the same value should be $2/6 = 1/3$. Let us verify that this is the case using brute force:     \begin{align*}     &R1, R2 \quad B1, B2 \\     &\color{blue}{R1, B1} \quad R1, B2 \\     &R2, B1 \quad \color{blue}{R2, B2} \end{align*} Okay, so it works here too. Another simple case is 3 colours (say, red, black and white), but only 2 values---what is the probability of picking out a pair of balls with the same number value? In this case, there are 2 choices for the value from which we can pick a pair of balls, but ${6 \choose 2}$ ways of picking out a pair of balls in general. So the answer should be $2/15$? Let us verify using brute force:     \begin{align*}     &R1, R2 \quad B1, B2 \quad W1, W2 \\     &\color{blue}{R1, B1} \quad R1, B2 \\     &\color{blue}{R1, W1} \quad R1, W2 \\     &R2, B1 \quad \color{blue}{R2, B2} \\     &R2, W1 \quad \color{blue}{R2, W2} \\     &\color{blue}{B1, W1} \quad B2, W1 \\     &B2, W1 \quad \color{blue}{B2, W2} \end{align*} The correct answer is actually $6/15 = 2/5$, and it seems the counting method we developed so far does not account for more than 2 colours. There are 3 ways we can pick 2 colours out of 3. There are the 2 number values. So, there are $3 \times 2 = 6$ ways of picking out a pair of balls with the same number value. Hence, the probability of picking out 2 balls with the same number value is $6/15$. Let us apply this method then to the original problem: there are 4 suites from which we can pick 2 out of. There are 13 number values from which we can pick a pair of cards. There are now 50 cards left, so there are ${50 \choose 3}$ ways of picking out out the remaining cards. So the probability should be:     $$\frac{{50 \choose 3} \times {13 \choose 1} \times {4 \choose 2}}{{52 \choose 5}} = 0.59$$ We can no longer brute force to verify, but we can use the work of others to help us. It has been determined that the probability of drawing a hand with no interesting characteristics (i.e. only a high card) is approximately $0.5$. Since probabilities must add up to $1$, there is no way that the probability of drawing at least one pair is greater than approximately $0.5$, so our above answer is incorrect.

But going from $n=1$ to $n=2$ you get a little higher expected payoff (checked the math manually in lieu of a general formula).

31,intuition behind discrepancy in expected number of coin tosses,intuition behind discrepancy in expected number of coin tosses,,"Yesterday evening I read a very interesting article on prime numbers which contained the following paragraph on coin tosses: If Alice tosses a coin until she sees a head followed by a tail, and   Bob tosses a coin until he sees two heads in a row, then on average,   Alice will require four tosses while Bob will require six tosses (try   this at home!), even though head-tail and head-head have an equal   chance of appearing after two coin tosses. I immediately tried to look into this question. Using the formula provided by André Nicolas , it can be shown that the expected number of coin tosses we need before getting $n$ consecutive heads is given by: \begin{equation} e_n = \sum_{k=1}^n\frac{1}{2^k}(e_n+k)+\frac{n}{2^n} \end{equation} For $n=2$, the expected number of heads($e_2$) is 6. Analytically, this makes sense once you become familiar with the above equation. Now, what I find interesting is that, as mentioned in the article, the probability of obtaining two heads is the same as the probability of obtaining a head followed by a tail: \begin{equation} P(HH)=P(HT)=\frac{1}{4} \end{equation} However, the expected number of coin tosses required to get the $HT$ pattern is 4 not 6. I still find this quite counter-intuitive. In fact,  I ran a simulation using the following python code: import numpy as np  head_tail = np.zeros(10000) two_heads = np.zeros(10000)  for i in range(10000):     z = np.random.randint(2, size=100)      for j in range(100):         if z[j] == 1 and z[j+1] == 0:              head_tail[i] = j+2              break      for j in range(100):          if z[j] == 1 and z[j+1] == 1:              two_heads[i] = j+2              break And I noticed that their distributions behaved very differently: It's by no means intuitive to me that the behaviour of these two distributions should be very different and yet they are remarkably different. Is there an intuitive reason why this must be the case?","Yesterday evening I read a very interesting article on prime numbers which contained the following paragraph on coin tosses: If Alice tosses a coin until she sees a head followed by a tail, and   Bob tosses a coin until he sees two heads in a row, then on average,   Alice will require four tosses while Bob will require six tosses (try   this at home!), even though head-tail and head-head have an equal   chance of appearing after two coin tosses. I immediately tried to look into this question. Using the formula provided by André Nicolas , it can be shown that the expected number of coin tosses we need before getting $n$ consecutive heads is given by: \begin{equation} e_n = \sum_{k=1}^n\frac{1}{2^k}(e_n+k)+\frac{n}{2^n} \end{equation} For $n=2$, the expected number of heads($e_2$) is 6. Analytically, this makes sense once you become familiar with the above equation.

To abstract and simplify the situation a little, why don't we just imagine that people everywhere died at random, ignoring the fact that survivors were clumped on ships. I am not interested in the intra-ship relationships anyway. I can calculate that the average person would know about 0.0018 people after the attack. What I don't know how to figure out is how many surviving connections between people there would be in a population of 50,000. And that is the real question. It's not just 0.0018 × 50,000, right? I can't figure out the logic, but I don't expect this to be too hard for some math major to solve. Once you figure out the formula then we could see how likely it would be for you to know people in various social circles, like say 50 for close friends, family, and work colleagues. Bonus question: would the fact that survivors were grouped into ships have a significant effect on the likelihood of inter ship connections?",,"['probability', 'graph-theory']"

Now, Alice has revealed she doesn't have an a anywhere in her password. She has reduced the alphabet size to the attacker by 1. So the total number of passwords for her is: $N_{Alice}=\sum_{n=1}^m (\alpha-1)^n$ Bob's total number of possible passwords has also decreased: $N_{Bob}=\sum_{n=1}^m \alpha^n -\sum_{n=1}^m (\alpha-1)^n$ In other words, $N_B$ has decreased exactly the same amount as the number of possible passwords for Alice, which have the letter a . Now, if $m$ is [the totally unrealistic value of] 1, Alice has clearly given away her password completely, while Bob still has $\alpha - 1$ total passwords. But, as an intuition as $m$ increases towards infinity, I think $N_{Alice} << N_{Bob}$, so I think it is Alice who is now more likely to have his password brute forced!! My calculus is a bit shaky :-) so I do not know yet if it is true that $N_{Alice} << N_{Bob}$ as $m$ tends towards infinity. If this question is reopened, perhaps someone can help me. EDIT4: Trial-and-error in a simple program seems to confirm my intuition. For an alphabet size of 26, if the maximum password length is 17, Bob has given away more.

EDIT3: Here's my stab at the question that I arrived at with my colleagues over lunch yesterday: Let's write the formulae for the number of possible passwords given an alphabet of integer size $\alpha$ and a maximum password length of $m$ $\sum_{n=1}^m \alpha^n$ This I arrived at by summing ""$\alpha$ passwords of length 1"" + ""$\alpha^2$ passwords of length 2"" + ... + ""$\alpha^m$ passwords of length $m$"". Now, Alice has revealed she doesn't have an a anywhere in her password. She has reduced the alphabet size to the attacker by 1. So the total number of passwords for her is: $N_{Alice}=\sum_{n=1}^m (\alpha-1)^n$ Bob's total number of possible passwords has also decreased: $N_{Bob}=\sum_{n=1}^m \alpha^n -\sum_{n=1}^m (\alpha-1)^n$ In other words, $N_B$ has decreased exactly the same amount as the number of possible passwords for Alice, which have the letter a . Now, if $m$ is [the totally unrealistic value of] 1, Alice has clearly given away her password completely, while Bob still has $\alpha - 1$ total passwords. But, as an intuition as $m$ increases towards infinity, I think $N_{Alice} << N_{Bob}$, so I think it is Alice who is now more likely to have his password brute forced!! My calculus is a bit shaky :-) so I do not know yet if it is true that $N_{Alice} << N_{Bob}$ as $m$ tends towards infinity. If this question is reopened, perhaps someone can help me. EDIT4: Trial-and-error in a simple program seems to confirm my intuition. For an alphabet size of 26, if the maximum password length is 17, Bob has given away more. If it is 18, he wins (Alice has given away more).",,"['probability', 'combinatorics', 'cryptography']"
