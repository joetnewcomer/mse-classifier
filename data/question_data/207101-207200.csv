I think the problem is asking to find all the subcartesian products of the two groups $S_4$ and $D_{12}$.

One way to obtain these subgroups is to work with generators of the two groups. We know that $x=(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\alpha_3,\alpha_4), y=(\alpha_1,\alpha_2)$ are two elements that generate $G_1=S^{\Omega_1}$ and $r=(\beta_1,\ldots,\beta_6),s=(\beta_2,\beta_6)(\beta_3,\beta_5)$ generate $G_2=D_{12} \le S^{\Omega_2}$.

Why can't you say that there are 63 pigeonholes and 69 pigeons?","For example, I was reading this example from my textbook: Let S be a set of six positive integers who maximum is at most 14.   Show that the sums of the elements in all the nonempty subsets of S   cannot all be distinct. For each nonempty subset A of S the sum of the elements in A denoted   $$S_A$$ satisfies $$1\leq S_A \leq 9+10+...+14=69$$ and there are $$2^6-1=63$$   nonempty subsets of S. We should like to draw the conclusion from the   pigeonhole principle by letting the possible sums, from 1 to 69 be the   pigeonholes with 63 nonempty subsets of S as the pigeons but then we   have too few pigeons.

(a) Let $C$ be an odd cycle in graph $G$ . Prove that $\chi(G - V(C)) \leq 2$ . (b) Prove that $\chi(G) \leq 5$ . Attempt: (a) To prove that $\chi(G - V(C)) \leq 2$ , we need to show that the chromatic number of the graph resulting from removing the vertices of any odd cycle $C$ from $G$ is at most 2. Given $C$ , let $G' = G - V(C)$ be the graph obtained by removing the vertices of $C$ from $G$ . We aim to show that $\chi(G') \leq 2$ . Since $C$ is an odd cycle, $G'$ remains connected because the removal of $V(C)$ cannot disconnect $G$ due to the given property that any pair of odd cycles in $G$ share at least one vertex. Now, I consider a maximal path $P$ in $G'$ . Since $P$ is a path, its endpoints are of degree 1 in $G'$ . Now I suppose $P$ has length $k$ . Since $P$ is maximal, the neighbors of the endpoints of $P$ must all lie on $P$ . Because $P$ is a path, each of its vertices has at most two neighbors on $P$ . Have I started o. k.? Is this the right path? (b) To prove that $\chi(G) \leq 5$ , where $\chi(G)$ denotes the chromatic number of the graph $G$ , I use a proof by contradiction. I assume, for the sake of contradiction, that $\chi(G) > 5$ . This implies that there exists a coloring of $G$ using at least $6$ colors. Let $c: V(G) \rightarrow {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}$ be such a coloring. Now I consider the induced subgraph $G_i$ of $G$ consisting of all vertices colored with color $i$ , for $i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$ . Since $\chi(G) > 5$ , at least one of these induced subgraphs, say $G_6$ , must be non-empty. Since $G_6$ is non-empty, it must contain at least one vertex, say $v$ .

Looking at statement 3, the only way 2 people replied yes is if there are no knaves, 2 knaves, or 4 knaves. Statment 2 implies that there must be, at fewest, 4 knaves (as if the knights had both 4 and 8). Therefore, there are 4 knaves total. Statement 2 shows us that, because there are 4 knaves, they must not have 4 and 8 and we know two knaves have 5 and 10 from statement 3. This means that, for statement 1 to be true, the other two knaves must have even numbers, 2 and 6 in this case. Therefore, we know that there are 4 knaves with 2, 5, 6, and 10 and 6 knights with 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9.",,"['elementary-number-theory', 'discrete-mathematics', 'logic', 'recreational-mathematics']"
