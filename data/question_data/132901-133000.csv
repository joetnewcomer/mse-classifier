20,Is a general state space a manifold?,Is a general state space a manifold?,,"I asked a similar question on the physics SE at this link but did not really get an answer so I'll ask here. My question there is a bit more detailed. From what I have recently learned, in classical mechanics, the configuration of some mechanical systems (say, a double pendulum) can be described by a point on an n -dimensional smooth configuration manifold, $Q$ . The dynamics are then often studied using Lagrangian mechanics on $TQ$ , or using Hamiltonian mechanics on $T^*Q$ , both of which have coordinate representations in $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ . Long before I ever heard the word manifold, I was ""doing"" dynamics using some 2n ""state space"" variables in $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ . I know now that when using state space variables of the form $(\pmb{x},\dot{\pmb{x}})$ , I'm really working with some coordinate representation of $(\text{x},\mathbf{v})\in TQ$ . I could transform to some other coordinates $(\pmb{q},\dot{\pmb{q}})$ but, contrary to what I used to think,  this is not actually a different state space but rather just different coordinates for the same $(\text{x},\mathbf{v})\in TQ$ (right?). Similarly, when using state space variables of the form $(\pmb{x},\pmb{p}_{x})$ (phase space coordinates), I'm really working with some coordinate representation of $(\text{x},\mathbf{p})\in T^*Q$ . I could transform to some other $(\pmb{q},\pmb{p}_{q})$ but again this is not a different phase space but just different coordinates for the same $(\text{x},\mathbf{p})\in T^*Q$ (right?). My Question: When working directly with coordinates in $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ , we also commonly use more general ""state space"" coordinates which are not necessarily of the lagrangian form, $(\pmb{x},\dot{\pmb{x}})$ , nor of the canonical/symplectic form $(\pmb{x},\pmb{p})$ , but are rather just some 2n variables that fully define the state (for example, the classic Keplerian orbit element for the two-body problem). Are such coordinates on $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ actually a coordinate representation for some ``state space manifold '' ?  Or put differently, it seems $TQ$ and $T^*Q$ are two particular types of a ""state space manifold"" for which the coordinates and equations of motion have certain properties, but is there a more general manifold on which we can study the dynamics? note: I'm aware that in the Hamiltonian formulation we can use some canonical transformation such that the coordinates $(\pmb{x},\pmb{p})$ are not necessarily split into ""position level"" coordinates and ""velocity-level"" coordinates.

73,Initial value problem for second order linear differential equation : why am I only getting zero as a solution?,Initial value problem for second order linear differential equation : why am I only getting zero as a solution?,,"I am given the following ODE : $y'' - 2ay'+by = 0$ for some real constants $a,b$, along with the initial conditions $y(0) = y(1) = 0$. Furthermore I know that some function $y$ is a solution of this ODE. How do I show that $y(n) = 0$ for all natural numbers $n$? The idea would be to solve the equation : it is a second order linear differential equation. Hence, (skipping rigour) we solve $r^2 - 2ar + b = 0$ to get solutions $r_1,r_2$ which may or may not be equal (and may be complex). The solution is now given by : 1 : $y(t) = c_1 e^{r_1 t} + c_2 e^{r_2 t}$ if $r_1 \neq r_2$ (note that if they are complex then by Euler's formula we have a linear combination of trigonometric functions coming in) 2 : $y(t) = c_1 e^{r_1t} + c_2te^{r_1}t$ if $r_1 = r_2$. In case 1 , substituting $y(0) = 0$ gives $c_1 + c_2 = 0$ and combining with $y(1)=0$ gives $e^{r_1} = e^{r_2}$ and $c_1 = -c_2$, so $\color{red}{e^{r_1 t} = e^{r_2 t} \mbox{ for all } t}$ hence the solution is identically zero. In case 2, substituting $y(0) = 0$ gives $c_1 = 0$  and then $y(1) = 0$ gives $c_2 = 0$ so the solution is identically zero. There is definitely something wrong here. I'd like people to point it out, since I think I've blindly used the formula given to me here. This function is supposed to be non-zero at least at the integers, and the fact that no more is provided hints that there are non-trivial solutions.

The other equations similar to this are: $(1+ x + y)dy - (1- 3x - 3y)dx = 0$ Answer: $3x + y + 2ln(-x - y +1) = k$ $(3x - y + 2)dx + (9x - 3y +1)dy = 0$ Answer: $2x + 6y + C = ln(6x - 2y +1)$ If someone point me out how to solve the first equation I will be likely to solve the others. Thank you very much. Update: Given Orangutango and Chris help I moved to a solvable d.e. But didn't get the same answer my professor listed. Did I miss some step? (X + 2Y)dX = (2X+Y)dY dY/dX = (X + 2Y)/(2X + Y) Making a substitution to solve the now homogenous: Y = VX, Y'= V + V'X V+V'X = (X + 2VX)/(2X + VX) V+V'X = (1 + 2V)/(2 + V) V'X = ((1 + 2V)/(2 + V)) - V V'X = (1 - V^2)/(2 + V) (2 + V)dV/(1-V^2) = dX/X Integrating the left side I got: int (2 + V)dV/1-V^2 = 2 * int dV / (1-V^2) + int V dV / (1-V^2) = log | (v + 1) / (v-1) | - 1/2 log | V^2 + 1 | + c1 Integrating the right side: log X + c2 Then replacing V=Y/X and then X=x-2 and Y=y-1 don't seems to yield the proposed answers. Where did my professor got this? Is the above solution correct? Thanks again.",,['ordinary-differential-equations']
