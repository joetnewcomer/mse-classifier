0,How many Euler diagrams with $n$ sets exist?,How many Euler diagrams with  sets exist?,n,"Does anyone have any thoughts on this? I have been struggling with it and I'm not sure if it's a hard problem, or easy and I'm just not getting it? For $n=2$ sets (say $A$ and $B$), it's obviously 4: The one where $A \cap B = \emptyset$ The one in which $A \cap B \neq \emptyset$, but neither set is a subset of the other The one where $A \subset B$ The one where $B \subset A$ (I'm assuming $A \neq B$ in all cases.) For $n \ge2 $, though it seems rather difficult. I can't think of a systematic way to count them. Originally I thought I could look at all distinct pairs and allow each pair to take on one of three values (representing disjoint, intersecting, and subset). But I've already found a case where two different diagrams can have the same representation this way. Any ideas? Thanks.","Does anyone have any thoughts on this?

Let's say you work in the field of computer vision, or else. How can you claim your method is optimal if you don't prove it down to the lowest levels of mathematics? Here are two cases when it helps to get things down to low levels and when it is not so useful: 1) A relation R is defined as set of ordered pairs (x,y), such that the relation x R y holds. You can think of a relation in two ways: the intuitive, where you think ok I have two objects x and y and there is relation between them, or you can think of it the set theory way where a relation is a set of pairs. In this case reducing the relation down to set theory, does add new knowledge or view on what a relation is and can be helpful. The idea of an empty relations is very useful, meaning that that relation does not hold for no two objects. In summary, it is useful to think about a relation both the intuitive and the set theory way. 2) On the other hand for some things it is not useful to get them down to the fundamental levels. For example, an ordered pair. Intuitively you know what it is. Then the question is, can I learn more about it from its set theory definition? My opinion is no, because a pair (x,y) is expressed as {{x}, {x,y}} and that definition in terms of sets does not really add any new understanding to the idea of an ordered pair.

I also want to confirm whether my arguments are valid for each case. Here goes: Base case: Consider when $n = 1$, i.e., the set $A = \{a\}$ where $a \in \mathbb{R}$. Then for $\epsilon \in \mathbb{R}^+ \cup \{0\}$, $a+\epsilon$ is an upper bound for $A$ and $a-\epsilon$ is a lower bound for $A$, hence $A$ is bounded. Inductive hypothesis: Assume that any set of $k$ reals is bounded. Proof: By the inductive hypothesis, let $B = \{a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_k\}$ where $a_i \in \mathbb{R}$ for $i = 1, 2, \cdots, k$. Then there exists some $u \in \mathbb{R}$  such that $a \le u$ for all $a \in B$ and similarly, there exists some $l \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $l \le a$ for all $a \in B$. Now assume we add one more element, $a_{k+1}$, to $B$ and form the set $C = B \cup \{a_{k+1}\}$, now consider the following three cases: 1) If $\min(B) \le a_{k+1} \le \max(b)$ then $C$ is still bounded above by $u$ and below by $l$, hence $C$ is bounded. 2) If $a_{k+1} > \max(B)$, then $a_{k+1} \le u + |a_{k+1} - \max(B)|$, then $u + |a_{k+1} - \max(B)|$ is an upper bound for $C$, while $l$ is still a lower bound for $C$, hence $C$ is bounded. 3) If $a_{k+1} < \min(B)$, then $l - |\min(B) - a_{k+1}| \le a_{k+1}$, then $|\min(B) - a_{k+1}|$ is a lower bound for $C$ while $u$ is still an upper bound for $C$, hence $C$ is bounded. Thus, we have shown that any set of $k+1$ reals is bounded, hence we are done. Are my arguments valid? Are there any quicker ways of proving this inductively?

I am having some difficulty coming up with the appropriate notation to succinctly articulate how the set of overlapping intervals between two devices represents the periods during which they encountered.

I believe this essentially makes this a ""set of sets"", if we treat an interval in time (e.g. [513, 936]) as a set.  Let's call this set of sets $I_d$. To find overlaps in $d$ and another device $e$'s sessions, we can take the ""cross intersection""(?)

I'm a student of Mathematical Physics and unfortunately my college doesn't offer a set theory course, so that we are not taught to prove bijections between arbitrary sets. The single variable calculus course we have teaches us to prove bijections by looking for one inverse function in a very clear way: we write $y = f(x)$, try to solve for $x$ and then create the function desired (it's of course more formal than that, first we prove injectivity showing that $f(x)=f(y)$ implies $x=y$ and then we look for the inverse to prove surjectivity). The multivariable calculus course on the other hand doesn't talk about proving bijections from subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$ to subsets of $\mathbb{R}^m$. On the other hand we have the analysis course, the topology course and the differential geometry course that all presumes we know how to prove those bijections and so on. Now, I'm confused, because none of our courses teaches to prove that kind of thing. If we have some function $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$, proving injectivity is the easiest part, but for surjectivity, seeking for some inverse seems kind of painful. By now I'm studying differential geometry of curves and surfaces (it uses Do Carmo's book), and the only thing I'm needing is this basic notion on how to prove bijections in these cases (for instance, when we come to show that something is a chart, proving continuity is rather easy, we have been taught on how to do it, but proving the bijection is complicated). Is there any general guidelines as there is in the case of functions from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$? Is there any reference that can be given that treats this in a good way? Again, I know this is basic and that we all should know before coming to things like differential geometry, but since the course doesn't teach this, I came to ask here to fill this gap. Thanks very much in advance, and sorry if this question is silly.","I have a question that may seem trivial or silly, however I'll try to make my point clear. I'm a student of Mathematical Physics and unfortunately my college doesn't offer a set theory course, so that we are not taught to prove bijections between arbitrary sets. The single variable calculus course we have teaches us to prove bijections by looking for one inverse function in a very clear way: we write $y = f(x)$, try to solve for $x$ and then create the function desired (it's of course more formal than that, first we prove injectivity showing that $f(x)=f(y)$ implies $x=y$ and then we look for the inverse to prove surjectivity). The multivariable calculus course on the other hand doesn't talk about proving bijections from subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$ to subsets of $\mathbb{R}^m$. On the other hand we have the analysis course, the topology course and the differential geometry course that all presumes we know how to prove those bijections and so on. Now, I'm confused, because none of our courses teaches to prove that kind of thing. If we have some function $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$, proving injectivity is the easiest part, but for surjectivity, seeking for some inverse seems kind of painful. By now I'm studying differential geometry of curves and surfaces (it uses Do Carmo's book), and the only thing I'm needing is this basic notion on how to prove bijections in these cases (for instance, when we come to show that something is a chart, proving continuity is rather easy, we have been taught on how to do it, but proving the bijection is complicated). Is there any general guidelines as there is in the case of functions from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$? Is there any reference that can be given that treats this in a good way? Again, I know this is basic and that we all should know before coming to things like differential geometry, but since the course doesn't teach this, I came to ask here to fill this gap. Thanks very much in advance, and sorry if this question is silly.",,"['real-analysis', 'reference-request', 'elementary-set-theory']"
