0,How to find solutions to equation $f'(x)+f(x)-Kf(-x)=0$,How to find solutions to equation,f'(x)+f(x)-Kf(-x)=0,"I want to find solutions to the ordinary differential equation $$f'(x)+f(x)-Kf(-x)=0$$ when $K$ is a nonzero real constant.

I am able to find power series solutions simply by taking $$f(x)=\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty}a_nx^n$$ but I would really like to have something more insightful here, such as a closed-form solution in terms of whatever functions they may be, or even just some properties that we can say about solutions to this differential equation. Alternatively, if anyone can give me suggestions on how to proceed with finding out these things for myself, I would welcome any help. The main issue comes from that $f(-x)$ term anyway.

If f and g are linearly dependent on some interval $I$ , then, WLOG we may assume $f = cg$ for some scalar $c$ , so that the Wronskian becomes $W(f(t),g(t))$ = $\begin{vmatrix} cg(t) & g(t)\\ cg'(t) & g'(t)\\ \end{vmatrix}$ = $c.g(t)g'(t)-c.g'(t)g(t)=0$ on $I$ .
