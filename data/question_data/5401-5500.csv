Does the conclusion follow if $f(x)$ is of bounded variation, but not absolutely continuous? This question represents the last of my ""not entirely confident"" answers I gave on my recent qualifying exam. Generally, I'm concerned about whether I've applied all the concepts correctly in my proof. ATTEMPT: Given that $f(x)$ is absolutely continuous, we have that $f'(x)$ exists a.e. and that $\int_x^y f'(t)dt=f(y)-f(x)$ for all $y, x\in[0,1]$, $y>x$. Suppose that $L=\sup\left|f'(x)\right|<\infty$ where the supremum is taken over all $x\in[0,1]$ such that $f'(x)$ exists. Without loss of generality, let $y,x\in [0,1]$ with $y>x.$ Then we have that $\int_x^y f'(t)dt = f(y)-f(x) \leq \int_x^y L dt = L(y-x)$. Hence $f(x)$ is Lipschitz. Suppose $f(x)$ is Lipschitz; hence there is an $L<\infty$ such that $\left|f(y)-f(x)\right|\leq L\left|y-x\right|$ for $y,x \in [0,1]$.

This concludes the proof. For the follow-up question, the conclusion does not follow, as a function that is not absolutely continuous cannot be Lipschitz (I provided a proof that all Lipschitz functions are absolutely continuous, but will not reproduce it here). To show that this set is nonempty, let $f$ be the Cantor function on $[0,1]$. Then $f$ is a bounded, monotone increasing function, hence of bounded variation (with total variation 1) with $f'(x)=0$ a.e.

Long version: First, consider $$a_n = \sum_{k=0}^n \frac{(-1)^k}{k!}$$ It is well-known that $a_n \to \dfrac1e$ as $n \to \infty$; indeed $a_n = \dfrac{!n}{n!}$ is the truncation to the first $n$ terms of the power series for $e^x$, evaluated at $x = -1$ (where $!n$ denotes the subfactorial; it is also equal to the number of derangements on $n$ elements). There is also a simple expression for the generating function $A(z) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n z^n$, which is $A(z) = \dfrac{e^{-z}}{1-z}$. (See Exponential Generating Functions For Derangements .) Next, consider $$b_n = \sum_{k=0}^n \frac{n^{\underline k}}{n^k} \frac{(-1)^k}{k!}$$ where $n^{\underline k} = \binom{n}{k}k!$ denotes a falling factorial, so the extra factor $\frac{n^{\underline k}}{n^k}$ is $\frac{n(n-1)\cdots(n-k+1)}{n(n)\cdots(n)} = 1\cdot\left(1 - \frac1n\right)\cdot\left(1 - \frac2n\right)\cdots\left(1 - \frac{k-1}n\right)$ which for large $n$ (and fixed $k$) is close to $1$.  I don't know if $b_n$ has a simple form for its generating function too, but it is easy to see that $b_n \to \dfrac1e$ as well; indeed by the binomial theorem we have $b_n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} (\frac{-1}{n})^k = \left(1 - \frac1n \right)^n$ which is well-known to converge to $\frac1e$ (indeed such a limit is sometimes taken to be the definition of $e^x$). Finally, consider $$c_n = \sum_{k=0}^n \frac{n^{\underline k}}{n^k} \frac{n^{\underline k}}{n^k} \frac{(-1)^k}{k!}$$ This is the same transformation going from $b_n$ to $c_n$ as from $a_n$ to $b_n$.

Though we don't go into this detail, what is meant by the limit along a path is to pick a parameterisation $\gamma : (r, s) \to \mathbb{R}^2$ with $\displaystyle\lim_{t \to s^-}\gamma(t) = {\bf a}$, and then check that $\displaystyle\lim_{t \to s^-}f(\gamma(t)) = L$.

When asked to determine whether or not the limit $\displaystyle\lim_{{\bf x} \to {\bf 0}}f({\bf x})$ exists, there are only a couple of things the students can do: employ continuity if possible (limit laws may be needed), use polar coordinates together with the squeeze theorem, find a path along which the limit does not exist, and find two paths with have different limits.

For reference this is a problem in Hardy and William's The Green Book of Mathematical Problems . I believe I have a proof of this and would appreciate if anyone could check for its correctness.

From squaring the defining relation, we get $$x_{n}^2=x_{n-1}^2+2k+\frac{k^2}{x_{n-1}^2} > x_{n-1}^2 +2k$$ Applying this same estimate $n$ times gives us the lower bound $ x_{n}^2 > a^2+2nk$ , so that $x_{n} > \sqrt{2nk+a^2}>\sqrt{2k(n+1)}$ (*) We then get $$\liminf_{n \to \infty}\frac{x_{n}}{\sqrt{n}} \geq \liminf_{n \to \infty}\sqrt{2k\frac{n+1}{n}}=\sqrt{2k}$$ We'll now show $$\limsup_{n \to \infty}\frac{x_{n}}{\sqrt{n}}\leq\sqrt{2k}$$ We first derive an upper bound on $ x_{n}-x_{n-1} $ .

Cooke proves this by saying that: Since $x\geq0$ for all $x \in K$ and for any positive number $\epsilon$ there is only a finite set of number s in $K$ larger than $1+\epsilon$ , it is clear that no negative number and no number larger than 1 can be a limit point of K. Hence we need only consider positive numbers $x$ satisfying $0\lt x \lt 1 $ . If $x$ is such a number and $x$ is not one of the points $\frac1m$ , let $p$ be such that $\frac1{1+p} \lt x \lt \frac1\epsilon$ , and let $\epsilon=\frac12\min(x-\frac1{p+1},\frac1p - x)$ . The intersection of the set $K$ with the interval $(x-\epsilon,x+\epsilon)$ is contained in the set of points $$ \left\{\frac1{p+1}+\frac1k:p+1\le k \lt \frac1\epsilon\right\} \cup \left\{\frac1m+\frac1n:m\le n \lt \frac1{p+1} - \frac1{p+2}; m=p+2, \ldots,2p+2\right\}, $$ which is a finite set. Therefore $x$ cannot be a limit point of $K$ .

Is it a typo? $$ \left\{\frac1m+\frac1n:m\le n \lt \frac1{p+1} - \frac1{p+2}; m=p+2, \ldots,2p+2\right\}, $$ here I think n is meant to be an integer in order for the finite argument to work, but how can be $$ n \lt \frac1{p+1} - \frac1{p+2}\:\:? $$ Here is how I fixed the typo to work: if $$ \left\{\frac1m+\frac1n:m\le n \lt \frac1{p+1} - \frac1{p+2}; m=p+2, \ldots,2p+2\right\} $$ is changed to $$ \left\{\frac1m+\frac1n: m\le n, \frac1n \ge \frac1{p+1} - \frac1{p+2}; m=p+2, \ldots,2p+2, n \in N\right\}, $$ then $m\le n \le (p+1)(p+2)$ which would be finite.

I'm not sure how much context I should include to make this question understood, so I'll just include it all; my question will be at the very bottom of the post if the details aren't needed and you want to skip to it. I found the following problem, and thought of two ways to solve it: $\textbf{Problem}$: A real-valued function $f$ on a closed, bounded interval $[a,b]$ is said to be upper semicontinuous provided that for every $\epsilon>0$ and every $p\in[a,b]$, there is a $\delta=\delta(\epsilon,p)>0$ such if $x\in[a,b]$ and $|x-p|<\delta$ then $f(x)<f(p)+\epsilon$. Prove that an upper semicontinuous function is bounded above on $[a,b]$. $\underline{\text{First Proof}}$: The argument is by contradiction. Suppose that $f$ is not bounded above. Then, for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$, there exists $x_n$ such that $f(x_n)>n$. Since the sequence $(x_n)$ is bounded, it contains a convergent subsequence, $(x_{n_k})$, converging to some $x^*\in[a,b]$. Given $\epsilon>0$, there exists $\delta>0$ such that for all $x$ satisfying $|x-x^*|<\delta$, we have $f(x)<f(x^*)+\epsilon$. There exists $K$ such that for all $k\geq K$ we have $|x_{n_k}-x^*|<\delta$, so that $f(x_{n_k})<f(x^*)+\epsilon$ for all $k\geq K$. This is a contradiction, since we must have $f(x_{n_k})>n_k\geq k$ for all $k$. $\underline{\text{Second Proof}}$: Given an $\epsilon >0$, the set of open intervals $$\mathcal{O}=\big\{(p-\delta_{\epsilon,p}, p+\delta_{\epsilon,p}): p\in [a,b]\big\}$$ forms an open cover of $[a,b]$. Heine-Borel guarantees the existence of a finite subcover: $$[a,b] \subset \bigcup^{n}_{i=1}(p_i-\delta_{\epsilon,p_i}, p_i+\delta_{\epsilon, p_i}).$$ Let $f(p^*)=\max \{f(p_1),f(p_2),...,f(p_n)\}$. Then $f(x)<f(p^*)+\epsilon$ for all $x\in [a,b]$, so that $f(p^*)+\epsilon$ serves as an upper bound for $f$ on $[a,b]$. After doing the second proof and rereading the first proof, I realized (assuming the proofs are correct): Both rely on the compactness of the interval $[a,b]$. The first proof uses the sequential characterization of compactness; the second uses the finite subcover definition of compactness. I wondered: Can I use the sequential characterization to get a direct proof? I don't see how to do this, and doubt it can be done. So, here's my question: If a direct proof really $\textit{isn't}$ possible with the sequential characterization, is there some deeper reason for this? Does this suggest some underlying difference between the sequential characterization and the finite open subcover definition? More generally, it's impossible not to notice that there are often several equivalent characterizations of a single concept in analysis (e.g., the $\epsilon$-$\delta$ vs. the sequential vs. the open set definitions of continuity), and sometimes one is more appropriate than another. If it happens that for a given problem or a given theorem, one characterization of a concept only allows for indirect proof whereas another characterization allows for a direct proof, is there always some reason for this? Does this tell us anything significant about the differences between the characterizations, or about what assumptions underlie the different characterizations? I hope this question make sense.

I found the following problem, and thought of two ways to solve it: $\textbf{Problem}$: A real-valued function $f$ on a closed, bounded interval $[a,b]$ is said to be upper semicontinuous provided that for every $\epsilon>0$ and every $p\in[a,b]$, there is a $\delta=\delta(\epsilon,p)>0$ such if $x\in[a,b]$ and $|x-p|<\delta$ then $f(x)<f(p)+\epsilon$. Prove that an upper semicontinuous function is bounded above on $[a,b]$. $\underline{\text{First Proof}}$: The argument is by contradiction. Suppose that $f$ is not bounded above. Then, for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$, there exists $x_n$ such that $f(x_n)>n$. Since the sequence $(x_n)$ is bounded, it contains a convergent subsequence, $(x_{n_k})$, converging to some $x^*\in[a,b]$. Given $\epsilon>0$, there exists $\delta>0$ such that for all $x$ satisfying $|x-x^*|<\delta$, we have $f(x)<f(x^*)+\epsilon$. There exists $K$ such that for all $k\geq K$ we have $|x_{n_k}-x^*|<\delta$, so that $f(x_{n_k})<f(x^*)+\epsilon$ for all $k\geq K$. This is a contradiction, since we must have $f(x_{n_k})>n_k\geq k$ for all $k$. $\underline{\text{Second Proof}}$: Given an $\epsilon >0$, the set of open intervals $$\mathcal{O}=\big\{(p-\delta_{\epsilon,p}, p+\delta_{\epsilon,p}): p\in [a,b]\big\}$$ forms an open cover of $[a,b]$. Heine-Borel guarantees the existence of a finite subcover: $$[a,b] \subset \bigcup^{n}_{i=1}(p_i-\delta_{\epsilon,p_i}, p_i+\delta_{\epsilon, p_i}).$$ Let $f(p^*)=\max \{f(p_1),f(p_2),...,f(p_n)\}$. Then $f(x)<f(p^*)+\epsilon$ for all $x\in [a,b]$, so that $f(p^*)+\epsilon$ serves as an upper bound for $f$ on $[a,b]$. After doing the second proof and rereading the first proof, I realized (assuming the proofs are correct): Both rely on the compactness of the interval $[a,b]$. The first proof uses the sequential characterization of compactness; the second uses the finite subcover definition of compactness. I wondered: Can I use the sequential characterization to get a direct proof? I don't see how to do this, and doubt it can be done. So, here's my question: If a direct proof really $\textit{isn't}$ possible with the sequential characterization, is there some deeper reason for this? Does this suggest some underlying difference between the sequential characterization and the finite open subcover definition? More generally, it's impossible not to notice that there are often several equivalent characterizations of a single concept in analysis (e.g., the $\epsilon$-$\delta$ vs. the sequential vs. the open set definitions of continuity), and sometimes one is more appropriate than another. If it happens that for a given problem or a given theorem, one characterization of a concept only allows for indirect proof whereas another characterization allows for a direct proof, is there always some reason for this? Does this tell us anything significant about the differences between the characterizations, or about what assumptions underlie the different characterizations? I hope this question make sense.

75,Could Euclid have proven Dedekind's definition of real number multiplication?,Could Euclid have proven Dedekind's definition of real number multiplication?,,"In Euclid's day, the modern notion of real number did not exist; Euclid did not believe that the length of a line segment was a quantity measurable by number. But he did think it made sense to talk about the ratio of two lengths. In fact, he devotes Book V of his Elements to the study of such ratios, using the so-called Eudoxian theory of proportions. Here's how it works. Let $w$ and $x$ be two magnitudes of the same kind (for instance two lengths), and let $y$ and $z$ be two magnitudes of the same kind (for instance two areas). Then [according to Euclid,][2] the ratio of $w$ to $x$ is said to be equal to the ratio of $y$ to $z$ if for all positive integers $m$ and $n$, if $nw$ is greater, equal, or less than $mx$, then $ny$ is greater, equal, or less than $mz$, respectively.  Or to put it in modern language, $w/x = y/z$ if the same rational numbers $m/n$ are less than both, the same rational numbers are equal to both, and the same rational numbers are greater than both. In other words, a ratio is defined by the classes of rational numbers which are less than, equal to, and greater than it. If you've studied real analysis; this should look familiar to you: it is how the real number system is constructed using Dedekind cuts! In fact, Dedekind took the Eudoxian theory of proportions in Euclid's Book V as the inspiration for his Dedekind cut construction. So to sum up, while Euclid wouldn't have thought of them as numbers, his notion of ""ratios"" basically corresponds to our notion of ""positive real numbers"". Now with that background, my question is about the multiplication of real numbers.  Here is how Euclid defines the product of ratios: we say that the product of $w/x$ and $y/z$ is equal to $u/v$ if there exist magnitudes $r,s,$ and $t$ such that $w/x = r/s$, $y/z = s/t$, and $u/v = r/t$.  (This is well-defined by Euclid's proposition V.22 )  But this is not the standard way that multiplication is defined in the Dedekund cut construction of the real numbers, where you form a new cut by taking the products of the rational numbers in the two cuts that you're multiplying. So my question is, how can we prove than Euclid's definition of real number multiplication is equal to the Dedekind cut definition?  If I'm not mistaken, the problem basically reduces to proving the following: For all positive integers $l$, $m$, and $n$ and all magnitudes $x$, $y$, and $z$: If $l/m < x/y$ and $m/n < y/z$ then $l / n < x/ z$ If $l/m = x/y$ and $m/n = y/z$ then $l / n = x/ z$ If $l/m > x/y$ and $m/n > y/z$ then $l / n > x/ z$ And that in turn is equivalent to the following: For all positive integers $l$, $m$, and $n$ and all magnitudes $x$, $y$, and $z$: If $ly < mx$ and $mz < ny$ then $lz < nx$ If $ly = mx$ and $mz = ny$ then $lz = nx$ If $ly > mx$ and $mz > ny$ then $lz > nx$ So does anyone have any idea how to go about proving that?  For reference, addition of magnitudes is associative and commutative, and magnitudes also obey the following properties : V.1. Multiplication by numbers distributes over addition of magnitudes.   $m(x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n) = m x_1 + m x_2 + ... + m x_n$ V.2.

That is, I need to prove that the following inequality holds for any $\mathbf{w}_1,\mathbf{w}_2\in\mathbb{R}^n$, $\boldsymbol{\Omega}_1,\boldsymbol{\Omega}_2\in\mathbb{S}^{n\times n}_+$, and $\alpha\in[0,1]$: $$\alpha\mathbf{w}_1^T\boldsymbol{\Omega}_1^{-1}\mathbf{w}_1+\beta\mathbf{w}_2^T\boldsymbol{\Omega}_2^{-1}\mathbf{w}_2-(\alpha\mathbf{w}_1+\beta\mathbf{w}_2)^T(\alpha\boldsymbol{\Omega}_1+\beta\boldsymbol{\Omega}_2)^{-1}(\alpha\mathbf{w}_1+\beta\mathbf{w}_2)\ge 0,$$ where $\beta=1-\alpha$.

For example: If $f(x)=\sin(x)$ defined on the interval $[-\pi,\pi]$, then $N(f,0)=2$, since $f(x)$ is negative on $(\pi,0)$ and positive on $(0,\pi)$. If $f(x)=x\cdot \sin(1/x)$ on the same interval then then $N(f,0)=\infty$, since this function crosses the line y=0 infinitely many times . What term describes the functions for which $N(f,C)$ is finite for every $C$ and on any interval?",,"['real-analysis', 'terminology']"
93,Marginal of Dirichlet distribution is Beta (integral),Marginal of Dirichlet distribution is Beta (integral),,"Just for the sake of simplicity, take $K=3$ then a random vector $(X_1,X_2,X_3)$ has a Dirichlet distribution, i.e. $(X_1,X_2,X_3)\sim Dirichlet(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\alpha_3)$ if the density takes the form: $$p(x_1, x_2) \propto x_1^{\alpha_1-1} x_2^{\alpha_2-1} (1-x_1-x_2)^{\alpha_3-1}.$$ The support is the $2$-dimensional simplex: $0<x_1,x_2,x_3<1$, $x_1+x_2+x_3=1$. The dependence is just on two variables because of the restriction $x_1+x_2+x_3=1$. So one can ask about the distribution of $X_1$ and $X_2$.

I am currently reading Courant & John's Introduction to Calculus and Analysis Volume I . Unfortunately, I have stumbled upon an ambiguous notation on page 41. It begins: Our definition of continuity of the function $f(x)$ at $x_0$ requires that for every degree of precision $\epsilon > 0$ there exists quantities $\delta \gt 0$ (so-called moduli of continuity) such that $|f(x)-f(x_0)| < \epsilon$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$ for which $|x-x_0| < \delta$ . He then goes on to say that (for ""regular continuity""): In general, as our example show, this $\delta = \delta(\epsilon)$ depends not only on $\epsilon$ but also on the value of $x_0$ . What exactly is meant by a modulus of continuity and how is it related to $\delta(\epsilon)$ ? Edit - Upon further inspection I have noted that the ""modulus of continuity"" depends on both $x_0$ and $\epsilon$ for ""regular continuity"", however only depends on $\epsilon$ for uniform continuity.
