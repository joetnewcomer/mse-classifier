0,$\mathbb{Z} _{29}$ is a field. True or False.,is a field. True or False.,\mathbb{Z} _{29},"My answer was True and this is my argument: Since $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ has got $2$ operations plus the other properties of a ring, I figured that it is indeed a ring. On the other hand, since $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ is abelian (commutative) and has the multiplicative identity $1$, It can be concluded that it is a $Commutative$ Ring with an $identity$, hence implies that it is a Field. I've also read a theorem which states that: ""Every finite integral domain is a field."" Is my argument acceptable and can I also use the above theorem as an argument? Your help would be really appreciated.","My answer was True and this is my argument: Since $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ has got $2$ operations plus the other properties of a ring, I figured that it is indeed a ring.

Let $F$ be an algebraically closed field. $I\in F[X_1,...,X_n]$ an ideal. Denote by $S(I)$ the subset in $F^n$ consisting of all $n$-tuples $(a_1,...,a_n)\in F^n$ such that $f(a_1,...,a_n)=0$ for all $f\in I$. A subset $S\subset F^n$ is called closed if there exists an ideal $I$ (of $F[X_1,...,X_n]$ such that $S=S(I)$. Prove that the union of any two closed sets is closed. Here is my attempt: First: I claim that if $S$ is closed then I can find an $I$ such that it is generated by one element and $S(I)=S$. Proof: By definition of closed we know there is a $J$ such that $S=S(J)$. Since our ring is Noetherian we know that $J$ is f.g. so $J=\langle f_1,..,f_k\rangle$. Let $h=\gcd(f_i)$. I claim that $I=\langle h\rangle $ works. If $(a_1,..,a_n)\in S$, then $f_i(a_1,..,a_n)=0$. Since $h=\sum \alpha_i f_i$ (Bezout), we just plug in $(a_1,...,a_n)$ at both sides and obtain that $h(a_1,...,a_n)=0$, so indeed $(a_1,...,a_n)\in S(I)$. For the reverse inclusion if $(a_1,..,a_n)\in S(I)$, then $h(a_1,...,a_n)=0$. As $h\mid f_i$, we have that $f_i(a_1,...,a_n)=0$, so $(a_1,...,a_n)\in S(J)$. Now using this fact, I will solve the question: Let $S_1$ and $S_2$ be closed with $I_1=\langle f\rangle$ and $I_2=\langle g\rangle$  such that $S_1=S(I_1)$, and $S_2=S(I_2)$. Then let $h=$lcm$ (f,g)$. Then we have that $S(\langle h\rangle)$ works. If $(a_1,...,a_n)\in S_1\cup S_2$, then either $f(a_1,...,a_n)$ or $g(a_1,...a_n)=0$ (wlog say the first case happens). Then since $f\mid h$ then $(a_1,...,a_n)\in S(\langle h\rangle)$. For the other inclusion just note that if $h(a_1,...,a_n)=0$ then eithe $f(a_1,...,a_n)=0$ or $g(a_1,...,a_n)=0$ (because otherwise we would have $fg(a_1,....,a_n)\neq 0$ and since $h\mid fg$ we would get a contradiction here) so we have that either $(a_1,...,a_n)\in S_1$ or $(a_1,...,a_n)\in S_2$.

Since $h=\sum \alpha_i f_i$ (Bezout), we just plug in $(a_1,...,a_n)$ at both sides and obtain that $h(a_1,...,a_n)=0$, so indeed $(a_1,...,a_n)\in S(I)$. For the reverse inclusion if $(a_1,..,a_n)\in S(I)$, then $h(a_1,...,a_n)=0$. As $h\mid f_i$, we have that $f_i(a_1,...,a_n)=0$, so $(a_1,...,a_n)\in S(J)$. Now using this fact, I will solve the question: Let $S_1$ and $S_2$ be closed with $I_1=\langle f\rangle$ and $I_2=\langle g\rangle$  such that $S_1=S(I_1)$, and $S_2=S(I_2)$. Then let $h=$lcm$ (f,g)$. Then we have that $S(\langle h\rangle)$ works. If $(a_1,...,a_n)\in S_1\cup S_2$, then either $f(a_1,...,a_n)$ or $g(a_1,...a_n)=0$ (wlog say the first case happens). Then since $f\mid h$ then $(a_1,...,a_n)\in S(\langle h\rangle)$. For the other inclusion just note that if $h(a_1,...,a_n)=0$ then eithe $f(a_1,...,a_n)=0$ or $g(a_1,...,a_n)=0$ (because otherwise we would have $fg(a_1,....,a_n)\neq 0$ and since $h\mid fg$ we would get a contradiction here) so we have that either $(a_1,...,a_n)\in S_1$ or $(a_1,...,a_n)\in S_2$.

Assume the result is true for $S_{n - 1}$ . Consider $\sigma \in S_n$ and assume that $\sigma(n) = k \neq n$ , otherwise we could think of $\sigma$ as a product of transpositions in $S_{n - 1}$ and tack on $\tau (n) = n$ for all the transpositions. Take transposition $\tau \in S_n$ that interchanges $k$ and $n$ . Then $\tau \sigma$ leaves $n$ fixed and can therefore be written as $\tau \sigma = \tau_m \tau_{m - 1} \dots \tau_1$ where all the transpositions on the right-hand side are extensions of transpositions in $S_{n - 1}$ that leave $n$ fixed. Multiply by $\tau$ on the left to see that $\sigma = \tau \tau_m \tau_{m - 1} \dots \tau_1$ as desired. To prove that $\#(S_n) = n!$ we again use induction on $n$ . The base case is clear.

93,How can one go about counting the amount of abelian groups of a fixed order?,How can one go about counting the amount of abelian groups of a fixed order?,,"Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $$ n = p_1^{a_1} \cdots p_r^{a_r}  $$ be its factorization into primes. My intention is to count how many abelian groups $G$ of order $n$ are there. What follows are my thoughts about this question, which surely are quite rudimentary. By the structure theorem, we have that: $$ G \simeq \bigoplus_{i = 1}^r \bigoplus_{j = 1}^{m_i} \mathbb{Z}/(p_i^{s_{i,j}})  $$ with $s_{i,1} \leq \dots \leq s_{i,m_i}$ for each $i$ and thus, the cardinals of these two groups must coincide: $$ n = \prod_{i = 1}^r \prod_{j = 1}^{m_i} p_i^{s_{i,j}} = \prod_{i = 1}^r p_i^{\sum_{j = 1}^{m_i}s_{i,j}} $$ Therefore, by the uniqueness of prime factorization, $$ s_{i,1} + \dots + s_{i,m_i} = a_i \quad (\forall i\in [r])  $$ The question then turns into a combinatorial one, that is, how many combinations of non-negative, non-decreasing integers are there such that: $$ s_{i,1} + \dots + s_{i,m_i} = a_i \quad (\forall i\in [r])  $$ Since the problem is independent for each prime, we can tackle each of these independently. Moreover, we can count the amount of tuples of non negative numbers $(s_1, \dots, s_{a_i})$ in increasing order such that $\sum_{j = 1}^{a_i}s_j = a_i$; that is, we can fix a size for the amount of numbers, since the smallest possible case is to have exactly $a_i$ ones. Having done this, we have as many combinations as the $a_i$-th coefficient of the following generating function $$ f_i = \prod_{j = 1}^{a_i}(1-X^j)^{-1} = \left(\sum_{k \geq 0}X^k\right) \dots \left(\sum_{k \geq 0}X^{ka_i}\right) $$ by corresponding solutions to $x_1 + 2x_2 + \dots + a_ix_{a_i} = a_i$ with tuples by taking: $$ s_{a_i-q} = \sum_{k = q}^{a_i}x_k $$ that is, we would have $[f_i]_{a_i}$ possible solutions, giving a total of $$ [f_1]_{a_1} \cdots [f_r]_{a_r} $$ possible abelian groups of order $n$. I'd really appreciate if you could comment on whether this approach is correct or not and if so, how could one get a more explicit answer, since this one is rather unsatisfactory.","Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $$ n = p_1^{a_1} \cdots p_r^{a_r}  $$ be its factorization into primes.

98,Smallest variety containing $\mathbb{Z}$,Smallest variety containing,\mathbb{Z},"I've been told that the answer is all abelian groups, but I don't see how. I know that the class of all nilpotent groups of degree 1 is a group variety and that a group being nilpotent of degree 1 is equivalent to that group being abelian so the class of all abeliani groups is indeed a variety.  I also know that the integers are a group when considered with addition as the operation and that a class of algebraic structures of the same signature is a variety if and only if it is closed under the taking of homomorphic images, subalgebras and (direct) products, but I'm not quite sure how to use this here or if this is even the way to go about this.
