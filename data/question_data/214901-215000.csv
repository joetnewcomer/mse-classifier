0,Question inside $\int \tan^2 x dx$,Question inside,\int \tan^2 x dx,"$$\int \tan^2 x dx$$ the question isn't behind on how to do it but rather on its solution , let me go through my solution quickly: If we do a substitution $u=\tan(x)$ then $du=\sec^2 x dx=(u^2+1)dx$ hence we get $$\int \frac{u^2}{1+u^2}du=\int\left(1-\frac{1}{1+u^2}\right)du=\tan x-\arctan(\tan x)+C$$ so no problem until here. The solution from the book or WolframAlpha is: $\tan x-x+C$ so it raised a question, since $\tan $ isn't injective and only has an inverse for $x\in(-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2})$ , for which then $\arctan(\tan(x))=x$ is only true for $x\in(-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2})$ . But then why if we do $\arctan(\tan x)=x$ in my solution we then get $$\tan x-x+C$$ which is the same as the correct solution the book or WolframAlpha shows, while we have only just considered the $x\in(-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2})$ in my method? Isn't the indefinite integral considering $\forall x\in \mathbb{R}$ ? Why is this happening?

There is an answer here that differs from mine (they claim for $-\infty<\alpha<-2$ and $1<\alpha<\infty$, but I'm not trusting it...they make an error in the third indented line of the solution...they claim that $$\int_0^\infty C u^\beta du$$ is finite for some $\beta$, which is false. Maybe it's just a slip of the pen, and they have the right answer, but here is my analysis: My answer: I claim it is convergent iff $\alpha < -1$. ( Update: iff $|\alpha|>1$.) Case 1 : $\alpha>0$: As $x\to 0$, sine goes to zero, and we have that $\sin(x^\alpha)= x^\alpha + O(x^{3\alpha})$. Therefore we are fine at zero iff $\alpha<1$. Now to examine behavior at infinity, make the substitution $u=x^\alpha$, and $$\int_0^\infty \sin(x^\alpha)dx=\frac{1}{\alpha}\int_0^\infty\sin(u)u^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}du.$$ As $x\to \infty$, also $u \to\infty$, so we consider the behavior at infinity of the above integral. By the Dirichlet test, it will converge iff $\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}<0$, which, along with $\alpha>0$, gives the condition $\alpha>1$. So it works for no $\alpha>0$, and since $\alpha =0$ is a non-starter, we are reduced to the case $\alpha<0$. Case 2 : $\alpha<0$: As $x\to \infty$, $x^{\alpha}\to 0$, so as $x\to\infty$, $\sin(x^\alpha)=x^{\alpha}+O(x^{3\alpha})$. So we have convergence as $x\to \infty$ iff $\alpha <-1$. Now to examine behavior at zero, again integrate by parts and get $$\int_0^\infty \sin(x^\alpha)dx=\frac{1}{\alpha}\int_0^\infty\sin(u)u^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}du,$$ only this time as $x\to 0$, $u\to \infty$. So we find that it is finite as $x\to\infty$ iff $\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}$, which is always true when $\alpha<0$. Therefore it is finite iff $-\infty < \alpha < -1$. Does this work? Can you see any errors in my analysis. I was confident before I read the other answer.
