1,The intersection of a connected subspace with the boundary of another subset,The intersection of a connected subspace with the boundary of another subset,,"Can someone please verify my proof or offer suggestions for improvement? Definition/Notation: The boundary of $A$, denoted by $\operatorname{Bd}(A)$, equals $\overline{A} \cap \overline{X-A}$. Let $A \subseteq X$. Show that if $C$ is a connected subspace of $X$ that intersects both $A$ and $X-A$, then $C$ intersects $\operatorname{Bd}(A)$. Suppose $C$ does not intersect $\operatorname{Bd}(A)$. Then, for each $x \in C$, it must be the case that either $x \notin \overline{A}$ or $x \notin \overline{X-A}$.

In this case, pick an open set $V_x$ in $X$ such that $x \in V_x \subseteq A$ and set $U_x = \varnothing$. Now, note that the sets $C \cap \bigcup_{x \in C} U_x$ and $C \cap \bigcup_{x \in C} V_x$ are open in $C$ under the subspace topology and are also nonempty (since there exists an $x \in C$ belonging to $\overline{A}$ and a $y \in C$ belonging to $\overline{X-A}$, otherwise one of $C \cap \overline{A}$ and $C \cap \overline{X-A}$ is nonempty, which implies that one of $C \cap A$ and $C \cap (X-A)$ is empty, a contradiction.)

Firstly we will prove that $E$ is bounded: $X$ is compact, and therefore it is bounded. That is, there exist $x_0 \in X,r_1>0$ such that $d(x,x_0)<r_1$ for all $x \in X$. $Y$ is also compact, and similarly there exist $y_0 \in Y,r_2>0$ such that $d(y,y_0)<r_2$ for all $y \in Y$.

We will prove that its limit $a:=\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n$ is in $E$. $(x_n)$ is a sequence in the compact set $X$, therefore it admits a convergent subsequence $(x_{n_k}) \to \bar{x}$. $(y_{n_k})$ is a sequence in the compact set $Y$, and therefore it admits a convergent subsequence $(y_{n_{k_l}}) \to \bar{y}$. The sequence $(x_{n_{k_l}},y_{n_{k_l}})_l$ converges to $(\bar{x},\bar{y})$ in the product space, and the continuity of the metric gives $a=\lim_{l \to \infty} a_{n_{k_l}}=\lim_{l \to \infty} d(x_{n_{k_l}},y_{n_{k_l}})=d(\bar{x},\bar{y})$.

Now, for any $d(x,y) \in E$, we have $$d(x,y) \leq d(x,x_0)+d(x_0,y_0)+d(y,y_0)<r_1+d(x_0,y_0)+r_2 =:M.$$ This proves that $E$ is bounded. And now we will prove that $E$ is also closed: Let $a_n=d(x_n,y_n)$ be sequence in $E$, which is convergent in $\mathbb R$. We will prove that its limit $a:=\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n$ is in $E$. $(x_n)$ is a sequence in the compact set $X$, therefore it admits a convergent subsequence $(x_{n_k}) \to \bar{x}$. $(y_{n_k})$ is a sequence in the compact set $Y$, and therefore it admits a convergent subsequence $(y_{n_{k_l}}) \to \bar{y}$. The sequence $(x_{n_{k_l}},y_{n_{k_l}})_l$ converges to $(\bar{x},\bar{y})$ in the product space, and the continuity of the metric gives $a=\lim_{l \to \infty} a_{n_{k_l}}=\lim_{l \to \infty} d(x_{n_{k_l}},y_{n_{k_l}})=d(\bar{x},\bar{y})$. This shows that $a \in E$ as required. In summary I have shown that $E$ is compact, and from a well-known theorem it has a minimum. Is this proof OK? I think that the completeness of $S$ is unnecessary. Thank you.",,"['general-topology', 'metric-spaces', 'compactness']"

15,Properties of the Category of topological spaces with $n$ basepoints.,Properties of the Category of topological spaces with  basepoints.,n,"I've recently encounted a problem in my reading which would seem to be more naturally phrased if the category we work in shifted from the category $\textbf{Top}^*$ of pointed topological spaces, to the category $\textbf{Top}^{*n}$ of topological spaces with an ordered set of $n$ distinct basepoints and continuous maps between them which preserve the ordered basepoint set. Let $X$ be a topological space and let $A=\{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}\subseteq X$ be it's baspoint set for some finite natural number $n$. I'm particularly interested in the homotopy of these spaces and so I feel it is probably natural to consider the relative fundamental groupoid $\pi_1(X,A)$ of these spaces. I don't know too much about the fundamental groupoid of a space though other than basic definitions. I wonder if someone could outline what properties we gain and lose by considering the category $\textbf{Top}^{*n}$ instead of the category $\textbf{Top}^*$. For instance, this category still has an initial object which is just the finite set of $n$ elements with the discrete topology however, I don't believe $\textbf{Top}^{*n}$ has terminal objects. This category still has a coproduct given by identifying the basepoint sets of two objects element-wise with respect to their order (a kind of wedge product at $n$ points) but it's not clear that we still have products. How might these properties change if we loosen our category to include maps which possibly permute the ordering of the basepoint set? Also how does the fundamental groupoid functor $\pi_1(.,A)$, which takes an object in $\textbf{Top}^{*n}$ to its fundamental groupoid $\textbf{Top}^{*n}$ relative to its basepoint set $A$, differ from the usual fundamental group functor. If there is a functor which takes an object in $\textbf{Top}^{*n}$ to $\textbf{Top}^*$, does this induce a functor $\textbf{Grpd}_n\rightarrow \textbf{Grp}$ from the category of groupoids with $n$ objects to the category of groups (possibly via classifying spaces?)? Hopefully the questions I've asked are closely related to each other enough that I don't need to break this in to multiple questions.

Clearly I should just verify that $\mathcal T\ $ satisfies the topology axioms. I can see why both $\mathbb R$ and $\emptyset$ are ""closed"" sets in $\mathcal T\ $. I can also show that if $C_1 = A_1 \cup T_1$ and $C_2 = A_2 \cup T_2$ are two ""closed"" sets, then their union is also ""closed"". Hence, by induction, a finite union of ""closed"" sets is also ""closed"". The part that I am stuck in is showing that an arbitrary intersection of ""closed"" sets is also closed. Let $I$ be an arbitrary index set. For $i \in I$, let $C_i = A_i \cup T_i$ be such that $A_i$ is closed in $\mathbb R$ and $T_i \subseteq S$. I want to write the intersection $$ C := \bigcap_{i \in I} (A_i \cup T_i) $$ in a form which makes it evident that $C$ is ""closed"". But naively distributing the $\bigcap$ over the $\cup$ does not seem to work. Please suggest some hints! Though this is not really homework, I'll add the homework tag since I am not looking for complete solutions anyway.",,['general-topology']

Then f is injective, as $\left[x\right]\neq\left[y\right]$ means $x\neq y$ hence if $\left[x\right],\left[y\right]\neq\left[1\right]$ , $$f\left(\left[x\right]\right)=x\neq y=f\left(\left[y\right]\right)$$ and if without loss of generality $\left[x\right]=\left[1\right]$ , then $\left[y\right]\neq\left[1\right]$ and $$f\left(\left[y\right]\right)=y\neq1\neq f\left(\left[x\right]\right).$$ It is surjective as for any $x\in\left[0,1\right], f\left(\left[x\right]\right)=x$ .

Similarly if $U\subset\left[0,2\right]\big/\left[1,2\right]$ is open, if $\left[1\right]\notin U$ then $$f\left(U\right)=q^{-1}\left(U\right)=\left\{ x:\left[x\right]\in U\right\}$$ thus from the continuity of $q$ , $f\left(U\right)$ is open, and if $\left[1\right]\in U$ , $$f\left(U\right)=q^{-1}\left(U\setminus\left[1\right]\right)\cup\left\{ 1\right\}$$ where $q^{-1}\left(U\setminus\left[1\right]\right)$ is open, as given any point $x$ it satisfies $x<1$ , and given an open neighborhood $U_{x}$ of $\left[x\right]$ in U, if it contains $\left[1\right]$ , then $$q^{-1}\left(U_{x}\setminus\left[1\right]\right)=q^{-1}\left(U_{x}\right)\setminus\left[1,2\right]$$ which is open, showing $U\setminus\left[1\right]$ also contains such a neighborhood.

71,Topology of CW-complex and attaching map,Topology of CW-complex and attaching map,,"I think I must have a fundamental misconception in place right now in my mind. When defining a CW-complex, we use inductively continuous maps from $f_{\partial \sigma} :S^n \to K^{(n)}$. We then define a natural map $f_{\sigma}: D^{n+1} \to K^{(n+1)}$ which proceeds with the construction. For this, we take the disjoint union $\bigsqcup\limits_{\sigma} D_{\sigma}^{n}$ over the cells we are attaching and define $$K^{(n+1)} =  \left(\bigsqcup\limits_{\sigma} D_{\sigma}^{n} \right) \cup_f K^{(n)}  .$$ Now, why do we need $f_{\partial \sigma}$ to be continuous?  The definition of the topology on $K^{(n+1)}$ does not require continuity of $f_{\partial \sigma}$. We have a disjoint union, and a quotient map, which defines the quotient topology. Also, the $f_{\sigma}$ seem to be continuous, even if $f_{\partial \sigma}$ is not. This would follow from the fact that $f_{\sigma}$ is equal to $\pi \circ i$, where $\pi$ is the quotient map and $i$ is the inclusion map on the disjoint union, and those maps are continuous. $f_{\sigma}$ being continuous implies $f_{\sigma}|_{S^{n}}$ being continuous, since it is just the restriction. But such restriction is commonly considered as the attaching map $f_{\partial \sigma}$ itself, which (by what I said above) need not be continuous for such definitions to make sense. The problem at hand, it seems, is that the induced topology on $K^{(n)}$ as a subspace is not the same as the topology of $K^{(n)}$ itself, and maybe this is why we require the attaching maps to be continuous (in order for restriction to preserve the expected topologies), but I'm not sure. My question, summing up the issues, is: What is the relevance of the attaching map being continuous? If it is not, what kind of issues arise?","I think I must have a fundamental misconception in place right now in my mind. When defining a CW-complex, we use inductively continuous maps from $f_{\partial \sigma} :S^n \to K^{(n)}$. We then define a natural map $f_{\sigma}: D^{n+1} \to K^{(n+1)}$ which proceeds with the construction. For this, we take the disjoint union $\bigsqcup\limits_{\sigma} D_{\sigma}^{n}$ over the cells we are attaching and define $$K^{(n+1)} =  \left(\bigsqcup\limits_{\sigma} D_{\sigma}^{n} \right) \cup_f K^{(n)}  .$$ Now, why do we need $f_{\partial \sigma}$ to be continuous?  The definition of the topology on $K^{(n+1)}$ does not require continuity of $f_{\partial \sigma}$. We have a disjoint union, and a quotient map, which defines the quotient topology. Also, the $f_{\sigma}$ seem to be continuous, even if $f_{\partial \sigma}$ is not. This would follow from the fact that $f_{\sigma}$ is equal to $\pi \circ i$, where $\pi$ is the quotient map and $i$ is the inclusion map on the disjoint union, and those maps are continuous. $f_{\sigma}$ being continuous implies $f_{\sigma}|_{S^{n}}$ being continuous, since it is just the restriction. But such restriction is commonly considered as the attaching map $f_{\partial \sigma}$ itself, which (by what I said above) need not be continuous for such definitions to make sense. The problem at hand, it seems, is that the induced topology on $K^{(n)}$ as a subspace is not the same as the topology of $K^{(n)}$ itself, and maybe this is why we require the attaching maps to be continuous (in order for restriction to preserve the expected topologies), but I'm not sure.

94,"The topology a line inherits as a subspace of $\mathbb{R}_l \times \mathbb{R}$, or of $\mathbb{R}_l \times \mathbb{R}_l$ (Munkres)","The topology a line inherits as a subspace of , or of  (Munkres)",\mathbb{R}_l \times \mathbb{R} \mathbb{R}_l \times \mathbb{R}_l,"Exercise 8, Chapter 2, Section 16, Page 92, from the Munkres's book: The topology $\mathbb{R}_l$ is the topology on $\mathbb{R}$ generated by all half-open intervals of the form \begin{align*} [a, b) = \{ x \, |\, a \le x < b \}, \end{align*} where $a < b$ . By Lemma 13.4 from the Munkres's textbook, this topology is finer than the standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$ . Thus, all open sets of the standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$ also belong to the topology of $\mathbb{R}_l$ . By Theorem 15.1 from the Munkres's textbook, a basis for the product topology $\mathbb{R}_l \times \mathbb{R}$ is the collection of all the products $[a, b) \times (c, d)$ , where $[a, b)$ is a half-open interval in $\mathbb{R}$ , and $(c, d)$ is an open interval in $\mathbb{R}$ . The products $[a, b) \times (c, d)$ represent the interior of rectangles, where the rectangles have sides parallel to the coordinate axes, along with the left side of the rectangle. The corners do not belong to the open set. To avoid difficulty with notation, we shall denote the general element of $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ by $x \times y$ . Let $L$ be a straight line in the plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ ; then, $L$ is a subset of points of $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ . The topology $L$ inherits as a subspace of $\mathbb{R}_l \times \mathbb{R}$ , has as basis all sets of the form $[a, b) \times (c, d) \cap L$ ; it is easy to see that the intersection is a line segment of $L$ . We have three possible cases: (1) The straight line $L$ is parallel to $x$ -axis. Therefore, $L$ intersects the left side of the rectangles, and then the points of the line segment belong to a half-open interval of $L$ , which can be denoted as $[\alpha, \beta)$ , where $\alpha,\beta \in L$ . We deduce that the topology $L$ inherits as subspace of $\mathbb{R}_l \times \mathbb{R}$ is the topology of $\mathbb{R}_l$ . (2) The straight line $L$ is parallel to $y$ -axis. Therefore, $L$ intersects the upper and lower sides of the rectangles, and then the points of the line segment belong to an open interval of $L$ , which can be denoted as $(\alpha, \beta)$ , where $\alpha,\beta \in L$ . Therefore, the topology $L$ inherits as subspace of $\mathbb{R}_l \times \mathbb{R}$ is the standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$ . (3) The straight line $L$ is not parallel to any of the axes. Therefore, if $L$ intersects the left side of the rectangles, the points of the line segment belong to a half-open interval of $L$ , which can be denoted as $[\alpha, \beta)$ , where $\alpha,\beta \in L$ . But if $L$ does not intersect the left side of the rectangles, the points of the line segment belong to an open interval of $L$ , which can be denoted as $(\alpha, \beta)$ , where $\alpha,\beta \in L$ . The collection of half-open intervals $[\alpha, \beta)$ is a basis for the topology of $\mathbb{R}_l$ , and the open intervals $(\alpha, \beta)$ are open sets in $\mathbb{R}_l$ . It follows that the topology $L$ inherits as subspace of $\mathbb{R}_l \times \mathbb{R}$ is the topology of $\mathbb{R}_l$ . Now, let us consider the topology $L$ inherits as a subspace of $\mathbb{R}_l \times \mathbb{R}_l$ . By Theorem 15.1 from the Munkres's textbook, a basis for the product topology $\mathbb{R}_l \times \mathbb{R}_l$ is the collection of all the products $[a, b) \times [c, d)$ , where $[a, b)$ is a half-open interval in $\mathbb{R}$ , and $[c, d)$ is a half-open interval in $\mathbb{R}$ . The products $[a, b) \times [c, d)$ represent the interior of rectangles, where the rectangles have sides parallel to the coordinate axes, along with their left and lower sides. Note that the lower left corner of the rectangle belongs to the product $[a, b) \times [c, d)$ as well. Let $L$ be a straight line in the plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ . The topology $L$ inherits as a subspace of $\mathbb{R}_l \times \mathbb{R}_l$ , has as basis all sets of the form $[a, b) \times [c, d) \cap L$ . We have also three possible cases: (1) The straight line $L$ is parallel to $x$ -axis, or is parallel to $y$ -axis. In the first case, $L$ intersects the left side of the rectangles, and in the second case, $L$ intersects the lower side of the rectangles. In both cases, the points of the line segment belong to a half-open interval of $L$ , which can be denoted as $[\alpha, \beta)$ , where $\alpha,\beta \in L$ . We deduce that the topology $L$ inherits as subspace of $\mathbb{R}_l \times \mathbb{R}_l$ is the topology of $\mathbb{R}_l$ . (2) The straight line $L$ is not parallel to any of the axes, and makes an angle less than $\pi / 2$ with the $x$ -axis. Therefore, $L$ intersects the left side, the lower side, or the lower left corner of the rectangles, and then, the points of the line segment belong to a half-open interval of $L$ , which can be denoted as $[\alpha, \beta)$ , where $\alpha,\beta \in L$ . Again, the topology $L$ inherits as subspace of $\mathbb{R}_l \times \mathbb{R}_l$ is the topology of $\mathbb{R}_l$ . (3) The straight line $L$ is not parallel to any of the axes, and makes an angle greater than $\pi / 2$ with the $x$ -axis. Therefore, $L$ may intersect any sides of the rectangles, or may only intersect the lower left corner of the rectangle. Then, if the intersection is a line segment of the straight line $L$ , the points belong to an interval open, half-open or closed of $L$ ; if the intersection is a point of $L$ , we have a one-point open set (singleton set). Then, the topology $L$ inherits as subspace of $\mathbb{R}_l \times \mathbb{R}_l$ is the discret topology on $\mathbb{R}$ .","Exercise 8, Chapter 2, Section 16, Page 92, from the Munkres's book: The topology is the topology on generated by all half-open intervals of the form where .
