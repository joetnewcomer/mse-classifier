I can't see how the proof of this should work, though.

Gerrymandering is the process of drawing boundaries of constituencies in such a manipulative way such that a certain political party or group is favoured disproportionately to their size. Often a district can very obviously be seen to be gerrymandered if it appears to be an “ugly”, “rough”, “unnatural” shape - for example, very uneven borders and panhandles that stick out of it. The 12 Most Gerrymandered Districts In America - Ranker gives the following example of Maryland’s 3rd district: In reality, things may be more complicated and a “nice” looking shaped district may actually be heavily gerrymandered if it happens to over/underrepresent a certain demographic. For our purposes we will ignore such complexity and focus solely on the shape of a district. Formally, let $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ be a closed set of finite area. I’m wondering if we can come up with some index $$g: \{ \text{such subsets $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$} \} \to [0,1]$$ such that a “nicely shaped” $E$ , such as a near-circle/square/etc. has $g(E) \approx 0$ , and a “roughly shaped” $E$ , such as the shape of Maryland’s district 3 above, has $g(E) \approx 1$ . Some properties $g$ should have are that it should be invariant under scaling/reflection/rotation/translation of the shape $E$ , as such transformations make the shape no better or worse. An example of an attempt An attempt at a solution to this problem is to let $g(E)$ be one minus the probability that, picking two points $x_1, x_2 \in E$ uniformly at random, that the line connecting $x_1$ and $x_2$ lies entirely within $E$ . One positive of this index is that all convex $E$ have $g(E) = 0$ , i.e. not at all gerrymandered - a value we may want since convex sets have smooth boundaries, and are path-connected. $g$ is also invariant under rotations/translations/etc. A disadvantage of this index is a district may be considered heavily gerrymandered if there is a large hole, or several large holes within it, perhaps representing large lakes/seas in a real world setting. Also, “smooth” districts that are very much non-convex, such as a banana-shaped district, may be considered heavily gerrymandered.

17,Are convex objects determined by their silhouettes?,Are convex objects determined by their silhouettes?,,"Informally, the silhouette of a 3D shape is a viewpoint-dependent 2D projection of it. You might imagine looking at several silhouettes and attempting to construct the overall shape.  My question is theoretical: if you have access to the set of all silhouettes of a convex figure —unordered, that is to say, you know only the silhouettes, not the viewing angles associated with each one—is that always sufficient to uniquely reconstruct the shape? Or are there convex shapes that are not related via any rigid transformation that have indistinguishable silhouette profiles? I have been working on this problem, and I'm stumped.  So far, I've tried generating asymmetric (chiral) shapes, and attempting to answer the question in two dimensions instead of three. Here's one attempt to formalize these terms: if $P$ is a (bounded) convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^3$ , let $u\in S^2$ be a viewing direction. The silhouette of $P$ in the $u$ direction is the set of all vectors $v\perp u$ such that the line through $v+u$ and parallel to $u$ intersects the object. Two convex subsets $P, Q\in\mathbb{R}^3$ have the same silhouette profile if there is a rigid transformation $f:\mathbb{R}^3\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$ such that the set of all silhouettes of $f(P)$ is equal to the set of all silhouettes of $Q$ . The question is whether there are convex subsets $P,Q\subseteq \mathbb{R}^3$ that are not the same shape (not related by a rigid transformation), but have the same silhouette profile. (These definitions carry over to other dimensions with $\mathbb{R}^3$ replaced with $\mathbb{R}^n$ , and $S^2$ replaced with $S^{n-1}$ .) Edit: In order to entirely erase the viewing direction from the silhouette, I should quotient these silhouettes by the relation that considers silhouettes equivalent if they can be transformed into one another by a rigid transformation.","Informally, the silhouette of a 3D shape is a viewpoint-dependent 2D projection of it.

28,Eliminating unwanted branches of algebraic curves related to triangle centres,Eliminating unwanted branches of algebraic curves related to triangle centres,,"Lately I have become fascinated with triangle centres . To that end, I have written a small Python module that can compute explicit positions of centres for arbitrary triangles in the plane to arbitrary precision, based on the trilinear and barycentric coordinates in Kimberling's Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers (ETC). For certain combinations of triangles and centres, the sum of barycentric coordinates evaluates to $0$ and I have a point at infinity. To study those cases where a triangle centre leaves the friendly confines of the Euclidean plane for the line at infinity, I invented the notion of infinity curves. The infinity curve $\infty_n$ associated with the Kimberling triangle centre $X_n$ is the locus of points $(x,y)$ with $y\ne0$ and $(x,y)\ne(0,\pm\sqrt3)$ where the centre $X_n$ of the triangle with vertices $(-1,0),(1,0),(x,y)$ is a point at infinity. $\infty_n$ may be empty; I will ignore these cases here, as well as points that always lie on the line at infinity such as $X_{30}$ . For algebraic centres, which make up the vast majority of centres in the ETC, the associated infinity curves are also algebraic, and the problem then is to find an exact bivariate polynomial describing them. They can be derived by setting the sum of barycentric coordinates equal to zero, then expanding, simplifying and factoring. For example, the Exeter point $X_{22}$ has triangle centre function $a(b^4+c^4-a^4)$ , from which I derived $$\infty_{22}(x,y):3x^4 + 2x^2y^2 - 6x^2 - y^4 - 6y^2 + 3=0$$ Infinity curves can be visualised (or determined not to exist) for a given centre by making a complex plot of the centre's location for the triangles $(-1,0),(1,0),(x,y)$ with varying $z=x+yi$ . Here is such a plot for $X_{22}$ ; the infinity curve is white and marks discontinuities in the hue. The file infcurves has polynomials describing infinity curves up to $X_{70}$ (also the upper limit of the centres that can be computed by the Python module at the time of posting this question). However, I have been unable to fully reduce some of the polynomials to match the real appearance of their corresponding curves, and this is why I ask this question. Take for example $X_{29}$ with centre function $\frac{\sec A}{\cos B+\cos C}$ . Its complex plot looks like this, the infinity curve being a simple W-shape on the upper half-plane: The polynomial I have computed as $\infty_{29}$ , on the other hand, produces that and more: $$27 x^{16} + 144 x^{14} y^{2} - 216 x^{14} + 306 x^{12} y^{4} - 864 x^{12} y^{2} + 756 x^{12} + 324 x^{10} y^{6} - 1404 x^{10} y^{4} + 2160 x^{10} y^{2} - 1512 x^{10} + 171 x^{8} y^{8} - 1180 x^{8} y^{6} + 2430 x^{8} y^{4} - 2880 x^{8} y^{2} + 1890 x^{8} + 36 x^{6} y^{10} - 540 x^{6} y^{8} + 1480 x^{6} y^{6} - 1800 x^{6} y^{4} + 2160 x^{6} y^{2} - 1512 x^{6} - 132 x^{4} y^{10} + 530 x^{4} y^{8} - 600 x^{4} y^{6} + 270 x^{4} y^{4} - 864 x^{4} y^{2} + 756 x^{4} - 16 x^{2} y^{12} + 92 x^{2} y^{10} - 124 x^{2} y^{8} - 140 x^{2} y^{6} + 324 x^{2} y^{4} + 144 x^{2} y^{2} - 216 x^{2} + 4 y^{10} - 37 y^{8} + 116 y^{6} - 126 y^{4} + 27=0$$ This curve appears to be decomposable into four parts, one of which is the one I want.

The graph associated to the heptagons within distance $R$ of the origin, with edges between heptagons that overlap along an edge, has degree $\ge7$ at every ""interior"" vertex but (for sufficiently large $R$ ) insufficiently many exterior vertices to balance things out. This can be extended to any family of convex heptagons whose area and perimeter are bounded - see e.g. this thread on the /r/mathriddles subreddit for a more detailed proof. I am curious whether it is possible to tile the plane with convex heptagons which are similar to each other; I suspect it is impossible, but the above sort of argument seems to fail, because we cannot assume boundedness. Note that there do exist tilings of the plane by heptagons if we relax these boundedness constraints; for instance, one can take a tiling of the hyperbolic plane by heptagons in the disc model and apply a map $(r,\theta)\mapsto(\frac{r}{1-r},\theta)$ to yield a tiling of the whole plane (if we straighten out the edges after applying the transformation).
