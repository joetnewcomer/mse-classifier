Let $G$ be a non-abelian group of prime-power order $p^n$ and $E$ be an irreducible $G$-space over $\mathbb{C}$ giving a faithful representation of $G$. (i) Show that $G$ has a normal abelian subgroup $H$ which properly contains $Z(G)$. (ii) By complete reducibility, $E$ can be written as an $H$-direct sum $E=\bigoplus_{\psi}F_{\psi}$, where $F_{\psi}$ is the subspace of $E$ spanned by all 1-dimensional $H$-spaces with character $\psi$. Show that $E\neq F_{\psi}$ for any one $\psi$, using the facts that $Z(G)$ is a proper subgroup of $H$ and $E$ is faithful. (iii) Note that $G$ permutes the subspaces $F_{\psi}$ transitively. Fix $\psi$ and let $F=F_{\psi}$. Let $H_1$ be the stabiliser of $F$ under the action of $G$. Clearly $H\subset H_1$. Show that $F$ is irreducible as an $H_1$-space ad that $E$ is isomorphic to the induced representation space $i_!F$. (iv) What does (iii) imply about the (not necessarily faithful) irreducible representations of $G$? For (i), I've proved that $Z(G)$ has order $p^k$ where $1\leq k\leq n-2$ and that any $H\leq G$ containing $Z(G)$ of order $p^{k+1}$ must be abelian; all that's left is to prove $H$ is normal in $G$. I can't quite get my head around (ii): what relevance does $Z(G)$ have to representations of $G$? For (iii), since $H_1$ preserves $F$, $F$ is a representation of $H_1$, but why must it be irreducible? Proving it by inner products of characters doesn't look good; maybe we can prove that $H_1$ acts transitively on the 1-dimensional subspaces of $F$?

21,A problem concerning action via automorphisms,A problem concerning action via automorphisms,,"This problem asks to show that if $A$ acts on $G$ via automorphisms, where either $A$ or $G$ is soluble and both $A$ and $G$ are finite groups and $G$ is nontrivial, then $G$ possesses an $A$-invariant $p$-subgroup. My original attempt at a solution was this: If $G$ is soluble, then $F(G)>1$, in which case any nontrivial Sylow subgroup of $F(G)$, being characteristic all the way up to $G$, will do the trick. If $A$ is soluble, choose as above some Sylow $p$-subgroup of $F(A)$, say $P$. Certainly $P$ is normal in $A$ and my claim here is that there exists some $P$-invariant Sylow $q$-subgroup of G, regardless of the condition that $p$ divides $|G|$ or not. If $p$ does not divide $|G|$, then a direct appeal to the extended version of the Sylow theorems for coprime actions proves the claim. If $p$ divides $|G|$, then consider the action of $P$ on $Ω = Syl_p(G)$, which is nonempty. Then $|Ω| =$ sum of $P$-orbits, each a $p$-power, while $|Ω| = 1 (mod p)$. Some $P$-orbit must therefore be a singleton set, meaning that $P$ fixes this particular Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$. Thus, in all cases the claim holds. Now suppose that the $P$-invariant Sylow subgroup of $G$ is $Q$, where it's possible that $p$ divides $|Q|$. Then for any $u \in P$ and $a \in A$, $aua^{-1} \in P$. Hence $aua^{-1}(Q)=Q$, implying that $a(Q)Qa^{-1}(Q)=Q$. Thus $a(Q)$ is a subgroup of $N_G(Q)$ and also a Sylow $q$-subgroup of $G$, because $a$ (being an automorphism) maps Sylow subgroups to Sylow subgroups. Therefore $a(Q)$ is a member of $Syl_q(N_G(Q))$, the sole member of which is $Q$. Finally $a(Q)=Q$ for all $a \in A$ and we are done. The last paragraph contains an error, but I'm not sure what that is. I haven't used anywhere that $P>1$. But if $P$ is trivial, then $Q$ can be an arbitrary Sylow subgroup of $G$, and of course, $Q$ is not necessarily fixed by $A$.","This problem asks to show that if $A$ acts on $G$ via automorphisms, where either $A$ or $G$ is soluble and both $A$ and $G$ are finite groups and $G$ is nontrivial, then $G$ possesses an $A$-invariant $p$-subgroup. My original attempt at a solution was this: If $G$ is soluble, then $F(G)>1$, in which case any nontrivial Sylow subgroup of $F(G)$, being characteristic all the way up to $G$, will do the trick. If $A$ is soluble, choose as above some Sylow $p$-subgroup of $F(A)$, say $P$. Certainly $P$ is normal in $A$ and my claim here is that there exists some $P$-invariant Sylow $q$-subgroup of G, regardless of the condition that $p$ divides $|G|$ or not. If $p$ does not divide $|G|$, then a direct appeal to the extended version of the Sylow theorems for coprime actions proves the claim. If $p$ divides $|G|$, then consider the action of $P$ on $Ω = Syl_p(G)$, which is nonempty. Then $|Ω| =$ sum of $P$-orbits, each a $p$-power, while $|Ω| = 1 (mod p)$.

I'm wondering if maybe I've missed something on the way. If anyone could give it a look that would be great: We start by considering a subset $H=\lbrace\frac{p}{q}\in\mathbb Q| p\text{ is even and }q\text{ is odd}\rbrace$ . Naturally $0=\frac{0}{1}\in\mathbb Q$ , and for any $\frac{p}{q}\in H$ : $\frac{-p}{q}\in H$ . Also, if $\frac{p_1}{q_1},\frac{p_2}{q_2}\in H$ then $p_1q_2+p_2q_1$ is even, and $q_1q_2$ is odd, so $H$ is indeed a sub-group of $\mathbb Q$ (sorry for going into too much detail, as I said- I'm trying to make sure I didn't miss anything) So- what's $\mathbb{Q}/H$ ? Let's see what we've got: Let $r_1,r_2\in\mathbb{Q}$ be arbitrary. Write them down as $r_1=2^{t_1}\frac{p_1}{q_1}$ and $r_2=2^{t_2}\frac{p_2}{q_2}$ with $p_1,p_2,q_1,q_2$ all odd integers, and $t_1,t_2\in\mathbb{Z}$ We know that $$r_1=r_2\mod H\iff r_1-r_2\in H\iff \frac{2^{t_1}p_1q_2-2^{t_2}p_2q_1}{q_1q_2}\in H$$ WLOG assum $t_1\geq t_2$ then we have $$2^{t_2}\frac{2^{t_1-t_2}p_1q_2-p_2q_1}{q_1q_1}\in H$$ From here on I notice two cases: Case 1 : If $t_2>0$ than this is always true- meaning that any two elements of $\mathbb{Q}$ with a positive diadic valuation are congruent under $H$ (since $t_1\geq t_2>0$ ). EDIT - Not very suprising, as any element of positive diadic valuation is $0_{\mathbb Q/H}$ , by definition (Thanks to Brian for mentioning this). Case 2 : (and this is what's got me baffled) If $t_2\leq 0$ we need $2^{t_1-t_2}p_1q_2-p_2q_1$ to be an even integer, such that $2^{-t_2}$ divides it, for this number to be in $H$ . Since $p_2q_1$ is odd, it must hold that $2^{t_1-t_2}=1$ so $t_1=t_2$ . Also we have that $2^{-t_2}|p_1q_2-p_2q_1$ . Basically this is where I got stuck- what's the deal with Case 2 ?

Let $\rho \in \operatorname{Irr}(H)$ and $\psi \in \operatorname{Irr}(K)$ be such that $\rho \mid_{H\cap K}$ and $\psi\mid_{H\cap K}$ share an irreducible constituent. Prove that there exists a unique $\chi \in \operatorname{Irr}(G)$ such that $\chi \mid_H = \psi(1)\rho$ and $\chi \mid_K = \rho(1) \psi$ . My attempt Let $\phi: H \times K \to G$ be such that $\phi(h, k) = hk$ . It's clear that $\phi$ is a surjective homomorphism. In particular, if $N = \ker \phi = \{(h, h^{-1}) \mid h \in H \cap K\}$ , we can identify $G$ with a quotient of the direct product, meaning we can use lifting to obtain the character $\chi$ ; that is to say, the desired character will be induced by an irreducible character of $H \times K$ with $N$ contained in its kernel. Any irreducible character of $H \times K$ is of the form $\alpha \times \beta$ , for $\alpha \in \operatorname{Irr}(H)$ and $\beta \in \operatorname{Irr}(K)$ . And $N \subset \ker (\alpha \times \beta)$ iff $\alpha(h)\beta(h^{-1}) = \alpha(1)\beta(1)$ for all $h \in H \cap K$ . This is, in turn, equivalent to saying $\alpha(h) = m \omega_h$ and $\beta(h) = n \omega_h$ , for some $o(h)$ -root of unity $\omega_h \in \mathbb{C}$ , for each $h \in H \cap K$ . The existence would be established, then, if we could prove $N \subset \ker (\rho \times \psi)$ . Since they have a common constituent, we know: $$ \langle \rho \mid_{H \cap K}, \psi \mid_{H \cap K} \rangle = \frac{1}{|H \cap K|} \sum_{h \in H \cap K} \rho(h)\psi(h^{-1}) \neq 0$$ If we knew $N \subset \ker(\rho \times \psi)$ , then the above sum would reduce to $\rho(1)\psi(1)$ . At the same time, since $H \cap K$ is abelian, $\rho(1)$ is the number of irreducible constituents of $\rho \mid_{H \cap K}$ . So $\rho$ and $\psi$ have $\rho(1)\psi(1)$ constituents in common, while $\rho$ has $\rho(1)$ constituents. This means $\psi(1) = 1$ . The same logic applied to $\psi$ yields $\rho(1) = 1$ , meaning $\rho \mid_{H \cap K} = \psi \mid_{H \cap K}$ .

43,A group generated by two elements with uncountably many normal subgroups,A group generated by two elements with uncountably many normal subgroups,,"Proposition. There exists a group generated by two elements with uncountably many normal subgroups. The constructive proof below appears in Geometric Group Theory: An Introduction by Clara Löh (Proposition $2.2.30$ ). Proof. The basic idea is as follows: We construct a group $G$ generated by two elements that contains a central subgroup $C$ (i.e., each element of this subgroup is fixed under conjugation by all other group elements) isomorphic to the big additive group $\bigoplus_{\Bbb N} \Bbb Z$ . The group $C$ contains uncountably many subgroups (e.g., given by taking subgroups generated by the subsystem of the unit vectors corresponding to different subsets of $\Bbb N$ ), and all these subgroups of $C$ are normal in $G$ because $C$ is central in $G$ . What is the explanation for why $\bigoplus_{\Bbb N} \Bbb Z$ has uncountable many subgroups? I don't understand the stuff about the ""subsystem of unit vectors"" corresponding to subsets of $\Bbb N$ . An example of such a group is $G := \langle s,t \, \vert \, R\rangle$ , where $$R := \{[[s,t^nst^{-n}],s]: n \in \Bbb Z\} \cup \{[[s,t^nst^{-n}],t]: n \in \Bbb Z\}$$ Let $C$ be the subgroup of $G$ generated by the set $\{[s,t^nst^{-n}]]: n \in \Bbb Z\}$ . All elements of $C$ are invariant under conjugation with $s$ by the first part of the relations, and they are invariant under conjugation with $t$ by the second part of the relations; thus, $C$ is central in $G$ . Moreover, using the so-called calculus of commutators, it can be shown that $C$ contains the additive group $\bigoplus_{\Bbb N} \Bbb Z$ . For the last part, we must construct an injective group homomorphism $\varphi: \bigoplus_{\Bbb N} \Bbb Z \to C$ . It is enough to define $\varphi$ on a generating set of $\bigoplus_{\Bbb N} \Bbb Z$ , for which the ideal pick is $S := \{e_n: n \in \Bbb N\}$ where $e_n = (0, \ldots, 0, 1, 0, \ldots)$ has a $1$ in the $n$ th coordinate and $0$ s elsewhere for each $n\ge 1$ . The relations in $G$ can be rewritten as $[st^nst^{-n}s^{-1}t^ns^{-1}t^{-n},s] = e_G$ and $[st^nst^{-n}s^{-1}t^ns^{-1}t^{-n},t] = e_G$ for all $n \in \Bbb Z$ where $e_G \in G$ is the identity element.

The constructive proof below appears in Geometric Group Theory: An Introduction by Clara Löh (Proposition ). Proof. The basic idea is as follows: We construct a group generated by two elements that contains a central subgroup (i.e., each element of this subgroup is fixed under conjugation by all other group elements) isomorphic to the big additive group . The group contains uncountably many subgroups (e.g., given by taking subgroups generated by the subsystem of the unit vectors corresponding to different subsets of ), and all these subgroups of are normal in because is central in . What is the explanation for why has uncountable many subgroups? I don't understand the stuff about the ""subsystem of unit vectors"" corresponding to subsets of . An example of such a group is , where Let be the subgroup of generated by the set . All elements of are invariant under conjugation with by the first part of the relations, and they are invariant under conjugation with by the second part of the relations; thus, is central in . Moreover, using the so-called calculus of commutators, it can be shown that contains the additive group . For the last part, we must construct an injective group homomorphism . It is enough to define on a generating set of , for which the ideal pick is where has a in the th coordinate and s elsewhere for each . The relations in can be rewritten as and for all where is the identity element. How should I define ? I don't see why the commutators and are useful to consider in the first place.

I could prove the fact that the set underlying a $G$ -torsor $\bar T$ is isomorphic to the set underlying $G$ , the so called trivialization of $\bar T$ . But then remark 2.13 stumped me. Before I proceed, some context of the notations, definitions and results. A $G$ -torsor $\bar T$ is a set $T$ and a group action $a:G\times T\to T$ such that the map $a\times \pi_2:G\times T\to T\times T$ is an isomorphism (where $\pi_2:G\times T\to T$ is the natural projection on the second coordinate). Then a theorem says that given $T$ is nonempty, then the set underlying $G$ is isomorphic to $T$ , and such an isomorphism is called a trivialization. Let $\rho:G\to T$ be a trivialization. Now onto the problems. They define a 'division' among the elements of $T$ by the map $$d:=\pi_{1} \circ \left( \rho^{-1} \times id \right): T \times T \rightarrow G \times T \rightarrow G$$ which seems kind of fine, yet iffy to me for the following reason. It seems fine because we can assume that the trivialization $\rho$ comes from the choice of some element $t\in T$ , we can identity $\rho$ with $t$ itself, and call the map $t$ (sloppy language for sure, but helps me visualize what's going on, maybe). Then, $d(t_1,\ t_2)=\pi_1\circ (t^{-1}\times id)(t_1,\ t_2)=\pi_1(t^{-1}(t_1),t_2)=t^{-1}(t_1)$ which looks like division for sure, but we have forgotten the element $t_2$ altogether. Something fishy is going on, or I am being dumb. So question 1 : Am I thinking correctly? If yes, where does the element $t_2$ vanish? If not, then what is the correct interpretation of said map? Moving on, they define $$D:=\rho\circ d:T\times T\to T$$ and call this a 'division structure on $T$ '. Question 2 : What is a division structure on a set? Maybe the answer lies in the answer of question 1, but I am really lost. Finally, the map $D$ looks very odd.

This result is stated as follows: Theorem 1 Every finite group $G$ of size $|G| \geq 3$ has a generating set $S$ of size $|S| \leq \log_2 |G|$ , such that the corresponding Cayley graph $\Gamma(G, S)$ contains a Hamiltonian cycle.

Then the Cayley graph $\Gamma = \Gamma(G, \{\alpha, \beta\})$ contains a Hamiltonian cycle. In other words, note that the product of the generators above is an involution. In the proof for Theorem 2 , the authors invoke the use of Lemma 3 as follows: It is a well known consequence from the classification of finite simple groups, that every non-Abelian finite simple group can be generated by two elements, one of which is an involution. Therefore Lemma 3 is applicable, and for every non-Abelian finite simple group produces a generating set $S$ , with $|S| = 2$ , such that the corresponding Cayley graph contains a Hamiltonian cycle. Finally, I can state my question in full: Lemma 3 requires that the product of the generators to be an involution, however we are only given that one of the generators is an involution; is the product necessarily an involution then?

In the proof for Theorem 2 , the authors invoke the use of Lemma 3 as follows: It is a well known consequence from the classification of finite simple groups, that every non-Abelian finite simple group can be generated by two elements, one of which is an involution. Therefore Lemma 3 is applicable, and for every non-Abelian finite simple group produces a generating set , with , such that the corresponding Cayley graph contains a Hamiltonian cycle. Finally, I can state my question in full: Lemma 3 requires that the product of the generators to be an involution, however we are only given that one of the generators is an involution; is the product necessarily an involution then? How exactly is Lemma 3 invoked? Many thanks for your time and for reading this far! :-)","G = \langle a, b\rangle a c, d G =

It seems to me that if we have two groups $G,H$ of same order and $G$ has a subgroup of order $n$ and $H$ has no subgroup of order $n$ , then we can't have an isomorphism. Now, suppose that we have two subgroups $G,H$ and they have the same quantity of subgroups $G_1,\dots,G_n$ and $H_1,\dots,H_n$ and $|G_i|=|H_i|$ does this means we have an isomorphism?
