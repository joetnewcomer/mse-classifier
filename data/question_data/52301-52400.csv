I was using this site to get an overall intuition for the relationship between integrals and derivatives. It seems clear how a cube changes in that the derivative is like adding 3 areas so that it grows by $3x^2$ . And the reverse is just integrating the rate to get the cube $x^3 + c$ . Now my confusion is when we consider movement. Acceleration has units in $m/s^2$ but velocity is not cubed (at least in my understanding).

32,Evaluating $\Gamma$-function at $x=1/2$,Evaluating -function at,\Gamma x=1/2,"I was following an explanation of the gamma function and everything made sense until the author evaluated the function at 1/2. The $\Gamma$ -function is defined as the following integral: $$\Gamma(x)=\int_0^\infty x^{n-1}e^{-x}\,dx$$ And now evaluating $\Gamma$ ( $1/2$ ) we get: $$\Gamma(1/2)=\int_0^\infty x^{-1/2} e^{-x} \, dx$$ This is further simplified by setting $x=y^2$ and therefore $dx=2y\,dy$ . From this, we can get the following integral: $$2\int_0^\infty e^{-y^2}\,dy$$ This next step is where I am confused. The author proceeds to make the following equality: $$2\int_0^\infty e^{-y^2}\,dy = 2\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} \, dx$$ I don't understand how this equality is reached. Doesn't this mean $\int_0^\infty x^{-1/2}e^{-x} \, dx$ is equal to $2\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} \, dx$ ? Does it have something to do with the bounds?

Explain why $f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt x}$ is Lebesgue integrable over $(0,1]$ . It is clear that $f$ is a decreasing, non-negative function.

Broadly speaking, I understand that the “problem” with this function is that $f(0)$ is undefined and as $x \to 0$ , $f(x)$ gets very big.

This is a nice intuitive explanation, but it doesn't explain what $\mathrm{d}x$ is. Attempting to read the definition of a differential gives a very broad and general definition that does not seem to be immediately applicable to integrals. However, these $\mathrm{d}$-things appear in different settings as well, such as probability theory  $$ \int_{\mathbb{R}} \mathrm{d}F(x) $$ and differential equations (and variable substitution) $$ \frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x} = x \iff \mathrm{d}y = x\,\mathrm{d}x \iff \int\mathrm{d}y = \int x\,\mathrm{d}x $$ with no apparent connection to the original $\Delta x$.

Is it just a historical artefact, or is it possible to assign some intuition and purposeful meaning to $\mathrm{d}x$ without appealing to too abstract concepts in differential geometry? Maybe a simplified version that's easily explained and applicable to integrals. It seems clear that in some cases this cannot be remedied by making an alternative integration function ${\Large\mathcal{I}}$, as there are fields where $\mathrm{d}x$ does appear to have some meaning: $$ \int_{\partial\Omega}\omega = \int_\Omega \mathrm{d}\omega $$ (unless this is just deceivingly similar notation to normal integration.) So how can one motivate the usage of $\mathrm{d}$ that is accessible when one first encounters integrals, but does not cause confusion when encountering it later?
