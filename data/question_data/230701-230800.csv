I, then, consider the set $R = \mathbb{N} - S = \{x\in \mathbb{N} \; \vert \; x\notin S\}$. The proof follows with proving $R = \mathbb{N}$ via induction: $0\in R$, because, otherwise, $S$ would have a minimum (because $0\leq n \; \forall n \in  \mathbb{N}$). I suppose that every $k<n$ is in $R$ (i.e. every $k<n$ isn't in $S$). If $n$ was to be in $S$, $S$ would have a minimal element. Therefore, $n \in R$.

Prove that $A \sim C$ What I have: We know there exists functions $f,g$ such that $f:A\to B$ and $g:B \to C$ where $f$ and $g$ are bijective. We thus require to show that there exists a function $h:A \to C$ where $h$ is bijective. Can anyone please give me some hints that might point me in the right direction? I do not want a complete answer, simply a nudge in the right direction. UPDATE: This is my (very rough) attempt at the proof. We know there exists functions $f,g$ such that $f:A\to B$ and $g:B \to C$ where $f$ and $g$ are bijective. We thus require to show that there exists a function $h:A \to C$ where $h$ is bijective. Assume that $h(x) = g \circ f = g(f(x))$ . We must now show that $h$ is bijective. $\underline{RTP:}$ If $f$ and $g$ are surjective, then $g \circ f$ is surjective. $\underline{Proof:}$ We are given that $f$ and $g$ are surjective (since they are bijective). Suppose $c \in C$ , then since $g$ is surjective, we know $\exists b \in B$ such that $g(b) = c$ . Similarly, since $f$ is surjective, $\exists a \in A$ such that $f(a) = b$ . Thus \begin{align}g \circ f(a) &= g(f(a))  \\ &= g(b) \\ &= c\end{align} Hence we have shown that $h$ is surjective. We must now show that $h$ is injective. $\underline{RTP:}$ If $f$ snd $g$ are injective, then $g\circ f$ is also injective. $\underline{Proof:}$ We are given that $f$ and $g$ are injective (since they are bijective) and suppose $$g \circ f(x_1) = g \circ f(x_2)$$ We thus have that $$g(f(x_1))= g(f(x_2))$$ Since $g$ is injective, we know that this is true if and only if $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ . Similarly, since $f$ is injective, it follows that $$x_1 = x_2$$ Thus $g \circ f$ is injective. We have thus proven that there exists a function $h(x)= g \circ f : A \to C$ that is bijective.

Assume $f(x) \in \omega \ \ \forall x \in R(\alpha)$, and let $x' \in R(\alpha + 1)$. Now $x' \subset R(\alpha)$ so for any $y \in x'$ we would have $f(y) \in \omega$, and thus $f(x') = \sum_{y\in x'} 2^{f(y)} \in \omega$. Uniqueness Also by induction: Assume $f, g$ both satisfy the criterion. We have $f(0) = 0 = g(0)$. Assume $f(x) = g(x) \ \ \forall x \in R(\alpha)$, and let $x' \in R(\alpha + 1)$. Again we would have $x' \subset R(\alpha)$, and thus $f(x') = \sum_{y\in x'} 2^{f(y)} = \sum_{y\in x'} 2^{g(y)} = g(x')$, so $f(x) = g(x) \ \ \forall x \in R(\omega)$. Prove $f$ is a bijection Given an $\alpha \in \omega$, we can write it as $\alpha = 2^{m_1} + \dots + 2^{m_k}$, $m_1 < \dots < m_k$, where $m_i \in \omega \ \ \forall i$. We then have that $x = \{m_1, \dots , m_k\} \subset R(m_k + 1)$ which means that $x \in R(m_k+2)$. Thus we have found $x \in R(\omega)$ s.t. $f(x) = \alpha$, and $f$ is surjective. Assume $f(x_1) = f(x_2) = \alpha = 2^{m_1} + \dots + 2^{m_k}$, then we must have $$f(x_1) = \sum_{y\in x_1} 2^{f(y)} = 2^{m_1} + \dots + 2^{m_k} = \sum_{y\in x_2} 2^{f(y)} = f(x_2),$$ and we must have $x_1 = \{m_1, \dots , m_k\} = x_2$, so $f$ is injective.

The problem - Part A - Show that there is one, and only one, function $f: R(\omega) \to \omega$ satisfying $$f(x) = \sum_{y\in x} 2^{f(y)}$$ for each $x \in R(\omega)$. Here $R(\omega)$ is the first infinite level in the cumulative hierarchy. Show that this function is a bijection. - Part B - Find a function $g : \omega \to \omega$ such that for all $n$ and $m$ in $\omega$ and for $x$ and $y$ in $R(\omega)$ with $n = f(x)$ and $m = f(y)$ we have that $$f(\langle x, y\rangle) = g(n,m).$$ My attempt at a solution Existence of function By induction: We have $f(0) = 0 \in \omega$. Assume $f(x) \in \omega \ \ \forall x \in R(\alpha)$, and let $x' \in R(\alpha + 1)$. Now $x' \subset R(\alpha)$ so for any $y \in x'$ we would have $f(y) \in \omega$, and thus $f(x') = \sum_{y\in x'} 2^{f(y)} \in \omega$. Uniqueness Also by induction: Assume $f, g$ both satisfy the criterion. We have $f(0) = 0 = g(0)$. Assume $f(x) = g(x) \ \ \forall x \in R(\alpha)$, and let $x' \in R(\alpha + 1)$. Again we would have $x' \subset R(\alpha)$, and thus $f(x') = \sum_{y\in x'} 2^{f(y)} = \sum_{y\in x'} 2^{g(y)} = g(x')$, so $f(x) = g(x) \ \ \forall x \in R(\omega)$. Prove $f$ is a bijection Given an $\alpha \in \omega$, we can write it as $\alpha = 2^{m_1} + \dots + 2^{m_k}$, $m_1 < \dots < m_k$, where $m_i \in \omega \ \ \forall i$. We then have that $x = \{m_1, \dots , m_k\} \subset R(m_k + 1)$ which means that $x \in R(m_k+2)$. Thus we have found $x \in R(\omega)$ s.t. $f(x) = \alpha$, and $f$ is surjective. Assume $f(x_1) = f(x_2) = \alpha = 2^{m_1} + \dots + 2^{m_k}$, then we must have $$f(x_1) = \sum_{y\in x_1} 2^{f(y)} = 2^{m_1} + \dots + 2^{m_k} = \sum_{y\in x_2} 2^{f(y)} = f(x_2),$$ and we must have $x_1 = \{m_1, \dots , m_k\} = x_2$, so $f$ is injective. Find the function $g$ Not solved. Any help appreciated!",,['elementary-set-theory']

87,"Can we use proper classes in this way, to define a new infinity larger than |Ord|?","Can we use proper classes in this way, to define a new infinity larger than |Ord|?",,"I believe there is a way to do this that makes sense, and I explain it below. I would like to know if I did some obvious  mistake, or if the idea doesn't make sense for some reason I didn't figure it out. We can generalize the idea of an ordinal number in the same way we did it to expand $\mathbb{N}$ to $\omega$ and beyond.  Basically, you get the ordinals when you define a limit to the infinite sequence $1,2,...n,...$ which in its most naive definition has no limit, and call it $\omega$. Now we put one $\omega$ after another, in the same way that we had put one natural number after another, and we get not only countable infinite sets of various cofinalities, but we also reach uncountable sets. And not only of cardinality $2^{\omega}$, but also of any large cardinality (if we use the standard definition of cardinal).  But we still reach a ""limit"". The limit is |V| (or |Ord|), the proper class of all ordinals. So, somehow, the infinities within ZFC (or most other popular variants of set theory) reach a limit, in the same sense that the naturals reach $\omega$. So what happens if we put two proper classes one after another? (actually, we should start with a proper class and a set, one after another, and get $|V|+1, |V|+2, ... , |V|+|V|=|V|. 2, ...$ etc). We can try to name these infinities in the same way as we did with the transfinite ordinals (either countable or uncountable ones). Doing this gets infinities well beyond |V| (and presumably without any paradox). They are not sets, or course, they are other kind of object that generalizes what a set is. In the same way that an infinite ordinal  generalizes what  a natural number is (they are perhaps not proper classes either, but just put them a new name).  Could we say that |V| is a fixed point of the power set operator? (you cannot reach |V|+1 from |V| within ZFC, I guess, or you can, but you would need to use some non-standard model, by analogy with the non-standard models of PA).  Even if we do so, we will end up reaching some new limit, or fixed point. And when we reach it,  we can start all over again. So we can have a hierarchy of theories that can reach higher and higher infinities. Each theory has a fixed point, in the sense that the point is the ""infinity class"" that the standard model of the theory can reach. Let us call them $S^n$, with $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Then, roughly:  $S^0=PA$ (can reach $\omega$), $S^1=ZFC$ (can reach |Ord|), $S^2=?$ (reaches beyond the standard ordinals), ...., . But we can keep doing this forever, and define a new theory that is the limit of all previous theories. And so on, ad nauseam...
