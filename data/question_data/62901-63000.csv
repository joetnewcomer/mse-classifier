2,How Many Ways to Build a 6-Pack,How Many Ways to Build a 6-Pack,,"There is a beverage company here that claims to have a selection of 200 different beers. They have a special deal where you can build your own six pack at a discount. They advertise that there are 1.4B ways to build said six pack, and I am trying to determine if they're correct. I thought that this would be a combination with repetition problem. You have $n=200$ items with $r=6$ choices. The formula $$x=(n+r-1)!/(r!(n-1)!)$$ yields $x=95,746,959,700$. Then I tried to work backwards using $x=1400000000$. I plugged $$1400000000=n!(n-1)!(n-2)!(n-3)!(n-4)!(n-5)!$$ into Wolfram Alpha to get the solution. It showed that the alternate form is a gamma function $$1400000000 = Γ(x-4)Γ(x-3)Γ(x-2)Γ(x-1)Γ(x)Γ(x+1)$$ That solution is approximately $n=6.496$.

One easy exercise is to show that $$ p(n) \geq 2^{\lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor}$$ for all $n > 1.$ The bound is rather stupid since one just takes a subset of $\{1,\ldots,\lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor \}$ and assigns to it a partition of $n$ in the natural way.

43,Jugs of Water Puzzle: Minimum Number of Operations,Jugs of Water Puzzle: Minimum Number of Operations,,"PUZZLE. Given two water jugs with capacities $a, b \in \mathbb{N}$ , the goal is to measure exactly $c$ units of water only performing the following operations: fill one of the jugs to it's capacity limit, empty one of the jugs, fill water from one jug to the other until the first jug is empty or the second jug is full. This puzzle is well-known and the special case $a = 5, b = 3, c = 4$ was originally featured in the movie Die Hard 3:  With a Vengeance . It can be easily solved by brute-force in a few steps. We call a triplet $(a, b, c)$ an instance . A sequence of operations as described above is called a solution , if after performing all these operations in order one of the jugs contains exactly $c$ units water. If there is no solution requiring strictly fewer operations, a solution is called optimal . Naturally, there are two questions in this puzzles context: Existence : Given an instance $(a, b, c)$ , is it possible to measure exactly $c$ units of water using a sequence of the operations described above? [solved below] Optimality : Find an optimal solution. How? Both problems can be solved algorithmically by BFS. There are at $a + 1$ possible amounts the first jug can contain and $b + 1$ amounts for the second jug. Hence, we have $(a + 1)(b + 1) \in \mathcal{O}(ab)$ possible states. When considering large capacities and instances with only quite long solutions, space and time complexity issues arise. Thus, I search for a more efficient approach. It is clear that the amount of water in each jug is always an integer linear combination $s \cdot a + t \cdot b$ of the capacities $a$ and $b$ . It can also be shown that every such integer linear combination can be reached (up to the exception of exceeding capacity limits, let's assume $c \le \max(a, b)$ and $a \le b$ wlog). By Bezout's Lemma, if every linear combination is reachable, we are able to measure $c$ units of water iff $gcd(a, b) \mid c$ . To do so, we use the following algorithm: fill the first jug transfer from first jug to second jug if one of the jugs contains exactly $c$ units water: terminate, solution found, else continue with step 4. if the second jug is full: empty it and transfer from second to first jug go to step 1 We execute this algorithm twice: In the first run, 'first jug' means the jug with capacity $a$ . In the second run, 'first jug' means the jug with capacity $b$ . After both runs, we take the solution requiring the minimum number of operations. EXAMPLE . Let's work through the instance $(5, 3, 4)$ from the movie. The algorithm yields: 1st run: $(0, 0) \rightarrow_1 (5, 0) \rightarrow_2 (2, 3) \rightarrow_4 (2, 0) \rightarrow_4 (0, 2) \rightarrow_1 (5, 2) \rightarrow_2 (4, 3)$ 2nd run: $(0, 0) \rightarrow_1 (0, 3) \rightarrow_2 (3, 0) \rightarrow_1 (3, 3) \rightarrow_2 (5, 1) \rightarrow_4 (0, 1) \rightarrow_4 (1, 0) \rightarrow_1 (1, 3) \rightarrow_2 (4, 0)$ Note that each pair $(p, q)$ means that the jug with capacity $a = 5$ contains $p$ units of water and jug with capacity $b = 3$ contains $q$ units. An arrow $\rightarrow_k$ denotes a transition (step $k$ ) as given by the algorithm. QUESTION. Is this algorithm always optimal and why?

53,Is it possible to solve sudoku without backtracking?,Is it possible to solve sudoku without backtracking?,,"I occasionally solve sudoku puzzles on smartphone in spare time. My approach is based on the belief that at each stage in solving a sudoku puzzle there is at least one cell where there in only one choice of digit which satisfies all the constraints . And then I proceed to find one such cell and fill it with the suitable unique digit. This way the problem looks deterministic. Some other approaches use backtracking. This is typically used when you have a cell which has two choices of digits based on current data and you put one of the choices in the cell and after sometime if you discover any contradiction, you backtrack and fill the cell with other choice. If there is a sudoku puzzle with unique solution then can it be shown that there is at least one cell at each stage of the puzzle which has only one choice of the digit without using any backtracking? In other words will the following procedure work? Start with any empty cell. Eliminate the digits which are not suitable for that cell by looking in the row, column and the smaller square to which the cell belongs. If there is only one digit which fits this cell then fill it with that digit. If there are multiple options move to another cell and repeat the same logic. It is guaranteed that you will have one cell with only one choice of suitable digit. This way fill all the empty cells.

Wilf. Let $f(n,m,k)$ be the number of strings of $n$ $\,0$'s and $1$'s that contain exactly     $m\,$ $1$'s, no $k$ of which are consecutive. (a) Find a recurrence formula for $f$. It should have $f(n,m,k)$ on the left side, and exactly three terms on the right. (b) Find, in simple closed form, the generating functions $$ F_k(x,y)=\sum_{n,m\ge0}f(n,m,k)x^ny^m \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\ (k=1,2,...). $$ (c) Find an explicit formula for $f(n,m,k)$ from the genrating function (this should involve only a single summation, of an expression that involves a few factorials). I was able to solve (a) and (b) and found that the generating functions is $$ F_k = \frac{1-x^ky^k}{1-x-xy-x^{k+1}y^k} $$ However, I cannot seem to be able to extract the sequence from this function. Any help will be appreciated. Edit: I've added the way I solved (a) and (b) to allow any criticism in case I got the function wrong. My solution to (a) goes as follows: Given $m,n,k$ such that $0\le k\le m \le n$ and $k\lt n$, we look at all of the bit string of length $n$ that contain exactly $m$ $1$'s, no $k$ of which are consecutive. We split these strings into two sets. The first composed of all the strings that end with $0$. This set has  $f(n-1,m, k)$ strings since by removing the $0$ from the end of the string we obtain a  one to one correspondence between the strings in our set and the strings $f(n-1,m, k)$ counts. The other set is composed of all the strings that end with $1$. By removing the last bit we obtain a one to one correspondence between our set and all strings counted by $f(n-1,m-1, k)$, except those that have $k-1$ consecutive $1$'s at the end. To count the latter we first note that since $k\lt n$ there must be another bit, which  must be $0$, before the last $k-1$ $\,1$'s. By removing the last $k$ bits ($10\cdots0$) we obtain a one to one correspondence with the strings that are counted by $f(n-k-1,\,m-k,\,k)$. With that we obtain the recursion: $$f(n,m,k) = f(n-1,m,k) + f(n-1,m-1,k) - f(n-k-1,\,m-k,\,k)$$  In addition, we note the if $0\le m \le n$ and $k > m$, then $f(n,m,k) = \binom{n}m$ , since we can't have more consecutive $1$'s than there are $1$'s, so the problem is reduced to counting the number of strings with length $n$ that have $m$ $1$'s. For all other cases we write $f(n,m,k) = 0$ which completes the definition. To Solve (b) I did the following: $$ \begin{align} F_k(x,y) & = \sum_{n,m\ge0}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m \\ & = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\sum_{m=0}^{n}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m \\ & = \sum_{n=0}^{k-1}\sum_{m=0}^{n}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m + \sum_{n=k}^{\infty}\sum_{m=0}^{k-1}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m + \sum_{n=k}^{\infty}\sum_{m=k}^{n}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m \\ & = \sum_{n=0}^{k-1}\sum_{m=0}^{n}\binom{n}m x^n y^m + \sum_{n=k}^{\infty}\sum_{m=0}^{k-1}\binom{n}m x^n y^m + \sum_{n=k}^{\infty}\sum_{m=k}^{n}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m \end{align} $$ By using the convention that $\binom{n}m = 0$ when $m\gt n$, and noting that when $m=n\ge k$ we have $f(n,m,k)=0$ we can write the above equation as follows: $$ \begin{align} & \sum_{m=0}^{k-1}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\binom{n}m x^n y^m + \sum_{n=k+1}^{\infty}\sum_{m=k}^{n-1}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m \\ =& \sum_{m=0}^{k-1} \frac{x^m}{(1-x)^{m+1}} y^m + \sum_{n=k+1}^{\infty}\sum_{m=k}^{n-1}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m \\ =& \frac{1}{1-x} \cdot \omega(x,y) + \sum_{n=k+1}^{\infty}\sum_{m=k}^{n-1}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m  \end{align} $$ where: $$\omega(x,y) := \frac{1 - (\frac{xy}{1-x})^k}{1 - \frac{xy}{1-x}}.$$ Using the recusion formula obtained in (a) we can expand the second summand like so: $$ \begin{align} \sum_{n=k+1}^{\infty}\sum_{m=k}^{n-1}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m & = A + B - C  \end{align} $$ where: $$ \begin{align} A & =\sum_{n=k+1}^{\infty}\sum_{m=k}^{n-1}f(n-1,m,k) x^n y^m \\ & = x\sum_{n=k}^{\infty}\sum_{m=k}^{n}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m \\ & = x\left(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\sum_{m=0}^{n}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m -  \sum_{n=0}^{k-1}\sum_{m=0}^{n}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m - \sum_{n=k}^{\infty}\sum_{m=0}^{k-1}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m \right)\\ & = x\left(F_k(x,y) -  \sum_{n=0}^{k-1}\sum_{m=0}^{n}\binom{n}m x^n y^m - \sum_{n=k}^{\infty}\sum_{m=0}^{k-1}\binom{n}m x^n y^m \right)\\ & = x\left(F_k(x,y) -  \sum_{m=0}^{k-1}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\binom{n}m x^n y^m\right)\\ & = xF_k(x,y) - \frac{x}{1-x} \cdot \omega(x,y)\\ \\ B & =\sum_{n=k+1}^{\infty}\sum_{m=k}^{n-1}f(n-1,m-1,k) x^n y^m \\ & = xy\sum_{n=k}^{\infty}\sum_{m=k-1}^{n-1}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m \\ & = xy\left(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\sum_{m=0}^{n}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m -  \sum_{n=0}^{k-1}\sum_{m=0}^{n}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m - \sum_{n=k}^{\infty}\sum_{m=0}^{k-2}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m \right)\\ & = xy\left(F_k(x,y) -  \sum_{n=0}^{k-1}\sum_{m=0}^{n}\binom{n}m x^n y^m - \sum_{n=k}^{\infty}\sum_{m=0}^{k-2}\binom{n}m x^n y^m \right)\\ & = xy\left(F_k(x,y) -  \sum_{m=0}^{k-2}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\binom{n}m x^n y^m - x^{k-1}y^{k-1}\right)\\ & = xyF_k(x,y) -  xy\sum_{m=0}^{k-2}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\binom{n}m x^n y^m - x^ky^k\\ & = xyF_k(x,y) -  xy\sum_{m=0}^{k-2}\frac{x^m}{(1-x)^{m+1}} y^m - x^ky^k\\ & = xyF_k(x,y) + 1 - \omega(x,y) - x^ky^k\\ \\ C & =\sum_{n=k+1}^{\infty}\sum_{m=k}^{n-1}f(n-k-1,\,m-k,\,k) x^n y^m = x^{k+1}y^kF_k(x,y) \end{align} $$ Summing all the values we get: $$ F_k = \frac{1}{1-x} \cdot \omega + xF_k - \frac{x}{1-x} \cdot \omega + xyF_k + 1 - \omega - x^ky^k - x^{k+1}y^kF_k $$ And so (note that $\omega$ disappears): $$ F_k = \frac{1-x^ky^k}{1-x-xy-x^{k+1}y^k} $$","The following problem is taken from the book generatingfunctionology (P.28) by Herbert S.

(b) Find, in simple closed form, the generating functions $$ F_k(x,y)=\sum_{n,m\ge0}f(n,m,k)x^ny^m \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\ (k=1,2,...). $$ (c) Find an explicit formula for $f(n,m,k)$ from the genrating function (this should involve only a single summation, of an expression that involves a few factorials). I was able to solve (a) and (b) and found that the generating functions is $$ F_k = \frac{1-x^ky^k}{1-x-xy-x^{k+1}y^k} $$ However, I cannot seem to be able to extract the sequence from this function. Any help will be appreciated. Edit: I've added the way I solved (a) and (b) to allow any criticism in case I got the function wrong. My solution to (a) goes as follows: Given $m,n,k$ such that $0\le k\le m \le n$ and $k\lt n$, we look at all of the bit string of length $n$ that contain exactly $m$ $1$'s, no $k$ of which are consecutive. We split these strings into two sets. The first composed of all the strings that end with $0$. This set has  $f(n-1,m, k)$ strings since by removing the $0$ from the end of the string we obtain a  one to one correspondence between the strings in our set and the strings $f(n-1,m, k)$ counts. The other set is composed of all the strings that end with $1$. By removing the last bit we obtain a one to one correspondence between our set and all strings counted by $f(n-1,m-1, k)$, except those that have $k-1$ consecutive $1$'s at the end. To count the latter we first note that since $k\lt n$ there must be another bit, which  must be $0$, before the last $k-1$ $\,1$'s. By removing the last $k$ bits ($10\cdots0$) we obtain a one to one correspondence with the strings that are counted by $f(n-k-1,\,m-k,\,k)$. With that we obtain the recursion: $$f(n,m,k) = f(n-1,m,k) + f(n-1,m-1,k) - f(n-k-1,\,m-k,\,k)$$  In addition, we note the if $0\le m \le n$ and $k > m$, then $f(n,m,k) = \binom{n}m$ , since we can't have more consecutive $1$'s than there are $1$'s, so the problem is reduced to counting the number of strings with length $n$ that have $m$ $1$'s. For all other cases we write $f(n,m,k) = 0$ which completes the definition. To Solve (b) I did the following: $$ \begin{align} F_k(x,y) & = \sum_{n,m\ge0}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m \\ & = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\sum_{m=0}^{n}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m \\ & = \sum_{n=0}^{k-1}\sum_{m=0}^{n}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m + \sum_{n=k}^{\infty}\sum_{m=0}^{k-1}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m + \sum_{n=k}^{\infty}\sum_{m=k}^{n}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m \\ & = \sum_{n=0}^{k-1}\sum_{m=0}^{n}\binom{n}m x^n y^m + \sum_{n=k}^{\infty}\sum_{m=0}^{k-1}\binom{n}m x^n y^m + \sum_{n=k}^{\infty}\sum_{m=k}^{n}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m \end{align} $$ By using the convention that $\binom{n}m = 0$ when $m\gt n$, and noting that when $m=n\ge k$ we have $f(n,m,k)=0$ we can write the above equation as follows: $$ \begin{align} & \sum_{m=0}^{k-1}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\binom{n}m x^n y^m + \sum_{n=k+1}^{\infty}\sum_{m=k}^{n-1}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m \\ =& \sum_{m=0}^{k-1} \frac{x^m}{(1-x)^{m+1}} y^m + \sum_{n=k+1}^{\infty}\sum_{m=k}^{n-1}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m \\ =& \frac{1}{1-x} \cdot \omega(x,y) + \sum_{n=k+1}^{\infty}\sum_{m=k}^{n-1}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m  \end{align} $$ where: $$\omega(x,y) := \frac{1 - (\frac{xy}{1-x})^k}{1 - \frac{xy}{1-x}}.$$ Using the recusion formula obtained in (a) we can expand the second summand like so: $$ \begin{align} \sum_{n=k+1}^{\infty}\sum_{m=k}^{n-1}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m & = A + B - C  \end{align} $$ where: $$ \begin{align} A & =\sum_{n=k+1}^{\infty}\sum_{m=k}^{n-1}f(n-1,m,k) x^n y^m \\ & = x\sum_{n=k}^{\infty}\sum_{m=k}^{n}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m \\ & = x\left(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\sum_{m=0}^{n}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m -  \sum_{n=0}^{k-1}\sum_{m=0}^{n}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m - \sum_{n=k}^{\infty}\sum_{m=0}^{k-1}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m \right)\\ & = x\left(F_k(x,y) -  \sum_{n=0}^{k-1}\sum_{m=0}^{n}\binom{n}m x^n y^m - \sum_{n=k}^{\infty}\sum_{m=0}^{k-1}\binom{n}m x^n y^m \right)\\ & = x\left(F_k(x,y) -  \sum_{m=0}^{k-1}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\binom{n}m x^n y^m\right)\\ & = xF_k(x,y) - \frac{x}{1-x} \cdot \omega(x,y)\\ \\ B & =\sum_{n=k+1}^{\infty}\sum_{m=k}^{n-1}f(n-1,m-1,k) x^n y^m \\ & = xy\sum_{n=k}^{\infty}\sum_{m=k-1}^{n-1}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m \\ & = xy\left(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\sum_{m=0}^{n}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m -  \sum_{n=0}^{k-1}\sum_{m=0}^{n}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m - \sum_{n=k}^{\infty}\sum_{m=0}^{k-2}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m \right)\\ & = xy\left(F_k(x,y) -  \sum_{n=0}^{k-1}\sum_{m=0}^{n}\binom{n}m x^n y^m - \sum_{n=k}^{\infty}\sum_{m=0}^{k-2}\binom{n}m x^n y^m \right)\\ & = xy\left(F_k(x,y) -  \sum_{m=0}^{k-2}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\binom{n}m x^n y^m - x^{k-1}y^{k-1}\right)\\ & = xyF_k(x,y) -  xy\sum_{m=0}^{k-2}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\binom{n}m x^n y^m - x^ky^k\\ & = xyF_k(x,y) -  xy\sum_{m=0}^{k-2}\frac{x^m}{(1-x)^{m+1}} y^m - x^ky^k\\ & = xyF_k(x,y) + 1 - \omega(x,y) - x^ky^k\\ \\ C & =\sum_{n=k+1}^{\infty}\sum_{m=k}^{n-1}f(n-k-1,\,m-k,\,k) x^n y^m = x^{k+1}y^kF_k(x,y) \end{align} $$ Summing all the values we get: $$ F_k = \frac{1}{1-x} \cdot \omega + xF_k - \frac{x}{1-x} \cdot \omega + xyF_k + 1 - \omega - x^ky^k - x^{k+1}y^kF_k $$ And so (note that $\omega$ disappears): $$ F_k = \frac{1-x^ky^k}{1-x-xy-x^{k+1}y^k} $$",,"['combinatorics', 'generating-functions']"

Suppose $S_3$ is an ordered $6$ -tuple of $6$ numbers taken modulo $3$ . Let $S_3=(0,1,2,0,1,2).$ Note that if $S_3$ were anything else, then too, we could find $3$ numbers such that they have the same remainder modulo $3.$ Hence, if we prove that this set isn't possible, we will be done with the $n=6$ case.

But, this number cannot be $3$ as there is only way to partition $3$ into $3$ natural numbers: $1+1+1.$ Since this number is a multiple of $3,$ and hence cannot be prime, we are done. So, $n≤5.$ With a bit of casework, it's not too tough to show that $n=5$ isn't possible either. So, $n≤4.$ $k≥4:$ This is where I need your help.

Hence, $n≤k(k-1).$ But, like we saw before, we may be able to do better than $n≤k(k-1).$ Note that I am using the block $(0,1,2,\ldots,k-1)$ to find the upper bound, as if the block were anything else, we would find $k$ numbers with the same remainder modulo $k$ quicker.","Not too long ago, I saw an interesting question on this site that was asking about the maximum value of if there exist numbers such that any of them taken together sum to a prime.

95,On simplicial complexes and their geometric realization,On simplicial complexes and their geometric realization,,"Simplicial complexes can be defined in two different way, i.e. either abstractly as purely combinatorial objects, or embedded in Euclidean space. Let me briefly mention which definitions I use exactly: Definition 1: Let $\mathcal{V}$ be a finite set. An "" abstract simplicial complex "" is a collection of non-empty subsets $\Delta$ of $\mathcal{V}$ such that it contains all the singelton sets and such that for any non-empty $\tau\subset\sigma$ for $\sigma\in\Delta$ it holds that $\tau\in\Delta$ Definition 2: A Euclidean simplicial complex is a collection $\Delta$ of Euclidean simplices (=the convex hull of a bunch of affinely-independent vectors in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ ) such that every face of a simplex is again contained in $\Delta$ , such that the intersection of any two simplices is either empty or the face of both simplices and such that $\Delta$ is locally finite. Obviously, to every Euclidean simplicial complex we can associate an abstract one by defining the abstract simplices to be the sets containing all the vertices of the corresponding Euclidean simplices. The abstract simplicial complex corresponding to a Euclidean one is usually called "" vertex scheme "". Last but not least, we need a notion of equivalence: Let $(\mathcal{V}_{1},\Delta_{1})$ and $(\mathcal{V}_{2},\Delta_{2})$ be two abstract simplicial complexes. A pair of maps $(\varphi:\Delta_{1}\to\Delta_{2},\varphi_{0}:\mathcal{V}_{1}\to\mathcal{V}_{2})$ is called "" simplicial isomorphism "", if it is of the form $\varphi(\{v_{0},\dots,v_{k}\})=\{\varphi_{0}(v_{0}),\dots,\varphi_{0}(v_{k})\}$ and if both $\varphi$ and $\varphi_{0}$ are bijective. In other words, two simplicial isomorphic abstract simplicial complexes admit the same number and the same gluing pattern of simplices. Now, it is a well-known fact that every finite abstract simplicial complex admits a "" geometric realization "", which is a Euclidean simplicial complex whose vertx scheme is simplicial isomorphic to our given complex. This is exactly the point which I do not quite understand. Why does there always exists an isomorphic simplicial complex which has the property that the intersection of two simplices is either a face or empty? It seems that this property in the definition of Euclidean simplicial complexes is much more restrictive, since for an abstract simplicial complex, the intersection of two simplices must not necessarily be again a simplex. For example, consider the following ""triangulation"" of the 2-torus: where we glue together the top and bottom as well as the right and left. Now, this is a well-defined abstract simplicial complex , since the non-empty subset of any simplex is again a simplex. However, it is certainly not an Euclidean simplicial complex, since the intersection of the two triangles is the union of two edges and not again a simplex. So, how does this triangulation, viewed as an abstract simplicial complex, has a geometric realization?

99,Inequality regarding simple graphs with no $4$-cycles,Inequality regarding simple graphs with no -cycles,4,"I've been recently reading on Graph Theory , which is one of those areas I always felt lazy to approach when I trained for mathematical Olympiads.

Extremal graphs without 4-cycles. Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series B, 103(3), 327-336. on bounds regarding graphs without $4$ -cycles — as the title suggests — and had some questions on one of its earlier statements. Lemma 1. Let $q$ be a natural number greater than $2$ and let $G$ be a $C_4$ -free graph on $q^2 + q$ vertices with at least $E_0$ edges. Then the maximum degree of a vertex in $G$ is at most $q + 2$ . Proof . Let $v$ be a vertex of $G$ of maximum degree $d$ , and suppose that $d \geqslant q + 3$ . Let $e$ be the number of edges of $G , e \geqslant \frac12 q(q + 1)^2 − q$ . We proceed by bounding the number of $2$ -paths in $G$ which have no endpoints in $\Gamma (v)$ [where $\Gamma(v)$ represents the set of vertices in the neighborhood of $v$ ]. This gives us: $$\binom{n-d}{2}\geqslant \sum _{v\neq u}\binom{d(v)-1}{2}$$ [where, I believe, $n$ represents the number of vertices in $G$ .] Question 1. What's the meaning of » $2$ -paths«? And, what are the authors counting in the inequality? $\binom{n-d}{2}$ stands for the number of possible connections between two vertices of the set $G\setminus \Gamma (v) $ , right? But, what does $\sum _{v\neq u}\binom{d(v)-1}{2}$ represent? Shouldn't it be $\sum _{u\neq v}\binom{d(u)-1}{2}$ ? From what they derive through Jensen, I would say that they are considering the degrees of elements in $G\setminus \{v\}$ , but still don't understand what they are counting... Later on, in the proof of the Lemma 1, the authors introduce some inequalities which I am struggling to follow, since they are stated without proof: However, we also have: $$\begin{align*}(q + &1)(2e − 2n − d + 2) − (n − 1)(n − d − 1)\\ &\geqslant (q^2 −2)d−q^3 −2q^2 +q+1\\ &\geqslant (q^2 −2)(q+3)−q^3 −3q^2 +1\geqslant q^2 −q−5\end{align*}$$ (...)
