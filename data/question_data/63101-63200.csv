I get the proof that $K_{3,3}$ and $K_5$ are nonplanar, but I am still dumbfounded. I feel like with most things in math, there some be some intuition behind theorems, and concepts.

We can find the number of spanning trees $t(G)$ of $G$ using Kirchhoff's matrix-tree theorem or the deletion-contraction method. I'm interested in the converse of this problem. That is, given $n$, find $G$ such that $t(G)=n$. Without some restrictions on $G$ this problem becomes almost trivial. For example, the cycle $C_n$ has $n$ spanning trees. Additionally, if we identify a vertex of graphs $G$ and $H$, the resulting graph has $t(G) \cdot t(H)$ spanning trees. Likewise if we join $G$ and $H$ with any path. So if we could factor $n$ we would just be dealing with the same question for smaller numbers. Thus I would like to restrict $G$ from being a cycle or a graph with a cut-vertex or cut-edge. My question is then, given $n$, can we always find a graph $G$ which is not a cycle and which has no cut-vertices or cut-edges such that $t(G)=n$? If it is possible to find one, is it possible to find many, or all graphs that satisfy those properties? If it is not possible in general, are we able to determine which $n$ it is true for?

37,What was the gap in Ariane Papke's proof that the minimum number of sudoku clues is 17?,What was the gap in Ariane Papke's proof that the minimum number of sudoku clues is 17?,,"I was reading McGuire's paper on why the minimum number of clues in a Sudoku puzzle is 17 when I came across a curious comment: In 2008, a 17-year-old girl submitted a proof of the nonexistence of a 16-clue sudoku puzzle as an entry to Jugend forscht (the German national science competition for high-school students). She later published her work in the journal Junge Wissenschaft (No. 84, pp. 24–31). However, when Sascha Kurz, a mathematician at the University of Bayreuth, Germany, studied the proof closely, he found a gap that is probably very difficult, if not impossible, to fix. I was able to find the work he was referring to (I think) here . Not knowing German or anyone who speaks German, I had to settle and read a machine translation of the paper, which wasn't very good. By my understanding, the proof went along the lines of this: We start out by expanding the grid into 3D space with a $9$ by $9$ by $9$ cube, and for each square of the puzzle, we place a 1 in the n'th cube from the front and zeros everywhere else behind the square. So for example if we have a 5 in a square of the puzzle, all cubes behind that specific square of the puzzle will contain the number zero except the 5th one, which will contain a 5. We can then create sets of equations with variables which represent the values inside the cubes, and these equations represent the different constraints of Sudoku. Finally, we consider an ""optimal"" configuration of 16 clues which will eliminate as many variables as possible and we find that there are not enough equations to solve for every variable, meaning that a solution to the puzzle wouldn't be unique if it had 16 clues. With all of this being said, I can't seem to find the gap which McGuire mentions. To me, the idea of finding an ""optimal"" configuration does seem a little bit hand wavy, but at the same time the logic does seem sound.

In the case where it can not sum to $Z$ , this subset will have to be removed.

Place the 21 2-digit prime numbers in the white squares of the grid on the right so that each two-digit prime is used exactly once. Two white squares sharing a side must contain two numbers with either the same tens digit or ones digit. A given digit in a white square must equal at least one of the two digits of that square's prime number. They didn't provide a detailed explanation of how they got the (unique) solution on their website, so I was wondering if someone could explain how to come up with the solution? I tried using casework, but there seems to be too many possibilities to consider. Number the white squares from 1 to 21 from left to right and top to bottom and let $c_i$ be the number in square i. Clearly, it seems easier to consider squares containing 2, 4, or 5, but even then I've not sure how to make reasonable deductions. For ease of reference, define the following sets $$\begin{align} P_1 &:= \{13,11,17,19,31,41,61,71\} \\ P_2 &:= \{23,29\} \\ P_3 &:= \{31,37,23,13,43,53,73,83\}\\   P_4 &:= \{41,43,47\} \\  P_5 &:= \{53,59\} \\ P_6 &:= \{61,67\} \\ P_7 &:= \{73,37,79,71,17,47,67,97\} \\ P_8 &:= \{83,89\} \\  P_9 &:= \{19,29,59,79,89,97\} \end{align}$$ Obviously, $c_1,c_3 \in P_3, c_4 \in P_2, c_{12}\in p_5, c_{19},c_{20}\in P_1, c_{18}\in P_4.$ For instance, squares 5 and 8 both contain the digit 9 in the units digit if $c_4=29$ since $c_3 = 23$ , which immediately implies that $c_4\neq 29$ . So $c_4 = 23$ . $c_3$ cannot equal $29.$ So $c_3$ is either $13,43,53,73,73,$ or 83. Suppose $c_8$ ends in a 3. Then $c_3$ and $c_8$ have distinct tens digits and the same units digit. Thus if $c_7$ does not end in a 3, it must share the tens digit of $c_8$ and $c_3$ , a contradiction. Hence $c_7$ ends in a 3. $c_{11}$ cannot share the 3 with $c_7$ and $c_7$ doesn't contain a 9 as its tens digit. If $c_5=53,$ then one of $c_9$ or $c_{16}$ ends in 3.

Show that there will always exist two integers $x,y$ out of those $37$ integers such that $ \mid x-y \mid \in \{9,10,19\}$ . Approach: What have I done so far: Let $S=$ { ${1,2,…,112}$ } We partition the set into subsets $S_i$ of the form $\{x, x+9, x+19\}$ . Then the difference of any two elements is in $\{9, 10, 19 \}$ , which is easy to see.

However, I decide to do a case by case analysis of the situations. Name this set as $X$ . Suppose, initially, that out of the $37$ integers in our selection, none belong to $X$ . Then it follows from Dirichlet's box principle that at least two elements are from the same set (i.e. from one of the subsets that we partitioned $S$ into) then the claim is valid. Now suppose that one element from $X$ is in our selection, say $19$ then if at least one of $9, 28, 29, 38$ is in our selection, then the claim is valid. Suppose none of these are present, and we are deficit in four integers. We  can now select any four integers from the remaining numbers and the box principle guarantees that at least two are from the same set. For, even if all $3$ other elements of $X$ are now present, there is one empty slot which can be filled using the other subsets from where we already have at least one element in our choice of $37$ numbers.

The students know that the number of monotonic paths from $(0,0)$ to $(n,n)$ that do not cross above (but may touch ) the diagonal is given by the Catalan number $C_n$. The most obvious solution is the following: Introducing an auxiliary subdiagonal $1$ unit length below turns the question into ""how many monotonic paths are there from $(1,0)$ to $(12,11)$ that are allowed to touch the diagonal and go through $(3,0)$?"" From $(1,0)$ we can only reach $(2,0)$, from where we can reach $(3,0)$ or $(2,1)$.

There was no explanation given by the student, but I figured that this expression was most probably derived from André's reflection method , i.e. the number of monotonic paths is $\binom{9+11}{11}$, and if we substitute all $\to$ moves for $\uparrow$ moves and vice versa from the point a path goes bad, we end up at $(11,12)$ instead, which gives us a bijection from the bad paths to all monotonic paths from $(3,0)$ to $(11,12)$, of which there are $\binom{8+12}{12}$.

72,Bell numbers and the Moments of expected number of fixed points,Bell numbers and the Moments of expected number of fixed points,,"Let $X_N$ be the random variable corresponding to the number of fixed points (1-cycles) in a permutation chosen uniformly at random from $S_N$ . Then, the $m^{\text{th}}$ moment, when $m < N$ , is equal to $B_m$ where $B_k$ is the $k^{\text{th}}$ Bell number (equal to the number of partitions of the set $[k]$ ). This is a really interesting combinatorial fact, not least because all the moments are integers (moments past the $N^{\text{th}}$ are as well) and deserves a combinatorial solution. Now, I have two proofs that are fairly combinatorial - however, both involve sums and avoid the combinatorial meaning of $X_{N}^m$ , whatever that may be. I reproduce the first below: Let $X_N$ be the number of fixed points in a random permutation on $N$ elements. It is well known that $E[X_N]=1$ . For $0\leq M \leq N$ , $E\left[{X_N \choose M}\right]$ counts the expected number of sets of $M$ fixed points. We can count this using indicator random variables. Consider all subsets of $[N]$ containing $M$ elements. The probability that a subset of size $M$ is pointwise fixed by a random permutation $\pi$ is $\frac{(N-M)!}{N!}$ because there are $(N-M)!$ permutations on the remaining elements that keep the subset of $M$ elemnts fixed (the number of automorphisms on $[N]-[M]$ ). This factor can also come from realizing that a permutation on $[N]$ induces an injection from a subset of $M$ elements to $[N]$ of which only $1$ sends each element to itself. Because the injections are uniformly chosen, we have a factor of $\frac{1}{N^{\underline{M}}} = \frac{(N-M)!}{N!}$ . Hence the expected value is ${N \choose M} \times \frac{(N-M)!}{N!} = \frac{1}{M!}$ . Hence the expected value of $E[(X_N)^{\underline{M}}]$ is $1$ . Hence the expected value of $E[(X_N)^M]$ is $B_M$ , the $M^{th}$ Bell Number for $0 \leq M \leq N$ . However, this involves at the end an ugly summation and (in my mind) fails to capture why the expectation ought to be an integer outside of coincidence.

Then, the moment, when , is equal to where is the Bell number (equal to the number of partitions of the set ). This is a really interesting combinatorial fact, not least because all the moments are integers (moments past the are as well) and deserves a combinatorial solution. Now, I have two proofs that are fairly combinatorial - however, both involve sums and avoid the combinatorial meaning of , whatever that may be. I reproduce the first below: Let be the number of fixed points in a random permutation on elements. It is well known that . For , counts the expected number of sets of fixed points. We can count this using indicator random variables. Consider all subsets of containing elements. The probability that a subset of size is pointwise fixed by a random permutation is because there are permutations on the remaining elements that keep the subset of elemnts fixed (the number of automorphisms on ). This factor can also come from realizing that a permutation on induces an injection from a subset of elements to of which only sends each element to itself. Because the injections are uniformly chosen, we have a factor of . Hence the expected value is . Hence the expected value of is . Hence the expected value of is , the Bell Number for . However, this involves at the end an ugly summation and (in my mind) fails to capture why the expectation ought to be an integer outside of coincidence.

94,How many Latin Squares are there with the following restrictions?,How many Latin Squares are there with the following restrictions?,,"This problem comes from a study of game design, specifically the wonderful abstract strategy game Kamisado, which I highly recommend for the mathematically minded. The rules of the game are not so important, I am interested only in the board, which looks like this - The board is an 8x8 Latin Square. I wonder how much choice the designer had in choosing the board. The only restrictions we want are that the board should be the same for both players, and that swapping two colours doesn't matter in terms of gameplay. So the question is, more generally, ""How many Latin squares of size $n$ exist which are isomorphic under a rotation of 180 degrees and symbol permutation?"" Specifically, for $n=8$, ""How many possible Kamisado boards are there?"". I know the answer must be in the literature somewhere, but am unfamiliar with the area and terminology.
