15,Direct (Inductive) limit of (locally convex) TVEs and universal property,Direct (Inductive) limit of (locally convex) TVEs and universal property,,"This is not really a question, I'd just like to discuss a little about universal properties (more specifically, the direct limit) in TVEs. I'm trying to work with universal properties in Topological Vector Spaces (TVEs) (over $\mathbb{K}\in\left\{\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}\right\}$), constructing the universal objects, etc... If we were to define an inductive limit of TVEs, according to the categorical definition, it'ld be the following: Fix a directed set $(I,\leq)$, that is, an ordered set $(I,\leq)$ such that for every $i,j\in I$ there exists $k\in I$ such that $i\leq k$ and $j\leq k$ (although it's common to drop antissimmetry). Definition : Let $(I,\leq)$ be a directed set and $\left\{V_i:i\in I\right\}$ be a family of TVEs and $\left\{T_{ji}:i\leq j\in I\right\}$ be a family of functions $T_{ji}\in\mathscr{L}(V_i,V_j)$, that is, continuous linear functions from $V_i$ to $V_j$ satisfying: $T_{ii}=id_{V_i}$ $T_{ki}=T_{kj}T_{ji}$, for all $i\leq j\leq k$. A direct limit of those two families is a TVE $\mathbb{V}$ together with a family $\left\{\phi_i\in\mathscr{L}(V_i,\mathbb{V}):i\in I\right\}$ satisfying   $\phi_i=\phi_jT_{ji}$ for $i\leq j$ and such that for every other TVE $\mathbb{W}$ with a family of morphisms $\left\{\psi_i\in\mathscr{L}(V_i,\mathbb{W}):i\in I\right\}$ satisfying $\psi_i=\psi_jT_{ji}$ for $j\leq i$, there exists an unique function $\Phi\in\mathscr{L}(\mathbb{V},\mathbb{W})$ satisfying $\psi_i=\Phi\phi_i$. The same definition works for locally convex TVEs. Although, most books define the direct limit of locally convex spaces in the following way: Definition ( H. H. Schaefer, Topological Vector Spaces ): Let $\left\{V_\lambda:\lambda\in\Lambda\right\}$ be a family of locally convex spaces (where $\Lambda$ is only an index set), $\mathbb{V}$ a vector space and $\left\{T_\lambda\in L(V_\lambda,\mathbb{V}):\lambda\in\Lambda\right\}$. The direct limit topology on $\mathbb{V}$ is the finest locally convex topology for which each $T_\lambda$ is continuous. It's not obvious to me that those two definition are equivalent. I think that the first definition is more ellegant than the second. Is there a good reason why we should use the second one? One thing that is funny is that the direct sum of locally convex TVEs is defined as the algebraic direct sum (the subspace of $\prod_{\lambda\in\Lambda}V_\lambda$ of elements $(v_\lambda)$ for which $v_\lambda=0$ except for a finite number of indexes) with the direct limit topology, and it satisfies the universal property of the direct sum. When working in categories, this is usually done the other way: the direct limit is a quotient of the direct sum (if that makes sense, of course).","This is not really a question, I'd just like to discuss a little about universal properties (more specifically, the direct limit) in TVEs. I'm trying to work with universal properties in Topological Vector Spaces (TVEs) (over $\mathbb{K}\in\left\{\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}\right\}$), constructing the universal objects, etc... If we were to define an inductive limit of TVEs, according to the categorical definition, it'ld be the following: Fix a directed set $(I,\leq)$, that is, an ordered set $(I,\leq)$ such that for every $i,j\in I$ there exists $k\in I$ such that $i\leq k$ and $j\leq k$ (although it's common to drop antissimmetry). Definition : Let $(I,\leq)$ be a directed set and $\left\{V_i:i\in I\right\}$ be a family of TVEs and $\left\{T_{ji}:i\leq j\in I\right\}$ be a family of functions $T_{ji}\in\mathscr{L}(V_i,V_j)$, that is, continuous linear functions from $V_i$ to $V_j$ satisfying: $T_{ii}=id_{V_i}$ $T_{ki}=T_{kj}T_{ji}$, for all $i\leq j\leq k$. A direct limit of those two families is a TVE $\mathbb{V}$ together with a family $\left\{\phi_i\in\mathscr{L}(V_i,\mathbb{V}):i\in I\right\}$ satisfying   $\phi_i=\phi_jT_{ji}$ for $i\leq j$ and such that for every other TVE $\mathbb{W}$ with a family of morphisms $\left\{\psi_i\in\mathscr{L}(V_i,\mathbb{W}):i\in I\right\}$ satisfying $\psi_i=\psi_jT_{ji}$ for $j\leq i$, there exists an unique function $\Phi\in\mathscr{L}(\mathbb{V},\mathbb{W})$ satisfying $\psi_i=\Phi\phi_i$. The same definition works for locally convex TVEs. Although, most books define the direct limit of locally convex spaces in the following way: Definition ( H. H. Schaefer, Topological Vector Spaces ): Let $\left\{V_\lambda:\lambda\in\Lambda\right\}$ be a family of locally convex spaces (where $\Lambda$ is only an index set), $\mathbb{V}$ a vector space and $\left\{T_\lambda\in L(V_\lambda,\mathbb{V}):\lambda\in\Lambda\right\}$. The direct limit topology on $\mathbb{V}$ is the finest locally convex topology for which each $T_\lambda$ is continuous. It's not obvious to me that those two definition are equivalent. I think that the first definition is more ellegant than the second. Is there a good reason why we should use the second one? One thing that is funny is that the direct sum of locally convex TVEs is defined as the algebraic direct sum (the subspace of $\prod_{\lambda\in\Lambda}V_\lambda$ of elements $(v_\lambda)$ for which $v_\lambda=0$ except for a finite number of indexes) with the direct limit topology, and it satisfies the universal property of the direct sum.

Let $J \in \mathbb Z$ and $M \in \mathbb Z^n$ . Then $$ 2^{J(\frac{n}{p}+r)} \int_{Q_{J,M}} |f^\lambda(x)|^p \, dx \leqslant \sum_{l \colon J_l \geqslant J} 2^{-(J_l-J)(\frac{n}{p}+r)p} + \sum_{l \colon J_l < J} 2^{(J-J_l)rp} < \infty $$ where we used $\frac{n}{p}+r > 0$ and $r > 0$ . Hence $f^\lambda \in L^r_p(\mathbb R^n)$ . If $\lambda^1$ and $\lambda^2$ are two different admitted sequences then one has $\lambda^1_{J_l,M^l} = 1$ and $\lambda_{J_l,M^l} = -1$ for some $l \in \mathbb N$ and $$ \| f^{\lambda^1} - f^{\lambda^2} \|_{L^r_p(\mathbb R^n)} \geqslant 2^{J_l(\frac{n}{p}+r)} \left( \int_{Q_{J_l,M^l}} |(f^{\lambda^1} - f^{\lambda^2})(x)|^p \, dx \right)^{1/p} = 2. $$ But the set of all these admitted functions $f^\lambda$ is non-countable, having the cardinality of $\mathbb R$ .

As I see it, we have that $U$ is $\mathcal{T}$ -closed, convex and balanced. So, the bipolar theorem applied with respect to the dual pair $\langle E, F \rangle$ tells us that $$U^{\circ\circ} = \overline{\text{conv}\left( U \cup \{0_E\} \right)}^{w(E,F)}$$ As $U$ is convex and balanced we can simplify it to $$U^{\circ\circ} = \overline{U}^{w(E,F)}$$ Now, I don't see how to get $U$ from here, because we know that $U$ is $\mathcal{T}$ -closed, but that doesn't implie that it is $w(E,F)$ -closed. What am I missing?

Bratteli and D. W. Robinson, and Example 2.1.9 says the following: Let $\mathfrak{A}=C_0(X)$ , the commutative $C^*$ -algebra(...). If $F$ is a closed subset of $X$ , and $\mathfrak{B}$ consists of the elements in $\mathfrak{A}$ which are zero on $F$ then $\mathfrak{B}$ is a closed two-sided ideal of $\mathfrak{A}$ (...). Using the Stone-Weierstrass theorem one can show that each closed, two-sided ideal in $\mathfrak{A}$ has this form. Here $X$ is a locally compact Hausdorff space. I found a proof which shows this fact for compact $X$ using Stone-Weierstrass theorem ( Ideal in $C(X)$ ), and I tried to show the statement above based on this argument. Unfortunately, in the link we need to use that $X/F$ is compact when $X$ is compact and $F$ is closed, which is not true for locally compact space: i.e. $X/F$ could be not locally compact when $X$ is locally compact and $F$ is closed(see Quotient of a locally compact space ). This makes us hard to use the Stone-Weierstrass theoem, since we do not know the ${}^*$ -subalgebra of $C_0(X/F)$ which separates points and vanishes nowhere is dense(see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone%E2%80%93Weierstrass_theorem for definitions).
