0,A stimulating book about algebra,A stimulating book about algebra,,"I need to fill some gaps in my algebra knowledge. The problem is: While I do realise the importance and utility of the subject, I do not find it appealing.   Is there any book around which shows you why the subject is beautiful and stimulate curiosity? To list some books which I think do that in other fields: Gravitation by Misner, Thorne and Wheeler (not just for the GR part but also for the differential geometry bit), the shape of space by Week for topology, probably visual complex analysis by Needham, differential topology by Guillemin and Pollack. For some more details: I am trying to learn the amount of algebra usually known by a math graduate student who is not planning to work in abstract algebra. I have been trained as a theoretical physicist so I received fully rigorous courses in linear algebra and finite group theory (taught by mathematicians) but pretty much nothing else (of course I have had a nodding acquaintance with several other concepts). The need for some more serious grounding in algebra first arose when I was trying to apply some algebraic topology tools. Therefore I am thinking of learning first about modules and rings (leaving aside a more serious study of fields for the moment), then learn a bit of the categorical viewpoint and see the various structures in action by learning a bit of homological/commutative algebra. I was thinking to get the basic on Lang undergraduate algebra, and then move on to the first few chapters of Hilton-Stammbach possibly complemented by Lang grad book and Atiyah-MacDonald. I will be happy to hear feedback on my study plan as well, but the main point here is if you can find me a book which will make algebra fascinating!","I need to fill some gaps in my algebra knowledge.

As $a_1$ is not irreducible, $a_1=bc$, with both $b$ and $c$ non-units. Both $b$ and $c$ cannot have factorization into irreducibles since in that case we would have a factorization into irreducibles of $a_1$.

What I have done so far is : consider $\eta :\mathcal{C}[0,1]\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ where $f\rightarrow f(0)$ $Ker (\eta) = \{ f\in \mathcal{C}[0,1] : f(0)=0\}$ I could see that for each $r\in \mathbb{R}$, I would set $f$ such that $f(x)=x+r$ So, $\eta$ is surjective. So, I would get $\mathcal{C}[0,1]/\mathcal{I}\cong \mathbb{R}$ As $\mathbb{R}$ is a field so ia the quotient $\mathcal{C}[0,1]/\mathcal{I}$ which means that $\mathcal{I}$ is an ideal in $\mathcal{C}[0,1]$. Now Another Question on same idea : Question is to see if : the ideal $\mathcal{I}=\{f\in \mathcal{C}[0,1] : f(0)=f(1)=0\}$ is maximal ideal in the ring $\mathcal{C}[0,1]$ of all continuous real valued functions. I thought of using same ideas as above but i am unable to choose perfect $\eta$ I believe that this is not even a prime ideal.. I set  $f(x)=x$ and $g(x)=x-1$ and consider $f(x)g(x)=(x)(x-1)$ then, $(fg)(0)=f(0)g(0)=0.(-1)=0$ $(fg)(1)=f(1)g(1)=1.0=0$ So, $fg\in \mathcal{I}=\{f\in \mathcal{C}[0,1] : f(0)=f(1)=0\}$ but the neither $f$ nor $g$ is in $\mathcal{I}$. I have two questions: I see that $0$ does not play any role in the question $\mathcal{I}=\{f\in \mathcal{C}[0,1] : f(0)=0\}$ I mean I would have same case if i replace $0$ by any real number. So, I would like to say that $$\mathcal{I}=\{f\in \mathcal{C}[0,1] : f(r)=0\}$$  is a maximal ideal in the ring $\mathcal{C}[0,1]$ of all continuous real valued functions. And one more thing I would claim is that If the collection $\mathcal{I}$ is such that all elements of $\mathcal{I}$ has more than $1$ common zero then $\mathcal{I}$ is not a maximal ideal and not even a prime ideal.. I would like to learn more about this kind of ideals in $\mathcal{C}[0,1]$. I would be thankful if some one can assure that what  have done is sufficient to conlcude what i have concluded and I would be thankful if some one can suggest some material to read regarding this.

The matrix is rather large, so I was trying a 3x3 sub matrix first to just make sure I could get something simpler into SNF before embarking on the 7x7 case.

Unfortunately when I went about this the matrix I ended up with was indeed diagonal but I did not get the dividing condition. So my question is if there is a specific sequence of operations which will get me to SNF (i.e. not every reduction will result in SNF) or if I somehow made a mistake.

97,$f = X^{3} + 2$ irreducible in $\mathbb{F}_{49}[X]$.,irreducible in .,f = X^{3} + 2 \mathbb{F}_{49}[X],"Question : Prove that $f = X^{3} + 2$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{F}_{49}[X]$ . Is $f$ irreducible in $\mathbb{F}_{7^{n}}$ for all even $n$ ? My attempt : Notice that $\deg(f) = 3$ , therefore $f$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{F}_{49}[X]$ if and only if $f$ has no roots. We will first look at $f$ in $\mathbb{F}_{7}[X]$ , since if $f$ would have roots in $\mathbb{F}_{7}$ then it would also have roots in $\mathbb{F}_{49}$ because it is a subfield. With checking we find that $f$ has no roots in $\mathbb{F}_{7}$ . Now let $\alpha \in \overline{\mathbb{F}_{7}}$ be a root of $f$ . Then, it follows that $\mathbb{F}_{7}(\alpha)$ is a finite field extension of $\mathbb{F}_{7}$ of degree 3. Then it follows that $\# \mathbb{F}_{7}(\alpha) = 7^{3}$ and by uniqueness of this field we have $\mathbb{F}_{7}(\alpha) \cong \mathbb{F}_{7^{3}}$ . Now, we clearly see that a field containing a root of $f$ must contain $\mathbb{F}_{7^3}$ , it follows directly that this root is not contained in $\mathbb{F}_{49}$ , and therefore $f$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{F}_{49}[X]$ . The polynomial $f$ is not irreducible over $\mathbb{F}_{7^{n}}$ for all even $n$ . Consider for example $n = 6$ , then since $3$ is a divisor of $6$ we have that $\mathbb{F}_{7^{3}} \subset \mathbb{F}_{7^{6}}$ is a subfield, and therefore the root of $f$ is contained in $\mathbb{F}_{7^{6}}$ . My concern : My main concern with my proof is if my approach of assuming that $\mathbb{F}_{7}(\alpha) \cong \mathbb{F}_{7^{3}}$ is correct, and whether I can directly say that such a root of $f$ can never be in $\mathbb{F}_{49}$ .

I can prove there is this exact sequence. I am thoroughly unconvinced that it should split in general; at least, I'm unconvinced that the same arguments he uses (somewhat carelessly?) in the special case of $D$ being concentrated in degree zero will work in general. About "" $R$ is nice"", for the case where $D$ is just one module it suffices to consider $R$ a hereditary ring; then the sequence will split. What's my gripe? Well, the standard arguments conclude that $Z_\bullet$ and $B_\bullet$ (cycles and boundaries of $C$ ) are projective and flat and we say $0\to Z_n\to C_n\to B_{n-1}\to0$ splits, with some splitting $r:C_n\twoheadrightarrow Z_n$ . We run some argument and deduce the sequence exists, where the first map has an easy description. However, to create a projection map $H_n(C\otimes_R D)\to\bigoplus_{p+q=n}H_p(C)\otimes_R H_q(D)$ is hard, since the cycle subgroup of $C\otimes_R D$ is mysterious. Moreover , it should not be true that $Z_p\otimes D_q$ is a subgroup of the $n$ -cycles of $C\otimes_R D$ ; we can only expect this to be true if, say, the differentials of $D$ are trivial (as they are in the $D$ -is-a-single-module special case). But the only thing I can know how to do is consider the map $r\otimes1:C_p\otimes_R D_q\twoheadrightarrow Z_p\otimes_R D_q$ and there is absolutely no reason for this map to induce a map on homology. There is also no reason to expect we can magically extend this by some $Z_p\otimes_R D_q\overset{??}{\twoheadrightarrow}H_p(C)\otimes_R H_q(D)$ . I think that there is perhaps an error and we should assume something of $D$ too, if we expect this to split - such as assuming $D_q$ is free for every $q$ , because then there is a splitting $D_q\to Z(D)_q$ and we can make everything work using a generalised version of the case $D$ is just one module, in particular using the fact $Z(C)_p\otimes_R Z(D)_q$ is a subgroup of $Z(C\otimes_R D)_n$ .
