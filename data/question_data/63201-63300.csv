Every $3$ -element subset of $S$ has $2$ elements one of which divides the other. Suppose $S$ does not have $3$ different numbers that divide each other consecutively. Then consider the first three elements of $S$ . We may find $a_1,a_2$ among them with $a_1 | a_2$ . Then by assumption $a_2$ cannot divide any other element of $S$ . Assume first that $a_1 = b_1$ . If $a_2 = b_2$ , then considering $\{b_2,b_3,b_4\}$ , we see that $b_3 | b_4.$ Considering $\{b_2,b_3,b_5\},$ we see that $b_3 | b_5.$ Considering $\{b_2,b_4,b_5\},$ we see $b_4 | b_5.$ But this gives a contradiction since we can choose $\{b_3,b_4,b_5\}$ as the 3-element subset. Now assume $a_2 = b_3$ . Considering $\{b_3,b_4,b_5\},b_4 | b_5.$ Considering $\{b_2,b_3,b_4\},$ we see that $b_2 | b_3$ . Considering $\{b_1,b_2,b_4\},$ we see that there is no possibility left (that won't lead to a contradiction). Finally, assume $a_1 = b_2,a_2=b_3.$ Considering $\{b_3,b_4,b_5\}, b_4 | b_5.$ Considering $\{b_1,b_2,b_4\}$ , we see that there is no possibility left. Hence the claim must hold for $n=2$ . Here's the technical solution I found online. We can define a poset on $S$ by $x\leq y$ iff $x|y$ . The condition that there does not exist an $n+1$ element subset such that no element divides another translates into the condition that there is no antichain of length $n+1$ in $S$ . An antichain is any sequence of pairwise distinct elements of $S$ none of which are comparable according to the ordering on the poset on $S$ . Hence the longest antichain in $S$ is of length at most n, so by Dilworth's theorem, $S$ can be written as the union of at most n chains. Since $S$ has $n^2+1$ elements, this implies one of these chains has a length of at least $n+1$ . Version of Dilworth's Theorem used: Let $P$ be a finite poset.

Say we get the arrangement $$\color{red}{AB}\color{blue}{BCD}\color{red}{BCD} \ \ \ (*)$$ In total, we have $$6 \cdot C(5,2) \cdot 3! = 360$$ arrangements, however we have overcounted. The problem is that we could have obtained the arrangement in $(*)$ another way; initially placing $BCD$ at the end, and then filling in the rest of the letters. Thus, arrangements with two occurrences of $BCD$ get double counted. Conversely, if $BCD$ only occurs once, that arrangement does not get double counted, so we need to subtract the number of arrangements with $BCD$ occuring twice from $360$ . There are $C(4,2) \cdot 2$ arrangements with two occurences of $BCD$ , so the final answer is $$360 - C(4,2) \cdot 2 = 348.$$ My question: Is my approach okay?

Right now I am reading Book of Proof, by Richard Hammack, and in the Chapter on Counting, I came across the following exercise: Use combinatorial proof to show that $\sum\limits_{k=m}^{n}\binom{k}{m}=\binom{n+1}{m+1}$ . My proof was the following: Suppose $m\leq n$ and let $S=\{0,1,2,\ldots,m,\dots,n\}$ . Notice that $|S| = n+1$ and that the right hand side of the equation, by definition, is the number of subsets of order $m+1$ of $S$ . Now, we will count the numbers of subsets of order $m+1$ of $S$ in a different way: for every element $k$ of $S$ such that $m\leq k\leq n$ we count the number of subsets of order $m$ of $S$ such that, for every subset we construct, all elements are less than $k$ . By construction, there are always $k$ numbers less than $k$ in $S$ , therefore, there are $\binom{k}{m}$ such subsets. For each of these subsets, it's union with $\{k\}$ is a different subset of order $m+1$ of $S$ . Since $k$ could be any number in $[m,n]$ , we have that $\sum\limits_{k=m}^{n}\binom{k}{m}$ counts all subsets of $S$ with order $m+1$ . Since the right-hand and left-hand sides are solutions to the same counting problem, we conclude they are equal. $\blacksquare$ I desperately need some feedback on my proof-writing skills.

21,Why does the MOG provide the octads of a Steiner system,Why does the MOG provide the octads of a Steiner system,,"I have been reading about the Mathieu finite simple groups, which has taken me on an interesting detour through coding theory, and the Miracle Octad Generator (MOG). There are a lot of instructions online on how the MOG works, but much less on why it works, and it's the why I'd like some pointers on. In terms of the how , I understand that you've got 24 points laid out onto a grid, and obeying some rules, you can extend any 5 of them to an octad of the steiner system S(5,8,24). The rules are based around parity of the rows and columns, and scoring the columns to give hexacode words , which are all words from a 6-dimensional codebook over the finite field $F_4$ . Although a tad fiddly, this is all well and good. In order to try and find out why it works, I have read the reference everyone gives: chapter 11 of Conway/Sloane's Sphere Packing, Lattices and Groups.

There are a lot of instructions online on how the MOG works, but much less on why it works, and it's the why I'd like some pointers on. In terms of the how , I understand that you've got 24 points laid out onto a grid, and obeying some rules, you can extend any 5 of them to an octad of the steiner system S(5,8,24). The rules are based around parity of the rows and columns, and scoring the columns to give hexacode words , which are all words from a 6-dimensional codebook over the finite field . Although a tad fiddly, this is all well and good. In order to try and find out why it works, I have read the reference everyone gives: chapter 11 of Conway/Sloane's Sphere Packing, Lattices and Groups.

Every sensor is connected to one row-wire and one column-wire. Multiple sensors can use the same row-wire or the same column-wire, but each sensor needs a unique row-wire/column-wire pair. We have a set of sensors $S = \{S_1, S_2, \dots,S_N\}$ and a connector $C$ , which all lie in a metric space with distance function $d$ . We could also say that $S \cup \{C\}$ is the set of vertices of a positively weighted complete graph. (2D Euclidean space may be assumed if that makes it easier) We need to find two partitions of $S$ : a row partition $S_r$ and a column partition $S_c$ , under the condition $$\forall\ x \in S_r,\ y \in S_c:\ |x \cap y| \le 1.$$ The goal is to find partitions that minimize the total wiring length $$ T=\sum_{x \in S_r} W(x \cup \{C\}) + \sum_{y \in S_c} W(y \cup \{C\}). $$ Here $W(z)$ is a function that gives the total weight of the minimum spanning tree that connects all elements of $z$ . What is a fast algorithm to find optimal or reasonable $S_r$ and $S_c$ to minimize $T$ ? Note: It is possible to use even less wiring if we allow a wire to split in different directions at a point that is not a sensor or connector, but to keep it simple let's not use that possibility. Example In the image, the black circles are the sensors, the red circle is the connector, the blue lines are the row wires and the green lines are the column wires. Here we have $S_r = \{\{S_1,S_2,S_4\},\{S_3,S_5,S_6\}\}$ and $S_c = \{\{S_1,S_3\},\{S_2\},\{S_4,S_5\},\{S_6\}\}$ . The wiring here is arbitrarily chosen by me, I don't know if it's optimal. Idea We don't have to consider combinations that have a minimum spanning tree with $C$ as an internal vertex. For example, in the example above we don't have to consider any partitions that contain $\{S_2, S_6\}$ , because $C$ is in the middle of $S_2$ and $S_6$ , and we might just as well take $\{S_2\}$ and $\{S_6\}$ separately.

Every two teams play with each other once (so there is $n(n-1)/2$ games at all). The scores are: Win: 2, Draw: 1, Lose: 0. At the last ranking table, team in the $i$ -th place has $S_i$ points. ( $S_1 \geq S_2 \geq S_3 \geq ... \geq S_n$ ) we want to prove that $S_{i-1} - S_{i} \leq n ;~~~ 2\leq i\leq n$ . For the proof, I wanted to use induction. If we think $n-1$ is satisfied, then if we add the $n$ -th team, in the worst situation if it wins all the games and all the teams in previous games have $n-2$ points (all equal), then we get $S_{new} - S_{first~Place~Before~Adding~New} = 2(n-1) - (n-2) = n$ . But the problem is I cannot prove that it is actually the worst situation. for example I cannot say if $S_{i} - S_{i-1} = n-1$ before adding the $n$ -th team, what will happen if I add $n$ -th team? P.S : Another approach is proof by contradiction. Let $S_i - S_{i-1} \geq n+1$ . Suppose this happens for the first and second place. first place has $a$ points and all others have at most $a-n-1$ then if we solve $(n-1)(a-n-1) + a \geq n(n-1)/2 \times2$ (Sum of the scores at the and is number of games *2). then we get $a\geq 2n -1/n -1$ . It is completely impossible for all other teams to have more than $2n-1/n-1 - n -1$ points. The problem is that I supposed that the $n+1$ point difference occurs between first and second place.

I'm going to consider the set of $p$-cycles on $\mathbb{S}(\mathbb{Z}_p)$, which I'll denote $C_p$. Now, $C_p$ has size $(p-1)!$ for the following reason: it suffices to choose the images of $1,,...,p$ without repeating values or having fixed points, therefore we have $p-1$ options for the image of $1$, $p-2$ for the image of $2$, and so on until we get to the image of $p$, which is at this point already determined. Now, let's observe that if $a \in \mathbb{Z}_p^{\times}$, the translation given by summing $a$, $$ \tau_a : \mathbb{Z}_p \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_p \\ x \ \mapsto a + x  $$ is an element of $C_p$ with inverse $\tau_{-a}$.

61,Forming seven letter words by using the letters of the word $\text{SUCCESS}$,Forming seven letter words by using the letters of the word,\text{SUCCESS},"If you have patience please read through the whole post. I have made clear what was my line of thought for each step that I did. Problem Statement:- How many words of seven letters formed by the letters of the word $\text{SUCCESS}$ so that $\text{(i)}$ the two $\text{C's}$ are together but not the two $\text{S's}$. $\text{(ii)}$ neither the two $\text{C's}$ nor the two $\text{S's}$ are together. My Attempt at a solution:- $\text{(i) Part - 1}$ $\text{1}^\text{st}$ Approach:- Since we have to arrange the letters in such a way that the $\text{C's}$ occur together but the $\text{S's}$ don't, so we first combine the two $\text{C's}$ together into one entity, reducing the total letters(or entities) to $6$. Since the $\text{S's}$ shouldn't occur consecutively(that's what I infer from the ""the two \text{S's} should not be together"" part in the question"") we first arrange the remaining letters(or entities) which are  $\{\text{U,CC,E}\}$. $$\_\;\text{U}\;\_\;\text{CC}\;\_\;\text{E}\;\_$$ After arranging these letters we see that there are $4$ gaps in which the $3 \text{ S's}$ can be arranged so that none of the $\text{S's}$ are together, also the letters that were arranged before the $\text{S's}$ can be arranged among themselves in $3!$ ways. So, the total number of ways in which we can arrange the given letters so that the two $\text{C's}$ occur together but no two $\text{S's}$ occur together$=\displaystyle\binom{4}{3}\cdot3!=24$ But the textbook gives the answer as $12$. Now, just to check whether my first attempt for the $\text{1}^\text{st}$ part of the question was correct or not I decided to approach it differently. $\text{2}^\text{nd}$ Approach:- Number of ways in which the two $\text{C's}$ occur together$=\dfrac{6!}{3!}$ Since no two $\text{S's}$ must occur together, hence The number of ways in which no two $\text{C's}$ and no two $\text{S's}$ occur together$=\text{Total number of permutations $-$ Number of ways in which two $\text{C's}$ and two $\text{S's}$ occur together}$ Now, lets find the number of ways in which two $\text{S's}$ and two $\text{C's}$ occur together. The number of ways will be that in which we group two $\text{C's}$ and two $\text{S's}$ into, say, one super $\Bbb{C}$ and one super $\Bbb{S}$. So, we have to arrange $\{\text{S,U,$\Bbb{C}$,E,$\Bbb{S}$}\}$, which can be done in $5!$ ways. After starting out on working on this approach I found that there is a little confusion that I have that whether three $\text{S's}$ could occur together or not. If they can, then we have to exclude the permutation in which three $\text{S's}$ and two $\text{C's}$ occur together simultaneously from the permutation of two $\text{C's}$ and two $\text{S's}$ (so that they maybe counted in the total count) which is given by $4!$. So, the number of ways in which no two $\text{C's}$ and no two $\text{S's}$ occur together becomes $$\dfrac{6!}{3!}-(5!-4!)=24$$. But, if the three $\text{S's}$ cannot occur together then, we have the permutation of the letters under the assumed condition as $$\dfrac{6!}{3!}-5!=0$$ This approach turned out to be more confusing considering how I got $0$ ways when the three $\text{S's}$ cannot occur together which I think is not correct, because a simple counter example is $\text{SUSCCES}$. $\text{(ii) Part - 2}$ $\text{1}^\text{st}$ Approach:- In this Approach I used the number of ways in which the two $\text{C's}$ occur together but not the two $\text{S's}$, so this can also act as the verification for the answer of the $1^\text{st}$ part. First, we will find the number of ways in which the two $\text{S's}$ don't occur together, which can be found by the gap method as follows $$\_\;\text{U}\;\_\;\text{C}\;\_\;\text{C}\;\_\;\text{E}\;\_$$ Since we have $5$ gaps, so the $3\text{ S's}$ can be placed in $\binom{5}{3}$ ways followed by the arrangement of the prearranged letters in $\dfrac{4!}{2!}$. So, we get the number of ways in which the two $\text{S's}$ don't occur together as $$\binom{5}{3}\cdot\dfrac{4!}{2!}=120$$ Now, from this we exclude the number of ways in which the two $\text{C's}$ occur together with the two $\text{S's}$ not occurring together simultaneously, which is given by:- if we consider the first approach of the first part of the question, and the first assumption of the second approach, as correct then$=\displaystyle\binom{4}{3}\cdot3!=24$ If we consider the second assumption of the second approach of the first part as correct, then $0$ (well lets leave this one, we already know there is some blunder in there that I have done) So, the total number of ways in which neither the two $\text{C's}$ nor the two $\text{S's}$ are together=$$\binom{5}{3}\cdot\dfrac{4!}{2!} - \displaystyle\binom{4}{3}\cdot3!=120-24=\boxed{96}$$ Viola, the answer of the second part is correct, so the book gives the wrong answer for the first part. Now, considering the book gave the wrong answer and the first assumption of the second approach in the first part was correct(yeah, this looks like a maze to me now to indicate all this XD), I thought of applying some PIE for my second method. $\text{2}^\text{nd}$ Approach:- Since this approach is inspired by the first assumption in 2nd approach for the first part, so I assumed that what the problem implies by the statement ""the two $\text{S's}$ are together"" is that only two of the $\text{S's}$ should occur together at a time. So, consider the following sets $$A\rightarrow \text{All the permutations that include two C's together}\\ B\rightarrow \text{All the permutations that  include only two S's together}$$ So, $$|A|=\dfrac{6!}{3!}=120\\ |B|=\dfrac{6!}{2!}(\rightarrow\text{two S's occur together})-\dfrac{5!}{2!}(\rightarrow\text{three S's occur together})=300\\ |A\cap B|=5!(\rightarrow\text{two C's and two S's occur together simultaneously})-4!(\rightarrow\text{two C's and three S's ocurr together simultaneously})=96$$ Now, as per PIE, we have  $$|A\cup B|=|A|+|B|-|A\cap B|=120+300-96=420-96$$ Now, $\left(A\cup B\right)^c=\left(A^c\cap B^c\right)$, and $\left(A^c\cap B^c\right)\implies \text{two C's don't occur together and two S's don't occur together}$ $$\|(A\cup B)^c|=|(A^c\cap B^c)|=\dfrac{7!}{3!\times2!}-|A\cup B|=420-(420-96)=\boxed{96}$$ Conclusion: What bugs me. What's wrong with the second assumption of the second approach in the answer to the first part of the question that I am getting $0$ as the answer given that I have already shown a counter example that tells that there are infact more than $0$ ways. I find the language of the question quite confusing. The ""the two $\text{S's}$"" part confuses me the most. How does it mean that only two of the $\text{S's}$ should occur together and not three of them. In my opinion, the mention of the THE in "" THE two $\text{S's}$"" tells that only those two $\text{S's}$ should come together that were initially together in the word $\text{SUCCESS}$ were the $\text{S's}$ considered to be different, but as the S's are indistinguishable so that makes the statement ""only two of the three $\text{S's}$ should occur together"". Lastly, I found the same question as the second part of the question and one of the solutions though looked very lucrative, I can't seem to understand how it was formulated, if you think that it can be understood by a student having knowledge of highschool mathematics and what I consider to be a little knowledge of engineering mathematics then, can you enlighten me as to how it was formulated.","If you have patience please read through the whole post.

69,How to find the largest possible value when moving values between N nodes,How to find the largest possible value when moving values between N nodes,,"I stumbled upon an interesting combinatorial question while playing Magic: the Gathering. Take N nodes on a complete graph, each node with an assigned value. Each node's value begins at 1, and may increase as the game progresses. Each move of the game consists of a node adding its value to the value of one other node that it's connected to. (The source node does not reduce its value after this operation; values can never decrease.) After one move in each direction along a graph edge (two moves in total), that edge is deleted and no more moves can be made along that edge.  The goal is to end up with the greatest possible total value among all nodes after all moves have been made. The total number of moves in the game will be (N choose 2) * 2. (The number of edges times 2, since each edge allows one move in each direction.) For example, consider N=2. The starting configuration is A=1, B=1. To begin the game, Node A adds its value to node B, resulting in A=1, B=2. Then node B adds its value to node A, resulting in A=3, B=2. The game is now over, and the final score is 5. The only other possibility is to have node B move first, which simply results in A=2, B=3 and the same final score. However the problem becomes greatly more complex when more nodes are added. The complexity of the game increases extremely quickly, making brute-force approaches infeasible. So far, the maxima I have achieved for various N through experimentation are: N=1: 1 N=2: 5 N=3: 29 N=4: 249 N=5: 3866 But I am by no means convinced these are the best answers (at least for N>2). There are a number of simple instruction sets that can do well, such as ""always move away from the node with the highest value to the node with the highest value among its legal choices"".

Can we make  small?","18 a,b,c,d a+b=c+d 18","I've known that the following proposition is true for $n=20$. Proposition : For any $n$ distinct two-digit numbers, there exists a set of four distinct numbers $a,b,c,d$ such that $a+b=c+d$. Then, I began to try to find the minimum of $n$ such that the proposition is true. Then, I've got that the proposition is true for $\color{red}{n=19}$. Proof that the proposition is true for $n=19$ : Let the given $19$ numbers be $a_1\lt a_2\lt \cdots\lt a_{19}$. Also, let $\{a_2-a_1,a_3-a_2,\cdots, a_{19}-a_{18}\}=\{b_1,b_2,\cdots, b_{18}\}$ where $b_1\le b_2\le\cdots\le b_{18}$. Suppose that there exists no set of four distinct numbers $a,b,c,d$ such that $a-c=d-b$. If $b_n=b_{n+1}$, then there exist $p,q\ (p\lt q)$ such that $a_{p+1}-a_p=a_{q+1}-a_q$, but from the supposition, $q=p+1$ has to hold. It follows from this that there are no three same numbers in $b_n$ and that  $\sum_{k=1}^{18}b_k\ge 1+1+2+2+\cdots +9+9=90$, which contradicts that we have $\sum_{k=1}^{18}b_k=a_{19}-a_1\le 99-10=89$. QED This is all I've been able to get so far. So, my question is the following : Question : How can we find the minimum of $n$ such that the proposition is true? Added : Byron Schmuland proves that the proposition is true for $n=14$ under the condition that $a,b,c,d$ are not necessarily distinct. Also, he comments that we can prove that the proposition is true for $n=15$ under the condition that $a,b,c,d$ are distinct according to the solution for a related question . What I mean in this question is that $a,b,c,d$ are distinct . (sorry, this might not be obvious. So, I add the word ""distinct"") We now know that the minimum of $n$ has to be less than or equal to $15$. Here, I'm going to write the proof for $n=15$ by getting the key idea from the above solution. Proof that the proposition is true for $n=15$ where $a,b,c,d$ are distinct : Suppose that there exists no set of four numbers $a,b,c,d$ such that $a-c=d-b$. There are $\binom{15}{2}=105$ ways to choose $2$ numbers from the given $15$ numbers. From the supposition, each difference of their $2$ numbers are distinct except the case when $$i-j=j-k\tag1$$ where $i\gt j\gt k$. Here, for every $j$, there exists at most one $(i,k)$ satisfying $(1)$. This is because if there were distinct $(i,k),(i',k')$ such that $i-j=j-k,i'-j=j-k'$, then the four numbers $i,k,i',k'$ would be distinct and would satisfy $i-i'=k'-k$, which contradicts the supposition. Since $j$ can neither the maximum number nor the minimum number, the number of the patterns where $(1)$ happens is at most $15-2=13$. Hence, if we eliminate at most $13$ sets of $2$ numbers, then each difference of the $2$ numbers from the remaining $105-13=92$ is distinct. However, the difference of $2$ numbers is either $1,2,\cdots, 88,89(=99-10)$, which is a contradiction. QED Added : Byron Schmuland and Ross Millikan independently show eleven 2-digit numbers so that every pair has a different sum. So, we now know that the minimum $n_{\text{min}}$ of $n$ has to satisfy $\color{red}{12\le n_{\text{min}}\le 15}$.","I've known that the following proposition is true for $n=20$. Proposition : For any $n$ distinct two-digit numbers, there exists a set of four distinct numbers $a,b,c,d$ such that $a+b=c+d$. Then, I began to try to find the minimum of $n$ such that the proposition is true. Then, I've got that the proposition is true for $\color{red}{n=19}$. Proof that the proposition is true for $n=19$ : Let the given $19$ numbers be $a_1\lt a_2\lt \cdots\lt a_{19}$. Also, let $\{a_2-a_1,a_3-a_2,\cdots, a_{19}-a_{18}\}=\{b_1,b_2,\cdots, b_{18}\}$ where $b_1\le b_2\le\cdots\le b_{18}$. Suppose that there exists no set of four distinct numbers $a,b,c,d$ such that $a-c=d-b$. If $b_n=b_{n+1}$, then there exist $p,q\ (p\lt q)$ such that $a_{p+1}-a_p=a_{q+1}-a_q$, but from the supposition, $q=p+1$ has to hold. It follows from this that there are no three same numbers in $b_n$ and that  $\sum_{k=1}^{18}b_k\ge 1+1+2+2+\cdots +9+9=90$, which contradicts that we have $\sum_{k=1}^{18}b_k=a_{19}-a_1\le 99-10=89$. QED This is all I've been able to get so far. So, my question is the following : Question : How can we find the minimum of $n$ such that the proposition is true? Added : Byron Schmuland proves that the proposition is true for $n=14$ under the condition that $a,b,c,d$ are not necessarily distinct. Also, he comments that we can prove that the proposition is true for $n=15$ under the condition that $a,b,c,d$ are distinct according to the solution for a related question . What I mean in this question is that $a,b,c,d$ are distinct . (sorry, this might not be obvious. So, I add the word ""distinct"") We now know that the minimum of $n$ has to be less than or equal to $15$. Here, I'm going to write the proof for $n=15$ by getting the key idea from the above solution. Proof that the proposition is true for $n=15$ where $a,b,c,d$ are distinct : Suppose that there exists no set of four numbers $a,b,c,d$ such that $a-c=d-b$. There are $\binom{15}{2}=105$ ways to choose $2$ numbers from the given $15$ numbers. From the supposition, each difference of their $2$ numbers are distinct except the case when $$i-j=j-k\tag1$$ where $i\gt j\gt k$. Here, for every $j$, there exists at most one $(i,k)$ satisfying $(1)$. This is because if there were distinct $(i,k),(i',k')$ such that $i-j=j-k,i'-j=j-k'$, then the four numbers $i,k,i',k'$ would be distinct and would satisfy $i-i'=k'-k$, which contradicts the supposition. Since $j$ can neither the maximum number nor the minimum number, the number of the patterns where $(1)$ happens is at most $15-2=13$. Hence, if we eliminate at most $13$ sets of $2$ numbers, then each difference of the $2$ numbers from the remaining $105-13=92$ is distinct.

82,Permutations to satisfy a challenging restriction,Permutations to satisfy a challenging restriction,,"In a stack of n distinct cards in order {1,2,3,4,...,n} from top, define distance between 2   cards as the number of cards between them.   2 cards are neighbours if they're adjacent in original stack, if their index differs by 1. How many card rearrangements (permutations) satisfy the following? I) The sum of distances between any card and its    neighbour/s (call that sum $S_n$ for card $n$), is distinct for all $n$   cards. II) $S_n$ is distinct for all $n$ and only take on values smaller than $n$. Edit 1 : an example makes the conditions clearer. Say we have 3 cards in original stack in order 1,2,3 from top. Rearrange cards into order 2,3,1 from top. Then: Card 1 is distance 1 from its former neighbour card 2. $S_1$=1 Card 2 is distance 1 to card 1 but distance 0 to card 3. $S_2$=1+0=1 Card 3 is distance 0 from card 2. $S_3$=0 Hence this reordering/shuffle does not satisfy the conditions in the question, as both $S_1$ and $S_2$ are 1. Edit 2 : JLee and LaBird kindly wrote programs to generate data(thanks so much!). Using the data I did a quick plot to guess possible relationships between n and the ratio of permutations satisfying condition 1 in respect to the total number of permutations of length n. This is a less than scientific approach, but in the spirit of contribution, i hope this can 'trigger' ways to solve the problem. Brief comment: It appears that the slope of the log plot is stabilising to around -1/2, though this is a pure guess without more data. My attempt: I made a list of basic observations, trying to link this problem to known methods, but to little success. i)  Let original order of cards be 1,2,3,4…..,n for simplicity from top of stack . After the order of the cards are randomized, the distance between cards 2 and 3 will contribute to both S2 and S3, as they were neighbours before. ii) The question is analogous to a frog making n-1 leaps on a 1*n board, labelled 1,2,3,4…..n from left to right.

Can this problem be solved for small n like n=5? thanks as always","In a stack of n distinct cards in order {1,2,3,4,...,n} from top, define distance between 2   cards as the number of cards between them.   2 cards are neighbours if they're adjacent in original stack, if their index differs by 1. How many card rearrangements (permutations) satisfy the following? I) The sum of distances between any card and its    neighbour/s (call that sum $S_n$ for card $n$), is distinct for all $n$   cards. II) $S_n$ is distinct for all $n$ and only take on values smaller than $n$. Edit 1 : an example makes the conditions clearer. Say we have 3 cards in original stack in order 1,2,3 from top. Rearrange cards into order 2,3,1 from top. Then: Card 1 is distance 1 from its former neighbour card 2. $S_1$=1 Card 2 is distance 1 to card 1 but distance 0 to card 3. $S_2$=1+0=1 Card 3 is distance 0 from card 2. $S_3$=0 Hence this reordering/shuffle does not satisfy the conditions in the question, as both $S_1$ and $S_2$ are 1. Edit 2 : JLee and LaBird kindly wrote programs to generate data(thanks so much!). Using the data I did a quick plot to guess possible relationships between n and the ratio of permutations satisfying condition 1 in respect to the total number of permutations of length n. This is a less than scientific approach, but in the spirit of contribution, i hope this can 'trigger' ways to solve the problem. Brief comment: It appears that the slope of the log plot is stabilising to around -1/2, though this is a pure guess without more data. My attempt: I made a list of basic observations, trying to link this problem to known methods, but to little success. i)  Let original order of cards be 1,2,3,4…..,n for simplicity from top of stack . After the order of the cards are randomized, the distance between cards 2 and 3 will contribute to both S2 and S3, as they were neighbours before. ii) The question is analogous to a frog making n-1 leaps on a 1*n board, labelled 1,2,3,4…..n from left to right. Starting on the square representing the new position of card 1, the frog makes leaps so that on the mth turn, the it is on the square representing the new position of the mth card. The restrictions are that every square must be covered exactly once and the magnitude of the first and last leaps, and the sum of the magnitudes of any 2 consecutive leaps must be distinct. iii)    Cards 1 and n have only 1 neighbour, so after rearranging, S1 and Sn are the distances between card 1 and its former neighbour and card n and its former neighbour, respectively. iv) In part i) Sn can take on any value from 0 to 2n-5.

92,"Who conjectured that there are only finitely many biplanes, and why?","Who conjectured that there are only finitely many biplanes, and why?",,"This question on MathOverflow motivates me to ask what the reasoning is behind the conjecture that there are only finitely many biplanes.  More generally, it has been conjectured that for fixed $\lambda>1$ there are only finitely many triples $(v,k,\lambda)$ such that a symmetric balanced incomplete block design with these parameters exists. My understanding is that prior to the proof that there is no projective plane of order 10, there was some hope that the Bruck-Ryser-Chowla condition would prove to be sufficient for the existence of a design.  Yet by that time the finitely-many-biplanes conjecture was already in wide circulation.  Since there are infinitely many triples $(v,k,2)$ that satisfy the Bruck-Ryser-Chowla condition, it appears that the design-theory community was able to entertain two conjectures that are not merely incompatible, but starkly opposed. Is anyone aware of any of the history behind this? Elaboration (added later): If we think about families of symmetric designs, with $v$ regarded as a parameter and $\lambda$ some function of $v$ (which would make $k$ a function of $v$ as well), then we can talk about ""large-$\lambda$"" designs, where $\lim_{v\to\infty}\frac{\lambda}{v}=\frac{1}{4}$, and ""small-$\lambda$"" designs, where $\lim_{v\to\infty}\frac{\lambda}{v}=0$.

More generally, it has been conjectured that for fixed $\lambda>1$ there are only finitely many triples $(v,k,\lambda)$ such that a symmetric balanced incomplete block design with these parameters exists. My understanding is that prior to the proof that there is no projective plane of order 10, there was some hope that the Bruck-Ryser-Chowla condition would prove to be sufficient for the existence of a design.  Yet by that time the finitely-many-biplanes conjecture was already in wide circulation.

In Mathematica I did try to ""optimize"" it as much as I could using its built-in functions but too slow. For MATLAB, I couldn't see how to vectorize it so just had to write a loop which is of course a bad idea. Any efficient algorithms? Any ideas?

If we considered the smooth continuation of $f(x)$ over $\mathbb{R^+}$ then yes the intermediate value theorem guarantees us the fixed point ($f(x)-x$ has an $x$-intercept because it switches sign). But how do we know, how can we prove that the fixed point is EXACTLY on an integer? I mean I know the answer must exist because the question was posed but frankly I am a little surprised that there is another integer after one where the integer exactly equals the number of times ""1"" is needed to get there. 6.Can we say anything about the long term behavior of $f$?
