Thus, we have  $$B_1 = B \subset A_1 = A$$ and  $$A_2 = f(A_1) = f(A) \subset B = B_1,$$ that is,  $$A_2 \subset B_1 \subset A_1.$$ Now if, for any +ive integer $n \geq 1$, we have  $$B_{n+1} \subset B_n \subset A_n, $$ then we also have $$B_{n+2} = f(B_{n+1}) \subset f(B_n) = B_{n+1}$$ and  $$B_{n+1} = f(B_n) \subset f(A_n) = A_{n+1},  $$ that is,  $$B_{n+2} \subset B_{n+1} \subset A_{n+1}.$$ Hence using induction we can conclude that $$A_{n+1} \subset B_n \subset A_n \ \mbox{ for each } \ n \in \mathbb{N}.$$ That is,  $$A_1 \supset B_1 \supset A_2 \supset B_2 \supset A_3 \supset B_3 \supset \ldots.$$ Now let the map $h \colon A \to B$ be defined as follows: $$ h(x) \colon=  \begin{cases}  f(x) \ & \mbox{ if } \ x \in A_n - B_n \ \mbox{ for some } \ n; \\ x \ & \mbox{ otherwise}.  \end{cases} $$ Munkres claims that this map $h$ is a bijection.

Obviously, because it's a race, each one of the $n$ competitors wants to win. Hence, the order of the arrangements does matter. Let us also say that if two competitors end with the same result of time, they win the same spot. For example, $E(3)$ contains the following sets of arrangements: ${(1,1,1), (1,1,2), (1,2,1), (1,2,2), (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,1,1), (2,1,2),(2,1,3), (2,2,1), (2,3,1), (3,1,2), (3,2,1)}.$ Needless to say, for example, that the arrangement $(1,3,3)$ is invalid, because the two competitors that supposedly ended in the third place, actually ended in the second place. So the above arrangement ""transfers"" to $(1,2,2)$. Define $k$ to be the number of distinct positions of the competitors in a subset of $E(n)$.  We have for example: $(1,1,1)\Rightarrow k = 1$ $(1,2,1)\Rightarrow k = 2$ $(1,2,3,2)\Rightarrow k = 3$ $(1,2,1,5,4,4,3)\Rightarrow k = 5$ Finally , let $M(n,k)$ be the number of subsets of $E(n)$ in which the competitors ended in exactly $k$ distinct positions.

After some time of thought I came up with the following recursive formula for $|E(n)|$: (Don't continue reading if you want to derive a formula yourself!) $$|E(n)| = \sum_{l=1}^n\binom{n}{l}\cdot |E(n-l)| \quad\text{where}\quad |E(0)| = 1$$ The logic behind this recurrence relation is that $l$ symbolizes how many ""first"" spots we have. For each $l$, the binomial coefficient $\binom{n}{l}$ symbolizes in how many ways we can pick $l$ first-placers out of the $n$ competitors. Once we have chosen them, we to need to figure out in how many ways we can arrange the $n-l$ competitors we have left, which is just $|E(n-l)|$.

And $|E(1000)|$ mod $1$ $000$ $000$ $007 = 581423957$ $\rightarrow$ 39 sec.

But I'm not 100% sure about this because I was not able to compute this approach for large $n$. However, even with precalculating factorials and memoizing the $E(n)$'s, the calculating times for higher $n$'s grow very fast. Is anyone capable of verifying the above formula and values? Can anyone derive a better, faster formula? Perhaps with generating functions? As for $M(n,k)$.. I'm totally clueless. I absolutely have no idea how to calculate it, and therefore I couldn't post any meaningful data points.  Perhaps it's $P(n,k) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$. Can anyone figure out a formula for $M(n,k)$? I have no idea which function is harder to compute, either $E(n)$ or $M(n,k)$, but helping me with either of them will be very much appreciable.

James' book General Topology and Homotopy Theory : Suppose we have a cotriad $$X \xleftarrow{\xi}W \xrightarrow{\eta}  Y.$$ ... we might expect the pushout of the cotriad to be a quotient set of $X \sqcup Y$ . So consider the triad $$X \xrightarrow{\sigma} X  \sqcup Y \xleftarrow{\tau} Y.$$ The obvious relation $\sim$ on $X  \sqcup Y$ to try is the one where $\sigma x \sim \tau y$ if there exists a point $z \in W$ such that $\xi z = x$ and $\eta z = y$ . Unfortunately, this is not, in general, an equivalence relation... in general, it is necessary to form the transitive closure in order to obtain a quotient of $X \sqcup Y$ which satisfies the conditions for a push-out. The procedure of forming the transitive closure can, however, be omitted if one of the insertions [EA: i.e. either $\xi$ or $\eta$ ] is injective.

I will list a few of the different places I have gotten if somebody wants to go from there, but besides distributing the P, I don't know what to do. $x \in \{y |(P\lor Q) \land (P\lor \neg R\}$ $x \in \{y| ((P\land P)\lor (P \land \neg R)) \lor ((Q \land P) \lor (Q \land \neg R))$ $x \in \{y|((P \lor P) \land (P \lor Q)) \lor ((P \lor Q) \land \neg R)\}$ Obviously, my goal would be to get to $x \in \{ y|(P \lor  Q) \land \neg(R \land \neg P)\}$, I could finish from there, but not from where I am.

How would you express the set of all points that belong to at least $m$ sets in the sequence $(A_{n})$? I tried toying around with combinations of $\bigcup$'s and $\bigcap$'s, but to no avail. (I was thinking about the meaning of $\limsup A_{n}$ and $\liminf A_{n}$ and trying to modify it.) Any hints, help would be great!",,"['real-analysis', 'elementary-set-theory']"
98,Intersection of subset of a natural number a member of the subset?,Intersection of subset of a natural number a member of the subset?,,"I am working with the set theoretic natural numbers and trying to do an exercise from Halmos's Naive Set Theory. The exercise is to show that if $E$ is a nonempty subset of a natural number, then there is $k\in E$ such that for every $m\neq k$ in $E$, we have $k\in m$. I am trying to show that $\bigcap E$ is the $k$ we seek. I have already shown that $\bigcap E$ has the ""minimality"" property, and am now just trying to prove that $\bigcap E \in E$, but am stuck.

99,All Sets have bijection with cartesian products of Subsets?,All Sets have bijection with cartesian products of Subsets?,,"I was doodling around with some math today, trying to find ""representations"" for sets as cartesian products of their proper subsets. For example: $\mathbb{N}\leftrightarrow 2\mathbb{N}\times\{0,1\}$ $\mathbb{Z}\leftrightarrow 2\mathbb{Z}\times\{0,1\}$ $\mathbb{R}\leftrightarrow \mathbb{Z}\times[0,1)$ I'm thinking most ways to do this have to do with abstract algebra, using quotient structures times the respective substructure. But I was wondering given an arbitrary non-empty set $A$ and ignoring trivial cases like $|A|=1$, does there always exist a bijection with some $B\times C$ where $B$ and $C$ are proper non-empty subsets of $A$?","I was doodling around with some math today, trying to find ""representations"" for sets as cartesian products of their proper subsets.
