1,Calculating the size of a password search space,Calculating the size of a password search space,,"I'm writing something where a character needs to crack a file. Brute force is the only option, and restricting the search space is the only way not to spend eternity on it. The problem Our hero does not know $l$ , the length of the password, but he estimates that it's at least 12 characters long. The alphabet of the search space is uppercase English letters (26), lowercase English letters (26), digits (10), and special characters (33), for a total size of 95 characters. Our hero assumes the password isn't stupid, so he rules out all passwords that do not : contain at least an uppercase character contain at least a lowercase character contain at least a digit contain at least a special character Also, our hero can reasonably guess $k<l$ different characters of the passwords. He knows they are letters, but they can be either upper- or lowercase, and he does not know where they are in the password. The reasons don't matter here, but I need to show the password in the novel; this means that I'd rather be careful with its length, the number of known characters, and to an extent, the speed of the computer used to decrypt the file. This is sci-fi we're talking about, so I do have quite some wiggle room in terms of computing speed (whatever it is, it's gonna be faster than any real supercomputer), but if I'm not careful I might still pick a password that would require a ridiculously fast computer to crack in the short time I need (days); that's why I need to calculate the size of the search space I outlined above, so I can tweak $k$ (known characters) and $l$ (password length) to establish a reasonable computing speed even for fiction. Here's my math. I don't trust myself very much on it so I'd like a sanity check. As said, our hero will check all passwords of length 12 and above. For a generic password of length $l$ with an alphabet of size 95, the search space $N$ should be $$N = 95^l,$$ because each and every of the $l$ characters can take any of the 95 possible values. However, since our hero is checking all passwords of length 12 and above, the search space gets larger: $$N = \sum_{n = 12}^{l} 95^n$$ However, our hero knows that $k$ characters of the password are for sure six different English letters, either uppercase or lower case, though he doesn't know where they are in the password. This means that, of the $l$ characters of the password, only $l-k$ can take any of the 95 values of the alphabet; the remaining $k$ characters can take only fewer. The first of these $k$ characters can have any of 12 values (6 letters $\times$ 2 formats, upper or lowercase); the second can have only 10 (one letter in both its variants has already been chosen), the third only 8, and so on. This parameter depends on $k$ , and we call it $\gamma_k$ : $$\gamma_k = \prod_{n = 0}^{k-1} (l-2n)$$ So, for a password of fixed-length $l$ with $k$ known characters, you'd expect the search space to be $$N_k =  \gamma_k\sum_{n = 12 - k}^{l-k} 95^n,$$ but that doesn't take into account the fact that the $k$ known characters could be placed anywhere in the password. The first one could be placed in $l$ different ways; the second in $l-1$ , and so on, meaning that the actual search space should be $$N_k =  \gamma_k\sum_{n = 12 - k}^{l-k}\frac{(n+k)!}{n!} 95^n.$$ This space is HUGE, but our hero can still reduce it down to $N_k^R < N_k$ thanks to the rules outlined above. To compute $N_k^R$ , I reasoned as follows. The way $N_k$ has been built, at least 6 characters are letters; this means that it's not accounting for any passwords made only of digits, of symbols, or a combination of the two; this kind of password is excluded from the search as per our rules, but we don't need to worry about them because $N_k$ already excludes them. However, we do need to rule out passwords that are purely alphabetical, or alphanumeric without special characters, or ""alphaspecial"" without digits. We also need to rule out passwords where  letters are all lowercase or all uppercase. The number of purely alphabetic passwords given that we known $k$ characters should be $$A_k =  \gamma_k\sum_{n = 12 - k}^{l-k}\frac{(n+k)!}{n!} 54^n,$$ where 54 is 26 + 26, that is an alphabet of only uppercase and lowercase letters. $A_k$ is also accounting for any purely alphabetic passwords that are all uppercase or all lowercase. but not for passwords that include upper- or lowercase letters AND digits or special characters. To account for the latter, we can compute the number of passwords such that: If they contain letters, they're all uppercase Can contain digits or special characters. This number should be $$U_k^M = k!\sum_{n = 12 - k}^{l-k}\frac{(n+k)!}{n!} 69^n,$$ where $k!$ replaces $\gamma_k$ because the $k$ known letters can only be uppercase, and hence the first can be chosen in $k$ different ways, the second in $k-1$ , etc; the remaining letters can't be uppercase, and hence the alphabet they're drawn from consists of only 69 characters rather than 95. The size of the set of passwords such that they can contain digits or special characters, and if they contain letters these are all lowercase, is identical, but we denote it as $L_k^M$ for clarity. Now, we can shrink $N_k$ by subtracting these numbers from it, but there's a small issue: among the passwords that $U_k^M$ and $L_k^M$ are counting, there also are passwords that are purely alphabetical, which are already accounted for by $A_k$ , so we need to add them back lest subtracting them twice. These passwords are $$U_k = L_k = k!\sum_{n = 12 - k}^{l-k}\frac{(n+k)!}{n!} 26^n,$$ that is, purely alphabetical passwords where all characters are either uppercase ( $U_k$ ) or lowercase ( $L_k$ ). Ultimately, I think the reduced space should be $$N_k^R = N_k - L_k^M - U_k^M - A_k + L_k + U_k.$$ Questions Do you agree this is how you compute what I need? Am I leaving anything out\doing anything wrong? I implemented this thing in JavaScript to figure out the best values for $k$ and $l$ (as well as the speed of the decrypting computer). Somehow , it turns out that the larger k is, the longer it takes to decrypt the file , i.e. the more characters you know, the more difficult it is to find the right password, which sounds absurd. This might be because: My implementation is wrong somewhere. My math is wrong somewhere. Knowing what characters are in the password without knowing where they are is effectively worse than not knowing them, because even though $k$ characters have fewer possible values, you need to try them in every possible place and this might end up requiring more attempts than just traditional brute-force. What I'd need from you guys is help determining whether this a math issue or not--if it's not, it's a code problem and I will deal with that on a different SE.","I'm writing something where a character needs to crack a file.

I want to create a collection of all possible quadratic equations in the form of $ax^2+bx+c=0$ where $|ac|=|\alpha\beta|=N=6$ , and $\alpha+\beta=b$ . Note that all constants are integers but $x$ is not necessarily integer. Here is my attempt. How many ways to specify $a$ and $c$ The prime factors of $N$ is $$ P=\{2,3\} $$ The all possible pairs of $(a,c)$ are $$ \{(1,\pm 6), (6,\pm 1), (2,\pm 3), (3,\pm 2)\} $$ Here I don't need to consider the case in which $a<0$ because, for example, $6x^2+5x-1=0$ is actually identical to $-6x^2-5x+1=0$ . Only the sign of $b$ and $c$ do matter here. From $2^2=4$ subsets of $P$ , we can create $\frac{2^2}{2}=2$ ""partitions"", each ""partition"" can be assigned to $(a,c)$ in $2!=2$ ways, and $c$ can have two choice of signs. Thus there are $$ \frac{2^2}{2}\times 2! \times 2 = 8 $$ ways to create $(a,c)$ . How many ways to specify $b$ The all possible pairs of $(\alpha,\beta)$ are $$ \{(\pm 1,\pm 6), (\pm 2,\pm 3)\} $$ Therefore  the all possible values of $b$ are $$ \{\pm |1+6|, \pm |1-6| = \pm |2+3|, \pm |2-3|\} = \{\pm 7, \pm 5, \pm 1 \} $$ I cannot find an easier way to calculate how many possible ways to determine $b$ because the same $b$ can be obtained from two (or possibly more) ""partitions"". For example, partition $\{1,6\}$ and $\{2,3\}$ can produce $b=\pm 5$ as follows. $$ \pm |1-6| = \pm |2+3| $$ As we can see, there are $3\times 2=6$ ways to assign $b$ .

In all honesty, I only know how to do well probably Case 1 and 2 and even then I'm not sure. Case 1: {1, 1, 1, 1, 1} - 5! Case 2: {2, 1, 1, 1} - (5C2 * 3C1) * 3! Case 1 is pretty straight forward. For case 2, I have used 5C2 to take two positions. Because those position will be occupied by identical letters, the order does not really matter. But I had to multiply by 3C1 because there are three possible letters. Yeah the tricky part is that you don't consider just letters with two repetitions but those with at least 2, so S is included.

Question: Assume $3\le k\ll p$ . For two distinct numbers $a,b$ in $\mathbb{Z}_p$ , let $$\mathcal{S}(a,b):=\{S\subseteq \mathbb{Z}_p: |S|=k-1, S\cup\{a\}\text { and }S\cup\{b\}\text{ are both $k$-APs}\}.$$ Can you give an upper bound $f(k)$ on $\max_{a,b\in\mathbb{Z}_P:a\neq b}|\mathcal{S}(a,b)|$ , where $f(k)$ is a function only depending on $k$ (but not $p$ )? Example: Given $a=1,b=4$ in $\mathbb{Z}_p$ for $p$ large enough and $k=3$ , then $S=\{3,5\}$ is one of what we should count, as $\{1,3,5\}$ and $\{3,4,5\}$ are both $3$ -term arithmetic progressions in $\mathbb{Z}_p$ . $\{2,3\}$ is another one we should count. So if some upper bound $f(k)$ exists, it should be at least 2. Idea: Someone claims $k^6$ is an upper bound. And their reason is that assume $x_1,x_2\in S$ and the positions of $x_1,x_2$ in the arithmetic progressions containing $a$ are $i_1,i_2$ , respectively, and are $j_1,j_2$ for the other arithmetic progression containing $b$ .

28,Longest consecutive runs of sums of $k$-subsets of first $n$ primes,Longest consecutive runs of sums of -subsets of first  primes,k n,"Table of contents [ $1.$ ] Definition [ $2.$ ] Implication. (Motivation.) [ $3.$ ] Question. & Computed data. [ $4.$ ] Solutions of simplified variations. [ $5.$ ] Progress on solving the question. [ $6.$ ] Characterization of critical region? [ $1.$ ]  Definition. $T(k, n)$ = length of the longest consecutive run of sums of $k$ -subsets of first $n$ primes. Where $n\ge 0$ and $k=0,\dots,n$ and specially $T(0, n)=T(n, n)=1$ . Notice that this triangle is symmetric: $T(k,n)=T(n-k,n)$ . Example: If $n=4$ , we have first four primes: {2,3,5,7} . Then for example, all possible $k=2$ subsets are: {2,3},{2,5},{2,7},{3,5},{3,7},{5,7} , and their sums are, when sorted: "" 5,7,8,9,10,12 "". The longest consecutive streak there is "" 7,8,9,10 "", of length four $\implies T(2,4)=4$ . [ $2.$ ] Implication. (Motivation.) $T(k,n)$ is the length of longest consecutive run of sums of $k$ -subsets of first $n$ primes. Let $t_{k,n}$ be the smallest (first) sum of this longest consecutive run. It holds: If $N$ is the number such that all prime gaps below it are $\le T(k,n)$ , then all numbers in the interval $[t_{k,n}+p_{n+1},N]$ are ""trivially"" a sum of exactly $k+1$ distinct primes, where $p_{n+1}$ is the $(n+1)$ th prime. Example: If $(k=9,n=12)$ , we get $T(9, 12)=42$ and $t_{k,n}=138$ , where $p_{13}=41$ . All prime gaps below $N=15683$ are $36\lt42$ . This means all numbers $\in[179,15683]$ can be ""trivially"" represented as sums of exactly $10$ distinct primes. Alternatively, we just simply observed that $9$ -combinations of first $12$ primes are sufficient to cover all prime gaps in the range $[179,15683]$ , and thus reach any number in that range when combined with some prime $p_{(i\gt 12)}$ , since the set of those combinations contains $42$ consecutive values, which is more than enough, since largest prime gap in that range is $36\lt 42$ . This example was used in an answer to the linked question . You may notice that this is a generalization of the linked answer, which was an inspiration for defining $T(k,n)$ . We could now continue for example, to observe same $k$ but different $n$ , to cover more ranges of numbers that can be ""trivially"" represented as a sum of exactly $k+1$ distinct primes. [ $3.$ ] Question. & Computed data. Is a ""closed form"" for calculating (determining) the values of $T(k, n)$ possible? Due to symmetry $T(k, n)=T(n-k, n)$ , we can assume that $k\le \lfloor n/2 \rfloor +1$ . We already specially defined $k=0$ . Moving on, it is not hard to see: $T(1,n)=1;n=1$ , and $T(1,n)=2,n\ge2$ . $T(2,n)=1,2,4,4;n=2,3,4,5$ , and $T(2,n)=5,n\ge 6$ . But for $k= 3$ already, a closed form does not appear to be easy: $$T(3,n)=1,2,4,6,10,18,22,22,40,42,46,60,66,70,70,70,100,100,106,120,132,\dots$$ Computed data for $n=0,\dots,100$ (rows) and all $k=0,\dots,n$ (columns) is listed here . - Thanks to vujazzman's suggestion of using dynamic programming, instead of re-calculating every step over and over, where I was initially wasting time. Note that, if a ""closed form"" is possible, it must depend on prime gaps in some way. [ $4.$ ] Solutions of simplified variations. Lets generalize the definition, to use some set $\mathbb A$ , instead of the set of primes $\mathbb P$ . That is, define $T(k,n;\mathbb A)$ where $\mathbb A$ is some countable set of natural numbers, as the longest consecutive run of sums of $k$ -subsets of first $n$ elements of the given set. Then, for example, if we use natural numbers, we have a simple closed form: $$T(k, n; \mathbb N)=k(n-k)+1$$ Another example, let $D=\{2,3,5,7,9,\dots\}$ be the set of odd numbers $\gt 1$ and $2$ . Then: $$ T(k, n; D)= 2[k(n-k)-n+2]$$ For $k,n\gt 0$ . Otherwise, for either $n=0$ or $k=0$ , we define it as $1$ . We can now keep removing numbers from the last example. That is, define $\mathbb P|_{r}$ as the set of first $r$ primes, and all numbers not divisible by them. Then, $ D = \mathbb P|_{1}$ , and $\mathbb P|_{\infty}=\mathbb P$ . I've looked into finding closed forms of some $\mathbb P|_{r},r\in \mathbb N$ , and observed that there are patterns related to finite subsets of prime gaps. (Based on computed terms.) This motivated be to write $T(k, n)$ triangle as a $m\times m$ table, then transform it by subtracting consecutive terms horizontally and vertically. This is discussed in the next section. [ $5.$ ] Progress on solving the question. We define a $m\times m$ table $T$ , as a matrix obtained from $k=0,\dots,m$ and $n=k,\dots,k+m$ values of $T(k,n)$ . Let $i,j=0,\dots,m$ be the indices of rows/columns. Now, we get $T'$ by taking the differences of consecutive terms horizontally (vertically) of $T$ , then $T''$ by taking differences of consecutive terms vertically (horizontally) of $T'$ . We can now use $T''$ to reconstruct $T'$ to reconstruct $T$ , and finally to get $T(k,n)$ . Now we want to solve for a pattern in terms of the table (matrix) $T''$ . Most of its values are now given explicitly as sequences of consecutive prime gaps , whose starting value (offset) is given by the row (column). A closed form seems possible! But there is a problem. There exists a ""critical"" region of terms which are neither trivial (zero), nor given by prime gaps. These terms are the only thing now preventing a formulation of a ""closed form"". I have made a script to compute and color $m=75$ table $T''$ in excel: (click to open, then click to zoom in, to see exact values, in this 2400x2400 picture of the table) Where $\color{red}{\text{red}}$ region are the terms given by prime gaps, $\color{green}{\text{green}}$ are trivial (zero) terms, and black terms represent the ""critical region"", where I do not see any clear patterns. My question here, now boils down to, Can we find a ""closed form"" for the ""critical region"" terms? (To combine it with the pattern for prime gaps, and obtain a ""closed form"" pattern for the entire table $T''$ .) That is, can we calculate the terms in and near the critical region, without relying on computing the longest runs of subsets? - And instead, calculate them by defining pattern sequences, similar to prime gaps? (Prime gaps exactly represent the red region - can we solve the black region?). [ $6.$ ] Characterization of critical region? If we can't easily fully characterize the critical region, are there things that we can say about it? I have made some observations about the critical region, but I wasn't able to characterize it fully. Let ""strips"" refer to rows/columns of $T''$ . I have observed that: Sum invariant of strips. Looks like, the sums over individual strips (rows/columns), are invariant, regardless if terms belong to expected prime gap pattern or to the critical region pattern. That is, we know the critical region terms differ from expected prime gaps. - Now, we also know that they still maintain the sum of those expected prime gaps. For example, observing the included table image, in column $\text{G}$ we have an example of an isolated part of a critical strip, with values $(10,0)$ , in $18,19$ th rows, instead of the expected prime gaps $(4,6)$ . But both, sum to the same expected value: $10+0=4+6$ . Or another example, in column $\text{E}$ , in rows $15-21$ , we have ciritcal terms $(20,12,-18,0,20,-4,0)$ instead of expected prime gaps $(2,6,4,2,6,4,6)$ , and both sequences sum to $30$ . This seems to hold in all strips, and in individual isolated parts, if we observe a sufficient amount of surrounding terms. This means, we could assume all critical terms are prime gaps, and get a closed form approximation for $T''$ , that will only be incorrect in the critical region. The only exceptions seem to be, parts where critical region is ""very mixed"" with the trivial region. This means, we can establish a ""closed form"" $T(k, n)$ approximation, that is ( ""almost"" ) exactly correct only if $k$ is sufficiently close to $n$ . (Which is most of the time, if you observe the ratio of areas of red and black regions in the included table image.) We still don't have an exact ""closed form"", that is, a full characterization of $T(k, n)$ , but, we can now analyse the asymptotics of $T(k, n)$ , with such an approximation. What remains, is, to characterize the beginnings and endings of isolated critical region strips, and structure inside them. - So far, I only know about the invariant sum property .","Table of contents [ ] Definition [ ] Implication.

We further assume all bad subsets $B$ have $|B|>1$ . Suppose $\mathcal C\subseteq \mathcal P(S)$ is a covering of $S$ ; that is, $S= \bigcup_{C\in\mathcal C} C$ . We say a subset $T\subset S$ is good if $B\not\subset T$ for any $B\in \mathcal B$ ; that $\mathcal C$ is good if any $C\in \mathcal C$ is good; and that $\mathcal C$ is minimal good if $|\mathcal C|$ is minimal among all good coverings of $S$ . For example, if $S=\{a,b,c\}$ and $\mathcal B=\{\{a,b\},\{b,c\}\}$ , the singleton set $\{\{a\},\{b\},\{c\}\}$ is a good covering, and $\{\{a,c\},\{b\}\}$ is the unique minimal good covering. However, if $S=\{a,b,c,d\}$ and $\mathcal B=\{\{a,b\},\{c,d\}\}$ , then both $\{\{a,c\},\{b,d\}\}$ and $\{\{a,d\},\{b,c\}\}$ are minimal good coverings. Question: Given $S$ , $\mathcal B$ , is there a straightforward way to generate a minimal good covering, either directly or with an efficient algorithm? (Or put another way: how can we generate a minimal collection of sets which dominate all subsets (in the inclusion partial order) except those which are supersets of a particular collection of sets.) Naively, this requires searching $\mathcal P(S)$ , so is exponential in $|S|$ . Some observations: If there is a subset $X\subset S$ such that either $X\subseteq B$ or $X\cap B=\emptyset$ for all $B\in \mathcal B$ , then we can quotient out by $X$ (i.e. identify those elements) and solve the problem for $S'$ , where $|S'|=|S|-|X|+1$ . If we can find a maximal good set; that is, a good set $T\subset S$ such that $|T|$ is maximal with this property; then if $\mathcal C'$ is a minimal good covering of $S-T$ , $\mathcal C'\cup \{T\}$ is a good covering of $S$ . However, it may not be minimal : e.g. if $S=\set{a,b,c,d,e}$ , and $B=\set{B\subset S\mid |B|\geq 4}\cup\set{\set{a,b}}$ , then $T=\set{c,d,e}$ is maximal good, and $\mathcal C'=\set{\set{a},\set{b}}$ . However, it is easy to see that $\set{\set{a,d,e},\set{b,c}}$ is a minimal good covering. Edit (for posterity): This problem is equivalent to finding a minimal hypergraph coloring , which, as the answer notes, includes graph coloring as a subcase.","Let be a set and a collection of subsets; we will call a bad subset of .

(Or put another way: how can we generate a minimal collection of sets which dominate all subsets (in the inclusion partial order) except those which are supersets of a particular collection of sets.) Naively, this requires searching , so is exponential in . Some observations: If there is a subset such that either or for all , then we can quotient out by (i.e. identify those elements) and solve the problem for , where . If we can find a maximal good set; that is, a good set such that is maximal with this property; then if is a minimal good covering of , is a good covering of . However, it may not be minimal : e.g. if , and , then is maximal good, and . However, it is easy to see that is a minimal good covering. Edit (for posterity): This problem is equivalent to finding a minimal hypergraph coloring , which, as the answer notes, includes graph coloring as a subcase.","\newcommand{set}[1]{\left\{#1\right\}} S \mathcal B\subseteq \mathcal P(S) B\in \mathcal B S B |B|>1 \mathcal C\subseteq \mathcal P(S) S S=

A relation $\geq$ on $K$ is called a weak ordering if it is transitive and complete (for each $x,y\in K$ , either $x\geq y$ or $y\geq x$ or both). There is a set $N$ of $n\geq 2$ weak orderings on $K$ , and a number $m \leq n$ . We would like to create a new weak ordering $\succsim$ on $K$ with the following agreement property : $x\succsim y$ only if at least $m$ orderings in $N$ agree that $x \geq y$ . For what values of $m$ (as function of $n,k$ ) is it possible to create this $\succsim$ ? When $m=n$ this might be impossible even for $k=2$ . As an example, suppose $K = \{x,y\}$ , and the set $N$ contains $n=2$ weak orderings: one with $x\geq y$ and one with $y\geq x$ . Then, with $m=2$ , the agreement property implies that neither $x\succsim y$ nor $y\succsim x$ - but then $\succsim$ is not a complete relation. When $m \leq n/2$ , this is possible for $k=2$ . Suppose $K = \{x,y\}$ . Since each ordering in $N$ is complete, it contains either at least $n/2$ relations for which $x\geq y$ , or at least $n/2$ relations for which $y\geq x$ (or both). In the former case set $x\succsim y$ , in the latter case set $y\succsim x$ . The resulting relation is a weak ordering and it satisfies the agreement property. In general, when $m \leq n/k!$ , this is possible, since by the pigeonhole principle, there exists an ordering of the elements that is contained in at least $n/k!$ relations in $N$ , so we can make $\succsim$ equal to this relation. Is it possible for $m > n/k!$ ? What is the largest $m$ (as a function of $n$ and $k$ ) for which this is possible? EDIT: I think it is possible whenever $m \leq n/k$ . Construct the new relation as follows. If $x\geq y$ for more than $n (k-1)/k$ orderings in $N$ , then set $x\succsim y$ . Add to $\succsim$ , all the relations that follow from the existing relations by transitivity. Complete the remaining relations arbitrarily in any way consistent with transitivity.

Indeed, suppose we have a chain of $l-1$ relations, i.e., $x_1 \succsim x_2 \succsim \cdots \succsim x_l$ , where each of these $\succsim$ relations was added in step 1. So each such relation is agreed by more than $(k-1)n/k$ base relations. So each such relation is disagreed by less than $n/k$ base relations.

Label the edges in the simple path $e_1, e_2, ..., e_k$ in $G$ in order of connectedness and label the vertices in the simple path just constructed $v_1, v_2, ..., v_k$ respectively. Then, on each pair of vertices $(v_i,v_{i+1}), i = 1, 2, ..., k-1$, construct the complete graph $K_{r}$ using both $v_i$ and $v_{i+1}$ and $r-2$ new vertices, where $r$ is the number of edges incident on the vertex in $G$ shared by $e_i$ and $e_{i+1}$. Since every complete graph contains a Hamiltonian path between any two vertices, this line graph can be traversed by following such a path in the complete graph from $v_i$ to $v_{i+1}$ when available, and otherwise going straight from $v_i$ to $v_{i+1}$. Have I missed anything? I am struggling to come up with ideas for the converse.","Here the line graph $L(G)$ of $G$ is defined by $L(G) := (E,\{ef : e,f \in E, e \bigcap f \neq \oslash\})$.

86,Asymptotic Growth of Generalised Catalan Numbers,Asymptotic Growth of Generalised Catalan Numbers,,"I'm trying to understand the asymptotic behaviour of a family of integer sequences related to the Catalan numbers $\left( c_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$.  The OEIS suggests that these are known as generalised Catalan numbers; I'm not sure if this term is used more widely.  I think I've been able to figure a lot of this out by myself, but I'd appreciate suggestions for any suitable reference I could look up to better understand things. Recall that the Catalan numbers have generating function $F(z)$ where $$F(z) = \frac{1-\sqrt{1-4z}}{2z} .$$ Now for any integer $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ let the 'generalised` Catalan numbers of type $k$ be the integer sequence $(c^{[k]}_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ with generating function $F_k(z)$ satisfying $$F_k(z) = \frac{1}{1-kzF(z)}.$$ For example, $(c^{[1]}_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ are just the (ordinary) Catalan numbers and $(c^{[2]}_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ are the central binomial coefficients.  In these two cases we have exact formulas: $$ c^{[1]}_n = \frac{1}{n+1} {2n \choose n}$$ and $$ c^{[2]}_n = {2n \choose n} .$$ We can use these, together with Stirling's approximation , to show that $$ c^{[1]}_n \sim \frac{4^n}{\sqrt{\pi n^3}} $$ and $$ c^{[2]}_n \sim \frac{4^n}{\sqrt{\pi n}}.$$ For other $k$ I'm not aware of any similar formulas.  The case $k=0$ is trivial as $c^{[0]}_n = 0$ for all $n > 0$.  And I assume the remaining cases require singularity analysis, which is something I'm not really familiar with. I've been told -- though I don't think I've ever seen a proof -- that when an integer sequence $(a_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ has a generating function $P(z)$ the asymptotic behaviour of the sequence depends on the smallest non-zero singularity $z_0$ of $P(z)$.  In particular, I understand that in this case $a_n \sim \theta(n) |z_0|^{-n}$ for $\theta$ some subexponential function. In the case of $F_k(z)$ as long as $k \neq 0$ there are two singularities: a pole at $z=\frac{k-1}{k^2}$ and a branch point at $z=\frac{1}{4}$.  Since $$0 < \left|\frac{k-1}{k^2}\right| < \frac{1}{4} $$ for all integers $k$ other than those in $$I := \left\{ -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 \right\}$$ this means that for $k \notin I$ we should have $$c^{[k]}_n \sim \theta_k(n) \left( \frac{k^2}{k-1} \right)^n . $$ I'm not sure how in general one would go about finding $\theta_k$.  In fact, by trial and error I've persuaded myself that -- again, for $k \notin I$ -- we have $$ c^{[k]}_n \sim \frac{k-2}{k-1} \left( \frac{k^2}{k-1} \right)^n $$ but again I'm not sure how to prove this to be true. The remaining cases should, I assume, be of the form $c^{[k]}_n \sim \theta_k(n) 4^n$.  This is true for $k=1$ and $k=2$ (shown above).  And it's apparently true for the case $k=-1$, as Fung Lam (on the OEIS) gives the estimate $$c^{[-1]}_n \sim - \frac{4^n}{9 \sqrt{\pi n^3}}.$$ I've not been able to even guess what the subexponential term should be for the remaining three cases. In summary then, I really have two questions: Are the particular estimates for the asymptotic growth of $c^{[k]}_n$ that I suggest above correct?  Is anything known about the cases $k \in \{-4,-3,-2\}$? In general, how can I derive expressions for the asymptotic behaviour of an integer sequence if I know its generating function?

For example, for k=10)        .111251780630393896979680584629184521  k=100)      0.1010102040921523031574757410327e-1  k=1000)     0.1001001002004009021051127323837e-2  k=10000)    0.00010001000100020004000900210051 as K increases by powers of 10 the number of padding zeros increases but more terms of the sequence are observable. In this case the sequence is: 1,1,1,2,4,9,21,51,127,323,835... which is equivalent to Sloane's A001006 , the Motzkin numbers (with an additional leading '1').  For K= 99999999999999999999999999999999999999999 one of the points results in a sequence of: 1,2,4,9,23,65,197,626,2056... which is Sloane's A014137 , partial sums of Catalan numbers. As you might guess, various other large K repdigits and near repdigits create their own sequences. In short, can anyone point me to references on this or related items? I've had little luck looking online and I'm not a mathematician so my knowledge of the literature is limited. P.S. I generate solutions using Maple: proc (z) -> solve({x+y = 1+1/z, 1/x+1/y = z}, {x, y}) end proc;",,"['combinatorics', 'number-theory', 'reference-request']"
94,Most efficient algorithm to neutralize all positive and negative,Most efficient algorithm to neutralize all positive and negative,,"So I've been lately working on an app which requires me to code this algorithm. But I'm unsure what I've come up with is the most efficient algorithm. Say I have 2 sets (or rather arrays, as there can be duplicates) A and B with all positive values in A and all negative values in B. Ex - A = {1, 3, 1} (sum = 5) B = {-2, -3} (sum = -5) The sum of all elements in both the array will always be 0 (-5 + 5 = 0). The number of elements might be different. Now what is the most efficient way (minimum steps) to neutralize all values? For example one way: -3 + 1 = -2 Now A looks like: {0, 3, 1} and B looks like: {-2, -2} Then -2 + 3 = 1 Now A looks like: {0, 1, 1} and B looks like {0, -2} Now doing 2 more steps. Hence total of 4 steps. Can I compute the most efficient solution for this? How? My take was to neutralize first the exact matching values (makes 2 elements 0 directly). Then look for biggest in positive and start merging with biggest in negative as long as possible. But it is just intuitive thinking from my side. Is there any efficient algorithm to this?","So I've been lately working on an app which requires me to code this algorithm. But I'm unsure what I've come up with is the most efficient algorithm.
