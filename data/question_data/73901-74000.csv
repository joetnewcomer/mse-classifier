10,Two points of view on constructible sets,Two points of view on constructible sets,,"This question is aimed at understanding the relationship between two different definitions of the constructible sets in a Noetherian scheme, both of which I encountered in Atiyah-MacDonald's Introduction to Commutative Algebra (henceforth AM). It follows up a question I asked before , which was beautifully answered by user hot_queen . The setup: Let $X$ be a set and $\{U_\lambda\}_{\lambda\in\Lambda}\subset 2^X$ a family of subsets of $X$ that is closed under finite intersection, so it serves as a base for a topology $\mathscr{T}$. Let $\mathscr{F}$ be the smallest family of subsets of $X$ that contains $\mathscr{T}$ and is closed under complementation and finite intersection. By exercise 20 of ch. 7 in AM, $\mathscr{F}$ is equivalently the family of finite unions of locally closed sets. AM defines this as the constructible sets in exercise 21 of the same chapter. Meanwhile, let $\mathscr{G}$ be the coarsest topology in which every $U_\lambda$ is clopen. In exercises 27-28 of chapter 3 of AM, it is shown that if $X$ is the Spec of a ring $B$ and the $U_\lambda$'s are the standard basic opens of the Zariski topology, then this is precisely the topology in which the images in $X$ of the Specs of all $B$-algebras are taken as the closed sets. AM defines this as the constructible topology in exercise 27. AM notes that the closed sets are exactly the images of Specs, so I infer that it is the closed sets of this topology (i.e. the image in $2^X$ of the family $\mathscr{G}$ under complementation of each member; call it $\mathscr{G}^c$) that AM means to refer to as constructible. $\mathscr{F}$ is not equal to $\mathscr{G}$ or $\mathscr{G}^c$ in the generality in which I've defined them. In fact $\mathscr{G}$ depends on the base $\{U_\lambda\}$ chosen for $\mathscr{T}$ whereas $\mathscr{F}$ only depends on $\mathscr{T}$. See hot_queen's answer to my question linked above for beautiful simple examples of the differences. (I framed that question in terms of $\mathscr{F}$ vs. $\mathscr{G}$, since I forgot the context in AM ch. 3 of the def. of $\mathscr{G}$, but the examples show the same for $\mathscr{G}^c$ because $\mathscr{F}$ is invariant under complementation.) I assume, however, since AM is using the same word for them, that if $X$ is the Spec of a noetherian ring, $\mathscr{T}$ is the Zariski topology, and $\{U_\lambda\}$ are the standard basic sets $X_f$ of this topology (i.e. the Specs of the localizations of the underlying ring at single elements), then $\mathscr{F}$ coincides with $\mathscr{G}^c$.

Does it remain true if we use a different base for the Zariski topology (e.g. the whole topology)? If yes, does it matter what base?

My question: In the last line what good does it serve by using ""expected value"" in  the line: expected value of the utility function $u_i$ with domain $[0,1]$ Instead, what will we lose if we just write: ""...represented by the utility function $u_i$ with domain $[0, 1]$.""$?$ (i.e we drop expected value) EDIT 1: (added after reading @Shane 's answer) In the above question Set $A = \{(a_1, a_2) \in \mathbb R^2: a_1 + a_2 \le 1$ and $a_i  \ge 0$   for $i = 1, 2\}$,    $D=(0,0) \in A$, $D$ is the disagreement event .   For each Player $i$ there is a function $u_i:A \cup \{D\} \to \mathbb R$   , called a utility function, such that one lottery is preferred to   another if and only if the expected utility of the first exceeds that   of the second . Here I am not able to visualize a lottery $L$ as is mentioned in the answer by @Shane. What will this lottery look like? When calculating the expected value, which all elements of $A$ will we take into consideration (since $A$ is a non denumerable infinite set)? PS: It is taken from the famous, Nash's Axiomatic Bargaining Theory . EDIT 2: @Shane I know about vNM utility theorem. The problem is, I am not able to apply it here. Here $A = \{(a_1, a_2) \in \mathbb R^2: a_1 + a_2 \le 1$ and $a_i  \ge 0 \}$. So $A$ has infinite elements. A typical $A$ would look like $\{(0.1,0.9),(0.2,0.4),(0.5,0.1),(0,0)...\}$. It will have infinite elements. In this particular example let us call $p=(0.1,0.9),q=(0.2,0.4),r=(0.5,0.1),s=(0,0)$. So for Agent $1$, $r\succ q \succ p \succ s $ since $r_1\gt q_1 \gt p_1 \gt s_1$. (If choosing among the above four alternatives only). Here, Nash says that each player's preference be defined on a set of lotteries over possible agreements and not just on the set of agreements themselves. Further: one lottery is preferred to another if and only if the expected   utility of the first exceeds that of the second . Let us say that $u_i(a)=a_i$ where $a \in A$ and $i=1,2$ So if I try to construct a lottery , say $L=t_1 \cdot p+t_2\cdot q+t_3\cdot r+t_4\cdot s$ where $\Sigma t_i = 1$ and $M=x_1\cdot p+x_2\cdot q+x_3\cdot r+x_4\cdot s$ where $\Sigma x_i = 1$ and $p,q,r,s \in A$. By vNM, for agent 1, $L \succ M$ iff $t_1u_1(p)+t_2u_1(q)+t_3u_1(r)+t_4u_1(s) \gt x_1u_1(p)+x_2u_1(q)+x_3u_1(r)+x_4u_1(s)$ OR, $t_1p_1+t_2q_1+t_3r_1+t_4s_1 \gt x_1p_1+x_2q_1+x_3r_1+x_4s_1$ Right? My doubts: here I just picked up $4$ elements of $A$. But there are infinite such elements in $A$. So how will I come up with a lottery? I mean we will not get such $t_i $ or $x_i $ such that $\Sigma t_i = 1$ or $\Sigma x_i = 1$. EDIT 3 Our agreement set is as usual $A=\{a_1, a_2, a_3 \cdot \cdot \cdot\}$ where $a_k$s are various agreements over which the two agents can reach. If the two agents do not reach to an agreement then disagreement event $D=(d_1,d_2)$ is invoked. Let a general element of the set $A$ be denoted by $a$. For example in the case of our “splitting the dollar game” the agreement set, $A = \{(a_1, a_2) \in \mathbb R^2: a_1 + a_2 \le 1$ and $a_i \ge 0$ for $i = 1, 2\}$. Here $D=(0,0)$ Now the text (in the above mentioned book) says: Denote by $p \cdot  a$ the lottery in which the agreement $a \in A$ is   reached with probability $ p \in [0, 1]$  and the disagreement event $D= (d_1,d_2)$    occurs with probability $1 – p$. Let $\succcurlyeq _i$ be Player $i’$s preference ordering over lotteries of the form $p \cdot a$, and   let $\succ _i$ denote strict preference. Consider an agreement $a^*$   with the property that for $(i, j) = (1, 2)$ and $(i, j) = (2, 1)$, for   every $a \in A$ and $p \in [0, 1]$ for which $p \cdot a \succ_i a^*$   we have $p \cdot a^* \succcurlyeq_j a$.

Page 17 under the chapter The Axiomatic Approach: Nash's Solutions: . Two individuals can divide a dollar in any way they wish. If they fail   to agree on a division, the dollar is forfeited. The individuals may,   if they wish, discard some of the dollar.   In terms of our model, we   have   $A = \{(a_1, a_2) \in \mathbb R^2: a_1 + a_2 \le 1$ and $a_i > \ge 0$ for $i = 1, 2\}$  (all possible divisions of the dollar), and    $D = (0, 0)$ (neither player receives any payoff in the event of   disagreement).

48,How to draw Congressional districts to mirror the Popular Vote,How to draw Congressional districts to mirror the Popular Vote,,"Let me preface this by saying that I'm not sure whether this is fundamentally a mathematical question or not, but I think it is. In the United States, the House of Representatives is elected roughly as follows.  The country is divided into 435 contiguous congressional districts, drawn in such a way that each district contains approximately the same number of people.  And the people in each district elect one person to represent them in the House of Representatives. Suppose for simplicity that there are only two political parties, the Democrats and the Republicans.  Now an often-criticized fact about congressional elections is that there is a divergence between the House Popular Vote, the percentage of people all across the country who voted for one party over the other in the Congressional election, and the party control of the House of Representatives, i.e. the percentage of members of the House who belong to each party.  This is sometimes due to gerrymandering, or the intentional drawing of districts to benefit one party or the other, but it's often just due to how the districts are naturally drawn.  To take an extreme example, if people voted for Republicans 1 - 0 in 434 out of 435 districts, and they voted 500-66 for Democrats in the last district, then Republicans would win the House of Representatives 434-1, even though the popular vote would be tied 500-500. Now people often just point to this divergence as a symptom of some other problems that we need to fix, and they propose redrawing district maps to fix those more fundamental problems.  But my question is, what if you made minimizing the divergence your criteria?  That is to say, given only the requirements that the number of districts must stay at 435, that districts must contain equal numbers of people, and that they must be contiguous regions, what is the mathematically optimal way to draw districts such that the the divergence between party control percentages and national popular vote percentages is minimized? Note that I'm not asking for what the actual optimal districts are for the United States would be, I'm just asking what mathematical methods would allow you to solve this general type of problem?  I assume in practice you would just do a numerical simulation where you try lots of different possible district maps until you found one that approximately optimal, but just at an intuitive level, what sort of district drawing scheme would be at least close to optimal?","Let me preface this by saying that I'm not sure whether this is fundamentally a mathematical question or not, but I think it is.

Then $x\in A_{n+1}$ implies that $f^{-1}(x)\cap A_n\ne\emptyset$. Right? So if $f^{-1}(x)\cap A_n=\emptyset$ then $x\notin A_{n+1}$. Is this correct? First I need to show that for $A$ defined in the hint it holds $f(A)=A$. For this to happen it is enough to have $f(A)=\cap_{n\ge 0} f(A_n)$ Because then $f(A)=\cap_{n\ge 1} A_n=\cap_{n\ge 1} A_n\cap X=A$. But got stuck proving the equality.

Show that there exists a non-empty set $A\subset X$ such that   $f(A)=A$. There is a hint to define $A=\cap_{n\ge 0} A_n$ with $A_{n+1}=f(A_n)$ and $A_0=X$. Then $x\in A_{n+1}$ implies that $f^{-1}(x)\cap A_n\ne\emptyset$. Right? So if $f^{-1}(x)\cap A_n=\emptyset$ then $x\notin A_{n+1}$. Is this correct? First I need to show that for $A$ defined in the hint it holds $f(A)=A$. For this to happen it is enough to have $f(A)=\cap_{n\ge 0} f(A_n)$ Because then $f(A)=\cap_{n\ge 1} A_n=\cap_{n\ge 1} A_n\cap X=A$. But got stuck proving the equality.

My questions are: How do I visualize the open (or even just basic open sets) of these spaces? Are there any theoretical tools/big theorems I can use to better understand the topologies on these spaces (without necessarily having the geometric intuition for them)? Are there any patterns of thinking I should follow whenever I have trouble figuring out what open sets of spaces look like, in general? My exposure to topology thus far has been pretty elementary, so I'm hoping the answers won't presuppose too much knowledge (although I'm ready to study as much as I need to to understand them).

If $p$ is not a limit point of $P$, then there exists a neighborhood $N_{p}$ of $p$ such that $N_p$ includes no condensation points of $E$ except for $p$.

For each $b_{k}\in B \cap \mathscr{P}(N_{p})$, choose such a neighborhood $N_{q_{k}} \supset b_{k}$ of some point $q\in N_{p}-\{p\}$.  Now $\{N_{q_{k}}\}$ covers $N_{p}$, and $\bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty}N_{q_{k}}\supset N_{p}$ has at most countably many points of $E$, for it is a union of countably many sets that have at most countably many points of $E$.

As mentioned in my earlier post , completely normal spaces are always normal, and the converse holds with sufficient Choice, but may fail to hold without it. Since disjoint closed sets are separated, then hereditarily normal spaces are normal, and it is readily apparent by definition that perfectly normal spaces are completely normal. I'm given to understand ( i.e. : Wikipedia says) that perfectly normal spaces are hereditarily normal, but I believe that we may need some Choice in proving this. Does anyone know whether perfectly normal spaces are necessarily hereditarily normal in $\mathsf{ZF}$? Also, need a hereditarily normal space be completely normal in $\mathsf{ZF}$?",,"['general-topology', 'axiom-of-choice', 'separation-axioms']"

In this section he proves   the converse: given a set $X$ and a set $C$ of pairs (net,point)   satisfying the four axioms above, there exists a unique topology   on $X$ such that a net $S$ converges to $s∈X$ iff $(S,s)∈C$. In particular, Kelley's convergence class is topologizable while nlab's convergence space may not be. If by omitting some of its axioms, will the generalization of convergence class become equivalent to nlab's convergence space? Thanks and regards!",,"['general-topology', 'elementary-set-theory']"
