The fact that two function elements being related by a chain of direct analytic continuations implies that an appropriate analytic continuation along an arc is possible is clear to me. However, in page 290 Ahlfors is trying to prove the converse. Namely, that the arc from the analytic continuation can be ""followed"" by a chain of direct analytic continuations, from the initial point of the arc to its endpoint. His words are: Conversely, if $\bar{\gamma}$ is given, we can find a chain of direct analytic continuations which follows the arc $\gamma$ in the same way as in the preceding construction. In fact, by Heine-Borel's lemma the parametric interval $[a,b]$ can be subdivided into $[a,t_1], [t_1,t_2], \dots , [t_{n-1},b]$ such that $\bar{\gamma}(t)$ = $(f_k,\gamma(t))$ in $[t_{k-1},t_k]$ for suitably chosen function elements $(f_k,\Omega_k)$.

98,If an analytic $f$ is injective on $\partial D$ then $f$ is injective on $D$ [duplicate],If an analytic  is injective on  then  is injective on  [duplicate],f \partial D f D,"This question already has an answer here : One-one analytic functions on unit disc (1 answer) Closed 1 year ago . Let $f(z)$ be analytic in a simply connected domain $D$ and on its boundary, the simple closed contour $C$ . If $f(z)$ is injective on $C$ , then $f(z)$ is injective on $D$ . If $z_0\in D$ is a point such that $f(z_0)\notin f(C)$ then we can use an argument principle to conclude $f(z_0) = f(z)$ then $z =z_0$ for $z\in D$ . This is because by assumption, $f(C)$ is also a simple closed curve. But if there is a point $z\in C$ such that $f(z_0) =f(z)$ then the integrand in the argument principle is not well-defined so I can't use this method. I think the open mapping theorem and maximum modulus principle imply this cannot happen but I can't see the explicit contradiction. Please help. Edit: There was a comment given by Aphelli which is incomplete but I wonder if it can be resolved: So the idea is using the argument principle with a slight modification on $C$ . Since $f$ is holomorphic on $\overline{D}$ , there is an open set $U\supset\overline{D}$ such that $f\in\mathcal{H}(U)$ . Since $C$ is compact, we can find a simple close curve $C'\subset U$ enclosing $C$ as close as we want. Once we can show there is such $C'$ that $f$ is injective on $C'$ then we can apply the argument principle as before to prove the statement. The problem is the existence of such $C'$ . Showing the existence of $C'$ such that $f'\neq 0$ on $C'$ is easy but this only ensures local injectivity on $C'$ .","This question already has an answer here : One-one analytic functions on unit disc (1 answer) Closed 1 year ago .

99,Bounding $\sin(\pi z)$ away from $0$ on a circular contour in $\Bbb C$,Bounding  away from  on a circular contour in,\sin(\pi z) 0 \Bbb C,"I'm currently trying to show the following: Let $C_R$ be the circle of radius $R=N+\frac{1}{2}$ for some $N\in\Bbb N$ . Then $$\lim_{R\to\infty}\ \int_{C_R}\frac{1}{z^2\sin(\pi z)}\,dz=0.$$ This will follow immediately if we can prove $\sin(\pi z)$ is bounded away from zero on the contour. To that end, I've shown $|\sin(\pi z)|\geq1$ for $z\in C_R$ is equivalent to proving the inequality $$\cosh(x)\geq 2+\cos\left(\sqrt{(2\pi R)^2-x^2}\right)$$ for $-2\pi R\leq x\leq2\pi R$ . This brings me to my question: How can we prove this inequality? I've thought of trying to use Taylor series here, but $x$ isn't necessarily close to $0$ . I also thought of this as a Calculus I style problem (after all, we're just minimizing a single-variable function), but the derivative was too convoluted to reasonably work with unless I missed something. The plots that I know how to make on Mathematica agree with my computations, so I have reason to believe this is the correct idea, I'm just not sure how to formally prove it.","I'm currently trying to show the following: Let be the circle of radius for some .
