19,Is there an injective function $f:\mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^2$ that maps circles to $n$-gons?,Is there an injective function  that maps circles to -gons?,f:\mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^2 n,"Fix $n\geq 3$ . Does there exist an injective function $f:\mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^2$ such that the image of any circle in $\mathbb{R}^2$ under the map $f$ is a (simple) $n$ -gon in $\mathbb{R}^2$ ? A friend of mine showed me this problem a few days ago without an answer, and we have been trying to answer it for the better part of 3 days with no luck. We don't really have an intuition about whether or not a function like this exists, but we have managed to prove some partial results. If we do not require that $f$ is an injection then the answer is positive. Let $g:\mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ be the projection map $g(x,y)=x$ and let $P$ be any $n$ -gon in $\mathbb{R}^2$ . Since $|P|=|\mathbb{R}|=|\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Q}|$ , we can choose a bijection $\varphi:\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Q}\rightarrow P$ , and define $h:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow P$ by $h(x)=\varphi(x+\mathbb{Q})$ . If we define $f=h\circ g$ , then $f(C)=P$ for every circle $C\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ . If we require that $f$ is continuous and injective then the answer is negative. Assume $f$ exists for a contradiction. Let $C$ be a circle in $\mathbb{R}^2$ , and let $p\in\mathbb{R}^2$ such that $f(p)$ lies on an edge (not a vertex) of $f(C)$ . Since $f$ is continuous, then its restriction $f|_C$ to the closed interior of $C$ is uniformly continuous. Take a sequence $D_m$ of circles in the tangent to $C$ at $p$ in the interior of $C$ so that $D_m$ converges to $C$ (in the Hausdorff metric). Since $f|_C$ is uniformly continuous, then $f(D_m)$ converges to $f(C)$ . Since $f(D_m)$ and $f(C)$ are $n$ -gons, it's clear that $\text{vertex}(f(D_m))$ converges to $\text{vertex}(f(C))$ . Since each $D_m$ is tangent to $C$ at $p$ , then $f(D_m)\cap f(C)=f(D_m\cap C)=\{f(p)\}$ , so since $f(p)$ is not a vertex of $f(C)$ then $f(p)$ must be a vertex of $f(D_m)$ , since otherwise $f(D_m)\cap f(C)$ would be infinite.

(Like for pseudo-Riemannian manifolds the Hawking-Penrose theorems pin down many generic scenarios) Like from $\mathbb{R}^2$ (with the standard metric) if one removes the point $(0,0)$ then there is no geodesic from say the point $(-1,0)$ to $(1,0)$. But I can't visualize how I can actually put a complete metric on this punctured plane and make it geodesically complete? I can try to make the metric hyperbolic near the deleted point so that the geodesics approaching it never actually reach it but go off to infinity but even then I can't see how it will produce a geodesic which connects $(-1,0)$ to $(1,0)$ Also there are two other ways of producing geodesic incompleteness which I know but don't have a good understanding of, Any open subset of a complete connected Riemannian manifold is geodesically incomplete. (I guess this follows from Hopf-Rinow but I can't see it clearly) A noncompact surface which is not diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$, and if for some metric every point on this surface has positive curvature, then the metric on it must be incomplete. I would be happy to see explanations about the above things and also examples for the second case. Also is it possible to write down as formulas simple examples of incomplete geodesics?",,"['general-topology', 'differential-geometry']"

However, if each curve on a finite interval has nowhere dense range, then $\mathbb{R}^2$ would be the union of countable many nowhere dense sets and then be of the first category, contrary to the Baire Category Theorem. So why exactly is the range of a curve on a finite interval nowhere dense? It seems intuitively true. If I let $B=\{(f(t),g(t))\mid t\in I\}$ for some finite interval $I\subset\mathbb{R}$ be the range of some $C^1$ curve, then my feeling is this range looks like some ""segment"" in $\mathbb{R}^2$. If $U\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ is any open set, I want to find an open $V\subset U$ where $B\cap V=\emptyset$. Intuitively, it seems like I could just take some open ball of small enough radius in $U$ that doesn't meet $B$ in the plane, so the range is nowhere dense. Is there a more formal way to express this? Thanks.",,"['general-topology', 'analysis']"
