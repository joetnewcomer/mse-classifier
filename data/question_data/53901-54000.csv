All the formulas I know for $\pi$ involve series or products or special functions (such as inverse trig functions). Or one can use Stirling's approximation if factorials are allowed. I'm wondering if there exists a function $F:\mathbb{Z}^m\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that $F$ can be written in terms of a finite number of additions, subtractions, multiplications, divisions, and exponentiations, and $$ \pi = \lim\limits_{n\rightarrow\infty} F(\underbrace{n,n,\cdots,n}_{r \text{ times}},k_1,k_2,k_3,\dots,k_{m-r}) $$ for some fixed integers $m$ , $r$ , and $k_1,k_2,\dots,k_{m-r}$ . In particular, a formula that is defined by a series, infinite product, recursive formula, or continued fraction would not satisfy these conditions.

Define a set of elementary sequences $S\subset \mathbb{R}^\mathbb{Z}$ as follows: Let $S_0=\{n\}\cup\{\text{all constant, integer-valued sequences}\}$ and define $S_i$ recursively by $$ S_i = \left\{ s_n+t_n,\, s_nt_n,\, (s_n)^{t_n},\, s_n-t_n,\, \frac{s_n}{t_n}\, \mid\, (s_n),(t_n)\in S_{i-1} \right\}. $$ Then let $S = \bigcup\limits_{i=0}^\infty S_i$ . Does there exist a sequence $(s_n)\in S$ such that $\lim\limits_{n\rightarrow\infty} s_n =\pi$ ? Note that $(s_n)\in S$ implies $(s_n)\in S_i$ for some finite $i$ , which means that each term in the sequence $s_n$ has at most $i$ operations in it. So for example, the sequence $(1+1/n)^n$ is in $S_3$ because it involves 3 operations (one addition, one division, and one exponentiation). A series, such as $s_n = \sum\limits_{k=1}^n \frac{(-1)^k 4}{2k-1}$ is not in $S$ because the number of operations in the $n$ th term is unbounded.","It's a well-known formula that and I'm wondering if there exists a similar formula for .

2,Pi series that converges arbitrarily fast.,Pi series that converges arbitrarily fast.,,"The old series for $\pi$ is this alternating series: $$\pi = 4 \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^i}{2i+1}$$ Now, as already noticed, the series is alternating: adding one term overshoots $\pi$ every time. The partial sums evolve like this: Now, I thought: let's average the partial sum K and partial sum K+1. This will converge faster, right? The result is this: Where the original series is still visible in light grey. Indeed this is a success! It converges faster. But wait! It again is an alternating series. So we can repeat this trick over again. I did all the maths and it turns out you can keep repeating this trick for ever. Which basically causes you to be able to construct a series expansion for $\pi$ with arbitrary convergence speed. I plotted the $log(abs(\pi-s_n(k)))$ functions for some of these series: In the figure above, the selected graph is the Euler Transformed variant: $$\pi = \sum_{n=0}^{K}{\frac{\left( n! \right)^{2}2^{n+1}}{\left( 2n+1 \right)!}}$$ The fastest converging one on this figure is the one obtained after applying this trick 10 times (I wrote some Haskell to calculate this): $$s_{10}\left( k \right)= 4\sum_{i=0}^{k}{\frac{\left( -1 \right)^{i}}{2i+1}} +\; \left( -1 \right)^{k}\; \left( \; -\; \frac{\left( 3.99609375 \right)}{\left( 2k+3 \right)}\; +\; \frac{\left( 3.95703125 \right)}{\left( 2k+5 \right)}\; -\; \frac{\left( 3.78125 \right)}{\left( 2k+7 \right)}\; +\; \frac{\left( 3.3125 \right)}{\left( 2k+9 \right)}\; -\; \frac{\left( 2.4921875 \right)}{\left( 2k+11 \right)}\; +\; \frac{\left( 1.5078125 \right)}{\left( 2k+13 \right)}\; -\; \frac{\left( 0.6875 \right)}{\left( 2k+15 \right)}\; +\; \frac{\left( 0.21875 \right)}{\left( 2k+17 \right)}\; -\; \frac{\left( 4.296875\times10^{-2} \right)}{\left( 2k+19 \right)}\; +\; \frac{\left( 3.90625\times10^{-3} \right)}{\left( 2k+21 \right)} \right)$$ The nice thing about this is that it requires only 10 additional terms, for significant faster convergence and that the rest remains the same.

3,A tough series related with a hypergeometric function with quarter integer parameters,A tough series related with a hypergeometric function with quarter integer parameters,,"Is it possible to express $$ \sum_{n\geq  0}\frac{\binom{4n}{2n}\binom{2n}{n}}{64^n(4n+1)} = \phantom{}_3  F_2\left(\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{4},\frac{3}{4}; 1,\frac{5}{4}; 1\right)  $$ in terms of standard mathematical constants given by Euler sums and values of the $\Gamma$ function? This problem arise from studying the interplay between elliptic integrals, hypergeometric functions and Fourier-Legendre expansions. According to Mathematica's notation we have $$ \sum_{n\geq 0}\frac{\binom{4n}{2n}\binom{2n}{n}}{64^n}y^{2n}=\frac{2}{\pi\sqrt{1+y}}\,K\left(\frac{2y}{1+y}\right) $$ for any $y\in[0,1)$ , where the complete elliptic integral of the first kind fulfills the functional identity $$\forall x\in[0,1),\qquad K(x) = \frac{\pi}{2\cdot\text{AGM}\left(1,\sqrt{1-x}\right)} $$ hence the computation of the above series boils down to the computation of $$ \int_{0}^{1}K\left(\frac{2y^2}{1+y^2}\right)\frac{2\,dy}{\pi\sqrt{1+y^2}}\stackrel{y\mapsto\sqrt{\frac{x}{2-x}}}{=}\frac{\sqrt{2}}{\pi}\int_{0}^{1}\frac{K(x)}{\sqrt{x}(2-x)}\,dx\\=\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-1/2}^{+\infty}\frac{\arctan\sqrt{u}}{\sqrt{u(1+u)(1+2u)}}\,du$$ where $K(x),\sqrt{2-x},\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}},\frac{1}{\sqrt{2-x}}$ all have a pretty simple FL expansion, allowing an easy explicit evaluation of similar integrals. This one, however, is a tougher nut to crack, since $\frac{1}{2-x}$ does not have a nice FL expansion. There are good reasons for believing $\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)$ is involved, since a related series fulfills the following identity: $$ \sum_{n\geq 0}\frac{\binom{2n}{n}^2}{16^n(4n+1)}=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{1}K(x)\,x^{-3/4}\,dx = \frac{1}{16\pi^2}\,\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^4 $$ which ultimately is a consequence of Clausen's formula, stating that in some particular circumstances the square of a $\phantom{}_2 F_1$ function is a $\phantom{}_3 F_2$ function. March 2019 Update : after some manipulations, it turns out that the computation of the original $\phantom{}_3 F_2$ is equivalent to the computation of the integral $$ \int_{0}^{1}\frac{-\log x}{\sqrt{x(1+6x+x^2)}}\,dx = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\int_{0}^{+\infty}\frac{z\,dz}{\sqrt{3+\cosh z}}$$ which is way less scary.

6,"The ""Largeness"" of Subsets of the Natural Numbers","The ""Largeness"" of Subsets of the Natural Numbers",,"Recently, I was thinking about the Erdős conjecture on arithmetic progressions , which says that, if, for a set $A\subseteq\mathbb{N}$ , the sum $\sum_{a\in A}\frac{1}a$ diverges (i.e. ""A is large""), then $A$ has arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. My thoughts on this were that the condition of the sum of reciprocals diverges seems unnatural, so I wanted to study the condition of largeness further. After a bit of work off of an order arising from a certain category, I came up with a conclusion that we can compare the largeness of sets as follows, for subsets $A$ and $B$ of $\mathbb{N}$ : Let $f_A$ and $f_B:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$ such that $f_A(n)$ and $f_B(n)$ are the $n^{th}$ element of $A$ and $B$ respectively. $A$ is larger than $B$ if the following set is small (i.e. sum of reciprocals converge) for some $k>0$ : $$\left\{f_B(n):\frac{f_A(n)}{f_B(n)}>k \right\}$$ Intuitively, this says that $f_A$ and $f_B$ should be within a constant multiple of each other almost all the time, and if $f_A$ is consistently less than $f_B$ , then $A$ must be larger than $B$ (i.e. it has more elements and so $f_A$ grows less quickly). This clearly forms a partial order; there are pathological examples which are incomparable, so it is not a total order - for instance: $$A=\mathbb{N}\cap\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}[(2i)!-(2i-1)!,2(2i)!)$$ $$B=\mathbb{N}\cap\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}[(2i+1)!-(2i)!,2(2i+1)!)$$ where both, containing infinitely many intervals $[x,2x)$ , each having reciprocals sum to about $\log(2)$ are large; however, the ratio of $f_A$ to $f_B$ grows ever further away from $1$ , so neither is larger than the other under my definition. But those are awful functions; primarily, the issue is that $A$ is larger than the set of every other element of $A$ and similarly for $B$ - this contradicts intuition about sets. So, I want to consider only the sets for which $A$ and ""every other element of $A$ "" are equally large and whether my order is a total order in that case. Thus, my question: Suppose $f_A$ and $f_B$ are increasing functions $\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$ such that, for some constant $k$ the two sets: $$\left\{f_A(n):\frac{f_A(2n)}{f_A(n)}>k\right\}$$ $$\left\{f_B(n):\frac{f_B(2n)}{f_B(n)}>k\right\}$$ are small. Is it necessarily true that some $k_2$ can be chosen such that at least one of $$\left\{f_B(n):\frac{f_A(n)}{f_B(n)}>k_2 \right\}$$ $$\left\{f_A(n):\frac{f_B(n)}{f_A(n)}>k_2 \right\}$$ is small?","Recently, I was thinking about the Erdős conjecture on arithmetic progressions , which says that, if, for a set , the sum diverges (i.e. ""A is large""), then has arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions.

Update I corrected the layer data; now I managed to find formulas for first $6$ layers: $ a_n(1)=1 $ $ a_n(2)=\frac{1}{2}(2^n-2)$ $ a_n(3)=\frac{2}{3}(3^n-3\cdot2^n+3)$ $ a_n(4)=1( 4^{n} - 4\cdot3^n + 6\cdot2^{n} - 4)$ $ a_n(5)=\frac{8}{5}(5^n - 5\cdot4^n + 10\cdot3^n  - 10\cdot 2^{n}+5)$ $ a_n(6)=\frac{8}{3} (6^n - 6\cdot5^n + 15\cdot4^n - 20\cdot3^n + 15\cdot2^n - 6   )$ I noticed the pattern here, and observed that these sequences are given by: $$ a_n(k)=\frac{\lceil 2^{k-2} \rceil}{k}  \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (-1)^i  \binom{k}i  (k-i)^n$$ And the number of apples on the day $n$ is thus given by : $$ A(n)= \sum_{k=1}^n\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (-1)^i  \binom{k}i  (k-i)^n\frac{\lceil 2^{k-2} \rceil}{k} $$ The fact that the formula was observable from the data is nice, but how do you now mathematically show (prove) this expression holds for all $n$? Q: How would one solve this (or similar problems) algebraically to   arrive at this expression? Without relying on computation and pattern   analysis? What if the growing condition per apple was slightly changed; what are the methods to solve this and similar problems?",,"['sequences-and-series', 'combinatorics', 'algebra-precalculus']"

22,Count valid colourings on an hexagonal grid,Count valid colourings on an hexagonal grid,,"Tile the infinite plane with hexagons. Colour the hexagons black or white in any way you like, provided there is no line of three hexagons all the same colour. How many such colourings are there? Obviously the answer is infinite. It increases exponentially with the area covered by the hexagons. My question is: how fast? An altenative way to express the answer is in bits per hexagon, i.e. how much binary data can I store per hexagon on average. No triangles Note that three hexagons sharing a vertex cannot all be the same colour, otherwise there will be a line of three somewhere nearby. Lower bound Colour the hexagons red, green and blue such that neighbouring hexagons are coloured differently (this colouring is unique up to reflections). Then recolour the red ones black, the green ones white, and the blue ones at random. This always gives a legal colouring. Not all legal colourings are of this special form. However, just considering colourings of this special form, the information density is $1/3$ (in bits/hexagon). This gives a lower bound on the true information density. Upper bound Cut the plane into parallel strips, each two hexagons wide. Colour each strip independently of the others, avoiding lines of three and triangles. Then put them back together. All legal colourings can be made in this way. Not all colourings made this way are legal. However, considering all such colourings, the information density is about 0.551. This gives an upper bound on the true information density. The figure of 0.551 can be computed by considering adding one hexagon at a time to the end of a semi-infinite two-wide strip. This gives a finite state machine with four states. Counting the number of paths of length $n$ from some arbitrary initial state to each final state gives a recurrence relation: $A_n = A_{n-2} + A_{n-3} + A_{n-4}$. For large $n$, $A_n \sim 1.4655^n$, and $log_2(1.4655) = 0.551$. Update 2017-05-05 @mercio studied strips of width three and four and thereby found upper bounds of $0.472$ and $0.437$.

The roots of the polynomials seem to follow some interesting pattern, as described on this thread. For odd values of $d$ , $S_d$ is divisible by $\left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2$ . For even values of $d$ , it is divisible by $\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$ . $\color{brown}{\textbf{Getting into polynomials}}$ For $\delta\in{\bf N}$ , denote as $F_\delta(X)$ the Faulhaber polynomial : $$F_\delta(X)=\frac{1}{2^{2\delta+2}(\delta+1)}\sum_{q=0}^\delta\binom{2\delta+2}{2q}(1-q)B_{2q}\left[(8X+1)^{\delta+1-q}-1\right],$$ where $(B_n)_{n\in{\bf N}}$ are the Bernoulli numbers .

Or if the first question turns out to be false, what are those values of $d$ for which $T_d$ is reducible? Do they follow some pattern? ( e.g. would it happen that an odd value would be followed by an even value, both sharing the property that $T_d$ is reducible?) $\color{brown}{\textbf{My (failing) ideas}}$ What I thought about doing first is proving that if $P(X)$ is irreducible over ${\bf Q}$ , then $P\left(\frac{X(X+1)}{2}\right)$ is irreducible as well. But it turns out it isn't true, for if simply $P(X)=X$ , then the statement doesn't hold. This means that studying the Faulhaber polynomial just won't work, and one really has to work with the $T_d$ .

I also found that : $$\newcommand{\isEquivTo}[1]{\underset{#1}{\sim}} u_n \isEquivTo{+ \infty} \dfrac{C}{\left( \sqrt{2} \right)^n}$$ where $C \approx 2.564448944368$ , if it can help. I am also trying to figure out the literal expression of $\boldsymbol{C}$ (ideally, in terms of fundamental constants only). #################################################################### UPDATE/EDIT : While I did not manage to find a simplified expression of $u_n$ , I think I did make some progress. $1)$ Firstly, since the sequence $( ( \sqrt{2} )^n \, u_n )_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ converges (towards $C$ ), I find it convenient to let : $$\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, ~ v_n = ( \sqrt{2} )^n \, u_n = \prod\limits_{k=0}^{n-1} \left[ \: 1 + \sqrt{2} \, \sin \left( \dfrac{\pi}{2^{k+3}} \right) \right]$$ Finding the expression of $u_n$ is now equivalent to finding the expression of $v_n$ . $2)$ In order to make the following points easier to read, let : $$\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \, \begin{cases} \, c_n = \cos \left( \dfrac{\pi}{2^{n+4}} \right) \\[10pt] \, s_n = \sin \left( \dfrac{\pi}{2^{n+4}} \right) \\[10pt] \, f(n) = \prod\limits_{k=0}^{n-1} \, \sin \left( \dfrac{\pi}{8} + \dfrac{\pi}{2^{k+4}} \right) \\[10pt] \, g(n) = \prod\limits_{k=0}^{n-1} \, \cos \left( \dfrac{\pi}{8} - \dfrac{\pi}{2^{k+4}} \right) \end{cases} $$ Then, by $( * )$ , we have : $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \, v_n = ( 2 \sqrt{2} )^n \times f(n) \times g(n)$ $3)$ My idea was then to rewrite $f(n)$ , $g(n)$ and $f(n) \times g(n)$ as ""polynomial expressions"" of $\cos \left( \dfrac{\pi}{8} \right)$ and $\sin \left( \dfrac{\pi}{8} \right)$ . In order to achieve this, notice the following : $$\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \, \begin{cases} \, f(n) = \prod\limits_{k=0}^{n-1} \, \left[ s_k \cos \left( \dfrac{\pi}{8} \right) + c_k \sin \left( \dfrac{\pi}{8} \right) \right] \\[10pt] \, g(n) = \prod\limits_{k=0}^{n-1} \, \left[ c_k \cos \left( \dfrac{\pi}{8} \right) + s_k \sin \left( \dfrac{\pi}{8} \right) \right] \end{cases} $$ We can then use a generalization of Newton's binomial expansion to obtain : $$\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \, \begin{cases} \, f(n) = \sum\limits_{k=0}^{n} \, F_n(k) \times \cos^k \left( \dfrac{\pi}{8} \right) \times \sin^{n-k} \left( \dfrac{\pi}{8} \right) \\[10pt] \, g(n) = \sum\limits_{k=0}^{n} \, G_n(k) \times \cos^k \left( \dfrac{\pi}{8} \right) \times \sin^{n-k} \left( \dfrac{\pi}{8} \right) \end{cases} $$ where : $$\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \, \forall k \in \left[ 0,  n \right], \, F_n (k) =  \begin{cases} \, \sum\limits_{0 \, \leq \, i_1 \, < \, \dots \, < \, i_k \, \leq \, n-1} \, \left( \, \prod\limits_{l=1}^{k} s_{i_l} \times \prod\limits_{ \substack{m=0 \\ m \notin \{ i_1, \, \dots \, , \, i_k \} } }^{n-1} c_m \, \right) \quad \mathrm{if} \, \, k \neq 0 \\[10pt] \, \prod\limits_{m=0}^{n-1} c_m \quad \mathrm{if} \, \, k = 0 \end{cases} $$ and : $$\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \, \forall k \in \left[ 0,  n \right], \, G_n (k) =  \begin{cases} \, \sum\limits_{0 \, \leq \, i_1 \, < \, \dots \, < \, i_k \, \leq \, n-1} \, \left( \, \prod\limits_{l=1}^{k} c_{i_l} \times \prod\limits_{ \substack{m=0 \\ m \notin \{ i_1, \, \dots \, , \, i_k \} } }^{n-1} s_m \, \right) \quad \mathrm{if} \, \, k \neq 0 \\[10pt] \, \prod\limits_{m=0}^{n-1} s_m \quad \mathrm{if} \, \, k = 0 \end{cases} $$ One can note that : $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \, \forall k \in \left[ 0, n \right], \, G_n(n-k) = F_n(k)$ $4)$ We can then prove that : $$\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \, f(n) \times g(n) = \sum\limits_{i=0}^{2n} \, \beta_n(i) \times \cos^i \left( \dfrac{\pi}{8} \right) \times \sin^{2n-i} \left( \dfrac{\pi}{8} \right)$$ where : $$\begin{align*} \forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \, \forall i \in \left[ 0, 2n \right], \, \beta_n(i) &= \sum\limits_{k \, = \, \max(i-n, \, 0)}^{\min(i, \, n)} \, F_n(k) \times G_n(i-k) \\[10pt] &= \sum\limits_{k \, = \, \max(i-n, \, 0)}^{\min(i, \, n)} \, F_n(k) \times G_n(n-(n+k-i)) \\[10pt] &= \sum\limits_{k \, = \, \max(i-n, \, 0)}^{\min(i, \, n)} \, F_n(k) \times F_n(n+k-i) \end{align*}$$ We can also note this very nice property : $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \, \forall i \in \left[ 0, 2n \right], \, \beta_n(i) = \beta_n(2n-i) \quad \quad \quad ( ** )$ $5)$ Therefore, we have : $$\begin{align*} \forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \, v_n &= (2 \sqrt{2})^n \times \sum\limits_{i=0}^{2n} \, \beta_n(i) \times \cos^i \left( \dfrac{\pi}{8} \right) \times \sin^{2n-i} \left( \dfrac{\pi}{8} \right) \\[10pt] &= (2 \sqrt{2})^n \times \sin^{2n} \left( \dfrac{\pi}{8} \right) \times \sum\limits_{i=0}^{2n} \, \beta_n(i) \times \cot^i \left( \dfrac{\pi}{8} \right) \end{align*} $$ But, since we have $\cos \left( \dfrac{\pi}{8} \right) = \dfrac{1}{2} \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}} \,$ and $\, \sin \left( \dfrac{\pi}{8} \right) = \dfrac{1}{2} \sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}} \,$ , we then obtain : $$\forall n  \in \mathbb{N}, \, v_n = ( \sqrt{2} - 1 )^n \times \sum\limits_{i=0}^{2n} \, \beta_n(i) \times ( 1 + \sqrt{2} )^i \quad \quad \quad \quad ( *** )$$ But, by $( ** )$ , we also have ( $i \leftrightarrow 2n-i$ ) : $$\begin{align*} \forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \, v_n &= (2 \sqrt{2})^n \times \sum\limits_{i=0}^{2n} \, \beta_n(i) \times \cos^{2n-i} \left( \dfrac{\pi}{8} \right) \times \sin^{i} \left( \dfrac{\pi}{8} \right) \\[10pt] &= (2 \sqrt{2})^n \times \cos^{2n} \left( \dfrac{\pi}{8} \right) \times \sum\limits_{i=0}^{2n} \, \beta_n(i) \times \tan^i \left( \dfrac{\pi}{8} \right) \\[10pt] &= ( 1 + \sqrt{2} )^n \times \sum\limits_{i=0}^{2n} \, \beta_n(i) \times ( \sqrt{2} - 1 )^i \quad \quad \quad \quad ( *** \, * ) \end{align*} $$ $6)$ Thus, since $u_n = \dfrac{v_n}{\left( \sqrt{2} \right)^n}$ , we finally obtain, by $(***)$ and $(*** \, *)$ : $$\boxed{ \begin{align*} \forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \, u_n &= \left( 1 - \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) ^n \times \sum\limits_{i=0}^{2n} \, \beta_n(i) \times ( 1 + \sqrt{2} )^i \\[10pt] &= \left( 1 + \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) ^n \times \sum\limits_{i=0}^{2n} \, \beta_n(i) \times ( \sqrt{2} - 1 )^i \end{align*} } $$ I find these expressions of $u_n$ really intriguing, since the sums remind me a lot of the binomial expansion of $(1+x)^{2n}$ . Indeed, $(1+x)^{2n}= \sum\limits_{i=0}^{2n} \, \binom{2n}{i} \times x^i$ . Additionally, the fact that $\binom{2n}{i}$ equals $\binom{2n}{2n-i}$ is analogous to $(**)$ ... $7)$ My hope was that I could finally finish this off by simplifying $\beta_n(i)$ . Yet, I still haven't managed to do so. However, here are some particular values of $\beta_n(i)$ : $$\begin{cases} \, \beta_n(0) = \beta_n(2n) = \dfrac{1}{2^n} \times \prod\limits_{k=0}^{n-1} \, \sin \left( \dfrac{\pi}{2^{k+3}} \right) \quad \quad (\forall n \geq 0) \\[10pt] \, \beta_n(1) = \beta_n(2n-1) = 2 \times \beta_n(0) \times \sum\limits_{k=0}^{n-1} \, \dfrac{1}{\sin \left( \dfrac{\pi}{2^{k+3}} \right)} \quad \quad (\forall n \geq 1) \\[10pt] \, \beta_n(n) = \sum\limits_{k=0}^{n} \, F_n(k)^2 \quad \quad (\forall n \geq 0) \\[10pt] \end{cases}  $$ What more can be done with $\boldsymbol{\beta_n}$ ?

30,Calculus of variation with discontinuous solutions,Calculus of variation with discontinuous solutions,,"I'm thinking of the following question: Consider a function $f: U\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ where $U=[0,L_1)\cup(L_1,L]$ , and an energy functional $$F=\int_{U}\Big (\frac{\mathrm{d}f}{\mathrm{d}x}\Big)^2\mathrm{d}x.$$ The boundary condition is $f(0)=f(L)=0$ . Also, assume $f$ has a jump discontinuity at $x=L_1$ , i.e., $f(L_1^-)=-f(L_1^+)=-a$ , where $a$ is a constant, and $L_1$ is a variable. The question is: what is the minimum energy? Simple answer: the Euler-Lagrange equation on $[0,L_1)$ and $(L_1,L]$ is $$\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 f}{\mathrm{d}x^2}=0,$$ Therefore we have the following solution: $$f(x) = \begin{cases}  -\frac{a}{L_1}x,  & \text{x$\in [0,L_1)$} \\  -\frac{a}{L-L_1}x+\frac{L}{L-L_1}a, & \text{x$\in (L_1,L]$} \end{cases}$$ Then the energy function $F(L_1)=\frac{a^2}{L_1}+\frac{a^2}{L-L_1}$ . Therefore we have the minimum energy $4a^2/L$ when $L_1=L/2$ . Then I tried Fourier series. The Fourier series for the discontinuous solutions are $$  f(x)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\Big[\frac{4a}{k\pi}\cos\frac{k\pi L_1}{L}+\frac{2aL}{(k\pi)^2}\Big(\frac{1}{L-L_1}-\frac{1}{L_1}\Big)\sin\frac{k\pi L_1}{L}\Big]\sin\Big(\frac{k\pi x}{L}\Big),$$ When we substitute this representation into the energy functional, we get infinite energy. In particular, \begin{align} F(L_1=L/2) &  =\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\Big(4a\cos\Big(\frac{k\pi}{2}\Big)\Big)^2\cdot\frac{1}{2L}\\  & =\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{4a^2}{L}(1+\cos k\pi)~\mathrm{e}^{-\lambda_1 k} & \text{$\lambda_1\to0^+$}\\   & \to\frac{4a^2}{L}\cdot\frac{1}{\lambda_1}\\ \end{align} \begin{align} F(L_1=L/4) & =\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\Big(4a\cos\Big(\frac{k\pi}{4}\Big)-\frac{16}{3}\frac{a}{k\pi}\sin\Big(\frac{k\pi}{4}\Big)\Big)^2\cdot\frac{1}{2L}\\  & =\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{4a^2}{L}\Big(1+\cos \Big(\frac{k\pi}{2}\Big)\Big)~\mathrm{e}^{-\lambda_2 k}\\& +\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\Big(\frac{128a^2}{9L}\frac{1}{(k\pi)^2}\sin^2\Big(\frac{k\pi}{4}\Big)-\frac{64a^2}{3L}\frac{1}{k\pi}\sin\Big(\frac{k\pi}{4}\Big)\cos\Big(\frac{k\pi}{4}\Big)\Big)& \text{$\lambda_2\to0^+$}\\   & \to\frac{4a^2}{L}\cdot\frac{1}{\lambda_2}-\frac{4}{3}\cdot\frac{a^2}{L}\\ \end{align} It is not surprising that the energies are infinite due to the Gibbs phenomenon. However, it is surprising when we take a look at the energy difference: $$F(L_1=L/4)-F(L_1=L/2)=\Big(\frac{4a^2}{L}\cdot\frac{1}{\lambda_2}-\frac{4a^2}{L}\cdot\frac{1}{\lambda_1}\Big)-\frac{4}{3}\cdot\frac{a^2}{L}$$ While when we use $F(L_1)=\frac{a^2}{L_1}+\frac{a^2}{L-L_1}$ , we get $F(L_1=L/4)-F(L_1=L/2)=\frac{4}{3}\cdot\frac{a^2}{L}$ .

It feels like it should, but I just have a few doubts. Like, assume that $(a_n)$ is such a sequence. Find the first $a_i \not = 1$ and the next $a_j, \ \ j > i, \ \ a_j = 1$. Swap $a_j$ and $a_i$. This can be done infinitely many times and the resulting sequence has $1$ at position $M \in \mathbb N$, no matter how large $M$ is. Thus $(a_n) = (1_n)$. Also, consider powerset of $\mathbb N, \ \ 2^{\mathbb N}$. Then form any permutation of these sets, $(b_{n_{\{N\}}})$. Now simply flatten this, take first element $b_1$ and make it first element of $a$ and continue till you come to end of the first set and then the next element in $a$ is the first element of $b_2$... But again, if you start with set $\{1 | k \in \mathbb N\}$ (infinite sequence of ones), you will get the same as in the first case... You would not be able to form a bijection between this sequence and a sequence that lists every natural number once, for if you started $(a_n)$ with listing every natural number once, you would be able to map only the first $\aleph_0$ elements of $(a_n)$ to $\mathbb N$. But consider decimal expansion of $\pi$. Does it contain every natural number infinitely many times? What am I not getting here?
