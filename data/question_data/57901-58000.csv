Here are a few remarks: Since $x\mapsto \frac{2^x}{x}$ is increasing when $x\geq 2$, one might be tempted to use the integral test. This fails: when doing so, one gets $a_n\leq \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{2^k}{k}\leq b_n$ where $a_n\sim \frac{2^n}{\ln (2)n}$ and $b_n\sim \frac{2^{n+1}}{\ln (2)n}$.  Unfortunately $b_n$ is too big and this estimate doesn't yield the limit. Here's my solution: since it's easy to sum $2^k$ and the difference $\frac{1}{k}-\frac{1}{k+1}$ is small, it's natural to try summation by parts: $$\begin{align} \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{2^k}{k} &=\frac{S_n}{n+1}-1+\sum_{k=1}^n S_k \left(\frac{1}{k}-\frac{1}{k+1} \right)\quad \text{where} \; S_n=\sum_{k=0}^n 2^k\\ &= \frac{2^{n+1}}{n+1} + \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{2^{k+1}}{k(k+1)} - \underbrace{1 - \sum_{k=1}^n\left(\frac{1}{k(k+1)}\right) - \frac{1}{n+1}}_{\text{bounded}}\\ \end{align}$$ Intuition suggests $\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{2^{k+1}}{k(k+1)}=o\left(\frac{2^n}n \right)$ but it's not immediate to prove.

How does the closed form for $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac1n - \frac1{a+n}$ look like? (EDIT: where $a=1/p$)","A while ago, I started to look at expressions of the following form: $$ S_p:=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac1n - \frac1{n+1/p}, $$  where $p$ is prime, because otherwise things get too complicated for me at the moment.  What I found so far is the following: $$ S_p= p -\log(2p) - \frac12 \pi \cot\left(\frac\pi p\right) + T_p, $$ where $T_p$ contains $\frac{p-1}2$ terms $t_{p,k}$ of the form:  \begin{cases} \pm 2 \sin\left(\frac{k\pi}{2p}\right) \log\left(\sin\left(\frac{k\pi}{2p}\right)\right) \\ \pm 2 \cos\left(\frac{k\pi}{2p}\right) \log\left(\sin\left(\frac{k\pi}{2p}\right)\right)\\ \pm 2 \sin\left(\frac{k\pi}{2p}\right) \log\left(\cos\left(\frac{k\pi}{2p}\right)\right)  \\ \pm 2 \cos\left(\frac{k\pi}{2p}\right) \log\left(\cos\left(\frac{k\pi}{2p}\right)\right)  \end{cases} An example can be found here .
