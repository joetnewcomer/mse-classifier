In each iteration $i=1,2,\ldots$, the value of $X_i$ is determined based on the value of $X_{i-1}$ as follows: With probability 0.5, $X_i=qX_{i-1}+1$, otherwise, $X_i=(1-q)X_{i-1}+1$, with $0<q<1$. I am interested in the stationary distribution of this process, i.e. $\lim_{i\rightarrow\infty}P(X_i=x)$. Specifically, I am interested in an explanation why this distribution seems so ""rough"" and ""repetitive"" (at least when numerically solving it, see below). Alternatively, I would be grateful for any reference to the literature on this distribution, the name of the process, or anything else to find out more.

Dash dotted lines are the two limits $\frac{1}{1-q}$ and $\frac{1}{q}$ corresponding to the solution of the deterministic geometric series with coefficient $q$ and $(1-q)$.

Specifically, \begin{align*} Y_\infty=1+a_1+a_1a_2+\ldots = \sum_{j=0}^\infty\prod_{i=1}^{j}a_i, \end{align*} with $a_k$ either $q$ or $1-q$ with probability $1/2$. Denoting the first $N$ terms of $Y_\infty$ as $Z_N$, and letting $Z^q_N$ be the first $N$ terms with $a_{N-1}=q$, we obtain: \begin{align*} Z_N^q&=1+\ldots+\prod_{i=1}^{N-2}a_i+q\prod_{i=1}^{N-2}a_i\\ Z_N^{1-q}&=1+\ldots+\prod_{i=1}^{N-2}a_i+(1-q)\prod_{i=1}^{N-2}a_i. \end{align*} Then, we define $R_N^q=Z_\infty^q-Z_N^q$.

Furthermore, both groups have the same mass, and it also follows (I don't do all steps here) that the stationary distributions in the interior of both intervals have to be the same (except scaling of axis), and to be the same as the whole distribution (Note: I have to check this again).

First approach $$\begin{align}s_2 & = \sum_{n,m\ge 1} \frac{1}{n m (n^2+m^2)} \\ & = \sum_{n,m\ge 1} \frac{1}{n m }\int_{0}^{\infty } e^{-t(n^2+m^2)}\;dt\\ & =\int_{0}^{\infty }\left(\sum_{n,m\ge 1} \frac{1}{n m } e^{-t(n^2+m^2)}\right)\;dt\\ & =\int_{0}^{\infty } f_2(t)^2\;dt \end {align}\tag{3}$$ where $$f_2(t) = \sum_{n\ge 1}\frac{e^{-t n^2}}{n}\tag{4}$$ Now $$e^{-n^2 t}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int_{-\infty }^{\infty } e^{-x^2+i 2 n x\sqrt{t} } \, dx\tag{5}$$ This linearizes $n$ in the exponent, and, exchanging integral and sum, we can do the (conditionally convergent) $n$ -sum under the $x$ -integral which gives $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}}\sum _{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{e^{-x^2+i 2 n x \sqrt{t}}}{\sqrt{\pi } n}=-\frac{e^{-x^2}}{\sqrt{\pi}} \log \left(1-e^{2 i x \sqrt{t} }\right)\tag{6}$$ and $$f_2(t) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int_{-\infty }^{\infty } e^{-x^2} \log \left(1-e^{2 i x \sqrt{t} }\right)\, dx\tag{7}$$ Now in the $x$ -integral the imaginary part cancels out due to symmetry and the real part can be simplified so that $$f_2(t) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int_{-\infty }^{\infty } e^{-x^2} \frac{1}{2} \log \left(4 \sin ^2\left(x\sqrt{t} \right)\right)\; dx\tag{8}$$ Alas, here I am stuck, and summing up it seems that I have made a simple looking formula more complicated. Second approach Doing just the $n$ -sum in $s_2$ gives $$s_2 = \sum_{m\ge 1} \frac{1}{2 m^3} (H(i m) + H(-i m))=\Re\left(\sum_{m\ge 1} \frac{1}{m^3} H(i m)\right)\tag{2.1}$$ where $H(z)$ is the harmonic number of argument $z$ . Inserting the representation $$H(z) = \int_{0}^{1} \frac{1-x^z}{1-x}\;dx$$ and performing the $m$ -sum gives an interesting integral representation of our double sum $$s_2 = \left(\int_0^1 \frac{-\zeta (3)+\Re(\text{Li}_3\left(x^i\right))}{x-1} \, dx\right)\tag{2.2}$$","Playing around with double sums related to harmonic numbers and having easily found a closed expression for this sum I attempted to find a closed expression for this slightly more complicated sum which turned out to be more than I could achieve, and I hope for your help.

However, I believe the problem can be solved a different way. If we use the binomial theorem to expand $(1-1/m)^n$ and swap the resulting double sum, we have $$ \lim_{n\to\infty}n\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}(-1)^k\zeta (k+2) $$ Intuitively, this limit should converge because $\zeta(n+2)\to 1$ as $n\to\infty$ , and then the series looks like $\sum_{0\le k\le n}\binom{n}{k}(-1)^k=0$ , but the asymptotics evade me. Previously I was interested in so-called 'alternating binomial zeta series,' (my own clunky descriptor of this object) and found that convergence was quite delicate and subtle. I tried using Stolz-Cesaro, the discrete version of L'Hopital's Rule, but was unsusccessful, though maybe it's possible through this or other means.","In this question it is shown, up to a small detail or two, that The proof essentially involves Taylor series and reimagining the sum as a Riemann integral to show a lower bound and an upper bound each converge to .

Now to get the higher bound, we have the following inequality for all integers $x$ (easily proved through binomial expansion): $$\left(1 + \frac{1}{x}\right)^{x} < e$$ So, $$(1+x) < e^{\frac{1}{x}}$$ Using this inequality many times, we have, (using the formula for sum of a geometric progression) $$a_{k} < e^2$$ Thus, $$\frac{4}{3}\leq a_{k}< e^2$$ Then, to prove that this sequence is converging we show that it has the Cauchy Property. This can be done as follows: First, we have, $$a_{k} = a_{k-1} + \frac{a_{k-1}}{3^k}$$ So adding such equations for $a_{1}$, $a_{2}$ ..... $a_{k}$, we see that all terms cancel out and the following remains: $$a_{k} = a_{1} + \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{k-1}\frac{a_{i}}{3^{i+1}}$$ So, if $m < n$, $$a_{n} - a_{m} = \sum\limits_{i=m}^{n-1} \frac{a_{i}}{3^{i+1}} < a_{n-1}\left(\frac{3^{n} - 3^{m}}{3^{m+n}\times2 }\right)$$ As $a_{k}$ is a increasing sequence, we have used $a_{n-1} > a_{n-2}>....>a_{m} $.

I. $\pi$ and $\pi^2$ There are series with all terms positive for $\pi-3$ and $10-\pi^2$ $$\pi-3=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{3}{(4k+1)(2k+1)(k+1)}$$ (see Lehmer, http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/aa/aa27/aa27121.pdf page 139) and, $$10-\pi^2=\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{1}{((k+1)(k+2))^3}$$ II. $\pi^3$ Regarding $\pi^3\approx 31$, one may equivalently express $\pi^6\approx 961$ from Euler's series $$\frac{\pi^6}{945}=\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{(k+1)^6}$$ and (see Proving $\pi^3 \gt 31$ ), $$\frac{\pi^6}{960}-1=\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{(2k+3)^6}$$ Multiplying the first by $\displaystyle-\frac{63}{2^6}$ and the second by $31^2=961$, then adding them, $$\pi^6-961=\sum_{k=0}^\infty\left(-\frac{63}{(2k+2)^6}+\frac{961}{(2k+3)^6}\right)$$ This series can be rewritten in a single positive fraction per term as $$\pi^6-961=\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{57472 k^6+332736 k^5+786480 k^4+957920 k^3+616380 k^2+185316 k+15577}{64 (k+1)^6 (2 k+3)^6}$$ so it directly proves $\pi^6>961$ and hence $\pi^3>31$.

54,How to deal with alternating series when index $ \to +\infty$ and $ \to - \infty $?,How to deal with alternating series when index  and ?, \to +\infty  \to - \infty ,"This question stems from some exercises in summing the alternating series of iterations of (simple) functions. I get some sort of paradox... Assume $f(x) = x^2 - 0.5$  which has the inverse $ g(x) = \sqrt{0.5+x} $. Let's write the iterates using $h$ as ""iteration-height"" as second parameter: $ f(x,h+1)= f(f(x,h)) \qquad f(x,0)=x $     and $ \qquad g(x,h)$ analoguously. The iterations, if started at $x_0=1$ have two fixpoints: $ x_\omega=\lim_{k\to\infty} f(x_0,h)={1-\sqrt 3 \over 2} \approx -0.366 $ and $ x_{-\omega} = \lim_{k\to\infty} f(x_0,-h) = g(x_0,h) ={1+\sqrt 3 \over 2} \approx 1.366 $. Let's denote the iterates from $x_0$ by the index $x_1 = f(x_0,1), x_2=f(x_0,2),\ldots,x_\omega $ and $x_{-1} = f(x_0,-1), x_{-2}=f(x_0,-2),\ldots, x_{-\omega} $ Now I compute the alternating sums: \begin{align} \operatorname{sp}(x_0)&= \sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k x_k \\\ \operatorname{sn}(x_0)&= \sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k x_{-k} \\\  y(x_0) &= \operatorname{sp}(x_0) + \operatorname{sn}(x_0) - x_0 \\\    &= x_\omega \cdots +x_2 -x_1 + x_0 - x_{-1}+ x_{-2} - \cdots + \cdots x_\omega \end{align} Because the iterations converge to the fixpoint and the sum is alternating each series can be Abel- or Euler summed and I can simply use the sumalt -function in Pari/GP to get numerical values, for instance, \begin{align}  \operatorname{sp}(1)&= \sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k f(1,k) &\approx 0.7098  \\\  \operatorname{sn}(1)&= \sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k f(1,-k)&\approx 0.41976 \\\  y(1) &= \operatorname{sp}(1) + \operatorname{sn}(1) - 1 &\approx\ 0.1296 \\\  \end{align} Intuitively I'd assume, that taking $x_{-4},x_{-2},x_0,x_2,x_4,\ldots$ as central values for the two alternating sums (in steps of two iterations) the results $y(x_{0+2k})$ should be identical for integer k - but apparently this is not true: Pari/GP as well as some checks with Euler-summation give a nonconclusive empirical result.

Where do I go wrong here? [Update] I've seen one source of the problem: this is the two-valuedness of the inverse $f(x)$-function (the taking of squareroot). From this follows the infinite multifoldness of the trajectory if going with negative height. As simple as it is: on the trajectory is $x_0=1, x_1=0.5, x_2=-0.25, x_3=-0.4375,\ldots$ but if we go back from $x_3$ to $x_2$ by $x_2 = f(x_3,-1)= g(x_3) $ we need a correction of sign after taking the squarerroot in g(x) . This inherits to the full trajectory as far as it is in the negative domain. There is some more interesting stuff following from this - indefinities or better: multivaluedness of iteration height of the values on the curve y=x^2-0.5=f(x) near the negative fixpoint - we have a continuous set mapped to itself (with contraction), which may have more consequences also in general, which I cannot yet fully recognize. Hmm, while this solves at least the ""practical"" or ""obvious"" problem before the eyes here, I'm still scared/insecure about the more general problem of summing series if they are assumed with infinite index at both ends (even if things are generally easier if the series have alternating signs). But this question may then be too broad/unspecified for math.SE so maybe I'll later formally ""accept"" some null-answer or I'll retract the whole question.

As simple as it is: on the trajectory is $x_0=1, x_1=0.5, x_2=-0.25, x_3=-0.4375,\ldots$ but if we go back from $x_3$ to $x_2$ by $x_2 = f(x_3,-1)= g(x_3) $ we need a correction of sign after taking the squarerroot in g(x) . This inherits to the full trajectory as far as it is in the negative domain. There is some more interesting stuff following from this - indefinities or better: multivaluedness of iteration height of the values on the curve y=x^2-0.5=f(x) near the negative fixpoint - we have a continuous set mapped to itself (with contraction), which may have more consequences also in general, which I cannot yet fully recognize. Hmm, while this solves at least the ""practical"" or ""obvious"" problem before the eyes here, I'm still scared/insecure about the more general problem of summing series if they are assumed with infinite index at both ends (even if things are generally easier if the series have alternating signs). But this question may then be too broad/unspecified for math.SE so maybe I'll later formally ""accept"" some null-answer or I'll retract the whole question. [end update] For convenience, here is Pari/GP-code to reproduce the behaviour: \\ f can be positively or negatively be iterated: f(x,h=0) = for(k=1,h,x=x^2-0.5);  for(k=1,-h,x=sqrt(0.5+x));  x  \\ helper functions for sumalt. sumalt asks for consecutive iterations \\ so we do not need to compute the full iteration at each function call \\ instead we use a global variable and do only one step of iteration fsa(k,x)=if(k==0,  gl_f=x,   gl_f =      gl_f^2 - 0.5  );  return(gl_f); gsa(k,x)=if(k==0,  gl_f=x,   gl_f = sqrt(gl_f   + 0.5) );  return(gl_f);  fmt(400) \\ check one solution using central value x0=1.0 x=1.0 sp=sumalt(k=0,(-1)^k*fsa(k,x)) sn=sumalt(k=0,(-1)^k*gsa(k,x)) sp+sn-x  \\ check for sequence of solutions for central values in steps of 1 iteration vsumaltp=vectorv(n,r,[x=f(1,r-1),sp=sumalt(k=0,(-1)^k*fsa(k,x)),sn=sumalt(k=0,(-1)^k*gsa(k,x)),sp+sn-x]) vsumaltn=vectorv(n,r,[x=f(1,1-r),sp=sumalt(k=0,(-1)^k*fsa(k,x)),sn=sumalt(k=0,(-1)^k*gsa(k,x)),sp+sn-x]) Mat(vsumaltp) \\ list as documented , central values towards f(x,+inf) Mat(vsumaltn) \\                      central values towards f(x,-inf)",,"['limits', 'sequences-and-series']"

QUESTION: Can anyone find the function $f$ in closed form? I’m not interested in integral or series representations.

For this purpose, we may apply the mathematical induction. However,in fact,by setting up the characteristic equation $x^2-4x+2=0$ ，we may confirm that the equality above of $a_n$ really gives the general term formula of the recursion sequence as follows $$a_1=2,a_2=12,a_{n+2}=4a_{n+1}-2a_{n}(n=1,2,\cdots).$$ Now, it's clear that $a_n$ are a series of integers. Moreover, notice that $0<(2-\sqrt{2})^n<1.$ We can obtain $\{(2+\sqrt{2})^n\}=1-(2-\sqrt{2})^n.$ Thus, the problem is to ask us to find the largest $n \in \mathbb{N_+}$ such that $$\left(\frac{2+\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^n<8.$$ But the left side increases with the increasing $n$ . Hence, we only need to test the critical value.

84,Looking for stationary points of the nonlinear recurrence $x = {\rm e}^{\jmath \alpha x}$,Looking for stationary points of the nonlinear recurrence,x = {\rm e}^{\jmath \alpha x},"A while ago I stumbled upon an interesting recurrence of the form $$x_{n+1} = {\rm e}^{\jmath \cdot \alpha \cdot x_n}.$$ I studied it for positive, real-valued $\alpha$ though one could look also at complex values. I noticed that for a range of $\alpha$, this recurrence seems to have one stationary point. Trivially, for $\alpha=0$ it is $x_\infty = 1$ but I am more interested to compute it for other values of $\alpha$. I couldn't find anything helpful analytically (there is a lot on linear recurrence relations but I didn't find anything helpful on nonlinear ones). Therefore, I continued to study it numerically. Here is what I found: For $0 \leq \alpha \lessapprox 1.96$ there seems to be a single stationary point. Here is a plot of the numerical values I found, displaying $\Re(x_\infty)$ and $\Im(x_\infty)$ for various values of $\alpha$. For each $\alpha$ the sequence seems to converge to the fixed point regardless of the initialization $x_0$, but I'm not sure of it. The problem when you check this numerically is that some very large values can occur. E.g., for $\alpha = \pi/2$ and $x_0 = 3-7j$ we have: \begin{align}   x_1 & = \exp[7\pi/2]\cdot \exp[\jmath 3\pi/2] = \exp[7\pi/2]\cdot(-\jmath)  \approx - 59610\jmath \\  x_2 & = \exp[-\jmath \pi/2\cdot \jmath \cdot \exp(\jmath 7\pi/2)] =\exp[\exp(7\pi/2)] \approx {\rm e}^{59610} \\  x_3 & = \exp[\jmath \pi/2 \exp(\exp[7\pi/2])] = \exp[\jmath \varphi] \end{align} where $\varphi$ (modulo $2\pi$) is not very easy to compute but $x_3$ is small, since $|x_3|=1$. From this point on it converges. If you try to plot this numerically, you will get fractal-looking shapes like these: Here, the blue color indicates the points where $x_n$ became to large to fit into my float data type (i.e., I got INF) which could mean either divergence or just numerical problems like the one I explained above. The other colors indicate convergence after $n$ iterations, defined as getting within a radius of 0.001 of the single stationary point found earlier. For $\alpha>1.962$, the sequence seems to form limit cycles of a discrete number of points but these are even harder to predict and seem somewhat chaotic. Now here are my questions: Is it possible to compute $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} x_n$ analytically? The recurrence seems to be a quite generic one, does it have a name under which I could search further? Is anything known on the convergence? Does it have a nontrivial region of convergence and is it possibly really fractal? Or are the fractal looking images merely an artifact of my limited data type?","A while ago I stumbled upon an interesting recurrence of the form $$x_{n+1} = {\rm e}^{\jmath \cdot \alpha \cdot x_n}.$$ I studied it for positive, real-valued $\alpha$ though one could look also at complex values. I noticed that for a range of $\alpha$, this recurrence seems to have one stationary point. Trivially, for $\alpha=0$ it is $x_\infty = 1$ but I am more interested to compute it for other values of $\alpha$. I couldn't find anything helpful analytically (there is a lot on linear recurrence relations but I didn't find anything helpful on nonlinear ones). Therefore, I continued to study it numerically. Here is what I found: For $0 \leq \alpha \lessapprox 1.96$ there seems to be a single stationary point. Here is a plot of the numerical values I found, displaying $\Re(x_\infty)$ and $\Im(x_\infty)$ for various values of $\alpha$. For each $\alpha$ the sequence seems to converge to the fixed point regardless of the initialization $x_0$, but I'm not sure of it.

For a given $ m \in \mathbb{N} $, let $ F_m = \left\{ f_{a, b} : m \in f\left(\mathbb{Z}^+\right) \wedge f^{-1}(m) > 2\right\} $, i.e. the set of sequences that contain a term whose value is $ m $ such that that term is not either of the first two in the sequence. There are exactly $ m - \left\lceil \frac{m}{2}\right\rceil $ elements in $ F_m $, as the term preceding $ m $ lies in $ I_m=\left[\left\lceil \frac{m}{2}\right\rceil, m\right) $. Because $ f_{a, b} $ is uniquely determined by any two consecutive terms, we can define a new function $ g_m $ such that $ g_m(n) $ is the unique sequence $ f_{a_{m, n}, b_{m, n}} $ containing consecutive terms $ n $ and $ m $. This is well defined only for $ n \in I_m $. Prove that there exists integer $ x_m \in I_m $ such that $ g_m $ is decreasing on $ \left[\left\lceil \frac{m}{2}\right\rceil, x\right] $ and increasing on $ [x, m) $. For example, consider the case $ m = 8 $. The four sequences in $ F_8 $ are $$g_8(4) = f_{4, 4} > g_8(5) =  f_{1, 1} < g_8(6) = f_{2, 2} < g_8(7) = f_{1, 7}, $$ and $ x_8 = 5 $.

99,Proof for a summation-procedure using the matrix of Eulerian numbers?,Proof for a summation-procedure using the matrix of Eulerian numbers?,,"I've discussed a procedure for divergent summation using the matrix of Eulerian numbers occasionally in the last years (initially here , and here in MSE and MO but not in that generality and thus(?) without conclusive answers)); now I would like to formalize/make waterproof one heuristic. Consider some (divergent) series $S = K + a + b + c + d + \dots $ . To assign a finite sum to it I'm trying to use the matrix of the Eulerian numbers (let's call it Eulermatrix for now) to do something in the spirit of Abel- or possibly(?) Borel-summation: I define the function $$f(x) = K + ax + bx^2 + cx^3 + dx^4 + \dots $$ with the goal to arrive at a valid/meaningful result for the case that $x \to 1$ . The use of the Eulermatrix (see end of the post) implies then the introduction of a transform of $f(x)$ in the form $$ g(x) = K + ax + bx^2/2! + cx^3/3! + dx^4/4! + \dots  $$ If I now evaluate the sequence of partial sums according to the decomposition of the Eulerian numbers in combination with the reciprocal factorials I arrive at the form $$ s_n(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (-1)^k ((n-k)x) ^k {g^{(k)}((n-k)x) \over k!} \qquad n=1 \dots \infty \tag1$$ and if this converges to a finite value then I assume this as the (divergent) sum of the series and assume $$S = \lim _{n \to \infty} s_n(1)$$ I get meaningful results for series which have growth rates like geometric series with $q \lt 1$ and I think that the formalism of conversion into a double-sum and changing order of evaluation using the Eulermatrix gives also the range for $q$ as $- \infty \lt q \lt 1$ (because the $g(x)$ function is then entire). I can even evaluate the classical series $0! - 1! + 2! - 3! + \ldots - $ to which already L. Euler assigned the value of about $0.596...$ which is now called Gompertz constant . So I'm confident, that my general reasoning using the Eulermatrix is valid. But now: what I'm asking here is about the expression for $s_n(x)$ which reminds me of the Maclaurin-expression (which expresses a function by its derivatives at zero), but which I've not seen yet.
