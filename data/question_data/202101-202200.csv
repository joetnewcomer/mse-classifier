2,Question on Reeb's theorem.,Question on Reeb's theorem.,,"I am reading through the first couple of chapters of Milnor's Morse theory, and I've gotten to Reeb's sphere theorem (theorem 4.1), If $M$ is a compact manifold and $f$ is a differentiable function on $M$ with only two critical points, both of which are nondegenerate, then $M$ is homeomorphic to a sphere.

But I don't quite follow this. I've read other related posts, but none of them quite flesh out why we need a ""small enough"" $\varepsilon$ , or why exactly the Morse lemma implies that the aforementioned preimages are closed $n$ -cells.

Now if we have that $\mathcal{F_1}\pitchfork \mathcal{F}_2$ , we define $\mathcal{F}_1\cap \mathcal{F}_2$ to be the foliation where the leaves are the connected components of $L^{(1)}\cap L^{(2)}$ . Now we want to check that is a foliation with codimension the sum of the codimensions of $\mathcal{F}_1$ and $\mathcal{F}_2$ .

Now note that the way we gave the manifold structure to $L^{(1)}$ was that the topology was generated by the plaques $L^{(1)}\cap U'$ where $U'$ was a foliated chart for $p$ , and the coordinate chart was the restriction of the foliated chart to the non-constant components. So we have the $(x_1,...,x_k)$ are associated with a chart of $M$ , $(x^1,...,x^k,y^1,...,y^{d-k})$ such that the connected components of $L^{(1)}\cap U'$ are of the form $\{p\in U' : y^1(p)=ct,...,y^{d-k}(p)=ct\}$ .

Since $H \equiv 0$ implies $k_1=-k_2$ , where $k_1,k_2$ are principal curvature and we assume $k_1\geq k_2$ , we get $K=-k_1^2<0$ , so $\tilde{g}=-Kg$ is a conformal change indeed.

In particular I don't quite understand what exactly is meant by the terms $f'(x)v_i$ . I suppose these vectors are supposed to be the new inputs for the resulting $k$ -Form over $U$ . Let me showcase my confusion with the help of an example. Let $\omega = xdx + ydy + zdz$ and $f:[0,2\pi]\to\mathbb{R}^3$ is the curve $f(t) = (e^{t\sin{t}},t^2 - 2\pi t, \cos{\frac{t}{2}})$ . Then we have $f'(t) = ((\sin{t} + t\cos{t})e^{t\sin{t}}, 2t - 2\pi, -\frac{1}{2}\sin{\frac{t}{2}})$ and the above definition should reduce to: $$ (f^{*}\omega)(t)[v] = \omega(f(t))[f'(x)v] $$ where $v = (x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3$ .

24,Initial value problem with null surface data,Initial value problem with null surface data,,"Let $(M,g)$ be a $d$ -dimensional Lorentzian manifold, i.e., the metric tensor $g$ has signature $(-1,+1,\dots,+1)$ where $-1$ appears only once and $+1$ appears $(d-1)$ times. A null hypersurface $\Sigma\subset M$ is one codimension one embedded submanifold whose normal vector $n$ is null, i.e., $$g(n,n)=0.$$ On the other hand a spacelike hypersurface $\Sigma\subset M$ is one codimension one embedded submanifold whose normal vector $n$ is timelike, $$g(n,n)<0.$$ Now, further suppose that $\Sigma$ is globally hyperbolic so that a Cauchy surface can be defined and an initial value problem can be defined. In that sense, there is a theorem stating what is the appropriate initial value on a spacelike hypersurface. This is presented in Wald's General Relativity as: Theorem 10.1.2: Let $(M,g)$ be a globally hyperbolic spacetime (or a globally hyperbolic region of an arbitrary spacetime) and let $\nabla$ be any derivative operator. Let $\Sigma$ be a smooth, spacelike Cauchy surface. Consider the system of $n$ linear equations for $n$ unknown functions $\phi_1,\dots \phi_n$ of the form $$g^{ab}\nabla_a\nabla_b\phi_i + \sum_j (A_{ij})^a\nabla_a \phi_j + \sum_j B_{ij}\phi_j + C_i = 0\tag{10.1.20}.$$ Then equation (10.1.20) has a well posed initial value formulation on $\Sigma$ . More precisely, given arbitrary smooth initial data, $(\phi_i,n^a\nabla_a \phi_i)$ for $i=1,\dots,n$ on $\Sigma$ there exists a unique solution of equation (10.1.20) throughout $M$ . Furthermore, the solutions depend continuously on the initial data in the sense described above for the Klein-Gordon equation in flat spacetime. Finally a variation of the initial data outside of a closed subset, $S$ , of $\Sigma$ does not affect the solution in $D(S)$ [the domain of dependence]. This tells that given appropriate initial value on a spacelike Cauchy surface, namely, the value of the fields and their first derivatives along the normal, we are granted a unique solution. This paper alludes to such a result when $\Sigma$ is a null surface, but: (1) it just talks about a single scalar field, (2) it never precisely states a theorem and (3) it is not much rigorous really. The claim is on page 14: We emphasize that the initial value data needed for the null surface development consists of the function on a pair of null surfaces ; it is not the same as the data needed in the standard Cauchy problem, which is the function and its first time derivative on an initial surface [14], [15]. I've tried skimming through the papers [14] and [15] mentioned there, but they never even mention null/lightlike surfaces, so if the result is there it is probably phrased differently and I wasn't able to identify it. My question : is there one analogue theorem of Theorem (10.1.2) for null surfaces ? In other words, a theorem stating what is the appropriate initial value data to be specified on null surfaces to find a unique solution of an equation like (10.1.20)? My particular interest would be in null infinity $\mathscr{I}^\pm$ defined in the Penrose completion of an asymptotically flat spacetime, but I believe such theorem would just care about the surface being null.

49,Simple question on parallel transport in dually flat manifolds,Simple question on parallel transport in dually flat manifolds,,"I just started studying Information Geometry and its applications by Amari . Right in the first chapter, the author talks about parallel transport in Dually flat manifolds. Just some quick notation:  In the first chapter, the author introduces the definition of Manifold $M$ and one of the many coordinate systems on the manifold, say, $\theta$ . The length of the curve from $\boldsymbol {\theta}$ to $\boldsymbol{ \theta + d\theta}$ is given by $$ d s^{2}=2 D_{\psi}[\theta : \theta+d \theta]=\sum g_{i j} d \theta^{i} d \theta^{j} $$ A tangent vector can be expressed as $$ d \boldsymbol{\theta}=\sum d \theta^{i} \boldsymbol{e}_{i} $$ where $ \left\{\boldsymbol{e}_{i}\right\} $ , $i \in \{1,.. ,n\}$ are the basis of the tangent space of M at point $\boldsymbol \theta$ . Similarly, the author introduces a dual affine coordinate system whose corresponding basis is $\left\{e^{* i}\right\}$ . Therefore,we can write $$ d \boldsymbol \theta^{*}=\sum d \theta_{i}^{*} e^{* i} $$ Now, one can also write the length of the small line vector as $$ d s^{2}=\langle d \boldsymbol{\theta}, d \boldsymbol{\theta}\rangle= g_{i j} d \theta^{i} d \theta^{j} $$ , which is rewritten as $$ d s^{2}=\left\langle d \theta^{i} e_{i}, d \theta^{j} e_{j}\right\rangle=\left\langle e_{i}, e_{j}\right\rangle d \theta^{i} d \theta^{j} $$ Hence, it is clear that $$ g_{i j}(\boldsymbol{\theta})=\left\langle\boldsymbol{e}_{i}, \boldsymbol{e}_{j}\right\rangle $$ Similarly, for the dual affine coordinate system $\boldsymbol \theta^*$ , we have $$ g^{* i j}(\boldsymbol \theta^*)=\left\langle e^{* i}, e^{* j}\right\rangle $$ If $\bf G$ is the Jacobian of the transformation from $\boldsymbol \theta$ to $\boldsymbol \theta^*$ , then we can write $$ \begin{array}{l}{d \boldsymbol{\theta}^{*}=\mathbf{G} d \boldsymbol{\theta}, \quad d \boldsymbol{\theta}=\mathbf{G}^{-1} d \boldsymbol{\theta}^{*}} \\ {d \theta_{i}^{*}=g_{i j} d \theta^{j}, \quad d \theta^{j}=g^{* j i} d \theta_{i}^{*}}\end{array} $$ Actual doubt: If a tangent vector $\mathbf{A} = A^i\mathbf{e_i} $ is transported   from a point $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ to $\boldsymbol{\theta^{'}}$ , the   components $A^i$ remain the same because $\mathbf{e_i}$ is same   everywhere in a dually flat manifold. However, in the later   paragraphs, it is stated that the length of the vector is not constant   even in this dually flat manifold. If the components and basis remain   the same, shouldn't it be the case where even the length of the vector   is also the same when moved from one point to another point? Also, why is dual parallel transport any different parallel transport?   After all, they are just two different coordinate systems. Because, it   is given that the manifold is dually flat, so both the coordinate   systems remain the same across all the points. So, why does the   parallel transport makes the vector invariant under the original basis   but the same parallel transport changes the vector in the dual basis?

But I'm having a hard time trying to write out each components explicitly. I would love some helps!! P.S.

We say $A$ is symmetric-compatible with $\nabla$ if for every $X,Y \in \Gamma(TM)$ $$ A([X,Y])=\nabla_X^E \big(A(Y)\big) - \nabla_Y^E \big(A(X)\big). \tag{1} $$ Here is the basic example: Let $N$ be a manifold, and let $\nabla^{TN}$ be any symmetric connection on $TN$. Suppose $f:M \to N$ is a smooth map. Take $E=f^*{TN}$, $A=df$. Then, indeed $$ df([X,Y])= \nabla^{f^*TN}_X df(Y) -  \nabla^{f^*TN}_Y df(X). $$ Question: Fix a bundle $E$. Does every connection $\nabla$ on $E$ admit a non-zero symmetric-compatible operator? What are the possible dimensions of the vector space $$\{ A \in \operatorname{Hom(TM,E)} \,|\, \text{ is symmetric-compatible with $\nabla$} \}?$$ Can it be zero? Can it be infinite? I tried to write condition $(1)$ locally in coordinates. Is this notion has been studied? Are there any other ""natural"" examples besides the one I described above? I am mostly interested in the case where the rank of $E$ equals $\dim M$. Edit: The first reasonable thing to do is to understand the local version of the problem: Suppose $\operatorname{rank}(E)=\dim M=d$: Let $U\subset M$ be a neighborhood on which $M$ and $E$ are trivial. Let $x_1,\ldots,x_d$ be coordinates on $U$, and let $e_1,\ldots,e_d$ be a frame of $E$ on $U$. Let $\Gamma_{ij}^k$ represent the connection $\nabla$ on $U$. That is, $$\nabla_ie_j=\Gamma_{ij}^ke_k.$$ For the bundle morphism $A$, write $$A\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right)=A_i^ke_k.$$ So, $$\nabla_iA\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^j}\right)=\nabla_iA_j^ke_k=\frac{\partial A_j^k}{\partial x^i}e_k+A_j^k\Gamma_{ik}^le_l=\left(\frac{\partial A_j^l}{\partial x^i}+A_j^k\Gamma_{ik}^l\right)e_l.$$ Finally, $A$ is symmetric compatible with $\nabla$ if and only if the equality $$\frac{\partial A_j^l}{\partial x^i}+A_j^k\Gamma_{ik}^l=\frac{\partial A_i^l}{\partial x^j}+A_i^k\Gamma_{jk}^l$$ holds for every $1\leq i<j\leq d$ and $1\leq l\leq d$. (Since it is enough to verify condition $(1)$ on different pairs of coordinate fields, as observed by Amitai Yuval). In general this is a system of $\frac{d^2(d-1)}{2}$ scalar equations. Let us consider the first non-trivial case: $d=2$: In that case the only surviving pair is $(i,j)=(1,2)$: $$l=1: \, \,\frac{\partial A_2^1}{\partial x^1}+A_2^1\Gamma_{11}^1+A_2^2\Gamma_{12}^1=\frac{\partial A_1^1}{\partial x^2}+A_1^1\Gamma_{21}^1+A_1^2\Gamma_{22}^1,$$ and $$l=2: \frac{\partial A_2^2}{\partial x^1}+A_2^1\Gamma_{11}^2+A_2^2\Gamma_{12}^2=\frac{\partial A_1^2}{\partial x^2}+A_1^1\Gamma_{21}^2+A_1^2\Gamma_{22}^2$$ I still need to think how many degrees of freedom do we have for this system?

96,Geodesics on Cylinders,Geodesics on Cylinders,,"I have a question about Geodesics on Cylinders and think I have the right answer but am unsure. The question reads: Let $C_r:=[(x,y,z)\in\mathbb{R}^3: x^2+y^2=r]$ be the infinite cylinder of radius $r$. Show that $C_{r_1}$ is isometric to $C_{r_2}$ iff $r_1=r_2$. Now I understand the logic behind this question I think. An isometry preserves geodesics, and because if you intersect a plane parallel to the axis of the cylinder with this cylinder, you get a curve $C$, which is just a circle, that is a geodesic. Now, if the radius between the two cylinders are different, the smaller circle would lie inside of the bigger cylinder, thus not lying on the surface and definitely not a geodesic. Is this okay to write? Or do I have to explain it mathematically?","I have a question about Geodesics on Cylinders and think I have the right answer but am unsure.

The parametrization is given as: $$T(\varphi, \theta) = ((R+r\cos(\theta))\cos(\varphi), (R+r\cos(\theta))\sin(\varphi), r\sin(\theta))$$ Now I computed the Geodesic Curvature of $\theta=\text{constant}, \varphi = \text{constant}$, which both gave $0$. I am told to integrate on three surfaces. a) The Torus b)The portion of the Torus bounded by $\theta\in[\frac{-\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]$ c)The portion of the Torus bounded by $\varphi\in[\frac{-\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]$ Now for a), I used the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem, assuming that $\kappa_G=0$ based on the Geodesic Curvatures giving zero. Then, I concluded: $$\int_T K\cdot dA = 2\pi\chi(T)$$ The Euler Characteristic of the Torus is $0$, thus I concluded that the integral of $K\cdot dA=0$ on the torus.

98,Definition of flows on manifolds,Definition of flows on manifolds,,"I'm currently studying Differential Geometry with the book Introduction to Smooth Manifolds by Lee and got confused by the following definition of a flow: A global flow $\theta$ on a smooth manifold $M$ is a continuous map $\theta:\mathbb{R}\times M\rightarrow M$ satisfying the following properties for all $s,t\in\mathbb{R}$ and $p\in M$ : (1) $\theta(t,\theta(s,p))=\theta(t+s,p)$ (2) $\theta(0,p)=p$ For specific subsets of $\mathbb{R}\times M$ we can also define a local flow with the same properties but some additional technicalities (usually if the time-domain cannot be the whole real axis). We know that every smooth vector field induces a unique maximal local flow (i.e. with a maximal time-domain). Now to the problem: For $M=\mathbb{R}$ and the vector field $V=x^2\frac{\partial}{\partial x}$ we get the (local) flow $\theta(t,p)=\frac{p}{1-t}$ by solving the ODE $\dot{x}=x^2$ with initial value $x(0)=p$ . However, $\theta(t,\theta(s,p))=\frac{p}{1-s}\frac{1}{1-t}\neq\theta(t+s,p)$ so (2) is not fulfilled and $\theta(t,p)$ is not a flow - although it is the solution of the corresponding ODE...
