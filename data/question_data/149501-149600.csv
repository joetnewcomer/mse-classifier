1,Question on Inductive Proof of Implicit Function Theorem,Question on Inductive Proof of Implicit Function Theorem,,"I am struggling with an inductive proof of the implicit function theorem, concretely with the final part of construction of a function, up to this final point everything is perfectly clear to me. First the following is known to be true: Theorem 1: Let $F : G \subseteq \mathbb R^{n+1} \to \mathbb R$, $G \ne \emptyset$, $F \in C^1(G)$, $G$ open. For $x^0 \in \mathbb R^n, y^0 \in \mathbb R$ let $$  F(x^0, y^0) = 0 \quad \mbox{ and } \quad  F_y(x^0, y^0) \ne 0. $$ Then there exists some neighborhood $U(x^0) \subseteq \mathbb R^n$ and a function $f : U(x^0) \to \mathbb R$ such that  $$  y = f(x_1, \ldots, x_n), \qquad  y_0 = f(x_1^0, \ldots, x_n^0) $$ and $$  F(x, f(x)) = 0 $$ and $f \in C^1(U(x^0))$. Now the Implicit Function Theorem reads as Theorem 2 (Implicit Function Theorem): Let $F : G \subseteq \mathbb R^{n+m} \to \mathbb R^m$, $G\ne \emptyset$, $F \in C^1(G)$, $G$ open. Also $(x^0, y^0) \in G$ with $x^0 \in \mathbb R^n, y^0 \in \mathbb R^m, F(x^0,y^0) = 0$ and $$  \det\left( \frac{\partial F}{\partial y} \right)_{y=y_0} \ne 0. $$ Then there exists neighborhoods $U(x^0) \subseteq \mathbb R^n, V(y^0) \subseteq \mathbb R^m$ and a function $g : U(x^0) \to V(x^0)$ such that $F(x, g(x)) = 0$ on $x \in U(x^0)$. Proof: The proof proceeds by induction on $m$, if $m = 1$ it is Theorem 1, so we assume $m > 1$ and suppose (by induction hypothesis) the statement holds for $m-1$. Let $F : G \subseteq \mathbb R^{n+m} \to \mathbb R^n$ be given, then because of $$  \det\left( \frac{\partial F}{\partial y} \right)_{y=y_0} \ne 0  \quad \mbox{ or } \quad \det \begin{pmatrix}   \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial y_1} & \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial y_2} & \cdots & \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial y_m} \\   \vdots \\   \frac{\partial F_m}{\partial y_1} & \frac{\partial F_m}{\partial y_2} & \cdots & \frac{\partial F_m}{\partial y_m}   \end{pmatrix} \ne 0. $$ So we can suppose that every row contains an entry $\ne 0$, suppose w.l.o.g. that  $\frac{\partial F_m}{\partial y_m} \ne 0$. By Theorem 1 we can solve (locally) for $y_m$, that means there is some neighborhood $U$ of $(x, y_1, \ldots, y_{m-1})$ and a function $$  y_m = \varphi(x, y_1, \ldots, y_{m-1}) $$ and $\varphi$ is continously differentiable with ($x \in \mathbb R^n$) $$  F_m(x, y_1, \ldots, y_{m-1}, \varphi(x, y_1, \ldots, y_{m-1})) = 0 $$ for all $(x,y_1,\ldots,y_{m-1}) \in U$. Now set  $$  \Phi_i(x, y_1, \ldots, y_{m-1}) := F_i(x, y_1, \ldots, y_{m-1}, \varphi(x, y_1, \ldots, y_{m-1})) $$ for $i = 1, \ldots, m-1$. Then $\Phi : U \subseteq \mathbb R^{n+m-1} \to \mathbb R^{m-1}$ and $\Phi$ fulfills als prerequisites to apply the induction hypothesis (here the proof shows this, but I omit it because it is quite long and does not apply to my question). Then there exists neighborhoods $W \subseteq \mathbb R^n, V \subseteq \mathbb R^{m-1}$ and a function $g : W \to V$ with $$  \Phi(x, g(x)) = 0 $$ for all $x \in W$. Now set $h(x) = (g(x), \varphi(x,g(x))$, then we have $$  F(x, h(x)) = 0 $$ and the proof is finished. $\square$ My question is on the last part. Namely the construction of the function $h(x)$, 1) Because $h(x) = (g(x), \varphi(x, g(x))$ it must be the case that $(x, g(x) \in U$, because $\varphi : U \to \mathbb R$, but I do not see that this must be the case? 2) The same issue if I want to show that $F(x, h(x)) = 0$, if $i \ne m$ it is $$  F_i(x, h(x)) = \Phi_i(x, g(x)) $$ by definition, but for $$  F_m(x, h(x)) = F_m(x, g(x), \varphi(x,g(x)) = F_m(x, g_1(x), \ldots, g_{m-1}(x), \varphi(x, g_1(x), \ldots, g_{m-1}(x)) $$ and to conclude that this equals $0$ it also must be that $(x, g(x)) \in U$, but I do not see that this must be the case?","I am struggling with an inductive proof of the implicit function theorem, concretely with the final part of construction of a function, up to this final point everything is perfectly clear to me.

That means that I want to show that if both $f$ and $\mathcal{F}(f)$ are compactly supported, $f = 0$. I've seem some questions like this here, but I believe this is not duplicate. That because on those questions I've seem people using the Fourier series , while here I'm talking about the Fourier transform. In the Fourier series we require $f$ to be periodic. Here $f$ needs not to be periodic. In that case, I can't restrict $f$ to $[-\pi,\pi]$ and talk about its Fourier series, because it need not be the case that $f(-\pi)=f(\pi)$, since $f$ is arbitrary. Now, if $f$ is compactly supported, there's an interval $[a,b]$ such that $f(x) = 0$ for all $x\notin [a,b]$. If $\mathcal{F}(f)$ also is compactly supported there's $[c,d]$ such that $\mathcal{F}(f)(\xi)=0$ if $\xi\notin [c,d]$.
