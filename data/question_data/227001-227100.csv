5,Why does the intersection of prime ideals uniquely determine the prime ideals?,Why does the intersection of prime ideals uniquely determine the prime ideals?,,"For context, I'm going through an introductory course in algebraic geometry. The course is such that it doesn't assume any commutative algebra knowledge so many results are taken on belief, but on the other hand we spend some time proving small results to get a feel for things. Claim: Let $P_1, \ldots, P_k$ be prime ideals where $i \neq j \implies P_i \nsubseteq P_j$ . A finite intersection of prime ideals $I = \bigcap \limits^k_{i=1} P_i$ uniquely determines the set of prime ideals $\{P_1, \ldots, P_k\}$ which $I$ is an intersection of. Attempt: The key idea is to use prime avoidance lemma, but I have no clue how it is applied here. It is supposed to be used as follows. Say we have another way to write the intersection with some other prime ideals: $I = \bigcap\limits^l_{i=1}Q_i$ . We see that $\bigcap \limits^l_{i=1}Q_i \subseteq P_1$ , so supposedly now prime avoidance lemma implies that there exists $Q_j$ such that $Q_j \subseteq P_1$ . Buying this result, the claim follows easily, but I cannot for the life of me prove this by using prime avoidance lemma. I think that a way to show this without using the prime avoidance lemma is by noticing that $Q_1\cdots Q_l \subseteq \bigcap\limits^l_{i=1}Q_i \subseteq P_1$ .

One can easily show that $s_{1,x},\dots,s_{n,x}$ generate $\mathcal{F}_{x}$ for all $x\in V\subset U$ . In particular we obtain a surjective morphism \begin{equation*}\phi:\mathcal{O}^n_{|V}\to\mathcal{F}_{|V} \end{equation*} But $\mathcal{F}$ is coherent so the kernel of such morphism is finitely generated and it is zero over $x_0$ ( I mean the stalk of the sheaf kernel is zero at $x_0$ ).

31,Classification of degree 3 rational maps on a hyperelliptic curve,Classification of degree 3 rational maps on a hyperelliptic curve,,"It's amazing how far in life you can get with theorems, without stopping to do any calculations. Let $\Sigma_2$ be a genus $2$ curve embedded in the projective plane given by the equation $z^4 y^2 = \prod_{i=1}^6 (x - z \zeta_i)$ in homogenous coordinates, with the $\zeta_i$ of course being the fixed points of the hyperelliptic involution. I want to understand what the possible degree $3$ rational maps are from $\Sigma_2$ to $\mathbb{CP}^1$ . Since the maps I'm interested in are rational maps, we just work in affine coordinates. This is convenient because as written, such a curve is singular at $[0:1:0]$ in the projective plane, and I don't want to have to compute the normalization. Now this reduces the problem to fidning when $[\mathbb{C}(x,y):f^\ast(\mathbb{C}(t))] = 3$ where $t$ is the local coordinate on $\mathbb{C}$ , and $x,y$ satisfy $y^2 = \prod(x-\zeta_i)$ . Prima facie this happens in two ways. By finding a degree $1$ map from $\Sigma_2 \to \mathbb{CP}^1$ and composing with a degree $3$ map from the sphere to itself, and by finding a genuine degree $3$ map. The former isn't possible though, since a degree $1$ map would be an isomorphism. Such a map is of course defined by what it does to $t$ . So I send $t \mapsto F(x,y)$ . Is there a strategy for computing the degree? Somehow I have made it this far in my life and only seen trivial examples, where the fields in question are things like $\mathbb{Q}(\text{radicals and stuff})$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ . In an attempt to figure this out, I noticed that I can write this as $F(x,y) = \frac{P(x,y)}{Q(x,y)}$ , and then $P,Q$ can be written as polynomials in $y$ , i.e. $P(x) = P_1(x) + yP_2(x)$ using the equation of the curve. Now the degree of $F$ is the difference of the degrees of $P$ and $Q$ , so I just need to compute these degrees. I believe that the degree of $y$ is $6$ (after being enlightened in the comments) since a generic choice of $y$ , we will obtain a polynomial of degree $6$ , having $6$ solutions. and the degree of $P_1, Q_1$ should be simply their degrees as polynomials in $x$ .

I can't find a mistake in my dissertation, however I arrive to an absurd conclusion. Would somebody agree to read the following and tell me where I assumed something impossible / concluded something wrong ? Let $G$ be a connected reductive group over an algebraically closed field. Fix $T_0$ a maximal torus, and denote by $W_0:=W(T_0)=N_G(T_0)/T_0$ the associated Weyl group. Assume that there exists an element $w_0\in W_0$ of order $2$ which is not in the center of $W_0$ . Let $n_0\in N_G(T_0)$ be a representative of $w_0$ , and consider $\phi:G\xrightarrow{\sim} G$ the conjugation-by- $n_0$ automorphism. Naturally, the torus $T_0$ is $\phi$ -stable, and $\phi$ induces the conjugation-by- $w_0$ automorphism of $W_0$ . Let me now consider another maximal torus $T=\,^gT_0$ for some $g\in G$ . Associated to it, we have another description of the Weyl group $W:=W(T)=N_G(T)/T \simeq \, ^gW_0$ . Note that we also have $N_G(T) = \, ^gN_G(T_0)$ . We make the assumption that $T$ is also $\phi$ -stable, so that $\phi$ also induces an action on $W$ naturally. It means that $g^{-1}\phi(g)$ lies in $N_G(T_0)$ , I denote this element by $\tilde{n_0}$ . Eventually, I assume that $\tilde{n_0}$ also has image $w_0$ in $W_0$ . It implies that $\tilde{n_0}n_0$ lies in $T_0$ , because $w_0$ has order $2$ . Let me now look at the action of $\phi$ on $W$ . Let me consider $\nu\in N_G(T)$ and write $\nu=g\nu_0g^{-1}$ for some $\nu_0\in N_G(T_0)$ . I have $$\begin{align} \phi(\nu)=\phi(g)\phi(\nu_0)\phi(g)^{-1} & = g\tilde{n_0}\,\phi(\nu_0)\,\tilde{n_0}^{-1}g^{-1}\\ & = g\tilde{n_0}\,n_0\nu_0n_0^{-1}\,\tilde{n_0}^{-1}g^{-1}\\ & = (g\tilde{n_0}n_0g^{-1})(g\nu_0g^{-1})(gn_0^{-1}\tilde{n_0}^{-1}g^{-1}) \end{align}$$ Because $\tilde{n_0}n_0$ lies in $T_0$ , both the first and last parentheses are in $^gT_0=T$ . Moreover, the middle parenthesis is just $\nu$ . Now, $\nu$ normalizes $T$ so we may rewrite it under the form $\nu\cdot \text{sth in }T$ . This last observation means that $\phi$ acts like $\mathrm{id}$ on $W$ . But that is absurd : if it did, it would also act as identity on $W_0$ , meaning that $w_0$ would be in the center of $W_0$ , that is a contradiction. So, where has something gone wrong in my arguments ? Edit: An example, as demanded in the comments. I consider $G=\mathrm{GL}_n$ over an algebraically closed field $k$ with $\mathrm{char}(k)\not = 2$ , and I assume that $n=2k+1$ is odd.

As a representative in $N_G(T_0)$ , I consider $n_0$ the matrix having antidiagonal filled with $1$ 's. Now, I put $$g =  \begin{bmatrix} 1 &        &       &        &        &        & 1\\   & \unicode{x22f1} &       &        &        & \unicode{x22F0} &  \\   &        & 1     &        & 1      &        &  \\   &        &       & 1      &        &        &  \\   &        & 1     &        & -1     &        &  \\   & \unicode{x22F0} &       &        &        & \unicode{x22f1} &  \\ 1 &        &       &        &        &        & -1 \end{bmatrix}  \quad  g^{-1} = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 &        &       &        &        &        & 1\\   & \unicode{x22f1} &       &        &        & \unicode{x22F0} &  \\   &        & 1     &        & 1      &        &  \\   &        &       & 2      &        &        &  \\   &        & 1     &        & -1     &        &  \\   & \unicode{x22F0} &       &        &        & \unicode{x22f1} &  \\ 1 &        &       &        &        &        & -1 \end{bmatrix}  $$ This shape is possible because $n$ is odd. The matrix $g$ is invertible because of the assumption on the characteristic. Its inverse is given by the matrix on the right. I may now compute $g^{-1}\phi(g)$ which gives me the antidiagonal matrix having coefficients, from bottom left to top right, $k$ times $-1$ and $k+1$ times $1$ . It is a generalized permutation matrix, so it lies in $N_G(T_0)$ . In means that $T:=\,^gT_0$ is stable by $\phi$ . Moreover, let us note that $\tilde{n_0}:=g^{-1}\phi(g)$ also is a representative of $w_0$ , just as in the situation I considered above. We may further compute $T$ explicitly. It is the subgroup (maximal torus) consisting of all cross-shaped invertible matrices (ie. with coefficients on the diagonals only) which are invariant under 180° rotation. Edit2: Partial answer and thoughts. I think that my mistake lies in ""if $\phi$ acts like $\mathrm{id}$ on $W$ then it must act like $\mathrm{id}$ in $W_0$ as well"". Say, generally speaking, that $\phi:G\rightarrow G$ is an endomorphism of $G$ having $T_0$ and $T:=\,^gT_0$ as two maximal $\phi$ -stable tori, so that $\tilde{n_0}:=g^{-1}\phi(g) \in N_G(T_0)$ . Assume also that $\phi$ acts like $\mathrm{id}$ on $W$ . It means precisely that $\forall \nu \in N_G(T), \;\nu^{-1}\phi(\nu)\in T$ . In terms of $T_0$ , it means that $\forall \nu_0\in N_G(T_0),\; \nu_0^{-1}\tilde{n_0}\phi(\nu_0)\tilde{n_0}^{-1}\in T_0$ . In other words, the composition of the conjugation by $\tilde{n_0}$ with $\phi$ induces the identity on $W_0$ . Thus, $\phi$ acts like conjugation by (the image of) $\tilde{n_0}^{-1}$ on $W_0$ , which may not be the identity. This is consistent with my situation above, where $\phi$ acts like conjugation by $w_0$ . The conclusion is that the action of an endomorphism on a Weyl group actually depends on the choice of the stable maximal torus ; that was unexpected for me.","While trying to understand more the structure of reductive group, I came upon the situation that I describe below.

57,Morphisms of rings that define morphisms of derivations,Morphisms of rings that define morphisms of derivations,,"I am not super experienced in (commutative) algebra and in the course of some of my work I noticed that I had a need for morphisms of rings that are compatible with the asssociated module of derivations. Let me set some notation. $ R $ and $ S $ are rings and and $ \phi \colon R \to S $ is a ring homomorphism. Let $ Der(R) $ and $Der(S)$ denote the respective modules of derivations. Since $ S $ is an $ R $ -module, we can also define $ Der(R, S ) $ to be the $R$ -module of derivations on $R$ with values in $S$ . Notice that there are natural $R$ -module homomorphisms $ Der(R) \to Der(R,S) $ and $ Der(S) \to Der(R,S) $ by post- and pre-composition by $\phi$ , respectively. There is also a natural $S$ -module homomorphism $S \otimes_R Der(R) \to Der(R,S)$ . Now let me propose two definitions. My hope is that these definitions exist in the literature and I am just too ignorant to know the actual terminology. Definition 1 : We say that $\phi$ is of the first kind if there exists a unique morphism of $R$ -modules $\alpha \colon Der(R) \to Der(S) $ which makes the following diagram commute: $$ \begin{array}{ccc} Der(R) & \rightarrow & Der(S) \\  & \searrow & \downarrow \\  & & Der(R,S) \end{array} $$ Motivating Example : Suppose $M$ is a smooth manifold and $U$ is an open subset. The restriction map $C^\infty(M) \to C^\infty(U)$ is a ring homomorphism of the first kind. I suspect this is actually true for any locally ringed space (?). Definition 2 : We say that $\phi$ is of the second kind if there exists a unique morphism of $S$ -modules $\beta \colon Der(S) \to S \otimes_R Der(R) $ which makes the following diagram commute: $$ \begin{array}{ccc} Der(S) & \rightarrow & S \otimes_R Der(R) \\  & \searrow & \downarrow \\  & & Der(R,S) \end{array} $$ Motivating Example : Suppose $M$ and $N$ are smooth compact manifolds and $f \colon M \to N $ is a smooth function. The pull-back map $f^* \colon C^\infty(N) \to C^\infty(M) $ is of the second kind. With the definitions out of the way, let me ask my questions. Question 1 : Is there a nice category of rings where every homomorphism is of the first and/or second kind? Question 2 : Are the uniqueness conditions in the definitions necessary? In my fumbling efforts I have not been able to find counter-examples. ( I have since partially answered this, see edit ) Question 3 : Are morphisms of local rings always of the second kind? Question 4 : If I assume that $Der(R)$ and $Der(S)$ are projective and finitely generated modules does that imply that $\phi$ is of the second kind? Question 5 : When is a morphism of local rings of the first/second kind? In the algebraic geometry universe, which morphisms of schemes induce homomorphisms of the first/second kind? EDIT 1 : Regarding uniqueness I see that there are plenty of examples that fail uniqueness. For instance, if one takes $M$ to be a manifold and $\pi \colon M \times M \to M $ to be projection to the first factor, one can show that there are actually many module homomorphisms $ \mathcal{X}(M \times M) \to \mathcal{X} (M)$ which make the 'first kind' diagram commute. However, none of them are natural/canonical. EDIT 2 : I figured I should include the version in terms of Kahler forms. Let's assume that $R$ and $S$ are $k$ -algebras for some fixed field $k$ . We denote by $\Omega_R$ and $\Omega_S$ the usual modules of Kahler forms. The universal property of the Kahler differential tells us that $$ Der(R) \cong Hom_R(\Omega_R,R) \quad Der(S) \cong Hom(\Omega_S,S) \quad Der(R,S) \cong Hom_R(\Omega_R, S) $$ One can use these isomorphisms to substitute these objects into the above diagrams. The one glimmer of hope is that there is actually a natural homomorphism $\phi_* \colon \Omega_R \to \Omega_S$ obtained by the rule $ \phi_*(dr) = d(\phi(r))$ . Still, this is not enough to get the maps. From this point of view, it seems likely that if one assumes that $\Omega_R$ and $\Omega_S$ are sufficiently nice modules, then $\phi$ will be of the first/second kind. It seems like it could also be related to the structure of $S$ as an $R$ -module. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to show that these conditions suffice. I also have no intuition as to which sorts of rings will have projective/finitely generated/etc modules of Kahler forms.","I am not super experienced in (commutative) algebra and in the course of some of my work I noticed that I had a need for morphisms of rings that are compatible with the asssociated module of derivations.

There is also a natural -module homomorphism . Now let me propose two definitions. My hope is that these definitions exist in the literature and I am just too ignorant to know the actual terminology.

The restriction map is a ring homomorphism of the first kind. I suspect this is actually true for any locally ringed space (?).

This is Lemma 5.2.3, for reference. If $\mathcal{A}_X^{p,q}$ denotes the sheaf of smooth $(p,q)-$ forms on a compact Kähler manifold $X$ , then the Hodge star operator $$ \star:\mathcal{A}^{p,q}_X\to\mathcal{A}_X^{n-p,n-q}$$ is defined using the pairing $\mathcal{A}^{p,q}_X\otimes \mathcal{A}^{n-p,n-q}_X\to \Bbb{C}$ coming from pairing to the volume form and integrating. If $\pi:E\to X$ is a Hermitian holomorphic vector bundle, we can define a new Hodge star $\star_E$ similarly by $$ \star_E:\mathcal{A}_X^{p,q}(E)\to \mathcal{A}_X^{n-p,n-q}(E^*)$$ by sending $\omega\otimes s\mapsto \star\omega\otimes s^*$ where $s^*$ is defined using the Hermitian metric.

I mean for holomorphic map $F:X\to Y$ between Riemann Surfaces, we have $$\chi(X)=d(F)\cdot\chi(Y)-R_F$$ with $\chi(X)$ is the Euler characteristic and $d(F)$ is the degree of $F$ and $R_F=\sum_{p \in X} (e_p(F)-1)$ . This result is proved in three steps: First, we prove the set of ramification points is finite (easy), so $R_F$ is a finite sum. And we take a triangulation of $Y$ , such that each branch point of $F$ is a vertex. I don't understand this, is this because any triangle is triangulated? I want to prove it formally. Step 2: Assume there are $v_Y$ vertices, $e_Y$ edges, and $t_Y$ triangles. Lift this triangulation to $X$ via the map $F$ (how we can do it?), and there are $v_X$ (resp. $e_X , t_X$ ) vertices (resp. edges, triangles) on $X$ . Since there are no ramification points over the general point of any triangle, each triangle of $Y$ lift to $\deg(F)$ triangle in $X$ (why, really two days to understand that and I can't).

The number of preimages of $q$ in $X$ is $F^{-1}(q)$ , which we can rewrite $$|F^{-1}(q)|=d(F)+\sum_{p\in F^{-1}(q)}1-e_p (F).$$ Therefore the total number of preimages of vertices of $Y$ , which is the number $v_X$ is $$v_X = \sum_{vertex \ q \ of \ Y}(d(F)+\sum_{p\in F^{-1}(q)}1-e_p (F))=d(F)\cdot v_Y - \sum_{vertex \ q\ of \ Y}\sum_{p \in F^{-1}(q)}e_p(F)-1)\\ = d(F)\cdot v_Y - \sum_{vertex \ p \ of \ X}e_p(F)-1$$ Also, I think the last inequality is true because the set of vertex $p$ of $X$ is the set of preimages of $q$ vertex in $Y$ .

In the proof of Theorem 6 on page 26, which I will show below, he claimed that there is a subspace $V'$ of a complete normed $K$ -vector space $V$ with $(y_{\mu})_{\mu \in M}$ as its orthonormal basis. However, I wonder how to construct this subspace explicitly. Theorem 6. Let $K$ be a field with a complete valuation, and $V$ a complete normed $K$ -vector space with an orthonormal basis $(x_{\nu})_{\nu \in N}$ . Write $R$ for the valuation ring of $K$ , and consider a system of elements $$y_{\mu}=\sum_{\mu \in M}c_{\mu\nu}x_{\nu} \in V^{o}, \mu \in M$$ where the smallest subring of $R$ containing all coefficients $c_{\mu\nu}$ is bald. Then, if the residue classes $\tilde{y}_\mu \in \tilde{V}$ form a $k$ -basis of $\tilde{V}$ , the elements $y_\mu$ form an orthonormal basis of $V$ . Proof: The systems $(x_{\nu})_{\nu \in N}$ and $y_{\mu}=\sum_{\mu \in M}$ form a $k$ -basis of $\tilde{V}$ . So $M$ and $N$ have the same cardinality, and $M$ is at most countable. In particular, $y_{\mu}=\sum_{\mu \in M}$ is an orthonormal basis of a subspace $V' \subset V$ . ...

Denote the set of symmetric elements w.r.t. $\iota$ by $S$ and  the set of skew-symmetric elements w.r.t. $\iota$ by $K$ . Notice that even polynomials are symmetric elements w.r.t. $\iota$ , while odd polynomials are skew-symmetric elements w.r.t. $\iota$ . Write $f=s+k$ , where $s \in S$ and $k \in K$ . Clearly, $\mathbb{C}[f] \subseteq \mathbb{C}[t]$ is a UFD ( $\mathbb{C}[f]$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{C}[t]$ ). Question 1: Is it possible to find a general form of $f$ such that $R_{f}:=\mathbb{C}[s,k]$ is a UFD? Partial answer: In the following four cases $R_{f}$ is a UFD: (i) $k=0$ , so $f=s \in S$ , and then $R_{f}=\mathbb{C}[s,0]=\mathbb{C}[s] \cong \mathbb{C}[t]$ . (ii) $s=0$ , so $f=k \in K$ , and then $R_{f}=\mathbb{C}[0,k]=\mathbb{C}[k] \cong \mathbb{C}[t]$ . (iii) $k=t$ , so $R_{f}=\mathbb{C}[s,t]=\mathbb{C}[t]$ . (iv) $s=k^{2m}$ for some $m$ , so $R_{f}=\mathbb{C}[k^{2m},k]=\mathbb{C}[k] \cong \mathbb{C}[t]$ . For example, $s=\lambda t^6$ , $k=\mu t^3$ , so $R_{f}=\mathbb{C}[\lambda t^6,\mu t^3]=\mathbb{C}[t^3] \cong \mathbb{C}[t]$ . Question 1': Are there additional cases? Non-example: For $f=t^3+t^2$ , $R_{f}=\mathbb{C}[t^2,t^3]$ is not a UFD, as $t^2t^2t^2=t^3t^3$ shows. Remark: This question is relevant, especially the comments of Mohan and user26857, saying the following: ""If $R$ is Noetherian, integrally closed and dimension one $\mathbb{C}$ -subalgebra of the polynomial ring, it is isomorphic to $\mathbb{C}[t]$ "". Therefore, here, if $R_{f}$ is not a UFD, then it is not isomorphic to $\mathbb{C}[t]$ , hence $R_{f}$ is not integrally closed. On the other hand, if $R_{f}$ is integrally closed, then it equals its integral closure, which is of the form $\mathbb{C}[g]$ for some $g \in \mathbb{C}[t]$ (= this result appears in the paper of Paul Eakin ""A note on finite dimensional subrings of polynomial rings""). Therefore, $R_{f}$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{C}[t]$ , hence it is a UFD. Summarizing, my questions 1 and 1' are equivalent to the following question: Question 1'': Let $s \in S$ (= even polynomials), $k \in K$ (= odd polynomials). Is it possible to find general forms of $s$ and $k$ such that $R_{s+k}=\mathbb{C}[s,k]$ is integrally closed? (Are cases (i) , (ii) and (iii) the only ones?). Important remark to question 1'': This question and its answer are highly relevant. Question 2: I guess that questions 1 and 1' are not too difficult (perhaps some algebraic geometry is needed?),   so what if we replace $\mathbb{C}$ by an arbitrary UFD $D$ ?

(iv) for some , so . For example, , , so . Question 1': Are there additional cases? Non-example: For , is not a UFD, as shows. Remark: This question is relevant, especially the comments of Mohan and user26857, saying the following: ""If is Noetherian, integrally closed and dimension one -subalgebra of the polynomial ring, it is isomorphic to "". Therefore, here, if is not a UFD, then it is not isomorphic to , hence is not integrally closed. On the other hand, if is integrally closed, then it equals its integral closure, which is of the form for some (= this result appears in the paper of Paul Eakin ""A note on finite dimensional subrings of polynomial rings""). Therefore, is isomorphic to , hence it is a UFD. Summarizing, my questions 1 and 1' are equivalent to the following question: Question 1'': Let (= even polynomials), (= odd polynomials). Is it possible to find general forms of and such that is integrally closed? (Are cases (i) , (ii) and (iii) the only ones?). Important remark to question 1'': This question and its answer are highly relevant. Question 2: I guess that questions 1 and 1' are not too difficult (perhaps some algebraic geometry is needed?),   so what if we replace by an arbitrary UFD ? Any comments are welcome!
