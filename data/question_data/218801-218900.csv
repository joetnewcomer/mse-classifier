10,Missile Guidance Course Correction,Missile Guidance Course Correction,,"Background: I am controlling a simulated (programming) missile in a 2D space (no drag). The missile knows which direction it wants to go (the intended velocity vector direction). It is always accelerating along it's axis (the direction it is pointed) with some acceleration A. The missile cannot turn off its engine. It can only apply a torque to its body to change the direction it is facing, and thus change the direction its accelerating, and through this method only, change it's velocity vector. The goal is to be flying in the intended direction. It starts out in some random orientation with some (usually small) velocity. Goal Have the missile traveling in the intended direction for the remainder of the flight as quickly as possible . Mathy Recap All in 2D space so all vectors have (x y). Missile Acceleration A (how much the missile accelerates per second) Missile Angular Acceleration T (The rate at which we can increase our angular velocity) Current Direction Vector D (direction missile is facing and accelerating) Current Velocity Vector C (direction missile is traveling) Current Angular Velocity Y (how quickly is the missile spinning) Intended Velocity Vector V (direction missile wants to be traveling) Note: Application of + T or - T is the only way to control the missile. Example Bad Solutions Just rotate the missile so it is pointing in the right direction. This doesn't work because we will have some transverse velocity left over, and will never cancel it out. My Almost Solution: Just point the missile so D is equal to C mirrored across V so we cancel out the transverse velocity. Then, when C = V , just rotate back so D = V . This could work, but by the time the missile has rotated back so D = V , C has changed since we were pointing off of V while we rotated our missile back. The same peoblem will happen when we correct this new vector, and we will woble. I need a way to know when to start rotating back so that just when I reach D = V , the missiles acceleration has also made C = V . This seems like calculus since i need to know the total change (integral) of my vector over the time it takes to rotate back. And my rotational position is an acceleration curve itself since i cant just set velocity.

I have tried to determine the item top-left coordinates before the resize, apply the transformation (which involves replacing current item transform with the transform that has the new parameters), determine the item top-left coordinates again, and shift by the change. The result was... horrific. Item still moves on resize after rotate, but the rotation anchor changed to bottom-right... I don't understand why. (I have tried many other ways to offset the move, none worked). Assume a rectangular object that has been rotated (perhaps also initially resized), around its center. (in image, the green text).

So, everytime  ($a=b$  and  $c=0$)  then  $(a,b,0,0)=(0,0,0,a+b)$. $x>=-.5$ $x\leq1$ $y\geq\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ $y\leq-\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ $z\geq0$ $z\leq765$ this could mathematically be up to $1020$ but will be always be $\leq 765$, because $a+b+2d \leq 510$. $a\geq0$ $b\geq0$ $c\geq0$ $d\geq0$ $a\leq255$ $b\leq255$ $c\leq255$ $d\leq255$ $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are all integers. I can find $a$, $b$, and $c$, when I don't use $d$. but I would like to find what the highest $d$ value can be; while $a$, $b$, and $c$ are between or equal to $0$ and $255$. When $d=0$, I get the formulas I want: $a=\dfrac{z}{3}(2x+1)$ $b=\dfrac{z}{3}*(\sqrt{3}y-x+1)$ $c=-\dfrac{z}{3}(x+\sqrt{3}y-1)$ $d=0$ When $θ$ of $(x,y)$ from $(0,0)$ is $60°$ then only $d$ exists. When $θ$ of $(x,y)$ from $(0,0)$ is between $-120°$ and $60°$ then only $a$,$c$, and $d$ exists. When $θ$ of $(x,y)$ from $(0,0)$ is between $60°$ and $240°$ then only $b$,$c$, and $d$ exists. When $θ$ of $(x,y)$ from $(0,0)$ is $240°$ (aka $-120°$) then only $c$ exists. But I'd like the highest $d$ value; not lowest. note: $atan(\dfrac{y}{x})$.",,"['trigonometry', 'polynomials']"

Their cartesian coordinates are: \begin{align*} (\sin(20°)\cos(10°), \sin(20°)\sin(10°),\cos(20°))&=(0.3368,0.0594,0.9397)\\ (\sin(100°)\cos(100°), \sin(100°)\sin(100°),\cos(100°))&=(-0.1710,0.9698,-.1736)\\ (\sin(140°)\cos(-80°), \sin(140°)\sin(-80°),\cos(140°))&=(0.1116,-0.6330,-.7660) \end{align*} THIS IS WHERE I BEGIN TO HAVE PROBLEMS UNDERSTANDING: The cosines of the angles between radii $OA$, $OB$ and $OC$ are equal to the dot product of the corresponding position vectors.  Thus \begin{align*} \angle AOB&=\cos^{-1}(-0.1631)=1.7347\text{ radians}\\ \angle BOC&=\cos^{-1}(-0.5000)=2.0944\text{ radians}\\ \angle COA&=\cos^{-1}(-0.7198)=2.3743\text{ radians} \end{align*} Where did they get those numbers?

It's the best I could come up with. First of all, this question is related to another question I posted here , but that question wasn't posed correctly and ended up generating responses that may be helpful for some people who stumble upon the question, but don't address my problem as it stands. Also, a disclaimer: I am going to be posting some code here. I will be annotating it to try to make it as clear as possible what I am doing. Okay, so I am using the Processing programming language to move a box around randomly(according to Perlin noise) As the box moves around, I would like it to rotate such that it looks like it is rolling. I am not looking to simulate exact physics here, I am only looking for a visually pleasing solution. The general rules for rotation are that, if the box is only moving to the right, then it should rotate around the Y axis such that it rotates to the right and if the box is only moving upwards, it should rotate about the  $X$-axis such that it looks like it is rolling directly upwards. In other words, if this is what the box normally looks like: Then, if I say: rotate2D(45,0) I should get: and if I say rotate2D(0,45) I should get: (for clarity, the function declaration for rotate2D looks like rotate2D(horizontal, vertical) ) Processing makes this easy to do with the rotation functions that it provides, which are: rotateX(); rotateY(); rotatez(); The problem arises when you want to rotate in 2 dimensions simultaneously. You see, in Processing, If I call rotateX() to rotate an object about the $X$-axis, it is actually the coordinate system itself that gets shifted and all of the other axis go along with it, so when I go to do rotateY() after doing a rotateX() I wont get the result I want because the $Y$-axis that I am rotating around has now been skewed. You can see this in the pictures above. So, If I do: rotateX(radians(45)); rotateY(radians(45)); I get: and if I do: rotateY(radians(45)); rotateX(radians(45)); I get: But what I want is something like: which I drew by calling my function rotate2D() The problem is that the results that my function produces are a bit counter intuitive. It is not apparent in the above example, but lets say I want to do: rotate2D(90,90); . I would think that would produce a box that looks like It hasn't been rotated at all right? However, it actually produces: This is my current implementation of rotate2D() The Function: void rotate2D(float horizontal, float vertical) {     float[] rotations ={horizontal, vertical};   if(rotations[0]>rotations[1])   {     float tmp = rotations[1];     rotations[1]=rotations[0];     rotations[0]=tmp;   }     if(rotations[1]==vertical) rotateX(radians(rotations[1]-rotations[0]));   else rotateY(radians(rotations[1]-rotations[0]));    float hIncr= (horizontal<0) ? -0.1 : 0.1;   float vIncr= (vertical<0) ? -0.1 : 0.1;   for(float i=0; i<=abs(rotations[0]);i+=0.1)   {         rotateY(radians(hIncr));     rotateX(radians(vIncr));   }     } Function Explanation: What the function is doing is essentially as follows (and this is all you really need to address the question from a mathematical standpoint). The function slowly performs a bunch of $X$ and $Y$ axis rotations right after each other by a small amount each time(0.1 degrees) until it reaches an upper bound. That upper bound is the smaller of the values that the function was passed. The box will have already been rotated about the proper axis by the difference between the larger and the smaller value before this sequence takes place. To further clarify, I am looking for a mathematical explanation for why this process is producing counter intuitive results, which will hopefully shed light on a solution. The ideal end goal here is to find a formula that i can use to simulate rotation about a fixed axis in multiple dimensions when all I can do is rotate 'the world' one axis at a time as described above (which is essentially equivalent to rotating the objects relative axes) please do not hesitate to ask me to clarify further. Thanks in advance. EDIT After reading the comments, I now understand that rotations about 2 axis do not commute and I should not expect the results that I was previously expecting. What I am calculating and passing to my function is the net rotation in each direction. So, is it possible to edit my formula so that it produces this net rotation? For example, in the 90/90 example, If I continue the sequence for ~37 extra steps (127 total) I get the result that I intuitively want to get) This would need to work for all combinations of inputs though.","Sorry if the title is a bit cryptic.

Also, the geometric proof is nice, but it doesn't show (to me) why adding angle A to B is the same as adding angle B to A Earlier today I asked if trigonometry could exist in one dimension, and I think the answer is yes In another question on this site, someone brought up the idea of matrix multiplication - now I know the mechanics of it, but have literally no idea why it works So, if anyone had any extra insight into this weird formula, that would really be greatly appreciated!!
