0,"Sum of difference of numbers in an arrangement of the numbers $0,1,2,\cdots, n$",Sum of difference of numbers in an arrangement of the numbers,"0,1,2,\cdots, n","A seemingly interesting (easy?) problem came to mind and I thought it would be nice to ask your opinion about it. Suppose we are going to arrange numbers $0$ to $n$ in a row in such a way that the sum of the difference between adjacent numbers is max. How could we accomplish this? How could we determine the maximum sum of the difference? How about the minimum? As an example let us take the numbers $0,1,2,3,4$. Let us look at some arrangements: $0,1,2,3,4$; the difference between the adjacent numbers are $1,1,1,1$ so the sum is $4$ $1,3,4,0,2$; the difference between the adjacent numbers are $2,1,4,2$ so the sum is $9$ $1,4,0,3,2$; the difference between the adjacent numbers are $3,4,3,1$ so the sum is $11$ $3,0,4,1,2$; the difference between the adjacent numbers are $3,4,3,1$ so the sum is $11$ I figured that the arrangement that will give us the minimum sum is the arrangement $1,2,3,...,n$ because all the difference would just be $1$ and their sum is $n-1$. I think the maximum sum can be attained by arranging the numbers in the following way: Place the number $n$ between $0$ and $1$. Then place $n-1$ next to $0$ and $n-2$ next to $1$ and so on. An additional question, if we already know the minimum and maximum would it be possible to always get an arrangement that will give a sum for all the values between the minimum and the maximum? I tried it with $0,1,2,3$ and I was able to find arrangements for all the values between $3$ and $7$. Maybe this problem has been asked before but I can't find it on the net. Any ideas?

2,Find the number of ways that 2n people may be paired.,Find the number of ways that 2n people may be paired.,,"Question: Find the number of ways that 2n people may be paired. I have figured this problem out, and I'm fairly certain that there are $\frac{(2n)!}{2^{n} n!}$ ways. However, I cannot seem to work this out using generating functions. Consider the recurrence relation for this problem. It is given by $a_{n} = (2n-1)a_{n-1}$. It is immediate by inspection that this is just $(2n-1) \cdot (2n-3) \dots 3 \cdot 1$, which agrees with my above answer. However, this does not agree with the way I have been instructed to solve recurrence relations (other than through the use of generating functions), which is to set $a_{n} = \alpha^{n}$, and solve for $\alpha$, which gives us $a_{n} = (2n-1)^{n}$. Why did this approach not work out? And as far as solving this using generating functions, I've worked out that $$g(x) - a_{0} = \displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{n}x^{n}= \displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(2n-1)a_{n-1}x^{n}= 2\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}n a_{n-1}x^{n} - \displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{n-1}x^{n}$$ This reduces to: $$g(x)-a_{0} = 2x\displaystyle\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}(m+1)a_{m}x^{m} - xg(x)$$ I'm having trouble re-expressing the power series with the $(m+1)$ multiplier. To this end, I would like to ask if there is a straightforward way to re-express a power series of the form  $\displaystyle\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}m \cdot a_{m}x^{m}$? I know that $x\left(\frac{d}{dx} \frac{1}{1-x}\right) = \displaystyle\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}mx^{m}$, so I figure that $x\left(\frac{d}{dx} g(x) \right)$ should do the trick, but I wasn't able to make that approach work out.","Question: Find the number of ways that 2n people may be paired.

4,Computing Coefficients for Generalized Combinatorial Sets,Computing Coefficients for Generalized Combinatorial Sets,,"I'm new to Combinatorics and am wondering if there is a well-known generalization to the binomial coefficients in the following sense: The binomial coefficients, $n \choose d$, can be considered as the number of ways in which $d$ objects can be chosen from among $n$ such that order of selection doesn't matter and no object may be selected more than once, while the multi-set coefficients, ${\big(\!{n\choose d}\!\big)}={n+d-1\choose d}$, enumerate the ways in which $d$ objects can be chosen from among $n$ objects such that order doesn't matter but any object may be chosen any number of times. Is there a middle ground? Specifically, one in which $d$ objects are chosen from among $n$ such that order doesn't matter but the $i^{th}$ object may be selected no more than $k_i$ times? Heuristically, there are two fairly obvious approaches for calculating these numbers (aside from brute force). Let's call these numbers $C(n,d;K)$ for convenience, where $K\equiv \{k_1,k_2,...,k_n\}$. First, one could find the coefficients of polynomials of the form $$ {\large\prod_{i=0}^{n}{\huge(}\sum_{j=0}^{k_i}(x^j){\huge)}=\sum_{m=0}^{N}C(n,m;K)x^m} $$ where $k_0\equiv 0$ and $N=\sum_{i=0}^{n}k_i$. On the other hand, one could use an algorithm similar in logic to that of Pascal's Triangle wherein the $C(n,d;K)$ are calculated by summing $k_n$ terms with $n$-value $n'=n-1$ and with $K'=K-\{k_n\}$ and $N'=N-k_n$ (i.e. from the previous ""line"" in a generalized Pascal's Triangle). $$ \large{C(n,d;K)=\sum_{m=d-k_n}^{d}C(n',m;K')} $$ with $C(n',m;K')=0$ for all $m<0$ and all $m>N'$. To help clarify, here's an example: Suppose we have 4 object types with the following $k$-values $k_1=1,\ k_2=2,\ k_3=3,\ k_4=4.$ From this we can construct a generalized Pascal's Triangle: $\underline{n=0}:\ 1\\\underline{n=1}:\ 1\ \ 1\\\underline{n=2}:\ 1\ \ 2\ \ 2\ \ 1\\\underline{n=3}:\ 1\ \ 3\ \ 5\ \ 6\ \ 5\ \ 3\ \ 1\\\underline{n=4}:\ 1\ \ 4\ \ 9\ \ 15\ \ 20\ \ 22\ \ 20\ \ 15\ \ 9\ \ 4\ \ 1$ Each term in the $n$th row of the triangle is computed by sliding a window of size $k_n+1$ across the $(n-1)^{th}$ row of the triangle and summing the terms within that window (i.e. for the 3rd row [recall that $k_3=3$], $1=0+0+0+1$, $3=0+0+1+2$, $5=0+1+2+2$, and so on). Like Pascal's Triangle, these generalized triangles have many convenient properties. For instance, the $n^{th}$ row always has $N_n+1$ terms in it; the rows are always symmetrical; and, the final row in the triangle (the one which provides the coefficients we are looking for) doesn't depend on the order in which you compute the previous rows (i.e. the $n=4$ row would look the same in the above example even if the $k$-values were swapped around [e.g. $k_1=2,\ k_2=4$, etc.]). Perhaps the most interesting property is the following: $$ \large{\sum_{m=0}^{N}C(n,m;K)=\prod_{j=0}^{n}(k_j+1)} $$ So in the above example this implies that the sum of the $n^{th}$ row is $(n+1)!$, or in the limiting case of the binomial coefficients (in which all $k_i=1$), the sum of the $n^{th}$ row is $2^n$ - as expected. Clearly, there are methods for computing these general set coefficients, but I have been unable to find any literature on a concise formula for the $C(n,d;K)$ given all the parameters of the problem or even anything about efficient methods for computing one of these coefficients without the use of the polynomial generating function cited above.

It can be shown (see below for an arithmetic proof) that $n\mid R(n,d)$. My question is whether anyone knows of a combinatorial proof of this fact? Feel free to make $d\geq 1$ if this makes the question have a more combinatorial flavor. Sketch: Suppose $n$ has prime decomposition $n = p_1^{e_1}\cdots p_r^{e_r}$. We prove that $n\mid R(n,d)$ by induction on $r\geq 1$. When $r = 1$, so $n = p^e$, one computes $$R(p^e, d) = d^{p^e} - d^{p^{e-1}} = d^{p^{e-1}}\left(d^{p^{e-1}(p-1)} - 1\right).$$ If $p\mid d$, it's easy to see $n = p^e\mid d^{p^{e-1}}$, so $n\mid R(n,d)$. If $p\nmid d$, then Fermat's little theorem gives that $d^{p-1} = 1 + pm$ for some $m\in \mathbb{Z}$, so $$d^{p^{e-1}(p-1)} - 1 = (1 + pm)^{p^{e-1}} - 1 = (1 + p^em') - 1 = p^em' = nm'$$ for some $m'\in \mathbb{Z}$. This proves the base case of the induction. To do the induction step, assume $n = ap^e$, where $p\nmid a$, and you know that $a\mid R(a,d)$ for all integers $d$. One now computes $$R(n,d) = R(a, d^{p^e}) - R(a, d^{p^{e-1}}),$$ and hence by induction $a\mid R(n,d)$. On the other hand, $$R(a,d^{p^e}) - R(a,d^{p^{e-1}}) = \sum_{k\mid a}\mu(a/k)\left(d^{kp^e} - d^{kp^{e-1}}\right),$$ and every term on the right hand side is divisible by $d^{p^e} - d^{p^{e-1}}$, which in turn is divisible by $p^e$ from our work in the previous paragraph. Thus $p^e\mid R(n,d)$. Since $(a,p) = 1$, it follows that $n = ap^e\mid R(n,d)$, completing the proof. Context: When $d\geq 2$, the expression  $R(n,d)$ is the degree of the $n$-th dynatomic polynomial of any polynomial map $f\colon \mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}$ of degree $d$, so these expressions have some dynamical significance. For many (but not all) such $f$, the  $n$th dynatomic polynomial of $f$ is the polynomial whose roots are exactly the $f$-periodic points with exact period $n$. Since these points break up into cycles of length $n$ under the dynamics of $f$, it therefore follows that $R(n,d)$ is divisible by $n$.","Let $d$ and $n$ be integers, with $n\geq 2$, and define $$R(n,d) := \sum_{k\mid n} \mu( n/k)d^k,$$ where $\mu$ is the Möbius function .

22,Probability of finding specific set of coloured balls within larger set of random-drawn balls,Probability of finding specific set of coloured balls within larger set of random-drawn balls,,"In this question I was helped with calculating the probability of drawing specific set of M coloured balls from a set of N coloured balls. Now I am looking for a solution for an extended problem: what is the probability of finding my specific set of M balls among Q balls (where Q > M), drawn from the same pool of N balls. For example: there are 100 balls in the box: 50 red, 30 blue and 20 white. I randomly draw (without replacement) 15 balls from the box. What is the probability of finding among them a set of 6 balls, where 2 of them are red, 2 blue and 2 white? Using the variables: N = 100: n1 = 50, n2 = 30, n3 = 20 M = 6: m1 = 2, m2 = 2, m3 = 2 Q = 15 While there are methods how to calculate the result for any specific input values, I am looking for a universal algorithm that would give result for any input values. Right now, I find it hard how to make a jump from the simpler problem of drawing exactly M balls: while it feels there should be some kind of multiplier that corrects for the extra freedom of drawing additional Q-M balls, this surely is not simple one, because these extra balls can themselves contain the set M, or there is partial overlapping, so there should be some smart way how to deduct all those duplicate combinations. Edit: complemented with empirical data from virtual experiment. I went forward to build a program to perform virtual experiments. Of course, computer random generators are not true random, but that's the best I have and for the sake of this experiment, I think, they are random enough. So, I created the pool: a set of 2 red, 3 blue and 4 white balls. My sample size is 6 balls, and I consider the sampling a success, if it contains (at least) 1 red, 1 blue and 1 white ball. Running the simulation one million times I get probability of 90.4858%. That does not necessarily exactly matches the calculated probability (whatever it is), but should be pretty close.

We assume that no three chords intersect at one point. a) How many parts do the chords dissect the disk? b) How many triangles are formed whose sides are the chords or their fragments? I think the answer to a) is $2^n$. But I couldn't find a way to approach b), so I calculated the values for small $n$ and asked OEIS about them. I got A006600 . And it appears that there is no known formula for all $n$. This page says that $\text{triangles}(n) = P(n) - T(n)$ where $P(n)$ is the number of triangles for a convex n-gon in general   position. This means there are no three diagonal through one point   (except on the boundary). (There are no degenarate corners.)   This number is easy to calculate as: $$P(n) = {n\choose 3} + 4{n\choose 4} + 5{n\choose5} + {n\choose6}        = {n(n-1)(n-2)(n^3 + 18 n^2 - 43 n + 60)\over720}$$ The four terms count the triangles in the following manner [CoE76]: $n\choose3$: Number of trianges with 3 corners at the border. $4{n\choose4}$: Number of trianges with 2 corners at the border. $5{n\choose5}$: Number of trianges with 1 corners at the border. $n\choose6$: Number of trianges with 0 corners at the border. $T(n)$ is the number of triple-crossings (this is the number of   triples of diagonals which are concurrent) of the regular $n$-gon.   It turns out that such concurrences cannot occur for n odd, and,   except for obvious cases, can only occur for $n$ divisible by $6$.   Among other interesting results, Bol [Bol36] finds values of n   for which $4$, $5$, $6$, and $7$ diagonals are concurrent and shows that   these are the only possibilities (with the center for exception). The function $T(n)$ for $n$ not divisible by $6$ is: $$T(n) = {1\over8}n(n-2)(n-7)[2|n] + {3\over4}n[4|n].$$ where $[k|n]$ is defined as $1$ if $k$ is a divisor of $n$ and otherwise $0$. The intersection points need not lie an any of lines of symmetry of   the $2m$-gon, e. g. for $n=16$ the triple intersection of $(0,7),(1,12),(2,14)$.

35,Counting number of $k$-sequences,Counting number of -sequences,k,"I am studying a special type of a sequence on the naturals which I am calling a weak arithmetic progression. Formally I call a k-sequence $x_1<x_2<\cdots< x_k$ a weak arithmetic progression (WAP) if $\exists d\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $x_{i+1}-x_i\in\{1,d\}$. Now given two natural numbers $n\ge k\ge 1$, I wish to count the number of WAP's of length k within $\{1,2,3\ldots, n\}$, i.e. the number of WAP's of length k where each WAP consists of elements from $\{1,2\cdots n\}$. This is how I am reasoning: First fix a $d$. Consider any collection of $k$ numbers (as yet identified as $x_1,\cdots x_k$) and write them with spaces in the middle. We will count in how many ways we can put either $d$ or $1$ in the $k-1$ spaces or gaps between these numbers. Now if all the $k-1$ gaps between the numbers have to be filled up by $d$, then the first element of the $k$-WAP can be chosen in $n-(k-1)d$ ways. I will refer to this as $(n-(k-1)d)\tbinom{k-1}{0}$. If all but one of the gaps between the numbers have to be filled up by $d$, then there are $(n-(k-2)d-1)\tbinom{k-1}{1}$ ways, the binomial coefficient indicating where to place the number $1$ in the $k-1$ gaps. Likewise for all but $r$ gaps being filled up by $d$ there would be $(n-(k-r-1)d-r)\tbinom{k-1}{r}$ ways and so for a fixed $d$ there are $\sum_{r=0}^{k-1}(n-(k-r-1)d-r)\tbinom{k-1}{r}=(n-d(k-1))2^{k-1}+(d-1)(k-1)2^{k-2}$ $k$-WAPs. Now to get the total number of $k$-WAPs I sum over $d$ from $2$ to $n-k+1$, i.e. $\sum_{d=2}^{n-k+1}\Big ((n-d(k-1))2^{k-1}+(d-1)(k-1)2^{k-2}\Big )$ and furthermore since double counting of consecutive k-terms occurs for each $d$ in this sum, we subtract $(n-k+1)(n-k-1)$, i.e the final answer is $\sum_{d=2}^{n-k+1}\Big((n-d(k-1))2^{k-1}+(d-1)(k-1)2^{k-2}\Big )-(n-k-1)(n-k+1)$.

My work so far: let $g(n)$ denote the minimum $k$ . Clearly, $g(n) \ge n-1$ . However, if $g(n) = n-1$ but every $f_i$ maps the same subset of $U$ to 1 the construction is not possible. Thus $g(n) \ge n$ . I also have an upper bound, $g(n) \le (n-1)^2$ . Consider the following algorithm: in round $i$ , if $S_j$ does not include an element $f_i$ maps to 1 we add one such element to $S_j$ . Before round $n$ begins, we have $$\left\lvert\bigcup_i S_i\right\rvert = (n-1)\cdot (n-2) + (n-1) = (n-1)^2$$ thus if $g(n) \ge (n-1)^2$ the assignment is possible. Observations $g(2) = 2$ and $g(3) = 3$ . I can provide proofs if needed. Also it gets annoyingly more complex to compute $g(4)$ . For every $e \in U$ we can see the vector $f_1(e), \dots, f_n(e)$ as a $n$ -bit binary label, hence my title We can reduce $U$ to $U'$ such that $U'$ contains only elements that at least one function maps to 1 My intuition is that there is some connection between my problem and some (multi)graph edge coloring problem or bipartite coloring but I am not sure exactly what I am looking for. Any ideas? Edit: I found a different formulation and think it may be helpful to include it. Assume for now that we strengthen the needed property to $$ \forall S_i\ \forall j\ \exists e \in S_i: f_j(e) = 1$$ Consider the universe of elements $U = \{1,\dots,n\}$ and a collection of $m$ subsets of $U$ such that each $i \in U$ appears at  exactly $k$ of the $m$ sets. What is the least $k$ so that we can create $n$ non overlapping set covers of $U$ , i.e. no two set covers share a subset. To return to my original question let me define the ""almost set cover"" $C_i$ as the set cover of $U\setminus i$ . Then the question is what is the least $k$ so that we can create all the almost set covers without overlap. (Edit 3: based on the set cover formulation I also asked the question here ) Edit 2: A refinement of the upper bound is achievable via the pigeonhole principle. Before round $n$ begins, there  are $n-1$ nests of size $n-2$ and 1 nest of size $n-1$ . Thus if $g(n) \ge (n-2)^2 + n-1 + 1 = n^2 - 3n + 4$ the construction is once again possible. Also, this hints at a way to improve the upper bound a bit more: for instance if $g(n) = n^2 - 3n + 3$ we can only fail by one element in the last round. That can only occur when there are two elements $e, e'$ assigned in $S_i$ and $S_n$ respectively at round $t$ such that $f_t(e) = f_t(e') = 1$ and $f_n(e) =0, f_n(e')=1$ .

Given a finite group $G$ , let $\mu(G)$ be the Mobius function defined inductively by $\mu(1) = 1$ and for $G\neq 1$ $$\mu(G) = -\sum_{H<G} \mu(H).$$ Then we can define a generalized Euler totient $$\phi(G) := \sum_{H\leqslant G} [G:H]\mu(H) = |G|\sum_{H\leqslant G}\frac{\mu(H)}{|H|},$$ so that $\phi(\mathbb{Z}/n) = \phi(n)$ . This function came up while I was doing some computations in the incidence algebra of the lattice of subgroups of $G$ . I've seen a few papers that consider generalized Euler totients defined on finite groups, but they all seem to consider definitions that are not equivalent to the one given above. Which is actually pretty reasonable, since it turns out the above definition is trivial! Proposition. For any non-cyclic finite Abelian group $G$ , $\phi(G) = 0$ . It's not terribly difficult to prove this assertion. By multiplicativity it suffices to consider the case where $G$ is a non-cyclic $p$ -group. By standard properties of the Mobius function, $\mu(H) = 0$ unless $H$ is contained in the socle of $G$ . So it suffices to show the result for $G = (C_p)^n$ with $n>1$ . Using Hall's formula $$\mu((C_p)^n) = (-1)^n p^{\binom{n}{2}}$$ and basic counting we obtain the formula $$\phi((C_p)^n) = p^n \sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^{k}p^{\binom{k}{2}}p^{-k} \binom{n}{k}_p$$ where $\binom{n}{k}_p$ is the number of $k$ -dimensional subspaces in $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ .

97,Are there affine planes with no abelian group of translations?,Are there affine planes with no abelian group of translations?,,"I'm reading the classic book  ""Geometric algebra"" by Emil Artin and I have a question/reference request about a remark in it. In order to make this question self-contained, let me start by defining some notions. ""Affine plane"" is meant in the sense of incidence geometry. That is, a configuration of points and lines such that: 1) any two distinct points lie in a unique line, 2) given a line $l$ and a point $P$ not in $l$ there is a unique line parallel to $l$ through $P$ , and 3) there are three points which are not collinear. Similarly, by ""translation"" one means a mapping of the affine plane onto itself that either is the identity, or sends each line to a parallel line and has no fixed points (see definitions 2.3 and 2.5 of the book). We also define the ""direction"" of a translation $\tau$ as the set of all (parallel) lines $l$ with the property that if $P$ is in $l$ also $\tau(P)$ is in $l$ . It is then proven that for any affine plane the set of all translations form a group with composition, and that if there are two translations with different directions this group is abelian. Just after it, there is a remark (at the very end of section II.2, beginning of p.58 in my edition) where it is said: It is conceivable that the geometry contains only translations with a single direction $\pi$ (aside from the identity). It is an undecided question whether $T$ (the group of translations) has to be commutative in this case. Probably there do exist counter-examples, but none is known. Since this book is more than 50 years old, presumably today more is known about this question. My questions are: What are some examples of affine planes where all translations have the same direction? Is nowadays known if there is some affine plane with nonabelian group of translations (or if on the contrary, the translation group is always abelian)? I would appreciate any pointers to literature regarding these two questions. Thanks in advance.","I'm reading the classic book  ""Geometric algebra"" by Emil Artin and I have a question/reference request about a remark in it. In order to make this question self-contained, let me start by defining some notions. ""Affine plane"" is meant in the sense of incidence geometry. That is, a configuration of points and lines such that: 1) any two distinct points lie in a unique line, 2) given a line and a point not in there is a unique line parallel to through , and 3) there are three points which are not collinear. Similarly, by ""translation"" one means a mapping of the affine plane onto itself that either is the identity, or sends each line to a parallel line and has no fixed points (see definitions 2.3 and 2.5 of the book). We also define the ""direction"" of a translation as the set of all (parallel) lines with the property that if is in also is in . It is then proven that for any affine plane the set of all translations form a group with composition, and that if there are two translations with different directions this group is abelian. Just after it, there is a remark (at the very end of section II.2, beginning of p.58 in my edition) where it is said: It is conceivable that the geometry contains only translations with a single direction (aside from the identity). It is an undecided question whether (the group of translations) has to be commutative in this case. Probably there do exist counter-examples, but none is known. Since this book is more than 50 years old, presumably today more is known about this question. My questions are: What are some examples of affine planes where all translations have the same direction? Is nowadays known if there is some affine plane with nonabelian group of translations (or if on the contrary, the translation group is always abelian)? I would appreciate any pointers to literature regarding these two questions.

More generally, show that there exists a quadrilateral in a graph with $n$ vertices and $l$ sides where $$q\ge2,n=q^2+q+1,l\ge\frac12q(q+1)^2+1.$$ The simplest way of tracking quadrilaterals is to count angles. If $$A,B,C\in V;AB,BC\in E$$ then call this structure an angle. Two angles with the same pair of vertices sticking out form a quadrilateral. So we want to show that the number of angles exceeds the number of vertex pairs. Let the degree of vertices of $G$ be $d_i(i\in[1,7])$ . Then the number of angles is $S=\displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^7\mbox C_{d_i}^2$ . If there $\exists i,j$ for which $d_i-d_j\ge2$ , let $$d_i’=d_i-1,d_j’=d_j+1$$ and we have $$\mbox C_{d_i}^2+C_{d_j}^2>C_{d_i’}^2+C_{d_j’}^2\Longrightarrow S>S’.$$ This points out that the minimum of $S$ is reached when $d_1=2,d_2=\cdots=d_7=3$ or any other order. It is $$S_\min=6\times\mbox C_3^2+\mbox C_2^2=19<\mbox C_7^2=21.$$ Very unfortunately we didn’t reach our goal. In conclusion we need a more accurate way of counting quadrilaterals .","Show that there exists a quadrilateral in graph with vertices and sides.
