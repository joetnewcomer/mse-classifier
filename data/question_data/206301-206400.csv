I answered yes, $P(A) = \frac{1}{17}$, $P(B) = \frac{1}{13}$, $P(A \cap B) = \frac{1}{221}$, thus $P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B).$ 2. Let $A$ be the event that the two cards have the same rank. Let $C$ be the event that the two cards have the same suit. I answered no, because $P(A) = \frac{1}{17}$, $P(C) = \frac{4}{17}$, and $P(A \cap B) = 0$, because you can't have two cards in a standard deck of the same rank and suit. $0 \neq P(A)P(B)$. 3. Let $D$ be the event that the first card is a club. Let $E$ be the event that the second card is a club. I've found that $P(D) = \frac{1}{204}$.

Everyone must answer your questions truthfully. That is, if Alice and Bob are two people at the party, you can ask Alice whether she knows Bob; she must answer correctly.

I would really appreciate some guidance on this question, as I get the feeling there must be an easier way, or short cut to this question somewhere. I've tried using both generating functions and the usual method of solving non-homogeneous recurrence relations.

I pretty much went as far as I could go with it and still ran into a dead end, so i decided to try the usual method. Doing the usual method, I try to solve the homogeneous part first, which is reasonably easy. My characteristic polynomial is $x^3-12x+16=0$, giving me roots $\lambda = 2 $(of multiplicity 2) and $\lambda = -4 $ So my solution to the homogeneous part is: $$b_n = C_12^n+C_2n2^n+C_3(-4)^n$$ Now to get a particular solution, I try: $p_n = C_4n^2\cdot 6 \cdot 2^n + C_5n$ $$ \implies C_4n^2\cdot 6 \cdot 2^n + C_5n = 12(C_4(n-2)^2\cdot 6 \cdot 2^{(n-2)} + C_5(n-2)) - 16(C_4(n-3)^2\cdot 6 \cdot 2^{(n-3)} + C_5(n-3)) + 6\cdot2^n+25n $$ Another pretty nasty algebraic exercise (although not quite as bad as the generating function).

Prove that that if $g$ is any polynomial function in $n$, then there exists an integer $N$ such that $g(n)<p(n)$ for all $n>N$. Do not use the asymptotic Hardy-Ramanujan formula. Provided Proof . Enough to show $n^a<p(n)$ for fixed positive integer $a$. (This is just saying that we want to show $p(n)$ grows faster than any degree polynomial of $n$, right?) We have that $(i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_{a+1},1^{n-i_1-\cdots -i_{a+1}})$ is a partition of $n$ as long as $i_{a+1}\leq i_a\leq \cdots i_1 \leq \lfloor\frac{n}{a+1}\rfloor$. ( I really don't understand this step. What is this partition? Of the coefficients or terms of polynomial $p(n)$? And how do we know this is $\leq \lfloor\frac{n}{a+1}\rfloor$? ) The number of partitions $n$ of this form is multiset binomial coefficient $$\left(\dbinom{\lfloor \frac{n}{a+1}\rfloor}{a+1}\right)=\frac{\lfloor\frac{n}{a+1}\rfloor(\lfloor\frac{n}{a+1}\rfloor+1)\cdots(\lfloor\frac{n}{a+1}\rfloor+a-1)}{(a+1)!}$$ (I'm assuming that if I can understand (2.) then I can understand this line) This means $p(n)>\left(\binom{\lfloor \frac{n}{a+1}\rfloor}{a+1}\right)$ for all $n>0$. Since $a$ is constant, the given fraction grows with order $n^{a+1}$, which means $p(n)>n^a$ for $n$ sufficiently large. (Why does it grow with order $n^{a+1}$?)

For example:  In $\mathbb{Q}$, $r \sim s$ iff $r - s \in \mathbb{Z}$. I think I'm okay with most (?) of this.  I'd show this is an equivalence relation like so:  If $x, y, z \in \mathbb{Q}$, then $x - x = 0 \in \mathbb{Z}$, and so $x \sim x$.  Second, if $x \sim y$, then $y - x = -(x - y) \in \mathbb{Z}$, and so $x \sim y \implies y \sim x$. Finally, if $x \sim y$ and $y \sim z$, then $x - z = (x - y) - (z - y) \in \mathbb{Z}$, and so $x \sim z$. The two parts I'm not sure about:  First, that last f on the iff .  Essentially, this means I have to prove that if $r \sim s$, then their difference is an integer, right?  But I thought this is merely how this particular equivalence relation is defined.

In other fields of math, even copying a well worked out solution might help, since it elucidates in what setting one can properly use a theorem/approach. Do you have any recommendations of how to figure out conceptual elements in graph theory problem solving, i.e. how to figure out a setting and a general strategy that might be applicable to a certain style of problems? Are there any good reads in graph theory that point out problem solving strategies/ways of thinking, instead of focusing on results?","From my experience with problems in graph theory, these pose certain obstacles that to me seem to particular for discrete mathematics, among them are 1) A solution might be obvious at first sight, but extremely hard to rigorously formulate/proof. 2) A problem statement is very hard to grasp, such that I don't even know how to start. 3) I rarely see a measure of ""progress towards a solution""; either I get nowhere or I know from the beginning how to solve a problem/what theorem to use 4) Most problems seem to be ""individual"" in a sense that I can't identify a general concept that might be helpful for a problem that I will face in the future. In particular that means that finding too strong hints or even full solutions does not help at all.

I can prove one of them and the other I'm not so sure! 1: Every infinite set has a denumerable subset 2: Every infinite set is a subset of some denumerable set As you can see these two statements are closely related. I believe I can prove the first statement as follows: Proof #1: $S$ is an infinite set. Choose any $S_1$ in $S$ . Since $S$ is infinite and { $s_1$ } is finite, $S$ does not equal { $s_1$ } and so $S$ $-$ { $s_1$ } does not equal the empty set. Next, choose $s_2$ and with similar reasoning we have $S$ does not equal { $s_1,s_2$ } and $S$ $-$ { $s_1,s_2$ } is not the empty set. If we continue like this, we can create a set, say $A$ where $A$ $=$ { $s_1,s_2,s_3...$ } with no two elements of $A$ being equal. That makes sense for the proof of statement #1 hopefully!
