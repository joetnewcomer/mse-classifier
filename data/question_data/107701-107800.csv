97,Least number of circles required to cover a continuous function on a closed interval.,Least number of circles required to cover a continuous function on a closed interval.,,"Now asked on MO here . This question is a generalisation of a prior question . Given a continuous function $f :[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$ , what is the least number of  circles with radius $r$ required to cover the graph of $f$ ? It is easy to prove (by using the extreme value theorem) that only finitely many circles  are required to cover the graph of $f$ . But how can I find the least number of circles? I don't think a closed form exists (I also think Fourier series might be a part of the solution to this problem but I couldn't reach am algorithm using it), but is there another solution, like an indefinite integral? If there isn't, is there an algorithm that can solve this problem?","Now asked on MO here . This question is a generalisation of a prior question .

98,Determine the length of the rod that can be inscribed in a cuboid,Determine the length of the rod that can be inscribed in a cuboid,,"Question You have a cuboid of dimensions $2a \times 2b \times 2c $ .  I want the find the (maximum) length of the right circular cylindrical rod of radius $r$ , that can inscribed in the cuboid. Use whatever means, analytic or numerical, to find this length. Note:  A similar question concerning inscribing a square bar in a cuboid is addressed here . My initial thoughts: We have to find the direction of the axis of the cylinder (the rod), and with an assumed length, we have the base (which is of known radius) touching the three adjacent intersecting faces of the cuboid near the end the of the rod.  The unknowns here are spherical coordinates angles $\theta$ and $\phi$ specifying the direction of the axis, and in addition to that, the length of the rod.  That's it, only three unknowns. To that end, let the cuboid be centered at the origin, its faces that intersect in the first octant at $x = a , y = b , z = c $ .  Let the length of the cylinder be $L = 2 \ell$ .  The unit vector direction of the axis of cylinder which passes through the center of the cuboid (the origin) can be parameterized as follows $ A = ( \sin \theta \cos \phi, \sin \theta \sin \phi, \cos \theta ) $ Two vectors that are orthogonal to $A$ are $ u_1 = (\cos \theta \cos \phi, \cos \theta \sin \phi, - \sin \theta)$ $u_2 = (- \sin \phi, \cos \phi, 0 ) $ The top base of the cylinder is described by $ P(t) = \ell A + r u_1 \cos t + r u_2 \sin t $ And we want this circle to be tangent to the plane $x = a$ , therefore, we want $P_x(t) = \ell A_x + r u_{1x} \cos t + r u_{2x} \sin t $ to have a single solution to $P_x(t) = a $ This implies that $ a - \ell \sin \theta \cos \phi = r \sqrt{ \cos^2 \theta \cos^2 \phi + \sin^2 \phi } $ Similarly for the other two faces, we have $ b - \ell \sin \theta \sin \phi = r \sqrt{ \cos^2 \theta \sin^2 \phi + \cos^2 \phi} $ and $ c - \ell \cos \theta = r \sin \theta $ This is a system of $3$ (nonlinear) equations in the three unknowns $ \theta, \phi, \ell $ .  They can be solved numerically quite easily using the well-known Newton-Raphson multi-variate method, provided that you have a good initial guess of the unknowns vector $X = [\theta, \phi, \ell ] $ . This is what I have as a answer to this question.  I appreciate other answers, or comments on the question and the attempted answer.","Question You have a cuboid of dimensions .

99,why cant i integrate the derivative of a cylinders volume to find it again?,why cant i integrate the derivative of a cylinders volume to find it again?,,"For a cylinder, the volume formula is given by $V = \pi r^2 H $ . To find the differential ( dV ), we differentiate ( V ) with respect to ( r ) and ( H ), yielding $\left( dV = 2 \pi r H dr + \pi r^2 dH \right)$ . Upon integrating ( dV ) again, we obtain $( 2 \pi r^2 H )$ . However, I'm confused about where the factor of two originates. Additionally, in calculus, it's taught that to derive the formula for the volume of a cylinder, we perform a double integral of ( da ) over the cylinder's surface area ( A ) and ( dh ) over the height ( H ). This suggests that $( V = \iint 2 \pi r dr dh )$ , or equivalently $( V = \int \pi r^2 dH )$ , which only includes the second term of the earlier ( dV ) expression. Does this imply that the first term is zero?","For a cylinder, the volume formula is given by . To find the differential ( dV ), we differentiate ( V ) with respect to ( r ) and ( H ), yielding .
