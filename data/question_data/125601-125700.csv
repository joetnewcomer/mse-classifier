I understand a bijection from X to X implies that $\forall x \in X$, $x \mapsto x$. So, just as in geometric symmetry a set is symmetrical if it becomes itself again after some map. All well and good, but how do composite functions relate to this? Surely taking the bijective requirement into consideration the only operation permitted is one that effectively leaves the set unchanged? So, can anyone please either explain how composite functions fit in my definition or (equally fine) provide an example of a function that works so I can try to fit the idea to the definitions I've come across. Many thanks.",,[]
17,A conjecture about non-nilpotent groups,A conjecture about non-nilpotent groups,,"A finite group, $G$ , is nilpotent if its upper central series terminates (at $i \in \mathbb{N})$ with $Z^i(G)=G$ , where $Z^i(G)$ is it's $i$ -th center which can be described as $\{x \in G\mid \forall y \in G : [x,y]\in Z_{i-1}(G)\}$ where $[x,y]$ is the commutator of $x$ and $y$ in $G$ (in other words, it is the set of elements that commute with one another up to an element of the $(i-1)$ -th center). A finite group, $G$ , is non-nilpotent if it is not nilpotent. In this case, we still have, by finiteness of $G$ that the upper central series will terminate after finitely many steps, but now we have an $i \in \mathbb{N}$ at where $Z^i(G)=Z^{i+1}(G)$ , and yet $Z^i(G)\neq G$ , but rather a proper subgroup of $G$ . In this case, since the upper centers are all characteristic and thus normal, we can consider the quotient group, $Q=G/Z^i(G)$ . This group must be centerless, else we could take the pullback of $Z(Q)$ under the natural projection to obtain $Z^{i+1}(G)\supset  Z^i(G)$ with equality not holding, contradicting our assumption that the upper central series stabilized at $i$ . This gives a rather elegant characterization of non-nilpotent finite groups: A non-nilpotent finite group $G$ can be viewed as an extension of a nilpotent normal subgroup, $U=Z^i(G)$ by a centerless quotient group, $Q$ . In the most extreme case, the central series terminates immediately in the trivial group, and you obtain a centerless $G=Q$ . This shows that the centerless groups are the primitive elements of the class of non-nilpotent finite groups with the rest being constructed from them by extensions of nilpotent groups by centerless groups. A (finite) group, $G$ , is complete if it is centerless and isomorphic to its automorphism group $G\simeq\text{Aut}(G)$ . Conjecture: Suppose we have a non-nilpotent finite group $G$ , whose upper central series terminates at $i>0$ , meaning that $G$ is not centerless, and $Z^i(G)=Z^{i+1}(G)$ . Let $U=Z^i(G)$ , and suppose further that the centerless quotient $Q=G/U$ is complete, meaning $Q\simeq\text{Aut}(Q)$ . Lastly, suppose that the upper central series for $\text{Aut}(G)$ terminates at some $i_1\geq i$ , that is, the upper central series for $\text{Aut}(G)$ is at least as long as the upper central series for $G$ . Note in particularly that $\text{Aut}(G)$ is non-nilpotent, and so has a centerless quotient $Q_1$ . Then the claim is that the centerless quotients are isomorphic, $Q_1\simeq Q$ . I came up with the conjecture based on computer searches in GAP looking at the automorphism series for various small finite groups as far as I could construct them in GAP (many eventually reach very large groups and run into issues with memory or the size of the computation). Looking at the upper central series for each term of the automorphism series and comparing how they changed as you step through the automorphism series lead me to propose that the above conjecture holds in general for finite groups. Naturally a counterexample will be enough to disprove the claim, but I didn't find any looking at over 50 different automorphism series, so it may not be easy to find if it exists. I'm not really sure how to approach trying to prove this either. I don't really know enough about the relationship between a group and its automorphism group to leverage the givens in this conjecture productively. Edit 1: This is a response to David A. Craven's answer: I took the liberty of constructing the proposed group in GAP for $n=7$ . To do this, I needed to put all three of the $G_i$ 's into permutation groups so that the direct product operation in GAP would also return a permutation group, so that fast algorithms would be available for subsequent calculations. Specifically I used: G1:=SymmetricGroup(7); G2:=Group((1,2,3,4),(1,2)(3,4)); #This is D8 G3:=Group((1,2,3),(4,5,6),(7,8,9)); #This (Z_3)^3 #That G2 and G3 are as claimed can be checked by IdSmallGroup, is should return (8,3) for G2 and (27,5) for G3. #Now we can call DirectProduct and the result will be a permutation group G:=DirectProduct(G1,G2,G3); #Because this is a permutation group, computation of the upper central series is 'easy' for GAP, trying this without doing the above preparations lead to a computation that was taking minutes and still hadn't finished U:=UpperCentralSeriesOfGroup(G); From the above I obtained that $G$ has upper central series of length $2$ . With $Z(G)\simeq (54,15)$ , and $Z^2(G)\simeq (216,151)$ (Where (x,y) is the GAP library id for order x, id y.). GAP StructureDescription for U[1] confirms that $Z^2(G)\simeq\mathbb{Z}_3^3\times D_8$ . Next I constructed the quotient and confirmed it was the symmetric group (necessarily $S_7$ by an easy order argument). After a computation that took a few seconds I got the automorphism group, $A1$ , but it was not in the form of a permutation group, so I used NiceMonomorphism and then NiceObject to obtain a permutation group isomorphic to the automorphism group. This allows for fast(er) algorithms to used for computing its upper central series, which I found to be of length $2$ with $Z(A1)\simeq (8,5)$ and $Z^2(A1)\simeq (32,46)$ (again using GAP ids for the groups). The size of $A1$ is 905748480 which is twice that predicted in the answer (Which would be 452874240 if it had the structure given in the answer). I was able to get GAP to give me a structure description for $A1$ , which was $\mathbb{Z}_2^2\times D_8\times S_7\times \text{PSL}(3,3)$ . I suspect the comment that the proposed automorphism group is, in fact, a subgroup of index 2 in the full automorphism group is correct. The quotient $Q1$ is of order 28304640 (and so obviously not isomorphic to $S_7$ ), GAP gives a structure description of $S_7\times \text{PSL}(3,3)$ for this quotient. (So it is still a counter example for $i_1=i$ case).","A finite group, , is nilpotent if its upper central series terminates (at with , where is it's -th center which can be described as where is the commutator of and in (in other words, it is the set of elements that commute with one another up to an element of the -th center).

79,How are the elements of a dihedral group usually defined?,How are the elements of a dihedral group usually defined?,,"While searching online, I've come across two ways to define the elements of the dihedral group. Both ways are internally consistent and are fine as far as I can tell, but they are mutually exclusive, so I was wondering which of the two ways is more standard or commonly used. The two ways are as follows: Way 1. Elements are defined as transformations against a fixed set of axes. In this way of defining the elements, each element of $D_n$ is either a reflectional symmetry or a rotational symmetry of the polygon being considered. In an $n$ -gon, there are $n$ reflectional symmetries and $n$ rotational symmetries. The reflectional symmetries are described as follows: An $n$ -gon has $n$ axes of symmetry. For each axis of symmetry in the $n$ -gon there is an element in the dihedral group that reflects the $n$ -gon along that axis. It is important to note that these axes stay fixed, even after the n-gon itself undergoes a rotational symmetry. Similarly, there are $n$ rotational symmetries in the $n$ -gon being discussed, and each of these rotations is a member of $D_n$ . It is important to note that here, the rotations are always in the same direction, even if the shape undergoes reflectional symmetry. So, for example, an element $r$ that rotates a square $90^{\circ}$ clockwise will always rotate the square $90^{\circ}$ clockwise, even after the square is reflected. Way 2. Elements are defined as permutations of vertices. The second way of defining the elements of $D_n$ is that each element is defined as a permutation of vertices of the $n$ -gon. (It should be noted that there are in total $n!$ permutations of vertices, yet only $2n$ elements in $D_n$ ; this discrepancy is explained by the fact that a permutation must also preserve the structure of the $n$ -gon in order to be included in $D_n$ .) Like all permutations on a finite set, these permutations can be written out as cycles such as $(1234)$ , where $1$ , $2$ , $3$ , and $4$ are the names of vertices of a square, for example. Way 2 is actually distinct from Way 1, both geometrically and algebraically (as far as I can tell). There are still $n$ rotations and $n$ reflections, but unlike in Way 1 where the transformations are defined in terms of a fixed ""background"" which doesn't move as the $n$ -gon undergoes rotation or reflection, the transformations in Way 2 are now defined in terms of  the vertices of the $n$ -gon, which DO move as the $n$ -gon undergoes rotation or reflection. What this means is that in Way 2, the transformations change depending on the current orientation of the $n$ -gon. For example, consider the rotation of a square. In Way 1, we can let $r$ be the element that rotates the square $90^{\circ}$ clockwise. The direction of rotation ( $90^{\circ}$ clockwise or, equivalently, $270{\circ}$ counterclockwise) never changes, even after the square is reflected across one of its axes of symmetry. On the other hand, the roughly corresponding rotation in Way 2 would be something like the cycle $(1234)$ . Unlike $r$ , which always rotates the square $90^{\circ}$ clockwise, $(1234)$ may rotate the square $90^{\circ}$ either clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on whether the square has been reflected or not. Similarly, the axes of reflection in Way 2 move along with the square, while those of Way 1 remain fixed. The fact that the two ways are non-equivalent can also be verified algebraically (I think...). No isomorphism exists between the two Ways (at least as far as I can tell; I tried constructing an isomorphism by making a bijection between the elements as defined in Way 1 with the elements as defined in Way 2, matching the rotations and reflections in Way 1 with the corresponding ones in Way 2, but the bijection did not satisfy the criterion that $f(a)f(b) = f(ab)$ for all $a$ , $b$ in Way 1. The problem arose when $a$ was a rotation and $b$ was a reflection. However, if there actually is an isomorphism that I overlooked, please correct me.) My main question is: Which of these two ways is standard, or used more often by working mathematicians? Are both acceptable? It seems to me that Way 2 is just nicer all-around, mainly because all of the elements are permutations and can thus be written as cycles, which are easy to work with algebraically (by Cayley's Theorem, Way 1 is isomorphic to some group of permutations anyway, but then it seems like kind of a hassle finding a way to write it as cycles and whatnot.) If there are some benefits to Way 1, then I would like to learn about those too.

So, for example, an element that rotates a square clockwise will always rotate the square clockwise, even after the square is reflected. Way 2. Elements are defined as permutations of vertices. The second way of defining the elements of is that each element is defined as a permutation of vertices of the -gon. (It should be noted that there are in total permutations of vertices, yet only elements in ; this discrepancy is explained by the fact that a permutation must also preserve the structure of the -gon in order to be included in .) Like all permutations on a finite set, these permutations can be written out as cycles such as , where , , , and are the names of vertices of a square, for example. Way 2 is actually distinct from Way 1, both geometrically and algebraically (as far as I can tell). There are still rotations and reflections, but unlike in Way 1 where the transformations are defined in terms of a fixed ""background"" which doesn't move as the -gon undergoes rotation or reflection, the transformations in Way 2 are now defined in terms of  the vertices of the -gon, which DO move as the -gon undergoes rotation or reflection. What this means is that in Way 2, the transformations change depending on the current orientation of the -gon. For example, consider the rotation of a square. In Way 1, we can let be the element that rotates the square clockwise. The direction of rotation ( clockwise or, equivalently, counterclockwise) never changes, even after the square is reflected across one of its axes of symmetry. On the other hand, the roughly corresponding rotation in Way 2 would be something like the cycle . Unlike , which always rotates the square clockwise, may rotate the square either clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on whether the square has been reflected or not. Similarly, the axes of reflection in Way 2 move along with the square, while those of Way 1 remain fixed. The fact that the two ways are non-equivalent can also be verified algebraically (I think...). No isomorphism exists between the two Ways (at least as far as I can tell; I tried constructing an isomorphism by making a bijection between the elements as defined in Way 1 with the elements as defined in Way 2, matching the rotations and reflections in Way 1 with the corresponding ones in Way 2, but the bijection did not satisfy the criterion that for all , in Way 1. The problem arose when was a rotation and was a reflection. However, if there actually is an isomorphism that I overlooked, please correct me.) My main question is: Which of these two ways is standard, or used more often by working mathematicians? Are both acceptable? It seems to me that Way 2 is just nicer all-around, mainly because all of the elements are permutations and can thus be written as cycles, which are easy to work with algebraically (by Cayley's Theorem, Way 1 is isomorphic to some group of permutations anyway, but then it seems like kind of a hassle finding a way to write it as cycles and whatnot.) If there are some benefits to Way 1, then I would like to learn about those too.

About non-commutative we know, they have 1 Syllow 3-subgroup and 1 Syllow 5-subgroup. And next, that $M_3 \cup M_5 = G$ (if $M_3$, resp. $M_5$ is Syllow 3-subgroup, resp. Syllow 5-subgroup). $M_3$ and $M_5$ are single generated, than we can choose elements $f$ and $g$ satysfaing $<f>=M_3$ and $<g>=M_5$. Because there are characterictis, we get these equations: $f^{-1}gf=g^m$, where $m \in \{1,2,3,4\}$ and $g^{-1}fg=f^n$, where $n \in \{1,2\}$. $m$ and $n$ must supplying $|g|=|g^m|$ and $|f|=|f^n|$. But there is end of my way, i don't know how continue... Can anyone help? (Sorry for bad English)",,['group-theory']
99,Classifying finite groups where order is multiplicative on elements with coprime orders,Classifying finite groups where order is multiplicative on elements with coprime orders,,"It's well known that $|g_1 g_2| = |g_1||g_2|$ whenever $g_1$ and $g_2$ are commuting elements of a group with $\gcd(|g_1|, |g_2|) = 1$ . So, for example, $\gcd(|g_1|, |g_2|) = 1$ always implies that $|g_1 g_2| = |g_1||g_2|$ in an abelian group. I am interested in classifying finite groups where the above condition holds for every pair of elements when we drop the hypothesis that they must commute. More precisely, my question is the following. Question: Can we classify all finite groups $G$ in which $|g_1 g_2| = |g_1| |g_2|$ for every $g_1, g_2$ in $G$ with $\gcd(|g_1|, |g_2|) = 1$ ? If so, how? Of course, by ""classify"" I mean up to isomorphism. I have managed to prove that every finite nilpotent group works by using the fact that every finite nilpotent group is a product of $p$ -groups and by proving that the condition holds for all such products. I've included my proof of this at the end of the post. I can't come up with any other examples of groups that work. Since nilpotent groups are ""close to abelian,"" I wouldn't be surprised if these are the only ones. We could try to use the fact that a finite group is nilpotent if and only if two elements with coprime orders commute . This seems more plausible since this condition seems similar to the one here, but I don't really see how to do it. Am I on the right track here? I imagine we might be able to proceed a bit more directly using Sylow's theorems, but I'm not sure how. If we can prove that every Sylow subgroup of $G$ is normal, then it will follow that $G$ is nilpotent . (To be honest, I really don't know how to proceed. Any feedback or nudges would be very appreciated.) Here's my proof that finite products of finite $p$ -groups work. Let $G = G_1 \times \cdots \times G_n$ , where each $G_i$ is a finite group of order $p_i^{n_i}$ for some prime $p_i$ and some positive integer $n_i$ . Assume that the primes $p_1, \dots, p_n$ are distinct. Let's take two elements $g = (g_1, \dots, g_n)$ and $h = (h_1, \dots, h_n)$ of $G$ and assume that their orders are coprime. Each $g_i$ and $h_i$ is an element of a group of order $p_i^{n_i}$ , so they have orders $p_i^{a_i}$ and $p_i^{b_i}$ , respectively, for some non-negative integers $a_i,b_i$ . The order of $g$ is $$ |g| = \operatorname{lcm}(|g_1|, \dots, |g_n|) = \operatorname{lcm}(p_1^{a_1},\dots,p_n^{a_n}) = p_1^{a_1} \cdots p_n^{a_n}, $$ where the last equality uses the fact that the primes are distinct. It follows that $|g|$ and $|h|$ are coprime if and only if, for each $i$ , one of $a_i$ or $b_i$ is zero. Let's reorder the indices so that $a_1 = \cdots = a_j = b_{j+1} = \cdots = b_n = 0$ . Then $g_1, \dots, g_j, h_{j+1}, \dots, h_n$ are the identity elements of their respective groups, and it follows that $$ gh = (h_1,\dots,h_j,g_{j+1},\dots,g_n). $$ This implies that $$ |gh| = \operatorname{lcm}(p_1^{b_1}, \dots, p_j^{b_j}, p_{j+1}^{a_{j+1}}, \dots, p_n^{a_n}) = p_1^{b_1} \cdots p_j^{b_j} \cdot p_{j+1}^{a_{j+1}} \cdots p_n^{a_n} = |g| |h|, $$ and we are done.","It's well known that whenever and are commuting elements of a group with .
