THEOREM For each $n\in \Bbb N$, let $X_n$ be the discrete two-point topological space $\{0,2\}$. Define the product space $X=\prod\limits_{n\in \mathbb N}X_n\;$. Let $f:X\to [0,1]$ be defined as $$f(x)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{x(n)}{3^n}$$ Then $f$ is one-one and continuous. PROOF (Revised) We first prove $f$ is one-one. To this end, suppose we had $$\sum_{k\geqslant 1}\frac{x_n}{3^n}=0$$ with $x_n\in\{0,-2,2\}$. I claim first there cannot be any $K$ with $x_K=-2$. Indeed, let $K$ be the least index with $x_K=-2$. I claim that $x_k=0$ if $k<K$. Indeed, because $$ - \sum\limits_{k = K}^\infty  {\frac{2}{{{3^k}}}}  =  - \frac{1}{{{3^K}}}\sum\limits_{k = K}^\infty  {\frac{2}{{{3^{k - K}}}}}  =  - \frac{2}{{{3^K}}}\sum\limits_{k = 0}^\infty  {\frac{1}{{{3^k}}}}  =  - \frac{1}{{{3^K}}}$$ there is no way the sum would equal zero if some $x_k$ with $k<K$ was nonzero. But with this out of the way, it is impossible the sum is zero. By the same token, in the extreme case we have  $$ - \frac{2}{{{3^K}}} + \sum\limits_{k = K + 1}^\infty  {\frac{2}{{{3^k}}}}  =  - \frac{2}{{{3^K}}} + \frac{1}{{{3^{K + 1}}}} < 0$$ This means there cannot exist $k$ with $x_K=-2$. Thus $x_k\in \{0,2\}$. Since the sum is zero, all nonnegative terms must be zero, so the sequence is identically zero. We now prove $f$ is continuous. Let $a\in X$ and $\epsilon >0$ be given. The claim is that given the open ball $B(f(a);\epsilon)$, we can choose $k$ so that $$\tag 1 P_k=\bigcap_{i=1}^k p_i^{-1}(a(i))\subset f^{-1}(B)$$ where $p_i:X\to \{0,2\}$ is the projection to the $i$th coordinate. Since $f$ is one-one, $(1)$ is the same as $$f(P_k)\subset B$$ Note that for any point $x\in P_k$, the difference $|f(x)-f(a)|$ is at most $3^{-k}$, precisely when $x(n)=2$ and $a(n)=0$ for $n\geq k+1$ (or viceversa): $$\sum\limits_{n = k + 1}^{ + \infty } {\frac{2}{{{3^n}}}}  = \frac{1}{{{3^k}}}$$ Thus we may choose $k$ such that $3^{-k}<\epsilon$.

I think I understand everything except for how to prove exercise 1 on p. 4. For a bit of context, $\mathcal{F}_n$ is used to denote the space of complex polynomials (with leading coefficient equal to 1) without repeated roots. So a polynomial is of the form $z^n+a_{n-1}z^{n-1}+...+a_1z + a_0$ ; it is determined by the coefficients and so such polynomials may be regarded as a subset of $\mathbb{C}^n$ . The roots may be regarded as tuples in $\mathbb{C}^n$ . For example, if we take $n=2$ , we have some quadratics and there is a quadratic formula which gives us roots. However, if you move the coefficients in a large loop (so take a loop in $\mathcal{F}_2$ ) and keep track of the roots, it's possible to permute the roots. This means that the quadratic formula does not always map a loop of $\mathcal{F}_2$ to a loop in $\mathbb{C}^2$ . This is, of course, because square roots aren't really continuous functions on $\mathbb{C}$ . We need branch cuts and the theory of Riemann surfaces originates at this point.

I have recently stumbled upon this answer by user642796 which at the end lists all uncountable products of $\mathbb{R}$ as examples of non-sequential topological spaces. In a much more recent comment user Henno Brandsma says the following: $\mathbb{R}^\kappa$ is non-sequential if $\kappa \ge \mathfrak{c}$. I believe it is consistent that $\mathbb{R}^{\omega_1}$ is sequential, it depends on your set theory. So the last item [that uncountable products of $\mathbb{R}$ are non-sequential] is not fully correct.

Prove that there exists a clopen set $V$ such that $C\subset V\subset U$. I think I have a solution, but what I've ""proved"" is stronger: that $C$ must be itself clopen, so $C$ itself can function as the desired $V$. Attempt Let $\{C_{\alpha}\,|\,\alpha\in A\}$ be the collection of components in $X$. Since $X$ is normal (compact and Hausdorff implies normal) and each $C_{\alpha}$ is closed, we can find a collection of disjoint open sets $\mathcal{U}:=\{U_{\alpha}\,|\,\alpha\in A\}$ such that $C_{\alpha}\subseteq U_{\alpha}$ for each $\alpha\in A$. Now $\mathcal{U}$ is an open cover of $X$, so via compactness there exists a finite subcover, $\mathcal{U}_0=\{U_{\alpha_1},U_{\alpha_2},\ldots \}\subseteq\mathcal{U}$. It follows that there are finitely many components of $X$ and hence each component is open: given $C_{\alpha_i}$, we see that $$ X-C_{\alpha_i}=C_{\alpha_1}\cup\cdots\cup C_{\alpha_{i-1}}\cup C_{\alpha_{i+1}}\cup\cdots\cup C_{\alpha_n}, $$ which is the finite union of closed sets. Is this correct or have I made a grave mistake? If I've indeed made a mistake, could anyone point me in the right direction? Also, apologies for the frequent postings, I have a qualifying exam in a week and I've studying quite a lot lately. Edit 1: I should add that this is the second part of a two part question. The first part was showing that the components and quasi-components coincide.

A quick look at the cases for $T^1$ and $T^2$ : in the same constructions for $T^1$ and $T^2$ I believe the fundamental groups are $0$ and $\mathbb{Z}$ respectively and in the latter case, the image of one of the $S^1$ factors is the generator.
