We say that a function is integrable if its Dasboux sums (inferior and superior) coincide. This answer says that it's only valid to Riemann-Lebesgue integration, which is my case, but doesn't provr anything: If $\|f(x)-f(y)\|\ge \alpha\cdot\|x-y\|$ and $g$ integrable $\Longrightarrow$ $g\circ f:A \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is an integrable function Obviously this has something to do with the oscilation of $f$, becaue of the condition $|f(x)-f(y)|\ge c|x-y|$, and remember that $w(f,X) = \sup \{|f(x)-f(y)|; x,y\in X\}$ is the max variation seen in $f$ over the set $X$. So we have a case where the oscilation is $\ge |x-y|$. There are some theorems relating the oscilation of $f$ with its integrability.

18,Mistake with using residue theory for calculating $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\sin(x)}{x}dx$,Mistake with using residue theory for calculating,\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\sin(x)}{x}dx,"In physics, we do contour integrals in a not so rigorous way most of the times. Now, I want to use a trick to compute $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\sin(x)}{x}dx$$ using residue theory. I find: $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\sin(x)}{x}dx=2\pi$$which is clearly wrong since the correct value is $\pi$. I don't know what I am doing wrong here but I think it might have to do with using the residue theorem in a clumsy way. Any help in finding the mistake will be much appreciated. My solutions is the following(sorry if my notation(arguments) is too awkward(or not rigorous enough)): $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\sin(x)}{x}dx=Im\left[\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{e^{ix}}{x}dx\right]=Im\left[\lim_{ε\to0}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{e^{ix}}{x-iε}dx\right]$$ which has a residue just above $x=0$ on the complex plane.

So, we can now write: $$Im\left[\lim_{ε\to0}\int_{C2}\frac{e^{ix}}{x-iε}dx\right]=Im\left[\lim_{ε\to0}\int_{C1+C2}\frac{e^{ix}}{x-iε}dx\right]$$which is an integral along a closed path that encloses the pole(residue) at $x=iε$. So, I can use the residue theorem to find that the integral is equal to: $$Im[\lim_{ε\to0}2\pi i Res(e^{i(iε)})]=2\pi $$ which is clearly off by a factor of 2 .

96,Finding the double integral over a polar region,Finding the double integral over a polar region,,"I am not sure if I simplified wrong, and if I didn't, how would I go about integrating this? In the problem statement, the region is $$D = \Big\{(r,\theta) \mid 2\le r \le 3, \frac{\pi}{3} \le \theta \le \frac{2\pi}{3}\Big\},$$ and the function is $$f(x,y) = x^4+2x^2y^2+y^4.$$ So converting this to polar coordinates and setting up the double integral over the region I achieve $$ \int_{\frac{\pi}{3}}^{\frac{2\pi}{3}} \left(\int_{2}^{3}\left[r^4\cos^4(\theta)+2\left(r^2\cos^2(\theta)r^2\sin^2(\theta)\right)+r^4\sin^4(\theta)\right]r \;\mathrm{d}r \right) \mathrm{d}\theta$$ After all my simplifying through grouping and recognizing trig identities I can use I achieve $$\int_{\frac{\pi}{3}}^{\frac{2\pi}{3}} \left(\int_{2}^{3} r^5\left(\cos^4(\theta)+\sin^4(\theta)\right)+2r^3 \; \mathrm{d}r \right) \mathrm{d}\theta = \int_{\frac{\pi}{3}}^{\frac{2\pi}{3}} \left[\frac{665}{6}\left(\cos^4(\theta)+\sin^4(\theta)\right) + \frac{65}{2} \right]\mathrm{d}\theta.$$ I can easily integrate $\frac{65}{2}$ by itself, but how would I integrate the former with $\cos^4(\theta)+\sin^4(\theta)$ ? Obviously, I can pull the constant out and then split them up into two different integrals (and multiply the constant back after integrating both) but to integrate $\cos^4(\theta)$ and $\sin^4(\theta)$ doesn't seem like it would be pretty to do.

97,Why can we only integrate top forms?,Why can we only integrate top forms?,,"I understand some of the mechanics behind integration over manifolds, but I am lacking on some of the intuition. In Tu's An Introduction to Manifolds , when introducing integration of differential forms (Section 23.4), he says: Our approach to integration over a general manifold has several distinguishing features: The manifold must be oriented On a manifold of dimension $n$ , one can integrate only $n$ -forms, not functions The $n$ -forms must have compact support. My current understanding is that (1) is necessary to give a sign to the integral, just as we have in $\mathbb{R}^n$ . (3) is necessary to eliminate cases where the domain is infinite (for example, to rule out $\int_{-\infty}^\infty dx$ ). However, I am less certain about why (2) is necessary. In Lee's An Introduction to Smooth Manifolds , he gives some intuition about how top forms provide a way of measuring ""signed volume"" at each point of a manifold. Thus I see why they're useful in integration, but I don't see why this rules out integrating differential forms that are not top forms (including $0$ forms, i.e. functions).
