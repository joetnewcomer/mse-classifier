0,A metric space is complete when every closed and bounded subset of it is compact,A metric space is complete when every closed and bounded subset of it is compact,,"$X$ is a metric space such that every closed and bounded subset of $X$ is compact . Then $X$ is complete. Let $(x_{n})_{n}$ be a Cauchy sequence of $X$. Now every Cauchy sequence in a metric space is bounded. If $(x_{n})$ is convergent with limit, say, $x_{0}$, then $\{x_{n} : n \}\cup \{x_{0}\}$ is closed, otherwise the set $\{x_{n} : n \}$ is a closed set. If the sequence was convergent there was nothing to do. So when the sequence's convergent is not known, being closed and bounded, $\{x_{n} : n \}$ is a compact set. In metric spaces, compactness is equivalent to sequential compactness. Hence, the sequence $(x_{n})_n$ has a convergence subsequence $(x_{n_{k}})_k$ converging to, say, $x_{0}$. For being Cauchy, $(x_{n}$ also converges to $x_{0}$. Thus we see that every Cauchy sequence in $X$ is convergent . Hence $X$ is complete. Is my proof correct?

Which implication uses the maximality assumption? (b) Let $D \in \mathcal{D}$. Show that: $A \supset D \Rightarrow A \in \mathcal{D}$ (c) If $X$ is $T_1$ there is no more than one point in $\displaystyle \bigcap_{D \in \mathcal{D}} \overline{D}$ I think that the reverse implication of $(a)$ is straightforward. I am only worrying about the forward one, which I assume is the one that uses maximality. I have had no luck with the others. I realise that there is a conflict. In $(c)$ one must assume that $X$ is $T_1$ but that comes for free since we assume $X$ Hausdorff. Our professor told us that one should assume Hausdorff otherwise the statement is wrong, although he did not specify for which part. The book does not provide the Hausdorff condition.",,[]

Thank you for your comments, and happy new year !","My question is the following : Let $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ be a continuous map such as each irrational number is mapped to a rational number (i.e. $f(\mathbb{R}\backslash\mathbb{Q})\subset\mathbb{Q}$). Show that $f$ is a constant map. What I have done : Let's suppose that $f$ is not a constant map, i.e. it exists $x,y\in\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x)\neq f(y).$ As $f$ is continuous, the intermediate value theorem gives us that $[f(x),f(y)]\subset f([x,y]).$ But, as $$f([x,y])\subset f(\mathbb{R})=f(\mathbb{R}\backslash\mathbb{Q}\,\cup\,\mathbb{Q})=f(\mathbb{R}\backslash\mathbb{Q})\,\cup\,\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\{f(p_n)\}\subset\mathbb{Q}\,\cup\,\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\{f(p_n)\},$$ where $p_n$ is a sequence which describes $\mathbb{Q},$ we would get that $[f(x),f(y)]$ is a subset of a countable set and so is countable, which is a contradiction and so $f$ is constant. My questions : Is my proof correct, and if yes, does someone see an other way to answer it ?

The logic is simple and works for simple shapes of integer dimension.

Show that the closure of $\mathbb{Q}$ is $\mathbb{R}$. I'm new to topology, self-studying using the Munkres book.  In fact I'm new to proofs.  In the book he has just defined a closed set, and the notion of a closure of a set.  Here I attempt to do this proof.  I find it difficult not to appeal to things that seem 'obvious' in the course of a proof (I flag a couple of these points below).  But sometimes 'obvious' things are hard to prove indeed!  How can I improve my proof?  How would you prove it using only relatively elementary facts? Let us consider some irrational $x \in \mathbb{Q}'$.  For convenience, take $x>0$.  I intend to show that for any such $x$, there's no neighborhood of $x$ that does not intersect $\mathbb{Q}$, so all such $x$ have to be in the closure in question, $\bar{\mathbb{Q}}$ A minimal open set $U$ that contains $x$ is $(r_1, r_2)$ with $r_1<x<r_2$ and $r_1,r_2\in \mathbb{R}$.  But I shall show that no matter what we take for $r_1$ and $r_2$, $$r_1<r_2 \iff \exists q \in \mathbb{Q}: r_1<q<r_2$$ To begin, note $r_1 < r_2 \iff 0<r_2-r_1$. Let us define $\Delta r \equiv r_2 - r_1$ Consider $(\Delta r)^{-1}$ -- it could be large if $\Delta r$ is small, but certainly$^1$ $\exists z \in \mathbb{Z}_+:z>(\Delta r)^{-1}$ and this implies that ${1 \over z}<\Delta r$.  By definition, ${1 \over z} \in \mathbb{Q}$. Next consider $m {1 \over z}$ for $m \in \mathbb{Z}$.  If we take $m=0$, then $m {1\over z}<r_1$  (Otherwise we get $r_1 < 0 < r_2,$ and $0 \in \mathbb{Q}$). Also, if $m$ is large enough, then $m {1 \over z} > r_1$.  Let $M=\{0\} \cup \{m \in \mathbb{Z}_+:m {1 \over z}<r_1\}$.  Clearly $M$ is bounded by $zr_1$.  Take $n$ to be the largest element$^2$ of $M$.  Since $n \in M$, $n{1 \over z} < r_1$.  Also, $(n+1){1 \over z}>r_1$, since if not, $(n+1) \in M, (n+1)>n$ which contradicts that n is the largest element in $M$. Now  $$n{1 \over z} < r_1 \wedge {1 \over z} < r_2 - r_1 \implies n{1\over z} + {1 \over z} < r_1 + (r_2 - r_1) \\ \implies (n+1){1 \over z} < r_2$$ Therefore, we have that  $$ r_1 < {n+1 \over z} < r_2$$ But of course ${n + 1 \over z} \in \mathbb{Q}$ so this neighborhood of $x$ intersects $\mathbb{Q}$ no matter what interval $(r_1, r_2)$ containing $x$ we take, assuming $x$ is positive and irrational.  This means that all neighborhoods of positive irrational numbers intersect $\mathbb{Q}$.  I believe the argument for negative irrational numbers would go the same way without much different.  This would lead to all neighborhoods of positive and negative irrational numbers intersecting $\mathbb{Q}$, thus putting them in $\bar{\mathbb{Q}}$.

Define $\varphi$ to return the first point in the enumeration of the basic calls such that the ball contains no other points of $C$. $\varphi$ is a well-defined function on all subsets of $C$. It seems to me that $\varphi$ therefore is a choice function for $C$ and furthermore that it yields a enumeration of $C$. In the paper he sets $p_0 = \varphi (C)$ and then goes on to define families $\mathcal K$ of subsets of $C$ with the properties (i)   $\{p_0\} \in \mathcal K$ (ii) if $A_i$ in $\mathcal K$ then $\bigcup_i A_i \in \mathcal K$ (iii) if $E \subsetneq C$ is in $\mathcal K$  then $E \cup \varphi (C \setminus E)$ is also in $\mathcal K$. He uses $\mathcal K$ to give a proof that $C$ with the above property is enumerable without using the axiom of choice and without using transfinite induction. My question is: Does effective enumerability of $C$ not immediately   follow from the fact that $\varphi$ is a choice function for $C$ (via   transfinite induction)? I suspect I might be using some form of choice in my thoughts without being aware of it. Thanks for your help.",,"['general-topology', 'axiom-of-choice']"

A topological vector space is normable, i.e. its topology is induced by some norm on the vector space, if and only if it is Hausdorff and the $0$ vector has a bounded convex neighborhood.  My question is, under what circumstances is a topological vector space “inner product-able”, i.e. when is its topology induced by some inner product on the vector space? Note that this is not the same as asking under what circumstances a norm is induced by some inner product.  The answer to that question is when the norm obeys the parallelogram law.  But we could have a situation where the topology is induced by multiple norms, one which is not induced by any inner product and another which is induced by some inner product.
