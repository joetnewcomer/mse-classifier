0,Matrix function which is multiplicative and homogeneous of degree n is the determinant,Matrix function which is multiplicative and homogeneous of degree n is the determinant,,"I'm solving the following problem: Let $\Delta : M_n(\mathbb{F}) \to \mathbb{F}$ satisfy the following properties: $\Delta(AB) = \Delta(A)\Delta(B), \quad\forall A, B \in M_n(\mathbb{F})$ $\Delta(\lambda I) = \lambda^n, \quad\forall \lambda \in \mathbb{F}$ Prove that $\Delta = \det$. $M_n(\mathbb{F})$ is the space of $n\times n$ matrices with entries from the field $\mathbb{F}$, and $I \in M_n(\mathbb{F})$ is the identity matrix. $\mathbb{F}$ can pretty much be assumed to be $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$, since it was the general setting where the problem was given. $\DeclareMathOperator{\sgn}{sgn}$ The definition of the determinant I'm using is $\det A = \sum_{p\in S_n} \sgn p\cdot a_{1p(1)}a_{2p(2)}\cdots a_{np(n)}$, for $A = (a_{ij})$. I'm also aware of certain characterizations, such as: Let $f : M_n(\mathbb{F}) \to \mathbb{F}$ be a multilinear and alternating function in the columns of the matrix such that $f(I) = 1$. Then $f = \det$. My attempt: My idea was to prove that $\Delta = \det$ on all elementary matrices and then use the fact that every invertible matrix can be written as a product of elementary matrices. I would separately prove that $\Delta$ of all singular matrices is $0$. Some results I obtained along the way (using the notation for elementary matrices from the linked Wikipedia article): By plugging in $\lambda = 1$ in $(2)$ we get $\Delta(I) = 1$. $\lambda = 0$ gives $\Delta(0) = 0$. $\Delta$ is homogenous of degree $n$: By pluggin in $\lambda = 1$ in $(2)$ we get $\Delta(I) = 1$. Then for any matrix $A$ we have $\Delta(\lambda A) = \Delta(\lambda I\cdot A) = \Delta(\lambda I)\Delta(A) = \lambda^n \Delta(A)$. Let $A$ be invertible. Then $1 = \Delta(I) = \Delta(AA^{-1}) = \Delta(A)\Delta(A^{-1})$. Thus, $\Delta(A) \ne 0$. ${T_{i,j}}^2 = I$ so $|\Delta(T_{i,j})| = 1$ For $\lambda \notin \{0, 1\}$ we have $$\Delta(D_1(\lambda))\,\Delta(D_2(\lambda))\cdots \Delta(D_n(\lambda))) = \Delta(D_1(\lambda)\,D_2(\lambda)\cdots D_n(\lambda)) = \Delta(\lambda I) = \lambda^n$$ so there surely exists $i_0 \in \{1, \ldots, n\}$ such that $|\Delta(D_{i_0}(\lambda))|\ne 1$. $\Delta$ of a matrix with a zero row is $0$. Let $A$ be such that its $i$-th row is $0$. Then there exists a sequence of row transpositions $T_1, T_2, \ldots, T_k$ of the type $T_{r,s}$ such that $A$ is transformed to a matrix with its $i_0$-th row is a zero row, where $|\Delta(D_{i_0}(\lambda))|\ne 1$. Now, since multiplying that row with $\lambda \notin \{0, 1\}$ does not change the matrix, by doing the row transpositions again in reverse order we return to the matrix $A$. Then we have $$\Delta(A) = \Delta(T_1\ldots T_{n-1}T_nD_{i_0}(\lambda)T_n\ldots T_2T_1A) = \Delta(T_1)^2\Delta(T_2)^2\cdots\Delta(T_n)^2\Delta(D_{i_0}(\lambda))\Delta(A)$$ By taking the absolute value of both sides, since $|\Delta(T_{r,s})| = 1$ and $|\Delta(D_{i_0}(\lambda))|\ne 1$, we obtain $\Delta(A) = 0$. $\Delta$ of a singular matrix is $0$. Let $A$ be singular. Then $A$ can be transformed by row and column operations to a matrix $$E_r = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &  &  & & \\ & \ddots & & &  \\ & & 1 & & &  \\ & & & 0 & &  \\ & & & & \ddots \\ & & & & & 0 \\ \end{bmatrix}$$ with $r$ nonzero rows, where $r$ is the rank of $A$. Since $\Delta$ of elementary matrices is nonzero because they are invertible, and $\Delta(E_r) = 0$ because there is always a zero row in it, we can conclude that $\Delta(A) = 0$. $L_{i,j}(\lambda)$ can be diagonalized to $I$, and since $\Delta$ is obviously a similarity invariant we have $\Delta(L_{i,j}(\lambda)) = 1$. This is where I'm stuck, we still have to prove $\Delta(T_{i,j}) = -1$ and $\Delta(D_i(\lambda)) = \lambda$. I have had some further progress if we assume $\mathbb{F} = \mathbb{R}$: From $|\Delta(T_{i,j})| = 1$ we can conclude $\Delta(T_{i,j})$ = $\pm 1$. Notice that $D_i(\lambda) = T_{i,j}D_j(\lambda)$. Applying $\Delta$ we conclude that $\Delta(D_i(\lambda))$ and $\Delta(D_j(\lambda))$ can differ only by sign. Since we know $\Delta(D_1(\lambda))\,\Delta(D_2(\lambda))\cdots \Delta(D_n(\lambda))) = \lambda^n$, we get $|\Delta(D_i(\lambda))| = |\lambda|$. If we further assume $\lambda > 0$, we have $\Delta(D_i(\lambda)) = \Delta(D_i(\sqrt{\lambda})D_i(\sqrt{\lambda})) = \Delta\left(D_i(\sqrt{\lambda})\right)^2 > 0$. Finally we obtain $\Delta(D_i(\lambda)) = \lambda$.","I'm solving the following problem: Let $\Delta : M_n(\mathbb{F}) \to \mathbb{F}$ satisfy the following properties: $\Delta(AB) = \Delta(A)\Delta(B), \quad\forall A, B \in M_n(\mathbb{F})$ $\Delta(\lambda I) = \lambda^n, \quad\forall \lambda \in \mathbb{F}$ Prove that $\Delta = \det$. $M_n(\mathbb{F})$ is the space of $n\times n$ matrices with entries from the field $\mathbb{F}$, and $I \in M_n(\mathbb{F})$ is the identity matrix. $\mathbb{F}$ can pretty much be assumed to be $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$, since it was the general setting where the problem was given. $\DeclareMathOperator{\sgn}{sgn}$ The definition of the determinant I'm using is $\det A = \sum_{p\in S_n} \sgn p\cdot a_{1p(1)}a_{2p(2)}\cdots a_{np(n)}$, for $A = (a_{ij})$.

2,Generalizing Determinants Through Multilinear Algebra and Immanants,Generalizing Determinants Through Multilinear Algebra and Immanants,,"Let $V$ and $W$ be $n$-dimensional vector spaces (over $\mathbb{C}$ say) and $A: V\to W$ a linear map.

In the case $V=W$ then we have that $\det(A)$ is a scalar matching the traditional definition of a determinant. Naively, for a partition $\lambda$ of $n$ one is tempted to define the map $\det_{\lambda}(A): \mathbb{S}_\lambda(V)\to\mathbb{S}_\lambda(V)$ between the Schur functors of $V$ to be the map induced by $A$, which is not necessarily one-dimensional. However, we do have that $\det(A)=\det_{(1, \dots ,1)}(A)$. My first question is, is there any insight into these maps? Do they show up at all in the literature, or are they needless or ""incorrect"" generalizations? Since $\dim(\text{Sym}^n(V))\neq 1$ one immediate problem with this generalization is that it does not turn into the permanent by replacing the exterior powers with symmetric powers, regardless if we go so far as to use Schur functors or not. (Edit: But it is one-dimensional as a representation of $\mathfrak{S}_n$) Alternatively, there is the generalization of the determinant called the immanant given by \begin{equation*} \text{Imm}_{\lambda}(A)=\sum\limits_{\sigma\in\mathfrak{S}_n}\chi_{\lambda}(\sigma)a_{1\sigma(1)}\cdots a_{n\sigma(n)} \end{equation*} where $\chi_\lambda$ is the character of the irreducible representation of $\mathfrak{S}_n$ corresponding to the (conjugacy class corresponding to the) partition $\lambda$, which of course turns out to be $\mathbb{S}_\lambda(V)$. This definition is nice since for $\lambda=(1,\dots,1)$ it lines up with the determinant, and for $\lambda=(n)$ it lines up with the permanent.

I have already asked a (viewed but unanswered) question about the same matrices ( cf. here ), but the question here is different. First, let's define two matrices: $\mathbf{N}$ is the following matrix: \begin{equation} \mathbf{N}=\begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{I}_n & \mathbf{0}_n \\  \mathbf{0}_n & \mathbf{P}^{-1}\begin{bmatrix}1 & && \\ & \ddots && \\ & & 1& \\ &&& -1 \end{bmatrix}\mathbf{P}  \end{bmatrix}\in\mathbb{R}^{2n\times2n} \end{equation} where $\mathbf{P}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ is any invertible matrix. with $\omega_i>0$ and $t>0$, the block-diagonal matrix: \begin{equation} \mathbf{S}(t)=\begin{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\omega_1t) & \\& \ddots & \\ & & \cos(\omega_n t) \end{bmatrix} & \begin{bmatrix} \dfrac{\sin(\omega_1t)}{\omega_1} & \\& \ddots & \\ & & \dfrac{\sin(\omega_nt)}{\omega_n} \end{bmatrix} \\ \begin{bmatrix}  -\omega_1 \sin(\omega_1t) & \\& \ddots & \\ & & -\omega_n\sin(\omega_n t) \end{bmatrix} &  \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\omega_1t) & \\& \ddots & \\ & & \cos(\omega_n t) \end{bmatrix}\end{bmatrix}\in\mathbb{R}^{2n\times2n} \end{equation} The eigenvalues of $\mathbf N$ are of course 1 (multiplicity $2n-1$) and $-1$ (multiplicity $1$). The eigenvalues of $\mathbf{S}(t)$, which is an exponential matrix, are the $n$ couples of the complex conjugates $(\exp(i\omega_jt),\overline{\exp(i\omega_jt)})$. Now, we can define $\forall t>0$, $\mathbf{A}(t)=\mathbf N\mathbf S(t)$. We know that the product of the eigenvalues of $\mathbf{A}(t)$ is the product of those of $\mathbf{N}$ and $\mathbf S(t)$, i.e. $-1$. I observe an interesting property but can't prove where it stems from: $1$ and $-1$ are eigenvalues of  $\mathbf{A}(t)$ ($\forall t$); $1$ and $-1$ are $\color{red}{\text{not}}$  eigenvalues of  $\mathbf{A}(t_2)\mathbf{A}(t)$ ($\forall t,t_2$, except maybe for specific values of $\mathbf P$ and $\omega_k$); $1$ and $-1$ are eigenvalues of  $\mathbf{A}(t_3)\mathbf{A}(t_2)\mathbf{A}(t)$ ($\forall t,t_2,t_3$); $1$ and $-1$ are $\color{red}{\text{not}}$  eigenvalues of  $\mathbf{A}(t_4)\mathbf{A}(t_3)\mathbf{A}(t_2)\mathbf{A}(t)$ ($\forall t,t_2,t_3,t_4$, except maybe for specific values of $\mathbf P$ and $\omega_k$); $\dots$ I managed to prove $1$ and $-1$ are eigenvalues of  $\mathbf{A}(t)$ by considering $\mathbf{S}(t)\pm\operatorname{diag}(1,\dots,1,-1,\dots,1)$, calculating its kernel, and building the appropriate vectors (without having to calculate them explicitly ). Also, I understand that the product of the eigenvalues of $\mathbf{A}(t_2)\mathbf{A}(t)$ is 1, while that of $\mathbf{A}(t_3)\mathbf{A}(t_2)\mathbf{A}(t)$ is -1, but that does not prove anything. Questions 1) Any suggestion to prove the framed observation would be very welcome: why are apparently 1 and -1 eigenvalues of $\prod_{i=1}^m A(t_i)$ if and only if $m$ is odd? 2) Also, I have the impression that there exists a powerful mathematical framework to study these matrices, but I can't figure out which one, as not being a mathematician; Lie algebra because $\mathbf S(t)$ is an exponential?

This norm is an $L_2$ norm, but what we really want is an $L_0$ norm, since we want to minimize the number of non-zero elements in the matrix.

Now, the points are like 1  2                 3 This looks like the camera is farther back from the paper and was lowered, say at location $(0, -100, 50)$.

I want to find an error in a proof of this statement. I've found great proofs of this in the literature, for example these notes and this book . They all have the same core of the proof: take a linear form $\varphi_i: V\to \mathbb{F}$ such that $\varphi_i(v_j)=\delta_{ij}$ , which exists thanks to independence of $\{v_i\}$ . Then we have a linear function $\phi_i : V\otimes W \to W$ given by $\phi_i(v\otimes w)= \varphi_i(v)w$ which is as close to projection $V\otimes W \to W$ as one can hope to get.

By the universal property, there is a linear function $\varphi: V\otimes W \to F$ such that $\varphi(v_i\otimes w_j)=\Phi(v_i,w_j)=(v_i,w_j)$ . We see that it is an isomorphism, because we can define $\phi^{-1}$ on a basis: $$\phi^{-1}((v_i,w_j))=v_i\otimes w_j$$ which is clearly a linear inverse. Therefore $F$ is isomorphic to $V\otimes W$ , so if $\{(v_i,w_j)\}$ is a basis for $F$ , $\phi[\{(v_i,w_j)\}] = \{v_i\otimes w_j\}$ must also be a basis.

52,"Finite group of ""linear substitutions""","Finite group of ""linear substitutions""",,"From what I can tell, a linear substitution is an operation on a set of variables $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ which sends them to a new set of variables $y_1,\ldots, y_n$ via a linear transformation $$\vec{y} = \mathbf{A}\vec{x}$$ Provided the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is invertible, the transformation $\vec{x}\rightarrow \vec{y}$ is invertible. Because these linear substitutions are composable, invertible, and have unit, it is possible to form group structures out of them. In a paper, Painlevé considers an arbitrary group $\alpha$ of linear substitutions for two variables. From what I understand, Painlevé asks us to consider a pair of functions $\varphi$ and $\psi$ which constitute an invariant with respect to the group operation; that is to say, $$\langle x, y\rangle =\langle \varphi(t,u), \psi(t,u)\rangle$$ and whenever $\langle T, U\rangle$ are a solution to this equation, the complete set of solutions is exactly obtained by applying all the transformations in the group $\alpha$ to $T$ and $U$:  $\{ f(T,U) : f\in \alpha\}$. I am mystified, however, when Painlevé subsequently treats $t$ and $u$ as functions of $x$ and $y$, forming all second-order partial derivatives of $$ \begin{align*} t(aT + bU + c) = a^\prime T + b^\prime U + c^\prime\\ u(aT + bU + c) = a^{\prime\prime} T + b^{\prime\prime}U + c^{\prime\prime}\\ \end{align*} $$ My questions are: Where did these equations come from? How is it that we treat $t$ and $u$ as functions of $x$ and $y$? Why are there constant terms $c$? (Surely a ""linear substitution"" cannot include constant terms or else the transformation wouldn't be invertible?) What does it mean to call $\langle \phi, \psi\rangle$ invariants? They look like a description of an arbitrary member $f\in \alpha$. Perhaps something was lost in translation? The relevant excerpt, in French (which I don't speak), is included below: I surmise that it says something like: Consider a finite group $\alpha$ of linear substitutions involving two variables and two fundamental invariant functions which correspond to them: $$x=\phi(t,u),\qquad y=\psi(t,u);$$   If, for a system $(x,y)$, the values $(T,U)$ satisfy the equations (1), all the other solutions of these equations are obtained by applying to the values $(T,U)$ all of the substitutions in the group $\alpha$. We differentiate the equations $$ \begin{align*} t(aT + bU + c) = a^\prime T + b^\prime U + c^\prime\\ u(aT + bU + c) = a^{\prime\prime} T + b^{\prime\prime}U + c^{\prime\prime}\\ \end{align*} $$ with respect to $x$ and $y$ up to second order, inclusive. In this way, we form twelve equations [i.e. $\partial_x, \partial_y, \partial_{xx}, \partial_{xy}, \partial_{yx}, \partial_{yy}$ for the two equations?], homogeneous and linear in $a$, $b$, $c$, $a^\prime$, ...., and, if we eliminate those constants, the remaining four equations involve partial derivatives (first and second) of $t$ and of $u$. I discovered that in Transformations of the fundamental equations of thermodynamics , Buckley describes a similar kind of (reversible differentiable but not necessarily linear?) substitution which might shed light on this one. To paraphrase: Suppose the state of a physical system can be described by variables $x_1,\ldots x_n$. Then there exists a characteristic function $E$, which is the solution of a particular exact differential equation $$\partial E - \sum_i x_i\,dx_i = 0,$$ such that the behavior of the system in any state can be conveniently described in terms of $E$ and its partial derivatives with respect to the variables $x_1,\ldots, x_n$.  Specifically, in thermodynamics, we can use the state variables volume $V$ and entropy $S$; all general thermodynamic formulas are derivable from $E$ and the basic equations     $$\begin{align*}H &\equiv E - V\, \partial_V E\\ F &\equiv E - S\partial_S E\\G &\equiv E - V\,\partial_V E - S\partial_S E = H-F+E\end{align*}$$ ""Legitimate operations"" (?) on these equations generate a collection $C$ of thermodynamic formulas which are valid with respect to the state variables $V, S$. If we change variables $\mathbf{\mathsf t}:(V,S)\mapsto (V^\prime, S^\prime)$, the new variables \begin{align*}V^\prime = \varphi(V)\\S^\prime = \psi(S)\\\end{align*} are functionally independent and hence soluble for the originals. Under this change of variables, the functions $EHFG$ and formulas $C$ will, generally speaking, change form, but they must remain identically true. Suppose, however, that the functions $EHFG$ retain the same form under a particular change of variables. Then the formulas $C$ must also retain the same form. If the collection of all such transformations forms a group $\mathsf{G}$, then the fundamental formulas will remain unchanged under $\mathsf{G}$, and hence the group characterizes a fundamental arbitrariness in the thermodynamic description of all systems. This is analogous to the fact that, in relativity, the description of the laws of electromagnetic radiation remain unchanged under a Lorentz(-Einstein) transform. But I guess I still don't understand formally what it means to say that an equation has ""the same form"" under a transformation $T$, e.g. expressed as a composition of functions. Perhaps it means that unlike in the general case where of course a change of variables doesn't affect the equation $$(f\circ T^{-1})[T(x)] = (g\circ T^{-1})[T(x)]\;\iff\; f(x) = g(x),$$ a change of variables has the same functional form if not only that, but also (?): $$f(T(x)) = g(T(x)) \iff f(x) = g(x)$$","From what I can tell, a linear substitution is an operation on a set of variables $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ which sends them to a new set of variables $y_1,\ldots, y_n$ via a linear transformation $$\vec{y} = \mathbf{A}\vec{x}$$ Provided the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is invertible, the transformation $\vec{x}\rightarrow \vec{y}$ is invertible. Because these linear substitutions are composable, invertible, and have unit, it is possible to form group structures out of them. In a paper, Painlevé considers an arbitrary group $\alpha$ of linear substitutions for two variables. From what I understand, Painlevé asks us to consider a pair of functions $\varphi$ and $\psi$ which constitute an invariant with respect to the group operation; that is to say, $$\langle x, y\rangle =\langle \varphi(t,u), \psi(t,u)\rangle$$ and whenever $\langle T, U\rangle$ are a solution to this equation, the complete set of solutions is exactly obtained by applying all the transformations in the group $\alpha$ to $T$ and $U$:  $\{ f(T,U) : f\in \alpha\}$. I am mystified, however, when Painlevé subsequently treats $t$ and $u$ as functions of $x$ and $y$, forming all second-order partial derivatives of $$ \begin{align*} t(aT + bU + c) = a^\prime T + b^\prime U + c^\prime\\ u(aT + bU + c) = a^{\prime\prime} T + b^{\prime\prime}U + c^{\prime\prime}\\ \end{align*} $$ My questions are: Where did these equations come from? How is it that we treat $t$ and $u$ as functions of $x$ and $y$? Why are there constant terms $c$? (Surely a ""linear substitution"" cannot include constant terms or else the transformation wouldn't be invertible?) What does it mean to call $\langle \phi, \psi\rangle$ invariants? They look like a description of an arbitrary member $f\in \alpha$. Perhaps something was lost in translation? The relevant excerpt, in French (which I don't speak), is included below: I surmise that it says something like: Consider a finite group $\alpha$ of linear substitutions involving two variables and two fundamental invariant functions which correspond to them: $$x=\phi(t,u),\qquad y=\psi(t,u);$$   If, for a system $(x,y)$, the values $(T,U)$ satisfy the equations (1), all the other solutions of these equations are obtained by applying to the values $(T,U)$ all of the substitutions in the group $\alpha$. We differentiate the equations $$ \begin{align*} t(aT + bU + c) = a^\prime T + b^\prime U + c^\prime\\ u(aT + bU + c) = a^{\prime\prime} T + b^{\prime\prime}U + c^{\prime\prime}\\ \end{align*} $$ with respect to $x$ and $y$ up to second order, inclusive. In this way, we form twelve equations [i.e. $\partial_x, \partial_y, \partial_{xx}, \partial_{xy}, \partial_{yx}, \partial_{yy}$ for the two equations?], homogeneous and linear in $a$, $b$, $c$, $a^\prime$, ...., and, if we eliminate those constants, the remaining four equations involve partial derivatives (first and second) of $t$ and of $u$. I discovered that in Transformations of the fundamental equations of thermodynamics , Buckley describes a similar kind of (reversible differentiable but not necessarily linear?) substitution which might shed light on this one. To paraphrase: Suppose the state of a physical system can be described by variables $x_1,\ldots x_n$. Then there exists a characteristic function $E$, which is the solution of a particular exact differential equation $$\partial E - \sum_i x_i\,dx_i = 0,$$ such that the behavior of the system in any state can be conveniently described in terms of $E$ and its partial derivatives with respect to the variables $x_1,\ldots, x_n$.  Specifically, in thermodynamics, we can use the state variables volume $V$ and entropy $S$; all general thermodynamic formulas are derivable from $E$ and the basic equations     $$\begin{align*}H &\equiv E - V\, \partial_V E\\ F &\equiv E - S\partial_S E\\G &\equiv E - V\,\partial_V E - S\partial_S E = H-F+E\end{align*}$$ ""Legitimate operations"" (?) on these equations generate a collection $C$ of thermodynamic formulas which are valid with respect to the state variables $V, S$. If we change variables $\mathbf{\mathsf t}:(V,S)\mapsto (V^\prime, S^\prime)$, the new variables \begin{align*}V^\prime = \varphi(V)\\S^\prime = \psi(S)\\\end{align*} are functionally independent and hence soluble for the originals. Under this change of variables, the functions $EHFG$ and formulas $C$ will, generally speaking, change form, but they must remain identically true. Suppose, however, that the functions $EHFG$ retain the same form under a particular change of variables. Then the formulas $C$ must also retain the same form. If the collection of all such transformations forms a group $\mathsf{G}$, then the fundamental formulas will remain unchanged under $\mathsf{G}$, and hence the group characterizes a fundamental arbitrariness in the thermodynamic description of all systems.

And my textbook says vector space $\mathbb{R}^2$ is not a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^3$ but let say $V=\begin{pmatrix}a\\b\end{pmatrix}$ and $W=\begin{pmatrix}c\\d\end{pmatrix}$, so $V$ and $W$ are all in $\mathbb{R}^2$, and clearly $V+W$ is in $\mathbb{R}^2$, $cV$ or $cW$ is in $\mathbb{R}^2$ too, so the first two requirements are met, why we say $\mathbb{R}^2$ is not a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^3$?

The question reads: Let $V$ be the vector space of functions on the interval $[0, 1]$. Prove that the functions $x^{3}$, $\sin(x)$, and $\cos(x)$ are linearly independent.
