1,Showing that $ae^x=1+x+\frac{x^2}{2}$ has exactly one real root (part 2),Showing that  has exactly one real root (part 2),ae^x=1+x+\frac{x^2}{2},"I made this question here Show $a e^x=1+x+\frac{x^2}{2}$ has exactly one real root but I wrote the equation wrong. I reproduce the post with the correct equation: I'm struggling with the following problem: Show that the equation $a e^x=1+x+\frac{x^2}2$, where $a$ is a positive constant, has exactly one real root. Looking at the graphs of both $ae^x$ and $1+x+\frac{x^2}2$, they will intersect on the left half of the plane when $a>1$ and on the right half when $a<1$ (because a makes $e^x$ grow faster or slower). So if I could find a point $x_1$ where $a e^{x_1}-(1+x_1+\frac{{x_1}^{2}}2)<0$ and a point $x_2$ where $a e^{x_2}-(1+x_2+\frac{{x_2}^2}2)>0$, by the intermediate value theorem, the equation would have a real root. Also,since the derivative of $a e^x-(1+x+\frac{x^2}2)$ is always positive, I could colclude that there can't exist another real root. So my question is, how can I find $x_1$ and $x_2$? I can't figure out how to express $x$ in terms of $a$.","I made this question here Show $a e^x=1+x+\frac{x^2}{2}$ has exactly one real root but I wrote the equation wrong.

I have an exercise where I have basically to say if some series are convergent or divergent. If convergent, determine (and prove) the sum of the series. This is the first series: $$\sum_{i=0}^n \frac{4}{3^i}$$ I have heard about the ratio test , so I decided to try to apply it in this case to see if the series is or not convergent. The ratio test is basically defined like this: $$L = \lim{\left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\right|}$$ Where $a_n$ is in this case $\frac{4}{3^n}$ and $a_{n+1}$ is consequently $\frac{4}{3^{n+1}}$. Thus, we have: $$L = \lim{\left|\frac{\frac{4}{3^{n+1}}}{\frac{4}{3^n}}\right|} = \lim{\left|\frac{4 \cdot 3^n}{3^{n+1} \cdot 4}\right|} = \lim{\left|\frac{3^n}{3^{n+1}}\right|} = \lim{\left|\frac{3^n}{3^n\cdot 3}\right|} = \lim{\left|\frac{1}{3}\right|} = \frac{1}{3} < 1$$ From the ratio test , we know if $L< 1$, then the series converges. Now, I need to find the sum. I have followed a video which explain how to find the sum using the ratio , which sincerely I have not understand well what it is. Can you explain a general rule to find the ratio, and what exactly is it? Ok. So, following the same process done during the video, I have: $$\sum_{i=0}^n \frac{4}{3^n} = 4 \sum_{i=0}^n \frac{1}{3^n} = 4 \sum_{i=0}^n \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^n$$ Apparently, our ratio $r$ is $\frac{1}{3}$. Now, to find the sum of the series, he uses a formula: $$\frac{\text{first term}}{1 - r}$$ Where first term is the first term of the series. Can you explain where this formula comes from? Applying that formula, we obtain: $$\frac{\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^0}{1 - \frac{1}{3}} = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{3}} = \frac{1}{\frac{2}{3}} = \frac{3}{2}$$ I checked the sum using a online calculator, and apparently it is not $\frac{3}{2}$, so I decided to manipulate, and I thought I left a $4$ outside the series, so I multiply that $4$ by $\frac{3}{2}$, which produces $\frac{12}{2} = 6$, which is exactly the sum I found using 2 online calculators. Now, my 3rd question is: why what I did is correct (or not correct)?","I a newbie to series, and I have not done too much yet.

So, following the same process done during the video, I have: $$\sum_{i=0}^n \frac{4}{3^n} = 4 \sum_{i=0}^n \frac{1}{3^n} = 4 \sum_{i=0}^n \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^n$$ Apparently, our ratio $r$ is $\frac{1}{3}$. Now, to find the sum of the series, he uses a formula: $$\frac{\text{first term}}{1 - r}$$ Where first term is the first term of the series. Can you explain where this formula comes from? Applying that formula, we obtain: $$\frac{\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^0}{1 - \frac{1}{3}} = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{3}} = \frac{1}{\frac{2}{3}} = \frac{3}{2}$$ I checked the sum using a online calculator, and apparently it is not $\frac{3}{2}$, so I decided to manipulate, and I thought I left a $4$ outside the series, so I multiply that $4$ by $\frac{3}{2}$, which produces $\frac{12}{2} = 6$, which is exactly the sum I found using 2 online calculators. Now, my 3rd question is: why what I did is correct (or not correct)?",,"['calculus', 'sequences-and-series']"
