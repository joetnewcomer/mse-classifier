5,Some inequalities involving binomial coefficients in Erdös' Graph Theory and Probability,Some inequalities involving binomial coefficients in Erdös' Graph Theory and Probability,,"Let $n$ be a (sufficiently large) positive integer, and $k$ be a fixed positive integer. Let $0 < \epsilon < \frac{1}{k}$ and $0 < \eta < \epsilon / 2$ be arbitrary. Define $m = \lfloor n^{1 + \epsilon} \rfloor$ and $p = \lfloor n^{1 - \eta} \rfloor$ . I am working on the result from Erdös' Graph Theory and Probability that for any $k$ and $r$ there exists a graph with no cycles of length $\leq k$ and chromatic number $> r$ using the probabilistic method. It seems many modern treatments are more explicitly probabilistic, but I would like to understand a bit more of the classic techniques used. In particular, I would like some help in understanding the following two inequalities from (p35), which I cannot get: $$ (n + 1) \binom{\binom{p}{2}}{n} \binom{\binom{n}{2} - \binom{p}{2}}{m} < p^{2n} \binom{\binom{n}{2} - \binom{m}{2}}{m} < \binom{\binom{n}{2}}{m} p^{2n} \left( 1 - \frac{\binom{p}{2}}{\binom{n}{2}} \right)^{m} . $$ If anyone might be able to share some hints or tricks for dealing with these binomial coefficients, that would be really helpful. Attempt: A basic inequality that I believe might be useful is $\frac{n^k}{k^k} \leq \binom{n}{k} \leq \frac{n^k}{k!}$ . This seems to get some promising results, but I can't seem to pushit through to get the whole desired result, so I am probably missing some key steps. For the first inequality, $\binom{p}{2} \leq \frac{p^2}{2}$ , so we have $\binom{\binom{p}{2}}{n} \leq \frac{p^{2n}}{2^n n!} \leq p^{2n}$ . So this gives one part of it. But I am unsure how the $(n+1)$ (and perhaps the $\frac{1}{2^n n!}$ part) can be used to change the upper index of the binomial coefficient. Note that $\binom{n}{2} - \binom{p}{2} > \binom{n}{2} - \binom{m}{2}$ . For the second inequality, I have tried to use $\binom{\binom{n}{2} - \binom{m}{2}}{m} \leq \frac{\left[\binom{n}{2} - \binom{m}{2}\right]^m}{m!} \leq \frac{\left[\binom{n}{2} - \binom{p}{2}\right]^m}{m!}$ . If I use the $1/m!$ term to create the first binomial coefficient, I can write $\frac{1}{m!} = \frac{\binom{n}{2}!}{m! \left(\binom{n}{2} - m\right)!} \frac{\left(\binom{n}{2} - m\right)!}{\binom{n}{2}!} = \binom{\binom{n}{2}}{m} \frac{\left(\binom{n}{2} - m\right)!}{\binom{n}{2}!}$ . So far so good, but then I can only get $\frac{\left(\binom{n}{2} - m\right)!}{\binom{n}{2}!} \leq \frac{1}{\left[\binom{n}{2} - m\right]^m}$ , whereas I want the upper bound to be $\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}^m}$ .","Let be a (sufficiently large) positive integer, and be a fixed positive integer.

6,Learning to prove equality of sets and their cardinality,Learning to prove equality of sets and their cardinality,,"On $\mathbb R^2$ , define $(x_1, y_1) \sim (x_2, y_2) \iff x^2_1 + y^2_1 = x^2_2 + y^2_2$ . Find a transversal for $\sim$ and prove your answer. Partial answer: The equivalence class of a point $(a,b) \in \mathbb R^2$ is given by $[(a,b)] = \{(x,y): x^2 + y^2 = a^2 + b^2 \}$ meaning  the equivalence classes are concentric circles centered at the origin in $\mathbb R^2$ . One possible transversal is $S = \{(0,r): r \ge 0\}$ -- set of representatives from distinct concentric circles. Another possibility for transversal is to choose any ray from the origin, fix a nonzero point $(a,b) \in \mathbb R^2$ and obtain a transversal $\{(ra,rb) \in \mathbb R^2: r \ge 0\}$ . To prove this, we wanna show $\mathbb R^2 = \bigcup_{r\ge0}[(0, r)] = \bigcup_{r\ge0}[(ra, rb)].$ I want to try proving equality of the given sets. So, Suppose $(x, y) \in \bigcup_{r\ge0}[(0, r)].$ Then $(x, y) \in [(0, r)]$ for some $r \ge 0.$ Then $(x, y) \sim (0, r) \iff x^2 + y^2 = 0^2 + r^2 = r^2$ for some $r \ge 0.$ Now $[(ra,rb)] = \{(x,y): x^2 + y^2 =r^2(a^2 + b^2) \}$ for some $(a, b) \in \mathbb R^2$ . In particular, $[(ra,rb)] = \{(x,y): x^2 + y^2 =r^2 \}$ for $(a, b) = (0, 1)$ meaning $(x, y) \in [(ra,rb)]$ for some $r \ge 0$ and some $(a, b) \in \mathbb R^2$ and so $(x, y) \in \bigcup_{r\ge0}[(ra, rb)]$ which proves $\bigcup_{r\ge0}[(0, r)] \subseteq \bigcup_{r\ge0}[(ra, rb)].$ The other direction is very similar. Assume $(x, y) \in \mathbb R^2$ . Then $x, y \in \mathbb R$ for all $x, y$ . In particular, $y = r$ for some $r \ge 0$ and so $(x, y) = (0, r)$ for some $r \ge 0$ meaning $(x, y) \in \bigcup_{r\ge0}[(0, r)]$ and so $\mathbb R^2 \subseteq \bigcup_{r\ge0}[(0, r)]$ . The other direction is very similar. Since equality is transitive, we have $\mathbb R^2 = \bigcup_{r\ge0}[(ra, rb)].$ Just for practice I will try showing $|\mathbb R^2| = |\bigcup_{r\ge0}[(0, r)]|.$ Assume $(x, y) \in \mathbb R^2$ and consider $f: \mathbb R^2 \to \bigcup_{r\ge0}[(0, r)]$ as $f(x, y) = (0, r)$ for some $r\ge 0.$ Suppose $f(x_1, y_1) = f(x_2, y_2) \iff (0, r_1) = (0, r_2)$ . Since ordered pairs are equal iff the corresponding first components are equal and second components are equal, we have $r_1 = r_2$ . Thus $(x_1, y_1) = (x_2, y_2)$ meaning $f$ is injective. Since $r$ is real, for any $(0, r) \in \bigcup_{r\ge0}[(0, r)]$ , we can find some $y \in \mathbb R$ s.t. $y = r.$ Also, $(0, y) \in \mathbb R^2$ for any real $y$ . Thus there's some $(x, y) \in \mathbb R^2$ s.t. $f(x, y) = (0, r)$ for any $(0, r) \in \bigcup_{r\ge0}[(0, r)]$ meaning $f$ is surjective. Do the proofs above work? If not, what are some alteratives?

Suppose $A=\{x\in\mathbb N:P(x)\text{ is false.}\}$ is non-empty, then let $m$ be its least element. Since $P(0)$ is true, $m\neq 0$ . Therefore, there must be some $n$ such that $m=n^+$ .

A helpful reference I found is Xuan Cai: Canonical Coin Systems for Change-Making Problems , in which neccesary and sufficient conditions are given for, among others, the case for coin systems with five coins. However, I am getting conflicting results when following these conditions in the paper, likely owing to my own misunderstanding. Here is the relevant theorem: Theorem 9: A coin system $\$=<1,c_2,c_3,c_4,c_5>$ is non-canonical if   and only if $\$$ satisfies exactly one of the following conditions: 1) $\$=<1,c_2,c_3>$ is non-canonical. 2) $\$ \ne <1,2,c_3,c_3+1,2c_3>$ . 3) $\lvert GRD_{\$}((k+1) \cdot c_4)\rvert > k+1$ with $k \cdot c_4<c_5<(k+1) \cdot c_4$ . The way to check if a coin system with three coins is non-canonical is provided by Theorem 4: Theorem 4: The coin system $=<1,c_2,c_3>$ is non-canonical if and only if $0<r<c_2-q$ where $c_3=qc_2+r$ and $r \in [0, c_2-1]$ . Here are two examples of coin systems checked with Theorem 9. 1) $\$_1=<1,5,10,20,50>$ . First we check $<1,5,10>$ by Theorem 4. We see that $10=2 \cdot 5 + 0$ , giving $r = 0$ , and $q = 2$ . Thus $0 \nless r$ , so $<1,5,10>$ is canonical , and so $\$_1$ does not meet the first condition. Next, we check that $\$_1 \ne <1,2,c_3,c_3+1,2c_3> = <1,2,10,11,20>$ , which is true. Thus, $\$_1$ does meet the second condition. Finally, we check the third condition. We find $k=2$ satisfies $2 \cdot 20 < 50 < 3 \cdot 20$ , and so we find $GRD_{\$_1}(3 \cdot 20 = 60) = 50+10$ . Thus, $\lvert GRD_{\$_1}(60)\rvert = 2$ , as two coins are used. Thus $2 \ngtr 3$ , and so $\$_1$ does not meet the third condition. In conclusion, $\$_1$ meets exactly one of the three conditions, condition 2), and so, by Theorem 9, $\$_1$ is non-canonical . However, we know this is not true, as $\$_1 = \$_{US}$ from above, a system known to be canonical. 2) $\$_2=<1,3,4,20,50>$ . First we check $<1,3,4>$ by Theorem 4. We see that $4=1 \cdot 3 + 1$ , giving $r = 1$ , and $q = 1$ . Thus $0 < r < 2$ , so $<1,3,4>$ is non-canonical , and so $\$_2$ does meet the first condition. Next, we check that $\$_2 \ne <1,2,c_3,c_3+1,2c_3> = <1,2,4,5,8>$ , which is true. Thus, $\$_2$ does meet the second condition. Finally, we check the third condition. We find $k=2$ satisfies $2 \cdot 20 < 50 < 3 \cdot 20$ , and so we find $GRD_{\$_1}(3 \cdot 20 = 60) = 50+4+4+1+1$ . Thus, $\lvert GRD_{\$_1}(60)\rvert = 5$ , as five coins are used. Thus $5 > 3$ , and so $\$_2$ does meet the third condition. In conclusion, $\$_2$ meets not exactly one but all three conditions, and so, by Theorem 9, $\$_2$ is canonical . However, we know this is not true, as $\$_2 = \$_{NC}$ from above, a system known to be non-canonical. Either I am misinterpreting Theorem 9, or a (likely) small correction should be made in the paper. Can anyone see either where I am wrong, or how Theorem 9 should be fixed? My hunch is that the second condition should read $\$ = <1,2,c_3,c_3+1,2c_3>$ , and the wording of Theorem 9 should be ""...is non-canonical if and only if $\$$ satisfies at least one of the following conditions"". That way, our two examples would be consistent with their known canonicality.","I need to check whether a given coin system of five coins, , is canonical , that is, a system in which the greedy algorithm provides the way to make change using the fewest number of coins.

59,Simpler solution for EGMO 2018 Problem 3?,Simpler solution for EGMO 2018 Problem 3?,,"This is a reformulation of problem number 3 from the 2018 European Girls Math Olympiad .  It took me several days to come up with a complete solution, and I'm wondering if there is an easier way. Consider a solitaire game with $n$ cards, labeled $1$ though $n$.  The cards are shuffled and placed in a line, face up..  If the card labeled $k$ has at least $k$ cards to its left, you are allowed to jump it $k$ places to the left, inserting it into the line.  There are no other legal moves. For example, if $n=7,$ and the layout is $2753146,$ you can jump the $3$, giving $3275146,$ or the $1,$ giving $2751346,$ or the $4$, giving $2475316,$ or the $6,$ giving $6275314.$ The problem is: 1) Show that the game cannot go on forever.  Eventually, you must reach a position in which no moves are possible. 2) What is the maximum possible number of jumps in a game with $n$ cards, if the initial position is as advantageous as possible, and you make the best moves? We have to do three things: 1) Prove that the game cannot last forever. 2) Establish an upper bound on the number of jumps. 3) Construct a game with the maximum number of jumps. Early on, I decided that the maximum number of jumps is $2^n-(n+1).$  It's not hard to come up with a game of this length.  Start with the cards in decreasing order from left to right, and jump until they are in increasing order.  To do this, recursively sort the last $n-1$ cards in $2^{n-1}-n$ jumps, then jump the cards from back to front, arriving at the order $$n-1,n-2,\dots,1,n$$ and then recursively reverse the first $n-1$ cards again. To show that the game cannot go on for ever, I proved the result for a more general game, where the cards are labeled with any $n$ distinct positive integers.  Let $N\ge n$ be the largest label. If $N$ is in the rightmost position, it can never move, and the result follows by induction.  If $N$ is not in the rightmost position, it is enough to show that the game cannot last forever without $N$ moving to the right, that is, without a card jumping from $N'$s right to its left.  This is true by induction  trivially for the cards to $N'$s left, and if the $k$ cards to $N'$ right can jump among themselves forever, then the $K-$card game comprising those cards can also last forever, contradicting the induction hypothesis. The part that gave me the most trouble was establishing that $2^n-(n+1)$ is an upper bound.  I realized early on that is the long path I'd constructed, $k$ jumps $2^{n-k}-1$ times.  Of course, proving this is true in general is enough to establish the upper bound.  It took me quite a while to see how to approach it, but finally I realized that when $k$ jumps, since it moves $k$ positions, it must jump over a number greater than $k$, and that if $K>k,$ then $k$ jumps over $K$ at most $2^{n-K}$ times.  I proved this by induction on $n-k$.  After $k$ first jumps over $K>k,\ K$ is on the right of $k$.  In order for $k$ to jump over $K$ another time, $K$ must first jump over $k$.  Then induction hypothesis implies that $K$ jumps at most $2^{n-K}-1$ times, so $k$ can jump over $K$ at most $2^{n-K}$ times. Do you see a simpler way to do this problem, particularly to establish the upper bound?

How does this chain of previous ""truths"" prove that $P(n) \implies P(n+1)$? For example, a HW problem I have deals with splitting stacks of boxes. The problem goes like this Lets say you have a stack of n boxes. You are allowed to split the stack of boxes into stacks of size l and m, and in doing so, you earn l * m in profit. You must repeatedly split the stacks until you have n stacks of 1 box.  Come up with a conjecture about the max profit you can earn and prove it by strong induction. Basically, the question is asking about breaking a stack of n boxes down repeatedly until you get to n 1 box high stacks, and then compute the sum of profit earned by each successive splitting of the stack. It was fairly easy to come up with a formula that computes the profit earned, which is $n(n-1)/2$. To prove this by strong induction, I first start with a base case. Base Case: $P(1)$ is true because $1(1-1)/2) = 0$ and since you don't split any stacks, you don't earn any money. Inductive Step: Assume $P(1)$ up to $P(n)$ is true and consider $P(n+1)$.

78,Socks on a clothing line,Socks on a clothing line,,"Recently I was putting some socks on the clothing line after taking them from the laundry machine and I while I was doing that I came up with an interesting math problem. I usually wash $30$ or so socks (amounting for $15$ or so pairs) and then I start putting them on clothing lines. On one clothing line I can put at most $8$ socks. Here's my method of ordering: I pick a random sock and I put it on the first line, in the same time ""reserving"" the place after it for it's partner. Next I pick another random sock and if it's partner is already on one of the lines I just put it in the already reserved place, otherwise I put it in the next free place. First I tend to use all the free space on the first line, then on the second and so on. For example if I have something like $x-x-x-x-$ on the first line (where $x$ is a slot filled with a sock and $-$ is an empty slot, reserved for the partner of the sock ahead of it) and I pick up a new sock from the basket then I will put it on the second line and so on. Once while doing this I started wondering: what is the probability of filling the first line with $8$ socks before any other line is filled? What about the second line being filled first, and so on? Unfortunately I haven't been able to get anywhere close to a solution. In order to avoid inconvenience I assume I have $8n$ socks, where $n$ is the number of clothing line. My idea was to number the pairs and shuffle the $8n$ numbers, order them in a line and then look at the probability of the first four distinct numbers finding their partner before any other set of four doing it, as we go along the line of shuffled numbers. Unfortunately things start to get complicated and I can't achieve anything. I even thought of calculating the probability of the first line NOT filling first. I set the position of the last sock from the first line to be $n$ and then I try to find all combinations of putting $4$ other pairs between the first and $n-$th place.

95,Probability that every prefix of a toss sequence has more heads than tails,Probability that every prefix of a toss sequence has more heads than tails,,"We toss a coin $n + m$ times. When we are done, there have been $n$ heads and $m$ tails, with $n > m$. All sequences of results are equally likely. For example, if $n = 2$ and $m = 1$, then $P(HHT) = P(HTH) = P(THH) = \frac{1}{3}$. Now what is the probability that during the course of the experiment, the number of heads we've seen so far is always strictly larger than the number of tails we've seen so far? My first thought was to define $A_i$ to be the event that we've always have more heads than tails up to the end of the $i$th toss, and calculate $P(\bigcap_{i=1}^{n+m}A_i)$, but then I got stuck.","We toss a coin $n + m$ times.
