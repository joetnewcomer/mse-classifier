I asked a question earlier here about why I was getting a different answer when calculating the tangent slope of a line by using the secant method compared to using the Calculus method.

Given r radians, we get degrees by $\ r * \frac{180}{\pi}\ $ Given d degrees, we get radians by $\ d * \frac{\pi}{180}\ $ However, the opposite is true when converting slope per radians and slope per degrees: Given s slope per radians, we get slope per degrees by $\ s * \frac{\pi}{180}\ $ Given t slope per degrees, we get slope per radians by $\ t * \frac{180}{\pi}\ $ It seems illogical that we convert slope per radians to slope per degrees by using the formula which converts degrees to radians.

My goal is to understand this integral's behavior, particularly in terms of its real and imaginary parts, and to find a theoretical solution or express it in terms of well-known functions or integrals. Previous Attempts: Imaginary Part Analysis: Through symmetry arguments and considering the periodic and symmetric properties of the sine and cosine functions, we established that the imaginary part of the integral is zero across the domain of (x). Real Part Behavior: By analyzing the first and second derivatives of the function inside the integral with respect to (x), we proved that the real part of the integral is increasing and monotonic, as well as convex, with respect to (x).

79,Illuminated fraction of Moon's surface ratio question,Illuminated fraction of Moon's surface ratio question,,"On page 345 of Astronomical Algorithms by Meeus, he states that the illuminated fraction $k$ of the Moon's disk is given by the ratio $BC:AC$ (see diagram) where $BC$ is the width of the illuminated crescent and $AC$ is the Moon's diameter. He then goes on to say that this is the same ratio as the crescent's area ( $NCSB$ ) to the total disk area ( $NCSA$ ). The illuminated fraction is given by $$k=\frac{1+\cos i}{2},$$ where $i$ is the phase angle, the angle between the Sun and Earth as seen from the centre of the Moon. Now, I can understand (and derive) why $k$ is the ratio of the lengths $BC:AC$ , but I cannot see why it is also the ratio of the areas. I've looked at the (complicated, to my eyes) formula for the area of a lune (a crescent shape), given in Wikipedia and can't make the link between it and the total disk area.

How do I simplify that and arrive at the nice value of $2.5$ ? The Context I was solving this cubic equation (Cardano's formula and all) $$y^3-\frac{7}{3}y+\frac{20}{27}=0$$ Here $p=-\frac{7}{3}$ and $q=\frac{20}{27}$ . This particular equation has the roots $-\frac{5}{3}$ , $\frac{1}{3}$ and $\frac{4}{3}$ , so I know the result I'm supposed to get but I'm trying to walk through the steps and verify this result myself. I end up with two complex numbers, $$z_1=-\frac{10}{27}+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}i$$ $$z_2=-\frac{10}{27}-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}i$$ whose modulus is $r=|z_1|=|z_2|=\frac{7\sqrt{7}}{27}$ and whose arguments are $\varphi_1=\pi-\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{9\sqrt{3}}{10}\right)$ and $\varphi_2=\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{9\sqrt{3}}{10}\right)-\pi$ . These complex numbers are the result of calculating $$z_{1,2}=-\frac{q}{2}\pm\sqrt{\frac{q^2}{4}+\frac{p^3}{27}}$$ The next step is to obtain the solutions from $$y=\sqrt[3]{z_1}+\sqrt[3]{z_2}$$ knowing that we are taking the complex root of third degree here and so $\sqrt[3]{z_1}$ and $\sqrt[3]{z_2}$ will each give a set of three values (say, $\alpha_i$ and $\beta_i$ , where $i,j=\{0,1,2\}$ ). For the values for which the condition $\alpha_i\beta_j=-\frac{p}{3}$ holds, I will calculate sums $\alpha+\beta$ and those will be the solutions to the original equation. So I need to calculate the complex roots $\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\alpha_3$ and $\beta_1,\beta_2,\beta_3$ and then calculate the three sums $\alpha+\beta$ whose addends satisfy $\alpha\beta=-\frac{p}{3}$ . The Actual Problem I'm not going to list all the calculations, just the first one, since the same problem happens with all the others. Taking the (complex) cube root of $z$ : $$\sqrt[3]{z}=\sqrt[3]{r}\left(\cos\left(\frac{\varphi+2\pi k}{3}\right)+i\sin\left(\frac{\varphi+2\pi k}{3}\right)\right)$$ ( $k=0,1,2$ but I'm only showing the case $k=0$ here.) I found out with the help of Mathcad and Wolfram that one of the pairs of $\alpha$ , $\beta$ to satisfy $\alpha\beta=-\frac{p}{3}$ is actually $\alpha_0$ and $\beta_0$ , the ""first"" cube root values (with $k=0$ ) of the numbers $z_1$ and $z_2$ above. So I get $$\alpha_0=\frac{\sqrt{7}}{3}\left(\cos\frac{\varphi_1}{3}+i\sin\frac{\varphi_1}{3}\right)$$ $$\beta_0=\frac{\sqrt{7}}{3}\left(\cos\frac{\varphi_2}{3}+i\sin\frac{\varphi_2}{3}\right)$$ What do I substitute for $\varphi_1$ and $\varphi_2$ ? Yes, the values I listed above: $\varphi_1=\pi-\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{9\sqrt{3}}{10}\right)$ and $\varphi_2=\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{9\sqrt{3}}{10}\right)-\pi$ . Let me denote $\delta:=\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{9\sqrt{3}}{10}\right)$ . So I get $$\alpha_0+\beta_0=\frac{\sqrt{7}}{3}\left(\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{3}-\frac{\delta}{3}\right)+i\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3}-\frac{\delta}{3}\right)+\cos\left(\frac{\delta}{3}-\frac{\pi}{3}\right)+i\sin\left(\frac{\delta}{3}-\frac{\pi}{3}\right)\right)$$ Since $\cos(-x)=\cos x$ and $\sin(-x)=-\sin x$ , the following are true: $$\cos(-x)+\cos x=2\cos x$$ $$\sin(-x)+\sin x=0$$ So it's possible to simplify the expression $\alpha_0+\beta_0$ : $$\alpha_0+\beta_0=\frac{\sqrt{7}}{3}\cdot2\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{3}-\frac{\delta}{3}\right)$$ And since $\cos(x\pm y)=\cos x\cos y\mp\sin x\sin y$ , $$\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{3}-\frac{\delta}{3}\right)=\cos\frac{\pi}{3}\cos\frac{\delta}{3}+\sin\frac{\pi}{3}\sin\frac{\delta}{3}=\frac{1}{2}\cos\frac{\delta}{3}+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\sin\frac{\delta}{3}$$ and $$\alpha_0+\beta_0=\frac{\sqrt{7}}{3}\cos\frac{\delta}{3}+\frac{\sqrt{7}}{3}\cdot\sqrt{3}\sin\frac{\delta}{3}$$ Finally I substitute back $\delta$ : $$\alpha_0+\beta_0=\frac{\sqrt{7}}{3}\cos\frac{\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{9\sqrt{3}}{10}\right)}{3}+\frac{\sqrt{7}}{3}\cdot\sqrt{3}\sin\frac{\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{9\sqrt{3}}{10}\right)}{3}$$ The Question $\alpha_0+\beta_0$ is indeed one of the three real solutions to the original equation as both Mathcad and Wolfram agree on the value $\alpha_0+\beta_0=\frac{4}{3}$ .

Please help, and thank you.","I tried to simplify it from some ways. (1). (2). since , thus . It follows that (3).Similarly, Am I on the right track? Maybe it is a Jensen's-inequality problem but it seems not always concave up or down in the interval . I am stuck here. Please help, and thank you.","\sin^4(A)+\sin^4(B)+\sin^4(C)+\sin^4(D) =\left(\frac{1-\cos(2A)}{2}\right)^2+\left(\frac{1-\cos(2B)}{2}\right)^2+\left(\frac{1-\cos(2C)}{2}\right)^2+\left(\frac{1-\cos(2D)}{2}\right)^2 =1-\frac{1}{2}\left(\cos(2A)+\cos(2B)+\cos(2C)+\cos(2D)\right)+\frac{1}{4}\cdot\left(2+\frac{\cos(4A)+\cos(4B)+\cos(4C)+\cos(4D)}{2}\right) =\frac{3}{2}-\frac{1}{2}\left(\cos(2A)+\cos(2B)+\cos(2C)+\cos(2D)\right)+\frac{1}{8}\left(\cos(4A)+\cos(4B)+\cos(4C)+\cos(4D)\right) \cos(2A)+\cos(2B)+\cos(2C)+\cos(2D) =2\cos(A+B)\cos(A-B)+2\cos(C+D)\cos(C-D) A+B=\pi-(C+D) \cos(A+B)=-\cos(C+D) =2\cos(A+B)\left(\cos(A-B)-\cos(C-D)\right) =2\cos(A+B)\cdot\left(-2\sin(\frac{A-B+C-D}{2})\sin(\frac{A-B-C+D}{2})\right) =2\cos(A+B)\cdot\left(-2\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-(B+D)\right)\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-(B+C)\right)\right) =2\cos(A+B)\cdot\left(-2\cos(B+D)\cos(B+C)\right) =-4\cos(A+B)\cos(A+C)\cos(A+D) \cos(4A)+\cos(4B)+\cos(4C)+\cos(4D) =2\cos(2A+2B)\cos(2A-2B)+2\cos(2C+2D)\cos(2C-2D) =2\cos(2A+2B)\cos(2A+2C)\cos(2A+2D) [0,\frac{\pi}{2}]","['trigonometry', 'inequality', 'triangle-inequality']"
