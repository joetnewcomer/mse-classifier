0,Converting ODE to Variational Problem (for numerical solution),Converting ODE to Variational Problem (for numerical solution),,"This might be a stupid question, but I cannot find the answer anywhere and as an engineer I don't have the mathematical foundation to investigate this properly myself. So, If I have a simple ODE, say for example a harmonic oscillator like $u''+u=0$ , I know that I can try to convert it into a variational problem by finding a Lagrange function $F$ , so that if I plug it into to the Euler-Lagrange differential equation $$\frac{\partial F}{\partial u}-\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}\frac{\partial F}{\partial u'}+\frac{\mathrm{d^{2}}}{\mathrm{d}x^{2}}\frac{\partial F}{\partial u''}=0$$ I get my ODE back. In this case one easily finds that e.g. $$F=\left(u'\right)^2-u^2$$ fulfills this condition. However now I considered the naive idea of simply just taking the following integral $$\int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}}(u''+u)^{2}\mathrm{d}x\rightarrow\text{min.}$$ So basically to take $F:=(\text{some ODE})^2$ . Naively this seems to me like in its minimum the ODE is satisfied. To test this, I implemented a numerical solver that takes a polynomial ansatz and solves the coefficients to find an approximation of the solution (here a sine) of the ODE between $0$ and $\pi/2$ . And it seems to actually work but the solution isn't exactly the same as for $F=\left(u'\right)^2-u^2$ - it is a little bit less accurate (so clearly not the optimal solution yielded by the ansatz)! However, if I take piece-wise linear functions, this native functional completely fails to provide an approximate solution, while $F=\left(u'\right)^2-u^2$ works perfectly. To investigate a little further I plugged in $F=(u''+u)^{2}$ into the Euler-Lagrange eq. and realize that I get $$2(u''+u)+2\left(u''+u\right)''=0$$ which seems to satisfy the same solution as my original problem. So my two questions that arise from all this: 1) Why is it that the naive idea of doing $F=(\text{some ODE})^2$ seems to be working somewhat but not always, if I want to numerically solve an ODE via variational method? 2) Consequently: If I have an ODE of the form $f(u, u', u'', ..., x)=0$ , all ODEs of the form $f(u, u', u'', ..., x) + \left(f(u, u', u'', ..., x)\right)' + \left(f(u, u', u'', ..., x)\right)'' + ... =0$ seem to have the same solution as the original ODE, but they are in fact of higher order. What is the significance of these ODEs and their solutions? Apologies of the lengthy post but I would really appreciate any input on this. As I said, I am an engineer and quite out of my depth here.

Or is there any other way to show that a proportion of the pathogens that interact with the immune response move into a different compartment that includes surviving pathogen?",,"['ordinary-differential-equations', 'dynamical-systems', 'mathematical-modeling']"

27,Lie Groups Exponential Map,Lie Groups Exponential Map,,"Hallo Math StackExchange users, I have a little question concerning the exponential map and how one can apply this to infinitesimal transformations. I am an engineer in 2nd year and I want to write my bachelor thesis in fluid mechanics. I am using the book Applications of Lie Groups to Differential Equations (Peter J. Olver). As recommended by the author I started to read from Chapter 2.2 and was able to follow. But now I am stuck at something. It's about the heat equation; I could follow the text until the derivation of the generators of symmetry. $$ v_1 = \partial_x, \quad v_2 = \partial_t, \quad v_3 = u\partial_u, \quad v_4 = x\partial_x+2t\partial_t, \quad v_5 = 2t\partial_x-xu\partial_u, \quad \ldots $$ After this passage the one Parameter Groups $G_i$ which are generated by the $v_i$ are calculated by using $(x',t',u')=\exp(\epsilon v_i) (x,t,u)$. It is concluded that $G_1: (x+\epsilon,t,u)$, $G_2: (x,t+\epsilon,u)$, $G_3: (x,t,e^\epsilon u)$, $G_4: (e^\epsilon x, e^{2\epsilon}t,u)$, ... . Can someone explain how I can actually calculate these groups? I tried this interpretation: $\exp(\epsilon v_i)(x,t,u)=(1+\epsilon v_i)(x,t,u) =(x+\epsilon v_i \cdot x,t+\epsilon v_i \cdot t, u \epsilon v_i \cdot u)$. I could recover $G_1$ and $G_2$ using this approach, while interpreting the operation between the exponential and the $(x,t,u)$ as a simple dot product. But from there I have no clue how to show that for $G_3$ and the other $G_i$. I tried this for $v_3 = u\partial_u$. $\exp(\epsilon u\partial_u)(x,t,u)=(1+\epsilon u\partial_u+\frac{(\epsilon u\partial_u)^2}{2!}+...)(x,t,u)=(x,t,u+u\epsilon_u u)=(x,t,u+\epsilon u)$.

I would be very thankful for any answer :D.","Hallo Math StackExchange users, I have a little question concerning the exponential map and how one can apply this to infinitesimal transformations. I am an engineer in 2nd year and I want to write my bachelor thesis in fluid mechanics. I am using the book Applications of Lie Groups to Differential Equations (Peter J. Olver). As recommended by the author I started to read from Chapter 2.2 and was able to follow. But now I am stuck at something. It's about the heat equation; I could follow the text until the derivation of the generators of symmetry. $$ v_1 = \partial_x, \quad v_2 = \partial_t, \quad v_3 = u\partial_u, \quad v_4 = x\partial_x+2t\partial_t, \quad v_5 = 2t\partial_x-xu\partial_u, \quad \ldots $$ After this passage the one Parameter Groups $G_i$ which are generated by the $v_i$ are calculated by using $(x',t',u')=\exp(\epsilon v_i) (x,t,u)$. It is concluded that $G_1: (x+\epsilon,t,u)$, $G_2: (x,t+\epsilon,u)$, $G_3: (x,t,e^\epsilon u)$, $G_4: (e^\epsilon x, e^{2\epsilon}t,u)$, ... . Can someone explain how I can actually calculate these groups? I tried this interpretation: $\exp(\epsilon v_i)(x,t,u)=(1+\epsilon v_i)(x,t,u) =(x+\epsilon v_i \cdot x,t+\epsilon v_i \cdot t, u \epsilon v_i \cdot u)$. I could recover $G_1$ and $G_2$ using this approach, while interpreting the operation between the exponential and the $(x,t,u)$ as a simple dot product. But from there I have no clue how to show that for $G_3$ and the other $G_i$. I tried this for $v_3 = u\partial_u$. $\exp(\epsilon u\partial_u)(x,t,u)=(1+\epsilon u\partial_u+\frac{(\epsilon u\partial_u)^2}{2!}+...)(x,t,u)=(x,t,u+u\epsilon_u u)=(x,t,u+\epsilon u)$. I left out the higher order terms as I thought, that $\partial_u \partial_u u = 0$.

28,From Gravity Equation-of-Motion to General Solution in Polar Coordinates,From Gravity Equation-of-Motion to General Solution in Polar Coordinates,,"I'm having trouble getting the general solution of this differential equation. The gravitational equation of motion is, for constants $M$ and $G$ and position vector $\vec{r}$, $$\frac{d^2}{d t^2}\vec{r} = -\frac{MG}{r^2}\hat{r} $$ By using 2D polar coordinates (one angle $\theta$ and one ""distance from origin"" $r$), one can calculate $\frac{d^2}{dt^2}\vec{r}$ by taking two time derivatives of $\vec{r}=r\hat{r}$. The hat notiation $\hat{r}$ is the unit vector pointing from $\vec{r}$ in the direction of increasing $r$. Similarly, $\hat{\theta}$ is the unit vector pointing from $\vec{r}$ in the direction of increasing $\theta$. By appropriate application of the chain rule of derivatives (remembering to take derivatives of the unit vectors themselves as well), one can derive that (dot means time-dirivative) $$\frac{d^2}{d t^2}\vec{r} = -\frac{MG}{r^2}\hat{r} = \hat{\theta}(2\dot{r}\dot{\theta}+r\ddot{\theta})+\hat{r}(\ddot{r}-r\dot{\theta}^2) $$ Which means $$\begin{equation} -\frac{MG}{r^2}=\ddot{r}-r\dot{\theta}^2 \tag{1} \end{equation} $$ and $$\begin{equation} 0=2\dot{r}\dot{\theta}+r\ddot{\theta} \tag{2} \end{equation} $$ The right hand side of the last equation (2) turns out to be the time derivative of the angular-momentum-per-unit-mass $h$ (to a factor of $r$): $$\frac{d}{d t}h=\frac{d}{d t}(r^2\dot{\theta})=2r\dot{r}\dot{\theta}+r^2\ddot{\theta}=0 $$ Showing that h is constant in time.

From our data, we can estimate two important parameters $\theta \in \mathbb{Z} \backslash 0$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$ . Given $n$ , we can also estimate a function $g(n)$ . Our estimations are fairly accurate. Now it appears that there is a pattern. For example, for $\theta > 0$ , we have \begin{align} &n=1,\quad g(1)= \frac{d f(t)}{dt}+\theta f(t), \\ &n=2,\quad g(2)= \frac{d^2 f(t)}{dt^2}+\theta^2 f(t)+2\theta \frac{d f(t)}{dt}, \end{align} and so on; therefore, I think we can write it as an ordinary differential equation $g(n)=(d_t+θ)^n f(t)$ where $d_t$ is a time-derivative operator. Now is there a way to explicitly determine $f(t)$ ? My Attempt 1) I tried to use Kovacic algorithm but it seems very complicated and I couldn't get anywhere with it. My Attempt 2) Although we have a nonhomogeneous equation due to $g(n)$ , if for every $n$ , we differentiate both sides, we have: \begin{align} & n=1,\quad f'' + \theta f'= 0, \\ & n=2,\quad f'''+2 \theta f''+ \theta^2 f'=0, \end{align} and so on.

I'm more interested in knowing if there is a solution for $f$ and the method to get there rather than the final solution. Edit: I think I have made a mistake: since the root $-\theta$ is a repeated root in the second set of ODEs, I think the solution to $f$ is: $$f_n(t) = C_{0n} + e^{-\theta t}\sum_{k = 1}^{n} C_{kn} t^{k - 1}.$$","Question: We have a function that is defined for all .

Does one of the following hold? $(1)$ $\alpha$ is affine. $(2)$ $\alpha$ is a circular arc. $(3)$ $\alpha$ starts as a circular arc, then at some point becomes affine (i.e. it coincides with the tangent to the circle.) $(4)$ $\alpha$ starts affine, then at some point it swtiches to a circular arc, and after some time, it can also switch one more time to being affine (a tangent). Comments: a. I proved below that the restriction of $\alpha$ to the open set $\{t\, |\,\alpha(t) \not\perp \dot \alpha(t)\}$ is $C^{\infty}$ . Since a $C^2$ curve  having constant momentum must be either affine or a circular arc , and since a circular arc satisfies $\alpha(t)\perp \dot \alpha(t)$ , it follows that $\alpha$ is affine on each connected component of $\{t\, |\,\alpha(t) \not\perp \dot \alpha(t)\}$ . Is there a way to proceed from here? The difficulty seems to be to prove that $\{t\, |\,\alpha(t) \perp \dot \alpha(t)\}$ is a closed interval. Suppose for instance that $\alpha$ starts affine, and that it stays affine up to a certain point $t_0$ satisfying $\alpha(t_0) \perp \dot \alpha(t_0)$ . Suppose that $\alpha$ is not affine after $t_0$ , i.e. there is no $\epsilon>0$ such that $\alpha|_{(t_0-\epsilon,t_0+\epsilon)}$ is affine.  How can we prove that $\alpha(t) \perp \dot \alpha(t)$ still holds for sufficiently small $t>t_0$ ? Assuming this is not the case, there exists a decreasing sequence $t_n \to t_0$ satisfying $\alpha(t_n) \not \perp \dot \alpha(t_n)$ . Thus there exists $\epsilon_n>0$ , such that $\alpha|_{(t_n-\epsilon_n,t_n+\epsilon_n)}$ is affine. However, this fact alone does not imply affinity at $t_0$ . Of course, in our case, all these affine parts around $t_n$ must be tangents to a given circle. Can we use this somehow? b. There is an asymmetry between options $(3)$ and $(4)$ . In option $(4)$ there are two ""switching points"", while in $(3)$ there is only one. Here is  why there cannot be more than one switch in the scenario described in $(3)$ : On a region where $\alpha$ is part of a circle of radius $R$ centered at the origin, it satisfies $|\alpha(t) \times \dot \alpha(t)|=R$ . Switching from a line to a circle is only possible when the line is tangent to that circle. (since we are $C^1$ ). Thus, if we start from a circle, and switch to a tangent, we cannot switch again at some point from the tangent to a tangent circle centered at the origin. (the angle at the contact from the origin is not $\pi/2$ ). Alternatively, after we leave the point of contact of the tangent and circle, the distance from the origin increases, so we cannot switch to a circle centered at the origin, since such a circle would have a different radius, thus violating the constancy of $|\alpha(t) \times \dot \alpha(t)|$ . c. I proved here that if $\alpha$ is assumed to be $C^2$ , then the only options $(1)$ or $(2)$ are possible, i.e. $\alpha$ must be either a circular arc or affine. Clearly, a $C^2$ solution cannot alternate between circular and affine. I don't know how to adapt the proof to this lower regularity setting, since I used there second order derivatives of $\alpha$ . I guess that one possibility would be to use some distributional/weak derivatives instead. I think that a good starting point might be to show $\alpha$ is $C^2$ almost everywhere. Proof that that $\alpha$ is $C^2$ on $\{t\, |\,\alpha(t) \not\perp \dot \alpha(t)\}$ is $C^2$ : Write $\alpha(t)=(X(t),Y(t))$ . The conditions $|\dot \alpha|=1$ and $|\alpha(t) \times \dot \alpha(t)|=c$ , translate into $$ \dot X^2+\dot Y^2=1, \\ X\dot Y-Y\dot X=c. $$ Thus $$ \dot Y=\frac{c+Y\dot X}{X}, $$ which together with $\dot Y^2=1-\dot X^2$ implies that $$ 0=\dot X^2(Y^2+X^2)+(2cY)\dot X+(c^2-X^2). $$ Since the discriminant $$ (2cY)^2-4(Y^2+X^2)(c^2-X^2)=4X^2(|\alpha|^2-c^2), $$ we find that whenever $|\alpha| > c$ , $\dot X$ is a smooth function of $X,Y,c$ . Now, we note that $c=|\alpha(t) \times \dot \alpha(t)| \le |\alpha(t)||\dot \alpha(t)|=|\alpha(t)|$ , with equality if and only if $\alpha(t) \perp \dot \alpha(t)$ . Thus $$ \{t\, |\,|\alpha(t)|>c\}=\{t\, |\,\alpha(t) \not\perp \dot \alpha(t)\}, $$ and since $\dot X$ (and similarly $\dot Y$ ) are smooth functions of $X,Y,c$ , we conclude that $\alpha$ is $C^{\infty}$ on this set.","Let be a curve  satisfying , and assume that is constant.

For a simpler case, where $P$ is defined as above and $Q=1$, by using a change of variable $m=\frac{y}{x}$, we get a quadratic equation for $m$ that could be simply solved and give the two solutions for $m$. I wonder if using same change of variable, one could obtain the solutions for the more general case (with $Q$ of the form given above or similar form). Some background: $x,y$ are coordinates of a point in a two dimensional space and define a line that passes through $(x,y)$ and the origin $(0,0)$. $P$ and $Q$ are derived from projection of some other points on this line. Using $m=y/x$ makes sense since the projections only depend on the slope of the line and not the actual values of $(x,y)$. Our goal is to find the line (defined by its slope $m$) that satisfies $F(x,y)=0$.

The solution given here solves it for mapping from 2D to 1D. I also posted a new question for the case mapping from 3D to 1D here which I expect to be solvable in a similar way.","We have $$ F(x,y)= \frac{Q}{x} \frac{\partial P}{\partial x} - \frac{P}{x} \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}   - \frac{Q}{y} \frac{\partial P}{\partial y}  + \frac{P}{y} \frac{\partial Q}{\partial y}  $$ where $$P = \sum_{i=1}^{N}(a_i x + b_i y)^2 $$ $$Q = \sum_{i=1}^{N}(c_{i} x + d_{i} y)^2$$ and $a_i, b_i, c_{i}, d_{i}$ are constant parameters defined for $1\leq i,j \leq N$. We want to find the solutions of equation $F(x,y)=0$. For a simpler case, where $P$ is defined as above and $Q=1$, by using a change of variable $m=\frac{y}{x}$, we get a quadratic equation for $m$ that could be simply solved and give the two solutions for $m$. I wonder if using same change of variable, one could obtain the solutions for the more general case (with $Q$ of the form given above or similar form). Some background: $x,y$ are coordinates of a point in a two dimensional space and define a line that passes through $(x,y)$ and the origin $(0,0)$. $P$ and $Q$ are derived from projection of some other points on this line. Using $m=y/x$ makes sense since the projections only depend on the slope of the line and not the actual values of $(x,y)$. Our goal is to find the line (defined by its slope $m$) that satisfies $F(x,y)=0$.
