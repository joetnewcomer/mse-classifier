9,Analytical Expression for Hysteresis Loop Area,Analytical Expression for Hysteresis Loop Area,,"EDIT:  I've updated the title and restatement of my question. Is there a known analytical solution for the area of a hysteresis loop?  I've found that a hysteresis loop can be described analytically using parametric equations, however performing contour integration has not bee successful. I’ve been working with a system that exhibits hysteresis and I’ve found that the more common models do not work for me.  I am wondering if anyone is aware of other models that might be out there for hysteresis.  Thus far, I’ve tried the Preisach model and Jiles-Atherton model, neither of which allow me to simulate the types of loops that I work with. I’ve gone the the Physics, Mathematics, Electrical Engineering, Mathematica, and some other StackExchange communities, but haven’t found anything beyond Preisach or Jiles-Atherton being mentioned as potential approaches to modeling/simulating hysteresis.  I found some information on the VINCH model, the Bouc–Wen model, and the Bouc–Wen–Baber–Noori model, but none of them fit what I am trying to model.  This model really needs to be analytical rather than computational.  Some of the models use functions like sign[x] , and so forth, that aren't going to work for my system. I’ve been messing with the idea of using a parametric approach, that is to say, having both quantities that are shown in the hysteresis plot (for instance, M and H for ferromagnetism, or D and E for ferroelectricity, etc.), both being dependent on some other variable. I’ve found one paper that analytically handles this type of model by Lapshin, R.V., Analytical Model for the Approximation of Hysteresis Loop and Its Application to the Scanning Tunneling Microscope. Review of Scientific Instruments , 1995. 66(9): p. 4718-4730 (DOI: 10.1063/1.1145314 ). The model shows some interesting results, however the hysteresis loops that I am trying to model are more complex than those in the publication. Actually, I am considering trying to use a superposition of solutions to try and construct a solution appropriate for my system.  However, my attempts have yet to work. What I am trying to model is the following: a system in hysteresis that allows for both linear and non-linear ""slopes"", as well as linear and non-linear phase lags. Here are the pieces that you see in the graph above: (1)  A linear (reversible), in-phase component, same slope over the entire range (BLUE) (2)  A linear (irreversible), out-of-phase component (RED) (3)  A non-linear (reversible), in-phase component, one slope near origin, saturates far from origin (MAGENTA) (4)  A non-linear (irreversible), out-of-phase component (GREEN) If this was a circuit model, and were plotting charge vs. voltage (q vs V), while driving the circuit sinusoidally, (1) would be simple linear resistor, (2) would be a linear capacitor, (3) would be a non-linear resistor (perhaps one that saturates above a certain voltage, but not a memristor), and (4) would be a non-linear capacitive element that is bistable with very constant remanence and coercivity, not sure what it would be called though, perhaps an ""ideal hysteron"". If you add these four components together, you can get something resembling a proper hysteresis loop: Notice that the hysteresis loop can also be rotated in phase space. Has anyone seen a model that would allow this?  Also, is there some way to correlate these components to real physical properties for a hysteresis loop?

14,Trigonometric functions of angle fractions,Trigonometric functions of angle fractions,,"I've just encountered a problem that seems to me interesting enough so that some result exists on the subject. I was working on a problem in complex analysis, in which I needed the fifth root of a complex number in rectangular coordinates. Long story short, I eventually  reasoned that, being in rectangular form I could easily know $\cos\theta$, $\theta$ being the argument. So I now just needed to find $$\cos{\frac{\theta}5}$$ So I said: Oh, I'll just look up one of those handy trig identities and that's that. Well, the identity for this one wasn't to be found anywhere, or any identities of fractions of angles other than the half angle. So, taking inspiration from the half angle formula's deduction, I expanded $\cos5x$ using sum and double angle identities, which gave: $$\cos5x=16\cos ^5x-20\cos^3x+5\cos x$$ Unsurprisingly I later found that there were tables of such polynomials, and even recursion relations for the general form, and similarly for other trig functions. To my dismay though,  I now had to solve a $5$-th degree polynomial in order to find $\cos x/5$. Every time this happens to me I recall the original exasperation I felt when I learned that no closed form existed for degree $5$ and up. It really pains me. Back to the main question though, is the problem of finding expressions for trigonometric functions of fractions of angles really so non-trivial ? Something tells me yes , because then we could easily calculate cosines and sines of any rational multiple of $\pi$, which doesn't seem so trivial. If someone knows about this, or even just the solution for the specific polynomial I have written, their help will be appreciated.","I've just encountered a problem that seems to me interesting enough so that some result exists on the subject.

20,tangents of infinite sums --- reference request,tangents of infinite sums --- reference request,,"This section of Wikipedia's List of trigonometric identities was, as far as I know, written entirely by me.  For a time, it dealt only with finite sums, and said something like this: $$ \tan(\theta_1+\cdots+\theta_n) = \frac{e_1-e_3+e_5-\cdots}{e_0-e_2+e_4-\cdots}\tag{1} $$ where $e_k$ is the $k$th-degree elementary symmetric polynomial in the variables $\tan\theta_i$, $i=1,\ldots,n$, and the number of terms on the right depends on the number of terms on the left.

In that case, the numerator and denominator would each have infinitely many terms.  But if you're thinking about $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}$ of the expression on the left, then notice that as $n$ grows, each term $e_k$ on the left changes.  Thinking about that seemed moderately icky and I left it alone until this point of view occurred to me: We have two trigonometric identities $$ e_0-e_2+e_4-\cdots =\frac{\sec\theta_1\sec\theta_2\sec\theta_3\cdots}{\sec(\theta_1+\theta_2+\theta_3+\cdots)}\tag{even} $$ $$ e_1-e_3+e_5-\cdots =\frac{\sec\theta_1\sec\theta_2\sec\theta_3\cdots}{\csc(\theta_1+\theta_2+\theta_3+\cdots)}\tag{odd} $$ (The second one has secants in the numerator and cosecants in the denominator, so it's an odd function, like the expression on the left.)

A ship sets sail from England (A) to France (B) covering a distance of 20 miles at an average speed of 5mph.

The ship experiences a sideways current (lateral drift), perpendicular to AB , pushing it off course by 1 mile every hour on average. I’m trying to figure out if the ship’s shortest path will be straight or curved. I’ve played with some sketches and calculations, showing the ship is best setting out for a destination offset from point B to counter the force of the current. While one sketch shows a straight line, I’ve also noticed how the navigation problem relates to the Brachistochrone curve. However, I struggled to understand the underlying calculus.

The initial conditions are: All ellipses will have a common foci $(0,0)$ , but different centers A planet orbiting an ellipse will have a period $T$ The position of a planet in the ellipse will be the reflected point (from the center of the ellipse) given the angle $\theta$ at time $t$ (*) Every ellipse can have a different initial phase angle $\theta_0$ Every ellipse can be rotated about the common foci $(0,0)$ To simplify the problem. We will assume conditions $4.$ and $5.$ are nonexistent. Here's a simple representation of a single ellipse: where $(j,k)$ is the center of the ellipse $(x,y)$ is the result of the ellipse formula at angle $\theta$ $(x',y')$ is the reflected point using the center as a mirror $\omega$ is the angle at point $(x',y')$ *: This is needed to simulate Kepler's second law Problem Given two ellipses (whose variables are denoted by subindex $_1$ and $_2$ in the following formulas), I'd like to find a formula that describes at which times $t$ , $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ are equal. In other words, find the equation of $\omega$ in relation to time $t$ . Here's a gif that shows the specified system of two orbits: where The green dot is the center of the large ellipse The red dot is the center of the smaller ellipse The period of the large ellipse is $T_1 = 6$ s The period of the smaller ellipse is $T_2 = 14$ s The eccentricity of the large ellipse is 0.77 The eccentricity of the smaller ellipse is 0.75 The directrix of both ellipses is 2 So far, I've been able to figure out at which times $t$ both $\theta$ are equal: We know how $\theta$ varies in relation to $t$ , $$\theta = \frac{2\pi t}{T} + \theta_0$$ Since we have stablished that $\theta_0$ doesn't exist, $$\theta = \frac{2\pi t}{T}$$ We know that at time $t$ , both $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ must be equal: $$\theta_2 = \theta_1 + 2\pi k\ \ ,\  k \in \mathbb{Z}$$ where $2\pi k$ represents the periodicity of the orbit. If we substitute: $$\frac{2\pi t}{T_2} = \frac{2\pi t}{T_1} + 2\pi k\ \ ,\  k \in \mathbb{Z}$$ Solve for t: $$t = \frac{k}{\frac{1}{T_2}-\frac{1}{T_1}}$$ This formula gives me at which time $t$ both ellipses will have the same $\theta$ . If we substitute $T_1$ and $T_2$ with the periods of the ellipses in the example gif, we got for $k=1$ , $t=10.5$ s. If you look at the gif, after 10.5s, both red lines will be aligned, meaning $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ will be equal. Another way of finding this formula is using the polar expression of an ellipse: We know that the angle $\theta$ will be $$\theta = \arctan{\frac{y}{x}}$$ And we know that the point $(x,y)$ in polar coordinates is represented as: $$(x,y) = (r\cos{\theta}, r\sin{\theta})$$ Where $r$ is the distance from the center to the point $(x,y)$ , and this distance is given by the polar formula of an ellipse: $$r=\frac{ed}{1+e\cos{\theta}}$$ $$(x,y) = \left(\frac{ed}{1+e\cos{\theta}}\cos{\theta}, \frac{ed}{1+e\cos{\theta}}\sin{\theta}\right)$$ Going back to the formula described at step $1.$ , we have $$\theta = \arctan{\frac{y}{x}} = \arctan{\frac{\frac{ed}{1+e\cos{\theta}}\sin{\theta}}{\frac{ed}{1+e\cos{\theta}}\cos{\theta}}}$$ Simplifying, we have $$\theta = \arctan{\frac{y}{x}} = \arctan{\frac{\sin{\theta}}{\cos{\theta}}} = \arctan{(tan{\theta})}$$ Again, we want both $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ to be equal: $$\arctan{\left(tan{\frac{2\pi t}{T_2}}\right)} = \arctan{\left(tan{\frac{2\pi t}{T_1}}\right)}$$ Which is equivalent to $$\frac{2\pi t}{T_2} = \frac{2\pi t}{T_1} + 2\pi k\ \ ,\  k \in \mathbb{Z}$$ So far so good. Now we want to find at which time $t$ , both $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ are equal. We can use the second approach: We know that the point (x',y') is $$(x',y')=2(j,k)-(x,y) = (2j-x,2k-y)$$ And we already know how to represent $x$ and $y$ in relation to time: $$(x,y) = \left(\frac{ed}{1+e\cos{\theta}}\cos{\theta}, \frac{ed}{1+e\cos{\theta}}\sin{\theta}\right)$$ This means that $(x',y')$ will be $$(x',y') = \left(2j-\frac{ed\cos{\theta}}{1+e\cos{\theta}}, 2k-\frac{ed\sin{\theta}}{1+e\cos{\theta}}\right)$$ Which means that the angle $\omega$ will be $$\omega = \arctan{\left(\frac{2k-\frac{ed\sin{\theta}}{1+e\cos{\theta}}}{2j-\frac{ed\cos{\theta}}{1+e\cos{\theta}}}\right)}$$ Since we want $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ to be equal $$\omega_2 = \omega_1 + 2\pi k$$ $$\arctan{\left(\frac{2k_2-\frac{e_2d_2\sin{\theta_2}}{1+e_2\cos{\theta_2}}}{2j_2-\frac{e_2d_2\cos{\theta_2}}{1+e_2\cos{\theta_2}}}\right)} = \arctan{\left(\frac{2k_1-\frac{e_1d_1\sin{\theta_1}}{1+e_1\cos{\theta_1}}}{2j_1-\frac{e_1d_1\cos{\theta_1}}{1+e_1\cos{\theta_1}}}\right)} + 2\pi k$$ and we know that $k_2=k_1=0$ since condition $5.$ doesn't apply: $$\arctan{\left(\frac{-\frac{e_2d_2\sin{\theta_2}}{1+e_2\cos{\theta_2}}}{2j_2-\frac{e_2d_2\cos{\theta_2}}{1+e_2\cos{\theta_2}}}\right)} = \arctan{\left(\frac{-\frac{e_1d_1\sin{\theta_1}}{1+e_1\cos{\theta_1}}}{2j_1-\frac{e_1d_1\cos{\theta_1}}{1+e_1\cos{\theta_1}}}\right)} + 2\pi k$$ Simplifying... $$\tan{\left(\frac{2\pi t}{T_1}\right)}e_2d_2(4j_1-e_1d_1) = tan{\left(\frac{2\pi t}{T_2}\right)}e_1d_1(4j_2-e_2d_2)$$ At which point, I got stuck. WolframAlpha does not give me a clear answer for $t$ , and if I substitute the example gif variables in this formula, WolframAlpha gives 5 possible $t$ , of which 3 contain an imaginary number $i$ .

Trigonometric identities are not exactly central to the class I am taking, so I believe the question simply wants me to assume this, but I'm still curious as to why it is true.

48,If a function is extended to make it periodic then must the integration limits also be extended?,If a function is extended to make it periodic then must the integration limits also be extended?,,"The following extract is taken from ""Riley, Hobson and Bence - Mathematical methods for physics and engineering"", Section 12.5 - ""Non-periodic functions"", page 422 and 423 : Find the Fourier series of $f(x)=x^2\,$ for $\,\,0\lt x \le 2$ We must first make the function periodic. We do this by extending the range of interest to $−2 \lt x \le 2$ in such a way that $f(x)=f(-x)$ and then letting $f(x+4k) = f(x)$ , where $k$ is any integer. This is shown in ﬁgure 12.5. Now we have an even function of period 4. The Fourier series will faithfully represent $f(x)$ in the range, $−2 \lt x \le 2$ , although not outside it. Firstly we note that since we have made the specified function even in $x$ by extending the range, all the coeﬃcients $b_n$ will be zero. Where $$b_n=\frac{2}{L}\int_{x_0}^{x_0+L}f(x)\sin\left(\frac{2\pi nx}{L}\right)dx\tag{12.5}$$ similarly $$a_n=\frac{2}{L}\int_{x_0}^{x_0+L}f(x)\cos\left(\frac{2\pi nx}{L}\right)dx\tag{12.6}$$ where $x_0$ is arbitrary but is often taken as $0$ or $-\frac{L}{2}$ and $L$ is the period of $f(x)$ . Now we apply $(12.5)$ and $(12.6)$ with $L = 4$ to determine the remaining coefficients: $$a_n=\frac{2}{4}\int_{-2}^{2}x^2\cos\left(\frac{2\pi nx}{4}\right)dx=\frac{4}{4}\int_{0}^{2}x^2\cos\left(\frac{\pi nx}{2}\right)dx$$ The textbook then goes on the evaluate the Fourier series for $x^2$ on $]0,2]$ (which I won't go through here as that is not what this question is about). The following related question I asked on ""Chegg Study"" website is here : Show that the Fourier series of $f(x)=\cos\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)$ for $-\pi\lt x \lt \pi$ is given by $$f(x)=\frac{2}{\pi}+\frac{4}{\pi}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{n+1}\cos(nx)}{4n^2 - 1}$$ So my attempt at the finding the Fourier series for $\cos\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)$ on the interval $-\pi \lt x \lt \pi$ is by using the same method for the previous case $f(x) = x^2$ above. Since $\cos\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)$ is not periodic on $-\pi \lt x \lt \pi$ , $\,$ I will extend the interval to $-2\pi \lt x \lt 2\pi$ A plot of the extended function is shown below: Then by $(12.6)$ , $$\begin{align}a_n &=\frac{2}{L}\int_{x_0}^{x_0+L}f(x)\cos\left(\frac{2\pi nx}{L}\right)dx \\&=\frac{2}{4\pi}\int_{-2\pi}^{2\pi}\cos\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)\cos\left(\frac{2\pi nx}{4\pi}\right)dx\\&=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-2\pi}^{2\pi}\cos\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)\cos\left(\frac{nx}{2}\right)dx\\&=0\end{align}$$ and this has been verified here by Wolfram Alpha.

I then discarded the question:  Surely it had been asked and answered hundreds of years before by someone like Newton, and its answer was likely sitting in a college textbook somewhere. But some years later in college, I realized that I had asked a question that was not about physics but was, in fact, entirely about integer factorization:  If two pendulums of periods $7$ and $5$ start oscillating at time $0$, they will next meet at time $35$, time $70$, and any other time that is a product of $7$, $5$, and some other integer $k$ — and at no other times in between. So I expressed that as a simple relation, as an attempt to find $x$ in this expression: $$\sin 2 \pi x = \sin 2\pi \frac{k}{x} = 0$$ That turned out to be a particularly bad form for any meaningful study, so some months later I reformulated it as this: $$\cos (2\pi x) \cos (2\pi\frac{k}{x}) = 1$$ That this is true only when $x$ is a factor of $k$ is relatively easy to demonstrate: Given an integer $k$, The first cosine is only $1$ when $x$ is an integer; The second cosine is only $1$ when $\frac{k}{x}$ is an integer; The product is only $1$ when both cosines are $1$; And when $x$ is an integer, $\frac{k}{x}$ can only be an integer if $x$ is a factor of $k$; Therefore, the product is only $1$ when $x$ is an integer factor of $k$. In effect, the second cosine constrains the relationship between $k$ and $x$ to be ""factors"", the first cosine constrains $x$ to be integers, and the two together constrain $x$ to be integer factors of $k$. That expression has some nice properties as an alternate definition for ""integer factorization"":  It is well-defined for both positive and negative numbers, well-defined across the entire real number line, including for negative and fractional numbers, and it has an interesting hole at $0$. There are also several variations that can be constructed using sine or cosine, addition or multiplication, and various constants.  For example: $$\cos (2\pi x) + \cos (2\pi\frac{k}{x}) - 2 = 0$$ What I find most interesting about all of these expressions is that they convert the problem of factoring an integer (a discrete mathematics problem) into the domain of finding the real-valued roots of a ""simple"" expression of one variable (a continuous mathematics problem). I have attempted for years since then to see if anybody else has discovered and explored this formulation, but I've never found any references to it in literature or online.
