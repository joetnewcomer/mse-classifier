1,"Ellipticity of Ricci tensor, does it depend on coordinates?","Ellipticity of Ricci tensor, does it depend on coordinates?",,"Well, I am afraid this is a silly question because I know the answer must be 'yes, it does'. But I don't see why. I put the problem in context. The ricci tensor can be regarded as a differential operator acting of metrics (it is an expression that depends on second and first derivatives of the metric). You give the ricci a metric on your manifold $M$ an the ricci gives you a symmetric two tensor. It is non linear. $$ Ric: \{\text{metrics on } M\} \to \{\text{symmetric two-tensors on }M\} $$ So one says that the ricci tensor is elliptic at the metric $g$ if its differential at $g$ denoted by $L:=d_g Ric$ is elliptic. Note that since {metrics on $M$} are an open set of the vector space of symmetric two-tensors, we have $$ L: \{\text{symmetric two tensors}\} \to \{\text{symmetric two tensors}\} $$ and $L$ is a linear differential operator of order two. Recall that $L$ is by definition elliptic if for every $\xi \in T^*_x M$ its principal symbol $$ p(\xi,x): \{\text{symmetric bilinear forms on } x \} \to \{\text{symmetric bilinear forms on } x \} $$  is an isomorphism for $\xi \ne 0$. In coordinates the principal symbol is obtained just by taking the part that involves two derivatives, and in that part changing every $\nabla_i$ you find in for $\xi_i$, the $i-th$ coordinates of $\xi$. It turns out that $p(\xi,x)$ does not depend or coordinates regarded as a endomorphism between vector spaces. Indeed, let $z$ be a symmetric bilinear form on $T_x M$ and let $u$ be a symmetric two tensor on $M$ such that $u(x)=z$. Let $\phi$ be a smooth function on $M$ with $\phi(x)=0$ and $d_x \phi =\xi$. Then $p(x,\xi)z = L(\phi ^2 u)|_x$. This invariant definition is on Besse's Einstein Manifolds. So the principal symbol regarded as a endomorphism between vector spaces does not depend on coordinates, so being elliptic should not depend on coordinates either. But the books, for example Besse's Einstein Manifolds, says that the ricci tensor is elliptic in harmonic coordinates, and it is not elliptic in any coordinates. I must say that is never explicitly said that the ricci operator is not elliptic in any coordinates, but I deduce that because the elliptic regularity results are not true in any coordinates.

Does this formula also holds for local isometries? I managed to reduce the problem to the following result (I think), but I am not sure how to prove it. Let $\gamma:I\to M$ be a curve, $U\subseteq M$ and open set, and $J\subseteq I$ a subinterval such that $\gamma(J)\subseteq U$. Let $\bar{\gamma}=\gamma|_J$.

26,What can we say about a vector bundle with trivial unit sphere bundle?,What can we say about a vector bundle with trivial unit sphere bundle?,,"If you want to avoid the back story to this question, feel free to skip the paragraphs between the horizontal lines. Yesterday Georges Elencwajg asked me the following question (I'm paraphrasing): what can we say about a vector bundle with trivial unit sphere bundle? I told him that if the bundle had rank $k$, then the triviality of the unit sphere bundle gives $k-1$ linearly independent sections of the original bundle. This is not true, or more precisely, the reasoning which lead me to make the statement is false. Allow me to elaborate. Let $\pi : E \to M$ be a rank $k$ real vector bundle on a manifold $M$. If $E$ is trivial, there is an isomorphism of vector bundles $\Psi : E \to M\times\mathbb{R}^k$ and then $r_i(x) = \Psi^{-1}(x, e_i)$ for $i = 1, \dots, k$ is a collection of linearly independent global sections. Now let $SE$ be the unit sphere bundle given by some Riemannian metric on $E$. Then $SE$ is a $S^{k-1}$ fibre bundle over $M$. If $SE$ is trivial, there is an isomorphism of fibre bundles $\Phi : SE \to M\times S^{k-1}$. My thinking was that $e_i \in S^{k-1}$ so, as before, we can define $s_i(x) = \Phi^{-1}(x, e_i)$ and these would be linearly independent global sections - if this actually worked, I'd get $k$ sections rather than the $k - 1$ I had mentioned to Georges. So what's wrong with the approach in the previous paragraph? Well, in the case where $E$ was trivial, the linear independence of $r_i$ relied on the linearity of $\Psi$ when restricted to fibres. In particular, it was important that $\Psi$ was a vector bundle isomorphism rather than a fibre bundle isomorphism (the latter does not require linearity on fibres). In the case of the sphere bundle, we have no such linearity condition (and couldn't possibly as $S^{k-1}$ is not a vector space), so we cannot conclude much about the sections $s_i$, except that they are nowhere zero.

I became interested in this after looking into $C^2(M)$ as a Banach space. The definition of the norm always uses the covariant Hessian $\nabla^2f$ in place for the second derivative. This make sense in that it's easier to define the norm, but it seems strange to me that we need a connection to define the space whereas $C^1(M)$ can be defined with just $f$ and $df$ (which just needs the smooth structure of M). I suppose you need a metric to then define the norm of $df$, which would then give a connection, but still I'm still interested in the question on its own now. Here are the details: Let $f:M \to \mathbb{R}$ be a smooth function on a manifold $M$. We can consider the derivative of $f$, $df:TM \to \mathbb{R}$ by $df(p,v) = df_p(v)$. Now, considering $df$ as a map between the smooth manifolds $TM$ and $\mathbb{R}$ we can take the derivative again to get a function $d^2f: TTM \to \mathbb{R}$ by $d^2f((p,v),w) = d(df)_{(p,v)}(w)$. Note that $d^2f$ is not the exterior derivative of the one form $df$, which would be zero. Now, we can split the double tangent bundle $TTM$ as follows: For $\pi:TM \to M$ we have $d\pi : TTM \to TM$ and we can define $VTM = \ker d\pi$. A choice of complementary subspace $HTM$ such that $TTM = VTM \oplus HTM$ is equivalent(kind of) to a connection on $M$. This is because $VTM \cong TM$ by the regular value theorem, for example. So if $\nu: VTM \oplus HTM \to VTM \cong TM$ is the projection then we can define a connection by $\nabla X = \nu \circ dX$ considering $X$ as a funtion $X : M \to TM$. So, for example, $\nabla_Y X = \nu(dX(Y))$. We get a connection on $M$. Getting to the point, we have $HTM \cong TM$ and the restriction of $d\pi$ to $HTM$ gives an isomorphism $HTM \cong TM$. Consequently $TTM \cong TM \oplus TM$. So we can think of $d^2f$ as $d^2f : TM \oplus TM \to \mathbb{R}$.

Alternatively, take the set of all $(H,\omega)$ pairs, mod adding constants to $H$ and doing $(H,\omega)\to (\alpha H,\omega/\alpha)$ . Each element of this set may be associated to a vector field via the map $v^i=\omega^{ij}\partial_j H$ (call the map $F$ for later reference). The question is: given a vector field $v$ , what does the preimage of $v$ under this map look like (is it empty/one element/large/etc)? This question is inspired by this answer, where Qmechanic gives this local existence theorem: Let there be given a $2n$ -dimensional manifold $M$ with a non-vanishing vector field $X\in\Gamma(TM)$ . Does there locally exists a symplectic two-form $\omega$ , such that $X$ is a Hamiltonian vector field? Answer: Yes! My question differs in that I am interested in uniqueness/non-uniqueness in addition to existence, and I am interested in any obstructions to the existence of a global two-form satisfying the quoted result (aside from the manifold itself not supporting a symplectic structure). For completeness, here are my (haphazard and muddled) attempts at answering this question: The zeroth thing I did was make the following (probably very flawed) degree of freedom counting argument, forgetting about topological obstructions etc. It takes $2n$ functions on $M$ to specify $v$ , $2n-1$ functions on $M$ to specify $\omega$ (since we can add gradients to the tautological one form without changing $\omega$ ), and $1$ function for the hamiltonian. Thus the very naive reasoning suggests that vectors $v$ should be in correspondence with pairs $(H,\omega)$ . As we see below this fails to happen (even for well-behaved examples), so I would be interested in how to make this sort of argument properly. The next thing I tried was to work out some specific cases. The hamiltonian flow for the harmonic oscillator, which on $\mathbb{R}^2$ with coordinates $(q,p)$ looks something like $(p,-q)$ , seems to be hamiltonian with respect to any symplectic form which is a function of $p^2+q^2$ (which seems like a lot of freedom). In particular, let $d\equiv (p^2+q^2)/2$ and consider the hamiltonian $H=f(d)$ and the symplectic form $\omega=f'(d) dq\wedge dp$ . Given any function $f'(d)$ which is nonzero everywhere, $\omega $ so defined will be a globally defined two-form, and $H$ will be a globally defined hamiltonian, such that the image of $(H,\omega)$ under $F$ is $v$ . Now let us consider a slightly different situation. Let's work on $\mathbb{R}^2\setminus \{0\}$ , and define $v$ to be the flow $(-q,-p)$ (i.e. a radially inward flowing vector field). This is obviously not hamiltonian under the usual form on $\mathbb{R}^2$ , but if I did the Mathematica right, any symplectic form of the form $$\omega = \frac{f'(p/q)}{q^2} dq\wedge dp,$$ with a hamiltonian of the form $H=f(p/q)$ , will reproduce this vector field. In this case, unlike before, not any positive $f'$ will give us a globally defined symplectic form, since for instance $f(x)=x$ would produce singularities at $q=0$ . Thus, even though locally we have the same freedom to pick $\omega$ , globally we do not. However, the choice: $$f(x)=\frac{x^2}{1+x^2}$$ (which I basically found by guess-and-check) seems to produce a globally defined symplectic form and hamiltonian, so there still exists a global symplectic form on our space with respect to which this vector field is hamiltonian. Evidently according to this comment , we can also find vector fields on $\mathbb{R}^2\setminus \{0\}$ that don't admit any $(H,\omega)$ pairs globally, although presumably there is still a lot of freedom in picking those pairs locally. Is there any obvious geometric feature/property that we can use to distinguish these three cases just from looking at $v$ ? Lastly, I wanted to briefly note the following. On some manifolds we can choose vector fields that are locally hamiltonian but not hamiltonian (like the last example before; see, for instance, Exercise 7 here ). In this situation, we can find a globally defined symplectic form $\omega$ , and a collection of locally defined hamiltonians, such that on each patch $v$ arises via hamilton's equations. However, one could imagine a situation where no one global symplectic form will do, no matter how ""multivalued"" we allow $H$ to be. Is there one?

If $M$ has a smooth structure, show that it has uncountably many distinct ones.

89,Some possible mistakes in Bott and Tu [closed],Some possible mistakes in Bott and Tu [closed],,"Closed . This question needs to be more focused . It is not currently accepting answers. Want to improve this question? Update the question so it focuses on one problem only by editing this post . Closed 5 years ago . Improve this question I've been reading Bott and Tu's book ""Differential Forms in Algebraic Topology"" and it seems that this book has an enormous list of errors. Therefore I would like to confirm if the parts that I will cite are, in fact, wrong and, if I'm correct, I would like to know how to solve these problem. Here is a link to the edition of the book that I'm using http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~aar/papers/botttu.pdf . 1) In page 43 (proof of theorem 5.1), they claim that finite intersections of geodesically convex open sets are geodesically convex. However choosing two open sets covering the circle, would give a counterexample to this. Maybe the correct notion of good cover (in page 42), should be a covering such that finite intersections are diffeomorphic to finite disjoint copies of $\mathbb{R}^n$ . (As noted by Kevin Carlson and Mariano Suárez-Alvarez the geodesics must be minimizing, therefore I was wrong) 2) In page 65, they define a sequence of vector bundles to be exact if they're fiberwise exact. This is not the correct definition, since the kernel of a morphism that collapse some fiber will be $0$ . 3) In page 69, there is a diagramm and they claim it's commutative, but there's no reason at all. And just above the diagram they say: ""If $f: M \rightarrow M'$ is an orientation preserving map of oriented manifolds, $T$ is a tubular neighborhood of the closed oriented sub manifold $S$ in $M$ , and $f(M')$ is transversal to $S$ and $T$ , then $f^{-1}T$ is a tubular neighborhood of $f^{-1}S$ in $M$ ."". However $T$ has always codimension $0$ , so how can $f(M')$ not be transversal to $T$ , clearly, there's something wrong going on here. Furthermore there is no reason (beyond the intuition) to $f^{-1}T$ be a tubular neighborhood of $f^{-1}S$ . So this part, clearly, needs some clarifications. 4) In page 70, execise 6.32 may not be right for any deformation retract, since the composition $(ir)^* \in \text{End}(\Omega(\mathbb{R}^n\setminus  \{0 \}))$ (for some retraction $r$ and an inclusion $i$ ) is not the identity. Therefore $dr\wedge r^{*}(d\theta|_{S^2})$ may not be positive, for instance. 5) In page 79  (just before the beginning of the section 7), they claim that $s\pi: E_0 \rightarrow E$ is clearly homotopic to the inclusion $i: E_0 \rightarrow E$ , where $E_0$ is the complement of the zero section, $s$ is the zero section and $\pi: E \rightarrow M$ is the vector bundle. This looks like very weird. For instance, consider $M = *$ (a point), then they are claiming that the map $\mathbb{R}^n \setminus \{0\} \rightarrow \{0 \}$ is homotopic to the inclusion $i: \mathbb{R}^n \setminus \{0 \} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ , so the sphere would be homotopic to a point! (As noted by Kevin Carlson, in fact, this is equivalent to the contractibility of $\mathbb{R}^n$ , therefore I was wrong. I don't know why, but I was thinking about isotopies fixing the circle) 6) In page 102 and 103, they claim that the collating formula (page 102) is a morphism $f: C(\mathcal{U}, \Omega) \rightarrow \Omega(M)$ that induces an isomorphism in level of cohomology by using a a homotopy operator (in the beginning go the page 103). However the collating formula is not well defined since in the second sum $\sum_{i=0}^{n+1}K(-D''K)^{i-1} \beta_i$ the term $K(-D''K)^{-1}$ is not well defined. I tried to exclude this term, but then everything goes wrong (for instance, the first computations in page 104 does not hold). 7) In page 104 (proposition 9.8), they claim to have created an explicit isomorphism between \v{C}ech cohomology and de Rham cohomology $f(\eta) = (-D''K)^n \eta$ by using the collating formula. However as stated above (in 6), the collating formula is ill defined, so this explicit isomorphism may not be true. However, in page 120-122, they use this isomorphism to prove that the Euler class and the global angular form coincides with their previous definition. So, again, this may not be right, since the collating formula was ill defined. 8)In page 108 (example 9.14), they claim that for $M = \mathbb{Z}^{+}$ and $F = \mathbb{Z}^{+}$ the Kunneth formula does not hold by claiming that $H^{0}(M) \otimes H^{0}(F)$ consist of finite sums of integer matrices of rank one. However $H^{0}$ is contravariant, so $H^{0}(F) = H^{0} (M) = H^{0} (\mathbb{Z}^+) = H^{0} (\coprod^{0 <i < \aleph_0} *) = \prod_{0<i< \aleph_0} \mathbb{R}$ , hence $H^{0} (M) \oplus H^{0} (F)$ is not isomorphic to $\bigoplus_{0<i< \aleph_0}\mathbb{R}$ as they claim. 9)In page 109, the definition of a constant presheaf is wrong. They define a presheaf $\mathscr{F}$ to be constant with abelian group $G$ if for every connected open set $U$ and any open set $V \subset U$ the restriction $\mathscr{F}(U) \rightarrow \mathscr{F}(V)$ is the identity. This is clearly wrong, since when $V$ is disconnected $\mathscr{F} (V) = G^{\pi_0 (V)}$ when $\mathscr{F}$ is a constant sheaf. The correct definition should be that $\mathscr{F}(U) \rightarrow \mathscr{F}_x$ is the identity for every connected set $U$ and $x \in U$ . (As noted by Kevin Carlson, they intended to define just a pre sheaf. I thought that they wanted to define a constant sheaf without talking about equalizers. Anyway, the requirement for $U$ to be connected still weird, since there would be no locally constant presheaves on a totally disconnected space, but this is just an unfortunate choice made by the authors) (I've double checked the book and they really use the constant SHEAF instead of the constant presheaf as they've defined. There are a lot of occurrences where this is problematic. For instance, in page 189 (Remark), they claim that the zeroth \v{C}ech cohomology has dimension equal to the number of connected components. Furthermore, in page 97, they define the constant ""presheaf"" $\mathbb{R}$ as the sheaf of locally constant functions. So, clearly, there's a problem here) 10)In page 133 (remark 12.4.2), they claim that a section of an oriented vector bundle $s^{*}: H_{cv}(E) \rightarrow M$ ( $s: M \rightarrow E$ ) must factorize through the inclusion $i: H_{cv} (E) \rightarrow H(E)$ . However this is not always true, since $i$ may not be injective. 11)In page 135 (proof of proposition 12.8), they claim that $\int_{S_x}\Phi = \int_{E_x} \Phi$ because $E_x$ is homotopic to $S_x$ modulo the region in $E$ where $\Phi$ is zero. However this makes no sense, since the integral is not invariant under homotopy of the domain. Although homotopic maps have the same integral. 12)In page 140 (exercise 12.12.1), the index of the sum should start at $0$ and not at $1$ . 13)In page 147 (the extension principle), they claim that a map $\partial I^k \rightarrow X$ may be extended to $I^k \rightarrow X$ if $\pi_q (X) \cong 0$ for $q \leq k-1$ . However they provide no references for this result and, since this book has so many errors, I'm starting to doubt if this is true. 14)In page 177 (""The Gysin Sequence""), they claim that in an oriented sphere bundle every locally constant pre sheaf has no monodromy and, therefore, is constant. However I could not see why this is true (by using the already introduced machinery). I think they're confusing it with the fact that a locally constant presheaf in an oriented vector bundle is constant (by using the argument in page 131-132 that restrict the Thom class). Maybe it's possible conclude this for sphere bundles coming from vector bundles (by using the fact for vector bundles), however not every sphere bundle may have its structure group (as a $G$ -bundle) reduced to $O(k)$ . 15)In page 178 (in the bottom of the page), they claim that an element of $H^{n-k}(M) \otimes H^k(S^k)$ may be represented by $\pi^{*}\omega \wedge (-\psi)$ where $\omega \in H^{n-k} (M)$ and $\psi$ the global angular form. However this is not, in general, true since Leray-Hirch theorem does not hold in this case and $\psi$ is not closed (though it's locally closed). 16)In page 183, the face operator is not defined correctly. The correct definition should be $\partial_q^i (\sum_{j = 0}^{q-1} t_j P_j) = \sum_{j = 0}^{i-1}t_jP_j + \sum_{j = i+1}^{q}t_{j-1}P_j$ . 17)In page 189 (in the bottom of the page), the exact sequence for singular cohomology is wrong. Instead of direct sums, it should be products since the functor $\text{Hom}(-, \mathbb{Z})$ is left exact (in the opposite category), hence it sends colimits to limits. Sorry for the long list. If someone know about any other possible mistakes in the book, please, let me know. Thanks in advance. EDIT I've checked the new edition of the book and some mistakes were corrected. More specifically, 6, 7, 9, 12, 16 and 17 were corrected. I should mention too that, as commented above, 1, 5 and 13 are not mistakes.","Closed . This question needs to be more focused .
