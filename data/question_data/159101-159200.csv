10,Proof of minor claim related to the Twin Primes Conjecture,Proof of minor claim related to the Twin Primes Conjecture,,"Question: How can it be proven that integers of the form $n=6jk\pm j \pm k;\ j,k\in \mathbb N^*,$ are the only ones which (when multiplied by $6$) correspond to multiples of $6$ not between twin primes? How do we know that no other integers exist such that when they are multiplied by $6$ their products are also not between twin primes? Context: A few years ago, I asked this question hoping that someone might have some advice about tackling Diophantine equations of this sort. No such luck. Specifically, the question has to do with finding integer solutions $n, j, k \in \mathbb N^*$ to the following equation  $$ n=6jk\pm j\pm k $$ Since every pair of twin primes must have a multiple of $6$ between them, it is a simple matter to show that integers, $n$, of this form correspond to multiples of $6$ that don't flag a twin prime pair - i.e. $6n+1$ or $6n-1$ is not prime. The reasoning is simply that whenever a multiple of $6$ is divisible by an integer one less or one greater than some other multiple of $6$, then there is a nearby multiple of $6$ which is adjacent to a multiple of that same number one less or one greater. For instance, $30$ is divisible by $5$, so neither $24$ nor $36$ can fall between twin primes since they are adjacent to $25$ and $35$ respectively. Likewise, $210$ is a multiple of $6$ which is not between twin primes since $209=11\times 19$, and this can be determined with the formula since $210=6\times 35$, $35=33+2$, and $33$ is a multiple of $11=6\times 2 -1$. In other words, this equation acts as a sieve selecting out multiples of $6$ which definitely do not neighbor twin primes. Therefore, this line of reasoning imposes a necessary condition on any potential twin prime candidates. Is this condition not only necessary but sufficient? OEIS contributor Jon Perry seems to think that it is sufficient since he claims here that ""6n-1 and 6n+1 are twin primes iff n is not of the form 6ab +- a +- b."" The proof of the conditional is fairly straightforward (as I have already explained), but the converse is far less obvious to me.

38,Convergence of Riemann Zeta Function for Normed Arguments,Convergence of Riemann Zeta Function for Normed Arguments,,"My question is concerned with the convergence of the sum $$\displaystyle \sum_{\substack{\ \ m \in \mathbb{Z}^d} \\ {\ \  \ m \neq 0}} \frac{1}{\|m\|_{d}^s},$$ where $d \in \mathbb{N}$, and $\|m\|_d := \sqrt{|m_1|^2 + ... + |m_d|^2}$ denotes the usual Euclidean norm on $\mathbb{R}^d$. Is it true that this sum converges whenever $\mathrm{Re}(s) > d$? Obviously, when $d = 1$, we get the usual definition of the Riemann zeta function, which we know converges for $\mathrm{Re}(s) > 1$ and admits an analytic continuation to the rest of the complex plane. The convergence of similar sums has been investigated -- for instance, see this question on the convergence of the Riemann zeta function in higher dimensions, and there are similar results out there for modified zeta functions such as the so-called Barnes zeta function . These two results intuitively seem to suggest that one might expect the sum to converge for $\mathrm{Re}(s) > d$. Mathematica does not seem to be able to deal with the sum for $d \geqslant 2$. Can anyone confirm if this is true (or if it is false, provide conditions under which this sum does converge)? Moreover, does anyone know of any reference where this question has been discussed?","My question is concerned with the convergence of the sum $$\displaystyle \sum_{\substack{\ \ m \in \mathbb{Z}^d} \\ {\ \  \ m \neq 0}} \frac{1}{\|m\|_{d}^s},$$ where $d \in \mathbb{N}$, and $\|m\|_d := \sqrt{|m_1|^2 + ... + |m_d|^2}$ denotes the usual Euclidean norm on $\mathbb{R}^d$. Is it true that this sum converges whenever $\mathrm{Re}(s) > d$? Obviously, when $d = 1$, we get the usual definition of the Riemann zeta function, which we know converges for $\mathrm{Re}(s) > 1$ and admits an analytic continuation to the rest of the complex plane. The convergence of similar sums has been investigated -- for instance, see this question on the convergence of the Riemann zeta function in higher dimensions, and there are similar results out there for modified zeta functions such as the so-called Barnes zeta function .

You can't tell a computer: ""build a circle and divide its diameter by its circumference"". You need to define what a circle is. Wikipedia defines a circle as: It is the set of all points in a plane that are at a given distance from a given point, the centre.

There are even many kind of trees and I can actually write down all of them how they truly are. Using the λ-calculus, for example, I can represent a complete, untagged binary tree of depth 2 using the lambda-church encoding: tree : (∀ (t : *) -> (t -> t -> t) -> t -> t) tree = (λ branch tip . branch (branch tip tip) (branch tip tip)) That is a tree, on its true form.

From Nesterenko 's results [1996] we know the independence of $\pi$, some values of the Gamma $\Gamma$ function and some powers of $e^\pi$. From the unproved Schanuel's conjecture follows that $\pi$ and $e$ are independent. Are there examples of more notable (conjectured or known) algebraically independent transcendental numbers?
