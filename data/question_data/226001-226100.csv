5,Relation of regular map with the map of tangent Cones,Relation of regular map with the map of tangent Cones,,"I am reading Chapter 1 of J.S. Milne notes. Link is here: https://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/LEC.pdf I am confused on Example 2.7(a) on page 18 of the notes.  So the situation is we have a regular map $$\phi: \mathbb{A}^{1}\rightarrow V $$ $$t \rightarrow (t^{2}-1,t(t^{2}-1))$$ where $V$ is the variety defined by $Y^{2}-X^{3}-X^{2}=0$ . I guess I am confused on two things.  The first one feels obvious as I feel I am just missing some trivial thing.  However, for the second question, I feel I am missing something important. Why exactly is the tangent cone to $\mathbb{A}^{1}$ at the point $Q=1$ defined to be $k[s]$ where $s$ is the class of $T-1$ in $m_{Q}/m_{Q}^{2}$ ? Also, I am having trouble seeing how a regular map $\phi$ induces a map of tangent cones.  So my question how does $\phi$ determine that $x$ maps to $2s$ and $y$ maps to $2s$ ? Here are my thoughts so far. For question 1, from definition, if our variety is $V=Spec(k[X_{1},...,X_{n}])/\frak{a}$ , then we take the initial part of the polynomials defined in the ideal $\frak{a}$ .  However, for question 1, isn't affine space $\mathbb{A}^{1}$ defined by the zero polynomial.  Of course, the definition is defined for the origin so as $Q=1$ , it would be $Spec(k[T-1]/(0))$ . But $\frak{a}=0$ still so I feel so I am not sure what the tangent cone is. In other words, initial part of $0$ is $0$ right? For question 2, I am just not sure how to go from a regular map to maps of the tangent cone.  I looked on Tangent Spaces and Morphisms of Affine Varieties which gives me an idea of how regular map induces a map of tangent spaces through the Jacobian.  However, I am not sure how a regular map induces a map of tangent cones.  I tried playing around with variables to see how to even get $2s=2(T-1)$ . So as $m_{Q}=T-1$ the quotient $m_{Q}/m_{Q}^{2}$ is $(T-1)/(T^{2}-2T+1)$ . From the regular map, $x$ maps to $T^{2}-1$ which is $2T-1-1$ which is $2(T-1)=2s$ . I am assuming that is how we figure out where $x$ maps to.  Now, as $y$ maps to $t(t^{2}-1)$ , we do not get the same result. My guess is since on the tangent cone on $V$ , $y=x$ or $y=-x$ , we get $y$ maps to $2s$ or $-2s$ . I feel I am missing something important for question 2.","I am reading Chapter 1 of J.S.

If a field L is ring-finite over a subfield K, then L is module-finite (and hence algebraic) over $K$ . Proof. Suppose $L = K[v_1,...,v_n]$ . The case n = 1 is taken care of by the above discussion, so we assume the result for all extensions generated by n − 1 elements. Let $K_1 = K(v_1)$ .

Let $F(x,z) \in \mathbb{C}[x,z]$ be a homogeneous polynomial of degree $2n+1 \geq 3$ , and consider the curve $C$ cut out by $y^2 = F(x,z)$ in the weighted projective space $\mathbb{P}_{2,2n+1,2}$ with coordinates $[x : y : z]$ . Then there is a $2$ -to- $1$ map $\phi \colon C \to \mathbb{P}^1$ given by sending $[x : y : z] \mapsto [x : z]$ . It appears that $\phi$ realizes $C$ as a double cover of $\mathbb{P}^1$ branched over $2n+1$ points, namely the roots of $F(x,z) = 0$ , so I'd guess that the curve $C$ has to be singular.

45,"Not Following Serre's Argument: Extension/Restriction of a Sheaf, Continuity","Not Following Serre's Argument: Extension/Restriction of a Sheaf, Continuity",,"I am working through the proof of proposition 5 in Section 5: Extension and restriction of a sheaf in FAC by Serre. FAC can be found in english here , and in particular this question arises on page 11, but I will also include the entire proposition and proof below, and I will also warn that Serre uses the etale space definition of a sheaf (much older), not the modern functor definition. The categories are equivalent. If you have only seen the modern definition this will seem strange. If anyone needs me to include certain definitions if they are unfamiliar with notation Serre uses, just let me know. I feel this should be and easy proof to follow, but I am having trouble in some spots. Definition: Let $X$ be a topological space, $Y$ its closed subspace and $\mathscr{F}$ a sheaf on $X$ . We say $\mathscr{F}$ is concentrated on $Y$ if we have $\mathscr{F}_x = 0$ for all $x \in X-Y$ . Question 1 [answered!]: Why does he say ""Y its closed subspace"" as though it is unique? Was this just a weird bit with translating from french? I am just interpreting it as $Y is a closed subspace"". Proposition 5. If a sheaf $\mathscr{F}$ is concentrated on $Y$ , the homomorphism $\rho_{Y}^{X}: \Gamma(X,\mathscr{F}) \to \Gamma(Y,\mathscr{F}(Y))$ is bijective (thus an isomorphism). Remarks: $\mathscr{F}(Y)$ is the sheaf induced on $Y$ by $\mathscr{F}$ . $\mathscr{F}_x$ is the stalk of $\mathscr{F}$ over the point $x$ . $\Gamma(U,\mathscr{F})$ is the group of sections over $U$ with respect to the sheaf $\mathscr{F}$ . Proof: [copied verbatim] If a section of $\mathscr{F}$ over $X$ is zero over $Y$ , it is zero everywhere else since $\mathscr{F}_{x} = 0$ if $x \notin Y$ , which shows that $\rho_{Y}^{X}$ is injective. Conversely, let $s$ be a section of $\mathscr{F}(Y)$ over $Y$ , and extend $s$ onto $X$ by putting $s(x) = 0$ for $x \notin Y$ ; the mapping $x \mapsto s(x)$ is clearly continuous on $X - Y$ . On the other hand, if $x \in Y$ there exists a section $s'$ of $\mathscr{F}$ over an open neighborhood $U$ of $x$ for which $s'(x) = s(x)$ . Since $s$ is continuous on $Y$ by assumption, there exists an open neighborhood $V$ of $x$ , contained in $U$ and such that $s'(y) = s(y)$ for all $y \in V \cap Y$ . But since $\mathscr{F}_y = 0$ for $y \notin Y$ , we also have that $s'(y) = s(y)$ for $y \in V-(V \cap Y)$ ; hence $s$ and $s'$ coincide on $V$ , which proves that $s$ is continuous in a neighborhood of $Y$ , so it is continuous everywhere. My interpretation / what I do understand: The injectivity part is fine, and on a big picture I understand what we're trying to do in surjectivity - we nominate the only possible candidate for a preimage (the extension of a section over $Y$ by 0). This candidate will easily satisfy the composition requirement with the local homeomorphism to be a section, so we need continuity. This is the interesting part of the result, because extensions of this sort are not always continuous for general topological settings, so this is a sheaf property. So we have this closed subspace $Y$ and some continuous map $s: Y \to \mathscr{F}(Y)$ and we form this new piece wise map (which I call) $s^{*}: X \to \mathscr{F}$ given by $$ s^{*}: x \mapsto \cases{ s(x), &x $\in$ Y\\ 0, &x $\notin$ Y }$$ I understand how Serre says that $s^{*}$ is continuous on $X-Y$ , which is because the trivial global section is always continuous, and this is just a restriction of that. I also understand why it is justified when he says that the section $s'$ exists for some open subset $U$ with the property $s(x) = s'(x)$ for the $x \in Y$ . It is after this that things are semi-familiar, but not entirely clear to me. Uncertainties: 1) First of all why does he start his surjectivity proof by saying   ""conversely""? I have never thought of surjectivity as the converse of   injectivity? 2) Picking up from where I left off with what I do understand, in   Serres next line he asserts the existence of the open set $V$ contained in $U$ with the property that $s$ and $s'$ agree on $V \cap Y$ . It seems like he is invoking the fact that any two   sections with the property that $s(x) = s'(x)$ must agree on some open   neighborhood, but the $V$ he invokes seems different than this? Once   the existence of this $V$ is justified I understand why it follows   that $s$ and $s'$ agree on $V$ , but then I am again confused how to   explain why it follows $s$ is continuous everywhere. It makes   intuitive sense, because our problem spots are really just the   boundary of $Y$ ? But for every single point of $Y$ , we have an open   set $V_y$ so that $s$ is continuous on $V_y$ , then $s$ is also   continuous on $Y^c$ so we can paste together all the $V_y$ 's and $Y^c$ to get one big continuous function? 3) Does the above result actually rely on $Y$ being closed? Does it   not hold for $Y$ open? Aside from the result, are there reasons that   we define the concentrated sheaf definition only for closed $Y$ ? I   know things can get weird with the direct limits when single points   are closed, are we avoiding stuff like that? Follow up: After some time thinking about this, the only part that is really an issue now is how Serre gets the set $V$ with the property that it is contained in $U$ and $s$ , $s'$ agree on $V \cap Y$ . Edit: I think I am close? We know that for any point $a \in \mathscr{F}$ there is an open neighborhood $W$ of $a$ such that $\pi|_{W} W \to \pi(W)$ is a homeomorphism with $\pi(W)$ open in $X$ . Take $ V = (s')^{-1}(W)$ , then $V \subseteq U$ and $V \subseteq \pi(W)$ . Since $(\pi|_{W})^{-1}$ is a bijection then for each $w \in \pi(W)$ there is exactly one element, say $(f,w)$ of $\mathscr{F}_W$ in $W$ . So if $v \in V = (s')^{-1}(W)$ then $s'(v) \in W$ and say $s'(v)=(g,v)$ but $(\pi|_{W})^{-1}(v) = (g,v)$ so $(\pi|_{W})^{-1}$ and $s'$ agree on $V$ .

I had trouble showing that it wasn't an algebraic set. So, instead of forcing that route, I build a set that I imagine won't be algebraic out of points instead of arcs. The construction is as follows: Pick any two distinct points at least distance one from eachother in the plane. Pick another point by avoiding all lines connecting the previous points, and choose this point to be at least distance one from the other points. We can build a countable collection of isolated points in this way, call it $X$. If $X$ doesn't intersect a line $L$, great. If it does in exactly one point, great.

89,Wanting to check that finite-type morphisms of integral schemes restrict to finite morphisms,Wanting to check that finite-type morphisms of integral schemes restrict to finite morphisms,,"So I am only just starting to become familiar with schemes, and having had some previous work checked, I seem to have a habit of overlooking subtitles which I would really like to have cleared up early. I realize it's a big post, but I would really appreciate if anyone could have a look through and see if what I have done seems valid (or if there are any suggestions of more elegant solutions). So the question is from Hartshorne, II (exercise 3.7). I am given a dominant, finite-type, generically finite morphism $f: X \longrightarrow Y$  of integral schemes. I am required to show that there is an open dense subset $U \subseteq Y$ such that the induced morphism $f^{-1}(U) \longrightarrow U$ is finite. The following is my attempt at a solution. Let $f: X \longrightarrow Y$ be a finite-type morphism of integral schemes. Let $\eta \in Y$ be the generic point of $Y$ and let $\varepsilon \in X$ be the generic point of $X$ (each scheme has a unique generic point since they are irreducible). Since each scheme is the topological closure of their generic point, it must be the case that any open set must contain the generic point, and hence must be dense. Now choose any affine open set $\text{Spec } B$ of $Y$, and since $f: X \longrightarrow Y$ is finite type, we have that  $$ f^{-1} (\text{Spec }B) = \bigcup_{i = 1}^{N} \text{Spec } A_{i} $$ where each $A_{i}$ is a finitely generated $B$-algebra, via morphisms $$ \phi_{i}: B \longrightarrow A_{i}. $$ Since $X$ is irreducible, any of the $\text{Spec } A_{i}$ are dense and must contain the generic point $\varepsilon$. Now choose a particular one of the $\text{Spec }A_{i}$ which contains $f(\eta)$, call it $\text{Spec } A$. Now we have that the morphism $$ g:=f|_{\text{Spec }}: \text{Spec } A \longrightarrow \text{Spec }B $$ is itself dominant, since its image includes the generic point of $\text{Spec } B$. Now we claim that the corresponding morphism of algebras $$ \phi: B \longrightarrow A $$ is injective. Suppose we have $h \in B$ with $\phi(h)= 0$. Then we have $$ g^{-1}(D(h)) = D(\phi(h)) = D(0) = \emptyset. $$ But since $g$ is dominant, this must mean that $D(h)$ is empty, which can only happen if $h$ is nilponent. But since $B$ is an integral domain, we have that $h = 0$. By definition of $A$ being a finitely generated $B$-algebra, we have an exact sequence $$ B[x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots x_{m}] \longrightarrow A \longrightarrow 0 $$ Now let $S$ be the multiplicative set of $B$ of all non-zero elements. By right exactness of the tensor product (treating $A$ as a $B$-module), we have $$ S^{-1}B [x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots , x_{m}] \longrightarrow A \otimes_{B} S^{-1}B \longrightarrow 0 $$ The ring $S^{-1}B$ is the field of fractions of $B$ by definition. I claim also that $A \otimes_{B} S^{-1}B$ is the field of fractions of $A$. Indeed any map $A \longrightarrow R$ to some ring $R$ which sends all non-zero elements of $A$ to invertible elements in $R$ can be precomposed with $\phi$, and by the injectivity of $\phi$, this becomes a map $B \longrightarrow R$ that sends every non-zero element of $B$ to an invertible element. Then by the universal property of the localization of $B$, as well as the universal property for the tensor product, we can show that $A \otimes_{B} S^{-1}B$ satisfies the appropriate universal property. We denote the function fields of $X$ and $Y$ by $\kappa(\varepsilon)$ and $\kappa(\eta)$ respectively. This gives us an exact sequence $$ \kappa(\eta) [x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots x_{m}] \longrightarrow \kappa(\varepsilon) \longrightarrow 0. $$ And so $\kappa(\varepsilon)$ is finitely generated as an algebra over $\kappa(\eta)$. But then by Zariski's lemma, this is a finite field extension. Now observe that $\text{Spec } (\kappa(\varepsilon))$ and $\text{Spec } (\kappa(\eta))$ are open sets of $X$ and $Y$ respectively via immerions \begin{align*} \text{Spec }(\kappa(\varepsilon)) \hookrightarrow \text{Spec } A \hookrightarrow X \\ \text{Spec }(\kappa(\eta)) \hookrightarrow \text{Spec } B \hookrightarrow Y \\ \end{align*} and since we already have that $\kappa(\varepsilon)$ is a finite $\kappa(\eta)$-module (vector space), it remains only to show that $f^{-1}(\text{Spec }(\kappa(\eta))) = \text{Spec }(\kappa(\varepsilon))$, or equivalently, that $f^{-1}(\eta) = \{ \varepsilon \}$. Now suppose $p \in X$ is any point such that $f(p) = \eta$. Then we have morphisms $$ \mathcal{O}_{Y, \eta} \longrightarrow \mathcal{O}_{X, p} \longrightarrow \mathcal{O}_{X, \varepsilon} $$ where the first map arises from the morphism of schemes, and the second arises from universal property of the colimit since $p$ is a specialization of $\varepsilon$. But since $\mathcal{O}_{Y, \eta}$ and $\mathcal{O}_{X, \varepsilon}$ are themselves fields, we deduce that $\mathcal{O}_{X, p}$ is a field. So then we find that $p$ is generic, and since the generic point is unique, we have that $p = \varepsilon$.","So I am only just starting to become familiar with schemes, and having had some previous work checked, I seem to have a habit of overlooking subtitles which I would really like to have cleared up early.

That this limit is again an ideal follows from the continuity   of multiplication. I don't know what the limit of vector spaces is. I could imagine how we can take the limit of this using category theory, but I don't know how to interpret it as an ideal again, it would just be $k^2$. I also could imagine that if $k$ is a metric space we could make some sort of metric on linear spaces of a fixed ambient space as well, but for many $k$ that wouldn't work. Of course I also just googled to find out what it could mean, but I didn't find anything. I think the rest of II.3.1 just explains what this limit means intuitively, so that wouldn't really answer my question. So what is this limit? please tell me.",,"['algebraic-geometry', 'reference-request', 'definition', 'limits-colimits', 'affine-schemes']"
