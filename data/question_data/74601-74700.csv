1,How can open spheres be shapes like squares?,How can open spheres be shapes like squares?,,"I'm reading through Schaum's General Topology and I came across the section on equivalent metrics.

I could at least imagine that one was added over time, which would explain the problem. $(ii)$ What is the use of axiom $(4)$ ?

9,What is the intuitive meaning of the Heyting algebra?,What is the intuitive meaning of the Heyting algebra?,,"I'm curious about this. As we all know, classical logic can be described as what is called the Boolean Algebra , in particular, you can think of figuring out the truth of a classical composite statement like ""P and Q"" from the truth values of its components or atomic statements, by applying truth tables to look up the values of the connectives. However, one with a bit more initiation will realize that classical logic is, of course, not the only logic out there - there are others as well, such as the intuitionistic logic in which we try to reject the law of the excluded middle, i.e. that ""P OR NOT P"" must be tautological, and that there may be $P$ where it may not attain truth (Actually, it is one such logic, there are others you can make as well that do the same.). In particular intuitionistic logic is strictly weaker than classical logic meaning that it will never affirm anything that classical does not and anything it does affirm will be affirmed in classical - which also implies that the law of excluded middle is never actually falsified , just not always affirmed , for falsifying the law is equivalent to affirming its negation, i.e ""NOT (P OR NOT P)"", and thus it is tautological in IL that ""NOT NOT (P OR NOT P)"", but the double negation doesn't cancel. Given the ease of the ""truth table"" paradigm, a natural question arises as to whether you can do the same thing for the intuitionistic logic, and it turns out that the answer is, in a sense, yes: but it requires what amounts to a truth table involving not just an infinite, but an uncountably infinite (namely $\beth_1$ - same as the real line!) amount of truth values - which are not , as you might naively think, reals between 0 and 1 as though representing a ""middling"" truth like in another non-classical system called ""fuzzy logic"", at least not in any straightforward way, but rather are something muucchh weerder : in particular, the ""truth values"" are effectively all open sets of the real line (though this may not be the only model but I believe any model has to be at least this big!), where ""false"" is the empty set and ""true"" the whole line. The great stringy middle is just that - the ordering is by inclusion, and this leads to a complex, fibrated structure (in infinitiye-dimensional infinityey infispace!) instead of the naively-expected continuum ""in the middle"". (E.g. one ""fiber"" of truth values is the one formed by the sets $(-a, a)$ with $a \in [0, \infty]$ (no the last bracket is NOT a typo and YES that makes sense) while a different ""fiber"" would be $(100 - a, 100 + a)$ with the same range of $a$ after at least a suitably great ""depth"" $\frac{1}{a}$.)

Why is it that the structure of truth values that we must accept, following some relatively simple modifications or ""weakenings"" of the classical logic, to make the truth tables, must ""suddenly"" explode to not just a large or even infinite but this enormously infinite set that even more has a structure which to me it seems at least you could never guess a priori?

If $N,M \in \mathcal{N}(x)$ then $N\cap M \in \mathcal{N}(x)$. If $N \in \mathcal{N}(x)$ then any set $Y\supseteq N$ is also in $\mathcal{N}(x)$.

Since I started learning topology, I have not understood this definition. The reason is the following. If I take an open set, for example the set defined by $U:=\{x|0<x<1, x\in\mathbb{R}\}=(0,1)$ on $\mathbb{R}$, and then choose a point that is rather near to the boundary of its closure $1$, e.g. $0.9$, then by definition, I can draw an epsilon-ball around this point which is still fully contained in the open set. I choose to take the ball with radius infinitesimally bigger than $0.1*0.9=0.09$ such that the ball extends over $0.99$. Now all the points in that ball must again fulfill the definition that I can draw a ball around them which is contained in the set $U$. So let's take a point of the ball we just drew which is nearer to $1$ than the point we chose first, choose $0.99$. We can draw the epsilon-ball with radius infinitesimally bigger than $0.1^2*0.9$ around this point such that the ball extends over $0.999$. Now we can repeat this process an arbitrary number of times without ever violating the definition of the open set. But if we really do it an infinite amount of times we eventually reach the point $0.9*(1+0.1+0.01+...)=0.\bar 9=1$ which is not in the open set. I know that someone could counter-argue that as we increase the number of repetitions to an infinite amount, we must choose epsilon balls that have a smaller radius to not violate the definition of the open set. But then again: What would be the biggest radius that we are still allowed to choose? So I just can't imagine how an open set can ""work out"", to say it colloquially. More precisely, the only way how I can imagine how every point can have a surrounding that is again made of points which all again must have a surrounding of points, is to have an infinitely extended Set such as $\mathbb{R}$ itself. In that case I can understand that there is just no limit point (or the limit point is infinity) and therefore the above procedure will not lead to a difficulty in my imagination. But for every Set with a finite extend (even though it may has uncountably many points and even though there is an isomorphism from $\mathbb{R}$ to $(0,1)$), it just does not fit into my intuition. (I know intuition is not everything but without intuition, topics for me loose a certain sense of beauty.) Or, from another perspective: Imagine you would drive with a car on the real line. The car shall have a constant velocity, such that its position is given by the function  $x(t):= 2-t$, such that at $t=1$, we reach the boundary of the closure of $(0,1)$, then for $t=1+\epsilon$ with $\epsilon>0$, no matter how small $\epsilon$ is, our car will have entered the open set. Now my intuitive problem with this is that we somehow entered the open set, without passing its first point because there is NO first point in an open set. Or, put differently, us driving the car (or varying $t$ of $x(t)$) is actually a continuous process because $x(t)$ is continuous. And as we pass all the points of the real line in a continuous manner, we could stop anywhere we want (because $t\in\mathbb{R}$). Now when undergoing the transition of the outside of the open set to the inside of the open set, then, because the open set is ultimately just a collection of uncountably many points, we must somehow reach the first point (in my imagination) of that Set but this is impossible for if there was a first point there would not be a surrounding of points around it that is also contained in the set thus contradicting the definition of the open set. So again I cannot imagine this properly. If there would be a first point of the open set, then it would have to be an uncountable number of points away from the boundary of the closure (e.g. $1$) but if there are uncountably many points between the boundary of the closure and the first point, then it can't be the first point. If there is no first point of the open set, I can not imagine how the open set can have a finite extend. So, put into a different question: What would you see if you would look out of the window of a car that drives on the real line into an open set?

75,Relationship between dispersion point and biconnected property,Relationship between dispersion point and biconnected property,,"I am looking at the relationship between the existence of a dispersion point and the biconnected property.  Some definitions: A space $X$ is biconnected if it is connected and is not the union of two disjoint connected subsets, each with at least two points. The point $p\in X$ is a dispersion point for $X$ if $X$ is connected and the subspace $X\setminus \{p\}$ is totally disconnected (where totally disconnected = all connected components are singletons). When the space $X$ has a very small number of elements, the definitions degenerate into trivial cases: To witness that a connected space is not biconnected, one needs at least four elements (two elements in each subset).  So any connected space with at most three elements is biconnected. Also, a space with less than two elements is trivially totally disconnected.  So if $X$ has a single point, that point is trivially a dispersion point.  And if $X$ is connected with exactly 2 points, each of its points is a dispersion point. For size 3, there are examples of $X$ connected (hence biconnected) and without dispersion point.  For example, if the corresponding specialization preorder is a chain, there is no dispersion point ( $X\setminus\{p\}$ is connected for every $p$ ).  Explicitly, take $X=\{a,b,c\}$ with topology $\{\emptyset,\{a\},\{a,b\},X\}$ . Now some results.  First a standard one, which does not depend on the cardinality of $X$ .
