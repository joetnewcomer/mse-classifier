0,Relation between partitions and saturation (quotient spaces),Relation between partitions and saturation (quotient spaces),,"A lot of books seem to define quotient topologies in terms of equivalence classes and partitions of the space. However, Munkres does not. He defines the quotient map in terms strong continuity. Also, he defines it in terms of saturated sets. That is, a continuous map is a quotient map if it maps saturated open sets to open sets. The definition of saturation is, according to Munkres, that a subset C of X is saturated if it contains every $p^{-1}(y)$ that is intersects. However, I have also seen a saturated set being defined as the union of elements of a partition (Elementary Topology by Viro et al.). So, my questions is, what is the relation between the concepts or partitions and saturation? It seems intuitive that partitions will give you saturated sets. However, does every continuous saturated map induce a partition? The main question here is, are these different definitions of a quotient space equivalent? If yes, where can I find a proof?

1,Tychonoff's theorem for products of finite discrete topologies?,Tychonoff's theorem for products of finite discrete topologies?,,"I need the following specific version of Tychonoff's theorem: Suppose $\{X_\alpha\}_\alpha$ is a collection of finite sets endowed with discrete topologies, then $\prod_\alpha X_\alpha$ is compact. I wonder whether there's any direct proof for this specific version, since it's pervasive in mathematics (other than general topology), say the theory of pro-finite groups where infinite Galois theory is based. Many existence theorem is deduced from compactness. I wonder whether there are more direct proofs (but Zorn's lemma is allowed) for this special case. I don't like base many existence theorems (especially some existence of a specific morphism between extension fields) on the black box of Tychonoff's theorem. For example, suppose $A$ is an integrally closed domain with quotient field $F$, and $K/F$ is a normal extension. Let $B$ be the integral closure of $A$ in $K$. Given a prime ideal $P\subsetneq A$, we want to show that $\operatorname{Gal}(K/F)$ acts transitively on prime ideals lying over $P$. We can first prove it for finite extension $K/F$, and deduce the general case from this special case by compactness of $\operatorname{Gal}(K/F)$, see Serre's Local Algebra , say. However, I want to see how this Galois element is constructed without appealing to Tychonoff's theorem. Any help is welcome.

34,An interesting problem from Real Analysis-Abbot,An interesting problem from Real Analysis-Abbot,,"This is taken from ""Undestanding Analysis""- Abbot, Exercise 4.5.8 : Imagine a clock where the hour hand and the minute hand are indistinguishable from each other. Assuming the hands move continuously around the face of the clock, and assuming their positions can be measured with perfect accuracy, is it always possible to determine the time? From my point of view, I think we CAN tell the time because if you observe for, say, 5 minutes, you can see that the minute hand moves faster than the hour hand. Having that, you can determine which one is the hour hand and which one is the minute hand, and hence, you can easily deduct the exact time. However, this is not very mathematical, and although there is a solution for this question, I do not want to look at it so it would be better that I come up with my own original solution.

We prove that if $Y$ is a convex subspace of $L$, then $Y$ is connected. $\quad$ So suppose that $Y$ is the union of the disjoint nonempty sets $A$ and $B$, each of which is open in $Y$. Choose $a\in A$ and $b\in B$: suppose for convenience that $a<b$. The interval $[a,b]$ of points of $L$ is contained in $Y$. Hence $[a,b]$ is the union of the disjoint sets $$A_0=A\cap[a,b]\quad{\rm and}\quad B_0=B\cap[a,b],$$ each of which is open in $[a,b]$ in the subspace topology, which is the same as the order topology.

Thanks!","In Munkres' Topology p.153, we have a proof like this Proof. $\ \ $ Recall that a subspace $Y$ of $L$ is said to be convex if for every pair of points $a,b$ of $Y$ with $a<b$, the entire interval $[a,b]$ of points of $L$ lies in $Y$. We prove that if $Y$ is a convex subspace of $L$, then $Y$ is connected. $\quad$ So suppose that $Y$ is the union of the disjoint nonempty sets $A$ and $B$, each of which is open in $Y$. Choose $a\in A$ and $b\in B$: suppose for convenience that $a<b$. The interval $[a,b]$ of points of $L$ is contained in $Y$. Hence $[a,b]$ is the union of the disjoint sets $$A_0=A\cap[a,b]\quad{\rm and}\quad B_0=B\cap[a,b],$$ each of which is open in $[a,b]$ in the subspace topology, which is the same as the order topology.

A space is hereditarily Lindelöf if every subspace of $X$ is Lindelöf. It is easily shown that closed subspaces of Lindelöf spaces are again Lindelöf (similar to showing that closed subspaces of compact spaces are again compact). I'm trying to show the following Proposition : $[\mathsf{ZF} +$ Countable Choice$]$ A space is hereditarily Lindelöf if and only if every open subspace is Lindelöf. One implication is trivial, but I'm stuck on the other. (I know how to prove it if we know that every open subspace is $\sigma$-compact , but I'm not sure how we can conclude this.)

In other words, can this be generalized to $n$ elements of $E$ and still retain the same properties? Thus I propose the following definition: Definition: Call a subset of $\mathbb{R} ^ k$, which will be denoted $E$, ""generally convex"" if given $ \boldsymbol{x}_i \in E$, for $i = 1,2,...,n$ and the condition $\sum_{1=1}^n \lambda_i = 1$ the following holds: $$ \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i \boldsymbol{x}_i  \in E $$ An open ball is an example of a convex set, and it is also the case that a ball is generally convex. Proof: Let $| \boldsymbol{x} _1 - \boldsymbol{x} |$, $| \boldsymbol{x} _2 - \boldsymbol{x} |$, $...$, $| \boldsymbol{x} _n - \boldsymbol{x} |$, be $n$ balls centred at $\boldsymbol{x}$ with radius $r$. Consider the following: $ | \sum_{i=1} ^n \lambda_i \boldsymbol{x}_i - \boldsymbol{x} | $. This is also a ball of radius $r$. $$| \sum_{i=1} ^n \lambda_i \boldsymbol{x}_i - \boldsymbol{x} | = | \sum_{i=1} ^n \lambda_i (\boldsymbol{x}_i - \boldsymbol{x}) | $$ $$\le  \sum_{i=1} ^n |\lambda_i (\boldsymbol{x}_i - \boldsymbol{x}) |$$ $$< \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i r $$ $$=r$$ This, among other things, satisfies both the definition for convexity and general convexity. This leads me to the following conjecture: Conjecture: Consider a subset of $\mathbb{R} ^k$, $E$. $E$ is convex if and only if $E$ is generally convex. I am having difficulty proving whether or not my conjecture is true. My first thought was that given an element of $E$, it should be able to be expressed as a linear combination of other elements of $E$. And thus using this fact, expand the convexity definition to the general convexity one. The only difficulty with this is figuring out whether or not this can be done for every element of $E$. Online I have been able to find arguments that seem to support this for the case of vector-spaces, but nothing that states it for complex sets. Proof Sketch: Suppose that it is the case that any $\boldsymbol{x}_i \in E$ may be expressed as a linear combination of other elements in $E$. Then given $\lambda \boldsymbol{x}$ as presented in the definition of convexity, the $\boldsymbol{x}$ can be ""split"" into two new elements of $E$. This can be re-iterated until we have the $n$ elements needed for the general convexity definition. Conversely, we just need to ""combine"" $\mathbb{x}_i$'s in the general convexity definition until only the two remaining elements we desire remain. Thus this leads to my questions: How do I go about proving whether my conjecture is true or false (linear combinations or some other method)? Does this ""general convexity"" definition have any mathematical significance?","The definition of convexity can be given as: Definition: Call a subset of $\mathbb{R} ^ k$, which will be denoted $E$, convex if given two elements of $E$, $\boldsymbol{x}$ and $\boldsymbol{y}$ and $0 < \lambda < 1$ the following holds: $$ \lambda \boldsymbol{x} + (1 - \lambda ) \boldsymbol{y} \in E$$ What I have been wondering is whether this is limited to two elements of $E$.

Thus I propose the following definition: Definition: Call a subset of $\mathbb{R} ^ k$, which will be denoted $E$, ""generally convex"" if given $ \boldsymbol{x}_i \in E$, for $i = 1,2,...,n$ and the condition $\sum_{1=1}^n \lambda_i = 1$ the following holds: $$ \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i \boldsymbol{x}_i  \in E $$ An open ball is an example of a convex set, and it is also the case that a ball is generally convex. Proof: Let $| \boldsymbol{x} _1 - \boldsymbol{x} |$, $| \boldsymbol{x} _2 - \boldsymbol{x} |$, $...$, $| \boldsymbol{x} _n - \boldsymbol{x} |$, be $n$ balls centred at $\boldsymbol{x}$ with radius $r$. Consider the following: $ | \sum_{i=1} ^n \lambda_i \boldsymbol{x}_i - \boldsymbol{x} | $. This is also a ball of radius $r$. $$| \sum_{i=1} ^n \lambda_i \boldsymbol{x}_i - \boldsymbol{x} | = | \sum_{i=1} ^n \lambda_i (\boldsymbol{x}_i - \boldsymbol{x}) | $$ $$\le  \sum_{i=1} ^n |\lambda_i (\boldsymbol{x}_i - \boldsymbol{x}) |$$ $$< \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i r $$ $$=r$$ This, among other things, satisfies both the definition for convexity and general convexity. This leads me to the following conjecture: Conjecture: Consider a subset of $\mathbb{R} ^k$, $E$. $E$ is convex if and only if $E$ is generally convex. I am having difficulty proving whether or not my conjecture is true. My first thought was that given an element of $E$, it should be able to be expressed as a linear combination of other elements of $E$. And thus using this fact, expand the convexity definition to the general convexity one. The only difficulty with this is figuring out whether or not this can be done for every element of $E$. Online I have been able to find arguments that seem to support this for the case of vector-spaces, but nothing that states it for complex sets. Proof Sketch: Suppose that it is the case that any $\boldsymbol{x}_i \in E$ may be expressed as a linear combination of other elements in $E$. Then given $\lambda \boldsymbol{x}$ as presented in the definition of convexity, the $\boldsymbol{x}$ can be ""split"" into two new elements of $E$. This can be re-iterated until we have the $n$ elements needed for the general convexity definition. Conversely, we just need to ""combine"" $\mathbb{x}_i$'s in the general convexity definition until only the two remaining elements we desire remain. Thus this leads to my questions: How do I go about proving whether my conjecture is true or false (linear combinations or some other method)?
