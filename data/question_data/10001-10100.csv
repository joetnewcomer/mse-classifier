0,Is $\frac{\textrm{d}y}{\textrm{d}x}$ not a ratio?,Is  not a ratio?,\frac{\textrm{d}y}{\textrm{d}x},"In the book Thomas's Calculus (11th edition) it is mentioned (Section 3.8 pg 225) that the derivative $\frac{\textrm{d}y}{\textrm{d}x}$ is not a ratio. Couldn't it be interpreted as a ratio, because according to the formula $\textrm{d}y = f'(x)\textrm{d}x$ we are able to plug in values for $\textrm{d}x$ and calculate a $\textrm{d}y$ (differential). Then if we rearrange we get $\frac{\textrm{d}y}{\textrm{d}x}$ which could be seen as a ratio. I wonder if the author say this because $\mbox{d}x$ is an independent variable, and $\textrm{d}y$ is a dependent variable, for $\frac{\textrm{d}y}{\textrm{d}x}$ to be a ratio both variables need to be independent.. maybe?","In the book Thomas's Calculus (11th edition) it is mentioned (Section 3.8 pg 225) that the derivative is not a ratio.

3,Calculating the length of the paper on a toilet paper roll,Calculating the length of the paper on a toilet paper roll,,"Fun with Math time. My mom gave me a roll of toilet paper to put it in the bathroom, and looking at it I immediately wondered about this: is it possible, through very simple math, to calculate (with small error) the total paper length of a toilet roll? Writing down some math, I came to this study, which I share with you because there are some questions I have in mind, and because as someone rightly said: for every problem there always are at least 3 solutions. I started by outlining the problem in a geometrical way, namely looking only at the essential: the roll from above, identifying the salient parameters: Parameters $r = $ radius of internal circle, namely the paper tube circle; $R = $ radius of the whole paper roll; $b = R - r = $ ""partial"" radius, namely the difference of two radii as stated. First Point I treated the whole problem in the discrete way. [See the end of this question for more details about what does it mean] Calculation In a discrete way, the problem asks for the total length of the rolled paper, so the easiest way is to treat the problem by thinking about the length as the sum of the whole circumferences starting by radius $r$ and ending with radius $R$. But how many circumferences are there? Here is one of the main points, and then I thought about introducing a new essential parameter, namely the thickness of a single sheet. Notice that it's important to have to do with measurable quantities. Calling $h$ the thickness of a single sheet, and knowing $b$ we can give an estimate of how many sheets $N$ are rolled: $$N = \frac{R - r}{h} = \frac{b}{h}$$ Having to compute a sum, the total length $L$ is then: $$L = 2\pi r + 2\pi (r + h) + 2\pi (r + 2h) + \cdots + 2\pi R$$ or better: $$L = 2\pi (r + 0h) + 2\pi (r + h) + 2\pi (r + 2h) + \cdots + 2\pi (r + Nh)$$ In which obviously $2\pi (r + 0h) = 2\pi r$ and $2\pi(r + Nh) = 2\pi R$. Writing it as a sum (and calculating it) we get: $$ \begin{align} L = \sum_{k = 0}^N\ 2\pi(r + kh) & = 2\pi r + 2\pi R + \sum_{k = 1}^{N-1}\ 2\pi(r + kh) \\\\ & = 2\pi r + 2\pi R + 2\pi \sum_{k = 1}^{N-1} r + 2\pi h \sum_{k = 1}^{N-1} k \\\\ & = 2\pi r + 2\pi R + 2\pi r(N-1) + 2\pi h\left(\frac{1}{2}N(N-1)\right) \\\\ & = 2\pi r N + 2\pi R + \pi hN^2 - \pi h N \end{align} $$ Using now: $N = \frac{b}{h}$; $R = b - a$ and $a = R - b$ (because $R$ is easily measurable), we arrive after little algebra to $$\boxed{L = 4\pi b + 2\pi R\left(\frac{b}{h} - 1\right) - \pi b\left(1 + \frac{b}{h}\right)}$$ Small Example: $h = 0.1$ mm; $R = 75$ mm; $b = 50$ mm thence $L = 157$ meters which might fit. Final Questions: 1) Could it be a good approximation? 2) What about the $\gamma$ factor? Namely the paper compression factor? 3) Could exist a similar calculation via integration over a spiral path?

For example, $f(2^{-t}) = 1/(t+1)$ , so $f(1/2) = 1/2$ , $f(1/4) = 1/3$ and so on. More complicated examples are $f(5/8) = f(2^{-1} + 2^{-3}) = 1/2 + 1/(4\cdot 3) = 7/12$ and $$ f(2/3) = f\left(\sum_{k \geq 0}2^{-(2k+1)}\right) = \sum_{k \geq 0} \frac{1}{(2k+2)\binom{2k+1}{k}} = \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{27}}.$$ The function $f$ is a continuous increasing function satisfying $f(0) = 0$ , $f(1) = 1$ , and $f(1-t) = 1-f(t)$ for $t \in [0,1]$ .

The permutation $1/8,1/2,1,1/4$ is pivotal for $t \in (5/8,1]$ . For all $n \geq 2$ we have $f_n(1/2) = 1/2$ , since $\pi$ is pivotal iff $1$ appears before $1/2$ in $\pi$ . The general formula for $f$ is derived in a similar way. We leave it to the reader to figure out how $f_n$ measures some Shapley value.

37,Is the derivative the natural logarithm of the left-shift?,Is the derivative the natural logarithm of the left-shift?,,"(Disclaimer: I'm a high school student, and my knowledge of mathematics extends only to some elementary high school calculus. I don't know if what I'm about to do is valid mathematics.) I noticed something really neat the other day. Suppose we define $L$ as a ""left-shift operator"" that takes a function $f(x)$ and returns $f(x+1)$. Clearly, $(LLL\ldots LLLf)(x)=f(x+(\text{number of $L$s}))$, so it would seem a natural extension to denote $(L^hf)(x)=f(x+h)$. Now, by the definition of the Taylor series, $f(x+h)=\sum\limits_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{k!}\frac{d^kf}{dx^k}\bigg|_{x}h^k$. Let's rewrite this as $\sum\limits_{k=0}^\infty \left(\frac{\left(h\frac{d}{dx}\right)^k}{k!}f\right)(x)$. Now, we can make an interesting observation: $\sum\limits_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\left(h\frac{d}{dx}\right)^k}{k!}$ is simply the Taylor series for $e^u$ with $u=h\frac{d}{dx}$. Let's rewrite the previous sum as $\left(e^{h\frac{d}{dx}}f\right)(x)$. This would seem to imply that $(L^hf)(x)=\left(e^{h\frac{d}{dx}}f\right)(x)$, or equivalently, $L=e^\frac{d}{dx}$. We might even say that $\frac{d}{dx}=\ln L$. My question is, does what I just did have any mathematical meaning? Is it valid? I mean, I've done a bit of creative number-shuffling, but how does one make sense of exponentiating or taking the logarithm of an operator? What, if any, significance does a statement like $\frac{d}{dx}=\ln L$ have?","(Disclaimer: I'm a high school student, and my knowledge of mathematics extends only to some elementary high school calculus.

Suppose we define $L$ as a ""left-shift operator"" that takes a function $f(x)$ and returns $f(x+1)$. Clearly, $(LLL\ldots LLLf)(x)=f(x+(\text{number of $L$s}))$, so it would seem a natural extension to denote $(L^hf)(x)=f(x+h)$. Now, by the definition of the Taylor series, $f(x+h)=\sum\limits_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{k!}\frac{d^kf}{dx^k}\bigg|_{x}h^k$. Let's rewrite this as $\sum\limits_{k=0}^\infty \left(\frac{\left(h\frac{d}{dx}\right)^k}{k!}f\right)(x)$. Now, we can make an interesting observation: $\sum\limits_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\left(h\frac{d}{dx}\right)^k}{k!}$ is simply the Taylor series for $e^u$ with $u=h\frac{d}{dx}$. Let's rewrite the previous sum as $\left(e^{h\frac{d}{dx}}f\right)(x)$. This would seem to imply that $(L^hf)(x)=\left(e^{h\frac{d}{dx}}f\right)(x)$, or equivalently, $L=e^\frac{d}{dx}$. We might even say that $\frac{d}{dx}=\ln L$. My question is, does what I just did have any mathematical meaning? Is it valid? I mean, I've done a bit of creative number-shuffling, but how does one make sense of exponentiating or taking the logarithm of an operator? What, if any, significance does a statement like $\frac{d}{dx}=\ln L$ have?",,"['calculus', 'functional-analysis', 'power-series', 'taylor-expansion', 'finite-differences']"
38,Cardioid in coffee mug?,Cardioid in coffee mug?,,"I've been learning about polar curves in my Calc class and the other day I saw this suspiciously $r=1-\cos \theta$  looking thing in my coffee cup (well actually $r=1-\sin \theta$ if we're being pedantic.) Some research revealed that it's called a caustic. I started working out why it would be like this, but hit a snag. Here's what I did so far: Consider the polar curves $r=1-\cos \theta$ and $r=1$. Since for a light ray being reflected off a surface (or the inside of my cup) the $\angle$ of incidence =$\angle$ of reflection, a point on the circle $(1,\theta)\to(1,2\theta)$. It looks like this has something to do with the tangent lines, so I pretend there's an $xy$ plane centered at the pole to find the slope of the line connecting the points. Since it's the unit circle the corresponding rectangular coordinates are $(\cos \theta, \sin \theta)$ and $(\cos 2\theta, \sin 2\theta).$ So  $$m={\sin 2\theta-\sin \theta \over \cos 2\theta-\cos \theta}$$ now we see if it matches up with the slope of the lines tangent to the cardioid $$\frac{dy}{dx}={r'\sin \theta+r \cos \theta \over r' \cos \theta - r \sin \theta}={\sin^2\theta - \cos^2 \theta +\cos \theta \over 2\sin \theta \cos \theta -\sin\theta}={\cos \theta - \cos 2\theta\over \sin 2\theta-\sin \theta}$$ They're similar, but not identical. In particular $\frac{dy}{dx}=-\frac1m$. What error have I made, or what have I overlooked conceptually? Thanks in advance.","I've been learning about polar curves in my Calc class and the other day I saw this suspiciously $r=1-\cos \theta$  looking thing in my coffee cup (well actually $r=1-\sin \theta$ if we're being pedantic.)

Anyway, when integrating log-sin integrals one can often times use the famous identity $$\displaystyle -\ln(2\sin(x/2))=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{\cos(kx)}{k}$$ by switching sum and integral, integrating, then evaluating the sums. However, this is only valid when $x\neq \pm \pi,\pm2\pi,\ldots$ . So, just for the heck of it, I decided to do something I thought would not be viable but have done it anyway. I integrated $$\displaystyle \int_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{x^{2}\cos^{2}(kx)}{k^{2}},$$ evaluated the resulting sums and arrived at $\displaystyle \frac{41{\pi}^{5}}{180}$ . Now, take the integral $$\displaystyle \int_{0}^{\pi}x^{2}\ln^{2}(2\cos(x/2))dx=\frac{11{\pi}^{5}}{180}.$$ This one can be done by using Cauchy's cosine formula, differentiating, and so on. Anyway, note that when I add the two results, the correct result for the integral at hand is obtained. $$\displaystyle \frac{41{\pi}^{5}}{180}+\frac{11{\pi}^{5}}{180}=\frac{13{\pi}^{5}}{45}.$$ By quandary/query is why does this happen to work?. A fluke? Does that cosine sum represent something that when evaluated and added to the above log-cos integral happens to be equivalent to the log-sine integral in question?. See what I am trying to explain?. I done something I knew I was not supposed to, but it happened to work out. If viable, what would $\displaystyle \int_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{x^{2}\cos^{2}(kx)}{k^{2}}$ represent such that when it is added to $\displaystyle \int_{0}^{\pi}x^{2}\ln^{2}(2\cos(x/2))dx=\frac{11{\pi}^{5}}{180}$ equals $\displaystyle \int_{0}^{2\pi}x^{2}\ln^{2}(2\sin(x/2))dx=\frac{13{\pi}^{5}}{45}$ . I knew I could not just square the cosine and multiply by $x^2$ . But,sometimes it can be done due to Parseval, i.e., $\displaystyle \ln^{2}(2\sin(x/2))=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{\cos(nx)\cos(kx)}{nk}$ . Then, because $\displaystyle \int_{0}^{\pi}\cos(nx)\cos(kx)dx=0, \;\ n\neq k$ , one can integrate $\displaystyle \int_{0}^{\pi}\frac{\cos^{2}(kx)}{k^{2}}$ , then sum. This works for $2\pi$ as well, but that $x^2$ term tends to throw a wrench in things But I do not think I can do this in my case because of the $x^2$ term.  Or can I?. I was surprised when I saw this. I thought perhaps I stumbled onto a cool way to evaluate this, but I am not entirely sure what I have. Or, if anyone has their own clever method?.

62,Escaping infinitely many pursuers,Escaping infinitely many pursuers,,"The fugitive is at the origin. They move at a speed of 1. There's a guard at every integer coordinate except the origin. A guard's speed is 1/100. The fugitive and the guards move simultaneously and continuously. At any moment, the guards only move towards the current position of the fugitive , i.e. a guard's trajectory is a pursuit curve . If they're within 1/100 distance from a guard, the fugitive is caught. The game is played on $\mathbb{R}^2$ . Can the fugitive avoid capture forever? What I know: The distance between two guards is always non-increasing, but the farther away from the fugitive, the slower that distance decreases. If the fugitive runs along a straight line, they will always be caught by some far away guard. For example, if the fugitive starts at $(0.5, 0)$ and runs due north, they will be caught by a guard at about $(0, \frac{50^{100}}{4})$ . Consult radiodrome for calculation. If there're just 2 guards at distance 1 from each other, then the fugitive can always find a path to safely pass between them. This is true regardless of the pair's distance and relative positions to the fugitive. The fugitive can escape if they're just ""enclosed"" by guards who're at distance 1 from each other: The shape of the fence doesn't have to be rectangular. Circles or other shapes don't prevent escape either, regardless of the size. 3 and 4 are nontrivial, but can be proved by geometry argument alone without calculus.

77,When does L' Hopital's rule fail?,When does L' Hopital's rule fail?,,"This thought jumped out of me during my calculus teaching seminar. It is well known that the classical L'Hospital rule claims that for the $\frac{0}{0}$ indeterminate case, we have: $$ \lim_{x\rightarrow A}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=\lim_{x\rightarrow A}\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} $$ where the later could take any value including $\infty$. Here we assume that right hand side limit exist. However, to apply it one often has to take the derivative of $f'(x)$ again at $A$, and in principle one assumes by repeatedly applying this rule we can resolve the problem by plug in the value into the function's derivative at $A$. My question is, what if the student ask if it is possible for $\lim_{x\rightarrow A} f(x),\lim_{x\rightarrow A} f'(x)\cdots \lim^{n}_{x\rightarrow A}f^{n}(x)$ be all zero for any $n$, so the rule 'fails'. How should we answer the question properly? For example, consider the well-known non-analytic smooth function : $$f(x)= \begin{cases} e^{-1/x}& x> 0\\ 0& x\le 0 \end{cases} $$ It is a trivial exercise to verify that $f^{n}(0)=0$ for any $n\in \mathbb{N}$. Now using L'Hospital rule we compute (as if we are a low level student) $$ 1=\lim_{x\rightarrow 0^{+}}\frac{f(x)}{f(x)}=\lim_{x\rightarrow 0^{+}}\frac{f'(x)}{f'(x)}=\lim_{x\rightarrow 0^{+}}\frac{f''(x)}{f''(x)}\cdots =\frac{0}{0}=? $$ as the chain does not stop if the student applies the rule faithfully and blindly. This is a silly example, but in general for non-analytical functions I think this kind of thing could happen. And there should be more non-analytical functions than analytical functions.

But isn't the same true for degrees? As $dx$ approaches $\theta$ degrees then $\sin(dx \,\text{degrees})$ still approaches $0$. But I've come to the understanding that $\sin(dx \,\text{degrees})$ approaches $0$ almost $60$ times slower, so if $\sin(dx \,\text{radians})$ can be replaced with $dx$ then $\sin(dx \,\text{degrees})$ would have to be replaced with $(\pi/180)$ times $dx$ degrees. But the question remains of why it works perfectly for radians. How do we know that we can replace $\sin(dx)$ with just $dx$ without any kind of conversion applied like we need for degrees? It's not good enough to just say that we can see that $\sin(dx)$ approaches $dx$ as $dx$ gets very small.

Here's how I came up with : I knew from here that: And since this result is very similar to the one from above, I tried to show that , equivalent to: I also noticed that we have: Of course now it's trivial to deduce that as we know the result for , but I'm interested to show that relationship without making use of the result or by calculating any of the integrals.
