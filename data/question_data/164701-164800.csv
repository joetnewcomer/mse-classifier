At a glance my judgement is YES, it is uniformly integrable.

So I let $E \subset R$ such that $\mu (E)<\delta$ then $\int_E|f_n|=\int|f_n|\chi_E \leq \mu (E)<\delta$. So in this case $\epsilon =\delta$.

My goal is to show that $\varphi$ is differentiable  on $J$, with the obvious derivative $\varphi'(p)=\int_X |f|^p\log|f| d\mu$. I have succeeded in proving this under the assumption that $\log|f|\in L^1$. My argument goes as follows: Let $p\in J$ and $(p_n)_{n\geq 1}$ be a sequence in $J$ converging to $p$ with $p_n\ne p$ for all $n\geq 1$. Choose a point $q\in J$ such that $p_n<q$ for all $n\geq 1$, a small $\epsilon>0$ such that $q+\epsilon\in J$, and a constant $C_{\epsilon}$ satisfying the inequality $\log t\leq C_{\epsilon}t^{\epsilon}$ for all $t\geq 1$. We have $$\frac{\varphi(p_n)-\varphi(p)}{p_n-p}=\int_{|f|>1}\frac{|f(x)|^{p_n}-|f(x)|^{p}}{p_n-p} d\mu+\int_{|f|\leq 1}\frac{|f(x)|^{p_n}-|f(x)|^{p}}{p_n-p} d\mu$$ and the mean value theorem gives (for each $x$) points $p'_n$ lying between $p_n$ and $p$ such that $\frac{|f(x)|^{p_n}-|f(x)|^{p}}{p_n-p}=|f(x)|^{p'_n} \log|f(x)|$. By our choice of $q$, we have $p'_n<q$ regardless of $x$ and $$\left|\frac{|f(x)|^{p_n}-|f(x)|^{p}}{p_n-p}\right|=|f(x)|^{p'_n}|\log|f(x)||\leq|f(x)|^q\log|f(x)|\leq C_{\epsilon}|f(x)|^{q+\epsilon}$$ whenever $|f(x)|>1$, and $$|f(x)|^{p'_n}|\log|f(x)||\leq|\log|f(x)||$$ whenever $|f(x)|\leq1$. Since $q+\epsilon\in J$, both the functions $|f|^{q+\epsilon}$ and $|\log|f||$ are in $L^1$ and the dominated convergence theorem applies. Hence we have $$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{\varphi(p_n)-\varphi(p)}{p_n-p}=\int_{|f|>1} |f|^p\log|f| d\mu+\int_{|f|\leq 1} |f|^p\log|f| d\mu=\int_X |f|^p\log|f| d\mu$$ and we conclude that $\varphi$ is differentiable at $p$ with the derivative $\int_X |f|^p\log|f| d\mu$. As above, I have used the additional assumption $\log|f|\in L^1$ in the argument. My questions are: Can this assumption be dropped? Does the expression $\int_X |f|^p\log|f| d\mu$ still make sense when $\log|f|\notin L^1$ ? When $\log|f|\notin L^1$, the integral $\int_X \log|f| d\mu$ exists but equals $-\infty$. In this case, if we further assume that $\mu(X)=1$, is it true that $\lim_{p\rightarrow 0}\Vert f\Vert_p=0$? Please enlighten me. Any advice on the questions or the argument I have made is welcome.

7,On a Clarkson-like inequality in $L^p$,On a Clarkson-like inequality in,L^p,"I'm currently reading the book ""Topics in Almost Everywhere Convergence"" by A. Garsia. At a certain point, he claims the validity of the following inequality, for $f, g \in L^p(X, \mathcal{A}, \mu)$, $\mu$ being a probability measure: \begin{equation*} \|  f - g \|^{p}_{p} \leq C_{p} \left[ \| f \|_{p}^{p} + \| g \|_{p}^{p} -2 \left\| \frac{f + g}{2} \right\|_{p}^{p} \right]^{\min \{1, p/2\}} \end{equation*} for any $p>1$, where $C_p$ is a constant and $f, g$ are on the unit ball. If $p\geq 2$, I see that this is Clarkson's inequality. However, for $1 < p <2$, it doesn't seem to be that simple. What bugs me the most is that this result is accompanied by the following footnote: This can be established by expressing $$|f|^p + |g|^p - 2 \left| \frac{f + g}{2} \right|^p$$ as an integral involving the second derivative of $|x|^p$. The constant $C_p$ tends to infinity as $p \to 1$. The above suggests that there is some unified approach for all values of $p$ and possibly elementary.

To with $F:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ and $x\in\mathbb{R}$ , we define $$T_F(x) = \sup\{\sum_{1}^{n}|F(x_j) - F(x_{j-1}|:n\in\mathbb{N},-\infty < x_0 < \ldots < x_n = x\}$$ $T_F$ is called the total variation of $F$ . We observe that the sums in the definition of $T_F$ are made bigger if the additional subdivision points $x_j$ are added. Hence, if $a < b$ , the deinition of $T_F(b)$ is unaffected if we assume that $a$ is always one of the subdivision points.

Could anyone come up with a cited reference about this space?","The following is a theorem in the preliminary material section of Constantin and Foias's ""Navier-Stokes Equations"": Let $\Omega\subset\Bbb{R}^n$ be an open bounded set with locally   Lipschitz boundary. If a distribution $p\in D'(\Omega)$ has all its first derivatives $D_ip$ in $L^2(\Omega)$ then $p\in L^2(\Omega)$ and    $$  \|p\|_{L^2(\Omega)/\Bbb{R}}\leq C(\Omega)\|\nabla p\|_{L^2(\Omega)^n}  $$ If a distribution $p$ has all its first derivatives in    $H^{-1}(\Omega)$ then $p\in L^2(\Omega)$ and    $$     \|p\|_{L^2(\Omega)/\Bbb{R}}\leq C(\Omega)\|\nabla  p\|_{H^{-1}(\Omega)^n}    $$ In both cases, if no restriction is imposed on $\partial\Omega$ it   follows that $p\in L_{\hbox{loc}}^2(\Omega)$. By   $\|p\|_{L^2(\Omega)/\Bbb{R}}$ we mean $$  \inf_{c\in\Bbb{R}}\|p-c\|_{L^2(\Omega)}= \|p-\frac{\int_\Omega p \  dx}{|\Omega|}\cdot 1\|_{L^2(\Omega)}. $$ The space $L^2(\Omega)/\Bbb{R}$ defined in the theorem looks quite strange to me (since the notation usually suggests a quotient space).

64,Looking for a clarification of the Suslin $\mathcal{A}$-Operation with a (finite) example,Looking for a clarification of the Suslin -Operation with a (finite) example,\mathcal{A},"I have a problem concerning the output of (and the intuition behind) the Suslin $\mathcal{A}$-Operation . More specifically, I really don't see exactly what the output of it really is (even if I can actually use it to prove some very basic things), and I think this hampers my general understanding. In order to get some intuition, I decided to translate everything in terms of finite sets (this one should be an instantiation of the Alexandroff Operation). By doing this, I also added some numbered questions to emphasise my problems. This is the basic setting: $X = \{ a, b \}$ $A = \{0, 1 \}$ $A_e = \{ a, b \}$, $A_0 = \{ a \}$, $A_1 = \{ b \}$, $A_{00} = \varnothing = A_{10} = A_{01} = A_{11}$ where a Suslin scheme is a function of the form $A : A^{<\mathbb{N}} \to 2^X$. So, we have that $$ \mathcal{A}_2 ( \{ A_s \} ) = \bigcup_{\alpha \in A^{\mathbb{N}}} \bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} A_{\alpha|n} \hspace{7cm} (\square),$$ where $\{ A_s \}$ denotes the family of all the $A$ sets previously considered (this is a Suslin scheme that is also regular), and $\alpha|n$ denotes the initial segment $\alpha = ( \alpha_0, \alpha_1 , \dots, \alpha_{n-1})$ of length $n$ of a $\alpha \in A^{\mathbb{N}}$. Hence we have that $$x \in \mathcal{A}_2 ( \{ A_s \} ) \Longleftrightarrow \exists \alpha \in A^{\mathbb{N}} : \forall n \in \mathbb{N} \ ( x \in A_{\alpha|n}) \hspace{3cm}(*).$$ Now, my problems start here. 1. Does this actually means that in this case, with finite $X$, the $\mathcal{A}$-Operation gives an empty result? This is my hypothesis because my intuition is the following. We are in a finite context, and no matter what $n \in \mathbb{N}$ we pick, still the process basically ends at the second digit (i.e. $A_{**}$) which is associated with the empty set, and hence there is no element that can fit the RHS of $(*)$. 2. Is this line of reasoning correct? If this is the case, then a natural consideration is that the power of the Suslin $\mathcal{A}$-Operation really comes from infinite spaces, where this process can go on indefinitely. 3. Again, is this correct? I am really looking forward to any feedback. Thank you in advance for your time. PS: The notation I used should be rather standard in set theory, but I will clarify if needed.","I have a problem concerning the output of (and the intuition behind) the Suslin $\mathcal{A}$-Operation .
