Question: Does there exist a Banach space $X$ , an operator $T:X\rightarrow X$ with operator norm $\|T\|_{op}\leq 1$ and a sequence of polynomials $p_n:\mathbb{C}\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ so that $\sup_{x\in D} |p_n(x)|\rightarrow 0$ as $n$ goes to infinity, where $D$ is the unit dist, but $\|p_n(T)\|_{op}=1$ (or any constant greater than zero that is independent on $n$ )? Equivalently, the map $p\mapsto p(T)$ from $(\mathrm{Poly}(D),\|\cdot\|_\infty)$ to $(\mathcal{L}(X),\|\cdot\|_{op})$ is not continuous. Two notes: (1) It is not likely, but it could be that there are no such examples, in that case a proof or reference would be nice :-) (2) It is much appreciated if you can provide an example in the case where $X=L^p(\Omega)$ for every $p>2$ , where $\Omega$ is some measured space (say $\Omega=[0,1]$ ). Discussion: I do know that there is no counterexample in the case where $X$ is a Hilbert space (edit: and $T$ is normal), but that result requires the use of Gelfand theory, which is not valid for arbitrary Banach spaces (because we do not have natural $C^\star$ algebras). Let $H$ be a Hilbert space and $T:H\rightarrow H$ be a continuous operator. For a polynomial $p(x) = \sum_n a_n x^n$ we can define a new operator $p(T) = \sum_n a_n\cdot T^n$ on $H$ . A well known, seemingly trivial, but extremely deep result in functional analysis is the fact that the operator norm of $p(T)$ is exactly the supremum of $p$ on the spectrum of $T$ . The main key point in the proof is the fact that for an operator $T$ , if $\sigma(T)$ is the spectrum of $T$ then $$\|T\|_{op} = \max \sigma(T).$$ This combined with the fact that $\sigma(p(T))=p(\sigma(T))$ gives the assertion above immediately. (The equality, $\|T\|_{op} = \max \sigma(T)$ , does not seem to be true for arbitrary Banach spaces, at least I fail to incorporate the original proof, because Gelfand theory is not valid.) Now, if we assume that $\|T\|_{op}\leq 1$ , we can already deduce that $\sigma(T)\subseteq D$ . Therefore, if $p_n$ are polynomials so that $\|p_n\|_{\infty,D}\rightarrow 0$ , then $\|p_n(T)\|_{op}\leq \|p_n\|_{\infty,D}\rightarrow 0$ . This proves that if $X$ is an Hilbert space then there is no example of the form I am looking for. I suspect that this is not true for arbitrary Banach spaces. A concrete example will help me greatly.","Let me go straight to the question and then write some discussion about it.

Equivalently, the map from to is not continuous. Two notes: (1) It is not likely, but it could be that there are no such examples, in that case a proof or reference would be nice :-) (2) It is much appreciated if you can provide an example in the case where for every , where is some measured space (say ). Discussion: I do know that there is no counterexample in the case where is a Hilbert space (edit: and is normal), but that result requires the use of Gelfand theory, which is not valid for arbitrary Banach spaces (because we do not have natural algebras). Let be a Hilbert space and be a continuous operator. For a polynomial we can define a new operator on . A well known, seemingly trivial, but extremely deep result in functional analysis is the fact that the operator norm of is exactly the supremum of on the spectrum of . The main key point in the proof is the fact that for an operator , if is the spectrum of then This combined with the fact that gives the assertion above immediately. (The equality, , does not seem to be true for arbitrary Banach spaces, at least I fail to incorporate the original proof, because Gelfand theory is not valid.) Now, if we assume that , we can already deduce that . Therefore, if are polynomials so that , then . This proves that if is an Hilbert space then there is no example of the form I am looking for. I suspect that this is not true for arbitrary Banach spaces. A concrete example will help me greatly.","X T:X\rightarrow X \|T\|_{op}\leq 1 p_n:\mathbb{C}\rightarrow \mathbb{C} \sup_{x\in D} |p_n(x)|\rightarrow 0 n D \|p_n(T)\|_{op}=1 n p\mapsto p(T) (\mathrm{Poly}(D),\|\cdot\|_\infty) (\mathcal{L}(X),\|\cdot\|_{op}) X=L^p(\Omega) p>2 \Omega \Omega=[0,1] X T C^\star H T:H\rightarrow H p(x) = \sum_n a_n x^n p(T) = \sum_n a_n\cdot T^n H p(T) p T T \sigma(T) T \|T\|_{op} = \max \sigma(T). \sigma(p(T))=p(\sigma(T)) \|T\|_{op} = \max \sigma(T) \|T\|_{op}\leq 1 \sigma(T)\subseteq D p_n \|p_n\|_{\infty,D}\rightarrow 0 \|p_n(T)\|_{op}\leq \|p_n\|_{\infty,D}\rightarrow 0 X","['functional-analysis', 'operator-theory', 'lp-spaces', 'operator-algebras', 'gelfand-representation']"

I'm a bit stuck, though.  It's clear that Baire tells us that one of the sets $\bigcup_{n=k}^\infty B(r_n,2^{-n})$ for $k \in \mathbb{N}$ must not be dense, but I'm not sure how to use this information to prove the result.  Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated. EDIT: Here are the details on my above claim.  Set $U_k = \bigcup_{n=k}^\infty B(r_n,2^{-n})$, which is clearly open.  Suppose, BWOC, that each $U_k$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}^N$.  Then Baire says that $\bigcap_{k=0}^\infty U_k$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}^N$, but on the other hand by construction $\bigcap_{k=0}^\infty U_k = \varnothing$.  This contradiction means we must have $E_k$ not dense for some $k$. EDIT 2: As pointed out in the comments below, this argument doesn't seem to fly.  So, back to square one...",,"['real-analysis', 'functional-analysis', 'baire-category']"

89,Showing Lipschitz continuity of Sobolev function,Showing Lipschitz continuity of Sobolev function,,"Is there any problem with the following, please advise: Take $I \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$ convex, closed and bounded. I want to show that if I have $u_{m} \rightharpoonup^{*} u$ in $W^{1,\infty}(I)$ and $\Vert \nabla u_{m} \Vert_{L^{\infty}(I)} \leq \sigma$ where $\sigma > 0$. It then follows that $u$ is Lipshitz continuous and has $\sigma$ as a Lipschitz constant. We have that $\Vert \nabla u \Vert_{L^{\infty}} \leq \liminf\limits_{m\rightarrow \infty} \Vert \nabla u_{m} \Vert \leq \sigma$ since the norm is lower semi-continuous. We first note that since $u \in W^{1,\infty}(I)$ it follows that $u$ is locally Lipschitz (since $I$ is compact it follows that $u$ is Lipschitz on $I$). So $u$ is differentiable almost everywhere in the classic sense of differentiation. We now use the following: Consider $\phi(t):= u(tx + (1-t)y)$    $\text{     }$     for  $\text{          }$     $t \in [0,1]$ Then $\phi(1) - \phi(0)  = \int_{0}^{1}{\phi}^{'}(t)dt = \int_{0}^{1}\nabla u(tx + (1-t)y)\cdot(x-y)dt$ $\therefore |u(x) - u(y)| \leq \int_{0}^{1}|u(tx+(1-t)y)||x-y|dt \leq \Vert \nabla u \Vert_{L^{\infty}}|x-y| \leq \sigma|x-y|$ This shows that $u$ is locally Lipschitz with Lipschitz constant $\sigma$.
