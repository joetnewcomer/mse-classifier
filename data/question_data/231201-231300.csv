2,Does this set $\{x + 1 : x \in \mathbb{R}\}$ have an upper and lower bound?,Does this set  have an upper and lower bound?,\{x + 1 : x \in \mathbb{R}\},"I understood the concepts of maximum, minimum, lower and upper bound, supremum and infimum, but I am still not so confident when it comes to say if a set has those or not. In one of the exercises I have to do, it's asking us to say if the sets are bounded from below or above, and to give 2 upper and 2 lower bounds if they exits. I will proceed through all the sets, and I will try to give my answer, so that you can tell me where I am wrong. a) $\{ 1, 4, 9, 16, 25\}$ This set is bounded from below and from above.  Two examples of lower bound are: $1$ and $0$, since for all $x$ in the set, $1\leq x$ and $0\leq x$. Two examples of upper bound are: $25$ and $26$, since for all $x$ in the set, $25 \geq x$ and $26\geq x$. b) $\{ x \in \mathbb{R} : x < 0\}$ This set is bounded from above, but not from below, since it goes to $-\infty$. Two examples of upper bounds are $0$ and $1$, since for any number $x$ in the set, $x \leq 0$ and $x \leq 1$. The range of this set can be represented by: $$\left(-\infty, 0\right)$$ c) $\{1 + \frac{1}{2^n} : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ This set is bounded from below and above. Two examples of upper bound are $\frac{3}{2}$ or any other number greater than $\frac{3}{2}$, since for any number $x$ in the set $x \leq \frac{3}{2}$. Two examples of lower bound are $1$ or any other number less than $1$, since for any number $x$ in the set, $1 \leq x$. Basically, the set can be represented with the following range: $$\left(1, \frac{3}{2}\right]$$ d) $\{x + 1 : x \in \mathbb{R}\}$ This set has no upper bound or lower bound, if we do not consider $-\infty$ or $\infty$ as respectively the lower and upper bound. This set basically represents the real numbers, right? e) $[0, 2] \cup (3, 4)$ In this case, I have a doubt. Are we talking about ranges of real numbers or natural numbers? Because if we are talking about natural numbers, then the upper bounds could be $3$ and $4$, since they $\not\in [0, 2] \cup (3, 4)$. Otherwise the 2 upper bounds could be $4$ or $5$.

Given the definition at hand, we know that $f$ sends one $x\in C$ to one $f(x)\in D$ but as $f$ is not univocal to the left, sometimes $f^{-1}$ can send one $f(x)\in D$ to more than one $x$. And hence It's possible to send one $x \in C$ to $f(x)\in D$ such that $f^{-1}$ sends it back to $x\in C$ and other $x'\notin C$.",,['elementary-set-theory']

Although my motivation for asking this question is to have something you can show to students, to show them what nice things they already can prove with the results they've learned about cardinals, feel free to add answers on any level. EDIT: As pointed out by Arthur Fischer in his comment , there already is a rather similar question: Looking for a problem where one could use a cardinality argument to find a solution. A difference is that the question asks about examples of the type , where is countable and is uncountable. (But as you can see some answers, including the answer that is accepted , are about larger cardinalities, too.)",A\setminus B B A,"['elementary-set-theory', 'cardinals', 'big-list']"

Show that $p$ is closed, i.e. for each V closed in $(X,\mathscr{T}_X)$, $p(V)$ is closed in $(\mathbb{R},\mathscr{T}_\mathbb{R})$.

Then consider $p(V)$ for $V$ in $\mathcal{A}$. For $V=X\backslash U$ where $U \in \mathcal{B}_2$, $p(V)=\mathbb{R}$, and for  $V=X\backslash U$ where $U \in \mathcal{B}_1$, $p(V)=(\mathbb{R}\backslash (\alpha,\beta)) \cup \{0\}$.

But, for sets $U_\lambda, \lambda \in \Lambda$ an indexing set, and $f$ a map, $f(\bigcup\limits_{\lambda \in \Lambda} U_\lambda)=\bigcup\limits_{\lambda \in \Lambda}f(U_\lambda)$. So when proving certain things about open sets reduces to proving it for a basis, and I am assuming because of the corresponding image rule:  $f(\bigcap\limits_{\lambda \in \Lambda} U_\lambda)\subseteq\bigcap\limits_{\lambda \in \Lambda}f(U_\lambda)$, that I can't conclude the map is closed using the basis for closed sets?

I was asking about the property of substitution because aparently when using ""$=$"" everything can be substituted whereas it is not the case when using ""~"". Let's define, for example, ""$\equiv_{n}$"" such that $\forall a,b\in \mathbb{Z}(a\equiv_{n} b \iff n|b-a)$. Now, suppose that $a\equiv_{n} b$ and $b=6^{m}$ for some $m\in \mathbb{Z}$. Then $a\equiv_{n}6^{m}$ by substitution. Also if $m=k+7$ we can again make a substitution to get $a\equiv_{n}6^{k+7}$. But, this same process cannot always be done if we consider $b\equiv_{n}6^{m}$ and $m\equiv_{n}k+7$. Since both ""$=$"" and ""~"" are transitive, reflexive and symmetric my guess was then that substitution is a property that belongs to $""=""$ but no to ""~"", but I'm not sure and I'm totally confused.",,"['elementary-set-theory', 'logic']"

The part I need you to check starts here: To show $\le$, assume that we have strict inequality $ \sum_{\xi < \alpha}\kappa_\xi < \kappa $. We distinguish two cases: $\kappa$ is either an infinite successor cardinal or a limit cardinal. If $\kappa = \left ( \sum_{\xi < \alpha}\kappa_\xi \right )^+$ is an infinite successor cardinal then by corollary 15 (on the same page) $\kappa$ cannot be the union of fewer than $\kappa$ sets each of which has cardinality less than $\kappa$. But $\bigcup_{\xi < \alpha}f(\xi) = f[\alpha] = \kappa $ where $|f(\xi)| = \kappa_\xi < \kappa$ and $\alpha < \kappa$ which would be a contradiction. Hence $\kappa$ must be a limit cardinal so that there exists a cardinal $\eta$ with $\sum_{\xi < \alpha}\kappa_\xi < \eta < \kappa$. But $f$ is cofinal in $\kappa$ hence there is $\xi$ such that $f(\xi) \ge \eta$. Then $\kappa_\xi = |f(\xi)| \ge \eta$. Which is a contradiction. We have: And also, the reason why I am asking this question: in the proof in the book, $\kappa_\xi$ are defined as $\kappa_\xi = \left | f(\xi) \setminus \sum_{\eta < \xi} f(\eta) \right |$.",,"['elementary-set-theory', 'cardinals', 'ordinals']"

I would like to know if both definitions are equivalent. I will use the following notation: if $A$ is a subset of a topological space $X$ , then $A^{(0)}=A$ and $A^{(n+1)}$ is the set of accumulation points of $A^{(n)}$ . This can be extended to ordinals, but for what I am going to ask is enough to have the definition for natural numbers. Let´s start with the first definition. Suppose $X$ is a compact topological space. First we will define the Cantor-Bendixson Rank of a point $a\in X$ as the largest natural number $n$ such that $a\in X^{(n)}$ . We will write $\textrm{CBR}_X(a)=n$ . Yes, I know that this definition should take into account not only natural numbers but also ordinals, but for the moment we may assume that the Cantor-Bendixson Rank is always finite. If $A$ is a non-empty closed subset of $X$ , we will say that the Cantor-Bendixson Rank of $A$ is $n$ if $n$ is the largest natural number for which there is some $a\in A$ with $\textrm{CBR}_X(a)=n$ . So $\textrm{CBR}_X(A)=n$ if and only if $A\cap X^{(n)}\neq\emptyset$ and $A\cap X^{(n+1)}=\emptyset$ .

This makes sense, because $A$ is again compact.

First suppose that $x\in \emptyset$ then the conclusion $x\in A\cap (X\setminus A)$ is vacuously true. Now suppose that $x \in A\cap (X\setminus A)$ .
