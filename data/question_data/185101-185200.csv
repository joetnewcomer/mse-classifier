33,Range of $f(x)=x \sqrt{1-x^2}$,Range of,f(x)=x \sqrt{1-x^2},"I have to find the range of $f(x)=x\sqrt{1-x^2}$ on the interval $[-1,1]$ . I have done so by setting $x=\sin\theta$ and thus finding it to be $[-0.5,0.5]$ . Let $x=\sinθ$ . Then, for $x\in[-1,1]$ we get that $θ \in [-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]$ . Thus, $f(x)$ becomes: $f(\theta)=\sin\theta \sqrt{1-(\sin\theta)^2}= \sin\theta |\cos\theta|$ . Since for $\theta \in [-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]$ we have that $cos\theta \geq 0$ : $f(θ)=\sinθ\cosθ=\frac{1}{2}\sin2θ$ . Which has maximum value $\frac{1}{2}$ when $\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}$ and minimum value $-\frac{1}{2}$ when $\theta = -\frac{π}{4}$ . When $\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}$ we have $x=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ and when $\theta = -\frac{\pi}{4}$ we have $x=-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ , which are the maximum and minimum positions respectively. So, $f(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})=\frac{1}{2}$ and $f(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})=-\frac{1}{2}$ . Thus the range of $f(x)$ is $[-\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}]$ . I know that it can be found with derivatives as well.

Mathematically: $$  |(A.B - \mu(A,B))| =  |(A+B - \mu(A,B))| $$ It is almost true for all positive numbers(some weird problem arises if the lower bound gets under 0) My First question is, why do they behave this way? Is this connected to De Morgan's theorem? I tried to see if there is a relation between the distance that those operations have from the actual number(A and B) and the distance of A and B.

This is what I have so far, but I'm not sure if it's the correct way to go about it. There are $3$ elements in set $C$ . We can pick two elements of set $B$ in $     \begin{pmatrix}     6 \\    2 \\     \end{pmatrix} $ ways.
