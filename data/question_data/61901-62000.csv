0,Leapfrogs puzzle -- Least number of moves needed to interchange the pegs,Leapfrogs puzzle -- Least number of moves needed to interchange the pegs,,"This is a question from the book ""Thinking Mathematically"" by Burton and Mason. Question: Ten pegs of two colors are laid out in a line of 11 holes as shown below. I want to interchange the black and white pegs, but I am only allowed to move pegs into an adjacent empty hole or to jump over one peg into an empty hole. Find the minimum number of moves necessary to make the change and generalize it to a case where there are $2n+1$ holes. Related thread: There's an existing thread here that already explains as to why it takes $n^2+2n$ moves to make the change which is something I easily figure out on my own. Please note that in that thread, a peg can move over another peg only if it is of the opposite color whereas the problem in the book does not stipulate that condition. I made the same assumption to arrive at the answer. The part that I'm stuck with is to show that there can't be any other strategy where it takes less than $n^2+2n$ moves to make the change. Assume for instance that I represent a black peg by 'B', a white peg by 'W', and the hole by 'H'. I assumed that the number of moves involves interchanging 'B' and 'H', and then moving the pegs in only one direction towards the destination. However, how can I show, that it is never possible to have a pattern like 'BBH' changing to a 'HBB' so that the black peg moves by two holes towards its destination? This way, it can further reduce the number of steps needed. My hunch is that with a pattern like 'HBB', any 'W' stuck to the right of the black pegs will remain there unless the black peg is made to move left, which effectively nullifies the advantage of having moved two steps to the right. However, this explanation is very loose. What if there are no white pegs to the left of the black peg in the 'HBB' part of the board? More importantly, how can I make it mathematically rigorous that there should never be a pattern like 'HBB' or 'WWH' during the process of transformation assuming the 'B's and 'H's need to be moved further to reach the goal? My failed approaches and current thought process: Such problems, from my past experience, have a slick solution where some invariant or a monovariant is used to prove the optimality of the algorithm. I tried many but I simply could not go anywhere with it. Another strategy is the same as that used in the Tower of Hanoi solution, which is an inductive argument, where you show that there's is an algorithm to make the optimal transformation in the $2n+1$ case, by using the optimal transformation in the $2n-1$ case, and there is no way around it. This seems possible as I was able to prove the number of moves needed to make the transformation is $n^2+2n$ using this strategy. However, it would be simply fantastic to figure out as to why we can never get a pattern like 'HBB' or 'WWH' assuming that both the pegs need to be further moved in order to reach the final goal. I would greatly appreciate it if you can provide the argument for me.","This is a question from the book ""Thinking Mathematically"" by Burton and Mason.

My hypothesis is that if there exists $x_i \ge N/2$, then $A \ge \frac{x_i^4 + (N-x_i)^4}{(x_i^2 + (N-x_i)^2)^2}$ (which I've verified experimentally for N up to 40).

(3)A vertex $v \in V$ is a $n$ -dimensional vector belonging to $(\{0\} \cup [m])^n$ whose $n-1$ coordinates are $0$ and one coordinate is non-zero. For example $[1, 0, 0]$ is a vertex while $[1, 1, 0]$ is not. There are $mn$ vertices. (4)A state $s \in (\{0\} \cup [m])^n$ is a set of vertices: $\{s_i \neq 0|[0, 0, \dots, \underbrace{s_i}_{i\text{-th}\,coordinate}, 0, 0, \dots, 0] \in V\}$ . There are $(m+1)^n$ states in total. The edges connect vertices in $V$ . We say a state $s$ is a deadlock iff one of the following two conditions: (1) $\exists x, y \in s$ such that $xy \in E$ . (Explicit law) (2) $\forall i \in [m]$ , $s + e_i$ is a deadlock. (Recursive law) I want to find an efficient algorithm which is polynomial w.r.t $|E|$ to determine whether a state $s$ is a deadlock, or prove this problem is $NP$ or $NP$ -hard. $\textbf{II. Background and Examples}$ I know this problem looks weird but it has a very practical background. Consider $n$ vehicles moving along $n$ distinct paths whose lengths are $m$ . Each vehicle is a vertex and a set of vehicles is a state. For each time we can ask one vehicle to move one step. However, due to geometric constraints, e.g., narrow roads, vertices might pairwise conflict, so there are deadlocks. To be convenient, I define the $\text{Next}(s)$ operator: It adds the non-zero coordinates of $s$ by $1$ without changing the $0$ coordinates, for example $\text{Next}([5, 2, 0]) = [6, 3, 0]$ . For the first example, $\{a, b, c\}$ forms a deadlock. $ab, bc, ca$ are not edges and $\{a, b, d, e\}, \{b, c, d, e\}, \{a, c, d, f\}$ do not form perfect matchings. However: (1)If we move $a$ to $d$ and get $\{d, b, c\}$ , ${d, b, g, e}$ forms a perfect matching $\{de, bg\}$ so neither of $d$ and $b$ could move (No.1 explicit law). (2)If we move $b$ to $e$ to get $\{a, e, c\}$ , $a$ could not move to $d$ because $de$ is an edge (No.1 explicit law). $c$ could not move to $f$ since $af$ is an edge (No.1 explicit law). $e$ could not move to $h$ as $hc$ is an edge. (3)We could not move $c$ to $f$ as $af$ is an edge. Then $\{a, b, c\}$ is a deadlock because of the No.2 recursive law. For the second example $s = \{a, b, c\}$ and $\text{Next}(s) = \{d, e, f\}$ . The induced bipartite graph $G[s \cup \text{Next}(s)]$ has a perfect matching so none of $a, b, c$ could move. Please note that three vehicles move one by one. If they can move simultaneously, they can move to $\{d, e, f\}$ together without an annoying deadlock. For the third example, $\{a, b\}$ forms a deadlock. $\{a, b\}$ can only move simultaneously to $\{a_1, b_1\}, \{a_2, b_2\}, \{a_3, b_3\}$ , then neither of them could move, as $\{a_4, b_3, a_5, b_4\}$ and $\{a_3, b_4, a_4, b_5\}$ have perfect matchings.

Additionally, let $n_k$ be the number of vertices of degree $k$ and $f_k$ be the number of faces with $k$ edges. I have come across a simple lemma that would make a nice exercise. Has anyone seen this before? Lemma: Let $G$ be a planar graph with every vertex of degree at least 3 so that no triangles share an edge (equivalently, $G$ does not contain a diamond as a subgraph). Then $f_3 < 2f/3$ . Lemma: (Dual version) Let $G = (V,E)$ be a graph with $f_1=f_2=0$ such that no two degree 3 vertices are incident. Then $n_3 < 2n/3$ . Proof: Let $e_3$ be the number of edges contained in a triangle and $e'$ be the number of edges that are not. Since no edge is contained in two triangles, we see $e_3 + e' = e$ and $3f_3 = e_3$ . Since every vertex has degree at least three, $$ 2e = \sum_{v \in V} deg(v) = \sum_{k \geq 3} k \cdot n_k \geq 3 n_3 + 4(n-n_3). $$ Rearranging, we have $n_3 \geq 4n - 2e$ . Let $v$ be a vertex of degree $3$ . Since no edge is contained in two triangles, at least of the edges containing $v$ is not part of a triangle, so contributes to $e'$ . That edge may contain two vertices of degree $3$ , so we have $n_3 \leq 2e'$ . Combining these observations, we have $$ f_3 = \frac{e_3}{3} = \frac{e - e'}{3} \leq \frac{e - n_3/2}{3} \leq \frac{2e - 2n}{3} = \frac{2f-4}{3} < 2f/3 $$ where the final equality is Euler's formula.

But when both ""bags"" have repeated elements, I could not create a rule for describing how many different ways there were to pair the elements.

Define an action $P_k$ on a finite sequence $\{a_n\}_{n=1}^m (m>k)$ : choose $k$ consecutive terms (from the sequence), move them to the middle of two terms (or append them at the beginning or end) of the remaining sequence to form a new sequence $\{a_n'\}_{n=1}^m$ . For example, if we apply $P_3$ to the sequence $1,3,7,5,6$ , the result could be \begin{align*} 1,3,\color{red}{7,5,6}&\xrightarrow{P_3}1,\color{red}{7,5,6},3\\ 1,3,\color{red}{7,5,6}&\xrightarrow{P_3}\color{red}{7,5,6},1,3\\ 1,\color{blue}{3,7,5},6&\xrightarrow{P_3}1,6,\color{blue}{3,7,5}\\ 1,\color{blue}{3,7,5},6&\xrightarrow{P_3}\color{blue}{3,7,5},1,6\\ &\quad\vdots \end{align*} Question 1. Prove: any sequence formed by permutations of $1,2,3,4,5,6$ could be ""reduced"" to $1,2,3,4,5,6$ after applying $P_3$ for finite times. 2. Find all $k$ such that any sequence formed by permutations of $1,2,3,\dots,2k$ could be ""reduced"" to $1,2,3,\dots,2k$ after applying $P_k$ for finite times. For Qn 1 , let $\mathcal B=\{(1\ 2),(2\ 3),(3\ 4),(4\ 5),(5\ 6)\}$ , where all elements in $\mathcal B$ are cycle notation . For example, $(1\ 2)$ means $\color{red}{a_4,a_6},a_5,a_2,a_1,a_3\to\color{red}{a_6,a_4},a_5,a_2,a_1,a_3$ .

We could also get $(2\ 3)$ and $(3\ 4)$ with some effort. Since all $6!=720$ permutaions could be generated by the composition of elements in $\mathcal B$ (e.g. $(1\ 3)=(2\ 3)(1\ 2)(2\ 3)$ ), we finished the proof.

My ""progress"": (i) So far I've only been able to prove that the above tuples $(\delta_{n,m},D_{n,m})$ are indeed elements of $\mathfrak{g}$, and in the argumentation I've shown that $$[c_{l-1,r+1},X]= [Y,c_{l,r}].$$ Then my try goes on like: Let now $\sigma\in \mathfrak{g}$ be any (non trivial) element. We decompose the associated $D$ in its homogeneous components $D_{n,m}$ where $n$ indicates the number of $X$'s and ditto $m$ for $Y$. We do this because no cancellation can take place between terms in which these do not match, when evaluating the lie Bracket $[D,X]$, so we can work with each of these components separately. So let $D_{n,m}$ be a non zero homogeneous component of $D$. We claim that: $$D_{n,m}=\lambda \cdot c_{n,m} \quad \lambda \in \mathbb{C}.$$ Assume not, then, up to removing the homogeneous components, we have that there must be at least one missing homogeneous polynomial. We will show that this will lead to a contradiction to the existance of a $D_t$ of the desired form. Let $D_t:=\sum_{k\ge0}^N w_kt^k$, where $w_k$ is just some sum of words in $X$ and $Y$ as always, be a generic candidate. Do to the definition of the lie algebra, we ask ourselves which property must $D_t$ have to be able to satisfy the given equation: \begin{align*} [D_{n,m},X] & = [D_t,X+tY] = \left[\sum_{k=0}^N w_kt^k,X+tY\right]\\ & = [w_0,X]+\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}([w_{k+1},X]+[w_k,Y])t^{k+1}+[w_N,Y]t^{N+1}\end{align*} Since the field we are working on is infinite, and since the term on the left hand side is of degree 0 and has trivial centralizer, we see that two straightforward conditions which must be satisfied are: $$w_0-D_{n,m}=\sum_{k=0}^M \alpha_k X^k \ \text{and} \ w_N=\sum_{k=0}^M \beta_k Y^k \quad \alpha_k,\beta_l \in \mathbb{C} $$ $$[\dots]$$ EDIT [09.06] I've solved this part. One just needed to start from the $w_N=\sum_{k=0}^M \beta_k Y^k$ term, reduce to the case $\beta_k=\delta_{ik}$ and then using the previous result we get the claim. $(ii)$ My try: Since we have found a basis and because of the Leibniz property our task reduces to show the following: $$\forall k,m\ge 0; n,l\ge 1 : \quad [\delta_{n,m},\delta_{k,l}]\equiv 0 \iff [\delta_{n,m},\delta_{k,l}](X)=0 \text{ and } [\delta_{n,m},\delta_{k,l}](Y)=0$$ Clearly the second equality is a direct consequence of the definition of the $\delta$'s. For the first equality one needs to work a little bit more: $$[\delta_{n,m},\delta_{k,l}](X) = [\text{ some manipulations... }]= [X,\delta_{k,l}(c_{n,m})-\delta_{n,m}(c_{k,l})-[c_{n,m},c_{k,l}]]$$ I've now checked computationally that the the expression in the right hand side of the Bracket is zero for a few values of $(k,l),(n,m)$; but how to prove this in general?

My ""progress"": (i) So far I've only been able to prove that the above tuples $(\delta_{n,m},D_{n,m})$ are indeed elements of $\mathfrak{g}$, and in the argumentation I've shown that $$[c_{l-1,r+1},X]= [Y,c_{l,r}].$$ Then my try goes on like: Let now $\sigma\in \mathfrak{g}$ be any (non trivial) element. We decompose the associated $D$ in its homogeneous components $D_{n,m}$ where $n$ indicates the number of $X$'s and ditto $m$ for $Y$. We do this because no cancellation can take place between terms in which these do not match, when evaluating the lie Bracket $[D,X]$, so we can work with each of these components separately. So let $D_{n,m}$ be a non zero homogeneous component of $D$. We claim that: $$D_{n,m}=\lambda \cdot c_{n,m} \quad \lambda \in \mathbb{C}.$$ Assume not, then, up to removing the homogeneous components, we have that there must be at least one missing homogeneous polynomial. We will show that this will lead to a contradiction to the existance of a $D_t$ of the desired form. Let $D_t:=\sum_{k\ge0}^N w_kt^k$, where $w_k$ is just some sum of words in $X$ and $Y$ as always, be a generic candidate. Do to the definition of the lie algebra, we ask ourselves which property must $D_t$ have to be able to satisfy the given equation: \begin{align*} [D_{n,m},X] & = [D_t,X+tY] = \left[\sum_{k=0}^N w_kt^k,X+tY\right]\\ & = [w_0,X]+\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}([w_{k+1},X]+[w_k,Y])t^{k+1}+[w_N,Y]t^{N+1}\end{align*} Since the field we are working on is infinite, and since the term on the left hand side is of degree 0 and has trivial centralizer, we see that two straightforward conditions which must be satisfied are: $$w_0-D_{n,m}=\sum_{k=0}^M \alpha_k X^k \ \text{and} \ w_N=\sum_{k=0}^M \beta_k Y^k \quad \alpha_k,\beta_l \in \mathbb{C} $$ $$[\dots]$$ EDIT [09.06] I've solved this part. One just needed to start from the $w_N=\sum_{k=0}^M \beta_k Y^k$ term, reduce to the case $\beta_k=\delta_{ik}$ and then using the previous result we get the claim. $(ii)$ My try: Since we have found a basis and because of the Leibniz property our task reduces to show the following: $$\forall k,m\ge 0; n,l\ge 1 : \quad [\delta_{n,m},\delta_{k,l}]\equiv 0 \iff [\delta_{n,m},\delta_{k,l}](X)=0 \text{ and } [\delta_{n,m},\delta_{k,l}](Y)=0$$ Clearly the second equality is a direct consequence of the definition of the $\delta$'s. For the first equality one needs to work a little bit more: $$[\delta_{n,m},\delta_{k,l}](X) = [\text{ some manipulations... }]= [X,\delta_{k,l}(c_{n,m})-\delta_{n,m}(c_{k,l})-[c_{n,m},c_{k,l}]]$$ I've now checked computationally that the the expression in the right hand side of the Bracket is zero for a few values of $(k,l),(n,m)$; but how to prove this in general?

It means there are a total of 16 places: $$*_1*_2*_3*_4\quad A\quad*_5*_6*_7*_8\quad I\quad*_9*_{10}*_{11}*_{12}\quad O \quad *_{13}*_{14}*_{15}*_{16}$$    Out of these 16 places remaining, the letter can appear in any of the 4 places, giving total $^{16}P_4 = 43680$ possible arrangements. But the given answer is just 840 with following explanation: All the 7 letters of the word RAINBOW can be arranged in 7! ways and 3 particular letters (A,I,O) can be arranged in 3! ways. But the given condition is satisfied by only 1 out of 6 ways. Hence required number of arrangements    $$=\frac{7!}{3!} = 840$$ So what's wrong with my logic? I must be counting certain arrangements multiple times or my logic must be at fault in large. But what's that exactly?",,"['combinatorics', 'permutations']"

97,Why does the combination formula divide counts by two?,Why does the combination formula divide counts by two?,,"This thing is confusing me for a long time and hence  I am asking it here. We have a given set of numbers $$ X = \{1,2,3,4,5\} $$ and we want to form a $4$- digit number of the form $aaac$(this is just symbolic; I want all the arrangements of this form for e.g. $aaca$ etc). (I know that such questions' answers do exist on MSE, but my doubt/ confusion is pertinent to something extraneous to such questions.) To make such a number the first approach that we can induce in our solution is that of using simple combination technique and choose two numbers out of the set of $5$ numbers. This can be done in the following way: $$\binom{5}{2} \cdot \frac {4!}{3!}=40  $$ That seems fine as far as the combination formula is confirmed.  Let us now take a naive approach and pretend as if we don't know the combination formula. Here we use the gap method: Let us make one of our configuration as: $$\fbox{a} \fbox{a} \fbox{a}  \fbox{c}$$ Here $a$ can be chosed in $5$ ways and $c$ can be chosen in $4$ ways Total ways to make $aaac$ configuration $=5 \cdot 1\cdot 1\cdot 4 = 20$ ways Every such configuration now needs to be permuted since we want $aaca$ etc. also. To permute such a configuration, we can write: $$ \frac {4!}{3!} \cdot 20 = 80$$ which is exactly double that of the answer obtained from the combination formula (which makes be believe that either I have double counted things or I have snubbed some of the arrangements). Now let us try to think about some cases manually: Case $1$: When $a=1$ The cases are: $$\{1112\}, \{1121\},\{1211\},\{2111\},\{1113\},\{1131\},\{1311\},\{3111\},\{1114\},\{1141\},\{1411\},\{4111\},\{1115\},\{1151\},\{1511\},\{5111\}$$ Thus there are $16$ configurations regarding $1$ only which means that for all the whole set, there are $16 \cdot 5 =80$ configurations. This proves that the problem is with my usage of the combination formula. Can anybody tell me how my usage of combination formula comes out to be fallacious?","This thing is confusing me for a long time and hence  I am asking it here.

I can move from one vertex to only any other adjacent vertex through the edge of the cube. In how many ways can I start and end at the same vertex?
