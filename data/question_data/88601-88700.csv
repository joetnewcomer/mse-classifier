To do this, I used the singular value decomposition. However, I was wondering if there's a different proof that relies on more general properties of Hilbert spaces (under the assumption that $u$ exists in the more general setting where $\langle \cdot, \cdot\rangle$ and $\|\cdot\|$ are the Hilbert space inner product and norm). My own short proof is below: We first handle the case where $A = \operatorname{diag}(d_1, \ldots, d_n)$ for some $d_1\geq \cdots\geq d_n\geq 0$ . Then, $u = e_1$ , so $$\lvert \langle u, v\rangle\rvert^2\|A\|^2 = d_1^2v_1^2\leq \sum_{i=1}^n d_i^2v_i^2 = \|Av\|^2$$ Now, we consider general $A$ , which has a singular value decomposition $A = U\Sigma V^{\mathrm{T}}$ for $U$ and $V$ orthogonal and $\Sigma$ diagonal in the above form. First, we recall that multiplication by orthogonal matrices preserves the dot product, i.e. $\langle Qx, Qy\rangle = \langle x, y\rangle$ for orthogonal $Q$ .

Furthermore, as $\|Au\|^2 = \|\Sigma V^{\mathrm{T}}u\|^2$ and $\|V^{\mathrm{T}}u\|^2 = \|u\|^2 = 1$ , we have that $\|A\| = \|\Sigma\|$ and that $y = V^{\mathrm{T}}u$ satisfies $\|\Sigma y\| = \|\Sigma\|$ . Combining our earlier results, $$\|Av\|^2 = \|\Sigma V^{\mathrm{T}}v\|^2\geq \lvert\langle y, V^{\mathrm{T}}v\rangle\rvert^2\|\Sigma\|^2 = \lvert\langle V^{\mathrm{T}}u, V^{\mathrm{T}}v\rangle\rvert^2\|A\|^2 = \lvert\langle u, v\rangle\rvert^2\|A\|^2$$","I've shown that for a matrix and an arbitrary , we have the inequality where is the -norm and satisfies and (the operator norm of corresponding to the vector -norm).

18,Understanding compact extensions and almost-periodic functions,Understanding compact extensions and almost-periodic functions,,"This question comes from my attempt to understand theorem $7.21$ in E-W . This concerns the dichotomy between relatively weak-mixing extensions and compact extensions. I cannot understand the proof as I do not understand these concepts. I will sketch my understanding of the proof until the part I'm certain I don't understand. All systems are taken to be ergodic, invertible, and Borel. Definition 1: An extension $\psi:(X,\mathscr{B},\mu,T) \to (Y,\mathscr{A},\nu,S)$ is said to be relatively weak-mixing if the system $(X\times X,\mathscr{B}\otimes\mathscr{B},\bar{\mu},T\times T)$ is ergodic. Here $\bar{\mu}$ is the relatively independent join over $Y$ (See E-W definition $6.15$ ). Definition 2: Again, let $\psi:(X,\mathscr{B},\mu,T) \to (Y,\mathscr{A},\nu,S)$ be an extension. Let $\mu^{\psi^{-1}\mathscr{A}}_x$ be the conditional measures on $(X,\mathscr{B})$ . A function $f\in L^2(X,\mathscr{B},\mu)$ is almost-periodic $(AP)$ with respect to $Y$ if given $\varepsilon>0$ , there exist $g_1,\dots,g_r\in L^2(X,\mathscr{B},\mu)$ such that $\forall n \in \mathbb{Z}$ , $\nu$ -a.e $y$ , $$\min_{i}\|U_T^nf-g_i\|_{L^2(\mu_y^{\mathscr{A}})}<\varepsilon.$$ Here $U_Tf:=f\circ T$ and $\mu_y^{\mathscr{A}}$ are the measures on $(X,\mathscr{B})$ obtained by completing the conditional measure diagram: $\require{AMScd}$ \begin{CD} X @>\mu^{\psi^{-1}\mathscr{A}}_.>> M\left(\bar{X}\right)\\ @V{\psi}VV  @| \\ Y @>\mu^{\mathscr{A}}_.>> M\left(\bar{X}\right) \end{CD} Definition 3: The extension $\psi:(X,\mathscr{B},\mu,T) \to (Y,\mathscr{A},\nu,S)$ is said to be a compact extension if the set of $AP$ (with respect to $Y$ ) functions in $L^2(X,\mathscr{B},\mu)$ is dense. Theorem 7.21: If the extension $\psi:(X,\mathscr{B},\mu,T) \to (Y,\mathscr{A},\nu,S)$ is not relatively weak-mixing, there exists a non-trivial intermediate factor $X\to X^* \to Y$ with the property that $X^* \to Y$ is a compact extension. Sketch of proof: (For details see E-W page $200$ onwards) By the hypothesis, there exists a non-constant $H \in \mathscr{L}^\infty(X\times X,\bar{\mu})$ invariant under $T\times T$ ( $\mathscr{L}$ denotes the fact that $H$ is bounded and not just essentially-bounded). For $\phi \in L^2(X,\mathscr{B},\mu)$ , define $$H*\phi(x) = \int H(x,x')\phi(x')d\mu^{\psi^{-1}\mathscr{A}}_x(x').$$ One can show this formula defines a bounded operator $L^2(X,\mathscr{B},\mu)\to L^2(X,\mathscr{B},\mu).$ And, a priori, this formula defines a compact operator $L^2(X,\mathscr{B},\mu^{\psi^{-1}\mathscr{A}}_x) \to L^2(X,\mathscr{B},\mu^{\psi^{-1}\mathscr{A}}_x)$ . Using this and the additional fact that $U_T(H*\phi)=H*(U_T\phi)$ , one shows that $\lbrace H*\phi : \phi \in \mathscr{L}^{\infty}(X,\mathscr{B},\mu)\rbrace$ is an $AP$ (wrt. $Y$ ) family in $L^{\infty}(X,\mathscr{B},\mu)$ . Moreover, one can show that this family contains functions which are not $\psi^{-1}\mathscr{A}$ -measureable. Then if we define $\mathscr{F}=\lbrace f\in L^{\infty}(X,\mathscr{B},\mu): f \text{ is } AP \text{ wrt. } Y\rbrace $ and $\mathscr{B}^*$ to be the smallest $\sigma$ -algebra making the functions in $\mathscr{F}$ measurable, one can show that $\mathscr{F} \subset L^2(X,\mathscr{B}^*,\mu)$ is dense. Here's the part I don't understand: It is then claimed that the $T$ -invariant $\sigma$ -algebra $\mathscr{B}^* (\subset \mathscr{B}$ ) gives rise to the intermediate, non-trivial, compact extension. I assume that this is done by completing the following system of extensions from $M\left(\bar{X}\right)$ to $Y$ : \begin{CD} X @>\psi>> Y\\ @V\mu^{\mathscr{B}^*}_.VV   \\  M\left(\bar{X}\right)  \end{CD} The $T$ -invariance of $\mathscr{B}^*$ shows that $\mu^{\mathscr{B}^*}_.$ gives an extension. And I guess the density of $\mathscr{F}$ will be used to show $M\left( \bar{X}\right)$ is a compact extension of $Y$ . Question: To complete the above diagram, don't we need to show that $\psi^{-1}\mathscr{A}\subset \mathscr{B}^*$ ? Is this obvious? It is not explicitly addressed in the text. Thanks for reading, all help is appreciated. Edit: As John Griesmer points out, $\psi^{-1}\mathscr{A}\subset\mathscr{B}^*$ would follow if one could show every characteristic function $1_{\psi^{-1}A}$ on $X$ was AP with respect to Y. I don't quite see why such a statement should be true though. Take the function $1_{A}\circ\psi$ . I want to find functions $g_i\in L^2(X,\mathscr{B},\mu)$ and estimate $$\int|1_{A}(\psi(T^nx))-g_i(x)|^2d\mu_{x'}^{\psi^{-1}\mathscr{A}}(x) = \int|1_{A}(S^n(\psi x))-g_i(x)|^2d\mu_{x'}^{\psi^{-1}\mathscr{A}}(x)$$ as $x'$ varies in $X$ . Now if the $g_i$ 's happened to be functions on $Y$ , I could rewrite the last integral as $$\int|1_{A}(S^ny)-g_i(y)|^2d\nu_{\psi x'}^{\mathscr{A}}(x) = E\left(|U_S^n1_A-g_i|^2:\mathscr{A},\nu\right)(\psi(x')) = |U^n_S1_A - g_i|^2(\psi(x'))$$ by the properties of the conditional expectation operator. So I guess, I'm left trying to play around with the equation $$\min_i|U_s^n1_A(y) - g_i(y)|^2 < \varepsilon, $$ and hope that it holds for almost every $y$ and for all $n$ . Am I on the right track? what would be sensible choices for the $g_i$ ?

19,Inverting the Laplacian,Inverting the Laplacian,,"I've had a hard time looking for literature on this, so here's my question: We take a look at the Laplacian $-\Delta$ as an unbounded operator on $\mathrm{L}^2(\mathbb{R}^3)$ . We know that $-\Delta$ is unitary equivalent to the multiplication operator with $|p|^2$ in Fourier space, so $-\Delta=\mathcal{F}^{-1} |p|^2 \mathcal{F}$ . So one could now use functional calculus and define an inverse Laplacian by setting $(-\Delta)^{-1}=\mathcal{F}^{-1} (1/|p|^2 )\mathcal{F}$ , which will also be unbounded of course. It is also known from theory of PDEs that one can invert the Laplacian on Schwartz functions using the Green's function $1/4\pi |x|$ , which is derived as a distributional Fourier transform of $1/|p|^2$ . So define $G$ on $\mathrm{L}^2(\mathbb{R}^3)$ by convolution with $1/4\pi |x|$ : $$(G\phi)(x)=\int \frac{\phi(y)}{4\pi |x-y|} dy$$ $G$ is also unbounded and coincides at least for the Schwartz functions with the above defined inverse Laplacian, $G\phi=(-\Delta)^{-1}\phi$ for all $\phi \in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^3)$ . Now my question is: Are both operators the same? Does $G=(-\Delta)^{-1}$ hold, i. e. is $D(G)=D((-\Delta)^{-1})$ and $G\phi=(-\Delta)^{-1}\phi$ for all $\phi \in D(G)=D((-\Delta)^{-1})$ ? My guess is that $\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^3)$ is a core of $(-\Delta)^{-1}$ , and as $(-\Delta)^{-1}|_{\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^3)}=G|_{\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^3)}$ equality should follow by closing the restrictions.

The short-hand notation is $T(\epsilon) \equiv T_{\epsilon}$ for any $\epsilon \in I$ . Suppose further that $T$ is continuous (possibly Frechet differentiable?) and that $T_0$ is simply given by $$T_0v = cv,\quad(1)$$ where $c > 0$ . Final assumptions are that for any $\epsilon \in I$ , $T_{\epsilon}$ is self-adjoint and is an isomorphism  and for $\epsilon > 0$ it is not of the form given in (1). (Side note: I am looking at a specific example but I wanted to look at the problem more abstractly, perhaps some of the 'assumptions' either follow from the others or are not needed). I would like to be able to characterise the set of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $T_{\epsilon}$ and how they depend on the parameter $\epsilon$ . Trivially, the form of $T_0$ implies that $c$ is the sole eigenvalue of $T_0$ and its corresponding eigenspace is the whole of $V$ . It seems fairly natural that the eigenvalues will be continuous functions of $\epsilon$ since $T$ is a continuous function and so if $\lambda_\epsilon$ is an eigenvalue of $T_\epsilon$ with the corresponding eigenvector $v_{\epsilon}$ then $$ (\lambda - c)v_{\epsilon} = (T_{\epsilon}-T_0)v_{\epsilon} \implies |\lambda - c|\|v_{\epsilon}\| \leq \|(T_{\epsilon}-T_0)\|\|v_{\epsilon}\| \implies |\lambda - c| \leq C\epsilon, $$ with the first equality following from the fact that $v_{\epsilon}$ is also an eigenvector for $T_0$ . But what gives us the certainty that $T_{\epsilon}$ has any eigenvalues at all? How many eigenvalues can it have? Since it is self-adjoint and $V$ is separable, there can be at most countably many eigenvalues, so it is tempting to conjecture that the set of eigenvalues is $$(\lambda_1(\epsilon),\lambda_2(\epsilon),\dots)$$ with each entry being a continous function of $\epsilon$ with $\lambda_i(0) = c$ and possibly $\lambda_i(\epsilon) = \lambda_j(\epsilon)$ for some $i\neq j$ . A further conjecture would be that each $\lambda_i(\epsilon)$ can be associated with one eigenvector $v_i$ such that $(v_i,v_j) = 0$ and the closure of ${\rm span}(v_1,v_2,\dots)$ is the whole of $V$ . For that it feels like we should employ Spectral Theorem, so in particular perhaps establish that $ (T_{\epsilon} - T_0)$ is a compact operator? Is it? I do not quite see it. I will humbly appreciate any potential comments, I am quite confused here, in particular the notion of orthonormal basis for infinite-dimensional Hilbert space seems a bit elusive.

Show that for every function $f\geq 0$ in $L^p(X,d\mu)$ $$ T(f) = \int_X fh \; d\mu + \int_X fh \; d\lambda \quad \text{and} \quad T(f(1-h)) = \int_X fh \; d\mu. $$ Show that for every positive integer $k$ the function $\min(f/(1-h),k)$ belongs to $L^p(X,d\mu)$ and that $$ T(\min(f/(1-h),k)) = \int_X \min(f/(1-h),k) \; d\mu. $$ Take $g=h/(1-h)$ and conclude by making $k\to +\infty$.

65,Hahn Banach Theorem: Transfinite Induction,Hahn Banach Theorem: Transfinite Induction,,"In the 4th book of Stein and Shakarchi, the statement of the Hahn-Banach theorem is as follows: Suppose $V_0$ is a linear subspace of $V$ and $p$ is a real sub-linear function on $V$, and that we are given a linear functional $l_0$ on $V_0$ that satisfies $$l_0(v)\leq p(v) ~\forall ~v\in V_0$$   Then $l_0$ can be extended to a linear functional $l$ on $V$ that satisfies    $$l(v) \leq p(v)~ \forall ~ v \in V$$ The proof given is as follows: We have already proved that if $l_0$ can be extended to a subspace W, then it can also be extended to the subspace $W+ w$ for any vector $w$. We well order all the vectors in $V$ that do not belong to $V_0$, and denote this ordering by $<$. Among these vectors, we call a vector $v$ extendable if the linear functional $l_0$ has an extension of the kind desired to the subspace spanned by $V_0.v$ and all the vectors $<v$.

Does $$ \int_{[0,1]} \frac{1-x^{\lambda}}{1-x}\mu(dx)=0 \quad\forall \lambda>0 $$ imply $\mu\equiv 0$? (With $\frac{1-x^{\lambda}}{1-x}:=\lambda$ for $x=1$.) EDIT: After some thought, I realized that, by the Hahn-Banach theorem, I may equivalently ask whether the span of $\{\frac{1-x^{\lambda}}{1-x}: \lambda>0\}$ is dense in $(C([0,1]),\|\cdot\|_{\sup})$, which shows that my attempt below is somehow the only way to go. Attempt : I can show the claim under the additional assumption that $1\not\in\text{supp}\, \mu$. Indeed, I may then define  $$ \tilde{\mu}(dx):=\frac{\mu(dx)}{1-x} $$ and proceed in two steps, using that $$ \int_{[0,1]}(1-x^{\lambda})\tilde{\mu}(dx)=0\quad\forall \lambda>0\quad (1) $$ 1) Letting $\lambda\to\infty$, we get uniform convergence $1-x^{\lambda}\to 1$ on $\text{supp}\, \tilde{\mu}$, thus $\int \tilde{\mu}=0$. 2) Thus, Equation (1) simplifies to  $$ \int_{[0,1]}x^\lambda\tilde{\mu}(dx)=0\quad\forall\lambda>0, $$  from which we conclude $\tilde{\mu}\equiv 0$ by the Weierstrass theorem and the fact that the signed measures on $[0,1]$ are the dual space of the continuous functions.

75,How to relate the spectrum of a self-adjoint unbounded operator to the spectrum of a compact solution operator,How to relate the spectrum of a self-adjoint unbounded operator to the spectrum of a compact solution operator,,"Apologies if this is a trivial question. I'm having some trouble getting this straight in my head and would appreciate either an explanation or a pointer to a good reference. If this looks too long, here's a tl;dr Say I have a densely defined, bounded below, symmetric operator $T$ defined in a Hilbert space $H$. After shifting by some $\sigma$ one can show there exists a compact solution operator $K$. Why does the spectrum of $T$ coincide with (a shift of) the spectrum of $K$? Setup Let $H$ be a Hilbert space with inner product $(\cdot,\cdot)$. Let $T$ be a densely defined symmetric operator bounded below by some constant $c$, with $D = \operatorname{dom}(T)$. Define the form $\mathfrak{t}$ on $D\times D$ by $\mathfrak{t}(u,v) = (Tu,v)$. By symmetry $\mathfrak{t}$ is sesquilinear. Because $T$ is bounded below, if we choose $\sigma > \max\{1,-c\}$, the form defined on $D\times D$ by  $$ \mathfrak{t}_\sigma(u,v) = \mathfrak{t}(u,v) + \sigma\cdot(u,v) $$ is a positive definite Hermitian inner product on $D$. Define by $V$ the completion of $D$ with respect to $\mathfrak{t}_\sigma$. As $\mathfrak{t}_\sigma$ majorizes the norm on $H$ the injection $D\hookrightarrow H$ extends to a bounded embedding $\iota : V\hookrightarrow H$. Now assume that $V$ compactly embeds in $H$. (Here, if $T$ is not self-adjoint, take the Friedrichs extension.) Define an eigenvalue of $\mathfrak{t}$ to be any $\mu\in\mathbb{C}$ such that there exists some $u\in V$ so for all $v\in V$ we have $\mathfrak{t}(u,v) = \mu(u,v)$. I do not assume eigenvectors of $\mathfrak{t}$ are elements of $D$. By Riesz there exists a solution operator $S_\sigma: V^*\to V$. There is a bounded map $P:H\to V^*$ given by $u\mapsto (v\mapsto (u,v))$. (This is bounded by an application of Cauchy-Schwarz.) Composing these with the compact injection $\iota$ gives a compact map $K = S_\sigma P\iota:V\to V$. Note that $K$ has the property that for any $u\in V$,  $$ \mathfrak{t}_\sigma(Ku, v) = (u,v). $$ By the spectral theorem for compact operators, the spectrum of $K$ is discrete accumulating only at zero, and all nonzero elements of the spectrum are eigenvalues of finite multiplicity. Suppose $u$ is an eigenvalue of $K$ with eigenvector $\mu$. Then for arbitrary $v\in V$, \begin{align*} \mathfrak{t}(u,v) &= \mathfrak{t}_\sigma(u,v) - \sigma(u,v) \\   &= \frac{1}{\mu}\mathfrak{t}_\sigma(Ku, v) - \sigma(u,v) \\   &= \bigg(\frac{1}{\mu}-\sigma\bigg)(u,v) \end{align*} and so we have that $\frac{1 - \mu\sigma}{\mu}$ is an eigenvalue of $\mathfrak{t}$ with eigenvector $u$. Confusion Does it follow that   $$ \mbox{spectrum of } T = \bigg\{ \frac{1-\mu\sigma}{\mu}\ \bigg|\ \mu\in\mbox{spectrum of }K - \{0\} \bigg\}? $$ Thoughts I've been worrying at this for a couple of days and trying to prove something like the following: If $\lambda$ is in the resolvent set of $T$, then $\frac{1}{\sigma+\lambda}$ is in the resolvent set of $K$. This would immediately imply what I want modulo showing that that eigenvalues of $\mathfrak{t}$ are contained in the spectrum of $T$. (This is not a concern, see the note below.) Some algebra and head-scratching later, nothing has panned out -- it looks promising, but I haven't found the zinger yet. Maybe more to the point, I don't have enough intuition for where the algebra ought to go. I've started by assuming that $u$ is a $\mu$-eigenvector of $K$ in $H$ (after extending showing $K$ is symmetric and extending $K$ to a map $H\to H$ by density of $V$ and compactness), assuming that $\frac{1}{\lambda + \sigma}$ is in the resolvent set of $T$, and showing that we cannot have $\mu = \frac{1}{\lambda + \sigma}$, but this approach doesn't seem to rely on the assumption that the domain of $(T-\lambda)^{-1}$  is all of $H$, nor that it is bounded. I'm aware that this closely follows standard reference materials (Gilbarg-Trudinger Ch 8, Evans ch 6.5). In fact in Evans 6.5, at the end of the proof of Theorem 1, Evans writes, ""But observe as well that for $\eta\neq 0$, we have $Sw = \eta w$ if and only if $Lw = \lambda w$ for $\lambda = \frac{1}{\eta}$."" You might interpret this question as, ""why does the 'only if' follow?"" There are at least two other approaches I'm aware of to showing the spectrum of $T$ is discrete. One uses the Rayleigh quotient, shows there exists a lowest eigenvalue, and proceeds by induction to exhaust $H$ with orthonormal eigenspaces (e.g. Gilbarg-Trudinger, last section of ch 8). The other uses the theory of spectral measures (e.g. ch 13 of Green Rudin). I'd prefer to avoid those approaches if possible because I'd like to understand all three in as much detail as possible, in order to more thoroughly understand how they relate to each other. (My intuition is that the exhaustion proof is related to how this proof would go if one unpacked the spectral theorem for compact operators, while the theory of spectral measures is ""not homotopic,"" as it were, to this proof, but that's not yet clear to me.) Anyway, I'm missing a piece of the puzzle here and I'm not sure where the missing piece fits to look more closely for it. Notes In the context of PDEs I'm happy to assume the facts bolded in the setup: $V$ is related to a Sobolev space $W^{1,1}$ so Rellich-Kondrachov comes into play, and elliptic regularity gives that the eigenvectors of $\mathfrak{t}$ are in fact eigenvectors of $T$.

78,Fréchet derivative of a functional.,Fréchet derivative of a functional.,,"I need to show that the functional defined by $$\int_{0}^{1} \cos(u(x)) dx$$ is not Fréchet differentiable in $L^2((0,1))$. A hint is that the requested property of the remainder for a Fréchet derivative is already violated for step functions. I was looking for similar questions and see that under a Taylor expansion, one can introduce a first order aproximation of $\cos(\cdot)$ and then take the second order residual as a step function. For example, If we consider the functional defined as $$y(x)=\sin(u(x)), \quad u \in L^2(\Omega)$$ then we have $$\sin(0+h(x))=\sin(0)+\cos(0)h(x)+\int_{0}^{1}[\cos(0+sh(x))-\cos(0)]ds$$ for $h\in L^p(0,1)$ given and $s \in (0,1)$. As far I know, that expansion is a  Taylor expansion in the integral form, but I dont see why we can put those terms in the integral, because I know that a expansion of this kind wold be of the form: $$f(a+x)=f(a)+f'(a)x+\int_{0}^{1}\frac{f''(a+sx)}{2}x^2ds.$$ Is the last expression wrong? And, would it be usefull a Taylor expansion to show the non-differentiability of the first functional given? A important fact is that in the $\sin(\cdot)$ example, taking $h$ as the step function $$h(x)=\begin{cases}1,&x\in [0,\epsilon]\\0,&x\in[\epsilon,1]\end{cases}$$ it's possible to show the non-differentiability of $\sin(\cdot)$ as a funtional, and I was thinking in a similar argument.

We introduce a partial order into $A$ as $\alpha\leq \alpha'$ meaning that each set in $\alpha$ is a union of some sets in $\alpha'$, this makes $A$ a directed set. Let $E_\alpha:L\to L$ be the conditional expectation operator with respect to the semi-partition $\alpha$, mapping functions to their average values on the sets of $\alpha$ and to zero outside of these sets. We have that for fixed $f\in L$, the net $\{E_\alpha f\}$ converges to $f$. Let $L_\alpha$ be the range of $E_\alpha$ (this is a finite dimensional $L^p$-space).

Furhtermore it is well-known that the above inner product can be extended to $H_1\otimes H_2$, such that it satisfies $$ \langle \iota(\phi\otimes \psi), \iota(\gamma\otimes \beta) \rangle_{H_1\otimes H_2} = \langle\phi_1,\gamma\rangle_1 \langle \psi,\beta\rangle_2 $$ for any $\phi,\gamma\in H_1$ and $\psi,\beta\in H_2$, where $\iota$ is the linear isometric embedding into the completion. Question : Is this a valid construction of the tensor product of two Hilbert spaces with different fields? I could not find any mistake, but the ideas are taken from some notes that considers two real Hilbert spaces. Also every source of the tensor product of Hilbert spaces that I have encountered considers either two real or two complex Hilbert spaces, which is why I'm worried I have made a mistake.

98,Equivalence to essentially self-adjoint,Equivalence to essentially self-adjoint,,"In a book I have found a statement (without proof): Let $A$ be a symmetric operator on a Hilbert space $\mathcal H$ , the following are equivalent: $A$ is essentially self-adjoint $\nu(i)=\nu(-i)=0$ The ranges of $A-i \mathbb{1}$ and $A+i\mathbb 1$ are dense in $\mathcal H$ Here $\nu(\lambda)$ is defined as the dimension of the $\ker(A^*-\lambda \mathbb 1)$ . I don't really know where to begin with the proof. For 2. and 3. is it necessary to have both parts of the statement or are they already equivalent to each other? How can the statement be proven? I think at this point I would appreciate hints more than the direct proof.","In a book I have found a statement (without proof): Let be a symmetric operator on a Hilbert space , the following are equivalent: is essentially self-adjoint The ranges of and are dense in Here is defined as the dimension of the .

99,How does one derive Radial Basis Function (RBF) Networks as the smoothest interpolation of points?,How does one derive Radial Basis Function (RBF) Networks as the smoothest interpolation of points?,,"I was reading/watching CalTech's ML course and it said that one could derive the RBF Gaussian kernel from the solution to smoothest interpolation that minimizes squared loss. i.e. one can derive the predictor/interpolator: $$ f(x) = \sum^{K}_{k=1} c_k \exp( -\beta_k \| x - w_k \|^2 )$$ from the Empirical Risk minimizer with a smoothest Regularizer: $$ f^* = arg \min_f \mathcal{E}_S(f) = \sum^{N}_{n=1} (f(x_n) - y_n)^2  + \lambda R(f) $$ $$ f^* = arg \min_f \mathcal{E}_S(f) = \sum^{N}_{n=1} (f(x_n) - y_n)^2  + \lambda \sum^{\infty}_{k=0} a_j \int^{\infty}_{- \infty} \left( \frac{d^k h}{d x^k} \right) dx$$ unfortunately, they do not show the derivation of this. Thus I was wondering if someone could show me how minimizing the ERM using that regularizer, one could derive the RBF kernel function. In particular I am very interested in the exact mathematical details and if there is any maths I need to learn I am motivated to learn it to understand this derivation. I believe they mentioned that this regularizer was for some simplified case (not sure which one) but I would be interested to start of in the simple explanation of this derivation (I believe its using only 1D calculus?) and then generalizing as it needed. As a first suggestion the generalization could be the answer to the question Why does minimizing $H[f] =\sum^{N}_{i=1}(y_i-f(x_i))^2+\lambda \| Pf \|^2 $ leads to solution of the form $ f(x) =\sum^N_{i=1}c_iG(x; x_i)+p(x)$? .","I was reading/watching CalTech's ML course and it said that one could derive the RBF Gaussian kernel from the solution to smoothest interpolation that minimizes squared loss. i.e. one can derive the predictor/interpolator: $$ f(x) = \sum^{K}_{k=1} c_k \exp( -\beta_k \| x - w_k \|^2 )$$ from the Empirical Risk minimizer with a smoothest Regularizer: $$ f^* = arg \min_f \mathcal{E}_S(f) = \sum^{N}_{n=1} (f(x_n) - y_n)^2  + \lambda R(f) $$ $$ f^* = arg \min_f \mathcal{E}_S(f) = \sum^{N}_{n=1} (f(x_n) - y_n)^2  + \lambda \sum^{\infty}_{k=0} a_j \int^{\infty}_{- \infty} \left( \frac{d^k h}{d x^k} \right) dx$$ unfortunately, they do not show the derivation of this.
