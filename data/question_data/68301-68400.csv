0,Paracompactness of CW complexes (rather long),Paracompactness of CW complexes (rather long),,"I finished reading Lee's 'introduction to topological manifolds' (2nd edition) and I'm currently tying up some loose ends. One thing I can't understand is the proof of paracompactness of CW complexes. The proof contains some mistakes I feel (perhaps wrongly), and although I get the general idea, there is one technical detail I can't work out. Lee uses a somewhat different approach (as far as I know), just to illustrate a technique of inductively building maps out of a CW complex skeleton par skeleton. He claims that any open cover $\left ( U_\alpha  \right )_{\alpha \in A}$ of a CW complex $X$ has a partition unity $\left ( \psi_\alpha  \right )_{\alpha \in A}$ subordinate to it, from which paracompactness follows (I guess because then $\left ( \psi_\alpha^{-1}\left \{ x \in X|  \psi_{\alpha }(x)\neq 0 \right \}\right )_{\alpha \in A}$ is a locally finite open refinement of $\left ( U_\alpha  \right )_{\alpha \in A}$). The aim is to inductively build a partition  of unity $\left ( \psi^n_\alpha  \right )_{\alpha \in A}$ of the n-skeleton $X_n$ subordinate to the open cover $\left ( U^n_\alpha  \right )_{\alpha \in A}$ of $X_n$, where $U^n_\alpha = U_\alpha \cap X_n$, as follows: for $n=0$, choose, if $x \in X_0$, any $\alpha(x) \in A$ such that $x \in U_{\alpha(x)}$. Then, set $\psi^0_{\alpha(x)}(x)= 1$ and $\psi^0_{\alpha}(x)= 0$ if $\alpha \neq \alpha(x)$. Then, suppose that we have found, for $k=0,\dots,n$, partitions of unity $\left ( \psi^k_\alpha  \right )_{\alpha \in A}$ of $X_k$ subordinate to $\left ( U^k_\alpha  \right )_{\alpha \in A}$, such that $ {\psi^k_\alpha}_{|X_{k-1} }=\psi^{k-1}_\alpha$ and, if $\psi^{k-1}_\alpha\equiv 0$ on an open subset $V$ of $X_{k-1}$, then there exists an open subset $V'$ of $X_k$ containing $V$ on which $\psi^{k}_\alpha \equiv 0$. Let $q:X_n\sqcup \bigsqcup_{\gamma \in \Gamma}  D^{n+1}_{\gamma}  \rightarrow X_{n+1}$be the quotient map realizing $X_{n+1}$ as an adjunction space obtained by attaching $n+1$- cells $D^{n+1}_{\gamma}$ to $X_n$ and let $\phi_\gamma : \partial D^{n+1}_{\gamma} \rightarrow X_n$ be the maps glueing $ \partial D^{n+1}_{\gamma}$ to $X_n$. First, set $\tilde{\psi}^n_{\alpha,\gamma}=\psi^n_\alpha \circ \phi_\gamma :\partial D^{n+1}_{\gamma} \rightarrow \left [ 0,1 \right ]$ and $\tilde{U}^{n+1}_{\alpha,\gamma}=q_{|D^{n+1}_\gamma}^{-1}(U^{n+1}_\alpha)$, so, in particular, $(\tilde{U}^{n+1}_{\alpha,\gamma})_{\alpha \in A}$ is an open cover of $D^{n+1}_\gamma$ and choose a partition of unity $(\eta_{\alpha,\gamma})_{\alpha \in A}$ of $D^{n+1}_\gamma$ subordinate to $(\tilde{U}^{n+1}_{\alpha,\gamma})_{\alpha \in A}$. For $\gamma \in \Gamma$ fixed, $(supp \  \psi^n_\alpha)_{\alpha \in A}$ is a locally finite family of subsets of $X_n$ by construction and since $\phi_\gamma(\partial D^{n+1}_{\gamma})$ is compact in $X_n$, it meets $supp \  \psi^n_\alpha$ for at most a finite amount of indices (I get that). Hence, only for finitely many indices $\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_k$, we have $\tilde{\psi}^n_\alpha \not\equiv 0$ (I get that). Let, for $C\subseteq \partial D^{n+1}_{\gamma} $, and $0<\varepsilon <1$, $C(\varepsilon)=\left \{ x \in D^{n+1}_{\gamma} |\frac{x}{\left \| x \right \|}  \in C \text{ and } 1-\varepsilon < \left \| x \right \| \leqslant 1 \right \}$, norm confer some homeomorphism from $ D^{n+1}_{\gamma}$ to the closed unit ball. For any $\alpha_j$ of the indices $\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_k$, $supp \  \tilde{\psi}^n_{\alpha_j,\gamma}$ is a non-empty compact subset of $\partial D^{n+1}_{\gamma}$ so of $D^{n+1}_{\gamma}$ and is contained in $\tilde{U}^{n+1}_{\alpha_j,\gamma}$ (I can work that out). Since $co \tilde{U}^{n+1}_{\alpha}$ is closed in $D^{n+1}_{\gamma}$ and disjoint from $supp \  \tilde{\psi}^n_{\alpha_j,\gamma}$  , one can find an $0<\varepsilon_j<1$ such that $supp \  \tilde{\psi}^n_{\alpha_j,\gamma} (\varepsilon_j)\subseteq \tilde{U}^{n+1}_{\alpha_j,\gamma}$ (I get that). Then, set $\varepsilon_\gamma =\min^k_{j=1} \varepsilon_j$ (I would feel more confident choosing $0<\varepsilon_\gamma <\min^k_{j=1} \varepsilon_j$ ) and let $\sigma: D^{n+1}_\gamma \rightarrow \left [0,1 \right ]$ be a bump function that is $1$ on $D^{n+1}_\gamma  \setminus \partial D^{n+1}_\gamma(\varepsilon_\gamma) $ and is supported in $\partial D^{n+1}_\gamma(\dfrac{\varepsilon_\gamma}{2})$. This seems wrong to me because $\partial D^{n+1}_\gamma(\dfrac{\varepsilon_\gamma}{2})$ and $D^{n+1}_\gamma  \setminus \partial D^{n+1}_\gamma(\varepsilon_\gamma) $ are disjoint. I think that $\partial D^{n+1}_\gamma(\dfrac{\varepsilon_\gamma}{2})$ should be replaced with something like $D^{n+1}_\gamma  \setminus \overline{\partial D}^{n+1}_\gamma(\dfrac{\varepsilon_\gamma}{2}) $ . So, let's do that. Then define $\tilde\psi ^{n+1}_{\alpha,\gamma}: D^{n+1}_\gamma \rightarrow \left [ 0,1 \right ]$ by $\tilde\psi ^{n+1}_{\alpha,\gamma}(x)=\sigma(x)\eta _{\alpha,\gamma}(x)+(1-\sigma(x))\tilde{\psi}^n_{\alpha,\gamma}(\frac{x}{\left \| x \right \|}) $. $\tilde\psi ^{n+1}_{\alpha,\gamma}$ is continuous, takes values in $\left [ 0,1 \right ]$, coincides with $\tilde\psi ^{n}_{\alpha,\gamma}$ on $\partial D^{n+1}_\gamma$ and $\sum_{\alpha \in A}\tilde\psi^{n+1}_{\alpha,\gamma}\equiv 1$. $supp \ \tilde{\psi}^{n+1}_{\alpha,\gamma}\subseteq \tilde{U}^{n+1}_{\alpha,\gamma}$ (I can work that out, but only if one chooses $\varepsilon_\gamma< \min^{k}_{j=1}\varepsilon_j$ ). Now, repeat this for every $\gamma \in \Gamma$. The map that coincides with $\psi^n_\alpha$ on $X_n$ and with $\tilde{\psi}^{n+1}_{\alpha,\gamma}$ on $D^{n+1}_\gamma$ passes to the quotient to yield the requested $\psi^{n+1}_\alpha$. Okay, here is my problem: I cannot relate the supports of $\psi^{n}_\alpha$ and the $\tilde{\psi}^{n+1}_{\alpha,\gamma}$ to the support of $\psi^{n+1}_\alpha$ accurately enough. I can only show that $supp \ \psi^{n+1}_\alpha \subseteq \overline{U}^{n+1}_\alpha$ . Any thoughts anyone? I can understand the rest of the proof, however, something seems not right, so, to be sure, here it is. To check that $(supp \ \psi^{n+1}_\alpha)_{\alpha \in A}$ is locally finite, suppose $x$ is in the interior of an $n+1$-cell $D^{n+1}_\gamma$. Lee claims that the cell itself is a neighbourhood of $x$ on which only finitely many of the $\psi^{n+1}_\alpha$ are non-zero. However, is this true? Identically zero $\tilde{\psi}^{n}_\alpha$ cán yield non-zero  $\tilde{\psi}^{n+1}_\alpha$. Having said that, there is an easy way to work around this, because of the use of the $\eta_{\alpha,\gamma}$ in the construction of the $\tilde{\psi}^{n+1}_\alpha$. Any comments would be grately appreciated, big thanks in advance.","I finished reading Lee's 'introduction to topological manifolds' (2nd edition) and I'm currently tying up some loose ends.

1,Is the complement of an injective continuous map $\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}^2$ with closed image necessarily disconnected?,Is the complement of an injective continuous map  with closed image necessarily disconnected?,\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}^2,"I am interested in the following Jordan curve theorem-esque question: Suppose that you are given a continuous, injective map $\gamma:  \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}^2$ such that the image is a closed subset of   $\mathbb{R}^2$.

The result then follows by the Jordan curve theorem.

9,Topological spaces in which every proper closed subset is compact,Topological spaces in which every proper closed subset is compact,,"Let $X$ be a topological space.  It is a well-known result that, if $X$ is compact, then every proper closed subset $Y \subset X$ is compact.  Out of curiosity, I would like to explore the converse of this statement: Let $X$ be a topological space with the property that every proper closed subset is compact.  Is $X$ itself compact? Of course, this question is only interesting when $X$ is infinite.  We can further restrict ourselves to spaces that have infinitely many open sets since every closed set, and indeed the space itself, would be compact otherwise.  If this result is false in general, what hypotheses can be added to make it so? Should this not hold, I'm interested in finding concrete examples of when it does .

Prove that any continuous function from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{Q}$ is constant. Here is my proof: Let $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{Q}$ be such a function. ? We first show that $\mathbb{Q}$ is disconnected. Let $p$ be an irrational number.

Moreover, $\mathbb{Q}$ is also totally disconnected, as any open subset $U$ of $\mathbb{Q}$ must contain two rational numbers and there is always an irrational number between the two, and we can use that rational number to create a disconnection. Therefore the only connected subsets of $\mathbb{Q}$ are the singleton sets $\{q\}$ , where $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ , which are closed. We will show that $f(\mathbb{R})$ must be connected. Assume not, then $$ f(\mathbb{R})= U\cup V, $$ where $U$ and $V$ are nonempty open subsets of $\mathbb{Q}$ such that $$ U \cap V= \emptyset .$$ This implies $$ \mathbb{R} = f^{-1} \big( U \cup V \big) = f^{-1}(U)\cup f^{-1}(V),  $$ where $f^{-1}(U),f^{-1}(V)$ are nonempty, nonintersecting subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ .

Now the collection $\{U_{x}: x \in C\}$ covers $C$ so by compactness we can find some natural k such that $C \subseteq \bigcup_{i=1}^{k} U_{x_{i}}(y)$ Now for simplicity let $U = \bigcup_{i=1}^{k} U_{x_{i}}(y)$, then $C \subseteq U$ and let $W(y) = \bigcap_{i=1}^{k} V_{x_{i}}(y)$. Then $W(y)$ is a neighborhood of $y$ and disjoint from $U$. Now consider the collection $\{W(y): y \in D\}$, this covers D so by compactness we can find some natural q such that $D \subseteq \bigcup_{j=1}^{q} W_{y_{j}}$. Finally set $V = \bigcup_{j=1}^{q} W_{y_{j}}$, then $U$ and $V$ are disjoint open sets containing $C$ and $D$ respectively.

55,Are there uncountably many non homeomorphic ways to topologize a countably infinite set?,Are there uncountably many non homeomorphic ways to topologize a countably infinite set?,,"Today I was fooling around a bit trying to count the topologies on a finite set. I didn't make much progress, so I did some googling and quickly discovered it is an open problem to give a closed form expression for the number $T_n$ of topologies on a set with $n$ elements. At this point I asked myself ""if I can't compute $T_n$, can I perhaps compute $T_\omega$?"". First I wondered whether it is even obvious that there are uncountably many ways to topologize a countably infinite set $X$. It is. For each $S \subset X$, $\{\varnothing, S, X\}$ is a topology so there are at least $c$ ways to topologize $X$. This is a bit of a cheat though since, up to homeomorphism, this topology depends only on the cardinalities of $S$ and $X-S$ for which there are only countably many possibilities. Thus we are lead naturally to the question in the title: Are there uncountably many non homeomorphic topologies on a countably infinite set? The most obvious approach that I could think of was to look at order topologies. Distinct ordinal numbers are not order-isomorphic and there are uncountably many countable ordinals so surely by considering the countable ordinals in their order topologies we exhibit uncountably many nonhomeomorphic spaces... right? There is a gap though because distinct ordinals can be homeomorphic. For instance, if $\alpha \geq \omega$ then $\alpha + 1, \alpha +2, \alpha +3, \ldots$ are all homeomorphic (we can sneak the $n$ isolated points at the end of $\alpha + (n+1)$ into the copy of the $\omega$ at the beginning of $\alpha + 1$). To close the gap, we need to prove that for any countable ordinal $\alpha$ there exists a countable ordinal $\beta > \alpha$ homeomorphic to no ordinal in $[0,\alpha]$. I would be flabbergasted if this did not hold, but to prove it would probably require more set theory than I have at my disposal. If my title question is easily answered (in the affirmative) then, as a follow up question, I would also be interested to know if we can actually determine the number of topologies on a countable set (either topologies proper, or topologies up to homeomorphism). At the moment it would seem I can do little more than supply the obvious upper bound of $2^c$ for both quantities... Added: There have been several nice answers. Nate (whose answer I accepted) provided probably the slickest way to resolve the title question. Martin answers the follow up question by showing that the existence of $2^c$ ultrafilters on $\omega$ (this is proved at his first link) implies the existence of $2^c$ topologies on $\omega + 1$ (hence $2^c$ topologies up to homeomorphism since there are only $c$ permutations of a countable set). Actually it seems the proof that there are $2^c$ ultrafilters can easily be adapted to prove the existence of $2^c$ topologies directly. I'll sketch the argument below while I convince myself I understand what's going on. Let $X$ be the (countable) set of all subsets of $\mathbf{R}$ which are finite unions of intervals with rational endpoints. For any of the $2^c$ sets $S \subset \mathbf{R}$ we get a basis $\mathscr{B}_S$ for a toplogy on $X$ consisting of all sets $U_S(F) := \{ x \in X : x \cap F = S \cap F \}$ as $F$ ranges over finite subsets of $\mathbf{R}$. This is a basis since if $x \in B(F_1) \cap B(F_2)$ then $x \in B(F_1 \cup F_2) \subset B(F_1) \cap B(F_2)$. It remains to check that different subsets of $\mathbf{R}$ give rise to different topologies. In fact, if $\mathscr{B}_T$ is a refinement of $\mathscr{B}_S$ then $S \subset T$. Suppose that $s \in S$. If $\mathscr{B}_T$ refines $\mathscr{B}_S$ then there should exist a finite subset $F \subset \mathbf{R}$ so that $U_T(F) \subset U_S(\{s\})$. Wlog $s \in F$ since $U_T(F \cup \{s\}) \subset U_T(F)$. If $s \notin T$ then we have $s \notin x$ for all $x \in U_T(F)$ while $s \in x$ for all $x \in U_S(\{s\})$ so these basis elements are disjoint. Thus $s \in T$ must obtain and we are done.","Today I was fooling around a bit trying to count the topologies on a finite set.

I will say such $\mathbf{F}$ are ordinally continuous . If we consider $\mathbf{ON}$ in the order topology, this definition of continuous coincides with topological continuity for non-decreasing $\mathbf{F}:\mathbf{ON}\to\mathbf{ON}$ . If we remove that requirement, though, there are functions that are ordinally continuous, but not topologically continuous, and vice versa. For example, defining $$\mathbf{F}(\xi)=\begin{cases}0 & \text{if }\xi=2\!\cdot\! n\!+\!1\text{ for some }n<\omega\\\xi & \text{otherwise}\end{cases}\qquad\text{and}\qquad\mathbf{G}(\xi)=\begin{cases}\omega+1 & \text{if }\xi=0\\\omega & \text{if }0<\xi<\omega\\\xi & \text{otherwise,}\end{cases}$$ then $\mathbf{F}$ is ordinally but not topologically continuous, and $\mathbf{G}$ is topologically but not ordinally continuous. Before I proceed to ask my question, let me clarify one thing. When I speak of a ""topology"" on $\mathbf{ON}$ , I'm not speaking of something that formally exists in ZF(C)--as such a creature would be a class of (sometimes proper) classes. Instead, we'll describe ""topologies"" on $\mathbf{ON}$ indirectly as follows.

Question : Is there a way to ""topologize"" $\mathbf{ON}$ such that the ordinally continuous functions $\mathbf{ON}\to\mathbf{ON}$ are precisely the topologically continuous functions $\mathbf{ON}\to\mathbf{ON}$ ? If so, what's an example? If not, how can one show that there is no way? Remark : When considering $\mathbf{ON}$ in the order topology, limit ordinals and limit points are identical. It would, of course, be ideal to find a topology in which this still held and where topologically continuous and ordinally continuous functions are the same, but I would still be interested in any topology satisfying only the latter. Current Goals : (A) I'd like to generalize Brian M. Scott's result from below to other limit ordinals.

61,Useful sufficient conditions for a topological space to be the underlying space of a topological group?,Useful sufficient conditions for a topological space to be the underlying space of a topological group?,,"Here is a question that I have had in my head for a little while and was recently reminded of. Let $X$ be a (nonempty!) topological space.  What are useful (or even nontrivial) sufficient conditions for $X$ to admit a group law compatible with its topology? There are many necessary conditions: for instance $X$ must be completely regular.  In particular, if it is a Kolmogorov space it must be a Urysohn space.  It must be homogeneous in the sense that the self-homeomorphism group $\operatorname{Aut}(X)$ acts transitively.  In particular $\operatorname{Aut}(X)$ must act transitively on the connected components of $X$. It is rather clear though that these conditions are nowhere near sufficient even for very nice topological spaces.  A recent question on this site calls attention to this: even for the class of smooth manifolds there are a sequence of successively more intricate necessary conditions but (apparently) no good sufficient conditions. What about for other classes of spaces?  Here are two examples: it suffices for $X$ to be discrete (i.e., every set is open) or indiscrete (i.e., only $\varnothing$ and $X$ are open).  These are, of course, completely trivial.  Can anyone do any better than this?  For instance: If $X$ is totally disconnected and compact (for me this implies Hausdorff), must it admit the structure of a topological group? Added : as some have rightly pointed out, the above necessary condition of homogeneity is not implied by my assumptions.  So let us assume this as well.

There is, it seems to me, a very small gap in his proof: about the function $f$ he constructs, he writes ""since $f$ vanishes only at $c$ "".  He hasn't argued for this, and depending on the choices of the sequence $\{f_n\}$ , $f$ might vanish at other points.  But no problem: if $\mathfrak{m}_c = \langle f_1,\ldots,f_n,\ldots \rangle$ , since there is obviously some continuous function on $[0,1]$ which vanishes only on $c$ (e.g. $I(x) = |x-c|$ ), if $\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} f_n^{-1}(0) \supsetneq \{c\}$ then these functions cannot generate $\mathfrak{m}_c$ .

Then we can recursively construct an unbounded subsequence: since the net is not bounded, there exists some $\nu_1$ with $\|y_{\nu_1}\| > 1$.

In the link, it is shown that every continuous map from the Cayley plane to itself has a fixed point and the argument (with easy modification) applies equally well to $\mathbb{R}P^{2n}$, $\mathbb{C}P^{2n}$ and $\mathbb{H}P^{2n}$. The leaves open the case of $\mathbb{R}P^{2n+1}$, $\mathbb{C}P^{2n+1}$, and $\mathbb{H}P^{2n+1}$. In the case $\mathbb{R}P^{2n+1}$, this space covers many the lens spaces, so in particular (via the Deck group), admits many fixed point free self maps (diffeomorphisms, in fact). In the case $\mathbb{C}P^{2n+1}$, the Lefschetz theorem shows that any continuous map without fixed points must act as $-1$ in $H^2$, and indeed, there is a such a map $(\mathbb{C}P^{2n+1}$ double covers a nonorientable manifold).  So again, there is a diffeomorphism with no fixed points. This leaves open the case of $\mathbb{H}P^{2n+1}$.  The same argument as in the previous case shows that $f$ must act as $-1$ in $H^4$.  This certainly can be achieved when $n=0$.  In this case, $\mathbb{H}P^1 = S^4$ and the antipodal map is a diffeomorphism which acts without fixed points. However, for $n > 0$, there is no such diffeomorphism.

This implies that any diffeomorphism must act as $+1$ on $H^4$.  I think Novikov's result on the rational invariance of Pontrjagin classes under homeomorphisms gives us the same result for homeomorphisms. Thus, if there is a map $f:\mathbb{H}P^{2n+1}\rightarrow \mathbb{H}P^{2n+1}$ without fixed points, it cannot be a homeomorphism.
