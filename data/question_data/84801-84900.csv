0,Finiteness of the Measure Space appearing in Spectral Theorem of Bounded Operators,Finiteness of the Measure Space appearing in Spectral Theorem of Bounded Operators,,"Consider the multiplication operator version of the spectral theorem for bounded operators in a Hilbert space. Quoted from Wikipedia: Let $A$ be a bounded self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space $H$ .  Then there is a measure space $(X, \Sigma, \mu)$ and a real-valued essentially bounded measurable function $f$ on $X$ and a unitary operator $U:H \to L^2(X, \mu)$ such that $U^\dagger T_f U = A$ where $T_f$ is the multiplication operator: $T_f [\varphi](x) = f(x) \varphi(x)$ and $\|T_f\| = \|f\|_\infty$ . It is not much work to find an example where this measure space is not unique. For example, one can look at the sum of the left shift and right shift operators in $L^2(\mathbb{Z})$ and use Fourier series to see that the space $X$ can be any real interval.

1,Uniqueness of the extension in Hahn-Banach,Uniqueness of the extension in Hahn-Banach,,"Thinking about when we can talk about uniqueness in Hahn-Banach theorem i came up with the following conjecture: Let $H$ a Hilbert space and $M$ a closed subspace of it.

I'm most interested in whether $\sigma(B) \subset \sigma(A) + B_\epsilon(0)$, but if this is false maybe the right statement is $\sigma(B) \subset \sigma(A) + B_{f(\epsilon)}(0)$ for some $f = o(1)$, with $f$ perhaps depending on one of $A$ if we keep it fixed and vary $B$. If this isn't clear, the kind of counterexample I'd be looking for is: an operator $A$ such that there are $B \to 0$ with $\sigma(A + B)$ at least a fixed distance (in the Hausdorff metric) from $\sigma(A)$.

Then the sum of the areas is the geometric series so it should sum to 1. But there are a lot of details I'm unsure about, ie that end function would be a countable sum of continuous function which doesn't seem like it needs to be a continuous function (fourier series etc). And it isn't apparent that this would be bounded for all $p < \infty$. Anywho, I am stumped. Does anybody have any ideas or would like to provide a hint?",,"['analysis', 'functional-analysis']"

My understanding of why these might be interesting is that they behave in a particle-like manner, experiencing things like elastic collisions and the like. Furthermore in cases like NLS, there is the soliton resolution conjecture which seems to roughly claim that the nonlinearity decomposes into a linear evolution plus soliton solutions. I have a rather vague question around this, being rather out of the loop, which is something like: why is the existence of soliton solutions mathematically or physically interesting in a broad sense? How come equations with these types of solutions are very popular to study these days? Secretly, I'm wondering: do soliton solutions help us characterize nonlinear equations in some broad sense the same way spectral theory does for linear equations?",,"['functional-analysis', 'partial-differential-equations', 'mathematical-physics', 'nonlinear-system', 'soliton-theory']"
46,Extension of functional calculus of continuous functions,Extension of functional calculus of continuous functions,,"On Reed & Simon's book , we can find the following theorem, which is called the continuous functional calculus . Notation: $\sigma(A)$ is the spectrum of the operator $A$ , $\mathscr{L}(\mathscr{H})$ is the space of all bounded linear maps on a Hilbert space $\mathscr{H}$ and $C(\sigma(A))$ is the space of all continuous functions defined on $\sigma(A)$ . Theorem: Let $A$ be a bounded self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space $\mathscr{H}$ . Then there exists a unique map $\phi: C(\sigma(A)) \to \mathscr{L}(\mathscr{H})$ with the following properties: (a) $\phi$ is an algebraic $*$ -homomorphism, that is: $$\phi(fg) = \phi(f)\phi(g) \quad \phi(\lambda f) = \lambda \phi(f) \quad \phi(1) = I \quad \mbox{and} \quad \phi(\bar{f}) = \phi(f)^{*}$$ (b) $\phi$ is continuous, that is, $||\phi(f)||_{\mathscr{L}(\mathscr{H})} \le C||f||_{\infty}$ for some $C>0$ .

The proof of this theorem is given by the authors and I have no problem with it. Later in the book, the authors discuss the extension of this theorem for bounded Borel measurable functions. In this latter case, $\phi$ is now a map $\hat{\phi}: B(\mathbb{R}) \to \mathscr{L}(\mathscr{H})$ , where $B(\mathbb{R})$ denotes the space of all bounded Borel measurable functions on $\mathbb{R}$ .

I have done the followings: We can get $\chi _{\Omega }(x) \in L^2(\Omega)$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ quite easily. The next thing is to show the existence of the weak derivative of $\chi_{\Omega}$. For $n=1$, $\Omega$ is an open interval. Let $\phi \in C_{c}^{\infty }(\Omega)$ be an arbitrary test function. We have $\int_{a}^{b}\chi _{(a,b) }\phi 'dx=\int_{a}^{b}\phi'dx =\phi(b)-\phi(a)=0$ So $\int_{a}^{b}\chi _{(a,b) }\phi 'dx=-\int_{a}^{b}0.\phi dx$, and the weak derivative of $\chi_{\Omega}$ is $0$. For $n\geq 2$, I get stuck and don't know if $\chi_{\Omega}$ has the weak derivative or not. Thank you very much for your help.",,"['functional-analysis', 'lebesgue-integral', 'sobolev-spaces']"

Analysis isn't really my thing but knowing lots of math is empowering and yadda yadda. Anyway the problem: Let $\mathcal{H}=\{f:[0,1]\rightarrow \mathbb{F} \,:\, f\text{ is absolutely continuous, }f(0)=0, f'\in\mathcal{L}^2(0,1)\}$ (where $\mathbb{F}$ is either $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$). Define $\langle f,g\rangle=\int_0^1 f'(t)\overline{g'(t)}\, dt$ Show $\mathcal{H}$ is a Hilbert space. So I'm happy that $\langle \cdot,\cdot\rangle$ defines an inner product, I just want to show completeness in the metric induced by the norm. So my first stab was given a cauchy sequence $\{f_n\}$ to define  $$g(x)=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} f_n'(x)\text{ (in $\mathcal{L}^2$'s norm)}$$  This defines $g$ almost everywhere as the sequence $f'(n)$ is Cauchy in $\mathcal{L}^2(0,1)$ (this is direct from the definition of $\mathcal{H}$'s norm). Then I want to define $f(x)=\int_0^x g(t)dt$. Now I am struggling to show that $f$ is absolutely continuous (it's been a while since real analysis, I could be missing something simple), I'm happy that FTC deals with $f(0)=0$ and $f'\in\mathcal{L}^2(0,1)$ once I've shown this.",,"['functional-analysis', 'measure-theory', 'continuity', 'hilbert-spaces', 'cauchy-sequences']"
90,"A basic question on dual space of $L^p[0,1]$",A basic question on dual space of,"L^p[0,1]","I recently started reading functional analysis on my own and have come about dual spaces and cannot get an intuitive understanding about them. This is where my intuition breaks down while understanding duals of $L^p[0,1]$ spaces for $1\le p<\infty$: Dual of $L^p[0,1]$ is $L^q[0,1]$ where $1/p+1/q=1$. Here, a dual space consists of 'Linear functionals' (say $l(.)$) that map elements in $L^p[0,1]$ to $R$, whereas $L^q[0,1]$ contains functions (say $f(.)$) that map real numbers to real numbers. In otherwords, the map $l(.)$ works on functions and the map $f(.)$ works on real numbers. How can the linear functionals (dual space) be the same as an elements in $L^q[0,1]$. I do not have a rigorous mathematics background, If this question is vague or trivial please provide references of better sources which contain simple examples.","I recently started reading functional analysis on my own and have come about dual spaces and cannot get an intuitive understanding about them.
