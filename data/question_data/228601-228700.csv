21,difference between join and union,difference between join and union,,"Is there a difference between the join operator, $\wedge$, and the union of a set? In particular, what is the join of $a \wedge b $ and $b \wedge c$? Is it $a\wedge b \wedge c$ or is it $0$?

The answer $0$ comes from a geometric algebra book studying projective geometry, where they identify the geometric exterior product (= Grassmann's exterior product) with the join operator.  Since the exterior product is anti-commutative and associative it follows that for vectors $a$, $b$, $c$, $a\wedge a=0 \implies (a\wedge b)\wedge(b\wedge c) = 0$. They went on to define the meet in terms of the exterior product $(a\vee b)^* = a^*\wedge b^*$ where the star denotes the dual of the (in this case) vectors $a$ and $b$. (see for example Universal Geometric Algebra by David Hestenes) The set union answer comes from a discussion of lattices and probabilities (different book) where they identify join and meet with set union and intersection.

In countability arguments that I have seen the numbers are laid out in a grid with 1,2,3,4,... as rows and columns and the number at the nth row and mth column is n/m. So what if we have an extra dimension k, that represents the power, so at depth 3 the power is 1/3 so it becomes $ ({\frac{n}{m}})^{(\frac{1}{k})} $. It should be possible to visit every position in the cube by a similar procedure akin to the one used for 2 dimensional grid. Any non fractional power will give another rational number so only 1/k is actually necessary. While this only appears to work for the solution to a polynomial, such solutions are not rational numbers. Which would make some sets of irrational numbers countable, but that doesn't quite make sense to me. So therefore there must be something wrong with my ideas but I don't know what it is.","I know that the the set of real numbers has been proved uncountable by mathematicians, so my question is why this is wrong. In countability arguments that I have seen the numbers are laid out in a grid with 1,2,3,4,... as rows and columns and the number at the nth row and mth column is n/m. So what if we have an extra dimension k, that represents the power, so at depth 3 the power is 1/3 so it becomes $ ({\frac{n}{m}})^{(\frac{1}{k})} $. It should be possible to visit every position in the cube by a similar procedure akin to the one used for 2 dimensional grid. Any non fractional power will give another rational number so only 1/k is actually necessary. While this only appears to work for the solution to a polynomial, such solutions are not rational numbers. Which would make some sets of irrational numbers countable, but that doesn't quite make sense to me.

Thus we have two order-isomorphic proper classes, $\mathrm{Ord}$ and $\mathrm{Card}$. And although we have retained the identification $[0,\alpha)=\alpha$ for $\alpha \in \mathrm{Ord}$, we have abandoned it for cardinals. Additionally, given cardinal numbers $\mu$ and $\nu$, lets write $[\mu,\nu)$ for the set of all cardinals $\kappa$ with $\mu \leq \kappa < \nu$. Furthermore, let $x \mapsto \underline{x}$ denote the unique order isomorphism $\mathrm{Ord}\rightarrow \mathrm{Card}$, so for example: if $\omega$ is the least infinite ordinal, then $\underline{\omega}$ is the least infinite cardinal. Also, let $\eta : \mathrm{Card} \rightarrow \mathrm{Ord}$ denote the proper class function that maps every cardinal number to its initial ordinal.

So here's what I've done so far: If a relation $R$ is reflexive, symmetric and transitive then $R$ is an equivalence relation. So I have to prove that $R$ is reflexive, symmetric and transitive. Reflexivity: Let $n \in \mathbb A$, $nRn \iff nn$ is a square natural number. But $nn=n^2$ which is a square number and is natural by closure of multiplication in $\mathbb N$. Symmetry: Let $n,m$ $\in A$. Suppose $nRm \implies nm$ is a square natural number. But $nm=mn$, which means $mn$ is a square natural number $\implies$ $mRn$. Transitivity: Let $n,m,p \in A$ and suppose $nRm$ and $mRp$, this means $nm=s^2$ and $mp=t^2$. Then $m \vert s^2$ and $m\vert t^2$ so $np=\frac{s^2t^2} {m^2} \in \mathbb N$.

This is a subject I was interested in before taking this course, particularly in some of the stranger aspects and implications of set theory and incomputable numbers. While I personally philosophically question the validity of claiming the existence of something you cannot write down, I understand formally the arguments that leading to the conclusion that there are more real numbers than there are computer programs; i.e. I can translate each possible finite length string of a finite selection of characters into an integer, and then show there is no bijection from the integers to the reals). My question here is if we are as limited in what we can write down as is typically assumed, namely: this proof assumes there are a finite number of characters. But is this in fact true? Given a piece of paper and a pen, are there really only a finite number of ways to arrange ink molecules on the paper to create a characters? (From my understanding of quantum mechanics, molecules are not limited in possible arrangements in position space; rather it limits the accuracy with which you can know a particle's state in position-momentum space, though this is besides the point). If there are, in fact, an uncountable number of characters we can write on a paper, does this make every real number computable? Can we make compilers that could handle this, or does this violate some part of the definition of a Turing Machine (with which I am admittedly only vaguely familiar). I tried a quick google search for this idea, and nothing seemed to come up, so I am curious if this has been explored. I would at the least be very curious to learn about theories of computation under the assumption that we can write programs using an uncountable , or greater, number of characters, and how that might actually work.
