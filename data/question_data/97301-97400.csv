First of all, notice that The denominator cancels out when $x^2 - 7x + 10 = 0 \Leftrightarrow x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{7^2 - 40}}{2} = \begin{cases} x_1 = 2 \\ x_2 = 5 \end{cases}$ , as well as when $x^2 + 1 = 0 \Leftrightarrow x=\pm i$ . Notice that the poles $2$ and $5$ are placed on the real axis, and the only one on the upper semiplane is $i$ . From Euler's identity we know that $e^{i \pi x} = \cos(\pi x) + i \sin(\pi x)$ . Therefore, we can rewrite the integral as $$\Im \left( \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{e^{\pi z}}{(z^2 - 7z + 10)(z^2 + 1)} dz \right) = \Im \left( \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{e^{i\pi z}}{(z-2)(z-5)(z+i)(z-i)} dz \right)$$ From residue theory, we know that $$\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{e^{i\pi z}}{(z-2)(z-5)(z+i)(z-i)} dz = 2\pi i Res(f(z); z=i) + \pi i Res(f(z); z=2) + \pi i Res(f(z); z=5)$$ Now were I'm not confident is calculating the residues. I can apply that, as all the poles are simple, $$Res(f(z); z=i) =  \lim_{z\to i} (z-i) f(z) = \lim_{z\to i} \frac{e^{i\pi z}}{(z-2)(z-5)(z+i)} = \frac{e^{-\pi}}{18i + 14}$$ $$Res(f(z); z=2) =  \lim_{z\to 2} (z-2) f(z) = \lim_{z\to 2} \frac{e^{i\pi z}}{(z-i)(z-5)(z+i)} = \frac{-e^{2i\pi}}{15}$$ $$Res(f(z); z=5) =  \lim_{z\to 5} (z-5) f(z) = \lim_{z\to 5} \frac{e^{i\pi z}}{(z-i)(z-2)(z+i)} = \frac{e^{5i\pi}}{78}$$ So $$\mathcal I=\Im \left(2\pi i \frac{e^{-\pi}}{18i + 14} + \pi i \frac{-e^{2i\pi}}{15} + \pi i \frac{e^{5i\pi}}{78} \right)$$ From here I have two concerns: How can I simpify the resulting expresion of the integral, if it is indeed the correct answer.

For the converse, suppose $f(z) \in \mathbb{C}$ for all $z \in \mathbb{C}_\infty$ . Then $f$ is entire and bounded and thus constant. We can therefore assume that $f(z_0) = \infty$ for some $z_0 \in \mathbb{C}$ (consider $f(1/z)$ if necessary). By continuity of $f$ the point $z_0$ cannot be an essential singularity of $f$ . In other words, $z_0$ is a removable singularity or a pole. By the uniqueness theorem, the poles cannot accumulate in $\mathbb{C}_\infty$ . Since the latter is compact, there can thus only be finitely many poles. Hence, after subtracting the principal part of the Laurent series of $f$ around each pole in $\mathbb{C}$ from $f$ , we obtain an entire function which grows at most like a polynomial. By Liouville's theorem, such a function must be a polynomial and we are done. I have a few questions regarding this: Using the continuity argument can we also conclude that $z_0$ must be a pole?

Why do some books define a branch on just an open subset whereas some books define it on an open connected subset? Why some texts define a branch to be continuous but then some texts take the extra leap and define the branch to be a holomorphic function? Here are some examples. In Sarason's Complex Function Theory, it states the definition: Let $G$ be an open connected subset of $\mathbb{C}-\{0\}$ . A branch of $\log z$ in $G$ is a continuous function $\ell$ in $G$ such that for each $z \in G$ , $\ell(z)$ is a logarithm of $z$ . In Ivan Wilde's Lecture Notes on Complex Analysis, we have: A branch of the logarithm is a pair $(D, f)$ , where $D$ is a domain (an open connected subset of $\mathbb{C}$ ) such that $0 \notin D$ and $f: D \to \mathbb{C}$ is continuous and satisfies $e^{f(z)} = z$ for all $z \in D$ . In Stein-Shakarchi's Complex Analysis, we have: Suppose that $\Omega$ is simply connected with $1 \in \Omega$ , and $0 \notin \Omega$ .

Then, a branch of $\log z$ on $\Omega$ is a holomorphic function $L: \Omega \to \mathbb{C}$ such that $e^{L(z)} = z$ for every $z \in \Omega$ . A lot of the definitions assume that the logarithm is defined on a domain/region/open-connected subset of $\mathbb{C}$ . Why is this so? Moreover, what do we lose if we define it on just an open, not necessarily connected subset of $\mathbb{C}$ ? Would this be the same case to as why we sometimes define holomorphic functions just on an open set rather than on a domain? The only thing that I could think why assuming connectedness is important is to be more careful in the sense that the branch wouldn't take two different values on different subsets whose union is the subset where the branch is defined.

The ""only if"" part is the same as proving that if the principle part of Laurent series expansion for the function around is an infinite sum, the limit doesn't exist which is the same as proving that it depends on the direction in which we approach . I tried to exhibit two different limits but failed mainly due to the fact that I couldn't deal with the arbitrary coefficients of the series (since this should hold for any function with an essential singularity). This is a problem in Apostol's mathematical analysis and he doesn't mention the Casorati–Weierstrass theorem so I suppose one should be able to solve the problem without depending on it.",f B'(0;a) z 0 n g(z) B(0;a) g(0) f(z)=z^ng(z) B'(0;a) 0 0,"['sequences-and-series', 'complex-analysis', 'laurent-series', 'analyticity', 'singularity']"

97,An heuristic description of parabolic points in rational iteration theory,An heuristic description of parabolic points in rational iteration theory,,"I've been digging around the iteration of rational functions. By chance I came across a mapping $R(z)$ such that there is only one reppelling fixed point  and two parabolic points. I'm still far from understading the texts in the field, e.g. Beardon's or the classical text by Milnor , but all mention that the study of a mapping with parabolic points is significantly more difficult than the case of attracting and reppelling fixed points. Can someone give, perhaps a heuristically, explanation why this analysis is more difficult? In particular, I would like to understand if the dynamics depends explicitly on the mapping (in which case there's nothing much to do, I guess), or if it's really ""difficult"" in the sense of the complexity of proving theorems about the dynamics. Examples will be much appreciated.","I've been digging around the iteration of rational functions.
