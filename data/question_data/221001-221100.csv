Suppose $X$ is the union of two points, say $1,2\in\mathbb{A}(\mathbb{C})$. Then $I(\{1,2\})=((x-1)(x-2))$ so $\Gamma(X)=\mathbb{C}[x]/I(X)=\mathbb{C}[x]/((x-1)(x-2))$, and I am pretty sure that this has finite dimension as a $\mathbb{C}$ vector space.

17,The Algebra-Geometric Motivation Behind Considering The Prime Spectrum of Arbitrary Rings,The Algebra-Geometric Motivation Behind Considering The Prime Spectrum of Arbitrary Rings,,"When being introduced to algebraic geometry I was told that it is all about finding solutions to polynomial equations.

Now, if I want to solve polynomials over, say $\Bbb R$ or even $\Bbb Z$ , then this correspondence does not hold any longer. Yet by considering $\Bbb Z \subseteq \Bbb Q \subseteq \Bbb C$ we can try to solve the equations in $\Bbb C$ and cut away noninteger solutions. So in this light it seems like the classical setting of algebraic geometry is completely sufficient and we should put most of our effort into studying $\operatorname{Spec}K[T_1,...,T_n]$ .

Show that every maximal ideal in $\mathbb{K}[X]$ determines a unique point $p \in \mathbb{A}^n$ with $p \in X$. I've tried a proof along the following lines. Let $M$ be a maximal ideal of $\mathbb{K}[X]$. Then there is a corresponding maximal ideal in $\mathbb{K}[x_1, \dots ,x_n]$, which must be of the form $\langle x_1 - p_1, \dots x_n - p_n \rangle$ for some $p=(p_1, \dots,p_n) \in \mathbb{A}^n$ by the Nullstellensatz. Then $p$ must be in $X$, since otherwise $M$ would be empty, contradicting the definition of a maximal ideal (obviously, some details have been omitted). However, this doesn't make use of the fact that $X$ is irreducible, leading me to believe that I'm missing something. Am I working along the right lines?

66,Are all rationally parametrized plane curves algebraic? How does one find their degree?,Are all rationally parametrized plane curves algebraic? How does one find their degree?,,"Suppose a plane curve is given parametrically by $x=p(t),y=q(t)$, where $p,q$ are rational functions. I originally assumed that this means that the parametrized curve is algebraic, i.e. that it is the zero set of a polynomial in $x$ and $y$, but now I have doubts. Take for starters the case where $p,q$ are polynomials of degrees $m$ and $n$ respectively. In simple examples like $x=t^2+2,y=t^3-1$ the algebraic equation is easy to obtain, $(x-2)^3=(y+1)^2$, and the degree of the curve appears to be $\text{max}(m,n)$ generically (of course one can make up degenerate examples like $x=t^3,y=t^3$, where it drops). But what about $x=t^5+t^2+1, y=t^6-t+1$? It's not like we can solve for $t$ in radicals, plug in, and take powers to eliminate the radicals to get an algebraic equation in terms of $x$ and $y$. And even when that's possible it is not clear what the degree will come out to be after taking all the powers. So my questions are: when are polynomially (or more generally rationally) parametrized plane curves algebraic? Is there an algorithm for finding the algebraic equation when there is one? Is there a way to find the algebraic degree without finding the equation? Is the degree generically $\text{max}(m,n)$ when the parametrizing polynomials have degrees $m,n$? I looked in Gibson's Elementary Geometry of Algebraic Curves, and Reid's Undergraduate Algebraic Geometry, but they only deal with converse questions, from equation to parametrization. EDIT: After searching I found out that converting parametric equations into implicit ones is called implicitization (the opposite of parametrization), and apparently it is a big thing in computational geometry and applications because it provides an efficient way of determining if a given point lies on a given curve (or surface).

Is this only true for $R$ a local ring or is it also true for any commutative ring? Is there a global version of this statement? Is it true that for any scheme $X$ there is a locally closed embedding $X \hookrightarrow Y$ into a normal scheme $Y$? Is there an official term for such an embedding? EDIT . Perfect answer by Pete below led me to the following additional question I should have asked above already: Is any noetherian ring a quotient of a normal noetherian ring?","In the book Étale cohomology by Milne I found on p. 37 (in the context of constructing the henselization of a local ring) the following claim:  ""Every ring is a quotient of a normal ring"". The same is used in Local rings by Nagata on p. 180. Why is this true? Both Milne and Nagata don't explain this so it seems I'm just too blind.

98,On the definition of degree of a hypersurface,On the definition of degree of a hypersurface,,"Let $f \in \mathbb{C}[x_1, ..., x_n]$ be a homogeneous polynomial of degree $d$. I was trying to understand the definition of degree of hypersurfaces. It says on Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_an_algebraic_variety that ""The degree of a hypersurface F = 0 is the same as the total degree of the homogeneous polynomial F defining it (granted, in case F has repeated factors, that intersection theory is used to count intersections with multiplicity, as in Bézout's theorem)."" I was a bit confused with this. So is the degree of a hypersurface $f = 0$ always the total degree of $f$ or is it different when $f$ has a repeated factor?
