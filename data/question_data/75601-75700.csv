0,Do $X$ and $kX$ have the same compact subsets only if $X$ is weak Hausdorff?,Do  and  have the same compact subsets only if  is weak Hausdorff?,X kX X,"I have a doubt on compactly generated spaces. The majority of the question is here for context, you can skip through the definitions and the facts mentioned to the question, if you're familiar with them. Thanks for any clarify. Let $X$ be a topological space. $X$ is said weak Hausdorff if every compact subset is closed; a subset $S\subset X$ is compactly closed if, for every continuous map $K\to X$ from a compact space $K$ , $f^{-1}(S)\subset K$ is closed; $X$ is said a $k$ -space if every compactly closed subset is closed. Let $kX$ be the topological space defined as follows: the underlying set is (the same of) $X$ ; a subset $S\subset kX$ is closed if and only if $S$ is compactly closed in $X$ . Fact 1. The identity  map on the underlying sets $i:kX\to X$ is continuous, and $S\subset kX$ is closed if and only if $i(S)\subset X$ is compactly closed. Fact 2. $kX$ is a $k$ -space. Let $C\subset kX$ be compactly closed, and let $f:K\to X$ be a continuous map from a compact space $K$ . $f$ factors as $i\circ f'$ , for a (unique) continuous map $f':K\to kX$ : the definition on the underlying sets is evident, and it is continuous because, for any closed $S\subset kX$ , we have $f'^{-1}(S)=f^{-1}(i(S))$ , which is closed as $i(S)$ is compactly closed. Now $f^{-1}(i(C))=f'^{-1}(C)$ , which is closed as $C$ is compactly closed, yielding the thesis. Fact 3. If $X$ is weak Hausdorff, also $kX$ is. Let $C\subset kX$ be compact. $i(C)$ is compact too, hence closed by hypothesis. So $C=i^{-1}(i(C))$ is closed. Fact 4. If $X$ is weak Hausdorff, if $C\subset X$ is compact also $i^{-1}(C)$ is. We show that the continuous map $i':i^{-1}(C)\to C$ induced by $i$ is a homeomorphism: it is sufficient to prove that $i'$ is closed. Let $S'\subset i^{-1}(C)$ be closed, so that $S'=S\cap i^{-1}(C)$ for some closed $S\subset kX$ . Then $i'(S')=i(S)\cap C$ , which is closed in $C$ since $i(S)$ is compactly closed. Question. Is it necessary that $X$ is weak Hausdorff for Fact 4 to be true? It was assumed on the text I'm reading, but it doesn't seem necessary. The point is that, in any space $X$ , holds this: ( $*$ ) if $S\subset X$ is compactly closed, then $S\cap C\subset C$ is closed for every compact $C\subset X$ ; if $X$ is weak Hausdorff, we know that, if $S\subset X$ satisfies ( $*$ ), then $S$ is compactly closed, but we don't need this direction in the proof of Fact 4, I think.","I have a doubt on compactly generated spaces.

1,Disconnectedness in the subspace topology again,Disconnectedness in the subspace topology again,,"Here is a question that is likely somewhat known (in the vein of Counterexamples in Topology). It comes from a past PhD qualifying exam. The question is basically about the situation where $X$ is a topological space and $Y$ is a disconnected subspace (in the subspace topology). In this case, combining the definitions, one can find two open sets $U$ and $V$ in $X$ such that $Y\subset U\cup V$ , $U\cap V\cap Y=\emptyset$ and $Y\cap U$ and $Y\cap V$ both non-empty. The general question is when can one expect $U$ and $V$ to be disjoint, rather than $U\cap V\cap Y$ to be empty. Specifically, If $X$ is compact Hausdorff and $Y$ is a disconnected subspace, can one find disjoint open subsets $U,V$ of $X$ such that $Y\subset U\cup V$ and $Y\cap U$ and $Y\cap V$ are both non-empty?

As well known, the complex projective plane $\mathbb{C}P^2$ can be obtained from the sphere $\mathbb S^2$ by attaching a 4-dimensional cell along the Hopf map $\rho: \mathbb S^3\to \mathbb S^2.$ In other words, we have the following CW complex structure for $\mathbb{C}P^2$ : $$ \mathbb{C}P^2 = (\mathbb S^2\sqcup \mathbb D^4)/\sim\ = \mathbb S^2\cup_{\rho} \mathbb D^4$$ where the identification is given by $x\sim \rho (x)$ for $x\in \mathbb S^3$ . Taking the suspension of $\mathbb{C}P^2$ , we have $$\Sigma\mathbb{C}P^2 = (\mathbb S^3\sqcup S^1\sqcup \mathbb D^5)/\sim\ = \mathbb S^3\cup_{\rho} (\mathbb S^1\sqcup \mathbb D^5)$$ where the identification is given by identifying the basepoints of $\mathbb S^3$ and $\mathbb S^1$ and collapsing the $\mathbb S^1$ factor to a point. We can further simplify this space by noting that $\mathbb S^1\sqcup \mathbb D^5$ is homeomorphic to $\mathbb S^5$ via the map $(\theta,x)\mapsto(\cos\theta x,\sin\theta x)$ for $\theta\in[0,\pi]$ and $x\in \mathbb D^5$ , which identifies the equator of $\mathbb S^5$ with $\mathbb S^1\subseteq \mathbb S^5$ . Under this homeomorphism, the Hopf map $\rho$ becomes a map $g: \mathbb S^3\to \mathbb S^5$ that sends the equator of $\mathbb S^3$ to the equator of $\mathbb S^5$ and the north and south poles of $\mathbb S^3$ to the two points where the equator of $\mathbb S^5$ intersects the $\mathbb S^3$ factor of $\Sigma\mathbb{C}P^2$ .

16,Is a smooth function with bounded partial derivatives defined on an open set in Euclidean space bounded?,Is a smooth function with bounded partial derivatives defined on an open set in Euclidean space bounded?,,"This question is a follow up to this one , which was answered essentially in the negative. So I am trying to find another way. I have a connected bounded open set $X \subset R^n$ ; then I know it is also path-connected. I also have a smooth (say at least $C^2$ ) function $u$ on $X$ to the positive reals $P$ . I also know that the absolute value of the partials $\partial u/\partial x_i,\; 1 \leq i \leq n$ are uniformly bounded on $X$ . Finally, I have a limit point $z$ of $X$ and a sequence $\{z_n\} \subset X$ approaching $z$ . I would like to show that $\{u(z_n)\}$ is bounded (so I can extend it). I don't know that $X$ is convex, so I can't use that. Instead, my idea is to integrate $u$ along paths $l(z_1,z_k) \subset X, \; k = 2,3,\ldots$ , where $l(z_1,z_k)$ is of course the path in $X$ connecting $z_1$ and $z_k$ . I would then show that this sequence of integrals is bounded by using the boundedness of the partials of $u$ . I could then conclude that $u(z_n)$ itself is bounded. There's only one problem : While I believe, because $u$ is $C^2$ , that $l(z_1,z_k)$ has finite length, I don't know that $\lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} l(z_1,z_k)< \infty$ (so I can't use the typical argument that the value of the integral is bounded by the bound on the partials times the length of the domain of integration). Is there any way to show that in this particular situation the limit of the length of the paths is finite? Perhaps by showing there is a neighborhood $U(z)$ of $z$ such that $u$ is bounded on the ""last piece"" $U(z) \bigcap X$ ? I am wary of drawing any conclusions in this situation because I know how crazy paths (even in $R^n$ ) can be. Any ideas appreciated. Really. Edit : Thanks to Paul Frost for suggesting edits (above in bold) to make things clearer.

Edit : Martin R seems to have provided a clever counter-example showing the answer to my question is no. I am still hopeful of getting the result I need as $X$ is actually the image, by an open map (a projection), of an $n$ -dimensional integral manifold $L$ .

In this part of the proof he shows that a $G_{\delta}$ -subspace Y of a completely metrizable space $(X,d)$ is completely metrizable. For this, he defines the following metric. Sadly, he skips over why this new metric induces the subspace topology. Here is the relevant part of the proof: (screenshot) $\quad$ For the second assertion, let $Y=\bigcap_{n} U_{n}$ , with $U_{n}$ open in $X$ . Let $F_{n}=X \backslash U_{n}$ . Let $d$ be a complete compatible metric for $X$ . Define a new metric on $Y$ , by letting $$ d^{\prime}(x, y)=d(x, y)+\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \min \left\{2^{-n-1},\left|\frac{1}{d\left(x, F_{n}\right)}-\frac{1}{d\left(y, F_{n}\right)}\right|\right\} . $$ It is easy to check that this is a metric compatible with the topology of $Y$ .

35,Is a cylindroid a manifold with corners?,Is a cylindroid a manifold with corners?,,"First of all to follows we remember some elementary definitions and results about manifolds. Definition A function $f$ defined in a subset $S$ of $\Bbb R^k$ is said of class $C^r$ if it can be extended to a function $\phi$ (said $C^r$ -extension) that is of class $C^r$ in a open neighborhood of $S$ . Lemma If $f$ is a function defined in a subset $S$ of $\Bbb R^n$ such that for any $x\in S$ there exist a function $f_x$ defined in a neighborhood of $x$ that is of class $C^r$ and compatible with $f$ on $U_x\cap S$ then $f$ is of class $C^r$ . Lemma If $U$ is an open set of $H^n_k:=\Bbb R^{n-k}\times[0,+\infty)^k$ for any $k\le n$ then the derivatives of two different extensions $\phi$ and $\varphi$ of a $C^r$ -function $f$ agree in $U$ . Definition A $k$ -manifold with boundary/corners in $\Bbb R^n$ of calss $C^r$ is a subspace $M$ of $\Bbb R^n$ whose points have a neighborhood $V$ in $M$ that is the immage of a homeomorphism $\phi$ of calss $C^r$ defined an open set $U$ of $\Bbb R^k$ or of $H^k_1/H^k_m$ and whose derivative has rank $k$ . So now let be $M$ a $(n-1)$ -manifold with boundary of class $C^r$ in $\Bbb R^n$ and thus let be $\gamma$ a injective curve defined in the unit interval $I:=[0,1]$ such that $\gamma(0)=0$ and such that the unit tangent vector not lies -for each $t\in I$ - to the tangent space at any point of $M$ . So we call cylindroid $C$ of trajectory $\gamma$ and of section $M$ the set $$ C:=\bigcup_{t\in I}\big(M+\gamma(t)\big) $$ that is obtained moving along $\gamma$ the points of $M$ . Click here to see an example. So if $\xi\in C$ then there exist a coordinate patch $\alpha:U\rightarrow V$ and $t\in I$ such that $$ \xi=\alpha(x)+\gamma(t) $$ for any $x\in U$ and thus let be $\phi$ the function from $U\times I$ to $\Bbb R^n$ defined through the equation $$ \phi(x,t):=\alpha(x)+\gamma(t) $$ for any $(x,t)\in U\times I$ and then we prove that any restriction of this function is a coordinate patch about $\xi$ . So we observe that the immage of $\phi$ is open in $C$ : indeed the immage $V$ of $\alpha$ is an open set of $M$ so that there exist an open set $W$ of $\Bbb R^n$ whose intersection with $M$ is $V$ and so remembering that the translation is a bijection we observe that $$ \phi[U\times I]=\bigcup_{t\in I}\big(V+\gamma(t)\big)=\bigcup_{t\in I}\Big((W\cap M)+\gamma(t)\Big)=\bigcup_{t\in I}\Big(\big(W+\gamma(t)\big)\cap\big(M+\gamma(t)\big)\Big)=\\ \Biggl(\bigcup_{t\in I}\big(W+\gamma(t)\big)\Biggl)\cap\Biggl(\bigcup_{t\in I}\big(M\cap\gamma(t)\big)\Biggl)=\Biggl(\bigcup_{t\in I}\big(W+\gamma(t)\big)\Biggl)\cap C $$ and thus we conclude that the immage of $\phi$ is open in $C$ because the translations are a homeomorphism and thus $W+\gamma(t)$ is open for each $t\in I$ . Now if $\overset{°}M$ and $\partial M$ are the sets of the interior and boundary points of $M$ then we observe that $C$ is union of the sets $$ \bigcup_{t\in\text{int}\, I}\big(\overset{°}M+\gamma(t)\big)\,\,\,\text{and}\,\,\,\bigcup_{t\in\text{bd}\, I}\big(\overset{°}M+\gamma(t)\big)\,\,\,\text{and}\,\,\,\bigcup_{t\in I}\big(\partial M+\gamma(t)\big) $$ so that we analyse separately the case where $\xi$ is an element of the first set and the case where $\xi$ is an element of the second or either of the third: in particular this means to analyse separately the case where the set $ U $ is open in $ \Bbb R^{n-1} $ and $ t $ is an element of $ \text{int} \, I $ and the case where this is not and so just this is what we will do to follows -clearly this can be done independentely from the definition of the three mentioned sets   nevertheless we decided to define them because we thought it makes more clear the following argumentetions, that's all. In particular in the example posted above these sets are respectively the invisible part, the red part, the green and balck parts. So first of all we observe that if $\xi$ is an element of the first set then $\alpha$ is a coordinate patch of $M$ defined in an open set $U$ of $\Bbb R^{n-1}$ and so the map $\phi$ defined above is a diffeomorphism in a neighborhood at any point of $U\times\text{int}\,I$ where is contained $\phi^{-1}(\xi)$ , because if the unit tangent vector of $\gamma$ not lies to the tangent space at any point of $M$ then the derivative of $\phi$ is an isomorphism and so the statement follows directely from the inverse function theorem. So we conclude that the set $$ \bigcup_{t\,\in\,\text{int}\,I}\big(\overset{°}M+\gamma(t)\big) $$ is a $n$ -manifold without boundary. In particular in this way we proved that the invisible part of the linked example is a manifold without boundary. Now if $\xi$ is a not an element of the first set then the previous argumentations hold only with some efforts that we show to follow. So the functions $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ can be extended to two $C^r$ -functions $\beta$ and $\psi$ defined in a open neighborhood of $U$ and $I$ respectively so that the function $\phi$ can be extended to a function $\varphi:=\beta+\psi$ defined in a open neighborhood of $U\times I$ and in particular at any point $(x,t)$ of $U\times I$ this function has not singular derivative so that by the inverse function theorem there exist a (rectangular) open neighborhood $W_x\times W_t$ where $\varphi$ is a diffeomorphism. Now the set $\varphi[W_x\times W_t]$ is open in $\Bbb R^n$ and it is not disjoint from $C$ -indeed $W_x\times W_t$ is not disjoint from $U\times I$ and $\varphi$ is compatible with $\phi$ in $U\times I$ and the immage of $\phi$ is contained in $C$ - so that by the continuity of $\phi$ the set $$  \phi^{-1}[\varphi[W_x\times W_t]] $$ is (not empty and) open in $U\times I$ and contains $W_x\times W_t\cap U\times I$ where $\phi$ is a diffeomorphism. So if we prove that the immage of $W_x\times W_t\cap U\times I$ through $\phi$ is open in $C$ then we conclude that the restriction of $\phi$ to this set is a coordinate patch defined in a open set of $\Bbb R^{n-1}\times[0,+\infty)$ or in a open set of $\Bbb R^{n-2}\times[0,+\infty)^2$ if $U$ is open in $\Bbb R^{n-1}$ and $t$ is not an element of $\text{int}\, I$ or if $U$ is not open in $\Bbb R^{n-1}$ and $t$ is an element of $\text{int}\, I$ or either if $U$ is not open in $\Bbb R^{n-1}$ and $t$ is not an element of $\text{int}\, I$ respectively. So how do this? Could someone help me, please? To follows some observations that I tried to use: naturally you are not constrained to read it if you do not desidre. OBSERVATION If the function $\phi$ was injective in $U\times I$ the statement follows immediately because in particular the function $\varphi$ would be injective in $W_x\times W_t\cup U\times I$ so that $$ \phi[W_x\times W_t\cap U\times I]=\varphi[W_x\times W_t\cap U\times I]=\varphi[W_x\times W_t]\cap\varphi[U\times I]=\\ \varphi[W_x\times W_t]\cap\phi[U\times I] $$ having remembered that $\varphi$ and $\phi$ are compatible in $U\times I$ . So in particular we observe that the injectivity of $\phi$ follows immediately if the set $M+\gamma(t_0)$ and $M+\gamma(t_1)$ was disjoint for any $t_0,t_1\in I$ such that $t_0\neq t_1$ and in particular I tried to prove this using the injectivity of $\gamma$ that above I did not use. Moreover since $\alpha$ is a homeomorphism and since $W_x$ is open in $\Bbb R^{n-1}$ then $\alpha[W_x\cap U]$ is open in $M$ and so exist a open set $W$ of $\Bbb R^n$ whose intersection with $M$ is $\alpha[W_x\cap U]$ and thus implementing the argumentations used above it follows that $$ \phi[W_x\times W_t\cap U\times I]=...=\Biggl[\bigcup_{t\in W_t\cap I}\big(W+\gamma(t)\big)\Biggl]\cap\Biggl[\bigcup_{t\in W_t\cap I}\big(M+\gamma(t)\big)\Biggl] $$ so that if the set $\Biggl[\bigcup_{t\in W_t\cap I}\big(M+\gamma(t)\big)\Biggl]$ and $\Biggl[\bigcup_{t\in I\setminus W_t}\big(M+\gamma(t)\big)\Biggl]$ was disjoint then $\phi[W_x\times W_t\cap U\times I]$ was open in $C$ and this surely happens if the set $M+\gamma(t_0)$ and $M+\gamma(t_1)$ was disjoint for any $t_0,t_1\in I$ such that $t_0\neq t_1$ .","First of all to follows we remember some elementary definitions and results about manifolds. Definition A function defined in a subset of is said of class if it can be extended to a function (said -extension) that is of class in a open neighborhood of . Lemma If is a function defined in a subset of such that for any there exist a function defined in a neighborhood of that is of class and compatible with on then is of class . Lemma If is an open set of for any then the derivatives of two different extensions and of a -function agree in . Definition A -manifold with boundary/corners in of calss is a subspace of whose points have a neighborhood in that is the immage of a homeomorphism of calss defined an open set of or of and whose derivative has rank . So now let be a -manifold with boundary of class in and thus let be a injective curve defined in the unit interval such that and such that the unit tangent vector not lies -for each - to the tangent space at any point of . So we call cylindroid of trajectory and of section the set that is obtained moving along the points of . Click here to see an example. So if then there exist a coordinate patch and such that for any and thus let be the function from to defined through the equation for any and then we prove that any restriction of this function is a coordinate patch about . So we observe that the immage of is open in : indeed the immage of is an open set of so that there exist an open set of whose intersection with is and so remembering that the translation is a bijection we observe that and thus we conclude that the immage of is open in because the translations are a homeomorphism and thus is open for each . Now if and are the sets of the interior and boundary points of then we observe that is union of the sets so that we analyse separately the case where is an element of the first set and the case where is an element of the second or either of the third: in particular this means to analyse separately the case where the set is open in and is an element of and the case where this is not and so just this is what we will do to follows -clearly this can be done independentely from the definition of the three mentioned sets   nevertheless we decided to define them because we thought it makes more clear the following argumentetions, that's all. In particular in the example posted above these sets are respectively the invisible part, the red part, the green and balck parts. So first of all we observe that if is an element of the first set then is a coordinate patch of defined in an open set of and so the map defined above is a diffeomorphism in a neighborhood at any point of where is contained , because if the unit tangent vector of not lies to the tangent space at any point of then the derivative of is an isomorphism and so the statement follows directely from the inverse function theorem. So we conclude that the set is a -manifold without boundary. In particular in this way we proved that the invisible part of the linked example is a manifold without boundary. Now if is a not an element of the first set then the previous argumentations hold only with some efforts that we show to follow. So the functions and can be extended to two -functions and defined in a open neighborhood of and respectively so that the function can be extended to a function defined in a open neighborhood of and in particular at any point of this function has not singular derivative so that by the inverse function theorem there exist a (rectangular) open neighborhood where is a diffeomorphism. Now the set is open in and it is not disjoint from -indeed is not disjoint from and is compatible with in and the immage of is contained in - so that by the continuity of the set is (not empty and) open in and contains where is a diffeomorphism. So if we prove that the immage of through is open in then we conclude that the restriction of to this set is a coordinate patch defined in a open set of or in a open set of if is open in and is not an element of or if is not open in and is an element of or either if is not open in and is not an element of respectively. So how do this? Could someone help me, please? To follows some observations that I tried to use: naturally you are not constrained to read it if you do not desidre. OBSERVATION If the function was injective in the statement follows immediately because in particular the function would be injective in so that having remembered that and are compatible in .

Let $C^*$ be the torus as an identification space of $[0,1] \times [0,1]$ under the quotient map $g:[0,1] \times [0,1] \rightarrow C^{*}$ . Then $C^*=\{\{(x,0),(x,1)\}|0 < x < 1\} \cup\{\{(0,y),(1,y)\}|0 < y < 1\} \cup \{\{(x,y)\}|0 < x < 1, \ 0<y<1\} \cup\{\{(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1)\}\}$ Define the function $f:C^* \rightarrow S^1 \times S^1$ by $f(\{(x,y)\})=((\cos 2 \pi x,\sin 2 \pi x),(\cos 2 \pi y, \sin 2 \pi y)),0<x<1,0<y<1,f(\{(x,0),(x,1)\})=((\cos 2 \pi x,\sin 2 \pi x),(1, 0)),f(\{(0,y),(1,y)\})=((1,0),(\cos 2 \pi y, \sin 2 \pi y)),f(\{(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1)\})=((1,0),(1,0))$ $C^*$ is compact since it is the surjective image of the continuous function $g$ . Similarly, $S^1 \times S^1$ is Hausdorff, since it is a subspace of the Hausdorff space $\mathbb{R}^2 \times \mathbb{R}^2$ . Because of this it suffices to show $f$ is a continuous bijection, in order to prove it is a homeomorphism. $f(\{(x,y)\}=f(\{(w,z)\} \implies  ((\cos 2 \pi x,\sin 2 \pi x),(\cos 2 \pi y, \sin 2 \pi y))=((\cos 2 \pi w,\sin 2 \pi w),(\cos 2 \pi z, \sin 2 \pi z)) \implies x=w,y=z \implies \{(x,y)\}=\{(w,z)\}$ , similarly $f(\{(x,0),(x,1)\})=f(\{(w,0),(w,1)\}) \implies \{(x,0),(x,1)\}=\{(w,0),(w,1)\}$ and $f(\{(0,y),(1,y)\})=f(\{(0,z),(1,z)\}) \implies \{(0,y),(1,y)\}=\{(0,z),(1,z)\}$ so that $g$ is injective. Let $((\cos 2 \pi x,\sin 2 \pi x),(\cos 2 \pi y, \sin 2 \pi y)) \in S^1 \times S^1$ . If $x=0,y \neq 0$ then $f(\{(0,y),(1,y)\})=((1,0),(\cos 2 \pi y, \sin 2 \pi y))$ . If $x \neq 0,y=0$ then $f(\{(x,0),(x,1)\})=((\cos 2 \pi x,\sin 2 \pi x),(1, 0))$ . If $x=0,y=0$ then $f(\{(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1)\})=((1,0),(1,0))$ . Otherwise $f(\{(x,y)\}=((\cos 2 \pi x,\sin 2 \pi x),(\cos 2 \pi y, \sin 2 \pi y))$ . So that the function is surjective. Finally consider the quotient map $g:[0,1] \times [0,1] \rightarrow C^*$ . $f$ is continuous if and only if $f \circ g$ is continuous by one of the well known theorems. Now for each $1 \leq i \leq 2$ , the projection function $\pi_i \circ f \circ g:[0,1] \times [0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ is continuous since $(\pi_1 \circ f \circ g)(x,y)=(\cos 2 \pi x,\sin 2 \pi x), (\pi_2 \circ f \circ g)(x,y)=(\cos 2 \pi y, \sin 2 \pi y)$ are continuous.

When is the restriction $p \mid_A : A \to Y$ a quotient map? This question occurs in hidden form in the context of projective spaces. Let $\mathbb K = \mathbb R, \mathbb C$ .

Let L denote the ordered set $S_{\Omega}\times[0,1)$ in the dictionary order, with its smallest element deleted. The set L is a classical example in topology called the long line . Theorem: The long line is path connected and locally homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}$ , but it cannot be imbedded in $\mathbb{R}$ . The structure of the proof is given by Munkres. (a) Let X be an ordered set; let $a<b<c$ be points of X. Show that $[a,c)$ has the order type of $[0,1)$ iff both $[a,b)$ and $[b,c)$ have the order type of $[0,1)$ . Assume $[a,b)$ and $[b,c)$ have the order type of $[0,1)$ . Then there exist order-isomorphisms $f:[a,b)\rightarrow [0,\frac{1}{2})$ and $g:[b,c)\rightarrow [\frac{1}{2},1)$ , because $[0,1)$ has the same order type as $[0,1/2)$ . Define $h: [a,c) \rightarrow[0,1)$ as follows: $$h(x) = \begin{cases}        f(x) \text{ if } x\in [a,b) \\       g(x) \text{ if } x\in [b,c)    \end{cases}$$ $h$ is an order-isomorphism, as $p<q$ is true iff $h(p)<h(q)$ . Conversely, assume $[a,c)$ has the order type of $[0,1)$ . Then there exists an order-isomorphism $f:[a,c)\rightarrow [0,1)$ . Restricting the domain to $[a,b)$ gives a new order-isomorphism $g:[a,b)\rightarrow [0,d)$ , where $d\in (0,1)$ . $[0,d)$ is of the order type of $[0,1)$ ; multiplying by $1/d$ is an order isomorphism. Similarly, restricting the domain of $f$ to $[b,c)$ gives order-isomorphism $h:[b,c) \rightarrow [d,1)$ , where $d\in (0,1)$ . (b) Let X be an ordered set. Let $x_0 < x_1 < ...$ be an increasing sequence of points of X; suppose $b=\sup \{x_i\}$ . Show that $[x_0,b)$ has the order type of $[0,1)$ iff each interval $[x_i,x_i+1)$ has the order type of $[0,1)$ . Proving that $[x_0,b)$ having order type $[0,1)$ implies the same for the given intervals is simple, already having proved $(a)$ . Begin with $i=1$ : $[x_0,x_1), [x_1,b)$ is a partition of a set of the same form as we saw in $(a)$ ; thus each must have the same order type as $[0,1)$ . We proceed by induction, considering now the set $[x_1,b)$ and the sequence $x_1<x_2<...$ The proof is the same. edit: Conversely, assume each interval $[x_{i},x_{i+1})$ has order type $[0,1)$ . We seek to construct an order-isomorphism $f:[x_0,b)\rightarrow [0,1)$ by assigning each $[x_{i},x_{i+1})$ to a unique section of $[0,1)$ , as $[x_0,b)=\sqcup_{i\in \mathbb{Z}^{+}}[x_{i},x_{i+1})$ . Define $U_0=[0,\frac{1}{2})$ . Then inductively define $U_{i+1}=[\sup \{ U_{i}\},\sup \{ U_{i}\}+\frac{1}{2^{i+1}})$ , each of which clearly have order type $[0,1)$ and are pairwise-disjoint. Note that the upper bounds of $U_i$ converge to $1$ . Thus we can define order-isomorphisms $f_i:[x_i,x_{i+1})\rightarrow U_i$ , and thereby order-isomorphism $f:[x_0,b)\rightarrow [0,1)$ by the union of all $f_i$ . (c) Let $a_0$ denote the smallest element of $S_{\Omega}$ . For each element $a$ of $S_{\Omega}$ different from $a_0$ , show that the interval $[a_0 \times 0, a\times 0)$ of $L$ has the order type of $[0,1)$ . [ Hint : Proceed by transfinite induction. Either a has an immediate predecessor in $S_{\Omega}$ , or there is an increasing sequence $a_i$ in $S_{\Omega}$ with $a = \sup \{ a_i \}$ ] $[a_0,a)$ is countable by the definition of $S_{\Omega}$ . Following the hint: if $a$ has an immediate predecessor, $b$ , then $[b \times 0, a \times 0)$ has the order type of $[0,1)$ (all points in this set are of the form $b\times x$ , where $x\in [0,1)$ ). By backwards induction to $a_0$ any finite section of $S_{\Omega}$ , of which $a$ is the largest element, is order isomorphic to $[0,1)$ . If $a$ is not the largest element of a finite section of $S_{\Omega}$ , then there is an increasing sequence $a_i$ in $S_{\Omega}$ with $a = \sup \{ a_i \}$ , this sequence being exactly every element of $S_{\Omega}$ strictly less than $a$ , in order (which must be countable). Each $a_{i+1}$ in this sequence has an immediate predecessor, namely $a_1$ , so each $[a_{i}\times 0,a_{i+1}\times 0)$ must be order isomorphic to $[0,1)$ by the above argument.

Extending $(c)$ to include sets of the form $[a,b), a,b\in L$ is trivial - simply add/subtract sets from the ends - I will assume this.  This implies that $[a,b]$ has the same order type as $[0,1]$ .

76,"Defining homotopy fiber ""naturally""","Defining homotopy fiber ""naturally""",,"For a map $f\colon A\to B$ , many authors define the mapping fibration $E_f\to B$ , where $E_f$ consists of pairs $(a,\gamma)\in A\times B^I$ with $\gamma(0)=f(a)$ , and the fibration map is $(a,\gamma)\mapsto \gamma(1)$ . The fiber $F_f$ is the homotopy fiber, and consists of pairs $(a,\gamma)$ with $\gamma$ a path from $f(a)$ to a basepoint $b\in B$ . At the same time, there are many god-given fibrations lying around that are confusing similar. For example, we have $B^I\to B$ , with $\gamma\mapsto \gamma(0)$ . As sets, $E_f$ is just the pullback of $f$ along this fibration. However, this doesn't actually produce the right fibration map $E_f\to B$ is any obvious way. So my (soft) question is the following: Is there a way to define the homotopy fiber of a map $f\colon A\to B$ which is ""natural"" in the colloquial sense?

78,Closure and interior of a connected set $A$,Closure and interior of a connected set,A,"Let $\overline{A}$ be the closure of $A$ , and $A^{\circ}$ be the interior of $A$ . We assume that $A$ be connected. 1. Is $\overline{A}$ connected? My answer is yes. Because, if $\overline{A}$ is not connected, we can write $$\overline{A}=B\cup C$$ such that $B,C$ are separated. i.e., no limit point of $B$ is in $C$ and vice versa. Also, both $B,C$ are clopen in $\overline{A}$ . And note that $B,C$ are non-empty. WLOG, suppose $A\subset B$ . Since $$\overline{A}=A\cup A'$$ where $A'$ is the set of all limit points of $A$ , $C$ must contain a limit point $l$ of $A$ . But then, since $C$ is open, $C$ is a neighborhood of $l$ that doesn't intersect $A$ ; which makes $l$ not a limit point of $A$ . A contradiction. So $A\not\subset B$ and by the same process, $A\not \subset C$ . Hence $$A=(A\cap B)\cup(A\cap C)$$ separated by two non-empty clopen (in $A$ ) sets, thus $A$ is not connected. So we have the contrapositive statement "" $\overline{A}$ not connected $\implies$ $A$ not connected"", which proves "" $A$ connected $\implies$ $\overline{A}$ connected"". 2. Is $A^{\circ}$ connected? My answer is no. Consider $$A=\{(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2:x^2+y^2\leq 1\}\cup\{(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^2:(x-2)^2+y^2\leq 1\}$$ two circles tangent to each other at $(1,0)$ .

Previously I've computed $H_*(S^3-h(M))$ , where $M$ is the Möbius strip, which is $\mathbb{Z}$ for $*=0,1$ and $0$ otherwise, and I also have that the homomorphism $i_*:H_1(S^3-h(M))\to H_1(S^3-h(\partial M))$ induced by inclusion is multiplication by $2$ My work Now, I know that $\mathbb{R}P^2=M\cup int D^2$ , so I can write $S^3-M=(S^3-\mathbb{R}P^2)\cup intD^2$ . I have $(S^3-\mathbb{R}P^2)\cap intD^2=\emptyset$ . This set theoretic relation is preserved by $h$ , so the Mayer-Vietoris sequence tells me immediately that $H_i(S^3-h(\mathbb{R}P^2))=0$ for $i\geq 2$ . For $i=1$ it is also easy since we have $0\to H_1(S^3-h(\mathbb{R}P^2))\oplus H_1(h(intD^2))\to H_1(S^3-h(M))\to 0$ Since $h(int D^2)$ is contractible, we get $H_1(S^3-h(\mathbb{R}P^2))\cong H_1(S^3-h(M))=\mathbb{Z}$ . Similarly, for $i=0$ $0\to H_0(S^3-h(\mathbb{R}P^2))\oplus H_0(h(intD^2))\to H_0(S^3-h(M))\to 0$ Since both $h(intD^2)$ and $S^3-h(M)$ are path connected, this forces $H_0(S^3-h(\mathbb{R}P^2))=0$ . The contradiction now is that this means that $S^3-\mathbb{R}P^2$ has no path-connected components so it must be empty. This implies $S^3=h(\mathbb{R}P^2)$ , which is not possible since $S^3$ is not homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}P^2$ . Question Is everything okay? I'm unsure whether there is a step where I missed something, especially the contradiction part. I didn't use $i_*$ , so if there is an alternative proof using it I'll appreciate it.","I want to deduce that the projective plane cannot be embedded in using homology.
