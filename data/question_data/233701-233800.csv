My professor says there is an error in my logic (which I'll identify later) but I respectfully disagree and am looking for a second opinion. I'm asked to consider the following set $A$ and prove that $|A|=|\Bbb Q|$. $$A=\{S\subseteq \Bbb Q:\;\text{S is finite}\}$$ To show that $|A|\ge|\Bbb Q|$, I said consider the following subset $B$ of $A$: $$B=\{S\subseteq \Bbb Q: |S|=1\}$$ The set $B$ consists of elements which are sets of cardinality $1$. This means $\forall\;x\in \Bbb Q$, $\{x\}\in B$. Since $B\subseteq A$, $|A|\ge|\Bbb Q|$. She gave credit for this part, but the next was where we disagreed. To show $|A|\not>|\Bbb Q|$, I offered the following: Consider a finite subset of $\Bbb Q$ with cardinality $\le n$. This subset is comparable to an ordered pair in $\Bbb Q^n$. E.g. if $n=4$, we have the following: $$\{a,b,c,d\}\text{ is comparable to } (a,b,c,d) \text{ in }\Bbb Q^4$$ For subsets of cardinality $p$ less than four, I said one could simply repeat the last entry $n-p$ times since sets require unique elements but ordered pairs do not. $$\{a,b\}\text{ is comparable to }(a,b,b,b)\text{ in }\Bbb Q^4$$ In each case , the ordered pair in $\Bbb Q^n$ is unique, implying injectivity. Thus, my solution simply found an injection from $A$ to $\Bbb Q^n$ and utilised the fact that the Cartesian product of countable sets is countable to show that $|A|\le|\Bbb Q|\implies|A|=|\Bbb Q|$. However, my professor claimed that this does not necessarily hold for sufficiently large $n$. She compared my work to the false proof that the sum of naturals is finite because each time you add the next natural to the previous sum, you're adding a finite number to a finite sum. I disagree because no matter how large $n$, this is still comparable to $\Bbb Q^n$.

Here is my attempt at a proof: Let $S$ = {$ (a_0, a_1, ..., a_k)$ | $a_i\in \Bbb Z$, $k \in \Bbb N$} $T$ is the set in question. That is, $T$ = {$ (a_0, a_1x, ..., a_kx^{k})$ | $a_i \in \Bbb Z$, $k \in \Bbb N$}. Then by the enumeration principle $S$ is countable, i.e., |$S$| = |$\Bbb N$|, because it can be labelled by $L =$ {$0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, , , (, )$} [Note: I've included "","" as an element]. Now define an injection $f: T \to S$ by: $f(a_0 + a_1x + ... +a_kx^{k}$) = ($a_0, a_1, ..., a_k$). Then $|T| \le |S|$. We can define a similar injection $g: S \to T$, establishing |$S| \le |T$|. So |$T$| = |$S$| = |$\Bbb N$| which is what we wanted to prove. Is this good? I'm pretty new to set theory so I want to make sure these proofs are valid.",,['elementary-set-theory']

Sufficiency First, we show that, if $I \cap J \neq \emptyset$, then $I \cup J$ is an interval. Let $x, y \in I \cup J$ and $z \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $x \leqslant z \leqslant y$, and let $t$ be an arbitrary element of $I \cap J$. We consider three cases, in order to show that $z \in I \cup J$: If $z = t$, then $z \in I \cap J \subseteq I \cup J$. If $z > t$, then $t < z \leqslant y$. Therefore, if $y \in I$, then $z \in I$, because $t, y \in I$ and $I$ is an interval; if $y \in J$, then $z \in J$, because $t, y \in J$ and $J$ is an interval. Hence, $z \in I \cup J$. If $z < t$, then $x \leqslant z < t$. Therefore, if $x \in I$, then $z \in I$, because $t, x \in I$ and $I$ is an interval; if $x \in J$, then $z \in J$, because $t, x \in J$ and $J$ is an interval. Hence, $z \in I \cup J$. Next, we show that, if the second condition holds, then $I \cup J$ is an interval. Call $a$ the least upper bound of $I$, which is equal to the greatest lower bound of $J$ (by hypothesis). Let $x, y \in I \cup J$ and $z \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $x \leqslant z \leqslant y$. We consider three cases, in order to show that $z \in I \cup J$: If $z = a$, then $z \in I \cup J$ by hypothesis. If $z < a$, then $x \in I$, because $x \leqslant z < a$, while $n \geqslant a\ \forall \, n \in J$. By definition of least upper bound, there exists $u \in I$ such that $u > z$. Therefore, we have $x \leqslant z < u$, and $z \in I$ because $I$ is an interval. Hence, $z \in I \cup J$. If $z > a$, then $y \in J$, because $a < z \leqslant y$, while $m \leqslant a\ \forall \, m \in I$. By definition of greatest lower bound, there exists $v \in J$ such that $v < z$. Therefore, we have $v < z \leqslant y$, and $z \in J$ because $J$ is an interval. Hence, $z \in I \cup J$. Necessity Suppose $I \cap J = \emptyset$. We show by contradiction that the second condition holds. Suppose $\inf J < \sup I$. If $\inf J = \sup J$, then $J$ consists of only one point. It follows from the definition of interval that $I \supseteq\ ]\inf I, \sup I[$. So, it would be $J \subseteq I$, which is absurd (because $I \cap J = \emptyset$). Therefore, $\inf J < \sup J$. Call $m$ the minimum of $\sup I$ and $\sup J$. We have \begin{equation*} \inf I \leqslant \inf J < \frac{1}{2} (\inf J + m) < m. \end{equation*} Since $I \supseteq\ ]\inf I, \sup I[$ and $J \supseteq\ ]\inf J, \sup J[$ (this follows from the definition of interval), we have $\frac{1}{2} (\inf J + m) \in I \cap J$, which is absurd. Suppose $\sup I < \inf J$. Let $x$ be an arbitrary element of $I$, $y$ an arbitrary element of $J$ and $z := \frac{1}{2}(\sup I + \inf J)$. Then we have \begin{equation*} x \leqslant \sup I < z < \inf J \leqslant y. \end{equation*} $I \cup J$ is an interval, so $z \in I \cup J$, which is absurd because $z \notin I$ (since $z > \sup I$) and $z \notin J$ (since $z < \inf J$). Therefore, $\sup I = \inf J$. Call it $a$. We observe that $a \in \mathbb{R}$, otherwise it would be $a = +\infty$ and $J \subseteq I$, which is absurd. Finally, we show that $a \in I \cup J$. Let $x$ be an arbitrary element of $I$ and $y$ an arbitrary element of $J$. Then we have \begin{equation*} x \leqslant a \leqslant y. \end{equation*} Therefore, $a \in I \cup J$, because $I \cup J$ is an interval. Is this proof correct? If it is, can it be improved? Are there other proofs of this fact?","I am trying to write down a proof of the following fact: Let $I$ and $J$ be non-empty intervals of $\mathbb{R}$ such that $\inf I \leqslant \inf J$. The union $I \cup J$ is an interval if and only if one of the following conditions holds: $I \cap J \neq \emptyset$; $\sup I = \inf J$, and $\sup I = \inf J \in I \cup J$.
