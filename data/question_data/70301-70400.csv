2,Is the lower limit topology finer than the standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$?,Is the lower limit topology finer than the standard topology on ?,\mathbb{R},"Is the lower limit topology finer than the standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$? In Lemma 13.4 on p.82 of Munkres' Topology (2 nd ed.), it is stated that the lower limit topology is (strictly) finer than the standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$. In the argument, he is using that the interval $[a,b)$ lies in the interval $(a,b)$ which is certainly not true. On the other hand, the converse is true, that is: $$(a,b) \text{  lies in the interval } [a,b).$$ So we can conclude that the standard topology is finer than the lower limit topology. Am I right? If not then why? I think it's an errata. I have checked some existing errata online but it's not included, though.","Is the lower limit topology finer than the standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$?

I am aware that the product topology is the product in category while the disjoint union topology is the coproduct. Unfortunately I feel that doesn't quite explain it. If we let $(\mathbf{A},\alpha)$ and $(\mathbf{B},\beta)$ be two given topologies. I understand that our product topology for $\mathbf{A}\times\mathbf{B}$ is that a set $(u,v)$ is open in it if and only if $u$ is open in $\mathbf{A}$ and $v$ is open in $\mathbf{B}$. So far so good, this is all crystal clear to me. I will use the $\oplus$ symbol rather than the upside-down product sign, I don't like it. Let our disjoint union $\mathbf{A}\oplus\mathbf{B}$, a set for us here is then $u\oplus v$ and this is where I am starting to feel uncertain. I get there is a very evident inclusion map $\imath_A:\mathbf{A}\to\mathbf{A}\oplus\mathbf{B}$ which would be $\imath_A(a)=a\oplus\emptyset$, or more I deduce this from the context of what I am reading that this is the most likely candidate. I also gather from what I have read (I will inform I have not found it in a proper book in my studies so far, might have missed it but I have read this primarely online from definitions) that a set $u\oplus v$ is open if and only if $\imath_A^{-1}(u\oplus v)$ and $\imath_B^{-1}(u\oplus v)$ are open. This doesn't strike me as really that different, or different at all, from the product topology at first sight. I will speculate a bit here so please tell me what I get right and what I get wrong. I know the product topology is the cartesian product hence no part of the pair $(a,b)$ can be empty, the empty set is of course always part in the topology by definition. What I gather from my reading though is that they often place emphasis on the word ""or"", as in for $w\in\mathbf{A}\oplus\mathbf{B}$ we have that either $w\in\mathbf{A}$ OR $w\in\mathbf{B}$. This leads me to conclude that if we have $a\oplus b\in\mathbf{A}\oplus\mathbf{B}$ then either $a=\emptyset$ or we have that $b=\emptyset$. In a more word friendly way, that any element in our disjoint union topology is a member of either of the components that makes up the union, and not a construct as a combination from both of the components, which it is in a proudct topology.

I understand that our product topology for $\mathbf{A}\times\mathbf{B}$ is that a set $(u,v)$ is open in it if and only if $u$ is open in $\mathbf{A}$ and $v$ is open in $\mathbf{B}$. So far so good, this is all crystal clear to me. I will use the $\oplus$ symbol rather than the upside-down product sign, I don't like it. Let our disjoint union $\mathbf{A}\oplus\mathbf{B}$, a set for us here is then $u\oplus v$ and this is where I am starting to feel uncertain. I get there is a very evident inclusion map $\imath_A:\mathbf{A}\to\mathbf{A}\oplus\mathbf{B}$ which would be $\imath_A(a)=a\oplus\emptyset$, or more I deduce this from the context of what I am reading that this is the most likely candidate. I also gather from what I have read (I will inform I have not found it in a proper book in my studies so far, might have missed it but I have read this primarely online from definitions) that a set $u\oplus v$ is open if and only if $\imath_A^{-1}(u\oplus v)$ and $\imath_B^{-1}(u\oplus v)$ are open. This doesn't strike me as really that different, or different at all, from the product topology at first sight. I will speculate a bit here so please tell me what I get right and what I get wrong. I know the product topology is the cartesian product hence no part of the pair $(a,b)$ can be empty, the empty set is of course always part in the topology by definition. What I gather from my reading though is that they often place emphasis on the word ""or"", as in for $w\in\mathbf{A}\oplus\mathbf{B}$ we have that either $w\in\mathbf{A}$ OR $w\in\mathbf{B}$. This leads me to conclude that if we have $a\oplus b\in\mathbf{A}\oplus\mathbf{B}$ then either $a=\emptyset$ or we have that $b=\emptyset$. In a more word friendly way, that any element in our disjoint union topology is a member of either of the components that makes up the union, and not a construct as a combination from both of the components, which it is in a proudct topology. Am I understanding this correctly or am I missing something?",,['general-topology']

84,When is the Zariski topology $T_2$?,When is the Zariski topology ?,T_2,"In my general topology course, our instructor introduced the Zariski topology as a topology on $F^n$, where $F$ is a field, as the topology $\tau$ generated by the basis $\mathcal{B} = \{ f^{-1} (F \setminus \{ 0 \}) : f \in F[x_1 , \ldots, x_n] \}$, or equivalently generated by closed sets which are the pre-image of $\{ 0 \}$ under some $n$-variate polynomial in $F$. For $F$ infinite, $n = 1$, we can note that $F$ is given the cofinite topology, which is not $T_2$. Now for $\mathbb{R}^{n}, n \geq 2$, the Zariski topology must necessarily be $T_1$ and not $T_2$ (a prescribed exercise). The former can be seen via the equivalent definition of $T_1$ as leaving all singletons closed (consider merely a linear polynomial). The not Hausdorff part, however, comes from observing that the pre-image of $\{ 0 \}$ under an $n$-variate non-constant polynomial can have dimension at most $n - 1$, so the open sets have too great a codimension for the topology to be Hausdorff, where the dimension is taken in the sense of Hausdorff (though I think the implicit function theorem would let us instead say simply that it's a manifold of dimension $< n$). Similar justifications hold for $\mathbb{C}$. However, in these cases we're appealing to properties of $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{C}$ beyond merely algebraic properties, but geometric properties of the two; in particular we're considering properties of $\mathbb{R} ^ n , \mathbb{C} ^ n$ as Banach spaces, an object that doesn't even make sense except in terms of subfields of $\mathbb{C}$. Alternatively, for finite fields $F = \mathbb{F}_{p^{k}}^{n}$, we can again show the topology is discrete, again by counting methods. So the problem of discerning when $F^{n}$ is $T_2$ is simple for $n = 1$, coming down to cardinality arguments about $F$. Moreover, the problem is simple for finite $F$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. The problem is also resolvable for $F = \mathbb{R}$ or $F = \mathbb{C}$, but these cases must be addressed by geometric methods, referring to relations between $\mathbb{R}[x_1 , \ldots, x_n]$ (resp. $\mathbb{C} [x_1 , \ldots, x_n ]$) and the thoroughly studied geometric properties of $\mathbb{R}$ (resp. $\mathbb{C}$). But when I broached to my professor the question of how me might address the Zariski topology on, say, $\mathbb{Q}^2$, he said he'd leave the question to me, as it was beyond his area of knowledge. So I took it to the MSE community. How would we go about discerning whether the Zariski topology on $F^n$ is $T_2$ for arbitrary fields $F$, where $n \geq 2, |F| = \infty$? My attempts thus far What I've figured out is that $X$ is $T_2$ iff for every $x_1 , x_2 \in X, x_1 \neq x_2$, there exist closed $K_1, K_2$ such that $x_1 \in K_1 \setminus K_2, x_2 \in K_2 \setminus K_1, K_1 \cup K_2 = X$. My argument is as follows: $(\Rightarrow)$ If $X$ is $T_2$, then there exist open $U_1, U_2$ such that $x_1 \in U_1, x_2 \in U_2, U_1 \cap U_2 = \emptyset$. Let $K_1 = U_2^{\complement}, K_2 = U_1^{\complement}$. Then $x_1 \in K_1, x_2 \in K_2$. Moreover, $K_1 \cup K_2 = U_1^{\complement} \cup U_2^{\complement} = (U_1 \cap U_2)^{\complement} = X$. $(\Leftarrow)$ Let $x_1 \in K_1 \setminus K_2, x_2 \in K_2 \setminus K_1$, and let $U_1 = K_2^{\complement}, U_2 = K_1^{\complement}$. Then $x_1 \in U_1, x_2 \in U_2$, and $U_1 \cap U_2 = \left( K_1^{\complement} \cup K_2^{\complement} \right) ^{\complement} = \emptyset$. This completes the proof (hopefully). This means that I wanna be able for arbitrary point $\mathbf{x} = (x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}), \mathbf{y} = (y_1 , \ldots, y_n ) \in F^n, \mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{y}$, find polynomials $f, g \in F[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ such that $f(\mathbf{x}) = 0 \neq f( \mathbf{y}), g(\mathbf{y}) = 0 \neq g(\mathbf{x})$, and $f^{-1}(\{0\}) \cup g^{-1}(\{0\}) = F^n$. Then $fg \equiv 0$. I feel as if there is a short line to add here to conclude that no such $f, g$ exist, but I don't know what it is.

Now for $\mathbb{R}^{n}, n \geq 2$, the Zariski topology must necessarily be $T_1$ and not $T_2$ (a prescribed exercise). The former can be seen via the equivalent definition of $T_1$ as leaving all singletons closed (consider merely a linear polynomial). The not Hausdorff part, however, comes from observing that the pre-image of $\{ 0 \}$ under an $n$-variate non-constant polynomial can have dimension at most $n - 1$, so the open sets have too great a codimension for the topology to be Hausdorff, where the dimension is taken in the sense of Hausdorff (though I think the implicit function theorem would let us instead say simply that it's a manifold of dimension $< n$). Similar justifications hold for $\mathbb{C}$. However, in these cases we're appealing to properties of $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{C}$ beyond merely algebraic properties, but geometric properties of the two; in particular we're considering properties of $\mathbb{R} ^ n , \mathbb{C} ^ n$ as Banach spaces, an object that doesn't even make sense except in terms of subfields of $\mathbb{C}$. Alternatively, for finite fields $F = \mathbb{F}_{p^{k}}^{n}$, we can again show the topology is discrete, again by counting methods. So the problem of discerning when $F^{n}$ is $T_2$ is simple for $n = 1$, coming down to cardinality arguments about $F$. Moreover, the problem is simple for finite $F$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. The problem is also resolvable for $F = \mathbb{R}$ or $F = \mathbb{C}$, but these cases must be addressed by geometric methods, referring to relations between $\mathbb{R}[x_1 , \ldots, x_n]$ (resp. $\mathbb{C} [x_1 , \ldots, x_n ]$) and the thoroughly studied geometric properties of $\mathbb{R}$ (resp. $\mathbb{C}$). But when I broached to my professor the question of how me might address the Zariski topology on, say, $\mathbb{Q}^2$, he said he'd leave the question to me, as it was beyond his area of knowledge. So I took it to the MSE community. How would we go about discerning whether the Zariski topology on $F^n$ is $T_2$ for arbitrary fields $F$, where $n \geq 2, |F| = \infty$? My attempts thus far What I've figured out is that $X$ is $T_2$ iff for every $x_1 , x_2 \in X, x_1 \neq x_2$, there exist closed $K_1, K_2$ such that $x_1 \in K_1 \setminus K_2, x_2 \in K_2 \setminus K_1, K_1 \cup K_2 = X$. My argument is as follows: $(\Rightarrow)$ If $X$ is $T_2$, then there exist open $U_1, U_2$ such that $x_1 \in U_1, x_2 \in U_2, U_1 \cap U_2 = \emptyset$. Let $K_1 = U_2^{\complement}, K_2 = U_1^{\complement}$. Then $x_1 \in K_1, x_2 \in K_2$. Moreover, $K_1 \cup K_2 = U_1^{\complement} \cup U_2^{\complement} = (U_1 \cap U_2)^{\complement} = X$. $(\Leftarrow)$ Let $x_1 \in K_1 \setminus K_2, x_2 \in K_2 \setminus K_1$, and let $U_1 = K_2^{\complement}, U_2 = K_1^{\complement}$. Then $x_1 \in U_1, x_2 \in U_2$, and $U_1 \cap U_2 = \left( K_1^{\complement} \cup K_2^{\complement} \right) ^{\complement} = \emptyset$. This completes the proof (hopefully). This means that I wanna be able for arbitrary point $\mathbf{x} = (x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}), \mathbf{y} = (y_1 , \ldots, y_n ) \in F^n, \mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{y}$, find polynomials $f, g \in F[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ such that $f(\mathbf{x}) = 0 \neq f( \mathbf{y}), g(\mathbf{y}) = 0 \neq g(\mathbf{x})$, and $f^{-1}(\{0\}) \cup g^{-1}(\{0\}) = F^n$. Then $fg \equiv 0$. I feel as if there is a short line to add here to conclude that no such $f, g$ exist, but I don't know what it is.

Partially order $\mathcal{X}$ by $(U,s) \preceq (U_1,s_1)$ if $U \subseteq U_1$ and $s_1 \mid U = s$. It is routine to see that chains in $\mathcal{X}$ have upper bounds, and so Zorn's Lemma provides a maximal element $(U_0,s_0)$. If $U_0=X$, then $s_0$ is a global section and $\varphi_X$ is epic. Otherwise, choose $x \in X$ with $x \notin U_0 $. Since $\varphi:\mathcal{F} \rightarrow \mathcal{F}''$ is an epic sheaf map, it is epic on stalks, and so there are an open $V \subseteq X$ with $V \ni x$ and a section $t \in \mathcal{F}(V)$ with $\varphi t = s'' \mid V$. Now $s - t \in \mathcal{F}'(U \cap V)$ (we regard $\iota: \mathcal{F}' \rightarrow \mathcal{F}$ as the inclusion), so that $\mathcal{F}'$ flabby provides $r \in \mathcal{F}'(X)$ extending $s - t$. Hence, $s = t + r \mid (U \cap V)$ in $\mathcal{F}(U \cap V)$. Therefore, these sections may be glued: there is $\tilde{s} \in \mathcal{F}(U \cup V)$ with $\tilde{s} \mid U = s$ and $\tilde{s} \mid V = t + r \mid (U \cap V)$.

Hence, $s = t + r \mid (U \cap V)$ in $\mathcal{F}(U \cap V)$. Therefore, these sections may be glued: there is $\tilde{s} \in \mathcal{F}(U \cup V)$ with $\tilde{s} \mid U = s$ and $\tilde{s} \mid V = t + r \mid (U \cap V)$. But $\varphi(\tilde{s}) = s''$, and this contradicts the maximality of $(U_0,s_0)$. MY QUESTIONS ARE: 1 - Why does it say that 'it is ENOUGH to prove that $\varphi_X$ is epic'? 2 - Why does it say 'If $U_0 = X$, then $s_0$ is a global section and $\varphi_X$ is epic'? Why is $\varphi_X$ epic if $s_0$ is global? 3 - I got stuck there so the rest of the proof I'm basically in La La land too",,"['general-topology', 'homological-algebra', 'sheaf-theory']"
