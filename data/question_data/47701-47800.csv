I assume the random distribution is uniform, such that the probability each point is within a given measurable subset of the sphere is proportional to the spherical area of that subset. First, given triangle vertices $A,B,C$ on the unit sphere, we can rotate and/or mirror the coordinate system so that $C = (0,0,1)$ , $A$ is on the $x \geq 0, y=0$ half-plane, and $B$ is on the $y \geq 0$ hemisphere. Label the side lengths opposite $A$ , $B$ , and $C$ as $a$ , $b$ , and $c$ respectively. Label the (dihedral) angles at $A$ , $B$ , and $C$ as $\alpha$ , $\beta$ , and $\gamma$ respectively. Ignore a degenerate triangle case with any of these variables exactly equal to $0$ or $\pi$ ; this happens with probability zero. Then all six variables are in the interval $\{a,b,c,\alpha,\beta,\gamma\} \subset (0,\pi)$ . We can parameterize the probability distribution as: $$ \begin{align*}  P(a < a_0) &= \frac{1-\cos a_0}{2} \\  P(b < b_0) &= \frac{1-\cos b_0}{2} \\  P(\gamma < \gamma_0) &= \frac{\gamma_0}{\pi} \end{align*}$$ Variables $a$ , $b$ , and $\gamma$ are independent, so the overall probability density function is $$ dP = \frac{1}{4\pi} \sin a \sin b\, da\, db\, d\gamma $$ The spherical area $\sigma$ of the triangle is $$ \sigma = \alpha + \beta + \gamma - \pi $$ The outcome $\sigma > \pi$ is only possible if $\gamma > \frac{\pi}{2}$ , since the spherical triangle covers a subset of the region between the planes containing $\{O,A,C\}$ and $\{O,A,B\}$ with area, $2 \gamma$ . Similarly $\sigma > \pi$ implies $\alpha > \frac{\pi}{2}$ and $\beta > \frac{\pi}{2}$ . We also have Napier's analogy $$ \tan \frac{\alpha+\beta}{2} = \frac{\cos \frac{a-b}{2}}{\cos \frac{a+b}{2}} \cot \frac{\gamma}{2} $$ Since $\{a,b\} \subset (0, \pi)$ , $|a-b|<\pi$ and $\cos \frac{a-b}{2} > 0$ . If $\sigma > \pi$ then $\{\alpha, \beta, \gamma\} \subset (\frac{\pi}{2}, \pi)$ which implies $\tan \frac{\alpha+\beta}{2} < 0$ and $\cot \frac{\gamma}{2} > 0$ . Therefore $\cos \frac{a+b}{2} < 0$ , and $\frac{a+b}{2} > \frac{\pi}{2}$ . So given $\{\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \frac{a+b}{2}\} \subset (\frac{\pi}{2}, \pi)$ , all these inequalities are equivalent: $$ \begin{align*} \sigma &> \pi \\  \alpha + \beta + \gamma &> 2\pi \\  \pi - \frac{\gamma}{2} &< \frac{\alpha+\beta}{2} \\  \tan \left(\pi - \frac{\gamma}{2}\right) &< \tan \frac{\alpha+\beta}{2} \\  -\tan \frac{\gamma}{2} &< \frac{\cos \frac{a-b}{2}}{\cos \frac{a+b}{2}} \cot \frac{\gamma}{2} \\ \tan^2 \frac{\gamma}{2} &> - \cos \frac{a-b}{2}\, \sec \frac{a+b}{2} \\ \gamma &> 2\tan^{-1} \sqrt{- \cos \frac{a-b}{2}\, \sec \frac{a+b}{2}} = \gamma_L(a,b) \end{align*}$$ where the function $\gamma_L(a,b)$ is defined where $0 \leq a \leq \pi$ , $0 \leq b \leq \pi$ , and $a+b>\pi$ . The probability in question is \begin{align}P(\sigma > \pi) &= \int_0^\pi \int_{\pi-a}^\pi \int_{\gamma_L(a,b)}^\pi \frac{1}{4\pi} \sin a \sin b\, d\gamma\, db\, da\\&= \frac{1}{4\pi} \int_0^\pi \int_{\pi-a}^\pi [\pi - \gamma_L(a,b)] \sin a \sin b\, db\, da\end{align} I've found we can also write $$ \gamma_L(a,b) = \pi - \cos^{-1}\left(\cot \frac{a}{2} \cot \frac{b}{2}\right) $$ Either way, integration by parts can get rid of the inverse trig function in the integrand, leaving a square root, but I haven't been able to make much progress beyond that in solving the definite integral.

The residue at $w = z$ is found to be $$2 \exp\bigg(\dfrac{\lambda}{4}\bigg(z + \dfrac{1}{z}\bigg)\bigg) $$ whereas to evaluate the residues at $w = 0$ , we need to expand the exponential as a power series and keep only all those terms which possess a simple pole at $w=0$ .

I have calculated the analytical solution for the integral in terms of the digammas $\psi(z)$ functions (see derivation below), but when comparing the derived expression with the numerical solution using the quadrature method from the scipy routine in python for the set of parameters $x_{0}=\mu=0,\gamma= T=1$ and $\Psi\in[-2,2]$ there is an evident discrepancy between both approaches, plot at the end. I suspect that my analytical derivation is not completely correct, although when I set $\Psi=0$ the agreement between both approaches is perfect. Can anybody help me to understand where I'm wrong? The required integral is derived after an auxiliary integral $\mathcal{I}_1$ (correctly checked). Problems may start from $\mathcal{I}_2$ . \begin{align} \mathcal{I}_1=\int\limits_{-\infty}^\infty f_T(x-\mu)\frac{\gamma}{(x-x_{0})^{2}+\frac{\gamma^{2}}{4}}dx \end{align} Using the substitution $x = \mu + T u$ and the abbreviations $u_0 = \frac{x_0 - \mu}{T}$ and $\beta = \frac{\gamma}{2T}$ , we can write the integral as \begin{align} \mathcal{I}_{1} = 2 \beta \int \limits_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{\mathrm{d} u}{(\mathrm{e}^{u} + 1)[(u-u_0)^2 + \beta^2]}  \equiv 2 \beta \int \limits_{-\infty}^\infty g_{\beta,u_0}(u) \, \mathrm{d} u \, .   \end{align} $g_{\beta,u_0}$ has simple poles at $u_0 \pm \mathrm{i} \beta$ with residues \begin{align}  \operatorname{Res}(g_{\beta,u_0},u_0 \pm \mathrm{i} \beta) = \pm \frac{1}{2 \mathrm{i} \beta (\mathrm{e}^{u_0 \pm \mathrm{i} \beta} + 1)}  \end{align} and at $\pm (2n+1) \pi \mathrm{i}$ (so only at the odd-integer multiples of $\pi \mathrm{i}$ !) with residues \begin{align}  \operatorname{Res}(g_{\beta,u_0},\pm (2n+1) \pi \mathrm{i}) = - \frac{1}{[(2n+1) \pi \mathrm{i} \mp u_0]^2 + \beta^2}  \end{align} for $n \in \mathbb{N}_0$ . The integrals of $g_{\beta,u_0}$ along semi-circles (avoiding the poles on the imaginary axis) vanish in the limit of large radii, so we can use the residue theorem to evaluate the integral. Closing the contour in the upper half-plane (the lower half-plane works just as well) yields \begin{align} \mathcal{I}_{1} =& 2 \beta \, 2 \pi \mathrm{i} \left[\operatorname{Res}(g_{\beta,u_0},u_0 + \mathrm{i} \beta) + \sum \limits_{n=0}^\infty \operatorname{Res}(g_{\beta,u_0},(2n+1) \pi \mathrm{i}) \right] \\ =&4 \pi \beta\mathrm{i} \left[ \frac{1}{2 \mathrm{i} \beta (\mathrm{e}^{u_0 + \mathrm{i} \beta} + 1)}- \sum \limits_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{[(2n+1) \pi \mathrm{i} - u_0]^2 + \beta^2} \right]\\ =&4 \pi \beta\mathrm{i} \left[ \frac{1}{2 \mathrm{i} \beta (\mathrm{e}^{u_0 + \mathrm{i} \beta} + 1)}+ \sum \limits_{n=0}^\infty\frac{\frac{1}{4\pi\beta}}{\left(n+\left[\frac{1}{2}+\frac{\mathrm{i}u_0+\beta}{2\pi}\right]\right)}-\sum \limits_{n=0}^\infty\frac{\frac{1}{4\pi\beta}}{\left(n+\left[\frac{1}{2}+\frac{\mathrm{i}u_0-\beta}{2\pi}\right]\right)} \right] \end{align} Now we use the series formula for the digamma function $\psi$ \begin{align} \psi(z)=\sum \limits_{n=0}^\infty\left(\frac{1}{n+1}-\frac{1}{n+z}\right)-\gamma \end{align} to find \begin{align} \mathcal{I} = 2 \pi \left[\frac{1}{\mathrm{e}^{u_0 + \mathrm{i} \beta} + 1} - \frac{1}{2 \pi \mathrm{i}} \left(\psi \left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\beta + \mathrm{i} u_0}{2 \pi}\right) - \psi \left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{-\beta + \mathrm{i} u_0}{2 \pi}\right) \right)\right]\end{align} Finally, we apply the reflection formula \begin{align} \psi(1-z)=\psi(z)+\pi\cot{\left(\pi z\right)} \end{align} to the second digamma function together with the properties \begin{gather}  \operatorname{Im} \left[\psi(x+ \mathrm{i}y)\right]=\frac{ \mathrm{i}}{2}\left(\psi(x- \mathrm{i}y)-\psi(x+ \mathrm{i}y)\right)\\   \cot{\left(\frac{\pi}{2}+z\right)}=-\tan(z)\\  \frac{1}{e^{z}+1}+\frac{\mathrm{i}}{2}\tan\left(\frac{-\mathrm{i}z}{2}\right)=\frac{1}{2} \end{gather} and simplify the result: \begin{align} \mathcal{I}&=  2 \pi \left[\frac{1}{\mathrm{e}^{u_0 + \mathrm{i} \beta} + 1} - \frac{1}{2 \mathrm{i}} \tan\left(\frac{\beta - \mathrm{i} u_0}{2}\right) -\frac{1}{2 \pi \mathrm{i}} \left(\psi \left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\beta + \mathrm{i} u_0}{2 \pi}\right) - \psi \left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\beta - \mathrm{i} u_0}{2 \pi}\right) \right)\right] \\ &= 2 \pi \left[\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{\pi} \operatorname{Im} \left(\psi \left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\beta + \mathrm{i} u_0}{2 \pi}\right) \right) \right] = \pi - 2 \operatorname{Im} \left[\psi \left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\beta + \mathrm{i} u_0}{2 \pi}\right) \right] \, . \end{align} Returning to the original parameters, we end up with \begin{align} \boxed{\mathcal{I}_{1}(\gamma,x_{0}, \mu,T) =\int \limits_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{1}{\mathrm{e}^{(x - \mu)/T} + 1} \frac{\gamma}{(x-x_0)^2 + \gamma^2/4} \, \mathrm{d} x = \pi - 2 \operatorname{Im} \left[\psi \left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\frac{\gamma}{2} + \mathrm{i} (x_0 - \mu)}{2 \pi T}\right) \right] }\, . \end{align} Note that the dependence on the parameters is explicit and in the special case $x_0 = \mu$ the result is simply $\pi$ . This can also be shown using elementary methods, so the implicit assumption $u_0 + \mathrm{i} \beta \not\in (2 \mathbb{Z} + 1) \pi \mathrm{i}$ used in the computation of the residues is justified. The integral we are interested in is \begin{align} \mathcal{I}_2=\int\limits_{-\infty}^\infty \left(f_T(\frac{x-\mu}{1+\Psi/2})-f_T(\frac{x+\mu}{1-\Psi/2})\right)\frac{x\gamma}{(x-x_{0})^{2}+\frac{\gamma^{2}}{4}}dx \label{eq:2} \end{align} We can rewrite the integral $I_{2}$ decomposing the second factor as the sum of two complex parts. This is related to the advanced and retarded Green's functions \begin{align} \frac{x\gamma}{(x-x_{0})^{2}+\frac{\gamma^{2}}{4}}  = &\frac{\gamma}{2}\left[\frac{1}{x-\left(x_{0}+ \mathrm{i}\frac{\gamma}{2}\right)}+\frac{1}{x-\left(x_{0}- \mathrm{i}\frac{\gamma}{2}\right)}\right] - \mathrm{i}x_{0}\left[\frac{1}{x-\left(x_{0}+ \mathrm{i}\frac{\gamma}{2}\right)}-\frac{1}{x-\left(x_{0}- \mathrm{i}\frac{\gamma}{2}\right)}\right]\\ =&\frac{\gamma}{2}\left[G^{A}+G^{R}\right]- \mathrm{i}x_{0}\left[G^{A}-G^{R}\right] \end{align} On the other hand, we can rewrite the Cauchy distribution used in the previous integral as function of the Green's functions too and using that the second contribution is related to the previously calculated integral $\mathcal{I}_{1}$ \begin{align} \frac{\gamma}{(x-x_{0})^{2}+\frac{\gamma^{2}}{4}} =- \mathrm{i}\left[\frac{1}{x-\left(x_{0}+ \mathrm{i}\frac{\gamma}{2}\right)}-\frac{1}{x-\left(x_{0}- \mathrm{i}\frac{\gamma}{2}\right)}\right] =- \mathrm{i}\left[G^{A}-G^{R}\right]. \end{align} So \begin{align} \mathcal{I}_2=&\frac{\gamma}{2}\int\limits_{-\infty}^\infty \left(f_T(\frac{x-\mu}{1+\Psi/2})-f_T(\frac{x+\mu}{1-\Psi/2})\right)\left[\frac{1}{x-\left(x_{0}+ \mathrm{i}\frac{\gamma}{2}\right)}+\frac{1}{x-\left(x_{0}- \mathrm{i}\frac{\gamma}{2}\right)}\right]dx\nonumber\\&+x_{0}\left(I_{1}\left(\gamma,x_{0}, \mu,T(1+\Psi/2)\right)-I_{1}(\gamma,x_{0}, -\mu,T(1-\Psi/2))\right)\\ =&\frac{\gamma}{2}\int\limits_{-\infty}^\infty f_T(z)\left[\left(\frac{1}{z-\frac{x_0-\mu+\mathrm{i}\frac{\gamma}{2}}{1+\Psi/2}}+\frac{1}{z-\frac{x_0-\mu-\mathrm{i}\frac{\gamma}{2}}{1+\Psi/2}}\right)-\left(\frac{1}{z-\frac{x_0+\mu+\mathrm{i}\frac{\gamma}{2}}{1-\Psi/2}}+\frac{1}{z-\frac{x_0+\mu-\mathrm{i}\frac{\gamma}{2}}{1-\Psi/2}}\right)\right]dz\nonumber\\&+x_{0}\left(\mathcal{I}_{1}\left(\gamma,x_{0}, \mu,T_L\right)-\mathcal{I}_{1}(\gamma,x_{0}, -\mu,T_R)\right) \end{align} Note that the integral $\mathcal{I}_2$ is convergent because the difference of the Fermi functions contributes asymptotically as $x^{-1}$ and the Green's function contributes another $x^{-1}$ .

ORIGINAL QUESTION: I want to solve the following integral with the Fermi function and and . I have calculated the analytical solution for the integral in terms of the digammas functions (see derivation below), but when comparing the derived expression with the numerical solution using the quadrature method from the scipy routine in python for the set of parameters and there is an evident discrepancy between both approaches, plot at the end. I suspect that my analytical derivation is not completely correct, although when I set the agreement between both approaches is perfect. Can anybody help me to understand where I'm wrong? The required integral is derived after an auxiliary integral (correctly checked). Problems may start from . Using the substitution and the abbreviations and , we can write the integral as has simple poles at with residues and at (so only at the odd-integer multiples of !) with residues for . The integrals of along semi-circles (avoiding the poles on the imaginary axis) vanish in the limit of large radii, so we can use the residue theorem to evaluate the integral. Closing the contour in the upper half-plane (the lower half-plane works just as well) yields Now we use the series formula for the digamma function to find Finally, we apply the reflection formula to the second digamma function together with the properties and simplify the result: Returning to the original parameters, we end up with Note that the dependence on the parameters is explicit and in the special case the result is simply . This can also be shown using elementary methods, so the implicit assumption used in the computation of the residues is justified. The integral we are interested in is We can rewrite the integral decomposing the second factor as the sum of two complex parts. This is related to the advanced and retarded Green's functions On the other hand, we can rewrite the Cauchy distribution used in the previous integral as function of the Green's functions too and using that the second contribution is related to the previously calculated integral So Note that the integral is convergent because the difference of the Fermi functions contributes asymptotically as and the Green's function contributes another . The integral of a single Green's function with a single Fermi function would be logarithmically divergent. In the second equality the Fermi functions arguments have been shifted to the Green's functions terms we can split the integral in two parts such that closing the integration contour in the upper half and using now the series relation for the Fermi function we have with . In the last step we have used for the second contribution So Finally So (The motivation is related to a quantum problem, but people downvoted previous question arguing that this is related to physics, so if somebody wants me to explain the physical interpretation of the parameters please do not hesitate.)","\begin{align}

62,Solution to diffusion/Smoluchowski equation using an inverse Laplace transform,Solution to diffusion/Smoluchowski equation using an inverse Laplace transform,,"I am studying a new formula that extracts solution to the diffusion-Smoluchowski equation and is rooted on the theory of complex calculus. Namely, the formula looks like \begin{equation} P(t) = \mathcal{N} \oint_{\text{Br}}  J \cfrac{{\rm e}^{\tfrac{Ht}{4D}} {\rm e}^{-\tfrac{2 \Delta V + 2 \int_{x_0}^{x_1} \sqrt{H + V'(x)^2} \mathop{dx}}{4D}}}{\sqrt{\sqrt{H+ V'(x_0)^2} \sqrt{H + V'(x_1)^2}}} \cfrac{\mathop{dH}}{4D}. \end{equation} where our $H$ is the Laplace parameter, $\mathcal{N}$ is a normalisation constant, $J$ is a Jacobian, $V(x)$ is the potential, $\Delta V = V(x_1) - V(x_0)$ and we are doing a Bromwich integral. I have done it for the zero potential and linear potential case. However, I am struggling with the quadratic case $V(x) = \tfrac{1}{2} x^2$ (Ornstein-Uhlenbech solution). It is analytically tractable for quadratic potentials but I would need two cuts and this is what is confusing me. I will show what I have done for the other cases, and then any guidance to extend this to quadratic potentials would help me out. For instance, consider when the potential is zero (typical diffusion with no mechanical forcing): At first, let’s take the potential $V(x) = 0$ , i.e.,\ assume there is no external force. In this case, one expects to recover the fundamental solution to the heat equation, and indeed we do. So, \begin{equation} P_{V = 0}(t) = \oint_{\text{Br}} \cfrac{{\rm e}^{\tfrac{Ht}{4D}} {\rm e}^{-\tfrac{2 \sqrt{H}(x_1 - x_0) }{4D}}}{4D\sqrt{H}}  \mathop{dH}. \end{equation} The normalisation constant is unity for this case. I approach solving this integral by using complex analysis and the theory of branch points. Let \begin{equation} \oint_{\Gamma} \cfrac{{\rm e}^{\tfrac{zt}{4D}} {\rm e}^{-\tfrac{2 \sqrt{z}(x_1 - x_0) }{4D}}}{4D\sqrt{z}}  \mathop{dz} = \oint_{\Gamma} f(z) \mathop{dz} \hspace{2mm} \text{where}  \hspace{2mm} f(z) = \cfrac{{\rm e}^{\tfrac{zt}{4D}} {\rm e}^{-\tfrac{2 \sqrt{z}(x_1 - x_0) }{4D}}}{4D\sqrt{z}}.  \end{equation} This has a branch point at $z = 0$ qnd I choose the branch cut to span to negative infinity (principle branch). We use the keyhole contour. It has 6 components. $\Gamma_1$ spans the imaginary axis and is shifted to the right of the point at zero. $\Gamma_2, \Gamma_4$ are semi-circles with radius $R$ , $\Gamma_4$ is a circle of radius $\epsilon$ about the branch point and $\Gamma_3, \Gamma_5$ are the lines just above/below the cut from $-\infty$ to 0 and $0$ to $-\infty$ respectively. It is straightforward to show that the arced segments contribute nothing to the overall integral in the limiting process $R \rightarrow \infty, \epsilon \rightarrow 0$ . The semicircular arcs vanish by Jordan’s lemma and then the contribution from $\Gamma_4$ vanishes by using the parameterisation $z = \epsilon \exp(i \theta)$ . By Cauchy's residue theorem, we know that \begin{equation} \left[\oint_{\Gamma_1} + \oint_{\Gamma_3} + \oint_{\Gamma_5} \right] f(z) \mathop{dz} = 0 \end{equation} since the branch point is excluded from the interior of the contour. The integral we want to compute is $\cfrac{1}{2 \pi i} \oint_{\Gamma_1} f(z) \mathop{dz}$ . On $\Gamma_3$ , let’s take $z = p {\rm e}^{i \pi} = - p$ . Then, $\mathop{dz} = - \mathop{dp}$ and $\sqrt{z} = i \sqrt{p}$ . Since the integral is from $- \infty$ to 0 on this segment, we have \begin{equation} \oint_{\Gamma_3} f = - \int_{\infty}^{0} \cfrac{{\rm e}^{-\tfrac{pt}{4D}} {\rm e}^{-\tfrac{i\sqrt{p}(x_1 - x_0) }{2D}}}{4Di\sqrt{p}}  \mathop{dp} = \int_{0}^{\infty} \cfrac{{\rm e}^{-\tfrac{pt}{4D}} {\rm e}^{-\tfrac{i\sqrt{p}(x_1 - x_0) }{2D}}}{4Di\sqrt{p}}  \mathop{dp}. \end{equation} Similarly, on $\Gamma_5$ lets follow a similar parameterisation and take $z = p {\rm e}^{- i \pi}$ . Note, the minus sign in the exponent represents moving below the branch cut along the line. Now, $\sqrt{z} = - i \sqrt{p}$ . Since the integral is from 0 to $- \infty$ on this segment, we have \begin{equation} \oint_{\Gamma_5} f = - \int_{0}^{\infty} \cfrac{{\rm e}^{-\tfrac{pt}{4D}} {\rm e}^{\tfrac{i\sqrt{p}(x_1 - x_0) }{2D}}}{-4Di\sqrt{p}}  \mathop{dp} = \int_{0}^{\infty} \cfrac{{\rm e}^{-\tfrac{pt}{4D}} \cdot {\rm e}^{\tfrac{i\sqrt{p}(x_1 - x_0) }{2D}}}{4Di\sqrt{p}}  \mathop{dp}. \end{equation} Hence, from Cauchy’s residue formula, we have that our inverse Laplace transform is given by \begin{equation} \cfrac{1}{2 \pi i} \oint_{\Gamma_1} f(z) \mathop{dz} = - \cfrac{1}{2 \pi i } \left[\oint_{\Gamma_3} + \oint_{\Gamma_5} \right] f(z) \mathop{dz}. \end{equation} From here, we can solve the integral explicitly. We shall use the substitution $p = u^2$ to transform our exponent into a quadratic, making it a Gaussian integral, enabling the use of the result \begin{equation} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp( - \alpha x^2) \mathop{dx} = \sqrt{\cfrac{\pi}{\alpha}}. \end{equation} So, \begin{align} \cfrac{1}{2 \pi i} \oint_{\gamma_1} f(z) \mathop{dz} & =   \cfrac{1}{ \pi }  \int_{0}^{\infty} \cfrac{{\rm e}^{- \tfrac{pt}{4D}}}{4D \sqrt{p}} \cos \left(\tfrac{\sqrt{p}}{2D} (x_1 - x_0) \right) \mathop{dp} \\ & = \cfrac{1}{\pi} \Re \left\{ \int_{0}^{\infty} \cfrac{{\rm e}^{- \tfrac{pt}{4D}}}{4D \sqrt{p}} \cdot {\rm e}^{\tfrac{i \sqrt{p}(x_1 - x_0)}{2D}}  \mathop{dp}\right\} \\ & = \cfrac{1}{4 \pi D} \Re \left\{ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} {\rm e}^{- \tfrac{u^2 t}{4D} + \tfrac{iu}{2D}(x_1-x_0)} du \right\} \\ & = \cfrac{1}{4 \pi D} \Re \left\{\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} {\rm e}^{-\tfrac{t}{4D}[(u - \tfrac{i}{t}(x_1 - x_0))^2 + \tfrac{1}{t^2}(x_1-x_0)^2]} \mathop{du} \right\} \\ & = \cfrac{1}{\sqrt{4 \pi D t}} {\rm e}^{- \tfrac{(x_1-x_0)^2}{4Dt}},  \end{align} which is exactly what we hoped. The case $V(x) = \alpha x$ follows very similarly. The case $V(x) = \tfrac{1}{2}x^2$ causes me some trouble. For simplicity, I think it is best if we take $x_0 = 0$ for now. In such a case, one has an $\operatorname{arcsinh}(x_1/\sqrt(z))$ term appearing from the integral, and the Jacobain (which gives a $\tfrac{1}{2} \operatorname{arsinh}$ factor) as well, and I do not know how to handle it and it becomes quite a formidable looking integral. In this case, the integral becomes \begin{equation} P(t) = \mathcal{N} \oint_{\text{Br}}  \cfrac{{\rm e}^{\tfrac{Ht}{4D}} {\rm e}^{-\tfrac{x_1^2 +  (H-2D) \operatorname{arcsinh}(x_1/\sqrt{H})+ x_1 \sqrt{H+ x_1^2}}{4D}}}{\sqrt{\sqrt{H} \sqrt{H + x_1^2}}} \cfrac{\mathop{dH}}{4D}. \end{equation} As a little comment, I am quite sure this is the right formula and what is fascinating is how the branch points of the nasty hyperbolic function align perfectly with the other exponent term and the denominators; this must be why it will offer some analytic tractability for this quadratic case.","I am studying a new formula that extracts solution to the diffusion-Smoluchowski equation and is rooted on the theory of complex calculus.

So I want to find the value of $$\int_0^{\alpha_\max} \mathrm{e}^{i \zeta \cos \alpha} \cos \alpha \, \sin^2 \alpha J_1(\xi \sin \alpha) \, \mathrm{d}\alpha \tag{1}$$ Let's take the series expansion for our Bessel function $$J_1(x) = \sum_{m=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^m}{m! \, \Gamma(m+2)} {\left(\tfrac{1}{2}x\right)}^{2m+1}.$$ If we plug this in and pretend life is good we want to compute $$\int_0^{\alpha_\max} \mathrm{e}^{i \zeta \cos \alpha} \, \sin^{2(m + 1) + 1} \alpha \, \cos \alpha \, \mathrm{d}\alpha$$ We also know $$\sin^{2(m + 1) + 1}\alpha = \frac{1}{4^{m + 1}} \sum_{k=0}^{m + 1} (-1)^{m - k + 1} \binom{2(m + 1) + 1}{k} \sin{((2(m - k + 1)\alpha)}$$ Alright! Let's just write this hideous integer in the $\sin$ as $m$ and we now want to compute $$\int_0^{\alpha_\max} \mathrm{e}^{i \zeta \cos \alpha} \, \sin(m \alpha) \, \cos \alpha \, \mathrm{d}\alpha$$ This looks quite friendly, doesn't it? We can simplify it even more using a trigonometric identity which is well known to those who know it well. I'll recycle $m$ again. So we want to compute $$\int_0^{\alpha_\max} \mathrm{e}^{i \zeta \cos \alpha} \, \sin(m \alpha) \, \mathrm{d}\alpha$$ Great! Messing a bit around with the integrand using Mathematica makes me suspect that the primitive is of the form $$\sum_{k = 0}^ {m - 1} c_k \mathrm{e}^{i \zeta \cos \alpha} \cos(k \alpha)$$ So let's compute its derivative shall we? $$\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}\alpha}\sum_{k = 0}^ {m - 1} c_k \mathrm{e}^{i \zeta \cos \alpha} \cos(k \alpha) = \sum_{k = 0}^m [-k c_k - \frac{i \zeta}{2} c_{k - 1} + \frac{i \zeta}{2} c_{k + 1}] \sin(k \alpha) \mathrm{e}^{i \zeta \rho \cos \alpha}$$ So we can extract by equating the previous to the integrand: $$\begin{align} c_m &= 0;\\ -k c_k - \frac{i \zeta}{2} c_{k - 1} + \frac{i \zeta}{2} c_{k + 1} &= 0 \text{ for } 1 < k < m;\\ -\frac{i \zeta}{2} c_{m - 1} &= 1;\\ -c_1 + \frac{i \zeta}{2} c_2 - i \rho c_0 &= 0. \end{align}$$ I have not the slightest clue how to solve this. Making a generating function gives a horrendous differential equation which would even make the devil cry. So, any suggestions on how to compute my dear integral $(1)$? Edit : I believe that: $$\newcommand{\d}{\, \mathrm{d}}\int J_1(\xi \sin\alpha) \d\alpha = \sum_{m = 0}^\infty \sum_{k = 0}^m \frac1{4^m} \frac{(-1)^m}{m!(m + 1)!} \frac{(-1)^{2m + 1 - k}}{2k + 1} {2m + 1 \choose m - k} \left(\frac{\xi}2 \right)^{2m + 1} \cos((2k + 1)\alpha).$$ Edit : It seems to be slightly off. I'll check again tomorrow it is past 2AM. Edit : Now it is correct.",,"['integration', 'special-functions', 'bessel-functions']"
67,Cauchy-Formula for Repeated Lebesgue-Integration,Cauchy-Formula for Repeated Lebesgue-Integration,,"Recently, I came across the following statements. They were annotated as consequences of Fubini's Theorem but neither proof nor reference were given. Let $f:[a,b]\times [a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$ be Lebesgue integrable.

Since $g$ is non-negative, it is clearly Lebesgue integrable. Consequently, $h:=f g$ is Lebesgue integrable. By Fubini's Theorem it follows that $$ \int_{[a,b]\times [a,b]} h(x,y)\,\mathrm{d}(x,y) =\int_a^b\int_a^b h(x,y)\,\mathrm{d}x\,\mathrm{d}y =\int_a^b\int_a^b h(x,y)\,\mathrm{d}y\,\mathrm{d}x\text{.} $$ Finally, $$ \int_a^b\int_a^b h(x,y)\,\mathrm{d}x\,\mathrm{d}y =\int_a^b\int_a^b f(x,y) g(x,y)\,\mathrm{d}x\,\mathrm{d}y =\int_a^b\int_a^y f(x,y)\,\mathrm{d}x\,\mathrm{d}y $$ and $$ \int_a^b\int_a^b h(x,y)\,\mathrm{d}y\,\mathrm{d}x =\int_a^b\int_a^b f(x,y) g(x,y)\,\mathrm{d}y\,\mathrm{d}x =\int_a^b\int_x^b f(x,y)\,\mathrm{d}y\,\mathrm{d}x $$ conclude the proof. We proceed by induction with respect to $n$. For $n=1$ the statement is trivial. Assuming its correctness for $n=m-1\in\mathbb{N}$, we prove the statement for $n=m$.

First of all, $(t,u)\mapsto\frac{(u-t)^{m-2}}{(m-2)!}$ is Lebesgue integrable since it is continuous. Moreover, $(t,u)\mapsto f(t)$ is Lebesgue integrable as tensor product of Lebesgue integrable functions. Eventually, $g$ is Lebesgue integrable as product of Lebesgue integrable functions.

Has been bothering me for a few days now. Note that the case from $0$ to $\pi/2$ has already been dealt with earlier. Some of the problems with the integral is the singularities at $x=\pi$ and $x=3\pi/2$ , hower as the right and left limits agree the integral does not diverge. Now I want to obtain the answer through substitutions and algebraic manipulation. I want to avoid all series representations (Catalan’s Constant) and alike. I think one has to split the integrals to avoid the singularities and then show they are alike without explicitly evalutating them. Note $$ \int_0^{2\pi} f(x) \mathrm{d}x = \int_0^\pi f(x) \mathrm{d}x + \int_\pi^{3\pi/2} f(x) \mathrm{d}x + \int_{3\pi/2}^{2\pi} f(x) \mathrm{d}x $$ Explicit calculations one have $$ \int_0^{\pi/2} f(x)\mathrm{d}x = -1 + 2\log 2 \quad \, \quad \int_{\pi}^{3\pi/2} f(x)\mathrm{d}x = 1 \\ \int_{\pi/2}^{\pi} f(x)\mathrm{d}x = 1 + 4 K-2 \log 2 \quad \, \quad \int_{3\pi/2}^{2\pi} f(x)\mathrm{d}x = -1 - 4 K $$ Where $K$ is Catalan's constant.
