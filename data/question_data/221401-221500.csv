0,Does a birational map of an affine variety extend uniquely to a birational map of its projective closure?,Does a birational map of an affine variety extend uniquely to a birational map of its projective closure?,,"Let $V \subset \mathbb{A}^n$ be an affine variety, and $\varphi: V \to V$ a birational map. Does there exist a unique birational map $\varphi' : V' \to V'$ of the projective closure $V' \subset \mathbb {P}^n$ of $V$ that agrees with $\varphi$ on $V \subset V'$? A rational map is an equivalence class of morphisms $U \to V$ with $U \subset V$ nonempty open, where two are equivalent if they agree on the intersection of their domains.

If $\varphi$ is locally given in coordinates by rational functions, how does one compute $\varphi'$?

Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field and consider a curve $C \subset \mathbb{P}^2$. Compute its genus, that is, the genus of its normalization, using data ""as local"" as possible. I understand that desingularization of plane curves is an old topic, but I would like to follow through the following approach. My idea was to use that for non-singular curves, $g = dim_k H^1(C, \mathcal{O}_C)$, and that for arbitrary plane curves $dim_k H^1(C, \mathcal{O}_C) = (d-1)(d-2)/2$, where $d$ is the degree. That is, we consider the normalization morphism $\pi: C' \to C$ and try to relate the first cohomology groups. This yields the following formula, for a (singular) plane curve $C$ with normaization $\pi: C' \to C$: $g(C) = (d-1)(d-2)/2 - \sum_{P \in C} dim_k \frac{\mathcal{O}_{C',P}}{\mathcal{O}_{C,P}}$.

68,Are all bivariate polynomials of degree < 7 non-injective on rational numbers?,Are all bivariate polynomials of degree < 7 non-injective on rational numbers?,,"In one of Alon Amit's interesting answers on the Quora website, he mentioned Don Zagier's conjecture that the bivariate polynomial $x^7 + 3y^7$ may be injective on rational numbers, that is, no two distinct pairs of rational values of $(x,y)$ produce the same value of $x^7 + 3y^7$ . Amit also referred to Bjorn Poonen's paper ""Multivariable polynomial injections on rational numbers"". The choice of this particular polynomial by Zagier for this conjecture makes me curious: What about even simpler polynomials with smaller exponents? Presumably they are expected to be non-injective on rational numbers, if Zagier chose $x^7 + 3y^7$ in particular as a candidate to be injective. But is there a proof that all polynomials of the forms $$ ax^3 + by^3,\\ ax^3 + by^5,\\ ax^5 + by^5,\\ ax^3 + by^7,\\ ax^5 + by^7 $$ are non-injective on rational numbers? Or at least, for small values of $a,b < 10$ , are there known distinct pairs of rational values of $(x,y)$ showing that each such polynomial is non-injective? Certain such polynomials have trivial or extremely simple examples showing that they are non-injective on rational numbers, such as $x^3 + 7y^3$ : $(1,1)$ and $(2,0)$ produce identical values. Also, any polynomial of the form $x^n + 2y^n$ , where $n$ is odd, has the trivial pair of rational values $(1,0)$ and $(-1,1)$ producing identical values. (Indeed any pair $(k,0)$ and $(-k, k)$ produce identical values of such polynomials). A less trivial example is $x^3 + 3y^3$ , for which $(3,-1)$ and $(0,2)$ both produce the value of $24$ . But other such polynomials do not appear to have such simple non-injective solutions. For example, what is a pair of rational values of $(x,y)$ that produce identical values of $x^5 + 3y^5$ ? By the way, this is equivalent to finding a sum or difference of two fifth powers of integers that is exactly 3 times another such sum or difference of two fifth powers. Likewise, Zagier's conjecture that $x^7 + 3y^7$ is injective on rational numbers is equivalent to the claim that there does not exist any sum or difference of two seventh powers that is exactly 3 times another sum or difference of two seventh powers. An example of a 5th degree polynomial with relatively small coefficients that I can show to be non-injective on rationals in a non-trivial way is $3x^5 + 22y^5$ , for which $(1,1)$ and $(3,-2)$ both produce the value of $25$ . Even better examples with very small coefficients are $x^5 + 4y^5$ , for which $(1,4)$ and $(5,3)$ both produce the value of $4097$ , and $x^5 + 8y^5$ , for which $(1,4)$ and $(-7,5)$ both produce the value of $8193$ . But it does not appear to be a simple matter to find such polynomials, and I imagine it would be quite difficult to show that all such 5th degree bivariate polynomials are non-injective on rationals. The existence of the simple examples for 5th degree polynomials cited above is related to the fact that all fifth powers of integers are equivalent to 1, -1, or 0 modulo 11. This creates numerous small ratios of the many sums and/or differences of fifth powers which have 11 as a common factor: $2^5 + 1^5$ , $3^5 - 1^5$ , $4^5 - 3^5$ , $5^5 - 1^5$ , $5^5 - 4^5$ , $7^5 + 1^5$ , etc. Perhaps this is one reason that Zagier did not conjecture that a simple 5th degree bivariate polynomial is injective on rationals. It appears that the sums and differences of seventh powers do not share nearly as many common factors. Some of them have the common factor 29, since all seventh powers of integers are equivalent to 1, -1, 12, -12, or 0 modulo 29, and some have the common factor 43, since all seventh powers are equivalent to 1, -1, 6, -6, 7, -7, or 0 modulo 43. But these common factors do not appear to be dense enough to produce small ratios akin to those of the sums and differences of fifth powers. Update: Robert Israel has found the following examples showing that certain additional 5th degree polynomials of the form $x^5 + by^5$ are non-injective on rational numbers: $11^5 + 7^5 = 177858 = 6 * (8^5 - 5^5)$ $2698^5 + 1052^5 = 144246898755300000 = 16 * (1685^5 - 1355^5)$ $23^5 + 11^5 = 6597394 = 17 * (15^5 - 13^5)$ $59^5 + 17^5 = 716344156 = 19 * (39^5 - 35^5)$ $65^5 - 63^5 = 167854082 = 22 * (22^5 + 19^5)$ $131^5 - 116^5 = 17576073075 = 25 * (59^5 - 26^5)$ The lack of such examples with 5th powers up to $3000^5 = 243000000000000000$ (243 quadrillion) for $x^5 + 3y^5$ , $x^5 + 5y^5$ , $x^5 + 7y^5$ , and multiples of $3, 5, 7$ except for $3*2 = 6$ and $5^2 = 25$ remains striking.","In one of Alon Amit's interesting answers on the Quora website, he mentioned Don Zagier's conjecture that the bivariate polynomial may be injective on rational numbers, that is, no two distinct pairs of rational values of produce the same value of .

I want to understand the connections between two different actions of $G$ on objects relating to $X$ . I will begin by stating their definitions and what I know about them. There are two natural ways to define a left action of $G$ on $X(K)$ . The first is to let $\sigma\in G$ act on a point $x\in X(K)$ by post-composition: to $\sigma$ , there is an associated morphism $\sigma^\flat\!:\Spec{K}\to\Spec{K}$ , and we set $\sigma x := x\circ\sigma^\flat$ . It is then not hard to check that this is a left group action. A different approach is to use the identification of $X(K)$ with pairs $(x,j)$ , where $x\in X$ and $j\!:\kappa(x)\hookrightarrow K$ is an embedding of the residue field at $x$ into $K$ . One can then define the action by $(x,j)\mapsto (x,j\circ\sigma)$ .

Is the ""finite ambiguity"" in this sense that each point near $(0,0)$ is determined by its values on these functions up to the sign of the $x$ -coordinate? For example the point $(1,0)$ isn't quite defined uniquely by these values, but there are only finitely many other points which share the same values, namely just $(-1,0)$ . If that is the case, then I'm wondering if this characterisation is necessary and sufficient, but don't really know how to begin proving it.

Then is this criteria necessary and sufficient for $x_1,\ldots,x_d$ to be a system of parameters for $R$ ? Edit: It seems like there are trivial counterexamples to my criteria as written. For example, if we localise at the point $(1,1)$ instead of $(0,0)$ as in his example, then clearly no power of $(x-1,y-1)$ lies in $(y,y-x^2)$ . Then $y,y-x^2$ cannot be a system of parameters for this new ring, despite satisfying my conditions. However if we specify additionally that $p$ lies in the subvariety $V(x_1,\ldots,x_d)$ , then this rules out such counterexamples. This is also consistent with his example.

91,Cohomology Class of a Subvariety,Cohomology Class of a Subvariety,,"I'm working on question 7.4 of Chapter III.7 in Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometry. The question is about the cohomology class of a subvariety. The setup is as follows: $X$ is an $n$-dimensional non-singular projective variety over an algebraically closed field $k$. $Y\subset X$ is a non-singular subvariety of codimension $p$. We have the standard map $\Omega_X\otimes \mathcal{O}_Y \rightarrow \Omega_Y$ from which we can deduce a map $\Omega_X^{n-p} \rightarrow \Omega_Y^{n-p}$, and this in turn yields a map on cohomology $H^{n-p}(X, \Omega_X^{n-p}) \rightarrow H^{n-p}(Y,\Omega_Y^{n-p})$. Now $Y$ is $(n-p)$-dimensional so $\Omega_Y^{n-p} = \omega_Y$ and we have the trace map $H^{n-p}(Y,\Omega_Y^{n-p} = \omega_Y) \rightarrow k$. Composing with this trace map we have $\varphi_Y : H^{n-p}(X,\Omega_X^{n-p})\rightarrow k$. Now, since by Serre Duality $H^p(X,\Omega_X^p) \cong H^{n-p}(X, \Omega_X^{n-p})^{\lor}$, $\varphi_Y$ corresponds to an element $\eta(Y) \in H^p(X,\Omega_X^p)$ which we call the cohomology class of $Y$ . Part (a) of the problem asks to show that if $P\in X$ is a closed point, then $t_X(\eta(P)) = 1$, where $t_X$ is the trace map on $\omega_X$. Now, in the case of a point, the map $\Omega_X^{n-p} \rightarrow \Omega_Y^{n-p}$ is simply the map $\mathcal{O}_X \cong \Omega_X^0 \rightarrow \Omega_P^0\cong k_P$ defined by $f \mapsto f(P)$ which, when composed with the trace map on $H^0(P,\omega_P)$, yields $f \mapsto t_P(f(P))$. This map should correspond to an element $\eta(P) \in H^n(X,\Omega_X^n = \omega_X)$ as indicated above. My problem is, I don't know how to get my hands on $\eta(P)$. All I know is that it should exist. Moreover, I thought that $H^n(X, \omega_X) \rightarrow k$ is only a map of $k$-vector spaces.

94,Parametrising the Clebsch cubic,Parametrising the Clebsch cubic,,"The Clebsch cubic surface is a famous cubic surface whose 27 lines are all defined over the real numbers. It can be described as the solution set of the equation (in homogeneous coordinates) $$x^3+y^3+z^3+w^3 =(x+y+z+w)^3 \quad (\ast)$$ On the other hand, like any cubic surface, it is parametrised by the four-dimensional space of cubic curves passing through six given points in the plane. In this special case the points are the vertices of a pentagon together with its centre. Choosing a basis $(f_1,f_2,f_3,f_4)$ for that space gives a rational map $\mathbf P^2 \dashrightarrow \mathbf P^3$  sending $x$ to $(f_1(x), f_2(x), f_3(x), f_4(x))$, and blowing up the six base points makes this an isomorphism onto its image. For an arbitrary choice of basis of this space, the image will be projectively equivalent to the Clebsch cubic, but it won't be exactly the solution set of the above equation. Question: How do we choose $(f_1,f_2,f_3,f_4)$ so that the image of this map is exactly the solution set of the equation $(\ast)$ above?

But this curve is the same as the solution set of $f_i=0$, unless it contains one of the exceptional lines. So each of the $f_i$ should be a product of 3 linear forms, or the union of a conic through 5 of the 6 points and a line through 2 of the 6 points, only one of which lies on the conic. I guess there is a simple brute-force method to answer this question, as follows: pick any basis for the space of cubic curves, find the degree-3 equation they satisfy, find the necessary linear transformation to put that in Clebsch form, then apply that transformation to the elements of the original basis. But there is something repugnant about that way of solving it: the setup of the problem is so beautiful and symmetric that one ought to be able to find the answer ""by pure thought"". However, I have failed to do that so far. Please enlighten me!","The Clebsch cubic surface is a famous cubic surface whose 27 lines are all defined over the real numbers. It can be described as the solution set of the equation (in homogeneous coordinates) $$x^3+y^3+z^3+w^3 =(x+y+z+w)^3 \quad (\ast)$$ On the other hand, like any cubic surface, it is parametrised by the four-dimensional space of cubic curves passing through six given points in the plane. In this special case the points are the vertices of a pentagon together with its centre. Choosing a basis $(f_1,f_2,f_3,f_4)$ for that space gives a rational map $\mathbf P^2 \dashrightarrow \mathbf P^3$  sending $x$ to $(f_1(x), f_2(x), f_3(x), f_4(x))$, and blowing up the six base points makes this an isomorphism onto its image. For an arbitrary choice of basis of this space, the image will be projectively equivalent to the Clebsch cubic, but it won't be exactly the solution set of the above equation.

95,Why are projective coordinate rings not isomorphic when the corresponding projective varieties are?,Why are projective coordinate rings not isomorphic when the corresponding projective varieties are?,,"I was trying to prove the following question from An Invitation to Algebraic Geometry by Karen Smith: Show that the homogeneous coordinate rings of projectively equivalent varieties are isomorphic. Here is my attempt : Let $V,W$ be projective varieties in $\mathbb{P}^n$. Let $\phi:V\rightarrow W$ be the linear change of coordinates map and $\psi:W\rightarrow V$ be its inverse map. Define a map $\alpha:\mathbb{C}[V]→\mathbb{C}[W]$ by $\alpha(f)=f\circ\psi$.  Let $f\circ\psi=0$ on $\mathbb{C}[W]$. Since $\psi$ is a bijection between $W$ and $V$, $f$ must be zero on $\mathbb{C}[V]$. This shows that $\alpha$ is injective. To show that it is surjective, we see that for any $g\in\mathbb{C}[W]$, $f=g\circ \phi$ is sent to $g\circ \phi\circ\psi=g$ by $\alpha$. Now we show that $\alpha$ is a ring homomorphism.  $$\alpha(f+g)=(f+g)\circ\psi=f\circ\psi+g\circ\psi=\alpha(f)+\alpha(g)\\ \alpha(fg)=(fg)\circ\psi=(f\circ\psi)(g\circ\psi)=\alpha(f)\alpha(g)$$ My question is , why does this proof not work for any isomorphic varieties?
