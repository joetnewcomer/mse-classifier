21,Definition of Equivalent Norms,Definition of Equivalent Norms,,"Two norms $F,G$ are equivalent when there are constants $a,b$ such that $aF \le G \le bF$.  I'm reading about this idea, and so far I've seen that equivalence of norms implies that the underlying space $X$ has the same topology with respect to either norm.  Maybe it preserves even more properties than this too. But I'm finding it very difficult to use this property when doing proofs or problems because although it's very simple to state, I don't immediately see what it is saying.  In comparison, when you define 'equivalence' in other settings, like in the definition of an isomorphism of abelian groups or a continuous map, it's very clear that a certain operation or object is being preserved as you pass across a map. To be concrete, here are my questions: (1) Is there another way to characterize when norms are equivalent that might provide more intuition for what it says about is being preserved and (2) is there a way to show that this definition is the one you want by starting with something more fundamental (like saying that the norms induce the same topology) and then proving that it's equivalent to the stated definition?

And even then, suppose that we know that there is some metric that makes this group completely metrizable, what would this imply about this group with the compact open topology?",,"['general-topology', 'topological-groups', 'descriptive-set-theory']"

Similarly, for any element of the covering $U_{i}$, let $\tau_{i}:\pi_{1}(U_{i},x_{0})\longrightarrow \pi_{1}(X,x_{0})$ be the map induced by the inclusion. Let $H$ be a group and $\rho_{i}:\pi_{1}(U_{i},x_{0})\longrightarrow H$ any collection of homomorphisms defined for all $i\in I$ and such that if $U_{i}\subseteq U_{j}$ then $\rho_{i}=\rho_{j}\circ \phi_{ij}$. Then, there exists a unique homomorphism $\lambda:\pi_{1}(X,x_{0})\longrightarrow H$ such that $\rho_{i} = \lambda \circ \tau_{i}$, for all $i\in I$. Moreover, this universal mapping condition characterizes $\pi_{1}(X,x_{0})$ up to a unique isomorphism. It is well-known that this statement does not always hold if we consider $n$-th homotopy groups with $n\geq 2$, and I believe that easy examples of this fact could be constructed. However, I would like to understand the intrinsic reason behind this phenomenon. We can roughly say that the proof of Seifert-Van Kampen is divided in two parts. (1) With the notation above, the group $\pi_{1}(X,x_{0})$ is generated by the union of the images of $\pi_{1}(U_{i},x_{0})$ via the maps $\tau_{i}$. (2) For any $[\alpha]\in\pi_{1}(X,x_{0})$, consider the decomposition $[\alpha]=  [\alpha_{1}]...[\alpha_{n}]$ given in point (1). Then the morphism $\lambda([\alpha])=\rho_{1}([\alpha_{1}])...\rho_{n}([\alpha_{n}])$ is well-defined. Which one of the two parts fails with $n$-th homotopy groups? Why?",,"['general-topology', 'algebraic-topology']"

Now, we may consider the set $X=\{M:M\;\mbox{is an $L$-structure}\}$ and define a topology on $X$ as follows: For each $L$ -sentence $\sigma$ define a basic open set $U_{\sigma}=\{M\in X:M\vDash\sigma\}$ . Open sets in $X$ are arbitrary unions and finite intersections of the basic open sets $U_{\sigma}$ . A few facts we observe are: $X$ does not seem to be Hausdorff (not even $T_{0}$ ), and the connected components of $X$ appear to be the equivalence classes of structures by the relation $\equiv$ of elementary equivalence of $L$ -structures . In fact, for each $L$ -structure $M$ we let $T_{M}=\{\sigma\in S_{L}:M\vDash\sigma\}$ , and consider the set $Y=\{T_{M}:M\;\mbox{is an $L$-structure}\}$ .

I believe I can show that the Compactness Theorem is true if and only if $Y$ (resp. $X$ ) is a compact space. My question is: Is there a purely topological proof showing that $Y$ (resp $X$ ) is a compact topological space? Note: Where does this question come from? From working out the analogous situation for propositional logic (i.e. $L$ is a propositional language) and trying to work out the case for first order logic.

The idea is always that isomorphic objects share every property that a mathematician in that field would care about: Homeomorphic topological spaces have all their topological properties in common, group isomorphisms have all their group-theoretic properties in common, and so on. But at the end of the day, we still have to verify by hand that any given property is preserved by an isomorphism in the category we're working in. For example, say we're working in group theory. It is intuitively obvious that under an isomorphism $\phi : G \to H$ , corresponding elements have the same order, compose in the same way, $\phi$ takes subgroups to subgroups, normal subgroups to normal subgroups, centers to centers, and any group constructed out of $G$ (direct/semidirect products, quotients, etc) should yield an isomorphic result when $G$ is replaced by $H$ .

It feels like it should be the case that all of these properties correspond between $G$ and $H$ , but nonetheless we have to verify each of them one at a time.

If we now define $Z_{n+1}$ as the pushout of $N\rho_n\times I\leftarrow N\rho_n\to Z_n$, this induces a unique map $\rho_{n+1}:Z_{n+1}\to Y$ making certain triangles commute.

Let $Z$ be the colimit of the sequence $Z_0\hookrightarrow Z_1\hookrightarrow \dots$, with $\nu:Z_0\hookrightarrow Z$ the initial inclusion into this colimit. Since all the maps $\nu_n$ are acyclic cofibrations, so is $\nu$. If $\rho:Z\to Y$ denotes the map induced by the $\rho_n$, then $\rho\nu=f$, so it suffices to show that $\rho$ is a fibration.

One can show that, since we are working in the category of weak Hausdorff $k$-spaces, the canonical map $\text{colim}N\rho_n\to N\rho$ is a homeomorphism. Also, $\text{colim}(N\rho_n\times I)\cong N\rho\times I$. This way, the map $N\rho\to Z$ is the colimit of the maps $N\rho_n\to Z_n$. So practically all the objects in the square are colimits.

Thanks! -Roy","I'm trying to complete the following exercise I found in a topology book: Construct a space A which is path-connected with fundamental group equal to $\langle r,s | r^2 s^3 r^3 s^2 = 1\rangle$, and find a unique (connected) double-covering B. Find some presentation also for $\Pi_1(B)$. Now the space I had in mind for A was a 10-sided polygon with edges identified, much like they are in (say) the Klein bottle, the first 2 edges identified in the same direction, and also identified with the 6th, 7th and 8th edges in that direction, and the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 10th and 10th edges identified all in the same direction too. Then by Seifert Van-Kampen we can remove a small disc in the center of the polygon to get the fundamental gp we want. However, I am having problems picturing any sort of sensible double-cover for A: could anyone suggest anything? For something like the Klein bottle it's reasonably easy to just join another Klein bottle on at one of the edges to get a torus, but can we do the same here? Just add another copy of A associated at 1 edge (or all edges)? I'm not entirely sure how it works.

94,Why isn't a continuous bijection from a locally compact space to a Hausdorff space an homeomorphism?,Why isn't a continuous bijection from a locally compact space to a Hausdorff space an homeomorphism?,,"I know that if $f : X \rightarrow Y$ is a continuous bijection from a compact space $X$ to a Hausdorff space $Y$, then $f$ is an homeomorphism. So I was thinking that if we relax the assumption $X$ compact to $X$ locally compact, it should be true as well. Using the above result, $f$ is an homeomorphism if we restrict it to a compact neighborhood of $X$. Since we can find a compact neighborhood around every point of $X$, $f$ should be a local homeomorphism. But a bijective local homeomorphism is a global homeomorphism, so that would be it. Yet, if I'm not mistaken, the map $f : [0, 2\pi[ \rightarrow S^1, f(\theta) = e^{i\theta}$ is a counterexample.

95,Quotient space of the reals by the rationals,Quotient space of the reals by the rationals,,"Let $\mathbb{R}/{\sim}$ be the quotient space given by the equivalence relation $a \sim b$ if $a$ and $b$ are rational. I am trying to understand general properties of the quotient topology and this example seems worth fleshing out in full. It's also a very strange example to me so I'd appreciate feedback on what I've figured out so far. In order to figure out what the topology on $\mathbb{R}/{\sim}$ looks like we need to examine where the surjection $\pi: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}/{\sim}$ sends open sets in $\mathbb{R}$. Now any open interval $U \subset \mathbb{R}$ contains both irrational and rational points; the rationals all get sent to the same point $q$ while the irrationals get sent to separate points. So an open set in $\mathbb{R}/{\sim}$ is similar to an open set in the irrationals as a subspace of the reals (with the caveat that all open sets in $\mathbb{R}/{\sim}$ share the rational point $q$). Is this space connected? I believe so as I can't think of a proper separation. As Alex notes below this is not correct: My professor also mentioned this space is an example where a compact subset, namely the irrationals, is not closed. As for compactness I think it is for this reason: the rationals are dense in $\mathbb{R}$, so if we put an open neighborhood around each rational then we will cover $\mathbb{R}$. Similarly, if we put an open neighborhood around the rational point $q \in \mathbb{R}/{\sim}$, then this single neighborhood will contain all irrational points and thus be a finite cover of $\mathbb{R}/{\sim}$ . Are there any other significant properties of this space I should know about? In particular, is it homeomorphic to anything notable? Does it serve as a useful counterexample for any other important properties?
