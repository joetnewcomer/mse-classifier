10,Combinatorics: Number of Six-Card Hands That Can Be Dealt from r Combined Decks,Combinatorics: Number of Six-Card Hands That Can Be Dealt from r Combined Decks,,"I am having trouble solving this combinatorial problem dealing with the number of different card hands possible from multiple decks of identical cards. Here is the exact question: Use a combinatorial argument to count the number of different six-card hands that can be dealt from r combined decks, for each positive integer r. I assumed that if r > 6 it would not effect the answer because at most a card can be repeated six times. Therefore, I interpreted the question as asking to use a combinatorial argument to count the number of different six-card hands that can be dealt from a sextuple deck. From that point I found eleven different situations that could occur represented by the following sequences: 123456, 112345, 112234, 112233, 111234, 111223, 111222, 111123, 111122, 111112, 11111. By this notation I mean that the first sequence represents a six-card hand with zero cards repeating, the second contains 1 repeat, the third contains 2 repeats, and the fourth contains 3 repeats. I then attempted to represent this using binomial coefficients: $$\binom{52}{6}\binom{6}{0}+\binom{52}{5}\binom{5}{1}+\binom{52}{4}\binom{4}{2}+\binom{52}{3}\binom{3}{3}+\binom{52}{4}\binom{4}{1}+\binom{52}{3}\binom{3}{1}\binom{2}{1}+\binom{52}{2}\binom{2}{2}+\binom{52}{3}\binom{3}{1}+\binom{52}{2}\binom{2}{1}\binom{1}{1}+\binom{52}{2}\binom{2}{1}+\binom{52}{1}\binom{1}{1},$$ but I was mainly confused about the sixth binomfial coefficient $\binom{52}{3}\binom{3}{1}\binom{2}{1}$ representing the sequence 111223 where is one card thrice repeated and another twice repeated.

These come from section 5-1 (the basics of counting), pages 344 - 347. This question is not specifically about finding an answer to a problem or being given the correct equation, but whether my reasoning is sound.  Therefore I would find it hard to argue this is a duplicate of seemingly similar questions like this one or this one . The problems I have been dealing with come of the form How many positive integers in range [x,y] are divisible by d? All additional questions are based on the composition of the information learned in these, e.g. how many positive integers in range [x,y] are divisible by d or e? To answer the simple question I wrote this ""equation/algorithm,"" which takes as input an inclusive range of positive integers $[x,y]$ and a positive integer $d$, and returns $n$, the total number of positive integers in range $[x,y]$ which are divisible by $d$. (1) $n = \left \lfloor{\frac{y}{d}}\right \rfloor - \left \lfloor{\frac{x}{d}}\right \rfloor$ The idea is that in order to count how many positive integers are divisible by $d$ from $[1,m]$, we simply calculate $\left \lfloor{\frac{m}{d}}\right \rfloor$, because every $dth$ positive integer must be divisible by $d$.  However, this does not work when given a range $[x,y]$ where $x \not= 1$ or when $x > 1$.  So we need to subtract the extra integers we counted, which is $\left \lfloor{\frac{x}{d}}\right \rfloor$, i.e. the number of positive integers divisible by $d$ from $[1,x]$. For a sanity check, I also wrote a brute force algorithm that does a linear search over every positive integer in the range $[x,y]$ and counts it if $x \text{ mod } d == 0$.  It also can list out the integers it picked, in case I am feeling really paranoid. With (1) I've been getting the correct answers except on this problem/input: How many positive integers between 100 and 999 inclusive are odd? My solution was to calculate how many are even, and subtract this from the total number of positive integers in range $[100,999]$.  To find the evens I simply use the algorithm in (1): $\left \lfloor{\frac{999}{2}}\right \rfloor - \left \lfloor{\frac{100}{2}}\right \rfloor = 499 - 50 = 449$ But this answer is wrong, since there actually $450$ even numbers in range $[100,999]$ by the brute force algorithm.  (1) is somehow counting off by 1.  My question is, why is (1) failing for this input of $(2, [100,999])$ but so far it's worked on every other input?  What do I need to do to fix (1) so it produces the correct answer for this case?  Perhaps I'm actually over counting because $x$ should actually be $x - 1$? (1') $n = \left \lfloor{\frac{y}{d}}\right \rfloor - \left \lfloor{\frac{x - 1}{d}}\right \rfloor$ (1') returns the correct answer for this specific input now, but I am not sure if it will break my other solutions.","I have been solving basic counting problems from Kenneth Rosen's Discrete Mathematics textbook (6th edition) .

Since $k=4$, we expect to find the 4 nearest nodes within $4/0.1 = 40$ cells. We cover 40 cells when our search radius $r$ is 4, since 4+8+12+16 = 40.

Find the inverse of each one of the matrices belonging to this group. I know that the matrix inverse is on the form as the matrix A above. One of the matrices belonging to the group $G_M$ is $$B=\binom{2\ 2}{0\ 1}\qquad$$ since if a and b is in $Z_3$ then 0<=a,b<=2 with a>0. The matrix multiplication gives me $$B*A =\binom{2a\ 2b+2}{0\ 1}\qquad=\binom{1\ 0}{0\ 1}\qquad=I$$ Now i can solve the equation $$2a=1 (in Z_3)$$ and $$2b+2=0 (in Z_3) <=> 2b=1 (in Z_3)$$. So, these equations tells us, since it equal to 1, that a and b are the multiplicative inverses to 2.

And since the solution above will be the same for the equations $2a=1$ and $2b=1$ in $Z_3$, we can tell that a=b=2 .

To summarize , my question is: How do I find the generating function of this recurrence.  Is there any generalized approach for doing so? What is the role of Diophantine equations? Does a generating function necessarily exist for all recurrences? (Only asked because of no sequence on OEIS) If so, then please elaborate.","I am solving a problem on an Online Judge. The problems solution boils down to find the solutions to the following recurrence relation: ways(p,q)=4*min(p-1,q-1)+2*(p-1+q-1)+ways(p-1,q)+ways(p,q-1)-ways(p-1,q-1) The constraints specified on p,q (both independently) are 10^6, so any brute force attempt will timeout. In order to solve this recurrence I searched on OEIS for smaller values (p=2 , p=3 and so on). However I found only a satisafactory recurrence for (p=2 or q=2) and not for others. Wikipedia suggests that the solutions to this recurrence should be solutions to a Diophantine equation in p,q. Is it so?
