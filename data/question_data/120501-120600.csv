Without loss of generality, we assume $A_ix + B_iy + C_i | _{(0,0)} < 0,  i=1,...,4$ , namely $C_i < 0, i=1,...,4$ . Thus, divided by $-C_i > 0$ on both sides of the line equation, we reduce the original line equation to $a_ix + b_iy - 1 = 0 (a_i^2+b_i^2 \ne 0), i=1,...,4$ where $a_i = A_i/(-C_i)$ and $b_i = B_i/(-C_i)$ . We will use the reduced equation in this problem, and for convenience I formally write it as a theorem below: Theorem: Any line not passing through the origin can be represented as $a_ix + b_iy - 1 = 0 (a_i^2+b_i^2 \ne 0)$ (namely, the set of all lines not passing through the origin = $\{ax+by-1=0: a,b \in \mathbb{R} \wedge a^2+b^2 \ne 0\}$ = $\{ax+by+c = 0: a,b,c \in \mathbb{R} \wedge a^2+b^2 \ne 0 \wedge c \ne 0\}$ ); Also, a line always cuts the whole plane into two half planes, and this representation ensures that any point in the same half plane as the origin $(0,0)$ always makes $a_ix + b_iy - 1 < 0$ . We define the half plane of a line where the origin locates as the inner side, and the other half plane as the outer side of the line. Problem: which constraints (on coefficients $a_i,b_i$ ) of the lines need to be formulated to guarantee that the area $S : = \{(x,y): \bigwedge a_ix + b_iy - 1 < 0(a_i^2+b_i^2 \ne 0), i = 1,...,4\}$ is a closed convex (the definition of $S$ guarantees if $S$ enclosed then it is convex) quadrilateral?

31,Geometry Question: A property of a convex polyhedron.,Geometry Question: A property of a convex polyhedron.,,"I'm trying to interpret a verified solution for the following problem. Show that $v_3+f_3>0$ . Here, $v_n$ denotes the number of vertices of a convex polyhedron that meet with $n$ edges, and $f_n$ denotes the number of faces that have $n$ edges. The solution that I'm reading uses the property that the sum of angles (between two consecutive edges) around any vertex is less than $2\pi$ , and it proceeds as follows. Let $F,V,E$ be # of faces, vertices, and edges of a convex polyhedron. And, assume that $v_3+f_3=0$ . As we already know that the sum of angles around a vertex must be less than $2\pi$ , we get a following inequality: $\sum \text{angles} < 2\pi V$ . But, $\sum \text{angles} = \sum (n-2)f_n \pi$ because the sum of angles of an $n$ -gon is $(n-2)\pi$ . i.e. $V>\sum (n-2)f_n$ . (This is where I'm having problem.) Note that $E=\frac{1}{2}\sum nf_n$ . So, $2 = V + F - E > \sum (\frac{n}{2}-1)f_n$ . It is clear to see that $v_3+f_3 \geq 0$ , but assuming $v_3+f_3=0$ gives us a contradiction because when $n \geq 4$ , $2>\sum f_n$ , which is not possible. The problematic part: $V>\sum (n-2)f_n$ First, I thought this was a typo, and I thought it was supposed to be $2V>\sum (n-2)f_n$ as we can cancel $\pi$ out on both sides of the previous inequality. However, then this inequality only gives me that $2>0$ , which doesn't imply anything. $$2V>\sum (n-2)f_n \\ \Rightarrow V>\sum(\frac{n}{2}-1)f_n \\ \Rightarrow 2=V+F-E>0$$ So, now I'm trying to observe for any weird convex polyhedron so that I can find a counterexample of $V>\sum (n-2)f_n$ , but the inequality seems right. I am wondering where did this inequality come from, and if possible, I would like to know details behind here that are probably omitted because of the obvious reasons that I'm missing here. Any help would be greatly appreciated.","I'm trying to interpret a verified solution for the following problem. Show that .

I don't see where my mistake is, so I would appreciate some feedback on my solution, thanks. My solution: Since the cones are equilateral their lateral surface is $\pi r\cdot 2r=2\pi r^2$ ; the lateral surface of the cyilinder is $2\pi rh$ , where $h$ is the height of the cylinder so the total lateral surface is $S=2\pi r^2+2\pi r h$ .

40,How to parametrise a hyperplane without making assumptions on the coefficients of its normal vector?,How to parametrise a hyperplane without making assumptions on the coefficients of its normal vector?,,"Consider a vector $w\in\mathbb R^n$ , and its orthogonal complement: $$w^\perp\equiv\left\{v\in\mathbb R^n: \langle v,w\rangle\equiv\sum_{i=1}^n v_i w_i=0\right\}.$$ I'm looking into ways to parametrise $w^\perp$ . As also discussed in Parametric equation for a plane perpendicular to a vector , the trivial way to do this is to assume one parameter to be nonzero, and remove one free parameter in the standard way. In other words, assuming e.g. $w_n\neq 0$ , we have the parametrisation $$w^\perp=\left\{ t_1 e_1+ ...+t_{n-1}e_{n-1} - \frac{1}{w_n}\left(\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} w_k t_k\right) e_n: \,\, t_k\in\mathbb R \right\},$$ using $n-1$ free parameters, as expected. This approach has, however, the downside of having to make assumptions on $w$ --- namely, it works when some coefficient is nonzero. While there is always some nonzero coefficient, this makes the solution somewhat unelegant. A slightly different approach is given in this answer to the question linked above. The idea, as far as I understand it, is that we can quite elegantly parametrise $w^\perp$ , if we accept using an overcomplete basis. This relies on the easy observation that all the vectors of the form $$v_{ij}\equiv w_i e_j - w_j e_i,$$ where $i\neq j$ , satisfy $\langle v_{ij},w\rangle=0$ . One can then write $$w^\perp = \left\{ \sum_{i<j} c_{ij} v_{ij} : \,\, c_{ij}\in\mathbb R \right\}.$$ This uses $\binom{n}{2}$ coefficients to parametrise an $(n-1)$ -dimensional hyperplane, and thus is clearly overcomplete. Geometrically, we are writing the orthogonal complement as a linear combination of vectors that are orthogonal to the projections of $w$ on two-dimensional subspaces. From this point of view, a straightforward generalisation of the same idea would be to use as ""basis"" a set of vectors orthogonal to the projections of $w$ onto $k$ -dimensional subspaces, for $k=2,...,n-1$ . In some comments to the question linked above , a possible link with affine/projective geometry is hinted, but not fully explored. I'm curious to know if there is a good way to understand why this type of ""overparametrisation"" is possible from the point of view of projective geometry, and why it doesn't require making assumptions on some coefficients, which seems to be inevitable for any parametrisation that only uses the ""right"" amount of coefficients.","Consider a vector , and its orthogonal complement: I'm looking into ways to parametrise .

Please forgive any breach of ettiquette as I am new to mathematics exchange.  I did search for a solution before posting this. I am taking a regular polygon (of arbitrary n sides) and adding a random value (between 1 and -1) to the length of each ""spoke"" (ie. each circumradius line segment).  I'd like to shift the random values so that when they are added to the polygon's spokes, the polygon's area is the same as the original polygon's area. I naively assumed that subtracting the total average of the values from each value (thus making the average of the values be 0) would do this, but this clearly does not work. Here is an example of what I'd like to achieve: I have an n=4 regular polygon (a square) with a circumradius of 1.  The area of this polygon is 2.  I also have a random value for each point of the polygon: (0.85, -0.75, 0.6, -0.4).  If I add these values to the ""spokes"" of the polygon then the resulting polygon has spokes of length (1.85, 0.25, 1.6, 0.6) and an area of: 1.85 * 0.25 * 0.5  +  0.25 * 1.6 * 0.5  +  1.6 * 0.6 * 0.5  +  0.6 * 1.85 * 0.5 1.46625 I'd like to shift the random values so that the resulting polygon has an area of 2 (ie. the original area).  If I reduce the values by their average of 0.075 then I get (0.775, -0.825, 0.525, -0.475). Adding these shifted values to the polygon results in a polygon with spokes of length (1.775, 0.175, 1.525, 0.525), which average out to 1.  The polygon's area is then: 1.775 * 0.175 * 0.5  +  0.175 * 1.525 * 0.5  +  1.525 * 0.525 * 0.5  +  0.525 * 1.775 * 0.5 1.155 So shifting to get an average of 0 does not work.  My question: What would I shift by instead so that the resulting polygon has the same area as the original polygon? EDIT: joriki provided a solid answer to this question that was akin to normalizing a vector.  Unfortunately, this technique involves calculating the area of the resulting polygon, which becomes a bottleneck in software implementation (I am solving this problem each frame for a number of regular polygons of n=64 each).  I can try to optimize the solution if this is the only option, but a less computationally expensive solution would be preferred.","I have a 2d graphics question that seems like it'd fit better here than at stackoverflow.

I'd like to shift the random values so that when they are added to the polygon's spokes, the polygon's area is the same as the original polygon's area. I naively assumed that subtracting the total average of the values from each value (thus making the average of the values be 0) would do this, but this clearly does not work. Here is an example of what I'd like to achieve: I have an n=4 regular polygon (a square) with a circumradius of 1.  The area of this polygon is 2.  I also have a random value for each point of the polygon: (0.85, -0.75, 0.6, -0.4).  If I add these values to the ""spokes"" of the polygon then the resulting polygon has spokes of length (1.85, 0.25, 1.6, 0.6) and an area of: 1.85 * 0.25 * 0.5  +  0.25 * 1.6 * 0.5  +  1.6 * 0.6 * 0.5  +  0.6 * 1.85 * 0.5 1.46625 I'd like to shift the random values so that the resulting polygon has an area of 2 (ie. the original area).  If I reduce the values by their average of 0.075 then I get (0.775, -0.825, 0.525, -0.475). Adding these shifted values to the polygon results in a polygon with spokes of length (1.775, 0.175, 1.525, 0.525), which average out to 1.  The polygon's area is then: 1.775 * 0.175 * 0.5  +  0.175 * 1.525 * 0.5  +  1.525 * 0.525 * 0.5  +  0.525 * 1.775 * 0.5 1.155 So shifting to get an average of 0 does not work.  My question: What would I shift by instead so that the resulting polygon has the same area as the original polygon? EDIT: joriki provided a solid answer to this question that was akin to normalizing a vector.  Unfortunately, this technique involves calculating the area of the resulting polygon, which becomes a bottleneck in software implementation (I am solving this problem each frame for a number of regular polygons of n=64 each).  I can try to optimize the solution if this is the only option, but a less computationally expensive solution would be preferred.",,"['geometry', 'area']"

This inspires the following manipulations: $$\frac{1}{2\sin(73)} * \frac{\sin(51-\theta)}{\sin(\theta)} = 1$$ $$\frac{1}{2\cos(17)} * \frac{\sin(51)\cos(\theta)-\cos(51)\sin(\theta)}{\sin(\theta)} = 1$$ $$\sin(51)\cos(\theta)-\cos(51)\sin(\theta)= 2\cos(17)\sin(\theta) $$ $$\sin(51)\cos(\theta) = 2\cos(17)\sin(\theta) + \cos(51)\sin(\theta)$$ $$\sin(51)\cos(\theta) = \sin(\theta)(2\cos(17) + \cos(51))$$ $$\tan(\theta) = \frac{\sin(51)}{2\cos(17) + \cos(51)}$$ Proceeding with triple-angle formulae: $$\tan(\theta) = \frac{3\sin(17)-4\sin^3(17)}{2\cos(17) + 4\cos^3(17)-3\cos(17)}$$ $$\tan(\theta) = \frac{\sin(17)}{\cos(17)} * \frac{3-4\sin^2(17)}{4\cos^2(17)-1}$$ $$\tan(\theta) = \tan(17) * \frac{3-4(1-\cos^2(17))}{4\cos^2(17)-1}$$ $$\tan(\theta) = \tan(17) * \frac{4\cos^2(17)-1}{4\cos^2(17)-1}$$ $$\tan(\theta) = \tan(17)$$ We conclude that $\theta = 17$ and $\boxed{\angle BPC = 150}$ . This is simply horrific.  Is there a more elegant method?

So I would like to know how to correct this Oz distance, using the perspective parameters, in order to have the unprojected z coordinate ? And then how to compute x coordinate, from the unprojected z and from the perspective parameters ? After some readings on internet, I tried using the inverse ProjectionView matrix, or with the inverse Projection matrix, without a good result, maybe due to the fact I don't know the z value to give to these matrices. So I wonder if there is a way to solve this problem without using an inverse matrix ?

Here is what I have so far. In order to show H, G, and I are collinear, I need to show that $$\frac{AH}{HB}\cdot\frac{BI}{BC}\cdot\frac{CG}{GA}=-1$$ This is true by Menelaus's Theorem. Now, I can prove by SAS that $\Delta FJO\cong \Delta CJO$ and by ASA that $\Delta OJC\cong \Delta PJC$ . Thus, by transitivity, we have $\Delta OJC \cong \Delta PJC \cong \Delta OJF$ . Therefore, $\angle PCJ\cong\angle OFJ$ . This implies that $OF\parallel BC$ since the alternate interior angles are congruent. I know that parallel lines divide the sides of the triangle proportionally, so we get $\frac{AF}{FB}=\frac{AO}{OC}$ . Through similar procedures, I can also conclude the following: $FP \parallel AC$ which implies $\frac{BP}{PC}=\frac{BF}{FA}$ and $ME \parallel BC$ which implies $\frac{AM}{MB}=\frac{AE}{EC}$ . I also know there are three simple results from the angle bisector theorem. $$\frac{BD}{AB}=\frac{CD}{AC}$$ $$\frac{AF}{AC}=\frac{BF}{BC}$$ $$\frac{AE}{AB}=\frac{EC}{BC}$$ I also know from Ceva's Theorem that since the angle bisectors are concurrent, then $$\frac{AF}{FB}\cdot \frac{BD}{DC} \cdot \frac{CE}{EA}=1$$ Though that piece of information is not really different from the results of the angle bisector theorem.
