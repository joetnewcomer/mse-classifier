How does one derive that $\Gamma(2.7) = e^{0.434821}$?","All I know of the Gamma function is $$\Gamma(\alpha) = \int\limits_{0}^{\infty}x^{\alpha - 1}e^{-x}\text{ d}x$$ and the recursive formula $$\Gamma(\alpha) = (\alpha-1)\Gamma(\alpha - 1)\text{.}$$ A friend asked me to try to find $\Gamma(2.7)$. I assume this involves complex analysis, which I have absolutely no background on (except for the basic Euler formula). Using Wolfram, I found that  $$\Gamma(2.7) = e^{0.434821}$$ which suggests to me perhaps writing out $e^{-x}$ as a Taylor series: $$\Gamma(\alpha) = \int\limits_{0}^{\infty}x^{\alpha - 1}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{\infty}\dfrac{(-x)^{i}}{i!}\text{ d}x$$ but alas, this doesn't look helpful.

This means that $$ \oint_C u\,\mathrm{d}s = \frac{1}{i} \oint_C v $$ What I want to say is that both line integrals are reall, so the left handside  is imaginary and the right handside is real. My argument for this is that both $u$ and $v$ lives in $C^\infty$ and hence has no singularities in $\mathbb{C}$. Is this correct? Is there any better argument that both integrals are real? Assume that the integrals are real, then the only possibility for the equation to hold is if both integrals are zero. if we take $C$ to be the unit circle, then we can parametrize the integral over u  $$ \oint_{|z|=1} u\,\mathrm{d}s = \int_0^{2\pi} u(e^{i \theta})|i e^{i \theta}| \mathrm{d}\theta = \int_0^{2\pi} h(\theta)\,\mathrm{d}\theta = 0 $$  Not quite sure how I should parametrize the integral such that it becomes real.

Problem 2 Let $u(x,y) = x e^x \cos y - y e^x \sin y $ a) Show that u is harmonic in the entire plane b) Find a function $v$ such that $f = u + i v$ is analytic c) Show that $$\int_0^{2\pi} \cos \theta e^{\cos\theta} \cos(\sin \theta) - \sin \theta e^{\cos\theta} \sin(\sin \theta)\,\mathrm{d}\theta=0$$ For a) one can note that $\text{Re}(ze^z) = u(x,y)$, hence $u$ is harmonic. Or show that $\nabla^2 u(x,y)=\partial u = \partial^2u/\partial x^2 + \partial^2 u/\partial x^2  =0$. Part b) can be found by either taking $v=\text{Im}(z e^z) =e^x(x\sin y+y\cos y)$, or integrate the Cauchy-Riemann equations. I have two ""proofs"" for c) and I am quite unsure about the finer works in both of them. Note that if $h(\theta)$ denotes the integrand then $u(\cos \theta,\sin \theta)=h(\theta)$. We know that there exists a function $f$ such that $f = u + iv$, and $f$ is analytic. The path integral over some closed curve is zero, over an analytic function. So the following should hold $$ \oint_C f\,\mathrm{d}s = \oint_C u\,\mathrm{d}s + i \oint_C v\,\mathrm{d}s = 0\,, $$ where $C$ is some closed curve. This means that $$ \oint_C u\,\mathrm{d}s = \frac{1}{i} \oint_C v $$ What I want to say is that both line integrals are reall, so the left handside  is imaginary and the right handside is real.
