19,The Making of a Ring — How can we choose 1?,The Making of a Ring — How can we choose 1?,,"I am an undergraduate studying Algebra: Chapter 0 by Paolo Aluffi in my free time (Note that because of this whenever I refer to 'rings' I am speaking of 'rings with identity'). While learning about the basics of rings, it became clear to me that we define multiplication by associativity and distributivity because these are the properties of group homomorphisms. Ring multiplication distributes over addition in the underlying abelian group because of the homomorphism condition—i.e. for a group homomorphism $\varphi: G \to G$ , we have $\varphi(a+b) = \varphi(a) + \varphi(b)$ . Similarly the associativity of multiplication is due to the associative nature of morphism composition. Therefore it seems natural to me to view the multiplication operation as a convenient abstraction encapsulating the data we obtain by studying an abelian group alongside its group endomorphisms. Aluffi brings as Proposition 2.7 the following: Let $R$ be a ring. Then the function $r \mapsto \lambda_r$ [where $\lambda_r$ is the group endomorphism representing left ring multiplication by $r$ ] is an injective ring homomorphism $$\lambda: R \to \mathrm{End}_{\mathrm{Ab}}(R).$$ (Algebra: Chapter 0, §III.2.5) Thus the image of $\lambda$ is a subring of $\mathrm{End}_{\mathrm{Ab}}(R)$ isomporphic to $R$ . If we can pick $\mathrm{im} \ \lambda$ out of $\mathrm{End}_{\mathrm{Ab}}(R)$ without a predefined ring structure, we can obtain a ring structure on $R$ using an isomorphism $\mathrm{im} \ \lambda \to R$ given by $\lambda_r \mapsto \lambda_r(1_R)$ . So given an abelian group $G$ and an element designated $``1_G""$ , I think that we need only to study how a certain subgroup of $\mathrm{End}_{\mathrm{Ab}}(G)$ interacts with $1_G$ to determine a ring structure on $G$ . Therefore my question is: What are the precise consequences of differing choices of $1$ when defining a ring structure on an abelian group? My thoughts on this so far: Clearly different choices of $1$ lead to different ring structures. If, for example, we let $G := (\mathbb{Z}\backslash 4\mathbb{Z}, +)$ , the natural choice of $1_G$ being 1 gives rise to a ring of characteristic $4$ . Now, I struggled to actually carry out this example, but we can easily imagine that if we could choose $1_G$ to be 2, then the induced ring would be of characteristic 2, since $2 + 2 = 2 \cdot 1_G = 0$ . Furthermore, since 3 is the additive inverse of 1 in this group, we should be able to let $1_G = 3$ and come up with a sort of 'backwards' version of the usual ring structure. In this case we have a ring with $G$ as the underlying abelian group, isomorphic to the version with $1_G = 1$ and multiplication defined by: $\ast$ 3 2 1 3 3 2 1 2 2 0 2 1 1 2 3 So is every element of an arbitrary abelian group $G$ a candidate for $1_G$ when defining a ring structure? If so, what are the consequences of different choices, and if not what are the necessary group-theoretic requirements? Note: I am a beginner at this, having only studied this subject independently throughout my senior year of highschool and freshman year of college. With that in mind please let me know if anything I said is off-base and try to explain things as simply as possible.

The understanding problem arises in the verification of the case when $M$ is finite (as $A$ -module). The proof works as follows: Choose a minimal $A$ -basis $\omega_1,...,\omega_n$ of $M$ . Take into account that ""minimal"" means that there cannot exist another system of generators $b_1,..., b_m \in M$ with $m < n$ and $M = \sum_{i=1} ^m A b_i$ .

63,Structure of simple group of order 168 just via Sylow theory (fix for Math Doctor Bob),Structure of simple group of order 168 just via Sylow theory (fix for Math Doctor Bob),,"There are a lot of questions on here about the simple group of order 168, e.g., this , this , this , this , this , this , and this . There is also plenty of info on the internet about this group, e.g., this . I am about to ask something very specific that I think is different from these, but please let me know if I've missed something. A student of mine recently showed me this pair of videos ( part 1 , part 2 ) by Robert Donley (aka Math Doctor Bob ), which attempts to derive the number and structure of the Sylow subgroups of the simple group of 168, along with its class equation, using only Sylow theory, the classification of groups of order 8, and elementary counting arguments. I buy the arguments in the first video, but the second video seems to me to contain a significant gap in reasoning. My question is about how to patch the reasoning in the video using only the types of tools used in the video. (The closest thing I could find was these notes , which use the same types of tools and obtain the same results, but what I want is specifically to rescue Donley's argument itself.) Here are the details: Up til about 2m,15s into the second video, the argument has established that: There are 8 Sylow 7-subgroups, for a total of 48 elements of order 7. There are 28 Sylow 3-subgroups, for a total of 56 elements of order 3, and they are all conjugate. There are no elements of orders 6 or 14. At this point, Donley turns attention to the Sylow 2-subgroups, arguing first that they are nonabelian, and then using this to conclude that there are 21 of them and they are self-normalizing, and proceeding from there to use counting arguments to deduce that they are isomorphic to $D_4$ . His argument that they are nonabelian appears to me to have a big gap. Donley says, consider one Sylow 2-subgroup; call it $H_8$ . Look at its order 2 elements. If $H_8=C_2^3$ , there are 7 of them; let a Sylow 3-subgroup act by conjugation (this claim is what I have a problem with); since $3\nmid 7$ , there is a singleton orbit, so an order 2 element is centralized by an order 3 element, and there is an order 6 element, contradiction. If $H_8=C_4\times C_2$ , he lets a Sylow 7-subgroup act and concludes in the same way (since $7\nmid 3$ ) that there is a singleton orbit and thus an element of order 14. If $H_8=C_8$ , he lets either one act because there is only one element of order 2. My objection is that you can't let a Sylow 3-subgroup act on the order 2 elements in a specific Sylow 2-subgroup unless you have already established, or are at least explicitly provisionally assuming, that the Sylow 2 normalizer contains a Sylow 3. (And similarly for a Sylow 7 in place of a Sylow 3.) In fact, Donley concludes shortly thereafter that the Sylow 2's are self-normalizing, by reasoning that the nonabelian groups of order 8 each have a center of order 2, thus a factor of 3 or 7 dividing the order of the Sylow 2 normalizer would imply an order 2 element centralized by an order 3 or 7 element, and thus an element of order 6 or 14, so the Sylow 2 normalizer's order must only be divisible by 2. So he wants to conclude this is actually false; it certainly shouldn't be assumed implicitly. What I would like to ask your help with is reorganizing just this specific part of the argument, beginning from bulleted information above, to obtain the conclusion that the Sylow 2 is nonabelian. I see how to do it using more powerful tools (specifically, Burnside's transfer theorem ), but I would like to see how to do it using only Sylow theory, the classification of groups of order 8, and counting. If it requires to access information about the structure of $S_4$ , that's fine too. Really I'm thinking in terms of what my student knows. To begin with, I think it's better tactically to consider the number of Sylow 2's before asking about their structure, since this controls whether they are normalized by Sylow 3's etc. Therefore, I think the argument should begin: The number of Sylow 2's is, by Sylow theory, either 1, 3, 7 or 21. It can't be 1 because the group is simple, and similarly 3 can be ruled out because this would imply a nontrivial (and therefore injective, by simplicity) homomorphism to $S_3$ , which is impossible because $168>6$ . So there are 7 or 21 Sylow 2's. Suppose there are 7. Then the Sylow 2 normalizer is order 24, and it contains a Sylow 3, which therefore acts on the Sylow 2. Now Donley's exact reasoning can be used to rule out the cases that $H_8$ is isomorphic to $C_2^3$ , $C_8$ , $D_4$ , or $Q_8$ , and a minor adjustment can be used to rule out $C_4\times C_2$ . Specifically, $C_2^3$ has 7 elements of order 2, so (since $3\nmid 7$ ) the action on these has a fixed point, and Donley's exact reasoning then yields an element of order 6, a contradiction. Meanwhile, all four of $C_4\times C_2$ , $C_8$ , $D_4$ , and $Q_8$ have a characteristic subgroup of order 2, so this too is a fixed point, leading to the same contradiction. (For $C_4\times C_2$ , it's generated by the unique order 2 element that is a square. For the other three, it was identified by Donley, see above: the unique subgroup of order 2 in $C_8$ , and the centers of $D_4$ and $Q_8$ .) These contradictions now rule out the possibility that there are 7 Sylow 2's; there must be 21, and they must be self-normalizing. The real question I have is: From here, how do we conclude that the Sylow 2's are not abelian? Donley's line of argumentation is a nonstarter because we know that the Sylow 3's and Sylow 7's do not act on a Sylow 2. The high-tech answer is the Burnside transfer theorem. If $H_8$ is abelian and self-normalizing, then certainly it is central in its normalizer, and the Burnside transfer theorem then gives us a normal 2-complement, which is impossible since the group is simple. But how would you do it using only Sylow theory, the classification of groups of order 8, counting, and, if you need it, the structure of $S_4$ ?

If not, can we add $N$ of finite rank to get a positive answer ? 4) Let $M$ be finitely generated by $f_1, \ldots, f_n$, and $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ be a linear independent family in $M$. Is $M$ free?

98,When is an element of a free module over a principal ideal domain contained in a basis?,When is an element of a free module over a principal ideal domain contained in a basis?,,"I'm trying to show the following: Let $R$ be a principal ideal domain and let $M$ be free $R$-module of rank $n$. Let $Y=\{y_1,\ldots,y_n\}$ be a basis of $M$ and $x\in M$ with $x=y_1a_1+\cdots+y_na_n$. Then $x$ is contained in a base of $M$ if and only if $\gcd(a_1,\ldots,a_n)=1$. I have shown that if $x$ belongs to a basis of $M$, then $\gcd(a_1,\ldots,a_n)=1$. This is my idea for the other direction: If $n=1$, then $a_1\in R^*$, and we are done. Now suppose $n\geq 2$. Since $\gcd(a_1,\ldots,a_n)=1$, there are $s_1,\ldots,s_n\in R$ such that $a_1s_1+\cdots+a_ns_n=1$, then using this equality I tried to get some non-zero $y\in M$ such that $\langle x\rangle\cap \langle y\rangle=0$. Supposing the existence of such $y$,  using Zorn's lemma you can get a maximal nonzero submodule $N$ such that $\langle x\rangle\cap N=0$, then I showed that $\langle x\rangle\oplus N=M$, and since $M$ is free and $R$ a principal ideal domain $N$ is free and has a basis $\{x_1,\ldots,x_m\}$, and thus $\{x,x_1,\ldots,x_m\}$ would be a basis of $M$. My question is: is there such an $y$? Also, I would like to know whether this idea is too complicated, and if so, I want to know alternative approaches to it.

Prove that every finite dimensional extension of $E$ is cyclic. Well, this is my attempt of proof: First I prove that one can restrict himself to a finite Galois extensions.

If not then $[F:E(v)]\leq r$, and we have that $F$ is Galois over $E(v)$ (fundamental theorem), therefore the induction hypothesis shows that $Aut_{E(v)}F$ is cyclic. The fact that $E(v)$ is Galois over $E$ implies that $Aut_{E(v)}F$ is normal in $Aut_E F$ and again by the fundamental theorem $Aut_E E(v)=Aut_E F/Aut_{E(v)}F$. At this point I had been thinking about a proposition of the form ""If a finite group G contains a normal cyclic subgroup such that the quotient $G/N$ is also cyclic then G is cyclic""; which is false, even if one replace normal cyclic, for maximal normal cyclic, and things like this.
