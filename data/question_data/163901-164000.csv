We use (c) to prove that $E$ is uncountable. So, let $x \in \Omega$ . Define a sequence $(x_n)_n$ by a diagonal argument: Define $x_0:= x+1$ $x_1 \in E_1, x_2 \in E_2, x_3 \in E_1, x_4 \in E_2, x_5 \in E_3, x_6 \in E_1, x_7 \in E_2, x_8 \in E_3, x_9 \in E_4, x_{10}\in E_1$ and continue.

By construction thus $y:=\lim_n x_n \geq x_0 =x+1> x $ . Also, all subsequences of $(x_n)$ converge to $x$ so  since $(x_n)_n$ contains subsequences consisting entirely from terms of each $E_n$ , we see that $y=\lim_n x_n \in \overline{E_n} = E_n$ for all $n$ and hence $y \in E$ , as desired.

5,Counterexample in Fubini's Theorem (non-integrable function),Counterexample in Fubini's Theorem (non-integrable function),,"Fubini's theorem tells us that (for measurable functions on a product of $σ$ -finite measure spaces) if the integral of the absolute value is finite, then the order of integration does not matter Here is a counterexample that shows why you can't drop the assumption that the original function is integrable in Fubini's theorem: A simple example to show that the repeated integrals can be different in general is to take the two measure spaces to be the positive integers, and to take the function $f(x,y)$ to be $1$ if $x=y$ , $−1$ if $x=y+1$ , and $0$ otherwise. Then the two repeated integrals have different values $0$ and $1$ . Can somebody explain why the original function is not integrable and then show me how the two iterated integrals are not equal? Here is my attempt at understanding this: Let $\mathbb{Z}_1$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ be the two measure spaces, with (I assume?) to be a counting measure. Then apparently it's true that: $$\int_{\mathbb{Z}_2} \int_{\mathbb{Z}_1}f^y(x)\,dx\,dy \neq \int_{\mathbb{Z}_1} \int_{\mathbb{Z}_2}f_x(y)\,dy\,dx $$ But it seems like $$\int_{\mathbb{Z}_1}f^y(x)\,dx=\int_{\mathbb{Z}_2}f_x(y)\,dy=0$$ So therefore both sides of the integral, no matter which order, will equal $0$ . It seems like $\int_{\mathbb{Z}_1}f^y(x)dx=0$ because there are only two values of $x$ where this integral is going to be nonzero, once when it's $-1$ and once when it's $1$ . The same argument seems to apply if we integrate with respect to $dy$ first. What am I doing wrong here? Furthermore, why is the original functions absolute value is not finite?

Construct a measurable set $E\subset [0,1]$ such that for any   non-empty open sub-interval $I$ in $[0,1]$ , both sets $E\cap I$ and $E^c\cap I$ have positive measure. [Stein's Hint: For the first part, consider a Cantor-like set of positive measure, and add in each of the intervals that are omitted in the first step of its construction, another Cantor-like set. Continue this procedure indefinitely.] So I tried using the hint to construct the desired set, but I must be misunderstanding something because I do not think the construction works. My Thoughts: I believe the basic idea is that we generate a Cantor-like set $C_1$ by removing repeatedly open intervals of some appropriate length at each stage of the construction starting from $[0,1]$ . Then as said in the hint, at the first step in the construction we removed centrally some open interval $I_1$ from $[0,1]$ . Then we generate another Cantor-like set $C_2$ from $I_1$ . During the first stage of $C_2$ 's construction we removed $I_2$ from $I_1$ . Repeat indefinitely... My problem with this is that during the second stage of the construction of $C_1$ , we removed $2$ open intervals, call one of them $\mathcal{I}$ , from $[0,1]\setminus I_1$ . If we take the union of all these Cantor-like sets, denote it as $E$ , then wouldn't $E\cap \mathcal{I}=\emptyset$ ? If true, then it seems we would have to apply this to all the open intervals that $C_1$ removes and generate a collection of Cantor-like sets from them. Each of which would need the same procedure done to them. This doesn't seem correct to me and we may need to define $E$ as the countable union of countable unions of Cantor-like sets. Any help thinking correctly about this problem would be much appreciated. Note : It's proven (I've proved) that the Cantor-like sets Stein is talking about have positive measure (Exercise 4 in Stein).","This question already has an answer here : Construct a Borel set on R such that it intersect every open interval with non-zero non-""full"" measure (1 answer) Closed 5 years ago .

[Stein's Hint: For the first part, consider a Cantor-like set of positive measure, and add in each of the intervals that are omitted in the first step of its construction, another Cantor-like set. Continue this procedure indefinitely.] So I tried using the hint to construct the desired set, but I must be misunderstanding something because I do not think the construction works. My Thoughts: I believe the basic idea is that we generate a Cantor-like set by removing repeatedly open intervals of some appropriate length at each stage of the construction starting from . Then as said in the hint, at the first step in the construction we removed centrally some open interval from . Then we generate another Cantor-like set from . During the first stage of 's construction we removed from . Repeat indefinitely... My problem with this is that during the second stage of the construction of , we removed open intervals, call one of them , from . If we take the union of all these Cantor-like sets, denote it as , then wouldn't ? If true, then it seems we would have to apply this to all the open intervals that removes and generate a collection of Cantor-like sets from them. Each of which would need the same procedure done to them. This doesn't seem correct to me and we may need to define as the countable union of countable unions of Cantor-like sets. Any help thinking correctly about this problem would be much appreciated. Note : It's proven (I've proved) that the Cantor-like sets Stein is talking about have positive measure (Exercise 4 in Stein).","E\subset [0,1] I [0,1] E\cap I E^c\cap I C_1 [0,1] I_1 [0,1] C_2 I_1 C_2 I_2 I_1 C_1 2 \mathcal{I} [0,1]\setminus I_1 E E\cap \mathcal{I}=\emptyset C_1 E","['real-analysis', 'measure-theory', 'lebesgue-measure']"

Because the asker above said they proved it by contradiction, that is what I'm attempting. But I'm having issues wrapping my brain around the concept of set measurability. So let's give it a good college try with what I can understand. For clarity, $\mu$ is an outer measure. A is nonmeasurable, so $\exists B \subseteq X$ such that $\mu (B) \ne \mu (B \bigcap A) + (B \bigcap A^c)$. E is measurable, so $\mu (B) = \mu (B \bigcap E) + (B \bigcap E^c)$. This essentially means $\mu (B) \ge \mu (B \bigcap E) + (B \bigcap E^c)$ (Since monotonicity is alredy implied by the definition of outer measure). So we can attempt a proof (or the start of one) by contradiction. Assume $\mu (E \setminus A)=0$. So $E \setminus A$ is a null set. So $\mu (B) \ge \mu (B \bigcap E) + (B \bigcap E^c)$. I assume I'm supposed to show a contradiction using that A is nonmeasurable. I'm unsure how. Another way I think could work would be to use: $\mu (E \setminus A)= \mu (E \bigcap A^c) = 0$ and arrive at a contradiction given that A is nonmeasurable, but again, I'm unsure how. I just need some direction from here. Thank you in advance for any advice.",,"['real-analysis', 'measure-theory']"

If $f_n\rightarrow f$ monotone increasing and for almost all $x\in D$ then $\int_Ef_n dx\rightarrow \int_E f$ for every measurable set $E$. So, this theorem is also valid for not complete measurable spaces but then we must have $f_n\rightarrow f$ for all $x\in D$. I can not read from the prove why this is true. Can someone explain?",,"['real-analysis', 'integration', 'measure-theory', 'lebesgue-integral']"
99,If we take $f$ be integrable function then can we prove $\int_{\Bbb R} f(x)\cos(nx)dx \to 0$ as $n \to \infty$,If we take  be integrable function then can we prove  as,f \int_{\Bbb R} f(x)\cos(nx)dx \to 0 n \to \infty,In Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma i.e http://kurser.math.su.se/pluginfile.php/15735/mod_resource/content/1/RiemannLebesgueVretblad.pdf in this link If we take $f$ to be an (improperly) integrable function then can we prove $\int_{\Bbb R} f(x)\cos(nx)dx \to 0$ as $n \to \infty$? Note here $f$ is not absolutely convergent. I am thinking that we will have a problem when we move to unboundedness of $\mathbb R$ otherwise in a compact subset of $\mathbb R$ we will not have any problem. But I can't find any counter-example.,In Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma i.e http://kurser.math.su.se/pluginfile.php/15735/mod_resource/content/1/RiemannLebesgueVretblad.pdf in this link If we take $f$ to be an (improperly) integrable function then can we prove $\int_{\Bbb R} f(x)\cos(nx)dx \to 0$ as $n \to \infty$?
