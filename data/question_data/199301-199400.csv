What is $V$, and why does a connection on $P$ induce a connection on $V$ (or am I missing that $V$ is associated not only to a cover of $P$ as above, but to $P$ itself)?

If I'm not mistaken, when you proceed by defining smooth maps between manifolds in the usual way, you end up with a category which is at least equivalent to the usual  category.

Then, $g$ has expression $$ g = (1 + x^{2}) dx \otimes dx - x dx \otimes dy - x dy \otimes dx + dy \otimes dy.$$ Easily, we can compute the Christoffel symbols of the Levi-Civita connection. The only non-zero symbol is $\Gamma_{11}^{2} = -1$ . Then, $G$ has constant sectional curvature $K = 0$ , as the Euclidean plane $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ . Now, are $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and $G$ isometric Riemannian manifolds? I know that if two Riemannian manifolds have  different sectional curvatures in corresponding points, they cannot be isometric but, this not the case. Should I try to find conditions for the existence of such isometry? Thanks in advance.

Then $\gamma^{-1} \mathcal F$ is a local system on $I$ and thus constant. Furthermore, the stalks of a inverse image sheaf are given as $$(\gamma^{-1} \mathcal F)_t = \mathcal F_{\gamma(t)}.$$ As for a constant sheaf the restriction map from global sections to stalks is an isomorphism, we get an isomorphism $$\mathcal F_{x_0} = (\gamma^{-1} \mathcal F)_0 \simeq \Gamma(\gamma^{-1} \mathcal F, I) \simeq (\gamma^{-1} \mathcal F)_1 =  \mathcal F_{x_0}. $$ Why does this isomorphism only depend on the homotpy class of $\gamma$ ?

Then again, $H^{-1} \mathcal F$ is a constant sheaf, and we obtain isomorphisms $$\mathcal F_{x_0} = (H^{-1} \mathcal F)_{(0,0)} \simeq \Gamma(H^{-1} \mathcal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    F, I^2) \simeq (H^{-1} \mathcal F)_{(1,0)}= \mathcal F_{x_0}$$ and $$\mathcal F_{x_0} = (H^{-1} \mathcal F)_{(0,0)} \simeq \Gamma(H^{-1} \mathcal F, I^2) \simeq (H^{-1} \mathcal F)_{(0,1)}= \mathcal F_{x_0}.$$ I need to show that one of the isomorphisms above is the identity and the other is the one given by $\gamma$ .","I want to understand, why local systems (= locally constant sheafs) with values in a vector space define a monodromy representation .

Assume $x$ is one to one. Then ${\bf x}^{-1}$ is continuous. Definition 1 is: A subset $S \subset R^2$ is a regular surface if, for each $p \in S$ , there exists a neighborhood $V$ in $R^3$ and a map ${\bf x}: U \rightarrow V \cap S$ of an open set $U$ in $R^2$ such that: 1) ${\bf x}$ is differentiable. 2) ${\bf x}$ is a homeomorphism. 3) For each $q \in U$ , the differential $d{\bf x}_q : R^2 \rightarrow R^3$ is one to one. Essentially they claim that the continuity of the inverse map is automatic once other conditions are satisfied once we know that $S$ is already a surface. But I do not see how they make use of the fact that $S$ is a surface anywhere in the proof.

From what I understand, $F_{*,p}$ maps $X_p$ to an element in $T_{F(p)} M$ , the tangent space of the manifold M at $F(p)$ .

Would it be the case that $F_{*,p}(X_p)f = \frac{d}{dt} \big|_0 (f \circ F \circ c)(t)$ ?

I'm  doing computations to determine invariant properties of the quantity $X\circ Y= \nabla_Y X$ where $X$ and $Y$ are vector fields,  when we change coordinate choices (when $\nabla$ is a flat torsion-free connection). So naturally, we start with the simplest case, $\mathbb{R}$ with its usual connection. However we encounter the following problem. Start with vector fields $X=f(x)dx$ and $Y=g(x)dx.$ We have $X\circ Y = g(x)\frac{df}{dx}dx.$ We then make a general change of coordinates $\phi(y)=x.$ So $X=f(\phi(y))\frac{d\phi}{dy}dy$ and $Y=g(\phi (y))\frac{d\phi}{dy}dy.$ Then $X \circ' Y = g(\phi(y))\frac{d\phi}{dy}(\frac{df(\phi(y))}{d \phi}\frac{d \phi}{dy}+f(\phi(y))\frac{d^2\phi}{d y^2})dy$ in the new coordinates.

Conjecture: There exists an open neighbourhood $S'$ of $\bar S$ which is also strongly convex. New question (March 20): It seems like the conjecture is false in general and user Dap has suggested a counterexample as an answer. Can you find another counterexample, maybe a simpler one? Some remarks and proof attempts: For sets which are merely convex this is not true. For example an open  hemisphere of $S^2$ cannot be enlarged without losing convexity. The strongly convex sets of $S^2$ on the other hand have their closure strictly contained in a hemisphere and thus can obviously be enlarged to a new strongly convex set. This picture (respectively the ones that I can image on other surfaces) leads me to the assumption that the question has a positive answer. Strongly convex sets are totally normal, (i.e. for every point $p\in S$ there is an open set $V\subset T_pM$ such that $\exp_p\colon V\rightarrow S$ is a diffeomorphism). My first idea was to first find an $S''\supset \bar S$ totally normal and then try to restict it to a strictly convex set. But just working with total normality cannot work: $S^2 \backslash p_0$ is totally normal, but cannot be extended to a larger totally normal set. Unfortunately I don't know how strong convexity can be incorporated from the start. Edit (March 17): Here is a false counterexample, that was posted as an (now deleted) answer. I find it interesting neverletheless: Let $M=\{(x,y)\vert y>-e^x\}\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ and $S$ the open upper half plane (which is only convex and not strongly convex).
