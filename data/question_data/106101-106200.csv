I'm asked to prove there are 6 projectivities between $\mathbb{P_1} \longrightarrow \mathbb{P_1}$ and giving the equations. This is what I thought about it. As long as there is 2 classes in $\mathbb{Z/2Z}$ and four points to determine the projectivity, we can combine them in 7 ways, acording to the condition $ad - bc \neq 0$ : $(0,1,1,1)$ , $(1,0,1,1)$ , $(1,1,0,1)$ , $(1,1,1,0)$ , $(0,1,1,0)$ , $(1,0,0,1)$ .

7,Dividing a disk of diameter 1 into pieces of smaller diameter,Dividing a disk of diameter 1 into pieces of smaller diameter,,"Let $F$ be an arbitrary bounded set on the plane, $n \in \mathbb{N}$ .

Clearly, $f$ seems to be playing the role of $\phi$ , our transformation, and the original function that we want to integrate is now called $g$ .

12,Geometric Motivation for Inner Product,Geometric Motivation for Inner Product,,"I think some background will make the kind of answer I'm looking for clearer. I'm trying to think of an elementary proof of the Pythagorean Theorem. I don't like the geometric proofs because they all seem to rely on some kind of trick or clever construction. In particular, they don't seem to shed any light on why we look at the square root of the sum of squares to find a distance. By contrast, the inner product seems like an elementary way to prove the Pythagorean theorem that does give us some understanding of why we should square and take square roots. Briefly: you use Gram-Schmidt to convert a basis to an orthonormal basis. Taking the inner product of a vector with itself in the orthonormal basis immediately gives you the Pythagorean theorem. This seems like a promising approach since the defining properties of an inner product (linearity, symmetry, and positive definitenes) are pretty basic. But, even though they're basic, I'm not sure how to motivate them geometrically. So, at the level of geometry, why should we want to consider an object like an inner product on a vector space? Of course, we know by Cauchy-Schwarz that the inner product helps us define magnitude and angle, but I don't think that's obvious from its defining properties. Perhaps the thing to do is to start with the relationship $\langle v, w \rangle = ||v || ||w|| \cos \theta$ , where $\theta$ is the angle between $w$ and $v$ , and then argue that $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$ has the properties of an inner product.","I think some background will make the kind of answer I'm looking for clearer.

Perhaps the thing to do is to start with the relationship , where is the angle between and , and then argue that has the properties of an inner product.","\langle v, w \rangle = ||v || ||w|| \cos \theta \theta w v \langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle","['geometry', 'inner-products', 'motivation', 'gram-schmidt']"

22,Distance between points maximally distributed on n-dimensional unit sphere?,Distance between points maximally distributed on n-dimensional unit sphere?,,"This problem arose in some of my own personal data science research and I am wondering if anyone has encountered this before. Consider $k$ points that lie on an $n$ -dimensional unit sphere such that all pairs of points are as far apart as possible. Is there a closed-form solution to finding this distance? First I tried solving it in a simpler case of a 2-dimensional sphere, i.e a circle. In this case, the problem reduces to finding the length of one side of a regular polygon inscribed in a unit circle. Using some simple trigonometry we can derive a formula for the length of one side of this polygon: $$d = 2 \sin \frac{\pi}{k}$$ where $d$ is the distance between any pair of points and $k$ is the number of points. So in 2-dimensions, this is the furthest distance between any two points on a unit circle such that all pairs of points are the same distance apart. It seems that one could similarly solve this in 3-dimensions by inscribing solids inside the sphere and finding their side lengths, though I am unsure of how to approach this, let alone $n$ -dimensions.

24,"Game on the unit segment, $n$ players (points).","Game on the unit segment,  players (points).",n,"The $n$ player 1-dimensional unit game The $n\ge 2$ players take turns placing their own point on the unit segment $[0,1]$ . (Hence, 1-dimensional .) The closest distance they can place their point to someone elses placed point is some small $\varepsilon\gt 0$ . A player owns the part of the segment closest to their own point. The goal is to own the largest part of the segment. That is, say $a,b$ are closest points to your own point $x$ . Then: If your point ends up between two points $x\in(a,b)$ then your score is $s_x=\frac12(b-a)$ . If your point ends up in $x\in[0,a)$ , then your score is $s_x=\frac12 (x+a)$ . Symmetrically, if your point $x\in(b,1]$ , then your score is $s_x=1-\frac12 (x+b)$ . Which player(s) have the winning strategy? (Have highest chance of highest score, then maximize that score.) WLOG (Symmetry) first player plays in $x_1\in[0,\frac12]$ . I've observed so far that the optimal play (and winniners) should be: $(n=2)-$ Is a win for the $1$ st player. Player plays $x_1=\frac12$ . $(n=3)-$ Is a win for either $1$ st or $2$ nd player (coin flip). Players play $x_1=\frac14+\frac12\varepsilon$ and $x_2=1-x_1$ , then $x_3\in(x_1,x_2)$ uniformly randomly (we assume if a player is presented with equally good choices, he picks uniformly randomly), which results in $0.5$ chance (a coin flip) for the one of the $x_1,x_2$ to win (have highest score). More details are below. Do correct me if I missed anything about $(n=3)$ there. Can we find strategies and winners for $n\ge 4$ ? $2$ -player case is a win for $1$ st player For $n=2$ , it is not hard to see that the first player has a winning strategy by playing $x_1=\frac12$ . The most the second player can score then is by playing $x_2=\frac12-\varepsilon$ . This nets them $s_2=\frac12 (\frac12-\varepsilon+\frac12)=\frac12-\frac12\varepsilon$ score, while the first player now has $s_1=\frac12+\frac12\varepsilon$ . $3$ -player case is a win for either $1$ st or $2$ nd player with $0.5$ probability For $n=3$ , this strategy does not work for the first player anymore. The third player would play $x_3=\frac12+\varepsilon$ . (Mirror the second player.) The second and third player now share the win by both having $\frac12-\frac12\varepsilon$ score. The first player is now in $x_1\in(x_2,x_3)$ and their score is reduced to a minimal $\varepsilon$ . So WLOG if in $n=3$ the winning strategy exists for the first player, they will play in $x_1\in[0,\frac12)$ . Now the question is, what would be the optimal response of the second player to this? The first player plays $x_1=\frac12-\delta$ . Assuming $\delta$ is small enough, the second player can play $x_2=\frac12+\delta+\varepsilon$ to win the game. Notice that this play makes $[0,x_1)$ more favorable for the third player, than the $(x_2,1]$ , meaning the third player would leech off the first player. That is, by small $\delta$ we are assuming that the score $s_3$ of $x_3$ if they would play in $x_3\in(x_1,x_2)$ is smaller than if they would play optimally in $[0,x_1)$ . In other words we are assuming $\delta \lt \frac14-\frac12\varepsilon$ here: $$s_3((x_1,x_2))\lt s_3([0,x_1)) \iff \delta+\frac12\varepsilon\lt \frac12-\delta-\frac12\varepsilon \iff \delta \lt \frac14 -\frac12 \varepsilon$$ This forces $x_3$ to play in $[0,x_1)$ , namely $x_3=\frac12-\delta-\varepsilon\implies s_3=\frac12-\delta-\frac12\varepsilon$ . The score of the second player will be $s_2=\frac12-\frac12\varepsilon$ , and the first player will have $s_1=\delta+\varepsilon$ . We have $s_1\lt s_3 \lt s_2$ . This now gives a winning strategy for second player if $x_1\in(\frac14+\frac12\varepsilon,\frac12]$ . So WLOG if in $n=3$ the winning strategy exists for the first player, they will play in $x_1\in[0,\frac14+\frac12\varepsilon]$ . If $x_1=\frac14+\frac12\varepsilon$ and $x_2=(1-x_1)+\varepsilon$ still, then $x_3$ would play uniformly randomly in $x_1\in(x_1,x_2)$ for $s_3=\frac14+\varepsilon$ . This will result in $x_1$ winning with slightly larger probability than $0.5$ (depending on the size of $\varepsilon$ ), and other times $x_2$ will win. Can $x_2$ now change its strategy to improve its odds? If it increases the $\varepsilon$ increment, is has worse odds. (Depending on the size of the $\varepsilon$ .) If it removes it, both players $x_1,x_2$ have exactly $0.5$ chance of winning. ( $x_2$ mirrors $x_1$ ) If it decreases the $\varepsilon$ increment, is now always loses because $x_3\in(x_2,1]$ is forced. That is, for $x_1=\frac14+\frac12\varepsilon$ it seems the optimal strategy for second player is $x_2=1-x_1$ , to mirror it. This forces the $x_3$ to play uniformly randomly in $(x_1,x_2)$ , giving both $x_1,x_2$ equal chances of winning (probability $0.5$ ). The question now remains, can first player do better than $0.5$ if he picks $x\in[0,\frac14+\frac12\varepsilon)$ ? It seems that if $x_1$ plays in this interval (is closer to $0$ ), this allows the $x_2$ to decrease the mentioned increment (come closer to the $\frac12$ ) without making $(x_2,1]$ more valuable than the $(x_1,x_2)$ for the $x_3$ to play in. Hence $x_2$ has higher probability than $0.5$ of winning now. From all of these cases for $x_1$ , it follows that the optimal play would be $x_1=\frac14+\frac12\varepsilon$ , then $x_2=1-x_1$ and finally $x_3\in(x_1,x_2)$ does a coin flip to decide if it wants to steal more from $x_1$ or $x_2$ , giving the other one the win. $n\in\mathbb N$ players case Is it possible to solve this for general $n$ ?

For example, points of intersection, common chords, common tangents, etc.  A self-polar triangle for a given conic is a triangle whose edges are the polars of its vertices, and whose vertices are the poles of its edges.  It is not unique, but the common self-polar triangle of two given conics, if it exists, is unique. My question is whether there is a ruler and compass construction for the common self-polar triangle of two non-intersecting non-nested ellipses.

A `strict 2-to-1 continuous map' refers to a continuous map $f$ such that for any point $x\in D^2$ , the preimage $f^{-1}(x)$ has exactly 2 points. Actually, there are three problems. Let $D^2=\{x\in \mathbb{R}^2: |x|\leq 1\}$ . Is there any map $f: D^2\to D^2$ which is strict 2-to-1? Is there any map $f: D^2_0\to D^2_0$ which is strict 2-to-1? Where $D_0^2=\{x\in \mathbb{R}^2:|x|<1\}$ the interior of $D^2$ . This is equivalent to find 2-to-1 continuous map $\mathbb{R}^2\to \mathbb{R}^2$ . Is there any map $f: D^2\to D^2$ which is strict 2-to-1 with the restriction of $f|_{S^1}=[z\mapsto z^2]$ ? Here are some remarks. When $f$ is a covering, all the above are not true. Because there is no connected covering for a simple connected space. But ``the map having same cardinality of fibre is covering map'' is not true, consider these four maps which are not covering maps. When $f$ is holomorphism, then $f$ will map the boundary to boundary. $f$ has and only has two zeros, then $f$ will be a product of two Blahcke factors (Since such zero free function with $|f|=1$ on boundary is constant by maximal modulus principle) which is very easy to check. When $f$ is an open map, we can construct a continous map $g: D^2\to S^1$ by the following way. Let $f^{-1}(x)=\{a_1,a_2\}$ , let $b$ be the point where the line passing through $a_1$ and $a_2$ intersect with the circle $S^1$ , and define $g(x)=b^2$ . So when $f|_{S^1}=[z\mapsto z^2]$ , since now $g|_{S^1}=\operatorname{id}_{S^1}$ , it is not true by an argument of fundamental group. (Proof that $g$ is continous.) Let $$h:\underbrace{\{(x,y)\in D^2\times D^2:x\neq y\}}_{D'} \to S^1$$ be the map of ``square of intersecting $S^1$ '', so for any open subset $U\subseteq S^1$ , $$g^{-1}(U)=\{x\in D^2: \exists (a_1,a_2)\in D', x=f(a_1)=f(a_2): h(a_1,a_2)\in U\}=(f\times f)(h^{-1}(U))$$ is open, so $g$ is continous.  I think this is a right direction, but without the open map assumption, $g$ may not be continous. If we change $D^2$ by $D^1$ , it is easy --- a mathmatical analysis exercise using argument of extreme value. It is very `topological', since whether there exists a 2-to-1 map are highly depends on the topological properties of space. And I guess the answer should not be true (at least the last one).

EDIT: This is wrong and lead me to wrong conclusions. The isosceles triangle minimizes, not maximizes, the perimeter! As a result, the point on the line which maximizes the perimeter is the furthest away point of intersection with the border of the square.
