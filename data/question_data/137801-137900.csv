4,Alternative solution methods for $y''(x) = e^{y(x)}$,Alternative solution methods for,y''(x) = e^{y(x)},"Some time ago I came across the following odd looking ODE as an exercise in a textbook. I can't seem to find the source. $$ \begin{equation} \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = e^{y(x)}  \end{equation} $$ Here $y$ is some function of $x$ , I don't think any conditions on $y$ were stated. I've looked around for other stack posts on this but haven't found one. If this has been discussed before I'd be happy for someone to link me to another post. The only way I thought of to solve this was to introduce a bunch of substitutions and reduce the order of the ODE. Can anyone else think of another method to solve this? I guess we are dealing with a non-linear ODE so maybe slick solutions are not to be expected. My method is as follows. First let $u=e^{y(x)}$ $$ \begin{align} u = e^{y(x)} \implies \frac{du}{dx} = e^y \frac{dy}{dx}\,, \quad \frac{d^2u}{dx^2}= e^y \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + e^y \Big(\frac{dy}{dx}\Big)^2 \end{align} $$ Rearranging we have $$ \begin{equation} \frac{dy}{dx}= \frac{1}{u}\frac{du}{dx}\,, \quad \frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} = \frac{1}{u} \frac{d^2u}{dx^2}-\frac{1}{u^2}\Big(\frac{du}{dx}\Big)^2 \end{equation} $$ Now looking at our original equation \begin{align} \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} - e^{y(x)} =0 \\ \end{align} We rewrite our equation in terms of $u$ . \begin{align} \frac{1}{u} \frac{d^2u}{dx^2}-\frac{1}{u^2}\Big(\frac{du}{dx}\Big)^2 - u &=0 \end{align} Now notice that the dependent varible $x$ does not appear in the equation above. We can introduce a new variable $\alpha$ and use the chain rule to reduce the order to get a first order ODE. let $\alpha = \frac{du}{dx}$ $$ \begin{align} \frac{d\alpha}{dx} = \frac{d^2u}{dx^2} = \frac{d \alpha}{du} \frac{d u}{dx} = \alpha \frac{d\alpha}{du}  \end{align} $$ Skipping some algebra our main ODE becomes $$ \begin{equation} \frac{\alpha}{u}\frac{d \alpha}{du} - \Big(\frac{\alpha}{u}\Big)^2 - u =0 \end{equation} $$ Letting $k = \frac{\alpha}{u}$ and doing some more tedious algebra we have a nice simplification. \begin{equation} k \frac{dk}{du} = 1 \end{equation} This is now easily separable we have \begin{align} \int k \, dk &= \int du \\ \implies k &= \pm \sqrt{2u +c_1} \end{align} Here $c_1$ is an arbitrary constant. In what follows I'll just consider the positive branch. Now backtracking we have the following ODE $$ \begin{equation} \alpha = \frac{du}{dx} = u \sqrt{2u + c_1} \end{equation} $$ Let $\phi = 2u+c_1$ $$ \begin{equation} \frac{d\phi}{dx} = \sqrt{\phi}(\phi-c_1) \end{equation} $$ Introducing yet another substitution... $(\psi = \sqrt{\phi})$ \begin{equation} 2 \frac{d\psi}{dx} = \psi^2 - c_1 \end{equation} This is again separable We have \begin{align} \int \frac{d \psi}{\psi^2 - c_1} &= \frac{1}{2} \int dx \\  \implies- \frac{1}{\sqrt{c_1}}\tanh^{-1}\Big(\frac{\psi}{\sqrt{c_1}}\Big) &= \frac{x}{2} + c_2 \end{align} Leading to... \begin{equation} \psi = - \sqrt{c_1} \tanh\big(\sqrt{c_1}\Big(\frac{x}{2}+c_2\Big)\big) \end{equation} Back substituting using the definitions of $\psi, \phi$ and $u$ we arrive at \begin{align} e^y &=  \frac{c_1}{2}\big(\tanh^2\big(\sqrt{c_1}\Big(\frac{x}{2}+c_2\Big)\big) -1 \big) \\ \implies y(x) &= \ln \Big[\frac{c_1}{2}\big(\tanh^2\big(\sqrt{c_1}\Big(\frac{x}{2}+c_2\Big)\big) -1 \big)\Big] \end{align} There will also be a solution for the negative branch. I also find the method a bit laborious due to all of the new variables I need to define and the mundane algebra. I'm intrigued to know if there is a slicker way.","Some time ago I came across the following odd looking ODE as an exercise in a textbook. I can't seem to find the source.

I posted my solution attempt below. Can anyone please verify the solution and give me some hints concerning the doubts? Problem Given a function $f$ which satisfies the differential equation $$xf''(x) + 3x[f'(x)]^2 = 1 - e^{-x}$$ for all real $x$ . (a) If $f$ has an extremum at a point $c \neq 0$ , show that this extremum is a minimum. (b) If $f$ has an extremum at $0$ , is it a maximum or a minimum? (c) If $f(0) = f'(0) = 0$ , find the smallest constant $A$ such that $f(x) \leq Ax^2$ for all $x \geq 0$ . Solution (a) If $f$ has an extremum at a point $c \neq 0$ , then $f'(c) = 0$ . Plugging this into the differential equation, we get: $$cf''(c) = 1 - e^{-c} \implies f''(c) = \dfrac{1 - e^{-c}}{c}$$ By cases: If $c > 0$ , then $1 - e^{-c} > 0$ , so $f''(c)$ is positive. Otherwise, if $c < 0$ , then $1 - e^{-c} < 0$ , and so $f''(c)$ is positive. Either way, the second derivative, $f''(c)$ , is positive. Therefore, $f$ has a minimum at $c$ . (b) If $x \neq 0$ , we can divide both sides of the differential equation by $x$ to obtain: $$f''(x) + 3[f'(x)]^2 = \dfrac{1}{x} - \dfrac{1}{xe^x}$$ Consider the limit of the above expression as $x \to 0$ . If $f$ has an extremum at $0$ , then we have $f'(0) = 0$ , so the limit of the left-hand side expression is $\lim_{x \to 0} [f''(x) + 3[f'(x)]^2] = \lim_{x \to 0} f''(0)$ . Furthermore, the limit of the right-hand side expression is: $$\begin{aligned}     \lim_{x \to 0} \left( \dfrac{1}{x} - \dfrac{1}{xe^x} \right) &= \lim_{x \to 0} \left( \dfrac{e^x - 1}{xe^x} \right) \\     &= \lim_{x \to 0} \left( \dfrac{e^x}{e^x + xe^x} \right) & \text{(L'Hôpital)} \\     &= \lim_{x \to 0} \left( \dfrac{1}{1 + x} \right) = 1 \end{aligned}$$ Therefore, we have that $f''(0) \to 1$ as $x \to 0$ . Since this is a positive value, we can conclude that $f$ has a minimum at $0$ . DOUBT : Above, I am concluding that $f''(0)$ has a positive value based on the fact that $f''(0) \to 1$ . However, I think that this depends on assuming that $f''$ is continuous at $0$ . How can I justify this assumption? (c) DOUBT : I couldn't figure this one out. Any hint? EDIT : For item (c) , here is the beginning of an initial attempt. The Taylor expansion of $f(x)$ near $x = 0$ is: $$f(x) = f(0) + f'(0)x + f''(0)\dfrac{x^2}{2} + o(x^2)$$ We are given that $f(0) = f'(0) = 0$ . Also, from item (b), we concluded that $f''(x) \to 1$ as $x \to 0$ . If $f''(0)$ is continuous at zero (again: how can I justify this claim?), then we have $f''(0) = 1$ . So: $$f(x) = \dfrac{x^2}{2} + o(x^2)$$ If we can show that the remainder of this expansion is $\leq 0$ for all $x > 0$ , we will have $f(x) \leq x^2/2$ for all $x > 0$ , and so $A = \frac{1}{2}$ . Is this correct, and is there any way to proceed from here?","I have some doubts regarding the following problem from Apostol's Calculus I book (problem 31 from section 8.28).
