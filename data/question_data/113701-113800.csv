1,Diagram for third isomorphism theorem $\mathrm{(G/K)/(H/K)} \cong \mathrm{G/H}$,Diagram for third isomorphism theorem,\mathrm{(G/K)/(H/K)} \cong \mathrm{G/H},"I'm self-studying Lang's Algebra and on page 17, he gives a diagram for the third isomorphism theorem using a homomorphism f from $\mathrm{G/K}$ to $\mathrm{G/H}$ for two normal subgroups H and K of G such that $\mathrm{K\subseteq H}$. f is defined by $\mathrm{f(xK)=xH}$. Lang claims that the following commutative diagram represents this situation: $\require{AMScd}$ \begin{CD} 0@>>>H@>>>G@>>>G/H@>>>0\\ @. @VVcanV @VVcanV @VVidV\\ 0@>>>H/K@>>>G/K@>>>G/H@>>>0 \end{CD} where the rows are exact and can is a canonical morphism and id is the identity morphism. My question is, why are the rows exact, why is the diagram commutative (the main thing which I don't understand), how does this represent the third isomorphism theorem? I know that the first row with $\mathrm{G}$ is exact as the morphism from $\mathrm{H}$ to $\mathrm{G}$ is the inclusion (injective) and the morphism from $\mathrm{G}$ to $\mathrm{G/H}$ is the canonical map (surjective) but I'm not sure why the second row is exact; I'm not even sure what the morphisms are!(Lang doesn't mention what they are and in the diagram, they're just arrows with no labels). The map from $\mathrm{G/K}$ to $\mathrm{G/H}$ is probably the f mentioned above (which is surjective) but the map from $\mathrm{H/K}$ to $\mathrm{G/K}$ could be the inclusion map or the map induced by a homomorphism g which maps $\mathrm{H}$ to $\mathrm{G/K}$, which are both injective (Lang mentions this in an earlier example and says that that example relates to this). About the commutativity of the diagram, I think it's because isomorphisms are invertible or maybe because isomorphic groups are the same in structure, intuitively, this could mean a map from one has the same effect as a some map from the other group... For the relation to the third isomorphism theorem, there is no mention of $\mathrm{(G/K)/(H/K)}$ in the diagram, unlike the diagram Lang gave for the first isomorphism theorem so I don't have any idea about how it comes in at all.","I'm self-studying Lang's Algebra and on page 17, he gives a diagram for the third isomorphism theorem using a homomorphism f from $\mathrm{G/K}$ to $\mathrm{G/H}$ for two normal subgroups H and K of G such that $\mathrm{K\subseteq H}$. f is defined by $\mathrm{f(xK)=xH}$.

2,"Problem with proof of $H \cap K $ is of finite index if $ H,K$ are finite index subgroups",Problem with proof of  is of finite index if  are finite index subgroups,"H \cap K   H,K","I came across a proof earlier for a solution to a Herstein Topics in Algebra question earlier that I'm not convinced with, from AOPS site. If $G$ is a group and $H,K$ are two subgroups of finite index in $G$, prove that $H \cap K$ is of finite index in $G$. Can you find an upper bound for the index of $H \cap K$ in $G$? Since $[G:H]$ and $[G:K]$ are finite we can write: $$G = Hx_{1} \cup Hx_{2} \cup \cdots \cup Hx_{r}$$ and $$G = Ky_{1} \cup Ky_{2} \cup \cdots \cup Ky_{s}$$ where $[G:H]=r$ and $[G:K]=s$. Therefore, \begin{align*}  G = G \cap G &= (Hx_{1} \cup Hx_{2} \cup \cdots \cup Hx_{r}) \cap (Ky_{1} \cup Ky_{2} \cup \cdots \cup Ky_{s}) \\               &= \bigcup_{\substack{1 \le i \le r \\ 1 \le j \le s}} (Hx_{i} \cap Ky_{j}). \end{align*} Hence, we need to consider the sets $Hx_{i} \cap Ky_{j}$ in the union. Suppose $Hx_{i} \cap Ky_{j} \neq \varnothing$ so that for some $g \in G$,  $g \in Hx_{i} \cap Ky_{j}$. As right cosets in $G$ we have $Hg = Hx_{i}$ and $Hg = Ky_{j}$, so that we can write $Hg \cap Kg = Hx_{i} \cap Ky_{j}$. A small argument, set theoretical in nature, can show that $Hg \cap Kg = (H \cap K)g$. That is, $Hx_{i} \cap Ky_{j} = Hg \cap Kg = (H \cap K)g$ so each $Hx_{i} \cap Ky_{j}$ is either $\varnothing$ or some coset of $H \cap K$ in $G$. Since $$G = \bigcup_{\substack{1 \le i \le r \\ 1 \le j \le s}} (Hx_{i} \cap Ky_{j})$$ is a finite union, $Hx_{i} \cap Ky_{j}$ is either $\varnothing$ or some coset of $H \cap K$ in $G$ we know every coset of $H \cap K$ appears in this union as cosets are either equal or disjoint and their union fills out all of $G$. We can conclude not only $[G:H \cap K]$ is finite but also $$[G:H \cap K] \le [G:H][G:K]$$ since there are at most $[G:H][G:K]$ sets $Hx_{i} \cap Ky_{j}$. The problem Im having is with the part saying ""Suppose $Hx_{i} \cap Ky_{j} \neq \varnothing$ so that for some $g \in G$,  $g \in Hx_{i} \cap Ky_{j}$.

Fix a prime $p$, and suppose that a subgroup $H \leq G$ has the property that $C_G(x) \leq H$ for every element $x \in H$ having order $p$. Show that $p$ cannot divide both $|H|$ and $|G:H|$. My proof: Suppose that $p$ divides both $|H|$ and $|G:H|$. Let $P \in Syl_p(H)$. Since $p$ divides $|G:H|$, we see that $P$ cannot be in $Syl_p(G)$ (its order is too small), but it must be contained in some $Q \in Syl_p(G)$. Let $N = N_Q(P)$. Since $P < Q$ and $Q$ is a $p$-subgroup, we have $P < N \leq Q$ since ""normalizers grow"" in finite $p$-groups (because they are nilpotent). Let $N$ act on $P$ by conjugation. Suppose that $y \in P$ is a nonidentity element which is fixed by this action, i.e., $\{y\}$ is a one-point orbit. Then every element of $\langle y \rangle$ is also fixed, since, for example, $gy^2g^{-1} = (gyg^{-1})(gyg^{-1}) = y^2$. Since $\langle y \rangle$ is a $p$-subgroup, it contains some $x$ of order $p$. Since $x$ is fixed by the action, it is centralized by $N$. This means that $N \leq C_G(x)$. Since $C_G(x) \leq H$ by hypothesis, we have $P < N \leq H$. But this is impossible because $P \in Syl_p(H)$ and $N$ is a $p$-subgroup which properly contains $N$. We conclude that $1$ is the only fixed point in this action. Now by the orbit-stabilizer theorem, we have $|P| = 1 + \text{stuff divisible by }p$.

Denote the isomorphism as $\psi :  H \times N \to G$ First looking at the homomorhism $\phi$, I see that it's surgective homomorphism since each element in the codomain $H$ is mapped at least to $H$ subgroup in $G$.

Thus $G = HN$ which assures the surgectivity of $\psi$ Next observation is that $H \cap N$ is $\{1\}$ since $\phi(h) = h$ , if $h \in H$. Consider elements $(h_1,n_1), (h_2,n_2)$ in $H \times N$ which have same image $h_1n_1=h_2n_2$ in $HN$. i.e.,  $h_1h_2^{-1}=n_1^{-1}n_2$. So, $h_1h_2^{-1}=n_1^{-1}n_2 = 1$. Hence $h_1=h_2$ and $n_1=n_2$. Injectivy of $\psi$ is shown. Now consider the composition of two elements in $H \times  N$ $(h_1,n_1)$ and $(h_2,n_2)$, $(h_1h_2,n_1n_2)$. It's image in $G=HN$ would be $h_1h_2n_1n_2$ while the composition of individual products in $G$ would be $h_1n_1h_2n_2$. Since $G$ is abelian we say these are equal.

In the back-and-forth mailings Arturo Magidin made the following point, which I would never have realised: A infinite group of exponent two may not have an automorphism of order two.

That is, if we assume choice then your group is the direct sum of infinitely many copies of $C_2$ and we can simply choose a pair of $C_2$s in the direct sum decomposition and switch them.
