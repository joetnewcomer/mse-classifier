2,Correspondance between finite index subgroups of $\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ and regular coverings of the Torus,Correspondance between finite index subgroups of  and regular coverings of the Torus,\mathbb{Z}^{2},"Suppose we let $G = \mathbb{Z}^{2} = \left<x,y \mid xyx^{-1}y^{-1}\right>$ for $x = (1,0)$, and $y=(0,1)$. Then for a given index $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, we can find all index $n$ subgroups of $G$ by considering all lattices $\left<{(r,0),(p,q)}\right>_{\mathbb{Z}}$ for $r\cdot q = n$, and $0\leq p < r$. This comes from the smith normal form of a finitely generated-submodule of a free module (considering abelian groups as $\mathbb{Z}$-modules). For example, consider the index 4 subgroups, we get a subgroup for every combination $(r,p,q)$ such that $r,p,q \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$, $r\cdot q = n$ and $0 \leq p < r$. This gives the subgroups: \begin{align*} & \Lambda_{1} = \left<{(4,0),(0,1)}\right>_{\mathbb{Z}} && \Lambda_{2} = \left<{(4,0),(1,1)}\right>_{\mathbb{Z}} && \Lambda_{3} = \left<{(4,0),(2,1)}\right>_{\mathbb{Z}} & \\ & \Lambda_{4} = \left<{(4,0),(3,1)}\right>_{\mathbb{Z}} && \Lambda_{5} = \left<{(2,0),(0,2)}\right>_{\mathbb{Z}} && \Lambda_{6} = \left<{(2,0),(1,2)}\right>_{\mathbb{Z}} \end{align*} Then since $G$ is abelian, every subgroup of $G$ is normal, and since $G$ is the fundamental group of the space $X$ (i.e the Torus) gained by attaching the 2-cell along the loop $xyx^{-1}y^{-1}$ to $B_{2}$ (the bouquet of two circles), there is a one to one correspondence between the index $n$ subgroups of $G$ and regular $n$-degree coverings of $X$. A nice way to visualise the coverings corresponding to $\Lambda_{i}$, is to construct a surjective group homomorphisms $\phi_{i} : G \rightarrow H_{i}$, for $H_{i}$ an appropriate group of order 4, such that $\operatorname{ker}(\phi_{i}) = \Lambda_{i}$. In our case it's quite simple to see that the following work for $\Lambda_{i}$, $1\leq i \leq 5$, but I can't seem to find such a map for $\Lambda_{6}$. \begin{align*} & \phi_{1}: G \rightarrow C_{4} = \left< \xi \mid \xi^{4}=1 \right> && (1,0) \mapsto \xi && (0,1) \mapsto 1 & \\ & \phi_{2}: G \rightarrow C_{4} = \left< \xi \mid \xi^{4}=1 \right> && (1,0) \mapsto \xi && (0,1) \mapsto \xi^{3} & \\ & \phi_{3}: G \rightarrow C_{4} = \left< \xi \mid \xi^{4}=1 \right> && (1,0) \mapsto \xi && (0,1) \mapsto \xi^{2} & \\ & \phi_{4}: G \rightarrow C_{4} = \left< \xi \mid \xi^{4}=1 \right> && (1,0) \mapsto \xi && (0,1) \mapsto \xi & \\ & \phi_{5}: G \rightarrow C_{2}\times C_{2} = \left<\eta \mid \eta^{2}\right> \times \left< \kappa \mid \kappa^{2}\right> && (1,0) \mapsto (\eta,0)  && (0,1) \mapsto (0,\kappa) & \\ \end{align*} Since, from here, it is relatively trivial (since there is a low number of generators of low order) to produce the corresponding coverings of the torus, if I could find the map for $\Lambda_{6}$, I would have classified all 6 (up to covering transformation) regular degree 4 coverings of the torus.

3,Tensor product of ultrafilters corresponds to iterated limit,Tensor product of ultrafilters corresponds to iterated limit,,"I will use letters such as $p$, $q$ for filters (or ultrafilters). I want to ask about correspondence between iterated limit and $p\otimes q$-limit, but let me start by mentioning the relevant definitions and notation. $\require{begingroup}\begingroup\newcommand{\Flim}[2]{\lim\limits_{#1\to#2}}$ Tensor product. Let $p$ be a filter on a set $X$, $q$ be a filter on a set $Y$. Then the system $$\{A\subseteq X\times Y; \{x; \{y; (x,y)\in A\}\in q\}\in p\}$$ is a filter on $X\times Y$. This filter is called tensor product or Fubini product of the filters $p$ and $q$ and denoted by $p\otimes q$. If we denote $A_x=\{y; (x,y)\in A\}$ the $x$-cut of the set $A$, then we can say more briefly $$A\in p\otimes q \Leftrightarrow \{x; A_x\in q\}\in p.$$ For people who are used to work with filter quantifiers 1 this can also be expressed as \begin{align*} A\in p\otimes q &\Leftrightarrow (\forall_p x) A_x\in q \\ &\Leftrightarrow (\forall_p x) (\forall_q y) (x,y)\in A \\ \end{align*} It can be shown that if both $p$ and $q$ are ultrafilters , so is $p\otimes q$.

An important property is that if $p$ is an ultrafilter and $T$ is compact, then the $p$-limit exists. Correspondence. Let $f\colon X\times Y\to T$, where $T$ is a compact Hausdorff topological space. Then for any two ultrafilters $p$ on $X$ and $q$ on $Y$, we have $$\Flim xp \Flim yq f(x,y) = \Flim{(x,y)}{p\otimes q} f(x,y)$$ in the sense the limit on the one side of the above equality exists, then so does the other one and the limits are equal to each other. In fact, the above property characterizes the tensor product of ultrafilters. (In the sense that there exists unique ultrafilter on $X\times Y$ with the above properties. To see this it suffices to take $T=\{0,1\}$ with discrete topology and notice that $\Flim xp \chi_A(x)=1$ iff $A\in p$, so if we know limits of indicator functions, this uniquely determines the filter.) If we only require $p$ and $q$ to be filters, then the existence of the iterated limit implies the existence of $p\otimes q$-limit. (But not conversely.) For this implication we can also omit the assumption that $T$ is compact. When I searched for some references for this fact, I was able to find some places mentioning that $$p\otimes q = \Flim{(x,y)}{p\otimes q} (x,y)$$ for any $p\in\beta X$, $q\in\beta Y$; where we consider $X$, $Y$ endowed with the discrete topology and the ultrafilters are viewed as points of the Stone-Čech compactification .

Any open subset of $\Bbb R$ is a at most countable union of disjoint open intervals. [Collecting Proofs] .  However, I'm not so sure what would be a good way to prove this in $\overline{\mathbb R}$, the extended real line.  According to Rudin's Real and Complex Analysis , the topology $\tau$ in $\overline{\mathbb R}$ consists of sets of the form $(a,b), [-\infty, a), (a, \infty]$ and any union of segments of this type, where $a,b \in \mathbb R$ are arbitrary real numbers.

If $-\infty\notin V$ and $\infty \notin V$, then the proof is the same as that in $\mathbb R$. Otherwise, suppose $-\infty\in V$.  Then some $A_t$ must be of the form $[-\infty, a_t)$.

The proof is hence completed by noting that $V=V_0\cup V_1\cup V_2,$ so it must be an at most countable union of segments of the form $(a,b)$, $[-\infty, a),$ or $(a, \infty]$.

Let $α ∈ \bar F_r$ and let $U$ be a neighborhood of $α$. Since $X$ is first countable, there is a sequence $(α_j)_{j∈\mathbb N}$ in $F_r$ converging to $α$. For each $α_j$, we can find $A_j ⊂ \mathbb N$ with ${\lim_{n→∞}}_{n∈ {A_j}} x_n=α_j$   and $\lim_{n→∞}ϕ(A_j\backslash [1,n])\ge {1\over r}$. Let $(\epsilon_j)_{j∈\mathbb N}$ be a monotonically decreasing sequence of positive real numbers converging to $0$.   We now proceed as follows:      First choose $n_1 ∈ \mathbb N$ such that $ϕ(A_1\backslash [1,n_1])\ge {1\over r}−{{\epsilon_1}\over 2}$. Now lower semicontinuity of $ϕ$ implies   that $ϕ(A_1\backslash [1,n_1]) = \lim_{n→∞} ϕ[(A_1\backslash [1,n_1]) ∩ [1,n]]$. Choose $m ∈ \mathbb N$ such that $ϕ[(A_1\backslash [1,n_1]) ∩ [1,n]]\ge ϕ(A_1\backslash [1,n_1]) −{\epsilon_1\over 2}∀n\ge m$. Again there exists $m_1 ∈ \mathbb N$ such that $ϕ(A_2\backslash [1,n]) \ge {1\over r} −{\epsilon_2 \over 2} ∀n\ge m_1$. Now choose $n_2 > n_1,m,m_1$. Then clearly   we have simultaneously $ϕ(A_1 ∩ (n_1,n_2])\ge {1\over r}−\epsilon_1$ and also $ϕ(A_2\backslash [1,n_2])\ge {1\over r}−{\epsilon_2\over 2}$.  Proceeding as above we now choose   $n_3 > n_2$ such that $ϕ(A_2 ∩ (n_2,n_3])\ge {1\over r}−\epsilon_2$ and $ϕ(A_3\backslash [1,n_3])\ge {1\over r}-{\epsilon_3 \over 2}$ and so on. Thus we can construct a sequence   $n_1 < n_2 < n_3 < ···$ of positive integers such that   $$ϕ(A_j∩(n_j,n_{j+1}])\ge {1\over r}−\epsilon_j, j ∈ \mathbb N.$$   Let us define $$A=\bigcup_j\{A_j∩(n_j,n_{j+1}]\}$$. Then clearly ${\lim_{n→∞} ϕ(A\backslash [1,n])\ge {1\over r}}$ and so ${A \not∈ I}$. Let $A=\{l_1<l_2<l_3< ···\}$. Since   $\lim_j α_j = α$ and $α ∈ U$ so $α_j ∈ U ∀ j\ge j_0$ for some $j_0∈\mathbb N$. $\color{blue}{\text{ This implies that }x_n∈U\text{ for all but a finite number of indices }n\text{ of the set }A}$. Therefore $α∈F_r$. Hence $F_r$ is a closed subset of $X$. The assertion now immediately follows from the fact that $I(L_x)=\bigcup _{r=1}^∞Fr$.
