The proof proceed by differentiating, then recognize that this is a geometric series, and then integrating again, it can be shown that this is just the Taylor's series of $\arctan$ . This is a well-known in calculus. Leibniz's original geometric argument can be easily related to it: he basically showed, by drawing circle and chord, something that (after an algebraic manipulation) is equivalent to $\frac{d\arctan(x)}{dx}=\frac{1}{1+x^{2}}$ , a result much more easily obtained now using the more general theorem about inverse function theorem, or trig substitution, after knowing the derivative of $\tan$ . Circles even show up here due to trigonometric functions. Number theory proof: The second proof come by studying the Dirichlet series $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(-1)^{n}(2n+1)^{-s}=\frac{1}{1^{s}}-\frac{1}{3^{s}}+\frac{1}{5^{s}}-\frac{1}{7^{s}}+\ldots$ and then ""take the limit $s\rightarrow 1^{+}$ "" (perform analytic continuation to $Re(s)>\frac{1}{2}$ ). The proof proceed by showing that $2(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(-1)^{n}(2n+1)^{-s})(\sum_{z\in\mathbb{Z}\backslash\{0\}}|z|^{-s})=\sum_{z\in\mathbb{Z[i]}\backslash\{0\}}(|z|^{2})^{-s}$ . This can be shown from the following number theory fact: $r_{2}(n)=4(d_{1}(n)-d_{3}(n))$ . Here $r_{2}(n)$ that the number of ways to write a positive integer $n$ as a sum of 2 squares, counting swapping position as distinct, counting negative numbers squared as distinct, basically counting all possible ordered pair of integers $(a,b)$ such that $a^{2}+b^{2}=n$ . And $d_{1}(n)$ the number of positive divisors of $n$ that are $1(\mod 4)$ , $d_{3}(n)$ the number of positive divisors of $n$ that are $3(\mod 4)$ . This number-theoretic fact can be proved from Fermat's theorem about which prime can be written as the sum of 2 squares, and the fact that $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is an Euclidean domain (since it forms a lattice). Once the equation $2(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(-1)^{n}(2n+1)^{-s})(\sum_{z\in\mathbb{Z}\backslash\{0\}}|z|^{-s})=\sum_{z\in\mathbb{Z[i]}\backslash\{0\}}(|z|^{2})^{-s}$ is known, taking limit is easy. $\lim_{s\rightarrow 1^{+}}\frac{1}{2}\frac{\sum_{z\in\mathbb{Z[i]}\backslash\{0\}}(|z|^{2})^{-s}}{\sum_{z\in\mathbb{Z}\backslash\{0\}}|z|^{-s}}$ can be computed by replacing the numerator and denominator by a continuous approximation $\lim_{s\rightarrow 1^{+}}\frac{1}{2}\frac{\int_{z\in\mathbb{C}\backslash\{0\}}(|z|^{2})^{-s}dz}{\int_{z\in\mathbb{R}\backslash\{0\}}|z|^{-s}dz}$ , and change to polar coordinate this is just $\frac{1}{2}\frac{\pi\int_{r\in\mathbb{R}^{+}}r^{-s}dr}{2\int_{r\in\mathbb{R}^{+}}r^{-s}dr}$ . So we obtain the result. Circles even show up as polar coordinate.

Conceptually the 2 proofs are still very different, or at least seems to be. So my question is this. Is there a deeper connection behind the scene of these 2 proofs that I did not know about? Is there some sort of ""bijective"" transformation of one proof into another? Or are they just so completely different that there are no ways? EDIT: forgot to mention this, but this observation is obvious. In the number theory proof we use $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ , while in the calculus proof we use $\frac{1}{x^{2}+1}$ .

11,Error in Divisor Function Modelled With Waves,Error in Divisor Function Modelled With Waves,,"The divisor function counts the number of divisors of an integer. A model is described where the divisor function is seen as summation of repeating continuous waves. The divisor function now has a real and imaginary component. This divisor wave model introduces an error in the solution. The wave divisor function method is presented, also a description of the error is given.  Last section has some questions I am unable to answer. I cannot summarize more than written below unfortunately. Wave divisor function: $\sigma_{0}(x)$ The integer divisor function can be described as a summation of repeating waves. Each wave filters out numbers. Divisor wave $\mathbb{X}=7$ will filter: 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 etc. The divisor function can be described as: $$ \sigma_{0}(x)=\sum_{\mathbb{X}=2}^{\infty}\cos^{N} \left( \frac{\pi}{\mathbb{X}}x \right)$$ Here from $x$ the number of divisors is determined excluding divisor $1$ . $N$ should be a positive even integer; only then positive pulses occur so $N \in 2 \mathbb{N}$ . If: $N \rightarrow \infty$ discrete pulses with magnitude $1$ occur on the intervals determined by: $\mathbb{X}$ . This definition of the divisor function does not take $1$ in account, for the conventional definition $1$ should be added to the wave divisor function. With Euler’s formula and the binomial theorem, the function can be rewritten as: $$ \sigma_{0}(x)=\sum_{\mathbb{X}=2}^{\infty}e^{i\left( \frac{N\pi}{\mathbb{X}}x \right)} 2^{(-N)} \sum_{k=0}^{N} \binom{N}{k} e^{-i\left( \frac{\pi}{\mathbb{X}}kx \right)}  $$ The solution for the divisor function occurs when the angular component is $0$ only then pulses of magnitude 1 occur. For the divisor function we can set: $$e^{i\left( \frac{N\pi}{\mathbb{X}}x \right)}=1$$ While $N \pi$ will always be a multiple of $2 \pi$ because $N$ must be a positive even integer. So, the ""Wave Divisor Function"" becomes: $$ \sigma_{0}(x)=\sum_{\mathbb{X}=2}^{\infty} 2^{(-N)} \sum_{k=0}^{N} \binom{N}{k} e^{-i\left( \frac{\pi}{\mathbb{X}}kx \right)}  $$ The n choose k notation can be written in a trigonometric formulation. $$ \Re(\sigma_{0})=\sum_{\mathbb{X}=2}^{\infty}\cos^{N} \left( \frac{\pi}{\mathbb{X}}x \right) \cos \left( \frac{N\pi}{\mathbb{X}}x  \right) $$ $$ \Im(\sigma_{0})=-i \sum_{\mathbb{X}=2}^{\infty}\cos^{N} \left( \frac{\pi}{\mathbb{X}}x \right) \sin \left( \frac{N\pi}{\mathbb{X}}x  \right) $$ This is only valid with the following criteria (found by setting above equations equal): $$ \cos^{2} \left( \frac{N\pi}{\mathbb{X}}x  \right) + \sin^{2} \left( \frac{N\pi}{\mathbb{X}}x  \right)=1$$ Thus, the solution of the divisor function is only valid for integer values of $x$ . The wave divisor function consists of repeating wave packages with different frequencies. A wave pulse outline is modulated with a high frequency. When N increases in size the wave packages become narrower and the frequency of the signal increases. One can select a $N$ for every value of $\mathbb{X}$ such that the pulse width for all waves becomes similar. N the pulse width definition. The wave divisor function consists of repeating wave packages. The width of a wave package can be described as the pulse height $L$ at $\Delta x$ : $$ \cos^{N} \left( \frac{\pi}{\mathbb{X}} \Delta x \right)=L$$ From the above equation we can calculate the magnitude of $N$ . The wave package width will also vary depending upon the value of $\mathbb{X}$ . Thus, $N$ is a function of $\mathbb{X}$ . $N(\mathbb{X})$ can derived: $$ N(\mathbb{X})= \frac{\log (L)}{\log \left(  \cos \left(  \frac {\pi}{\mathbb{X} } \Delta x  \right)\right)}  \quad N \in 2 \mathbb{N} $$ For $(\mathbb{X} \rightarrow \infty)$ $N$ can be approximated as Taylor series: $$ N(\mathbb{X}) =   \frac{2 \mathbb{X}^2 \log(L)}{\pi^2 \Delta x^2} + \frac{\log(L)}{3}+ \mathcal{O} \left( \frac{1}{\mathbb{X}^2} \right)$$ Wavepulse outline. The wave divisor function consists of a pulse outline modulated with a high frequency component. The real solution of the wave divisor function is: $$ \Re(\sigma_{0})=\sum_{\mathbb{X}=2}^{\infty}\cos^{N} \left( \frac{\pi}{\mathbb{X}}x \right) \cos \left( \frac{N\pi}{\mathbb{X}}x  \right) $$ The first term $cos^N$ can also be simplified, this is the pulse outline. The pulse outline forms a bell-shaped distribution around the origin for $\mathbb{X} \rightarrow \infty$ : $$ O(x)=\lim_{\mathbb{X} \rightarrow \infty}\cos^{N} \left( \frac{\pi}{\mathbb{X}}x \right)= e^{a x^{2}}$$ $$ a=\frac{\log(L) \space}{\Delta x^{2}}=constant$$ The high frequency component $HF(\mathbb{X})$ scales linear with $\mathbb{X}$ (see link for more information) for: $\mathbb{X} \rightarrow \infty$ . $$ HF(x)= \cos \left( \frac{N\pi}{\mathbb{X}} x \right) \approx \cos (b x)$$ $$ b(\mathbb{X}) = \frac{N}{\mathbb{X}}\pi \approx  - \frac{2 \space \log(L)}{\pi \space \Delta x^{2}} \mathbb{X} = constant \cdot \mathbb{X}$$ So for $\mathbb{X} \rightarrow \infty$ the wave divisor function becomes: $$ \Re(\sigma_{0})\rightarrow \sum_{\mathbb{X}=2}^{\infty}e^{a x^{2}} \cos (b x) $$ Error of the Wave Divisor Function. The error of the wave divisor function is majorly determined by neighbor pulses like: $\sigma(x-1)$ and $\sigma(x+1)$ . The maximum error from a direct neighbor can be determined from the wave pulse outline: $$ max(\varepsilon)=exp \left( \frac{\log(L)}{\Delta x^2}      \right)$$ Error caused by $\sigma(x-m)$ and $\sigma(x+m)$ also contribute to the error. For pulses m steps away from $x$ : $$ \varepsilon(m)=exp \left( \frac{\log(L)}{\Delta x^2}   m^{2}   \right)$$ In between the limits the error will occur. The exact value of the error is determined by $HF(x)$ . The frequency of $HF(x)$ scales almost linear with $\mathbb{X}$ . For direct neighbor divisors the error can be formulated. Where $\mathbb{X}|(x-1)$ means $\mathbb{X}$ divides $(x-1)$ , $k$ is a constant determined by the pulse width. $$ \varepsilon (x) \approx max(\varepsilon) \cdot \left[ \sum_{\mathbb{X}\vert (x-1)}^{} \cos(k \mathbb{X}) + \sum_{\mathbb{X}\vert (x+1)}^{} \cos(k \mathbb{X}) \right]$$ It is assumed that for large values $x$ its divisors are randomly distributed. Also, the rounding of $N$ to its closest even integer causes a randomizing effect. It is expected that the error is picked from an arcsine distribution. The Variance in the case of an arcsine distribution can be calculated. For neighbor pulses at $(x-1)$ and $(x+1)$ the variance is: $$ Var(\mathbb{X})=\frac{1}{2} \cdot  max^{2}(\varepsilon)$$ For other divisors m steps away: $$ Var(\mathbb{X})=\frac{1}{2} \cdot  \varepsilon^{2}(m)$$ The total error is summed. It appears that the error follows a random walk over an arcsine distribution. The total number of neighbor divisors determine the total variation. The total error will be the contribution of direct and neighbor pulses: $$ Var(x) =\frac{1}{2} max^{2}(\varepsilon) \left( \sum_{m=1}^{\infty} \frac{\sigma_{0}(x+m) \cdot \varepsilon^{2} (m)}{max^{2}(\varepsilon)}   +  \sum_{m=1}^{\infty} \frac{\sigma_{0}(x-m) \cdot \varepsilon^{2} (m)}{max^{2}(\varepsilon)}    \right)$$ The error description is not ideal. Errors $m$ steps away can be counted duplet, like divisor of $\mathbb{X}=2$ could be counted double. Though, when the pulse width is small $\Delta x \rightarrow 0$ the error converges. The error will be determined by direct neighbor divisors. Thus, counting duplets is not the case. This relation takes a sort of mean value of the divisor count: $$ Var(x)  \approx  \frac{1}{2} \cdot max^{2}(\varepsilon) \cdot (\sigma_{0}(x+1) +\sigma_{0}(x-1))$$ $$ Var(x) \approx  max^{2}(\varepsilon) \cdot \overline{\sigma_{0}(x)} $$ The mean divisor growth is defined by Dirichlet. For now we do not included the error term $\mathcal{O}(x^{\Theta^{*}})$ . Note that an extra $(-1)$ is added the wave divisor function is excluding divisor: 1. $$ \overline{ D(x)} \approx \log(x) + 2 \gamma -1 -(1)$$ The standard deviation in the wave divisor function than is then proportional to: $$ Stdev(x) \approx max(\varepsilon) \cdot \sqrt{\log(x)+ 2 \gamma -2}$$ Simulation of the error. For a given pulse width $L=0.5$ , $\Delta x=0.2$ the divisor count can be determined. The error in the Wave Divisor can be calculated as: $$\varepsilon (x)=\sigma_{0}(x)_{Wave}-\sigma_{0}(x)_{Discrete}$$ The error is calculated for all integers x till the number 50000 in the presented simulation. The boundaries are determined and plotted as: $3Stdev$ $(99.7 \%)$ . Several observations can be made: There occur more positive errors. 99.606% is counted within the boundaries while 99.7 % is expected. Questions.

The axioms. The axioms for the set $Z$ of integers are $Z$ is not empty. To each integer $x$ there is associated a unique integer ${x}'$ (called the successor of $x$ ). For all integers $x$ and $y$ , if ${x}'={y}'$ , then $x=y$ . For each integer $y$ there is an integer $x$ such that ${x}'=y$ . (This $x$ , which is unique by Axiom 3, is called the predecessor of $y$ , and is denoted by ${}^\backprime{y}$ .) If $M$ is a set of integers such that (i) $M$ is not empty ; (ii) for every integer $x$ , $x$ is in $M$ if and only if ${x}'$ is in $M$ ; then $M=Z$ . There is a subset $Q$ of $Z$ such that (i) $Q$ is not empty; (ii) for every integer $x$ , if $x$ is in $Q$ , then ${x}'$ is in $Q$ ; $Q\ne Z$ . Sounds quite reasonable to me. What I don't understand is this peculiar way to define the set of positive integers $P$ . 4. Order. In this section we show that $Z$ is an ordered ring, and its set of positive elements satisfies the Peano axioms. For the set $Q$ of Axiom 6, there is an $x$ such that ${x}'$ is in $Q$ and $x$ is not in $Q$ . Otherwise, $Q=Z$ by Axiom 5, contradicting Axiom 6.  Let $0$ be such  an $x$ and let $1={0}'$ . The $0$ and $1$ of Section 3 are  now fixed  to  be this $0$ and $1$ . I completely agree with that. If the statement $\exists x\in Z\left( {x}'\in Q\wedge x\notin Q \right)$ was false then $\forall x\in Z\left( {x}'\notin Q\vee x\in Q \right)$ would be true. The statement $\forall x\in Z\left( x\in Q \right)$ implies that $Z\subseteq Q$ - an obvious contradiction. The same can be said about $\forall x\in Z\left( {x}'\notin Q \right)$ . Since each integer $x$ has its predecessor $y$ , no integer can be contained in the set $Q$ , therefore, $Q=\varnothing $ - a contradiction. So far, we've established that there is at least one $x\in Z$ such that ${x}'\in Q\wedge x\notin Q$ . Shouldn't we at first prove that there is precisely one such $x\in Z$ and only then assign the symbol $0$ to it? Let $P$ be the intersection of all sets $M$ such that I. $1$ is in $M$ ; II. For every $x$ , if $x$ is in M, then ${x}'$ is in $M$ ; III. $0$ is not in $M$ . $P$ exists because the set $Q$ of Axiom 6 is such an $M$ .

We also know with the units digit being a $6$, that the first two digits are limited to a set of numbers, 96 being one of them. So just by knowing the last digit is $6$, one partial solution could be $8*796$, but could also be $8*744$. Regardless, there are very few options and the result set is narrowed. Just by applying $0-9$ to $8*796$, iterate through them, you would stumble across 81796 with a square root of $286$. If the problem was restricted to perfect squares with relatively smaller numbers, the solution would be simple - just find the max/min roots $(284-299)$, square them and find the perfect squares that satisfy the pattern of $8*7*6$, for example. Another example is $1*2*3*4$ where the square root is $1312^2 = 1721344$. However, using this algorithm, my program takes forever to run with very large integers. Seems like there would be a way of building the square by applying perfect square properties, or applying another algorithm that reduces the possibilities.

For example, one such problem was to prove that $a^5 \equiv a \pmod{10}$ for $a$ $\varepsilon$ $\mathbb Z^+\ $This problem on its own becomes difficult only because we are not guaranteed that for every a $(a,10)=1$. The solution was to factorize 10 in terms of primes $p_1, p_2... p_n$ s.t for each prime $p_i$ $(a,p_i)=1$ for all $a \ \varepsilon \ \mathbb Z^+\ $, resulting in n congruences under modulo the given prime and then apply Euler's Theorem. In this case we find the following: $$10 = 2 \cdot 5$$ so $$a^{\phi(5)} \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \\ a^{\phi(2)} \equiv 1 \pmod{2}$$ since $\phi(5)=4, \phi(2)=1$ this becomes: $$a^{4} \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \implies a^{5} \equiv a \pmod{5}\\ a^{1} \equiv 1 \pmod{2} \implies a^{5} \equiv a^4 \pmod{2} $$ but since a is its own inverse modulo 2, we can transform the 2nd congruence into:  $$a^5 \equiv a \mod{2}$$ Then the part that I am unclear on occurs. It seems that we can just multiply the 2 moduli together and the desired congruence falls out that: $$a^5 \equiv a \pmod{10}$$ So my question is whether or not $a \equiv b \pmod{n}$ and $a \equiv b \pmod{m}$ always$\implies$ $a \equiv b \pmod{mn}$.

In this case we find the following: $$10 = 2 \cdot 5$$ so $$a^{\phi(5)} \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \\ a^{\phi(2)} \equiv 1 \pmod{2}$$ since $\phi(5)=4, \phi(2)=1$ this becomes: $$a^{4} \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \implies a^{5} \equiv a \pmod{5}\\ a^{1} \equiv 1 \pmod{2} \implies a^{5} \equiv a^4 \pmod{2} $$ but since a is its own inverse modulo 2, we can transform the 2nd congruence into:  $$a^5 \equiv a \mod{2}$$ Then the part that I am unclear on occurs. It seems that we can just multiply the 2 moduli together and the desired congruence falls out that: $$a^5 \equiv a \pmod{10}$$ So my question is whether or not $a \equiv b \pmod{n}$ and $a \equiv b \pmod{m}$ always$\implies$ $a \equiv b \pmod{mn}$. Edit (Extension): The answer to my question has been stated to be yes provided that $(m,n) = 1$ but I also noticed that if my 2 relations had been left stated as  $$a^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{2}$$ $$a^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$$ Applying the conjecture I made gives: $$a^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{10}$$ which is demonstrably false given that $$2^4 \equiv 6 \pmod{10} \implies 2^4 \not\equiv 1 \pmod{10}$$ Why is this and what prevents this identity from being true as well? I see that 2 would then not be coprime to 10 but why does it work when I multiply both sides by a then?",,"['number-theory', 'elementary-number-theory', 'chinese-remainder-theorem']"

I asked Do monic irreducible polynomials assume at least one prime value? which allowed for a case I had forgotten. The case of interest is $x^4 + a,$ for $a > 0.$ It is not difficult to show that this is irreducible when $a > 0,$ $a \neq 4 k^4.$ Find all positive integers $m$, such that $n^4+m$ is not prime for any positive integer $n$ That's the question, does irreducible $x^4 + a$ assume at least one prime value? computer run for $1 \leq a \leq 325$ ================================= a 1  x 1 prime  2  a 2

Hint: the ideal class group order of $\mathcal{O}_{-6}$, $h_{\sqrt{-6}}=2$. $$\\$$ First we note that if $K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-6})$, then $R=\mathcal{O}_K=\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-6}]$, and by some theorem, since $-6\equiv2 \pmod4$, then the ideal $(2)_R$ ramifies into $\mathfrak{p}_2^2$, where $\mathfrak{p}_2=(2,\sqrt{-6})_R$, which cannot be a principal ideal since there is no solution to $a^2+6b^2=2$ over the integers. Hence the class group $Cl(R)=\{e,[\mathfrak{p}_2]\}$, since its order is 2. We can factorise so that if $\alpha =x+3\sqrt{-6}$, then $\alpha\tilde{\alpha}=y^3$. Now, note that $2\nmid x$ (otherwise $2|y\Rightarrow 4|54=2\cdot3^3$, contradiction), so $2\nmid y$.

Hence $(\alpha\tilde\alpha)_R\sim (y)_R^3\sim e$. This in turn implies that in the maximal ideal decomposition of $(\alpha)_R$, we cannot have a factor of $\mathfrak{p}_2$, and so $(\alpha)_R\sim(\tilde\alpha)_R\sim e$. Then we can write $(\alpha)_R=\prod_{i=1}^n\mathfrak{q}_i^{r_i}$ for $\mathfrak{q}_i\nsim\mathfrak{p}_2$ maximal ideals.

My idea is to take $K$ to be a splitting field of $f(x)$ and to prove that $K=\mathbb Q$. Unfortunately, I do not understand a connection between integers ring and $f(x)$: neither $\mathcal O_K \neq \mathbb Z[x]/f(x)$, nor I see why a ramification of ideals in $\mathcal O_K$ is connected with $\zeta_K(s)$. Could you tell me a right direction or a hint?",,"['number-theory', 'algebraic-number-theory', 'analytic-number-theory', 'zeta-functions']"
