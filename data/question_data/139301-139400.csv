In all treatments of ODEs that I have seen, it is assumed that if $u(t,c_1, \dots, c_n)$ is a general solution of this ODE then it is unique, i.e. $\nexists v: I \subset \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $v^{(n)} = F(t,v,\dots,v^{(n-1)}) \ \& \ \nexists c_1, \dots, c_n \in \mathbb{R} : v(t) = u(t,c_1, \dots, c_n)$ . Then they go on to show that if $u$ is a linear combination of linearly independent particular solutions (their Wronskian is nonzero) then it satisfies the ODE and a well-defined IVP. See for example here and here . Shouldn't we prove that all solutions are of this form? And how do we prove this? P.S.
