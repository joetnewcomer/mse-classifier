Examples of this are the following: The real line, or any line in $\mathbb{R}^n$ . any point can be mapped to any other point by shifting the line. So all points are kind of the same. The perimeter of a circle embedded in $\mathbb{R}^2$ , any point can be mapped to any other point by rotation so again all points are kind of the same. The surface of a sphere (which naturally embeds in $\mathbb{R}^3$ or higher, any point can clearly be rotated to any other point. The surface of an infinite cylinder embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$ .

In $\mathbb{R}^3$ the torus isn’t homogenous because most obvious the inner perimeter has a different length than the outer perimeter.

All threads I've seen that address this question only address the former and not the latter. Here is what I mean by this. These threads usually are something to the effect of ""Homotopy equivalent spaces can be thought of as spaces that can be continuously stretched, squished, deformed into the other"" without explaining how this intuitive sentiment is translated from the formal definition. If not, these threads will try to make the idea of a homotopy intuitive through the use of various examples, usually deformation retractions. Here are some examples of these threads: 1 , 2 , this one, I don't have the background to fully understand , 4 , Wikipedia, and a lot more. I understand the idea behind a homotopy and I intuitively understand how a deformation retraction looks like. Indeed, I understand that a deformation retraction satisfies the definition of homotopy equivalence - but that's just it. I know how to show it satisfies the property of homotopy equivalence, just like I know that integer addition satisfies associativity. But why should I believe that the homotopy equivalence definition captures the intuitive idea that people claim it captures when associativity of a binary operator doesn't fully capture the idea addition? It feels arbitrary. In conclusion, Homotopy equivalence seems like an arbitrary weakening of the homeomorphism definition and I can't seem to divine any intuition from its formal definition. I've scoured the internet and multiple texts and none were helpful. This is a problem as I try to proceed through Hatcher without any intuition of it whatsoever.","X Y f g f:X \to Y,g: Y \to X g \circ f f \circ g","['general-topology', 'algebraic-topology', 'soft-question']"
