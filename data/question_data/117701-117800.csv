By Pythagoras' Theorem, $$\overline{AB} = \overline{MC} = \sqrt{\overline{BC}^2 + \overline{BM}^2} = \sqrt{\left(1\right)^2 + \left(\frac12\right)^2} = \frac{\sqrt5}{2}$$ So perimeter of the triangle is: $$\begin{align} P&=\overline{AF} +\overline{FM}+\overline{MC}+\overline{CD}+\overline{DE}+\overline{EA}\\ &= \frac12+\frac12+\frac{\sqrt5}2+1+\frac12+\frac{\sqrt5}2\\ &= \frac52+\sqrt5 \end{align}$$ However this is not the correct answer and I know that the problem is with the supposition that $M$ is the midpoint of $\overline{AB}$ .

32,Geometric interpretation of complex inner products,Geometric interpretation of complex inner products,,"Thanks for reading. In short, my question is this: What's the geometric interpretation of inner products when we allow our vectors to have complex components? Now, to give a little context... When I think of vectors that allow for complex components, I think of it as we're attaching a new orthogonal axis to each axis of the cartesian plane in which we put that corresponding complex component. So $2$ dimensional vectors that allow for complex components are really $4$ dimensional, since both their $x$ component and their $y$ component have an additional ""complex axis"" attached to them. I'm not sure if this is a good way to think about vectors with complex components, but it's the way I've been thinking about them thus far. The dot product between two real-valued vectors $\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}$ can be interpreted as multiplying the magnitude of the projection of $\vec{a}$ onto $\vec{b}$ by the magnitude of $\vec{b}$ . If we allow $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ to be complex, then the above only seems to be true when the components of $\vec{a}$ and the components of $\vec{b}$ point in the same ""direction"" on their corresponding complex planes. An example: Let $\vec{a}=\begin{bmatrix} i\\  1 \end{bmatrix}$ and $\vec{b}=\begin{bmatrix} i\\  -3 \end{bmatrix}$ Then, $\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}=(i)(-i)+(1)(-3)=(1)-3=-2$ Which can indeed be interpreted as the magnitude of the projection of $\vec{a}$ onto $\vec{b}$ multiplied by the magnitude of $\vec{b}$ . Another example: Let $\vec{a}=\begin{bmatrix} 2+i\\  1 \end{bmatrix}$ and $\vec{b}=\begin{bmatrix} 4+2i\\  -3 \end{bmatrix}$ Then, $\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}=(2+i)(4-2i)+(1)(-3)=(8+2)-3=7$ Once again, this can be interpreted as the magnitude of the projection of $\vec{a}$ onto $\vec{b}$ multiplied by the magnitude of $\vec{b}$ . Note that $(2+i)$ and $(4+2i)$ , the two $x$ components of our vectors, point in the same direction on the $x$ complex plane. However, now let: $\vec{a}=\begin{bmatrix} i\\  1 \end{bmatrix}$ ...and... $\vec{b}=\begin{bmatrix} 2+3i\\  1+i \end{bmatrix}$ ...then $\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}=4+i$ .

I have come across the functions $\sinh(x)$ and $\cosh(x)$ multiple times while studying math including: $(1)$ Lorentz Transformations $(2)$ Integrals and Identities $(3)$ Complex Analysis. Taken at face value, I understand these functions and their definitions $-$ but I feel like I'm missing the point. What is a natural way for me to understand these functions as intuitively as I understand $\sin(x)$ and $\cos(x).$ Note: I have consulted other answers looking for the answer to this question. I am searching for a more fundamental explanation of how these functions came about analogous to the natural representations of $\sin$ and $\cos$ in terms of angles on the unit circle. Of course If I overlooked such an explanation, please simply point me to it.",,"['geometry', 'functions', 'hyperbolic-geometry']"

Then there exists a line $n$ perpendicular to $l$ (and therefore parallel to $t$) which passes through the interior of side $\overline{AC}$ (and therefore the interior of the triangle).

Let $D$ , $E$ , and $F$ be the midpoints of $AI$ , $BI$ , and $CI$ , respectively. Furthermore, let $J$ be the intersection of $AE$ and $BD$ , $K$ be the intersection of $BF$ and $CE$ , and $L$ be the intersection of $CD$ and $AF$ . Find the area of hexagon $DJEKFL$ . Write your answer in the form $a/b$ , where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers and $\gcd(a, b) = 1$ .​ Answer of this problem is $1/6$ . But my answer is 3/8. Here's My approach Let $M$ be the midpoint of $AB$ . Since triangle $ABC$ is isosceles, $M$ is also the midpoint of $CI$ . Hence, $DM$ is a median of triangle $ADI$ , and $EF$ is a median of triangle $BDI$ . Therefore, by the triangle median property, $DM = 1/2 AD$ and $EF = 1/2 BD$ . Since $I$ is the incenter of triangle $ABC$ , we have angle $AIC = \angle BIC = 90 + \angle C/2$ . Thus, $\angle AID = 180 - \angle AIC = 90 - \angle C/2$ . Similarly, $\angle BID = 90 - \angle C/2$ . Therefore, triangles $AID$ and $BID$ are similar, and we have $AD/BD = AI/BI = \sin(B/2)/\sin(A/2) = \cos(C/2)/\sin(A/2)$ . Since triangle $ABC$ is isosceles, we have $\angle BAC = 90 - \angle C/2$ . Thus, $\sin(A/2) = \cos(BAC/2) = \cos((90 - \angle C/2)/2) = \sin(C/4)/\sqrt2$ . Therefore, $AD/BD = \cos(C/2)/(\sin(C/4) \sqrt2)$ . It follows that $DM/EF = (1/2 AD)/(1/2 BD) = \cos(C/2)/\sin(C/4) \sqrt2$ . By the angle bisector theorem, we have $AE/BE = AC/BC = 1$ . Thus, $J$ is the midpoint of $AE$ , and $K$ is the midpoint of $BF$ . Therefore, the line segments $DJ$ and $EK$ divide triangle $DEF$ into three triangles, each of which is similar to triangle $BDI$ . The ratio of the area of triangle $DJK$ to the area of triangle $DEF$ is $(DJ/EJ)^2 = (EK/BK)^2 = (BD/2EF)^2 = (2 \cos(C/2)/\sin(C/4))^2 = 4 \cos^2(C/2)/\sin^2(C/4)$ . The ratio of the area of triangle $DJL$ to the area of triangle $DEF$ is $(DJ/DL)^2 = (1/2 DM/DF)^2 = (\cos(C/2)/\sin(C/4) \sqrt2/EF)^2 = 2 \cos^2(C/2)/\sin^2(C/4)$ . The ratio of the area of triangle $EKL$ to the area of triangle $DEF$ is $(EK/EL)^2 = (1/2 EF/EM)^2 = (1/2 EF/CI)^2 = (1/2 EF/(2EF/\cos(C/2)))^2 = 4 \cos^2(C/2)$ . Therefore, the area of hexagon $DJEKFL$ is the difference between the area of triangle $DEF$ and the sum of the areas of triangles $DJK$ , $DJL$ , and $EKL$ . Hence, $Area(DJEKFL) = (1/2) EF^2 (1 - 4 \cos^2(C/2)/\sin^2(C/4) - 2 \cos^2(C/2)/\sin^2(C/4) - 4 \cos^2(C/2))$ . Substituting $\cos(C/2) = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2(C/2)}$ and $\sin(C/2) = 1/\sqrt{1 + \cot^2(C/2)}$ , we obtain $Area(DJEKFL) = (1/4) (1 - \sin^2(C/4)) (1 + \cos(C/2) - \cos^2(C/2) - 2 \cos^4(C/2))$ . Simplifying, we obtain $Area(DJEKFL) = (1/4) (1 - (1 - \cos(C/2))/(2\sin(C/4))) (2 \cos^4(C/2) - \cos^3(C/2) - \cos^2(C/2) - \cos(C/2) + 1)$ . Simplifying, we obtain $Area(DJEKFL) = (1/16) (2\sin(C/4) + \cos(C/2) - 1) (2 \cos^4(C/2) - \cos^3(C/2) - \cos^2(C/2) - \cos(C/2) + 1)$ . Now, we can use the identity $\cos(2x) = 2\cos^2(x) - 1$ to express $\cos^4(C/2)$ in terms of $\cos(2C)$ : $\cos^4(C/2) = (1/4) (2\cos^2(C/2) - 1)^2 = (1/4) (2\cos^2(C) - 3)^2 = (1/4) (\cos^2(C) - 4\cos^2(C) + 4) = (3/4) - (1/4) \cos^2(C)$ . Similarly, we can use the identity $\cos(3x) = 4\cos^3(x) - 3\cos(x)$ to express $\cos^3(C/2)$ and $\cos^2(C/2)$ in terms of $\cos(C)$ : $\cos^3(C/2) = (1/2) \cos(C/2) (1 + \cos(C)) = (1/2) \sqrt{1 - \sin^2(C/2)} (1 + \cos(C))$ , $\cos^2(C/2) = 1 - \sin^2(C/2) = \cos^2(C/2) - \sin^2(C/2) = \cos(C) - \sin^2(C/2)$ . Substituting these expressions into the formula for the area of hexagon $DJEKFL$ and simplifying, we obtain $Area(DJEKFL) = (3/16) (2\sin(C/4) + \cos(C/2) - 1) (1 - \cos(C) - \cos^2(C/2) - \cos(C/2) + 1)$ . Simplifying further, we obtain $Area(DJEKFL) = (3/16) (2\sin(C/4) + \cos(C/2) - 1) (\sin^2(C/2) - \cos(C/2) - \cos(C) + 1)$ . Finally, we can use the half-angle identity again to express $\sin^2(C/2)$ in terms of $\cos(C/2)$ : $\sin^2(C/2) = (1 - \cos(C))/2$ . Substituting this into the formula for the area of hexagon $DJEKFL$ and simplifying, we obtain $Area(DJEKFL) = (3/32) (\cos(C/2) - 2(8\cos^4(C/4) - 8\cos^2(C/4) + 1) + 2(2\cos^2(C/4) - 1) + 1)$ . Simplifying further, we obtain $Area(DJEKFL) = (3/8) \cos^4(C/4) - (9/8) \cos^2(C/4) + (1/4)$ . Therefore, the area of hexagon $DJEKFL$ is $(3 \cos^4(C/4) - 9 \cos^2(C/4) + 2)/8$ . To write this in the form $a/b$ , we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $8$ to obtain $Area(DJEKFL) = (3 \cos^4(C/4) - 9 \cos^2(C/4) + 2)/8 = (3 \cos^4(C/4) - 9 \cos^2(C/4) + 2)/(2^3) = 3/8 * (\cos^4(C/4) - 3 \cos^2(C/4) + 2/3)$ . Since $\gcd(3, 8) = 1$ , the answer is $3/8 * (\cos^4(C/4) - 3 \cos^2(C/4) + 2/3)$ .","Triangle has a right angle at , and . Let be the incenter of triangle .
