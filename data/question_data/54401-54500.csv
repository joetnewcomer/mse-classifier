1,Asymptotics of the sum $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n^n}$,Asymptotics of the sum,\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n^n},"How does the sum $$f(x)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n^n}$$ behave asymptotically as $x\to\infty$ ?

I apologize for having no work to show on this problem; I have no idea how to begin tackling a problem regarding the asymptotics of a function given its power series (of which there is no hope of evaluating in closed form).

Suppose that $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_nb_n$ converges for any sequence $(b_n)$ such that $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} b_n=0$. Show that $\sum |a_n|<\infty$. Hint he gave me was to use Banach-Steinhaus theorem (a.k.a. uniform boundedness principle). I would like to know whether there are different solutions to this, in particular, whether there is an elementary solution. (Using just calculus, without resorting to more advanced results from functional analysis or other areas.) The argument using Banach-Steinhaus theorem goes as follows: Let $a=(a_n)$ be a given (fixed) sequence such that $\sum a_nb_n$ converges for each $b=(b_n)\in c_0$. For every $n$ we can define $f_n\colon c_0\to{\mathbb R}$ as $\sum_{k=1}^n a_nb_n$. We consider $c_0$ with the usual sup-norm, which makes $c_0$ into a Banach space. Each function $f_n$ is obviously linear. For any $b\in c_0$ such that $\|b\|=\sup\limits_{n\in\mathbb N} |b_n| \le 1$ we have $$|f_n(b)| \le \sum_{k=0}^n |a_k|.$$ This shows that all functions $f_n$ are bounded linear functionals. Now if we fix some $b=(b_k)\in c_0$ we have $$\left|\sum_{k=0}^n a_kb_k\right| \le \sum_{k=0}^\infty |a_k|\cdot |b_k|.$$ The sum on the RHS is finite, since it can be expressed as $\sum a_kc_k$, where $c_k=\pm b_k$. (The choice of sign here depends on the signs of $b_k$ and $a_k$.) So we have shown that at each point $b\in c_0$ the values $f_n(b)$ are bounded by the same constant (depending only on $b$). By Banach-Steinhaus theorem we have that there exists a constant $M$ such that $\|f_n\|<M$ for each $n\in\mathbb N$. Now it only remains to show that $\|f_n\|=\sum_{k=0}^n |a_k|$. We already know that $\|f_n\|\le\sum_{k=0}^n |a_k|$. The other inequality can be obtained by choosing $b$ in unit ball, such that $b_k$ is either $1$ or $-1$, depending on the sign of $a_k$ for $k=1,2,\dots,n$; and $b_k=0$ for $k>n$.

99,Solving for $\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \frac{n^3}{8^n}$?,Solving for ?,\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \frac{n^3}{8^n},"I was trying to solve $ \displaystyle \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \frac{n^3}{8^n}$ and I found a way to solve it and I want if there are generalizations for, say, $\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{n^k}{a^n}$ in terms of $k$ and $a$. I would also like to know if there is  a better way to solve it. Here's how I did it: First I decomposed the series into the following sums: $S_1  = \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{64} + \dots = \frac{\frac{1}{8}}{\frac{7}{8}}$ $S_2 = \frac{7}{64} + \frac{7}{512} + \dots = \frac{\frac{7}{64}}{\frac{7}{8}}$ $S_3 = \frac{19}{512} + \frac{19}{4096} + \dots = \frac{\frac{19}{512}}{\frac{7}{8}}$ And deduced that the sum can be written as $\frac{8}{7} \displaystyle \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \frac{3n^2 - 3n + 1}{8^n}$ $\displaystyle \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{8^n}$ is easy to evaluate -- it's $\frac{1}{7} $by geometric series $\displaystyle \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \frac{n}{8^n}$ can be evaluated in a whole host of ways to get an answer of $\frac{8}{49}$. It remains to evaluate $\displaystyle \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \frac{n^2}{8^n}$, for which I took a similar approach as the cubics by decomposing it into many sums: $T_1 = \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{64} + \dots = \frac{\frac{1}{8}}{\frac{7}{8}}$ $T_2 = \frac{3}{64} + \frac{3}{512} + \dots = \frac{\frac{3}{64}}{\frac{7}{8}}$ And so forth, coming to the conclusion that it is equal to $\frac{8}{7} \displaystyle \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \frac{2n-1}{8^n}$ Now, I used this information and the above values for $\displaystyle \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{8^n}$ and $\displaystyle \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \frac{n}{8^n}$ to get the sum as $\frac{776}{2401}$, which is confirmed by WA.
