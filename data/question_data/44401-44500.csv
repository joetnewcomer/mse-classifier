The entire exercise is quoted below: Let $G$ be a finite group of automorphisms of a ring $A$ , and let $A^G$ denote the subring of $G$ -invariants, that is of all $x \in A$ such that $\sigma(x) = x$ for all $\sigma \in G$ . Prove that $A$ is integral over $A^G$ . [If $x \in A$ , observe that $x$ is a root of the polynomial $\prod_{\sigma \in G} (t - \sigma(x))$ .] Let $S$ be a multiplicatively closed subset of $A$ such that $\sigma(S) \subset S$ for all $\sigma \in G$ , and let $S^G = S \cap A^G$ . Show that the action of $G$ on $A$ extends to an action on $S^{-1} A$ , and that $(S^G)^{-1} A^G \cong (S^{-1} A)^G$ . The piece that I am stuck on is proving that $(S^G)^{-1} A^G \cong (S^{-1} A)^G$ . I have tried two approaches: Using the universal property of localizations, and defining the ""obvious"" map $\phi : (S^G)^{-1} A^G \to (S^{-1} A)^G$ via $\frac{a}{s} \mapsto \frac{a}{s}$ . In both cases, the issue I run into is that I need to show that any $\frac{a}{s} \in (S^{-1} A)^G$ , is equal to $\frac{a'}{s'}$ , where $a' \in A^G$ and $s' \in S^G$ . My best attempt so far is to start with $\frac{a}{s} \in (S^{-1} A)^G$ , and note that $$\frac{a}{s} = \frac{\prod_{\sigma \in G, \sigma \neq 1} \sigma(s) a}{\prod_{\sigma \in G} \sigma(s)}.$$ Clearly the denominator is in $S^G$ . For the numerator, if $A$ is an integral domain , then since $\frac{a}{s} \in (S^{-1} A)^G$ , we have that $\sigma(a)s - \sigma(s)a = 0$ . I can use this to show that the numerator is in $A^G$ by applying $\sigma$ to the numerator, and noting that if $\sigma \neq 1$ , then we get $s \sigma(a) \prod_{\tau \in G, \tau \neq \sigma,1} \tau(s) = a\prod_{\tau \in G, \tau \neq 1} \tau(s)$ , so the numerator is in $A^G$ . If $A$ is not an integral domain, then we get only that there exists $s_\sigma \in S$ such that $(\sigma(a) s - \sigma(s) a)s_\sigma = 0$ , and we have that $(\prod_{\sigma \in G} s_\sigma)(\prod_{\sigma \in G, \sigma \neq 1} \sigma(s))a \in A^G$ , but then we need to show that $(\prod_{\sigma \in G} s_\sigma) \in S^G$ . Is there a way to do this, or am I missing a simpler approach?","I am stuck on one part of Exercise 5.12 in Atiyah Macdonald.

2,Choosing elements from an abelian group $\mathbb{Z}_n$ that make the enumeration of partitions incomplete.,Choosing elements from an abelian group  that make the enumeration of partitions incomplete.,\mathbb{Z}_n,"Take an abelian group $(\mathbb{Z}_n,+)$ and enumerate all partitions of two elements (i.e. $x=x_1+x_2$ ) of each element $\{0,1,...,n-1\}=\mathbb{Z}_n$ . Take, for example, abelian groups $\mathbb{Z}_9$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{10}$ . Now, the enumerations of the partitions of these groups would be the following (note that $x=x_1+x_2$ where $x_1=x_2$ is not allowed, i.e. $x_1$ and $x_2$ may not be equal!): $\mathbb{Z}_9:$ $0=8+1,7+2,6+3,5+4$ $1=8+2,7+3,6+4,0+1$ $2=8+3,7+4,6+5,0+2$ $3=8+4,7+5,0+3,1+2$ $4=8+5,7+6,0+4,1+3$ $5=8+6,0+5,1+4,2+3$ $6=8+7,0+6,1+5,2+4$ $7=0+7,1+6,2+5,3+4$ $8=0+8,1+7,2+6,3+5$ $\mathbb{Z}_{10}:$ $0=9+1,8+2,7+3,6+4$ $1=9+2,8+3,7+4,6+5,0+1$ $2=9+3,8+4,7+5,0+2$ $3=9+4,8+5,7+6,0+3,1+2$ $4=9+5,8+6,0+4,1+3$ $5=9+6,8+7,0+5,1+4,2+3$ $6=9+7,0+6,1+5,2+4$ $7=9+8,0+7,1+6,2+5,3+4$ $8=0+8,1+7,2+6,3+5$ $9=0+9,1+8,2+7,3+6,4+5$ Now, my question is the following: how many ways can we choose the total of $\lfloor \frac{n-1}{2}\rfloor$ distinct elements from $\mathbb{Z}_n$ such that when these elements are deleted, there exists at least one remaining element in $\mathbb{Z}_n$ that may not be expressed as a partition $x=x_1+x_2$ anymore. For instance, if we look at $\mathbb{Z}_9$ then $\lfloor \frac{9-1}{2} \rfloor=4$ and if we delete $\{8,2,3,5\}$ from $\mathbb{Z}_9$ then we cannot express $0$ as a partition $0=x_1+x_2$ where $x_1,x_2\in \mathbb{Z}_9 \setminus \{8,2,3,5\}$ . I noticed that no $\lfloor \frac{n-1}{2} \rfloor$ consecutive elements may be deleted from $\mathbb{Z}_n$ so there must be at least $n$ different ways to do this.

3,"Counterexample to ""kernel determines image""","Counterexample to ""kernel determines image""",,"Working over a base field, there is a typical homomorphism theorem for affine algebraic groups ensuring that any two homomporphisms $G \to H_1$ , $G \to H_2$ with the same kernel in $G$ have isomorphic images. Proving this makes heavily use of the nontrivial fact that injective homomorphisms between Hopf algebras over fields are faithfully flat. Working over general base rings (which are not fields), it is easy to find non-faithfully flat injective Hopf algebra homomorphisms: For example over the base ring of integers, $\mathbb{Z}[X] \to \mathbb{Z}[X]$ sending $X$ to $nX$ for any $n \not\in \{0,1,-1\}$ is not faithfully flat. (It corresponds to the multiplication-by- $n$ -homomorphism $\mathbb{G}_a \to \mathbb{G}_a$ .) I suspect the above statement fails in this general setting, but I cound not find any counterexample so far. Question 1: Are there homomorphisms $f_1 \colon G \to H_1$ , $f_2 \colon G \to H_2$ of affine algebraic groups with the same kernel such that $\mathrm{Im}(f_1)$ is not isomorphic to $\mathrm{Im}(f_2)$ ? More specifically: Question 2: Is there an injective homomorphism $f \colon G \to H$ of affine algebraic groups such that $\mathrm{Im}(f)$ is not isomorphic to $G$ ? Edit 1 Here is an attempt to find a counterexample to question 2. My idea is to adapt known homomorphisms of algebraic groups which can be defined over general base rings but show different behavior after base extensions to fields of different characteristics. For any base ring $R$ there is the circle group $C$ defined for any $R$ -algebra $A$ by $$ C(A) = \{ (x,y) \in A^2 : x^2+y^2 = 1 \}. $$ The identity element is $(1,0)$ , and the group operations are given by $$ (x_1,y_1) \cdot (x_2,y_2) = (x_1x_2 - y_1y_2, x_1y_2+ x_2y_1), \text{ and } (x,y)^{-1} = (x,-y). $$ If $R$ has an element $i \in R$ with $i^2 = -1$ , there is a homomorphism $$ \varphi \colon C \to \mathbb{G}_m, \quad (x,y) \mapsto x+iy.$$ This morphism is quite exiting: If $2$ is invertible in $R$ then $\varphi$ is already an isomorphism. If $2$ not not invertible however, then $\varphi$ is not injective, and we can extend $R$ to a field of characteristics 2, where $\varphi$ is neither injective nor surjective (it maps onto $\mu_2$ then). This example can be found in [Waterhouse, Introduction to affine group schemes, chapter 1, exercise 11]. Since $\varphi$ has nontrivial kernel, it cannot be a counterexample to (2). So let's add an additional equation: Let $C'$ be the subgroup of the circle group given by $$ C'(A) = \{ (x,y) \in A^2 : x^2+y^2=1, 3y=0 \}. $$ Now the restriction of $\varphi$ to $C'$ has trivial kernel, but it is not surjective anymore - we have to add at least one additional equation $3t^2=3$ to $\mathbb{G}_m$ . That is, $\varphi$ induces a homomorphism of algebraic subgroups $$ \{ (x,y) : x^2+y^2=1, 3y = 0 \} \to \{ t : t \text{ invertible}, 3t^2=3 \}. $$ I think this might be a counterexample to (2) since it becomes an isomorphism after extending the base ring to any field, but I cannot see how it should be an isomorphism over (say) the Gaussian integers $R = \mathbb{Z}[i]$ . However, I also cannot see at the moment why it should be (scheme-theoretically) surjective. To restate the question in terms of Hopf algebras: There is a homomorphism $$ (\mathbb{Z}[i])[T,T^{-1}]/(3(T^2-1)) \to (\mathbb{Z}[i])[X,Y]/(X^2+Y^2-1, 3Y), \quad T \mapsto X+iY. $$ Is this morphism injective but not surjective? (Of course (2) asks for a little bit more: Is the left hand side not ismomorphic to the right hand side?) Edit 2 Unfortunately, this specific morphism is already an isomorphism which can be easily seen by condiering the localizations of $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ at all primes $\mathfrak{p}$ . For all primes with $3 \notin \mathfrak{p}$ it is quite obvious that the morphism is basically the same as the identity map $\mu_2 \to \mu_2$ , since $3$ is invertible in $\mathbb{Z}[i]_\mathfrak{p}$ . On the other hand, if $3 \in \mathfrak{p}$ then $2$ is invertible in $\mathbb{Z}[i]_\mathfrak{p}$ . In this case, $\varphi \colon C \to \mathbb{G}_m$ is an isomorphism, and it can be easily checked that its inverse maps $\{ t : t \text{ invertible }, 3t^2=3 \}$ to $C'$ . In order to get a counterexample in the way sketched above, we have to choose some other equation (instead of $3y=0$ ) which nontrivially affects the groups over the base ring $\mathbb{Z}[i]_\mathfrak{p}$ for $\mathfrak{p} = (1+i)$ .","Working over a base field, there is a typical homomorphism theorem for affine algebraic groups ensuring that any two homomporphisms , with the same kernel in have isomorphic images.

Recall that a positive primitive (pp) $\mathcal{L}_R$ -formula is one of the form $\exists\overline{w}\bigwedge_{i=1}^k\overline{r_i}\bullet\overline{v}=\overline{s_i}\bullet\overline{w}$ , where each $\overline{r_i}$ and $\overline{s_i}$ is a tuple of elements of $R$ , and $\bullet$ denotes the ""dot product"". (So, eg, $\overline{r_i}\bullet\overline{v}=\sum_{j=1}^mr_{ij}\cdot v_j$ .) It is well-known that, modulo the complete theory of any $R$ -module, every $\mathcal{L}_R$ -formula is equivalent to a boolean combination of pp-formulas. Given a pair of modules $N\leqslant M$ , we say that $N$ is a pure submodule of $M$ , denoted $N\preccurlyeq^+M$ , if $$N\models\psi(\overline{a})\iff M\models\psi(\overline{a})$$ for any pp-formula $\psi$ and any tuple $\overline{a}\in N$ . (Note that the forward implication always holds, so the content of purity is the backwards implication.) Question: When checking that $N$ is a pure submodule of $M$ , does it suffice to consider pp-formulas in a single variable? $\square$ This seems like a very natural and straightforward question, but the answer is unclear to me. Certainly if $\psi$ is of the form $\exists\overline{w}(\overline{r}\bullet\overline{v}=\overline{s}\bullet\overline{w})$ then the desired implications hold. Indeed, then the sentence $\psi(\overline{a})$ for a tuple $\overline{a}\in N$ is equivalent to the sentence $\psi'(a^1)$ , where $a^1=\overline{r}\bullet\overline{a}\in N$ and $\psi'$ is the single-variable formula $\exists \overline{w}(v=\overline{s}\bullet\overline{w})$ . However, things seem less straightforward if $\psi$ has multiple conjuncts. By a similar argument as above (considering each $\overline{r_i}\bullet\overline{a}$ as a single element of $N$ ), it suffices to consider formulas of the form $\exists\overline{w}\bigwedge_{i=1}^kv_i=\overline{s_i}\bullet\overline{w}$ . Then saying that $N$ is pure in $M$ with respect to formulas in one variable amounts to saying that each equation $a_i=\overline{s_i}\bullet\overline{w}$ has a solution in $N$ if and only if it has a solution in $M$ , for every $a_i\in N$ . But I don't immediately see how we can ""stitch"" these solutions together in the way that we want, and I'm not even sure if we can in general. Does anyone have any thoughts? A counterexample, or a proof for a particularly nice class of ring (PIDs perhaps?), would also be much appreciated. For instance, I believe the result holds if $R$ is a local PID. Sketch: suppose $R$ has maximal ideal $(\pi)$ . Then every element of $R$ is associate with a power of $\pi$ , so we may assume that the length of the tuple $\overline{w}$ in the formula above is $1$ , and that each $s_i$ is of the form $\pi^{n_i}$ for some $n_i$ . Then, assuming wlog that $n_1$ is minimal among the $n_i$ , we have $N\models\exists w\bigwedge_{i=1}^ka_i=\pi^{n_i}w$ if and only if $$\text{(i) }a_1\text{ is divisible by }\pi^{n_1}\text{ in }N\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{  and }\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{(ii) }a_i=\pi^{n_i-n_1}a_1\text{ for each }i.$$ Clearly (ii) holds in $N$ if and only if it holds in $M$ , and (i) is covered by the pp-criterion for single variable formulas, and so we are done.","Let any unital ring, and let be the language of left -modules, where each is a unary function symbol.

For $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{R}$ , a friend came up with the idea of expressing $\alpha$ from the second equation and then substituing it in the first one. This gives us the following equivalent characterisation of the equivalence relation: $$(a,b)\equiv (a', b') \iff \exists q\in \mathbb{K}^{*} \text{ such that } 4a+b^2=q^2(4a'+b'^2) \space (*).$$ (notice that this works for all $\mathbb{K}$ s, the case $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{C}$ can be solved much easier by using this, but I didn't really need to think that much for that one since direct computations worked in my context) For real numbers, this rewrites as $(a,b)\equiv (a', b') \iff \operatorname{sgn}(4a+b^2)=\operatorname{sgn}(4a'+b'^2)$ . As a result, there will be three equivalence classes: the parabola $4x+y^2=0$ , its interior and its exterior.

Then if $|G|=n=p_1^{\alpha_1} \cdots p_m^{\alpha_m}$ with $p_i$ primes, as $G$ is abelian, we know that is direct product of its uniques Sylow subgroups $$G=P_1P_2 \cdots P_m$$ Let $K$ be a subgroup of $P_i$ and $f \in Aut(P_i)$ , then we can define $h:G \longrightarrow G$ such that given $a \in G$ and $a=a_1 \cdots a_m$ its unique expresion as a product where $a_j \in P_j$ , $$h(a)=h(a_1\cdots a_m)=a_1 \cdots a_{i-1} f(a_i) a_{i+1} \cdots a_m$$ The function $h$ is a homomorphism because given $a, b \in G$ , if we express $a=a_1 \cdots a_m$ , $b=b_1 \cdots b_m$ in the unique way as specified before, we have that $$ab=(a_1\cdots a_m)(b_1\cdots b_m)=(a_1b_1) \cdots (a_mb_m)$$ and again, because $a_jb_j \in P_j$ , by uniqueness of the expresion we have $$h(ab)=(a_1b_1) \cdots (a_{i-1}b_{i-1}) f(a_ib_i) (a_{i+1}b_{i+1}) \cdots (a_mb_m)=\\=(a_1b_1) \cdots (a_{i-1}b_{i-1}) f(a_i)f(b_i) (a_{i+1}b_{i+1}) \cdots (a_mb_m)=\\=(a_1 \cdots a_{i-1} f(a_i) a_{i+1} \cdots a_m)(b_1 \cdots b_{i-1} f(b_i) b_{i+1} \cdots b_m)=\\=h(a)h(b)$$ Furthermore, $h$ is inyective because if $h(a)=h(b)$ then $$a_1 \cdots a_{i-1} f(a_i) a_{i+1} \cdots a_m=b_1 \cdots b_{i-1} f(b_i) b_{i+1} \cdots b_m$$ and again by uniqueness of the expression of an element of $G$ as a product of elements of $P_j$ we have that $a_j=b_j$ if $j=1, \cdots, i-1,i+1, \cdots m$ and $f(a_i)=f(b_i)$ , and as $f$ is injective, $a_j=b_j$ and $a=b$ . We stated that $G$ is finite so $h$ is onto and we conclude that $h \in Aut(G)$ . Now, we observe that as $K \subset P_i$ and it is a characteristic group of $G$ , $f(K)=h(K)=K$ so $K$ is a characteristic group of $P_i$ . So, we have proven that every subgroup of $P_i$ is characteristic in $P_i$ so by induction hypothesis, every $P_i$ is cyclic and there exists elements $a_1, \cdots, a_m$ in $G$ such that $o(a_i)=p_i^{\alpha_i}$ . Lastly, we observe that as the $\gcd(p_1^{\alpha_1}, \cdots, p_m^{\alpha_m})=1$ and $G$ is abelian, we conclude that $$o(a_1\cdots a_m)=p_1^{\alpha_1} \cdots p_m^{\alpha_m}=|G|$$ and then $G$ is cyclic. My doubts now are if this prove is correct and, in case it is correct, is there a way to prove in an easy way that if $G$ is finite and every subgroup is characteristic then $G$ is abelian?

If $R$ is a Noetherian domain, then by this post any ideal $I$ which does factor into a product of primes, does so uniquely. The ideal class monoid of $R$ is the quotient of the monoid of nonzero ideals of $R$ under multiplication by the equivalence relation $I\sim J$ if there exist $x,y$ so that $(x)I=(y)J$ . If $R$ is also a UFD, irreducible elements are prime, so all nonzero proper principal ideals factor into a product of primes. Therefore, if $I$ factors as a product of primes, it can be factored as a principal ideal times some unique nonprincipal prime ideals $p_1,\dots,p_n$ , and since $(x)I$ also has a unique prime factorization for all nonzero $x\in R$ its ideal class will consist of $\{(x)p_1\cdots p_n:x\in R\}$ . I am wondering if this ever doesn't happen, ie. if there can be an ideal class which is not of the form $\{(x)I\}$ for some ideal $I$ . By the above discussion a necessary requirement is that $I$ does not factor as a product of prime ideals. The ring I'm interested in is $\mathbb{Z}[t,t^{-1}]$ , which has trivial Picard group, so the only invertible ideals are already principal. Another way to think about this question is the following: consider a graph $\Gamma$ with vertices the nonzero ideals of $R$ and a directed edge $I\rightarrow J$ whenever there is some nonzero $x\in R$ so that $J=(x)I$ . The connected components of this graph are the ideal classes of $R$ . Maximal ideals are ""roots"", so is any product of nonprincipal prime ideals, and by the above they are the only roots of their connected components. I would like an example of an ideal class which has more than one root. Otherwise, every ideal class has a unique root $I$ , and the only ideals $J\sim I$ are of the form $J=(x)I$ , which is not very interesting. A case of two roots in the same component will yield an equation $(x)I=(y)J$ , where $I$ and $J$ are not both principal ideal multiples of a third ideal $K$ , so this is a particular way an ideal can have distinct factorizations, hence the original question.

I've only found a way which involves finding the exact roots and that's nearly impossible for $\deg f\ge 5$.

Given an irreducible polynomial $f\in\mathbb{Q}[X]$ with $f\neq X$ such that $(p_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is periodic with period $d$, let $\alpha$ be a root of $f$ and define $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ by: $$a_n=p_n(\alpha)$$ We can also define $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ by: $$a_0=\alpha$$ $$a_{n+1}=a_n^2-2$$ and if we take $\beta$ with $\alpha=\beta+\beta^{-1}$, then it can easily be shown via induction that  $$a_n=\beta^{2^n}+\beta^{-2^n}$$ Suppose $|\beta|\neq 1$. If $|\beta|<1$, exchange $\beta$ and $\beta^{-1}$, so we can be sure that $|\beta|>1$ and $|\beta^{-1}|<1$. It follows that: $$|\alpha|=\lim_{k\to\infty} |a_{kd}|=\lim_{k\to\infty}|\beta^{2^{kd}}+\beta^{-2^{kd}}|=\infty$$ Which is a contradiction. Therefore, $\beta=e^{i\gamma}$ for some $\gamma\in\mathbb{R}$ and: $$a_n=e^{i\gamma n}+e^{-i\gamma n}=2\cos(\gamma n)$$ Which is only periodic if $\gamma$ is a rational multiple of $2\pi$. The only $f$ we have't checked is $f=X$, but it is easily seen that $p_n\equiv 2\pmod X$ for all $n$. So $(p_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ can only be periodic modulo $f$ when all the roots of $f$ are of the form: $$2\cos\left(\frac{2\pi p}{q}\right)$$ for some $p/q\in\mathbb{Q}$. On the other hand, if for some $p/q\in\mathbb{Q}$ we take $$\alpha:=2\cos\left(\frac{2\pi p}{q}\right)$$ Then we can define $(a_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ as before and show it's periodic, say with period $d$. For all $k,m$, we now have: $$p_k(\alpha)=p_{k+md}(\alpha)\implies (p_{k+md}-p_k)(\alpha)=0$$ and since for $m\neq 0$, we have $\deg p_k\neq \deg p_{k+md}$, it follows that $f^{\alpha}_{\mathbb{Q}}\mid p_{k+md}-p_k$. This implies that all such $\alpha$ are algebraïc over $\mathbb{Q}$ and if a monic irreducible $f\in\mathbb{Q}[X]$ has just one root of the form $$2\cos\left(\frac{2\pi p}{q}\right)$$ then all of its roots are of this form (because it's a unity times $f^{\alpha}_{\mathbb{Q}}$, the sequence is periodic modulo $f^\alpha_{\mathbb{Q}}$ and can only be periodic if all roots are of this form.","This is just an interesting problem I found in an old notebook of mine: Given an irreducible $f\in\mathbb{Q}[X]$, is there a way to determine whether   the sequence $(p_n)_{n=0}^{\infty}\subset \mathbb{Q}[X]$ given by:   $$p_0=X$$ $$p_{n+1}=p_n^2-2$$ is periodic modulo $f$, without first having to determine the roots of $f$?

41,Define $A^{-1}$ (in some cases) even if $A$ is not an invertible matrix,Define  (in some cases) even if  is not an invertible matrix,A^{-1} A,"$\def\r{\Bbb R}$  $\def\q{\Bbb Q}$ As the title suggest, I am trying to do something that I know cannot be done, so my question is confused, and I am trying to make sense of it. Generally: (1) How does one make sense of what I describe below, and (2) are there known results and known terminology applicable, related to my comments? (I am tempted to think of some generalizations of rings, monoids, but I can't make sense of it without using a unit.) So, I was reading about irreducible matrices (and relations to strongly connected graphs, online), after starting with the book Dynamical Systems and Ergodic Theory by Pollicott and Yuri. As an example of an irreducible matrix they give  $A=\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$. Since the first two rows coincide, clearly $\det(A)=0$ and $A$ is not invertible. Nevertheless one may look at powers $A^n$ of $A$, as well as at $A^n-A^{n-1}$.  Certainly this is possible for $n\ge2$, and my computer (using computer algebra Reduce) happily evaluates the case $n=1$ too, as $A^1-A^{1-1}=\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}$ (obviously using $A^{1-1}=I=\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$), but the case $n=0$,  that is $A^0-A^{-1}$ generates an error message ``Singular matrix'' (of course, as $A^{-1}$ does not exist). But, it turns out $A^{n+1}-A^n= A^{n-1}$ for $n\ge2$. For example, $n=2$, then $A^3=\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 2 \\ 1 & 2 & 2 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$, and $A^3-A^2=\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}= A^1$. $n=3$, then $A^4=\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 & 3 \\ 2 & 3 & 3 \\ 1 & 2 & 2 \end{pmatrix}$, and $A^4-A^3=\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}= A^2$. $n=4$, then $A^5=\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 5 & 5 \\ 3 & 5 & 5 \\ 2 & 3 & 3 \end{pmatrix}$, and $A^5-A^4=\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 2 \\ 1 & 2 & 2 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}= A^3$. $n=5$, then $A^6=\begin{pmatrix} 5 & 8 & 8 \\ 5 & 8 & 8 \\ 3 & 5 & 5 \end{pmatrix}$, and $A^6-A^5=\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 & 3 \\ 2 & 3 & 3 \\ 1 & 2 & 2 \end{pmatrix}= A^4$. (As seen the Fibonacci numbers are involved too.) From the above, one if tempted to (recursively) define $A^{n-1}=A^{n+1}-A^n$ for all $n\le1$. For example, $A^0=A^2-A^1 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\ -1 & 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \not= I$. Even though $A^0$, defined this way, is different from $I$, it acts like $I$ when multiplied to $A^n$, $n\ge1$. For example, $A^0\cdot A=A\cdot A^0=A$, $A^0\cdot A^7=A^7\cdot A^0=A^7$, etc. Also, $(A^0)^2=A^0$, and $(A^0)^n=A^0$ for $n\ge1$. Similarly, one may define $A^{-1}=A^1-A^0 = \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 & 1 \\ -1 & 1 & 1 \\ 2 & -1 & -1 \end{pmatrix}$. (And, one may define $A^{-n}$ for all $n\ge1$.) Even though $A$ is not invertible, the $A^{-1}$ as defined above behaves like an inverse of $A$, namely $A^{-1}\cdot A=A\cdot A^{-1}=A^0 =  \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\ -1 & 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$. So, my (confused) question (in addition to (1) and (2) at the beginning) is:  (3) What am I observing (assuming it has already observed and is well-known)? Edit. I think I understand better what I was asking (or what had confused me) and will post my comments here. This is essentially an answer, but I will leave the option open for someone else to post their answer, as they find appropriate, as the question was a bit open ended, and may get different types of answers.  (Also, after typing this edit, I feel there are more details to be verified.) QiaochuYuan left a comment which I initially did not understand, but now I think he meant something along what is illustrated by the following example. Let $F=\{\begin{pmatrix} x & 0  \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}: x\in\r\}$. Then $F$ is a field isomorphic to $\r$, with additive identity $O=\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0  \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$ and multiplicative identity $U=\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0  \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$, and if $X=\begin{pmatrix} x & 0  \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}\not=O$ then $X^{-1}=\begin{pmatrix} x^{-1} & 0  \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$. The latter does not contradict the fact that $\begin{pmatrix} x & 0  \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$, as a matrix, is not invertible. If $Id=\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0  \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$ is the identity matrix, this looks like a contradiction, having two different multiplicative identities, namely $U$ and $Id$, but there is no contradiction as simply $Id$ does not belong to $F$. It didn't seem that QiaochuYuan addressed the identity $A^{n+1}-A^n= A^{n-1}$ for $n\ge2$ (and the latter seemed special to me). Let $E= \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\ -1 & 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$ (which I had denoted by $A^0$ above, but I prefer $E$ now). $E$ is the multiplicative identity of the structure described in my question, and I was puzzled as it looked like there were two different multiplicative identities, namely $E$, and $I= \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$. It seemed to me that if we use the usual matrix multiplication, then there was only one choice for the multiplicative identity, namely $I$. The matrix $E$ isn't even a diagonal matrix, and it looked strange it would be a multiplicative identity  (and I must have forgotten that matrices have normal forms). Well, I verified the details later, and $E$ is indeed the multiplicative identity, while $I$ simply does not belong to this structure. Call the structure hinted at in my question $K$. So $K$ contains  $A=\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$ as well as  all $A^n$, $n\ge1$ (usual matrix multiplication). We have that $A^{n-1}=A^{n+1}-A^n$ for all $n\ge2$, and this suggest that $E=A^2-A= \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\ -1 & 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$ would play the role of the multiplicative identity. Once this is done, we could define the inverse of $A$, as $A-E$ (where $E$ plays the role of $A^0$). I had used the notation $A^{-1}$ in my question, but I confuse myself with that as I think in this context it should be reserved for matrix inverse (which for $A$ does not exist). So, if $n\ge1$, I will denote the multiplicative inverse of $A^n$ (in $K$) by $A^{[-n]}$. In particular, $A^{[-1]}=A-E=\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 & 1 \\ -1 & 1 & 1 \\ 2 & -1 & -1 \end{pmatrix}$, then $A^{[-2]}=E-A^{[-1]}=\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 & -1 \\ 2 & -1 & -1 \\ -3 & 2 & 2 \end{pmatrix}$, next $A^{[-3]}=A^{[-1]}-A^{[-2]}$, etc. (using the identity $A^{n-1}=A^{n+1}-A^n$ as a model). Let $S=\{A^{[-n]}:n\ge1\}\cup\{E\}\cup\{A^n:n\ge1\}$. Then $S$ is a commutative ring under usual matrix multiplication, with identity element $E$. Since of course we could add and subtract the elements of $S$ (as matrices), I was confused that $S$ is a field, and I knew that couldn't be, as the multiplicative group should contain a copy of the rationals $\q$, whereas $S$ seems isomorphic as a group to $(\Bbb Z,+)$. (But it was getting late.) I had simply forgotten that $S$ is not closed under addition (and subtraction).  So $S$ is not a field, but it generates a field. Let $K$ be the field that is generated by $S$. I will present a couple of more specific descriptions of $K$ below. First, every element of $S$ is of the form $\begin{pmatrix} q & r & r \\ q & r & r \\ p & q & q \end{pmatrix}$, with $p+q=r$ (so obviously such an element is completely determined by $p$ and $q$). Every element of $K$ is of this form too, where $p,q,r\in\q$ and $p+q=r$. The operations are usual matrix addition and multiplication, with the usual zero matrix, but with $E$ for the multiplicative identity. Suppose that there is a field isomorphism $h:K\to L \subset \r$. (There is one, indeed, described below.) Let $a=h(A)$, then $1+a=a^2$ since $E+A=A^2$. The solutions for $a$ are the golden section $\varphi=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}2\approx1.618$ and $\psi=\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}2\approx-0.618$. Thus, $K$ is isomorphic to the field extension $\q(\sqrt{5})$ (hmm, I didn't verify if matrix multiplication goes into usual multiplication in $\r$, so I may be wrong, but will keep writing). Let $(p,q)$ abbreviate the matrix $\begin{pmatrix} q & r & r \\ q & r & r \\ p & q & q \end{pmatrix}$, where $p+q=r$. Then $h(E)=h(-1,1)=1$, $h(A)=h(1,0)=a$, and  $h(A^2)=h(0,1)=a^2$. Thus $h(p,q)=pa+qa^2$. Note also that $\pm\sqrt{5}=3a-a^2$. There are two possibilities for $h$. Either (1), $a=\varphi$ and then $h(p,q)=\frac{p+3q}2+\frac{p+q}2\sqrt{5}$, or (2), $a=\psi$ and then $h(p,q)=\frac{p+3q}2-\frac{p+q}2\sqrt{5}$. I feel I didn't verify all details, but it is getting late again. If what I wrote in this edit is incorrect, then the question remains as to explain what the above example is or does.","$\def\r{\Bbb R}$  $\def\q{\Bbb Q}$ As the title suggest, I am trying to do something that I know cannot be done, so my question is confused, and I am trying to make sense of it.

Theorem 2. If $E\supseteq B(\alpha) \supseteq B$ are fields with $\alpha^p \in B$ for some prime $p$, and if $B(\alpha)$ contains no $p$th roots of unity not in $B$ unless a itself is a $p$th root of unity, then $\texttt{Gal}(E/B(\alpha))$ is a normal subgroup of $\texttt{Gal}(E/B)$ and $\texttt{Gal}(E/B)/\texttt{Gal}(E/B(\alpha))$ is abelian. Proof: By the homomorphism theorem for groups, it suffices to find a homomorphism of $\texttt{Gal}(E/B)$, with kernel $\texttt{Gal}(E/B(\alpha))$, into an abelian group (i.e., onto a subgroup of an abelian group, which of course is also abelian). The obvious map with kernel $\texttt{Gal}(E/B(\alpha))$ is restriction to $B(\alpha)$, $\lvert_{B(\alpha)}$, since by definition $$\sigma \in \texttt{Gal}(E/B(\alpha)) \Leftrightarrow \sigma \lvert_{B(\alpha)} \texttt{ is the identity map}.$$ The homomorphism property, $$\sigma' \sigma \lvert_{B(\alpha)}=\sigma'\lvert_{B(\alpha)} \sigma\lvert_{B(\alpha)}, \forall \sigma', \sigma \in \texttt{Gal}(E/B),$$ is automatic provided $\sigma \lvert_{B(\alpha)}(b) \in B(\alpha)$ for each $b \in B(\alpha)$, i.e. provided $B(\alpha)$ is closed under each $\sigma \in \texttt{Gal}(E/B)$. Since $\sigma$ fixes $B$, $\sigma \lvert_{B(\alpha)}$ is completely determined by the value $\sigma(\alpha)$. If $\alpha$ is a $p$th root of unity then $$(\sigma(\alpha))^p = \sigma(\alpha^p) = \sigma(\zeta^p) = \sigma(1) = 1,$$ hence $\sigma(\alpha) = \zeta^i= \alpha^i \in  B(\alpha)$, since each $p$th root of unity is some $\zeta^i$. If $\alpha$ is not a root of unity then $$ (\sigma(\alpha))^p = \sigma(\alpha^p) = \alpha^p \texttt{ since } \alpha^p \in B,$$ hence $\sigma(\alpha) = \zeta^ia$ for some $p$th root of unity $\zeta$; and $\zeta \in B$ by hypothesis, so a\texttt{Gal}in $\sigma(\alpha) \in B(\alpha)$. Thus $B(\alpha)$ is closed as required. This also implies that $I_{B(\alpha)}$ maps $\texttt{Gal}(E/B)$ into $\texttt{Gal}(B(\alpha)/B)$, so it now remains to check that $\texttt{Gal}(B(\alpha)/B)$ is abelian. If $\alpha$ is a root of unity then, as we have just seen, each $\sigma \lvert_{B(\alpha)} \in \texttt{Gal}(B(\alpha)/B)$ is of the form $\sigma_i$, where $\sigma_i(\alpha) = \alpha^i$, hence $$\sigma_i\sigma_j(\alpha) = \sigma_i(\alpha^j) = \alpha^{ij} = \sigma_j\sigma_i(\alpha).$$ Likewise, if $\alpha$ is not a root of unity then each $\sigma \lvert_{B(\alpha)} \in \texttt{Gal}(B(\alpha)/B)$ is of the form $\sigma_i$ where $\sigma_i(\alpha) = \zeta^i\alpha$, hence $$\sigma_i\sigma_j(\alpha) = \sigma_i(\zeta^j\alpha) = \zeta^{i+j}\alpha = \sigma_j\sigma_i(\alpha)$$ since $\zeta \in B$ and therefore $\zeta$ is fixed.

Determine the Galois group of the splitting field of  over the fields  and .,f(x)=x^8-16 f(x) \Bbb{Q} \Bbb{Z}_{17},"Let $f(x)=x^8-16$ . Determine the Galois group of the splitting field of $f(x)$ over the field $K$ in each case. a) $K=\Bbb{Q}$ b) $K=\Bbb{F}_{17}$ . a) The roots of $f(x)$ are $\alpha$ , $\alpha\omega$ , $\alpha\omega^2$ , ... , $\alpha\omega^7$ where $\alpha=16^{1/8} = (2^4)^{1/8} = 2^{1/2}$ and $\omega$ is the $8$ th primitive root of unity. First we need to find the degree of the extension since it is equal to the order of the Galois group. We have $$[\Bbb{Q}(\alpha,\omega):\Bbb{Q}]=[\Bbb{Q}(\alpha,\omega):\Bbb{Q}(\omega)][\Bbb{Q}(\omega):\Bbb{Q}],$$ where $[\Bbb{Q}(\omega):\Bbb{Q}]=\Psi_8(x)$ , where $\Psi_k(x)$ is the $k$ th cyclotomic polynomial. We know that $$x^8-1 = \Psi_1(x)\Psi_2(x)\Psi_4(x)\Psi_8(x)$$ $$\implies x^8-1 = (x-1)(x+1)(x^2+1)\Psi_8(x)$$ $$\implies \Psi_8(x)=x^4+1$$ Since cyclotomic polynomials are irreducible over $\Bbb{Q}$ , we know that $[\Bbb{Q}(\omega):\Bbb{Q}]=4$ . Now we need to find $[\Bbb{Q}(\omega,\alpha):\Bbb{Q}(\omega)]$ . Since $\alpha$ is a root of $x^8-16$ , the minimal polynomial must be a divisor of it. We have $x^8-16 = (x^2-2)(x^2+2)(x^4+4)$ . Here, we can see that $\alpha$ is a root of $x^2-2$ , so we just need to check if $x^2-2$ is reducible. But $x^2-2=(x-\sqrt{2})(x+\sqrt{2})$ , and we know that $\sqrt{2} \not\in \Bbb{Q}(\omega)$ since it is irrational. So $[\Bbb{Q}(\omega,\alpha):\Bbb{Q}(\omega)]=2 \implies [K:\Bbb{Q}]=8$ There are five groups of order 8 up to isomorphism: $\bullet \Bbb{Z}_8$ $\bullet \Bbb{Z}_4 \times \Bbb{Z}_2$ $\bullet \Bbb{Z}_2 \times \Bbb{Z}_2 \times \Bbb{Z}_2$ $\bullet D_8$ $\bullet Q_8$ Since $x^8-16 = (x^2-2)(x^2+2)(x^4+4)$ , the automorphisms are $$\sigma_1: \alpha \rightarrow -\alpha$$ $$\sigma_2: \alpha\omega^2 \rightarrow \alpha\omega^6$$ $$\sigma_3: \alpha\omega \rightarrow \alpha\omega^3$$ $$\sigma_4: \alpha\omega \rightarrow \alpha\omega^5$$ $$\sigma_5: \alpha\omega \rightarrow \alpha\omega^7$$ $$\sigma_6: \alpha\omega^3 \rightarrow \alpha\omega^5$$ $$\sigma_7: \alpha\omega^3 \rightarrow \alpha\omega^7$$ $$\sigma_8: \alpha\omega^5 \rightarrow \alpha\omega^7$$ I guess I can tell which group of order 8 this is isomrophic to by direct computation, but I was kind of confused...for example, let's say I want to check if $\sigma_3\sigma_2(\sigma\omega) = \sigma_2\sigma_3(\alpha\omega)$ . But $\sigma_2$ takes $\sigma\omega^2$ to $\alpha\omega^6$ . But we don't have $\alpha\omega^2$ , we have $\alpha\omega$ . If we just raise it to the 3rd power, then what's the difference between $\sigma_2$ and $\sigma_3$ ? So that doesn't really make sense to me... Also is there an easier way find out which group it's isomorphic to without actually having to directly go through all the elements and subgroups of the Galois group? b) As in part a) we hav $$[\Bbb{F}_{17}(\alpha,\omega):\Bbb{F}_{17}]=[\Bbb{F}_{17}(\alpha,\omega):\Bbb{F}_{17}(\omega)][\Bbb{F}_{17}(\omega):\Bbb{F}_{17}].$$ So, again, we need to check if $\Psi_8(x) = x^4+1$ is irreducible in $\Bbb{F}_{17}$ . In other words, since $x^4+1=0 \implies x^4=-1 \implies x^8=1$ , we need to check if there are elements of order 8 in $\Bbb{F}_{17}$ . We know that the multiplicative group of $\Bbb{F}_{17}$ is cyclic of order $16$ . So we have a cyclic subgroup of order 8 $\implies$ the minimal polynomial of $\omega$ over $\Bbb{F}_{17}$ is of degree 1 $\implies$ $[\Bbb{F}_{17}(\omega):\Bbb{F}_{17}]=1$ . For $[\Bbb{F}_{17}(\alpha,\omega):\Bbb{F}_{17}(\omega)]$ , we get the same polynomial as we did for part a), which is not reducible since $x^2-2=(x-\sqrt{2})(x+\sqrt{2})$ and $\sqrt{2} \notin\Bbb{F}_{17}$ .

Then one of its Sylow subgroups is normal.,,"Let G be a group of order 24 that is not isomorphic to S4. Then   one of its Sylow subgroups is normal. This is the proof from my textbook . Proof Suppose that the 3-Sylow subgroups are not normal. The number of 3-Sylow subgroups is 1 mod 3 and divides 8. Thus, if there is more than one 3-Sylow subgroup, there must be four of them. Let X be the set of 3-Sylow subgroups of G. Then G acts on X by conjugation, so we get a homomorphism $f : G → S(X) \cong S_4$. As we’ve seen in the discussion on G-sets, the kernel of f is the intersection of the isotropy subgroups of the elements of X. Moreover, since the action is that given by conjugation, the isotropy subgroup of H ∈ X is $N_G(H)$ (the normalizer of H in G). Thus, $$ker f = \cap_{H \in X} N_G(H).$$ For H ∈ X, the index of $N_G(H)$ is 4, the number of conjugates of H. Thus, the order of $N_G(H)$ is 6. Suppose that K is a different element of X. We claim that the order of $N_G(H) \cap N_G(K)$ divides 2. To see this, note that the order of $N_G(H) \cap N_G(K)$ cannot be divisible by 3. This is because any p-group contained in the normalizer of a p-Sylow subgroup must be contained in the p-Sylow subgroup itself (Corollary 5.3.5). Since the 3-Sylow subgroups have prime order here, they cannot intersect unless they are equal. But if the order of $N_G(H) \cap N_G(K)$ divides 6 and is not divisible by 3, it must divide 2. In consequence, we see that the order of the kernel of f divides 2. If the kernel has order 1, then f is an isomorphism, since G and $S_4$ have the same number of elements. Thus, we shall assume that ker f has order 2. In this case, the image of f has order 12. But by Problem 2 of Exercises 4.2.18, $A_4$ is the only subgroup of $S_4$ of order 12, so we must have im f = $A_4$. By Problem 1 of Exercises 4.2.18, the 2-Sylow subgroup, $P_2$, of $A_4$ is normal. But since ker f has order 2, $f^{−1}P_2$ has order 8, and must be a 2-Sylow subgroup of G. As the pre-image of a normal subgroup, it must be normal, and we’re done. My Question I'm just confused about the last part. I kind of got lost when it was explaining how/why $f^{-1}P_2$ has order 8. I'm not really sure how that's related to the kernel of f.

My Question I'm just confused about the last part. I kind of got lost when it was explaining how/why $f^{-1}P_2$ has order 8. I'm not really sure how that's related to the kernel of f.

Let $C$ denote the conjugacy class of element $x$ in $G$, $C'$ the conjugacy class of the image of $x$ in $G'$. Prove the order of $C'$ divides the order of $C$. So far, using the class equation I can observe that $|C|$ divides $|G|$ and $|C'|$ divides $|G'|$, and it's also obvious that the homomorphism maps $C$ surjectively to $C'$. But I can't quite piece it all together. Any help appreciated.","There is a surjective homomorphism from $G$ to $G'$.

98,Irreducible polynomial over an algebraically closed field of characteristic distinct from 2,Irreducible polynomial over an algebraically closed field of characteristic distinct from 2,,"Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field such that $\textrm{char(k)} \neq 2$ and let $n$ be a fixed positive integer greater than $3$ Suppose that $m$ is a positive integer such that $3 \leq m \leq n$. Is it always true that $f(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{m})=x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+\cdots+x_{m}^{2}$ is irreducible over $k[x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n}]$? I think yes. For $m=3$ we need to check that $f(x,y,z)=x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}$ is irreducible, yes? can't we use Eisenstein as follows? Note $y+iz$ divides $y^{2}+z^{2}$ and $y+iz$ is irreducible over $k[y,z]$ and $(y+iz)^{2}$ does not divide $y^{2}+z^{2}$. Therefore $f(x,y,z)=x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}$ is irreducible. Now we induct on $m$. Suppose the result holds for $m$ and let us show it holds for $m+1$. So we must look at the polynomial $x_{1}^{2}+\cdots+x_{m}^{2}+x_{m+1}^{2}$. Consider the ring $k[x_{m+1}][x_{1},..,x_{m}]$,  we have a monic polynomial and by hypothesis $x_{1}^{2}+\cdots+x_{m}^{2}$ is irreducible over $k[x_{1},\ldots,x_{m}]$ and $(x_{1}^{2}+\cdots+x_{m}^{2} )^{2}$ does not divides $x_{1}^{2}+\cdots+x_{m}^{2}$ so Eisenstein applies again and we are done. Question(s): Is this OK? In case not, can you please provide a proof?","Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field such that $\textrm{char(k)} \neq 2$ and let $n$ be a fixed positive integer greater than $3$ Suppose that $m$ is a positive integer such that $3 \leq m \leq n$.

99,On Constructions by Marked Straightedge and Compass,On Constructions by Marked Straightedge and Compass,,"Pierpont proved that a regular $n$-gon is constructible by (singly) marked straightedge and compass if and only if $n = k \, p_1 \cdots p_{s}$, where $k = 2^{a_1} 3^{a_2}$ for $a_i \geq 0$ and $p_i = 2^{b_1} 3^{b_2} + 1 > 3$ is prime with $b_i \geq 0$. It has been known since the time of Archimedes that a marked straightedge allows for angle trisection . Let a $q$-sector be an object which allows for angle $q$-section. Does this result generalize to the following? Let $q$ be a prime. A regular $n$-gon is constructible by $q$-sector, straightedge and compass if and only if $n = k \, p_1 \cdots p_{s}$, where $k = 2^{a_1} 3^{a_2} \cdots q^{a_m}$ for $a_i \geq 0$ and $p_i = 2^{b_1} 3^{b_2} \cdots q^{b_m} + 1 > q$ is prime with $b_i \geq 0$. Update : Gleason 's paper provides the complete answer for constructible $n$-gons. Here, it is shown that a regular $n$-gon is constructible by straightedge, compass and $p$-sector for each prime $p$ dividing $\varphi(n)$, the Euler totient of $n$. Thus, I must modify my conjecture to the following: Let $q$ be a prime. A regular $n$-gon is constructible by $\{ 3, 5, \dots, q \}$-sectors, straightedge and compass if and only if $n = k \, p_1 \cdots p_{s}$, where $k = 2^{a_1} 3^{a_2} \cdots q^{a_m}$ for $a_i \geq 0$ and $p_i = 2^{b_1} 3^{b_2} \cdots q^{b_m} + 1 > q$ is prime with $b_i \geq 0$. One direction is certainly true by using the multiplicativity of the Euler totient function. The question is now whether the other direction also holds.","Pierpont proved that a regular $n$-gon is constructible by (singly) marked straightedge and compass if and only if $n = k \, p_1 \cdots p_{s}$, where $k = 2^{a_1} 3^{a_2}$ for $a_i \geq 0$ and $p_i = 2^{b_1} 3^{b_2} + 1 > 3$ is prime with $b_i \geq 0$.
