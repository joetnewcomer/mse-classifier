4,Counterintuitive Charecterization of Openness in Euclidian Topology,Counterintuitive Charecterization of Openness in Euclidian Topology,,"I came across an interesting problem and after playing with it for a few days I made some progress but resorted to looking up some solutions by others. My question is about their solutions , so please read along to the end before answering or commenting. The original problem: Prove or disprove: Consider $\mathbb{R}^2$ with the Euclidean topology and let $X$ be a subset. If for every $a \in X$ and $v \in  \mathbb{R}^2$ there exists $d > 0$ such that $a + tv \in X$ for every $0 \leq t < d$ then $X$ is open. If you haven't seen this problem before you might want to stop now and try it before I spoil the fun, since I am about to list some solutions below. It is a fun problem. Why the problem is interesting: The standard method of showing a set is open is to cover the set in open balls. The hypothesis of this problem naively makes us think we can do that. Given a point $a$ in $X$ and a point $v$ in the plane, by hypothesis there is some open ray starting at $a$ in the direction of $v$ that is contained in $X$ . So if we center a circle around $a$ and construct an open ray in the direction of every point on the circle, we hope to have created something that can be reduced to an open disk around $a$ and contained in $X$ . [Technically to use the hypothesis as stated we first need to  relocate the set $X$ so that $a$ is located at the origin, this makes $a+tv$ actually represent the ray from $a$ in the direction of $v$ , but the ability to construct an open disk around $a$ doesn't depend on the location of $X$ in the plane, so I won't mention this detail again.] This intuition motivated me to try and prove the claim: so let $a \in X$ and let $S$ be a circle of radius one centered on the point $a$ . Let $v$ be an arbitrary point on $S$ and let $$R_v = \{ a+tv \, | \, 0 \leq t < d_v \}$$ be the set of points on the open ray in the direction of $v$ that exists by hypothesis. Now let $$D = \{d_v \, | \, v \in S \}.$$ If $d = \mathrm{min}(D)$ then we can consider $$R_{v_d} =\{ a+tv \, | \, 0 \leq t < d \}$$ and finally $$\bigcup_{v \in S} R_{v_d}$$ is an open disk centered on $a$ contained in $X$ . Problem: most members of this community will have already noticed the issue, the existence of $\mathrm{min}(D)$ is not guarunteed, and it is fairly clear we will not be able to establish such an existence. At this point I abandon trying to prove the claim and begin looking for a set which fails to be open, satisfies the hypothesis, and where $\mathrm{min}(D)$ does not exist. The question: I found hunting for a counterexample much more difficult than attempting to prove the proposition. I have built a large tool belt of standard methods and techniques for trying to prove openness, and trying to prove claims in general, but trying to find a counterexample seemed much more creatively demanding. I am looking for a set that is not open, that satisfies the hypothesis, and something where $\mathrm{min}(D)$ will not exist, since if $\mathrm{min}(D)$ always existed the theorem would be true. After struggling for a few days I looked up solutions: these are what I found: Solution 1: $\mathbb{R}^2 - \{(x,y) \, | \, x^2 + y^2 = 1 \wedge (x,y) \neq (0,1) \}$ . In words: the plane kickout a circle and add back in a point. Solution 2: $\mathbb{R}^2 - \{(x,y) \, | \, y = x^2 \wedge x > 0 \}$ In both solutions there is a point that causes the set to not be open, (0,1) and (0,0) respectively so I agree neither set is open. I intuitively see how the constructions are intended to meet the hypothesis yet fail to have a minimum $d$ : as we swing the ray around, the shape of the curve removed forces the ray to be smaller and smaller, hopefully causing no minimum. I think any counter example to this problem will involve a point with a removed arc leading up to it contained in some larger open set (perhaps $\mathbb{R}^2$ itself). But what I am having trouble fully convincing myself of is: Is there not one single small direction when we pass the ray from below the curve removed to above the curve removed where the length of the ray must be 0? How can we prove that these solutions fully satisfy the hypothesis: that is, for every direction we have the open ray of non zero length? What have a tried: Without fail someone will ask it - so lets just cover it now. I worked with solution 1 and considered the point (0,1). I can parameterize the ray from the point to the removed circle as $$r(t) = (0,1) + t*(v - (0,1))$$ where $v = (cos(x), sin(x)), 0 \leq x < 2\pi$ . It is sufficient to derive an expression for the length of $r(t)$ and show that I can swing $r(t)$ around a full $2\pi$ radians and always have nonzero length. I am not convinced that it can move beyond the point of being parallel to the x axis without going to 0!","I came across an interesting problem and after playing with it for a few days I made some progress but resorted to looking up some solutions by others.

Here is my approach. Since $X$ is path connected, it is enough to show, $\pi_1(X,[(0,0)])$ is trivial. So let $f:[0,1]\to X$ be a loop based at $[(0,0)]$ . Since $[0,1]$ is compact and continuous image of a compact set is compact we have, $f([0,1])$ is a compact subset of $X$ . Hence we have a $1>\delta>0$ such that, image of $f$ is contained in $X_{\delta}$ , where $$X_{\delta}=\frac{\big(\{0\}\times[-1,1]\big)\bigcup\big\{(x,y):\delta\leq x\leq 1,y=\sin\big(\frac{\pi}{x}\big)\big\}}{\{(0,0),(1,0)\}}.$$ Now, $X_{\delta}$ is contractible space.

Proof: $X$ is separable. Let $S=\{x_n \in X | n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ be a countable dense subset of $X$ . $Y$ is also dense in $X$ . Because $X$ is first-countable, thus for each $x_n$ where $n \in \mathbb{N}$ there exists a countable local-basis around $x_n$ . Let the countable local-basis around $x_n$ be $S_n=\{\text{ }B_n^k \text{ } | \text{ }k \in \mathbb{N} \}$ Because $Y$ is dense in $X$ thus for each $x_n$ where $ n=1,2,3 \dots $ and for each $B_n^k$ where $k=1,2,3,4 \dots$ , we have $Y \cap B_n^k \neq \phi$ . Say $y_n^k \in Y \cap B_n^k \neq \phi$ Denote $Z=\{ y_n^k \in Y \text{ } | \text{ } n,k \in \mathbb{N} \}$ Claim: $Z$ is a countable dense set of $Y$ . Choose $y \in Y$ and any open set $V$ in $Y$ containing y. $V$ is open in $Y$ implies that $V=U \cap Y$ where $U$ is an open set in $X$ . Thus $y \in U \in \tau$ and $y \in Y$ $y \in U$ and $U$ is open in X. Because $S$ is dense in X, we have that $U \cap S \neq \phi $ . Let $x_n \in U \cap S$ , Thus $x_n \in U$ and $U$ is open in $X$ . Considering that $S_n$ is a countable local-basis around $x_n$ we have an element $B_n^{k_0}$ such that $x_n \in B_n^{k_0} \subset U$ . choose the corresponding $y_n^{k_0}$ as done in the construction above.

So according to the link, I should start with an element $v_1$ of length 1 in span$(e_1,e_2)$, i.e. $$ v_1(\theta_1)=\cos(\theta_1)e_1+\sin(\theta_2)e_2 $$ Then from there I should choose an element $v_2$ of length $\varepsilon$ in span$(v_1,e_3)$, i.e. $$ v_2(\theta_1,\theta_2)=\varepsilon\cos(\theta_2)v_1(\theta_1)+\varepsilon\sin(\theta_2)e_3 $$ and in general (for $1\leq j\leq k$), set $$ v_j(\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_j)=\varepsilon^{j-1}\cos(\theta_j)v_{j-1}(\theta_1,\ldots ,\theta_j)+\varepsilon^{j-1}\sin(\theta_j)e_{j+1}. $$ From this, the map $$ \Phi:(e^{i\theta_1},\ldots,e^{i\theta_{k}})\mapsto\sum_{j=1}^{k}v_j(\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_j) $$ is supposed to be the necessary embedding. This makes sense intuitively, but I can't seem to prove injectivity. Things Tried The only case I can make any progress is in the case $k=3$. I've tried doing induction and immitating this argument in the inductive step, but it doesn't seem to work. If $k=3$, then $$\Phi(e^{i\theta_1},e^{i\theta_1})=\Phi(e^{i\theta_1'},e^{i\theta_1'})$$   implies   $$ (1+\varepsilon\cos(\theta_2))v_1(\theta_1)+\varepsilon\sin(\theta_2)e_3=(1+\varepsilon\cos(\theta_2'))v_1(\theta_1')+\varepsilon\sin(\theta_2')e_3. $$   In this case the vectors being added together are orthogonal, so taking the norm-square of both sides gives   $$ (1+\varepsilon\cos(\theta_2))^2+\varepsilon^2\sin(\theta_2)=(1+\varepsilon\cos(\theta_2'))^2+\varepsilon^2\sin(\theta_2'), $$   which after simplifying turns into   $$ 2\varepsilon\cos(\theta_2)=2\varepsilon\cos(\theta_2), $$   so $\cos(\theta_2)=\cos(\theta_2')$. This combined with the immediate fact that $\sin(\theta_2)=\sin(\theta_2')$ shows that $\theta_2=\theta_2'$ (in $[0,2\pi)$). The rest follows from the fact that $v_1$ is injective.

58,Is there an uncountable subspace $F \subseteq \omega^{\omega_1}$ which is closed and discrete?,Is there an uncountable subspace  which is closed and discrete?,F \subseteq \omega^{\omega_1},"Does there exist an uncountable subspace $F \subseteq \omega^{\omega_1}$ which is closed and discrete? Edit : I made a couple attempts to solve it, but they didn't get anywhere (also I don't believe they're interesting, but just in case...). The classic argument that the square of the Sorgenfrey line, $X^2$, is not T4 uses the fact that it is separable and has a discrete closed subspace of size $2^{\aleph_0}$. Namely, if it were T4, then by the Tietze extension theorem there would be at least $2^{2^{\aleph_0}}$ continuous functions $X^2 \to \mathbb{R}$. On the other hand, from separability the number of such functions is at most $2^{\aleph_0}$, which is a contradiction, since $2^{\aleph_0} < 2^{2^{\aleph_0}}$. But the analogous argument doesn't seem to work here, firstly because I don't know if $\omega^{\omega_1}$ is normal* (I do know it is separable), secondly because we only get that $2^{\aleph_1} \leqslant |C(\omega^{\omega_1})| \leqslant 2^{\aleph_0}$ and that is consistent with ZFC. I don't know whether $\omega^{\omega_1}$ is a Lindelöf space*. If it is, it follows that the answer is negative: suppose $F \subseteq \omega^{\omega_1}$ is a closed discrete subspace. Then as a closed subspace of a Lindelöf space, it is also Lindelöf, but since it's discrete, it must be countable. Also since $\displaystyle \omega = \bigcup_{n < \omega} n$ and $n^{\omega_1}$ is compact, I feel like $\omega^{\omega_1}$ should be close to being compact in a sense I am not able to formalize, but if it is something similar to being Lindelöf, maybe it would be of use here. The question was conceived by myself, so I have no idea how difficult it is or whether the answer is decidable in ZFC. *I would also be interested in answers to these two questions (if $\omega^{\omega_1}$ is normal and if it is Lindelöf), but I don't know if I should ask them all at once.","Does there exist an uncountable subspace $F \subseteq \omega^{\omega_1}$ which is closed and discrete?

Background Motivated by this answer , I have been trying to find an answer to the question that I have asked here . This post is an attempt to answer the question. For the definition of the spaces with which I have dealt see this page . Note that even though I write the conditions of being a $T_i$-space symbollicaly, don't take the expressions to be a formula of some formal language. Just read them as ""convenient abbreviation"" of the intended English language sentence. Definition. Let $(X,\tau)$ be a topological space. Then for each $A\subseteq X$ we define, $$\mathcal{N}_A:=\{U:A\subseteq U\land U\in \tau\}$$and $$\mathcal{C}_A:=\{V:A\subseteq V\land X\setminus V\in\tau\land (\exists U\in\mathcal{N}_A)(A\subseteq U\subseteq V)\}$$If $A=\{x\}$ then instead of $\mathcal{N}_{\{x\}}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{\{x\}}$ we will simply write $\mathcal{N}_{x}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{x}$. $T_0$-Space Theorem 1. A topological space $(X,\tau)$ is $T_0$ iff $$\forall x\forall y((\{x\}\not\subseteq \{y\}\land \{y\}\not\subseteq \{x\})\iff(\mathcal{N}_x\not\subseteq\mathcal{N}_y\lor \mathcal{N}_y\not\subseteq\mathcal{N}_x))$$ Proof. Let $x\ne y$ and let $X$ be $T_0$. Then since $X$ is $T_0$, by the definition of a $T_0$-space, either there exists open set $U\in \mathcal{N}_x$ such that $y\not\in U$ or there exists an open set $V\in \mathcal{N}_y$ such that $x\not\in V$. In the first case (since the condition $y\not\in U$ is equivalent to saying that $U\not\in\mathcal{N}_y$) we conclude that there exists $U\in \mathcal{N}_x$ such that $U\not\in \mathcal{N}_y$. Hence $\mathcal{N}_x\ne\mathcal{N}_y$, implying that $\mathcal{N}_x\ne\mathcal{N}_y\lor \mathcal{N}_y\ne\mathcal{N}_x$. The second case can be dealt similarly. The proof of the converse is trivial and hence skipped. $T_1$-Space Theorem 2. A topological space $(X,\tau)$ is $T_1$ iff $$\forall x\forall y((\{x\}\not\subseteq \{y\}\land \{y\}\not\subseteq \{x\})\iff(\mathcal{N}_x\not\subseteq\mathcal{N}_y\land \mathcal{N}_y\not\subseteq\mathcal{N}_x))$$ Proof. Let $x\ne y$ and let $X$ be $T_1$. Then since $X$ is $T_1$ by the definition of a $T_1$-space, there exists open set $U\in \mathcal{N}_x$ such that $y\not\in U$ and there exists an open set $V\in \mathcal{N}_y$ such that $x\not\in V$. Just like the proof of the previous theorem, we are then forced to conclude that there exists $U\in \mathcal{N}_x$ such that $U\not\in \mathcal{N}_y$ and there exists an open set $V\in \mathcal{N}_y$ such that $V\not\in \mathcal{N}_x$. Consequently $\mathcal{N}_x\not \subseteq \mathcal{N}_y\land \mathcal{N}_y\not\subseteq\mathcal{N}_x$. The proof of the converse is trivial and hence skipped. $T_2$-Space Theorem 3. A topological space $(X,\tau)$ is $T_2$ iff $$\forall x\forall y((\{x\}\not\subseteq \{y\}\land \{y\}\not\subseteq \{x\})\iff(\mathcal{C}_x\not\subseteq\mathcal{C}_y\land \mathcal{C}_y\not\subseteq\mathcal{C}_x))$$ Proof. Suppose $x,y\in X$ such that $x\ne y$ and $X$ is $T_2$. Since $X$ is $T_2$, there exists open sets $U, V$ such that, $x\in U$ $y\in V$ $U\subseteq X\setminus V$ The last condition implies that $\overline{U}\subseteq X\setminus V$. But observe that $\overline{U}\not\in \mathcal{C}_y$ (because $y\not\in X\setminus V$) but $\overline{U}\in \mathcal{C}_x$. Consequently it follows that $\mathcal{C}_x\not\subseteq \mathcal{C}_y$. In a similar manner we will be able to prove that $\mathcal{C}_y\not\subseteq \mathcal{C}_x$ and this would imply in turn that $\mathcal{C}_x\not\subseteq\mathcal{C}_y\land \mathcal{C}_y\not\subseteq\mathcal{C}_x$ and we are done. The proof of the converse is trivial and hence skipped. $T_3$-Space Theorem 4. A topological space $(X,\tau)$ is $T_3$ iff (here $A$ denotes a closed set) $$\forall x\forall A((\{x\}\not\subseteq A\land A\not\subseteq \{x\})\iff(\mathcal{C}_x\not\subseteq\mathcal{C}_A\land \mathcal{C}_A\not\subseteq\mathcal{C}_x))$$ Proof. Suppose $x\in X$ and $A\subseteq X$ such that $x\not\in A$ and $X$ is $T_3$. Since $X$ is $T_3$, there exists open sets $U, V$ such that, $x\in U$ $A\subseteq V$ $U\subseteq X\setminus V$ The last condition implies that $\overline{U}\subseteq X\setminus V$. But observe that $\overline{U}\not\in \mathcal{C}_A$ (because $A\not\subseteq X\setminus V$) but $\overline{U}\in \mathcal{C}_x$. Consequently it follows that $\mathcal{C}_x\not\subseteq \mathcal{C}_A$. To show that $\mathcal{C}_A\not\subseteq\mathcal{C}_x$ observe that $\overline{V}\subseteq X\setminus U$. But observe that $\overline{V}\not\in \mathcal{C}_x$ (because $x\not\in X\setminus U$) but $\overline{V}\in \mathcal{C}_A$. Consequently it follows that $\mathcal{C}_A\not\subseteq \mathcal{C}_x$.

Suppose $A,B\subseteq X$ such that $A\cap B=\emptyset$ and $X$ is $T_4$. Since $X$ is $T_4$, there exists open sets $U, V$ such that, $B\subseteq U$ $A\subseteq V$ $U\subseteq X\setminus V$ The last condition implies that $\overline{U}\subseteq X\setminus V$. But observe that $\overline{U}\not\in \mathcal{C}_A$ (because $A\not\subseteq X\setminus V$) but $\overline{U}\in \mathcal{C}_B$. Consequently it follows that $\mathcal{C}_B\not\subseteq \mathcal{C}_A$. To show that $\mathcal{C}_A\not\subseteq\mathcal{C}_B$ observe that $\overline{V}\subseteq X\setminus U$. But observe that $\overline{V}\not\in \mathcal{C}_B$ (because $B\not\subseteq X\setminus U$) but $\overline{V}\in \mathcal{C}_A$.

This implies in turn that $\mathcal{C}_B\not\subseteq\mathcal{C}_A\land \mathcal{C}_A\not\subseteq\mathcal{C}_B$ and we are done. To prove the converse without loss of generality let us assume that $B\subseteq A$. Then observe that if $B\subseteq A$ and $V\in \mathcal{C}_A$ then as $A\subseteq V$ and $B\subseteq A$ so $B\subseteq V$ and hence it follows immediately that $V\in \mathcal{C}_B$.

Suppose $A,B\subseteq X$ and $X$ is $T_5$. Since $X$ is $T_5$, we have, $B\subseteq X\setminus\overline{A}$ $A\subseteq X\setminus\overline{B}$ Now observe that $X\setminus \overline{A}\in \mathcal{N}_B$ and $X\setminus \overline{B}\in \mathcal{N}_A$. However, $X\setminus \overline{A}\not\in \mathcal{N}_A$ because $A\not\subseteq X\setminus \overline{A}$ (unless $A=\emptyset$, which clearly is not the case always. Consequently it follows that $\mathcal{N}_B\not\subseteq \mathcal{N}_A$. Similarly, one can prove that $\mathcal{N}_A\not\subseteq \mathcal{N}_B$ To prove the converse without loss of generality let us assume that $B\subseteq A$.

Is it possible to formulate equivalent conditions for other spaces mentioned here that I haven't covered only in terms of $\mathcal{N}$'s and $\mathcal{C}$'s?","Disclaimer This question has been once edited to incorporate the suggestion of the answers given below but that post too contained gaps and so I have decided to rollback the post to its second version. Background Motivated by this answer , I have been trying to find an answer to the question that I have asked here . This post is an attempt to answer the question. For the definition of the spaces with which I have dealt see this page . Note that even though I write the conditions of being a $T_i$-space symbollicaly, don't take the expressions to be a formula of some formal language. Just read them as ""convenient abbreviation"" of the intended English language sentence. Definition. Let $(X,\tau)$ be a topological space. Then for each $A\subseteq X$ we define, $$\mathcal{N}_A:=\{U:A\subseteq U\land U\in \tau\}$$and $$\mathcal{C}_A:=\{V:A\subseteq V\land X\setminus V\in\tau\land (\exists U\in\mathcal{N}_A)(A\subseteq U\subseteq V)\}$$If $A=\{x\}$ then instead of $\mathcal{N}_{\{x\}}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{\{x\}}$ we will simply write $\mathcal{N}_{x}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{x}$. $T_0$-Space Theorem 1. A topological space $(X,\tau)$ is $T_0$ iff $$\forall x\forall y((\{x\}\not\subseteq \{y\}\land \{y\}\not\subseteq \{x\})\iff(\mathcal{N}_x\not\subseteq\mathcal{N}_y\lor \mathcal{N}_y\not\subseteq\mathcal{N}_x))$$ Proof. Let $x\ne y$ and let $X$ be $T_0$. Then since $X$ is $T_0$, by the definition of a $T_0$-space, either there exists open set $U\in \mathcal{N}_x$ such that $y\not\in U$ or there exists an open set $V\in \mathcal{N}_y$ such that $x\not\in V$. In the first case (since the condition $y\not\in U$ is equivalent to saying that $U\not\in\mathcal{N}_y$) we conclude that there exists $U\in \mathcal{N}_x$ such that $U\not\in \mathcal{N}_y$. Hence $\mathcal{N}_x\ne\mathcal{N}_y$, implying that $\mathcal{N}_x\ne\mathcal{N}_y\lor \mathcal{N}_y\ne\mathcal{N}_x$. The second case can be dealt similarly. The proof of the converse is trivial and hence skipped. $T_1$-Space Theorem 2. A topological space $(X,\tau)$ is $T_1$ iff $$\forall x\forall y((\{x\}\not\subseteq \{y\}\land \{y\}\not\subseteq \{x\})\iff(\mathcal{N}_x\not\subseteq\mathcal{N}_y\land \mathcal{N}_y\not\subseteq\mathcal{N}_x))$$ Proof. Let $x\ne y$ and let $X$ be $T_1$. Then since $X$ is $T_1$ by the definition of a $T_1$-space, there exists open set $U\in \mathcal{N}_x$ such that $y\not\in U$ and there exists an open set $V\in \mathcal{N}_y$ such that $x\not\in V$. Just like the proof of the previous theorem, we are then forced to conclude that there exists $U\in \mathcal{N}_x$ such that $U\not\in \mathcal{N}_y$ and there exists an open set $V\in \mathcal{N}_y$ such that $V\not\in \mathcal{N}_x$. Consequently $\mathcal{N}_x\not \subseteq \mathcal{N}_y\land \mathcal{N}_y\not\subseteq\mathcal{N}_x$. The proof of the converse is trivial and hence skipped. $T_2$-Space Theorem 3. A topological space $(X,\tau)$ is $T_2$ iff $$\forall x\forall y((\{x\}\not\subseteq \{y\}\land \{y\}\not\subseteq \{x\})\iff(\mathcal{C}_x\not\subseteq\mathcal{C}_y\land \mathcal{C}_y\not\subseteq\mathcal{C}_x))$$ Proof. Suppose $x,y\in X$ such that $x\ne y$ and $X$ is $T_2$. Since $X$ is $T_2$, there exists open sets $U, V$ such that, $x\in U$ $y\in V$ $U\subseteq X\setminus V$ The last condition implies that $\overline{U}\subseteq X\setminus V$. But observe that $\overline{U}\not\in \mathcal{C}_y$ (because $y\not\in X\setminus V$) but $\overline{U}\in \mathcal{C}_x$. Consequently it follows that $\mathcal{C}_x\not\subseteq \mathcal{C}_y$. In a similar manner we will be able to prove that $\mathcal{C}_y\not\subseteq \mathcal{C}_x$ and this would imply in turn that $\mathcal{C}_x\not\subseteq\mathcal{C}_y\land \mathcal{C}_y\not\subseteq\mathcal{C}_x$ and we are done. The proof of the converse is trivial and hence skipped. $T_3$-Space Theorem 4. A topological space $(X,\tau)$ is $T_3$ iff (here $A$ denotes a closed set) $$\forall x\forall A((\{x\}\not\subseteq A\land A\not\subseteq \{x\})\iff(\mathcal{C}_x\not\subseteq\mathcal{C}_A\land \mathcal{C}_A\not\subseteq\mathcal{C}_x))$$ Proof. Suppose $x\in X$ and $A\subseteq X$ such that $x\not\in A$ and $X$ is $T_3$. Since $X$ is $T_3$, there exists open sets $U, V$ such that, $x\in U$ $A\subseteq V$ $U\subseteq X\setminus V$ The last condition implies that $\overline{U}\subseteq X\setminus V$. But observe that $\overline{U}\not\in \mathcal{C}_A$ (because $A\not\subseteq X\setminus V$) but $\overline{U}\in \mathcal{C}_x$. Consequently it follows that $\mathcal{C}_x\not\subseteq \mathcal{C}_A$. To show that $\mathcal{C}_A\not\subseteq\mathcal{C}_x$ observe that $\overline{V}\subseteq X\setminus U$. But observe that $\overline{V}\not\in \mathcal{C}_x$ (because $x\not\in X\setminus U$) but $\overline{V}\in \mathcal{C}_A$. Consequently it follows that $\mathcal{C}_A\not\subseteq \mathcal{C}_x$. This implies in turn that $\mathcal{C}_x\not\subseteq\mathcal{C}_A\land \mathcal{C}_A\not\subseteq\mathcal{C}_x$ and we are done. To prove the converse observe that if $z\in A\cap B$ and $V\in \mathcal{C}_A$ then as $A\subseteq V$ and $x\in A$ so $x\in V$ and hence it follows immediately that $V\in \mathcal{C}_x$. Consequently it follows that $\mathcal{C}_A\subseteq \mathcal{C}_x$ and we are done. $T_4$-Space Theorem 5.

Consequently it follows that $\mathcal{C}_B\not\subseteq \mathcal{C}_A$. To show that $\mathcal{C}_A\not\subseteq\mathcal{C}_B$ observe that $\overline{V}\subseteq X\setminus U$. But observe that $\overline{V}\not\in \mathcal{C}_B$ (because $B\not\subseteq X\setminus U$) but $\overline{V}\in \mathcal{C}_A$.

71,What is the topology on a vector space generated by a family of seminorms?,What is the topology on a vector space generated by a family of seminorms?,,"I have a question about topological vector spaces. I'm getting so confused about what we mean by saying a topology generated by a family of seminorms. At first, I thought it just means the initial topology generated by the family of seminorm functions. But then, I read about this sample, Example 2 . Let X be a set, then $\mathbb{C}^X = \{ f: X \to \mathbb{C} \}$ is a complex vector space. To each $x \in X$, consider $\| \cdot \|_x : \mathbb{C}^X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, ${\| f \|}_x = | f(x) |$. This is a seminorm on $\mathbb{C}^X$. The topology generated by this set of seminorms as $x$ varies over $X$ is the product topology on $\mathbb{C}$. Why is this the same topology as the product topology on $\mathbb{C}^X$?

At first, I thought it just means the initial topology generated by the family of seminorm functions. But then, I read about this sample, Example 2 . Let X be a set, then $\mathbb{C}^X = \{ f: X \to \mathbb{C} \}$ is a complex vector space. To each $x \in X$, consider $\| \cdot \|_x : \mathbb{C}^X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, ${\| f \|}_x = | f(x) |$.

But as $v$ is in $U_i$ and $U_i \cap S_i = \emptyset$ for each $i$, so $v$ cannot be in $S_i$ for any $i$. Thus $v$ cannot be in $A$, which implies that $v \in X-A$, showing that the open set $U \cap U_1 \cap \cdots \cap U_n \subset X-A$. And $x \in U \cap U_1 \cap \cdots \cap U_n$ also.

Then $V$ is a neighborhood of $x$ and if $v \in V$, then $v \in U$ so that $v \in A_{\alpha_i}$ only for some $i = 1, \ldots, n$ and $v \in U_i$ so that $v \not\in S_i$ for any $i = 1, \ldots, n$. Also then $v \not\in A_\alpha$ for any $\alpha \neq \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n$. Is my reasoning so far correct? How to show from here  that $v \not\in A$? P.S.: My Attempt at Part (c) Contd.: Now if this $v$ were to lie in $A$, then $v$ would have to lie in some set $\left( f | A_\alpha \right)^{-1}(B)$ for some $\alpha$. But as each set $\left( f | A_\alpha \right)^{-1}(B)$ is contained in $A_\alpha$ and as $v$ cannot be in any set $A_\alpha$ for any $\alpha$ different from one of the $\alpha_i$, so we can conclude that if $v$ were to lie in $A$, then $v$ would have to be in one of the sets $\left( f | A_{\alpha_i} \right)^{-1}(B) = S_i$ for some $i = 1, \ldots, n$. But as $v$ is in $U_i$ and $U_i \cap S_i = \emptyset$ for each $i$, so $v$ cannot be in $S_i$ for any $i$. Thus $v$ cannot be in $A$, which implies that $v \in X-A$, showing that the open set $U \cap U_1 \cap \cdots \cap U_n \subset X-A$. And $x \in U \cap U_1 \cap \cdots \cap U_n$ also. Thus every point $x \in X-A$ has a neighborhood disjoint from $A$, which implies that set $X-A$ is open and hence $A$ is closed, as required. Is my proof correct now? Or, is there any problem in it?",,['general-topology']
