Suppose the total cost of any route passing through each town exactly once and ending at its starting point doesn't depend on which route is chosen. Prove there exist numbers $a_1,\cdots, a_n, b_1,\cdots, b_n$ so that for all $1\leq i, j \leq n, x_{ij}=a_i + b_j$ . Let $f(a,b)=x_{a1}+x_{1b}-x_{ab}$ where $a,b,1$ are distinct. I think $f(a,b)$ is independent of $a$ and $b$ but I'm not sure how to show this. I know $f(a,b)=f(b,c)$ when $a,b,c,1$ are all distinct, and this can be shown by assuming WLOG that $a<b<c$ and considering the two routes $a,b,1,c,2,\cdots, a-1,a+1,\cdots, b-1,b+1,\cdots, c-1,c+1,\cdots, n,a$ and $a,1,b,c,2\cdots, a-1,a+1\cdots, b-1,b+1,\cdots, c-1,c+1,\cdots, n,a.$ The difference between their costs is $x_{ab}+x_{b1}+x_{1c}-x_{a1}-x_{1b}-x_{bc},$ which must be zero by the problem assumption, and rearranging yields $f(a,b) = f(b,c)$ . But is it true that $f(a,b)=f(b,a)$ for $a,b,1$ distinct (*), and if so how would one show this? I tried a similar approach to above, but I didn't make much progress. Provided (*) holds, we have for $a,b,c,d,1$ all distinct that $f(a,b)=f(b,c)=f(c,d) = f(d,c), f(a,b)=f(b,a)=f(a,c)=f(c,a), f(a,b)=f(b,c)=f(c,b),$ which proves the desired independence. Provided $f(a,b)$ is independent of $a$ and $b$ , for any $1\lt i < j \leq n$ , we have $x_{ij} = x_{i1} + x_{ij} - x_{i1} + x_{1j}-x_{1j} = -f(i,j) + x_{i1} + x_{1j}$ . So letting $F$ denote the constant value of $f(i,j)$ , we can let $a_i = -F + x_{i1}$ and $b_i = x_{1i}$ for $i>1$ and $a_1 = 0, b_1 = F$ .","In a country with towns the cost of travel from the -th town to the -th town is .

So I'm asking for help hopping to get a true final combinatorial (or even probabilistic) interpretation  of this coefficients (so I can stop searching for esoteric papers and maybe focus on my other subjects). Anyway sadly although $\frac{1}{1-e^{x+1}}$ is related to $Seq(Set^*(z+1))$ a very natural looking construction from Flajolet and Sedgewick's classic book, this has problems. In fact it's a very exact variation of the surjection generating function $$\frac{1}{2-e^z}$$ first the surjection evaded the set with no elements (it was $Seq(Seq(Z)-1)$ ). My expression on the other hand even has an extra empty element $Z+1$ entering the set construction, or $Seq(Set(Z+\varepsilon)$ . I have also imagined maybe an $e$ ""cost"" factor (rewriting $\frac{1}{1-e^{x+1}} = \frac{1}{1-e*e^{x}}$ ) but with the problem of having the empty ""urn"" going this way doesn't seem promising enough. For a maybe less contrived approach this seems to be related to seemingly niche problem called Simon Newcomb's problem : A counting problem about compositions with $k$ falls, in generic multisets. The expression that pertains me the most is $$\sum_{d=0}^{\infty} \frac{A_{d}(t) x^{d}}{(1-t)^{d+1} d !}=\frac{1}{1-t e^{x}}$$ where replacing $t$ follows the patterns I see in wolfram-alpha for the two functions in the title, and going with $t=1$ gives an identity in wikipedia, but as both expressions don't seem to have any justification,  it's just a formula for now.

Different ways to count it,K_5,"So, my cousin asked me to count the number of triangles in a picture. The picture was the complete graph on $5$ vertices, known as $K_5$ in graph theory. Here's a ""picture"" of $K_5$: A partial answer has been given here on MSE in this question which can be wrong depending on the interpretation of what a ""node"" is. In our interpretation of the problem, the intersection of two edges forms a new node. So, the points of intersection inside the pentagon lying on the edges of the inner star are considered nodes on their own and therefore, the formula given in that answer is indeed an undercount for our problem. I reasoned like this: Case I - triangles formed by all the three vertices on the pentagon: This is  given by ${5 \choose 3}=10$ Case II - triangles with exactly one vertex on the pentagon: You see that in this case, the only way to form a triangle is to select the two other vertices on the inner star adjacent to our initial vertex on the pentagon. In this case since we have $5$ vertices, we get $5$ different triangles. Case III - triangles with exactly two vertices on the pentagon:  I wish I could draw a picture for this case but I don't know how to do that. Anyway, in this case, we'll have $2$ separate cases: a) The two vertices are adjacent to each other: In this case, we get $3$ non-equivalent triangles. How many ways can we choose two adjacent vertices on the pentagon? $5$ ways. Therefore, we get $15$ triangles. b) The two vertices are not adjacent to each other: In this case, choosing two non-adjacent vertices gives us a triangle each time. For a fixed vertex on the pentagon, we can choose two non-adjacent vertices. Therefore, we get $10$ triangles this time. (This is wrong, please read my edit and the comments under the question.) I would highly appreciate a fancy solution that uses a combination of graph theory and group theory. I believe there should be an answer like that and if you have one, please post it with explanations. EDIT: As noted by zar, it seems that I have overcounted the number of triangles in case III b by a factor of two because after I choose a diagonal of the pentagon, I get a unique triangle. Of course, If I instead focus on the vertices on the pentagon, two vertices joined by a diagonal of the pentagon give rise to the same triangle in case III b and that's why I have overcounted by a factor of $2$.

Let $x$ , $y$ , $z$ and $w$ be four vertices of $G$ . For any two vertices $s$ and $t$ of $G$ , let $d \left(s, t\right)$ denote the minimum length of a path from $s$ to $t$ . Then, the two largest ones among the three numbers $d \left(x, y\right) + d \left(z, w\right)$ , $d \left(x, z\right) + d \left(y, w\right)$ and $d \left(x, w\right) + d \left(y, z\right)$ are equal. This is a known fact, sometimes called the ""four-point condition"" (or at least it is similar to the latter; IIRC the latter is about leaves in phylogenetic trees, where $d$ is no longer the minimum length of a path but the minimum cost in some metric, and I'm not fully sure if there are any clear-cut implications between these results). I am wondering if there is a proof of Theorem 1 along the following lines: For any two vertices $s$ and $t$ of $G$ , define some univariate polynomial $Q_{s, t} \in K\left[X\right]$ (for some field $K$ , possibly $\mathbb{F}_2$ ) having the property that $Q_{s, t}$ is monic with leading term $X^{d\left(s, t\right)}$ (or $X^{d\left(s, t\right) + c}$ for some constant $c$ ). Prove the identity $Q_{x, y} Q_{z, w} \pm Q_{x, z} Q_{y, w} \pm Q_{x, w} Q_{y, z} = 0$ for some choice of $\pm$ signs. Conclude that the largest one among the three numbers $d \left(x, y\right) + d \left(z, w\right)$ , $d \left(x, z\right) + d \left(y, w\right)$ and $d \left(x, w\right) + d \left(y, z\right)$ must be equal to another of these three numbers, since otherwise the leading term in the preceding identity could not cancel. Therefore, Theorem 1. This kind of proof seems to be foreshadowed by the well-known tinfoil (not sure whether it has ever been made rigorous) that ""the space of phyologenetic trees is the tropical Grassmannian"" and, in particular, Theorem 1 is a sort of ""tropical version"" of the Ptolemy theorem $XY \cdot ZW \pm XZ \cdot YW \pm XW \cdot YZ = 0$ for four points $X, Y, Z, W$ lying on a circle (or line).

Let be a tree. Let , , and be four vertices of . For any two vertices and of , let denote the minimum length of a path from to . Then, the two largest ones among the three numbers , and are equal. This is a known fact, sometimes called the ""four-point condition"" (or at least it is similar to the latter; IIRC the latter is about leaves in phylogenetic trees, where is no longer the minimum length of a path but the minimum cost in some metric, and I'm not fully sure if there are any clear-cut implications between these results). I am wondering if there is a proof of Theorem 1 along the following lines: For any two vertices and of , define some univariate polynomial (for some field , possibly ) having the property that is monic with leading term (or for some constant ). Prove the identity for some choice of signs. Conclude that the largest one among the three numbers , and must be equal to another of these three numbers, since otherwise the leading term in the preceding identity could not cancel. Therefore, Theorem 1. This kind of proof seems to be foreshadowed by the well-known tinfoil (not sure whether it has ever been made rigorous) that ""the space of phyologenetic trees is the tropical Grassmannian"" and, in particular, Theorem 1 is a sort of ""tropical version"" of the Ptolemy theorem for four points lying on a circle (or line).

29,Number of ways of coloring projected faces of any hypercube,Number of ways of coloring projected faces of any hypercube,,"EDIT: This is the concrete problem in its current state: How many ways are there of separating a figure consisting of $l$ layers of squares with connected vertices (as the one seen in Fig. 5, for which $l=4$) into faces, when one can only create faces between any four vertices along the edges? An attempt is shown in Fig. 6 for $l=3$. Original question: If we look at the 2D projection of the outline of a cube Fig 1. we can choose to see it as a normal person, Fig. 2 or we can choose to view it in a slightly more perverted way (so that the edge between green and orange faces is closest to the viewer): Fig. 3 Note that the number of different ways of seeing the cube corresponds to the number of different ways of completely covering (without overlap) the area of the projection by rectangular faces with four different vertices as corners. For an $n$-cube ($n \geq 2$), let us call this number $C_n$. As we have seen, $C_3=2$ and obviously $C_2=1$. What is the general expression for $C_n$? At first, when investigating the $4$-cube, I simply drew the projection of one seen at an angle and started constructing the combination tree (blue indicates that a branching choice was made to color that face - the ones in the same figure as the blue face are the ones that were determined as soon as the one in blue was chosen): Fig. 4 However, this was unsystematic and confusing, so I instead realized (hopefully this is true!)$^\dagger$ that I might as well represent it (and indeed any hypercube, by adding more layers) like this: Fig. 5 Let the edges of a square (as it is seen in Fig. 5) be one layer. There is then $1$ layer for a $2$-cube, $2$ for a $3$-cube, $4$ for a $4$-cube, and in general (since there are $2^n$ vertices in an $n$-cube and $4$ vertices in one layer) $2^{n-2}$ layers for an $n$-cube. The idea is now to find out how many new possibilities each layer introduces. Here are the possibilities for two and three layers (I've excluded the ones not unique under rotation and two adjacent faces with the same color is viewed as one face): Fig. 6 This is where I'm stuck: I'm having a hard time seeing the pattern in that there are two ways of having a total of two ""split"" faces in the three-layer case (fifth and sixth three-layer structure in Fig. 6), but only one way of having one, three or four split faces. And even if I knew how to deal with this, the task still seems daunting. Any help is much appreciated! $^\dagger$ There may be introduced some extra symmetries when drawing the cube as the ""inner"" cube in Fig. 4, so that the same object will have less possibilities that are unique under rotation, than when seen as in Fig. 6. This is an unfortunate choice in drawing style, but I believe that this discrepancy in possibilities (only one unique possibility of coloring the ""inner"" cube in Fig. 4) can be avoided if we draw the inner cube in Fig. 4 in two- or three-point perspective instead, so that ""the front"" surface is bigger than the ""back"" (or, which makes it count as two possibilities again, the other way around). If that is not the case, however, it will surely be impossible to order all possible scenarios under continuous rotation of any hypercube so as to be able to account for this effect, so let's focus our attention on the problem as it is given from Fig. 6, and not worry about how to interpret the final result.

34,Five girls and eleven boys are to be lined up in a row such that... Where is my mistake?,Five girls and eleven boys are to be lined up in a row such that... Where is my mistake?,,"Five girls and eleven boys are to be lined up in a row such that from   left to right, the girls are in the order $g_1g_2g_3g_4g_5$. In how   many ways can this be done if $g_1$ and $g_2$ are to be separated by   atleast 3 boys, and there is at most one boy between $g_4$ and $g_5$. First take a look at this which shows the number of ways to put $r$ distinct objects into $n$ distinct boxes such that order matters: If you are too lazy to read it, it basically says that the number of ways to put $r$ distinct objects into $n$ distinct boxes such that the order in the boxes matters is given by $P^{n+r-1}_{r}$ The whole idea is to count the arrangements where there is an arbitrary number of boys between $g_1$ and $g_2$ and atmost one between $g_4$ and $g_5$ and then subract the number of arrangements where there are less than $3$ boys between $g_1$ and $g_2$ (atmost one between $g_4$ and $g_5$). First count the arrangements where there is an arbitrary number of boys between $g_1$ and $g_2$ and atmost one between $g_4$ and $g_5$. If you arrange the girls as $\_g_1\_g_2\_g_3\_g_4g_5\_$, then the dashes can be treated as boxes where to put the boys. Observe that there is no dash between $g_4$ and $g_5$. Case 1: there is no object between $g_4$ and $g_5$. There are $P^{15}_{5}$ such arrangements. Case 2: There is one object between $g_4$ and $g_5$. There are $11\times P^{14}_{5}$ such arrangements. Thus, the total is $3003000$. Now, count the number of permutations where there are less than $3$ boys between $g_1$ and $g_2$. Case 1: $0$ objects between them.

First take a look at this which shows the number of ways to put $r$ distinct objects into $n$ distinct boxes such that order matters: If you are too lazy to read it, it basically says that the number of ways to put $r$ distinct objects into $n$ distinct boxes such that the order in the boxes matters is given by $P^{n+r-1}_{r}$ The whole idea is to count the arrangements where there is an arbitrary number of boys between $g_1$ and $g_2$ and atmost one between $g_4$ and $g_5$ and then subract the number of arrangements where there are less than $3$ boys between $g_1$ and $g_2$ (atmost one between $g_4$ and $g_5$). First count the arrangements where there is an arbitrary number of boys between $g_1$ and $g_2$ and atmost one between $g_4$ and $g_5$.

However, Wikipedia defines the Secretary problem as the task to choose the best candidate, if you see them one at a time and cannot keep anybody on hold. Curiously (at least for me), the best algorithm has the identical chance to find the best candidate, that is $1/e$. Is it really a casual correlation - after all, $e$ pops out everywhere - or derangements are somewhat involved?

The next part though gives me more troubles as I am unsure of how to put the constraint on - that each brother-sister pair has to have 3 gifts.

It's easy to come up with examples that are the image of a magic square. But not every one is. Two examples where this may fail are: $m=n=2$ $A= \left( \begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1  \end{array} \right)$ and $m=n=3$ $A=  \left( \begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 2 & 0 \\ 1 & 2 & 0 \\ 1 & 2 & 0 \end{array} \right) $ Adding the identity to A in this case gives another counterexample of a slightly less trivial nature. However, for $m=2$, $n=3$, every magic square over $\mathbb{Z}_2$ is the preimage of a magic square over $\mathbb{Z}$. This is extremely easy to see, since there are 5 ones and 4 zeros, so the matrix must be the image of the Lo Shu Square (up to permuting rows and columns).There are no magic squares with $m=3, n=2$. There are doable larger cases, but none of the ones I tried gave anything that seemed generic. In general, what I would expect is that for m large compared to n, there won't be any additional ones; this is obvious if $m \ge n^3$ (better bounds are certainly possible). But for m small and n large, there might be more magic squares. And of course, if $m|n$ then cases like the 3x3 above will probably crop up. The question I'm more interested in than the sort of general results above, though, is for a particular magic square over $\mathbb{Z}_m$, what is a fast way to check if it is the image of a magic square over $\mathbb{Z}$ (if such a way exists at all).","A magic square over $\mathbb{Z}$ is an n x n matrix whose entries are $\{1, \ldots, n^2\}$, with the sum of every row and column identical (in particular, my magic squares are all normal, but the sum of diagonal entries need not equal the sum of the rows/columns, which is necessarily $\frac{n(n^2+1)}{2}$).

A Latin square is an $n \times n$ matrix with symbols from $[n]:=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ such that each row and each column contains every symbol. Let $L=(l_{ij})$ be a Latin square.

71,A combinatorial model for multi-sexual reproduction,A combinatorial model for multi-sexual reproduction,,"I was thinking about the following question: why do most creatures on earth reproduce asexually or bisexually, but not trisexually? Looking on the internet, I read an interesting perspective https://www.zhihu.com/question/303528094 that attempts to answer this question via the following mathematical model, which I call the reproduction model . A species has $m$ sexes, and $n$ different types of sexual chromosome, which we call $\{1,2,\cdots, n\}$ . Each individual of the species has a genotype of $m$ sexual chromosomes, which can be described as an $m$ -element multiset with each element in $\{1,2,\cdots, n\}$ . There are disjoint families $F_1, F_2, \cdots, F_m$ of genotypes, such that an individual exhibit sex $i$ iff their sexual chromosome lies in family $F_i$ . There is a distribution $\mu$ on $F_1 \sqcup \cdots \sqcup F_m$ that describes the distribution of each possible genotype across the entire species. We require equal number of individual of each sex : we must have $\mu(F_1) = \mu(F_2) = \cdots = \mu(F_m) = 1/m$ . The main point of the argument is that the distribution $\mu$ must be stable . Specifically, consider the following reproduction process: for each $i$ , we sample a random individual from sex $i$ according to $\mu$ . We then form an offspring by selecting a uniformly random chromosome from each individual. Then the genotype of this offspring must also be distributed according to $\mu$ . Let me give two stable examples. Asexual reproduction: $m = n = 1$ , and $F_1 = \{(1)\}$ . This is clearly stable. Bisexual reproduction: $m = 2, n = 2$ , $F_1 = \{(1, 1)\}$ , $F_2 = \{(1, 2)\}$ , and $\mu$ is uniform. This is also stable, since during reproduction there is an equal chance that an offspring of type $(1,1)$ or $(1,2)$ are born. The author of this models argue that trisexual reproduction is not stable, by considering the following model: $m = 3, n = 2$ , $F_1 = \{(1,1,1)\}, F_2 = \{(1,1,2)\}, F_3 = \{(1,2,2)\}$ , $\mu$ is uniform. Then the probability that the offspring is of sex $1,2,3$ is $2/9,5/9,2/9$ respectively. For example, the offspring is of sex $1$ only if all three parents donate type $1$ chromosome, which happens w.p. $1 \cdot 2/3 \cdot 1/3 = 2/9$ . So this model is unstable. However, the author said that they cannot rule out models with more than $2$ chromosome types i.e. $n \geq 3$ .

Then, an equivalent number-theoretic phrasing of Frankl's conjecture is the following $$\bbox[#FFB797,2pt,border: 2px solid red]{\array{\text{If $\{1\}\neq M\leq\mathbb{N}^*$ is finite and contains only square-free numbers, then}\\ \exists p\in \mathbb{P}:|M\cap \dot p|\geq \frac{1}{2}|M|}}$$ The equivalence can be proven constructing from $M$ the union-closed family $\mathcal{F}_M:=\{\{p\in\mathbb{P}:p\ \vert\ m\}:m\in M\}$ of the universe set $\mathbb{P}$ and constructing from a finite union-closed set $\mathcal{F}$ of the universe set $\mathbb{P}$ the set of square-free numbers $M_\mathcal{F}:=\{\prod_{p\in X}p:X\in \mathcal{F}\}$ . With this new formulation, I thought of generalizing it so that we no longer need the square-free condition. These are the two possible generalizations that I've come up with. If $\emptyset\neq M\leq\mathbb{N}^*$ is finite , then $$\array{\textbf{Conjecture 1. }\ \exists p\in \mathbb{P}:|M\cap \dot p|\geq \cfrac{\nu_p(M)}{1+\nu_p(M)}|M|}\\ \textbf{Conjecture 2. }\ \exists p\in \mathbb{P}:\sum_{m\in M}\nu_p(m)\geq \frac{1}{2}\nu_p(M)|M|$$ where $\nu_p(m)$ is the $p$ -adic valuation of $m$ and I denote $\nu_p(M)=\nu_p(\max M)=\max\limits_{m\in M}\nu_p(m)$ . Note as well that, now, we don't need to exclude the case $M=\{1\}$ anymore as $\nu_p(\{1\})=0$ . I expect that at least one of them has a counterexample. However, I am quite sloppy at finding them. So then my quesion is Q: Do the previous generalizations have clear counterexamples? I will now explain the motivation to why I chose those precise coefficients on the right hand side of both conjectural inequalities to show that they aren't arbitrary. Note that on the original Frankl conjecture, we find that for the finite power set $2^U$ the inequality $$|\{X\in 2^U:\alpha\in X\}|\geq 2^{|U|-1}=\frac{1}{2}|2^U|$$ is, in fact, an equality for every $\alpha\in U$ . So, in a sense, one expects that the maximal case is as bad as it gets. Now, it isn't hard to see that the equivalent lcm-closed set to the union-closed set $2^{\{p_1,...,p_k\}}$ where $\{p_1,...,p_k\}$ are distinct primes is the set $\text{Div}(P)$ of divisors of $P=\prod_{j=1}^k p_j$ where $P$ is a square-free number. So, if we consider any $M=\text{Div}(m_0)$ for some $m_0\in\mathbb{N}^*$ (not necessarily square-free), one easily sees that $$\Rightarrow |M\cap\dot p|=d(m_0)- d(m_0p^{-\nu_p(m_0)})=(1+\nu_p(m_0))d(m_0p^{-\nu_p(m_0)})-d(m_0p^{-\nu_p(m_0)})$$ $$=\nu_p(m_0) d(m_0p^{-\nu_p(m_0)})=\frac{\nu_p(m_0)}{1+\nu_p(m_0)}d(m_0)= \cfrac{\nu_p(M)}{1+\nu_p(M)}|M|$$ $$\Rightarrow \sum_{m\in M}\nu_p(m)=\sum_{d\vert m_0}\nu_p(d)=\sum_{j=0}^{\nu_p(m_0)}\sum_{d\vert m_0\\ \nu_p(d)=j}\nu_p(d)=\sum_{j=0}^{\nu_p(m_0)}\sum_{d\vert m_0\\ \nu_p(d)=j}j=\left(\sum_{j=0}^{\nu_p(m_0)}j\right)d(m_0p^{-\nu_p(m_0)})$$ $$\frac{1}{2}\nu_p(m_0)(1+\nu_p(m_0))d(m_0p^{-\nu_p(m_0)})=\frac{1}{2}\nu_p(m_0)d(m_0)=\frac{1}{2}\nu_p(M)|M|$$ So, if these are as bad as it gets, the previous conjectures follow. This also means that both inequalities (if true) are also sharp. Note as well that both conjectures can be rephrased as generalization of Frankl's conjecture with multisets (or, equivalently, tuples of natural numbers) avoiding number-theoretic terminology. Specifically, if $\emptyset\neq E\subseteq \mathbb{N}^n$ is a finite max-closed set, i.e. $(x_j),(y_j)\in E\Rightarrow (\max\{x_j,y_j\})\in E$ , then one can rephrase the previous conjectures as $$\array{\textbf{Conjecture 1. }\ \exists j\in n:|\{x\in E: x_j = 0\}|\leq \frac{1}{1+\max\limits_{x\in E} x_j}|E|}\\ \textbf{Conjecture 2. }\ \exists j\in n:\sum_{x\in E}x_j\geq \frac{1}{2}\left(\max\limits_{x\in E} x_j\right)|E|$$","Denote and write to denote that is lcm-closed, i.e. .

Consider a union-closed family $\mathcal{F} = \{A_1, \dotsc ,A_n\}$ of $n$ finite sets, $n$ odd, $n \ge 3$ , $A_i \neq \emptyset$ , $i=1,\dotsc,n$ . Let $r=\frac{n+1}{2}$ . We have that: $$\bigcup_{1 \le i_1 \lt \ldots \lt i_r  \le n} A_{i_1} \cap \ldots \cap A_{i_r } = \bigcap_{1 \le i_1 \lt \ldots \lt i_r \le n} A_{i_1} \cup \ldots \cup A_{i_r} \tag{1}\label{1}$$ This is because the LHS contains all elements that are in at least $r$ of the $A_i$ and the RHS contains all elements that are in at least $n-r+1$ of the $A_i$ (because for each element that does not belong to the RHS we can find $r$ $A_i$ that do not contain it and thus it is in maximum $n-r$ of the $A_i$ ) and note that in our case $r=n-r+1$ . The RHS is the intersection of $\binom{n}{\frac{n+1}{2}}$ union expressions. However, we can simplify it removing all terms equal to $U(\mathcal{F})$ or which are supersets of another term, keeping only one union expression for each possible resulting set, to get: $$\bigcap_{1 \le i_1 \lt \ldots \lt i_r \le n} A_{i_1} \cup \ldots \cup A_{i_r} = \bigcap_{k=1}^{h} A_{i_{k,1}} \cup \dotsb \cup A_{i_{k,r}} = \bigcap_{k=1}^{h} B_k \tag{2}\label{2}$$ Where $h \le n-1$ and $B_k = A_{i_{k,1}} \cup \dotsb \cup A_{i_{k,r}}$ . After that, if there is no set $A_{i_{k,1}},\ldots,A_{i_{k,r}}$ in the expression equal to $B_k$ , we replace one set with it, otherwise we leave the expression like it is. In any case we can rewrite it as: $$B_k = A_{j_{k,1}} \cup \dotsb \cup A_{j_{k,r-1}} \cup B_k \tag{3}\label{3}$$ Now suppose that there is some $B_t = A_{j_{u,v}}$ with $t \not= u$ . That would imply $B_t \subseteq B_u$ and then $\eqref{2}$ not minimal. Therefore $B_t \not= A_{j_{u,v}}$ and for what said before also $B_t \not= A_{j_{t,z}}$ . This means that $A_{i_{k,1}},\ldots,A_{i_{k,r-1}}$ are chosen among $n-h-1$ sets ( $-h$ is to remove the $B_k$ and $-1$ for $U(\mathcal{F})$ ). Now suppose that $\bigcap_{k=1}^{h} B_k = \emptyset$ . Suppose also that there is one $A_l$ appearing in $h-1$ of the $\eqref{3}$ expressions, WLOG in $B_1, \ldots ,B_{h-1}$ . Then $A_l \cap A_{i_{h,m}} = \emptyset$ , $m=1,\ldots,r-1$ and $A_l \cap B_h = \emptyset$ , therefore it is easy to see that the unions $A_l \cup A_{i_{h,m}}$ , $m=1,\ldots,r-1$ and $A_l \cup B_h$ must be all different and different also from $A_l$ , $A_{i_{h,m}}, m=1,\ldots,r-1$ , and $B_h$ . We would then have a total of $1 \times r+1+r=n+2 \gt n$ sets, absurd. Therefore all $A_l$ must appear in maximum $h-2$ of the $\eqref{3}$ expressions. As said above $A_{i_{k,1}},\ldots,A_{i_{k,r-1}}$ are $r-1=\frac{n-1}{2}$ sets chosen among $n-h-1$ sets, with $1 \le k \le h$ . None of those sets can appear in more than $h-2$ union expressions. Therefore, thinking to a matrix where each column represents the same set and each row one of the union expressions, we can say that if $\bigcap_{k=1}^{h} B_k = \emptyset$ then: $$h(n-h-1) \ge \frac{n-1}{2}h + 2(n-1-h) \label{4}\tag{4}$$ Inequality $\eqref{4}$ has no solution for $n$ odd, $n \lt 25$ . It implies also that $h \le \frac{n-1}{2}$ . I am curious to see how looks a union-closed family such that all $A_l$ appear in maximum $h-2$ of the $\eqref{3}$ expressions, but I wasn't able to find an example. Someone can help? I precise that in the example that I search it shouldn't be possible to replace some $B_k$ with a different expression, in a way that there is a set appearing $h-1$ or $h$ times. A possible idea is starting from this example where $h=4$ but there is no set appearing in all the $4$ expressions, but there are sets appearing in $h-1=3$ expressions.

Consider a union-closed family of finite sets, odd, , , . Let . We have that: This is because the LHS contains all elements that are in at least of the and the RHS contains all elements that are in at least of the (because for each element that does not belong to the RHS we can find that do not contain it and thus it is in maximum of the ) and note that in our case . The RHS is the intersection of union expressions. However, we can simplify it removing all terms equal to or which are supersets of another term, keeping only one union expression for each possible resulting set, to get: Where and . After that, if there is no set in the expression equal to , we replace one set with it, otherwise we leave the expression like it is. In any case we can rewrite it as: Now suppose that there is some with . That would imply and then not minimal. Therefore and for what said before also .

78,When are the partition numbers squares?,When are the partition numbers squares?,,"I'm unsure if this question is even interesting. I am playing around with partition numbers $p(n) :=$ # partitions of $n$ , and I noticed that $p(n)$ never really is a square number, except for of course $n = 0, 1$ . Is there a simple reason for this? It also seems to be similar for other modified partition numbers, such as $p_{t}(n) :=$ #t-regular partitions of $n$ (none of its parts are divisible by $t$ ), at least for $t = 2, 3, 4$ and a few more. In these cases the only square $p_{t}(n)$ are when $p_{t}(n) \in \{0,1\}$ . For example, $p_{11}(n)$ is square (apparently) only when $0 \leq n \leq 6$ , in which case $p_{11}(n) \in \{0, 1\}$ . It gets a little weirder when we consider $p_{s, t}(n) :=$ #s-regular and t-distinct partitions of $n$ (no part appears $t$ or more times).

90,Creating a Skyrim Alchemy metric: combining the binomial theorem and birthday paradox,Creating a Skyrim Alchemy metric: combining the binomial theorem and birthday paradox,,"I am trying to create a metric to sort alchemy ingredients by in Skyrim,  I wanted to sort the ingredients by ""probability of yielding a potion with the number of ingredients I have"". The way I was looking at the problem is that it is a combination of the Birthday paradox and a binomial trial, but I'm having trouble mixing the two concepts, because 1) it's hard 2) I never took a proper stat class. I'm a physicist by training, and my stat education was all based on error propagation and curve fitting. If you haven't played Skyrim, these are the rules (R) for the alchemy mini-game: Skyrim has ingredients which are combined into potions. Each ingredient has 4 effects, which must be ""discovered."" You can attempt to make a potion with 2 or 3 ingredients. If any of the effects in the combination are the same, a potion will be created with those matched effects. A potion can be created whether the effects were known or unknown before the combination. When you combine 2 ingredients, whose effects were unknown before the combination, and those ingredients both have the same effect, the effect will be discovered for both ingredients. The game keeps track of failed combinations of ingredients. If you select ingredient I, ingredients I' that produced a failed experiment will be greyed out. It is currently unknown if this is ""pullable data"", but it is immediately obvious when playing the alchemy mini-game. A Skyrim alchemy tutorial, with relevant part starting at 8:28 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E3PkxusHDc&t=508s The end product would hopefully be a mod that would sort the alchemy ingredients by the metric. It would either be a modification to, or require the mod called SkyUI. See: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12604?tab=posts Assumptions (A) for modelling the problem Total number of effects is known and fixed (56, e.g. Ravage Health, Fortify Barter, Restore Magika) Potions are created using 3 ingredients When searching for the effects ingredient I, ingredients I' and I'' will be chosen so that no common effects are known. i.e. Skyrim reports ""A potion of unknown effect."" For a given ingredient, all 4 effects are different. See: https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Ingredients_(Skyrim) No two ingredients have all 4 of the same effects. The number of ingredients can change based on DLC's and mods to the game, but is approximately 80-200. The game's ""sell value"" of an ingredient is a good proxy for its rarity. Not that important at this stage, but if I am to implement this into a mod for Skyrim, I have these functions to work with (I can create more, or make lookup tables): https://www.creationkit.com/index.php?title=Math_Script For any other imposed assumptions or approximations, an error or uncertainty of <=1% is negligible, and up to 10% is acceptable. E.g. an approximation of a binomial coefficient, swapping a binomial distribution for a gaussian, hack to decrease calculation time. Conjectures (C) (statements that are probably true enough to model the problem with) If you are trying to determine unknown effect(s) of ingredient I, it doesn't matter if the effects of I' or I'' are known or not. Effects are randomly and uniformly distributed amongst ingredients, given conditions A4, A5. Not true, but close enough, see https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Ingredients_(Skyrim) . A3 implies that each experiment is testing the unknown effects of ingredient I, amongst 8 unique effects in ingredients I' and I''. This isn't completely true, since if you make a combination of 3 ingredients where I' and I'' have at least 1 unknown effect, it is possible that you could discover a matched effect between I' and I'', but not discover an effect in I. Hypotheses (H) A given experiment/combination/trial, can be modelled as a birthday paradox. With a given unknown effect checking for matches amongst 8 effects in ingredients I' and I''. With the number of people in the room being subbed for number of effects (8? 9? 10? 11? 12?), and days of the year being subbed for the total number of effects (56) Repeated trials can be modelled with the binomial distribution. The probability of a match from the birthday trial gets plugged into the probability of success in the binomial distribution. Questions (Q) for the Internet Are hypotheses 1-3 correct? How do I model the birthday problem? It's like 4 people go into a room of 8, none of the 4 entering people have the same birthdate, and the people in the room could have 5-8 unique birthdays selected from 56 days. For the binomial model, I need ""at least 1 success"", how do I model that? Is it using the (binomial?) distribution equation, or the formula for the definite integral of the distribution? Is the chance of a creating a potion based more on the first ingredient, or the 2nd and 3rd ingredients? What are some resources that would help me solve this problem? Assume that I have access to the internet, LibreOffice, scihub, torrent sites, but not a library or a college math department. I theoretically have access to Mathematica, but it would take 1-8 hours to set up on my Raspberry Pi 3B (I tried yesterday, and I think I FUBARed the OS, hopefully not the Pi or SanDisk). Equations (E) I would actually like to obtain/solve using my mod/code/equations. For the following, Let: I be the ingredient under test, k = number of known effects of ingredient I, T=total number of effects in Skyrim (56), q=quantity of ingredient I (practical range 0-10000), n=number of ingredients in inventory (minimum 3, no theoretical max, practical range 40-100). Given 3 Ingredients, where none of the effects are known, what is the probability that a potion will be created in 1 trial. Given an ingredient I, with k of 4 known effects, what is the probability of of creating a potion with ingredients I' and I'', assuming Skyrim says ""A potion of unknown effect"" What is the probability of discovering effect I_e (e is a subscript from 1-4), amongst all ingredients, within n trials, where n is the quantity of ingredient I in inventory. What is the expected gold wasted (game value of ingredients) before effect I_e is discovered, performing the search required for Equation 3.","I am trying to create a metric to sort alchemy ingredients by in Skyrim,  I wanted to sort the ingredients by ""probability of yielding a potion with the number of ingredients I have"". The way I was looking at the problem is that it is a combination of the Birthday paradox and a binomial trial, but I'm having trouble mixing the two concepts, because 1) it's hard 2) I never took a proper stat class. I'm a physicist by training, and my stat education was all based on error propagation and curve fitting. If you haven't played Skyrim, these are the rules (R) for the alchemy mini-game: Skyrim has ingredients which are combined into potions. Each ingredient has 4 effects, which must be ""discovered."" You can attempt to make a potion with 2 or 3 ingredients. If any of the effects in the combination are the same, a potion will be created with those matched effects. A potion can be created whether the effects were known or unknown before the combination. When you combine 2 ingredients, whose effects were unknown before the combination, and those ingredients both have the same effect, the effect will be discovered for both ingredients. The game keeps track of failed combinations of ingredients. If you select ingredient I, ingredients I' that produced a failed experiment will be greyed out. It is currently unknown if this is ""pullable data"", but it is immediately obvious when playing the alchemy mini-game. A Skyrim alchemy tutorial, with relevant part starting at 8:28 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E3PkxusHDc&t=508s The end product would hopefully be a mod that would sort the alchemy ingredients by the metric. It would either be a modification to, or require the mod called SkyUI. See: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12604?tab=posts Assumptions (A) for modelling the problem Total number of effects is known and fixed (56, e.g. Ravage Health, Fortify Barter, Restore Magika) Potions are created using 3 ingredients When searching for the effects ingredient I, ingredients I' and I'' will be chosen so that no common effects are known. i.e. Skyrim reports ""A potion of unknown effect."" For a given ingredient, all 4 effects are different. See: https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Ingredients_(Skyrim) No two ingredients have all 4 of the same effects. The number of ingredients can change based on DLC's and mods to the game, but is approximately 80-200. The game's ""sell value"" of an ingredient is a good proxy for its rarity. Not that important at this stage, but if I am to implement this into a mod for Skyrim, I have these functions to work with (I can create more, or make lookup tables): https://www.creationkit.com/index.php?title=Math_Script For any other imposed assumptions or approximations, an error or uncertainty of <=1% is negligible, and up to 10% is acceptable. E.g. an approximation of a binomial coefficient, swapping a binomial distribution for a gaussian, hack to decrease calculation time. Conjectures (C) (statements that are probably true enough to model the problem with) If you are trying to determine unknown effect(s) of ingredient I, it doesn't matter if the effects of I' or I'' are known or not. Effects are randomly and uniformly distributed amongst ingredients, given conditions A4, A5. Not true, but close enough, see https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Ingredients_(Skyrim) . A3 implies that each experiment is testing the unknown effects of ingredient I, amongst 8 unique effects in ingredients I' and I''. This isn't completely true, since if you make a combination of 3 ingredients where I' and I'' have at least 1 unknown effect, it is possible that you could discover a matched effect between I' and I'', but not discover an effect in I. Hypotheses (H) A given experiment/combination/trial, can be modelled as a birthday paradox. With a given unknown effect checking for matches amongst 8 effects in ingredients I' and I''. With the number of people in the room being subbed for number of effects (8? 9? 10? 11? 12?), and days of the year being subbed for the total number of effects (56) Repeated trials can be modelled with the binomial distribution. The probability of a match from the birthday trial gets plugged into the probability of success in the binomial distribution. Questions (Q) for the Internet Are hypotheses 1-3 correct? How do I model the birthday problem? It's like 4 people go into a room of 8, none of the 4 entering people have the same birthdate, and the people in the room could have 5-8 unique birthdays selected from 56 days. For the binomial model, I need ""at least 1 success"", how do I model that? Is it using the (binomial?) distribution equation, or the formula for the definite integral of the distribution? Is the chance of a creating a potion based more on the first ingredient, or the 2nd and 3rd ingredients? What are some resources that would help me solve this problem? Assume that I have access to the internet, LibreOffice, scihub, torrent sites, but not a library or a college math department. I theoretically have access to Mathematica, but it would take 1-8 hours to set up on my Raspberry Pi 3B (I tried yesterday, and I think I FUBARed the OS, hopefully not the Pi or SanDisk). Equations (E) I would actually like to obtain/solve using my mod/code/equations. For the following, Let: I be the ingredient under test, k = number of known effects of ingredient I, T=total number of effects in Skyrim (56), q=quantity of ingredient I (practical range 0-10000), n=number of ingredients in inventory (minimum 3, no theoretical max, practical range 40-100). Given 3 Ingredients, where none of the effects are known, what is the probability that a potion will be created in 1 trial. Given an ingredient I, with k of 4 known effects, what is the probability of of creating a potion with ingredients I' and I'', assuming Skyrim says ""A potion of unknown effect"" What is the probability of discovering effect I_e (e is a subscript from 1-4), amongst all ingredients, within n trials, where n is the quantity of ingredient I in inventory.

The conjugate of elements in $\mathbb{F}$ is defined by $\overline{x}=x^q$ . I need to find the number of $n\times n$ unitary circulant matrices over $\mathbb{F}$ . The number of invertible circulant matrices over a finite field can be seen elsewhere, such as when $n,q$ coprime and my question when $n=\operatorname{char} q$ . Is there any better method to calculate this number other than considering each entry? Added on 30 May 2020: Let $C$ be the subgroup of $\operatorname{GL}_n(q^2)$ of all circulant matrices. Is $C\operatorname{GU}_n(q)$ a subgroup of $\operatorname{GL}_n(q^2)$ ? That is, is $C\operatorname{GU}_n(q)=\operatorname{GU}_n(q)C$ ?
