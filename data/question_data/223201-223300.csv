9,Divisor exact sequence in the etale topology?,Divisor exact sequence in the etale topology?,,"In Milne's book Lectures on étale cohomlogy ( link ), there is the following proposition. Proposition 13.4 . Let X be a connected regular scheme with generic point $\eta$ .

I'm having trouble understanding what this sequence is, and why it is exact. I am perfectly happy with this exact sequence in the Zariski topology, but I don't understand its construction in the étale topology. The first map is an adjunction; that is fine. To construct the second map, we want to define it on an étale neighborhood $\pi : U \to X$ , so what we want a map $$\Gamma(\pi^{-1}(\eta), \mathbb{G}_m) \to \bigoplus_{Z} \Gamma(\pi^{-1}(Z), \mathbb{Z}_Z).$$ Now the left hand side is just the multiplicative group of invertible rational functions on $U$ , and the right hand side is, well, a $\mathbb{Z}^{\pi_0(\pi^{-1} Z)}$ for each Weil divisor $Z$ . Given a rational function on $U$ , I suspect this map will be something like ""evaluating"" its order of zero/pole at a connected component of $\pi^{-1} Z$ . Because $U$ is regular (being étale over a regular scheme), it looks well-defined. But the issue I run into is that $\pi^{-1} Z$ can have connected components that have multiple irreducible components. For a concrete example, I could take $X = \mathbb{A}^2$ , $Z$ a nodal curve in $X$ , and create $U$ so that $\pi^{-1} Z$ is finite étale over $Z$ has two irreducible components that are normalizations of $Z$ . We could try and define the order as the sum of the orders of the irreducible components of $\pi^{-1} Z$ . But even if we do that, the kernel has more things that what we want. We can have rational functions that have a pole of order $1$ on one irreducible component of $\pi^{-1} Z$ and a zero of order $1$ on the other component, so that they cancel out. This is definitely in the kernel, but not in $\Gamma(U, \mathbb{G}_m)$ . So the question is, is there something wrong with my reasoning? What is the correct definition of the maps, and why is the sequence exact? On the other hand, the book seems to use this sequence only in the case when $X$ is a curve over an algebraically closed field. In that case, the above issue doesn't arise.

Here is the problem Let $K$ be a perfect field, $V/K$ be an affine variety, and let $G_K = \operatorname{Gal}(\overline{K}/K)$ . Prove that $K[V] = \{f\in\overline{K}[V]:f^\sigma=f\;\;\forall\sigma\in G_K\}$ . Here is the hint: the $\subset$ direction is clear. Conversely, if $F\in\overline{K}[X]$ is a representative of $f$ , the map $G_K\to\mathcal{I}(V)$ via $\sigma\mapsto F^\sigma-F$ is a 1-cocycle (indeed, if $f^\sigma=f$ in $\overline{K}[V]$ , then $F^\sigma-F\in\mathcal{I}(V)$ and $F^{\sigma\tau}-F = (F^{\sigma}-F)^\tau+ (F^\tau-F)$ ). It's the next point that I do not understand. Using $H^1(G_K,\overline{K}^+) = 0$ , I'm supposed to deduce that there is some $G\in\mathcal{I}(V)$ such that $F+G\in K[X]$ . I see that this would solve the problem, since in that case $f = (F+G)+\mathcal{I}(V)\in K[V]$ . Here's what I don't understand. Since $H^1(G_K,\overline{K}^+) = \frac{Z^1(G_K,\overline{K}^+)}{B^1(G_K,\overline{K}^+)}$ , so if $H^1 = 0$ , this means $Z^1(G_K,\overline{K}^+) = B^1(G_K,\overline{K}^+)$ , so the function $\sigma\mapsto F^\sigma-F$ out to come from a boundary.

I'll use $ F: V \to W $ to denote a morphism of affine algebraic varieties, and $ F^* : \mathbb{C}[W] \to \mathbb{C}[V] $ the pullback of $F$ on the coordinate rings.

If $ y \in U \cap F(V)$ , then there exists $ x \in V $ so that $y = F(x)$ , and $ g(y) \neq 0$ . Thus $(gF)(x) \neq 0$ , a contradiction. Now assume $F(V)$ is not dense, i.e. there exists some nonempty open set $U \subseteq W$ so that $U\cap F(V) = \emptyset$ . So there exists some family of polynomials $p_i$ with $i \in I$ so that $U = \{y \in W : p_i(y) \neq 0, i \in I\}$ . Hence $U \cap F(V) = \emptyset$ implies that $(p_i F)(x) = 0$ for all $ i \in I$ and $x \in V$ , which by the injectivity of $F$ means $p_i = 0$ , i.e. $U = \emptyset$ , a contradiction.

34,Maximal ideal and not algebraically closed field,Maximal ideal and not algebraically closed field,,"This is a question concerning maximal ideals in a polynomial ring over a non-algebraically closed field k. First is the example inspired for this question: as a standard exercise, it is easy to show that $\langle x^2+1\rangle$ is a maximal ideal in $\mathbb{R}[x]$ (Briefly speaking, let $J$ be an ideal s.t. $I\subset J$ and take $f\in J\setminus I$ , divide $f$ by $x^2+1$ to obtain $f(x)=q(x)(x^2+1)+(ax+b)$ , then one can show that $a^2+b^2\in J$ (see here , for example), so $J=\mathbb{R}[x]$ ) Next, consider the ideal $\langle x_1^2+1, x_2,\cdots ,x_n\rangle \subseteq \mathbb{R}[x_1,\cdots ,x_n]$ . This is a maximal ideal (use the exact same argument above) Now, we can generalize things. If $k$ is non-algebraically closed field, we should be able to construct a maximal ideal in $k[x_1,\cdots ,x_n]$ using the logic above. Namely, pick $f\in k[x_1]$ s.t. it has no root in $k$ , then consider the ideal $\langle f,x_2,\cdots ,x_n\rangle$ . Our inspiration tells us that this ideal should be maximal. However, I have a hard time proving it. As before, let $J$ be an ideal s.t. $I\subset J$ and take $g\in J\setminus I$ . Using the multivariable division algorithm to divide $g$ by $(f,x_1,\cdots ,x_n)$ , we obtain $g=q_1f+q_2x_2+\cdots +q_nx_n+r$ with $r\in k[x_1]$ . A simple observation shows that $r\in J$ .

61,"Definition of a Sheaf, making sense of","Definition of a Sheaf, making sense of",,"I have started to read an english translation of Serre's FAC. Immediately a sheaf is defined. The more categorical definition given on wikipedia actually makes more sense to me, but I would like to understand this one as it is written since I will be working through this paper. I give the definition, then pose some questions. Definition: Let $X$ be a topological space. A sheaf of abelian groups on $X$ (or   simply a sheaf ) consists of: (a) A function $x \to \mathscr{F}_x$, giving for all $x \in X$ an   abelian group $\mathscr{F}_x$, (b) A topology on the set $\mathscr{F}$, the sum of the sets   $\mathscr{F}_x$. If $f$ is an element of $\mathscr{F}_x$, we put $\pi(f) = x$; we call   the mapping of $\pi$ the projection of $\mathscr{F}$ onto $X$; the   family in $\mathscr{F} \times \mathscr{F}$ consisting of pairs   $(f,g)$ such that $\pi(f) = \pi(g)$ is denoted by   $\mathscr{F}+\mathscr{F}$. Having stated the above definitions, we impose two axioms on the data   (a) and (b): (I) For all $f \in \mathscr{F}$ there exist open neighborhoods $V$ of   $f$ and $U$ of $\pi(f)$ such that the restriction of $\pi$ to $V$ is   a homeomorphism of $V$ and $U$.(In other words,  is a local   homeomorphism). (II) The mapping $f \mapsto -f$ is a continuous mapping from   $\mathscr{F}$ to $\mathscr{F}$, and the mapping $(f, g) \mapsto f + g$   is a continuous mapping from $\mathscr{F}+\mathscr{F}$ to   $\mathscr{F}$. Questions: 1) At the very beginning of this definition, what are we taking   $\mathscr{F}$ to be? It seems we are referring to it indirectly as the   category of abelian groups. In this definition is $\mathscr{F}$ just   some unspecified class of abelian groups? They refer to $\mathscr{F}$ as a set in (b), but I don't believe the category of abelian groups is small. What should I be taking $\mathscr{F}$ as? 2) After this definition, which thing(s) exactly is (are) the sheaf?   Is it the pair $(f,\tau)$ where $f$ is the function from (a) and   $\tau$ the topology from (b)?

Immediately a sheaf is defined. The more categorical definition given on wikipedia actually makes more sense to me, but I would like to understand this one as it is written since I will be working through this paper. I give the definition, then pose some questions. Definition: Let $X$ be a topological space. A sheaf of abelian groups on $X$ (or   simply a sheaf ) consists of: (a) A function $x \to \mathscr{F}_x$, giving for all $x \in X$ an   abelian group $\mathscr{F}_x$, (b) A topology on the set $\mathscr{F}$, the sum of the sets   $\mathscr{F}_x$. If $f$ is an element of $\mathscr{F}_x$, we put $\pi(f) = x$; we call   the mapping of $\pi$ the projection of $\mathscr{F}$ onto $X$; the   family in $\mathscr{F} \times \mathscr{F}$ consisting of pairs   $(f,g)$ such that $\pi(f) = \pi(g)$ is denoted by   $\mathscr{F}+\mathscr{F}$. Having stated the above definitions, we impose two axioms on the data   (a) and (b): (I) For all $f \in \mathscr{F}$ there exist open neighborhoods $V$ of   $f$ and $U$ of $\pi(f)$ such that the restriction of $\pi$ to $V$ is   a homeomorphism of $V$ and $U$.(In other words,  is a local   homeomorphism). (II) The mapping $f \mapsto -f$ is a continuous mapping from   $\mathscr{F}$ to $\mathscr{F}$, and the mapping $(f, g) \mapsto f + g$   is a continuous mapping from $\mathscr{F}+\mathscr{F}$ to   $\mathscr{F}$. Questions: 1) At the very beginning of this definition, what are we taking   $\mathscr{F}$ to be? It seems we are referring to it indirectly as the   category of abelian groups. In this definition is $\mathscr{F}$ just   some unspecified class of abelian groups? They refer to $\mathscr{F}$ as a set in (b), but I don't believe the category of abelian groups is small. What should I be taking $\mathscr{F}$ as? 2) After this definition, which thing(s) exactly is (are) the sheaf?   Is it the pair $(f,\tau)$ where $f$ is the function from (a) and   $\tau$ the topology from (b)? The function from (a) seems to be   playing the role of the functor from the definition on wikipedia,   except that the functor pairs open sets of $X$ to objects, not points of the   space $X$. 3) In part (b), a priori of the rest of the definition, is it just   stating that any topology can be on $\mathscr{F}$? Why do they say   'the sum of the sets $\mathscr{F}_x$'. 4) In I and II, how am I to make sense of $-f$ and $f+g$ if $f,g$ are   abelian groups? does this have to do with the topology we put on the   collection of sets? 5) Is this definition actually equivalent to the one on wikipedia?

93,Why are proper morphisms restricted to those of finite type?,Why are proper morphisms restricted to those of finite type?,,"Proper morphisms of schemes are defined to be separated, universally closed, and of finite type, for instance see The The Stacks Project - Tag 0CL4 . In section 10.3 of The Rising Sea: Foundations of Algebraic Geometry , starting with the notion of proper maps of topological spaces, Vakil motivates the requirement for being separated and emphasises the role of being universally closed. What about finite type? Is there some important theorem about proper morphisms that does not work without the (locally of) finite type assumption, is it to prevent some counter-intuitive examples, or is it just because it is defined this way in EGA II?","Proper morphisms of schemes are defined to be separated, universally closed, and of finite type, for instance see The The Stacks Project - Tag 0CL4 .

94,Canonical connection on the Frobenius pull-back,Canonical connection on the Frobenius pull-back,,"If $X$ is a scheme over a scheme $S$ of characteristic $p>0$ and $F:X\to X^{(p)}$ is the relative Frobenius, it is known that there is a canonical connection on the Frobenius pull-back $F^*E$ of a vector bundle (or coherent sheaf) on  $X^{(p)}$. This is defined locally via $f\otimes s\mapsto (1\otimes s)\otimes df$ However, I have problems understanding this connection in practical examples. For example if we consider $X=\mathbb{P}^{1}_{k}$ over a field $k$ of characteristic $p>0$, (in which case $X^{(p)}=X=\mathbb{P}^{1}_{k}$) and an invertible sheaf $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^{1}_{k}}(n)$, how does this connection map a given section of $F^*\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^{1}_{k}}(n)$?
