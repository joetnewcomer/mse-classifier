0,Complement of a foliation,Complement of a foliation,,"I have an $n$-manifold $M$ which is foliated by leaves $F_\alpha$ of dimension $p$ and a path $\gamma:[0,1]\to M$. You can take without problems $\gamma$ to be injective. Is the following statement true? Claim: There exists a neighborhood $U$ of the image of $\gamma$ and a foliation $L_\beta$ of $U$ of dimension $n-p$ such that $F_\alpha\pitchfork L_\beta$ for all $\alpha,\beta$. Basically what I would like to do is to have an extension of a complement of the tangent space to the leaves $F_\alpha$ in $TM$ to the tangent of local submanifolds of complementary dimension. I feel that this should be true, but I'm not sure about how to proceed. Would go to local coordinates (respecting the foliation) in charts around $\gamma$ solve the problem? How could I make the obtained complements patch together correctly? An easy partial result: We can always find such a complement to the foliation in an appropriate chart. Indeed, by definition of foliation we know that for any point $m\in M$ we have a neighborhood $U$ of $m$ and a chart $\phi:U\to\mathbb{R}^n$ such that the leaves correspond to the $p$-planes of constant $x$, where we decompose $(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^{n-p}\times\mathbb{R}^p=\mathbb{R}^n$. Then the preimages of the planes of constant $y$ are our complement (they are regular by the inverse function theorem and the usual arguments).","I have an $n$-manifold $M$ which is foliated by leaves $F_\alpha$ of dimension $p$ and a path $\gamma:[0,1]\to M$.

5,What is exponential map in differential geometry,What is exponential map in differential geometry,,"Is $\exp_{q}(v)$ a projection of point $q$ to some point $q'$ along the geodesic whose tangent (right?) at $q$ is the vector $v$ ? And so $\exp_{q}(v)$ is the projection of point $q$ to some point along the geodesic between $q$ and $q'$ ? (Another post gives an explanation: Riemannian geometry: ...Why is it called 'Exponential' map? So now I'm wondering how we know where $q$ exactly falls on the geodesic after it travels for a unit amount of time. Does it uniquely depend on $p, v, M$ only, is it affected by any other parameters as well, or is it arbitrarily set to any point in the geodesic?) The reason that it is called exponential map seems to be that the function satisfy that two images' multiplication $\exp_{q}(v_1)\exp_{q}(v_2)$ equals the image of the two independent variables' addition (to some degree)? But that simply means a exponential map is sort of (inexact) homomorphism. Is there any other reasons for this naming? (To make things clearer, what's said above is about exponential maps of manifolds, and what's said below is mainly about exponential maps of Lie groups. And I somehow 'apply' the theory of exponential maps of Lie group to exponential maps of Riemann manifold (for I thought they were 'consistent' with each other).

It seems $[v_1, v_2]$ 'measures' the difference between $\exp_{q}(v_1)\exp_{q}(v_2)$ and $\exp_{q}(v_1+v_2)$ to the first order, so I guess it plays a role similar to one that first order derivative $/1!$ plays in function's expansion into power series.

13,Complex manifolds and Hermitian metrics,Complex manifolds and Hermitian metrics,,"I've been trying to learn some complex geometry, and was getting confused in thinking about Hermitian metrics.  In this post, I've written up my current understanding, in hopes that someone can look it over and verify/clarify where I have gone right/wrong. $\newcommand{\pp}[1]{\frac{\partial}{\partial #1}}$ I'll start with definitions, to fix notation and for practice. Let $M$ be a complex manifold of dimension $n$, and let us fix a point $p \in M$.  Around $p$ we can find a holomorphic coordinate chart: an open set $U \subset M$ and holomorphic coordinates $z_1, \dots, z_n : M \to \mathbb{C}$.  If $x_j, y_j$ are the real and imaginary parts of $z_j$, then $x_1, y_1, \dots, x_n, y_n : U \to \mathbb{R}$ give us a smooth coordinate chart.  So $M$ is also a differentiable manifold of real dimension $2n$, and thus we can define a tangent space $T_p M$ in the usual way as a real vector space of dimension $2n$; a basis for $T_p M$ is given by $\pp{x_1}, \pp{y_1}, \dots, \pp{x_n}, \pp{y_n}$. Now $T_p M$ carries a natural almost complex structure; namely, the linear map $J$ defined by $J \pp{x_j} = \pp{y_j}$ and $J \pp{y_j} = -\pp{x_j}$.  If the differentiable manifold $M$ carries a Riemannian metric $g$, so that $g_p : T_p M \times T_p M \to \mathbb{R}$ is a bilinear symmetric positive definite form, then we say this metric is Hermitian if it respects the almost complex structure: $g_p(J v, J w) = g_p(v,w)$ (and the same holds for every other point $p$).  So far, so good? We may also consider the complexified tangent space $T_p M \otimes \mathbb{C}$, which is a complex vector space of complex dimension $2n$.  As I understand it, we typically extend $g_p$ to $T_p M \otimes \mathbb{C}$ by bilinearity ; in particular, for $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{C}$, we have $g_p(\alpha v, \beta w) = \alpha \beta g_p(v,w)$.  So $g_p$ is now a bilinear symmetric form on $T_p M \otimes \mathbb{C}$. In particular, $g_p : (T_p M \otimes \mathbb{C})^2 \to \mathbb{C}$ is no longer positive definite: indeed, $$g_p\left(\pp{x_i} - i \pp{y_j}, \pp{x_i} - i \pp{y_j}\right) = 0.$$ This confused me for a while, because the more usual notion of an inner product on a complex vector space is a positive definite sesquilinear symmetric form: i.e., $\langle \alpha v, \beta w \rangle = \alpha \bar{\beta} \langle v,w \rangle$.  Indeed, the word ""Hermitian"" is often used to describe such a form.  So I would naively ask: Why is it better to take $g_p$ to be bilinear on $T_p M \otimes \mathbb{C}$, rather than sesquilinear? If we took the sesquilinear extension instead, would we still get a reasonable theory, or would something bad happen? I think part of the reason I was confused is that $T_p M \otimes \mathbb{C}$, considered as a real vector space of dimension $4n$ (with basis $\left\{ \pp{x_j}, i \pp{x_j}, \pp{y_j}, i \pp{y_j} \right\}$) actually carries two distinct almost complex structures.  First is the obvious one: multiplication by $i$, sending $\pp{x_j}$ to $i \pp{x_j}$ and so on.  The other one is the complex linear extension of $J$, which sends $\pp{x_j}$ to $\pp{y_j}$, sends $i \pp{x_j}$ to $i \pp{y_j}$ and so on.  And the point is that we take our extension of $g_p$ to be Hermitian with respect to the latter, not the former.

23,Why does Brownian motion have drift on Riemannian Manifolds?,Why does Brownian motion have drift on Riemannian Manifolds?,,"Given a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$, the paths of a Brownian motion on it can be written as the following stochastic differential equation in local coordinates: $$ dX_t = \sqrt{g^{-1}} dB_t - \frac{1}{2} g^{ij}\Gamma^k_{ij} dt = \sigma(X_t)\, dB_t + \vec{b}(X_t) \,dt $$ where $B_t$ is an $n$ dimensional Wiener process and $g_{ij}\sigma^i_k\sigma^j_\ell=\delta_{k\ell}$. My question is conceptual and geometric in nature: how can there be a drift term in this equation? Algebraically, I understand, roughly speaking, that it arises from the extra temporal terms in Ito's formula. However, in a general relativity sort of way, one can consider $g$ to be a ""warping of space"" (say for $M=\mathbb{R}^n$), and we note $g$ is always symmetric. The metric does not depend on directions , but only on locations (unlike say for Finsler manifolds). In other words, acceleration in one direction due to the curvature also occurs in the opposite direction, meaning the effect of the curvature on the diffusion is also symmetric.

One can do this at every point. I suppose the drift would not disappear off of $p$, but it still seems odd to me that the presence of drift would not somehow be an invariant. Undoubtedly, I am missing something here. I think something to do with the heat equation generating the SDE above, i.e. $\partial_t u = \Delta_g u/2$, may be useful.

33,The invariance of the Ricci tensor under diffeomorphisms and its non-ellipticity.,The invariance of the Ricci tensor under diffeomorphisms and its non-ellipticity.,,"Consider $(M,g)$ a compact Riemannian manifold. When viewed as a second order (non-linear) differential operator $$ \text{Ric} : C^{\infty}(\text{Sym}^2_+T^*M) \to C^{\infty}(\text{Sym}^2T^*M), $$ the Ricci operator (taking a metric $g$ to its Ricci tensor $\text{Ric}(g)$) is seen to be non-elliptic. I'm reading the discussion about this in Chow and Knopf's The Ricci Flow: An Introduction (this is section 2 in chapter 3), where they claim that this non-ellipticity is due only to the invariance of the Ricci tensor under diffeomorphisms, i.e. $$ \text{Ric}(\varphi^*g) = \varphi^*\text{Ric}(g). $$ I'm trying to understand exactly to what extent is this statement true; is the non-ellipticity of $\text{Ric}$ equivalent to that invariance? Now what they first do is show that from this invariance, you can deduce that the kernel of  the symbol  $$ \sigma(D\text{Ric}_g(\xi)) : \text{Sym}^2T^*M \to \text{Sym}^2T^*M $$ has dimension at least $n = \dim M$ for $\xi \neq 0$. Basically, differentiating this invariance gives a complex $$ 0 \to T^*M \overset{\sigma(\delta_g^*)(\xi)}\longrightarrow \text{Sym}^2T^*M\overset{\sigma(D \text{Ric}_g)(\xi)}\longrightarrow \text{Sym}^2T^*M $$ for $\delta_g^*$ the $L^2$ adjoint of the divergence operator acting on $\text{Sym}^2T^*M$. So if we show that in fact $\ker(\sigma(D\text{Ric}_g))$ has dimension $n$ by showing that $\text{im}(\sigma(D\text{Ric}_g))$ has dimension $\frac12n(n-1)$, we will know that all the non-ellipticity is caused by this invariance. Now conversely, to what extent does the non-ellipticity of $\text{Ric}$ implies its invariance under diffeomorphisms? I feel like Chow and Knopf's discussion is trying to adress this but I'm not completely satisfied with my understanding. What they do is show that the invariance wrt flows associated to vector fields implies the second contracted Bianchi identity $$ \nabla^jR_{ij} = \frac12\nabla_iR $$ which in turn implies an infinitesimal version of the invariance, namely $$ ((D\text{Ric}_g) \circ \delta_g^*)(\alpha) = \frac12\mathcal{L}_{\alpha^{\sharp}}(\text{Ric}_g) $$ for $\alpha$ a 1-form. They claim that this means the contracted second Bianchi identity is equivalent to the invariance of the Ricci tensor under diffeomorphisms but isn't this identity strictly weaker than the Bianchi identity? In any case, they then express the contracted second Bianchi identity as $B_g(\text{Ric}(g)) = 0$ for $$ B_g : C^{\infty}(\text{Sym}^2T^*M) \to C^{\infty}(T^*M) $$ the Bianchi operator given by $B_g(h)_k = g^{ij}(\nabla_ih_{jk} - \frac12\nabla_kh_{ij})$. Then to show that the kernel of $\sigma(D\text{Ric}_g(\xi))$ is actually $n$-dimensional, they continue the sequence of symbols: $$ 0 \to T^*M \overset{\sigma(\delta_g^*)(\xi)}\longrightarrow \text{Sym}^2T^*M \overset{\sigma(D \text{Ric}_g)(\xi)}\longrightarrow \text{Sym}^2T^*M \overset{\sigma(B_g)(\xi)} \longrightarrow T^*M \to 0. $$ The contracted second Bianchi identity reading $B_g \circ \text{Ric}_g = 0$, it implies that $\text{im}(\sigma(D\text{Ric}_g)) \subset \ker(\sigma(B_g))$ and a little analysis of $\sigma(B_g)$ actually shows that this sequence is exact. But this means that $\dim(\text{im}(\sigma(D\text{Ric}))) = \frac12n(n-1)$ as wanted because then $\dim(\ker\sigma(B_g)(\xi)) = \frac12n(n-1)$. Let's call the dimension of $\ker\sigma(D\text{Ric}_g)$ the number of degrees of non-ellipticity of $\text{Ric}_g$. I'd like to read the equivalence from this exact sequence as follows: The exactness at the first $\text{Sym}^2T^*M$ is a consequence of the invariance of $\text{Ric}$ under diffeomorphisms and contributes $n$ degrees of non-ellipticity to $\text{Ric}$. Conversely, if there are exactly $n$ degrees of non-ellipticity, this would imply the exactness at the second $\text{Sym}^2T^*M$ by counting dimensions, which (infinitesimally, at the level of symbols) is the contracted second Bianchi identity, which might imply the invariance under diffeomorphisms of $\text{Ric}$. Is there any way to make this last argument rigorous? I really don't see how I can go from a statement on the symbol of the linearization of an operator to the analogous statement on the actual operator. Any vague ideas would be appreciated! If it helps, I'm reading this to try and really understand the idea behind deTurck's trick of ""killing diffeomorphism invariance to make Ricci flow parabolic"". I'd like to get a proof of the parabolicity of Ricci-deTurck flow without even having to calculate its symbol.","Consider $(M,g)$ a compact Riemannian manifold. When viewed as a second order (non-linear) differential operator $$ \text{Ric} : C^{\infty}(\text{Sym}^2_+T^*M) \to C^{\infty}(\text{Sym}^2T^*M), $$ the Ricci operator (taking a metric $g$ to its Ricci tensor $\text{Ric}(g)$) is seen to be non-elliptic. I'm reading the discussion about this in Chow and Knopf's The Ricci Flow: An Introduction (this is section 2 in chapter 3), where they claim that this non-ellipticity is due only to the invariance of the Ricci tensor under diffeomorphisms, i.e. $$ \text{Ric}(\varphi^*g) = \varphi^*\text{Ric}(g). $$ I'm trying to understand exactly to what extent is this statement true; is the non-ellipticity of $\text{Ric}$ equivalent to that invariance? Now what they first do is show that from this invariance, you can deduce that the kernel of  the symbol  $$ \sigma(D\text{Ric}_g(\xi)) : \text{Sym}^2T^*M \to \text{Sym}^2T^*M $$ has dimension at least $n = \dim M$ for $\xi \neq 0$. Basically, differentiating this invariance gives a complex $$ 0 \to T^*M \overset{\sigma(\delta_g^*)(\xi)}\longrightarrow \text{Sym}^2T^*M\overset{\sigma(D \text{Ric}_g)(\xi)}\longrightarrow \text{Sym}^2T^*M $$ for $\delta_g^*$ the $L^2$ adjoint of the divergence operator acting on $\text{Sym}^2T^*M$. So if we show that in fact $\ker(\sigma(D\text{Ric}_g))$ has dimension $n$ by showing that $\text{im}(\sigma(D\text{Ric}_g))$ has dimension $\frac12n(n-1)$, we will know that all the non-ellipticity is caused by this invariance. Now conversely, to what extent does the non-ellipticity of $\text{Ric}$ implies its invariance under diffeomorphisms? I feel like Chow and Knopf's discussion is trying to adress this but I'm not completely satisfied with my understanding. What they do is show that the invariance wrt flows associated to vector fields implies the second contracted Bianchi identity $$ \nabla^jR_{ij} = \frac12\nabla_iR $$ which in turn implies an infinitesimal version of the invariance, namely $$ ((D\text{Ric}_g) \circ \delta_g^*)(\alpha) = \frac12\mathcal{L}_{\alpha^{\sharp}}(\text{Ric}_g) $$ for $\alpha$ a 1-form. They claim that this means the contracted second Bianchi identity is equivalent to the invariance of the Ricci tensor under diffeomorphisms but isn't this identity strictly weaker than the Bianchi identity? In any case, they then express the contracted second Bianchi identity as $B_g(\text{Ric}(g)) = 0$ for $$ B_g : C^{\infty}(\text{Sym}^2T^*M) \to C^{\infty}(T^*M) $$ the Bianchi operator given by $B_g(h)_k = g^{ij}(\nabla_ih_{jk} - \frac12\nabla_kh_{ij})$. Then to show that the kernel of $\sigma(D\text{Ric}_g(\xi))$ is actually $n$-dimensional, they continue the sequence of symbols: $$ 0 \to T^*M \overset{\sigma(\delta_g^*)(\xi)}\longrightarrow \text{Sym}^2T^*M \overset{\sigma(D \text{Ric}_g)(\xi)}\longrightarrow \text{Sym}^2T^*M \overset{\sigma(B_g)(\xi)} \longrightarrow T^*M \to 0. $$ The contracted second Bianchi identity reading $B_g \circ \text{Ric}_g = 0$, it implies that $\text{im}(\sigma(D\text{Ric}_g)) \subset \ker(\sigma(B_g))$ and a little analysis of $\sigma(B_g)$ actually shows that this sequence is exact. But this means that $\dim(\text{im}(\sigma(D\text{Ric}))) = \frac12n(n-1)$ as wanted because then $\dim(\ker\sigma(B_g)(\xi)) = \frac12n(n-1)$. Let's call the dimension of $\ker\sigma(D\text{Ric}_g)$ the number of degrees of non-ellipticity of $\text{Ric}_g$.

61,Homotopy invariance of de Rham cohomology,Homotopy invariance of de Rham cohomology,,"Let $M,N$ be smooth manifolds which are homotopy equivalent i.e., there exists smooth maps $F:M\rightarrow N$ and $G:N\rightarrow M$ such that $F\circ G$ is homotopic to identity map on $N$ and $G\circ F$ is homotopic to identity map on $M$. Then, Homotopy invariance of deRham cohomology says that the de Rham cohomology groups of $M$ and $N$ are isomorphic. I am not able to understand the construction given in Lee's Intoduction to Smooth manifolds. What is the rough idea behind this proof (or any other proof) of homotopy invariance of de Rham cohomology. EDIT : Given that $M,N$ are homotopy equivalent as above, we need to prove that $H^p_{dR}(M)$ and $H^p_{dR}(N)$ are isomorphic. we expect this to come from $F^*:H^p_{dR}(N)\rightarrow H^p_{dR}(M)$ and $G^*:H^p_{dR}(M)\rightarrow H^p_{dR}(N)$. I do not understand the idea behind proof of two homotopic maps have induce same deRham cohomology maps . Once we prove this, then $F\circ G$ and $1_N$ induce same deRham cohomology maps i.e., the composition $H^p_{dR}(N)\xrightarrow{F^*} H^p_{dR}(M)\xrightarrow{G^*} H^p_{dR}(N)$ is same as the identity map on $H^p_{dR}(N)$ and similarly the composition $H^p_{dR}(M)\xrightarrow{G^*} H^p_{dR}(N)\xrightarrow{F^*} H^p_{dR}(M)$ is same as the identity map on $H^p_{dR}(M)$. This says that $F^*\circ G^*=1$ and $G^*\circ F^*=1$. Thus,  $F^*,G^*$ are isomorphisms, inverses to each other, conlcuding that deRham cohomology groups  $H^p_{dR}(M)$ and $H^p_{dR}(N)$ are isomorphic. How do we prove that two homotopy maps induce same deRham cohomology maps. Let $f:M\rightarrow N$ and $g:M\rightarrow N$ be two homotopy maps, we want to prove that $f^*=g^*:H^p_{dR}(N)\rightarrow H^p_{dR}(M)$ i.e., $f^*(\omega)=g^*(\omega)+\text{closed p-form on }M$ when seen as maps $\Omega^p(N)\rightarrow \Omega^p(M)$. This means, we are expected to have $$f^*(\omega)=g^*(\omega)+d\eta$$ where $\eta$ is a smooth $p-1$ form. This gives question of defining a map $h:\{\text{closed p-forms on }N\}\subseteq \Omega^p(N)\rightarrow \Omega^{p-1}(M)$ assigning to each closed $p$ form $\omega$ on $N$ a $p-1$ form $\eta$ on $M$ such that  $f^*(\omega)=g^*(\omega)+d\eta$. Then author says it turns out to be far simpler to define $h:\Omega^p(N)\rightarrow \Omega^{p-1}(M)$ not with the condition $f^*(\omega)=g^*(\omega)+d(h\omega)$ for every closed form $\omega$ but with a more general condition that $$f^*(\omega)-g^*(\omega)=d(h\omega)+h(d\omega)$$ for every smooth $p$ form. Suppose $\omega$ is closed then $d\omega=0$ and we get the required condition that $f^*(\omega)-g^*(\omega)=d(h\omega)$. So, now the question is to define a map $h:\Omega^p(N)\rightarrow \Omega^{p-1}(M)$ satisfying the condition as above. How can we think of constructing such map? If we are thinking of going from a $p$ form to a $p-1$ form one obvious thing is to some how integrate this $p$ form. What $p$ form can we integrate here?

Then, Homotopy invariance of deRham cohomology says that the de Rham cohomology groups of $M$ and $N$ are isomorphic. I am not able to understand the construction given in Lee's Intoduction to Smooth manifolds. What is the rough idea behind this proof (or any other proof) of homotopy invariance of de Rham cohomology. EDIT : Given that $M,N$ are homotopy equivalent as above, we need to prove that $H^p_{dR}(M)$ and $H^p_{dR}(N)$ are isomorphic. we expect this to come from $F^*:H^p_{dR}(N)\rightarrow H^p_{dR}(M)$ and $G^*:H^p_{dR}(M)\rightarrow H^p_{dR}(N)$. I do not understand the idea behind proof of two homotopic maps have induce same deRham cohomology maps . Once we prove this, then $F\circ G$ and $1_N$ induce same deRham cohomology maps i.e., the composition $H^p_{dR}(N)\xrightarrow{F^*} H^p_{dR}(M)\xrightarrow{G^*} H^p_{dR}(N)$ is same as the identity map on $H^p_{dR}(N)$ and similarly the composition $H^p_{dR}(M)\xrightarrow{G^*} H^p_{dR}(N)\xrightarrow{F^*} H^p_{dR}(M)$ is same as the identity map on $H^p_{dR}(M)$. This says that $F^*\circ G^*=1$ and $G^*\circ F^*=1$. Thus,  $F^*,G^*$ are isomorphisms, inverses to each other, conlcuding that deRham cohomology groups  $H^p_{dR}(M)$ and $H^p_{dR}(N)$ are isomorphic. How do we prove that two homotopy maps induce same deRham cohomology maps. Let $f:M\rightarrow N$ and $g:M\rightarrow N$ be two homotopy maps, we want to prove that $f^*=g^*:H^p_{dR}(N)\rightarrow H^p_{dR}(M)$ i.e., $f^*(\omega)=g^*(\omega)+\text{closed p-form on }M$ when seen as maps $\Omega^p(N)\rightarrow \Omega^p(M)$. This means, we are expected to have $$f^*(\omega)=g^*(\omega)+d\eta$$ where $\eta$ is a smooth $p-1$ form. This gives question of defining a map $h:\{\text{closed p-forms on }N\}\subseteq \Omega^p(N)\rightarrow \Omega^{p-1}(M)$ assigning to each closed $p$ form $\omega$ on $N$ a $p-1$ form $\eta$ on $M$ such that  $f^*(\omega)=g^*(\omega)+d\eta$. Then author says it turns out to be far simpler to define $h:\Omega^p(N)\rightarrow \Omega^{p-1}(M)$ not with the condition $f^*(\omega)=g^*(\omega)+d(h\omega)$ for every closed form $\omega$ but with a more general condition that $$f^*(\omega)-g^*(\omega)=d(h\omega)+h(d\omega)$$ for every smooth $p$ form. Suppose $\omega$ is closed then $d\omega=0$ and we get the required condition that $f^*(\omega)-g^*(\omega)=d(h\omega)$. So, now the question is to define a map $h:\Omega^p(N)\rightarrow \Omega^{p-1}(M)$ satisfying the condition as above. How can we think of constructing such map? If we are thinking of going from a $p$ form to a $p-1$ form one obvious thing is to some how integrate this $p$ form. What $p$ form can we integrate here? It is natural to some how integrate the $p$ form $f^*(\omega)-g^*(\omega)$ to get a $p-1$ form $h\omega$. So, when you reverse the process i.e., when you differentiate you get $f^*(\omega)-g^*(\omega)=d(h\omega)$. This idea is vague and I can not make it any better.

Anyway, I don't know how to do it. Introduction Ehresmann's theorem generalizes the regular value theorem. It states that there is a natural diffeomorphism $$f^{-1}(B_n) \simeq B_n \times f^{-1}(n),$$ where $n$ is a regular value of $f$, $B_n$ is its sufficiently small neighbourhood and $f$ is a smooth proper map between manifolds $f\colon M\to N$ (proper = pre-image of a compact set is compact). We can restrict to the case where $M$ is compact - then $f$ is always proper. We can easily further generalize it to the case where we take the pre-image of (a neighbourhood of) a smooth submanifold $V$ of $N$ instead of a single point $n\in N$, assuming that the normal bundle to it is trivial: by tubular neighbourhood theorem we can find a neighbourhood of $V$ diffeomorphic to $V\times B$ (where $B$ is a ball in the normal bundle), and deduce the claim by applying the theorem to the composition $\pi_{_B} \circ f$, where $\pi_{_B}$ is the projection $V\times B\to B$. I want to ask if this diffeomorphism may be natural in some way and if the theorem can be generalized to nontrivial bundles. Question To formulate the question properly, let's look at normal bundles $\def\N{\mathcal N} \N$. We can see that $$\pi_{\N(V)}\circ f_*:\N(f^{-1}(V))\to \N(V)$$ establishes a fiberwise isomorphism of the bundles (where $\pi_{\N(V)}$ is the orthogonal projection $TN\to \N(V)$) and thus we can think of $\N(f^{-1}(V))$ as a pullback of $\N(V)$.

There is a natural map $p:S^{2n+1}\rightarrow \mathbb{C}P^n$ mapping a point on $S^{2n+1}\subseteq \mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ to the unique complex line it spans in $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$. It is well know that $p$ gives $S^{2n+1}$ the structure of an $S^1$ bundle over $\mathbb{C}P^n$.  From this, one gets a long exact sequence in homotopy groups.

Cohen (found online) in section 2.2, but the author merely says that the result is ""proved in the same way"" as in the real case; but in the real case, $\{\pm 1\}$ acts properly discontinuously on the sphere, and the projection is a local diffeomorphism. This isn't true in the complex case.",,"['differential-geometry', 'vector-bundles', 'projective-space']"
95,geodesics on a surface of revolution,geodesics on a surface of revolution,,"I'm having problems with exercise 1 of chapter 3 of do Carmo's ""Riemannian Geometry"".  Here is the background: Let $(u,v)$ be the coordinates on $\mathbb{R}^2$.  Let $f,g\in C^\infty(\mathbb{R})$, and observe that $\varphi:\mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$ given by $\varphi(u,v)=(f(v)\cos u,f(v)\sin u,g(v))$ is an immersion assuming $f'(v)^2+g'(v)^2\not= 0$ and $f(v)\not= 0$.  The image is the surface of revolution generated by the curve $(f(v),g(v))$ being rotated about the $z$-axis.  The induced metric is $$ (g_{ij})=\left( \begin{array}{cc} f^2 & 0 \\ 0 & f'^2+g'^2 \end{array} \right), $$ and the local equations of a geodesic $\gamma$ are $$ \left\{ \begin{array}{l} \frac{d^2 u}{dt^2} + \frac{2ff'}{f^2}\frac{du}{dt}\frac{dv}{dt}=0 \\ \frac{d^2 v}{dt^2}-\frac{ff'}{f'^2+g'^2}\left( \frac{du}{dt} \right)^2 + \frac{f'f'' + g'g''}{f'^2+g'^2} \left( \frac{dv}{dt} \right)^2 = 0. \end{array} \right. $$ Then, do Carmo says: Obtain the following geometric meaning of the equations above: the second equation is, except for meridians ($u=u_0$) and parallels ($v=v_0$), equivalent to the fact that the ""energy"" $|\gamma'(t)|^2$ of a geodesic is constant along $\gamma$; the first equation signifies that if $\beta(t)$ is the oriented angle, $\beta(t)<\pi$, of $\gamma$ with a parallel $P$ intersecting $\gamma$ at $\gamma(t)$, then $r\cos \beta$ is constant, where $r$ is the radius of $P$. This last paragraph is what's confusing me.  First of all, I've seen the energy of a path as $\int_a^b |\gamma'(t)|^2 dt$, so maybe that's why he put ""energy"" in quotes.  But also, geodesics have constant speed!  So this should be constant along all geodesics too (regardless of whether they're meridians or parallels).  But I figured that maybe I should just blindly plug and chug since that seems to work scarily often in Riemannian geometry, so I found $|\gamma'(t)|^2$, took its $t$-derivative, and substituted in the second equation in the system for geodesics.  Here it is: $$ |\gamma'(t)|^2 = \left\langle \frac{d \gamma}{dt} , \frac{d \gamma}{dt} \right\rangle = u'^2 g_{11} + 2u'v'g_{12} + v'^2 g_{22} = u'^2f^2+v'^2(f'^2+g'^2)$$ so $$ \frac{d}{dt} |\gamma'(t)|^2 = 2u'u''f^2+2u'^2ff' + 2v'v''(f'^2+g'^2)+v'^2(2f'f''+2g'g'') $$ $$ = 2u'u''f^2+2u'^2ff' + 2v'(ff'u'^2-(f'f''+g'g'')v'^2)) + 2v'v''(f'^2+g'^2)+2v'^2(f'f''+g'g'')$$ $$ = 2u'u''f^2+2u'^2ff'(1+v')+2v'v''(f'^2+g'^2)+2v'^2(f'f''+g'g'')(1-v')$$ and this looks hopeless.","I'm having problems with exercise 1 of chapter 3 of do Carmo's ""Riemannian Geometry"".
