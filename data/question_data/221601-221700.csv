2,what are the fppf covers of an algebraically closed field,what are the fppf covers of an algebraically closed field,,"I'm trying to get a feel for Grothendieck topologies by considering some really simple examples (and this relates to a question in Kleiman's chapter on the Picard Scheme in FGA explained).

Concerning the literature, its weak on this point, many books either do not prove the theorem, or only state the theorem with the weaker hypothesis, or give references to original works where the notation leaves one in doubt as what the hypothesis are and whose proofs lack detail and clarity. Now follows a sketch of a proof assuming the derived functor cohomology is zero, $H^q(U_s,\mathcal{F})=0$.  Let $0\rightarrow \mathcal{F}\rightarrow \mathcal{I}^0\rightarrow \ldots$ be an injective resolution of $\mathcal{F}$ and $\check{C}^p(\mathcal{U},\mathcal{I}^q)$ the Godement resolution of $\mathcal{I}^q$. So we have a double complex, (which I dont know how to latex here)  the columns (except the first) are exact since  $\mathcal{I}^q$ is flabby and the homology of the rows gives $\check{C}^p(\mathcal{U},\mathcal{H}^q(\mathcal{F}))$ and since this latter is $\prod_s H^q(U_s, \mathcal{F})=0$ we see that the rows (except the first) are exact and one can now chase to define an isomorphism between the homologies of the first row and first column.

The idea is to show by induction on $q$ that $\check{H}^q(U_s,\mathcal{F})\rightarrow H^q(U_s,\mathcal{F})$ is an isomorphism for all $s$. For if we have this for all $q<n$ the we apply the previous version with $U_s$ instead of $X$ and taking now those intersections of $\mathcal{U}$ contained in $U_s$.

15,Local parameter of curves in affine n-space,Local parameter of curves in affine n-space,,"I'm looking for a double answer to this question: a mathematical one (say, if the statement is correct or not) and a philosophical one (say, why we do expect this to be true, or not). Let $k$ be a field, that we may or may not assume to be algebraically closed. Let $A = k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ be the polynomial ring in $n$-variables and coefficients in $k$. Consider an embedded curve $C$ in $\mathbb{A}^n$, regular at a point $P$ (say, the origin). Let $I = (f_1, \ldots, f_r)$ be the ideal defining the curve. By the Jacobian criterion, we know that not all the derivatives of $f_i$ are $0$ in $P$. Let $\mathcal{O}_{C,P} = A_P/I_P$ be the local ring of $C$ at $P$: it is a discrete valuation ring and we can choose a local parameter $t$ for $C$ at $P$, i.e. a generator for the maximal ideal. We can therefore write down a local parametrization of the curve: $$ x_i=x_i(t)= t^{c_i}g_i(t), c_i\in \mathbb{Z}, v_t(g_i(t))=0 $$ where $v_t$ denotes the valuation. The Jacobian criterion recalled above tells us that, in particular, there is one $x_i$ (say $x_n$) such that $c_i=1$. By passing to the completion $\hat{\mathcal{O}}_{C,P}$ we can absorb the unit term in the local parameter. This gives in particular that we could have chosen directly $x_n\in \mathcal{O}_{C,P}$ as parameter and we could have written down $$x_i =h_i(x_n), h_i(x_n)\in k[[x_n]]$$ Now the question is: is it true that we have a canonical isomorphism $$\hat{\mathcal{O}}_{C,P} \cong k[[x_1, \ldots, x_n]]/(x_i-h_i(x_n))$$ (hopefully one should not complete again on the right)? For $n=2$, one can invoke Hensel's lemma, in the form that reminds the implicit function theorem: let $f(x,y)\in k[[x]][y]$ and suppose $f(0,0)=0$, $\partial f/\partial y(0,0)\neq 0$. Then there exists $g(x)\in k[[x]]$ such that $g(0)=0$ and $f(x, g(x))=0$. If I understand correctly, this statement gives that, after passing to the completion, one has  $$k[[x,y]]/(f(x,y)) \cong k[[x,y]]/(y-g(x))\cong k[[x]]/(g(x)).$$ Side question: we know that the implicit function theorem does not hold in algebraic geometry, in the sense that Zariski topology has too large open sets to expect that an étale map is a local isomorphism. On the other hand, we generally say that ""this is true étale-locally"". So I ask: is the above statement correct after passing to the Henselianization of the ring $\mathcal{O}_{C,P}$?

I know $V_1, V_2$ both have fiberations over $\mathbb{P}^1$, and for any closed point $t \in \mathbb{P}^1$, the fibres ${(V_1)}_t, (V_2)_t$ are isomorphism. However, I also know $V_1, V_2$ are NOT birational. The other information I know is: The generic fibre are both abelian surfaces. I really could not imagine such varieties, the only thing might be an analogy is the Möbius strip. I was wondering if there is an argumement to show there must be something wrong in the construction as follows: because the fibres are isomorphism, it is also isomorphism nearby the fibres, and hence they two should be birational. Edit: Here is how I construct $V_1, V_2$. First, I have a smooth 3-fold $X$ fibreing over $\mathbb{P}^1$, and I have two finite groups $G_1 ,G_2 \subseteq {\rm Aut}(X)$ (one is abelian, the other is not abelian) acting on $X$ without fixed point.

If $V_1, V_2$ are birational, I guess they should have the same fundamental groups. Hence, they are not birational. As for they have the isomorphic fibres, I did this in a simply-mined, non-rigours way, and that is the part I worry most: As I know how does the group $G_i$ acting on coordinates of the generic points of $X$, and I know how does the generic points maps to $\mathbb{P}^1$. I just pick a general point $x$, and see what is the images under $G_i$. For $G_i\cdot x$ (i.e. the orbits) are in the fibre of the exactly same four points of $\mathbb{P}^1$ for both $G_1, G_2$.

To conclude it's enough to notice that $u: X_d \to W_d$ is a surjective map of schemes, so from the above description of $T_\bullet W_d$ and $R^1 \pi_* \mathcal{O}_{X\times X_d}$ as constant sheaves it follows that $$ u^* T_\bullet W_d \cong R^1 \pi_* \mathcal{O}_{X\times X_d}. $$",,"['algebraic-geometry', 'proof-verification', 'algebraic-curves', 'schemes']"

If the fiber over some point $p$ of $Y$ contains exactly one point of $X$, then $f$ is birational. (Since a finite map is affine, we  can reduce to the case $X=SpecA$, $Y=SpecB$) In browsing around trying to prove this, I came upon Vakil's definition of the degree of a finite morphism at a point (Section 13.7 of his online notes). He defines the degree of $f$ at $p$ to be the dimension of $(f_*O_X)_p \otimes _{O_{Y,p}} k(p)$ as a $k(p)$ vector space, where $k(p)$ denotes the residue field of $Y$ at $p$. In an exercise, he asserts that degree is an upper semicontinuous function of the point on $Y$. My feeling is that this solves my problem. Degree as defined above is the dimension of the vector space of functions on the fiber over the field $k(p)$ (=$k$, since I assumed algebraically closed). Morally, this should be the number of points in the fiber, with a basis of functions being those which send one point in the fiber to 1 and the others to 0.

All I have managed to show is that if $R^G$ is a finitely generated $S$-module, then $R$ also is, because since $R$ is a finitely generated $R^G$-module, I can use the fact that  $$ R = \sum_{i=1}^m R^G r_i = \sum_{i=1}^m \left( \sum_{j=1}^p S q_j \right) r_i = \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^p r_i q_j. $$ I don't need a full proof, just a hint towards a solution would be appreciated ; right now I just have no idea where to start. Edit: I asked my teacher and he confirms that all he really wanted was to give steps to show that $R^G$ was an affine $k$-algebra, so we can use whatever generators we want (which wasn't explicit in the question). I'll be fine for the rest, but thank you all for noticing I was doing an impossible question (or uselessly too hard).",,"['algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra']"

For each $x$, the residue field $\kappa(x)$ is a field extension of $k$. Why is this true? My understanding is that a scheme over a field really just amounts to a ring homomorphism $k \rightarrow O_X(X)$, so $O_X(X)$ is a $k$-algebra. My understanding of the residue at a point $x$ is that, since $X$ is by definition covered by affine schemes, $x$ is a prime ideal $P$ in some ring $A$. Then the localization of $A$ at the prime ideal corresponding to $x$ has a unique maximal ideal, and the quotient is called $\kappa(x)$. I don't see how from this, $\kappa(x)$ is a field extension of $k$. Edit: I thought about it a bit longer and the reasoning I have is this. A morphism $X \rightarrow$ Spec $k$ defines a homomorphism $k \rightarrow O_X(U)$ for every open $U \subset X$. The localization of $A$ at $P$ is isomorphic to the stalk $O_P$ (theorem in Hartshorne) and since $O_P$ is the direct limit of a system of $k$-algebras, it too is a $k$-algebra, so there is a map $k \rightarrow A_P$.

My understanding is that a scheme over a field really just amounts to a ring homomorphism $k \rightarrow O_X(X)$, so $O_X(X)$ is a $k$-algebra. My understanding of the residue at a point $x$ is that, since $X$ is by definition covered by affine schemes, $x$ is a prime ideal $P$ in some ring $A$. Then the localization of $A$ at the prime ideal corresponding to $x$ has a unique maximal ideal, and the quotient is called $\kappa(x)$. I don't see how from this, $\kappa(x)$ is a field extension of $k$. Edit: I thought about it a bit longer and the reasoning I have is this. A morphism $X \rightarrow$ Spec $k$ defines a homomorphism $k \rightarrow O_X(U)$ for every open $U \subset X$. The localization of $A$ at $P$ is isomorphic to the stalk $O_P$ (theorem in Hartshorne) and since $O_P$ is the direct limit of a system of $k$-algebras, it too is a $k$-algebra, so there is a map $k \rightarrow A_P$.

Consider an irreducible closed subset $Y\subseteq X$ and let $\eta$ be the generic point of $Y$ . I would like to know if the following is true. Question: The point $\eta$ is regular (i.e, $\mathcal{O}_{X,\eta}$ is a regular local ring) if and only if there is at least one closed point $x\in Y$ that is regular on $X$ . The if part of the question is true due to a theorem of Serre: The localization of a regular local ring is a regular local ring. Because, if the variety $Y$ is defined by the prime ideal $P$ inside an affine chart containing $x$ , then $(\mathcal{O}_{X,x})_{P\mathcal{O}_{X,x}}=\mathcal{O}_{X,\eta}$ . So I am interested in the only if part. Notice that any algebraic variety has at least one regular closed point (cf. the book of Liu, section 4.2 Lemma 2.21, where it is proved over any field under the assumption of $X$ being geometrically reduced). Hence, $Y$ has at least one closed point $x$ such that $\mathcal{O}_{Y,x}$ is regular. As we are assuming that $\mathcal{O}_{X,\eta}$ is regular as well maybe some kind of transitivity of the regular property (in the sense of this other question that I asked before) would imply that the point $x$ is regular in $X$ . Maybe the fact that the set of regular points in $Y$ is actually an open set (cf. Liu section 4.2 proposition 2.24) can be used to change the point $x$ in case some of them fails.

Question: The point is regular (i.e, is a regular local ring) if and only if there is at least one closed point that is regular on . The if part of the question is true due to a theorem of Serre: The localization of a regular local ring is a regular local ring. Because, if the variety is defined by the prime ideal inside an affine chart containing , then . So I am interested in the only if part. Notice that any algebraic variety has at least one regular closed point (cf. the book of Liu, section 4.2 Lemma 2.21, where it is proved over any field under the assumption of being geometrically reduced). Hence, has at least one closed point such that is regular. As we are assuming that is regular as well maybe some kind of transitivity of the regular property (in the sense of this other question that I asked before) would imply that the point is regular in . Maybe the fact that the set of regular points in is actually an open set (cf. Liu section 4.2 proposition 2.24) can be used to change the point in case some of them fails.
