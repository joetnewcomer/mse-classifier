35,What tools can show that (possibly irregular) dodecahedra do not fill space?,What tools can show that (possibly irregular) dodecahedra do not fill space?,,"Here is a fairly natural question: Can three-dimensional space be filled with convex polyhedra of the same incidence structure (if not the same geometry) as the regular dodecahedron, such that four pieces meet at every vertex? We don't require that the cells be congruent to one another, but we'll say that each dihedral angle must be strictly less than 180 degrees so as to forbid degenerate cases that actually form polyhedra with fewer faces. We'll also require that the tiling be ""face-to-face"", such that every point in space is in one of four categories: Strictly within the interior of a dodecahedron. On the boundary of exactly two (closed) dodecahedra, and strictly within the interior of a face of each. On the boundary of exactly three dodecahedra, and strictly within the interior of an edge of each. On the boundary of exactly four dodecahedra, and a vertex of each. That is, every face meets exactly one congruent face on the opposite side, every edge is shared between all its members without any sliding or offsets, etc. This makes the combinatorial incidence structure especially straightforward. I strongly suspect the answer is ""no"", and I'd like to give the following argument for it: As we build up any attempt at such a construction, we will be ""filling out"" the incidence structure of the cells of the 120-cell , with each decision forced by the way in which the dodecahedra must meet one another. So we can place an initial cell, and lay down its 12 neighbors; this will force 20 more to fill out the vertices one edge away from a vertex of the original cell in a second layer. After placing these, we'll lay down another 12 touching our first layer on the face opposite that which they touch the central cell. After that, we'll place another 30, then another 12, then another 20, then another 12, and then we'll find that the resulting union is a single dodecahedron, requiring exactly one more piece at each vertex, which is now forced to be concave and in fact to ""wrap around"" the entire arrangement in one go, its interior equal to the full rest of space. However, this argument doesn't seem incredibly rigorous, and it rests heavily on a particular four-dimensional object in a way that doesn't clearly generalize to similar questions. I'd like something more systematic. This argument is perhaps easier to feel the force of for the analogous two-dimensional question of tiling the plane with convex pentagons three to a vertex: when one tries, they cannot help but find themselves drawing a skeleton of the dodecahedron, and after completing two rings around a central pentagon there is nowhere to go: In the two-dimensional case, this less-than-perfectly-rigorous argument can be replaced with a more precise appeal to some invariants using Euler's formula: Consider a finite patch of pentagons in a tiling. Assign to every pentagon in this tiling a score as follows: if $a$ vertices are shared by one other pentagon in the patch, and $b$ vertices are shared by two other pentagons, the score is $1-a/4-b/6$ . Using Euler's formula $V-E+F=2$ , it's easy enough to see that the total score in a finite simply connected patch is always equal to $1$ . Now, suppose we had a tiling of the plane. Take a simply-connected patch $P$ of at least 7 pentagons, and add all pentagons sharing an edge with any of those 7 to create a larger simply connected patch $Q$ . Each of our starting pentagons now has a score of $1/6$ (since $b=5$ for a fully surrounded pentagon), so they contribute more than $1$ to the total in $Q$ . This means that at least one of the outer pentagons in $Q$ must have a negative score. But there is only one local arrangement that assigns a negative score to a pentagon, and it requires that none of that pentagon's neighbors be fully surrounded; since all of these outer pentagons border an inner pentagon, this is a contradiction. So it is impossible to arrange pentagons in the plane in a degree-3 way, even far enough out to surround a group of 7 central pentagons. (Note that this argument doesn't actually use convexity, only the graph-theoretic incidence structure.) However, I don't see how to perform an analogous argument in the polyhedral case, because the Euler characteristic for polychora is $V-E+F-C=0$ , which is invariant to e.g. having twice as many of everything so doesn't naturally lead to any upper bounds. I've spent some time playing with different possible invariants, and despite my intuitive feeling that some kind of resource is being used up as more dodecahedra are added, I haven't found a metric that describes this in a satisfactory way; most angles of attack on the problem end up petering out in a way that relates to the zero Euler characteristic. What sorts of machinery can be used to settle questions like these? Are there existing methods in the literature I should examine?","Here is a fairly natural question: Can three-dimensional space be filled with convex polyhedra of the same incidence structure (if not the same geometry) as the regular dodecahedron, such that four pieces meet at every vertex? We don't require that the cells be congruent to one another, but we'll say that each dihedral angle must be strictly less than 180 degrees so as to forbid degenerate cases that actually form polyhedra with fewer faces. We'll also require that the tiling be ""face-to-face"", such that every point in space is in one of four categories: Strictly within the interior of a dodecahedron. On the boundary of exactly two (closed) dodecahedra, and strictly within the interior of a face of each. On the boundary of exactly three dodecahedra, and strictly within the interior of an edge of each. On the boundary of exactly four dodecahedra, and a vertex of each. That is, every face meets exactly one congruent face on the opposite side, every edge is shared between all its members without any sliding or offsets, etc. This makes the combinatorial incidence structure especially straightforward. I strongly suspect the answer is ""no"", and I'd like to give the following argument for it: As we build up any attempt at such a construction, we will be ""filling out"" the incidence structure of the cells of the 120-cell , with each decision forced by the way in which the dodecahedra must meet one another. So we can place an initial cell, and lay down its 12 neighbors; this will force 20 more to fill out the vertices one edge away from a vertex of the original cell in a second layer. After placing these, we'll lay down another 12 touching our first layer on the face opposite that which they touch the central cell. After that, we'll place another 30, then another 12, then another 20, then another 12, and then we'll find that the resulting union is a single dodecahedron, requiring exactly one more piece at each vertex, which is now forced to be concave and in fact to ""wrap around"" the entire arrangement in one go, its interior equal to the full rest of space. However, this argument doesn't seem incredibly rigorous, and it rests heavily on a particular four-dimensional object in a way that doesn't clearly generalize to similar questions. I'd like something more systematic. This argument is perhaps easier to feel the force of for the analogous two-dimensional question of tiling the plane with convex pentagons three to a vertex: when one tries, they cannot help but find themselves drawing a skeleton of the dodecahedron, and after completing two rings around a central pentagon there is nowhere to go: In the two-dimensional case, this less-than-perfectly-rigorous argument can be replaced with a more precise appeal to some invariants using Euler's formula: Consider a finite patch of pentagons in a tiling. Assign to every pentagon in this tiling a score as follows: if vertices are shared by one other pentagon in the patch, and vertices are shared by two other pentagons, the score is . Using Euler's formula , it's easy enough to see that the total score in a finite simply connected patch is always equal to . Now, suppose we had a tiling of the plane. Take a simply-connected patch of at least 7 pentagons, and add all pentagons sharing an edge with any of those 7 to create a larger simply connected patch . Each of our starting pentagons now has a score of (since for a fully surrounded pentagon), so they contribute more than to the total in . This means that at least one of the outer pentagons in must have a negative score. But there is only one local arrangement that assigns a negative score to a pentagon, and it requires that none of that pentagon's neighbors be fully surrounded; since all of these outer pentagons border an inner pentagon, this is a contradiction. So it is impossible to arrange pentagons in the plane in a degree-3 way, even far enough out to surround a group of 7 central pentagons. (Note that this argument doesn't actually use convexity, only the graph-theoretic incidence structure.) However, I don't see how to perform an analogous argument in the polyhedral case, because the Euler characteristic for polychora is , which is invariant to e.g. having twice as many of everything so doesn't naturally lead to any upper bounds. I've spent some time playing with different possible invariants, and despite my intuitive feeling that some kind of resource is being used up as more dodecahedra are added, I haven't found a metric that describes this in a satisfactory way; most angles of attack on the problem end up petering out in a way that relates to the zero Euler characteristic.

40,"If a polyhedron's faces and vertex figures are convex, is the polyhedron convex?","If a polyhedron's faces and vertex figures are convex, is the polyhedron convex?",,"Suppose a polyhedron's faces are convex polygons, and its vertex figures are convex spherical polygons (or convex cones, depending on definitions). Must the polyhedron be convex? As a counter-example for the analogous question in 2D, the pentagram $\{5/2\}$ has convex ""faces"" (line segments) and convex vertex figures ( $36^\circ$ arcs; less than $180^\circ$ ) but is a non-convex, self-intersecting polygon. The polyhedron may be in 3D Euclidean, spheric, or hyperbolic space. -- Actually it doesn't matter, because these all have standard embeddings in 4D: $$\mathbb E^3=\{(x,y,z,w)\in\mathbb R^4\mid w=1\}$$ $$\mathbb S^3=\{(x,y,z,w)\in\mathbb R^4\mid x^2+y^2+z^2+w^2=1\}$$ $$\mathbb H^3=\{(x,y,z,w)\in\mathbb R^4\mid x^2+y^2+z^2-w^2=-1,\;w>0\}$$ The polyhedron is represented as a cone (or its intersection with the hypersurface). A point in 3D is represented as a ray, all the positive scalar multiples of some vector in $\mathbb R^4$ . So we might as well work in $\mathbb S^3$ , and use the standard dot product, though the following could be formulated in terms of general linear algebra (e.g. using quotient spaces instead of orthogonal complements). Let $A$ be an abstract 3-polytope , and $A_k$ be the set of rank $k$ elements of $A$ , for $k=-1,0,1,2,3$ . Let $\sigma$ be a function on $A$ with the following properties: If $x\in A_k$ , then $\sigma x$ is a $(k+1)$ -dimensional linear subspace of $\mathbb R^4$ . (If you prefer, consider its intersection with $\mathbb S^3$ , which is then a $k$ -dimensional geodesic subspace.) If $x\leq y$ in $A$ , then $\sigma x\subseteq\sigma y$ . This function is a realization of $A$ . (It's nondegenerate if the last part is strengthened: $x\leq y$ if and only if $\sigma x\subseteq\sigma y$ .) Let $v$ be a function on incident pairs in $A$ (differing in rank by $1$ ) with the following properties: If $A_k\ni x<y\in A_{k+1}$ , then $v(x,y)\in\mathbb S^3$ is a unit vector orthogonal to $\sigma x$ and contained in $\sigma y$ . Since the dimensions differ by $1$ , there are only $2$ such unit vectors, differing in sign. (This vector $v(x,y)$ is supposed to point from $\sigma x$ to the ""inside"" of $\sigma y$ , and $-v(x,y)$ to the ""outside"". These notions make sense for convex polytopes, and less sense for self-intersecting polytopes.) If $A_{k-1}\ni w<x<z$ and $x\neq y$ and $w<y<z\in A_{k+1}$ , then the exterior product $v(w,x)\wedge v(x,z)=-v(w,y)\wedge v(y,z)$ . (Note that $v(w,x)\cdot v(x,z)=0$ by the previous property.) Both of these unit bivectors are contained in the $1$ -dimensional space $\bigwedge^2\big(\sigma w^\perp\cap\sigma z\big)$ , so they must be equal up to sign. We require opposite signs. (If going from vertex $w$ to edge $x$ to face $z$ is turning clockwise, then going from vertex $w$ to the other edge $y$ to face $z$ should be turning anticlockwise.) This function gives a kind of orientation of the polyhedron. It also gives the angles in faces, and the dihedral angles. Suppose $w<x<z$ and $w<y<z$ are two edges meeting at a vertex in a face; then the angle $\theta$ between the edges is completely determined (modulo $2\pi$ ) by $\cos\theta=v(w,x)\cdot v(w,y)$ and $\sin\theta=v(w,x)\cdot v(y,z)$ . In fact, given $A$ , and the angles and edge lengths, we can reconstruct $\sigma$ and $v$ , up to isometry of $\mathbb S^3$ . Likewise, given $A$ and $v$ , we can reconstruct $\sigma$ . All of that is just my idea of an (oriented) not-necessarily-convex polyhedron in spheric space. (Of course it could be modified for Euclidean or hyperbolic space. But those modifications only involve the metrical properties, not the incidence relations or convexity.) Now to formalize the question. I'll use the notation $[x,z]_k=\{y\in A_k\mid x\leq y\leq z\}$ . Edges are convex: $$\forall w\in A_{-1},\;\forall z\in A_1,\;\forall x\in[w,z]_0,\;\forall y\in[w,z]_0, \\ (y=x)\lor\big(v(x,z)\cdot v(w,y)>0\big).$$ Angles in faces are convex: $$\forall w\in A_0,\;\forall z\in A_2,\;\forall x\in[w,z]_1,\;\forall y\in[w,z]_1, \\ (y=x)\lor\big(v(x,z)\cdot v(w,y)>0\big).$$ Dihedral angles are convex: $$\forall w\in A_1,\;\forall z\in A_3,\;\forall x\in[w,z]_2,\;\forall y\in[w,z]_2, \\ (y=x)\lor\big(v(x,z)\cdot v(w,y)>0\big).$$ Faces are convex: $$\forall w\in A_{-1},\;\forall z\in A_2,\;\forall x\in[w,z]_1,\;\forall y\in[w,z]_0, \\ (y\leq x)\lor\big(v(x,z)\cdot v(w,y)>0\big)$$ (in addition to edge and angle convexity for the face $z$ ; but we've already specified edge and angle convexity for everything). Vertex figures are convex: $$\forall w\in A_0,\;\forall z\in A_3,\;\forall x\in[w,z]_2,\;\forall y\in[w,z]_1, \\ (y\leq x)\lor\big(v(x,z)\cdot v(w,y)>0\big).$$ Polyhedron is convex? $$\forall w\in A_{-1},\;\forall z\in A_3,\;\forall x\in[w,z]_2,\;\forall y\in[w,z]_0, \\ (y\leq x)\lor\big(v(x,z)\cdot v(w,y)>0\big)$$ In words, a polyhedron is convex , if each vertex is inside the half-space for each face (unless the vertex is part of the face), and the faces and vertex figures are convex polygons. I haven't shown that this definition of a convex polyhedron is equivalent to the usual definitions (intersection of a finite set of half-spaces, convex hull of a finite set of points in 3D, or conical hull of a finite set of vectors in 4D). At least, I have shown it to myself. If someone wants to ask a new Question about the equivalence, I suppose I could answer. For now, take it for granted. Here's an idea for a proof, in the case of Euclidean space. An element $x\in A_k$ is realized as a $k$ -dimensional affine subspace $\sigma x\subset\mathbb E^3\cong\mathbb R^3$ . Let's ignore the distinction between a $0$ -dimensional subspace and the unique point it contains, so that a vertex $x\in A_0$ has $\sigma x\in\mathbb E^3$ rather than $\sigma x\subset\mathbb E^3$ . Let $l\in A_{-1}$ and $g\in A_3$ be the least and greatest elements. Take an arbitrary face $f$ of the polyhedron, with inward normal vector $v(f,g)$ . Let $c\in\mathbb R$ be the constant such that $v(f,g)\cdot\sigma x=c$ for all vertices $x\leq f$ . We want to show that $v(f,g)\cdot\sigma x>c$ for all other vertices $x\not\leq f$ . Certainly $v(f,g)\cdot\sigma y>c$ for any vertex $y$ adjacent to a vertex $x\leq f$ . Since the vertex figures are convex, we have $v(f,g)\cdot v(x,e)>0$ for any edge $x\leq e\not\leq f$ . The adjacent vertex is $\sigma y=\sigma x+t\,v(x,e)$ , where $t>0$ is the length of the edge; thus $v(f,g)\cdot\sigma y=v(f,g)\cdot\sigma x+t\,v(f,g)\cdot v(x,e)>c$ . By similar reasoning, given $x\leq f$ , any vertex $y$ in a face containing $x$ also has $v(f,g)\cdot\sigma y>c$ , because $\sigma y$ is in the (2D) convex cone generated by two edges $e,e'\geq x$ . So we have, at least, a subset $B\subseteq A$ of the polyhedron, where all vertices are known to be either in $f$ or on the positive side of $f$ . Consider $B$ as a surface, with a curve as its boundary. Take the vertex $x$ on the boundary of $B$ with the smallest value of $v(f,g)\cdot\sigma x$ . It follows that $v(f,g)\cdot v(x,e)\geq0$ for any edge $e\geq x$ on the boundary, as that edge connects $x$ to another vertex on the boundary which must not have a smaller dot product with $v(f,g)$ . Add to $B$ the faces incident with $x$ , along with their edges and vertices, thus changing the boundary of $B$ so that it no longer contains $x$ . It should be the case that any such new vertex $y$ has $v(f,g)\cdot\sigma y\geq v(f,g)\cdot\sigma x$ , as a result of the convexity of the vertex figure at $x$ (but I'm not sure about this). Repeat until $B=A$ . (Since the polyhedron is connected, every vertex will be reached.) The dot product with $v(f,g)$ is always increasing, thus always greater than $c$ . Can we fill in the gaps in this proof? Can it be modified for spheric space? The argument in the previous section depends on finiteness, to find a minimum, and to reach all vertices eventually. I haven't yet specified that $A$ must be a finite set. Here's an infinite counter-example: a pentagrammic cylinder, or a stack of pentagrammic prisms, in hyperbolic space. Using hyperbolic cylindrical coordinates, the vertices are located at $$x_{(m,n)}=(\sinh(a)\cos(2m\cdot72^\circ),\sinh(a)\sin(2m\cdot72^\circ),\cosh(a)\sinh(nb),\cosh(a)\cosh(nb)),$$ $$m\in\mathbb Z\bmod5,\quad n\in\mathbb Z.$$ ( $a$ is the cylinder's radius. $b$ is a translation distance along the cylinder's axis.) The polyhedron's faces are ""rectangles"", with vertex sets of the form $\{x_{(m,n)},x_{(m,n+1)},x_{(m+1,n)},x_{(m+1,n+1)}\}$ . These are convex. (The angles in a face are less than $90^\circ$ , because of the hyperbolic geometry. We need a word to replace ""rectangle"" which refers to symmetry rather than angles.) The polyhedron's vertex figures are also convex, being rhombic. (In Euclidean space, one type of edge would have a dihedral angle of $180^\circ$ , violating strict convexity, but in hyperbolic space it's less than $180^\circ$ .) The polyhedron as a whole is not convex, because the plane containing $\{x_{(0,0)},x_{(0,1)},x_{(1,0)},x_{(1,1)}\}$ has some vertices on both sides; e.g. $x_{(2,0)}$ and $x_{(3,0)}$ are separated by that plane. Of course this could be projected to Euclidean space (Beltrami-Klein model; divide the first three coordinates by the fourth), but then it would have less symmetry, and two accumulation points $(0,0,\pm1)$ .","Suppose a polyhedron's faces are convex polygons, and its vertex figures are convex spherical polygons (or convex cones, depending on definitions).

There are three mixtilinear incircles for any nondegenerate triangle. The triangle connecting the centers of the three mixtilinear incircles is called the mixtilinear triangle of the first triangle. My impression is that the mixtilinear triangle always seems to be smaller than the original triangle. So, assuming that (or not assuming it but only looking at triangles for which it is true), my question is as follows: If one were to take the mixtilinear triangle of the mixtilinear triangle of the mixtilinear triangle of...of the original triangle, indefinitely, and it were to converge to a point, would that point have any geometric relationship to the original triangle? For example, might it be along the Euler line? I'd like to note that, even assuming my above observation about the size of the mixtilinear incircle is true (and if it's not, I'd be curious to see a counterexample!), there's no way of procedurally determining which was the original triangle, so any property satisfied by that point with regard to the original triangle would also have to be satisfied with regard to any of the infinitely many mixtilinear and sub-mixtilinear triangles.

The problem is that none of  the answers are giving a clear and steady answer. I found this answer that looked very interesting, but I still have my doubts about it. Snetfel explained that we can use a sweep-line algorithm. Here is a brief summary: We make a priority queue containing all $x$ points of left $(x-r)$ and right $ (x+r)$ extremas of the circles. We then use a binary tree to respresent the sweep-line status. Whenever we encounter a left extrema of a circle, we add it to the status and check for intersections with every other active circle in the status. Whenever we encounter a right extrema of a circle, we remove it from the status. Here you can find a video I made so you can have a better understanding. But does this method do the job in $O((n+s)\log(n))$ time as we are still checking each added circle to all other circles in the status? I tried another method which failed miserably. My failed attempt What I tried is the following. We again make a priority queue containing all $x$ points of left $(x-r)$ and right $(x+r)$ extremas of the circles.

51,Surface Area of $n$-Dimensional Sphere with Multiple Hyperplanar Cuts,Surface Area of -Dimensional Sphere with Multiple Hyperplanar Cuts,n,"Let $S^{n-1}\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ be the unit sphere, and $v_1, \cdots, v_m\in S^{n-1}$ be $n$ -dimensional unit vectors. Each of these vectors defines an $n-1$ dimensional hyperplane, which cuts $S^{n-1}$ in exactly half. This hyperplane is oriented by the vector $v_i$ , meaning it designates a set of exactly half of the points on the sphere; call this set $A_{v_i}$ . Now, let $$A=\bigcup_{1\leq i\leq m}A_{v_i}$$ What is the surface area of $A$ ? Or, equivalently, what portion of the total surface area of $S^{n-1}$ is contained in $A$ ? More importantly, how does one compute this directly from $v_1, \cdots, v_m$ ? Here are a few remarks that may be helpful. First, note that $A$ can be thought of as $A=\{v\in S^{n-1}\text{ | }\exists i\text{ with } v\cdot v_i\geq 0\}$ , since the half- $\mathbb{R}^n$ space which each vector $v_i$ defines is precisely equivalent to the set of all vectors which project non-negatively onto $v_i$ . Additionally, this question may be easier to answer with low values for $m$ ; straightforwardly, when $m=2$ , one can just look at the angle between the vectors to determine the answer, though I do not see how to extend this... I think that an even answer which treats cases for values of $m\leq 5$ , for example, would be interesting. Edit : It seems this question may be quite a bit harder than anticipated, as can be see here . However, as mentioned above, I still think that an explicit answer for the first few values of $m$ would be interesting. Let $|A|$ denote the measure of $A$ . When $m=2$ , the answer is simply $|A|=\frac{\pi-\cos^{-1}(v_1\cdot v_2)}{2\pi}$ .

Let $p=11$ . For each $0 < n < p$ consider the parabola $f^p_n(x) \sim x^2$ with $f^p_n(n)=n^2\ \%\ p$ , i.e. the parabola with vertex $(0,0)$ on which the point $(n,n^2\ \%\ p)$ lies: Equivalently — because $k^2\ \%\ p = (p-k)^2\ \%\ p$ — one may consider the parabola $f^p_n(x) \sim (p-x)^2$ , i.e. the parabola with vertex $(p,0)$ on which the point $(n,n^2\ \%\ p)$ lies: The important fact is, that when $p$ is prime all points $(k,k^2)$ lie on $f^p_n(x)$ modulo $p$ for all $0 < n < p$ . Lying on $f^p_n$ modulo $p$ means lying on $f^p_n$ when bending the square $[0,p]\times [0,p]$ to a torus, i.e. identifying its opposite sides. Here you see that all $(k,k^2)$ lie on $f^{11}_1$ modulo $11$ , resp. on $f^{11}_4$ and $f^{11}_{10}$ : Two questions arise: How many different parabolas $f^p_n$ are there for a given $p$ ? Note that $f^p_n = f^p_1$ for $n^2 < p$ .

For $f^p_1$ and $k^2 < p$ it's the cell $(1,1)$ (top left), obviously. For $f^{p}_1$ and $k=p-1$ it's the cell $(1,p-1)$ . For $f^{p}_{p-1}$ and $k=1$ it's the cell $(p-1,p-1)$ . For $f^{11}_4$ and $k=7$ , resp. $f^{11}_5$ and $k=6$ you will find, that the grid cell isn't displayed above (too far to the right). But one may try to determine it by looking at the torus chart, e.g. for $f^{11}_4$ : Counting lines in the chart for $f^{11}_{4}$ reveals that for the ""hit"" cell $(i,j)$ of $k=7$ it holds that $i+j \approx 60$ . The same works for the ""hit"" cell $(i,j)$ of $k=1$ for $f^{11}_{10}$ (see above) with $i+j = 20$ .

Define the disturbance of the four points as: $$ D(P_1,P_2,P_3,P_4)=\sum_{1 \leq i < j \leq 4} \frac{1}{|P_i-P_j|^2}$$ Where $|P_i-P_j|$ is the euclidean distance between $P_i$ and $P_j$.

Since we are only considering the shape (up to rotation), we can assume w.l.o.g. that $P_1=(1,0,0)$, and that $P_2$ also lies on the plane $z=0$.

Here are some descriptions I could think of, but all of them feel rather bulky. I hope they are as equivalent to one another as I think they are, and I hope there is something simpler equivalent to all of them. a direct similarity transformation which is not a translation (by a non-zero displacement) a homothety (possibly with factor $1$) followed by rotation (with possibly zero angle) an orientation-preserving similarity with at least one fixed point a direct similitude with a well-defined similitude center , or the identity what $z\mapsto a(z-c)+c$ describes in the complex plane , for some fixed $a,c\in\mathbb C$ (with $a\neq 0$) As a native German, I tend to think about this using the German term “ Drehstreckung ” which literally translates to “rotation-dilation”.
