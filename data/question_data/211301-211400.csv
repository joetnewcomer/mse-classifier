9,Recommendations for a second look at core subjects,Recommendations for a second look at core subjects,,"I'm starting a master's program in mathematics in September and I would like to do some review over summer, before I start, so I am looking for book recommendations. My background is in engineering (electrical and physics), but I took some pure mathematics courses at university. However, this was a while ago, since it has been a couple of years since I graduated. Analysis My analysis class used Rudin's Principles of Mathematical Analysis . We read most of the book except the final two chapters on differential forms and Lebesgue theory, and only parts of the chapter on special functions. Overall I liked the book, though the material on special functions and functions of multiple variables was perhaps too compact; I still feel somewhat weak in these areas. (I recall the proof of the implicit function theorem to be particularly difficult.) To review analysis I am considering either to: Go back to Rudin and do more exercises. I did most of the book exercises in the early chapters (1-2), but not very many in the later chapters when I took the course (because the homework problems written by the teacher took most of my time). Instead go on to Rudin's Real and Complex Analysis . Perhaps it is more useful to take the next step, instead of dwelling on the previous? Read some other author, to get a complementary viewpoint on the material. I have considered Tao's Analysis I and II , though I am a little worried that they may be too verbose (especially for review!), requiring two whole volumes. What would you recommend? Abstract algebra My abstract algebra class used Judson's Abstract Algebra: Theory and Applications , but the course emphasis was certainly on the core theory rather than the applications. My experience with this book was not great, but that is likely largely due to mathematical immaturity; this was the first rigorous mathematics course I took, even before real analysis. I am considering using Hungerford's Algebra (not Abstract Algebra: An Introduction ) for review. It is more compact than the book by Dummit and Foote, which I have also considered. Is Hungerford's Algebra a good choice? Are there better alternatives? Update 1: I started reading Hungerford and found that he requires proper subsets to be nonempty. Similarly he excludes the trivial group from being a proper subgroup. This is annoying, and turned me off somewhat. Update 2: A commenter suggested Aluffi's Algebra: Chapter 0 , which seems promising, if perhaps a bit too conversational (and lengthy!). I like that it seems to offer quite a different perspective than Judson's text. Other topics Maybe it would also be useful to study/review some other topics before starting. For example, while I have used a lot of linear algebra (including some advanced topics) in theoretical physics, I have not properly studied linear algebra beyond the basic engineering level. Perhaps some review of discrete mathematics would also be good; I took one somewhat rigorous course in the subject, though it was aimed at engineers.

I have what I think is a proof for the statement but it only shows that the diameter of the graph is at most $4$ . Here's a brief sketch of my argument; my question is whether or not the statement in the title is even true and if so, whether my proof of the statement with the relaxed diameter condition is correct, then how I can modify it to prove the title statement. Proof (of modified statement): Let $x$ be a vertex in graph $G$ with $\deg(x) = \Delta(G)$ and $y$ be a vertex with $\deg(y) = \delta(G)$ . Then assume $x$ and $y$ are non-adjacent. Also assume $x \neq y$ . Since $\deg(x) + \deg(y) \geq n-1$ and they are non-adjacent and distinct, we know (by the pigeonhole principle) that $x$ and $y$ share at least one neighbor. In fact, $x$ and $u$ share at least one neighbor for any vertex $u \in V(G)$ since the inequality holds for any vertex not equal to $y$ as well. Thus, every vertex $u$ in the graph is either adjacent to $x$ or there is a $u-x$ path of length $2$ . Therefore, $G$ is connected and has diameter at most $4$ since the longest distance between any two vertices in the graph is at most $4$ , with two disjoint paths of length $2$ through $x$ . If $x$ and $y$ are adjacent, the argument can still be applied for any vertex $u$ and $x$ and you can always show that when $u$ and $x$ are non-adjacent, they must share a common vertex. If $x = y$ then we have $\Delta(G) = \delta(G)$ so $\delta(G) + \delta(G) \geq n-1$ therefore $\delta(G) \geq \frac{n-1}{2}$ , and it is known that such a graph must be connected with diameter at most $2$ by the same argument pigeonhole principle argument provided above.

In mcs.pdf , it has Problem 7.25 in p251(#259). One version of the the Ackermann function $A:\mathbb{N}^2 \to \mathbb{N}$ is defined recursively by the following rules: $$   \begin{align*}     A(m, n)&::=2n  &&\text{if } m = 0 \text{ or } n \le 1,  &(\text{A-base})\\ A(m, n)&::=A(m-1,A(m,n-1))  &&\text{otherwise}  &(AA)   \end{align*} $$ Prove that if $B:\mathbb{N}^2 \to \mathbb{N}$ is a partial function that satisfies this same definition, then $B$ is total and $B=A$ . The reason to prove $B=A$ is due to the possibility of Collatz recurrence Mathematicians have been wondering about this function specification, known as the Collatz conjecture for a while $$ f_4(n)::=\begin{cases}   1,&&\text{if }n\le 1,\\   f_4(n/2)&&\text{if }n> 1\text{ is even},\\   f_4(3n+1)&&\text{if }n> 1\text{ is odd}.\tag{7.5} \end{cases} $$ For example, $f_4(3)= 1$ because $$f_4(3)::= f_4(10)::=f_4(5)::=f_4(16)::=f_4(8)::=f_4(4)::=f_4(2)::=f_4(1)::=1$$ The constant function equal to 1 will satisfy (7.5), but it’s not known if another function does as well . The problem is that the third case specifies $f_4(n)$ in terms of $f_4$ at arguments larger than $n$ , and so cannot be justified by induction on $\mathbb{N}$ The reference of problem in the chpater contents $$ f_2(n)::=\begin{cases}   0,&&\text{if }n=0,\\   f_2(n+1)&&\text{otherwise}.\tag{7.3} \end{cases} $$ This “definition” has a base case, but still doesn’t uniquely determine $f_2$ . Any function that is 0 at 0 and constant everywhere else would satisfy the specification, so (7.3) also does not uniquely define anything ... The Ackermann function can be defined recursively as the function A given by the following rules: $$   \begin{align*}     A(m, n)&=2n  &&\text{if } m = 0 \text{ or } n \le 1,  &(7.6)\\ A(m, n)&=A(m-1,A(m,n-1))  &&\text{otherwise.}  &(7.7)   \end{align*} $$ Now these rules are unusual because the definition of $A(m, n)$ involves an evaluation of A at arguments that may be a lot bigger than m and n . The definitions of $f_4$ above showed how definitions of function values at small argument values in terms of larger one can easily lead to nonterminating evaluations. The definition of the Ackermann function is actually ok, but proving this takes some ingenuity (see Problem 7.25). So the key part is to ensure ""definitions of function values at small argument values in terms of larger one"" is well-defined. As Julio Di Egidio says, the proof from wikipedia (see point 1) is only one sketch but maybe not rigorous. But I can't think of one more rigorous proof than that because IMHO for one arbitrary $A(m,n)$ we can only follow the recursion implied in the definition as wikipedia shows to get the final value of it. Here is my edited proof (mainly rephrased from my comments following hints) based on wikipedia and comment hints which is different from the original one (I directly edited in the question as this comment recommends). Instead of directly manipulating with one arbitrary $A(m,n),m>0,n>1$ , we prove by induction without proving the lexicographic order on Products of finite Well-Ordered Sets is well-ordered . This can be always done due to equivalence between Well ordering principle (WOP) and induction. (A-base): $(m=0)\lor (n\le 1)$ . $A(m,n)$ is well-defined by definition. (AA): Assume for $(m',n')<(m,n)$ (Here we needs to prove the lexicographic order is totally ordered ), $A(m',n')$ is well-defined. Then $A(m,n)=A(m-1,A(m,n-1))$ is well-defined since $m-1\ge 0,n-1>0$ which ensures $A(m-1,A(m,n-1))$ can be defined. Then $A(m-1,k),k\in\mathbb{N}$ and $A(m,n-1)$ are well defined. Then $A(m,n)$ is well-defined for $\mathbb{N}^2$ , i.e. total and unique. Compared with (7.3) and (7.5) where $<$ is defined in $\mathbb{N}$ , the induction in Problem 7.25 doesn't depend on one greater object defined by $<$ in $\mathbb{N}^2$ . So the behavior is well-defined. Q: As Izaak van Dongen says, the above proof is rigorous (Hope my rephrase doesn't misunderstand what Izaak van Dongen says).

It's easy to demonstrate that the integer sequence $\{c_i\} = |{\rm Im}(f^i)|$ : is non increasing; consists of a strictly decreasing sequence up to a certain $n'$ , after which becomes constant; $n' \leq n$ where $n'$ , as defined above, is the maximum number for which $i \leq n' \implies \{c_i\} = |{\rm Im}(f^{i})|$ is strictly decreasing; Quick demonstration: $\forall i \geq 1, {\rm Im}(f^i) = {\rm Im}(f|_{{\rm Im}(f^{i-1})})$ while $f^0$ is identity and $f|_A$ means "" $f$ restricted to $A$ "". Obviously, either $\left|\textrm{Im}(f|_{\textrm{Im}(f^{i-1})})\right| < |\textrm{Im}(f^{i-1})|$ or $\left|\textrm{Im}(f|_{\textrm{Im}(f^{i-1})})\right| = |\textrm{Im}(f^{i-1})|$ which demonstrates 1. 2 derives from the fact $|\textrm{Im}(f|_{\textrm{Im}(f^{i-1})})| = |\textrm{Im}(f^{i-1})|$ means that $f|_{\textrm{Im}(f^{i-1})}$ is a permutation, and permutations are closed with respect of composition. 3 follows from observing the simple example in which $S = \{1, 2, \cdots, n', \cdots, n\}$ and $f(x) = x+1$ , for $x \in \{1, \cdots, n-1\}$ and $f(n) = n'$ .

15,A discrete multiple sum over strictly increasing integer sequences.,A discrete multiple sum over strictly increasing integer sequences.,,"Let $l \ge 1$ and $m \ge 0$ and $k \ge l$ be integers. Then let ${\bf A}= \left( A_\eta \right)_{\eta=1}^l$ and ${\bf B}= \left( B_\eta \right)_{\eta=1}^l$ be parameters. We define the following multiple sum: \begin{equation} {\mathfrak S}_{l,m}^{({\bf A},{\bf B})} (k):= \sum\limits_{1 \le j_1 < j_2 < \cdots < j_l \le k} \prod\limits_{\eta=0}^{l-1} (j_{\eta+1} + A_{\eta+1})^{(m+1)} (j_{\eta+1} + B_{\eta+1})^{(m)} \tag{1} \end{equation} This sum appears in a natural way when finding the Frobenius power series solution to a certain class of ordinary differential equations with polynomial coefficients, see this post . We define auxiliary coefficients as follows: \begin{eqnarray} &&{\mathfrak C}_l= -\sum\limits_{\eta=1}^l \sum\limits_{\xi=0}^{(2(l-\eta)+1)m+l-\eta} \Lambda^{(l,\eta)}_\xi \cdot (A_\eta-l+\eta)^{(m+l-\eta+2+\xi)}\\ &&\Lambda^{(l+1,\eta)}_\xi = \sum\limits_{\xi_2=0 \vee \xi-( (2(l-\eta)+1)m+l-\eta )}^{(2m+1) \wedge \xi} \sum\limits_{\xi_1=0 \vee (\xi_2-m-1)}^m \\ && \left( \right. \\ && \left. \Lambda^{(l,\eta)}_{\xi-\xi_2} \cdot (B_{l+1} - A_{l+1}-m-1)^{(m-\xi_1)} (A_{l+1} - A_\eta-(m+\xi-\xi_2)-1)^{(m+1+\xi_1-\xi_2)} \cdot \binom{m+1+\xi_1}{\xi_2} \binom{m}{\xi_1} \cdot 1_{\eta \le l} + \right.\\ && \left. {\mathfrak C}_l (B_{l+1} - A_{l+1}-m-1)^{(m-\xi)} \cdot \binom{m}{\xi} \cdot 1_{\eta=l+1} \right. \\ && \left. \right) \cdot \frac{1}{m+l-\eta+3+\xi} \tag{2a} \end{eqnarray} for $l=1,2,\cdots$ , $\eta=1,\cdots,l+1$ and $\xi=0,\cdots, (2(l+1-\eta)+1)m+l+1-\eta$ subject to $\Lambda^{(1,1)}_\xi = (B_1-A_1-m-1)^{(m-\xi)} \binom{m}{\xi}/(m+2+\xi) $ . We have shown that this multiple sum admits the following neat closed form expression below. \begin{equation} {\mathfrak S}_{l,m}^{({\bf A},{\bf B})} (k) =  \sum\limits_{\eta=1}^l \sum\limits_{\xi=0}^{(2(l-\eta)+1) m+l-\eta} \Lambda^{(l,\eta)}_\xi \cdot \left( (k+A_\eta-(l-\eta))^{(m+(l-\eta+2)+\xi)} - (0+A_\eta-(l-\eta))^{(m+(l-\eta+2)+\xi)} \right) \tag{2} \end{equation} We have derived the result by decomposing the product of Pochhammer symbols into linear combinations of single Pochhammer symbols  and then performing the sums bottom -up by using the Pascal triangle identity $\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n+1}{k+1} - \binom{n}{k+1}$ . Note: We coefficient at the highest  order term in $(2)$ are given below: \begin{eqnarray} &&\Lambda^{(l,1)}_{\xi_m(l)} = \frac{1}{l! (2m+2)^l} \\ \end{eqnarray} where $\xi_m(l):= (2(l-1)+1)m+l-1$ . Proof by induction: Fix $l$ and take the new factor in the term in the multiple sum and decompose that factor into a linear combination of upper Pochhammer symbols as follows: \begin{equation} (j_{l+1} + A_{l+1})^{(m_1)} (j_{l+1} + B_{l+1})^{(m_2)}  = \sum\limits_{\xi_1=0}^{m_2} (B_{l+1}-A_{l+1}-(m_1))^{(m_2-\xi_1)} \cdot \binom{m_2}{\xi_1} \cdot (j_{l+1} + A_{l+1})^{(m_1+\xi_1)} \tag{3a} \end{equation} for integer $m_1,m_2 \ge 0$ . Now we in $(1)$ we replace $k \rightarrow j_{l+1}-1$ and multiply both sides of it by $(3)$ . Then we have: \begin{eqnarray} &&\sum\limits_{1 \le j_1 < j_2 <  \cdots < j_l < j_{l+1} } \prod\limits_{\eta=0}^l (j_{\eta+1} + A_{\eta+1})^{(m+1)} (j_{\eta+1} + B_{\eta+1})^{(m)} = \\ && \left. \sum\limits_{\eta=1}^l \sum\limits_{\xi=0}^{(2(l-\eta)+1)m+l-\eta} \sum\limits_{\xi_1=0}^m \Lambda^{(l,\eta)}_\xi \cdot (B_{l+1}-A_{l+1}-(m+1))^{(\eta-\xi_1)} \cdot \binom{m}{\xi_1} \cdot \underline{\underline{ (j_{l+1} + A_\eta -(l-\eta+1))^{(m+(l-\eta+2)+\xi)} (j_{l+1}+A_{l+1})^{(m+1+\xi_1)}}} + \right. \\ && {\mathfrak C}_l  \sum\limits_{\xi_1=0}^m (B_{l+1}-A_{l+1}-(m+1))^{(\eta-\xi_1)} \cdot \binom{m}{\xi_1} \cdot \underline{(j_{l+1}+A_{l+1})^{(m+1+\xi_1)}} \tag{3b} \end{eqnarray} Now we decompose the doubly underlined term by using $(3b)$ repeatedly. We have: \begin{eqnarray} &&\sum\limits_{1 \le j_1 < j_2 <  \cdots < j_l < j_{l+1} } \prod\limits_{\eta=0}^l (j_{\eta+1} + A_{\eta+1})^{(m+1)} (j_{\eta+1} + B_{\eta+1})^{(m)} = \\ && \left. \sum\limits_{\eta=1}^l \sum\limits_{\xi=0}^{(2(l-\eta)+1)m+l-\eta} \sum\limits_{\xi_1=0}^m \sum\limits_{\xi_2=0}^{m+1+\xi_1} \Lambda^{(l,\eta)}_\xi \cdot (B_{l+1}-A_{l+1}-(m+1))^{(\eta-\xi_1)} \cdot \binom{m}{\xi_1} \cdot (A_{l+1} - (A_\eta-(l-\eta+1)) - (m+l-\eta+2+\xi))^{(m+1+\xi_1-\xi_2)} \cdot \binom{m+1+\xi_1}{\xi_2} \cdot \underline{(j_{l+1} + A_\eta-(l-\eta+1))^{((m+l-\eta+2+\xi+\xi_2)}} + \right. \\ && {\mathfrak C}_l  \sum\limits_{\xi_1=0}^m (B_{l+1}-A_{l+1}-(m+1))^{(\eta-\xi_1)} \cdot \binom{m}{\xi_1} \cdot \underline{(j_{l+1}+A_{l+1})^{(m+1+\xi_1)}} \tag{3c} \end{eqnarray} Now we do the sum over $j_{l+1} = 1,\cdots, l$ by using the identity $ \sum\limits_{j=1}^k (j + A)^{(m)} = ((k+A)^{(m+1)} - A^{(m+1)})/(m+1)$ . We have: \begin{eqnarray} &&\sum\limits_{1 \le j_1 < j_2 <  \cdots < j_l < j_{l+1} \le k} \prod\limits_{\eta=0}^l (j_{\eta+1} + A_{\eta+1})^{(m+1)} (j_{\eta+1} + B_{\eta+1})^{(m)} = \\ && \left. \sum\limits_{\eta=1}^l \sum\limits_{\xi=0}^{(2(l-\eta)+1)m+l-\eta} \sum\limits_{\xi_1=0}^m \sum\limits_{\xi_2=0}^{m+1+\xi_1} \Lambda^{(l,\eta)}_\xi \cdot (B_{l+1}-A_{l+1}-(m+1))^{(\eta-\xi_1)} \cdot \binom{m}{\xi_1} \cdot (A_{l+1} - (A_\eta-(l-\eta+1)) - (m+l-\eta+2+\xi))^{(m+1+\xi_1-\xi_2)} \cdot \binom{m+1+\xi_1}{\xi_2} \cdot % %\underline{(j_{l+1} + A_\eta-(l-\eta+1))^{((m+l-\eta+2+\xi+\xi_2)}} \frac{(k+A_\eta-(l-\eta+1))^{(m+l-\eta+3+\xi+\xi_2)} - (A_\eta-(l-\eta+1))^{(m+l-\eta+3+\xi+\xi_2)}}{m+l-\eta+3+\xi+\xi_2} % + \right. \\ && {\mathfrak C}_l  \sum\limits_{\xi_1=0}^m (B_{l+1}-A_{l+1}-(m+1))^{(\eta-\xi_1)} \cdot \binom{m}{\xi_1} \cdot % %\underline{(j_{l+1}+A_{l+1})^{(m+1+\xi_1)}}  % \frac{(k+A_{l+1})^{(m+2+\xi_1)} - (A_{l+1})^{(m+2+\xi_1)}}{m+2+\xi_1} \tag{3d} \end{eqnarray} Now we simplify. We firstly move the sum over $\xi_1$ to the very right (to the very bottom of the nested multiple sum) and then we substitute $\xi+\xi_2 \rightarrow \xi$ . This yields: \begin{eqnarray} &&\sum\limits_{1 \le j_1 < j_2 <  \cdots < j_l < j_{l+1} \le k} \prod\limits_{\eta=0}^l (j_{\eta+1} + A_{\eta+1})^{(m+1)} (j_{\eta+1} + B_{\eta+1})^{(m)} = \\ && \left. \sum\limits_{\eta=1}^l \sum\limits_{\xi=0}^{(2(l+1-\eta)+1)m+l+1-\eta} \right. \\ && \left. \left( % \left( \sum\limits_{\xi_2=0 \vee((2(l-\eta)+1)m+l-\eta)}^{(2m+1) \wedge \xi} \sum\limits_{\xi_1=0 \vee (\xi_2-m-1)}^m \Lambda^{(l,\eta)}_{\xi-\xi_2} \cdot % (B_{l+1}-A_{l+1} -(m+1))^{(m-\xi_1)} \binom{m}{\xi_1} \cdot (A_{l+1}-(A_\eta-(l-\eta+1)) - (m+l-\eta+2+\xi-\xi_2))^{(m+1+\xi_1-\xi_2)} \binom{m+1+\xi_1}{\xi_2} \right) \cdot  \frac{ (k+A_\eta-(l-\eta+1))^{(m+(l-\eta+3)+\xi)} - (A_\eta-(l-\eta+1))^{(m+(l-\eta+3)+\xi)} }{m+l-\eta+3+\xi} % % \right) +\right. \\ && {\mathfrak C}_l  \sum\limits_{\xi_1=0}^m (B_{l+1}-A_{l+1}-(m+1))^{(\eta-\xi_1)} \cdot \binom{m}{\xi_1} \cdot \frac{(k+A_{l+1})^{(m+2+\xi_1)} - (A_{l+1})^{(m+2+\xi_1)}}{m+2+\xi_1} \tag{3e} \end{eqnarray} Now we notice that the term in the last, single, sum is equal to the term in the double sum above it at $\eta = l+1$ . As such we absorb the last single sum  into the double sum above it at $\eta = l+1$ .

Then let and be parameters. We define the following multiple sum: This sum appears in a natural way when finding the Frobenius power series solution to a certain class of ordinary differential equations with polynomial coefficients, see this post . We define auxiliary coefficients as follows: for , and subject to . We have shown that this multiple sum admits the following neat closed form expression below. We have derived the result by decomposing the product of Pochhammer symbols into linear combinations of single Pochhammer symbols  and then performing the sums bottom -up by using the Pascal triangle identity . Note: We coefficient at the highest  order term in are given below: where . Proof by induction: Fix and take the new factor in the term in the multiple sum and decompose that factor into a linear combination of upper Pochhammer symbols as follows: for integer . Now we in we replace and multiply both sides of it by . Then we have: Now we decompose the doubly underlined term by using repeatedly. We have: Now we do the sum over by using the identity . We have: Now we simplify. We firstly move the sum over to the very right (to the very bottom of the nested multiple sum) and then we substitute . This yields: Now we notice that the term in the last, single, sum is equal to the term in the double sum above it at . As such we absorb the last single sum  into the double sum above it at . Then we see that the right hand side of the equality above has the same functional form as the conjecture being evaluated at with the new coefficients being given by . This completes the proof.

17,Is my solution to count the integer solutions for a linear inequality with bounds correct?,Is my solution to count the integer solutions for a linear inequality with bounds correct?,,"I'm working on a problem where I need to count the number of integer solutions for the inequality $10 \leq x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 \leq 19$ , given that each $x_i$ (for $i = 1$ to $4$ ) is bounded by $-5 \leq x_i \leq 10$ . I approached the problem in two main steps, transforming the inequalities to work with non-negative integers by adjusting the bounds and then applying combinatorial reasoning. However, I'm unsure if my methodology and calculations are correct. Here's my approach: Step 1: Dealing with the upper bound First, I transformed the original inequality $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 \leq 19$ to a new form where I could deal with non-negative integers by introducing a new variable $B$ and adjusting the bounds of $x_i$ : $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + B = 19$ , with $-5 \leq x_i \leq 10$ Then, I adjusted the variables to work within a non-negative range, leading to: $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + B = 39$ , with $0 \leq x_i \leq 15$ , $B \geq 0$ From there, I calculated the total number of solutions without restrictions, subtracted the cases where one variable exceeds its bound, and added the cases where two variables exceed their bounds. The solution for step 1 was given by: $CR(5,39) - (CR(5, 39-16) \times 4) + (CR(5, 39-32) \times C(4,2))$ Step 2: Dealing with the lower bound Similarly, for the lower bound $10 \leq x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4$ , I considered cases where the sum is less than or equal to 9 (to subtract them from the total count): $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + B = 9$ , with $-5 \leq x_i \leq 10$ This was transformed to: $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + B = 29$ , with $0 \leq x_i \leq 15$ , $B \geq 0$ I then calculated the total number of solutions without restrictions for this case and subtracted the cases where one variable exceeds its bound. There were no cases for exceeding two variables. The solution for step 2 was: $CR(5, 29) - (CR(5, 29-16) \times 4)$ Final Solution: Combining the solutions from both steps, I derived the complete solution for the exercise as: $CR(5,39) - (CR(5, 39-16) \times 4) + (CR(5, 39-32) \times C(4,2)) - (CR(5, 29) - (CR(5, 29-16) \times 4))$ I'm seeking feedback on whether my approach and the steps I've taken are correct for solving this problem, particularly my use of combinatorial reasoning and the transformation of inequalities.

The solution for step 1 was given by: Step 2: Dealing with the lower bound Similarly, for the lower bound , I considered cases where the sum is less than or equal to 9 (to subtract them from the total count): , with This was transformed to: , with , I then calculated the total number of solutions without restrictions for this case and subtracted the cases where one variable exceeds its bound. There were no cases for exceeding two variables. The solution for step 2 was: Final Solution: Combining the solutions from both steps, I derived the complete solution for the exercise as: I'm seeking feedback on whether my approach and the steps I've taken are correct for solving this problem, particularly my use of combinatorial reasoning and the transformation of inequalities. Any insights into errors in my methodology or calculations would be greatly appreciated.","10 \leq x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 \leq 19 x_i i = 1 4 -5 \leq x_i \leq 10 x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 \leq 19 B x_i x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + B = 19 -5 \leq x_i \leq 10 x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + B = 39 0 \leq x_i \leq 15 B \geq 0 CR(5,39) - (CR(5, 39-16) \times 4) + (CR(5, 39-32) \times C(4,2)) 10 \leq x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + B = 9 -5 \leq x_i \leq 10 x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + B = 29 0 \leq x_i \leq 15 B \geq 0 CR(5, 29) - (CR(5, 29-16) \times 4) CR(5,39) - (CR(5, 39-16) \times 4) + (CR(5, 39-32) \times C(4,2)) - (CR(5, 29) - (CR(5, 29-16) \times 4))","['combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics', 'inclusion-exclusion']"

21,Definition of hypergraph homomorphism,Definition of hypergraph homomorphism,,"W.Dörfler and D.A.Waller's paper ""A category-theoretical approach to hypergraphs"" gives the following definitions: A hypergraph is a triple $H = (V,E,f)$ where $V$ is the set of vertices, $E$ is the set of (hyper)edges and $f \colon E \to \mathcal{P}(V) \smallsetminus \{\emptyset\}$ is the function associating with every edges its edges. A hypergraph homomorphism from $H_1 = (V_1, E_1, f_1)$ to $H_2 = (V_2, E_2, f_2)$ is a pair of functions $h = (h_V \colon V_1 \to V_2, \ h_E \colon E_1 \to E_2)$ such that $h_V(f_1(e)) = f_2(h_E(e))$ for all $e \in E_1$ (by abuse of notation, if $f\colon X \to Y$ and $X' \subseteq X$ , then I set $f(X') = \{f(x) \mid x \in X'\}$ ). Note that this definition of hypergraphs allows loops (an edge connecting only a vertex with itself) and multiple edges (the same set of vertices can be connected by several edges). My questions are the following. What happens if we relax the definition of hypergraph homomorphism by requiring only that $h_V(f_1(e)) \subseteq f_2(h_E(e))$ for all $e \in E_1$ ? Which is the intuitive reason why we do not have a hypergraph homomorphism if $h_V(f_1(e)) \not\supseteq f_2(h_E(e))$ for some $e \in E_1$ ? Has the relaxed definition any pathological consequence? The authors say that In the case of hypergraphs which are graphs [that is, the cardinality of $f(e)$ is $1$ or $2$ for all $e \in E$ ], we note that the above definition reduces to the usual one of graph homomorphism: $h$ sends vertices to vertices and edges to edges, thus preserving adjacency of vertices. Does it hold even in the more relaxed definition of hypergraph homomorphism? I can't visualize any bad or paradoxical consequence of the relaxed definition of hypergraph homomorphism. On the contrary, it seems to me that only with the relaxed definition it holds that the trivial injection of a sub-hypergraph is always a hypergraph morphism (I assume that a hypergraph $H_1 = (V_1, E_1, f_1)$ is a sub-hypergraph of a hypergraph $H_2 = (V_2, E_2, f_2)$ if $V_1 \subseteq V_2$ and $E_1 \subseteq E_2$ and $f_1(e) = f_2(e) \cap V_1$ for all $e \in E_1$ ).

For every contiguous pair of elements in the sequence, their distance must be 0; that is, they must be neighbors horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, and there is no limit or restriction for a path's length. Also, note that this path definition doesn't include those whose starting and ending points are in the first-last columns of the grid.","n\times n n' n^2-n' C(n^2, n')  n' n^2 n'","['combinatorics', 'matrices', 'discrete-mathematics', 'graph-theory', 'percolation']"

47,Finding all possible valid values of a set based on a list of rules.,Finding all possible valid values of a set based on a list of rules.,,"I'm working on a programming project and I stumbled into a bit of a problem. I think it's not an impossible problem, but I'm guessing it would involve some math. It would be amazing if anyone can either help me, or point me in the right direction so I can solve it myself. The project involves checking the validity of a structure. This is being done by checking if each variable is initialized. Lets say that I create a set up integers from 1 until k from the variables in the structure. These are the indices of the variables, so if there are $k$ variables in the structure then: $$K = \{1, 2, 3, \dots, k\}$$ When a variable is instantiated, it's index is added to the set $K'$ . I know the accent ' might not be the normal math notation, but I don't know what is. For the rest of the explanation: the accented sets are the actual instantiated variables, and the unaccented sets are all variables that can be instantiated, so: $$ K' \subseteq K $$ The goal is to check if $K'$ is valid, because if $K'$ is valid, then the structure is instantiated correctly. But there are some rules to this sets validity based on the kinds of the variables, which I'll explain. Each variable is one of three kinds: optional, mandatory, or grouped. They are treated differently based on their kind. Optional ( $O$ ): their presence in $K'$ is completely ignored. They're not important in this problem. The amount of optional variables is called $o$ Mandatory ( $M$ ): all indices from the mandatory variables need to be in $K'$ . This is still a pretty simple case. The amount of mandatory variables is called $m$ Grouped ( $G$ ): the variable is associated with one or more sets, each with their own ""rule"", or function. This is the part where I have a question about. The amount of grouped variables is called $g$ and the amount of groups is called $a$ In other words, lets say that we have two sets $O$ and $M$ , and a list of sets $G$ , where $$ K = O \cup M \cup (G_1 \cup G_2 \cup \dots \cup G_a) $$ $$ k = o + m + g $$ These sets are mutually exclusive from eachother, except between the sets in $G$ $$O \cap M = O \cap (G_1 \cup G_2 \cup \dots \cup G_a) = M \cap (G_1 \cup G_2 \cup \dots \cup G_a) = \emptyset$$ And the same rules apply to $K'$ , $G'$ , $M'$ and $O'$ If variable $n$ is in set $G_i$ AND it is initialized, then $n$ is in $G_i'$ , so $G_i' = G_i \cap K'$ . Checking the validity of the set $G_i'$ is done through checking its cardinality with an single associated function. There is one of three types of functions associated with each set in $G$ (or $G'$ ): at_least(x), at_most(x) and exact(x). For each of these functions you can assume that $0 < x < g$ . I.e. if variables 5, 7, 8 and 9 are in with $G_i$ , and variables 7 and 8 are in K', and the associated function to $G_i$ is at_least(3), then $G_i'$ is invalid. At least one more variable, either 5 or 9, needs to be initialized for $G_i'$ to be valid. The list of sets $G'$ is valid when all of its sets are valid. $K'$ is valid when both $M'$ and $G'$ are valid. I said that I already know how to deal with $M'$ , just check if all mandatory variables are initialized, check if $M' = M$ , or check if $|M'| = m$ . We can skip this part as well. Now I can tell my problem: I want to know every possible value of $K' \cap (M \cup O)$ where $K'$ is valid. In other words, I want every possible combination of indices where all groups are valid. Is there a way to not brute force it, and try all $2^g$ combinations? Also, how would I express this with a mathematical equation? I kinda fumbled my way through the explanation, hoping it was understandable.","I'm working on a programming project and I stumbled into a bit of a problem.

49,Proof of $e\leq3v-6$ for planar graphs without Euler's formula,Proof of  for planar graphs without Euler's formula,e\leq3v-6,"For a short talk for an audience not familiar with graph theory I want to give an informal proof that $e\leq3v-6$ holds in all planar graphs with $v>2$ and I don't want to use Euler's formula.  My plan is as follows: I'll informally introduce what a (simple, undirected) graph is. I'll then introduce planar graphs as ""can be drawn without edge crossings"". Finally, I'll introduce maximal planar as ""loses planarity if an edge is added"". Then I'll justify why maximal planar graphs consist of ""triangles"" - of cycle graphs $C_3$ that enclose faces of $G$ .  I think it's OK to do that visually. Now the main part of my proof.  We'll start with a given a drawing of a maximal planar graph $G$ without edge crossings - the ""original"".  We will use the following algorithm to copy this drawing which makes sure that the current (partial) copy is always a subgraph of $G$ consisting of triangles of the original which are enclosed by a closed cycle of edges. Start with one of the inner triangles of $G$ . As long as we're not finished, one of the edges of our construction is an outer edge of the current copy but an inner edge of the original.  It is thus part of a triangle $T$ we haven't copied yet. If we find such a triangle $T$ where the third vertex is missing, we add this vertex to our copy.  We will then also need to add the two edges connecting this vertex with the existing edge (which will now become an inner edge). If we can't find a triangle as described in the last step, we have an outer edge $E$ which needs to be connected to a vertex $V$ which is already a part of the current copy. $V$ must obviously be an outer vertex of the current copy.  We can also find $E$ and $V$ in such a way that $V$ is directly connected to one of the endpoints of $E$ .   (Otherwise, adding the missing edges between $E$ and $V$ would create a cycle graph with more than 3 vertices.)  That means we only have to add one edge. At the start of the algorithm, we have 3 outer vertices (and 3 outer edges).  At the end, we must again have 3 outer vertices (and 3 outer edges) as the result is maximal planar.  Each step of type 3 adds an outer vertex, each step of type 4 converts an outer vertex to an inner vertex.  (Alternatively, each type 3 step increases the number of outer edges by one, each type 4 step decreases it by one.)  We will thus need $n$ type 3 steps and the same amount $n$ of type 4 steps.  These add $3n$ edges and $n$ vertices to our initial triangle and so we end up with $e=3n+3$ edges and $v=n+3$ vertices, proving $e=3v-6$ . $e\leq3v-6$ for planar graphs is now a simple corollary. Are there any glaring holes in this proof that I have missed? Edit: I've added a picture to demonstrate the algorithm.  The starting triangle is blue.  Triangles added by step 3 are green, triangles added by step 4 are orange.","For a short talk for an audience not familiar with graph theory I want to give an informal proof that holds in all planar graphs with and I don't want to use Euler's formula.

Form a suitable equation or system of recursive equations and determine the general formula. MY SOLUTION: So, we have that: after $2$ there can be: $3, 5$ after $3$ there can be: $2, 5$ after $5$ there can be: $2, 3, 6$ after $6$ there can be: $2, 3, 5$ Therefore we can distinguish $2$ groups of digits: group $C = 2$ and $3$ group $B = 5$ and $6$ There are 2 possible movements between those: form a digit from group $C$ we go to a digit group $C$ and a digit group $B$ from a digit from group $B$ we go to $2$ digits from group $C$ and one digit from group $B$ Therefore I came up with an equations ( $c =$ number of sequences with digit from the group $C$ at the end, $b =$ number of sequences with digit from the group $B$ at the end): $c_n = 2b_{n-1} + c_{n-1}$ , $b_n = b_{n-1} + c_{n-1}$ Now I try to solve those to get $B$ : $c_n = 2b_{n-1} + c_{n-1} \implies c_n = b_{n-1} + b_n$ And from that: $b_n = b_{n-1} + b_{n-2} + b_{n-1} = 2b_{n-1} + b_{n-2}$ So, for $B$ : $$b_n = 2b_{n-1} + b_{n-2}$$ For $C$ : $c_n = 2b_{n-1} + c_{n-1} \implies b_{n-1} = \frac{1}{2}c_n - \frac{1}{2}c_{n-1}$ And from that: $b_n = b_{n-1} + c_{n-1} \implies b_n = \frac{1}{2}c_n - \frac{1}{2}c_{n-1} + c_{n-1} \implies b_n = \frac{1}{2}c_n + \frac{1}{2}c_{n-1}$ And from that: $c_n = 2(\frac{1}{2}c_{n-1} + \frac{1}{2}c_{n-2}) + c_{n-1} \implies c_n = c_{n-1} + c_{n-2} + c_{n-1} \implies c_n = 2c_{n-1} + c_{n-2}$ So, for $C$ : $$c_n = 2c_{n-1} + c_{n-2}$$ From that I get: $b_n = 2b_{n-1} + b_{n-2}$ $c_n = 2c_{n-1} + c_{n-2}$ By solving one of them I will effectively solve both.

Are the proofs sufficient? Would appreciate any feedback and criticisms. The relation $\star$ is defined on $\mathbb{R}-\{0\}$ by $x \star y$ iff $x y \geq 0 $ . Proof of reflexivity : For any non-zero real number $x \in \mathbb{R} - \{0\}$ , we have $x^2 \geq 0$ . Thus, $\star$ is reflexive. Proof of symmetry : Since real number multiplication is commutative, if $x, y \in \mathbb{R} - \{0\}$ and $x \star y$ satisfies $xy \geq 0$ , then the relation $y \star x$ , which is equivalent to $yx \geq 0$ , is symmetric. Proof of anti-symmetry : Anti-symmetry states that when $(x, y) \in \mathbb{R} - \{0\}$ and $(y, x) \in \mathbb{R} - \{0\}$ , then $x = y$ . However, due to the commutativity of multiplication, this property does not hold. For example, when we take $x = 1$ and $y = 2$ , the relation $x \star y$ implies $x \times y = 1 \times 2 = 2 = 2 \times 1 \geq 0$ . Nevertheless, it is evident that $2 \neq 1$ . Thus, the relation is not anti-symmetric. Proof of transitivity : When considering $(x, y) \in \mathbb{R} - {0}$ such that $xy \geq 0$ , it is necessary for both $x$ and $y$ to share the same sign. Similarly, for $(y, z) \in \mathbb{R} - {0}$ , $y$ and $z$ must have the same sign to satisfy $yz \geq 0$ .

Apparently, linear extensions are extensions of an ordered set such that the extension itself maintains the rules of the original set (if I phrase it correctly). I am trying to extend the such that it restricts which divisors are allowed to appear: Let be the number of arrangements of in which every divisor itself appears after all of its divisors, and only divisors may appear. . It's easy to see that for all . Following the above example, because of the following arrangements: . This count no longer depends solely on the prime signature.

60,PI Controller - Integral term is causing instability,PI Controller - Integral term is causing instability,,"I am simulating the height of the reservoir in a hydro power plant using Matlab, without Simulink. The radial gates of the power plant are used to control the height of the water in the reservoir. This is done by implementing a PI controller on the radial gates. First, I am trying to let things work with only one radial gate. The flow into the reservoir is chosen to be $$Q_{in} = 400 \,\,m^3/s. \qquad \qquad (1)$$ The output flow through a radial gate is given by $$Q_{out} = \frac{dV}{dt} = C_g(D) \cdot D \cdot L \cdot \sqrt{2\cdot g \cdot H_g} \qquad \qquad (2)$$ where $$H_g = H - \frac{D}{2} \qquad \qquad (3)$$ . Rewriting eq. (2) with respect to (3) gives $$Q_{out} = C_g(D) \cdot D \cdot L \cdot \sqrt{2g (H - \frac{D}{2})} \\ = C_g(D) \cdot D \cdot L \cdot \sqrt{g} \cdot \sqrt{2H-D}. \qquad \qquad (4)$$ Grouping all the constants as $C_1 = L \cdot \sqrt{g}$ gives $$Q_{out} = C_g(D) \cdot D \cdot C_1 \cdot \sqrt{2H-D} \qquad \qquad (5)$$ Eq. (5) includes following variables and constants: $C_g(D)$ is a function dependent on the gate opening $D$ . $D$ is the gate opening. It's interval is 0 - 8.7 meters. $C_1$ consists of $L$ which is the width of the gate and gravity $g$ . $H$ is the height of the reservoir, calculated from the edge of the lower part of the gate where $D = 0$ . Furthermore, I am using a PI controller to control the height $H$ . I am using a for-loop in Matlab to simulate this problem. The discrete PI controller I use is calculated as follows. The error in Matlab is calculated by $$error(1,i) = H(1,i) - H_d(1,i)$$ where $H$ is the height and $H_d$ is the reference value or the set point. The height of the reservoir should always be at $116 m$ above sea level. In the program, I subtract the lower edge of the radial gate, where $D = 0m$ , which is $H_{edge} = 110m$ , so the radial gate is placed very high above sea level. I also choose the initial height in the simulation to be $H_{initial} = 115.8 m$ , therefore, $$H(1,1) = H_{initial} - H_{edge} = 115.8 - 110 = 5.8m \\ H_d(1,1) = H_{d} - H_{edge} = 116 - 110 = 6m.$$ This gives an initial error of $error = -0.2m$ . Next thing I do is to calculate the $P$ and the $I$ terms: $$PI\_P(1,i) = k_p \cdot error(1,i) \\ PI\_I(1,i) = (\frac{k_i}{T_i}) \cdot (PI\_I(1,i-1) + 0.5 \cdot (error(1,i) + error(1,i-1))\cdot dt) - intWindup(1,i)$$ The integral term is actually calculated in the program as if i == 1         PI_I(1,i) = ((ki/Ti)*error(1,i)*dt) - intWindup(1,i);     else         PI_I(1,i) = ((ki/Ti)*(PI_I(1,i-1) + 0.5*(error(1,i) + error(1,i-1))*dt)) - intWindup(1,i);     end The controller output is then calculated as the sum of the two terms: $$ PI\_u(1,i) = PI\_P(1,i) + PI\_I(1,i) $$ Since the radial gate can only vary between 0m up to 8.7m, I used a integral windup method called ""backwards calculation"" so that the integrator will not ""windup"". This is shown in the image below: Next thing I do is calculate the saturation $$u\_sat(1,i)  = CheckSaturation(PI\_u(1,i),Dmax,Dmin)$$ The function I wrote is given below function u_sat = CheckSaturation(u,gateMax,gateMin) % Controller saturation check      if u >= gateMax         u_sat = gateMax;     elseif u <= gateMin         u_sat = gateMin;     else         u_sat = u;     end end After this, I calculate the integral windup as $$intWindup(1,i+1) = intWindupBackCalculation(PI\_u(1,i),u\_sat(1,i),k\_lim)$$ where $k\_lim = 1$ . The function I wrote is given by function val = intWindupBackCalculation(u,u_sat,k_lim)     diff = u - u_sat;     val = diff * k_lim; end Now finally, I update the model of the reservoir with the following code Cg1(1,i)     = Cg_D(D1(1,i),Dmin,Dmax);       % The physical system     Qout_gate1(1,i)  = Cg1(1,i) * C1 * D1(1,i) * sqrt(2*H(1,i) - D1(1,i));     Qout(1,i)        = Qout_gate1(1,i) + Qout_m;     H_dot(1,i)      = (1/A(1,i)) * (Qin(1,i) - Qout(1,i));     H(1,i+1)        = H(1,i) + 0.5 * (H_dot(1,i) + H_dot(1,i+1)) * dt; This is simply calculation of eq. (2) from above, $Qout\_m = 0$ is the flow through the machines which is excluded in the calculations. The differential equation used to calculate the change of height is $$ \dot H = \frac{1}{A} (Q_{in} - Q_{out}) $$ then in the last line of the code, I use discrete integral to calculate the height. My question starts now . Below is a plot where I choose $k_p = 40$ and $k_i = 0.1$ $H$ is the change of height per second $H_d$ is the desired height, or the reference level, 116m $D1$ is the radial gate opening in meters error is simply the error, the blue line, while the integral windup is the red line. it is also possible to see the proportional and integral gains in the legend. Qin is the red line and Qout is the blue line $PI\_P$ is the proportional term of the controller $PI\_I$ is the integral term of the controller In these figures above, it can be seen that the controller tries to keep the water height at 116m but there is this settling error, I think it's related to slowness of the integral term. It can also be seen that the radial gates opens up and it tries to regulate the water heigt. The error can be seen as very small related to the integral windup, but the error is there and it's not always zero. The flow in vs. flow out starts to be equal slowly. On the last figure, it can be clearly seen that the proportional term and the integral term is working. Now I choose $k_p = 40$ again, but the integral gain $k_i = 1$ In the figures above, the settling error is much smaller now and the response is much faster. The integrator is doing much more now, but not enough. I want the water level to be at 116m above sea level with only +/- 5cm. In real life, this system is very slow. The reservoir is huge, its area is $A = 3.8 \cdot 1000^2 \, \, m^2$ or $3.8 \,\, km^2$ . Now I want to increase the integral gain, and go above 1. So I choose $k_p = 40$ and $k_i = 2$ . In the figures above, it can clearly be seen that everything is very slow now which is not acceptable. Now I increase the integral term to $k_i = 5$ and everything goes unstable and crashes as you can see in the figures below. My question is: What can I do about this problem? Do you have any idea of what I'm doing wrong or what I could do better? The integrator is being a little bit of problem for me and I thing it's a bit strange that the system crashes.

The cells are the parts of the field, and in general, depending on a task, the cells can be united in a square or rectangle or in another geometric figure, for example, in a sequence of rectangles connected by their edges. For simplicity let us consider squired fields with dimension $n$ by $n$ . The cells of the fields in this puzzle are of two types: empty and filled. The empty ones are marked as white, the filled ones – as blue. The empty ones allow walking through themselves, and the filled ones doesn’t allow it, they are like a wall. The goal is to draw a chain of lines following one after another without lifting a pencil. The lines can only be drawn vertically and horizontally until an obstacle meeting. The obstacle will be a filled cell, or an edge of field, or a cell with already drawn a part of the line or lines. It needs to keep going straight until it has met an obstacle. At meeting an obstacle it needs to turn left or right. To start drawing is allowed from any empty cell to any of four directions (up, down, left or right). Let us take a look at the first example: The task is to find a route satisfying the above requirements. Looking over several variants, it can be found the following solution: It can be intuitively supposed that the solution is unique. On starting from another cell to draw a line without lifting a pencil, cells with gaps appear, for instance: Two cells have got empty – without lines. It does not satisfy the conditions above and therefore it cannot be accepted as a solution. Let’s take a look at the second example: This combination of empty and filled cells gives several solutions. Moreover they are presented in pairs: These variants are solutions even at placing the start instead of the finish and vice versa. It is a kind of a “commutativity” between a start and finish. The next ones are symmetric relative to 180 degree rotation. If you, reader, have been interested and attracted by this puzzle and have a wish to try to solve something of that on your own, then the following examples for this purpose: Enumerating intuitively variants at small sizes of fields (5-to-5 for instance), to find solution is not so hard. It is much harder if a size of field presents two, three, four (etc.) digit numbers. At a big size of field, it would effectively be to use an algorithm implemented in a computer program. An algorithm for enumerating variants can be organized in different ways. Hypothetically there can exist such a way that the algorithm organized on it would work more effectively (would be optimized in computational complexity). But it’s another question. I guess it’s much more interested among the community of mathematicians to look at this problem analytically and to try to understand at which conditions of combining empty and filled cells a solution exists. A lot of questions appear afterwards – uniqueness of the solution as well, and others – e.g.: symmetry, rotation. But I suppose that the question about the existence of a solution would be basic. For instance, the following combinations don’t have any solutions (and it is once again the intuitive suggestion): If it could be possible to map such a field into a graph then the graph theory could be applied to this problem and then I guess that the solution existence problem finding could be quite similar to the problem about “Seven Bridges of Königsberg”.

Consider an $m\times m$ grid with a 1 in the upper left corner and an n in the lower right corner that satisfies the following property. Let the entry in the ith row and jth column be $a_{ij}$ . Suppose the grid satisfies that for any entry $a_{ij}$ , any entry directly to the right of it is divisible by $a_{ij}$ and any entry directly below it is divisible by $a_{ij}$ . Find the number of possible ways to fill the entries of the grid. Now it easily follows from the problem's condition that if $a_{ij}$ is the entry at row i and column j, then every entry $a_{kl}$ with $i\leq k, l\leq j$ satisfies that $a_{ij} | a_{kl}.$ Let $D_{m,n}$ denote the desired entry of ways for an $m\times m$ grid satisfying the problem's conditions. Thus every entry in the grid is a divisor of $n$ . For a positive integer e and prime p, let $v_p(e)$ denote the highest exponent b of p such that $p^b $ divides e. Let $n=\prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{e_i}$ be the prime factorization of $n,$ where each $e_i\ge 1$ . Note that we may choose the highest exponents of a prime factor of n that divides each entry in the grid independently, so we have that $D_{m,n} = \prod_{i=1}^k D_{m,p_i^{e_i}}.$ Hence it suffices to consider the case when $n$ is a prime power, say $n=p^k, k\ge 0$ . If $n=1$ there is clearly only one way, so suppose otherwise. For $0\leq j\leq k$ , let $b_{i,j}$ denote the number of entries e in the $i$ th column such that $v_p(e) = j$ . Note that for fixed j, $b_{i,j}$ is a nondecreasing sequence of size m. Fact 1: The number of nondecreasing sequences of size k consisting of elements from a set of integers of size n is precisely ${n+k-1\choose k}.$ Note that we cannot have $(b_{1,j}, b_{2,j},\cdots, b_{m,j}) = (0,0,\cdots, 0)$ or $(k,k,\cdots, k)$ for any $j > 0$ , since the last column will always have $n,$ which is divisible by $p^j$ for any $0<j\leq k$ and the first column will always have 1, which is not divisible by $p^j$ . The case where $k=1$ is straightforward; we just have by fact 1 and the above observation that the answer is ${2m\choose m}-2$ (indeed once we have the sequence $(b_{1,1},\cdots, b_{m,1})$ we must place p's in the last $b_{i,1}$ spots of the ith column and 1's elsewhere, so each way to fill the grid's entries uniquely corresponds to a sequence of $b_{i,1}$ 's). So assume $k>1$ . It may help to exploit symmetry somehow. If $m$ is odd for instance, then it may be useful to consider $v_p(c)$ , where c is the entry in the center of the grid. Now the entries in the first row and first column are in increasing order of $v_p(e)$ . It's easy to count the number of possibilities for the first row, but the issue is that the entries in the second row depend on those in the first.

I am writing it because I found a mathematical problem that I found interesting enough to share with others. It seems to me that it is rather difficult and thus I rather not expect an answer. What is it about? Take any two irrational numbers (e.g., the canonical $e$ and $\pi$ ) and on both positive semi-diagonals of the coordinate system, instead of the natural numbers, start writing out their consecutive digits. This is how we label the axes. Then let's put a black square on the lattice points when its ""digital coordinates"" have a sum modulo $2$ equal to $1$ , and let's not give it when it is equal to $0$ . As you can see, the squares begin to cluster into larger groupings, and within these groupings into larger squares (as the picture below). The question is: What is the largest area of a square that can be obtained in this way in a ""grid of digits modulo"" for two specific irrational numbers? Of course, I can choose two artificial irrational numbers in such a way as to elevate the area of such squares to infinity (again, picture below), but putting two specific irrational numbers in it makes the whole problem quite interesting, because we have a predetermined ""grid of digits modulo"" that we can't change, and which doesn't seem to have such simple patterns of distribution of small squares (by the fact that we have irrational numbers). My intuition pushes me, in the direction of saying that such a maximum field will exist, although I could be wrong (due to the fact that the digits seem to behave randomly in this case, and over time you will come across larger and larger groupings of squares if you just wait long enough. Such a hypothesis. Then one could ask about the expected value of the area of a random square spanning maximally the local group, etc.).

Prove or disprove the converse (i.e. if for any path from $(0,0)$ to $(b,a)$ where each step involves going up or to the right one unit, all cyclic shifts of $P$ are distinct, $a$ and $b$ are coprime). I think distinct cyclic shifts can only be equal if in some sense, they're ""multiples of each other."" That is, if there's two repetitions of the same pattern.

I think one can prove that if a string has only two letters and each occurs an odd number of times, then no distinct cyclic shifts of the string are the same (distinct as in the shifts involve different indices of the string). To prove this, it would probably be useful to induct on the number of occurrences of the letter with the fewest occurrences, with the base case being one occurrence.
