0,Rotate a 2D subspace in 4 or more dimensions,Rotate a 2D subspace in 4 or more dimensions,,"Two non-co-linear vectors define a 2D subspace that passes through the origin. In 3D, you can represent a 2D subspace by its Normal.  It's very easy to define the angle between the two planes: $\theta = \cos^{-1}(N_1\cdot N_2)$ (assuming unit length) and it's a simple matter to find a new plane ""in between"" by interpolating to find a new normal: $N_t = \frac{\sin((1-t)\theta)}{\sin(\theta)}N_1 + \frac{\sin(t\theta)}{\sin(\theta)}N_2$.  Essentially, we're rotating the new Normal vector within the 2D sub-surface defined by the two original Normals. Rotating a vector this way extends easily into higher dimensions, but a Normal defines a hyper-plane, not a linear, 2D subspace.  So I can't use the same approach.  If I have two pairs of orthogonal vectors defining two distinct linear 2d subspaces, is there a way to measure the angle between them or find a new subspace that is an interpolation between the two? Edit: Working with the problem, I realized that even in 3D, interpolating the normals wouldn't be sufficient for my problem, but I would actually need to interpolate the space defined by the vector pairs.  It's still straightforward to do in 3D.  Referring to the image below, if I have vectors $X$ and $Y$ and wish to interpolate to $X'$ and $Y'$, it's simple if I find vectors $Z$ and $Z'$ by the cross-product approach.  Then we can find $F = \left[X\ Y\ Z\right]$ and $F'=\left[X'\ Y'\ Z'\right]$.  The rotation matrix making the full transform from $F$ to $F'$ would just be $F'F^T$.  From that rotation matrix, it's easy to extract the axis and angle of rotation and then simply interpolate through the angle. In higher dimensions, cross-product doesn't work.  However, we can still find a point in terms of the first frame of reference and project it into the second: $P(1) = \left[X'(X\cdot P(0) + Y'(Y\cdot P(0))\right]$.  Given any pair of $P(0)$ and $P(1)$, I can use spherical interpolation find a point on the shortest arc between the two points, but that's not what I need.  I need to interpolate the 2D space itself and find the corresponding point within the plane.  If I need to add any number of extra axes because there are multiple equally short paths, that's fine.","Two non-co-linear vectors define a 2D subspace that passes through the origin.

This seemingly generates a sequence of Pythagorean triples that I could not find used in any other formula.

These $1st$ terms are triplets with an even value of $a$ where $r$ increases by $2$ : $(8,15,17),(12,35,37),(16,63,65)...$ Note: We find this using $(8,15,17)$ as we have a recursive formula as well as the knowledge that $r = \frac{a + b - \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}2$ ,  which lets us find the side lengths of each Pythagorean triple.

I am trying to write a similar function $f(x)$ such that $$ \lim_{x \to 0}f(x) = \pi $$ Note that $f(x)$ is a function of levels. Level 1 is for 4 sides, level 2 is for 8 sides, then 16 sides, 32 sides and so on. Insofar: $$f(1) = 2\sqrt2 = 4 \sin 45$$ $$f(2) = 8 \sin22.5$$ $$...$$ I work out that $$f(x) = 2^x \sin\frac{180}{2^x}$$ When graphing that function: Given this, it doesn't seem to limit on the graph. Say, if it does limit to $\pi$, would it approximate $\pi$ for a relatively large $x$? Please note. There might be a lot of mistakes here.

The approach described by the author is to first solve for finding the center of gravity of a homogeneous triangle, then by analogy, use that to solve for the homogeneous tetrahedron. I understand the solution for the triangle, which is to find the intersection of all (3) of the triangle's medians.

Therefore, these six median planes must meet in one point which is precisely the center of gravity My problem is that I don't know how the author counted six median planes. In my opinion, the tetrahedron has 4 triangles (the faces) and each triangle has 3 medians, therefore the total median planes should be 12 and not 6.

On the solution to the tetrahedron part, the author states: In the case of the tetrahedron we have six median planes like MCD, joining the midpoint of some edge to the opposite edge, each of which has to contain the center of gravity of the tetrahedron. Therefore, these six median planes must meet in one point which is precisely the center of gravity My problem is that I don't know how the author counted six median planes. In my opinion, the tetrahedron has 4 triangles (the faces) and each triangle has 3 medians, therefore the total median planes should be 12 and not 6. I think there is some overlap between the 12 median planes I counted hence there is some double counting. I tried to draw each median plane on paper but was unsuccessful as it got messy quickly. What is a systematic way to count and visualize the 6 median planes in a homogeneous tetrahedron?",,['geometry']

I humbly thank you for helping a programmer in distress! ORIGINAL POST: Hi ::- D. I'm working on a (Flash) game and I have a weapon from which a projectile departs. The projectile travels along a line. I have the slope of the line as well as the origin (1 point). I want to calculate, depending on the Distance, where should I draw the projectile, frame by frame. The distance increases with a certain quantity each frame, as the projectile travels along the line. I have tried my best to solve this and this is what I did so far. I would not mind if you know a simpler way, but I would very much appreciate it if you would tell me why my method doesn't work (the coordinates I'm getting are very chaotic). I used these equations to build a system: http://www.analyzemath.com/Calculators/TwoPointsCalculator.html d = sqrt [ (x1 -x2)^ + (y1 - y2)^ ]  m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) I took out y2: y2 = m * x2 - m * x1 + y1 From that equation, I know everything except x2. x1, y1 and m are all known . I'm out to find x2 and y2 which are the coordinates of my desired point. I removed the radical by squaring the first equation and also breaking (solving) the paranthesis. I should mention it's been a very long time since I did any math so please excuse the lack of correct terminology. Also, I'm unfamiliar with how to produce a fast MathJaX of the equations, but I think they're simple enough to be written normally. ^ - means square. I used some extra paranthesis to clear it up. d^ = x1^ - (2 * x2 * x1) + x2^ + y1^ - (2 * y2 * y1) + y2 ^ Ok so I also know who d is. Now, I took y2 and substituted it in the above equation. This is what resulted: d^ = x1^ - 2 * x2 * x1  + x2^ + y1^ - 2 * y1 * (m * x2 + K) + (m * x2 +K) ^ Where K is that part which I can calculate from the above y2 equation: y2 = m* x2 -m * x1 + y1 So now I got an equation where I know everything except x2. I reduced this equation to a quadratic equation. The final form (I solved the squared parenthesis above as well) is: x2^ ( - 1 - m^) + x2 (2 * x1   + 2 *  y1 * m - 2 * m * K) + d^ - x1^ - y1^ + 2 * y1 * K - K ^ = 0 Looks scary doesn't it? laugh . This seems to be correct so far. Because we're talking about a line, slope and distance, it's obvious that there can be TWO points which are of distance D from my Origin (x1, y1). So I solve the quadratic equation in order to find x2-1 and x2-2 which I can then take to my first equation and get y2-1 and y2-2. So, I moved to solve the quadratic equation. First, I found a, b and c. a = -1 - m^ b = (2 * x1   + 2 *  y1 * m - 2 * m * K)  c = d^ -  x1^ - y1^  + 2 * y1 * K - K ^ And now, I found the 2 roots: x2 = (-b + sqrt (b^ - 4ac)) / 2a x2 = (-b - sqrt (b^ - 4ac)) / 2a Then, I found the two y2 points. And that's it ::- D. It doesn't work laugh ......... I worked for hours this morning, flexing whatever pathetic math muscles I got left and I worked all this far to end up with: (x=1509141.9643610462, y=20806970.245399687) This, in a case where the origin is at 200, 250 and the distance is 1 and the slope is 2.2 or -0.7 or whatever....... Sometimes, I even get NaN (that is, Not A Number, invalid value in ActionScript 3). So the values I'm getting are DEFINITELY not related to my origin. A point of interest however: for slope = 1.380657160570366, my projectile ACTUALLY SEEMS TO WORK , as in, it appears a bit TOO far from the Origin (about 50 pixels), but it DOES MOVE along the correct line, albeit, strangely, it ACCELERATES, even though I never increase its speed, I simply increase the distance: _ProjectileDistance += _ProjectileSpeed; var newCoords: Point = GetPointAlongLine(weaponRootPointX, weaponRootPointY, _ProjectileDistance, _ProjectileSlope); Projectile.x = newCoords.x; Projectile.y = newCoords.y; And for those who know programming as well, here is what all I said looks like in code: var a: Number = - 1 - slope * slope;   var b: Number = 2 * x1 + 2 * y1 * slope - 2 * slope * y2KnownPart;   var c: Number = distance*distance - x1*x1 - y1*y1 - 2 * y1 * y2KnownPart - y2KnownPart*y2KnownPart;    var x2Root1: Number = (- b + Math.sqrt(b*b - 4 * a * c)) / (2 * a);   var x2Root2: Number = (- b - Math.sqrt(b*b - 4 * a * c)) / (2 * a);   var y2Root1: Number = slope * x2Root1 + y2KnownPart;   var y2Root2: Number = slope * x2Root2 + y2KnownPart; Sorry for the long post ::- D.

83,Algebraic vs geometric approach different results confusion,Algebraic vs geometric approach different results confusion,,"I consider the following system: $$ x+y+z=A\\ x^2+y^2+z^2 = B $$ where $A,B ∈ ℝ; B ≥0$ . Now, the geometric approach here is that these describe a sphere and a plane. So they can: Have no intersection: the system would then have no solutions. Since we have a very specific plane and a sphere here, this might be impossible, but mentioning it just in case Be tangent: the system would then have exactly one solution. An example of that happening is $A=15, B=75$ Intersect via a circle: the system would then have infinitely many solutions and the set of solutions would form that circle. So far so good. Now, let's try algebraic approach and consider this ""trick"": let's multiply 1st equation by $2w$ where $w ∈ ℝ, w ≠ 0$ and then add it to the first equation. This yields $x^2+2wx+y^2+2wy+z^2+2wz=2Aw+B$ , or - after moving things around: $$(x+w)^2+(y+w)^2+(z+w)^2=3w^2+2Aw+B$$ And here's the thing: the $w$ we brought here was completely arbitrary. So we now try to make it so that the right hand side is 0, i.e. $3w^2+2Aw+B=0$ . And here's what I don't understand: This equation could have no roots. Since the leading coefficient is positive, this would mean that the sum of squares on the left hand side is always positive. So as far as I see it, it corresponds to ""infinitely many solutions"" of the geometric approach. This equation could have exactly one root. Then it's clear that it corresponds to a ""tangent case"" from the geometric approach. For instance, if $A=15, B=75$ we have $𝛥 = 0$ meaning it's exactly such case. This equation could have two roots. This is the case I do not understand . What does it correspond to? Furthermore, the algebraic approach doesn't seem to even work for the last case. For example, if we have $A=5, B=3$ then: $$ x+y+z=5\\ x^2+y^2+z^2 = 3 $$ And so $3w^2+10w+3$ , so $𝛥 = 64$ and $w_1=-\frac{1}{3}, w_2=-3$ . If we take $w=-3$ then it corresponds to equation $x^2-6x+y^2-6y+z^2-6z=3-(2∙3∙5)=-27 ⇒ (x-3)^2+(y-3)^2+(z-3)^2=0$ and there are several problems here: First, this implies $x=y=z=3$ because over reals the only way a sum of squares can add up to 0 is if all summands are 0 themselves. But $(3,3,3)$ doesn't satisfy the system Second, this isn't even unique because we could've used $w=-\frac{1}{3}$ Third and most important - this was done with only simple linear operations so the resulting equation is equivalent to the system. What do I miss with this last case when there are two solutions in $w$ ?

I have taken calculus up through advanced calculus, and a bunch of analysis courses. I don't ""get"" it though. Sure, I know the statement, but I don't know how to use it.  Here is an example. 2.47 Theorem. Suppose that $\Omega$ is an open set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $G: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ is a $C^1$ diffeomorphism. a. If $f$ is a Lebesgue measurable function on $G(\Omega)$ , then $f \circ G$ is Lebesgue measurable on $\Omega$ . If $f \geq 0$ or $f \in L^1(G(\Omega), m)$ , then $$ \int_{G(\Omega)} f(x) d x=\int_{\Omega} f \circ G(x)\left|\operatorname{det} D_x G\right| d x . $$ b. If $E \subset \Omega$ and $E \in \mathcal{L}^n$ , then $G(E) \in \mathcal{L}^n$ and $m(G(E))=\int_E\left|\operatorname{det} D_x G\right| d x$ . Proof. It suffices to consider Borel measurable functions and sets. Since $G$ and $G^{-1}$ are both continuous, there are no measurability problems in this case, and the general case follows as in the proof of Theorem $2.42$ . A bit of notation: For $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $T=\left(T_{i j}\right) \in G L(n, \mathbb{R})$ , we set $$ \|x\|=\max _{1 \leq j \leq n}\left|x_j\right|, \quad\|T\|=\max _{1 \leq i \leq n} \sum_{j=1}^n\left|T_{i j}\right| $$ We then have $\|T x\| \leq\|T\|\|x\|$ , and $\{x:\|x-a\| \leq h\}$ is the cube of side length $2 h$ centered at $a$ . Let $Q$ be a cube in $\Omega$ , say $Q=\{x:\|x-a\| \leq h\}$ . By the mean value theorem , $g_j(x)-g_j(a)=\sum_j\left(x_j-a_j\right)\left(\partial g / \partial x_j\right)(y)$ for some $y$ on the line segment joning $x$ and $a$ , so that for $x \in Q,\|G(x)-G(a)\| \leq h\left(\sup _{y \in Q}\left\|D_y G\right\|\right)$ . In other words, $G(Q)$ is contained in a cube of side length $\sup _{y \in Q}\left\|D_y G\right\|$ times that of $Q$ , so that by Theorem $2.44, m(G(Q)) \leq\left(\sup _{y \in Q}\left\|D_y G\right\|\right)^n m(Q)$ .

98,Generalized Regular Polygon Area Formula to Any Number of Sides,Generalized Regular Polygon Area Formula to Any Number of Sides,,"I was looking for a way to check if the regular polygon area formula of $\frac{ns^2}{4} \cot \frac{π}{n}$ where s is the side length and n is the number of sides could be extended to fractional  and irrational n. Setting s to be 1, we get the constant in exact form of the area of the polygon. This also gives the area of the unit polygon as well. I am assuming the area of the entire polygon not using the even-odd rule just like the Wolfram Alpha example. Let this area be called $A_n=\frac{n}{4}\cot\frac{π}{n}$ Testing n= $\frac{5}{2}$ , we see that the interior angle is θ= $\frac{4π}{5}$ . This creates the pentagram polygon with Schläfli Symbol of $\lbrace\frac{5}{2} \rbrace$ . When putting the formula into use, $A_\frac{5}{2}=\frac{5/2}{4}\cot\frac{π}{5/2}$ = $\frac{\sqrt{5}}{8}\sqrt{5-2\sqrt{5}}$ , but when searching in Wolfram Mathworld, the constant came out to be A(unit pentagram or area constant of pentagram)= $\frac{\sqrt{10}}{4}\sqrt{65-29\sqrt{5}}$ . Similarly, the area of a pentagon can be used in the formula to give $A_5=\frac{5}{4}\cot\frac{π}{5}$ = $\frac{\sqrt{5}}{4}\sqrt{5+2\sqrt{5}}$ , In addition, one interpretation of the number of sides can also be the perimeter as we are assuming the side length is $\frac{5}{2}$ meaning that each side has a length of $\frac{1}{2}$ or less which contradicts the assumption that we can only have one side. However, if we allow the side length to be one without any scaling of the sides as a result of the n-value, the formula still has the constant incorrect. Only when solving for the area of the $36^\circ-126^\circ-18^\circ$ triangle, do we get the value. After multiplying by $10$ , the number of triangles in the shape, we get the same value as in Wolfram Mathworld. This triangle is the triangle when the shape is radially divided into ten equal triangles. My question is what the restrictions are for the formula $A=A(n,s)=\frac{ns^2}{4}\cot \frac{π}{n}$ where n is the number of sides and s is the side length. It definitely works for $n\in\Bbb Z$ an integer assuming negative values of n would correspond to negative areas. If $n=0$ , the formula is undefined as well as for any values $n= \frac{1}{m}$ where $m\in\Bbb Z$ and the formula equals $0$ when n= $\frac{2}{2m+1}$ where $m\in\Bbb Z$ . My second question is if there are restrictions for this equation, what would be a general formula only in terms of $n$ and $s$ defined in the above paragraph? This means $n,s\in\Bbb R$ . How about for $n,s\in\Bbb C$ ? How about $n$ and $s$ in the set of all matrices with complex entries $\Bbb M$ ? It seems like for a regular complex polygon, the area would be in the form of A=2n* $\frac{1}{2}$ b h=n b h=n c*h where 2n is the amount of dividing triangles there are in the polygon, $\frac{1}{2}$ b h is the area of these triangles, and c is the circumradius being equal to the base, denoted by b, of each triangle. This premise assumes the regular complex polygon is “filled” so that the “star” outline was filled in completely without any self-intersections affecting the area definition. Going onto seedcode and setting the stator rotor (sr) to the number of sides and leaving only one rotor to be inside the stator rotor (sr) which is named rotor 1 (r1) to be the turning number will give a shape reminiscent of the shape with Schläfli of $$\left\{ \frac{p}{q}\right\}=\left\{ \frac{sr}{r1}\right\}=\left\{ \frac{\text{number  of sides}}{\text{turning number}}\right\}$$ Be sure to set the pen radius (r) in the app to be r1. In the app, r=r1. Thanks to @Blue for figuring out the formula for a “filled” star polygon in terms of the circumradius and Schläfli number $$\{N\}=\text{ratio}=\left\{\frac{p}{q}\right\}$$ . I also appreciate them for giving insight into the other convention. Going on the star polygon link below, gives the circumradius in terms of the ratio which then can be simplified to $\frac{1}{2} \csc\frac{π}{N}$ . This can be intuitively and geometrically understood by imagining the cosecant operator in the diagram in their post. However, this assumes a unit length and therefore “area constant”. Interestingly enough, substituting this value into their formula for r and multiplying by $s^2$ for s being the side length simplified down to: $$\text{Area}\left(\text{“filled” polygon with side length }s\text{ and Schläfli symbol }\{N\}=\left\{\frac a b\right\}\right)=A(a,b,s)=A_N (s)= \frac{a s^2\csc^2 \frac{π}{N}}{4(\cot\frac{π}{a}+\tan\frac{π}{N})}$$ . Testing the pentagram we get $$A_{5/2} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{4}\sqrt{65-29\sqrt{5}}=.31027…$$ after a few steps, the same value as in Wolfram Mathworld. Amazingly, when putting $$N=a=\frac a1 =\frac ab$$ we get $$A_N (s)=\frac {a s^2 }4 \cot \frac πa$$ which implies the cotangent formula assuming a “filled polygon” and b=1 can only have n as an integer and n not equal to 0. Even trying a pure imaginary number such as $\{N\}=\left\{\frac i2\right \} $ with side length $i$ experimentally gets: $$A_{\frac i2} (i)=\frac 14\tanh(\pi)\coth(2\pi)\text{csch}(2\pi)=\frac{e^{2\pi}(e^{4 \pi}+1)}{2(e^{2 \pi}+1)^3(e^{2 \pi}-1)}=.00093025…$$ after a few steps.
