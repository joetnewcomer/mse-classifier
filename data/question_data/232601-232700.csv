Following this intuition, call $\mathcal{C}_0$ the projection of $\mathcal{C}$ on the first coordinate, and $\mathcal{C}_1$ the projection on the second coordinate.

I am looking to find a proof by double counting. Logically concerning the left hand side I was thinking about the number of all subsets of a n-set.

This seems a bit counterintuitive as there are a lot of sets that will be counted double. I looked at the building up of the subsets from k to k+1 and tried finding a recurrence relation.

Here is my reasoning: If we assume each polynomial of positive degree k has at most $k \in \mathbb{Z}_+$ roots (we assume this without proof), then for each $p \in \mathbb{Q}[X]$ the set $P_0 = \{ x \in \mathbb{Q}\, |\, p(x) = 0 \}$ is countable (since the set is finite). If we let $\mathcal{P}$ be the collection of zero-sets, then the set of all zero-sets is $\bigcup_{P_0 \in \mathcal{P}} P_0$ . This is a countable union, since each zero set corresponds to a unique rational coefficient polynomial (the set of which is proven to be a countable set).

Suppose that $A=\{u,\{\{v,w\},x,\{y,\{z\}\}\}\}$ . The nesting of the sets allows you to uniquely identify particular elements by there ""depth"" in $A$ . For example $z$ is the only element $e\in^4A$ ( $\in^4$ is an abuse of notation meant to suggest that $e$ is an element of an element of an element of an element of $A$ ). However, this type of statement is not sufficient for uniquely identifying any element other than $z$ , as, for example, the set of all $e\in^2 A$ contains $\{v,w\}$ , $x$ , and $\{y,\{z\}\}$ . It is still possible to distinguish between each of these elements, though; $e\in^2A\ and\ |e|\neq2$ defines $x$ , $e\in^2A\ and\ \nexists\ b\in e:|b|=1$ defines $\{u,w\}$ , and $e\in^2A\ and\ \exists\ b\in e:|b|=1$ defines $\{y,\{z\}\}$ .

I am not a mathematician so I might not be entirely accurate in my mathematical depictions, but I will correct them if I can. My problem is like that: I have $f_n:\mathbb R ^+\to\mathbb R ^+$ with $f_{n}(x)=x_{m_{n}}$ For the moment I will explain the function using a $n=10$ as $n$ is the basis in which the number is written and ""processed"" by my function.

I think the sum goes from $-\infty$ to $\infty$ for any given number as the digits that are not written are zeros. So what my function does (or at least if think it does) is basically a mirroring of digits over the decimal point (ex.: $f(23.45)=54.32$).
