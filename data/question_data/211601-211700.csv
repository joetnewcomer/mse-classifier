3,Asymptotic of sum with binomial coefficients.,Asymptotic of sum with binomial coefficients.,,"Let $\displaystyle f(n,k) = \sum_{m \le k} \binom{n}{m}$ . We need to show $\displaystyle f(n,k) \sim \frac{2^{nH(k/n)}}{\sqrt{2\pi k(n-k)/n}}(1 + o(1))$ , where $k = o(n)$ and $k \to \infty$ Actually I've thought about three ideas : 1) Consider $\displaystyle \xi _{i}$ be Bernoulli random variables, and use CLT for estimating this sum. 2) Use Stirling approximation. 3) Use Abel summation. The former idea give the worst asymptotic. The second one isn't usable , because $m$ is just a constant for finitely many times. The last idea gives me : (1) = $\displaystyle \sum_{m \le k} \binom{n}{m} = \sum \frac{n!}{m!} \cdot \frac{1}{(n-m)!}$ , let $\displaystyle g(x) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(n-x)}$ and $a_m = n! / m!$ .

Any hint? Attempt (using CLT). Let $S_n = \sum X_i$ , where $X_i$ i.r.v with Bernoulli distribution and $p = 1/2$ . Hence we have $2^n \mathbb{P}( S_n \le k) = \sum ^{k} \binom{n}{m}$ .

13,"A distance over strings, and an embedding that perfectly captures it","A distance over strings, and an embedding that perfectly captures it",,"Suppose we have an alphabet $\Sigma$ . We also define a set of operations on a string $s=s_1 s_2 \dots s_n\in\Sigma^\star$ (assuming $c\in\Sigma, i\in[n]$ : $$swap(s,i)=s_1 \dots s_{i-1} s_{i+1}s_{i} s_{i+2} \dots s_n$$ $$ins(s,i,c) = s_1 s_2 \dots s_{i-1}\; c \;s_i \dots s_n$$ $$del(s,i) = s_1 s_2 \dots s_{i-1} s_{i+1} \dots s_n$$ Moreover the costs associated with each operation is defined as: $$C_{swap(s,i)} = 2, C_{ins(s,i,c)} = |s|, C_{del(s,i)} = |s|-1$$ Now if we denote the space of all possible actions by $\mathcal{A}$ , we define the distance between two strings as the minimum cost set of operations that transform one string to antoher: $$d(s,s')=\min_{a_i\in\mathcal{A}, a_k(\dots a_2(a_1(s))\dots) = s'} \sum_{i} C_{a_i}$$ It is easy to see that the distance is symmetric, as any operation can be reversed with the same cost: $s'=swap(s,i)\rightarrow s=swap(s',i)$ , $s'=ins(s,i,c) \rightarrow s=del(s',i)$ and $s'=del(s,i) \rightarrow s=ins(s',i,s_i)$ , while the cost remains the same. Therefore any minimum cost list of operations could be reversed to prove $d(s,s') = d(s',s)$ . However, I have a guess that the distances have a very simple formula which is as follows: For $s\in\Sigma^\star$ and arbitrary $a,b\in\Sigma$ we define $v_s$ as  the count of how many times letter $a$ appears before letter $b$ in the string $s$ . Or formally: $$v_s(a,b) = \#\{(i,j) \colon i<j, s_i=a, s_j=b\}$$ My guess is that: $$d(s,s') = \sum_{a,b\in\Sigma} |v_s(a,b)-v_{s'}(a,b)| \qquad (1)$$ If this is true, another way to view it is that we can embed strings into a $|\Sigma|^2$ dimensional space $s\in\Sigma^\star\rightarrow v_s\in \mathbb{N}^{|\Sigma|^2}$ , such that the $L_1$ distance in the embedding space corresponds exactly to the distance defined over strings: $d(s,s') = ||v_s - v_{s'}||_1$ (if we view $v_s,v_{s'}$ as vectors). It is easy to see that if we get $s'$ from $s$ by a single operation, the associated cost is captured by the equation (1). But in order to prove that for any set of optimal operations the equation holds some kind of induction must be used. But I am not sure how to construct such an induction.

Please take a look at my solution since this is my answer from the exam and I think to appeal on this question, I'd like to hear your thoughts if I can appeal this.

Let's split into two different cases: $*$ 1. $n$ is odd, therefore in this case we got: $2^{n-1}-a_{n-1}$ 2. $n$ is even, therefore in this case we got: $a_{n-1}$ $*$ EXPLANATION: $2^{n-1}$ is the number of subsets of { ${1,2,...,n}$ }. $a_{n-1}$ is the number of subsets of { ${1,2,...,n}$ } that have an even sum of their elements like I defined.  Therefore $2^{n-1}-a_{n-1}$ is the number of subsets of {1,2,...,n} that have an odd sum of their elements.

There is an interesting way for the children to choose the toys so that no two of them will choose the same toy.

The N toys are assigned to the bottoms of the vertical lines, and each child chooses as a starting point the top of a vertical line. From this starting point, the child will trace a path downward. However, whenever the child runs into a horizontal segment, he or she must turn horizontally, and then turn downward again when the adjacent vertical line is reached. For example, Fig.(b) shows the path that John follows. It is claimed that no matter how many horizontal segments are drawn, in whatever possible way, no two children will reach the same toy. Prove this claim by induction on the number of horizontal segments drawn. Image: What I have tried: Not much except I the obvious... Base case: For N vertical lines and horizontal segment h = 0, we have obvious  result that every child will get different toy.  Induction hypothesis: Assuming every child gets different toy for h = k segments.  Induction: Proof for h = k + 1 What I thought is that we could divide the N lines by half then each part of graph will have less than k+1 segments.

88,How many permutations do you need to force fixed points?,How many permutations do you need to force fixed points?,,"For simplicity let $k$ be given fixed, and $n$ grows large. We are interested in a small set $M_n={g_1,...,g_m}$ of permutations in $S_n$, s.t for all $a\in S_n$, there is $g_i \in M_n$ with $ag_i$ having at least $k$ fixed points. The question is how large must $M_n$ be asymptotically depending on $k,n$. Another interesting question after we solve this one, is what happens when we force $M_n$ to be a subgroup of $S_n$. If ones assums $n \geq (k+1)!$ there is the following upper bound which will be proved below after the lower bound) Upper bound: $m=O((k+1)!nlog(n))$. Note for $k=1$ we also have the clear upper bound of $n$ taking what's genereated by a large circle. A (sad) lower bound of $m=\theta ((k+1)!)$ also follows in similiar spirit to the upper bound. Here is also a lower bound of $\lfloor(n/2)\rfloor$ for $k=1$ (and in particular for the rest of the $k$): We start with the complete bipartite graph with both sides having $n$ elements, each perfect matching corresponds to a matching which says who the left guy goes to in the right. Each $g_i$ kills a set of edges (i.e if in our permutation that edge exists, then multiplying by $g_i$ would lead to a fixed point for the left guy). Thus what I claim that if you remove a union of any $\lfloor(n/2)\rfloor-1$ perfect matchings off the complete bipartite graph with $n$ vertices on each side, there is still a perfect matching standing. Note that it is possible to use $\lfloor(n/2)\rfloor$ matchings to cover so that we won't be able to find a perfect matching, so this is tight. Now if we could only use $\lfloor(n/2)\rfloor-1$, then let's see the set that kills Halls condition. Say it is the set $A$ of size $a$. Then it sees a set $B$ of size at most $a-1$. Clearly $a\leq \lfloor(n/2)\rfloor-1$, otherwise $A$ sees everyone after removing the matchings. So we managed to cover the complete bipartite graph $AxB^c$ with $\lfloor(n/2)\rfloor-1$ matchings exhausting $A$. But $B^c$ has size at least $n-(a-1)\geq n- \lfloor(n/2)\rfloor-1+1=n-\lfloor(n/2)\rfloor > \lfloor(n/2)\rfloor-1$, and so $A$ sees all of $B^c$ after removing our matchings,a contradiction. Here is an upper bound as promised and the other lower bound: We want a set of $m$ permutations $g_{1},..,g_{m}$, s.t for all permutations $a$, there is $g_{i}$ with $ag_{i}$ having at least $k$ fixed points. Given a fixed $a$, if we pick a random $g$, what is the probability $ag$ has at least $k$ fixed points? Well since choosing $g$ at random is like $a^{-1}g$ at random, we're asking what is the probability a random $g$ has at least $k$ fixed points. It turns out easier to count the other thing, how many permutations have at most $k-1$ fixed points? Well in paricular how many have exactly $s$ fixed points? That's like fixing the $s$ fixed points, and then picking a derangment (no fixed point) on the rest; number of derangments on $n$ elements is (this one by inclusion exclusion) $n!(\sum_{0}^{n}\frac{(-1)^{i}}{i!})$, for large $n$ this is $\sim\frac{n!}{e}$. Thus the number of those with exactly $s$ fixed points is like $\binom{n}{s}\frac{(n-s)!}{e}$. So the number with at most $k-1$ fixed points is: $\sum_{s=0}^{k-1}\binom{n}{s}\frac{(n-s)!}{e}$. Thus our desired probability is $1-\frac{\sum_{s=0}^{k-1}\binom{n}{s}\frac{(n-s)!}{e}}{n!}=1-\frac{1}{e}(\sum_{s=0}^{k-1}\frac{\binom{n}{s}}{n\cdot(n-1)..(n-s+1)})=1-\frac{1}{e}(\sum_{s=0}^{k-1}\frac{\frac{n(n-1)..(n-s+1)}{s!}}{n(n-1)..(n-s+1)})=1-\frac{1}{e}(\sum_{s=0}^{k-1}\frac{1}{s!})=\frac{\sum_{s=k}^{\infty}\frac{1}{s!}}{e}$, this by Taylor approximation is at least (and up to a constant exactly) $\frac{1}{e(k+1)!}$. At last we can get to our problem. We need to union bound over $n!$ guys, so we want $(1-\frac{1}{e(k+1)!})^{m}<\frac{1}{n!}$. If $m=e(k+1)!$ we get roughly $\frac{1}{e}$, so $e(k+1)!(nlogn)$ is what we want and tight (to get the union bound) up to a const. So our answer is that $m=(k+1)!(nlog(n))$ suffices. To get a lower bound we try to flip our heads as usual. Assume we have just $m$, and we take a random element, the probability m catches us is $\frac{1}{e(k+1)!}$, so the probability at least one of them catches us by union bound is at most $\frac{m}{e(k+1)!}$, so $m\geq(k+1)!$ is a bound.","For simplicity let $k$ be given fixed, and $n$ grows large.
