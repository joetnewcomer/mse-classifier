1,Baire category and relative topology,Baire category and relative topology,,"The present problem is realted to the following posting in MSE. Recall that for a given a topological space $(X,\tau)$ , a set $E\subset X$ is nowhere dense in $X$ if $\operatorname{Int}(\overline{E})=\emptyset$ . A subset of $X$ that can be written as a countable union of nowhere dense sets in $X$ is said to be a set of first category. The space $(X,\tau)$ is said to be of first category if $X$ , as a subset of itself, is set of first category. A set $A$ may be of first category in some space $(X,\tau)$ but not a subspace of first category. For example, $\mathbb{Z}\subset\mathbb{R}$ is a set of first category in $\mathbb{R}$ (the latter endowed with the usual Euclidean topology) but, $\mathbb{Z}$ as a subspace of $\mathbb{R}$ is not of first category, for the topology on $\mathbb{Z}$ inherited by that on $\mathbb{R}$ is the discrete topology in which every subset of $\mathbb{Z}$ is both open and closed. The question that I have is: Suppose $A$ is considered as a subspace of $X$ , that is $A$ is endowed with the topology $\tau_A$ described above. If $(A,\tau_A)$ is a space of first category, is $A$ a set of first category in $(X,\tau)$ ? At first this may appear as a problem of semantics, but I think it is more nuanced than that.

12,Is topology intrinsic or is it a construction?,Is topology intrinsic or is it a construction?,,"Given a set $M$ , we can construct a topology $\tau$ to this set, which is nothing but a collection of open sets, making it a topological space $(M,\tau)$ . There are many ways to do so. Continuity is defined based on the concept of open sets, i.e., a function $f:(M,\tau) \rightarrow (N,\tau')$ from one topological space to another is said to be continuous if and only if the preimage of each open set of $N$ is open. There is here something which is pretty awkward to me: the notion of continuity is not a property of the function itself, but depends on the topologies you choose for $M$ and $N$ . Since topologies change the continuous character of functions, this makes homeomorphisms from two different sets/manifolds not to be a intrinsic property between the two sets/manifolds, i.e., it depends on the topology you choose. For instance, pick $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with euclidian metric $|x| = \sqrt{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}^{2}}$ . We can construct a topology by choosing a basis with the n-balls $B(p;r) = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}; \, |x-p|<r\}$ . Let's call this topology $\tau$ . Now, let $\tau_{0}$ be the trivial topology for $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ , i.e., $\tau_{0} = \{\mathbb{R}^{n}, \varnothing \}$ . Let $f:(\mathbb{R}^{n},\tau_{0}) \rightarrow (\mathbb{R}^{n}, \tau)$ be given by $f(x)=x, \forall x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ . One can see that $f$ is not a homeomorphism since it is not continuous. Nonetheless, we know that surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ can be topologicaly identified in terms of its genus. I.e., We have a list of surfaces (sphere, torus, 2-torus, ..., n-torus,...) that make any other surface homeomorphic to one of them according to its genus. And genus is something intrinsic of the surface. Therefore the topology is intrinsic to the surface. Thus we have here a contradiction with the construction made above.

My naive assumption was that by a cone shaped neighbourhood, Hatcher was simply meaning that there existed some space $Y$ such that if the neighbourhood in question was $N_{\infty}$ , then $CY$ is homeomorphic to $N_{\infty}$ and if the homeomorphism is denoted $\phi$ and $p$ is the ""tip of the cone"", then $\phi(p) = \infty$ . But then it would appear to me that in the one-point compactification of $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{R}$ there definitely exists a cone-shaped neighbourhood of $\infty$ , specifically, one that is homeomorphic to the cone of $\mathbb{Z}$ .

26,Intuition for meagre sets,Intuition for meagre sets,,"So I'm putting together a presentation in topology on BCT and I have the following theorems: Let $D$ be the set of somewhere differentiable functions $[0,1] \to \mathbb R$ . Then $D$ is meagre in $C[0,1]$ . Let $f \colon [0,1] \to \mathbb R$ be a differentiable function with derivative $f'$ . Let $X$ be the set of points for which $f'$ is discontinuous. Then $X$ is meagre in $[0,1]$ . My temptation to rationalise these intuitively (as a taster in the introduction) as follows: Most continuous functions are nowhere differentiable. Derivatives are continuous at most points. This is based off my understanding that a set $A$ is meagre in $B$ if it is small relative to $B$ in a precise sense. But there are instances where a meagre set can be quite large (even of full measure), and I've been told that it's not really correct to say ""most"" in this context.

To see that for every $A, B, C\in K(X)$ , we have $d_h(A,C)\le d_h(A,B)+d_h(B,C)$ , we consider $\gamma_{A}:=\{x\colon d(x,A)=d_h(A,B)\}$ and $\gamma_{B}:=\{x\colon d(x,B)=d_h(B,C)\}$ . If $d_h(A,C)\le d_h(A,B)$ or $d_h(A,C)\le d_h(B,C)$ then we are through, otherwise we claim that $$d_h(B,C)\ge d_h(A,C)-d_h(A,B).$$ Suppose the converse, $\gamma_B$ would be completely lying in the interior of $\gamma_A$ . By the definition of $d_h(B,C)$ , $C$ would be lying in $ U_{d_{h}(B,C)}$ and in the interior of $$\gamma:=\{x\colon d(x,A)=d_h(B,C)+d_h(A,B)<d_h(A,C)\}.$$ Interchanging the roles played by $A$ and $C$ , we will have a contradiction with the definition of $d_h(A,C)$ . Hence $d_h$ is a metric. However, I got stuck in proving completeness. Suppose we have a sequence $\{C_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ with $C_n\in  K(X)$ and $d_h(C_n,C_m)\to 0$ as $n,m\to\infty$ , I failed to find out the limit set. I think it should be $$\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty\bigcup_{k=n}^\infty C_k$$ but I am not even sure whether it is compact or not. Any help here? Thank you!

For this problem, assume (The Generalized Jordan Curve Theorem) If $A\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is homeomorphic to $S^{n-1},$ then $\mathbb{R}^n-A$ has $2$ components, and $A$ is the boundary of each.

Let $B$ be a closed ball containing $A.$ Then $\mathbb{R}^n-B\subset \mathbb{R}^n-A$ is connected and clearly unbounded.

I.e each $K_i$ is a compact Hausdorff space and each $\varphi_i:K_i\to K_i$ is continuous. For each $i\leq j\in I$ let $\pi_{ij}:K_j\to K_i$ be a continuous homomorphism of dynamical systems. That is $\pi_{ij}\circ\varphi_j=\varphi_i\circ\pi_{ij}$ . Furthermore suppose that $\pi_{ii}=\operatorname{id}$ and $\pi_{ij}\circ\pi_{jk}=\pi_{ik}$ for all $i\leq j\leq k$ . We know that the inverse (or projective I believe) limit of this system exists. Explicitly $\varprojlim_{i\in I}(K_i,\varphi_i)=(K,\varphi)$ where $$K:=\left\{(x_i)\in\prod_{i\in I}K_i:\pi_{ij}x_j=x_i~\text{for all}~ i\leq j\right\}$$ and $\varphi=(\varphi_i)_{i\in I}:K\to K$ is defined in the natural way. It is not too difficult to show that $(K,\varphi)$ is a topological dynamical system on a compact space (equipping $K$ with the subspace topology of the product topology.) For any compact Hausdorff space $X$ let us denote $M(X)$ to be the set of all finite valued complex Baire measures on $X$ , and we know that these measures are regular. In particular we can define $M^1(X)$ to be the space of all Baire probability measures on $X$ . We also know if $\phi:X\to X$ is continuous then the space of $\phi$ invariant Baire probability measures on $X$ , $M^1_\phi(X)$ is nonempty. By the Riesz Representation theorem we can identify $M(X)$ with the dual of $C(K)$ , and by Banach Alaoglu we can deduce that $M_\phi^1(X)$ is weak* compact. In particular that means that we can define $M^1_\varphi(K)$ and $M^1_{\varphi_i}(K_i)$ for all $i\in I$ to be compact topological spaces, and if we consider the pushforwards $\pi_{ij*}$ for $i\leq j$ we have another inverse system $(M_{\varphi_i}^1(K_i),\pi_{ij*})$ of compact spaces, so can construct $\varprojlim_{i\in I}M_{\varphi_i}^1(K_i)$ . A nice (but I think tricky) exercise in Operator Theoretic Aspects of Ergodic Theory by Eisner et al. is to show that $M^1_\varphi(K)$ is affinely homeomorphic to $\varprojlim_{i\in I}M_{\varphi_i}^1(K_i)$ by the map $\Phi:M^1_\varphi(K)\to\varprojlim_{i\in I}M_{\varphi_i}^1(K_i)$ given by $\mu\mapsto(\pi_{i*}\mu)$ where $\pi_i:K\to K_i$ is the standard projection. I am stuck trying to prove bijectivity. My idea is to use the Kolmogorov extension theorem to kill two birds with one stone, so to speak. Let $(\mu_i)_{i\in I}\in \varprojlim_{i\in I}M_{\varphi_i}^1(K_i)$ . As each measure is nice and regular we know there exists a unique measure on $\prod_{i\in I}K_i$ (equipped with the product $\sigma$ -algebra of the Baire $\sigma$ -algebras on each $K_i$ , which is actually just the Baire $\sigma$ -algebra on the product space) satisfying $\mu_i=P_{i*}\mu$ , where $P_i$ is the $i$ -th projection on the whole product space. As $K$ is compact it is Baire measurable, so this induces a measure $\mu_K$ on $K$ equipped with the trace $\sigma$ -algebra defined by $\mu_K(A)=\mu(A)/\mu(K)$ . There are two problems with this approach. Firstly I cannot see why $\mu(K)\neq 0$ , and secondly for $\pi_{i*}\mu_K=\mu_i$ we would need that $\mu_i(K_i\backslash P_i(K))=0$ for all $i\in I$ . This is my first time dealing with inverse limits, and I am struggling to see why this must be so. We could maybe use the fact that each $\pi_{ij*}$ is actually the adjoint of the Koopman operator $T_{\pi_{ji}}:C(K_i)\to C(K_j)$ and do some clever functional analysis argument, but I am unable to see it. In fact maybe the Kolmogorov Extension theorem is completely the wrong approach. Any pointers would be much appreciated.

This question may have been asked before, but after searching thoroughly, this is the only one to approach it in a certain manner with specific goals (taken from Stephen Abbott's Understanding Analysis). First, a crucial piece of terminology (for those who do not know it): ""Let $f$ be defined on $\Bbb{R}$, and let $\alpha>0$. The function $f$ is said to be $\alpha$-continuous at $x\in{\Bbb{R}}$ if there exists a $\delta>0$ such that for all $y,z\in{V_\delta{(x)}}$ it follows that $|f(y)-f(z)|<\alpha$.

Now, I have proved the first sentence of point 4 myself, however, the bit where I run into trouble is how to show that this guarantees that $D_f=\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}D_{1/n}$. My idea was that this is true because continuity and $\alpha$-continuity are equivalent, so we simply take the union over all $\alpha$, and by point 2, the only $\alpha$ that 'matter' are those infinitesimally close to 0, and so as (1/n) converges to 0, all possible $\alpha$ infinitesimally close to 0 are 'covered'. This is a very loose argument that I would like to make formal, however, this only allows for $\alpha$ of the form $1/n$ even though $\alpha$ can be an irrational number...
