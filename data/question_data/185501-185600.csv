4,Example of injective function with $f'(x) = 0$ for some $x \in \mathbb{R}$,Example of injective function with  for some,f'(x) = 0 x \in \mathbb{R},"So in my set theory class today my professor was discussing injectivity and we had an in-class exercise to show that any function, given that $f'(x) \neq 0$, is injective. This was easy enough as one can imagine such a function never switches from increasing to decreasing or decreasing to increasing, i.e., it's slope never switches sign and thus it's always increasing or decreasing and thus is quite easy to show satisfies the definition of an injective function. He then asked us to think about a function that is injective but also has $f'(x) = 0$ for some $x \in \Bbb{R}$. I was originally thinking constant function (due to the $f'(x) = 0$) but that's obviously not going to work (as it's like the opposite of injectivity -- every element of the domain maps to one element of the codomain). I can't quite think of a function which would satisfy injectivity but also have a point, $x$, where it's slope is zero. I'm interested to see what people can come up with!","So in my set theory class today my professor was discussing injectivity and we had an in-class exercise to show that any function, given that $f'(x) \neq 0$, is injective.

Let $f$ be a smooth function. Suppose that $F(x)=f(x^{\frac{1}{3}})$. Show that $F$ is smooth if and only if $f^{n}(0)=0$ for all $n \ne 3k$, where $n,k \in \mathbb{N}$. Solution: ($\implies$) Since $F$ is smooth, differentiating once gives $$F'(x)=f'(x^{\frac{1}{3}})\frac{1}{3}x^{-\frac{2}{3}}$$which is same as $$3x^{\frac{2}{3}}F'(x)=f'(x^{\frac{1}{3}})$$ Taking limit as $x \to 0$ on both sides we get $f'(0)=0$. Now differentiating the equation again and multiplying through out by $3x^{\frac{2}{3}}$ we get $$6x^{\frac{1}{3}}F'(x)+9x^{\frac{4}{3}}F''(x)=f''(x^{\frac{1}{3}})$$ Now taking the limit as $x \to 0$ on both sides we get $f''(0)=0$. Differentiating again we get $$ 54xF''(x)+27x^2F'''(x)+6F'(x)=f'''(x^{\frac{1}{3}})$$ Taking limit as $x \to 0$ on both sides we get $F'(0)=\frac{f'''(0)}{6}$, which is as expected.

Now I am unable to find any particular relation which can be exploited in the induction hypothesis. $(\impliedby)$ Now suppose that $f^{n}(0)=0$ for all $n \ne 3k$. The first thing that comes to my mind is L'Hospital's rule. So I start with it. The only point which needs to be checked at is $0$. Then for $x \ne 0$, we have $$F'(x)=f'(x^{\frac{1}{3}})\frac{1}{3}x^{-\frac{2}{3}}=\frac{1}{3}\frac{f'(x^{\frac{1}{3}})}{x^{\frac{2}{3}}}$$Thus, $$\lim_{x \to 0}F'(x)=\lim_{x \to 0}\frac{f''(x^{\frac{1}{3}})x^{-\frac{2}{3}}}{6x^{-\frac{1}{3}}}=\lim_{x \to 0}\frac{f''(x^{\frac{1}{3}})}{6x^{\frac{1}{3}}}=\frac{f'''(0)}{6}$$ Hence $F'(x)$ is continuous at $x=0$.

30,Interpretation of definitions and logical implication in Calculus - e.g. monotonic strictly increasing function,Interpretation of definitions and logical implication in Calculus - e.g. monotonic strictly increasing function,,"I read definitions in Calculus books that often confuse me from a logical perspective. For example, the definition of a monotonic function, e.g. a strictly increasing function, is defined as follows. $$ \forall x_1, x_2 \in A ~~~ x_1 < x_2 \Rightarrow f(x_1) < f(x_2) \tag{1}\label{1} $$ Now let's try to forget the intuitive knowledge of a strictly increasing function. This definition should pinpoint a class of functions that are OK and a class of functions that are KO. The functions that are OK are the ones for which the property \eqref{1} is TRUE for every $(x_1, x_2)$ couple in $A$. I've circled the TRUE cases in the attached truth table (only the $\Rightarrow$ part for now; 1) 2) 3) 4) and a) b) c) d) are labels). I've been schematic and tried to represent each possible case in the following graphs (the KO cases are marked with an X). The cases that puzzle me are the ones marked with question marks. For example, the $\delta)$ case is an allowed case since the property $\eqref{1}$ is TRUE. In fact, $x_1 < x_2$ is false and $f(x_1) < f(x_2)$ is true, giving us TRUE for $\Rightarrow$. This is counterintuitive and either is $\eqref{1}$ or my logic wrong. Another allowed case is $\theta)$, for which $x_1 < x_2$ is false and $f(x_1) < f(x_2)$ is false (in fact $f(x_1)=f(x_2)$) so $\Rightarrow$ is TRUE.

46,Integral of $\frac{1}{x^2+4}$ Different approach,Integral of  Different approach,\frac{1}{x^2+4},"underneath is a brief method of partial fractions integration on the problem given in the title Using a standard trigonometric result it is known that: $$ \int \frac{1}{x^2+4}dx=\frac{1}{2}\tan^{-1}(\frac{x}{2})+C$$ But also: $$\frac{1}{x^2+4}=\frac{A}{x+2i}+\frac{B}{x-2i}$$ Hence using partial fractions, $$1=A(x-2i)+B(x+2i)$$ Let $x=2i$  $$\therefore 1=4Bi$$ $$\text{Hence } B=\frac{-i}{4}$$ Let $x=-2i$  $$\therefore 1=-4Ai$$ $$\text{Hence } A=\frac{i}{4}$$ Hence, $$\frac{1}{x^2+4}=\frac{i}{4(x+2i)}-\frac{i}{4(x-2i)}$$ Or, $$\frac{1}{x^2+4}=\frac{i}{4}(\frac{1}{x+2i}-\frac{i}{x-2i})$$ Hence, it is quite easy to see that: \begin{align*} \int \frac{1}{x^2+4}dx &=\int \frac{i}{4}(\frac{1}{x+2i}-\frac{1}{x-2i}) dx\\ &=\frac{i}{4}\int \frac{1}{x+2i}-\frac{1}{x-2i} dx\\ &=\frac{i}{4}(\log(x+2i)-\log(x-2i))+C\\ \end{align*} We know that the principal value of log of a complex number can be calculated by the following formula: $$\log(x+yi)=\log(x^2+y^2)+arg(x+yi)$$ Hence, \begin{align*} \int \frac{1}{x^2+4}dx &=\frac{i}{4}(\log(x+2i)-\log(x-2i))+C\\ &=\frac{i}{4}(\log(x^2+4)+\arg(x+2i)-\log(x^2+4)-\arg(x-2i)+C\\ &=\frac{i}{4}(\arg(x+2i)-\arg(x-2i))+C\\ \end{align*} Now, consider cases. If x is bigger than 0, the argument of a complex number is always defined as $\arg(x+yi)=\tan^{-1}(\frac{y}{x})$ So our integral becomes $$\int \frac{1}{x^2+4}dx=\frac{i}{4}(\tan^{-1}(\frac{2}{x})-\tan^{-1}(\frac{-2}{x}))+C$$ And since arctan is an odd function \begin{align*} \int \frac{1}{x^2+4}dx&=\frac{i}{4}(2\tan^{-1}(\frac{2}{x}))+C\\&=\frac{i}{2}\tan^{-1}(\frac{2}{x})+C\\ \end{align*} Now, if $x$ is less than $0$ and $y$ is less than $0$ then argument of a complex number becomes $\tan^{-1}(\frac{y}{x})-\pi$ and if $x$ is less than $0$ and $y$ is more than $0$ the argument becomes $\tan^{-1}(\frac{y}{x})+\pi$ Also as in a previous case becasue arctan is an odd function, the integral becomes \begin{align*} \int \frac{1}{x^2+4}dx&=\frac{i}{4}(\tan^{-1}(\frac{2}{x})-\tan^{-1}(\frac{-2}{x})+2\pi)+C\\ &=\frac{i}{4}(2\tan^{-1}(\frac{2}{x})+2\pi)+C\\ &=\frac{i}{2}\tan^{-1}(\frac{2}{x})+D \end{align*} Hence $$\int \frac{1}{x^2+4}dx=\frac{i}{2}(\tan^{-1}\frac{2}{x}), x\in\mathbb R\ \land x\neq0$$ Now, obviously, it is not the same, as the trig identity, it has a pole at x=0 while the original integral doesn't and most importantly it is not a real number. This was done by me purely for recreational purposes but now it frustrates me. Can it be done this way? Did I basically did a mistake or maybe I missed something crucial?. thanks in advance. EDIT After using the correct definition of principal value of log and nice property about arctan (both given to me by you guys) we know that $$\log(x+yi)=\frac{1}{2}\log(x^2+y^2)+i\arg(x+yi)$$ and hence *** becomes  $$\frac{i}{4}(i(\arg(x+2i)-\arg(x-2i)))$$ =$$\frac{-1}{4}((\arg(x+2i)-\arg(x-2i)))$$ So the answe becomes  $$\int \frac{1}{x^2+4}dx=\frac{-1}{2}\tan^{-1}(\frac{2}{x})+D$$ And since $$\tan^{-1}(\frac{2}{x})=\frac{\pi}{2}-\tan^{-1}(\frac{x}{2})$$ the result is $$\int \frac{1}{x^2+4}dx=\frac{-1}{2}(\frac{\pi}{2}-\tan^{-1}(\frac{x}{2}))+D$$ OR$$\int \frac{1}{x^2+4}dx=\frac{1}{2}\tan^{-1}(\frac{x}{2})+E$$ as required Thanks :)","underneath is a brief method of partial fractions integration on the problem given in the title Using a standard trigonometric result it is known that: $$ \int \frac{1}{x^2+4}dx=\frac{1}{2}\tan^{-1}(\frac{x}{2})+C$$ But also: $$\frac{1}{x^2+4}=\frac{A}{x+2i}+\frac{B}{x-2i}$$ Hence using partial fractions, $$1=A(x-2i)+B(x+2i)$$ Let $x=2i$  $$\therefore 1=4Bi$$ $$\text{Hence } B=\frac{-i}{4}$$ Let $x=-2i$  $$\therefore 1=-4Ai$$ $$\text{Hence } A=\frac{i}{4}$$ Hence, $$\frac{1}{x^2+4}=\frac{i}{4(x+2i)}-\frac{i}{4(x-2i)}$$ Or, $$\frac{1}{x^2+4}=\frac{i}{4}(\frac{1}{x+2i}-\frac{i}{x-2i})$$ Hence, it is quite easy to see that: \begin{align*} \int \frac{1}{x^2+4}dx &=\int \frac{i}{4}(\frac{1}{x+2i}-\frac{1}{x-2i}) dx\\ &=\frac{i}{4}\int \frac{1}{x+2i}-\frac{1}{x-2i} dx\\ &=\frac{i}{4}(\log(x+2i)-\log(x-2i))+C\\ \end{align*} We know that the principal value of log of a complex number can be calculated by the following formula: $$\log(x+yi)=\log(x^2+y^2)+arg(x+yi)$$ Hence, \begin{align*} \int \frac{1}{x^2+4}dx &=\frac{i}{4}(\log(x+2i)-\log(x-2i))+C\\ &=\frac{i}{4}(\log(x^2+4)+\arg(x+2i)-\log(x^2+4)-\arg(x-2i)+C\\ &=\frac{i}{4}(\arg(x+2i)-\arg(x-2i))+C\\ \end{align*} Now, consider cases.

What I did is I have ""simplified"" the function first (don't know if there's a term for it?).  here's what I did so far: 1: $f(x)=\sqrt{x^2-6x+9}-\sqrt{x^2+6x+9}$ 2: $f(x)=\sqrt{{(x-3)}^2}-\sqrt{{(x+3)}^2}$ <- factored quadratics basically 3: $f(x)=\lvert(x-3)\rvert-\lvert(x+3)\rvert$ <- cancelled out sqrts with ^2 exponents but how would I proceed now with given tasks?

I need a function that satisfies the following condition: First condition $$ f(x, y) = f(x^{-1}, y^{-1})^{-1} \tag{1} $$ Well, I know that $f=\times$ or $f=\div$, e.g., can satisfies it. For example: if $f=\times$ and if $x = 5$ and $y = 8$ then: $$ f(x, y) = f(x^{-1}, y^{-1})^{-1} = 40 $$ But I have an extra condition, which makes it difficult: Second condition The result of $f(x, y)$ should be aprox. the simple average between them. I.e.: $$ f(x, y) \approx average(x, y) \tag{2} $$ Example: if $x = 5$ and $y = 8$ then $f(x, y) \approx 6+\frac{1}{2}$ Or, at least something between $x$ and $y$, i.e.: $$ min(x, y) < f(x, y) < max(x, y) \tag{2} $$ So, because of that second condition, I can now discard $f=\times$ and $f=\div$. $average$ itself does not work as well: For example: if $f=average$ and if $x = 5$ and $y = 8$ then: $$ average(x, y) = 6+\frac{1}{2} $$ $$ average(x^{-1}, y^{-1})^{-1} = 6+\frac{2}{13} $$ so $$ average(x, y) \neq average(x^{-1}, y^{-1})^{-1} $$ I have no idea how to solve it the right way, so I did some trial and error. The best I got was this: $$ f = average\left(average(x, y), average(x^{-1}, y^{-1})^{-1} \right) $$ The distance between $f(x, y)$ and $f(x^{-1}, y^{-1})^{-1}$ is lower than if I use the $average$, but it is not zero yet. Also, it works fine to small numbers like $5$ and $8$, but if I try $x=123$ and $y=888$ e.g., it starts to get too far from the average, although satisfying the condition $min(x, y) < f(x, y) < max(x, y)$, what is fair for me in last case. In Scheme language (R5RS) this following function should return #t for any rational number $x > 0$ and $y > 0$ given the right fn I am looking for: (define satisfies (lambda (fn x y)              (and (= (fn x y)                      (/ 1 (fn (/ 1 x)                               (/ 1 y))))                   (= (fn x y) (fn y x))                   (> (fn x y) (min x y))                   (< (fn x y) (max x y))))) Is it possible to solve something like that? Is that too specific? Where should I start? Thank you. ** LATE EDIT ** Third condition $$ f(x, y) = f(y, x) \tag{3} $$ Fourth condition (nice to have) $$ f(x, y) \in \mathbb{Q}  \tag{4} $$ Known facts $x \approx y$ $x \in \mathbb{Q}$ $y \in \mathbb{Q}$ $x > 0$ $y > 0$ My final solution Thanks to @DanielV and @Macavity: $$ f(x, y) = \mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{xy}) \tag{a} $$ $$ f(x, y) = \mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{x^{-1}y^{-1}})^{-1} \tag{b} $$ if $min(x, y) < min(x^{-1}, y^{-1})$ then use $(a)$ else $(b)$ Assume in this solution: $\sqrt{n}$ is a grotesque approximation $\in \mathbb{R}$ of the real root. $\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{Q}(x)$ is a function that converts a $\mathbb{R}$ number into $\mathbb{Q}$ number (losing precision, of course).
