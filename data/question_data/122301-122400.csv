I am aware that the rule for collinearity of three points $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), (x_3, y_3)$ is - $x_1(y_2- y_3 ) + x_2(y_3 - y_1 ) + x_3(y_1 - y_2 ) = 0$ OR $(x_2 - x_1) : (x_3 - x_2)  =  (y_2 - y_1) : (y_3 - y_2)$ But I cannot factor out the term $(a+b+c)$ when I apply either of these rules to the points $(a, a^3), (b, b^3), and (c, c^3)$.

69,Tangent to two disks: Roots of a 4th-degree polynomial?,Tangent to two disks: Roots of a 4th-degree polynomial?,,"Suppose you would like to find the two tangent lines that support two given disks in the plane to the same side.  Parameterizing the circles using $( \cos \theta, \sin \theta )$, I find that ultimately I am computing the roots of a 4th-degree polynomial in $x = \cos \theta$ (two of whose roots are imaginary, and two real). But I may not have formalized this in the most perspicacious manner. Rather than detail my approach, let me just pose the general question of whether there is a way to compute the tangent lines without effectively finding the roots of a 4th-degree polynomial. With two solutions one might hope for a 2nd-degree polynomial. Addendum . I should have made clear that what I need are the coordinates of the two points of tangency for two circles arbitrarily placed in the plane.  Nevertheless, both Ross's and Moron's solutions can answer this version of the question as well.  With appropriate translation, scaling, and rotation, I can place the two circles so that one is a unit-radius circle centered on the origin, and the other has $r \ge 1$ with its center on the $+x$ axis.  Then I am in the situation Moron drew. Knowing the side lengths of the triangles yields $\sin \theta$ where $\theta$ is the angle of the triangle on the $x$-axis, and from that I can compute the coordinates of the points of tangencies in terms of $\sin \theta$ and $\cos \theta$.  Much simpler than my brute-force calculation. Thanks!","Suppose you would like to find the two tangent lines that support two given disks in the plane to the same side.

What formula applies here? Assume faces can be curved in the same way that lines can be curved in a graph. Imagine a soccer ball with a hole that cut out one polygon—in the same way, what I’m imagining doesn’t require the edges formed by the vertices of this soccer ball to all form faces. I was reading about Euler’s formula for planar graphs, wherein v-e+f=c+1 (the number of vertices minus the number of edges plus the number of faces equals the number of connected components plus one). However, the usage of faces doesn’t work here, because there are an infinite number of planes in $\Bbb R^3$ , and the part of Euler’s proof that uses the number of faces increasing when a region becomes bound in by points doesn’t work here. Since nonplanar graphs can be embedded in $\Bbb R^3$ , and the formula only applies to planar graphs, Euler’s formula can’t be the right first step. This would probably be defined by a hypergraph, but I don’t know much about them. Edit : Assume the new definition of “face” to be a set of three and only three edges. Any number of edges could technically be a face but only three are necessarily coplanar under shifts of the points. Faces with more edges can be subdivided into triangles. I realized earlier that if there exists an edge on the structure that has only one face connected to it, a volume is not enclosed by that structure. I found the contrapositive of this, namely, that a volume is enclosed if, for all edges in the structure, each edge has a greater-than-one number of faces connected to it. I also noticed that two volumes are enclosed (leaving three total when considering the “outside” region) when there exists an edge with three unique faces connected to it—assuming that the structure already satisfies the property of every edge having at least two unique faces connected to it. I don’t know how to prove this, but I can picture it. Edit : Two views about the number of edges a face should have: I know that an edge on a graph is allowed to curve, so perhaps faces on these edged-volumes I’ve defined should be able to as well. However, edges on regular graphs only ever connect two vertices, so faces on these volumes should probably be restricted to possessing the minimum number of edges that a face can have. Important Edit: Essentially, what I want to find is the simplest example of a set of surfaces connected at edges that cannot be embedded in a 3-dimensional Euclidean space without planes crossing.","Given a graph, along with a set describing which edges are connected to form faces, how could we determine whether it is embeddable in 3D Euclidean space, a.k.a ?

I think I didn't get any formula for the blue area or for the touch point. This is not a Mathematica stack exchange question actually. Mathematica was used just as a means to solve the problem. I am actually looking for a formula for the blue area (or for the X value of the touch point). I constructed a system of equations but solving by hand wasn't possible. Is there such formula, or do we have to use numeric approximations here? I think both answers here provide just a numeric approximation.","R x f(x) = g(x) f'(x) = g'(x) R f(x) = e^{-x^2} g(x) = R + \sqrt{x(2R-x)} g x x \in (R, 2R)","['calculus', 'geometry', 'systems-of-equations', 'area']"

Thanks to another post here , I was able to find the corners of a rotated square centred on 0,0. Now however, I need to be able to find the vertices of a regular pentagon where the length of each side and the rotation of the pentagon are variable. I was able to get basic equations for each coordinate, as follows (where L = side length): $c_1 = L\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{5}\right)$ $c_2 = L\cos\left(\frac \pi5\right)$ $s_1 = L\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{5}\right)$ $s_2 = L\sin\left(\frac{4\pi}{5}\right)$ $P_1 = (0, L)$ $P_2 = (s_1, c_1)$ $P_3 = (s_2, -c_2)$ $P_4 = (-s_2, -c_2)$ $P_5 = (-s_1, c_1)$ How would I factor in rotation of the pentagon into this?","I would like to preface this question by saying that I'm not the best at maths.
