So basically, I attempted this question as- There are 4 numbers and 3 places to put in the numbers: In the ones place, any 4 numbers can be put, so there are 4 choices in the ones place. Similarly for the tens and the hundreds place. So, the total choices are, by multiplication principle- $$4*4*4=64$$ And well and good, this was the answer. But what if I reversed the method? So I take some particular numbers, like $1,2,3$ and say that, well, $1$ can go in $3$ places, $2$ in $2$ places and $3$ in $1$ place, so by multiplication principle, there are $6$ ways of forming a $3$ -digit number with $1,2,3$ . But there are $4$ different numbers. So the number of $3$ -number combinations are- $(1,2,3)$ , $(1,2,4)$ , $(1,3,4)$ , $(2,3,4)$ . Each can be arranged in $6$ ways, so we get $24$ ways totally.

1,Is there an efficient algorithm for iterating over binary strings where each of the reciprocal is enumerated exactly once?,Is there an efficient algorithm for iterating over binary strings where each of the reciprocal is enumerated exactly once?,,"Problem. Say we have binary strings of length $n$ , i.e. $b_1b_2\dots b_n$ . There are $2^n$ of such strings, but in this problem if two strings are reciprocal of each other (have same digits in reverse order), we need to iterate just over one of these. For example we do not want to iterate over $1011$ if we have already gone over $1101$ . Now the question is how most efficiently can this be done? Attempts. We can iterate over all binary strings of given length, and for each string we encounter, we can evaluate the string only if it is "" $\leq$ "" than its reciprocal, where "" $\leq$ "" is any ordering on the strings. For example we can interpret the the string as a binary representation of a number and compare those. In the case above, $(1011)_2=11$ and $(1101)_2=13$ and so if we get to $1011$ , we notice $11\leq 13$ and evaluate that one, whereas at $1101$ we have $13>11$ and ignore that one. Problem is that this approach still requires to iterate over all of $2^n$ strings, I was wondering if we can somehow shortcut this and iterate, ideally, directly over the ""desired"" strings. Perhaps some clever ordering on the strings would do the job. Motivation. This came up when I wanted to iterate over polynomials with $0,1$ coefficients and check if they satisfy certain property, and it turns out that property will be the same for each of the reciprocal, so I just need to check one of those.","Problem.

For example, to do an up-right diagonal, you can go up then right or right then up, so for this path, the answer is 2. For a knight's move, there are 3 ways: UUR, URU, and RUU. We can obviously consider paths rotated multiples of 45 degrees, so I will assume the path goes up and right, and it goes more up than right. I was thinking that for each move a certain number of steps away from the starting point, each point might have a different number of ways of getting there. For a point (a,b) each path can be described by a permutation of the multiset that contains a U steps and b R steps. Therefore, the number of paths of (a, b) is the multinomial coefficient: $${a+b \choose a, b} = \frac {(a + b)!} {a!b!}$$ If (a, b) and (c, d) are the same number of steps away from the starting point, then $a+b = c+d$. So, if we are saying that (a, b) and (c,d) have the same number of paths to them, then the above is also equal to: $${c+d \choose c, d} = \frac {(c + d)!} {c!d!} = \frac {(a + b)!} {c!d!}$$ So, we are only a little algebra away from: $$a!b! = c!d!$$ The whole aim was to show that the number of paths is unique for this distance away from the origin. So I want to prove (or disprove) that (a,b) must be the same point as (c, d) ignoring rotations, which amounts to the question I asked.

36,Proving Average Fixed Points of a Permutation on n Letter is 1,Proving Average Fixed Points of a Permutation on n Letter is 1,,"I'm in a combinatorics reading group and I was asked to prove that the average number of fixed points in a permutation on $n$ letters is $1$. I was also told to use the expansion for $log(1-x)$ and the equation $$\sum_{n \ge 0}\frac{t^{n}}{n!}A_{n}(x) = e^{tx + \sum_{n \ge 2}\frac{t^{k}}{k}}$$ where $A_{n}(x) = \sum_{w \in S_{n}}x^{fp(w)}$, $S_{n}$ is the set of all permutations on $n$ letters, and $fp(w)$ is the number of fixed points in a permutation. My Attempt: I decided to find the generating functions for the sum of all fixed points in $S_{n}$ and $|S_{n}|$. To my understanding these should be the same function so multiplying one by the other's reciprocal should yield $1$. The generating function for the sum of all fixed points in $S_{n}$ is $A_{n}(x)$ so I'm finished there. In my attempt to find a generating functions for $|S_{n}|$ I considered some letter $k$ in $w$. There are $f(n-1)$ ways to chose the order of the other letters and there are $n$ ways to chose the $k$ letter so $f(n) = nf(n-1)$. I then shifted the recurrence to $f(n+1) = (n+1)f(n)$ and used the generating function $F(x) = \sum_{n \ge 0}\frac{f(n)x^{n}}{n!}$ to obtain the differential equation $F' = xF' + F$. But with the convention $F(0) = 1$, $F = \frac{1}{1-x}$. This is where I could use some guidance because the coefficients of my recurrence shouldn't $1,1,\ldots$. P.S. I'm aware I haven't used any of the suggested equations yet either.

The topological product $\underset{X\in Y}{\prod}X$ is a compact $T_2$ space. We now take the $F$ to be the family of all sets $S_G$ of all $f\in \underset{X\in Y}{\prod}X$ such that their restriction to $G$ is injective; for all $G$ finite subsets of $Y$. He claims that $S_G$ is closed and nonempty by the Hall's marriage theorem for finite family. I do not understand why. In particular I ask myself the following things: As matter the nonemptiness I was thinking of finding an injective function using Hall's marriage theorem for the finite family $G$ and then to extend to all $Y$. But how? How can we say that  $\underset{X\in Y}{\prod}X$ is not empty without using the full strenght of the Axiom of Choice? Where do we make (if we make) us of the fact that the product is a $T_2$ space? The closeness of $S_G$ just came from the fact that the projection onto the factor is a continuus function and that the antiimages of closed set is a closed set?,,"['combinatorics', 'logic', 'set-theory', 'axiom-of-choice']"

92,Partition of a set of size n into subsets of size 1 and 2.,Partition of a set of size n into subsets of size 1 and 2.,,"Before I ask the question, I must admit that combinatorics has never been my forte. I am given a set X of size $n$, we may assume assume $X=\{1,2,...,n\}$. I want to count the partition of this set into subsets of size either 1 or 2. Let's denote the set of such partitions by $T_{n}$. I can find a recurrence equation for $|T_{n}|$. If I take one such partition, then the element $n$ must be in a subset of either size 2 or 1: let $R_{2}$ be the set of partitions in $T_{n}$ where $n$ is in a subset of size 2, and let $R_{1}$ be the set of partitions in $T_{n}$ where $n$ is in a subset of size 1. Then $R_{1}\cup R_{2}=T_{n}$ and their intersection is empty, so $|R_{1}|+ |R_{2}|=|T_{n}|$. In fact $R_{1}$ is simply $T_{n-1}$ and $R_{2}$ is $(n-1)T_{n-2}$ (as I have $n-1$ choices for the element in the same subset in which $n$ lies and then I can partition the remaining $n-2$ elements in $|T_{n-2}|$ ways). So $|T_{n}|=(n-1)|T_{n-1}|+|T_{n-2}|$. This recurrence relation seems to work (in a very heuristic way, I have checked it for few $n$'s), but I am not sure it is right. I can construct a bijection between $T_{n}$ and the set $U_{n}$ of elements of the symmetric group $S_{n}$  with cycles types which are a sequence of 2's and 1's. For example, I tried to calculate $|U_{6}|$ as follows: I have a single choice for the permutation of cycle type $(1,1,1,1,1,1)$, $\frac{6!}{2*5!}$ for the permutation with cycle type $(2,1,1,1,1)$, $\frac{6!}{4*4!}$ for the permutation with cycle type $(2,2,1,1)$, and $\frac{6!}{8*3!}$ for the permutation with cycle type $(2,2,2)$ but this gives me $26.5$. The questions are: Is my recurrence relation correct? Where is my error in counting the elements of $U_{6}$? Thank you so much in advance and I hope the questions are clear. Erratum : I mis-wrote the recurrence relation, it should read $|T_{n}|=(n-1)|T_{n-2}|+|T_{n-1}|$.","Before I ask the question, I must admit that combinatorics has never been my forte.
