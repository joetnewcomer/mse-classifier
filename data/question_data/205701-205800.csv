My Proof : Call $d_n=a_{n+1}-a_n$ ; then from the given conditions we get, $$\sqrt{a_{n-1}} \leq d_n \leq \sqrt{a_n}$$ and $$\sqrt{a_{n}} \leq d_{n+1} \leq \sqrt{a_{n+1}}$$ Subtracting these, we get, $$d_{n+1}-d_n \leq \sqrt{a_{n+1}}-\sqrt{a_n} \quad \text{(we only took upper bound into account)}$$ $$ \implies a_{n+2}+ a_n \leq \sqrt{a_{n+1}}-\sqrt{a_n} \implies a_n + \sqrt{a_n} \leq \sqrt{a_{n+1}} - a_{n+2} \implies a_{n+2} \leq \sqrt{a_{n+1}} \implies a_{n+2}^2 \leq a_{n+1}$$ But also, $a_{n+1}^2 \leq a_{n+2}^2$ . Hence $$a_{n+1}^2 \leq a_{n+2}^2 \leq a_{n+1} \implies a_{n+1}=a_{n+2}=1$$ Inductively, we get $a_i= 1 \quad \forall \quad i=1,2,3, \cdots$ . but from the condition given in the problem, $1 \leq  (1-1)^2 \leq 1$ is wrong. Hence, there is no such sequence of natural numbers. My concern about my solution is that it feels very loose to me, I think I didn't use the lower bound to its full ability, so I would like to know if there is any fault in my solution.","Show that there does not exist a sequence of positive integers such that , .

Here is a look into the procedure I used for $n=5$ : $$\left(x+y\right)^n = x^5 + 5 x^4 y + 10 x^3 y^2 + 10 x^2 y^3 + 5 x y^4 + y^5 = x^5 + y^5$$ $$5\left(x^4y + 2x^3y^2 + 2x^2y^3 + xy^4\right) = 0$$ $$xy\left(x^3 + 2x^2y + 2xy^2 + y^3\right) = 0$$ So either $x = 0 \lor y = 0$ gives us a solution, so now we consider the part inside parenthesis $$x^3 + 2x^2y + 2xy^2 + y^3= x^3 + 3x^2y + 3xy^2 + y^3 - x^2y - xy^2 = 0$$ $$\left(x+y\right)^3 - xy\left(x + y\right) = 0$$ So either $$xy = \left(x+y\right)^2 \iff 0 = x^2 + xy + y^2 \iff x = -y $$ or $$\left(x+y\right)^3 = 0 \land \left(x+y\right) = 0 \iff x = -y$$ For a generic $n$ , I went with: $$\left(x+y\right)^n = \sum_{k = 0}^n \binom{n}{k}x^{n-k}y^k = x^n + y^n$$ Unpacking the first and last term of the sum that gives us $$\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \binom{n}{k}x^{n-k}y^k = 0$$ $$xy\left(\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \binom{n}{k}x^{n-1-k}y^{k-1}\right) = 0$$ Which proves the condition $x = 0 \lor y = 0 \implies \left(x+y\right)^n = x^n + y^n$ Now I tried to find a way to transform the inner sum into the form $$\left(x+y\right)^{n-2} - z\left(x+y\right)$$ Where $z$ is any possible polynomial that uses $x$ or $y$ or both This way I should resolve $$\left(x+y\right)^{n-2} = \left(x+y\right) = 0$$ which yields $x = -y$ as the only result excluding $x = y = 0$ --- Update --- Following Mark Bennet advise, I went on to prove that, with $|x| > |y|, z = y/x$ (I also tried with $z = x/y$ ), the sum $$\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\binom{n}{i}z^i = 0 \iff z = -1 \lor z = 0$$ which for $z < 0$ has the same number of positive and negative terms. Due to the properties of the binomial, we also know that the $i$ -th and the $\left(n-i\right)$ -th term of the sum have the same coefficient $\binom{n}{i}$ .

Do to prove such a thing, I had 3 main ideas: -prove that every element of the sum differs by values whose sum $\neq 0$ -prove that the sum has only 2 real solutions, so that they can only be $z = 0 \lor z = 1$ -prove that the sum is a parabola: this implies that it only has 2 real solutions But again, I cannot find a way to prove such things --- Update 2 --- Thinking about the problem, I tried to pose it as $$\left(1+z\right)^n < 1 + z^n$$ with $z = y/x \land -1 < z < 0$ (We already proved for $z$ > 0 that the claim is false) So, listing down a couple of things: $$1 + z < 1 \land z^n < z \implies \left(1+z\right)^n < 1 +z < 1 + z^n \forall n$$ This means that $$\forall z \in \left(-1, 0\right), \left(1+z\right)^n\neq 1 + z^n$$ As this is the only left range, it means that $z$ must either be $-1 \lor 0$ , which implies $y = 0 \lor x = -y$ , which proves our claim","I was going through Calculus by Spivak when in the first chapter I encountered problem 16, which in the end recites you should know make a good guess as to when quoting the results of previous exercises with a fixed , which had this result iff I started going on with the proof and immediately thought of using induction, but I was later discouraged about it when, seeing how I ""proved"" the cases with fixed , I wasn't using an ""induction-like"" procedure, and I found myself lost (I saw Spivak proof and he uses Rolle's theorem on the function , but it isn't a proof that I find satisfying, as I think there's a proof that doesn't use such methods.

Then, ${n\choose k} {k\choose m} = {n\choose m} {{n-m}\choose {k-m}}.$ Here is my Polished Proof: Claim: Suppose $k$ , $m$ , and $n$ are positive integers such that $n\geq k\geq m\geq 0$ . Then, ${n\choose k} {k\choose m} = {n\choose m} {{n-m}\choose {k-m}}.$ Proof: To prove ${n\choose k} {k\choose m}$ $=$ $ {n\choose m} {{n-m}\choose {k-m}}$ let's imagine that we have a class of $n$ people and we will choose $k$ of them to form a committee, of those on the committee we will choose $m$ of them to be on the subcommittee. We will consider the question: How many $k$ -element subsets of people does the set $\{1,2,3...,n  \}$ have, and of $k$ people how many, $m$ -element subsets of people does $k$ have? Answer 1: Given $n$ people, we can form a committee of size $k$ in ${n\choose k}$ ways to get $k$ -element subsets. Once the committee is selected, we can form a subcommittee of size $m$ in ${k\choose m}$ ways to get $m$ -elements. Thus, we can form $k$ -element subsets of $n$ and $m$ -element subsets of $k$ by ${n\choose k} {k\choose m}$ . Answer 2: On the other hand, we can achieve the same total of ways by  forming a subcommittee of size $m$ in ${n\choose m}$ ways to get $m$ -element subsets. Once we have selected the subcommittee we can form a committee of the remaining size of $(k-m)$ in ${{n-m}\choose {k-m}}$ to get $(k-m)$ -element subsets.

I've looked at similar questions here and here , but neither seem to directly prove the predicate by induction, with a base case followed by the inductive step. Solution(?): Let P(n) be the predicate (All n, n >= 1, any tree with n vertices has (n-1) edges). Base case (n=1): P(1): (n=1, any tree with 1 vertice has 0 edges). A tree G is a connected graph with no cycles of length at least three. An edge E is a two-element subset of the set of all vertices V of G . In the base case, V contains one vertice. Thus there are zero two-element subsets of V , or zero edges, in G . Inductive Step: For every n>0, P(n) => P(n+1). For P(n+1), where n>0 in G , n+1 vertices will form exactly n edges. All vertices are of degree 1, which means there is exactly one less edge than vertice (one edge per vertice, excluding the root vertice). Thus, any tree with n vertices will have exactly n-1 edges. Assume P(n) is true. Then, we want to prove that the graph G , for P(n+1), has n edges. G contains no cycles of length at least three. Thus, G must contain only one region, meaning that the edges in G do not form any regions. This means that G must contain at least one leaf (vertex with degree of 1). Obtain a graph G' by removing one leaf from G . Because a leaf is a vertex of 1, by the definition of vertex degree, the leaf is connected to exactly one edge. Thus, removing the leaf will remove one vertex and one edge from G , to create G' . This means that for all n, n>=1, any tree with (n+1) vertices will have ((n+1)-1). or n, edges. We have proven that the case base P(1) is true, and assuming that P(n) is true, we see that the statement remains true for n => n+1. Thus, the predicate (All n, n >= 1, any tree with n vertices has (n-1) edges) is true by induction. Assume P(n) is true. Then, we want to prove that the graph G , for P(n+1), has n edges. G contains no cycles of length at least three. Thus, G must contain only one region, meaning that the edges in G do not form any regions. This means that G must contain at least one leaf (vertex with degree of 1). Remove a leaf l from G to obtain a tree G′ with n vertices. Then, G' has n−1 edges, by the inductive hypothesis. The addition of l to G′ produces a graph with n+1 vertices and n edges, since l has degree 1. P(1) is true, and for every n>0, P(n) => P(n+1). Thus, the predicate must be true. I'm not exactly sure how to proceed for the inductive step., or if I doing it correctly.

56,Showing that the McCarthy Function is a well-defined function from the set of positive integers to the set of positive integers,Showing that the McCarthy Function is a well-defined function from the set of positive integers to the set of positive integers,,"For those of you who aren't familiar, the McCarthy Function states that $M(n) = n − 10$ if $n > 100$ and $M(M(n + 11))$ if $n \leq 100$ (a recursive function). I'm trying to prove that this function is a well-defined function from the set of positive integers to the set of positive integers, and I'm starting off by proving that $M(n) = 91$ for all positive integers $n$ with $n \leq 101$.  Here's how I approached the proof: For $90 \leq n < 101$, $$\begin{array}{rl} M(n) &= M(M(n + 11))\\ &= M(n + 11 - 10), \, \text{where}\, n + 11 \geq 101\,\, \text{since}\, \, n \geq 90 \\ &= M(n + 1)\end{array}$$ So $M(n) = 91$ for $90 ≤ n < 101$.

There are no holes between the blocks, so $M(n) = 91$ for $n < 101$. We can also add $n = 101$ as a special case.

Am I right in concluding, that an approximated expression with the absolute error that doesn't converge to $0$ cannot be expanded this way (e.g. $ln(1 + n^{-1} + O(n))$)? 9.14 Prove that $(n + a)^{n + b} = n^{n + b}e^{a}(1 + a(b - \dfrac{a}{2})n^{-1} + O(n^{-2}))$. I transform the LHS so as to make it easier to compare with what we have on the RHS. \begin{equation} \begin{split} (n+a)^{n+b} &= (n(1 + \dfrac{a}{n}))^{n+b} = n^{n+b}(1 + \dfrac{a}{n})^{n+b} = n^{n+b} \exp((n+b) \ln(1 + \dfrac{a}{n})) \\ &= n^{n+b}exp((n+b)(\dfrac{a}{n} - \dfrac{a^2}{2n^2} + O((n^{-3}))) \hspace{12pt} \text{// by the $ln(1+z)$ approx.} \\ &= n^{n+b} \exp(a - \dfrac{a^2}{2n} + O(n^{-2}) + \dfrac{ab}{n} - \dfrac{a^2b}{2n^2} + O(n^{-3})) \\ &= n^{n+b} e^a \exp(\dfrac{-a^2}{2n} + \dfrac{ab}{n} - \dfrac{a^2b}{2n^2} + O(n^{-2}))\\ &= \ldots \end{split} \end{equation} (First I'd like to make sure that the step from the 3rd to the 4th line is formally correct - is it enough to say that $O(n^{-3}) \subset O(n^{-2})$)? Anyway, I don't really know how to move from here. One attempt would be to use the $e^z$ expansion, but the result doesn't look very nice. Or I have made a mistake I can't yet see. It looks like I've written a pretty long post. :) I know some of my questions may sound trivial (or there may be some basic mistakes above), but I'm trying to make head and tail of that whole asymptotics and need a little assistance :)",,"['discrete-mathematics', 'asymptotics']"

But attempting to do this for two irregular pushdown transductions in the same straightforward way we get a transducer with two stacks (which is equivalent to Turing machine), which gives us nothing we have not known before…","V = (A, B, S, Q_A, Q_S, \phi, \psi, \chi, q_0) A B S Q_A Q_S \phi: (Q_A \times A) \cup (Q_S \times (S \cup \{ \epsilon \})) \to (Q_A \cup Q_S) \epsilon \not\in S \psi: (Q_A \times A) \cup (Q_S \times (S \cup \{ \epsilon \})) \to S^* \epsilon \not\in S \chi: (Q_A \times A) \cup (Q_S \times (S \cup \{ \epsilon \})) \to B^* \epsilon \not\in S q_0 \in Q_A V V f_V: A^* \to  (Q_A \cup Q_S) \cup S^* \to B^* f_V(\Lambda, q, \sigma) = \Lambda f_V(a\alpha, q, \Lambda) = \begin{cases} \chi(q, a) f_V(\alpha, \phi(q, a), \psi(q, a)) & \quad q \in Q_A  \\ \chi(q, \epsilon) f_V(\alpha, \phi(q, \epsilon), \psi(q, \epsilon)) & \quad q \in Q_S \end{cases} f_V(a\alpha, q, \sigma s) = \begin{cases} \chi(q, a) f_V(\alpha, \phi(q, a),  \sigma s \psi(q, a)) & \quad q \in Q_A \\ \chi(q, s) f_V(\alpha, \phi(q, s), \sigma \psi(q, s)) & \quad q \in Q_S \end{cases} t_V(A^*) = f_V(A^*, q_0, \Lambda) A^* \to B^*","['abstract-algebra', 'discrete-mathematics', 'automata', 'semigroups', 'pushdown-automata']"

Prove that the smallest positive integers $a\geq b$ for which, starting in state $(a,b)$ , the state machine will make $n$ transitions are $F(n+1)$ and $F(n)$ , where $F(n)$ is the $n$ -th Fibonacci number. Note : $\mathrm{rem}(x,y)$ denotes the remainder of the division of $x$ by $y$ . Can someone please verify this solution? Solution Proof by induction. Induction hypothesis : $P(n)$ := the smallest positive integers $a \geq b$ for which, starting in state $(a,b)$ , the state machine will make $n$ transitions are $F(n+1)$ and $F(n)$ . Base case ( $n = 1$ ): $P(1)$ is the proposition: the smallest positive integers $a \geq b$ for which, starting in state $(a,b)$ , the state machine will make $1$ transition are $a = F(2) = 1$ and $b = F(1) = 1$ . $P(1)$ is true, because, starting at state $(F(2), F(1)) = (1,1)$ , there's one transition to $(1,0)$ , after which there are no more transitions. Inductive step : Assume that $P(n)$ is true for some $n \geq 1$ . Then, the smallest positive integers $a \geq b$ for which, starting in state $(a,b)$ , the state machine will make $n$ transitions are $F(n+1)$ and $F(n)$ . We want to show $P(n + 1)$ . Suppose that there are integers $a$ and $b$ , with $a \geq b$ , for which, starting in state $(a,b)$ , the state machine makes $n + 1$ transitions. From state $(a,b)$ , there is one transition to $(b, \mathrm{rem}(a,b))$ . So, from $(b, \mathrm{rem}(a,b))$ , the state machine makes $n$ transitions. Therefore, by the induction hypothesis, $b \geq F(n + 1)$ and $\mathrm{rem}(a,b) \geq F(n)$ . By the division theorem, $\mathrm{rem}(a,b) = a - qb$ , where $q$ is an integer. So, $a - qb >= F(n)$ . Also, since $a \geq b$ , then $q \geq 1$ . Therefore: $$a \geq F(n) + qb \geq F(n) + b \geq F(n) + F(n + 1) \geq F(n + 2)$$ Therefore, $a \geq F(n + 2)$ and $b \geq F(n + 1)$ . Now, I will show that, starting from $(F(n+2), F(n+1))$ , the state machine will make $n + 1$ transitions. Consider the state $T = (F(n + 2), F(n + 1))$ . It has a transition to $T' = (F(n + 1), \mathrm{rem}(F(n+2), F(n+1)))$ . But $\mathrm{rem}(F(n+2), F(n+1)) = \mathrm{rem}(F(n) + F(n+1), F(n+1)) = \mathrm{rem}(F(n), F(n+1)) = F(n)$ . So, $T' = (F(n + 1), F(n))$ . By the induction hypothesis, starting from $T'$ , the state machine makes $n$ transitions. Therefore, starting from $T$ , the state machine makes $n + 1$ transitions. It follows that the smallest positive integers $a \geq b$ for which, starting in state $(a,b)$ , the state machine will make $n+1$ transitions are $a=F(n+2)$ and $b=F(n+1)$ . This proves $P(n + 1)$ . Therefore, by induction, $P(n)$ is true for all $n\geq 1$ .","Problem The Euclidean state machine is defined by the rule for .

74,When are Hamming codes cyclic?,When are Hamming codes cyclic?,,"Motivation The following statement appears to be true: The $q$ -ary Hamming code of codimension $r$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$ is equivalent to a cyclic code if and only if if $q-1$ and $r$ are coprime. See for example this answer by Dietrich Burde as a in-house quotation. The $\Leftarrow$ -direction is not too hard to show (making use of a primitive element of the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q^r}$ ), but I could not find a proof for the other direction anywhere. I've checked various sources like web search, search on this page math.stackexchange, as well as standard books on coding theory like MacWilliams-Sloane, van Lint or Huffman-Pless. Question Assume that $q-1$ and $r$ at not coprime. Show that the $q$ -ary Hamming code of codimension $r$ is not equivalent to a cyclic code. Dietrich Burde pointed me to the book of Huffman & Pless, ""Fundamentals of Error-Correcting codes"", 2003. I checked this book again, but I cannot find the full desired statement nor a proof. The closest things I can find are: Theorem 5.1.4 on page 169 shows that for $\gcd(r,q-1) = 1$ , the $q$ -ary Hamming code of codimension $r$ is a narrow-sense BCH code, which gives "" $\Leftarrow$ "". Corollary 5.1.5 on page 170 observes that as a consequence, all binary Hamming codes are primitive narrow-sense BCH codes. Example 5.1.6 shows that the $[4,2,3]$ ternary Hamming code is not cyclic, which is close to this question . Part of the reasoning is left as the subsequent Exercise 288. (In my opinion, the direction proposed by Huffman and Pless using the automorphism group of order $48$ is unnecessarily complicated. Better observe that there are only two cyclic ternary $[4,2]$ codes and their generator polynomials have weight only $2$ .) I certainly did not check the whole book, but I could not find anything else. If the statement indeed was there, I would expect a pointer at Theorem 5.1.4 orExample 4.1.6 to the general statement.","Motivation The following statement appears to be true: The -ary Hamming code of codimension over is equivalent to a cyclic code if and only if if and are coprime.

For $ n\geq 0$ let $c_n$ be the number of n-character sequences of elements of T that contain no consecutive letters (distinct or identical) I believe there has to be two cases here. eg.. One where $a_{10}$ ends in a letter then $a_{11}$ has 4 choices for the 11th digit ${1,2,3 or 4}$ else if $a_{10}$ ends with a number then we can pick any element from the set T for the 11th character in $a_{11}$ Is my understanding of the question correct ?
