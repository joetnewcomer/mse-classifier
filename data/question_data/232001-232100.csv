0,Why is $2^\omega$ not a larger cardinal then $\omega$?,Why is  not a larger cardinal then ?,2^\omega \omega,"Cantor's diagonalization argument shows that the power set of natural numbers is larger than $\aleph_0$ , that is, it has a larger cardinality. Every natural number could either be in any given set of the superset, or it could be out of said set. So, that gives two possibilities for every natural number. Since there are infinite natural numbers, that is $2^\omega$ different sets. Therefore, the superset of the natural numbers has an order of $2^\omega$ . Therefore, $2^\omega$ has a larger cardinality than $\omega$ because it can not be counted, as it is equal to the superset of natural numbers, which is of a larger cardinality then the set of all natural numbers.

1,Can this set of subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ be uncountable? [duplicate],Can this set of subsets of  be uncountable? [duplicate],\mathbb{N},"This question already has an answer here : Finding an uncountable chain of subsets the integers (1 answer) Closed 4 years ago . Let $S$ be a collection of subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ such that for every $A, B ∈ S$ we have $A ⊂ B$ or $B ⊂ A$ . Can $S$ be uncountable? I think we don't have to be concerned about elements of $S$ which are finite subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ , as finite subsets can be listed by their size according to this property. But I am not sure how to treat infinite subsets. It would be much appreciated if comments and answers come in the form of hints rather than complete solutions as I think I'd benefit more that way.","This question already has an answer here : Finding an uncountable chain of subsets the integers (1 answer) Closed 4 years ago .

3,Bijection and Uncountable Sets (understanding),Bijection and Uncountable Sets (understanding),,"I'm trying to understand different sizes of infinities and what everything means (trying to piece everything together). So if we find a bijection between a set $A$ and another set $B$ where $B$ is countable (countably infinite), then that implies $A$ is countable (is that correct). Moreover, we can find a bijection between any two countable sets (I think this is correct). If we find a bijection between two finite sets, then the two sets must be of the same cardinality. A proper subset of a finite set, A has smaller cardinality than the set $A$ . However, every infinite subset of a countable set is countable. For example, $\mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable and $\mathbb{Z}$ is countable. I get confused, however, when dealing with uncountable sets. Is it true that I can find always bijection between uncountable sets? For example, is it always possible to construct a bijection between two uncountable sets. Are there examples of cases where you can construct a bijection between two uncountable sets and cases where you cannot? For example, is there a bijection between $[0,1]$ and $\mathbb{R}$ ?

50,No duplicate: Is there a set $X$ such that $X=X^X$?,No duplicate: Is there a set  such that ?,X X=X^X,"Given two sets $A$ and $B$ we define $B^A$ to be the set of all functions from $A$ to $B$ . Question. Is there a set $X$ with $X=X^X$ ? One may ask the question: Why the hell do I have to ask this question twice? Yes, I already asked this question on math.stackexchange and I got an answer. The argument for proving that there is not a set $X$ with $X=X^X$ goes as follows: Recall that a function $X\to X$ is really a subset $f\subseteq X\times X$ satisfying the requirement $$\forall a\in X.\ \exists! b\in X.\ (a, b)\in X.$$ Also, note that a pair $(a, b)$ is defined as the set $\{\{a\}, \{a, b\}\}$ . Now, suppose there is an $X$ with $X=X^X$ . Since $\emptyset$ is obviously not the same as the set $\emptyset^{\emptyset}=\{\mathrm{id}_\emptyset\}$ and for $X$ with $|X| \geq 2$ we have $|X^X| \geq |2^X|> |X|$ and therefore $X\not = X^X$ , we can infer that $|X|=1$ . Let $X=\{\bullet\}$ . This unique element $\bullet\in X$ has to be equal to the function $\mathrm{id}_X$ because we supposed $X$ to be the same as $X^X = \{\mathrm{id}_X\}$ . According to our definitions $$\mathrm{id}_X=\{(\bullet, \bullet)\}=\{\{\{\bullet\}, \{\bullet, \bullet\}\}\}=\{\{\{\bullet\}\}\}.$$ But we have already said that $\mathrm{id}_X=\bullet$ . Hence $\bullet=\{\{\{\bullet\}\}\}$ which is forbidden by the axiom of regularity . Conclusion: If one codes functions as special subsets of the cartesian product and pairs as special sets, my question has an easy solution with the help of the axiom of regularity. But in my opinion, these encodings are unnatural and do not convey the true nature of functions and pairs. That is why I wonder how to answer my question above when one regards functions and pairs as non-sets , that is to say as objects that are not sets. Remark. I was not able to edit my old question because I asked it with a quest account and I got automatically logged out. By the way: In his book ""Analysis 1"", Terry Tao proposed a natural axiom system of set theory with non-sets and in particular he comments: ""Strictly speaking, functions are not sets, and sets are not functions"" My question also can be viewed as asking if the problem whether there is a set $X$ with $X=X^X$ is decidable in the axiom system proposed by Terry Tao.","Given two sets and we define to be the set of all functions from to .

Every uncountable set has cardinality $\geq 2^{\aleph_0}$ Now, an infinite set can only be countable or uncountable, so how does this concept not negate the possible existence of a set $S$ such that $\aleph_0<|S|<2^{\aleph_0}?$ I am guessing the issue is that claim $(3)$ is in fact not necessarily true. If so, I would be glad to hear more on why this is not the case. I've only started looking into this area of mathematics recently, so pardon me if my question is naive.",,"['elementary-set-theory', 'definition', 'cardinals']"
95,An example of an operation in ordinary arithmetic that is idempotent,An example of an operation in ordinary arithmetic that is idempotent,,"I came across this question in the book Axiomatic set theory by Suppes: Can you give an example of an operation of ordinary arithmetic which is idempotent? So, here I have some things that I cannot completly understand and I need your help: What is the meaning of ordinary arithmetic ? I would understand that it means $+$ and $\times$ on $\mathbb R$, but I'm not sure. Does the meaning of an operation which is idempotent mean for all the elements of the universe? I mean I can think of $1$ in $\times$ or $0$ in $+$ because $1\times 1=1$ and $0+0=0$, does this count?","I came across this question in the book Axiomatic set theory by Suppes: Can you give an example of an operation of ordinary arithmetic which is idempotent?
