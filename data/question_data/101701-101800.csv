4,Inscribing rhombus in a triangle's angle in only eight compass-and-straightedge steps,Inscribing rhombus in a triangle's angle in only eight compass-and-straightedge steps,,"EUCLIDEA ANDROID PROBLEM 13.1 Here is a surprisingly intriguing challenge posed on the latest version of Euclidea, a mobile app for Euclidean constructions. The problem used to be considered easy when a nine-step solution was the shortest one known. However, an eight-step construction has just been found. The task is to find this record-breaking construction. Given $\Delta{ABC}$  with sides fully constructed ( figure below ). Goal Construct yellow rhombus $AC'A'B'$ in the figure in exactly eight elementary steps ('8E') , with $C' \in \overline{AB}$, $A' \in \overline{BC}$, and $B' \in \overline{AC}$. Clarifications All sides of the rhombus must be constructed to complete the construction. Only an unmarked straightedge and a non-rusty collapsible compass ( i.e. , a compass that, while on paper, can have any radius but which cannot maintain said radius when not on paper) can be used. Elementary steps are accounted for in the following way. Construct a point: 0 elementary steps (E). Mark the intersection of two curves with a point: 0E. Construct a new line (*or line segment or ray): 1E. Extend a given line segment (*or ray): 1E. Construct a circle (non-rusty collapsible compass): 1E. Construct the perpendicular bisector of a line segment: 3E. Construct a new line perpendicular to an old line: 3E. Hints from Euclidea (including Twitter support) A known 8E solution employs elementary steps in the order: circle, circle, line, line, circle, line, line, and line. Homothety is employed. It may be helpful to consider the dotted rhombus $AC''XB''$ shown in the figure. There is a claim that $X$, the vertex of the dotted rhombus opposite $A$, can be constructed in the first three moves (circle, circle, line). There is also a claim that similarity of isosceles triangles is important. Previous work Many of the hints come from my online interactions with Euclidea support on Twitter. I know the 9E solution: The first four steps construct the bisector $\overline{AX}$ of $\angle{BAC}$, $A'$ is the intersection of $\overline{AX}$ and $\overline{BC}$, Steps 5 to 7 perpendicularly bisect $\overline{AX}$ to define $B'$ and $C'$, and finally Steps 8 and 9 construct the remaining sides $\overline{A'B'}$ and $\overline{A'C'}$ of the desired rhombus. I am mystified by the two-fold claim that the first three steps of the 8E construction are (circle, circle, line) and can construct $X$. On one hand, I know a way to construct $X$ in the first three moves , but these moves are all circles. On the other hand, I know how to construct $\overleftrightarrow{CX}$ in the first four moves according to the Euclidea's hinted sequence of steps (circle, circle, line, line), but that construction does not define $X$ itself: Construct two circles through $C$, one centered at $A$ and another centered at $B$; construct the other  intersection $D$ of these two circles; construct diameter $\overleftrightarrow{AD}$ of the circle centered on $A$; construct that diameter's other intersection point $E$ with the circle centered on $A$, and construct $\overleftrightarrow{CE} = \overleftrightarrow{CX}$. SOLUTION 1 WITH PROOF: From @Aretino, who got the +50 bounty This solution maximizes the use of homothety. $A$ is defined as the homothetic center, and the desired 'yellow' rhombus is constructed by homothetic based on the 'dotted' rhombus with side length $AC$. A fundamental assumption is that the remaining vertices of the given triangle are labeled $B$ and $C$ such that $AC < BC$ . Merely to make the vertex labeling consistent with the given figure shown above, the triangle was first 'massaged' slightly such that its 'left' side was shorter than its 'right' one. Therefore, $B$ is the other 'bottom' vertex, while $C$ is the 'top' one. Construct circle $C(A)$ centered on $C$ with radius $CA$. [1E running total] Construct intersection point $D := \overline{BC} \cap C(A)$. [1E running total] Construct circle $B(D)$. [2E running total] Construct intersection point $E := \overline{AB} \cap B(D)$. [2E running total] Construct $\overleftrightarrow{DE}$. [3E running total] Construct the other intersection point $X := \overleftrightarrow{DE} \cap C(A)$. $X$ is a key point: the vertex opposite $A$ on the big, dotted rhombus in the given figure. [3E running total] Focus on circle $C(D) = C(X)$. $D$ and $X$ are both on this circle, so $\overline{CD} \cong \overline{CX}$ and $\Delta{CDX}$ is an isosceles triangle. By the isosceles triangle theorem , the base angles of $\Delta{DCX}$ are congruent: $\angle{CDX} \cong \angle{CXD}$. Next, focus on circle $B(D) = B(E)$. $D$ and $X$ are both on this other circle, so $\overline{BD} \cong \overline{BE}$ and $\Delta{DBE}$ is an isosceles triangle. By the isosceles triangle theorem , the base angles of $\Delta{DBE}$ are congruent: $\angle{BDE} \cong \angle{BED}$. Then, focus on $\overline{BC}$ and $\overline{EX}$. These lines define a pair of vertical angles, which are by definition congruent: $\angle{CDX} \cong \angle{BDE}$. It follows from transitivity of congruence that $\angle{BED} \cong \angle{CXD}$. These congruent angles can be viewed as alternate interior angles defined by transversal $\overleftrightarrow{EX}$ and lines $\overleftrightarrow{CX}$ and $\overleftrightarrow{BE} = \overleftrightarrow{AE}$. Elements I.27 therefore dictates that $\overleftrightarrow{CX} \parallel \overleftrightarrow{AE}$. This parallelism, together with Elements I.29 , implies that $\angle{DCX} \cong \angle{DBE}$. Focus on circle $C(A) = C(X)$. $A$ and $X$ are both on this circle, so $\overline{AC} \cong \overline{CX}$. $\Delta{ACX}$ is thus an isosceles triangle. By the isosceles triangle theorem , the base angles of $\Delta{ACX}$ are congruent: $\angle{CAX} \cong \angle{CXA}$. Then, observe that $\Delta{ACX}$ has apex angle $\angle{ACX} = \angle{ACD} + \angle{DCX} = \angle{ACB} + \angle{DCX} = \angle{ACB} + \angle{DBE}$. That is, the measure of the apex angle $\angle{ACX}$ is the sum of the measures of $\angle{ABC}$ and $\angle{ACB}$, i.e. , the vertex angles in the given $\Delta{ABC}$. Therefore, the sum of the measures of the congruent angles $\angle{CAX}$ and $\angle{CXA}$ equals the measure of $\angle{CAB}$. In particular, $\angle{CAX}$ has half the measure of $\angle{CAB}$. $\angle{BAX}$ therefore also has half the measure of $\angle{CAB}$. In short, $\overleftrightarrow{AX}$ bisects $\angle{CAB}$. Given that $\overleftrightarrow{BE} \parallel \overleftrightarrow{AE}$, $\overline{AC} \cong \overline{CX}$, $\overleftrightarrow{AX}$ bisects $\angle{CAB}$, and that a rhombus is a parallelogram whose sides are congruent and (equivalently) whose diagonals bisect their respective vertex angles, conclude that the points $A$, $C$, and $X$ are vertices of a rhombus with sides of length $AC$ and where $A$ and $X$ are opposite each other.

[4E running total] Construct the other intersection point $A' := \overline{BC} \cap \overline{AX}$. $A'$ is the vertex opposite $A$ on the yellow rhombus to be constructed here. [4E running total] Set $A$ as the homothetic center for the dotted rhombus. By homothety, any straight line through $A$ will pass through 'corresponding' points on the dotted rhombus and the yellow rhombus. In particular, $\overline{AX}$ connects $X$ in the dotted rhombus with $A'$ in the yellow rhombus. But as proven above, $X$ is the vertex opposite $A$ in the dotted rhombus. It follows that $A'$ is the vertex opposite $A$ in the yellow rhombus. Construct circle $A'(D)$. [5E running total] Construct the other intersection point $F := \overleftrightarrow{DE} \cap A'(D)$. [5E running total] Construct $\overline{A'F}$. It is parallel to $\overline{AB}$ and intersects $\overline{AC}$ at a point $B'$ such that $\overline{A'B'} \cong  \overline{AB'}$. [6E running total] Sketch of proof: $A'(D)$ plays the same role as $C(A)$ in Item 6, leading us to claim $\overline{A'B'} \parallel \overline{AB} \parallel \overline{CX}$. The parallelism of $\overline{A'B'}$ with $\overline{CX}$ and the homothety from Item 8 mean that $\overline{A'B'}$ corresponds to $\overline{CX}$. The congruence between $\overline{CX}$ and $\overline{AC}$ must thus correspond to a congruence between $\overline{A'B'}$ and $\overline{AB'}$. Construct the intersection point $B' := \overline{A'F} \cap \overline{AC}$ [6E running total] . Construct $\overline{AD}$. [7E running total] Construct the other intersection point $G := \overline{AD} \cap A'(D)$. [7E running total] Construct $\overleftrightarrow{A'G}$. It is parallel to $\overline{AC}$ and intersects $\overline{AB}$ at a point $C'$ such that $\overline{A'C'} \cong \overline{AC'}$. [8E running total] Sketch of proof: $A'(D)$ plays the same role as $C(A)$ in Item 11, leading us to claim $\overline{A'C'} \parallel \overline{AC} \parallel \overline{BX}$. The parallelism of $\overline{A'C'}$ with $\overline{BX}$ and the homothety from Item 8 mean that $\overline{A'C'}$ corresponds to $\overline{BX}$. The congruence between $\overline{BX}$ and $\overline{AB}$ must thus correspond to a congruence between $\overline{A'C'}$ and $\overline{AC'}$.

The measures of the angles ( $a, b, c, d, e,$ and $f$ ) are also defined as given in the figure below. Conjecture : There aren't any $a, b, c, d, e,$ and $f$ such that all are different integers without using the combinations of the numbers: $6, 54, 42, 18, 48$ , and $12$ . (to clarify, all six of these numbers can not be used together, but they can be used together in groups) How can I prove this conjecture mathematically, and what is so special about these six numbers? My thoughts and work on the problem I am intentionally omitting the degree signs for convenience. Using, the Trigonometric Ceva's Theorem, I obtained the following expression: $$\frac{\sin(a)}{\sin(b)}\cdot\frac{\sin(c)}{\sin(d)}\cdot\frac{\sin(e)}{\sin(f)}= 1$$ which is equivalent to: $$\begin{aligned} \sin(a) \sin(c) \sin(e) = \sin(b) \sin(d) \sin(f)  \end{aligned} \label{a}\tag{1}$$ We also know that, $$a+b=c+d=e+f=60$$ To convert the triple sine product to summations, I used the following ""trick"". Since, $$\sin(a+c+e)=\sin(b+d+f)$$ and also due to $Eq. (1)$ , it is true that: $$\sin(-a+c+e)+\sin(a-c+e)+\sin(a+c-e)$$ $$=\sin(-b+d+f)+\sin(b-d+f)+\sin(b+d-f)$$ Let's substitute $b=60-a, d=60-c$ , and $f=60-e$ and let $x=(c+e-a), y=(a+e-c),$ and $z=(a+c-e)$ to simplify things a bit: $$\sin(x) +\sin(y) +\sin(z)=\sin(60-x)+\sin(60-y) +\sin(60-z)$$ I expanded the $(60-x)$ 's using compound angle formulae: $$\sqrt{3}/2 (\cos(x) + \cos(y) + \cos(z)) - 3/2 (\sin(x) + \sin(y) + \sin(z)) = 0$$ which simplifies to: $$\sin(30-x) +\sin(30-y) +\sin(30-z)=0$$ but I feel lost in the algebra and don't know what to do next. I want to get to a point where I can easily plug numbers and show that no other numbers satisfy this equation, other than the combinations of the six numbers given at the beginning. The trigonometric proof of one of the cases may aid to formulate a proof, so I decided to include it as well: For $a=6, b=54, c=42, d=18, e=48, f=12$ , $Eq. (1)$ is satisfied, so let's prove it. Proof. $$ \sin(12°) \sin(18°) \sin(54°)\stackrel{?}{=} \sin(6°)\sin(42°)\sin(48°)$$ Now we use the ""trick"": $$ \sin(60°)+ \sin(48°)- \sin(24°)\stackrel{?}{=} \sin(84°)+\sin(12°)+\sin(0°)$$ $$\sin(60°)=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \stackrel{?}{=} \sin(12°)+ \sin(24°) - (\sin(48°) -\sin(84°))$$ $$ = 2 \sin(18°) \cos(6°) + 2 \cos(66°) \sin(18°)$$ $$ = 2 \sin(18°) (\cos(6°) + \cos(66°)$$ $$ = 2 \sin(18°) (2\cos(36°)\cos(30°) )$$ $$1 \stackrel{?}{=} 4 \sin(18°) \cos(36°)$$ $$\frac{1}{2} =  \cos(36°) \cos(72°)$$ which is true as it is a well-known identity.

If $P_0P_1>P_1P_2>\cdots>P_{n-1}P_{n}$ , $P_0$ and $P_n$ cannot coincide. While the result is remarkable in itself, the following proof that appears in Titu's 'Mathematical Olympiad Challenges' is just mind blowing : Let us consider complex coordinates with origin at $P_0$ and let the line $P_0P_1$ be the x-axis. Let $\alpha$ be the angle between any two consecutive segments and let $a_1>a_2>\cdots>a_n$ be the lengths of the segments. If we set $z=e^{i(\pi-\alpha)}$ , then the coordinate of $P_n$ is $a_1+a_2z+\cdots+a_n z^{n-1}$ . We must prove that this number is not equal to zero.

26,Can a portion of a hypocycloid be a regular polygon?,Can a portion of a hypocycloid be a regular polygon?,,"Hypocycloids are curves that generally don't include straight lines. A significant exception is a hypocycloid with 2 cusps, generated by rolling one circle inside another having twice the radius of the first, which will generate a completely straight line and no curved portion. An example and a proof of this special case is shown in this link . Aside from this special case, I want to know if a hypocycloid can be generated such that it contains straight line segments that form the edges of a regular polygon. Specifically, I want to know if a hypocycloid of 5 cusps can be generated so that it contains a true regular pentagon, and if so, what is the ""pen position"" as a function of the radius of the smaller circle. The following images were generated at Spiromath . This first one shows generally what I am trying to accomplish. The radius of the larger circle (A) is 120. The radius of the smaller circle (B) is 72. On the web page, it is defined as -72 to cause the smaller circle to roll inside the larger instead of outside, but the end result is still a radius of 72. The ""pen position"", at the end of the green line is 96 in this example, but I think a value of 106 is closer to generating the desired result. The ratio of 72/120 reduces to 3/5 and the denominator defines the number of cusps while the numerator is related to which ""vertices"" are ""connected"" and the number of revolutions required to generate the closed curve. The second picture is the same as the first, but with several additional variations of the ""pen position"" which was varied by increments of 4 to make the drawing. Notice that increasing the pen position causes the portion of the hypocycloid within circle A to become more and more convex, while decreasing the pen position causes the portion within circle A to become increasingly concave. The portion of the hypocycloid outside circle A (the ""points"" of the star"") are always convex. Since the portions within the larger circle vary from convex to concave as the pen position is adjusted within the range shown, I am postulating that there is at least one pen position at which a significant part of curve becomes a straight line. Simply from trial and error, I am speculating that the straight part may span across the entire arc of the outer circle, or it may only span the length of the edge of the inscribed pentagon, or maybe it's somewhere in between. That's about as far as I can take it. I'd like to see if someone can provide a formula for the ""pen position"" that will generate a pentagon precisely bounded by exactly straight lines, and also show how far those line actually remain straight, or if this is impossible, provide a proof that it is impossible. I am specifically looking for the case of a pentagon, but it would be great to have a general answer that applies to any hypocycloid bounding any regular polygon such as an equilateral triangle, square or other n-gon. UPDATE: I discovered that although I have been using the term hypocycloid, the curve I am actually describing a hypotrochoid. A hypocycloid is a special instance of a hypotrochoid where the pen position equals the radius of the smaller circle. This will not be true for the solution to this question so the proper term for the curve I'm trying to find is a hypotrochoid. The parametric equations for a hypotrochoid are found at MathWorld . I am also adding a new image created with Geometer's Sketchpad. It shows a pair of complimentary hypotrochoids. In this case, the red radius is 3/5 of the green radius and the blue radius is 2/5 of the green radius. Their ""pen positions"" have been adjusted by eye until the curve closely approaches the vertical lines indicated to the left of center. The red hypotrochoid is similar to those in the other images, although the blue one is a viable alternative solution to my problem. Finally, note that I have a good background in algebra and trig, but no analytic geometry or calculus, so answers that don't require calculus are preferred, although an answer that requires calculus is better than no answer at all, although I may need additional explanation in that case.

37,Circle on sphere,Circle on sphere,,"Foreword This question was inspired by initial mistakes in this question . I wanted to explore the strange circle with $A>\pi r^2$ and got lost into geometrical jungle. A spherical cap is usually described by it's height $h$, radius of the base $a$ and radius of the sphere $r$. Besides we have a relation $a^2+(r-h)^2=r^2$ so the cap actually only has two degrees of freedom. When considering a case of circle on a sphere (like the Earth), it's the surface of a spherical cap, but we can't see the height or other classic parameters of this spherical cap. Instead we encounter parameters like area $A$, perimeter $C$ and diameter $d$. I will try to write formulae for these: $$A=2\pi rh$$ $$C=2\pi a$$ $$d=2r\theta$$ Where $\theta$ is introduced with $\sin\theta=\frac{a}{r}$ or $\cos\theta=(1-\frac{h}{r})$. As the cap only has two degrees of freedom, it should be a good problem with unique solution if only two values are known. A-C Problem The simple example: $A$ and $C$ are given. I show this only as example before the other tasks. We can easily find $a=\frac{C}{2\pi}$ and then solve: $$A=2\pi rh = 2\pi r (r-\sqrt{r^2-a^2})$$ to obtain $$r=\frac{A}{2\sqrt{\pi(A-\pi a^2)}}$$ Parameters $a$ and $r$ are now known and it is straightforward to find $h$, $d$, $\theta$ and anything else. C-d Problem $C$ and $d$ are given. First step once again is easy: $a=\frac{C}{2\pi}$. The knowing of $a$ suggests that we might prefer the $\theta$ definition with the sine. We obtain: $$d=2r\theta=2r\arcsin\frac{a}{r}$$ That's where I got stuck. Is there an easy way to solve this? Is there a hard way to solve this? I tried solving numerically with Wolfram Mathematica and it went into complex numbers. When solving the geometrically equivalent $\sin\frac{d}{2r}=\frac{a}{r}$ I got some roots, but the search seemed very unstable and not finding the root closest to initial value. Besides it was finding a lot of different roots while I am pretty sure that there should only be one $r$ for each pair of $d$ and $a$. What would be the right formulation to solve this problem numerically? A-d problem $A$ and $d$ are given. This seems the hardest one. We obtain a system of equations: $$A=2\pi r h$$ $$d=2r\arccos\left(1-\frac{h}{r}\right)$$ (The first equation suggested solving the problem in $h$ and $r$). Is this system solvable analytically? Or numerically? My experiments with Wolfram Mathematica never converged. Of course, I could express $h$ or $r$ from the first equation and leave only the second in one of these forms: $$d = 2r\arccos\left(1-\frac{A}{2\pi r^2}\right)$$ $$d = \frac{A}{\pi h}\arccos\left(1-\frac{2\pi h^2}{A}\right)$$ But I have no idea how to solve these either.","Foreword This question was inspired by initial mistakes in this question .

A spherical cap is usually described by it's height $h$, radius of the base $a$ and radius of the sphere $r$. Besides we have a relation $a^2+(r-h)^2=r^2$ so the cap actually only has two degrees of freedom. When considering a case of circle on a sphere (like the Earth), it's the surface of a spherical cap, but we can't see the height or other classic parameters of this spherical cap. Instead we encounter parameters like area $A$, perimeter $C$ and diameter $d$. I will try to write formulae for these: $$A=2\pi rh$$ $$C=2\pi a$$ $$d=2r\theta$$ Where $\theta$ is introduced with $\sin\theta=\frac{a}{r}$ or $\cos\theta=(1-\frac{h}{r})$. As the cap only has two degrees of freedom, it should be a good problem with unique solution if only two values are known. A-C Problem The simple example: $A$ and $C$ are given. I show this only as example before the other tasks. We can easily find $a=\frac{C}{2\pi}$ and then solve: $$A=2\pi rh = 2\pi r (r-\sqrt{r^2-a^2})$$ to obtain $$r=\frac{A}{2\sqrt{\pi(A-\pi a^2)}}$$ Parameters $a$ and $r$ are now known and it is straightforward to find $h$, $d$, $\theta$ and anything else. C-d Problem $C$ and $d$ are given. First step once again is easy: $a=\frac{C}{2\pi}$. The knowing of $a$ suggests that we might prefer the $\theta$ definition with the sine. We obtain: $$d=2r\theta=2r\arcsin\frac{a}{r}$$ That's where I got stuck. Is there an easy way to solve this? Is there a hard way to solve this? I tried solving numerically with Wolfram Mathematica and it went into complex numbers. When solving the geometrically equivalent $\sin\frac{d}{2r}=\frac{a}{r}$ I got some roots, but the search seemed very unstable and not finding the root closest to initial value. Besides it was finding a lot of different roots while I am pretty sure that there should only be one $r$ for each pair of $d$ and $a$. What would be the right formulation to solve this problem numerically? A-d problem $A$ and $d$ are given. This seems the hardest one. We obtain a system of equations: $$A=2\pi r h$$ $$d=2r\arccos\left(1-\frac{h}{r}\right)$$ (The first equation suggested solving the problem in $h$ and $r$). Is this system solvable analytically? Or numerically? My experiments with Wolfram Mathematica never converged. Of course, I could express $h$ or $r$ from the first equation and leave only the second in one of these forms: $$d = 2r\arccos\left(1-\frac{A}{2\pi r^2}\right)$$ $$d = \frac{A}{\pi h}\arccos\left(1-\frac{2\pi h^2}{A}\right)$$ But I have no idea how to solve these either.",,"['geometry', 'trigonometry', 'spherical-geometry']"

39,Which proportions of areas can be formed by circles in the plane?,Which proportions of areas can be formed by circles in the plane?,,"Consider two circles in the plane, one red and one blue with a purple intersection. $\hskip2.5in$ The proportion of the area in the plane that is occupied by each color can be seen as a point on the 3-simplex if we say that each triple is (Red Area, Blue Area, Purple Area). The illustration above would correspond to some point close to (0.14, 0.84, 0.02). All points on the 3-simplex can be realized by circles in this way. If we think of this as a function, $f_2 : X^2 \rightarrow \triangle^3$ (where $X$ is some parameterization of circles), then we would say that it's surjective. If we now add a green circle to the plane we would be able to form 7 different colors. $\hskip2.5in$ And now we get a new function, $f_3 : X^3 \rightarrow \triangle^7$ . The difference is that this function isn't surjective. For example: consider a configuration where we only see yellow, purple and cyan, all having an area of $1/3$ each. If we let $F_3$ be the fraction of points on the simplex that are in the image of $f_3$ then we can ask ourselves: what is the value of $F_3$ ? This can of course be generalized to more circles with $f_n : X^n \rightarrow \triangle^{2^n-1}$ and $F_n$ defined similarly. In that case we can easily prove that $F_n \leq F_{n-1}$ by considering the restrictions on all circles but one and then adding the last one. We can also prove the stronger statement that $$     F_n \leq \min(\{F_p^{\lfloor n/p \rfloor} \mid 1 < p < n\}) $$ This can be proved by splitting the circles into groups of size $p$ and using the fact that if one of the groups can't be formed then the whole configuration can't be formed. A corollary of this is that $$ (\exists n.  F_n \neq 1) \implies \left(\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} F_n=0\right) $$ But this argument doesn't construct the value of any $F_n$ . So my questions are What is the value of $F_3$ ? What about for higher $n$ ?

40,Finding the image in an elliptic mirror,Finding the image in an elliptic mirror,,"I'm trying to find the location of the image of a point being reflected by a mirror shaped like (half of an) ellipse. The goal is to find a transformation $\mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ which sends each point on one side of the ellipse to the location of its mirror image point on the other side. (Points on the boundary of the ellipse remain fixed.) Previously, I've successfully found this transformation for parabolic mirror. The transformation is $$\widehat{x} = \frac{1+\sin{\alpha}}{\cos{\alpha}}\\ \widehat{\alpha} = \frac{1/4x^2-f}{x}$$ which you can prove using the following diagram. The coordinate system is chosen to take advantage of the parabola's reflective property: it sends vertical lines to lines through the focus and vice-versa; this is evident in the way that $\widehat{x}$ only depends on $\alpha$ and $\widehat{\alpha}$ only depends on $x$ . I thought it would be similarly straightforward to compute this transformation for an ellipse. I expected that here a convenient choice of coordinate system would be the angle formed between the target point and each focus—but when I attempt to use the ellipse's reflective property (rays from one focus reflect into the other focus) and solve for the location of the image point, I get increasingly hairy math involving quadratic equations (where the ray from one focus toward the point intersects the boundary of the ellipse) and nothing seems to simplify. I expected elegance similar to the parabola—am I taking a wrong approach somehow? (And if not, what's the explanation for the difference?) Edit: I did find another almost-convenient coordinate system $\langle \theta_1, \theta_2\rangle$ ; for a given point, to compute $\theta$ , draw a ray from the point to one focus. Find the point where the ray intersects the ellipse. The angle between that intersection point and the origin is $\theta$ . Doing so for both foci gives two angles. By the reflection property of the ellipse, the reflection map simply exchanges the angles $\theta_1 \leftrightarrow \theta_2$ . This is mathematically simple, but unsatisfying to me for a few reasons. First, the angles $\theta$ seem unnatural because they involve computing a point of intersection, which feels like a complicated intermediate variable. (I wish we could solve in terms of more natural-seeming parameters such as the angles between the foci and the point— which might still be difficult, because there are many confocal ellipses and so some intersection with the boundary must be involved somewhere.) Second, it doesn't seem to obviously relate to the formula I got for the parabola, whereas I would expect the parabola formula to emerge as an extreme limiting case of the ellipse.","I'm trying to find the location of the image of a point being reflected by a mirror shaped like (half of an) ellipse.

42,How can we formalize Jorge Luis Borges' Aleph?,How can we formalize Jorge Luis Borges' Aleph?,,"Background. Jorge Luis Borges was a post-modern short-story writer of the 20th century, whose stories often invoke a healthy dose of surrealism. One of his works is called The Aleph . In this book, there exists a point in space, aptly called the Aleph, that contains all other points. Anyone who gazes into it can see everything in the universe from every angle simultaneously, without distortion, overlapping, or confusion. I quote: All language is a set of symbols whose use among its speakers assumes a shared past. How, then, can I translate into words the limitless Aleph, which my floundering mind can scarcely encompass? Mystics, faced with the same problem, fall back on symbols: to signify the godhead, one Persian speaks of a bird that somehow is all birds; Alanus de Insulis, of a sphere whose center is everywhere and circumference is nowhere; Ezekiel, of a four-faced angel who at one and the same time moves east and west, north and south. (Not in vain do I recall these inconceivable analogies; they bear some relation to the Aleph.) Perhaps the gods might grant me a similar metaphor, but then this account would become contaminated by literature, by fiction. Really, what I want to do is impossible, for any listing of an endless series is doomed to be infinitesimal. In that single gigantic instant I saw millions of acts both delightful and awful; not one of them occupied the same point in space, without overlapping or    transparency. What my eyes beheld was simultaneous, but what I shall now write down will be successive, because language is successive. Nonetheless, I’ll try to recollect what I can. On the back part of the step, toward the right, I saw a small iridescent sphere of almost unbearable brilliance. At first I thought it was revolving; then I realised that this movement was an illusion created by the dizzying world it bounded. The Aleph’s diameter was probably little more than an inch, but all space was there, actual and undiminished. Each thing (a mirror’s face, let us say) was infinite things, since I distinctly saw it from every angle of the universe. I saw the teeming sea; I saw daybreak and nightfall; I saw the multitudes of America; I saw   a silvery cobweb in the center of a black pyramid; (...) I saw the coupling of love and the modification of death; I saw the Aleph from   every point and angle, and in the Aleph I saw the earth and in the earth the Aleph and in the Aleph the earth; I saw my own face and my own bowels; I saw your face; and I felt dizzy and wept, for my eyes had seen that secret and conjectured object whose name is common to all men but which no man has looked upon --- the unimaginable universe. I felt infinite wonder, infinite pity. Question. How can we put the concept of The Aleph on a solid mathematical footing? What I tried. To simplify discussion, let's forget about time, and start with a Riemannian $3$ -manifold (whether it's compact I'll leave to the cosmologist) $M$ , which serves as a model for our universe. Let us model The Aleph as an additional point $\aleph$ . A priori it is not connected to the universe; however, we may endow $M \cup \{\aleph\}$ with a topology extending the one on $M$ that has, as its only neighbourhood of $\aleph$ , the entire space. Topologically speaking, this implies that $\aleph$ is 'near every other point'. Upon doing this, however, our space is no longer Riemannian, and as such, much of the relevant notions, such as geodesics, start breaking down. So I'm not sure if this could get us any further. This also does not take into account relativity in any serious way. I am vaguely aware that general relativity views the universe as a Lorentzian $4$ -manifold such that light curves travel along suitable null-geodesics, but I am otherwise unfamiliar with the details; thus to prevent me from saying anything stupid I'll leave it at this.","Background.

As it's easier to prove anything on Delaunay triangulation by referencing Voronoi diagrams I tried that method - with no good results. Theorem above is a bit more than this, but it seems to work (used visualization software to check it and couldn't create counterexample). EDIT: Here are examples. As you can see, without losing a generality, we choose $AB$ edge and draw circle such that $AB$ is its diameter. Now this circle is always inside union of ellipses.

76,"What are ""shapes"" and/or the polynomials associated to them really called?","What are ""shapes"" and/or the polynomials associated to them really called?",,"While trying to formalize basic Year 8 geometry, I came up with the following: Definition 0. A shape is a CW-complex $S$ together with a topological embedding $f_S:S \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ such that for all natural numbers $n$, writing $S_n$ for the union of the $n$-dimensional cells of $S$, we have that $f_S(S_n)$ has finite $n$-dimensional measure. Two shapes are equal iff there exists a proper rigid transformation that turns one shape into the other. Examples. The line segment of length $a$, the $(a\times b)$-rectangle, the circle of radius $r$, the two-dimensional disk of radius $r$, etc. We can also take cartesian products of shapes; for example, the $a\times b$-rectangle can be expressed as the cartesian product of a line segment of length $a$ and another of length $b$. Similarly, we can get the cylinder by taking the cartesian product of a circle and a line segment. The definition of a shape is rigged so that to each shape $S$, we can assign a polynomial $S(x)$ as follows. Definition 1. If $S$ is a shape, write $S(x)$ for the formal polynomial in the symbol $x$ with coefficients in $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ such that the coefficient of $x^n$ is the $n$-dimensional measure of $f_S(S_n)$. For example: If we write $[a]$ for the line segment of length $a$, then $[a](x) = 2+a x$. Notice the polynomial tells us both the number of vertexes, and the length of the interval. If $S=[a] \times [b],$ then $S$ is the rectangle of size $a \times b$. Therefore: $$S(x) = 4+(2a+2b)x+abx^2,$$ because $4$ is the number of vertexes, $2a+2b$ is the perimeter, and $ab$ is the area. If $S_r^2$ is the circle of radius $r$ (that's not filled in), then $S_r^2(x) = 2\pi rx$, because the coefficient of $x$ is the perimeter of the circle. Similarly, if $B_r^2$ is the two-dimensional ball of radius $r$, then $B_r^2(x) = 2\pi rx+\pi r^2x^2.$ The $2\pi r$ is the perimeter, and the $\pi r^2$ is the area. If $S$ is the point, then $S(x) = 1$. Now. the whole reason we want to be viewing these as polynomials (rather than just sequences) is that it seems to be a general principle that $$(S \times T)(x) = S(x) \cdot T(x).$$ We can use this to derive dot point $1$ from dot point $2$. In particular: $$([a] \times [b])(x) = [a](x) \cdot [b](x) = (2+ax)(2+bx) = 4+(2a+2b)x+abx^2.$$ Its also possible to take sums of shapes, defined by disjoint union. We have: $$(S + T)(x) = S(x)+T(x)$$ Anyway, geometry has been around for a long time. Surely I'm not the first person to have this idea, so: Question.

Improve this question I am a college student, at a community college and I am in the process of obtaining an associates degree in general science with a specialization in mathematics in hope of transferring to a university to major in electrical-computer engineering. When I first started community college about 3 years ago I entered with little no knowledge of anything(I was an extremely lazy high-school jock and a mediocre one at that), I took every introductory course basically except for in English. My first math class was learning basic arithmetic and now I am entering a Differential equations and Calculus III class next semester. Now that my background is out of the way I would like to get my question. I am looking for books to help me obtain a deeper understanding of lower level mathematics, basically everything from Pre-Calculus and down. While I know enough(of algebra, geometry, trig, precalc) to excel in the courses at my school, which I think is fair to say are watered down. I feel like at my school the courses have only touched the surface of lower level mathematics and I would like to delve deeper into them. I have done some research and think that the books I am looking for are Algebra, Trigonometry, Functions & Graphs, Method of Coordinates, Sequences-Combinations-Limits; all by Gelfand. I am also looking for books, on geometry(Now I don't know if I should find a classical Geometry book or a Euclidean Geometry book; I think the two are the same but I don't know) Also, I am looking for a book that teachers about the number system, like the difference between Real numbers and complex numbers, and how the Reals branch off between natural, rational, irrational, etc. And a book on mathematical notation would nice. Finally, I need to know what order would be best to read these books. Basically I want to know the order in which would provide the best flow or synergy with one another. I am obviously not going to buy all these books at once and this list is by no means set in stone and is subject to change. Another reason that I want to get a deeper understanding of these subjects is because I feel like my lack of depth is what hindered me in my linear algebra class this semester, I did okay overall but I had hard time because the book used a lot of notation and symbols with stuff that I didn't know. I eventually, after reading these books, is get better books for calculus, linear algebra, and discrete mathematics. Thanks.","Closed . This question needs to be more focused .
