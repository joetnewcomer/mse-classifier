In one, the function f is asked to be defined on an open interval containing the point a , possibly excluding said point ( Stewart, Wade ).

In the first definition, for the limit to exist it is necessary that x can tend to a from both sides, that is, with values greater and less than a . In the second version, since any extreme of an interval is also a limit point, x is not required to tend to a on both sides.  The latter also implies that the sided limits are particular cases of the general definition. Furthermore, the theorem which is usually stated as "" There exists the limit of f at a point a and is equal to L if and only if both sided limits exist and are equal to L "" only makes sense in that case for interior points of the domain.

So $$\lim \limits_{x \to 0}\dfrac {\tan (x)}{x} = \dfrac{\frac{d}{dx}\tan(x)}{\frac{d}{dx}x} = \dfrac{\sec^2(x)}{1} \\ \implies \lim \limits_{x \to 0}\dfrac {\tan (x)}{x} = \sec^2(0) = 1.$$ A geometrical proof of the same can be found here . I am looking for some non-geometrical proof for this identity.","I was going through a Calculus Textbook, when came across the following two identities : The first one is really popular/famous and has many proofs. But I am more interested in the second one. The fraction becomes at , so the easiest approach is the L'Hopital's Rule. So A geometrical proof of the same can be found here . I am looking for some non-geometrical proof for this identity.","\lim \limits_{x \to 0}\dfrac {\sin (x)}{x} = 1
\qquad\text{and}\qquad\lim \limits_{x \to 0}\dfrac {\tan (x)}{x} = 1. \frac {\tan (x)}{x} \frac {0}{0} x=0 \lim \limits_{x \to 0}\dfrac {\tan (x)}{x} = \dfrac{\frac{d}{dx}\tan(x)}{\frac{d}{dx}x} = \dfrac{\sec^2(x)}{1}

99,Find $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\left(\frac{-5+3n}{3n}\right)^{6n}$,Find,\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\left(\frac{-5+3n}{3n}\right)^{6n},"I want to find the limit of the following: $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(\frac{-5+3n}{3n}\right)^{6n}$$ However, although I see the quite similar structure to $\left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^n$, I do not come to a meaningful result. What is the limit?","I want to find the limit of the following: $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(\frac{-5+3n}{3n}\right)^{6n}$$ However, although I see the quite similar structure to $\left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^n$, I do not come to a meaningful result.
