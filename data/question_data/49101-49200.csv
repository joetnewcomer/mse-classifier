We want to show that $\int_a^c f(x)\ dx=0$ if and only if $b=\frac{a+c}{2}$. The first move is to horizontally shift $f$ by $b$ units, that is introduce $g(x)=f(x+b)=(x-r_1)x(x+r_2)$ with $r_1<0<r_2$. Then the statement becomes $\int_{r_1}^{r_2} g(x)\ dx=0$ if and only if $r_1=-r_2$. If $r_1=-r_2$, the result is true, since the integrand is odd.

I'd like to get rid of the $\cos{\theta}$ term in the exponential with a change of variables, but setting $u=\cos{\theta}$ is not possible because I am missing a $\sin{\theta}$ .

I can make this $\sin{\theta}$ appear if I integrate by parts, but then a $\theta$ appears as well and the change of variables $u=\cos{\theta}$ still won't work.
