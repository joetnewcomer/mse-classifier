0,Two seemingly unrelated puzzles have very similar solutions; what's the connection?,Two seemingly unrelated puzzles have very similar solutions; what's the connection?,,"I think it's an interesting coincidence that the locker puzzle and this puzzle about duplicate array entries (see problem 6b) have such similar solutions. Spoiler alert! Don't read on if you want to solve these puzzles yourself first (they're two of the best puzzles I've ever seen). In both solutions we consider a collection of labeled boxes, each with a number inside, and then ""traverse through boxes"" by starting at a given box and using the number inside to decide where to go next.  For example, we might start at box $1$, find the number $5$ inside, proceed to box $5$, find the number $2$ inside, proceed to box $2$, and so forth. Furthermore, in both solutions we ""traverse through boxes"" for the same reason: we're interested in finding cycles.  More specifically, for the locker puzzle, we're interested in the question, ""If we start at box $n$, how many steps does it take to get back to box $n$?"" , and for the duplicate array puzzle, we're interested in the question, ""Does there exist $n$ such that (1) if we start at box $1$, we will eventually get to box $n$, and (2) if we start at box $n$, we will eventually get back to box $n$?"" Since the two puzzles seem quite unrelated at first glance, I'll pose the following question: Is there a deep reason why ""traversing through boxes"" (described in the 2nd paragraph above) shows up in the solution for both of these puzzles? In addition, Are there other interesting problems for which ""traversing through boxes"", whether to find cycles or for any other reason, shows up in the solution? [Edit] I mistakenly said that for the locker puzzle, we're interested in the question, ""If we start at box $n$, will we eventually get back to box $n$?""

12,Why do we trust the Classification of Finite Simple Groups?,Why do we trust the Classification of Finite Simple Groups?,,"It seems to me there are a two main reasons to believe a theorem/conjecture to be true: Because it has a correct proof (e.g. the Feit-Thompson Theorem, Dirichlet's Theorem) Because there is an intuitive reason/heuristic for it to be true (e.g. $P \ne NP$ , Dirichlet's Theorem) The former is of course usually the gold standard. However very long proofs may still be regarded as suspicious after a proof has been produced. The longer a proof is, the more likely it is to have undiscovered errors, so that even if no specific gap is known, people don't trust that there isn't a gap. Computer verification of proofs may be used to alleviate these concerns, e.g. the Feit-Thompson theorem was verified with Coq in 2012. But it seems neither condition convincingly applies to CFSG.

However very long proofs may still be regarded as suspicious after a proof has been produced. The longer a proof is, the more likely it is to have undiscovered errors, so that even if no specific gap is known, people don't trust that there isn't a gap. Computer verification of proofs may be used to alleviate these concerns, e.g. the Feit-Thompson theorem was verified with Coq in 2012. But it seems neither condition convincingly applies to CFSG.

This proof is not incorrect, AFAICT, but it makes me wonder what's wrong with this naive 1-line proof:  If $H < G$ are groups with $[G\;:\:H\;] = 2$, then (regarding $G, H, aH$, and $Ha$ as sets ): $$aH = G - H = Ha \;,\;\;\;\forall \; a \in G - H$$ (I.e. $G = H \; \cup \; aH = H \; \cup \; Ha$, and both unions are disjoint.)

Otherwise, $ghg^{-1} = ah_1$ for some $h_1\in H$.  But $ah_1 = ghg^{-1} = ah_0hh_0^{-1}a^{-1}$.  Cancel $a$ to obtain $h_1 = h_0hh_0^{-1}a^{-1}$, contradicting $a \notin H$. The prospect of making sense of this oddly worded, belabored proof was what prodded my lazy brain into casting about for a simpler one...

I can see how to generate a cyclic subgroup of order $p-1$ (use the matrix $\left(\begin{smallmatrix}x &0\\0 &x\end{smallmatrix}\right)$, where $x \in (\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^*$ has order $p-1$) or of order $(p-1)p$ (use $\left(\begin{smallmatrix}x &1\\0 &x\end{smallmatrix}\right)$), from which it follows how to find a group whose order is any divisor of $(p-1)p$. However I'm having trouble seeing whether there's a cyclic subgroup of order $p+1$ (for example) nor how to construct it.",,"['group-theory', 'finite-groups', 'abelian-groups']"

93,Conjugation Functor from a Groupoid to $\mathbf{Grp}$,Conjugation Functor from a Groupoid to,\mathbf{Grp},"Take a groupoid $\mathcal{C} \in \mathbf{Grpd}$ . It's possible to construct a conjugation functor $F_{\mathcal{C} } : \mathcal{C} \to \mathbf{Grp}$ as follows: For every object $x \in \text{ob}(\mathcal{C})$ , $F_{\mathcal{C} }(x) = \text{Hom}_{\mathcal{C} }(x, x)$ considered as a group. This is the standard way to think of groups as one-object groupoids. For every morphism $f : x \to y$ , the corresponding group homomorphism $F_{\mathcal{C} }(f) : \text{Hom}_{\mathcal{C} }(x, x) \to \text{Hom}_{\mathcal{C} }(y, y)$ is constructed by conjugation . Specifically, $F_{\mathcal{C} }(f)(g) = f \circ g \circ f^{-1}$ for $g \in \text{Hom}_{\mathcal{C} }(x, x)$ . Here it's important that $\mathcal{C}$ is a groupoid so that $f^{-1} : y \to x$ exists (and is unique). This can be verified to be a functor. But there's more. Take a groupoid morphism $G : \mathcal{C}_1 \to \mathcal{C}_2$ between two groupoids in $\mathbf{Grpd}$ . It turns out that there always exists a natural transformation $\eta^G : F_{\mathcal{C}_1} \to F_{\mathcal{C}_2} \circ G$ . This is constructed by seeing that $G$ turns $\text{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}_1}(x, x)$ into a subset of $\text{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}_2} (G(x), G(x))$ , and $G$ being a groupoid morphism (so a functor between $\mathcal{C}_1$ and $\mathcal{C}_2$ ) means that this is a group homomorphism. And it turns out this group homomorphism makes the appropriate diagrams for a natural transformation commute. Furthermore, these natural transformations ""play nicely with each other"", in the sense that if $G : \mathcal{C}_1 \to \mathcal{C}_2$ and $H : \mathcal{C}_2 \to \mathcal{C}_3$ are groupoid morphisms, then $\eta^{H \circ G} = (\eta^H G) \circ \eta^G$ , the composition of the natural transformations (using whiskering). This kind of looks like the chain rule. My question is - what sort of object is $F$ ? Is there some category-theoretic name for it? I tried looking into 2-categories. $\mathbf{Cat}$ is the prototypical example - here, objects are categories, morphisms are functors, and 2-morphisms are natural transformations. $\mathbf{Grpd}$ works naturally as a subcategory of this. But in a sense, I want something ""1 level down"" - the objects here aren't really the groupoids, but the objects of the groupoids . The morphisms are just the morphisms within the groupoids, and the 2-morphisms would be the functors between groupoids. The natural transformations between functors don't really show up here. So I'm not sure if this is related to 2-categories or not. EDIT: As suggested by @ZachGoldthorpe, I'll put some details of why I wanted to use $F$ . The fundamental groupoid can be shown to work as a functor $\pi_1 : \mathbf{Top} \to \mathbf{Grpd}$ , which sends a topological space $X$ to the groupoid $\pi_1(X)$ , where: The objects of $\pi_1(X)$ are pairs $(X, x_0)$ for a point $x_0 \in X$ The morphisms of $\pi_1(X)$ are homotopy classes of paths $[\gamma] : (X, x_0) \to (X, x_1)$ for $\gamma$ a path connecting $x_0$ and $x_1$ . Morphism composition is given by path concatenation, identity morphisms are constant paths, and inverse morphisms are given by ""following the path backwards"". Additionally, it sends a continuous map $f : X \to Y$ to a functor $\pi_1(f) : \pi_1(X) \to \pi_1(Y)$ that: Takes in an object $(X, x_0) \in \text{ob}(\pi_1(X))$ and sends it to $(Y, f(x_0)) \in \text{ob}(\pi_1(Y))$ . Takes in a morphism $[\gamma] : (X, x_0) \to (X, x_1)$ and sends it to $[f \circ \gamma] : (Y, f(x_0)) \to (Y, f(x_1))$ . The usefulness of $F$ comes from applying $\pi_1$ and then $F$ : The objects $(X, x_0)$ of $\pi_1(X)$ , under $F_{\pi_1(X)}$ , become the fundamental groups $\pi_1(X, x_0)$ of $X$ with basepoint $x_0$ The morphisms $[\gamma] : (X, x_0) \to (X, x_1)$ of $\pi_1(X)$ under $F_{\pi_1(X)}$ become the isomorphisms between fundamental groups $[\gamma]_{\#} : \pi_1(X, x_0) \to \pi_1(X, x_1)$ which sends a loop $[u] \in \pi_1(X, x_0)$ to the loop $[\gamma^{-1} . u . \gamma ] \in \pi_1(X, x_1)$ . Note that path concatenation notation here means you follow $\gamma^{-1}$ first. The functors between groupoids $\pi_1(f) : \pi_1(X) \to \pi_1(Y)$ (from a continuous map $f : X \to Y$ ) become natural transformations $\eta^f$ which make the following diagrams commute: Here $u$ is a (homotopy class of) path(s) connecting $x_0$ to $x_1$ , with $f \circ u$ the corresponding path(s) connecting $f(x_0)$ and $f(x_1)$ . And $f_*$ is the usual homomorphism from $\pi_1(X, x_0)$ to $\pi_1(Y, f(x_0))$ sending a homotopy class of loops $[\gamma]$ to $[f \circ \gamma]$ . This is recognised as the diagram that relates how the group homomorphism $f_*$ between the fundamental groups of $X$ and $Y$ play with the isomorphisms between fundamental groups at different basepoints via paths connecting the basepoints. The properties of $F$ ensure that commutative squares of this type can be composed: Vertically, via composition of morphisms in $\pi_1(X), \pi_1(Y)$ combined with the fact that $F_{\pi_1(X)}, F_{\pi_1(Y)}$ are functors to $\mathbf{Grp}$ Horizontally, by the consistency condition $\eta^{H \circ G} = (\eta^H G) \circ \eta^G$ . Indeed, the ""horizontal"" composition of such commutative squares expresses the fact that the fundamental group functor $\pi_1 : \mathbf{Top}^* \to \mathbf{Grp}$ sending a pointed topological space $(X, x_0)$ to $\pi_1(X, x_0)$ works as a functor - the morphisms of $\mathbf{Top}^*$ become precisely these natural transformation morphisms. In a sense, the fundamental group functor only cares about the ""top edge"" of the commutative square, and doesn't a priori know about the compatibility with paths.","Take a groupoid . It's possible to construct a conjugation functor as follows: For every object , considered as a group. This is the standard way to think of groups as one-object groupoids. For every morphism , the corresponding group homomorphism is constructed by conjugation . Specifically, for . Here it's important that is a groupoid so that exists (and is unique). This can be verified to be a functor. But there's more. Take a groupoid morphism between two groupoids in . It turns out that there always exists a natural transformation . This is constructed by seeing that turns into a subset of , and being a groupoid morphism (so a functor between and ) means that this is a group homomorphism. And it turns out this group homomorphism makes the appropriate diagrams for a natural transformation commute. Furthermore, these natural transformations ""play nicely with each other"", in the sense that if and are groupoid morphisms, then , the composition of the natural transformations (using whiskering). This kind of looks like the chain rule. My question is - what sort of object is ? Is there some category-theoretic name for it? I tried looking into 2-categories. is the prototypical example - here, objects are categories, morphisms are functors, and 2-morphisms are natural transformations. works naturally as a subcategory of this. But in a sense, I want something ""1 level down"" - the objects here aren't really the groupoids, but the objects of the groupoids . The morphisms are just the morphisms within the groupoids, and the 2-morphisms would be the functors between groupoids. The natural transformations between functors don't really show up here. So I'm not sure if this is related to 2-categories or not. EDIT: As suggested by @ZachGoldthorpe, I'll put some details of why I wanted to use . The fundamental groupoid can be shown to work as a functor , which sends a topological space to the groupoid , where: The objects of are pairs for a point The morphisms of are homotopy classes of paths for a path connecting and . Morphism composition is given by path concatenation, identity morphisms are constant paths, and inverse morphisms are given by ""following the path backwards"".

It is possible for distinct monic polynomials over $\mathbb{Z}$ to have the same splitting field. For example $f = x^4 - 2$ and $g= x^4+2$ both have splitting field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[\leftroot{-2}\uproot{2}4]{2}, i)$ . Here $f,g$ are both irreducible with equal degrees. Another example is $f=x^n - 1$ and $g=\Phi_n(x)$ , the $n$ 'th cyclotomic polynomial. The splitting field of both is the $n$ 'th cyclotomic field. In this case, $g$ is irreducible and divides $f$ . The degree of $g$ is of course $\varphi(n)$ . Question: Suppose $f,g$ are monic and irreducible, with coprime degrees. Say $\deg f = n$ and $\deg g = k$ . Let us write $K_f$ and $K_g$ for their splitting fields. Is it possible for these splitting fields to coincide, $K_f = K_g$ ? I am particularly interested in the case $k=n-1$ . I have attempted to approach the question using group theory. If we write $G$ for their common Galois group, then via the action of $G$ on the roots of $f$ and $g$ respectively, we would realize $G$ as a transitive subgroup of both $S_n$ and $S_k$ . Therefore, as $k$ and $n$ are coprime $nk \mid |G|$ . $|G| \leq k!$ $[S_n : G] \geq n(n-1)\cdots(k+1)$ . Furthermore, if $\alpha$ is a root of $f$ and $\beta$ is a root of $g$ , then their stabilizers $Stab(\alpha)$ and $Stab(\beta)$ are subgroups of index $n$ and $k$ respectively. As these are coprime by assumption we would have $G = Stab(\alpha)Stab(\beta)$ . My conjecture is that this is not possible, but I am not able to show it. I seem to remember that, if $l < q$ then $S_l$ is never a transitive subgroup of $S_q$ , except the case $S_5 \leq S_6$ . Here $S_5$ acts transitively on it's $5$ -Sylow subgroups by conjugation, and there are $6$ of them. However, I might be wrong as I am unable to recover a reference for this. Of course, if this was true, we would simply strengthen 2. and 3. above to strict inequalities, unless $n=6$ and $k=5$ .
