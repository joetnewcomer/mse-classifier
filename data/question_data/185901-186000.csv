Consider a function $\phi: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ , a positive integer $m$ and suppose that there exists functions $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb R_{\geq 0}$ and $g:A \subseteq \mathbb R \to \mathbb N$ so that: $f(n) \leq \phi (n)$ for all $n \in \mathbb N$ , $g$ is increasing, and $f(\mathbb N) \subseteq A$ so that $g \circ f=id_{\mathbb N \to \mathbb N}$ . Then the equation $\phi (x)=m$ $(\ast)$ has finitely many solutions over $\mathbb N$ . Proof . Consider $\cal L_m \subseteq \mathbb N$ the set of all solutions of $(\ast)$ and assume by way of contradiction that $\cal L_m$ is infinite. Now, take $x \in \cal L_m$ .

My question is this: Is there any other function satisfying this property other than functions of the form $f(x) = a \log x + b$ ? My suspicion is that the answer is no, but I don't know how to prove it. I will explain my idea so far: Note that the above condition requires $f$ to be strictly increasing.

Based on my observations on some functions, it seems that the intervals $I_1, I_2, I_3, \ldots$ do not get smaller fast enough, so that there will eventually be overlap between $I_x$ and $I_{x+1}$ for large enough $x$ . (One function that I tested is $f(x) = \log x + \varepsilon \sin x$ where $\varepsilon$ is a small number like $\varepsilon = 0.01$ .) However, I haven't been able to prove this observation. I did find some relationship between $g_x$ and $g_{x+1}$ but it's not a strong enough relationship: $$g_{x+1}(a) - g_{x+1}\left(\frac{x-1}{x} \cdot a\right) = g_x\left(\frac{x+1}{x} \cdot a\right) - g_x(a).$$ So, is my suspicion true that the only functions satisfying the above property have the form $f(x) = a\log x + b$ ?

Definition 1.

We shall say a certain property of functions or a certain relation between functions holds ultimately over a given base $\mathcal{B}$ if there exists $B\in \mathcal{B}$ on which it holds.

45,"Discussion of Example 2, section 7 on page 45 of Munkres’ Topology.","Discussion of Example 2, section 7 on page 45 of Munkres’ Topology.",,"In Example 2, section 7 on page 45 of Munkres’ Topology, the problem is stated as follows. $$\mathbb{Z}_+\times\mathbb{Z}_+ \text{ is countably infinite.}$$ First, he defines a function $f:\mathbb{Z}_+\times\mathbb{Z}_+\rightarrow A$ , where $A$ the subset of $\mathbb{Z}_+\times\mathbb{Z}_+$ consisting of pairs $(x,y)$ for which $y\le x$ by the equation $$f\left(x,y\right)=(x+y-1,y),$$ and he defines a function $g:A\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}_+$ by the formula $g\left(x,y\right)=\frac{1}{2}\left(x-1\right)x+y$ . Then he leaves it to the reader to show that $f$ and $g$ are bijections. Though there is a similar question, unfortunately, it isn’t in detail. So I have attempted a detail one. The following is my attempt to proof of bijections. Let $f\left(x,y\right)=\left(x^\prime,y^\prime\right)$ . If $x=1$ , then $f\left(1,y\right)=(y,y)$ ; hence $y^\prime=x^\prime$ . If $x>1$ , then $x-1>0$ and $x+y-1>y$ . So $y^\prime<x^\prime$ . Thus, $\forall\left(x,y\right),\ f\left(x,y\right)\in A$ . Let $f\left(x_1,\ y_1\right)=f(x_2,y_2)$ . Then $\left(x_1+y_1-1,y_1\right)=(x_2+y_2-1,y_2)$ implying that $y_1=y_2$ ; and hence $x_1=x_2$ . Thus, $f\left(x_1,\ y_1\right)=f\left(x_2,y_2\right)\Longrightarrow\left(x_1,y_1\right)=(x_2,y_2)$ . So, $f$ is injective. Let $x^\prime,y^\prime$ be given point in $A$ . Since $y^\prime\le x^\prime$ , there exists a positive integer $x \in \mathbb{Z}_+$ such that $$ x^\prime+1=x+y^\prime, \text{ i.e.}, x^\prime=x+y^\prime-1.$$ Therefore, for every $(x^\prime,y^\prime)\in\ A$ , there exists $(x,y) \in \mathbb{Z}_+\times\mathbb{Z}_+$ such that $f(x,y)=(x^\prime,y^\prime).$ Hence $f$ is surjective; and hence bijective. Next consider the function $g:A\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}_+$ . Since $A\subset\mathbb{Z}_+\times\mathbb{Z}_+$ , it is clear that $\forall\left(x,y\right)\in A,\ g\left(x,y\right)=\frac{1}{2}\left(x-1\right)x+y\in\mathbb{Z}_+$ for $2\ |\ (x-1)x$ . Suppose $\left(x_1,y_1\right)\neq\left(x_2,y_2\right)$ . Clearly we have $y_1\le x_1,\ \ y_2\le x_2$ . If $x_1=x_2$ , then $y_1\neq y_2$ and vice-versa. In these cases, $\frac{1}{2}\left(x_1-1\right)x_1+y_1\neq\frac{1}{2}\left(x_2-1\right)x_2+y_2$ . If $x_1=y_2$ , then $x_2>y_2=x_1>y_1$ and vice-versa. In these cases, $\frac{1}{2}\left(x_1-1\right)x_1+y_1=\frac{1}{2}\left(y_2-1\right)y_2+y_1<\frac{1}{2}\left(x_2-1\right)x_2+y_2$ and vice-versa. Hence, in either case, it is clear that $\left(x_1,y_1\right)\neq\left(x_2,y_2\right)\Longrightarrow g\left(x_1,y_1\right)\neq g(x_2,y_2)$ . That is, $g\left(x_1,\ y_1\right)=g\left(x_2,y_2\right)\Longrightarrow\left(x_1,y_1\right)=\left(x_2,y_2\right)$ . Thus, g is injective. Let $z$ be given point in $\mathbb{Z}_+$ . We can choose $x$ in $\mathbb{Z}_+$ such that $2z \le (x+1)x$ . Then, $2z \le (x+1)x \implies \left(x-1\right)x+2y \le (x+1)x \implies y\le x$ . Thus, we can choose $(x,y)\in A$ for which $y\le x$ such that $2z=\left(x-1\right)x+2y$ . Therefore, for every $z\in\mathbb{Z}_+$ , there exists $\left(x,y\right)\in A$ for which $y\le x$ such that $g\left(x,y\right)=z.$ Hence $g$ is surjective; and hence bijective. It follows that $g\circ f:\mathbb{Z}_+\times\mathbb{Z}_+\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}_+$ is bijective. Hence $\mathbb{Z}_+\times\mathbb{Z}_+$ is countably infinite.∎ I wonder if my attempt is valid or not, if not, please suggest me.","In Example 2, section 7 on page 45 of Munkres’ Topology, the problem is stated as follows.

52,Is there a simpler proof for this basic fact about concave functions?,Is there a simpler proof for this basic fact about concave functions?,,"Consider a function $f \colon[0, 1] \rightarrow [0, 1]$ . Suppose that $f$ is continuous, strictly increasing, strictly concave on $[0, c]$ where $c \in (0, 1)$ , strictly convex on $[c, 1]$ , and has three fixed points: $x = 0$ , $x = \hat{x} \in (0, 1)$ and $x = 1$ . I want to prove that $f(x) > x$ for $x \in (0, \hat{x})$ (i.e. $f$ is always above the 45 degree line between zero and the interior fixed point). However, my proof seems a bit convoluted. Is there any easier way to see this? Here is my proof: First case: suppose that $c \geq \hat{x}$ . Then $f$ is concave over the full interval $[0, \hat{x}]$ . One may then confirm that $f(x) > x$ for all $[0, \hat{x}]$ as claimed (I will skip details). Second case: suppose that $c < \hat{x}$ . Then it remains true that $f(x) > x$ for all $x \in [0, c]$ . In particular, $f(c) > c$ . Furthermore, if there existed some $x' \in (c, \hat{x})$ such that $f(x') \leq x'$ , then either $f(x') = x'$ (impossible since $\hat{x}$ is the only interior fixed point) or else $f(x') < x'$ . But if $f(x') < x'$ , there would need to exist some $x'' \in (z, x')$ such that $f(x'') = x''$ (by the intermediate value theorem); which is again impossible since $\hat{x}$ is the only interior fixed point. Either way, then, we conclude that $f(x) > x$ for all $x \in (0, \hat{x})$ . As I say, it's a bit convoluted! Is there an easier way? The intuitive idea is that $f$ starts out above the 45 degree line. Also, it is a continuous function and has exactly one fixed point. So it must be above the fixed point to the left of it.","Consider a function .

70,How to determine if a function is bounded?,How to determine if a function is bounded?,,"I'm in college calc class, so please keep explanations simple. Let $g(t)=\sqrt{1-\frac{1}{t+1}}$ . I've established its domain to be $(-\infty,-1) \cup [0,\infty)$ . I'm not sure how to go about determining boundedness, please provide feedback on my method below. My understanding is that a function is unbounded if it can output arbitrarily large positive or negative values. My strategy has been to look at what happens to the function when x is close to the edges of the domain. For example if $x=-1.01$ then $\frac{1}{t+1}$ becomes a ""large negative value"" -10 and thus the whole function becomes $\sqrt{1-{LargeNegativeNumber}}$ and thus on the whole we get $\sqrt{LargePositiveNumber}$ which is unbounded upwards (in the positive y direction). If we look at another edge of the domain, $ -\infty $ , we see that $\frac{1}{-\infty+1}$ becomes a small negative value. Thus the whole function becomes $\sqrt{1-{SmallNegativeNumber}}$ thus it approaches $1$ from above. (This dcheck doesn't alter our understanding of whether g is bounded or not, right?) Ok let's go on to looking at values close to 0, say $x = 0.01$ . In that case $\frac{1}{0.01+1}$ becomes a ""large negative value"" and the whole function becomes $\sqrt{1-{LargeNegativeNumber}}$ and thus $\sqrt{LargePositiveNumber}$ . Ok this confirms our understanding that g is unbounded upwards in the positive y direction. Ok then I look at what ahppens to the function when $x = \infty$ . We see that $\frac{1}{\infty+1}$ becomes a ""small positive number"" and thus the whole function becomes $\sqrt{1-{SmallPositiveNumber}}$ and thus 1 approached from below. My conclusion is that the function is unbounded upwards, but the answer says it's just ""not bound"" which I assume means unbounded upwards and downwards, but I've failed to show unboundedness downwards! What did I do erroneously?","I'm in college calc class, so please keep explanations simple. Let . I've established its domain to be .

My understanding is that a function is unbounded if it can output arbitrarily large positive or negative values. My strategy has been to look at what happens to the function when x is close to the edges of the domain. For example if then becomes a ""large negative value"" -10 and thus the whole function becomes and thus on the whole we get which is unbounded upwards (in the positive y direction). If we look at another edge of the domain, , we see that becomes a small negative value. Thus the whole function becomes thus it approaches from above. (This dcheck doesn't alter our understanding of whether g is bounded or not, right?) Ok let's go on to looking at values close to 0, say . In that case becomes a ""large negative value"" and the whole function becomes and thus . Ok this confirms our understanding that g is unbounded upwards in the positive y direction. Ok then I look at what ahppens to the function when . We see that becomes a ""small positive number"" and thus the whole function becomes and thus 1 approached from below. My conclusion is that the function is unbounded upwards, but the answer says it's just ""not bound"" which I assume means unbounded upwards and downwards, but I've failed to show unboundedness downwards!

So $ f ( r ) = - f ( - r ) $ for every real $ r $ . $ f $ satisfies the Cauchy functional equation: From the previous items, it's easy to see that $ f ( x + a ) = f ( x ) + f ( a ) $ and $ f ( x - a ) = f ( x ) + f ( - a ) $ for all non-negative reals $ a $ and all reals $ x $ . $ f $ is increasing or $ f \equiv 0 $ : Suppose that $ 0 $ is not the only solution of $ f ( x ) = 0 $ and thus $ f ( \epsilon ) = 0 $ for some $ \epsilon > 0 $ . from $ f $ satisfying the Cauchy equation we have that $ f ( q ) = f ( 1 ) q $ for any rational $ q $ . In addition, $ f \left( 1 ^ 2 \right) = f ( 1 ) ^ 2 $ , so that $ f ( 1 ) = 1 $ or $ f ( 1 ) = 0 $ . If $ f ( 1 ) = 0 $ we have $ f ( q ) = 0 $ for all rational $ q $ , and this with the condition of being non-decreasing would guarantee that $ f ( x ) = 0 $ for all real $ x $ .

Both are defined over sets, but no-one seems to have any problem defining functions on the ordinals like Hartog's function giving the minimum ordinal that doesn't have an injective function on to the given ordinal. I know we want to be able to obviously, but how are we supposed to justify this, because the definitions of functions don't seem to include classes.

While I study about composition of waves, I have one question - can we say that the composed wave has infinitely many '0-displacement points'? In formally, let the function $f(x)$ defined as below, while $n \in \mathbb{N}$ is the given constant. $f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}{a_i \sin(b_i x + c_i)}$ To make clear statement, let's assume that sequence $\{a_i\}$ doesn't contain any 0. Also, $f(x)$ is not always zero - for example, if $\{a_i\} = \{2, 1, 1\}, \{b_i\} = \{1, 1, 1\}, \{ c_i \} = \{\pi, 0, 0\}$ , $f(x) = 2\sin(x+\pi) + \sin(x) + \sin(x)=0$ always.

95,Is the Ratio of Associative Binary Operations to All Binary Operations on a Set of $n$ Elements Generally Small?,Is the Ratio of Associative Binary Operations to All Binary Operations on a Set of  Elements Generally Small?,n,"I started thinking about the number of associative (binary) operations on a set with $n$ elements today.  Looking online I found this paper which indicates only $113$ of the possible $19,683$ operations on a three-element set satisfy association.  So, $50\%$ of binary operations on a two-element set satisfy association, and less than $0.6\%$ of all binary operations on a three element set satisfy association.  For an $n$-element set, where $n$ denotes a natural number, is the ratio $R_{n}=A_{n}/B_{n}$, of the number of associative binary operations $A_{n}$ to the number of all binary operations $B_{n}$, in general small?  I don't mean the following questions as equivalent, but since they seem more concretely answerable in principle, does $$ \lim_{n \to +\infty} \frac{A_{n}}{B_{n}} = 0 ? $$ Also, is $F : n \to R_{n}$ a monotonically decreasing function? Some Background of the Question: In his Linear Algebra Problem Book 1995 on p. 6 Paul Halmos writes ""The commonly accepted attitudes toward the commutative law and the associative law are different.  Many real life operations fail to commute; the mathematical community has learned to live with that fact and even to enjoy it.  Violations of the associative law, on the other hand, are usually considered by specialists only.""  For all I know, Halmos might only have written that to motivate the study of Linear Algebra and doesn't quite literally mean what he appears to say.  But, if he means what he appears to say, and if $F : n \to R_{n}$ is monotonically decreasing, or $R_{n}$ is generally small, I think there's something amiss with what Halmos says, since non-associative operations seem so common that one may as well enjoy them.","I started thinking about the number of associative (binary) operations on a set with $n$ elements today.

But, if he means what he appears to say, and if $F : n \to R_{n}$ is monotonically decreasing, or $R_{n}$ is generally small, I think there's something amiss with what Halmos says, since non-associative operations seem so common that one may as well enjoy them.",,"['combinatorics', 'abstract-algebra', 'analysis']"

97,What does the second derivative of the log transform of a function tell us about the original function?,What does the second derivative of the log transform of a function tell us about the original function?,,"In the current COVID19 crisis it has become more sensible to plot the mortality in log base 2 given the steep exponential growth with doubling times of 2 days. Recently, there has been a flattening of this log-linear plots in Italy and Spain. This is the second derivative of the log transform of the original function (which is bound to be logistic) is negative, but decreasing in absolute value. Yet, these changes are still not quite apparent in the initial plot: What is the mathematically precise interpretation of this change in the second derivative of the log transform of the data (we can assume a logistic curve)? Is the overlap in tendency as x increases just a product of the monotonicity of the function and its log transform? I don't have an elegant way of explaining this to myself, but simulating a logistic curve plateau-ing at $50$ cases in the course of $10$ days, makes it apparent the the binary log transform reaches a plateau earlier than the original function. Also, this point of deceleration in the log transform, corresponding to day $5,$ is the minimal negative value of the second derivative, and corresponds to the zero value of the second derivative of the original function, i.e. the middle of the straight part of the sigmoid curve. The critical value of the second derivative of the log transform (day $3$ ) seems to coincide with the initial deviation of the sigmoid (logistic) growth from a purely exponential: The plots are starting to show a similar shape with an incipient slow down in the number of deaths in Italy lagging behind the early indicator of a deceleration in the binary log of the number of cases: There are a slew of epidemiological factors (clustering, isolation measures, use of PPE, uneven testing, ICU occupancy/overload, treatment improvements, etc) that make any extrapolation from the ""back-of-the-envelop"" first plot to the actual numbers fraught with pitfalls. The area of maximal curvature in the log-linear plot in the actual curves in Italy is extremely subjective to pinpoint: notice the noise in the vector of second differences: Around March 11 the biggest second differences were noted with a large peak surrounded by two dips, which suggest an accounting problem, rather than signaling a position slightly past the brown vertical line on the first plot. Around March 25, which was some 20 days after the start of the accelerated phase of the epidemic there possibly lies a deceleration, which has already been noted in the news. But if this corresponds to the asymptotic tendency to zero in the second derivative of the log transform (first plot in blue), guessing at which point the nadir was reached in this second derivative of the log transform is anybody's guess. There is, however, a suggestion that the sigmoid curve is starting to show its exponential decrease (left half of the second plot in blue). Please note that the question is about the relationship of the derivatives of the log transform and the original logistic curve - It is not about fitting the data to a specific function , which is a fool's errand as beautifully illustrated by Constance Crozier in this plot:","In the current COVID19 crisis it has become more sensible to plot the mortality in log base 2 given the steep exponential growth with doubling times of 2 days.

98,About counting the number of graphs by the maximum Degree $D$.,About counting the number of graphs by the maximum Degree .,D,"This is another way of attacking the problem that I posted on the link: What is the number of connected graphs with $n$ vertices of max. degree up to $P$? Leaving $F(x) = x + x^2 + 2x^3 + 6x^4 + 21x^5 + ...$ I noticed that there are no definitive studies in Graph Theory about counting graphs by degrees (for the maximum degree for example). There are counts of total graphs by the number of nodes, by the number of edges, and analyzes on regular graphs and sequences of degrees. An example, by the link Enumeration of Graphs with given Degree Sequence , is the asymptotic formula for the number $G_{d,n}$ of d-regular graphs on $n$ vertices with given degree sequence $d = (d,...,d)$ : $$G_{d,n} \sim \frac{(dn)!e^{-(d^2-1)/4}}{(dn/2)!2^{dn/2} \prod d_i!}$$ However, I found the sequence in OEIS: A243393 ,that represents the total of graphs with maximum degree up to 3. To my surprise there is no closed formula for the sequence! There does not seem to be an analytical formula for this problem, although it is early and unlikely to state this, as I have seen much more complex problems in mathematics be solved in a majestic way. Another way to tackle the problem would be experimental, and here's my question: Is there an efficient method to find an approximate function of the curve that represents the sequence based on the given values? Below is a table containing the total number of connected simple graphs ( $A_n$ ) with a maximum degree up to 3, and some relations between the values, represented by graphics: Note in the first graph that the function $P(n)$ oscillates around a smooth curve, with a larger oscillation for small $n$ . If the function $P(n)$ was estimated, we could obtain: $$A(n) \approx \prod_{i=2}^n P(i)$$ Note in the second graph that the difference $D(n) = P(n)-P(n-1)$ seems to oscillate around a constant $K$ . We would have $\lim \limits_{n \to \infty} D_n = K$ ? It seems that the upper and lower delimiting curves $\Phi(n)$ and $\phi(n)$ behave as positive and negative exponentials. See also in third graph that $Ln(A_n)$ seems to behave as a smooth exponential. Like this? $$ A(n) \approx  e^{e^{an + b}+ c} + d$$ Anyway, there seem to be many ways to try to approximate the function and many other relationships could be observed. What would be a good and efficient method? Could we perhaps find an asymptote for some relationship?
