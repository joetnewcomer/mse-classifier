0,Distinguishing between the square roots of a quadratic residue,Distinguishing between the square roots of a quadratic residue,,"For a prime $p$, given $g$, $x = g^{2r}\pmod p$, and $y$ such that $y^2 \equiv x \pmod p$, is it possible to determine if $y \equiv g^r \pmod p$ without calculating the discrete logarithm?

Now,let there exist positive integers $x,y$ that satisfy the given equation.Then $mx=y^2+y+1$ for some positive integer $m$ .Substituting this in the original equation yields $$x^2+x+mx=xyz$$ $$\implies x+1+m=yz$$ $$\implies \dfrac{y^2+y+1}{m}+1+m=yz$$ $$\implies y^2+y+m^2+m+1=myz$$ This equation's exactly like the equation we were trying to solve.Unfortunately,however,this does not let us use FMID since we don't know if $m<x$. The above problem is from Titu Andreescu's book on intro to diophantine equations.He does give a solution,but I was wondering if my approach could be used somehow.I am also interested in seeing other approaches.Thanks is advance.",,"['number-theory', 'elementary-number-theory', 'diophantine-equations', 'vieta-jumping']"

Factoring $p - 1$ is easy in my case, since all of my candidates are already factored for the most part (except the $a$ term), but from what I understand I need not only the prime factors but ALL factors of $p - 1$, and it seems there will always be a ton of them when $b$ is a large power of $2$.

If this post is anything to go by, I MIGHT be able to get away with testing only $k$'s containing all $864$ $2$ factors, but I could easily be wrong, since the presence of a non-$2$ factor might change things: Why 4 is not a primitive root modulo p for any prime p? . I don't know modular arithmetic though, so even if I only had to test a handful of $k$'s to obtain the order, there's no obvious way for me to calculate something as huge as $b^{(\phi(p)/k)}\mod p$ even once, when $b = 2^{32}$.

I have no real experience with analysis, so I'm not sure if my reasoning is formal enough, or correct. Any feedback would be appreciated. Let $\xi$ be an irrational number with continued fraction expansion $\langle a_0,a_1,a_2,a_3\dots\rangle$. Let $b_1,b_2,b_3,\cdots$ be any sequence of positive integers, either finite or infinte. Prove that $\lim_{n\to\infty}\langle a_0,a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n,b_1,b_2,b_3\dots\rangle=\xi$. I let $r_n=\langle a_0,a_1,\dots,a_n\rangle$ and $\xi'=\langle b_1,b_2,b_3,\dots\rangle$, and let $\beta_n=\langle a_0,a_1,a_2,a_3\dots,a_n,\xi'\rangle$. So* $$\beta_n-r_n=\beta_n-\frac{h_n}{k_n}=\frac{\xi'h_n+h_{n-1}}{\xi'k_n+k_{n-1}}-\frac{h_n}{k_n}$$ $$=\frac{-(h_nk_{n-1}-h_{n-1}k_n)}{k_n(\xi'k_n+k_{n-1})}=\frac{(-1)^n}{k_n(\xi'k_n+k_{n-1})}$$ But ${k_n}$ is a positive increasing series, $\xi'$ is a positive real number, so as $n$ approaches $\infty$, the denominator goes to $\infty$ while the numerator alternates between $-1$ and $1$, so the fraction tends to $0$. Hence we have that $\lim_{n\to\infty}(\beta_n-r_n)=0$, so $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\beta_n=\lim_{n\to\infty}r_n=\lim_{n\to\infty}\langle a_0,a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n\rangle=\langle a_0,a_1,a_2\dots\rangle=\xi.$$ Hence $\lim_{n\to\infty}\langle a_0,a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n,b_1,b_2,b_3\dots\rangle=\xi$.

Find all $x, y \in\mathbf{N}$ such that: $$9x^2+p=y^2$$ The first approach that I have tried is the following. We know that: $$(t+n)^2-t^2=t^2+2\cdot t \cdot n +n^2-t^2=2\cdot t \cdot n +n^2$$ Also, we can build every possible square $w_n$ greater than $p$ in this way: $$w_n=\left\lfloor\sqrt{p}\right\rfloor^2+2\cdot \left\lfloor\sqrt{p}\right\rfloor \cdot n +n^2 = \left(n+\left\lfloor\sqrt{p}\right\rfloor^2\right)^2$$ For example, let $p=5$ .

Now, using this idea and applying to the first equation: $$9x^2=\left(n+\left\lfloor\sqrt{p}\right\rfloor^2\right)^2-p$$ I am not allowed to apply Pell's equation because $9=3^2$ and calcultaing $\Delta$ in $x$ doesn't help anymore. Another approach is based on Pell's equation. I thought to express $9x^2=8x^2+x^2$ and then: $$8x^2+x^2+p=y^2\leftrightarrow 8x^2+p=y^2-x^2\leftrightarrow (y^2-x^2)-8x^2=p \leftrightarrow u^2-8x^2=p$$ But then, in order to generate all the solutions, I have to guess the first one (or one of them) that is pretty complicated for big $p$ .

Is it true that $$2^{2n+2}+2^{m+2}+1$$ is a perfect square if and only if $m=n$? What I have tried: Under the assumption $m<n$, I've tried to 'squeeze' the above number between two consecutive squares, implying it cannot be a perfect square. This works fine because (writing $P(m,n)=2^{2n+2}+2^{m+2}+1$), we have $(2\cdot2^n)^2<P(m,n)<(2\cdot2^n+1)^2$. But this method doesn't work when $\frac{m}{2}\leq n<m$, and I wonder if there is any pair $(m,n)$ with $m\ne n$ making $P(m,n)$ a perfect square. Any advice is welcome.","Let $m,n$ be natural numbers satisfying $m\leq 2n$. Is it true that $$2^{2n+2}+2^{m+2}+1$$ is a perfect square if and only if $m=n$?
