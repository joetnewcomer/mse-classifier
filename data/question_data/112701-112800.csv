Proof: The quotient P/P' is a primitive p-group (acting on the blocks) and so the order of P/P' = the number of blocks = p. Does p-subgroup mean the order is some power of p or p?

I am guessing when they say P' stabilizes all of the blocks, they mean stabilizes all the blocks in a minimal block system, since otherwise one could say each element is a block.  (This paper's definition of a block does not disallow one element blocks).  However, I would think that a minimal block system may not be unique.  Is such a system unique?  Maybe it is. Now, I intuitively understand that P/P' is a primitive group acting on the blocks as we are modding out by everything that stabilizes the blocks and so intuitively we are making those many stabilizing permutations the same one thing in the kernel and sort of merging the blocks into a single element in the quotient.  So, intuitively it makes sense to me.  Can someone prove it for me?  Why is the order of P/P' the number of blocks?  That makes no sense to me.  I would assume that the order of P/P' would be (the number of blocks)! since we can permute them as we please.",,"['group-theory', 'permutations', 'graph-isomorphism']"

56,Determining if a semigroup or monoid can extend to a group,Determining if a semigroup or monoid can extend to a group,,"I was thinking a few days ago, and it crossed my mind to wonder if one could extend, say, an arbitrary monoid to a group. My first thought was that it ought to be simple: Take a monoid $M$ with identity $e$, and for each $x \in M$, if there did not exist $y \in M$ such that $xy = yx = e$, define $x^{-1}$ to meet the condition; after carrying out this process, call the new object $G$. We should have an inverse element for each element of the monoid. But then I thought about it, and recalled that a group $G$ has certain properties that should be able to carry back to any sub-semigroup, e.g. properties of inverses. For example, if I have a group $G$, and there's some element $g$ such that $xg = x$ for some $x$, then $g$ is the unique identity. To see this, let $y$ be any other group element. Then we have \begin{align*} xg & = x \\ \Rightarrow (y x^{-1}) xg & = (y x^{-1}) x \\ = y g & = y , \end{align*} so $g$ is an identity element for all elements of the group. But this would mean that if there were some element $x \in G$ for which there exists $e_{x} \in G$ for which $x e_{x} = x$, but there also existed $x' \in G$ for which $x' e_{x} \neq x'$, then $G$ would not be a group. Let $X$ be some set, and define the semi-group $M = X^{2} \cup \{ \natural \}$, where $\natural \not \in X^{2}$ and $X$ contains more than one element. Define the semi-group by \begin{align*} \mathbf{a} \mathbf{b} & = \begin{cases} (a_{1}, b_{2}) , & \mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b} \in X^{2}, a_{2} = b_{1}, \\ \natural , & \textrm{otherwise} . \end{cases} \end{align*} Now let $M = S \cup \{ e \}$, where $e$ is just an affixed identity. Then $M$ is a monoid. Now assume for contradiction that $G$ is a group containing the sub-monoid $M$, and consider the element $\mathbf{a} = (a_{1}, a_{2}) \in M$. Then the element $e_{\mathbf{a}} = (a_{2}, a_{2}) \in M$ would satisfy $\mathbf{a} e_{\mathbf{a}} = \mathbf{a}$, so $e_{\mathbf{a}}$ is a right-identity for $\mathbf{a}$. If $G$ is a group, then for any element $\mathbf{b} \in G$, we'd have $\mathbf{b} e_{\mathbf{a}} = \mathbf{b}$. But if $\mathbf{b} \in X^{2} \subset M$, and $b_{2} \neq a_{2}$, then $\mathbf{b} e_{\mathbf{a}} = \natural \neq \mathbf{b}$. So $G$ is not a group, a contradiction.

I'm trying to understand to what extent the scaling condition for the linear transformation is necessary. For $\mathbb{Q}$ vector spaces, maps that preserve addition also preserves scaling.  It seems the situation is more complicated for $\mathbb{R}$.  I guess I can ""choose"" a basis of $\mathbb{R}$ as a $\mathbb{Q}$ vector space and go from there, but are there any explicit examples, preferably without using the Axiom of Choice? More generally, is there a description of the group of abelian group homomorphisms from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\mathbb{R}^m$?",,['group-theory']
