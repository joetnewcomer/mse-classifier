3,Lebesgue Convergence Theorem,Lebesgue Convergence Theorem,,"I need some clarifications about the Lebesgue Convergence theorems, I am using the book Beginning Functional Analysis by Karen Saxe and I believe that she has stated the monotone convergence theorem wrong and also made a mistake in the proof.

Let $f$ be defined to be the pointwise limit, $f(x)=\lim_{k \to \infty} f_k(x)$, of this sequence. Then $f$ is integrable and $\lim_{k \to \infty} \int_{A}f_k dm=\int_{A}f dm$. In the proof she uses the monotonicity of the Lebesgue integral to conclude that $\int_{A}f_1dm \leq \int_{A}f_2 dm\leq \dots \leq \int_{A}f dm$ and she states that $\{\int_{A}f_kdm\}_{k=1}^{\infty}$ is a bounded and non decreasing sequence of real numbers. My objections are that this sequence may NOT be assumed to be bounded since $\int_{A}f dm$ may be infinite, in fact she has stated in the theorem that she will prove it to be finite. As I would guess, please correct me and help me to clarify this, the word integrable should be changed to measurable (so that the integral is defined, this is really a separate statement, i.e. limit of measurable functions are measurable) and she should remove the word bounded from the proof and instead let the limit of this sequence be finite or infinite, the rest of the proof would then stay valid. Am I correct if I understand it like this: The monotone convergence theorem and Fatou's Lemma doesn't say anything about the integrability of the limit function only of the value of the integrals (I.e this value may be infinite).

21,Confusion about different definitions of integral in measure theory.,Confusion about different definitions of integral in measure theory.,,"I've recently noticed that the definition of the integral in my measure theory course seems to be quite different from the usual definition, in particular the one another one of my courses uses. What really confuses me though, is that it seems to have much stronger properties than it should have, going by other texts. So the definition I saw in my measure theory course notably assumes $\mu$ to be a Radon (outer!) measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$ , meaning it is Borel regular and finite on any compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ . Also, $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is assumed to be $\mu$ -measurable. We then define a simple function $g : \Omega \to \mathbb{R}^n$ to be a function of the form $$ g(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} d_i \chi_{A_i}(x) $$ for $d_i \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $A_i \subseteq \Omega$ mutually disjoint with $\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i = \Omega$ . This already is different from the usual definition of a simple function, where the sum is only finite. Then the integral of a nonnegative simple $\mu$ -measurable function $g: \Omega \to \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is defined as $$ \int_{\Omega} g \ d\mu = \begin{cases} \sum_{0 \leq y \leq \infty} y \mu(g^{-1}) \leq \infty & g < \infty \ \mu \text{-a.e.} \newline \infty & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}, $$ where $0 \cdot \infty = 0$ and the sum is well-defined since the range of a simple function is at most countable. Then we say a simple, $\mu$ -measurable function $g : \Omega\to [-\infty, \infty]$ is $\mu$ -integrable if either the integral of $g^+$ or $g^-$ in the above sense is finite. If so, then we define its integral as $$ \int_{\Omega} g \ d\mu = \int_{\Omega} g^+ \ d\mu - \int_{\Omega} g^- \ d\mu $$ given that $|g| < \infty$ almost everywhere (otherwise we set it as $\pm\infty$ if $\mu(g^{-1}\{\pm \infty\})> 0$ ). Finally, for $f : \Omega \to [-\infty, \infty]$ $\mu$ -measurable we define the upper integral as $$ \overline{\int_{\Omega}} = \inf \left\{ \int_{\Omega} g \ d\mu \mid g \text{ is } \mu \text{-integrable and simple with } g \geq f \ \mu-\text{a.e.} \right\} $$ and the lower integral as $$ \underline{\int_{\Omega}} = \sup \left\{ \int_{\Omega} g \ d\mu \mid g \text{ is } \mu \text{-integrable and simple with } g \leq f \ \mu-\text{a.e.} \right\} $$ to conclude by calling $f$ $\mu$ -integrable if the upper and the lower integrals coincide. Then the notes go on to state that any nonnegative measurable function is integrable in this sense. On the other hand, in my course on Fourier theory, there is a small recap of measure theory where the definitions are quite different. First of all, we are in the setting of classical measures and consider an arbitrary measure space $(X, \mathcal{F}, \mu)$ . Then, simple functions are defined as finite sums $$ \sum_{j=1}^n a_j \chi_{E_j}, $$ where $a_1, \dots, a_n \in \mathbb{R}$ and $E_1, \dots, E_n$ satisfy $\mu(E_i) < \infty$ . Then, we define the integral of a simple function $s$ as $$ \int_X s \ d\mu = \sum_{j=1}^n a_j \mu(E_j). $$ Next, the integral for a measurable $f : X \to [0, \infty]$ is defined as $$ \int_X f \ d\mu = \sup \left\{ \int_X s \ d \mu \mid s \text{ is simple and } s(x) \leq f(x) \text{ for all } x \in X \right\} $$ and a general measurable $f : X \to \mathbb{R}$ is called integrable if either the integral of $f^+$ or $f^-$ is finite. If it is integrable, its integral is simply defined as the difference of the integrals of $f^+$ and $f^-$ . In this definition, we didn't use the upper integral at all. After looking at some other textbooks, for example Terry Tao's Introduction to Measure Theory, it seems like there is a reason that the upper integral is not usually used in the definition. Tao uses a similar construction and claims that $f : \mathbb{R}^n \to [0, \infty]$ measurable needs to be bounded and vanishing outside a finite measure set for the upper and lower integrals to coincide. This in particular seems very different from the statement in the former construction, that said any nonnegative measurable function is ""integrable"" (where integrable means that the upper and lower integrals coincide). I'm getting lost in all the different terminology and assumptions that are made, so I can't see how the two constructions relate. Why do we require the upper and lower integrals to coincide in the first but not in the second? Does this result in a different notion of integrability? Is one stronger than the other? Does it have anything to do with the assumption that $\mu$ is Radon in the first? I have an exam on both of these classes in the summer, so I'd really appreciate any help on this. Update: It seems that the main difference comes from the fact that my measure theory course defined simple functions as countable sums (resulting in functions with countable range) while the other resources I saw define them as finite sums (resulting in functions with finite range). The former definition seems to be following the text by Evans and Gariepy while I've seen the latter definition in many other textbooks, like Tao. I think if you define the upper and lower integrals via simple functions with countable range, they match for all non-negative measurable functions. If you define them using simple functions with finite range, you get functions whose lower integral is finite but whose upper integral is infinite (an example being $e^{-x^2}$ ). At least this is the conclusion I drew from posts like this .

26,Counterexample to Egorov for functions valued in non-separable metric space,Counterexample to Egorov for functions valued in non-separable metric space,,"A general form of Egorov (e.g. https://www.ime.usp.br/~glaucio/mat6704/textos/GMTLecureNotes.pdf ) states that: Egorov Theorem : Let $\mu$ be an outer measure on the set $X$ and $(Y,d)$ a separable metric space. Consider $A\subseteq X$ with $\mu(A)<\infty$ and a sequence of measurable functions $f_n:X\to Y$ in the sense that $f_n^{-1}(U)$ is $\mu$ -measurable in $X$ for every open $U$ in $Y$ . If $\{f_n\}$ converges pointwise $\mu$ -a.e. on $A$ to a $\mu$ -measurable function $f:\mathrm{dom}(f)\subseteq X\to Y$ , then $\{f_n\}$ converges almost uniformly to $f$ on $A$ in the sense that for any $\epsilon>0$ , there is a $\mu$ -measurable set $B$ such that $\mu(A-B)<\epsilon$ and $\{f_n\}$ converges uniformly to $f$ on $B$ . Here, a set $A\subseteq X$ is called $\mu$ -measurable if it satisfies the Carathéodory condition: $\mu(T)=\mu(T\cap A) + \mu(T-A)$ for any $T\subseteq X$ . My question : is there a counterexample to Egorov Theorem without separability? That is, is there a sequence of $\mu$ -a.e. convergent functions valued in a non-separable metric space $Y$ that does not converge almost uniformly? The proof of Egorov Theorem goes the usual way by (I) defining $$C_{i,j}:= \bigcup_{n\geq j} \{x\in X: d(f_n(x),f(x))>1/i\},$$ (II) using $\mu$ -a.e. convergence to show that for each $i$ the intersection $\bigcap_{j} C_{i,j}$ has zero measure, and then (III) using $\mu(A)<\infty$ and continuity of measure to choose $J(i)$ so large for each $i$ that the exceptional set $\bigcup_i C_{i,J(i)}$ has small measure. Separability condition on $Y$ is used only in step (I) to show that the sets $C_{i,j}$ are $\mu$ -measurable. Indeed, a separable metric space $(Y,d)$ has a countable basis for its metric topology so that the Borel $\sigma$ -algebra $\mathcal{B}(Y\times Y)$ (generated by open sets in product topology on $Y\times Y$ ) coincides with the product $\sigma$ -algebra $\mathcal{B}(Y)\otimes \mathcal{B}(Y)$ . Then, the pre-image of open set $(1/i,\infty)$ in $\mathbb{R}$ under continuous map $(x,y)\mapsto d(x,y)$ is open and measurable wrt product $\sigma$ -algebra $\mathcal{B}(Y)\otimes \mathcal{B}(Y)$ , so that its pre-image $C_{i,j}$ under measurable map $x\mapsto (f_n(x),f(x))$ is measurable. I have found a counterexample to this technique , if $(Y,d)$ is not separable. For this, consider $Y$ a set with cardinality strictly larger than continuum, and $d$ the discrete metric. Then it can be shown that the diagonal $\Delta \in \mathcal{B}(Y\times Y)- \mathcal{B}(Y)\otimes \mathcal{B}(Y)$ ; this is known as the Nedoma's paradox cf. https://www.drmaciver.com/2006/04/journal-of-obscure-results-1-nedomas-pathology/ . Now put $X=Y\times Y$ and $f,g:Y\times Y\to Y$ projections onto the first and second coordinates respectively. By construction, $f,g$ are measurable, but the set $\Delta=\{(x,y)\in Y\times Y: d(f(x,y),g(x,y))<1\}$ is not measurable.

In Karatzas and Shreve, II edition, Chapter 3, we see in equation (2.2) the definition of the following measure on the product space $[0,\infty)\times\Omega$ $$ \mu_M(A) = \mathbb{E}\left[\int_0^{\infty}1_{A}(s,\omega)d\left<M\right>_s(\omega)\right] \quad (1) $$ where $M$ is a continuous square integrable martingale and $A\in\mathcal{B}([0,\infty))\otimes\mathcal{F}$ is a measurable set of the product sigma algebra. So if $t\rightarrow\left<M\right>_t(\omega)$ is absolutely continuous (for almost all $\omega\in\Omega$ ) with respect to the Lebesgue measure $\lambda$ we have that the measure in $(1)$ becomes $$ \mu_M(A) = \mathbb{E}\left[\int_0^{\infty}1_{A}(s,\omega)f(s,\omega)ds\right] = \int_{\Omega}\left(\int_0^{\infty}1_{A}(s,\omega)f(s,\omega)ds\right)d\mathbb{P}\quad (2) $$ with $f(s,\omega)\geq 0$ .

50,The canonical measure on a Riemannian manifold,The canonical measure on a Riemannian manifold,,"It seems well-known that the volume form natually induces a canonical measure on a Riemannian manifold. For example, this page mentions this fact. I am wondering the construction of such a measure. For my background, I learned some real analysis and read Tu's An Introduction to Manifolds . In Tu's book, the integral over a smooth manifold is defined for smooth forms (actually, it is no harm to extend the definition for continuous forms) via the usual Riemann integral. For an $n$ -form $\omega$ on a coordinate chart $(U,\phi)$ , the integral is defined by $$ \int_U \omega = \int_{\phi(U)} (\phi^{-1})^* \omega $$ where the right hand side is the Riemann integral. For an $n$ -form on a smooth manifold, we use an open cover of coordinate open sets and a partition of unity subordinate to the cover to define the integral of $\omega$ . For an oriented $n$ -dimensional Riemannian manifold, the volume form can be written as $$vol = \sqrt{g} dx^1 \wedge \dots \wedge dx^n$$ Then, we can use a partition of unity to define the integral of a smooth (or continuous) function via Riemann integral. In particular, the integral of a function $f$ is defined by $$ \int_M f = \int_M fvol$$ where the RHS is the integral over an $n$ -form. Here is my idea about the construction of the canonical measure $\mu$ on the Borel $\sigma$ -algebra of a Riemannian manifold $M$ . For a measurable set $V$ contained in a chart $(U,\phi)$ , since a hemeomorphism maps a Borel set to a Borel set, we can define $\mu(V)$ by setting $$ \mu(V) = \int_V vol = \int_{\phi(V)} (\phi^{-1})^* vol $$ where the RHS is now intepreted as a Lebesgue integral. Then for any Borel set $V$ , we choose an open cover consisting of coordinate open sets and a partition of unity to define $\mu(V)$ . After checking $\mu(V)$ is independent of the cover and a partition of unity, a  positive measure $\mu$ is defined so that we can talk about sets of measure zero and $L^2$ functions. Is this the right way to construct the canonical measure on the Borel $\sigma$ -algebta of an oriented Riemannian manifold?

My work: For $0 < p < \infty$ , we have $$\tag{1}\int_X \log|f|\ d\mu \le \log\|f\|_p$$ using Jensen's inequality (and that $\log$ is a concave function). From Q5(a) of Rudin, we have $$\tag{2} 0 < r < s \le \infty \implies \|f\|_r \le \|f\|_s$$ From the graph of $x \mapsto \frac{a^x - 1}{x}$ , $\log a \le \frac{a^x - 1}{x}$ for $x > 0$ .

For $a >0$ , $x \mapsto \frac{a^x - 1}{x}$ is an  increasing function in $x$ . $\frac{|f|^{1/n} - 1}{1/n}$ is dominated by $\frac{|f|^{r} - 1}{r}$ for large enough $N$ , where the latter is integrable. On $B$ , $\frac{|f|^{1/n} - 1}{1/n} < 0$ , so $\frac{1 - |f|^{1/n}}{1/n} > 0$ . In fact, on $B$ , as $n\to\infty$ , $\frac{1 - |f|^{1/n}}{1/n}\nearrow -\log|f|$ pointwise. We can apply MCT on $B$ , and the DCT on $A$ , to get $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_X \frac{|f|^{1/n} - 1}{1/n}\ d\mu = \lim_{n\to\infty} \int_A \frac{|f|^{1/n} - 1}{1/n}\ d\mu - \lim_{n\to\infty}\int_B \frac{1 - |f|^{1/n}}{1/n}\ d\mu\\ = \int_A \log|f|\ d\mu + \int_B \log|f|\ d\mu= \int_X \log|f|\ d\mu$$ Due to inequality (2), and inequality (1), $\lim_{p\to 0} \log \|f\|_p$ exists.

Fix $m \geq N$ . Define $g(x) = \liminf_{n \to \infty} f_n(x)$ pointwise. We first show that $\liminf_{n\to \infty} |f_m(x) - f_n(x)| = |f_m(x) - g(x)|$ .

Suppose $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is a function. (a) For $k\in\mathbb{Z^+}$ , let $G_k=\{a\in\mathbb{R}:\text{there exists }\delta>0\text{ such that }|f(b)-f(c)|<\frac{1}{k}\text{ for all }b,c\in (a-\delta,a+\delta)\}$ . Prove that $G_k$ is an open set for each $k\in\mathbb{Z^+}$ ; (b) Prove that the set of points at which $f$ is continuous equals $\bigcap_{k=1}^{\infty}G_k$ (c) Conclude that the set of points at which $f$ is continuous is a Borel set. (a) Let $k\in\mathbb{Z^+}$ and $\alpha\in G_k$ : then there exists $\delta>0$ such that $|f(b)-f(c)|<\frac{1}{k}$ for all $b,c\in (\alpha-\delta,\alpha+\delta)$ . Now, let $\delta_{\alpha}:=\frac{\delta}{4}$ and take $\beta\in B_{\delta_{\alpha}}(\alpha):=(\alpha-\delta_{\alpha},\alpha+\delta_{\alpha})\subset (\alpha-\delta,\alpha+\delta)$ : if we let $\delta_{\beta}:=\frac{\delta_{\alpha}}{4}$ and take $b,c\in B_{\delta_{\beta}}(\beta):=(\beta-\delta_{\beta},\beta+\delta_\beta)\subset B_{\delta_{\alpha}}(\alpha)$ we have that $|f(b)-f(c)|<\frac{1}{k}$ thus $B_{\delta_\alpha}(\alpha)\subset G_k$ ie we have found an open ball centered in $\alpha$ contained in $G_k$ which is thus open, as desired. (b) Let $x_0\in\mathbb{R}$ be a point where $f$ is continuous and $k\in\mathbb{Z^+}$ : then by definition of continuous function for every $\varepsilon>0$ there exists $\delta_{\varepsilon}>0$ such that $|f(x)-f(x_0)|<\varepsilon$ for all $x\in (x_0-\delta_{\varepsilon},x_0+\delta_{\varepsilon})$ so in particular (since $\frac{1}{k}>0\ \forall k\in\mathbb{Z^+}$ ) for every $k\in\mathbb{Z^+}$ there exists $\delta_{k}>0$ such that $|f(x)-f(x_0)|<\frac{1}{2k}$ for all $x\in (x_0-\delta_{k},x_0+\delta_{k})$ and if we take $b,c\in(x_0-\delta_{k},x_0+\delta_k)$ we have that $|f(b)-f(a)|=|f(b)-f(x_0)+f(x_0)-f(a)|\leq |f(b)-f(x_0)|+|f(x_0)-f(a)|<\frac{1}{2k}+\frac{1}{2k}=\frac{1}{k}$ so $x_0\in G_k$ for every $k\in\mathbb{Z^+}$ thus $x\in\bigcap_{k=1}^{\infty}G_k$ . Now let $x_0\in\bigcap_{k=1}^{\infty} G_k$ and $\varepsilon>0$ : then $x\in G_k$ with $k>\frac{1}{2\varepsilon}$ so there exists $\delta_k$ such that $|f(b)-f(c)|<\frac{1}{2k}<\varepsilon$ for all $b,c\in (x_0-\delta_k,x_0+\delta_k)$ so it is also $|f(b)-f(x_0)|=|f(b)-f(c)+f(c)-f(x_0)|\leq |f(b)-f(c)|+|f(c)-f(x_0)|<\frac{1}{2k}+\frac{1}{2k}=\frac{1}{k}<\varepsilon$ for all $b\in (x_0-\delta_k,x_0+\delta_k)$ so $f$ is continuous at $x_0$ . Thus $\{x\in\mathbb{R}:f\text{ is continuous at }x\}=\bigcap_{k=1}^{\infty}G_k$ . (c) Since from point (b) we know that $\{x\in\mathbb{R}:f\text{ is continuous at }x\}=\bigcap_{k=1}^{\infty}G_k$ and from point (a) that the $G_k$ s are open sets in $\mathbb{R}$ hence Borel sets, since $\sigma$ -algebras like the set $\mathcal{B}$ of Borel sets are closed under intersections, we have that $\bigcap_{k=1}^{\infty} G_k$ is a Borel set hence $\{x\in\mathbb{R}:f\text{ is continuous at }x\}$ is a Borel set too.","I have proved the following statement(s) and I would like to know if my proof is correct and/or/how it could be improved, thank you.

74,Continuity of finite Borel measures on Euclidean subspaces,Continuity of finite Borel measures on Euclidean subspaces,,"Let $\mu$ be an absolutely continuous (w.r.t. the Lebeasgue measure $\lambda$ ) Borel measure on $(X, \mathcal{X})$ , where $X \subset \mathbb{R}^p$ , for some $p \geq 1$ . Then we know that $\mu$ is continuous from above/below: i.e. if $(A_n)_{n\geq 1} $ is a sequence of measurable sets then if $A_n \subset A_{n+1}$ (or $A_{n+1} \subset A_n$ ) we have $ \lim_{n \to \infty}\mu_n (A_n)=\mu(\cup_{n\geq 1} A_n) $ (or $\lim_{n \to \infty}\mu_n (A_n)=\mu(\cap_{n\geq 1} A_n)$ ). However, it is legitimate to wonder whether other forms of continuity hold true. In particular, for a sequence of vectors $x_n=(x_{n,1}, \ldots, x_{n,d})$ with positive components, one may denote $$ x_n \cdot B= \{x \cdot x_n: \, \in B\}, \quad B \in \mathcal{X}, $$ where $x_n \cdot x=(x_{n,1}x_1, \ldots, x_{n,p}x_p)$ denotes the componentwise product, and wonder whether $$ \lim_{n\to \infty}{x_{n,j}}=1, \forall j \in \{1, \ldots,p\} \implies \lim_{n \to \infty}\mu(x_n \cdot B)= \mu (B). $$ CASE 1: For bounded sets $B$ , it should be true that the condition on the left-hand side implies $\lambda(x_n \cdot B \, \triangle \, B)\to 0$ and hence $\mu(x_n \cdot B \, \triangle \, B)\to 0$ , since $\mu$ is assumed absolutely continuous (see Continuity for sets of asymptotically null Lebesgue measure ); herein $A \, \triangle \, B$ denotes the symmetric set difference. Is this correct? CASE 2: If $B$ is unbounded, we still have that $\mu$ is assumed finite, how can we proceed in this case? EDIT 1 In both cases, if we have that, denoting $B_n:=x_n \cdot B$ , $$ B=\limsup_{n\to \infty}B_n=\liminf_{n\to \infty}B_n=\lim_{n\to \infty} B_n, $$ then we can apply property (M12) on page 48 of Vestrup's book - The Theory of Measures and Integration , 2003, Wiley - and conclude that $\lim_{n\to \infty}\mu(B_n)=\mu(B)$ . EDIT 2 Resorting to the existence of $\lim_{n \to \infty}B_n$ is not necessary if $B$ is a closed set. Notice that $\mu(B_n \, \triangle \, B)\to 0 \implies \mu(B_n)\to \mu(B)$ . Also, notice that we can always construct a monotone nonincreasing positive sequence $r_n$ such that $1>r_n \downarrow 0$ and, ultimately, $$ \max_{1\leq j \leq d}|x_{n,j}-1|<r_n, $$ see e.g. Limits and existence of decay rates . Consequently, defining $$ \bar{B}_n^{(1)}=\{x \in X: \, \exists x' \in B\, \text{ s.t. } x'_j(1-r_n)\leq x_j \leq x_j'(1+r_n)\}, $$ $$ \bar{B}_n^{(2)}=\{x \in X: \, \exists x' \in B^c\, \text{ s.t. } x'_j(1-r_n)< x_j < x_j'(1+r_n)\}, $$ we have $\bar{B}_{n+1}^{(j)} \subset \bar{B}_n^{(j)}$ with $j=1,2$ . Ultimately $B_n \subset \bar{B}_n^{(1)}$ and $B_n^c= x_n \cdot B^c \subset \bar{B}_n^{(2)}$ , since we can define $T_n(x)=(x_{n,1}^{-1}, \ldots, x_{n,d}^{-1}) \cdot x$ , $\forall x \in X$ , and deduce $$ B_n^c=(T_n^{-1}(B))^c=T_n^{-1}(B^c)=x_n \cdot B^c, $$ see also Preimage of the complement . Moreover, $\lim_{n\to \infty}\bar{B}_n^{(1)}=B$ and $\lim_{n\to \infty}\bar{B}_n^{(2)}=B^c$ , thus $$ \lim_{n\to \infty}\bar{B}_n^{(1)}\cap B^c=\emptyset, \quad \lim_{n\to \infty}\bar{B}_n^{(2)}\cap B=\emptyset. $$ Ultimately, $$ \mu(B_n \cap B^c)\leq \mu(\bar{B}_n^{(1)}\cap B^c) \to 0, \quad  \mu(B_n^c \cap B)\leq \mu(\bar{B}_n^{(2)}\cap B) \to 0. $$ It now follows that $\mu(B_n \, \triangle \, B)\to 0$ .

Define an equivalence relation on $\mathcal{L}^p$ as $f \sim g \iff f = g, \ \mu \ \text{a.e.}$ Let $L^p$ be the set of equivalence classes. Then $(L^p, \|\cdot\|_p)$ becomes a normed space.
