Using this lemma, we first partion the $2n$ points into $A_1,A_{n-1}$ .

43,Showing that only $(n+1)^{n-1}$ of all the possible $n^n$ choices assure a full car park,Showing that only  of all the possible  choices assure a full car park,(n+1)^{n-1} n^n,"This exercise is taken from the site of Queen Mary University of London: A car park has $n$ spaces, numbered from $1$ to $n$ , arranged in a row. $n$ drivers each independently choose a favourite parking space in the park. As each driver enters the park, he drives to his favourite space. If it is empty, he parks there. Otherwise, he continues along the line and parks in the first free space. If all spaces between his favourite and $n$ are taken, he leaves in disgust. Show that, out of the $n^n$ choices of favourite spaces that the drivers can make, just $(n+1)^{n-1}$ lead to all drivers parking successfully. Now, my question is whether my (attempt of ) solution is wrong and what a different approach could be. Here's my idea: proving the claim by (a kind of) induction. It is easy to verify truthfulness for $n=1$ and $n=2$ , so having this base case, we shall prove that if the claim holds for all $1\le n\le k$ , then it does also for $n=k+1$ . Let us assume WLOG there is an already established order of appearance of the drivers, since a different order yields the same number of successful choices: it just suffices to swap the drivers. Let us call $d_m$ the space chosen by the $m$ -th driver. Now, consider the cases in which $d_1=1$ . By inductive hypothesis, the other drivers have $n^{n-2}$ successful choices. In fact, the same goes for all the other $n-1$ choices of the first driver, so that in total, as a ""first outcome"", we have $\color\red{n^{n-1}}$ successful choices. We somewhat can do the same reasoning with the second driver, but we must keep in mind that for each of his choices, we have already counted those in which the first driver occupies the other spaces.

Is there a mistake in my reasoning?","This exercise is taken from the site of Queen Mary University of London: A car park has spaces, numbered from to , arranged in a row. drivers each independently choose a favourite parking space in the park. As each driver enters the park, he drives to his favourite space. If it is empty, he parks there. Otherwise, he continues along the line and parks in the first free space. If all spaces between his favourite and are taken, he leaves in disgust. Show that, out of the choices of favourite spaces that the drivers can make, just lead to all drivers parking successfully. Now, my question is whether my (attempt of ) solution is wrong and what a different approach could be. Here's my idea: proving the claim by (a kind of) induction. It is easy to verify truthfulness for and , so having this base case, we shall prove that if the claim holds for all , then it does also for . Let us assume WLOG there is an already established order of appearance of the drivers, since a different order yields the same number of successful choices: it just suffices to swap the drivers. Let us call the space chosen by the -th driver. Now, consider the cases in which . By inductive hypothesis, the other drivers have successful choices. In fact, the same goes for all the other choices of the first driver, so that in total, as a ""first outcome"", we have successful choices. We somewhat can do the same reasoning with the second driver, but we must keep in mind that for each of his choices, we have already counted those in which the first driver occupies the other spaces. For example, we need to subtract the successful cases in which at the same time and : that is . This happens for all the spaces not chosen by the second driver, and so we actually need to subtract .

56,Mean and Median in a Classic River Crossing Problem,Mean and Median in a Classic River Crossing Problem,,"Consider the following classic problem: Four people on the west side of a river wish to use their single boat to get to the east side of a river. Each boat ride can hold at most two people, and the time it takes to get across will be the time preferred by the slower occupant. The time preferences are: $1, 2, 5$ and $10$ minutes. What is the minimal amount of time in which you can get all four people across the river, where an eastbound trip must have two occupants and a westbound trip must have one occupant? Answer: $17$ minutes. (Though many mistakenly believe it is $19$ minutes.) Question 1: If you look at all possible ways of ferrying these four people across the river, subject to the above constraints, what would the average (mean and median) times be? Question 2: What if you replace the time preferences with $x_1, x_2, x_3$ and $x_4$ minutes? Question 3: What if you have time preferences $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ minutes for $n$ people, respectively?

Each boat ride can hold at most two people, and the time it takes to get across will be the time preferred by the slower occupant. The time preferences are: $1, 2, 5$ and $10$ minutes. What is the minimal amount of time in which you can get all four people across the river, where an eastbound trip must have two occupants and a westbound trip must have one occupant? Answer: $17$ minutes. (Though many mistakenly believe it is $19$ minutes.) Question 1: If you look at all possible ways of ferrying these four people across the river, subject to the above constraints, what would the average (mean and median) times be? Question 2: What if you replace the time preferences with $x_1, x_2, x_3$ and $x_4$ minutes? Question 3: What if you have time preferences $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ minutes for $n$ people, respectively?

We call $(U,W)$ an $\varepsilon$ - regular pair in $G$ if for all $A\subseteq U$ and $B\subseteq W$ with $|A|\geq \varepsilon |U|$ and $|B|\geq \varepsilon  |W|$ , one has $$|d(A,B)-d(U,W)|\leq \varepsilon.$$ If $(U,W)$ is not $\varepsilon$ -regular, then we say that their irregularity is witnessed by some $A\subseteq U$ and $B\subseteq W$ satisfying $|A|\geq \varepsilon |U|$ , $|B|\geq \varepsilon |W|$ , and $|d(A,B)-d(U,W)|> \varepsilon.$ Definition 2.1.7 ( $\varepsilon$ -regular partition) Given a graph $G$ , a partition $\mathcal{P}=\{V_1,\dots,V_k\}$ of its vertex set is an $\varepsilon$ - regular partition if $$\sum_{\substack{(i,j)\in [k]^2\\\text{$(V_i,V_j)$ not  $\varepsilon$-regular}}}|V_i||V_j|\leq \varepsilon |V(G)|^2.$$ Now we can formulate Regularity Lemma: Theorem 2.1.9 (Szemeredi's graph regularity lemma) For every $\varepsilon>0$ , there exists a constant $M$ such that every graph has an $\varepsilon$ -regular partition into at most $M$ parts. In order to prove this fundamental result we need to introduce the following definition: Definition 2.1.10 (Energy) Let $G$ be an $n$ -vertex graph. Let $U,W\subseteq V(G)$ . Define $$q(U,W):=\frac{|U||W|}{n^2}d(U,W)^2,$$ where $d(U,W)$ is an edge density between $U$ and $W$ . For partitions $\mathcal{P}_{U}=\{U_1,\dots,U_k\}$ of $U$ and $\mathcal{P_W}=\{W_1,\dots,W_l\}$ of $W$ , define $$q(\mathcal{P}_U,\mathcal{P}_W):=\sum  \limits_{i=1}^{k}\sum_{j=1}^{l}q(U_i,W_j).$$ Finally, for a partition $\mathcal{P}=\{V_1,\dots,V_k\}$ of $V(G)$ , define its energy to be $$q(\mathcal{P}):=q(\mathcal{P},\mathcal{P})=\sum  \limits_{i,j=1}^{k}q(V_i,V_j)=\sum  \limits_{i,j=1}^{k}\frac{|V_i||V_j|}{n^2}d(V_i,V_j)^2.$$ Since the edge density is always between $0$ and $1$ , we have $0\leq q(\mathcal{P})\leq 1$ for all partitions $\mathcal{P}$ . The following lemma plays an important role in the proof of Graph Regularity Lemma. Lemma 2.1.14 (Energy boost for an irregular partition) If a partition $\mathcal{P}=\{V_1,\dots,V_k\}$ of $V(G)$ is not $\varepsilon$ -regular, then there exists a refinement $\mathcal{Q}$ of $\mathcal{P}$ where every $V_i$ is partitioned into at most $2^{k+1}$ parts, and such that $$q(\mathcal{Q})>q(\mathcal{P})+\varepsilon^5.$$ Proof of the graph regularity lemma (Theorem 2.1.9). Start with a trivial partition of the vertex set of the graph. Repeatedly apply Lemma 2.1.14 whenever the current partition is not $\varepsilon$ -regular. By Lemma 2.1.14, the energy of the partition increases by more than $\varepsilon^5$ at each iteration. Since the energy of the partition is $\leq 1$ , we must stop after $<\varepsilon^{-5}$ iterations, terminating in an $\varepsilon$ -regular partition. If a partition has $k$ parts, then Lemma 2.1.14 produces a refinement with $\leq k2^{k+1}$ parts. We start with a trivial partition with one part, and then refine $<\varepsilon^{-5}$ times. Observe the crude bound $k2^{k+1}\leq2^{2^k}$ . So the total number of parts at the end is $\leq \text{tower}(\lceil 2\varepsilon^{-5}\rceil)$ (In the book author writes ceiling function, but I believe one can take floor function as well, i.e. I mean that the total number of parts at the end is $\leq \text{tower}(\lfloor 2\varepsilon^{-5}\rfloor)$ ), where $$\text{tower}(k):=2^{2^{.^{.^{.^{2}}}}} \Bigg\} \text{height $k$}$$ Question: The regularity lemma is quite flexible. For example, we can start with an arbitrary partition of $V(G)$ instead of the trivial partition in the proof, in order to obtain a partition that is a refinement of a given partition. The exact same proof with this modification yields the following. Theorem 2.1.19 (Regularity starting with an arbitrary intiial partition) For every $\varepsilon>0$ , there exists a constant $M$ such that for every graph $G$ and a partition $\mathcal{P}_0$ of $V(G)$ , there exists an $\varepsilon$ -regular partition $\mathcal{P}$ of $V(G)$ that is a refinement of $\mathcal{P}_0$ , and such that each part of $\mathcal{P}_0$ is refined into at most $M$ parts. I don't think that it follows easily and directly as we did in original formulation of regularity lemma. This is what I've done so far. Let $\varepsilon>0$ be given and take any graph $G$ and fix some partition $\mathcal{P}_0=\{V_1,\dots,V_k\}$ of $V(G)$ . If $\mathcal{P}_0$ is $\varepsilon$ -regular, then we are done. Otherwise, we apply Lemma 2.1.14  and obtain a partition $\mathcal{P}_1$ of $V(G)$ which refines $\mathcal{P}_0$ such that $|\mathcal{P}_1|\leq k2^{k+1}$ and $q(\mathcal{P}_1)>q(\mathcal{P}_0)+\varepsilon^5$ . By the same reasoning at the $N$ th step we have an $\varepsilon$ -partition $\mathcal{P}_N$ , where $N<\varepsilon^{-5}$ and $$|\mathcal{P}_N|\leq 2^{2^{\dots^{2^k}}} \Bigg \} \text{height $(2N+1)$}.$$ But we see that the size of $\mathcal{P}_N$ depends depends also on $k=|\mathcal{P}_0|$ . We know that $2N+1\leq \lfloor 2\varepsilon^{-5}\rfloor+1$ . But I am wondering is it possible to give an upper bound for $k$ in terms of $\varepsilon$ ? Can anyone help me please? P.S. Unfortunately, my edit was wrong so I've decided to give bounty on this question. I worked hard on this question for 3-4 days but I don't know the answer. EDIT: I think that I understood the claim. It was much simpler than I thought before. Suppose we fix some partition $\mathcal{P}_0$ of $V(G)$ . We already know that if we start from trivial partition, then we end up in $\varepsilon$ -regular partition (say $\mathcal{P}'$ ) in fewer than $\text{tower}(\lfloor 2\varepsilon^{-5} \rfloor)$ steps. However, if we intersect $\mathcal{P}_0$ with partitions (by intersection I mean a common refinement of two partitions) at each step and since energy does not decrease under refinement, then we still obtain an $\varepsilon$ -regular partition which refines $\mathcal{P_0}$ and the number of parts in this partition is $\leq |\mathcal{P}_0|\text{tower}(\lfloor 2\varepsilon^{-5} \rfloor)$ .

70,"Given n squares, in how many ways can they be contiguously arranged into a single shape?","Given n squares, in how many ways can they be contiguously arranged into a single shape?",,"Context: At school today, a friend of mine ripped up a piece of paper he had written on. I was considering the number of possible ways I could rearrange these individual pieces to try to reconstruct the whole, and the runtime complexity of such a de-rearrangement. However, that’s a question for the theoretical CS StackExchange, not here. What I’m interested in is a more simplified problem: If some polygon in a Euclidean space which only contains right-angles is cut into equally-sized individual squares, into how many possible configurations can these squares be rearranged, allowing only rotation and translation, and no reflections (since a reflection of an actual piece of paper would imply flipping over whatever text is written on it)? I thought of using graph theory to analyze this–that is, each square node can be in 4 possible states, because it can be rotated into 4 separate states ( $4^{n}$ possible rotational states overall) and each node can have at most 4 edges extending from it (since equally-sized squares can touch at most 4 others). However, note that if you have square-nodes A, B, and C, and they are connected in a line from left to right like ABC, that is a different configuration from CBA even though each individual letter has an edge connecting it to the same other nodes, which doesn’t align with the way that graph theory equates any two such graphs regardless of their physical representation. ABC is the same thing, however, to CBA with each node rotated twice if I’m not mistaken, if you wish to think of all rotations of the overall structure as the same thing. I’m thinking that maybe each edge can also be labeled with a number 1-4 that represents the direction in which the contact between the two squares occurs, but at this point I’m stuck because I have no formal training in graph theory. This certainly seems like a problem within combinatorics, in which I have very minor experience (I learned a little bit for Academic Decathlon last year). I think the problem will be more easily represented by looking at a few cases. Case 1: 1 square Result: Either 1 or 4 ways, depending on whether you wish to consider rotations of the entire structure to be the same thing. From now on, for simplicity’s sake, I will say that every rotation of the entire structure is a separate structure. Case 2: 2 squares Result: Let’s call these squares A and B. A can connect to B’s left, right, top, or bottom side. A being on B’s left is the same as B being on A’s right. There are thus 4 connection states, and for each square, there are 4 rotation states. That’s $4^2 = 16$ rotation states overall, multiplied by the 4 connection states, giving $4^3 = 64$ states overall. Case 3: 3 squares Result: Let’s call these squares A, B, and C. I think that each outcome might be able to be represented by a tree, where at each point I choose whether to include or exclude a square from the next side. Each time I make a choice to include another square, I have one fewer squares to choose from. I must, however, choose every square, because I’m not making a discontinuous or incomplete shape here. Note that if two squares touch the same other square, they do not touch each other, so contact is never transitive. However, if the difference between the sides chosen on a given square (A) for two other squares (B and C) has an absolute value of 1, then a fourth square (D) is able to touch both B and C. This makes a tree very confusing to deal with. So, at square A, I can choose either B or C to go on either side 1, 2, 3, or 4. Once I place 1 of those 2 squares, I have only 1 square left to choose from that can go on 1 of the 3 remaining sides of the other two squares, giving me 6 choices. If I choose B the first time around, then that gives me 4 possible position-configurations, and then after placing C I can actualize the next 6 possible configurations one step down the line. This gives $4*6 = 24$ possible position configurations when choosing B first. The same follows with C, meaning that there are actually $4*6*2 = 48$ possible position-configurations. With the 4 possible rotations for each square, I have $4^3 = 64$ rotation-states for the figure, giving $64*48 = 3,072$ possible configuration states for the three squares in the image. If, hypothetically (though not applicable in my usage case), we were allowed to reflect each of these squares as well, you would have to consider the 4 axes of symmetry on each of the squares, giving another $4^3 = 64$ reflection states for the shape, which when multiplied by our previous $3,072$ states gives $196,608$ possible states for the image. I’m not sure which sets of rotations or reflections would be equivalent (I’d have to learn some group theory to predict that), but that’s a lot for 3 squares. Case 4: 4 squares Results: This one is a bit harder. Since the first three squares can be placed in an L-shape, the fourth square can be placed to fill in the corner, which can be reached two separate ways by placing the square on one side of two separate squares respectively. I don’t know how to calculate this one. Overall: I think it would be nice if anyone could tell me of a more general view of this problem and its solution (for example, using any polygon as the decomposed shape which can be arranged into a gapless tiling like a triangle, square, or hexagon, and considering the options based on its number of sides and its number of symmetries). Edit: I just realized that in the case of the three squares, I can also perform a similar process of choice starting with each of the three squares individually rather than the others. This means that I have a separate set of $3,072$ configurations starting with each square, giving me $3*3072 = 9,216$ arrangements with rotation, and $9,216*64 = 589,824$ reflection-allowing states.","Context: At school today, a friend of mine ripped up a piece of paper he had written on.

73,Alternative proofs that the multiplicative group $(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^*$ is cyclic,Alternative proofs that the multiplicative group  is cyclic,(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^*,"Let $p$ be prime. Every proof of the fact that $(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^*$ is cyclic uses at some point the fact that $x^a = 1 \pmod{p}$ has at most $a$ solutions. Gauss' original two proofs (showing the existence of a primitive root) use this fact and this source actually gives seven proofs, of which only the last one does not use this fact, but that one instead uses heavier machinery with cyclotomic polynomials anyway. It annoys me that this fact is so necessary and I was wondering if there are any proofs without it. The closest to an alternative proof, that I know of, works when the prime decomposition of $p-1$ contains primes only once, i.e. $p-1 = q_1 q_2\cdots q_n$ for distinct primes $q_i$ . Primes below $100$ of this form are $3$ , $7$ , $11$ , $23$ , $31$ , $43$ , $47$ , $59$ , $67$ , $71$ , $79$ , and $83$ . This alternative proof is due to McKay's proof of Cauchy's Theorem. It suffices to show for each prime $q_i$ that there exists an $a_i$ with order $q_i$ , since then the product $a_1 a_2 \cdots a_n$ has order $q_1 q_2 \cdots q_n = p-1$ and so $(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^*$ is cyclic. So let's fix $q = q_i$ for some $q_i$ . Instead of finding an $a \neq 1$ with $a^q \equiv_p 1$ , let's solve the simpler problem of finding $(a_1, \ldots ,a_q)$ with $a_1 a_2 \cdots a_q \equiv_p 1$ . There are $(p-1)^{q-1}$ such tuples: Fix the first $q-1$ elements and solve for $a_q$ . Furthermore, if $(a_1, a_2, \ldots ,a_q)$ is a solution, then the cyclic permutation $(a_q, a_1, \ldots,a_{q-1})$ is one. That means solutions that are permutations of each other come in sets of size $q$ , except for the solutions that are their own permutation, i.e. $a_1 = \cdots = a_q$ . Let $N$ be the set of such solutions. We have that $|N| = (p-1)^{q-1} - \textit{sets of size }q$ . As $p-1$ and $q$ are obviously multiples of $q$ , the right side is a multiple of $q$ and therefore $|N|$ is too. But since $N$ contains the solution $(1, \ldots, 1)$ , $|N| \geq q$ and therefore there exists a non-trivial solution $(a, \ldots, a)$ with $a^q = 1$ . $\tag*{$\Box$}$ I like this alternative proof, because it has a more combinatorial flavour to it and is less algebraic. Again, I'd be thankful for any proof that does not use the fact that $x^a \equiv 1 \pmod p$ has at most $a$ solutions directly.

For example, for the first ten we have $1 \rightarrow \{1,3,7,9\}$. In fact, $10+1$, $10+3$, $10+7$ and $10+9$ are all primes.

(In different ways when one looks at the windmill from the front and the wings rotate.) Use Pólya's theorem and the fact that the group $C_n$ that consists of rotations of a regular $n$-polygon has the cycle index $$\frac 1n\sum_{d\,|\, n} \varphi(d)t_d^{\frac nd},$$ where $\varphi(d)=\left |\{j\,:\, 0\leq j\leq d-1,\; \textrm{gcd}(j,d)=1\}\right |$, but observe that in this case the number of orbits is double that of a regular $n$-polygon because each wing is built from two parts. Here $\sum_{ d\,|\,n}$ means that we take the sum over all integers $d$ such that $1\leq d\leq n$ and $n$ is divisible by $d$ and the term $t_d^{\frac nd}$ is due to the fact that in the rotation group there is an element so that the cyclic group generated by it has $\frac nd$ orbits with length $d$.

If on the wings of the windmill $4$ parts are colored black, $3$ parts are colored red, and $3$ parts are colored orange, in how many ways can one then color the windmill? (In different ways when one looks at the windmill from the front and the wings rotate.) Use Pólya's theorem and the fact that the group $C_n$ that consists of rotations of a regular $n$-polygon has the cycle index $$\frac 1n\sum_{d\,|\, n} \varphi(d)t_d^{\frac nd},$$ where $\varphi(d)=\left |\{j\,:\, 0\leq j\leq d-1,\; \textrm{gcd}(j,d)=1\}\right |$, but observe that in this case the number of orbits is double that of a regular $n$-polygon because each wing is built from two parts. Here $\sum_{ d\,|\,n}$ means that we take the sum over all integers $d$ such that $1\leq d\leq n$ and $n$ is divisible by $d$ and the term $t_d^{\frac nd}$ is due to the fact that in the rotation group there is an element so that the cyclic group generated by it has $\frac nd$ orbits with length $d$.

94,Partitioning $n$ naturals summing $2N$ into two sets summing $N$,Partitioning  naturals summing  into two sets summing,n 2N N,"I'm trying to solve this problem: Let $a_1, \ldots , a_n$ be natural numbers such that $a_k \le k$ for every $k = 1,\ldots,n$, and $\sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k=2N$. Show that there exists a partition of this $n$ numbers in two sets, such that for each set, the sum of its elements is $N$. I think I found an algorithm that works, but I don't know how to formally prove that it works. It goes as follows: We have $a_1, \ldots , a_n$. Rearrange the elements in ascending order. This preserves the property that $a_k \le k$ for every $k = 1,\ldots,n$. Then start by picking the biggest element $a_n$. Add to it $a_{n-1}$, which is $\le a_{n}$. If the sum exceeds N, go back on your steps and substract $a_{n-1}$, then try the same with $a_{n-2}$. If, on the contrary, the sum didn't exceed N, also go on to $a_{n-2}$, but this time without subtracting $a_{n-1}$. Keep doing this until you reach $a_1$, meaning that you tried to add every element to the sum, with the condition that the inclusion of that element doesn't make the sum bigger than $N$. In the end, the elements you picked sum $N$, and the ones left out also sum $N$. Could someone help me formalize this?

In how many ways can the balls be distributed among the boxes so that each box contains $m$ balls? The way I read this, there are a total of $mn$ balls. If we order the boxes (which we can without changing the results because they're different shapes) then we can find the number of possibilities for the first $m$ balls (i.e. the first box). Since we could have any color of ball in any amount in the first box, we can use stars and bars to find the number of possibilities. We imagine the color possibilities as the spaces between ""bars,"" so we have $n-1$ bars, and the (uncolored) balls as ""stars,"" so we have $m$ stars. This gives the number of possibilities for just the first box as $$\binom{m+n-1}{n-1}$$ However, the number for the second box varies greatly depending on which configuration the first box is in, so I don't think this method will continue to work.
