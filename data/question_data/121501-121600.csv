0,How many points distant from each other can fall in a ball?,How many points distant from each other can fall in a ball?,,"Let's say we have a closed ball  $B(x,r)\subset\mathcal{R}^n$ centered at $x$ with radius $r$. The question I want to ask is: how many distinct points in $\mathcal{R}^n$, in which the distance between any two points is larger than or equal to $r$, can fall in $B(x,r)$? When $n=2$, the question is easy to visualise. But to imagine the case generally when $n$ is large is not so easy. I think the points must be located on the boundary of $B(x,r)$ to maximise the number. Therefore it is possible to derive an upper bound by estimating the area each point would occupy on the boundary of $B(x,r)$. But the computation gets complicated because the area occupied by several points depends on the location of these points.

1,How to start with $\pi$ defined as the area of the unit circle.,How to start with  defined as the area of the unit circle.,\pi,"In IV-1, Example 3 of Advanced Calculus of Several Variables, by C. E. Edwards Jr. the reader is told ""Since $\pi$ is by definition the area of the unit circle,..."". The example provides a proof that $A=\pi r^2$, so that result cannot be used to justify the (unconventional) definition. Every definition of $\pi$ I have seen in mathematical literature amounts to: Given a circle of diameter $D$ and circumference $C$, the real number $\pi$ is defined as $\pi=\frac{C}{D}$. I could propose a number of alternative ways of defining $\pi$. For example, Wallis's product: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallis_product .  From there one must demonstrate that $\pi$ so defined satisfies $\pi=\frac{C}{D}$. Similarly, the definition promulgated by Edwards must result in $\pi=\frac{C}{D}$.  I'm sure I could provide persuasive arguments toward this end.  What I would like to know is whether there is an established convention for demonstrating that Edwards's definition of $\pi$ is equivalent to the traditional form I stated above. In particular, I am interested to know how this has been done without the use of trigonometry nor calculus. Edit to add: This is my heuristic argument showing $2\pi r=C$. Assuming $A=\pi r^2$. For a small change in radius $\Delta r$ there will be a corresponding change in circumference $\Delta C$. The change in area will be the area of an annulus $\Delta A=\pi(r-\Delta r)^{2}-\pi r^{2}=\pi(2r\Delta r+\Delta r^{2})=(C+\varepsilon)\Delta r$. Where $0<\varepsilon<\Delta C$. The last expression follows from the observation that $(C+\Delta C)\Delta r>\Delta A>C\Delta r$. That is, $\Delta A$ falls somewhere between the area of a rectangle $C\times\Delta r$ and the area of a rectangle $(C+\Delta C)\times\Delta r$. The last two expressions in the above equivalence result in $2\pi r+\pi\Delta r=C+\varepsilon$. Clearly $\varepsilon\to0$ as $\Delta r\to0$. So what remains is $2\pi r=C$.","In IV-1, Example 3 of Advanced Calculus of Several Variables, by C. E.

I was considering looking at an extreme scenario, with an arbitrarily high number of rectangles which are very long. If I can prove this scenario fails, then any other one must too, since one large piece is just multiple smaller pieces and increasing the length of a piece cannot decrease coverage. I was also considering looking at total area each rectangle covers minus the overlapped area with another rectangle. I was thinking about working with an expression for the total covered area, and somehow showing that only a parallel arrangement can make the total equal to the circle's area.

14,Triangling a triangle,Triangling a triangle,,"It is widely known that we can square a square , which is defined as follows: ""Squaring a square"" is tiling a square with integer side lengths with smaller squares with integer side lengths. In reality it is very simple; we can for example tile a $2\times2$ square with four unit squares. Thus, people've thought of the restriction that all tiles must have different sizes, which they've named perfect . This turns out to be possible, with the smallest perfectly squared square being a $112\times112$ square: My question is simple: can we do the same with equilateral triangles? Meaning, can we tile an equilateral triangle with integer side lengths with smaller equilateral triangles with integer (but all different) side lengths? If so, what would be the smallest perfectly triangled triangle? EDIT: So I've been doing some thinking and I think I'm getting closer. Let's have a look at the smallest triangle tile (we'll call it $\tau$). We'll split cases. Case 1: $\tau$ is in a vertex. If the little triangle is a tile in one of the three vertices of the parent triangle, then it has one edge left; only triangles smaller than or as small as $\tau$ can fill that edge, but $\tau$ was the smallest triangle. This is impossible. Case 2: $\tau$ is on the border. If $\tau$ is on the border of the parent triangle, but not in the corner, then either side of $\tau$ is touching that of a bigger triangle, which makes those two neighboring tiles overlap. This is also impossible. Assume now $\tau$ is not on the border of the parent triangle. Case 3: An edge of $\tau$ is touching a vertex. If an edge is touching a vertex, then since the neighboring tiles are bigger, we have the following (the orange tile being $\tau$, ignore that the blue triangle is the same size, it's beside the point): Which makes this case equivalent to case 2. And then the last case is when none of the above hold, but I'm quite stuck on that.","It is widely known that we can square a square , which is defined as follows: ""Squaring a square"" is tiling a square with integer side lengths with smaller squares with integer side lengths. In reality it is very simple; we can for example tile a $2\times2$ square with four unit squares. Thus, people've thought of the restriction that all tiles must have different sizes, which they've named perfect . This turns out to be possible, with the smallest perfectly squared square being a $112\times112$ square: My question is simple: can we do the same with equilateral triangles? Meaning, can we tile an equilateral triangle with integer side lengths with smaller equilateral triangles with integer (but all different) side lengths? If so, what would be the smallest perfectly triangled triangle? EDIT: So I've been doing some thinking and I think I'm getting closer. Let's have a look at the smallest triangle tile (we'll call it $\tau$). We'll split cases. Case 1: $\tau$ is in a vertex. If the little triangle is a tile in one of the three vertices of the parent triangle, then it has one edge left; only triangles smaller than or as small as $\tau$ can fill that edge, but $\tau$ was the smallest triangle. This is impossible. Case 2: $\tau$ is on the border. If $\tau$ is on the border of the parent triangle, but not in the corner, then either side of $\tau$ is touching that of a bigger triangle, which makes those two neighboring tiles overlap.

16,An inverse problem for cross sections,An inverse problem for cross sections,,"I apologize beforehand for the vague title and the length of the description I am using to setup my question; I can't seem to be more concise without sacrificing clarity. Call a region in the plane ""nice"" if its intersection with any line consists of a finite number of closed intervals. (Is there an existing term for such a region?). The ""size"" of any such intersection is, naturally, the sum of the lengths of these intervals. Consider a nice region R.

Here are a couple of questions with (almost) obvious answers: Question 1: Given a nonnegative function h, does there exist a nice region whose cross section (along some line) is h? Answer 1: Yes, always. (easy) Question 2: Given two nonnegative functions g, h and two lines k, l, does there exist a nice region R whose cross sections along k, l are g, h (respectively)?

45,Circle Packing in an Elastic Container,Circle Packing in an Elastic Container,,"A (somewhat) common problem in geometry and optimization deals with how to most efficiently pack $n$ rigid disks inside a given container of some fixed size and shape (e.g. a circular container, a rectangular container, etc).

It seems to me that, if we allow a collection of circles to be enclosed in an elastic container, the most efficient packing should be the packing that minimized the stretching of the elastic - i.e. its perimeter. The question, then, can be stated: Given a collection of $n$ unit disks, find a placement of the disks and a closed piecewise smooth curve such that None of the disks overlap Every disk is enclosed by the curve The length of the curve is minimized Obviously, this is a very difficult problem, so I don't expect any solutions below.

For each $i \ge 3$, define $P_i$ to be the centre of the circumcircle of $\triangle P_{i−1}P_{i−2}P_{i−3}$. Prove that the points $P_1, P_5, P_9, P_13, \ldots$ are collinear. Let $x$ be the distance from $P_1$ to $P_{1001}$, and let $y$ be the distance from $P_{1001}$ to $P_{2001}$. Determine all values of $t$ for which $\sqrt[500]{\frac{x}{y}}$ is an integer. This question is from the 2001 Canada National Olympiad. Is there a cleaner way of solving the problem, using e.g. vectors, complex numbers, or some theorem, so that one does not need to take cues from such an accurate diagram? The diagram below (from GeoGebra) shows an example of a possible (converging) sequence of points. (It is possible for the points to diverge if $t$ is nearly zero or nearly diametral.) Note that every triangle other than possibly the initial one is isosceles, i.e. $$P_{i-2}P_{i}=P_{i-1}P_{i},\qquad i\ge 3 \tag{1}$$ Since $P_i$ (for $i\ge3$) is equidistant from all of $P_{i−1},P_{i−2},P_{i−3}$, then $P_i$ must be on the perpendicular bisector of $P_{i−1}P_{i−2}$ and $P_{i−2}P_{i−3}$. So, if $\angle{P_{i-2}P_{i-1}P_{i}}=\alpha,\angle{P_{i-1}P_{i}P_{i+1}}=\beta$ (as labeled for the $i=3$ example), then  $$\beta=\frac{\pi}{2}-\alpha \tag{2}$$ This relationship can be applied inductively to all larger $i$ to show that: $$\triangle{P_{i-2}P_{i-1}P_{i}} \sim \triangle{P_{i}P_{i+1}P_{i+2}},\qquad i\ge 3 \tag{3}$$ and that  $$\triangle{P_{i-2}P_{i-1}P_{i}} \perp \triangle{P_{i}P_{i+1}P_{i+2}},\qquad i\ge 3 \tag{4}$$ Also because triangles turn through $90^\circ$ every two point, then side $P_{i-2}P_{i-1}$ is anti-parallel to side $P_{i+2}P_{i+3}$, i.e. $$P_{i-2}P_{i-1} \parallel P_{i+3}P_{i+2},\qquad \tag{5}$$ As before, let $\angle{P_{i-2}P_{i-1}P_{i}}=\alpha,\angle{P_{i-1}P_{i}P_{i+1}}=\beta$, with $i\ge3$ odd, and let distance $P_{i-2}P_{i-1}=x$. Then  $$\begin{align} P_{i-1}P_{i}&=\frac{1}{2}x\sec\alpha \\[1em] P_{i}P_{i+1}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}x\sec\alpha\right)\sec{\beta}&=\frac{1}{4}x\,\sec\alpha\,\mathrm{cosec}\,\alpha \\ \end{align}$$ so $$\frac{P_{i-2}P_{i-1}}{P_{i}P_{i+1}}=4\sin\alpha\cos\alpha=2\sin{2\alpha}=2\sin{2\beta}=4\sin\beta\cos\beta$$ From the problem definition, assuming WLOG that $\beta<\frac{\pi}{2}$, we have $\sin\beta=\frac{t}{2}$ and $\cos\beta=\frac{\sqrt{4-t^2}}{2}$ so that $$\frac{P_{i-2}P_{i-1}}{P_{i}P_{i+1}}=t\sqrt{4-t^2},\qquad i\ge3 \tag{6}$$ Applying (6) repeatedly: $$\frac{P_{i}P_{i+1}}{P_{i+2k}P_{i+2k+1}}=\left(t\sqrt{4-t^2}\right)^k,\qquad i\ge1,k\ge0 \tag{7}$$ Part 1 I'm not quite sure how to prove this rigorously. It's obvious that the next point in the sequence depends only on the previous three and nothing beyond this. So if triangles turn through $90^\circ$ every two points (and hence $180^\circ$ every four points) and are similar, then any four consecutive segments in the path are a translated, mirrored and scaled image of the next four segments in the path. Then $P_1,P_5,P_9,\ldots$ must be collinear. And $P_2,P_6,P_{10},\ldots$, etc. Should I formalise this e.g. by using vectors? Part 2 The path is a regular spiral (claimed), so by similarity arguments $$\frac{x}{y}=\frac{P_{1}P_{2}}{P_{1001}P_{1002}}=\left(t\sqrt{4-t^2}\right)^{500}$$ Therefore, for the ratio as a function of $t$: $$f(t)=\sqrt[500]{\frac{x}{y}}=t\sqrt{4-t^2}$$ Since $f(t)$ has a maximum when $t=\sqrt2$ and $f(\sqrt2)=\sqrt2\sqrt{4-2}=2$, we immediately have one integer value at: $$\boxed{t=\sqrt2}$$ So it remains to find $t$ at which $f(t)=1$.  $$\begin{align} t\sqrt{4-t^2}=1 \implies t^2(4-t^2)=1 &\implies t^4-4t^2+1=0 \implies t^2=2\pm\sqrt3 \end{align}$$ From $t^2=2+\sqrt3$ we get $\boxed{t=\dfrac{1+\sqrt3}{\sqrt2}}$ From $t^2=2-\sqrt3$ we get $\boxed{t=\dfrac{-1+\sqrt3}{\sqrt2}}$ Remark: If $\frac{1+\sqrt3}{\sqrt2}<t<2$ or $t<\frac{-1+\sqrt3}{\sqrt2}$, the sequence of points diverges ($f(t)<1$).","Let $P_0, P_1, P_2$ be three points on the circumference of a circle with radius $1$, where $P_1P_2 = t < 2$. For each $i \ge 3$, define $P_i$ to be the centre of the circumcircle of $\triangle P_{i−1}P_{i−2}P_{i−3}$. Prove that the points $P_1, P_5, P_9, P_13, \ldots$ are collinear. Let $x$ be the distance from $P_1$ to $P_{1001}$, and let $y$ be the distance from $P_{1001}$ to $P_{2001}$. Determine all values of $t$ for which $\sqrt[500]{\frac{x}{y}}$ is an integer. This question is from the 2001 Canada National Olympiad. Is there a cleaner way of solving the problem, using e.g. vectors, complex numbers, or some theorem, so that one does not need to take cues from such an accurate diagram? The diagram below (from GeoGebra) shows an example of a possible (converging) sequence of points. (It is possible for the points to diverge if $t$ is nearly zero or nearly diametral.) Note that every triangle other than possibly the initial one is isosceles, i.e. $$P_{i-2}P_{i}=P_{i-1}P_{i},\qquad i\ge 3 \tag{1}$$ Since $P_i$ (for $i\ge3$) is equidistant from all of $P_{i−1},P_{i−2},P_{i−3}$, then $P_i$ must be on the perpendicular bisector of $P_{i−1}P_{i−2}$ and $P_{i−2}P_{i−3}$. So, if $\angle{P_{i-2}P_{i-1}P_{i}}=\alpha,\angle{P_{i-1}P_{i}P_{i+1}}=\beta$ (as labeled for the $i=3$ example), then  $$\beta=\frac{\pi}{2}-\alpha \tag{2}$$ This relationship can be applied inductively to all larger $i$ to show that: $$\triangle{P_{i-2}P_{i-1}P_{i}} \sim \triangle{P_{i}P_{i+1}P_{i+2}},\qquad i\ge 3 \tag{3}$$ and that  $$\triangle{P_{i-2}P_{i-1}P_{i}} \perp \triangle{P_{i}P_{i+1}P_{i+2}},\qquad i\ge 3 \tag{4}$$ Also because triangles turn through $90^\circ$ every two point, then side $P_{i-2}P_{i-1}$ is anti-parallel to side $P_{i+2}P_{i+3}$, i.e. $$P_{i-2}P_{i-1} \parallel P_{i+3}P_{i+2},\qquad \tag{5}$$ As before, let $\angle{P_{i-2}P_{i-1}P_{i}}=\alpha,\angle{P_{i-1}P_{i}P_{i+1}}=\beta$, with $i\ge3$ odd, and let distance $P_{i-2}P_{i-1}=x$. Then  $$\begin{align} P_{i-1}P_{i}&=\frac{1}{2}x\sec\alpha \\[1em] P_{i}P_{i+1}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}x\sec\alpha\right)\sec{\beta}&=\frac{1}{4}x\,\sec\alpha\,\mathrm{cosec}\,\alpha \\ \end{align}$$ so $$\frac{P_{i-2}P_{i-1}}{P_{i}P_{i+1}}=4\sin\alpha\cos\alpha=2\sin{2\alpha}=2\sin{2\beta}=4\sin\beta\cos\beta$$ From the problem definition, assuming WLOG that $\beta<\frac{\pi}{2}$, we have $\sin\beta=\frac{t}{2}$ and $\cos\beta=\frac{\sqrt{4-t^2}}{2}$ so that $$\frac{P_{i-2}P_{i-1}}{P_{i}P_{i+1}}=t\sqrt{4-t^2},\qquad i\ge3 \tag{6}$$ Applying (6) repeatedly: $$\frac{P_{i}P_{i+1}}{P_{i+2k}P_{i+2k+1}}=\left(t\sqrt{4-t^2}\right)^k,\qquad i\ge1,k\ge0 \tag{7}$$ Part 1 I'm not quite sure how to prove this rigorously. It's obvious that the next point in the sequence depends only on the previous three and nothing beyond this. So if triangles turn through $90^\circ$ every two points (and hence $180^\circ$ every four points) and are similar, then any four consecutive segments in the path are a translated, mirrored and scaled image of the next four segments in the path. Then $P_1,P_5,P_9,\ldots$ must be collinear. And $P_2,P_6,P_{10},\ldots$, etc. Should I formalise this e.g. by using vectors?

72,Parameterizing equilateral polygons,Parameterizing equilateral polygons,,"I'm not exactly sure how to describe what I want, so if I butcher terms, please forgive me :) I want to ""parameterize"" the space of simple ir regular equilateral polygons with n sides, or at least a large-ish subset of them.  That is, the user provides the number of edges in the polygon ($n$) and a set of parameters $[x_1, x_2, ... x_m]$ that satisfy some equalities and  inequalities (so $Ax \ge b, Cx = d$ for $A \in \mathbf{R}^{p \times m}, b \in \mathbf{R}^p, C \in \mathbf{R}^{q \times m}, d \in \mathbf{R}^q$).  For each valid configuration vector $x$ I want to be able to construct a unique equilateral $n$-gon.  I want the space of polygons I can construct to be as rich as possible. As an example, if $n$ is 3, then the only valid equilateral 3-gon is the equilateral triangle and the configuration space is basically empty so the whole thing is moot.  If $n$ is 4, then valid polygons are convex and shaped like kites, and there's basically only a single degree of freedom and I could use the width, say, as my configuration vector. For larger values of $n$, though, the obvious possibilities for $x$ start to break down.  For instance if you take the sum of the internal angles of the polygon and force them to add to $\pi (n - 2)$ you're not guaranteed that the ends meet up and form a complete circuit.  If you try to require that the ends meet up I don't see a way to express that as a linear equality.  (Notice that constructing the polygon doesn't have to be a linear operation.  Just that the constraints on the configuration vector are linear). Or if you assume the polygon is a star-shaped polygon, with the values of $x$ being the distances from some ""center"" point in the kernel to the vertices of the polyogn, I don't see a way to enforce the equilateral-ness of the polygon without adding non-linear constraints. If you assume the polygon is regular, it gets quite easy of course, but the configuration space isn't very rich.  Ideally I'd like to support at least some amount of concave polygons.

I'm just not sure what so search for or how to frame the problem mathematically.","I'm not exactly sure how to describe what I want, so if I butcher terms, please forgive me :) I want to ""parameterize"" the space of simple ir regular equilateral polygons with n sides, or at least a large-ish subset of them.  That is, the user provides the number of edges in the polygon ($n$) and a set of parameters $[x_1, x_2, ... x_m]$ that satisfy some equalities and  inequalities (so $Ax \ge b, Cx = d$ for $A \in \mathbf{R}^{p \times m}, b \in \mathbf{R}^p, C \in \mathbf{R}^{q \times m}, d \in \mathbf{R}^q$).  For each valid configuration vector $x$ I want to be able to construct a unique equilateral $n$-gon.  I want the space of polygons I can construct to be as rich as possible. As an example, if $n$ is 3, then the only valid equilateral 3-gon is the equilateral triangle and the configuration space is basically empty so the whole thing is moot.  If $n$ is 4, then valid polygons are convex and shaped like kites, and there's basically only a single degree of freedom and I could use the width, say, as my configuration vector. For larger values of $n$, though, the obvious possibilities for $x$ start to break down.  For instance if you take the sum of the internal angles of the polygon and force them to add to $\pi (n - 2)$ you're not guaranteed that the ends meet up and form a complete circuit.  If you try to require that the ends meet up I don't see a way to express that as a linear equality.  (Notice that constructing the polygon doesn't have to be a linear operation.  Just that the constraints on the configuration vector are linear). Or if you assume the polygon is a star-shaped polygon, with the values of $x$ being the distances from some ""center"" point in the kernel to the vertices of the polyogn, I don't see a way to enforce the equilateral-ness of the polygon without adding non-linear constraints. If you assume the polygon is regular, it gets quite easy of course, but the configuration space isn't very rich.  Ideally I'd like to support at least some amount of concave polygons.  Limiting it to some large-ish subset of the equilateral star-shaped polygons would be reasonable, for instance.  But even being able to parameterize generic convex polygons (maybe as some intersection of half planes) would be interesting.
