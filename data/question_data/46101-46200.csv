This is a subring of $\mathbb{Q}$ with the usual multiplication and addition. I wonder if you could check my understanding of the units, irreducible elements, and prime elements in this ring. Assume all fractions are in simplest form. Units: For any element $\frac{a}{b} \in R$ either $a$ is odd or $a$ is even. If $a$ is odd, then $\frac{b}{a} \in R$ and $\frac{a}{b}\frac{b}{a}=1$. Hence, $\frac{a}{b}$ is a unit. If $a$ is even, then $\frac{b}{a}$ is not in $R$. There's no other possibility for an inverse, so $\frac{a}{b}$ is not a unit.

We now verify that $\cap F$ is an ideal by running back to the definition. $0$ is in $\cap F$ .

If anybody could give me some guidance I would greatly appreciate it."," G   G   \circ    G   \circ    e\in G   g \in G  \begin{align*}

43,Tensor product of rings: well-definedness of multiplication,Tensor product of rings: well-definedness of multiplication,,"Let $R$ and $S$ be rings, and let $T$ be a ring with ring homomorphisms $\alpha: T \to R$ , $\beta: T \to S$ . (None of these rings are assumed to be commutative.) Since $R$ and $S$ contain subrings that are isomorphic to quotients of $T$ , we may view them as $T$ -bimodules. Let $\varphi : R \times S \to R \otimes_T S$ be the $T$ -balanced map $\varphi(r, s) = r\otimes s$ . We want to turn the tensor product into a ring. The ring multiplication behaves exactly how you would expect on elementary tensors: $(r\otimes s) \cdot (r^\prime\otimes s^\prime) = (rr^\prime)\otimes(ss^\prime)$ . We then extend it to sums of elementary tensors by distribution. Unfortunately, I can't seem to convince myself that this is well defined. My first idea was to invoke the universal property of the tensor product to show that if $r^\prime \otimes s^\prime = r^{\prime\prime}\otimes s^{\prime\prime}$ , then $(rr^\prime)\otimes (ss^\prime) = (rr^{\prime\prime}) \otimes (ss^{\prime\prime})$ . To this end I defined $f: R \times S \to R \otimes_T S$ by $f(x, y) = (rx) \otimes (sy)$ , where $r \in R$ and $s \in S$ are fixed. However, this does not seem to be $T$ -balanced in general, so the universal property is of little help. Another option is to instead define $f(x, y) = (rx) \otimes (ys)$ . This map is $T$ -balanced, but the induced map $R \otimes_T S \to R \otimes_T S$ only seems to show that $x \otimes y = x^\prime \otimes y^\prime \implies (rx)\otimes (ys) = (rx^\prime) \otimes (y^\prime s)$ , which isn't quite what we want.

In case when $H$ is finite, a double transversal for $H$ can be built the following way: Suppose $g \in G$ is an arbitrary element. Then the double coset $HgH$ can be represented as union of the right and left cosets from the collections $R = \{Hgh' | h' \in H\}$ and $L = \{hgH | h \in H\}$ respectively.

Prove that $\alpha$ is in the field $\mathbb{Q}(\beta)$ generated over $\mathbb{Q}$ by $\beta = \alpha + \frac{1}{\alpha}$ . I'm not quite sure how to approach this one. If $\alpha$ is an element of odd degree over $\mathbb{Q}$ , I know that the corresponding minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ has odd degree, call it $n$ . Then, since $\alpha$ is algebraic of degree $n$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ , my idea was to show that $\beta$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{Q}$ of degree greater than $n$ . Then, this would mean that $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ is actually a subfield of $\mathbb{Q}(\beta)$ , and so it would follow that $\alpha$ is contained in the field $\mathbb{Q}(\beta)$ . How can I show that $\beta$ is algebraic of degree greater than $n$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ ? Does this amount to exploiting the equation $\beta = \alpha + \frac{1}{\alpha}$ ? I don't automatically know that, for example, $\alpha^n = 0$ , so I wasn't sure how to do this to prove what I want.

64,Definition of principal $G$-bundle might be missing details or have implicit assumptions on actions on each trivializing open set,Definition of principal -bundle might be missing details or have implicit assumptions on actions on each trivializing open set,G,"My book is Connections, Curvature, and Characteristic Classes by Loring W. Tu (I'll call this Volume 3), a sequel to both Differential Forms in Algebraic Topology by Loring W. Tu and Raoul Bott (Volume 2) and An Introduction to Manifolds by Loring W. Tu (Volume 1). I refer to Section 27.1 (part 1) , Section 27.1 (part 2) and Section 27.1 (part 3) . Firstly: I believe the book has no explicit definition for an action $\mu$ to be ""transitive"" and neither does Volume 1. I think this is okay for the book since Proposition 27.6 is not (explicitly) used later on in the book. 1.1. If this wouldn't be okay for the book, then I would ask how, if possible, we could deduce from Tu's definition of principal $G$ -bundle that from the action $\mu: P \times G \to P$ , we get that $\mu(P_x \times G) \subseteq P_x$ , where $P_x := \pi^{-1}(x)$ , which is saying something like $\mu$ is fiber-preserving, such that we can define an action $\mu_x: P_x \times G \to P_x$ and then begin to discuss whether or not each $\mu_x$ is transitive. 1.2 Even though I'm not asking (1.1), what I'm about to ask has a similar underlying problem. Anyway, I assume the definition that an action $\mu$ is ""transitive"" is the one here , assume that definition is equivalent to the one on Wikipedia and assume that that both definitions are equivalent to ""for each $x \in M$ , the map $\mu_x : G \to M, \mu_x(g) = \mu(x,g)$ , is surjective, where $\mu: M \times G \to M$ is the right action of $G$ on $M$ "". Now: Tu's definition of principal $G$ -bundle doesn't say anything about transitive or fiber-preserving, but it may be equivalent to a definition with transitivity (see here ). I mean that transitive or fiber-preserving could be somehow deduced from Tu's definition (as stated). Tu's definition is possibly the ""Definition 3"" in the previous link ). I guess the alternative is that Tu made a mistake in the definition of principal $G$ -bundle. I actually notice that for each $U \in \mathfrak  U$ , while we are given an explicit action $\sigma_U: U \times G \times G \to U \times G$ , which is $\sigma_U((x,h),g)=(x,hg)$ , we are not given an explicit definition of the action $\zeta_U: P_U \times G \to P_U$ , where $P_U := \pi^{-1}(U)$ . 4.1. Edit : Oh wait that was kind of wrong. What I meant was to say that $\zeta_U$ is not even declared to exist in the first place. I really think the text is unclear here. I think the text should've said something like "" $G$ acts on $U \times G$ (in the way of $\sigma_U$ ), and then $G$ acts on $\pi^{-1}(U)$ in such a way that $\phi_U$ is invariant"". Otherwise, it seems kinda weird that you just say a map is equivariant even though you haven't declared the existence of an action on both domain and range. It just seems that somehow the action $\mu$ on $P$ induces $\zeta_U$ 's. 4.1.1. Edit : Probably, there should even be some prior proposition that starts with ""given a map $f: N \to M$ and action $\zeta$ by $G$ on $N$ we can define an action $\sigma$ by $G$ on $M$ "" or that starts with ""given a map $f: N \to M$ and action $\sigma$ by $G$ on $M$ we can define an action $\zeta$ by $G$ on $N$ "" and then the next part would be ""that makes $f$ equivariant"" and then there might be another proposition or some exercise that says that the defined $\zeta$ or $\sigma$ is unique. I'm thinking of something similar to the pullback metric , from earlier in the book . 4.1.2. Edit : A comment of autodavid : In the definition of principal $G$ -bundle, the way in which $G$ is acting on $P$ should make the trivialization maps $G$ -equivariant when restricting to a trivialization patch..... Oh okay, there would be some problem because we don't know whether the restrictions are legal. I'm not an expert but I guess Tu implicitly requires that the restrictions to be legal, by talking about equivariance. I'm expecting something like, for the action $\mu: P \times G \to P$ , we get that 5.1. $\mu(P_x \times G) \subseteq P_x$ and $\mu(P_U \times G) \subseteq P_U$ such that we can define, respectively,  maps $\mu_x: P_x \times G \to P_x$ and $\mu_U: P_U \times G \to P_U$ . These turn out to be actions, probably smooth actions. 5.2. Each $\mu_x$ in (5.1) is transitive. (Well, this is what Proposition 27.6 says.) 5.3. $\zeta_U = \mu_U$ : Each $\mu_U$ in (5.1) is the action $\zeta_U$ used to determine whether or not $\varphi_U$ is $G$ -equivariant Questions : Is this definition of principal $G$ -bundle missing some details, such as any notion (explicit or implicit) of fiber-preservation of the action $\mu: P \times G \to P$ or any explicit description of the actions $\zeta_U: P_U \times G \to P_U$ ? 1.1 Edit : Or any explicit mention of the relationship between $\zeta_U$ 's and $\mu$ 1.2 Edit : Or mention of some kind of proposition that tells us the $\zeta_U$ 's, which may or may not be related to $\mu$ , are unique provided $\phi_U$ equivariant and $\sigma_U$ given as such If the definition is in fact not missing any (explicit or implicit) notion of fiber-preserving ( Edit : fiber-preserving or trivializing-open-subset-preserving ) of the action $\mu: P \times G \to P$ because we can somehow deduce some kind of notion of fiber-preserving ( Edit : fiber-preserving or trivializing-open-subset-preserving ) of the action $\mu$ or that any of (5.1),(5.2) or (5.3) is true, then which are true, and how do we deduce these? Are $\zeta_U$ and $\sigma_U$ necessarily smooth based on Tu's definition (as stated)? If not, then, based on other definitions of (smooth) principal $G$ -bundle that you know, are $\zeta_U$ and $\sigma_U$ likely intended to be smooth? I think I was able to prove $\sigma_U$ 's are smooth by writing each $\sigma_U$ as a combination of maps, by compositions and multiplication of maps, where the maps include various projection maps and the law of composition on the Lie group $G$ . To clarify, the $\sigma_U$ 's are free and transitive right? I think this follows from what I believe is the freedom and transitivity of the left multiplication group action of any group on itself based on its law of composition . Update: Can we just omit $\mu$ in the definition and then just later make a proposition about $\mu$ in the following way? I'm thinking we instead first define that for each $U \in \mathfrak U$ , $G$ acts on $U \times G$ on the right, still by the given $\sigma_U$ and then we say that $G$ acts on $\pi^{-1}(U)$ by some smooth right action $\zeta_U$ (I guess we don't have to include free or transitive since $\sigma_U$ is free and transitive and then freedom and transitivity are preserved under bijective equivariant or whatever), where $\zeta_U$ satisfies some compatibility condition like $\zeta_U|_{U \cap V} = \zeta_V|_{U \cap V}$ for all $V \in \mathfrak V$ makes $\phi_U$ is $G$ -equivariant. Later , we can make a propositions Lemma A . $\phi_U$ is $G$ -equivariant if and only if the $\zeta_U$ is given by $$\zeta_U(e,g) = \phi_U^{-1}(\sigma_U(\phi_U(e),g)) = \phi_U^{-1} \circ \sigma_U \circ ([\phi_U \circ \alpha_U] \times \beta_U) \circ (e,g), \tag{A*}$$ where $\alpha_U: \pi^{-1}(U) \times G \to \pi^{-1}(U)$ and $\beta_U: \pi^{-1}(U) \times G \to G$ are projection maps.

(The Submodule Criterion) Let $R$ be a ring and let $M$ be an $R$-module. A subset $N$ of $M$ is a submodule of $M$ if   and only if (1) $N \neq \emptyset$, and (2) $x + ry \in N$ for all $r \in R$ and for all $x, y \in N$. This proposition states that $R$ is simply a ring, not that it has identity. In the next definition, they specifically state ""a commutative ring with identity."" In the definition of a module at the beginning of the section, they emphasize that $R$ is ""not necessarily commutative nor with 1."" However, the proof proceeds as follows: Proof: If $N$ is a submodule, then $0 \in N$ so $N \neq \emptyset$. Also $N$ is closed under addition and is sent to itself under the action of   elements of $R$. Conversely, suppose (1) and (2) hold. Let $r = -1$   and apply the subgroup criterion (in additive form) to see that $N$ is   a subgroup of $M$. In particular, $0 \in N$. Now let $x = 0$ and apply   hypothesis (2) to see that $N$ is sent to itself under the action of   $R$. This establishes the proposition. Clearly, by letting $r = -1$, this proof assumes that $R$ has identity. Now, consider $R = 4\mathbb{Z}$, which is a ring without identity. Then, $4 \mathbb{Z}$ acts on the set $M = \mathbb{Z}$ by $r \cdot m = rm$, that is, by normal multiplication. Clearly, distributivity and associativity are inherited, so $\mathbb{Z}$ is a left $4\mathbb{Z}$-module. Take $N = 4\mathbb{Z} \cup (3 + 4\mathbb{Z})$, that is, the subset of integers congruent to $3$ or $0$ modulo $4$. Certainly, $N \neq \emptyset$. If $x, y \in N$, then $x + ry \equiv x \pmod{4}$, for any $r \in R$, so that $x + ry \in N$. Therefore, by Proposition 1, $N$ should be a $4\mathbb{Z}$-submodule of $\mathbb{Z}$. But $N$ is not an abelian group because $3 \in N$ but $-3 \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$ is not in $N$. I have checked the errata, but I did not see this listed.

So I have $O_E\cong\varprojlim\frac{O_E}{\pi^nO_E}$ isomorphic as $O_K$ module. How do I inherit algebraic structure? Note that I have provided a $O_K$ module map. I need a ring map now. This is related to pg 106 of Taylor, Frohlich Algebraic Number Theory's algebraic proof of uniqueness of absolute value. My current guess is that first $O_E\cong O_E\otimes_{O_K}O_K$. Since $O_K$ is complete, I know $O_E\otimes_{O_K}O_K\cong O_E\otimes_{O_K}\hat{O_K}$. So $O_E\otimes_{O_K}\hat{O_K}\cong\varprojlim\frac{O_E}{p^nO_E}$. Then inherit ring structre from $O_E\otimes_{O_K}\hat{O_K}$ side.",,"['abstract-algebra', 'number-theory', 'algebraic-number-theory']"
