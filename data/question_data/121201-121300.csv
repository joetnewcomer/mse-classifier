2,Is there a way to determine the cheapest way to cut a line if each cut costs the current length of a line?,Is there a way to determine the cheapest way to cut a line if each cut costs the current length of a line?,,"I was reading through an example question for the UNSW Computing ProgComp and found a question they claimed to be impossible to solve without going through all possible solutions. From https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~progcomp/pop.php?loc=2014opentasks#task5 : You have a length of timber that needs to be cut into several pieces. The points where the cuts have to be made are marked on the timber, measured from one end. The only precision cutting company available at short notice charges, for each cut, a rate in dollars equal to the length of the piece (being cut) in metres before cutting. The order in which the cuts occur affects the total price. For example, a piece 10m long with cuts needed at 4m, 5m and 7m could be cut first at 5m, costing \$10, leaving two 5m sections requiring one cut each, a total of \$10 + \$5 + \$5 = $20. However if the cuts are made at 4m, 7m and 5m the total cost is \$10 + \$6 + \$3 = $19."" ... There is no shortcut computational strategy that can generate the optimal cost in all cases, though heuristics may work sometimes. Instead you should try all possible cut sequences. Small-scale problems can be solved by a simple recursive design, but will take an inordinate amount of time for larger numbers of cuts as the number of small, repeated subproblems escalates exponentially. Solving large problems of this kind requires a technique called dynamic programming , where the the first time each small subproblem is solved, the solution is stored in an array or hash, representing a solution cache. When the same subproblem needs to be solved again the cache is first inspected, thus avoiding possibly thousands of recalculations.

Now it is dilated, that is zoomed in, or enlarged while keeping it's center as well as orientation fixed, so that the new ellipse trisects the sides of the triangle. So what is the ratio of the lengths of the major axes of the new ellipse to the previous one? And here is what I could gather from what I knew: The inscribed ellipse or 'inellipse' of the largest area that can be inscribed in a triangle is known as the Steiner inellipse and many of it's properties are known. The properties that might help us here are that it is tangent to the triangle sides at it's midpoints, the lengths of it's axes can be determined by the formula (g = semi major axis length, h = semi minor axis length) $${g=\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2+2Z}/6}$$ $${h=\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2-2Z}/6}$$ where $${Z=\sqrt{a^4+b^4+c^4-(ab)^2-(bc)^2-(ca)^2}}$$ and the centroid of the triangle is it's center. So now we can find the two foci of the ellipse by the concept that the angle bisector of the angle formed by the normal and the tangent to the ellipse at  point passes through the focus. So we simply find the angle bisectors at the 3 points of tangency, because we know the equations of the tangent's and normal there, and then find the intersection points of these 3 angle bisectors. They will thus determine 2 points which are the foci of the inellipse. So the line joining them must be the major axis of the ellipse. Now when we extend the ellipse to make it trisect the 3 sides of the triangle it passes through 6 known points, and we know of a way to find the equation of a unique ellipse given 5 points of the ellipse. From here we can find out the equation of the new ellipse, and it's major axis will be the same line as the major axis of the previous ellipse because we have only dilated it, keeping orientation fixed. But we already know the equation of the major axis of the previous ellipse. So we solve the equation of the second ellipse and the equation of the major axis to get the coordinates of the vertices of the ellipse.

I have to construct a point D such that it is intersection of the line AB and a line which is perpendicular to the line AB and points C and D lies on this perpendicular line. I can only use compass and can't link (match) the points. It's on the picture. Thanks for any help.,,"['geometry', 'geometric-construction']"

The idea is not just that one figure is congruent with another, since congruent figures can be in different places.

88,Missing solution in quadratic equation,Missing solution in quadratic equation,,"This is a reformulation of this question to better fit this forum. I removed the mentioning of sage math and this question is now 100% math. Given, the following quadrilateral: I want to describe the position of point X in terms of a multiple $t$ of the vector $HG$. The points $H$ and $G$ themselves are described by multiples $s$ of the vectors $DC$ and $AB$, respectively. We end up with the following equations: $$ X = H + t(G-H) \\ H = s(C-D)+D \\ G = s(B-A)+A \\ $$ As an example, lets take the following quadrilateral: $$ A=(1,2) \\ B=(3,2) \\ C=(2,0) \\ D=(0,0) \\ $$ We want to find $s$ and $t$ describing the point $X=(1.25,0.5)$ in the quadrilateral. Here a sketch of the geometric setup: One can easily see that $X$ cuts $HG$ at $t=0.25$ and that $H$ and $G$ cut $DC$ and $AB$ at $s=0.5$, each. This is also affirmed by inserting $s=0.5$ and $t=0.25$ into the formulas above. It will result in $H=(1,0)$ and $G=(2,2)$ and $X=(1.25,0.5)$ (the original point). Now I want a formula which, given any point $X$ inside the quadrilateral gives me $s$ and $t$. To that end I rearrange the above three formulas and solve for $s$ and $t$. After plugging in $H$ and $G$ into $X$, there are two equations, one for the x-coordinates and one for the y-coordinates of the points. Since there are two missing variables $s$ and $t$ this should be solvable. Since the derivation is super lengthy I started out with letting sage math solve it for me. I wrote about my experience and failure in this question I already mentioned above. To rule out any problem with sage math I ended up doing it by hand. Here is the derivation for $s$: $$ X = H + t(G-H) \\ H = s(C-D)+D \\ G = s(B-A)+A \\ s = \frac{X_x +t(D_x- A_x) - D_x}{C_x-D_x+t(B_x-A_x-C_x+D_x)} \\ t = \frac{X_y +s(D_y- C_y) - D_y}{A_y-D_y+s(B_y-A_y-C_y+D_y)} \\ $$ Plugging in $t$ into $s$ we arrive at a quadratic equation (my full derivation exists but is commented out for readability - it is the same solution sage math gives): $$ 0 = as^2 + bs + c \\ s_{1,2} = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} \\ a = (D_x-C_x)(B_y-A_y-C_y+D_y)-(D_y-C_y)(B_x-A_x-C_x+Dx) \\ b = (D_y-A_y)(C_x-D_x)+(X_x-D_x)(B_y-A_y-C_y+D_y)-(X_y-D_y)(B_x-A_x-C_x+D_x)-(A_x-D_x)(D_y-C_y) \\ c = (A_y-D_y)(X_x-D_x)-(A_x-D_x)(X_y-D_y) \\ $$ As you can see, one ends up with a quadratic equation with parameters $a$, $b$ and $c$ given in the last lines. My derivations should be correct because as far as I can see they equal the result I got in sage math. Now, when one plugs in the example values for $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$ into $a$, then the result will be zero. This will result in a division by zero. My question: clearly from a geometric point of view, there is a solution for $s$ and $t$ for the example values of $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$. Why is there none when solving the equation for $s$ and $t$? And more practically: how can I determine $s$ and $t$ for any given $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$ and $X$ without running into this problem? If I can find the solution for this, then it would solve this question . Here the values $a$, $b$ and $c$ that solve $0=at^2+bt+c$: $$ a = (D_y-A_y)(B_x-A_x-C_x+D_x)-(D_x-A_x)(B_y-A_y-C_y+D_y) \\ b = (D_y-A_y)(C_x-D_x)+(X_y-D_y)(B_x-A_x-C_x+D_x)-(X_x-D_x)(B_y-A_y-C_y+D_y)-(C_y-D_y)(D_x-A_x) \\ c = (C_x-D_x)(X_y-D_y)-(C_y-D_y)(X_x-D_x) \\ $$ Unsurprisingly, the solution for $t$ works analogous to $s$.","This is a reformulation of this question to better fit this forum.

If $n=2$, show that $G$ is either cyclic or dihedral (that is $D_4=\mathbb Z/2\times\mathbb Z/2$, and for $n\ge3$, $D_{2n}$ is the full symmetry group of a regular $2n$-gon.) I am struggling to show both parts. Any help will be appreciated, especially as these are the two results I am using later in other questions.",,"['group-theory', 'geometry']"

97,On non-Euclidean geometry,On non-Euclidean geometry,,"Wandering around Wikipedia, I came across the idea that if we violate the parallel postulate, we arrive at new, non-Euclidean geometries. Specifically, if you violate it in one direction, you get elliptic geometry, and in the other direction you get hyperbolic geometry. It's a fascinating idea, but Wikipedia doesn't say a whole lot about it. I've spent a few weeks turning the idea over in my mind, and I now think I understand it. Basically I want to write down how I think it works, and have someone tell me whether I'm correct or not. However, I'm having trouble not making this into a 50-page essay that nobody will ever read! As best as I can understand it, it's a question of space. Elliptic geometry doesn't have enough of it. Hyperbolic geometry has too much of it. Let me explain... Euclidean geometry is the geometry of flat space. If you take a flat sheet of paper, cut wedges out of it, and glue the edges together, it forces the paper to curve. If you follow that curve far enough, it naturally closes into a complete sphere. Sure enough, if two ships set sail from the north pole on different headings, initially the distance between the two ships grows linearly, just like Euclidean geometry would suggest. However, by the time they reach the equator, they are actually sailing parallel to each other, and after that they actually sail towards each other. (Question: Is elliptic space finite in size? If you travel in a straight line for long enough, do you end up back where you started?) Basically, as you travel outwards, elliptic geometry has ""too little space"", compared to what you would expect from Euclidean geometry. Hyperbolic geometry is harder to think about; the Earth is spherical, but I'm not aware of any simple real-world shape that is hyperbolic. But, logically, if elliptic geometry is the geometry of missing space, hyperbolic geometry ought to be the geometry of too much space. That is, as you travel outwards form a point, you find too much space around you. I don't know exactly ""how much"" extra space, but more than you would expect. (Question: What's the formula for the circumference of a circle in elliptic geometry and in hyperbolic geometry?) This suggests that if two ships set sail towards each other, provided they start off far enough apart and the angle between them is shallow enough, the ""extra space"" that keeps materialising as they travel onward potentially means they could actually miss each other - which would explain why you can have more than one parallel line. At some point, the angle becomes sharp enough that the ships' paths do cross, but at any shallower angle, they will miss. (And there are infinity such angles.) Is any of this correct? Or an I barking up the wrong tree?","Wandering around Wikipedia, I came across the idea that if we violate the parallel postulate, we arrive at new, non-Euclidean geometries.
