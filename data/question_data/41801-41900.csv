If $f: M\to N$ is $A$-module homomorphism, then the following statements are equivalent: 1) $f$ is injective. 2) The induced map $f_{\mathfrak{m}}: M_{\mathfrak{m}}\to N_{\mathfrak{m}}$ is injective for every maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ of $A$. Now, if we let $M=I$ and $N=J$ (as ideals of $A$ are naturally $A$-modules), then the inclusion map $i: I\to J$ is injective. So, the induced maps $i_{\mathfrak{m}}: I_{\mathfrak{m}}\to J_{\mathfrak{m}}$ are also injective, for each maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ of $A$. Now I would like to use the fact that $I$ and $J$ have same extensions in $A_{\mathfrak{m}}$. Can this approach be made to work?

Exercise 10.8.3 : Let $R$ be a commutative ring and $C$ a bounded complex of finite $\mathrm{Tor}$ -dimension over $R$ . Show that there is a natural isomorphism in the derived category $\mathsf{D}(R-\mathrm{Mod})$ : $$ \mathbf{R}\mathrm{Hom}_R(A,B) \otimes^{\mathbf{L}}_R C \cong \mathbf{R}\mathrm{Hom}_R(A,B \otimes^{\mathbf{L}}_R C ). $$ How I got stuck : I feel that the general way to prove such problems is in two steps: Degenerate the desired isomorphism to the zeroth degree and prove the zeroth degree version. Use the composition theorem for derived functors (i.e. $\mathbf{R}(GF) \cong \mathbf{R}G \circ \mathbf{R}F$ ) to upgrade to the derived version. At least for most exercises and theorem I have met, the thing works smoothly: Example 1 : To show $$ \mathbf{R}\mathrm{Hom}_R(A,\mathbf{R}\mathrm{Hom}_R(B,C)) \cong \mathbf{R}\mathrm{Hom}_R(A \otimes^{\mathbf{L}}_R B, C )  \quad\quad (\star), $$ we first degenerate it to the zeroth degree as $$ \mathrm{Hom}_R(A, \mathrm{Hom}_R(B,C)) \cong \mathrm{Hom}_R(A \otimes_R B, C). $$ This is the clear adjoint isomorphism. Then we view both sides as composed functors in $B$ .

72,Definition of the Weil group: Question about exact sequence with Inertia Group and absolute Galois group over a local field,Definition of the Weil group: Question about exact sequence with Inertia Group and absolute Galois group over a local field,,"Let $K$ be a local field, $k$ be its residue field, $G_K, G_k$ be the absolute Galois groups of $K, k$ and $I_K$ be the inertia group of $K$. In several books and papers, I found the following exact sequence: $$ 1 \longrightarrow I_K \longrightarrow \ G_K \longrightarrow G_k \longrightarrow 1. $$ Now I would like to know why because my motivation is it to understand the definition of the Weil group $W_K$. If I recall correctly, this is defined by the exact sequence $$ 1 \longrightarrow I_K \longrightarrow W_K \longrightarrow \mathbb{Z} \longrightarrow 0,$$ but I did not understand every detail of it. First, let me assemble what I understood (or not understood entirely): I heard that $G_k$ is isomorphic to $\hat{\mathbb{Z}} = \varprojlim\limits_n \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$. I think this follows from the fact that $k$ is a finite field and the absolute Galois group is a profinite group but I was not yet able to put these facts together. Anyway, I think that $\mathbb{Z}$ is a subgroup of $\hat{\mathbb{Z}}$ but I do not know how the embedding would look like. One defines $W_K$ to be the inverse image of $\mathbb{Z}$ under the map $\phi: G_K \to \hat{\mathbb{Z}} $.

As the first sequence is exact, this must mean that $I_K$ is the kernel of some map $G_K \to G_k$ resp. $G_K \to \hat{\mathbb{Z}}$. But I do now know how this map would look like.

77,Fields having exactly one quadratic extension (up to isomorphism),Fields having exactly one quadratic extension (up to isomorphism),,"Let $F$ be an infinite field such that $F$ has, up to field isomorphisms$^{[1]}$, exactly one extension $K/F$ of degree $2$. Does it imply  that $[\overline F : F]<\infty$ ? What happens if $F$ has characteristic $0$? I don't think that this holds, even if characteristic $0$, but I didn't have an example of a field $F$ of characteristic $0$ ($\implies F$ is infinite) such that $[\overline F : F] = \infty$ and in $F^*$, any product of two non-squares is a square, and there is at least one non-square (see 4) below). My thoughts: 1) The only example of such $F$ I know is $\Bbb R$: any quadratic extension embeds in $\Bbb C$, which has already degree $2$ over $\Bbb R$. My question is to know if other examples exist: if $[\overline F : F]<\infty$ then (by Artin-Schreier theorem) $F$ is a real closed field . 2) Any finite field $\Bbb F_q$ has exactly one extension of degree $n$ (namely $\Bbb F_{q^n}$), up to field isomorphisms, for every $n \geq 1$. 3) It implies that all the quadratic extensions are isomorphic as fields, but this is not sufficient, precisely when $F$ has no quadratic extension , e.g. $\overline F=F$ (or $\bigcup_{n \geq 0} K_n$, with $K_0=\Bbb Q,K_{n+1}=\{x \in \Bbb C \mid x^2 \in K_n\}$). 4) In characteristic different from $2$, any quadratic extension of $F$ is separable and has the form $F(\sqrt a)$ where $\sqrt a \not \in F$. Therefore, as mentioned here , the quadratic extensions of $F$ correpond to $A:=F^* / F^{*,2}$ where $F^{*,2} = \{x^2 \mid \in F^*\}$.  Notice that $A$ is a $\Bbb F_2$-vector space, via $[a]_2 \cdot [x]_{F^{*,2}} = [x^a]_{F^{*,2}}$. So the most interesting case is when we are looking for fields of characteristic $\neq 2$ such that $A=F^* / F^{*,2}$ has order $2$ . Equivalently, in $F^*$, any product of two non-squares is a square, and there is at least one non-square (because $x,y$ non squares $\implies x,1/y$ non-squares $\implies x/y = a^2 \in F^{*,2} \implies [x]_{F^{*,2}} = [y]_{F^{*,2}}$). Let $a$ be a non-square in $F^*$ and let $i = \sqrt a$. Showing that $F(i)$ is algebraically closed is not reasonable. Notice that this condition about $[F^* : F^{*,2}]=2$ is involved in 3. here , which is precisely the situation where $a=-1$ is not a square. Then I thought to some extension $F$ of $K=\mathrm{Frac}(\Bbb R[x,y]/(x^2+y^2+1))$ since $-1$ is not a square in $K^*$ but is a sum of squares ; we just need $[F^* : F^{*,2}]=2$, and then it's a counterexample, since $F$ won't be a formally real field . I only know how to do $[F^* : F^{*,2}]=1$, see my $K_n$'s in 3). 5) I tried $F = \overline{\Bbb F_2}(t)$, because $t^{1/n}$ has degree $n$ for any $n$, so $[\overline F :F]=\infty$.

However, in characteristic $2$ , it is not clear that all quadratic extensions arise as $F(\sqrt a)$ for some non-square $a \in F$. 6) In characteristic 0 (at least $\neq 2$), it is not clear that $F(\sqrt{t+1}) \not \cong F(\sqrt t)$. If there was a field isomorphism, then there is $u \in  F(\sqrt t)$ such that $u^2=t+1$, hence there are $a,b \in F[t]$ such that $(a(\sqrt t)/b(\sqrt t))^2 = t+1$, which yields $a(x)^2=(x^2+1)b(x)^2$ as polynomials in $F[x]$... $^{[1]}$ I'm only interested in fields isomorphisms, not in ""field extensions"" isomorphisms (i.e. not in $F$-algebras isomorphisms – these are equivalent to saying that $f : K \stackrel{\cong}{\to} K'$ commutes with the embeddings $i : F \to K$ and $i' : F \to K'$).","Let $F$ be an infinite field such that $F$ has, up to field isomorphisms$^{[1]}$, exactly one extension $K/F$ of degree $2$.

However, I can't seem to find a solvable series for $\mathbb{Z}$, for example $\mathbb{Z},2\mathbb{Z},6\mathbb{Z},\ldots$ will not terminate in the identity group. Someone said that $\mathbb{Z},\left\{0\right\}$ is a solvable series for $\mathbb{Z}$. Is this a definition set by Hungerford since $\mathbb{Z},\left\{0\right\}$ is not even a composition series : $\mathbb{Z}/\left\{0\right\}$ is not a simple group.",,"['abstract-algebra', 'group-theory', 'abelian-groups', 'solvable-groups']"
98,Symmetric groups on sets with the same number of elements are isomorphic,Symmetric groups on sets with the same number of elements are isomorphic,,"Continuing my work through Abstract Algebra by Dummit and Foote, I'm stuck on what is probably a very easy proposition: Let $\Delta$ and $\Omega$ be nonempty sets. The symmetric groups $S_\Delta$ and $S_\Omega$ are isomorphic if $|\Delta| = |\Omega|$ The proof is outlined in the text, then exercise 1.6.10 asks the reader to ""fill in the details"" by: Let $\theta : \Delta \rightarrow \Omega$ be a bijection. Define $\varphi : S_\Delta \rightarrow S_\Omega$ by $\varphi(\sigma) = \theta \circ \sigma \circ \theta ^{-1}$ for all $\sigma \in S_\Delta$ (a) $\varphi$ is well-defined, that is, if $\sigma$ is a permutation of $\Delta$ then $\theta \circ \sigma \circ \theta ^{-1}$ is a permutation of $\Omega$. I thought I knew what ""well-defined"" meant ($x = y \rightarrow f(x) = f(y)$ ), but this doesn't seem anything like that. My best guess at how to prove this is: $\theta ^{-1}$ is a bijection from $\Omega$ to $\Delta$, then $\sigma$ is a bijection from $\Delta$ to itself, then $\theta$ is a bijection from $\Delta$ to $\Omega$. Is that correct? Thanks. I think I can get the rest*, but I'll add to this question if need be. * (b) $\varphi$ is a bijection from $S_\Delta$ onto $S_\Omega$. [Find a two-sided inverse for $\varphi$], and (c) $\varphi$ is a homomorphism, that is $\varphi(\sigma \circ \tau) = \varphi(\sigma) \circ \varphi(\tau)$ Added for (b), I used $\varphi ^{-1}(y) = \theta ^{-1} \circ y \circ \theta$ for $y \in S_\Omega$. I showed that this is indeed an inverse since: $\varphi^{-1}(\varphi(\sigma)) = \theta^{-1} \circ (\theta \circ \sigma \circ \theta^{-1}) \circ \theta = \sigma$, and likewise for the reverse composition. And (c) was simply a matter of writing an equality using the definitions of the expressions on each side.","Continuing my work through Abstract Algebra by Dummit and Foote, I'm stuck on what is probably a very easy proposition: Let $\Delta$ and $\Omega$ be nonempty sets.
