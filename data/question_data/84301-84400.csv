One QFT book I looked at exhibited an explicit definition of $δJ[f]/δf(x)$, apparently obtained from the above definition by setting $η(y) = δ(y-x)$ = (Dirac delta ""function"" representing a unit impulse at x). Is such a legitimate choice for the variation $η$? Certainly the delta function is not an allowed test functions in elementary distribution theory. Other than that, what kind of problems would choosing η(y) = δ(y-x) create?",,['functional-analysis']

37,A normal operator is the continuous functional calculus of an adjoint operator,A normal operator is the continuous functional calculus of an adjoint operator,,"Let $H$ be a hilbert space and suppose $T \in B(H)$ is a normal operator.

Writing $f$ as $f(t)=f_1(t)+if_2(t)$ , the continuity of $f$ implies that $f_1$ and $f_2$ are both continuous, also the definition of $K$ and the above equation tells us that $(0,1] \subset \sigma(S)$ .

This is obviously true if additionally $t\mapsto \|f(t)\|$ is measurable and in $L^1$, but does it hold more generally?","This is related to a question of MO: A question on the integral of Hilbert valued functions .    I'm sure it's easy, but I cannot think right now, so I thought I'd ask. Let $f:[0,1]\rightarrow H$ be a map to a Hilbert space, such that for each $x\in H$, the map $t\mapsto (f(t)|x)$ is Lebesgue measurable, and in $L^1([0,1])$.  Thus we can define a map $$F:H\rightarrow\mathbb C; \quad F(x) = \int_0^1 (x|f(t)) \ dt$$ This is linear, but it's not obviously bounded.  The MO question seems to suggest that it should be bounded; if so, then there is $y\in H$ with $\int_0^1 (x|f(t)) \ dt = (x|y)$ for all $x$, and we denote $y = \int_0^1 f(t) \ dt$ the Pettis integral. What bothers me is that all the sources I can Google (for ""Pettis integral"") seem to assume that $y$ exists (or put strong conditions, e.g. continuity, on $f$).  My guess is that a Hilbert space is sufficiently nice that I can somehow prove that $y$ exists (equivalently, that $F$ is continuous).  This is obviously true if additionally $t\mapsto \|f(t)\|$ is measurable and in $L^1$, but does it hold more generally?",,"['measure-theory', 'functional-analysis', 'hilbert-spaces']"

(For simplicity, let $\F \in \{\R,\C\}$ .) Let $\n\cdot$ be a norm on $X$ , and let $f : X \to \F$ be a bounded linear functional. Norm of Functionals: Recall that we can define the norm of $f$ by $$\n f := \sup_{\substack{x \in X \\ x \ne 0}} \frac{\abs{f(x)}}{\n x} = \sup_{\substack{x \in X \\ \n x = 1}} \abs{f(x)}$$ Hyperplanes & $H_1$ : Define now a hyperplane as follows. Let $Y$ be a subspace of $X$ with $\mathrm{codim} \; Y := \dim X/Y = 1$ . The elements of the quotient space $X/Y$ are called hyperplanes parallel to $Y$ . In particular (cf. Kreyszig's Introduction to Functional Analysis , exercise $2.9.12$ ): if $f \ne 0$ is a functional on $X$ , then the set $H_1$ defined by $$H_1 := \Big\{ x \in X \; \Big| \; f(x) = 1 \Big\}$$ is a hyperplane parallel to the null space of $f$ , $$\mathcal N(f) := \Big\{ x \in X \; \Big| \; f(x) = 0 \Big\}$$ That is to say, since $\mathrm{codim}\, \mathcal N(f) = 1$ (as $f \ne 0$ ), then $H_1$ is parallel to $\mathcal N(f)$ , and $H_1 \in X/\mathcal N(f)$ . The Property of Concern: Another exercise in Kreyszig ( $2.9.14$ ) then gives the following property: within the previous circumstances, we may write $$\n f = \frac{1}{\displaystyle \inf_{x \in H_1} \n x}$$ Alternatively, taking the convention of a distance between a point $x$ and a set $S$ in a metric space with metric $d$ to be $$d(x,S) := \inf_{s \in S} d(x,s)$$ then we may equivalently write $\n f$ as being the reciprocal of the distance from the origin (or zero vector) and the hyperplane $H_1$ , i.e. $$\n f = \frac{1}{d(0,H_1)}$$ Of course in our context the distance (between points) is that induced by the norm, i.e. $$d(x,y) := \n{x-y}$$ My Question: Normally it is very hard for me to imagine what the norm of a functional or operator might look like in the sense that norms generalize the Euclidean length/magnitude of vectors that we're used to.

This space is a normed vector space with the following norm :  $$ \Vert[x]\Vert = \inf \{ \Vert y \Vert \, | \, y \in [x] \}.  $$ Define $[T] : E / \mathrm{Ker}(T) \to \mathrm{Im}(T)$ by $[T]([x]) = T(x)$. Suppose that $\mathrm{Im}(T)$ is closed. Show that $[T]$ is an homeomorphism (i.e. its inverse is linear and continuous. Now here's the deal ; this question turns out to be hard (and most probably false) because my teacher did a typo and hence forgot to mention that $E$ was supposed to be a Banach space for this question to work out. So I worked for a few days on it and only managed to show the following : $[T]$ is an homeomorphism if and only if $E/\mathrm{Ker}(T)$ is a Banach space. If $E/\mathrm{Ker}(T)$ is not Banach (i.e. not complete), there exists a Cauchy sequence $\{ [y_n] \}$ such that $\Vert [y_n] \Vert \to A > 0$ but $[T]([y_n]) \to 0$. Now here is my question. Can anyone find a counter example to show that this exercise is false (which is most probably the case), or prove it otherwise (which I have no hope in doing)?","Here's a question in one of our exercises list : Let $E$ be a normed vector space, $F$ be a Banach space and $T : E \to F$ a continuous linear application.
