1,Is there a better bound than $(n^2)^{n^3}$ for the order of the commutator subgroup of a group whose center has index $n?$,Is there a better bound than  for the order of the commutator subgroup of a group whose center has index,(n^2)^{n^3} n?,"Let $G$ be a group and $[G:Z(G)]=n<\infty,$ where $Z(G)$ is the center of $G$. A theorem says that in this case $$o([G,G])\leq(n^2)^{n^3}, $$ where $o(\cdot)$ denotes order and $[G,G]=G'$ is the commutator subgroup of $G$. The bounds from the proof seem crude and I would like to ask if we can improve upon the result. Of course, the theorem is valuable with any bound because it implies that $G'$ is finite. Proof. We have exactly $n$ cosets $\{x_iZ(G)\}_{i=1}^n$. We will be using the representatives $x_i.$ Let $$c_{ij}=[x_i,x_j]=x_i^{-1}x_j^{-1}x_ix_j.$$ First, we note the following Lemma 1. $$\{c_{ij}\,|\,i,j=1,...,n\}=\{[x,y]\,|\,x,y\in G\}.$$ Proof of lemma. For $x,y\in G$ we have some $i,j\in\{1,...,n\}$ and $z_1,z_2\in Z(G)$ such that $$x=x_iz_1\text{ and }y=x_jz_2.$$ Then $$ \begin{eqnarray} [x,y]&=&x^{-1}y^{-1}xy=z_1^{-1}x_i^{-1}z_2^{-1}x_j^{-1}x_iz_1x_jz_2\\ &=& (x_i^{-1}x_j^{-1}x_ix_j)(z_1^{-1}z_1z_2^{-1}z_2)\\ &=& x_i^{-1}x_j^{-1}x_ix_j\\ &=& [x_i,x_j]. \end{eqnarray} $$ Lemma 2. For $x,y\in G$ we have $$[x,y]^{n+1}=[x,y^2][y^{-1}xy,y]^{n-1}.$$ Proof of lemma. Since $G/Z(G)$ has order $n$, we have $[x,y]^n\in Z(G)$. Therefore $$ \begin{eqnarray} [x,y]^{n+1}&=&x^{-1}y^{-1}xy[x,y]^n\\ &=& x^{-1}y^{-1}x[x,y]^ny\\ &=& x^{-1}y^{-1}x(x^{-1}y^{-1}xy)[x,y]^{n-1}y\\ &=& (x^{-1}y^{-2}xy^2)y^{-1}[x,y]^{n-1}y\\ &=& [x,y^2][y^{-1}xy,y^{-1}yy]^{n-1}\\ &=& [x,y^2][y^{-1}xy,y]^{n-1} \end{eqnarray} $$ Proof cont'd. Let $g\in G'.$ It is a product of a a finite number $m$ of elements $c_{ij}$ (with possible repetitions) because $[x,y]^{-1}=[y,x]$ and so we do not need to consider inverses. Suppose $m>n^3$. We have $$\operatorname{card}(\{c_{ij}\,|\,i,j=1,...,n\})\leq n^2$$ so some element $c_{ij},$ say $c=[x,y],$ must appear at least $n+1$ times in the product. There is no reason to believe however that $c^{n+1}$ occurs in the product since the occurances of $c$ may be scattered. We fix it by noting that for any $x',y'\in G$ we have $$[x',y'][x,y]=[x,y]c^{-1}[x',y']c=[x,y][c^{-1}x'c,c^{-1}yc].\tag1$$ This allows us to rewrite $g$ as a product of commutators which begins with $[x,y]^{n+1}:$ $$g=[x,y]^{n+1}c_{n+1}c_{n+1}...c_{m}.$$ But this equals $$[x,y^2][y^{-1}xy,y]^{n-1}c_{n+1}c_{n+1}...c_{m},$$ which is a product of $m-1$ commutators. Repeating this procedure, we can decrease the number of factors to $n^3.$ Therefore we can write any element of $G'$ as a product of at most $n^3$ commutators. We recall that there can be at most $n^2$ distinct commutators in $G$ and therefore there are at most $(n^2)^{n^3}$ elements in $G'.$ EDIT I have laid my hands on a copy of Passman's book on group rings and I see that the theorem and the proof come from it.

Question Is there a combinatorial rule that captures whether or not a given stack of bricks would be stable? In particular, that no small vertical force will cause the stack to move. In other words, how can one determine whether or not a configuration is stable without doing a static force analysis. (Admittedly, this question is a little hand-wavey, so let me know if I can clarify anything.)

11,Arrange Relatively Prime Numbers in a Circle,Arrange Relatively Prime Numbers in a Circle,,"The question: In how many ways can you arrange the numbers $1$ to $8$ in a circle so that neighboring numbers are relatively prime? Can you generalize for $1$ to $n$? It's fairly easy to list all possible arrangements for the numbers $1$ to $n$ when $n \leq 7$; however, beyond this it is hard to do it by hand. I've tried approaching the problem in three ways, but none of them have got me any success (for either the general case or the special one). Consider the graph with vertices numbered $1, 2, \dotsc, n$. In this graph, there is an edge between two distinct vertices iff their numbers are relatively prime. For example, $1$ will be connected to all other vertices, $2$ to all odd numbers, etc. Then, the number of Hamiltonian cycles in this graph is our answer. Another way to look at the problem is by recursion. Given an arrangement of $n-1$ vertices, the $n^{\text{th}}$ vertex (with the number $n$) can be inserted on an edge where both neighbors are relatively prime to it. Thus the edge will be split into two. To solve the problem, we have to solve the recurrence. But note that the initial arrangement of $n-1$ vertices does not have to have all neighbors relatively prime; the condition is that either all neighbors are relatively prime, or there is exactly one relatively non-prime pair such that both numbers are relatively prime to the inserted number $n$. A third way is by making 'trees' for the choices of each next vertex. We start at $1$: there are $n-1$ branches for each of the $n-1$ remaining numbers. For each of the branches, there are further branches for each of the remaining numbers relatively prime to that branch, and so on. Counting the number of ways to get to the bottom of this tree will give us an answer. Edit: As in @Mark Main's answer, this approach is equivalent to making 'option sets' for a given number: starting from 1, choose any number in its option set, then choose any number from that number's option set, and so on. This is a good way to deal with the problem programmatically , but I can see no other advantage for the solution. Sorry for making it so long, but I thought it's better if I put up all my attempts.

Note that $V$ has $2^n$ elements and $\mathcal P(V)$ has $2^{2^n}$. I'm interested in the probability (under a uniform distribution) that an element of $\mathcal P(V)$ is a spanning set for $V$. Equivalently a closed form formula (or at least one who's asymptotics as $n\rightarrow \infty$ are easy to work out) for the number of spanning sets or non-spanning sets.

Balls&Boxes If we bring the matrix on the LHS we get: $$ \left( \begin{matrix} 0 &0&0&0&1\\ 0&0&0&1&4\\ 0&0&1&2&6\\ 0&1&2&5&12\\ 1&4&6&12&24\\ \end{matrix} \right) \left( \begin{matrix} m_{4,0,0,0}\\ m_{3,1,0,0}\\ m_{2,2,0,0}\\ m_{2,1,1,0}\\ m_{1,1,1,1}\\ \end{matrix} \right)= \left( \begin{matrix} e_{4}\\ e_3e_1\\ e_2^2\\ e_2e_1^2\\ e_1^4\\ \end{matrix} \right)\tag{*} . $$ Maybe it's easier to interpret these values, since they are all positive, in terms of balls, that have to be put into boxes, according to the following rules : You are given $N$ balls. Your balls are now divided into parts (and bless god that, this is a math forum :-) according to a partition $\mu$. These are the products of $e_k$'s. Now you are asked to put the balls partition-by-partition into a $N$ boxes. It is not allowed to put more than 1 ball in a box for the current partition. The goal is to achieve a certain distribution of balls among the boxes, given by $\lambda$. These are the $m_\lambda$. Power Sums Or would it help to express $e_k$ as power sums via Newton-Girard formulas? Here is the worked out example: $$ \left( \begin{matrix} m_{4,0,0,0}\\ m_{3,1,0,0}\\ m_{2,2,0,0}\\ m_{2,1,1,0}\\ m_{1,1,1,1}\\ \end{matrix} \right)= \left( \begin{matrix} 0& 0& 0& 0& 1\\  0& 0& 0& 1 &-1\\ 0& 0& 1/2& 0& -1/2\\ 0& 1/2& -1/2& -1& 1\\ 1/24& -1/4 &+1/8 &1/3 &-1/4\\ \end{matrix} \right) \left( \begin{matrix} p_1^4\\ p_2p_1^2\\ p_2^2\\ p_3p_1\\ p_4^1\\ \end{matrix} \right) $$",,"['combinatorics', 'algebraic-geometry', 'polynomials', 'symmetric-functions']"

For example, with a $3-\text{snake}$ we can make the following (among others): Suppose we start at the black dot and we place the snake, coding each $n$ placements in a string of letters. We first code the direction of the first module, as $N$, $E$, $W$ or $S$, and from there on, we note wether we're placing the module at $0º$ (straight), $90º$ (leftwards) or $-90º$, (rightwards). As an example, let's code the four configurations above (left to right, left to right) $$E:SS$$ $$E:RR$$ $$E:SR$$ $$E:RL$$ Suppose also, that the snake can't run into itself, that is: from $n\geq4$, we can't have a string composed of $n-1$ $R$s or $n-1$ $L$s, since that will mean our snake will run into itself. Given this rules, can we combinatorially find a way of computing the possible configurations of an $n-\text{snake}$? I guess we can just leave the orientation aside and then multiply by $4$.

84,Ballot counting when ties occurs exactly $r$ times,Ballot counting when ties occurs exactly  times,r,"Ballot Problem with Fixed Number of Ties: Problem Statement : In an election, candidate A receives $m$ votes and candidate B receives $n$ notes. Let $m \ge n$. In how many ways can the ballots be counted so that ties occur exactly $r$ times ($r \le n$)? Example : $m = 3, n = 2, r = 1$. There are 4 such scenarios: for order ABAAB, BAAAB the tie occurs at the 2nd vote; for order AABBA, BBAAA the tie occurs at the 4th vote. Call this number $Z( m,n, r)$. My practical goal is to answer the following:  Given the total number of votes $N$, how many ways can we order the ballots to have exactly $r$ ties? It is  \begin{equation} Z(N,r) = \sum_{n = r}^{N/ 2} Z( N-n, n ,r ) + \sum_{n = r}^{N/ 2} Z( n, N-n ,r ) \end{equation} once we figure out $Z(m,n,r)$. It would be nice if one can get $Z(N,r)$ or its generating function directly, but I think the ""$r$-tie"" ballot problem is interesting on its own. Mapping to lattice path enumeration Here is an equivalent form of the problem: Consider lattice path from $(0,0)$ to point $(m,n)$ with only up $(0,1)$ or right $(1,0)$ movement in $m +n $ steps. Excluding the starting point $(0,0)$, how many lattice paths hit the (lattice point on the) diagonal line $y = x$ exactly $r$ times? The following figure shows a lattice path that reaches (4,3) and its image under Andre's reflection. It hits the diagonal 3 times. $r = 0$ is the strictly monotonic path The $r = 0$ problem can be solved by Andre's reflection principle . (method used here is similar to this ME post ) First of all $m > n$, otherwise the end point $(n,n)$ will be one touching point. Since no touching of the diagonal is allowed, the first step must go right. There are ${ m + n - 1 \choose m-1}$ such paths but we need to exclude the ones that touches the diagonal. Suppose there is one such path (first step going right) that touches the diagonal, we can do reflection about the $ y= x$ line for the path between the origin and the first intersection (see Figure). The reflected path is one that starts with up movement. Since such paths will definite cross the diagonal line to reach $(m,n)$, it is easy to see that the map is one-to-one. There are ${m+n -1 \choose n - 1}$ such paths. In sum, the result is \begin{equation} Z( m, n, 0) = { m + n - 1 \choose m - 1 } - {m+n -1 \choose n - 1} = { m + n - 1 \choose n } - {m+n -1 \choose n - 1} \quad m > n  \end{equation} which is very similar to the ballot theorem . Any idea of approaching the general $r$? Thanks! Update 1: $m = n, r = 1$ is the strictly monotonic Dyck path The only intersection is at the end point $(n,n)$, so this is basically a Dyck path that hits the diagonal once. This ME post gives the general result for a Dyck path to hit the diagonal $k$ times. Setting $k$ = 1, the result is $\frac{1}{n}{2n - 2 \choose n-1 }$. Here the path can be either above or below the diagonal line, hence a factor of $2$, \begin{equation} Z( n, n, 1 ) = \frac{2}{n}{2n - 2 \choose n-1 } \end{equation} Update 2: number of lattice paths that crosses the diagonal $k$ times Call this number $C( m, n, r )$. Kern, Malcolm; Walter, Stanley , Ballot theorem and lattice path crossings , Can. J. Stat. 6, 87-90 (1978). ZBL0387.60018 . gives the result \begin{equation} C( m,n, r ) = \left\lbrace   \begin{aligned}     &\frac{2(r+1)}{n} {2n \choose n - r -1 } & m = n \\     &\frac{m - n + 2r + 1}{m + n + 1} { m + n +1  \choose n - r } & m > n \\ \end{aligned}   \right. \end{equation} This is a relevant but different problem. Notice the difference between ""touch"" and ""cross"". Only going from one side of $y=x$ to the other is considered as a ""cross"". In the ballot problem, this is a change of the leading candidate, not a tie.

In our lecture notes it states that: Suppose $G$ is a finite permutation group which acts on $A$, and for each $g\in G$ let $A^g$ denote the subset of $A$ fixed by $g$. The number of orbits, denoted $|A/G|$ is $$|A/G| = \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G} |A^g|$$ I'm quite confused with a few points due to the fact that I haven't yet done a course on group theory (group theory is not a prerequisite for this combinatorics paper) so our lecturer said that we don't need to understand the notation above as long as we know how to apply burnside's  lemma using cycle index terms etc. I'd like to know in a concrete setting, what the set $A$ is? (Or you can give me a different/another example). Our lecturer proved burnside's lemma using a double counting argument and to help as understand what the set $A$ he gave us an example of $A$ being the set of all $2$ colorings of a cube with a string on the center of one of the faces where we color only $4$ of the faces (so the face opposite the face with the string doesn't count in the colouring). To illustrate what I mean take this cube http://uva.onlinejudge.org/external/2/253img1.gif and say the string is on face $1$ and face $6$ doesn't have a coloring.
