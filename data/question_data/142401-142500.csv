1,Difficult limit of expression involving logarithms,Difficult limit of expression involving logarithms,,"I'm trying to calculate the limit $$ L=\lim_{n \to \infty} \left (\ln^2(n)\ln \left (\frac{\ln(\frac{n}{t})}{\ln(\frac{n}{t+1})}\right )-\ln(n)\ln \left (1+\frac{1}{t} \right) \right),$$ where $t$ is a fixed positive integer, but have so far been unsuccessful. I have reason to suspect that $$L=\frac{1}{2}\ln \left (1+\frac{1}{t}\right )\ln \Big(t(t+1) \Big)=\frac{1}{2} \Big(\ln^2(t+1)-\ln^2(t) \Big) \hspace{15mm} (\ast)$$ because (1).

Let $$F(n):=\ln^2(n)\ln \left (\frac{\ln(\frac{n}{t})}{\ln(\frac{n}{t+1})}\right )-\ln(n)\ln \left (1+\frac{1}{t} \right).$$ For simplicity, we may take $n=e^m$ , so that $$F^*(m)=m^2\ln \left (\frac{m-\ln(t)}{m-\ln(t+1)}\right )-m\ln \left (1+\frac{1}{t} \right)$$ and \begin{equation}\exp(F^*)=\frac{\left(\frac{m-\ln(t)}{m-\ln(t+1)} \right )^{m^2}}{(1+\frac{1}{t})^{m}}= \left(\frac{t}{t+1} \right )^m\left(\frac{m-\ln(t)}{m-\ln(t+1)} \right )^{m^2}\end{equation} I do not know how to calculate the limit of this as $m \to \infty$ . One could substitute $a=\frac{t}{t+1}$ and then set $b=\ln(a)$ . The result is (any of) these expression: $$a^{m} \left (1+\frac{\ln(a)}{x-\ln(t/a)} \right )^{m^2} =e^{bm} \left(1+\frac{b}{x+b-\ln(t)}\right )^{m^2}=e^{bm} \left(1+\frac{b}{x-\ln(t+1)}\right )^{m^2}.$$ If we pick, say the rightmost expression above and take the logarithm, the problem is reduced to calculating the limit $$\lim \limits_{m \to \infty} \left(bm+m^2\ln \left (1+\frac{b}{m-\ln \left( t+1 \right ) } \right ) \right )$$ $$=\lim \limits_{m \to \infty} m\left(b+\ln \left (\left[1+\frac{b}{m-\ln \left( t+1 \right ) } \right )\right]^{m} \right)$$ $$=\lim \limits_{m \to \infty} m \left( b+ \ln \left ( \left[ 1+\frac{b}{m-\ln(t+1) } \right]^{m-\ln(t+1)} \left[ 1+\frac{b}{m-\ln(t+1) } \right]^{\ln(t+1)} \right) \right)$$ which does at least have the appearance of a simpler problem.

Hopefully a more intuitive one! Here's what I had in mind: $$\underset{x\rightarrow0}{\lim}\big(a^{x}+b^{x}-c^{x}\big)^\frac{1}{x}=\underset{x\rightarrow0}{\lim}e^{\ln{\big((a^{x}+b^{x}-c^{x})^\frac{1}{x}\big)}}=\underset{x\rightarrow0}{\lim}e^\frac{\ln{\big(a^{x}+b^{x}-c^{x}\big)}}{x}$$ Since $e^x$ is continuous and therefore we have: $$\underset{x\rightarrow{x_0}}{\lim}e^{f(x)}=e^{\underset{x\rightarrow{x_0}}{\lim}f(x)}$$ So we focus on finding: $$\underset{x\rightarrow0}{\lim}\frac{\ln{\big(a^{x}+b^{x}-c^{x}\big)}}{x}$$ Suppose it is equal to some $L$ , then our original limit will be equal to $e^L$ . We now note that: $$\underset{x\rightarrow0}{\lim}x=0\space,\space \underset{x\rightarrow0}{\lim}\ln{\big(a^{x}+b^{x}-c^{x}\big)}=\ln{(a^0+b^0-c^0)}=\ln{(1+1-1)}=\ln(1)=0$$ So our limit takes the indeterminate form $""\frac{0}{0}""$ . After checking all the conditions are satisfied we proceed with L'Hospital setting $g(x)=x$ and $f(x)=\ln{\big(a^{x}+b^{x}-c^{x}\big)}$ , and get the following: (oh boy this is going to be an ugly) $$\underset{x\rightarrow0}{\lim}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=\underset{x\rightarrow0}{\lim}\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}=\underset{x\rightarrow0}{\lim}\frac{\frac{a^{x}\ln{(a)}+b^{x}\ln{(b)}-c^{x}\ln{(c)}}{a^{x}+b^{x}-c^{x}}}{1}=\ln{(a)}+\ln{(b)}-\ln{(c )}=\ln{\big(\frac{ab}{c}\big)}$$ (Again, the computation was straightforward because $\ln$ is continuous and the limit of composition of functions).

As you can see it's not that intuitive, and it involves a lot of computation and some theorems and identities and as a result- many steps.

The question: Suppose that $f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$. If $$\lim_{n \to \infty}[f(n+1)-f(n)] =L$$ prove that $\lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{f(n)}{n}$ exist and equals $L$. My answer: Define $g(n):= f(n+1)-f(n)$ then $g(n-1)=f(n)-f(n-1)$ and so $f(n) = g(n-1)+f(n-1)$. We can recursively apply this to get $f(n)=g(n-1)+g(n-2)+ \cdots +g(0) +f(0)$. Then for $k \ge N_0$ we can  make $|g(k) - L| < \epsilon_0$ which gives $L-\epsilon_0 <g(k)<L+ \epsilon_0$. Also note that $f(N_0) = f(0) + g(0) + \cdots + g(N_0 -1)$ is just some number say $d \in \mathbb{R}$. Now $f(N_0 + n) = d + g(N_0) + g(N_0 +1) + \cdots + g(N_0+n-1)$ and so using the above bound for $g(k)$ with $k \ge N_0$ we can bound $f(N_0+n)$ as follows:$$d+n(L-\epsilon_0) < f(N_0+n)<d+n(L+\epsilon_0)$$ $$\frac{d}{n} +L-\epsilon_0 < \frac{f(N_0+n)}{n}<\frac{d}{n} +L+\epsilon_0$$ $$\frac{d}{n} -\epsilon_0 < \frac{f(N_0+n)}{n}-L<\frac{d}{n}+\epsilon_0$$ We can take $n$ large enough so that $|\frac{d}{n}| < \frac{\epsilon}{2}$. Also take $\epsilon_0 = \frac{\epsilon}{2}$ and we have shown that the limit of $\frac{f(N_0+n)}{n} = L$. If we define $h(n) = \frac{f(N_0+n)}{n}$ then $h(x_n)$ will go to $L$ for every $x_n$ that goes to infinity as $n$ does. So take $x_n = n-N_0$ and we have $\lim_{n \to \infty}h(n-N_0) =L= \lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{f(n)}{n-N_0}$ dividing top and bottom by $n$ we see that: $$\lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{\frac{f(n)}{n}}{1-\frac{N_0}{n}}=\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{f(n)}{n} =L$$ I feel like I have missed something because this question is a lot more involved than all of the others I have done so far in the book.

If the statement is false, what should I notice to have a counterexample?","Let be a function such that for any , we have Prove or disprove: My claim: The statement is true because . In other words, I think since we can pick any , with , we can cover any neighbor of . (Either rational or irrational numbers near ). But, since the reasoning does not seem strong enough for me, I also thought of any counterexample of . So, I tried to construct a discontinuous function at , but I couldn't think of any counterexample. Is the statement really true? Then, how should I change (or improve) my reasoning to write it in clear mathematical terms?
