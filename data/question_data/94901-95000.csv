19,Rudin's Construction of Lebesgue Measure,Rudin's Construction of Lebesgue Measure,,"Self-studying Rudin's RCA, and I want to make sure I am understanding the intricacies of his construction of the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$. The uniform continuity of $f$ shows that there is an integer $N$ and   functions $g,h$ with support in $W$ such that: (i) $g,h$ are constant   on each box in  $\Omega_N$, (ii) $g \leq f \leq h$, (iii) $h-g <  \epsilon$. What is the simplest way to construct such functions? My first thought was to consider $\operatorname{cl}(A)$ of a box $A \in \Omega_N$ and apply the Extreme Value Theorem to obtain a maximal and minimal value of $f(x)$. Setting $h,g$ as those maximum and minimum values for $x \in A$, respectively, then gives (i),(ii). The Uniform Continuity Lemma then gives (iii) via an appropriate choice of $N$. This however strikes me as a needlessly complicated construction; I am confident Rudin had something simpler in mind. Property 2.19c then shows that: $$\forall n > N, \quad \Lambda_N g =  \Lambda_n g \leq \Lambda_n f \leq \Lambda_n h = \Lambda_N h$$ This seems to follow if we partition $P_n$ into the boxes $P_n \cap A$. But once again it seems that some simpler methodology would be applicable. Thus the upper and lower limits of $\{\Lambda_n f\}$ differ by at most   $\epsilon \operatorname{vol}(W)$, and since $\epsilon$ was arbitrary   we have proved the existence of $$\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} \Lambda_n f = \Lambda f$$ Using the formalism described above, no natural way to establish this limit suggests itself, but this should be remedied by superior ways of establishing the above claims. More specifically, we obtain that $$\lim\limits_{\epsilon \to 0} \;(\limsup\limits_{n \to \infty} \Lambda_n f - \liminf\limits_{n \to \infty} \Lambda_n f) = 0.$$ How precisely to we formally proceed from the above to equality of the inferior and superior limits, and therefore convergence? Any insight would be greatly appreciated.","Self-studying Rudin's RCA, and I want to make sure I am understanding the intricacies of his construction of the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$. The uniform continuity of $f$ shows that there is an integer $N$ and   functions $g,h$ with support in $W$ such that: (i) $g,h$ are constant   on each box in  $\Omega_N$, (ii) $g \leq f \leq h$, (iii) $h-g <  \epsilon$. What is the simplest way to construct such functions? My first thought was to consider $\operatorname{cl}(A)$ of a box $A \in \Omega_N$ and apply the Extreme Value Theorem to obtain a maximal and minimal value of $f(x)$. Setting $h,g$ as those maximum and minimum values for $x \in A$, respectively, then gives (i),(ii). The Uniform Continuity Lemma then gives (iii) via an appropriate choice of $N$. This however strikes me as a needlessly complicated construction; I am confident Rudin had something simpler in mind. Property 2.19c then shows that: $$\forall n > N, \quad \Lambda_N g =  \Lambda_n g \leq \Lambda_n f \leq \Lambda_n h = \Lambda_N h$$ This seems to follow if we partition $P_n$ into the boxes $P_n \cap A$. But once again it seems that some simpler methodology would be applicable. Thus the upper and lower limits of $\{\Lambda_n f\}$ differ by at most   $\epsilon \operatorname{vol}(W)$, and since $\epsilon$ was arbitrary   we have proved the existence of $$\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} \Lambda_n f = \Lambda f$$ Using the formalism described above, no natural way to establish this limit suggests itself, but this should be remedied by superior ways of establishing the above claims. More specifically, we obtain that $$\lim\limits_{\epsilon \to 0} \;(\limsup\limits_{n \to \infty} \Lambda_n f - \liminf\limits_{n \to \infty} \Lambda_n f) = 0.$$ How precisely to we formally proceed from the above to equality of the inferior and superior limits, and therefore convergence?

48,Solving $\int_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{d\phi}{2+\sin(\phi)}$ with complex exponentials,Solving  with complex exponentials,\int_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{d\phi}{2+\sin(\phi)},"I’m working through the textbook A First Course in Complex Analysis and I’m trying to solve problem 4.30: Compute the real integral $$\int_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{d\varphi}{2+\sin(\varphi)}$$ by writing the sine function in terms of the complex exponential and making the substitution $z=e^{i\varphi}$ to turn the real integral into a complex integral. I started by rewriting the sine function as $\frac{e^{i\varphi}-e^{-i\varphi}}{2i}$ : $$=\int_{0}^{2\pi} \frac{d\varphi}{2+\tfrac{e^{i\varphi}-e^{-i\varphi}}{2i}}=2i\int_{0}^{2\pi} \frac{d\varphi}{4i+e^{i\varphi}-e^{-i\varphi}}$$ Then I substituted $z=e^{i\varphi}$ , as the problem asked, and got $dz=izd\varphi$ , so $d\varphi=\tfrac{-idz}{z}$ .

My professor took away points due to lack of rigor in one of the equalities, and said to ask other mathematicians what they thought about the proof. My proof is as follows: We have that $$\frac{1}{\Gamma (s)} = e^{\gamma s}s \prod_{n = 1}^\infty \left(1 + \frac{s}{n}\right)e^{ - s/n} = e^{\lim_{N \to \infty} \sum_{k = 1}^N s/k - s\log N} s \prod_{n = 1}^\infty \left(1 + \frac{s}{n}\right) e^{- s/n}$$ The exponential terms cancel out as in the limit as $N \to \infty$ as we have that each term in the product is matched by a term from the Euler-Mascheroni term. Thus this equals $$\lim_{N \to \infty} e^{\log N^{-s}} s \prod_{n = 1}^\infty \left(1 + \frac{s}{n}\right) = \lim_{N \to \infty} s \prod_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{N^s} \left(1 + \frac{s}{n}\right)$$ $N = N/(N - 1) \cdot (N - 1)/(N - 2) \cdots 3/2 \cdot 2/1 = \prod_{n = 1}^N (1 + 1/n)$ , therefore as $N \to \infty$ we have that this equals $$s \prod_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{\left(1 + \frac{s}{n}\right)}{\left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)^s},$$ as desired. My professor said that this equality $$\lim_{N \to \infty} e^{\log N^{-s}} s \prod_{n = 1}^\infty \left(1 + \frac{s}{n}\right) = \lim_{N \to \infty} s \prod_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{N^s} \left(1 + \frac{s}{n}\right)$$ simply shows that $0 = 0$ and thus my argument is not rigorous. I was confused as to why this was because I only used standard rules involving limits and continuous functions, and it seems like the problems with the limit of $1/N^s$ approaching infinity are resolved in the proof of the equality that I started with (ch. 6, theorem 1/7) via the Hadamard factorization theorem.
