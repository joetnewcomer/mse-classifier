11,Find the real roots for $\displaystyle \sqrt[4]{386-x}+\sqrt[4]{x}=6.$,Find the real roots for,\displaystyle \sqrt[4]{386-x}+\sqrt[4]{x}=6.,"Find the real roots for $\displaystyle \sqrt[4]{386-x}+\sqrt[4]{x}=6.$ Question from a Math Olympiad (ES, 2005). Answer: $(3\pm \sqrt{2})^4$ . My attempt: I will make my attempt below, but I think the approach might be too complicated... are there simpler approaches? I started making the substitution $$u=\sqrt[4]{386-x},~~v=\sqrt[4]{x}$$ so that $u^4+v^4=386$ . Therefore we can define a system of 2 equations, in order to hopefully find $u$ and $v$ : $$\left\{  \begin{array}{l} u+v=6 \\  u^4+v^4=386\\  \end{array} \right. $$ If we use $p_k=u^k+v^k$ , $e_1=(u+v)$ and $e_2=uv$ , by Newton-Girard identities we get $$ \left\{  \begin{array}{l} p_4=e_1p_3-e_2p_2\\ p_3=e_1p_2-e_2p_1\\ p_2=e_1p_1-e_2\times 2\\ \end{array} \right. $$ But as we know that $p_1=e_1=u+v=6$ , we can make the substitutions backwards,  so that $$ \left\{  \begin{array}{l} p_2=36-2 uv\\ p_3=6(36-2uv)-6uv=216-18uv\\ p_4=6(216-18uv)-uv(36-2 uv)\\ \end{array} \right. $$ But, as we know that $p^4=u^4+v^4=386$ , so making the substitution $z=uv$ and some simplifications the last equation is equivalent to $$-z^2+72z-455=0.$$ Solving this last equation we find the roots $7$ and $65$ , therefore $uv$ will potentially have these two values. Now as we know that $u+v=6$ we can set a system to solve for $u$ and $v$ : $$ \left\{  \begin{array}{l} u+v=6\\ uv=7~~\text{or}~~65\\ \end{array} \right. $$ That can be solved noticing the $u$ and $v$ are the roots of $P(z)=z^2-(u+v)z+uv$ . When $uv=65$ , $P(z)$ has only complex roots. When $uv=7$ , $P(z)$ has 2 real roots.  When using $uv=7$ the roots $(u,v)$ for $P(z)$ are, by the symmetry, either $$(3-\sqrt{2},3+\sqrt{2})~~\text{or}~~(3+\sqrt{2},3-\sqrt{2}).$$ But as $x=v^4$ the final solution would be $$x=(3\pm \sqrt{2})^4=193\pm 132\sqrt{2}.$$ Both solutions comply with the initial restritions for the argument of the radicals: $0\le x\le 386$ .

21,On the Origin and Precise Definition of the Term 'Surd',On the Origin and Precise Definition of the Term 'Surd',,"So, in the course of last week's class work, I ran across the Maple function surd() that takes the real part of an nth root. However, conversation with my professor and my own research have failed to produce even an adequate definition of the term, much less a good reason for why it is used in that context in Maple.  Various dictionaries indicate that it refers to certain subsets (perhaps all of?) the irrationals, while the Wikipedia reference link uses it interchangeably with radical.  However, neither of those jive with the Maple interpretation as $\mbox{Surd}(3,x) \neq\sqrt[3]{x}\;\;\;\;\;\;\;x<0$. So, the question is: what is a good definition for ""surd""? For bonus points, I would be fascinated to see an origin/etymology of the word as used in mathematical context.","So, in the course of last week's class work, I ran across the Maple function surd() that takes the real part of an nth root.

Improve this question As a student in high school, I never bothered to memorize equations or methods of solving, rather I would try to identify the logic behind the operations and apply them. However, now that I've begun to teach Algebra in high school, I find it rather frustrating when students either a) memorize methods of solving the textbook problems or b) look for a general formula/method to ""just plug in to"" I've tried to throw them curveballs as my old Algebra teacher did, but usually they just dismiss it as ""a weird problem"" and continue using whatever method they have been. My objection to A is that it often impedes actual learning. Upon seeing a chunk of 6 similar problems in the textbook, many students just apply the same steps to every problem in the section (and usually get quite a couple wrong). My objection to B is that from my experience, students who flat out memorize equations (like $x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$ for quadratic equations) often fail to extend the same logic (completing the square/simplification) when faced with different but similar problems.
