4,product of divisors of n as a power of n.,product of divisors of n as a power of n.,,"I am trying to prove that  $$\prod_{d|n}{d}=n^\frac{d(n)}{2},$$ where $d(n)$ is the number of divisors of $n$.

10,Explicit Galois Action for $X^3 - X -1$,Explicit Galois Action for,X^3 - X -1,"I have always been frustrated with how indirect discussions of Galois Theory are in Algebra textbooks.   Even in fine treatments such as Miles Reid . Are there any good examples where we can draw the Galois action explicitly as substitutions?? One possibility are the cyclotomic polynomials : $$ x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 = 0 $$ Then for any $1 \leq a < 5$ we can make subsition $x \mapsto x^a$ and this polynomial is fixed. This gives me some intuition that the Galois action should behave something like the exponential operator and we often write $x \mapsto x^\sigma$ for $\sigma \in \mathrm{Gal}[p(x)]$ Iterating square roots is another examples such as $x = \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}$ and we should recover and explicit $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ action.

But basically, you could describe the function as: A relative measure of how far away a number is from the smallest number with the same number of digits. or A relative measure of how far a number 'x' is from the biggest power of 'b' that is still less than or equal to 'x' So anyways, if we set b=6, then apply f(x) to elements of Collatz orbits that have a length > 44, we see a cycle. It's easy to see this when you graph the points ( i , f(x) ) on a polar graph. i = the index of the element in the sequence x = the value at COLLATZ[ i ] where COLLATZ is an array created from the elements of the Collatz orbit starting at n and terminating at 1. Here is the graph for n = 27. The points are labeled ( i , COLLATZ[ i ]) It clearly cycles at 44. To test this hypothesis further, I tried graphing n = 670617279, which has 949 steps. Here is the result. I thought it may be simply because I was using polar coordinates, but I see similar symmetry when using cartesian coordinates. I think I'm on the verge of understanding why, but I just wanted to ask the community for any insight. I find it odd that 44 shows up.

My professor quick answer was: $$\mathbb{Z_{2016}^*} \cong \mathbb{Z_{32}^*} \times \mathbb{Z_{9}^*} \times \mathbb{Z_{7}^*} \cong (C_{8} \times C_{2}) \times C_{6} \times C_{6} \cong (C_{8} \times C_{2}) \times (C_{2} \times C_{3}) \times (C_{2} \times C_{3})  $$ Where $\mathbb{Z^*}$ is the group of units and $C_{n}$ is the cyclic group of order n. My question related to this part is why he did not use $C_{16}$ or $C_{4} \times C_{4}$ instead of $C_{8} \times C_{2}$ , could anyone explain this for me please? Then My professor added: ""then the number of solutions of the given congruence is $|C_{2} \times C_{2} \times C_{2} \times 1 \times  C_{2} \times 1 | = 2^4 =16$ "" I understand part of this part, he neglected the $C_{3}$ group as it will not contain elements of order 2 (which I do not know why? could anyone explain this for me please?).

Note: I have asked my professor but he answered these question in a very fast way so that I could not follow him. The steps my professor do before answering this number of solutions question are: He used the Euler-Phi function to find $\phi (2016) = 576 $ then he used Euler's theorem, then he noticed that $gcd(10, 576) = 2$ , so he ended up with the congruence $$x ^ {2} \equiv 1 \pmod {2016}$$ , and he said hence the order of of $x$ is either 1 or 2, but the identity element is the only element of order 1, so our $x$ has order 2, this is why we were searching for $C_{2}$ in the above isomorphisms.

97,"Find $x,y$ given $\gcd(x,y)$ and ${\rm lcm}(x,y)$",Find  given  and,"x,y \gcd(x,y) {\rm lcm}(x,y)","These two exercises I encountered recently seem to develop some type of connection between GCD and LCM I can't quite figure out. Exercise 1: Find all the numbers $x$ and $y$ such that: $a) \ GCD(x,y)=15, \ LCM(x,y)=150$ $b) \ GCD(x,y)=120 \ LCM(x,y)=1320$ $c) \ GCD(x,y)=100 \ LCM(x,y)=990$ Exercise 2: Find all the numbers $m,n$ such that $GCD(m,n)=pq , \ LCM(m,n)=p^2qs$ where $p,q,s$ are prime The first thing that is known to me is that $GCD(x,y) \cdot LCM(x,y)= x \cdot y$ Also $LCM(x,y)$ is at most $x \cdot y$ while $GCD(x,y)$ is at most $\max \{x,y\}$ . Last thing is that $GCD(x,y)|LCM(x,y)$ . Using all this I tried to solve the first exercise: $a)$ First two obvious pairs are $x=15, y=150$ and $y=15, x=150$ . Now neither of the numbers can be bigger than $150$ or smaller than $15$ . So we are looking for numbers in the range $15-150$ that satisfy $x \cdot y = 15 \cdot 150$ Another such pair is $(x,y)=(30,75), \ (x,y)=(75,30)$ . Similarly for $b)$ we find that the only possible values are permutations of the set { $120,1320$ } and in $c)$ since $100$ does not divide $990$ no such numbers exist. Now exercise 2 is what made me think there is actually another connection I'm not quite aware of since now it's about arbitrary prime numbers and the previous method doesn't work anymore.
