Thus, the weak- topology is the smallest topology on for which all evaluation maps are continuous. What is the definition of initial topology, how to understand the first statement? Why the weak- topology is the smallest topology on for which all evaluation maps are continuous? 3.There is also a conclusion: every subset of which is open for the weak- topology is also open for the strong topology. (1) I want to show that is continuous, but the book I refered mention that ""since all evaluation maps are continuous for the strong topology"", why can we prove (1) by the reason .","* x\in X \phi_x: X^*\to \Bbb R u\to u(x) x * X^* \phi_x: X^*\to \Bbb R * X^* \phi_x * X^* \phi_x X^* * (X^*,SOT)\rightarrow (X^*, \|\cdot \|) ""\cdots""","['general-topology', 'functional-analysis', 'operator-theory', 'topological-vector-spaces']"

Then, since $f_1 \circ \pi \in (E \times F)^\star$ , $(f \circ \pi)^{-1}(O_1) = \pi^{-1}(f_1^{-1}(O_1)) = f_1^{-1}(O_1) \times F \in \sigma(E\times F, (E \times F)^\star)$ for an open set $O_1$ in $\mathbb{R}$ .

Let $X$ be Hausdorff and $S:D\to X$ be a net in it where $D$ is a directed set. Let $S$ has two limits $x,y\in X$ . We need to prove that $x=y$ . Suppose $x\neq y$ , therefore by Hausdorffness, there exists $U,V$ open sets in $X$ containing $x,y$ respectively such that $U\cap V=\emptyset$ . Now by defintion of convergence, there exist $m_1,m_2\in D$ such that for all $n\in D$ , $n\geq m_1$ implies $S(n)\in U$ and $n\geq m_2$ implies $S(n)\in V$ .
