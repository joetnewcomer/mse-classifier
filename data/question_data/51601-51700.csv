0,What differential equation might model this almost-harmonic oscillator?,What differential equation might model this almost-harmonic oscillator?,,"I need to precisely control the motion of a damped, driven (nearly) harmonic oscillator: $$ \ddot x(t) + \alpha\dot x(t) + \omega_0^2 x(t) \approx V(t) $$ I use the $\approx$ symbol because this is a real-world system, and I'm convinced this equation of motion is not sufficiently accurate for my needs. Help me determine a more accurate mathematical model! The damping term $\alpha$ is positive, and small compared to the resonant frequency $\omega_0$ (approximately ten oscillations per decay half-time).  I can choose the driving term $V(t)$ arbitrarily, and I can measure $x(t)$ fairly precisely. In order to characterize my oscillator, I measured the impulse response $x(t)$ by setting $V(t)$ to (approximately) a delta function $\delta(t)$. The resulting behavior $x(t)$ fits fairly well to an exponentially decaying sinusoid, as expected : $$ V(t) \approx\propto \delta(t) $$ $$ x(t) \approx\propto e^{- k t} \sin\,(\omega t ) $$ I use the $\approx\propto$ symbols to express that my input $V(t)$ isn't perfectly proportional to a delta function (it's a square pulse much shorter than the resonant period of the oscillator), and my output $x(t)$ isn't perfectly proportional to a damped sinusoid (but it looks a lot like one over a few tens of oscillations). However, when I checked the impulse response for different impulse strengths, I got a surprise: my oscillator is nonlinear! The plot below shows impulse responses for several different impulse strengths, normalized by the impulse strength: The first cycle of oscillations match fairly closely, but the decay time of my oscillator depends strongly on the impulse strength! For example, changing the impulse strength from $1$ unit to $7$ units increased the decay time by a factor of $\sim 2$. Interestingly, the larger impulses seem to decay into the smaller impulses . The following plot shows the same data as the previous plot, except that the responses are not normalized. Instead, each response is shifted in time until it (approximately) lines up with the other responses: So, my system looks a lot like a damped harmonic oscillator, but the decay rate of the oscillation seems to increase as oscillation amplitude decreases. How should I modify my equation of motion to account for this behavior? What other measurements would be helpful to guide my choice? For example, it seems to me that my measurements are consistent with a damping that increases as velocity decreases: $$ \ddot x(t) + \alpha\dot x(t) + \beta\dot x(t)|\dot x(t)| + \omega_0^2 x(t) \approx V(t) $$ but my measurements might also be consistent with a damping that depends on position: $$ \ddot x(t) + \alpha\dot x(t) F(x)+ \omega_0^2 x(t) \approx V(t) $$ What measurements might help distinguish between these models? I can't change the system resonant frequency or the damping, but I can set $V(t)$ to whatever I want, as long as it doesn't break my oscillator by making $x(t)$ go too large. EDIT: vonbrand asked an excellent question in the comments: What does it matter what the ""right"" model is? I should be more clear about how accurate I need my model to be. I'm trying to achieve a particular output signal $x(t)$ from my oscillator. I wanted to use my measured impulse response to calculate what input signal $V(t)$ would give this output, as illustrated here: I'd like my actual output to match my desired output within a few percent for a few tens of resonant periods. In the small-signal limit, this seemed to be working: (ignore the banding artifact; that's what happens when someone opens the door during the measurement) This is the right shape for $x(t)$, but the wrong amplitude; I want to operate at larger amplitude. When I scale $V(t)$ up to higher values, though, this is what happens: This was actually the first hint that my oscillator was nonlinear, and lead to measuring impulse responses for different impulse strengths.","I need to precisely control the motion of a damped, driven (nearly) harmonic oscillator: $$ \ddot x(t) + \alpha\dot x(t) + \omega_0^2 x(t) \approx V(t) $$ I use the $\approx$ symbol because this is a real-world system, and I'm convinced this equation of motion is not sufficiently accurate for my needs.

8,The distribution of the inner product of a random complex normal vector.,The distribution of the inner product of a random complex normal vector.,,"Good day! I would like to find the distribution of the inner product of a random complex normal vector with: some constant vector; random gaussian vector. Let's assume a vector $\vec{z}$ which has a complex normal distribution with location parameter $\mu$, covariance matrix $\mathbf{\Gamma}$ and the relation matrix $\mathbf{C}$: $$\vec{z}=\{\Re{\vec{z}},\Im{\vec{z}}\}^{T}=\{z_1,z_2\ldots z_n\}^{T}\sim \mathit{CN}(\mu_{\vec{z}}, \mathbf{\Gamma},\mathbf{C})$$ So the pdf of $\vec{z}$ is: $$w_{\vec{z}}(z_1,z_2\ldots z_n)= \frac{1}{\pi^k\sqrt{\det(\mathbf{\Gamma})\det(\mathbf{\Gamma}-\mathbf{C^{H}}\mathbf{\Gamma^{-1}}\mathbf{C})}}\times\\ \times \exp\!\left[\!-\frac12 \begin{pmatrix} (\vec{z}-\mu_{\vec{z}})^{\ast}\!\!\!&\!\!\!(\vec{z}-\mu_{\vec{z}})\end{pmatrix}     \begin{pmatrix}\mathbf{\Gamma}&\mathbf{C}\\\mathbf{C^{H}}&\mathbf{\Gamma}^{\ast}\end{pmatrix}^{\!\!-1}\! \!\!                                 \begin{pmatrix} \vec{z}-\mu_{\vec{z}} \\ \vec{z}^{\ast}-\mu_{\vec{z}}^{\ast}\end{pmatrix} \right] $$ and a complex constant vector $\vec{a}=\{\Re{\vec{a}},\Im{\vec{a}}\}^{T}=\{a_1,a_2\ldots a_n\}^{T}$. I'd like to find the joint distribution of $(\Re{U},\Im{U})$ where $U=\vec{z}.\vec{a}^{\mathbf{H}}$ My attempt. First I can form a matrix $\mathbf{A}=\text{diag}\{\vec{a}^{\mathbf{H}}\}$ and using the property that $$Z\ \sim\ \mathit{CN}(\mu,\,\mathbf{\Gamma},\, \mathbf{C}) \quad\Rightarrow\quad AZ+b\ \sim\ \mathit{CN}(A\mu+b,\, A\mathbf{\Gamma} A^{\mathbf{H}},\, A\mathbf{C}A^{\mathbf{T}}) $$ and rearranging $U=\vec{z}.\vec{a}^{\mathbf{H}}$ as $U=\mathrm{tr}\left(\mathbf{A}\vec{z}\right)$ I can say that $\mathbf{A}\vec{z}\sim \mathit{CN}(\mathbf{A}\mu_{\vec{z}},\, \mathbf{A}\mathbf{\Gamma} \mathbf{A}^{\mathbf{H}},\, \mathbf{A}\mathbf{C}\mathbf{A}^{\mathbf{T}})$.

Let's call $$\mathbf{\alpha}=\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf{A}^{\ast}&\mathbf{0}\\\mathbf{0}&\mathbf{A}\end{pmatrix}, \ \mathbf{\alpha^{-1}}=\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf{A^{-1}}^{\ast}&\mathbf{0}\\\mathbf{0}&\mathbf{A^{-1}}\end{pmatrix}, \ \mathbf{R}=\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf{\Gamma}&\mathbf{C}\\\mathbf{C^{H}}&\mathbf{\Gamma}^{\ast}\end{pmatrix}, \ \underline{\vec{x}}=\begin{pmatrix} \vec{x}\\ \vec{x}^{\ast}\end{pmatrix}$$ Then the pdf can be rewritten as $$ w_{\mathbf{A}\vec{z}}(x_1,x_2\ldots x_n)= \frac{1}{\pi^{k}\prod^n_{i=1}|a_i|^{2}\sqrt{\det{\mathbf{R}}}}\exp\!\left[\!-\frac12  (\underline{\vec{x}}-\mathbf{\alpha}\underline{\mu_{\vec{z}}})^{\mathbf{H}}    \mathbf{\alpha^{-H}} \mathbf{R}^{\!\!-1}\mathbf{\alpha^{-1}} (\underline{\vec{x}}-\mathbf{\alpha}\underline{\mu_{\vec{z}}}) \right]  $$ then multiplying matrices inside the exponent I get $$ w_{\mathbf{A}\vec{z}}(x_1,x_2\ldots x_n)= \frac{1}{\pi^{k}\prod^n_{i=1}|a_i|^{2}\sqrt{\det{\mathbf{R}}}}\exp\!\left[\!-\frac12  (\mathbf{\alpha^{-1}}\underline{\vec{x}}-\underline{\mu_{\vec{z}}})^{\mathbf{H}}   \mathbf{R}^{\!\!-1}(\mathbf{\alpha^{-1}}\underline{\vec{x}}-\underline{\mu_{\vec{z}}}) \right] \!\!\!\tag{1} $$ But next I should find the distribution of the  sum of elements of $\mathbf{A}\vec{z}$ and here I'm stuck. In the second case one can set $\vec{a}$ to be gaussian with augmented mean vector $\underline{\mu_{\vec{a}}}$ and augmented covariance matrix $\mathbf{R_a}$ and pdf $$w_{\vec{a}}(a_1,a_2\ldots a_n)= \frac{1}{\pi^{k}\sqrt{\det{\mathbf{R_a}}}}\exp\!\left[\!-\frac12  (\underline{\vec{a}}-\underline{\mu_{\vec{a}}})^{\mathbf{H}}   \mathbf{R_a}^{\!\!-1}(\underline{\vec{a}}-\underline{\mu_{\vec{a}}}) \right] $$ Then one can treat $(1)$ as the conditional distribution of $\mathbf{A}\vec{z}$ given $\vec{a}$, so the unconditional distibution would be  $$ w_{\mathbf{A}\vec{z}}(x_1,x_2\ldots x_n)=\int w_{\mathbf{A}\vec{z}|\vec{a}}(x_1,x_2\ldots x_n|\vec{a})w_{\vec{a}}(a_1,a_2\ldots a_n)\mathrm{d \vec{a}}$$ Which (up to the scale factor) will look like $$ w_{\mathbf{A}\vec{z}}(x_1,x_2\ldots x_n)\!\!\propto \!\!\int \! \!\frac{1}{\prod^n_{i=1}|a_i|^{2}}  \!\exp\!\left[\!-\!\frac{(\mathbf{\alpha^{-1}}\underline{\vec{x}}\!-\!\underline{\mu_{\vec{z}}})^{\mathbf{H}}   \mathbf{R}^{\!\!-1}(\!\mathbf{\alpha^{-1}}\!\underline{\vec{x}}\!-\!\underline{\mu_{\vec{z}}}\!)\!+\!

So my questions are: How to complete the trace operation in $(1)$ in order to get inner product with a constant vector? How to perform integration in the last equation in order to get inner product with a gaussian vector?","Good day! I would like to find the distribution of the inner product of a random complex normal vector with: some constant vector; random gaussian vector. Let's assume a vector $\vec{z}$ which has a complex normal distribution with location parameter $\mu$, covariance matrix $\mathbf{\Gamma}$ and the relation matrix $\mathbf{C}$: $$\vec{z}=\{\Re{\vec{z}},\Im{\vec{z}}\}^{T}=\{z_1,z_2\ldots z_n\}^{T}\sim \mathit{CN}(\mu_{\vec{z}}, \mathbf{\Gamma},\mathbf{C})$$ So the pdf of $\vec{z}$ is: $$w_{\vec{z}}(z_1,z_2\ldots z_n)= \frac{1}{\pi^k\sqrt{\det(\mathbf{\Gamma})\det(\mathbf{\Gamma}-\mathbf{C^{H}}\mathbf{\Gamma^{-1}}\mathbf{C})}}\times\\ \times \exp\!\left[\!-\frac12 \begin{pmatrix} (\vec{z}-\mu_{\vec{z}})^{\ast}\!\!\!&\!\!\!(\vec{z}-\mu_{\vec{z}})\end{pmatrix}     \begin{pmatrix}\mathbf{\Gamma}&\mathbf{C}\\\mathbf{C^{H}}&\mathbf{\Gamma}^{\ast}\end{pmatrix}^{\!\!-1}\! \!\!                                 \begin{pmatrix} \vec{z}-\mu_{\vec{z}} \\ \vec{z}^{\ast}-\mu_{\vec{z}}^{\ast}\end{pmatrix} \right] $$ and a complex constant vector $\vec{a}=\{\Re{\vec{a}},\Im{\vec{a}}\}^{T}=\{a_1,a_2\ldots a_n\}^{T}$. I'd like to find the joint distribution of $(\Re{U},\Im{U})$ where $U=\vec{z}.\vec{a}^{\mathbf{H}}$ My attempt. First I can form a matrix $\mathbf{A}=\text{diag}\{\vec{a}^{\mathbf{H}}\}$ and using the property that $$Z\ \sim\ \mathit{CN}(\mu,\,\mathbf{\Gamma},\, \mathbf{C}) \quad\Rightarrow\quad AZ+b\ \sim\ \mathit{CN}(A\mu+b,\, A\mathbf{\Gamma} A^{\mathbf{H}},\, A\mathbf{C}A^{\mathbf{T}}) $$ and rearranging $U=\vec{z}.\vec{a}^{\mathbf{H}}$ as $U=\mathrm{tr}\left(\mathbf{A}\vec{z}\right)$ I can say that $\mathbf{A}\vec{z}\sim \mathit{CN}(\mathbf{A}\mu_{\vec{z}},\, \mathbf{A}\mathbf{\Gamma} \mathbf{A}^{\mathbf{H}},\, \mathbf{A}\mathbf{C}\mathbf{A}^{\mathbf{T}})$. Then I tried to rewrite covariance matrix of $\mathbf{A}\vec{z}$ as: $$    \begin{pmatrix}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{\Gamma} \mathbf{A}^{\mathbf{H}}&\mathbf{A}\mathbf{C}\mathbf{A}^{\mathbf{T}}\\(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{C}\mathbf{A}^{\mathbf{T}})^{\mathbf{H}}&(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{\Gamma} \mathbf{A}^{\mathbf{H}})^{\ast}\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf{A}&\mathbf{0}\\\mathbf{0}&\mathbf{A}^{\ast}\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf{\Gamma}&\mathbf{C}\\\mathbf{C^{H}}&\mathbf{\Gamma}^{\ast}\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf{A}^{\ast}&\mathbf{0}\\\mathbf{0}&\mathbf{A}\end{pmatrix} $$ And since $\mathbf{A}$ is diagonal $$\det{\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{\Gamma} \mathbf{A}^{\mathbf{H}}&\mathbf{A}\mathbf{C}\mathbf{A}^{\mathbf{T}}\\(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{C}\mathbf{A}^{\mathbf{T}})^{\mathbf{H}}&(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{\Gamma} \mathbf{A}^{\mathbf{H}})^{\ast}\end{pmatrix}}=\det{\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf{\Gamma}&\mathbf{C}\\\mathbf{C^{H}}&\mathbf{\Gamma}^{\ast}\end{pmatrix}}\prod^n_{i=1}|a_i|^4$$ So the pdf of $\mathbf{A}\vec{z}$ would look like: $$ w_{\mathbf{A}\vec{z}}(x_1,x_2\ldots x_n)= \frac{1}{\pi^k\sqrt{\det{\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf{\Gamma}&\mathbf{C}\\\mathbf{C^{H}}&\mathbf{\Gamma}^{\ast}\end{pmatrix}}}\prod^n_{i=1}|a_i|^2 }\times\\ \!\!\times \!\!\exp\!\left[\!-\frac12 \begin{pmatrix} (\vec{x}-\mathbf{A}\mu_{\vec{z}})^{\ast}\!\!\!&\!\!\!(\vec{x}-\mathbf{A}\mu_{\vec{z}}\! )\end{pmatrix}    \!\!\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf{A^{-1}}&\mathbf{0}\\\mathbf{0}&\mathbf{A^{-1}}^{\ast}\end{pmatrix}\! \!\!\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf{\Gamma}&\mathbf{C}\\\mathbf{C^{H}}&\mathbf{\Gamma}^{\ast}\end{pmatrix}^{\!\!-1}\! \!\!\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf{A^{-1}}^{\ast}&\mathbf{0}\\\mathbf{0}&\mathbf{A^{-1}}\end{pmatrix}\! \!\!                                 \begin{pmatrix} \vec{x}-\mathbf{A}\mu_{\vec{z}} \\ \vec{x}^{\ast}-\mathbf{A}^{\ast}\mu_{\vec{z}}^{\ast}\end{pmatrix}\! \!\! \right]  $$ UPDATE Using the notation of augmented matrices and vectors I can put it in a different form. Let's call $$\mathbf{\alpha}=\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf{A}^{\ast}&\mathbf{0}\\\mathbf{0}&\mathbf{A}\end{pmatrix}, \ \mathbf{\alpha^{-1}}=\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf{A^{-1}}^{\ast}&\mathbf{0}\\\mathbf{0}&\mathbf{A^{-1}}\end{pmatrix}, \ \mathbf{R}=\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf{\Gamma}&\mathbf{C}\\\mathbf{C^{H}}&\mathbf{\Gamma}^{\ast}\end{pmatrix}, \ \underline{\vec{x}}=\begin{pmatrix} \vec{x}\\ \vec{x}^{\ast}\end{pmatrix}$$ Then the pdf can be rewritten as $$ w_{\mathbf{A}\vec{z}}(x_1,x_2\ldots x_n)= \frac{1}{\pi^{k}\prod^n_{i=1}|a_i|^{2}\sqrt{\det{\mathbf{R}}}}\exp\!\left[\!-\frac12  (\underline{\vec{x}}-\mathbf{\alpha}\underline{\mu_{\vec{z}}})^{\mathbf{H}}    \mathbf{\alpha^{-H}} \mathbf{R}^{\!\!-1}\mathbf{\alpha^{-1}} (\underline{\vec{x}}-\mathbf{\alpha}\underline{\mu_{\vec{z}}}) \right]  $$ then multiplying matrices inside the exponent I get $$ w_{\mathbf{A}\vec{z}}(x_1,x_2\ldots x_n)= \frac{1}{\pi^{k}\prod^n_{i=1}|a_i|^{2}\sqrt{\det{\mathbf{R}}}}\exp\!\left[\!-\frac12  (\mathbf{\alpha^{-1}}\underline{\vec{x}}-\underline{\mu_{\vec{z}}})^{\mathbf{H}}   \mathbf{R}^{\!\!-1}(\mathbf{\alpha^{-1}}\underline{\vec{x}}-\underline{\mu_{\vec{z}}}) \right] \!\!\!\tag{1} $$ But next I should find the distribution of the  sum of elements of $\mathbf{A}\vec{z}$ and here I'm stuck. In the second case one can set $\vec{a}$ to be gaussian with augmented mean vector $\underline{\mu_{\vec{a}}}$ and augmented covariance matrix $\mathbf{R_a}$ and pdf $$w_{\vec{a}}(a_1,a_2\ldots a_n)= \frac{1}{\pi^{k}\sqrt{\det{\mathbf{R_a}}}}\exp\!\left[\!-\frac12  (\underline{\vec{a}}-\underline{\mu_{\vec{a}}})^{\mathbf{H}}   \mathbf{R_a}^{\!\!-1}(\underline{\vec{a}}-\underline{\mu_{\vec{a}}}) \right] $$ Then one can treat $(1)$ as the conditional distribution of $\mathbf{A}\vec{z}$ given $\vec{a}$, so the unconditional distibution would be  $$ w_{\mathbf{A}\vec{z}}(x_1,x_2\ldots x_n)=\int w_{\mathbf{A}\vec{z}|\vec{a}}(x_1,x_2\ldots x_n|\vec{a})w_{\vec{a}}(a_1,a_2\ldots a_n)\mathrm{d \vec{a}}$$ Which (up to the scale factor) will look like $$ w_{\mathbf{A}\vec{z}}(x_1,x_2\ldots x_n)\!\!\propto \!\!\int \! \!\frac{1}{\prod^n_{i=1}|a_i|^{2}}  \!\exp\!\left[\!-\!\frac{(\mathbf{\alpha^{-1}}\underline{\vec{x}}\!-\!\underline{\mu_{\vec{z}}})^{\mathbf{H}}   \mathbf{R}^{\!\!-1}(\!\mathbf{\alpha^{-1}}\!\underline{\vec{x}}\!-\!\underline{\mu_{\vec{z}}}\!)\!+\! (\!\underline{\vec{a}}\!-\!\underline{\mu_{\vec{a}}})^{\mathbf{H}}   \mathbf{R_a}^{\!\!-1}(\!\underline{\vec{a}}\!-\!\underline{\mu_{\vec{a}}}\!)}{2} \right]\! \mathrm{d \!\vec{a}}  $$ It is not clear to me how to cope with this integral (especially since \vec{a} is complex then it should be treated as some contour integral or not?) So my questions are: How to complete the trace operation in $(1)$ in order to get inner product with a constant vector?

I have broken the region bounded by the trig functions into 5 subregions in order to avoid integrating across an interval that splits any particular definition for the inverse functions. I know some symmetry could help simplify the calculations but does not help with my misunderstanding: 1) $\arccos(y)\leq x\leq\arcsin(y)\qquad -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\leq y \leq \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\qquad$ $y$ is decreasing 2) $\arcsin(y)\leq x\leq \frac{\pi}{2} \qquad \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\leq y\leq 1\qquad$ $y$ is increasing 3) $\frac{\pi}{2}\leq x\leq\arcsin(y) \qquad \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\leq y \leq 1\qquad$ $y$ is decreasing 4) $\arccos(y)\leq x\leq \pi \qquad -1\leq y\leq-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\qquad$ $y$ is decreasing 5) $\pi\leq x\leq\arccos(y)\qquad -1\leq y\leq-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\qquad$ $y$ is increasing Working through this problem I have tried to reason by looking at increasing or decreasing $y$ in terms of increasing $x$. This seems to work in all regions but 4) and 5). There is a sign change that I cannot account for. So I have the following corresponding integrals for the $dxdy$ integration order: 1) $ \int_{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}^{\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}}\int_{\arccos(y)}^{\arcsin(y)}dxdy = \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{2}}$ 2) $ \int_{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}^{1}\int_{\arcsin(y)}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}dxdy = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}-\frac{\pi}{4\sqrt{2}}$ 3) $ \int_{1}^{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}\int_{\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\arcsin(y)}dxdy = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}-\frac{\pi}{4\sqrt{2}}$ 4) $ \int_{\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}}^{-1}\int_{\arccos(y)}^{\pi}dxdy = -\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}-\frac{\pi}{4\sqrt{2}}\right)$ 5) $ \int_{-1}^{\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}}\int_{\pi}^{\arccos(y)}dxdy = -\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}-\frac{\pi}{4\sqrt{2}}\right)$ Integrals 4 and 5 evaluate to minus their respective areas. I'm a bit confused as to the reasoning. I think i finally got this one. The bounded region under consideration crosses over the domain of definition for both the $\arcsin(y)$ and $\arccos(y)$. The standard domain of definition for these functions is: $-\frac{\pi}{2}\leq arcsin(y)\leq\frac{\pi}{2}\qquad0\leq\arccos(y)\leq\pi$ The way I finally realized what was happening here was by investigating the graph of the inverse functions on their standard domains and asking myself the following question: How can I continuously extend the graph of these inverses to include the bounded region? From this, one sees that multiplying the $\arcsin(y)$ by -1 and adding $\pi$ provides a continuous extension that covers the bounded region. Likewise for $\arccos(y)$ multiply by -1 and add $2\pi$.

I have broken the region bounded by the trig functions into 5 subregions in order to avoid integrating across an interval that splits any particular definition for the inverse functions. I know some symmetry could help simplify the calculations but does not help with my misunderstanding: 1) $\arccos(y)\leq x\leq\arcsin(y)\qquad -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\leq y \leq \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\qquad$ $y$ is decreasing 2) $\arcsin(y)\leq x\leq \frac{\pi}{2} \qquad \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\leq y\leq 1\qquad$ $y$ is increasing 3) $\frac{\pi}{2}\leq x\leq\arcsin(y) \qquad \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\leq y \leq 1\qquad$ $y$ is decreasing 4) $\arccos(y)\leq x\leq \pi \qquad -1\leq y\leq-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\qquad$ $y$ is decreasing 5) $\pi\leq x\leq\arccos(y)\qquad -1\leq y\leq-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\qquad$ $y$ is increasing Working through this problem I have tried to reason by looking at increasing or decreasing $y$ in terms of increasing $x$. This seems to work in all regions but 4) and 5). There is a sign change that I cannot account for. So I have the following corresponding integrals for the $dxdy$ integration order: 1) $ \int_{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}^{\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}}\int_{\arccos(y)}^{\arcsin(y)}dxdy = \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{2}}$ 2) $ \int_{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}^{1}\int_{\arcsin(y)}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}dxdy = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}-\frac{\pi}{4\sqrt{2}}$ 3) $ \int_{1}^{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}\int_{\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\arcsin(y)}dxdy = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}-\frac{\pi}{4\sqrt{2}}$ 4) $ \int_{\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}}^{-1}\int_{\arccos(y)}^{\pi}dxdy = -\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}-\frac{\pi}{4\sqrt{2}}\right)$ 5) $ \int_{-1}^{\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}}\int_{\pi}^{\arccos(y)}dxdy = -\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}-\frac{\pi}{4\sqrt{2}}\right)$ Integrals 4 and 5 evaluate to minus their respective areas. I'm a bit confused as to the reasoning. I think i finally got this one. The bounded region under consideration crosses over the domain of definition for both the $\arcsin(y)$ and $\arccos(y)$. The standard domain of definition for these functions is: $-\frac{\pi}{2}\leq arcsin(y)\leq\frac{\pi}{2}\qquad0\leq\arccos(y)\leq\pi$ The way I finally realized what was happening here was by investigating the graph of the inverse functions on their standard domains and asking myself the following question: How can I continuously extend the graph of these inverses to include the bounded region?

29,Can the sign of a continuous function be 'made Riemann integrable'?,Can the sign of a continuous function be 'made Riemann integrable'?,,"Question: I would like to know whether the following statement is true: For every continuous function $f:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}$ there is a Riemann-integrable function $g:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}$ with values in $[-1,1]$ such that $\int f\cdot g=\int |f|$. Motivation: I am trying to prove that the canonical bounded linear injection $X\to X^{**}$ of a normed space into its double (continuous) dual is isometric, for the specific case of $X=C[0,1]$ in the $L^1$-norm, without using Hahn-Banach , and without using the Lebesgue integral . So I want to constructively cook up for each continuous $f$ a functional $\alpha$ on $C[0,1]$ of norm 1 which maps $f$ to its norm. From Lebesgue integration we know: the dense inclusion $C[0,1]\to L^1[0,1]$ yields an isomorphism $L^\infty[0,1]\cong(L^1[0,1])^*\to (C[0,1])^*$, so every functional (of unit norm) on $C[0,1]$ must be given by integration against an essentially bounded function (with essential supremum equal to 1). I am hoping to get such a function which is Riemann integrable. Some thoughts: A naive guess is to take $g_0=|f|/f$, i.e. the 'sign' of $f$, and set it to be $0$ (say) on points where $f$ is zero. Then $g_0=1_{\{f>0\}}+0\cdot 1_{\{f=0\}}-1_{\{f<0\}}$. This $g_0$ is measurable (the sets $\{f>0\},\{f<0\}$ are open as $f$ is continuous) with essential supremum equal to 1. But I am afraid this (for suitable $f$) is NOT Riemann integrable for the following reason. Riemann integrability of this bounded function is equivalent to being continuous outside a set of measure zero. If I am not mistaking, the discontinuity set of $g_0$ is precisely $\partial\{f=0\}$, the boundary of the zero set of $f$. Since every closed set of $[0,1]$ is the zero-set of a continuous function (e.g. the 'distance to that set'), it suffices to construct a closed set of nonzero measure consisting solely of boundary points. For example the closure of a nowhere dense set (i.e. a closed with empty interior) of positive measure will do. The (closure of the) fat Cantor set is an example of such a set. My problem is that this $f$ (the distance function) does not take both positive and negative values, and I could imagine that an adjustment of the behaviour of $g_0$ at $\{f=0\}$ could 'compensate' for this.","Question: I would like to know whether the following statement is true: For every continuous function $f:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}$ there is a Riemann-integrable function $g:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}$ with values in $[-1,1]$ such that $\int f\cdot g=\int |f|$.
