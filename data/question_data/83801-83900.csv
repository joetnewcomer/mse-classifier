1,Lifting spectral gap to covering space,Lifting spectral gap to covering space,,"Let $M$ a complete Riemannian manifold. It is well known that the Laplace-Beltrami operator on $M$ is essentially self-adjoint and thus has a unique self-adjoint extension  $\Delta_M$ in $L^2(M)$. The spectrum $\sigma(\Delta_M)$ is contained in $[0,\infty)$ and we denote $$ \lambda(M):=\inf\{\mu\in\sigma(\Delta_M)\vert \mu\neq 0\}. $$ If $M$ is closed, then $\lambda(M)$ is positive and coincides with the smallest nonzero eigenvalue. However $\lambda(M)$ may very well be $0$, as it is the case for $M=\mathbb{R}^n$. (Non-compact examples with $\lambda(M)>0$ are provided by simply connected spaces with negative sectional curvatures bounded away from $0$ - this was shown by McKean .) Question: Suppose $N$ is a complete Riemannian manifold with $\lambda(N)>0$ and $p\colon \hat N \rightarrow N$ is a finite sheeted Riemannian covering. Do we have $\lambda(\hat N)>0$? 1) EQUIVALENT PROBLEM This is related to this question of mine. (Note that $\lambda(M)>0$ if and only if the (unique) closed extension of the exterior derivative $d$ in $L^2$ has closed range.) 2) TRANSFER HOMOMORPHISM AND CALCULATION ON CIRCLES Here are some ideas and an example calculation: (Let $n$ the number of sheets of $p$). First, define the transfer homomorphism $T\colon L^2\hat N \rightarrow L^2N$ as follows: If $v\in L^2\hat N$ and $U\subset N$ is an evenly covered open set, then $Tv:=1/n \cdot \sum_{j=1}^n s_j^*v$, where $(s_j\colon U\rightarrow \hat N)_j$ are the $n$ distinct local sections of $p$. Then $Tp^*= I \in \mathcal{B}(L^2N)$ $p^*T=:Q\in \mathcal{B}(L^2\hat N)$ is the orthogonal projection onto the subspace of functions which are invariant under the action of deck transformations. $T\hat \Delta v=\Delta T v$ for $v\in C^\infty\hat N\cap L^2\hat N$. Naive Strategy: Let's just look at eigenvalues and let's try to prove that $\sigma_p(\hat \Delta) \subset \sigma_p(\Delta)$. Problem: If $\hat\Delta v = \lambda v$, then $\Delta Tv = \lambda Tv$, but $Tv$ might be $0$. Example: Let $S^1_L:=\mathbb{R}/{L\mathbb{Z}}$ the circle of length $L$. Then $u_k(t) = \exp(2\pi itk/L )$ defines a smooth function on $S_L^1$ and satisfies $-u_k''=(2\pi k/L)^2 u_k$. All eigenfunctions of $\Delta_{S^1_L}$ are of this form and thus $\sigma(\Delta_{S^1_L})=\{(2\pi k/L)^2\vert ~k\in \mathbb{Z}\}$ and $\lambda(S^1_L)=(2\pi/L)^2$. Now consider $p\colon S^1_{nL} \rightarrow S^1_{L},t + nL\mathbb{Z} \mapsto t + L\mathbb{Z} $. We first see that $\lambda(S^1_{nL})=n^{-2}\lambda(S^1_L)$, hence $\sigma_p(\hat \Delta) \subset \sigma_p(\Delta)$ cannot be true. What happens? The transfer homomorphism is of the form $ Tv(t) =1/n\cdot \sum_{j=1}^{n} v(t+jL). $ Let $v_k(t) = \exp(2\pi itk/(nL) )$ the eigenfunctions on $S^1_{nL}$. Then $$ Tv_k =v_k \cdot 1/n \cdot \sum_{j=1}^n  \exp(2\pi ijk/n )=\begin{cases} 0 & k \nmid n \\ v_k & k \mid n \end{cases}, $$ hence the first few eigenfunctions indeed lie in the kernel of $T$. 3) ABSTRACT APPROACH Here is another thought: Maybe we can forget about the covering space setting and just focus on the action of $G=\mathrm{Aut}(p)$ on $H=L^2\hat N$. Take this as new setting: Let $G$ a finite group that acts on a Hilbert space $H$ by isometries and suppose that $A$ is a self-adjoint operator in $H$ such that If $x\in D(A)$, then for all $g\in G$ $gx\in D(A)$ and $Agx=gAx$. Let $H^G$ the subspace of $G$-invariant elements and $A^G$ with domain $D(A^G)=D(A)\cap H^G$ the restriction of $A$ to $H^G$. This is then a self-adjoint operator in $H^G$ and the question is: Can we determine $\sigma(A)$ from $\sigma(A^G)$? Unfortunately the answer to this question is no: Example: Let $H = \mathbb{C}^2$, $G=\{I,\begin{bmatrix}0&1 \\ 1&0 \end{bmatrix} \}$.

6,When does analytic in the operator norm imply analytic in the trace class norm?,When does analytic in the operator norm imply analytic in the trace class norm?,,"Consider $U$ a nice compact region in $\mathbb{C}$ with boundary $\Gamma$. Let $S_1$ b the ideal of trace class operators on a separable complex Hilbert space $H$. We will let $\|\cdot \|$ be the operator norm and $\|\cdot \|_1$ be the trace norm. Suppose $W:U\to S_1$ is complex analytic in the operator norm. Under what conditions is $W(\lambda)$ analytic in the $\| \cdot \|_1$ norm? I have proved that the following are equivalent when $W(\lambda)$ is operator analytic: $W(\lambda)$ is continuous in the operator norm for a fixed $M$, we have $\|W(\lambda)\|_1 <M$ for each $\lambda \in \Gamma$ tr $W(\lambda)B$ is analytic for each bounded operator $B$. $W(\lambda)$ is analytic in the $\|\cdot\|_1$ norm. I can provide some ideas for these proofs if that's be helpful. This leads us to Question 1 : What if we know that tr $W(\lambda)$ is analytic? Is there a nice way to compare tr $W(\lambda)$ with tr $W(\lambda)B$? I would love an inequality like  $$ |\text{tr }AB| \leq\|B\||\text{tr }A|  $$ for $A \in S_1$ and $B$ bounded. Although it would probably be greedy to expect this in general. Also, I'm willing to impose even stronger assumptions on $W$ if necessary. One very strong constraint is to assume that $W$ has a rank bound along $\Gamma$, I.E. for a fixed $N$ we have rank $W(\lambda)<N$ for each $\lambda \in \Gamma$. This actually guarantees analyticity as  $$\|W(\lambda)\|_1 \leq N\sup_{\lambda \in \Gamma} \|W(\lambda)\|$$ Attempting to weaken this condition, we arrive at Question 2 : What happens if $W(\lambda)$ is finite rank for each $\lambda$, but has no rank bound?

Suppose they converge pointwise to an analytic function $f$. Then $f$ is analytic on an open dense neighborhood of $U$. This is potentially helpful because for any orthonormal basis $\phi_i$, $$ \text{tr} W(\lambda) B = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \langle W(\lambda)B\phi_i,\phi_i\rangle $$ And because $W(\lambda)B$ is analytic in the operator norm, so will the each inner product be analytic.

Unfortunately, despite all of the great theorems on bounds for singular values, knowing that tr $W(\lambda)$ is analytic gives no information about the singular values.","Consider $U$ a nice compact region in $\mathbb{C}$ with boundary $\Gamma$. Let $S_1$ b the ideal of trace class operators on a separable complex Hilbert space $H$. We will let $\|\cdot \|$ be the operator norm and $\|\cdot \|_1$ be the trace norm. Suppose $W:U\to S_1$ is complex analytic in the operator norm. Under what conditions is $W(\lambda)$ analytic in the $\| \cdot \|_1$ norm? I have proved that the following are equivalent when $W(\lambda)$ is operator analytic: $W(\lambda)$ is continuous in the operator norm for a fixed $M$, we have $\|W(\lambda)\|_1 <M$ for each $\lambda \in \Gamma$ tr $W(\lambda)B$ is analytic for each bounded operator $B$. $W(\lambda)$ is analytic in the $\|\cdot\|_1$ norm. I can provide some ideas for these proofs if that's be helpful. This leads us to Question 1 : What if we know that tr $W(\lambda)$ is analytic? Is there a nice way to compare tr $W(\lambda)$ with tr $W(\lambda)B$? I would love an inequality like  $$ |\text{tr }AB| \leq\|B\||\text{tr }A|  $$ for $A \in S_1$ and $B$ bounded.

On page 299 Theorem 1 (in the second edition), he proves that for $f \in H^{-1}(U)$, $$\begin{multline}\|f\|_{H^{-1}(U)} = \inf \Big\{ \left( \int_U \sum_{i=0}^n |f^i|^2 dx \right): \langle f, v \rangle = \int_U f^0 v + \sum_{i=1}^n f^i v_{x_i} dx,\\ \;f^0,\ldots,f^n \in L^2(U), \; \forall v \in H^1(U)\Big\}. \end{multline}$$ Here $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$ denotes the dual pairing of $H^{-1}$ and $H_0^1$. To show this, he first states that given $f \in H^{-1}(U)$, we can apply to the Riesz Representation Theorem to get an element $u \in H_0^1$ such that $(u,v)_{H_0^1} = \langle f,v \rangle \; \forall v \in H_0^1$, where $(u,v)_{H_0^1} = \int Du \cdot Dv + uv dx$ is an inner product on $H_0^1$.

96,"""Moral"" difference between Poincare and Sobolev inequalities","""Moral"" difference between Poincare and Sobolev inequalities",,"I wonder what are the ""moral"" differences between Poincare and Sobolev inequalities. Let me state them (hopefully without errors) using Wikipedia as source: Poincare inequalities Let $\Omega$ be a domain in $\mathbb R^n$ bounded in at least one direction, then there exists some $C = C(p, \Omega)$ such that for all $u \in W^{1,p}_0(\Omega)$ ( $1\leq p < \infty$ ) $$ \Vert u \Vert_{L^p(\Omega)} \leq C \Vert \nabla u \Vert_{L^p(\Omega)} $$ We can also change the condition of $u$ belonging in $W^{1,p}_0(\Omega)$ by $u \in W^{1,p}(\Omega)$ and $\int_\Omega u dx = 0$ (only for bounded $\Omega$ ). This is called Poincare-Wirtinger. Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev inequality Assume $u \in W^{1,p}(\mathbb R^n)$ (in Wikipedia they say $u\in C^1(\mathbb R^n)$ with compact support but by density I think it doesn't matter, correct me if I'm wrong please). Then for $p \in [1,n)$ , there exists some $C=C(p)>0$ such that $$ \Vert u \Vert_{p^*} \leq C \Vert \nabla u \Vert_{p} $$ where $p^*$ is some real number larger than $p$ and depending on $n$ and $p$ . I can see that Poincare inequalities are intimately related to domains, whereas GNS isn't. But at first glance, GNS is stronger because if we assume $\Omega$ bounded then $u \in W^{1,p}_0(\Omega) \subset W^{1,p}(\mathbb R^n)$ (by extending $u$ by $0$ outside of $\Omega$ ) and moreover $\Vert \nabla u \Vert_p \lesssim \Vert \nabla u \Vert_{p^*}$ by Holder ineq. Summing up, it seems to me that in GNS we don't ask any condition on $u$ besides being in $W^{1,p}$ and we get an (intuitively) better bound on its $p$ -norm because it ""uses"" lower integrability on $\nabla u$ . A related very vague question, whenever I am working in a domain, when should I be thinking about Poincare inequality and when about GNS inequality?","I wonder what are the ""moral"" differences between Poincare and Sobolev inequalities.

98,Problem in proof of open mapping theorem?,Problem in proof of open mapping theorem?,,"I was doing proof of open mapping theorem from the book Walter Rudin real and complex analysis book and struck at one point. Given if $X$ and $Y$ are Banach spaces and $T$ is a bounded linear operator between them which is $\textbf{onto}$. Then to prove $$T(U) \supset \delta V$$ where $U$ is open unit ball in $X$ and $\delta V = \{ y \in Y : \|y\| < \delta\}$. Proof- For any $y \in Y$ since map is onto, there exist an $x \in X$ such that $Tx = y$. It is also clear that if $\|x\| < k$, then $y \in T(kU)$ for any $k$. Clearly $$Y = \underset{k \in \mathbb{N}}{\cup}  T(kU) $$ But as $Y$ is complete, by Baire category theorem it can't be written as countable union of nowhere dense sets. So there exist atleast one $k$ such that $ T(kU)$ is not nowhere dense.  Thus this means $$(\overline{T(kU)})^0 \ne \emptyset$$ i.e. $ T(kU)$ closure has non empty interior. Let $W$ be open set contained in closure of  $T(kU)$. Now for any $w \in W \implies w \in \overline{T(kU})$, so every point of $W$ is the limit of the sequence $\{Tx_i\}$, where $x_i \in kU$, Let us now fix $W$ and $k$. Now choose $y_0 \in W$ and choose $\eta > 0$, so that $y_0+y \in W$ if $\|y\| < \eta$. This can be done as $W$ is open set, so every point of it has some neighborhood also there. Now as $y_0 , y_0+y \in W$ from above paragraph  there exist sequences $\{x_i'\}$ and $\{x_i''\}$ in $kU$ such that $$T(x_i') \to y_0 \qquad T(x_i'') \to y_0+y \quad as \ i \to \infty$$ Set $x_i = x_i'-x_i''$. Then clearly $$\|x_i\| \leq \|x_i'\| + \|x_i''\| < 2k$$ and $T(x_i) \to y$. Since this holds for every $y$ with $\|y\|< \eta$. Now it is written that, the linearity of $T$ shows that following is true for $\delta = \dfrac{\eta}{2k}$ To each $y \in Y$ and to each $\epsilon > 0$ there corresponds an $x \in X$ such that $$\|x\| \leq \delta^{-1}\|y\| \quad \text{and} \quad \|Tx-y\| < \epsilon \quad (1)$$ How does this follows?
