24,Distributional divergence of $\frac{x}{\|x\|}$.,Distributional divergence of .,\frac{x}{\|x\|},"I have the vector field \begin{align*} X:\mathbb R^d&\to\mathbb R^d\\ x&\mapsto\frac{x}{\|x\|} \end{align*} which is a differentiable vector field outside of the origin, and I am interested in its divergence. After some easy computation we get $$ \mathrm{div}(X)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll} 2\delta_0&d=1\\ \frac{d-1}{\|x\|}&d\geq 2. \end{array}\right. $$ The problem with the above computation is that the dimension 1 case is computed as a distributional derivative and the case of bigger dimension is computed classically. This is a problem because for the longest time I thought that $$ \mathrm{div}(X) $$ should have a Dirac delta in the origin in any dimension, and I still believe it has to have it. The reasons I do believe it has a Dirac delta component in the origin is because for $X$ infinite integral curves start from the origin. To put it differently, if we were to look at $-X$ , if one were to search for the solutions to the continuity equation for $-X$ , i.e. $$ \partial \mu_t+\mathrm{div}((-X)\mu_t)=0 $$ one would see how mass accumulates at the origin. Question 1): did I make a mistake in my computations and $\mathrm{div}(X)$ has a Dirac delta in the origin? Or more correctly, if my computation isn't wrong classically but is wrong distributionally, how would I carry out that computation? Because it still doesn't yield a singular part when I evaluate with polar coordinates. Question 2): is my intuition wrong and in reality in dimension bigger than one there is never a Dirac delta in that computation even distributionally? Any help or literature is appreciated. Maybe it is all because my differential geometry skills are very rusty.","I have the vector field which is a differentiable vector field outside of the origin, and I am interested in its divergence.

And how do I know it's correct as an autodidact without teacher?,,"TLDR: Are there different solutions to orthogonal trajectories, and if so, how can I as an autodidact check whether I'm doing things correctly or not? The reason I'm asking this is because the textbook and the solution of someone with a PhD in Mathematics have different answers (or at least, someone claiming to have it). I'll show both and then my approach. Problem: find the orthogonal trajectory of $r = c(1 + \cos(θ))$ Textbook solution without work: $r = c(1 - \cos(θ))$ PhD Mathematics solution: $$(1)\ \frac{dr}{dθ} = -c\sin(θ)$$ $$(2)\ \frac{1}{r}\frac{dr}{dθ} = -\frac{c}{r}\sin(θ)$$ $$(3)\ \frac{1}{r}\frac{dr}{dθ} = \frac{r}{c\sin(θ)}$$ $$(4)\ \frac{dr}{r^2} = \frac{1}{c}\csc(θ)dθ$$ Solve r by seperating variables $$(5)\ \frac{dr}{r^2} = \frac{1}{c}\csc(θ)dθ$$ After integrating both sides $$(6)\ -\frac{1}{r} = -\frac{1}{c}ln|\csc(θ) + \cot(θ)|- C$$ $$(7)\ r = -\frac{1}{\frac{1}{c}ln|\csc(θ) + \cot(θ)| + C}$$ Which is a different answer.

Now let's get to what interests here. I had some contact with the idea of a tangent space $T_pM$ on a point over one n-dim manifold $M$ , I also saw that in terms of a set of local coordinates $x^i$ , we represent an element ${\bf v}\in T_pM$ as $\sum_{i=1}^{n}v_i\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}$ , meaning that each symbol $\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i} \hspace{0,2cm} (i=1,2,\ldots, n)$ would represent something similar to those L.I. canonical vectors $e^1 = (1,0,\ldots,0), \ldots, e^n = (0, \ldots, 0, 1)$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ . In this last context, we'd say that an inner product between two vectors $v = (\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\alpha_i e^{i}$ and $w = (\beta_1,\ldots,\beta_n) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\beta_i e^{i}$ is numericaly correspondent to $\sum_{i=1}^{n}\alpha_i\beta_i$ , not difficult to verify if we consider $\langle e^i, e^j\rangle = \delta_{ij}$ . Now, by transposing this same ideia to a space where the vectors are represented as ${\bf v}$ above, could I say that $\nabla = \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{1}},\ldots,\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{n}}\right)$ is analogous to something like $(1,\ldots, 1)$ ? I just suspect I can't exactly consider it, the reason is that this wondering came up after one specific paragraph of a paper which says (given a first order polynomial differential system): ""[...] where $\mathcal{X}$ is the vector field associated to the system (1), i.e. $$\mathcal{X} = P_1(x)\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1} + \ldots + P_n(x)\frac{\partial}{\partial x_n}.$$ As usually the divergence of the vector field is defined by $$\textrm{div}\mathcal{X} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\partial P_i}{\partial x_i}.""$$ (From Liouvillian Integrability versus Darboux Polynomials - J.
