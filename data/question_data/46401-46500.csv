2,Help understanding proof involving Schur's Lemma.,Help understanding proof involving Schur's Lemma.,,"In the book Representation Theory, A First Course by William Fulton and Joe Harris, they state the following: Proposition 1.8 For any representation $V$ of a finite group $G$ , there is a decomposition $$ V=V_1^{\oplus a_1}\oplus\cdots\oplus V_k^{\oplus a_k}, $$ where the $V_i$ are distinct irreducible representations. The decomposition of $V$ into a direct sum of the $k$ factors is unique, as are the $V_i$ that occur and their multiplicities $a_i$ . Proof. It follows from Schur's lemma that if W is another representation of G, with a decomposition $W=\oplus W_j^{\oplus b_j}$ , and $\phi:V\rightarrow W$ is a map of representations, then $\phi$ must map the factor $V_i^{\oplus a_i}$ into that factor $W_j^{\oplus b_j}$ for which $W_j\cong V_i$ ; when applied to the identity map of $V$ to $V$ , the stated uniqueness follows.

Let $F$ be the completely free algebra in the signature $(+, \times, f, \mathbb{Z}[w])$ where $+$ and $\times$ are binary functions, $f$ is a unary, and $\mathbb{Z}$ is a set of constants. Additionally, let the function $d : F \to \mathbb{N}$ be defined as follows: $d(\mathbb{Z})$ is 0 $d(f(x))$ is $1 + d(x)$ for all $x$ . $d(x+y)$ is the maximum of $d(x)$ and $d(y)$ for all $x$ and $y$ . $d(x\times y) = d(x+y)$ Next, I will build a set of equations, $\Delta$ . The intent of this construction is to make $f(x)$ be a left inverse but not a right inverse of $x$ for every $x$ . Let $\Sigma_0$ consist of the axioms of non-commutative rings, all variable-free true equations (i.e. of the form $t_1(\varnothing) = t_2(\varnothing)$ ) in $\mathbb{Z}$ , and the variable-free equation $f(0) = 0$ . Note that $\Delta_0$ is $f$ -free except for a single sentence. Let $\Delta_0$ be the equational deductive closure of $\Sigma_0$ . Note that $\Delta_0$ does not include the non-theorem $xy = yx$ because we can't conclude that it's true. We know that $xy = yx$ holds of all integers $\mathbb{Z}[w]$ , but can't conclude that only integers exist. Let $\Sigma_1$ be the union of $\Delta_0$ , sentences $f(x)x = 1$ for each $x$ such that $d(x) = 0$ and $x \neq 0$ is in $\Delta_0$ , and sentences $f(x)x = 0$ for each $x$ such that $d(x) = 0$ and $x = 0$ is in $\Delta_0$ .

Let $I$ be a left ideal of $A$ . Suppose $I$ is $\{0\}$ , then $I$ is closed under left multiplication by arbitrary elements of $A$ . Suppose $I$ is not $\{0\}$ . It follows that $I$ has a nonzero element $c$ . $f(c)$ is a left inverse of $c$ and thus left multiplication by $rf(c)$ will hit the arbitrarily chosen ring element $r$ since $f(c)c = 1$ and thus $(rf(c))c = r(f(c)c) = r1 = r$ . Thus, if $I$ is not $(0)$ , then it is $(1)$ .

Show that $\sum\limits_{g\in G}\mathfrak{X}(g) = 0$ unless $\mathfrak{X}$ is the principal representation. I know that there are many different proofs of this fact, but I wanted to prove this statement on my own, and I have not yet seen a proof similar to mine (although I may be wrong). But is this proof correct? Unfortunately, as it has already turned out, this proof doesn't work for an arbitrary field, but it is probably true for a field with characteristic $0$ !!! Proof: Let $\mathfrak{X}$ be the principal representation, then by definition $\forall g\in G\Rightarrow \mathfrak{X}(g) = 1_{F}$ . Then $$\sum\limits_{g\in G}\mathfrak{X}(g) = \sum\limits_{g\in G}1_{F} =|G|\cdot 1_{F}$$ Now let $\mathfrak{X}$ not be the principal representation. Let $T = \sum\limits_{g\in G}\mathfrak{X}(g)$ . Note that $\forall a \in G$ $$\mathfrak{X}(a)T = \mathfrak{X}(a)\sum\limits_{g\in G}\mathfrak{X}(g) = \sum\limits_{g\in G}\mathfrak{X}(ag) = T.$$ Then it follows that $T^2 = |G|\cdot T$ . Then the polynomial $x^2 -|G|x$ is annulling for $T$ . Then the Jordan form of $T$ (up to permutations of Jordan cells) can take the following forms: Either $|G|\cdot I$ ; or zero matrix; or a matrix with several units diagonally (not completely filling it), and the rest of all values are zero, and multiplied by $|G|$ . Note that only the zero matrix among all these types of matrices has a trace equal to zero! Let $\chi$ be the character associated with $\mathfrak{X}$ . Consider the following expression $$S = \sum\limits_{g\in G}\chi(g) = [\chi, 1_G] = 0.$$ The last equality holds because $\chi\in Irr(G)$ and $\chi \neq 1_G$ . Since $\chi(g) = tr(\mathfrak{X}(g))$ and $tr(A + B) = tr(A) + tr(B)$ for any matrices $A$ and $B$ , we get that $S = tr(T) = 0$ . But only the zero matrix among the possible candidates for the role of $T$ had a zero trace.

10,Some questions on polynomial $f(x)=x^4+x^2+4$ over $\mathbb{Q}$,Some questions on polynomial  over,f(x)=x^4+x^2+4 \mathbb{Q},"1-) Firstly, I have shown that $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$ . To show, I first use the theorem that says: $$\text{Suppose there exist } r \in \mathbb{Q} \text{ such that } f(r)=0.\text{ Then } r\in\mathbb{Z} \text{ and }r|a_{0} \text{, where } a_0 \text{ constant coefficient of the polynomial.}$$ $$f(1)\neq0,\;f(-1)\neq0,\;f(2)\neq0,\;f(-2)\neq0,\;f(4)\neq0,\;f(-4)\neq0$$ But, since $\deg(f(x))=4$ , we cannot say anything about roots. Clearly, we cannot use Eisenstein Criterion either. Now, we can check whether it has any non-linear factors. Fortunately, it has! $$x^4+x^2+4=(x^2+x\sqrt{3}+2)(x^2-x\sqrt{3}+2)$$ But, $\sqrt{3} \notin \mathbb{Q}$ .Therefore $x^4+x^2+4$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$ . Here is the question. Can I say $f(x)$ is irreducible after all these calculations? 2-) I defined $$f_{1}(x)=x^2+x\sqrt{3}+2, \;f_{2}(x)=x^2-x\sqrt{3}+2$$ We can say $f=f_{1}\cdot f_{2}$ is reducible over $\mathbb{Q(\sqrt{3})}$ since $\sqrt{3} \in \mathbb{Q(\sqrt{3})}$ . Even $f(x)$ is reducible over extension field $\mathbb{Q(\sqrt3)}$ , $f_{1}$ and $f_{2}$ are irreducible over $\mathbb{Q(\sqrt3)}$ For $f_{1}(x)=x^2+x\sqrt{3}+2$ we have $x_{1,2}=\dfrac{-\sqrt{3}\pm \sqrt{-5}}{2}$ and also for $x_{3,4}=\dfrac{\sqrt{3}\pm\sqrt{-5}}{2}$ . We know that neither $\sqrt{-5} \notin \mathbb{Q}$ nor $\sqrt{-5} \notin \mathbb{Q({\sqrt{3}})}$ . Therefore, we need some new splitting field and it is, clearly, $\mathbb{Q(\sqrt{3},\sqrt{-5})}$ . I think there is no problem. But I have to ask to be sure, Can I extend the field like I did to split the polynomial? 3-) There is extension $\mathbb{Q(\sqrt{3},\sqrt{-5})}$ over $\mathbb{Q(\sqrt{3})}$ . There is also extension $\mathbb{Q(\sqrt{3})}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ . For the field extension $\mathbb{Q(\sqrt{3},\sqrt{-5})}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ we have the structure such as: $$\mathbb{Q(\sqrt{3},\sqrt{-5})}=\lbrace r+s\sqrt{3}+t\sqrt{-5}+z\sqrt{-15}:r,s,t,z\in \mathbb{Q}\rbrace$$ So, for the basis, dimension or degree of minimal polynomial we have $4$ and this basis is $\lbrace1,\sqrt{3},\sqrt{-5},\sqrt{-15}\rbrace$ For, the minimal polynomial of $\mathbb{Q(\sqrt{3},\sqrt{-5})}$ over $\mathbb{Q(\sqrt{3})}$ we have $P_{\sqrt{-5}}(x)=x^2+5$ this polynomial is irreducible since $\sqrt{-5}\notin\mathbb{Q(\sqrt{3})}$ . For the minimal polynomial of $\mathbb{Q(\sqrt{3})}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ we have $P_{\sqrt{3}}(x)=x^2-3$ and it is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein Criterion. 4-) Clearly $\mathbb{Q(\sqrt{3},\sqrt{-5})}$ is splitting field of $x^4+x^2+2$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ and since it is finite extension, we can say it is a normal extension and it is also separable extension since all the roots of polynomial is simple roots.

12,Under what circumstances are the relative Kahler differentials a flat module?,Under what circumstances are the relative Kahler differentials a flat module?,,"First let us recall one construction of the relative Kahler differentials. Let $k$ be a ring and $R$ a $k$ -algebra. The relative Kahler differentials $\Omega_{R/k}$ are the $R$ -module satisfying the following universal property: For any $R$ -module $M$ and $k$ -linear derivation $\delta:R\to M$ (an $R$ -module homomorphism satisfying the Leibniz rule), there exists a universal derivation $d:R\to\Omega_{R/k}$ and a unique $R$ -module homomorphism $\varphi:\Omega_{R/k}\to M$ such that $\varphi\circ d=\delta$ . You can use this universal property, along with some direct constructions and short exact sequences, to compute specific examples. Explicitly, suppose $R=k[x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}]/(f_{1},\ldots,f_{s})$ is a $k$ -algebra of finite type.

41,Find all the intermediate fields of the splitting field of $x^4 - 2$ over $\mathbb{Q}$,Find all the intermediate fields of the splitting field of  over,x^4 - 2 \mathbb{Q},"Okay, so I mostly worked this out, and I even created lattice diagrams as shown below. But I have a specific question about finding intermediate fields, which I will ask shortly. Let $\alpha = \sqrt[4]{2}$ and $\omega = e^{\frac{\pi}{4}i} = i$ .  Then $L = \mathbb{Q}(\alpha, i)$ is the splitting field of $x^4 -2$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ . Also, the Galois group $\Gamma_\mathbb{Q}(x^4 - 2) = D_8$ acts on the roots $\alpha, \alpha i, -\alpha,$ and $-\alpha i$ , and is generated by rotation $\sigma$ and reflection $\tau$ , where $\sigma(i) = i, \sigma(\alpha) = \alpha i$ and $\tau(\alpha) = \alpha, \tau(i) = -i$ . To find the intermediate fields between $L$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ , find the subgroups of $D_8$ instead with the idea that finding subgroups is easier and better understood than finding intermediate fields. Then from the subgroups, use the Galois correspondence to get all the intermediate fields. There are 10 subgroups of $D_8$ which must correspond to 10 intermediate fields.  Well, I pieced together 8 obvious candidates for intermediate fields, and in the end, I had to look up the other 2 which were $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha(1 + i))$ and $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha(1 - i))$ . Those two seemed strange until I realized that $\sqrt{8\alpha^2 i} = \alpha(1 + i)$ . Finally, I was able to check fixed fields to verify the exact correspondence, and come up with the diagrams. Question: Is there a systematic approach to finding and connecting up the corresponding intermediate fields once all the subgroups are known? I'm guessing, in general and maybe in this example with $D_8$ , there isn't a good, canonical way to anticipate and construct the field extensions?  The structure of groups and subgroups, as stated earlier, is easier and better understood than the structure of field extensions. Maybe this makes sense because the groups are finite and have only one operation, and fields are often infinite and have two operations. and UPDATE: In this lecture , Richard Borcherds clearly describes how to obtain the two nonobvious intermediate fields from the subgroups. Specifically, add the roots $\alpha$ and $\alpha i$ to fix by reflection one way, and then add the roots $\alpha$ and $-\alpha i$ to fix by reflection the other way.","Okay, so I mostly worked this out, and I even created lattice diagrams as shown below.

Let $\rho$ be an irreducible representation of $G$ over $\mathbb{C}$ .

Keep in mind, though, that a similar ""re-encoding"" process can be performed for just about anything which is suitably algebra/structure-like: topological spaces, lattices, relational algebras, logics, even languages. Note: In this context $2\times F=\{0,1\}\times F=F\sqcup F=\cdots$ Let $\mathcal{F}=\langle F,+,\cdot\rangle$ be a field . Let $Cd(\mathcal{F})=\langle 2\times F,*\rangle$ , where $*:(2\times F)^2\to2\times F$ is defined as follows: $$x*y=\begin{cases}(0,x_2+y_2)&x_1=y_1=0\\(0,x_2\cdot y_2)&x_1\ne y_1\\(1,x_2\cdot y_2)&x_1=y_1=1\end{cases}$$ Observe that $Cd(\mathcal{F})$ satisfies the following axioms: Associativity: $$x_1=y_1=z_1\implies x*(y*z)=(x*y)*z$$ Commutativity: $$x*y=y*x$$ Distributivity: $$x_1=1\land y_1=z_1=0\implies x*(y*z)=(x*y)*(x*z)$$ Identity: $$x_1=i\implies x*e^i=e^i*x=x\quad:\quad i=1,2$$ Inverse: $$x_1=i\implies x*\overline{x}=\overline{x}*x=e^i\quad:\quad x\ne(1,0)$$ Clearly, $\mathcal{F}\ne Cd(\mathcal{F})$ , nor is $\mathcal{F}$ isomorphic to $Cd(\mathcal{F})$ ; $Cd(\mathcal{F})$ is not even a field! Yet $Cd(\mathcal{F})$ is similar to $\mathcal{F}$ in extremely obvious ways, to the extent that $\mathcal{F}$ and $Cd(\mathcal{F})$ are ""basically the same thing,"" or, at the very least, $\mathcal{F}$ and $Cd(\mathcal{F})$ ""encode"" the same thing. Of course, without clarification, any two things can be likened to one another, regardless of how disimilar they actually are. One could easily say that a group is ""basically the same"" as a Lie algebra and proceed to justify why this is the case - but such an arbitrary comparison is intuitively less reasonable than that made above.

63,Kernel of the following Substitution Homomorphism over $\mathbb{C}[x]$,Kernel of the following Substitution Homomorphism over,\mathbb{C}[x],"I'm hoping someone could review my proof for accuracy, thanks! There is another proof of this on stack exchange, but it uses quotient rings, which we haven't learned yet. Problem: Let $\phi: \mathbb{C}[x,y]$ -> $\mathbb{C}[t]$ , a the homomorphism that sends x -> $t + 1$ and $ y$ -> $t^3 - 1 $ . Determine the kernel $K$ of $\phi$ , and prove that every ideal of $\mathbb{C}[x,y]$ that contains $K$ can be generated by two elements. Proof: Note that $f = (x-1)^3 - 1 - y \in K$ . Suppose there is some $g \in K$ such that $f$ does not divide $g$ in $\mathbb{C}[x,y]$ . Then we have that $f$ is monic of degree $1$ when considered as a polynomial in the variable $y$ . Then we have $g = fq + r$ , where deg(r) $\lt$ 1 (with respect to the variable $y$ ). This implies that $r(x)$ is either a polynomial in $\mathbb{C}[x]$ that is non constant or is the $0$ polynomial. If it is nonconstant in $x$ then since r $\in$ K we must have that $x+1$ is a root of r. Part I think is wrong: But this implies that the polynomial $r$ has infinite roots, as $x$ is a variable that can range over all of $\mathbb{C}$ for example. Part I think may work better: Alternatively, plugging in x -> $x + 1$ will not send a non zero polynomial to zero as we are working in an integral domain and the substitution will maintain the degree of the polynomial as distributing $x+1$ will just produce extra terms of lower degree. Hence we have r(x) must be the zero polynomial and so f generates all of K and so K is principle and $K$ = $ ( (x-1)^3 - 1 - y )$ . Then Let $I$ be an ideal that contains K. If I = (1), then I contains K and is generated by 1 element. Suppose $I$ is a proper ideal then. New attempt: Then for any $g$ $\in$ $I$ we have $g = fq + r$ when dividing over $y$ . Then deg(r) $\lt$ $1$ and so it is either a constant or a polynomial over $x$ , call it $r(x)$ . Since $r(x)$ $\in$ $\mathbb{C}[x]$ then the set of all remainders is an ideal and is principle as it is polynomials in one variable over a field. Though I’m not sure if we can claim the set of remainders is an ideal. It is certainly a subset of $I$ , but I’m not sure if it is an ideal itself. ______________below this  is wrong__________ Then let $g$ $\in$ I and suppose $f$ does not divide $g$ . Then we can similarly divide $g$ by $f$ and conclude the remainder, $r(x)$ , must be degree 0 in the variable y which implies it may be of non zero degree of $x$ . Indeed it may be as considering $f$ as a function in the variable $x$ now we have that it is monic of degree 3. Then $g = fq + r$ is valid as an equation in the variable $y$ , and the variable $x$ . So we are dealing with the same $r(x)$ value as previously, and it must satisfy the additional constraint that the degree of $r(x)$ is less than $3$ . Hence any g $\notin$ K for g $\in$ I is of the form $g = fq + r$ , where $r(x)$ $\in$ $\mathbb{C}[x]$ . Then $r(x)$ $\in$ I also, as $I$ is closed under addition. Then the the lowest degree of $r$ is $0$ , $1$ or $2$ . $0$ implies $I$ is the whole ring. $1$ or $2$ implies we can generate $I$ with either $x$ or $x$$^2$ as $\mathbb{C}[x]$ is a ring with only ideals that are principle that are generated by lowest degree monic polynomials, and so $x$ or x $^2$ would suffice in that case. In any case we have I =  or , or <1>. Hence the claim is shown.","I'm hoping someone could review my proof for accuracy, thanks!

Prove that if the left free $R$ -modules, $R^n$ and $R^m$ are isomorphic for some positive integers $n$ and $m$ , then $R^n$ and $R^m$ are isomorphic as right $R$ -modules. This question has been asked before , but the answer is very short and doesn't work out the details. While working out the details, I've encountered some confusion. Since the answer given by Lord Shark the Unknown is short, I'll reproduce it here before asking about the pieces I've found myself confused about. Lord Shark the Unknown's answer: If $\phi:R^m\to R^n$ is a left $R$ -module isomorphism,   and $\psi:R^n\to R^m$ is its inverse, then they correspond   to matrices $A$ and $B$ over $R$ with $AB=I_m$ and $BA=I_n$ .   But then $A$ and $B$ correspond to right $R$ -module maps $R^n\to R^m$ and $R^m\to R^n$ which are inverse to each other. My work: Minor comment, it appears that $\phi$ is intended to correspond to $A$ and $\psi$ to $B$ , so I would think that $AB$ should correspond to $\phi \circ \psi= 1_{R^n}$ . Thus I'll assume that $\phi$ should be $\phi:R^n\to R^m$ and $\psi:R^m\to R^n$ . It's quite possible that something weird happens with noncommutative rings, and this was correct as is, and I'm missing something.  ( Later comment : It's also possible Lord Shark the Unknown was working with the transposes of the matrices that I'm thinking of, in which case these dimensions make sense). Then let $e_1,\ldots,e_n$ be the standard basis for $R^n$ , $f_1,\ldots,f_m$ the standard basis for $R^m$ .  Let $A=[\phi]$ be defined by $$\phi(e_j)=\sum_i A_{ij}f_i,$$ and $B=[\psi]$ be defined by $$\psi(f_i)=\sum_j B_{ji}e_j.$$ Ignoring that $\phi\circ \psi = 1_{R^m}$ , $C:=[\phi\circ \psi]$ should be the  matrix such that $$\phi(\psi(f_i))=\sum_k C_{ki}f_k,\newcommand\of[1]{\left({#1}\right)}$$ but $$\phi(\psi(f_i)) = \phi\of{\sum_j B_{ji}e_j} = \sum_j B_{ji}\phi(e_j)  =\sum_j B_{ji} \sum_k A_{kj}f_k =\sum_k \of{\sum_j B_{ji}A_{kj}}f_k.$$ Thus $C_{ki} =\sum_j B_{ji}A_{kj}$ . Hence $B^TA^T = C^T$ . Alternatively, if we regard $A$ and $B$ as being matrices over $R^{\text{op}}$ , we get $AB=C$ , as claimed. Now over $R^{\text{op}}$ we get $AB=I_m$ , $BA=I_n$ , or over $R$ , we get $B^TA^T=I_m$ , and $A^TB^T=I_n$ . This suggests that we should use the  transposes to define the maps for the right modules, since right linear maps won't reverse the order of multiplication. (If $\phi(v)=ws$ , $\psi(w)=ur$ , then $\psi(\phi(v))=\psi(ws)=\psi(w)s=urs$ ). Then if we define $$\tilde{\phi}(e_j) =\sum_i f_i B_{ji}\text{, and } \tilde{\psi}(f_i) =\sum_j e_j A_{ij},$$ we can check that $$\tilde{\phi}(\tilde{\psi}(f_i))  = \tilde{\phi}\of{\sum_j e_j A_{ij} } = \sum_j \tilde{\phi}(e_j) A_{ij} = \sum_j \sum_k f_kB_{jk}A_{ij}  = \sum_k f_k \delta_{ik} = f_i, $$ and similarly, we get $\tilde{\psi}(\tilde{\phi}(e_j))=e_j$ , so $\tilde{\phi}$ and $\tilde{\psi}$ are inverse isomorphisms. Questions: Is this the standard way to handle matrices over noncommutative rings? I.e., for left modules do we usually take the entries to lie in $R^{\text{op}}$ ? For right modules it appears that the entries lie in $R$ . Then taking transposes  gives an isomorphism between $\newcommand\op{\text{op}}\newcommand\Mat{\mathrm{Mat}}\Mat_{n\times m}(R^{\text{op}})$ and $\Mat_{m\times n}(R)$ ? Is this correct, and is it the standard way to think about these things? If anyone could let me know if I've understood the intent of Lord Shark the Unknown's answer, or if I'm misunderstanding, that would be very helpful. It feels like there should be a more conceptual way of thinking about what's going on here, by translating the matrix argument into an argument about $\operatorname{Hom}$ functors/dualization. Something like the following: Let $\phi: R^n\to R^m$ and $\psi: R^m \to R^n$ be inverse isomorphisms. Let $*$ denote the functor $\newcommand\Hom{\operatorname{Hom}}\Hom(-,R)$ . Then $\psi^*:R^{n*}\to R^{m*}$ and $\phi^*:R^{m*}\to R^{n*}$ are inverse  isomorphisms. $R^{n*}$ has a natural right $R$ -module structure so that $R^{n*}\simeq R^n$ as right $R$ -modules. The natural right $R$ -module structure should be simply right multiplication by elements of $R$ . I.e., if $\alpha \in \Hom(R^n,R)$ , and $s\in R$ , then define $(\alpha s)(x) = \alpha(x)s$ . As for the natural isomorphism with $R^n$ , it should be given by $\alpha \mapsto (\alpha(e_i))_i$ . Right linearity follows from the definition of the right action of $R$ on $\Hom(R^n,R)$ , injectivity follows from the fact that the $e_i$ generate $R^n$ , and surjectivity follows from the existence of $f_j$ such that $f_j(e_i)=\delta_{ij}$ , since $R^n$ is free.

Addition and multiplication procedure is defined as follows. $$(a_1,b_1)+(a_2,b_2) \overset{\text{def}}{=} (a_1b_2+a_2b_1,b_1b_2)\\(a_1,b_1)\cdot(a_2,b_2)\overset{\text{def}}{=}(a_1a_2,b_1b_2).$$ If one wishes to define such operations similarly on the set of equivalence classes by $\sim$ , that is on the set $(A \times A\setminus\{0_A\})/\!\sim$ , one must prove the operations agree with the relation $\sim$ . In other words, it must be shown these procedures give a well-defined function, not depending on the choice of representative from an equivalence class. Here is how I would prove the result in the case of addition. Let $(a,b)\sim(a_1,b_1)$ and $(c,d) \sim (c_1,d_1)$ be any pairs in $A \times A\setminus\{0_A\}$ . We need to show that $(a,b)+(c,d)$ is $\sim$ -equivalent to $(a_1,b_1)+(c_1,d_1)$ , that is $(ad+bc)b_1d_1 = (a_1d_1+b_1c_1)bd.$ Hence, look at the expression $E:=(ad+bc) b_1d_1$ . Using distributivity in $A$ , we have $E=(ad)b_1d_1+(bc)b_1d_1$ . Using commutativity (and associativity) of multiplication, $E=(ab_1)dd_1+(cd_1)bb_1$ . But because $(a,b)\sim(a_1,b_1)$ and $(c,d) \sim (c_1,d_1)$ , we may replace $ab_1=a_1b$ , and $cd_1=c_1d$ . Therefore, $E=(a_1b)dd_1+(c_1d)bb_1$ . Again via distributivity (and commutativity, associativity), finally $E=(a_1d_1+b_1c_1)bd$ . QED Here is how E. B. Vinberg does it in A Course of Algebra , page 130.

By the preceding discussion , it suffices to show that when we multiply both entries in one of the pairs $(a_1,b_1)$ or $(a_2,b_2)$ by the same element $c$ , their sum and product get replaced by equivalent pairs.

Thanks! Problem: Let n $\in$ $\mathbb{Z}$ with $n$ $\ge$ 3. Prove the following: (a) Z(D $_{2n}$ ) = 1 if $n$ is odd. (b) Z(D $_{2n}$ ) = {1, r $^k$ } if $n$ = $2k$ . Note that $r$ and $s$ generate D $_{2n}$ with the group presentation { $r$ , $s$ | $r$$^n$ = $s$$^2$ = 1, $rs$ = $sr$$^{-1}$ } Proof: part (a) Let $n$ $\ge$ 3 where $n$ $\in$ $\mathbb{Z}$ and $n$ is odd. For any x $\in$ Z(D $_{2n}$ ), x must commute with both $s$ and $r$ , since both are in $D_{2n}$ . Note that if $x$ commutes with both $s$ an $r$ , then $x$ commutes with any element of $D_{2n}$ since $r$ and $s$ generate D $_{2n}$ . Then for any x $\in$ Z(D $_{2n}$ ), we have $xr$ = $rx$ , where x is of the form $x$ = s $^j$ r $^w$ (any such element can be arranged into this form via the relation $rs$ = $sr$$^{-1}$ and the fact that $r$ and $s$ generate D $_{2n}$ ). Note that since r and s have finite order, the exponents are modulo n and modulo 2 for $r$ and $s$ respectively. Then we have  s $^j$ r $^w$$r$ = $r$ s $^j$ r $^w$ .   Which implies s $^j$ r $^{w+1}$ = s $^j$ r $^{w +- 1}$ In the case where the power of r on the RHS is $w$ - 1, it is clear we cannot have equality unless |r| = 1, which it is not. Note that if $j$ is even then we have only the $w$ + 1 case. Hence $x$ may be of the form $1$$r$$^w$ = $r$$^w$ . Also we have that x must commute with $s$ , hence $s$$x$ = $x$$s$ . Then $s$$r$$^w$ = $r$$^w$$s$ .  Which implies $s$$r$$^w$ = $s$$r$$^{-w}$ . Applying s $^{-1}$ to both sides we arrive at the task of finding when r $^w$ = r $^{-w}$ i.e when $w$ = $-w$ . But since r has finite order we have: $$ \bar{w} = (n-1)*w $$ where $\bar{w}$ is the residue class of w modulo n. Hence for some a $\in$ $\mathbb{Z}$$_+$ $$ w + an = wn - w $$ $$ 2w = wn - an $$ $$ 2w = n(w-a) $$ Now since 0 $\lt$ w $\le$ n we have that the LHS is greater than 0. Also since n $\ge$ w then (w-a) $\le$ 2, since otherwise the RHS would be greater than the LHS. So since n is odd we must have that (w-a) is even and hence (w-a) = 2, implying that 2w = 2n and hence n = w. Hence x = $r$$^w$ = $r$$^n$ = 1. So Z(D $_{2n}$ ) = 1. part (b) From the argument above any x $\in$ Z(D $_{2n}$ ) must be of the form $s$$^j$$r$$^w$ for j even and j $\in$ $\mathbb{Z}$ . Then x is of the form $r$$^w$ for $0$ $\lt$ w $\le$ $n$ . Since $n$ is even we have the equation below is satisfied when $2w$ = $n$ or $w$ = $n$ , since (w-a) $\le$ 2 but also (w-a) $\ge$ 0 for (w-a) $\in$ $\mathbb{Z}$$_+$ . $$ 2w = n(w - a) $$ Hence $r$$^w$ $\in$ Z(D $_{2n}$ ) when $2w$ = $n$ , as desired.","I have posted a proof below, and would appreciate it if someone could review it for accuracy.

Then for any x Z(D ), we have = , where x is of the form = s r (any such element can be arranged into this form via the relation = and the fact that and generate D ). Note that since r and s have finite order, the exponents are modulo n and modulo 2 for and respectively. Then we have  s r = s r .   Which implies s r = s r In the case where the power of r on the RHS is - 1, it is clear we cannot have equality unless |r| = 1, which it is not. Note that if is even then we have only the + 1 case. Hence may be of the form = . Also we have that x must commute with , hence = . Then = .  Which implies = . Applying s to both sides we arrive at the task of finding when r = r i.e when = . But since r has finite order we have: where is the residue class of w modulo n. Hence for some a Now since 0 w n we have that the LHS is greater than 0. Also since n w then (w-a) 2, since otherwise the RHS would be greater than the LHS. So since n is odd we must have that (w-a) is even and hence (w-a) = 2, implying that 2w = 2n and hence n = w. Hence x = = = 1. So Z(D ) = 1. part (b) From the argument above any x Z(D ) must be of the form for j even and j . Then x is of the form for w .

The paper is available here and attempts to prove a partial converse of one of Tarski's theorems ( here is the particular theorem they prove the converse of). Namely, they want to show that if $K$ is an infinite field, whose $\mathcal{L}$ -theory admits quantifier elimination (QE), where $\mathcal{L}=\{=,0,1,+,-,\cdot\}$ (i.e. the language of rings with identity), then $K$ is algebraically closed. They attempt to do this by contradiction. From here on out I will copy out bits of the proof and walkthrough what is clear, and what is not. We argue by contradiction. Let $K$ have an algebraic extension $K(\alpha)$ of degree $n>1$ . I get the degree has to be $n>1$ otherwise, $\alpha\in K$ such that $K(\alpha)=K$ , contrary to assumption. Let $f(y,\bar{x})=y^n+x_{n-1}y^{n-1}+...+x_0$ .

As I understand this, I think they are saying that $f$ is the minimal polynomial for $\alpha$ . So clearly, $y\in K$ cannot be a root of it. Otherwise, it would not be minimal. Clearly since $K\vDash\forall y\,(f(y,\bar{x}))$ Now, the paper goes on to assume that $\alpha$ is seperable over $K$ . I'm not entirely sure why? Does the proof become obvious if $\alpha$ is not seperable? After this part, I get very confused about what the authors are trying to do. Any help clarifying how I should read this proof would be appreciated. I'm especially having a lot of trouble seeing the relationships between $f(y,\bar{x})$ and the big $F$ polynomial. I think the crucial part of the proof I don't understand is these couple of sentences somewhere in the middle: Now $\{F_j(\bar{z})\}$ is algebraically independent over $K$ and $K$ is infinite.

Since one talks about a group in general terms, then the statement must hold also for a simple group,whereby the sequence will be trivial. But in the case $G$ is not simple, by definition it must be solvable and the statement must hold again.

But in the case is not simple, by definition it must be solvable and the statement must hold again. But then we read another statement in algebra books: ''Given the finite group it is solvable if one can find a sequence of subgroups and such that is abelian.'' To my understanding, since the second statement is more specific than the first one, one would conclude that the abelian groups as stated in the second statement are simple (in which case they will be isomorphic to cyclic groups of prime order), something that is not stated in books. At the other hand, since the first statement must be true also for solvable groups, we must conclude that the simple group must be abelian in the case of a solvable group. Can somebody comment on my conclusions and say what is wrong or true. Which statement implies which one, or, are they equivalent in the case of solvable groups ? One also reads in algebra books (I quote here Lang's book) the following: ''such a sequence already gives information about . To get a full knowledge of , one would have to know how these factor groups are pieced together.'' Can somebody explain through an example, what knowledge of we get through such a sequence and how to proceed to piece the factor groups together.
