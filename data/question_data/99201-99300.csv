I've been asked to show the following; $$\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{dz}{\cosh(z)} = \frac{\pi}{2}$$ Which, we're told, needs to be integrated around an appropriate contour, with the hint that this countour should be a rectangle with vertices at $-R$, $R$, $R + \pi i$, $-R + \pi i$, oriented in the positive sense. So, I started by noting that the function $f(z) = \frac{1}{\cosh(z)}$ is even, so we can say that, as $R \rightarrow \infty$, $\int_{-R}^{R} f(z)\cdot dz = PV \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(z)\cdot dz = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(z)\cdot dz$ So, now, we can evaluate the contour using Cauchy's Residue Theorem, noting that the only singularity to occur within this contour is $z = \frac{\pi i}{2}$, which has the residue $-i$, so the integral simply becomes; $$\int_C \frac{dz}{\cosh(z)} = 2 \pi i \times -i = 2 \pi$$ Then, I need to deal with the integrals above the real axis. So, let's do the following; $$\Gamma_{1} = \int_{0}^{R + \pi i} f(z) \cdot dz$$ $$\Gamma_{2} = \int_{R + \pi i}^{-R + \pi i} f(z) \cdot dz$$ $$\Gamma_{3} = \int_{0}^{-R + \pi i} f(z) \cdot dz$$ Then; $$\int_{\Gamma_{1} + \Gamma_{2} + \Gamma_{3}}f(z) \cdot dz = \int_{\Gamma_1}f(z) \cdot dz + \int_{\Gamma_2}f(z) \cdot dz + \int_{\Gamma_3}f(z) \cdot dz$$ $$ = \int_{0}^{R + \pi i} f(z) \cdot dz + \int_{R + \pi i}^{-R + \pi i} f(z) \cdot dz - \int_{-R + \pi i}^{0} f(z) \cdot dz$$ $$ = \int_{0}^{R + \pi i} f(z) \cdot dz + \int_{0}^{-R + \pi i} f(z) \cdot dz +\int_{R + \pi i}^{0} f(z) \cdot dz - \int_{0}^{-R + \pi i} f(z) \cdot dz$$ $$ = \int_{0}^{R + \pi i} f(z) \cdot dz +\int_{R + \pi i}^{0} f(z) \cdot dz = 0$$ Assuming I've done all of that correctly, I get; $$Lim(R \rightarrow \infty) \int_{-R}^{R} \frac{dz}{\cosh(z)} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{dz}{\cosh(z)} = 2\pi$$ And, as $f(z)$ is even, we have; $$\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{dz}{\cosh(z)} = \pi$$ What have I missed??

In either case, $\phi \circ f \circ \phi^{-1}$ has exactly one fixed point: zero.

15,Complex Analysis - Definition of Singular Point,Complex Analysis - Definition of Singular Point,,"I have been reviewing Dennis Zill's Complex Analysis text and he defines a singular point as a point $z$ at which a function $f$ fails to be analytic.

I've seen descriptions of singular points which seem to imply that they only include branch points, branch cuts and isolated singularities. There's also a definition from a Fullerton professor's page which goes like this: a point $a$ is a singular point if $f$ is not analytic at $a$ but every neighborhood of $a$ contains a point $b$ such that $f$ is analytic at $b$. But consider the complex function $f(z)=|z|^2$. This function is nowhere analytic, since it is only differentiable at $z=0$.

The question was, suppose that $f(z)$ is a holomorphic on $|z| <1$ and satisfies $|f(z)| < 1$ and $f(1/2)$ = 0. Use Schwarz Lemma to show that $|f(4/5)| \le 1/2$. I know that in general $\frac{a-z}{1-\bar{a}z}$ maps $a$ to $0$ and maps the unit disk to the unit disk. So $g(z) = f(\frac{1/2-z}{1-\bar{1/2}z})$ has $g(0)=0$. And for all $z$ s.t. $|z|<1$, since that above function maps the unit disk to the unit disk $\frac{1/2-z}{1-\bar{1/2}z} \in$ the unit disk. Thus $|g(z)| = |f(\frac{1/2-z}{1-\bar{1/2}z})| \le 1$. So Schwarz lemma applies to $g$ and we can conclude $|g(z)| \le |z|$. But $z = 1/2 \rightarrow \frac{1/2-z}{1-\bar{1/2}z}=4/5$ so the desired bound follows. Can you suggest better approaches?

So my questions are (1) Can you suggest any texts, preferably accessible online, that gives examples of such problems with good explanations? (2) So far, in reviewing past quals, I have only come upon one of these questions, so I have only one example to illustrate the type of problem. I think I was able to solve it, but I was mostly fumbling through it, are there general ways to approach it that would be better? The question was, suppose that $f(z)$ is a holomorphic on $|z| <1$ and satisfies $|f(z)| < 1$ and $f(1/2)$ = 0. Use Schwarz Lemma to show that $|f(4/5)| \le 1/2$. I know that in general $\frac{a-z}{1-\bar{a}z}$ maps $a$ to $0$ and maps the unit disk to the unit disk. So $g(z) = f(\frac{1/2-z}{1-\bar{1/2}z})$ has $g(0)=0$. And for all $z$ s.t. $|z|<1$, since that above function maps the unit disk to the unit disk $\frac{1/2-z}{1-\bar{1/2}z} \in$ the unit disk. Thus $|g(z)| = |f(\frac{1/2-z}{1-\bar{1/2}z})| \le 1$. So Schwarz lemma applies to $g$ and we can conclude $|g(z)| \le |z|$. But $z = 1/2 \rightarrow \frac{1/2-z}{1-\bar{1/2}z}=4/5$ so the desired bound follows. Can you suggest better approaches?

But, I do not have much of an idea as to how to turn this intuition into a proof. Does anyone have any suggestions? Even better, are there any general results about the limits of Riemann maps on domains which are ""almost disconnected"" which can be applied here?",,['complex-analysis']

96,Map Quadrant Conformally onto the Unit Disc and find $|g'(1+i)|$.,Map Quadrant Conformally onto the Unit Disc and find .,|g'(1+i)|,"If $w = g(z)$ maps the quadrant $\{z = x + iy \; : \; x,y >0\}$ conformally onto $|w|<1$ with $g(1) = 1$, $g(i) = -1$, and $g(0) = -i$, find $|g'(1+i)|$. My initial reaction was to directly compute the transform and then take the derivative, i.e. set $g(z) = \frac{az + b}{cz + d}$ and use the given data to solve for the coefficients. I was expecting something similar to $\frac{z^2 - i}{z^2 + i}$ but I ended up getting $g(z) = (1+i)z - i$. This satisfies the given data but doesn't seem to map the quadrant to the unit disc... I'm not sure if I am making some kind of algebra mistake or my approach is wrong.","If $w = g(z)$ maps the quadrant $\{z = x + iy \; : \; x,y >0\}$ conformally onto $|w|<1$ with $g(1) = 1$, $g(i) = -1$, and $g(0) = -i$, find $|g'(1+i)|$.

In general, what are the steps required to show that $f$ is (not) complex differentiable at a point $z\in\mathbb C$? EDIT: Made a typo on $f(z)$. I was also given an example of a $f(z)=exp(-z^{-4})$ to show that $f$ satisfies the Cauchy Riemann equations at $0$ but is still not complex differentiable at $0$.

99,Angle between Harmonic functions,Angle between Harmonic functions,,"I have a question about a practice prelim problem: What is the angle between the curves $Re(z^3) = 1$ and $Re(z^3) = Im(z^3)$? Also, What is the angle between the curves $Re(z^3) = 0$ and $Re(z^3) = Im(z^3)$? So for the first part I believe that we can use conformal maps preserve angles so we are just finding the angle between $x=1$ and $x=y$ in the $x-y$ plane where $z^3 = w = x+iy$.  However, this only works for $f(z) =z^3 $ and $f'(z) \neq 0$.  Thus, we cannot use this in the second part.  Any ideas for the second part would be greatly appreciated.
