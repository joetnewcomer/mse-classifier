0,Verifying the subspace topology with a topology defined in terms of neighborhoods,Verifying the subspace topology with a topology defined in terms of neighborhoods,,"In M.A. Armstrong's Basic Topology , he introduces the concept of a topological space by first defining it in terms of neighborhoods (rather than open sets). Here is his formulation (p. 13): We ask for a set $X$ and for each point $x$ in $X$ a nonempty collection of subsets of $X$ , called neighborhoods of $x$ . These neighborhoods are required to satisfy four axioms: (a) $x$ lies in each of its neighborhoods (b) The intersection of two neighborhoods of $x$ is itself a neighborhood of $x$ . (c) If $N$ is a neighborhood of $x$ and if $U$ is a subset of $X$ which contains $N$ , then $U$ is a neighborhood of $x$ . (d) If $N$ is a neighborhood of x and if $\mathring{N}$ denotes the set $\{z\in N |  N$ is a neighborhood of $z\}$ , then $\mathring{N}$ is a neighborhood of $x$ . This whole structure is called a topological space . He then defines the subspace topology as follows: Let $X$ be a topological space and let Y be a subset of X . We can define a subspace topology on Y as follows. Given a point $y\in Y$ take the collection of its neighborhoods in the topological space $X$ and intersect each of these neighborhoods with $Y$ . The resulting sets are the neighbourhoods of $y$ in $Y$ . One of the exercises in this section is to veryify that the subspace topology (as defined above) satifies axioms (a)-(d) and is, hence, a topology on Y . I was able to verify axioms (a)-(c) fairly easily; however, I can't seem to finish the verification of axiom (d). This is what I have so far: To verify axiom (d), suppose $y\in Y$ , $N_Y$ is a neighborhood of $y$ in $Y$ , and let $$\mathring{N_Y}=\{z\in N_Y | N_Y \text{ is a neighborhood of } z\}.$$ Observe that $\mathring{N_Y}\subset N_Y \subset Y$ and, by definition, $N_Y=Y\cap N_X$ for some neighborhood $N_X$ of $y$ in $X$ . Now let $$\mathring{N_X}=\{z\in N_X | N_X \text{is a neighborhood of }z\}.$$ By axiom (d), $\mathring{N_X}$ is a neighborhood of $y$ in $X$ . We will show that $\mathring{N_Y}=Y\cap \mathring{N_X}$ , which will show that $\mathring{N_Y}$ is a neighborhood of $y$ in $Y$ . I was able to prove that $(Y\cap \mathring{N_X}) \subset \mathring{N_Y}$ , but I have not been able to establish that $\mathring{N_Y} \subset (Y\cap \mathring{N_X})$ . If I take an arbitrary $z\in \mathring{N_Y}$ , then I know that $N_Y=Y\cap N_X$ is a neighborhood of $z$ in $Y$ , but I do not see how to deduce from this that $N_X$ is a neighborhood of $z$ in $X$ (and hence that $z\in \mathring{N_X}$ ). I feel like there is just something obvious that I am missing, or, perhaps, my intuition was wrong and $\mathring{N_Y}\neq Y\cap \mathring{N_X}$ , and axiom (d) is verified in some other way.

(Willard, General Topology, p. 45) Theorem : Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces and $f : X \to Y$.

Set $E = X - f^{-1}(V)$ and let $U = X - \operatorname{Cl}_X E$. It is easy to verify that, since $f(\operatorname{Cl}_X E) \subseteq \operatorname{Cl}_Y f(E)$, we have $x \in U$.

15,A Hausdorff $ k$-space is minimal $ KC$ if and only if it is compact.,A Hausdorff -space is minimal  if and only if it is compact., k  KC,"Atopological space is called $k$ - space if it has the property that any subset $S$ such that $ S \cap K $ is closed for all closed compact $ K $ is itself closed. The bellow theorem comes from "" THE FDS-PROPERTY AND SPACES IN WHICH COMPACT SETS ARE   CLOSED."" I have some problem with this theorem. * Theorem: *A Hausdorff $k$-space is minimal $ KC$ if and only if it is compact. Proof: The sufficiency is clear. For the necessity, let $(X, τ)$ be a non-compact space which   satisfies the hypothesis of the theorem. Define a new topology σ on X as follows:   $σ = \{U ∈ τ : a \not\in U \} ∪ \{U ∈ τ : a ∈ U , \quad   \text{X - U is   compact} \}$.   Clearly (X, σ) is a compact and σ ⊂ τ. we claim that   $(X, σ)$ is a $KC$-space.To this end, suppose that $ S ⊆ X$ is a compact subset   of $(X, σ)$. It is clear that $cl_{σ}(S) ⊆ cl_{τ} (S) ∪ \{a\}$ . There   are then two possibilities: If $S$ is a compact subset of $(X, σ)$ and (a) if $a \not\in S$, then then by the preceding remarks, S is compact, and hence closed, in $(X, τ)$   and so $X - S $ is an open $σ$-neighbourhood of a. Thus $a \not\in cl_{σ}(S)$ and so $cl_{σ}(S) = cl_{τ} (S) = S$. then $cl_{σ}(S) = cl_{τ} (S) $. (b) : If on the other hand, $a ∈ S$, then $cl_{σ}(S) = cl_{τ} (S)$ and so if $S$   is not closed in $(X, σ)$, then it is not closed in $ (X, τ)$ either. Since $(X, τ)$ is a $k$-space,   there is some compact set $C$ in $ (X, τ) $ such that $ C ∩ S $ is not closed in $ C$. Furthermore,   if the chosen compact set $ C $ has the property that $a ∈ C$, then since $(X, τ)$ is Hausdorff,   given $x ∈ cl_{τ} (C ∩ S) - (C ∩ S)$, we can find disjoint open neighbourhoods $ U, V $ of $x$ and $a$   respectively. Then $ C - V$ is a compact subset of $(X, τ)$ with the property that    $S ∩ (C - V ) $ is not closed in $ C - V $. Hence we have shown that it is   possible to choose$ C$ so that  $a \not\in C $. Then  $cl_{τ} (C ∩ S) ⊆ C $ is a closed, hence compact subset of $ (X, τ) $ which does not contain $ a$   and hence is also closed in $ (X, σ)$ . Thus $T = S ∩ cl_{τ} (C ∩ S)$ is a $σ$-closed subset of $S$ and   hence is compact in $(X, σ)$. However, since $a \not\in T$ , it follows that $T_{τ} = T_{σ}$ and hence $T$ is   compact in $(X, τ)$, a contradiction, since $x ∈ cl_{τ} (T ) - T$ .

Thanks.","Atopological space is called $k$ - space if it has the property that any subset $S$ such that $ S \cap K $ is closed for all closed compact $ K $ is itself closed. The bellow theorem comes from "" THE FDS-PROPERTY AND SPACES IN WHICH COMPACT SETS ARE   CLOSED."" I have some problem with this theorem. * Theorem: *A Hausdorff $k$-space is minimal $ KC$ if and only if it is compact. Proof: The sufficiency is clear. For the necessity, let $(X, τ)$ be a non-compact space which   satisfies the hypothesis of the theorem. Define a new topology σ on X as follows:   $σ = \{U ∈ τ : a \not\in U \} ∪ \{U ∈ τ : a ∈ U , \quad   \text{X - U is   compact} \}$.   Clearly (X, σ) is a compact and σ ⊂ τ. we claim that   $(X, σ)$ is a $KC$-space.To this end, suppose that $ S ⊆ X$ is a compact subset   of $(X, σ)$. It is clear that $cl_{σ}(S) ⊆ cl_{τ} (S) ∪ \{a\}$ . There   are then two possibilities: If $S$ is a compact subset of $(X, σ)$ and (a) if $a \not\in S$, then then by the preceding remarks, S is compact, and hence closed, in $(X, τ)$   and so $X - S $ is an open $σ$-neighbourhood of a. Thus $a \not\in cl_{σ}(S)$ and so $cl_{σ}(S) = cl_{τ} (S) = S$. then $cl_{σ}(S) = cl_{τ} (S) $. (b) : If on the other hand, $a ∈ S$, then $cl_{σ}(S) = cl_{τ} (S)$ and so if $S$   is not closed in $(X, σ)$, then it is not closed in $ (X, τ)$ either. Since $(X, τ)$ is a $k$-space,   there is some compact set $C$ in $ (X, τ) $ such that $ C ∩ S $ is not closed in $ C$. Furthermore,   if the chosen compact set $ C $ has the property that $a ∈ C$, then since $(X, τ)$ is Hausdorff,   given $x ∈ cl_{τ} (C ∩ S) - (C ∩ S)$, we can find disjoint open neighbourhoods $ U, V $ of $x$ and $a$   respectively. Then $ C - V$ is a compact subset of $(X, τ)$ with the property that    $S ∩ (C - V ) $ is not closed in $ C - V $. Hence we have shown that it is   possible to choose$ C$ so that  $a \not\in C $. Then  $cl_{τ} (C ∩ S) ⊆ C $ is a closed, hence compact subset of $ (X, τ) $ which does not contain $ a$   and hence is also closed in $ (X, σ)$ . Thus $T = S ∩ cl_{τ} (C ∩ S)$ is a $σ$-closed subset of $S$ and   hence is compact in $(X, σ)$. However, since $a \not\in T$ , it follows that $T_{τ} = T_{σ}$ and hence $T$ is   compact in $(X, τ)$, a contradiction, since $x ∈ cl_{τ} (T ) - T$ . But: can you explain that : why he said that "" (1) :$ C - V$ is a compact subset of $(X, τ)$ with the property that $S ∩ (C - V ) $ is not closed in $ C - V $ .

Although it uses topological notions, it isn't any precise mathematics, so maybe one cannot take it very seriously. Sometimes I try to picture an infinite set of points. Assuming that the space $E$ in which my visual imagination takes place is a simply connected bounded subspace of the plane $\mathbb{R}^2$, I can only visualize at most uncountably many points. But since $E$ is separable, so is every subspace and I can't really explicitly imagine uncountably many points, e.g. having a circle in mind: I couldn't decide whether there only lie denumerably points on it or not. I could decide for myself that there are uncountably many, but this I would consider cheating. But I sometimes try to explicity imagine a countable set, viz as discrete, which isn't possible for uncountable sets, again because $E$ is separable. Since it's also bounded such a subset cannot be closed therein, for otherwise it would be compact, and therefore finite. One example would be the set $\{\tfrac{1}{n};\; n\in\mathbb{N}\}$, but here again it's hard for me to tell if its visualization is indeed denumerable. This might be due to the feeling that visualized points have an actual ""size"" in my mind. And it seems that any bounded countable discrete set must locally look like this particular set because it must have an accumulation point outside of it.

The problem for me seems to be the phenomenon of an accumulation point, and I feel that there's no hope if ""too many"" of such points are actually in the set. I just don't know how many ""too many"" exactly is. Maybe one is already too much. And maybe it's enough if there's any accumulation point at all, i.e. not even in the set.

Second, observe that any rational $r\in(0,1]$ satisfies $$ f^{-1}(-\infty,r)=(\overline{V_r})^c. $$ On the other hand, $f^{-1}(-\infty,0)=\varnothing$ . Hence any open interval of the form $(q,r)$ where $q,r\in[0,1]$ , $q<r$ , and $r$ is rational satisfies the condition that $f^{-1}((q,r))$ is open. It follows from this and the above comments that $f^{-1}(W)$ is open for any open $W\subset\mathbb{R}$ , i.e., that $f$ is continuous, since any open interval $(a,b)\subset[0,1]$ may be written as a union of intervals of the form $(q,r)$ , where $r$ is rational, and $a\leq q<r\leq b$ .

This is a proof from Wade's ""An Introduction to Analysis""; I do not take issue with the theorem itself...just this particular proof of it. I will first copy the proof as stated before addressing the issue of its correctness Theorem :  If $ H $ is compact in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbf{f}: H \to \mathbb{R}^m$ is continuous on $H$ , then $\mathbf{f} \left(H \right)$ is compact in $\mathbb{R}^m$ Proof : Suppose $ \left\{ V_\alpha\right\}_{\alpha \in A \;} $ is an open covering of $\mathbf{f}\left(H \right)$ . Then $\left\{ \mathbf{f}^{-1} \left( V_\alpha \right)\right\}_{\alpha \in A}$ covers $H$ and, by continuity, its members are relatively open in $H$ . Thus for each $\alpha$ there exists an open set $O_\alpha$ such that $\mathbf{f}^{-1}\left( V_\alpha \right) = H \cap O_\alpha .\;$ Note that $\left\{ O_\alpha \right\}_{\alpha \in A}$ is an  open covering of $H$ and since $H$ is compact, there exists a finite subcovering $\left\{ O_{\alpha_j} \right\}^N_{j=1}$ .

The author notes this in his errata, but this introduces a further problem. We now have all equalities, so that $$\mathbf{f}(H) = \bigcup_{j=1}^N V_{\alpha_j} \quad \text{i.e. compact set = union of open sets}$$ That is, the set we are claiming is compact we have also shown to be open, and this will not be true in general. It must therefore be the case that one of the other equalities is actually a $\subseteq$ . It is actually the rightmost one. Recall that the $V_{\alpha_j}$ are an open covering of the image of $\mathbf{f}, \,$ $\mathbf{f}(H).$ , and will in general need to intersect its complement.
