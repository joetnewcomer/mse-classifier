Intuitively, I think it should converge conditionally because $ \sum \frac{(-1)^k}{\sqrt{k}}$ does, and the $(-1)^k$ in the denominator should not make a big difference. However, I am having trouble demonstrating its conditional convergence. Evidently, the problem is that $\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}+(-1)^k}$ is not monotone. Let's call this sequence $a_n$. If we can show that $$\sum_{k=2}^\infty |a_k - a_{k-1}| < \infty,$$ then we're done by Dirichlet's test. But this seems to be $O(1/k)$.
