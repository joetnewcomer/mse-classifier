One definition is the intersection of the ellipsoid with a cone emanating from the center of the ellipsoid. The other way I can imagine to define it is a plane intersecting the ellipsoid in which the plane does not also intersect the center of the ellipsoid (or else it would be a great circle). This Wikipedia article also discusses sphere-intersection, but it is limited to spheres, and I am interested in ellipsoids. Does anyone know if these two methods, cone intersection and plane intersection, result in the same curve? If not, which one is a small circle, and what would be the name of the other resulting curve?","I am trying to figure out the proper definition of a small circle on a biaxial ellipsoid of revolution.

Proving that","\square ABCD BC, CD DA AB AD + BC = AB","In a cyclic quadrilateral $ABCD$ , $BC, CD$ and $DA$ are three tangents of a circle. The center of the circle is located on the side $AB$ . Prove that $$AD + BC = AB$$ Attempt : First, I thought it to be very easy. So, I let the side $AB$ be the diameter of the large circle by which the quadrilateral $ABCD$ is circumscribed. So, I made another quadrilateral congruent to $ABCD$ to the opposite side. So, I got a regular hexagon, the one side of which is denoted as $a$ and the radius of large circle = $R$ and the radius of small circle = $r$ . We know that area of regular polygon = $\frac{na^2}{4} \cot \frac{180}{n}$ . $ABCD$ is the semi hexagon and so the area of $ABCD =\frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{6a^2}{4} \cot (\frac{180}{6})^\circ = \frac{3a^2}{4} \cot 30^\circ = \frac{3a^2}{4}\cdot \sqrt3 = \frac {3\sqrt 3a^2}{4}........(i)$ Again $ABCD$ is a trapezium. So, $[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2}(2R + a)\cdot r..........(ii)$ Now from right angled triangle $DJA$ : $\frac{r}{a} = \sin 60^\circ$ so $r = \frac{\sqrt 3a}{2}$ So, from equation $(ii)$ again, we get $[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} (2R + a)\cdot\frac {\sqrt 3a}{2} = \frac{\sqrt 3a}{4} (2R + a)........(iii)$ Now from equation $(i)$ and $(iii)$ we get $\frac{\sqrt 3a}{4} (2R + a) = \frac{3 \sqrt3 a^2}{4}$ and thus $(2R + a) = 3a$ so $2R = 2a$ . Hence, $R = a$ . And thus I proved that $2R = a + a \implies AD + BC = AB$ . But that wasn't a satisfactory solution for me in the case of letting $AB$ be the diameter of large circle and I reasonably made it specific. But I am very unaware of the fact that how could I solve that proof for any position of $AB$ such that other three sides of the quadrilateral $ABCD$ are tangents to the small circle?

Therefore there is an ordered pair $(\lambda,\mu)\neq (0,0)$ which renders the following equation of a conic circumscribing the quadrilateral ABCD: $$(\lambda +\mu)x^2 +0.xy+(\lambda +\mu)y^2+...=0$$ As $(\lambda +\mu)^2>0$ , the conic given by this equation must be an ellipse (and a real one and non degenerate, because this conic passes through four real points), and, more precisely, a circle, because of the equal coefficients of $x^2$ and $y^2$ , hence ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral, QED.

The table is driven by an eccentrically weighted rotary motor which excites vibrations in the Y and Z axes (green and blue respectively in the image below). Using 3-axis accelerometers on the table and at various points on the structure, I can record the excitation and response vibrations in each axis (example plot at 20Hz below). However, two sinusoids of differing amplitudes and phases define an elliptical polarization (the same data as above is plotted parametrically below). The Question Based on the answers to other Stack Exchange questions ( here and here ), I know that the parametric form of an ellipse, centered at the origin and rotated by an angle $\theta$ is $$ a_y(t) = A\cos\big(2\pi ft\big)\cos\big(\theta\big) - B\sin\big(2\pi ft\big)\sin\big(\theta\big)  $$ $$ a_z(t) = A\cos\big(2\pi ft\big)\sin\big(\theta\big) + B\sin\big(2\pi ft\big)\cos\big(\theta\big)  $$ where $A$ and $B$ are the major and minor radii respectively.

74,Is the mean distance to a body's surface times its area always proportional to its volume?,Is the mean distance to a body's surface times its area always proportional to its volume?,,"This question came up because the ideal gas law says that for, say, a gas enclosed in a bottle the pressure is: $ P \propto \frac{N \cdot T}{V}$ Where P: Pressure, N: Number of Gas particles in the bottle, T: Temperature and V: Volume of the bottle. I am only investigating the dependence on volume: The Pressure does not depend on the shape of the volume. I find it intuitive that the pressure would be inversely proportional to the bottle's surface area. I also find it plausible that the pressure would be inversely proportional to the average distance of a point inside the volume to the volume's surface, as the particles inside the volume will take more time to impinge on the surface (and cause a momentum transfer that causes pressure) the farther the particles are away from the bottle's surface. The average distance to the surface should be understood as the average over all points inside the volume and all solid angles subtending each point to the surface, and not averaged over the surface itself. This is because the average distance needed here should be a sum of the contributing distances weighed by the likelihood this distance will be traversed by a particle: This likelihood is identical for all directions. If one were to calculate the average by weighing the distances proportionally to the (infinitesimal) surface areas that are connected to the point whose average distance is being calculated, one would weigh those directions more that make a very small or large angle with the surface, as the solid angle cones intersect a larger piece of the surface there. I checked the conjecture for a sphere, and it seems to work, but I do not see how to extend this result to all ""well behaved"" volumes. Also, the proportionality factor between (Average Distance multiplied by Surface Area) and Volume would have to be identical for all body shapes....","This question came up because the ideal gas law says that for, say, a gas enclosed in a bottle the pressure is: $ P \propto \frac{N \cdot T}{V}$ Where P: Pressure, N: Number of Gas particles in the bottle, T: Temperature and V: Volume of the bottle.
