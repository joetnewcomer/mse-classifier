3,Limit of an integral (coming from random walks and networks) as $n\to\infty$,Limit of an integral (coming from random walks and networks) as,n\to\infty,"I have the following integral on hand $$I_n=\int_{0}^\infty\frac1x\left[1-\left(\frac{x-1}{x+1}\right)^n\left(\frac{x-i}{x+i}\right)^{-n}\right]\ \mathrm dx$$ I am trying to find out what $\lim_{n\to\infty} I_n$ evaluates to. I have a sneaking suspicion that the limit is infinite (which comes from a heuristic argument based on the fact that a uniform random walk on $\mathbb Z^2$ is recurrent), but I am not sure if this particular integral would diverge. My heuristics is as follows. I model my lattice $\mathbb Z^2$ as a resistance network $G$ , and then look at square sublattices $G_n$ centered at the origin. Then $G=\lim_{n\to\infty} G_n$ . Let us look at a unit current flow, such that the voltage at the origin is $V$ and at the boundary is $0$ . Then the probability of a random walk starting at the origin 'escaping' to the boundary of $G_n$ before returning to the origin is (by a standard theorem in electric networks) given by $$\mathbb P_0=\frac{r(0)}{R^{(n)}_{eff}}$$ where $r(0)$ is the resistance at $0$ (here it is $1/4$ ) and $R^{(n)}_{eff}$ is the effective resistance between $0$ and the boundary of $G_n$ . Since the random walk in $\mathbb Z^2$ is recurrent, this probability must go to $0$ , and thus the effective resistance must diverge (That the effective resistance diverges is shown by the fact that $R_{eff}^{(n)}\ge \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\frac{1}{2k+1}\to \infty$ , which is another method of showing the random walk is recurrent). If we now just try to evaluate the effective resistance between any 2 points $G$ physically, it quickly becomes a mess. Here's a nice walkthrough of how one goes about doing this. A more thorough mathematical treatment is in Probability on Trees and Networks by Russel Lyon and Yuval Peres , section 4.3. Also see this answer . The takeaway is that the effective resistance between the origin and any point $(m,n)\in\mathbb Z^2$ is given by $$R_{m,n}=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{x=0}^\infty\frac1x\left[1-\left(\frac{x-1}{x+1}\right)^{m+n}\left(\frac{x-i}{x+i}\right)^{m-n}\right]\ \mathrm dx$$ (see equation 14 in the walkthrough). I am looking at this integral with $m=0$ , and the constant factors stripped way to get my $I_n$ . Since the effective resistance should diverge however I look (this is probably not precise, but that is why I am calling this a heuristic), I am expecting this integral to diverge, but I am not sure to proceed. Any help is appreciated.","I have the following integral on hand I am trying to find out what evaluates to.

In particular, if: $$Lf(x) = \int_{X} k(x,y) f(y) du(y)$$ So then, naturally, if $\mathbf{A}$ is an $m,n$ matrix with entries $a_{ij}$ and $\mathbf{u} \in \mathcal{C}^{n}$, $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{u} \in \mathcal{C}^{m}$, we have: $(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{u})_{i} = \sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{ij} u_{j}, i=1 \ldots m$ So I always see something similar to the following statement: The entries $k(x,y)$ are analogous to the entries $a_{ij}$ of matrix $\mathbf{A}$ and the values $Lf(x)$ are analogous to the entries $(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{u})_{i}$ I have never seen any example or more detail regarding this statement. Can somebody make this a bit clearer? Here is my thought, the $x$ defines the 'row', while the $y$ defines the column. So then if we wanted to, we could define a sequence $\{x_{0}, x_{1}, \ldots\}$ to then 'sample' the output of the operator integral $L$. For instance, if $L$ mapped $f$ to a certain region $P$, we would want to define our sequence to exist only in this region $P$ in order to save computation. If in this region, the functions $Lf$ had significant norm/power only in a subspace or section of this region $P_{k}$, we could 'sample' this subspace only -- ie $\{x_{0}, x_{1}, \ldots\} \in P_{k}$ and still get a 'reasonable' approximation to the resulting function/signal $Lf$. Similarly, we could 'sample' $f$ on its domain with  $\{y_{0}, y_{1}, \ldots\}$ and reduce the computation even further, when the sequence captures 'most of the information' about $f$ that is.","So I am teaching myself more in-depth about integral operators and every once and awhile I see this little 'factoid', that integral operators are generalizations of matrix multiplications.

Show that   $$\lim_{n\to \infty}\left[ \int_a^bf(x)^n\,dx  \right]^{1/n}=\max_{x\in[a,b]}f(x).$$ My progress: A simpler version of the problem is to suppose $x_1, \dotsc, x_m$ are positive numbers, and show that $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\left( x_1^n + \dotsb + x_m^n \right)^{1/n} = \max_i x_i.$$ This we can do by showing that $\log \left( x_1^n + \dotsb + x_m^n \right)^{1/n} \to \log (\max_i x_i)$. $$\log \left( x_1^n + \dotsb + x_m^n \right)^{1/n} = \frac{1}{n}\log \left( x_1^n + \dotsb + x_m^n \right) = \frac{1}{n}\left( n\log\left( \max_i x_i \right) + \log \left( \left(\frac{x_1}{\max_i x_i} \right)^n + \dotsb + \left(\frac{x_M}{\max_i x_i} \right)^n \right)\right)\\ = \log\left(\max_i x_i\right) + \frac{1}{n}\log\left(\text{bounded}\right)\to \log\left( \max_i x_i\right).$$ Now with the case of a function being integrated, if we tried the same argument, letting $M= \max_{x\in [a,b]}f(x)$, we'd have $$\log \left( \left(\int_a^b f(x)^n\,dx \right) ^{1/n}\right) = \log M + \frac{1}{n}\log \left(\int_a^b (f(x)/M)^n \, dx \right),$$ and now the task is to show that the second term goes to zero. I see that it goes to zero if $\{x\mid f(x)=M\}$ has positive measure, since then the integral is bounded below by the measure of that set.

Thanks for the help,","I'm beginning analytic number theory and I see this formula in Apostol's book : If $f$ has a continuous derivative $f'$ on the interval $[y,x]$, where $0 < y < x$, then  $$ \sum_{y < n \le x} f(n) = \int_y^x f(t) \, dt + \int_y^x (t-[t]) f'(t) \, dt + f(x) ([x] - x) - f(y) ([y]-y). $$ The proof in Apostol's can be followed easily if one uses Riemann Integration. But since I meet with number theorists often I see more this kind of notation : $$ \sum_{y < n \le x} f(n) = \int_y^x f(t) d[t] = \text{something here I don't recall} - \int_y^x [t]f'(t) dt $$ because for some reason they can ""integrate $d[t]$ and it gives $[t]$"", which I don't understand, and I also don't really understand precisely what $d[t]$ stands for. I have done a measure theory course ; what I'm saying is that I don't understand all the details ; I understand that they ""integrate by parts with the measure $d[t]$"" which makes the proof quite simpler, but I don't understand the assumptions they make and how the details work out.

I am very sorry about this. I felt that in the future I must take care to ensure that this does not happen to me when I ask questions. $ $ 2. BACKGROUND A few months ago, I posted a question about the following integral $$ \int_0^1 \! \frac{x}{\operatorname{artanh}x} \, dx = \int_0^1 \! \frac{\sinh x}{x\cosh^3 x} \, dx = \frac{7\,\zeta(3)}{\pi^2} $$ where $\operatorname{artanh}x$ is the inverse hyperbolic tangent function. Furthermore, I computed the following integrals $$ \int_0^1 \!\!\! \int_0^1 \! \frac{\ln\frac1x - \ln\frac1y}{\ln\ln\frac1x - \ln\ln\frac1y} \, dx \, dy = \frac{7\,\zeta(3)}{\pi^2} $$ and obtained exactly the same results as the integrals above. Since the values of both integrals are equal, we get the conclusion that $$ \int_0^1 \! \frac{x}{\operatorname{artanh} x} \, dx = \int_0^1 \!\!\! \int_0^1 \! \frac{\ln\frac1x - \ln\frac1y}{\ln\ln\frac1x - \ln\ln\frac1y} \, dx \, dy, $$ but according to my friend, $$ \int_0^1 \!\!\! \int_0^1 \Biggl( \frac{\ln\frac1x - \ln\frac1y}{\ln\ln\frac1x - \ln\ln\frac1y} \Biggr)^{\!n} \, dx \, dy = \frac{\varGamma(n+2)}{2^n} \int_0^1 \biggl( \frac{x}{\operatorname{artanh} x} \biggr)^{\!n} \, dx $$ holds more generally for all positive integers $n$ where $\varGamma$ is the gamma function. My friend and I have not yet obtained the closed-form of the above integral. Therefore, I believe he has shown this only by deformation of the integral. So, I too would like to show this result only by the transformation of the integrals, without comparing the values of the integrals, but I cannot show it even for a case $n=1$ . $ $ 3.

In this case, the $r$ integral in $(1)$ is trivial and the integral takes the form: $$ I_P=\int_{0}^{2\pi}d\phi\int_{0}^{\pi}d\theta~\sin\theta\frac{3x^2y^2\cos^2\theta}{(y^2\cos\phi+x^2\sin^2\phi)\sin^2\theta+x^2y^2\cos^2\theta}. \tag{5} $$ The $\phi$ integral can be integrated with the help of Eq. 3.642.1 in Gradstein and Ryzhik's tables of integrals. Thereby, the $I_P$ takes the for: $$ I_P=3xy\int_{0}^{\pi}d\theta\frac{\sin\theta\cos^2\theta}{\sqrt{1+(x^2-1)\cos^2\theta}\sqrt{1+(y^2-1)\cos^2\theta}}. \tag{6}$$ Now the change of variable $k=\sqrt{1-x^2}\cos\theta$ bring expression $(6)$ to the form $$ I_P= \frac{(const) x~y}{(1-x^2)^{3/2}}\int_{0}^{\sqrt{1-x^2}} \mathrm dk \frac{k^2}{\sqrt{1-k^2}\sqrt{1-k^2\frac{1-y^2}{1-x^2}}}. $$ Did you notice how $I_G$ and $I_P$ are similar? Do you think a similar approach can be applied to my original problem? Please, let me know. Edit 2 The integral $(1)$ is also evaluated in Appendix A.4 of this thesis. However, there he used cylindrical symmetry. Edit: ended My bounty ended, and unfortunately, I don't have enough reputation to offer another one. My question was not solved.

As you can see in this following code performed in Mathematica IG[x_, y_, u_] :=       Sqrt[Pi/2] NIntegrate[(12  Pi x y)/(1 - x^2)^(3/2)     (v^2 Exp[-(u^2 x^2 v^2)/(2 (1 - x^2) (1 - v^2))])/(Sqrt[1 - v^2] Sqrt[1 - v^2 (1 - y^2)/(1 - x^2)]), {v, 0, Sqrt[1 - x^2]}]     IG[.3, .4, 1]     ** 4.53251 **  I[x_, y_, u_] :=   NIntegrate[(r^2 Sin[a] Cos[       u r Sin[a] Cos[b]] 3 x^2 y^2 Cos[a]^2 Exp[-r^2/        2])/((y^2 Cos[b]^2 + x^2 Sin[b]^2) Sin[a]^2 +       x^2 y^2 Cos[a]^2), {r, 0, Infinity}, {a, 0, Pi}, {b, 0, 2 Pi}] I[.3, .4, 1] ** 4.53251 ** the integrals $I$ and $I_G$ are equals. Indeed, since that they emerge from the same physical problem. So, my question is: what are the steps applied for that integral $I$ gives the integral $I_G$? Edit Since my question was not solved yet, I think  it is because it is a tough question, I will show a particular case of the integral $I$, letting $u=0$. I hope with this help you help me. In this case, the $r$ integral in $(1)$ is trivial and the integral takes the form: $$ I_P=\int_{0}^{2\pi}d\phi\int_{0}^{\pi}d\theta~\sin\theta\frac{3x^2y^2\cos^2\theta}{(y^2\cos\phi+x^2\sin^2\phi)\sin^2\theta+x^2y^2\cos^2\theta}. \tag{5} $$ The $\phi$ integral can be integrated with the help of Eq. 3.642.1 in Gradstein and Ryzhik's tables of integrals. Thereby, the $I_P$ takes the for: $$ I_P=3xy\int_{0}^{\pi}d\theta\frac{\sin\theta\cos^2\theta}{\sqrt{1+(x^2-1)\cos^2\theta}\sqrt{1+(y^2-1)\cos^2\theta}}. \tag{6}$$ Now the change of variable $k=\sqrt{1-x^2}\cos\theta$ bring expression $(6)$ to the form $$ I_P= \frac{(const) x~y}{(1-x^2)^{3/2}}\int_{0}^{\sqrt{1-x^2}} \mathrm dk \frac{k^2}{\sqrt{1-k^2}\sqrt{1-k^2\frac{1-y^2}{1-x^2}}}. $$ Did you notice how $I_G$ and $I_P$ are similar? Do you think a similar approach can be applied to my original problem? Please, let me know. Edit 2 The integral $(1)$ is also evaluated in Appendix A.4 of this thesis. However, there he used cylindrical symmetry. Edit: ended My bounty ended, and unfortunately, I don't have enough reputation to offer another one. My question was not solved. Perhaps to solve that it is necessary to make some physical consideration. Anyway, I thanks to all who helped me. If I can solve this, I put the solution here. I've solved this problem applying the Schwinger proper-time substitution: $$\frac{1}{q^2}=\int_{0}^{\infty}\mathrm{d\xi}~\mathrm{e^{-q^2\xi}} $$",,"['integration', 'trigonometry', 'definite-integrals', 'closed-form']"

I have always been working with expressions such as : \begin{align} \int fdx \end{align} Considering $dx$ as a placeholder and an indication on the variable for which f need to be integrated. the riemannian integral says that taking the limite of a defined sum turns $\Delta x$ Into $dx$. This definition never satisfied me. So I turned into lebesgue integral where $d\mu$ represent the measure that will provide a volume of the domain for which f need to be integrated. I was a little more happy with this ( despite the fact that lebesgue is a nice generalisation of riemann ) Then I was introduced to differential geometry and read that the infamous $dx$ represent the differential of the coordinate function x. Then I learned how to integrate differential form where the integral of a form is defined to be: \begin{align} \int \omega = \int f dx\wedge dy = \int f dx dy \end{align} ( i wrote the case of 2 forms to display the transition between the integral of the form and the integral it translate to )  At that point I was completly lost. My exposure to differential was that $df$ is a functional that takes a vector and return a scalar: \begin{align} df(X) = Xf \end{align} Then I read that differential can be interpreted as infinitesimals which doesn't really make sense to me. I see the operation $Xf$ as the directional derivative of the function f in the X direction. $df$ if mainly for me a change of perspective where instead of varying the function $f$ we vary the vector $X$ for the directial derivative. I also studied n-forms which made the whole buisness more confusing as my introduction to n-forms was that it an element of the antisymmetric tensor product space. So basically an n-form is for me a (0-n) tensor that is antisymmetric. Finally I have been exposed to interpreting $dx$ as the differential of the coordinate function on a manifold. Which is a form that happen to be a basis member of the cotangent space. So here are my questions : 1) How should we interpret $dx$ in the riemannian integral. As a placeholder ? A differential ? Something else ? 2) If it is ok to treat it as a differential, why do we do this ? What the differential is supposed to represent in the framework of integration since for me it is just a change of perspective on the directional derivative or an element of the tensor product space. 3) are they any relation between the measure used in lebesgue integration and differential forms ? 4) My main problem here is to reconcile all of the things I learned about integration and differential forms. I want to be able to glance at $dx$ in any situation without being afraid of the meaning of it. Thank you for any pointers or answers.","I have some questions regarding differential forms, notation, and integrals. i would like to point out that I read the other post in this forums regarding this issue with no succes.
