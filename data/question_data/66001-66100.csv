1,How many number of bracelets of length $n$ with black-white beads?,How many number of bracelets of length  with black-white beads?,n,"How many number of bracelets of length $n$ with black-white beads? I'm trying to find a formula for counting the number of such bracelets. What i've done so far is to think of the bracelets as binary strings with periods. I've noted that the total number of length $n$ bracelets is $2^n$ and that $2^n=\displaystyle\sum_{d|n}B_d$, where $B_d$ is a bracelet with period $d$. By Mobius Inversion, I have that $B_n=\displaystyle \sum_{d|n}\mu(n/d)2^d$. So $c_n= \displaystyle \frac{1}{n}\sum_{d|n}\mu(n/d)2^d$ gives the number. But when I test it for $n=5$, I get $c_5=6$ when i'm expecting $8$.

Consider the function $$f(n)=f(n-2)+f(n-3)+f(n-4)$$ where $f(n)$ represents the ways in which stamps so arranged give the sum as $n$ on the envelope.  Hence we need to find $f(10)$.

I've seen the ""Ways to sum $n$ with $k$ numbers"", but never where the different numbers are restricted by an upper bound. I'm not even sure how to proceed with this question. I have a python script to calculate this (in essence, it tries the $(k+1)^m$ possible sums, computes them, and returns the number of sums whose result is $n$). I do have some recurrence equations, but I'm almost 100% sure they don't help that much. By fixing the first number of the sum to be $0, 1, \ldots, k$, and writing $P(n, m, k)$ as the solution of the problem: P(n, m, k) = P(n,     m - 1, k) + # If the first number is 0              P(n - 1, m - 1, k) + # If the first number is 1              ...              P(n - k, m - 1, k) + # If the first number is k and P(n, 1, k) = 0 if n > k              1 if n <= k Can this be solved in a more elegant way than brute force?",,"['combinatorics', 'natural-numbers']"
