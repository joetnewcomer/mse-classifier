And I understand that we got to $2\left(3k+2\right)+1$, then dividing by $2$, but $5/2$ isn’t $2$.","I have my answer below but there is one step that I am not understanding...and maybe my brain is just not trained to understand it. Prove that if $n$ is an integer and $3n+2$ is even, then $n$ is even using a proof by contraposition. The contraposition would read: if $n$ is an integer and $3n+2$ is odd, then $n$ is odd.   $$ \begin{align*} n &= 2k+1 \\ &= 3\left(2k+1\right) + 2 \\ &= 6k+5 \\ &= 2\left(3k+2\right) + 1 \text{(this is the step I don't understand)} \end{align*} $$ Ok, so I understand everything up until the last step. I understand how I got to $6k + 5$, but what I don't understand is how I can prove that last statement? I know that $2\left(2k + 2\right) + 1$ means that the number is odd and the contraposition has now be proofed.

How many ways are there to choose e.) a dozen bagels with at least three egg bagels and no more than two salty bagels? In this question, I do have the right answer but not sure if I have the most efficient representation. Later, I will elaborate much more complicated scenarios using the same technique, and ask what then? My Representation: First of all, I represent the information in my head as suggested by the book, by Stars and Bars , where the bars represent the division of source items (in this case the 8 types of bagels each have a bar), and stars that represent the items chosen (in our case the dozen bagels chosen). I represent it, to something like this, $$|*||**|*\dots||$$ If the right of bar have nothing in between, then the bagel represented by the bar is not selected. If the right of bar of $z$ times in between, then the bagel represented by the bar is selected $z$ times. Now that we have a mental model of the problem, it is easy to see that we are just selecting the number of ways we are positioning $*$ or $|$. As the book mentioned, this can be reduced to a Combination problem, let $n$ be the number of choices (bagels types in our case), $r$ be the number of items chosen from $n$ bagels, (a dozen bagels in our case, $${{n + r - 1}\choose{r}}$$ $n-1$ since $n$ objects only need $n-1$ bars to divide them. That all being said, this is still not enough to solve the problem above, we need to factor in ""no more than two salty bagels"". With Stars and Bars , this can be represented by 3 cases, when when 0 salty bar is Thus we need to add the cases of 0 salty bagels, 1 salty bagels, 2 salty bagels. Suppose the first bar is the salty bagel, and the second bar is the second bagel, the rest have $x$ to represent variable stars. $$||*x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x$$ $$|*|*x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x$$ $$|**|*x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x$$ The combination of each are added below, $${{7 + 12 - 3 - 1}\choose{12-3}} + {{7 + 11 - 3 - 1}\choose{11-3}} + {{7 + 10 - 3 - 1}\choose{10-3}}$$ Problem: As you can see, the representation when the constraint is ""at least $b$ of this element"" is very easy. By having at least $b$ items of this element, there's only $r-b$ to choose, where $r$ is the number of element chosen. But to represent ""no more than $c$ elements are to be chosen"", I have to add instances when $0, 1, \dots, c$ elements are in the set. All the problems in this chapter of Generalized Permutation and Combination have this scenario, which if you ask me, does not sound very generalized. So, How do you efficiently represent ""no more than $c$ items of this elements"" problems? How do you represent when there's more than one ""no more than $c$ items of this elements""? (e.g. salty bagels and egg bagels demand for their own maximum items). The only think I can think of now is adding probabilities when $(0 salty, 0 egg), (0, 1), \dots (0, max_{egg}) \dots (max_{salty}, max_{egg}$.

96,Choosing a committee (combination problem),Choosing a committee (combination problem),,"A group of people is comprised of six from Nebraska, seven from Idaho, and eight from Louisiana. In how many ways can a committee of six be formed with two people from each state? ${^6C_2} \times {^7C_2} \times {^8C_2}\ $ Is this correct  ?? In how many ways can a committee of seven be formed with at least two people in each state? $\left({^6C_2}\right)(4!) \times \left({^7C_2}\right)(5!) \times \left({^8C_2}\right)(6!)$ I am actually not sure how to do this one. My intuition on this was that there must be at least $2$ from each state and I don't believe the order matters. Therefore it would be ${^6C_2} \times {^7C_2} \times {^8C_2}\ $ and then since there needs to be $7$ in total, there is a $4!$ possibility for the people from Nebraska to be picked since there's $4$ left. Or wait.. would it be ${^4C_1}$ which is simply $4$ times ${^6C_2}$ since I only need to pick $1$ person. I basically used the same logic for the $5!$ and $6!$. But I feel like I'm doing this completely wrong. Can anyone correct these for me.","A group of people is comprised of six from Nebraska, seven from Idaho, and eight from Louisiana.

97,Using Generating Series to Find Sum of Sides of Dice,Using Generating Series to Find Sum of Sides of Dice,,"Question: "" Let k be a non-negative integer.  Use the theory of generating series to find the expected value of the sum of the dots when k (6-sided) dice are rolled. "" I know that the generating series for this would be $(\sum_{n=0}^6x^n)^k$, but I'm having a bit of a hard time simplifying this solution at all.  Is there a way to simplify this to single summation? Originally I was under the impression it would be $\sum_{n=0}^{k*6}\binom{n }kx^n$ but that doesn't seem to be valid.  Any help is much appreciated, thank you.","Question: "" Let k be a non-negative integer.

According to WolframAlpha, there is no integer solution but I am completely confused as to what steps was taken to determine that. Before asking the question, I did try to solve this using brute force by plugging in some arbitrary numbers to see whether the square of that number mod $23$ gave me a remainder of $49$ but the procedure was quite tedious. Hence the reason I turned to WolframAlpha. Going back to the question, I want to know how WoflramAlpha determined that there was no integer solution to solving for $x$.","What is the procedure to solving $x^2$ $mod$ $23 = 7^2$?
