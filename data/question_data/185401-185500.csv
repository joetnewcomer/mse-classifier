0,Does $y = f(x)$ and $y=g(x)$ imply $f(x)=g(x)$?,Does  and  imply ?,y = f(x) y=g(x) f(x)=g(x),"Okay, this maybe a very dumb question but I can't seem to find a ""proper"" reason to show why this isn't true. In some calculus books or notes, I have come across questions where they sometimes begin by saying, ""If $y =f(x)$ and $y =g(x)$ are two functions and blah-blah..."" I'm curious, is this some ""abuse of notation"" thing because it should be clear from the context? Because should it not mean that $y =f(x) = g(x)$ ?. There is also another context where this is used— While making graphs. The question usually says graph $y=f(x)$ and $y=g(x)$ etc. Surely it is not a substitution, otherwise the two functions would be same. So what does equating (possibly multiple) functions to $y$ mean? Or what is the intended meaning when we say $y =f(x)$ and $y =g(x)$ ?","Okay, this maybe a very dumb question but I can't seem to find a ""proper"" reason to show why this isn't true.

1,Counting the Number of Closed Binary Operations That Are Commutative,Counting the Number of Closed Binary Operations That Are Commutative,,"I'm working my way through the Section 5.4 exercises for the Grimaldi textbook, and the book's answer to one of the exercises doesn't make any sense to me.  I was hoping someone could help me understand how it reaches its given answer. Here's the problem: Let $|A| = 5$ .  How many closed binary operations on $A$ are commutative? The book gives the answer $5^{10}$ , but that makes little sense to me.  When I do the problem, I get $5^{15}$ . Here's how I reach $5^{15}$ . There are $5$ functions that have double pairs (i.e., $f(a,a),f(b,b),f(c,c),f(d,d),f(e,e)$ ), and each of those has $5$ possible answers.  Thus, there are $5^5$ potential arrangements for those $5$ inputs.  For the rest of the inputs (which should be only $20$ , since $25-5=20$ ), each combination of inputs corresponds with another combination if the function is commutative (i.e., $f(a,b) = f(b,a)$ ).  So we only have to match half (i.e., $10$ ) of the remaining possible combinations with answers.  That leaves us with $5^{10}$ potential arrangements for the remaining $10$ possible inputs.  The total number of commutative operations should therefore be $5^{5} \times 5^{10} = 5^{15}$ , not $5^{10}$ . Given this discrepancy, I thought I'd share my thoughts for scrutiny and see if I'm missing something. Any help or insight on this would be greatly appreciated.

Result: Let $A,A_1,...,A_k$ be sets, for some positive integer $k$ , let $f: A \rightarrow A_1 \times ... \times A_k$ be a function and let $U_i \subseteq A_i$ for each $i \in \{1,...,k\}$ . Then $$f^*(U_1 \times ... \times U_k) = \bigcap_{i=1}^k f^*_i(U_i).$$ I will be using the map $\pi_i:A_1 \times ... \times A_k \rightarrow A_i$ defined by $\pi_i((x_1,...,x_k))=x_i$ for all $(x_1,...,x_k) \in A_1 \times ... \times A_k$ ( the projection map ). In addition, I will make use of the functions $f_i: A \rightarrow A_i$ defined by $f_i = \pi_i \circ f$ for all $i \in \{1,...,k\}$ ( the component functions of $f$ ) . Proof: In order to show that $f^*(U_1 \times ... \times U_k) = \bigcap_{i=1}^k f^*_i(U_i)$ , we have to show that each of the sets is a subset of the other. Let $a \in f^*(U_1 \times ... \times U_k)$ . We have that $f(a) \in U_1 \times ... \times U_k$ . Then $f(a)=(u_1,...u_k)$ with $u_i \in U_i$ for each $i \in \{1,...,k\}$ . By the definition of component functions, we see that $u_i = (\pi_i \circ f)(a)=f_i(a)$ for all $i \in \{1,...,k\}$ . Hence $f_i(a) \in U_i$ for all $i \in \{1,...,k\}$ . By definition, we have that $a \in f^*_i(U_i)$ for all $i \in \{1,...,k\}$ , so $a \in \bigcap_{i=1}^k f^*_i(U_i)$ . Therefore $f^*(U_1 \times ... \times U_k) \subseteq \bigcap_{i=1}^k f^*_i(U_i)$ . Now, let $b \in \bigcap_{i=1}^k f^*_i(U_i)$ . We have that $b \in f^*_i(U_i)$ for all $i \in \{1,...,k\}$ . By definition, $f_i(b) \in U_i$ for all $i \in \{1,...,k\}$ . This implies that $(f_1(b),...,f_k(b)) \in U_1 \times ... \times U_k$ , so $f(b) \in U_1 \times ... \times U_k$ . By definition, we conclude that $b \in f^*(U_1 \times ... \times U_k)$ . Therefore $\bigcap_{i=1}^k f^*_i(U_i) \subseteq f^*(U_1 \times ... \times U_k)$ .

I begin by finding the value of $|f(x)|$ first : $$|f(x)|=\begin{cases} |-1|, & -2 \leq x \leq 0 \\ |x-1|, & 0 < x \leq 2 \end{cases}=\begin{cases} 1, & -2 \leq x \leq 0 \\ |x-1|, & 0 < x \leq 2\end{cases}$$ Now, to determine what $|x-1|$ would be, we need to determine whether $(x-1)$ is positive or negative or zero. If $x-1 \geq 0$ , $|x-1| = x-1$ and if $x-1 < 0$ , then $|x-1| = -(x-1) = 1-x$ If $x-1 \geq 0$ , then $x \geq 1$ and if $x - 1 < 0$ , then $x < 1$ . We can now split the condition $0 < x \leq 2$ from the earlier definition of $|f(x)|$ as $0<x<1$ and $1 \leq x \leq 2$ , where $0<x<1 \implies |x-1| = 1-x$ and $1 \leq x \leq 2 \implies |x-1| = x-1$ So, $$ |f(x)| = \begin{cases} 1, & -2 \leq x \leq 0 \\ 1-x, & 0<x<1 \\ x-1, & 1 \leq x \leq 2 \end{cases}$$ Now, we need to define $f(|x|)$ . Here's what I do : $$f(|x|) = \begin{cases} -1, & -2 \leq x \leq 0 \\ |x|-1, & 0<|x| \leq 2 \end{cases}$$ Now, is the next step that I do here correct or even necessary? Now, $|x|$ can never be negative but can be zero when $x=0$ . So, the condition $-2 \leq |x| \leq 0$ can be replaced by $x = 0$ from which we obtain the following definition for $f(|x|)$ : $$f(|x|) = \begin{cases} -1, & x=0 \\ |x|-1, & 0 < x \leq 2 \end{cases} = \begin{cases} |x|-1, & 0 \leq |x| \leq 2 \end{cases}$$ I did the last one because we observe that $0$ is mapped to $-1$ and $|0|-1 = -1$ , so it will still be mapped to $-1$ if we put it in the second condition. So, basically, for any value of $x$ that is a part of domain of $f$ , $f(|x|) = |x|-1$ . Now, we add $|f(x)|$ and $f(|x|)$ to obtain $g(x)$ . $$g(x) = |f(x)| + f(|x|) = \begin{cases} |x|-1+1, & -2 \leq x \leq 0 \\ |x|-1+1-x, & 0 < x < 1 \\ |x|-1+x-1, & 1 \leq x \leq 2\end{cases}$$ . In the first condition, the value of $x$ is either negative or $0$ , so if it is negative, $|x| = -x$ and else, it is 0 which is also equal to $-0$ , which means that in the first condition, $|x|$ can be substituted by $-x$ . In the second and, the value of $x$ is always positive, so $|x| = x$ . So, we can substitute $|x|$ by $x$ in the second and third conditions and arrive at the definition of $g(x)$ that is : $$g(x) = \begin{cases} -x-1+1, & -2 \leq x \leq 0 \\ x-1+1-x, & 0 < x < 1 \\ x-1+x-1, & 1 \leq x \leq 2 \end{cases} = \begin{cases} -x, & -2 \leq x \leq 0 \\ 0, & 0 < x < 1 \\ 2x-2, & 1 \leq x \leq 2 \end{cases}$$ Now, I want to know if this process is correct and if there is some alternative, better approach to this problem.

40,How to understand quasi-inverse of a function f∘g∘f = f?,How to understand quasi-inverse of a function f∘g∘f = f?,,"Recently I was studying the quasi-inverse. Before I studied the quasi-inverse, I revisited the inverse and the left-right inverse. inverse function: Let $f : X → Y$ , $g : Y → X$ is inverse of $f$ , if only if, $f∘g = id_{Y}$ and $g∘f = id_{X}$ . It is easy to understand. right-inverse function: Let $f : X → Y$ , $g : Y → X$ is right-inverse of $f$ (or section of $f$ ), if only if , $f∘g = id_{Y}$ . It means that $f$ must be surjective and $g$ must be injective. It is also very intuitive. Now I start to study quasi-inverse: One thing I have to explain here is that the ""quasi-inverse"" does not seem to be a precise terminology and I can't find any information about quasi-inverse in wikipedia or nlab. (I study it because the form of ""quasi-inverse"" appears in many branches of mathematics, e.g. in category theory, adjoint functors needs to satisfy triangular identity. Although they are completely different, they are similar in form) Here, I use the definition of quasi-inverse from https://planetmath.org/QuasiinverseOfAFunction Let f:X→Y be a function from sets X to Y. A quasi-inverse g of f is a function g such that g:Z→X where ran⁡(f)⊆Z⊆Y, and f∘g∘f=f, where ∘ denotes functional composition operation. Note that ran⁡(f) is the range of f. In order to understand this formula intuitively, I drew the following diagram This formula seems to tell us that A function $g$ is a quasi-inverse of a function $f$ , if the restriction of $g$ to $ran(f)$ is the right-inverse of $f$ , i.e. $f ∘ g ∘ j_{ran(f)} = j_{ran(f)}$ Note: $j_{S}$ denote identity function on $S$ .

The condition $f^2(x):=f(f(x))=-x$ implies that $f$ is an odd function and, in particular, that $f(0)=0$ . To see this note that $f^3(x)=f^2(f(x))=-f(x)$ and also $f^3(x)=f(f^2(x))=f(-x)$ . Using this property one can see that $f$ cannot be differentiable in general, because then the chain rule applied to $f^2$ leads to $f'(f(x))\cdot f'(x)=-1$ and, for $x=0$ , this would be $f'(0)^2=-1$ .

50,"Defining a functor $\mathscr F:[\mathscr A,\mathscr B]^{op}\to[\mathscr A^{op},\mathscr B^{op}]$",Defining a functor,"\mathscr F:[\mathscr A,\mathscr B]^{op}\to[\mathscr A^{op},\mathscr B^{op}]","First attempt (disregard it and go to the second): I'm trying to prove that $[\mathscr A,\mathscr B]^{op}\cong [\mathscr A^{op},\mathscr B^{op}]$ . I started with defining a functor $\mathscr F:[\mathscr A,\mathscr B]^{op}\to[\mathscr A^{op},\mathscr B^{op}]$ as follows. On objects: $(F^{op}:\mathscr B\to \mathscr A)\mapsto (\mathscr F(F^{op}):\mathscr A^{op}\to\mathscr B^{op})$ where the functor $F(F^{op}):\mathscr A^{op}\to\mathscr B^{op}$ sends an object $A$ to $F(A)$ and a morphism $(f^{op}:A'\to A)$ to $(F^{op}(f^{op})=F(f)^{op}:F(A')\to F(A))$ . On morphisms: not sure. Given a natural transformation $\alpha=(\alpha_B:F^{op}(B)\to G^{op}(B))_{B\in\mathscr B}$ between $F$ and $G$ , we need to define a natural transformation $\mathscr F(\alpha)=(\mathscr F(\alpha)_A:\mathscr F(F^{op})(A)\to \mathscr F(G^{op})(A))_{A\in\mathscr A^{op}}=(\mathscr F(\alpha)_A:F(A)\to G(A))_{A\in\mathscr A}$ . I don't quite see how to define this in terms of $\alpha_B$ . Each $\alpha_B$ is an arrow in $\mathscr A$ , but we need $\mathscr F(\alpha)_A$ to be an arrow in $\mathscr B$ . I thought about taking $\mathscr F(\alpha)_A$ to be $F(\alpha_A)$ , but $\alpha_A$ (for $A\in \mathscr A$ ) doesn't make sense. Another attempt: Define $\mathscr F:[\mathscr A,\mathscr B]^{op}\to[\mathscr A^{op},\mathscr B^{op}]$ as follows. On objects: given a functor $F:\mathscr A\to \mathscr B$ , assign to it the functor $F^{op}:\mathscr A^{op}\to\mathscr B^{op}$ . (This $F^{op}$ is defined on objects by $F^{op}(A)=F(A)$ and on morphisms by $F^{op}(f^{op}:A'\to A)=F(f)^{op}$ .) Now take a morphism in $[\mathscr A,\mathscr B]^{op}$ . It is a natural transformation $\alpha^{op}: G\to F$ (where $F,G:\mathscr A\to\mathscr B$ are functors).

We first notice that the set has closure and is commutative. Indeed, \begin{alignat*}{2} 					\left(x\right)\circ\left(\frac{1}{1-x}\right) &= \left(\frac{1}{1-x}\right)\in F &&= \left(\frac{1}{1-x}\right)\circ \left(x\right)\\ 					\left(x\right)\circ\left(\frac{x-1}{x}\right) &= \left(\frac{x-1}{x}\right)\in F &&= \left(\frac{x-1}{x}\right)\circ \left(x\right)\tag{1}\\ 					\left(\frac{1}{1-x}\right)\circ\left(\frac{x-1}{x}\right) &= \ \quad\left(x\right)\in F &&= \left(\frac{x-1}{x}\right)\circ \left(\frac{x-1}{x}\right). 				\end{alignat*} Now, we clain that $x$ is the identity element of the set.

We would now like to show that $F$ is a cyclic group: Let us define the $n^{\text{th}}$ power $f^{n}$ of an element of $f\text{ of } F$ as the following $$f^n =\begin{cases} 			e & : n = 0 \\ 			f^{n-1} \circ f & : n > 0 \\ 		\left({f^{-n}}\right)^{-1} & : n < 0 		\end{cases}$$ where $e$ is the identity element of $F.$ We have to prove that every element in $F$ can be expressed as the power of a single element from $F$ . We claim this generator is $\frac{1}{1-x}$ . Indeed, $$\frac{1}{1-x}^{0}=x,\qquad \frac{1}{1-x}^{1}=\frac{1}{1-x},\qquad \frac{1}{1-x}^{2}=\frac{x-1}{x},\\$$ hence $F$ is the cyclic group of order 2 generated by $\frac{1}{1-x}$ . Namely, $$ F=\left\{\frac{1}{1-x}^{0},\frac{1}{1-x}^{1},\frac{1}{1-x}^{2}  \right\}=\left<\frac{1}{1-x}\right>.\\$$ All cyclic groups of equal order being isomorphic to each other, consider the bijection $\phi\colon\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}\to{F}\colon\phi(2^{n})=\frac{1}{1-x}^{n}$ . We would like to show this is a homomorphism from $\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$ to $F$ . Note that $\phi(2^{n})=\frac{1}{1-x}^{n}$ holds for all $n$ , for let $n$ be an integer such that $n = q k + r$ for $0 \le r < k$ . Now $$ 	2^n = 2^r,\qquad \text{and}\qquad \frac{1}{1-x}^r = \frac{1}{1-x}^n,\\ $$ thus $$ 	\phi (2^{n}) = \phi (2^{r}) = \frac{1}{1-x}^r = \frac{1}{1-x}^n. $$ Now let $x,y$ be in $\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$ . Since $\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}=<2>,$ it follows that there exist integers $s,t$ such that $$x=2^{s} ,\qquad \text{and}\qquad  y=2^{r}, $$ thus, \begin{align*} 			\phi(xy)&=\phi(2^{s}2^{t})\\ 			\qquad	&=\phi(2^{s+t})\\ 			\qquad	&=\frac{1}{1-x}^{s+t}\\ 			\qquad	&=\frac{1}{1-x}^{s}\frac{1}{1-x}^{t}\\ 			\qquad	&=\phi(2^{s})\phi(2^{t})\\ 			\qquad	&=\phi(x)\phi(y) 		\end{align*} so $\phi$ is a homomorphism.

94,Smooth continuation of a real function,Smooth continuation of a real function,,"Somehow I always knew we could continue a smooth real function to a larger domain uniquely. I can't seem to find such a result however and I am probably confusing it with the analytic continuation of a complex function. Thinking about this I am growing more and more convinced that the smooth continuation of a real function is not unique. For example I think I vaguely recall that in functional analysis we could construct multiple different functions, all of which had some desired asymptotic properties at infinity. Of course this is just on the level of intuition, but it seems to contradict the uniqueness of the continuation. Anyway, better to ask and be sure, so I should do this (somewhat) clearly... Given intervals $A\subset B\subset\mathbb{R}$ and a smooth function $f:A\longrightarrow\mathbb{R}$, can we find a smooth function $g:B\longrightarrow\mathbb{R}$, such that $g$ is unique and $g|_A=f$?","Somehow I always knew we could continue a smooth real function to a larger domain uniquely.

96,Rotate $xy=1$ by $\frac{\pi}{4}$ in a negative (clockwise) direction.,Rotate  by  in a negative (clockwise) direction.,xy=1 \frac{\pi}{4},"I was studying hyporbolae for the first time and noticed that $y=\frac{1}{x}$ is a rotated hyperbola. I had seen equations like $y=\frac{1}{x}$ before but never noticed they where hyperbolae. Anyway using geometry and the general form of a hyperbola, $\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1$, I realised that $xy=1$ is $\frac{x^2}{2}-\frac{y^2}{2}=1$ which has been rotated clockwise by $\frac{\pi}{4}$. I tried to rotate $xy=1$ using the rotation matrix: $ \left( \begin{array}{cc} \cos\theta & \sin\theta\\ \sin\theta & \cos\theta\end{array} \right)$ $$\left( \begin{array}{cc} \cos\theta & \sin\theta\\ \sin\theta & \cos\theta\end{array} \right) \left( \begin{array}{cc} x \\ \frac{1}{x}\end{array} \right)=\left( \begin{array}{cc} x'\\ y' \end{array} \right)$$ $$\frac{x}{\sqrt{2}}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}x}=x', -\frac{x}{\sqrt{2}}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}x}=y'$$ I used two methods. The first worked and the second did not. I'd like to know where I'm going wrong with the second approach. In the first approach I squared both sides of the above equations and then used simultaneous equations to remove the $x$. Then dividing across by $2$ gives the desired result. Just out of curiosity I tried another method. I first multiplied across both equations by $\sqrt{2}x$ and rearranged to quadratic form: $$x^2-\sqrt{2}x'x+1=0, x^2-\sqrt{2}y'x-1=0$$ I equated the solutions of each to get: $$\frac{\sqrt{2}x' \pm\sqrt{2x'^2-4}}{2}=\frac{-\sqrt{2}y' \pm\sqrt{2y'^2+4}}{2}$$ The $\pm$s are ugly but I figured I could get rid of them through a series of squaring. I tried a few different ways starting with roots on opposite sides, roots on the same side etc. but I can't quite get it through. Should this work or am I going down a dead-end road ? Ok I got it: $$\frac{\sqrt{2}x \pm\sqrt{2x^2-4}}{2}=\frac{-\sqrt{2}y \pm\sqrt{2y^2+4}}{2}$$ simplifies to  $$\frac{x^2}{2}-\frac{y^2}{2}=1$$","I was studying hyporbolae for the first time and noticed that $y=\frac{1}{x}$ is a rotated hyperbola.

97,Finding the domain of $(f \circ g)(x)$,Finding the domain of,(f \circ g)(x),"EDIT: turns out $\sqrt{\sqrt{x^{2}+3}-3}$ was actually right. In that case, that gives me a follow-up question of sorts. So the larger context of the original question was to find the domain of $(f \circ g)(x)$. Following the definition of the domain of $(f \circ g)(x)$ in my textbook (all $x$ in the domain of $g(x)$ such that $g(x)$ falls into the domain of $f(x)$), I first found the domain and range of $f(x)=\sqrt{x-3}$, which was $[3,+\infty)$ and $[0,+\infty)$ respectively. I next found the domain and range of $g(x)=\sqrt{x^{2}+3}$, which was $\mathbb{R}$ and $[\sqrt{3},\infty)$ respectively. From there, I reasoned that since the range of $f(x)$ falls within the domain of  $g(x)$, the domain of $f(x)$, $[3,+\infty)$ must also be the domain of $(f \circ g)(x)$. A graph of $\sqrt{\sqrt{x^{2}+3}-3}$ indicates otherwise. Thus, my (real, presumably) question is why $[3,+\infty)$ was the incorrect domain of $(f \circ g)(x)$. ORIGINAL QUESTION I was asked to evaluate $(f \circ g)(x)$ given the following functions: $$f(x)=\sqrt{x-3}$$ $$g(x)=\sqrt{x^{2}+3}$$ My first answer was that $(f \circ g)(x)=\sqrt{\sqrt{x^{2}+3}-3}$, which would make sense considering $(f \circ g)(x)=f(g(x))$.
