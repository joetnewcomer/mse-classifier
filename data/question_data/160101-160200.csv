I would like to collect in one place materials that are worth reading and covering these numbers. It’s not surprising that in the internet it’s possible to find an introduction, but most of these documents don’t present everything and I am looking need research tools useful for a scientist. Unfortunately people at my university tend to be interested in analytical branches of maths, that’s why I’m posting here. It seems that p-adic numbers remain quite unknown – even when building $\mathbb R$, the completion of $\mathbb Q$ with respect to usual absolute value, one rarely mentions that it’s possible to define another norm and get another field in the process, namely $\mathbb Q_p$. In my opinion books are the best source of knowledge. I already skimmed through four texts: p-adic numbers by F. Gouvea, p-adic Numbers, Analysis and $\zeta$-Functions by N. Koblitz, p-adic Analysis by A. Robert and last, but not least, p-adic Analyisis and Mathematical Physics by Vladimirov, Volovich and Zelenov. The problem is that they aren’t quite compatible with each other.

Robert admits that the Volkenborn integral will be more suitable, the last book defines normalized Haar measure that is invariant  with respect to shifts and then develops the theory of integration in $\mathbb Q_p^n$. (I'm not sure if it's not similar to the point of view of Koblitz). I’m also interested in reading articles (recently I have found Does it really converge? and it is pretty interesting) or learning the main theorems (by now I have discovered four: Ostrowski’s about absolute values on $Q$, Strassman’s about zeroes of power series, Hensel’s lemma and Hasse-Minkowski theorem about local-global principle - what are more?).

My questions are: What would be generated from a regular language with an infinite alphabet? What are the devices we use to extend this alphabet (such as periodic fractions and continued fractions)? I.e. if finite alphabet with just the juxtaposition was enough to construct all reals, what are we constructing when we use periodic fraction notation? If we construct reals as Cauchy sequences, then every term in these sequences is unique and the sequences are infinite: then how come we find a bijection from infinite sequences generated from infinitely many members and sequences generated from finitely many members? Alternate objections: Cauchy sequences (when used in the construction of real numbers) are convergent sequences, which would imply that every real number, written as such a sequence, must converge to something, but isn't this a restatement of the conjecture about normal numbers? I.e. doesn't convergence require that reals must have statistically predictable number of all digits? Since I don't know of that being proved, wouldn't decimal expansion of reals still be a conjecture, not a proved fact? I was trying to read this article: https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~wtg10/decimals.html which goes into more details about constructing reals in this way, but I don't feel satisfied with the paragraph where it talks about the least upper bound (which I know to be the distinguishing property of real number field, which rationals don't have).

Because I wanted to analyze things further I thought to apply that procedures to composites numbers $n$ as well instead only to primes $p$ - at least so far as possible. However, the Teichmüller-character is only defined for prime modules $p$ (and for instance its implementation in Pari/GP gives wrong results for non-prime arguments). So my question (to prevent attempts to reinvent the wheel or trying to quadrature the circle) is Q1: Is there a generalization of the Teichmüller-character to non-prime arguments known/possible? and optimally: Q2: how could I implement this algorithmically? Comment: I've a basic routine for this for the prime-arguments which seems to work even for composite (but squarefree) bases, but for composite $n$ containing primefactors to second or higher powers this method runs sometimes in impossible inversion in the modular computation (and also not all residue-classes can be used).

53,Differences between large numbers with many factors has little factors,Differences between large numbers with many factors has little factors,,"I apologise beforehand for the informality and lack of precision in this question but it is that way because it comes from only an intuition, nothing more than a heuristic argument. Say one has two large, relatively coprime numbers relatively close to each other ( relative to their own size) so that both numbers have a large amount of prime factors( large relative to the usual amount for numbers of that size) in their factorisations. Then, their difference is relatively small and cannot be divisible by any prime within the factorisations of the two large numbers. Hence, it seems reasonable that this small number must have a small amount of prime factors(relative to the usual amount for numbers of that size), since there are several primes it cannot be divisible by. Computing several such examples, I find that this is indeed mostly the case. Often, the difference of the two numbers is prime. What I am wondering is whether there are some rigorous ways to express this fact. I'm thinking maybe it would involve something about the distributions of the values of some function like the divisor function, the sum of divisors function, or the amount of prime factors function or something of the sort.

We've shown that $I$ satisfies the required properties so any such ideal contains $I$.  We need to show that for all $p,q \in T, p - q \in T$ and $\forall r \in R, \ rT \subset T$. Let $r\in R, p \in T$.  Then $\exists q \in R$ such that $p, q$ is such a pair.  Then $rp, q$ is automatically such a pair as anything dividing $p$ also divides $rp$.  Thus $T$ absorbs $R$. It's tougher to show that $p - q \in T$.   We know that $\gcd(p(x,y), q'(x,y)) \neq 1, \forall x, y \in S$ for some non-constant $q' \in R$.",,"['abstract-algebra', 'number-theory', 'polynomials', 'semigroups']"

Allow to me to elaborate on some discoveries I've made reading the above paper, and playing with sage: I understand that the function field over $\mathbf{C}$ for $X_0(N)$ is $\mathbf{C}(j,j_N)$, and that the $\mathbf{Q}$-function field given by $\mathbf{Q}(j,j_N)$ defines the curve $X_0(N)$ over the rationals. Thus, any modular function for $\Gamma_0(N)$ can be written as  rational function in $j$ and $j_N$. Now, for the case of level $N=1$ modular functions, it is stated in the paper that if $f$ is a modular function that has a fourier expansion at $\infty$ with rational coefficients, then $f$ in fact lies in $\mathbf{Q}(j)$, which seems intuitive. However, I have recently discovered that the analogous fact does not hold for modular functions for $\Gamma_0(N)$ that have a rational fourier expansion at $\infty$. Using a paper of Maier, I have been able to play with the hauptmoduln for $\Gamma_0(N)$ when the group has genus zero. These functions have rational $q$-expansions, but don't necessarily lie in $\mathbf{Q}(j,j_N)$. Indeed, using the function $t_2$ in his paper (a hauptmodul for $\Gamma_0(2)$ that has rational $q$-expansion), I computed that $$t_2(1/4\sqrt{-7} - 1/4)$$ is an algebraic integer of degree $2$. In particular, it is definitely not a rational number. On the other hand, the theory of complex multiplication ensures that both $j(1/4\sqrt{-7} - 1/4)$ and $j_2(1/4\sqrt{-7} - 1/4)$ are integers. Therefore, $t_2$ cannot lie in $\mathbf{Q}(j,j_2)$, since otherwise $t_2(1/4\sqrt{-7} - 1/4)$ would have to be rational as well. What is troubling about this fact is that, in the paper of Cox et al., it is stated that if $f$ is a modular function for $\Gamma_0(N)$ and if $\tau$ is an elliptic point of order $2$ for $\Gamma_0(N)^\dagger$, but not one for $\Gamma_0(N)$, then $f(\tau)$ must lie in the maximal abelian extension of $K=\mathbf{Q}(\tau)$ and that this follows from basic complex multiplication theory. Now, if it were the case that $f\in\mathbf{Q}(j,j_N)$, then I'd be happy to believe this, but I've just seen that this is not the case. Therefore, I don't see how basic complex multiplication theory says anything about the nature of $f(\tau)$ in this case. Lastly, as mentioned above, it is stated explicitly that for level $N=1$, we do know that such a modular function with rational $q$-expansion must lie in $\mathbf{Q}(j)$. Does this result remain true for $X_0(N)$ when it has genus zero? That is, after fixing a hauptmodul $h$ with rational fourier expansion, so that any modular function for $\Gamma_0(N)$ can be written as a rational function in $h$, is it true that those functions with rational $q$-expansions can be written as a rational function of $h$ with coefficients in $\mathbf{Q}$?

Marginal note: The theorem applies generally (in regard to random matrix theory) to the sine-kernel of local level correlation statistics for Gaussian Unitary Ensembles (Gaudin, Dyson, Mehta) and corresponding level repulsion.","Theorem - If the Riemann hypothesis would be true, and the Montgomery pair correlation conjecture (see linked article page 183-184) true too; let $p \in \Bbb P$ prime, $n \in \Bbb N$ and $$\mathcal V_p(n)=1-(n^{p-1}\mod p)$$ then$$\lim_{p\rightarrow \infty}\mathcal V_p(n) = \operatorname{sinc}(2\pi \,n)$$ and for the pair correlation of the non-trivial zeroes of the Riemann $\zeta$-function, holds $$r_2(u)=1-\operatorname{sinc^2}(\pi \,u) +\delta(u)=1-(\lim_{p\rightarrow \infty}\mathcal V_p)^2 +\delta(u)$$ with $u=2n$ ( even ). $\delta(u)$ stands for the Dirac $\delta$- function , $r_2(u)$ denotes the pair correlation function, describing the two point correlation of the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann $\zeta$-function.
