To my understanding, we have $x^1 = \cos s$ , so what does $\frac{\partial (-\sin s)}{\cos s}$ worth ? Does it mean I should express $-{\sin s}$ from $\cos s$ , which would give something like $-{\sin s} = \pm \sqrt{1 - (\cos s)^2}$ ?

If this structure group reduction corresponds to a closed section of $\mathcal{F}(M)/Sp(2n,\mathbb{R})$ then it is a symplectic structure. It is claimed in here that, as an integrable $G$-structure, a symplectic manifold is a Cartan geometry. So, if we want to describe a symplectic manifold as a Cartan geometry of type $(G,H)$ what are the possible choices of Lie groups $G$ and $H$? Different choices of $G$ and $H$ will give rise to homogeneous spaces $G/H $ that are related by model mutation. I am primarily concerned with the groups that give rise to a compact model $G/H$ for symplectic manifolds.",,['differential-geometry']

For which values can $M_a$ be given a topology and smooth structure making it into an immersed submanifold? My attempt: Let $F(x,y)=y^2-x(x-1)(x-a)$ so that $M_a=F^{-1}(0)$.\  Then $DF(x,y)=[-(3x^2-(2a+2)x+a)~~ 2y]$. Therefore, $0$ is a regular value of $F$ unless there is a point $(x,y)$ such that $$y=0,3x^2-(2a+2)x+a=0 ~\text{and}~ F(x,y)=-x(x-1)(x-a)=0.$$ In this case, $-x(x-1)(x-a)=0$ implies that $x=0$ or $x=1$ or $x=a$.\ When $x=0$, $3x^2-(2a+2)x+a=0$ implies that $a=0$. When $x=1$, $3x^2-(2a+2)x+a=0$ implies that $a=1$. The case $x=a$ gives the above values. Thus we have the following cases to consider: Case 1: $a=0, (x,y)=(0,0)$. When $a=0$, the point $(0,0)$ is local minimum of $F$, so $(0,0)$ is an isolated point of $M_0$, and hence $M_0$ can not be an embedded or immersed submanifold. my difficulty is in the following case: Case 2: $a=1, (x,y)=(1,0)$. when $a=1$, the point $(1,0)$ is saddle point of $F$, and thus the curve $M_1$ is self-intersecting at $(1,0)$. In such cases I saw examples saying it can not be an embedded submanifold but by giving an appropriate topology and smooth structure we can make  $M_1$ an immersed submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^2$. My difficulty is to justify how it cannot be embedded submanifold, and how we define the topology and smooth structure to make it immersed submanifold. Clearly for $a\neq 0$ and $a\neq 1$, $M_a$ is an embedded submanifold.",,['differential-geometry']

Thanks in advance.","The Laplace-Beltrami operator, $\Delta\colon \Omega^{k}(M)\longrightarrow \Omega^{k}(M)$ is defined as $\Delta=d\delta + \delta d$ where $d$ is the usual exterior derivative and $\delta$ is the codifferential: $$\delta=(-1)^{m(k+1)+1}*d*$$ where $*$ is the Hodge operator, $\alpha \wedge *\beta= \langle\alpha,\beta\rangle \text{Vol}$. I am trying to prove that if $f\in C^{\infty}(M)$, $\Delta f=-\sum_{i=1}^{m}\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial x_{i}^2}$. I have tried to do this: $\Delta f=(\delta d)(f)$ and  $$(\delta d)(f)=\delta\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{i}}dx_{i}.$$ Now, $*(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{i}}dx_{i})=(-1)^{i-1}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{i}}dx_{1}\wedge \cdots dx_{i-1}\wedge dx_{i+1}\wedge \cdots \wedge dx_{m}.$ Again,  $$\begin{split} d \left((-1)^{i-1}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{i}}dx_{1}\wedge \cdots dx_{i-1}\wedge \cdots \wedge dx_{m}\right)&=(-1)^{i-1}\frac{\partial ^2 f}{\partial x_{i}^2}dx_{i}\wedge dx_{1}\wedge \cdots \wedge dx_{m}\\ &=\frac{\partial ^2 f}{\partial x_{i}^2}dx_{1}\wedge \cdots \wedge dx_{m} \end{split},$$ and  $$*\left(\frac{\partial ^2 f}{\partial x_{i}^2}dx_{1}\wedge \cdots \wedge dx_{m}\right)=\frac{\partial ^2 f}{\partial x_{i}^2}.$$ In conclusion, I obtain that $\Delta f=(-1)^{m+1}\sum_{i=1}^{m}\frac{\partial ^2 f}{\partial x_{i}^2}$, instead of $-\sum_{i=1}^{m}\frac{\partial ^2 f}{\partial x_{i}^2}$. Can someone help me finding the wrong step? Thanks in advance.",,"['differential-geometry', 'differential-forms', 'laplacian']"

Let $p\in S$ be an elliptic point and let $r$ and $r'$ be conjugate directions at $p$ . Varying $r$ in $T_pS$ , show that the minimum value of the angle between $r$ and $r'$ is attained by a unique pair of vectors in $T_pS$ , which are symmetric with respect to the principal directions. My idea was to simply consider unit vectors in directions of $r$ and $r'$ respectively, say $w=\cos(\theta)e_1+\sin(\theta)e_2$ and $w'=\cos(\phi)e_1+\sin(\phi)e_2$ so that the angle between these two vectors would be given by $\displaystyle \cos(\theta)\cos(\phi)+\sin(\theta)\sin(\phi)$ . Now, remember that $\theta$ is varying and, since $r$ and $r'$ are conjugate, $\phi=\phi(\theta)$ . Taking the derivative of that last expression with respect to $\theta$ and making it equal to 0, we should be able to find the answer. I'm not very confident of this approach, though.

I am a beginner in differential geometry and in general relativity so I may say wrong things. This is what I understood from tensors. Tensors are object for which coordinates follows a specific transformation when a change of basis is done. If I define a tensor on a basis $A$, I automatically know its components on a basis $B$. The philosophy behind the object is to be able to define quantities that are ""absolute"" and don't depend on coordinates. For example $ds^2=dx^2+dy^2$ is also written in polar coordinates $ds^2=dr^2+r^2 d\theta^2$ but it represents physically the same distance : if I compute the scalar product between two vectors using either the first or the second basis, the result will be the same. So finally : can I say that tensors are mathematical object that are used to describe phenomenon that are absolute and don't depend on a given set of basis . For example if I take a n-contravariant and p-covariant tensor and I apply it on n vectors and p covectors the final result will not depend of any choice of basis. Also : why do we only define tensors as object that transforms as $m'^i_j=m^k_l \frac{\partial x^l}{\partial y^j}\frac{\partial y^i}{\partial x^k}$ and not more general transformations ? Is it because the tensors are constructed around the notion of vectors/covectors and we want that tensors applied on vector and covector give result independant of the coordinates. So all the tensors were constructed to ensure that applied on vector and covectors they give result indepent of coordinates. Indeed, we could imagine to create other objects that ensure basis-independant results with other object than vectors but it is just that we don't need them in practice (in general relativity we would'nt need them for example). My last question is juste to be sure that I understand well... or not.","I would like to check something with you. I am a beginner in differential geometry and in general relativity so I may say wrong things. This is what I understood from tensors. Tensors are object for which coordinates follows a specific transformation when a change of basis is done. If I define a tensor on a basis $A$, I automatically know its components on a basis $B$. The philosophy behind the object is to be able to define quantities that are ""absolute"" and don't depend on coordinates. For example $ds^2=dx^2+dy^2$ is also written in polar coordinates $ds^2=dr^2+r^2 d\theta^2$ but it represents physically the same distance : if I compute the scalar product between two vectors using either the first or the second basis, the result will be the same.
