If the partials exist at the point but are not continuous at a neighborhood around that point, then I can't see how a tangent plane at the point can exist because would not be a good approximation of the function near the point since the function would have discontinuous slope along certain direction(s)(by the definition of a partial derivative).

Lets write $P_S=\{ P_{1,S}, \ldots, P_{n,S} \}.$ Let $Q=\{ \cup_S P_{1,S}, \ldots, \cup_S P_{n,S} \}.$ If we write $A=[a_1,b_1]\times \cdots \times [a_n,b_n],$ is not hard to verify that $\cup_S P_{i,S}$ is a partition of the interval $[a_i,b_i].$ Hence $Q$ is a partition of $A.$ Now, for all subrectangle $S_i$ of $P \quad (1 \leq i \leq N),$ there are subrectangles $S_{1,i}, \ldots, S_{\alpha,i}$ of $Q$ such that $S_i=S_{1,i}\cup \cdots \cup S_{\alpha,i},$ which determine a refinement $Q_{S_i}$ of the partition $P_{S_i}.$ Then we have $U(f\vert_{S_i}, Q_{S_i})-L(f\vert_{S_i},Q_{S_i})<\varepsilon/N.$ Therefore \begin{align*} U(f,Q)-L(f,Q) =& \sum_{R}[M_R(f)-m_R(f)]v(R) \\ =& \sum_{i}\sum_{j}  [M_{S_{j,i}}(f) - m_{S_{j,i}}(f)]v(S_{j,i}) \\ =& \sum_{i} \left[ U(f, Q_{S_i})-L(f,Q_{S_i}) \right] = \sum_{i} \left[ U(f\vert_{S_i}, Q_{S_i})-L(f\vert_{S_i},Q_{S_i}) \right] \\ <& \sum_{i} \varepsilon /N =\varepsilon. \end{align*} Then $f$ is integrable. Note that there are several parts of my proof that are not proper and rigorously proved. For example, in this part: "" is not hard to verify that $\cup_S P_{i,S}$ is a partition of the interval $[a_i,b_i].$ Hence $Q$ is a partition of $A.$ Now, for all subrectangle $S_i$ of $P \quad (1 \leq i \leq N),$ there are subrectangles $S_{1,i}, \ldots, S_{\alpha,i}$ of $Q$ such that $S_i=S_{1,i}\cup \cdots \cup S_{\alpha,i},$ which determine a refinement $Q_{S_i}$ of the partition $P_{S_i}$ "". I tried to write proofs of that assertions (that, I consider, are intuitive if you draw rectangles in the plane), but I spent tons of time and made very cumbersome notation (that make the proof very unclear and really hard to follow) in proving those statements.

59,Differentiability of a scalar function of two variables --- problems with Stewart’s definition.,Differentiability of a scalar function of two variables --- problems with Stewart’s definition.,,"I’m feeling uncomfortable about how Stewart’s Calculus makes the transition from differentiability of functions of one variable to differentiability of functions of two variables. Namely, Stewart gives the following definition: Definition. A function $ f $ of two variables is said to be differentiable at $ (a,b) $ if the first-order partial derivatives of $ f $ at $ (a,b) $ exist and   \begin{align}   & ~ f(a + \Delta x,b + \Delta y) - f(a,b) \\ = & ~ {f_{\operatorname{x}}}(a,b) \Delta x +       {f_{\operatorname{y}}}(a,b) \Delta y +       {\epsilon_{1}}(\Delta x,\Delta y) \Delta x +       {\epsilon_{2}}(\Delta x,\Delta y) \Delta y, \end{align}   where $ \displaystyle \lim_{(\Delta x,\Delta y) \to (0,0)} {\epsilon_{1}}(\Delta x,\Delta y) = \lim_{(\Delta x,\Delta y) \to (0,0)} {\epsilon_{2}}(\Delta x,\Delta y) = 0 $. Note. Later on, he shows that this will follow if the partial derivatives exist and are continuous near $ (a,b) $, and I am fine with this. What first irked me is that I didn’t remember learning this definition, so I spent a while trying to understand it. Moreover, the only functions that I’ve found to motivate the need for such a definition are those that are not continuous at the point in question. For example, consider the function $ f: \mathbb{R}^{2} \to \mathbb{R} $ defined by $$ \forall (x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^{2}: \qquad f(x,y) \stackrel{\text{df}}{=} \begin{cases} \dfrac{x y}{x^{2} + y^{2}} & \text{if $ (x,y) \neq (0,0) $}; \\ 0                          & \text{if $ (x,y) = (0,0) $}. \end{cases} $$ Then $ f_{\operatorname{x}} $ and $ f_{\operatorname{y}} $ are defined at $ (0,0) $, but $ f $ is not continuous there. Here’s my quarrel. I don’t think that this is a natural extension from the one-dimensional case. In one dimension, differentiability at a point implies continuity at that point, but two dimensions, the existence of $ f_{\operatorname{x}} $ and $ f_{\operatorname{y}} $ at a point don’t imply the continuity of $ f $ at that point. My intuition, then, is that to extend the definition of differentiability to two dimensions, we should say that $ f_{\operatorname{x}} $ and $ f_{\operatorname{y}} $ exist and that $ f $ is continuous at the relevant point. This seems nice and simple, so I can’t imagine why Stewart would go with the awkward definition given at the beginning of this post, if this was indeed the case. It therefore seems that I should be wrong. If I am, can you give me an example of a function $ f $ that is continuous at $ (a,b) $, and $ f_{\operatorname{x}} $ and $ f_{\operatorname{y}} $ are defined at $ (a,b) $, but it isn’t differentiable there? Additionally, I have a rough outline of a proof in my head of why it should be true. The definition of a directional derivative gives $$   {D_{\mathbf{u}} f}(a,b) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a + h \Delta x,b + h \Delta y) - f(a,b)}{h}, $$ but expressing it as a gradient implies that $$   \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a + h \Delta x,b + h \Delta y) - f(a,b)}{h} = {f_{\operatorname{x}}}(a,b) \Delta x + {f_{\operatorname{y}}}(a,b) \Delta y. $$ However, for this limit to be true, it seems like the original awkward definition must follow, i.e., $$   \frac{f(a + h \Delta x,b + h \Delta y) - f(a,b)}{h} = {f_{\operatorname{x}}}(a,b)\Delta x + {f_{\operatorname{y}}}(a,b) \Delta y, $$ which implies that $$   f(a + h \Delta x,b + h \Delta y) - f(a,b) = {f_{\operatorname{x}}}(a,b)h \Delta x + {f_{\operatorname{y}}}(a,b)h \Delta y $$ without even the need for the functions $ \epsilon_{1} $ and $ \epsilon_{2} $. Edit 1 zhw. has given a nice counter example below. However, I’d now like to alter my questions. Would an alternative definition be that all the directional derivatives of $ f $ exist and that $ f $ is continuous at a given point? What if I now extend my original approach to say that $ f $ is continuous on a neighborhood of $ (a,b) $ and that $ {f_{\operatorname{x}}}(a,b) $ and $ {f_{\operatorname{y}}}(a,b)$ exist? Could you give me a counterexample now? Edit 2 zhw. has knocked down Question 2 of Edit 1 in his response to my comment to his original answer, so now I’m just wondering if Would an alternative definition be that all the directional derivatives of $ f $ exist and that $ f $ is continuous at a given point? I’m motivated to ask because (a) zhw.’s counter examples all have some directional derivatives that don’t work and (b) my attempted proof relied on the existence of directional derivatives.","I’m feeling uncomfortable about how Stewart’s Calculus makes the transition from differentiability of functions of one variable to differentiability of functions of two variables.

A function $ f $ of two variables is said to be differentiable at $ (a,b) $ if the first-order partial derivatives of $ f $ at $ (a,b) $ exist and   \begin{align}   & ~ f(a + \Delta x,b + \Delta y) - f(a,b) \\ = & ~ {f_{\operatorname{x}}}(a,b) \Delta x +       {f_{\operatorname{y}}}(a,b) \Delta y +       {\epsilon_{1}}(\Delta x,\Delta y) \Delta x +       {\epsilon_{2}}(\Delta x,\Delta y) \Delta y, \end{align}   where $ \displaystyle \lim_{(\Delta x,\Delta y) \to (0,0)} {\epsilon_{1}}(\Delta x,\Delta y) = \lim_{(\Delta x,\Delta y) \to (0,0)} {\epsilon_{2}}(\Delta x,\Delta y) = 0 $. Note. Later on, he shows that this will follow if the partial derivatives exist and are continuous near $ (a,b) $, and I am fine with this. What first irked me is that I didn’t remember learning this definition, so I spent a while trying to understand it. Moreover, the only functions that I’ve found to motivate the need for such a definition are those that are not continuous at the point in question. For example, consider the function $ f: \mathbb{R}^{2} \to \mathbb{R} $ defined by $$ \forall (x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^{2}: \qquad f(x,y) \stackrel{\text{df}}{=} \begin{cases} \dfrac{x y}{x^{2} + y^{2}} & \text{if $ (x,y) \neq (0,0) $}; \\ 0                          & \text{if $ (x,y) = (0,0) $}. \end{cases} $$ Then $ f_{\operatorname{x}} $ and $ f_{\operatorname{y}} $ are defined at $ (0,0) $, but $ f $ is not continuous there. Here’s my quarrel. I don’t think that this is a natural extension from the one-dimensional case. In one dimension, differentiability at a point implies continuity at that point, but two dimensions, the existence of $ f_{\operatorname{x}} $ and $ f_{\operatorname{y}} $ at a point don’t imply the continuity of $ f $ at that point. My intuition, then, is that to extend the definition of differentiability to two dimensions, we should say that $ f_{\operatorname{x}} $ and $ f_{\operatorname{y}} $ exist and that $ f $ is continuous at the relevant point. This seems nice and simple, so I can’t imagine why Stewart would go with the awkward definition given at the beginning of this post, if this was indeed the case. It therefore seems that I should be wrong. If I am, can you give me an example of a function $ f $ that is continuous at $ (a,b) $, and $ f_{\operatorname{x}} $ and $ f_{\operatorname{y}} $ are defined at $ (a,b) $, but it isn’t differentiable there? Additionally, I have a rough outline of a proof in my head of why it should be true. The definition of a directional derivative gives $$   {D_{\mathbf{u}} f}(a,b) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a + h \Delta x,b + h \Delta y) - f(a,b)}{h}, $$ but expressing it as a gradient implies that $$   \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a + h \Delta x,b + h \Delta y) - f(a,b)}{h} = {f_{\operatorname{x}}}(a,b) \Delta x + {f_{\operatorname{y}}}(a,b) \Delta y. $$ However, for this limit to be true, it seems like the original awkward definition must follow, i.e., $$   \frac{f(a + h \Delta x,b + h \Delta y) - f(a,b)}{h} = {f_{\operatorname{x}}}(a,b)\Delta x + {f_{\operatorname{y}}}(a,b) \Delta y, $$ which implies that $$   f(a + h \Delta x,b + h \Delta y) - f(a,b) = {f_{\operatorname{x}}}(a,b)h \Delta x + {f_{\operatorname{y}}}(a,b)h \Delta y $$ without even the need for the functions $ \epsilon_{1} $ and $ \epsilon_{2} $. Edit 1 zhw. has given a nice counter example below. However, I’d now like to alter my questions. Would an alternative definition be that all the directional derivatives of $ f $ exist and that $ f $ is continuous at a given point? What if I now extend my original approach to say that $ f $ is continuous on a neighborhood of $ (a,b) $ and that $ {f_{\operatorname{x}}}(a,b) $ and $ {f_{\operatorname{y}}}(a,b)$ exist? Could you give me a counterexample now? Edit 2 zhw. has knocked down Question 2 of Edit 1 in his response to my comment to his original answer, so now I’m just wondering if Would an alternative definition be that all the directional derivatives of $ f $ exist and that $ f $ is continuous at a given point? I’m motivated to ask because (a) zhw.’s counter examples all have some directional derivatives that don’t work and (b) my attempted proof relied on the existence of directional derivatives.",,"['multivariable-calculus', 'derivatives', 'partial-derivative']"

97,Find Surface Area Via a Line Integral (Stokes' Theorem),Find Surface Area Via a Line Integral (Stokes' Theorem),,"I am trying to use Stokes' Theorem to calculate the surface area of a parametrized surface via a line integral. The surface is the part of $z= x^2+y^2$ below the plane $z=5$. I know this can be done the usual way, without Stokes' Theorem , but there is another surface whose area I'm trying to calculate for which the usual way doesn't work well due to tough limits of integration. As stated in the question Un-Curl Operator , we can find the surface area via $\oint\vec{F}\cdot \vec{ds}$ over the curve of intersection of the paraboloid and plane, provided we can find a field $\vec{F}$ such that $\text{curl}(\vec{F})\cdot \vec{n}=1.$ This would mean that $$\text{curl}(\vec{F}) = \frac{\vec{n}}{{\Vert \vec{n} \Vert}^2},$$ so that, $$\text{curl}(\vec{F})\cdot \vec{n}=\left\Vert\frac{\vec{n}}{{\Vert \vec{n} \Vert}^2}\right\Vert\cdot\Vert \vec{n} \Vert=\frac{{\Vert \vec{n} \Vert}^2}{{\Vert \vec{n} \Vert}^2}=1,$$as required. But finding such a vector field has proven difficult. I first tried using the method described in the question Anti-Curl Operator , but realized that this wouldn't work because $\text{curl}(\vec{F})$ has a nonzero divergence. I then turned to the method described in an answer to the Un-Curl Operator question, known as the Helmholtz decomposition. The idea is that given our vector field, $\text{curl}(\vec{F})$ in this case, we can split it into a curl-free part and a divergence-free part: $$\text{curl}(\mathbf{F})=-\nabla\Phi+\nabla\times \mathbf{A}$$ I believe ( I could be wrong though ) that it remains only to find $\mathbf{A}$, since the first term will not contribute to the line integral around a closed path. However, this is where my confusion begins. According to Wikipedia , $\mathbf{A}$ is found as follows: $$ \mathbf{A}(\mathbf{r})=\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_V\frac{\nabla'\times\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}')}{\left\vert\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'\right\vert}\text{d}V' - \frac{1}{4\pi}\oint_S\mathbf{\hat{n}}'\times\frac{\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}')}{\left\vert\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'\right\vert}\text{d}S'$$ I do not know how to use this formula. Specifically, I do not know what most of the symbols represent in the context of this problem. What is the difference between $\mathbf{r}$ and $\mathbf{r}'$? What is the region of integration?

How would we use the Helmholtz decomposition to find the vector field $\mathbf{A}$ in this problem?","I am trying to use Stokes' Theorem to calculate the surface area of a parametrized surface via a line integral. The surface is the part of $z= x^2+y^2$ below the plane $z=5$. I know this can be done the usual way, without Stokes' Theorem , but there is another surface whose area I'm trying to calculate for which the usual way doesn't work well due to tough limits of integration. As stated in the question Un-Curl Operator , we can find the surface area via $\oint\vec{F}\cdot \vec{ds}$ over the curve of intersection of the paraboloid and plane, provided we can find a field $\vec{F}$ such that $\text{curl}(\vec{F})\cdot \vec{n}=1.$ This would mean that $$\text{curl}(\vec{F}) = \frac{\vec{n}}{{\Vert \vec{n} \Vert}^2},$$ so that, $$\text{curl}(\vec{F})\cdot \vec{n}=\left\Vert\frac{\vec{n}}{{\Vert \vec{n} \Vert}^2}\right\Vert\cdot\Vert \vec{n} \Vert=\frac{{\Vert \vec{n} \Vert}^2}{{\Vert \vec{n} \Vert}^2}=1,$$as required. But finding such a vector field has proven difficult. I first tried using the method described in the question Anti-Curl Operator , but realized that this wouldn't work because $\text{curl}(\vec{F})$ has a nonzero divergence. I then turned to the method described in an answer to the Un-Curl Operator question, known as the Helmholtz decomposition. The idea is that given our vector field, $\text{curl}(\vec{F})$ in this case, we can split it into a curl-free part and a divergence-free part: $$\text{curl}(\mathbf{F})=-\nabla\Phi+\nabla\times \mathbf{A}$$ I believe ( I could be wrong though ) that it remains only to find $\mathbf{A}$, since the first term will not contribute to the line integral around a closed path. However, this is where my confusion begins. According to Wikipedia , $\mathbf{A}$ is found as follows: $$ \mathbf{A}(\mathbf{r})=\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_V\frac{\nabla'\times\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}')}{\left\vert\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'\right\vert}\text{d}V' - \frac{1}{4\pi}\oint_S\mathbf{\hat{n}}'\times\frac{\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}')}{\left\vert\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'\right\vert}\text{d}S'$$ I do not know how to use this formula.
