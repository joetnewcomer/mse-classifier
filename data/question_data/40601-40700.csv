28,Is this explanation of normal subgroups and quotient groups correct?,Is this explanation of normal subgroups and quotient groups correct?,,"I apologize for the long post, but I'm currently a student finishing up his first semester in group theory. My introduction was pretty definition-heavy so I've found I can internalize concepts (such as quotient groups, normal subgroups, etc.) myself by forming my own way of motivating and teaching them intuitively. I'd like to know if my current presentation/understanding is correct. I think after learning about subgroups and Lagrange's theorem, a natural question is then if we can break down a group $G$ to better understand its parts and hopefully the whole $G$ (as is tradition in any analytical endeavor). But if we want to pull back any useful understanding of $G$ from this smaller group, it ought to preserve some structure of $G$ . That structure is exactly how the operation acts on elements of $G$ (since groups are just elements with an operation relating them). So for the sake of exploration, we pretend to have the magic function $\phi : G \rightarrow H$ that does exactly this for us–maps $(G, *_G)$ to some smaller part $(H, *_H)$ , then ask what we can say about $\phi$ . Our original goal was for $\phi$ to preserve the operation, i.e. for all $a, b \in G$ that $\phi(a *_G b) = \phi(a) *_H \phi(b)$ . The next thing I would observe is that since $H$ has smaller order, $\phi$ necessarily maps a multiple elements, say $a, b$ , in $G$ to the same element in $H$ . In this sense, $a$ and $b$ are ""equivalent"" under $\phi$ . Given that we have ""willed"" $\phi$ to operation-preserving, we can see that a natural way this arises by letting $ak = b$ for some $k \in G$ : $$ak = b \implies \phi(b) = \phi(a *_G k) = \phi(a) *_H \phi(k).$$ If we want $\phi(b) = \phi(a) *_H \phi(k) = \phi(a)$ then $\phi(k) = e_H$ . I think leads naturally to the definition of the kernel: it's a set of elements that maps to the identity, and makes $a$ equivalent to $b$ mod $\ker \phi$ . And in fact, as I've learned from this answer , we naturally get equivalence classes of elements that partition the group into cosets analogous to modular arithmetic. So, $\phi$ takes elements and puts them neatly into these equivalence classes (abstracting away some of the details in $G$ that look ""the same"" in $H$ , leading–at least for me–directly to the First Isomorphism Theorem). Then it makes sense to propose the map $\phi : g \mapsto g \ker \phi$ . The next question becomes what the operation of this $H$ looks like. We've established that elements of $H$ are cosets (and equivalence classes), so for two elements in cosets $g_1 \ker\phi$ and $g_2 \ker\phi$ , once combined by $*_H$ we'd want for the result to be in $g_1g_2 \ker\phi$ (modular arithmetic analogy works here as well). Set-wise, we might write $$g_1\ker\phi \cdot g_2\ker\phi = g_1g_2\ker\phi.$$ But does this come for free? For an element $g_1k_1g_2k_2 \in g_1\ker\phi \cdot g_2\ker\phi$ to look like $g_1g_2k$ for some $k$ , it must be that $k_1g_2 = g_2k_3$ for some $k_3$ . Set-wise this can be written as $g\ker\phi = \ker\phi g$ , i.e. left-costs = right-cosets and it turns out it indeed satisfies this condition and we are safe to proceed. So, in the end, we have designed $H$ , a broken-down version of $G$ . And how did we do it? By ""dividing out"" or ""quotienting out"" the information that looks the same under $\phi$ in $H$ – $\ker \phi$ . Thus we write $H$ as $G/\ker\phi$ , aptly called a quotient group. Although, you could flip this presentation, and instead of viewing from the kernel perspective, suppose $K$ is some arbitrary group. Then it must satisfy the condition of left-cosets = right-cosets (which we name normality because it is a nontrivial property that gives us a usable quotient) for $G/K$ to be a group, as $\ker\phi$ already does, and through satisfying normality automatically becomes the kernel of some homomorphism (namely the natural, which I've presented). My questions are: Is this presentation correct (on an intuitive level, I know there are lots of places for concrete proofs)? It feels right to me, but I also feel like I may have gotten definitions vs. implications mixed up. If so, does any textbook follows this approach that I can dig into? I think homomorphisms also can fit into this framework, given I suggest $\phi$ pretty early on, but how would non-surjective homomorphisms be explained?","I apologize for the long post, but I'm currently a student finishing up his first semester in group theory.

So, takes elements and puts them neatly into these equivalence classes (abstracting away some of the details in that look ""the same"" in , leading–at least for me–directly to the First Isomorphism Theorem). Then it makes sense to propose the map . The next question becomes what the operation of this looks like. We've established that elements of are cosets (and equivalence classes), so for two elements in cosets and , once combined by we'd want for the result to be in (modular arithmetic analogy works here as well). Set-wise, we might write But does this come for free? For an element to look like for some , it must be that for some . Set-wise this can be written as , i.e. left-costs = right-cosets and it turns out it indeed satisfies this condition and we are safe to proceed. So, in the end, we have designed , a broken-down version of . And how did we do it? By ""dividing out"" or ""quotienting out"" the information that looks the same under in – . Thus we write as , aptly called a quotient group. Although, you could flip this presentation, and instead of viewing from the kernel perspective, suppose is some arbitrary group. Then it must satisfy the condition of left-cosets = right-cosets (which we name normality because it is a nontrivial property that gives us a usable quotient) for to be a group, as already does, and through satisfying normality automatically becomes the kernel of some homomorphism (namely the natural, which I've presented). My questions are: Is this presentation correct (on an intuitive level, I know there are lots of places for concrete proofs)? It feels right to me, but I also feel like I may have gotten definitions vs. implications mixed up. If so, does any textbook follows this approach that I can dig into?

But I don't see how to generalise that to an arbitrary family of indexes (maybe infinite) $\beta$. Could someone please give me a hand? Thank you.",,"['abstract-algebra', 'ideals']"

Show that $L/K$ only has finitely many intermediate fields $M$ . I'd like to know if my following proof is correct or how I could improve it: Suppose $L = K(\alpha)$ . For every intermediate field $M$ let $f_M \in M[X]$ be the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ over $M$ . Then for every $M, M'$ we have $M \subseteq M' \iff f_M \in M'[X]$ . Now I wanna show that every $f_M$ uniquely defines the corresponding intermediate field $M$ : Let $M'$ be another intermediate field s.t $f_M \in M'[X]$ . Then by the above we have $M \subseteq M'$ and by the definition of $f_M$ and $f_{M'}$ it follows that $\deg(f_{M'}) \leq \deg(f_M)$ . Since every root of $f_{M'}$ in $M'$ is also a root of $f_M$ (I'm not sure about this one so in case this isn't necessarily true some clarification would be great!), we get $f_{M'} \mid f_M$ . However, since both polynomials are irreducible and monic, we have $f_M = f_{M'}$ which gives us $M = M'$ . Similarly we have that $f_M  \mid f_K$ in $L[X]$ for every $M$ . Now, since $L[X]$ is a UFD, we get: $$f_K = \prod_{K \subseteq M \subseteq L}f_M.$$ Since this factorization is unique and all factors are monic and irreducible there are no units in the product so we get: $$\deg(f_K) = \sum_{K \subseteq M \subseteq L}\deg(f_M) = n$$ which means there are only finitely many intermediate fields.","Let be a finite and simple field extension, so and .

77,Generalisation of euclidean domains,Generalisation of euclidean domains,,"Recently I wondered how dependent the definition of euclidean domains is of the co-domain of the norm-function. To be precise: Let's define a semi-euclidean domain as a domain $R$  together with a norm $\delta : R \rightarrow \alpha$ for an ordinal $\alpha$ (or even the class of all ordinals) such that for $f,g \in R\ \exists\ q,r\in R$ such that $f=qg+r$ and $\delta(r)<\delta(g)$. With the same argument as for euclidean domains semi-euclidean domains are principal-ideal-domains.  Are there any semi-euclidean-domains which are not euclidean? Thanks for your ideas, Takirion Edit: As the image of $\delta$ is well ordered (and as such isomorphic to an ordinal) we can assume that $\delta$ is surjective. Here is an idea that didn't work:  $\mathbb{R}^{\alpha}$, the ""Polynomial Ring"" indexed by an limit ordinal $\alpha$ with $\delta (f)=\deg(f)$, because if $\omega_1\in \alpha$ we can't divide $x^{\omega_1}$ by $x^2$. Edit 2: Using Zorn's Lemma we can find a minimal norm in terms of the partial ordering $f\leq g \iff f(a)\leq g(a)\forall a\in R$ for two norms f and g. To show this let $(A, \leq)$ the partial ordered Set of all norms from $R$ in an ordinal $\alpha$ (note that to use Zorns Lemma here \alpha has to be an ordinal and can't be be class of all ordinals). Let $f_1\geq f_2\geq f_3\geq ...$ be a chain in $A$. Set $f(a)=min\lbrace f_n (a)|n\in \mathbb{N}\rbrace$. It's easy to see, that f is a norm on R and by definition it is a lower bound for all the $f_n$. So by Zorn's Lemma we find a minimal Element $\delta^*\in A.\square$ As $\delta^*$ is minimal obviously $\delta^*$ is surjective on an initialsegment of $\alpha$ (so we just assume it is surjective on $\alpha$). If $\alpha \leq \omega$ $R$ is euclidean and we are done. If not we find $x\in R$ with $\delta^*(x)=\omega$. But as $\delta^*$ is minimal this means, that for each $n\in \mathbb{N}$ we find $y\in R$ such that $y=q*x+r \implies \delta^*(r)>n$. At the moment i hope that it either will be possible to show that such a $x$ can't exist, or that this property of some elements gives hints on where to look for semi-euclidean but not euclidean rings. I found another interesting thing: Given that there is any euclidean function on the ring, we can construct $the$ minimal norm explicitely by transfinite induction. We define $\delta^{-1}(-\infty)=0$ and $\delta^{-1}(\alpha)=\lbrace x\in R\vert\forall y\in R \exists q,r\in R:y=q*x+r, \delta(r)<\alpha \rbrace$ for every ordinal $\alpha$. If we have any euclidean function $\mu$ we see immediately that every $x\in R$ gets assigned a value $\delta(x)<\mu(x)$ which shows both, that $\delta$ is defined on all elements of $R$ and that it is minimal. That it is indeed an euclidean function follows directly from the definition.  By all the stuff above getting assigned a limit-ordinal is a property which belongs to an element and is essentialy independent of the euclidean function. So I guess if there is a semiceulclidean not euclidean ring those elements will be interesting objects to be studied.","Recently I wondered how dependent the definition of euclidean domains is of the co-domain of the norm-function. To be precise: Let's define a semi-euclidean domain as a domain $R$  together with a norm $\delta : R \rightarrow \alpha$ for an ordinal $\alpha$ (or even the class of all ordinals) such that for $f,g \in R\ \exists\ q,r\in R$ such that $f=qg+r$ and $\delta(r)<\delta(g)$. With the same argument as for euclidean domains semi-euclidean domains are principal-ideal-domains.  Are there any semi-euclidean-domains which are not euclidean? Thanks for your ideas, Takirion Edit: As the image of $\delta$ is well ordered (and as such isomorphic to an ordinal) we can assume that $\delta$ is surjective. Here is an idea that didn't work:  $\mathbb{R}^{\alpha}$, the ""Polynomial Ring"" indexed by an limit ordinal $\alpha$ with $\delta (f)=\deg(f)$, because if $\omega_1\in \alpha$ we can't divide $x^{\omega_1}$ by $x^2$. Edit 2: Using Zorn's Lemma we can find a minimal norm in terms of the partial ordering $f\leq g \iff f(a)\leq g(a)\forall a\in R$ for two norms f and g. To show this let $(A, \leq)$ the partial ordered Set of all norms from $R$ in an ordinal $\alpha$ (note that to use Zorns Lemma here \alpha has to be an ordinal and can't be be class of all ordinals). Let $f_1\geq f_2\geq f_3\geq ...$ be a chain in $A$. Set $f(a)=min\lbrace f_n (a)|n\in \mathbb{N}\rbrace$. It's easy to see, that f is a norm on R and by definition it is a lower bound for all the $f_n$. So by Zorn's Lemma we find a minimal Element $\delta^*\in A.\square$ As $\delta^*$ is minimal obviously $\delta^*$ is surjective on an initialsegment of $\alpha$ (so we just assume it is surjective on $\alpha$). If $\alpha \leq \omega$ $R$ is euclidean and we are done. If not we find $x\in R$ with $\delta^*(x)=\omega$. But as $\delta^*$ is minimal this means, that for each $n\in \mathbb{N}$ we find $y\in R$ such that $y=q*x+r \implies \delta^*(r)>n$. At the moment i hope that it either will be possible to show that such a $x$ can't exist, or that this property of some elements gives hints on where to look for semi-euclidean but not euclidean rings.

An exotic example Let $X$ be a set and $\mathscr B=2^{X\times X}$ be the set of all binary relations on $X.$ Since they are just elements of a power sets, binary relations can be unioned and intersected. Let's denote those operations in the standard way: $\cup$ and $\cap.$ It is known that $$\begin{eqnarray} \cap\longrightarrow\cup\\ \cup\longrightarrow\cap \end{eqnarray} $$ For two binary relations $\rho,\sigma\in\mathscr B,$ we define $$ \rho\circ\sigma=\left\{(x,y)\in X\times X\,|\,(\exists z\in X)\; (x,z)\in \rho\wedge (z,y)\in\sigma\right\}. $$ This is called the composition of binary relations. It is a well-known notion. Perhaps less known is the fact that $$\circ\longrightarrow \cup$$ I'll omit the easy proof. We can notice that there seems to be place for a ""dual"" operation.

We have $$\cdot\longrightarrow +$$ In $\mathbb N,$ we can define $\gcd$ and $\operatorname{lcm}$ to be the binary operations ascribing to a pair $(x,y)\in\mathbb N\times \mathbb N$ their positive greatest common divisor and positive least common multiple respectively. It is an exercise in elementary number theory to check that $$\begin{eqnarray} \gcd\longrightarrow\operatorname{lcm}\\ \operatorname{lcm}\longrightarrow\gcd\\ \gcd\longrightarrow\gcd\\ \operatorname{lcm}\longrightarrow\operatorname{lcm}\\ \cdot\longrightarrow\gcd\\ \cdot\longrightarrow\operatorname{lcm} \end{eqnarray} $$ Together with $\cdot\longrightarrow +,$ this gives four binary operations and seven distributive laws. An exotic example Let $X$ be a set and $\mathscr B=2^{X\times X}$ be the set of all binary relations on $X.$ Since they are just elements of a power sets, binary relations can be unioned and intersected. Let's denote those operations in the standard way: $\cup$ and $\cap.$ It is known that $$\begin{eqnarray} \cap\longrightarrow\cup\\ \cup\longrightarrow\cap \end{eqnarray} $$ For two binary relations $\rho,\sigma\in\mathscr B,$ we define $$ \rho\circ\sigma=\left\{(x,y)\in X\times X\,|\,(\exists z\in X)\; (x,z)\in \rho\wedge (z,y)\in\sigma\right\}. $$ This is called the composition of binary relations. It is a well-known notion. Perhaps less known is the fact that $$\circ\longrightarrow \cup$$ I'll omit the easy proof. We can notice that there seems to be place for a ""dual"" operation. Let's define $$ \rho\star\sigma=\left\{(x,y)\in X\times X\,|\,(\forall z\in X)\; (x,z)\in \rho\vee (z,y)\in\sigma\right\}. $$ I do not know the name of this operation, nor do I know if it has ever been studied. It is probably easy to believe that the complement function $$':\mathscr B\longrightarrow \mathscr B$$ provides an isomorphism $$(\mathscr B,\circ)\cong(\mathscr B,\star).$$ It may therefore be as easy to believe that $$\star\longrightarrow\cap$$ This gives us four binary operations on $\mathscr B$ interconnected by four distributive laws. (This seems to be an extremely strange structure. I do have a question about it, although I'm not sure if it's a good idea to ask it here, as it's probably as far from anybody's interest as can be.)",,['abstract-algebra']

For the degree of the splitting field of $f$ over $\Bbb Q$, I argued that it is $100$ since the compositum $\Bbb Q(\sqrt[5] 7,\alpha)\Bbb Q(\sqrt[5] 3,\alpha)=\Bbb Q(\sqrt[5] 3,\sqrt[5] 7,\alpha)$ has degree $5\cdot 5\cdot 4=100$ over $\Bbb Q$. $\color{red}{\text{Does this make sense}}$? I also had another question to determine the Galois group of $(x^3-2)(x^4-2)$ over $\Bbb Q$. I showed that $x^3-2$ has Galois group $S_3$ and $x^4-2$ has Galois group $D_4$. Then I argued that the intersection of the two splitting fields, $\Bbb Q(\sqrt[3]2,\omega)\cap\Bbb Q(\sqrt[4]2,i)$ is just $\Bbb Q$, so we have $\operatorname{Gal}((x^3-2)(x^4-2)/\Bbb Q)\cong S_3\times D_4$. $\color{red}{\text{Does this make sense}}$? In order to show $\Bbb Q(\sqrt[3]2,\omega)\cap\Bbb Q(\sqrt[4]2,i)=\Bbb Q$ I just argued that $\sqrt[4]2,i\notin\Bbb Q(\sqrt[3]2,\omega)$, $\color{red}{\text{is this sufficient}}$?",,"['abstract-algebra', 'galois-theory', 'extension-field']"
