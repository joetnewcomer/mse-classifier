44,Is there an equation for the number of iterations required to escape the Mandelbrot Set's bounding circle?,Is there an equation for the number of iterations required to escape the Mandelbrot Set's bounding circle?,,"The Mandelbrot Set is the set of all complex values $c$ that cause the recurrence relation $z_n = z_{n-1} + c$ to remain bounded within a circle of radius 2 when iterated from $z_0 = 0$ . In general, there is no way to prove that a given value of $c$ is a member of the set. Instead, we iterate the recurrence relation some large number of times until we either find some value of $n$ where $|z_n| > 2$ (proving that the current value of $c$ is not in the set) or give up and declare that the current value of $c$ is probably part of the set (or at least very close to it). When the value of $c$ is far from the set, $z_n$ quickly escapes the bounding circle. As $c$ gets closer to the set, the number of iterations $n$ required to exceed the bounding circle grows without bound. If we look at values of $c$ on the positive real axis only and plot how many iterations it takes to exceed the bounding circle, we get a graph like this: If $c$ is greater than two, it only takes one iteration to escape the circle because $z_0$ is always zero and $z_1$ is always $c$ . When $1 < c ‚â§ 2$ it takes two iterations. The next twelve transition values are approximately 0.68233, 0.5352, 0.4537, 0.4034, 0.36999, 0.34659, 0.32952, 0.31666, 0.30672, 0.29887, 0.29256, and 0.28741 ‚Äî that's as far as I can get with WolframAlpha. Positive real values of $c$ less than or equal to 0.25 are part of the Mandelbrot Set and will never escape even after infinitely many iterations. To me, that looks very much like a graph of $1/x$ with some scaling and translating (for example, the vertical asymptote is at $x = 0.25$ ), but I can't find an equation that fits perfectly. Is there a formula that fits these points exactly? UPDATE based on responses from PM 2Ring and Claude As the distance $\epsilon$ from the boundary of the set tends towards zero on the positive real axis, the number of iterations required for escape tends towards $\frac{œÄ} {\sqrt{œµ}}$ . As $œµ$ increases to 1.75 along the positive real axis, the relationship changes to $\frac{2\sqrt{1.75}} {\sqrt{œµ}}$ . It seems like I need some function $v(œµ)$ such that $\frac{v(œµ)} {\sqrt{œµ}}$ fits my points exactly. Based on the points I have, it looks like this: UPDATE 2 I calculated the iteration counts for $c = -0.75 + œµ i$ and discovered that approaching the boundary of the set from this direction is more closely approximated by $\frac{œÄ}{œµ}$ than by $\frac{œÄ}{\sqrt{œµ}}$ . As in the first approach, the actual iteration count starts out far from the function and approaches it as $œµ$ goes to zero, though it wobbles around more than it does when approaching from the positive real axis.

46,Expressing functions $n\to n$ as evaluation of polynomials mod $n$,Expressing functions  as evaluation of polynomials mod,n\to n n,"Consider $f:n\to n$ where $n:=\{0,1,2,\ldots,n-1\}$ . We can associate to $f$ a polynomial $P_f$ of degree $<n$ by defining $P_f(x)=f(0)x^0+f(1)x^1+\cdots +f(n-1)x^{n-1}$ . This gives another way to evaluate $f$ : we have the literal function evaluation $x\mapsto f(x)$ , and the ""fancy"" evaluation $x\mapsto \sum_{k<n}f(k)x^k$ . I wish to understand a connection between these two evaluations. Question: For $f:n\to n$ , is there some polynomial $P(x)$ which evaluates to $P(x)\equiv f(x)$ (mod $n$ ) for all $x\in \mathbb{N}$ ? What I've done: Assuming $n$ is prime, we only need to consider polynomials of degree $<n$ since by Fermat's Little Theorem $x^n\equiv x$ . My idea was to find polynomials $i_k(x)$ which evaluate to the indicator function of the singleton $\{k\}$ so that $i_k(x)\equiv \begin{cases}1&x=k\\0&\text{else}\end{cases}$ Once we have these, every function can be written as a linear combination of the $i_k$ by $\left(\sum_{k<n}f(k)\cdot i_k\right)(x)\equiv f(x)$ . To find these $i_k$ , I used linear algebra to go in reverse. We start with the $n\times n $ matrix of the powers of $k<n$ reduced mod $n$ . That is, $A_{i,j}=i^j$ . For example, for $n=3$ this matrix is $A_3:=\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0\\1&1&1\\1&-1&1\end{bmatrix}$ . For $n=4$ , we have $A_4:=\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0&0\\1&1&1&1\\1&2&0&0\\1&-1&1&-1\end{bmatrix}$ and for $n=5$ it is $A_5:=\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0&0&0\\1&1&1&1&1\\1&2&-1&-2&1\\1&-2&-1&2&1\\1&-1&1&-1&1\end{bmatrix}$ . If the inverse of $A_n$ exists, it gives us the conversion matrix. In the case $n=3$ we have $A_3^{-1}=\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0\\0&-1&1\\-1&-1&-1\end{bmatrix}$ . Consider for example the function $0\mapsto 1,1\mapsto 2, 2\mapsto 0$ . We compute $\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0\\0&-1&1\\-1&-1&-1\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}1\\2\\0\end{bmatrix}\equiv\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\\0\end{bmatrix}$ so our desired polynomial is $x^0+x^1$ . Indeed, this evaluates correctly mod 3. For $n$ prime, this matrix seems to always be invertible (at least up to 11 according to wolfram). Moreover, the leftmost column of the inverse matrix is always $\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\\\vdots\\0\\-1\end{bmatrix}$ so the indicator $i_0(x)$ is the polynomial $1-x^{p-1}$ . This corresponds to the corollary of Fermat's Theorem that $p\not\mid x\Rightarrow x^{p-1}\equiv 1$ . Also, the bottom row of the inverse matrix always seems to be $\begin{bmatrix}-1&-1&\cdots&-1&-1\end{bmatrix}$ . I have not been able to prove that $A_p$ is always invertible for $p$ prime. For $n$ composite the $A_n$ seems never to be invertible, though I haven't been able to prove this either. However a proof of this wouldn't even answer the original question. Fermat's Theorem doesn't hold for composites, so we might theoretically find a suitable polynomial of degree $\geq n$ . I am also wondering about potential applications of this idea. If the symmetric group $S_p$ can be represented using polynomials in this way, group multiplication would correspond to composition of the polynomials (mod $p$ ). For example, we would have that $S_3\cong \{x,x+1,x+2,2x,2x+1,2x+2\}$ . We don't typically think of $S_3$ as being linear polynomials (mod 3) under composition, but apparently (up to isomorphism) it is ! We could take this idea even further: for every $n$ , there's always a least prime $p\geq n$ so we could potentially pick an embedding $S_n\leq S_p$ . Then by Cayley's Theorem we could represent any finite group as composing polynomials (mod $p$ ) for some prime. Perhaps representing groups  this way would give new insights into group theory? I would also appreciate any other ideas for potential applications. Thank you!","Consider where . We can associate to a polynomial of degree by defining .

87,How are the values of a function expressed in the formal language of ZFC set theory?,How are the values of a function expressed in the formal language of ZFC set theory?,,"I'm curious as to how the values $f(x)$ of a function $f$ , which as defined, are the corresponding unique $y$ such that $(x,y)\in f$ , are expressed formally in the language of ZFC (or an extension thereof). For example, with the help of the extension by definitions scheme, one can construct conservative extensions of ZFC with additional function symbols such as the power set operation, union, ordered pairs and Cartesian products with their respective definitional axioms. In particular, after proving $$\forall x\exists !y\forall z(\forall w(w\in z\rightarrow w\in x)\leftrightarrow z\in y)$$ in ZFC, we can add a new function symbol $\mathcal P$ to the signature and an additional axiom $$\forall x\forall z(\forall w(w\in z\rightarrow w\in x)\leftrightarrow z\in\mathcal P(x))$$ characterizing the power set of $x$ . In this case, we can work out the value of $\mathcal P(x)$ to be the unique $y$ that satisfies the former sentence. Likewise, we can add predicate symbols to the signature; for instance, the formula "" $f$ is a function"" is equivalent to $$\forall x(x\in f\rightarrow\exists y\exists z(x=(y,z)))\land\forall x\forall y\forall z(((x,y)\in f\land (x,z)\in f)\rightarrow y=z)$$ assuming we have extended the theory to capture the notion of ordered pairs. Moreover, we can add a ternary predicate so that the formula $f:X\to Y$ has its intended meaning in our supertheory, in a similar fashion. The problem however occurs where we define the term $f(x)$ as the unique $y$ such that $(x,y)\in f$ . How is this done formally? Do we add a new function symbol $f$ as a means to extend our supertheory so that $f(x)$ becomes a term? That can't be the case since $f$ would otherwise be undefined for most of the domain of discourse contrary to the behavior of function symbols in the signature such as $\mathcal P$ . Sure, the notation for $f(x)=y$ can be dismissed as an abbreviation for $(x,y)\in f$ , but there are formulas that treat the notation differently where $f(x)$ is treated as a legitimate term, such as the formal statement of AC : $$\forall X(X\ne\emptyset\rightarrow\exists f(f:X\to\bigcup X\land\forall A(A\in X\rightarrow f(A)\in A)))$$ which just can't be a well-formed formula unless $f$ is a function symbol.

I need some verification for how these kinds of proofs of non-uniform continuity works.","f(x)=\frac{1}{x} (0,1) (0,1) \forall \epsilon > 0 \ \exists \delta > 0 \ \forall x,y \in (0,1) \ : \ |x-y|<\delta \implies |\frac{1}{x}-\frac{1}{y}|<\epsilon. \epsilon=\frac{1}{2} x=\frac{1}{n} y=\frac{1}{n+1} n \in \mathbb{N} \delta |\frac{1}{n}-\frac{1}{n+1}|<\delta 1<\frac{1}{2} (0,1) x=\frac{1}{3} y=\frac{1}{2} \delta |\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{2}|<\delta 1<\frac{1}{2} \delta x,y \delta |\frac{1}{n}-\frac{1}{n+1}|<\delta x,y n x,y","['functions', 'continuity', 'epsilon-delta', 'uniform-continuity']"
98,Proving the uniqueness of a solution to $f(x-f(y)) = f(f(y)) + xf(y) + f(x) - 1$ [duplicate],Proving the uniqueness of a solution to  [duplicate],f(x-f(y)) = f(f(y)) + xf(y) + f(x) - 1,"This question already has an answer here : Let $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ satisfy $f\big(x-f(y)\big)=f\big(f(y)\big)+x\cdot f(y)+f(x)-1$ for all $x,y\in\mathbb{R}$. (1 answer) Closed 4 years ago . Determine all functions $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} $ satisfying $f(x-f(y)) = f(f(y)) + xf(y) + f(x) - 1$ I have solved this by doing the  substitution $x \rightarrow 2f(y)$ and then replacing $x$ back. I get $f(x) = 1 -  \frac{x^2}{2}$ Now, I want to find all the other functions satisfying the equation or prove that this is the only solution. This is just like the question I have already asked, with the difference being that this functional equation has two variables alongwith some nested functions. From the approach in the answer to that question, I tried assuming another function $g$ satisfying the equation and then try to prove that $h = f - g$ is a constant function with value $0$ . But, I am unable to do that in this case. Also, there aren't many constraints on the function except it being from $\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} $ . How can I even approach the problem in this case? Are there any methods involving calculus?","This question already has an answer here : Let $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ satisfy $f\big(x-f(y)\big)=f\big(f(y)\big)+x\cdot f(y)+f(x)-1$ for all $x,y\in\mathbb{R}$.
