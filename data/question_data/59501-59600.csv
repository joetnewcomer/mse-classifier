3,Use of Mellin transform for evaluation of a series,Use of Mellin transform for evaluation of a series,,"Show that $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\sin an}{n}=\frac{\pi-a}{2} \ , \ 0<a<2\pi$$ I was asked to use Mellin transform to prove this result. So I used a formula related to the general series as follows $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty f(nx)=\mathcal{M}^{-1}\{F(s)\zeta(s);x\}$$ where $F(s)=\mathcal{M}\{f(x);s\}$ and $\zeta(s)$ is Riemann zeta function. Now taking $f(n)=\displaystyle\frac{\sin an}{n}$ we have $\displaystyle\mathcal{M}\bigg(\frac{\sin ax}{x}\bigg)=-\frac{\Gamma(s-1)\cos \frac{s\pi}{2}}{a^{s-1}}$ . Combining everything and using the  formula that $$\pi^s\zeta(1-s)=2^{1-s}\Gamma(s)\zeta(s)\cos \frac{s\pi}{2}$$ we have $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\sin an}{n}=-\frac{a}{2}\mathcal{M}^{-1}\bigg\{\bigg(\frac{2\pi}{a}\bigg)^s\frac{\zeta(1-s)}{s-1};x=1\bigg\}$$ Now if we use calculus of residues to evaluate the expression at RHS, we see that we have singularity at $s=1$ . Using $\zeta(0)=-\frac{1}{2}$ we can easily calculate the residue at $s=1$ , which is $\displaystyle-\frac{\pi}{a}$ .  So I get the answer $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\sin an}{n}=-\frac{a}{2}.\bigg(-\frac{\pi}{a}\bigg)=\frac{\pi}{2}$$ which is wrong of course as there should be an extra term $-\displaystyle\frac{a}{2}$ on RHS.

12,Does the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\cos(n+x)}{n}$ converge uniformly?,Does the series  converge uniformly?,\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\cos(n+x)}{n},"Does the following series $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\cos(n+x)}{n}$$ converge uniformly? I know the series converges pointwise since $\sum_{n}\frac{\cos n}{n}$ and $\sum_{n}\frac{\sin n}{n}$ converge. From desmos, it seems the series converges to some sort of sine wave and is infinitely differentiable. I have tried rewriting the series into $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\cos n\cos x - \sin n\sin x}{n}$$ in order to use the Weierstrass M-Test. However, I'm not sure how to get a sequence of constants $C_{n}$ such that $$\sup_{x\in\mathbb{R}}\left|\frac{\cos n\cos x - \sin n\sin x}{n}\right|\leq C_{n}$$ and where $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}C_{n}$ converges. I tried using the triangle inequality but this gives me something like $$\frac{|\cos n| + |\sin n|}{n}$$ This doesn't appear to help because it negates cancellation of positive and negative terms so my intuition tells me $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{|\cos n| + |\sin n|}{n}$ would diverge as the harmonic series diverges.

You can see this definition and the properties of this arithmetic function from the Wikipedia Radical of an integer . Then I wondered about a variant of two problems showed in last paragraphs of section B 41 of Guy's book [1]. Definition. For each fixed integer $n\geq 1$, I consider the arithmetic function $$f(n)=f^1(n):=\operatorname{rad}(n)+1,\tag{1}$$ and we create the iterated $$f^{k+1}=f(f^{k}(n))\tag{2}$$ until $f^{T}(n)$ reaches a prime number, here thus $T=T(n)$ is a function depending on $n$ (that is the number of steps in our iteration that we need to wait until the sequence of iterated $f^{k}(n)$ reaches a prime number  for the first time). We can call stopping time to the arithmetic function $T(n)$ (defined thus for integers $n\geq 1$ and taking positive values). Example 1. Let $n=1$, then in a step the sequence of iterations reaches a prime number since $f(1)=f^1(1)=\operatorname{rad}(1)+1=1+1=2$ is a prime number. The same argument works with the composite number $n=8$, because $f(8)=f^1(8)=\operatorname{rad}(8)+1=2+1=3$ a prime number. Thus in our table $T(1)=1$ iteration, and also in this example we've seen that the corresponding  sequence defined for the integer $8$ has stopping time $T(8)=1$. Example 2. We work about the calculation of $T(33)$. We iterate while the result is a composite integer. Here $\operatorname{rad}(33)=33$, thus $f(33)=34$ and since $34=2\cdot 17$ is also square-free then $f^2(33)=f(f(33))=34+1=35$. Again our last iterated, that is $35=5\cdot 7$ has no repeated prime factors, thus we write $f^3(33)=f(35)=36$. Finally $f^4(33)=\operatorname{rad}(36)+1=6+1=7$ that results a prime number. Thus we conclude that $T(33)=4$. Computational fact. I did few experiments/calculations and seems that the arithmetic function $T(n)$ is erratic, thus it makes sense to study averages of consecutive values of this stopping time. Question. I would like to know if it is possible to deduce a tighter upper bound for $$\frac{1}{N}\sum_{1\leq n\leq N}T(n)\tag{3}$$   as $N$ grows (if you are able to provide an elaborated statement about the asymptotic behaviour of $(3)$ as $N\to\infty$ feel free to do it). Many thanks. Final remarks. My motivation was to propose a similar variant of the mentioned problems in Guy's book, now for other interesting arithmetic function $\operatorname{rad}(n)$. I've no idea about a strategy to attack the problem to get idea about the size of the average means of the $T(n)$. References: [1]  Richard K.

You can see this definition and the properties of this arithmetic function from the Wikipedia Radical of an integer . Then I wondered about a variant of two problems showed in last paragraphs of section B 41 of Guy's book [1]. Definition. For each fixed integer $n\geq 1$, I consider the arithmetic function $$f(n)=f^1(n):=\operatorname{rad}(n)+1,\tag{1}$$ and we create the iterated $$f^{k+1}=f(f^{k}(n))\tag{2}$$ until $f^{T}(n)$ reaches a prime number, here thus $T=T(n)$ is a function depending on $n$ (that is the number of steps in our iteration that we need to wait until the sequence of iterated $f^{k}(n)$ reaches a prime number  for the first time). We can call stopping time to the arithmetic function $T(n)$ (defined thus for integers $n\geq 1$ and taking positive values). Example 1. Let $n=1$, then in a step the sequence of iterations reaches a prime number since $f(1)=f^1(1)=\operatorname{rad}(1)+1=1+1=2$ is a prime number. The same argument works with the composite number $n=8$, because $f(8)=f^1(8)=\operatorname{rad}(8)+1=2+1=3$ a prime number. Thus in our table $T(1)=1$ iteration, and also in this example we've seen that the corresponding  sequence defined for the integer $8$ has stopping time $T(8)=1$. Example 2. We work about the calculation of $T(33)$. We iterate while the result is a composite integer. Here $\operatorname{rad}(33)=33$, thus $f(33)=34$ and since $34=2\cdot 17$ is also square-free then $f^2(33)=f(f(33))=34+1=35$. Again our last iterated, that is $35=5\cdot 7$ has no repeated prime factors, thus we write $f^3(33)=f(35)=36$. Finally $f^4(33)=\operatorname{rad}(36)+1=6+1=7$ that results a prime number. Thus we conclude that $T(33)=4$. Computational fact. I did few experiments/calculations and seems that the arithmetic function $T(n)$ is erratic, thus it makes sense to study averages of consecutive values of this stopping time. Question. I would like to know if it is possible to deduce a tighter upper bound for $$\frac{1}{N}\sum_{1\leq n\leq N}T(n)\tag{3}$$   as $N$ grows (if you are able to provide an elaborated statement about the asymptotic behaviour of $(3)$ as $N\to\infty$ feel free to do it). Many thanks. Final remarks. My motivation was to propose a similar variant of the mentioned problems in Guy's book, now for other interesting arithmetic function $\operatorname{rad}(n)$. I've no idea about a strategy to attack the problem to get idea about the size of the average means of the $T(n)$. References: [1]  Richard K.
