1,Finding roots and factors of multivariate polynomials,Finding roots and factors of multivariate polynomials,,"I know that in order to factor a one dimensional polynomial one can find the roots with some method, for instance a numerical newton method.

6,Solving laplace's equation for an inviscid and incompresible fluid,Solving laplace's equation for an inviscid and incompresible fluid,,"Background I'm working on a 2D inviscid, incompressible fluid sim using vortex methods (that is, treating vortex as discrete particles), and I'm trying to (numerically) solve the no-through boundary conditions, which simply say that the fluid isn't allowed to pass through boundaries of the fluid (which means either the walls of its container or bodies floating in the fluid).  A couple of different sources I have suggest one way of doing it: construct a scalar field such that its gradient stops the fluid flow at the boundaries.  ie: $$\nabla \Phi \cdot \mathbf{n} = (\mathbf{u_b} - \mathbf{u_\omega}) \cdot \mathbf{n}$$ where $\Phi$ is the scalar field I need to find, $\mathbf{u_\omega}$ is the velocity field of the fluid without the boundary conditions, $\mathbf{u_b}$ is the velocity of the boundary itself, and $\mathbf{n}$ is the normalized surface normal of the boundary. Because the flow is incompressible, $\Delta \Phi = 0$ (ie: Laplace's equation).  A source I have (""Vortex Methods, Theory and Practice"") says you can solve this using a superposition of Green's functions.  This looks like: $$\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \mathbf{n}}(\mathbf{x_b}) = \pm \frac{1}{2} \sigma(\mathbf{x_b}) + \int_S{[\sigma(\mathbf{x_b'}) G(\mathbf{x_b} - \mathbf{x_b'}) -\mu(\mathbf{x_b'}) \mathbf{n} \cdot \nabla G(\mathbf{x_b} - \mathbf{x_b'})] dS(\mathbf{x_b'})}$$ where $\mathbf{x_b}$ is a point on the boundary, $G(\mathbf{x_b} - \mathbf{x_b'})$ is Green's function, and in 2D is $-\frac{\log(|\mathbf{x_b} - \mathbf{x_b'}|)}{2 \pi}$, and $S$ is the boundary I'm trying to prevent the fluid from going through (ie: in 2D it's a polygon's border).  Also: $$\mu = \Phi_e - \Phi_i$$ That is, it's the difference in the potential ($\Phi$) on opposite sides of the boundary.  The book refers to this as the ""double-layer potential"".  And: $$\sigma = \frac{\partial \Phi_e}{\partial \mathbf{n}} - \frac{\partial \Phi_i}{\partial \mathbf{n}} $$ The book refers to this as the single-layer potential or ""source"". Then the book assumes that the potential is continuous, so we can say that $\mu = 0$.  A large term in the integral above cancels, and we're finally left with: Final equation $$(\mathbf{u_b} - \mathbf{u_\omega}) \cdot \mathbf{n}(\mathbf{x_b}) = -\frac{1}{2} \sigma(\mathbf{x_b}) + \int_S{\sigma(\mathbf{x_b'}) G(\mathbf{x_b} - \mathbf{x_b'}) dS(\mathbf{x_b'})}$$ Questions First, if anyone has any background in fluids or potential, is the above description correct?  This isn't math I was ever formally taught and I'm just kind of piecing it together as I go. Also if I understand correctly, in order to actually solve this I need to ""discretize"" this integral to turn it in to a system of algebraic equations, form a big matrix, and solve it for the $\sigma$ terms.  One simple way of doing this would be to simply select $n$ evenly spaced points along the border of the polygon (is that right?). However, I don't understand what the $\sigma$ term actually is.  In the definition it looks like it's the Jacobian of $\Phi$ with respect to the normal, which would make it a row vector.  But in the above final equation, it seems to be treating it as a scalar term. Also, once I have the $\sigma$ terms, what do I actually do with them?  Ultimately I want to calculate $\nabla \Phi (\mathbf{x})$ for some arbitrary point in space $\mathbf{x}$, but I don't see how to do that once you have the $\sigma$ terms. I found an article on the double-layer potential with math that looks very familiar, so I'm guessing this is a well understood problem, but I'm certainly not understanding it :).

These two gradients are related by the expression: $$S=G+G^{T}-I \circ G $$ and it turns out that the first-order differential of the function $f$ at a given point $X$ after a perturbation $\Delta X$ can be computed as: $$ d f=\sum_{i, j} G_{i j} d X_{i j} = \sum_{i \geq j} S_{i j} d X_{i j}$$ It is important however to note how, in an iterative algorithm that updates a variable $X^{k+1}$ (such as in gradient descent), we have to use the constrained gradient $S$ and not the gradient $G$ , due to the fact that $X$ is symmetric while the gradient $G$ could be not symmetric.

These two gradients are related by the expression: and it turns out that the first-order differential of the function at a given point after a perturbation can be computed as: It is important however to note how, in an iterative algorithm that updates a variable (such as in gradient descent), we have to use the constrained gradient and not the gradient , due to the fact that is symmetric while the gradient could be not symmetric. More information can be found in the above links, that explain the relation also in terms of and operators. Coming to my question. I want now to find the Hessian of the function , that in theory is a th order tensor and we already know the mangy road crisscrossed to get to the gradient. To start, is it correct to perturb the first-order differential (with the unconstrained gradient)? If yes, I will reach a scalar quadratic form. For instance, if we consider as function , we know that the second order approximation with perturbation in and is given by (and I reference this question Second order approximation of log det X ): We can arrive at the Hessian in matrix form .

39,"Geometric meaning of interior,exterior derivatives, and, Hodge Duality","Geometric meaning of interior,exterior derivatives, and, Hodge Duality",,"I've been tinkering with differential forms for a while now, and I've had a few questions all rolled into one trying to understand them. The exterior derivative is quite natural to me - it looks just like a regular old derivative, and so I believe I have a good intuition about how it works. The first question that struck me was that I did not have a similar intuition about the interior derivative. I wanted to know in what sense it was a derivative, if any, and either way I wanted to get an idea of what this guy really does. A geometric interpretation would have been ideal. At one point I was thinking about tensor contractions and how that's kind of like a trace, but that's not really what the interior derivative is anyway, so I ended up putting that aside for a while. But I noticed something interesting that has given me renewed interest in the question when I learned about Hodge duality. We will work in $\mathbb R^3$ with the usual coordinates. Consider an arbitrary $1-$ form which we'll write down as $F_x dx + F_y dy + F_z dz$ . We'll compute the exterior derivative of this, and we end up with $$ \bigg ( \frac{\partial F_x}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial F_y}{\partial x} \bigg ) dx \wedge dy + \bigg ( \frac{\partial F_x}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial F_z}{\partial x} \bigg ) dz \wedge dx + \bigg ( \frac{\partial F_y}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial F_z}{\partial y} \bigg ) dy \wedge dz $$ Amazingly (at least to me), this is the Hodge dual of the curl! Now, we can do a similar computation using $d(i_X)$ . If we let $X = \alpha \frac{\partial }{\partial x} + \beta \frac{\partial}{\partial y} + \gamma \frac{\partial}{\partial z}$ . $X$ is a vector field so these could be functions of $x,y,z$ , it doesn't really matter. Now if we let $\omega$ denote the $3-$ form, $dx \wedge dy \wedge dz$ . We can now compute. The computation is a little laborious to do directly from the definition, but there's a nice little formula which we can use to shortcut the computation. What we end up with is $$ \alpha dy \wedge dz + \beta dz\wedge dx + \gamma dy \wedge dz$$ after a few little rearrangements. Now we take the exterior derivative of this, and we have $$\bigg (\frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial \beta}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial \gamma}{\partial z} \bigg ) (dx \wedge dy \wedge dz) $$ And again in a way that totally amazes me, this is Hodge dual of the divergence of $X$ ! Now this motivates the question: What is the geometric significance Hodge duality? If there was some nice way to think about what the Hodge dual of something is, it would help me to understand the interior derivative, maybe. There is a problem though, which makes me worry that all of this is just coincedence of some sort - the above analysis depends on the fact that the Hodge dual on a 3-manifold takes 1-forms to 2-forms, which is how we able to see what's going on with the curl. In particular, curl is not even defined in dimensions different from 3. Divergence is defined in general though, so that much is a welcome sign. So somehow, I want to say that what I have learned will give me an avenue to understanding interior derivatives, and exterior derivatives better, but I don't know how to interpret Hodge duality, and I have these concerns.

41,Question about Definition of Boundary in Stokes' Theorem,Question about Definition of Boundary in Stokes' Theorem,,"I was wondering if what my teacher said was correct and complete in that in Stokes' Theorem the ""boundary curve"" of a surface can be defined as the mapping along the boundary of the two-dimensional region from which the surface is parameterized. For example, if a surface $\mathbf r(u,v)$ is a mapping from the u-v plane to x-y-z space, then the boundary of $\mathbf r(u,v)$ is the curve that you get from mapping from the u-v plane to x-y-z along the boundary of the domain region in the u-v plane. Thanks in advance! Edit: I was discussing with my teacher and we think the above is the case (although I would really like someone to please confirm) but interestingly depending on how you parameterize a surface you may get similar but not exactly the same results for the boundary curve by following the above method, although you do get equivalent results if you account for direction, and the same answer via two parametrization makes me think I'm on the right track. To demonstrate what I mean let me use an example. Call the surface S the part of the sphere $x^2+y^2+z^2=4$ above the plane $z=1$. The boundary curve is obviously the intersection of the plane and the sphere, that is the circle $x^2+y^2=3$ (and $z=1$). It seems from the fact that we can get this result using the method that traces the out the boundary curve by mapping to the surface along the domain using two different parametrizations that this definition of a boundary curve is correct (though note that the spherical one requires that two parts cancel each other out). Example: Cartesian Coordinates We can write the surface S as $\mathbf r(x,y)= \big<x,y,\sqrt{4-x^2-y^2}\big>$ (where we take the positive root since $z\geq1 \rightarrow z\geq0$). Now, the surfaces is a mapping of  all $(x,y)$ from the ""filled-in circle"" $x^2+y^2\leq3$ to it via $z=\sqrt{4-x^2-y^2}$, so tracing along the boundary of the planar domain region $x^2+y^2\leq3$, that is, $x^2+y^2=3$, and mapping to the surface gives the boundary curve $x^2+y^2=3$ with $z=1$ (the first part of which is given by the fact that the domain of the curve we are tracing along the surface is $x^2+y^2=3$ and the $z=1$ part we got from plugging in). Now in spherical coordinates we get a similar result for the boundary curve. Spherical Coordinates We can write S as $\mathbf r(\phi,\theta) = \big<2\sin\phi\cos\theta,2\sin\phi\sin\theta,2\cos\phi\big> $ where $0\leq\theta\leq2\pi$ and $0\leq\phi\leq\frac{\pi}{3}$. This gives us a rectangular domain in the ""$\phi$-$\theta$"" plane (where $\phi$ is where the x-axis would be and $\theta$ where the y-axis would be and the surface is a mapping from the rectangle into x-y-z space) bounded by the coordinate axis and the lines $\theta = 2\pi$ and $\phi=\frac{\pi}{3}$. Update: Here's an image: Going along the bottom ($\theta =0, \phi$ varying to $\frac{\pi}{3}$) gives us a downward arch along the sphere from the top to the bounding circle. Similarly, going along the right gives us the bounding circle, going along the top gives the arch but in the opposite direction (so they cancel -- I presume) and at $\phi=0$ moving down the last side of the rectangle (where $\theta$ is varying from $2\pi$ back to $0$) all we get is a point which doesn't contribute to the curve leaving us with the same boundary curve to S. To recap, as we map to the surface alone the boundary of the domain, we go from the ""north pole"", down a longitude to the 60-degree latitude, around the latitude 360 degrees and back up the same longitude to the north pole, gibing us the boundary circle.

50,All smooth real functions are related by coordinate change?,All smooth real functions are related by coordinate change?,,"Suppose you have two smooth functions $F,G:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ with the property that none of the partial derivatives vanish anywhere.  I wonder if it's possible to find functions  $P:\mathbb{R}^n\leftrightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ and $Q:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that $$G = Q\circ F\circ P.$$ I feel like it should be possible, using Jacobians or something as a change of coordinates, but I'm not sure how to begin or if I need further restrictions. If this result is true, it would imply that in some sense all real functions of this form with non-vanishing partial derivatives are equivalent through a kind of change of coordinates. Here's a solution for a special case. If the dimension is $n=1$, then $F$ and $G$ are smooth monotone functions and are therefore invertible. Let $P$ be the identity function, and let $Q=G\circ F^{-1}$. Of course, if $F$ is not also surjective, then $Q$ is not well-defined everywhere; perhaps it is possible to extend $Q$ to all of $\mathbb{R}$, though I'm not sure how smoothly. And if the dimension $n>1$, then here is a sketch of what I think shows the result: Intuitively, there ought to be (integral?) curves $\gamma_1,\gamma_2:\mathbb{R}^1\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ through the domains of $F$ and $G$ such that $F\circ \gamma_1$ is a monotonic function passing through all possible values of $F$, and similarly for $G$. These curves define a fixed transformation between the codomains of $F$ and $G$, by $Q\equiv (G\circ \gamma_2) \circ (F\circ \gamma_1)^{-1}$. Intuitively, it should be possible to parametrize the graphs of $F$ and $G$ using $n$ coordinates, where the first coordinate tells you the level and the remaining coordinates uniquely specify a point in the domain with that level. Because of the conditions on $F$ and $G$, I expect these can be expressed as smooth functions $\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$. In another way of looking at it, there should be smooth functions $T_1, T_2 : \mathbb{R}^{n-1} \times \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ which carry points in $\mathbb{R}^n$ smoothly and invertibly through all other points in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with the same $F$ (respectively $G$) level. We think of the second argument as being the point $x$, and the first argument as being a ""displacement"" within the level surface at $F(x)$. (I am a little concerned about level sets shaped like $n$-spheres, in which case this construction doesn't work invertibly— but perhaps such level sets are not possible if $F$, $G$ have everywhere nonzero partials. In that case, the level sets will be sort of $\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$-shaped, always.) By combining the flow functions $T_i$ and the canonical curves $\gamma_i$, we obtain functions $H_i \equiv T_i(s, \gamma_i(t))$ which send $\mathbb{R}^{n-1} \times \mathbb{R}$ smoothly into all of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Intuitively, there should be a smooth isomorphism $P:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ which sends the level sets of $G$ to the level sets of $F$. In particular, we should be able to pick one which sends the canonical points $\gamma_2(\mathbb{R})$ to the canonical points $\gamma_1(\mathbb{R})$ so that $P\circ \gamma_2 = \gamma_1$. We can do so concretely by defining $P(x) = H_1\circ H_2^{-1}$ Hence our solution is to use $Q\equiv (G\circ \gamma_2) \circ (F\circ \gamma_1)^{-1}$, sending levels of $F$ monotonically to levels of $G$, and $P\equiv H_1\circ H_2^{-1}$, sending level sets of $G$ to level sets of $F$ in a monotonic-like way. (specifically, if $G(x) < G(y)$, then $F\circ P(x) < F\circ P(y)$ or something like that). (Here, $H_2^{-1}$ looks up the unique way of expressing point $x$ as ""distance"" traveled along a $G$-level curve from some canonical other point with the same $G$-level. The result is a flow amount $s$; $H_1$ looks up the point with the same $F$-level as $x$ and applies the flow amount $s$ to it, resulting in a uniquely defined new point $x^\prime$, with certain special properties.) Does this kind of construction work? I think if $n>1$ then we can construct $H_i$ as follows: because the partials of $F$ and $G$ don't vanish, we should be able to find unit vector fields $\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ which are smooth and perpendicular to the gradients of $F$ and $G$, respectively; then the flow functions $H_i$ can simply translate along the integral surfaces of these vector fields.  I think the only obstacle I see is if the integral surfaces are of incompatible shape— for example, if one is a line and the other a circle. But maybe the level surfaces can't be things like circles, because then the functions $F$ and $G$ wouldn't have everywhere nonvanishing partials (?). Here's a concrete example of this construction for if $F$ is the sum function and $G$ is the multiplication function (ignoring the fact that $G$'s level sets have many branches): We can pick canonical curves $\gamma_1(t) = \langle \vec{0}, t \rangle$ and $\gamma_2(t) = \langle \vec{1}, t\rangle$ so that $F\circ \gamma_1$ and $G\circ \gamma_2$ pass through all possible values. These curves define the level-transforming function $Q \equiv (G\circ \gamma_2) \circ (F \circ \gamma_{1})^{-1}$; in this case, you can find that $Q$ is just the identity. We can pick flow functions to send points to all other points on the same level surface : $T_1(s,x) = x + \bar{s}$, where $\bar{s} \equiv \langle s_1, \ldots, s_{n-1}, \sum_i s_i\rangle$. $T_2(s, x) \equiv x \cdot \bar{s}$, where $\bar{s} \equiv \langle e^{s_1}, \ldots, e^{s_{n-1}}, e^{\sum_i s_i}\rangle.$ In combination with the canonical curves $\gamma_i$, these flow functions give us $H_i(s,t) = T_i(s, \gamma_i(t))$. Here, $H_1(s,t) = \langle \vec{s}, t - \sum_i s_i\rangle$ and $H_2(s,t) = \langle e^\vec{s}, t\cdot e^{-\sum_i s_i} \rangle$. Hence we define $P \equiv H_1 \circ H_{2}^{-1}$. To be clear, $H_2^{-1}(y) = \langle \log{y_1}, \ldots, \log{y_{n-1}}, \prod_i y_i \rangle$. In which case, $$P(x_1,\ldots, x_n) = \langle \log{x_1}, \ldots, \log{x_{n-1}}, \prod_i x_i - \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \log{x_i}\rangle$$ And we find that $Q\circ F \circ P = F \circ P = \prod_i x_i = G$ (if you add up all the entries in $P$, the log terms all cancel and you're left with the product.) There are of course other $P$ and $Q$ with this same effect; it all depends on the choice of canonical curve $\gamma_1, \gamma_2$, for instance.","Suppose you have two smooth functions $F,G:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ with the property that none of the partial derivatives vanish anywhere.

(Here, $H_2^{-1}$ looks up the unique way of expressing point $x$ as ""distance"" traveled along a $G$-level curve from some canonical other point with the same $G$-level. The result is a flow amount $s$; $H_1$ looks up the point with the same $F$-level as $x$ and applies the flow amount $s$ to it, resulting in a uniquely defined new point $x^\prime$, with certain special properties.) Does this kind of construction work? I think if $n>1$ then we can construct $H_i$ as follows: because the partials of $F$ and $G$ don't vanish, we should be able to find unit vector fields $\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ which are smooth and perpendicular to the gradients of $F$ and $G$, respectively; then the flow functions $H_i$ can simply translate along the integral surfaces of these vector fields.  I think the only obstacle I see is if the integral surfaces are of incompatible shape— for example, if one is a line and the other a circle. But maybe the level surfaces can't be things like circles, because then the functions $F$ and $G$ wouldn't have everywhere nonvanishing partials (?). Here's a concrete example of this construction for if $F$ is the sum function and $G$ is the multiplication function (ignoring the fact that $G$'s level sets have many branches): We can pick canonical curves $\gamma_1(t) = \langle \vec{0}, t \rangle$ and $\gamma_2(t) = \langle \vec{1}, t\rangle$ so that $F\circ \gamma_1$ and $G\circ \gamma_2$ pass through all possible values. These curves define the level-transforming function $Q \equiv (G\circ \gamma_2) \circ (F \circ \gamma_{1})^{-1}$; in this case, you can find that $Q$ is just the identity. We can pick flow functions to send points to all other points on the same level surface : $T_1(s,x) = x + \bar{s}$, where $\bar{s} \equiv \langle s_1, \ldots, s_{n-1}, \sum_i s_i\rangle$. $T_2(s, x) \equiv x \cdot \bar{s}$, where $\bar{s} \equiv \langle e^{s_1}, \ldots, e^{s_{n-1}}, e^{\sum_i s_i}\rangle.$ In combination with the canonical curves $\gamma_i$, these flow functions give us $H_i(s,t) = T_i(s, \gamma_i(t))$. Here, $H_1(s,t) = \langle \vec{s}, t - \sum_i s_i\rangle$ and $H_2(s,t) = \langle e^\vec{s}, t\cdot e^{-\sum_i s_i} \rangle$. Hence we define $P \equiv H_1 \circ H_{2}^{-1}$. To be clear, $H_2^{-1}(y) = \langle \log{y_1}, \ldots, \log{y_{n-1}}, \prod_i y_i \rangle$. In which case, $$P(x_1,\ldots, x_n) = \langle \log{x_1}, \ldots, \log{x_{n-1}}, \prod_i x_i - \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \log{x_i}\rangle$$ And we find that $Q\circ F \circ P = F \circ P = \prod_i x_i = G$ (if you add up all the entries in $P$, the log terms all cancel and you're left with the product.) There are of course other $P$ and $Q$ with this same effect; it all depends on the choice of canonical curve $\gamma_1, \gamma_2$, for instance.",,"['multivariable-calculus', 'jacobian']"

Let $f:\mathbb{R} ^{2}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a function that satisfies $\left| f\left( x_{1},y_{1}\right) -f\left( x_{2},y_{2}\right) \right| \leq \left( x_{1}-x_{2}\right) ^{2}+\left( y_{1}-y_{2}\right) ^{2}$ for every $\left( x_{1},y_{1}\right) ,\left( x_{1},y_{1}\right) \in \mathbb{R} ^{2}$ . proof that $f$ is constant Before I go on with the proofs, I would even argue that in the first question, the word ""differentiable"" is superfluous because if we are given that $\nabla f\equiv 0$ , then it's clear that $f$ is differentiable because the partial derivatives are continuous (because they are $0$ everywhere, and what more continuous than the constant function $0$ ?), is this correct? I came up with the following proofs: Given $\nabla f\equiv 0$ this means that $f_{x}\equiv f_{y}\equiv 0$ , if we ""freeze"" $y$ to be $y_{0}$ and let $x$ vary then $f(x,y_{0})$ is constant as a result of lagrange's theorem because $f_{x}\equiv 0$ , if we did something similar on $x$ we get that $f(x_{0},y)$ is constant for every $y$ . thus for every $\left( x,y\right) \in \mathbb{R} ^{2}$ we get that $f\left( x,y\right) =f\left( 0,y\right) =f\left( 0,0\right) $ (since it is constant if we move parallel to the axis) meaning $f$ is constant.

My first instinct was to set $u=xy$, so that my two equations for $u$ become $u=1$, and $u=4$. However, I wasn't sure about what my substitution for $v$ should be, so I eventually set it to $v=x$. In my transformation $uv$-space, I then had the curves $v=\sqrt{u}$ and $v=\sqrt{\frac{u}{2}}$ (the positive components, so my space looked like this (sorry, I can't post images yet): Transformed space From there, I calculated the Jacobian to be: $$\frac{\partial (u,v)}{\partial (x,y)} = v$$ Therefore, the inverse Jacobian (the one I want), was $\frac{1}{v}$. I could then set the integral up as the following: $$\int_{1}^{4} \int_{\sqrt{\frac{u}{2}}}^{\sqrt{u}} \frac{1}{v} \,dv \,du$$ This is indeed the correct answer, but when I look at the solution, my professor provided, he used the substitutions $u=xy$ and $v=\frac{y}{x}$. The transformed space he created is then a simple rectangle, which is simpler to integrate. It looked like this: $$\int_{1}^{4} \int_{1}^{2} \frac{1}{2v} \,dv \,du$$ In the end, both approaches worked (as they should), but I was wondering if there were some general guidelines or suggestions that could be given when choosing what substitution should be used?

Let $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^p$ be continuously differentiable in an open set containing $a$, where $p \leq n$. If $f(a) = 0$ and the $p \times n$ matrix $(D_jf^i(a))$ has rank $p$, then there is an open set $A \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ containing $a$ and a differentiable function $h: A \to \mathbb{R}^n$ with differentiable inverse such that    $$f \circ h(x^1, \ldots, x^n) = (x^{n-p+1}, \ldots, x^n).$$ It seems like the function $f(x) = x^2 - \frac{1}{4}$, around $a = -\frac{1}{2}$, serves as a counterexample. Obviously this function is continuously differentiable everywhere, and $f(a) = 0$, and the derivative $f'(x) = 2x$ is nonzero at $a$. Since the domain of $h$ is $A$ which contains $a$, there must be $h(a)$ such that $f(h(a)) = a$ by the statement of the theorem, i.e., $f(h(-\frac{1}{2})) = -\frac{1}{2}$, but this is impossible as $f$ attains its minimum at $(0, -\frac{1}{4})$.

The error is that ""the situation considered in the proof of Theorem 2-12"" establishes the existence of $h(x)$ where $x$ is in a neighbourhood of $(a^1, \ldots, a^{n-p}, 0, \ldots, 0)$ (by considering a function $F$ that replaces the last $p$ coordinates of $x$ by $f(x)$, then applying the inverse function theorem) rather than in a neighbourhood of $a$ itself. What is the correct statement of theorem 2-13?

Let $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^p$ be continuously differentiable in an open set containing $a$, where $p \leq n$. If $f(a) = 0$ and the $p \times n$ matrix $(D_jf^i(a))$ has rank $p$, then there is an open set $A \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ containing $a$ and a differentiable function $h: A \to \mathbb{R}^n$ with differentiable inverse such that    $$f \circ h(x^1, \ldots, x^n) = (x^{n-p+1}, \ldots, x^n).$$ It seems like the function $f(x) = x^2 - \frac{1}{4}$, around $a = -\frac{1}{2}$, serves as a counterexample. Obviously this function is continuously differentiable everywhere, and $f(a) = 0$, and the derivative $f'(x) = 2x$ is nonzero at $a$. Since the domain of $h$ is $A$ which contains $a$, there must be $h(a)$ such that $f(h(a)) = a$ by the statement of the theorem, i.e., $f(h(-\frac{1}{2})) = -\frac{1}{2}$, but this is impossible as $f$ attains its minimum at $(0, -\frac{1}{4})$.

92,Why is gradient a vector?,Why is gradient a vector?,,"I've just moved on from single variable to multivariable calculus and having trouble understanding the gradient as I'm trying to draw a comparison b/w single and multivariable derivatives. Why is a gradient a vector? So, let's take this with an example that we have a scalar function with 2 inputs i.e $z= F(x,y) = x^2 - y^2$ . Now, I do understand that gradient is a vector of the partial derivative of $z$ (or $F(x,y)$ ). However, why do we need to write it as a vector? If we write it as a vector we are also assigning it a direction. And to me, this direction seems not intuitive as partial derivatives ( $\partial_x z, \partial_y z$ ) tell us the change in $z$ w.r.t to $x$ or $y$ ( $2x$ & $-2y$ in the example above). So, if we plug in some values of $x$ and $y$ (let's say 2 and 3) then we end up with 2 scalar values which would tell us the change in $z$ . So, in our example, that would be 4(w.r.t x) and -6 (w.r.t $y$ ). Using this we can get a net change in $z$ . And to take this forward, these scalar values could be multiplied with any other unit vector to get the directional derivative (or a net change in $z$ ). Just not sure why gradient is a vector with direction? Also, the proof (dot product yields maximum value when 2 vectors point the same direction) for gradient being the steepest descent/ascent seems to be dependent on this fact (gradient as a vector).
