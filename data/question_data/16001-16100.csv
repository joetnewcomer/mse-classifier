9,"Acrobatic Calculus of ""Physicists"" in deriving the Taylor series for $e^x$","Acrobatic Calculus of ""Physicists"" in deriving the Taylor series for",e^x,"While looking for mathematics videos, I stumbled upon this video , dubbed ""S-Tier Acrobatic Calculus that Physicists do"" of which I was pleasantly surprised by what is presented in the video. The video center around the derivation of the Taylor's expansion for $e^x$ , of which we have the general form as $${\displaystyle e^{x}=1+x+{\frac {x^{2}}{2!}}+{\frac {x^{3}}{3!}}+{\frac {x^{4}}{4!}}+\cdots =\sum^{\infty}_{i=0} \frac{x^i}{i!}}$$ Here's how the video proceed to come up with the result (in a pretty carefree tone): Let's say that I forgot the Taylor's expansion of $e^x$ , but I remember that it is the only function whose derivative ${e^{x} }'$ and integral $\int e^x$ are both itself. Let's start with the integration form: $$e^x = \int e^x \: dx$$ as someone who is really good at calculus, I don't care about the lower bound of upper bound. In fact, I don't care about the $dx$ , so let's remove it: $$e^x = \int e^x$$ Much better. Now I can move everything to the left: $$e^{x}-\int e^{x} = 0 $$ which I now have 1 minus integration sign, that is $$\left( 1-\int    \right) e^{x}=0$$ and I am also free to left multiply the inverse: $$e^{x}=\left( 1-\int  \right)^{-1}\cdot 0$$ Now, we notice that $$(1-x)^{-1}=\frac{1}{1-x}=1+x+x^{2}+x^{3}+\dots$$ This looks familiar, doesn't it? ""As someone with a physics background, I can't resist expanding anything that is expendable"", then for our case $$\frac{1}{1-\int   } = 1 + \left( \int \right) + \left(\int\right)^{2}+\left(\int \right)^{3}+\dots$$ This looks very promising. Let's start the calculation: $$e^{x}= \left(1+\int+\left(\int\right)^{2}+\left(\int\right)^{3}+\dots\right)\cdot 0$$ The first term is zero. But the second term? Is it also zero? No, because we don't have $dx$ . That means it is not the normal integral that takes zero as intergrand, it is the operation integral $$\int \left( 0  \right) $$ that applies on 0. So what's the result? It is easier to think from the opposite side. Its derivative is 0, therefore it is a constant. As someone with a physics background, that constant must be 1: $$e^{x}=0 + 1+ \left(+\left(\int\right)^{2}+\left(\int\right)^{3}+\dots\right)\cdot 0$$ Similarly, I am looking for the value whose derivative is one: it's $x$ . Continuing this, for example value whose derivative is $x$ , I found that it is $\frac{x^{2}}{2!}$ . Then this chain of logic continues: $$e^{x}=0+1+x+{\frac {x^{2}}{2!}}+{\frac {x^{3}}{3!}}+{\frac {x^{4}}{4!}}+\cdots$$ which recovers the Taylor's expansion of $e^{x}$ . This seems to me, is between absurdity, but also logically reasonable. But what I found interesting is the remark of the OP: At the end of the video, I want to make some clarifications. With proper definition everything I have done so far is legitimate. Which is quite interesting considering which foundation and definitions would make this possible. I do not have adequate knowledge to be able to figure this out. I also read a person said that This actually has rigorous justifications if you work in an appropriate function space. For example, if you work in $L^{2}$ , the norm of the integral operator is less than one, so the expansion of the operator in the series is justified. In another person's words, he pointed it to operation theory, and the others about functional analysis and holomorphic functional calculus. However, I lack the knowledge to fully clarify these claims or explanation for myself.

Here are the parameters of my bezier curve: p1 = starting point p2 = ending point h1 = outer handle linked to p1 h2 = inner handle linked to p2 Since I have set the wave length at 1000 pixels to begin with, I know my p1 and p2: p1 = (0,0) p2 = (1000,0) Now, I need to find the coordinates of h1 and h2. But I don't know how to get there by calculation. By trial and error I get approximately this: h1 = (477,550) h2 = (523,-550) This is not perfect as no bezier would represent perfectly a sine curve but pretty close (see picture below). My question is: knowing my starting parameters (wave length in pixels, amplitude in pixels, p1 and p2 coordinates), how can I find mathematically h1 and h2? It seems that a bezier function with 4 coordinates (p1,h1,p2,h2) uses a cubic equation that should look like this: $$B(t) = (1-t)^3 . p1 + 3(1-t)^2.t.h1 + 3(1-t).t^2.h2+t^3.p2$$ I don't know what to do with this though since the wave length and the amplitude need to be accounted for so that h1 and h2 can be found. That said, I only need to find h1 since h2 will always have as its x value the wave length minus the x value of h1 ; and its y value will be the negative of the y value of h1 . Anyway, here is the visual result I came up with by trial and errors: The white graph is the Desmos Graph accurate rendering of a sin(x).

What does it mean?,,"I don't know what a coordinate system is , rigorously. (But I suspect they're related to bases of vector spaces under some map, where the basis can be the standard basis and the map can be the identity map.) On $\mathbb{R^2}$, I ""know"" that Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$ and polar coordinates $(r, \theta)$ are related by the functions: $r : (x,y) \mapsto \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ $\theta : (x,y) \mapsto \arctan(y/x)$. Now, Wikipedia says that polar coordinates are related to Cartesian coordinates via: $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ $\displaystyle d\theta = -{y\over r^2} dx\ +\ {x \over r^2}dy$. In particular, $d\theta$ looks suspiciously like a differential $1$-form, ie. a dual vector field, ie. a smooth section of the dual tangent bundle $T^* \mathbb{R^2}$ of $\mathbb{R^2}$, ie. a map that takes a point $(x,y)\in \mathbb{R^2}$ and outputs a dual tangent vector $\displaystyle -{y\over x^2 + y^2} dx\ +\ {x \over x^2 + y^2}dy$ expressed in terms of the dual standard basis $\{dx, dy\}$.

Also, $d\theta$ must be an exact form, being the image under $d$ of $\theta$ (I know this last statement is wrong, but why?). How does this talk of vectors relates to coordinate systems?

(But I suspect they're related to bases of vector spaces under some map, where the basis can be the standard basis and the map can be the identity map.) On $\mathbb{R^2}$, I ""know"" that Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$ and polar coordinates $(r, \theta)$ are related by the functions: $r : (x,y) \mapsto \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ $\theta : (x,y) \mapsto \arctan(y/x)$. Now, Wikipedia says that polar coordinates are related to Cartesian coordinates via: $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ $\displaystyle d\theta = -{y\over r^2} dx\ +\ {x \over r^2}dy$. In particular, $d\theta$ looks suspiciously like a differential $1$-form, ie. a dual vector field, ie. a smooth section of the dual tangent bundle $T^* \mathbb{R^2}$ of $\mathbb{R^2}$, ie. a map that takes a point $(x,y)\in \mathbb{R^2}$ and outputs a dual tangent vector $\displaystyle -{y\over x^2 + y^2} dx\ +\ {x \over x^2 + y^2}dy$ expressed in terms of the dual standard basis $\{dx, dy\}$. In terms of the de Rham complex of $\mathbb{R^2}$ $$\boldsymbol 0 \overset{d}{\longrightarrow} \Omega_0(\mathbb{R^2}) \overset{d}{\longrightarrow} \Omega_1(\mathbb{R^2}) \overset{d}{\longrightarrow} \Omega_2(\mathbb{R^2}) \overset{d}{\longrightarrow} \boldsymbol 0,$$ $d\theta$ seems to be an element of the vector space $\Omega_1(\mathbb{R^2})$. Also, $d\theta$ must be an exact form, being the image under $d$ of $\theta$ (I know this last statement is wrong, but why?). How does this talk of vectors relates to coordinate systems? Why can the relationship between coordinate systems be differential? What does this differential relationship mean, and how does it relate to the previously stated one? If coordinate systems can be differentiated, does it mean they are maps?

I quickly realized that its volume is actually finite, because to find the volume of revolution the function being integrated has to be squared, which would give 1/x^2, and, as we all know, that converges. So, my question is, are there other functions that share this property? The only family of functions that I know that satisfy this is 1/x, 2/x, 3/x, etc.","So I was thinking about the harmonic series, and how it diverges, even though every subsequent term tends toward zero.

97,Newton's method for square roots - digit precision (exercise from Cheney's Numerical Analysis),Newton's method for square roots - digit precision (exercise from Cheney's Numerical Analysis),,"I would greatly appreciate some help for this exercise in Kincaid and Cheney's Numerical Analysis : ""apply Newton's method to $f(x)=x^2-r$ (where $r>0$). Prove that if $x_n$ has $k$ correct digits after the decimal point, then $x_{n+1}$ has at least $2k-1$ correct digits, as long as $r>0.006$ and $k\geq 1$"". In general, if $f''$ is continuous and $r$ is a simple root of $f$ it holds that $e_{n+1}=x_{n+1}-\sqrt{r}=\frac{1}{2}\frac{f''(\xi_n)}{f'(x_n)}e_n^2$, where $\xi_n$ is some number between $x_n$ and $\sqrt{r}$. I suppose that the condition they're asking for is achieved (but I'm not sure) when  $e_{n+1}<e_n^2$. Applying the formula above gives $e_{n+1}=\frac{1}{2x_n}e_n^2<\frac{1}{2r}e_n^2$; this seems enough to find $r$. I don't know where the $0.006$ comes from. On the other hand, the textbook suggests to use $x_{n+1}=\frac{1}{2}(x_n+\frac{r}{x_n}).$ This expression can be transformed into one involving $e_{n+1}$ and $e_n$ but I don't know how to do it so that it would be more useful than the former bound.

98,How did Jacobi find his connection between theta functions and $q$?,How did Jacobi find his connection between theta functions and ?,q,"I was 'reading' (I can't actually read german, but I can read math!) Jacobi's derivation of the ODE for $y(q) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} q^{n^2} $ . On page 2 of the paper Jacobi states the following as an axiom of sorts that was considered to be obvious at the time. I am asking how to prove and see this result. The result is if $$ y(k) = \sqrt{ \frac{2}{\pi} \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{d\varphi}{\sqrt{1-k^2 \sin^2 (\varphi)}} }  $$ and $$ \ln \left( \frac{1}{q(k)} \right) = \pi \frac{ \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{d\varphi}{\sqrt{\cos^2(\varphi)+k^2 \sin^2(\varphi)}}}{ \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{d\varphi}{\sqrt{1-k^2 \sin^2(\varphi)}}} $$ Then $$y(k) = 1 + 2q(k) + 2q(k)^4 + 2q(k)^9 ... \rightarrow y = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} q^{n^2} $$ So I tried to derive this the usual way anyone in 1846 would.
