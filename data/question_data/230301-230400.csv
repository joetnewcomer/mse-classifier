2,Set of all real numbers with a '$2$' in their decimal expansion,Set of all real numbers with a '' in their decimal expansion,2,"It is a common question in an elementary probability or combinatorics class to ask ""How many integers between $1$ and $10^k$ have at least one '$2$' in their decimal expansion?"" This result can then be generalized further, and analyzed as $k$ approaches infinity However, I'm curious about something slightly different; rather than the set of all integers with a '$2$' in their decimal expansion, I want to consider the set of all real numbers with a '$2$' in their decimal expansion. More specifically, I have the following questions: 1) Which has greater cardinality: the set of all real numbers with a '$2$' in their decimal expansion (which we will denote by $S$), or the set of all real numbers without a '$2$' in their decimal expansion (ie $\mathbb{R} \setminus S$)? 2) In comparing the above sets, $S$ and $\mathbb{R} \setminus S$, by 'how much' is one set's size greater than the other? I realize this is a poorly phrased question, and am not really looking for a formal answer. Anything that gives some general intuition would be much appreciated. For question 1, I am leaning towards thinking that the latter set, of all real numbers without a '$2$' in their decimal expansion, would be larger. To show this, I've tried using alternative bases and formulating some sort of mapping between the sets, to no avail. I also thought about simplifying the problem to just include numbers in the set $[0, 1]$, and then generalizing for $\mathbb{R}$. However, I haven't found anything by doing this either. I haven't yet attempted the second question, although I think the way I approach the first will largely dictate the answer here. I'd appreciate any and all help with this problem.

Show that the relation is an equivalence and find the equivalence classes. My solution: Let us write $\mathbb{Z}$ as $\mathbb{Z^+ \cup {Z^-}^*}$ . If $a \in \mathbb{Z^+}$ then $a \ \rho \ b$ implies $b \in \mathbb{Z^+}$. Similarly for other set. We then proceed by showing the reflexivity [ $a \ \rho\ a \ \forall a \in \mathbb{Z}$ since if $a \in \mathbb{Z}$ then a is positive and relates to itself and if $a \in \mathbb{{Z^-}^*}$, $a=a$ ] , symmetry [ leaving out the case when $a \in \mathbb{Z^+}$ and  $b \in \mathbb{{Z^-}^*}$ as in this case a does not relate to b ], and transitivity [ following similar methods].

Now is there an element of $M$ such that (according to $M$) it contains exactly those Godel encoding as above?
