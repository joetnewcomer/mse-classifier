To clarify, although this has a fairly standard-looking form, I haven't been able to find an answer anywhere and I've tried a few of the usual tricks (although I'm a tad rusty). I have tried integration by parts to reduce to a simpler or recursive form but this seems to make the expression more complex, and likewise with the substitution $u=\sin(x)$ . Equally, it is relatively easy to see that the expression under the integral is non-positive. Taking a derivative $$ \frac{d}{dx} \sin^{n}(x) \ln(\sin(x)) = \sin^{n-1}(x) \cos(x) (1 + n \ln(\sin(x))) = 0$$ gives a has minimum at $-\frac{1}{en}$ . Together these give the reasonably simple bounds: $$-\frac{\pi}{en} < I(n) < 0.$$ But numerically these don't appear to be particularly tight, so I'm still hopeful of an exact solution or an improvement.","Is the integral analytically tractable for ?

So for Green's theorem $$\oint_{\partial \Omega} {\textbf{F}} \cdot d {\textbf{S}} = \iint_{\Omega} \text{2d-curl}{\textbf{F}} \, d\Omega$$ and also by Divergence (2-D) Theorem, $$\oint_{\partial \Omega} {\textbf{F}} \cdot d {\textbf{S}} = \iint_{\Omega} \text{div}{\textbf{F}} \, d\Omega$$. Since they can evaluate the same flux integral, then $$\iint_{\Omega} \text{2d-curl}{\textbf{F}} \, d\Omega = \int_{\Omega} \text{div}{\textbf{F}} \, d\Omega.$$ Is there an intuition for why the summing of divergence in a region is equal to the summing of the curl in a region in 2-D?",,"['integration', 'greens-theorem']"

And those types integral has a closed form, namely $$ I = \frac{\pi}{2}p(1-p)(b-a)^2\csc(p\pi) $$ But then I also came across integrals like these along the way $$ \int_0^3 \frac{x^{3/4}(3-x)^{1/4}}{5-x}dx $$ So I asked myself, is there a more generalized form of the $I$ integral, namely $$ J = \int_a^b \frac{(x-a)^p(b-x)^{1-p}}{\text{P}(x)} dx $$ Where $\text{P}(x)$ is any polynomial. To begin with, I decided to make a more concise (?) definition of the function $$ \text{P}(x) = \prod_{k=1}^n (x-c_k)^{q_k} $$ Where $c_k$ is the $k$ -th root of $\text{P}(x)$ and $q_k$ is the $k$ -th root's multiplicity. $c_1 \not = c_2 \not = c_3 \not = \ldots \not = c_n$ , $c_k \not \in (a, b)$ , and if $a$ or $b$ is a root of $\text{P}(x)$ then they can't have a multiplicity of 2 or higher First off, I'll analyze this function $$ f(z) = \frac{(z-a)^p (b-z)^{1-p}}{\text{P}(z)} \\ = \frac{|z-a|^p |b-z|^{1-p}}{\text{P}(z)} e^{i(p\arg(z-a) + (1-p)\arg(b-z))} $$ The poles of this function are $z = c_k$ with order $q_k$ for $k = 1,2,3,\ldots, n$ To begin, I integrated $f(z)$ over the dogbone contour Which means I'll have $$ \oint_{\text{Dogbone}} f(z) dz = \left(\int_{\gamma_1} + \int_{\gamma_2} + \int_{\mu_1} + \int_{\mu_2}\right) f(z) dz $$ If we call the radius of the $\mu$ paths $\varepsilon$ , and have it approach 0, then both integrals over $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ will go to 0 also. The integral over $\gamma_1$ will be $J$ and the integral over $\gamma_2$ will be $-e^{(1-p)2\pi} J$ . Which means $$ \oint_{\text{Dogbone}} f(z) dz = \left(1 - e^{(1-p)2\pi}\right) J $$ Now, to continue, we can inflate the contour into this I'll call the big circular contour $\Gamma$ and the small ones surrounding the poles at $c_k$ $\omega_k$ . Which means we'll have $$ \left(1 - e^{(1-p)2\pi}\right) J = \left(\oint_\Gamma + \sum_{k=1}^n \oint_{\omega_k}\right) f(z) dz $$ For the $\omega$ integrals, we can simply use residue theorem for higher order poles $$ \oint_{\omega_k} f(z) dz = - \frac{2\pi i}{(q_k - 1)!} \lim_{z \rightarrow c_k} \partial_z^{q_k - 1} (z-c_k)^{q_k} f(z) $$ Plugging it back into the equation $$ \left(1 - e^{(1-p)2\pi}\right) J = \oint_\Gamma f(z) dz - \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{2 \pi i}{(q_k - 1)!} \lim_{z \rightarrow c_k} \partial_z^{q_k - 1} (z-c_k)^{q_k} f(z) $$ Now, my main problem is the final integral. I know that it'll be the residue of $f(z)$ at infinity, I know there's a formula for it, but I have no idea of how to evaluate such residues.

96,Almost sure convergence implies convegence in distribution - proof using monotone convergence,Almost sure convergence implies convegence in distribution - proof using monotone convergence,,"I'm trying to understand the following proof of the statement : ""Almost sure convergence implies convegence in distribution"" The definition of convergence in distribution is given as follows : $X_n$ converges in distribution to $X$ if and only if for all bounded real function $f$ we have : $$\lim_{n \rightarrow +\infty  }E\left[f(X_n)\right]=E\left[f(X)\right]$$ The proof goes like this : If $X_n$ converges almost surely to $X$ then $f(X_n)$ converges almost surely to $f(X)$. Now using the dominated convergence theorem which is : $$\lim_{n \rightarrow +\infty  } \int f_n d\mu = \int f d\mu $$ we get : $$\lim_{n \rightarrow +\infty  }E[f(X_n)]=E[f(X)].$$ My question is this : How using the dominated convergence theorem gets us from :  $$f(X_n)\rightarrow^{a.s.} f(X)$$ to $$\lim_{n \rightarrow +\infty  }E[f(X_n)]=E[f(X)]$$ given that the almost sure convergence is given by : $P\left[\lim_{n \rightarrow + \infty} X_n = X\right] = 1$? One of my attempts is to write the convergence in distribution in the form of integrals like this : $$\lim_{n \rightarrow +\infty  }E[f(X_n)]=E[f(X)]$$ is equivalent to : $$\lim_{n \rightarrow +\infty  }\int f(y) \phi_n(y) dy=\int f(y) \phi(y) dy$$ with $\phi$ the density of $X$ and $\phi_n$ the density of $X_n$. But this is a little different from the monotone convergence theorem result. In the dominated convergence theorem we have the same measure, $\mu$, but writing the expectations gives us two different measures, which are $\phi_n dy$ and $\phi dy$, respectively the cumulative distributions for $X_n$ and $X$ Any help please? I appreciate if you can tell me why my attempt is not leading anywhere and at the same time give your own proof.
