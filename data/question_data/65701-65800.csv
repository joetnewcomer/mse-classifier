I fully understand the simpler problem, that is, out of 10 people, probability that at least 2 share the same birthday. An easier way to solve this problem than solving for the probability that any 2 or more of the 10 people share a birthday is to solve for the probability that all of the people have unique birthdays (non-shared) and subtracting that from 100%.

Then, the second person has 364 days that could be their birthday without sharing with someone else, because person 1’s birthday is one of those days. This process goes on for all of the 10 people, until the 10th person has 356 possible days that could be their birthday. The easiest way to express the total possible combinations of days in which none of the 10 people share a birthday is $365 \times 364 \times 363 \times … 356$ , that is, $\frac{365!}{355!}$ .

My approach is as follows: First, let's calculate the total number of possible outcomes, which is the total number of ways to assign birthdays to 10 people without restrictions. Since there are 365 days in a non-leap year, each person can have a birthday on any of these days. Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is $365^{10}$ . Then we calculate the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways to choose 2 people out of 10 to share the same birthday, multiplied by the number of ways to choose a specific birthday for them: The number of ways to choose 2 people out of 10 is: ${10 \choose 2}=\frac{10!}{(10−2)!2!}$ .

We have 10 players and two courts in our badminton matches. We define a shift to be an instance of badminton games happening where two teams of 4 players are playing against each other in the respective courts and the remaining two are resting. We assume that we always are able to have the two games happening side by side in the two courts and they both end at around the same time. That is one can imagine in a permutation of these ten players in each subsequent shifts . Now I want to solve for taking the least number of shifts to get all the players to encounter each other. I can combinatorially create permutations where following 6 shifts each player encounters another. I would like to know whether there can be no possibility of getting the solution with lesser number of shifts .

We have 10 players and two courts in our badminton matches. We define a shift to be an instance of badminton games happening where two teams of 4 players are playing against each other in the respective courts and the remaining two are resting. We assume that we always are able to have the two games happening side by side in the two courts and they both end at around the same time. That is one can imagine in a permutation of these ten players in each subsequent shifts . Now I want to solve for taking the least number of shifts to get all the players to encounter each other. I can combinatorially create permutations where following 6 shifts each player encounters another.

What I’ve tried Below are my attempts to solve the equation $$\dbinom n {11} = 12,376$$ and its equivalent $$\dfrac {n!}{11!(n-11)!}=12,376$$ First Simplifying factorials in the last equation I get $$\dfrac{n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)\cdots(n-10)}{11!} = 12,376$$ I’ve found out that the numerator in the left part of the equation matches the definition of falling factorial , but I don’t fully understand this concept. Besides, I’m sure there should be a simple solution that does not involve anything advanced because the problem comes from the first chapter of the book on discrete and combinatorial mathematics intended for beginners. I’ve tried to simplify the numerator of the left part of the equation as follows: $(n-1)(n-10) = n^2 -11n + 10$ $(n-2)(n-9) = n^2 -11n + 18$ $(n-3)(n-8) = n^2 -11n + 24$ $(n-4)(n-7) = n^2 -11n + 28$ $(n-5)(n-6) = n^2 -11n + 30$ Let $a = n^2 -11n$ , then $$\dfrac {n(a+10)(a+18)(a+24)(a+28)(a+30)} {11!} = 12,376$$ However, I was unable to simplify it further. Do I miss something from elementary algebra here? Second Also, I’ve tried to use Pascal’s identity to represent $\dbinom n {11}$ as a sum of binomial coefficients: $$\large \displaystyle \begin{align*} \dbinom n {11} &= \dbinom {n-1} {11} + \dbinom {n-1} {10} \\ &= \bigg[\dbinom {n-2} {11} + \dbinom {n-2} {10} \bigg] + \bigg[\dbinom {n-2} {10} + \dbinom {n-2} {9} \bigg] \\ &= \dbinom {n-2} {11} + 2 \dbinom {n-2} {10} + \dbinom {n-2} {9} \\ &= \dbinom {n-3} {11} + 3 \dbinom {n-3} {10} + 3 \dbinom {n-3} {9} + \dbinom {n-3} {8} \\ &= \dbinom {n-4} {11} + 4 \dbinom {n-4} {10} + 6 \dbinom {n-4} {9} + 4 \dbinom {n-4} {8} + \dbinom {n-4} {7} \\ &  \vdots \\ &= \dbinom {11} 0 \dbinom {n-11} {11} + \dbinom {11} 1 \dbinom {n-11} {10} + \dbinom {11} 2 \dbinom {n-11} {9} + \cdots + \dbinom {11} {11}  \dbinom {n-11} {0} \\ &= \sum_{k=0}^{11} \dbinom {11} k \dbinom {n-11} {11-k}  \end{align*}$$ Then $$\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{11} \dbinom {11} k \dbinom {n-11} {11-k} =12,376$$ . I tried to apply Vandermonde’s identity here, but actually, I could only prove that the equation above is the same equation I'd started from. $\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{11} \dbinom {11} k \dbinom {n-11} {11-k} = \dbinom {n-11+11} {11} = \dbinom n {11}$ . Also, I was thinking about using the binomial theorem here. May I rewrite the equation above as $\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{11} \dbinom {11} k x^k y^{11-k}= 12,376$ , where $x,y \in R$ ? If so, then $(x+y)^{11}=12,376$ , but what should I do with it? Third (continuation of the second) Since $\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{11} \dbinom {11} k \dbinom {n-11} {11-k} =  \sum_{k=0}^{11} \dbinom {11} k \dbinom {n-11} {k} = 1 +  \sum_{k=1}^{11} \dbinom {11} k \dbinom {n-11} {k}$ , I can rewrite $\dbinom n {11} = 12,376$ as $$\displaystyle 1 + \sum_{k=1}^{11} \dbinom {11} k \dbinom {n-11} {k} = 12,376$$ Then $$ \sum_{k=0}^{10} \dbinom {11} k \dbinom {n-11} {k} = 12,375 $$ Then I thought about the representation of each term in $\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^{11} \dbinom {11} k \dbinom {n-11} {k}$ using Pascal’s identity recursively, as I did previously with $\dbinom n {11}$ . $$ \large \begin{align*} \displaystyle & \sum_{k=1}^{11} \dbinom {11} k \dbinom {n-11} {k} &\\ &= \dbinom {11} 1 \sum_{k_1=0}^1 \dbinom 1 {k_1} \dbinom {n-12} {k_1} + \dbinom 2 {k_2} \dbinom {11} 2 \sum_{k_2=0}^2 \dbinom {n-13} {k_2} + \cdots \\ &\qquad+ \dbinom {11} {11} \sum_{k_{11}=0}^{11} \dbinom {11} {k_{11}} \dbinom {n-21} {k_{11}} \\ &= 11 + \dbinom {11} 1 \dbinom {n-12} 1 + 55 + \dbinom {11} 2 \sum_{k_2=1}^2 \dbinom 2 {k_2}\dbinom {n-13} {k_2} + \cdots \\ &\qquad + 1 + \dbinom {11} {11} \sum_{k_{11}=1}^{11} \dbinom {11} {k_{11}} \dbinom {n-21} {k_{11}} \\ & = 11^2-1 + \sum_{k=1}^{11}\dbinom {11} k \sum_{i=1}^{k} \dbinom k i \dbinom {n-(11+k)} i \end{align*} $$ Assuming the expression above is correct (which I really doubt), $11^2-1 + \sum_{k=1}^{11}\dbinom {11} k \sum_{i=1}^{k} \dbinom k i \dbinom {n-(11+k)} i = 12,375$ $\sum_{k=1}^{11}\dbinom {11} k \sum_{i=1}^{k} \dbinom k i \dbinom {n-(11+k)} i = 12,255$ However, it looks like this approach leads to an infinite process since the number of terms on the left side of the equation does not decrease.

At first I didn't get the points and they I tried different things of what I've learned, I couldn't go farther and eventually looked at the solution, but there are things I couldn't understand at all. The solution said that what we wanted to count was actually how many permutations of $\{1,2, \cdots, n\}$ there are such that $k$ is not at the $k^{th}$ place for any $1 \le k \le n$ . And that these permutations are called derangements. Also said that this kind of permutations are permutations with not fixed point. I know that this might be something not so difficult but I really get kind of confuse. Can someone tell with a little more detail what does it mean that stuff of permutations (With/without) fixed points? Going a little further in the solution we set as $S$ the set of all permutations of $\{1,2, \cdots , n\} $ and $A_{i}$ the set of permutations $\{a_{1},a_{2}, \cdots , a_{n}\} $ of $\{1,2, \cdots , n\} $ satisfying $a_{i} = i$ $( i = 1,2,3 ... n)$ . So, I can understand this because you can use The sieve formula to get exactly the the intersection of the complement of all the sets in which the $k_{th}$ permutation is in the $k_{th}$ place. What I can't understand very well is the cardinalities of $A_{i}$ 's sets, for example how do you know that $\lvert A_{i} \rvert = (n-1)!$ , $ \lvert A_{i} \cup A_{j} \rvert = (n-2)!$ or even that $ \lvert A_{i_{1}} \cup A_{i_{2}} \cup \cdots \cup  A_{i_{k}} \rvert = (n-k)! $ for $ ( 1 \le i_{1} < i_{2}< \cdots < i_{k} \le n)$ .

Can someone tell with a little more detail what does it mean that stuff of permutations (With/without) fixed points? Going a little further in the solution we set as the set of all permutations of and the set of permutations of satisfying . So, I can understand this because you can use The sieve formula to get exactly the the intersection of the complement of all the sets in which the permutation is in the place.

So I went on and set $A=30, B=33, C=37$ $A+B+C-A \cap B-A \cap C-B \cap C + A \cap B \cap C =40$ (Assuming that nobody got no As) So, $\overline{A}=(B-A \cap B) + (C-A \cap C) - B \cap C=10$ $\overline{B}=(A-A \cap B) + (C-B \cap C) - A \cap C=7$ $\overline{C}=(B-B \cap C) + (A-A \cap C) - A \cap B=3$ And if I sum this up and add another $A+B+C$ , then it's $3(A+B+C-A \cap B-A \cap C-B \cap C)$ , then I could calculate $A \cap B \cap C$ from it. But unfortunately, $3(A+B+C-A \cap B-A \cap C-B \cap C)$ turned out to be exactly 120, so $A+B+C-A \cap B-A \cap C-B \cap C=40$ and $A \cap B \cap C$ is $0$ !

The second task was to prove by induction that $\binom{n}{k}$ is always a natural number.

The correct answer is: $6,670,903,752,021,072,936,960$ or $6,671E21$ as was proved $12$ years ago! Or was it? Their proof never really enumerated the solutions and involved a lot of mainframe time to compute, which involved a lot of reducing test cases to make the computations complete in human time. When they said and I read that no simple combinatorial answer was possible, I immediately though, ""Well I already know one."" So I ran the numbers on a calculator but did NOT get their solution and I can't see a flaw in mine. I can not follow there solution to the end since I have to rely on their computer results.  I sent this to the author but did not hear back, which is not surprising since it is not there place to prove me wrong. I have waited and looked over my method long enough that I stand by my solution. Since this has to be expressed in the form of a question, ""What is wrong with my solution?"" So, here is, what we have all been waiting for: My Simple Combinatorial Way to Enumerate Sudoku Solution Grids Note: The problem we are trying to solve here is for N0 which is the maximum number of correct Sudoku answer grids.  So, no discussion of swapping to get equivalent solutions. There are three Bands, rows $1$-$3$, $4$-$6$, and $7$-$9$, and three Stacks columns $1$-$3$, $4$-$6$, and $7$-$9$ in a Sudoku Grid. We will start with a discussion of the first Band which is the top three rows. The three bands and stacks divide the Sudoku Grid in to $9$ Blocks, labeled $B_1$, $B_2$, and $B_3$ in Band$1$, $B_4$, $B_5$, and $B_6$ in Band$2$, and $B_7$, $B_8$, and $B_9$ in Band$3$, which also means $B_1$, $B_4$, and $B_7$ in Stack$1$, $B_2$, $B_5$, and $B_8$ in Stack$2$, and $B_3$, $B_6$, and $B_9$ in Stack$3$. Substituting Numbers for Symbol Positions We will substitute the $9$ numbers used in the $81$ squares to leave $B_1$ with the following Grid: |1 2 3| |4 5 6|     Note: 9! cases |7 8 9| With this we can now think of the numbers not as number but as symbol positions, where $9!$ different solutions will use the same symbol positions for all the $81$ squares. Describing Row Constraints for a Band Say we want to fill in Band1 and we start in what I call an All-Normal Pattern for $B_1$ Row$1$, as follows: Row 1: |1 2 3|     |     |    Note: The symbol positions in B2 and Row 2: |4 5 6|1 2 3|     |    B3 only describe the row they are in, Row 3: |7 8 9|     |1 2 3|    not the column positions. Given this as a starting point, how do we fill in the symbol positions from the $B_1$ Row2, in $B_2$? If we tried to put them in Row1 we have a problem when we get to B3 because we would need to use positions already occupied.  So, we have to follow the same All-Normal pattern as $B_1$ Row1, resulting in the following: Row 1: |1 2 3|     |4 5 6|    Note: The symbol positions in B2 and Row 2: |4 5 6|1 2 3|     |    B3 only describe the row they are in, Row 3: |7 8 9|4 5 6|1 2 3|    not the column positions. Then $B_1$ Row$3$ follows the All-Normal pattern to fill in the blanks. A Normal Symbol is defined as a symbol that goes down one to the second block and down one to the third block, where if you go below the bottom you wrap to the top of the band. Abnormal Symbol is defined as a symbol that goes down two to the second block and down two to the third block, with wrapping. An All-Normal Pattern is where all nine symbols are normal. Now lets look at a case with one abnormal symbol from $B_1$ Row$1$, we will pick $3$: Row 1: |1 2 3|     |     |    Note: The symbol positions in B2 and Row 2: |4 5 6|1 2  |    3|    B3 only describe the row they are in, Row 3: |7 8 9|    3|1 2  |    not the column positions. Here we have the symbol $3$ going down $2$, and down $2$ with a wrap, instead of down $1$ and down $1$. Now if we try to fill in $B_1$ Row$2$ and Row$3$ in $B_2$ and $B_3$ we find that we have a similar problem, unless we do the same thing as Row$1$ and pick one of the three symbols to be abnormal. The same thing can be said about having two abnormals from Row$1$, we need to repeat this for the other two Rows.  And finally we have the three abnormals case. For brevity I will leave it to the reader to validate this or they can just look at any Sudoku solution grid. Abnormal Pattern is defined as having one abnormal symbol per row in $B_1$. Normal Pattern is defined as having one normal symbol per row in $B_1$. All-Abnormal Pattern is defined as all $27$ symbols being abnormal. The normal and abnormal patterns need further clarification. For normal pattern we need to know, which of the three positions in each row in B1 contains the normal symbol. For abnormal pattern we need the same for the abnormal symbol.  For each row there are $3$ positions for a total of $3\times3\times3 = 27$. So the total number of permutations of symbols into rows in $B_2$ and $B_3$ for Band$1$ is $1$ for the All-Normal, $3\times3\times3$ for the Abnormal, $3\times3\times3$ for the Normal, and $1$ for the All-Abnormal patterns. Let us call this $R$: R = 1 + 3*3*3 + 3*3*3 + 1 = 56 permutations of 9 symbols in 3 rows. It should be noted that $R$ describes all three blocks even if you were to swap them, it is a natural constraint on any block/stack and we can use it later to describe all $3$ blocks and $3$ stacks. The rest is trivial, but I will highlight the important parts. Describing Column Constraints for $B_2$ and $B_3$ We still need to describe the column positions for the symbols in $B_2$ and $B_3$, which is just the permutations of the three number in each sub-row, which is $6$.  Let us call this $P$: P = 6*6*6 * 6*6*6 = 6*6 * 6*6 * 6*6 = 46656 permutations of 3 symbols in 6 sub-rows. Implementation Note: Because in the Normal and Abnormal cases the one value will end up in a different row then the other two, When doing the permutations only permute two symbols, $A$ and $B$, through three positions: |A B x|, |A x B|, |x A B|, |B A x|, |B x A|, |x B A| Where $A$ and $B$ are: |A B x|    For each row in B1 in the All-Normal and All-Abnormal patterns.  |x A B|    For each row in B1 where, |A x B|    in the Abnormal pattern, x is the position of abnormal symbol and, |A B x|    in the Normal pattern, x is the position normal symbol. The remaining character x will find its position as the open position in its assigned row. So for Band$1$ the total number of solutions using symbol positions is: R * P = 56 * 46656 = 2612736 Note: I can use a number between $1$ through $2612736$ to calculate a specific permutation of these solutions or I can use a solution and use the above discussion to assign a specific number to this permutation. The Constraining the Rest of the Bands and Stacks If I want to describe the starting positions for $B_4$ and $B_7$ I can use $R$ and $P$ for Stack$1$ like I did for Band1 and know all the permutations of $B_4$ and $B_7$.  Unimportant Note: Later I could do some renumbering for $B_1$ when describing Stack$1$ to gain symmetry for the final row and column descriptions. $R$ can be used on Band$2$ and Band$3$ to describe the row positions for $B_5$, $B_6$, $B_8$, and $B_9$. $R$ can be used on Stack$2$ and Stack$3$ to describe the column positions for $B_5$, $B_6$, $B_8$, and $B_9$. If I know the row and column positions for each symbol for $B_5$, $B_6$, $B_8$, and $B_9$ then the completion of each permutation just involves matching the row and column for each symbol for each block. Conclusion I can describe Band$1$ and the row positions in Band$2$ and Band$3$ as: Row Contribution = R * P * R * R = 8,193,540,096 I can describe Stack$1$ and the column positions in Stack$2$ and Stack$3$ as: Column Contribution = R * P * R * R = 8,193,540,096 The total is just multiplying these two numbers and $9!$ for substituting numbers for symbol positions Total = 9! * 8,193,540,096 * 8,193,540,096 = 2.436162195571x10^25 Since it is just multiplying digits I could list all the digits but my math package does not have that may significant digits. Unimportant Note: It might be good to swap the $P$s between the two contributions since the $P$ in row contribution fixes the column positions and vice versa, or not. So, now I have a total of numbers solutions and a design for a function that, given a number in this range, I can derive a specific solution or given a solution, I can derive its ordinal number and I know how to count through all solutions. Humorous note: $8,193,540,096 \times 8,193,540,096 = 6.7134E19$ So again, where is my mistake?","How may possible Sudoku Solution Grids are there?

When they said and I read that no simple combinatorial answer was possible, I immediately though, ""Well I already know one."" So I ran the numbers on a calculator but did NOT get their solution and I can't see a flaw in mine. I can not follow there solution to the end since I have to rely on their computer results.  I sent this to the author but did not hear back, which is not surprising since it is not there place to prove me wrong. I have waited and looked over my method long enough that I stand by my solution. Since this has to be expressed in the form of a question, ""What is wrong with my solution?"" So, here is, what we have all been waiting for: My Simple Combinatorial Way to Enumerate Sudoku Solution Grids Note: The problem we are trying to solve here is for N0 which is the maximum number of correct Sudoku answer grids.  So, no discussion of swapping to get equivalent solutions. There are three Bands, rows $1$-$3$, $4$-$6$, and $7$-$9$, and three Stacks columns $1$-$3$, $4$-$6$, and $7$-$9$ in a Sudoku Grid. We will start with a discussion of the first Band which is the top three rows. The three bands and stacks divide the Sudoku Grid in to $9$ Blocks, labeled $B_1$, $B_2$, and $B_3$ in Band$1$, $B_4$, $B_5$, and $B_6$ in Band$2$, and $B_7$, $B_8$, and $B_9$ in Band$3$, which also means $B_1$, $B_4$, and $B_7$ in Stack$1$, $B_2$, $B_5$, and $B_8$ in Stack$2$, and $B_3$, $B_6$, and $B_9$ in Stack$3$. Substituting Numbers for Symbol Positions We will substitute the $9$ numbers used in the $81$ squares to leave $B_1$ with the following Grid: |1 2 3| |4 5 6|     Note: 9! cases |7 8 9| With this we can now think of the numbers not as number but as symbol positions, where $9!$ different solutions will use the same symbol positions for all the $81$ squares. Describing Row Constraints for a Band Say we want to fill in Band1 and we start in what I call an All-Normal Pattern for $B_1$ Row$1$, as follows: Row 1: |1 2 3|     |     |    Note: The symbol positions in B2 and Row 2: |4 5 6|1 2 3|     |    B3 only describe the row they are in, Row 3: |7 8 9|     |1 2 3|    not the column positions. Given this as a starting point, how do we fill in the symbol positions from the $B_1$ Row2, in $B_2$? If we tried to put them in Row1 we have a problem when we get to B3 because we would need to use positions already occupied.  So, we have to follow the same All-Normal pattern as $B_1$ Row1, resulting in the following: Row 1: |1 2 3|     |4 5 6|    Note: The symbol positions in B2 and Row 2: |4 5 6|1 2 3|     |    B3 only describe the row they are in, Row 3: |7 8 9|4 5 6|1 2 3|    not the column positions. Then $B_1$ Row$3$ follows the All-Normal pattern to fill in the blanks. A Normal Symbol is defined as a symbol that goes down one to the second block and down one to the third block, where if you go below the bottom you wrap to the top of the band. Abnormal Symbol is defined as a symbol that goes down two to the second block and down two to the third block, with wrapping. An All-Normal Pattern is where all nine symbols are normal. Now lets look at a case with one abnormal symbol from $B_1$ Row$1$, we will pick $3$: Row 1: |1 2 3|     |     |    Note: The symbol positions in B2 and Row 2: |4 5 6|1 2  |    3|    B3 only describe the row they are in, Row 3: |7 8 9|    3|1 2  |    not the column positions. Here we have the symbol $3$ going down $2$, and down $2$ with a wrap, instead of down $1$ and down $1$. Now if we try to fill in $B_1$ Row$2$ and Row$3$ in $B_2$ and $B_3$ we find that we have a similar problem, unless we do the same thing as Row$1$ and pick one of the three symbols to be abnormal. The same thing can be said about having two abnormals from Row$1$, we need to repeat this for the other two Rows.  And finally we have the three abnormals case. For brevity I will leave it to the reader to validate this or they can just look at any Sudoku solution grid. Abnormal Pattern is defined as having one abnormal symbol per row in $B_1$. Normal Pattern is defined as having one normal symbol per row in $B_1$. All-Abnormal Pattern is defined as all $27$ symbols being abnormal. The normal and abnormal patterns need further clarification. For normal pattern we need to know, which of the three positions in each row in B1 contains the normal symbol. For abnormal pattern we need the same for the abnormal symbol.  For each row there are $3$ positions for a total of $3\times3\times3 = 27$. So the total number of permutations of symbols into rows in $B_2$ and $B_3$ for Band$1$ is $1$ for the All-Normal, $3\times3\times3$ for the Abnormal, $3\times3\times3$ for the Normal, and $1$ for the All-Abnormal patterns. Let us call this $R$: R = 1 + 3*3*3 + 3*3*3 + 1 = 56 permutations of 9 symbols in 3 rows. It should be noted that $R$ describes all three blocks even if you were to swap them, it is a natural constraint on any block/stack and we can use it later to describe all $3$ blocks and $3$ stacks. The rest is trivial, but I will highlight the important parts. Describing Column Constraints for $B_2$ and $B_3$ We still need to describe the column positions for the symbols in $B_2$ and $B_3$, which is just the permutations of the three number in each sub-row, which is $6$.  Let us call this $P$: P = 6*6*6 * 6*6*6 = 6*6 * 6*6 * 6*6 = 46656 permutations of 3 symbols in 6 sub-rows. Implementation Note: Because in the Normal and Abnormal cases the one value will end up in a different row then the other two, When doing the permutations only permute two symbols, $A$ and $B$, through three positions: |A B x|, |A x B|, |x A B|, |B A x|, |B x A|, |x B A| Where $A$ and $B$ are: |A B x|    For each row in B1 in the All-Normal and All-Abnormal patterns.  |x A B|    For each row in B1 where, |A x B|    in the Abnormal pattern, x is the position of abnormal symbol and, |A B x|    in the Normal pattern, x is the position normal symbol. The remaining character x will find its position as the open position in its assigned row. So for Band$1$ the total number of solutions using symbol positions is: R * P = 56 * 46656 = 2612736 Note: I can use a number between $1$ through $2612736$ to calculate a specific permutation of these solutions or I can use a solution and use the above discussion to assign a specific number to this permutation. The Constraining the Rest of the Bands and Stacks If I want to describe the starting positions for $B_4$ and $B_7$ I can use $R$ and $P$ for Stack$1$ like I did for Band1 and know all the permutations of $B_4$ and $B_7$.  Unimportant Note: Later I could do some renumbering for $B_1$ when describing Stack$1$ to gain symmetry for the final row and column descriptions. $R$ can be used on Band$2$ and Band$3$ to describe the row positions for $B_5$, $B_6$, $B_8$, and $B_9$. $R$ can be used on Stack$2$ and Stack$3$ to describe the column positions for $B_5$, $B_6$, $B_8$, and $B_9$. If I know the row and column positions for each symbol for $B_5$, $B_6$, $B_8$, and $B_9$ then the completion of each permutation just involves matching the row and column for each symbol for each block. Conclusion I can describe Band$1$ and the row positions in Band$2$ and Band$3$ as: Row Contribution = R * P * R * R = 8,193,540,096 I can describe Stack$1$ and the column positions in Stack$2$ and Stack$3$ as: Column Contribution = R * P * R * R = 8,193,540,096 The total is just multiplying these two numbers and $9!$ for substituting numbers for symbol positions Total = 9! * 8,193,540,096 * 8,193,540,096 = 2.436162195571x10^25 Since it is just multiplying digits I could list all the digits but my math package does not have that may significant digits. Unimportant Note: It might be good to swap the $P$s between the two contributions since the $P$ in row contribution fixes the column positions and vice versa, or not. So, now I have a total of numbers solutions and a design for a function that, given a number in this range, I can derive a specific solution or given a solution, I can derive its ordinal number and I know how to count through all solutions. Humorous note: $8,193,540,096 \times 8,193,540,096 = 6.7134E19$ So again, where is my mistake?",,"['combinatorics', 'puzzle', 'sudoku']"

If $r=1$, we get $n$ choices for a repeated digit, then $n+1\choose 2$ choices to place two non-unique digits, and then $(n-1)!$ choices for the remaining unique digits, totaling in $n {n+1\choose 2} (n-1)!={n+1\choose 2} n!$ arrangements. However, when $r$ grows we have many shapes for repeated digits, corresponding to partitions of $r$, and the formulas seem intimidating. Another way to describe this class of arrangements, is to call them permutations with unspecified repetitions, i.e. we have all digits present, the order matters, but we are not given which digits repeat. The strings of digits having these properties are sometimes called 'pandigital numbers' (except that they don't allow $0$ in the first position). Question: is there a nice closed formula for the number of such class of arrangements? UPDATE: User ""Especially Lime"" has provided a nice answer using inclusion-exclusion principle (and I accepted his answer). It turned out that his formula simplifies to  $$ n! S(n+r,n) $$ where $S(n,m)$ is the Stirling number of the second kind , measuring the number of ways to partition an $n$-element set into $m$ nonempty subsets. Now it is obvious how to obtain this number from the very beginning: the shapes describing which positions among places $1,2,\dots,n+r$ are unique and which repeat, define a partition of the $n+r$-element set into $n$ nonempty subsets. Acting by $n!$ permutations by renumbering labels on parts yields the result.","I was pondering over a closed formula for the number of arrangements of elements ('digits') $1,2,\dots,n$ into a string of $n+r$ elements, such that all digits are present at least once.

92,Speed meeting pairings,Speed meeting pairings,,"I’m an elementary grade teacher and I want to organize a speed meeting event at the start of the school year to introduce the new staff. Specifically, I want to organize 3-minute rounds during which trios of teachers would chat. Trios would then be split and reorganized for another round and so on. The idea is to organize the trios and the round so that any pair of teachers cannot be in the same trio more than once. In other words, if Arlene gets matched with Bob and Carlito in round 1, she could no longer be match with any of those two. She could still be matched with Denise, Farley or any other teacher. In order for such a pairing system to work, there must be an odd number of attendees that is divisible by 3 (so 3, 9 or 15 people should do). Otherwise, there would either be some tables with less than 3 persons or some people left in pairs for the last round. Through trial and error, I was able to find two working configuration of pairings for a 9-persons meeting: 1st round: ABC  DEF     GHI 2nd round:  ADG     BEI     CFH 3rd round:  AEH     BFG     CDI 4th round:  AFI     BDH     CEG Things get way more complicated with 15 or 21 attendees (the latter being the target I have in mind for the event to be held in a couple of weeks). My wife and I tried to code something in R to find a working configuration, but we couldn’t beat this puzzle. Is anybody able to help me on that one? Can anybody point me to an algorithm (or to a solution!)?
