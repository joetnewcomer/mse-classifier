1,"If $G$ is a group, then $a \ast x = b$ has a unique solution.","If  is a group, then  has a unique solution.",G a \ast x = b,"From ""A First Course In Abstract Algebra"" by John B. Fraleigh Theorem If $G$ is a group with binary operation $\ast$ , and if $a$ and $b$ are any elements of $G$ , then the linear equations $a \ast x = b$ and $y \ast a = b$ have unique solutions $x$ and $y$ in $G$ . Proof First we show the existence of at least one solution by just computing that $a' \ast b$ is a solution of $a \ast x = b$ . Note that $$\begin{align*} a \ast (a' \ast b) &= (a \ast a') \ast b & &\text{associative law} \\  &= e \ast b & &\text{definition of $a'$} \\  &= b & &\text{property of $e$} \\ \end{align*}$$ Thus $x = a' \ast b$ is a solution of $a \ast x = b$ . In a similar fashion, $y = b \ast a'$ is a solution of $y \ast a = b$ . To show uniqueness of $y$ , we use the standard method of assuming that we have two solutions, $y_1$ and $y_2$ , so that $y_1 \ast a = b$ and $y_2 \ast a = b$ . Then $y_1 \ast a = y_2 \ast a$ , and by Theorem 4.15, $y_1 = y_2$ . The uniqueness of $x$ follows similarly. $\blacksquare$ My question. Why didn't Fraleigh simply solve the equation to show that a solution exists? I mean: given the equation $a \ast x = b$ we can do as follows $$\begin{align*}a \ast x &= b \\ a' \ast (a \ast x) &= a' \ast b \\ (a' \ast a) \ast x &= a' \ast b \\ e \ast x &= a' \ast b \\ x &= a' \ast b\end{align*}$$ and this shows two things: that a solution exists and also that the solution is unique.

7,Question about affine plane minus origin not being affine,Question about affine plane minus origin not being affine,,"I am confused about the example given in Vakil's algebraic geometry notes that states $U:=\mathbb{A}_k^2-\{(x,y)\}$ is not an affine scheme. Questions about this example have been asked on here before, but none seem to have the same confusion as I do (nor is my confusion relieved by the answers provided). We start by assuming that $U$ is affine. Say $(U,\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{A}_k^2|U})=(\operatorname{Spec}A,\mathcal{O}_{\operatorname{Spec}A})$ for some ring $A$ . Then we can recover $A$ by global setions: $A=\Gamma(U,\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{A}_2|U})$ , which we have previously identified to be $k[x,y]$ . So by assuming $U$ is affine, we have that $U\cong\mathbb{A}^2_k$ . Now, the next part is what I have been struggling with.

From my understanding of the degree of a finite field extension, the degree is equal to the degree of the minimum polynomial for the root $2^{\frac{1}{3}}$. Now this has the minimum polynomial $p(x) = x^3 - 2$. So by my understanding of the this definition, we should have $[\mathbb{Q}(2^{\frac{1}{3}}):\mathbb{Q}] = 3$. But $p(x)$ has two additional roots which do not exist in the field in $\mathbb{Q}(2^{\frac{1}{3}})$ but do exist in the field extension $\mathbb{Q}(2^{\frac{1}{3}}, \omega)$ where $\omega = e^{\frac{2}{3}\pi i}$. But then the minimum polynomial of $\mathbb{Q}(2^{\frac{1}{3}}, \omega)$ is still our $p(x) = x^3 - 2$. To me, this seems to imply that $[\mathbb{Q}(2^{\frac{1}{3}}, \omega):\mathbb{Q}] = 3$.

But then the minimum polynomial of $\mathbb{Q}(2^{\frac{1}{3}}, \omega)$ is still our $p(x) = x^3 - 2$. To me, this seems to imply that $[\mathbb{Q}(2^{\frac{1}{3}}, \omega):\mathbb{Q}] = 3$. I also know and understand that for finite field extensions that  $$[\mathbb{Q}(2^{\frac{1}{3}}, \omega):\mathbb{Q}] = [\mathbb{Q}(2^{\frac{1}{3}}, \omega ):\mathbb{Q}(2^{\frac{1}{3}})][\mathbb{Q}(2^{\frac{1}{3}}):\mathbb{Q}]$$ But this seems to imply that when solving that $[\mathbb{Q}(2^{\frac{1}{3}}, \omega ):\mathbb{Q}(2^{\frac{2}{3}})] = 1$ which would also imply that $\mathbb{Q}(2^{\frac{1}{3}}, \omega )=\mathbb{Q}(2^{\frac{2}{3}})$. I am almost certain that the last statement is false, but I am unsure where I may be making mistakes with my definitions or applying theorems incorrectly, or if it is just a simple mistake on my part.

Then let $B = S^{-1}A$, $f : A \to B$ be the natural map, and $\partial_B$ be the natural extension of $\partial_A$ to $B$. We of course always have  $$f(\ker \partial_A) \subseteq \ker \partial_B.$$ Broadly speaking, under what situations can we guarantee that this an equality? Here are some observations. If $A$ is a field, there's of course nothing to do. If $A$ is of positive characteristic $p$, there will likely be problems (even if $A$ is a domain). For example, if we take $A = \mathbb{F}_p[t]$ with $\partial_A$ being differentiation with respect to $t$, then $\ker \partial_A = \mathbb{F}_p[t^p]$. If we let $B = \mathrm{Frac}(A) = \mathbb{F}_p(t)$, then $\ker \partial_B = \mathbb{F}_p(t^p)$, which is of course strictly larger. If $A$ is not a domain, there will likely be problems (even in characteristic 0). For example, let $A$ be the ring of smooth functions $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ with $\partial_A$ being usual differentiation. Then $\ker \partial_A = \mathbb{R}$. Moreover, we know that there exist $f, g \in A$ such that the Wronskian $W(f,g) = fg' - f'g = 0$ despite the fact that $f$ and $g$ are $\mathbb{R}$-linearly independent. (An explicit example of such a pair can be found in Bôcher's note from 1900 ""On linear dependence of functions of one variable."") So, if we let $S$ be the multiplicative subset generated by $g$, note that $$\partial_B(f/g) = -W(f,g)/g^2 = 0,$$ so $f/g \in \ker \partial_B$ but it is not in $f(\ker \partial_A) = \mathbb{R}$ since $f$ and $g$ are $\mathbb{R}$-linearly independent. The subring of constants in a differential field is itself necessarily a field. So, if $A$ is a domain and $B = \mathrm{Frac}(A)$, we know that $\ker \partial_B$ must be a field, so there will be problems if $\ker \partial_A$ is not already a field. For example, let $A = \mathbb{Q}[x,y]$ and $\partial_A$ is differentiation with respect to $y$, so that $\ker \partial_A = \mathbb{Q}[x]$. Taking $B = \mathrm{Frac}(A) = \mathbb{Q}(x,y)$, we get $\ker \partial_B = \mathbb{Q}(x)$. So... putting together these observations... Do we have equality when $A$ is a domain such that $\ker \partial_A$ is a field of characteristic 0? (When $A$ is a domain, we may as well assume that $B = \mathrm{Frac}(A)$.) If the above conditions aren't sufficient, are there any further (non-tautological) conditions we can impose on $A$ and $\partial_A$ to guarantee equality? In addition to these specific questions, I'd love to hear anything people have to say about the broad question above also (whether that be in the form of general statements or fun counterexamples).","Fix a commutative ring $A$, a derivation $\partial_A$ on $A$, and a multiplicative set $S$ in $A$. Then let $B = S^{-1}A$, $f : A \to B$ be the natural map, and $\partial_B$ be the natural extension of $\partial_A$ to $B$. We of course always have  $$f(\ker \partial_A) \subseteq \ker \partial_B.$$ Broadly speaking, under what situations can we guarantee that this an equality? Here are some observations. If $A$ is a field, there's of course nothing to do. If $A$ is of positive characteristic $p$, there will likely be problems (even if $A$ is a domain). For example, if we take $A = \mathbb{F}_p[t]$ with $\partial_A$ being differentiation with respect to $t$, then $\ker \partial_A = \mathbb{F}_p[t^p]$. If we let $B = \mathrm{Frac}(A) = \mathbb{F}_p(t)$, then $\ker \partial_B = \mathbb{F}_p(t^p)$, which is of course strictly larger. If $A$ is not a domain, there will likely be problems (even in characteristic 0). For example, let $A$ be the ring of smooth functions $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ with $\partial_A$ being usual differentiation. Then $\ker \partial_A = \mathbb{R}$.

77,"What could be said about centralizers of normal subgroups if $G$ contains a simple, non-abelian maximal subgroup","What could be said about centralizers of normal subgroups if  contains a simple, non-abelian maximal subgroup",G,"Let $G$ be a finite group containing a maximal simple and non-abelian group, is it true that the centraliser of each normal subgroup is either trivial or a minimal normal subgroups? EDIT : Maybe to give some context. If $G$ contains a maximal subgroup which is core-free, then this property holds for the centraliser of each normal subgroup. For a proof, let $G$ be a group and $L$ be a maximal core-free group, meaning that the intersection of all conjugates of $L$ is trivial, in particular $L$ contains no normal subgroup of $G$. Now let $N \unlhd G$ be non-trivial, as $L \cap N = 1$ we have $G = LN$. Also $C_G(N) \unlhd G$ and so $C_G(N) \cap L \unlhd L$ and therefore $L \le N_G(C_G(N)\cap L)$. As $N \le C_G(C_G(N))$ we have  $$ N \le C_G(C_G(N) \cap L) \le N_G(C_G(N)\cap L) $$ which implies $G = LN \le N_G(C_G(N)\cap L)$, i.e. $C_G(N) \cap L) \unlhd G$, and as $L$ is core-free it follows that $C_G(N) \cap L = 1$. Now let $M \le C_G(N)$ be a non-trivial normal subgroup of $G$, then again $M \cap L = 1$ and so $G = LM$. By Dedekind's Identity we have with $M \le C_G(N) \le LM$ $$  C_G(N) = M(C_G(N) \cap L) = M $$ hence either $C_G(N) = 1$ or it is a minimal normal subgroup of $G$. Now I am conjecturing that if $L$ is simple and non-abelian, a similar conclusion could be drawn, but I am stuck in the proof.","Let $G$ be a finite group containing a maximal simple and non-abelian group, is it true that the centraliser of each normal subgroup is either trivial or a minimal normal subgroups?

98,"What is a ""connection"" in algebraic terms?","What is a ""connection"" in algebraic terms?",,"It seems that I read this somewhere else, but I did not find the correct reference now. We know that a vector bundle $E\to M$ is a (projective or locally free) module of $C^\infty(M)$. Then how to express the connection on $E$ pure algebraicaly? In other words, the formulation should lead to a notion of connection for any module over a (differential?) algebra.","It seems that I read this somewhere else, but I did not find the correct reference now.

99,About generator of symmetric group $S_n$,About generator of symmetric group,S_n,"I read this link . In Theorem $2.7 $, it is mentioned that for $n\geq 3$ except for $n = 5, 6, 8$, symmetric group $S_n$ is generated by an element of order $2$ and an element of order $3$. However,  we also know that for $n\geq 2$, $S_n$ is generated by the transposition $(1 2)$ and the $n$-cycle $(12\ldots n)$. If we use later result then $S_4$ is generated by transposition $(1 2)$ and  $4$-cycle $(1234)$ which contradicts result of Theorem $2. 7$ since order of four cycle is four. Could anybody explain me where I am going wrong? I would be very much grateful. Thanks for your time.","I read this link .
