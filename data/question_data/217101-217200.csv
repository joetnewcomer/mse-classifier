I tried several different things, but I hit dead ends. Then I tried to equate coefficients and got $k\cos b=\sqrt3$ and $k\sin b=1$ which simplified to: $\cos b=\displaystyle{\sqrt3 \over k}$ and $\sin b=\displaystyle{1\over k}$.

23,When is the sine angle addition formula actually useful?,When is the sine angle addition formula actually useful?,,"My opinion is that there is no need to remember the formula for sine angle addition, that is, that $\sin(a)\cos(b)+\sin(b)\cos(a) = \sin(a+b)$ . My reasoning is as follows: Case 1: If you have both angles $a$ and $b$ , simply calculate $\sin(a+b)$ directly. Case 2: Let's say you start off with, not the angles, but the actual measurements themselves, to which the sine and cosine of a will be $y_1$ and $x_1$ , and the sine and cosine of $b$ will be $y_2$ and $x_2$ . From here, we can calculate angles $a$ and $b$ via $\arctan(y_1/x_1)$ and $\arctan(y_2/x_2)$ , respectively, and then just do what we did previously in case 1. Additionally, if you have one angle, but you only have the $x/y$ measurements of the other angle, then this is really just case 2 again.
