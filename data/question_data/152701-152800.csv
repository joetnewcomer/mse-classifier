1,Relation between the Dedekind Zeta Function and Quadratic Reciprocity,Relation between the Dedekind Zeta Function and Quadratic Reciprocity,,"I was trying to learn a little about the Dedekind zeta function . The first place I looked at was obviously the Wikipedia article above. So my question comes from a sentence by the end of the article in the section on relations to other L-functions . That section states that if you have an abelian extension $K/\mathbb{Q} \,$, then the Dedekind zeta function of $K$ is a product of Dirichlet L-functions . In particular it states that if $K$ is a quadratic field, then the ratio $$\frac{\zeta_K (s)}{\zeta(s)} = L(s, \chi)$$ or equivalently, that $$\zeta_K (s) = \zeta(s) L(s, \chi)$$ where $\zeta(s)$ is the Riemann zeta function and $L(s, \chi) \,$ is the Dirichlet L-function associated to the Dirichlet character defined by the Jacobi symbol as follows. If $K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d}) \,$, and $D$ is the discriminant of this number field, then $$\chi(n) := \left ( \frac{D}{n} \right )$$ Then the Wikipedia article says the following: That the zeta function of a quadratic field is a product of the Riemann zeta function and a certain Dirichlet L-function is an analytic formulation of the quadratic reciprocity law of Gauss. This is were I was absolutely amazed, because even though I've seen in the past that the existence of the Euler product for the Riemann zeta function is equivalent to the unique factorization property of the integers, which apparently is also reflected more generally in the context of Dedekind zeta functions and number fields, this time realized as the unique factorization of ideals into products of prime ideals, I just find marvelous that these two things can be equivalent (in some sense which I don't know yet). So my question is why is this analytic fact about the Dedekind zeta function of a quadratic number field, $$\zeta_K (s) = \zeta(s) L(s, \chi)$$ an analytic reformulation of the quadratic reciprocity law? And maybe if it is possible, to push it a little bit further, are there analogues of this, say for higher reciprocity laws, like for cubic or biquadratic reciprocity? Or is this a ""peculiarity"" that occurs just for quadratic fields? Thank you very much for any help.","I was trying to learn a little about the Dedekind zeta function .

3,Sums of prime powers,Sums of prime powers,,"You are given positive integers N, m, and k.  Is there a way to check if $$\sum_{\stackrel{p\le N}{p\text{ prime}}}p^k\equiv0\pmod m$$ faster than computing the (modular) sum? For concreteness, you can assume $e^k<m<N.$ I don't know of a way, but it's not obvious to me that no method exists.  Fast ways to prove or refute the equivalence would be of interest.  You can assume that the particular instance of the problem is 'hard', that is, the modulus is not close enough to N so that Rosser-type bounds on the sum would rule it out. With $k=0$ this is just asking if $m|\pi(N)$, so it is possible to compute the sum in time $O(N^{1/2+\varepsilon})$ using the Lagarias-Odlyzko method.  (Or more practically, one of the combinatorial $\pi(x)$ methods.)  For $k>0$ the sum is superlinear and so cannot be stored directly (without, e.g., modular reduction) but it's not clear whether a fast algorithm exists. You can think of the problem as ""Your friend, who has access to great computational resources, makes the claim (N, m, k). If her claim is true, can you prove it?

7,How many non-rational complex numbers $x$ have the property that $x^n$ and $(x+1)^n$ are rational?,How many non-rational complex numbers  have the property that  and  are rational?,x x^n (x+1)^n,"In this answer , I proved the following statement: For each positive integer $n$ , there are finitely many non-rational complex numbers $x$ such that $x^n$ and $(x+1)^n$ are rational. These complex numbers all have the form $$x(a,b)=\frac{\zeta^b-\zeta^a}{1- \zeta^b},$$ where $\zeta$ is a primitive $n$ th root of unity and $a,b$ are different nonzero elements of $\mathbb Z/n\mathbb Z$ . However, a search with a computer suggests that there are even finitely many such complex numbers over all $n$ . I have counted $26$ of them. Let $S_n$ be the set of non-rational complex numbers such that $x^n$ and $(x+1)^n$ are rational. Since $x^{nm}$ and $(x+1)^{mn}$ are rational if $x^n$ and $(1+x)^n$ are,  it follows that $S_n \subseteq S_{nm}$ . Let $S= \varinjlim S_{n!}$ . This is the set of all non-rational complex numbers $x$ for which there exists an $n$ such that $x^n$ and $(x+1)^n$ are rational. Question: Is $S$ finite?

Micah has remarked in a comment to David's answer that any $s \in S$ must be a quadratic irrational. So, the finiteness of $S$ would follow if one could prove that finitely many numbers of the form $x(a,b)$ are quadratic irrationals. In order for this to be true, it must be that $x(a,b)^{\sigma^2} = x(a,b)$ for any $\sigma \in \text{Gal}(\mathbb Q(\zeta)/\mathbb Q) = (\mathbb Z/n\mathbb Z)^\times$ . This means that we must have $$\frac{\zeta^{c^2b}-\zeta^{c^2a}}{1- \zeta^{c^2b}} = \frac{\zeta^b-\zeta^a}{1- \zeta^b}$$ for any $c \in (\mathbb Z/n\mathbb Z)^\times$ .

8,Can a number be a palindrome in 4 consecutive number bases?,Can a number be a palindrome in 4 consecutive number bases?,,"Edit $(2020)$ : Update is included at the end of the post. $4$ consecutive bases? Are there numbers that are a palindrome in $4$ consecutive number bases? I'm not counting a one digit palindrome as a palindrome. (Discarding trivial solutions.) After testing some of my plots of palindromic numbers & number systems, I noticed that I couldn't find any numbers which are a palindrome in more than $3$ consecutive bases. I was curious to find out why is this the case. I ran a simple code to check numbers up to $10^{7}$ (and all relevant bases), and didn't find any numbers that are a palindrome in $4$ or more consecutive bases. For reference, here are the smallest numbers which are palindromic in $1,2,3$ consecutive bases: $$3 = 11_2$$ $$10 = 101_3=22_4$$ $$178 = 454_6 =343_7 = 262_8$$ For example, $3=1\cdot 2^1 + 1\cdot 2^0=11_2$ is a binary palindrome. I strongly suspect that a solution for four consecutive bases does not exits, but I do not know how to prove this observation. For comparison, there are infinitely many numbers that are palindromic in $3$ consecutive number bases. Almost $4$ consecutive bases Lets examine numbers which are ""almost palindromic in four consecutive bases"" . That is, the numbers palindromic in bases $b$ and $b+3$ , and in either $b+1$ or $b+2$ number base. Checking separately some $d$ digit palindromes up to some number base $b$ , I found: ( $b\le6000$ ) For $2$ digits, there are no examples. ( $b\le900$ ) For $3$ digits, there are $1484$ examples . ( $b\le800$ ) For $4$ digits, there is only one example at $b=10$ . ( $b\le150$ ) For $5$ digits, only two examples at $b=16$ and at $b=17$ ( $b\le100$ ) For $6$ digits, there are no examples. And etc. Notice that other than the three exceptions, all other palindromes (examples) of this type have exactly $3$ digits in their palindromic bases. If we can prove this observation, then our solution should have exactly $3$ digits in its palindromic bases. This in fact would solve the problem, because $3$ digit numbers cannot be palindromic in more than $3$ consecutive number bases. That is, Two smallest three digit numbers that are a palindrome in three consecutive are: $$178 = 454_6 =343_7 = 262_8$$ $$300 = 606_7 = 454_8 = 363_9$$ All other three digit palindromes which are palindromic in three consecutive number bases are given by (Also mentioned in the OEIS sequence) the following expression using $n\ge7$ and is odd : $$\frac{1}{2}(n^3 + 6n^2 + 14n + 11)$$ Each term given by this is palindromic in bases $n+1, n+2, n+3$ and is $3$ digits long. $373$ is the first number given by this equation, and is palindromic in bases $8,9,10$ . This three digit pattern will never extend to a fourth consecutive base as TMM said in the comments; which Ross Millikan posted later in his partial answer. It remains to prove the observation that ""almost 4 consecutive base palindromes"" can't have more than $3$ digits if they are sufficiently large.

16,Fermat's Last Theorem near misses?,Fermat's Last Theorem near misses?,,"I've recently seen a video of Numberphille channel on Youtube about Fermat's Last Theorem. It talks about how there is a given ""solution"" for the Fermat's Last Theorem for $n>2$ in the animated series The Simpsons. Thanks to Andrew Wiles, we all know that's impossible. The host tells that the solution that appears in the episode is actually a near miss. There are two near-miss solutions and they are: $$3987^{12} + 4365^{12} \stackrel{?}{=} 4472^{12}$$ $$1782^{12} + 1841^{12} \stackrel{?}{=} 1922^{12}$$ Anyone who knows modular arithmetic can check that those solutions are wrong, even without a calculator. You can check that $87^{12} \equiv 81 \pmod{100}$ and $65^{12} \equiv 25 \pmod {100}$ , while $72^{12} \equiv 16 \pmod {100}$ . So we have: $$ 81 + 25 \stackrel{?}{\equiv} 16 \pmod {100} $$ $$ 106 \stackrel{?}{\equiv} 16 \pmod {100} $$ which is obviously wrong. For the second example it's even easier. We know that LHS is an addition of an even and odd number, and the RHS is even number, which is impossible, because we know that the addition of an even and an odd number will provide an odd number. But what's made me most interested in this is the following. Using a calculator I expanded the equations and I get: $$3987^{12} + 4365^{12} \stackrel{?}{=} 4472^{12}$$ $$63976656349698612616236230953154487896987106 \stackrel{?}{=} 63976656348486725806862358322168575784124416$$ $$1211886809373872630985912112862690 \stackrel{?}{=} 0$$ And you'll immediately conclude that those numbers aren't even close, their difference is a 33-digit number. But bearing in mind that we are working with really, really big numbers, it's probably better to take relative difference. So we really want to find the ratio of LHS and RHS: $$ \frac{63976656349698612616236230953154487896987106}{63976656348486725806862358322168575784124416} \approx 1.00000000002 $$ Somehow that's impressive, but if take a look into the second example the things start to get more interesting: $$ 1782^{12} + 1841^{12} \stackrel{?}{=} 1922^{12} $$ $$ 2541210258614589176288669958142428526657 \stackrel{?}{=} 2541210259314801410819278649643651567616 $$ As we can see the first 9 digits are exactly the same and the apsolute difference is: $700212234530608691501223040959$ .

The proof of Mordell's theorem and the proof of Dirichlet's theorem are somewhat similar (a covolume calculation in one case, and what feels to me like bounding a covolume in the other). How can these two objects be realized as instances of the same construction?  Could it be done so well as to reduce the proof of Mordell-Weil and Dirichlet's theorems to a single proof? In the correspondence between the class number formula and the conjectured formula for the leading term of $L(E/\mathbf Q, s)$ , it appears that $\mathcal O_K^\times$ really does play the role of $E(\mathbf Q)$ (regulator corresponds to regulator, torsion to torsion). From my understanding, the general belief is that these two objets are analogous. But I'm having a hard time putting them on the same footing. In fact, there is a generalization of the Birch & Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture to any abelian variety over $\mathbf Q$, but in this case the conjectured leading term of the $L$-function is symmetric in $A$ and $\breve{A}$ (where $\breve{A}$ is the dual abelian variety). This conjecture degenerates to the BSD conjecture in the case of an elliptic curve, which is self-dual. But $\mathcal O^\times$ isn't an abelian variety.

I don't really know much about sieves, but I became intrigued when I read over the notes on Brun's Sieve . I remember hearing Chen's result that there are infinitely primes $p$ such that $p+2$ is either a near-prime (i.e. the product of two primes) or prime, but I've never pursued its proof. In these notes on Brun's Sieve, an exercise is assigned that is similar in spirit, though (almost certainly) much easier and direct (I paraphrase a little): The Task Use Brun's Sieve to show that there are infinitely many primes $p$ such that $p+2$ is the product of at most $20$ primes. I couldn't manage to solve this exercise (in fact, I got a bit lost). So I opened up my Iwaniec-Kowalski, which I believe may be where this problem was sourced for MIT's OCW.

But I still wasn't able to provide a proof. I'm aware that it hinges around the idea of considering a sequence/arithmetic function $$ a_n = \begin{cases} 1 & n + 2 \text{ is prime} \\ 0 & \text{else}\end{cases}$$ and then, apparently, sieving using Brun's Sieve on the interval $[1,x]$ excluding primes on $[1, x^{1/20}]$ . When I try to perform the sieving, I get caught up in circular arguments concerning what MIT's notes and I-K both call $V(z)$ , so I must be parsing things incorrectly. But I also highly suspect that this is a very straightforward exercise. My immediate goal is twofold: Learn how to use Brun's Sieve to do the above task, and See how far we can push Brun's Sieve to get similar results for $p+2$ as the product of fewer than $20$ primes. If you happen to be very familiar with these sieves, I would also be interested in knowing why one might use Brun's Sieve as opposed to, say, Selberg's Sieve (which was recently put to good use by Yitang Zhang).

40,How does one see Hecke Operators as helping to generalize Quadratic Reciprocity?,How does one see Hecke Operators as helping to generalize Quadratic Reciprocity?,,"My question is really about how to think of Hecke operators as helping to generalize quadratic reciprocity. Quadratic reciprocity can be stated like this: Let $\rho: Gal(\mathbb{Q})\rightarrow GL_1(\mathbb{C})$ be a $1$ -dimensional representation that factors through $Gal(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{W})/\mathbb{Q})$ . Then for any $\sigma \in Gal(\mathbb{Q})$ , $\sigma(\sqrt{W})=\rho(\sigma)\sqrt{W}$ . Define for each prime number $p$ an operator on the space of functions from $(\mathbb{Z}/4|W|\mathbb{Z})^{\times}$ to $\mathbb{C}^{\times}$ by $T(p)$ takes the function $\alpha$ to the function that takes $x$ to $\alpha(\frac{x}{p})$ . Then there is a simultaneous eigenfunction $\alpha$ , with eigenvalue $a_p$ for $T(p)$ , such that for all $p\not|4|W|$ $\rho(Frob_p)=a_p$ . (and to relate it to the undergraduate-textbook-version of quadratic reciprocity, one need only note that $\rho(Frob_p)$ is just the Legendre symbol $\left( \frac{W}{p}\right)$ .) Now I'm trying to understand how people think of generalizations of this. First, still in the one dimensional case, let's say we are not working over a quadratic field. What would the generalization be? What would take the place of $4|W|$ ? Would the space of functions that the $T(p)$ 's work on still thes space of functions from $(\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^{\times}$ to $\mathbb{C}^{\times}$ ? What is this $N$ ? Now let's jump to the $2$ -dimensional case. Here we have the actual theory of Hecke operators. However, as I understand it, there is a basis of simultaneous eigenvalues only for the cusp forms. Now I'm finding it hard to match everything up: are we dealing just with irreducible $2$ -dimensional representations? Instead of $\rho$ do we take the character? Would we say that for each representation there's a cusp form such that it's a simultaneous eigenfunction and such that $\xi(Frob_p)=a_p$ (the eigenvalues) where $\xi$ is the character of $\rho$ ?

Now in the cases when the genus is $g = 0$ or $g = 1$ we can have an infinite number of $K$-rational points in the curve, but then Mordell's conjecture says that when the genus goes on to the next higher value $g \geq 2$ then this can no longer happen and we can only have a finite number of $K$-rational points lying on the curve (if there are any). The usual topological interpretation that one sees mentioned in the books when they talk about the genus is as the number of holes in the surface $X(\mathbb{C})$. Thus I was just wondering if there's some way to see intuitively or at least without having to resort to highly technical arguments using scheme theory why this happens? To be more specific, is there a way to see intuitively how the fact that the surface $X(\mathbb{C})$ has more than one hole (when the genus is greater than one) prevents the corresponding algebraic curve from having an infinite number of $K$-rational points? Note: If it helps to ease things at least a little bit, I would be more than happy with an argument for the case when $K = \mathbb{Q}$ the set of rational numbers.

52,What is the sum of sum of digits of $4444^{4444^{4444}}$?,What is the sum of sum of digits of ?,4444^{4444^{4444}},"A recent question asked about the sum of sum of sum of digits of $4444^{4444}$. The solution there works mainly because the number chosen is small enough for the sum of sum of sum to be equal to the repeated sum: i.e. if we sum digits further, the result does not change. Since finding repeated sums of digits is just a matter of elementary number theory, this solves the problem. It seems the following question might be much harder: what is the sum of sum of digits of $$4444^{4444^{4444}}?$$ In other words, let $f:\Bbb N_0\to\Bbb N_0$ be the function defined by $f(n)=\textrm{sum of decimal digits of }n$. What is the value of $f\left(f\left(4444^{4444^{4444}}\right)\right)$? In this question, we have not yet reached a single-digit number, which at least seems to make it much harder. Some estimates: the number of decimal digits of $4444^{4444^{4444}}$ is equal to $$\left\lfloor\log_{10}4444^{4444^{4444}}\right\rfloor+1,$$ which implies $$f\left(4444^{4444^{4444}}\right)\le9\left(\log_{10}4444^{4444^{4444}}+1\right).$$ Next, the number of digits of this last number is at most $$\left\lfloor\log_{10}\left(9\left(\log_{10}4444^{4444^{4444}}+1\right)\right)\right\rfloor+1,$$ which is $16213$, according to Wolfram|Alpha . Therefore, $$f\left(f\left(4444^{4444^{4444}}\right)\right)\leq9\cdot16213=145917.$$ So the number we are looking for has at most $6$ digits. This makes it very feasible to express in decimal notation, but possibly hard to find.

I enjoy doing numerical computations on my leisure time, and at the end of the last summer, I was working on some personal routines related to the world of ISC . With the help of these pieces of code, I detected algorithmically several identities, among which the following one $$ \tanh z = \operatorname*{K}_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1 + \left((n-1) \frac{\pi}{4} z^{-1}\right)^2}{(2n-1) \frac{\pi}{4} z^{-1}} \tag{1} \label{1} $$ The previous notation is the one I use; I find it convenient and it can be found for instance in Continued Fractions with Applications by  Lorentzen & Waadeland, but I know that some people don't like it; it has to be read the following way: $$ a_0 + \operatorname*{K}_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{b_n}{a_n} = a_0 + \cfrac{b_1}{a_1 + \cfrac{b_2}{a_2 + \cfrac{b_3}{a_3 + \dotsb}}} $$ This continued fraction is nice when used for computing the hyperbolic tangent of numbers like $\pi/4$ and other simple multiples of $\pi$ since it will only involve integer numbers in the expansion of the continued fraction. Of course I browsed a little in order to see what was known about it, for example here , but I didn't find anything similar. I also sent it to several professional mathematicians, who told me that it could be difficult to recognize easily whether this continued fraction was equivalent to some other identity or not. I haven't myself the required skills to study further this expression, but I would be very happy to know more about it: is it something well-known? Is it something that comes trivially from some other identity? Is it (who knows?) something new? Edit 1: I posted myself an answer to the question by thinking something new was found; but it happened to be related to the precision in the computation. For that reason I may delete this answer in the future. Edit 2: In this edit I am going to explain more how I came up with the identity and to add a code that can be used to test the identity. I will not post my C code here because it is too long but I can really share it if someone wants it. Basically: I coded in the end of last summer a program in C computing very quickly millions of random continued fractions; each one was computed up to its 36th convergent; convergence was checked by looking at the difference between 35th and 36th convergent. Any quadratic value was discarded as not interesting for my purpose. Remaining values were matched against all non-quadratic values in Shamos's catalogue of real numbers by computing the PSLQ vector for $[z,1,S]$ (where $z$ was a continued fraction and $S$ a number from Shamos's book). I used a personal hygienic C macro for the pslq algorithm that I share here . The precision when computing the PSLQ algorithm on double-precision numbers was ""poor"" (about 12 digits) but I focused on speed for this project. Whenever an interesting result was returned by the PSLQ algorithm (low norm of the returned vector), the continued fraction was computed a second time with the dd type from D.H. Bailey's libqd library (about 32 exact digits only but much quicker than any arbitrary precision library; furthermore precision in Shamos's book is only 20 digits). If the coefficients previously returned by the PSLQ algorithm were able to find again the relation with at least 17 exact digits, current parameters were printed. I made this program run for several weeks on three cores of a Raspberry Pi 2 (which is rather slow but which can compute long tasks without getting warm). Results had to be later generalized ""by hand"" when similar values were noticed by me. What I finally got was much more than I could expect. Above is one of these results.

It is conjectured that there are infinitely many Wilson Primes. However, if there exists a fourth Wilson prime $p$ , then $p>2 \cdot 10^{13}$ . When $c \geqslant 3$ There are no known primes for which $p^3 \mid (p-1)!+1$ as if there is, then $p$ also has to be a Wilson Prime. $(5-1)!+1 = 25 \equiv 25 \pmod{5^3}$ $(13-1)!+1 = 479001601 \equiv 676 \pmod{13^3}$ $(563-1)!+1 \equiv 91921010 \pmod{563^3}$ It is most likely due to following evidence that there exists an upper bound $M$ for which: $$c \geqslant M \implies p^c \nmid (p-1)!+1$$ where $M \geqslant 3$ . We consider $(p-1)!+1 \pmod{p^c}$ We assume that every remainder divisible by $p$ (Wilson's Theorem) is equally probable. Thus, the probability of required remainder $0$ is $\frac{1}{p^{c-1}}$ Thus, probable number of primes for given constant $c$ is: $$\sum{\frac{1}{p^{c-1}}} = P(c-1)$$ where $P(x)$ is the Prime Zeta Function When $c=2$ , the expected number of Wilson primes is $P(1)$ . $$P(1)=\sum{\frac{1}{p}}$$ This sum is divergent. Thus, it is probable that there exist infinitely many Wilson primes. Proof: Define $N(x)$ to be the number of positive integers $n \leqslant x$ for which $p_i \nmid n$ , where $i > j$ for constant $j$ and $p_i$ is the $i$ th smallest prime. Then, we write: $$n=k^2m$$ where $m$ is square-free. As $m$ is square-free, and the only primes that divide it are $p_i$ for $1 \leqslant i \leqslant j$ , it has $2^j$ possibilities. $n^2 \leqslant x \implies n \leqslant \sqrt{x}$ , thus giving $n$ a maximum of $\sqrt{x}$ possibilities. $$\implies N(x) \leqslant 2^j\sqrt{x}$$ Assume the contrary, then for some $j$ : $$\sum_{i=j+1}^\infty \frac{1}{p_i} < \frac{1}{2}$$ We also have $x-N(x)$ is the number of numbers less than or equal to $x$ divisible by one or more of $p_i$ for $i>j$ . $$x-N(x) \leqslant \sum_{i=j+1}^\infty \frac{x}{p_i} < \frac{x}{2}$$ $$\implies 2^j\sqrt{x} > \frac{x}{2}$$ which is untrue for $x \geqslant 2^{2j+2}$ Thus the sum diverges. The divergence is similar to $\log{\log{x}}$ (Which is very slow). Probable Answer To Problem When $c \geqslant 3$ , the sum converges and is less than $1$ . When $c=3$ , $P(c-1) \approx 0.45$ When $c=4$ , $P(c-1) \approx 0.17$ When $c=5$ , $P(c-1) \approx 0.07$ When $c=6$ , $P(c-1) \approx 0.03$ When $c=7$ , $P(c-1) \approx 0.002$ We now go on to show why there most probably exists a constant $M$ such as the one in the problem. Consider: $$\sum_{i=3}^\infty P(i-1)$$ We have: $$\sum_{i=3}^\infty P(i-1) < \sum{\frac{1}{n(n+1)}} = \sum{\biggl(\frac{1}{n}-\frac{1}{n+1}\biggl)} = 1$$ Thus, the probable sum of the number of primes that satisfy the statement for $c \geqslant 3$ , including a prime $p$ , $n-2$ times, if the maximum $c$ satisfied is $n$ , is less than $1$ . However, if the answer to the problem is false, then, the sum would be infinite. Thus, it is highly unlikely for there to be a solution for $c \geqslant 3$ as the probable answer is less than $1$ but the actual answer would be a positive integer.

More specifically, can we, for some carefully chosen $k$ , leave out a chosen number of largest factors. In other words, given an integer $t>0$ does there exist a natural number $k$ such that $$\frac{(2k-t)!}{(k!)^2}\in\Bbb{Z}?$$ My curiosity about this comes from a question we had in May .

As we have that slack one might expect this to be possible. But I'm not sure. One obstruction comes from primes just below $k$ .

89,Colossally abundant numbers and the Riemann hypothesis,Colossally abundant numbers and the Riemann hypothesis,,"[This question has lead me to ask a follow up on MathOverflow .] A recent tweet by John Baez has reminded me of the astonishing fact $^1$ that the Riemann hypothesis (RH) can be disproved by finding a number $n > 5040$ such that $$\frac{\sigma(n)}{n \ln\ln n} > e^\gamma \;,$$ where $\gamma$ is Euler's constant. We can take the logarithms and introduce a function $$s(n) = \ln \frac{\sigma(n)}{n \ln\ln n}$$ such that the bound becomes $s(n) > \gamma$ . This is convenient, because if we know the prime factorisation $n = \prod_{q} q^{k_q}$ of a candidate number, we can rather easily compute $$s(n) = \sum_{q} \ln \frac{q^{k_q+1} - 1}{q - 1} - \sum_{q} k_q \ln q - \ln\ln \sum_{q} k_q \ln q \;,$$ without too much numerical trouble. $^2$ Now, it has been shown that if the RH is false, the inequality will fail to hold for a colossally abundant number . These were introduced by Alaoglu & Erdős (1944) and are defined such that $n$ is colossally abundant if and only if there is $\epsilon > 0$ such that for all $k > 1$ $$\frac{\sigma(n)}{n^{1+\epsilon}} \ge \frac{\sigma(k)}{k^{1+\epsilon}} \;.$$ Importantly, their Theorem 10 gives a simple enumeration of the prime exponents of the colossally abundant number associated with a particular $\epsilon > 0$ , $$k_q(\epsilon) = \left\lfloor \frac{\ln \frac{q^{1+\epsilon}-1}{q^{\epsilon}-1}}{\ln q}\right\rfloor - 1 \;.$$ Since all we need to compute the function $s(n)$ are a large list of primes $q$ and their exponents $k_q$ , we can pick any $\epsilon > 0$ , for example at random, compute the complete list of nonzero $k_q(\epsilon)$ , and obtain $s(n)$ rather straightforwardly. The result of a random draw as function of $\epsilon$ is shown here: It seems to me as if the values $s(n)$ approach the bound in an almost perfectly exponential manner. The curve is noisy, but as far as I can tell only due to the floor function, since everything else appears perfectly smooth. In what way could specific values of $\epsilon > 0$ make the noise cross the bound to potentially disprove the RH? More to the point, I don't understand how the structure of the primes comes into play here. The expression in the floor function in $k_q(\epsilon)$ smoothly approaches unity for fixed $\epsilon$ and increasing $q$ , so for any $\epsilon$ there is a smallest prime $r$ such that that $k_q = 0$ for all $q \ge r$ . In which way can the primes conspire such that a small change $\delta\epsilon$ , not big enough to change $r$ , changes enough $k_q$ for $q < r$ to make a significant change to $s(n)$ ? Even more interestingly, we can ostensibly make the following observation: For $\epsilon < 0.01$ , the function $s(n)$ is monotonically increasing as $\epsilon$ approaches zero. If this were true, it would mean that the RH can be disproved with the limit $\epsilon \to 0$ of $s(n)$ alone (which is of course a very hard problem). This seems a very analytical problem however, and makes me wonder again how and where the structure of the primes matters in this. And just to make it perfectly clear: The question is not ""does this disprove the RH"". The question is ""how could this, in principle, disprove the RH"". $^1$ Astonishing, because I can understand the problem even though I know nothing about the RH. $^2$ If someone is interested in trying, note there is trouble in double precision once $\epsilon$ get to $10^{-9}$ . You can rewrite the function $s(n)$ to treat the many, many, many $k_q = 1$ for the largest primes separately, $$s(n) = \sum_{q \colon k_q>1} \ln \frac{q^{k_q+1} - 1}{q^{k_q} \, (q - 1)} + \sum_{q \colon k_q=1} \ln (1 + 1/q) - \ln\ln \sum_{q} k_q \ln q \;.$$ The often available log1p function further helps with $\log(1 + 1/q) = \operatorname{log1p}(1/q)$ .","[This question has lead me to ask a follow up on MathOverflow .] A recent tweet by John Baez has reminded me of the astonishing fact that the Riemann hypothesis (RH) can be disproved by finding a number such that where is Euler's constant.

There is a string of numbers, and each player extends the string by appending a number to the end based on the current last number of the string. The string starts as the single number $1.$ If the last number of the string is $x,$ the player can append $2x+1,2x+5,$ or $\lfloor \frac{x}{3} \rfloor.$ The goal is to repeat a number already in the string. Here's an example game: $1, 7, 2, 9, 19,$ 43 $, 14, 33, 11,$ 3 $, 1.$ The first player was trapped. The italicized number is the trapped player's mistake, the moves after that by the trapped player before the bolded number are forced moves (by forced moves I mean if the trapped player plays anything else, the other player wins on the next turn), and the bolded number is basically the player trapped resigning. In the general case, is it guaranteed that somebody wins with perfect play, or would two perfect players battle forever?

There is a string of numbers, and each player extends the string by appending a number to the end based on the current last number of the string. The string starts as the single number If the last number of the string is the player can append or The goal is to repeat a number already in the string. Here's an example game: 43 3 The first player was trapped. The italicized number is the trapped player's mistake, the moves after that by the trapped player before the bolded number are forced moves (by forced moves I mean if the trapped player plays anything else, the other player wins on the next turn), and the bolded number is basically the player trapped resigning.

98,Trigonometric diophantine equation $8\sin^2\left(\frac{(k+1)\pi}{n}\right)=n\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{n}\right)$,Trigonometric diophantine equation,8\sin^2\left(\frac{(k+1)\pi}{n}\right)=n\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{n}\right),"Background. I thought up the problem of finding a regular $n$-sided polygon that has a diagonal with length $d_k$ such that the area of the polygon equals ${d_k}^2$. (Let $d_k$ denote the length of a diagonal that skips $k$ vertices, so that $d_0$ is the length of a side.) By doing some trigonometry I got the equation $$8\sin^2\left(\frac{(k+1)\pi}{n}\right)=n\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{n}\right).$$ I have checked some values of $n$ and it seems that $(4,0)$ and $(12,3)$ are the only (primitive and non-trivial) possible values for $(n,k)$. Question. Are there other solutions? One approach could be rewriting the equation using $\sin(x)=\frac i2(e^{-ix}-e^{ix})$. This gives $$4(\zeta_n^{k+1}+\zeta_n^{-k-1})-in(\zeta_n+\zeta_n^{-1})=8,$$ where $\zeta_n=e^{2\pi i/n}$. Update. Except for $n=4$, we have $n=4p$ with $p\equiv3\pmod4$ prime. Furthermore, $\gcd(n,k+1)=4$. See my answer below. Thanks to user dinoboy for the suggested technique.","Background.
