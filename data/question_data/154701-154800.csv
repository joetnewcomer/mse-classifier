4,What is the Prime at Infinity?,What is the Prime at Infinity?,,"I've been watching Alex Kontorovich's lectures on Analytic number theory, and he often references a ""prime at infinity"" or a similar sounding concept.

I can't find the specific quote where he says this (as it would involve re-watching multiple hours of lectures,) however here's roughly what he said. Suppose we wrote $\xi(s)$ as follows: $$\xi(s)=\pi^{-\tfrac{s}{2}}\Gamma(\frac{s}{2})\prod_{p\text{ prime}}(1-p^{-s})^{-1}$$ He refers to the factors in the infinite product coming from each prime (which makes sense) and the $\pi^{-\tfrac{s}{2}}\Gamma(\frac{s}{2})$ factor coming from the prime at infinity.

In particular, Ramanujan's does the following comparison in step (8): $$\ln\Gamma(x) - 2\ln\Gamma(\frac{x}{2} + \frac{1}{2}) \le \ln(\lfloor{x}\rfloor!) - 2\ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{2}\rfloor!)$$ It occurs to me that this can be generalized to: $$\ln\Gamma(\frac{x}{b_1}) - \ln\Gamma(\frac{x}{b_2} + \frac{1}{2}) - \ln\Gamma(\frac{x}{b_3} + \frac{1}{2})\le \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{b_1}\rfloor!) - \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{b_2}\rfloor!) - \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{b_3}\rfloor!)$$ when: $$\frac{x}{b_1} = \frac{x}{b_2} + \frac{x}{b_3}$$ I would really appreciate it if my argument could be reviewed and someone could call out any mistakes either in the answer or in comments.  :-) Here's the argument for this generalization: Let: $$\{\frac{x}{b_i}\} = \frac{x}{b_i} - \lfloor\frac{x}{b_i}\rfloor$$ where: $$0 \le \{\frac{x}{b_i}\} < 1$$ Since: $$\{\frac{x}{b_1}\} + \lfloor\frac{x}{b_1}\rfloor = \{\frac{x}{b_2}\} + \lfloor\frac{x}{b_2}\rfloor + \{\frac{x}{b_3}\} + \lfloor\frac{x}{b_3}\rfloor$$ We have: $$\{\frac{x}{b_1}\} \le \{\frac{x}{b_2}\} + \{\frac{x}{b_3}\}$$ So that: $$-\{\frac{x}{b_1}\} \ge -\{\frac{x}{b_2}\} + -\{\frac{x}{b_3}\}$$ $$2-\{\frac{x}{b_1}\} \ge 1-\{\frac{x}{b_2}\} + 1-\{\frac{x}{b_3}\}$$ $$1-\{\frac{x}{b_1}\} \ge 1-\{\frac{x}{b_2}\} - \frac{1}{2} + 1-\{\frac{x}{b_3} \} - \frac{1}{2}$$ $$\lfloor\frac{x}{b_1}\rfloor + 1 - \frac{x}{b_1} \ge (\lfloor\frac{x}{b_2}\rfloor + 1 - \frac{x}{b_2} - \frac{1}{2}) + (\lfloor\frac{x}{b_3}\rfloor + 1 - \frac{x}{b_3} - \frac{1}{2})$$ $$\lfloor\frac{x}{b_1}\rfloor + 1 \ge (\lfloor\frac{x}{b_2}\rfloor + 1) + (\lfloor\frac{x}{b_3}\rfloor + 1)$$ If $\Delta{t_1} \ge \Delta{t_2} + \Delta{t_3}$ and $x_1 + \Delta{t_1} \ge x_2 + \Delta{t_2} \ge x_3 + \Delta{t_3} > 0$, Using the logic in the answer here : $$\frac{\Gamma(x_1 + \Delta{t_1})}{\Gamma(x_1)} \ge \frac{\Gamma(x_2 + \Delta{t_2})}{\Gamma(x_2)}\frac{\Gamma(x_3 + \Delta{t_3})}{\Gamma(x_3)}$$ Let: $x_1 = \frac{x}{b_1}$,  $\Delta{t_1} = 1 - \{\frac{x}{b_1}\}$, $x_2 = \frac{x}{b_2}+\frac{1}{2}$,  $\Delta{t_2} = \frac{1}{2} - \{\frac{x}{b_2}\}$ $x_3 = \frac{x}{b_3}+\frac{1}{2}$,  $\Delta{t_3} = \frac{1}{2} - \{\frac{x}{b_3}\}$ where $\frac{x}{b_2} \ge \frac{x}{b_3}$ (Otherwise, switch the two values). Then: $$\frac{\Gamma(\lfloor\frac{x}{b_1}\rfloor+1)}{\Gamma(\frac{x}{b_1})} \ge \frac{\Gamma(\lfloor\frac{x}{b_2}\rfloor+1)}{\Gamma(\frac{x}{b_2} + \frac{1}{2})}\frac{\Gamma(\lfloor\frac{x}{b_3}\rfloor+1)}{\Gamma(\frac{x}{b_3}+\frac{1}{2})}$$ So then it follows: $$\ln\Gamma(\lfloor\frac{x}{b_1}\rfloor + 1) - \ln\Gamma(\frac{x}{b_1}) \ge \ln\Gamma(\lfloor\frac{x}{b_2}\rfloor + 1) - \ln\Gamma(\frac{x}{b_2} + \frac{1}{2}) + \ln\Gamma(\lfloor\frac{x}{b_3}\rfloor + 1) - \ln\Gamma(\frac{x}{b_3} + \frac{1}{2})$$ And we have shown: $$\ln\Gamma(\frac{x}{b_1}) - \ln\Gamma(\frac{x}{b_2}+\frac{1}{2}) - \ln\Gamma(\frac{x }{b_3}+\frac{1}{2}) \le \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{b_1}\rfloor!) - \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{b_2}\rfloor!) - \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{b_3}\rfloor!)$$ Please let me know if you see any mistakes. Thanks, -Larry Edit: Based on reviewing Zander's answer, I believe that this argument can be saved.

17,How many factors a number has,How many factors a number has,,I've been wondering how  just adding 1 to a number affects the number of factors.  12 has 6 factors (quite a lot)  but 13 is prime ( I think of 12 as being a sort of factor instability).  On the other hand 14 'resists' change because it has the same number of factors as 15.  23 is prime but 24 has lots of factors as if there is something about 23 that allows the number of factors to dramatically increase.  Clearly the number of factors can increase  an increasing instability or decrease a decreasing stability or resisting stability.  I'd like to know what the proportion of each type of number is. Are there equal numbers of stable and unstable or not? What's the most consecutive stable numbers it is possible to have? It's just interest nothing more.

I had a follow-up question of my own: Starting with the simplest kind of function field, i.e. $\mathbb F_q(T)$ where $q$ is a prime, we can calculate the zeta function over the ring $\mathbb F_q[T]$ to be:$$\Gamma_{\mathbb F_q[T]}(s)=\sum_{\mathfrak a \neq 0}N\mathfrak a^{-s}=\sum_{d=0}^\infty q^d(q^d)^{-s}=1/(1-q^{1-s})$$ In order to write down a functional equation, I need to include a local factor corresponding to the infinite place. My question is: How to do that correctly, in the machinery used in Tate's thesis, and without direct recourse to the Riemann-Roch theorem? I know the answer I am looking to get to is this:$$\xi(s)=\frac{q^{-s}}{(1-q^{-s})(1-q^{1-s})}$$ I can get part of this.

36,Fermat's 2 Square-Like Results from Minkowski Lattice Proofs,Fermat's 2 Square-Like Results from Minkowski Lattice Proofs,,"Minkowski's Convex Body Theorem for lattices in the plane: Suppose $\mathfrak{L}$ is a lattice in $\mathbf{R}^2$ defined as $\mathfrak{L}=\{m\vec{v_1}+n\vec{v_2}:m,n\in\mathbf{Z}\}$ , where $\vec{v_1}$ and $\vec{v_2}$ are linearly independent. Suppose $d$ is the area of a fundamental parallelogram of $\mathfrak{L}$ . Then, if $\mathcal{S}$ is a convex and origin-symmetric region with $Area(\mathcal{S})>4d$ , then $\mathcal{S}$ contains some point $q\neq 0$ such that $q\in\mathfrak{L}$ . There is a particularly nice proof of Fermat's two square theorem - an odd prime $p$ is expressible as $x^2+y^2$ for $x,y\in\mathbf{Z}$ $\iff$ $p\equiv 1\pmod{4}$ - using this fact. Here is my proof below: Choose $a\in\mathbf{Z}$ such that $p|a^2+1$ . Now, let $\mathfrak{L}$ be a lattice in $\mathbf{R}^2$ defined as $\mathfrak{L}=\{m\vec{v_1}+n\vec{v_2}:m,n\in\mathbf{Z}\}$ where $\vec{v_1}=(a,1)$ and $\vec{v_2}=(p,0)$ . It is easy to see that a fundamental parallelogram $\mathfrak{F}$ of $\mathfrak{L}$ has area $p$ . Now, suppose $(x,y)\in\mathfrak{L}$ . Then we have $x=ma+np, y=m$ , so \begin{align*}x^2+y^2 &= (ma+np)^2 + m^2 \\ &= m^2a^2+2manp+n^2p^2+m^2\\ &= m^2(a^2+1) + 2manp + n^2p^2 \\ &\equiv m^2(a^2+1)\pmod{p} \\ &\equiv 0\pmod{p} \end{align*} due to our choice of $a$ . Now, let $\mathfrak{C}$ be an $O$ -symmetric circle with radius $\sqrt{2p}$ , so $\mathfrak{C}=\{(x,y)\in\mathbf{R}^2 : x^2+y^2<2p\}$ Then $$Area(\mathfrak{C})=2p\pi > 4p = 4\cdot Area(\mathfrak{F}).$$ Thus, by Minkowski, $\exists$ a lattice point $(j,k)\in\mathfrak{C}\setminus (0,0)$ . By the above work, $p|j^2+k^2$ , and by definition of $\mathfrak{C}$ , $j^2+k^2<2p$ . Moreover, $j^2+k^2$ is positive, so $0<j^2+k^2<2p$ , but in order for $j^2+k^2$ to be divisible by $p$ , we must have $p=j^2+k^2$ , so we are done.

Then simplifying and rearranging the equation gives $$20a^3 = 2^2 \cdot 5 \cdot a^3 = b^3+1 = (b+1)(b^2-b+1).$$ Note that neither factors can be divisible by $3$, since both of them must be divisible by $3$ but $b^2-b+1 \not \equiv 0 \pmod{9}$ and $b^2-b+1 = 3$ gives a contradiction. Also since $b$ is odd, then $b+1$ is even and $b^2-b+1$ is odd. Also, $b^2-b+1 \not \equiv 0 \pmod{5}$, so $b+1 \equiv 0 \pmod{20}$. Then since $$\gcd(b+1,b^2-b+1) = \gcd(b+1,-2b+1) = \gcd(b+1,3),$$ it follows that $(b+1)$ and $(b^2-b+1)$ are relatively prime.

Then since two solutions for $(a,b)$ are $(0,-1)$ and $(7,19)$ I wanted to show that $(b+1) \mid 20$, or equivalently that $a$ and $b+1$ are relatively prime. So suppose that for some prime $p$ we have $a \equiv 0 \pmod{p}$ and $b+1 \equiv 0 \pmod{p}$. It then follows that $b+1 \equiv 0 \pmod{p^3}$, so that $b = p^3k-1$ for some integer $k$.

64,Conjecture: smallest missing mod value always yields previous prime,Conjecture: smallest missing mod value always yields previous prime,,"I've come up with a conjecture that seems similar in strength to Legendre's or Oppermann's, but maybe subtly different. Let $a_n$ be the smallest nonnegative value such that there is no $m$ in $1<m<n/2$ where $n \equiv a_n \pmod m$ . Then for all $n>2$ , we have $n-a_n=p_{\pi(n)-1}$ , the closest previous prime to $n$ . Take $n=16$ as an example: $$\begin{eqnarray} 16 &\equiv 0 \pmod 2 \\    &\equiv 1 \pmod 3 \\    &\equiv 0 \pmod 4 \\    &\equiv 1 \pmod 5 \\    &\equiv 4 \pmod 6 \\    &\equiv 2 \pmod 7 \end{eqnarray}$$ The smallest value not seen is $a_n=3$ , and $16-3=13$ is the previous prime. In cases where $n$ itself is prime, e.g. $17$ yielding the values $\{1,2,1,2,5,3,1\}$ , you can either interpret $0$ as the missing value and $17$ as the prime, or $4$ giving $17-4=13$ . (I'm not sure which is the more consistent interpretation.) I've verified this empirically through $10^5$ , but cannot come up with a proof.

94,Help with proving that $\pi$ is irrational,Help with proving that  is irrational,\pi,"I was trying to prove that $\pi$ is irrational, just to see if I could do it.

To do this, I thought I could use partial sums $S_n$ of $S$: $$S_n=\sum\limits_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k^2}=\frac{A_n}{B_n}$$ where the fraction $A_n/B_n$ is written in lowest terms. We can note that the sequence $\lbrace S_n \rbrace$ is a strictly increasing sequence, with $\pi^2/6$ as its lowest upper bound, so I thought that maybe the sequences $\lbrace A_n \rbrace$ and $\lbrace B_n \rbrace$ both have no upper bound, and the sequences would tend to infinity, and if I were able to prove this, I thought I could use it to argue that $S$ is an irrational number, using the fact that every rational number can be written as the quotient between two finite integers. We note that $A_n\geq B_n$ for all natural $n$, as $S_n\geq 1$, so all we would really need to prove in that case is that $\lbrace B_n \rbrace \rightarrow \infty$(if this assertion is even correct). At first I thought that both $\lbrace A_n \rbrace$ and $\lbrace B_n \rbrace$ would be increasing sequences, but after checking with Maple I noticed that they weren't, sadly enough($S_9=\frac{9778141}{6350400}$ and $S_{10}=\frac{1968329}{1270080}$).

For example, for $(a,b,c)=(F_{2n-1},F_{2n+1},F_{2n+3})$, we have $$\begin{align}\color{red}{ab+a+b-c}&=F_{2n-1}F_{2n+1}+F_{2n-1}+F_{2n+1}-F_{2n+3}\\&={F_{2n}}^2+1+F_{2n-1}-F_{2n+2}\\&={F_{2n}}^2+1-2F_{2n}\\&=\color{blue}{(F_{2n}-1)^2}\end{align}$$ $$\begin{align}\color{red}{bc+b+c-a}&=F_{2n+1}F_{2n+3}+F_{2n+1}+F_{2n+3}-F_{2n-1}\\&={F_{2n+2}}^2+1+F_{2n+3}+F_{2n}\\&={F_{2n+2}}^2+1+2F_{2n+2}\\&=\color{blue}{(F_{2n+2}+1)^2}\end{align}$$ $$\begin{align}\color{red}{ca+c+a-b}&=F_{2n+3}F_{2n-1}+F_{2n+3}+F_{2n-1}-F_{2n+1}\\&={F_{2n+1}}^2+1+F_{2n-1}+F_{2n+2}\\&={F_{2n+1}}^2+1+2F_{2n+1}\\&=\color{blue}{(F_{2n+1}+1)^2}\end{align}$$ So, here is my question. Question : Are the following propositions true? Proposition 1 (False) : For positive integers $(a,b,c)$ such that $a\not=b,b\not=c$ and $c\not=a$, if each of $$ab-1,\ bc-1,\ ca-1,\ ab-a-b+c,\ bc-b-c+a,\ ca-c-a+b$$   is a perfect square, then each of   $$ab+a+b-c,\ bc+b+c-a,\ ca+c+a-b$$   is a perfect square. Proposition 2 (True) : For positive integers $(a,b,c)$ such that $\color{red}{1\le} a\lt b\lt c$ and $ab+a+b-c\ge 0$, if each of $$ab-1,\ bc-1,\ ca-1,\ ab-a-b+c,\ bc-b-c+a,\ ca-c-a+b$$   is a perfect square, then each of   $$ab+a+b-c,\ bc+b+c-a,\ ca+c+a-b$$   is a perfect square. Proposition 3 : For positive integers $(a,b,c)$ such that $\color{red}{2\le} a\lt b\lt c$, if each of $$ab-1,\ bc-1,\ ca-1,\ ab-a-b+c,\ bc-b-c+a,\ ca-c-a+b$$   is a perfect square, then each of   $$ab+a+b-c,\ bc+b+c-a,\ ca+c+a-b$$   is a perfect square. Proposition 4 (True) : For positive integers $(a,b,c)$ such that $\color{red}{1\le} a\lt b\lt c$, if each of $$ab-1,\ bc-1,\ ca-1,\ ab\mp (a+ b-c),\ bc\mp (b+ c- a),\ ca\mp (c+ a-b)$$   is a perfect square, then $c=a+b+2\sqrt{ab-1}$ holds. Added : Proposition 1 is false because of $(a,b,c)=(1,5,65)$ found by Oleg567. Then, I added proposition 2 and 3. Also, I added proposition 4 (see Tito Piezas III's answer). Can anyone help? Update : I crossposted to MO . Added : Proposition 2 and 4 are true (see my answer for the details). However, we still don't know if proposition 3 is true.",,"['number-theory', 'fibonacci-numbers', 'square-numbers']"
