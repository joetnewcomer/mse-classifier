2,Showing a bijection between binary string sets.,Showing a bijection between binary string sets.,,"I am working on showing a bijection between two sets: $B^6$ and $E_{10}$ . Here is the problem: Let $B = {0, 1}$ . $B^n$ is the set of binary strings with $n$ bits. Define the set $E_n$ to be the set of binary strings with $n$ bits that have an even number of 1's. Note that zero is an even number, so a string with zero 1's (i.e., a string that is all 0's) has an even number of 1's. Show a bijection between $B^9$ and $E_{10}$ . Explain why your function is a bijection. Here is my answer: Suppose $x \in B^9$ . We know an odd number is the result of an even number plus an odd number. Since there are only 9 digits for each $x \in B^9$ , and 9 is an odd number, this means that if there are an odd number of 1’s in x then there will be an even number of 0’s in x. Further, if there are an even number of 1’s in x then there will be an odd number of 0’s in x. Therefore, each $x \in B^9$ will have either an odd or even amount of 1’s. We could write a function f to say that if x has an odd number of 1’s, then append a 1, which would give us an even number of 1’s. We could also say that if x has an even number of 1’s than append a 0, which would then keep the number of 1’s even. Assuming each $x \in B^9$ is unique, according to our function we will be adding either a 1 or a 0 to the end of the string, which would produce a new unique string with 10 bits. For example, $f(100011000)=1000110001$ . This means that the function is injective (one-to-one) function because each element in the domain is mapped to 1 distinct element in the codomain. We can also have an inverse function $f^{-1}$ which removes the last binary digit from each $y \in E_{10}$ . $E_{10}$ is defined to be the set where each element from $B^9$ has a 1 or 0 appended to it, and thus producing a distinct element. Removing the end 1 or 0 from this new string produces the distinct unique element that was in $B^9$ . For example, $f^{-1}(1000110001)=100011000$ . This means each element in $E_{10}$ can be mapped to at least one unique $x \in B^9$ , meaning the function is onto Since the function is both one-to-one and onto, then it is a bijection. I feel like there is a much simpler way of showing this, and not really sure if I made a good case in the first place. I was hoping someone could provide a different way to think about this problem or provide some insight so that I can formulate a better answer.

16,New wrong recurrence formula for Bell numbers,New wrong recurrence formula for Bell numbers,,"Bell numbers are the numbers counting the total partitions on a set with $n$ distinct elements. Explanation : Consider a set like $A:=\left\{x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n}\right\}$ A partial equivalence relation is either reflexive or it is not, so the number of partial equivalence relation on a set with cardinality $n$ is $B_n$ plus the relations which are partial equivalence relation but not reflexive, to make these relations we can consider that a set with $n$ element cannot be reflexive if at least one of the ordered pairs $(x_i,x_i)$ is not in that relation,so at first we can remove one of the ordered pairs $(x_i,x_i)$ $(0\le i\le n)$ and continue till we have $n-1$ ordered pair in the form $(x_i,x_i)$ removed (It cannot be $n$ because if we have $n$ ordered pairs then we are counting a relation which has been already counted by $B_n$ ) Also given these kind of the partial equivalence relation, they can be combined with each other to make another   equivalence relation that is not reflexive. For example for $A=\left\{1,2,3\right\}$ the total conditions that a partial equivalence relation is not reflexive is: $$\left\{\right\}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,{{3}\choose{0}}$$ $$\left\{\left(1,1\right)\right\}\left\{\left(2,2\right)\right\}\left\{\left(3,3\right)\right\}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,{{3}\choose{1}}$$ $$\left\{\left(11\right),\left(22\right)\right\}\left\{\left(1,1\right),\left(3,3\right)\right\}\left\{\left(2,2\right),\left(3,3\right)\right\}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,{{3}\choose{2}}$$ $$\left\{\left(11\right),\left(22\right),\left(12\right),\left(21\right)\right\}\left\{\left(1,1\right),\left(3,3\right),\left(13\right),\left(31\right)\right\}\left\{\left(2,2\right),\left(3,3\right),\left(23\right),\left(32\right)\right\}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,{{3}\choose{2}}{{2}\choose{2}}$$ The relations in the last row are made form combining the second and third row, the number of choosing $2$ element form the set $A$ is ${{3}\choose{2}}$ ( indeed the number of way to choose $2$ of these elements to make an ordered pair in the form $(x_i,x_i)$ ) and there is ${{2}\choose{2}}$ ways to make a new partial equivalence relation with the $2$ elements. If we sum the number of these kind of partial equivalence relations that are not reflexive with those partial equivalence relations which are reflexive we get : $$\color{blue}{9+B_3}=10+5=15=\color{blue}{B_4}$$ Which is indeed the number of partial equivalence relations on $A$ . I used this strategy and tried for $n=4$ , finally could derive the recurrence formula for Bell numbers: $$2^{n}-1+\sum_{k=2}^{n-1}\sum_{m=2}^{k}{{n}\choose{k}}{{k}\choose{m}}+B_n=B_{n+1}$$ Mapping $k-2\mapsto k$ and $m-2\mapsto m$ equivalently the formula can be rewritten as: $$2^{n}-1+\sum_{k=0}^{n-3}\sum_{m=0}^{k+2}{{n}\choose{k+2}}{{k+2}\choose{m+2}}+B_n=B_{n+1}$$ With the initial value $B_0=1$ the formula gives: $$0+B_{0}=0+1=\color{blue}{1}=\color{blue}{B_{1}}$$ $$1+B_{1}=1+1=\color{blue}{2}=\color{blue}{B_{2}}$$ $$3+B_{2}=3+2=\color{blue}{5}=\color{blue}{B_{3}}$$ $$10+B_{3}=10+5=\color{blue}{15}=\color{blue}{B_{4}}$$ $$37+B_{4}=37+15=\color{blue}{52}=\color{blue}{B_{5}}$$ $$136+B_{5}=136+52=\color{red}{188}\ne \color{red}{B_{6}}$$ The formula does not give the right number for $B_{6}$ , but I'm sure the validity of the other Bell numbers is not accidental, so why the formula gives such a wrong number? where I was wrong? Finally I should say that I came up with this calculation, because I cannot understand why the total number of partial equivalence relations on a set with cardinality $n$ is $B_{n+1}$ , so It would be really appreciated if someone explain that with more details.","Bell numbers are the numbers counting the total partitions on a set with distinct elements.

A unstable party is a group of people with a member who either doesn’t like another party member and has no friend to compensate, or has at least two persons that she doesn’t like in the same party A compact stable party is a stable party that for any people that not in the party, if we add him/her to the party, the party will become unstable.

37,Limiting distributions (attractors) associated with the discrete difference operator - application to error detection,Limiting distributions (attractors) associated with the discrete difference operator - application to error detection,,"Let $Z = (Z_1,Z_2,\cdots)$ be a sequence of real numbers, either deterministic or with the $Z_i$ 's being i.i.d. random variables. As usual, the successive discrete difference sequences are recursively defined as follows: $D_{0} = Z$ If $n\geq 0$ , then $D_{n+1} = (D_{n+1,1}, D_{n+1,2}, D_{n+1,3},\cdots)$ with $D_{n+1,k}=D_{n,k}-D_{n,k+1}$ . For a given $n$ , all $D_{n,i}$ 's have the same distribution. If the $Z_i$ 's are i.i.d, then $\mbox{E}(D_{n,i}) = 0$ if $n>0$ and $\mbox{Var}(D_{n,i})=\mbox{Var}(Z_1)\cdot (2n)!/(n!)^2$ . This is based on the fact that $$D_{n,i} =\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} Z_{k+i} .$$ Thus $$\mbox{Var}(D_{n,i})=\mbox{Var}(Z_1)\cdot\sum_{k=0}^n \Big(\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\Big)^2 =\mbox{Var}(Z_1)\cdot \frac{(2n)!}{(n!)^2}.$$ We define the normalized vector $C_n$ as $C_n = D_n/\sqrt{\mbox{Var}(D_{n,1})}$ . 1. Question Find at least one attractor distribution (also called limit distribution) $F$ such as when $n\rightarrow\infty$ , we have $P(C_{n,i} <z) \rightarrow F(z)$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$ . For a given $n$ , all $C_{n,i}$ 's have the same distribution. Of course $F$ may depend on $Z$ .  Note that the she support domain for $F$ is infinite, see section 4. 2. Experimentation I played with various deterministic sequences that look just like random variables, namely $Z_k = \{b^k \log 2\}$ where $b>1$ , and the brackets represent the fractional part function. Keep in mind that in this context, the $Z$ sequence is auto-correlated: the correlation between two successive values is equal to $1/b$ if $b$ is an integer, and lag- $m$ autocorrelation is equal to $1/b^m$ (so the autocorrelations are decaying exponentially fast). Below is the limit distribution obtained if $b=1.1$ . This is a non-standard case. The chart below features its empirical percentile distribution: And now the typical limit distribution (actually the percentile distribution) for a standard case, $b=3$ : It would be interesting to see what we obtain if $Z_k$ is uniform on $[0, 1]$ , or normal, assuming the $Z_i$ 's are i.i.d. this time. 3. Characteristic function It is easy to verify that the characteristic function of $C_{n,1}$ is given by $$\mbox{E}[\exp(itC_{n,1})] = \prod_{k=0}^n\mbox{E}\Big[\exp\Big(it (-1)^n \cdot \frac{n!\sqrt{(2n)!}}{k!(n-k)!n!} \cdot Z_k\Big)\Big]$$ where the $Z_k$ 's are i.i.d. and have same distribution as $Z_1$ . Thus is $Z_1$ has a stable distribution , then $C_{n,1}$ will have a distribution from the same family. This is the case if $Z_1$ has a normal distribution. 4. The support domain of the limiting distribution is infinite In order to prove this, let's focus on the maximum value for $D_{n,1}$ , assuming $Z_1$ is Bernouilli of parameter $1/2$ . The maximum is equal to $2^{n-1}$ . Also $C_{n,1}=D_{n,1}/\sqrt{\mbox{Var}(D_{n,1})} = (n!/\sqrt{(2n)!})\cdot D_{n,1}$ . Using the Stirling approximation for the factorials, the maximum for $C_{n,1}$ is thus of the order $n^{1/4}$ and tends to infinity as $n$ tends to infinity. The same logic can be used for the minimum. And to get a general proof, the final step is to consider an arbitrary distribution for $Z_1$ , rather than the Bernouilli. Some restrictions may apply on the distribution of $Z_1$ for this result to be valid in the general case. I tried with a uniform distribution on $[0, 1]$ for $Z_1$ , and at this stage it is still unclear to me if the support domain is infinite. In this case, it looks like $\max D_{n,1} \propto \alpha^n$ with $\alpha$ very close to $2$ , but possibly smaller. We need $\alpha = 2$ for the support domain of $C_{\infty,1}$ to be infinite. 5. Potential application Successive applications of the discrete difference operator are very useful to identify errors or outliers in a sequence of numbers, as these errors propagate exponentially fast across $D_n$ , as $n$ increases. The theory discussed here could lead to a statistical test to identify these errors. Specifically, the statistic of the test could be a combination of the following ratios: $$T_n =\frac{\mbox{Var}(D_{n+1,i})}{\mbox{Var}(D_{n,i})} = \frac{2(2n+1)}{n+1}, n = 0, 1, 2,\cdots.$$ Any departure from the expected value of $T_n$ , for $n=0, 1$ or $2$ , could suggest that there is some unexpected pattern in your data, or possibly that your data points are auto-correlated. Indeed, I noticed this effect when comparing i.i.d $Z_i$ 's with some that are auto-correlated, as in the examples pictured in this discussion (though the discrepancy tends to disappear as $n\rightarrow \infty$ ). Finally, keep in mind that as $n\rightarrow\infty$ , the lag- $m$ auto-correlation computed on the $C_{\infty}$ sequence is strong for $m<6$ . The table below gives a rough approximation. 6. Conclusions In many cases where $Z_1$ has a continuous distribution, it looks like the limiting distribution will be normal. If $Z_1$ has a discrete distribution, we have several possibilities, see below. Note that the references in the list below are not related to the difference operator, but rather to some other systems that produce the same kinds of limiting distributions. So, the various cases below apply to a large class of chaotic systems: it is a general summary for all these systems. The limiting distribution can be normal or some other regular smooth distribution, either well known or not The limiting distribution can look very smooth yet be differentiable nowhere, and yet very close to normal or related (see here , here , and here ) The limiting distribution can look very un-smooth The limiting distribution can be very peculiar, as in the fist chart    in this article, yet computable The limiting distribution can be a piecewise linear mix of uniform distributions or some other weird mix The limiting distribution can be very wild, totally chaotic as in the picture below (as if it was a Fourier series with a bunch of missing terms) not unlike the Weierstrass function .

However I thought that the movies are finite, and storing some would decrease the overall count each time you store them, something like a permutation/factorial. Why can I store the movies as if they refill/are constant? 2. How many ways are there to select where the movies will be stored if the same number of movies are stored at each server? Answer: ^ I am lost as to why factorials were used and what they represent. Now treating the movies as a finite resource compared to problem #1. Also confusing where the in the denominator came from.

The problem stated is: Let $X \sim Pascal(m,p)$ and $Y \sim Pascal(l,p)$ where X and Y are independent of each other. Let $Z = X + Y$ . Find PMF of Z. The textbook answer states that since the two random variables are independent we can think of Z as a pascal random variable where we want to see $m + l$ heads. So $Z \sim Pascal(m+l, p)$ The book doesn't give us an exact distribution, but Pascal(m+l, p) using the negative binomial formula has distribution $${k-1 \choose m+l-1}p^{m+l}(1-p)^{k-m-l}$$ However when I approached it before looking at the given solution, I didn't get the same same binomial coefficient.

92,When is the matrix $I-P$ nilpotent?,When is the matrix  nilpotent?,I-P,"Note: sorry for the long post. My question is in the second quote. A few years ago, I saw the following problem on Facebook. I would like to ask a generalised version of this problem. Here is the original problem: A number of people sits at a roundtable. Each of them puts a coin in front of them with either head or tail facing up. Each of them is going to flip the coin in front of them (or not flip the coin) according to the following rules: Each of them checks the coin in front of the person to the right. If the coin to the right is tail up, flip the coin in front to the other side; if the coin to the right is head up, do not flip the coin in front. This flipping is done simultaneously, that is, they simultaneously check the coin to the right, and simultaneously flip (or not flip) the coin in front. After flipping the coins, they can repeat the above checking and flipping again, and again, until possibly all coins end up with head up, which no more flipping will happen, or maybe they cannot end up with all coins head up at all. For what number of people $n$ would it happen that no matter initially the people put the coins tail up or head up, they will always end up with all coins head up after those flipping? The answer is when $n$ is a power of $2$ (except $2^0$ ). Here is how a found it: The simultaneous state of the coins (whether they are head up or tail up) is modelled by a column vector of $n$ entries, with each entry being $0$ or $1$ . Say we index each person as $1,2,\dots,n$ (a certain person is number $1$ , and the guy to the left is number $2$ , and the guy to the left of number $2$ is number $3$ , and so on, with the guy to the right of number $1$ is number $n$ ). The $i$ -th entry of the vector being $0$ means the coin in front of the $i$ -th guy is head up, while being $1$ means the coin is tail up. As a note, the entries are to be interpreted as elements in $\Bbb Z/2\Bbb Z$ . The checking and flipping process is modelled by the matrix $I+P$ , where $I$ is the $n\times n$ identity matrix, and $P$ is the $n\times n$ permutation matrix where the sub-diagonal entries are $1$ , the top-right entry is $1$ , and all else entries are $0$ . Again, $I+P$ is a matrix whose entries are elements in $\Bbb Z/2\Bbb Z$ . A round of checking and flipping is modelled by multiplying the matrix $I+P$ to the column vector modelling the states of coins. It takes some effort to realise that any initial vectors will end up becoming zero vector after multiplying $I+P$ enough of times, if and only if $I+P$ is nilpotent. So we are to find out for what $n$ is $I+P$ nilpotent. We try to square the matrix $I+P$ , and see that $(I+P)^2=I+2P+P^2=I+P^2$ because $2P$ is the zero matrix (the entries are from $\Bbb Z/2\Bbb Z$ ). We keep squaring to see $(I+P)^{2^m}=I+P^{2^m}$ . So we want $I+P^{2^m}=0$ for large enough $m$ , or equivalently $P^{2^m}=I$ ( $I=-I$ in $\Bbb Z/2\Bbb Z$ ). We know that this is possible if and only if $n$ is a power of $2$ , because the order of $P$ is $n$ , so that $n$ must divide $2^m$ if we want $P^{2^m}=I$ . So $I+P$ is nilpotent if and only if $n$ is a power of $2$ . Now I generalise the problem to the following: Consider the $n\times n$ matrix $I-P$ whose entries are elements in $\Bbb Z/k\Bbb Z$ for some integer $k\ge3$ , where $I$ is the identity matrix, and $P$ is the permutation matrix whose sub-diagonal entries are $1$ , top-right entry is $1$ , and all else are $0$ . Find necessary and sufficient conditions on $n$ such that $I-P$ is nilpotent. When $k$ is a prime, the above method easily generalises to show that necessary and sufficient condition is that $n$ is a power of $k$ . Raise $I-P$ to the power of the prime number $k$ consecutively to see that $$(I-P)^k=I+C_1^k(-P)+C_2^k(-P)^2+\cdots+C_{k-1}^k(-P)^{k-1}+(-P)^k=I-P^k,$$ $$(I-P)^{k^m}=I-P^{k^m},$$ because $C_r^k=0$ in $\Bbb Z/k\Bbb Z$ for each of $r=1,2,\dots,k-1$ due to $k$ being prime (the prime factor $k$ in the numerator $k!$ is not cancelled by any factor in $(k-r)!r!$ ). We want $I-P^{k^m}=0$ for large enough $m$ , and this is possible if and only if $n$ is a power of $k$ . When $k$ is composite, the above trick does not work. I only made a few conjectures on what $n$ and $k$ works. Before that, note the following observation: if for a standard basis vector $e_i$ , $(I-P)^me_i=0$ for large enough $m$ , then $I-P$ is nilpotent. This is due to that $I-P$ is self-similar by $P$ : $P^{-1}(I-P)P=I-P$ , so that $(I-P)^me_i=0$ means $$(I-P)^me_{i+1}=(I-P)^mPe_i=PP^{-1}(I-P)^mPe_i=P(I-P)^me_i=0$$ as well, and $(I-P)^me_{i+2}=0$ , and so on. With this, we can do some faster checking whether $I-P$ is nilpotent. I checked that when $k=4$ , $n=2$ and $n=4$ are solutions (that $I-P$ is nilpotent would be nilpotent), and when $k=9$ , $n=3$ is a solution. I conjecture that when $k$ is a square of a prime, $n$ being a power of the prime is a necessary and sufficient condition for $I-P$ to be nilpotent.

93,Finding Annihilators for Recurrence Relations,Finding Annihilators for Recurrence Relations,,"Recently I've taken an interest in solving recurrence relations using annihilators but I'm still unclear as to how to find such annihilators. My professor provides the following linear recurrence in his lecture notes: $r_i$ = $7r_{i-1}$ - $16r_{i-2}$ + $12r_{i-3}$ with initial conditions $r_0$ = 1, $r_1$ = 5, and $r_2$ = 17 for some reason, the recurrence is converted to: $r_{i+3}$ - $7r_{i+2}$ + $16r_{i+1}$ - $12r_i$ = 0 and the annihilator found from there. Could someone please provide some insight as to how the recurrence was converted to this form? Also there's the matter of actually applying annihilators to recurrence relations themselves. For example, I'm still stumped as to how the annihilator $E^2$ - $E$ - $1$ when applied to the fibonacci recurrence $F_i$ = $F_{i-1} + F_{i-2}$ actually yields a sequence of all o's.

Then, by definition of the inverse relation, $(a,c)\in (S\circ R)$ . By the definition of the composite relation, there exists $b\in B$ such that $(a,b)\in R$ and $(b,c)\in S$ .

Determining whether a graph with $n$ nodes can be coloured with $2$ colors. Determining whether a graph with $n$ nodes can be colored with $3$ colors. My Attempts: 1) I'm not sure if this is correct because the question specifies the number of digits to be $n$ and not that the actual prime number is $n$ . So in the latter case, we only need to check the division of $n$ with primes that are less than $\sqrt{n}$ . This reasoning doesnt feel correct. 2) So if we first choose one node we can choose among $n$ of them, then we can choose to go to $n-1$ other nodes, and then $n-2$ and so on. So we get $n!$ which is not in polynomial time, thus it is NP-complete. 3) This one is trickier, i can't really use a similar argument as for the hamiltoncycle. I don't know the number of edges.
