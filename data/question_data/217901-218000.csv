8,Proving linear independence of the functions $\sin (nx)$ and $\sin (mx)$ without using Wronskian,Proving linear independence of the functions  and  without using Wronskian,\sin (nx) \sin (mx),"I was asked to show the linear independence of the functions $\sin (nx)$ and $\sin (mx)$ where $m,n\in \mathbb N$ , $m\neq n$ . It can of course be done by computing the Wronskian, but I just wanted to avoid it and go old school. Here's a small sketch of my solution- Let $f(x)=a\sin(mx)+b\sin(nx)=0\;\;\forall x$ We have three cases, namely both $m,n$ are even; exactly one of them is even; or both of them are odd. Case I: Both are even Let $m=2^{k_m}\times o_m$ and $n=2^{k_n}\times o_n$ where $o_m$ and $o_n$ are odd. WLOG, assume $k_m>k_n$ . Put $x=\frac \pi{2^{k_m}}$ and note that $$f\left(\frac \pi{2^{k_m}}\right)=a\sin(\mathtt{odd}\times \pi)+b\sin\left(\mathtt{odd}\times \frac \pi{2^l}\right)$$ for some $l\in \mathbb N$ . So, $$f\left(\frac \pi{2^{k_m}}\right)=0+cb$$ for some $c\in [-1,1]\backslash\{0\}$ , which completes the proof of $a=b=0$ . Case II: Exactly one of them is even We will use the same idea as before. Let the highest power of $2$ in the even number be $k$ and use that to arrive at the form $$a\sin(\mathtt{odd}\times \pi)+b\sin\left(\mathtt{odd}\times \frac \pi{2^h}\right)$$ and complete the proof. Case III: Both are odd Evaluate $f$ at $x_1=\frac \pi 2$ and $x_2=\frac {3\pi}2$ to get the equations $$a+b=0\\ a-b=0$$ solving which gives us $a=b=0$ . Is this proof okay? Especially, is the last case okay? If not, how can we tackle that case? Also, is there a smarter choice of the $x$ 's to arrive at the same conclusion? One solution that I got is that just checking the zeroes of the two functions are enough to arrive at the conclusion of dependence.

When that circle is viewed under an inclination $i$ , the phase $\theta$ of any point w.r.t. the origin changes. How does that projected arc length $\Delta\theta$ change when the circle is viewed under an inclination $i$ EDIT2 in terms of the initial phase $theta$ of the unit circle? Long version: I am an astronomer and am making a model of a ring around a star (let's ignore the astrophysics for this question). That ring has a number of $n$ ""parcels of gas"" on it, each with an arc length of $\Delta\theta=\frac{2\pi}{n}$ EDIT2 at a phase $\theta$ . When that ring is viewed under an inclination $i$ ( $0$ deg=face-on, $90$ deg=edge-on), that angle $\theta^{circ}->\theta^{ellip}$ changes of course. How does the observed arc length, call it $\Delta\theta'$ , of the parcels of gas change with that inclination $i$ in terms of the $\textbf{initial phase $\theta$}$ ? Of course this is dependent on the azimuth/phase $\theta$ of each parcel, where any $\theta$ is defined as $0$ at either equinox/along the semi major axis of the ellipse. For the parcels at the peri/apastron, that is for $\theta^{ellip}=\pi\pm\frac{\pi}{2}$ , the change should be negligible, even for a high $i$ . For those at the equinoxes, i.e. for $\theta^{ellip}=\{0,\pi\}$ , the observed arc length should become smaller and smaller for an increasing $i$ . My colleague has derived a rather simple solution which I do not think is totally correct. Hence, I would love to know your take on this matter. EDIT: My colleague's solution was simply: $\Delta\theta' = \rho\cdot\Delta\theta$ , where $\rho$ is the distance from the origin to the position of the gas parcel in the ellipse - however, that is confusing the azimuth on the circle $\theta$ with the eccentric anomaly in the ellipse. Hence, that cannot be the right answer. EDIT2: The problem is that I need the solution in terms of the point's initial phase on the circle.

I was learning about finding the minimum and maximum values of an expression of this form for some given value of $a$ and $b$ by expressing it in terms of a single trigonometric function. My textbook did it by assuming that $a = m\sin\phi$ and $b = m\cos\phi$ , where $m \in \Bbb R$ and $\phi$ is some angle. But I couldn't wrap my head  around the fact that any two real numbers can be expressed as the product of another real number and a trigonometric function for some angle. So, I decided to take another approach which is highly similar to this one. It is solely based on the assumption that the expression can be expressed in the form of $r\cos\theta$ , where $r \in \Bbb R$ and $\theta$ is some angle. Once this assumption is proved, here's how I will continue it : $$a\cos x + b\sin x = r\cos\theta$$ Let's say that $\theta = \alpha + x$ . So : $$a\cos x + b\sin x = r\cos(\alpha + x) = (r\cos\alpha)\cos x + (-r\sin\alpha)\sin x$$ This gives us the values of $a$ and $b$ as $r\cos\alpha$ and $-r\sin\alpha$ respectively. So, it would work perfectly if I can prove the assumption mentioned above. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to prove it yet. I was successful in proving it's converse, though i.e. for a given expression, say $p\cos\gamma$ , where $p \in \Bbb R$ and $\gamma$ is some angle, it can be expressed in the form of $c\cos\delta + d\sin\delta$ where $c \in \Bbb R$ , $d \in \Bbb R$ and $\delta$ is some angle. This is highly similar to what I've stated above (what I'd do once the assumption is proved). First, we assume that $\gamma = \beta + \delta$ , where $\beta$ and $\delta$ are two angles that fit in the equation. $$\therefore p\cos\gamma = p\cos(\beta + \delta) = p(\cos\beta\cos\delta - \sin\beta\sin\delta) = (p\cos\beta)\cos\delta + (-p\sin\beta)\sin\delta$$ Substituting $p\cos\beta$ by $c$ and $-p\sin\beta$ by $d$ , we can arrive at $c\cos\delta + d\sin\delta$ . I don't know if this will be helpful in proving the initial assumption that an expression $a\cos x + b\sin x$ can be expressed as $r\cos\theta$ for some angle $\theta$ and for some real value of $r$ .

70,Good way of explaining how to find all solutions to $\sin\theta+a=0$,Good way of explaining how to find all solutions to,\sin\theta+a=0,"I'm not sure exactly how to properly describe this trigonometry problem, so I will just write it out. It is less of a ""problem"" and more of a ""I can't find a really good way to explain it"". We want to find a value $\theta$ such that $$\sin\theta + a = 0,$$ where $|a| < 1$ . Subtracting $a$ from both sides gives us $\sin\theta = -a$ , and one solution is easily seen to be $\theta = \arcsin(-a)$ . However, because $-1 < -a < 1$ , there should be two possible values of $\theta$ that give $\sin\theta = -a$ . I'll call the one we already found $\theta_1$ , and the one we are looking for $\theta_2$ . The best explanation I could think of is, when looking at the unit circle, $\sin\theta_1$ is considered the $y$ coordinate on the circle, while $\cos\theta_1$ is the corresponding $x$ coordinate. However, if you reflected across the $y$ axis, that other angle will also satisfy $\sin\theta_2 = -a$ . This reflection across the $y$ axis corresponds to $\theta_2 = \pi - \theta_1$ , and this is correct, because $$\sin\theta_2 = \sin(\pi - \theta_1) = \sin\pi + \sin\theta_1 = 0 -a = -a.$$ So we have our two solutions: $$\theta_1 = \arcsin(-a) \\ \theta_2 = \pi - \arcsin(-a).$$ My problem is I feel like my solution is too ""wordy"" and not elegant enough. Maybe it's not possible, but is there a better, more analytic way of deriving this result? Since $|\arctan x| \le \pi/2$ , I feel like it would be impossible to easily derive $\theta_2$ like we did $\theta_1$ , since $|\theta_2| \ge \pi/2$ , so there is no way for $\arctan x$ to ever map to that value.","I'm not sure exactly how to properly describe this trigonometry problem, so I will just write it out.

91,How to locate an unknown point using the TDOA method of Trilateration,How to locate an unknown point using the TDOA method of Trilateration,,"I'm attempting to solve a problem similar to trilateration but with slightly different data. I want to find the center of a circle (in my case, its coordinate is the origin of a sound wave). Let's call the center of this circle $c$ . Imagine then I have a set of three points $p1...p3$ which are equidistant from each other, but all different distances from the origin of the sound, $c$ . Imagine a circle travelling outward from $c$ (this is the sound wave propagating). It will ""hit"" one of these points first - let's call this point $p_1$ . This point then, by definition, intersects with the circle propagating from $c$ at this point in time. Imagine for the sake of this explanation that this circle then stops propagating outwards, and instead, circles begin propagating from each of the remaining points $p_2$ and $p_3$ until these circles lie tangentially on the circle centered on $c$ at the moment that it intersects with $p_1$ . I'm hoping that this can be visually intuited with the graph below (The green point is $c$ , the point in the bottom right is $p_1$ , and the other two points whose circles lie tangentially to the circle centered on $c$ are naturally $p_1...p_2$ ): In actuality though, I only have a subset of the data depicted above known to me. That subset is: The coordinates of $p_1$ , $p_2$ , and $p_3$ . The radii of the circles centered on $p_2$ and $p_3$ . My question: with only these known quantities, is it even possible for me to deduce the center of $c$ ? If so, how? I've tried following trilateration tutorials, done a fair bit of article reading, but this seems like a weird sub-field / nuanced problem that seems to be preventing the information from applying completely. Any help would be much appreciated. Thank you!","I'm attempting to solve a problem similar to trilateration but with slightly different data.
