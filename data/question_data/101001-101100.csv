0,Problems with seemingly not enough information,Problems with seemingly not enough information,,"Two of my favorite geometry problems are as follows: Consider two concentric circles with the property that a chord of the larger circle with length 20 is tangent to the inner circle.  What is the area of the region between the circles? Consider a sphere with a circular hole drilled through its center, such that the height of the remaining ring (in the direction along the hole) is $h$ .  What is the volume of the ring? The fascinating thing about these problems is that they seem to be under-determined: In the first case, it seems that you should need to know at least one of the circles' radii; in the second case it seems that you should need to know the radius of the sphere or the radius of the hole.  It turns out that the answer is independent of these unknown quantities, however, so the questions are well posed. Another cute fact about these problems is that, supposing them to be well posed, they admit very easy computations of their answers, since we can choose the unknown parameters to be whatever we want to facilitate the computation: In the first case, choosing the radius of the inner circle to be zero, the chord is a diameter of the outer circle, and the desired area is just the area of the same circle, $\pi \times 10^2 = 100 \pi$ . In the second case, choosing the radius of the hole to be zero, the volume is just that of a full sphere of radius $h/2$ , i.e. $\frac{1}{6}\pi h^3$ . Question: What are other examples of problems which seem to be ill-posed, but are not? I once thought that these two problems were anomalous, but I've recently discovered there are other examples.  (I will post one if no one else does.)  The examples need not come from geometry.  Please post only one problem per answer, and if (as with the above problems) a computation is simplified by assuming the problem to be well posed, please explain.","Two of my favorite geometry problems are as follows: Consider two concentric circles with the property that a chord of the larger circle with length 20 is tangent to the inner circle.

I conjecture that if I go for a run at a constant pace along any path where I end at the same spot where I started, and if we assume the sun has stood completely still throughout my run, then I'll have gotten exactly as much sun on the front of my body as I did on the back of my body. More precisely, I conjecture that if I take any spot on my body, it will have gotten the same amount of sun as the opposite spot (in reference to a vertical axis going through my center. So - the ""opposite""of the tip of my left shoulder is the tip of my right shoulder at the same height, etc.). Maybe we can just assume I'm a cylinder for simplicity (?). Let's definitely assume the sun is at an ""infinite distance"" (i.e. the rays are parallel over the entire region where I'm running). First of all, is my conjecture true? Second of all, how would we approach trying to prove it if it's true? My intuition tells me something related to the standard integral theorems of vector calculus might be a way to go: Stokes' theorem, etc. For simplicity, we can start by assuming a simple closed path that doesn't cross itself ...

The community reviewed whether to reopen this question last year and left it closed: Original close reason(s) were not resolved So, I realise that the area of a circle is actually $\pi r^2,$ so basically half of $2\pi r^2,$ however, after trying to prove the area of a circle for myself, I came up with a really convincing and intuitive theorem for why it is 2πr^2 (even though it is not). By the way, I've set the radius to 100/2π so that the circumference would be 100, as I wanted to mark the percentage moved across the circumference for any given angle. There is no reason for this with respects to (my attempt of) this so-called 'proof', it is just for convenience. If you take the circumference of a circle and you flatten it out into a straight line, it would look something like this: From here, I reason that a line segment can be drawn across any , indeed every point along the line equal to the radius of the circle, since said line is equal to the circumference of the circle to begin with, and thus this step just falls out of the definition for how a circle is even defined. Here are a few examples: If you did this for every point across the circumfence and its corresdonding line, you would have filled in the area of the circle on the left, and created a rectangle on the right, whose length (x-axis) is the circumference of the circle and whose height (y-axis) is the radius: It's not obvious what the circumference multiplied by the radius would be, but since we know that the diameter goes into the circumference π times, we can just rewrite the circumference as π•diameter, and in turn rewrite the diameter as 2•radius, so 2πr. Having rewrote the circumference as 2πr, we just multiply this by r to derive 2πr^2. As you can see, this attempt of a proof involves only three steps. It is short, simple, intuitive, and, dare I say, eloquent. Above all else, however, it is also wrong. You can even see this visually, just by eyeballing the image. Now, I need no convincing on what the area of a circle actually is. I've looked up actual proofs online showing why it is πr^2, and I also simply trust the likes of Archimedes, as well as Pythagoras, Newton, the team at NASA, etc. What I need convincing of, however, is that my proof is incorrect. By ""convincing"", I don't mean it in the usual sense, but in quite a literal one. As in, I can consciously accept that my attempted proof is incorrect (again you can even see this visually by comparing the areas of the circle/rectangle), but my heart and soul cannot, because I've managed to construct such a simple, easy to follow, and intuitive proof that ended up being false.

I mean sure, the mistake is that my derived equation is off by a factor of exactly 2, but there's something very fundamental about the nature of maths itself that I clearly have not grasped, and I have absolutely no starting point to work from in trying to figure out what that is.

76,Intuition on the direction of steepest ascent always being orthogonal to the level set of the function,Intuition on the direction of steepest ascent always being orthogonal to the level set of the function,,"Thanks for reading. THE QUESTION: Convince me that when on the surface of a smooth hill, the $(x,y)$ direction I should take a tiny step in such that my current height doesn't change is always perpendicular to the $(x,y)$ direction I should take a tiny step in so that my height changes by the most. More Mathematically formulated: Convince me, intuitively, that the direction of steepest ascent is perpendicular to the level-set of a function. Convince me, intuitively, that if I""m standing on a smooth hill, the direction of steepest ascent is perpendicular to the direction I should move in so that the height doesn't change at all. Why I'm asking it: (This section is going to be really long, but just because I want to be helpful to potential responders and explain exactly what I understand and what I don't understand in as much depth as possible. If you read it all, thank you so much!) I've always had trouble understanding that the gradient is the direction of steepest ascent. I've seen some excellent answers on this site, like this one... Why is gradient the direction of steepest ascent? ...and this one... Gradient of a function as the direction of steepest ascent/descent ...and honestly, most answers seem to answer in the same way: by proving that the dot product of a vector of fixed length with the gradient, which by definition is the change in the function at that point, is maximum when the vector of fixed length (the step) points in direction of the gradient. That answer is fine...but I've always had a little bit of trouble understanding it. That's because although the phrase "" ...take the step that points in the direction of the gradient to maximize the dot product between the step's direction and the gradient..."" is mathematically sound, the idea of ""the direction"" of the gradient isn't something I""m really comfortable with, since I view the gradient as an operator on a vector $\begin{bmatrix} dx\\  dy \end{bmatrix}$ that outputs by how much some $f(x,y)$ would change at some specific $(x,y)$ if we took that ""step"". It's hard for me to think of the gradient as a vector itself. So yea, I've never really truly understood the ""direction of steepest ascent"" of a function. However, something I DO understand is the level-sets of a function. These are all the $(x,y)$ points such that some $f(x,y)$ stays constant. For example, if $f(x,y)=x+2y$ , then $(x+2y)=1$ would be a level-set. In the picture above, the red plane is $z=f(x,y)$ , and the green plane is $(x+2y)=1$ . As you can see, the intersection of the two planes is flat, indicating that $f(x,y)$ is constant for all $(x,y)$ such that $(x+2y)=1$ . Now, say I was standing on that intersection, where $z=1$ , and I wanted to know which $(x,y)$ direction to take a step in so that I didn't move up or down the mountain? I would need to move in a $(x,y)$ direction such that $(x+2y)$ stayed constant. Say I take a tiny step in some arbitrary direction. That step will have an $x$ component and a $y$ component. We can represent that tiny step as a vector: $\begin{bmatrix} dx\\  dy \end{bmatrix}$ . For whatever tiny amount $dx$ that step corresponds to in the $x$ direction, $f(x,y)$ (my height) will change by $dx$ , since at that $(x,y,f(x,y))$ point I'm standing on on that smooth mountain, $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}=1$ . On the other hand, for whatever tiny amount $dy$ that step corresponds to in the $y$ direction, $f(x,y)$ (my height) will change by $2dy$ , since at that $(x,y,f(x,y))$ point I'm standing on on that smooth mountain, $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}=2$ . In general, at any $(x,y,f(x,y))$ , the amount by which $f(x,y)$ changes when I take a tiny step $\begin{bmatrix} dx\\  dy \end{bmatrix}$ is the amount by which it changes due to the component of our step in the $x$ direction, which would be $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} * dx$ , plus the amount that it changes in due to the component of our step in the $y$ direction, which would be $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} * dy$ . In this specific example, the function changes twice as much for any step in the $y$ direction than it does for any step in the $x$ direction. That means that if I don't want $f(x,y)$ to change at all, then for whatever amount I move in the $y$ direction, I must move negative twice that amount in the $x$ direction, since any fixed amount of movement in the $y$ direction corresponds to twice the change in height as does any movement in the $x$ direction! In other words, the direction of my step should be: $\begin{bmatrix} -2\\  1 \end{bmatrix}$ . Let's say I was instead standing at an $(x,y,f(x,y))$ point where a tiny step in the $x$ direction corresponded to 42 times the change in altitude than a tiny step in the $y$ direction did. In other words, $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}=42\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$ at that point. Then, to not change height at all (stay on the level-set) , I would want to take a tiny step in the $\begin{bmatrix} 1\\  -42 \end{bmatrix}$ . I'd want to make sure that my step moves me $-42$ times as much in the $y$ direction as we do in the $x$ . More generally, if I'm standing at some point $(x,y,f(x,y))$ on a smooth mountain, the step I should take such that my altitude doesn't change (such that $f(x,y)$ doesn't change) should always be $\begin{bmatrix} +\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\\  -\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \end{bmatrix}$ This makes sense to me - no dot products needed so far!!!! Now, I know that the direction orthogonal to $\begin{bmatrix} +\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\\  -\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \end{bmatrix}$ corresponds to taking the negative reciprocal of it. That is: $\begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\\  \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \end{bmatrix}$ AND THAT'S THE DIRECTION OF STEEPEST ASCENT! In summary, I understand why the ""direction of no ascent"" is what it is. If I could somehow intuitively understand that the ""direction of steepest ascent"" when climbing a mountain is always perpendicular to the direction of no ascent, then I would understand why the gradient is in the direction of steepest ascent. Thanks! One more thing... I tagged this question as a soft question simply because I'm looking for intuitive answers more than mathematical proofs, and it's hard to say whether or not intuitive answers are correct. Copied and pasted from a comment below... I'd like to be able to picture myself standing on the surface of a smooth hill, standing over a spot where someone took a bright neon marker and traced out a level-curve on that hill, and picture the hill in such a way that the direction in which the hill is steepest is OBVIOUSLY perpendicular to that hill.

80,Three-dimensional art galleries,Three-dimensional art galleries,,"The well-known art gallery problem starts with an ""art gallery"" (a simple polygon in the plane, not necessarily convex) and asks for the minimum number of ""guards"" (points on the polygon) required to ""observe the whole gallery"" (to have the property that for any point in the interior of the polygon, there is a line segment from that point to a ""guard"" that lies entirely within the polygon).  Chvatal showed that if the polygon has $n$ vertices, then $\lfloor n/3\rfloor$ guards are sufficient, and sometimes necessary, to observe the whole gallery. If you forget about trying to minimize the number of guards, and simply want to place guards so that they see the whole gallery, it is reasonably clear that if you place a guard at each vertex of a simple polygon, they will be able to observe the whole gallery. One way to see this is to note that the assertion is clear for triangles, and then to recall (or to convince oneself) that any simple polygon can be triangulated without adding vertices. If visualizing an entire triangulation of the polygon is too ""global"", one can think ""locally"" as follows.  Fix any point $p$ in the gallery interior.  Choose a point $q$ on the polygon such that the distance from $p$ to $q$ is minimized.  The line segment from $p$ to $q$ lies within the gallery.  If $q$ is a vertex, we are done.  Otherwise, $q$ is on the interior of an edge.  Pick a direction on that edge and move $q$ along the edge in that direction.  Eventually, one of two things will happen: (1) the point $q$ becomes a vertex, or (2) there is a first time at which the line segment from $p$ to $q$ intersects the polygon somewhere besides $q$.  In case (1) we are done, and in case (2), we can convince ourselves that at the time that this happens, the closest point to $p$ on the intersection of the polygon and the line segment must be a vertex, and we are again done. Now switch from two dimensions to three so an ""art gallery"" is now a polyhedron.  If you place a guard at each vertex, can they observe the whole gallery? The answer, in general, is no. It may not be clear why it is no, but it is relatively clear that the arguments just given do not generalize in any simple way. There are polyhedra that cannot be ""triangulated"" into tetrahedra without adding vertices.  A famous example of this is the Schoenhardt polyhedron .  (Yet: experimenting with this applet convinced me that the vertices of this polyhedron do see all of its interior.) The ""given $p$, pick a closest point $q$ on the polyhedron, and then move $q$ in some direction"" idea clearly cannot work (at least without judicious choice of direction), because in the case (2) there is no reason for the closest point on the intersection of the line segment from $p$ to $q$ with the polyhedron to be a vertex in the three-dimensional case.

83,Six touching circles inside a seventh imply $a+b+c=r$,Six touching circles inside a seventh imply,a+b+c=r,"This is from another question which I started answering but which has been closed before I could finish my answer. Right now there is still a gap in my answer, so it is now my turn to ask about this problem in an attempt to fill that gap. We have a ring of six circles with radii $a,b,c,a,b,c$ , each of them touching both the previus and the next one from the outside. They also all touch the inside of a circle of radius $r$ . Show that $a+b+c=r$ . The original question described this as a sangaku, so I'll keep that tag. But I don't know a source where this came from. (Update: See comment from brainjam for a source .) Below I'll show my approach for how to prove this fact, but there is one gap that I don't have a good handle for. Also, my approach used a lot of computer algebra, so there is a high chance someone has a more intuitive approach which would be better suited to a paper and pencil computation, or perhaps even avoid computations altogether. The whole configuration has to be point symmetric with respect to the center of the circumcircle. Let's use $O$ to denote that center, $A,B,C$ for the centers of the first three circles, and $A',B',C'$ for those of their point reflections in $O$ . Define $\alpha:=\measuredangle AOB, \beta:=\measuredangle BOC, \gamma:=\measuredangle COA'$ . Due to the point symmetry, $\alpha+\beta+\gamma=\pi$ . As we want to use the cosine rule eventually, let's first use angle sum formulas to rewrite this in terms of trigonometric functions. \begin{align*} \alpha+\beta+\gamma&=\pi \\ \cos(\alpha+\beta+\gamma) &= -1 \\ \cos(\alpha+\beta)\cos\gamma-\sin(\alpha+\beta)\sin\gamma &= -1 \\ \cos\alpha\cos\beta\cos\gamma-\sin\alpha\sin\beta\cos\gamma -\sin\alpha\cos\beta\sin\gamma-\cos\alpha\sin\beta\sin\gamma &= -1 \end{align*} Now the sines are in the way here. So let me combine $\sin^2\alpha+\cos^2\alpha=1$ with the equation above to eliminate $\sin\alpha$ , then do the same with $\beta$ and $\gamma$ . I used Sage and resultants for this elimination. The result I got was some polynomial of total degree $12$ in the cosines of the angles, but factoring it returned just a single factor with exponent $4$ which represents the following equivalent equation: $$2\cos\alpha\cos\beta\cos\gamma + \cos^2\alpha+\cos^2\beta + \cos^2\gamma = 1$$ Now we can apply the cosine rule to find a relation between these cosines of the angles and the radii of the circles. That is because of the triangles seen in the figure above, the edges of which are sums or differences of radii. \begin{align*} (a+b)^2 &= (r-a)^2 + (r-b)^2 - 2(r-a)(r-b)\cos\alpha \\ (b+c)^2 &= (r-b)^2 + (r-c)^2 - 2(r-b)(r-c)\cos\beta \\ (c+a)^2 &= (r-c)^2 + (r-a)^2 - 2(r-c)(r-a)\cos\gamma \end{align*} I can use the first of these to eliminate $\cos\alpha$ , the second to eliminate $\cos\beta$ and the third to eliminate $\cos\gamma$ , again using resultants. When I factor the resulting degree $12$ polynomial I get: $$ (a + b + c - r)\cdot r^2\cdot (a - r)^2 \cdot (b - r)^2 \cdot (c - r)^2 \cdot (4abc - ar^2 - br^2 - cr^2 + r^3) = 0 $$ The first of these factors is the condition $a+b+c=r$ we are trying to prove. So we need to show that all the other factors are non-zero to conclude that the first one has to be zero. This will hopefully boil down to some reasonable non-degeneracy assumptions. $r\neq 0$ is reasonable to assume since otherwise we don't have a proper circumcircle anyway. $r\neq a, r\neq b, r\neq c$ follow from the assumption that the inner circles are actually smaller, so their radius can't be equal to that of the circumcircle. But how do we know $4abc - ar^2 - br^2 - cr^2 + r^3\neq 0$ ? Why can we rule that out? Does that term have any intuitive geometric interpretation? Also, do you have any alternative approaches to suggest for this whole problem? Update: Rewriting that last factor as $4abc - (a+b+c-r)r^2$ (as some of the proposed answers did) we can see that if the assumption holds, that parenthesis becomes zero and the whole term becomes positive. So we might want to prove that $4abc > (a+b+c-r)r^2$ holds without building that proof on the assumption $a+b+c=r$ . Perhaps some clever chain of well-argued inequalities can achieve that. I'm convinced that $\frac r6\le a,b,c\le\frac r2$ but my reasoning for the lower bound currently involves the assumption we try to prove, and anyway doesn't lead to the desired inequality in an obvious way. Update 2: After reading the answers it becomes clear that $a+b+c=r$ can be concluded if we assume that the six inner circles don't overlap, don't have any inner points common to two of them. That condition obviously holds in the example figure, but hasn't been explicitly stated in my original wording of the problem statement.","This is from another question which I started answering but which has been closed before I could finish my answer.

94,Is Euclidean Geometry complete and unique,Is Euclidean Geometry complete and unique,,"Please help me understand this concept of completeness of geometry and set me on the right path. This is my context: From wikipedia, a formal system is complete if every tautology is also a theorem. For me this means that a system of axioms is complete if every statement that is true can be proved from the axioms (the question is tautologies in what kind of logic, first order, second order,...?). Anyway, it seems then that the concept of completeness depend on the system of axioms. So, in the case of Euclidean Geometry, its completeness depends on their axioms (For example Euclid's Axioms, Hilbert Axioms, Tarki's Axioms,etc). Comparing for example the axioms of Hilbert and the axioms given by Tarski, I can see that they are essentially different in that Hilbert uses second order logic and Tarski's only first order logic. Also Tarski proved that his system of axioms is complete. Now, the incompleteness theorem of Gödel stated that the system of axioms of arithmetic is incomplete. So, when we consider $R^2$ and $R^3$ as a representation of Euclidean Geometry we are talking about a system that is not complete because we are using the real numbers. So, are we speaking of different Euclidean Geometries? I'm totally confused.","Please help me understand this concept of completeness of geometry and set me on the right path.

Consider the semicircle made of the upper half of the unit circle and the horizontal diameter with endpoints $A(-1,0)$ and $B(1,0)$ . Let us now consider the family $(F)$ of circles inscribed into this semicircle as can be seen on Fig. 1. Fig. 1: Certain circles of family $(F).$ They can be described in a parametric way as circles $$\text{with center} \ (x_c=-\cos a, y_c=\frac12 \sin^2a) \ \text{and radius} \ y_c, \ a \in (0,\pi) \tag{1}$$ or equivalently as circles $(C_T)$ $$\text{with center} \ \left(x_c=\frac{T^2-1}{(1+T)^2}, y_c=\frac{2T}{(1+T)^2}\right) \ \text{and radius} \ y_c, \ T \in (0,+\infty) \tag{2}$$ (Connection between the two parameterizations: $T=t^2$ where $t:=\tan \tfrac{a}{2}$ ). The locus of these centers is parabola $(P)$ with cartesian equation: $$y=\tfrac12(1-x^2),\tag{3}$$ represented on Fig. 2 as the light blue curve. Each circle $(C_T) \in F$ is associated with a unique circle $(C_{T'}) \in F$ which is tangent to $(C)$ as depicted on Fig. 2. Fig. 2: Two circles of family $(F)$ are mutually tangent if their parameters $T$ and $T'$ comply with relationship (4). Let $I$ be the point of tangency of $(C_T)$ and $(C_{T'})$ . Question: how can we describe the locus of $I$ ? (sketched as the magenta curve on Fig. 2.) My work: I have obtained through tedious calculations an unexpected linear relationship between parameters $T$ and $T'$ which is: $$T=(3-2 \sqrt{2})T'\tag{4}$$ Using (4), I have tried to obtain the locus of $I$ as the envelope of chords defined by the line segment joining the centers of circles $C_T,C_{T'}$ using homographies but to no avail.

Its circle of inversion is  the black circle (center $S$ , radius $\sqrt{2}$ ). It is easy to see that any circle of family (F) is globally invariant.
