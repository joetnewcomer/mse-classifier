0,Are there infinitely many Mama's numbers and no Papa's numbers?,Are there infinitely many Mama's numbers and no Papa's numbers?,,"Just playing with square numbers, I made an interesting observation. $$11\times 11=121$$ $$12\times 12=144$$ $$13\times 13=169$$ $$.$$ $$.$$ $$.$$ $$20\times 20=400$$ $$21\times 21=441$$ $$.$$ $$.$$ $$.$$ . So, we will go from left to right and take two number to form a new number from the square numbers I listed above. For example from the number $169$ we can make three numbers $16,19,69$ but numbers $61,91,96$ are not allowed. Similarly for four digit numbers like $2401$ we are allowed to take $6$ numbers which are $24,20,21,40,41,01$ but we are not allowed to count $42,02,12,04,14,10$ . Now, look at the number $289$ . It is square of $17$ . We see that we can select three two digit numbers $28,89,29$ . Notice that $28$ is composite while $89$ and $29$ are primes. Next notice the number $256$ . It is square of $16$ . We can select three two digit numbers $25,26,56$ all of which happen to be composite. So, now we are in the position to have definitions: A Mama's number is a number $x>10$ such that all the two digit combinations of numbers chosen from $x^2$ from left to right are composite. Some trivial examples of Mama's numbers are $24$ as $24^2=576$ and $28$ as $28^2=784$ . Next: A Papa's number is a number $y>10$ such that all the two digit combinations of numbers chosen from $y^2$ from left to right are primes. The numbers which contain a prime as well as a composite in two digit combinations from left to right are neither Mama's nor Papa's numbers. I checked from $1$ to $50$ by hand and sadly I found no Papa's numbers. While several Mama's numbers were $15,16,18,20,22,24,25,28,30,38,40$ . Now, I have two questions: Are there infinitely many Mama's numbers? Is there any Papa's number? I hope I made myself clear.

18,Zolotarev's Lemma and Quadratic Reciprocity,Zolotarev's Lemma and Quadratic Reciprocity,,"The law of quadratic reciprocity is unquestionably one of the most famous results of mathematics. Carl Gauss, often called the ""Prince of Mathematicians"", referred to it as ""The Golden Theorem"". He published six proofs of it in his lifetime. To date over 200 proofs of this result have been found. The single most frustrating thing about this theorem is that there are no easy proofs of it, at least when measured relative to the simplicity of the statement and the mathematics it involves. For someone like myself, who prides themselves on being able to find very slick proofs, it can drive you insane.

Carl Gauss, often called the ""Prince of Mathematicians"", referred to it as ""The Golden Theorem"". He published six proofs of it in his lifetime. To date over 200 proofs of this result have been found. The single most frustrating thing about this theorem is that there are no easy proofs of it, at least when measured relative to the simplicity of the statement and the mathematics it involves.

36,The Infinitely Nested Radicals Problem and Ramanujan's wondrous formula,The Infinitely Nested Radicals Problem and Ramanujan's wondrous formula,,"In mathematics, a nested-radical is any expression where a radical (or root sign) is nested inside another radical, e.g. $\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{3}}$ . By extension, an infinitely nested radical (aka, a continued root) is an expression where infinitely many radical expressions are nested within each other. A famous example would be: $\sqrt{x\sqrt{x\sqrt{x \dots}}} = \sqrt{x x} = x, \forall x \in \mathbb{R}$ . Another common (and easy to solve) variety occurs when the pattern of numbers within the radicals follows a regular repeating pattern. A simple example of this type is $y = \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + \dots}}} = \sqrt{2 + y} = 2$ . The key is simply to notice that the expression after one repeated cycle is the same as the original and solve the resulting polynomial equation. (A couple of examples here . However, while the above examples were simple, nested roots can actually be quite important and satisfying beyond the surface level. a) The Golden Ratio : The Golden Ratio, $\phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$ is well-known for its regularity and recurring appearance is diverse areas of nature, art and mathematics. The famous continued fraction expression $\phi = 1 + \cfrac{1}{1+ \cfrac{1}{1 + \cdots}}$ is however, also equivalent to the folowing continued square root $\phi = \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1+ \sqrt{1 + \dots}}}$ b) Viète's formula : An approximation for $\pi$ that has been called the starting point of mathematical analysis and even ""the dawn of modern mathematics"", the formula is: $$\frac{2}{\pi} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}}}{2} \cdot \dots$$ which already contains nested radicals. Interestingly, this can also be expressed as: $$\pi = \lim_{k\to\infty} 2^k\cdot\sqrt{2-\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2+... (\text{k - 1 times})}}}$$ which not only contains an infinitely nested radical, but it also contains the same elementary example $\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2 + \dots}}$ from above in slightly modified form! (c) All real numbers in the range $[0,2]$ can be expressed as the infinitely nested radical $\sqrt{2 \pm \sqrt{2 \pm \sqrt{2 \pm \dots}}}$ Examples: $2=\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + \dots}}}=(+)$ , $1=\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2 - \dots}}}=(-)$ , $\phi=\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 - \dots}}}}=(+-)$ (The Golden Ratio again!) (d) Infinitely nested equations are related to polynomial equations and can be sued to find their roots There can be many more examples of such problems. However, the difficult problem here is to solve non-repeating continued-roots such as $\sqrt{1 + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{3 + \dots}}}$ . From a cursory look, one might even expect that expression might be divergent! However, it is actually the Nested Radical constant $1.757932 \dots$ (OEIS A072449), for which no closed-form expression is known. Thus, one can have an arbitrary continued-root, say $\sqrt{a_1 + b_1 \sqrt{a_2 + b_2 \sqrt{a_3 + b_3 \sqrt{a_4 + \dots}}}}$ , where the constants might be determined by some complicated set of rules of formulae. And even for the simplest non-repeating cases, one's ability to solve will be entirely dependent on the ability for algebraic manipulation and knowledge of diverse theorems which might sometimes help. Or so I believed ... Enter Srinivasa Ramanujan... In 1911, around 2 years before he first contacted Hardy, Ramanujan published the following problem in the Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society : $$\sqrt{1 + 2 \sqrt{1 + 3 \sqrt{1 + \dots}}}$$ After waiting 6 months without any solutions, he supplied the following formula from page 105 of his first notebook: $$x + n + a = \sqrt{ax + (n+a)^2 + x \sqrt{a(x+n) + (n+a)^2 + (x+n) \sqrt{\dots}}}$$ And setting $x=2$ , $n=1$ and $a=0$ , we get the solution $$\sqrt{1^2 + (2) \sqrt{1^2+ (2+1)\sqrt{1^2 + \dots}}} = 2+1+0 = 3$$ . (Pg 86-87, The Man Who Knew Infinity: A Life of the Genius Ramanujan , Robert Kanigel, 5th ed. 1991) Right off the bat, we can notice some interesting things here: While we cannot use this formula for the Nested Radical Constant above, it does allow us to find the values of infinitely many continued-roots. In particular we can immediately solve any fraction where the terms are in an Arithmetic Progression $\sqrt{a + b \sqrt{(a+d) + (a+d) \sqrt{(a+2d) + (a+2d) \sqrt{\dots}}}} = a+d + 1$ . We can generalize this further: $\sqrt{c.a + b \sqrt{(a+d) + c.(a+d) \sqrt{c.(a+2d) + (a+2d) \sqrt{\dots}}}} = a+d + c$ . For any given natural number $n$ , we can use this formula to find a number of unique nested fraction expressions equal to $q(n)$ , the number of partitions of that number . And so on... My question: How can we prove this formula? While Ramanujan himself usually derived results with great insight via intuition, I expect that the formula itself should be provable with usual mathematical techniques, especially with the amount of influence Ramanujan had on subsequent mathematics, and the high volume of work on continued fractions which are related to nested-radicals. So, can anyone find any proof for this - either on their own or in existing literature? If we cannot prove this, is it possible to find some motivation that makes it more intuitively clear . This should be possible since that was the way it was originally obtained. Any other interesting observations about this formula? Is it related to any other mathematical results?

58,The Goldbach Conjecture and Hardy-Littlewood Asymptotic,The Goldbach Conjecture and Hardy-Littlewood Asymptotic,,"A source I am reading refers to the Goldbach conjecture (that every even number is the sum of two primes), and then immediately follows with the ""Hardy-Littlewood conjecture"" that $\sum \limits_{n \leq N} \Lambda(n) \Lambda(N-n) = 2 \prod \limits_{p \geq 3} \left(1-\frac{1}{(p-1)^2}\right) \left( \prod \limits_{p | N} \frac{p-1}{p-2}\right)N^{1+o(1)}$ which is termed ""Goldbach for almost all even numbers"", and apparently this also $\Longleftrightarrow \prod \limits_{p | N} (\frac{p-1}{p-2}) N^{1+o(1)} = O(\log N)^c$. Here, $\Lambda(n)$ denotes the Von-Mangoldt function. It then states the following theorem: Let $A \in \mathbb{R}$. Then for all but $\frac{x}{\log^A x}$ even numbers $N \leq x$, we have $\sum \limits_{n \leq N} \Lambda(n) \Lambda(N-n) = 2 \prod \limits_{p \geq 3} \left(1-\frac{1}{(p-1)^2}\right) \left( \prod \limits_{p | N} \frac{p-1}{p-2}\right)N (1+o_A(1))$, where $o_A$ denotes the fact that the constant in the limiting behaviour may depend on $A$. Now I can't see how this is the same as Goldbach at all really. I can see that if $N= p+q$ is the sum of 2 primes then the corresponding term on the LHS will be nonzero, but the Von-Mangoldt function is also nonzero for powers of primes, so it might be nonzero for some $N= P^i + Q^j$. I am beginning to think the RHS may be some sort of probabilistic slant on the conjecture, but can't quite see it. It may be the case that the Von-Mangoldt function is just negligible on all prime powers except the primes themselves (this is certainly often the case), but at the least it seems like this should have been stated somewhere since it certainly doesn't seem like a trivial deduction to me. Or is this simply an ""approximation to Goldbach""; namely a relationship which seems to imply that Goldbach might well be true, but as I have said doesn't remove the problem of the prime powers? (Obviously I am aware that Goldbach is unproved, but the text doesn't clarify whether this is a proved statement weaker than Goldbach, or an unproved statement equivalent to Goldbach: I suspect the latter.) I also can't see how the ""$\Longleftrightarrow$"" follows from the first conjecture; I'd be very grateful if someone could help me understand what's going on here, at least heuristically if not formally. Next, the text goes on to ""prove"" Vinogradov from the latter theorem which has been stated (I say ""prove"" because I can't see how the proof works). It says: Corollary (Vinogradov) Every sufficiently large odd number is the sum of 3 primes.   Proof: Let N be odd. Then taking $A=2$ in the theorem, there is some prime $p\leq N/2$ for which the Hardy-Littlewood asymptotic holds. In particular, $N-p$ is the sum of 2 primes. Now this time I really can't see what's happening: the sum over the Von-Mangoldt function on the LHS will surely just go to zero almost every time $N-n$ is a sum of 2 primes (unless this sum of 2 primes is a prime power of course), and I don't see how the RHS tells us nothing about the LHS except that it is not ""extremely small"". Could anyone explain what's going on here to me? It is possible I transcribed some of this material wrong, though I do not see where I might have made an error which could have caused all my confusions simultaneously. Again, any insight you could provide would be desperately appreciated; many thanks in advance.","A source I am reading refers to the Goldbach conjecture (that every even number is the sum of two primes), and then immediately follows with the ""Hardy-Littlewood conjecture"" that $\sum \limits_{n \leq N} \Lambda(n) \Lambda(N-n) = 2 \prod \limits_{p \geq 3} \left(1-\frac{1}{(p-1)^2}\right) \left( \prod \limits_{p | N} \frac{p-1}{p-2}\right)N^{1+o(1)}$ which is termed ""Goldbach for almost all even numbers"", and apparently this also $\Longleftrightarrow \prod \limits_{p | N} (\frac{p-1}{p-2}) N^{1+o(1)} = O(\log N)^c$.

Or is this simply an ""approximation to Goldbach""; namely a relationship which seems to imply that Goldbach might well be true, but as I have said doesn't remove the problem of the prime powers? (Obviously I am aware that Goldbach is unproved, but the text doesn't clarify whether this is a proved statement weaker than Goldbach, or an unproved statement equivalent to Goldbach: I suspect the latter.) I also can't see how the ""$\Longleftrightarrow$"" follows from the first conjecture; I'd be very grateful if someone could help me understand what's going on here, at least heuristically if not formally. Next, the text goes on to ""prove"" Vinogradov from the latter theorem which has been stated (I say ""prove"" because I can't see how the proof works). It says: Corollary (Vinogradov) Every sufficiently large odd number is the sum of 3 primes.   Proof: Let N be odd. Then taking $A=2$ in the theorem, there is some prime $p\leq N/2$ for which the Hardy-Littlewood asymptotic holds. In particular, $N-p$ is the sum of 2 primes. Now this time I really can't see what's happening: the sum over the Von-Mangoldt function on the LHS will surely just go to zero almost every time $N-n$ is a sum of 2 primes (unless this sum of 2 primes is a prime power of course), and I don't see how the RHS tells us nothing about the LHS except that it is not ""extremely small"". Could anyone explain what's going on here to me? It is possible I transcribed some of this material wrong, though I do not see where I might have made an error which could have caused all my confusions simultaneously. Again, any insight you could provide would be desperately appreciated; many thanks in advance.",,"['number-theory', 'prime-numbers', 'conjectures']"
59,Why this algorithm for egyptian fractions doesn't terminate in ~$2$% cases?,Why this algorithm for egyptian fractions doesn't terminate in ~% cases?,2,"I thought up yet another algorithm for egyptian fraction expansion which turned out to be very effective (in terms of the length and the denominator size) - in most cases. However, for some fractions it doesn't terminate at all - it leads to an infinite loop. Here is the algorithm: Let $\frac{p}{q}<1$ and $p,q$ coprime. Find the minimal $m$ such that $q/(p+m)$ is an integer. We only need to consider $m \in [1,q-p]$. Represent the fraction as: $$\frac{p}{q}=\frac{p+m}{q}-\frac{m}{q}$$ Now to obtain a positive term instead of a negative one, we split the first fraction in two: $$\frac{p+m}{q}-\frac{m}{q}=\frac{p+m}{2q}+\frac{p+m}{2q}-\frac{m}{q}=\frac{p+m}{2q}+\frac{p-m}{2q}$$ Here is a conditional: if $p<m$, then repeat the previous step (add $\frac{p+m}{4q}$ to the negative fraction). And so on, until both terms are positive. If $p>m$ then $\frac{p}{q} \to \frac{p-m}{2q}$ and we repeat the first step of the algorithm. The working name is complementary method, so I will use CM to denote it for now. Despite its simplicity (it's not at all obvious why we are dividing by $2$ instead of using some other way to expand the first term) the algorithm works very well. In a lot of cases it beats every other algorithm I tried. Since the greedy algorithm and Engel expansion are usually bad in terms of denominator size, I used two other methods to compare: Binary Remainder Method and my own 'Splitting-Joining method' (the details can be found in my Mathematica SE question . I also compared it to a modification of Engel proposed by Daniel Fischer in this answer and CM is mostly better for the examples he provided. Some examples of the best results (a sequence of denominators is provided in each case): 4/49: CM {14,98}; BR {16,98,196,392,784}; SJ {13,325,925,1813} 3/35: CM {14,70}; BR {16,70,140,560}; SJ {20,28} 47/104: CM {4,8,13}; BR {4,8,16,104,208}; SJ {4, 14, 26, 28, 52, 70, 104, 130, 182} Some examples of the worst results (but still valid - algorithm terminates): 94/191: CM {4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 24448, 48896, 97792, 195584, 391168, 782336, 1564672} 65/157: CM {4, 8, 32, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 10048, 20096, 40192, 80384, 160768, 643072} 52/139: CM {4, 16, 32, 64, 128, 278, 556, 1112, 2224, 8896, 17792} However, in these cases both BR and SJ methods also give long expansions with large denominators. Now the real problem which I'm trying to solve - why in some cases the algorithm doesn't terminate, but leads to loops ? From large scale experiments I estimates the proportion of such fractions to be about $1.8$% (for numerators and denominators below $1000$). The examples of such 'bad' fractions are: $$\frac{41}{111},\frac{5}{87},\frac{8}{87},\frac{14}{87},\frac{47}{87},\frac{61}{102},\frac{17}{69},\frac{33}{119},\frac{38}{93},\frac{77}{177},\frac{32}{57},\frac{99}{185},\frac{98}{141},\frac{100}{129},\dots$$ The most common denominator is $87$ for some reason. Note that not all of the denominators and/or numerators are prime. The problem can be solved by using $\frac{p-1}{q}$ instead, but not in every case, for example $7/87$ doesn't work either. However, both $6/87$ and $2/87$ work, and give different denominators, so we can expand $8/87$ after all. I think the problem might be related to the use of the expansion $1=1/2+1/2$ to divide the fist term. However, when I tried some other schemes, I didn't get good results (for example, I've got repeating fractions when using $1=1/3+2/3$). The working Mathematica code for the algorithm is: x=6/87; p0=Numerator[x]; q0=Denominator[x]; S=0; Nm=100; a=Table[1,{k,1,Nm}]; m=Table[1,{k,1,Nm}]; p1=p0; q1=q0; j=1; While[Abs[p0]>1&&j<=Nm&&q0<10^35,M=Catch[Do[If[FractionalPart[q0/(p0+k)]<1/10^55,Throw[k]],{k,0,q0-p0}]]; m[[j]]=M; a[[j]]=(p0+M)/(2 q0); p1=Numerator[a[[j]]-M/q0]; q1=Denominator[a[[j]]-M/q0]; While[p1<0,a[[j]]=a[[j]]/2; p1=Numerator[a[[j]]+p1/q1]; q1=Denominator[a[[j]]+p1/q1]]; If[a[[j]]!=1,S+=a[[j]]]; j++; p0=p1;q0=q1]; a[[j]]=p1/q1; S+=a[[j]]; Denominator[Table[a[[k]],{k,1,j}]] And the second question: how to modify the algorithm so it always terminates? Update: Among the first $10000$ fractions with $p \neq 1$ in lexicographic order there are $269$ fractions for which this algorithm doesn't work. (Seems to be more than $2$%). They are: 5/33,5/51,2/55,32/55,4/57,7/57,13/57,23/57,32/57,6/65,43/66,4/69,8/69,11/69,17/69,40/69,50/69,8/85,59/85,4/87,5/87,7/87,8/87,14/87,34/87,47/87,62/87,65/87,76/87,5/93,7/93,10/93,19/93,38/93,50/93,67/93,6/95,8/95,63/95,61/102,9/110,59/110,4/111,7/111,8/111,13/111,16/111,22/111,25/111,31/111,41/111,44/111,59/111,62/111,68/111,82/111,7/114,65/114,71/114,83/114,103/114,6/115,11/115,17/115,63/115,3/119,5/119,10/119,15/119,16/119,33/119,37/119,45/119,61/119,66/119,67/119,71/119,73/119,78/119,96/119,101/119,4/123,5/123,8/123,10/123,11/123,17/123,20/123,26/123,29/123,35/123,46/123,49/123,67/123,70/123,76/123,86/123,92/123,4/129,5/129,10/129,13/129,14/129,19/129,28/129,31/129,37/129,47/129,53/129,71/129,74/129,80/129,91/129,100/129,77/130,53/132,119/132,11/138,31/138,77/138,85/138,91/138,103/138,4/141,5/141,7/141,8/141,14/141,16/141,17/141,23/141,32/141,35/141,41/141,52/141,55/141,74/141,79/141,82/141,88/141,98/141,101/141,110/141,121/141,3/143,7/143,21/143,40/143,42/143,60/143,73/143,80/143,98/143,120/143,138/143,6/145,8/145,13/145,21/145,64/145,79/145,93/145,122/145,6/155,7/155,9/155,12/155,14/155,69/155,99/155,102/155,107/155,131/155,5/159,7/159,10/159,11/159,14/159,19/159,20/159,23/159,32/159,38/159,58/159,64/159,83/159,85/159,91/159,113/159,116/159,125/159,136/159,9/161,11/161,101/161,103/161,16/165,41/165,61/165,116/165,151/165,33/170,101/170,7/174,37/174,43/174,65/174,95/174,97/174,101/174,103/174,115/174,155/174,8/175,11/175,78/175,108/175,111/175,113/175,116/175,148/175,4/177,5/177,8/177,10/177,11/177,13/177,17/177,19/177,20/177,22/177,26/177,29/177,35/177,38/177,44/177,64/177,67/177,70/177,77/177,94/177,95/177,97/177,103/177,122/177,128/177,131/177,137/177,140/177,154/177,4/183,5/183,7/183,10/183,11/183,13/183,14/183,19/183,20/183,22/183,28/183,34/183,37/183,40/183,49/183,65/183,68/183,71/183,74/183 Update 2 (Important) The question was deleted for a time, because for some of the listed fraction algorithm seems to work just fine if it's done by hand.

If $f'/f\in\mathbb{Z}[[x]]$ , must $f/a_0\in\mathbb{Z}[[x]]$ ? (If I haven't made a mistake below, the answer is yes.) The special case of integer polynomials, $f(x) = C\prod_{i=1}^{n}(1-r_i x)^{\alpha_i}\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ , translates (more or less) to the following classical problem: If $\sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i r_i^k \in\mathbb{Z}$ for all $k\ge0$ , then $\prod_{i=1}^{n}(1-r_ix)^{\alpha_i}\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ , or equivalently (by considering minimal polynomials of the $r_i$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ , with coefficients suitably reversed), $\prod_{i=1}^{n}(1-r_ix)\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ . There are a few ways to do the polynomial version, which I'll outline below. However, the only solution I can find right now to the original goes as follows: Yes. WLOG scale so that $\gcd(a_0,a_1,\ldots) = 1$ . For $k\ge1$ , define $g_k = f^{(k)}f^{-1}$ . Note that if we have $g_k\in\mathbb{Z}[[x]]$ for some $k\ge1$ , then differentiating gives $f^{(k+1)}f^{-1} - f^{(k)}f'f^{-2}\in\mathbb{Z}[[x]]$ . But $f^{(k)}f^{-1},f'f^{-1}\in\mathbb{Z}[[x]]$ , so adding their product, $f^{(k)}f'f^{-2}\in\mathbb{Z}[[x]]$ , yields $g_{k+1} = f^{(k+1)}f^{-1}\in\mathbb{Z}[[x]]$ . (A perhaps more natural, but equivalent, way to do the induction: If $f^{(k)} = f g_k$ , then $$f^{(k+1)} = f'g_k + f g'_k = f[g_1g_k + g'_k],$$ and of course $g_1g_k + g'_k\in\mathbb{Z}[[x]]$ .) Thus by induction, $g_k\in\mathbb{Z}[[x]]$ for all $k\ge1$ . But $$g_kf = f^{(k)} = k!\sum_{i\ge0}\binom{i+k}{k}a_{i+k}x^i,$$ so by Gauss's lemma (for formal power series) and the fact that $\gcd(a_0,a_1,\ldots) = 1$ , we in fact have $g_k/k!\in\mathbb{Z}[[x]]$ . In particular, evaluating at $0$ (looking at constant terms) gives $a_0 \mid \binom{0+k}{k}a_{0+k} = a_k$ for all $k\ge1$ , so $f/a_0$ indeed has integer coefficients, as desired. Unfortunately, I don't really grok this proof, even in the simple case of integer polynomials $F = C\prod_{i=1}^{n}(1-r_i x)^{\alpha_i}\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ described above. (I'll use capital $F$ for clarity.) For the polynomial case, I've seen two more intuitive methods that I feel might/should generalize, but unfortunately I can't see exactly how right now: I think the standard proofs more or less use valuations in some way. Note that the conditions hold with $r_i$ replaced by $r_i^s$ , for any fixed $s\ge1$ . By Newton's identities, it's not hard to see that $k$ th symmetric sum $\sigma_k(r_i^s)$ , with multiplicity $\alpha_i$ for $r_i$ , is divisible by $1/k!$ (i.e. $k!\sigma_k\in\mathbb{Z}$ ), so $(\sum\alpha_i)!\prod_{i=1}^{n}(1-r_i^s x)^{\alpha_i}\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ . Thus $(\sum\alpha_i)!r_i^s$ is an algebraic integer for every $s\ge1$ ( $i$ fixed), and we can finish using valuations (as in the second post, or more elementarily but in the same spirit, as in the first post) here . Admittedly, it seems hard to directly extend Newton's identities to ""infinitely many roots"" for formal power series, but I imagine there could be something more indirect. I suppose I'm really wondering if we can define some fruitful kind of ""valuation"" (possibly for some sort of ""roots"") for arbitrary $f\in\mathbb{Z}[[x]]$ . Write $F'/F = \sum -\alpha_i r_i/(1-r_i x)$ as $P/Q$ with $P\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ coprime to $Q = D\prod (1-r_ix)\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ ( $D\ne0$ chosen so $Q$ , and therefore $P$ , has integer coefficients). By Bezout's identity, there exist $A,B\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ such that $AP+BQ = c$ for some nonzero integer $c$ , so $$c/Q = (AP+BQ)/Q = A(P/Q)+B \in \mathbb{Z}[[x]].$$ By Gauss's lemma (for formal power series), the only way $c = Q(c/Q)$ can occur is if $Q(0)$ and $(c/Q)(0)$ (which multiply to $c$ ) are the gcd's of the coefficients of $Q$ and $c/Q$ , respectively, so $Q/Q(0) = \prod(1-r_ix)$ has integer coefficients, as desired. So in that vein, I would be interested in some version of Bezout's identity for integer formal power series. (Especially one that helps for the formal power series version of the problem.) Of course, to actually use such a fact, we would have to first factor out a gcd of $f$ and $f'$ (in $\mathbb{Z}[[x]]$ ), as when we have multiple roots in the polynomial case.","I am curious about the following problem from MIT's Problem Solving Seminar (#25 in https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/121169/18-s34-fall-2007/contents/assignments/cong.pdf ): Let be a formal power series with integer coefficients, such that .

66,Polynomials whose fractional part behaves like a logarithm,Polynomials whose fractional part behaves like a logarithm,,"For a given integer $m$ , I'm looking for a classification of all polynomials $P$ with rational coefficients satisfying the logarithm-like condition $$P(ab)=P(a)+P(b) \pmod 1$$ for any integers $a, b$ coprime to $m$ . I'm interested in these polynomials because they can be used to define Dirichlet characters of the form $$\chi_P(n) = \begin{cases} 0, & \gcd(n,m)>1 \\ e^{2\pi i P(n)}, & \gcd(n,m)=1\end{cases},$$ using the fact that the sequence $n \mapsto P(n) \pmod 1$ is periodic for any rational polynomial $P$ . I consider two rational polynomials equivalent if they induce the same polynomial function modulo $1$ on integers coprime to $m$ , i.e., if the associated characters are the same. Note that the logarithm-like condition implies that $P(1) = 0 \pmod 1$ , so up to equivalence it can be assumed that $P(1) = 0$ , that is, $(x-1)|P$ . The only examples of logarithm-like polynomials I've been able to find so far are equivalent to integral linear combinations of the degree $N$ polynomials $$P_{N,m}(x)=\frac{x^N - 1}{\Delta_{N,m}^2},$$ where $\Delta_{N,m} = \gcd\limits_{(a,m) \text{ coprime}}(a^N-1)$ . It is easy to prove that these polynomials satisfy the logarithm-like condition by an argument similar to the one in this answer . Not all of these polynomials will be inequivalent in general, e.g. all the polynomials with $N$ odd are equivalent to each other. For instance, if we fix $m=k!$ , in the limit of big $k$ the resulting sequence of polynomials $P_{N}(x) = \lim_{k\to \infty} P_{N,k!}(x)$ becomes $$P_{1}(x) = \frac{x-1}{2^2}, \: P_{2}(x) = \frac{x^2-1}{24^2}, \: P_{3}(x) = \frac{x^3-1}{2^2}, \: P_{4}(x) = \frac{x^4-1}{240^2}, \: P_{5}(x) = \frac{x^5-1}{2^2}, \: P_{6}(x) = \frac{x^6-1}{504^2}, \cdots$$ (as a curiosity, $\Delta_{N}$ for $N>1$ equals twice the denominator of the rational number $\zeta(1-N)$ , where $\zeta$ is the Riemann zeta function). Note that $P_{N,m}$ is an integral multiple of $P_N$ for any $m$ , so all the examples I know can be expressed up to equivalence as $\sum_{N=1}^{N_{\text{max}}} a_N P_N(x)$ with $a_N \in \mathbb{Z}$ . Are there any other examples, up to equivalence? EDIT: Here is a possible strategy to show that the examples above are the only ones. Consider a polynomial $P(x) = \sum_{N=0}^{N_{\text{max}}} p_N x^N$ with $p_N \in \mathbb{Q}$ that satisfies the logarithm-like condition for some $m$ . This condition can be reexpressed as $$\mathbb{Z} \ni P(ab)-P(a)-P(b) = \sum_{N=0}^{N_{\text{max}}} p_N ((ab)^N-a^N-b^N) =$$ $$= \sum_{N=0}^{N_{\text{max}}} p_N (a^N-1)(b^N-1) - \sum_{N=0}^{N_{\text{max}}} p_N.$$ But the last sum is equal to $P(1)$ , which by the remarks above may be taken to vanish. Hence we must have $$\sum_{N=0}^{N_{\text{max}}} p_N (a^N-1)(b^N-1) = \sum_{N=0}^{N_{\text{max}}} q_N \frac{a^N-1}{\Delta_{N,m}}\frac{b^N-1}{\Delta_{N,m}} \in \mathbb{Z},$$ where $q_N = p_N \Delta_{N,m}^2$ . This must hold true as $a,b$ range over all integers coprime to $m$ . If we can show that $q_N \in \mathbb{Z}$ for all $N$ , we will have proved that $P(x) = P(x)-P(1) = \sum_{N=0}^{N_{\text{max}}} q_N (x^N-1)/\Delta_{N,m}^2$ is an integral linear combination of $P_{N,m}(x)$ , and thus that the answer to my question is negative. Showing that the $q_N$ are integers for all $m$ amounts to showing that the set of vectors $$\Sigma_m = \left\{ \left(\frac{a-1}{\Delta_{1,m}}\cdot\frac{b-1}{\Delta_{1,m}}, \frac{a^2-1}{\Delta_{2,m}}\cdot\frac{b^2-1}{\Delta_{2,m}}, \ldots, \frac{a^{N_{\text{max}}}-1}{\Delta_{N_{\text{max}},m}}\cdot\frac{b^{N_{\text{max}}}-1}{\Delta_{N_{\text{max}},m}} \right) \middle\vert a,b \text{ coprime to } m \right\},$$ whose entries are integral by definition of $\Delta_{N,m}$ , is a spanning set for $\mathbb{Z}^{N_{\text{max}}}$ , since in that case the covector $(q_1,q_2,\ldots, q_{N_{\text{max}}})$ must belong to the dual lattice of $\mathbb{Z}^{N_{\text{max}}}$ , which is again $\mathbb{Z}^{N_{\text{max}}}$ . This seems intuitively plausible after some numerical experimentation (it says that the numbers $\frac{a^N-1}{\Delta_{N,m}}$ for $N=1, 2, \ldots$ are essentially ""uncorrelated""), and it can be easily checked for specific values of $m$ , but I'm not sure how to prove that it holds in general for arbitrary $m$ and $N_{\text{max}}$ . EDIT 2: The problem is more interesting than I thought: the proof strategy above fails because, as I just found, there do exist logarithm-like polynomials for which $q_N$ are noninteger. Two of these are $\frac12 P_{2,3} + \frac12 P_{1,3}$ and $\frac1{12} P_{3,2} - \frac1{12} P_{1,2}$ . I had missed them before because they turn out to be equivalent to polynomials with integer $q_N$ . E.g. the former polynomial is equivalent to $-P_{2,3}$ , and the latter is $4P_{2,2}$ . I still suspect that any logarithm-like polynomial is equivalent to one of that form, but the existence of these equivalences somewhat complicates things. As suggested by Merosity in the comments, another possible idea is to work one prime at a time by taking the $p$ -adic fractional part. We have $\{P_N\}_p = k_p P_{N,p}$ , where $k_p$ is some integer coprime to $p$ , so any logarithmic-like polynomial can be decomposed into (finitely many) $p$ -parts $P \cong \sum_p \{P\}_p$ , where each $\{P\}_p$ would be then conjecturally equivalent to an integral linear combination of $P_{N,p}$ . The problem would thus reduce to trying to prove the cases with $m=p$ first, and then finding a way to combine each individual proof into one that works for composite $m$ . A possible advantage of this approach is that $\Delta_{N,p}$ has a very simple expression (for odd primes it is $\Delta_{N,p}=p^{r+1}$ where $r$ is the maximum integer such that $p^r(p-1)|N$ , and for $p=2$ it's something similar but slightly different). However, even in this simplified setting one runs into ""exotic"" equivalences like the ones above, so I haven't been able to make much progress so far. EDIT 3: I apologize for so many edits, this is the last one for a while. I still haven't made progress on a proof, but I can't help but mention that the same phenomenon seems to hold for many other number rings $R$ , such as the Gaussian and Eisenstein integers $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ and $\mathbb{Z}[\omega]$ , or even orders in function fields like $\mathbb{F}_q[t]$ , if we replace $P(x)$ by $P(|x|)$ , where $|x|$ is the canonical (integer-valued, multiplicative) norm, and let $m$ be any element of $R$ . We then have that $\Delta^{(R)}_{N,m}$ (under the same definition as above) is related to the denominator of the Dedekind or Hasse-Weil zeta function associated to $R$ , and the corresponding $P^{(R)}_N(|x|)$ again seem to form an integral spanning set of the logarithm-like ""norm polynomials"" valued in $R$ , up to equivalence. I wonder if my conjecture would be easier to prove or disprove over some of these rings instead of $\mathbb{Z}$ ; I don't have much experience working with function fields myself, but I do know that proofs are sometimes easier to find in that setting. For now I'm adding a bounty since I ran out of ideas. Any answer that makes a significant step towards the classification (over some ring) would be appreciated, even if it's not a full proof.","For a given integer , I'm looking for a classification of all polynomials with rational coefficients satisfying the logarithm-like condition for any integers coprime to .

EDIT: Here is a possible strategy to show that the examples above are the only ones. Consider a polynomial with that satisfies the logarithm-like condition for some . This condition can be reexpressed as But the last sum is equal to , which by the remarks above may be taken to vanish. Hence we must have where . This must hold true as range over all integers coprime to . If we can show that for all , we will have proved that is an integral linear combination of , and thus that the answer to my question is negative. Showing that the are integers for all amounts to showing that the set of vectors whose entries are integral by definition of , is a spanning set for , since in that case the covector must belong to the dual lattice of , which is again . This seems intuitively plausible after some numerical experimentation (it says that the numbers for are essentially ""uncorrelated""), and it can be easily checked for specific values of , but I'm not sure how to prove that it holds in general for arbitrary and . EDIT 2: The problem is more interesting than I thought: the proof strategy above fails because, as I just found, there do exist logarithm-like polynomials for which are noninteger. Two of these are and . I had missed them before because they turn out to be equivalent to polynomials with integer . E.g. the former polynomial is equivalent to , and the latter is . I still suspect that any logarithm-like polynomial is equivalent to one of that form, but the existence of these equivalences somewhat complicates things. As suggested by Merosity in the comments, another possible idea is to work one prime at a time by taking the -adic fractional part. We have , where is some integer coprime to , so any logarithmic-like polynomial can be decomposed into (finitely many) -parts , where each would be then conjecturally equivalent to an integral linear combination of . The problem would thus reduce to trying to prove the cases with first, and then finding a way to combine each individual proof into one that works for composite . A possible advantage of this approach is that has a very simple expression (for odd primes it is where is the maximum integer such that , and for it's something similar but slightly different). However, even in this simplified setting one runs into ""exotic"" equivalences like the ones above, so I haven't been able to make much progress so far. EDIT 3: I apologize for so many edits, this is the last one for a while. I still haven't made progress on a proof, but I can't help but mention that the same phenomenon seems to hold for many other number rings , such as the Gaussian and Eisenstein integers and , or even orders in function fields like , if we replace by , where is the canonical (integer-valued, multiplicative) norm, and let be any element of . We then have that (under the same definition as above) is related to the denominator of the Dedekind or Hasse-Weil zeta function associated to , and the corresponding again seem to form an integral spanning set of the logarithm-like ""norm polynomials"" valued in , up to equivalence. I wonder if my conjecture would be easier to prove or disprove over some of these rings instead of ; I don't have much experience working with function fields myself, but I do know that proofs are sometimes easier to find in that setting. For now I'm adding a bounty since I ran out of ideas. Any answer that makes a significant step towards the classification (over some ring) would be appreciated, even if it's not a full proof.","m P P(ab)=P(a)+P(b) \pmod 1 a, b m \chi_P(n) = \begin{cases} 0, & \gcd(n,m)>1 \\ e^{2\pi i P(n)}, & \gcd(n,m)=1\end{cases}, n \mapsto P(n) \pmod 1 P 1 m P(1) = 0 \pmod 1 P(1) = 0 (x-1)|P N P_{N,m}(x)=\frac{x^N - 1}{\Delta_{N,m}^2}, \Delta_{N,m} = \gcd\limits_{(a,m) \text{ coprime}}(a^N-1) N m=k! k P_{N}(x) = \lim_{k\to \infty} P_{N,k!}(x) P_{1}(x) = \frac{x-1}{2^2}, \: P_{2}(x) = \frac{x^2-1}{24^2}, \: P_{3}(x) = \frac{x^3-1}{2^2}, \: P_{4}(x) = \frac{x^4-1}{240^2}, \: P_{5}(x) = \frac{x^5-1}{2^2}, \: P_{6}(x) = \frac{x^6-1}{504^2}, \cdots \Delta_{N} N>1 \zeta(1-N) \zeta P_{N,m} P_N m \sum_{N=1}^{N_{\text{max}}} a_N P_N(x) a_N \in \mathbb{Z} P(x) = \sum_{N=0}^{N_{\text{max}}} p_N x^N p_N \in \mathbb{Q} m \mathbb{Z} \ni P(ab)-P(a)-P(b) = \sum_{N=0}^{N_{\text{max}}} p_N ((ab)^N-a^N-b^N) = = \sum_{N=0}^{N_{\text{max}}} p_N (a^N-1)(b^N-1) - \sum_{N=0}^{N_{\text{max}}} p_N.

I have two questions. Firstly and mainly, $1.$ Existence : Does every number base $b\ge 4$ contain at least one Baseless number? Status: Currently $b=107$ is the smallest base with no known examples. Secondly and supplementary, $2.$ Solving decimal base : Is number $8385$ the only decimal Baseless number? Solved: This was now proven to be true by an exhaustive search. $2.$ Baseless numbers in decimal number base Is number $8385$ the only decimal Baseless number?

Can we prove that $E_{10}(a)\ne 0$ for all $a\ge 2$ other than $a=8385$ ? I have looked at which point will $E(a)\gt 0$ for all $a\gt a_0$ for some $a_0$ : We know that $f_{b}(a)$ of a $d$ -digit number is at most $u_b(d)=\sum_{i=1}^{d+1}(b-1)^{i}$ , the case when all digits are set to $(b-1)$ , the largest base $b$ digit. We also know that a $d$ -digit number is at least $l_b(d)=b^{d-1}$ . But notice that we can't have a zero digit in the number $a$ because then $f_b(a)$ automatically has less digits than $a$ , so we can improve the lower bound to $l_b(d)=\sum_{i=1}^{d}b^{d-i}$ . Hence, we try to find all $d$ for which $u_b\lt l_b$ . For $b=10$ we have: $$\frac98 (-1 + 9^{d+1})\lt\frac19 (-1 + 10^d) \space\space\text{ if }\space\space d\gt 42.8266$$ That is, we know that if $a$ has $d\ge43$ digits, then $f_{10}(a)$ has less than $d$ digits. In other words, we have $f_{10}(a)\lt a$ , implying $E_{10}(a)\gt 0$ for all $a\ge 10^{42}$ . This means if there is a second solution for the decimal number base, it must be $a \lt 10^{42}$ . That is, so far I have that if there is a second example, it is $a\in[10^{10},10^{42}]$ . Can we somehow lower this bound or remove significant families of numbers from it?

I've posted this result as my own partial answer. $1.$ Existence in other number bases It is not hard to see that $b=2$ has no examples, and for $b=3$ we can prove there are no examples by checking all numbers up to $10^5$ . (Following the bound given in the previous section, larger numbers than this have $E_3(a)\gt 0$ ). Hence from now on, assume $b\ge 4$ . Does every number base $b\ge 4$ contain at least one Baseless number? It appears every base has a very small amount in total, if any. Generally, to solve for all $d$ digit examples in base $b$ , we have the Diophantine equation: $$ a=\sum_{i=1}^{d} a_{i}b^{d-i} = \sum_{i=1}^{d}a_i^2\prod_{j=i+1}^da_j = f_b(a)\tag{$\star$} $$ In digits $0\lt a_1,\dots,a_d\lt b$ . The question is now, is it true that: For all $b\ge 4$ there exists $d\ge 2$ such that $(\star)$ has at least one solution for the digits? For example, if the number base is a perfect square $b=r^2$ , then we have a trivial $2$ -digit example: $$ a=\overline{(1,\sqrt{b})}_b=((1) b+\sqrt{b})=((1) 1 + \sqrt{b})\sqrt{b}=f_b(a) $$ This is because if we set $d=2$ in $(\star)$ we get $a_1b + a_2 = a_1^2a_2+a_2^2$ . Now specially for $a_1=1$ it reduces to $a_2^2=b$ implying that if $b$ is a perfect square, then the number $\overline{(1,\sqrt{b})}_b=b+\sqrt{b}$ is a Baseless number in the base $b$ . If we look at $d=2$ in general, all solutions below base $100$ are in this pastebin table $(d=2)$ . If we look at $d=3$ , almost all bases below $100$ have one or more $3$ -digit Baseless number examples. You can see the list of all solutions in this pastebin table $(d=3)$ . And so on.

That's how long the sequence had to be to get all $11$ of the ""small"" primes, i.e. primes no bigger than $\sqrt{1350}$. A reason to care about this is that if one wants to factor an integer in this range, one looks at its distances from each of those first $11$ primes to decide whether it's divisible by any of them, and if not, then it's prime. So one need not search beyond that sequence. I lean toward taking $f(1)$, $f(2)$, and $f(3)$ to be $0$ since no prime numbers are $\le$ the square roots of those numbers.  But that would require a slight rephrasing of the definition of $f$, and I'm not immediately sure how best to do that. So here's my question: Is this a known function?  Does it have a standard name?  Are the theorems of interest concerning it?  What books give an account of it?

Hence $f(1350)=16$. $$ \begin{array}{crlc} \text{count} & & \text{factorization} & \text{small primes seen so far} \\ \hline 1 & 1349 & = 19\cdot71 & 19 \\ 2 & 1350 & = 2\cdot3\cdot3\cdot3\cdot5\cdot5 & 2,3,5,19 \\ 3 & 1351 & = 7\cdot191 & 2,3,5,7,19 \\ 4 & 1352 & = 2\cdot2\cdot2\cdot13\cdot13 & 2,3,5,7,13,19 \\ 5 & 1353 & = 3\cdot11\cdot41 & 2,3,5,7,11,13,19 \\ 6 & 1354 & = 2\cdot677 & \text{ditto (no new ones this time)} \\ 7 & 1355 & = 5\cdot271 & \text{ditto} \\ 8 & 1356 & = 2\cdot2\cdot3\cdot113 & \text{ditto} \\ 9 & 1357 & = 23\cdot59 & 2,3,5,7,11,13,19,23 \\ 10 & 1358 & = 2\cdot7\cdot97 & \text{ditto} \\ 11 & 1359 & = 3\cdot3\cdot151 & \text{ditto} \\ 12 & 1360 & =2\cdot2\cdot2\cdot2\cdot5\cdot17 & 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23 \\ 13 & 1361 & = 1361 & \text{ditto} \\ 14 & 1362 & = 2\cdot3\cdot227 & \text{ditto} \\ 15 & 1363 & = 29\cdot27 & 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29 \\ 16 & 1364 & = 2\cdot2\cdot11\cdot31 & 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31 \end{array} $$ The ""$\text{count}$"" is $16$, so that is $f(1350)$.  That's how long the sequence had to be to get all $11$ of the ""small"" primes, i.e. primes no bigger than $\sqrt{1350}$. A reason to care about this is that if one wants to factor an integer in this range, one looks at its distances from each of those first $11$ primes to decide whether it's divisible by any of them, and if not, then it's prime. So one need not search beyond that sequence. I lean toward taking $f(1)$, $f(2)$, and $f(3)$ to be $0$ since no prime numbers are $\le$ the square roots of those numbers.  But that would require a slight rephrasing of the definition of $f$, and I'm not immediately sure how best to do that. So here's my question: Is this a known function?  Does it have a standard name?  Are the theorems of interest concerning it?  What books give an account of it?  (Confession: I haven't yet checked OEIS for it.)",,"['number-theory', 'reference-request']"

The digits on the watch were providing a quadruplet of positive integers that satisfy the following system of equations: $$\begin{align} a^b &= cd \\ b^a &= c+d \end{align}$$ I wondered what the set of all positive integer solutions of this system was. Writing $d=b^a-c,$ I obtained a quadratic of $c$ with coefficients in terms of $a$ and $b$ , which led me to the following: $$\left\{ c,d \right\} = \left\{\frac{b^a-\sqrt{b^{2a}-4a^b}}{2},\frac{b^a+\sqrt{b^{2a}-4a^b}}{2}\right\}$$ Therefore, given positive integers $a$ and $b,$ there is a solution if and only if $b^{2a}-4a^b$ is a perfect square. A brute force search using this result yields the following solutions: $(1,2,1,1),$ $(2,2,2,2),$ $(2,3,1,8),$ and $(2,3,8,1).$ I believe that there is no other solution than these.

At  least one powerfull enough to prove $ \sum_{k=l+1}^{2l-1} a_k \, 5^k \neq 0$ for all $l$ bigger than some effective bound ?.",,"['number-theory', 'algebraic-number-theory', 'p-adic-number-theory']"

Anyone knows another one? (with $n \gt 2$ and $k\gt0$ ) I am also interested in any necessary conditions on $n$ and $k$ for $\sum_{i=1}^n i^{2k}$ to be prime. Clearly neither $n$ nor $n+1$ can be a multiple of $4$ . More generally, if $q$ is an odd prime number such that $q-1$ divides $2k$ , $n$ cannot be $ 0\bmod {q^2} $ otherwise $$\sum_{i=1}^n i^{2k}\equiv \sum_{i\le n ,\mathrm {gcd}(i,q)=1} 1 = n-\lfloor {\frac{n}{q}}\rfloor \equiv 0 \pmod q $$ and cannot be a prime number. Then $n$ cannot be a multiple of $9$ . Also if $q$ is an odd prime number such that $q-1$ divides $2k$ , $n+1$ cannot be $0  \bmod {q^2} $ either, otherwise $$\sum_{i=1}^n i^{2k}=\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} i^{2k}-(n+1)^{2k}\equiv \sum_{i\le n+1 ,\mathrm {gcd}(i,q)=1} 1 = n+1-\lfloor {\frac{n+1}{q}}\rfloor \equiv 0 \pmod q $$ and cannot be a prime number. Then $n+1$ cannot be a multiple of $9$ either. And also if $q$ is an odd prime number such that $q-1$ divides $2k$ , $2n+1$ cannot be $0 \bmod {q^2} $ either, otherwise $$\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^{2k}=\sum_{i=1}^{2n+1} i^{2k}-\sum_{i=n+1}^{2n+1} i^{2k}=\sum_{i=1}^{2n+1} i^{2k}-\sum_{i=0}^{n} (2n+1-i)^{2k}$$ $$\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^{2k} \equiv \sum_{\underset{i\le 2n+1 }{\mathrm {gcd}(i,q)=1}} 1- \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^{2k}\equiv 2n+1-\lfloor {\frac{2n+1}{q}}\rfloor - n +\lfloor {\frac{n}{q}}\rfloor \equiv - n +\lfloor {\frac{n}{q}}\rfloor\pmod q.$$ But neither $n$ nor $n+1$ is multiple of $q$ , otherwise both would be (since $q$ divides $2n+1$ ) which is impossible since $n$ and $n+1$ are coprime. Then $\lfloor {\frac{n}{q}}\rfloor=\lfloor {\frac{n+1}{q}}\rfloor$ , then $$\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^{2k} \equiv  - n +\lfloor {\frac{n}{q}} \rfloor\equiv 2n+1-n+\lfloor {\frac{n+1}{q}} \rfloor\equiv n+1+\lfloor {\frac{n+1}{q}} \rfloor\pmod q,$$ then $$2\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^{2k} \equiv  1 +\lfloor {\frac{n}{q}} \rfloor+\lfloor {\frac{n+1}{q}} \rfloor\pmod q.$$ But $$\frac{2n+1}{q}-1=\lfloor {\frac{2n+1}{q}} \rfloor-1 \le \lfloor {\frac{n}{q}} \rfloor+\lfloor {\frac{n+1}{q}} \rfloor \le \lfloor {\frac{2n+1}{q}} \rfloor= \frac{2n+1}{q} $$ and $$\lfloor {\frac{n}{q}} \rfloor+\lfloor {\frac{n+1}{q}}\rfloor \neq \frac{2n+1}{q} $$ then $$\frac{2n+1}{q}-1= \lfloor {\frac{n}{q}} \rfloor+\lfloor {\frac{n+1}{q}} \rfloor $$ $$2\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^{2k} \equiv  \frac{2n+1}{q}\equiv 0 \pmod q$$ $$\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^{2k} \equiv 0 \pmod q$$ and cannot be a prime number. Then $2n+1$ cannot be a multiple of $9$ either. So we have shown that $n(n+1)(2n+1)$ cannot be divisible by $4$ nor by $9$ and  I can show that a more general necessary condition is that $n(n+1)(2n+1)$ is squarefree. The proof is hereafter in the Appendix. I also wonder whether another necessary condition is that the prime divisors of $2k$ are smaller than or equal to those of $n$ . But we only have $1440=2^5\cdot3^2\cdot 5$ and the Fermat primes to support this. Appendix Let $\mathrm{rad}(n)$ be the product of the distinct prime factors of $n$ . The purpose of this appendix is to show that when $k\ge1$ , we have $$\sum_{i=1}^n j^{2k} \equiv 0 \bmod {\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{\mathrm{rad} \big(n(n+1)(2n+1)\big)}}$$ whence if $n(n+1)(2n+1)$ is not squarefree, then $\sum_{i=1}^n j^{2k}$ is composite. We first observe that it suffices to show that $S_{2k}(n):=\sum_{j=1}^nj^{2k}$ is divisible by $\frac{n}{\mathrm{rad}(n)}$ . Indeed $n$ and $n+1$ are coprime and $S_{2k}(n)= S_{2k}(n+1)-(n+1)^{2k}$ is then also divisible by $\frac{n+1}{\mathrm{rad}(n+1)}$ , since $(n+1)^{2k}$ is divisible by $(n+1)^{2}$ , hence by $\frac{n+1)}{\mathrm{rad}(n+1)}$ . Also $n$ and $2n+1$ are coprime and $S_{2k}(n)= S_{2k}(2n+1)-\sum_{i=n+1}^{2n+1}i^{2k}=S_{2k}(2n+1)-\sum_{i=0}^{n}(2n+1-i)^{2k}$ , then $$S_{2k}(n)\equiv -\sum_{i=1}^{n}i^{2k}= -S_{2k}(n)\bmod {\frac{2n+1}{\mathrm{rad}(2n+1)}} $$ then $$2S_{2k}(n)\equiv 0\bmod {\frac{2n+1}{\mathrm{rad}(2n+1)}} $$ then $$S_{2k}(n)\equiv 0\bmod {\frac{2n+1}{\mathrm{rad}(2n+1)}} $$ Let $q$ be a prime divisor of $n$ . By @reuns remark in the comment, $\sum_{j=1}^{n} j^{2k}\equiv \frac{n}{q}\sum_{j=1}^{q-1}j^{2k} \bmod q$ and this clearly shows that $\sum_{j=1}^{n} j^{2k}\equiv 0 \bmod q$ when $q^2$ divides $n$ . $\square$","When , we know 4 Fermat primes (among the 5 which are known) satisfying this condition: One may wonder for what other values of , it holds that is a prime number.

81,Showing that the Prime Number Theorem is Plausible.,Showing that the Prime Number Theorem is Plausible.,,"I have started to work through the course notes titled ""Integers, Polynomials and Finite Fields"" by Kenneth Davidson to keep me busy this summer, and there is a question in here This is an exercise to show that the prime number theorem is plausible. (a) Use the integral test to show that the following series converge. $$\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n(\log n)^2}$$ and $$\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^2}$$ (b) Show that $\pi(n) > \frac{n}{(\log n)}$ infinitely many times. $\textbf{Hint:}$ Show that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes between $2^{k-1}$ and $2^k$ is at most $2^{1-k} \pi({2^k})$. Use this to estimate the sum of the reciprocals of all primes. part (a) is straight foreward, however I am having some trouble with (b). I came across this on my search for clues as how to solve it, but the solution assumes the prime number theorem is true , which I obviously cannot do (unless im supposed to use it to see if I end up with a reasonable answer).

(a) Use the integral test to show that the following series converge. $$\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n(\log n)^2}$$ and $$\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^2}$$ (b) Show that $\pi(n) > \frac{n}{(\log n)}$ infinitely many times. $\textbf{Hint:}$ Show that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes between $2^{k-1}$ and $2^k$ is at most $2^{1-k} \pi({2^k})$.

82,Why are there palindromic subsequences at random among this sequence?,Why are there palindromic subsequences at random among this sequence?,,"So I was thinking about the Goldbach conjecture and I rephrased it to myself as the following: Prove that every number N is either prime or else lies halfway between two primes A and B, where A < N and N < B < 2N . This is equivalent, because if it were true, then the following would apply: For any even number X where X/2 is prime, you know X is expressible by the sum of two primes: X/2 + X/2. (e.g. for 10, 10/2 is 5 and 5+5=10) For any even number X where X/2 is NOT prime, you know X is expressible by the sum of two primes: A + B, where A and B are whichever two primes X/2 lies between. (e.g. for 12, 12/2 is 6 and 6 is halfway between 5 and 7, and 5+7=12) And thus the Goldbach Conjecture would be proven true, because all even numbers are proven to be expressible as the sum of two primes. So then I went and generated the first 400 values for N of the sequence where N is ""the shortest distance  from X to the nearest prime number both above and below it"" where X is the natural numbers 1, 2, 3, etc. If X is prime, N is 0.

I quote: ""Faltings was able to prove that, because these shapes always have more than one hole, the associated Fermat equation could only have a finite number of whole number solutions."" Surely, now all that is needed is to prove that a Fermat equation has infinite solutions. Suppose we take the original equation: $$A^3 + B^3 = C^3$$ Surely we can find infinite solutions to this by doubling $A, B, C$ $$(2A)^3 + (2B)^3 = (2C)^3$$ $$8A^3 + 8B^3 = 8C^3$$ $$A^3 + B^3 = C^3$$ Surely this means there are infinitely many solutions to these equations. But now we have a contradiction, so therefore our original assumption, that $A^3 + B^3 = C^3$ has solutions, is false. Who can point out my error as this seems a very simple step to take from Falting's to Fermat's.
