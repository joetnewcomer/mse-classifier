Euler solved the Basel Problem and how he found the exact value of $\zeta(2n)$ up to $n=13$.

A little while later I stumbled upon this website and fixated my eyeballs on equation (27). If we take $n=3$, Prudnikov et al. tell us that  $$  \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} \Big(1-\frac{x^3}{k^3}\Big) = - \frac{1}{x^3} \cdot \prod_{k=1}^{2} \frac{1}{\Gamma(-e^{2/3 \pi i k} \cdot x)}.  $$ Now, I thought that if we could use Newton's Identities again on the left side of the equation and find out what the Taylor Series Expansion of the right-hand side would be, we could find out what the exact value of Apery's Constant and other odd zeta-constants would be. In this answer by Robert Smith, I was told the Series Expansion. So we have  $$  1 - x^3(1 + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{27} + ... + \frac{1}{n^3}) = -1 - 2 \cdot \gamma x - 2 \gamma^2 x^2 + \frac{1}{6}x^3(-8\gamma^3 - \psi^{(2)} (1)) - x^4(...) $$ Notice that on the left side we only have 'one minus a term with an $x^3$ coefficient', while on the other side we see 'minus one plus $x$, $x^2$, $x^3$ coefficients with their terms'. This is important, because it probably answers the question why the following will not work, but I don't know why and I really would like to know. I guess you know what I will attempt to do now. We equate the $x^3$ terms with each other, set $x=1$, multiply by minus one and 'find' that  $$ \zeta(3) = \frac{1}{6}(8\gamma^3 + \psi^{(2)} (1)).  $$ By combining this with the already known result  $$  \zeta(3) = -\frac{1}{2} \psi^{2}(1), $$ we 'find' that  $$ \zeta(3) '=' \gamma^3. $$ Obviously, this is wrong. Apery's constant is larger than one, and this value is clearly smaller than one. Could someone please elaborate one where I went wrong?

Further, on equating coefficients of $q^{4/5}$ on both sides, he gets the beautiful result $$\sum_{n = 0}^{\infty}p(5n + 4)q^{n} = 5\frac{\{(1 - q^{5})(1 - q^{10})(1 - q^{15})\cdots\}^{5}}{\{(1 - q)(1 - q^{2})(1 - q^{3})\cdots\}^{6}}$$ which can be used to show $$\begin{aligned}p(5n + 4) &\equiv 0\pmod{5}\\p(25n + 24) &\equiv 0\pmod{25}\end{aligned}$$ (this is shown in detail in my blog post ). Next Ramanujan mentions that the same technique can be applied by analyzing $$\sum_{n = 0}^{\infty}p(n)q^{n/7} = \frac{1}{f(-q^{1/7})}$$ and equating the coefficient of $q^{5/7},$ to get another beautiful identity $$\sum_{n = 0}^{\infty}p(7n + 5)q^{n} = 7\frac{\{(1 - q^{7})(1 - q^{14})(1 - q^{21})\cdots\}^{3}}{\{(1 - q)(1 - q^{2})(1 - q^{3})\cdots\}^{4}} + 49q\frac{\{(1 - q^{7})(1 - q^{14})(1 - q^{21})\cdots\}^{7}}{\{(1 - q)(1 - q^{2})(1 - q^{3})\cdots\}^{8}}$$ This can be used to prove the congruences $$\begin{aligned}p(7n + 5) &\equiv 0\pmod{7}\\p(49n + 47) &\equiv 0\pmod{49}\end{aligned}$$ Unfortunately, in his characteristic style, Ramanujan omits the proof for the case of $f(-q^{1/7})$. I tried to use the approach mentioned by Ramanujan for $f(-q^{1/7})$ and was led to rather cumbersome expressions (multiplying three almost similar polynomials of 6 degrees each with symbolic coefficients). Needless to say, none of the online symbolic packages like wolfram alpha or sympy handle such complex symbolic manipulation. I guess that Ramanujan must have somehow simplified these calculations and thereby obtained a very simple-looking result.

Further, if we replace $r = q^{1/7}$ by $r\zeta^{i}$ for $i = 1, 2, \ldots, 6$, where $\zeta$ is a primitive $7^{\text{th}}$ root of unity, then the product $Q = \prod_{i = 0}^{6}f(-r\zeta^{i})$ can be expressed without any fractional powers of $q$. In fact it is easy to show that $$Q = \prod_{i = 0}^{6}f(-r\zeta^{i}) = \frac{f^{8}(-q)}{f(-q^{7})}$$ The idea is then to find $Q/P = \prod_{i = 1}^{6}f(-r\zeta^{i})$, and we try to find the coefficient of $r^{5}$ in $Q/P$. Suppose that the coefficient is $R$.

19,How strong is the Second Ratio Test?,How strong is the Second Ratio Test?,,"The Second Ratio Test is a relatively new convergence test, which we can give as Let $\sum_n a_n$ be a series with positive terms. For $k \in \{0,1\}$ we write $$ L_k = \limsup_{n \to \infty} a_{2n+k}/a_n , \quad l_k = \liminf_{n \to \infty} a_{2n+k}/a_n $$ If $ \max\{ L_0,L_1 \} < 1/2 ,$ $\sum_n a_n$ converges. If $ \min\{ l_0,l_1 \} > 1/2 , $ $\sum_n a_n$ diverges. Otherwise, the test is inconclusive. (The second condition can probably be replaced by $a_{2n+k}/a_n \geq 1$ for all sufficiently large $n$ if we want to be as strong as possible.) We recall that a convergence test A is stronger than one B if A resolves the convergence/divergence of any series that B resolves. (One may wish to separate the convergence test from the divergence test for greater specificity.) For example, we all know that the Root Test is stronger than the Ratio Test. A natural question is thus if the Second Ratio Test has a similar relationship to the Root Test, or other more venerable tests. Currently known: The Second Ratio Test resolves the convergence/divergence of the $p$ -series $\sum_n n^{-p}$ , for $p \neq 1$ anyway. The Root Test does not. The Second Ratio Test is stronger than the Ratio Test and Raabe's Test, at least on the convergence side. These are proved in this paper cited in the Wikipedia article . Also: The Second Ratio Test requires $a_n \neq 0$ , whereas the Root Test avoids this. But this still raises the question of whether one is stronger than the other in their common domain of validity. The Second Ratio Test is not as strong as the Condensation Test where both apply: it does not resolve $n^{-1} (\log n)^{-p}$ , whereas the Condensation Test does. But the Condensation Test requires a monotonically decreasing sequence of terms. In this case, there is a follow-up paper that discusses more general cases. More interestingly, Bertrand's Test (third in the De Morgan Hierarchy) does resolve $n^{-1} (\log n)^{-p}$ , so the Second Ratio Test is not stronger than Bertrand's Test.

If that one gets answered, I'll probably accept the answer given below (although I'm uncertain of whether or not this is the community standard; if you know, please let me know). I've found a sequence $x_{i+1}=\|x_i(2+k)\|$, where $k=1+2\sqrt{2}$ and where $||a||$ rounds $a$ to the nearest integer, that seems to minimize the distance $P_n$ to an integer solution (for $x$ and $y$) of the equation in the title. $P_n$ is more rigorously defined as the absolute value of $\|y_n\|-y_n$, where $y_n=nk$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Starting with $x_0=1$ the sequence becomes $x_1=\|2+k\|=\|5.83\ldots\|=6,x_2=\|6(2+k)\|=\|34.97\ldots\|=35,204,1189,6930,\ldots$ where $P_i$ very quickly becomes small. In Fig. 1 below, I've plotted $P_n$ for $n$. In Fig. 2 only low values of $P$ is shown and it seems that the $P_i$'s from the sequence (in red) are the lowest value up until that $n$ (I've checked this up to $n=10^6$). My main question is this: Why does this sequence give the solutions nearest integer-solutions? (Edit for further clarification:) And why are these the nearest up until that point (see Fig. 2)? Can it be proven, starting from the original equation, that the elements in this sequence will give the best approximations to integers up until that point, e.g. that it's error dies off faster than all other possible sequences?

I haven't really studied dynamical systems, so if you could dumb it down a bit, I'd be grateful. Also, as seen in Fig. 1, there's a high degree of regularity here, with all the seemingly straight lines. If I remove the absolute value-part of the def. of $P_n$ the cross-pattern in Fig. 1 becomes (seemingly) straight, parallel declining lines. Why do these lines form? Could it be explained via some modular arithmetic? Fig. 3 Thanks! EDIT: Changed ""Bonus"" to ""Further"", as I would also really like to hear answers to these questions.

I can show this lower bound using the fact that the sum of the elements in any row of pascal's triangle is a power of two. For each element of the sequence $S_m$ given by $f_m(a)$ where $0 \le a \le m$ , $f_m(a)$ is the sum of a full row of pascal's triangle (plus a couple of zeros), and thus is a power of two. This gives a lower bound of at least $m+1$ powers of two in $S_m$ . Furthermore $f_m(2m + 1)$ must be a power of two, as it is the sum of exactly half of a row of pascal's triangle. As the row is symmetrical, the sum of both halves are the same. For a hand-wavey proof, let $x$ be the sum of half the row. The sum of the full row is then $2x$ . Since the sum of the full row is also a power of two, $2x = 2^n$ for some $n$ . Therefore $x = 2^{n-1}$ , a power of two.

Each of these intervals has length,  1/n, and since $\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} 1/n =\infty$ and the length of the interval (0,1) is 1, there must be a point l in (0,1) which is covered by infinite intervals, say $(a_{n_k}-\frac{1}{2n_k},a_{n_k}+\frac{1}{2{n_k}} )$ , therefore $$\lim a_{n_k}=l\in(0,1)$$ The author says the proof is wrong because one can not always pick a finite subcover from an infinite cover (hence because the interval $(0,1)$ it's not compact), but I claim the proof breaks down even before that. Why? Because there isn't always a point in $(0,1)$ which is covered by infinite intervals, and an example of a collection of intervals for which there isn't a point $l$ in $(0,1)$ which is covered by infinite intervals is obtained when we substitute $a_n$ for $\frac{1}{2n}$, that is, the collection $\{(0,1/n), n\in \mathbb{N}\}$.

61,Divisibility of an Evenly Spaced Binomial Coefficient Series,Divisibility of an Evenly Spaced Binomial Coefficient Series,,"By this paper , it can be shown that for $n>0$ and $N\in\mathbb{N}$ $$\sum_{k=0}^n\binom{Nn}{Nk}=\frac{2^{Nn}}{N}\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}(-1)^{kn}\cos^{Nn}\left(\frac{k\pi}{N}\right)$$ Now, for a recursive sequence defined here, $$A_n(N)=-\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\binom{Nn}{Nk}A_k(N); A_0(N)=1$$ and so $$A_n(N)+1=-\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\binom{Nn}{Nk}A_k(N)$$ From here it can be easily obtained that $A_1(N)=-1$.  Now I originally wanted to show that for certain values, we have that $$A_n(N)+1\equiv 0\pmod{N+1}$$ But this seems to be only true for certain values of $N$, where $N=2,3,4,6$.  I determined this by an induction argument, whose base case is above.  For all $0<k<m$, we assume $A_m(N)+1\equiv 0\pmod{N+1}$.  This means that $A_m(N)\equiv N\equiv -1\pmod{N+1}$ and thus $A_m(N)=(N+1)q-1$ for $q\in\mathbb{Z}$.  Substituting into the above recursion yields $$A_m(N)+1=-\sum_{k=1}^{m-1}\binom{Nm}{Nk}[(N+1)q-1]=-(N+1)\sum_{k=1}^{m-1}\binom{Nm}{Nk}q+\sum_{k=1}^{m-1}\binom{Nm}{Nk}$$ The first RHS sum is necessarily divisible by $N+1$, so the second sum in question would have to be divisible by $N+1$.  However this is not always the case.  To see its divisibility by $2,3,4$ and $6$, note that \begin{eqnarray*}\sum_{k=1}^{m-1}\binom{Nm}{Nk}&=&\sum_{k=0}^{m}\binom{Nm}{Nk}-\binom{Nm}{0}-\binom{Nm}{Nm}\\&=&\frac{2^{Nm}}{N}\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}(-1)^{km}\cos^{Nm}\left(\frac{k\pi}{N}\right)-2\end{eqnarray*} And from this form, we can show the validity of divisibilities for $N=2,3,4,6$ by cases (replacing $N$ and working out the residue under modulus $(N+1)$) My question is this.  I KNOW that it is not true for all $N$ through a proof presented here .  Is there a way to either 1)  Find more values of $N$ where it holds 2)  if not, prove that for the remaining values of $N$, the hypothesis is wrong? The values of $N$ chosen $(2,3,4,6)$ are based due to the fact the formula above involves cosines and take on simple values to calculate algebraically.  I don't know how to show that it is invalid for the remaining or how to find other values of $N$.  Can anyone help guide the way? EDIT: So I used Mathematica to do a calculation of the divisibility up to $N=50$.    Using the binomial sum instead of the cosine sum, I was able to see that for the first 50 numbers of each recursion for $N$, the values of $N$ that seem to produce the divisibility results are those numbers that are prime powers minus 1, $p^\alpha$, for prime $p$ and positive integer $\alpha$.

This is the generalized hypergeometric function $_4 F_4(1, 1, 1, 1; 2, 2, 2, 2; x)$ by definition.

For every $n$ let $z_n$ be the integer closest to the number $\alpha n$. Then we can define $$A(\alpha):= \sum_{n=1}^\infty |\alpha n - z_n|.$$ We can also define somewhat similar quantity $$B(\alpha):= \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(\alpha n - \lfloor \alpha n \rfloor \right).$$ $A(\alpha)$ and $B(\alpha)$ are sums of non-negative numbers, so the values can be real numbers of $+\infty$. EDIT: In fact, the above sums are clearly both equal to $+\infty$, since $n \alpha$ will be infinitely often arbitrarily close to and integer (and also to a number of the form $k+\frac12$, $k\in\mathbb Z$). See, for example, Multiples of an irrational number forming a dense subset (and several other posts on MSE). I have missed this obvious fact when posting the question. However the sums $A'(\alpha)$ and $B'(\alpha)$ described below might still be interesting. I left here the part about $A(\alpha)$ and $B(\alpha)$, since some users already posted some comments about these sums. If I edited the first part of the post away, those comments would not make sense. We can also make modifications where we replace the sequence with monotone sequences: $$ \begin{align*} A'(\alpha):=& \sum_{n=1}^\infty \min_{k\le n}|\alpha k - z_k|;\\ B'(\alpha):=& \sum_{n=1}^\infty \min_{k\le n} \left(\alpha k - \lfloor \alpha k \rfloor\right).\\ \end{align*} $$ In some sense, these quantities tell us how far $\alpha$ is from rational numbers. (The monotone versions seem more closely related to question whether $\alpha$ is rational or irrational, since for rational $\alpha$ all but finitely many terms are zero, so the sum must be finite.) My question is: Were the numbers $A'(\alpha)$, $B'(\alpha)$ studied somewhere? Can they be calculated for some specific irrational numbers? For example, can we calculate them for $\alpha=\ln 2$, $\alpha=\sqrt2$, $\alpha=e$, $\alpha=\pi$ or some other well-know irrational numbers? Do we get $A'(\alpha)=\infty$ or $B'(\alpha)=\infty$ for some numbers? If yes, can such numbers be characterized? Are they related to irrationality measure or some other ways to measure how irrational a given number $\alpha$ is? To explain what lead me to these sums: I was thinking about question whether there is a counterexample to Minkowski's theorem for unbounded sets. (Such question was asked here . In the meantime I learned here that such example cannot be found.) So I was trying to take a line $y=\alpha x$ which does not contain any lattice points. I tried to replace the segments of this line by wider rectangles - this lead me to try to compute how wide rectangles I can add without hitting some lattice point.

82,Interesting sequence involving prime numbers jumping on the number line.,Interesting sequence involving prime numbers jumping on the number line.,,"Udpate 4: Trying to characterize finite and infinite cycles. Update 3: All primes $a_0\ge29$ seem to either have infinite cycles or finite non-terminating cycles that converge to infinite cycles of other primes. More examples added at the end of the post (visualized as graphs). Also, renamed the post. Update 2: I've found it can be shown that $29$ and $31$ will never terminate. I believe the same can be done for all other primes. Explanation is added at the end of the post. Update 1: Turns out my initial question is a degenerate case of a broader observation. The broader observation (""Conjecture"") is added at the bottom of the post. Defining the sequence Pick any starting number $a_0\in\mathbb N$ on the number line. At $n$ th step (starting at step $n=1$ on your starting number): jump $a_0+n$ numbers to the right (add $a_0+n$) if current number is not composite jump $a_0+n$ numbers to the left (subtract $a_0+n$) if current number is composite If $a_0\lt0$, then reverse the condition (subtract for not composite and add for composite). If $a_0=0$, you stop jumping. By ""not composite"", it is meant ""prime or one"" (zero is stopping condition). For example, If we start with $a_0=6$, we have $(6)-7\rightarrow(-1)-8\rightarrow(-9)+9\rightarrow0$. This process can be defined as: Pick a starting number $a_0\in\mathbb N$ and define a sequence: $a_{n+1}=$ $$ \begin{cases} a_{n}+(a_0+n+1),  & \text{if $a_n>0$ and $a_n$  is not composite or $a_n<0$ and $|a_n|$ is composite} \\ a_{n}-(a_0+n+1), &  \text{if $a_n<0$ and $|a_n|$ is not composite or $a_n>0$ and $a_n$ is composite} \\ 0, & \text{if $a_n=0$} \end{cases} $$ ""Not composite"" in the above definition means that it ""is prime or is $1$"". ""Composite"" is then ""not prime and not one"", while zero ends the sequence. If there exists $k\in\mathbb N$ such that $a_k=0$, then we say the   sequence terminates (converges to $0$). Examining the sequence It is easy to show that if $a_0$ is composite, the sequence always terminates: (One can write down the sequence for even $a_0$ and for odd $a_0$ to conclude:) $a_3=0$ if $a_0$ is odd and composite, or $a_0$ is even and $a_0+3$ is composite $a_{11}=0$ if $a_0$ is even and $a_0+3$ is not composite and $a_0+11$ is composite $a_{19}=0$ if $a_0$ is even and $a_0+3$ is not composite and $a_0+11$ is not composite But when $a_0$ is prime or equal to $1$ (not composite), I have (computed): $a_0=1 \rightarrow a_{14}=0, \space(1, 3, 6, 2, 7, 13, 20, 12, 3, 13, 24, 12, -1, -15, 0)$ $a_0=2 \rightarrow a_{8}=0, \space(2, 5, 9, 4, -2, -9, -1, -10, 0) $ $a_0=3 \rightarrow a_{6}=0, \space(3, 7, 12, 6, -1, -9, 0) $ $a_0=5 \rightarrow a_{22}=0, \space(5, 11, 18, 10, 1, 11, 22, 10, -3, -17, -32, -16, 1, 19, 38,\dots, 0) $ $a_0=7 \rightarrow a_{14}=0, \space(7, 15, 6, -4, 7, 19, 32, 18, 3, 19, 36, 18, -1, -21, 0) $ $a_0=11 \rightarrow a_{14}=0, \space(11, 23, 36, 22, 7, 23, 40, 22, 3, 23, 44, 22, -1, -25, 0) $ $a_0=13 \rightarrow a_{42}=0, \space(13, 27, 12, -4, 13, 31, 50, 30, 9, -13, -36, -12, 13, 39, 12,\dots, 0) $ $a_0=17 \rightarrow a_{38}=0, \space(17, 35, 16, -4, 17, 39, 16, -8, 17, 43, 70, 42, 13, 43, 74, 42, 9, \dots, 0) $ $a_0=19 \rightarrow a_{110}=0, \space(19, 39, 18, -4, 19, 43, 68, 42, 15, -13, -42, -12, 19, 51, 18,\dots, 0) $ $a_0=23 \rightarrow a_{106}=0, \space(23, 47, 72, 46, 19, 47, 76, 46, 15, -17, -50, -16, 19, 55, 18, \dots,0) $ Prime numbers $\ge29$ seem to never reach $0$. Are these truly the only primes that reach zero? Can we show that no other prime will reach zero? Update 1: After letting the sequence continue after numbers hit $0$, and observing sequences: (If $0$ in the above definition is treated as composite and does not terminate the sequence:) Conjecture: If we observe $a_0=a\ne23$, then: If $(a\gt19)$ is not prime , and $(a+4k)$ is prime number for some $k\in\mathbb N$, then the sequence starting with $a_0=a$  will hit $0$ exactly $k$ times for terms $a_3,a_7,a_{11},\dots,a_{4k-1}$, and no other terms. The case $k=0$ is a degenerate case of the previous claim and is: If $(a\gt19)$ is prime , we never hit $0$. It is easily shown that the above holds for $k\ne0$ (all cases of $k$ but the degenerate one) as odd composite numbers will reach zero at $a_3$ after which we have a new odd number, and the same thing will repeat unless we have a prime number; which causes the sequence to enter a cycle which seems to contains no further zeroes (entering the $k=0$ case). Trivial observation for cases not included above: If $(1\le a\le19)$ or $(a\gt2$ and is even $)$, $a_0=a$ will hit zero infinitely many times. This is true (can be easily shown) for even numbers since we know that even numbers $\gt2$ will reach zeroes at one of $a_3,a_{11},a_{19}$ terms for the first time, after which we are left with a new even number, which repeats the cycle indefinitely. It is true as well for first $19$ numbers and number $23$ since they are computed to continue at an even number after reaching their first zero, which enters the infinite cycle of the even numbers. It still remains to show that prime numbers $\ge29$ themselves will not reach zero, as those primes seem to enter cycles that do not contain zeroes. I suspect one should be able to show cycles that do not contain  zero for odd prime numbers, similar to the cycle for even numbers which revisits the zero infinitely many times. Update 2: I've observed that consecutive prime numbers reach same values infinitely many times. For example, primes $29,31$ will reach numbers ${25,26,27,28,29,30,31}$ infinitely many times as some $a_k$ members of their sequences. Turns out it can be shown that $29$ and $31$ will never reach $0$. This can be done by observing $a_k=29$ and assuming $k$ is even. By looking at all cases while writing out the sequence, eventually a full cycle will be shown and we can use induction. (Also for example; If you assume $59+k$ is prime and follow the blue arrow as shown below, that implies $k$ is even in the following nodes.) A simplified proof can be shown as a graph that generates the sequences for $29$ and $31$: Red arrows imply the previous node is composite, and blue arrows imply it is prime. Note that constants summed with $k$ in nodes are based on the starting position $a_k=29$ and assuming shorter paths back to $29$; taking longer paths results in larger summing constants in some nodes (meaning nodes being visited repeatedly or in different order following the longer paths before reaching $29$ and substituting $a_{k+l}=29$ with $a_k=29$ again); but the graph remains the same nonetheless. The nonconstant nodes clearly grow in absolute value for $k\ge0$ and $\ne0$. I believe we can construct a generating graph for all sequences starting with primes and show that the ones where $a_0\ge29$ will never reach $0$. Is it possible to prove this for all primes, rather than confirming it one by one for individual (finitely many) cases? Update 3: It seems that every starting prime number $a_0\ge29$ will either revisit itself infinitely many times (infinite cycle) for some $a_k$ terms, or revisit itself finitely  many times (finite cycle), and after that its sequence will converge to a sequence of some other prime; which again either has an finite or infinite cycle. We can revisit the $(29,31)$ example from above, where we have that the sequences of these two primes are the same infinite cycle. We can draw the same graph from above in a circular form: Nodes represent some terms $a_k$ of their sequences, and following the arrows you get the next term $a_{k+1}$. Nonconstant nodes have decimal names which were generated while drawing the graph. Constant nodes have their exact values; these are ${25,26,27,28,29,30,31}$ for this particular example, as already mentioned above. Nonconstant nodes $a_k$ are either always composite, or take both composite and prime values for different $k$; which is shown by having either one or two different paths leaving them. We can also look at an example involving finite cycles. Prime number $157$ has a finite cycle and its sequence converges to the prime number $163$. (Last time it is revisited is for $a_{116}=157$, and in total it is visited $23$ times) Prime numbers $(163,167)$ share the same finite cycle, and it converges to the prime number $173$. (Last time $a_0=163$ is revisited is for $a_{152}=163$, and in total it is visited $27$ times; Last time $a_0=167$ is revisited is for $a_{12}=167$, and in total it is visited $4$ times) Prime number $173$ has a finite cycle and its sequence converges to the prime number $179$. (Only time it is visited is for $a_{0}=173$, in total that's only once) Prime numbers $(179,181)$ share the same infinite cycle which can be displayed: We can also visualize the previous finite cycles of primes which eventually converge to the above cycle (redrawn again as the rightmost cycle): $157\rightarrow (163,167)\rightarrow173\rightarrow (179,181).$ Click the image to see it in full size. Another example; primes $(37,41,43)$ all share the same infinite cycle, and prime $47$ has a minimal finite cycle which converges to theirs: There is also an example such as: $359\rightarrow367\rightarrow373\rightarrow(379,383)\rightarrow389\rightarrow(397,401)\rightarrow(419,421)\leftarrow409$ Where we have two different sequences of finite cycles converging to the same infinite cycle. The longer sequence of cycles from this example can be seen below: It seems that primes sharing cycles and primes that are a part of connected cycles, are consecutive primes. All primes $359, 367, 373, 379, 383, 389, 397, 401, 409, 419, 421$ from the last example are consecutive. Seems like we could represent all sequences for all primes as one   single graph, where consecutive primes build connected components of   the graph. All primes $a_0\ge29$ seem to only revisit constant nodes $a_k$ that are $a_0\approx a_k$ their size. All other nonconstant nodes diverge to either $\pm\infty$, for $k\to\infty$. No $0$ nodes have been found so far, which would defy the $a_0\approx a_k$ observation, for constant $a_k$ ( by ""constant term of the sequence"" I mean ""recurring term of the sequence""; $a_k=a$ for different $k$ ). One can generate graphs for individual primes and prove this and the initial question (for finitely many terms); that primes $\ge29$ do not terminate (reach $0$). But I still do not know how can one prove this for all primes, rather than checking individual cases. If we look at sequences of primes, every prime eventually converges to some other prime. If we observe only the first next prime they visit, we can represent the convergence relations with a graph and build the forest of primes. For primes up to $10009$ we have: (Open the image in a new tab and zoom in) Update 4: Characterization of cycles I've noticed that the following seems to hold for prime $a_0$: If $a_0\ge29$ is a Sophie Germain Prime ($2a_0+1$ is prime), then: $a_0$ will have infinite cycle $\iff$ $a_0+2$ is prime $a_0$ will have a finite cycle that does not revisit $a_0$ $\iff$   $a_0+2$ is not prime If $a_0\ge29$ is not a Sophie Germain Prime, then then $a_0$ will be revisited at least $2$ times. If $a_0\ge29$ is 1st term in Twin Prime pair ($a_0+2$ is prime), then: $a_0$ will have an infinite cycle $\iff$ $a_0$ is not a 3rd term of a   prime quadruple . $a_0$ will have an finite cycle $\iff$ $a_0$ is a 3rd term of a   prime quadruple . If we have a Prime Triplet starting with $a_0\ge29$, then: $a_0$ will have infinite cycle $\iff$ $a_0$ is not Median term of   prime quintuplets . $a_0$ will have finite cycle $\iff$ $a_0$ is Median term of prime   quintuplets . If we have tuples of $\ge4$ consecutive primes; that is: If $a_0\ge29$ is 1st term of a Prime Quadruplet or a longer Prime Constellation , then that seems to imply that $a_0$ will have an infinite cycle. Can we characterize the finite/infinite cycles more precisely; or find counterexamples to these claims?","Udpate 4: Trying to characterize finite and infinite cycles.

For primes up to $10009$ we have: (Open the image in a new tab and zoom in) Update 4: Characterization of cycles I've noticed that the following seems to hold for prime $a_0$: If $a_0\ge29$ is a Sophie Germain Prime ($2a_0+1$ is prime), then: $a_0$ will have infinite cycle $\iff$ $a_0+2$ is prime $a_0$ will have a finite cycle that does not revisit $a_0$ $\iff$   $a_0+2$ is not prime If $a_0\ge29$ is not a Sophie Germain Prime, then then $a_0$ will be revisited at least $2$ times. If $a_0\ge29$ is 1st term in Twin Prime pair ($a_0+2$ is prime), then: $a_0$ will have an infinite cycle $\iff$ $a_0$ is not a 3rd term of a   prime quadruple . $a_0$ will have an finite cycle $\iff$ $a_0$ is a 3rd term of a   prime quadruple . If we have a Prime Triplet starting with $a_0\ge29$, then: $a_0$ will have infinite cycle $\iff$ $a_0$ is not Median term of   prime quintuplets . $a_0$ will have finite cycle $\iff$ $a_0$ is Median term of prime   quintuplets . If we have tuples of $\ge4$ consecutive primes; that is: If $a_0\ge29$ is 1st term of a Prime Quadruplet or a longer Prime Constellation , then that seems to imply that $a_0$ will have an infinite cycle. Can we characterize the finite/infinite cycles more precisely; or find counterexamples to these claims?",,"['sequences-and-series', 'graph-theory', 'prime-numbers']"

I am open about this being a given problem, however it is not homework. The problem is stated as follows. Assume we have an infinite tetration as follows $$x^{x^{x^{.^{.^.}}}} \, = \, a$$ With a given $a$ find $x$ . The next part of the problem was to discuss the convergence radius of a. If a is too big or too small the tetration does not converge. Below is my humble stab at the problem. My friend said you would have to treat the tetration as a infinite series, and therefore could not perform algebraic manipulations on it before it is know whether it converges or diverges. However my attempt is to first do some algebraic steps, then discuss the convergence radius. I) Initial discussion At the start it is obvious that the tetration converges when $a=1$ (just set $x=1$ ) Now after some computer hardwork it seems that the tetration fails to converge when a is roughly larger than 3. II) Algebraic manipulation $$ x^{x^{x^{.^{.^.}}}} \, = \, a$$ This is the same as $$ x^a \, = \, a$$ $$ \log_a(x^a) \, = \, \log_a(a)$$ $$ \log_a(x) \, = \, \frac{1}{a}$$ $$ x \, = \, a^{\frac{1}{a}}$$ Now, if we let $a=2$ then $x = \sqrt{2}$ . After some more computational work, this seems to be correct, which makes me believe this formula is correct. III) Discsussion about convergence By looking at the derivative of $ \displaystyle \large a^{\frac{1}{a}} $ we see that the maxima occurs when $a=e$ , which also seems to correspond to the inital computational work. Now I think, that the minima of $\displaystyle \large a^{1/a}$ is zero by looking at its graph, studying its derivative and the endpoints. So that my ""guess"" or work shows that it converges when $$ a \in [0 \, , \,  1/e] $$ VI) My questions Can my algebraic manipulations be justified?
