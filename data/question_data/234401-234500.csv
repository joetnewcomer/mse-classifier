0,Is the intersection of a set of cardinals contained in the set?,Is the intersection of a set of cardinals contained in the set?,,"Given a set $\mathcal{C}$ of Cardinals, does $$D:=\bigcap_{C\in\mathcal{C}} C \in \mathcal{C}$$ hold? If $\mathcal{C}$ is finite or contains a finite cardinal, the answer is positive even for ordinals instead of cardinals because of elementary ordinal properties. The infinite case however does not seem so obvious. Assuming the contrary, one could construct an infinite sequence of proper descreasing cardinals $C_0 \supsetneq C_1 \supsetneq C_2 \supsetneq \ldots \supsetneq D$ with all $C_k\in\mathcal{C}$. Intuitively I don't believe that's possible, not even for ordinals. I tried applying Zorn's lemma using $\supseteq$ for $\leq$ to give $D$ a proper structure, but using D as an upper limit with respect to this relation doesn't seem to work because the lemma seems to require $D\in\mathcal{C}$ to work, which is what I want to show. So that's a dead end for me. I'm hardly used to ordinals and cardinals and grateful for help. Background: I'm trying to do some formalization of (Multi)Graph theory in Mizar and given graphs with arbitrary vertex degree, I was wondering if it makes sense do differ between the concept of the infinum of all vertex degrees (i.e. their intersection) and the minimum (if present, smallest vertex degree).","Given a set $\mathcal{C}$ of Cardinals, does $$D:=\bigcap_{C\in\mathcal{C}} C \in \mathcal{C}$$ hold?

Besides the things they told us in school, I also reassured myself with these: Is every real number the supremum of a set of rational numbers? and Is there a rational number between any two irrationals? . Though the latter probably does not add anything to my confusion. I found proofs that there are rational numbers between any two irrational numbers. And also every irrational number $\iota$ can be represented as a supremum of a subset of Rationals $S=\{ x \in  \mathbb Q  | x< \iota \}$. And that is the problem for me, because irrational numbers with ordering $\leq$ form a linear ordering. Therefore the map $f:\mathbb I \text{(irrationals)}\to 2^{\mathbb Q}$ given by already mentioned rule should implicate that $\iota_1<\iota_2 \iff f(\iota_1)\subset f(\iota_2)$. They cannot have same elements and there must be inclusion in way or another, because I take all the rational numbers smaller than some upper bound. This is the part that I think is probably not correct, but I do not see why at this moment.

And that is the problem for me, because irrational numbers with ordering $\leq$ form a linear ordering. Therefore the map $f:\mathbb I \text{(irrationals)}\to 2^{\mathbb Q}$ given by already mentioned rule should implicate that $\iota_1<\iota_2 \iff f(\iota_1)\subset f(\iota_2)$. They cannot have same elements and there must be inclusion in way or another, because I take all the rational numbers smaller than some upper bound. This is the part that I think is probably not correct, but I do not see why at this moment. However that would mean there is a set of subsets of $\mathbb Q$ of uncountable size forming a linear ordering, which is impossible, because that would require an uncountable set to begin with, right? Where is(are) the mistake(s) in reasoning and why? And also, which is probably obvious, I do not know much about the construction of the suprema, so there might be another key information explaining this seemingly contradictory conclusions.",,"['elementary-set-theory', 'real-numbers', 'irrational-numbers']"

R is also ant-symmetric, so for every pair $xRy$, we will have $yRx$ because of the union, and so $R\cup R^{-1}$ is symmetric. Now I tried thinking on transitive, I took an example: $R={(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(1,2),(2,3),)(1,3)}$ If you do $R\cup R^{-1}$ you get a transitive relation. I can't find an example to break it. What am I doing wrong ? For (b) I tried a similar example and go $R^{2}=R$ which shows it's true, but it must have been a private case. How can you explain the fact that (b) is true ? (I am not looking for a formal proof). For (c), if I use intersection, I get only ""reflexive"" couples, so this is true. Am I correct on this one at least ?

Source of wonder.image","Recently in my class I have encountered the question as to whether the following statement is considered correct: Define $\Omega = \{ 0,1 \}^\mathbb{N} $, are subsets of  $\{0,1\}^n$ for $ n = 1,2,3,...$ also subsets of $\Omega$? It seems strange if the answer is yes because if I consider $\{0,1\}^2$ = $\{(0,0), (0,1), (1,0),(1,1)\}$, and $\{0,1\}^1$= $\{(0),(1)\}$ then intuitively it feels very strange to compare $\{(0)\}$ with $\{(0,1)\}$ or $\{(1,0)\}$ because they seem to have different 'dimensions', if the use of such term is even appropriate here. However the question I have been given seems to suggest that the above is correct. Could somebody enlighten me on this question? Thanks! Furthermore, if the above holds true, would elements in the sigma algebra of, say $\{(0,1)^1\}$ be elements in the sigma algebra of $\{(0,1)^2\}$ as well? Thanks! Edit: Subject to the response that I have just received to the above question to be 'no'. Would it appear that my assignment question is making a contradiction? Is it perhaps defining this fact simply for purpose of this question? Source of wonder.image",,"['probability', 'measure-theory', 'elementary-set-theory']"
