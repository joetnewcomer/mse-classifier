25,Number of Shortest Paths Between Two Points on a Chess Board,Number of Shortest Paths Between Two Points on a Chess Board,,"I'm struggling to come up with an equation that can determine the number of shortest paths for a King between two points on a chess board. I came across Getting the shortest paths for chess pieces on n*m board , which uses a BFS to find the answer. However, I don't really need to know the path and I was hoping to come up with a general equation. I also noticed this was similar to some questions asked about finding Lattice Paths, however in this case, the path may contain horizontal movement. I started with a small case, with the starting point of A4 and a target point of C4. It's quick to see there are only three shortest paths between the two points (A4-B5-C4, A4-B4-C4, and A4-B3-C4).

At this point it seemed like coming up with an equation wouldn't too terribly hard, but my math skills fail me here.

Basically, I've got a problem like this: I precomputed C(38,6) values ( i.e . 2 760 681 values)  that are now store in a big lookup table.  Memory ain't an issue.  Precomputing ain't an issue.

Also, C(38,6) is just an example, I could be needing C(42,7) as well, etc. When I did the precomputing, I basically looped like this (the actual code is more complicated for the load needed to be spread across several machines and for the actual computation aren't here but here's the meat of it): for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {     for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {         for (int k = j + 1; k < n; k++) {             for (int l = k + 1; l < n; l++) {                 for (int m = l + 1; m < n; m++) {                     for (int o = m + 1; o < n; o++) {                        ...                         }                 }             }         }     } } The only thing that matters is to have the fastest lookup time possible.

Is there a closed formula for this that is fast to compute? What I've got now is a binary search: my i shall always be lower than j , j lower than k etc.  I then created an arbitrary index doing: (i + 1) * (n exp 5) + (j + 1) * (n exp 4) + (k + 1) * (n exp 3) + (l + 1) * (n exp 2) + (m + 1) * n + o This is probably overkill but guarantees no collisions. I then do a binary search on that index and find where the precomputed value is stored. This is kinda fast but I was wondering if there was a faster way to ""reach"" my precomputed index? Basically because I don't know enumerative combinatorics well enough I'm precomputing my own index and using that index to do a binary search.  This is fast but I'm looking for something faster, like a closed formula (I doubt anything doing ""enumerations"" and i++ or things like that would be faster than those few multiplication to compute that index + the binary search).

Basically, I've got a problem like this: I precomputed C(38,6) values ( i.e . 2 760 681 values)  that are now store in a big lookup table.  Memory ain't an issue.  Precomputing ain't an issue.  The ""order"" ain't an issue and I can re-order in any way I like. Also, C(38,6) is just an example, I could be needing C(42,7) as well, etc. When I did the precomputing, I basically looped like this (the actual code is more complicated for the load needed to be spread across several machines and for the actual computation aren't here but here's the meat of it): for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {     for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {         for (int k = j + 1; k < n; k++) {             for (int l = k + 1; l < n; l++) {                 for (int m = l + 1; m < n; m++) {                     for (int o = m + 1; o < n; o++) {                        ...                         }                 }             }         }     } } The only thing that matters is to have the fastest lookup time possible. I've got i,j,k,l,m and n all in [0..37] (or [1..38], doesn't matter) and I need to access the corresponding precomputed element in my huge lookup array as fast as possible. Is there a closed formula for this that is fast to compute? What I've got now is a binary search: my i shall always be lower than j , j lower than k etc.  I then created an arbitrary index doing: (i + 1) * (n exp 5) + (j + 1) * (n exp 4) + (k + 1) * (n exp 3) + (l + 1) * (n exp 2) + (m + 1) * n + o This is probably overkill but guarantees no collisions. I then do a binary search on that index and find where the precomputed value is stored. This is kinda fast but I was wondering if there was a faster way to ""reach"" my precomputed index? Basically because I don't know enumerative combinatorics well enough I'm precomputing my own index and using that index to do a binary search.  This is fast but I'm looking for something faster, like a closed formula (I doubt anything doing ""enumerations"" and i++ or things like that would be faster than those few multiplication to compute that index + the binary search). I think the complexity of my method is log(n) but I'm just not sure.",,['combinatorics']

Then, there must be a section of MMM (an M is a male), MMMM, or MMMMM. Now, let's count with PIE. There are $10$ places to put the MMM in a string of 12 letters, and for the remaining men and women, there are $\binom{9}{2}$ ways to arrange them. So, we have $10 \cdot \binom{9}{2}$ . However, this overcounts MMMM twice, so we subtract each MMMM once. There are $9$ places to put an  MMMM and $\binom{8}{1}$ ways to place the remaining men and women, so we have $10 \cdot \binom{9}{2} - 9 \cdot \binom{8}{1} = 360 - 72 = 288$ .

If relevant, some decades ago I survived but have forgotten much of: ""Real Analysis : Volume 1 : 2nd Ed."" (Apostol, 1966). The first of ""Elementary Number Theory"" (Uspensky and Heaslett, 1938) [through quadratic reciprocity]. In my experience, there are three typical approaches to this type of problem: The Direct Approach Recursion Inclusion-Exclusion This particular problem interested me, because of the challenge involved in providing three distinct solutions, one for each of the above approaches.  However, exploring Inclusion-Exclusion , I concluded that the math involved was too ugly to be reasonably feasible. However, I was able to find two distinct Direct Approaches to offer. See my self - answers. For clarity, I have provided a separate answer for : A Direct Approach An Alternate Direct Approach Recursion Addendum Given the answers provided by others, it seems to me that the one pending challenge is to find some elegant solution that is based primarily on Inclusion-Exclusion. I would be very interested if someone could present such a solution. Edit Mike Earnest added an Inclusion-Exclusion response to his answer. Addendum-2 Finally conquered my own private Inclusion-Exclusion challenge for this problem.  Just added a separate Inclusion-Exclusion answer.","\underline{\textbf{Overview}} \underline{\textbf{Clarification}} N = \{1,2,\cdots, 20\} N 5 3 (k), (k+1), (k+2). \{1, 2, 4, 5, 7\} \{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\} \{1, 2, 3, 14, 18\} \{2, 3, 4, 5, 17\} \{8, 9, 10, 11, 12\} \underline{\textbf{My Background}} 50 (2/3) \underline{\textbf{Problem Relevance}} \underline{\textbf{My Work}}","['combinatorics', 'recurrence-relations', 'inclusion-exclusion', 'combinatorics-on-words']"

Thus, the interesting part of the problem is the ""only if"" one.   Proof via Dirichlet's simultaneous rational approximation theorem   Without loss of generality, we may assume that both sides of our   rectange are greater than $1$ . We can choose a positive integer $q$ such that the product of every coordinate of every vertex of every   square in our partition becomes almost an integer after multiplication   by $q$ . So, we may assume that all these coordinates differ from   integers by, at most, $\frac 15$ . Now let $a$ and $b$ be the   horizontal and the vertical side of our rectangle, respectively, and   let $s_i$ be the sides of the squares in the partition. Denote by $\tilde x$ the nearest integer to $x$ . Now, draw the horizontal lines   at all half-integer heights (i.e., the heights $\pm\frac 1 2,\pm\frac  3 2,\dots$ ) and look at the total length $L$ of these lines within our   rectangle. On one hand, we have $L=a\tilde b$ . (There are $\tilde b$ lines intersecting our rectangle and each of them intersects it by an   interval of length $a$ .) On the other hand, looking at what happens in   each square, we get $L=\sum_i s_i\tilde s_i$ . Thus $a\tilde b=\sum_is_i\tilde s_i$ . Similarly, drawing the vertical lines through   half-integer points, we arrive at the identity $b\tilde a =\sum_i  s_i\tilde s_i$ . Thus $a\tilde b=b\tilde a$ , i.e., $\frac a b=\frac  {\tilde a}{\tilde b}\in\mathbb Q$ .
