Here it is: Let $ABCDEFG$ be a regular heptagon. Now extend rays $GA$ and $CB$ to met at a point $H.$ It seems that the sum of the areas of $FED, GCBA, ABH$ are equal to $FDCG.$ Is this true? There doesn't seem much to do aside from directly computing the areas. If you put the heptagon on the coordinate plane with $E=(1,0), F=(\cos(\frac{2\pi}{7}), \sin(\frac{2\pi}{7})),$ and so on, some computation leads to the area of $FDCG$ is $8\sin(\frac{\pi}{14})\cos^3(\frac{\pi}{14})\cos(\frac{\pi}{7}).$ The area of $FED$ is $(\sin(\frac{3\pi}{14})-1)(-\cos(\frac{3\pi}{14}))$ , the area of $GCBA$ is $(\cos(\frac{\pi}{7})-\sin(\frac{\pi}{14}))(\sin(\frac{\pi}{7})+\cos(\frac{\pi}{14}))$ , The area of $ABH$ is $\sin(\frac{\pi}{7})(1+2\sin(\frac{\pi}{14})-\cos(\frac{\pi}{7})).$ It seems really messy to check that the sum of the latter three values is equal to the former, how should I approach doing this?","I was experimenting with regular polygons and I've found an interesting property with the regular heptagon in particular.

Thx in advance!","I am trying to prove: A convex polyhedron has positive Gauß-Curvature at every vertex. What we know: Gauß-Curvature at every vertex is given by $K(p) = 2\pi - \sum\limits_{\text{angle } \alpha_i \text{ around } p} \alpha_i$. Gauß-Bonnet state $\sum\limits_{\text{every vertex }p} K(p) = 2\pi\chi(S)$, where $S$ the convex polyhedron. Therefore we can also write$\sum\limits_{\text{every vertex }p} K(p) = 4\pi$. My attempt: I plugged the Gauß-Curvature in the Gauß-Bonnet-Formula and obtained $$  \sum\limits_{\text{every vertex }p} K(p) = \sum\limits_{\text{every vertex }p} \left(2\pi - \sum\limits_{\text{angle } \alpha_i \text{ around } p} \alpha_i\right) = 4\pi. $$ Assume now that there exists a $\tilde{p}$ such that $2\pi - \sum\limits_{\tilde{p}} \alpha_i < 0$.

Whenever a large rectangle is tiled by rectangles, each of which has at least one integer side - the large rectangle has at least one integer side, too.

It follows that one of these is an integer. To prove the claim, scale the entire tiling up by a factor of $p$ in each direction, and consider the tiling obtained by replacing all tile-corners $(x, y)$ in the scaled-up tiling by $([x], [y])$. This yields an integer-sided  rectangle tiled by integer-sided rectangles, each of which has one side a multiple of $p$. Therefore, the area of the large integer-sided rectangle is a multiple of $p$, whence one of its sides must be a multiple of $p$.

52,What is the real meaning of Hilbert's axiom of completeness,What is the real meaning of Hilbert's axiom of completeness,,"According to Greenberg's book of geometry it is sufficient to consider the axiom of Dedekind along with Hilbert's axioms (except of course for the Archimedian Principle and his Axiom of Completeness) in order for Euclidian Geometry to be categorical (in this case the only model is that of order pairs of numbers used in Analytic Geometry). From this I can say that, because Dedekind's axiom of continuity is equivalent to Cantor's axiom (Nested Intervals Principle) and because any of them implies the Archimedian Principle but not the other way around then I guess Hilbert's Axiom of completeness is necessary in order to fix that ""something"" missing if the Archimedian property is assumed as an axiom instead of the others. So, my problem is basically that Hilbert's axiom of completeness is pretty weird and I cannot imagine in what sense it can be used along with Archimedes' Axiom to obtain Dedekind's Axiom. Now, this is what Hilbert says in his book: This axiom gives us nothing directly concerning the existence of limiting points, or of the idea of convergence. Nevertheless, it enables us to demonstrate Bolzano’s theorem by virtue of which, for all sets of points situated upon a straight line between two definite points of the same line, there exists necessarily a point of condensation, that is to say, a limiting point. From a theoretical point of view, the value of this axiom is that it leads indirectly to the introduction of limiting points, and, hence, renders it possible to establish a one-to-one correspondence between the points of a segment and the system of real numbers. These are the definitions I'm talking about: Hilbert's Axiom of completeness: To a system of points, straight lines, and planes, it is impossible to add other elements in such a manner that the system thus generalized shall form a new geometry obeying all of the five groups of axioms. In other words, the elements of geometry form a system which is not susceptible of extension, if we regard the five groups of axioms as valid. Dedekind's Axiom: Suppose that the set ${l}$ of all points on a line $l$ is the disjoint union $\Sigma_1\cup \Sigma_2$ of two nonempty subsets such that no point of either subset is between two points of the other.Then there exists a unique point $o$ on $l$ such that one of the subsets is equal to a ray of $l$ with vertex $o$ and the other subset is equal to the complement. Cantor's Axiom: Let $\{\overline{A_nB_n}\}_{n\in N}$ be a sequence of segments on     some straight line such that $\overline{A_{n+1}B_{n+1}}\subset \overline{A_{n}B_{n}}$ for all $n\in \mathbb{N}$.

78,an extension of an Olympiad problem,an extension of an Olympiad problem,,"I'm a high school student and I'm currently working on my math extended essay. I chose an Olympiad question which is: A piece of land of a square shape with dimensions 10m x 10m is divided into 100 square parcels with dimensions 1m x 1m. Initially, 9 of the parcels are overgrown by weed. If a parcel is surrounded by at least 2 parcels with weed from its sides after some time that parcel will be overgrown by weed. Can the whole piece of land grow into weed after some time? I already have a rough idea on how to solve the original question, but my essay involves an extension to 3D, namely like this: A space of land of a cube shape with dimensions 10m x 10m x 10m is divided into 1000 cubes with dimensions 1m x 1m x 1m. What is the minimum numbers of cubes to begin with so that the whole cube would grow into weed after some time, given that if a cube is surrounded by at least two other cubes with weed it will also be overgrown by weed? After some thinking I have a hypothesis (which I have no idea whether it's correct or not). My approach start with 2D, for it is proven in the first part (somehow) that for a n x n square to grow into weed, n parcels are needed to begin with. Simplifying to a 3 x 3 x 3 cube, that means at least 3 cubes are needed for one side to be overgrown. Let the side be (x, y, z1). Now just a random cube in layer (x, y, z3) can lead to the whole cube being overgrown. I also made an expression for this: c = n+z*, where z* means n/2 rounding backwards (for example 2.5 to 2) and c is the number of cubes needed. It's a bit messy but well. The problem is, I don't know how to prove this hypothesis mathematically. The proving methods I learned like induction, direct proof etc. doesn't really apply here, which is why I'm stuck. Could you maybe point out some directions for me so that I can do some research and try proving it? Or, if it is impossible to prove, please also inform me so that I can change my plan.

87,Polyhedra that cover the sphere more than once,Polyhedra that cover the sphere more than once,,"Spherical polyhedra can be thought of as tilings of the sphere. I am interested in the possibility of double covering or multiple covering tilings of the sphere, but I can't find much information about them and would like to know where I can learn more. (It might be that they are known by a different terminology.) A ""double covering tiling"" would mean that as you add tiles to the sphere there will be a place where they don't line up, but if you keep adding tiles on top of the existing ones and keep going, they will line up once every part of the sphere is covered by exactly two tiles. This idea can be extended to triple cover tilings and so on, assuming those exist. This idea has to be made precise in the right way - that's also part of the question. In the comments, Ivan Neretin gives an example that would make the question trivial, but it can be excluded by stipulating that the angles have to add up to $2\pi$ at each vertex, so let's add that as a requirement. (edit: or in fact let's not, since that would exclude multiple coverings entirely.) It seems that double cover tilings exist and are known. Wikipedia's page on uniform polyhedra says ""There are some non-orientable polyhedra that have double covers satisfying the definition of a uniform polyhedron,"" but doesn't give further details except to say that they aren't usually counted as uniform polyhedra. A web page on tiling the sphere with triangles states that the spherical triangle with angles 90 $^\circ$ , 75 $^\circ$ and 45 $^\circ$ will give a double covering of the sphere and that a 75 $^\circ$ -60 $^\circ$ -60 $^\circ$ triangle gives a five-fold tiling. In general I'm looking for more information about multiple covering sphere tilings, but here are my specific questions about them: Are there any/many other known examples of double coverings, aside from the 90 $^\circ$ -75 $^\circ$ -45 $^\circ$ triangle? Are there any examples of double covering tilings that are made of regular polygons and are vertex transitive, as hinted at on the Wikipedia page? I would like to see a specific example. What about triple and higher order coverings - are there known examples beside the 75 $^\circ$ -60 $^\circ$ -60 $^\circ$ triangle, and are there any composed of regular polygons? Do there exist $n$ -fold coverings for every $n$ ? Are there ""infinite covering tilings"" in the sense that you can keep adding tiles in the same repeated pattern but the edges will never quite line up, so each part of the sphere will be covered by an infinite number of tiles? If so, are there such tilings where all the tiles are regular polygons? Is there a set of tiles such that you can always add more tiles, but not in a repeating pattern? This would be a spherical analog of aperiodic tilings of the plane, such as Penrose tiles.","Spherical polyhedra can be thought of as tilings of the sphere. I am interested in the possibility of double covering or multiple covering tilings of the sphere, but I can't find much information about them and would like to know where I can learn more. (It might be that they are known by a different terminology.) A ""double covering tiling"" would mean that as you add tiles to the sphere there will be a place where they don't line up, but if you keep adding tiles on top of the existing ones and keep going, they will line up once every part of the sphere is covered by exactly two tiles. This idea can be extended to triple cover tilings and so on, assuming those exist. This idea has to be made precise in the right way - that's also part of the question. In the comments, Ivan Neretin gives an example that would make the question trivial, but it can be excluded by stipulating that the angles have to add up to at each vertex, so let's add that as a requirement. (edit: or in fact let's not, since that would exclude multiple coverings entirely.) It seems that double cover tilings exist and are known. Wikipedia's page on uniform polyhedra says ""There are some non-orientable polyhedra that have double covers satisfying the definition of a uniform polyhedron,"" but doesn't give further details except to say that they aren't usually counted as uniform polyhedra. A web page on tiling the sphere with triangles states that the spherical triangle with angles 90 , 75 and 45 will give a double covering of the sphere and that a 75 -60 -60 triangle gives a five-fold tiling. In general I'm looking for more information about multiple covering sphere tilings, but here are my specific questions about them: Are there any/many other known examples of double coverings, aside from the 90 -75 -45 triangle? Are there any examples of double covering tilings that are made of regular polygons and are vertex transitive, as hinted at on the Wikipedia page? I would like to see a specific example. What about triple and higher order coverings - are there known examples beside the 75 -60 -60 triangle, and are there any composed of regular polygons? Do there exist -fold coverings for every ?

But how do we know that the polar of the red point is independent of the 2 secants/chords chosen to draw it?
