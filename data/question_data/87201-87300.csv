Note that almost everything can be found in C. Pugh's, Real Mathematical Analysis (soft-cover, 2nd Edition, ISBN: 978-1-4419-2941-9); furthermore, although it is a book-preview, what I'm about to refer to as well as question can (hopefully, as it did for me) be found here . My question concerns the very beginning of the proof of the Stone-Weierstrass Theorem in Pugh's book (proof of Theorem 19, PG. 224 in the actual book, or PG. 235 in the book-preview link above). The theorem from the text is restated below. Stone-Weierstrass Theorem: If $M$ is a compact metric space, and $\mathcal{A}$ is a function algebra in $C^{0}M$ that vanishes nowhere and separates points, then $\mathcal{A}$ is dense in $C^{0}M$ . As far as the definitions of a function algebra, the function algebra vanishing at a point $p\in M$ , as well as the function algebra separating points in $M$ , please see the link above (they are available in the preview for me, but I omitted them for the sake of saving space - I will gladly state them if need be). Moreover, for some compact metric space $M$ , $C^{0}M$ is shorthand notation for the set $C^{0}\big(M,\mathbb{R}\big)=\big\{ \phi~|~\phi:M\rightarrow\mathbb{R},~\phi\text{ is continuous on }M\big\}$ , i.e., $C^{0}M$ is the set of continuous, real-valued functions on the compact metric space $M$ . Now for my question. In the very beginning of Pugh's proof of the theorem above, we assume $\mathcal{A}\subset C^{0}M$ is a function algebra that vanishes nowhere and separates points (clearly),  Then, we show $\mathcal{A}$ is dense in $C^{0}M$ , to which the proof asserts that this can be shown by proving for any $F\in C^{0}M$ and any $\varepsilon>0$ , there exists a $G\in\mathcal{A}$ such that for all $x\in M$ we have $F(x)-\varepsilon<G(x)<F(x)+\varepsilon$ (equivalently, $\big|G(x)-F(x)\big|=\big|F(x)-G(x)\big|<\varepsilon$ ). Now, earlier in the book -- which isn't part of the book-preview for me, unfortunately (if it helps, the definition is on PG. 98 in Pugh's text) -- Pugh defines density of a set which is restated below (I added the ambient topological space part for reference purposes). Definition: Let $M$ be a metric (or topological) space. If $S\subset M$ and $\overline{S}=M$ , then $S$ is dense in $M$ . I've been trying to connect the statement at the beginning of the Stone-Weierstrass proof with this definition above. In other words, in the proof of the Stone-Weierstrass Theorem in Pugh's text, we need to show that $\overline{\mathcal{A}}=C^{0}M$ , correct? Furthermore, how does this translate to, or how do we connect this definition with, for any $F\in C^{0}M$ and any $\varepsilon>0$ , there exists a $G\in\mathcal{A}$ such that for all $x\in M$ we have $F(x)-\varepsilon<G(x)<F(x)+\varepsilon$ ? First I started working with the fact that (where this can be shown) $\lim\mathcal{A}=\overline{\mathcal{A}}$ where $\lim\mathcal{A}$ is the limit set of the function algebra $\mathcal{A}$ (i.e., the set of limit points of $\mathcal{A}$ ). Then, I recalled the example that $\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$ being equivalent to saying that for any pair of distinct real numbers $p<r\in\mathbb{R}$ , there exists a rational number $q\in\mathbb{Q}$ such that $p<q<r$ . I'm thinking that I'm on the right track by going from the example that $\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$ ; and the connection I'm trying to make is possibly similar to showing that $\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$ is equivalent to saying that for some $q\in\mathbb{Q}$ , $p<q<r$ whenever $p<r\in\mathbb{R}$ ...just in a more abstract scene? In sum, any help with making this connection will be greatly appreciated. I apologize that this is a bit lengthy but I wanted to be precise. As a personal remark, check out the proof, as it is pretty neat - especially how he finds a functions that supersolves the expression $F(x)-\varepsilon<G(x)<F(x)+\varepsilon$ .","Yet again, I have a question that I could use some help with.

99,Computing the norm $\|f\|$ of a functional.,Computing the norm  of a functional.,\|f\|,"Define $f: \ell^2(\mathbb{N}) \to \Bbb C$ by: $$f(x) = \sum_{n \geq 1}\frac{x_n}{n^2},$$where $x = (x_n)_{n \geq 1} \in \ell^2(\mathbb{N})$. It is pretty clear that $f$ is linear. Also, since $\ell^2(\mathbb{N}) \subset \ell^\infty(\mathbb{N})$ and $\|x\|_\infty \leq \|x\|_2$, we have: $$\begin{align}|f(x)| &= \left|\sum_{n \geq 1}\frac{x_n}{n^2}\right| \leq \sum_{n \geq 1}\frac{|x_n|}{n^2} \\  &\leq \sum_{n \geq 1}\frac{\|x\|_\infty}{n^2} = \left(\sum_{n \geq 1}\frac{1}{n^2}\right)\|x\|_\infty \\ &\leq \frac{\pi^2}{6}\|x\|_2. \end{align} $$So $f$ is bounded and $\|f\| \leq \pi^2/6$. I would like to compute what exactly is this norm. The professor said that the book from where he took the exercise says that the norm is $\pi^2/(3\sqrt{10})$, which is indeed possible, but there's no comments on it. He thinks that the norm is actually that $\pi^2/6$ we have up here, but I can't come up with convenient sequences to prove or refute this. If the domain were $\ell^\infty(\mathbb{N})$ instead of $\ell^2(\mathbb{N})$ we could take $(1,1,1,\cdots)$ and the norm would be $\pi^2/6$, but this sequence is not in $\ell^2(\mathbb{N})$.
