Let $I\trianglelefteq K[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ be an ideal, and assume that the corresponding affine variety $X=V(I)\subseteq \mathbb{A}^n$ contains the origin.

(a) By example 9.15 we know that $\widetilde{\mathbb{A}^n}$ can be covered by affine spaces, with one coordinate patch being \begin{align} \mathbb{A}^n&\to \widetilde{\mathbb{A}^n}\subseteq \mathbb{A}^n\times \mathbb{P}^{n-1}\\ (x_1,y_2,\dots,y_n)&\mapsto((x_1,x_1y_2,\dots,x_1y_n),(1:y_2:\dots:y_n)). \end{align} Prove that on this coordinate patch the blow-up $\tilde X$ is given as the zero locus of the polynomials \begin{equation} \frac{f(x_1,x_1y_2,\dots,x_1y_n)}{x_1^{\min\deg f}} \end{equation} for all non-zero $f\in I$ , where $\min\deg f$ denotes the smallest degree of a monomial in $f$ . (b) Prove that the exceptional hypersurface of $\tilde X$ is \begin{equation} V_p(f^{in}:f\in I)\subseteq \{0\}\times \mathbb{P}^{n-1} \end{equation} where $f^{in}$ is the initial term of $f$ , i.e. the sum of all monomials in $f$ of smallest degree. Consequently, the tangent cone of $X$ at the origin is \begin{equation} C_0X=V_a(f^{in}:f\in I)\subseteq \mathbb{A}^n. \end{equation} (c) If $I=(f)$ is a principal ideal prove that $C_0X=V_a(f^{in})$ . However, for a general ideal $I$ , show that $C_0X$ is in general not the zero locus of the initial terms of a set of generators for $I$ . I'm stuck at (a), which I think it's related to (b) and (c).

My problem isn't about the actual definition  of the conductor but the definition of the different types of bad reductions that may occur. Please, correct me if something I have typed is wrong, since I am not totally sure about anything of what I have written here. Let $K$ be a field. We have that $E/K$ is singular if and only if $\Delta_E=0$ ( $\Delta_E$ is the discriminant of the curve $E$ ). I start by computing the discriminant $$\Delta_E=-875=-5^3\cdot 7.$$ If I do reduction modulo $p=5$ , we have $$\Delta_E\equiv_p 0.$$ Similarly I do a reduction modulo $q=7$ ; $$\Delta_E\equiv_q 0.$$ Thus, they are bad primes. My next task is to classify the reductions modulo $p$ and $q$ respectively. In the link they claim that a reduction modulo $p$ is an additive reduction while modulo $q$ is a multiplicative reduction. Before we try to solve this problem, let me just mention: (This is taken from The Arithmetic of Elliptic curves written by Silverman). The Weierstrass equation is given by $$y^2+a_1xy+a_3y=x^3+a_2x^2+a_4x+a_6.$$ We furthermore define, $$ \begin{cases} b_2=a_1^2+4a_4\\ b_4=2a_4+a_1a_3\\ c_4=b_2^2-24b_4. \end{cases} $$ Case 1 (Reduction Modulo $p$ ): In the link https://planetmath.org/badreduction , they define the reduction to be additive if the reduction has a cusp which holds if and only if both $\Delta_E$ and $c_4$ are equivalent to $0$ . Notice that $a_1=0$ and $a_4=2$ . this gives us $$b_2=8,$$ and $$b_4=4.$$ Thus $$c_4=8^2-24\cdot 4=-32\equiv_p 3.$$ Thus, I would not claim that the reduction is additive, but multiplicative. The same holds if I reduce it modulo $q$ , then it is not $0$ in $\mathbb{F}_q$ and thus I would also claim that this reduction is multiplicative, since the reducion is multiplicative if $\Delta_E$ is equivalent to $0$ , while $c_4\not = 0$ .

Since isomorphism of affine algebraic varieties is equivalent to isomorphism of coordinate rings, it's enough to show $\varphi^*$ is not surjective. We know $A(X)=\mathbb{C}[x,y]/I(X)$ where $I(X)$ is the radical ideal of $X$, and $A(\mathbb{C})=\mathbb{C}[t].$ Given the definition of $\varphi^*$, which is $x\mapsto t^2$ and $y\mapsto t^3,$ one observes that $t\in \mathbb{C}[t]$ does not lie in the image of $\varphi^*.$ This shows $\varphi$ is not an isomorphism.

70,Connection Between Étale Fundamental Group and Topological Fundamental Group,Connection Between Étale Fundamental Group and Topological Fundamental Group,,"I have some problems with the understanding of the theory of fundamental groups. I hope everything I write down here is understandable and correctly written. Let $X$ be a (smooth) complex algebraic variety. Realize the variety as a complex manifold $X(\mathbb{C})$ . This question is concerned about the connection between the étale fundamental group $$\pi_1^{\text{ét}}(X,x)$$ and the topological fundamental group $$\pi_1(X(\mathbb{C}),x).$$ More precisely, I would like to understand how I can describe the étale fundamental group by using the classical fundamental group - which should be, if I'm not mistaken; $$ \pi_1^{\text{ét}}(X,x)=\widehat{\pi_1(X(\mathbb{C}),x)}, $$ where the right hand side denotes the profinite completion of the topological fundamental group. There are a few facts I have proven. Let me begin by mentioning them. Proven Results Statement 1. If we let $X$ denote a topological space with base point $x$ , $\mathbf{Cov}(X)$ denote the category of covering spaces over $X$ , and $\pi_1(X,x)-\mathbf{Sets}$ be the category of sets equipped by a group action by the fundamental group. Then we have the following equivalence of categories $$ \mathbf{Cov}(X)\simeq \pi_1(X,x)-\mathbf{Sets} $$ Also, I have proven the following two statements: Statement 2. If $\mathbf{G}$ is a group considered as a category and $P_{\mathbf{G}}:\mathbf{G}-\mathbf{Sets}\to\mathbf{Sets}$ is the forgetful functor, then $$ \mathbf{G}\cong \operatorname{Aut}(P_{\mathbf{G}}), $$ where $\operatorname{Aut}(P_{\mathbf{G}})$ is the automorphism group of $P_{\mathbf{G}}$ . Statement 3. If $\mathbf{\hat{G}}$ denotes the profinite completion of $\mathbf{G}$ and $\hat{P}_{\mathbf{G}}:\mathbf{G}-\mathbf{FinSets}\to\mathbf{FinSets}$ is the forgetful functor from the category of profinite completion actions on finite sets to the category of finite sets, then $$ \mathbf{\hat{G}}\cong\operatorname{Aut}(\hat{P}_{\mathbf{G}}). $$ Lastly, we also have the following theorem called The Riemann Existence Theorem, which can be found in Lectures on Étale Cohomology by James Milne (see page 28): Riemann Existence Theorem. Let $X$ be a nonsingular variety over $\mathbb{C}$ . The functor sending a finite étale covering $(Y,\pi)$ of $X$ to the finite covering space $(Y(\mathbb{C}),\pi)$ of $X(\mathbb{C})$ is an equivalence of categories. A Quest to Prove the Isomorphism I had a discussion with a professor (not too long ago) over Zoom, he told me that the above is enough to find the connection between the fundamental groups. But I am not exactly sure how. In the notes, this is how professor Milne gave the proof From the Riemann Existence Theorem it follows that the étale universal covering space $\widetilde{X}=(X_i)_{i\in I}$ of $X$ has the property that every finite topological covering space of $X(\mathbb{C})$ is a quotient of some $X_i(\mathbb{C})$ . Let $x$ any element of $X(\mathbb{C})$ . Then $$\pi_1^{\text{ét}}(X,x)=\varprojlim_i\operatorname{Aut}_X(X_i)=\varprojlim_i\operatorname{Aut}_{X(\mathbb{C})}(X_i(\mathbb{C})) =\widehat{\pi_1(X(\mathbb{C}),x)}.$$ I cannot see how anything I have proven comes into the picture in the above quotation. Questions Question 1. To use the results I have proven I guess I would like to put $\mathbf{G}=\pi_1(X(\mathbb{C}),x)$ in Statement 2 and Statement 3? This gives us $$ \pi_1(X(\mathbb{C}),x)\cong\operatorname{Aut}(P_{\mathbf{G}}) \\ \widehat{\pi_1(X(\mathbb{C}),x)}\cong \operatorname{Aut}(\hat{P}_{\mathbf{G}}) $$ where do I go from where? Question 2. To make The Riemann Existence Theorem more compact, let $\mathbf{FinÉtCov}(X)$ denote the category of finite étale coverings of $X$ and $\mathbf{FinCov}(X(\mathbb{C}))$ denote the finite covers of the topological space. Then the theorem says $$ (1)\text{ }\text{ }\text{ }\mathbf{FinÉtCov}(X)\simeq\mathbf{FinCov}(X(\mathbb{C})) $$ As given in Statement 1, I have the following equivalence $$(2)\text{ }\text{ }\text{ }\mathbf{Cov}(X(\mathbb{C}))\simeq \pi_1(X(\mathbb{C}),x)-\mathbf{Sets}.$$ The two equivalence just given are not exactly the same, but ""almost"". Can I use the above equivalence somehow? I am quite sure I cannot do it like this, but something similar to $$\mathbf{FinCov}(X(\mathbb{C}))\simeq\pi_1(X(\mathbb{C}),x)-\mathbf{Sets}?$$ I don't think I can use the above because $(1)$ is about finite covers, when $(2)$ is not. After having done the above, then I could replace the fundamental group, with the automorphism group of the forgetful functor. But this seems just like it is making things much more complicated for me. I'm just trying to use all of the results I have proved. ´Something which bothers me is that I want to prove that two groups are isomorphic. But right now, everything I am doing is at a category-theoretical level - which makes me confused. I want to do things at a group-theoretic level. Question 3. At the end of the day, I would like someone to help me put everything together. Maybe someone can give me a guiding hand and tell me how this relates to what Milne did? Maybe there are more work to do before I can prove the isomorphism? I would be really happy if someone could help me get a better understanding of this problem.

It is well known, that $\mathcal{L}_{G/B}(\lambda)$ is globally generated exactly when $\lambda$ is dominant with respect to the Borel subgroup opposite to $B$ (or equivalently $\langle \lambda, \alpha^\vee \rangle \geq 0$ for all simple roots $\alpha \in S$). I thought that $\lambda$ is dominant if and only if $\langle \lambda, \alpha^\vee \rangle \geq 0$. But why respect to the Borel subgroup opposite to $B$? Is this because of the convention regarding the opposite Borel subgroups, or is it just a typo? I am more familiar with Lie groups and practically know nothing about algebraic groups. Is there a basic reference which explains this kind of convention in detail? Why is such convention necessary or has advantage?",,"['algebraic-geometry', 'representation-theory', 'algebraic-groups', 'root-systems']"

91,Formal expansion of differential form on elliptic curves,Formal expansion of differential form on elliptic curves,,"First of all everything i'm asking about comes from the beginning of Katz and Mazur's book : Arithmetic moduli of elliptic curves (which you can find here ). I'm considering an elliptic curve  $f : E \to S$ where $S$ is a scheme (i.e. $E$ is a proper smooth $S$-group scheme of relative dimension $1$, with a chosen section $0 : S \to E$). I'm a trying to understand what KM are doing on page 68/69. Since $E \to S$ is separated we know that $D := 0(S)$ is a closed subscheme, it is in fact proven in KM that $D$ is a relative effective cartier divisor i.e. $D \to S$ is flat and $I(D)$ is an invertible sheaf. We write $\omega_{E/S} = 0^*\Omega^1_{E/S} = f_* \Omega^1_{E/S}$. This is a line bundle so Zariski locally on $S$ it is generated by a global section $\omega$. Now they say 1) Zariski locally on $S$, the formal completion of $E$ along $0$ i.e. $Spf(\varprojlim \mathcal{O}_E/I(D)^n)$ is isomorphic to $Spf(R[[T]])$ where $S = Spec(R)$. This in turn, implies (they say) that 2) Zariski locally on $S$, $\omega$ can be written in the form $f(T)dT$ where $f(T) \in R[[T]]$. How does one prove that first fact (I get that for open affine $U = Spec(A)$ containing $0(D)$ we have $A = R \oplus I(D)$ where $I(D)$ is the free ideal of rank $1$ corresponding to $D$, and that by iterating this we get a morphism $A \to R[[T]]$ but i don't know how to go from there).
