4,On the proof of existence of algebraic closure using Zorn's Lemma in Patrick Morandi's *Field and Galois Theory*,On the proof of existence of algebraic closure using Zorn's Lemma in Patrick Morandi's *Field and Galois Theory*,,"I am studying from Patrick Morandi's Field and Galois Theory , and on page 32 he proves the existence of an algebraic closure of an arbitrary field, as follows: Lemma 3.13. If $K/F$ is algebraic, then $|K| \leq \max\{ |F|,|\mathbb{N}| \}$ . Theorem 3.14. Let $F$ be a field. Then $F$ has an algebraic closure. Proof. Let $S$ be a set containing $F$ with $|S| > \max\{ |F|, |\mathbb{N}| \}$ . Let $\mathcal{A}$ be the set of all algebraic extension fields of $F$ inside $S$ . Then $\mathcal{A}$ is ordered by defining $K \leq L$ if $L$ is an extension field of $K$ . By Zorn's lemma, there is a maximal element $M$ of $\mathcal{A}$ . We claim that $M$ is an algebraic closure of $F$ . To show that $M$ is algebraically closed, let $L$ be an algebraic extension of $M$ . By Lemma 3.13, $$ |L| \leq \max\{ |M|, |\mathbb{N}| \} \leq \max\{ |F|,|\mathbb{N}| \} < |S|. $$ Thus, there is a function $f:L \to S$ with $f|_M = \operatorname{id}$ . By defining $+$ and $\cdot$ on $f(L)$ by $f(a) + f(b) = f(a+b)$ and $f(a) \cdot f(b) = f(ab)$ , we see that $f(L)$ is a field extension of $M$ and $f$ is a field homomorphism. Maximality of $M$ shows that $f(L) = M$ . Thus, $M$ is algebraically closed. Since $M$ is algebraic over $F$ , we see that $M$ is an algebraic closure of $F$ . $\tag*{$\blacksquare$}$ I do not understand the second line in the proof, where he says Let $\mathcal{A}$ be the set of all algebraic extension fields of $F$ inside $S$ . Since we are assuming $S$ is just a set containing $K$ and so it does not have any field structure defined on it a priori , how can we talk about field extensions of $F$ contained in $S$ ? The rough idea that I am currently keeping in mind is that we take an algebraic extension $K$ of $F$ and then use a bijection of this set onto a subset of $S$ to define the addition and multiplication on this subset, in the same way we do later on for $L$ . And then we possibly do this process for every algebraic extension of $K$ . But then what I don't see at all is how to ensure that the different mappings are compatible with each other. And, if I have two isomorphic algebraic extensions of $K$ , do I then map it to the same subset of $S$ or something? It would be really helpful if someone could guide me in filling out the details here.","I am studying from Patrick Morandi's Field and Galois Theory , and on page 32 he proves the existence of an algebraic closure of an arbitrary field, as follows: Lemma 3.13.

For instance, in a finite cyclic group of order $n=4,$ i.e. $\mathbb Z_4=\{0,1,2,3\}$ the element $1$ moves all elements of the set by $1,$ while the element $2$ moves them by $2,$ etc. Now in the composition table, as an example, $1\;\circ\;3$ will move the elements first by $1,$ and later by $3,$ resulting in no move $(\mathbb Z/ 4\mathbb Z).$ The point being that the ""effect"" (I would like to say ""action"", but the word is taken to signify the action of a group on a set) of the binary operation is already somehow within the actual elements. In other words, the elements of the set are not inert or passive. They don't seem to be waiting for the definition of the operation - they carry with them a generating ""action"", which seems to overlap or preempt the role of the binary operation.

24,Quotient of nilpotent group is nilpotent,Quotient of nilpotent group is nilpotent,,"Edit: I managed to rephrase my proof in a way that does not resort to coset multiplication. I think the resulting proof is better. I've added it as an answer below, while preserving the original question to avoid wrecking the context. In his book Finite Group Theory , section 1.D, Isaacs mentions without proof the following result: Proposition 1: If $G$ is a nilpotent group and $H \lhd G$, then $G/H$ is nilpotent. I think I have a proof but would appreciate confirmation and any suggestions for improvement. Isaacs' definition is that $G$ is nilpotent if it has a central series: $G$ is nilpotent if it has a central series, meaning that there are subgroups $N_i \lhd G$ such that $1 = N_0 \leq N_1 \leq \cdots \leq N_r = G$ and $N_i / N_{i-1} \leq Z(G / N_{i-1})$. I would like to work directly with this definition rather than with upper or lower central series. The reasons for this: (1) Isaacs' treatment of upper central series assumes that the group is finite, and uses the result I am trying to prove in order to establish the equivalence between ""$G$ has a central series"" and ""$G$ has an upper central series which reaches $G$""; (2) lower central series are not covered until a later chapter. Initially I tried to prove this by defining $M_i = N_i H / H$ and attempting to show that this results in a central series. I think I made it work using a somewhat messy argument involving the isomorphism and correspondence theorems, but then it occurred to me that instead it suffices to prove the following result: Proposition 2: If $G$ is nilpotent and $\phi : G \to H$ is an epimorphism, then $H$ is nilpotent. Then we can apply this to the canonical epimorphism $\phi : G \to G/H$ given by $\phi(g) = gH$, which gives the desired result. Proof: We have $N_i \lhd G$ and $1 = N_0 \leq N_1 \leq \cdots \leq N_r = G$, with $N_i / N_{i-1} \leq Z(G / N_{i-1})$. The latter condition can be stated equivalently as follows: if $n \in N_i$ and $g \in G$, then $ngN_{i-1} = gnN_{i-1}$. Now define $M_i = \phi(N_i)$ for every $0 \leq i \leq r$. Note that $M_0 = \phi(N_0) = \phi(1) = 1$, and $M_r = \phi(N_r) = \phi(G) = H$. Also, $M_i \lhd H$ by the correspondence theorem since $N_i \lhd G$. Now, let $m \in M_i$ and $h \in H$. To show that $M_i / M_{i-1} \leq Z(H / M_{i-1})$, it suffices to show that $mhM_{i-1} = hmM_{i-1}$. We have $m = \phi(n)$ and $h = \phi(g)$ for some $n \in N_i$ and $g \in G$. Then $mhM_{i-1} = \phi(ngN_{i-1}) = \phi(gnN_{i-1}) = hmM_{i-1}$, where the second equality holds because $N_{i} / N_{i-1} \leq Z(G / N_{i-1})$. We conclude that $1 = M_0 \leq M_1 \leq \cdots\leq M_r = H$ is a central series for $H$, so $H$ is nilpotent.","Edit: I managed to rephrase my proof in a way that does not resort to coset multiplication.

Let $a_i$ be in $G \setminus S$. Then $(a_i)^2$ is $e$, is it? If we rearrange the elements on the left side of the equation above according to what belongs to $S$ and what belongs to $G \setminus S$ and take the product of all the $(a_i)^2$, then every element belonging to $G \setminus S$ will  be cancelled in the right side of $a_1a_2...a_na_1a_2...a_n = e$. So, we only need to consider the elements in $S$. Suppose $a_j \in S$. Let $a_k$ be the inverse of $a_j$. We need to prove $(a_j)^2 \cdot (a_k)^2 = a_j \cdot a_j \cdot a_k \cdot a_k = e$. Since $S$ is abelian , $a_j \cdot a_j \cdot a_k \cdot a_k$ can be rearranged as $a_j \cdot a_k \cdot a_j \cdot a_k$ which is $e$.",,"['abstract-algebra', 'group-theory']"

Proof. If there were a field K with $|K| = p^n = q$ , then $K^* = K - \{0\}$ would be a multiplicative group of order q-1; by Lagrange's theorem $a^{q-1}=1$ for all $a \in K^*$ . It follows that every element of K would be a root of the polynomial $$g(x)=x^q - x.$$ We now begin the construction. By Kronecker's theorem, there is a field E containing $\Bbb{Z}_p$ over which g(x) splits. Define $F = \{\alpha \in E: g(\alpha)=0\}$ ; that is, F is the set of all the roots of g(x). Since the derivative $g'(x)=qx^{q-1} - 1 = -1$ (because $q=p^n$ and E has characteristic p), Lemma 32 shows that the gcd (g,g')=1, and so g(x) has no repeated roots; that is, $|F|=q=p^n$ . We claim that F is a field, which will complete the proof...
