Each of these functions produced a curve of the same shape as the previous.

The OP of this question was, in effect, seeking an explicit inverse to the function $$f(x) = x + \left[ \frac{x}{2} \right]$$ where $[n]$ denotes the rounding function, i.e. outputs $n$ rounded to the nearest integer. It turned out the OP was mistaken and meant to ask about a different function, but this brought about an interesting thought as I played around with it. The Problem / My Questions: Let $f$ be as defined previously. On an intuitive glance at the graph of this function, we can see it is injective: However, a rigorous proof of this (i.e. $f(x_1) = f(x_2) \implies x_1 = x_2$ ) eludes me, namely because of that rounding function. The function $g(x) = x$ is injective, yet $h(x) = [x/2]$ isn't (consider $x_1 = 2$ and $x_2 = 2.2$ ). So obviously it is possible to have an injective function which is the sum of two functions which are not necessarily injective. I've tried rigorously proving the injectivity of $f$ , making use of various identities from Wikipedia - you can express $[n]$ as $\lfloor n + 0.5 \rfloor$ , so since this page had lots of identities (as opposed to their rounding function page) I figured it'd be useful. No real headway, though. Which brings up my questions: How would one prove the injectivity of $f$ ? So far in my coursework I've typically only done so from the definition. Perhaps there's a different trick to use in this case - a property of injective functions perhaps, or perhaps a property of the rounding, floor, or ceiling functions? How would one find the inverse of $f$ ? Clearly, to each $x$ , there is a unique $f(x)$ , so, in theory, it seems like you'd be able to invert the function, to be able to express $x$ in terms of $f(x)$ . This obviously isn't true for the related three functions $$a(x) = \lfloor x \rfloor = \text{floor}(x) \;\;\;\;\;\; b(x) = \lceil x \rceil = \text{ceiling}(x) \;\;\;\;\;\; c(x) = [x] = \text{round}(x)$$ but it seems like introducing the lone $x$ term (as in $f$ ) that would normally change the dynamic.

By looking at the series expansion for Sin, it's clear that Sin approximates to $\frac{1}{1+x}$ for large x, as the higher-power entries in the series $\frac{1}{1+x}^3 + \frac{1}{1+x}^5 + ...$ would disappear faster, but would it be sufficient to state this?

I am told the following: At $r = 0$, we have $f_r = x^3 + 1$, and this only has a turning point   at $x = 0$, but the second derivative is also $0$ at this point. I am struggling to understand the point this statement is trying to make. It says that ""at $r = 0$, we have $f_r = x^3 + 1$, and this only has a turning point at $x = 0$"", but then it says "" but the second derivative is also $0$ at this point""; the way it is phrased seems to imply that it is trying to make some contrasting point between these two statements, but I am not understanding what this is? Since the second derivative is $0$ at the point, it means that it is an inflection point. But this doesn't mean that the function is not injective at this point, right? For instance, $f(x) = x^3$ has a turning point at $x = 0$, but its second derivative is also $0$ at this point, and $f(x) = x^3$ is injective (one-to-one). The function would still be injective for $r = 0$, right? Just because the derivative is positive at all points except $x = 0$ does not necessarily mean that the function is not injective at this point? Finally, I think my problem is that I'm struggling to understand what the presence of inflection points mean for injectivity. What DO the presence of inflection points mean for injectivity? I would greatly appreciate it if people could please take the time to clarify this.","I have a function $f_r : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ defined as $f_r(x) = x^3 + rx + 1$.
