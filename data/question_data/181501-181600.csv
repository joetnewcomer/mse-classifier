9,"""Del"" operator vs Vectors","""Del"" operator vs Vectors",,"I'm reading about the del operator on wikipedia, there is a section called ""Precautions"" ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del#Precautions ) that I'm trying to understand for the last 4 hours. Here is what it says, I've highlighted the parts I don't quite understand. Most of the above vector properties (except for those that rely explicitly on del's differential properties—for example, the product rule) rely only on symbol rearrangement, and must necessarily hold if the del symbol is replaced by any other vector. This is part of the value to be gained in notationally representing this operator as a vector . Though one can often replace del with a vector and obtain a vector identity, making those identities mnemonic , the reverse is ''not'' necessarily reliable, because del does not commute in general. A counterexample that relies on del's failure to commute:   :\begin{align}               (\vec u \cdot \vec v) f &\equiv (\vec v \cdot \vec u) f \\               (\nabla \cdot \vec v) f &= \left (\frac{\partial v_x}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v_y}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial v_z}{\partial z} \right )f                                         = \frac{\partial v_x}{\partial x}f + \frac{\partial v_y}{\partial y}f + \frac{\partial v_z}{\partial z}f \\               (\vec v \cdot \nabla) f &= \left (v_x \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + v_y \frac{\partial}{\partial y} + v_z \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \right )f                                         = v_x \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + v_y \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} + v_z \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \\   \Rightarrow (\nabla \cdot \vec v) f &\ne (\vec v \cdot \nabla) f \\ \end{align} A counterexample that relies on del's differential properties:   : \begin{align}   (\nabla x) \times (\nabla y) &= \left (\vec e_x \frac{\partial x}{\partial x}+\vec e_y \frac{\partial x}{\partial y}+\vec e_z \frac{\partial x}{\partial z} \right ) \times \left (\vec e_x \frac{\partial y}{\partial x}+\vec e_y \frac{\partial y}{\partial y}+\vec e_z \frac{\partial y}{\partial z} \right ) \\                                &= (\vec e_x \cdot 1 +\vec e_y \cdot 0+\vec e_z \cdot 0) \times (\vec e_x \cdot 0+\vec e_y \cdot 1+\vec e_z \cdot 0) \\                                &= \vec e_x  \times \vec e_y \\                                &= \vec e_z \\   (\vec u x )\times (\vec u y) &= x y (\vec u \times \vec u) \\                                &= x y \vec 0 \\                                &= \vec 0 \end{align} Central to these distinctions is the fact that del is not simply a vector; it is a vector operator. Whereas a vector is an object with both a magnitude and direction, del has neither a magnitude nor a direction until it operates on a function.

Thank you.","I'm reading about the del operator on wikipedia, there is a section called ""Precautions"" ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del#Precautions ) that I'm trying to understand for the last 4 hours. Here is what it says, I've highlighted the parts I don't quite understand. Most of the above vector properties (except for those that rely explicitly on del's differential properties—for example, the product rule) rely only on symbol rearrangement, and must necessarily hold if the del symbol is replaced by any other vector. This is part of the value to be gained in notationally representing this operator as a vector . Though one can often replace del with a vector and obtain a vector identity, making those identities mnemonic , the reverse is ''not'' necessarily reliable, because del does not commute in general.

96,Correct Intepretation of Total Derivative,Correct Intepretation of Total Derivative,,"My question is how should the total derivative (and functions in general) be interpreted in the multivariate case. I came up with two different ways and wish to know which is the agreed upon way. Let's say we have the following function of f(x(y), y): $$f(x(y), y)=x^2 + yx + y^2$$ x is a function of y following the relation: $$x=2y$$ Now, the there is no ambiguity for total derivative of y. It's simply the derivative of $(2y)^2+y(2y)+y^2$ with respect to y (alternatively the formula for total derivative can be used yielding the same result). The derivative equals $8y+4y+2y = 14y$ The total derivative of x on the other hand depends what we define the function sign to mean. If we define that x does not affect y, so that y is an independent variable (giving a not strict relationship for the above equation), then the total derivative reduces only to the direct effect x has on the function and is simply the partial derivative, giving: $$\large \frac{\partial f(x,y)}{\partial x} = 2x+y$$ However, this is might be the wrong interpretation. Since x is a function of y, then by y must also be a function of x, if the 2nd equation presented is interpreted as strict relationship (rather than as dependent/independent variable). Thus we can solve for $y = \frac{x}{2}$ and then the total derivative with respect to x can be obtained from $$4\large x^2+x(0.5x) + (0.5x)^2 \rightarrow \large 2x+x+0.5x= 3.5x$$ Which of these is the correct interpretation? Both of the relationships of course can hold, so the question becomes whether $f(x(y), (y))$ is even a possible function or should we write it as $f(x(y), y(x))$. Then we should use completely different notation involving sub variables for the case where x depends on y but the relationship does not swing the other way around giving for example $f(x(t,z), y(t))$.","My question is how should the total derivative (and functions in general) be interpreted in the multivariate case.
