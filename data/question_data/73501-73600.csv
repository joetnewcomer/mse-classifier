12,Does the product functor preserve quotient maps?,Does the product functor preserve quotient maps?,,"In Hatcher's Algebraic Topology , he presents a proof that if $(X,A)$ satisfies the homotopy extension property, and $A$ is contractible, then $X \simeq X/A$. Part of Hatcher's proof goes: Suppose that $q: X \to X/A$ is the quotient map. Taking a homotopy $f : X \times I \to X$ such that $f_t(A) \subseteq A$ for all $t$, he then reasons that $q \circ f: X \times A \to X /A$ descends to a homotopy $X /A \times I \to X/A$. It's clear to me how to define such a map for each $t$. I asked myself why a map defined that way for each $t$ should then be continuous on $X /A \times I$, and I wasn't sure. One way that we could guarantee it was continuous is if $q \times 1_I: X \times I \to X/A \times I$ had the characteristic property of the quotient. But I'm not sure whether this is the case. My questions are Is he reasoning that if $\varphi: S \to \overline{S}$ is a quotient map, then $\varphi \times 1_T: S \times T \to \overline{S} \times T$ is a quotient map for any topological space $T$? [ Edit: this is not true.] What is going on here categorically?

Part of Hatcher's proof goes: Suppose that $q: X \to X/A$ is the quotient map. Taking a homotopy $f : X \times I \to X$ such that $f_t(A) \subseteq A$ for all $t$, he then reasons that $q \circ f: X \times A \to X /A$ descends to a homotopy $X /A \times I \to X/A$. It's clear to me how to define such a map for each $t$. I asked myself why a map defined that way for each $t$ should then be continuous on $X /A \times I$, and I wasn't sure. One way that we could guarantee it was continuous is if $q \times 1_I: X \times I \to X/A \times I$ had the characteristic property of the quotient. But I'm not sure whether this is the case. My questions are Is he reasoning that if $\varphi: S \to \overline{S}$ is a quotient map, then $\varphi \times 1_T: S \times T \to \overline{S} \times T$ is a quotient map for any topological space $T$?

The sup metric is $d_{\infty}(f,g) = \sup \left\{|f(x) - g(x)| : a \leq x \leq b \right\}$ for $f,g\in C[a,b]$ Clearly $C^1[a,b] \subset C[a,b]$ $C^1[a,b]$ is a closed subset of $C[a,b]$ if $C[a,b]\backslash C^1[a,b]$ is open in $C[a,b]$ - i.e. $\forall h \in C[a,b]\backslash C^1[a,b]$, $\exists \epsilon > 0$ such that $\left\{ f \in C[a,b] : d_{\infty}(f,h) < \epsilon \right\} \subseteq C[a,b]\backslash C^1[a,b]$ Which seems to be saying that, essentially, for any non-differentiable continuous function $h$ we can find an $\epsilon > 0$ such that when the supremum of the distance between $h$ and all other continuous functions on $[a,b]$ is less than $\epsilon$, then they will also not be differentiable. This is where I get stuck, not least because I'm not convinced whether that is true or not. Clearly, it's easily possible to create further non-differentiable functions by, for example, moving one point of $h$ less than $\epsilon$. My instinct is that you're not going to be able to turn a non-differentiable function into a differentiable one with an arbitrarily small $\epsilon$, so I think such an $\epsilon$ exists - but this obviously isn't formal (or even likely to be correct) Thanks.",,"['general-topology', 'metric-spaces']"

If $p:\tilde X\to X$ is a covering map, $x_0\in X,\ \tilde x_0\in p^{-1}(x_0),$ then the induced homomorphism $p_*:\pi(\tilde X,\tilde x_0)\to\pi(X,x_0)$ of the fundamental groups is a monomorphism.

By the first theorem it is also a monomorphism, and so it is an isomorphism between $\pi_1(\tilde X,\tilde x_0)$ and $\pi_1(X,x_0).$ Therefore, $[\pi_1(X,x_0):p_*(\pi_1(\tilde X,\tilde x_0))]=1,$ and, by the second theorem, the degree of $p$ is $1$, a contradiction with the added hypothesis. Is this correct? I think it's probably not, because I'm not using the finiteness of $p$. The finiteness of $p$ means, according to the theorem that the index mentioned before is finite. But I can't see at all why that should be necessary. The only example I know of an infinite covering map is $e^{it}$ covering the unit circle with the real line. But here there are plenty of loops that have no ""loopy"" lifts because there are no nontrivial loops in the real line, and there are many in the circle.

Note that I want to prove this without using the Heine-Borel theorem and the equivalence of sequential compactness and compactness.

Then $\exists a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $S \subseteq [a,b]\times [a,b] \times ...[a,b]$.  Now I will consider a sequence in $S$. Let $x_p = (x_p^1, x_p^2,...,x_p^n) \forall p \in  \mathbb{N}$. Then I will construct $n$ sequences of components of $x_p$. Let $x^{(i)}=x_1^i,x_2^i...$  Then $x^{(1)}\subset [a,b]$, and $[a,b]$ is sequentially compact. so  $x^{(1)}$ has a convergent subsequence. Now if we denote the indices of this sequence by $t_1,t_2...$ we know that $x^1_{t_1},x^1_{t_2}, x^1_{t_3}...$ converges to some $x$ in $[a,b]$.

Again we take the indices of this subsequence and we consider them to build a subsequence of $x_3$ which converges. After we have repeated this procedure $n$ times we are left with $n$ we have found a set of indices $f_1,f_2...$ such that $x^n_{f_1}, x^n_{f_2}...$ converges. But then by construction $x^p_{f_1}, x^p_{f_2}...$ converges $\forall  p \in1..n$ as it is a subsequence of a convergent sequence. Then $x_{f_1},x_{f_2} ..$ converges (as it is a sequence in  $\mathbb{R}^n$ for which all individual components converge) and as it is included in a closed set, the limit of the sequence is part of the set.

So, I would need to either show that both $X_1$ and $X_2$ are deformation retracts of some space, or homeomorphic to some deformation retracts of this larger space. Since n-cells are homeomorphic to the balls $\mathbb{B}^n$, ( with $\mathbb{B}^n$ we are denoting the closed n-ball here) the idea would be to consider the larger adjunction space $X\bigcup_{\phi}\mathbb{B}^n\times I$, where the attaching map $\phi:\mathbb{B}^n\times \{0\}\rightarrow X$ would be given by $\phi(x,0)=f(x)$, where $f:\mathbb{B}^n\rightarrow X$ would be some continuous map. On the other hand we know that $X_1$ is the space obtained from $X$ by attaching an $n$-cell, so it is homeomorphic to an adjunction space, more specifically: $X\bigcup_{f_1}\mathbb{B}^n$, where $f_1:\partial\mathbb{B}^n\rightarrow X,$ is the corresponding attaching map.

Let me mention, that for any $i\in I$ , $\epsilon >0$ and $x\in X$ , the sets $$B^i_{\epsilon}(x):=\{y\in X: p_i(y-x)<\epsilon\}$$ form a subbase of the initial topology of the mappings $q_i: X \rightarrow X/\ker(p_i)$ , $i\in I$ . Note: There is a norm $\lVert\cdot\rVert:X/\ker(p_i)\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ , such that $p_i=\lVert q_i\rVert$ , especially $p_i(y-x)=\lVert q_i(y)-q_i(x)\rVert$ . Then, $B^i_{\epsilon}(x)=q_i^{-1}[ B_\epsilon^{X/\ker(p_i)} (q_i(x))] $ , i.e. can be written as preimage of $q_i$ of an $\epsilon$ -ball in $X/\ker(p_i)$ . I want to prove the following statement: A topological vector space $(X,\tau)$ is a locally convex space, if it contains a neighborhood basis of $0$ of convex sets. Proof of the statement: Every convex neighborhood of $0$ contains an open convex balanced neighborhood of $0$ . Therefore one can find a neighborhood basis of $0$ of open convex balanced sets, which will be denoted as $\mathcal{B}^{disc}$ . Then one can prove, that the family of Minkowski functionals $$\{p_U: U\in\mathcal{B}^{disc}\}$$ is a separating family of seminorms, which are continuous with respect to $\tau$ . Moreover, for any $U\in \mathcal{B}^{disc}$ , it holds $U=\{x\in X: p_U(x)<1\}.$ Now, it is only left to show, that the initial topology with respect to the quotient mappings $q_U: X \rightarrow X/\ker(p_U)$ , $U\in \mathcal{B}^{disc}$ coinicides with $\tau$ . For this, I am not sure, if my proof for $\tau\subset \tau^{init}$ is right. Proof: $\tau^{init}\subset \tau:$ For any $U\in \mathcal{B}^{disc}$ , the seminorm $p_U$ is continuous with respect to $\tau$ . Then, for any $U\in \mathcal{B}^{disc}$ , $\epsilon >0$ , $x\in X$ , one finds $B^U_\epsilon(x)=(\epsilon U)+x\in\tau$ , since translation and scalar multiplication are homeomorphisms, i.e. all subbase sets of $\tau^{init}$ are contained in $\tau$ , such that $\tau^{init}\subset \tau$ . $\tau\subset \tau^{init}:$ Pick any $V\in \tau$ . For any $x\in V$ , the set $V-x$ is an $\tau-$ open neighborhood of $0$ , since translations are homeomorphisms. This means, for any $x\in V$ , one can find a $\tau-$ open $U^x\in\mathcal{B}^{disc}$ , such that $U^x\subseteq V-x$ , leading to $U^x+x\subseteq V$ and $\cup_{x\in V}(U^x+x) = V$ . However, any $U^x+x\in \tau^{init}$ , since $$U^x+x = \{y+x\in X: p_{U^x}(y)<1\}=\{z\in X: p_{U^x}(z-x)<1\}=B_1^{U^x}(x)\in \tau^{init}.$$ This yields $$V = \cup_{x\in V}(U^x+x) = \cup_{x\in V}B_1^{U^x}(x)\in \tau^{init}.$$ Here is what is confusing for me overall: I have shown, that $\tau^{init}\subset \tau$ and that any set in $\tau$ can be written as a union of sets in of the subbase of $\tau^{init}$ . However, wouldn't this imply, that any set of the initial topology could be written as union of sets of the subbase? This shouldn't be true, since a subbase is not necessarily a base, right? Is there anything wrong with my proof, or am I just running in circles for another reason? Further thoughts on this: Please correct me, if I am wrong with this. If $\mathcal{B}^{disc}$ is a open neighborhood basis of $0$ , then $\{U+x:U\in \mathcal{B}^{disc}, x\in E\}$ should be a base of $\tau$ . (Again using, that translation with $x$ is a homeomorphism.) Once again, you can rewrite $$U+x = \{y+x\in X: p_U(y)<1\}=\{z\in X: p_U(z-x)<1\}=B^U_1(x),$$ such that the mentioned subbase contains a base for $\tau$ . Since $\tau^{init}\subset \tau$ , it is a base for $\tau^{init}$ . But then it seems, that the definition I stated above is slightly more general? Is there some definition for something like a convex neighborhood subbasis ? Any hint or help is appreciated!
