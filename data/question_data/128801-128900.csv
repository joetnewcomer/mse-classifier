If it is at all relevant for the answer keep in mind that this question arises from the study of the rotational symmetry of quantum operators on a lattice. I have a system with a symmetry described by a finite group $G$ of order $n_G$ . (the point group in question is the cubic group $O$ of order 24 (it is isomorphic to $S_4$ )). I have a set of objects (operators) $\{\hat{O}_i\}$ spanning a vector space of operators, we will call $H = \text{Span}\{\hat{O}_i\}$ . I have already managed by hand to build the reducible representation $\mathcal{R}$ acting on the $\{\hat{O}_i\}$ basis. I already know ho to compute the Kronecker decomposition of $\mathcal{R}$ by calculating the multiplicities of each irreducible representation of the group using the character tables. I need to find linear combinations of these $\{\hat{O}_i\}$ : $$ \overline{O}^\mu_a = \sum_i c^\mu_{a,i}\hat{O}_i $$ Such that $\overline{O}^\mu_a$ transforms according to an irreducible representation of the point group symmetry.

In literature I have found that we can do this using projection operators and both the objects: $$ \frac{\dim \Gamma^\mu}{n_G}\sum_{g\in G} {\Gamma^\mu}(g)^\dagger_{ab} \mathcal{R}(g)_{ij}\hat{O}_j \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \text{and} \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \sum_{g \in G} \chi^\mu(g)^*\mathcal{R}(g)_{ij}\hat{O}_i $$ should transform according to the $\Gamma^\mu$ representation because of the great orthogonality theorem.

Then we show that $A$ acts regularly on $F$ and hence $FA$ is a Frobenius group if $A \ne 1$ . Next, we show that $A$ is nilpotent. Then, by properties of Frobenius complements, $A$ must be one of the alternatives described in case (ii). Now if $G = FA$ , then we are done (case (ii)). Otherwise, if $G$ properly contains $FA$ , we show that $\pi(F)$ consists of a single prime $p$ , i.e., $F$ is a $p$ -group. Let $P$ be a Sylow $p$ -subgroup of $G$ . Then $P$ necessarily contains $F$ , and $G = PA$ . Note that $A$ is a $p'$ -group and $F = O_p(G)$ . We may assume $A \ne 1$ else we would be in case (i). Next, we write $\overline{G} = \overline{P}\mbox{ }\overline{A}$ where the bars denote reduction modulo $F = O_p(G)$ .

The definitions I have to work with are: \begin{align*}  \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z} & = [0,1) \text{ with addition mod $1$} \\  S^1 & =  \{z \in \mathbb{C}^{*} \mid |z| = 1\} \text{ with multiplication.}  \end{align*} Though it seems natural to use the first isomorphism theorem, I don't yet have access to it, so I need to use the bijection $t \mapsto \exp(2 \pi i t)$ . Here is my attempt at a proof. Define $\varphi: \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z} \to S^1$ by $\varphi(t) = \exp(2 \pi i t)$ . We first show that $\varphi$ is a homomorphism. Homomorphism. Let $a,b \in \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ . We denote addition in $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ by $*$ and addition in $\mathbb{R}$ by $+$ . If $a + b < 1$ , then $a * b = a + b$ , and we have \begin{align*} \varphi(a * b) & = \varphi(a + b) \\ & = \exp^{2 \pi (a + b) i} \\ & = \exp(2 a \pi i + 2 b \pi i) \\ & = \exp(2 a \pi i) \exp(2 b \pi i) \\ & = \varphi(a) \varphi(b). \end{align*} Now suppose that $a + b \geq 1$ . Then $a*b = a + b - 1$ , and we have \begin{align*} \varphi(a * b) & = \varphi(a + b - 1) \\ & = \exp(2 \pi (a + b - 1) i) \\ & = \exp(2 \pi a i + 2 \pi b i - 2 \pi i) \\ & = \exp(2 \pi a i) \exp(2 \pi b i) \exp(-2 \pi i) \\ & = \varphi(a) \cdot \varphi(b) \cdot 1 \\ & = \varphi(a) \varphi(b),  \end{align*} so $\varphi$ is a bijective homomorphism and therefore an isomorphism. We next show that $\varphi$ is a bijection of sets. Injectivity. For injectivity, we show that $\mathrm{ker}(\varphi) = \{0\}$ . For any $t \in [0,1)$ , we have \begin{align*} t \in \mathrm{ker}(\varphi) & \iff \varphi(t) = \exp(2 \pi i t) = 1 \\ & \iff \cos(2\pi) + i \sin(2\pi t) = 1 + 0i \\ & \iff \sin(2 \pi t) = 0 \\ & \iff t \in \mathbb{Z} \cap [0,1) \\ & \iff t = 0, \end{align*} so $\mathrm{ker}(\varphi) = \{0\}$ , so $\varphi$ is injective. Surjective. Let $z \in S^1$ , and write $z$ in its exponential form $z = \exp^{i \theta}$ where $\theta \in [0,2\pi)$ .

23,Homomorphisms from $S_3$ to $\mathbb{Z}/10\mathbb{Z}$,Homomorphisms from  to,S_3 \mathbb{Z}/10\mathbb{Z},"I want to check if my line of thought is correct. We need to find all homomorphisms $\phi: G=S_3\rightarrow H=\mathbb{Z}/10\mathbb{Z}$ . We already know that $\phi(g)=\bar{0}$ for all $g\in G$ is a possible homomorphism, so we can assume that $\phi(g)=\bar{m}$ for some $0<m\leq 9$ . Now, if $n$ is the order of $g$ , $n=o(g)$ , we have that $n\bar{m}=\bar{0}$ so that $o(\bar{m})\mid n$ and, therefore, $o(\bar{m})$ is a common divisor of $10$ and $6$ , hence either $1$ or $2$ . Since we are excluding $m=0$ , we get that $m=5$ , that is, if $\phi$ is a non-trivial homomorphism from $G$ to $H$ we must carry some non-trivial element of $G$ to the element $\bar{5}$ in $H$ . Also, since $o(\bar{m})\mid n$ we must have that $n$ is an even number, and since $n\mid 6$ we can only have $n=2$ . The only elements in $S_3$ with order $2$ are the tranpositions $(12),(13),(23)$ . Hence, a non-trivial homomorphism must take some transposition to $\bar{5}$ . Now, it is easy to check that the multiplication of two tranpositions, $\tau_1\neq\tau_2$ is a $3\text{-cycle}$ . Hence: $$\bar{0}=\phi(3\text{-cycle})=\phi(\tau_1\tau_2)=\phi(\tau_1)+\phi(\tau_2)$$ The only way to make this equation work, since $\phi(\tau)=\bar{0},\bar{5}$ is that both $\phi(\tau_1)=\phi(\tau_2)=\bar{5}$ , hence if $\phi$ is a non-trivial homomorphism we must have that $\phi(\tau)=\bar{5}$ for all transpositions $\tau\in S_3$ and $\phi(g)=\bar{0}$ if $g$ is not a tranposition. It is easy to check that this is in fact a homomorphism, and because of the necessity of this conditions, we must have that $\text{Hom}(G,H)=\{\text{ trivial },\phi\}$ . Is there any flaw with my logic? Did I get all possible homomorphisms? Thanks for any help","I want to check if my line of thought is correct. We need to find all homomorphisms .

Aluffi's ""Algebra: Chapter $\it 0$ "" , exercise II. $5.8$ . Still more generally, prove that $F(A\amalg B)=F(A)*F(B)$ and that $F^{ab}(A\amalg B)=F^{ab}(A)\oplus F^{ab}(B)$ for all sets $A,B$ . $($ That is, the constructions $F,F^{ab}$ 'preserve coproducts'. $)$ Here $F(A)$ is the free groups on the set $A$ , $A\amalg B$ is the disjoint union of $A$ and $B$ , and $G*H$ is the free product of $G$ and $H$ (i.e. the coproduct in $\sf Grp$ ). All of those are characterized by their usual universal properties which will be used extensively for the proof. $^*$ Proof. We will show that $F(A\amalg B)$ satisfies the universal property of $F(A)*F(B)$ . For startes, we will construct the (canonical) inclusion homomorphisms. Thus, consider the following diagrams Here $\iota_A,\iota_B,\iota$ are the inclusion of $A,B,A\amalg B$ into their respective free groups. The (unique) group homomorphisms $I_A,I_B$ are induced by considering the compositions $\iota\circ i_B$ and $\iota\circ i_B$ and the universal properties of $F(A)$ and $F(B)$ . Hence they are such that $$I_A\circ\iota_A=\iota\circ i_A,~~~I_B\circ\iota_B=\iota\circ i_B$$ Now, suppose we are given group homomorphisms $g_A\colon F(A)\to G,\,g_B\colon F(B)\to G$ to some arbitrary group $G$ . We can consider them in particular as set-functions and precomposing with $\iota_A$ and $\iota_B$ , respectively, gives us the following The unique map $g$ is given by the universal property of $A\amalg B$ and such that $$g\circ i_A=g_A\circ\iota_A,~~~g\circ i_B=g_B\circ\iota_B$$ Finally, $\overline{g}$ induces a unique map $\overline{f}$ such that by the universal property of $F(A\amalg B)$ and so $\overline{g}\circ\iota=g$ . Composing gives us uniquely determined group homomorphisms $\overline{g}\circ I_A\colon F(A)\to G$ and $\overline{g}\circ I_B\colon F(B)\to G$ factoring through $F(A\amalg B)$ . It remains to show the following $$\overline{g}\circ I_A=g_A,~~~\overline{g}\circ I_B=g_B$$ But using the given commutativity relations we see that $$(\overline{g}\circ I_A)\circ\iota_A=\overline{g}\circ(I_A\circ\iota_A)=\overline{g}\circ(\iota\circ i_A)=(\overline{g}\circ\iota)\circ i_A=g\circ i_A=g_A\circ\iota_A$$ and hence both triangles in the following diagram commute The right triangle corresponds to the fact the by $g_A\circ\iota_A$ universally induced map is $g_A$ itself. But from the left triangles we see that $\overline{f}\circ I_A$ makes the corresponding diagram commute as well and hence $\overline{f}\circ I_A=g_A$ by the uniquesness of the induced map. The same argument, with all $A$ s replaced by $B$ s, yields $\overline{f}\circ I_B=g_B$ .

Here is the free groups on the set , is the disjoint union of and , and is the free product of and (i.e. the coproduct in ). All of those are characterized by their usual universal properties which will be used extensively for the proof. Proof. We will show that satisfies the universal property of . For startes, we will construct the (canonical) inclusion homomorphisms. Thus, consider the following diagrams Here are the inclusion of into their respective free groups. The (unique) group homomorphisms are induced by considering the compositions and and the universal properties of and . Hence they are such that Now, suppose we are given group homomorphisms to some arbitrary group . We can consider them in particular as set-functions and precomposing with and , respectively, gives us the following The unique map is given by the universal property of and such that Finally, induces a unique map such that by the universal property of and so . Composing gives us uniquely determined group homomorphisms and factoring through . It remains to show the following But using the given commutativity relations we see that and hence both triangles in the following diagram commute The right triangle corresponds to the fact the by universally induced map is itself. But from the left triangles we see that makes the corresponding diagram commute as well and hence by the uniquesness of the induced map. The same argument, with all s replaced by s, yields .

Prove that $P \cap Q \neq \{e\}$ . Here is my thinking thus far: We begin by using the Sylow Theorems. Let $|G| = 56 = 2^3 \cdot 7$ . Denote $n_2, n_7$ by the number of $2$ -Sylow subgroups and the number of $7$ -Sylow subgroups, respectively. Then we have $n_2 | 7$ and $n_2 \equiv 1$ (mod $2$ ) and $n_7|8$ and $n_7 \equiv 1$ (mod $7$ ) $\Rightarrow n_2 = 1$ or $7$ and $n_7 = 1$ or $8$ . We note that each of the $2$ -Sylow subgroups has order $8$ . By a simple counting argument of the number of elements in $|G|$ , it's easy to show that $n_2 = 7$ and $n_7 = 8$ is not possible.

I'm struggling now with showing that $n_2 = 7$ and $n_7 = 1$ gives that, for two $2$ -Sylow subgroups $P$ and $Q$ of $G$ , $P \cap Q \neq \{e\}$ . Suppose $P \cap Q = \{e\}$ . Then, by a counting argument, we get $7(7) = 49$ non-identity elements in $G$ coming from the $2$ -Sylow subgroups, and $6(1) = 6$ nonidentity elements in $G$ coming from the unique $7$ -Sylow subgroup. This gives $49 + 6 = 55$ nonidentity elements in $G$ . Plus the identity element in $G$ this gives exactly 56 elements.
