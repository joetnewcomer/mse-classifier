Show that when $\operatorname{Aut}(G)$ is cyclic $G$ is abelian. This doesn't make that much trouble. Denote the center (all commuting elements) with $Z$.

(Exercise 4.6.13 tells us that $Aut(\mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_2) \cong S_3$.) We know that $A_4 \cong (\mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_2) \rtimes_{\alpha} \mathbb Z_3$ Assume that $G$ is a group of order $12$ which has a normal subgroup $H$ of order $4$. Since $3\mid 12$ and is prime, we know that there exists a group of order $3$ in $G$. So we have an extension $f: \mathbb Z_3 \rightarrow G$ with kernel $H$. Since $H$ and $\mathbb Z_3$ are relatively prime, $f$ must be a split extension. Since split extensions are semidirect products, we just need to classify $H \rtimes_{\alpha} \mathbb Z_3$, right? We know that $H \cong \mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_2$ or $\mathbb Z_4$. Case 1: $\mathbb Z_4 \rtimes_{\alpha} \mathbb Z_3$ We have $\alpha: \mathbb Z_3 \rightarrow Aut(\mathbb Z_4) \cong \mathbb Z_3$, and let $\mathbb Z_3 = \langle a \rangle$ $\bullet$ The homomorphism is trivial $\implies$ $\mathbb Z_4 \rtimes_{\alpha} \mathbb Z_3 \cong \mathbb Z_4 \times \mathbb Z_3$. Since both $\mathbb Z_4$ and $\mathbb Z_3$ are abelian, and the action is trivial; $\mathbb Z_3 \times \mathbb Z_3$ must also be abelian. $\bullet$ $\alpha_1 : a \rightarrow a$ $\bullet$ $\alpha_2 : a \rightarrow a^2$ Let $\iota: H \rightarrow H \rtimes_{\alpha} K$, $\iota': H \rightarrow H \rtimes_{\alpha'} K$, $s: K \rightarrow H \rtimes_{\alpha} K$, and $s' : K \rightarrow H \rtimes_{\alpha'} K$ There is a proposition in our textbook that states: Let $\alpha$ and $\alpha'$ be hoomorphisms of K into Aut(H). Then the following conditions are equivalent: $\alpha$ is conjugate to $\alpha' \circ g$, with $g \in Aut(K)$ There is an isomorphism $\phi: H \rtimes_{\alpha} K \rightarrow H \rtimes_{\alpha'} K$ such that $im(\phi \circ \iota) = im \iota'$ and $im(\phi \circ s) = im s'$. there is a commutative diagram (I cannot draw this here but this is on page 116 here ). I'm not sure if I'm using 1. in the proposition correctly, but this is what I said about $\alpha1$ and $\alpha2$: We know that $e\alpha_2e^{-1} = \alpha_1(a)$, so they must be conjugate. Case 2: We need to classify $(\mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_2) \rtimes_{\alpha} \mathbb Z_3$ We have $\alpha: \mathbb Z_3 \rightarrow Aut(\mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_2) \cong S_3$ $\bullet$ If $\alpha$ is trivial, we have $\mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_3 \cong \mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_6$. Since both $\mathbb Z_2$ and $\mathbb Z_6$ are abelian and the action is trivial, $\mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_6$ is also abelian. We know that there are two elements in $S_3$ of order 3: (123) and (132). So the other two homomorphisms must be: $\bullet$ $\beta_1: a \rightarrow (123)$ $\bullet$ $\beta_2: a \rightarrow (132)$. Now I want to show that $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ must be conjugate, but I'm stuck here. My problem is that, in order to use the proposition, I need to have automorphisms , but since I'm using the fact that $S_3 \cong Aut(\mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_2)$, I'm not using automorphisms, I'm just using elements. So something like (for example) $\beta_1(13)$ makes no sense, right? Basically, this was my plan: I was going to show that $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ were conjugate. Since the problem is talking about nonabelian groups, the trivial homomorphisms of both cases don't really matter... since they both give abelian groups, right? So I would then try to prove that $(\mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_2) \rtimes_{\beta_1} Z_3 \cong \mathbb Z_4 \rtimes_{\alpha_1} \mathbb Z_3$, and then I would be done, right?

Since $3\mid 12$ and is prime, we know that there exists a group of order $3$ in $G$. So we have an extension $f: \mathbb Z_3 \rightarrow G$ with kernel $H$. Since $H$ and $\mathbb Z_3$ are relatively prime, $f$ must be a split extension. Since split extensions are semidirect products, we just need to classify $H \rtimes_{\alpha} \mathbb Z_3$, right? We know that $H \cong \mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_2$ or $\mathbb Z_4$. Case 1: $\mathbb Z_4 \rtimes_{\alpha} \mathbb Z_3$ We have $\alpha: \mathbb Z_3 \rightarrow Aut(\mathbb Z_4) \cong \mathbb Z_3$, and let $\mathbb Z_3 = \langle a \rangle$ $\bullet$ The homomorphism is trivial $\implies$ $\mathbb Z_4 \rtimes_{\alpha} \mathbb Z_3 \cong \mathbb Z_4 \times \mathbb Z_3$. Since both $\mathbb Z_4$ and $\mathbb Z_3$ are abelian, and the action is trivial; $\mathbb Z_3 \times \mathbb Z_3$ must also be abelian. $\bullet$ $\alpha_1 : a \rightarrow a$ $\bullet$ $\alpha_2 : a \rightarrow a^2$ Let $\iota: H \rightarrow H \rtimes_{\alpha} K$, $\iota': H \rightarrow H \rtimes_{\alpha'} K$, $s: K \rightarrow H \rtimes_{\alpha} K$, and $s' : K \rightarrow H \rtimes_{\alpha'} K$ There is a proposition in our textbook that states: Let $\alpha$ and $\alpha'$ be hoomorphisms of K into Aut(H). Then the following conditions are equivalent: $\alpha$ is conjugate to $\alpha' \circ g$, with $g \in Aut(K)$ There is an isomorphism $\phi: H \rtimes_{\alpha} K \rightarrow H \rtimes_{\alpha'} K$ such that $im(\phi \circ \iota) = im \iota'$ and $im(\phi \circ s) = im s'$. there is a commutative diagram (I cannot draw this here but this is on page 116 here ). I'm not sure if I'm using 1. in the proposition correctly, but this is what I said about $\alpha1$ and $\alpha2$: We know that $e\alpha_2e^{-1} = \alpha_1(a)$, so they must be conjugate. Case 2: We need to classify $(\mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_2) \rtimes_{\alpha} \mathbb Z_3$ We have $\alpha: \mathbb Z_3 \rightarrow Aut(\mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_2) \cong S_3$ $\bullet$ If $\alpha$ is trivial, we have $\mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_3 \cong \mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_6$. Since both $\mathbb Z_2$ and $\mathbb Z_6$ are abelian and the action is trivial, $\mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_6$ is also abelian. We know that there are two elements in $S_3$ of order 3: (123) and (132). So the other two homomorphisms must be: $\bullet$ $\beta_1: a \rightarrow (123)$ $\bullet$ $\beta_2: a \rightarrow (132)$. Now I want to show that $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ must be conjugate, but I'm stuck here. My problem is that, in order to use the proposition, I need to have automorphisms , but since I'm using the fact that $S_3 \cong Aut(\mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_2)$, I'm not using automorphisms, I'm just using elements. So something like (for example) $\beta_1(13)$ makes no sense, right? Basically, this was my plan: I was going to show that $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ were conjugate. Since the problem is talking about nonabelian groups, the trivial homomorphisms of both cases don't really matter... since they both give abelian groups, right? So I would then try to prove that $(\mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_2) \rtimes_{\beta_1} Z_3 \cong \mathbb Z_4 \rtimes_{\alpha_1} \mathbb Z_3$, and then I would be done, right?

Then $G=\{g_1,...,g_{k1},...,g_{km},...,g_n\}$ acts on $a_0$ will have the orbit $\{a_0,...,a_{k1},...,a_{km},...,a_0\}$ . Then we let $G$ acts on $a_{k1}$ and get the orbit $\{a_1,a_2,...,a_0,a_{k1},...,a_n\}$ . $a_0$ is in it because we have $g_{k1}^{-1}$ and $a_{k1}$ exists because these two orbits have $a_0$ in common $\Rightarrow$ they are the same orbit. Moreover, $g_{k1}$ can't fix $a_{k1}$ therefore $\exists g_{kx}(a_{k1})=a_{k1}$ . This is the furthest I can get. I'm trying to force a contradiction by assuming the negative but got really stuck.

Since the automorphism group of $\mathbb{Z}/5\mathbb{Z}$ is of order 4, which is prime to 315, this would prove that there is a group of order 5 in the center of $G$ . By the Sylow theorems, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups is $\equiv 1\mod{5}$ , and by the orbit-stabilizer theorem, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups must divide $3^2\cdot 7$ , which implies that the number of 5-Sylow subgroups $n_5$ is either 21 or 1. Using the same method, we see that $n_7$ is either 15 or 1 and $n_3$ is either 1 or 7. I at least want to prove that one of the Sylow sugroups is normal.

I' ve been trying to show that $R/I$ serves as an example of a simple ring which is not semisimple.
