0,Effective Uniformization Theorem for the Torus,Effective Uniformization Theorem for the Torus,,"The famous Uniformization Theorem asserts that for any Riemannian metric $g$ on the 2-torus $T^2$ there exists a function $\rho: T^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ and a flat metric $\bar{g}$ on $T^2$ such that \begin{equation*} g=e^{\rho}\bar{g}. \end{equation*} Philosophically my question is the following: If $g$ is ""almost"" a flat metric, can we say that $\rho$ is small? More precisely, does there for every (small) $\delta >0$ exist a constant $c=c(\delta)$ with the following property and so that $c(\delta) \xrightarrow{\delta \to 0} 0$ : Let $g$ be a metric on $T^2$ so that \begin{equation} \mathrm{diam}(T^2,g) \leq 1 \quad \text{and} \quad |K_g| \leq \delta, \end{equation} where $K_g$ is the Gauss curvature w.r.t. the metric $g$ . Then there exists a function $\rho:T^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ with \begin{equation*} |\rho(x)| \leq c(\delta) \quad \text{for all } \, x \in T^2 \end{equation*} so that $\bar{g}:=e^{-\rho}g$ is a flat metric. Equivalently, can we say that the function $\rho$ whose existence is guaranteed by the Uniformization Theorem satsifies $|\rho(x)| \leq c(\delta)$ for all $x \in T^2$ ? Of course the flat metric in the conformal class of $g$ is only defined up to a multiplicative constant, and so $\rho$ is also only defined up to an additive constant. Since the bound $|\rho(x)| \leq c(\delta)$ can not hold if we change $\rho$ by arbitrary constants, there should be a normalizing condition on $\rho$ . In my opinion any of the following is a natural condition: Choose the flat metric $\bar{g}$ in the conformal class of $g$ so that the corresponding $\rho$ satisfies one of the following conditions: \begin{equation} \int_{T^2}\rho \, d\mathrm{vol}_{\bar{g}}=0, \quad \frac{1}{\mathrm{vol}_{\bar{g}}(T^2)}\int_{T^2}e^{\rho} \, d\mathrm{vol}_{\bar{g}}=1 \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{1}{\mathrm{vol}_{\bar{g}}(T^2)}\int_{T^2}e^{-\rho} \, d\mathrm{vol}_{\bar{g}}=1. \end{equation} I tried proving this by obtaining PDE estimates. For this I needed the fact that for any flat metric $\bar{g}$ on $T^2$ and any $\rho:T^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ it holds \begin{equation} e^{-\rho}\Delta\rho=-2K_g, \end{equation} where $K_g$ is the Gauss curvature of the metric $g:=e^{\rho}\bar{g}$ and $\Delta$ is the Laplace operator of the flat metric $\bar{g}$ . Assuming the last of the three normalizing conditions above  I was able to prove an estimate \begin{equation} e^{-\rho}-1 \leq c(\delta). \end{equation} However, I was unable to prove a lower estimate $e^{-\rho}-1 \geq -c(\delta)$ . I would greatly appreciate an outline of how to prove it (or maybe have an idea what might work) or a reference in the literature stating this.

In order to make it easy I skip the details of the definition and go directly to the part that I don't quite understand.

2,Higher covariant derivatives and the exterior derivative,Higher covariant derivatives and the exterior derivative,,"Let me start with the following tl;dr version of my question What is a higher-order derivative, in general? How does it relate to the exterior   derivative and to differential forms? Suppose we have a bundle and a section $E \overset{\sigma}{\underset{\pi}{\leftrightarrows}} M$ . Assume we have a connection on $E$ . (One of the links assumes we   also have a connection on $\tau^*M$ ; assume that also, if you like.) It seems The $k$ th order derivative should be a bundle map $\bigoplus_{i=0}^k \otimes^i \tau M \to E$ over M. Perhaps it always will satisfy some condition (such as symmetry) that will allow us to pass to a quotient of $\bigoplus_{i=0}^k \otimes^i \tau M$ . The covariant derivative should take us from $k$ th order derivatives to $k+1$ st order derivatives. It should be multilinear in the entries. Regarding the last bullet, I could believe that the higher-order derivative might not always be found by an iterated derivative . Like in calculus where we have to recognize that a multidimensional integral isn't the same as an iterated integral, and under nice circumstances, they are equivalent. One suggestion is that a higher covariant derivative of a section $\sigma: M \to E$ is the prolongation $E \to J^k E$ induced by $\sigma$ . This answer gives an outline of what I'm looking for, but it does so in quite a vague way. This answer seems to be addressing the issue head-on, but I haven't a clue what he's doing with his notation. See also this question about higher covariant derivatives. This is maybe how an explanation could proceed: A higher-order covariant derivative $\nabla^k s$ of a section of a vector bundle $E \to M$ should be the prolongation $E \to J^k E$ of the $k$ th jet bundle $J^kE \to E$ . Sections of $J^kE \to E$ are elements of $\Gamma \left( \left( \bigoplus\limits_{i=0}^k\operatorname{Sym}^i \tau^* M \right) \otimes E \right)$ . So we can think of them like ""polynomials of degree $\leq k$ where we plug in tangent vectors and get out elements of $E$ ."" This maps nicely onto Taylor polynomials and $k$ th order approximations of a function. The anti-symmetry of the exterior derivative (alternately, the anti-symmetry of the wedge product) kills all but the first-order derivatives. (Becoming a little vague. This is what the first link above says, but does not explain.) (How can we make the last bullet rigorous? One relevant fact is that if $V$ is a vector space, and we view the symmetric and anti-symmetric tensors of order $k$ as subgroups of $\otimes ^kV$ (really they are quotients), then $\operatorname{Alt}^kV \cap \operatorname{Sym}^k V = 0$ except when $k=1$ .) We'd like to say something like The usual exterior derivative $d: \wedge^k \tau^*M \to \wedge^{k+1} \tau^*M$ or $d: \wedge^k \tau^*M \otimes E \to \wedge^{k+1} \tau^*M \otimes E$ somehow only captures one level at a time(?) of what the higher derivatives do? We also like anti-symmetry for modeling a ""volume of a parallelipiped""-type function which is multilinear and vanishes when there are collinear entries (like the determinant). And we like the exterior derivative for being dual to the boundary in Stokes' theorem. Hence we extract this information in differential geometry. This morning I've been boring through the ""Natural Operations..."" book by Kolar et al, but boy...it's encyclopedic, and has quite esoteric notation to boot. Kolar claims he's outlined what a higher-order derivative should be in generality, in an article called "" On the Absolute Differentiation of  Geometric Object Fields "" from 1973.

I've computed the geodesic equations of $g$ ($\gamma_1$ is the component of $\gamma$ in the coordinate $x$ and so on): $$\ddot\gamma_1=\displaystyle{\frac{2y\dot\gamma_1\dot\gamma_2+x(\dot\gamma_1^2-\dot\gamma_2^2-\dot\gamma_3^2)}{x^2+y^2}}$$ $$\ddot\gamma_2=\displaystyle{\frac{2x\dot\gamma_1\dot\gamma_2-y(\dot\gamma_1^2-\dot\gamma_2^2+\dot\gamma_3^2)}{x^2+y^2}}$$ $$\ddot\gamma_3=\displaystyle{\frac{2(x\dot\gamma_1+y\dot\gamma_2)\dot\gamma_3}{x^2+y^2}}$$ But I don't know how to integrate these differential equations to get the equation of the geodesic from $p_1$ to $p_2$ and then compute its length.",,['differential-geometry']

16,Smooth tiling of the plane,Smooth tiling of the plane,,"For my master thesis, I solved a PDE under the assumption of the domain being smooth and small. I wanted to patch these domains and solutions somehow together, hoping that I can get a global result. With that in mind, I asked myself, whether one can tile the plane using bounded domains with smooth boundary. By tiling, I mean a family of closed sets covering the entire plane, such that the interiours are pairwise disjoint. My reasonable assumptions on the sets are, that they should be closed domains, with a uniform bound on the diameter, having a smooth boundary and the family needs to be locally finite. It seems impossible to me, if one restricts to locally finite tilings, since when two adjacent boundaries separate, they always leave a cusp, which can’t be filled by a smooth and locally finite tiling. Does anyone have a clue if such a smooth tilings can exist or if they have a name? Maybe I missed something, but I think the cusps are inevitable. Edit 1: here are the reasons for my assumptions: If one removes one of the assumptions (smooth boundary, uniformly bounded and locally finite) without smooth boundary, one can take for example a square grid tiling the plane without boundedness, one could take two half planes. Without a uniform bound on the diameter, one could take concentric rings which tile the plane. without the local finiteness, one could use a Vitali-like covering using balls. Edit 2: My sketch of the proof, that it is impossible to tile the plane with these sets goes as follows. Assume such a tiling exists. If two adjacent sets touch, then the touching boundaries either seperate at some point, or the sets share a connected component of their boundaries. If they seperate, one sees by local graph description of the sets, that he have a cusp, which can’t be filled by a single smoothly bounded set (maybe by a sequence of domains,but that is against the local finiteness). Therefore,  sets that share a point at their boundary must actually share the entire connected component of the boundary. For each set $A$ , there is some set $B$ that touches the most outer boundary enclosing the set $A$ and must therefore share this outermost connected component. This makes it, so that $B$ has strictly larger diameter, since $A$ is surrounded by $B$ . This process continues for the outermost boundary of $B$ and if we use the local finiteness, one can continue arbitrary often to find that the sets have unbounded diameter. This is a contradiction to the hypothesis, that such a tiling exists.","For my master thesis, I solved a PDE under the assumption of the domain being smooth and small.

Edit 1: here are the reasons for my assumptions: If one removes one of the assumptions (smooth boundary, uniformly bounded and locally finite) without smooth boundary, one can take for example a square grid tiling the plane without boundedness, one could take two half planes. Without a uniform bound on the diameter, one could take concentric rings which tile the plane. without the local finiteness, one could use a Vitali-like covering using balls. Edit 2: My sketch of the proof, that it is impossible to tile the plane with these sets goes as follows. Assume such a tiling exists. If two adjacent sets touch, then the touching boundaries either seperate at some point, or the sets share a connected component of their boundaries. If they seperate, one sees by local graph description of the sets, that he have a cusp, which can’t be filled by a single smoothly bounded set (maybe by a sequence of domains,but that is against the local finiteness). Therefore,  sets that share a point at their boundary must actually share the entire connected component of the boundary. For each set , there is some set that touches the most outer boundary enclosing the set and must therefore share this outermost connected component. This makes it, so that has strictly larger diameter, since is surrounded by . This process continues for the outermost boundary of and if we use the local finiteness, one can continue arbitrary often to find that the sets have unbounded diameter. This is a contradiction to the hypothesis, that such a tiling exists.",A B A B A B B,"['differential-geometry', 'partial-differential-equations', 'euclidean-geometry', 'tiling']"

26,"Rigorous version of ""spatial infinity is a point and not a sphere""","Rigorous version of ""spatial infinity is a point and not a sphere""",,"This is a question on differential geometry/topology of Lorentzian manifolds. It is motivated by Physics, but since I want a mathematicaly rigorous formulation I think the correct place to ask is here. So let us state the problem: Let Minkowski spacetime $(\mathbb{R}^4,\eta)$ be given with metric tensor $(\eta_{\mu\nu}) = \operatorname{diag}(-1,1,1,1)$ . We want to talk about infinity as a place . So we want a bigger spacetime $(M,g)$ properly containing Minkowski spacetime and such that the boundary of Minkowski spacetime on this bigger manifold can be seen as the ""points at infinity"". It turns out that one can discover that the right way to do this and have a correct picture of infinity is to require that the embedding of Minkowski spacetime on the bigger manifold be conformal. So far so good. So what we do in practice is: Introduce null spherical coordinates $u =t-r$ and $v = t+r$ with ranges $-\infty < u,v < +\infty$ and $u\leq v$ so that the metric tensor becomes $$\eta=-dudv+\frac{1}{4}(v-u)^2(d\theta^2+\sin^2\theta d\phi^2).$$ Compactify along these by defining $u = \tan U$ and $v = \tan V$ with ranges $-\pi/2 < U,V < \pi/2$ and $U\leq V$ so that the metric in these coordinates becomes $$\eta=\dfrac{1}{\cos^2 U\cos^2 V}(-dUdV+\frac{1}{4}\sin^2(U-V)(d\theta^2+\sin^2\theta d\phi^2))$$ Up to this point the coordinates $(U,V,\theta,\phi)$ with the ranges described in (2) together with the above metric, is just an awkward reparametrization of Minowski spacetime. What we want to do is to precisely describe the points $(U,V,\theta,\phi)$ with $U = \pm \pi/2$ or $V = \pm \pi/2$ . These comprise the desired boundary . It is also clear that if we find a bigger manifold $(N,g)$ with the metric in parenthesis, Minkowski spacetime can be conformally mapped to one open region of it. We now turn to the description of the bigger manifold. The obvious thing to do is to allow the coordinates $U,V$ to extend further . In other words, the naive idea would be: *well, define $$g = -dUdV+\frac{1}{4}\sin^2(U-V)(d\theta^2+\sin^2\theta d\phi^2)$$ and then allow $U,V$ to run from $-\infty$ to $\infty$ together with the usual $(\theta,\phi)\in S^2$ to describe $(N,g)$ . Here comes the trouble. Proceeding naively like this, it seems to be no reason that $(-\pi/2,\pi/2,\theta,\phi)$ is not a sphere. It turns out that Roger Penrose states in an old work from 1964 that ""because $\sin(U-V)=0$ on the metric in these coordinates, they all represent the same point. The coordinate system $(U,V,\theta,\phi)$ looses injectivity if we go to $U = -V = -\pi/2$ . He says this is exactly the same as the $r = 0$ in polar coordinates in the plane. In other words: the metric places a constraint that the bigger manifold is such that the points with coordinates $(-\pi/2,\pi/2,\theta,\phi)$ are all the same point. Now, I really have thought hard about that, but I fail to grasp the reasoning in (5). I mean, we in that case we do have the manifold $\mathbb{R}^2$ explicit and we see that the coordinate chart we propose geometricaly is not injective if we include the origin. Here we don't have the manifold. All we have are coordinates and a metric and from this we want to find a manifold with this metric and with these coordinates containing properly the piece we already have. The fact that the $S^2$ part of the metric vanishes there seems to imply the extension is so that points which naively are $S^2$ are actually the same point. Now why is that? How to understand this?

Olivier  Begassat gave a nice answer which uses a clever idea endowing the vector space with an inner product. There were other interesting answers too. I now have a more basic proof of the same statement which I would like to share. I hope this will be useful to the reader. Definition. Let $V$ be an $n$-dimensional vector space. A $k$- frame in $V$ is an injective linear transformation $T:\R^k\to V$. The set of all the $k$-frames of $V$ is written as $F_k(V)$. It is clear that $F_k(V)$ is an open subset of $\mc L(\R^k, V)$ and is therefore a $kn$-dimensional manifold. We define an equivalence relation $\sim$ on $F_k(V)$ as follows: Given two $k$-frames $S$ and $T$ in $V$, we write $S\sim T$ if and only if $T(\R^k)=S(\R^k)$. It is clear that $\sim$ is an equivalence relation on $F_k(V)$. Note that $T\sim S$ for $T, S\in F_k(V)$ if and only if there exists $\tau\in \GL_k(\R)$ such that $S=T\circ \tau$. Definition. We define the Grassmannian manifold $\grassman_k(V)$ as the quotient space $F_k(V)/\sim$. Remark. Note that $\R^k$ is in no way special here. We could have chosen any $k$ dimensional linear space. It can be easily seen that the Grassmannian remains undisturbed either as a set or a topological space under this change. We will make use of this flexibility shortly. We now set out to prove that the Grassmannian manifold is Hausdorff. We require some ground work to do that. Define $\pi:F_k(V)\to\grassman_k(V)$ as the projection map, that is, $\pi$ carries $T$ to the equivalence class of $T$ Theorem 1. The projection map $\pi:F_k(V)\to \grassman_k(V)$ as defined above is an open map. Proof. Let $U$ be open in $F_k(V)$. We need to show that $\pi(U)$ is open in $\grassman_k(V)$, for which we need to show that $\pi^{-1}(\pi(U))$ is open. Let $T\in \pi^{-1}(\pi(U))$. Thus $\pi(T)\in \pi(U)$, which is equivalent to saying that $T=S\circ \tau$ for some $S\in U$ and $\tau\in \GL_k(\R)$. Define a map $f_\tau:F_k(V)\to F_k(V)$ as $f_\tau(L)=L\circ \tau$ for all $L \in F_k(V)$. learly $f_\tau$ is continuous with $f_{\tau^{-1}}$ being a continuous inverse to it. Therefore, $f_\tau$ is a homeomorphism, and we deduce that $f_\tau(U)$ is open in $F_k(V)$. Now we have $T\in f_\tau(U)$ and $f_\tau(U)\subseteq \pi^{-1}(\pi(U))$, showing that $\pi^{-1}(\pi(U))$ is open, and consequently $\pi$ is an open map. For any given $(n-k)$-dimensional subspace $A$ of $V$, let $\mc U_A$ denote the set of all the $k$-dimensional subspaces of $V$ which intersect $A$ trivially. Thus for any member $B\in \mc U_A$, we have $V=A\oplus B$. Lemma 2. Given an $(n-k)$-dimensional subspace of $V$, the set $\mc U_A$ is open in $\grassman_k(V)$. Proof. Write $m=n-k$ and fix a basis $u_1 , \ldots, u_m$ of $A$. For a member $T\in F_k(V)$, $\pi(T)$ intersects $A$ trivially if and only if $(u_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge u_m)\wedge(T\mathbf e_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge T\mathbf e_k)\neq 0$. So we define a function $f:F_k(V)\to \Lambda^k V$ as \begin{equation*} f(T) = (u_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge u_m)\wedge(T\mathbf e_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge T\mathbf e_k)\neq 0 \end{equation*} Thus $\pi(T)\in \mc U_A$ if and only if $f(T)\neq 0$ if and only if $T\in f^{-1}(\Lambda^k V-\set{0})$. herefore,  \begin{equation*} \mc U_A=\textstyle\pi(f^{-1}(\Lambda^k V-\set{0})) \end{equation*} Now $f$ is continuous (smooth, even) because it is a restriction of a linear map on $\mc L(\R^k, V)$ to the open subset $F_k(V)$ of $\mc L(\R^k, V)$ Using the fact that $\pi:F_k(V)\to \grassman_k(V)$ is open, we see that $\mc U_A$ is open in $\grassman_k(V)$. Definition. Let $P$ and $Q$ be $k$ and $n-k$ dimensional subspaces of $V$ respectively such that $V=P\oplus Q$. Given any linear map $T:P\to Q$, the graph $\Gamma(T)$ of $T$ is defined as  $$ 	\Gamma(T)=\set{x+Tx:\ x\in P} $$ Lemma 3. Let $A$ be an $(n-k)$-dimensional subspace of $V$ and $B$ be a $k$-dimensional subspace of $V$ which intersects $A$ trivially. Then $\mc U_A$ is homeomorphic to $\mc L(B, A)$. Proof. To prove this, we think of frames as injective linear maps from $B$ to $V$. Let $p_{A, B}:V\to A$ be the projection onto $A$ with respect to $B$ and similarly we have $p_{B, A}$. Note that for any $T\in \pi^{-1}(\mc U_A)$, we have $p_{B, A}\circ T:B\to B$ is a linear isomorphism. Define a function $\Phi:\pi^{-1}(\mc U_A)\to \mc L(B, A)$ as $\Phi(T)=\Phi_T$, where the latter is defined as \begin{equation*} \Phi_T(x) = (p_{A, B}\circ T)\circ (p_{B, A}\circ T)^{-1}(x) \end{equation*} for all $x\in B$. It can be shown that $\Phi_T=\Phi_S$ if and only if $\pi(T)=\pi(S)$ and that $\Phi$ is surjective. Since $\pi$ is a quotient map, we get a bijective continuous map $\bar\Phi:\mc U_A\to \mc L(B, A)$ such that the following diagram commutes We now show that $\bar \Phi$ is a homeomorphism by constructing an inverse. Define $g:\mc L(B, A)\to \mc U_A$ as $g(S)=\Gamma(S)$, that is, $g$ takes $S$ to its graph in $V$. Let $B'\in \mc U_A$ be arbitrary and let $T:B\to V$ be defined as the restriction of $p_{B', A}:V\to B'$ to $B$. Then it is easy to check that $\pi(T)=B'$ and thus $T\in \pi^{-1}(\mc U_A)$. Therefore $\bar \Phi(B')=\Phi(T)$ and it can be easily checked that $\Gamma(\Phi(T))=B'$, showing that $g\circ \bar\Phi=\id$ and we are done. Theorem 4. The Grassmannian $\grassman_k(V)$ is Hausdorff. Proof. Let $B$ and $B'$ be any two distinct members of $\grassman_k(V)$.

38,resonance in pde,resonance in pde,,"(I migrated the question from overflow b/c I think it belongs here instead.) About a year back I was in Professor Henry Mckean's office and he told me alot of interesting things.  One thing he told me was that if a  pde has resonances then often the resonances dissapear when the same pde is taken on a natural compactification of the space.  Unfortunately at 85 years old he is not in great health anymore and I can't ask him directly what he meant. One example he gave me is that the transformed pde of burgers equation into the heat equation has resonances but when the same pde is taken in $\mathbb{RP^1}=\mathbb{S^1}$, a compactification of $\mathbb{R}$, the resonances dissapear.  He told me that this makes sense because the cole hopf transformation is nonlinear transformation so the resulting pde should have resonances.

About a year back I was in Professor Henry Mckean's office and he told me alot of interesting things.  One thing he told me was that if a  pde has resonances then often the resonances dissapear when the same pde is taken on a natural compactification of the space.  Unfortunately at 85 years old he is not in great health anymore and I can't ask him directly what he meant. One example he gave me is that the transformed pde of burgers equation into the heat equation has resonances but when the same pde is taken in $\mathbb{RP^1}=\mathbb{S^1}$, a compactification of $\mathbb{R}$, the resonances dissapear.  He told me that this makes sense because the cole hopf transformation is nonlinear transformation so the resulting pde should have resonances.

At this point I thought that an inhabitant on this 2D manifold cannot feel accelerations pointing towards the extra-dimensions, only the projections of it.  So I projected these vectors into the tangent space and I got this: $$ \frac{d^2 x^i}{dt^2} + \Gamma^i_{jk} \frac{d x^j}{dt} \frac{dx^k}{dt} $$ For latitude circles it's a vector pointing north (on the northern hemisphere).- It makes sense to me, as latitude circles keeps turning northward.

Perhaps it is better explained in Mathematics text, but I haven't taken a look at them. The volume form in general relativity is introduced through something called a tensor density. As far as I understand, tensor densities aren't really much different from tensors - they just come from looking at tensors differently. When physicists mean the form $dx^1 \wedge dx^2 \wedge ...\wedge dx^n$ is a tensor density what they mean is that in a new coordinate system $y^\alpha$ , the form becomes $J dy^1 \wedge dy^2 \wedge ... \wedge dy^n$ where $J$ is the Jacobian determinant. However, the n-form is actually a tensor; the only reason it picks up the factor of the Jacobian is because we represent the tensor in terms of wedge products and not tensor products. We multiply the the square root of the metric to compensate for this factor. I understand this fairly well. However, is the final volume form given by $\sqrt{-g} \text{ } dx^1 \wedge dx^2 \wedge ...\wedge dx^n$ a tensor?
