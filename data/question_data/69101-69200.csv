8,Visualising $\mathbb CP^2$: a problem of attaching cells with a dimension gap >1,Visualising : a problem of attaching cells with a dimension gap >1,\mathbb CP^2,"For the uninitiated Morse theory , as many other early algebraic-topology widgets, leads to a picture of smooth manifolds as being built up from 'cells', copies of $\mathbb{D}^n$ for varying $n$ , 'glued' to each other by the usual topological tools; giving rise to (in some sense) a more natural picture of homology as 'coming from' cellular homology . Example As an example, consider the torus $\mathbb{T}^2$ : we begin with empty space, attach a 0-cell ( $\mathbb{D}^0=$ a point), attach a 1-cell ( $\mathbb{D}^1=$ a line) to your point (both ends of the line are attached to the point, creating a circle), attach another 1-cell (in the same way, to the same point, creating a sort of figure 8). The hardest bit to visualise is next: attaching a 2-cell ( $\mathbb{D}^2=$ a disk, which we will think of as its homeomorphism equivalent, a square). Begin by twisting your figure 8 so that one circle is in the xy-plane, the other in the xz-plane, now attach the top and bottom of your square (coloured red in picture below) to the xy circle (creating a 'curling round' tube) and the left and right edges (coloured blue below) of your square (now a tube) either side of the xz circle, completing the torus. Problem The above takes some thinking, but a little reading around shows that this is fairly easy to see. What makes it so easy is that the cells we are attaching are of adjacent dimensions , that is; we may easily identify the boundary of one with the entirety of another. Where it gets harder to visualise is when the dimensions of the cells we are attaching to one another differ by >1- the canonical example of this is the complex projective plane $\mathbb{CP}^2$ , a 4-manifold built by attaching a disk to a point (making a sphere) and then attaching a 4-ball to that sphere. The latter attaching map (wherein points are identified with their images), I know, may be thought of as the Hopf fibration $\partial \mathbb{D}^4=S^3 \to \mathbb{CP}^1=S^2 $ , but I have no way of visualising this, particularly with regard to the interior of the 4-disk. How does a 4 cell wrap around a 2 cell without producing a singularity of some kind? Is this analagous in some sense to Dehn surgery in which one uses a thickening? Is there a right way to think about this or can it only really be thought of 'intellectually'?","For the uninitiated Morse theory , as many other early algebraic-topology widgets, leads to a picture of smooth manifolds as being built up from 'cells', copies of for varying , 'glued' to each other by the usual topological tools; giving rise to (in some sense) a more natural picture of homology as 'coming from' cellular homology .

59,Is a function which preserves zero and affine lines necessarily linear?,Is a function which preserves zero and affine lines necessarily linear?,,"My question is directly inspired by this other recent question , but I was trying to figure out whether or not it holds for $\mathbb R$. This led me to two questions. Let $n \ge 2$ be an integer (we're not including $n = 1$ as there are trivial counterexamples in dimension $1$). Let $V$ and $W$ be real vector spaces, both of dimension $n$, and let $f: V \to W$ be a bijection which sends zero to zero and affine lines to affine lines. Is $f$ necessarily linear? Let $V$ be a real vector space of dimension $n$. If we forget the vector space structure on $V$, and remember only the data of what the affine lines in $V$ are and $n$, can we recover the topology on $V$? An affirmative to question 1 implies an affirmative to question 2: Simply choose any bijection $f: V \to \mathbb R^n$ which preserves affine lines, and $f$ is necessarily a homeomorphism. In dimension $n=2$, question $2$ is equivalent to the following problem: Using only the data of what the affine lines are, given $3$ distinct parallel lines (which can be characterized as those which don't intersect with each other), determine which line is in the middle. Once you know that, you can describe open sets in terms of the unions of lines between two parallel lines.

It would also be good to know whether, and how, the answers to 1 and 2 depend on the dimension of $V$.","My question is directly inspired by this other recent question , but I was trying to figure out whether or not it holds for $\mathbb R$. This led me to two questions. Let $n \ge 2$ be an integer (we're not including $n = 1$ as there are trivial counterexamples in dimension $1$). Let $V$ and $W$ be real vector spaces, both of dimension $n$, and let $f: V \to W$ be a bijection which sends zero to zero and affine lines to affine lines. Is $f$ necessarily linear? Let $V$ be a real vector space of dimension $n$. If we forget the vector space structure on $V$, and remember only the data of what the affine lines in $V$ are and $n$, can we recover the topology on $V$? An affirmative to question 1 implies an affirmative to question 2: Simply choose any bijection $f: V \to \mathbb R^n$ which preserves affine lines, and $f$ is necessarily a homeomorphism. In dimension $n=2$, question $2$ is equivalent to the following problem: Using only the data of what the affine lines are, given $3$ distinct parallel lines (which can be characterized as those which don't intersect with each other), determine which line is in the middle. Once you know that, you can describe open sets in terms of the unions of lines between two parallel lines.

But, the order topology on $Y$ agrees with the subspace topology on $Y$, so this particular $X$ is indeed homeomorphic to a subspace of $\mathbb{R}$. Example: Let $X$ equal the set of endpoints of the Cantor set. The order on $X$ is a bit strange (it's order isomorphic to $\mathbb{Q} \times \{0,1\}$ in the dictionary order with a largest and smallest element adjoined), so one might expect the order topology on $X$ to be strange, but... $X$ is clearly 2nd countable under the order topology (there are countably many points, hence countably many intervals) and any order topology is regular, so $X$ is metrizeable by Urysohn. It is also easy to see the order topology on $X$ has no isolated points so, by a theorem of Sierpinski (any countable metric space without isolated points is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{Q}$), the order topology on $X$ is homeomorphic to the subspace $Y = \mathbb{Q}$ of $\mathbb{R}$. For any countable $X$, the argument above shows the order topology on $X$ is metrizeable. In fact, I think the order topology on any $X \subset \mathbb{R}$ is metrizeable by this theorem of Lusin (an order topology $X$ is metrizeable if and only if the diagonal in $X \times X$ is a $G_\delta$ set). But this doesn't preclude the possiblity of $X$ weird enough to not be homeomorphic to any subspace of $\mathbb{R}$. I'm not sure how one would arrange this though. If it can be arranged with $X$ countable there would need to be many isolated points to avoid Sierpinski's result for instance...

Then there is an order isomorphism (hence homeomorphism of order topologies) $\varphi$ from $X$ to a new set $Y \subset \mathbb{R}$ whose order topology and subspace topology coincide. Roughly, approach is to take countable set $D \subset X$ such that each point in $X \setminus D$ is a 2-sided limit (topologically) of points in $D$. Using countability of $D$, one can find an order embedding $\varphi$ of $D$ into $\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\varphi(D)$ has no ""topological gaps"" that are not also ""order gaps"" (this is the property which makes the subspace and order topologies coincide).

In fact, I think the order topology on any $X \subset \mathbb{R}$ is metrizeable by this theorem of Lusin (an order topology $X$ is metrizeable if and only if the diagonal in $X \times X$ is a $G_\delta$ set). But this doesn't preclude the possiblity of $X$ weird enough to not be homeomorphic to any subspace of $\mathbb{R}$. I'm not sure how one would arrange this though. If it can be arranged with $X$ countable there would need to be many isolated points to avoid Sierpinski's result for instance... Advertisement: Brian's positive answer below actually proves something even better. Namely: Theorem: Let $X \subset \mathbb{R}$. Then there is an order isomorphism (hence homeomorphism of order topologies) $\varphi$ from $X$ to a new set $Y \subset \mathbb{R}$ whose order topology and subspace topology coincide. Roughly, approach is to take countable set $D \subset X$ such that each point in $X \setminus D$ is a 2-sided limit (topologically) of points in $D$. Using countability of $D$, one can find an order embedding $\varphi$ of $D$ into $\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\varphi(D)$ has no ""topological gaps"" that are not also ""order gaps"" (this is the property which makes the subspace and order topologies coincide). The final step is to extend $\varphi$ to the rest of $X$ and check nothing goes awry in doing so.",,"['general-topology', 'order-theory']"
70,A five-part problem that uses ends and the Cantor set to prove that there are $c$ non-homeomorphic connected open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^2$,A five-part problem that uses ends and the Cantor set to prove that there are  non-homeomorphic connected open subsets of,c \mathbb{R}^2,"My question comes from Spivak's ""Comprehensive Introduction to Differential Geometry Vol 1"" (It's Chapter 1, Problem 24). Background : Let $X$ be a connected, locally connected, locally compact, and hemicompact Hausdorff space. And end of $X$ is defined to be a function $e$ that assigns to each compact set $C$ of $X$ a connected component of $X-C$, in such a way that if $C \subset D$, then $e(D) \subset e(C)$. Let $E(X)$ be the set of all ends of X. In a previous problem, I've shown that the set $X \cup E(X)$ can be given a topology with basis elements being the open sets of X together with sets $N(C,e)=e(C) \cup \{f\in E(X) | e(C)=f(C)\}$ for each end $e$ and compact set $C$.

I'd like to find a proof of b,d, and e . I think I have a solution for a and c, described further below. a) Show that it is possible for $\mathbb{R}^2-A$ and $\mathbb{R}^2-B$ to be homeomorphic even though $A$ and $B$ are non-homeomorphic closed subsets. b) If $A \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ is closed and totally disconnected, then $E(\mathbb{R}^2-A)$ is homeomorphic to $A$. Hence if $A$ and $B$ are non-homeomorphic totally disconnected closed subsets, $\mathbb{R}^2-A$ and $\mathbb{R}^2-B$ are non-homeomorphic. c) The derived set $A'$ of a set $A$ is defined to be the set of non-isolated points of $A$. Show that for each $n$, there is a subset $A_n$ of $\mathbb{R}$ such that the $n$'th derived set ${A_n}^{(n)}$ of $A_n$ consists of a single point. d) There are $c$ non-homeomorphic closed, totally disconnected subsets of $\mathbb{R}^2$.(Hint: Let $C$ be the cantor set, and $c_1<c_2<c_3\ldots$ a sequence of points in $C$.

For part c , I think that we can take the $1/n$ sequence (and 0) and add smaller such sequences that converge to each of the points of the original. This can be done recursively. For part b , I have a feeling that the statement of the problem should be to prove that $E(\mathbb{R}^2-A)$ is homeomorphic to the one-point compactification of $A$ (call it $\tilde{A}$). (The reason I think this is because $A$ might not be compact, but $E(\mathbb{R}^2-A)$ always is. Using the one-point compactification should also take care of the unbounded end.) I think the idea is to define a function $\tilde{A}\to E(\mathbb{R}^2-A)$ that takes a point $a$ to an end $e$ defined by $e(C)$= the component of $\mathbb{R}^2-A-C$ whose closure in $\mathbb{R}^2$ contains $a$, and takes $\infty$ to the end $e$ defined by $e(C)=$the unique unbounded component of $\mathbb{R}^2-A-C$ (I'm not sure why there's a unique one, but it feels like removing a closed totally disconnected set from a connected open set should leave a connected open set). But I couldn't prove that this function is well-defined, much less bijective, continuous, or open. If my guess about the one-point compactification in right, this may mess up the ""hence"" part of b, since I remember reading somehere that it's possible for two non-homeomorphic spaces to have isomorphic one-point compactifications.

Munkres, 2nd edition: Consider $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ in the uniform topology. Show that $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ lie in the same component of $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ if and only if the sequence $$ \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y} = \left( x_1 - y_1, x_2 - y_2, \ldots \right) $$    is bounded. [ Hint: It suffices to consider the case where $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{0}$.] My Attempt: First of all, we note that $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ denotes the set of all the (infinite) sequences of real numbers; that is, $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ denotes the countably infinite Cartesian product    $$ \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \times \cdots. $$ And, the uniform topology on $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ is the one induced by the so-called uniform metric on $\mathbb{R}^\omega$, which is given by    $$ \bar{\rho}( \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} ) \colon= \sup \left\{ \ \min \left\{ \ \left\lvert x_n - y_n \right\rvert, 1 \ \right\} \ \colon \ n \in \mathbb{N} \ \right\} $$   for all $\mathbf{x} \colon= \left( x_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ and $\mathbf{y} \colon= \left( y_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ in $\mathbb{R}^\omega$. Now let $\mathbf{a} \colon= \left( a_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ and $\mathbf{b} \colon= \left( b_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be any two points in $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ such that the sequence $$ \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} = \left( a_n - b_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$$   is bounded, that is, such that there exists a positive real number $r$ such that    $$ \left\lvert a_n - b_n \right\rvert \leq r \ \mbox{ for all } \ n \in \mathbb{N}. \tag{1} $$   Now let $f \colon [ 0, 1 ] \to \mathbb{R}^\omega$ be the map defined by    $$ f(t) \colon= \mathbf{a} + t(\mathbf{b}- \mathbf{a} ) = \big( a_n + t \left( b_n - a_n \right) \big)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \ \mbox{ for all } \ t \in [0, 1].  $$   Then for any points $s, t \in [0, 1]$, we note that    $$ \begin{align} \bar{\rho}( f(s), f(t) ) &= \sup \left\{ \ \min \left\{ \ \big\lvert \big( a_n + s \left( b_n - a_n \right) \big) - \big( a_n + t \left( b_n - a_n \right) \big)  \big\rvert, \, 1 \ \right\} \ \colon \ n \in \mathbb{N} \ \right\} \\ &= \sup \left\{ \ \min \left\{ \ \lvert s-t \rvert \cdot \left\lvert b_n - a_n \right\rvert, \, 1 \ \right\} \ \colon \ n \in \mathbb{N} \ \right\} \\ &\leq \sup \left\{ \ \lvert s-t \rvert \cdot \left\lvert b_n - a_n \right\rvert \colon \ n \in \mathbb{N} \ \right\} \\ &= \lvert s-t \rvert \cdot \sup \left\{ \ \left\lvert b_n - a_n \right\rvert \colon \ n \in \mathbb{N} \ \right\} \\ &\leq \lvert s-t \rvert r \qquad \mbox{ [ using (1) above ]}. \end{align}  $$   So, given any real number $\varepsilon > 0$, if we choose our real number $\delta$ such that $$ 0 < \delta < \frac{\varepsilon}{r}, $$   then we find that    $$ \bar{\rho}( f(s), f(t) ) < \varepsilon $$   holds for any pair of points $s, t \in [0, 1]$ for which $$ \lvert s-t \rvert < \delta. $$   Thus the map $f$ is continuous (in fact uniformly continuous). Moreover, $f(0) = \mathbf{a}$ and $f(1) = \mathbf{b}$. Therefore $f$ is a path in the uniform space $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ joining the points $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$. So $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ lie in the same path component of $\mathbb{R}^\omega$. And since each path component of any topological space is contained in a component of that space, we can conclude that $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ lie in the same component of $\mathbb{R}^\omega$. Am I right? Can we give an independent proof of the above without having recourse to path components? Now suppose that the sequence $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$ is unbounded. Then, for any natural number $k$, there exists a natural number $n_k$ such that    $$ \left\lvert a_{n_k} - b_{n_k} \right\rvert > k. $$ Now let $U$ be the set of all the points $\mathbf{x} \colon= \left( x_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ in $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ such that the sequence $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{x}$ is bounded. Then $\mathbf{a} \in U$. Moreover, If $\mathbf{u} \colon= \left( u_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \in U$, then the sequence $\left( a_n - u_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is bounded; that is, there exists a positive real number $r_\mathbf{u}$ such that    $$ \left\lvert a_n - u_n \right\rvert < r_\mathbf{u} \ \mbox{ for all } \ n \in \mathbb{N}. $$   So if $\varepsilon \in (0, 1)$ and if $\mathbf{x}$ is any point of $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ such that $$ \bar{\rho}( \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{u} ) < \varepsilon, $$   then, for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we have    $$  \min\big\{ \ \left\lvert x_n - u_n \right\rvert, \ 1 \ \big\} \leq \bar{\rho}( \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{u} ) < \varepsilon < 1,  $$   and so    $$  \min\big\{ \ \left\lvert x_n - u_n \right\rvert, \  1 \big\} = \left\lvert x_n - u_n \right\rvert, $$   and thus    $$ \left\lvert x_n - u_n \right\rvert < \varepsilon. $$   Then, for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we obtain   $$  \begin{align} \left\lvert x_n - a_n \right\rvert &\leq \left\lvert x_n - u_n \right\rvert + \left\lvert u_n - a_n \right\rvert \\ &< \varepsilon + r_\mathbf{u}.  \end{align} $$   thus showing that $\mathbf{x} \in U$ also. Therefore $U$ is open in the uniform space $\mathbb{R}^\omega$. Now the point $\mathbf{b}$ is in the set $\mathbb{R}^\omega \setminus U$. Let $\mathbf{v}$ be any point of $\mathbb{R}^\omega \setminus U$. Then the sequence $\left( v_n - a_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is unbounded; so for any natural number $k$ there exists a natural number $m_k$ such that    $$ \left\lvert v_{m_k} - a_{m_k} \right\rvert > k. $$   Now if $\varepsilon \in (0, 1)$, and if $\mathbf{y}$ is any point of $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ such that    $$ \bar{\rho}( \mathbf{y}, \mathbf{v} ) < \varepsilon, $$    then as before we must have    $$ \left\lvert y_n - v_n \right\rvert < \varepsilon $$   for every natural number $n$. Now if $\lambda$ is an arbitrary real number and if $k$ is a natural number such that $k > \lambda + \varepsilon$, then we find that    $$ \begin{align} \left\lvert y_{m_k} - a_{m_k} \right\rvert &\geq  \left\lvert v_{m_k} - a_{m_k} \right\rvert  -  \left\lvert y_{m_k} - v_{m_k} \right\rvert  \\ &> k - \varepsilon \\ &> \lambda. \end{align} $$   Thus corresponding to any real number $\lambda$, no matter how large, we can find a natural number $m_k$ such that    $$ \left\lvert y_{m_k} - a_{m_k} \right\rvert > \lambda. $$   Thus the sequence $\left( y_n - a_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is unbounded, which shows that $\mathbf{y}$ is in $\mathbb{R}^\omega \setminus U$. Therefore the set $\mathbb{R}^\omega \setminus U$ is also open in the uniform metric space $\mathbb{R}^\omega$. Thus the sets $U$ and $\mathbb{R}^\omega \setminus U$ constitute a separation of the uniform metric space $\mathbb{R}^\omega$. Moreover, these two sets are both open and closed in $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ with the uniform topology. Finally, if $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ are any two points of $U$. then the sequences $\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{a}$  and $\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{a}$ are both bounded; so the sequence $\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y} = ( \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{a} ) - ( \mathbf{y} - \mathbf{a} )$ is bounded as well. Thus $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ are in the same (path) component of the uniform metric space $\mathbb{R}^\omega$, as has been shown above. Thus the set $U$ is (path) connected. Similarly, the set $V$ of all the points $\mathbf{v}$ in $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ such that $\mathbf{v} - \mathbf{b}$ is bounded is (path) connected. Moreover, $\mathbf{b}$ is in $V$ but $\mathbf{a}$ is not in $V$. Also $V$ is both open and closed in the uniform metric space $\mathbb{R}^\omega$, just as $U$ has been shown to be both open and closed. Moreover, the sets $U$ and $V$ are disjoint. I'm getting lost now! What next? How to proceed from here? Or, is there anywhere I've gone wrong? P.S.: I think I've just managed to hit upon the right trick! Now as the sets $U$ and $\mathbb{R}^\omega \setminus U$ form a separation of the uniform metric space $\mathbb{R}^\omega$, so any connected subspace lies in either $U$ or $\mathbb{R}^\omega \setminus U$, but not both. [Refer to Lemma 23.2 in Munkres.] As $\mathbf{a} \in U$, so the component containing $\mathbf{a}$, which is of course a connected subspace of $\mathbb{R}^\omega$, must also lie in $U$. And, as $\mathbf{b}$ is in $\mathbb{R}^\omega \setminus U$, so the component containing $\mathbf{b}$ lies in $\mathbb{R}^\omega \setminus U$. Therefore the points $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ lie in different components of $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ in the uniform topology if the sequence $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$ is unbounded.

82,Any reference on Jensen inequality for measurable convex functions on a Banach space?,Any reference on Jensen inequality for measurable convex functions on a Banach space?,,"The only proof of Jensen inequality (and most general version) that I know is a direct consequence of the Fenchel-Moreau Theorem : If $X$ is a locally convex Hausdorff topological space, let $\mu$ be a Borel probability measure and $x\in X$ be such that for all continuous linear functional $x^\ast\in X^\ast$ , $\int_X \langle y,x^\ast\rangle~d\mu=\langle x,x^\ast\rangle$ then we say that $\mu$ averages to $x$ , in symbol $\mu\sim x$ . The Fenchel-Moreau theorem states that the bidual of a proper l.s.c. convex function $f$ is the function itself. Recall that $f^\ast(x^\ast)=\sup_{x\in X} \langle x,x^\ast \rangle-f(x)$ and $f^{\ast\ast}(x)=\sup_{x^\ast\in X^\ast} \langle x,x^\ast\rangle-f^\ast(x^\ast)$ , the theorem states that on $X$ , $f=f^{\ast\ast}$ . Suppose that $\mu\sim x$ and $f$ is a proper l.s.c. convex function, then by Fenchel's inequality, for any $y\in X$ and any $x^\ast\in X^\ast$ , $\langle y,x^\ast\rangle\leq f(y)+f^\ast(x^\ast)$ , taking the integral over $\mu$ we get \begin{align*} \langle x,x^\ast\rangle &= \int_X \langle y,x^\ast\rangle d\mu(y)\\ &\leq \int_X \left[f(y)+f^\ast(x^\ast)\right] d\mu(y)\\ &= \int_X f ~d\mu + f^\ast(x^\ast) \end{align*} and therefore $\langle x,x^\ast\rangle-f^\ast(x^\ast)\leq \int_X f ~d\mu$ for all $x^\ast\in X^\ast$ , taking the supremum of the LHS over $x^\ast\in X^\ast$ we get $f(x)=f^{\ast\ast}(x)\leq \int_X f~d\mu$ . I am wondering if the result can be extended to any measurable convex function and if there is any literature on the subject. Is there something like For any Borel probability measure $\mu$ such that $\mu\sim x\in X$ and any bounded measurable convex functional $f:X\to\mathbb R$ , $f(x)\leq \int_X f~d\mu$ . Or is there any reason to believe that this would be false ? Also if true can we generalize to other measurable spaces $X$ where all points can be separated by measurable linear functional ? I think that I have a hint of proof whenever $X$ is a convex open subset of a Banach space and $f$ is a bounded convex functional, I think this is along the lines of what @MaoWao suggests. I would like to generalize this proof to the case where $X$ is a closed and bounded subset of a Banach space. We prove that in this case $f$ is actually lower semi continuous, by way of contradiction. Suppose that there is $x\in X$ and $x_n\to x$ such that $\liminf_n f(x_n) =f(x)-\delta$ with $\delta>0$ (which we want to contradict). Since $X$ is an open set, there is $\varepsilon>0$ such that $B_{2\varepsilon}(x)\subseteq X$ , for any $n$ , define $y_n=x-\varepsilon\frac{x_n-x}{\| x_n-x \|}\in B_{2\varepsilon}$ , in particular $y_n\in X$ . Observe that for any $n$ , $x= (1-\alpha_n)x_n + \alpha_n y_n$ with $\alpha_n=\frac{\| x_n-x\|}{\|x_n-x\|+\varepsilon}$ and therefore by convexity, \begin{align*} \Leftrightarrow&&(\| x_n-x\|+\varepsilon)f(x) &\leq \varepsilon f(x_n)+\| x_n-x\| f(y_n)\\ \Leftrightarrow&&\|x_n-x\| f(x) +\varepsilon (f(x)-f(x_n))\leq \|x_n-x\| f(y_n)\\ \Rightarrow && 0<\varepsilon \delta \leq \liminf_n\|x_n-x\| f(y_n)\\ \end{align*} But if $f$ is bounded then the RHS is $0$ which is a contradiction. Now since $f$ is l.s.c. then Jensen inequality applies and we are done. I am much more interested in the case where $X$ is a closed, convex and bounded subset of Banach space, in this case it feels like a similar argument could be made by working in the largest relatively open subset of $X$ containing $x$ , i.e. the largest set containing $x$ in it's relative interior, but there are many point I do not master here, any reference on that would be welcome, the only one I know is Rockafelar for finite dimension.","The only proof of Jensen inequality (and most general version) that I know is a direct consequence of the Fenchel-Moreau Theorem : If is a locally convex Hausdorff topological space, let be a Borel probability measure and be such that for all continuous linear functional , then we say that averages to , in symbol .

84,Adjunction of pointed maps is a homeomorphism?,Adjunction of pointed maps is a homeomorphism?,,"What interests me the most is if the case of exponential law is true under the assumptions claimed for example on nlab: if $X, Y$ are Hausdorff and $Y$ is locally compact, then $F^0(X, F^0(Y, Z))\cong F^0(X\wedge Y, Z)$ using the pointed adjunction. I split this in two parts for comparison. Part 1: Exponential law in $\text{Top}$ . Let $F(X, Y)$ be the space of continuous functions from $X$ to $Y$ with compact-open topology. We denote the subbasic open set by $(A, W) = \{f\in F(X, Y): f(A)\subseteq W\}$ , $A$ compact, $W$ open. Define adjunction as $\alpha:F(X\times Y, Z)\to F(X, F(Y, Z))$ by $\alpha(f)(x)(y) = f(x, y)$ . $\alpha$ is continuous. Proof: The subbasic open sets in $F(X, F(Y, Z))$ are of the form $(A, (B, W))$ where $A, B$ are compact and $W$ is open. But $\alpha^{-1}(A, (B, W)) = (A\times B, W)$ which is open in $F(X\times Y, Z)$ . Define evaluation map $e_{X, Y}:F(X, Y)\times X\to Y$ by $e_{X, Y}(f, x) = f(x)$ . $e_{Y, Z}$ is continuous for locally compact $Y$ . If $e_{Y, Z}$ is continuous then $\alpha$ is bijective. Above is just to assure that if the map $x\mapsto(y\mapsto f(x)(y))$ is continuous then so is $(x, y)\mapsto f(x)(y)$ . If $X, Y$ are locally compact then $\alpha:F(X\times Y, Z)\cong F(X, F(Y, Z)) $ . Proof: It suffices to show that $\alpha^{-1}$ is continuous. If $$\gamma = e_{X\times Y, Z} \circ (\alpha^{-1}\times \text{Id}_{X\times Y}):F(X, F(Y, Z))\times (X\times Y)\to Z$$ is continuous then $\alpha^{-1}$ is, because we can apply adjunction operator on $\gamma$ to obtain $\alpha^{-1}$ . Easy calculations show that $\gamma(f, (x, y)) = f(x)(y)$ and so $\gamma$ is the composition $$F(X, F(Y, Z))\times (X\times Y) \to (F(X, F(Y, Z))\times X) \times Y \to F(Y, Z)\times Y \to Z   $$ first map being the canonical homeomorphism, second and third being evaluation maps, continuous because $X, Y$ are locally compact. This proves $\alpha$ is a homeomorphism. There is also a similar theorem which I'll mention. Let $Y$ be locally compact, $X, Y$ be Hausdorff. Then $\alpha$ is a homeomorphism. Sketch of proof: It suffices to note that sets of the form $(A\times B, W)$ for compact $A, B$ and open $W$ form a subbasis of $F(X\times Y, Z)$ under our assumptions. Part 2: Exponential law in $\text{Top}^0$ ? Suppose that all spaces are pointed from now on. Let $F^0(X, Y)$ be the subspace of $F(X, Y)$ of pointed continuous functions from $X$ to $Y$ , with base point being the constant map onto the base point of $Y$ . Denote the subbasic sets by $(A, W)^0 = F^0(X, Y)\cap (A, W)$ for compact $A$ and open $W$ . Let $p:X\times Y\to X\wedge Y$ be canonical quotient map. For simplicity we'll denote $p(x, y) = x\wedge y$ . Define adjunction of pointed maps as $\alpha^0:F^0(X\wedge Y, Z)\to F^0(X, F^0(Y, Z))$ by $\alpha^0(f)(x)(y) = f(x\wedge y)$ . $\alpha^0$ is continuous. Proof: As before, $(\alpha^0)^{-1}(A, (B, W)^0)^0 = (p(A\times B), W)^0$ , the sets of the form $(A, (B, W)^0)^0$ being subbasic. Define the pointed evaluation map $e_{X, Y}^0:F^0(X, Y)\wedge X\to Y$ by $e_{X, Y}^0(f \wedge x) = f(x)$ . $e_{Y, Z}^0$ is continuous for locally compact $Y$ . If $e_{Y, Z}^0$ is continuous then $\alpha^0$ is bijective. This is again just so that if $x\mapsto(y\mapsto f(x)(y))$ is continuous then also $x \wedge y\mapsto f(x)(y)$ . Finally: If $X, Y$ are locally compact, is $\alpha^0:F^0(X\wedge Y, Z)\cong F^0(X, F^0(Y, Z))$ ? Attempt at a proof: Once again we only need to show that $(\alpha^0)^{-1}$ is continuous. Consider the map $$\gamma^0 = e_{X\wedge Y, Z}^0 \circ ((\alpha^0)^{-1}\wedge \text{Id}_{X\wedge Y}) : F^0(X, F^0(Y, Z))\wedge (X\wedge Y)\to Z $$ explicitly $\gamma^0(f \wedge (x \wedge y)) = f(x)(y)$ . If $\gamma$ is continuous then by some version of pointed adjunction, so is $\alpha^{-1}$ . Once again we can decompose it into three maps, one being canonical and other two being pointed evaluation maps. However, the approach breaks down. Denoting $Q = F^0(X, F^0(Y, Z))$ , we'd have to show that the canonical map $Q\wedge (X\wedge Y)\to (Q \wedge X)\wedge Y$ is continuous. If we look at the statement of associativity of smash product, its proof uses Whiteheads theorem: If $q:X\to Y$ is quotient and $Z$ is locally compact then $q\times \text{Id}_Z$ is a quotient. More explicitly, to show that $Q\wedge (X\wedge Y)\to (Q\wedge X)\wedge Y$ is continuous, it uses that $Q$ is locally compact by showing $\text{Id}_Q\times p$ is a quotient map. Now to save this proof, two things come to mind. Assume that $Q$ is locally compact. I think this is a heavy and unwieldy assumption. Assume that $p$ is a proper map. This is somewhat better, and in case when $X, Y$ are compact Hausdorff spaces, $X\wedge Y$ is also compact Hausdorff as shown here https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1645794/476484 so $p$ is proper.

85,Topologist's sine curve is a simply-connected space,Topologist's sine curve is a simply-connected space,,"I am trying to solve the following problem from Hatcher's Algebraic Topology and have written a solution. Could you help me checking my solution, whether I am right? Thanks in advance. $Y$ is simply-connected: Let $$A=\bigg\{\bigg(x,\sin \frac{1}{x}\bigg):0<x\leq 1\bigg\}\text{ and }X=\big\{(0,y):-1\leq y\leq 1\big\}\bigcup A.$$ and $C$ be a simple curve in $\Bbb R^2$ such that $C\cap X=\big\{(0,0),\big(1,\sin 1\big)\big\}$ . Define $Y=X\cup C$ . Now, for each $1\geq \delta>0$ let $$A_\delta=\bigg\{\bigg(x,\sin \frac{1}{x}\bigg):\delta<x\leq 1\bigg\}\text{ and }X_\delta=A_\delta\bigcup\big\{(0,y):-1\leq y\leq 1\big\} ,$$ $$Y_\delta:=X_\delta\cup C.$$ Note that $$Y=\bigcup_{0<\delta\leq 1}Y_\delta.$$ Note that $Y$ is path-connected, we show $\pi_1\big(Y,(0,0)\big)=0$ . Let $\alpha=(\alpha_1,\alpha_2)$ be a loop in $Y$ based at $(0,0)$ . If possible let for each $n\in \Bbb N$ we have $$\text{Image}(\alpha)\cap B_{n}\not=\emptyset\text{ where }B_n:=\bigg\{\bigg(x,\sin \frac{1}{x}\bigg):0<x<\frac{1}{n}\bigg\}.$$ Take, $\alpha(t_n)=(x_n,y_n)\in \text{Image}(\alpha)\cap B_{n}$ for each $n\in\Bbb N$ , so $\alpha_1(t_n)=x_n\to 0$ . Since $[0,1]$ is compact passing to the subsequence we may assume $t_n\to c\in [0,1]$ . So, $\alpha_1(c)=0$ . Also, $-1\leq \alpha_2(c)\leq 1$ as $X$ is closed. Since, $\alpha_1(t_n)=x_n\to 0$ by intermediate value theorem $\alpha_1$ takes all values $\frac{1}{n\pi}$ for all large $n\in\Bbb N$ . Suppose $\frac{1}{k\pi}\in \text{Image}(\alpha_1)$ for all $k\in\Bbb N$ with $k\geq k_0$ , where $k_0\in\Bbb N$ . Let $\alpha_1(t_m)=x_m<\frac{1}{k\pi}<\alpha_1(t_n)=x_n$ for some $m,n\in\Bbb N$ . So, by intermediate value theorem we have $t_m<t_k^*<t_n$ such that $\alpha_1(t_k^*)=\frac{1}{k\pi}$ . Hence, $t_k^*\to c$ as $k\to \infty$ . Now, $\alpha_2(t_k^*)\in\{\pm 1\}$ for all $k\geq k_0$ . So, there is no neighbourhood of $c$ mapped into $\big\{x\in\Bbb R:\alpha_2(c)-\varepsilon<x<\alpha_2(c)+\varepsilon\big\}$ , where $\varepsilon>0$ is so chosen that $\big\{x\in\Bbb R:\alpha_2(c)-\varepsilon<x<\alpha_2(c)+\varepsilon\big\}$ contains exactly one element from $\{\pm 1\}$ , as each nbd of $c$ contains some $t_k^*$ . And this is a contradiction to the continuity of $\alpha_2$ . So, for large $n$ we have $\text{Image}(\alpha)\cap B_n=\emptyset.$ That's, $\text{Image}(\alpha)\subseteq Y_{\delta}$ for some $\delta>0$ . Now, the space $Y_{\delta}$ is homeomorphic to the space $\big\{(x,0):-1< x\leq 0\big\}\cup\big\{(0,y):-1\leq y\leq 1\big\}.$ So, $Y_{\delta}$ is contractible. Hence, $\pi_1\big(Y_{\delta},(0,0)\big)=0$ . In other words, there is a homotopy $H:[0,1]\times [0,1]\to Y_{\delta}$ such that $H:\alpha\simeq_{\text{rel }(0,0)}C_{(0,0)}$ , So, extending the co-domain we have a homotopy $H:[0,1]\times [0,1]\to Y$ such that $H:\alpha\simeq_{\text{rel }(0,0)}C_{(0,0)}$ . So, $\pi_1\big(Y,(0,0)\big)=0$ . Now, $$\Bbb S^1\cong\frac{C}{\big\{(0,0),(1,\sin 1)\big\}}\cong\frac{Y}{X}$$ considering inclusion map $i:C\hookrightarrow Y$ . So, we have a quotient map $f:Y\to \frac{Y}{X}=\Bbb S^1$ . Let $p:\Bbb R\ni t\longmapsto e^{2\pi it}\in \Bbb S^1$ be the universal cover. No Lifting: Now, suppose we have continuous lifting as in the picture below. Now, $p^{-1}(1)=p^{-1}\big([X]\big)$ is a discrete set, so continuity of $\widetilde f$ implies $\widetilde f(0,y)=0$ for $-1\leq y\leq 1$ as $f(0,y)=[X]=1$ for $-1\leq y\leq 1$ . Similarly, $\widetilde f$ is identically $0$ on $\big\{\big(x,\sin \frac{1}{x}\big):0<x\leq 1\big\}\subseteq X$ using continuity. Note that $f$ is surjective, so image of $\widetilde f$ contains either of the two intervals $(-1,0)\subseteq \Bbb R$ or $(0,1)\subseteq \Bbb R$ . Without loss of generality assume, the latter one. Next, for each point $z\in C\backslash \big\{(0,0),(1,\sin 1)\big\}$ the equivalence class $[z]\in \frac{Y}{X}$ is a singleton set and $p^{-1}\big([z]\big)\cap \{x\in\Bbb R:0<x<1\}$ is singleton. So, if $C \backslash \big\{(0,0),(1,\sin 1)\big\}\ni z\longrightarrow (0,0)$ , then $\widetilde f(z)=p^{-1}\big([z]\big)\cap \{x\in\Bbb R:0<x<1\}\longrightarrow 0\in\Bbb R$ and if $C \backslash \big\{(0,0),(1,\sin 1)\big\}\ni z\longrightarrow (1,\sin 1)$ , then $\widetilde f(z)=p^{-1}\big([z]\big)\cap \{x\in\Bbb R:0<x<1\}\longrightarrow 1\in\Bbb R$ , a contradiction as $\widetilde f$ is identically $0$ on $\big\{\big(x,\sin \frac{1}{x}\big):0<x\leq 1\big\}$ .","I am trying to solve the following problem from Hatcher's Algebraic Topology and have written a solution.

86,Order-preserving map of regressive functions on $\omega_1$,Order-preserving map of regressive functions on,\omega_1,"I posted the following question in March 2014 on MO . It did receive some attention, but the answer there remains incomplete. It was motivated by some paracompactness-type properties as discussed at the end, but the question is purely order-theoretic, about $\omega_1$ . Let $\omega_1$ be the first uncountable ordinal, same as the set of all countable ordinals. Let $\mathcal F$ be the set of all functions $f:\omega_1\to\omega_1$ that are: (a) regressive i.e. $f(\alpha) < \alpha$ for all $0 < \alpha < \omega_1$ , and (b) non-decreasing (same as $\le$ -order-preserving), i.e., if $0\le\alpha \leq \beta<\omega_1$ then $f(\alpha)\leq f(\beta)$ . Define a partial order $\sqsubseteq$ on $\mathcal F$ by $f \sqsubseteq g$ if $f(\alpha) \leq g(\alpha)$ for all $\alpha < \omega_1$ . Let $\mathcal K$ be the subset of $\mathcal F$ , consisting of functions with a finite range. Formally $\mathcal K=\{f\in\mathcal F: |\{f(\alpha):\alpha<\omega_1\}|<\aleph_0\}$ . Question: Is there a $\sqsubseteq$ -order-preserving map (same as a $\sqsubseteq$ -non-decreasing map) $\psi : \mathcal F \to \mathcal K$ , i.e if $f \sqsubseteq g$ then $\psi(f) \sqsubseteq \psi(g)$ , and with the additional property that $\psi(f) \sqsupseteq f$ for all $f\in \mathcal F$ ? Let me summarize some comments made at MO, clarifying certain partial answers. Partial answer (A) . Since every $f\in\mathcal F$ is regressive and non-decreasing, it must be eventually constant and reach its maximal value $\mu_f=\max\{f(\alpha):\alpha < \omega_1\}$ . One is tempted to define $\psi(f)(\alpha)=\mu_f$ for all $\alpha$ . The problem is that this is not regressive: We have $\psi(f)(\alpha)<\alpha$ only when $\alpha>\mu_f$ , but I insist that $\psi(f)(\alpha)<\alpha$ whenever $0<\alpha<\omega_1$ . Partial answer (B) . If we drop the requirement that $\psi$ be a $\sqsubseteq$ -non-decreasing map then the answer by @NoahS at MO works, as well as one of my comments there, which  I include below. As above let $\mu_f=\max\{f(\alpha):\alpha < \omega_1\}$ and let $\gamma_f=\min\{\alpha:f(\alpha)=\mu_f\}$ . (Then $f(\alpha)=\mu_f$ for $\alpha\ge\gamma_f$ , and $f(\alpha)<\mu_f$ for $\alpha<\gamma_f$ . Usually $\mu_f<\gamma_f$ unless $\mu_f=0=\gamma_f$ .) Let $\alpha_{0,f}=\mu_f$ . If $\mu_f\ge1$ then let $\alpha_{1,f}=f(\alpha_{0,f})<\alpha_{0,f}$ . There is a non-negative integer $n_f$ such that $\alpha_{k+1,f}=f(\alpha_{k,f})<\alpha_{k,f}$ for $k<n_f$ , and $\alpha_{n_f,f}=0$ . Define $\psi(f)$ as follows. If $\alpha>\alpha_{0,f}$ then let $\psi(f)(\alpha)=\alpha_{0,f}=\mu_f$ . If $\alpha_{k+1,f}<\alpha\le\alpha_{k,f}$ then let $\psi(f)(\alpha)=\alpha_{k+1,f}$ . (Formally also $\psi(f)(0)=0$ , but in general each function in $\mathcal F$ being regressive must take value $0$ at $1$ , and being non-decreasing must take value $0$ at $0$ as well.) Then $\psi(f)\in\mathcal K$ and $\psi(f)\sqsupseteq f$ . So partial answer (A) above achieves that $\psi(f)$ has a finite range, and $\psi(f) \sqsubseteq \psi(g)$ whenever $f \sqsubseteq g$ , and also $\psi(f) \sqsupseteq f$ . It almost achieves that $\psi(f)$ is regressive, but not quite, and it follows that $\psi(f)$ is not in $\mathcal K$ unless $\mu_f=0$ . (One could perhaps say that $\psi(f)$ is "" regressive on a tail "" only, which might in a different context be good enough, but the requirement in my question is that $\psi(f)(\alpha)<\alpha$ whenever $0<\alpha<\omega_1$ .) On the other hand, partial answer $B$ achieves that $\psi(f)\in\mathcal K$ (in particular both that $\psi(f)$ is regressive and has a finite range), and $\psi(f) \sqsupseteq f$ for all $f\in \mathcal F$ , but not necessarily that $\psi(f) \sqsubseteq \psi(g)$ whenever $f\sqsubseteq g$ . It is not clear to me if we could achieve all conditions simultaneously. Edit. Following a comment (on MO), let me clarify why in partial answer $B$ we need not have $\psi(f) \sqsubseteq \psi(g)$ whenever $f\sqsubseteq g$ . Fix any ordinals $0<\beta<\delta<\nu<\omega_1$ . Let $f(\alpha)=g(\alpha)=0$ if $0\le\alpha<\nu$ . Let $f(\alpha)=\beta$ and $g(\alpha)=\delta$ if $\alpha\ge\nu$ . Clearly $f\sqsubseteq g$ . Then $\psi(f)(\alpha)=\beta$ if $\alpha>\beta$ , and $\psi(f)(\alpha)=0$ if $0\le\alpha\le\beta$ (where $\psi$ is as in partial answer $B$ ). While $\psi(g)(\alpha)=\delta$ if $\alpha>\delta$ , and $\psi(g)(\alpha)=0$ if $0\le\alpha\le\delta$ . In particular, if $\beta<\alpha\le\delta$ then $\psi(g)(\alpha)=0<\beta=\psi(f)(\alpha)$ , so $\psi(f)\not\sqsubseteq \psi(g)$ . If I were to make a guess, I would say the answer is no. This question is an order-theoretic restatement of a question from general topology that a co-author and I considered : Whether $\omega_1$ has a monotone interior-preserving open operator $r$ , that is, if $\mathcal U$ is any open cover of $\omega_1$ , with the order topology, then $r(\mathcal U)$ is an interior-preserving open refinement that covers $\omega_1$ , and if $\mathcal U$ refines $\mathcal V$ then $r(\mathcal U)$ refines $r(\mathcal V)$ . As usual we would write $\mathcal U\preceq \mathcal V$ if $\mathcal U$ refines $\mathcal V$ . In this context $f$ is intended to encode an open cover $\mathcal U(f)=\{0\}\cup\{(f(\alpha),\alpha]:\alpha<\omega_1\}$ . Note that if $f\sqsubseteq g$ then $\mathcal U(g)\preceq \mathcal U(f)$ .

87,Is there such a thing as 'overtification' (dual to compactification)?,Is there such a thing as 'overtification' (dual to compactification)?,,"The dual to the notion of compactness for spaces is overtness. This duality is not manifest in the category of spaces but rather in the quantifiers used to define these notions. Is there a process of 'overtification' corresponding to the process of compactification? Since all topological spaces are overt, this would have to be defined over locales instead. Edit: I've very new to this topic, so I am not well versed. Most of my understanding comes from this Math Overflow answer by Andrej Bauer . I'll mostly reproduce that here, probably more for my benefit than anyone else's. To define overtness, first we must suitable define compactness in a way that can be nicely dualized. If $X$ is a space, let $\mathcal{O}(X)$ be its topology (as a poset) equipped with the Scott topology . Let $\Sigma = \{0,1\}$ be the Sierpinski space, with topology $\{\emptyset, \{1\}, \{0,1\}\}$, which also happens to be the Scott topology on the poset $0 \leq 1$. The Sierpinski space acts as an 'open-set' classifier, meaning that for any open subspace $A \subseteq X$, $\chi^{-1}_A(1) = A$, where $\chi_A$ is the characteristic function  $$\chi_A(x) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } x \in A \\ 0 & \text{if }x\not\in A \end{cases}$$ Anyway, let's look at the function $\forall_X: \mathcal{O}(X) \rightarrow \Sigma$ defined as $$\forall_X(U) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } U = X \\ 0 & \text{if } U \neq X \end{cases}$$ This map is the universal quantifier over $X$ (hence the $\forall$ symbol), because its value on a subset $U$ is the truth value of the statement $\forall x \in X .(x \in U)$. It is not too hard to see that this is the right adjoint to the frame map $\mathcal{O}(1) \rightarrow \mathcal{O}(X)$, which is the map induced by the unique map $X \rightarrow 1$. (Note that $\mathcal{O}(1) = \Sigma$) We then have: $\textbf{Theorem. }$ A space $X$ is compact if and only if $\forall_X$ is continuous.(This is not obvious to me, but I haven't spent too much time thinking about it) Anyway, now we are ready to dualize. We just have to look for a $\textit{left}$ adjoint to $\Sigma \rightarrow \mathcal{O}(X)$, which we find in  $$\exists_X(U) = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if } U = \emptyset \\ 1 & \text{else} \end{cases}$$ The notation is again inspired by the fact that on a subset $U$ the value of $\exists_X$ is the truth value of the statement $\exists x \in X.(x \in U)$. Now we define: $\textbf{Definition.}$ $X$ is overt if and only if $\exists_X$ is continuous. 'Overtification' would then be a nice or natural way to take a frame/locale and 'make it overt' in the way that compactification can take a space and 'make it compact'. If anyone has an further reading suggestions in this area I would gladly welcome them! Thanks.","The dual to the notion of compactness for spaces is overtness.

The Sierpinski space acts as an 'open-set' classifier, meaning that for any open subspace $A \subseteq X$, $\chi^{-1}_A(1) = A$, where $\chi_A$ is the characteristic function  $$\chi_A(x) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } x \in A \\ 0 & \text{if }x\not\in A \end{cases}$$ Anyway, let's look at the function $\forall_X: \mathcal{O}(X) \rightarrow \Sigma$ defined as $$\forall_X(U) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } U = X \\ 0 & \text{if } U \neq X \end{cases}$$ This map is the universal quantifier over $X$ (hence the $\forall$ symbol), because its value on a subset $U$ is the truth value of the statement $\forall x \in X .(x \in U)$. It is not too hard to see that this is the right adjoint to the frame map $\mathcal{O}(1) \rightarrow \mathcal{O}(X)$, which is the map induced by the unique map $X \rightarrow 1$. (Note that $\mathcal{O}(1) = \Sigma$) We then have: $\textbf{Theorem. }$ A space $X$ is compact if and only if $\forall_X$ is continuous.(This is not obvious to me, but I haven't spent too much time thinking about it) Anyway, now we are ready to dualize. We just have to look for a $\textit{left}$ adjoint to $\Sigma \rightarrow \mathcal{O}(X)$, which we find in  $$\exists_X(U) = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if } U = \emptyset \\ 1 & \text{else} \end{cases}$$ The notation is again inspired by the fact that on a subset $U$ the value of $\exists_X$ is the truth value of the statement $\exists x \in X.(x \in U)$. Now we define: $\textbf{Definition.}$ $X$ is overt if and only if $\exists_X$ is continuous. 'Overtification' would then be a nice or natural way to take a frame/locale and 'make it overt' in the way that compactification can take a space and 'make it compact'. If anyone has an further reading suggestions in this area I would gladly welcome them! Thanks.",,"['general-topology', 'category-theory', 'lattice-orders', 'constructive-mathematics']"
