2,Asymptotic Behavior of a Sum with Binomial Coefficients,Asymptotic Behavior of a Sum with Binomial Coefficients,,"The Problem : Find the asymptotic behavior (with respect to $n$) of the following sum $$\sum\limits_{j = 3}^n \binom{n}{j} \frac{(j - 1)!}{2\cdot n^j}. $$ Where the Problem Comes From :  If we consider the random graph $G(n,p)$, i.e. the graph on $n$ vertices where each possible edge is added independently with probability $p$, then the expected number of cycles is $$ \sum\limits_{j = 3}^n \binom{n}{j} \frac{(j - 1)!}{2} p^j. $$ If we take $p = 1/n$, then we get the sum mentioned above. What I've Done So Far :  We can get a quick-and-not-so-great bound as follows: \begin{align*}  \sum\limits_{j = 3}^n \binom{n}{j} \frac{(j - 1)!}{2\cdot n^j} &= \sum\limits_{j = 3}^n \frac{n!}{j\cdot(n - j)!} \frac{1}{2\cdot n^j} \\ &\leq \sum\limits_{j = 3}^n \frac{n^j}{j} \frac{1}{2\cdot n^j} \\ &= \sum\limits_{j = 3}^n \frac{1}{2\cdot j} \\ &=O(\log(n)). \end{align*} However, based on a quick program I wrote, it seems that maybe this should actually be $O(1)$, as this sum appears to stay below $1$, even when $n = 130$ (about as large as Python will allow me before hitting an overflow error). Using Stirling's formula (in various different ways) yielded no result.  I also tried: \begin{align} \sum \binom{n}{j}\frac{(j-1)!}{2 n^j} &\leq \sum \left( \frac{e n}{j}\right)^j \frac{(j-1)!}{2 \cdot n^j} \\ &= \sum \frac{e^j (j - 1)!}{2\cdot j^j} \end{align} which diverges as $n \to \infty$.  However, the sum $$ \sum \frac{\alpha^j (j - 1)!}{j^j}$$ converges for all $|\alpha| < e$.  This suggests that maybe one could bound $$\binom{n}{j} \leq \left(\frac{\alpha n}{j}\right)^j $$ for some $\alpha < e$ (not depending on $n$) for all but $\log(n)$ terms; then we could break the terms up into those bounded with the constant $\alpha$ (which would converge) and the $\log(n)$ terms bounded with the constant $e$, which would also work.  I haven't been able to figure out how to make that estimate work, though. So, is this $O(1)$?  Is it $O(\log(n))$?

I tried to use Cayley graph's arguments but got lost. So basically I have the following questions: How can I know if the graph I described for $(m,n)$ is the Cayley graph of a group? And if so, is it the Cayley graph of a well-known group? Is my Cayley argument too complicated and there is a simpler proof? Do you have any tips for drawing the $(m,n)$ tiling?

By staring at images of these tilings this seems completely plausible, but I am having troubles formalizing it. I have been able to prove that this indeed happens in $(4,5)$. I tried to use Cayley graph's arguments but got lost. So basically I have the following questions: How can I know if the graph I described for $(m,n)$ is the Cayley graph of a group? And if so, is it the Cayley graph of a well-known group? Is my Cayley argument too complicated and there is a simpler proof? Do you have any tips for drawing the $(m,n)$ tiling? Can you help me with this proof or point me to some theory that may help? Thanks in advance! : )",,"['combinatorics', 'graph-theory', 'hyperbolic-geometry']"

16,Are there non-equivalent cardinal arithmetics?,Are there non-equivalent cardinal arithmetics?,,"‎Generalizing a concept in mathematics is always a problematic situation. In most cases there are several ways to generalize a notion and it is not easy to decide if a particular generalization is more natural , useful or better than the other alternatives. The same situation happens in set theory when we are trying to generalize the arithmetic operators to infinities. The case of ordinal arithmetic is less controversial because it has a straightforward recursive definition applicable for all usual and hyperoperators. But in the case of cardinal arithmetic we have defined all addition, multiplication and exponentiation cases separately as follows: $\kappa+\lambda$ is the size of disjoint union of two sets with $\kappa$ and $\lambda$ elements . $\kappa.\lambda$ is the size of Cartesian product of two sets with $\kappa$ and $\lambda$ elements . $\kappa^\lambda$ is the size of set of all functions from a set with $\lambda$ elements to a set with $\kappa$ elements. In each case we isolated a combinatorial property and defined our arithmetic operator as the size of a set definable from parameters $\kappa$ and $\lambda$ . As it is clear this method of generalizing operators could be done in many different ways and some of them could be non-equivalent . For example in finite combinatorics $m+n$ could be size of many different definable sets rather than disjoint union and these definable notions could be different on infinite cardinals. Note that according to the usual definition of our cardinal arithmetic which remained unchanged since the beginning of set theory, the first two operators (addition and multiplication) became counter-intuitively equal and as trivial as maximum operator. Also they are completely determined within ZFC. On the other hand the third operator (exponentiation) became highly non-trivial and completely undetermined even in the simplest case. i.e. ZFC cannot decide about the value of $\aleph_0^{\aleph_0}$ . Why such a large gap exists between cardinal exponentiation and cardinal addition and multiplication? Why addition and multiplication are counter-intuitively equal? Are there better arithmetics on cardinal numbers which have a more natural behavior , a rich theory and a deep connection with each other? Let us explore the above questions more precisely by considering all possible definitions for arithmetic operators over cardinals. Definition 1: Let $*:\omega\times\omega\rightarrow\omega$ be an arithmetic operator (i.e. ordinary addition, multiplication, exponentiation, tetration, ... over natural numbers), the first order formula $\phi (x,y,z)$ in the language of set theory is called a $*$ - notion over cardinals (e.g. addition notion over cardinals, multiplication notion over cardinals, etc.) if and only if $(a)~~ZFC\vdash \forall \kappa,\lambda\in Card~~~~~\{x~|~\phi (x,\kappa,\lambda)\}$ is a set. $(b)~~ZFC\vdash \forall m,n\in\omega~~~~~| \{x~|~\phi (x,m,n)\} |=m*n$ Associated with any $*$ - notion $\phi (x,y,z)$ over cardinals one can define an operator $*_{\phi}:Card\times Card\rightarrow Card$ as follows: $\forall\kappa,\lambda\in Card~~~~~\kappa *_{\phi}\lambda :=|\{x~|~\phi (x,\kappa,\lambda)\}|$ Note that by property $(a)$ , the operator $*_{\phi}$ is well-defined. Also by property $(b)$ it is a generalization of arithmetic operator $*$ to infinite cardinals. Example: If $+:\omega\times\omega\rightarrow\omega$ is the ordinary addition of natural numbers then the first order formula $\phi (x,y,z):\exists s\in y~\exists t\in z~~~x=\langle s,0 \rangle \vee x=\langle t,1\rangle$ asserting that "" $x$ is a member of disjoint union $y$ and $z$ "" is a $+$ - notion over cardinals and the corresponding operator $+_{\phi}:Card\times Card\rightarrow Card$ is the usual addition of cardinals. Definition 2: If $*:\omega\times\omega\rightarrow\omega$ is an arithmetic operator and $\phi (x,y,z), \psi (x,y,z)$ are two $*$ - notions over cardinals, we call $\phi, \psi$ equivalent , $\phi \sim \psi$ , if and only if their corresponding cardinal arithmetics are same. i.e. $$ZFC\vdash \forall\kappa,\lambda\in Card~~~~~\kappa *_{\phi}\lambda = \kappa *_{\psi}\lambda$$ Question 1: Is there any addition notion for cardinals non-equivalent to the usual addition notion of cardinals? If yes, how many of such addition notions are there up to $\sim$ equivalence relation? In the other words, is there any formula $\phi (x,y,z)$ such that: $ZFC\vdash \forall \kappa,\lambda\in Card~~~~~\{x~|~\phi (x,\kappa,\lambda)\}$ is a set $ZFC\vdash \forall m,n\in\omega~~~~~| \{x~|~\phi (x,m,n)\} |=m+n$ $ZFC\nvdash \forall\kappa,\lambda\in Card~~~~~\kappa *_{\phi}\lambda = \kappa +\lambda$ What about multiplication and exponentiation? In particular, is there an exponentiation notion over cardinals that its value in the simplest case, $\aleph_0$ , remains undetermined even if we have a full knowledge of values of the usual cardinal exponentiation by assuming GCH? Precisely, is there any formula $\phi (x,y,z)$ in the language of set theory such that: $ZFC\vdash \forall \kappa,\lambda\in Card~~~~~\{x~|~\phi (x,\kappa,\lambda)\}$ is a set $ZFC\vdash \forall m,n\in\omega~~~~~| \{x~|~\phi (x,m,n)\} |=m^n$ $ZFC+GCH\nvdash \aleph_0 *_{\phi} \aleph_0=\aleph_0^{\aleph_0}$ (equivalently $ZFC+GCH\nvdash | \{x~|~\phi (x,\aleph_0,\aleph_0)\} |=\aleph_1$ ) Besides nice behavior of each particular arithmetic operator over cardinals, it is important to consider the relative situation of these operators with respect to each other. In fact we should search for a sequence of generalizations for addition, multiplication, exponentiation, ... on cardinals that satisfies some nice properties. Definition 3: Let $\{*^i\}_{i\in \omega}$ be the natural enumeration of all arithmetic operators on natural numbers (i.e. $*^0$ , $*^1$ , $*^2$ , $*^3$ are addition, multiplication, exponentiation and tetration respectively.) and $\{\phi_{i}(x,y,z)\}_{i\in\omega}$ is a sequence of formulas such that $\forall i\in\omega~~~\phi_{i}(x,y,z)$ is a $*^i$ - notion. Now consider the sequence $\{*^{i}_{\phi_{i}}\}_{i\in\omega}$ of arithmetic notions over cardinals. We call the sequence $\{*^{i}_{\phi_{i}}\}_{i\in\omega}$ natural iff $$\forall i\in\omega~\forall\kappa,\lambda\in Card\setminus\{0,1\}~~~~~\kappa *^{i}_{\phi_{i}}\lambda >\kappa, \lambda$$ e.g. Each sequence of cardinal arithmetics which contains the usual addition (or multiplication) of infinite cardinals is not natural because for all infinite cardinals $\kappa, \lambda$ we have $\kappa +\lambda = \kappa$ or $\kappa +\lambda = \kappa$ . Two sequences $\{*^{i}_{\phi_{i}}\}_{i\in\omega}$ and $\{*^{i}_{\psi_{i}}\}_{i\in\omega}$ are equivalent, $\{*^{i}_{\phi_{i}}\}_{i\in\omega}\sim\{*^{i}_{\psi_{i}}\}_{i\in\omega}$ , iff $$\forall i\in\omega~~~~~\phi_i\sim\psi_i$$ Question 2: How many natural sequences of cardinal arithmetics are there up to equivalence relation defined in definition 3?

20,Twin-prime sieve,Twin-prime sieve,,"My question concerns the following sieve (call it S), which was an exercise in applying some elementary aspects of Brun's sieve while reading Halberstam's text. Using the Chinese Remainder theorem we can show : (S) The number of $n$ such that $n,n+2$ are co-prime to $p_k\#$  for $n =1,2,...,p_k\#$ is $$\prod_{i=1}^k (p_i-2).$$ So for example on $[1,5\#]$ there are 3 pairs n,n+2 co-prime to 2,3,5 and those are $(11,13),(17,19),(29,31).$ The smallest prime dividing any sieved $n$ is 7, and because $7^2$ is larger than $2\cdot3\cdot5$ it must be that the largest power of this minimal prime (a factor of $n$ or $n+2$) is 1. Therefore the sieved pairs are twin primes. For larger $p_k\#$ the minimal prime $p$ (the smallest such that $p< p_{k}\#< p^2$) is larger than $p_{k+1}.$ Put another way, the power $\Omega$ of $p_{k+1}$ such that $(p_{k+1})^{\Omega}\leq p_k\#$ is increasing.  The best we can say using (S) is that $n,n+2$ have at most $\Omega$ prime factors, and $\Omega$ grows without bound as $k$ gets large. For small $k$ we can avoid the problem in a facile way. Call the modified sieve S'. As an example, on the interval $[1,13\#]$ the number of $n,n+2$ co-prime to $13\#$ is 1485. Unfortunately $p_{k+1}=17$ and $17^3 <13\#. $ So the best we can say is that $n,n+2$ have at most 3 prime factors. However if we sieve (the same interval) using $p_{40}\#=173\#,$ then $p_{k+1} = 179$ and 179, not by accident, is the smallest prime $p$ such that $p < 13\# < p^2.$ Because we are using more primes to sieve the same interval, the number of counted (co-prime to $p_{40}\#$) pairs $n,n+2$ falls from 1485 to 456. On the other hand, because 179 is the smallest prime occurring in any sieved pair and cannot occur as a power greater than one (else it exceeds 13#), all 456 pairs are twin primes (I checked.) While one might hope show that the cardinality of prime pairs $n, n+2$ is increasing with $k$  despite the need to choose increasingly large minimal primes (in the sense above), what seems more likely (because simple approaches like this were discarded en route to Brun's sieve) is that as increasingly large primes are needed, even if they are small compared to $p_k\#$, a point is reached beyond which $|\{n, n+2\}|$ is no longer increasing. But the reason for this eludes me. There may be some other issue here, so my question is: Can someone explain why S' fails, or give an argument that the number of sieved pairs using S' above will eventually fail to increase as $k$ gets large? In the spirit of ""What have you tried?"" let $p_{k+m}$ be the the smallest prime s.t. $p_{k+m}< p_k\# <p_{k+m}^2 $ or $$p_{k+m}~ \text{minimal s.t.}~ p_{k+m} > p_k\#^{(1/2)}.$$ For large $k,$ $p_{k+m}$ is relatively close to $p_k\#^{(1/2)}$ and the proportion of the interval $[1,p_k\#]$ being sieved is $$\sim(1-1/\sqrt{p_k\#}).$$ So the number of primes greater than $p_k$ on the interval $[\sqrt{p_k\#},p_k\#]$ is $$\sim p_k\#/\log p_k\#\sim p_k\#/p_k.$$ The number of multiples of $p_{k+1}, p_{k+2},..., p_{k+m}$ on the same interval is $$p_k\#/p_{k+1}+p_{k\#}/p_{k+2},... = p_k\#(1/p_{k+1}+1/p_{k+2}+...+1/p_{k+m})$$ and $$1/p_k < 1/p_{k+1}+1/p_{k+2}+...+1/p_{k+m}. $$ So even though the number of primes is increasing, relatively few survive the sieve and we can't be sure the cardinality of sifted pairs is strictly increasing...?

Assuming someone would like to play all combinations, this means filling out $\binom{45}{6}$, or 8145060 grids, which would be a logistical nightmare and hasn't, as far as I know, attempted since 1990 (and that was with 1947792 grids). However, the Belgian lottery also offers ""multiple"" betslips, in which one picks 7 to 15 numbers, so that all combination of 6 numbers out of these are played, allowing one to play up to 5005 combinations with a single betslip. At first glance, this would seem to be a solution to the logistical issues, but to ensure each combination is played only once, there should be no overlap; that is, a combination of 6 numbers is present only on one betslip. This would be possible using multiple betslips filled with n numbers if there exists a Steiner system S(6,n,45). Obviously S(6,15,45) doesn't exist, as $\binom{45}{6}/\binom{15}{6}$, which would be the number of blocks (or betslips filled) isn't an integer. Similarly, we can show that S(6,14,45) and S(6,13,45) don't exist either. Another property of Steiner systems is that the existence of S(t−1,k−1,n−1) is a necessary condition for the existence of S(t,k,n). With this property, we can also eliminate S(6,12,45) since S(5,11,44) doesn't exist as $\binom{44}{5}/\binom{11}{5}$ is not an integer. Similarly, we can rule out S(6,11,45), S(6,10,45), S(6,8,45) and (6,7,45). However, S(6,9,45) can't be eliminated that way, as all subsystems do have an integer number of blocks.

I know that the unrestricted password space would be (26+26+10+35)^15 = 6.33*10^29 so the final answer must be less than that. My first approach was to find all of the invalid passwords and subtract that from the unrestricted password space. However, even this step proved to be too complicated to for me. I broke down all invalid passwords into a matrix of how they fulfill the 4 ""contain"" requirements. requirements fulfillment table I thought that by finding the number of passwords that fit in each row excluding the first and last row, I'll have all invalid passwords and thus I can subtract that from the unrestricted password space. The first row is all valid passwords which what we are trying to find.

An evil sorcerer holds in prison an infinite number of dwarves (countably infinite). He gathers them and tells them :  Tomorrow, I will align you so that the first of you will see all the other dwarves. The second one will see all of them but the first, etc... Then, I will put a hat on each of your heads , black or white. No one can see his own hat, or the hat of those before him. But each dwarf can see the hats of those after him (they've got a good eyesight). And then, beginning with the first dwarf, I will ask each of you to tell me exactly one word, ""Black"" or ""White"" . But you will have to whisper it in my ear, so that no one else can hear it . Then, when it's done (the sorcerer is quite fast) I'll release the dwarves who rightly guess the color of their hat and keep the rest imprisonned. The dwarves gather after the meeting, and they find a strategy so that only a finite number stay imprisonned . What did they decide? P.S : There is no trick.

(Note that in the first summation the upper index is in general independent of $c$.) Ideas or reference suggestions are certainly appreciated. Thanks in advance! Update I can prove the identity \begin{eqnarray} \sum_{k = 0}^{c-1} \left \lfloor \frac{x - kb}{c} \right \rfloor = d \left \lfloor \frac{x}{d} \right \rfloor - \frac{(b+1)(c-1)}{2} + \frac{d-1}{2}, \end{eqnarray} where $d = \text{gcd}(b,c)$. There is another identity which might be useful. If $n = c \ell +r$ with $0 \leq r < c$, then \begin{eqnarray} \sum_{k = 1}^{n} \left \lfloor \frac{k}{c} \right \rfloor = c \binom{\ell}{2} + (r + 1) \ell. \end{eqnarray} Update 2 Ok, so I can prove that for real $x, y > 0$, \begin{eqnarray} \sum_{k = 0}^{\lfloor y \rfloor} \left \lfloor x + \frac{k}{y} \right \rfloor = \lfloor xy + (\lceil y \rceil - y) \lfloor x + 1 \rfloor \rfloor + \chi_{\mathbb{N}}(y)(\lfloor x \rfloor + 1), \end{eqnarray} where $\chi_{\mathbb{N}}$ denotes the characteristic function of the positive integers. My original problem (and a nice generalization of it) will be in hand if I can evaluate the following minor generalization: For real $x, y  > 0$ and $n \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$, \begin{eqnarray} \sum_{k = 0}^{n} \left \lfloor x + \frac{k}{y} \right \rfloor. \end{eqnarray} Again, any help is certainly appreciated!",,"['combinatorics', 'reference-request']"

I picked up a copy of Brualdi's Combinatorics, and while browsing the section on counting sequences I found a nice little puzzle that has definitely puzzled me. Let $m$ and $n$ be nonnegative integers with $n\geq m$. There are $m+n$ people in line to get into a theater for which admission if $50$ cents. Of the $m+n$ people, $n$ have a $50$-cent piece and $m$ have a $\$ 1$ dollar bill. The box offices opens with an empty cash register. Show that the number of ways the people can line up so that change is available when needed is   $$ \frac{n-m+1}{n+1}\binom{m+n}{m}. $$ I first noted that the first person to enter must be one of the $n$ with a half-dollar. Now the register has a half-dollar change. The second person can be either a person with a half-dollar or a dollar. In the first case, the register will now have two half-dollars, in the second case, the register will now have one dollar bill. So it seems to me that when one of the $n$ people with a half-dollar enters, the number of half-dollars in the register increases by $1$, and when one of the $m$ people with a bill enters, the number of half-dollars decreases by $1$ but the number of bills increases by $1$. I tried to model this by looking at paths in $\mathbb{Z}^2$. The $x$-axis is like the number of half-dollars, and the $y$-axis is the number of bills. You start at $(0,0)$, and you can take steps forward $(1,0)$ or backwards diagonally $(-1,1)$ corresponding to who enters, but you must always stay in the first quadrant of the plane without crossing over the axes. The goal is to make $m+n$ moves, and I figured maybe the number of such paths is counted by $\frac{n-m+1}{n+1}\binom{m+n}{m}$, but I'm not sure how to show this.

And if counting with negative ways and negative elements is possible, why can't we check how many negative ways there are of choosing $r$ elements, for example $\binom{4}{-3}$?",,"['combinatorics', 'binomial-coefficients']"

98,"Error in solution of Peter Winkler ""red and blue dice"" puzzle?","Error in solution of Peter Winkler ""red and blue dice"" puzzle?",,"This question relates to the solution give in Peter Winkler's Mathematical Mind-Benders to the ""Red and Blue Dice"" problem appearing on page $23.$ You have two sets (one red, one blue) of $n\ n-$ sided dice, each die labeled with the numbers from $1$ to $n.$ You roll all $2n$ dice simultaneously. Prove that there must be a nonempty subset of the red dice and a nonempty subset of the blue dice with the same sum! I tried to prove it by induction.  There must be an $n$ rolled or we can remove one die of each color and get a counterexample to the $n-1$ case.  If there is only on $n$ rolled, we can remove it, and any die of the other color, and again get a counterexample.  So there are at least two red $n$ 's, say. But I couldn't carry the induction idea any further.  I proved it up to $n=6,$ hoping to spot a pattern, but all I got was a collection of ad hoc arguments.  After several days, I gave up and looked at the answer. A solution is given on pages $33-34.$ Winkler advises proving a stronger statement. In fact, there is a much stronger statement than the one you were asked to prove, which is nonetheless still true.  Organize the red dice into a line, in any way you want, and do the same with the blue dice.  Then there is a contiguous nonempty subset of each line with the same sum. To put it more mathematically, given any two vector $\langle a_1,\dots,a_n\rangle$ and $\langle b_1,\dots,b_n\rangle$ in $\{1,\dots,n\}^n,$ there are $j\le k$ and $s\le t$ such that $\sum_{i=j}^k{a_i}=\sum_{i=s}^t{b_i}.$ To see this, let $\alpha_m$ be the sum of the first $m\ a_i$ 's and let $\beta_m$ be the sum of the first $m\ b_i$ 's.  Assume that $\alpha_n\le\beta_n$ (otherwise we can switch the roles of the $a$ 's and $b$ 's), and for each $m,$ let $m'$ be the greatest index for which $\beta_{m'}\le\alpha_m.$ Winkler gives a diagram with two sample strings, lines joining $a_m$ and $b_{m'}$ labeled by $\alpha_m-\beta_{m'}$ It is apparent that the $a_i$ are the dice on top and the $b_i$ those on bottom.  Note that we have $\alpha_6=22,\ \beta_6=18,$ contradicting $\alpha_n\le\beta_n,$ so I imagine that the latter was a typo.  Also, the line labeled $3$ joining $a_3$ and $b_4$ should really end at $b_5$ and be labeled $0,$ but I guess this is just a mistake. Anyway, Winkler says, We always have $\alpha_m-\beta_{m'}\ge0,$ and at most $n-1$ (if $\alpha_m-\beta_{m'}$ were larger than or equal to $n,\ m'$ would have been a larger index.) He then goes on to observe that if any of the labels is $0$ we are done, so we have $n$ labels from $1$ to $n-1$ and two are equal.  Then the sum of the intervening dice must be the same.  For example, in the picture we have two lines labeled $2,$ and we have $6+5+3=3+2+3+6.$ It seems to me that there are two holes in this proof.  The first is in the statement that the labels must be less than $n$ .  Suppose that $\alpha_n-\beta_n\ge n.$ Then $n'=n,$ and there is no larger index available.  Then  perhaps $\alpha_n\le\beta_n$ is right after all, and the diagram is wrong. But this leaves the second problem, which doesn't depend on the relation between $\alpha_n$ and $\beta_n.$ Suppose that $a_1<b_1.$ How is $1'$ to be defined? I thought about abandoning the stronger statement, and attempting to solve the puzzle by arranging the $a_i$ in decreasing order and the $b_i$ in increasing order, but I don't see how to dispose of the case $\max{a_i}>\min{b_i}.$ Winkler's argument can't be applied, and I don't see how to dispose of it otherwise. I haven't been able to rescue this proof.  Am I overlooking something?  Can you solve the puzzle? Note: Winkler say that some similar results can be found in a paper by Diaconis, Graham, and Sturmfels.  I haven't tried to read the paper yet, but it looks a little heavy for the solution to a puzzle. Also, Winkler says that the source of the puzzle was David Kempe of USC, ""who needed the result in a computer science paper,"" but gives no further reference. P.S.
