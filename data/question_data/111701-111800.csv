I know that $Spin(2) \simeq SO(2) \simeq \mathbb{S}^1$, and I have the exact sequence $$0 \rightarrow Spin(2) \rightarrow Spin^c(2) \rightarrow \mathbb{S}^1 \rightarrow 0,$$ where the first (non-trivial) map is given by inclusion and the second by the covering, so from this, going to homotopy, I get $$0 \rightarrow \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \pi_1(Spin^c(2)) \rightarrow \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow 0,$$ and this sequence splits, so it should be the case that $\pi_1(Spin^c(2)) = \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}$.

4,Group theoretic lemma about the extension of homomorphisms of profinite groups,Group theoretic lemma about the extension of homomorphisms of profinite groups,,"I have a question about a group-theoretic lemma proven in Galois Groups and Fundamental Groups by Tamas Szamuely. Suppose we have a profinite group $\Gamma$, a closed normal subgroup $N \subset \Gamma$ and a finite group $G$. Let $n \in N, \sigma \in \Gamma, g \in G$ . We have a left action on $Hom(N,G)$ (the set of continuous homomorphisms $N \rightarrow G$) of $G$ by conjugation, i.e. $g \cdot \phi(n) = g \phi(n) g^{-1}$ and a right action of $\Gamma$ by $(\phi \cdot \sigma)(n) = \phi(\sigma n \sigma^{-1})$. This two actions commute, $g \cdot (\phi\cdot \sigma) = (g \cdot \phi) \cdot \sigma$. Now, in this book there's a lemma saying that if $S \subset Hom(N,G)$ is stable under the actions of $G$ and $\Gamma$ and $G$ acts freely and transitively on $S$, then every $\phi\in S$ extends to a continuous homomorphism $\widehat{\phi}:\Gamma \rightarrow G$. The author proves this by making a homomorphism by noting that $\forall \sigma \in \Gamma$ there exists a unique $g_\sigma \in G$ such that $\phi(\sigma n \sigma^{-1}) = g_\sigma \phi(n) g_{\sigma^{-1}}$ due to the fact that $S$ is stable under $G$ and $G$ acts freely and transitively on $S$. Naturally he puts $\widehat{\phi}(\sigma) = g_\sigma$ and he proves that this is a continuous extension of $\phi$. Now, I understand that it's an extension of $\phi$, but I don't understand why it's continuous. The author claims that it's enough to prove that $\ker(\widehat{\phi})$ is open (which I understand). He then goes on saying that $\ker(\widehat{\phi})$ consists of those $\sigma \in \Gamma$ that fix $\phi$ (which I also understand), but then he says that this is open due to the continuity of $\phi$. Why is that ? Any help would be appreciated. Edit: I know that if I can prove that the right action of $\Gamma$ on $Hom(N,G)$ (with the discrete topology) is continuous, the continuity of $\widehat{\phi}$ follows since $ker(\widehat{\phi}) = Stab(\phi)$ and this is open iff the action of $\Gamma$ is continuous.

This is the only thing I need to prove, the other cases fulfill the inequality easily. Is this a known problem? Maybe the inequality is false, but I already know from a proven result that it cannot be far off. Here are some ideas I had: I tried to do an induction: Assuming more than half gets reduced in both, them we can use induction hypothesis on $v_1u_2^{-1}$ to see that one of them is not reduced more than half. Lets assume $v_1$ gets completely absorbed. How would I know what $u_1$ does to the rest of $u_2^{-1}$ ? The problem is that even if a commutator gets eaten completely, it wasn't necessarily a full commutator when we made the other commutator, $$ [a,b][b,[b^{-1},a]]=[a,b]\underbrace{b^{-1}[b^{-1},}_{\text{gets eaten}}a]^{-1}b[b^{-1}a]=a^{-1}b^{-1}abb^{-1}a^{-1}bab^{-1}b[b^{-1},a]=\underbrace{b^{-1}}_{\text{part of }[b^{-1},a]^{-1}}b[b^{-1},a]$$ What I mean is that a commutator gets cancelled without explicitly looking like a commutator in the other word, which makes things more complicated. If we have equality, as in my example, then we probably get another commutator again. The idea is to ultimately show that iterated commutator can't generate elements shorter than an iterated commutator (assuming they have to contain a certain number of generators).

Similar idea for $ 6 \circ_3 SU(3)_{irr} $ having two components. Here $ N $ denotes normalizer. Recall that a positive dimensional (type I and type III above) maximal subgroup of a simple Lie group equals the full normalizer of its identity component. https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0605784.pdf classifies all maximal closed subgroups of $ SU(n) $ whose identity component is not simple (here trivial counts as simple). According to table 5 the maximal closed subgroups of $ SU(4) $ of this type are: The normalizer of the maximal torus (row 4 table 5, $ \ell=6, p=1 $ ) $$  N(T)=S(U(1) \times U(1) \times U(1) \times U(1)) \rtimes S_6 $$ and (row 4 of table 5, $ \ell=3, p=2 $ ) $$ S( U(2) \times U(2) \times U(2) ) \rtimes S_3 $$ As well as (row 1 table 5, $ p=5,q=1 $ ) $$ S(U(5) \times U(1) )\cong U(5)  $$ and (row 1 table 5, $ p=4,q=2 $ ) $$ S(U(4) \times U(2) )  $$ and the normalizer of $ S(U(3) \times U(3))= \{\begin{bmatrix} A & 0 \\ 0 & B \end{bmatrix}:A,B\in U(3),det(A)det(B)=1 \} $ which is a split extension (row 1 table 5 $ p=q=3 $ ) $$ < S(U(3) \times U(3)),SWAP_{\oplus}> \cong S(U(3) \times U(3)) \rtimes S_2 $$ where the normalizing matrix $ SWAP_{\oplus}=\begin{bmatrix}  0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 &  0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} $ swaps the two blocks in the direct sum. Next, we consider maximal closed subgroups with nontrivial simple connected component. By dimension, such a subgroup would be isogeneous to $ SU(2),SU(3),Sp(2), G_2, SU(4), SO(7), Sp(3), SU(5), SO(8) $ of dimensions $ 3,8,10,14,21,21,24,28 $ respectively. Of these the only one with 6d irreps are: 6d irrep of $ SU(2) $ , the $ (2,0) $ 6d  irrep of $ SU(3) $ , fundamental irrep of $ Sp(3) $ , Of these only $$ 6 \circ_2 Sp(2)=<\zeta_6 I,Sp(3)> $$ is maximal subgroup of $ SU(6) $ . Even dimensional irreps of $ SU(2) $ are always symplectic so all $ SU(2) $ subgroups of $ SU(6) $ are contained in a conjugate of $ Sp(3) $ . See Understanding the 4 dimensional irrep of $ SU_2 $ Finally we consider subgroups with trivial connected component. These are finite since $ SU(6) $ is compact. To be maximal they must at least be primitive. For example there is a very large $ 6 \circ_2 2.J_2 $ subgroup of $ SU(6) $ but it is not maximal because it is not even Lie primitive: it is contained in $ 6 \circ_2 Sp(3) $ . Also there is an $ A_7 $ subgroup that is not Lie primitive, it is contained in $ SO(6) $ since it is the standard $ A_{n+1} $ subgroup of $ SO(n) $ arising from the deleted permutation representation. Even Lie primitive subgroups may not be maximal if they are contained in another larger Lie primitive finite subgroup. For example there is a subgroup $ 3.A_7 \subset 6.PSU(4,3) \subset SU(6)  $ which is Lie primitive but not maximal. A maximal finite subgroup which is irreducible in the adjoint representation is always a maximal closed subgroup. This includes the following subgroups The central product $$ 6.A_7 $$ of order $ 6(2,520)=15,120 $ (maximal closed since it is maximal finite and a 2-design) $$ 6.PSL(3,4).2_1 $$ of order $ 6(20,160)2 $ (maximal closed since it is maximal finite and a 3-design). $$ 6_1.PSU(4,3).2_2 $$ of order $ 6(3,265,920)2 $ (maximal closed since it is maximal finite and a 3-design).

Since there aren't solutions available, I was hoping someone here could look over and critique my solutions. The problem is: Define $f: \mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{R}) \to \mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{R})$ by $f(A) = \left(A^t\right)^{-1}$ . Show that $f$ is an automorphism, but not an inner automorphism for $n \geq 1$ . Here is my attempt. We first show that $f$ is a homomorphism. Given $A,B \in \mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{R})$ , we have that \begin{align*} f(AB) = \left[\left(AB\right)^t\right]^{-1} = \left(B^t A^t\right)^{-1} = \left(A^t\right)^{-1} \left(B^t\right)^{-1} = f(A) f(B), \end{align*} as desired. Second, given $A,B \in \mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{R})$ for which $f(A) = f(B)$ , we have $\left(A^t\right)^{-1} = \left(B^t\right)^{-1}$ , so $A^t = B^t$ since inverses are unique. Transposing both sides, we obtain $A = B$ , so $f$ is injective. Finally, given $A \in \mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{R})$ , consider $B = \left(A^{-1}\right)^t$ . Since $A$ is invertible, $A^{-1}$ exists and is itself invertible, and since $\det \left(A^{-1}\right) = \det\left(A^{-1}\right)^t$ , we have $\left(A^{-1}\right)^t \in \mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{R})$ . We then have \begin{align*} f\left(B\right) = \left(B^t\right)^{-1} = \left[\left(\left(A^{-1}\right)^t\right)^t\right]^{-1} = \left(A^{-1}\right)^{-1} = A, \end{align*} so $f$ is surjective and hence bijective, so $f$ is an automorphism of $\mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{R})$ . Now suppose for the sake of contradiction that for every $n \geq 1$ , $f$ is an inner automorphism, so given such an $n$ , there exists a $B \in \mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{R})$ such that $f(A) = BAB^{-1}$ . But let $\lambda \neq 0,1$ and consider $A = \lambda I$ . Since $\lambda \neq 0$ , $A \in \mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{R})$ . Furthermore, $\lambda I \in Z\left(\mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{R})\right) \subset \mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{R})$ , we have \begin{align*} BAB^{-1} = A\left(BB^{-1}\right) = AI = A, \end{align*} but $f(A) = A^{-1}$ , though $A^{-1} \neq A$ since $\frac{1}{\lambda} I \neq I$ for any $\lambda \neq 1$ , so we have reached a contradiction. The way that I derived $A = \lambda I$ is that I was looking for a matrix, generally, for which $A \neq A^{-1}$ , i.e., $A^2 \neq I$ , and this was the cleanest way to get a counterexample for every natural number $n$ .

Or equivalently, the vector space $(\mathcal{P}(X),\Delta)$ where $\mathcal{P}(X)$ is the power set and $\Delta$ is symmetric difference with bilinear form $|A\cap B|\bmod 2$ , then consider $X^{\perp}/X$ . This is a $6$ -dim vector space with subset $Q=\binom{X}{4}$ of unordered quadruples (mod complement) with $\frac{1}{2}\binom{8}{4}=35$ elements. The action of $S_8$ on $X$ induces one on $Q$ . On the other hand, the set of $2$ -subspaces of $\mathbb{F}_2^4$ , i.e. the Grassmanian $\mathrm{Gr}_2(\mathbb{F}_2^4)$ , also has $35$ elements, it presumably has some kind of embedding in $\Lambda^2\mathbb{F}_2^4$ (which mods by $x\wedge x=0$ , so is $6$ -dim spanned by $e_i\wedge e_j$ ), the projectivized form is called the Klein quadric (which is presumably the same because $\mathbb{F}_2$ ), and carries an action of $\mathrm{PGL}_2(\mathbb{F}_2)$ (which is the same thing as $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{F}_2$ ) and $\mathrm{GL}_4(\mathbb{F}_2)$ and $\mathrm{SL}_4(\mathbb{F}_4)$ because again, $\mathbb{F}_2$ ). Supposedly there is a bijection $Q\leftrightarrow\mathrm{Gr}_2(\mathbb{F}_2^4)$ which makes the action of $A_8$ and $\mathrm{PSL}_4(\mathbb{F}_2)$ match, but I'm not seeing what it's supposed to be. What is this bijection, or in other words how is $\mathbb{F}_2^4$ related to $X$ ? Presumably there is some kind of functorial construction of $\mathbb{F}_2^4$ out of $X$ or vice-versa. Or are some arbitrary choices necessary? From there, maybe I can see how $X=\mathbb{P}(\mathbb{F}_7)$ makes $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{F}_7)$ relevant, and what the planes and lines business is in the so-called Klein correspondence. Also - why $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{F}_7)$ not $\mathrm{PGL}_2(\mathbb{F}_7)$ ? Why $A_8$ not $S_8$ ? Also curious if $\mathrm{Aff}_3(\mathbb{F}_2)=\mathbb{F}_2^3\rtimes\mathrm{GL}_3(\mathbb{F}_2)$ fits in somewhere, since it is a subgroup of both $S_8$ (with $X=\mathbb{F}_2^3$ ) and $\mathrm{PGL}_4(\mathbb{F}_2)$ . Edit. Some further thoughts. Given a six-element set $Y$ , we can take $Y^{\perp}/Y$ from $(\mathcal{P}(Y),\Delta)$ to get $S_6\to\mathrm{Sp}_4(\mathbb{F}_2)$ (with some set-theoretic skew form I can't remember), which is an isomorphism. We can embed $S_6$ in $A_8$ (multiply the odd elements of $S_6$ by $(78)$ ) and try to extend the action to $X^{\perp}/X$ , but it doesn't seem like $Y^{\perp}/Y$ embeds naturally into it in the first place. The sum $1+28+35$ seems to show up in places. First off, in the sizes of the $S_8$ -orbits of $X^{\perp}/X$ , in which case the sum is $\binom{8}{0}+\binom{8}{2}+\frac{1}{2}\binom{8}{2}$ . Secondly, it appears in the $\mathrm{GL}_4(\mathbb{F}_2)$ -orbits of $\Lambda^2\mathbb{F}_2^4$ , comprised of elements of the form $a\wedge b+c\wedge d$ and $a\wedge b$ . Thirdly for some reason it seems to show up in $\mathfrak{h}_3(\mathbb{F}_2)$ , the $3\times 3$ Hermitian matrices over $\mathbb{F}_2$ , as those nonzero elements with determinant $0$ or $1$ (so, presumably as the $\mathrm{GL}_3(\mathbb{F}_2)$ -orbits). I can detail how I calculated the sizes of all these orbits if someone wants. Is there some relationship between $\mathfrak{h}_3(\mathbb{F}_2)$ and $\Lambda^2\mathbb{F}_2^4$ ? Note $\Lambda^2\mathbb{F}_2^4$ naturally coincides with the diagonal-free $4\times4$ Hermitian matrices, say $\mathfrak{h}_4'(\mathbb{F}_2)$ ; is there a relationship between $\mathfrak{h}_3(\mathbb{F}_2)$ and $\mathfrak{h}_4'(\mathbb{F}_2)$ ? I imagine if there is, it has something to do with the exceptional homomorphism $\mathrm{SO}_4\to\mathrm{SO}_3$ . (Note Hermitian and skew-Hermitian are equivalent over $\mathbb{F}_2$ ). There is a Hodge-star operator $\ast$ on $\Lambda^2\mathbb{F}_2^4$ ; on $\mathrm{Gr}_2(\mathbb{F}_2^4)$ it replaces a $2$ -subspace with its orthogonal complement. There are three $2$ -subspaces which are fixed points, $\mathrm{span}\{e_i+e_j,e_k+e_\ell\}$ for the three partitions $\{\{i,j\},\{k,\ell\}\}$ of $\{1,2,3,4\}$ .

Then $K_2(F)$ is a direct summand of $K_2F(t)$ . $\text{ }$ I find it quite difficult to understand the argument, so I hope I can get some help from here. His goal is to construct an inverse map $\lambda: K_2 F(t)\to K_2(F)$ to the natural map $K_2(F)\to K_2 F(t)$ . Make the following definitions $$f(t)=\frac{a_0t^n+\cdots + a_n}{b_0t^m+\cdots+ b_m},$$ $\operatorname{lead}(f):=\frac{a_0}{b_0}$ and $\lambda(\{f,g\})=\{\operatorname{lead}(f),\operatorname{lead}(g)\}$ . Now he says that we may check the representation of Matsumoto's Theorem, to show that $\lambda$ is a homomorphism. We begin to show bilinearity. Let $f,f',g\in F(t)^\times$ then $$\lambda(\{f,g\}\{f',g\})=\lambda(\{ff',g\})=\{\operatorname{lead}(ff'),g\}=\{\operatorname{lead}(f)\operatorname{lead}(f'),g\}=\{\operatorname{lead}(f),g\}\{\operatorname{lead}(f'),g\}=\lambda(\{f,g\})\lambda(\{f',g\}).$$ By symmetry, the same argument works if we consider something like $\lambda(\{f,g\}\{f,g'\})$ instead. Let us now see that the Steinberg identity is, also, satisfied. Consider $f\in F(t)^\times$ and assume $m<n$ , then we have that $\operatorname{lead}(1-f)=-\operatorname{lead}(f)$ , since $$1-\frac{a_0t^n+\cdots a_{n-m}t^{m}+\cdots + a_n}{b_0t^m+\cdots + b_m}=\frac{b_0t^m+\cdots + b_m}{b_0t^m+\cdots + b_m}-\frac{a_0t^n+\cdots a_{n-m}t^{m}+\cdots + a_n}{b_0t^m+\cdots + b_m}=\frac{-(a_0t^n+\cdots a_{n-(m+1)}t^{m+1})+(b_m-a_{n-m})t^{m}+\cdots + (b_m-a_n)}{b_0t^m+\cdots + b_m},$$ and so $\operatorname{lead}(1-f)=-\operatorname{lead}(f)$ . It was showed earlier in the book that $\{x,-x\}=1$ for every $x\in E^\times$ , where $E$ is some field. Thus $\{\operatorname{lead}(f),\operatorname{lead}(1-f)\}=\{\operatorname{lead}(f),-\operatorname{lead}(f)\}=1$ . One can also show by similar reasoning that $\{\operatorname{lead}(f),\operatorname{lead}(1-f)\}=\{\operatorname{lead}(f),1-\operatorname{lead}(f)\}=1$ if $n=m$ and that $\{\operatorname{lead}(f),\operatorname{lead}(1-f)\}=\{\operatorname{lead}(f),1\}$ if $n<m$ . Lastly, they say that since $K_2$ commutes with filtered colimits, it follows that $K_2(F)$ injects into $K_2F(T)$ for every purely transcendental extension $F(T)$ of $F$ . Questions: Why does checking the criteria for Matsuomoto's Theorem prove that $\lambda$ is a homomorphism? Don't we want to pick symbols $\{f,g\},\{f',g'\}$ and check that it is a group homomorphism: $$\lambda(\{f,g\}\{f',g'\})=\lambda(\{f,g\})\lambda(\{f',g'\})?$$ By checking Matsumoto's Theorem don't we just make sure that we map elements from $K_2F(t)$ to $K_2(F)$ ? Why does the following equality hold $\{\operatorname{lead}(f),1\}=1$ ? How comes that the last paragraph implies that $K_2(F)$ injects into $K_2F(T)$ ? I don't really understand why $K_2$ commutes with filtered colimits but if I take it for granted for the moment, why does it prove the fact? Lastly, why does showing that $K_2(F)\to K_2 F(T)$ is injective show that $K_2(F)$ is a direct summand of $K_2F(t)$ ? The answers are maybe/probably easy, but I am quite confused right now, new to $K$ -theory and I don't manage to figure it out.

I wonder if every generator of $Z({\rm Spin}_n^{\epsilon}(q))$ is a square element in ${\rm Spin}_n^{\epsilon}(q)$ ? B. When $Z(\Omega_{2m}^{\epsilon}(q))\cong C_2$ , is the generator of $Z(\Omega_{2m}^{\epsilon}(q))$ a square element in $\Omega_{2m}^{\epsilon}(q)$ ？ Note. Here the ground field is a finite field $F_q$ with $q$ a power of some odd prime $p$ . The following follows from 'simple groups of Lie type' by Roger W. Carter. A Lie algebra is a vector space $L$ over a field $K$ on which a product operation $[xy]$ is defined satisfying the following axioms: (i) $[xy]$ is bilinear for $x, y\in L$ . (ii) $[xx]=0$ for $x\in L$ . (iii) $[[xy]z]+[[yz]x]+[[zx]y]=0$ for $x, y, z\in L$ . for each element $x$ of a Lie algebra $L$ we define a map ${\rm ad}~x$ of $L$ into itself by $${\rm ad}~x.y=[xy],~~~y\in L.$$ For each $x,y\in L$ we define the scalar product $(x,y)=tr(ad~x.ad~y)$ , which is called the Killing form. The dimension of the Cartan subalgebras $H$ of $L$ is called the rank of $L$ , and will usually be denoted by $l$ . Although the roots are defined as elements of the dual space of $H$ they can, by considering the Killing form, be regarded as elements of $H$ itself. Each element of the dual space of $H$ is expressible in the form $h\rightarrow (x, h)$ for a unique element $x\in H$ . The element $x$ is associated with the map $h\rightarrow r(h)$ may be identified with the root $r$ . Thus $r$ can be regarded either as an element of $H$ or an element of its dual space; the relation between these two being given by $$r(h)=(r, h),~~~h\in H.$$ We now define the Dynkin diagram of the Lie algebra $L$ . This is a graph with $l$ nodes, one associated with each fundamental root $p_i$ , such that the $i$ th node is joined to the $j$ th node by a bond of strength $n_{ij}$ . Let $L$ be a Lie algebra over a field of characteristic $0$ and $\delta$ be a derivation of $L$ which is nilpotent, i.e. satisfies $\delta^n=0$ for some $n$ . Then $${\rm exp}~\delta=1+\delta+\frac{\delta^2}{2!}+...+\frac{\delta^{n-1}}{(n-1)!}$$ is an sutomorphism of $L$ . We write $x_r(\zeta)={\rm exp}(\zeta ad~e_r)$ for $\zeta\in \mathbb{C}$ . We shall write $h_r$ for $\bar{h}_r$ , $e_r$ for $\bar{e}_r$ , $x_r(t)$ for $\bar{x}_r(t)$ , and $A_r(t)$ for $\bar{A}_r(t)$ . This omission of the bars will not lead to confusion or inconsistency since the objects originaly called $h_r$ , $e_r$ , $x_r(t)$ , $A_r(t)$ are special cases of $\bar{h}_r$ , $\bar{e}_r$ , $\bar{x}_r(t)$ , $\bar{A}_r(t)$ when $K=\mathbb{C}$ . The Chevalley group of type $L$ over the field $K$ , denoted by $L(K)$ , is defined to be the group of automorphisms of the Lie algebra $L_K$ generated by the $x_r(t)$ for all $r\in \Phi$ , $t\in K$ . We now consider the special case in which the base field $K$ is the finite field $GF(q)$ with $q$ elements, where $q$ is an arbitrary prime power. $G$ is then a group of non-singular linear transformations of a space over a finite field, so is a finite group. The Chevalley group of  type $L$ over $GF(q)$ will be denoted by $L(q)$ . Theorem 12.1.1 Let $L$ be a simple Lie algebra with $L\neq A_1$ and let $K$ be a field. For each root $r$ of $L$ and each element $t$ of $K$ introduce a symbol $\bar{x}_r(t)$ . Let $\bar{G}$ be the abstract group generated by the elements $\bar{x}_r(t)$ subject to relations $$\bar{x}_r(t_1)\bar{x}_r(t_1)=\bar{x}_r(t_1+t_2),$$ $$[\bar{x}_s(u),\bar{x}_r(t)]=\prod_{i,j>0}\bar{x}_{ir+js}(C_{ijrs}(-t)^iu^j),$$ $$\bar{h}_r(t_1)\bar{h}_r(t_2)=\bar{h}_r(t_1t_2),~~~t_1t_2\neq 0,$$ and $$\bar{n}_r(t)=\bar{x}_r(t)\bar{x}_{-r}(-t^{-1})\bar{x}_{r}{(t)}.$$ Let $\bar{Z}$ be the centre of $\bar{G}$ . Then $\bar{G}/{\bar{Z}}$ is isomorphic to the Chevalley group $G=L(K)$ . The following notations and consequces are followed from 'Classical groups and geometric algebra' by Larry C. Grove. A bilinear form on $V$ is a function $B: V\times V\rightarrow F$ that becomes a linear fouctional in either variable if the other variable is fixed. Suppose that $B$ is a bilinear form on $V$ . Say that $B$ is symmetric if $B(v,w)=B(w,v)$ for all $v,w\in V$ . Suppose that $B_1,B_2$ are bilinear forms on spaces $V_1$ , $V_2$ , respectively. An isometry relative to $B_1$ and $B_2$ is an $F$ -isomorphism $\sigma: V_1\rightarrow V_2$ satisfying $B_2(\sigma v,\sigma w)=B_1(v,w)$ for all $v, w\in V_1$ . If $B$ is a symmetric form on $V$ define $Q: V\rightarrow F$ via $Q(v)=B(v,v)$ , and call $Q$ the associated quadratic form. Through this chapter we assume that $V$ is a quadratic space of dimension $n\geq 2$ over a filed $F$ , with ${\rm char}~F\neq 2$ . The isometries of $V$ are called orthogonal (linear) transformations; they comprise the orthogonal group $O(V)$ . Thus $$O(V)=\{\tau\in {\rm GL}(V): B(\tau u,\tau v)=B(u,v),~{\rm all} u,v\in V\}\leq {\rm GL}(V).$$ Equivalently $\tau\in O(V)$ if and only if $Q(\tau v)=Q(v)$ , all $v\in V.$ If ${\rm det}~\tau=1$ call $\tau$ a rotation, or a proper orthogonal transformation. If ${\rm det}~\tau=-1$ call $\tau$ a reversion, or (more commonly) an improper orthogonal transformation. The rotations in $O(V)$ form a subgroup which will be denoted $SO(V)$ , called the special orthogonal group-it is often denoted by $O^+(V)$ or $O_+(V)$ in the leterature. Let $u\in V$ be any nonzero anisotropic vector (i.e. $Q(u)\neq 0$ ) and define a linear transformation $\sigma_u$ via $$\sigma_u(v)=v-2\frac{B(v,u)}{Q(u)}\cdot u$$ for all $v\in V$ . Then $$B(\sigma_uv,\sigma_uw)=B(v,w),$$ so $\sigma_u\in O(V)$ . We call $\sigma_u$ the (orthogonal) reflection along $u$ or through the hyperplane $u^{\perp}$ . Often in literature $\sigma_u$ is called a symmetry, e.g. by Arin in [3]. If $B$ is a symmetric form on $V$ , with quadratic form $Q$ , then $v\in V$ , $v\neq 0$ , is called isotropic if $Q(v)=0$ , anisotropic if $Q(v)\neq 0$ . For convenience, $v=0$ is taken to be anisotropic, even though $Q(0)=0$ . If there exists an isotropic vector then $B$ and $V$ (and $Q$ ) are called isotropic; otherwise they are anisotropic. The dimension $m$ of a maximal totally isotropic subspace of a quadratic space $V$ is called the Witt index of $V$ ; it is denoted varioulsy as $m(V)$ , or $m(B)$ , or $m(Q)$ , or sometimes in the literature by ${\rm ind}(V)$ , etc. Suppose that $A$ is an (associative) $F$ -algebra with $1$ . Say that $A$ is compatible with the quadratic $Q$ on $V$ if there is a linear transformation $\varphi: V\rightarrow A$ such that $\varphi(v)^2=Q(v).1_A$ for all $v\in V$ . Proposition 8.3. Suppose $A$ is compatible with $Q$ via $\varphi$ and $0\neq v\in V$ . Then $\varphi v$ is unit in $A$ if and only if $v$ is anisotropic in $V$ A Clifford algebra for a quadratic space $V$ is an associative algebra $C$ (with 1) that is compatible with the quadratic form $Q$ of $V$ , via a map $\epsilon: V\rightarrow C$ , and such that give any algebra $A$ compatible with $V$ (i.e. with $Q$ ) via $\varphi: V\rightarrow A$ , then there exists a unique algebra homomorphism $\hat{\varphi}:C\rightarrow A$ so that the diagram $$\epsilon: V\rightarrow C, \varphi: V\rightarrow A, \hat{\varphi}: C\rightarrow A$$ is commutative. The decomposition $C=C_0\oplus C_1$ of the Clifford algebra determines a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ -grading of $C$ . Note that $F\subseteq C_0$ and $V\subseteq C_1$ . If $r, s\in \{0, 1\}$ the $C_rC_s=C_{r+s}$ , the sum $r+s$ being taken ${\rm mod}~2$ . Thus $C_0$ is a subalgebra of $C$ (the even subalgebra); the elements of $C_0$ are called even homogeneous of degree 0, and the elements of $C_1$ are called odd homogeneous of degree 1. Proposition 8.15. If $V$ is a quadratic space there is a unique anti-automorphism $\alpha: C(V)\rightarrow C(V)$ with $\alpha_V=1_V$ . By definition there is then a unique isomorphism $\alpha: C\rightarrow C^{op}$ such that $\alpha|V=1_V$ , which means that $\alpha:C\rightarrow C$ is an anti-automorphism. Proposition 9.1. Suppose that $u_1, u_2, ..., u_k$ are nonzero anisotropic vectors in $V$ such that $\sigma_{u_1}\sigma_{u_2}...\sigma_{u_k}=1_V$ . Then $\prod_{i=1}^k Q(u_i)\in {F^{\times}}^2$ . Proposition 9.1 is the basis for an important definition. Take $\sigma\in O(V)$ . Then $\sigma$ is a product of reflections in many ways, say e.g. that $\sigma=\sigma_{u_1}...\sigma_{u_r}$ and $\sigma=\sigma_{v_1}...\sigma_{v_s}$ . Then $$\sigma_{u_1}...\sigma_{u_r}\sigma_{v_s}\sigma_{v_1}=1$$ and consequently $$Q(u_1)...Q(u_r)Q(v_s)...Q(v_1)\in {F^{\times}}^2$$ by Proposition 9.1. It follows that $Q(u_1)...Q(u_r)$ and $Q(v_1)...Q(v_s)$ lie in the same coset of ${F^{\times}}^2$ in $F^{\ast}$ , and hence determin a well-defined map $$\theta: O(V)\rightarrow F^{\ast}/{{F^\times}^2},$$ viz. $\theta(\sigma)=Q(u_1)...Q(u_r){F^{\times}}^2$ The map $\theta$ is evidently a homomorphism; it is called the spinor norm on $O(V)$ . The kernel of the restriction to $SO(V)$ of the spinor norm $\theta$ , denoted by $\mho=\mho(V)$ is called the reduced orthogonal group of $V$ (relative, of course, to the given quadratic form). Theorem 9.7. Suppose that $V$ is isotropic. Then $$\mho(V)=\Omega(V),~{\rm and}~SO(V)/\Omega\cong F^{\ast}/{{F^\times}^2}.$$ Let us sketch an alternative approach to $\theta|_{SO(V)}$ . Define the Clifford group $\Gamma=\Gamma(V)$ to be the normalizer in the group $U(C)$ of units in $C$ of the subspace $V$ of $C$ , i.e. $$\Gamma=\{x\in U(C): xvx^{-1}\in V, {\rm all}~\in V\}.$$ Define the even Clifford group to be $\Gamma_0=\Gamma\cap C_0$ . If $x\in V$ is nonzero and anisotropic, and $v\in V$ , then $xvx^{-1}=-\sigma_xv\in V$ by Proposition 8.3, so $O(V)\leq \Gamma$ . It follows easily that $SO(V)\leq \Gamma_0$ . If $x\in \Gamma$ and $v\in V$ define $\chi_x(v)=xvx^{-1}\in V$ . Then $$Q(\chi_xv)=Q(xvx^{-1})=(xvx^{-1})^2=xv^2x^{-1}=xQ(v)x^{-1}=Q(v),$$ so $\chi(x)\in O(V)$ . In fact $\chi$ is a homomorphism from $\Gamma$ into $O(V)$ , called the vector representation of $\Gamma$ . It can be shown that $\chi$ maps $\Gamma_0$ onto $SO(V)$ , with ${\rm Ker}(\chi|{\Gamma_0})=F^\ast$ . If $\alpha$ is the unique anti-automorphism of $C$ with $\alpha_V=1_V$ discussed in Proposition 8.15, then we may define a homomorphism $N: \Gamma_0\rightarrow F^{\ast}$ via $N(x)=\alpha(x)x$ . The kernel of $N$ is called the spin group ${\rm Spin}(V)$ . Then $\chi({\rm Spin}(V))=\mho(V)$ , the reduced orthogonal group. If $\sigma\in SO(V)$ , then there exists $x\in \Gamma_0$ with $\chi(x)=\sigma$ , and then $\theta(\sigma)=N(x)F^{\ast 2}$ gives the spinor norm of $\sigma$ . The following consequence follows from 'Basic algebra I' by Nathan Jacobson. Let $(e_1, e_2, ..., e_n)$ be a base for $V$ and let $\eta\in O(V,Q)$ . Then we have $B(\eta e_i, \eta e_j)=B(e_i,e_j)$ for all $i, j=1,2, ..., n.$ conversely if these conditions hold for a linear transformation $\eta$ , then for any $x=\sum a_ie_i$ we have $Q(\eta x)=Q(x)$ . Thus a linear transformation $\eta$ of $V$ into $V$ is orthogonal if and only if $$(26)~~~B(\eta e_i,\eta e_j)=B(e_i,e_j)~1\leq i, j\leq n.$$ Now let $b=(B(e_i, e_j))$ the matrix of $B$ relative to the base $(e_1,e_2,...,e_n)$ and let $\eta e_i=\sum h_{ij}e_j$ . Then the conditions (26) are that $B(\sum_k h_{ik}e_k, \sum_l h_{jl}e_l)=B(e_i,e_j)$ for all $i$ and $j$ . In matrix form these conditions are $$(27)~~~h\cdot b\cdot {}^th=b~~~{\rm for}~h=(h_{ij}).$$ An orthogonal transformation is called proper or a  rotation if ${\rm det}~h=1$ ; otherwise, the transformation is improper. If we choose an orthogonal base for $V$ , then the matrix $b$ of $B$ is diagonal. Then it is clear that any diagonal matrix with diagonal entries $1$ or $-1$ satisfies (27) and hence determines an orthogonal transformation. Moreover, this is  proper or improper according as the number of -1's is even or odd. It is clear that the set $O^+{V,Q}$ of rotations is a normal subgroup of index two in $O(V,Q)$ . If $B$ is a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form, then $B$ is called isotropic or a null form if there exists a vector $u\neq 0$ such that $B(u,u)=0$ . Such a vector is called isotropic. In the case of a finite field the Witt index is always positive if $n\geq 3$ . The following consequence follows form 'Basic algebra II' by Nathan Jacobson. Definition 4.5. Let $V$ be a vector space voer a field $F$ , $Q$ a quadratic form on $V$ . Let $T(V)=F\oplus V\oplus(V\otimes V)\oplus (V\otimes V\otimes V)\oplus ...$ be the tensor algebra defined by $V$ (p. 140) and let $K_Q$ be the ideal in $T(V)$ generated by all of the elements of the form $$(45)~~~x\otimes x-Q(x)1,~~~x\in V$$ Then we definet the Clifford algebra of the quadratic form $Q$ to be the algebra $$C(V,Q)=T(V)/{K_Q}.$$ In the remaider of this section, we shall give a brief indiction of some applications of Clifford algebras to the strudy of orthogonal groups. For this purpose, we need to introduce the even (or second) Clifford algebra $C^+(V,Q)$ defined to be the subalgebra of $C(V,Q)$ geneated by all of the products $uv$ , $u,v\in V$ (that is, by $V^2$ ). Definition 4.6. The Clifford group $\Gamma(V,Q)$ is the subgroup of invertible elements $u\in C(V,Q)$ such that $uxu^{-1}\in V$ for all $x\in V$ . Clearly this is a subgroup of the multiplicative group of invertible elements of $C(V,Q)$ . The even Clifford group is $\Gamma^+(V,Q)=\Gamma(V,Q)\cap C^+(V,Q)$ . If $x\in V$ and $u\in \Gamma=\Gamma(V,Q)$ , then $uxu^{-1}\in V$ and $(uxu^{-1})^2=ux^2u^{-1}=Q(x)1$ . Hence the linear transformation $x\mapsto uxu^{-1}$ of $V$ is in the orthogonal group $O(V,Q)$ . The map $\chi$ , where $\chi(u)$ is $x\mapsto uxu^{-1},x\in V$ , is a homomorphism of $\Gamma(V,Q)$ into $O(V,Q)$ called the vector representation of the Clifford group. Definition 4.7. The kernel of the homomorphism $N$ of $\Gamma^+$ into $F^*$ is called the spin group ${\rm Spin}(V,Q)$ . Its image $O'(V,Q)$ under the vector representation $\chi$ is called the reduced orthogonal group. If $f$ is any rotation and $\chi(u)=f$ , then $N(u){F^{*}}^2$ is called the spinorial norm of $f$ . The spinorial norm map is also a homomorphism (of $O^+(V,Q)$ into $F^*/{{F^*}^2}$ ). The spinorial norm of a rotation can be defined directly, without the intervention of the Clifford algebra. If $f$ is a given rotation, then we can write $f=S_{v_1}...S_{v_2}$ . and we can simply define the spinoial norm of f to be the coset $\prod_1^{2r}Q(v_i){F^*}^2$ . Since $\chi(v_1...v_{2r})=f$ and $N(v_1...v_{24})=\prod_1^{2r}Q(v_i)$ , this is the same element of $F^*/{{F^*}^2}$ , which we have called the spinorial norm. Now the reduced orthogonal group can also be defined as the kernel of the spinorial norm map. The reduced orthogonal group contains the commutator subgroup $\Omega$ of $O$ . Theorem 4.16. Let $Q$ be of positive Witt index. Then the reduced orthogonal group $O'(V,Q)$ coincides with the commutator subgroup $\Omega$ of $O(V,Q)$ and $$O^+(V,Q)/{O'(V,Q)}\cong F^{\ast}/{F^{\ast 2}}.$$ By 'the finite simple groups' of Robert A. Wilson, we have the following the two results: It is easy to find elements of the spin group which square to $-1$ , and hence the spin group is a proper double cover of the orthogonal group. We write ${\rm Spin}_n^{\epsilon}(q)$ for this group of shape $2.{\Omega_n^\epsilon}(q)$ . If $n$ is odd, or if $n=2m$ and $q^m\equiv -\epsilon~({\rm mod}~4)$ , then $\Omega_n^\epsilon (q)$ is already simple, and the spin group has the structure $2.\Omega_n^\epsilon (q)$ . If $n=2m$ and $q^m\equiv \epsilon~({\rm mod}~4)$ , then $\Omega_n^\epsilon(q)$ has a centre of order 2, and the spin group has the structure $4.{\rm P\Omega}_n^\epsilon (q)$ if $m$ is odd, and the structure $2^2.{\rm P\Omega}_n^\epsilon (q)$ (necessarily with $\epsilon=+$ ) is $m$ is even. The following follows from 'twisted wreath products and Sylow 2-subgroups of Classical simple groups' by Warren J. Wong. If $O_n$ is an orthogonal group in dimension $n$ over $GF(q)$ , we shall take the quadratic form on the underlying space to be fixed, so that we can define the spinor norm on the whole group $O_n$ , not just on the proper orthogonal group $O_n^{+}$ . If $K_n$ is the kernel of the spinor norm, then $K_n$ has index 2 in $O_n$ , and the intersection $K_n\cap O_n^+$ , which has index $4$ in $O_n$ , is the commuttor subgroup $\Omega_n$ of $O_n$ . First we consider the Sylow 2-subgroup of $K_{2n}$ . For $n=1$ , the group $O_2$ is dihedral, so that its Sylow $2$ -subgroup $R$ is dihedral of order $2^{t+1}$ ; $R=\langle u, v\rangle$ , where $$(23)~u^{2^t}=w^2=1, u^w=u^{-1}.$$ If $q\equiv 1(\rm mod)~4$ , we may take $$u=\begin{pmatrix}\epsilon^{-1}&0\\0&\epsilon\end{pmatrix}, w=\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\1&0\end{pmatrix},$$ where $\epsilon$ is a primitive $2^t$ -th root of 1 in $GF(q)$ If $q\equiv -1(\rm mod)~4$ , we may take $$u=\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\-b&a\end{pmatrix}, w=\begin{pmatrix}-1&0\\0&1\end{pmatrix},$$ where $a+b\sqrt{-1}$ is a primitive $2^t$ -th root of $1$ in $GF(q^2)$ . In either case, $w$ has spinor norm $1$ , being a symmetry with respect to the hyperplane (line) orthogonal to a vector on which the value of the quadratic form is a square in $GF(q)$ . Thus the Sylow $2$ -subgroup $W$ of $K_2$ contained in $R$ is $\langle u,w\rangle$ , where $v=u^2$ . This is a dihedral group of order $2^t$ : $$(24)~v^{2^t-1}=w^2=1,~v^w=v^{-1}.$$ Put $e=uw$ . Then $e$ has order $2$ , and $R=W\langle e\rangle$ . where $$(25)~v^e=v^{-1},~w^e=vw.$$ For a general value of $n$ , let the direct sum matrix of the above matrix $e$ with the identity matrix of degree $2n-2$ be again denoted as $e$ : $$(26)~\begin{pmatrix}e&0\\0&I\end{pmatrix},$$ Then $e$ is an element of order $2$ in $O_{2n}$ which is not in $K_{2n}$ . If $W$ is a Sylow $2$ -subgroup of $K_{2n}$ normalized by $e$ , and $E=\langle e\rangle$ , then te semi-direct product $WE$ is a Sylow 2-subgroup of $O_{2n}$ , and we call the natural representation $$E\rightarrow {\rm Aut}~W$$ as $s_2$ -system of $K_{2n}$ in $O_{2n}$ . We now conside the Sylow 2-subgroups of $\Omega_n$ and of $P\Omega_{2n}=\Omega_{2n}/Z$ , where the centre $Z$ of $\Omega_{2n}$ is a group of order 2 generated by $z=-I$ . For $n=1$ , take the Sylow $2$ -subgorup $R=\langle u, w\rangle$ of $O_2$ as in (23). The corresponding Sylow 2-subgroup $T$ of $\Omega_2$ is the commutator subgroup $\langle v\rangle$ of $R$ , $v=u^2$ , and $z$ is the unique element of order $2$ in $T$ . In this case, $R$ is not a split extension of $T$ . However, for $n>1$ , take $e$ as in (26) and take $$(27)~f=\begin{pmatrix}I_2&0&0\\0&w&0\\0&0&I_{2n-4}\end{pmatrix}$$ where $I_2$ and $I_{2n-4}$ are identity matrices of degrees $2$ and $2n-4$ . Then $f$ lies in $K_{2n}$ but not in $\Omega_{2n}$ , and $e$ and $f$ generate a non-cyclic group $F$ of order $4$ which meets $\Omega_{2n}$ in the identity. If now $T$ is a Sylow 2-subgroup of $\Omega_{2n}$ normalized by $F$ , then the semi-direct product $TF$ is a Sylow 2-subgroup of $O_{2n}$ , and we cal the natural representation $$F\rightarrow {\rm Aut}~T$$ an $s_2$ -system of $\Omega_{2n}$ in $O_{2n}$ . When $n=2$ , we can take $T$ to be the group generated by $$d=\begin{pmatrix}u&0\\0&u^{-1}\end{pmatrix}, g=\begin{pmatrix}u&0\\0&u\end{pmatrix}, h=\begin{pmatrix}0&I\\I&0\end{pmatrix}, k=\begin{pmatrix}0&w\\w&0\end{pmatrix},$$ where $u$ and $w$ are as before and $I$ is the identity matrix of degree 2. We have the relations $$(28)~ d^{2^{t-1}}=g^{2t-1}=z, z^2=h^2=k^2=1,$$ $$d^h=d^{-1}, g^k=g^{-1}, [d,g]=[d,k]=[h,g]=[h,k]=1,$$ so that $T$ is a central product of two dihedral groups of order $2^{t+1}$ , and $z$ is the generator of the centre of $T$ . The action of $F$ and $T$ is given by $$(29)~d^e=g^{-1}, g^e=d^{-1}, h^e=gk, k^e=dh,$$ $$d^f=g, g^f=d, h^f=k, k^f=h.$$ Theorem 10. Let $2^{t+1}$ be the great power of $2$ dividing $q^2-1$ , $F=\langle e,f\rangle$ a non-cyclic group of order $4$ , $T=\langle d, g, h, k\rangle$ the group of order $2^{2t+1}$ given by (28), $z$ the generator of the centre of $T$ , and $$\rho : F\rightarrow {\rm Aut}~T$$ the representation given by (29). Let $C=\langle a, b, c\rangle$ be an elementary Abelian group of order $8$ , $J=\{1,2\}$ and $$\varphi=(F\rightarrow {\rm Aut}~C, CF\rightarrow F\sim S_J)$$ the $r$ -system given by $$a^e=a^f=a, b^e=b^f=b, c^e=ac, c^f=bc,$$ $$a\rightarrow \begin{pmatrix}e&0\\0&e\end{pmatrix}, b\rightarrow \begin{pmatrix}f&0\\0&f\end{pmatrix}, c\rightarrow \begin{pmatrix}0&1\\1&0\end{pmatrix}, e\rightarrow \begin{pmatrix}e&0\\0&1\end{pmatrix}, f\rightarrow \begin{pmatrix}f&0\\0&1\end{pmatrix}.$$ If $n=2^m, m\geq 1$ and $M_{m-1}$ is the twisted wreath product of $m-1$ copies of $\varphi$ , then $\rho{\ast}M_{m-1}$ is equivalent with an $s_2$ -system of $\Omega_{2n}$ in $O_{2n}$ , where $O_{2n}=O_{2n}(1,q)$ , and $z\ast 1$ correpsponds to the generator of the centre of $\Omega_{2n}$ . In particular, the Sylow 2-subgroup of $\Omega_{2n}$ is isomorphic with a twisted wreath product $U$ of $T$ with $m-1$ copies of $C$ , and the Sylow 2-subgroup of $P\Omega_{2n}$ is isomorphic with $U/K$ where $K$ is genertated by $z\ast 1\ast...\ast 1$ . The following follows from 'the geometry of the classical groups' by Donald E. Taylor. If $u$ is singular and $v\in \langle u\rangle^\perp$ , we put $$\rho_{u,v}(x):=x+\beta(x,v)u-\beta(x,u)v-Q(v)\beta(x,u)u~~~(11.17)$$ and note that $\rho$ is a well-defined element of $SO(V)$ for fields of all characteristics. Moreover, if $v$ is singular, we obtain the transformation of case II whereas if $v$ is non-singular, we obtain those of case III of the previous section. Following Tamagawa (1958) and Higman (1978) we call $\rho_{u,v}$ a siegel transformation. 11.46 Theorem. If ${\rm dim}~V\geq 3$ , then Witt index of $V$ is at least $1$ , and $\Omega(V)\neq \Omega^+(4,2)$ , then $\Omega(V)$ is generated by the Siegel transformations of $V$ The following follows from 'the subgroup structure of finie classical groups' by Peter B. Kleidman and Martin W. Liebeck $P\Omega_{2m}^+(q)\cong D_m(q)$ for $m\geq 3$ . $P\Omega_{2m}^-(q)\cong {}^2D_m(q)$ for $m\geq 2$ . The following follows from 'atlas of finite groups' by John Horton Conway, R. T. CURTIS, S. P. NORTON, R. A. PARKER, R. A. WILSON and with computational assistance from J. G. THACKRAY. For a $\mathbb{C}G$ -module $V$ with irreducible character $\chi$ we have the Frobenius-Schur indicator $$\nu(\chi) = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} \chi(g^2),$$ and $\nu(\chi)$ takes one of the values {+1, -1, 0}, as $\chi$ is afforded by a real representation or is real-valued but not afforded by a real representation or is not real-valued, respectively. The following conseqences are followed by number theory and representation theory of finite groups. It is well known, and easy to derive from the orthogonality relations for group characters and properties of the Frobenius-Schur indicator $\nu$ that $z$ is a square in $G$ if and only if $$\sum_{ \chi \in {\rm Irr}(G)} \nu(\chi) \chi(z) > 0.$$ When $m$ is an even integer and $q$ a power of a odd prime, then $q^m\equiv 1~{\rm mod~4}$ . The following example is followed by using Magma. Example 1. $G=\Omega_8^+(3)$ , $3^4\equiv 1~({\rm mod}~4)$ , $Z{({\rm Spin}_8^+(3))}\cong C_2\times C_2$ . $Z(\Omega_8^+(3))\cong C_2$ .

The following follows from 'simple groups of Lie type' by Roger W. Carter. A Lie algebra is a vector space over a field on which a product operation is defined satisfying the following axioms: (i) is bilinear for . (ii) for . (iii) for . for each element of a Lie algebra we define a map of into itself by For each we define the scalar product , which is called the Killing form. The dimension of the Cartan subalgebras of is called the rank of , and will usually be denoted by . Although the roots are defined as elements of the dual space of they can, by considering the Killing form, be regarded as elements of itself. Each element of the dual space of is expressible in the form for a unique element . The element is associated with the map may be identified with the root . Thus can be regarded either as an element of or an element of its dual space; the relation between these two being given by We now define the Dynkin diagram of the Lie algebra . This is a graph with nodes, one associated with each fundamental root , such that the th node is joined to the th node by a bond of strength . Let be a Lie algebra over a field of characteristic and be a derivation of which is nilpotent, i.e. satisfies for some . Then is an sutomorphism of . We write for . We shall write for , for , for , and for . This omission of the bars will not lead to confusion or inconsistency since the objects originaly called , , , are special cases of , , , when . The Chevalley group of type over the field , denoted by , is defined to be the group of automorphisms of the Lie algebra generated by the for all , . We now consider the special case in which the base field is the finite field with elements, where is an arbitrary prime power. is then a group of non-singular linear transformations of a space over a finite field, so is a finite group. The Chevalley group of  type over will be denoted by . Theorem 12.1.1 Let be a simple Lie algebra with and let be a field. For each root of and each element of introduce a symbol . Let be the abstract group generated by the elements subject to relations and Let be the centre of . Then is isomorphic to the Chevalley group . The following notations and consequces are followed from 'Classical groups and geometric algebra' by Larry C. Grove. A bilinear form on is a function that becomes a linear fouctional in either variable if the other variable is fixed. Suppose that is a bilinear form on . Say that is symmetric if for all . Suppose that are bilinear forms on spaces , , respectively. An isometry relative to and is an -isomorphism satisfying for all . If is a symmetric form on define via , and call the associated quadratic form. Through this chapter we assume that is a quadratic space of dimension over a filed , with . The isometries of are called orthogonal (linear) transformations; they comprise the orthogonal group . Thus Equivalently if and only if , all If call a rotation, or a proper orthogonal transformation. If call a reversion, or (more commonly) an improper orthogonal transformation. The rotations in form a subgroup which will be denoted , called the special orthogonal group-it is often denoted by or in the leterature. Let be any nonzero anisotropic vector (i.e. ) and define a linear transformation via for all . Then so . We call the (orthogonal) reflection along or through the hyperplane . Often in literature is called a symmetry, e.g. by Arin in [3]. If is a symmetric form on , with quadratic form , then , , is called isotropic if , anisotropic if . For convenience, is taken to be anisotropic, even though . If there exists an isotropic vector then and (and ) are called isotropic; otherwise they are anisotropic. The dimension of a maximal totally isotropic subspace of a quadratic space is called the Witt index of ; it is denoted varioulsy as , or , or , or sometimes in the literature by , etc. Suppose that is an (associative) -algebra with . Say that is compatible with the quadratic on if there is a linear transformation such that for all . Proposition 8.3. Suppose is compatible with via and . Then is unit in if and only if is anisotropic in A Clifford algebra for a quadratic space is an associative algebra (with 1) that is compatible with the quadratic form of , via a map , and such that give any algebra compatible with (i.e. with ) via , then there exists a unique algebra homomorphism so that the diagram is commutative. The decomposition of the Clifford algebra determines a -grading of . Note that and . If the , the sum being taken . Thus is a subalgebra of (the even subalgebra); the elements of are called even homogeneous of degree 0, and the elements of are called odd homogeneous of degree 1. Proposition 8.15. If is a quadratic space there is a unique anti-automorphism with . By definition there is then a unique isomorphism such that , which means that is an anti-automorphism. Proposition 9.1. Suppose that are nonzero anisotropic vectors in such that . Then . Proposition 9.1 is the basis for an important definition. Take . Then is a product of reflections in many ways, say e.g. that and . Then and consequently by Proposition 9.1. It follows that and lie in the same coset of in , and hence determin a well-defined map viz. The map is evidently a homomorphism; it is called the spinor norm on . The kernel of the restriction to of the spinor norm , denoted by is called the reduced orthogonal group of (relative, of course, to the given quadratic form). Theorem 9.7. Suppose that is isotropic. Then Let us sketch an alternative approach to . Define the Clifford group to be the normalizer in the group of units in of the subspace of , i.e. Define the even Clifford group to be . If is nonzero and anisotropic, and , then by Proposition 8.3, so . It follows easily that . If and define . Then so . In fact is a homomorphism from into , called the vector representation of . It can be shown that maps onto , with . If is the unique anti-automorphism of with discussed in Proposition 8.15, then we may define a homomorphism via . The kernel of is called the spin group . Then , the reduced orthogonal group. If , then there exists with , and then gives the spinor norm of . The following consequence follows from 'Basic algebra I' by Nathan Jacobson. Let be a base for and let . Then we have for all conversely if these conditions hold for a linear transformation , then for any we have . Thus a linear transformation of into is orthogonal if and only if Now let the matrix of relative to the base and let . Then the conditions (26) are that for all and . In matrix form these conditions are An orthogonal transformation is called proper or a  rotation if ; otherwise, the transformation is improper. If we choose an orthogonal base for , then the matrix of is diagonal. Then it is clear that any diagonal matrix with diagonal entries or satisfies (27) and hence determines an orthogonal transformation. Moreover, this is  proper or improper according as the number of -1's is even or odd. It is clear that the set of rotations is a normal subgroup of index two in . If is a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form, then is called isotropic or a null form if there exists a vector such that . Such a vector is called isotropic. In the case of a finite field the Witt index is always positive if . The following consequence follows form 'Basic algebra II' by Nathan Jacobson. Definition 4.5. Let be a vector space voer a field , a quadratic form on . Let be the tensor algebra defined by (p. 140) and let be the ideal in generated by all of the elements of the form Then we definet the Clifford algebra of the quadratic form to be the algebra In the remaider of this section, we shall give a brief indiction of some applications of Clifford algebras to the strudy of orthogonal groups. For this purpose, we need to introduce the even (or second) Clifford algebra defined to be the subalgebra of geneated by all of the products , (that is, by ). Definition 4.6. The Clifford group is the subgroup of invertible elements such that for all . Clearly this is a subgroup of the multiplicative group of invertible elements of . The even Clifford group is . If and , then and . Hence the linear transformation of is in the orthogonal group . The map , where is , is a homomorphism of into called the vector representation of the Clifford group. Definition 4.7. The kernel of the homomorphism of into is called the spin group . Its image under the vector representation is called the reduced orthogonal group. If is any rotation and , then is called the spinorial norm of . The spinorial norm map is also a homomorphism (of into ). The spinorial norm of a rotation can be defined directly, without the intervention of the Clifford algebra. If is a given rotation, then we can write . and we can simply define the spinoial norm of f to be the coset . Since and , this is the same element of , which we have called the spinorial norm. Now the reduced orthogonal group can also be defined as the kernel of the spinorial norm map. The reduced orthogonal group contains the commutator subgroup of . Theorem 4.16. Let be of positive Witt index. Then the reduced orthogonal group coincides with the commutator subgroup of and By 'the finite simple groups' of Robert A. Wilson, we have the following the two results: It is easy to find elements of the spin group which square to , and hence the spin group is a proper double cover of the orthogonal group. We write for this group of shape . If is odd, or if and , then is already simple, and the spin group has the structure . If and , then has a centre of order 2, and the spin group has the structure if is odd, and the structure (necessarily with ) is is even. The following follows from 'twisted wreath products and Sylow 2-subgroups of Classical simple groups' by Warren J. Wong. If is an orthogonal group in dimension over , we shall take the quadratic form on the underlying space to be fixed, so that we can define the spinor norm on the whole group , not just on the proper orthogonal group . If is the kernel of the spinor norm, then has index 2 in , and the intersection , which has index in , is the commuttor subgroup of . First we consider the Sylow 2-subgroup of . For , the group is dihedral, so that its Sylow -subgroup is dihedral of order ; , where If , we may take where is a primitive -th root of 1 in If , we may take where is a primitive -th root of in . In either case, has spinor norm , being a symmetry with respect to the hyperplane (line) orthogonal to a vector on which the value of the quadratic form is a square in . Thus the Sylow -subgroup of contained in is , where . This is a dihedral group of order : Put . Then has order , and . where For a general value of , let the direct sum matrix of the above matrix with the identity matrix of degree be again denoted as : Then is an element of order in which is not in . If is a Sylow -subgroup of normalized by , and , then te semi-direct product is a Sylow 2-subgroup of , and we call the natural representation as -system of in . We now conside the Sylow 2-subgroups of and of , where the centre of is a group of order 2 generated by . For , take the Sylow -subgorup of as in (23). The corresponding Sylow 2-subgroup of is the commutator subgroup of , , and is the unique element of order in . In this case, is not a split extension of . However, for , take as in (26) and take where and are identity matrices of degrees and . Then lies in but not in , and and generate a non-cyclic group of order which meets in the identity. If now is a Sylow 2-subgroup of normalized by , then the semi-direct product is a Sylow 2-subgroup of , and we cal the natural representation an -system of in . When , we can take to be the group generated by where and are as before and is the identity matrix of degree 2. We have the relations so that is a central product of two dihedral groups of order , and is the generator of the centre of . The action of and is given by Theorem 10. Let be the great power of dividing , a non-cyclic group of order , the group of order given by (28), the generator of the centre of , and the representation given by (29). Let be an elementary Abelian group of order , and the -system given by If and is the twisted wreath product of copies of , then is equivalent with an -system of in , where , and correpsponds to the generator of the centre of . In particular, the Sylow 2-subgroup of is isomorphic with a twisted wreath product of with copies of , and the Sylow 2-subgroup of is isomorphic with where is genertated by . The following follows from 'the geometry of the classical groups' by Donald E. Taylor. If is singular and , we put and note that is a well-defined element of for fields of all characteristics. Moreover, if is singular, we obtain the transformation of case II whereas if is non-singular, we obtain those of case III of the previous section. Following Tamagawa (1958) and Higman (1978) we call a siegel transformation. 11.46 Theorem. If , then Witt index of is at least , and , then is generated by the Siegel transformations of The following follows from 'the subgroup structure of finie classical groups' by Peter B. Kleidman and Martin W. Liebeck for . for . The following follows from 'atlas of finite groups' by John Horton Conway, R. T. CURTIS, S. P. NORTON, R. A. PARKER, R. A. WILSON and with computational assistance from J. G. THACKRAY. For a -module with irreducible character we have the Frobenius-Schur indicator and takes one of the values {+1, -1, 0}, as is afforded by a real representation or is real-valued but not afforded by a real representation or is not real-valued, respectively. The following conseqences are followed by number theory and representation theory of finite groups. It is well known, and easy to derive from the orthogonality relations for group characters and properties of the Frobenius-Schur indicator that is a square in if and only if When is an even integer and a power of a odd prime, then .

So, we avoid almost half of the calculations.) I have a proof (I give it below), but it is perhaps too complicated. Thus, my questions are : 1° is the statement correct ? 2° if the statement is correct, is the proof accurate ? 3° if the proof is accurate, is it the simplest possible ? 4° if the statement is correct, is it useful ? 5° do you know a reference to the literature about this question ? Definition. Let $G$ be a group. We define a semistable sequence of elements of $G$ as a nonempty finite sequence $(a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n})$ of pairwise distinct elements of $G$ such that for every $i, j$ in $\{1, \ldots , n\}$ such that $i \leq j$ , $a_{i} a_{j}$ is in $\{a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n}\}$ . Our problem is to prove that if $(a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n})$ is a semistable sequence of elements of $G$ , then $\{a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n}\}$ is a subgroup of $G$ . Step 1. Let $(a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n})$ be a semistable sequence of elements of a group $G$ , let $i$ be an index in $\{1, \ldots , n\}$ . Then $a_{i}$ is of finite order ( $\leq n$ ) and for every $s$ in $\mathbb{Z}$ , $a_{i}^{s}$ is in $\{a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n}\}$ . The function $a \mapsto a^{-1}$ is a permutation of $\{a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n}\}$ . Proof. Let us prove that for every natural number $r \geq 1$ , $a_{i}^{r}$ is in $\{a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n}\}$ . It is true if $r = 1$ . Assume that it is true for a natural number $r$ . Then $a_{i}^{r} = a_{j}$ for some $j$ . It implies $a_{i}^{r+1} = a_{i}a_{j}$ and also $a_{i}^{r+1} = a_{j}a_{i}$ . The first of these two results gives $a_{i}^{r+1} \in \{a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n}\}$ if $i \leq j$ and the second result also gives $a_{i}^{r+1} \in \{a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n}\}$ if $j \leq i$ . By induction on $r$ , we conclude that (1) for every natural number $r \geq 1$ , $a_{i}^{r}$ is in $\{a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n}\}$ . In particular, the $n+1$ elements $a_{i}, a_{i}^{2}, \ldots , a_{i}^{n+1}$ are all in $\{a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n}\}$ . Since $\{a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n}\}$ has only $n$ elements, there are at least two exponents $r$ and $t$ in $\{1, \ldots , n+1\}$ such that $a_{i}^{t} = a_{i}^{r}$ and this implies that $a_{i}$ is of finite order ( $\leq n$ ). Thus, for every $s$ in $\mathbb{Z}$ , $a_{i}^{s}$ is of the form $a_{i}^{r}$ with some $r \geq 1$ ,thus, in view of (1), $a_{i}^{s}$ is in $\{a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n}\}$ for every $s$ in $\mathbb{Z}$ . It is true in particular for $s=-1$ , thus the inverse of each element of $\{a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n}\}$ is in $\{a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n}\}$ , so the  function $a \mapsto a^{-1}$ is a permutation of $\{a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n}\}$ . Step 2. Let $(a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n})$ be a semistable sequence of elements of a group $G$ , let $i$ be an index in $\{1, \ldots , n\}$ . The two following conditions are equivalent : (i) for every $j \in \{1, \ldots , n\}$ , $a_{i} a_{j}$ is in $\{a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n}\}$ ; (ii) for every $j \in \{1, \ldots , n\}$ , $a_{j} a_{i}$ is in $\{a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n}\}$ . Proof. Let's define (temporarily) a left universal of $(a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n})$ as an $a_{i}$ such that condition (i) is satisfied, i.e. such that for every $j \in \{1, \ldots , n\}$ , $a_{i} a_{j}$ is in $\{a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n}\}$ and let's define a right universal of $(a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n})$ as an $a_{i}$ such that condition (ii) is staisfied, i.e. such that for every $j \in \{1, \ldots , n\}$ , $a_{j} a_{i}$ is in $\{a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n}\}$ . Thus, the statement amounts to say that the left universals are exactly the right universals. Let us prove that if $a_{i}$ is a left universal, then $a_{i}^{-1}$ is a right universal. Since $a_{i}$ is a left universal, we have $a_{i}a_{j} \in \{a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n}\}$ for every $j$ . We saw at step 1 that the function $a \mapsto a^{-1}$ is a permutation of $\{a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n}\}$ , thus $a_{j}^{-1} a_{i}^{-1} \in \{a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n}\}$ for every $j$ . Still because $a \mapsto a^{-1}$ is a permutation of $\{a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n}\}$ , $a_{j}^{-1}$ runs over $\{a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n}\}$ as does $a_{j}$ , thus, for every $j \in \{1, \ldots , n\}$ , $a_{j} a_{i}^{-1} \in \{a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n}\}$ . Since (step 1) $a_{i}^{-1}$ is in $\{a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n}\}$ , this proves that (1) if $a_{i}$ is a left universal, $a_{i}^{-1}$ is a right universal. Similarly, (2) if $a_{i}$ is a right universal, $a_{i}^{-1}$ is a left universal. Now let us prove that the inverse of a left universal is also a left universal. Let $a_{i}$ be a left universal, let $j$ an index in $\{1, \ldots , n\}$ . If $r$ is a natural number such that $a_{i}^{r} a_{j}$ is in $\{a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n}\}$ , we have $a_{i}^{r} a_{j} = a_{k}$ for some $k$ , whence $a_{i}^{r+1} a_{j} = a_{i}a_{k}$ . Since $a_{i}$ is a left universal, the right member is in $\{a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n}\}$ , thus $a_{i}^{r+1} a_{j}$ is in $\{a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n}\}$ . By induction on $r$ , we conclude that for every natural number $r \geq 1$ , $a_{i}^{r}$ is a left universal. Since (step 1) $a_{i}$ is of finite order, $a_{i}^{-1}$ is of the form $a_{i}^{r}$ with a natural number $r \geq 1$ , thus $a_{i}^{-1}$ is a left universal. We thus proved that (3) if $a_{i}$ is a left universal, $a_{i}^{-1}$ is also a left universal. Similarly, (4) if $a_{i}$ is a right universal, $a_{i}^{-1}$ is also a right universal. Let $a_{i}$ be a left universal. In view of (3), $a_{i}^{-1}$ is also a left universal. Thus, in view of (1), $a_{i}$ is a right universal. Thus every left universal is a right universal. Similarly, every right universal is a left universal. As noted, this proves step 2. Definition. Let $(a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n})$ be a semistable sequence of elements of a group $G$ . We define a universal of $(a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n})$ as an $a_{i}$ such that the two equivalent conditions of step 2 are satisfied. Theorem. Let $(a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n})$ be a semistable sequence of elements of a group $G$ . The set $\{a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n}\}$ is a subgroup of $G$ . Proof. Since $(a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n})$ is a semistable sequence of elements of a group $G$ , we have $a_{1} a_{j} \in \{a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n}\}$ for every $j$ in $\{1, \ldots , n\}$ , thus $a_{1}$ satisfies condition (i) of step 2 on $a_{i}$ , thus (1) $a_{1}$ is a universal of $(a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n})$ . If $n \geq 2$ , we have $a_{2} a_{j} \in \{a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n}\}$ for every $j \geq 2$ , because $(a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n})$ is a semistable sequence, and we have also $a_{2} a_{1} \in \{a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n}\}$ , because of (1). Thus, if $n \geq 2$ , (2) $a_{2}$ is a universal of $(a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n})$ . Similarly, we deduce from (1) and (2) that (if $n \geq 3$ ) $a_{3}$ is a universal, and so on. Thus $a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n}$ are all universals, thus $\{a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n}\}$ is a subgroup of $G$ . Edit. The proof of relation (3) in step 2 (if $a_{i}$ is a left universal, $a_{i}^{-1}$ is also a left universal) can be simplified. Since $a_{i}$ is a left universal, we have $a_{i} A = A$ , where $A$ denotes the set $\{a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n}\}$ . Left multiplication by $a_{i}^{-1}$ gives $A = a_{i}^{-1} A$ . Since, from step 1, $ a_{i}^{-1}$ is in A, this shows that $a_{i}^{-1}$ is a left universal. Similarly, the inverse of a right universal is a right universal.

See for example here . My thinking: The group $P_n$ is generated by the following permutations $g_i,i=1,2,\ldots,n$ , $$ \begin{aligned} g_1&=(12),\\ g_2&=(13)(24),\\ g_3&=(15)(26)(37)(48),\\ \vdots&\\ g_n&=\prod_{j=1}^{2^{n-1}}(j;j+2^{n-1}), \end{aligned} $$ where $g_j$ is a product of $2^{j-1}$ disjoint $2$ -cycles pointwise intechanging the ranges $[1,2^{j-1}]$ and $[2^{j-1}+1,2^j]$ .

90,Can we decide if a dragon comes home?,Can we decide if a dragon comes home?,,"First, a quick definition: A (deterministic) Lindenmayer system (L-system) over an alphabet $\mathcal{A}$ is essentially specified by a function $f:\mathcal{A}\mapsto\mathcal{A}^*$ (where $\mathcal{A}^*$ is the set of strings over $\mathcal{A}$; that is, finite sequences of elements of $\mathcal{A}$). This extends to a function $f^*: \mathcal{A}^*\mapsto\mathcal{A}^*$ by concatenation: $f^*(a_1a_2\cdots a_n)=f(a_1)f(a_2)\cdots f(a_n)$. The L-system 'operates' by iterating $f^*$ starting from an initial word $w_0\in\mathcal{A}^*$, producing the sequence of words $w_1=f^*(w_0)$, $w_2=f^*(w_1)$, etc.  For instance, the Fibonacci word can be obtained by taking $\mathcal{A}=\{a,b\}$, defining $f$ via $f(a)=ab$, $f(b)=a$, and taking the initial word $w_0$ to be $a$; then the sequence is $w_1=ab$, $w_2=aba$, $w_3=abaab$, $w_4=abaababa$, etc; it can be shown tha $w_n$ is of length $F_{n+1}$ with $F_n$ $a$s in it and $F_{n-1}$ $b$s. The Wikipedia link there shows how to get several 'classic' iterated curves such as the dragon curve, Koch snowflake, etc. by generating words in an L-system and then mapping them to 'turtle-like' motions in the plane by interpreting each letter in the word as a command (i.e., a transformation in the plane): move forwards, turn $90^\circ$ left or right, etc. This interpretation prompts my question: suppose we're given a deterministic L-system over some (finite) alphabet $\mathcal{A}$, an initial word $w\in \mathcal{A}^*$, and a function $M: \mathcal{A}\mapsto G$ from the alphabet to elements of some automatic group $G$ (for instance, the 'square grid' group generated by translations of the plane by one unit in the $x$ direction and rotations by $90^\circ$).  Then can it be decided whether some iterate of $w$ maps via $M^*$ (here of course $M^*$ is the extension of $M$ to a function from $\mathcal{A}^*$ to $G$ via $M^*(a_1a_2\ldots a_n)=M(a_1)\circ M(a_2)\cdots\circ M(a_n)$ where $\circ$ is the group operator in $G$) to the identity in $G$?  If so, what's known about the algorithmic complexity of the problem? It's clear that the problem is semi-decidable: since $G$ is automatic it has solvable word problem (in fact, a given word in the generators can be tested for identity in time at worst quadratic in its size), and so we can simply to apply the L-system over and over to generate the sequence of words $w_0=w, w_1=L(w_0), w_2=L(w_1), \ldots$, testing each of the elements $M^*(w_0), M^*(w_1), \ldots$ of $G$ to see if it's the identity.  Solvability seems to be essentially equivalent to asking if there is some algorithmic bound $b=b(|w|)$ (presumably also depending on the size of the L-system and the group presentation) such that if none of the iterates through $w_b$ is the identity, then none after will be; for instance, there may be some sort of integer 'charge' definable on words such that an iteration of the L-system increases the charge and the charge of the identity is zero. Solving this problem would also solve a simple generalization where instead of checking for the identity, we check for membership in some finite subgroup $H$ of $G$ (for instance, in the 'square grid' example above, we could check whether the element is in the $C_4$ subgroup of only rotations): simply add a new symbol to the L-system, mapping to itself under iterates of the system; prepend it to the initial word, and then for each element $h\in H$, generate a function $M_h$ that extends $M$ by taking the new symbol to $h$; then for each $h$ just run the decision algorithm with the slightly larger L-system and the mapping $M_h$.  It may also be possible to test for membership in a finite-index (normal?) subgroup of $G$ through similar means, but I haven't quite worked out all the details there; that may actually be a 'proper' generalization of the problem.","First, a quick definition: A (deterministic) Lindenmayer system (L-system) over an alphabet $\mathcal{A}$ is essentially specified by a function $f:\mathcal{A}\mapsto\mathcal{A}^*$ (where $\mathcal{A}^*$ is the set of strings over $\mathcal{A}$; that is, finite sequences of elements of $\mathcal{A}$).

As a first guess I would say that the following rep is irreducible. $$\text{Let }~~~\mathcal{D}\colon SO(2)\rightarrow GL(2,\mathbb{R}), ~~ \mathcal{D}(R):=R.$$ This representation acts on the vector space $\mathbb{R}^2$ , and, as one can imagine, there are no vectors which lie in the plane and that are invariant under all rotations in the plane (except for the trivial zero vector) thus there is no non-trivial invariant subspace and this representation is irreducible. But then since $SO(2)$ is an Abelian group, by Schur's lemma its irreps are one-dimensional, which is in clear contradiction to the above. I suspect this is because Schur's lemma applies only to complex vector spaces. So it is correct to say that with regards to real representations $\mathcal{D}$ is irreducible, but not with regards to complex representations. So is the question as stated in the title ill-defined, and the word real or complex representations must be inserted?

EDIT Let $$\Psi\colon U(1)\rightarrow SO(2);\quad \Psi(e^{i\phi})=\begin{pmatrix}\cos(\phi)&\sin(\phi)\\-\sin(\phi)&\cos(\phi)\end{pmatrix}$$ be the map that establishes the isomorphism $U(1)\cong SO(2)$ . Denote the (complex) irreps of $U(1)$ by $\mathcal{T}^{(n)}$ where $$\mathcal{T}^{(n)}:U(1)\rightarrow GL(1,\mathbb{C})\cong\mathbb{C}^*;~~~\mathcal{T}^{(n)}(e^{i\phi})=e^{in\phi},~~n\in\mathbb{Z}.$$ Denote the (real) irreps of $SO(2)$ by $\mathcal{D}^{(n)}$ where $\mathcal{D}^{(n)}\colon SO(2)\rightarrow GL(2,\mathbb{R})$ and $$\mathcal{D}^{(n)}\bigg(\begin{pmatrix}\cos(\phi)&&\sin(\phi)\\-\sin(\phi)&&\cos(\phi)\end{pmatrix}\bigg)=\begin{pmatrix}\cos(n\phi)&&\sin(n\phi)\\-\sin(n\phi)&&\cos(n\phi)\end{pmatrix}.$$ Now $\mathcal{T}^{(n)}$ acts on the vector space $\mathbb{C}$ whilst $\mathcal{D}^{(n)}$ acts on the vector space $\mathbb{R}^2$ and since $\mathbb{C}\cong\mathbb{R}^2$ we can use $\Psi$ to show that the irreps are the same: $$\mathcal{D}^{(n)}\cong \Psi \circ\mathcal{T}^{(n)}.$$ Does this show that the complex and real irreps of $SO(2)$ are the same, or have I shown something else? Does this result generalize?","As per the title I wish to describe all of the irreducible representations of the group . As a first guess I would say that the following rep is irreducible. This representation acts on the vector space , and, as one can imagine, there are no vectors which lie in the plane and that are invariant under all rotations in the plane (except for the trivial zero vector) thus there is no non-trivial invariant subspace and this representation is irreducible. But then since is an Abelian group, by Schur's lemma its irreps are one-dimensional, which is in clear contradiction to the above. I suspect this is because Schur's lemma applies only to complex vector spaces. So it is correct to say that with regards to real representations is irreducible, but not with regards to complex representations. So is the question as stated in the title ill-defined, and the word real or complex representations must be inserted? This question appeared in an exam, when phrased in this way does one usually assume real representations is meant? If so then would I be correct in using or the isomorphism and thus irreps are labelled by an integer? EDIT Let be the map that establishes the isomorphism . Denote the (complex) irreps of by where Denote the (real) irreps of by where and Now acts on the vector space whilst acts on the vector space and since we can use to show that the irreps are the same: Does this show that the complex and real irreps of are the same, or have I shown something else?
