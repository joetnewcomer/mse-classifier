40,Essentially continuous a.e. characteristic function,Essentially continuous a.e. characteristic function,,"I'm reading a few papers and trying to understand why one paper is supposed to be a strengthening of the other. The bulk of the papers didn't have to do with what follows, but at one point they imply that an a.e. essentially continuous characteristic function is automatically a characteristic function of a set which is a.e. an open set, and this is stronger. I'll make the definitions rigorous: We say $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is a point of $\textit{essential continuity}$ for $f$ (a function on $\mathbb{R}^n$) if for every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists a neighborhood $U_{x,\varepsilon}$ of $x$ such that $|f(y)-f(x)| < \varepsilon$ for a.e. $y \in U_{x,\varepsilon}$ (hence the ""essentially"" continuous). I have two main questions (and one side question which is less important): Suppose the characteristic function $1_E$ is a.e. essentially continuous, that is, for a.e. $x$, $x$ is a point of essential continuity for $1_E$. Then why must $E$ be a.e. equivalent to an open set? For this question, I was thinking of letting $\varepsilon < 1$ be fixed, and then the definition of essential continuity implies that for a.e. $x$, there is a neighborhood $U_x$ of $x$ such that for a.e. $y \in U$, we have $|1_E(x)-1_E(x)| < 1$. In particular, this means either both $x$ and $y$ are in $E$, or both are not in $E$. I tried to let my open set $U$ be the union of all the $U_x$ for $x \in E$ which are points of essential continuity, but the problem is there may be points $y$ in each $U_x$ which are not in $E$, and there could be uncountably many $U_x$. Thus the resulting $U$ is not in fact open. Is there a good example of a set $E$ which is a.e. equivalent to an open set, but $1_E$ is not a.e. essentially continuous? I don't really know where to start with this one, but I imagine we require a highly disjoint set, like some sort of fat cantor set. This particular set won't work though, since the fat Cantor set, say $K$, is not equivalent to an open set, but perhaps the complement $[0,1] \setminus K$ will work - I'm stuck on this too though. I'm curious if we can strengthen 1 and 2: with the hypothesis of 1, why must both $E$ and $E^c$ be a.e. equivalent to open sets? And for 2, does there exist a set $E$ a.e. equivalent to an open set such that $E^c$ is also a.e. equivalent to an open set, and $1_E$ is not a.e. essentially continuous? The motivation for 3 is that I believe the first paper's result can be strengthened from a statement about $E$ being a.e. equivalent to an open set, to a statement about both $E$ and $E^c$ being equivalent to an open set. If so, then in order for the second paper to be a true generalization, point 3 must hold.

I need to prove the following proposition Proposition $\quad$ Lebesgue outer measure on $\mathbb{R}^d$ is an outer measure, and it assigns to each $d$ -dimensional interval its volume. where Definition $\quad$ Let $X$ be a set, and let $\mathcal{P}(X)$ be the collection of all subsets of $X$ . An outer measure on $X$ is a function $\mu^*:\mathcal{P}(X)\to[0,+\infty]$ such that $\mu^*(\emptyset) = 0$ , if $A \subseteq B \subseteq X$ , then $\mu^*(A)\leq\mu^*(B)$ , and if $\{A_n\}$ is an infinite sequence of subsets of $X$ , then $\mu^*(\bigcup_nA_n)\leq\sum_n\mu^*(A_n)$ . and Definition $\quad$ We define Lebesgue outer measure on $\mathbb{R}^d$ as follows. A $d$ -dimensional interval is a subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$ of the form $I_1 \times \dots \times I_d$ , where $I_1, \dots, I_d$ are subintervals of $\mathbb{R}$ and $I_1 \times \dots \times I_d$ is given by \begin{align*}     I_1 \times \dots \times I_d = \{(x_1,\dots,x_d):x_i \in I_i\ \text{for } i=1,\dots,d\}. \end{align*} Note that the intervals $I_1, \dots, I_d$ , and hence the $d$ -dimensional interval $I_1 \times \dots \times I_d$ , can be open, closed, or neither open nor closed. The volume of the $d$ -dimensional interval $I_1 \times \dots \times I_d$ is the product of the lengths of the intervals $I_1, \dots, I_d$ , and will be denoted by $\text{vol}(I_1 \times \dots \times I_d)$ . For each subset $A$ of $\mathbb{R}^d$ let $\mathcal{C}(A)$ be the set of all sequences $\{R_i\}$ of bounded and open $d$ -dimensional intervals for which $A \subseteq \bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}R_i$ . Then $\lambda^*(A)$ , the Lebesgue outer measure of $A$ is the infimum of the set \begin{align*}     \left\{\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\text{vol}(R_i):\{R_i\}\in\mathcal{C}(A)\right\}. \end{align*} Here is my attempt: Proof $\quad$ We begin by verifying that $\lambda^*$ is an outer measure. The relation $\lambda^*(\emptyset)=0$ holds, since for each positive number $\epsilon$ there is a sequence $\{R_i\}$ of bounded and open $d$ -dimensional intervals (whose union necessarily includes $\emptyset$ ) such that $\sum_i\text{vol}(R_i)<\epsilon$ ; for example, let $R_i = (a_1^i,b_1^i)\times\dots\times(a_d^i,b_d^i)$ where $b_1^i-a_1^i = \dots = b_d^i-a_d^i = \left(\frac{\epsilon}{3 \cdot 2^{i-1}}\right)^{\frac{1}{d}}$ , so that $\text{vol}(R_i) = \frac{\epsilon}{3 \cdot 2^{i-1}}$ , which implies that $\sum_i\text{vol}(R_i) = \frac{2\epsilon}{3} < \epsilon$ . For the monotonicity of $\lambda^*$ , note that if $A \subseteq B$ , then each sequence of bounded open $d$ -dimensional intervals that covers $B$ also covers $A$ , and so $\lambda^*(A) \leq \lambda^*(B)$ . Now consider that countable subadditivity of $\lambda^*$ . Let $\{A_b\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be an arbitrary sequence of subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$ . If $\sum_n\lambda^*(A_n) = +\infty$ , then $\lambda^*(\bigcup_nA_n) \leq \sum_n\lambda^*(A_n)$ certainly holds. So suppose that $\sum_n\lambda^*(A_n) < +\infty$ , and let $\epsilon$ be an arbitrary positive number. For each $n$ choose a sequence $\{R_{n,i}\}_{i=1}^{\infty}$ of bounded open $d$ -dimensional intervals that covers $A_n$ and satisfies \begin{align*} \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\text{vol}(R_{n,i}) < \lambda^*(A_n) + \frac{\epsilon}{2^n}. \end{align*} If we combine these sequences into one sequence $\{R_j\}$ , then the combined sequence satisfies \begin{align*} \bigcup_nA_n \subseteq \bigcup_jR_j \end{align*} and \begin{align*} \sum_j\text{vol}(R_j) < \sum_n\left(\lambda^*(A_n)+\frac{\epsilon}{2^n}\right) = \sum_n\lambda^*(A_n) + \epsilon. \end{align*} These relations, together with the fact that $\epsilon$ is arbitrary, imply that $\lambda^*(\bigcup_nA_n) \leq \sum_n\lambda^*(A_n)$ . Thus, $\lambda^*$ is an outer measure. Now we compute the outer measure of the $d$ -dimensional intervals of $\mathbb{R}^d$ . First consider a closed bounded, and thus compact, $d$ -dimensional interval $K$ .

I need to prove the following proposition Proposition Lebesgue outer measure on is an outer measure, and it assigns to each -dimensional interval its volume. where Definition Let be a set, and let be the collection of all subsets of . An outer measure on is a function such that , if , then , and if is an infinite sequence of subsets of , then . and Definition We define Lebesgue outer measure on as follows. A -dimensional interval is a subset of of the form , where are subintervals of and is given by Note that the intervals , and hence the -dimensional interval , can be open, closed, or neither open nor closed. The volume of the -dimensional interval is the product of the lengths of the intervals , and will be denoted by . For each subset of let be the set of all sequences of bounded and open -dimensional intervals for which . Then , the Lebesgue outer measure of is the infimum of the set Here is my attempt: Proof We begin by verifying that is an outer measure. The relation holds, since for each positive number there is a sequence of bounded and open -dimensional intervals (whose union necessarily includes ) such that ; for example, let where , so that , which implies that . For the monotonicity of , note that if , then each sequence of bounded open -dimensional intervals that covers also covers , and so . Now consider that countable subadditivity of . Let be an arbitrary sequence of subsets of . If , then certainly holds. So suppose that , and let be an arbitrary positive number. For each choose a sequence of bounded open -dimensional intervals that covers and satisfies If we combine these sequences into one sequence , then the combined sequence satisfies and These relations, together with the fact that is arbitrary, imply that . Thus, is an outer measure. Now we compute the outer measure of the -dimensional intervals of . First consider a closed bounded, and thus compact, -dimensional interval . We cover with a sequence of bounded open -dimensional intervals in which the first -dimensional interval is barely larger than , and the sum of the volumes of the other -dimensional intervals is very small; for example, let be an arbitrary positive number and let where and for . Then, for all , and so . We turn to the reverse inequality. Note that if is a compact -dimensional interval and if is a sequence of bounded and open -dimensional for which , then there is a positive integer such that , and can be decomposed into a finite collection that overlap only on their boundaries and are such that for each the interior of is included in some (where ). From this it follows that and hence that . Therefore, . The outer measure of an arbitrary bounded -dimensional interval is its volume, since such a -dimensional interval includes and is included in closed bounded intervals of volume arbitrarily close to the volume of itself. Finally, an unbounded -dimensional interval has infinite outer measure, since it includes arbitrarily larger closed bounded -dimensional intervals.

Then, there exists a unique $\Sigma$ -finite measure $\pi$ on $\big( E \times F, \mathcal{E} \otimes \mathcal{F} \big)$ such that, for every positive $f$ in $\mathcal{E} \otimes \mathcal{F}$ , \begin{equation} \pi f= \int_E \mu(dx) \int_F \nu(dy) f(x,y) = \int_F \nu(dy) \int_E \mu(dx) f(x,y) \end{equation} Issue with proof The proof starts by considering the first double integral, and observes that, under the assumption that both $\mu$ and $\nu$ are $\Sigma$ -finite, it can be expressed as \begin{equation} \pi f= \int_E \mu(dx) \int_F \nu(dy) f(x,y) = \\ = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}\int_E \mu_i(dx) \int_F \nu_j(dy) f(x,y) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} (\mu_i \times \nu_j) f \tag{1} \end{equation} Then, it defines the function \begin{align*} \hat{f} \colon F \times E & \longrightarrow \mathbb{R_+}\\ (y,x) &\longmapsto f(x,y) \end{align*} and considers the second iterated integral: \begin{equation} \hat{\pi} \hat{f}= \int_F \nu(dy) \int_E \mu(dx) \hat{f}(y,x) = \sum_{j=1}^{\infty}  \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \int_F \nu_j(dy) \int_E \mu_i(dx) \hat{f}(y,x) = \sum_{j=1}^{\infty}  \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} (\nu_j \times \mu_i) \hat{f} \end{equation} where $\hat{\pi}(B \times A) = \nu(B) \mu(A)$ . The goal is obviously to show that $ \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} (\mu_i \times \nu_j) f = \pi f = \hat{\pi} \hat{f} = \sum_{j=1}^{\infty}  \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} (\nu_j \times \mu_i) \hat{f}$ Since all the integrals inside the summations are non-negative numbers, the order of summation can be exchanged. The goal is then to show that the order of integration can be exchanged. The proof now rightly states that it suffices to show that the integrals can be exchanged for some arbitrarily fixed $i$ and $j$ , i.e. \begin{equation} \int_E \mu_i(dx) \int_F \nu_j(dy) f(x,y) = \int_F \nu_j(dy) \int_E \mu_i(dx) f(x,y) \end{equation} The advantage is that now $\mu_i$ and $\nu_j$ are finite, i.e., the proof for $\Sigma$ -finite measures boils down to proving the exchangeability of integrals for finite measures. Hence, in the following we will get rid of the indexes $i$ and $j$ and pretend that we are working under the assumption that $\mu$ and $\nu$ are finite. The textbook now considers a measurable rectangle $A \times B$ , and defines the function \begin{align*} h \colon E \times F & \longrightarrow F \times E\\ (x,y) &\longmapsto (y,x) \end{align*} Also, it observes that $f = \hat{f} \circ h$ . Here is the core of the proof, that is conducted under the assumption of finiteness of $\mu$ and $\nu$ , which is not needed in my view. The book observes that \begin{equation} \pi \circ h^{-1}(B \times A)=\pi(h^{-1}(B \times A)) = \pi(A \times B) = \\ = \mu(A) \nu(B) = \nu(B) \mu(A) = \hat{\pi} (B \times A) \tag{2} \end{equation} Hence, upon noticing that \begin{equation} f(x,y)=(\hat{f} \circ h)(x,y)=\hat{f}(h(x,y))=\hat{f}(y,x)=f(x,y) \end{equation} it holds \begin{equation} \hat{\pi} \hat{f} = \pi (\hat{f} \circ h) = \pi f \end{equation} which proves the statement. My problem is: I believe that equation 2 can be applied also to non- $\Sigma$ -finite measures. In this case, I would just do that on the measure $\pi$ in equation 1 and get the exchangeability of the integrals for any product measure, without the need for the $\Sigma$ -finiteness assumption. The way I would proceed I wondered if the actual measure of the rectangle $A \times B$ requires assumption on $\mu$ and $\nu$ in order to allow the exchangeability. In other words, I wondered if the assumption of $\Sigma$ -finiteness of both is required for \begin{equation} \pi(A \times B) = \int_A \mu(dx) \int_B \nu(dy) = \mu(A) \nu(B) = \nu(B) \mu(A) = \int_B \nu(dy) \int_A \mu(dx) = \hat{\pi}(B \times A) \end{equation} and I would say that $\mu(A) \nu(B) = \nu(B) \mu(A)$ holds irrespective of any $\Sigma$ -finiteness assumption.","I have been studying Fubini theorem and its proof on ""Probability and Stochastics"" by Erhan Cinlar.
