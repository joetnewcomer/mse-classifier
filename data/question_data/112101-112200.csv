0,Proof of Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups?,Proof of Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups?,,"The only proofs I've seen of this tend to involve a few intermediate results and a couple of induction proofs with some clever constructions in them. They aren't hard to follow and they're pretty short, but they do still seem to remove some of the ""why it should be true"" aspect of it. The result seems blindingly obvious to me from a generator perspective: If a finite abelian group $G$ has generators $x,y,z...$ then any element can be represented by the form $$g=x^ay^bz^c...$$ And there's an immediate and clear isomorphism from this to $$\mathbb{Z}_{|x|}\times\mathbb{Z}_{|y|}\times\mathbb{Z}_{|z|}\times\cdots$$ Done. It can't help but be true. As far as I can see this is immediately extensible to finitely generated abelian groups as well. But the proofs I've seen, while short and simple enough, have never made its proof seem quite so clear. Is there some major complication I'm missing here? I don't see anything fishy in assuming the existence of the generators, or proving the form of $g$, or actually constructing the isomorphism. But I assume I'm missing something because I've never seen the result proved like this, even though it's an obvious construction. Is the longer proof for pedagogical reasons (i.e. the lemmas and techniques are useful later), or am I missing a big hole in this proof?","The only proofs I've seen of this tend to involve a few intermediate results and a couple of induction proofs with some clever constructions in them.

24,Rigorous proof of the Jordan-Hölder Theorem,Rigorous proof of the Jordan-Hölder Theorem,,"As far as I am aware, the standard books on abstract algebra (Lang, Dummit, Rotman, Grillet, etc.) do not give a rigorous proof of the Jordan-Hölder Theorem. Here are two examples from Lang and Grillet: As you can see, there's a lot of prose in these proofs. I do not have any issues with these ""prose-laden"" proofs per se; however, I do like to replace them with their formal counterparts whenever possible. To some of you this may seem rather trivial, but to me it isn't: I genuinely do not understand these sorts of proofs of the Jordan-Hölder Theorem. Let me explain why. Let $G$ be a group (finite or otherwise) with identity $e$ . To say that two normal series $(H_i)_{0\leq i\leq n}$ , $(K_j)_{0\leq j\leq m}$ of $G$ are equivalent means that $n=m$ , and $(\forall i)(i\in[0,n-1]\Rightarrow \frac{H_i}{H_{i+1}}\,\simeq\,\frac{K_{\phi(i)}}{K_{\phi(i)+1}})$ , where $\phi:[0,n-1]\rightarrow[0,n-1]$ is a permutation of the interval $[0,n-1]$ . Now go back to the proofs of Lang and Grillet: Is it at all obvious how these proofs satisfy (1) and (2)? (They don't even bother to construct a candidate for $\phi$ .) Logically speaking, I should be able to give a formal proof of (1) and (2) being satisfied for two composition series, no? Ok—Let $(H_i)_{0\leq i\leq n}$ , $(K_j)_{0\leq j\leq m}$ be two composition series of $G$ . By Schreier, we know that these two series have equivalent refinements: $(H'_i)_{0\leq i\leq n'}$ , $(K'_j)_{0\leq j\leq n'}$ . This means that we have a permutation $$\psi:[0,n'-1]\rightarrow [0,n'-1]$$ such that $$(\forall i)(i\in[0,n'-1]\Rightarrow \frac{H'_i}{H'_{i+1}}\,\simeq\,\frac{K'_{\psi(i)}}{K'_{\psi(i)+1}}).$$ Now I have to show that (1) and (2) hold for our original series. That partly means I should have to prove (either by construction or by contradiction) that their exists a permutation of the interval $[0,n-1]$ for which (2) holds: this means that I should be able to assume $i\in[0,n-1]$ and show that the consequent must also hold. Let us fix some notation: \begin{align*} \mathcal{A}&=\{X\ |\ (\exists i)(i\in[0,n'-1]\ \land\ X=H'_i/H'_{i+1})\}\\ \mathcal{B}&=\{X\in\mathcal{A}\ |\ K\simeq\{e\}\}\\ \mathcal{C}&=\{X\ |\ (\exists i)(i\in[0,n-1]\ \land\ X=H_i/H_{i+1})\} \end{align*} Then $\mathcal{A}-\mathcal{B}=\mathcal{C}$ . Let $\mathcal{A'},\mathcal{B'},\mathcal{C'}$ denote the same sets except with $K'_{\psi(i)}/K'_{\psi(i)+1}$ , $K_i/K_{i+1}$ and $m$ replacing $H'_i/H'_{i+1}$ , $H_i/H_{i+1}$ and $n$ . Then also $\mathcal{A'}-\mathcal{B'}=\mathcal{C'}$ . You can say that this shows that the non-trivial factors of each refinement are the factors of its original series. This is roughly what Grillet says mid-paragraph. But why should $m=n$ ? I should be able to derive a contradiction by supposing $n\ne m$ , no? Moreover, how does this prove the existence of a permutation $\phi$ satisfying the formula $$(*)\ \ \ (\forall i)(i\in[0,n-1]\Rightarrow \frac{H_i}{H_{i+1}}\,\simeq\,\frac{K_{\phi(i)}}{K_{\phi(i)+1}})?$$ The part of the proof involving the permutation is essentially ignored by both Lang and Grillet. Is it because it is unimportant? Then why include it in the definition of equivalence ? In any case, I would appreciate any help I can get w.r.t the proof of the implication $(*)$ . EDIT: Two votes have been cast to close this question; I am not sure why. I will restate my request in order to once again establish that I have asked this question in good faith. What I am looking for is very simple: (a) a proof that deduces $H_i/H_{i+1}\simeq K_{\phi(i)}/K_{\phi(i)+1}$ from the premise $i\in[0,n'-1]$ (essentially a demonstration of a logical implication). I would appreciate it if you could try to only invoke Schreier as an existential result (i.e. not putting further assumptions on the form of the equivalent refinements); (b) a proof that shows (and not merely says) why $m=n$ . This has to be a formal set theoretic proof of equinumerosity. Please do not give me a prose proof. I already have Lang et al. for that. Also, I have eyes and I can read. Therefore, please, do not give me chewed up versions of Lang's proof. I think this is a reasonable demand. If you think that I have violated the rules, please leave a comment explaining why. Thank you. EDIT 2: Consider the following lists: \begin{align*} &0,1,\ldots,n-1 &(a)\\ &H_0/H_1,\ldots, H_{n-1}/H_n &(b)\\ &H'_0/H'_1,\ldots, H'_{n'-1}/H'_{n'} &(c)\\ &K'_{0}/K'_{1},\ldots, K'_{n'-1}/K'_{n'} &(d)\\ &K_0/K_1,\ldots, K_{m-1}/K_m &(e)\\ &0,1,\ldots,m-1 &(f) \end{align*} Using the notation employed above, I will try to explain my difficulty with the proof 3.0 (maybe the next patch giving us version 4.0 will be the lucky one?), submitted below, in its author's favourite medium for doing mathematics: prose. The strategy is very simple: if you can show that you can put list $(a)$ and list $(f)$ in one to one correspondence by only using the lists $(b)-(e)$ , then you can be said to have shown that $m=n$ . The lists $(a)$ and $(b)$ are in a one to one correspondence through the rule $i\mapsto H_i/H_{i+1}$ . Moreover, $(b)$ and its surrogate list in $(c)$ are also bijectively connected, e.g. by the map which sends each $H_i$ to the $H'_j$ such that $H_i=H'_j$ where $j$ is the maximal of the set of all such indices (you can probably do this in some other way too); denote it by $r_i$ . One can connect the lists $(f)$ , $(e)$ and $(d)$ in a similar manner. That leaves us with $(c)$ and $(d)$ . I don't see how these two lists can be connected other than by using the identifications sanctioned by $\psi$ . For example: I will send $H_i/H_{i+1}$ to $H'_{r_i}/H'_{r_{i}+1}$ which is itself sent to $K'_{\psi(r_i)}/K'_{\psi(r_i)+1}$ etc. Hence, if we can put surrogates of $(b)$ in $(c)$ and those of $(e)$ in $(d)$ in one-to-one correspondence, we are done.—But.—As the author of the submitted answer has already admitted, it is possible, by using $\psi$ , to take two different elements of list $(a)$ to the same element of list $(d)$ . Well then, better say goodbye to our bijection showing $m=n$ . That $\psi$ only allows nontrivial to nontrivial is irrelevant to this particular issue: because it can do so—wait for it—trivially, e.g. by allowing us to send every nontrivial element of $(c)$ to one particular nontrivial element of $(d)$ (since one can identify different members of a series with each other). Incidentally, this shows why the ""identifications"" don't give us a very robust method of counting in this case. The question is whether the correspondence between the surrogates of the elements of $(b)$ in $(c)$ and those of the elements of $(e)$ in $(d)$ is, according to $\psi$ , unique. In the absence of uniqueness of the partial correspondence between $(c)$ and $(d)$ , how else can one use $\psi$ to connect $(b)$ and $(e)$ ? Merely asserting ""just use $\psi$ !"" won't do; you have to specify the manner in which one has to use $\psi$ exactly. This sums up the lack clarity present in Lang's proof and the post below. This is what I wanted cleared up with a standard set theoretic proof. We seem to have so many testimonies, but, strangely, very little actual evidence. I am sure that such a bijection exists (cumbersome or not), though a little more honesty would perhaps make us admit that it is not near at hand. Quite simply, the method  suggested  is inadequate. A last word: I do not approve of recycling the constructions involved in Schreier. You can invoke Schreier as an existential theorem.
