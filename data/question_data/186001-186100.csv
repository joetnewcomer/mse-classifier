The goal of this proof is to conclude with the statement that $\forall x \in X, (g \circ f (x)) = (((g\circ f)^{-1})^{-1}(x))$ . This is the definition of function equality. Also, just for clarity: $f: X \to Y$ and $g:Y \to Z$ Here is what I know from prior exercises and prior proofs in the book: $(g\circ f)$ is bijective $(g \circ f)^{-1}$ is bijective $((g \circ f)^{-1})^{-1}$ is bijective $(g \circ f)^{-1}(g \circ f \ (x)) = x$ $(g \circ f)^{-1}(((g \circ f)^{-1})^{-1}\ (x))=x$ The proof is as follows: From $4$ and $5$ we know that: $(g \circ f)^{-1}(g \circ f \ (x)) = (g \circ f)^{-1}(((g \circ f)^{-1})^{-1}\ (x))$ From $2$ , we have the following statement: $\forall z \in Z$ if $(g \circ f)^{-1}(z)=(g \circ f)^{-1}(z')$ , then $z=z'$ .

20,Functions $f$ such that for any polynomial $P$ the equation $f(x) = P(x)$ has at most $\deg P + 1$ solutions,Functions  such that for any polynomial  the equation  has at most  solutions,f P f(x) = P(x) \deg P + 1,"I would like to characterize the set $S$ of continuous functions $f \colon I \to \mathbb R$ such that for any $n \ge 0$ and for any polynomial $P$ of degree $n$ , the equation $f(x) = P(x)$ has at most $n+1$ solutions. Here $I$ is a generic non-degenerate interval of $\mathbb R$ , i.e. two functions in $S$ might be defined on different intervals. In order to do so, I found it useful to recall the following: Lemma . Let $g \colon I \to \mathbb R$ be continuously differentiable. If $g'$ has at most $n$ zeros in $I$ , then $g$ has at most $n+1$ zeros in $I$ . Proof : Since $g'$ has at most $n$ zeros, there exists $m \le n$ and there exist $m+1$ intervals $[x_0 = \inf I, x_1], [x_1, x_2], \dotsc, [x_m, x_{m+1} = \sup I]$ such that $g'$ keeps the same sign in any $[x_i, x_{i+1}]$ . Therefore, $g$ is monotonic in each $[x_i, x_{i+1}]$ , and thus has at most one zero in each $[x_i, x_{i+1}]$ . What I have found so far about $S$ : If $f \in S$ , then $f$ is injective (and so monotonic). Proof : Let $y \in \mathbb R$ . Since $P(x) = y$ is a polynomial of degree $0$ and $f \in S$ , the equation $f(x) = y$ has at most $1$ solution. If $f$ is injective and $f' \in S$ , then $f \in S$ . Proof : Let $P$ be a polynomial of degree $n > 0$ . Since $P'$ has degree $n-1$ and $f' \in S$ , then $f'(x) - P'(x)$ has at most $n$ zeros, so by the lemma $f(x) - P(x)$ has at most $n+1$ zeros. $e^x \in S$ . Proof : By induction on $n$ . The case $n = 0$ follows by injectivity. Let $n > 0$ and $P(x)$ be a polynomial of degree $n$ . By the inductive hypothesis, $e^x - P'(x)$ has at most $n$ zeros, so by the lemma $e^x - P(x)$ has at most $n+1$ zeros. $\ln x \in S$ . Proof : Let $n \ge 0$ and $P(x)$ be a polynomial of degree $n$ . Then $1 - x P'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $n$ and therefore has at most $n$ zeros, and so $\frac 1 x - P'(x)$ also has at most $n$ zeros. Again, by the lemma it follows that $\ln x - P(x)$ has at most $n+1$ zeros. If $f \in S$ and $g(x) = a f(x) + b$ for some $a, b \in \mathbb R$ with $a \neq 0$ , then $g \in S$ . If $f \in S$ and $g(x) = f(a x + b)$ for some $a, b \in \mathbb R$ with $a \neq 0$ , then $g \in S$ . Clearly, no polynomial belongs to $S$ . Also, $\arcsin x$ , $\arccos x$ , and $\arctan x$ don't belong to $S$ . Is there a simple characterization of $S$ ? I don't mind restricting $S$ to differentiable or even smooth functions if it proves necessary to provide a simple characterization.","I would like to characterize the set of continuous functions such that for any and for any polynomial of degree , the equation has at most solutions.

25,The behaviour of functions nested under themselves outwith their domains,The behaviour of functions nested under themselves outwith their domains,,"This question follows from some interesting observations on a sum of reciprocals . Instead of summing them however, we will place each fraction to make a continued fraction. Some visualisations on Desmos on nested functions have led to the following observations/questions. In particular, we will focus on nests that exhibit cycles, and hence a closed form for the functions in consideration can be deduced. Some issues arising from this will also be discussed. Let us firstly start with the function $$f(x)=\frac1{1+\frac x{1+\frac x{1+\cdots}}}\implies \frac1{f(x)}=1+xf(x)\implies f(x)=\frac{-1+\sqrt{1+4x}}{2x}$$ where we take the positive root as $f(x)>0$ for $x>0$ . The domain is $x\in\left[-\frac14,\infty\right)\setminus\{0\}$ , meaning that the closed form does not represent the values when $x<0$ .

Then $f$ has compact support in $\mathbb{R}^2$, $f$ is continuous except at $(0, 0)$, and $\int dy \int f(x, y) dx = 0$ but $\int dx \int f(x, y) dy = 1$. Observe that $f$ is unbounded in every neighborhood of $(0, 0)$. Progress First, note that the supports of the $\phi_i$ are disjoint. Suppose $\phi_i (x) \neq 0$ on the set $S_i$ for each $i$. Then if $x \not\in \displaystyle\cup_{i = 1}^\infty S_i$, or if $y \not\in \displaystyle\cup_{i = 1}^\infty S_i$ we have $f(x, y) = 0$. If $x \in S_i$ for some $i$ then $x \not\in S_j$ for $j \neq i$, so $f(x, y) = -\phi_i (x) \phi_{i-1} (y) + \phi_i (x) \phi_{i} (y) = \phi_i(x) [\phi_{i} (y) - \phi_{i-1} (y)]$. Note that $f(0, 0) = 0$ since $0$ is not in the support of any $\phi_i$. Then if we can show that $f$ is unbounded in every neighborhood of $(0, 0)$, by the epsilon-delta definition of continuity we know that $f$ is not continuous at $(0, 0)$. Since $\int \phi_i = 1$ we know that the support for each $\phi_i$ must be non-empty. Examine the neighborhood of radius $r$ centered at $(0, 0)$. If we can show that $f$ is unbounded on any neighborhood of radius $r < 1$ centered at $(0, 0)$, then by extension it is unbounded on any neighborhood of radius $r \ge 1$ centered at $(0, 0)$. Then suppose $2^{-a} \le r < 2^{1-a}$. Suppose for sake of contradiction that $f$ is bounded in this neighborhood. Then let $\alpha, \beta$ be the values in $\mathbb{R}^1$ such that $f(\alpha, \beta) \ge f(x, y)$ for all $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^1$ with $|(x, y) - (0, 0)| < r$. Suppose $\alpha \in S_i$. We must then have $\beta \in S_{i-1}$ or $\beta \in S_{i}$. If $\beta \in S_{i-1}$ then $f(\alpha, \beta) = -\phi_i (\alpha) \phi_{i-1} (\beta)$, and if $\beta \in S_i$ then $f(\alpha, \beta) = \phi_i (\alpha) \phi_i (\beta)$. ( ~~~ I don't know how to proceed from here. I need to generate an ordered pair in $\mathbb{R}^2$ that creates a larger value for $f$, but I don't know how to judge the magnitude of $\phi_i (\alpha), \phi_i (\beta)$, or $\phi_{i-1} (\beta)$. I think I need to use $\int \phi_i = 1$, but to be totally honest I don't know what that means, or how to use it. ~~~ ) Since the $\phi_i$ are continuous, we know that the $S_i$ are collections of intervals. Then $(0, 1) \backslash \cup_{i = 1}^\infty S_i$ is also a collection of intervals. We showed earlier that $f(x, y) \neq 0$ iff for some $i$ we have $x \in S_i$ and $y \in S_{i} \cup S_{i - 1}$. Then $f(x, y) \neq 0$ over a set whose closure is a collection of $2$-cells, implying by definition that the support of $f(x, y)$ is a collection of $2$-cells. Since $2$-cells are compact and the union of a collection of compact sets is compact, the support of $f(x, y)$ is compact. To show that $f$ is continuous (other than at the origin), we can examine $f$'s behavior in cases. If $x > 1$ or $x < 0$ and $y > 1$ or $y < 0$, then we can construct a disc in $\mathbb{R}^2$ centered at $(x, y)$ that does not intersect the set determined by $0 < x, y < 1$, so $f(x, y) = 0$ on this neighborhood since $\cup_{i = 1}^\infty S_i \subseteq (0, 1)$; this satisfies the epsilon-delta definition of continuity. If $x = 1$ or $y = 1$ then $f(x, y) = 0$. Since $S_1$ is a collection of intervals in $\mathbb{R}^1$, it has a maximum; let it be $s$. Since $\overline{S_1} \in (1/2, 1)$, and since $\overline{S_1}$ is a collection of closed intervals, we know that $s < 1$. Then if $x = 1$ or $y = 1$, we have that $f(x, y) = 0$ on the neighborhood centered at $(x, y)$ with radius $1-s$. This satisfies the epsilon-delta definition of continuity. Else if $x = 0$ and $y \neq 0$ then $f(x, y) = 0$. Suppose $y \in S_i$ for some $i$; then it is in some interval $[a, b] \in S_i$. Then consider the region defined by $(x', y') : x' < 2^{-(i+1)}, y' \in [a, b]$. We can inscribe a disk in this region centered at $(x, y)$, and we have $f(x', y') = 0$ over this region. This satisfies the epsilon-delta definition of continuity. On the other hand, suppose $y \not\in S_i$ for any $i$; then it is in some interval $[a, b]$ such that $\phi_i (y) = 0$ for all $y \in [a, b]$. Through a similar construction we can create a disk over which $f$ takes the value of zero alone. This satisfies the epsilon-delta definition of continuity. Else if $y = 0$ and $x \neq 0$ then $f(x, y) = 0$. Suppose $x \in S_i$ for some $i$; then it is in some interval $[a, b] \in S_i$. Then consider the region defined by $(x', y') : x' \in [a, b], y' < 2^{-i}$. We can inscribe a disk in this region centered at $(x, y)$, and we have $f(x', y') = 0$ over this region. This satisfies the epsilon-delta definition of continuity. On the other hand, suppose $x \not\in S_i$ for any $i$; then it is in some interval $[a, b]$ such that $\phi_i (x) = 0$ for all $x \in [a, b]$. Through a similar construction we can create a disk over which $f$ takes the value of zero alone. This satisfies the epsilon-delta definition of continuity. This shows the continuity of $f$ on all points other than $(0, 0)$.
