Here's the gist: normally with infinitesimal point charges, there is an electric field (represented by vectors everywhere in space) that points radially outward from the position of the point, and its magnitude falls off as $\frac{1}{r^2}$. Here is the whole equation for you just to give you some background: $$E = \frac{q}{4*\pi*\epsilon_0*r^2}$$ Where $q$ and $\epsilon_0$ are just constants. Now imagine a continuous straight line of these infinitesimally small particles, giving it one dimension. I am trying to find the electric field at one point as a product of all these particles integrated together (from infinity to negative infinity). As my variable in the integration, ill use $x$ - the length of the wire traversed so far. And to replace $q$, ill use $\lambda*dx$, making $\lambda$ a constant density of charge per unit length (simulating the point charges as $dx$ approaches 0). Now this means that $r$ will turn into more of a Pythagorean theorem, as we are trying to find the electric field at one point caused from the whole wire. To replace $r$, ill use $l$ and $x$ ($l$ being the perpendicular length away from the wire). Thus $r$ then becomes $\sqrt{x^2+l^2}$. Now here's where it gets a little tricky. The electric field calculated from each point is a vector , and points in a direction. But because we have a one dimensional wire as the source of each field, that means that the E-field caused from $x$ will cancel out the field caused from $-x$ (but it won't cancel out the e-field in the direction perpindicular to the wire). For this we just multiply the magnitude of the electric field by $cos(\theta)$, with $\theta$ being the angle difference between the normal vector (90 degrees, perpindicular to the wire) and the electric field vector. Now an even more fun problem! How do we get $\theta$? Through the inverse tangent of $x$ and $l$! And what do we end up getting? $$\cos(\theta) = \cos(\arctan(x/l)) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+(x/l)^2}}$$ But the thing is that there are two sides that cancel out, doubling the value we get from the cosine. So now let's recap. Here is the revised equation so far: $$E = \frac{\lambda*dx}{2*\pi*\epsilon_0*\sqrt{x^2+l^2}^2*\sqrt{1+(x/l)^2}}$$ $\sqrt{x^2+l^2}^2$ simplifies to $(x^2+l^2)$, and $\sqrt{1+(x/l)^2}$ simplifies to $\frac{\sqrt{l^2+x^2}}{l}$. Thus, the whole equation is now $$E = \frac{\lambda*dx*l}{2*\pi*\epsilon_0*(x^2+l^2)^{3/2}}$$ Where $\lambda$ and $\epsilon_0$ are constants. Now my question is, ""what is the integration of this function over infinity, and how do I do it?"". $$\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{\lambda\cdot dx\cdot l}{2\pi\epsilon_0(x^2+l^2)^{3/2}}$$ I really appreciate your help or any tips!

Here is the revised equation so far: $$E = \frac{\lambda*dx}{2*\pi*\epsilon_0*\sqrt{x^2+l^2}^2*\sqrt{1+(x/l)^2}}$$ $\sqrt{x^2+l^2}^2$ simplifies to $(x^2+l^2)$, and $\sqrt{1+(x/l)^2}$ simplifies to $\frac{\sqrt{l^2+x^2}}{l}$. Thus, the whole equation is now $$E = \frac{\lambda*dx*l}{2*\pi*\epsilon_0*(x^2+l^2)^{3/2}}$$ Where $\lambda$ and $\epsilon_0$ are constants. Now my question is, ""what is the integration of this function over infinity, and how do I do it?"". $$\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{\lambda\cdot dx\cdot l}{2\pi\epsilon_0(x^2+l^2)^{3/2}}$$ I really appreciate your help or any tips!

I then want to translate this formula into python code (please feel free to skip this part in the answer, I am mainly trying to figure out the process). If you do want to include code, please do not worry about memory or time performance. Known Information The points A, B, and C in 3D coordinates. The pan/tilt angles between the light/observer relative to an local up and forward vector. Background Info Using a DMX light (a light with motors built into it), I can find the exact local pan and tilt rotation to point the light at any object in a room by manually adjusting values until the angle is correct. Because these lights use stepper motors the exact angle can be determined to point the light in the correct direction. The origin point in the room is chosen arbitrarily, and the position of the points is measured in the real world using a laser measure and can be accurate to about 10mm.

58,Is it possible to calculate the angle between two observers given their angles to three of the same points?,Is it possible to calculate the angle between two observers given their angles to three of the same points?,,"Given the image below, is it possible to calculate the angles E and/or F given the angles $A,B,C$ and $D$ ?

The three points are the same real-world points for both observers, but the exact location (distance etc) of both points is unknown. Is it possible to calculate the angle $E$ and/or $F$ here? It feels like this should be possible but I'm not entirely sure if and how. The reason I think this is that given the two measured angles, there's only one possible position for the observer to be (if the points were in a straight line, there could be another point on the other side of the line but let's disregard that for now). Given that we have the two observer points for which we know that there is only one possible location, it feels like it should be possible to then calculate the angle between the two of them.","Given the image below, is it possible to calculate the angles E and/or F given the angles and ?

No problem, I would normally change strategies and use a double 45 (45+45) to cut neatly in front of the pipe to the adjacent wall.

99,How can we show $\sum_{n\in\mathbb N}\frac{1-\cos\frac xn}{2^{n+1}}=0$ iff $x=0$?,How can we show  iff ?,\sum_{n\in\mathbb N}\frac{1-\cos\frac xn}{2^{n+1}}=0 x=0,"Let $$g(x):=\sum_{n\in\mathbb N}\frac{1-\cos\frac xn}{2^{n+1}}\;\;\;\text{for }x\in\mathbb R.$$ How do we see that $g(x)=0$ if and only if $x=0$ ? Clearly, $g(x)\in[0,1]$ for all $x\in\mathbb R$ and $g$ is continuous. Now, if we want to find $x\in\mathbb R$ with $g(x)=0$ , we should want the cosine terms to be equal to $1$ ; but this should mean that for all $n\in\mathbb N$ there is a $k_n\in\mathbb Z$ with $\frac xn=2k_n\pi$ ... How do we see that this is impossible, unless $x=0$ (if this is the right approach at all)? And how do we see that there are no other zeros?","Let How do we see that if and only if ?
