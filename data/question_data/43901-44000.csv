0,About the Schur's lemma,About the Schur's lemma,,"In modules we have the following result: If $M$ is a simple $R$-module then $End_R M$ is a division ring.

2,Tiling a rectangle and tensor products,Tiling a rectangle and tensor products,,"Consider the following theorem: Whenever a rectangle is tiled by rectangles each of which has at least one integer side, then the tiled rectangle has at least one integer side. There is a paper by Stan Wagon with fourteen proofs of this result. If we replace integer by rational, then it is possible to prove this result using tensor products. Sketch of a proof: ($\otimes = \otimes_\mathbb{Q}$) Let $a$ and $b$ the sides of the big rectangle and let $(a_i)$, $(b_i)$ the sides of the small rectangles. We have $a\otimes b=\sum a_i\otimes b_i$, using that each rectangle has a rational side we can rewrite this sum as $1\otimes c + d\otimes 1$.

25,When does a polynomial take all possible residues modulo any integer?,When does a polynomial take all possible residues modulo any integer?,,"(This question is inspired by a question about remainders of binomial coefficients I asked recently.) Consider the polynomial maps $f:\ \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}$. These include the polynomials with integer coefficients, but also functions like $f(x) = \frac{x(x-1)}{2} = \binom{x}{2}$. One can show that any such polynomial map $\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}$ is a $\mathbb{Z}$-linear combination of the polynomials $\binom{x}{d}$ for $d \in \mathbb{N}$. I am interested in polynomial maps which take on all residues modulo all integers. More precisely, a polynomial $f$ is interesting for me if for any integer $m \geq 2$ and for any integer $0 \leq r < m$ there exists an integer $n$ with $f(n) \equiv r \pmod{m}$. One such polynomial is $f(x) = x$. As explained in the mentioned other questions, polynomials $f(x) = x^d$ don't have the aforementioned property (for $d > 1$). I had a (naive) hope that the polynomials ${x \choose d}$ would do the trick, but they don't work either. After some more thought, I discovered that degree $2$ polynomials can never work. This is because for $f(x) = ax^2 +bx +c$ the condition $f(n) \equiv r \pmod{p}$ can be rewritten as $$\left(n+\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 \equiv \frac{1}{a}\left(r-c+\frac{b^2}{4a}\right) \pmod{p}$$ (assuming numerators and denumerators of $a,b,c$ are coprime to $p$). Hence, $f(n)$ does not have the residue $r$ if $p$ is large enough and $\frac{1}{a}\left(r-c+\frac{b^2}{4a}\right)$ is not a quadratic residue modulo $p$. This leaves me doubtful about polynomials of higher degrees. I can't think of a general argument or an example of an interesting polynomial, though.

I can readily establish that $\psi$ is an injective homomorphism that is surjective to its image in $M_{n}(F)$ and since $K$ is a field, every nonzero $\alpha\in K$ has an inverse $\alpha^{-1}\in K$ so that $\psi(\alpha^{-1})=\psi(\alpha)^{-1}\in M_{n}(F)$. So this establishes an isomorphism between $K$ and the image of $K$ under $\psi$. This is the part that I'm confused about: the elements in $\text{im}\,(\psi)$ are elements of the noncommutative ring of $n\times n$ matrices over $F$. How is it that $\text{im}\,(\psi)$ is a subfield of $M_{n}(F)$ if a subfield is commutative and $M_{n}(F)$ is a noncommutative ring? I should mention that I'm an undergraduate student in a graduate Galois Theory course and my linear algebra is a bit weak.  So if I've left out some important or illuminating details I'd greatly appreciate having them pointed out.",,"['abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"

So we consider: Case I: Order of $Z(G)$ is $p^2$ i.e., $|Z(G)|=p^2$ The class equation is given by $|G|=|Z(G)|+\Sigma|G:C_G(g_i)|$ , where the $g_i$ are representatives of the distinct conjugacy classes of G not contained in the center $Z(G).$ I deduced that for each $g\notin Z(G),$ $|G:C_G(g)|=p.$ So the class equation becomes $p^4=p^2+kp,$ where $k$ is the number of distinct conjugacy classes not contained in the center. This gives $k=p^3-p$ and hence the number of conjugacy classes of $G$ is $p^3+p^2-p$ Case II: $|Z(G)|=p$ I was able to prove that for any $g\notin Z(G),|G:C_G(g)|=p$ or $p^2.$ That means that, a conjugacy class not contained in the center can have size $p$ or $p^2.$ My question is: Is there any way to determine how many conjugacy classes of size $p$ is there, and how many conjugacy classes of size $p^2$ is there?

Because $$g = f/(X-\alpha_1) = X^2 + \alpha_1 X + \alpha_1^2 - 135$$ and $$g = (X-\alpha_2) (X - \alpha_3) = X^2 - (\alpha_2 + \alpha_3) X + \alpha_2 \alpha_3,$$ we obtain the relations $$\alpha_2 \alpha_3 = \alpha_1^2 -135 \quad \text{and} \quad \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 = - \alpha_1.$$ Now let $\lambda = \frac{\alpha_3 - \alpha_1}{\alpha_2 - \alpha_1} \in L$ .

I have an elliptic curve $$ Y^2 = X (X-1)(X-\bar{\lambda}) $$ over $\mathbb{F}_5$ (the residue field of $L$ ) and need to count points over $\mathbb{F}_5$ . Therefore, I need to know what exactly $\bar{\lambda}$ is. What did I do to approach my problem? By computing the Newton polygons of $F$ and $h := g(X+\alpha_1) = (X - (\alpha_2 - \alpha_1))(X - (\alpha_3 - \alpha_1))$ , I was able to compute the valuations of their roots $\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\alpha_3$ (roots of $f$ ) and $n := \alpha_2 - \alpha_1, z := \alpha_3 - \alpha_1$ (roots of $h$ ) which are all $1/3$ (assuming $v(5) = 1$ ). This implies that the valuation of $\lambda$ is $0$ , so $\bar{\lambda} \neq 0$ . Another approach was using $\alpha_2 = \alpha_1 - \alpha_3$ (follows from the observation above) which gives $$ \lambda = \frac{\alpha_3-\alpha_1}{-\alpha_3} = -1 + \frac{\alpha_1}{\alpha_3}. $$ Here, we also have a fraction where both enumerator and denominator have valuations $1/3$ , respectively, but maybe this is better to work with.

76,Trace map from finite surjective morphism of normal irreducible varieties,Trace map from finite surjective morphism of normal irreducible varieties,,"I am trying to understand why if $f: Y \rightarrow X$ is a finite surjective morphism of normal (irreducible) complex varieties, there is a trace-map $f_{\ast} \mathcal{O}_Y \rightarrow \mathcal{O}_X$ splitting the natural inclusion in the other direction.

86,Classifying groups of order 585,Classifying groups of order 585,,"I am trying to classify the groups of order 585. (It is known that there are 4 of distinct non-isomorphic groups, but I am not assuming it.) The question further asks to show that any group of this size has a cyclic subgroup of prime index, and the center is non-trivial with a composite order. My attempt so far: Note that $|{G}|=585=3^2\cdot 5\cdot 13$. By Sylow, $n_3\in \{1,13\}$, $n_5=1$, and $n_{13}=1$. Denote by $S_{3}$, $S_5$, $S_{13}$, the Sylow subgroups of respective order. It then follows that $S_5\cong \mathbb{Z}_5$, $S_{13}\cong \mathbb{Z}_{13}$, and $S_3$ is isomorphic to either $\mathbb{Z}_9$ or $\mathbb{Z}_3\times\mathbb{Z}_3$. Take $\mathbb{Z}_5\times \mathbb{Z}_{13}$. This is a normal subgroup that is cyclic (but not with prime index), hence all groups of order 585 are either of the form $(\mathbb{Z}_5\times \mathbb{Z}_{13})\rtimes \mathbb{Z}_9$ $(\mathbb{Z}_5\times \mathbb{Z}_{13})\rtimes (\mathbb{Z}_3\times\mathbb{Z}_3)$. The immediate ones are: (i) $\mathbb{Z}_5\times \mathbb{Z}_{13}\times \mathbb{Z}_9$ (ii) $\mathbb{Z}_5\times \mathbb{Z}_{13}\times \mathbb{Z}_3\times \mathbb{Z}_3$ These clearly have cyclic subgroups of prime index, namely, $\mathbb{Z}_{13}\times \mathbb{Z}_9$ (or $\mathbb{Z}_5\times \mathbb{Z}_9$) and $\mathbb{Z}_5\times \mathbb{Z}_{13}\times \mathbb{Z}_3$. Also, these are abelian groups, so they obviously have non-trivial center of composite order (namely, 585). Okay, let's find then the non-trivial semi-direct products. To investigate the Case 1, we need to identify the homomorphisms $\varphi:\mathbb{Z}_9\to\mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb{Z}_5\times \mathbb{Z}_{13})\cong\mathbb{Z}_5^*\times\mathbb{Z}_{13}^*$. Since $|\varphi(1)|\mid 9$, it follows that the only non-trivial homomorphism is given by $1\mapsto (1,3)$. This gives rise to the presentation $$ <a,b,c,d:a^5=b^{13}=c^9=e,ab=ba,ac=ca,cbc^{-1}=b^3>. $$ This has a cyclic subgroup generated by $ac$ whose index is 13. This group has a non-trivial center since $a\in Z(G)$. Moreover, the order of $Z(G)$ is composite since it also contains $c^3$: $c^3bc^{-3}=b^{27}=b$. Hence the order of $Z(G)$ is divisible by 15. Let's move on to the Case 2 where $G$ is given by $(\mathbb{Z}_5\times \mathbb{Z}_{13})\rtimes (\mathbb{Z}_3\times\mathbb{Z}_3)$. To define the homomorphism, we need to determine where such a homomorphism sends $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$ of $\mathbb{Z}_3\times\mathbb{Z}_3$. By the same logic, we determine that either $(1,0)\mapsto (1,3);\,(0,1)\mapsto (1,1)$ OR $(1,0)\mapsto (1,3);\,(0,1)\mapsto (1,3)$. The map $(1,0)\mapsto (1,1);(0,1)\mapsto (1,3)$ gives rise to an isomorphic group. The corresponding presentations are: $$ \begin{split} <a,b,c,d &:a^5=b^{13}=c^3=d^3=e,ab=ba,cd=dc,ac=ca,bc=cb,ad=da\\ &;dbd^{-1}=b^3>, \end{split} $$ (namely, $a$ commutes with everything, but $b$ only commutes with $a$ and $c$) and $$ \begin{split} <a,b,c,d &:a^5=b^{13}=c^3=d^3=e,ab=ba,ac=ca,ad=da,cd=dc\\ &;cbc^{-1}=b^3,dbd^{-1}=b^3>. \end{split} $$ Here is where I have the problem (by cheating, shamefully): These two better be isomorphic!

The immediate ones are: (i) $\mathbb{Z}_5\times \mathbb{Z}_{13}\times \mathbb{Z}_9$ (ii) $\mathbb{Z}_5\times \mathbb{Z}_{13}\times \mathbb{Z}_3\times \mathbb{Z}_3$ These clearly have cyclic subgroups of prime index, namely, $\mathbb{Z}_{13}\times \mathbb{Z}_9$ (or $\mathbb{Z}_5\times \mathbb{Z}_9$) and $\mathbb{Z}_5\times \mathbb{Z}_{13}\times \mathbb{Z}_3$. Also, these are abelian groups, so they obviously have non-trivial center of composite order (namely, 585). Okay, let's find then the non-trivial semi-direct products. To investigate the Case 1, we need to identify the homomorphisms $\varphi:\mathbb{Z}_9\to\mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb{Z}_5\times \mathbb{Z}_{13})\cong\mathbb{Z}_5^*\times\mathbb{Z}_{13}^*$. Since $|\varphi(1)|\mid 9$, it follows that the only non-trivial homomorphism is given by $1\mapsto (1,3)$. This gives rise to the presentation $$ <a,b,c,d:a^5=b^{13}=c^9=e,ab=ba,ac=ca,cbc^{-1}=b^3>. $$ This has a cyclic subgroup generated by $ac$ whose index is 13. This group has a non-trivial center since $a\in Z(G)$. Moreover, the order of $Z(G)$ is composite since it also contains $c^3$: $c^3bc^{-3}=b^{27}=b$. Hence the order of $Z(G)$ is divisible by 15. Let's move on to the Case 2 where $G$ is given by $(\mathbb{Z}_5\times \mathbb{Z}_{13})\rtimes (\mathbb{Z}_3\times\mathbb{Z}_3)$. To define the homomorphism, we need to determine where such a homomorphism sends $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$ of $\mathbb{Z}_3\times\mathbb{Z}_3$. By the same logic, we determine that either $(1,0)\mapsto (1,3);\,(0,1)\mapsto (1,1)$ OR $(1,0)\mapsto (1,3);\,(0,1)\mapsto (1,3)$. The map $(1,0)\mapsto (1,1);(0,1)\mapsto (1,3)$ gives rise to an isomorphic group. The corresponding presentations are: $$ \begin{split} <a,b,c,d &:a^5=b^{13}=c^3=d^3=e,ab=ba,cd=dc,ac=ca,bc=cb,ad=da\\ &;dbd^{-1}=b^3>, \end{split} $$ (namely, $a$ commutes with everything, but $b$ only commutes with $a$ and $c$) and $$ \begin{split} <a,b,c,d &:a^5=b^{13}=c^3=d^3=e,ab=ba,ac=ca,ad=da,cd=dc\\ &;cbc^{-1}=b^3,dbd^{-1}=b^3>. \end{split} $$ Here is where I have the problem (by cheating, shamefully): These two better be isomorphic!

I tried to solve a problem and explain my reasoning to see where are the holes in my understanding and to see if there's some other ways of thinking about it or suggestions for these type of problems. The problem I tried to solve is the following: Find the simple submodules of $\mathbb{C[Q_8]}$ (up to isomorphism). First by Maschke's theorem I know that the group algebra is semisimple because char( $\mathbb{C}$ ) doesn't divide char( $\mathbb{Q_8}$ ). This means I can now use Wedderburn's theorem as it's a finite dimensional algebra. By this theorem I have the following decomposition: $$ \mathbb{C[Q_8]} \simeq \prod_{i \in I} M_{n_i}(\mathbb{C})$$ As it's an isomorphism, they both must have the same dimensions over $\mathbb{C}$ . The dimension of $\mathbb{C[Q_8]}$ over $\mathbb{C}$ is 8. This implies that the only possible dimensions of the matrices algebras are $n_1=2,n_2=1,n_3=1,n_4=1,n_5=1$ because otherwise if $n_i = 1$ for $i \in \{ 1,...,8\}$ this would imply $\mathbb{C[Q_8]}$ is commutative which would imply $\mathbb{Q_8}$ is abelian as a group. The other cases $n_1 = 2, n_2 = 2$ cannot happen as there is always a submodule of a group algebra of dimension 1 (the one generated by $\sum_{h \in \mathbb{Q_8}} h$ , is this correct?). To find these subspaces isomorphic to $\mathbb{C}$ I considered the $x \in \mathbb{C[Q_8]}$ such that $i*x,  j*x,  k*x$ is a complex multiple of $x$ . From these I found the four subspaces, one of them being the one that's guaranteed to exist. My problem is I can't seem to find the subspace isomorphic to $M_2(\mathbb{C})$ . Any tips and help would be greatly apreciated. I tried to solve the problem in another way. I read on the internet but couldn't prove it that $dim_{\mathbb{C}} Z(\mathbb{C[Q_8]}) = \# \text {conjugacy classes of  $\mathbb{Q_8}$}$ . I haven't worked that much with conjugacy classes but I gave it a try in this problem as I have seen that also, $dim_{\mathbb{C}} Z(\mathbb{C[Q_8]}) = \# \text {simples in the Wedderburn decomposition }$ . By this I understood the number of matrices algebras in the product that is isomorphic to the algebra $\mathbb{C[Q_8]}$ . In this particular case, the conjugacy classes I found are 5: the conjugacy class of $\{1\}$ and $\{-1\}$ as they both are in the center of the group. For each $i,j,k$ I found they are on their own conjugacy class. So indeed, the number of conjugacy classes is the same as the number of matrices algebras in the product, i.e 5. One question I have is if from these conjugacy classes I can get more information about these matrices algebras or they just determine the number of them in the product? I would very happy if someone could point me to notes or books that explain these theorem and if possible with exercises similar to the one I asked.

96,On the definition of Euclidean domain,On the definition of Euclidean domain,,"Typically, a Euclidean domain is defined to be an integral domain which admits a function defined on all nonzero elements whose values on the set of all non-negative integers. Some author requires additional condition which says that for every nonzero elements $a$, $b$ the value of the function at $ab$ is no less than that at $a$. One may use those properties to prove that every ED is a PID, and by the theorem which says that PID is UFD one gets that every ED is a UFD. Sometimes, it is required to prove ED is UFD without the concept of PID. However, hard part appears to be that every elements in ED can be written as a finite product of irreducibles. For me, it is unavoidable to pass through PID argument. However, as most ED function satisfies, if we have that the value of the function at a nonzero element is strictly larger than that at a proper divisor (non-unit, not associated), then typical least value argument provides that in the domain every elements can be factored into irreducibles. My question is that is there any ED which does not admit any ED function with the above stronger property.","Typically, a Euclidean domain is defined to be an integral domain which admits a function defined on all nonzero elements whose values on the set of all non-negative integers. Some author requires additional condition which says that for every nonzero elements $a$, $b$ the value of the function at $ab$ is no less than that at $a$. One may use those properties to prove that every ED is a PID, and by the theorem which says that PID is UFD one gets that every ED is a UFD. Sometimes, it is required to prove ED is UFD without the concept of PID. However, hard part appears to be that every elements in ED can be written as a finite product of irreducibles.

97,Final step of exercise 11.7 from Atiyah-Macdonald ($\dim A[x]=\dim A+1$),Final step of exercise 11.7 from Atiyah-Macdonald (),\dim A[x]=\dim A+1,"Ex. 11.7 from Atiyah-Macdonald is basically to prove $\dim A[x]=\dim A+1$ for $A$ noetherian. From exercise 11.6, we get $\dim A[x]\geq\dim A+1$, so we are left to prove ""$\leq$"". I've followed the hint and proved that $\text{ht}(p[x])=\text{ht}(p)$ for every $p\subset A$ prime, but I'm still not sure why this implies $\dim A[x]\leq\dim A+1$. Here is what I've thought so far: if $P_1\subsetneq...\subsetneq P_k$ is a maximal chain in $A[x]$, then $P_k$ is maximal and $k=\dim A[x]$. Suppose that $m:=P_k\cap A$ is a maximal ideal of $A$. That way, $A/m$ is a field and $A[x]/m[x]\simeq A/m[x]$ is a P.I.D. Since $P_k$ is maximal, $\overline{P_k}\in A[x]/m[x]$ is maximal, so $\text{ht}(\overline{P_k})=1$, which means $P_k$ is minimal prime of $m[x]$. That way, $k=\text{ht}(P_k)=\text{ht}(m[x])+1=\text{ht}(m)+1\leq\dim A+1$. The problem with what I did is that it depends on $P_k\cap A$ being maximal. Is this necessarily the case? I feel like this is crucial, otherwise the hint wouldn't work. How do I prove that? If it isn't true, how can I conclude that $\dim A[x]\leq\dim A+1$?","Ex. 11.7 from Atiyah-Macdonald is basically to prove $\dim A[x]=\dim A+1$ for $A$ noetherian.

98,Does this Cartan-Eilenberg exercise contain a mistake?,Does this Cartan-Eilenberg exercise contain a mistake?,,"In Cartan and Eilenberg, Homological Algebra , Exercise 10, page 123, the last statement is the following: if $A\to B$ is a ring homomorphism such that $B$ is projective as an $A$-module, then for any $A$-module $M$ we have $$ \text{inj.dim}_B(B\otimes_AM)\leq \text{inj.dim}_A(M). $$ This immediately implies that if $B$ projective as an $A$-module and $M$ is an injective $A$-module, then $B\otimes_AM$ is an injective $B$-module. However, in this stack exchange question , @EricWofsey gave a counter-example: let $A=k[x]$ the polynomial ring over a field $k$ and $B=l[x]$ where $l/k$ is a non-algebraic field extension. Since $A$ and $B$ are PID's, a module is injective if and only if that module is divisible. Let $M=k(x)$ then $M$ is an injective $A$-module. But $B\otimes_A M=l\otimes_k k(x)$ is the subring of $l(x)$ consisting of rational functions which can be written with a denominator in $k[x]$. In particular if $t\in l$ is not algebraic over $k$, then $\frac{1}{x-t}\notin l\otimes_k k(x)$ but $x-t\in l\otimes_k k(x)$. Therefore $l\otimes_k k(x)$ is not divisible hence not injective as an $l[x]$-module. It seems that this gives a counter-example of Exercise 10.
