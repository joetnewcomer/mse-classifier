0,Rigorously evaluating $\lim\limits_{t\to 1^-}\int_{\sin^{-1}(t/2)}^{\sin^{-1}(t)}\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{t - \sin x}{\cos x}\right)dx$.,Rigorously evaluating .,\lim\limits_{t\to 1^-}\int_{\sin^{-1}(t/2)}^{\sin^{-1}(t)}\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{t - \sin x}{\cos x}\right)dx,"I'd like to find a way to rigorously evaluate the limit $$\lim\limits_{t\to 1^-}\int_{\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{t}{2}\right)}^{\sin^{-1}(t)}\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{t - \sin x}{\cos x}\right)dx$$ This limit arises when one attempts to solve the Basel problem by evaluating the integral $$I(t)=\int_0^t\int_0^t\frac{1}{1-xy}dydx$$ using two methods: (1) expanding the integrand as a geometric series, and (2) using the change of variables $x=(u-v)/\sqrt2$ , $y=(u+v)/\sqrt2$ . Doing so, we find that for every $t\in(-1,1)$ , $$I(t)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{t^{2n}}{n^2}$$ $$\text{ and }$$ $$I(t)=2\left(\sin^{-1}\frac{t}{2}\right)^2+4\int_{\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{t}{2}\right)}^{\sin^{-1}(t)}\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{t - \sin x}{\cos x}\right)dx$$ Now, the series $\sum t^{2n}/n^2$ evaluated at $t=1$ is $\sum 1/n^2$ . This series is convergent, so Abel's theorem implies that $I$ is continuous from the left at $1$ , and that $I(1)$ is the sum of the series $\sum 1/n^2$ (a similar conclusion can be reached for the value $-1$ ). Since $2\left(\sin^{-1} t/2\right)^2$ is continuous on $[-1,1]$ , it follows that the integral $$\int_{\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{t}{2}\right)}^{\sin^{-1}(t)}\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{t - \sin x}{\cos x}\right)dx = \frac{1}{4}\left(I(t)-2\left(\sin^{-1}\frac{t}{2}\right)^2\right)$$ is continuous on $[-1,1]$ , and that we should be able to compute $$\lim\limits_{t\to 1^-}\int_{\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{t}{2}\right)}^{\sin^{-1}(t)}\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{t - \sin x}{\cos x}\right)dx$$ by directly substituting in the value $t=1$ . I'm a bit skeptical about the validity of this reasoning, though. What makes me uncomfortable is the fact that the integrand of the resulting integral $$\int_{\frac{\pi}{6}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1-\sin x}{\cos x}\right)dx$$ has a singularity at $\pi/2$ , an element of the domain of integration, so the integrand has suddenly gone from being free of singularities to having one. Granted, the singularity in question is removable, but the fact that singularities aren't present for $t\in(-1,1)$ and that $I$ is continuous at $1$ really makes me wonder ""Why does the integrand suddenly accrue a singularity at $t=1$ ?"". Can someone reassure me that this procedure is valid, and, if you can, explain what's going on for $t=1$ ? If it's not valid, how can I rigorously evaluate the limit in question? Edit I should've mentioned this in the original post. Heuristically, I know that the limit is exactly $\pi^2/36$ . This follows from ""evaluating"" the limiting integral as follows: \begin{align*} \int_{\frac{\pi}{6}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1-\sin x}{\cos x}\right)dx &= \int_{\frac{\pi}{6}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1-\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-x\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-x\right)}\right)dx\\ &= \int_{\frac{\pi}{6}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\tan^{-1}\left(\tan \frac{\frac{\pi}{2}-x}{2}\right)dx\\ &= \int_{\frac{\pi}{6}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\left(\frac{\pi}{4}-\frac{x}{2}\right)dx\\ &= \frac{\pi^2}{36} \end{align*} What I'm more interested in is learning a way to establish this limit rigorously, provided that this integral method does not suffice.

9,Finding solution of the PDE : An Initial value problem,Finding solution of the PDE : An Initial value problem,,"I've been given a PDE of the form $$xu_x+(x^2+y)u_y=1-\left(\frac{y}{x}-x\right)u~~; ~~u(1,y)=0$$ Attempt : Firstly it's a first order linear PDE which has the general form $$a(x,y)u_x+b(x,y)u_y=c(x,y)u+d(x,y)$$ Where $a,b,c,d \in \mathcal{C}^1(\Omega)$ , where $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ (open and connected) and we also have $a^2+b^2 \neq 0$ on $\Omega_2$ . Then first of all the largest $\Omega_2$ on which $F:=a^2+b^2=x^2+(x^2+y)\neq 0$ is : $(x,y) \in \Omega_2\setminus \{(0,0)\}$ right? We have $s \mapsto \Gamma_s:=(f(s_0):=1,g(s_0):=s,h(s_0):=0))$ . Now, from transversality conditions we get : $$J:=\mathrm{det}\, \begin{pmatrix}a&f'\\b&g'\end{pmatrix}\Bigg{|}_{f(s_0),g(s_0),h(s_0)}=\mathrm{det}\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\1+s&1\end{pmatrix}=1$$ So we atleast expect solutions to exist $\textit{locally}$ for all $s \in (-\delta,\delta),\delta>0$ . Now to find the solutions explicitly i'll employ the method of characteristics: \begin{align}\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t}&=x~~;~x(0,s):=1 \implies x(t,s):=e^t\\\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}t}&=x^2+y~~;~ y(0,s):=s \\&=y+e^{2t} \end{align} Solving this we get \begin{align}   y(t,s)&=e^{2t}+c_2e^{t}~~;~y(0,s):=s \implies  y(t,s)=e^{t}\left(e^t+s-1\right)\end{align} Lastly \begin{align}\frac{\mathrm{d}z}{\mathrm{d}t}&=1-\left(\frac{y}{x}-x\right)z~~;~z(0,s):=0 \\&=1-\left(\frac{e^t(e^t+s-1)}{e^t}-e^t\right)z=1+(1-s)z\end{align} Which gives me $$z(t,s)=\frac{1}{s-1}\left(1-e^{t(1-s)}\right)$$ As the Jacobian was non-zero by inverse function theorem i can expect that i can invert the map $$(t,s)\mapsto \left(x(t,s),y(t,s)\right)$$ and i can solve $x=x(t,s),y=y(t,s)$ uniquely for $t$ and $s$ and the map $$(x,y)\mapsto \left(T(x,y);S(x,y)\right)$$ should be of class $\mathcal{C}^1$ . So i have $x(t,s)=e^t \implies t=\ln\,x=:T(x,y)$ and $y(t,s)=e^{\ln\,x}\left(e^{\ln \,x}+s-1\right)=x(x+s-1)$ i.e $s=(y/x)-x+1=:S(x,y)$ . From here i can write $$u=z(T(x,y),S(x,y))=\frac{x}{y-x^2}\left(1-x^{\frac{x^2-y}{x}}\right)$$ Which is valid when $y>x^2$ . I'm not sure about my workings here, appreciate any hints and help.

So let's assume that $f$ is continuous at $c$ , and maybe in a neighbourhood of $c$ . Since $q(x,y)=q(y,x)$ is symmetric, the limit along a line with slope $k$ is the same as with slope $1/k$ . So, without loss of generality, $0<|k|<1$ . If the limit is $0$ for two lines with slopes $k$ and $l$ , then it's also $0$ for a line with slope $k\cdot l$ : $$\lim_{x\to0}\frac{f(klx)-f(x)}{x}=\lim_{x\to0}\frac{f(klx)-f(lx)+f(lx)-f(x)}{x}$$ $$=l\cdot\lim_{lx\to0}\frac{f(klx)-f(lx)}{lx}+\lim_{x\to0}\frac{f(lx)-f(x)}{x}=0.$$ Thus, the limit is $0$ for any line with slope $k^n$ where $n\in\mathbb N$ .

Let $E$ be the set of all $x \in S$ at which $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} b_n x^n $ If $E$ has a limit point in $S$ , then $a_n = b_n $ for $n=0,1,2,\cdots$ . And here is my proof, which I want to get verified. Put $c_n = a_n - b_n $ , then $f(x) = \sum c_n x^n =0$ for all $x \in E $ Let $t$ be a limit point of $E$ . Then there is a sequence in $E$ which converges to $t$ , and there exist a subsequence of it which consists of numbers bigger than $t$ or smaller than $t$ . wlog assume there is a increasing sequence $ \{ t_n \} $ which converges to $t$ and $t_n < t$ for all $n$ Then we have $f(t_n )=0$ for all $n$ . Since $f$ is continuous on $(-R, R)$ , we have $f(t)=0$ . (Note that $t \in S$ , so $f(t)$ can be defined.) Also, since $f$ is differentiable on $(-R, R)$ , by mean value theorem, there exists a sequence $s_n $ such that $t_{n} < s_n < t_{n+1} $ and $f'(s_n )=0$ for all $n$ . It is obvious that $s_n$ converges to $t$ , and since $f'$ is continuous on $(-R, R)$ too, so we have $f'(t)=0$ . We can repeat this, (rigorous proof can done by induction) to get $f^{(n)}(t)=0$ for all $n$ . Thus by Theorem 8.4 (which I state at the end of this question), $f(x)=0$ for $x \in ( t-\epsilon , t+\epsilon ) \subset (-R, R) $ , where $\epsilon >0$ is arbitrary. Now we can repeat this stuff to get $f(x) =0$ for all $x \in (-R,R)$ . So $f^{(n)}(0)=0$ for all $n$ , which gives $c_n =0$ for all $n$ . Here is Theorem 8.4, which I used above.

In some sense, the implication should not be there, because while $A_n<0$ does not seem to be crucial for $B_n$, I have found that whenever $A_n>0$ we have $B_n<0$: the former is equivalent to $$a_{n+1}>a_n\frac{b_{n+1}}{b_n}$$ and since for large enough $n$, $0<a_n<1, a_n<b_n<1, 0<b_{n+1}<b_n$ this is stronger than $$a_{n+1}>1-\frac{1-a_n}{1-b_n}(1-b_{n+1}),$$ equivalent to $B_n<0$. $A_n<0$ does not seem to be crucial because it should be possible to have this happen without making $a_{n+1}$ so small that $B_n$ becomes positive.

If $A_n=a_{n+1}b_n-a_nb_{n+1}$ changes sign infinitely often, does it follow that $B_n=(1-a_{n+1})(1-b_n)-(1-a_n)(1-b_{n+1})$ also does? In some sense, the implication should not be there, because while $A_n<0$ does not seem to be crucial for $B_n$, I have found that whenever $A_n>0$ we have $B_n<0$: the former is equivalent to $$a_{n+1}>a_n\frac{b_{n+1}}{b_n}$$ and since for large enough $n$, $0<a_n<1, a_n<b_n<1, 0<b_{n+1}<b_n$ this is stronger than $$a_{n+1}>1-\frac{1-a_n}{1-b_n}(1-b_{n+1}),$$ equivalent to $B_n<0$. $A_n<0$ does not seem to be crucial because it should be possible to have this happen without making $a_{n+1}$ so small that $B_n$ becomes positive.

38,Equivalence of Cauchy integral with Riemann integral,Equivalence of Cauchy integral with Riemann integral,,"There has already been some discussion on this topic . However my question is about a specific solution to this problem and for the benefit of readers I think it is better to add some context (even though it means repetition of some stuff mentioned in the linked question). In what follows $f$ is a function of type $f:[a, b]\to\mathbb{R}$ and $f$ is bounded. A partition $P$ of $[a, b]$ is a set of type $$P = \{x_{0}, x_{1}, x_{2}, \dots, x_{n}\}$$ where $$a = x_{0} < x_{1} < x_{2} < \dots < x_{n} = b$$ The norm $||P||$ of partition $P$ is defined by $||P|| = \max_{i = 1}^{n}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1})$. We define the following sums for $f$ over $P$ \begin{align} C(f, P) &= \sum_{i = 1}^{n}f(x_{i - 1})(x_{i} - x_{i - 1})\notag\\ S(f, P) &= \sum_{i = 1}^{n}f(t_{i})(x_{i} - x_{i - 1})\notag\\ U(f, P) &= \sum_{i = 1}^{n}M_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1})\notag\\ L(f, P) &= \sum_{i = 1}^{n}m_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1})\notag \end{align} where $t_{i}$ are arbitrary points in $[x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]$ and $$M_{i} = \sup\,\{f(x)\mid x\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\},\,m_{i} = \inf\,\{f(x)\mid x\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\}$$ The sum $C(f, P)$ is called (left) Cauchy sum for $f$ over $P$. The Riemann sum $S(f, P)$ depends on choice of tags $t_{i}$ but this dependence in not shown in the notation and should be evident from the context. And finally $U(f, P), L(f, P)$ are upper and lower Darboux sums for $f$ over $P$. Cauchy Integral : The function $f$ is said be said to be Cauchy integrable over $[a, b] $ with Cauchy integral $I$ if for every $\epsilon >0$ there is a number $\delta > 0$ such that $|C(f, P) - I| < \epsilon$ whenever $P$ is a partition of $[a, b]$ with $||P|| < \delta$. A similar definition is available for Riemann integral if $C(f, P)$ is replaced by $S(f, P)$. Both these notions are equivalent and since every Cauchy sum is also a Riemann sum, the inference from Riemann to Cauchy is trivial. The converse appears to be hard and perhaps not popular enough to be seen in textbooks. User Tony Piccolo in his answer gives three references for the proof that Cauchy integrability implies Riemann integrability. It is the second proof from that answer which I want to discuss here (as other two proofs use somewhat complicated ideas and some very non-obvious tricks). This is provided as a hint that Given any partition $P$ of $[a, b]$ and a number $\epsilon > 0$ there is a partition $Q\supseteq P$ of $[a, b]$ such that $C(f, Q) > U(f, P) - \epsilon$. Using the counterpart equation $C(f, P) < L(f, P) + \epsilon$ we can easily show that difference $U(f, P) - L(f, P)$ can be made small if sums $C(f, P)$ tend to a finite limit and thus we get Riemann integrability (via Darboux integrability, also this link between Darboux and Riemann integral is popular and available in good textbooks). Here are my questions: It is easy to prove that we can choose tags $t_{i}$ such that $S(f, P) > U(f, P) - \epsilon$. We just have to choose tags so that $f(t_{i})$ is sufficiently near $M_{i}$. My hunch is that if we add the tags $t_{i}$ to $P$ we get a partition $Q\supseteq P$ and that is the needed partition which ensures $C(f, Q) > U(f, P) - k\epsilon$ where $k$ is some fixed positive constant. Is this correct? And if so how do we go about proving this? Another doubt is whether the relation between $C(f, P)$ and $U(f, P)$ is valid in general?

Here is Theorem 5.12 in the book Principles of Mathematical Analysis by Walter Rudin, 3rd edition: Suppose $f$ is a real differentiable function on $[a, b]$ and suppose $f^\prime(a) < \lambda < f^\prime(b)$. Then there is a point $x \in (a, b)$ such that $f^\prime(x) = \lambda$. A similar result holds of course if $f^\prime(a) > \lambda > f^\prime(b)$. And, here is the Corollary by Rudin to the above theorem. If $f$ is differentiable on $[a, b]$, then $f^\prime$ cannot have any simple discontinuities on $[a, b]$. Finally, here is Definition 4.26 in Baby Rudin, 3rd edition: Let $f$ be defined on $(a, b)$. If $f$ is discontinuous at a point $x$, and if $f(x+)$ and $f(x-)$ exist, then $f$ is said to have a discontinuity of the first kind , or a simple discontinuity , at $x$. Otherwise the discontinuity is said to be of the second kind . There are two ways in which a function can have a simple discontinuity: either $f(x+) \neq f(x-)$ [in which case the value $f(x)$ is immaterial], or $f(x+) = f(x-) \neq f(x)$. I've just found out that this very question has an answer at the following link. Discontinuities of the derivative of a differentiable function on closed interval However, I'm stuck on the following part of the answer. For the the second kind, say $f'(x-)<f'(x+)$ and pick $\lambda\in(f'(x-),f'(x+))$, and let $u<x<v$ with $u$, $v$ sufficiently close to $x$ so that $f'(z)<\lambda$ for $z\in[u,x)$, and $f'(z)>\lambda$ for $z\in(x,v]$. Why can we not have $f^\prime(x) = \lambda$ in this case (and thus fail to get our desired contradiction)? In order to demonstrate my understanding of the answer, I'll rephrase it, or rather expand upon it. Suppose $f$ is a real function which is differentiable on a closed interval $[a, b]$, and suppose $f^\prime$ has a simple discontinuity at a point $p \in [a, b]$. Then as both $f^\prime(p+)$ and $f^\prime(p-)$ exist, so we must have $p \in (a, b)$. Am I right? Now there are two possible cases, according to whether (i) $f^\prime(p-) = f^\prime(p+) \neq f^\prime(p)$ or (ii) $f^\prime(p-) \neq f^\prime(p+)$. Case (i): We can assume without loss of generality that $f^\prime(p-) = f^\prime(p+) < f^\prime(p)$. Let $\lambda$ be a real number such that    $$\lambda \in \left( \ \lim_{x \to p} f^\prime(x), \ f^\prime(p) \ \right);$$   that is,    $$ \lim_{x \to p} f^\prime(x) < \lambda < f^\prime(p).$$   Now let $\varepsilon$ be any real number such that    $$0 < \varepsilon <  \lambda - \lim_{x \to p} f^\prime(x).$$   Then we can find a real number $\delta > 0$ such that    $$ (p-\delta, p+\delta) \subset (a, b), $$   and    $$ \left\vert f^\prime(x) - \lim_{x \to p} f^\prime(x) \right\vert < \varepsilon$$   for all $x \in (p-\delta, p+\delta) \setminus \left\{ p \right\}$;    that is,    $$ \lim_{x \to p} f^\prime(x)  - \varepsilon < f^\prime(x) < \lim_{x \to p} f^\prime(x) + \varepsilon $$   for all $x \in (p-\delta, p+\delta) \setminus \left\{ p \right\}$.

If so, then where do we get our desired contradiction?","This question already has answers here : Discontinuities of the derivative of a differentiable function on closed interval (2 answers) Closed 1 year ago . Here is Theorem 5.12 in the book Principles of Mathematical Analysis by Walter Rudin, 3rd edition: Suppose $f$ is a real differentiable function on $[a, b]$ and suppose $f^\prime(a) < \lambda < f^\prime(b)$. Then there is a point $x \in (a, b)$ such that $f^\prime(x) = \lambda$. A similar result holds of course if $f^\prime(a) > \lambda > f^\prime(b)$. And, here is the Corollary by Rudin to the above theorem. If $f$ is differentiable on $[a, b]$, then $f^\prime$ cannot have any simple discontinuities on $[a, b]$. Finally, here is Definition 4.26 in Baby Rudin, 3rd edition: Let $f$ be defined on $(a, b)$. If $f$ is discontinuous at a point $x$, and if $f(x+)$ and $f(x-)$ exist, then $f$ is said to have a discontinuity of the first kind , or a simple discontinuity , at $x$. Otherwise the discontinuity is said to be of the second kind . There are two ways in which a function can have a simple discontinuity: either $f(x+) \neq f(x-)$ [in which case the value $f(x)$ is immaterial], or $f(x+) = f(x-) \neq f(x)$. I've just found out that this very question has an answer at the following link. Discontinuities of the derivative of a differentiable function on closed interval However, I'm stuck on the following part of the answer. For the the second kind, say $f'(x-)<f'(x+)$ and pick $\lambda\in(f'(x-),f'(x+))$, and let $u<x<v$ with $u$, $v$ sufficiently close to $x$ so that $f'(z)<\lambda$ for $z\in[u,x)$, and $f'(z)>\lambda$ for $z\in(x,v]$. Why can we not have $f^\prime(x) = \lambda$ in this case (and thus fail to get our desired contradiction)? In order to demonstrate my understanding of the answer, I'll rephrase it, or rather expand upon it. Suppose $f$ is a real function which is differentiable on a closed interval $[a, b]$, and suppose $f^\prime$ has a simple discontinuity at a point $p \in [a, b]$. Then as both $f^\prime(p+)$ and $f^\prime(p-)$ exist, so we must have $p \in (a, b)$. Am I right? Now there are two possible cases, according to whether (i) $f^\prime(p-) = f^\prime(p+) \neq f^\prime(p)$ or (ii) $f^\prime(p-) \neq f^\prime(p+)$. Case (i): We can assume without loss of generality that $f^\prime(p-) = f^\prime(p+) < f^\prime(p)$. Let $\lambda$ be a real number such that    $$\lambda \in \left( \ \lim_{x \to p} f^\prime(x), \ f^\prime(p) \ \right);$$   that is,    $$ \lim_{x \to p} f^\prime(x) < \lambda < f^\prime(p).$$   Now let $\varepsilon$ be any real number such that    $$0 < \varepsilon <  \lambda - \lim_{x \to p} f^\prime(x).$$   Then we can find a real number $\delta > 0$ such that    $$ (p-\delta, p+\delta) \subset (a, b), $$   and    $$ \left\vert f^\prime(x) - \lim_{x \to p} f^\prime(x) \right\vert < \varepsilon$$   for all $x \in (p-\delta, p+\delta) \setminus \left\{ p \right\}$;    that is,    $$ \lim_{x \to p} f^\prime(x)  - \varepsilon < f^\prime(x) < \lim_{x \to p} f^\prime(x) + \varepsilon $$   for all $x \in (p-\delta, p+\delta) \setminus \left\{ p \right\}$. But    $$ \lim_{x \to p} f^\prime(x) + \varepsilon < \lambda.$$   So we can conclude that    $$ f^\prime(x) < \lambda \ \mbox{ for all } \ x \in (p-\delta, p+\delta) \setminus \left\{ p \right\}.$$   Let us put    $$y \colon= p - \frac{\delta}{2}, \ \mbox{ and } \ z \colon= p + \frac{\delta}{2}.$$   Then we can conclude that    $$ f^\prime(x) <  \lambda \ \mbox{ for all } \ x \in [y, p). \tag{1} $$   Thus in particular,    $$f^\prime(y) < \lambda.$$ But we have assumed that    $$\lambda < f^\prime(p). $$    So we must have a point $x \in (y, p)$ for which $f^\prime(x) = \lambda$, which contradicts (1) above.

(1) would be accomplished as follows. Let $E=\bigcap_k\bigcup_n F^k_n$, $F^k_n$ closed.

This way we obtain $\bigcup_n G^k_n=\bigcap_{l\le k}\bigcup_n F^l_n$. Finally, put $E^k_n=\bigcup_{m\le n}G^k_m$.

I am asking if the converse is true, i.e., whether for every $F_{\sigma\delta}$-set $E\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ there exists a sequence $\langle f_n:n\in\mathbb{N}\rangle$ of continuous functions, $f_n\colon\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$, such that $\big\{x\in\mathbb{R}:\lim_{n\to\infty}f_n(x)\text{ exists}\big\}=E$. My attempt : I would try to prove it in two steps. (1) Given an $F_{\sigma\delta}$-set $E$, find closed sets $E^k_n$, $n,k\in\mathbb{N}$, such that $E^k_n\supseteq E^l_n$ and $E^k_n\subseteq E^k_m$ for $k\le l$ and $n\le m$, and $E=\bigcap_k\bigcup_n E^k_n$. (2) Given $E^k_n$ as above, find continuous functions $f_n\colon\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ such that for every $x$, $x\in E^k_N$ iff $\left|f_n(x)-f_m(x)\right|\le 2^{-k}$ for all $m\ge n\ge N$. (1) would be accomplished as follows. Let $E=\bigcap_k\bigcup_n F^k_n$, $F^k_n$ closed. Let $\langle G^0_n:n\in\mathbb{N}\rangle$ consists of all elements of $\langle F^0_n:n\in\mathbb{N}\rangle$, each repeating infinitely many times. Let $\langle G^1_n:n\in\mathbb{N}\rangle$ consists of all possible intersections $F^0_i\cap F^1_j$, $i,j\in\mathbb{N}$, each repeating infinitely many times and ordered so that $G^1_n\subseteq G^0_n$ for every $n$. Similarly, let $\langle G^k_n:n\in\mathbb{N}\rangle$ consists of all possible intersections $G^0_{i_0}\cap\cdots\cap G^k_{i_k}$, $i_0\dots,i_k\in\mathbb{N}$, each repeating infinitely many times and ordered so that $G^k_n\subseteq G^l_n$ for every $n$, whenever $l<k$. This way we obtain $\bigcup_n G^k_n=\bigcap_{l\le k}\bigcup_n F^l_n$. Finally, put $E^k_n=\bigcup_{m\le n}G^k_m$. Then $\bigcup_n E^k_n=\bigcup_n G^k_n$ and hence $\bigcap_k\bigcup_n E^k_n=\bigcap_k\bigcup_n G^k_n=\bigcap_k\bigcup_n F^k_n=E$. Is that correct?

(Such functions $g$ are called continuous extensions of $f$ from $E$ to $\mathbb{R}^1$ .) Show that the result becomes false if the word ""closed"" is omitted. Extend the result to vector-valued functions. Hint: Let the graph of $g$ be a straight line on each of the segments which constitute the complement of $E$ (compare Exercise 29, Chap. 2). The result remains true if $\mathbb{R}^1$ is replaced by any metric space, but the proof is not so simple. First of all, we show that the word ""closed"" is essential. Let $E = (-\infty, 0) \cup (0, +\infty)$ , and let $f \colon  E \to \mathbb{R}^1$ be defined as $$ f(x) = \frac{1}{x} \ \mbox{ for all } x \in E.$$ Then the set $E$ is not closed in $\mathbb{R}^1$ , but there is no continuous function $g \colon \mathbb{R}^1 \to \mathbb{R}^1$ such that $g(x) = f(x)$ for all $x \in E$ , although $f$ is certainly continuous. Am I right? Now we show the main result: First of all, here is Exercise 29, Chap. 2 in Baby Rudin, 3rd edition: Prove that every open set in $\mathbb{R}^1$ is the union of an at most countable collection of disjoint segments. ... Since $\mathbb{R}^1 - E$ is open in $\mathbb{R}^1$ , it is the union of an at most countable collection of disjoint segments $\left\{ \left(a_n, b_n \right) \right\}_{n \in K}$ , where $K$ is either the set $J = \left\{ 1, 2, 3, \ldots \right\}$ or $K$ is some $J_N = \left\{ 1, \ldots, N \right\}$ for some $N \in \mathbb{N}$ ; moreover, $\left( a_m, b_m \right) \cap \left( a_n, b_n \right) = \emptyset$ for any two distinct $m, n \in K$ ; finally some $\left( a_n, b_n \right)$ can possibly be infinite. Now since $$\mathbb{R}^1 - E = \cup_{n \in K} \left( a_n, b_n \right),$$ each of the (finite) endpoints of these segments is an element of set $E$ . Now if some segment $\left( a_n, b_n \right)$ has $-\infty$ as its left endpoint, then we put $g(x) = f \left( b_n \right)$ for all $x \in \left( a_n, b_n \right)$ . If some segment $\left(a_m, b_m \right)$ has $+\infty$ as its right endpoint, then we put $g(x) = f\left( a_m \right)$ for all $x \in \left( a_m, b_m \right)$ . And, for any segment $\left( a_n, b_n \right)$ , where $-\infty < a_n < b_n < +\infty$ , we put $$ g(x) = f\left( a_n \right) + \left[ \frac{ f\left( b_n \right) - f\left( a_n \right)}{b_n - a_n} \right] \left( x - a_n \right) $$ for all $x \in \left( a_n, b_n \right)$ . I hope I've used the hint given by Rudin correctly. If so, then how to rigorously show that the resulting real function $g$ defined on $\mathbb{R}^1$ is continuous on all of $\mathbb{R}^1$ ? This is intuitively clear though, but how does the countability of these segments become significant? Up to this point, Rudin hasn't stated any result about the continuity of a function defined using several continuous functions as pieces, like our function $g$ is defined here. Moreover, are there any other possibilities for $g$ besides the one we have defined above? Now we state the generalization of the above result for vector-valued functions. Let $E$ be a closed set in $\mathbb{R}^1$ , and let $\mathbf{f}$ be a continuous function defined on $E$ with values in some $\mathbb{R}^k$ . Then there are continuous functions $\mathbf{g}$ defined on $\mathbb{R}^1$ with values in the same $\mathbb{R}^k$ such that $\mathbf{g}(x) = \mathbb{f}(x)$ for all $x \in E$ . In order to prove this generalized result, let's put $\mathbb{f}(x) = \left( f_1(x), \ldots, f_k(x) \right)$ for all $x \in E$ , where $f_1, \ldots, f_k$ are real continuous functions defined on $E$ , and each of these functions we can continuously extend to all of $\mathbb{R}^1$ , thereby getting a continuous extension $\mathbf{g}$ of $\mathbf{f}$ from $E$ to all of $\mathbb{R}^1$ . Is this reasoning correct? Last but not the least, I have the following query. Let $\left( X, d_X \right)$ and $\left( Y, d_Y \right)$ be metric spaces, let $E \subset X$ such that $E$ is closed in $\left( X, d_X \right)$ , and let $f$ be a continuous mapping of the induced metric space $E$ into the metric space $Y$ . Then can we find---or prove the existence of---a continuous mapping $g$ of $X$ into $Y$ such that $g(x) = f(x)$ for all $x \in E$ ? If so, then how to find such a map or prove it exists?

Show that  $$xy \leq \frac{x^p}{p} + \frac{y^q}{q} $$    [Suggestion: Without loss of generality suppose $xy = 1$]. Attempt: Let $f, \varphi : U \to \mathbb R$, $U = \{(x,y) \in \mathbb R^2; x > 0 , y > 0 \}$ given by $f(x,y) = \frac{x^p}{p} + \frac{y^q}{q}$ and $\varphi (x,y) = xy$.

Consider $M = \varphi^{-1} (1)$, the hyperbola $xy =1$.

We define the family $\mathcal{F}$ so that $\phi \in \mathcal{F}$ sss $\phi$ is measurable ($Y$ with borel sigma algebra) for all $x\in M$, $\ $  $\phi(x,.): Y \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is continuous i.e. $\phi(x,.)\in (C^0(Y),\Vert . \Vert_0  )$ (supremum norm) $x \mapsto \Vert \phi(x,.) \Vert_0 \in L^1(\mu)$ equip $\mathcal{F}$ of a norm:   $\Vert \phi \Vert_1=\int \Vert \phi(x,.) \Vert_0 d\mu$ Then $(\mathcal{F}, \Vert . \Vert_1 )$ is a separable Banach space. I tried that $(\mathcal{F}, \Vert . \Vert_1 )$ is a Banach space I have difficulty with the separability: I show my progress using the fact that $C^0(Y)$ is separable, and the assumption that the probability space is separable we obtain: $\lbrace f_i\rbrace $ countable and dense in $C^0(Y)$ and $\Gamma= \lbrace \sum _{k=1}^{r}  c_k\chi_{A_k} : A_k \in E, c_k\in \mathbb{Q} \rbrace $ countable and dense in $L^1(\mu)$. Now note that for $\phi \in \mathcal{F}$, $\phi(x,.)$ can be approximated by $\lbrace f_i\rbrace $ and  $\phi(.,y) \in L^1(\mu)$ since for fixed $y$ $$\int \vert\phi(x,y)\vert d\mu(x)\leq \Vert \phi\Vert_1$$ then $\phi(.,y)$ can be approximated by $\Gamma$ but how to unite these facts...

I know that the condition on the interpolation nodes $t_1,\ldots,t_m$ should look something like the ones appearing below 1) $min_{k,\ell}|t_k-t_\ell|\ge 1/n$ (with the distance meant to be circular that is |0.9-0.1|=0.2). or 2) more sophisticated conditions like: $D_{m}(t_1,\ldots,t_m)$ needs to be small. The discrepancy of a a finite sequence of real numbers $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_N\in[0,1]$ is defined as  \begin{equation*} D_N(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_N)=\underset{0\le\alpha<\beta\le 1}{sup}\bigg|\frac{A([\alpha,\beta);N)}{N}-(\beta-\alpha)\bigg|, \end{equation*} with $A([\alpha,\beta);N)$ denoting the number of $x_i$ such that $x_i\in[\alpha,\beta)$ (Based on section 2 of Uniform Distribution of Sequences by Kuipers and Niederreiter).",,"['real-analysis', 'complex-analysis', 'trigonometry', 'fourier-analysis', 'harmonic-analysis']"
