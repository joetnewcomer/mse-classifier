Here's a diagram I made of the problem below. I've come as far as setting up the equation, but I cannot see a way to go about solving it.  If I traced a line from the center of the circle to the top right corner of the square, I have a right triangle.  I can use trigonometry to find the side lengths of such a triangle. $$ x = \cos \theta \\ y = \sin \theta $$ I can deduce that the side length $s$ of the square is equal to twice the height of this triangle and also equal to the difference between the base of this triangle and half the side length of the previous square. $$ s = \cos \theta - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \\ s = 2 \sin \theta $$ By setting these two equations equal to each other, I can attempt to solve for $\theta$, thereby allowing me to solve for the side length of the square. $$ \cos \theta - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 2 \sin \theta $$ After reaching this point, I am not sure how to continue.  I can immediately see that I cannot solve for $\theta$ easily by just rearranging the equation.  I've thought about substituting $\cos \frac{\pi}{4}$ back in for $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ to make use of some obscure trigonometric identity, but nothing I've tried gets me anywhere near solving the equation.  Any hints or solutions would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you for taking the time to look at this.",,"['geometry', 'trigonometry']"

91,Solving For Sin Using Pi,Solving For Sin Using Pi,,"Solving for sin using pi I was messing around with calculating pi by finding the perimeter of a many sided polygon, and dividing it by the diameter (Like the thing Archimedes did). The equation I found was n(sin(180/n))=pi , where n is the number of sides the polygon has. I was wondering if there was any way to reverse this equation, making it so that you can solve for sine using pi. Here is what I tried: (Note: This is all in degrees because I do not know radians that well) This is what I started with n(sin(180/n))=pi Divide both sides by n (sin(180/n))=pi/n Substitute a for 180/n to get (sin(a))=pi/n . This means 180/n=a Then I multiplied both sides of that by n to get 180=a*n And divided both sides by a to get 180/a=n Now I have solved that equation for n , so I can substitute it back into my original equation for n to get (sin(a))=pi/(180/a) , which can be simplified to sin(a)=pi*a/180 . What this says is that the sin(a) is equal to pi*a/180 , which definitely isn't true. One interesting thing about this equation is that it is the equation to convert degrees into radians. Also, if you graph it, you will is very close to the sin wave until about 25. (If you graph this equation, make sure you are using degrees and not radians) After trying this out, I did some reasearch and found there is no easy way to calculate sine. However, I would still like to know what was wrong with the math I did to simplify this. Thanks. I am 13 and this is my first question I have posted, so please excuse any mistakes.","Solving for sin using pi I was messing around with calculating pi by finding the perimeter of a many sided polygon, and dividing it by the diameter (Like the thing Archimedes did).
