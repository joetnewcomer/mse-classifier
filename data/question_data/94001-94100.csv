23,How to do calculus with split-complex (hyperbolic) numbers?,How to do calculus with split-complex (hyperbolic) numbers?,,"TL;DR: how do I define a ""split-holomorphic"" function? As far as I've heard, there is a notion of split-complex numbers: $z = x+uy$ , with $u\not\in \Bbb R $ and $u^2 = 1$ . One defines the conjugate as $\overline{z} = x - uy$ and the modulus as $|z| = \sqrt{|z\overline{z}|}$ , where the absolute value inside the root is the one for real numbers, as usual. Apparently this can be used to study the pseudo-Riemannian geometry of $\Bbb L^2 = \Bbb R^2_1$ in the same way thay $\Bbb C$ is identified with $\Bbb R^2$ . But these split-complex numbers form a ring only, and not a field: elements in the diagonals don't have multiplicative inverses. Incidentally, these diagonals correspond to lightlike directions in $\Bbb L^2$ (and such directions cause every sort of problems). I don't know if there is a standard notation for this set of split-complex numbers, but given a function of said set to itself, how do I define things like ""being holomorphic""? I can't make sense of the limit $$\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(z_0+h)-f(z_0)}{h}$$ since $h$ could approach zero from lightlike directions. Do I just ignore these directions? Most likely I'm overthinking this. We could define continuity of $f$ by continuity of its components, and work formally with the above limit to obtain a revised version of the CR equations, and say that $f$ is split-holomorphic if the revised CR equations hold and if the partial derivatives of the components are continuous (copying the Looman-Menchoff theorem), but I am speculating too much and I am unsure about these things. What is the correct way to do calculus with split-complex numbers, if this is possible? More references are also welcome. P.s.: there is a nice book called ""Geometry of Minkowski Space-Time"", by Zampetti, et al, but they do a more algebraic approach and do not talk about the things I'm asking.","TL;DR: how do I define a ""split-holomorphic"" function?

But these split-complex numbers form a ring only, and not a field: elements in the diagonals don't have multiplicative inverses. Incidentally, these diagonals correspond to lightlike directions in (and such directions cause every sort of problems). I don't know if there is a standard notation for this set of split-complex numbers, but given a function of said set to itself, how do I define things like ""being holomorphic""? I can't make sense of the limit since could approach zero from lightlike directions. Do I just ignore these directions? Most likely I'm overthinking this. We could define continuity of by continuity of its components, and work formally with the above limit to obtain a revised version of the CR equations, and say that is split-holomorphic if the revised CR equations hold and if the partial derivatives of the components are continuous (copying the Looman-Menchoff theorem), but I am speculating too much and I am unsure about these things. What is the correct way to do calculus with split-complex numbers, if this is possible? More references are also welcome.

In another words, we have  $$ \sup_{r>0}|f(re^{i\theta})|\leq M_1^{1-\frac{\theta}{\gamma}}\times M_2^{\frac{\theta}{\gamma}}. $$ I want to know if the assumptions of the lemma are sharp. For example, if we change the second condition to the following $$ |f(re^{i\gamma})|\leq M_2(1+r)^{a}, $$ for some $a>0$ (now $f$ has polynomial growth ), and $f$ is still bounded on the positive real line, and satisfy the same mild growth condition on the interior, then can we also obtain the same conclusion? If not, is there any counterexample to this? Thanks very much for any comment.",,"['complex-analysis', 'analysis', 'interpolation']"

So $$\operatorname*{Res}_{z=2i}\left ( \frac{1/(z+2i)^2}{(z-2i)^2} \right )=\lim_{z\to2i}\left ( \frac{\mathrm{d} }{\mathrm{d} z} \left ( (z-2i)^2*\frac{1/(z+2i)^2}{(z-2i)^2} \right )\right )$$ $$=\lim_{z\to2i}\left ( \frac{\mathrm{d} }{\mathrm{d} z} \left ( \frac{1}{(z+2i)^2} \right )\right )$$ $$=\lim_{z\to 2i}\left ( -\frac{2}{(z+2i)^3} \right )$$ $$=-\frac{2}{(4i)^3}$$ Similarly, $$\operatorname*{Res}_{z=-2i}\left ( \frac{p_2(z)}{q_2(z)} \right )=\operatorname*{Res}_{z=-2i}\left ( \frac{1/(z-2i)^2}{(z+2i)^2} \right )=\lim_{z\to-2i}\left ( \frac{\mathrm{d} }{\mathrm{d} z} \left ( (z+2i)^2*\frac{1/(z-2i)^2}{(z+2i)^2} \right )\right )$$ $$=\lim_{z\to-2i}\left ( \frac{\mathrm{d} }{\mathrm{d} z} \left ( \frac{1}{(z-2i)^2} \right )\right )$$ $$=\lim_{z\to -2i}\left ( -\frac{2}{(z-2i)^3} \right )$$ $$=-\frac{2}{(-4i)^3}$$ So finally, $$\int_{-R}^{R}\frac{dx}{(x^2+4)^2} + \int_{C_R}\frac{dz}{(z^2+4)^2}=2 \pi i \left ( -\frac{2}{(4i)^3}-\frac{2}{(-4i)^3} \right )=0$$ So, $$\int_{-R}^{R}\frac{dx}{(x^2+4)^2} =0- \int_{C_R}\frac{dz}{(z^2+4)^2}$$ $$=-\left ( \int_{C_1}\frac{1/(z+2i)^2}{(z-2i)^2}dz+\int_{C_2}\frac{1/(z-2i)^2}{(z+2i)^2}dz \right )$$ where $C_1$ contains the point $z=2i$ and $C_2$ contains the point $z=-2i$. $$=-\left (2\pi i\left ( \frac{1}{(2i+2i)^2} \right )+2\pi i\left ( \frac{1}{(-2i-2i)^2} \right )  \right )$$ $$=-\frac{2\pi i}{(4i)^2}-\frac{2\pi i}{(-4i)^2}$$ $$=\frac{\pi i}{4}$$ The final answer should be $\frac{\pi}{16}$, however, which I cannot seem to get.

I was going to evaluate the integral of the function  $$ f(z) = \frac{e^{iz \alpha} }{(z^2+b^2)^2}$$ around this contour. However, since there is a singularity at $ib$ , a point contained within the contour, I had to use the residue theorem to calculate the integral around the entire region. I thought this would be an easy task, but it actually proved to be a hold up, as using the limit technique of evaluating poles of order 2 lead me to a limit which I could not figure out how to compute. To summarize my intent was to take the integral of $f(z)$ around the two pieces of the contour, show that the top part goes to 0, and then note that the integral around the bottom line segment is twice as much as the desired integral, since the function of the desired integral is even. Then we have that the desired integral is one-half of the residue value. However I got stuck on calculating the residue using the limit definition, and could not find a Laurent expansion of my function. Edit: Just to clarify, the contour I am describing can be parametrized as $$\phi_1(t) = t ,-R\leq t\leq R \text{ and }\phi_2(t) = Re^{it},  0\leq t\leq\pi.$$",,['complex-analysis']

Prove that $f(z) = 0$ for all $z \in \Bbb{C}$ . Here is my solution which I am hoping someone could check: First, it easily follows from the hypothesis that $f(0)= 0$ , so if we could prove $f$ is constant, then it would automatically follow that $f=0$ on $\Bbb{C}$ . Indeed, $$|f(0)| \le 2 \ln (|0|+1) = 2 \ln (1) = 0.$$ Now, let us prove that $f$ is constant. Let $z_0 \in \Bbb{C}$ and $r > 0$ arbitrary. Then, because $f$ is entire, we know it is holomorphic on a neighborhood of $\overline{B(z_0,r)}$ , so Cauchy estimates tell us that $$|f'(z_0)| \le \frac{\sup_{|z-z_0|=r} |f(z)|}{r} \le 2 \frac{\sup_{|z-z_0|=r} \ln (|z|+1)}{r}.$$ Let $z$ be any complex number satisfying $|z-z_0| = r$ . Then there exists a unit complex number $w_z$ such that $z = rw_z + z_0$ . Since $x \mapsto \ln x$ is an increasing function on $(0,\infty)$ , we have $$\ln(|z| + 1) = \ln(|rw_z + z_0| + 1) \le \ln (|rw_{z}| + |z_0| + 1) = \ln (r + z_0 + 1)$$ and hence, $$|f'(z_0)| \le 2 \frac{\ln (r + z_0 + 1)}{r}.$$ As $r \to \infty$ , the numerator and denominator of the fraction on the RHS go to $\infty$ . But L'Hôpital's rule says $$|f'(z_0)| \le 2 \lim_{r \to \infty} \frac{\ln (r + z_0 + 1)}{r} = 2 \lim_{r \to \infty} \frac{1}{r + |z_0| + 1} = 0,$$ so $f'(z_0)=0$ .
