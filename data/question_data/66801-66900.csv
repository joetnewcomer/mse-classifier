15,Colouring 9 vertices on a circle.,Colouring 9 vertices on a circle.,,"Today I've got a combinatorics problem that I've been trying to solve and I think I have found a good algorithm to get. The problem is the following Suppose that there are 9 points in a circle. Tagged from 1 to 9. We want to color theses points with the colours Green, Red and Orange respectively in the following way: There must be 3 points coloured with the same color for each of the colours. (No matter their position) Any two consecutive points will have a different colour. So my thoughts are as follows: Construct a circle with 9 vertices on it $ v_{1}, v_{2}, \cdots, v_{9}$ . The vertices will represent any of the points. To get the desire configurations consider the following. We will meet any two vertices of the same color with an edge so that a triangle can be constructed of the 3 necessary vertices having the same color for each colour respectively. Now, How many configurations of triangles are there such that the given conditions hold? In this case we can and first of all, we can choose a vertex in 9 ways. Notice, we cannot color the two adjacent vertices aside that chosen vertex (in the second image if we choose vertex 1 and it is red, we cannot color $v_{2}$ neither $v_{9}$ red. Then there are 6 possible choices for the second vertex, once I've chosen this second vertex, I can't choose the two vertices adjacent to it, then I'll have another 4 options for the second vertex, and for the third for the same reasoning I'll have just 2 options. For making the first triangle configuration, there are $ 9( 6\cdot 4 \cdot 2) $ . For the second colored triangle, there are 6 remaining vertices, and by the same process made in the first there are thus $ 6( 4 \cdot 2 \cdot 1)$ triangles. The third triangle is fixed due to the selection of the last 2. Then by the addition principle the number of triangles is $ 6( 4 \cdot 2 \cdot 1) + 9( 6\cdot 4 \cdot 2) = 264 $ . Here I have a question, look that you can choose the color of  that first chosen vertex in 3 ways. Should I multiply by 3 all the results I've just done or am I be overcounting? Or am I wrong in something above? Any corrections are welcome, and this is not homework.","Today I've got a combinatorics problem that I've been trying to solve and I think I have found a good algorithm to get.

We want to color theses points with the colours Green, Red and Orange respectively in the following way: There must be 3 points coloured with the same color for each of the colours. (No matter their position) Any two consecutive points will have a different colour. So my thoughts are as follows: Construct a circle with 9 vertices on it . The vertices will represent any of the points. To get the desire configurations consider the following. We will meet any two vertices of the same color with an edge so that a triangle can be constructed of the 3 necessary vertices having the same color for each colour respectively. Now, How many configurations of triangles are there such that the given conditions hold? In this case we can and first of all, we can choose a vertex in 9 ways. Notice, we cannot color the two adjacent vertices aside that chosen vertex (in the second image if we choose vertex 1 and it is red, we cannot color neither red. Then there are 6 possible choices for the second vertex, once I've chosen this second vertex, I can't choose the two vertices adjacent to it, then I'll have another 4 options for the second vertex, and for the third for the same reasoning I'll have just 2 options. For making the first triangle configuration, there are . For the second colored triangle, there are 6 remaining vertices, and by the same process made in the first there are thus triangles. The third triangle is fixed due to the selection of the last 2. Then by the addition principle the number of triangles is . Here I have a question, look that you can choose the color of  that first chosen vertex in 3 ways. Should I multiply by 3 all the results I've just done or am I be overcounting? Or am I wrong in something above? Any corrections are welcome, and this is not homework."," v_{1}, v_{2}, \cdots, v_{9} v_{2} v_{9}  9( 6\cdot 4 \cdot 2)   6( 4 \cdot 2 \cdot 1)  6( 4 \cdot 2 \cdot 1) + 9( 6\cdot 4 \cdot 2) = 264 ","['combinatorics', 'contest-math', 'circles', 'coloring']"

Problem: what is In general, if we have n sets with and for every , is there a way to find , or, to find an upper bound or lower bound for it? Background: I am trying to prove that every group with 180 elements is not simple. By Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow-5 subgroups of a simple group with 180 elements can only be 6 or 36.If it contains exactly 6 Sylow-5 subgroups, then it can be embedding into , which is impossible. Hence I tried to prove that it can not contain 36 Sylow-5 subgroups. I tried to make a contradiction by counting the number of elements. If it contains 36 Sylow-5 subgroups, it must contain 144 elements with order 5. And it turns out that such a group can only contain exactly 10 Sylow-3 subgroups.

First, a remark is that, since the product of posets is a binary operation, the elements of $(\{-, 0,+\}^d, \preceq)$ technically have a lot of extra parentheses, which could be omitted without losing any important information. So, for example, instead of $((0,+),-)$ , we’d simply have $(0,+,-)$ . Let $F \in \Phi([-1,1]^d)$ denote a face of the cube, and in particular let $v$ denotes a vertex. Then the mapping I’m thinking of is defined as: \begin{align} &\phi:(\Phi([-1,1]^d)\setminus\{\emptyset\},\subseteq)\to(\{-, 0,+\}^d,\preceq) \\ &\phi(F) = (\text{sgn}(\sum_{v_i \in F}v_{i1}),…,\text{sgn}(\sum_{v_i \in F}v_{id})) \end{align} i.e. we look at the vertices contained in $F$ , summing up their entries component-wise, and then taking their signs. Now I want to show that this map is injective. Given two faces $F_1$ and $F_2$ such that $\phi(F_1) = \phi(F_2)$ , it’s sufficient to show that a vertex $v_i = (v_{i1},…,v_{id})$ in $F_1$ is also in $F_2$ (and vice versa). Consider an entry $j$ in $\phi(F_1) = \phi(F_2) \in \{-, 0,+\}^d$ . If $F_1$ and $F_2$ contain just one vertex, then this entry determines exactly the sum at position $j$ of the vertices in $F_1$ and $F_2$ , respectively (namely, the “sum” of just one summand, resulting in value $-1$ or $1$ ). If $F_1$ and $F_2$ both contain $2^m$ vertices, then we can continue in an inductive fashion to show that the summands that result in the $j$ entry of $\phi(F_1)$ and $\phi(F_2)$ match each other one by one: in summing the $m$ entries in the $j$ -th position of vertices in $F_1$ and those in $F_2$ , assuming that the partial sums up to a certain position $n < m$ match, then the $j$ entry of $\phi(F_1)$ and $\phi(F_2)$ determines what the value of the next summands must be. Of course, this only works if $F_1$ and $F_2$ have the same number of vertices. I got stuck here since I can’t show that given $\phi(F_1) = \phi(F_2)$ , it cannot be the case that $F_1$ contains $m$ vertices, and $F_2$ contains $m’$ vertices, where $m \neq m’$ .

I want to show $\alpha(G) \leq 2$ implies G contains $K_{\left \lceil \frac{n}{3} \right \rceil}$ as a minor. This is what I have so far: If $\alpha(G) = 1$ , the graph $G$ is complete and it must contain the desired minor. So we assume $\alpha(G) = 2$ , thus for any choice of three vertices in $G$ , there must be at least one edge between the three. Thus, the compliment of $G$ , denoted $G^c$ , cannot contain $K_3$ as a subgraph. Notice that if there exists some vertex $v$ in $G^c$ with $\deg(v) = t$ , then if we look at the neighbours of $v$ , there cannot be any edges between the neighbours, (by the fact that no $K_3$ subgraph in $G^c$ ), so we have an independent set of size $t$ in $G^c$ . Equivalently, we have a $K_t$ subgraph in $G$ . So it suffices to show that $G^c$ contains some vertex $v$ with $\deg(v) \geq {\left\lceil \frac{n}{3} \right \rceil}$ or equivalently, that $G$ contains some vertex $v$ with $\deg(v) \leq n - {\left\lceil \frac{n}{3} \right \rceil} = {\left \lfloor \frac{2n}{3} \right \rfloor}$ Suppose it did not contain such a vertex, then for all vertices $v$ in $G$ , we have that: $\deg{v} \geq {\left\lceil \frac{2n}{3} \right \rceil}$ I know that, from here, I can look at a vertex in G and it's $ {\left\lceil \frac{2n}{3} \right \rceil}$ neighbours, and use the fact that the largest independent set is 2 to show that there are many edges between the neighbours of v.

Any insertion of $U^\dagger$ must be preceded by either the letter $V$ or $U^\dagger$ , with an accompanying $U$ for every $U^\dagger$ . Therefore $U$ and $U^\dagger$ come in a pair, and the letter $U$ will always precede the letter $U^\dagger$ in the word they are present in, and there may be multiple letters of $V$ in between them. Furthermore there can be as many pairs of $UU^\dagger$ as the length of the word permits. Hence, the only possible 2 letter words that can be constructed are $VV$ and $UU^\dagger$ .

Two triangles are connected if they have one common vertex and two sides lie on one straight line. Question How many different ways to connect two triangles exist? Edit. My answer is 54 . Let $A$ , $B$ , $C$ and $A_1$ , $B_1$ , $C_1$ be the vertex name of triangles $\Delta ABC$ and $\Delta A_1B_1C_1$ respectively. One can fix the first triangle $\Delta ABC$ and connect vertices $A$ and $A_1$ such that sides $AC$ and $A_1C_1$ will lie on one straight line.  One put the second triangle in three ways: a) outside, b) inside, c) near: In three cases above one can rotate $3$ times the second triangle $\Delta A_1B_1C_1$ while the vertex $A$ is fixed. The triangle $\Delta ABC$ has the two vertices on each side, therefore, one can connect two triangles on one side by $3 \times 2$ ways. The fixed triangle has three sides, therefore, one can connect two triangles by $3 \times 2 \times 3 =18$ ways. One can have three cases above, finally, $18 \times 3 =54$ ways. Edit 2.
