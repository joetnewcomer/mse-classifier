0,Is continuous map from covering space to itself homeomorphism assumed both cover and base path-connected and $pf=p$?,Is continuous map from covering space to itself homeomorphism assumed both cover and base path-connected and ?,pf=p,"In my topology assignment I came across the following problem: True or false? Let $E$ and $X$ be path-connected. For every covering map $p:E\rightarrow X$ and continuous map $f:E\rightarrow E$ such that $pf=p$ holds $f$ is homeomorphism. I couldn't think of any counterexample, so my guess is that assertion is true. Since $X$ is not locally path-connected, I cannot apply lifting theorem to obtain $f$ and its inverse, so I guess I should manually prove properties of homeomorphism on $f$ , using path lifting theorem several times. Recently I had to deal with the operation of a fundamental group operation on a set $p^{-1}(x)$ for $x\in X$ such that $p^{-1}(x)\times \pi_1(X,x)\rightarrow \pi_1(X, x): [w]\cdot e=w(1)$ , that is each point in $E$ maps to the endpoint of a unique lift of the path $w$ (similar to the one in Hatcher). I played around a little trying to prove injection / surjection property of $f$ , but didn't got far. The only thing I proved is that $f([w]\cdot e) = [w]\cdot f(e)$ but nothing more. So I ask what would be an adequate approach to solve this question. Thanks in advance!","In my topology assignment I came across the following problem: True or false? Let and be path-connected.

6,Mistake in Dugundji chapter IX section 11 example 3?,Mistake in Dugundji chapter IX section 11 example 3?,,"A family of pseudometrics defined on a set gives rise to a uniform structure on that set.

There ought to be a way to characterize the uniform continuity of maps $X$ to $Y$ directly in terms of $A$ and $B$ and I thought I knew the correct way to do this but, when I scanned through the relevant sections in Dugundji's Topology to confirm my suspicions, I came across: ""$f: X \to Y$ is uniformly continuous if for each $\beta \in B$ and each $\epsilon > 0$, there exists an $\alpha \in A$ and a $\delta > 0$ such that if $\alpha(x,x') < \delta$, then $\beta(f(x),f(x')) < \epsilon$.""

We say $X$ is locally compact if every member of $X$ has neighborhood basis of compact sets. weak Hausdorff if for every continuous map $f\colon Z\to X$ , where $Z$ is compact Hausdorff, $f(Z)$ is closed in $X$ . Question. ( $Q$ ) Must a locally compact weak Hausdorff space be Hausdorff? Additional background. This question has an equivalent formulation in terms of compactly generated spaces, or "" $k$ -spaces"".  We need a few more definitions.

(Often the above is simply called "" $k$ -closed"", but there are several competing definitions for that term, one of which we are about to introduce here, so we borrow the terminology from this answer for precision.) A subset $A\subseteq X$ is $k_3$ -closed (resp. $k_3$ -open ) if its intersection $A\cap K$ with every compact Hausdorff subset $K\subseteq X$ is closed (resp. open) in $K$ .

The last definition really isn't especially interesting for $n=3$ in light of the answers here. Also there is a definition for $k_1$ as well; it won't be relevant for us, but see the preceding links. Equivalent and related questions. As discussed in the first link above, under either $CG_n$ assumption, the weak Hausdorff condition is equivalent to the otherwise stronger condition $KC$ (Compact subsets are closed).  However, the $KC$ condition in turn immediately upgrades to $T_2$ in the presence of local compactness, as we obtain a basis of closed neighborhoods at each point, which combines with $T_1$ to yield $T_2$ .  (We get $T_1$ from the weak Hausdorff condition, as every singleton is the image of a compact Hausdorff space, hence closed.) Conversely, any locally compact Hausdorff space is easily seen to be $CG_n$ for either $n$ . As a result, the following question, for either $n=2$ or $3$ , is equivalent to ( $Q$ ). ( $Q_n$ ) Must a locally compact weak Hausdorff space be $CG_n$ ? Finally, we note that in general, weak Hausdorff implies $k_2$ -Hausdorff, and under either $CG_n$ assumption, the two are equivalent. Therefore, we could also ask ( $Q'$ ) Must a locally compact $k_2$ -Hausdorff space be Hausdorff? ( $Q_n'$ ) Must a locally compact $k_2$ -Hausdorff space be $CG_n$ ? An affirmative answer to either of these equivalent (to each other) questions implies an affirmative answer to the other questions. In general, a big part of what motivated this question was my desire to find more examples of spaces that are $k_2$ -Hausdorff or even weak-Hausdorff, yet fail to be $KC$ .  As explained above, in the locally compact case any non-Hausdorff example will also fail $KC$ , leading me to this line of inquiry. Addendum. Regarding ( $Q_n$ ), I had difficulty finding any example at all of a locally compact space that failed to be a $CG_2$ -space. $\pi$ -base turned up nothing , though this answer did give a nice non- $T_1$ example.

12,(Short proof verification) Problem related to distance to a set,(Short proof verification) Problem related to distance to a set,,"I have this previous result: Let $(E, d)$ be a metric space and $K\subset E$ a compact subset. Then, for all $x\in E$ there is a $k_x \in K$ such that $d(x, K)=d(x, k_x)$ , where $d(x, K)=\inf\{d(x, k):k\in K\}$ The problem is to show that in case $E=\mathbb{R}^n$ with the usual distance, the previous statement holds for $C \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ (a closed not empty subset) instead of a compact one. My proof is as follows: Let $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ . Take $c_0 \in C$ . Now set $r=d(x, c_0)$ , and consider $W=C \cap \bar{B}(x, r)$ (that is the closed ball of center $x$ and radius $r$ ).  Because $W$ is the intersection of two closed sets, it is closed. It is also bounded, because it is contained in a ball. In $\mathbb{R}^n$ a closed and bounded subset is compact, so apply the previous result to get $k_x \in W$ such that $d(x, k_x)=d(x, W)$ .

A good open cover of a space $X$ is an open cover $(U_i)_i$ , where every finite intersection $U_{i_1} \cap ... \cap U_{i_k}$ is either empty or contractible. I define a sufficient open cover to be a cover, where every finite intersection is either empty or a disjoint union of contractible spaces. Does every topological $n$ -manifold admit a good open cover or a sufficient open cover? All the information I could find about good covers of manifolds involved smooth or differentiable manifolds. On ncatlab it is only stated that the methods involved for proving the existence of good covers in the smooth case don't work in the topological case. No reference to a counterexample or other disprove is given. Note that I am not really (just sort of) interested in the cover being finite. As explained in this answer every $n$ -manifold admits a cover by $n+1$ charts. However there is no reason, why this cover should possibly be a good cover. The closest reference for finite good covers is (again according to ncatlab ) this paper by Osborn Stern. However the connectivity conditions confuse me and I don't quite understand how they replace the contractibility condition. My goal is to show in an axiomatic way (see my question here ) that for every closed $n$ -manifold the homology groups of order $>n$ vanish. I think the existence of a (possibly infinite) sufficient cover would open a way for showing this by induction on the (by compactness) finite number of sufficient opens involved. Of cause, the general existence of a finite sufficient cover would (if my inductive argument is correct) imply that for arbitrary topological $n$ -manifolds the higher homology groups vanish... I would not be surprised, if there is a good reason, why there is no good or sufficient cover in general. However, as I am fairly new to the subject of topological manifolds, I remain hopeful that there is one.

Does every topological -manifold admit a good open cover or a sufficient open cover? All the information I could find about good covers of manifolds involved smooth or differentiable manifolds. On ncatlab it is only stated that the methods involved for proving the existence of good covers in the smooth case don't work in the topological case. No reference to a counterexample or other disprove is given. Note that I am not really (just sort of) interested in the cover being finite. As explained in this answer every -manifold admits a cover by charts. However there is no reason, why this cover should possibly be a good cover. The closest reference for finite good covers is (again according to ncatlab ) this paper by Osborn Stern. However the connectivity conditions confuse me and I don't quite understand how they replace the contractibility condition. My goal is to show in an axiomatic way (see my question here ) that for every closed -manifold the homology groups of order vanish. I think the existence of a (possibly infinite) sufficient cover would open a way for showing this by induction on the (by compactness) finite number of sufficient opens involved. Of cause, the general existence of a finite sufficient cover would (if my inductive argument is correct) imply that for arbitrary topological -manifolds the higher homology groups vanish... I would not be surprised, if there is a good reason, why there is no good or sufficient cover in general. However, as I am fairly new to the subject of topological manifolds, I remain hopeful that there is one.

33,Homeomorphism Between Quotient Space and $\Bbb{R}$,Homeomorphism Between Quotient Space and,\Bbb{R},"Define an equivalence relation on the plane $X =\mathbb{R^2}$ as follows: $$(x_0, y_0) \sim (x_1,y_1)  \mbox{ if }  x_0 + y_0^2 = x_1 +y_1^2$$ Let $X^*$ be the corresponding quotient space. It is homeomorphic to a familiar space: what is it? Let $g : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ be defined by $g(x,y) := x + y^2$ . Then certainly it is continuous; moreoever, $\mathbb{R} \ni x = g(x,0)$ which shows that $g$ is surjective. Letting $[(x,y)]$ denotes the equivalence classes associated to the equivalence relation already defined, given $a \in \mathbb{R}$ , $a = w + z^2$ for some $w,z \in \mathbb{R}$ we see that $g^{-1}(\{w+z^2\}) = \{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 ~|~ g(x,y) = w + z^2 \} = \{(x,y) ~|~ x + y^2 = w + z^2 \} = [(w,z)]$ , which proves that $X^* = \{g^{-1}(\{a\}) ~|~ a \in \mathbb{R} \}$ . Therefore, there exists a continuous bijection $f : X^* \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $f$ is a homeomorphism if and only if $g$ is a quotient map, which we now prove. It suffices to show that $g$ is an open map. Given $(a,b) \times (c,d)$ , I will prove $g((a,b) \times (c,d)) = \bigcup_{y \in (c,d)} [(a,b) + y^2]$ . If $z \in g((a,b) \times (c,d))$ , the $z = g(x,y) = x + y^2$ for some $x \in (a,b)$ and $y \in (c,d)$ , which means by definition $z \in (a,b) + y^2$ . Now, if $z \in \bigcup_{y \in (c,d)} [(a,b) + y^2]$ , then $z \in (a,b) + y^2$ for some $y \in (c,d)$ ; furthermore, there is some $x \in (a,b)$ such that $z = x + y^2 = g(x,y)$ and hence $x \in g((a,b) \times (c,d))$ . Since $(a,b)$ is open and addition is a homeomorphism, each $(a,b) + y^2$ is open and hence $g((a,b) \times (c,d))$ is a union of open sets. How does this sound? I couldn't really find any full solutions online, so I am looking for a critique of my proof. EDIT: Here is an alternative proof, based on Hurkyl's suggestion. For convenience, let $[x,y]$ denote the equivalence classes instead of $[(x,y)]$ . First note that $x+y^2 + 0 = x + y^2$ which implies $[x+y^2,0] = [x,y]$ . One thing I left out above is the fact that $f \circ p = g$ , where $p : X \to X^*$ defined by $p(x,y) = [x,y]$ is the continuous surjection that projects points to the equivalence class to which they belong; this means that $f$ is given explicitly by $f[x,y] = x + y^2$ . Now define $k : \Bbb{R} \to X^*$ by $k(x)=[x,0]$ . Then $f(k(x)) = f([x,0])=x + 0^2 = x$ and $k(f[x,y]) = k(x+y^2)=[x+y^2,0]=[x,y]$ , so that $k =f^{-1}$ . But clearly $k$ is equal to the composition $p \circ h$ of continuous functions. Hence $f$ is a homeomorphism.","Define an equivalence relation on the plane as follows: Let be the corresponding quotient space. It is homeomorphic to a familiar space: what is it?

See below for a proof. I suppose that the assumptions can be weakened further if we only assume one pair, e.g. $(\tau_1, \sigma_1)$ to have a closed graph theorem available and the second pair as weak topologies relative to $\tau_1$ and $\sigma_1$. In this case, I'm sure that one can adapt the proof as in this post or that other one. What do you think? My Idea: I think that we can build on the fact that $(\ast)$ gives us that the closure of convex sets coincides, i.e. if $C \subseteq X$ and $K \subset Y$ are convex sets, we have $$ \overline{C}^{\tau_1} = \overline{C}^{\tau_2} \quad\text{and}\quad \overline{K}^{\sigma_1} = \overline{K}^{\sigma_2}. $$ Furthermore, we need some closed graph theorem for locally convex spaces. This should give us the first restriction to Fréchet spaces ( can we say more? I was hoping to get a result which would solve this problem , but afaik strong and weak operator topologies are not Fréchet ).

Furthermore, let $\tau_1, \tau_2$ be locally convex topologies on $X$ and $\sigma_1, \sigma_2$ locally convex topologies on $Y$ such that their topological duals coincide, i.e.    $${X}^{*_{\tau_1}} = X^{*_{\tau_2}}\quad\text{and}\quad {Y}^{*_{\sigma_1}} = Y^{*_{\sigma_2}}. \tag{$\ast$}$$ Under which additional assumptions do we have that their linear continuous operators coincide, i.e.   $$ \mathfrak{L}_{\tau_1, \sigma_1}(X,Y) = \mathfrak{L}_{\tau_2, \sigma_2}(X,Y) ? $$ I have a proof for this property once I assume there exista a closed graph theorem for the pairs $(\tau_1, \sigma_1)$ and $(\tau_2, \sigma_2)$. See below for a proof. I suppose that the assumptions can be weakened further if we only assume one pair, e.g. $(\tau_1, \sigma_1)$ to have a closed graph theorem available and the second pair as weak topologies relative to $\tau_1$ and $\sigma_1$. In this case, I'm sure that one can adapt the proof as in this post or that other one. What do you think? My Idea: I think that we can build on the fact that $(\ast)$ gives us that the closure of convex sets coincides, i.e. if $C \subseteq X$ and $K \subset Y$ are convex sets, we have $$ \overline{C}^{\tau_1} = \overline{C}^{\tau_2} \quad\text{and}\quad \overline{K}^{\sigma_1} = \overline{K}^{\sigma_2}. $$ Furthermore, we need some closed graph theorem for locally convex spaces. This should give us the first restriction to Fréchet spaces ( can we say more? I was hoping to get a result which would solve this problem , but afaik strong and weak operator topologies are not Fréchet ). Then, I would argue as follows: If $T \in \mathfrak{L}_{\tau_1, \sigma_1}(X,Y)$, then its graph is closed w.r.t.  the product topology $\tau_1 \times \sigma_1$ on $X\times Y$.

(Is this a sufficient analysis?) 2) $d_1(x,x)=\frac{d(x,x)}{1+d(x,x)}=\frac{0}{1+0}=0$. 3) $d_1(x,y)=\frac{d(x,y)}{1+d(x,y)}=\frac{d(y,x)}{1+d(y,x)}=d_1(y,x).$ 4) $d_1(x,y)=\frac{d(x,y)}{1+d(x,y)}\le{\frac{d(x,z)+d(z,y)}{1+d(x,z)+d(z,y)}}=\frac{d(x,z)}{1+d(x,z)+d(z,y)}+\frac{d(z,y)}{1+d(x,z)+d(z,y)}\lt\frac{d(x,z)}{1+d(x,z)}+\frac{d(z,y)}{1+d(z,y)}=d_1(x,z)+d_1(z,y).$ However, #4 is strictly less, not less than or equal to, according to my analysis, so where did I go wrong?",,"['general-topology', 'analysis', 'metric-spaces']"

Show that $X$ is compact if and only if every family of closed sets with the finite intersection property have non-empty intersection. Let define $\mathcal M:=\{A_\alpha\subset  X:A_\alpha=\overline A_\alpha\land \alpha\in I\}$ with the properties defined above, i.e. $$\bigcap \mathcal M\neq\emptyset\iff\bigcap_{\alpha\in J} A_\alpha\neq\emptyset,\;\forall J\subseteq I:|J|\in\Bbb N$$ (The right implication is obvious.) My strategy for this proof is to show that $X$ is complete and totally bounded, what is equivalent to be compact. Proof: $X$ is complete: for every Cauchy sequence $(x_n)$ in $X$ start choosing $X$ as a closed neighborhood for $x_0$ . Because $(x_n)$ is Cauchy for every $\epsilon=1/k$ exists some $N\in\Bbb N$ such that $d(x_n,x_m)<1/k$ whenever $n,m\ge N$ .

Then if $\bigcap\mathcal B\neq\emptyset$ then $X$ is complete, i.e every Cauchy sequence converges in $X$ . $X$ is totally bounded: if $X$ is not totally bounded then exists some $\epsilon>0$ such that doesnt exists a finite open cover of $X$ composed of open balls with centers in $X$ . Then for some $\epsilon>0$ the family $$C_\epsilon :=\{\Bbb B(x,\epsilon):x\in X\}$$ doesn't contain a finite subcover. Now define the family composed by the complements of $C_\epsilon$ : $$C_\epsilon^*:=\{(\Bbb B(x,\epsilon))^\complement:x\in X\}$$ then observe that the family $C_\epsilon^*$ have the finite intersection property because in other case $C_\epsilon$ would have a finite subcover. But we have that $$\bigcap C_\epsilon^*=\bigcap (\Bbb B(x,\epsilon))^\complement=\left(\bigcup \Bbb B(x,\epsilon)\right)^\complement=X^\complement=\emptyset$$ what is a contradiction about the assumptions on $X$ , then $X$ is totally bounded.

Is anyone aware of a different and/or more direct proof? Thank you! Here is my proof: Assume $X$ to be a complete and totally bounded metric space. To prove that it is compact, we need to show that it is both countably compact and Lindelöf and both of these properties are equivalent to limit point compactness and separability, respectively, so we prove those two properties. To see that $X$ is separable, note that for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$, there exists a finite $(1/n)$-net $\{x_{n,1},\dotsc,x_{n,r_n}\}$ for $X$. Then the countable set \begin{equation} S=\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}\{x_{n,1},\dotsc,x_{n,r_n}\} \end{equation} is dense in $X$, which proves that $X$ is separable. To prove that $X$ is limit point compact, let $F\subset X$ be an infinite subset. Then as $X$ is covered by finitely many balls of radius $1$, it follows that one such ball contains infinitely many members of $F$, i.e. $F\cap B_{1}(x_1)$ is infinite for some $x_1\in X$. Similarly, as $F\cap B_{1}(x_1)$ is infinite and $X$ is covered by finitely many balls of radius $1/2$, we have that $F\cap B_{1}(x_1)\cap B_{1/2}(x_2)$ is infinite for some $x_2\in X$. Continuing inductively, we obtain a sequence $\{x_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ in $X$ such that \begin{equation} E_n:=F\cap B_{1}(x_1)\cap\dotsb\cap B_{1/n}(x_n) \end{equation} is infinite for every $n\in\mathbb{N}$. I claim that $\{x_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is Cauchy. If $y_n\in E_n$ is arbitrary for $n\in\mathbb{N}$ then $\{y_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is Cauchy since the $E_n$ are nested and $\mathrm{diam}(E_n)\leq 2/n$, which in turn implies that $\{x_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is Cauchy as $d(x_n,y_n)<1/n$ for all $n$. Thus $\lim_{n\to\infty}x_n=x$ for some $x\in X$ by completeness. It remains to show that $x$ is a limit point of $F$, for which it is sufficient to show that $F\cap B_{\varepsilon}(x)$ is infinite for all $\varepsilon>0$. To see this, let $\varepsilon>0$. Choose $n\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $1/n<\varepsilon/2$ and $d(x_n,x)<\varepsilon/2$. Then $B_{1/n}(x_n)\subset B_{\varepsilon/2}(x_n)\subset B_{\varepsilon}(x)$, so we obtain \begin{equation} E_n\subset F\cap B_{1/n}(x_n)\subset F\cap B_{\varepsilon}(x). \end{equation} Hence $F\cap B_{\varepsilon}(x)$ is infinite as $E_n$ is, which completes the proof.","The proof one usually sees for this (by my knowledge) is by proving that the metric space in question is sequentially compact, as seen here: totally bounded, complete $\implies$ compact I am interested in a more direct proof involving the open covering definition of compactness.
