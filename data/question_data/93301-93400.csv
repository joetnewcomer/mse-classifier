0,Complex Integral on an ellipse around $\frac{1}{z}$,Complex Integral on an ellipse around,\frac{1}{z},"I'm working on the following problem: Given $a,b>0$, define the path $\gamma$ whose image is an ellipse.   $$\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$$ traced counterclockwise. By showing that $\int_{\gamma}z^{-1}dz = \int_{\gamma}z^{-1}dz$ for a suitable circle show that    $$\int_0^{2\pi}\frac{1}{a^2\cos^2{t}+b^2\sin^2{t}}dt=\frac{2\pi}{ab}$$ Attempt 1: Suppose $\gamma(t)= a \cos(t) + ib\sin(t)$ then we obtain $$\int_0^{2\pi}\frac{-a \sin(t) + ib\cos(t)}{a \cos(t) + ib\sin(t)}dt$$ I tired rationalizing the numerator but end up with $a^2+b^2$ in the numerator and a mess in the denominator. So I'm unable to obtain the LHS. Attempt 2: Recognize $$\int_{\gamma}\frac{1}{z}=\int\frac{\gamma'(t)}{\gamma(t)}dt=\int\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\log(\gamma(t))dt$$ so that $$\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\log(\gamma(t)) = \frac{1}{a^2\cos^2{t}+b^2\sin^2{t}}$$ Integrating in $t$ and exponentiating to solve for $\gamma$ gives a mess. It doesn't reduce either. I think here, there also maybe an issue of branch cuts that I haven't considered carefully. I also recognize that the denominator factors: $(a \cos(t) + ib\sin(t))(a \cos(t) - ib\sin(t))$ I haven't been able to use this information though. Any ideas?

I have some background in analysis, but it is weaker. In particular I know the basics of measure theory and complex analysis but only at an undergraduate level. I am really interested in the Riemann-Roch theorem, and am approaching it from an algebraic geometry perspective at the moment, but I thought the best way to learn complex analysis would be to approach from the Riemann surface point of view. With that in mind, I am looking for a complex analysis/complex geometry book that is fairly self contained in terms of complex analytic background. Since I want to learn some complex analysis as well, I would like something that doesn't shy away from analytic arguments when necessary, but I would like something with a definite geometric flavour. I feel like the standard answer here is Griffiths and Harris, so perhaps it would be good if people could give me an idea on how this book would serve me for this purpose? I got the impression is was much more algebraic geometry than complex analysis though. The other is Schlag's Complex Analysis and Riemann Surfaces if anyone is able to give me an idea of how that would serve. Does such a book exist, or an I asking too much?

5,Complex plane iteration of z^z,Complex plane iteration of z^z,,"How can I identify when the iterative sequence $z \to z^z$ is not going to head for infinity for some starting value $z$? For example, $z=1$ is fixed, since $1^1 = 1$. If $z$ is real and between 0 and 1, the iteration heads for 1, where it stays. When starting $z$ is real and greater than 1, then the iteration heads for infinity. When $z$ starts out negative, however, complex numbers quickly come into play. $-1+0i$, for instance, quickly zeros in on $1+0i$; however, $-0.5+0i$ quickly exceeds computing parameters. Restating $z$ as $x + yi$ and showing the iterations to the point of exceeding computing capacity are as follows: $$-0.5 \to -1.414213562i \to 691.6428072-369.0287525i \to NAN.$$ Guidelines for complex exponentiation here: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ComplexExponentiation.html This reminds me of the iteration behind the Mandelbrot set: $z\to z^2+c$. In the case of the Mandelbrot set, however, it's easy to identify when a $z$ is reached that will head for infinity (when the absolute value of $z$ exceeds 2). When plotting the Mandelbrot set on the complex plane, the program merely needs to catch when 2 is exceeded, and excludes the point being evaluated from the set. I would really like to see a plot of the set of points $x+iy$ on the complex plane where the iteration $x+yi \to (x+yi)^{x+yi}$ does not head for infinity. I suspect all such points zero-in on the value $1+0i$ but I am not sure they do. There may be other 'equilibrium' values, or there may be values where a repeated cycle forms (as is the case for points in the Mandelbrot set). I have done a plot for this, however, in this case I was simply assuming that the iteration was headed for infinity whenever $x$ or $y$ exceeded 10 - I'm not sure this is the case! Another problem is that the plot sometimes exclude points when they come close to $0+0i$ (calculation problem - I could fix this but the other problem of excessively high values remains). Here's the plot image: Obviously, the set is fractal in nature, so I would really like to see it calculated correctly. Most of the points excluded in the plot are excluded because they yield an iteration where $x$ or $y$ exceeds 10. I am pretty sure, however, that there are some very high numbers that do not head for infinity - having the imaginary unit in the exponent means that a very high positive input can become a very high negative input in the next iteration, such that the high negative real number in the exponent creates a real number in the iteration following that one that is very close to zero, thus zeroing-in on $1 + 0i$ in iterations following that. I even suspect that numbers that exceed my computers computing capacity (something like $10^{360}$ or something) may eventually come back to $1+0i$ if my computer could just compute further iterations. Might this in fact be the case for all starting values that contain a non-zero imaginary component? Could this be proven one way or the other?","How can I identify when the iterative sequence $z \to z^z$ is not going to head for infinity for some starting value $z$?

In the case of the Mandelbrot set, however, it's easy to identify when a $z$ is reached that will head for infinity (when the absolute value of $z$ exceeds 2). When plotting the Mandelbrot set on the complex plane, the program merely needs to catch when 2 is exceeded, and excludes the point being evaluated from the set. I would really like to see a plot of the set of points $x+iy$ on the complex plane where the iteration $x+yi \to (x+yi)^{x+yi}$ does not head for infinity. I suspect all such points zero-in on the value $1+0i$ but I am not sure they do. There may be other 'equilibrium' values, or there may be values where a repeated cycle forms (as is the case for points in the Mandelbrot set). I have done a plot for this, however, in this case I was simply assuming that the iteration was headed for infinity whenever $x$ or $y$ exceeded 10 - I'm not sure this is the case! Another problem is that the plot sometimes exclude points when they come close to $0+0i$ (calculation problem - I could fix this but the other problem of excessively high values remains). Here's the plot image: Obviously, the set is fractal in nature, so I would really like to see it calculated correctly. Most of the points excluded in the plot are excluded because they yield an iteration where $x$ or $y$ exceeds 10. I am pretty sure, however, that there are some very high numbers that do not head for infinity - having the imaginary unit in the exponent means that a very high positive input can become a very high negative input in the next iteration, such that the high negative real number in the exponent creates a real number in the iteration following that one that is very close to zero, thus zeroing-in on $1 + 0i$ in iterations following that. I even suspect that numbers that exceed my computers computing capacity (something like $10^{360}$ or something) may eventually come back to $1+0i$ if my computer could just compute further iterations. Might this in fact be the case for all starting values that contain a non-zero imaginary component? Could this be proven one way or the other?",,"['complex-analysis', 'exponentiation', 'complex-dynamics']"

I think I might have trouble with each of the exercises and there are 13 more. So, if anyone knows of a existing solution manual for the text, please let me know. I'm not a student so just trying to learn this on my own. Otherwise, I'll just keep trying one per day and posting to this list when I'm stuck. Thanks a lot.",,['complex-analysis']

I would prefer solutions via elementary methods. Here is my attempt: By definition we have $\frac{e^{iz}+e^{-iz}}{2}=\frac{3}{4}+\frac{i}{4} \implies e^{iz}+e^{-iz}=\frac{3}{2}+\frac{i}{2}$. Let $t=e^{iz}$ so then we have $t+\frac{1}{t}=\frac{3}{2}+\frac{i}{2}$ and if we multiply both sides by $t$ we have $t^2+1=(\frac{3}{2}+\frac{i}{2})t$ and hence $t^2+(\frac{3}{2}+\frac{i}{2})t+1=0$ By the quadratic formula for complex numbers we have, $a=1, b=\frac{3}{2}+\frac{i}{2}, c=1 \implies z=\frac{-(\frac{3}{2}+\frac{i}{2}) \pm \sqrt{(\frac{3}{2}+\frac{i}{2})^2-4(1)(1)}}{2(1)}$. Simplyifing we have $z=\frac{-\frac{3}{2}-(\frac{1}{2})i \pm \sqrt{-2+(\frac{3}{2})i}}{2}$ We wish to express $-2+(\frac{3}{3})i$ in polar form so we have $|-2+(\frac{3}{2})i|=\frac{5}{2}$. Now equating the real and imaginary parts we have $\frac{5}{2}\cos(\theta)=-2 \implies \cos(\theta)=-\frac{4}{5}$ and $\frac{5}{2}\sin(\theta)=\frac{3}{2} \implies \sin(\theta)=\frac{3}{5}$. From this we have $\tan(\theta)=-\frac{3}{4} \implies \theta=\arctan(-\frac{3}{4}) \approx -.6435$ rad. So we have $w=-2+(\frac{3}{2})i=\frac{5}{4}(\cos(\theta)+i\sin(\theta))=\frac{5}{4}e^{i\theta}$. By Proposition 1.3.12 we have $\sqrt{w}=\sqrt{\frac{5}{4}}e^{\frac{i\theta}{2}}=\frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}e^{\frac{i\theta}{2}}$.

Thus using the Residue Theorem and l'Hôpital's Rule: $$\lim_{z\rightarrow (k+\frac{1}{2})a}\frac{(z-(k+\frac{1}{2})a)e^{-z^2}}{1+e^{-2az}}=\lim_{z\rightarrow (k+\frac{1}{2})a}\frac{\frac{d}{dz}(z-(k+\frac{1}{2})a)e^{-z^2}}{\frac{d}{dz}1+e^{-2az}}=\frac{e^{-(k+\frac{1}{2})^2a^2}}{-2ae^{-2(k+\frac{1}{2})a^2}}=\frac{e^{-k^2a^2-ka^2-\frac{a^2}{4}}}{-2ae^{-2ka^2-a^2}}=\frac{e^{-\pi ik^2-\pi ik-\frac{\pi i}{4}}}{-2ae^{-2\pi ik-\pi i}}=\frac{e^{\frac{-\pi i}{4}}}{2\sqrt{\pi}e^{\frac{\pi i}{4}}}=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{\pi}i}$$ It can be shown that $f(z)-f(z+a)=e^{-z^2}$ (I wont prove this but it's most definitely true).  I'm going to integrate this function around the contour which is a rhombus slanting to the right whose bottom two corners lie at $-R$ and $R$.  Thus we have: $$\lim_{R\rightarrow\infty}\bigg[\int_{-R}^{R}f+\int_{R+at}f+\int_{R+a}^{-R+a}f+\int_{R+a(1-t)}f\bigg]=\sum_{k\geq 0}\sqrt{\pi}$$ for $0\leq t\leq 1$. Making the substitutions $u=z-a$ for the third integral and then $v=1-t$ for the fourth, and then taking $R\rightarrow\infty$, we obtain: $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-z^2}dz=\sum_{k\geq 0}\sqrt{\pi}$$ Whew! Ok so clearly all I really want is just one $\sqrt{\pi}$, not an infinite number of them.  But when I take $R\rightarrow\infty$ my rhombus contains all the poles in the upper-half plane.  Can anyone tell where I went wrong?",,"['complex-analysis', 'residue-calculus']"

Modify the proof of Theorem 11.30 to show that $u=P[f]$ for some $f\in L^1(T)$. Before stating Theorem 11.30, one needs theorem 11.29. Theorem 11.29: Suppose that (a)$X$ is a separable Banach space, (b)${\Lambda_n}$ is a sequence of linear functionals on $X$, (c)$sup_n||\Lambda_n||=M<\infty$ Then there is a subsequence $\{\Lambda_{n_i}\}$ such that the limit $$\Lambda x=\lim_{i\to\infty}\Lambda_{n_i} x$$ exists for every $x\in X$. Moreover, $\Lambda$ is linear, and $||\Lambda||\leq M$ Proof (Sketch): Note that $\{\Lambda_n\}$ is pointwise bounded and equicontinuous. Since each point of $X$ is a compact set, Theorem 11.29 follows from Arzela-Ascoli Theorem. Besides, it is obvious that $||\Lambda||\leq M$ and that $\Lambda$ is linear. Theorem 11.30: Suppose $u$ is harmonic in $U$, and $$sup_{0<r<1} ||u_r||_1=M<\infty$$ It follows that there is a unique complex Borel measure $\mu$ on $T$ so that $u=P[d\mu]$ Proof: Define linear functionals $\Lambda_r$ on $C(T)$ by $$\Lambda_r g=\int_T gu_rd\sigma\quad (0\leq r<1)$$ Therefore, $||\Lambda_r||\leq M$. By Theorem 11.29 and Riesz representation theorem for the dual of $C(T)$ there is a measure $\mu$ on $T$, with $||\mu$$||\leq M$, and a sequence $r_j\to 1$, so that $$\lim_{j\to\infty}\int_T gu_{r_j}d\sigma=\int_T gd\mu\quad (*)$$ for every $g\in C(T)$. Put $h_j(z)=u(r_j z)$. Then $h_j$ is harmonic in $U$, continuous on $\bar{U}$, and is therefore the Poisson integral of its restriction to $T$. Fix $z\in U$, and apply $(*)$ with $$g(e^{it})=P(z,e^{it})$$ Since $h_j(e^{it})=u_{r_j}(e^{it})$, we obtain $$u(z)=\lim_j u(r_j z)=\lim_j h_j(z)$$, and $$\lim_j h_j(z)=\lim_j\int_T P(z,e^{it})h_j(e^{it})d\sigma(e^{it})=\int_T P(z,e^{it})d\mu(e^{it})=P[d\mu](z)$$ To prove uniqueness, it suffices to show that $P[d\mu]=0$ implies $\mu=0$. Pick $f\in C(T)$, put $u=P[f]$, $v=p[d\mu]$. By Fubini's theorem, and the symmetry $P(re^{i\theta},e^{it})=P(re^{it},e^{i\theta})$, $$\int_T u_rd\mu=\int_T v_rfd\sigma\quad (0\leq r<1)$$ When $v=0$ then $v_r=0$, and since $u_r\to f$ uniformly, as $r\to 1$, we conclude that $$\int_T fd\mu=0$$ for every $f\in C(T)$ if $P[d\mu]=0$. By Riesz representation theorem, $\mu=0$. Any hints will be appreciated. I've really no idea how to modify the proof of Themorem 11.30, because the $L^1$-boundedness of the family $\{u_r\}$ seemes to play an important role in the proof. However, I cannot see the relationship between the boundedness and uniformly integrability. I have goolged this problem, but I cannot find anything helpful.

Theorem 11.29: Suppose that (a)$X$ is a separable Banach space, (b)${\Lambda_n}$ is a sequence of linear functionals on $X$, (c)$sup_n||\Lambda_n||=M<\infty$ Then there is a subsequence $\{\Lambda_{n_i}\}$ such that the limit $$\Lambda x=\lim_{i\to\infty}\Lambda_{n_i} x$$ exists for every $x\in X$. Moreover, $\Lambda$ is linear, and $||\Lambda||\leq M$ Proof (Sketch): Note that $\{\Lambda_n\}$ is pointwise bounded and equicontinuous. Since each point of $X$ is a compact set, Theorem 11.29 follows from Arzela-Ascoli Theorem. Besides, it is obvious that $||\Lambda||\leq M$ and that $\Lambda$ is linear. Theorem 11.30: Suppose $u$ is harmonic in $U$, and $$sup_{0<r<1} ||u_r||_1=M<\infty$$ It follows that there is a unique complex Borel measure $\mu$ on $T$ so that $u=P[d\mu]$ Proof: Define linear functionals $\Lambda_r$ on $C(T)$ by $$\Lambda_r g=\int_T gu_rd\sigma\quad (0\leq r<1)$$ Therefore, $||\Lambda_r||\leq M$. By Theorem 11.29 and Riesz representation theorem for the dual of $C(T)$ there is a measure $\mu$ on $T$, with $||\mu$$||\leq M$, and a sequence $r_j\to 1$, so that $$\lim_{j\to\infty}\int_T gu_{r_j}d\sigma=\int_T gd\mu\quad (*)$$ for every $g\in C(T)$. Put $h_j(z)=u(r_j z)$. Then $h_j$ is harmonic in $U$, continuous on $\bar{U}$, and is therefore the Poisson integral of its restriction to $T$. Fix $z\in U$, and apply $(*)$ with $$g(e^{it})=P(z,e^{it})$$ Since $h_j(e^{it})=u_{r_j}(e^{it})$, we obtain $$u(z)=\lim_j u(r_j z)=\lim_j h_j(z)$$, and $$\lim_j h_j(z)=\lim_j\int_T P(z,e^{it})h_j(e^{it})d\sigma(e^{it})=\int_T P(z,e^{it})d\mu(e^{it})=P[d\mu](z)$$ To prove uniqueness, it suffices to show that $P[d\mu]=0$ implies $\mu=0$. Pick $f\in C(T)$, put $u=P[f]$, $v=p[d\mu]$. By Fubini's theorem, and the symmetry $P(re^{i\theta},e^{it})=P(re^{it},e^{i\theta})$, $$\int_T u_rd\mu=\int_T v_rfd\sigma\quad (0\leq r<1)$$ When $v=0$ then $v_r=0$, and since $u_r\to f$ uniformly, as $r\to 1$, we conclude that $$\int_T fd\mu=0$$ for every $f\in C(T)$ if $P[d\mu]=0$. By Riesz representation theorem, $\mu=0$. Any hints will be appreciated. I've really no idea how to modify the proof of Themorem 11.30, because the $L^1$-boundedness of the family $\{u_r\}$ seemes to play an important role in the proof. However, I cannot see the relationship between the boundedness and uniformly integrability. I have goolged this problem, but I cannot find anything helpful.

54,Two basic complex analysis homework questions,Two basic complex analysis homework questions,,"I have some homework problems from Greene and Krantz' Function Theory of One Complex Variable .

In another question, the goal is to prove this when the disk and its boundary are in the region of holomorticity of the $f_j$.

Of course, the same happens for the family of functions $f_{\lambda}(z)=e^{-\lambda z}$ where $\lambda >0$ is a positive parameter. In fact, if $\lambda$ is bigger, the decay is faster.

So if each term in it's power series is uniformly continuous on $\mathbb{C}$, then the function will be uniformly continuous on $\mathbb{C}$. Am I on the right track?

99,Can the Fourier transform be defined as an integration over $\mathbb C$ instead of $\mathbb R$?,Can the Fourier transform be defined as an integration over  instead of ?,\mathbb C \mathbb R,"Can the Fourier transform of a whole function $f:\mathbb R\mapsto\mathbb C$ be defined as integration over $\mathbb C$ instead of $\mathbb R$ as well, such that    $$\tilde f(k) = \frac{\mathcal N}{2\pi} \int_{\mathbb C}f(x) e^{-ikx}\,dx,$$ and (if so) what is the correct value of the normalization $\mathcal N$ for consistency with the $\mathbb R$-integration? Given a whole function $f:\mathbb R\mapsto\mathbb C$, its Fourier transform $$ \tilde f(k) = \frac1{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x)e^{-ikx}\,dx$$ can be determined by other integration paths as well by using Cauchy's Residue Theorem, for example by shifting $x$ by an imaginary constant $ic$. Assuming a sufficiently fast decaying function for $\Re(x)\to\pm\infty$ (and using the fact that a whole function has no residues), this results in simply adding that constant to the integration boundaries, i.e. $$ \tilde f(k) = \frac1{2\pi}\int_{-\infty+ic}^{\infty+ic} f(x)e^{-ikx}\,dx,$$ which can be expressed by substitution as well: $$ \tilde f(k) = \frac1{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x-ic)e^{-ik(x-ic)}\,dx.$$ One can then average over different values of $c$ to obtain $$ \tilde f(k) = \frac1{2\pi\cdot 2T}\int_{-T}^{T}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x-ic)e^{-ik(x-ic)}\,dx\,dc.$$ Now my question boils down to 1) Since infinity is involved, is this equivalent to $$ \tilde f(k) = \frac1{4\pi T}\int_{\mathbb R\times[-iT,iT]} f(x_1+x_2)e^{-ik(x_1+x_2)}\,d^2x,$$ 2) Can the limit $T\to\infty$ be taken such that $\mathbb R\times[-iT,iT]\to\mathbb C$ and 3) What would the correct normalization be?","Can the Fourier transform of a whole function $f:\mathbb R\mapsto\mathbb C$ be defined as integration over $\mathbb C$ instead of $\mathbb R$ as well, such that    $$\tilde f(k) = \frac{\mathcal N}{2\pi} \int_{\mathbb C}f(x) e^{-ikx}\,dx,$$ and (if so) what is the correct value of the normalization $\mathcal N$ for consistency with the $\mathbb R$-integration?
