Question Let $p$ and $q$ be primes with $p<q$.  Prove that a non-abelian group of order $pq$ has a nonnormal subgroup of index $q$, so there there eixists and injective homomorphism into $S_q$ First I prove a Lemma : If $H\triangleleft G$, then for every conjugacy class $\mathcal{K} \subseteq H$ or $\mathcal{K} \cap H = \emptyset$. proof : If $x\in K\cap H$, then $gxg^{-1} \in gHg^{-1}$ for all $g\in G$.  Since $H$ is normal $gHg^{-1}=H$, so that $H$ contains all the conjugates of $x$,i.e., $\mathcal{K} \subseteq H$ (Dummit and Foot, 4ed, pg 127). Here's my attempt on the question: proof : Let $G$ be a group such that $|G|=pq$ and $p<q$. Then $G \cong \mathbb{Z}_{pq}$, and so $G$ has two subgroups, say $H$ and $K$, of orders $p$ and $q$, respectively .  'Suppose that $H$ is a subgroup in $G$ of order $p$; a subgroup $K$ of order $q$ exists in $G$ by Cauchy (Nicky Hekster).'  Also, by Lagrange, $H=\langle x \rangle$ and $K=\langle y \rangle$ for some $y,x \in G$.  Since $p$ is the smallest prime that divides the order of $G$ and $|G:K|=p$, then $K\triangleleft G$ (by some theorem). Suppose, by contradiction, that $H\triangleleft G$.  Then for $x^i \in H$, $gx^ig^{-1}=x^k \in H$ for all $g\in G$.  So $H\subseteq \mathcal{O}_{x^i}$ (the conjugacy class of $x_i$).  Since $|x^i|$ divides $p$, then $x_i\not \in K$.  Thus $\mathcal{O}_{x_i} \not \subseteq K$.  Also, since $e=x^p$ and $gx^pg^{-1}=e$, then $e\in \mathcal{O}_{x_i}$.  Thus $\mathcal{O}_{x_i} \cap K \neq \emptyset$.  Therefore $K$ is not normal in $G$, which is absurd. Now let $\phi: G \rightarrow S_q$ be the permutations representation afforded by the action of $G$ on $A=G/H$ by left multiplication -- say $\pi_g:A\rightarrow A$ defined by $aH\mapsto gaH$ for all $g\in G, \; aH\in A$.  We know that $\ker \pi_g \leq H$ and $\ker \pi_g \triangleleft G$.  Since $|H|=p$, then $|\ker \pi_g|=p$ or $|\ker \pi_g|=1$.  If $|\ker \pi_g|=p$, then $\ker \pi_g$ is not normal in $G$.  Therefore, $|\ker \pi_g|=1$.  Since $\ker \pi_g=\ker \phi$, then $\phi$ must be injective.

I've been trying to figure out the problem though and could use some help. a) Does there exist a surjective homomphism $\phi: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow S_3$? Explain. What I'm thinking: Let $\phi: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow S_3$ be a homomorphism.$\mathbb{Z}$ is a cyclic group and thus $\phi(\mathbb{Z})$ is cyclic. However, $S_3$ is not cyclic. Thus $\phi(\mathbb{Z}) \neq S_3$ and $\phi$ cannot be surjective. b) Assume that there exist homomorphisms $\phi: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow S_3$ where Ker$(\phi) \neq \mathbb{Z}$. What are the possible kernels? Explain. What I'm thinking: Since $1$ generates $\mathbb{Z}$, if $1\in$ Ker$(\phi)$, then $\mathbb{Z}=$Ker$(\phi)$. So could Ker$(\phi)$ = $n\mathbb{Z}$ for $n \in \mathbb{Z},  \; n\neq1$? c)List at least two non-trivial homomorphisms $\phi: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow S_3$ whose kernals are not $\mathbb{Z}$. $\phi_1(n) = (1\; 2)^n$ $\phi_2(n) = (1\; 3)^n$ Any input is much appreciated!",,"['abstract-algebra', 'group-theory']"

Multiplication in $\mathbb{C}(G)$ is induced by the group multiplication of $G$ and extends to $\mathbb{C}(G)$ by linearity. In a similar fashion, we can define a ""group Lie algebra"" $\mathfrak{L}(G)=\{c_1g_1+c_2g_2+\ldots+c_n g_n|c_i\in \mathbb{C},g_i\in G\}$ , which is the same as $\mathbb{C}(G)$ as a linear vector space, but in $\mathfrak{L}(G)$ only the Lie bracket $[,]:\mathfrak{L}(G)\times \mathfrak{L}(G)\to \mathfrak{L}(G)$ is defined, to be the commutator in $\mathbb{C}(G)$ , i.e. $[l_1,l_2]=l_1\cdot l_2-l_2\cdot l_1$ , where "" $\cdot$ "" is the multiplication in $\mathbb{C}(G)$ . My problem is to determine the structure of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{L}(G)$ for the symmetric group $G=S_N$ . Let us take $S_3$ as an example. Since $|S_3|=6$ , the group algebra $\mathbb{C}(S_3)$ of $S_3$ is 6-dimensional, spanned by $\{1,P_{12},P_{23},P_{13},P_{12}P_{23},P_{23}P_{12}\}$ . It is easy to see that $\{1,I,I^2\}$ are central elements (i.e. commute with everything in $\mathbb{C}(S_3)$ ), where $I=P_{12}+P_{23}+P_{13}$ . The 3-dimensional subspace orthogonal to these central elements is spanned by $\{P_{12}-P_{23},P_{12}-P_{13},[P_{12},P_{23}]\}$ , which forms an $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ Lie algebra, their relation to the spin generators are $$P_{12}-P_{23}=\sqrt{6}(s_x-s_y),~~P_{12}-P_{13}=\sqrt{6}(s_x-s_z),~~[P_{12},P_{23}]=2i(s_x+s_y+s_z),$$ where $[s_i,s_j]=i\epsilon_{ijk}s_k$ . Therefore we conclude that $\mathfrak{L}(S_3)=\mathfrak{u}(1)^3\oplus \mathfrak{su}(2)$ . But when trying to determine the structure of $\mathfrak{L}(S_N)$ for arbitrary $N$ ,  this kind of brute force calculation seems hopeless. I don't  even know the structure of $\mathfrak{L}(S_4)$ . For large $N$ , I want to know this: if $\mathfrak{L}(S_N)$ is a direct sum of simple Lie algebras, let $d_N$ be the dimension of its largest irreducible(simple) component (e.g. $d_3=3$ ).

It is easy to solve the exercise if we prove that $N_{D_{2n}}(P)=P$ and that's what I can't prove. Could you give me some hints? My attempt I got the following results. They might be useless, but who knows? 1) If $a=1$ then Sylow $2$-subgroups of $D_{2n}$ have order $2$ and so their number is the number of elements of $D_{2n}$ of order $2$ which is $n$ because the set of elements of order $2$ of $D_{2n}$ is $\{sr^i:i\in\{0,\,\dots,\,n-1\}\}$.
