0,Is this variant of the Jordan Curve Theorem true?,Is this variant of the Jordan Curve Theorem true?,,"This feels as though it should be falsifiable, but it's not immediately obvious to me.  The informal version of the statement is 'for every non-intersecting curve between two opposite corners of a square, there's a curve between the other two corners that only intersects it once.'  Formally: Let $f(): [0, 1]\mapsto [0,1]^2$ be a non-self-intersecting curve   with $f(0) = \langle0,0\rangle$, $f(1) = \langle1,1\rangle$, and $f(t)\in (0,1)^2$ for   $t\in(0,1)$.  (Note that I'm requiring that all but the endpoints of the curve lie in the open square!)  Then there exists a non-self-intersecting curve $g():  [0, 1]\mapsto [0,1]^2$ with $g(0) = \langle1,0\rangle$, $g(1) = \langle0,1\rangle$, and   $g(t)\in (0,1)^2$ for $t\in(0,1)$ such that there are unique $t_0$ and $ t_1$ with $f(t_0) = g(t_1)$.

We can shrink $R$ to be as close to $r$ as we want, so we can essentially constrain the annulus down to a circle and thus force any path from the left side of the circle to the right side to go through $P$ or $Q$. So holding $s \in (0, 1)$ constant and varying $t$ must produce a path through $P$ or $Q$ for any $s$.

8,How much topology for graph theory?,How much topology for graph theory?,,"I am writing a thesis in the context of descriptive complexity in theoretical computer science and therefore need to study a little bit of graph theory.

A surface is a compact connected Hausdorf topological space $S$ in which every point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to the Euclidian plane $\mathbb{R}^2$. An arc, a circle and a disc in $S$ are subsets that are homeomorphic in the subspace topology to the real interval $[0,1]$, to the unit circle $S^1 = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid \|x\|=1\}$, and to the unit disc $\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \mid \|x\| \leq 1\}$, respectively.

Definition: Consider the space $X^* \subset X \times X$ given as $X^* = \{(x, xs) \mid x \in X, s \in G\}$. For all $(x, y) \in X^*$ there is a unique $\tau(x, y) \in G$ such that $x \tau(x, y) = y$.

Definition: Consider a principal $G$-bundle $\xi: X \to B$, and let $F$ be a left $G$-space. The formula $(x, y)s = (xs, s^{-1}y)$ gives a structure of a right $G$-space on $X \times F$.

53,Do the lifts of commuting circle homeomorphisms commute?,Do the lifts of commuting circle homeomorphisms commute?,,"I am going over proofs of the following result concerning the rotation number of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of the circle: If $f, g \in \text{Homeo}^+(S^1)$ commute with respect to composition (i.e. $f\circ g = g\circ f$ ), then $\rho(f\circ g) = \rho(f) + \rho(g)$ where $\rho(f) \in S^1$ is the rotation number. The Problem: From what I've seen on this site (e.g., here ), the proof involves lifting $f$ and $g$ to maps $F$ and $G$ on $\mathbb{R}$ , and then utilizing $F\circ G = G\circ F$ . But I'm having trouble seeing why the lifts must commute. My work so far: Certainly it is clear from $f\circ g = g\circ f$ that the lifts satisfy $\pi\circ(F\circ G) = \pi\circ(G\circ F)$ , where $\pi : \mathbb{R} \to S^1$ is the canonical covering map. Therefore the map $F\circ G - G\circ F$ maps $\mathbb{R}$ into $\mathbb{Z}$ . So by continuity of the lifts, there is a constant $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $F\circ G = G \circ F + k$ . Thus the problem reduces to showing $k = 0$ . I can at least prove that $k \in \{-1,0,1\}$ by the following method: let $F$ and $G$ be the lifts such that $F(0),G(0) \in [0,1)$ . Then $F(G(0)) \in [F(0), F(0)+1) \subseteq [0,2)$ and $G(F(0)) \in [G(0), G(0)+1) \subseteq [0,2)$ . Immediately it follows that $|k| = |F(G(0)) - G(F(0))| < 2$ . However, I can't seem to proceed from here. It should be noted that it doesn't matter which lifts of $f$ and $g$ we pick, because if $F_1, F_2$ lift $f$ and $G_1, G_2$ lift $g$ , then there exist constants $p, q \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $F_1 = F_2 + p$ and $G_1 = G_2 + q$ . It follows that $$ F_1 \circ G_1 = F_1 \circ (G_2 + q) = (F_1 \circ G_2) + q = [(F_2 + p)\circ G_2] + q = F_2 \circ G_2 + p + q $$ and $$ G_1 \circ F_1 = G_1 \circ (F_2 + p) = (G_1 \circ F_2) + p = [(G_2 + q)\circ F_2] + p = G_2 \circ F_2 + p + q $$ hence $F_1\circ G_1 = G_1 \circ F_1$ if and only if $F_2 \circ G_2 = G_2 \circ F_2$ . It should also be noted that it is absolutely necessary (at least for the linked proof) that $k = 0$ , because otherwise $F\circ G = G\circ F + k$ implies that $(F\circ G)^n = F^n\circ G^n$ plus some quadratic function of $n$ (I believe it's $k$ times the $n$ th triangular number, but I've not worked the details).

61,Alternative way of defining a topology,Alternative way of defining a topology,,"tl;dr : In trying to come up with a way to characterize topologies in terms of neighborhoods (rather than open sets) I run into a weird, not-quite-equivalent-to-topology structure. I wonder if I can fix my definition to give actual topologies, or else what can be said about the structure I have defined. Definition : Given a set $X$ , an n-topology $\tau$ on a set $X$ assigns to each $x \in X$ a set $\tau_x \subseteq \mathcal P(X)$ satisfying the following constraints: $X \in \tau_x$ If $N \in \tau_x$ then $x \in N$ If $N \in \tau_x$ and $N' \supseteq N$ then $N' \in \tau_x$ If $N, N' \in \tau_x$ , then $N \cap N' \in \tau_x$ . We call the sets in $\tau_x$ the neighborhoods of $x$ . Clearly, given a topology on a set $X$ we get an n-topology: we take the sets $\tau_x$ to be the neighborhoods of $x \in X$ in the topological sense, as all sets which contain an open set which contains $x$ . Conversely, given an n-topology, we obtain a topology by declaring a set open if it is a neighborhood of all of its elements. Furthermore, we can define continuous functions on n-topological spaces by saying that $f : (X, \tau) \to (Y, \sigma)$ is n-continuous if $$ N \in \sigma_{f(x)} \implies f^{-1}(N) \in \tau_x. $$ It appears that this notion coincides with our usual notion of continuous. Going from topology to n-topology to topology, we recover the original topology. However, going from n-topology to topology to n-topology, we might lose information. For example, we can define an n-topology on $\omega$ by stating that $\tau_0$ contains all cofinite sets containing 0, while $\tau_n$ for $n > 0$ contains only $\omega$ itself. This clearly satisfies the above conditions. If we turn it into a topology, we just get the indiscrete topology $\{\emptyset, \omega\}$ on $\omega$ , which we could also have gotten by taking $\tau_n = \{\omega\}$ for each $n \in \omega$ . Question : Can I add a condition to this notion of ""n-topology"" to make it an equivalent definition to ordinary topologies?

If we fix $v_0\in S^n$, the transitivity of $O(n+1)$ means that to every $x\in X$ there exists $A_x\in O(n+1)$ such that $A_xv_0=f(x)$. Question: Can we chose the matrices $A_x$ in such a way that the map   $$F:X\to O(n+1),\quad x\mapsto A_x$$   is continuous ? It would be sufficient to show that the evaluation map $$\Phi:O(n+1)\to S^n,\quad \Phi(A)=Av_0$$ has a continuous right inverse $$\Psi:S^n\to O(n+1).$$ In that case we can take $F=\Psi\circ f$.","The set $O(n+1)$ of orthogonal matrices acts transitively on $S^n\subseteq\Bbb R^{n+1}$, meaning that for every $x,y\in S^n$ there is a matrix $A\in O(n+1)$ such that $Ax=y$. Now suppose that $X$ is a topological space and that we have a continuous map $f:X\to S^n$.

It is well-known that any compact metrizable space can be expressed as a quotient of the Cantor set.  But can every homeomorphism of such a space be lifted to a homeomorphism of the Cantor set?
