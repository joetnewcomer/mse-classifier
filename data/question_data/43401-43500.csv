3,Proof that the integers have no zero divisors.,Proof that the integers have no zero divisors.,,"There is a proposition in the Tao's Analysis book in the chapter four. I cannot prove it and I almost sure that should be too easy to do. Definition 1: For any $a,b,c,d\in \mathbb{N}$ we shall write $\langle a,b \rangle \sim \langle c,d \rangle \iff a+_{\mathbb{N}}d=b+_{\mathbb{N}}c$ Definition 2: The sum of two integers $\langle a,b \rangle +_{\mathbb{Z}} \langle c,d \rangle$ is defined by the formula: $\langle a,b \rangle +_{\mathbb{Z}} \langle c,d \rangle:= \langle a+_{\mathbb{N}}c\,,\,b+_{\mathbb{N}}d\rangle $. The product of two integers  $\langle a,b \rangle \cdot_{\mathbb{Z}} \langle c,d \rangle:= \langle\, a\cdot_{\mathbb{N}}c+_{\mathbb{N}}b\cdot_{\mathbb{N}}d\,,\, b\cdot_{\mathbb{N}}c+_{\mathbb{N}}a\cdot_{\mathbb{N}}d\, \rangle. $ Lemma 1: Addition and multiplication are well-defined. Proof: Suppose that $\langle a,b\rangle,\langle a',b'\rangle,\langle  c,d\rangle, \langle c',d'\rangle \in \mathbb{N}\times \mathbb{N}$ and   that $\langle a,b\rangle \sim \langle a',b'\rangle$, $\langle  c,d\rangle \sim \langle c',d'\rangle$.

14,Ways $S_3$ can act on a set of 4 elements.,Ways  can act on a set of 4 elements.,S_3,"Describe all ways in which $S_3$ can operate on a set of four elements. My approach : This question can be broken down into: How many homomorphisms exist from $S_3$ to $S_4$. Say $\varphi : S_3 \to S_4$ is a homomorphism. Then we have three possibilities for $\text{ker }\varphi$: $\{1\}, \{1, (1\ 2\ 3), (1\ 3\ 2)\}$, and $S_3$. The case in which $\text{ker }\varphi = S_3$ is the trivial homomorphism that maps everything to the identity. Now, the case in which $\text{ker }\varphi = \{1\}$ is the same as saying that the mappings are injective. This comes down to picking three of the four elements and permutating them and leaving the fourth one fixed. There are $\binom43 = 4$ ways of doing this. Say $\text{ker }\varphi = \{1, (1\ 2\ 3), (1\ 3\ 2)\}$. This means that $\varphi((1)) = \varphi((1\ 2\ 3)) = \varphi((1\ 3\ 2)) = (1)$. Morover we can observe the following two properties immediately: $\varphi((1\ 2\ 3)) = \varphi((1\ 3))\varphi((1\ 2)) = (1)$. Equivalently $\varphi((1\ 2)) = \varphi((1\ 3))$. $\varphi((1\ 3\ 2)) = \varphi((1\ 3))\varphi((2\ 3)) = (1)$.

We can map $(1\ 3)$ to any 2-cycle in $S_4$, of which there are 6, as well as any product of disjoint 2-cycles, of which there are 3. Hence we have 9 possible homomorphic mappings given this kernel. Adding up all the possible homomorphisms from $S_3$ to $S_4$ that we counted, we get 14 different ways in which $S_3$ can act on four elements, as described above. Is this correct ?

My approach : This question can be broken down into: How many homomorphisms exist from $S_3$ to $S_4$. Say $\varphi : S_3 \to S_4$ is a homomorphism. Then we have three possibilities for $\text{ker }\varphi$: $\{1\}, \{1, (1\ 2\ 3), (1\ 3\ 2)\}$, and $S_3$. The case in which $\text{ker }\varphi = S_3$ is the trivial homomorphism that maps everything to the identity. Now, the case in which $\text{ker }\varphi = \{1\}$ is the same as saying that the mappings are injective.

We say that $G$ acts on $A$ if there is a map $G\times A \rightarrow A$ denoted by $g \ast a$ satisfying $1 \ast a = a$ for all $a \in A$ and $g_1 \ast (g_2 \ast a) =(g_1g_2)\ast a$ for all $g_1,g_2 \in G$ and $a \in A$ . I've also seen that you can define a group action of $G$ on $A$ to be any homomorphism from $G \rightarrow S_{A}$ ; i.e a homomorphism from $G$ into the set of bijections of $A$ . We also know that for each $g$ in $G$ we can specify $\sigma(g):A \rightarrow A$ by $a \mapsto g \ast a$ , I wanted to understand why both definitions are the same, and I believe it follows from the following claim. Claim : Let $G$ act on $A$ . The map $\varphi:G \rightarrow S_A$ defined by $g \mapsto \sigma_g$ is a homomorphism. Conversely, given any homomorphism $\phi:G \rightarrow S_A$ , the map $G \times A \rightarrow A$ by $g \ast a = \phi(g)(a)$ is a group action. The proof is straightforward, Want to show that $\varphi:G \rightarrow S_A$ ; where recall $S_A$ is the set of all bijections of $A$ , defined by $g \mapsto \sigma_g$ is a homomorphism. Let $g_1,g_2 \in G$ , then for any $a \in A$ , \begin{align*} 		\varphi(g_1g_2)(a) & = \sigma_{g_1g_2}(a) \\ 		& = (g_1g_2) \ast a \\ 		& = g_1 \ast (g_2 \ast a) \\ 		& = g_1 \ast (\sigma_{g_2}(a)) \\ 		& = \sigma_{g_1}(\sigma_{g_2}(a)) \\ 		& = (\sigma_{g_1} \circ \sigma_{g_2})(a) \\ 		& = (\varphi(g_1) \circ \varphi(g_2))(a). 	\end{align*} Therefore the map $\varphi:G \rightarrow S_A$ by $g \mapsto \sigma_g$ is a homomorphism. Next let $\phi:G \rightarrow S_A$ be a homomorphism, we want to show that $g \ast a = \phi(g)(a)$ is an action of $G$ on $A$ . Because $\phi$ is a homomorphism we know that $\phi(1_G) = 1_{S_A}$ and so $1 \ast a = 1(a) = a$ , next let $g_1,g_2 \in G$ and \begin{align*} 		(g_1g_2)\ast a &= \varphi(g_1g_2)(a)\\ 		&=(\varphi(g_1) \circ \varphi(g_2))(a) \\ 		& = \varphi(g_1)(\varphi(g_2)(a)) \\ 		& = g_1 \ast (\varphi(g_2)(a)) \\ 		& = g_1 \ast(g_2 \ast a). 	\end{align*} So we conclude that any homomorphism from $G \rightarrow S_A$ gives rise to a valid action of $G$ on $A$ by $g \ast a = \varphi(g) (a)$ . So what is this really saying? I understand that if we have a homomorphism from $G$ into the symmetric group on $A$ we have a valid action, but don't we also need that any action is a homomorphism?

If $G$ is a finite abelian group and $p$ is a prime dividing $|G|$, then $G$ contains an element of order $p$. Proof: The proof proceeds by induction on $|G|$, namely, we assume the result is valid for every group whose order is strictly smaller than the order of $G$ and then prove the result valid for $G$ (this is sometimes referred to as complete induction).   Since $|G| > 1$, there is an element $x \in G$ with $x \neq 1$.   If $|G| = p$ then $x$ has order $p$ by Lagrange’s Theorem and we are done.   We may therefore assume $|G| > p$.
