I came up with a proof but I don't know if it's valid. Let $$J=\int_0^\pi \frac{xdx}{1+\sin x}.$$ On one hand, we have $$\frac1{1+\sin x}=\sum_{n\ge0}(-1)^n\sin(x)^n,$$ so that $$J=\sum_{n\ge0}(-1)^n p_n,\tag 2$$ where $$ \begin{align} p_n&=\int_0^\pi x\sin(x)^ndx\\ &=\int_\pi^0 -(\pi-x)\sin(\pi-x)^ndx\\ &=\pi\int_0^\pi\sin(x)^ndx-p_n\\ \Rightarrow p_n&=\frac\pi2\int_0^\pi\sin(x)^ndx. \end{align} $$ And since $\sin(x)=\sin(\pi-x)$ , $$p_n=\pi\int_0^{\pi/2}\sin(x)^ndx=\frac{\pi^{3/2}}{2}\frac{\Gamma(\tfrac{n+1}2)}{\Gamma(\tfrac{n}2+1)}.\tag 3$$ On the other hand, we have $1+\sin x=2\sin^2(\tfrac{x}2-\tfrac\pi4)$ , so that $$\begin{align} J&=\frac12\int_0^\pi\frac{xdx}{\sin^2(\tfrac{x}2-\tfrac\pi4)}\\ &=2\int_{\pi/4}^{3\pi/4}\frac{tdt}{\sin^2t}-\frac\pi2\int_{\pi/4}^{3\pi/4}\frac{dt}{\sin^2 t}\\ &=2\left(\ln\sin x-x\cot x\right)\bigg|_{\pi/4}^{3\pi/4}-\frac\pi2\left(-\cot x\right)\bigg|_{\pi/4}^{3\pi/4}\\ &=2\pi-\frac\pi2\cdot2=\pi. \end{align}$$ Then from $(2)$ and $(3)$ , we have $$\frac{\pi^{3/2}}{2}\sum_{n\ge0}(-1)^n\frac{\Gamma(\tfrac{n+1}2)}{\Gamma(\tfrac{n}2+1)}=\pi,$$ which is equivalent to $(1)$ . $\square$ Can you come up with any other proofs to $(1)$ ? Thanks! Edit (11/12/2020): Here is a proof that the interchange of the sum and integral in $(2)$ is valid. The partial sums $$S_M(x)=\sum_{n=0}^M(-1)^n\sin(x)^n$$ form a uniformly convergent sequence of functions for $x$ in $[0,\pi/2)$ or $(\pi/2,\pi]$ , and they converge to the limit $$\lim_{M\to\infty}S_M(x)=\frac1{1+\sin x},\qquad x\in[0,\pi]\setminus\{\pi/2\}.$$ Choose $\varepsilon>0$ and notice that $$J=\int_{0}^{\pi}\frac{xdx}{1+\sin x}=\int_{\pi/2-\varepsilon}^{\pi/2+\varepsilon}\frac{xdx}{1+\sin x}+\int_0^{\pi/2-\varepsilon}\frac{xdx}{1+\sin x}+\int_{\pi/2+\varepsilon}^\pi\frac{xdx}{1+\sin x}.$$ The sums $S_M(x)$ converge uniformly as $M\to\infty$ when $x\in[0,\pi/2-\varepsilon]\cup[\pi/2+\varepsilon,\pi]$ , so we can interchange the sum and integral to get $$J=\int_{\pi/2-\varepsilon}^{\pi/2+\varepsilon}\frac{xdx}{1+\sin x}+\sum_{n\ge0}(-1)^n(a_n(\pi/2-\varepsilon)+b_n(\pi/2+\varepsilon)),$$ where $$\begin{align} a_n(t)&=\int_0^t x\sin(x)^ndx\\ b_n(t)&=\int_t^\pi x\sin(x)^ndx. \end{align}$$ We have $a_n(t)+b_n(t)=p_n$ for all $t\in[0,\pi]$ . As $\varepsilon$ approaches $0$ , $\int_{\pi/2-\varepsilon}^{\pi/2+\varepsilon}\frac{xdx}{1+\sin x}$ approaches $0$ .

I've been trying to solve this problem for 3 days long - and it feels I tried everything. To conclude - I absolutely need the help of the professionals; And that's why I came here. I am given with the following function series: $$S(x)\equiv\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^nf_n(x)\equiv\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\FUNC{(-1)^n}$$ My task is to decide whether the series $S(x)$ uniformly converges on $[0,\infty)$ , or not. Things I tried: (1) I tried to use Leibniz's Alternating Series Test. I proved that $f_n(x)$ uniformly converges to $0$ , but the problem is that $f_n(x)$ is not a decreasing sequence - for every $n\in\mathbb{N}$ , there exists $0<x_0\in\mathbb{R}$ , such that $f_n(x)$ is increasing on $[0,x_0]$ , and decreasing on $[x_0,\infty)$ . I've noticed that $\lim_{n\to\infty}x_0=0$ , but that doesn't help - since it would never actually reach $0$ (that would only help to prove that the series uniformly converges on $[c,\infty)$ when $c>0$ ). (2) I tried to use Weierstrass's M Test. I found that $f_n(x)\leq\frac{1}{2n}$ for every $n\in\mathbb{N}$ , but that of course won't help (since $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2n}$ diverges). The huge problem using the M test is that $\frac{1}{2n}$ is actually a tight bound. (3) I proved that $\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\FUNC{}$ uniformly converges on $[c,\infty)$ when $c>0$ , but does not uniformly converges on $[0,\infty)$ . That wasn't very helpful, since $S(x)$ might converges conditionally. (4) Defining: $$S_m(x)\equiv\sum_{n=1}^{m}\FUNC{(-1)^n}$$ It is sufficient to show that: $$(*) \lim_{m\to\infty}\left(\sup_{[0,\infty)}\left|S_m(x)-S(x)\right|\right)\equiv\lim_{m\to\infty}\left(\sup_{[0,\infty)}\left|\sum_{n=m+1}^{\infty}\FUNC{(-1)^n}\right|\right)=0$$ in order to prove the series uniformly converges on $[0,\infty).$ Looks impossible and complicated - yet I was eager to try that too. But to no avail. I will say that my intuition is that the series does uniformly converge on $[0,\infty)$ , and that is because I used graphic calculators, and found that for every $n\in\mathbb{N}$ : $$\sup_{[0,\infty)}\left|\sum_{n=m+1}^{\infty}\FUNC{(-1)^n}\right|\leq\sum_{n=m+1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^2}$$ And since $\displaystyle \sum_{n=m+1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^2}$ converges, we can say that its limit when $m\to\infty$ is $0$ , thus proving $(*)$ . However - I couldn't prove this inequality. I tried using the triangle inequality, to distinguish between odd and even indices - nothing worked. As you might see - I really need help.

For instance, consider the function $f(x) = \frac{1}{2} x^2$ The derivative is $f'(x) = st \left( \frac{\frac{1}{2}(x + \epsilon)^2 - \frac{1}{2}x^2}{\epsilon} \right)$ for some infinitesimal $\epsilon$. This works out to $f'(x) = st(x + \frac{\epsilon}{2}) = st(x)$ So the derivative of $\frac{1}{2} x^2$ is the standard part function. Is this correct? I was expecting the derivative to be $f'(x) = x$ instead. $st(x)$ doesn't even have the same domain as the original function. Or am I misunderstanding something?",,"['calculus', 'derivatives', 'nonstandard-analysis', 'infinitesimals']"

Then I computed the Hessian matrix : H(x,y)= $$         \begin{pmatrix}         12x^2-48x   &  & 0 \\         0&  & 12y^2-36 \\         \\         \end{pmatrix} $$  To find the nature of critical points I computed the Hassian matrix at each critical point.

My teacher posted solutions, but I don't quite understand it. Does anyone know how this can be solved using trig substitution? The answer is $2/15$. Much thanks, Zolani13","$$\int_0^1x^3\sqrt{1 - x^2}dx$$ I need to find the integral of this function using trigonometric substitution. Using triangles, I found that $x = \sin\theta$, and $dx = \cos\theta d\theta$; so I have $$\int_0^{\pi/2}\sin^3\theta\sqrt{1 - \sin^2\theta}\cos\theta d\theta$$ then, using identities: $$\int_0^{\pi/2}\sin^3\theta\sqrt{\cos^2\theta}\cos\theta d\theta$$ $$\int_0^{\pi/2}\sin^3\theta\cos^2\theta d\theta$$ After this point, I don't know where to go.
