0,Least value of a multi-residue CRT,Least value of a multi-residue CRT,,"Given coprime moduli $m_1,\ldots,m_n$ with $k\ge2$ residues in each modulus, what is the least nonnegative value congruent to one of the specified residues to each modulus? Obviously it must be less than $M=m_1m_2\cdots m_n$, but it seems like it should be closer to $k^{-n}M.$ Can anything along these lines be proved, perhaps with additional assumptions on the residue classes or moduli? I'm interested in problems where storing $k^n$ residues would be memory-prohibitive and looping through each of the $k^n$ solutions would be too time-consuming. I'm hoping for some nice asymptotic result but an algorithm for computing this efficiently would be welcome as well. (The assumption that the number of residue classes for each modulus is fixed is not essential; the generalization with $k_i\ge2$ residue classes to modulus $m_i$ would be interesting as well.) Example: Find a number which is {0, 1} mod 3, {2, 4} mod 5, and {1, 3} mod 7. Clearly you can find a number smaller than 105 by taking any residue class for each modulus and CRTing them together. The possible residue classes are {22, 24, 52, 57, 64, 87, 94, 99} mod 105, so 22 is the least value.","Given coprime moduli $m_1,\ldots,m_n$ with $k\ge2$ residues in each modulus, what is the least nonnegative value congruent to one of the specified residues to each modulus?

Apparently if $n=2k+1$ is odd, then there are eight residue classes mod $5^{n+1}$ such that $v_5(|\PSL(5,q)|) = n$.  The residue classes seem to have some structure, but I'm having trouble seeing what it is. Here is the early data: k | residues of $q$ mod $5^{2k+2}$ such that $v_5(|\PSL(5,q)|) = 2k+1$ 0 | 2, 3, 8, 12, 13, 17, 22, 23 1 | 57, 68, 193, 307, 318, 432, 557, 568 2 | 2057, 4193, 5182, 7318, 8307, 10443, 11432, 13568 3 | 32318, 45807, 123932, 188568, 202057, 266693, 344818, 358307 4 | 280182, 1672943, 2233307, 4186432, 5579193, 7532318, 8092682, 9485443 For number theorists, we need to solve: $$v_5(q^2-1) + v_5(q^3-1) + v_5(q^4-1) + v_5(q^5-1) - \min(1,v_5(q-1)) = n$$ for $q \mod 5^{n+2}$ but apparently this is too many cases for me. I'd be interested in a formula for even one of the eight classes, as I think the others will follow .  If this is trivial, I'd also be interested in hearing why the even case is so different (and erratic).",,"['number-theory', 'group-theory']"

I'm not quite sure how to approach the problem as this doesn't seem to look like anything I had in my number theory course so far (or perhaps I missed this particular lecture). In similar problems where the exponents are not that high, I generally can look for solutions mod n for some small n natural, so that's where I decided to start. I started looking for solutions for each component of this equation in mod 2. Basically, 12x is always congruent to 0 mod 2. $x^{13}$ is congruent to 0 mod 2 when x is even, and congruent to 1 otherwise. $13y^6$ is congruent to 0 mod 2 when y is even, and congruent to 1 otherwise. However, all I could conclude is that there can be no integer solutions when both x and y are even, or when both x and y are odd. It looks like when x is even and y is odd (or vice-versa) there could be a solution and I can't show otherwise... Perhaps I started it all wrong, but that's all I could come up with so far.
