Here is my proof of Statement 1 by use of Statement 2. Let $G$ be as in Statement 1 . Note it additively. For every nonzero element $x$ of $G$ , $\mathbb{Z}x$ is a nontrivial subgroup of $G$ , thus, by hypothesis, (1) the quotient $G/ \mathbb{Z}x$ is finite. Thus, since $G$ is infinite by hypothesis, $\mathbb{Z}x$ is infinite. Since this is true for every nonzero element $x$ of $G$ , (2) $G$ is torsion-free. Choose a nonzero element $x$ of $G$ (it is possible, since $G$ is infinite by hypothesis). By (1), there exists a finite set $\{a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n} \}$ of elements of $G$ such that $a_{1} + \mathbb{Z}x, \ldots , a_{n} + \mathbb{Z}x$ are all the elements of $G/ \mathbb{Z}x$ . Thus $G$ is generated by $x, a_{1}, \ldots, a_{n}$ , thus $G$ is finitely generated, thus, by Statement 2, (3) $G$ is a direct sum $H_{1} \oplus \cdots \oplus H_{k}$ of finitely many nontrivial cyclic subgroups. Since $G$ is nontrivial, we have $k \geq 1$ . By (2), $G$ is torsion-free, thus every $H_{i}$ is torsion-free. Thus, since $H_{i}$ is nontrivial, (4) every $H_{i}$ is infinite. Since $H_{1}$ is not trivial, $G / H_{1}$ is finite (by hypothesis of the exercice). But, by (3), $G / H_{1}$ is isomorphic to $H_{2} \oplus \cdots \oplus H_{k}$ , thus $H_{2} \oplus \cdots \oplus H_{k}$ is finite. Thus, in view of (4), $k = 1$ , thus, by (3), $G = H_{1}$ . Thus, by (3), $G$ is (infinite) cyclic and we are done. Edit (January 15, 2022). If I am not wrong, the proof of satement 1 can easily be extracted from Robinson's proof of statement 2. Let $G$ be as in statement 1. As noted, $G$ is torsion-free. Since $G$ is infinite, we can choose a nonzero element $a$ of $G$ . Then $<a>$ is a nontrivial subgroup of $G$ , thus, by hypothesis, $<a>$ is of finite index $m > 0$ in $G$ . Then $x \mapsto mx$ defines a homomorphism from $G$ to $<a>$ .

I would like to prove that $$\mathbb C[C_7]\cong\bigoplus_{i=1}^7\mathbb C.$$ I was thinking that I could use the following theorem: If $R$ is a commutative unital ring and $\{e_i\}_{i=1}^n$ are orthogonal idempotents in $R$, such that $\sum_{i=1}^ne_i=1,$  then $$R\cong\bigoplus_{i=1}^ne_iR.$$ That would mean I have to find seven orthogonal idempotents $\{e_i\}_{i=1}^7$ with $$e_1+e_2+e_3+e_4+e_5+e_6+e_7=1,$$ such that $e_i R\cong \mathbb C.$ Is this the right way to do it? I've managed to find one idempotent $e\in R$ such that $eR = e\mathbb C.$ That is, I take $$e=\frac 17 (1+g+\cdots+g^6).$$ I have $$e^2=\frac 17 \cdot \frac 17(1+g+\cdots+g^6)(1+g+\cdots+g^6)=\frac 17\cdot \frac 17\cdot 7(1+g+\cdots+g^6)=e,$$ so $e$ is idempotent. For $\sum_{i=0}^6 r_ig^i\in R$, I have $$ \begin{eqnarray} e\sum_{i=0}^6 r_ig^i&=&\frac 17(1+g+\cdots+g^6)(r_0+r_1g+\cdots+r_6g^6)\\ &=&\frac 17(r_0+r_1g+\cdots+r_6g^6\\ &\,& \;\;\,+r_6+r_0g+\cdots+r_5g^6 \\ &\,& \;\;\,\vdots\\ &\,& \;\;\,+r_1+r_2g+\cdots+r_0g^6)\\ &=&e\sum_{i=0}^6 r_i\in e\mathbb C, \end{eqnarray} $$ (where $\mathbb C$ denotes the natural copy of the field $\mathbb C$ contained in $R$). Every element of $e\mathbb C$ can be written as $e\sum_{i=0}^6 r_i$, so $eR=e\mathbb C.$ But I need $eR\cong \mathbb C.$ $e\mathbb C$ is not isomorphic to $\mathbb C,$ is it? The former doesn't have a unity, right? But even if I'm missing something very simple here and $eR\cong \mathbb C,$ then I still don't have seven idempotents -- just the one.

Show that $G$ is necessarily abelian. While trying to do this exercise I noticed two facts. First, $g$ and $f(g)$ have the same order because $o(f(g))|o(g)$ and, applying $f$ again and using $f^2=\text{id}_G$, $o(f(f(g)))=o(g)|o(f(g))$ and, once the order of any element is $\geq 1$, it follows that $o(g)=o(f(g))$. Also, it's easy to see that $g$ and $f(g)$ commute. Second, there cannot exist such an automorphism if the order of $G$ is even, because $f(e)=e$ and we can form pairs like $\{g,f(g)\}$ with $f(g)\neq g$ that are invariant under $f$, i.e., $f(\{g,f(g)\})=\{g,f(g)\}$. But once the order of $G$ is even, proceeding with the construction of the pairs, we'll end up with just one element $\neq e$, so we must have some $\gamma\in G\setminus{e}$ with $f(\gamma)=\gamma$, contradicting the hypothesis.
