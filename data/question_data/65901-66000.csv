11,Induction does not preserve ordering between cardinality of sets?,Induction does not preserve ordering between cardinality of sets?,,"Consider building a binary tree and consider it as a collection of points and edges. Here is one with five levels, numbered level $1$ at the top with $1$ node to level $5$ at the bottom with $16$ nodes. Imagine building this in stages by level. Level one has $1$ node and $1$ path. Level $2$ adds an additional $2$ nodes for a total of $3$ nodes in the structure, but of course there are only $2$ paths (through the full tree). I will always consider a path as that which traverses level $1$ to level $n$ . So at level $n$ we have a total of $2^n-1$ nodes (in the entire tree), but the number of paths is only $2^{n-1}$ . Thus, at each stage of construction, we have strictly fewer paths than the total number of nodes in the tree. Of course, the number of paths at level $n$ is exactly the number of nodes at that particular level. If we allow ourselves to iterate this as $n$ ranges over all of $\mathbb N$ , we end up with an uncountably infinite number of paths. This feels counterintuitive and paradoxical. I am sure there is a standard explanation for why this iterative process does not respect the ordering between the number of nodes and paths. So my question is: what is the explanation for this phenomenon? More generally, I welcome any insight into how to think about this too and especially pointing out the errors in my thinking. It seems like the principle is that induction does not preserve order relations between cardinality of sets (or of sequences of sets more precisely). E.g. let $(A_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$ and $(B_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$ be sequences of sets such that their cardinalities are always ordered $|A_n|\leq|B_n|$ for all $n\in\mathbb N$ . Assume that "" $\lim_{n\to\infty}A_n=A$ "" and "" $\lim_{n\to\infty}B_n=B$ "" exist in some appropriate sense. Then we can have $|A|>|B|$ . (I'm not sure how to make the idea rigorous in the tree example. I've only really seen such a limit defined for nested sequences of sets.) One other thought is that I am mixing the concept of natural numbers and cardinal numbers. Thinking about these as sequences of natural numbers, they don't converge as they are just unbounded as the tree grows. But as sequences of cardinal numbers, they do sort of ""converge"" in some sense, to $\aleph_0$ and $2^{\aleph_0}$ (assuming these are the appropriate symbols here, correct me if I'm wrong.). But I don't think my standard real analysis-style of thinking applies in this situation.

I will always consider a path as that which traverses level to level . So at level we have a total of nodes (in the entire tree), but the number of paths is only . Thus, at each stage of construction, we have strictly fewer paths than the total number of nodes in the tree. Of course, the number of paths at level is exactly the number of nodes at that particular level. If we allow ourselves to iterate this as ranges over all of , we end up with an uncountably infinite number of paths. This feels counterintuitive and paradoxical. I am sure there is a standard explanation for why this iterative process does not respect the ordering between the number of nodes and paths. So my question is: what is the explanation for this phenomenon? More generally, I welcome any insight into how to think about this too and especially pointing out the errors in my thinking. It seems like the principle is that induction does not preserve order relations between cardinality of sets (or of sequences of sets more precisely). E.g. let and be sequences of sets such that their cardinalities are always ordered for all . Assume that "" "" and "" "" exist in some appropriate sense. Then we can have . (I'm not sure how to make the idea rigorous in the tree example. I've only really seen such a limit defined for nested sequences of sets.) One other thought is that I am mixing the concept of natural numbers and cardinal numbers. Thinking about these as sequences of natural numbers, they don't converge as they are just unbounded as the tree grows. But as sequences of cardinal numbers, they do sort of ""converge"" in some sense, to and (assuming these are the appropriate symbols here, correct me if I'm wrong.). But I don't think my standard real analysis-style of thinking applies in this situation. I'm probably just naively thinking about the relevant set-theoretic issues here...",1 1 5 16 1 1 2 2 3 2 1 n n 2^n-1 2^{n-1} n n \mathbb N (A_n)_{n\in\mathbb N} (B_n)_{n\in\mathbb N} |A_n|\leq|B_n| n\in\mathbb N \lim_{n\to\infty}A_n=A \lim_{n\to\infty}B_n=B |A|>|B| \aleph_0 2^{\aleph_0},"['combinatorics', 'set-theory', 'order-theory', 'cardinals', 'trees']"

14,Dice probabilities and stars/bars,Dice probabilities and stars/bars,,"I'm trying to apply stars and bars to answer a dice question: if $n$ players throw $k$ -sided dice, what is the probability that exactly $i$ players throw a unique number (where $0 \leq i \leq n$ )? For example, if $4$ players throw $4$ -sided dice, and three throw a $3$ , and one throws a $4$ , then $1$ player threw a unique number.  If two throw a $1$ and two throw a $3$ , then $0$ players threw a unique number. This is easy to enumerate and count for small $n$ and $k$ :  for $4$ players throwing $4$ sided dice, then we have $4^4$ (or $k^n$ total outcomes), with the following probabilities: $$ P_0 = \frac{40}{256}, \, P_1 = \frac{48}{256},\, P_2 = \frac{144}{256},\, P_3 = \frac{0}{256},\, P_4 = \frac{24}{256},$$ where $P_i$ means the probability of exactly $i$ players throwing a unique number. I was thinking this could be calculated with a stars-and-bars formulation, where we partition $n$ players into $k$ equally likely bins (each bin is a side of the dice).  So a partition $[0,0,0,4]$ means all $4$ players threw a $4$ , and $[1,1,1,1]$ means each player threw a different number (one player threw a $1$ , the next threw a $2$ , etc). There would be $n \choose k$ or ${4+4-1} \choose {4-1}$ = $7 \choose 3$ = $35$ different partitions of $4$ players into $4$ dice-side bins.

24,How many sets of non-adjacent edges in the 600-cell?,How many sets of non-adjacent edges in the 600-cell?,,"(This is a simpler variant of my previous question, with one colour instead of two.) The 600-cell is a 4D regular polytope. It has $120$ vertices, $720$ edges, $1200$ triangular faces, and $600$ tetrahedral cells. Each vertex touches $12$ edges, in an icosahedral arrangement. Two edges are adjacent if they're part of one triangular face. The number of adjacent pairs of edges is $1200\times\binom{3}{2}=3600$ . Question 1: How many subsets (of that set of $720$ edges) have no adjacent pairs of edges? Question 2: How many of these are distinct, considering symmetries of the 600-cell? An obvious upper bound for these numbers is the total number of subsets, $2^{720}\approx5.515\times10^{216}$ . The rectified 600-cell is a 4D uniform polytope, whose vertices correspond to the edges of the 600-cell, with the same adjacency relations. It has $720$ vertices and $3600$ edges. Each vertex touches $10$ edges. So I may equivalently ask about sets of non-adjacent vertices in the rectified 600-cell: Question 1: How many vertex-induced subgraphs (of the rectified 600-cell's graph) have no edges? Question 2: How many of these are distinct, considering symmetries of the rectified 600-cell? An approximate answer would still be appreciated. Let $A_1$ and $A_2$ be the answers to the two questions (respectively). The order of the 600-cell's symmetry group is $600\times24=14400$ , where the $24$ is from tetrahedral symmetry. Thus, for each subset, there are between $1$ and $14400$ subsets in its orbit under the symmetry group. As $A_1$ counts the subsets and $A_2$ counts the orbits, we get $$A_2\leq A_1\leq14400A_2.$$ In fact, it seems very likely that a random subset would have no symmetry; all $14400$ subsets in its orbit would be unequal to each other. So I'm expecting $$A_1\approx14400A_2.$$ And I think $A_2$ would be more difficult to compute than $A_1$ .

We start at the origin and each second we move by one unit either up, down, left or right with equal probability (equal to $1/4$ ). Suppose there is a square surrounding the origin of the plane, centered at $(0,0)$ and whose sides have length $L=4$ , i.e. the vertices of the square are located at the four points $(\pm 2,\pm 2)$ . Question : what is the expected time required to hit the square? Now, we can get an approximation of the expected time by computing the RMS distance, which is given by $$\sqrt{E(D_N^2)} = \sqrt{N}$$ where $D_N$ is the distance from the origin after $N$ seconds. However, this is obviously not the same as the expected distance itself, which would be $E(|D_N|)$ . I know that the latter can be at least computed asymptotically (i.e. when $N\rightarrow \infty$ ), but for the problem in question we expect $N\sim 4$ , which is clearly much smaller than infinity, so I would like to find a more accurate value (if possible!). I have tried using the results from 1.4.2 in this reference , but I am stuck trying to compute $p_n(x,y;A)$ , i.e. the probability of being at point $y$ at time $n$ when starting from point $x$ , where $x,y \in A$ .

Clearly we must have $p_n(0,0;A)\le p_n(0,0)$ since some paths are not allowed anymore, but I'm not sure how to compute it exactly.

I am aware that there are other questions with solutions to this question, however I am asking again as there seem to be conflicting answers online. Some say $384$ whilst some say $288$ . I make my solution to be 384, as I see that there are $4!$ ways of enumerating the first (top left) $2\times2$ block, and then there are $2!$ ways of enumerating the remaining cells of each of the first column, second column, first row and second row. Once the first block and the adjacent blocks (blocks two and three, if you will) are fully enumerated, the fourth block (bottom right) can only be enumerated in one way due to the restrictions on number placement caused by the enumeration of blocks 2 (top right) and 3 (bottom left). From this, I therefore make my total number of possible enumerations to be: $$4!\times2!\times2!\times2!\times2!=384.$$ It is clear that quite a few others have calculated it in a slightly different way and made their solution to be 288. This doesn't make sense to me as it seems that the total should be divisible by 8, as the any given enumerated grid should have 8 symmetries (rotations and flips) which are all equally valid sudoku enumerations. Is my calculation incorrect or are some of the answers online incorrect? Edit: I made a typo initially and wrote 388 instead of 288.

( Edit: Even if there are already two great answers, I would love to have a couple more answers.  Especially, I would like to see another, hopefully more combinatorial, proof of the bonus question below.) Question. Let $x$ and $y$ be noncommuting variables such that $x^2=y^2=1$ .  Multiplication is associative.  Prove that, for each positive integer $n$ , there are exactly $\displaystyle\binom{2n}{n}$ expressions of length $2n$ in $x$ and $y$ that are equal to $1$ .  For example, when $n=1$ , there are $2$ such expressions: $xx$ and $yy$ .  When $n=2$ , there are $6$ such expressions: $xxxx$ , $xxyy$ , $xyyx$ , $yxxy$ , $yyxx$ , and $yyyy$ . For a technical clarification, consider the free product $G:=C_2*C_2$ , where $C_2$ is the cyclic group of order $2$ .  Then, $G$ has the following presentation: $G=\langle x,y\,|\,x^2=y^2=1\rangle$ .  We want to find the number of strings of length $2n$ formed by $x$ and $y$ that can be reduced to $1$ . I would like to see how to prove this statement using a combinatorial argument, such as constructing a bijection, finding a generating function, etc.  However, any proof that is different from the proofs below is welcome.  (If you can visit the referred link and give it a combinatorial proof, that would be most appreciated.) Bonus. Let $s$ be a reduced word in $x$ and $y$ (that is, it can no longer be reduced using the rules $x^2=y^2=1$ ).  If $s$ has length $k$ , then show that, for any integer $n\geq 0$ , there are exactly $\displaystyle\binom{n+2k}{n}$ words in $x$ and $y$ of length $k+2n$ that can be reduced to $s$ . Elementary Proof We work in $R:=\mathbb{Z}[x,y]$ .  Note that $$x+y=x+xxy=x(1+xy)$$ and $$(x+y)^2=\big(x(1+xy)\big)^2=x(1+xy)\,x(1+xy)\,.$$ Because $$(1+xy)x=x+xyx=x(1+yx)\,,$$ we have $$(x+y)^2=xx(1+yx)(1+xy)=yx(1+xy)^2=(xy)^{-1}(1+xy)^2\,.$$ Therefore, $$(x+y)^{2n}=\Big((xy)^{-1}(1+xy)^2\Big)^n=(xy)^{-n}(1+xy)^{2n}\,.$$ Thus, there are $\displaystyle\binom{2n}{n}$ expressions of length $2n$ that are equal to $1$ . Algebraic Proof Here is another approach borrowing the idea from Julian Rosen .  Let $R$ denote the unital $\mathbb{Z}$ -algebra generated by $x$ and $y$ (i.e. $R=\mathbb{Z}[G]$ ).  Then, the $\mathbb{Z}$ -algebra homomorphism $$\varphi:R\to\text{Mat}_{2\times2}\big(\mathbb{Z}[t,t^{-1}]\big)$$ defined by sending $$x\mapsto\begin{bmatrix}0&1\\1&0\end{bmatrix}\text{ and }y\mapsto\begin{bmatrix}0&t^{-1}\\t&0\end{bmatrix}$$ is injective.  We can easily see that $$\varphi\big((x+y)^2\big)=t^{-1}(1+t)^2\,I\,,$$ where $I$ is the $2$ -by- $2$ identity matrix.  Hence, $$\varphi\big((x+y)^{2n}\big)=t^{-n}(1+t)^{2n}\,I\,,$$ and the assertion follows immediately. Geometric Proof Using the notations from the geometric proof in my answer here , recall that $x=\sigma_\alpha$ and $y=\sigma_\beta$ .  Thus, $$(x+y)^2=2+\sigma_\alpha\sigma_\beta+\sigma_\beta\sigma_\alpha=2+\rho_{2\alpha-2\beta}+\rho_{2\beta-2\alpha}\,.$$ (It can also be proven that $$\sigma_{\theta_1}+\sigma_{\theta_2}=2\,\cos(\theta_1-\theta_2)\,\sigma_{\frac{\theta_1+\theta_2}{2}}$$ for all $\theta_1,\theta_2\in\mathbb{R}$ .)  Note that $$\rho_{+\theta}+\rho_{-\theta}=2\,\cos(\theta)$$ for all $\theta\in\mathbb{R}$ .  Hence, $$(x+y)^2=2\,\big(1+\cos(2\alpha-2\beta)\big)=2^2\,\big(\cos(\alpha-\beta)\big)^2\,.$$ Then, the number of expressions of length $2n$ that are equal to $1$ is given by $$\begin{align}\frac{1}{(2\pi)^2}\,\int_0^{2\pi}\,\int_0^{2\pi}\,(x+y)^{2n}\,\text{d}\beta\,\text{d}\alpha&=\frac{1}{(2\pi)^2}\,\int_0^{2\pi}\,\int_0^{2\pi}\,2^{2n}\,\big(\cos(\alpha-\beta)\big)^{2n}\,\text{d}\beta\,\text{d}\alpha \\&=\frac{1}{(2\pi)^2}\,2^{2n}\,\frac{\pi}{2^{2n-1}}\,\binom{2n}{n}\,(2\pi)=\binom{2n}{n}\,. \end{align}$$","This question is motivated by this link .

From creating a list of all permutations, labelling them man/women and searching for three adjacent men i know however that the answer must be 2304. That means my approach above is double counting some of them.

(Project Euler #106),,"I've already asked this question before, but then I realized that wording was, unfortunately, quite confusing. The statement of the problem is following: Let $S(A)$ represent the sum of elements in set A of size n. We shall call it a special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint subsets, $B$ and $C$ , the following properties are true: $1.$ $S(B) ≠ S(C$ ); that is, sums of subsets cannot be equal. $2.$ If B contains more elements than $C$ then $S(B) > S(C)$ . For this problem we shall assume that a given set contains n strictly increasing elements and it already satisfies the second rule. Surprisingly, out of the 25 possible subset pairs that can be obtained from a set for which $n = 4$ , only 1 of these pairs need to be tested for equality (first rule). Similarly, when $n = 7$ , only 70 out of the $966$ subset pairs need to be tested. For $n = 12$ , how many of the $261625$ subset pairs that can be obtained need to be tested for equality? Problem statement specifies that, if size of subset $B$ doesn't equal to the size of the subset $C$ , then theirs sums will not be equal by default. So when testing set $A$ for the equality, we only consider subsets with the same size. The main question is, for arbitrary set $A$ with size $n$ which satisfies conditions specified in the problem, how many pairs of subsets with the same size are needed to be tested? I couldn't have come up with purely mathematical solution myself, so I checked answers provided by the users in the discussion thread. A lot of them mentioned so called ""grid method"", for example, one of the posts: First, some observations. If elements of the set are assigned in ascending order to subset $B$ , subset $C$ , or discarded, and every element of $B$ can be paired with an element of $C$ that was selected later, then B's sum will be smaller than $C$ 's, and the comparison will not be necessary. If you imagine a walk on a grid from upper left to lower right, where selecting an element for subset $B$ is like walking East, and selecting an element for subset $C$ is like walking South, and selecting an element for neither subset is effectively the same as selecting it for both (East, then South), then a walk that crosses the diagonal from north to south (with this direction being the first diagonal crossing) corresponds exactly to a subset pair that must be compared. And one more Clearly we only need to test equal size groups $(k)$ . If we select $2k$ elements, we only need to test some partition of that into $2k$ -size groups if there is an $m$ -smallest number in the group with the smallest element that is bigger than the $m$ -smallest number in the other group. This can be modeled as a path across a $k×k$ grid that crosses the diagonal , so we can use Catalan numbers $C_k$ (which count paths that don't cross the diagonal) and half the total number of paths across the grid to get the number of diagonal-crossing paths (half = given start direction).Then the selection of the initial $2k$ set is a binomial coefficient, and sum across values of $k$ .
