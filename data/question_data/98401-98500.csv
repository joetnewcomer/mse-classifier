0,Showing pre-image under entire function is simply connected.,Showing pre-image under entire function is simply connected.,,"I am currently working on the following problem and have run into a bit of trouble: Consider an entire function $f$ s.t. $\overline{B_1(0)}\subset f(\mathbb{C}).$   Show that V, a component of $f^{-1}(B_1(0)),$ is simply connected. I figure the best way to achieve this result was by showing that any two curves with the same endpoints are homotopic. So I considered two parametrized closed curves $\gamma(t)$ and $\kappa(t)$ where $t\in[0,1]$ s.t. $$\gamma(0)=a=\kappa(0) \ \textrm{  and  } \ \gamma(1)=b=\kappa(1).$$  Now $f(\gamma(t))$ and $f(\kappa(t))$ are parameterizations of closed curves joining the points $f(a)$ and $f(b).$ Now we can deform these to one another via the family of functions $$d_s(t)=(1-s)f(\gamma(t))+sf(\kappa(t)), \textrm{ where} \ s\in[0,1].$$ The problem is from here I have no where to go, because I am not guaranteed anything about $f^{-1}(d_s(t))$ since I only have that $f$ is entire. In an effort to fix this I thought I could apply the inverse function theorem to get some local inverses, but I still don't believe I have enough information to obtain the result I want. After this didn't pan out, I thought maybe I could show that the integral over any closed curve in $V$ with respect to $f(z)$ was 0, but I haven't had any luck with that either. I know that there are several equivalencies to the statement ''V is simply connected,'' but I don't see how the others would work out in this case. I also saw on one website a comment that said this follows from the Maximum Modulus Principle, but I don't see how. Any helpful hints are appreciated. Thanks Note: I was also wondering if a component needs to be connected, because if not I don't see how the case of $f$ being constant would work. Progress Update: So I may have gotten a tad closer to the solution. I know that $f'$ can only have countably many isolated singularities (otherwise it would be 0 implying $f\equiv0$). So choose $z_0\in V\setminus Z[f']$ and use the inverse function theorem to guarantee that $f$ is invertible in a small neighborhood, and so this neighborhood would be simply connected. Since we have this for every point except those in $Z[f']$ I feel like it would give us the result.","I am currently working on the following problem and have run into a bit of trouble: Consider an entire function $f$ s.t. $\overline{B_1(0)}\subset f(\mathbb{C}).$   Show that V, a component of $f^{-1}(B_1(0)),$ is simply connected.

But since $1$ and $-1$ are symmetric points w.r.t. the imaginary axis, the Mobius transformations always maps symmetric points to symmetric points.  So, the images, $0$ and $\infty$, being symmetric points, must mean that they are symmetric with respect to a circle.  So the real axis gets mapped to some circle centered at the origin. How do I tell how big this circle is?  And since the real axis separates the upper and lower half planes, either the upper or lower plane gets mapped inside the circle, but how can I tell? I tried a sample point:  I see that $i$ gets mapped to $i$, but is this telling me that the mapping is ""fixing"" the UHP?  I doubt it, because it's mapping stuff to some open disk.

Show that $z\in\mathbb{R}^{+}$. If $z=a+bi$, $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$, then for $n=1\Rightarrow Re(z)\geq0\Rightarrow a\geq0$. So $a\in\mathbb{R}^{+}$, now we only need show that $b=0$. $n=2$ $Re(z^{2})=a^{2}-b^{2}\geq0\Rightarrow a^{2}\geq b^{2}\Rightarrow a\geq|b|.$ $n=3$ $Re(z^{3})=a^{3}-3ab^{2}\geq0\Rightarrow\frac{a}{\sqrt{3}}\geq|b|.$ $n=4$ $Re(z^{4})=a^{4}-6a^{2}b^{2}+b^{4}\geq0\Rightarrow(a^{2}-3b^{2})^{2}-8b^{4}\geq0\Rightarrow\frac{a}{\sqrt{\sqrt{8}+3}}\geq|b|.$ $\vdots$ In this way I think we can make a sequence $(a_{n})_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ such that $a_{n}\geq|b|, \forall n\in\mathbb{N}$ and $a_{n}\longrightarrow0$ when $n\longrightarrow\infty$, so by the Squeeze theorem $|b|=0\Rightarrow b=0$. Is that right(Can anyone give me some hints on how to find this sequence?)? Or I can show what I want in an easier way? Thanks! Alec: $z=\rho e^{i\theta}=\rho(\cos(\theta)+i\sin(\theta))\Rightarrow z^{n}=e^{in\theta}=\rho^{n}(\cos(n\theta)+i\sin(n\theta)).$ Suppose the number has ANY imaginary component, i.e.,  $\sin(\theta)\neq0\Rightarrow\theta\neq k\pi,\forall k\in\mathbb{Z}$. You are saying that for some $n_{0}\in\mathbb{N}$ we'll have: $\cos(n_{0}\theta)<0$. Like this: For $0<\theta<\frac{\pi}{2}$ then take $\frac{\pi}{2\theta}<n_{0}<1+\frac{\pi}{2\theta}$, so $0<\theta<\frac{\pi}{2}<n_{0}\theta<\theta+\frac{\pi}{2}<\pi$.

I came across this problem in a set of notes. I am given a complex-valued continuous function $h(t)$ on $[0,1]$. Then the function $H(z)$ is defined as follows: $$H(z) = \int_0^1 \dfrac{h(t)}{t-z} dt $$ I am supposed to show that $H(z)$ is analytic on $\mathbb{C}-[0,1]$ and get its derivative. I got the latter through first principles i.e. by simply evaluating the limit $$ \dfrac{1}{\Delta z} [H(z +\Delta z) - H(z)]$$ However the hint says I should use uniform convergence of integrals to show analyticity.This I dont get. I do not wish to use Cauchy's or Morera's theorem or any of the related ilk. Am I supposed to approximate $h(t)$ which is continuous on a compact set by polynomials by invoking the Weierstrass theorem??Please help.",,['complex-analysis']
