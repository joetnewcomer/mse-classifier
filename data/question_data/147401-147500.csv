Proof: Assume for contradiction, that there exist integers $p$ and $q$ satisfying (1) $\left(\frac{p}{q}\right)^2 = 2$. We may also assume that $p$ and $q$ have no common factor, because, if they had one, we could simply cancel it out and rewrite the fraction in lowest terms. Now, equation (1) implies (2) $p^2 = 2q^2$. From this we can see that the integer $p^2$ is an even number (it is divisible by 2), and hence $p$ must be even as well because the square of an odd number is odd. This allows us to write $p=2r$, where $r$ is also an integer. If we substitute $2r$ for $p$ in equation (2), then a little algebra yields the relationship $2r^2=q^2$. This last equation implies that $q^2$ is even, and hence $q$ must also be even. Thus, we have shown that $p$ and $q$ are both even (i.e., divisible by $2$) when they were originally assumed to have no common factor. From this logical impasse, we can only conclude that equation (1) cannot hold for any integers $p$ and $q$, and thus the theorem is proved. Exercise: (a) Prove that $\sqrt{3}$ is irrational. Does a similar argument work to show that $\sqrt{6}$ is irrational? (b) Where does the proof of the irrationality of $\sqrt{2}$ break down if we try to use it to prove $\sqrt{4}$ is irrational? Solution: (a) Assume, for contradiction, that there exist integers $p$ and $q$ satisfying (1) $\left(\frac{p}{q}\right)^2 = 3$. Let us also assume that $p$ and $q$ have no common factor. Now, equation (1) implies (2) $p^2 = 3q^2$. From this, we can see that $p^2$ is a multiple of $3$ and hence $p$ must also be a multiple of $3$. This allows us to write $p = 3r$, where $r$ is an integer. After substituting $3r$ for $p$ in equation (2), we get $(3r)^2 = 3q^2$, which can be simplified to $3r^2=q^2$. This implies $q^2$ is a multiple of $3$ and hence $q$ is also a multiple of $3$. Thus we have shown $p$ and $q$ have a common factor, namely $3$, when they were originally assumed to have no common factor.   A similar argument will work for $\sqrt{6}$ as well because we get $p^2 = 6q^2$ which implies $p$ is a multiple of $2$ and $3$. After making the necessary substitutions, we can conclude $q$ is a multiple of $6$, and therefore $\sqrt{6}$ must be irrational. (b) In this case, the fact that $p^2$ is a multiple of $4$ does not imply $p$ is also a multiple of $4$. Thus, our proof breaks down at this point. Question(s): Could somebody please help and spell out for me some of the theorems which are being used along the way in the arguments above? Since the theorem quoted above is the first theorem in the book, I am not exactly sure what is assumed to be common knowledge or whatever... For $\sqrt{3}$, what exactly is being used to justify ""$p^2$ is a multiple of $3$ and hence $p$ must also be a multiple of $3$""? I've seen some other proofs for this which have to do with even and odd numbers, but the one above has to do specifically with $3$, right?

Proof: Assume for contradiction, that there exist integers $p$ and $q$ satisfying (1) $\left(\frac{p}{q}\right)^2 = 2$. We may also assume that $p$ and $q$ have no common factor, because, if they had one, we could simply cancel it out and rewrite the fraction in lowest terms. Now, equation (1) implies (2) $p^2 = 2q^2$. From this we can see that the integer $p^2$ is an even number (it is divisible by 2), and hence $p$ must be even as well because the square of an odd number is odd. This allows us to write $p=2r$, where $r$ is also an integer. If we substitute $2r$ for $p$ in equation (2), then a little algebra yields the relationship $2r^2=q^2$.

This question came to me when I was thinking about real and complex differentiability, which we can define in a very similar manner: Let $\mathbb F\in\{\mathbb R,\mathbb C\}$ , and $V,W$ normed, finite dimensional vector spaces over $\mathbb F$ . Also let $f:V\to W$ . We call $f$ $\mathbb F$ -differentiable at $x_0\in V$ if there is an $\mathbb F$ -linear map $\mathrm Df_{x_0}:V\to W$ such that $$\lim_{x\to x_0}\frac{\Vert f(x)-f(x_0)-\mathrm Df_{x_0}(x-x_0)\Vert}{\Vert x-x_0\Vert}=0.$$ This gives us a very natural way to talk about the real or complex differentiability of a function $\mathbb C\to\mathbb C$ , for instance. Just consider $\mathbb C$ a two-dimensional vector space over $\mathbb R$ or a one-dimensional vector space over $\mathbb C$ . I'm wondering wether this can be generalized in an interesting way. This is my idea: We would need a generalization of a norm to general fields, and of course we would still need to work in complete spaces. Norms can be generalized using a valuation: Let $\mathbb F$ be a field. A valuation is a map $\vert\cdot\vert:\mathbb F\to\mathbb R$ satisfying the following for all $a,b\in\mathbb F$ : $\vert a\vert\geq0$ and $\vert a\vert=0$ iff $a=0$ . $\vert ab\vert=\vert a\vert\vert b\vert$ . $\vert a+b\vert\leq\vert a\vert+\vert b\vert$ .

A norm on $V$ induces a metric $\Vert x-y\Vert$ . We can now consider finite-dimensional, normed vector spaces $V,W$ over $F$ which are complete with respect to the induced metric, and are free to define: A function $f:V\to W$ is $\mathbb F$ -differentiable in $x_0\in V$ if there exists an $\mathbb F$ -linear map $\mathrm Df_{x_0}:V\to W$ such that $$\lim_{x\to x_0}\frac{\Vert f(x)-f(x_0)-\mathrm Df_{x_0}(x-x_0)\Vert}{\Vert x-x_0\Vert}=0.$$ Now the question is wether such a definition is actually interesting.

I would love to know if there are topics in analysis beyond these estimations and computations, so if you know of them please do tell me. Yes, something I missed is: why did I like analysis? Because it reduced a lot of computations I used to do as a high school student. Look at the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma. Look at the power of Stone-Weierstrass. These are theorems that really boost my interest. But then, what about the rest?",,"['analysis', 'soft-question']"

The lowest order terms are $$\Gamma(z,z) \sim z^{z-1}e^{-z} \left(\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}} z^{\frac{1}{2}} - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{\sqrt{2 \pi} }{24 z^{\frac{1}{2}}} + \ldots \right)$$ The digital library unfortunately cites no sources. Anybody has any idea how this was derived? I have tried to derive it with Laplace's approximation. In the integral that defines the incomplete $\Gamma$ , the maximum of the integrand is at $t=z-1$ while the lower limit of integration is $z$ . So the maximum lies outside the integration range. You must therefore approximate the integrand for small positive values of $t -z$ , and this gives something completely different from the digital-library formula. Moreover: the function I am really interested in is $\Gamma(z,z-a)$ , calculated for large $z$ . Here $a >1$ is a fixed real number, so the maximum is outside the integration range. But the Laplace method may not be sufficient because I need corrections from the $t=z-a$ too.

So I have tried to prove as follows. Please check whether it is right or wrong. Note that $AB$ is defined by $$AB=\{z\in\mathbb{R}\mid \exists x\in A, y\in B: z=xy\}.$$ In order to prove this theorem, we need the following lemma. Lemma $\quad $ Let $A$ and $B$ be nonempty sets of nonnegative real numbers. Suppose that $A$ and $B$  are bounded  above. Then     \begin{gather*} 		\sup AB=\sup A\cdot\sup B. 	\end{gather*} Proof. Let $A\subset [0,+\infty)$ and $B\subset [0,+\infty),$ and $A,B$ nonempty, bounded above.  Put $a=\sup A, b=\sup B, c=\sup AB.$ Since $A\subset [0,+\infty)$ and $B\subset [0,+\infty),$   we see that $0$ is a lower bound of both $A$ and $B,$ so $a, b, c$ are nonnegative.  Let $z\in AB.$ Then there are $x\in A, y\in B$ such that $z=xy.$  Since $0\leq x\leq a$ and $0\leq y\leq b,$ we have $xy\leq ab.$  So $z\leq ab.$ By arbitrariness of $z,$ we deduce that $ab$ is an upper bound  of $AB.$  Hence $c\leq ab.$   Note that $c\geq0.$  If $c<ab,$ then we have $a>0$ and $b>0.$ It follows that $\frac{c}{b}<a=\sup A.$  Hence there exists $x_1\in A$ such that $\frac{c}{b}<x_1.$  So $x_1>0.$ Then we deduce that $\frac{c}{x_1}<b=\sup B.$ So there exists $y_1\in B$ such that $\frac{c}{x_1}<y_1.$ From $x_1>0$ it follows that $c<x_1y_1.$  But $x_1y_1\in AB,$ so we have $\sup AB=c<x_1y_1\in AB,$ which is absurd.  Hence we have $c\geq ab.$ And thus we conclude that $\sup AB=c=ab=\sup A\cdot \sup B.$  $\qquad\Box$ Proof of the theorem. let $A$ and $B$ be bounded sets of real numbers. Put   \begin{gather*}  	a=\sup A, \quad a'=\inf A,\quad b=\sup B,\quad b'=\inf B, \quad c=\sup AB.  \end{gather*}   We shall prove that $c=\max\{ab,a'b,ab',a'b'\}.$   And we plan to prove this statement by cases. (i)   Case $a'\geq 0, b'\geq 0.$   Thus, for $x\in A$ and $y\in B,$ we have $a\geq x\geq a'\geq 0, b\geq y\geq b'\geq 0,$ so $A\subset [0,+\infty), B\subset [0,+\infty),$ and  $a'b\leq ab,  ab'\leq ab, a' b'\leq ab,$ which implies  that $\max\{ab,a'b,ab',a'b'\}=ab.$  By the above Lemma , we have $\sup AB=\sup A\cdot \sup B=ab.$ Hence in this case the desired equality $(\star)$ holds. (ii) $a'\geq 0, b'<0.$   In this case we have for all $x\in A,$  $x\geq a'\geq 0,$ and so $x\geq 0.$ We consider two sub-cases. (ii.1) $b>0.$  In this case $0\leq a'\leq a,  b'<0<b,$ so $a'b\leq ab, ab'\leq a'b'\leq 0\leq ab,$ which gives that   $\max\{ab,a'b,ab',a'b'\}=ab.$   Let $z\in AB,$ then there exists $x\in A, y\in B$ such that $z=xy.$ Since $x\geq 0,$  $xy\leq xb\leq ab.$ And so $c\leq ab.$  If $a=0,$ then we deduce that $a'=0,$ and so $A=\{0\}=AB,$ which shows the desired result is obvious.  If $a>0,$ then, for every $0<\epsilon<\min\{a,b\},$ we have $a-\epsilon>0, b-\epsilon>0.$ Hence there exist $x_1\in A, y_1\in B$ such that $x_1>a-\epsilon >0, y_1>b-\epsilon>0,$ which implies that $x_1y_1>(a-\epsilon)(b-\epsilon)=ab-\epsilon(a+b-\epsilon).$ Since $\lim_{\epsilon\to 0+}\epsilon(a+b-\epsilon)=0,$ we have, by the order preserving property of limit, $x_1y_1\geq ab,$ and so $c\geq ab.$   It follows  that $c=ab.$  Hence we have proved, in this case, that $\sup AB=c=ab=\max\{ab,a'b,ab',a'b'\}.$ (ii.2) $b\leq 0.$ Then $a'b'\leq a'b$ and $ab'\leq ab\leq a'b.$  So $\max\{ab,a'b,ab',a'b'\}=a'b.$  Let $z\in AB,$ then  there are $x\in A, y\in B$ such that $z=xy\leq xb\leq a'b,$ which implies that $c\leq a'b.$  On the other hand, for every $\epsilon >0,$   there exists $x_2\in A, y_2\in B,$ such that $0\leq x_2<a'+\epsilon, 0\geq b\geq y_2>b-\epsilon,$ it follows that $x_2y_2\geq (a'+\epsilon)y_2>(a'+\epsilon)(b-\epsilon)=a'b+\epsilon(b-a'-\epsilon),$ which implies that $x_2y_2\geq a'b.$  Thus $c\geq a'b.$  As a result, $c=a'b=\max\{ab,a'b,ab',a'b'\}.$ (iii) $a'<0, b'\geq 0.$  Swapping $A$ and $B,$ and   using Case (ii), the desired result follows. (iv) $a'<0, b'<0.$ There are four sub-cases. (iv.1)  $a> 0, b>0.$  That is, $a'<0<a, b'<0<b.$ Because in this case $a'b<0<a'b'\leq \max\{ab,a'b'\}$ and $ab'<0<ab\leq \max\{ab,a'b'\},$  we deduce that $\max\{ab,a'b,ab',a'b'\}=\max\{ab,a'b'\}.$   Then, for any $x\in A$ and $y\in B,$ we have $xy\leq \max\{ab, a'b'\}.$  Assume first that $\max\{ab, a'b'\}=a'b'.$  For sufficiently small $\epsilon>0,$ such that $a'+\epsilon<0$ and $b'+\epsilon<0,$  there exist $x^*\in A$ and $y^*\in B$ for which $x^*<a'+\epsilon<0$ and $y^*<b '+\epsilon<0.$ This gives $x^*y^*>(a'+\epsilon)(b'+\epsilon)=a'b'+\epsilon(a'+b'+\epsilon).$  Hence $\sup AB=c\geq x^*y^*\geq a'b'.$  Therefore $a'b'$ is the least upper bound  of $A\cdot B.$  In the case where $\max\{ab, a'b'\}=ab,$   for sufficiently small $\epsilon>0,$  such that   $a-\epsilon>0$ and $b-\epsilon>0,$  there exists $x_1\in A$ and $y_1\in B$ such that  $x_1>a-\epsilon>0,  y_1>b-\epsilon>0.$ This gives $x_1y_1>(a-\epsilon)(b-\epsilon)=ab-a\epsilon-\epsilon(b-\epsilon)=ab-\epsilon\big(a+b-\epsilon\big).$ Since   $\lim_{\epsilon\to 0+}\epsilon\big(  a+b-\epsilon\big)=0,$ the order preserving property of limit gives that $x_1y_1\geq ab,$ and hence $c\geq ab.$  Therefore $\sup (AB)=c=ab=\max\{ab,a'b,ab',a'b'\}.$ Therefore we have proved that, in this sub-case, $\sup AB=\max\{ab,ab',a'b,a'b'\}.$ (iv.2) $a>0, b\leq 0.$  Then $ab\leq 0\leq a'b\leq a'b',  ab'\leq 0\leq a'b',$ which gives that $\max\{ab,a'b,ab',a'b'\}=a'b'.$   In this case, for every $y\in B,$  $y\leq 0.$  Let $z\in AB,$ then there exist $x\in A, y\in B$ such that $z=xy.$  If $x\geq 0,$ then  since $a'< x\leq a,$ so $z=xy\leq a'y\leq a'b';$ while if $x<0,$ then $z=xy\leq a'y\leq a'b'.$  Hence $a'b'$ is an upper bound of $AB.$  Since $a'<0$ and $b'<0,$ for sufficiently small $\epsilon>0,$   such that $a'+\epsilon<0$ and $b'+\epsilon<0,$   there exist $x_1\in A, y_1\in B$ such that $x_1<a'+\epsilon<0, y_1<b'+\epsilon<0,$ which implies that   $x_1y_1>(a'+\epsilon)(b'+\epsilon)=a'b'+\epsilon(a'+b'+\epsilon)\to a'b', $ as $\epsilon\to 0+0.$ Hence $x_1y_1\geq a'b'.$  Thus $c=\sup AB\geq x_1y_1\geq a'b'.$  Therefore we have $\sup AB=c=a'b'=\max\{ab,a'b,ab',a'b'\}.$ (iv.3)  $a\leq 0, b>0.$  Similar to sub-case (iv.2), or you can argue by simply swapping  $A$ and $B.$ (iv.4) $a\leq 0, b\leq 0.$  Because in this case $a,a',b,b'$ are non-positive, $ab\leq a'b\leq a'b',$ and $ab'\leq a'b',$ we deduce that $\{ab,a'b,ab',a'b'\}=a'b'.$    For every $x\in A, y\in B,$ we have $a'\leq x\leq a\leq 0, b'\leq y\leq b\leq 0,$ so   $xy\leq a'b'.$  From this it follows that $a'b'$ is an upper bound of $AB.$   Let $\epsilon>0$ be sufficiently small such that  $a'+\epsilon<0$ and $b'+\epsilon<0.$   Then there exist $x_1\in A, y_1\in B$ such that $x_1<a'+\epsilon<0, y_1<b'+\epsilon<0.$ So $x_1y_1>(a'+\epsilon)(b'+\epsilon)=a'b'+\epsilon(a'+b'+\epsilon). $  It follows  that $c\geq a'b'.$  As a consequence, we have $c=a'b'=\max\{ab,a'b,ab',a'b'\}.$ $\qquad\Box$","I want to prove the following result: Theorem $\quad $ If $A$ and $B$ are bounded sets of real numbers, then     \begin{gather*}\tag{$\star$} 		\sup(A\cdot B)=\max\{\sup A\cdot\sup B, \sup A\cdot\inf B, \inf A\cdot\sup B, \inf A\cdot\inf B\}. 	\end{gather*} Although in the thread Show that  sup(A⋅B)=max{supA⋅supB,supA⋅infB,infA⋅supB,infA⋅infB} , some suggestions are given, but I have trouble in understanding them. So I have tried to prove as follows. Please check whether it is right or wrong. Note that $AB$ is defined by $$AB=\{z\in\mathbb{R}\mid \exists x\in A, y\in B: z=xy\}.$$ In order to prove this theorem, we need the following lemma. Lemma $\quad $ Let $A$ and $B$ be nonempty sets of nonnegative real numbers. Suppose that $A$ and $B$  are bounded  above. Then     \begin{gather*} 		\sup AB=\sup A\cdot\sup B. 	\end{gather*} Proof. Let $A\subset [0,+\infty)$ and $B\subset [0,+\infty),$ and $A,B$ nonempty, bounded above.  Put $a=\sup A, b=\sup B, c=\sup AB.$ Since $A\subset [0,+\infty)$ and $B\subset [0,+\infty),$   we see that $0$ is a lower bound of both $A$ and $B,$ so $a, b, c$ are nonnegative.  Let $z\in AB.$ Then there are $x\in A, y\in B$ such that $z=xy.$  Since $0\leq x\leq a$ and $0\leq y\leq b,$ we have $xy\leq ab.$  So $z\leq ab.$ By arbitrariness of $z,$ we deduce that $ab$ is an upper bound  of $AB.$  Hence $c\leq ab.$   Note that $c\geq0.$  If $c<ab,$ then we have $a>0$ and $b>0.$ It follows that $\frac{c}{b}<a=\sup A.$  Hence there exists $x_1\in A$ such that $\frac{c}{b}<x_1.$  So $x_1>0.$ Then we deduce that $\frac{c}{x_1}<b=\sup B.$ So there exists $y_1\in B$ such that $\frac{c}{x_1}<y_1.$ From $x_1>0$ it follows that $c<x_1y_1.$  But $x_1y_1\in AB,$ so we have $\sup AB=c<x_1y_1\in AB,$ which is absurd.  Hence we have $c\geq ab.$ And thus we conclude that $\sup AB=c=ab=\sup A\cdot \sup B.$  $\qquad\Box$ Proof of the theorem. let $A$ and $B$ be bounded sets of real numbers. Put   \begin{gather*}  	a=\sup A, \quad a'=\inf A,\quad b=\sup B,\quad b'=\inf B, \quad c=\sup AB.  \end{gather*}   We shall prove that $c=\max\{ab,a'b,ab',a'b'\}.$   And we plan to prove this statement by cases. (i)   Case $a'\geq 0, b'\geq 0.$   Thus, for $x\in A$ and $y\in B,$ we have $a\geq x\geq a'\geq 0, b\geq y\geq b'\geq 0,$ so $A\subset [0,+\infty), B\subset [0,+\infty),$ and  $a'b\leq ab,  ab'\leq ab, a' b'\leq ab,$ which implies  that $\max\{ab,a'b,ab',a'b'\}=ab.$  By the above Lemma , we have $\sup AB=\sup A\cdot \sup B=ab.$ Hence in this case the desired equality $(\star)$ holds. (ii) $a'\geq 0, b'<0.$   In this case we have for all $x\in A,$  $x\geq a'\geq 0,$ and so $x\geq 0.$ We consider two sub-cases. (ii.1) $b>0.$  In this case $0\leq a'\leq a,  b'<0<b,$ so $a'b\leq ab, ab'\leq a'b'\leq 0\leq ab,$ which gives that   $\max\{ab,a'b,ab',a'b'\}=ab.$   Let $z\in AB,$ then there exists $x\in A, y\in B$ such that $z=xy.$ Since $x\geq 0,$  $xy\leq xb\leq ab.$ And so $c\leq ab.$  If $a=0,$ then we deduce that $a'=0,$ and so $A=\{0\}=AB,$ which shows the desired result is obvious.  If $a>0,$ then, for every $0<\epsilon<\min\{a,b\},$ we have $a-\epsilon>0, b-\epsilon>0.$ Hence there exist $x_1\in A, y_1\in B$ such that $x_1>a-\epsilon >0, y_1>b-\epsilon>0,$ which implies that $x_1y_1>(a-\epsilon)(b-\epsilon)=ab-\epsilon(a+b-\epsilon).$ Since $\lim_{\epsilon\to 0+}\epsilon(a+b-\epsilon)=0,$ we have, by the order preserving property of limit, $x_1y_1\geq ab,$ and so $c\geq ab.$   It follows  that $c=ab.$  Hence we have proved, in this case, that $\sup AB=c=ab=\max\{ab,a'b,ab',a'b'\}.$ (ii.2) $b\leq 0.$ Then $a'b'\leq a'b$ and $ab'\leq ab\leq a'b.$  So $\max\{ab,a'b,ab',a'b'\}=a'b.$  Let $z\in AB,$ then  there are $x\in A, y\in B$ such that $z=xy\leq xb\leq a'b,$ which implies that $c\leq a'b.$  On the other hand, for every $\epsilon >0,$   there exists $x_2\in A, y_2\in B,$ such that $0\leq x_2<a'+\epsilon, 0\geq b\geq y_2>b-\epsilon,$ it follows that $x_2y_2\geq (a'+\epsilon)y_2>(a'+\epsilon)(b-\epsilon)=a'b+\epsilon(b-a'-\epsilon),$ which implies that $x_2y_2\geq a'b.$  Thus $c\geq a'b.$  As a result, $c=a'b=\max\{ab,a'b,ab',a'b'\}.$ (iii) $a'<0, b'\geq 0.$  Swapping $A$ and $B,$ and   using Case (ii), the desired result follows. (iv) $a'<0, b'<0.$ There are four sub-cases. (iv.1)  $a> 0, b>0.$  That is, $a'<0<a, b'<0<b.$ Because in this case $a'b<0<a'b'\leq \max\{ab,a'b'\}$ and $ab'<0<ab\leq \max\{ab,a'b'\},$  we deduce that $\max\{ab,a'b,ab',a'b'\}=\max\{ab,a'b'\}.$   Then, for any $x\in A$ and $y\in B,$ we have $xy\leq \max\{ab, a'b'\}.$  Assume first that $\max\{ab, a'b'\}=a'b'.$  For sufficiently small $\epsilon>0,$ such that $a'+\epsilon<0$ and $b'+\epsilon<0,$  there exist $x^*\in A$ and $y^*\in B$ for which $x^*<a'+\epsilon<0$ and $y^*<b '+\epsilon<0.$ This gives $x^*y^*>(a'+\epsilon)(b'+\epsilon)=a'b'+\epsilon(a'+b'+\epsilon).$  Hence $\sup AB=c\geq x^*y^*\geq a'b'.$  Therefore $a'b'$ is the least upper bound  of $A\cdot B.$  In the case where $\max\{ab, a'b'\}=ab,$   for sufficiently small $\epsilon>0,$  such that   $a-\epsilon>0$ and $b-\epsilon>0,$  there exists $x_1\in A$ and $y_1\in B$ such that  $x_1>a-\epsilon>0,  y_1>b-\epsilon>0.$ This gives $x_1y_1>(a-\epsilon)(b-\epsilon)=ab-a\epsilon-\epsilon(b-\epsilon)=ab-\epsilon\big(a+b-\epsilon\big).$ Since   $\lim_{\epsilon\to 0+}\epsilon\big(  a+b-\epsilon\big)=0,$ the order preserving property of limit gives that $x_1y_1\geq ab,$ and hence $c\geq ab.$  Therefore $\sup (AB)=c=ab=\max\{ab,a'b,ab',a'b'\}.$ Therefore we have proved that, in this sub-case, $\sup AB=\max\{ab,ab',a'b,a'b'\}.$ (iv.2) $a>0, b\leq 0.$  Then $ab\leq 0\leq a'b\leq a'b',  ab'\leq 0\leq a'b',$ which gives that $\max\{ab,a'b,ab',a'b'\}=a'b'.$   In this case, for every $y\in B,$  $y\leq 0.$  Let $z\in AB,$ then there exist $x\in A, y\in B$ such that $z=xy.$  If $x\geq 0,$ then  since $a'< x\leq a,$ so $z=xy\leq a'y\leq a'b';$ while if $x<0,$ then $z=xy\leq a'y\leq a'b'.$  Hence $a'b'$ is an upper bound of $AB.$  Since $a'<0$ and $b'<0,$ for sufficiently small $\epsilon>0,$   such that $a'+\epsilon<0$ and $b'+\epsilon<0,$   there exist $x_1\in A, y_1\in B$ such that $x_1<a'+\epsilon<0, y_1<b'+\epsilon<0,$ which implies that   $x_1y_1>(a'+\epsilon)(b'+\epsilon)=a'b'+\epsilon(a'+b'+\epsilon)\to a'b', $ as $\epsilon\to 0+0.$ Hence $x_1y_1\geq a'b'.$  Thus $c=\sup AB\geq x_1y_1\geq a'b'.$  Therefore we have $\sup AB=c=a'b'=\max\{ab,a'b,ab',a'b'\}.$ (iv.3)  $a\leq 0, b>0.$  Similar to sub-case (iv.2), or you can argue by simply swapping  $A$ and $B.$ (iv.4) $a\leq 0, b\leq 0.$  Because in this case $a,a',b,b'$ are non-positive, $ab\leq a'b\leq a'b',$ and $ab'\leq a'b',$ we deduce that $\{ab,a'b,ab',a'b'\}=a'b'.$    For every $x\in A, y\in B,$ we have $a'\leq x\leq a\leq 0, b'\leq y\leq b\leq 0,$ so   $xy\leq a'b'.$  From this it follows that $a'b'$ is an upper bound of $AB.$   Let $\epsilon>0$ be sufficiently small such that  $a'+\epsilon<0$ and $b'+\epsilon<0.$   Then there exist $x_1\in A, y_1\in B$ such that $x_1<a'+\epsilon<0, y_1<b'+\epsilon<0.$ So $x_1y_1>(a'+\epsilon)(b'+\epsilon)=a'b'+\epsilon(a'+b'+\epsilon). $  It follows  that $c\geq a'b'.$  As a consequence, we have $c=a'b'=\max\{ab,a'b,ab',a'b'\}.$ $\qquad\Box$",,"['analysis', 'proof-verification', 'supremum-and-infimum']"

Some smooth functions are not analytic, the most notorious example being the bump functions. A non-analytic $\mathcal{C}^\infty$ function seems (formally at least) ""less smooth"" that an analytic function, but I am wondering how one can quantify this. Looking at derivability does not give us anything (since a $\mathcal{C}^\infty$ is, well, $\mathcal{C}^\infty$), and looking at the radius of convergence of the Taylor series does not give us anything we do not already know. So, what if we look at the Fourier transform? This is a classical strategy: to quantify the smoothness of a function, quantify the integrability or the decay of its Fourier transform. Let's assume that we work in Scwhartz space $\mathcal{S} (\mathbb{R})$. Then: For any $f$ in $\mathcal{S} (\mathbb{R})$, if $\hat{f} (x) =_{\pm \infty} O (e^{-|x|^{1+\varepsilon}})$ for some $\varepsilon > 0$, then $f$ is analytic (I am not one hundred percent sure - I have not proved with utter rigour - but it seems rather safe).

So I have two questions: Are there analytic functions $f$ in $\mathcal{S} (\mathbb{R})$ such that $\hat{f} (x)$ has a magnitude of roughly $e^{-|x|^{1-\varepsilon}}$ for some $\varepsilon > 0$ ? If it where not the case, and provided what I said before is true, then we would know that functions whose Fourier transform is of order $e^{-|x|^{1-\varepsilon}}$ are $\mathcal{C}^\infty$ but not analytic, and that functions whose Fourier transform is of order $e^{-|x|^{1+\varepsilon}}$ are analytic. What about intermediate growth rates, for instance when $\hat{f} (x)$ has a magnitude of roughly $e^{-C|x|}$? Of course, any more precise criterion or any related reference is welcome.

So, what if we look at the Fourier transform? This is a classical strategy: to quantify the smoothness of a function, quantify the integrability or the decay of its Fourier transform. Let's assume that we work in Scwhartz space $\mathcal{S} (\mathbb{R})$. Then: For any $f$ in $\mathcal{S} (\mathbb{R})$, if $\hat{f} (x) =_{\pm \infty} O (e^{-|x|^{1+\varepsilon}})$ for some $\varepsilon > 0$, then $f$ is analytic (I am not one hundred percent sure - I have not proved with utter rigour - but it seems rather safe). For all $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists a bump function $f$ such that $\hat{f} (x)$ has a magnitude of roughly(*) $e^{-|x|^{1-\varepsilon}}$ for large enough $|x|$ (again, I am not totally sure, but I think this is what is said in http://math.mit.edu/~stevenj/bump-saddle.pdf ). So I have two questions: Are there analytic functions $f$ in $\mathcal{S} (\mathbb{R})$ such that $\hat{f} (x)$ has a magnitude of roughly $e^{-|x|^{1-\varepsilon}}$ for some $\varepsilon > 0$ ? If it where not the case, and provided what I said before is true, then we would know that functions whose Fourier transform is of order $e^{-|x|^{1-\varepsilon}}$ are $\mathcal{C}^\infty$ but not analytic, and that functions whose Fourier transform is of order $e^{-|x|^{1+\varepsilon}}$ are analytic. What about intermediate growth rates, for instance when $\hat{f} (x)$ has a magnitude of roughly $e^{-C|x|}$? Of course, any more precise criterion or any related reference is welcome. (*) To be more precise : $\limsup_{x \to \pm \infty} \frac{-\ln |\hat{f} (x)|}{|x|^{1-\varepsilon}} = 1$.",,"['analysis', 'fourier-analysis']"
