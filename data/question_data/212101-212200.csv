Initilally, I am giving some background and my question is after that. Helly's Theorem Let C be a finite family of convex sets in $R^n$ such that, for $k ≤ n + 1$, any $k$ members of C have a nonempty intersection. Then the intersection of all members of C is nonempty. As an application of Helly's therore we have: Corollary : Given $s (s > 0)$ points in the plane such that every three of them are contained in a disk of radius $1$. Prove that all $s$ points are contained in a disk of radius $1$. Proof Consider the set C of unit disks with centers at the points from a given set. Since every three of the given points are contained in a unit disk, any three disks from C have a nonempty intersection. By Helly's Theorem, all the disks have a nonempty intersection. Let $q$ be a point from the intersection. Then $q$ belongs to every disk from C and is, therefore, at a distance less than $1$ from there centers. In other words, all the centers of the disks from C lie in a disk of radius $1$ centered at $q$. Now like previous corollary does the follwoing  also true ?

And also, for each sequence $s$  we consider the following seven sequences: $$s_i=(x_i,x_{i+1},...,x_8,x_1,x_2,x_3,...,x_{i-1}),i=2,...,8$$ Prove that there are at least four matches between any sequence $s$ and some of the sequences $s_i$.

I've been studing the code in the Nvidia Cuda SDK regarding how to operate a convolution between matrix and kernel using FFT (so basically you transform matrix and kernel and perform a multiplication in the frequency domain.. eventually you inverse-transform the result and you're done). For the ones of you interested in the code quickly these are the classes http://nopaste.info/30c13e44fe.html http://nopaste.info/78d22afac2.html Anyway I got everything that the code does... excepted one thing: the code seems to perform a pre-processing step before the multiplication. After the multiplication the code is again post-processed. So seems like a signal modulation or signal processing of some kind I can't understand.. if it was for me I'd perform the multiplication without all these complications, but I suppose the author of the code had good reasons to add these processing steps.
