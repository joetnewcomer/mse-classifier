My question is the following: Do there exist two curves $X$ and $Y$ and a necessarily finite morphism $f:X \rightarrow Y$ such that  $$[k(X):k(Y)] > \text{max}_{P \in X}\{e_P\}$$ where $k(X)$ denotes the function field of $X$ and $e_P$ denotes the ramification index of the map at a point $P \in X$? My thoughts/attempts so far: Hurwitz's Theorem tells us that for a finite separable morphism of curves $f:X \rightarrow Y$ we have $$2g(X)-2=(\text{deg }f)(2g(Y)-2)+\text{deg }R$$ where $\text{deg }f=[k(X):k(Y)]$, $g(X)$ is the genus of $X$ and $R$ is the ramification divisor. That is, $\text{deg }R=\sum_{P\in X} (e_P-1)$. Using this I can note that a simple example may come from a morphism between two genus 0 curves that gives a field extension of degree 3 and ramifies at 4 points. In this case each ramification index would have to be 2 and hence the condition would be satisfied. I thought I had an example of higher genus using the double cover of the projective line over $k$ by an elliptic curve, however at one of the four points of ramification the index would have to be at least equal to the field extension degree. A related extension to this question is whether it is possible to have such a map that any possible ramification type occurs - that is, given two fixed genus values (necessarily $g(X)\geq g(Y)$ by Hurwitz) and $[k(X):k(Y)]$ fixed, can a morphism be constructed that ramifies at any allowable number of points with indices? Now I do not insist on the ramification indices all being smaller than the degree of the field extension. By allowable here I mean that deg $R$ is controlled by the fixed values by Hurwitz's Theorem, and so the greatest number of ramification points is deg $R$ each with index 2, but other partitions of deg $R$ with integers $\geq 2$ are possible.

63,Writing $\operatorname{Spec}\mathbb{Z}$ as an inverse limit of finite $T_0$-spaces,Writing  as an inverse limit of finite -spaces,\operatorname{Spec}\mathbb{Z} T_0,"I want to show that $\operatorname{Spec}\mathbb{Z}$ can be written as an inverse limit of finite $T_0$ -spaces. First off, $\operatorname{Spec}\mathbb{Z} = \{(0), (2),(3),(5),...\}$ , so the closed sets in the Zariski topology are precisely the points $(p)$ with $p \neq 0$ as well as finite unions of these points. Since prime numbers are countable, we could think of $\operatorname{Spec}\mathbb{Z}$ as the set $\mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty\}$ , where $\{\infty\}$ corresponds to the generic point $(0)$ , and the open sets $A \subseteq \mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty\}$ are precisely of the form $A= \tilde{A} \cup \{\infty\}$ , where $\tilde{A} \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is open in the cofinite topology, i.e. $\mathbb{N}\setminus \tilde{A}$ is a finite set. My idea now was consider finite spaces $X_i = \{1, ... , i\}$ , with some topology that looks similar to the cofinite topology. We want $\{i\}$ to be the generic point of $X_i$ , so maybe we can define maps $$f_{i,i+1} : X_{i+1} \rightarrow X_i, 1 \mapsto 1, a \mapsto a-1, a \neq 1$$ This way, the generic point $i+1$ of $X_{i+1}$ gets mapped to the generic point $i$ of $X_i$ , and every point gets mapped to a non-generic point. Now, for $i \leq j$ we can easily define maps $f_{i,j}$ by $f_{i,i} = id$ , and $f_{i,j}$ as the compositions of above maps. This defines an inverse system of topological spaces (assumed that these maps are continuous), hence we can consider $$X := \lim_{\leftarrow} X_i = \left\{(x_1, x_2, ...) \in \Pi_{i \in \mathbb{N}} X_i : x_i = f_{i,i+1}(x_{i+1})\right\}$$ We can see that the elements of $X$ are of the form $$X = \{(1,2,3,4,5,...), (1,1,2,3,4, ...), (1,1,1,2,3,4,...), ... , (1,1,1,...)\} \\  =\{(x_1, x_2,...) : \exists L \in \mathbb{N}\cup\{\infty\} \text{ s.t. } x_k = 1 \text{ }\forall k\leq L, x_k = k+1-L \text{ } \forall k>L\} \\ =: \{A_1, A_2, ... , A_{\infty}\} $$ This looks somewhat similar to $\operatorname{Spec}\mathbb{Z}$ , I would love to just map $A_\infty \mapsto (0)$ , $A_1 \mapsto (2)$ , $A_2 \mapsto (3)$ etc., but we require that this map is continuous as well. The topology on $X$ is given by the product topology, i.e. $U \subseteq X$ is open if it can be written as union of $\Pi_i U_i$ , where the $U_i \subseteq X_i$ are open, and $U_i = f_{i,i+1} (U_{i+1})$ . Now however, I don't know what topology to pick on the $X_i$ . We need the maps $f_{i,j}$ to be continuous, so I thought about picking the following topology on $X_i$ : $A \subseteq X_i$ open iff $A=\tilde{A} \cup \{i\}$ , where $\tilde{A} \subseteq \{1, ... , i-1\}$ . This looks somewhat similar to the cofinite topology but we have a finite space here, so it doesn't really work. First off, the $f_{i,j}$ are easily seen to be continuous, but $U_i :=\{1\} \cup \{i\}$ is always open in $X_i$ , which means that $U = \Pi_i U_i$ is open in $X$ , but this corresponds to $\{A_1, A_\infty\}$ open, which we do not want since $\{(0), (2)\}$ is not open in $\operatorname{Spec}\mathbb{Z}$ . What else could I try here? It seems like that the topology on $X_i$ needs to have bigger and bigger open sets so that in the limit we get infinitely big non-empty open sets, and also otherwise some finite union of the $A_i$ would be open. But these open sets also have to be stable under intersection, so in some way, they need to be somehow included in each other, so intersections cannot become arbitrarily small.

66,For what schemes $X$ are Cartier divisors the same thing as invertible subsheaves of $\mathcal{K}_X$?,For what schemes  are Cartier divisors the same thing as invertible subsheaves of ?,X \mathcal{K}_X,"Let $X$ be a scheme, and let $\mathcal{K}$ be the sheaf of total quotient rings of $X$ . Is the data of a Cartier divisor on $X$ equivalent to the data of an invertible subsheaf of $\mathcal{K}$ for all schemes $X$ or do we need additional assumptions? In more detail: In most (if not all) textbooks, a Cartier divisor is defined to be a global section of the sheaf $\mathcal{K}^*/O^*$ . Explicitly, it is given by the following data: an open cover $\{U_i\}$ of the scheme $X$ , and for each $i$ , an $f_i \in \Gamma(U_i, \mathcal{K}^*)$ , such that for each $i, j$ , $f_i/f_j \in \Gamma(U_i \cap U_j, O^*)$ . Two such data $\{(U_i, f_i)\}$ , $\{(V_j, g_j)\}$ define the same Cartier divisor if there is a common refinement $\{W_k\}$ such that $\displaystyle\frac{(f_i)|_{W_k}}{(g_j)|_{W_k}} \in \Gamma(W_k, O^*)$ . Given a Cartier divisor $D$ , one may construct an invertible sheaf $L(D)$ which is a subsheaf of $\mathcal{K}$ locally generated by $\displaystyle\frac{1}{f_i}$ on $U_i$ . All of this is stated in most textbooks, but the converse is usually not. It seems to me that this process can be reversed, i.e. given an invertible subsheaf $L \subseteq \mathcal{K}_X$ , we choose an open cover $\{U_i\}$ of $X$ such that $L|_{U_i}$ is trivial, which allows us to choose a trivializing section $g_i \in \Gamma(U_i, L) \subseteq \Gamma(U_i, \mathcal{K})$ . I believe the fact that $g_i$ generates $L|_{U_i} \cong O_{U_i}$ implies that $g_i$ is not a “zero-divisor”, therefore $g_i \in \Gamma(U_i, \mathcal{K}^*)$ . The intuition is that $\mathcal{K}^*$ models the total quotient ring in which an element is either a zero-divisor or a unit. But I am hesitant because I did not add any additional assumption on the scheme $X$ (e.g. integral, locally noetherian, etc) and after seeing a paper on misconceptions about $\mathcal{K}_X$ , I feel less confident about my reasoning. In any case, if the above reasoning stands, we have $g_i \in \Gamma(U_i, \mathcal{K}^*)$ , so we obtained a Cartier divisor $\{(U_i, g_i^{-1})\}$ (the condition $g_i/g_j \in \Gamma(U_i \cap U_j, O^*)$ is easy). The above constructions seem to be inverses of each other. That explains the title of the question: is a Cartier divisor the same thing as an invertible subsheaf of $\mathcal{K}_X$ on any scheme $X$ ? I hope someone can either confirm it or deny it. Along this line of thought, it is usually stated (e.g. Hartshorne Corollary 6.14) that on any scheme $X$ , the map $\text{CaCl} X \to \text{Pic} X$ from  the Cartier divisor class group to the Picard group is injective, but not surjective in general. I am wondering if the reason why it is not surjective is that one can’t always embed an invertible sheaf $L$ in $\mathcal{K}_X$ ? When $X$ is integral, as in Hartshorne Proposition 6.15, $\mathcal{K}_X$ is the constant sheaf of the function field of $X$ and $L \otimes \mathcal{K}_X \cong \mathcal{K}_X$ , so $L \hookrightarrow L \otimes \mathcal{K}_X \cong \mathcal{K}_X$ can be realized as a subsheaf of $\mathcal{K}_X$ .

(c) $\Rightarrow$ (a): for any invertible sheaf $L$ , we have an injection $L \hookrightarrow L \otimes_{\mathcal O_X} \mathcal K_X$ because $L$ is locally free of rank $1$ . If $L \otimes_{\mathcal O_X} \mathcal K_X \cong \mathcal K_X$ , then we get an embedding $L \hookrightarrow \mathcal K_X$ , therefore $L$ is isomorphic to an invertible subsheaf of $\mathcal K_X$ , which, by what we have settled, is $\mathcal O(D)$ for some Cartier divisor $D$ .

Is the data of a Cartier divisor on equivalent to the data of an invertible subsheaf of for all schemes or do we need additional assumptions? In more detail: In most (if not all) textbooks, a Cartier divisor is defined to be a global section of the sheaf . Explicitly, it is given by the following data: an open cover of the scheme , and for each , an , such that for each , . Two such data , define the same Cartier divisor if there is a common refinement such that . Given a Cartier divisor , one may construct an invertible sheaf which is a subsheaf of locally generated by on . All of this is stated in most textbooks, but the converse is usually not. It seems to me that this process can be reversed, i.e. given an invertible subsheaf , we choose an open cover of such that is trivial, which allows us to choose a trivializing section . I believe the fact that generates implies that is not a “zero-divisor”, therefore . The intuition is that models the total quotient ring in which an element is either a zero-divisor or a unit. But I am hesitant because I did not add any additional assumption on the scheme (e.g. integral, locally noetherian, etc) and after seeing a paper on misconceptions about , I feel less confident about my reasoning. In any case, if the above reasoning stands, we have , so we obtained a Cartier divisor (the condition is easy). The above constructions seem to be inverses of each other. That explains the title of the question: is a Cartier divisor the same thing as an invertible subsheaf of on any scheme ? I hope someone can either confirm it or deny it. Along this line of thought, it is usually stated (e.g. Hartshorne Corollary 6.14) that on any scheme , the map from  the Cartier divisor class group to the Picard group is injective, but not surjective in general. I am wondering if the reason why it is not surjective is that one can’t always embed an invertible sheaf in ? When is integral, as in Hartshorne Proposition 6.15, is the constant sheaf of the function field of and , so can be realized as a subsheaf of .

(in a polynomial ring over a field),\sqrt{I}=(f) \Rightarrow I=(f^n),"EDIT: imtrying46's answer in the comments is simpler than the one in the accepted answer (but both are good, and quite similar). This is a proof-verification question. If I'm correct, I still wonder if there are even more elementary proofs (see below), and whether I really never used assumption (4) as it seems to me. Assumptions: $K$ is a field. $I$ is an ideal of the polynomial ring $K[x_1,\dotsc,x_n]$ . The radical $\sqrt{I}$ of $I$ is generated by a single polynomial $f$ . $f$ is irreducible over the algebraic closure of $K$ . My question: Is $I=(f^n)$ for some $n\geq 1$ ? My attempt: I think the answer is Yes. Take the maximal $n$ such that $I\subset(f^n)$ ( $n\geq 1$ since $I\subset\sqrt{I}=(f)$ ). I'll prove that $I=(f^n)$ . Write $I=(f^nh_1,\dotsc,f^nh_r)$ . Then (using NSZ), $(f)=\sqrt{I}=I(V(f^nh_1,\dotsc,f^nh_r))=I(V(f^n)\cup V(h_1,\dotsc,h_r))= I(V(f^n))\cap I(V(h_1,\dotsc,h_r))=(f)\cap\sqrt{(h_1,\dotsc,h_r)}$ . In particular $f^\ell\in (h_1,\dotsc,h_r)$ for some $\ell\geq 0$ . The maximality of $n$ implies that $\ell=0$ . So $1\in (h_1,\dotsc,h_r)$ and thus $f^n \in (f^nh_1,\dotsc,f^nh_r)=I$ as needed.

Using the isomorphism in the previous sentence, we associate this point to the maximal ideal $(2, x)$ so that our residue field is simply $\kappa(p) = \mathbb{Z}_2$ . I know that the Zariski Tangent space in this case may be identified with the set of morphisms $$ \operatorname{Spec} \mathbb{Z}_2[\epsilon]/(\epsilon^2) \to \operatorname{Spec} A $$ mapping the unique point $[(\epsilon)]$ to $p$ . Any such map of affine schemes should correspond to some $\mathbb{Z}_2$ -linear map of global sections $$ \mathbb{Z}[x] / (x^2 + 4) \to \mathbb{Z}_2[\epsilon]/(\epsilon^2) $$ but now I think I'm starting to get a bit lost in the details of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ -linearity, where our generators should go and what the dimension as a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ vector space is. Is there any clean way to get the dimension of $T_{X,p}$ from this?

This seems incompatible with Hartshorne's theorem--shouldn't Vakil require that that the $n+1$ global sections generate the line bundle? Indeed, Vakil's proof claims that if $\phi$ is the morphism determined by the line bundle $\mathcal{L},$ then $\mathcal{L} \cong \phi^*\mathcal{O}(1).$ I do not think Vakil properly proves this if we do not know that $s_i = \phi^*(x_i)$$ generate the global sections. But let's assume Vakil's proof is right. Wouldn't this immediately imply the line bundle is generated by global sections, since a sheaf and its pullback have isomorphic germs, isomorphic global sections, and the isomorphisms are compatible with the global sections to germs restrictions? It thus seems that Vakil proves a much stronger claim that any line bundle with $n+1$ global sections with no common zeroes is in fact generated by those global sections. This claim seems false. Question: Is a morphism into projective space equivalent to the data of a line bundle and $n+1$ sections generating the bundle, or just $n+1$ sections with no common zeroes?
