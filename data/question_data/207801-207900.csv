I want to find $\lim_{n\to\infty}{\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}}$ If there are no zeros, $a_n = 2^{n+1}$ because we can choose 4 digits in the first position and then 2 in each subsequent position.

I was reading about Backward Reasoning, but I was not able to figure out how it works and what it really is. While reading I came across the following example mentioned in Kenneth Rosen book. Question: Given two positive real numbers x and y, their arithmetic mean is (x + y)/2 and their geometric mean is √xy . When we compare the arithmetic and geometric means of pairs of distinct positive real numbers, we find that the arithmetic mean is always greater than the geometric mean. [For example, when x = 4 and y = 6, we have 5 = (4 + 6)/2 > √4 · 6 =√24.] Can we prove that this inequality is always true? Solution: To prove that (x + y)/2 > √xy when x and y are distinct positive real numbers , we can work backward. We construct a sequence of equivalent inequalities. The equivalent inequalities are (x + y)/2 > √xy, (x + y) 2 /4 > xy, (x + y) 2 > 4xy, x 2 + 2xy + y 2 > 4xy, x 2 − 2xy + y 2 > 0, (x − y) 2 > 0. Because (x − y) 2 > 0 when x != y , it follows that the final inequality is true. Because all these inequalities are equivalent, it follows that (x + y)/2 > √xy when x != y . Once we have carried out this backward reasoning, we can easily reverse the steps to construct a proof using forward reasoning. We now give this proof. Suppose that x and y are distinct positive real numbers. Then (x − y) 2 > 0 because the square of a nonzero real number is positive. Because (x − y) 2 =  x 2 - 2xy + y 2 > 0 . Adding 4xy to both sides, we obtain x 2 + 2xy + y 2 > 4xy . Because x 2 + 2xy + y 2 = (x + y) 2 , this means that (x + y) 2 ≥ 4xy . Dividing both sides of this equation by 4, we see that (x + y) 2 /4 > xy . Finally, taking square roots of both sides (which preserves the inequality because both sides are positive) yields (x + y)/2 > √xy . We conclude that if x and y are distinct positive real numbers, then their arithmetic mean (x + y)/2 is greater than their geometric mean √xy . I didn't understand this proof. This proof is like if you have to prove a = b, then you add 5 both sides and get a+5 = b+5. Now using forward reasoning you prove a = b. Correct me if I am wrong.

The sum of the degrees gives , so the number of the edges must be , and that alone doesn't prevent the graph from being possible (consider a parallelogram with its diagonals drawn - the two extra vertices are at the midpoints of two parallels).

My attempt At first I counted the number of ways to place the balls so that all the cells are occupied. By PHP, we know that a cell can not contain $\ge 3$ balls.

The question is: Let $r$ be the smallest positive quadratic non-residue modulo $p \geq 3$ , that is, the smallest positive integer $r$ for which the congruence $x^2 \equiv r \enspace (\textrm{mod} \enspace p)$ has no solution. Prove that r is a prime number. Any help is appreciated. Thank you!","I've been struggling to find the solution for this question for a while now and thought I might as well ask for some help.
