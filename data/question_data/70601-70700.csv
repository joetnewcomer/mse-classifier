0,Does a Homotopy on the Boundary Induce a Homotopy to the Entire Manifold?,Does a Homotopy on the Boundary Induce a Homotopy to the Entire Manifold?,,"Let $M$ and $N$ be smooth manifolds where $M$ has a non-empty boundary. Let $F:M\to N$ be a smooth map, and the restriction of $f$ on $\partial M$ be denoted as $f$. Let $H:\partial M\times I\to N$ be a homotopy between $f$ and a smooth map $g:\partial M\to N$. Question. Does there necessarily exist a map $G:M\to N$ such that $G$ is homotopic to $F$ and the restrction of $G$ to $\partial M$ is $g$. The answer is true if we work in the continuous category rather than the smooth category, that is, $M$ and $N$ are topological manifolds, and $F, H, f$, and $g$ are continuous maps. This is because if $H:\partial M\times I\to N$ is a homotopy between $f$ and $g$, with $H_0=f$ and $H_1=g$, then we can paste $\partial M\times \{0\}$ along $\partial$ $M$ by identifying $(x, 0)$ with $x$, and get a new map $G:(M\cup (\partial M\times I))/\sim \ \to N$ which has the property that $G|_M = F$ and $G|_{\partial M\times \{1\}} = g$. Now we use the fact that $M$ admits a collar neighborhood homeomorphic to $\partial M\times I$ around its boundary to construct a homotopy between $F$ and $G$. Of course, this construction, as such, does not work for the smooth case, because there is no guarantee that the $G$ that we get is smooth, provided we give the manifold obtained after pasting a suitable smooth structure.","Let $M$ and $N$ be smooth manifolds where $M$ has a non-empty boundary.

5,Existence of Closed Curves around Bounded Components,Existence of Closed Curves around Bounded Components,,"I am stuck on part of a complex analysis proof that I think needs more justification than given.  It's pretty purely a topological statement, but it may be that complex-analytic techniques would be useful.  Basically, the statement boils down to this: Let $U \subset \mathbb{C}$ be open and connected, and let $K \subset \mathbb{C} \setminus U$ be a bounded component of the complement.  Then there exists a curve in $U$ bounding $K$. Is there any way to prove this statement without the Jordan-Schoenflies lemma, i.e. in a more elementary manner?  I have tried a lot of random stuff but nothing seems to work.  In particular, if there is a way to prove it with the argument principle that would be ideal, but not necessary. I appreciate any help at all. EDIT: So I really think this is a worthwhile question so I put the pitiful bounty I could afford haha. The things that need to be worried about are things like the complement of a Cantor set, and other lower-dimensional components of the complement. So we consider the set $U_1 = \lbrace z$ $|$ $\exists \text{ (simple) closed curve } \gamma \subset U \text{with } z \text{ in a bounded component of } \mathbb{C} \setminus \gamma \rbrace$ Then $U_1$ is open, since we can write it as the union of the (open) interiors of bounded components of all curves in $U$, say $U_1 = \cup_{\gamma_{\alpha} \in \Gamma} (\cup_1^{n_{\alpha}} C_{\alpha, k})$ for $\Gamma$ the set of all closed curves in $U$. Now each $\bar{C_{\alpha, k}}$ intersects $\gamma_{\alpha} \subset U$ so that $\bar{C_{\alpha, k}} \cap U \neq \varnothing$, and writing $U_1$ as a union of all such sets, which each have (connected) $U$ in common, we get that $U_1$ is connected.  Since it's open and $\mathbb{C}$ is locally path-connected, $U_1$ is path-connected. Now, we can iterate this construction, then; if $\Gamma_k$ is the collection of all closed curves in $U_k$, write $U_{k+1} = \lbrace z$ $|$ $\exists \text{ (simple) closed curve } \gamma \in \Gamma_k \subset U_k \text{with } z \text{ in a bounded component of } \mathbb{C} \setminus \gamma \rbrace$ Then let $V = \cup U_k$.  Then any closed curve in $V$ is compact, and since each $U_k$ is open it is thus contained in finitely many such.  But this is a nested sequence, so it lies entirely within some $U_n$.  But all points in the bounded components of the curve are in $U_{n+1} \subset V$ so that the curve is homologous to zero in $V$. By a theorem, $V$ is thus simply connected.  So the crux is to show that, in fact, $V = U_1$. But that's where I get stuck.  We can also use the fact that a set is simply connected iff the complement in the sphere is the (connected) component of infinity.  To show that it contains this set is the difficult direction; that the complement of the infinity component contains $V$ is trivial. A proof should not use any theorem with the name ""Jordan"" in it, nor the word ""homotopy"".  These proofs are obvious.  I would say that from dimension theory, the Painleve Theorem is ok to use, but otherwise to avoid dimension.  I would also consider it a solution to show that the statement implies either the Jordan-Schoenflies theorem for dimension 2, or the Annulus Theorem for dimension 2.

Show that if $Y$ is compact, then $X$ is compact. My question is why do we need $f$ to be continuous? It seems I can prove this result without continuity. Here is my proof: Let $\left\{ U_{\alpha}:\alpha\in J\right\} $ be an open covering   of $X$ . Since $f$ is surjective and $f^{-1}\left(y\right)$ is compact,   for any $y\in Y$ , there exists a finite set $J_{y}\subset J$ such   that $\left\{ U_{\alpha}:\alpha\in J_{y}\right\} $ is an open covering   of $f^{-1}\left(y\right)$ .

For any $y\in Y$ , $\cup_{\alpha\in J_{y}}U_{\alpha}$ is an open   set in $X$ . Hence, $X-\cup_{\alpha\in J_{y}}U_{\alpha}$ is closed.   Since $f$ is a closed mapping, we know $Y-f\left(X-\cup_{\alpha\in J_{y}}U_{\alpha}\right)$ is open. Since $y\in Y-f\left(X-\cup_{\alpha\in J_{y}}U_{\alpha}\right)$ ,   there exists a neightbourhood $V_{y}$ of $y$ , such that $V_{y}\subset Y-f\left(X-\cup_{\alpha\in J_{y}}U_{\alpha}\right)$ .   In other words, $f^{-1}\left(V_{y}\right)\subset\cup_{\alpha\in J_{y}}U_{\alpha}$ .   Since $Y$ is compact, there exists a finite set $\tilde{Y}$ such   that $Y\subset\cup_{y\in\tilde{Y}}V_{y}$ . Therefore, $$ X=f^{-1}\left(Y\right)\subset f^{-1}\left(\cup_{y\in\tilde{Y}}V_{y}\right)=\cup_{y\in\tilde{Y}}f^{-1}\left(V_{y}\right)\subset\cup_{y\in\tilde{Y}}\left(\cup_{\alpha\in J_{y}}U_{\alpha}\right)=\cup_{\alpha\in J'}U_{\alpha} $$ where $J'=\cup_{y\in\tilde{Y}}J_{y}$ is a finite set.

8,The cone of a topological space is contractible and simply connected,The cone of a topological space is contractible and simply connected,,"I would like help in verifying my proof and making it rigorous. Question: Let $X$ be a topological space. The cone on $X$ , denoted $CX$ , is the quotient space $(X × [0, 1])/(X × \{0\})$ .  Prove that $CX$ is contractible and simply connected? (note: $X/A$ is the quotient space $X/\mathord{∼}$ for an equivalence relation $∼$ on $X$ such that the equivalence classes are $A$ itself, and the singletons $\{x\}$ such that $x \notin A$ .) My Answer: A previous answer by kobe shows that $CX$ is contractible: Consider the map $H: X \times [0,1] \times [0,1] → X \times [0,1]$ defined by $H((x,t),s) = (x(1-s)t)$ . Then $H$ is continuous and $H((x,0,s) = (x,0)$ for all $x∈X$ and $s∈[0,1]$ . $H$ induces a continuous map $\hat{H}$ : $CX \times [0,1] → CX$ such that $\hat{H}([(x,t)],s) = [(x,(1-s)t)]$ .  Now $\hat{H}[(x,t)],0) = [(x,t)]$ and $\hat{H}[(x,t)],1) = [(x,0)] = X \times \{0\}$ . So $\hat{H}$ is a homotopy in $CX$ from the identity on $CX$ to the point $X \times \{0\}$ .  Consequently, $CX$ is contractible. $CX$ is simply connected as a result of being contractible.  To show this, we show that all contractible spaces are simply connected.  Let $X$ by contractible.  We will show that any loop in $X$ is homotopic, relative to $\{ 0,1 \}$ , to the constant loop.  Observe that the homotopy $F$ from the identity on $X$ to the constant map at $x∈X$ gives us a homotopy $G(s,t) = F(α(s),t)$ from any loop $α$ based at $x$ to the constant loop at $x$ .  We must show that the homotopy is relative to $\{0,1\}$ . We use the fact that the square $[0,1] \times[0,1]$ is convex, so there is a straight line homotopy $H$ between any two paths from $a$ to $b$ in $[0,1] \times [0,1]$ , and so any two such paths are homotopic relative to $\{0,1\}$ .  Using this, we see that the path along the left edge of the square is homotopic, relative to $\{0,1\}$ , to the path along the bottom edge, up the right edge and back along the top edge of the square.  Composing the homotopies $H$ and $G$ gives us the homotopy relative to $\{0,1\}$ .  We have shown that any loop in $X$ is homotopic, relative to $\{0,1\}$ , to the constant loop and so it is path connected and the fundamental group $π_1(X,b)$ for a loop based at $b$ has only one element and $π_1(X,b) = \{e\}$ where $e$ is a constant. $X$ is path-connected and has a trivial fundamental group.

23,Linear transformation maps the first quadrant to a closed set,Linear transformation maps the first quadrant to a closed set,,"My question is Let $A: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$ be a linear transformation, how can one prove that $\{Ay|y\geq 0\}$ is a closed set? Here $y\geq 0$ means each component of $y$ $\geq 0$ . I can simplify the question in two ways Since the image of $A$ is a closed linear subspace of $\mathbb{R}^m$ , by replacing $\mathbb{R}^m$ with this linear subspace, we may assume A is surjective. After a change of basis of the codomain and a reordering of the basis of the domain, we may assume $A$ is of the form $[I|B]$ Any help or hints are appreciated, thank you. Ideas: Let $v_i=Ae_i$ , then my original statement is equivalent to saying the set $\{\sum a_iv_i |a_i\geq 0\}$ is a closed set. So I should now prove the following: For any $v_1,...,v_k \in \mathbb{R}^n$ , the set $S=\{\sum a_iv_i |a_i\geq 0\}$ is a closed subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ . I suspect that the set $S$ is an intersection of half spaces, from this the closedness will be obvious. Equivalently, I suspect that for each $x\notin S$ , there exists a half space $H$ (cut by a codimension 1 linear subspace)s.t. $S\subset H$ . Is this statement true? I guess this should be true after drawing some examples. New ideas: I am proving that the set $\{\sum a_iv_i|a_i\geq 0 \}$ is closed, and this is easy if all the $v_i$ 's are indeed independent, so I would want to prove the following: Let $S=\{$ linearly independent subsets of $\{v_i\}\}$ , then $\{\sum a_iv_i|a_i\geq 0\}=\cup_{T\subset S}\{$ non negative linear combinations of $T\}$ And this union is closed since it is a finite union of closed set. Equivalently, let $x=\sum a_iv_i,a_i\geq 0$ , I want to write $x=\sum b_ie_i$ , where $b_i\geq 0$ and $\{e_i\}\subset \{v_i\}$ is linearly independent. My proof is as follows: I can replace $\{v_i\}$ with a smaller subset of itself s.t. $x$ cannot be expressed by non negative linear combinations of any strictly smaller subset of it. Now I claim that this set is linearly independent. Suppose not, then we can write $c_1v_1+c_2v_2+\cdots + c_nv_n=0$ , with some $c_i$ 's are positive(since we can multiply the whole expression by $-1$ ) and I assume that $c_i>0$ for $i=1,2,\dots ,k$ and $c_i \leq 0$ for $i>k$ Now I assume $b=a_1/c_1=\min _{i=1,2,\dots ,k}{a_i/c_i}$ , Then I have $$x=\sum a_iv_i-b(\sum c_iv_i)=                      (a_2-bc_2)v_2     +(a_3-bc_3)+\cdots + (a_n-bc_n)v_n$$ Which is a non negative linear combinations of fewer vectors, contradicts to my assumption and hence the minimal set $\{v_i\}$ is linearly independent.","My question is Let be a linear transformation, how can one prove that is a closed set?

Then I am supposed to prove that $$S_{+} \approx S_{\text{north}}^+ \times S^{n-1}$$ where $S_{\text{north}}^+ = \{v \in S^n \mid v_{n+1} \ge 0 \}$ . However, doing so has been driving me absolutely crazy . When examining the fiber bundle $p:T \rightarrow S^n$ s.t. $p(x,w) = x$ , I know we have the local trivializations $$h_x: p^{-1}(U_x) \rightarrow U_x \times p^{-1}(x) \approx U_x \times S^{n-1}$$ where $U_x$ is the open hemisphere of $S^n$ that contains $x$ and is bounded by the tangent ""plane"" $P_x$ to $S^n$ at $x$ translated to intersect the origin of $R^{n+1}.$ In particular, $h_x(v,w) = (v, \pi_x(w))$ where $\pi_x$ is the projection onto $P_x$ . This almost seems to work since local trivializations are isomorphisms. So by picking $x$ to be $e_1$ , $P_x$ is the subspace $\{(v_1,...,v_n,0) \in \mathbb{R}^{n+1}\}$ and so $U_x$ is $\{v \in S^n \mid v_{n+1} > 0 \}$ , which is close to $S_{\text{north}}^+$ but doesn't allow $v_{n+1} = 0$ . Similarly, $p^{-1}(U_x) = \{(v,w) \in T \mid v_{n+1} > 0\}$ which is almost $S_+$ except for it excludes the case $v_{n+1} = 0$ . Trying to just add on these points doesn't work since $h_x$ is not injective when $v_{n+1} = 0$ (or involves the projection of a vector being zero). How could I show $S_{+} \approx S_{\text{north}}^+ \times S^{n-1}$ ? I don't even feel that this statement is true. UPDATE: (2/23) With help from the answer provided & comments, here is what I have (using the idea that a fiber bundle with contractible base is trivial). Method (1): Define $U_+ = S^n \setminus \{-e_1\}$ and $U_- = S^n \setminus \{e_1\}$ so that $S^n = U_+ \cup U_-$ with $U_+, U_-$ open and contractible. Let $\tilde{T} = \{(v,w) \in U_+ \times S^n \mid v \cdot w = 0\},$ meaning (given the definitions in the problem statement) that $$ S_+ \subseteq \tilde{T} \subseteq T.$$ Let $p: \tilde{T} \rightarrow U_+$ be a fiber bundle. (We know at least one such fiber bundle exists since there is the trivial bundle sending $(v,w) \mapsto v$ ). Since $U_+$ is contractible , this fiber bundle is trivial; that is, $\tilde{T} \approx U_+ \times F$ where $F$ is the fiber. Specifically, for $v$ fixed $$F = p^{-1}(v) = \{(v,w) \mid v\cdot w = 0\} \approx \{v\} \times S^{n-1} \approx S^{n-1}.$$ So $\tilde{T} \cong U_+ \times S^{n-1}.$ Since restrictions of homeomorphisms are still homeomorphisms, we can restrict this homeomorphism to the closed subspace $S_{\text{north}}^+$ of $U_+$ , so $$ S_{\text{north}}^+ \times S^{n-1} \approx \{(v,w) \in S_{\text{north}}^+ \times S^n \mid v \cdot w = 0\} = \{(v,w) \in S^n \times S^n \mid v \cdot w = 0, v_{n+1} \ge 0\} = S_+$$ by definition of hemisphere $S_{\text{north}}^+$ Thus, we have shown that $S_{+} \approxeq S_{\text{north}}^+ \times S^{n-1}.$ Is this argument correct? Is there some technical point I am missing? Method (2): (This uses the stereographic projection suggestion.) Let $p: S(S^n \setminus \{x\}) \rightarrow S^n \setminus \{x\}$ be the unit sphere bundle of $S^n \setminus \{x\}$ . Using the diffeomorphism $\Pi_x: S^n \setminus \{x\} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ , we then have $$S(S^n \setminus \{x\}) \overset{p}\rightarrow S^n \setminus \{x\} \overset{\Pi_x}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$$ is also a fiber bundle since $\Pi_x$ is a diffeomorphism. Since $\mathbb{R}^n$ is contractile, the bundle is trivial. Thus, $S(S^n \setminus \{x\}) \approx \mathbb{R}^n \times F$ where $F$ is $p^{-1}(\Pi_x^{-1}(v)) = S^{n-1}$ for any $v \in \mathbb{R}^n.$ So $$S(S^n \setminus \{x\}) \approx \mathbb{R}^n \times S^{n-1}$$ and by restricting $S^n \setminus \{x\}$ to its closed subspace $S_{\text{north}}^+$ (choosing $x \not \in S_{\text{north}}^+$ ), we have the homeomorphism $$S(S^+) \approx  S_{\text{north}}^+ \times S^{n-1}.$$ However, $S(S^+) = S_+$ ( right? ) so $S_+ \approx S_{\text{north}}^+ \times S^{n-1}.$ Are there any technical points or general ideas that are wrong here?

In general, algebraic properties of $\star$ are not preserved by this extension - e.g. $\widehat{+}$ has nontrivial idempotents and is non-commutative - but this extension can nonetheless be useful. I'm interested in understanding how noncommutative $\widehat{+}$ is (right now, the best result I know is that it has trivial center ). Normally one might attack this sort of question by looking at the commutator subgroup of $(\beta\mathbb{Z};\widehat{+})$ , but since $\widehat{+}$ is non-cancellative this doesn't make sense. We can however whip up a ""brute force"" analogue by considering $\widehat{+}$ and $\widehat{-}$ explicitly.
