Lets say I've got a sphere with radius $r = 70$ meters. This sphere has an Earth-like reference system in which coordinates are given as: (longitude, latitude). The coordinate system is exactly like the Earth's, so zero degrees latitude is on the ""equator"" of the sphere with $90$ degrees being the top or ""North pole"" of the sphere, and $-90$ degrees being the bottom or ""South pole"" of the sphere. Also, I've got one vertical line on which positive numbers go ""East"" and negative numbers go ""West"". On this sphere I've got two points with their location, both depicted in degrees: $$ \begin{gather}     (1, 1)\\     (3, 3) \end{gather} $$ Both points are drawn in the image I've drawn below. In this image, I've also drawn some ""help-lines"". I now need to find the length of $d$ (the distance between the two points). So far I can calculate the variables $a$ and $b$ , and I know that $D$ (the corner opposite of $d$ ) is 90 degrees. To calculate the distance of $d$ I use the Spherical law of cosines ( wiki here ): $$ \cos(d) = \cos(a) * \cos(b) + \sin(a) * \sin(b) * \cos(D) $$ Since we are using an Earth like reference system, however, the latitude range is $[-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]$ instead of $[0, \pi]$ and the longitude range is $[-\pi, \pi]$ instead of $[0, 2\pi]$ . I read that we therefore need to translate this law to the following: $$ \cos(d) = \sin(a) * \sin(b) + \cos(a) * \cos(b) * \cos(D) $$ Since the spherical law of cosines needs all variables in radians but our points on the sphere are given in degrees, I first transform the degrees to radians: $$ \begin{align}     a &= (3 - 1) * \frac{\pi}{180} = 0.0349065850399\\     b &= (3 - 1) * \frac{\pi}{180} = 0.0349065850399\\     D &= 90 * \frac{\pi}{180} = 1.5707963267948966 \end{align} $$ Filling this into the formula I get the following: $$ \begin{gather}     \cos(d) = \sin(a) * \sin(b) + \cos(a) * \cos(b) * \cos(D) = 0.00121797487009\\     d \text{ in radians} = 1.56957835162\\     \text{distance in meters} = d * 70 = 109.870484614 \end{gather} $$ The python code with which I calculate this can be found here: http://pastebin.com/U3qvXxRZ The answer I get here seems to be incorrect though. First of all, a distance of 109 meters between two points which are only two degrees apart on a sphere with a diameter of 140 meters seems like a lot to me. Second of all, if I move the points closer to each other, the distance_in_meters seems to increase. Thirdly, I found this little piece of python code ( here ), in which they seem to do it differently. They simply take the latitude of the first and second point as the variables 'a' and 'b', instead of the difference between the latitudes as 'a'. So my question. What am I doing wrong here?

44,"Convex polygons - For $n>3$, $\sum_{i=1}^{n} \cos\theta_i < \cos\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} {\theta_i}\right)$","Convex polygons - For ,",n>3 \sum_{i=1}^{n} \cos\theta_i < \cos\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} {\theta_i}\right),"It seems that for any convex polygon $P$ with $n>3$ sides and $n$ interior angles $\theta_i$ , $$\sum_{i=1}^{n} \sin\theta_i > \sin\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} {\theta_i}\right)$$ $$\sum_{i=1}^{n} \cos\theta_i < \cos\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} {\theta_i}\right)$$ The first inequality is really straightforward to prove. As $\sum_{i=1}^{n} {\theta_i}=(n-2)180^°$ , thus $\sin\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} {\theta_i}\right)=0 \space \forall n>2$ . The fact that $\sin \theta_i>0 \space \forall \theta_i\neq (k*180)^°$ concludes the proof. However, I have not been able to prove the second inequality. We have that $\cos\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} {\theta_i}\right)=-1 \space \forall n=2m+1, \space m\in \mathbb N$ and $\cos\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} {\theta_i}\right)=1 \space \forall n=2m, \space m\in \mathbb N$ . Also, $\cos \theta_i\geq 0 \space \forall \theta_i\leq 90^°$ and $\cos \theta_i< 0 \space \forall 90^°<\theta_i<180^°$ . Any hint, help or reference proving the second inequality would be welcomed. Thanks! EDIT After working on a proof of the second inequality using induction, by trial-and-error experiments, it seems that, for triangles, $\sum_{i=1}^{3} {\cos\theta_i}\leq 1.5$ ; for quadrilaterals, $\sum_{i=1}^{4} {\cos\theta_i}< 0.5$ ; for pentagons, $\sum_{i=1}^{5} {\cos\theta_i}< -0.5$ ; for hexagons, $\sum_{i=1}^{6} {\cos\theta_i}< -1.5$ ; for heptagons, $\sum_{i=1}^{7} {\cos\theta_i}< -2.5$ , ... Thus, the second inequality could be improved to affirm that for any convex polygon $P$ with $n$ sides and $n$ interior angles $\theta_i$ , $$\sum_{i=1}^{n} \cos\theta_i \leq 4.5-n$$ , with equality only when $n=3$ . The pattern arises as any triangle maximizes the sum of the cosines of interior angles when it has three acute angles equal to $60^º$ ; any quadrilateral maximizes the sum of the cosines of interior angles when it has three acute angles tending below to $60^º$ , and one obtuse angle tending above to $180^º$ ; and for $n>3$ , this pattern continues: any convex polygon maximizes the sum of the cosines of interior angles when it has three acute angles tending below to $60^º$ , and the rest of angles are obtuse angles tending above to $180^º$ . A proof by induction could then be constructed, proving the triangle case, and showing that adding an additional vertex to form some convex $(n+1)$ -polygon anexes a triangle of angles $\alpha,\beta$ and $(180^º-(\alpha+\beta))$ with one shared side with the $n$ -gon, so the sum of the cosines of interior angles of the $(n+1)$ -gon is $\cos\theta_{1}+\cos\theta_{2}+...+\cos(\theta_{n-1}+\alpha)+\cos(\theta_{n}+\beta)+\cos(180^º-(\alpha+\beta))$ . Applying the trigonometric identities, we need to show that $$\cos\theta_{1}+\cos\theta_{2}+...+(\cos\theta_{n-1}\cos\alpha-\sin\theta_{n-1}\sin\alpha)+(\cos\theta_{n}\cos\beta-\sin\theta_{n}\sin\beta)-\cos(\alpha+\beta)\leq \cos\theta_{1}+\cos\theta_{2}+...+\cos\theta_{n-1}+\cos\theta_{n}-1$$ Or, simplifying, $$(\cos\theta_{n-1}\cos\alpha-\sin\theta_{n-1}\sin\alpha)+(\cos\theta_{n}\cos\beta-\sin\theta_{n}\sin\beta)-\cos(\alpha+\beta)\leq \cos\theta_{n-1}+\cos\theta_{n}-1$$ , where at most one of $\alpha,\beta$ or $(\alpha+\beta)$ is equal or greater than $90^º$ . Proving the above inequality would finish the proof.

Any explanation needs to be broken down to chewable bits. I'm sorry if this inconveniences you guys. I have the following problem: How do I find out if a circle and an arc sector of another circle intersect? The small circles above are examples. The ones in red are the ones that do not intersect, the ones in green are that ones that do intersect. This is my approach, based on immediate data that I have available about the arc sector and the other circle: let $A$ be the arc sector of a circle defined as follows: $C$ $(Cx, Cy)$ is the centre of the circle. $D$ is a radius of the circle, of which we know the length. ($D$ stands for direction). $\alpha$ the angle of arc sector, so that $D$ bisects $\alpha$ We also know the point where $D$ intercepts the circle (not named in the drawing above) \begin{equation} \\ \end{equation} For the smaller circles: let $P$ be a circle, defined as follows: $c$ $(cx, cy)$ is the centre of the circle. $r$ is the radius of the circle. First, i check if $P$ is inside or intersects the circle defined by $C$ and $D$: $$(D + r)^2 \geq (Cx - cx)^2 + (Cy - cy)^2$$ (sum of the radii squared is greater than or equal to the squared distance between $C$ and $c$) Secondly, if the above is true, my plan is to find the angle between the radius $D$ and each of the two tangents to circle $P$ (there's a problem here, read bellow) that pass through $C$; if any of these two angles is equal to or smaller than $\frac{\alpha}{2}$, then I have an intersection. Note: The problem with this approach is that it doesn't work in case $C$ is inside $P$ (like the small green circle that contains C in figure 1). I disregard this case, because I don't know how to deal with it. In short, I know my answer is wrong, I'm just letting you know what I have so far. Considering that the set of arguments of my function that will result in $P$ containing $C$ is almost negligible, a result where those cases are excluded is acceptable, even if not ideal. I know how to find the angle between $Cc$ and the tangents: $$\measuredangle uCc = \measuredangle vCc = \arcsin(\frac{r}{d})$$ But I think that's irrelevant. What I need is to find the angle between each of the tangents (the black lines) and $D$, and if such angle is equal to or lesser than $\frac{\alpha}{2}$, then it's a hit, otherwise, a miss. I think I need to find the slopes of the lines $Cu$ and $Cv$, so I can compare it to the slope of $D$ to find the angle between those lines, using the relation: $$\tan(\theta) = \left| \frac{m_{a} - m_{b}}{1 + m_{a}m_{b}}\right|$$ For me to find the slopes of those lines, I think I need to know the points $u$ and $v$. There's one last problem with my approach: the function $arctan$ (which I would use to find $\theta$, given $\tan(\theta)$) can give me wrong results in case one of the circles is in a position inside the opposite arc $A'$ formed by extending $D$ and the legs of the arc into diameters. I hear $arctan2$ can fix this, but I'm not sure how to use it. If there's an easier solution than mine, it's very welcome.

67,Kind of a proof for the circumference of a circle?,Kind of a proof for the circumference of a circle?,,"Hello fellow StackExchange members! Some time ago, I was thinking about the proofs concerning the circumference of a circle and had the following idea. Having insufficient knowledge in trigonometry and calculus at that time, I couldn't get myself to ""do the math"". But after taking classes, I now have the ability (and time due to quarantine!) to share my proof with you. I do not know if this counts as a proof since we have a predefined definition of $π$ , but here is my way of thinking: In a regular polygon of $n$ sides and with a distance $r$ between its vertices and its center, we can use trigonometry to find the length of one side. ( $n∈\mathbb{Z}^+$ and $r∈\mathbb{R}^+$ ) First of all, we have to find the central angle $α$ between any two neighboring ""radii"" forming an isosceles triangle when looked at with the side connecting the two vertices. To find this, we can divide the central angle of $2π$ to the number of sides: $α=\frac{2π}{n}$ Next, we can use the law of cosines to calculate the length of the third side of the isosceles triangle, which also happens to be the side length of the regular polygon. Let's call the side length $s$ . $s=\sqrt{r^2+r^2-2⋅r⋅r⋅\cos(α)}=\sqrt{2r^2-2⋅r^2⋅\cos(\frac{2π}{n})}\\=r\sqrt{2-2\cos(\frac{2π}{n})}$ To find the total perimeter ( $P$ ) of the regular polygon, we have to multiply the number of sides by the side lenght: $P=n⋅r\sqrt{2-2\cos(\frac{2π}{n})}$ Now, when $n$ approaches infinity, our polygon should approach to being a circle; so if we take the limit  of this expression with $n$ approaching infinity, we should be able to approximate the circumference of the circle with a radius of $r$ . (I urge you to plot this function into a graphic calculator with $x$ instead of $n$ as a variable. As $x$ fets larger, the function approaches the value of $2πr$ . I was really happy to see this for the first time.) Before the limit, let's simplify our expression. I was careful with the domains and ranges of the trigonometric functions and rewriting the expression in the following way should not cause any problems while taking the limit at infinity. $n⋅r\sqrt{2-2\cos(\frac{2π}{n})}=n⋅r\sqrt{2(1-\cos(2⋅\frac{π}{n}))}\\=n⋅r\sqrt{2[1-(1-2\sin^2(\frac{π}{n}))]}=n⋅r\sqrt{4\sin^2(\frac{π}{n})}=2⋅n⋅r⋅\sin(\frac{π}{n})$ (That simplification was quite magical for my simple mind!) Let's now take the limit: $\lim_{n \to \infty} n⋅r\sqrt{2-2\cos(\frac{2π}{n})}=\lim_{n \to \infty}2⋅n⋅r⋅\sin(\frac{π}{n})=2r⋅\lim_{n \to \infty}n⋅\sin(\frac{π}{n})$ Now this was where I got stumped for a while; until I learned L'Hospital's Rule of course! We can rewrite the expression as follows: $2r⋅\lim_{n \to \infty}n⋅\sin(\frac{π}{n})=2r⋅\lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{\sin(\frac{π}{n})}{\frac{1}{n}}$ We now see that the limit gives us $\frac{0}{0}$ as $n$ approaches infinity so let's use L'Hospital's Rule: $2r⋅\lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{\sin(\frac{π}{n})}{\frac{1}{n}}=2r⋅\lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{\frac{d}{dn}(\sin(\frac{π}{n}))}{\frac{d}{dn}(\frac{1}{n})}\\=2r⋅\lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{\cos(\frac{π}{n})⋅(-\frac{π}{n^2})}{-\frac{1}{n^2}}=2r⋅\lim_{n \to \infty}π⋅\cos(\frac{π}{n})\\=2πr⋅\lim_{n \to \infty}\cos(\frac{π}{n})$ Since the limit of the fraction $\frac{π}{n}$ approaches $0$ , the value of $\cos(\frac{π}{n})$ approaches $1$ : $2πr⋅\lim_{n \to \infty}\cos(\frac{π}{n})=2πr⋅1=2πr$ And this is how I ended up with the circumference of a circle.

68,Is this derivation I did for the expansion of $\cos (\alpha+\beta)$ correct and how can I get rid of the $\pm$ symbol in it?,Is this derivation I did for the expansion of  correct and how can I get rid of the  symbol in it?,\cos (\alpha+\beta) \pm,"I derived the expansion of $\cos (\alpha + \beta)$ as follows, please take a look : Here, $\angle AOB = \alpha$ , $\angle BOC = \beta$ , $\angle AOC = (\alpha + \beta)$ , $a = \cos \alpha$ , $b = \sin \alpha$ , $m = \cos \beta$ , $n = \sin \beta$ , $x = \cos (\alpha + \beta)$ and $y = \sin (\alpha + \beta)$ . Something to be noticed : $a^2 + b^2 = m^2 + n^2 = x^2 + y^2 = 1$ as they all are sines and cosines of $\alpha$ , $\beta$ and $(\alpha + \beta)$ respectively. These equations will be used  further in the derivation. Now, from the above diagram,  we can find the length of chord $BC$ using the distance formula which states that the distance between two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ on the Cartesian Plane is : $\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2+(y_1-y_2)^2}$ . So, we get : $$BC = \sqrt{(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2} = \sqrt{x^2+a^2-2ax+y^2+b^2-2by} $$ $$ = \sqrt{(a^2+b^2)+(x^2+y^2)-2ax-2by} = \sqrt{2-2ax-2by}$$ Now, what I do is rotate the axes by an angle of $\alpha$ anticlockwise to obtain this : [The dotted lines represent the old axes whereas the red lines denote the new axes. The new X-Axis coincides with the line segment $OB$ ]. Now, the length of chord $BC$ will remain the same irrespective of the position of the coordinate axes. And, the point that was previously $B(a,b)$ is now $(0,1)$ and the point that was previously $C(x,y)$ is now $(m,n)$ because $\beta$ becomes an angle in standard position, so the point where the terminal side of $\beta$ will intersect with the unit circle will be $(\cos \beta, \sin \beta)$ , which as I mentioned earlier, can be written as $(m,n)$ because $m = cos \beta$ and $n = \sin \beta$ . So, in this ""new axes plane"", the length of what previously used to be $BC$ will now be : $$\sqrt{(m-1)^2+(n-0)^2} = \sqrt{m^2+1-2m+n^2} = \sqrt{(m^2+n^2)+1-2m} = \sqrt{2-2m}$$ Now, from the two values of the length of $BC$ that we have obtained by aligning the coordinate axes at two different positions are : $\sqrt{2-2ax-2by}$ and $\sqrt{2-2m}$ . We can equate these two values to arrive at the value of $x$ , which will give us the value of $\cos (\alpha + \beta)$ . $$\sqrt{2-2ax-2by} = \sqrt{2-2m}$$ . By squaring both sides, we obtain : $$2-2ax-2by = 2-2m$$ Now, we can cancel the term $2$ on both the sides to obtain this : $$-2ax-2by = -2m$$ Dividing both sides by $(-2)$ , we will obtain : $$ax+by=m$$ $$ax+b\sqrt{1-x^2}=m$$ $$b\sqrt{1-x^2} = m-ax$$ By squaring both the sides, we will obtain : $$b^2(1-x^2) = (m-ax)^2 = m^2+a^2x^2-2max$$ $$\therefore b^2-b^2x^2 = m^2+a^2x^2-2max$$ Now, we can convert this equation to the standard quadratic equation form $(Ax^2+Bx+C)$ and obtain this : $$(a^2+b^2)x^2+(-2ma)x+(m^2-b^2)=0$$ Here, $A = a^2+b^2$ which is equal to $1$ , $B = -2ma$ and $C = m^2-b^2$ Let $D$ denote the discriminant. $$\therefore D = B^2-4AC = B^2-4C = 4m^2a^2 - 4(m^2-b^2) = 4m^2a^2 - 4m^2 + 4b^2$$ $$\therefore D = 4(m^2a^2-m^2+b^2) = 4(m^2a^2-m^2+1-a^2) $$ $$ = 4(a^2(m^2-1)-1(m^2-a^2)) = 4(m^2-1)(a^2-1)$$ $$\therefore D = 4(-n^2)(-b^2) = 4n^2b^2 $$ $$ \implies \sqrt{D} = 2nb$$ . Now, by applying the quadratic formula, $$x = \dfrac{-B \pm \sqrt{D}}{2A} = \dfrac{2ma \pm 2nb}{2} = ma \pm nb$$ From this, we get our final result, $$\cos(\alpha + \beta) = \cos \alpha \cos \beta \pm \sin \alpha \sin \beta$$ Now, the only problem seems to be the $\pm$ symbol. How do I get rid of that and determine which symbol to actually put in its place? Also, please let me know about your thoughts on the derivation.

These equations will be used  further in the derivation. Now, from the above diagram,  we can find the length of chord using the distance formula which states that the distance between two points and on the Cartesian Plane is : . So, we get : Now, what I do is rotate the axes by an angle of anticlockwise to obtain this : [The dotted lines represent the old axes whereas the red lines denote the new axes. The new X-Axis coincides with the line segment ]. Now, the length of chord will remain the same irrespective of the position of the coordinate axes. And, the point that was previously is now and the point that was previously is now because becomes an angle in standard position, so the point where the terminal side of will intersect with the unit circle will be , which as I mentioned earlier, can be written as because and . So, in this ""new axes plane"", the length of what previously used to be will now be : Now, from the two values of the length of that we have obtained by aligning the coordinate axes at two different positions are : and .

By squaring both sides, we obtain : Now, we can cancel the term on both the sides to obtain this : Dividing both sides by , we will obtain : By squaring both the sides, we will obtain : Now, we can convert this equation to the standard quadratic equation form and obtain this : Here, which is equal to , and Let denote the discriminant. .

I had two problems with this question. I was getting two different answers using methods that should give the same answer and neither of those answers matched with the answer in the textbook. Attempt 1: What we want to figure out is the value for $d$. If we can figure out the values for $x$ and $y$, then we can use Pythagorean theorem to figure out the value for $d$. In this case, $$x = \frac{1515}{\tan 35^\circ} \qquad\text{and}\qquad y = \frac{1515}{tan 31^\circ}$$ We also know that $d =\sqrt{y^{2}-x^{2}}$, so $$d = \sqrt{\left(\frac{1515}{\tan 31^\circ}\right)^{2}- \left(\frac{1515}{\tan 35^\circ}\right)^{2}}$$ This makes the value of $d$ about 1294 meters. Attempt 2: We can figure out the value for $\theta$. In the ground level triangle $\theta = 258^\circ -180^\circ = 78^\circ$. This also means $\gamma = 90^\circ - 78^\circ = 12^\circ$.

I said ""That's absurd because $\cos(\frac x2)=\sqrt{\frac{1+\cos(x)}2}$, which evaluates to $2\sqrt{2+\sqrt{3}}$ for this particular $x$!"" So I finally decided to do this the non-radical way and found the decimal approximations to be equivalent. Which is weird and probably not a coincidence.

The following problem has been on my mind for a while. Lots of exact values of the arctangent function are known, such as $$\arctan 0=0$$ $$\arctan 1=\frac{\pi}{4}$$ $$\arctan \frac{1}{\sqrt 3}=\frac{\pi}{6}$$ However, I can't seem to find an exact value of $$\arctan 2$$ How can I find one?
