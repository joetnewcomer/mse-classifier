Is my proof correct? My attempt: $f$ must be injective. If not, there exist $a,b$ such that $f(a)=f(b)$, but then $f(g(f(a)))=f(g(f(b)))$, which contradicts the fact that $h$ is injective. $f$ must be surjective. If there is a value that is not taken by $f$, then it is certainly not taken by $h(x)=f(g(f(x)))$, contradicting that it is bijective. Suppose there exist $a,b$ such that $g(a)=g(b)$. Because $f$ is surjective, $a,b$ are in the range of $f$, and thus there exist $c,d$ such that $g(f(c))=g(f(d))$, and thus $f(g(f(c)))=f(g(f(d)))$, which contradicts the fact that $h$ is injective. Therefore $g$ is injective. Since $f$ is bijective, there is an unique $x$ such that $f(x)=p$. If $x$ is not in the range of $g$, then $p$ is not in the range of $h(x)=f(g(f(x)))$, contradicting that it is surjective. Therefore all real numbers are in the range of $g$, thus $g$ is surjective. Therefore both $f$ and $g$ are bijective. Is this proof correct?",,"['functions', 'proof-verification', 'functional-equations']"

In passing to induction, I noticed that this would imply that $0^0 = 1$, since there exists the trivial empty function (i.e., $\emptyset \times \emptyset = \emptyset$). The definition of exponentiation in $\omega$ says that $(\forall m \in \omega $ $(m^0 = 1))$, so this seems reasonable. Is this correct, or should this case be discarded?
