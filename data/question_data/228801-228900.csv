13,Validity of my proof for a Cartesian Product in Tao's book,Validity of my proof for a Cartesian Product in Tao's book,,"Before all, I'm apologize if my question is too common here. I'm only want to know if my proof is correct or need some adjustments. I'm reading the Terence Tao's Analysis book as I mentioned in my other question. The problem in the book says: *My approach for the first part, was: Let I be the set of all the natural numbers between 1 and n: $$ I:= \left \{  i \in N : 1 \leq i\leq n \right \} $$ (=>) So, if we assume that the both ordered n-tuple are equal:  $$ \left (x_{i} \right)_{i\in I} = \left (y_{i} \right)_{i\in I} $$ As the two functions are equal (by hypothesis). So for each i in I, we have that both are equal (using the definition of equality of function given in previous chapter by the author). Therefore:  $$  \left (\forall i \in I \right) \left (  x \left ( i \right)= y \left ( i \right) \right) $$ (<=) On the other hand, if we assume that: $$  \left (\forall i \in I \right) \left (  x_{i}= y_{i} \right) $$ As both function have the same domain and range that means both are equal: $$ \left (x_{i} \right)_{i\in I} = \left (y_{i} \right)_{i\in I} $$ *For the second part, I have some troubles but here is my approach: First we write the Cartesian product as the author do: $$ \prod_{i\in I} X_{i} := \left \{ \left (x_{i}  \right )_{i \in I}:\left(\forall i \in I \right) \left (x_{i} \in X_{i} \right)   \right \} $$ I form the set of all the functions from the set of natural numbers called I to a target set X, which I defined in the next way: $$ X^{I} \text{ where } X:= \bigcup_{i \in I} X_{i} $$ Then, using the axiom schema of specification we can form the set: $$ g\in \left \{ f\in  X^{I}  : \left (\forall i \in I \right) \left (f \left ( i \right) \in X_{i} \right)  \right \} \leftrightarrow \\ \left(\text{$g: I \rightarrow X$ is a mapping and } \left (\left (\forall i \in I \right) \left (f \left ( i \right) \in X_{i} \right)  \right ) \right ) $$ So, using the definition given by the author only we need to show that g is onto which means that define an ordered n-tuple (right?). $$ x \in X \leftrightarrow  x \in \bigcup_{i \in I} X_{i}\leftrightarrow \left (\exists i \in I   \right )\left ( x \in  X_{i} \right )  $$ g is surjective because for each x in the target set always we can find a i in the domain. Then, g is an ordered n-tuple. And that means g lies in collection of all n-tuples defined at the first place. On the other hand: $$ x\in \prod_{i\in I} X_{i}\leftrightarrow \left (x = \left (x_{i}  \right )_{i \in I}  \right )\text{ and } \left(\forall i \in I \right) \left (x_{i} \in X_{i} \right) $$ So, that means $x$ is an n-tuple and by hypothesis, $x$ is a surjective function from the set $I$ to $X$. Then, $x$ lies in set formed above. Hence, the Cartesian product is a set. (I'm sorry for my grammatical mistakes, English is not my first language).","Before all, I'm apologize if my question is too common here. I'm only want to know if my proof is correct or need some adjustments. I'm reading the Terence Tao's Analysis book as I mentioned in my other question. The problem in the book says: *My approach for the first part, was: Let I be the set of all the natural numbers between 1 and n: $$ I:= \left \{  i \in N : 1 \leq i\leq n \right \} $$ (=>) So, if we assume that the both ordered n-tuple are equal:  $$ \left (x_{i} \right)_{i\in I} = \left (y_{i} \right)_{i\in I} $$ As the two functions are equal (by hypothesis). So for each i in I, we have that both are equal (using the definition of equality of function given in previous chapter by the author). Therefore:  $$  \left (\forall i \in I \right) \left (  x \left ( i \right)= y \left ( i \right) \right) $$ (<=) On the other hand, if we assume that: $$  \left (\forall i \in I \right) \left (  x_{i}= y_{i} \right) $$ As both function have the same domain and range that means both are equal: $$ \left (x_{i} \right)_{i\in I} = \left (y_{i} \right)_{i\in I} $$ *For the second part, I have some troubles but here is my approach: First we write the Cartesian product as the author do: $$ \prod_{i\in I} X_{i} := \left \{ \left (x_{i}  \right )_{i \in I}:\left(\forall i \in I \right) \left (x_{i} \in X_{i} \right)   \right \} $$ I form the set of all the functions from the set of natural numbers called I to a target set X, which I defined in the next way: $$ X^{I} \text{ where } X:= \bigcup_{i \in I} X_{i} $$ Then, using the axiom schema of specification we can form the set: $$ g\in \left \{ f\in  X^{I}  : \left (\forall i \in I \right) \left (f \left ( i \right) \in X_{i} \right)  \right \} \leftrightarrow \\ \left(\text{$g: I \rightarrow X$ is a mapping and } \left (\left (\forall i \in I \right) \left (f \left ( i \right) \in X_{i} \right)  \right ) \right ) $$ So, using the definition given by the author only we need to show that g is onto which means that define an ordered n-tuple (right?). $$ x \in X \leftrightarrow  x \in \bigcup_{i \in I} X_{i}\leftrightarrow \left (\exists i \in I   \right )\left ( x \in  X_{i} \right )  $$ g is surjective because for each x in the target set always we can find a i in the domain. Then, g is an ordered n-tuple. And that means g lies in collection of all n-tuples defined at the first place. On the other hand: $$ x\in \prod_{i\in I} X_{i}\leftrightarrow \left (x = \left (x_{i}  \right )_{i \in I}  \right )\text{ and } \left(\forall i \in I \right) \left (x_{i} \in X_{i} \right) $$ So, that means $x$ is an n-tuple and by hypothesis, $x$ is a surjective function from the set $I$ to $X$. Then, $x$ lies in set formed above. Hence, the Cartesian product is a set. (I'm sorry for my grammatical mistakes, English is not my first language).",,['elementary-set-theory']

15,Doubts on roster notation of sets,Doubts on roster notation of sets,,"Simple examples of sets are often described via roster notation (aka enumeration notation) like $\{0,1,4,9\}$ -  simply write down the elements of the set between the two set delimiters (curly brackets) and separate them by commas. In axiomatic set theory this notation also occurs in the Axiom of Pairing: For any $a$ and $b$ there exists a set $\{a, b\}$ that contains exactly $a$ and $b$ . It is then easy to see that $\{a, b\} =  \{b, a\}$ . More generally one can usually read that ordering and multiple listing of the elements in roster notation is irrelevant, for example we have $\{0,1,2\} = \{1,0,2,1,0\}$ . In axiomatic set theory the concept of an ordered pair $(a,b)$ is not introduced by a separate axiom, but it is somehow defined based on the existing axioms, for example by $(a,b) = \{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}$ . More generally, the concept of an ordered tuple $(a_1,\ldots,a_n)$ can be introduced in that way. Here are my doubts: It seems to me that roster notation is based on an intuitively pre-existing concept of an ordered tuple . Writing down elements sequentially from left to right does not really produce a set, but a tuple. We then have a certain equivalence relation for such tuples which says us when to regard two tuples as the ""same set"". But set theory should not be based on such an intuitive prerequisite. In fact even the axiom of pairing is based on an intuitive concept of a pair. Later re-introducing this concept via a definition seems to be circular. One might argue that $\{a,b\}$ is short for $\{x : x = a \vee x = b\}$ . But even in this notation we actually have a pair of conditions, separated by a $\vee$ instead of a comma. Yes, $x = a \vee x = b$ and $x = b \vee x = a$ are equivalent, but alone to state this fact requires an intuitive understanding of ""ordering"" which axiomatic set theory claims to be reducible to more elementary concepts. In other words: We start with an intuitive concept of pairs or tuples as ingredients of the axioms and later ""cleanly"" re-introduce these concepts using the axioms based on the same (but beforehand unclean) concept. My question: Usually roster notation occurs at the very beginning of texts on set theory. But it involves ingredients which are not really available in a precise sense at that point: Finite sequences of elements, i.e. ordered tuples Permutations of ordered tuples A reduction process eliminating duplicates in tuples One can argue that at the beginning an intuitive understanding of these ingredients is sufficient to get the idea what roster notation means. The precise meaning will be clear after having introduced the necessary ingredients via an axiomatic approach. But the Axiom of Pairing involves roster notation before the above ingredients have been properly defined. Is this a vicious circle? Do we need a new axiomatic approach avoiding this problem?

I think we can safely extend the concept from time to space (actually the question is the same, just that I think many people will find it easier to identify space with the real line).  Then, the original question: The real line has $2^{\aleph_0}$ (which I guess is at most  $\aleph_2$) points. But if we can partition it into a number of intervals of arbitrarily high cardinality, shouldn't the number (or set) of points on it have at least the same cardinality? (or you can have more intervals than points?). I am obviously confused. Please help!!",,"['elementary-set-theory', 'metric-spaces', 'cardinals', 'ordinals']"

EDIT please note that the above paragraph indicates that I know about set cardinality and how it is defined, and accept it as a valid ""size"" definition, but am asking here about something else. To put it another way, the set of integers is a proper subset of the set of rationals. It seems strange to claim that the two sets are equal in size when one is a proper subset of the other. Is there, for example, some alternative named ""size"" definition consistent with the partial ordering given by the is-a-proper-subset-of operator? EDIT clearly it is reasonable to define such a partial order and evaluate it. And while I've use geometric analogies, clearly this is pure set theory - it depends only on the relevant sets sharing members, not on what the sets represent.

Sorry if some of my comments aren't appropriate, but this is pretty frustrating. As I said, it feels like I'm violating some kind of taboo. EDIT - I was browsing through random stuff when I was reminded this was here, and that I actually ran into an example where ""size"" clearly can't mean ""cardinality"" fairly recently (actually a very long time ago and many times since, but I didn't notice the connection until recently). The example relates to closures of sets. Please forgive any wrong terminology, but if I have a seed set of {0} and an operation $f x = x+2$ , the closure of that set WRT that operation is the ""smallest"" set that is closed WRT that operation, meaning that for any member $x$ of the set, $x+2$ must also be a member. So obviously the closure is {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, ...} - the even non-negative integers. However, the cardinality of the set of even non-negative integers is equal to the cardinality of the set of all integers, or even all rationals. So if ""smallest"" means ""least cardinality"", the closure isn't well-defined - the set {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, ...} is no larger than the set {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, ...}. Therefore, the meaning of ""smallest"" WRT set closures refers to some measure of size other than cardinality. I'm not adding this as a late answer because it's already covered by the answers below - it's just a particular example that makes sense to me. Another addition - while skimming the first chapter of a topology textbook in a library some time ago, IIRC I spotted a definition of the set closure which did not use the word ""smallest"", and made no direct reference to ""size"". That led me to think maybe the common ""definition"" of closures I'm familiar with is just a stopgap for those of us who aren't ready for a formally precise definition. However, while searching for another source, I instead found this answer to a topology question that uses the word ""smallest"" in its definition of closure (and ""largest"" in its ""dual definition of interior"").

But, as I understand it, the word ""subset"" means a set within another set. So, intuitively if A is in B It would mean that B is {{1,2},3} This would mean that {1,2,3} and {{1,2},3}  and {1,{2,3}} are the same set as brackets would be arbitrary ways of grouping elements in subsets within the set. This is generally the way we understand and draw sets as circles within circles. Circles are drawn depending on how we want to group the content but they have no substance in and on themselves. This is also backed up by the fact that two identical elements are the same element, and by that token, subset A is entirely inside the set B. But when looking at cardinalities, it seems those 3 sets are very different as {1,2,3} has a cardinality of 3 while {{1,2},3} and {1,{2,3}} have a cardinality of 2. If they were the same set, their cardinalities would be ambiguous. Therefore, they aren't the same set. So, I conclude that I am wrong in the way I see subsets as subsets are NOT sets within sets, they are just sets which content is also included in another set. Right?

96,Set intersection the same as logical conjunction?,Set intersection the same as logical conjunction?,,I have been exploring more about set theory beyond my textbook and I have ran into something I couldn't explain. Can you use logical conjunction/disjunction on sets and are they the same as union/intersection? A $\bigcap$ B A $\wedge$ B where A and B are sets. Are these equivalent? What does the disjunction or two sets mean?,I have been exploring more about set theory beyond my textbook and I have ran into something I couldn't explain.

With this is mind, does there exist some well ordered set $(B,\leq)$ with some special element $b$ such that the set of all elements smaller than $b$ is uncountable, but for any element besides $b$, the set of all elements smaller is countable (by countable I include finite too). More formally stated, how can one show the existence of a well ordered set $(B,\leq)$ such that there exists a $b\in B$ such that $\{a\in X\mid a\lt b\}$ is uncountable, but $\{a\in X\mid a\lt c\}$ is countable for all $c\neq b$?

99,Real numbers and countability,Real numbers and countability,,"No subset of the real numbers is countable. True or false. In looking at the wikipedia article for real numbers, I'm not really clear on the answer to this. They use the words computable and countable, and I'm not sure of the difference. Also, I dont think I fully understand the term countable. The definition states that a set is countable if it has the same cardinality as some subset of the natural numbers, but I'm not sure what that means.","No subset of the real numbers is countable.
