Thanks","I need to do that using $$\sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}}\frac{1}{(z-n)^2}=\left(\frac{\pi}{\sin \pi z}\right)^2$$ I've already prove that this is true. The thing is that this function in meromorphic and it's poles are $\mathbb{Z}$. So the natural evauation in $0$ is not possible. I tried to think of a way to do it with that using that the singular part of this function in $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ is $\frac{1}{(z-n)^2}$, but could find a way. What I was looking was sort of substract the term where $n=0$ and divide by $2$. For the second sum, I didn't find a clear way. The natural evaluation in $n^2-n$ is not possible since $n$ varies in the sum. Thanks",,"['complex-analysis', 'meromorphic-functions']"

Am I just missing something here?","So I am a little stumped here, and it could be simple. I'm just not exactly sure how to approach this. The question reads: Find $\omega_0$ in the set of Complex numbers, such that the substitution $z = \omega - \omega_0$ reduces the cubic equation $z^3 + Az^2 + Bz +C = 0$ into $\omega^3 -m\omega -n =0$ ... where I'm assuming those constants are real numbers. My first attempt was to just do a straight substitution of $z= \omega - \omega_0$ into the first equation, then expand it, and try to solve that down for what $\omega_0$ should be, but I started to realize that that's probably not the way.

However, I'm more than open to books that will go further into geometry, trig, algebra, or calculus if they are worth the read in your mind.
