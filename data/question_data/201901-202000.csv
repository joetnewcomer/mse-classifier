0,In what a sense we we can understand a geometric space well by understanding the functions on this space?,In what a sense we we can understand a geometric space well by understanding the functions on this space?,,"The following is from Vakil’s notes page 99. we can understand a geometric space (such as a manifold) well by   understanding the functions on this space. More precisely, we will   understand it through the sheaf of functions on the space. If we are   interested in differentiable manifolds, we will consider   differentiable functions; if we are interested in smooth manifolds, we   will consider smooth functions; and so on. I know some basic notions of diffrential manifolds and know nothing about scheme, and I couldn’t come up with an good example illustrating the above slogan, which says we could understand a space by understanding the functions on the space.

It seems necessary to figure out these questions in order to have a good understanding about how the slogan works as well as why understanding the space in that way is a natural consideration.

Let $g$ be a metric on $N$ . If $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ are local coordinates on $M$ and $N$ respectively then the metric takes the form: $$g=g_{ij}dy^i\otimes dy^j,\;\;\;\;\;i,j=1,\ldots,m.$$ How can one define the pullback of $g$ given that I know the pullback of 2-forms (and $k$ -forms in general)? My Try Lets work with 2 forms for simplicity.

Now suppose that $\alpha=\beta\otimes\gamma$ where $\beta,\gamma$ are 1-forms on $N$ . Using the above I can define the map $$F^*(\beta\otimes\gamma)(v_1,v_2)=(\beta\otimes\gamma)(F_*v_1,F_*v_2)=\beta(F_*v_1)\cdot\gamma(F_*v_2).$$ But $\beta(F_*v_1)=F^*\beta(v_1)$ and $\gamma(F_*v_2)=F^*\gamma(v_2)$ and $$ (F^*\beta\otimes F^*\gamma)(v_1,v_2)=F^*\beta(v_1)\cdot F^*\gamma(v_2)$$ so that I get $$ F^*(\beta\otimes\gamma)=F^*\beta\otimes F^*\gamma.$$ Which looks like a 2-form on $M$ .
