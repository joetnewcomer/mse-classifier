And such that $\sqrt[a]b$ is not an integer (perfect squares or perfect cubes). However , there are continued fractions which can represent some of these numbers, such as $\sqrt5$: $$\sqrt5 = 2+ \frac{1}{4 + \frac{1}{4 + \frac{1}{4 + \frac{1}{4 + \frac{1}{4 + \frac{1}{4 + ...}}}}}}$$ This wikipedia section discusses this concept nicely: Click here SO MY QUESTION IS: If there is a continued fraction for $\sqrt x$, then how do we go from the continued fraction to an infinite sum? (Conversion maybe?) Let's take $\sqrt5$ as an example: How I thought of doing this, would to work out rational approximations by taking the continued fraction to certain terms (T), such as: T1 = $2 = \frac{2}{1}$ T2 = $2+ \frac{1}{4} = \frac{9}{4} = 2,25$ T3 = $2+ \frac{1}{4 + \frac{1}{4}} = \frac{38}{17} = 2,234294118...$ T4 = $2+ \frac{1}{4 + \frac{1}{4+\frac{1}{4}}} = \frac{161}{72} = 2,236111111...$ T5 = $2+ \frac{1}{4 + \frac{1}{4+\frac{1}{4+\frac{1}{4}}}} = \frac{682}{305} = 2,236065574...$ T(n) = $\frac{T_{n+1}(OEIS: A001077)}{T_{n+1}(OEIS: A001076)}$ and the list goes on (if we did this ""infinitely"" many times we should theoretically reach $\sqrt5$ and that is what we are looking for :) Then what I tried to do is take these rational approximations and finding the difference between them, so we could then write it as an infinite sum, comprising of adding the differences (D) of these rational approximations. $D1 = T2-T1 = \frac{9}{4} - 2 = \frac{1}{4}$ $D2 = T3-T2 = \frac{38}{17} - \frac{9}{4} = -\frac{1}{68}$ $D3 = T4-T3 = \frac{161}{72} - \frac{38}{17} = \frac{1}{1224}$ $D4 = T5-T4 = \frac{682}{305} - \frac{161}{72} = -\frac{1}{21960}$ The numerator stays 1 and the denominators continue in the following sequence: https://oeis.org/A156084 (Each time the term alternates between being positive and negative).

And such that $\sqrt[a]b$ is not an integer (perfect squares or perfect cubes).

Why?,,"I've noticed that the reciprocal of many prime numbers have a curious number of digits. For example. 1/7 has 6 repeating digits, 1/17 has 16 repeating digits, and 1/47 has 46.

42,Limit of $\frac{2^n}{n!}$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$,Limit of  as,\frac{2^n}{n!} n \rightarrow \infty,"Very simple question. I'm calculating the limit of $\frac{2^n}{n!}$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$.

48,Dual of $\ell_{\infty}$ is not $\ell_1$,Dual of  is not,\ell_{\infty} \ell_1,"As the title indicates I'm trying to show that $\ell_{\infty}^{*}$ is not $\ell_1$. I've shown that for p, q conjugate and finite we do indeed have $\ell_{p}^{*} = \ell_q$, with the correspondence between $y_i = \phi(e_i)\in \ell_{q}$ and $\phi$ where $e_i$ is the standard (0,....,0,1,0,....) with a 1 in the 'i'th place and $\phi \in \ell_{p}^{*}$. However, I gather the reason this falls apart in the infinite case is that the dual $\ell_{\infty}^{*}$ is far larger than (but contains) $\ell_1$, being in fact the set of bounded sequences eventually tending to 0. However, I'm having some trouble seeing this. In theory, I'm working over $\mathbb{C}$, but I don't think that's where my issue is arising. It's certainly obvious that $\ell_1$ is contained in $\ell_{\infty}^{*}$: $\sum_i |y_i| < \infty \Rightarrow |\phi(x)| = |\sum_i y_i x_i| \leq (\sum_i |y_i|)(\|x\|_{\infty})$ so $\|\phi\| \le \sum_i |y_i| < \infty$: but then this is my problem, how do we get anything which corresponds to a sequence of $y_i$ -not- in $\ell_1$? I don't think working in the reals is an issue but perhaps I'm overlooking something, so suppose (e.g.) $y_i = \frac{1}{i}$: unless I've misunderstood, this should correspond to a functional since the $y_i$ are bounded and tend to 0, i.e. $\phi(e_i) = \frac{1}{i}$ and extend linearly. But if this is the case, then surely x=(1,1,1,...) gives us an x with norm 1 ($\|x\|_{\infty} = 1$) and for which $\phi$ is unbounded? So in that case this sequence of $y_i$ is a bounded sequence tending to 0 which does not in this way correspond to a bounded linear operator: or is the correspondence no longer in the obvious way? Surely no matter how you look at it each functional gives rise to a sequence of $y_i$, and unless i've confused myself these $y_i$ must be in the space $\ell_1$, which is wrong.
