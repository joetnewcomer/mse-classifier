0,Homework: closed 1-forms on $S^2$ are exact.,Homework: closed 1-forms on  are exact.,S^2,"From the 2008 UCLA Geometry-Topology qualifying exam: let $\theta$ be a $1$-form on $S^2$ with $d \theta = 0$. Construct a function $f$ on $S^2$ with $d f = \theta$. I'm not very confident in my ability to answer even a basic problem like this properly, and I'd appreciate someone telling me if I'm mistaken in my reasoning. I argued as follows: let $U$ be the subset $S^2\setminus\{\text{south pole}\}$ and $L=S^2\setminus\{\text{north pole}\}$.       Since these subsets are diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^2$ via stereographic projection, the restriction of $\theta$ to either one of $U$ or $L$ is exact.       Thus there exist $f_U$ and $f_L$ so that $d f_U = \theta , d f_L = \theta$ on $U,L$ respectively. On the intersection $U\cap L$ we have $d f_U = d f_L$, that is $d(f_U-f_L) = 0$.       This forces $f_U = f_L + c$ for some constant $c$ on their common intersection.       The existence and choice for $f$ are now apparent: let $f=f_U$ on $U$ and $f(\text{south pole}) = f_L(\text{south pole})+c$.","From the 2008 UCLA Geometry-Topology qualifying exam: let $\theta$ be a $1$-form on $S^2$ with $d \theta = 0$.

Given Akhil's reply I think I should try to understand the connection invariance proof better and here goes my partial attempt. Let $\nabla$ be the connection on the manifold $(M,g)$ and $\nabla '$ be the Riemann connection on the manifold $(M',g')$ and between these two let $\phi$ be the isometry. Then one wants to show two things, $D\phi [\nabla _ X Y] = \nabla ' _{D\phi[X]} D\phi [Y]$ $R(X,Y)Z = R'(D\phi [X],D\phi [Y]) D\phi [Z]$ Where $R$ and $R'$ are the Riemann connection on $(M,g)$ and $(M',g')$ respectively. One defines the map $\nabla ''$ on M which maps two vector fields on M to another vector field using $\nabla '' _X Y = D\phi ^{-1} (\nabla' _{D\phi[X]} D\phi [Y]$. By the uniqueness of the Riemann connection the proof is complete if one can show that this $\nabla ''$ satisfies all the conditions of being a Riemann connection on M. I am getting stuck after a few steps while trying to show the Lebnitz property of $\nabla ''$. Let $f$ be some smooth function on M and then one would like to show that, $\nabla '' _X fY = X(f)Y + f\nabla '' _X Y$ which is equivalent to showing that, $D\phi ^{-1} (\nabla' _{D\phi[X]} D\phi [fY]) = X(f) + f D\phi ^{-1} (\nabla' _{D\phi[X]} D\phi [Y])$ knowing that $\nabla '$ satisfies the Leibniz property on $M'$.

Then one wants to show two things, $D\phi [\nabla _ X Y] = \nabla ' _{D\phi[X]} D\phi [Y]$ $R(X,Y)Z = R'(D\phi [X],D\phi [Y]) D\phi [Z]$ Where $R$ and $R'$ are the Riemann connection on $(M,g)$ and $(M',g')$ respectively. One defines the map $\nabla ''$ on M which maps two vector fields on M to another vector field using $\nabla '' _X Y = D\phi ^{-1} (\nabla' _{D\phi[X]} D\phi [Y]$. By the uniqueness of the Riemann connection the proof is complete if one can show that this $\nabla ''$ satisfies all the conditions of being a Riemann connection on M. I am getting stuck after a few steps while trying to show the Lebnitz property of $\nabla ''$. Let $f$ be some smooth function on M and then one would like to show that, $\nabla '' _X fY = X(f)Y + f\nabla '' _X Y$ which is equivalent to showing that, $D\phi ^{-1} (\nabla' _{D\phi[X]} D\phi [fY]) = X(f) + f D\phi ^{-1} (\nabla' _{D\phi[X]} D\phi [Y])$ knowing that $\nabla '$ satisfies the Leibniz property on $M'$. Some how I am not being able to unwrap the above to prove this. I can get the second term of the equation but not the first one. Proving symmetry of $\nabla ''$ is easy but again proving metric compatibility is stuck for me. If $X,Y,Z$ are 3 vector fields on M then one would want to show that, $Xg(Y,Z) = g(\nabla ''_X Y,Z) + g(Y, \nabla '' _X Z)$ which is equivalent to showing that, $Xg(Y,Z) = g(D\phi ^{-1} (\nabla' _{D\phi[X]} D\phi [Y]),Z) + g(Y,D\phi ^{-1} (\nabla' _{D\phi[X]} D\phi [Z]) )$ knowing that $\nabla'$ satisfies metric compatibility equation on $M'$ It would be helpful if someone can help me fill in the steps. Then one is left with proving the curvature endomorphism equation.",,['differential-geometry']

Setup: Let $E\rightarrow M$ be a Hermitian holomorphic bundle, $S\subset E$ be a holomorphic subbundle and $Q=E/S$ be the quotient bundle. Q can be seen in  unitary frames to be diffeomorphic to $S^{\perp}$. Hence $S$ and $Q$ are both Hermitian. Let $D_E$, $D_S$ and $D_Q$ be the connections compatible with the complex structures (Compatibility with the metric and vanishing on holomorphic sections). By uniqueness of such connections, $D_S=\pi_S\circ (D_E|_{A^0(S)})$ where $A^0(S)$ are sections of $S$. Now $A:=D_E|_{A^0(S)} -D_S$ is $C^\infty (M)$ linear and maps to sections in $S^{\perp}=Q$ with coefficients in $A^{(1,0)}(M)$ (Because of the definition of a connection and the compatibility conditions on $D_E$ and $D_S$). In short, $A\in A^{(1,0)}(Hom(S,Q))$. Now, as in G-H, choosing a unitary frame ${e_i}$ for E (the first few vectors of which form a frame for $S$) we see that the matrix of forms for $D_E$ is $\theta_E = \begin{bmatrix} \theta_S & A^* \\ A & \theta_Q \end{bmatrix}$. Remark 1: The above formula is incorrect since in a unitary frame $\theta_E = -\theta_E^*$. So we should have a $-$ sign along with the $A^*$. Question 1: Is this correct? Assuming this, the correct formulas are: $\theta_E = \begin{bmatrix} \theta_S & -A^* \\ A & \theta_Q \end{bmatrix}$, $\Theta_S=\Theta_E|_{S}-A^*\wedge A$, $\Theta_Q=\Theta_E|_Q-A\wedge A^*$.

Here, I assume we are fixing a local unitary frame, evaluating the coefficients of (1,1)-forms of $\Theta(x)$ on $(v,\bar v)$ and then looking at the resulting matrix in $Hom(E_x,E_x)$. Claim 1: is that $\Theta_Q \geq \Theta_E|_Q$, i.e. curvature increases in quotient bundles. Using the corrected formula, we want to show $-A\wedge A^*$ is positive. Note, a computation shows (by definition?) $-A\wedge A^*$ is in $A^{(1,1)}(Hom(Q_x,Q_x))$ and the $(p,q)$ entry is $-\sum_{\alpha,\beta} \sum_k a_{pk}^\alpha \bar{a}_{qk}^\beta dz_\alpha\wedge d\bar{z}_\beta$. And following G-H, contracting with $(\partial{z_\alpha},\partial{\bar z_\alpha})$ gives the matrix $-A^\alpha {A^*}^\alpha$ in $Hom(Q_x,Q_x)$ and they conclude that this proves positivity. Question 2: Since I am Un Idiota and the most I can do is follow instructions, I am assuming they are checking (as required by the definition) that $-i(-A^\alpha {A^*}^\alpha)$ is hermitian positive definite.

The problem says: Formulate and prove a version of the rank theorem for a map of constant rank whose domain is a smooth manifold with boundary. Lee himself gave a hint in another question . Here is what I have so far: I'm assuming I have a smooth map of constant rank $F: \mathbb{H}^m\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n$ . Let's say $\mathrm{rank}(F)=k$ . Then I extend $F$ to a smooth map $\tilde{F}:\mathbb{R}^m\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n$ .  I can shrink the domain to a small enough neighborhood of $\mathbf{0}$ , $U$ , such that there is a projection $\pi:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^k$ with $\pi\tilde{F}_{|U}$ a submersion. The actual constant-rank theorem then says we have charts $(A,\alpha)$ and $(B,\beta)$ with $$ \beta\circ\pi\tilde{F}\circ\alpha^{-1}:\alpha(A)\rightarrow\beta(B)$$ If I write the coordinates of $\mathbb{H}^m$ as $(x,y)$ and the coordinates of of $\alpha(A)$ as $(a,t)$ , then this map looks like $$ \beta\circ\pi\tilde{F}\circ\alpha^{-1}(a,t) = a$$ I can switch the order so the projection is the last map applied: $$ \pi\circ(\beta\times\mathrm{id})\circ\tilde{F}\circ\alpha^{-1}\equiv\beta\circ\pi\tilde{F}\circ\alpha^{-1}$$ Which finally means $$(\beta\times\mathrm{id})\circ\tilde{F}\circ\alpha^{-1}(a,t)=(a,S(a,t))$$ Where $S:\alpha(A)\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{(n-k)}$ . This is pretty similar to how the constant-rank theorem is proved, but now I'm stuck.  The map above, restricted to $\alpha(A\cap\mathbb{H}^m)$ , has rank $k$ . But that does not mean $S$ is independent of $y$ . That's because $\alpha$ is not necessarily a boundary chart on $A\cap\mathbb{H}^m$ . I also don't see any way to make $\alpha$ a boundary chart (something similar is proved in Lee's book, but crucially uses that $F$ is an immersion).

I can then define the Lie derivative along $X_t$ as: $$\mathcal{L}_{X_t}\omega=\frac{d}{ds}(\phi^s)^\ast\omega\Big|_{s=0}.$$ But then, as the poster of the question I found this morning (second link) notices, $\mathcal{L}_{X_t}$ seems to be independent of $t$, i.e. for all $t,s\in\mathbb{R}$ it seems $\mathcal{L}_{X_t}=\mathcal{L}_{X_s}$ as an operator.

Let us try to compute the Fubini-Study metric in inhomogeneous coordinates on $\mathbb{C} P^n$,  using the Hopf fibration. For simplicity, let us do $n=1$. Start with $\mathbb{C}^2$. In the standard coordinates $(Z_0, Z_1)$, the standard flat metric is given by $g= dZ_0\,d\overline{Z_0} + dZ_1\,d\overline{Z_1}$. This metric restricts to the round metric on the unit sphere $S^3$ seen as $S^3 = \{|Z_0|^2 + |Z_1|^2 = 1\}$. The group of unit complex numbers $U(1)$ acts on $S^3$ by multiplication, and the quotient is the complex projective line $\mathbb{C}P^1$. (Note that this is the Hopf fibration $S^1 \to S^3 \to S^2$). In homogeneous coordinates $[Z_0 \colon Z_1]$ on $\mathbb{C}P^1$, the projection map $\pi \colon S^3 \to \mathbb{C}P^1$ is just $(Z_0, Z_1) \mapsto [Z_0 \colon Z_1]$. In the inhomogeneous coordinate $z = Z_1/Z_0$ (such that $[Z_0 \colon Z_1] = [1 \colon z]$), the projection map is $(Z_0, Z_1) \mapsto z = Z_1/Z_0$.

This metric on $\mathbb{C}P^1$ is the Fubini-Study metric. In order to compute it, we can use any local section $s \colon \mathbb{C}P^1 \to S^3$, for instance: $$s(z) = \left(Z_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+z\overline{z}}}, Z_1 = \frac{z}{\sqrt{1+z\overline{z}}}\right)~.$$ The Fubini-Study metric in the coordinate $z$ will simply be given by the pull-back metric $g_{FS} := s^* g = dZ_0\,d\overline{Z_0} + dZ_1\,d\overline{Z_1}$ where $Z_0$ and $Z_1$ denote (somewhat abusively) the functions of $z$ given by the definition of $s(z)$ as above. A direct computation gives: $$dZ_0 = \frac{-\overline{z}\,dz - z\,d\overline{z}}{2(1+z\overline{z})^{3/2}}$$ $$dZ_1 = \frac{(2+z\overline{z})\,dz - z^2 \,d\overline{z}}{2(1+z\overline{z})^{3/2}}$$  which yields $$dZ_0\,d\overline{Z_0} + dZ_1\,d\overline{Z_1} = \frac{-\overline{z}^2\,dz^2 - z^2\,d\overline{z}^2 + 2(2+z\overline{z})\,dz\,d\overline{z}}{4\,(1+z\overline{z})^2}$$ The problem is that this is not what is expected: instead we expect $$g_{FS} = \frac{dz\,d\overline{z}}{(1+z\overline{z})^{2}}~.$$ Where have I gone wrong?","Someone asked this question recently and then deleted it, but I still would like to figure out the answer.

A direct computation gives: $$dZ_0 = \frac{-\overline{z}\,dz - z\,d\overline{z}}{2(1+z\overline{z})^{3/2}}$$ $$dZ_1 = \frac{(2+z\overline{z})\,dz - z^2 \,d\overline{z}}{2(1+z\overline{z})^{3/2}}$$  which yields $$dZ_0\,d\overline{Z_0} + dZ_1\,d\overline{Z_1} = \frac{-\overline{z}^2\,dz^2 - z^2\,d\overline{z}^2 + 2(2+z\overline{z})\,dz\,d\overline{z}}{4\,(1+z\overline{z})^2}$$ The problem is that this is not what is expected: instead we expect $$g_{FS} = \frac{dz\,d\overline{z}}{(1+z\overline{z})^{2}}~.$$ Where have I gone wrong?",,"['differential-geometry', 'riemannian-geometry', 'complex-geometry', 'projective-space', 'kahler-manifolds']"

93,Does every manifold admit a *flat* Riemannian metric?,Does every manifold admit a *flat* Riemannian metric?,,"It is well-known that every smooth manifold $M$ admits a Riemannian metric, and the construction is straightforward. Let $\left\{U_\alpha, \phi_\alpha\right\}$ be a smooth atlas on $M$ admitting a partition of unity $\left\{\psi_\alpha\right\}$ . On each coordinate chart $U_\alpha$ , we can define a Riemannian metric $g_\alpha$ locally by setting $g_\alpha = \phi_\alpha^*\overline g$ , where $\overline g$ is the Euclidean metric on $\mathbb R^n$ . Using the partition of unity, we can construct a global Riemannian metric by setting $g = \sum_\alpha \psi_\alpha g_\alpha$ . My first question is: Is this metric flat? I believe the answer is no. A metric is flat iff for each point there is a coordinate chart that is locally isometric to Euclidean space.
