0,Constant sheaves on the étale site of a scheme,Constant sheaves on the étale site of a scheme,,"I am learning étale cohomology with Tamme's book. When talking about example of abelian sheaves on the étale site, he mentions the following equality for an abelian group $A$ : let $A_X$ be the constant sheaf associated to $A$ on the étale site of $X$ and $X^{'}\to X$ an étale morphism of schemes, then $A_X(X^{'})=\mathrm{Hom}_X(X^{'},\coprod_A X)=\prod_{\text{connected components of $X^{'}$}} A$ Now I checked the first equality, but I don't see how the second equality follows when the connected components of $X^{'}$ are not open. A related question to this is, what are sufficient conditions that ensure that every étale $X$ -scheme has finitely many connected components ? It is necessary that $X$ has finitely many connected components, is it also sufficient ? To reformulate, we can, by pulling back to a connected component of $X$ , ask the following : if $X$ is a connected scheme, does every étale $X$ -scheme have finitely many connected components ? I suspect it is false, I think we can look for a connected scheme with an open subscheme that has infinitely many connected components (that is something similar to $\mathbf{Q}\subset\mathbf{R}$ ), but the counterexample must lie outside the noetherian world and so also out of my comfort zone. What about when X is noetherian ?

Here $\theta = 0, \frac{\pi}{4}$ and $k = 2$ . Here is the picture of the quadrifolium, a kind of rose curve , and when it's rotated.

We're trying to describe $X(\mathbb{Q})$ . The curve on the left right has no rational points. Naively, if I divide one equation by the other, I get an expression for the tangent function.  In fact, $\frac{x}{y} = \tan \theta$ for all values of $\theta \in [0, 2\pi]$ just as if it were a circle.

Is this sufficient?  Is this map birational, is this enough for a paramerization? Here is even another strategy, since we have Fourier series (even just trigonometric series because there are only 4 terms). $$ \left[ \begin{array}{c} x \\ y \end{array}\right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c}  e^{3i\theta} + e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} + e^{-3i\theta} \\ e^{3i\theta} - e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} - e^{-3i\theta}\end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{rrrr} 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 & 1 & -1 \end{array} \right] \left[ \begin{array}{c} e^{3i\theta} \\ e^{i\theta} \\ e^{-i\theta} \\ e^{-3i\theta} \end{array} \right]  $$ Or we could even try a different approach using the triple-angle formulas of trigonometry: \begin{eqnarray*} \cos 3\theta &=& 4 \cos^3 \theta - 3 \cos \theta \\ \sin 3\theta &=& 3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta \\ \tan 3\theta &=& \frac{3 \tan \theta - \tan^3 \theta}{1 - 3 \tan^2 \theta} \end{eqnarray*} Now these are reading as a degree-map from the circle to another algebraic variety (or scheme).

Here is the situation and the claim that Hartshorne does: Let $f\colon X\to Y$ be a morphism between $X$ a complete nonsingular curve and $Y$ any curve such that $f(X)=Y$. We know then that $Y$ is also complete (but may be singular) and that $f$ induces a finite field extension $K(Y)\subseteq K(X)$ between the fraction fields. Goal: $f$ is a finite morphism, i.e. the preimage of an affine open $\operatorname{Spec}{B}$ is an affine open $\operatorname{Spec}{A}$ such that the induced ring morphism makes $A$ a finite $B$-module. So let $V=\operatorname{Spec}{B}$ be an affine open of $Y$ (potentially with some singularities). Regard $B$ as a subring of $K(X)$ (via the identification with $f$) and let $A$ be the integral closure of $B$ in $K(X)$. Then $A$ is a Dedekind domain, finite $B$-module, with fraction field $K(X)$. $U=\operatorname{Spec}{A}$ is a nonsingular curve with fraction field $K(X)$, hence canonically an open subscheme of $X$ (because complete nonsingular curves are canonically isomorphic to the abstract complete nonsingular curve, whose closed points are the dvr's in the corresponding field). Hartshorne claims then that clearly $f^{-1}(V)=U$, but I fail to see why, let alone why this is at all so clear. My attempt: the valuation rings of a field containing a Dedekind domain are precisely the localization of this Dedekind domain at the different non-zero prime ideals. Hence a closed point $P\in X$ is a non-zero prime ideal of $A$ if and only if $\mathcal{O}_{X,P}\supseteq A$, and since $A$ is the integral closure of $B$ in $K(X)$, this is the case if and only if $\mathcal{O}_{X,P}\supseteq B$. But this means precisely that the prime $P$ lies over some prime of $B$ under the identification done via $f$, hence that $P\in f^{-1}(V)$. Is this proof correct?

23,Deformation theory formalism,Deformation theory formalism,,"I just started reading Hartshorne's ""Deformation theory"" book and occasionally I get confused by the way he treats various objects (and it seems like it is common in the literature overall, e.g. in the literature on the moduli spaces of sheaves). A typical example would be as follows ( theorem 2.7 in the book): Given a scheme $X$ over $k$ with a coherent sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ we call a (first-order) deformation of $\mathcal{F}$ over $D=Spec \ k[t]/t^2$ the data of a coherent sheaf $\mathcal{F}'$ over $X'=X\times D$, flat over D, together with a homomorphism $\mathcal{F}' \to \mathcal{F}$ which induces an isomorphism $\mathcal{F}' \otimes k \to \mathcal{F}$. Then the statement is that such deformations are in one-to-one correspondence with $\text{Ext}_{X}^{1} (\mathcal{F},\mathcal{F}).$ The very first line of the proof says the following: flatness of $\mathcal{F}'$ over $D$ is equivalent to the exactness of $$0\to \mathcal{F} \xrightarrow{t} \mathcal{F}' \to \mathcal{F} \to 0 $$obtained by tensoring $\mathcal{F}'$ with $0 \to k \xrightarrow{t} k[t]/t^2 \to k \to 0$. Now the question is: what does it mean to tensor a sheaf of $\mathcal{O}_{X'}$-modules with a $k[t]/t^2$ module (not even a sheaf)? There are various ways I tried to make sense of it in a more sheaf-theoretic way, namely: Change the ringed space structure on $X'$ by replacing $\mathcal{O}_{X'}$ with constant sheaf of rings $k[t]/t^2$, interpret $\mathcal{F}'$ as a sheaf of $k[t]/t^2$ modules and treat $k[t]/t^2,k$ as constant sheaves of $k[t]/t^2$ modules on $X'$. Then interpret $\mathcal{F}' \otimes k[t]/t^2, \mathcal{F}' \otimes k$ in the usual way as a tensor product of sheaves of $k[t]/t^2$ modules. Then probably run this machine back and check that the resulting sheaves are actually sheaves of $\mathcal{O}_{X'}$ modules. Seems like a very round-about way of doing things, and seems like it is becoming more and more clumsy if we are taking higher order deformations, or even an arbitrary Artin ring to deform over. More naively, interpret say $(\mathcal{F}' \otimes k) \ (U) = \mathcal{F}' (U) \otimes k$, check that it is a sheaf and check that it has whatever structure you are interested in (sheaf of $\mathcal{O}_{X'}, \mathcal{O}_{X}, k[t]/t^2$-modules, etc.) Seems like a nice shortcut way, but it also seems like certain functoriality properties are not so clear anymore, so that the existence of certain maps, behavior under exact sequences, etc. should now be separately checked locally on an open set. After all I think that the above two interpretations and actually all other conceivable interpretations give the same answer.

25,Deciding whether the maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}R_\mathfrak{m}$ is generated by two elements,Deciding whether the maximal ideal  is generated by two elements,\mathfrak{m}R_\mathfrak{m},"Let $\phi$ be a ring homomorphism $\mathbb{C}[x,y,z] \to \mathbb{C}[s,t]$ such that $\phi(x) = s,\ \phi(y) = st,$ and $\phi(z) = t^2.$ Let $R = \operatorname{Im}\phi.$ Let $(a,b,c)\in\mathbb{C}^3$ and suppose $\mathfrak{m} = (s-a,st-b,t^2-c)$ is a maximal ideal of $R.$ The question asks me to find all $(a,b,c) \in \mathbb{C}^3$ such that the ideal $\mathfrak{m}R_\mathfrak{m}$ is not generated by two elements. These have been my ideas so far: First of all, by the first isomorphism theorem, $$R \cong \mathbb{C}[x,y,z]/(y^2-x^2z).$$ The ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ then corresponds to the ideal $(x-a,y-b,z-c)$ in $\mathbb{C}[x,y,z].$ Certainly, $\mathfrak{m}R_\mathfrak{m}$ is generated by at most $3$ elements, as the images of the generators of $\mathfrak{m}$ will generate $\mathfrak{m}R_\mathfrak{m}.$ So we need to find $(a,b,c)$ such that $\mathfrak{m}R_\mathfrak{m}$ is principal or generated by three elements. By Krull's height theorem, if $\mathrm{ht}(\mathfrak{m}R_\mathfrak{m}) \geq 2,$ then $\mathfrak{m}R_\mathfrak{m}$ cannot be principal, as the height of a proper ideal is bounded above by the number of generators of that ideal. Furthermore, $\mathrm{ht}(\mathfrak{m}R_\mathfrak{m}) = \mathrm{ht}(\mathfrak{m})$ as the localisation gives us a bijection between prime ideals of $R$ contained in $\mathfrak{m}$ and prime ideals of $R_\mathfrak{m}.$ As commented above, $\mathfrak{m}$ corresponds to the ideal $(x-a,y-b,z-c)$ in $\mathbb{C}[x,y,z],$ so we need to consider the prime ideals $\mathfrak{p} \subset \mathbb{C}[x,y,z]$ such that $(y^2-x^2z) \subseteq \mathfrak{p} \subseteq (x-a,y-b,z-c).$ For example, if we consider $(a,b,c) = (0,0,0),$ we would have the following chain of ideals in $\mathbb{C}[x,y,z]:$ $$(y^2-x^2z) \subsetneq (x,y) \subsetneq (x,y,z),$$ so $(x,y,z)$ has height at least $2$ , hence the corresponding maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}R_\mathfrak{m}$ cannot be principal. However, this method still doesn't allow me to decide whether $(x,y,z)$ has two or three generators in the localisation. Also, for $(a,b,c) \neq (0,0,0),$ I'm not sure how to find the height of the ideal $(s-a,st-b,t^2-c).$ Of course, I'm not even sure if this method is the correct method (as the height only gives the lower bound for the number of generators). If anybody has better ideas or any hints, it'd be much appreciated! EDIT: I realised I can actually show that all the prime ideals of $\mathbb{C}[s,t]$ are generated by at most $2$ elements, so $\mathfrak{m}$ is generated by at most two elements. So I guess this means we just need to decide whether $\mathfrak{m}R_\mathfrak{m}$ is principal or not? EDIT2: Actually, a prime ideal in $R$ isn't necessarily prime in $\mathbb{C}[s,t],$ so I guess the above doesn't quite work. EDIT3: I feel like I have a possible solution. It'd be great if somebody could check them! Possible solution: Let $d$ be the minimal number of generators of $\mathfrak{n} = \mathfrak{m}R_\mathfrak{m}.$ Then by Nakayama's Lemma, $d$ is also the minimal number of generators of $\mathfrak{n}/\mathfrak{n}^2.$ So $d = \dim_{R/\mathfrak{m}}\mathfrak{n}/\mathfrak{n}^2.$ Note that the image of $\{x-a,y-b,z-c\}$ in $R_\mathfrak{m}$ generate $\mathfrak{n},$ so $\{(x-a)^2,(y-b^2),(z-c)^2,(x-a)(y-b),(y-b)(z-c),(z-c)(x-a)\}$ generate $\mathfrak{n}^2.$ I'm going to try to show that $d=3.$ Suppose $u(x-a)+v(y-b)+w(z-c) \in \mathfrak{n}^2$ for $u,v,w\in R/\mathfrak{m} \cong \mathbb{C}.$ The equation above is linear, so we cannot have the square generators (such as $(x-a)^2$ ). But every other generator contains $xy$ , $yz$ , or $zx,$ which isn't possible. So $u=v=w=0.$ So the three generators (modulo $\mathfrak{n}^2$ ) are linearly independent, hence $d=3$ . So no choice of $(a,b,c)$ works.","Let be a ring homomorphism such that and Let Let and suppose is a maximal ideal of The question asks me to find all such that the ideal is not generated by two elements.

Is there some more general definition of rank that would make this well-defined for an arbitrary noetherian scheme $X$? Or does he mean the largest rank over each of the connected components? I have never seen rank used this way before, so I'm really not sure.",,"['algebraic-geometry', 'schemes', 'coherent-sheaves']"

Then we specialise to the case $\lambda = -1$ and you are then asked to show that $\sigma$ has order 4. Then we're told that holomorphic maps from $\mathbb{C} / \Lambda $ to $\mathbb{C} / \Lambda $ are of the form $ z \mapsto az + b$ for some $a,b \in \mathbb{C}$ and $a \cdot \Lambda \subseteq \Lambda$, and also that for every $\lambda \neq 0,1$ we have that, for some lattice $\Lambda$, $C^{\lambda} \cong \mathbb{C} / \Lambda$. Then we're asked to calculate the lattice $\Lambda_{-1}$ such that $C^{-1} \cong \mathbb{C} / \Lambda_{-1}$.

Then it is easy to show when $\lambda = -1$ that $M(\lambda)^{k}$ is not a scalar multiple of the identity, unless $k$ is a multiple of 4. Hence $\sigma$ has order 4. Then suppose $\psi : \mathbb{C} / {\Lambda}_{-1} \rightarrow C^{-1}$ is an isomorphism.

Then $\sigma'$ has order 4, and since $\sigma'^{4}(z) = a^4z + b(a^3 + a^2 + a + 1)$, we see that the map $z \mapsto a^4z + b(a^3 + a^2 + a + 1)$ must be the identity on $ \mathbb{C} / {\Lambda}_{-1}$.

I include part (a) for context and part (d) because that's the part I'm stuck on. All fields in this section are algebraically closed. Let $E/K$ be an elliptic curve with Weierstrass coordinate functions $x$ and $y$. (a) Show that the map    $$ \phi: E \to \mathbb{P}^{3}  $$   defined by   $$ \phi = [1 : x : y : x^{2}] $$   maps $E$ isomorphically onto the image of two quadrics in $\mathbb{P}^{3}$. (d) Let $P \in E$. Prove that $[4]P = \mathcal{O}$ if and only if there exists a hyperplane $H \subset \mathbb{P}^{3}$ such that $\phi(E) \cap H = \{ P \}$. If char($K$) $\neq 2$, prove that there are exactly $16$ such hyperplanes, and hence that $\#E[4] = 16$. I assume char$K$ $\neq 2, 3$ for notational convenience. Thus $E/K$ is isomorphic to a plane curve given by equation  $$ y^{2} = x^{3} + ax + b $$ where $4a^{3} - 27b^{2} \neq 0$. The quadrics described in part (a) should then be given by $$ Q_{1}: z_{1} = z_{3}z_{0} $$ $$ Q_{2}: z_{2}^{2} = z_{3}z_{1} + az_{1}z_{0} + bz_{0}^{2} $$ where the $z_{i}$ are homogeneous coordinates on $\mathbb{P}^{3}$. The first part of (d) follows immediately from part (c). I'm having trouble with the hyperplanes, here is my latest attempt: We first note that there are $4$ immediate $4$-torsion points of $E$ given by $\mathcal{O}$ and the $3$ points of order $2$ corresponding to the roots of the equation $x^{3} + ax + b$. This gives us $4$ hyperplanes with the required intersection property. It can be checked that $[0 : 0 : 0 : 1] = \phi(\mathcal{O})$  and that this is the only point on both quadrics where $z_{0} = 0$, so we can assume $z_{0} \neq 0$. We can also assume $z_{2} \neq 0$ since these points are the images of the points of order $2$. Now consider a general hyperplane: $$ H: c_{0}z_{0} + c_{1}z_{1} + c_{2}z_{2} + c_{3}z_{3}. $$ If $c_{3} = 0$ then $H$ passes through $\phi(\mathcal{O})$ and so if it intersects $\phi(E)$ once could only be one of the hyperplanes we have already counted, so we can assume $c_{3} \neq 0$ and since the hyperlanes are parameterised by $\mathbb{P}^{3}$, we can assume $c_{3} = 1$ . Thus setting $u = \frac{z_{1}}{z_{0}}$, $v = \frac{z_{2}}{z_{0}}$, $w = \frac{z_{3}}{z_{0}}$, we reduce to $$ Q_{1}: u^{2} = w $$ $$ Q_{2}: v^{2} = wu + au + b $$ $$ H: c_{0} + c_{1}u + c_{2}v + w = 0. $$ The first equation clearly makes $w$ redundant so we can reduce to two equations: $$ Q: v^{2} = u^{3} + au + b $$ $$ H: c_{0} + c_{1}u + c_{2}v + u^{2} = 0 $$ so finally I've reduced to the intersection of an elliptic curve and a quadratic. When we do the necessary substitutions we get a quartic in $u$, which we would need to have a repeated root. I've attempted various ways using the coefficients to obtain equations in the $c_{i}$  ( formally differentiating multiple times to obtain the root and then comparing coefficients with binomial expansion etc) but each has left me with a confusing mess, so I can't help thinking I've gone wrong somewhere above. Also I never used the $z_{2} \neq 2$ condition. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

The quadrics described in part (a) should then be given by $$ Q_{1}: z_{1} = z_{3}z_{0} $$ $$ Q_{2}: z_{2}^{2} = z_{3}z_{1} + az_{1}z_{0} + bz_{0}^{2} $$ where the $z_{i}$ are homogeneous coordinates on $\mathbb{P}^{3}$. The first part of (d) follows immediately from part (c). I'm having trouble with the hyperplanes, here is my latest attempt: We first note that there are $4$ immediate $4$-torsion points of $E$ given by $\mathcal{O}$ and the $3$ points of order $2$ corresponding to the roots of the equation $x^{3} + ax + b$. This gives us $4$ hyperplanes with the required intersection property. It can be checked that $[0 : 0 : 0 : 1] = \phi(\mathcal{O})$  and that this is the only point on both quadrics where $z_{0} = 0$, so we can assume $z_{0} \neq 0$. We can also assume $z_{2} \neq 0$ since these points are the images of the points of order $2$. Now consider a general hyperplane: $$ H: c_{0}z_{0} + c_{1}z_{1} + c_{2}z_{2} + c_{3}z_{3}. $$ If $c_{3} = 0$ then $H$ passes through $\phi(\mathcal{O})$ and so if it intersects $\phi(E)$ once could only be one of the hyperplanes we have already counted, so we can assume $c_{3} \neq 0$ and since the hyperlanes are parameterised by $\mathbb{P}^{3}$, we can assume $c_{3} = 1$ . Thus setting $u = \frac{z_{1}}{z_{0}}$, $v = \frac{z_{2}}{z_{0}}$, $w = \frac{z_{3}}{z_{0}}$, we reduce to $$ Q_{1}: u^{2} = w $$ $$ Q_{2}: v^{2} = wu + au + b $$ $$ H: c_{0} + c_{1}u + c_{2}v + w = 0. $$ The first equation clearly makes $w$ redundant so we can reduce to two equations: $$ Q: v^{2} = u^{3} + au + b $$ $$ H: c_{0} + c_{1}u + c_{2}v + u^{2} = 0 $$ so finally I've reduced to the intersection of an elliptic curve and a quadratic. When we do the necessary substitutions we get a quartic in $u$, which we would need to have a repeated root. I've attempted various ways using the coefficients to obtain equations in the $c_{i}$  ( formally differentiating multiple times to obtain the root and then comparing coefficients with binomial expansion etc) but each has left me with a confusing mess, so I can't help thinking I've gone wrong somewhere above. Also I never used the $z_{2} \neq 2$ condition. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

We have a system of 10 polynomial equations on $x, y, z$ of degrees 3  $$F_1(x, y,z)=F_2(x,y,z)=...=F_{10}(x,y,z)=0$$ The hidden variable method mentioned in the paper suggests next representation: $$F_i = f_{i1}(z)x^3 + f_{i2}(z)y^3 + f_{i3}(z)x^2y + f_{i4}(z)xy^2 + ... +  f_{i8}(z)x + f_{i9}(z)y + f_{i10}(z)1$$ where $f_{ij}$ is a polynomial of z of correspondent degree from 0 ($f_{i1}$ for example) to 3 ($f_{i10}$). Now we can look write our system of equations as  $$A(z)X=0$$ where $A(z)={f_{ij}(z)}$, $X=\begin{bmatrix}x^3 & y^3 & x^2y & xy^2 & x^2 & y^2 & xy & x & y & 1\end{bmatrix}^T$ From linear algebra we know that this system can have a nontrivial solution only if $det(A(z))=0$ So writing down $det(A(z))$ as a function of will give us a single-variable polynomial on $z$. Its $k$ roots ${z_k}$ will give us possible values of $z$ that a solution of the system can have. The part above is clear for me, but next steps are not. It is said that eigenvectors of $A(z_k)$  are solutions for the system! So we have to find an eigenvector, take its 8th and 9th components (which correspond to $x$ and $y$ in $X$ vector) and we'll get a valid solution for the whole system.

75,Major confusion about sheaves of rings and sheaves of modules on schemes,Major confusion about sheaves of rings and sheaves of modules on schemes,,"So this question has largely grown out of two previous questions I asked: Question about notation/conventions for localizations of R-algebras Help understanding closed subschemes and closed immersions I have identified and consolidated some of my major points of confusion. Take exercise (2.18a) from Hartshorne as an example. There I am asked to show that if I have a morphism of rings $\phi: A \longrightarrow B$ with corresponding morphism of schemes $f: \text{Spec} B \longrightarrow \text{Spec}A$, then the corresponding morphism of sheaves $f^{\#}: \mathcal{O}_{Y} \longrightarrow f_{*}\mathcal{O}_{X}$ is injective if and only if $\phi$ is injective. Let me first lay out what I understand before getting to what is confusing me. After doing section 2.1 of Hartshorne, I felt comfortable with sheaves taking values in an abelian category. Once I got to section 2.2, however, I got a little lost. The issue that everything is done in terms of sheaves of $\textit{rings}$, which certainly do not form an abelian category (indeed we don't even have kernels!). When we take stalks of these sheaves, we find that at some point $p$ (say a prime ideal of $B$), the stalk of the sheaf $\mathcal{O}_{X}$ at $p$ is the local $\textit{ring}$ $A_{p}$. This was all well and good until I came to trying to apply exactness results for localization. Returning to the exercise I mentioned above, I went about showing that the sheaf is injective on sections. I started with $\phi: A \longrightarrow B$ and localized at a basic open set $D(h)$ to consider the morphism  $$ A_{h} \longrightarrow B_{\phi(h)} $$ I then thought I could just say that since localization is exact, this preserves exactness. However, I realized that this exactness result only holds for modules. That is, if I treated $B$ as a module over $A$, then it would be perfectly fine for me to claim that the map of $\textit{modules}$ $$ A_{h} \longrightarrow B_{h} \simeq A_{h} \otimes _{A} B $$ is injective. Speaking more generally than just the exericse, what exactly can I say about morphisms of sections, and induced morphisms of stalks since they are rings, not modules. It seems like all of section 2.1 was useless. I have also been looking at the notion of base change where I hit a similar problem. Say the morphism $\phi: A \longrightarrow B$ makes $B$ into a finite-type $A$-algebra. We would like to claim that finite-type morphisms of schemes are preserved under base change. That is, we would like to be able to say that via base change, the morphism $$ A_{h} \longrightarrow B_{\phi(h)} $$ makes $B_{\phi(h)}$ into a finite-type $A_{h}$-algebra. I can do this the hands-on way by showing how finitely many generators of $B$ over $A$ map under localization, but I wanted to try to see this more abstractly. I wanted to see the localization $B_{\phi(h)}$ as the pushout of the diagram which would be the tensor product $A_{h} \otimes_{A} B$.

I'm still not entirely sure I have asked the question exactly the right way, but I am hoping people can still clear up any confusion.","So this question has largely grown out of two previous questions I asked: Question about notation/conventions for localizations of R-algebras Help understanding closed subschemes and closed immersions I have identified and consolidated some of my major points of confusion. Take exercise (2.18a) from Hartshorne as an example. There I am asked to show that if I have a morphism of rings $\phi: A \longrightarrow B$ with corresponding morphism of schemes $f: \text{Spec} B \longrightarrow \text{Spec}A$, then the corresponding morphism of sheaves $f^{\#}: \mathcal{O}_{Y} \longrightarrow f_{*}\mathcal{O}_{X}$ is injective if and only if $\phi$ is injective. Let me first lay out what I understand before getting to what is confusing me. After doing section 2.1 of Hartshorne, I felt comfortable with sheaves taking values in an abelian category. Once I got to section 2.2, however, I got a little lost. The issue that everything is done in terms of sheaves of $\textit{rings}$, which certainly do not form an abelian category (indeed we don't even have kernels!). When we take stalks of these sheaves, we find that at some point $p$ (say a prime ideal of $B$), the stalk of the sheaf $\mathcal{O}_{X}$ at $p$ is the local $\textit{ring}$ $A_{p}$. This was all well and good until I came to trying to apply exactness results for localization. Returning to the exercise I mentioned above, I went about showing that the sheaf is injective on sections. I started with $\phi: A \longrightarrow B$ and localized at a basic open set $D(h)$ to consider the morphism  $$ A_{h} \longrightarrow B_{\phi(h)} $$ I then thought I could just say that since localization is exact, this preserves exactness. However, I realized that this exactness result only holds for modules. That is, if I treated $B$ as a module over $A$, then it would be perfectly fine for me to claim that the map of $\textit{modules}$ $$ A_{h} \longrightarrow B_{h} \simeq A_{h} \otimes _{A} B $$ is injective. Speaking more generally than just the exericse, what exactly can I say about morphisms of sections, and induced morphisms of stalks since they are rings, not modules. It seems like all of section 2.1 was useless. I have also been looking at the notion of base change where I hit a similar problem. Say the morphism $\phi: A \longrightarrow B$ makes $B$ into a finite-type $A$-algebra. We would like to claim that finite-type morphisms of schemes are preserved under base change. That is, we would like to be able to say that via base change, the morphism $$ A_{h} \longrightarrow B_{\phi(h)} $$ makes $B_{\phi(h)}$ into a finite-type $A_{h}$-algebra. I can do this the hands-on way by showing how finitely many generators of $B$ over $A$ map under localization, but I wanted to try to see this more abstractly. I wanted to see the localization $B_{\phi(h)}$ as the pushout of the diagram which would be the tensor product $A_{h} \otimes_{A} B$. Then I realized again that this would only be the case in the category of modules, which brought me back to my original confusion. Is it true that as rings, there holds $B_{\phi(h)} \simeq A_{h} \otimes_{A} B$? Or is it only true when we treat $A$ and $B$ as $\textit{modules}$ that $B_{h} \simeq A_{h} \otimes_{A} B$, in which case we could apply exactness results?

I want to prove algebraically the product of varieties is variety where variety means irreducible algebraic set. Let $A,B$ be f.g. reduced $k$ -algebras and I should assume $k$ algebraically closed. Then $A\otimes B$ is reduced. From Noether normalization, I obtain $k[x_1,\dots, x_n]\to A$ as integral extension and $k[y_1,\dots, y_m]\to B$ as integral extension. And Noether normalization does not require $k$ algebraically closed. So I obtained the following natural map. Denote $R_1=k[x_1,\dots, x_n],R_2=k[y_1,\dots, y_m]$ . $R=R_1\otimes R_2=k[x_1,\dots, x_n,y_1,\dots, y_m]\to A\otimes B$ . It suffices to show any $0\neq a\otimes b\in A\otimes B$ is integral over $R$ . Clearly $a\otimes 1$ integral over $R$ and $1\otimes b$ integral over $R$ as well. So $R\to R[a\otimes 1]\to R[a\otimes 1,1\otimes b]$ are the extensions and both extensions are finite. So I conclude that $a\otimes b$ is integral over $R$ . So if I have $0\neq x,y\in A\otimes B$ and $xy=0$ say $x$ satisfies equation $f(z)=0$ and $y$ satisfies $g(z)=0$ where $f,g\in R[z]$ are monics. Choose $f,g$ containing constant term say $f_0,g_0\in R$ . Then I check $f(x)g(y)=0$ by plugging in $x$ and $y$ values correspondingly. However $xy=0$ implies $f_0g_0=0$ . Since $R=k[x_1,\dots, x_n,y_1,\dots, y_n]$ is integral domain, I conclude that $g_0=0$ or $f_0=0$ which is contradiction. So $xy\neq 0$ for any $0\neq x,y\in R$ . I did not use that $k$ is algebraically closed. I feel I have done something wrong here. I think one the possible mistake would be $R_1\otimes R_2\to R_1\otimes B\to A\otimes B$ 's last extension as there is no reason to believe $B$ is flat over $k$ as a module first.","This is a rough idea I have to prove the statement of the following.

Both $\mathcal{O}_X$ and $\mathcal{O}_Y$ are commutative rings with a multiplicative identity, so when considering a ring homomorphism $\varphi: \mathcal{O}_Y \to \mathcal{O}_X$ we will mean a function $\mathcal{O}_Y \to \mathcal{O}_X$ such that for all $g_1,g_2 \in \mathcal{O}_Y$ $\varphi(g_1+g_2)=\varphi(g_1)+ \varphi(g_2)$, $\varphi(g_1g_2)=\varphi(g_1)\varphi(g_2)$, and $\varphi(1+J)=1+I$. Question: Under what conditions on the field $k$ is any ring homomorphism $\varphi: \mathcal{O}_Y \to \mathcal{O}_X$ a $k$-algebra homomorphism? I.e. under what conditions on the field $k$ does any ring homomorphism $\varphi: \mathcal{O}_Y \to \mathcal{O}_X$ commute with scalar multiplication, for all $c \in k, g \in k[y_1, \dots, y_m]$, $$\varphi(cg+J)=c\varphi(g+J)? $$ Because $k \subset k[x_1, \dots, x_n]$, $k\subset k[y_1, \dots, y_m]$, the above is equivalent to requiring, for all $c \in k$, that: $$\varphi(c+J) = c+I\,, $$ with the previously stated property following from the fact that $\varphi$ commutes with multiplication. Attempt: In special cases, e.g. $k = \mathbb{Q}$ or $k=\mathbb{R}$, this should be true (provided in the latter case that $\varphi$ is also continuous, which I don't see why we can assume in general). For more general $k$, I don't see at all why this should be true, even if $\varphi$ is continuous. For $k=\mathbb{Q}$, I think this follows from the facts that $\varphi(1+J)=1+I$, $\varphi(g_1g_2+J)=\varphi(g_1+J)\varphi(g_2+J)$, and that $\varphi((g_1+g_2)+J)= \varphi(g_1+J)+\varphi(g_2+J)$. Namely, $$\varphi(2+J) = \varphi((1+1)+J)=\varphi(1+J)+\varphi(1+J)=(1+I)+(1+I)=2+I\,, $$ and then by using induction we get that $\varphi(n+J)=n+I$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Then for any $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, we get that $\varphi(n+J)=n+I$ because $\varphi(J)=I$ and $I=\varphi(J)=\varphi((n+(-n))+J)=\varphi(n+J)+\varphi(-n+J) \implies \varphi(n+J)=-\varphi(-n+J)$. Then for any $q = \frac{m}{n} \in \mathbb{Q}$, we have that $$m+I=\varphi(m+J)=\varphi\left(\left(\frac{m}{n}\right)n+J\right)=\varphi\left(\frac{m}{n}+J\right)\varphi(n+J)=\varphi\left(\frac{m}{n}+J\right)(n+I)\\ \implies \varphi\left(\frac{m}{n}+J\right)=\frac{m}{n}+I\,.$$ Then, assuming that $\varphi$ is continuous , since any real $r \in \mathbb{R}$ is a limit of some sequence of rational numbers $\{q_n\}$, and continuous functions commute with limits of sequences, we get: $$ \varphi(r+J)=\varphi\left(\lim_{n \to \infty} (q_n+J)\right) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \varphi(q_n +J) = \lim_{n \to \infty} (q_n + I) = r+I\,. $$ Thus $\varphi(c+J)=c+I$ for all $c \in k$ for $k=\mathbb{R}$ (or $k=\mathbb{Q}$). (Related) For $k=\mathbb{C}$, since $-1 \in \mathbb{Z}$, we have that: $$-1+I= \varphi(-1 +J)= \varphi(i^2 +J)= \varphi(i+J)^2 \implies \varphi(i+J) = \pm i +I \,. $$ Since the Galois group of $\mathbb{R}[i]$ is non-trivial, I don't see how it could be possible to exclude the possibility that $\varphi(i+J)=-i+I$. Similar problems would arise with other algebraic field extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$ or $\mathbb{R}$ (I imagine). For fields without straightforward relationships to $\mathbb{Q}$, I imagine that this could fail to be true in even more dramatic ways, but I don't know, hence my question. Context: This question is inspired by Problem 4.18.5 of Algebraic Geometry: A Problem Solving Approach by Garrity et al., which asks one to show that each ring homomorphism $\mathcal{O}_Y \to \mathcal{O}_X$ corresponds to a morphism between the affine varieties $X \to Y$, for $k$ an arbitrary field. The only way I could get a proof to work was with the additional assumption that $\varphi(c+J)=c+I$ for all $c\in k$, which as I noted above is equivalent to $\varphi$ commuting with scalar multiplication and thus being a $k$-algebra homomorphism. This seems to be corroborated by Problem 4.8.4 of the same book, Wikipedia , Theorem 4.14 here , and other references I remember finding. Thus, I want to understand the extent of the strength of this additional assumption, and whether or not it actually follows for any fields $k$ from the fact that $\varphi: \mathcal{O}_Y \to \mathcal{O}_X$ is a ring homomorphism.","Definitions: Let $k$ be an arbitrary field, $I$ a prime ideal of $k[x_1, \dots, x_n]$, $J$ a prime ideal of $k[y_1, \dots, y_m]$, $X = \{ x \in k^n: \forall f \in I, \ f(x) = 0\  \} \subset k[x_1, \dots, x_n]$, $Y=\{y \in k^m: \forall g \in J, \ g(y)=0  \}$, $\mathcal{O}_X = k[x_1,\dots,x_n]/I$, and $\mathcal{O}_Y = k[y_1, \dots, y_m]/J$. (I.e. $X$ and $Y$ are affine varieties, and $\mathcal{O}_X$ and $\mathcal{O}_Y$ are their respective coordinate rings.) Both $\mathcal{O}_X$ and $\mathcal{O}_Y$ are commutative rings with a multiplicative identity, so when considering a ring homomorphism $\varphi: \mathcal{O}_Y \to \mathcal{O}_X$ we will mean a function $\mathcal{O}_Y \to \mathcal{O}_X$ such that for all $g_1,g_2 \in \mathcal{O}_Y$ $\varphi(g_1+g_2)=\varphi(g_1)+ \varphi(g_2)$, $\varphi(g_1g_2)=\varphi(g_1)\varphi(g_2)$, and $\varphi(1+J)=1+I$. Question: Under what conditions on the field $k$ is any ring homomorphism $\varphi: \mathcal{O}_Y \to \mathcal{O}_X$ a $k$-algebra homomorphism? I.e. under what conditions on the field $k$ does any ring homomorphism $\varphi: \mathcal{O}_Y \to \mathcal{O}_X$ commute with scalar multiplication, for all $c \in k, g \in k[y_1, \dots, y_m]$, $$\varphi(cg+J)=c\varphi(g+J)? $$ Because $k \subset k[x_1, \dots, x_n]$, $k\subset k[y_1, \dots, y_m]$, the above is equivalent to requiring, for all $c \in k$, that: $$\varphi(c+J) = c+I\,, $$ with the previously stated property following from the fact that $\varphi$ commutes with multiplication. Attempt: In special cases, e.g. $k = \mathbb{Q}$ or $k=\mathbb{R}$, this should be true (provided in the latter case that $\varphi$ is also continuous, which I don't see why we can assume in general). For more general $k$, I don't see at all why this should be true, even if $\varphi$ is continuous. For $k=\mathbb{Q}$, I think this follows from the facts that $\varphi(1+J)=1+I$, $\varphi(g_1g_2+J)=\varphi(g_1+J)\varphi(g_2+J)$, and that $\varphi((g_1+g_2)+J)= \varphi(g_1+J)+\varphi(g_2+J)$. Namely, $$\varphi(2+J) = \varphi((1+1)+J)=\varphi(1+J)+\varphi(1+J)=(1+I)+(1+I)=2+I\,, $$ and then by using induction we get that $\varphi(n+J)=n+I$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Then for any $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, we get that $\varphi(n+J)=n+I$ because $\varphi(J)=I$ and $I=\varphi(J)=\varphi((n+(-n))+J)=\varphi(n+J)+\varphi(-n+J) \implies \varphi(n+J)=-\varphi(-n+J)$. Then for any $q = \frac{m}{n} \in \mathbb{Q}$, we have that $$m+I=\varphi(m+J)=\varphi\left(\left(\frac{m}{n}\right)n+J\right)=\varphi\left(\frac{m}{n}+J\right)\varphi(n+J)=\varphi\left(\frac{m}{n}+J\right)(n+I)\\ \implies \varphi\left(\frac{m}{n}+J\right)=\frac{m}{n}+I\,.$$ Then, assuming that $\varphi$ is continuous , since any real $r \in \mathbb{R}$ is a limit of some sequence of rational numbers $\{q_n\}$, and continuous functions commute with limits of sequences, we get: $$ \varphi(r+J)=\varphi\left(\lim_{n \to \infty} (q_n+J)\right) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \varphi(q_n +J) = \lim_{n \to \infty} (q_n + I) = r+I\,. $$ Thus $\varphi(c+J)=c+I$ for all $c \in k$ for $k=\mathbb{R}$ (or $k=\mathbb{Q}$). (Related) For $k=\mathbb{C}$, since $-1 \in \mathbb{Z}$, we have that: $$-1+I= \varphi(-1 +J)= \varphi(i^2 +J)= \varphi(i+J)^2 \implies \varphi(i+J) = \pm i +I \,. $$ Since the Galois group of $\mathbb{R}[i]$ is non-trivial, I don't see how it could be possible to exclude the possibility that $\varphi(i+J)=-i+I$. Similar problems would arise with other algebraic field extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$ or $\mathbb{R}$ (I imagine). For fields without straightforward relationships to $\mathbb{Q}$, I imagine that this could fail to be true in even more dramatic ways, but I don't know, hence my question. Context: This question is inspired by Problem 4.18.5 of Algebraic Geometry: A Problem Solving Approach by Garrity et al., which asks one to show that each ring homomorphism $\mathcal{O}_Y \to \mathcal{O}_X$ corresponds to a morphism between the affine varieties $X \to Y$, for $k$ an arbitrary field. The only way I could get a proof to work was with the additional assumption that $\varphi(c+J)=c+I$ for all $c\in k$, which as I noted above is equivalent to $\varphi$ commuting with scalar multiplication and thus being a $k$-algebra homomorphism. This seems to be corroborated by Problem 4.8.4 of the same book, Wikipedia , Theorem 4.14 here , and other references I remember finding. Thus, I want to understand the extent of the strength of this additional assumption, and whether or not it actually follows for any fields $k$ from the fact that $\varphi: \mathcal{O}_Y \to \mathcal{O}_X$ is a ring homomorphism.",,"['abstract-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra', 'galois-theory']"

Following the theory of system of linear equations, is it sufficient that the Jacobian matrix of the system is non-singular everywhere? The idea is from implicit function theorem. If there are $m+n$ nonlinear equations with $n$ endogenous variables and $m$ exogenous variables, and the Jacobian matrix is nonsingular at a point, then we can express the $n$ endogenous variables as functions of the $m$ exogenous variables near that point.
