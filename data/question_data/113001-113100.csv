We know that $Z(P)\neq 1$ since $P$ is a $p$-group, and since $P$ is nonabelian we know that $Z(P)\neq P$.

87,Finding the kernel of an action on conjugate subgroups,Finding the kernel of an action on conjugate subgroups,,"I'm trying to solve the following problem: Let $G$ be a group of order 12. Assume the 3-Sylow subgroups of $G$ are not normal.  Prove that $G\cong A_4$. Here's my attempt: let $\mathscr S$ be the set of 3-Sylow subgroups of $G$. Since the elements of $\mathscr S$ are not normal, by Sylow's theorem, $\# \mathscr S > 1$. Again by Sylow's theorem, $\#\mathscr S = 4$ and the elements of $\mathscr S$ are conjugate to each other.  Hence, one can define a group action of $G$ on $\mathscr S$ by conjugation, and this defines a homomorphism $\phi : G\rightarrow \mathrm{Sym}(\mathscr S)\cong S_4$.  Thus, it suffices to show that $\phi$ is injective and its image is $A_4$. But I'm stuck at this last step.  I tried to find the kernel of $\phi$ and found that $a\in\mathrm{Ker}\phi\Leftrightarrow \forall H\in\mathscr S\ aHa^{-1} = H$, but I do not understand what this leads to.
