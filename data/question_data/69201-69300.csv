8,Cardinality of the Euclidean topology and the axiom of choice,Cardinality of the Euclidean topology and the axiom of choice,,"It is relatively straightforward to prove that the Euclidean topology has the same cardinality as the space itself. I have sketched a proof below. The proof seems to rely quite heavily on the axiom of choice. I'm perfectly fine with (countable) dependent choice — I want to be able to define sequences recursively, for example — but one doesn't usually need more choice for topology in Euclidean spaces. Is dependent choice enough to show that the topology of $\mathbb R^n$, $n\geq1$, has the same cardinality as $\mathbb R^n$? If yes, how to prove it? If not, how much do we know about the cardinality of the topology? It seems that the cardinality of the topology lies between $\mathfrak{c}$ and $2^{\mathfrak{c}}$, but are there tighter bounds? Proof of equal cardinalities with choice: Let $T$ be the topology of $\mathbb R^n$ and $B$ a countable basis for it (rational balls, for example). Since $|2^B|=|\mathbb R^n|$, it suffices to find an injection $f:\mathbb R^n\to T$ and a surjection $g:2^B\to T$. These together will establish $|\mathbb R^n|\leq|T|\leq|2^B|=|\mathbb R^n|$ and the conclusion follows. (Alternatively, the surjection $g$ has an injective right inverse, and we thus have injections both ways between $\mathbb R^n$ and $T$. The existence of a bijection follows from the Schröder–Bernstein theorem.) We can simply take $f(x)=B(x,1)$ and $g(A)=\bigcup_{U\in A}U$. Injecting $\mathbb R^n$ to $T$ requires no choice and always $T\subset 2^{\mathbb R^n}$, so at least $\mathfrak{c}\leq|T|\leq2^{\mathfrak{c}}$ without AC. Without choice, I can't compare cardinals so easily or produce injective right inverses for surjections, so my proof falls apart.","It is relatively straightforward to prove that the Euclidean topology has the same cardinality as the space itself.

I wanted to assert the existence of an irredundant subcover of a given open cover, but realized I'm not sure how to guarantee that this exists. I got around this technicality in that particular situation by using other aspects of the setup, but now I want to understand the general situation. I'll phrase the question in the language of topology, but it is really purely a set-theoretic question. Let us call an open cover $\{U_\lambda\}_{\lambda\in\Lambda}$ irredundant if no $U_\lambda$ can be dropped, i.e. if $\{U_\lambda\}_{\lambda\in\Lambda'}$ is never a cover if $\Lambda'$ is a proper subset of $\Lambda$; equivalently, if for each $\lambda\in\Lambda$, $\bigcap_{\mu\neq \lambda} (U_\mu)^c$ is nonempty. Given a topological space $X$ with an arbitrary open cover $\{U_\lambda\}_{\lambda\in\Lambda}$, does there always exist an irredundant subcover? Why? Clearly there is no problem if $\Lambda$ is finite (or if $X$ is compact so that we can first pass to a finite subcover): just drop redundant $U_\lambda$'s one at a time until the cover is irredundant. But what if $\Lambda$ has much bigger cardinality? At first I thought we ought to be able to construct an irredundant subcover using some appropriate form of the axiom of choice. After all, I thought, all we have to do is drop the redundant $U_\lambda$'s. (I.e. those such that $\bigcap_{\mu\neq \lambda}(U_\mu)^c$ is empty.) We can't drop them all at once, unfortunately, since we might not be left with a cover. But if we drop them one at a time, and reevaluate which are redundant after each drop, then, well, AC is designed for organizing an infinite sequence of choices of this kind. For example we could try: by the well-ordering theorem, impose a well-order on $\Lambda$. Then the set of $\lambda$'s corresponding to redundant $U_\lambda$'s has a least element, and this is what we drop first. Rinse and repeat. Or (this was my first idea), the setup seems custom made for Zorn's lemma: the subcovers of a given cover form a nonempty poset under reverse inclusion, and the irredundant covers are precisely the maximal elements of this poset. The problem is that in the end, I don't actually think one can generally arrive at an irredundant cover, even when it exists, by dropping redundant $U_\lambda$'s one at a time. The example I have in mind is, let $X$ be any nonempty space at all, let $\Lambda = \mathbb{N}$, and let $U_1,U_2,\dots = X$. This example shows that both of the above approaches will fail. If we try to construct an irredundant subcover by repeatedly dropping the first redundant $U_n$, we get the sequence of subcovers $$ \{U_n\}_{n\geq 1}\supset \{U_n\}_{n\geq 2}\supset \dots$$ and the procedure never lands on an irredundant one since the limit is empty, which isn't a cover. This very sequence also shows the hypotheses of Zorn's lemma aren't met (in the attempt above to use Zorn's lemma): here is an increasing chain in the poset of subcovers that does not have an upper bound. This example seems to me to show that the AC-based approaches are barking up the wrong tree. On the other hand, evidently there is an irredundant cover here: any individual $U_n$ will do the job.

Now by compactness of $X$, we know the inverse image $f^{-1}((w_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}})$ of the sequence contains a limit point, denote it by $z$, which lies in $V$ (as $V$ is closed). But then, by continuity of $f$, we also know that $f(z)$ must be a limit point of the sequence $(w_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$. By the fact that the latter converges, we deduce that this limit point must be the unique limit. Thus we have \begin{equation}  V \ni z \mapsto f(z) \notin f(V) \end{equation} which is a contradiction. Here is my question: Where does the Hausdorff condition for $Y$ enter the proof ? Since it is not mentioned in my above attempt I must have a mistake somehwhere .. what did I miss ? Many thanks for your help !!",,['general-topology']
