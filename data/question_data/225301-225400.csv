2,Going Up Theorem - Examples? Witnesses?,Going Up Theorem - Examples? Witnesses?,,"I am currently in Chapter 5 - Integral Dependence and Valuations of the text Introduction to Commutative Algebra by Atiyah - Macdonald. I am in particular studying the `Going-up theorem', and I have a request/question that the community here may be able to help with. First I should mention that I know there are many other questions on MSE regarding the Going-up theorem, and none of them address my question. I have also spent several hours scouring google, and still have nothing. I currently feel confident that I understand both the statement and proof of the Going-up theorem, but I feel I am missing the importance. It has been noted in this question that the algebro-geometric interpretation is a more compelling account of the result. What I believe would solidify my understanding is to see concrete examples and applications of the Going-up theorem. I am also familiar with the results in the exercises from Chapter 5 that give the geometric equivalent of the theorem, i.e. the conditions of the map $f^*:\mathrm{Spec}(B) \to \mathrm{Spec}(A)$ when the map $A \to B$ is an integral morphism, or satisfies the Going-up property, so geometric examples that transpire from the algebraic theorem would also be nice. Working out of Atiyah-Macdonald is currently my only exposure to commutative algebra, I am familiar with nearly all of the content in the previous chapters and have done the majority of the exercises from the previous chapters. However, as most know the book is very terse and general, in my opinion, in the sense that there are not many explicit examples included, which is fine, but filling in the blanks with explicit examples has been one of my main difficulties while working out of the text. In case it is relevant, I also have exposure to elementary algebraic geometry - so feel free to provide an example relating to varieties, coordinate rings, etc. To be explicit, my question is: Can someone provide explicit examples of any of the following: Explicit (preferably interesting) rings $A$ and $B$ such that $B$ is integral over $A$. An explicit chain of prime ideals $\mathfrak{p_1} \subseteq \dots \subseteq \mathfrak{p_n}$ of $A$ and a chain $\mathfrak{q_1} \subseteq > \dots \subseteq \mathfrak{q_m}$ ($m < n$) such that $\mathfrak{q_i} > \cap A = \mathfrak{p}_1$ and explicitly find the extended chain    $\mathfrak{q}_1 \subseteq \dots \subseteq \mathfrak{q}_m$ $\mathfrak{q}_1 \subseteq \dots \subseteq \mathfrak{q}_n$ Show explicitly what geometric information can be learned from $f \colon A \to B$ being an integral homomorphism implying that   $\mathrm{Spec}(B) \to \mathrm{Spec}(A)$ being a closed map. One of my thoughts was that coordinate rings of varieties might lead to good examples? Last, I must mention that I know this is not a typical MSE question, but after reviewing the criteria of acceptable questions for MSE, I think it satisfies since it is mathematical and it is answerable , that is, there are objectively correct answers containing the explicit examples I seek.

The direction $f^\sharp:\mathcal O_Y\rightarrow f_\ast\mathcal O_X$ of a morphism $(X,\mathcal O_X)\rightarrow (Y,\mathcal O_Y)$ is clear to me, but I am struggling to understand the geometric significance of respecting the maximal ideals. I don't know commutative algebra so excuse the question if it's a well discussed triviality. First, let's switch from $f^\sharp:\mathcal O_Y\rightarrow f_\ast\mathcal O_X$ to $f^\flat:f^\ast\mathcal O_Y\rightarrow \mathcal O_X$. Now we can look at a map between the stalks at $x\in X$: $$\mathcal O_{Y,f(x)}\rightarrow \mathcal O_{X,x}$$ The maximal ideal $\mathfrak m_{f(x)}\vartriangleleft \mathcal O_{Y,f(x)}$ is comprised of the nonzero germs at $f(x)$. These are just the locally non-invertible functions at $f(x)$. To map $\mathfrak m_{f(x)}$ into $\mathfrak m_x$ is to say we do not accidentally invert any nonunits in $\mathcal O_{Y,f(x)}$. This sounds like a good thing at the formal level, but what are some interesting geometric examples in which not being a local homomorphism has unpleasant consequences?",,"['algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra']"

Any help would be greatly appreciated.","Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field, and $A, B$ affine $k$-algebras.  We can define a functor $\mathfrak F$ from the category of affine $k$-algebras to that of affine algebraic varieties, by making $Max(A)$ into a topological space (for $g \in A$, set $D(g)$ to be the set of $\mathfrak m \in Max(A)$ for which $g \not\in \mathfrak m$; this is a basis for a topology of which every open set is a finite union).  We then define a sheaf $\mathcal O_A$ on $Max(A)$ in a natural way, and obtain the affine $k$-algebra $(Max(A), \mathcal O_A) = \mathfrak F(A)$. I know how to prove that the functor $\mathfrak F$ induces an antiequivalence of categories.  I know that the tensor product $A \otimes_k B$ is a coproduct in the category of affine $k$-algebras, so it follows that $\mathfrak F(A \otimes_k B)$ is a product in the category of affine varieties.  But I have also read that the cartesian product $Max(A) \times Max(B)$, along with the natural projections onto $Max(A), Max(B)$, can serve as the underlying set (usually not in the product topology) of the product of affine varieties $\mathfrak F(A)$ and $\mathfrak F(B)$.

In particular, the fibers of the maps will be the connected components of $X$. (Milne's definition of a variety is a finite type $k$ scheme that is also geometrically reduced and separable.) In particular, he claims that 1) $\pi_0(X)$ exists 2) the map $X\rightarrow \pi_0(X)$ commutes with extension of the base field 3) $\pi_0(X\times_k Y) = \pi_0(X)\times_k\pi_0(Y)$. This is used to show that a connected algebraic group is irreducible by allowing us to reduce to the case $k=\overline{k}$ by base change (after which our group would still be connected). However, these facts are not obvious to me, and I wondered if there was a reference or an explanation.

If I assume that he meant for $\pi_0(X)$ to just be a scheme and not geometrically reduced, then I have to think of what the right nonreduced structure is, and I'm not sure how to do that.

This isn't homework.","If $X$ is a prevariety and the open sets $X_f:=\{x:f(x)\neq 0\}$ form a basis for the topology of $X$ as $f$ varies over $\Gamma(X,\mathcal{O}_X)$, then why is $X$ quasi-affine? The definitions are from Mumford's red book, so prevariety is a scheme with a finite covering by affine varieties (all over the same algebraically closed field), and a quasi-affine variety is an open subset of an affine variety. I found this problem as problem 6 of http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-725-algebraic-geometry-fall-2003/assignments/ps6.pdf , and it wasn't clear to me how to even start (where would I get the ambient affine variety?).
