My intuition says I can calculate the probability of the marble being placed in to any bucket except A as $\frac{3}{4}$. Then I can multiply the probabilities together since they are independent. So I can do $\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^ 4$, which seems right.

In any group of $k$ people, there exists at least one person who shakes hands with all other persons in that group. What is the minimum number of handshakes that can take place at the party? The problem is inspired from a contest question which I want to solve in general. Here are my attempts in solving the problem: There are $\binom n k$ possible groups. In each group, the minimum number of handshakes is $k-1$ . So, at first I thought the answer should be $(k-1)\binom n k$ . But I realized that the maximum number of handshakes is $\binom n 2$ .

Question 3: https://bmos.ukmt.org.uk/home/bmo2-2011.pdf To paraphrase the question, it asks for the number of positive integers $n < 2011$ such that $f(n) = f(2011) = 21$ , where $f$ is defined on the positive integers as: $f(1) = 1$ $f(4n) = f(2n)$ $f(4n+1) = 2f(2n) + 1$ $f(4n+2) = 2f(2n+1)$ $f(4n+3) = f(2n+1)$ My method was to note that the only ""path"" to $21$ is $1,2,5,10,21$ . The only positive ints that are mapped to $1$ are of the form $2^a - 1$ , and so the only ints mapped to $2$ are of the form $2^b(2^a-1)$ , and continuing in this fashion and expanding out, we have the only integers that map to $21$ are those of the form $2^{a+b+c+d+e}-2^{a+b+c+d}+2^{a+b+c}-2^{a+b}+2^e$ , where $a,b,c,d,e \geq 1$ . So the number of solutions is equal to the number of sequences $y_1 > y_2 > y_3 > y_4 > y_5 \geq 1$ such that $$ 2^{y_1} - 2^{y_2} + 2^{y_3} - 2^{y_4} + 2^{y_5} - 1 < 2011$$ . This in turn is equal to the number of sequences $x_1 > x_2 > x_3 > x_4 > x_5 \geq 0$ such that $$ 2^{x_1} - 2^{x_2} + 2^{x_3} - 2^{x_4} + 2^{x_5} \leq 1005 $$ . Then I defined the function $F_k(n)$ as equal to the number of solutions to the more general problem, where the sum of powers must be $\leq n$ and there are $k$ variables instead of $5$ , so the answer is $f_5(1005)$ . Because of the self similarity of the constraint, we have the following recurrence relation: $$ F_k(n) = \sum_{m\geq 0}{F_{k-1}\left\lfloor\frac{n + (-1)^k2^m}{2^{m+1}}\right\rfloor} $$ With base cases of: $$ F_1(n) = \lfloor \log_2{n} \rfloor $$ $$ F_k(n) = 0 \text{ when } n \leq 0$$ I implemented both the original problem and my solution in Python to check, and they both gave the same answer, $455$ , so my solution is correct. However the paper is intended to be done without a calculator or computer, and it computing the desired value of $F$ by hand seems to need far too many calculations (these questions rarely require drawn out calculations). So I assume that there is a more efficient method, either in calculating the values of $F$ or by looking at the problem from a completely different angle, both of which I would find extremely helpful.","I've been practicing for the second round of the BMO and I've come across a question for which I think there must be a more efficient solution than I found.

I am doing my first course in discrete mathematics, and came across the following proposition that I was asked to prove: Let $a,b,d \in \mathbb{Z}$ . If $d = \gcd(a,b)\ \text{then} \ \gcd\Bigl(\dfrac{a}{d}, \dfrac{b}{d}\Bigr) = 1$ . My first thought was to prove it by contradiction, and I did it as follows, Let $a,b,c,d \in \mathbb{Z}$ and suppose that $d = \gcd(a,b).$ Assume that $\ \gcd\Bigl(\dfrac{a}{d}, \dfrac{b}{d}\Bigr) = c$ , where $c \neq 1 $ . Then $c\mid\frac{a}{d} \ \text{and} \   c\mid\frac{b}{d}$ , that is, $a = cmd \ \text{and} \ b = cnd$ , where $m,n \in \mathbb{Z}$ This implies that there is a integer $cd$ that divides both $a$ and $b$ , where $cd > d$ . But, $d$ is the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ , which yields a contradiction. Therefore, the assumption is false, and $\ \gcd\Bigl(\dfrac{a}{d}, \dfrac{b}{d}\Bigr) = 1$ . This is my approach, but the solution presented by the TA's notes uses a different approach which, given the way it was presented, I could not understand how it would prove the proposition. The approach uses Bézout's theorem, which was presented to us in following manner: Consider the equation $$ax+by=c,$$ where $a,b,c$ are integers, with $a$ and $b$ not both zero. if $ c=d$ , where $d$ is the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ then the equation has a solution in integers $x,y$ . if $d\mid c$ then the equation has a solution in integers. if $d\nmid c$ then the equation has no solution in integers. The proof presented went on to apply this theorem to prove the proposition: Consider the equation $$ax+by=d,$$ where $d = \gcd(a,b)$ (with integer coefficients). Dividing both sides by $d$ yields, $$\frac{a}{d}x+\dfrac{b}{d}y=1,$$ where $\dfrac{a}{d}$ and $\dfrac{b}{d}$ are both integers (follows from definition of that $\gcd$ ) and then it goes on to say by Bézout's theorem, we can conclude that $\ \gcd\Bigl(\dfrac{a}{d}, \dfrac{b}{d}\Bigr) = 1$ Now, I am really confused as to what role Bézout's theorem (the way it is presented to us) has played in their conclusion; the theorem does not say that if there are integer solutions then the RHS must be the gcd of the coefficients. $\textbf{And}$ if they claimed that $\dfrac{a}{d}$ and $\dfrac{b}{d}$ are relatively prime, wouldn't that mean that, by definition, their greatest common divisor must be 1? Because if so, then I really do not see the need to use the theorem in the first place. Given that some of the proofs for this proposition (that I have seen) here and on other websites use Bézout's theorem, I am inclined to believe that there is something wrong with my way of thinking, as in there is something I am not seeing, so I would appreciate it if you could clarify this for me.

The suitable recurrence relation for this problem is: $a_{n+2} = 2a_{n-1} + 4a{n-2}$. Hence, the characteristic polynomial is: $x^2 -2x -4 = 0$.It's roots are: $1+\sqrt5,1-\sqrt5$. So, the genral function is: $\alpha (1+\sqrt5)^n + \beta (1-\sqrt5)^n$  We know that: $a_0=1$ and $a_1=4$. Hence, $\beta = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{3}{2\sqrt5}$, $\alpha = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{3}{2\sqrt5}$ All in all, $$(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{3}{2\sqrt5})(1+\sqrt5)^n + (\frac{1}{2} - \frac{3}{2\sqrt5})(1-\sqrt5)^n$$ Now, for $n=6$ the result is $1344$, but the book says $1216$.

99,Basic probability question (coins),Basic probability question (coins),,"There is a pile of $129$ coins on a table, all unbiased except for one which has heads on both sides. Bob chooses a coin at random and tosses it eight times. The coin comes up heads every time. What is the probability that it will come up heads the ninth time as well? To start, $P(H) = (\frac{1}2)^{9}$ $($If the chosen coin is unbiased$)$ or $P(H)= 1^{9}$ $($If the chosen coin is biased$)$ I'm not sure how to combine these to answer the question.I would appreciate it if someone could give an elementary explanation to this. Thanks.","There is a pile of $129$ coins on a table, all unbiased except for one which has heads on both sides. Bob chooses a coin at random and tosses it eight times.
