13,Deformations of codimension 2 ACM subschemes,Deformations of codimension 2 ACM subschemes,,"I have a question about a theorem and example in Hartshorne's ""Deformation Theory"" p. 65. The theorem reads: Theorem 8.9 Let $Y_0$ be an ACM closed subscheme of codimension 2 of $X_0=\mathbb{P}^n_k$ , and assume $\dim Y_0\ge1$ . Using notation (6.1) [note: this means we have an exact sequence $$0\to J\to C'\to C\to0$$ where $C$ and $C'$ are local Artin rings with residue field $k$ and $J$ is an ideal with $\mathfrak{m}_{C'}J=0$ ], suppose we are given a closed subscheme $Y$ of $X=\mathbb{P}^n_C$ , flat over $C$ and with $Y\times_Ck=Y_0$ . Then: (a) There is an $r\times(r+1)$ matrix $\varphi$ of homogeneous elements of $R=C[x_0,\ldots,x_n]$ whose $r\times r$ minors $f_i$ generate the ideal $I$ of $Y$ , and give a resolution $$0\to\bigoplus R(-b_i)\xrightarrow{\varphi}\bigoplus R(-a_i)\xrightarrow{f}R\to R/I\to0.$$ (b) For any lifting $\varphi'$ of $\varphi$ to $R'=C'[x_0,\ldots,x_n]$ , taking $f'$ to be the $r\times r$ minors gives an exact sequence $$0\to\bigoplus R'(-b_i)\xrightarrow{\varphi'}\bigoplus R'(-a_i)\xrightarrow{f'}R'\to R'/I'\to0$$ and defines a closed subscheme $Y'$ of $X'=\mathbb{P}^n_{C'}$ , flat over $C'$ , with $Y'\times_{C'}C=Y$ . (c) Any lifting $Y'$ of $Y$ to $X'$ , flat over $C'$ with $Y'\times_{C'}C=Y$ , arises by lifting $\varphi$ as in (b). This theorem is followed by: Example 8.9.1 The conclusions of (8.9) are false in the case of a scheme $Y_0$ of dimension 0 in $\mathbb{P}^n$ . For example, let $Y_0$ be a set of three collinear points in $\mathbb{P}^2$ . Then there is a linear form in the ideal of $Y_0$ . But as you deform the points in the direction of a set of three noncollinear points of $\mathbb{P}^2$ , the linear form does not lift. So the deformations of $Y_0$ cannot all be obtained by lifting the elements of the corresponding matrix $\varphi$ . I think I understand why this is a counterexample in dimension 0. Now suppose we replace this $Y_0$ with the cone over $Y_0$ in $\mathbb{P}^3$ . Now it has dimension 1, and is still ACM of codimension 2, so (8.9) applies. Yet it seems like the argument in (8.9.1) still works. Instead of three collinear points, we have three coplanar coincident lines, so there is a linear form in the ideal of the lines. Yet if we deform in the direction of three noncoplanar lines, still coincident at the cone point (just take the cone over the deformation from (8.9.1)), the linear form does not lift.

This is going to be long, so grab your favorite beverage and snack. I am working through Görtz and Wedhorn's ""Algebraic Geometry I""  and I am currently at chapter 6, more specifically the tangent space definition. So they are giving the ""usual"" definition of the tangent space of a scheme $X$ at a point $x$ by $$ T_xX:=(\mathfrak{m}_x/\mathfrak{m}_x^2)^*. $$ Now let $f:X\to Y$ be a morphism of schemes, than we have a map $f_x^\sharp:\mathcal{O}_{Y,f(x)}\to \mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ which induces a $k(x)$-linear map from $\mathfrak{m}_{f(x)}/\mathfrak{m}_{f(x)}^2\otimes_{k(f(x))}k(x) \to \mathfrak{m}_x/\mathfrak{m}_x^2$. Dualizing this map gives us a map on tangent spaces which we denote: $$ df:T_xX \to T_{f(x)}Y\otimes_{k(f(x))}k(x). $$ For those of you who have the book in front of you: I'm now particularly interested in Example 6.4 and there especially the second part which is as following: Let $\mathbb{A}^n_k$ be the affine space over a field $k$. Here the authors don't make any restriction on the field. This is going to be important to my question. Now let $f:\mathbb{A}^n\to \mathbb{A}^r$ be a map given by polynomials $f_1,\ldots,f_r \in k[T_1,\ldots,T_n]$ and let $x\in \mathbb{A}^n_k(k)$ be a rational point. Then the map $df_x$ is given by the Jacobian: $$ \left( \dfrac{\partial f_i}{\partial T_j} \right)_{i,j}. $$ Here is my attempt to confirm this: first of all I think the authors secretly assume that $k$ is algebraicly closed because they assume that $x=(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ and the associated maximal ideal is $(T_1-x_1,\ldots,T_n-x_n)$. Now let's assume this and look how the maps work. The induced map on the coordinate rings is \begin{eqnarray} f^\sharp:k[Y_1,\ldots,Y_r] &\to & k[T_1,\ldots,T_n]\\ g &\mapsto & g(f_1,\ldots,f_r), \end{eqnarray} (I hope the notation is clear). Now going to the stalks is just localizing at the respective maximal ideals which are $(T_1-x_1,\ldots,T_n-x_n)=:\mathfrak{m}_x$ and $(Y_1-b_1,\ldots,Y_r-b_r)=:\mathfrak{m}_{f(x)}$ where $b=f(x)$. I will abuse notation a little bit here, so $\mathfrak{m}_x,\mathfrak{m}_{f(x)}$ will also denote the maximal ideals in the stalk. I think this is justified since they really are the maximal ideals under the injection given by localization. Now the induced map on the stalk level doesn't look different from the map on the coordinate rings and since we are particularly interested in how the maps work on the maximal ideals we check this for generators of $\mathfrak{m}_{f(x)}$. We can figure that the map there works as following: \begin{eqnarray} f^\sharp_x:\mathfrak{m}_{f(x)}&\to &\mathfrak{m}_{x}\\ Y_i-f_i(x) &\mapsto & f_i-f_i(x) \end{eqnarray} Now comes the interesting part and my actual question. To describe the actual map I will use the Taylor-polynomial of $f_i$ which is: \begin{eqnarray} T_nf_i(x,T)&=&f_i(x)+\langle (gradf_{i})_x,(T-x)\rangle+\mathfrak{m}_x^2 \\ &=&f_i(x)+\sum_{i=1}^n \dfrac{\partial f_i}{\partial T_i}(x)(T_i-x_i)+\mathfrak{m}_x^2 .  \end{eqnarray} Now comes the part that bothers me: Using that $f_i(T)=T_nf_i(x,T)$ I get that $f_i-f_i(x)=\sum_{i=1}^n \dfrac{\partial f_i}{\partial T_i}(x)(T_i-x_i)+\mathfrak{m}_x^2 $ and so by passing to the quotient $\mathfrak{m}_x/\mathfrak{m}_x^2$ I can see how the map works and figure out that the map $df$ is indeed the Jacobian matrix. So here is my question: My argument relies on the identity $$ f_i(T)=T_nf_i(x,T) $$ for some large enough $n$. I know that this is true for $k=\mathbb{C}$ (and therefore for any subfield) but why should this be true for any other field? In particular you have to be very carefully in even defining this in positiv characteristic. Does anybody know about this?

Specifically, the equations are: $$f\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i4} - K1 = 0$$ $$f\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i3}x_{i2} - K_2 = 0$$ $$f\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i1}x_{i3} - K_3 = 0$$ $$f\sum_{i=1}^n p_{z1}x_{i2}x_{i3} + f\sum_{i=1}^np_{y1}x_{i1}x_{13} - K_4 = 0$$ $$f\sum_{i=1}^n p_{z1}x_{i4} - f\sum_{i=1}^np_{x1}x_{i1}x_{13} - K_5 = 0$$ $$f\sum_{i=1}^n -p_{y1}x_{i4} - f\sum_{i=1}^np_{z1}x_{i1}x_{13} - K_6 = 0$$ along with the ""circularity equations"": $$x_{i1}^2 + x_{12}^2 = 1$$ $$x_{i3}^2 + x_{14}^2 = 1$$ where $f \in \mathbb{R}^+$, $K_j \in \mathbb{R}$ (there is technically another set of circularity equations but they are on variables that do not appear in the above system).",,"['algebraic-geometry', 'polynomials', 'systems-of-equations', 'quadratics', 'real-algebraic-geometry']"

So in this example, a quadratic differential with simple poles at the branch points lifts to a smooth quadratic differential on $C$ (with prescribed zeroes at four of the ten ramification points).

They don't do those calculations, instead only state the results and I seem to be missing something to understand how this is done in principle. To be more concrete, the easiest example they consider is (p. 31): $C$ given as $y^2 = (x^3 - 1) (x^3 - a)$ with automorphism $\phi(x,y) = (\zeta_3 x, - y)$, where $\zeta_3$ is a primitive third root of $1$. $C$ has genus $2$, so $H^0(2 K_C)$ has dimension $3$.

Define a presheaf by $U\mapsto (\mathcal{O}_X(U))_{red}$, where the reduction of ring $A$ is defined to be $A$ quotient by its nilradical, ie $A_{red} = A/\sqrt{0}$. Define $(\mathcal{O}_X)_{red}$ to be the sheaf associated to the previous presheaf. Show that $(X,(\mathcal{O}_X)_{red})$ is a scheme (there is more to the exercise, but my question does not concern it). I managed to do this exercise in this exercise by reducing to the affine case and showing that $(\text{Spec }A,(\mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec }A})_{red})\cong (\text{Spec }A/\sqrt{0}, \mathcal{0}_{\text{Spec }A/\sqrt{0}})$ by actually defining an isomorphism on basic open sets. To me, this is the most straight forward way to do this exercise. However, there are quite a few things to check. I asked my lecturer about it and he suggested that instead of defining the isomorphisms on basic open sets, I could define the map by looking at the following diagram of sheaves on $\text{Spec }A$: $$ \begin{array}{ccc} 0 &  &   \\ \downarrow & & \\ \sqrt{0} &  & \\ \downarrow & \searrow & \\ \mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec }A} &\rightarrow & \mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec }A/\sqrt{0}} \\ \downarrow & \nearrow & \\ (\mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec }A})_{red} & & \\ \downarrow & & \\ 0 & & \\ \end{array} $$ (sorry about the terrible diagram, I don't know of a better way to draw them on math.SE) Here the map $\mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec }A} \rightarrow \mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec } A/\sqrt{0}}$ is the map coming from the ring map $A\rightarrow A/\sqrt{0}$. And $\sqrt{0}$ is the sheaf of ideals $U\mapsto \text{nilrad}({\mathcal{O}_X(U)})$. Now, my lecturer said that to show that the $\begin{array}{c}\nearrow \\ \end{array}$ map exists it is enough to show that the $\begin{array}{c}\searrow \\ \end{array}$ map is $0$ (then to show it is an isomorphism we can just look at the maps on stalks). My question is: why does the $\begin{array}{c}\searrow \\ \end{array}$ map being 0 imply that the $\begin{array}{c}\nearrow \\ \end{array}$ arrow exists. It looks identical to the case of the universal property of the quotient of abelian groups, rings (etc). Does anyone know where this is written down?

69,Algebraic Link/Knot not of the Torus Type,Algebraic Link/Knot not of the Torus Type,,"I'm studying Milnor's Singularities of Complex Hypersurfaces , and a small, perhaps moot, point in Chapter 10 has me thinking in circles. (I asked a related but different question here ). Here is some relevant background material, most of which can be found in the book. Let $f \colon (\mathbb{C}^{n},\mathbf{0}) \to (\mathbb{C},0)$ be a complex analytic function with an isolated critical point at the origin. Define the singular hypersurface $V_{f, \kappa} = f^{-1}(\kappa)$ for small $\kappa > 0$ . Milnor proves that the map $\varphi_{f} = f/\| f \| \colon S_{\epsilon}^{2n-1} \setminus V_{f, \kappa} \to S^{1}$ is a fibration, where $\epsilon > 0$ is sufficiently small. The intersection of $V_{\kappa}$ with a small sphere $S_{\epsilon}^{2n-1}$ is an algebraic link which we denote by $K_{f}$ . (It is known that all algebraic links are fibered links (by definition) as well as iterated torus links .) In 1928, Brauner proved that for $f = z_{1}^{p} + z_{2}^{q}$ , $K_{f}$ is a torus link $T_{p,q}$ , which is a knot if $p$ and $q$ are coprime. In 1968, Milnor conjectured that the unknotting number $u(T_{p,q})$ is equal to the delta invariant of the corresponding complex algebraic plane curve. By a theorem of Kronheimer and Mrowka in 1992, the conjecture is true. In the same book, Milnor proves the relation $\mu = 2 \delta - r + 1$ , where $\delta$ is the delta invariant, $r$ is the number analytically irreducible branches of $V_{f,0}$ passing through the origin and $\mu = \dim_{\mathbb{C}} \mathbb{C}\{ z_1, \dots, z_n \} / \langle \partial_1 f, \dots, \partial_n f \rangle$ . Questions: Is there an algebraic link that is not of the torus-type $T_{p,q}$ ; one whose crossing number, unknotting number, etc. is well-known? For example, what is the link of $f = z_1^{a} z_2^{b} + z_1^{c} z_{2}^{d}$ , where not both $ac = 0$ and $bd = 0$ (provided that $a,b,c,d$ are non-negative integers such that $f$ has an isolated critical point at the origin)? Can the delta invariant be defined for any non-degenerate weighted homogeneous polynomial of two variables? If so, how does one compute it? My understanding is that the delta invariant can be defined if and only if the polynomial is square-free , which leads me to yet another question: What is a square-free complex polynomial? If so, how does one reconcile the fact that the corresponding unknotting number exists but the delta invariant may not be defined, if these are suppose to be equal? Edit : The question about square-free complex polynomials has been answered in the comments. Since the ring of convergent power series $\mathbb{C}\{ z_1, \dots, z_n \}$ is a UFD, then a series $f$ is square-free if and only if factored into irreducibles, $f = f_1^{r_1} \cdots f_{n}^{r_{n}}$ , it is the case $r_{i} = 1$ . Note, here $r = \sum_i r_i$ . This is true (though not too simple to prove) if and only if $\mu$ is non-negative and finite. Thanks!","I'm studying Milnor's Singularities of Complex Hypersurfaces , and a small, perhaps moot, point in Chapter 10 has me thinking in circles. (I asked a related but different question here ). Here is some relevant background material, most of which can be found in the book. Let be a complex analytic function with an isolated critical point at the origin. Define the singular hypersurface for small . Milnor proves that the map is a fibration, where is sufficiently small. The intersection of with a small sphere is an algebraic link which we denote by . (It is known that all algebraic links are fibered links (by definition) as well as iterated torus links .) In 1928, Brauner proved that for , is a torus link , which is a knot if and are coprime. In 1968, Milnor conjectured that the unknotting number is equal to the delta invariant of the corresponding complex algebraic plane curve. By a theorem of Kronheimer and Mrowka in 1992, the conjecture is true. In the same book, Milnor proves the relation , where is the delta invariant, is the number analytically irreducible branches of passing through the origin and . Questions: Is there an algebraic link that is not of the torus-type ; one whose crossing number, unknotting number, etc. is well-known? For example, what is the link of , where not both and (provided that are non-negative integers such that has an isolated critical point at the origin)? Can the delta invariant be defined for any non-degenerate weighted homogeneous polynomial of two variables? If so, how does one compute it? My understanding is that the delta invariant can be defined if and only if the polynomial is square-free , which leads me to yet another question: What is a square-free complex polynomial? If so, how does one reconcile the fact that the corresponding unknotting number exists but the delta invariant may not be defined, if these are suppose to be equal?

Hence by induction $(D,\mathscr{L}|_D)\cong(\mathbb{P}^{n-1},\mathscr{O}(1))$ . Hence we have $\int_Xc_1(\mathscr{L})^n=1$ .

Definition 3.1 ( In his book p.347 ). Let $S$ be a Dedekind scheme. We call an integral, projective, flat $S$ -scheme $\pi : X \to S$ of dimension $2$ a fibered surface over $S$ . The generic point of $S$ will be denoted by $\eta$ . We call $X_{\eta}$ the generic fiber of $X$ . A fiber $X_s$ with $s\in S$ closed is called a closed fiber . When $\operatorname{dim}S=1$ , $X$ is called a projective flat $S$ -curve (see Lemma  3.3). Note that the flatness of $\pi$ is equivalent to the surjectivity of $\pi$ . (C.f. Fibered surface is flat if and only if it surjects onto the base ) We will say that $X$ is normal (resp. regular ) fibered surface if $X$ is normal (resp. regular). Example 3.2. Let $S:= \operatorname{Spec}\mathbb{Z}$ and $X:=\operatorname{Proj}\mathbb{Z}[x,y,z]/(y^2z+yz^2-x^3+xz^2)$ . Let us show that $X$ is a normal fibered surface. The only point needing verification is that $X$ is normal. ( Next argument for showing normality is omitted ). I don't understand why the bold statement is true. $X$ is integral, projective scheme (over $S$ ). My question is, for $X$ to become fibered surface over $S$ , Q.1. Why $X$ has dimension $2$ ? EDIT : First attempt to the first question. Note that by the Liu's book, p.53, Lemma 3.41, letting $I :=(f(x,y,z):=y^2z+yz^2-x^3+xz^2)$ , $ \operatorname{Proj}\mathbb{Z}[x,y,z]/I$ is isomorphic to a closed subscheme of $\mathbb{P}^{2}_{\mathbb{Z}}$ , with support ( i.e., with underlying topological space) $V_{+}(I)$ . So, $\dim \operatorname{Proj}\mathbb{Z}[x,y,z]/I = \dim V_{+}(I)$ and it suffices to show that $\dim V_{+}(I)=2$ . First note that $V_{+}(I)$ is a proper closed subset of $\mathbb{P}^{2}_{\mathbb{Z}}$ (True?). So, $$  \dim V_{+}(I) < \dim \mathbb{P}^{2}_{\mathbb{Z}} = \dim Z + 2 = 3 .$$ so that $\dim V_{+}(I) \le 2$ . So it suffices to show that $ 2 \le \dim V_{+}(I)$ . Now I arrange some preliminary definitions for showing this. We set $A_{+} := \oplus_{d \ge 1} A_d$ . This is a graded ideal. More generally, if $I \subseteq A$ is a homogeneous ideal, we set $I_{+} := I \cap A_{+}$ . This is again a homogeneous ideal. A homogeneous prime ideal $\mathfrak{p} \subset A$ is called relevant if it does not contain $A_{+}$ , i.e., if $\mathfrak{p}_{+} \subsetneq A_{+}$ . Proposition 13.4. (Gortz's Algebraic Geometry, p.369) Let $A$ be a graded ring. For a subset $Y \subseteq \operatorname{Proj}A$ define $$ I_{+}(Y) := (\cap_{\mathfrak{p} \in Y} \mathfrak{p}) \cap A_{+}.$$ (2) The maps $Y \mapsto I_{+}(Y)$ and $I \mapsto V_{+}(I)$ define mutually inverse, inclusion reversing bijections between the set of homogeneous ideals $I \subseteq A_{+}$ such that $I=\operatorname{rad}(I)_{+}$ and the set of closed subsets of $\operatorname{Proj}A$ . Via this bijection, the closed irreducible subsets correspond to ideals of the form $\mathfrak{p}_{+}$ , where $\mathfrak{p}$ is relevant prime ideal. Note that $\mathbb{Z}[x,y,z]_{+} = (x,y,z)$ (True?). And note that the above $I$ is homogeneous relevant prime ( In fact $I$ is a prime ideal since $f(x,y,z):=y^2z+yz^2-x^3+xz^2$ can be viewed as $-x^3 + z^2 x + (y^2z +yz^2) \in \mathbb{Z}[y,z][x]$ and applying the Eisenstein's Criterion ) ideal of $\mathbb{Z}[x,y,z]$ such that $I = I \cap \mathbb{Z}[x,y,z]_{+} =: I_{+}$ . So we have $I = I_{+}(V_{+}(I))$ . Note that if we can find two relevant prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}_1$ , $\mathfrak{p}_2$ such that $$I = I_{+}(V_{+}(I)) \subsetneq \mathfrak{p}_{1, +} \subsetneq \mathfrak{p}_{2, +}$$ , then by the above inclusion reversing bijection, we obtain chain of closed irreducible subsets $$ V_{+}(\mathfrak{p}_{2, +}) \subsetneq V_{+}(\mathfrak{p}_{1, +}) \subsetneq V_{+}(I) .$$ ( $\divideontimes$ If $C \subseteq X$ is closed and $F \subseteq X$ is closed irreducible subset in $X$ such that $F \subseteq C$ , then $F$ is closed irreducible in $C$ . ) And so we have $ 2 \le \dim V_{+}(I)$ . And we really can find such $\mathfrak{p}_1$ , $\mathfrak{p}_2$ ? Is it possible? EDIT : Yes. It seems possible. Let $\mathfrak{p}_1 := (f, x,z)$ and $\mathfrak{p}_2:= (f,x,z,7y,7)$ where $f(x,y,z):=y^2z+yz^2-x^3+xz^2$ . Such ideals may works. C.f. Are there homogeneous prime ideals $p_1 , p_2 \nsupseteq (x,y,z)$ such that $I:=(y^2z+yz^2-x^3+xz^2) \subsetneq p_{1,+} \subsetneq p_{2,+}$? . Q.2. why $X$ is flat over $S$ ? Or equivalently (as the bold statement in the above definition 3.1.), why $X$ is surjective over $S$ ? Here I think that the morphism $\pi : X\to S$ is as : What is explicit description of the structure morphism $\operatorname{Proj}A \to \operatorname{Spec}R$? . EDIT : First attempt for the question 2 : I tried to show the flatness of $X$ over $S$ directly. Note https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/01U5 and https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0AUW . From these, it sufficient to show that there is an open cover $X = \pi^{-1}(S) = \cup_{ i \in I} U_i$ such that $\mathbb{Z} = \mathcal{O}_S(S) \to \mathcal{O}_X(U_i)$ is torsion free for all $i\in I$ . In particular, note that $X = \cup _{i \in I} D_{+}(f_i)$ where $f_i$ is homogeneous elements of $A_{+}$ where $A:= \mathbb{Z}[x,y,z]/(y^2z+yz^2-x^3+xz^2)$ . My question is, the induced ring maps $\mathbb{Z} = \mathcal{O}_S(S) \to \mathcal{O}_X(D_{+}(f_i)) = A_{(f_i)}$ is torsion free ? If so we are done. Second attempt for the question 2 : I tried to show the surjectivity of the $\pi : X \to S$ which is equivalent to the flatness, as I mentioned above. As I linked What is explicit description of the structure morphism $\operatorname{Proj}A \to \operatorname{Spec}R$? , the $\pi : X \to S$ is constructed from glueing next morphisms ( $f\in A_{+}$ homogeneous elements ) $$\psi_{f} : D_{+}(f) \xrightarrow{\cong} \operatorname{Spec}A_{(f)} \xrightarrow{^al_f} \operatorname{Spec}A_{0}= \operatorname{Spec}\mathbb{Z}$$ , where $l_f : A_0 \to A_{(f)}$ be the natural map $a \mapsto \frac{a}{1}$ . Note that $A_0 = \mathbb{Z}/(I\cap \mathbb{Z}) = \mathbb{Z}$ . To show the surjectivity of $\pi$ , let $(p)$ be a prime ideal of $\mathbb{Z}$ . Then, my question is, "" does there exists homogeneous element $ f\in A_{+}$ and there exists $\mathfrak{q} \in \operatorname{Spec}A_{(f)}$ such that $^a l_f (\mathfrak{q}) = l_f^{-1}(\mathfrak{q}) = \{n \in A_0=\mathbb{Z} : \frac{n}{1} \in \mathfrak{q} \} = (p)$ . "" ? Assume that $\{n \in A_0=\mathbb{Z} : \frac{n}{1} \in \mathfrak{q} \} = (p)$ is true for some $f$ and $\mathfrak{q}$ . Then If $np \in  (p)$ , then $\frac{np}{1} \in \mathfrak{q}$ . If $n\in l_f^{-1}(\mathfrak{q})$ so that $\frac{n}{1}\in \mathfrak{q}$ , then $n \in (p)$ From these, can we guess such $f \in A_{+}$ and $\mathfrak{q}$ ? Can any one provide such $f \in A_{+}$ and $\mathfrak{q}$ ? Third attempt for the question 2 : Now I'm trying to show the sujectivity of $\pi :X \to S$ in other direction, helped from below hint of Aphelli. Let $s= (p) \in S:= \operatorname{Spec}\mathbb{Z}$ . It suffices to show that $\pi^{-1}(s) \neq \varnothing$ . Note that by the Liu's Algebraic geometry book, p.82, Proposition 3.1.9., we have ( $I:= (y^2z+yz^2−x^3+xz^2)$ ) $$ \pi^{-1}(s) \cong \operatorname{Proj}(\mathbb{Z}[x,y,z]/I) \times _ {\operatorname{Spec}\mathbb{Z}}\operatorname{Spec}k(s) \cong \\ \operatorname{Proj}(\mathbb{Z}[x,y,z]/I \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} k(s)) \cong \operatorname{Proj}( k(s)[x,y,z]/Ik(s)[x,y,z]) \cong V_{+}(Ik(s)[x,y,z]) \subseteq \mathbb{P}^{2}_{k(s)}$$ ( C.f. The final isomorphism is true by the Liu's Lemma 2.3.41 (p.53). For the third isomorphism, see Quotients and extensions of scalars in polynomial algebras . True? ) Note that $k(s) = \mathbb{Q}$ when $p=0$ and $k(s)=\mathbb{Z}/(p)$ when $p$ is prime number. So we can view the $Ik(s)[x,y,z]$ as the principal ideal generated by $f(x,y,z):= y^2z+yz^2-x^3+xz^2$ whose coefficients are  viewed as in $\mathbb{Q}$ or $\mathbb{Z}/(p)$ . If this polynomial is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{Z}/(p)$ , then $V_{+}(Ik(s)[x,y,z]) \subseteq \mathbb{P}^{2}_{k(s)}$ is of codimension $1$ by the following thorem (Gortz's Algebraic Geometry, Corollary 5.42 ) so that it is nonempty so that $\pi^{-1}(s)$ is nonempty and we are done Corollary 5.42. Let $Z\subseteq \mathbb{P}^n_{k}$ be an integral closed subscheme. Then $Z$ is of codimension $1$ if and only if $Z=V_{+}(f)$ for an 'irreducible' homogeneous polynomial $f$ . Q. And $f(x,y,z)$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{Z}/(p)$ ? Fourth attempt for the question 2 : Through communicating with Liu, I noticed that we may use next theorem ( Corollary 4.3.10 in Liu's book ) : Corollary 4.3.10. Let $Y$ be a Dedekind scheme, and $f:X\to Y$ be a non-constant morhpism ( i.e., $f(X)$ is not reduced to a point ) with $X$ integral. Then $f$ is flat. So, my question is, the above $\pi : X \to S$ is non-constant? Is there any criteria for the non-constancy of a morphism ? P.s. I am struggling with this issue for few hours.

77,Stuck showing that Milnor's topological intersection multiplicity agrees with the algebraic definition,Stuck showing that Milnor's topological intersection multiplicity agrees with the algebraic definition,,"I am trying to solve problem 3 from Appendix B from Milnor's “Singular Points of Complex Hypersurfaces” (p. 115). This shows that Milnor's topological definition of intersection multiplicity agrees with another more algebraic one. Let $f = (f_1, \dots, f_n)$ be holomorphic functions with an isolated zero at the origin in $\mathbb C^n$ . Milnor (p. 59) defines the intersection multiplicity $\mu$ of $f_1, \dots, f_n$ at the origin as the degree of the map $$g : S^{2n-1} \to S^{2n-1}, \qquad g(x) = \dfrac {f(tx)} {\Vert f(tx) \Vert}$$ for small enough $t > 0$ . Milnor also shows (p. 113) that, for “most” values $p$ near the origin, the fiber $f^{-1}(p)$ has exactly $\mu$ points. Actually, I am not trying to solve the problem from scratch, but rather heavily reusing a proof in Ebeling's book “Functions of Several Complex Variables and Their Singularities” (pp. 150-151), which, if it goes through, then it solves the problem. By hypothesis, $f_1, \dots, f_n$ form a system of parameters of the local ring $B = \mathbb C \{ x_1, \dots, x_n \}$ . Then $B / \langle f_1, \dots, f_n \rangle$ is a finite-dimensional $\mathbb C$ -vector space, say, of dimension $d$ . The goal is to show that $d = \mu$ . Let $A = \mathbb C \{ f_1, \dots, f_n \}$ . By the Weierstrass preparation theorem for modules (p. 97), $B$ is a finite $A$ -module, minimally generated by $d$ elements. By miracle flatness (p. 109, or also Stacks Project 10.128), $B$ is freely generated by these $d$ elements. In particular, $B$ is an integral extension of $A$ . Let $K = \mathrm{Frac}(A)$ and $L = \mathrm{Frac}(B)$ . Then $L = K(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ is an algebraic extension of $K$ of degree $d$ . By the primitive element, we may write $L = K(x_0)$ , where $x_0$ is a $K$ -linear combination of $x_1, \dots, x_n$ . Then $x_0$ 's minimal polynomial $g_0 \in K[T]$ has degree $d$ . Multiplying $x_0$ times the least common denominator of $g_0$ 's coefficients, we obtain another element $y_1 \in L$ such that $L = K(y_1)$ , but whose minimal polynomial is in $A[T]$ . This implies that $y_1 \in B$ . In fact, $y_1$ is in $B$ 's maximal ideal. So far so good, but then I do not understand the next step. Ebeling claims (p. 151) that, after a change of coordinates, we may assume $x_1 = y_1$ . Equivalently, there exist $y_2, \dots, y_n \in B$ such that $y_1, \dots, y_n$ is a system of parameters that generates the whole maximal ideal $\langle x_1, \dots, x_n \rangle$ . Equivalently, $y_1$ has order $1$ . Why is this the case? Moving on to the rest of the proof. Let $g \in A[T]$ be $y_1$ 's minimal polynomial. Using Hensel's lemma (p. 73), one can show (p. 101) that $g$ 's non-leading coefficients are in $A$ 's maximal ideal. The inclusion ring map $A \to A[y_1]$ corresponds geometrically to the restriction of $$\pi : U \times \mathbb C \longrightarrow U, \qquad (f_1, \dots, f_n, y_1) \longmapsto (f_1, \dots, f_n)$$ to the hypersurface $g = 0$ . Away from the subset of $U$ where the discriminant $\Delta g$ vanishes, the fibers $\pi^{-1}(p)$ have exactly $d$ points on this hypersurface. IMO, Ebeling handwaves the last part, so I am going to try to “unhandwave” it. The inclusion ring map $A[y_1] \to B$ is a normalization map, because $A[y_1]$ and $B$ have the same field of fractions, and $B$ is integrally closed. Moreover, one constructs the normalization $B$ by adding $y_2, \dots, y_n$ , so, if we invert the product $h = y_2 \cdots y_n$ , then the localization $A[y_1]_h \to B_h$ is actually an isomorphism . In other words, geometrically, the restriction of $$\iota : V \longrightarrow U \times \mathbb C, \qquad (y_1, \dots, y_n) \longmapsto (f_1, \dots, f_n, y_1)$$ is “almost an isomorphic embedding” into the hypersurface $g = 0$ , and it actually becomes an isomorphism after we remove the points where $h = 0$ from both the domain and the codomain. Is the highlighted idea right? Finally, the composition $\pi \circ \iota : V \to U$ agrees with the original map $f$ , and it has fibers of size $d$ on an open subset of $U$ whose closure contains the origin. Therefore, $d$ agrees with Milnor's intersection multiplicity $\mu$ . Change of strategy: Instead of considering the ring extension $A \to B$ in one go, I will set $A_j = A[x_1, \dots, x_j]$ and consider the tower of extensions $$A = A_0 \longrightarrow A_1 \longrightarrow A_2 \longrightarrow \dots \longrightarrow A_n = B$$ Similarly, I will set $K_j = \mathrm{Frac}(A_j) = K(x_1, \dots, x_j)$ and consider the tower of extensions $$K = K_0 \longrightarrow K_1 \longrightarrow K_2 \longrightarrow \dots \longrightarrow K_n = L$$ By construction, $K_j = K_{j-1}(x_j)$ , hence $x_j$ 's minimal polynomial $g_j \in K_{j-1}[T]$ has degree $d_j = [K_j : K_{j-1}]$ . Geometrically, the inclusion $A_{j-1} \to A_j$ corresponds to the restriction of $$(f_1, \dots, f_n, x_1, \dots, x_j) \longmapsto (f_1, \dots, f_n, x_1, \dots, x_{j-1})$$ to the zero locus of $g_1 = \dots g_j = 0$ . Away from the subset of the codomain where the discriminant $\Delta g_j$ vanishes, the fiber over each point has exactly $d_j$ points. Therefore, the general fiber of $$(f_1, \dots, f_n, x_1, \dots, x_n) \longmapsto (f_1, \dots, f_n)$$ has exactly $\mu = d_1 \cdots d_n$ points. Finally, the map $$(x_1, \dots, x_n) \longmapsto (f_1, \dots, f_n, x_1, \dots, x_n)$$ is an isomorphism, because it is a parametrization of the graph of $f(x)$ , so we are done. Does this idea work?","I am trying to solve problem 3 from Appendix B from Milnor's “Singular Points of Complex Hypersurfaces” (p. 115). This shows that Milnor's topological definition of intersection multiplicity agrees with another more algebraic one. Let be holomorphic functions with an isolated zero at the origin in . Milnor (p. 59) defines the intersection multiplicity of at the origin as the degree of the map for small enough . Milnor also shows (p. 113) that, for “most” values near the origin, the fiber has exactly points. Actually, I am not trying to solve the problem from scratch, but rather heavily reusing a proof in Ebeling's book “Functions of Several Complex Variables and Their Singularities” (pp. 150-151), which, if it goes through, then it solves the problem. By hypothesis, form a system of parameters of the local ring . Then is a finite-dimensional -vector space, say, of dimension . The goal is to show that . Let . By the Weierstrass preparation theorem for modules (p. 97), is a finite -module, minimally generated by elements. By miracle flatness (p. 109, or also Stacks Project 10.128), is freely generated by these elements. In particular, is an integral extension of . Let and . Then is an algebraic extension of of degree . By the primitive element, we may write , where is a -linear combination of . Then 's minimal polynomial has degree . Multiplying times the least common denominator of 's coefficients, we obtain another element such that , but whose minimal polynomial is in . This implies that . In fact, is in 's maximal ideal. So far so good, but then I do not understand the next step. Ebeling claims (p. 151) that, after a change of coordinates, we may assume . Equivalently, there exist such that is a system of parameters that generates the whole maximal ideal . Equivalently, has order . Why is this the case? Moving on to the rest of the proof. Let be 's minimal polynomial. Using Hensel's lemma (p. 73), one can show (p. 101) that 's non-leading coefficients are in 's maximal ideal. The inclusion ring map corresponds geometrically to the restriction of to the hypersurface . Away from the subset of where the discriminant vanishes, the fibers have exactly points on this hypersurface. IMO, Ebeling handwaves the last part, so I am going to try to “unhandwave” it. The inclusion ring map is a normalization map, because and have the same field of fractions, and is integrally closed. Moreover, one constructs the normalization by adding , so, if we invert the product , then the localization is actually an isomorphism . In other words, geometrically, the restriction of is “almost an isomorphic embedding” into the hypersurface , and it actually becomes an isomorphism after we remove the points where from both the domain and the codomain. Is the highlighted idea right? Finally, the composition agrees with the original map , and it has fibers of size on an open subset of whose closure contains the origin. Therefore, agrees with Milnor's intersection multiplicity . Change of strategy: Instead of considering the ring extension in one go, I will set and consider the tower of extensions Similarly, I will set and consider the tower of extensions By construction, , hence 's minimal polynomial has degree . Geometrically, the inclusion corresponds to the restriction of to the zero locus of . Away from the subset of the codomain where the discriminant vanishes, the fiber over each point has exactly points. Therefore, the general fiber of has exactly points.

My question here is: are there good reasons commutative algebraists prefer to admit rings with no regular elements in their spectrum to be J-1? Alternatively, why not admit rings with no regular elements in their spectrum to be J-0? The usual tradeoff would be, of course, that it makes certain statements in the theory easier, but I do not know the particular theory that uses this or have many references to it, so I'd like to ask those of you who are familiar whether or not the tradeoff is justifiable with examples. (Note: KReiser also provided a useful sufficient condition that J-1 will imply J-0: when is a reduced ring.)",R Spec(R) Spec(R) k[x]/(x)^2 R,"['algebraic-geometry', 'ring-theory', 'commutative-algebra']"

Moreover, is there an analogous statement over other algebraically closed field where the world analytic is substituted by etale?","Let be a smooth algebraic surface over i.e a smooth and connected scheme of finite type over of dimension . I denote with the Hilbert scheme of -dimensional subscheme of length . This is known to be a smooth scheme of dim which moreover admits the Hilbert-Chow morphism: where is the symmetric product. Among the properties of it is frequently stated that this morphism restricts to a fiber bundle (in the analytic topology) when considering where via the diagonal embedding.

98,Regular differentials on a singular curve.,Regular differentials on a singular curve.,,"Please also refer to the same question over on mathoverflow.net , where I proposed a solution which is still incomplete (and not entirely correct...). Let $X'$ be an irreducible singular algebraic curve over an algebraically closed field $k$ , and let $X \to X'$ be its normalization, and consider a (singular) point $Q \in X'$ . Let $K = Q(X)$ be the function field of $X$ and $X'$ . Let $\mathcal{O}_Q' = \mathcal{O}_{X', Q}$ be the stalk of the structure sheaf of $X'$ at $Q$ , and let $\mathcal{O}_Q = \bigcap_{P \mapsto Q} \mathcal{O}_P$ be its normalization. Here $\mathcal{O}_P$ is the stalk of the structure sheaf of $X$ at $P \in X$ , and the intersection is over all points mapping to $Q$ . In his book Algebraic Groups and Class Fields , chapter IV §3, Serre introduces the module $\underline{\Omega}_Q'$ of regular differentials at $Q$ . A differential $\omega \in D_k(K)$ is called regular, iff \begin{equation}\sum_{P \mapsto Q} \operatorname{Res}_P(f \omega) = 0 \quad \text{for all} \  f\in \mathcal{O}_Q'.\end{equation} Similarly to $\mathcal{O}_Q$ , Serre defines $$ \underline{\Omega}_Q = \bigcap_{P \mapsto Q} \Omega_P.$$ Since every differential $\omega \in \underline{\Omega}_Q$ has no poles at any point $P \mapsto Q$ , clearly $\operatorname{Res}_P(f \omega) = 0$ for $f \in \mathcal{O}_Q'$ , so that $\underline{\Omega}_Q \subset \underline{\Omega}_Q'$ . Now to my question: The mapping \begin{align} \mathcal{O}_Q / \mathcal{O}_Q' \times \underline{\Omega}_Q' / \underline{\Omega}_Q & \to k \\ (f, \omega) & \mapsto \sum_{P \mapsto Q} \operatorname{Res}_P(f \omega) \end{align} is clearly bilinear and well-defined. Serre claims that it is a perfect pairing, but I don't know why. I think we have to show two things: If $f \in \mathcal{O}_Q$ , with the property that for each $\omega \in \underline{\Omega}_Q'$ , one has $\sum_P \operatorname{Res}_P(f \omega) = 0$ , then in fact $f \in \mathcal{O}_Q'$ . If $\omega \in \underline{\Omega}_Q'$ , such that for each $f \in \mathcal{O}_Q$ , one has $\sum \operatorname{Res}_P(f \omega) = 0$ , then $\omega \in \underline{\Omega}_Q$ , i.e. $\omega$ is regular at every $P \mapsto Q$ . Any help would be appreciated :)","Please also refer to the same question over on mathoverflow.net , where I proposed a solution which is still incomplete (and not entirely correct...).

99,Definition of pencil of hypersurfaces.,Definition of pencil of hypersurfaces.,,"On Voisin's book Hodge theory and complex algebraic geometry II, she defined a pencil of hypersurfaces on a variety $X$ to be a projective line $\mathbb P^1 \subset P(H^0(X, L)) =: |L|$ , where $L$ is a holomorphic line bundle on $X$ . But how is that different from the definition of a general pencil? Do we require the line bundle $L$ here from a diviosr $D$ ? (My definition of a pencil is: A pencil is a linear system of dimension $1$ , i.e. a one-dimensional linear subspace of some $|D|$ , where $|D|\subset Div(X)$ is the set of all effective divisors linearly equivalent to $D$ and $|D|\cong \mathcal{P}(L(D))\cong \mathcal{P}(H^0(X,\mathcal{O}([D]))$ .)
