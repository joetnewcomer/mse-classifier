In all other aspects the objects are identical. Determine the unique one that has the different weight using a pair of scales optimally. Show by induction on $n$ that at most $2*n$ comparisons are needed to identify the object when the total number of objects is $3^n$ My original thought was that the base case has to be $n = 1$ where we have a total of $3^1$ objects which we can figure out the one we are searching for with 2 comparisons. But the solution uses as base case $n = 0$ considering in that case that the $3^0 = 1$ object is the one we are searching for. I originally rejected $n = 0 $ as base case because with $1$ object we can't do any comparison so we can't know if it is the one we search for or not.

47,Summation indices in a proof of Incluson-Exclusion Principle,Summation indices in a proof of Incluson-Exclusion Principle,,"I rewrote (for easier time reading in the future) the proof of PIE given in my book as follows below and got tangled up in sum notation. I got questions about the $\color{purple}{\text{purple}}$ and $\color{brown}{\text{brown}}$ bits in the rewritten proof below. The expression $N_{\ge}(\emptyset)$ has no index $j$ so I think $\color{purple}{\displaystyle{\sum_{j=0}^nN_{\ge}(\emptyset)} = N_{\ge}(\emptyset)}$ because there's only one item to sum. Does that make sense? In the case of $\color{brown}{\displaystyle{N_{\ge}(J)\sum_{j=0}^n\left((-1)^m\binom nm\right) = N_{\ge}(J) \cdot 0}}$ , we have $\color{brown}{\displaystyle{\sum_{j=0}^n\left((-1)^m\binom nm\right) = 0}}$ , but the actual theorem says $\displaystyle{\sum_{j=0}^n\left((-1)^j\binom nj\right) = 0}$ and so indices don't match in the $\color{brown}{\text{brown bit}}$ . How can I make the indices match up in the $\color{brown}{\text{brown bit}}$ ? Here below is PIE as given in my book: Definition Statement of PIE Proof Here below is the rewritten proof: Let $U$ be a universe of objects and let $P = \{p_1, p_2, p_3, \ldots, p_n\}$ be a set of properties that the objects may or may not have. Let $N_=(J)$ be a set of all objects all of whose properties are in $J \subseteq P.$ Suppose $|J| = 2$ . Then some of the $N_=(J)$ s are $N_=(\{p_1, p_7\}), \ N_=(\{p_{n-1}, p_n\})$ etc. There are $\binom n2$ such $N_=(J)$ s. Generally, if $|J| = j$ , then there are $\binom njN_=(J)$ objects all of whose properties are in $J$ meaning $\color{red}{\displaystyle{\sum_{|J| = j}(-1)^jN_=(J) = (-1)^j\binom njN_=(J)}}$ . Summing both sides of the expression in $\color{red}{\text{red}}$ above, we have $$\color{blue}{\sum_{j=0}^n\left(\sum_{|J| = j}(-1)^jN_=(J)\right) = \sum_{j=0}^n(-1)^j\binom njN_=(J)}$$ Since removing $N_=(J)$ elements also removes $N_{\ge}(J)$ elements, we can replace $N_=(J)$ s in the expression $\color{blue}{\text{in blue}}$ above with $N_{\ge}(J)$ s as follows: $$\color{green}{\sum_{j=0}^n\left(\sum_{|J| = j}(-1)^jN_{\ge}(J)\right) = \sum_{j=0}^n(-1)^j\binom njN_{\ge}(J)}$$ Note that the number of objects in $U$ with none of the properties is $N_{\ge}(\emptyset)$ meaning the number of times $N_{\ge}(\emptyset)$ includes each object in $U$ is $1$ when the object has none of the properties and $0$ when the object has at least one property. If we can say the same thing about the expression $\color{green}{\text{in green}}$ above, then we can use it instead of $N_{\ge}(\emptyset)$ . Now assume an object in $U$ contains none of the properties in $P$ . Then $|J| = 0$ meaning $\displaystyle{\sum_{j=0}^n\left(\sum_{|J| = 0}(-1)^0N_{\ge}(\emptyset)\right) = \color{\purple}{\sum_{j=0}^nN_{\ge}(\emptyset) = N_{\ge}(\emptyset)}}$ . Since $N_{\ge}\emptyset$ includes each object in $U$ only $1$ time when the object has none of the properties, so does the expression $\color{green}{\text{in green}}$ above. Suppose an object in $U$ contains $m$ properties in $P$ where $1 \le m \le n$ . Then $|J| = m.$ Now $\displaystyle{\sum_{j=0}^n\left(\sum_{|J| = m}(-1)^mN_{\ge}(J)\right) = \sum_{j=0}^n\left((-1)^m\binom nmN_{\ge}(J)\right) = \color{brown}{N_{\ge}(J)\sum_{j=0}^n\left((-1)^m\binom nm\right) = N_{\ge}(J) \cdot 0} = 0}$ Thus the expression $\color{green}{\text{in green}}$ above doesn't even count an object with properties in $J$ . Edit (number of onto functions): We consider functions $\{1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots,k\} \to \{A, B, C, D\}$ . Let $A$ stand for a set of functions whose image does not contain $a$ . Define $B, C, D$ similarly. Let $N_=(\emptyset)$ be the number of elements in a set of functions whose image does not miss any of $a, b, c, d$ and $N_{\ge}(\emptyset) -$ the number of elements in  set of all functions including $\emptyset.$ Let $N_{\ge}(m_a)$ be the number of elements in a set of functions whose image misses $a$ and also possibly $b, c, d$ . In other words, $N_{\ge}(m_a) = |A|$ or $N_{\ge}(m_a) = |A \cap B|$ or $N_{\ge}(m_a) = |A \cap C \cap D|$ etc. Also, let $AB$ stand for $A \cap B.$ Now take a look at the given pics. Our goal is to count the elements in the square outside the union  of $A, B, C, D$ as shown in pic 1 . To that end start by counting all the elements in the square as shown in pic 2 , then remove the elements in the union of $A, B, C, D$ from the total number of elements. When we remove $A$ , we remove $AB$ with it. Look at pic 3 . When we remove $B$ , we remove $AB$ again. Thus removing $A \cup B$ results in us removing $AB$ twice. Generally, removing $A \cup B \cup C \cup D$ results in us removing $AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD$ twice each meaning we need to add one copy of each of $AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD$ back as we meant to remove them only once. When we remove $A$ , we remove $ABC$ with it as in pic 4 . Similarly, removing $B$ also results in removal of $ABC$ . This holds for $C$ as well meaning as we remove $A \cup B \cup C$ we also remove $ABC$ three times. But earlier we added $AB, BC, AC, AD$ back which resulted in us adding $ABC$ back four times. So, when  we remove $A \cup B \cup C \cup D$ , one copy of $ABC$ is left behind which we need to get rid of. Similarly we need to remove one copy of each of $ACD, BCD, ABD.$ Now removing $A$ results in removal of $ABCD$ with it as in pic 5 . Similarly, removing $B, C, D$ means we remove $ABCD$ three more times. Earlier, we added $AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD$ which added $ABCD$ back six times. Then we removed $ABC, BCD, ACD, ABD$ which removed $ABCD$ four times. Thus removing $A \cup B \cup C \cup D$ results in removing $ABCD$ twice meaning we need to add $ABCD$ back once. Algebraically, $$N_=(\emptyset) = \\ N_{\ge}(\emptyset) \\ - (N_{\ge}(m_a) + N_{\ge}(m_b) + N_{\ge}(m_c) + N_{\ge}(m_d)) \\ + (N_{\ge}(m_am_b) + N_{\ge}(m_am_c) + N_{\ge}(m_am_d) + (N_{\ge}(m_bm_c) + N_{\ge}(m_bm_d) + N_{\ge}(m_cm_d)) \\ - (N_{\ge}(m_am_bm_c) + N_{\ge}(m_am_bm_d) + N_{\ge}(m_bm_cm_d) + N_{\ge}(m_am_bm_d)) \\ + N_{\ge}(m_am_bm_cm_d)$$ Now note, $$N_{\ge}(m_a), \ N_{\ge}(m_b), \ N_{\ge}(m_c), \ N_{\ge}(m_d) \ge (n - 1)^k \\ N_{\ge}(m_am_b), \ N_{\ge}(m_am_c), \ N_{\ge}(m_am_d), \ (N_{\ge}(m_bm_c), \ N_{\ge}(m_bm_d), N_{\ge}(m_cm_d \ge (n - 2)^k \\ N_{\ge}(m_am_bm_c), \ N_{\ge}(m_am_bm_d), \ N_{\ge}(m_bm_cm_d), \ N_{\ge}(m_am_bm_d) \ge (n - 3)^k \\ N_{\ge}(m_am_bm_cm_d) \ge (n - 4)^k \\ N_{\ge}(\emptyset) \ge (n - 0)^k$$ Note, $n = 4$ , but we use either $n$ or $4$ depending on whichever is more instructive at the time. Thus, we have $$N_=(\emptyset) \ge \binom 40(n - 0)^k - \binom 41(n - 1)^k + \binom 42(n - 2)^k - \binom 43(n - 3)^k + \binom 44(n - 4)^k = \sum_{j=0}^4\binom 4j(-1)^j(n - j)^k$$ Finally, $N_= (m_a) = (n - 1)^k$ . However, as we saw above (when working with overlapping circles) removing an object with $N_= (m_a)$ properties results in the removal of an object with $N_{\ge} (m_a)$ properties. Thus we can replace $N_{\ge} (m_a)$ with $N_= (m_a)$ meaning $$N_=(\emptyset) = \sum_{j=0}^4\binom 4j(-1)^j(n - j)^k$$","I rewrote (for easier time reading in the future) the proof of PIE given in my book as follows below and got tangled up in sum notation.

In the case of , we have , but the actual theorem says and so indices don't match in the . How can I make the indices match up in the ?

Let be a set of all objects all of whose properties are in Suppose . Then some of the s are etc. There are such s. Generally, if , then there are objects all of whose properties are in meaning . Summing both sides of the expression in above, we have Since removing elements also removes elements, we can replace s in the expression above with s as follows: Note that the number of objects in with none of the properties is meaning the number of times includes each object in is when the object has none of the properties and when the object has at least one property. If we can say the same thing about the expression above, then we can use it instead of . Now assume an object in contains none of the properties in . Then meaning .

Let $S$ be the set of all possible bitstrings of length $n$ . Let $H(w)$ be the Hamming weight of $w$ i.e. $H(w)$ is the number of $1'$ s in the string. The space I am looking at is such that strings with same Hamming weight are close to each other. So starting from a $w$ , and after applying $f$ twice, I would want to be in $w'$ s.t. $H(w')\neq H(w)$ . So starting from a fixed $w$ , I am looking for a formula for a bijection $f:S\to S$ s.t.: $$H(f(f(w))\neq H(w)$$ For example, if $f$ is a bijection such that it flips the bits i.e. $1$ to $0$ and vice-versa then the above condition is not true. So the bijection, qualitatively, has to look like: $f$ maps $\{w: H(w)=1\}$ to $\{w:H(w)=2\}$ and map $\{w:H(w)=2\}$ to $\{w:H(w)=3\}$ and so on or something else of that kind. But obviously $$|\{w: H(w)=i\}|\neq |\{w: H(w)=j\}|\text{ for i }\neq j$$ and hence it is hard to find such a bijection. Any suggestions?

The premise is that two people, call them A and B, are playing a variant of poker where there's 3 shared cards, and then they each draw 2 cards each. In this round, the 3 shared cards are an ace of hearts, a king of hearts and a queen of spades. Player A has an ace of diamonds and a queen of clubs, so he has two pairs. Question 1: How many different pairs can player B draw that will result in a better hand than player A's? Question 2: Assume another player joins in, how many different pairs of cards can they have so that both have a better hand than player A? Now for question 1 I got the answer 27, which I'm pretty sure is wrong cause I feel like there should be a lot more. For question 2 I'm not even sure where to start. The only way I can think of doing it now is to just list out all the combinations and see which ones don't overlap but that can't be how you're supposed to do it. Thanks! EDIT: Quick explanation of how I got 27, don't have access to my notes so can't send a picture. First I looked at which poker hands that are better actually are possible to get, and they should be straight, three of a kind and two pair (ace and king). So the straights would be with a jack and 10, which I calculated by taking ${4 \choose 1}^2 = 16$ . The two pair was ${3 \choose 1} \dot {2 \choose 1} = 6$ . Now for the three of a kind I first did ${3 \choose 1} \dot {4 \choose 2} = 18$ . I wasn't sure what the best way to calculate this was, but I came to the conclusion that 13 of those combinations would be missing due to some of the cards already being taken, so $18-3 = 5$ .

This results in: Using a different approach: Draw 9 non-kings one at a time, and then draw a king I feel as though these two should produce the same numerical answer, yet the first method produces an answer(0.424) that's a factor of 10 away from the latter method(.0424) c)",10^{th} 11^{th} 10^{th} 10 3 P(10^{th}\text{ is king and }11^{th}\text { is non king}) = P(1^{st}\text{ is king and }2^{nd}\text { is non king}) \\ = \frac{4}{52} \frac{48}{51} 10^{th} 9 48 4 1 \frac{{48 \choose 9}{4 \choose 1}} {52 \choose 10} \frac{(48)(47)(46)...(40)}{(52)(51)(51)...(44)} \frac{4}{43} P(10 \text{ draws to get } 3 \text{ Kings}) = P(10^{th} = \text{King}|2 \text{Kings before})P(2 \text{ Kings before}) = \frac{2}{43} \frac{{4 \choose 2}{48 \choose 7}}{52 \choose 10},"['probability', 'combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics', 'solution-verification']"

I am not sure whether it is right or not, but after I tried many cases, it seems to be right. My first attempt is to use mathematical induction to prove that for any $c$ , all points within the square $0\le x\le c$ and $0\le y\le c$ satisfy that statement. I could prove my enumeration that $(c,c)$ with $0\le c\le 3$ satisfy the proposition.

I am not sure whether it is right or not, but after I tried many cases, it seems to be right. My first attempt is to use mathematical induction to prove that for any , all points within the square and satisfy that statement. I could prove my enumeration that with satisfy the proposition. Then under the assumption that with satisfy the proposition, I want to prove with satisfy the proposition, too. I attempted to use the idea of Dijkstra's Algorithm, by stating that all points within the square can be accessed by one step from points within the square , but it seems not a correct proof. My second attempt is to use linear equation. If , then intuitively, the knight only needs to jump rightwards and upwards, and it will the fastest way to reach . Assume the knight go steps of and steps of , which leads to a equation So . I guess this must be the minimum steps, but I still have difficulty rigorously proving this statement. I thought by solving equations in this kind will lead me to the answer, but just don't know how to continue. Could anybody offer me some hint or help? Thank you very much!","(0,0) (x,y) x\ge 0 y\ge 0 (a,b) -1\le a\le x+2 -1\le b\le y+2 c 0\le x\le c 0\le y\le c (c,c) 0\le c\le 3 (c,c) 0\le c\le n (c,c) 0\le c\le n+1 0\le c\le n+1 0\le c\le n 3|x+y (x,y) u (2,1) v (1,2) \begin{cases}2u+v=a\\u+2v=b\end{cases} u+v=\frac{a+b}{3}","['discrete-mathematics', 'graph-theory', 'algorithms', 'chessboard']"
99,Prove that relation on $\mathbb Z$ ($3a-7b$ is even) is symmetric,Prove that relation on  ( is even) is symmetric,\mathbb Z 3a-7b,"If you had a relation $R$ on $\mathbb{Z}$ defined by $aRb$ if $3a-7b$ is even how would you prove that it is symmetric? Here is my attempt: Let $y,z\in\mathbb{Z}$ assume $yRz$ then $3y-7z$ is even. This means $3y-7z=2k$ where $k\in\mathbb{Z}$ . Then, $y=\frac{2k+7z}{3}$ so, $3y-7z=3z-7(\frac{2k+7z}{3})=-\frac{2}{3}(7k+20z)$ . And that is where I stopped. How could you prove that this was even? if you factor out the two, the remaining equation is not even an integer.","If you had a relation on defined by if is even how would you prove that it is symmetric?
