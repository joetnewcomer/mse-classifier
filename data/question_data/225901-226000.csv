Let $M$ be an arbitrary abstract group and $S$ be a scheme. Let $M_S=\coprod_{i\in M}S_i$ where $S_i=S$ ,which can be constructed via glueing data of a scheme see tag 01JA .

For a constant group scheme $M_S$ , its dual is denoted as $D(M)$ or $D_S(M)$ and they are precisely the diagonalizable group schemes. In particular, it exists and $\DeclareMathOperator{\Spec}{Spec}D_S(M)\cong \Spec \mathbb{Z}[M]\times_{\Spec \mathbb{Z}}S$ where $\mathbb{Z}[M]$ is the group ring $\bigoplus_{i\in M}\mathbb{Z}_i$ with an obvious ring structure. Note that $D_S(M)$ is always commutative no matter whether $M$ is commutative. It's known in a few reference that if $M$ is commutative then $D_SD_S(M)=M_S$ i.e. $M_S$ is reflexive. (e.g. SGA3,Expose VIII,Page 3,Theoreme 1.2 or [Groupe Algeacutebriques by Demazure and Gabriel, Chap II,§2,2.11 Dualite des groupes diagonalisables]). But none of the proof seems convincing. And I seem to find a counterexample in some sense. From my understanding of the corresponding between $\DeclareMathOperator{\itSpec}{\mathit{Spec}}D_SD_S(M)(T)=\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathrm{Gr}-T}(\itSpec_{\mathcal{O}_T}\mathcal{O}_T[M],\mathbb{G}_m)$ and $M_S(T)$ . A element in $\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathrm{Gr}-T}(\itSpec_{\mathcal{O}_T}\mathcal{O}_T[M],\mathbb{G}_m)$ corresponds to a map of $\mathcal{O}_T$ -algebras $f:\mathcal{O}_T[t,t^{-1}]\to \mathcal{O}_T[M]=\bigoplus_{i\in M}\mathcal{O}_T$ s.t. $\epsilon f(t)=1$ and $\Delta(f(t))=f(t)\otimes f(t)$ . If we write $f(t)=\sum_{i\in M}a_i\cdot e_i\in \bigoplus_{i\in M}\mathcal{O}_T(T)$ then we have $a_i \cdot a_j=\delta_{ij}a_i$ and $1=\sum_i a_i$ (so each $a_i$ is an idempotent element in $\mathcal{O}_T(T)$ ). Clearly $\forall s\in T,1|_s=\sum_i a_i|_s$ so at least one of $a_i$ is supported on $s$ . And $T_{s_i} \cap T_{s_j}=T_{s_is_j}=T_0=\emptyset$ . So $(T_{s_i})_{i\in M}$ forms a disjoint open cover of $T$ which can be identified with a locally constant function from $T$ to $M$ .

67,Exercise 11.1.G Vakil FOAG,Exercise 11.1.G Vakil FOAG,,"I am trying to solve Ex 11.1.G from Ravi Vakil's FOAG. It says if $X$ is an affine scheme over $k$ , a field and $K|_k$ is an algebraic field extension, then $X$ is of pure dimension $n$ iff $X_K:=X\times_k K$ is of pure dimension $n$ . Here's my attempt at a solution. Let $X=\operatorname{Spec}A$ . Then $X_K=\operatorname{Spec}(A\otimes_k K)$ . The canonical map $X_K \rightarrow X$ , in this case corresponds to the homomorphism of $k$ -algebras namely $A\rightarrow A\otimes_k K$ ; $a\mapsto a\otimes 1$ Since $K|_k$ is an integral extension, so is $A\otimes_k K|_A$ . Thus the Going-Up theorem holds true. Also since $K$ is a free $k$ -module, $A\otimes_k K$ is a free $A$ -module and faithfully flat. Since $A\hookrightarrow A\otimes_k K$ is a flat ring extension, the Going-Down theorem holds true. Now say $P$ be a minimal prime ideal of $A\otimes_k K$ . Then $p:=P \cap A$ is a minimal prime ideal of $A$ by Going-Down theorem. Conversely if $p$ is a minimal prime of $A$ and $P$ lies over $p$ (since it is an integral extension) then $P$ is a minimal prime ideal of $A\otimes _k K$ by Incomparability. Assume $X$ is of pure dimension $n$ . Then for any minimal prime $p$ of $A$ , we have $\operatorname{coht}p=\dim X$ . If $P$ is a minimal prime of $A\otimes _k K$ , then $\operatorname{coht} P =\operatorname{coht} P\cap A=\dim X $ by Going-Up Theorem and Incomparability. Thus $X_K$ is of pure dimension $n$ as well. Now assume $X_K$ is of pure dimension $n$ . Then if $p$ is a minimal prime ideal of $A$ , then $p=P\cap A$ where $P$ is a minimal prime of $A\otimes_k K$ . Again by Going-Up and Incomparability, we get $\dim X_K=\operatorname{coht}P=\operatorname{coht} P\cap A $ . Thus $X$ is of pure dimension $n$ . I hope this is a correct solution. I am pretty sure there exists alternative solution along the lines of Vakil's hints or preferably without using flatness since Vakil does not develop it upto this point but I simply can't get it. To be more precise, Vakil has first asked to reduce the problem to $A$ being an integral domain. I am stuck with this part without using the Going-Down theorem for flat ring extensions.

I found myself stuck quite close to the end of the proof with a few statements that seem to be elementary number theoretic in nature. We have an elliptic curve $$Y^{2} = F(X) = X^{3} + AX + B$$ and define $\mathbb{Q}[\Theta] := Q[T]/F(X) $ with $ \Theta$ as the image of $X$ . Moreover, we define $M \subset \mathbb{Q}[\Theta]^*/(\mathbb{Q}[\Theta]^*)^{2}$ as the subgroup of all $\alpha(\mathbb{Q}[\Theta]^*)^2$ for which $Norm(\alpha)\in(\mathbb{Q}^*)^{2}$ . (The Norm is defined to be the determinant of the multiplication with $\alpha$ , seen as a linear map over the 3-dim. vector space $\mathbb{Q}[\Theta]$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ ). The clue of the proof is then to construct a homomorphism $$\mu: E(\mathbb{Q})\to M$$ with the properties $\mu(O) = 1(\mathbb{Q}[\Theta]^*)^2$ $\mu(a,b) = (a-\Theta)(\mathbb{Q}[\Theta]^*)^2$ if $b\neq0$ and since we can view $\mathbb{Q}[\Theta]$ as a direct sum of fields, if $(a,0)\in E(\mathbb{Q})$ , then $ F(a)=0$ and one component of $a-\Theta$ is $0$ . This one shall be patched with any element of $\mathbb{Q}^*$ so that the resulting Norm is in $(\mathbb{Q}^*)^2$ . Cassels then goes on to proove that $ker(\mu)=2E(\mathbb{Q})$ and the only thing left to proove is that $im(\mu)$ is finite: final part of Cassels' proof I cant wrap my head around why $gcd\{(r-e_{1}t^2),(r-e_{2}t^2)\}$ divides $(e_{1} - e_{2})$ and why it follows that $r-e_{j}=d_{j}v_{j}^2$ .

Moreover, we define as the subgroup of all for which . (The Norm is defined to be the determinant of the multiplication with , seen as a linear map over the 3-dim. vector space over ). The clue of the proof is then to construct a homomorphism with the properties if and since we can view as a direct sum of fields, if , then and one component of is . This one shall be patched with any element of so that the resulting Norm is in . Cassels then goes on to proove that and the only thing left to proove is that is finite: final part of Cassels' proof I cant wrap my head around why divides and why it follows that . Also, how does this help in concluding that the image is finite? I'm not sure if this proof is leaving out a few important details or if there's just a major misunderstanding on my side. It'd certainly be awesome if someone who knows/understands this proof could help me! Thanks in advance!
