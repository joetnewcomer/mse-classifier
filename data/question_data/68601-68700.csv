0,Why can we always take the zero section of a vector bundle?,Why can we always take the zero section of a vector bundle?,,"$\require{AMScd}$ As I understand it, a rank $k$ vector bundle is a pair of topological spaces with a map between them $$ E\xrightarrow{p}B $$ such that there exists an open cover $(U_\alpha)$ of $B$ over which $E$ locally looks like $U_\alpha\times\mathbb R^k$.  Precisely, we have homeomorphisms $$ \phi_\alpha\colon p^{-1}(U_\alpha)\to U_\alpha\times\mathbb R^k $$ such that the diagram \begin{CD} p^{-1}(U_\alpha) @>\phi_\alpha>> U_\alpha\times\mathbb R^k\\ @VVbV @VV\text{pr}_1V\\ U_\alpha @>\text{id}>> U_\alpha \end{CD} commutes (I can't do diagonal arrows). A section of the vector bundle is a continuous map $s\colon B\to E$ such that $p\circ s=\text{id}_B$.  A basic fact about vector bundles is that every vector bundle admits at least one section, namely the zero section, obtained by identifying each $p^{-1}(U_\alpha)$ with $U_\alpha\times\mathbb R^k$ and taking $s(b)=0$.  Explicitly, we are taking: $$ s(b)=\phi_\alpha^{-1}((b,0)) $$ for $b\in U_\alpha$. But in order to get a well defined continuous map, we need to ensure that $\phi_\alpha^{-1}(b,0)=\phi_\beta^{-1}(b,0)$ if $b\in U_\alpha\cap U_\beta$.  Now one thing we certainly can't do is require that $\phi_\alpha$ and $\phi_\beta$ actually agree on the intersection - then we could glue them all together to get a global trivialization of the bundle, which we can't do in general.  Why then are we able to insist that they agree at a certain point?  To me, it seems equivalent to the existence of a global section, and hence completely circular. There must be something obvious I'm missing.  In the meantime, here's an equivalent formulation of the problem: we define an affine bundle $E\xrightarrow{p}B$ to be the same as a vector bundle, but we identify the fibres with $k$-dimensional affine linear subspaces of some fixed real vector spaces.  So they needn't contain a special zero point. Since affine spaces are homeomorphic to vector spaces of the same dimension, any rank $k$ affine bundle is isomorphic to some rank $k$ vector bundle ( though I'm not at all sure about whether this is true, for similar reasons ).  So an affine bundle should admit a global section, but there is no easy way to see how to get one.","$\require{AMScd}$ As I understand it, a rank $k$ vector bundle is a pair of topological spaces with a map between them $$ E\xrightarrow{p}B $$ such that there exists an open cover $(U_\alpha)$ of $B$ over which $E$ locally looks like $U_\alpha\times\mathbb R^k$.

So trying to figure this out definitely made my brain hurt.  I believe that as a subspace of $\mathbb{R_l} \times \mathbb{R}$, all non-vertical straight lines just inherit the lower limit topology $\mathbb{R_l}$, while vertical lines inherit the standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$.  As for $\mathbb{R_l} \times \mathbb{R_l}$, as far as I can tell, the only difference is that now all straight lines, including vertical ones, inherit the lower limit topology. My reasoning was basically that for $\mathbb{R_l} \times \mathbb{R}$, open sets on the line all have an initial left end point, since the x-coordinate of this left end point is always captured by the open sets [a,b) in $\mathbb{R_l}$, and this in turn drags the y-coordinate of the initial left end point along for the ride (so to speak).  This is true in all but the vertical line case where there is no shift in the horizontal direction and thus the topology is inherited strictly from $\mathbb{R}$.

7,How is a doubly twisted cylinder different from a cylinder?,How is a doubly twisted cylinder different from a cylinder?,,"Imagine bending a square sheet of paper and gluing two opposite edges together. The most natural way to do this results in a cylinder with open ends. Call this object $C_0$. If one twists the sheet one half turn ($180^{\circ}$) and glues the edges, one obtains a Mobius band. Call that object $C_1$. It's easy to imagine object $C_n$ with $n$ twists. Notice that $C_n$ is homeomorphic to $C_m$ whenever $m-n$ is even, since the gluing identifications are the same. In particular, $C_0$ and $C_2$ are homeomorphic. Thus, topologically, $C_0$ and $C_2$ are equivalent. But intuitively, they strike me as different: one cannot continuously deform $C_0$ into $C_2$ without ripping the paper or some such thing. My (soft) question: what's the best way to understand this difference between $C_0$ and $C_2$? I'm clearly thinking of $C_0$ and $C_2$ as embeddings of $S^1\times[0,1]$ into $\mathbb{R}^3$. I think one can describe the difference between $C_0$ and $C_2$ as a difference between their embedding maps -- they're not homotopic in some way. (I'm not sure exactly how to formulate the non-equivalence of the embeddings.) But does one even need to refer to embeddings to capture the difference between $C_0$ and $C_2$?  Intuitively, it seems to me the difference is largely, if not completely, independent of the space in which they're embedded. I'm inspired by the beautiful way manifold theory is built up without ever needing to describe the manifold as embedded in a higher dimensional space. Can one distinguish between $C_0$ and $C_2$ without embedding them, or at least showing that the distinction is independent of the space in which they're embedded?","Imagine bending a square sheet of paper and gluing two opposite edges together.

Each commutative $C^*$ -algebra $A$ has a spectrum $\Delta$ consisting of its non-zero complex homomorphisms, which is a locally compact Hausdorff space with the Gelfand topology. Conversely, for each locally compact Hausdorff space $X$ , the algebra of continuous complex-valued functions on $X$ that vanish at infinity forms a commutative $C^*$ -algebra $C_0(X)$ w.r.t. pointwise conjugation and the supremum norm $f\mapsto\|f\|_\infty$ . The Abstract Spectral Theorem (Theorem 2.13 here ) states that each commutative $C^*$ -algebra $A$ with (necessarily non-empty) spectrum $\Delta$ is canonically isomorphic to $C_0(\Delta)$ . This isomorphism is induced by the Gelfand transforms. Conversely, mapping each $x\in X$ to its point evaluation $f\mapsto f(x):C_0(X)\to\mathbb{C}$ gives a canonical homeomorphism $X\to \Delta(C_0(X))$ . In a similar manner, we can match up proper continuous maps between LCH spaces with $*$ -homomorphisms, and find that $C_0$ is a two-way contravariant functor from the category of LCH spaces to the category of commutative $C^*$ -algebras.

The relevant part of the post is paraphrased below. Definition: A touch relation on a set $X$ is a binary relation $\lessdot$ between the members of $X$ and the subsets of $X$ (we read $x \lessdot A$ as ""$x$ touches $A$"") that satisfies the following axioms: No element of $X$ touches the empty set. If $x \in A$, then $x \lessdot A$. If $x \lessdot (A \cup B)$, then $x \lessdot A$ or $x \lessdot B$. If $x \lessdot A$ and every element of $A$ touches $B$, then $x \lessdot B$. I would like to prove that these axioms are indeed equivalent to the usual axioms for a topology in terms of open sets. To do this, I need to exhibit for any given set $X$ a bijective correspondence between touch relations on $X$ and topologies on $X$. I believe the correct correspondence is as follows: Given a touch relation on $X$, we obtain a topology on $X$ by declaring $A \subseteq X$ to be open if and only if no member of $A$ touches $X \setminus A$. Given a topology on $X$, we obtain a touch relation on $X$ by declaring that $x \lessdot A$ if and only if $x \in \overline{A}$, where $\overline{A}$ denotes the topological clousure (intersection of all closed supersets) of $A$. So far I have been able to show that both of these maps are well-defined (i.e., that they do produce a topology from a touch relation and vice versa). I can also show that the first map is a left inverse of the second (i.e., by starting from a topology $T$ on $X$, constructing the touch relation $\lessdot$ induced by $T$, and then constructing the topology $T'$ induced by $\lessdot$, we always have that $T = T'$). To finish off the proof, I need to show that the first map is a right inverse of the second, which I haven't yet figured out how to do. If I've unwound the definitions correctly, showing that the touch relation $\to$ topology $\to$ touch relation round-trip is the identity map amounts to proving the following: If $\lessdot$ is a touch relation on $X$, then $x \lessdot A$ if and only if $x$ is a member of every superset $B$ of $A$ with the property that $b \lessdot B \implies b \in B$.

Then, as a plain abelian group, $G = \varinjlim_{n} G_n= \mathbb{Q} \times \prod'\mathbb{R}$ , where $\prod'\mathbb{R}$ denotes the weak or restricted product, which is the way guys in this area call the direct sum ; that is, elements of $\prod'\mathbb{R}$ are infinite tuples $( x_1, \dots , x_n, \dots )$ , in which all of its components $x_n \in \mathbb{R}$ are zero, except a finite number of them. The inductive limit topology is the finest one that makes all the inclusions $G_n \hookrightarrow G$ continuous. That is, $U \subset G$ is open if and only if $U\cap G_n$ is open for all $n$ . Let's see how they show that, with this inductive topology, the ""product"" (in fact, addition) $\mu : G \times G \longrightarrow G$ is not continuous ( $\mu$ is the operation induced as an honest colimit of groups -no topologies- by the operations $\mu_n : G_n \times G_n \longrightarrow G_n$ , which I assume are the usual additions of those linear spaces). In plain English: $$ (x_0, x_1, \dots , x_n , \dots ) + (y_0, y_1, \dots , y_n , \dots ) = (x_0+y_0, x_1 + y_1 , \dots , x_n + y_n , \dots ) \ . $$ So, in this situation it's enough to produce an open neighbourhood $U \subset G$ of the neutral element $e \in G$ such that $V^2$ is not in $U$ , for any open neighbourhood $V$ of $e$ -where, I assume, $V^2$ means $V + V$ . Ok, here is the guy that is supposed to ruin (and sure it does) my naive attempt: $$ U = \left\{  x = (x_0, x_1, \dots , x_n , \dots ) \quad \vert \quad \vert x_j\vert < \vert \cos (jx_0) \vert \ , 1 \leq j \right\}  \ . $$ This guy is an open set of $G$ because $x_0$ being a rational number guarantees $\cos (jx_0) \neq 0$ for all $j$ . Assume there is an open neighbourhood $V$ of $e$ such that $V^2 \subset U$ . Then, $V \cap G_j$ contains an open interval $(-\varepsilon_j , \varepsilon_j)$ in $\mathbb{R}$ with $\epsilon_j > 0$ such that $$ (-\varepsilon_0 , \varepsilon_0) \times (-\varepsilon_j , \varepsilon_j) \subset  \left\{ (x_0 , x_j) \in \mathbb{Q} \times \mathbb{R} \quad \vert \quad \vert x_j\vert < \vert \cos (jx_0) \vert \right\}  \ . $$ And here come the two final sentences of the example I don't understand: This is impossible if $2j\varepsilon_0 > \pi$ . A contradiction. Any hints or remarks (even humiliating ones) will be welcome.","In Direct limit , Martin rightly pointed out that my naive construction (now deleted) of the colimit (direct limit) of topological abelian groups was wrong. He shows how to do it properly (at least the coproduct) here . Since then, I've been lurking some of the literature about the subject and this problem of the colimit of topological groups (about which I had previously no idea) seems at the same time classical and topical. For instance, this 1998's paper points out that the Encyclopedic Dictionary of Mathematics, second edition, MIT (1987), article 210, has made the same mistake that I did, stating that the direct limit of topological groups, with the inductive limit of topologies (my naive attempt) has always a continuous multiplication.

The argument is easy: $f$ is entire and never zero, so $f'/f$ is entire, so $g(z)=\int_0^z f'(\zeta)d\zeta/f(\zeta)$ is well-defined and entire, and then computation shows that $fe^{-g}$ has derivative zero, so is constant, so $f$ is a constant multiple of $e^g$, and the constant can be absorbed into $g$. The argument does not mention the topology of the situation, and this bugs me a little.  By the Little Picard theorem, the image of $f$ is the whole complex plane minus zero.  In general, of course, a continuous single-valued branch of $\log$ cannot be defined on this set. That's why the proof involved the integral of the logarithmic derivative of $f$, rather than merely the composition of $f$ with the right branch of $\log$.  That said, if we obtained a different function $h$ by picking some branch of $\log$ defined on $\mathbb{C}$ minus some ray from the origin (call this set $S$), and then defining $h(z)=\log f(z)$ on $f^{-1}(S)$, then of course $h$ would satisfy $f=e^h$ where it is defined, and then $1=e^{h-g}$, so that on each connected component of $f^{-1}(S)$, since $h,g$ are defined and continuous they must differ by a constant multiple of $2\pi i$. If I allow myself to use a different branch of $\log$ for each connected component of $f^{-1}(S)$, I could end up with $h$ exactly equaling $g$ and therefore being extendable by continuity to all of $\mathbb{C}$. What this adds up to is that I have the strong feeling that the theorem (in spite of the easy calculation-based proof) has some nontrivial topological content and I am trying to isolate this content. At this point, I was originally going to ask for help isolating the topological content.  But over the course of composing the question, I think I may have answered it. So, following is what I believe to be an alternative proof of the original result that makes the topological content explicit. My question is now, is the following proof correct? I would also be interested in your thoughts about (soft-question) where is the topology hiding in the original proof? Theorem: If $f$ is entire and never zero it has the form $f=e^g$ for $g$ entire. Proof: Let $f$ be an entire function that is never zero.  Then $f:\mathbb{C}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\}$ is continuous, so induces a homomorphism $f_*:\pi_1(\mathbb{C})\rightarrow\pi_1(\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\})$, which is trivial because $\mathbb{C}$ is simply connected.  Therefore, $f$ lifts to a continuous function $\hat{f}$ from $\mathbb{C}$ to $\mathbb{C}\setminus{0}$'s universal cover $U$. But $U$ is the Riemann surface of the $\log$ function; in particular, the logarithm is well-defined and single-valued on $U$; so let $g=\log \hat{f}$; and then $g$ is such that $f=e^g$. $\hat{f}$ is actually holomorphic to $U$, so the $g$ thus defined is entire. EDIT: When I wrote this proof I was a little uncomfortable with speaking of $\hat{f}$ being holomorphic to $U$ and the log being holomorphic on $U$, since my understanding of covering space theory is strictly topological. Subsequently I realized that we can actually take $U$ to be $\mathbb{C}$, with the covering map given by $z\mapsto e^z$, and then the ""logarithm on $U$"" is just the identity on $\mathbb{C}$. I think the argument goes through, but can be made even shorter: By the lifting theorem, any function $f$ from a simply connected domain to $\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\}$ has a lift $\hat{f}$ to $\mathbb{C}\setminus{0}$'s universal cover, $\mathbb{C}$, that factors through the covering map $z\mapsto e^z$. Then $f=e^{\hat{f}}$ and $\hat{f}$ is the desired $g$. Since the covering map is holomorphic, $f$ and $\hat{f}$ are simultaneously holomorphic. Done! Thanks to Jonas Meyer for highlighting that the key feature of the original argument is also the simple-connectedness of the domain, on which rests the invocation of Cauchy's theorem to show the integral is well-defined.","There is a standard theorem that says if $f$ is analytic in the whole complex plane and never zero, then it has the form $e^g$ where $g$ is analytic in the whole plane; i.e. we can define a function $\log f$ that is analytic in the whole plane and satisfies $f=e^{\log f}$.

53,Can you really construct a Möbius strip from this model?,Can you really construct a Möbius strip from this model?,,"I was reminded by question 77569 about something that has bothered me off and on for a while now. Consider the model of the projective plane given by the last diagram on page 37 of these notes (it's just a lens-shape in the plane, with opposite sides identified in a ""chasing"" way): Now if you remove an open disk from it, what's left, call it $M$, is homeomorphic to a Möbius strip. Unlike the projective plane, the Möbius strip can be embedded in ${\bf R}^3$ with no self-intersections. So it's natural to ask whether you can use the model $M$ to construct a physical Möbius strip. That is, does the presence of the hole make it possible to carry out in 3-space the indicated identification of edges, without tearing or self-intersection, provided the material being used is sufficiently elastic. Experiments with paper have not been encouraging. Is there some obstruction to making a Möbius strip from $M$? Another plane model for a Möbius strip is a triangle with 2 edges identified ""chasing"" and one edge unidentified. The 2nd figure on page 40 of those notes will do as an illustration.

The questions are about using the other models to make a Möbius strip.","I was reminded by question 77569 about something that has bothered me off and on for a while now. Consider the model of the projective plane given by the last diagram on page 37 of these notes (it's just a lens-shape in the plane, with opposite sides identified in a ""chasing"" way): Now if you remove an open disk from it, what's left, call it $M$, is homeomorphic to a Möbius strip. Unlike the projective plane, the Möbius strip can be embedded in ${\bf R}^3$ with no self-intersections. So it's natural to ask whether you can use the model $M$ to construct a physical Möbius strip. That is, does the presence of the hole make it possible to carry out in 3-space the indicated identification of edges, without tearing or self-intersection, provided the material being used is sufficiently elastic. Experiments with paper have not been encouraging. Is there some obstruction to making a Möbius strip from $M$? Another plane model for a Möbius strip is a triangle with 2 edges identified ""chasing"" and one edge unidentified. The 2nd figure on page 40 of those notes will do as an illustration. Again, I haven't been able to carry out the identification with paper in 3-space; is it possible? or is there some obstruction?

By the way $N_{r}(d_j)\subset N_{{\varepsilon_x}}(x)\subset U$ for $r\in \mathbb{Q}$ and $r<{\varepsilon_x}/{4}$. Thus for every $x\in U$ we associate an open ball with center at some point $d_j$ of $D$ and rational radius $r$ such that $x\in N_{r}(d_j)\subset N_{{\varepsilon_x}}(x)\subset U$. Thus $$U=\bigcup\limits_{d_j\in U} N_{r_j}(d_j).$$ This set equality can be verified very easy. Inclusion $\subseteq$ I described in above paragraph.

My guess is that it is either independent of ZFC or it is provably false for all cardinals of size at least , using some notion of path-connectivity. Edit: By the Kowalski's theorem , any space with a basis of cardinality , so notably any space of cardinality , can be embedded in the product of countably many -Hedgehog spaces. There is a simple proof of this theorem based mostly on the fact that any metrizable space has a -discrete basis. Hence, we have a positive answer for all cardinals such that . The question is still open for the other cardinals.

The Hilbert space $H$ is the set of sequences $(x_i) \in \mathbb R ^\omega$ such that $\|x\|=\sum _{i=1} ^\infty x_i ^2<\infty$, with metric $d(x,y)=\sqrt{\sum_{i=1} ^\infty (x_i-y_i)^2}$. Let $X$ be the subspace of $H$ consisting of the sequences of rationals. Observe that by assigning a point $(x_i)\in X$ with the same point in $\mathbb Q ^\omega$ one defines a continuous mapping and deduce that there is a one-to-one continuous mapping $f:X\to C$ of $X$ into the Cantor set $C$ such that $f(x_0)=0$.
