1,Can I only apply the Gauss-Hermite routine with an infinite interval or can I transform the interval?,Can I only apply the Gauss-Hermite routine with an infinite interval or can I transform the interval?,,"Short version of my question Can I only apply the Gauss-Hermite routine with an infinite interval or can I transform the interval?

So I ventured into this field and implemented the midpoint, the Simpson, and the Gauss-Legendre routine successfully.

Given that the interval is well defined, I don't see any problem using that for any interval.

4,Calculating the Haar integral on $SU(2)$ in practice,Calculating the Haar integral on  in practice,SU(2),"I'm trying to calculate the Haar integral on $SU(2)$ of a given function $f: SU(2) \to \mathbb{R}$ .

So if I were to calculate the Haar integral $\int_{SU(2)} f(A)dA$ , I'd ideally want to equate it to an integral over $T$ in some way, that is $$\int_{SU(2)} f(A)dA = \int_{T} f(A') \omega(A') dA' = \int_{0}^{2 \pi} \overline{f}(z) \overline{\omega}(z)dz$$ Where $\omega$ is some kind of weight function quantifiying how common $A' \in T$ is a conjugate of $A \in SU(2)$ over all of $SU(2)$ .

23,"Inverting Fourier transform ""on circles""","Inverting Fourier transform ""on circles""",,"Dear Math enthusiasts, I am struggeling with a problem for which a solution is already given to me, but I can just not see why it is true. Here is the setting: I am given a function $f(x,y,t)$ . It's well behaved let's say. Smooth and things like that. Now, this function should be reexpressed in the following form $$f(x,y,t) = \int g(k_x,k_y,w) {\rm e}^{-\jmath (k_x x + k_y y - w t)} d k_x dk_y dw. \tag{1}\label{eq1}$$ If it were only this it would be very simple, $g$ is some sort of 3-D Fourier transform of $f$ . However, the trouble is that the variables $k_x, k_y, w$ are not independent. They need to satisfy the relation $k_x^2 + k_y^2 = w^2$ . Therefore, I would claim that the correct form of the above expression should be $$f(x,y,t) = \int \oint_{S(w)} g(k_x,k_y,w) {\rm e}^{-\jmath (k_x x + k_y y - w t)} d \begin{bmatrix} k_x\\ k_y\end{bmatrix}  dw,\tag{2}\label{eq2}$$ where $S(w)$ is a circle of radius $w$ , so that the inner integral goes over the perimeter of the circle and the outer over circle radii. My question is essentially: given a target function $f(x,y,t)$ , how do I find $g(k_x, k_y, w)$ such that \eqref{eq2} is true for every point $x,y,t$ ? The reference I have for this simply redefines $g(k_y,k_y,w)$ into $h(k_x,w)$ since only two variables are independent (I'm assuming this means $h(k_x,w)=g(k_x,\pm \sqrt{w^2-k_x^2},w)$ though that's never written) and uses this in the first integral. This leads to $$f(x,y,t) = \int \int h(k_x,w) {\rm e}^{-\jmath (k_x x+k_y y - w t)} d  k_x  dw = \int \int \tilde{g}(k_x,y,w)  {\rm e}^{-\jmath (k_x x - w t)} d  k_x  dw,\tag{3}\label{eq3}$$ where $\tilde{g}(k_x,y,w) = h(k_x,w) {\rm e}^{-\jmath k_y y} $ (again, omitting the argument $k_y$ for me can only mean the implicit relation $k_y = \pm \sqrt{w^2-k_x^2}$ ). From \eqref{eq3}, they claim that $f$ is the 2-D Fourier transform of $\tilde{g}$ along the first and third dimension so that all we need to do to find $\tilde{g}$ is $$ \tilde{g}(k_x,y,w) = \frac{1}{4\pi^2} \int \int f(x,y,t) {\rm e}^{\jmath (k_x x-wt)} dx dt \tag{4}\label{eq4}$$ which gives $h$ as $ h(k_x,w) = \tilde{g}(k_x,y,w) {\rm e}^{\jmath k_y y} $ . However, I have the feeling this is oversimplifying things a bit. I'm lacking rigor. My feeling is that the original problem \eqref{eq2} may not have a unique solution (due to the variable dependence) and a particular one was chosen here. Integration limits are always skipped which may be a delicate issue (after all, $k_x$ should never leave the interval $[-w,w]$ , maybe this can be solved by defining $h$ zero outside this support). The fact that we cannot directly solve for $k_y$ (due to the $\pm$ ) troubles me. Overall I have a vague feeling that this may work but I cannot quite put my finger on it and really understand what's going on. Would anyone be able to enlighten me how to treat such problems rigorously? edit : A concrete example I am interested in is the function $f(x,y,t)={\rm e}^{-\jmath \left(\omega_0 t - \frac{\omega_0}{c}\sqrt{(x-x_0)^2+(y-y_0)^2}\right)}$ .

M: Your note helped a lot to remove the log jam in my head but there are still some issues that remain with my answer. I would very much appreciate your comments on my 2nd attempt. 2nd Attempt (Step 1) The function $f(z)$ can be decomposed using partial fractions: $$f(z) = \frac{R + z}{z(R - z)}  = \frac{1}{z} + \frac{2}{R - z}$$ and then integrated with respect to $z$: $$\int f(z)dz = log(z) - 2log(R - z) $$ (Step 2) With this information we can evaluate: $$\int_C f(z)dz $$ where C is the positively oriented circle $z = re^{i\theta}$. Because log(z) is not defined at its branch cut we cannot integrate around the whole circle but must split the circle into halves $C_1$ and $C_2$.

Therefore: $$ \int_{C_1} f(z) = [log(z) - 2log(R - z)]_{-ri}^{ri} $$ which equals: $$ \int_{C_1} f(z)dz = \pi{i} - 2log(R - ri) + 2log(R + ri) $$ Let $C_2$ denote the left half of the circle where $\frac{\pi}{2} <= \theta <= \frac{3\pi}{2}$ and consider the branch: $log(z) = ln(r) + i\theta$ where $0 <= \theta <= 2\pi$. Therefore: $$ \int_{C_2} f(z) = [log(z) - 2log(R - z)]_{ri}^{-ri} $$ which equals: $$ \int_{C_2} f(z)dz = \pi{i} - 2log(R + ri) + 2log(R - ri) $$ and since: $$ \int_{C} f(z)dz = \int_{C_1} f(z)dz + \int_{C_2} f(z)dz  $$ it follows that: $$ \int_{C} f(z)dz = 2\pi{i}  $$ (Step 3) This is the part I am currently having difficulty with: Does the equation: $$\int_C f(z) \mathrm{d}z  =  \int_a^bf(z(t))\cdot f'(t) dt $$ imply that: $$\Im\int_C f(z) \mathrm{d}z  =  \int_a^b\Im[{f(z(t))}\cdot f'(t) dt] $$ Because if it did I could say that: $$ \Im(2\pi{i}) = \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{R^2-r^2}{R^2 - 2Rr\cos(\theta) + r^2}\mathrm{d}\theta   $$ and the proof would be complete...But I dont know if I can do this?

For example, if I let $|\varepsilon|\ll1$ my bounds in $u$ are different, but just barely. I would expect this to fail as well even though the bounds are different.

92,What IS the value of a complex line integral?,What IS the value of a complex line integral?,,"The value of a line integral in vector calculus can be seen as ""the sum of how much the of a vector valued function affects every point of the curve"". I know this is not a mathematical definition, but it helps in giving a mental picture of what the value of the integral is. It can also be related to physics, we can for example think of a particle moving in a streaming fluid, then the line integral is the sum of the work done on the particle by the force of the fluid along the line the particle moves. So for example if the fluid has a very strong force along with the movement of the particle, then the value of the line integral will be large, while if it's weak it will be small. It's easy to see the correlation between the math and the physics here. However, when it comes to complex line integrals, I find it hard to even find a definition in words of it that can be related to making a mental picture of it, and even less connected to some physical example. I mean if we calculate a complex line integral, like $$ \int_C f(z) dz=S $$ Then what IS the value $S$? In a regular integral it's easy to say for example ""it's the area under the function curve"", and in a real valued line integral it can be said to be the total work done on a particle, for example. But when it's a complex line integral, WHAT IS IT that has actually been calculated? What does the size of the value $S$ mean? If $S$ is a big or small number, what does that signify about the function and the curve that can be visualized geometrically and give a mental picture of it? I want to understand it not just as a mathematical concept, but in a way that connects it to the real world. I know it must be possible since this is being studied in engineering programs (which deal with real world applications) and not just theoretical mathematics.","The value of a line integral in vector calculus can be seen as ""the sum of how much the of a vector valued function affects every point of the curve"".

I should arrive at: $$ \underset{\varepsilon \rightarrow 0}{\lim} \left( G'_{x}(x, s)\bigg|_{s+\varepsilon} - G'_{x}(x, s)\bigg|_{s-\varepsilon} \right) = 1 $$ as shown, for example, here on page 6, formula 41: http://young.physics.ucsc.edu/116C/gf.pdf The second term vanished since $G(x, s)$ is continuous by definition. Indeed, it is easy to show using splitting the interval of integration into $[s-\varepsilon, s]$ and $[s, s+\varepsilon]$ and taking the limit. But what to do with $G''_{xx}(x, s)$? The formula above seems like a ""direct"" application of Newton-Leubnitz formula. Although, $G''_{xx}(x, s)$ is discontinuous and there is no such a function which could be an unambiguous antiderivative for it on the entire interval $[s - \varepsilon, s + \varepsilon]$. UPDATE: According to the theorem 3.8 by Nott (1978) ( http://www.jstor.org/stable/2100979 ), the definite integral of $G''_{xx}(x, s)$ can be computed as follows using the fact that  $G'_{x}(x, s)$ is piecewise continuous: $$ \int_a^b G''_{xx}(x, s) dx = G'_{x}(x, s)(b,s) - G'_{x}(x, s)(a,s). $$","This example is taken from the Wikipedia's article. Namely, find the Green's function for $$y'' + y = f(x)$$ with boundary conditions: $$y(0) = y(\frac {\pi} {2}) = 0.$$ The defining equation for the Green's function is: $$G''_{xx}(x, s) + G(x, s) = \delta (x-s).$$ There are some subtle aspects related to integration of discontinuous functions which I can't understand clearly.
