Since χ(G) = k, (If G1,G2,...,Gr are the components of a disconnected graph G, then χ(G) = max χ(Gi) 1≤i≤r ) then there is a component G1 of G such that  χ(G1)=k.If v is any vertex of G which is not in G1,then G1 isa component of the subgraph G − v.

Have a look at my proof, any feedback appreciated: Lemma 1 : Every planar graph contains a vertex with $\operatorname{deg}(v) \leq 5$. Theorem : Every planar graph with $n$ vertices can be colored using at most 5 colors. Proof by induction, we induct on $n$, the number of vertices in a planar graph $G$. Base case, $P(n \leq 5)$: Since there exist $\leq 5$ nodes in $G$, the graph can be colored using 5 colors. Inductive step, $P(n+1)$: Assuming $P(n)$ is true, that is, every planar graph with $n$ vertices, we need to show $P(n)$ is true. By Lemma 1, we know every planar graph has one vertex with $\operatorname{deg}(v) \leq 5$. We call this vertex $v$ in our graph $G$. Remove $v$ and for the remaining subgraph $G'$ we can assume $P(n)$. If $\operatorname{deg}(v) \leq 4$, we can color all vertices adjacent to $v$ using 4 colors and use color 5 to color $v$ itself to reach a valid coloring. If $\operatorname{deg}(v) = 5$, we assume that all vertices adjacent to $v$ are colored in different colors. Assume there exists no path from $A$ to $C$.  We can change the color of $A$ from red to blue, the color of $C$. Since no neighbor of $v$ now has the color red, we can color $v$ in red. We also need to change all vertices adjacent to $A$ from blue to red. Since no path exists from $A$ to $C$, the color of $C$ remains unchanged. Assume there exists a path from $A$ to $C$, alernating in color from red to blue. Note that this path bounds a planar embedding with $B$ on the inside and $D$ on the outside.  We can change the color of $B$ from green to yellow, the color of $D$. Since no neighbor of $v$ now has the color green, we can color $v$ in green. We also need to change all vertices adjacent to $B$ from yellow to green. Since no path can exist from $B$ to $D$ (without crossing the path from $A$ to $C$), the color of $D$ remains unchanged.","I have been studying planar graphs for a while now and found it useful for my learning to formulate a few proofs myself, based on the study material I worked through.

A gamma shape is: So to solve this I proceeded with induction. Here is my proof: For $n=1$ we have a $2 \times 2$ chessboard and if we remove square   then a gamma shape remains so we can cover this and leave exactly one uncovered. Now suppose that for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ we can cover the $2^n \times 2^n$ chessboard with gamma shapes living exactly one square out so we can cover it leaving a corner out. Now for $n+1$ we have a $(2 \times2^n) \times (2 \times 2^n)$ chessboard  which is a union of the $4$ smaller $2^n \times 2^n$ chessboards.So we can picture in mind a big chestboard of $4$ smaller. From this union we pick one of the smaller chessboards and we cover it with gamma shapes leaving  exactly one square uncovered at the corner of this chessboard which is a corner of the bigger chessboard . To cover the rest $3$ chessboards (this time all of their squares) we use the induction hypothesis.   Note that these three remaining chessboard form a big gamma shape. From these chessboards we remove(but not realy, just in our mind) the $3$ centered squares wich form a little gamma shape (in the big gamma shape that form the 3 chessboards) So each of the 3 chessboards we can cover it with gamma shapes using our induction hypothesis and to finish we add another gamma shape to to cover the 3 centered squares we removed in our mind. Thus we are done because we covered a $(2 \times2^n) \times (2 \times 2^n)$ chessboard with gamma shapes leaving only one out. My question is: Is there another more elegant and simpler solution than this or any other solution at all? I'm very curious to know.
