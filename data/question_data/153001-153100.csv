We can easily show that one cannot accomplish walking to infinity using steps of bounded length on the real line using primes in $\mathbb{R}$. For an arbitrary natural number $k$, consider the $k-1$ consecutive numbers $$ k! + 2, k! + 3, \ldots k! + k, $$ all of which are composite. This is another way of saying there are arbitrarily large gaps in the primes. For the Gaussian primes, there is computational proof that a moat of length $\sqrt{26}$ exists, so one cannot walk to infinity using steps of length $5$. Erdos is said to have conjectured that it is impossible to complete the walk. Percolation theory also suggests that the walk is impossible, though to my understanding this heuristic assumes the primes are completely independent in some way. Eisenstein integers are numbers of the form $a+b\omega$, with $a$, $b \in \mathbb{R}$, where $\omega = \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\pi/3}$. My first and main question is - What is the current lower bound for step size in the analogous problem for Eisenstein primes? Quaternions with all integer components are called Lipshitz integers. So let us call primes over this ring Lipshitz primes. A Lipshitz integer is only a Lipshitz prime if its norm is a prime. Is anything known about the moat problem over $\mathbb{H}$? One might think that given the extra dimensions or degrees of freedom walking to infinity should be easier, however I'm not sure how rare Lipshitz primes are.

3,Class group and factorizations,Class group and factorizations,,"There is a common characterization of the class group ${\rm Cl}(R)$ as a kind of measure of how badly factorization fails to be unique. The most obvious justification for this sentiment is that the order of the class group of $R$ determines if it has unique factorization or not: $$h=1\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad {\rm PID}\quad \Rightarrow \quad {\rm UFD}. \tag{$\star$}$$ This is very unsatisfying though because the exact size of $h$ (not even to mention all of the group structure that ${\rm Cl}(R)$ has in general) is not used, and ""UFD / not UFD"" doesn't in any sense measure the extent to which $R$ fails to be a UFD, only if it does. Plus, the converse, UFD $\Rightarrow$ PID, is specific to when $R$ is Dedekind, so this is only a partial justification. There are a number of answers exposing specific ideas in How does a class group measure the failure of unique factorization? (which is basically my question here, but I am resurrecting it because I am not satisfied) and Class number measuring failure of unique factorization at MO. PLC and BD cite Carlitz ($h=2$ iff factorization lengths are invariant), PLC notes that $h$ can yield arithmetic obstructions to certain paths like in FLT, and BD cites a theorem of Kaczorowski which goes from factorization information to an exact isomorphism class characterization of the class group (which is reverse of the desired order: going from class group to factorization information). Kevin has the strongest skeptical vibe among the responses in his conclusion: Unfortunately, you can see we lose a lot of information in passing to the class group, and in particular it doesn't tell us anything at all about which elements are obstacles to unique factorization. The intuition, rather, is that a more complicated class group implies we're further from unique factorization. I am not sure how the mentioned intuition translates into concrete facts, but I do get the impression that $\rm Cl$ doesn't have the right ""type"" of information to talk about factorizations. Rather, I think the more direct description for $\rm Cl$ is as a measure of how ideals fail to act like numbers. Here is my own crack at ""measuring"" factorization's failure to be unique. Let $\Gamma(R)$ be the set of all associates classes of irreducible elements. (Suppose $R$ is a factorization domain, so all elements have some factorization if not a unique one, and $K$ is $R$'s fraction field.) The group of principal fractional ideals is essentially $K^\times/R^\times$, and it is generated by irreducible elements. Thus there is a surjective map $\Bbb Z^{\oplus \Gamma(R)}\to K^\times/R^\times$, and the kernel is comprised of all relations satisfied between irreducibles under multiplication. These relations are precisely the inequivalent factorizations into irreducibles that occur in $R$. Our knowledge so far can be put into a diagram: $$\{{\rm relations}\}\to\Bbb Z^{\oplus \Gamma(R)}\to K^\times/R^\times\to I(R)\to{\rm Cl}(R).$$ Observe this has two subsequences which are short exact, the first ending and the second beginning with $K^\times/R^\times$. (Can we determine if $\rm relations$ is infinitely generated or not?) One thing to notice is that in such a sequence $A\to B\to C\to D\to E$, the exact sequence $C\to D\to E$ generically is expected to have little control over the exact sequence $A\to B\to C$, which at face value seems like good evidence that ${\rm Cl}(R)$ does not influence factorization very much, but in fact $(\star)$ says $|{\rm Cl}|=1$ implies $\{\rm relations\}=0$, so this diagram does not fully capture the situation. So, my questions: What direct , specific relationships exist between elemental factorizations and ideal classes? (In particular, beyond Kaczorowski's theorem.) Why is it useful to think of ${\rm Cl}(R)$ as measuring the failure of unique factorization, as opposed to being only indirectly related (i.e. by measuring the failure of ideals to act like numbers)? What properties of ${\rm Cl}(R)$ definitively don't say anything specific about factorizations, and conversely what properties of factorizations are definitively not captured by ideal classes?

Wroblewski has a database for the equation, $$x_1^4+x_2^4+x_3^4+x_4^4+x_5^4 = y_1^4$$  Of about $13700$ primitive solutions with $y_1 < 10000$ and $y_1\not\equiv 0{\pmod 5}$, only four examples can be found with $x_1 = 1$, namely $$1^4 + 150^4 + 3340^4 + 6130^4 + 6350^4 = 7499^4\\ 1^4 + 2520^4 + 3250^4 + 5050^4 + 6970^4 = 7499^4\tag1$$ and $$1^4 + 920^4 + 3120^4 + 5410^4 + 8870^4 = 9193^4\\ 1^4 + 1410^4 + 3490^4 + 6020^4 + 8680^4 = 9193^4\tag2$$ Surely the fact they come in pairs can't be coincidence. I think they are particular instances of a identity similar to cubes, $$\small 1^3 + (-1 - 9t^3 - 648t^6 + 3888t^9)^3 + (3t + 81t^4 - 1296t^7 +          3888t^{10})^3 = (-135t^\color{red}4 + 3888t^\color{red}{10})^3\tag3$$ Because the RHS has only $\color{red}{even}$ powers, then it is immune to sign changes. For example, let $t=-1,1$ and we get, $$1^3 -4528^3 + 5262^3 = 3753^3\\ 1^3 + 3230^3 + 2676^3 = 3753^3$$ So that explains the one for cubes. Q: What, however, explains $(1)$ and $(2)$?

Wroblewski has a database for the equation, $$x_1^4+x_2^4+x_3^4+x_4^4+x_5^4 = y_1^4$$  Of about $13700$ primitive solutions with $y_1 < 10000$ and $y_1\not\equiv 0{\pmod 5}$, only four examples can be found with $x_1 = 1$, namely $$1^4 + 150^4 + 3340^4 + 6130^4 + 6350^4 = 7499^4\\ 1^4 + 2520^4 + 3250^4 + 5050^4 + 6970^4 = 7499^4\tag1$$ and $$1^4 + 920^4 + 3120^4 + 5410^4 + 8870^4 = 9193^4\\ 1^4 + 1410^4 + 3490^4 + 6020^4 + 8680^4 = 9193^4\tag2$$ Surely the fact they come in pairs can't be coincidence. I think they are particular instances of a identity similar to cubes, $$\small 1^3 + (-1 - 9t^3 - 648t^6 + 3888t^9)^3 + (3t + 81t^4 - 1296t^7 +          3888t^{10})^3 = (-135t^\color{red}4 + 3888t^\color{red}{10})^3\tag3$$ Because the RHS has only $\color{red}{even}$ powers, then it is immune to sign changes. For example, let $t=-1,1$ and we get, $$1^3 -4528^3 + 5262^3 = 3753^3\\ 1^3 + 3230^3 + 2676^3 = 3753^3$$ So that explains the one for cubes. Q: What, however, explains $(1)$ and $(2)$?

10,Found an recursive identity (involving a continued fraction) for which some simplification is needed.,Found an recursive identity (involving a continued fraction) for which some simplification is needed.,,"This is my second question in this forum; as I previously explained it, I am a ""hobbyst"" mathematician and not a professional one; I apologize by advance if something is wrong in my question. I enjoy doing numerical computations on my leisure time, and at the end of year 2015, I was working on some personal routines related to the world of ISC . With the help of these pieces of code, I detected algorithmically several identities; one was already described here and solved (see this question regarding a continued fraction for tanh ). After having spent some time on another one a year ago, I would like to get some help for simplifying what I found. This new continued fraction is: $$ \mathcal{K}\left(k,x\right)=\operatorname*{K}_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{ \left(n+1\right)\left(\left(k-1\right)x-n\right)k}{\left(n+1\right)\left(k+1\right)} \tag{1} \label{1} $$ The previous notation is the one I use; I find it convenient and it can be found for instance in Continued Fractions with Applications by  Lorentzen & Waadeland, but I know that some people don't like it; it has to be read the following way: $$ a_0 + \operatorname*{K}_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{b_n}{a_n} = a_0 + \cfrac{b_1}{a_1 + \cfrac{b_2}{a_2 + \cfrac{b_3}{a_3 + \dotsb}}} $$ I found many partial formulas, some of them being very nice, involving hypergeometric functions or the Lerch Phi function. But of course I was rather interested by a fully general identity. I finally found something but that would need to be simplified now and this is what I am asking here. I would be very happy to finally see a nice identity for this continued fraction. Maybe such an identity could be published somewhere (if it happens to be interesting) and I would happily leave it to anyone who would have taken some time on it. Is it true that:   $$\mathcal{K}\left(k,x\right)=     \frac{\Gamma\left(x+1\right)\Gamma\big((k-1)x\big)}{\Gamma\left(kx\right)} \times\mathcal{L}\left(k,x\right)$$ where, $$\mathcal{L}\left(k,x\right)=\frac{k^{kx}}{2\left(k-1\right)^{\left(k-1\right)x-1}}+\sum_{i=0}^\infty \big( \alpha\;\mathcal{K}(k, x+i) - \beta\;\mathcal{K}(k, x+i+1) \big)$$ and, $$\alpha=\frac{\left(k-1\right)^{\left(k-1\right)i}\Gamma\left(k\left(i+x\right)\right)}{k^{ki}\,\Gamma\left(1+i+x\right)\Gamma\left(\left(k-1\right)\left(x+i\right)\right)}\\ \beta=\frac{\left(k-1\right)^{\left(k-1\right)i+k}\Gamma\left(k\left(1+i+x\right)\right)}{k^{k\left(i+1\right)}\Gamma\left(1+i+x\right)\Gamma\left(\left(k-1\right)\left(x+i\right)+k\right)}$$ Since I work with empirical computations, I have to say that this formula is rather difficult to check because convergence is rather slow, but it is a result I managed to get by gathering various other materials. In case someone would wonder whether it is worth spending some time on it or not, I can provide some partial results like nice special values: $$     \mathcal{K}\left(2, 1/2\right)\;=\;\pi/2-2     \mathrm{,}     \qquad     \mathcal{K}\left(4, 1/2\right)\;=\;4\pi\sqrt{3}/9-2     \qquad\mathrm{etc.} $$ The case $k$ being an integer When $k$ is an integer, $k\geq3$, the continued fraction follows a functional identity: $$     \mathcal{K}\left(k,x\right)\;=\; %    \displaystyle\frac{k^{kx} \Gamma{\left(x+1\right)}\Gamma{\left(\left(k-1\right)x\right)}  }{2\left(k-1\right)^{\left(k-1\right)x-1}\Gamma{\left(kx\right)}} + \mathcal{K}\left(k, x+1\right)g_k\left(x\right)     g_k\left(x\right) + \left(\displaystyle\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^k \displaystyle\frac{\Gamma{\left(\left(k-1\right)x\right)}\Gamma{\left(k\left(x+1\right)\right)}}{\Gamma{\left(\left(k-1\right)x+k\right)}\Gamma{\left(kx\right)}}\mathcal{K}\left(k, x+1\right) $$ where $g$ is a sequence of rational functions. Unfortunately I couldn't find a general form for it but I could easely compute about 30 of them with the help of numerical pieces of software. The best I could do here was to build a triangle of integer coefficients needed for building a given $g_k$ function. Let's call $m_{(a,b)}$ the coefficient in the $a^\textrm{th}$ row and $b^\textrm{th}$ column from the following triangle: $$     \begin{array}{rrrr@{\qquad}l}         -8&&&&\textrm{for $k=3$}\\         -20&2&&&\textrm{for $k=4$}\\         -40&12&-24&&\textrm{for $k=5$}\\         -70&42&-202&624&\textrm{for $k=6$}\\         \textrm{etc.}     \end{array} $$ (I can provide about 30 rows of these coefficients, see below ); then, $$             g_k\left(x\right)\;=\;\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{k-2}\displaystyle\frac{m_{(k-2,i)}x         \Gamma{\left(\left(k-1\right)x\right)}}{\left(x+1\right)k^i\Gamma{\left(\left(k-1\right)x+i\right)}} $$ A direct formula for $\mathcal{K}\left(k,x\right)$ involves the same rational function $g_k$: \begin{equation}     \begin{array}{lcl}         \mathcal{K}\left(k,x\right)&=&         \displaystyle\frac{ \Gamma{\left(x+1\right)}\Gamma{\left(\left(k-1\right)x\right)} }{ \Gamma{\left(kx\right)} }\\[24pt]         &&\times\quad\left(  \displaystyle\frac{k^{kx} }{2\left(k-1\right)^{\left(k-1\right)x-1}}         +\displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^\infty     \displaystyle\frac{ \left(k-1\right)^{\left(k-1\right)i}     \Gamma{\left(k\left(i+x\right)\right)}}{k^{ki}\Gamma{\left(1+i+x\right)}\Gamma{\left(\left(k-1\right)\left(x+i\right)\right)}}g_k\left(x+i\right) \right) \end{array} \label{directform} \end{equation} The first formula I gave in my question was found by substituting $g$ from these last expressions. Of course, finding some formula for the $m$ coefficients would be nice, but I couldn't figure out any despite the time I spent on it. It looks also like the infinite sum above can be turned into a finite sum of $k-2$ hypergeometric functions as a direct formula for $\mathcal{K}\left(k,x\right)$. The initial cases are the simplest, like for $k=3$: $$ \begin{array}{lcl}     \displaystyle\mathcal{K}\left(3,x\right)&=& \displaystyle\operatorname*{K}_{n=1}^{\infty}\displaystyle\frac{\left(n+1\right)\left(6x-3n\right)}{4n+4}\\ &=& \cfrac{12x-6}{8+\cfrac{18x-18}{12+\cfrac{24x-36}{16+\cfrac{30x-60}{20+\ddots}}}}\\ &=& \displaystyle\frac{27^x\, \Gamma\left(x+1\right)\Gamma\left(2x\right)}   {4^x\, \Gamma\left(3x\right)}   - \displaystyle\frac{4\,\displaystyle{}_3F_2\left(1,x+\frac{1}{3},x+\frac{2}{3};\;x+\frac{1}{2},x+2;\;1\right)}{ 3\left(x+1\right) } \end{array} $$ The general case being: $$     \begin{array}{lcl}         \mathcal{K}\left(k,x\right)&=&         \displaystyle\frac{k^{kx} \Gamma{\left(x+1\right)}\Gamma{\left(\left(k-1\right)x\right)}  }{2\left(k-1\right)^{\left(k-1\right)x-1}\Gamma{\left(kx\right)}}\\[24pt]         &+& \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{k-2} \displaystyle\frac{m_{(k-2,i)} x \;\;\displaystyle {}_{k+1}F_{k} \left( \begin{array}{l} 1,x+\frac{1}{k},x+\frac{2}{k},\dots,x+\frac{k-1}{k},x+1\\[4pt] x+\frac{i}{k-1},  x+\frac{i+1}{k-1},   \dots,x+\frac{i+k-2}{k-1},x+2 \end{array}   {1} \right) } {k^i\left(x+1\right) \Gamma{\left(\left(k-1\right)x+i \right)}/\Gamma{\left(\left(k-1\right)x\right)}      }   \end{array} $$ where obviously the $x+1$ term can always be cancelled (since one of the $x+(i+\dots)/(k-1)$ terms is always equal to $x+1$ leading to a ${}_{k}F_{k-1}$ function. Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out how to make some substitution between this last formula with $m$ coefficients and previous formulae above involving the $g$ function. The case $kx$ being an integer In order to study consecutive integer values of the~$kx$ product, I will now use another notation: $$     \mathcal{K}'\left(k', x'\right)\;=\;\mathcal{K}\left(x', k'/x'\right) $$ Starting from here, $k'$ is assumed to be an integer (according to the previous notation, it means that~$kx$ is an integer). New identities, involving different expressions can be found (leading to different kinds of special values when possible): $$     \begin{array}{lcl}         \mathcal{K}'\left(k',x'\right)&=&         h_{k'}\left(x'\right) -            \left(\displaystyle\frac{x'}{x'-1}\right)^{k'-1}            \displaystyle\frac            {k'\;\Phi\left(-(x'-1)^{-1}, 1, k'/x'\right)-x'+1}            {k'/x'\; \beta\left(k', -k'/x'\right)}\\[24pt]      &=& h_{k'}\left(x'\right) -            \left(\displaystyle\frac{x'}{x'-1}\right)^{k'-1}            \displaystyle\frac{            \displaystyle\int_{t=0}^1            \left(              \displaystyle\frac{\left(1-t\right)\left(x'-1\right)}{x'-1+t}      \right)^{k'/x'}\textrm{d}t}            {k'/x'\; \beta\left(k', -k'/x'\right)}\\[24pt]      &=& h_{k'}\left(x'\right) -            \left(\displaystyle\frac{x'}{x'-1}\right)^{k'-1}            \;            \displaystyle\frac            {                    \displaystyle{}_{2}F_{1}\left(1,k'/x'\;; 1+k'/x'\;; \left(1-x'\right)^{-1}\right) x'             -x' + 1   }            {k'/x'\; \beta\left(k', -k'/x'\right)}\\[24pt]     \end{array} $$ where $h$ is (again) a sequence of rational functions. Let's call $m'$ the sequence of following polynomial functions (I computed about 20 of them): $$     \begin{array}{l@{\qquad}l}         1,&\textrm{(for $k'=3$)}\\         -6 + 4x,&\textrm{(for $k'=4$)}\\         41 - 53x + 18x^2,&\textrm{(for $k'=5$)}\\         -348 + 648x - 420x^2 + 96x^3,&\textrm{(for $k'=6$)}\\         \textrm{etc.}     \end{array} $$ (I have about 20 rows like that, see below ); then, $$     \left\{\begin{array}{l@{\qquad}l}             h_1\left(x'\right)\;=\;-1&\textrm{if $k'=1$}\\[12pt]             h_2\left(x'\right)\;=\;0&\textrm{if $k'=2$}\\[12pt]             h_{k'}\left(x'\right)\;=\;     \displaystyle\frac{ m'_{k'-2} \left(k'\left(x'-1\right)-x'\right)\left(x'-1\right) }{ \left(k'-1\right)!\left(x'-1\right)^{k'-1}  } &\textrm{if $k'\geq3$} \end{array}\right. $$ Again, finding some formula for these $m'$ coefficients would lead to a beautiful formula for $\mathcal{K}$. Materials (data) Finding a formula for one of these two triangles would lead to a direct formula; I put my data below in case someone would have a glance at them. I used the Mathematica format but it is very easy to convert it to anything else. Two pieces of data are attaches: the triangle of $m$ coefficients; the triangle of $m'$ polynomials.

previously explained it, I am a ""hobbyst"" mathematician and not a professional one; I apologize by advance if something is wrong in my question. I enjoy doing numerical computations on my leisure time, and at the end of year 2015, I was working on some personal routines related to the world of ISC . With the help of these pieces of code, I detected algorithmically several identities; one was already described here and solved (see this question regarding a continued fraction for tanh ). After having spent some time on another one a year ago, I would like to get some help for simplifying what I found. This new continued fraction is: $$ \mathcal{K}\left(k,x\right)=\operatorname*{K}_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{ \left(n+1\right)\left(\left(k-1\right)x-n\right)k}{\left(n+1\right)\left(k+1\right)} \tag{1} \label{1} $$ The previous notation is the one I use; I find it convenient and it can be found for instance in Continued Fractions with Applications by  Lorentzen & Waadeland, but I know that some people don't like it; it has to be read the following way: $$ a_0 + \operatorname*{K}_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{b_n}{a_n} = a_0 + \cfrac{b_1}{a_1 + \cfrac{b_2}{a_2 + \cfrac{b_3}{a_3 + \dotsb}}} $$ I found many partial formulas, some of them being very nice, involving hypergeometric functions or the Lerch Phi function. But of course I was rather interested by a fully general identity. I finally found something but that would need to be simplified now and this is what I am asking here. I would be very happy to finally see a nice identity for this continued fraction. Maybe such an identity could be published somewhere (if it happens to be interesting) and I would happily leave it to anyone who would have taken some time on it. Is it true that:   $$\mathcal{K}\left(k,x\right)=     \frac{\Gamma\left(x+1\right)\Gamma\big((k-1)x\big)}{\Gamma\left(kx\right)} \times\mathcal{L}\left(k,x\right)$$ where, $$\mathcal{L}\left(k,x\right)=\frac{k^{kx}}{2\left(k-1\right)^{\left(k-1\right)x-1}}+\sum_{i=0}^\infty \big( \alpha\;\mathcal{K}(k, x+i) - \beta\;\mathcal{K}(k, x+i+1) \big)$$ and, $$\alpha=\frac{\left(k-1\right)^{\left(k-1\right)i}\Gamma\left(k\left(i+x\right)\right)}{k^{ki}\,\Gamma\left(1+i+x\right)\Gamma\left(\left(k-1\right)\left(x+i\right)\right)}\\ \beta=\frac{\left(k-1\right)^{\left(k-1\right)i+k}\Gamma\left(k\left(1+i+x\right)\right)}{k^{k\left(i+1\right)}\Gamma\left(1+i+x\right)\Gamma\left(\left(k-1\right)\left(x+i\right)+k\right)}$$ Since I work with empirical computations, I have to say that this formula is rather difficult to check because convergence is rather slow, but it is a result I managed to get by gathering various other materials. In case someone would wonder whether it is worth spending some time on it or not, I can provide some partial results like nice special values: $$     \mathcal{K}\left(2, 1/2\right)\;=\;\pi/2-2     \mathrm{,}     \qquad     \mathcal{K}\left(4, 1/2\right)\;=\;4\pi\sqrt{3}/9-2     \qquad\mathrm{etc.} $$ The case $k$ being an integer When $k$ is an integer, $k\geq3$, the continued fraction follows a functional identity: $$     \mathcal{K}\left(k,x\right)\;=\; %    \displaystyle\frac{k^{kx} \Gamma{\left(x+1\right)}\Gamma{\left(\left(k-1\right)x\right)}  }{2\left(k-1\right)^{\left(k-1\right)x-1}\Gamma{\left(kx\right)}} + \mathcal{K}\left(k, x+1\right)g_k\left(x\right)     g_k\left(x\right) + \left(\displaystyle\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^k \displaystyle\frac{\Gamma{\left(\left(k-1\right)x\right)}\Gamma{\left(k\left(x+1\right)\right)}}{\Gamma{\left(\left(k-1\right)x+k\right)}\Gamma{\left(kx\right)}}\mathcal{K}\left(k, x+1\right) $$ where $g$ is a sequence of rational functions. Unfortunately I couldn't find a general form for it but I could easely compute about 30 of them with the help of numerical pieces of software. The best I could do here was to build a triangle of integer coefficients needed for building a given $g_k$ function. Let's call $m_{(a,b)}$ the coefficient in the $a^\textrm{th}$ row and $b^\textrm{th}$ column from the following triangle: $$     \begin{array}{rrrr@{\qquad}l}         -8&&&&\textrm{for $k=3$}\\         -20&2&&&\textrm{for $k=4$}\\         -40&12&-24&&\textrm{for $k=5$}\\         -70&42&-202&624&\textrm{for $k=6$}\\         \textrm{etc.}     \end{array} $$ (I can provide about 30 rows of these coefficients, see below ); then, $$             g_k\left(x\right)\;=\;\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{k-2}\displaystyle\frac{m_{(k-2,i)}x         \Gamma{\left(\left(k-1\right)x\right)}}{\left(x+1\right)k^i\Gamma{\left(\left(k-1\right)x+i\right)}} $$ A direct formula for $\mathcal{K}\left(k,x\right)$ involves the same rational function $g_k$: \begin{equation}     \begin{array}{lcl}         \mathcal{K}\left(k,x\right)&=&         \displaystyle\frac{ \Gamma{\left(x+1\right)}\Gamma{\left(\left(k-1\right)x\right)} }{ \Gamma{\left(kx\right)} }\\[24pt]         &&\times\quad\left(  \displaystyle\frac{k^{kx} }{2\left(k-1\right)^{\left(k-1\right)x-1}}         +\displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^\infty     \displaystyle\frac{ \left(k-1\right)^{\left(k-1\right)i}     \Gamma{\left(k\left(i+x\right)\right)}}{k^{ki}\Gamma{\left(1+i+x\right)}\Gamma{\left(\left(k-1\right)\left(x+i\right)\right)}}g_k\left(x+i\right) \right) \end{array} \label{directform} \end{equation} The first formula I gave in my question was found by substituting $g$ from these last expressions. Of course, finding some formula for the $m$ coefficients would be nice, but I couldn't figure out any despite the time I spent on it. It looks also like the infinite sum above can be turned into a finite sum of $k-2$ hypergeometric functions as a direct formula for $\mathcal{K}\left(k,x\right)$. The initial cases are the simplest, like for $k=3$: $$ \begin{array}{lcl}     \displaystyle\mathcal{K}\left(3,x\right)&=& \displaystyle\operatorname*{K}_{n=1}^{\infty}\displaystyle\frac{\left(n+1\right)\left(6x-3n\right)}{4n+4}\\ &=& \cfrac{12x-6}{8+\cfrac{18x-18}{12+\cfrac{24x-36}{16+\cfrac{30x-60}{20+\ddots}}}}\\ &=& \displaystyle\frac{27^x\, \Gamma\left(x+1\right)\Gamma\left(2x\right)}   {4^x\, \Gamma\left(3x\right)}   - \displaystyle\frac{4\,\displaystyle{}_3F_2\left(1,x+\frac{1}{3},x+\frac{2}{3};\;x+\frac{1}{2},x+2;\;1\right)}{ 3\left(x+1\right) } \end{array} $$ The general case being: $$     \begin{array}{lcl}         \mathcal{K}\left(k,x\right)&=&         \displaystyle\frac{k^{kx} \Gamma{\left(x+1\right)}\Gamma{\left(\left(k-1\right)x\right)}  }{2\left(k-1\right)^{\left(k-1\right)x-1}\Gamma{\left(kx\right)}}\\[24pt]         &+& \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{k-2} \displaystyle\frac{m_{(k-2,i)} x \;\;\displaystyle {}_{k+1}F_{k} \left( \begin{array}{l} 1,x+\frac{1}{k},x+\frac{2}{k},\dots,x+\frac{k-1}{k},x+1\\[4pt] x+\frac{i}{k-1},  x+\frac{i+1}{k-1},   \dots,x+\frac{i+k-2}{k-1},x+2 \end{array}   {1} \right) } {k^i\left(x+1\right) \Gamma{\left(\left(k-1\right)x+i \right)}/\Gamma{\left(\left(k-1\right)x\right)}      }   \end{array} $$ where obviously the $x+1$ term can always be cancelled (since one of the $x+(i+\dots)/(k-1)$ terms is always equal to $x+1$ leading to a ${}_{k}F_{k-1}$ function. Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out how to make some substitution between this last formula with $m$ coefficients and previous formulae above involving the $g$ function. The case $kx$ being an integer In order to study consecutive integer values of the~$kx$ product, I will now use another notation: $$     \mathcal{K}'\left(k', x'\right)\;=\;\mathcal{K}\left(x', k'/x'\right) $$ Starting from here, $k'$ is assumed to be an integer (according to the previous notation, it means that~$kx$ is an integer). New identities, involving different expressions can be found (leading to different kinds of special values when possible): $$     \begin{array}{lcl}         \mathcal{K}'\left(k',x'\right)&=&         h_{k'}\left(x'\right) -            \left(\displaystyle\frac{x'}{x'-1}\right)^{k'-1}            \displaystyle\frac            {k'\;\Phi\left(-(x'-1)^{-1}, 1, k'/x'\right)-x'+1}            {k'/x'\; \beta\left(k', -k'/x'\right)}\\[24pt]      &=& h_{k'}\left(x'\right) -            \left(\displaystyle\frac{x'}{x'-1}\right)^{k'-1}            \displaystyle\frac{            \displaystyle\int_{t=0}^1            \left(              \displaystyle\frac{\left(1-t\right)\left(x'-1\right)}{x'-1+t}      \right)^{k'/x'}\textrm{d}t}            {k'/x'\; \beta\left(k', -k'/x'\right)}\\[24pt]      &=& h_{k'}\left(x'\right) -            \left(\displaystyle\frac{x'}{x'-1}\right)^{k'-1}            \;            \displaystyle\frac            {                    \displaystyle{}_{2}F_{1}\left(1,k'/x'\;; 1+k'/x'\;; \left(1-x'\right)^{-1}\right) x'             -x' + 1   }            {k'/x'\; \beta\left(k', -k'/x'\right)}\\[24pt]     \end{array} $$ where $h$ is (again) a sequence of rational functions. Let's call $m'$ the sequence of following polynomial functions (I computed about 20 of them): $$     \begin{array}{l@{\qquad}l}         1,&\textrm{(for $k'=3$)}\\         -6 + 4x,&\textrm{(for $k'=4$)}\\         41 - 53x + 18x^2,&\textrm{(for $k'=5$)}\\         -348 + 648x - 420x^2 + 96x^3,&\textrm{(for $k'=6$)}\\         \textrm{etc.}     \end{array} $$ (I have about 20 rows like that, see below ); then, $$     \left\{\begin{array}{l@{\qquad}l}             h_1\left(x'\right)\;=\;-1&\textrm{if $k'=1$}\\[12pt]             h_2\left(x'\right)\;=\;0&\textrm{if $k'=2$}\\[12pt]             h_{k'}\left(x'\right)\;=\;     \displaystyle\frac{ m'_{k'-2} \left(k'\left(x'-1\right)-x'\right)\left(x'-1\right) }{ \left(k'-1\right)!\left(x'-1\right)^{k'-1}  } &\textrm{if $k'\geq3$} \end{array}\right. $$ Again, finding some formula for these $m'$ coefficients would lead to a beautiful formula for $\mathcal{K}$. Materials (data) Finding a formula for one of these two triangles would lead to a direct formula; I put my data below in case someone would have a glance at them. I used the Mathematica format but it is very easy to convert it to anything else. Two pieces of data are attaches: the triangle of $m$ coefficients; the triangle of $m'$ polynomials. First, the triangle of $m$ coefficients: m = {     {-8},     {-20,2},     {-40,12,-24},     {-70,42,-202,624},     {-112,112,-944,6800,-28160},     {-168,252,-3240,39990,-378180,1956240},

14,How many primes do I need to check to confirm that an integer $L$ is prime?,How many primes do I need to check to confirm that an integer  is prime?,L,"I recently saw the 1998 horror movie ""Cube"", in which a character claims it is humanly impossible to determine, by hand without a computer, if large (in the movie 3-digit) integers are prime powers, i.e. they are divisible by exactly one prime number. Naturally I decided to try working this problem by hand on paper. Firstly, In order to determine if a number is a prime power, I only needed to find one prime factor. For example, $5$ is a prime factor of $555$ (because $555 = 5*111$), but the other factor ($111$), is not divisible by five, so therefore $555$ has more prime factors than just $5$, and $555$ is not a prime power. I was initially just checking all the prime numbers less than the integer $L$, in order, to see if they were factors of $L$. For 3-digit numbers this usually doesn't take that long, but if $L$ itself is a prime, then you'll end up checking every prime less than $L$. So, the question becomes: Given an arbitrary integer $L$, if you perform a brute force search, checking every prime number from a list, what is the minimum number of primes you would need to check before you could stop and conclude that $L$ is prime? I decided to try to narrow down the search space. If I have a prime number $P$, where $\frac{L}{2}<P<L$, then that prime number could not possibly be a factor of $L$, because $2P>\frac{2L}{2}$, or, $2P > L$. Similarly if $\frac{L}{3}<P<L$, then, once again, $P$ could not possibly be a factor of $L$, because $3P > L$, and I've already checked that $2$ is not a factor of $L$, so $2P ≠ L$. You could make this same argument for $\frac{L}{5}, \frac{L}{7}, \frac{L}{11}$, etc. In other words, I don't need to check every prime number, I just need to check every prime number up to the point where $\frac{L}{P_{n}} < P_{n}$, ($P_{n}$ is the nth prime number) because, at that point, all primes before $P_{n}$ have been ruled out, and since $P_{n} > \frac{L}{P_{n}}$ then $(P_{n})^2 > L$, thus $P_{n}$ is not a factor of $L$. Also, if $P_{n} > \frac{L}{P_{n}}$ then $P_{n + 1} > \frac{L}{P_{n + 1}}$, because $P_{n + 1} > P_{n}$, this same reasoning rules out all larger primes. So, for example, when trying to find a prime factor of $607$, rather than checking every prime number less than $607$, I only need to check the first $10$ primes up to $29$, because $\frac{607}{29} < 29$. If the first $10$ primes are not factors of $607$, then $607$ has no prime factors and must be prime. Is my reasoning valid, and, is it possible to reduce the number of primes you'd need to check even more?","I recently saw the 1998 horror movie ""Cube"", in which a character claims it is humanly impossible to determine, by hand without a computer, if large (in the movie 3-digit) integers are prime powers, i.e. they are divisible by exactly one prime number.

We have $a = k_1 d$ and $b = k_2 d$ , so by substituting we obtain $a = k_1 (qe + c)$ and $b = k_2 (qe + c)$ . Since $e$ divides both $a$ and $b$ , it must divide both $k_1 c$ and $k_2 c$ as well.

36,What is a Shimura variety and why should I care about them?,What is a Shimura variety and why should I care about them?,,"Shimura varieties have come up tangentially in talks with some of my advisors. My vague understanding is that they are ""things that behave like moduli spaces of abelian varieties having some additional structure"". I am familiar with the modular curves $X(\Gamma)$ for $\Gamma$ a congruence subgroup of $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ , and I know they are examples of Shimura varieties. In particular $X_0(N)$ is the moduli space of elliptic curves equipped with a cyclic $N$ -isogeny, etc. I have tried to understand the Wikipedia definition of a Shimura variety, but it is pretty unintelligible to me. However, I can identify some features that are analogous to the modular curves situation, for example Wikipedia's construction involves a double coset space, similarly to constructing $X(\Gamma)$ . (That said, the definition uses a lot of Lie theory and algebraic group theory, topics I am less familiar with than number theory or algebraic geometry.) Perhaps someone could explain why Shimura varieties are important to number theory and how they fit in to problems we care about. I would really appreciate if someone could explain how the relationship between modular curves and their algebraic geometry, modular forms, and elliptic curves generalizes. Another vague intuition I have is that the modular curves are very ""special"", in that they have a complex-analytic-geometry interpretation too. You get this very nice, concrete realization and I would be very surprised if something similar happened if you looked at the moduli space of elliptic curves with $N$ -cyclic isogeny over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ , for example. How does this idea carry over when thinking about Shimura varieties? Is there a modularity theorem for Shimura varieties? Thanks so much!","Shimura varieties have come up tangentially in talks with some of my advisors. My vague understanding is that they are ""things that behave like moduli spaces of abelian varieties having some additional structure"". I am familiar with the modular curves for a congruence subgroup of , and I know they are examples of Shimura varieties. In particular is the moduli space of elliptic curves equipped with a cyclic -isogeny, etc. I have tried to understand the Wikipedia definition of a Shimura variety, but it is pretty unintelligible to me. However, I can identify some features that are analogous to the modular curves situation, for example Wikipedia's construction involves a double coset space, similarly to constructing . (That said, the definition uses a lot of Lie theory and algebraic group theory, topics I am less familiar with than number theory or algebraic geometry.) Perhaps someone could explain why Shimura varieties are important to number theory and how they fit in to problems we care about. I would really appreciate if someone could explain how the relationship between modular curves and their algebraic geometry, modular forms, and elliptic curves generalizes. Another vague intuition I have is that the modular curves are very ""special"", in that they have a complex-analytic-geometry interpretation too.

Also posted on mathoverflow . Any integer $x \ge 2$ can be written as a product of (not necessarily distinct) elements of the set $A = \{\frac21, \frac32, \frac43, \frac54, \ldots\}$ , as can be seen from a simple telescoping argument. Let $f(x)$ be the minimum number of elements of $A$ required. For example, $f(11)=5$ because $11 = \frac{33}{32} \cdot \frac{4}{3}  \cdot \frac{2}{1} \cdot \frac{2}{1} \cdot \frac{2}{1}$ (or, alternatively, $11 = \frac{11}{10} \cdot \frac{5}{4} \cdot \frac21 \cdot \frac21 \cdot \frac21$ ), but $11$ cannot be written as the product of $4$ or less elements of $A$ . In general, it seems difficult to compute $f(x)$ directly. Clearly we have $f(xy) \le f(x) + f(y)$ for any $x,y \ge 2$ . The EGMO question asks to show that this inequality is strict infinitely often (an example is $x=5$ , $y=13$ ). Here we ask: For integral $x \ge 2$ , let $f(x)$ be the smallest $k$ so that $x$ can be written as product of $k$ elements of $\{\frac21, \frac32, \frac43, \ldots\}$ . Is it true that $f(xy) =f(x) + f(y) - O(1)$ ? In other words, is the difference between $f(x)+f(y)$ and $f(xy)$ bounded? Some observations: $f(x) \ge \log_2(x)$ as $A$ has no elements larger than $2$ ; if it were true that $f(x) = \log_2(x) + O(1)$ , this would imply that the question above has a positive answer.","This question is inspired by question 2 of the 2018 European Girls' Mathematical Olympiad .

Letting $k=10n+1$ ($n$ is a natural number), let's consider in mod $5$. Let $a_l=l^k$ (mod $5$) ($l$ is an integer).

Proof : Let's consider when $k=p-1$ ($p$ is a prime number which is more than or equal to $5$). We are going to consider in mod $p$. By Fermat's little theorem, note that  $$a^{p-1}\equiv 0 (a\equiv0), 1(a\not\equiv 0).$$ Suppose that there exists an integer $x$ which satisfies $(\star)$. (i) The $x\not\equiv1$ case (the multiples of $p$ exists in the integers from $x$ to $x+p-2$): we get  $$0+1\times (p-2)\equiv 1.$$ However, this doesn't happen because $p\ge5$. (ii) The $x\equiv1$ case (there is no multiples of $p$ in the integers from $x$ to $x+p-2$): we get  $$1\times (p-1)\equiv 0.$$ However, this doesn't happen. Hence, the proof is completed.

(i) The $n=1,3,5,\cdots$ cases :  $$a_{5m}\equiv 0, a_{5m+1}\equiv 1, a_{5m+2}\equiv 3, a_{5m+3}\equiv 2, a_{5m+4}\equiv 4.$$ (ii) The $n=2,4,6,\cdots$ cases : $$a_{5m}\equiv 0, a_{5m+1}\equiv 1, a_{5m+2}\equiv 2, a_{5m+3}\equiv 3, a_{5m+4}\equiv 4.$$ Suppose that there exists an integer $x$ which satisfies $(\star)$. Letting $l=x+k-1$, we get $$(0+1+2+3+4)\times 2n+a_l \equiv a_{l+1}\ \Rightarrow\ a_l\equiv a_{l+1}.$$ in both (i) and (ii). However, this doesn't happen because of the above. Hence, the proof is completed. 3. Suppose that $k+1$ is a prime number. If there exists an integer $x$ which satisfies $(\star)$, then $k=2$. Proof : Let's consider when $k=p-1$ ($p$ is a prime number which is more than or equal to $5$). We are going to consider in mod $p$. By Fermat's little theorem, note that  $$a^{p-1}\equiv 0 (a\equiv0), 1(a\not\equiv 0).$$ Suppose that there exists an integer $x$ which satisfies $(\star)$. (i) The $x\not\equiv1$ case (the multiples of $p$ exists in the integers from $x$ to $x+p-2$): we get  $$0+1\times (p-2)\equiv 1.$$ However, this doesn't happen because $p\ge5$. (ii) The $x\equiv1$ case (there is no multiples of $p$ in the integers from $x$ to $x+p-2$): we get  $$1\times (p-1)\equiv 0.$$ However, this doesn't happen. Hence, the proof is completed.

Question: Is there one standard definition of what it means for $V$ to be ordinary, and if so, what is it? The reason I ask is that I have seen a few different definitions that don't seem to quite coincide (and perhaps this is just the state of things). For example, in Ralph Greenberg's Iwasawa Theory for $p$-adic Representations , he requires there to be a filtration $$\cdots \subseteq F^{i+1}V\subseteq F^iV\subseteq\cdots$$ of $V$ by $G_L$-stable subspaces satisfying the following conditions: (i) $F^iV=0$ for $i \gg 0$ (ii) $F^iV=V$ for $i \ll 0$ (iii) the inertia group of $G_K$ acts by $\chi_p^i$ on $F^iV/F^{i+1}V$, where $\chi_p^i$ is the $p$-adic cyclotomic character I guess it is implicit in (iii) that any jump in the filtration gives a $1$-dimensional quotient. Greenberg proves in this paper (at least for $L=\mathbf{Q}_p$) that such a representation is Hodge-Tate, but in his proof, it seems that he is not requiring $F^iV/F^{i+1}V$ to be $\leq 1$ dimensional, because he calls this dimension $h_i$ and proves that this quotient, when tensored up to $\mathbf{C}_p$ (completion of $\bar{\mathbf{Q}}_p$) is isomorphic to $\mathbf{C}_p(i)^{h_i}$ (at least I think this is what he does). This definition seems to me (unless I'm missing something which is entirely possible) to differ slightly from the one given in Tom Weston's Iwasawa Invariants of Galois Deformations (where he takes $L$ to be a finite extension of $\mathbf{Q}_p$). He calls $V$ nearly ordinary if there is a composition series $$0=V^0\subsetneq V^1\subsetneq\cdots\subseteq V^n=V$$ of the $\mathbf{Q}_p[G_L]$-module. He says that if $V$ is Hodge-Tate, then for each $i$, there is an open subgroup of inertia and an integer $m_i$ such that the open subgroup acts on $V^i/V^{i-1}$ by $\chi_p^{m_i}$. He then calls $V$ ordinary if $m_1\geq m_2\geq\cdots\geq m_n$. It seems to me that if the Hodge-Tate weights (the $m_i$) are distinct, and I can take the open subgroup for each $i$ to be the entire inertia group, then Weston's definition of ordinary implies Greenberg's, but if there are the $m_i$ are not all distinct, then it doesn't seem to work. Does Greenberg's definition force the Hodge-Tate weights to all appear with multiplicity one? Finally, I'm pretty certain I've seen a $2$-dimensional $V$ (at least when $V$ is attached to a $p$-ordinary modular form) called ordinary if it has a $1$-dimensional unramified $G_L$-quotient (if I'm not mistaken Greenberg's definition, in the $2$-dimensional case, reduces to the existence of one-dimensional $G_L$-quotient that is a Tate twist of an unramified character). This use of the term ""ordinary"" makes sense to me because it is satisfied by the $p$-adic representation attached to an elliptic curve over $L$ with good, ordinary reduction (and perhaps this is the origin of the term).

Statement of the Problem When $p$ is an odd prime, is $(p+2)/p$ an outlaw or an index? Preliminary Results The following lemmas are easy to show: Lemma 1 . If $p$ is an odd prime, and $(p+2)/p$ is the abundancy index of some integer $n$ , then $n$ is deficient. Lemma 2 . If $p$ is odd, then $\gcd(p,p+2)=1$ . Lemma 3 . If $p$ is an odd prime and $I(n) = (p+2)/p$ , then $D(n) = 2n - \sigma(n) \neq 1$ . Lemma 4 . If $p$ is an odd prime and $I(n) = (p+2)/p$ , then $p < n$ . Lemma 5 . If $p$ is an odd prime and $I(n) = (p+2)/p$ , then $\gcd(n,\sigma(n)) \neq 1$ . Remarks In fact, one can show that, if $p$ is an odd prime and $I(n) = (p+2)/p$ , then $$\sigma(n) = \bigg(\dfrac{n}{p}\bigg)\cdot(p+2)$$ and $$n = \bigg(\dfrac{\sigma(n)}{p+2}\bigg)\cdot(p).$$ (Note that $n/p$ and $\sigma(n)/(p+2)$ are (equal) integers because of Lemma 2.) Consequently, we obtain $$\gcd(n,\sigma(n)) = \dfrac{n}{p} = \dfrac{\sigma(n)}{p+2}.$$ (Note further that both $\gcd(n,\sigma(n)) \leq n/3$ and $\gcd(n,\sigma(n)) \leq \sigma(n)/5$ hold.) Added September 16 2017 Given that $X = A/B = C/D$ ( $B \neq 0$ , $D \neq 0$ , and $B \neq D$ ), we can make use of the algebraic identity $$\frac{A}{B}=\frac{C}{D}=\frac{C-A}{D-B}$$ to get another expression for $$\gcd(n,\sigma(n)) = \dfrac{n}{p} = \dfrac{\sigma(n)}{p+2}.$$ Indeed, $$\gcd(n,\sigma(n)) = \dfrac{n}{p} = \dfrac{\sigma(n)}{p+2} = \frac{\sigma(n) - n}{2}.$$ This last finding implies that $$\bigg(\frac{\sigma(n) - n}{2}\bigg) \mid n \iff (\sigma(n) - n) \mid (2n) \iff 2n = (\sigma(n) - n){d_1}$$ and $$\bigg(\frac{\sigma(n) - n}{2}\bigg) \mid \sigma(n) \iff (\sigma(n) - n) \mid (2\sigma(n)) \iff 2\sigma(n) = (\sigma(n) - n){d_2}.$$ Note that $2 \mid (\sigma(n) - n)$ .  Additionally, notice that $$2\gcd\left(n,\sigma(n)\right) = \gcd\left(2n, 2\sigma(n)\right) = \gcd\left((\sigma(n) - n){d_1},(\sigma(n) - n){d_2}\right)$$ $$= \left(\sigma(n) - n\right)\gcd({d_1},{d_2}) \iff \frac{2\gcd\left(n,\sigma(n)\right)}{\left(\sigma(n) - n\right)}=1=\gcd({d_1},{d_2}).$$ In fact, $$d_1 = \frac{2n}{\sigma(n) - n} = p$$ and $$d_2 = \frac{2\sigma(n)}{\sigma(n) - n} = p+2.$$ Double-checking if it is indeed the case that ${d_1}+2={d_2}$ : $$d_1 = \frac{2n}{\sigma(n) - n} + 2 = \frac{2n + 2(\sigma(n) - n)}{\sigma(n) - n} = \frac{2\sigma(n)}{\sigma(n) - n} = d_2.$$ So far so good! More is actually true.  One can also show that $$p(2n - \sigma(n)) = (p - 2)n$$ so that $$D(n) = (p - 2)\cdot\bigg(\dfrac{n}{p}\bigg) = (p - 2)\cdot\bigg(\dfrac{\sigma(n)}{p + 2}\bigg) = (p - 2)\cdot\gcd(n,\sigma(n)).$$ We therefore conclude that $$\dfrac{D(n)}{n} = \dfrac{p - 2}{p} = \bigg(\dfrac{p - 2}{p + 2}\bigg)\cdot{I(n)}.$$ Added October 8 2017 We deduce that $$\dfrac{p-2}{p}=\dfrac{D(n)}{n}<\dfrac{\phi(n)}{n}<\dfrac{n}{\sigma(n)}=\dfrac{p}{p+2},$$ whence there is still no contradiction.

83,Quadratic sieve algorithm,Quadratic sieve algorithm,,"I am stuck with the sieving stage of Quadratic Sieve algorithm. I've read lots of papers to this point but I can't find any guidlines how to choose sieving interval or how sieving is actually done because what I've seen so far is 'we pick a sieving interval' or 'then sieve around this'. This is what I've understood and have done (following Contini's paper): Say, for N = 90283, I compute bound $B = e^{(\frac{1}{2} + o(1))(\sqrt{\ln n \ln \ln n})} = 44$, where I take $o(1) = 0.22$ (just a random guess, I assume). What is the best way to pick good $o(1)$? Then I take $C = \lceil \sqrt{N}\rceil = 301$ Then using Atkin Sieve I get a list of primes $<B$: $\{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43\}$ Then by computing Jabobi (Legendre) symbol for each value in the primes list I pick the first quadratic nonresidues to get factor base: $\{2, 3, 7, 17, 23, 29, 37, 41\}$ Then using Tonelli-Shanks algorithm I compute modular roots $\pm t$, where $t$ is a solution to $t^2 \equiv N \mod{p}$ with $p$ a prime from factor base. Then I get two arrays of solutions $sol1 = t - C \mod p$ and $sol2 = - t - C \mod p$, with p's from factor base. and also get one arrays of logarithms for p's $l_p = \ln p$ rounded up to some precision, say two decimal digits. What is a good precision? sol1 $= \{0, 0, 2, 13, 11, 26, 10, 28\}  $ sol2 $= \{0, 1, 5, 14, 8, 10, 17, 26\}  $ $l_p$ $= \{0.69, 1.1, 1.95, 2.83, 3.14, 3.37, 3.61, 3.71\}$ Now as far as I understand I have to initialize 'sieving_array' initialized to 0's, say, to size $ = 60$ elements. Also, how should I choose size of the sieving interval? Is there any formula similar to the bound? Then I have to add values from $l_p$ to sieving array to positions $sol1[j] + i * $factor_base[j] and $sol1[j] + i *$ factor_base[j], where $ 0 \le i \le $ size and $ 0 \le j \le |$factor_base$|$.

Therefore I am posting my solution and I ask for other ways to prove this theorem too. The Question Prove that there cannot be an infinite integer arithmetic progression of distinct terms all of which are perfect squares. My attempt We shall prove it using contradiction. First off, there are a couple of things to notice which greatly simplify our discussion: The AP cannot be decreasing as eventually, the terms will be negative and perfect squares are non-negative. There has to be a non-zero, positive difference between the terms otherwise the terms would not be distinct. Let us therefore, assume an AP with the first term $a$ - a non-negative integer and the positive difference $d$. The $i$th term of the AP is $T_i=a+(i-1)d$. The AP is increasing, therefore there is a term $T_n$ for the least value of $n$ such that $T_n\geq d^2$. Now, $T_{n+1}$ is also a perfect square. Let $T_{n+1}=b^2$. Therefore, we have $$ d^2 \leq b^2 \implies d \leq b  $$ Therefore we have  $$ T_{n+1}=b^2+d<b^2+2b+1=(b+1)^2 $$ or $$b^2 < T_{n+1} < (b+1)^2$$ However, there are no perfect squares between two consecutive perfect squares.
