39,Is the greatest common divisor injective? Is it bijective?,Is the greatest common divisor injective? Is it bijective?,,"In an examination paper, there were the following questions: Is gcd an injective function? Is gcd a bijective function? I found these questions odd because I thought that we need to first know the domain and codomain of a function before we can decide whether it is injective or bijective. The question did not specify what was the domain and codomain. Since every integer divides 0 (except 0 itself), then gcd(0, 0) would be undefined as there is no ""greatest"" integer that divides 0 and 0. Hence, it seems reasonable to exclude 0 from the domain. Also, since 0 does not divide any number, it is impossible for 0 to be the gcd of any two integers a and b, so 0 should be excluded from the codomain. Now, suppose we let both the domain and codomain be the set of all positive natural numbers. Would this domain be valid? I am confused because the gcd function contains two arguments, i.e. a and b in gcd(a, b). Since this is the case, should the domain instead be the cartesian product N*N? Clearly gcd is a function because it is not one-to-many. Every time we perform gcd we get exactly one output. Is it correct to claim that gcd is not an injective function because it maps two natural numbers a and b to a single output c, i.e. gcd(a, b) = c, hence it is many-to-one? Or should the correct reason be that gcd is not injective because more than one pair of numbers can have the same gcd, hence there is no strict one-one correspondence between the domain and the codomain? For example, gcd(2, 4) = 2 and gcd(2, 8) = 2. Also, is it correct to claim that gcd is a surjective function because every element in the codomain is the gcd of a pair of positive natural numbers, i.e. every element in the codomain is mapped to by at least one element in the domain? I came to this conclusion because every positive natural number k can be expressed as k = gcd(k, k). Please correct me if I am wrong!","In an examination paper, there were the following questions: Is gcd an injective function? Is gcd a bijective function?

40,Are $C^{\infty}$ completely defined by their derivatives?,Are  completely defined by their derivatives?,C^{\infty},"This question has been on my mind for some time. Here's my process. Firstly, is it possible to construct a function such that it's defined with a different expression on different intervals, but that it's still in $C^{\infty}$? For example, say we define a function like this: $f(x)=\cos x$ for $x\ge0$ $f(x)=1 + \sin (x)$ for $x\le0$ The function is continuous. It's first derivative is $f'(x)=-\sin x$ for $x\ge0$ $f'(x)=\cos x$ for $x\le0$ Not continuous. If I chose two functions and match their values AND first derivatives, they differ in the third derivative. If I match that one also, the differ in the fourth... well, you get the point. So I was thinking, could it be that a function in $C^{\infty}$ is fully defined by all it's derivatives in a single point?  If I want to make a polynomial that aproximates the $\sin$ function, I can make it of an arbitrarily high degree and match as many derivatives as I want. Say I have a sequence of functions $g_n$, such that $g_n^{(i)}(x_0)=\sin^{(i)}(x_0)$ for every $i\in\{0,...,n\}$. Is $\lim_n g_n=\sin$? If not for every $g_n$, is it true if we restrict $g_n$s to polynomials of $n$th degree?","This question has been on my mind for some time. Here's my process.

Given this information, is there a way to rapidly derive the formula for this parabolic curve?  My issue is that I need to generate this equation directly in computer software, but all the standard-formula definitions for a parabolic curve use its Vertex, not its intercepts.  Is there some standard form of equation into which these intercepts can be 'plugged in' in order to produce a working relation?  If not, what is the most computationally direct way to solve this problem?","I have a pair of points at my disposal.

My (maybe wrong) solution : Start listing down some values of $f(x)$ with $f(2) = -f(0)$ and $f(3) = f(0) + a$ . $f(2) + f(3) = - f(0) + f(0) + a = a$ . Similarly, you can write $f(1) = -(f(-1))$ and $f(2) = f(-1) + a$ . Hence, $f(1) + f(2) = -(f(-1)) + f(-1) + a = a$ . So, $f(1) + f(2) = f(2) + f(3) \Longrightarrow f(1) = f(3).$ But, according to the problem, $f(x + 2) = -f(x) \Longrightarrow f(3) = -f(1)$ .
