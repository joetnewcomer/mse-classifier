But I could sure use help. It's distressing to me that I'm trying to get better at math but I don't even understand a fundamental concept like functions... please explain very pedantically because I am a little slow. Statement in question Let's say: $\forall x,y \quad f(x) = g(x+y)$ My questions Is it correct to say that $g(x+y)$ is a function of one variable or two variables? My attempt: It's clear to me that $g(x)$ is a function of one variable and $g(x,y)$ is a function of two variables. But I'm not sure about $g(x+y)$. I would guess $g$ is a function of a function and the inner function can be thought of as ""one variable"" that has ""two variables."" That seems really convoluted... What are some trivial examples of the statement above? My attempts: My trivial example A: $f(x)=C$ and $g(x+y) = x+y$ My trivial example B: $f(x)=C$ and $g(x+y) = (x+y)^{30} + y^{x} - x$ My trivial example C: $f(x) = 42$ and $g(x+y) = 42$ My trivial example D: $f(x) = 11$ and $g(x+y) = 5u - u$ Are those acceptable trivial examples? In my last example I switched it up to $u$ on purpose... kind of shooting in the dark. Can you give me some trivial examples if mine are wrong? Is it true that $\forall x,y \quad$ if $f(x) = g(x,y)$ then the LHS must be a constant? I know how to prove it if it's $g(x+y)$ but not for $g(x,y)$. If this is not true can you give me a trivial counter example? Let's say that $h(x,y)$ is a function of distance. Then you can say $h(x,y) = k(x^{2}+y^{2})$. You don't have to put the square root part of the distance function into $k$ because that can be part of the function $k()$ itself. But I don't think you can ""simplify"" it further from $x^{2}+y^{2}$. Correct? It's interesting to me that $k((x^{2}+y^{2})^{50})$ can be called a ""function based on distance"" even though it is powered to the 50 and the distance formula is powered to 0.5... Thank you for your help and patience!","Background First I apologize because the following are very elementary and annoying questions about functions. But I could sure use help. It's distressing to me that I'm trying to get better at math but I don't even understand a fundamental concept like functions... please explain very pedantically because I am a little slow. Statement in question Let's say: $\forall x,y \quad f(x) = g(x+y)$ My questions Is it correct to say that $g(x+y)$ is a function of one variable or two variables? My attempt: It's clear to me that $g(x)$ is a function of one variable and $g(x,y)$ is a function of two variables. But I'm not sure about $g(x+y)$. I would guess $g$ is a function of a function and the inner function can be thought of as ""one variable"" that has ""two variables."" That seems really convoluted... What are some trivial examples of the statement above? My attempts: My trivial example A: $f(x)=C$ and $g(x+y) = x+y$ My trivial example B: $f(x)=C$ and $g(x+y) = (x+y)^{30} + y^{x} - x$ My trivial example C: $f(x) = 42$ and $g(x+y) = 42$ My trivial example D: $f(x) = 11$ and $g(x+y) = 5u - u$ Are those acceptable trivial examples? In my last example I switched it up to $u$ on purpose... kind of shooting in the dark. Can you give me some trivial examples if mine are wrong? Is it true that $\forall x,y \quad$ if $f(x) = g(x,y)$ then the LHS must be a constant? I know how to prove it if it's $g(x+y)$ but not for $g(x,y)$. If this is not true can you give me a trivial counter example? Let's say that $h(x,y)$ is a function of distance. Then you can say $h(x,y) = k(x^{2}+y^{2})$. You don't have to put the square root part of the distance function into $k$ because that can be part of the function $k()$ itself. But I don't think you can ""simplify"" it further from $x^{2}+y^{2}$. Correct? It's interesting to me that $k((x^{2}+y^{2})^{50})$ can be called a ""function based on distance"" even though it is powered to the 50 and the distance formula is powered to 0.5...

Let $f(x) = \dfrac{1-x}{1+x}$. $f \circ f(x) = x, \quad$ But the domain is not $\mathbb{R}$ because $f(x)$ is undefined for $x = -1$. This made sense to me after some thinking, $f \circ f(x)$ is only equivalent to $x$ if $x \neq -1$, so really one needs to specify the domain. So far so good, but then I started questioning the way I usually simplify algebraic expressions and solve equations. If I were to solve the equation $p_1(x) = q_1(x)$ I might start simplifying both expressions and come up with a simpler equation: $p_1(x) = q_1(x) \iff p_2(x) = q_2(x) \iff ... \iff p_n(x) = q_n(x)$ and here any $q_k(x)\iff q_t(x)\quad$ right? So I tried to come up with cases when I felt I probably would not bother with specifying domains before simplifying an expression, but probably would if the expression was used in an equation, as an example: $\dfrac{1}{x} + x - \dfrac{1}{x} = 0$ So usually I feel like I have always just regarded the left hand side as equivalent to $x$, if just asked to simplify the left hand side as an expression. But the equation makes me confused. Obviously $\dfrac{1}{x}$ is not defined when $x = 0$, but then again $\dfrac{1}{x}$ and $-\dfrac{1}{x}$ cancel eachother out, so does it really matter that they are not defined when $x = 0$? I tried to consult wolframalpha, but if I plug in $x = x + \dfrac{1}{x} - \dfrac{1}{x}$, it evaluates to true and if I plug in $x + \dfrac{1}{x} - \dfrac{1}{x} = 0$ it doesn't give an answer, as it does if $0$ is substituted for any real number.

64,Are Base Ten Logarithms Relics?,Are Base Ten Logarithms Relics?,,"Just interested in your thoughts regarding the contention that the pre-eminence of base ten logarithms is a relic from    pre-calculator days. Firstly I understand that finding the (base-10) logarithm of positive real numbers without a calculator can be reduced to finding the (base-10) logarithm of numbers (strictly) between 1 and 10 via scientific notation $$\log_{10}(x)=\log_{10}(a\times 10^n)=\log_{10}(a)+\log_{10}(10^n)=\log_{10}(a)+n,\,\,\,(*)$$ and that we could compile (approximate) logarithm tables for $1<a<10$ and hence we can calculate logs base 10. However this can now be done with a calculator... and why would you want to calculate $\log_{10}(x)$ in the first place? The next reason that we might need $\log_{10}(x)$ is to solve equations like $$b^x=n.$$ Now we know that $x=\log_bn$ but we can use the change of base ""formula"" to express this in terms of log base 10. Of course the change of base ""formula"" comes from a calculation like $$\begin{align} \log_{10}(b^x)&=\log_{10}n \\\Rightarrow x\log_{10}(b)&=\log_{10}n \\ \Rightarrow x&=\frac{\log_{10}n}{\log_{10}b}. \end{align}$$ However the new modern calculators can calculate $\log_bn$ in the first place. Then you could say what about solving  $$b^{f(x)}=c^{g(x)}.$$ Well you don't need to take a base-10 log: we have the perfectly good base $e$ natural log! In my presently narrow view, it seems to me that it is only stuff like the Richter Scale and sound intensity and similar derived quantities and scales that really use base-10 logs and that while base $e$ logs are clearly useful, that the pre-eminence of base 10 logs is due only to the the by-hand-calculation (*).

Of course $\max(a,b,c)=\max(a,\max(b,c))$ and so $$\max(a,b,c)=\frac{a+\frac{b+c+|b-c|}{2}+|a-\frac{b+c+|b-c|}{2}|}{2}$$ $$=\frac{a+0.5b+0.5c+0.5\left|b-c|+|a-0.5b-0.5c-0.5|b-c|\right|}{2}$$ but I'd like a form that shows the natural symmetry better and which doesn't have so many operations. This is a practical problem working on a system which has an absolute value operator but no maximum and not much ability to execute conditional statements, but to be honest the real reason I'm interedted is an attempt to beautify something that is seemingly ugly. For the practical side I need 5-10 arguments and it's acceptable to assume that all arguments are at least 0, though of course it would be much more satisfying if this latter assumption was not needed.",,['algebra-precalculus']

I might be doing this completely wrong and my apologies for that. Another solution came to me that if $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are roots of the other unknown equation. I can somehow manipulate that to find the answer. But I don't think that will work. All help is appreciated thank you.",,"['algebra-precalculus', 'roots', 'quadratics']"
