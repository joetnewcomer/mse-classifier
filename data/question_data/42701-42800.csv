0,Understanding of algebraic maps via number of inequalities in a semi-algebraic set,Understanding of algebraic maps via number of inequalities in a semi-algebraic set,,"Let $P_{(d,0,e)}(x) = dx^2 + e$ , and $Q_{(a,b,c)}(x) = ax^2 + bx+c$ be two polynomials in $\mathbb{R}[x]$ . Define an algebraic map $\phi:\mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{R}}^2 \times \mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{R}}^3 \to \mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{R}}^5$ that sends $((d,e),(a,b,c)) \in \mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{R}}^2 \times \mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{R}}^3$ to coefficents of multiplication of these two polynomials i.e. $(ad,bd,ae+cd,be,ce)\in \mathbb{A}_\mathbb{R}^5$ . The image of this map is described by $$\mathcal{M}_{P,Q} = \{(A,B,C,D,E) \in \mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{R}}^5: AD^2+B^2E=BCD \textit{ and  } C^2 \ge 4AE\}.$$ In general, we might have $P_v$ , and $Q_w$ , of degree at most $m$ and $n$ respectively, where $v$ and $w$ are vectors that can represent the polynomials (Note that just like the above example, we might have some forced zeros in $v$ and $w$ , but others are arbitrary numbers in $\mathbb{R}$ .). By Tarski-Seidenberg Theorem, we have that the image of the algebraic map $\phi$ is semi-algebraic i.e. it can be described by zeros of some polynomials and some inequalities. I'm wondering about the number of nonredundant inequalities that appear in $\mathcal{M}_{P,Q}$ . Based on a few examples that I checked, this number was one, like the example above or zero if the image of $\phi$ is closed. Is this true for an arbitrary $P_v$ and $Q_w$ ? $\textbf{Edit}$ : I would like to add two more examples to this post that shows if there is no fixed zero in $v$ , and $w$ then the problem is easier to handle. Example: Let $P_{(d,e)}(x) = dx+e$ , and $Q_{(a,b,c)}(x) = ax^2+bx+c$ then the map $\phi$ sends $$((d,e),(a,b,c)) \in \mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{R}}^2 \times \mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{R}}^3 \to (ad, bd+ae,cd+be,ce) \in \mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{R}}^4.$$ One can check that this map is surjective as every cubic polynomial in $\mathbb{R}$ has a real root corresponds to $dx+e$ and a degree 2 polynomial corresponds to $ax^2+bx+c$ . Example: Let $P_{(c,d)}(x) = cx+d$ and $Q_{(a,b)}(x)= ax+b$ then $\phi$ sends $$((c,d),(a,b)) \in \mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{R}}^2 \times \mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{R}}^2 \to (ac, ad+bc,bd) \in \mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{R}}^3.$$ Since not all degree 2 polynomials have real roots, we expect that this map is not surjective, so one can check that $$\mathcal{M} = \{(A,B,C)\in \mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{R}}^3: B^2-4AC \ge 0\}.$$ These two examples illustrate that if we don't have $\textbf{forced}$ zeros in $v$ and $w$ , then we are able to describe $\mathcal{M}$ . To be more precise, if $v$ and $w$ don't have forced zero then the image of $\phi$ is $m+n+1$ dimensional (it is not hard to justify this via roots of the target polynomial) and two cases happen: If $m$ and $n$ are odd simultaneously then the decomposition $P_vQ_w$ implies having at least two real roots, so $\phi$ is not surjective. In this case, we expect that the discriminant to appear as an inequality. If $m$ and $n$ are not odd simultaneously then this decomposition exists in $\mathbb{R}[x]$ . So, $\phi$ is surjective and we don't have any inequalities.","Let , and be two polynomials in . Define an algebraic map that sends to coefficents of multiplication of these two polynomials i.e. .

1,Galois group of $\mathbb{Q}(\underset{n\geq 1}{\bigcup}\mu_n)/\mathbb{Q}$,Galois group of,\mathbb{Q}(\underset{n\geq 1}{\bigcup}\mu_n)/\mathbb{Q},"I was trying to formalise the fact that $G_{\mu_\infty}:=Gal(\mathbb{Q}(\underset{n\geq 1}{\bigcup}\mu_n)/\mathbb{Q})\simeq \underset{n}{\varprojlim}\ (\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^{\times}=\hat{\mathbb{Z}}^{\times}$ . When I was done I tried finding something on this problem online to check my argument. The only things I was able to find are these two ancient posts here and here and the last page of these notes . The two posts only deal with the isomorphism $\underset{n}\varprojlim\ Gal(\mathbb{Q}(\mu_n)/\mathbb{Q})\simeq\underset{n}\varprojlim\ (\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^{\times}$ which is in my opinion the most trivial part of this problem whereas the short notes on infinite Galois theory do mention a subtlety involved but fail to make it precise. The subtelty here is that the isomorphism $G_{\mu_\infty}\simeq\underset{n}\varprojlim\ Gal(\mathbb{Q}(\mu_n)/\mathbb{Q})$ is not immediately obvious. Here is my attempt to formalise this Claim 1: The extenstion $\mathbb{Q}(\underset{n\geq 1}\bigcup\mu_n)/\mathbb{Q}$ is normal. Proof: Let $p(x)\in\mathbb{Q}[x]$ be an irreducible polynomial with a root $a\in\mathbb{Q}(\underset{n\geq 1}\bigcup\mu_n)$ Then $a$ is some finite expression in $\mu_{n_1},\dots,\mu_{n_i}$ for some $i\geq 1$ , involving field operations. Then letting $m:=lcm(n_1,\dots,n_i)$ we have that $a\in\mathbb{Q}(\mu_m)$ which is normal over $\mathbb{Q}$ . Hence $p(x)$ splits in $a\in\mathbb{Q}(\mu_m)$ and hence in $\mathbb{Q}(\underset{n\geq 1}\bigcup\mu_n)\ \ \ \blacksquare$ Remark: We immediately get that $\mathbb{Q}(\underset{n\geq 1}\bigcup\mu_n)/\mathbb{Q}$ is Galois since seperability is automatic. Hence we have that $\mathbb{Q}(\underset{n\geq 1}\bigcup\mu_n)=\underset{K}\bigcup K$ where $K$ runs over all Galois number fields contained in $\mathbb{Q}(\underset{n\geq 1}\bigcup\mu_n)$ . But we can actually improve this as follows. Claim 2: It suffices to have $K$ run over all abelian, Galois number fields contained in $\mathbb{Q}(\underset{n\geq 1}\bigcup\mu_n)$ . Proof: One containment is trivial. To see the other one, if $K$ is a Galois number field contained in $\mathbb{Q}(\underset{n\geq 1}\bigcup\mu_n)$ , write $K=\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ . Then by the above remark and the proof of the first claim we see that $\alpha\in\mathbb{Q}(\mu_m)$ for some $m$ . Hence $K\subset\mathbb{Q}(\mu_m)$ and since $K$ is Galois, we have by Galois theory that $Gal(K/\mathbb{Q})$ is isomorphic to a quotient of the abelian group $Gal(\mathbb{Q}(\mu_m)/\mathbb{Q})$ and hence is itself abelian. $\blacksquare$ Because of this we get an isomorphism $$G_{\mu_\infty}\simeq\underset{K}\varprojlim\ Gal(K/\mathbb{Q})$$ where now $K$ runs over all abelian Galois number fields contained in $\mathbb{Q}(\underset{n\geq 1}\bigcup\mu_n)$ and the inverse limit is with respect to inclusions of number fields. We now define the group homomorphism $$\phi:\underset{K}\varprojlim\ Gal(K/\mathbb{Q})\longrightarrow\underset{n}\varprojlim\ Gal(\mathbb{Q}(\mu_n)/\mathbb{Q})$$ where we just forget all non cyclotomic number fields and the inverse limit on the right is taken with respect to projections, for $m|n$ , $Gal(\mathbb{Q}(\mu_m)/\mathbb{Q})\longrightarrow Gal(\mathbb{Q}(\mu_n)/\mathbb{Q})$ . Claim 3: $\phi$ is an isomorphism. Proof : Let $(\sigma_K)\in\ker(\phi)$ , then $\sigma_{\mathbb{Q}(\mu_n)}=id, \forall n$ . Now from claim number 2 and its proof we see that given any abelian Galois number field $K$ contained in $\mathbb{Q}(\underset{n\geq 1}\bigcup\mu_n)$ , we have that $K\subset\mathbb{Q}(\mu_m)$ for some $m$ . Hence by the inverse system of $\underset{K}\varprojlim\ Gal(K/\mathbb{Q})$ we have that $\sigma_K=id$ , for all such $K$ . Hence $\phi$ injects. Now let $(\sigma_n)$ be any element of $\underset{n}\varprojlim\ Gal(\mathbb{Q}(\mu_n)/\mathbb{Q})$ . We define the element $(\sigma_K)\in\underset{K}\prod Gal(K/\mathbb{Q})$ as follows $$\sigma_K:=\sigma_m|_K, \text{if}\ K\subset\mathbb{Q}(\mu_m)\ \text{for some}\ m$$ Where again we've implicitly used claim number 2 for this definition. To see that this is well defined, suppose we have $K\subset\mathbb{Q}(\mu_n)\bigcap\mathbb{Q}(\mu_m)=\mathbb{Q}(\mu_d)$ , where $d=gcd(n,m)$ . Then since $d$ divides both $n$ and $m$ , we have by the inverse system of $\underset{n}\varprojlim\ Gal(\mathbb{Q}(\mu_n)/\mathbb{Q})$ that $\sigma_n|_K=\sigma_d|_K=\sigma_m|_K$ as required. We also have by construction that $(\sigma_K)\in\underset{K}\varprojlim\ Gal(K/\mathbb{Q})$ and maps to $(\sigma_n)$ under $\phi$ . Hence $\phi$ surjects $\blacksquare$ Hence indeed, in order to compute $G_{\mu_\infty}$ , it suffices to compute $\underset{n}\varprojlim\ Gal(\mathbb{Q}(\mu_n)/\mathbb{Q})$ . Also note that in place of claim number 2 we could have also used Kronecker-Webber but that would be a bit of an overkill? What i'd like to know is whether everthing here makes sense? Is it necessary? Can it be made shorter and/or more precise?","I was trying to formalise the fact that . When I was done I tried finding something on this problem online to check my argument.

10,Characterization of finite cyclic totally ramified extension of local fields with prime power degree,Characterization of finite cyclic totally ramified extension of local fields with prime power degree,,"Definition Let $G_K$ be the absolute Galois group of a local field $K$ . We will call a group homomorphism $\chi: G_K \to \mathbb{C}^*$ with finite image a character on $K$ . Since every finite subgroup of $\mathbb{C}^*$ is cyclic, it is generated by a primitive root of unity. So in our case, every character $\chi$ corresponds to a unique cyclic Galois extension $F/K$ of degree $n$ , the cardinality of the image of $\chi$ , and an isomorphism $$\bar{\chi}: \operatorname{Gal}(F/K) \xrightarrow{\sim} \langle \xi_n \rangle \subseteq \mathbb{C}^*$$ where $\xi_n$ is a primitive $n$ -th root of unity. Let $\chi$ be a character which is induced by a cyclic Galois extension $F/K$ with prime power degree. Furthermore, let $\operatorname{Frob}_K$ be a Frobenius element in $G_K$ , i.e. an element whose image is $x \mapsto x^{|\kappa(K)|}$ under the restriction homomorphism $G_K \to G_{\kappa(K)}$ where $\kappa(K)$ is the residue field of $K$ . By $F^{nr}$ , we denote the maximal unramified subextension of $F/K$ . I want to show that the following statements are equivalent: $F/K$ is totally ramified, $F^{nr} = K$ , the image of $\operatorname{Frob}_K$ in $\operatorname{Gal}(F/K)$ is the identity element, $\chi(\operatorname{Frob}_K)=1$ . I think I was able to show the equivalences 1. $\Leftrightarrow$ 2. and 3. $\Leftrightarrow$ 4., so I am interested in the characterization from 1./2. to 3./4 and vice versa. Ideas : $\bar{\chi}$ is injective on $\operatorname{Gal}(F/K)$ . The image of $\operatorname{Frob}_K$ under $G_K \to \operatorname{Gal}(F/K) \simeq G_K/\operatorname{Gal}(\bar{K}/F)$ is the Frobenius element in $\operatorname{Gal}(F/K)$ (Usually, a Frobenius element is unique up to conjugacy. But since $F/K$ is cyclic, it is unique indeed.). It should be the generator of $\operatorname{Gal}(F/K)$ . The inertia subgroup $I_{F/K}$ of $\operatorname{Gal}(F/K)$ is the unique cyclic subgroup of order $e$ , the ramification index of $F/K$ . We can identify $\operatorname{Gal}(F/K)/I_{F/K}$ with $\operatorname{Gal}(F^{nr}/K)$ . A generator of this group is the image of $\operatorname{Frob}_K$ , I think.

So here's how it goes: $\begin{CD}@. @. @. 0 @>>> A_1 @>\chi>> P @>\sigma>> A @>>> 0\\ @. @. @. @. @. @. @| \\ 0 @>>> P_n @>\chi_n>> P_{n-1} @>\chi_{n-1}>> ... @>\chi_2>> P_1 @>\chi_1>> P_0 @>\chi_0>> A @>0>> 0 \\ \end{CD}$ Since $\sigma$ is epic, and $P_0$ is projective, hence there exists: $\gamma_0: P_0 \to P$, such that the square commutes: $\begin{CD}@. @. @. 0 @>>> A_1 @>\chi>> P @>\sigma>> A @>>> 0\\ @. @. @. @. @. @A\gamma_0AA @| \\ 0 @>>> P_n @>\chi_n>> P_{n-1} @>\chi_{n-1}>> ... @>\chi_2>> P_1 @>\chi_1>> P_0 @>\chi_0>> A @>0>> 0 \\ \end{CD}$ Since $\sigma (\gamma_0 \chi_1) = 0$, and the former row is exact, hence there exists $\gamma_1: P_1 \to A$, such that the square commutes. $\begin{CD}@. @. @. 0 @>>> A_1 @>\chi>> P @>\sigma>> A @>>> 0\\ @. @. @. @. @A\gamma_1AA @A\gamma_0AA @| \\ 0 @>>> P_n @>\chi_n>> P_{n-1} @>\chi_{n-1}>> ... @>\chi_2>> P_1 @>\chi_1>> P_0 @>\chi_0>> A @>0>> 0 \\ \end{CD}$ One problem remains is that $\gamma_1$ is not epic, so, I cannot have the resolution: $0 \to P_n \to ... \to P_1 \to A_1 \to 0$. Can my proof be improved, or should I tackle it in a complete different way? Thank you guys very much in advance, And have a good day, Edit I still don't see how we can use Schanuel's lemma to tackle this problem, ok so I assume $\mbox{Pd}(A) < n + 1$, i.e, I'll have the resolution $\begin{CD} @. @. @. @. @. 0 \\ @. @. @. @. @. @VVV \\ 0 @>>> P_n @>>> P_{n - 1} @>>> ... @>>> P_0 @>>> A_1 @>>> 0 \\ @. @. @. @. @. @VVV \\ @. @. @. @. @.

Say for example, from 123 to 312? $$ e: \begin{cases}            \alpha \mapsto \alpha \\           \beta \mapsto \beta   \end{cases} $$ $$ r: \begin{cases}            \alpha \mapsto \omega^2\alpha \\           \beta \mapsto \omega\beta   \end{cases} $$ $$ r^2: \begin{cases}            \alpha \mapsto \omega\alpha \\           \beta \mapsto \omega^2\beta   \end{cases} $$ $$ s_0: \begin{cases}            \alpha \mapsto \omega\beta \\           \beta \mapsto \omega^2\alpha   \end{cases} $$ $$ s_1: \begin{cases}            \alpha \mapsto \omega^2\beta \\           \beta \mapsto \omega\alpha   \end{cases} $$ $$ s_2: \begin{cases}            \alpha\omega \mapsto \omega\beta \\           \alpha\beta \mapsto \omega\beta   \end{cases} $$ We can check that we can go from 123 to 312 by applying the $r$ mapping to the labels, which corresponds to rotation by -120 degrees: $$ \begin{cases}    r(\;Label\;1\;) &= r(\alpha+\beta)               &= r(\alpha)+r(\beta)                   &= \omega^2\alpha+\omega\beta &=\;Label\;3\\   r(\;Label\;2\;) &= r(\omega\alpha+\omega^2\beta) &= \omega r(\alpha)+\omega^2 r(\beta)   &=    \omega (\omega^2\alpha)+\omega^2 (\omega\beta)     &= \alpha+\beta = \;Label\;1\\    r(\;Label\;3\;) &= r(\omega^2\alpha+\omega\beta) &= \omega^2 r(\alpha) + \omega r(\beta) &=   \omega^2 (\omega^2\alpha) + \omega (\omega\beta) &= \omega\alpha + \omega^2\beta = \; Label\; 2 \end{cases} $$ So, $$r(123)\mapsto 312$$ Now my question is, where may I find the solution of the general quartic $$x^4+px^2+qx+r$$ in terms of one of the roots being in the form $\alpha+\beta+\gamma$ analogous to the way the solution to the cubic above has one of the roots in the form $\alpha+\beta$ ?

73,Local factors determine Weil representations - proof of the cyclic case,Local factors determine Weil representations - proof of the cyclic case,,"I want to understand the proof of the following Theorem from ""Euler Factors determine Weil Representations"" by Tim and Vladimir Dokchitser : Theorem 1 Every Frobenius-semisimple Weil representation $\rho$ is uniquely determined by its local polynomials $P(\rho/F,T)$ over finite separable extensions $F/K$. Before we talk about the cyclic case of the proof, let us recall some definitions first: Let $K$ be a local field and $G_K = \operatorname{Gal}(\bar{K}/K)$ be the absolute Galois group of $K$. An (arithmetic) Frobenius element is any element $\operatorname{Frob}_K \in G_K$ that acts as $x \mapsto x^{|k|}$ on $\bar{k}$, the algebraic closure of the residue field $k$ of $K$. The Weil group $W_K$ is the subgroup of $G_K$ of all automorphisms that act as an integral power of Frobenius on the residue field. A Weil representation is a representation $\rho: W_K \to \operatorname{GL}_n(\mathbb{C})$ such that $\rho(I_K)$ is finite. It is called Frobenius-semisimple if the image of some (equivalently, any) Frobenius element is diagonalizable. The local polynomial $P(\rho,T)$ is the inverse characteristic polynomial of $\operatorname{Frob}_K^{-1}$ on the inertia invariants of $\rho$, i.e. $$P(\rho,T) = \det(1-T \cdot \operatorname{Frob_K^{-1}}).$$ Similarly, for a finite extension $F/K$, we write $P(\rho/F)$ for the local polynomial of the restriction of $\rho$ to $W_F$, i.e. $$P(\rho/F,T) = P(\rho|_{W_F},T).$$ Now I would like to talk about the proof of the cyclic case which is given in the paper: Step 1: Cyclic. Suppose $\rho$ factors through a finite cyclic group $G = \operatorname{Gal}(F/K) \simeq C_n$ and $F/K$ has ramification degree $e$. By Lemma 2 (cf. below), there is a cyclic totally ramified extension $K/K$ of degree $e$ such that $FL/L$ is unramified of degree $n$. The restriction map $\operatorname{Gal}(FL/L) \to \operatorname{Gal}(F/K)$ is an isomorphism, as it is clearly injective and both groups have order $n$. So $\rho/L$ determines $\rho$, and $\rho/L$ can be recovered from its local polynomial $P(\rho/L,T)$. In our proof we used the following Lemma which we shall take for granted in this post: Lemma 2 Let $F/K$ be a cyclic extension of degree $n$ and ramification degree $e$.

Thank you in advance!","I want to understand the proof of the following Theorem from ""Euler Factors determine Weil Representations"" by Tim and Vladimir Dokchitser : Theorem 1 Every Frobenius-semisimple Weil representation $\rho$ is uniquely determined by its local polynomials $P(\rho/F,T)$ over finite separable extensions $F/K$. Before we talk about the cyclic case of the proof, let us recall some definitions first: Let $K$ be a local field and $G_K = \operatorname{Gal}(\bar{K}/K)$ be the absolute Galois group of $K$. An (arithmetic) Frobenius element is any element $\operatorname{Frob}_K \in G_K$ that acts as $x \mapsto x^{|k|}$ on $\bar{k}$, the algebraic closure of the residue field $k$ of $K$. The Weil group $W_K$ is the subgroup of $G_K$ of all automorphisms that act as an integral power of Frobenius on the residue field. A Weil representation is a representation $\rho: W_K \to \operatorname{GL}_n(\mathbb{C})$ such that $\rho(I_K)$ is finite. It is called Frobenius-semisimple if the image of some (equivalently, any) Frobenius element is diagonalizable. The local polynomial $P(\rho,T)$ is the inverse characteristic polynomial of $\operatorname{Frob}_K^{-1}$ on the inertia invariants of $\rho$, i.e. $$P(\rho,T) = \det(1-T \cdot \operatorname{Frob_K^{-1}}).$$ Similarly, for a finite extension $F/K$, we write $P(\rho/F)$ for the local polynomial of the restriction of $\rho$ to $W_F$, i.e. $$P(\rho/F,T) = P(\rho|_{W_F},T).$$ Now I would like to talk about the proof of the cyclic case which is given in the paper: Step 1: Cyclic. Suppose $\rho$ factors through a finite cyclic group $G = \operatorname{Gal}(F/K) \simeq C_n$ and $F/K$ has ramification degree $e$. By Lemma 2 (cf. below), there is a cyclic totally ramified extension $K/K$ of degree $e$ such that $FL/L$ is unramified of degree $n$. The restriction map $\operatorname{Gal}(FL/L) \to \operatorname{Gal}(F/K)$ is an isomorphism, as it is clearly injective and both groups have order $n$. So $\rho/L$ determines $\rho$, and $\rho/L$ can be recovered from its local polynomial $P(\rho/L,T)$. In our proof we used the following Lemma which we shall take for granted in this post: Lemma 2 Let $F/K$ be a cyclic extension of degree $n$ and ramification degree $e$. Then there exists a cyclic totally ramified extension $L/K$ of degree $e$ such that $FL/L$ is unramified of degree $n$. Now I have the following specific questions about the proof above: Could you give me a good argument why the restriction map $\operatorname{Gal}(FL/L) \to \operatorname{Gal}(F/K)$ is injective?

Claim: For any $R$ and $f\in R[x]$, $f$ is $2$-severable if and only if there is no periodic element in $R$ of odd period under the iteration $f$. To be honest, I haven't tried much beyond the above examples, and I feel that it is hopeless to obtain an explicit criterion for the severability of a general polynomial. So to narrow down the question, here is what I mainly interest in: Question: Is there any $n$-severable polynomial $f$ over $\Bbb{Q}$ with $n\geq3$? For the case $n=3$, I only calculated a few linear functions $f=ax_1+bx_2$ and didn't find any satisfied one yet. Also, for any $n\geq 2$, there is an $n$-severable polynomial $n(n-1)/2-(x_1+\cdots+x_{n-1})$ over $\Bbb{Z}/n\Bbb{Z}$, so it induces a collection of $n$-severable polynomials over $\Bbb{Z}$, but I've no idea whether any of them is severable over $\Bbb{Q}$. Any advise or guidance would be appreciated. Update: I also posted it on MO .",,"['abstract-algebra', 'number-theory', 'polynomials', 'dynamical-systems']"
83,Galois group of $x^4-2x^2+2$. Apparent contradiction!!,Galois group of . Apparent contradiction!!,x^4-2x^2+2,"I'm trying to compute de Galois group of $p(x) = x^4-2x^2+2$, and I seem to have arrived to a contradiction, which of course means that there is some mistake that I'm not able to find. The first thing I did was to compute the roots: $\alpha_1 = \sqrt[4]2 \space e^{\pi i/8}$ $\alpha_2 = -\sqrt[4]2 \space e^{\pi i/8}$ $\alpha_3 = \sqrt[4]2 \space e^{-\pi i/8}$ $\alpha_4 = -\sqrt[4]2 \space e^{-\pi i/8}$ From the expressions, one can see that: $\alpha_3 = \alpha_1^{15} \space \frac{\sqrt 2}{16}$ So that $\sqrt 2$ is in the splitting field, and with $\sqrt 2$ and $\alpha_1$ it's possible to generate the other roots. Therefore, the splitting field must be: $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt 2,\alpha_1)$ We need to see if the degree is equal to 4 or 8. If the degree of $\alpha_1$ over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt 2)$ is 4, the total degree will be 8. And this is the case, because $p(x)$ splits in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt 2)[x]$ if and only if there are $\alpha_i$ and $\alpha_j$ so that $(x-\alpha_i)(x-\alpha_j)$ have coefficients in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt 2)$, which applying Cardano's formulas requires $\alpha_i + \alpha_j \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt 2)$ and $\alpha_i  \alpha_j \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt 2)$. It's easy to rule out all combinations of $\alpha_i$ and $\alpha_j$ (perhaps easier if one considers the expression $\alpha_i = \pm\sqrt[4]{2} (\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2+\sqrt2} \pm \frac{i}{2}\sqrt{2-\sqrt2})$), and to prove that it's not possible, so that the degree of the extension is 8. In this point, the Galois group $G$ can be seen as a subgroup of $S_4$ (because the group acts permuting the four roots) of order 8, so that, according to the structure of subgroups of $S_4$ (see https://groupprops.subwiki.org/wiki/Symmetric_group:S4 ), the Galois group is isomorphic to $D_8$. However, I wanted a more direct proof, using the expression of the splitting field, which allows us to consider the group as acting on $\alpha_1$ (sending it to either $\alpha_1$, $\alpha_2$, $\alpha_3$ or $\alpha_4$) and $\sqrt 2$ (sending it to $\sqrt 2$ or $-\sqrt 2$). Using this, the Galois automorphisms have to be: \begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline & \sigma(\alpha_1) & \sigma(\sqrt 2) \\ \hline \sigma_1 & \alpha_1 & \sqrt 2\\ \hline \sigma_2 &  \alpha_2 &\sqrt 2\\ \hline \sigma_3 & \alpha_3 &\sqrt 2\\ \hline \sigma_4 & \alpha_4 &\sqrt 2\\ \hline \sigma_5 & \alpha_1 &-\sqrt 2\\ \hline \sigma_6 & \alpha_2 &-\sqrt 2\\ \hline \sigma_7 & \alpha_3 &-\sqrt 2\\ \hline \sigma_8 & \alpha_4 &-\sqrt 2\\ \hline \end{array} Moreover, we can consider these two subgroups: $N = Gal(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt 2,\alpha_1)/\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt 2)) = \{\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\sigma_3,\sigma_4\}$ $H = Gal(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt 2,\alpha_1)/\mathbb{Q}(\alpha_1)) = \{\sigma_1,\sigma_5\}$ $N$ is normal, because the field extension $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt 2)/\mathbb{Q}$ is a normal extension. And $N\cap H = \{\sigma_1\}$, so that $N H= G$ and $G = N \rtimes H$ It seems that we are arriving to the same conclusion, but we need to prove that $N \simeq \mathbb{Z}_4$ in order to end. And this is the point that fails, because all elements of $N$ are of order $1$ or $2$: $\sigma_2^2(\alpha_1) = \sigma_2(\alpha_2) = \sigma_2(-\alpha_1) = -\alpha_2 = \alpha_1$ $\sigma_3^2(\alpha_1) = \sigma_3(\alpha_3) = \sigma_3(\alpha_1^{15} \space \frac{\sqrt 2}{16}) = \alpha_3^{15} \space \frac{\sqrt 2}{16} = \alpha_1$ $\sigma_4^2(\alpha_1) = \sigma_4(\alpha_4) = \sigma_4(-\alpha_1^{15} \space \frac{\sqrt 2}{16}) = -\alpha_4^{15} \space \frac{\sqrt 2}{16} = \alpha_1$ So that $N \simeq \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$, and $G \simeq (\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2)\rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2$ Please, can you tell me where is the mistake??

85,Only One Field with Four Elements,Only One Field with Four Elements,,"As I started typing this up, I realized I made a mistake somewhere but I cannot identify it. Prove that any two fields having exactly four elements are isomorphic. [Hint: First prove that $1+1=0$, and then show that the nonzero elements form a cyclic group of order $3$ under multiplication] First I will prove a few things about fields with four elements before demonstrating the isomorphism. Let $F= \{0,1,a,b\}$ be a field with four elements. First of all, since $F$ is a field, every nonzero element is a unit, meaning that the group of units $U(F)$ is a multiplicative group of $3$ which makes it isomorphic to $\Bbb{Z}_3$, and hence $U(F)$ is cyclic. Now I will prove that $1+1=0$. Note that $(1+1)^2 = (1+1)(1+1) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 0$, where the last equality follows because $F$ is an additive group of order $4$. Since $F$ is a field, there can be no nonzero divisors, implying that $1 + 1 = 0$. Now I will prove that $a+b =0$, which can also be used to prove $1+1$ since $(-a)^3 = 1$ implies $-1 = 1$ (is this right?). If $a+b$ weren't zero, then it would be a unit and hence have a multiplicative order of $3$. That is, $(a+b)^3 = 1$ or $1 + 3a^2b + 3a b^2 = 0$. Multiplying by $a$ and then $b$ yields the two equations $a + 3b + 3a^2 b^2 = 0$ and $b + 3a^2 b^2 + 3a = 0$, and adding the two gives $4a + 4b + 6a^2 b^2 = 0$ or $6a^2 b^2 = 0$, which is a contradiction since neither $a=0$ nor $b=0$.  Hence $a + b = 0$ or $b = -a$. Therefore $F = \{0,1,a,-a\}$ (Perhaps the mistake was made here?) Now we compute some products and sums of elements in $F$. It is clear that $1+a = -a$, for $1+a=0$ implies $a=1$, a contradiction, and $1+a=a$ implies $1=0$, another contradiction...Hold on! Either $a^2 = 1$, $a^2 = a$, or $a^2 = -a$, but all lead to a contradiction...I must have made a mistake somewhere. EDIT: Okay. We still have $(1+1)^2 = 0$ implies $1+1 = 0$, and because $U(F)$ is a cyclic group, it's easy to see that $b = a^2$. Now let $F_1 = \{0,1,a,a^2\}$ and $F_2 = \{0',1',b,b^2\}$ be two fields with four elements. Define the map $f : F_1 \to F_2$ by $f(0)=0'$, $f(1)=1'$, $f(a) = b$, and $f(a^2)=b^2$. Clearly this is bijective, and so all that remains is to show that it is a ring homomorphism. Let us first prove additivity. First note that $a+a = a(1+1) = a \cdot 0 = 0$; and $a+1 = a^2$ otherwise we obtain a contradiction; and finally $a + a^2 = a(a+1) = a \cdot a^2 = 1$. Hence $f(a + a ) = f(0) = 0' = b + b = f(a) + f(a)$; and $f(a+1) = f(a^2) = b^2 = b+1 = f(a) + f(1)$; and finally $f(a+a^2) = f(1) = 1 = b + b^2 = f(a) + f(a^2)$. Now we prove that $f$ is multiplicative. Note that $f(1 \cdot x) = f(x) = f(1) f(x)$; and that $f(a \cdot a) = f(a^2) = b^2 = b \cdot b = f(a) f(a)$; and finally $f(a \cdot a^2) = f(a^3 ) = f(1) = 1 = b^3 = b \cdot b^2 = f(a) f(a^2)$.

We have to prove $(\mathfrak M^{-1})_S=(\mathfrak M_S)^{-1}$. My attempt was : for $x = \frac as  \in (\mathfrak M^{-1})_S$ where $a \in \mathfrak M^{-1}$.

Please give detail information please.","I was studying fractional field from ""Algebraic Number fields"" Janusz and I am stuck in two problems First let me give you some definitions: 1) Fractional field : Let $R$ be a Dedekind ring and $K$ be its quotient field. A fractional field of $R$ is a nonzero finitely generated $R$-submodule of $K$. 2) If $\mathfrak M$ is a fractional ideal of $R$, then $\mathfrak M^{-1}$ is the set $\{x \in K  : x\mathfrak M \subseteq R\}$. We call it inverse of $\mathfrak M$. Now questions are: 1) Let $S$ be a multiplicative set in $R$ define $\mathfrak M_S=\mathfrak MR_S(=S^{-1}\mathfrak M)$ localization of $\mathfrak M$ at S. We have to prove $(\mathfrak M^{-1})_S=(\mathfrak M_S)^{-1}$. My attempt was : for $x = \frac as  \in (\mathfrak M^{-1})_S$ where $a \in \mathfrak M^{-1}$. Now for any $y=\frac {m}{s_1} \in \mathfrak M_S$. So we have $xy = \frac {am}{ss_1}\in R_S$ Hence, $(\mathfrak M^{-1})_S \subseteq (\mathfrak M _S)^{-1}$ Conversely, for any $z \in (\mathfrak M_S)^{-1}$ then $z(\mathfrak M_S) \subseteq R_S$ Hence, $z \frac ms= \frac {r}{s_1}$ From here how can I prove that $z$ can be written as $\frac {x_3}{s_3}$ such that $x_3 \in \mathfrak M^{-1}$ and $s_3 \in S$. I was thinking that here I have to use finitely generation of $M$.

89,Gauss' lemma for arbitrary integral domains,Gauss' lemma for arbitrary integral domains,,"One of the versions of the classical Gauss' lemma in abstract algebra states the following: Theorem: Let $R$ be an integral domain, $f\in R[X]$ of positive degree and $K$ the quotient field of $R$ .
