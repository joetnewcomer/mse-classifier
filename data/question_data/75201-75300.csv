Are these two isomorphic as topological groups? Some preliminaries: Let $\mathbb{M_n}$ denote the set of $n\times n$ matrices with real entries. We identify each matrix $A=(a_{ij}) \in \mathbb{M_n}$ with the corresponding point $(a_{11},a_{12},...,a_{1n},a_{21},a_{22}...,a_{2n},...,a_{n1},a_{n2},...,a_{nn}) \in \mathbb{E}^{n^2}$ , thus giving $\mathbb{M_n}$ the subspace topology. The orthogonal group $O(n)$ denotes the group of orthogonal $n \times n$ matrices $A \in \mathbb{M_n}$ , i.e. with $det(A)=\pm{1}$ . The special orthogonal group $SO(n)$ denotes the subgroup of $O(n)$ with $det(A)=1$ . $Z_2=\{-1, 1\}$ denotes the multiplicative group of order 2. My attempt For odd $n$ , the answer to both questions is yes , as we verify below. Consider the mapping $f:O(n)\to SO(n)\times Z_2, A \mapsto(det(A)\cdot A, det(A))$ . We have the following facts about $f$ : It is injective. If $f(A)=f(B)$ then $(det(A)\cdot A, det(A))=(det(B)\cdot B, det(B))$ . Therefore, $det(A)=det(B) \neq 0$ so $A=B$ . It is surjective. For $(D,d) \in SO(n) \times Z_2$ , we can take $dD \in O(n)$ , giving $f(dD)=(det(dD)\cdot dD, det(dD))=(d^n\cdot det(D) \cdot dD,d^n \cdot det(D))=(d^{n+1}D, d^n)=(D,d)$ , since $n$ is odd. It is a homomorphism. $f(AB)=(det(AB)\cdot AB, det(AB))=(det(A)det(B)\cdot AB, det(A)det(B))$ $=((det(A)\cdot A)(det(B)\cdot B), det(A)det(B))=f(A)f(B)$ . It is continuous. Let $\mathcal{O} \in SO(n) \times Z_2$ be open. Then $\mathcal{O}=U \times V$ for $U$ open in $SO(n)$ and $V$ open in $Z_2$ . Since $SO(n)$ is open in $O(n)$ , $U$ is therefore open in $O(n)$ . $-U=\{-A\mid A\in U\}$ is also open in $O(n)$ . But $f^{-1}(\mathcal{O})=f^{-1}(U\times V)=U\cup -U$ . Since $O(n)$ is compact and $SO(n)\times Z_2$ is Hausdorff, we therefore have that $f$ is a homeomorphism. Thus, they are isomorphic as topological groups. For even $n$ , this mapping is not well-defined: if $A \in O(n)$ with $det(A)=-1$ then, $det(det(A)\cdot A)=(det(A))^{n+1}=-1$ , so $det(A)\cdot A \notin SO(n)$ . My question then is are they homeomorphic as topological spaces if $n$ is even?

EDIT2: If we  ask that for every there is a neighborhood such that is a neighborhood of and is a homeomorphism : Let an open of such that and an open of such that then we consider the open whose image is an open of (because it is an open of and is open) and we have a homeomorphism . However I don't understand the terminology of étale space because we say that is an étale space of if there is a local homeomorphism so an open subset of would be an étale space. Am I wrong?

However, some of the exercises are pretty brutal, so one I have been stuck on is (page.129/exercise 47) Suppose $A,B\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ (a) If $A$ and $B$ are homeomorphic, are their complements homeomorphic (b) If $A$ and $B$ are homeomorphic and compact, are their complements homeomorphic (c) If $A$ and $B$ are homeomorphic, compact and connected, are their complements homeomorphic As the conditions get progressively more restrictive, I am very sure, that only the last one has a chance of being true and indeed, it is . For the first one, I simply used the fact, that $(0,1)$ is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}$ , but their complements are not homeomorphic, and set $A=(0,1)\times \{0\}$ and $B=\mathbb{R}\times\{0\}$ , where the complement of $A$ is connected, while the complement of $B$ is not.

I can probably wager, that both $A$ and $B$ are disconnected, and that the counterexample will arise from the complement of $A$ being disconnected, while the complement of $B$ will be connected, as that has been the only tool mentioned so far for distinguishing non homeomorphic sets.","I am studying Real Analysis with the book ""Real mathematical analysis"" and it has been a very challenging (but not impossible) read for me so far.

99,Is Sequence Convergence a topological Invariant?,Is Sequence Convergence a topological Invariant?,,"I am stuck on a question that goes like this: Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space, and let $A \subseteq X$ . $A$ is called sequentially closed if the limit point of every convergent sequence $\{x_n\} \subseteq A$ is in $A$ . We already know that every closed set is sequentially closed. $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is called sequential if every sequentially closed subset is closed. Show that the property of being sequential is a topological invariant. I have a solution but that relies on the postulate that sequence convergence is a topological invariant. Here is my proof: Let's suppose we have two topological spaces $(X, \mathcal{T})$ and $(Y, \mathcal{U})$ that are homeomorphic, with a homeomorphism $f: X \to Y$ . We want to show that if $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is sequential, then $(Y, \mathcal{U})$ is also sequential, and vice versa. First, let's prove that if $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is sequential, then $(Y, \mathcal{U})$ is sequential. We need to show that every sequentially closed subset $B \subseteq Y$ is closed in $(Y, \mathcal{U})$ Suppose $B$ is a sequentially closed subset of $(Y, \mathcal{U})$ . We want to prove that $B$ is closed in $(Y, \mathcal{U})$ . Consider the preimage $A = f^{-1}(B) \subseteq X$ . Since $f$ is a homeomorphism, $A$ is a subset of $X$ , and we have $f(A) = B$ Now, let ${y_n}$ be a convergent sequence in $B$ with limit point $y$ . Since $f$ is a homeomorphism, the preimage ${x_n} = f^{-1}({y_n})$ is a convergent sequence in $A$ with limit point $x = f^{-1}(y)$ . Since $A$ is sequentially closed in $(X, \mathcal{T})$ , $x$ belongs to $A$ . By continuity of $f$ , we have $f(x) = y$ . Thus, $y$ is in the image of $A$ under $f$ , which is $B$ . Therefore, $B$ contains its limit point $y$ , and $B$ is closed in $(Y, \mathcal{U})$ . Hence, if $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is sequential, then $(Y, \mathcal{U})$ is also sequential The converse that $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is sequential if $(Y, \mathcal{U})$ is can also be proven in the same way as there was nothing special about $(Y, \mathcal{U})$ . Therefore, we have shown that the property of being sequential is a topological invariant. Any comments on my proof/idea is welcome. I need help in solving this problem.","I am stuck on a question that goes like this: Let be a topological space, and let . is called sequentially closed if the limit point of every convergent sequence is in .
