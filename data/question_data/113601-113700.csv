0,Subgroup of coprime order with automorphism group is contained in center of group,Subgroup of coprime order with automorphism group is contained in center of group,,"I'm studying for a qualifying exam in algebra and I've come across the following problem: Let $G$ be a finite group with a subgroup $N$ . Let $Aut(G)$ be the group of automorphisms of $G$ . Prove that if $|Aut(G)|$ and $|N|$ are relatively prime, then $N$ is contained in the center of $G$ . I'm struggling to find a good way to approach this. I'm able to prove a similar result that if $|G|$ and $|Aut(G)|$ are relatively prime, then $G$ is abelian: Let $\theta$ be a homomorphism from $G$ to the inner automorphism group of $G$ , denoted $\theta:G\rightarrow Inn(G)$ . Then because inner automorphisms are conjugations by fixed elements, the kernel of $\theta$ is the center of $G$ , denoted $ker(\theta)=Z(G)$ . By the first isomorphism theorem, it follows that $G/Z(G)\cong Inn(G)\subseteq Aut(G)$ . Hence, by Lagrange's theorem, $|G/Z(G)|$ divides $|Aut(G)|$ . Similarly, by consequence of Lagrange's theorem, $|G/Z(G)||Z|=|G|$ , as $Z(G)$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ . Since $|G/Z(G)|$ divides $|G|$ and $|Aut(G)|$ , and $|G|$ and $|Aut(G)|$ are relatively prime, it follows that $|G/Z(G)|=1$ , implying that $G=Z(G)$ . The desired result follows. $\blacksquare$ It's not obvious to me how to transform this proof into one of the desired problem (or if there even is a good way to simply modify what I already have). If I knew that $N$ were a normal subgroup, I could potentially apply the same kind of argument using Lagrange's theorem, but I don't have that assumption. Without more information on the structure of $G$ , it doesn't seem likely that I'll be able to use an element argument to show that $N\subseteq Z(G)$ .","I'm studying for a qualifying exam in algebra and I've come across the following problem: Let be a finite group with a subgroup .

1,Conjugacy of Singer cyclic groups in $\mathrm{P\Gamma L}$,Conjugacy of Singer cyclic groups in,\mathrm{P\Gamma L},"Motivation This is kind of a follow-up to this question on conjugacy of Singer cyclic groups in GL . The ""original"" definition of a Singer cycle is not in the GL, but the following slightly different geometric setting: Definition A cyclic group $\Sigma$ of collineations of a finite projective geometry $\mathrm{PG}(k-1,q)$ is called a Singer cyclic group if $\Sigma$ acts regularly on the set of points.  (Any generator of a Singer cyclic group is called a Singer cycle ). The group of collineations of $\mathrm{PG}(k-1,q)$ is given by $\mathrm{P\Gamma L}(k,q)$ (with its natural action on the set of subspaces of $\mathrm{GF}(q)^k$ ). Necessarily, the order of $\Sigma$ equals the number of points in $\mathrm{PG}(k-1,q)$ , which is $\frac{q^{k}-1}{q-1}$ . Question Are any two Singer cyclic subgroups of $\mathrm{P\Gamma L}(k,q)$ conjugate? First thoughts My feeling is that the answer should still be ""yes"", but I don't know for sure. A first step could be to think about the question in PGL: Take a Singer cycle, find a Singer cycle preimage in GL and apply the GL-result. However, so far I don't see a rigorous argument why there should always be a suitable preimage in GL.","Motivation This is kind of a follow-up to this question on conjugacy of Singer cyclic groups in GL .

I've then found this interesting problem: Let a group $G$ acting on $\Omega$ and take $\alpha,\beta\in\Omega$ , $x\in G$ and $\alpha^x=\beta$ (meaning $x$ acts on $\alpha$ to get $\beta$ ).   Show that if $y\in G$ and $\alpha^y=\beta$ $\implies \exists g\in \operatorname{Stab}(\alpha)$ s.t. $y=gx$ , i.e. $y\in \operatorname{Stab}(\alpha)x$ . In words, this is tantamount to claim all group elements moving $\alpha$ to $\beta$ belong to the group set given by the stabilizer elements of $\alpha$ followed by a guess element moving $\alpha$ to $\beta$ . To get a better visual mental grasp on it, I've used the rotational symmetries of a cube acting on the set of cube faces. In this case, given a rotation moving a face onto another one, we can get the full rotations which realise the same thing using the stabilizer subgroup of each face. This is the set of rotations around an axis perp to the face mid point, and is isomorphic to a cyclic group of order 4. So, taking each stabilizer rotation followed by the initial rotation from one face to the target one, gives you back the full list of moves. That said, I've tried to show that such $g$ element exists (problem 3.3 of Groups and Characters book) but I'm not fully sure this demo is complete. It goes like this: Let's take the element $g\in G$ s.t. $y=gx$ , i.e. $g=yx^{-1}$ . We can also claim $\alpha^y=\alpha^x$ so, replacing the y: $$\alpha^{gx}=\alpha^x \implies (\alpha^g)^x = \alpha^x$$ But this can be true only iff: $$\alpha^g=\alpha \implies g\in \operatorname{Stab}(\alpha) \implies y\in \operatorname{Stab}(\alpha)x$$ I was wondering if this is enough, or if I'm missing something. I mean: is this enough to proof that the elements $\in \operatorname{Stab}(\alpha)x$ are the only ones bringing $\alpha$ to $\beta$ ? I was also wondering if there could be a reductio ad absurdum possible version of this, i.e. ""Let's suppose such $g \notin \operatorname{Stab}(\alpha)$ . . . "" and deriving from it a contradiction.

So, taking each stabilizer rotation followed by the initial rotation from one face to the target one, gives you back the full list of moves. That said, I've tried to show that such element exists (problem 3.3 of Groups and Characters book) but I'm not fully sure this demo is complete. It goes like this: Let's take the element s.t. , i.e. . We can also claim so, replacing the y: But this can be true only iff: I was wondering if this is enough, or if I'm missing something.

14,Galois Groups are isomorphic to subgroups of symmetric groups.,Galois Groups are isomorphic to subgroups of symmetric groups.,,"I am currently working through Joseph Rotman's book ""Galois Theory"" and am trying to prove the following theorem. If $f(x) \in F[x]$ has $n$ distinct roots in its splitting field $E$ , then $\operatorname{Gal}(E/F)$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_n$ , thus its order is a divisor of $n!$ . I have struggled to understand the proof in the book and have therefore tried to write my own proof of this fact, I have found some questions close to this on this site, but haven't been able to find exactly what I'm looking for. My proof (so far) is as follows: Proof: Let $X = \{\alpha_1, ... , \alpha_n \}$ be the set of roots of $f(x)$ , as $E$ is the splitting field of $f$ , it may be written as $E = F(\alpha_1, ... , \alpha_n)$ and noting that $\alpha_i \neq \alpha_j$ for $i\neq j$ .

Now I try to show that $g$ is injective, consider $\sigma, \phi \in \operatorname{Gal}(E/F)$ where $\sigma \neq \phi$ , both of these functions are F-automorphisms of $E/F$ , so they ""fix"" $F$ , then we can conclude that $\sigma$ and $\phi$ can be different if and only if they act differently on $X$ , which in the language of mathematics is precisely $\sigma \neq \phi \Leftrightarrow \sigma_X \neq \phi_X$ . This is the definition of an injective function. This means that $\left|\operatorname{Gal}(E/F)\right| \leq |S_n| = n!$ , however due to having constructed a homomorphism, we have mapped a group  to another group, hence we have mapped $\operatorname{Gal}(E/F)$ to a subgroup of $S_n$ , whose order divides $|S_n|$ and therefore $\left|\operatorname{Gal}(E/F)\right|$ divides $n!$ , completing the proof.

Furthermore, decide whether $G \cong \mathbb{Z}$ . To show that $G$ is a group, we note that matrix multiplication is associative. The identity matrix $I_{2 \times 2}$ takes the role of the identity element in G. Since $\det(A) = 1 \neq 0$ we know that each element $A \in G$ has an inverse $A^{-1} \in G$ which can be computed by the formula $A^{-1} = \dfrac{1}{\det(A)} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} d & -b  \\ -c & a  \end{pmatrix}$ for any $2 \times 2$ matrix $A = \begin{pmatrix} a & b  \\ c & d  \end{pmatrix}$ .

Define the map $\phi : \mathbb{Z} \to G$ by $$ \phi(n) = \begin{pmatrix} 1 - 2n  & n  \\ -4n & 1  + 2n \end{pmatrix}. $$ First, we show that $\phi$ is a homomorphism.

Next, we show that $\phi$ is bijective. To see that $\phi$ is injective, let $\phi(n) = \phi(n')$ . Hence, \begin{equation*} \begin{pmatrix} 1 - 2n  & n  \\ -4n & 1  + 2n \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 - 2n'  & n'  \\ -4n' & 1  + 2n' \end{pmatrix}, \end{equation*} if and only if \begin{equation*} \begin{split} 1 - 2n = 1 - 2n' \quad & \iff \quad n = n' \\ n = n' \quad & \iff \quad n = n' \\ -4n = -4n' \quad & \iff \quad n = n' \\ 1 + 2n = 1 + 2n' \quad & \iff \quad n = n'. \end{split} \end{equation*} Thus, $\phi$ is injective.

Theorem: Suppose $H$ and $K$ are subgroups of the group $G$ such that $K \leq H \leq G$ and suppose that $(H:K)$ and $(G:H)$ are finite.  Then $(G:K)$ is finite and $(G:K) = (G:H) (H:K)$. Proof: First, define $\{a_iH | i = 1, 2, \cdots, r\}$ and $\{b_jK | j = 1, 2, \cdots s\}$ to be the collection of distinct left cosets of H in G and K in H, respectively.

Therefore, as all are distinct and $\cup_{i=1}^r\cup_{j=1}^s a_ib_jK = G$, we see that $S = \{a_ib_jK | i=1,2,\cdots, r; j=1,2,\cdots, s\}$ is the collection of distinct left cosets of $K$ in $G$ and $(G:K) = |S|$ where $|S| = rs = (G:H)(H:K)$.

Now note that $a +_{G^n} b^{-1} = (a_1 + b_1^{-1}, ..., a_n + b_n^{-1})$ and observe that since $a, b^{-1} \in K$ we have $a_1 + ... + a_n = e$ and $b_1^{-1} + ... + b_n^{-1} = e$.

Now without abelianness of $(G, +)$ we can't commute elements in the summation $a_1 + b_1^{-1} + ... + a_n + b_n^{-1}$ and thus we can't conclude that $a_1 + b_1^{-1} + ... + a_n + b_n^{-1} = e$ and therefore $a +_{G^n} b^{-1} \not\in K$. But since $K$ is a subgroup we reach a contradiction since $a +_{G^n} b^{-1} \in K$. $\square$ Is the above proof correct and rigorous? Is there any way I can make the reverse direction more rigorous?",,"['abstract-algebra', 'group-theory', 'proof-verification']"

I am trying to classify all groups of order 75. I am only allowed to use Sylow's theorems, and other basic facts (such as what groups of order $p^2$, $2p$ are isomorphic to, basic facts about direct products, etc). My attempt was the following: We have that $75 = 3 \cdot 5^2$. Sylow's third theorem tells us that the number $n_5$ of Sylow $5$-subgroups is congruent to $1 \bmod 5$, and must divide $3$. Therefore $n_5 = 1$, so we must have a normal (by Sylow's second theorem) subgroup of order $5^2 = 25$. Similarly we get that $n_3$, the number of Sylow $3$-subgroups, is either $1$ or $25$. In the case that $n_3 = 1$ it isn't hard to show that that the group is isomorphic to either $\mathbb Z_{25} \times \mathbb Z_3 \simeq \mathbb Z_{75}$, or to $(\mathbb Z_5 \times \mathbb Z_5) \times \mathbb Z_3 \simeq \mathbb Z_5 \times \mathbb Z_{15}$.

Here is what I have done: Let $Y=\bigoplus_{\alpha\in A}X_\alpha$ and for $\alpha\in A$ we define $f_\alpha:X_\alpha\to Y$ by $f_\alpha(x_\alpha)=(f^\beta_\alpha(x_\alpha))_{\beta\in A}$ where $f^\beta_\alpha(x_\alpha)=e_{\beta}$ (where $e_\beta$ is the neutral element of $X_\beta$ ) if $\beta\neq\alpha$ and $f^\beta_\alpha(x_\alpha)=x_\alpha$ if $\beta=\alpha$ for $x_\alpha\in X_\alpha$ . We see that $\{f_\alpha\}_{\alpha\in A}$ is a family of homomorphisms, so by hypothesis there exists a unique homomorphism $f:X\to Y$ with $f\circ i_\alpha=f_\alpha$ for all $\alpha\in A$ . So we try to show that $f$ is an isomorphism. Surjectivity: Let $(x_\alpha)_{\alpha\in A}\in \bigoplus_{\alpha\in A}X_\alpha$ with $x_\alpha\ne e_\alpha$ if and only if $\alpha\in\{\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_r\}$ for an $r\in\mathbb{N}_0$ . Now consider $x=i_{\alpha_1}(x_{\alpha_1})\cdot\ldots\cdot i_{\alpha_r}(x_{\alpha_r})$ ; we see that $f(x)=f\left(i_{\alpha_1}(x_{\alpha_1})\cdot\ldots\cdot i_{\alpha_r}(x_{\alpha_r})\right)=f\left(i_{\alpha_1}(x_{\alpha_1})\right)\cdot\ldots\cdot f\left(i_{\alpha_r}(x_{\alpha_r})\right)=f_{\alpha_1}(x_{\alpha_1})\cdot\ldots\cdot f_{\alpha_r}(x_{\alpha_r})=(x_\alpha)_{\alpha\in A}$ . Thus $f$ is surjective. Injectivity: Equivalently we try to show that $\ker f=\{e_X\}$ . We see that if $x\in\langle i_\alpha(X_\alpha)\ \mid\ \alpha\in A\rangle$ then $f(x)=e_X\implies x=e_X$ . However, I fail to see how to argue if $x\notin\langle i_\alpha(X_\alpha)\ \mid\ \alpha\in A\rangle$ . I think it has something to do with the uniqueness of the homomorphism $f \colon X\to Y$ , as so far I haven't used this property. Am I on the right track? Is what I have done so far correct? How to prove the injectivity? Thanks.","Let be a collection of groups and let be a group such that for all there exists an injection .
