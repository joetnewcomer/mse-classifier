0,Integral $\int_0^1 \frac{2x-1}{1+x-x^2}\left(4\ln x\ln(1+x)-\ln^2(1+x)\right)dx$,Integral,\int_0^1 \frac{2x-1}{1+x-x^2}\left(4\ln x\ln(1+x)-\ln^2(1+x)\right)dx,"The following problem was posted earlier this year by Cornel Ioan Valean: Prove that $$I=\int_0^1 \frac{2x-1}{1+x-x^2}\left(4\ln x\ln(1+x)-\ln^2(1+x)\right)dx=\frac{127}{20}\zeta(3)-\frac{8\pi^2}{5}\ln(\varphi)$$ My idea was to consider the following integral: $$\mathcal J(a)=\int_0^1 \frac{2x-1}{1+x-x^2}\ln(a+x)\ln(1+x)dx$$ So $I=4\mathcal J(0)-\mathcal J(1)$ . In order to evaluate $\mathcal J(a)$ I tried to apply Feynman's trick: $$\mathcal J'(a)=\int_0^1 \frac{\ln(1+x)}{a+x}\frac{dx}{\varphi-x}-\int_0^1 \frac{\ln(1+x)}{a+x}\frac{dx}{\frac{1}{\varphi}+x},\quad \varphi=\frac{1+\sqrt 5}{2}$$ $$\small =\frac{1}{a+\varphi}\int_0^1 \frac{\ln(1+x)}{a+x}dx+\frac{1}{a+\varphi}\int_0^1 \frac{\ln(1+x)}{\varphi-x}dx+\frac{1}{a-\frac{1}{\varphi}}\int_0^1 \frac{\ln(1+x)}{a+x}dx-\frac{1}{a-\frac{1}{\varphi}}\int_0^1 \frac{\ln(1+x)}{\frac{1}{\varphi}+x}dx$$ But I gave up on this idea after I realised that: $$\int_0^1 \frac{\ln(1+x)}{t+x}dx=\ln 2\ln \left(\frac{t+1}{t-1}\right)+\operatorname{Li}_2\left(\frac{2}{1-t}\right)-\operatorname{Li}_2\left(\frac{1}{1-t}\right)$$ Where $\operatorname{Li}_2(x)$ is the Dilogarithm. Other methods weren't promising either, such as the substitution $x=\frac{1-t}{1+t}$ , to combine the integral with it's sister one that has the denominator $1-x+x^2$ , or to integrate by parts which gives: $$\small 2I=2\int_0^1 \frac{\ln(1+x-x^2)\ln x}{1+x}dx+2\int_0^1 \frac{\ln(1+x-x^2)\ln(1+x)}{x}dx-\int_0^1 \frac{\ln(1+x-x^2)\ln (1+x)}{1+x}dx$$ I believe that the factor of $4$ plays a big role into obtain nicely this result and one shouldn't split the integral into two parts, but I had no success and I would appreciate some help.","The following problem was posted earlier this year by Cornel Ioan Valean: Prove that My idea was to consider the following integral: So .

1,"If $\Phi\geq 0$ is non-decreasing, does $\int_1^\infty \frac{\Phi(x)}{x^2}\,dx=\infty$ imply $\int_0^\infty e^{-\Phi(x)}\,dx<\infty$?","If  is non-decreasing, does  imply ?","\Phi\geq 0 \int_1^\infty \frac{\Phi(x)}{x^2}\,dx=\infty \int_0^\infty e^{-\Phi(x)}\,dx<\infty","Q. Suppose $\Phi : [0, \infty) \to [0, \infty)$ is a non-decreasing function. If $$ \int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{\Phi(x)}{x^2} \, \mathrm{d}x = \infty, $$ then does the inequality $$ \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-\Phi(x)} \, \mathrm{d}x < \infty $$ hold? This question is motivated by this posting , but it became a statement of independent interest to me. I suspect that the statement is true, based on a naive observation that a higher growth rate of $\Phi$ is in favor of both conditions and a slower growth rate is against them. One obvious observation is that $\Phi(x)$ must tend to $\infty$ as $x \to \infty$ . But, to be honest, I have no clue as to where I should start. So I would like to invite you to this strange yet interesting problem! Edit. The user @Sungjin Kim showed that the answer is false by providing a family of counter-examples. Here is a simplification of his answer: For each strictly increasing sequence $(b_k)_{k=1}^{\infty}$ in $[1, \infty)$ , let $$ \Phi(t) = \sum_{k \mathop{:} b_k \leq t} b_k = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} b_k \mathbf{1}_{[b_k, \infty)}(t). $$ Then it follows that $$ \int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{\Phi(t)}{t^2} \, \mathrm{d}t = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} b_k \int_{b_k}^{\infty} \frac{\mathrm{d}t}{t^2} = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} 1 = \infty. $$ On the other hand, since $\Phi(t) = \sum_{l=1}^{k} b_l$ for each $t \in [b_k, b_{k+1})$ , \begin{align*} \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-\Phi(t)} \, \mathrm{d}t \geq \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \int_{b_k}^{b_{k+1}} e^{-\Phi(t)} \, \mathrm{d}t = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (b_{k+1} - b_k) e^{-\sum_{l=1}^{k} b_l}. \end{align*} So by choosing $(b_{k+1})$ so that it satisfies $(b_{k+1} - b_k) e^{-\sum_{l=1}^{k} b_l} \geq 1$ for each $k$ , we have $$ \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-\Phi(t)} \, \mathrm{d}t = \infty. $$","Q.

14,Derivative and calculus over sets such as the rational numbers,Derivative and calculus over sets such as the rational numbers,,"I am interested in the derivative of a function defined on a subset $S$ of $[0, 1]$ . The subset in question is dense in $[0, 1]$ but has Lebesgue measure zero. My actual question can be found at the bottom of this post. There has been a few questions on the subject, but none leading to something interesting as far as I am concerned. See here , here (concept of arithmetic derivative) and also here (Minkowski's question mark function, related to the material discussed here.) Generally these discussions lead to some kind of non-sense math. Here it is the opposite. I have a framework that does work as far as applications and computations are concerned, but I have a hard time putting it into some sound mathematical framework. It would have to be some kind of non-standard calculus. Perhaps the simplest example (though I have plenty of other similar cases) is as follows. Let $Z$ be a random variable defined as follows: $$Z = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{X_k}{2^k}$$ where the $X_k$ 's are identically and independently distributed with a Bernouilli $(p)$ distribution. Thus $P(X_k = 1) = p$ and $P(X_k = 0) = 1-p$ . Here $0 < p < 1$ . In short, the $X_k$ 's are the binary digits of the random number $Z$ . There are two cases. Case $p=\frac{1}{2}$ In this case, $Z$ has a uniform distribution on $S$ , where $S$ is the set of normal numbers in $[0, 1]$ . It is known that $S$ has Lebesgue measure $1$ , and that $S$ is dense in $[0, 1]$ . Yet it is full of holes (no rational number is is a normal number due to their periodicity, thus the $X_k$ 's are not independent for rational numbers.) This is the simplest case. One might wonder if the density $f_Z$ (the derivative of the distribution $F_Z$ ) exists. Yet $f_Z(z) = 1$ if $z \in S$ works perfectly well for all purposes. It can easily be extended to $f_Z(z) = 1$ if $z \in [0, 1]$ . Let us denote the extended function as $\tilde{f}_Z$ . You can compute all the moments using the extended $\tilde{f}_Z$ and get the right answer. If $s$ is a positive real number, then $$E(Z^s) = \int_0^1 z^s \tilde{f}_Z(z) dz = \frac{1}{s+1}.$$ You could argue that $\tilde{f}_Z$ (and thus $f_Z$ ) can be obtained by inverting the above functional equation, using some kind of Laplace transform. So we can bypass the concept of derivative entirely, it seems. Case $p\neq \frac{1}{2}$ Now we are dealing with a hard nut to crack, and a wildly chaotic system: $Z$ 's support domain is a set $S'$ that is a subset of non-normal numbers in $[0, 1]$ . This set $S'$ has now Lebesgue measure zero, yet it is dense in $[0, 1]$ . For the distribution, it is not a problem: even discrete random variables have a distribution $F_Z$ defined for all positive real numbers: $F_Z(z) = P(Z \leq z)$ . The issue is with the density $f_Z = dF_Z/dz$ . It sounds either it should be zero everywhere or not exist. My guess is that you might be able to define a new, workable concept of density. In the neighborhood of every point $z \in S'$ , it looks like $g(z,h) = (F_Z(z+h) - F_Z(z))/h$ oscillates infinitely many times with no limit as $h\rightarrow 0$ , yet these oscillations are bounded most of the time, perhaps leading to the fact that averaging $g(z, h)$ around $h = 0$ , using smaller and smaller values of $h$ , could provide a sound definition for the density $f_Z$ . Again, despite the chaotic nature of the system (see how the the would-be density could potentially look like in the picture below) all the following quantities exist and can be computed exactly and then confirmed by empirical evidence, even though the integrals below may not make sense: $$E(Z) = \int_{0}^{1} z f_Z(z) dz = p \\ E(Z^2) = \int_{0}^{1} z^2 f_Z(z) dz =\frac{p}{3}(1+2p)\\ E(Z^3) = \int_{0}^{1} z^3 f_Z(z) dz =\frac{p}{7}(1+4p+2p^2)\\ E(Z^4) = \int_{0}^{1} z^4 f_Z(z) dz =\frac{p}{105}(7+46p + 44p^2+8p^3) $$ Indeed, a general formula for $E(Z^s) = \int_0^1 z^s f_Z(z)dz$ is available for $s \geq 0$ , defined by the following functional equation (see here ): $$E(Z^s) = \frac{p}{2^s-1+p}\cdot E((1+Z)^s) .$$ In other words, we would have, under some appropriate calculus theory with a sound definition of integral and derivative: $$\int_{S'}z^s f_Z(z)dz  = \frac{p}{2^s-1+p}\cdot\int_{S'}(1+z)^s f_Z(z) dz .$$ Here is how the density $f_Z$ , if properly defined, could look like for $p=0.75$ (see here and here ): Below is the empirical percentile distribution, for this particular $Z$ : Other related problems If instead, we consider the model $Z = X_1 + X_1 X_2 + X_1 X_2 X_3 + \cdots$ with $X$ Bernouilli $(p)$ , then $Z$ has a geometric distribution of parameter $1-p$ , see section 2.2 in this article . This system is also equivalent to the binary numeration system discussed so far: see section 5 in the same article. It results in $Z$ having a standard, well-known discrete distribution. But if this time $P(X=-0.5) = 0.5 = P(X=0.5)$ then $Z$ is uniform on a subset $S$ of $[-1, 1]$ , with $S$ also full of holes. Here is another interesting model: $$Z=\sqrt{X_1+\sqrt{X_2+\sqrt{X_3+\cdots}}}$$ The distribution for $X$ is as follows: $$P(X=0) = \frac{1}{2}, P(X=1) = \frac{1}{1 + \sqrt{5}}, P(X=2) = \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{4} \mbox{ } (\star)$$ This corresponds to a different numeration system, and the choice for $X$ 's distribution is not arbitrary, see here : in short, it makes the system smoother and possibly easier to solve. To the contrary $P(X=0) = P(X=1)=$ $P(X=2)= \frac{1}{3}$ yields a far more chaotic system, and the case $P(X=0) =$ $P(X=1) = \frac{1}{2}$ is so wild that the support domain of $Z$ has huge gaps, very visible to the naked eye. Normal numbers in the nested square root system are very different from normal numbers in the binary numeration system. The successive digits have a very specific auto-correlation structure, and the digits $0, 1, 2$ are not evenly distributed for normal numbers in that system. It is clear that if we assume that the $X_k$ 's are i.i.d, then $Z$ is not a normal number in that system. Yet we get a very good approximation for $F_Z$ , much smoother (at least visually) than in the binary numeration system investigated earlier, with $p\neq \frac{1}{2}$ . In particular, $F_Z$ is very well approximated by a log function, see chart below. Here the blue line is the empirical distribution for $Z$ , the red line is the log approximation. And below is a spectacular chart, featuring the approximation error $\epsilon(z) = F_Z(z) -\log_2(z)$ . It's a fractal! (source: see section 2.2 in this article ). In short, it is no more differentiable than a Brownian motion, and technically, the derivative $f_Z$ does not exist. Yet all moments of $Z$ can be computed exactly from the functional equation attached to that system ( $F_{Z^2}=F_{X+Z}$ ) and confirmed empirically. Even though the distribution looks smooth to the naked eye, we are dealing here with a very chaotic system in disguise. Again we need non-standard calculus to handle the density, whose support is a dense set of Lebesgue measure zero in $[1, 2]$ . Since fractals are nowhere differentiable, $f_Z$ does not exist. Yet one could imagine a ""density"" that would look like $f_Z(z)=\frac{1}{z\log 2}$ for $z\in [1,2]$ . My question Is there an existing theory to handle this type of density-like-substance?

When integrating over a subset of the form $A \times A^\text{c}$ with Lebesgue measurable $A \subset [0,1]$ (and $A^\text{c} = [0,1] \setminus A$ ), however, the result is generally finite. I would like to know whether this is true for every $A$ . My thoughts so far: For the simple interval $A = [0,1/2]$ the integral has the finite value $\log(2)$ . The integrand is only singular near the point $(1/2,1/2)$ , which is not enough to make the two-dimensional integral diverge. The same is true if $A$ is a union of finitely many intervals. Therefore, in order to make the integral large we need 'a lot' of points $(x,y) \in A \times A^\text{c}$ for which $\lvert x - y \rvert$ is small. This can be achieved by choosing $A = [0,1] \cap \mathbb{Q}$ , but of course the integral is simply zero  in this case because $A \times A^\text{c}$ is a Lebesgue null set. Thus we also need to ensure that both $A$ and $A^\text{c}$ have positive measure. We can let $A$ be the fat Cantor set to fulfil both requirements: $A$ and $A^\text{c}$ have Lebesgue measure $\frac{1}{2}$ each and there is an infinite number of points on the diagonal of $[0,1]^2$ near which the integrand diverges. I have tried to show that the integral is finite/infinite using the sequence of simpler sets defined in the iterative construction of $A$ , but the corresponding integrals become complicated rather fast and it seems like I am stuck at this point.

18,"A rigorous meaning of ""induced measure""?","A rigorous meaning of ""induced measure""?",,"In my readings I often come across terms like ""induced measure"" or ""induced Lebesgue measure"".

Sure, in the above example, we understand how to parametrize the $n$ ball, $\mathbb{B}^n$, and the $n-1$ sphere, $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$, and so the integrals are easy to compute and not very confusing. Sometimes, however, it appears in the context of a general hypersurface in $\mathbb{R}^n$ (say $\Sigma$, with integrals involving $d\Sigma$), or when integrating over a subset (submanifold) of some higher-dimensional  space. In a completely general setting like this, I am at a little bit of a loss when it comes to understanding  how these separate ""surface"" measures or ""induced"" measures are really defined, when I'm lacking an explicit parametrization. It also doesn't help that traditional vector calculus classes seem to always fall short of doing anything past 3 dimensions. For example, I've never seen a class teach its students how to carry out a (2-D) surface integral in anything except $\mathbb{R}^3$; so they would have no idea how to go about finding the surface area of, say a Clifford Torus in $\mathbb{R}^4$. And in general, I've never seen them address a general technique for integrating over an $n$-dimensional body, embedded in $n<m$-dimensional space. It seems like everything they're taught is in terms of the cross product, which fails to be of any use in $\mathbb{R}^{n>3}$. Now I realize that at least some of the hypersurface examples from calculus, that I've mentioned above, can be addressed using the generalized Stokes' theorem: $\int_{D}\text{d}\omega = \int_{\partial D}\omega$. But it seems to me that when we are getting to the realm of measure theory, higher-level analysis, and Riemannian geometry, the word ""induced"" is probably thrown around for a good reason. Let me clarify what I mean: If we are on a Riemannian manifold $M$, then its metric $g$ defines a volume element for the the manifold, $dV_g = \sqrt{\det g}\;dV$, where $dV$ is the Euclidean measure for your coordinate patch in $\mathbb{R}^n$. If we then consider an immersed submanifold $N\hookrightarrow M$, we have a rigourous definition for the induced metric that $N$ inherits from $M$. If we have a topological space $(X,\tau)$, then it induces a subspace topology on any subset $Y\subset X$, $\tau_Y = \{Y\cap U : U\in\tau\}$. Similarly for any subset $Y\subset X$ of a $\sigma$-algebra $(X,\Sigma)$, we have the sub-$\sigma$-algebra $(Y,\Sigma_Y), \Sigma_Y = \{Y\cap A : A\in\Sigma\}$. In these settings, the word "" induced "" has a very specific meaning, and essentially boils down to the idea of a subset inheriting some sort of property from a larger set it belongs to. So it would make sense that there should be some concrete way of having a measure space induce some kind of measure on a subset of itself. At first glance, since a measure space $(X,\Sigma,\mu)$ can give rise to a sub-$\sigma$-algebra (as mentioned above) then you might want to simply take the restriction of $\mu$ to these subsets in $\Sigma_Y$. But the problem is that any subset $E$, without full dimension, will of course have measure zero, $\mu(E)=0$. So this would make for a lousy way to define integration over this subset. So maybe we only concern ourselves with Riemannian manifolds, and just define the induced measure as the one that arrises from the induced metric of some parent manifold. But this seems limiting for a couple reasons: Integration is now limited to Riemannian manifolds, and no longer over a general measure space. For example, while integration with respect to the counting measure makes sense over $\mathbb{N}$, I can't see any way to interpret this as integration over a Riemannian manifold; and so the question of how the counting measure ""induces"" another measure would be meaningless. If we consider a (smooth) subset $S\subset\mathbb{R}^n$, we can build a measure space on $S$ from scratch, similar to how we build the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$ in measure theory. My question then is: are we always able to realize integration (with respect to this measure) over $S$ as integration with respect to some induced metric, by considering $S\subset M$, for some manifold $(M,g)$? To me, a measure (and anything that it induces) should be in the spirit of measurable sets, and not be restricted to differential manifolds. The Lebesgue measure $\mu$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ gives us the volume of the unit ball as $\frac{4}{3}\pi$; shouldn't $\mu$ induce a measure on $\mathbb{S}^2$, to give us $4\pi$ surface area?

A similar integral has a simple closed form: $$\int_0^{\infty } \frac{1+z^2}{1+z^4} z^p \, dz=\frac{\pi}{4}   \left(\csc \left(\frac{\pi}{4}   (p+1)\right)+\sec \left(\frac{\pi}{4}  (p+1)\right)\right)$$ This strongly hints on the Beta function, however the series expansion of the original integral will not work, beacuse the limits will be either $\int_0^1$ or $\int_1^\infty$, thus even the series of trigonometric functions doesn't seem possible here. Mathematica gives: $$\int_0^1 \frac{1+z^2}{1+z^4} z^p \, dz=\frac{1}{8} \left(\psi \left(\frac{p+5}{8}\right)+\psi\left(\frac{p+7}{8}\right)-\psi\left(\frac{p+1}{8}\right)-\psi \left(\frac{p+3}{8}\right)\right)$$ Is a closed form possible for $I(p)$ for general $p$, not represented as an infinite series of polygamma functions, but something nicer? Maybe contour integration can help here? As a separate question, could it be possible to find an ODE for $I(p)$ as a function? It would be almost as good as a closed form to me. The motivation is this question . An asymptotic series for $p \to 0$ (obtained by integration of the Taylor series by term) starts as: $$I(p) \approx \frac{\pi}{2 \sqrt{2}} \left( 1-\frac{3 \pi ^2 p^2}{32}+\frac{95 \pi ^4 p^4}{2048}-\frac{18727 \pi ^6 p^6}{327680}+\frac{23151383 \pi ^8 p^8}{176160768}-\dots \right)=$$ $$=\sum_{n=0}^m (-1)^n \frac{A000364(n) A000281(n)}{(2n)!} \frac{\pi^{2n}}{4^{2n}}p^{2n}$$ The numerator is a product of A000364 and A000281 . However, this series does not converge - the numerator grows faster than the denominator for all $p$ as far as I can see. Update: Thanks to this great answer we can state the following: $$I(p)=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{p}I \left( \frac{2}{p} \right)$$ From this functional equation we can see that $p=\sqrt{2}$ is a special value.","Is there a closed form for: $$I(p)=\int_0^\infty \frac{1+z^2}{1+z^4} \frac{z^p}{1+z^{2p}} dz$$ The integral has a number of nice properties: $$I(p)=I(-p)$$ $$I(p)=2\int_0^1 \frac{1+z^2}{1+z^4} \frac{z^p}{1+z^{2p}} dz=2\int_1^\infty \frac{1+z^2}{1+z^4} \frac{z^p}{1+z^{2p}} dz$$ $$I(p)=\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{\cosh y}{\cosh 2y} \frac{dy}{\cosh p y}$$ I'm pretty sure it has a closed form expression for every rational $p$, because then we will be able to get a rational function under the integral either directly or with a simple substitution. Some examples of closed form expressions: $$I(0)=\frac{\pi}{2 \sqrt{2}}$$ $$I(1)=\frac{\pi}{4}$$ $$I(2)=\frac{\pi}{4 \sqrt{2}}$$ $$I(3)=\left(\frac{2}{3 \sqrt{3}}-\frac{1}{4} \right)\pi$$ $$I(4)=\left(\sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \left(1+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)}-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)\frac{\pi}{2}$$ $$I(5)=\left(\frac{\sqrt{10(5+\sqrt{5})}}{25}-\frac{1}{4} \right)\pi$$ $$I \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)=\left(\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}-1 \right)\pi$$ $$I \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)=\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}-\frac{1}{4} \right)\pi$$ $$I \left( \frac{1}{4} \right)=\left(2-\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2-\sqrt{2}}}\right)\pi$$ $$I \left( \frac{1}{5} \right)=\left(\frac{2\sqrt{5}-1}{4}-\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2-\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}}\right)\pi$$ Some not very nice closed forms also appear: $$I \left( \frac{2}{7} \right)=\frac{ \pi}{8}  \left(7 \sqrt{2}+ 4 \sin ^3\left(\frac{\pi }{14}\right) \sin \left(\frac{3 \pi }{14}\right) \csc ^6\left(\frac{\pi }{7}\right) \times \\ \times \left(48 \sin ^2\left(\frac{\pi }{14}\right) \sin \left(\frac{5 \pi }{28}\right) \sin ^2\left(\frac{3 \pi }{14}\right)-4 \sin \left(\frac{\pi }{28}\right) \sin \left(\frac{3 \pi }{14}\right)+\sin \left(\frac{\pi }{14}\right) \times \\ \times \left(2 \sin \left(\frac{3 \pi }{28}\right)-\sin \left(\frac{3 \pi }{14}\right) \left(2 \csc \left(\frac{\pi }{28}\right)+\csc \left(\frac{3 \pi }{28}\right)-3 \csc \left(\frac{5 \pi }{28}\right)\right)\right)\right)\right)$$ Because we can only consider the case $z<1$ a series solution is possible, but the series contain the polygamma function and it's not very useful. A similar integral has a simple closed form: $$\int_0^{\infty } \frac{1+z^2}{1+z^4} z^p \, dz=\frac{\pi}{4}   \left(\csc \left(\frac{\pi}{4}   (p+1)\right)+\sec \left(\frac{\pi}{4}  (p+1)\right)\right)$$ This strongly hints on the Beta function, however the series expansion of the original integral will not work, beacuse the limits will be either $\int_0^1$ or $\int_1^\infty$, thus even the series of trigonometric functions doesn't seem possible here. Mathematica gives: $$\int_0^1 \frac{1+z^2}{1+z^4} z^p \, dz=\frac{1}{8} \left(\psi \left(\frac{p+5}{8}\right)+\psi\left(\frac{p+7}{8}\right)-\psi\left(\frac{p+1}{8}\right)-\psi \left(\frac{p+3}{8}\right)\right)$$ Is a closed form possible for $I(p)$ for general $p$, not represented as an infinite series of polygamma functions, but something nicer? Maybe contour integration can help here? As a separate question, could it be possible to find an ODE for $I(p)$ as a function? It would be almost as good as a closed form to me. The motivation is this question . An asymptotic series for $p \to 0$ (obtained by integration of the Taylor series by term) starts as: $$I(p) \approx \frac{\pi}{2 \sqrt{2}} \left( 1-\frac{3 \pi ^2 p^2}{32}+\frac{95 \pi ^4 p^4}{2048}-\frac{18727 \pi ^6 p^6}{327680}+\frac{23151383 \pi ^8 p^8}{176160768}-\dots \right)=$$ $$=\sum_{n=0}^m (-1)^n \frac{A000364(n) A000281(n)}{(2n)!} \frac{\pi^{2n}}{4^{2n}}p^{2n}$$ The numerator is a product of A000364 and A000281 . However, this series does not converge - the numerator grows faster than the denominator for all $p$ as far as I can see.

Surprisingly the result is quite nice and an approach can be  found here . $$\boxed{\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2} x^2\sqrt{\tan x}\,\mathrm dx=\frac{\sqrt{2}\pi(5\pi^2+12\pi\ln 2 - 12\ln^22)}{96}}$$ Although the approach there is quite skillful, I believed that an elementary approach can be found for this integral. Here is my idea. First we will consider the following two integrals: $$I=\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2} x^2\sqrt{\tan x}\,\mathrm dx \,;\quad J=\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2} x^2\sqrt{\cot x}\,\mathrm dx$$ $$\Rightarrow I=\frac12 \left((I-J)+(I+J)\right)$$ Thust we need to evaluate the sum and the difference of those two from above.

Of course using $(1)$ we can again  deduce that: $$\bbox[10pt,#000, border:2px solid green ]{\color{red}{\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2} x \arcsin \left(\sin x-\cos x\right)dx=\frac{\pi^3}{96}+\frac{\pi}{8}\ln^2 2}}$$ In the meantime I found  a way for the first one, mainly using: $$\frac{\arctan x}{x}=\int_0^1 \frac{dy}{1+x^2y^2}$$ Let us denote: $$I_1=\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2} \operatorname{arccosh} (\sin x+\cos x)dx\overset{IBP}= \int_0^\frac{\pi}{2} x \cdot \frac{\sin x-\cos x}{\sqrt{\sin(2x)}}dx$$ $$\overset{\tan x\rightarrow x}=\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}\int_0^\infty \frac{\arctan x}{1+x^2}\frac{x-1}{\sqrt x}dx=\frac1{\sqrt 2}\int_0^\infty \int_0^1 \frac{dy}{1+x^2y^2} \frac{\sqrt x(x-1)}{1+x^2}dx$$ $$=\frac1{\sqrt 2}\int_0^1 \int_0^\infty \frac{1}{1+y^2x^2} \frac{\sqrt x(x-1)}{1+x^2} dxdy$$ $$=\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}\int_0^1 \frac{{\pi}}{\sqrt 2}\left(\frac{2}{y^2-1}-\frac{1}{\sqrt y (y^2-1)}-\frac{\sqrt y}{y^2-1}\right)dy=\frac{\pi}{2}\ln 2$$ Although the integral in the third row looks quite unpleasant, it can be done quite elementary.

It is even known to enjoy an occasional technical advantage over the Lebesgue theory; for instance, one must invent the theory of distributions to make sense of the Cauchy principal value of an improper integral in the Lebesgue theory if I recall correctly. this can be seen here. My point is: the fundamental theorems of calculus (as stated in calculus) can be demonstrated without ever touching the concept of riemann-integration. We, thus, have the so-asked tool of calculation without ever having to appeal to the riemann-integral theory. I illustrate my claim: [First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus] Let $f:[a,b]\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be an integrable function. Then: $$F(x):= \int_{[a,x]} f d\mu $$ is continuous in $[a,b]$. Furthermore, if $f$ is continuous at $x_0 \in (a,b)$, then $F$ is differentiable at $x_0$, and $$F'(x_0)=f(x_0)$$ Proof: To prove continuity, fix $x_0 \in [a,b]$. Take a sequence $x_n$ that converges to $x_0$. We will prove $F(x_n) \rightarrow F(x_0)$ $F(x_n)=\int_{[a,x_n]} f d\mu=\int_{[a,b]}f \chi_{[a,x_n]} d\mu$ It is easy to see that $f \chi_{[a,x_n]} \rightarrow  f \chi_{[a,x_0]}$ pointwise. Therefore, since the sequence $f \chi_{[a,x_n]}$ is dominated by $|f|$, it follows by Lebesgue's Dominated Convergence Theorem that: $\lim F(x_n)=F(x_0)$ This proves continuity. For the second part, we must prove that $\lim_{x \rightarrow x_0}\frac{F(x)-F(x_0)}{x-x_0}=f(x_0)$. We will prove that the right-handed limit is $f(x_0)$, and the left-handed limit is analogous. Suppose $f$ is continuous at $x_0$. Take an arbitrary $\epsilon >0$. There exists a $\delta>0$ such that $|x-x_0| < \delta \implies f(x_0)-\epsilon<f(x)<f(x_0)+\epsilon$. Therefore, if $0<x-x_0 <\delta$, since $$\frac{F(x)-F(x_0)}{x-x_0}=\frac{\int_{[x_0,x]}f(x)}{x-x_0}$$ we have: $$ \frac{\int_{[x_0,x]}(f(x_0)-\epsilon)}{x-x_0}\leq \frac{\int_{[x_0,x]}f(x)}{x-x_0} \leq \frac{\int_{[x_0,x]}(f(x_0)+\epsilon)}{x-x_0} \implies$$ $$ f(x_0)-\epsilon\leq \frac{\int_{[x_0,x]}f(x)}{x-x_0} \leq f(x_0)+\epsilon$$ Therefore, taking any sequence $x_n \rightarrow x_0$ from the right. We have: $$ f(x_0)-\epsilon\leq \limsup \frac{\int_{[x_0,x_n]}f(x_n)}{x_n-x_0} \leq f(x_0)+\epsilon$$ $$ f(x_0)-\epsilon\leq \liminf \frac{\int_{[x_0,x_n]}f(x_n)}{x_n-x_0} \leq f(x_0)+\epsilon$$ Since $\epsilon >0$ is arbitrary: $\lim \frac{\int_{[x_0,x_n]}f(x_n)}{x_n-x_0}=f(x_0)$ This holds for every sequence $x_n \rightarrow x_0$ from the right. Then, $\lim_{x \rightarrow x_0^+}\frac{F(x)-F(x_0)}{x-x_0}=f(x_0)$.

Therefore: $$\displaystyle F(b)-F(a)=\sum_{k=1}^{2^n}F(x_k)-F(x_{k-1})=\sum_{k=1}^{2^n}f(t_k)(x-x_{k-1})$$ Now, define: $$\displaystyle f_n:=\sum_{k=1}^{2^n}f(t_k)\chi_{[x_{k-1},x_k]}$$ Doing this for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we arrive at a sequence $f_n$ of functions which converge pointwise to $f$, as is easily verified (Here we use continuity of $f$).

First of all, I applied the change of variables $\displaystyle y = \frac{2}{x^2}$ to get that $\displaystyle I = \frac{1}{4} \int_0^\infty \frac{\cos(\frac{y}{2})}{y^2 + 1}dy = \frac{1}{4} \Re \left( \int_0^\infty \frac{e^{iy/2}}{y^2 + 1}dy \right)$ which is a well known integral and is equal to $\displaystyle \frac{\pi}{2\sqrt e}$ . So $\displaystyle I = \frac{\pi}{8\sqrt e}$ . This is the correct result. (For those who don't know, the integral can be solved using Feynman's Trick or Jordan's Lemma with a suitable contour in the upper half plane.) Now, let's say that I want to solve the integral without making any change of variables or others tricks. I just want to solve it using the residue theorem with a quarter of circle of radius $\displaystyle R \to \infty$ and center $\displaystyle C = (0,0)$ in the first quadrant as a contour. Let's call this contour $\displaystyle \gamma$ . So I want to find $\displaystyle J =\oint_\gamma \frac{z\cos(\frac{1}{z^2})}{z^4 + 4}dz$ and how it is related to I. Let's find J. $\displaystyle J =\int_0^\infty \frac{z\cos(\frac{1}{z^2})}{z^4 + 4}dz + \int_{Arc} \frac{z\cos(\frac{1}{z^2})}{z^4 + 4}dz + \int_{i\infty}^{i0} \frac{z\cos(\frac{1}{z^2})}{z^4 + 4}dz$ , where Arc is parametrized by $\displaystyle z(\theta) = R e^{i\theta}$ for $\displaystyle \theta \in \left [0,\frac{\pi}{2} \right]$ . The first integral is obviously I and so is the third ( use the change of variables $\displaystyle z \to -iz$ ). Let's call the second integral $\displaystyle I_{Arc}$ . EDIT: After a comment I decided to work on the third piece: $\displaystyle Q = \int_{i\infty}^{i0} \frac{z\cos(\frac{1}{z^2})}{z^4 + 4}dz$ using the change of variables $\displaystyle q = -iz$ $\displaystyle Q = \int_{\infty}^{0} \frac{iq\cos\left(\frac{1}{(iq)^2}\right)}{(iq)^4 + 4}idq = -\int_{\infty}^{0} \frac{q\cos\left(\frac{-1}{q^2}\right)}{(iq)^4 + 4}dq = \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{q\cos\left(\frac{1}{q^2}\right)}{q^4 + 4}dq = I $ Now, I would like to show that $\displaystyle I_{Arc} \to 0$ as $\displaystyle R \to \infty$ . $\displaystyle \mid I_{Arc} \mid = \left| \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{R e^{i\theta} \cos\left(\frac{1}{R^2 e^{i2\theta}}\right)}{R^4 e^{i4\theta} + 4} R e^{i\theta} i d\theta \right| \leq \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \left|  \frac{R^2 \cos\left(\frac{1}{R^2 e^{i2\theta}}\right)}{R^4 e^{i4\theta} + 4} \right| d\theta \leq \frac{3R^2}{R^3} \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} d\theta = \frac{1}{R}\frac{3\pi}{2} \to 0$ as $\displaystyle R \to \infty$ Where I used: $\displaystyle \left| \cos\left(\frac{1}{R^2 e^{i2\theta}}\right) \right| =  \left| \frac{ \exp\left(\frac{i\cos(2\theta) + \sin(2\theta)}{R^2} \right) + \exp\left(\frac{-i\cos(2\theta) - \sin(2\theta)}{R^2} \right) }{2} \right| \leq \left| \frac{ \exp\left(\frac{\sin(2\theta)}{R^2} \right)}{2} \right| + \left| \frac{ \exp\left(\frac{-\sin(2\theta)}{R^2} \right)}{2} \right| \leq \exp\left(\frac{\sin(2\theta)}{R^2} \right) \leq 3$ since R is definitely bigger than 1. Also $\displaystyle \mid R^4e^{i4\theta} + 4 \mid = \sqrt{(R^4\cos4\theta + 4)^2 + R^4\sin^24\theta} = \sqrt{R^8 + 16 + 8R^4\cos4\theta} \ge \sqrt{R^8 + 8R^4\cos4\theta} \ge \sqrt{R^8 - 8R^4} \ge R^3$ . Which is true if $\displaystyle R >> 1$ . So I changed how I bounded $\displaystyle  \mid I_{Arc} \mid$ So, it stands to reason that $\displaystyle J = 2I$ and $\displaystyle J = 2\pi i \sum\operatorname{Res}(f,z_k)$ , but the only pole inside the region bounded by $\displaystyle \gamma $ is $\displaystyle z = 1 + i$ , so after some algebra, one can find that $\displaystyle J = \frac{\pi}{8}\cosh\frac{1}{2}$ . So, $\displaystyle I = \frac{\pi}{8} \left(\sqrt{e} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{e}} \right)$ . What I am doing wrong? (I know that I may have written too much, but please don't bash me too harshly, this is my first time writing a question). EDIT: For those who don't want to read the comments. $\displaystyle z = 0$ is an essential singularity, so as the singularity is on the contour I need to make a detour around $\displaystyle z = 0$ . For example I can use the path parametrized by $\displaystyle \sigma(\theta) = \epsilon e^{i\theta}$ for $\displaystyle \theta \in \left[0,\frac{\pi}{2}\right]$ and $\displaystyle \epsilon << 1$ which contributes to the value of $\displaystyle J$ . But, now the curve is oriented clock-wise. So, $\displaystyle J = 2I + $ this contribution. After I calculate this contribution I will edit the question again. Final EDIT ( I suppose ): Calculating this contribution is just like calculating manually $I_{Arc}$ but in the limit of $R \to 0$ , I also suppose that this is not analytically doable, I guess that a simple Monte Carlo Integration technique could help. Anyway, this contribution should make things work. The moral of the story is to trust in the power of analysis and to do things in a smart way just like I did in the first part of this question.","I want to use complex analysis to solve this integral: I'm having trouble because I get two different results with two different methods.

Which is true if . So I changed how I bounded So, it stands to reason that and , but the only pole inside the region bounded by is , so after some algebra, one can find that . So, . What I am doing wrong? (I know that I may have written too much, but please don't bash me too harshly, this is my first time writing a question). EDIT: For those who don't want to read the comments. is an essential singularity, so as the singularity is on the contour I need to make a detour around . For example I can use the path parametrized by for and which contributes to the value of . But, now the curve is oriented clock-wise. So, this contribution. After I calculate this contribution I will edit the question again. Final EDIT ( I suppose ): Calculating this contribution is just like calculating manually but in the limit of , I also suppose that this is not analytically doable, I guess that a simple Monte Carlo Integration technique could help. Anyway, this contribution should make things work. The moral of the story is to trust in the power of analysis and to do things in a smart way just like I did in the first part of this question."," I = \int_0^\infty \frac{x\cos\left(\frac{1}{x^2}\right)}{x^4 + 4}\,dx \displaystyle y = \frac{2}{x^2} \displaystyle I = \frac{1}{4} \int_0^\infty \frac{\cos(\frac{y}{2})}{y^2 + 1}dy = \frac{1}{4} \Re \left( \int_0^\infty \frac{e^{iy/2}}{y^2 + 1}dy \right) \displaystyle \frac{\pi}{2\sqrt e} \displaystyle I = \frac{\pi}{8\sqrt e} \displaystyle R \to \infty \displaystyle C = (0,0) \displaystyle \gamma \displaystyle J =\oint_\gamma \frac{z\cos(\frac{1}{z^2})}{z^4 + 4}dz \displaystyle J =\int_0^\infty \frac{z\cos(\frac{1}{z^2})}{z^4 + 4}dz + \int_{Arc} \frac{z\cos(\frac{1}{z^2})}{z^4 + 4}dz + \int_{i\infty}^{i0} \frac{z\cos(\frac{1}{z^2})}{z^4 + 4}dz \displaystyle z(\theta) = R e^{i\theta} \displaystyle \theta \in \left [0,\frac{\pi}{2} \right] \displaystyle z \to -iz \displaystyle I_{Arc} \displaystyle Q = \int_{i\infty}^{i0} \frac{z\cos(\frac{1}{z^2})}{z^4 + 4}dz \displaystyle q = -iz \displaystyle Q = \int_{\infty}^{0} \frac{iq\cos\left(\frac{1}{(iq)^2}\right)}{(iq)^4 + 4}idq = -\int_{\infty}^{0} \frac{q\cos\left(\frac{-1}{q^2}\right)}{(iq)^4 + 4}dq = \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{q\cos\left(\frac{1}{q^2}\right)}{q^4 + 4}dq = I  \displaystyle I_{Arc} \to 0 \displaystyle R \to \infty \displaystyle \mid I_{Arc} \mid = \left| \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{R e^{i\theta} \cos\left(\frac{1}{R^2 e^{i2\theta}}\right)}{R^4 e^{i4\theta} + 4} R e^{i\theta} i d\theta \right| \leq

The center of the ""cut out"" disk is at $R/2$ from the venter of the original disk. We have to find the center of mass of leftover body. I thought that we should set up a coordinate system with the center of original disk as the origin.

So, we need to worry only about the integral inside the circular region, even there by symmetry we know that $\vec{R}_{CM}$ will lie on the axis joining their centers (let's call the line joining all three centers as $x$ -axis and the line perpendicular to this line as $y$ -axis).

We   normalize the measure $dx$ such that $\int_{|x|_p \le 1} dx = 1.$   Under such agreement the measure is unique. For any compact $K \subseteq \mathbb Q_p$ the measure $dx$ defines a positive linear   continuous functional on $C(K)$ by the formula $\int_K f(x) dx$. A   function $f \in \mathcal L^1_{\textrm{loc}}$ is called integrable on   $\mathbb Q_p$ if there exists $$\lim_{N \to \infty} \int_{B(N)} f(x)dx = \lim_{N \to \infty} \sum_{\gamma = -N}^\infty \int_{S(-\gamma)} f(x) dx.$$ Their denote by $B(N)$ the set $\{x \in \mathbb Q_p : |x|_p \le p^N \}$ and $S(\gamma)$ is defined as $B(\gamma) \setminus B(\gamma-1)$. Next we have the famous Volkenborn integral, described as follows by Robert: We say that $f$ is strictly differentiable at a point $a \in X$ - and   denote this property by $f \in \mathcal S^1(a)$ - if the difference   quotients $[f(x) - f(y)]/(x-y)$ have a limit as $(x, y) \to (a,a)$   ($x$ and $y$ remaining distinct). By the way, $\mathcal S^1(X) := \bigcap_{a \in X} \mathcal S^1(a)$.   The Volkenborn integral of a function $f \in \mathcal S^1(\mathbb Z_p)$ is by definition $$\int_{\mathbb Z_p} f(x) dx = \lim_{n \to  \infty} \frac{1}{p^n} \sum_{j=0}^{p^n-1} f(j).$$ Finally a quote from Koblitz book ""$p$-adic numbers, analysis and $\zeta$-functions"": Now let $X$ be a compact-open subset of $\mathbb Q_p$. A $p$-adic distribution $\mu$ on $X$ is a $\mathbb Q_p$-linear vector space homomorphism from the $\mathbb Q_p$-vector space of locally constant functions on $X$ to $\mathbb Q_p$. Later he states that for $p$-adic measures (distributions that are bounded on compact-open subsets by some constant) and continuous functions $f$ there is a reasonable way to define $\mu(f) =: \int_X f \mu$. Cassels is confusing me even more as he mentions Shnirelman. So, here are my actual questions: Do these ultrametric integrals have real analogues like: being a limit of Riemannian sums or an operation inverse to differentiation? Are they compatible to each other? Is any of them a generalization of the others? What are the positive and negative attributes of the cited definitions? Where can I find an exhaustive table of integrals? I'm mainly interested in something similar to https://www.tug.org/texshowcase/cheat.pdf . Can we somehow imitate the Lebesgue integration theory?","Here are three (possibly different) definitions of $p$-adic integrals that I have encountered during my self-studies. First of all, here is what Vladimirov, Volovich and Zelenov write at the beginning of their book on mathematical physics: As the field $\mathbb Q_p$ is a locally compact commutative group with   respect to addition then in $\mathbb Q_p$ there exists the Haar   measure, a positive measure $dx$ which is invariant to shifts. We   normalize the measure $dx$ such that $\int_{|x|_p \le 1} dx = 1.$   Under such agreement the measure is unique. For any compact $K \subseteq \mathbb Q_p$ the measure $dx$ defines a positive linear   continuous functional on $C(K)$ by the formula $\int_K f(x) dx$.

99,Why does integral and the imaginary part commute?,Why does integral and the imaginary part commute?,,"I have many a times encountered (and used myself) the following technique: $$\int \sin x \mathrm{d}x = \int \operatorname{Im}(e^{ix}) \mathrm{d}x = \operatorname{Im} \left( \int e^{ix} \mathrm{d}x \right) = \operatorname{Im}( -ie^{ix}) + C = -\cos x + C$$ Not only in this case, but I've used this kind of transform many a times, instinctively, to solve many of those monster trig integrals (and it works like a miracle) but never justified it. Why and how is this interchange of integral and imaginary part justified? At first, I thought it might be always true that we can do such a type of interchange anywhere, so, I tried the following: $\operatorname{Im}(f(z)) = f(\operatorname{Im}(z))$. But this is clearly not true, as the LHS is always real but RHS can be, possibly, complex too. Second thoughts. I realized that we are dealing with operators here and not functions really. Both integral and imaginary parts are operators. So we have a composition of operators and we are willing to check when do these operators commute? I couldn't really make out any further conclusions from here and am stuck with the following questions: When and why is the following true: $\int \operatorname{Im}(f(z)) \mathrm{d}z= \operatorname{Im} \left( \int f(z) \mathrm{d}z \right)$? (Provided that $f$ is integrable) Is it always true? (Because like I've used it so many times and never found any counter example) Edit : I am unfamiliar with integration of complex-valued functions but what I have in mind is that while doing such a thing, I tend to think of $i$ as just as some constant (Ah! I hope this doesn't sounds like really weird), as I stated in the example in the beginning. To be more precise, I have something of like this in my mind: because a complex-valued function $f(z)$ can be thought of as $f(z) = f(x+iy) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y)$ where $u$ and $v$ are real-valued functions and we can now use our definition for integration of real-valued functions as $$\int f(z) \mathrm{d}z = \int (u(x,y) + iv(x,y)) \mathrm{d}(x+iy) = \left(\int u\mathrm{d}x - \int v\mathrm{d}y\right) +i\left(\int v\mathrm{d}x + \int u\mathrm{d}y\right)$$","I have many a times encountered (and used myself) the following technique: $$\int \sin x \mathrm{d}x = \int \operatorname{Im}(e^{ix}) \mathrm{d}x = \operatorname{Im} \left( \int e^{ix} \mathrm{d}x \right) = \operatorname{Im}( -ie^{ix}) + C = -\cos x + C$$ Not only in this case, but I've used this kind of transform many a times, instinctively, to solve many of those monster trig integrals (and it works like a miracle) but never justified it.
