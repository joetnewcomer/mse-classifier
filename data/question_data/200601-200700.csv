If $r+s\ge n$ then $V$ and $W$ have a non-empty intersection. The proof is by contradiction. If there is no intersection, then chose $\gamma$ connecting $V$ to $W$ and realized the distance between $V$ and $W$. Due to the dimension reason, he find a parallel vector fileld $X$ along $\gamma$, then apply the second variational formula. For the boundary term $g(\nabla_X X, \dot{\gamma})$. He claimed this is zero due to the totally geodesic property. My question is: In order to take covariant derivative $\nabla_v Y$, the vector field $Y$ has to be defined at least along one curve $\sigma$ with $\dot{\sigma}=v$, right?

If there is no intersection, then chose $\gamma$ connecting $V$ to $W$ and realized the distance between $V$ and $W$.

Firstly, let me outline the problem: Let $\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{x}(u,v)$ be a regular parametrized surface. A parallel surface to $\mathbf{x}$ is a parametrized surface $$\overline{\mathbf{y}}(u,v) = \mathbf{x}(u,v) + a \mathbf{N}(u,v),$$ where $a$ is a real constant and $\mathbf{N}$ denotes the unit normal to $\mathbf{x}$ . (b) Show that the Gaussian and mean curvatures $\overline{K}$ and $\overline{H}$ of $\mathbf{y}$ are respectively given by $$\overline{K} = \frac{K}{1 - 2Ha + Ka^2},$$ and $$\overline{H} = \frac{H - Ka}{1 - 2Ha + Ka^2}.$$ From question (a), we derived: $$\overline{\mathbf{y}}_u \times \overline{\mathbf{y}}_v = (1 - 2 H a + K a^2) (\mathbf{x}_u \times \mathbf{x}_v).$$ This implies that the unit normal $\overline{\mathbf{N}}$ to $\overline{\mathbf{y}}$ is given by $$\overline{\mathbf{N}} = \frac{\overline{\mathbf{y}}_u \times \overline{\mathbf{y}}_v}{||\overline{\mathbf{y}}_u \times \overline{\mathbf{y}}_v||} = \frac{1 - 2 H a + K a^2}{|1 - 2 H a + K a^2|} \frac{\mathbf{x}_u \times \mathbf{x}_v}{||\mathbf{x}_u \times \mathbf{x}_v||} = \text{sgn}(1 - 2 H a + K a^2) \mathbf{N}.$$ Thus, $\overline{\mathbf{N}}$ and $\mathbf{N}$ are parallel as expected. However, the term $\text{sgn}(1 - 2 H a + K a^2)$ suggests they may not always point in the same direction. My confusion arises from this sign, as other solutions I've reviewed do not include the sign function, which doesn't make sense to me. When I account for this term throughout my proof, I arrive at the given formula for $\overline{K}$ , which makes sense since Gaussian curvature is independent of orientation. However, for the mean curvature $\overline{H}$ , I derive: $$\overline{H} = \text{sgn}(1 - 2 H a + K a^2) \frac{H - Ka}{1 - 2Ha + Ka^2} = \frac{H - Ka}{|1 - 2Ha + Ka^2|}.$$ I am wondering if I've made an error in my reasoning. Note that in class we are using the convention where the ordering of the pair $(u,v)$ matters in defining the normal unit vector.

Assuming two general vector fields $v=v^je_j$ and $u=u^ie_j$ the formula says: $$\nabla_v u= (v^ju^i\Gamma^k_{ij}+v^j\frac{\partial u^k}{\partial x^j})\frac{\partial}{\partial x^k}$$ To find a local expression for an orthonormal frame, I assume that in the coordinates $x^1,x^2$ the metric is expressed by the first fundamental form $[\begin{smallmatrix} E & F \\ F & G \end{smallmatrix}]$ .

By our previous formula for two Lie algebra valued one forms we have that for $\eta=\text{Ad}_{\sigma_{f^{-1}}}\circ A$ , and $\omega=\sigma_f^*\mu_G$ : $$\frac{1}{2}\left([\eta,\omega]+[\omega,\eta]\right)(X,Y)=\frac{1}{2}\left([\eta(X),\omega(Y)]-[\eta(Y),\omega(X)]+[\omega(X),\eta(Y)]-[\omega(Y),\eta(X)]\right)$$ $$=[\eta(X),\omega(Y)]-[\eta(Y),\omega(X]$$ $$=[\eta,\omega](X,Y)$$ So I feel that: $$d(\text{Ad}_{\sigma_{f^{-1}}}\circ A)=\text{Ad}_{\sigma_{f^{-1}}}\circ dA-[\eta,\omega]$$ but I don't see why this should be true. In fact, since $\text{Ad}$ is a representation of $G$ on $\mathfrak{g}$ I would think that: $$d(\text{Ad}_{\sigma_{f^{-1}}}\circ A)=\text{Ad}_{\sigma_{f^{-1}}}\circ dA$$ but then I have this extra factor of $[\eta,\omega]$ , so I am at a loss. Any hints on how to calculate this exterior derivative, or on how that wedge product may actually be zero would be greatly beneficial. Edit: Employing Professor Shifrin's notation, I write that: $$f^*A=\sigma_{f^{-1}}A\sigma_f+\sigma_{f^{-1}}d\sigma_f$$ I have already calculated the exterior derivative of the second term, albeit in a different notation, so I move to the first term: $$d(\sigma_{f^{-1}}A\sigma_f)=d(\sigma_{f^{-1}})\wedge A\sigma_f+ \text{Ad}_{\sigma_f^{-1}}\circ dA+\sigma_{f^{-1}}A\wedge d(\sigma_f) $$ Note that: $$\sigma_{f^{-1}}\sigma_f=e$$ hence: $$d(\sigma_{f^{-1}})\sigma_f=-\sigma_{f^{-1}}d\sigma_f\Rightarrow d\sigma_{f^{-1}}=-\sigma_f^{-1}d\sigma_f\sigma_{f^{-1}}$$ Therefore we obtain: $$d(\sigma_{f^{-1}}A\sigma_f)=-\sigma_{f^{-1}}d\sigma_f\wedge \text{Ad}_{\sigma_f^{-1}}A+ \text{Ad}_{\sigma_f^{-1}}\circ dA-\text{Ad}_{\sigma_{f^{-1}}}\circ A \wedge d(\sigma_{f^{-1}})\sigma_f$$ The final term in this sum can be rewritten as: $$\text{Ad}_{\sigma_{f^{-1}}}\circ A \wedge d(\sigma_{f^{-1}})\sigma_f=-\text{Ad}_{\sigma_{f^{-1}}}\circ A \wedge \sigma_f^{-1}d\sigma_{f}$$ Thus: $$d(\sigma_{f^{-1}}A\sigma_f)=-\sigma_{f^{-1}}d\sigma_f\wedge \text{Ad}_{\sigma_f^{-1}}A+ \text{Ad}_{\sigma_f^{-1}}\circ dA+\text{Ad}_{\sigma_{f^{-1}}}\circ A \wedge \sigma_f^{-1}d\sigma_{f}$$ From here, I can kind of see how the pieces should move, but I am unsure why. Reconciling the two notations is proving troublesome to me. To be clearer, it seems that from the definition for the wedge product of twisted forms, this product is actually symmetric for one forms, so I feel like the first term and the last term would cancel, which doesn't make sense. I am then left to conclude that there is something different about the wedge product I have used in this edit, and the wedge product I used in the original post, but I am unsure what that difference actually is, or how to make it precise. Edit 2: The definition of wedge product for Lie algebra valued one forms is as follows: Given a $\omega\in \Omega^k(P,\mathfrak{g})$ and $\eta\in \Omega^k(P,\mathfrak{g})$ , then their wedge product is given by: $$[\omega,\eta](X_1,\dots,X_{k+l})=\frac{1}{k!l!}\sum_{\sigma\in S}\text{sign}(\sigma)\left[\omega(X_{\sigma(1)},\dots,X_{\sigma(k)}), \eta(X_{\sigma(k+1)},\dots,X_{\sigma(k+l)} ) \right]$$ When choosing a basis $\{T_i\}$ for the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ , we have that $\eta$ and $\omega$ can be written as: $$\eta=\sum_{i=1}^n \eta^i\otimes T_i$$ $$\omega=\sum_{i=1}^n \omega^i\otimes T_i$$ where each $\omega^i$ and $\eta^i$ are $k$ and $l$ forms on $P$ respectively. Then the wedge product can be written as $$\omega \wedge \eta =\sum_{i,j=1}^n \omega^i\wedge\eta^j\otimes[T_i, T_J]  $$ Hence: $$[\eta,\omega] =\sum_{i,j=1}^n \eta^j\wedge\omega^i\otimes[T_j,T_i] $$ $$=(-1)^{lk}\sum_{i,j=1}^n\eta^i \wedge\omega^j\otimes[T_j,T_i]$$ $$=(-1)^{lk+1}\sum_{i,j=1}^n\eta^i \wedge\omega^j\otimes[T_i,T_j]$$ $$=(-1)^{lk+1}[\omega,\eta]$$ So for two one forms, $\eta$ and $\omega$ : $$[\eta,\omega]=(-1)^2[\omega,\eta]=[\omega,\eta]$$ Hence the wedge product of Lie algebra valued forms is symmetric for one forms.","Let be a curvature two form on a principal bundle corresponding to the connection one form .

37,"If two points can be joined by a causal curve that is not a null geodesic, can they be joined by a timelike curve?","If two points can be joined by a causal curve that is not a null geodesic, can they be joined by a timelike curve?",,"Suppose $p$ and $q$ are connected by a causal (i.e. its tangent vectors have non-positive norm) curve $\gamma$ . If $\gamma$ is not a null geodesic, can it be deformed into a smooth, timelike curve still connecting $p$ and $q$ ? This is in Hawking and Ellis The large scale structure of space-time , Proposition 4.5.10. I write the proof below with as many details as I could fill in. Denote by $D_t$ the covariant derivative along $\gamma$ induced by the Levi-Civita connection $\nabla$ . We know $\gamma$ is a null geodesic if the acceleration vector $D_t \gamma '(t) = 0$ and $\langle \gamma'(t), \gamma'(t)\rangle = 0$ everywhere. Thus, if $\gamma$ is not a null geodesic, there must exist a point $t_0$ where $D_t\gamma'(t_0) \neq 0$ or where $\langle \gamma'(t_0), \gamma'(t_0) \rangle < 0$ . By continuity, if either of these cases hold, then they hold on an open interval $I = (t_1, t_2)$ . However, if $\langle \gamma'(t), \gamma'(t) \rangle < 0$ on $I$ then $\gamma$ is already timelike, so there is nothing to prove. Consequently, we assume that $D_t \gamma' \neq 0$ on $I$ . Here it is claimed in the book that $$ \langle D_t \gamma'(t), \gamma'(t) \rangle = \frac 12 \partial_t \langle \gamma'(t), \gamma'(t) \rangle = 0, $$ but I cannot see why this is so. Can we reparametrize any causal curve so its velocity has constant norm even it at some points the curve becomes null? Taking this for granted, we deduce that $D_t \gamma'$ is spacelike and thus $a(t) ^2 := \langle D_t \gamma'(t), D_t \gamma'(t)\rangle > 0$ on $I$ . We can Fermi transport a vector with positive inner product against $\gamma'$ to obtain a vector field $W$ along $\gamma|_I$ s.t. $c(t) := -\langle W, \gamma'(t)\rangle > 0$ on $I$ and generate the variation $$ \Gamma(s, t) = \exp_{\gamma(t)}(s (x W + y D_t \gamma'(t))), \quad S = \partial_s \Gamma(s, t), \quad T = \partial_t \Gamma(s, t) $$ where $x$ and $y$ are functions to be chosen momentarily but keeping in mind the requirement that $x(t_1) = x(t_2) = y(t_1) = y(t_2) = 0$ to ensure $\Gamma_s(t_1) = \gamma(t_1)$ and $\Gamma_s(t_2) = \gamma(t_2)$ . Then, $\Gamma_s(t)$ will be timelike if $\langle T, T \rangle < 0$ everywhere, which would hold if the the derivative with respect to $s$ at $s = 0$ were negative: \begin{align}   - 1 &= \frac{1}{2} \partial_s|_0 \langle T, T \rangle = \langle D_s T, T \rangle   \\       &= \langle D_t S, T \rangle & \nabla \text{ is torsion free,}   \\       &= \partial_t \langle S, T \rangle - \langle S, D_t T\rangle & \text{metric compatibility,}   \\   &= \partial_t (x \langle W, \gamma' \rangle) - x \langle W, D_t \gamma'\rangle - y \langle D_t \gamma', D_t \gamma'     \rangle & T|_{s = 0} = \gamma',   \\   &= u' + \langle W, D_t \gamma'\rangle c ^{-1} u - y a(t) ^2 & \text{Letting } u = - x c. \end{align} With the integrating factor $b(t) = -\int_{t_1} ^t \langle W, D_t \gamma'(s) \rangle c(s) ^{-1} \mathrm{d} s$ we have \begin{align} (u e ^{-b})' e ^{b} = y a(t) ^2 - 1 &\Rightarrow u = e ^b \int_{t_1} ^t e ^{-b(s)} (y(s) a(s) ^2 - 1)                       \mathrm{d} s   \\   &\Rightarrow x = c(t) ^{-1}e ^{b(t)} \int_{t_1} ^t e ^{-b(s)} (1 - y(s) a(s) ^2)                       \mathrm{d} s. \end{align} To satisfy our earlier constraints, we could let $y$ be a parabola with roots ata $t_1$ and $t_2$ . By scaling and applying the intermediate value theorem, we could find an appropriate factor s.t. $$ \int_{t_1} ^{t_2} e ^{-b(s)}(1 - y(s) a(s) ^2) \mathrm{d} s = 0$$ because $a(s)$ does not vanish.

52,Why is the Kaluza-Klein ansatz the natural choice?,Why is the Kaluza-Klein ansatz the natural choice?,,"In Kaluza-Klein theory we can choose a parametrisation for the 5-dimensional metric: $$d\hat{s}^2 \equiv \hat{g}_{ab} dx^a dx^b = g_{\mu\nu}dx^\mu dx^\nu + \phi^2(dz + A_\mu dx^\mu)^2 $$ where $g_{\mu\nu}$ is the metric for the 4 ""large"" dimensions (the base manifold) and $z$ is the coordinate running along the fifth dimension (the fiber). Greek indices run from 0 to 3 while latin indices run from 0 to 4 ( $z\equiv x^4$ ). The scalar $\phi$ parametrises the size of the extra dimension. I have heard that this choice of metric is ""natural"" from the fiber bundle perspective, within which the 5D spacetime is considered as a $U(1)$ -principle bundle and $A_\mu$ are the components of a connection 1-form defined on that bundle. For example, here the author says that this choice of metric: Preserves the split between vertical and horizontal vectors Has metric on the horizontal subspace isomorphic to the metric on the base space Has metric on the vertical subspace isomorphic to some metric on the Lie algebra of the structure group ( $U(1)$ in this case) First question: I am not sure I understand these conditions properly so would appreciate any further explanation.

I want to get a sense of the intuition behind what exactly a tangent vector is and how it's defined, and I break this up into four questions. 1) What is the purpose behind defining a tangent space? As I will write below, tangent vectors are defined in terms of directional derivative operators evaluated at $p$ . Is the only use behind tangent vectors to be able to take directional derivative? We might define a ""direction"" in our tangent space to be an operator that produces the directional derivative of a $C^{\infty}$ function in that ""direction"". Intuitively, this notion of direction doesn't look useful for doing anything other than taking directional derivatives; is that indeed the case? 2) Geometric Interpretation How would one visualize a tangent space?

How does this compare with visualizing the tangent space as a parallelepiped? 3) Definition 1: Smooth Curves We might define the tangent space as the equivalence class of all smooth curves $\gamma: \mathbb{R} \to M$ with $\gamma(0) = p$ , where two smooth curves $\gamma_{1}, \gamma_{2}$ are equivalent if $(\varphi \circ \gamma_{1})'(0) = (\varphi \circ \gamma_{2})'(0)$ . In this sense, each equivalence class defines a ""direction"" about $p$ , which helps us take directional derivatives. If $f: M \to \mathbb{R}$ is a smooth function, then $(f \circ \gamma)'(0)$ (differentiated in the ordinary sense, which makes sense here) is the directional derivative of $f$ in direction $\gamma$ . I again come back to my question of what use direction $\gamma$ is serving other than giving us directional derivatives. Now, I give the other definition, and want to know why these two definitions are exactly the same: 4) Definition 2: Directional Derivative Operator Note - This is often given in terms of ""derivations"" (linear maps that satisfy a generalized product rule, or Liebniz's rule): But a (non-trivial) result tells us that derivations are nothing but directional derivatives, so I stick to talking about directional derivatives here.

I've done this question because I would to prove the following interesting property: I think that this problem is well known, but I don't understand how to prove it. Let $\gamma=(\gamma_1,\gamma_2)$ be a continuous closed simple curve of $\mathbb{R}^2$ , so $\gamma:[0,1]\to \mathbb{R}^2$ is injective in $(0,1)$ , $\gamma(0)=\gamma(1)$ and it's a continuous function. The question is if there exists $4$ points $A,B,C,D$ on this curve for which the polygon $ABCD$ results to be a square. I guess is possible to prove a weaker thesis in a simple way, substituting the existence of a square with the existence of a rectangle. We know that $ABCD$ would be a rectangle if and only if $AB\cap CD=\{M\}$ where $M$ is the middle point of $AB$ and $CD$ , and $AB\cong CD$ .  Now we can interpret this property in this way: We define the following map $F:[0,1]\times [0,1]\to \mathbb{R}^3$ that maps each couple $(a,b)$ to $F(a,b):=\left(\frac{\gamma_1(a)+\gamma_1(b)}{2},\frac{\gamma_2(a)+\gamma_2(b)}{2}, ||\gamma(a)\gamma(b)||\right)$ This map associate to each couple of points $A$ and $B$ on the curve $\gamma$ , their middle point $M$ and the distance between them. We can observe that this map is continuous and it holds the following property: $F(0,b)=F(1,b)$ ; $F(a,0)=F(a,1)$ ; $F(a,b)=F(b,a)$ ; $F(a,a)=(\gamma(a),0)$ ; We define the following equivalence relation $\sim$ on $[0,1]\times [0,1]$ : for each $(a,b), (a',b')$ we say $a\sim b \iff (a,b)=(a',b')$ or $b=b'$ , $a=0,a'=1$ or $a=a'$ , $b=0,b'=1$ or $a=b'$ , $b=a'$ It's easy to check that $[0,1]\times[0,1]/\sim$ is the Moebius band $M$ and it's boundary is the image with respect the projection map of the diagonal $\Delta:=\{(a,a): a\in [0,1]\}$ . Now we observe that the map $F$ with that $4$ property induces a natural map $F^\sim : M\to \mathbb{R}^3$ defined in the following way: $F^\sim([(a,b)]):=F(a,b)$ Is clear that $F^\sim$ is a continuous map. Moreover we have $F^\sim([(a,a)])=(\gamma(a),0)\in \gamma([0,1])\times \{0\}$ , thus the boundary of the Moebius band $M$ is mapped by $F^\sim$ in a simple closed continuous curve of $\mathbb{R}^3$ contained in the plane $\{z=0\}$ . We observe that the existence of the rectangle $ABCD$ on the curve $\gamma$ is equivalent to say that the map $F^\sim$ is not injective. Arguing by contradiction, if $F^\sim$ would be injective, then $F^\sim: M\to F^\sim(M)\subseteq \mathbb{R}^3$ would be an homeomorphism because $M$ is compact and $\mathbb{R}^3$ is Housdorff, that means $F^\sim$ is also a closed map.

The second definition is the one where you require an atlas with transition functions like . I am not being formal because I think these are quite common definitions, and you know what I am talking about. The problem is proving that the second definition implies the first. The teacher suggests taking different topologies on and and then the product topology, but it is a quite short hint and I really don't understand what to do. Also, it is pointed out that the biggest problem here would be the second countability, but I can't understand the reasoning I should do.

94,Existence of only finitely many geodesics,Existence of only finitely many geodesics,,"The following question arose from Theorem 16.3 (p.90) in the book Morse theory from John Milnor. We are dealing with a complete Riemannian manifold $M$ , an $a \in \mathbb{R_{>0}}$ and two points $p,q \in M$ which are not conjugate along any geodesic from $p$ to $q$ of length $\le \sqrt{a}$ . Then the question is: Why are there only finitely many geodesics from $p$ to $q$ of length $\le \sqrt{a}$ . I have already tried arguing this way: Assume that there are infinitely many geodesics $(\gamma_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of the kind spoken of. Since the closed ball $B:=\{ v \in T_pM : \Vert v \Vert \le \sqrt{a}\}$ is compact (by Heine-Borel), there exists a subsequence of the vectors $(\gamma_n(0))_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \in B$ which converges against an $v_\infty \in B$ . The fact that solutions of DGLs depend continuously on the initial value provides that the curve $\gamma_{v_\infty} = exp(t \cdot v_\infty)$ also ends in $q$ . Now the idea is, that this sequence yields a proper, geodesic variation $\alpha:(-\varepsilon, \varepsilon) \times [0,1] \to M$ of $\gamma_{v_\infty}=\alpha(0,-)$ . This would yield a Jacobifield $J=\frac{D}{ds}\alpha(0,t)$ along $\gamma_{v_\infty}$ , which vanishes at $p$ and $q$ , so we get a contradiction to the premise that $p$ and $q$ are not conjugate along any geodesic. Solution : I don't think there is a way to extract uncountably many geodesics of length $\le \sqrt{a}$ , all of which connect $p$ and $q$ . So first of all, to get a variation $\alpha:(-1,1) \times [0,1] \to M$ we may do the following: Let $(v_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be the (sub)sequence converging to $v_\infty$ . Set $v:(-1,1) \to B; v\left(\frac{1}{n}\right) := v_n$ for $n \ge 2$ . Then extend $v$ differentiably (i.e. by connecting the $v_n$ through lines and then smoothing the edges out). Finally, set $\alpha(s,t) := exp(t \cdot v(s))$ . As $M$ is complete, this makes sense and is well defined. This certainly is a geodesic variation of $\gamma_{v_\infty}$ . What remains to show is that the vector field $\frac{D}{ds}\alpha(0,t)$ vanishes at $q$ (to get the contradiction from above). Notice, that the $\alpha(s,-)$ mustn't connect $p$ and $q$ for all $s$ , but for $s=\frac{1}{n}$ . Since $\alpha$ is differentiable, we can compute $\frac{D}{ds}\alpha(0,1)$ by choosing the sequence $(s_n=\frac{1}{n})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ which yields $\frac{D}{ds}\alpha(0,1) = 0$ since the difference quotient is 0 for all $s_n$ because the $\alpha(s_n,-)$ connect $p$ and $q$ by our assumption.","The following question arose from Theorem 16.3 (p.90) in the book Morse theory from John Milnor.

Then $$ (d \varphi (v) f) \varphi (p) = \left. \frac{d}{dt} (f \circ \varphi \circ \alpha) \right|_{t=0} = v(f \circ \varphi)(p) $$ I don't get the very last line, I suppose it follows from the definition given of tangent vector, but I really can't work out the details. Could you explain more in detail that line? Thank you (P.S. here $M$ is a differentiable manifold). Update : In the statement of this theorem $\beta$ is defined as $\beta = \varphi \circ \alpha$ . Given a curve $\alpha : (-\epsilon,\epsilon) \to M$ (differentiable manifold) a tangent vector is defined as $$ \alpha'(0) f = \frac{d}{dt} (f \circ \alpha). $$ Using $\beta$ instead of $\alpha$ we have $$ \beta'(0)f = \frac{d}{dt}(f \circ \beta) = \frac{d}{dt}(f \circ \varphi \circ \alpha) $$ but $\beta'(0) = d \varphi_p(v)$ therefore $\beta'(0) f = d \varphi_p(v) f$ and therefore we have $$ d \varphi_p(v) f = \frac{d}{dt}(f \circ \varphi \circ \alpha) $$ Therefore what I think I'm actually missing is the meaning of the notation $ \left( d \varphi_p(v) f \right) \varphi(p)$ More details Just to clarify, my previous update is my interpretation of the notation used, I've noticed there's some inconsistencies (I think) in the notation used throughout the book (at least for chapter 0). 1) In definition 2.6. The author defines a tangent vector to a differentiable manifold $M$ as an operator $\alpha'(0) : \cal{D} \to \mathbb{R}$ , where $\cal{D}$ is the set of differentiable functions defined on $M$ . Such description makes very clear to me the meaning of the notation $\alpha'(0)f$ , If I view it as an operator. Moreover we have the expression given $$ \alpha'(0) f = \frac{d}{dt}(f \circ \alpha) $$ The right handside of the expression in terms of computation is clear to me, because of the parameterization. 2) In proposition 2.7, given a differentiable map $\varphi$ between two differentiable manifolds $M_1^n, M_2^m$ and the differential $d \varphi_p(v)$ is defined. To define this differential we need a $p \in M_1^n$ and a tangent vector $v \in T_p M_1^n$ . The differential is a map from $T_p M_1^n$ to $T_{\varphi(p)} M_2^m$ , and therefore it acts as an operator from the set of differentiable functions on $M_2^m$ to $\mathbb{R}$ . Thefore the meaning of the notation $ d \varphi_p(v) f $ is still clear to me. 3) My original question concern page 26 of the book, where the notation $(d \varphi(v) f)\varphi(p)$ is introduced. The reason I get confused is in the first place I think there's a mistake in the notation used because if you compare $d \varphi_p(v) f$ against $(d \varphi (v) f) \varphi(p)$ there's some difference. I don't know for example what $d \varphi(v)$ means, but I do know what $d \varphi_p(v)$ means.
