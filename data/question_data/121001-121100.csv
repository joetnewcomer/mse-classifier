0,Interpolation between two points,Interpolation between two points,,"I am looking for an interpolation between two points $P$ and $Q$. I need the curve to have derivative (direction) $\vec{v_1}$ at point P and $\vec{v_2}$ at point Q. In addition, there is a maximum curvature constraint (represented as minimum radius $r$). I want to find a curve that satisfies those constraints and having minimum distance. Is there an analytical solution or does any programming language package (e.g. MATLAB) support numerical calculation for this? If this one is hard to find, would dropping the minimum distance constraint and instead adding minimizing overall curvature be easier? P.S. This spline may be a famous one but I don't know the name. Searching online by these criteria does not give me meaningful result. Thanks.","I am looking for an interpolation between two points $P$ and $Q$.

It asks to show that the cosine of an angle of a rational triangle can be written in one of the forms $f(\alpha,\beta)=\dfrac{\alpha^2-\beta^2}{\alpha^2+\beta^2}$ or $g(\alpha,\beta)=\dfrac{2\alpha\beta}{\alpha^2+\beta^2}$ where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are coprime positive integers. The first form I can get.  Following logic similar to previous examples, draw in the height of the triangle, making a right triangle. The hypoteneuse is one side of the rational triangle and the height is opposite one of the angles of the rational triangle (or $180^o$ minus it, the book doesn't seem to consider this case).  The book makes a quick reference that the length of the other leg must be rational since the cosine must be rational due to the law of cosines.  Let's call the length of the hypoteneuse $x$, the height is of course $h$, and the other leg has length $z$.  Then we have $$h^2=x^2-z^2=(x+z)(x-z)$$ Following the book's example, there exists a rational $m$ such that $$x+z=m,x-z=\frac {h^2}m$$ This system can be solved for $x$ and $z$.  Then we get our cosine is $\frac zx=\frac{m^2-h^2}{m^2+h^2}$.  (Of course if the angle of the rational triangle is obtuse,we found the cosine of the supplementary angle and the cosine of the angle we actually want is $\frac{h^2-m^2}{h^2+m^2}$.) Multiply top and bottom by the square of the lowest common denominator of $h$ and $m$ and divide by the square of the gcd of their numerators to get the first form. This seems to imply that the cosine of any angle of a rational triangle can be written in this form.  I have no idea how to obtain the $g(\alpha,\beta)$ form unless we deal with pythagorean triples, in which knowing the form makes it rather trivial.  So first of all, how do I obtain the form $g(\alpha,\beta)?$ It also seems that these forms are not mutually exclusive.  For example, $f(3,1)=g(2,1)=\frac45$.

The outer angle bisector of B and the outer angle bisector of C meet in  point O. I need to show that AO is the angle bisector of A. In the question there's some guidance that says that from point O we should draw a perpendicular line to BC and to AB and to AC. I've been trying to solve this question for a couple of days now and still no success. I think that if I can show angle CBO is equal to BCO then that will allow me to solve the question.

So I did some doodles to try and see why is it possible to sometimes determine a triangle given only $2$ sides and a non included angle.

What you will notice is that sometimes the circle is too small and the angle is too big so the line never touches the circle.

So we can easily show that $AC \perp BD$ , which makes the angle between these two lines $90^{\circ}$ We can use Chasles Formula (I explained it in the comments) and we get that the volume of the regular tetrahedron is $= \frac{AC\times BD\times dis(AC, BD)\times\sin{90^{\circ}}}{6}$ . We can say that because we have a regular tetrahedron $AC=BD$ and we also know that $\sin{90^{\circ}}=1$ If we can express the volume again using the given distance we can find the distance between $AC$ and $BD$ .

86,What constitutes a direct proof?,What constitutes a direct proof?,,"Suppose I want to prove the following elementary theorem: The perpendicular bisector of the base of an isosceles triangle is the angular bisector of its vertex angle. To do so, I would start by drawing the angular bisector of the vertex angle, and show that it must be a perpendicular bisector of the base. Since there exists a unique perpendicular bisector of the base, if we draw a perpendicular bisector of the base, we will inevitably draw what we just drew, the angular bisector of the vertex angle, hence proving the proposition. This method of proof, which in Asia (and by Asia I mean Japan and Korea) is introduced as an example of an indirect proof (the translation of which I could not find, hence the question), is described as follows: Suppose I want to prove that B is A. I then prove that A is B instead, and then prove that B is unique. Thus this unique B must be A also, completing the proof.

[...] - Weisstein, Eric W. ""Mice Problem."" From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource. I would like to calculate the distance of the closest mice given a distance traveled $s$ . Background If you're wondering why I want to calculate this, I just read about the problem in Math World > History and Terminology Disciplinary Terminology Biological Terminology > Mise Problem . That's when I saw the animations of the mise and wanted to animate them too. The connection between this problem and the Whirl struck me, and that's when the question came up after the Whirl gave me a context. With a few seconds of thinking I figured that position doesn't just depend on distance traveled, previous position and speed, so it should change to an ODE / PDE, which sounds like a fun project. My Two Best Trys Numerical Trys A plot of the first $3$ steps ( $\color{green}{\frac{1}{2}}$ distance and $\color{orange}{\frac{1}{4}}$ distance (for the first step)): Are $\left( x_{1}, y_{1} \right)$ the coordinates of one mouse $a_{1}$ and $\left( x_{2}, y_{2} \right)$ those of the other, then $a_{2} = \left( \frac{x_{1} + x_{2}}{2}, \frac{y_{1} + y_{2}}{2} \right)$ when half distance. Now say that $\left( x_{n}, y_{n} \right)$ are the coordinates of the other mouse in $n - 1$ step: $$ \begin{align*} a_{1} &= \left( x_{1}, y_{1} \right)\\ a_{2} &= \left( \frac{x_{1} + x_{2}}{2}, \frac{y_{1} + y_{2}}{2} \right)\\ a_{3} &= \left( \frac{\frac{x_{1} + x_{2}}{2} + x_{3}}{2}, \frac{\frac{y_{1} + y_{2}}{2} + y_{3}}{2} \right)\\ &\dots\\ a_{n} &= \left( \frac{\frac{\frac{\frac{x_{1} + x_{2}}{2} + x_{3}}{2} + \ddots}{\ddots} + x_{n}}{2}, \frac{\frac{\frac{\frac{y_{1} + y_{2}}{2} + y_{3}}{2} + \ddots}{\ddots} + y_{n}}{2} \right)\\ \end{align*} $$ So $\lim\limits_{n \to \infty}\left[ a_{n} \right] = 0$ . The whole thing is the same for each step for any distance with small changes in the formula, but the appearance changes only minimally. If we do this for all points, we could represent the distance between the points as infinite continued fractions, but that's not exactly what I want. Try with Polar Coordinates You could also try the pursuit curve to determine which describes the positions of the mise in space: Let's say $r_{m}$ is the perimeter of the polygon in at $m$ . If we form the gradient of one of the lines we are looking for into a subwhirl, we get $\Delta = \frac{r \cdot \sin\left( \theta + \frac{2 \cdot \pi}{n} \right) - r \cdot \sin\left( \theta \right)}{r \cdot \cos\left( \theta + \frac{2 \cdot \pi}{n} \right) - r \cdot \cos\left( \theta \right)} = \frac{\left( \cos\left( \frac{2 \cdot \pi}{n} \right) - 1 \right) \cdot \sin\left( \theta \right) + \sin\left( \frac{2 \cdot \pi}{n} \right) \cdot \cos\left( \theta \right)}{\left( \cos\left( \frac{2 \cdot \pi}{n} \right) - 1 \right) \cdot \cos\left( \theta \right) - \sin\left( \frac{2 \cdot \pi}{n} \right) \cdot \sin\left( \theta \right)}$ . For this we assume that the polygons have been wired for $y$ -axis symmetry. Since they move the mice on their respective pursuit curve, the following applies: ""The slope of the line is also equal to the derivative of the pursuit curve."" aka: $$ \begin{align*} \frac{\operatorname{d}y}{\operatorname{d}x} &= \frac{r' \cdot \sin\left( \theta \right) + r \cdot \sin'\left( \theta \right)}{r' \cdot \cos\left( \theta \right) + r \cdot \cos'\left( \theta \right)}\\ \frac{\operatorname{d}y}{\operatorname{d}x} &= \frac{\cos\left( \theta \right)\, \operatorname{d}\theta + \sin\left( \theta \right)\, \operatorname{d}r}{\cos\left( \theta \right)\, \operatorname{d}r - \sin\left( \theta \right)\, \operatorname{d}\theta}\\ \end{align*} $$ Both equations describe the same thing aka $\Delta = \frac{\operatorname{d}y}{\operatorname{d}x}$ applies, which means that: $$ \begin{align*} \Delta &= \frac{\operatorname{d}y}{\operatorname{d}x}\\ \frac{\left( \cos\left( \frac{2 \cdot \pi}{n} \right) - 1 \right) \cdot \sin\left( \theta \right) + \sin\left( \frac{2 \cdot \pi}{n} \right) \cdot \cos\left( \theta \right)}{\left( \cos\left( \frac{2 \cdot \pi}{n} \right) - 1 \right) \cdot \cos\left( \theta \right) - \sin\left( \frac{2 \cdot \pi}{n} \right) \cdot \sin\left( \theta \right)} &= \frac{\cos\left( \theta \right)\, \operatorname{d}\theta + \sin\left( \theta \right)\, \operatorname{d}r}{\cos\left( \theta \right)\, \operatorname{d}r - \sin\left( \theta \right)\, \operatorname{d}\theta}\\ \end{align*} $$ Wolfram|Alpha simplifies the whole thing to $\sin\left( \frac{2 \cdot \pi}{n} \right) \cdot \frac{1}{r}\, \operatorname{d}r = \left( \cos\left( \frac{2 \cdot \pi}{n} \right) - 1 \right)\, \operatorname{d}\theta$ aka we'll get (assuming $r \in \mathbb{R}^{+})$ : $$ \begin{align*} \sin\left( \frac{2 \cdot \pi}{n} \right) \cdot \frac{1}{r}\, \operatorname{d}r &= \left( \cos\left( \frac{2 \cdot \pi}{n} \right) - 1 \right)\, \operatorname{d}\theta\\ \int \sin\left( \frac{2 \cdot \pi}{n} \right) \cdot \frac{1}{r}\, \operatorname{d}r &= \int \left( \cos\left( \frac{2 \cdot \pi}{n} \right) - 1 \right)\, \operatorname{d}\theta\\ \sin\left( \frac{2 \cdot \pi}{n} \right) \cdot \int \frac{1}{r}\, \operatorname{d}r &= \left( \cos\left( \frac{2 \cdot \pi}{n} \right) - 1 \right) \cdot \theta + \text{cconstant}\\ \int \frac{1}{r}\, \operatorname{d}r &= \frac{\cos\left( \frac{2 \cdot \pi}{n} \right) - 1}{\sin\left( \frac{2 \cdot \pi}{n} \right)} \cdot \theta + \text{constant}\\ \ln\left( r \right) &= \frac{\cos\left( \frac{2 \cdot \pi}{n} \right) - 1}{\sin\left( \frac{2 \cdot \pi}{n} \right)} \cdot \theta + \text{constant}\\ r &= e^{\frac{\cos\left( \frac{2 \cdot \pi}{n} \right) - 1}{\sin\left( \frac{2 \cdot \pi}{n} \right)} \cdot \theta + \text{constant}}\\ \end{align*} $$ We can determine the constant by the boundary condition that there are at least $3$ points lying on the unit circle. Let's just say that the curve $\left( 1,\, \frac{3 \cdot \pi}{2} - \frac{\pi}{n} \right)$ goes, then $\text{costant} \equiv \frac{\cos\left( \frac{2 \cdot \pi}{n} \right) - 1}{\sin\left( \frac{2 \cdot \pi}{n} \right)} \cdot \left( \frac{\pi}{n} - \frac{3 \cdot \pi}{2} \right)$ holds. We can now rotate the spiral arbitrarily by an angle $\theta_{0}$ in order to define it for the other mises and not for the $y$ -axis symmetrical polygons: $$\fbox{$ \begin{align*} r &= e^{\frac{\cos\left( \frac{2 \cdot \pi}{n} \right) - 1}{\sin\left( \frac{2 \cdot \pi}{n} \right)} \cdot \left( \theta - \theta_{0} \right) + \frac{\cos\left( \frac{2 \cdot \pi}{n} \right) - 1}{\sin\left( \frac{2 \cdot \pi}{n} \right)} \cdot \left( \frac{\pi}{n} - \frac{3 \cdot \pi}{2} \right)}\\ \end{align*} $}$$ Checking the formula for some examples like a rectangle seems to work aka I assume the formula is right: However, I have some problems with the curve: Of course I could use it to determine the distances between the mise, but only as a function of the angle $\theta - \theta_{0}$ and not the distance. We could calculate the arc length from the angle, but the resulting integral seems a bit too complicated to me. In addition, I can't really understand the simplification that led to the result and I can't reconstruct it either...

94,Deriving the power series for sine and cosine from geometry,Deriving the power series for sine and cosine from geometry,,"A few years ago, I saw an article that showed that it was possible to derive the power series for sine and cosine using a tail-to-tip chord approximation in the unit circle. Basically, one first create a chord of length $0 \leqslant \theta \leqslant 2$ starting from the origin point $(1,0)$ to a point $P_1$ on the unit circle. Now, if you divide the length $\theta$ by a given constant $n$ and create a sequence of multiple tail-to-tip chords, then you have $n$ points on the unit circle from $P_1$ to $P_n$ and the total length [of all chords] remains $\theta$ . You want to find the couple $(x_n,y_n)$ by solving the tail-to-tip recurrence system given by $$ \begin{cases}   (x_k - x_{k-1})^2 + (y_k - y_{k-1})^2 = \left(\frac\theta n\right)^2 \\   (x_k)^2 + (x_k)^2 = 1 \end{cases} $$ Trying to first the first couple $(x_1,y_1)$ we have $$ \begin{cases}   (x_1 - x_0)^2 + (y_1 - y_0)^2 = \left(\frac\theta n\right)^2 \\   (x_1)^2 + (y_1)^2 = 1 \end{cases} $$ And it's not hard to show that $$ x_0 \neq 0, y_0 = 0 \implies x_1 = \frac{(x_0)^2 - (\theta/n)^2 + 1}{2x_0}, y_1 = \sqrt{1 - (x_1)^2} $$ We know that $P_0 = (1,0)$ so we can easily compute $P_1$ from the formula above. Further terms can be computed using iterative substitution, aka the ""plug and chug"" method. Indeed, we can show that $$ x_0 \neq 0, y_0 = 0 \implies x_k = \frac{(x_{k-1})^2 - (\theta/n)^2 + 1}{2x_{k-1}}, y_k = \sqrt{1 - (x_k)^2} $$ Now, expanding this whole expression becomes very cumbersome for $k > 2$ and we want to find an explicit formula instead, that is, one which doesn't involve $x_{k-1}$ in the expression. I tried to do the substitution up to $k = 3$ but I failed to identify a recurring pattern. From the geometric intuition, though, we should have $$ x_n \sim \cos(\theta) \quad \text{and} \quad y_n \sim \sin(\theta) \quad \text{as} \ n \to \infty $$ A lot of steps have been skipped in the original article, and somehow, the final result is as follows $$ x_n = \sum_{k=0}^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor}(-1)^k \bigg({n \atop 2k}\bigg) \bigg(1 - \frac{(\theta/n)^2}{2}\bigg)^{n-2k} \bigg(\frac\theta n\bigg)^{2k} \bigg(1 - \frac{(\theta/n)^2}{4}\bigg)^k $$ and $$ y_n = \sum_{k=0}^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor}(-1)^k \bigg({n \atop 2k+1}\bigg) \bigg(1 - \frac{(\theta/n)^2}{2}\bigg)^{n-2k-1} \bigg(\frac\theta n\bigg)^{2k+1} \bigg(1 - \frac{(\theta/n)^2}{4}\bigg)^{k+(1/2)} $$ In the limit as $n \to \infty$ and glossing over some convergence details, it can be shown that the two above expressions simplify to the power series of cosine and sine, respectively.

95,How to find all possible connections between immediate lattice points in a $n\times n$ square?,How to find all possible connections between immediate lattice points in a  square?,n\times n,"I am not a mathematician so my terminology might be not correct, please ignore it. I want to calculate all possible connections between immediate lattice points in a $n\times n$ square. Here lattice points are all points $(x, y)$ that satisfies $x \in \Bbb{N}, y \in \Bbb{N}$ and $x \le n, y \le n \ (n \in \Bbb{N}, n \ge 2)$ , the square is in the first quadrant and its lower left corner is the origin, and two lattice points are immediate if they can be connected without the connection passing through another lattice point. I have thoroughly investigated cases where $n \in \{2, 3, 4\}$ , and found the following: When $n = 2$ , it is this: It is not interesting, there are $4$ points and $6$ connections, $4$ connections of length $1$ and $2$ connections of length $\sqrt{2}$ , and every connection is valid: ${4 \choose 2} = \frac{4 \cdot 3}{2} = 6 $ . When $n > 2$ , things get interesting. I have manually created the graphs using GeoGebra and identified different types of lattices and colored the connections accordingly for convenience. The above picture shows when $n = 3$ , there are $9$ points and ${9 \choose 2} = \frac{9 \cdot 8}{2} = 36$ , however only $28$ connections are between immediate points, as $8$ connections overlap other connections. More specifically, there are $3$ types of points, $4$ corner points, $4$ midline points and $1$ center, and connections of lengths $\{1, \sqrt{2}, \sqrt{5}\}$ with 12 connections of length 1, 8 connections of length $\sqrt{2}$ and 8 connections of length $\sqrt{5}$ . Opposite points cannot be connected directly. When $n = 4$ : There are $3$ types of points when $n = 4$ , there are $4$ corners, $8$ midline points and $4$ inner points. There are ${16 \choose 2} = \frac{16 \cdot 15}{2} = 120$ total possible connections, but only $86$ connections are valid. In the above picture, there are $24$ connections of length $1$ , $18$ of $\sqrt{2}$ , $24$ of $\sqrt{5}$ , $12$ of $\sqrt{10}$ and $8$ of $\sqrt{13}$ . It is easy to see corner points cannot connect to each other, points on edges can only connect to $3$ other points horizontally and vertically, while points inside the square can connect to $4$ other points horizontally and vertically. Each red point connects to $2$ blue points on the edges that intersect at it and cannot connect to the other $2$ blue points on those $2$ edges. Each red points can connect to the other $4$ blue points that aren't colinear with it. So each red point can form $6$ magenta connections for a total of $4 \cdot 6 = 24$ magenta connections. Each red point can connect to $3$ green points and not the green point opposite it so there are $12$ yellow connections. Each blue point can connect to every other blue point except the $2$ at $3$ indices offset in either direction (clockwise or counterclockwise), so there are $\frac{8 \cdot (7 - 2)}{2} = 20$ blue connections. Each green point can connect to all $4$ blue points that aren't colinear with it but only $2$ blue points from the $4$ colinear points. So there are $4 \cdot 6 = 24$ cyan connections. Lastly the $4$ green points can connect to each other, so there are $6$ green connections, and order $4$ contains order $2$ . For higher orders, the number of total connections blows up quickly so I couldn't do it manually, for example the number of total connections of order $5$ is ${25 \choose 2} = 300$ , but I did write a simple Python program to visualize the linear combinations with all the duplicates: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from itertools import combinations, product from matplotlib.collections import LineCollection  def graph(n):     points = list(product(range(n), repeat=2))     segments = list(combinations(points, r=2))      fig, ax = plt.subplots()     ax.add_collection(LineCollection(segments))     ax.set_axis_off()     plt.axis('scaled')     fig.subplots_adjust(left=0, bottom=0, right=1, top=1, wspace=0, hspace=0)     plt.show() And below are pictures of orders $5$ and $6$ : As you can see, order $5$ contains order $3$ and order $6$ contains order $4$ .

My current approach is dividing the curves into small line segments and checking the winding number - which is a common approach although requires thousands of segments for very large curves and high accuracy. But given i have arcs I am wondering if i can simplify this checking. I provided a sample image of a shape made of arcs (each arc alternating in color). Some current observations I found when testing but doesn't succeed for all cases: If the arcs are ordered for an overall CCW direction of the complete polygon, then you know you're in the shape if you overlap an arc sector and the given arc is also CCW. You're also not in the shape if you overlap an arc that is going CW (in the case of the concave area of the shape). However this doesn't quite cover everything after some further testing because you can overlap a CCW and a CW arc area at the same time (see image below): Wondering if any one has some insights on how this might be solvable to avoid using thousands of line segments to get a winding number which is an expensive calculation to do.","I was wondering if there is a simplified way to determine if a point lies inside a polygon shape if the shape is represented only by circular arcs (not bezier or other complicated curves).

But given i have arcs I am wondering if i can simplify this checking. I provided a sample image of a shape made of arcs (each arc alternating in color). Some current observations I found when testing but doesn't succeed for all cases: If the arcs are ordered for an overall CCW direction of the complete polygon, then you know you're in the shape if you overlap an arc sector and the given arc is also CCW. You're also not in the shape if you overlap an arc that is going CW (in the case of the concave area of the shape).

From $\angle DFQ=\angle IFA=\dfrac\pi2$ , $\angle DFI=\angle QFA$ . In addition, $\angle FQD=\dfrac\pi2-\angle FDQ=\dfrac12\angle A$ . Since $AE=AF$ , $E$ , $Q$ and $F$ are all on some circle centered at $A$ . So $AF=AQ$ . Therefore $\triangle DFI\sim\triangle QFA$ . Using this pair of similar triangles, $$\angle QAE=\angle FAQ-\angle A=\angle FID-\angle A=\pi-\angle A-\angle B=\angle C$$ so $AQ\parallel BC$ . This provides a better (perhaps) definition of $Q$ . $R$ is on $EF$ , the polar line of $A$ with respect to $\odot I$ . So $A$ should be on that of $R$ .
