This is a genuinely academic question, and not meant to be political in any way. I am not sure this is the best SE site for this question, but it is definitely the best one to ask questions about SIR models, so let me give it a try. I have been watching the rapid rise in covid cases in Florida and Texas due to the Delta variant of Covid over the past 6 weeks or so. As we know, the governor in Florida and Texas were quite opposed to imposing any restrictions for masking or encouraging vaccinations, etc. That is just what I am seeing in the new coverage. Now SIR models are used to model epidemic disease spread. So if we have a mixing population with no additional restrictions, a vanilla SIR model would predict continued transmission of the illness until everyone is either recovered, infected, or dead. That is the very toy and simple result of what an SIR model would provide. Now, I am trying to understand what is causing the deceleration in cases in Florida and Texas, given that these states don't seem to be taking the actions that would diminish the transmission rate for the delta strain. That is the question? It could be that despite the governor's actions in both states, the local restrictions are having an impact. Though I have not heard of any locally imposed lockdown or such--I figured the governor would need to order that. Or is it that people are just changing their own behavior to increase distancing or not going to restaurants again,etc? Or are the governors doing more than is covered on the news? Again, I know that SIR models are far from predictive models, but I was just trying to understand how these real life waves of infection can end when restrictions are seemingly not imposed. Again, my question is simply academic. Thanks.","This is a question about SIR or SEIR models and understanding the trajectory of the covid infections in Florida and Texas in September 2021.
