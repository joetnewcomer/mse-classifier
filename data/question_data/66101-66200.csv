0,How many 90 ball bingo cards are there?,How many 90 ball bingo cards are there?,,"In the UK there are 90 bingo balls. A bingo card consists of 9 columns and 3 rows. A row contains exactly five numbers and four blanks. A column consists of one, two or three numbers and never three blanks. The columns are occupied by the number chosen from 1-9 (only nine), 10-19 (ten), 20-29 ... 70-79 and importantly 80-90 (eleven). Numbers in columns are ordered from top to bottom. How many possible unnumbered card layouts are there? How many possible numbered cards are there? I have started to approach this problem by first choosing the blanks for the first two rows and then attempting to work out a compensating row. This was hard. Next I begun to understand that there were a number of equivalence classes as columns could be reordered for the purposes producing different layouts. Next I looked into the most convoluted card which had five numbers followed by four blanks in the first row and four blanks followed five number in the second. This satisfied the ""no blank column"" requirement. Now the final row could be arranged however it wanted, though there was one confusing overlap to deal with. I considered another convoluted card which had as many columns of three as possible. It turns out it's possible have a maximum of three columns of three which also gives rise to the maximum of six columns of one. It also turns out you can have a maximum of six columns of two. I think the starting point might be to determine the classes of card initially by column combinations and then permute them. Having gotten all muddled by the layouts, I turned to the numbers. With a single number, it was one of 9, 10 or 11 depending on the column and that was easy. For the two number case, let's say with a column of ten, the first ($i$) was chosen from 9 and the next from $10-i$. It suddenly occurred to me that it was just combinations, phew. How to fit that with the whole business of column choice lost me. It seems possible that for each possible ""set"" of columns, there will be a way of determining the distribution of possible first columns and adding in an appropriate factor for the number combinations. Frankly, it's all getting bigger than my coffee table. Any simplifications from higher maths I'm missing?","In the UK there are 90 bingo balls. A bingo card consists of 9 columns and 3 rows.

Examples : Find a finite set $A$ and $B \subset 2^A$ such that any element of $A$ is covered by at least 100 sets in $B$, but $B$ cannot be partitioned into 2 disjoint sets, each covering $A$. Find the shortest sequence of numbers between 1 and K (K=99) such that each pair of numbers are adjacent somewhere in the sequence (1231 is an answer if K=3). Find a systematic way to arrange a round robin tournament between N teams (N even or odd). Find (different methods) to cover the complete graph on 50 vertices by disjoint spanning trees.

Must we have $$ k\le \dfrac{m^2}{8}? $$ The relation $k\le \dfrac{m^2}{8}$ is based on the following two observations: Observation 1. If $a_1,\cdots,a_n$ consists of only $1$ 's and $2$ 's, then we have $k\le \dfrac{m^2}{8}$ , and the result is optimal. Proof . WLOG we can suppose that the last term in the sequence is $2$ . Suppose that there are $t$ $2$ 's, and the number of $1$ 's to the left of each $2$ is $b_1,\cdots,b_t$ , then $$ b_1\le \cdots\le b_t,\quad m=b_t+2t,\quad k=b_1+\cdots+b_t. $$ We then have $k\le tb_t\le\dfrac{(b_t+2t)^2}{8}=\dfrac{m^2}{8}$ . Moreover, it is possible that $k=\left\lfloor\dfrac{m^2}{8}\right\rfloor$ : Let $t$ be the integer closest to $\dfrac{m}{4}$ (choose either one in case of a tie), and $$ b_1=\cdots=b_t = m-2t, $$ which means that we pick the sequence consisting of $m-2t$ $1$ 's followed by $t$ $2$ 's. Then we have $k=t(m-2t)$ , and we see that \begin{align*} m\equiv 0\,(\operatorname{mod}\,4)&\Rightarrow t=\dfrac{m}{4}\Rightarrow k=\dfrac{m^2}{8};\\ m\equiv 1\,(\operatorname{mod}\,4)&\Rightarrow t=\dfrac{m-1}{4}\Rightarrow k=\dfrac{m^2-1}{8};\\ m\equiv 2\,(\operatorname{mod}\,4)&\Rightarrow t=\dfrac{m-2}{4}\text{ or }\dfrac{m+2}{4}\Rightarrow k=\dfrac{m^2-4}{8};\\ m\equiv 3\,(\operatorname{mod}\,4)&\Rightarrow t=\dfrac{m+1}{4}\Rightarrow k=\dfrac{m^2-1}{8}, \end{align*} so $k=\left\lfloor\dfrac{m^2}{8}\right\rfloor$ in this case. Note 1.1. We can see that $k=0,\cdots,\left\lfloor\dfrac{m^2}{8}\right\rfloor$ are all possible because a nonincreasing sequence corresponds to $k=0$ , and swapping two adjacent entries in a sequence would leave $m$ unchanged, but $k$ changed by $0$ or $\pm 1$ . Note 1.2. The construction above gives the only optimal solutions. Indeed, if $k=\left\lfloor\dfrac{m^2}{8}\right\rfloor$ , then $$ t(m-2t)=tb_t\ge k=\left\lfloor\dfrac{m^2}{8}\right\rfloor\Rightarrow \left|t-\dfrac{m}{4}\right|\le\dfrac{1}{2}, k=tb_t\text{ (hence }b_1=\cdots=b_t). $$ Observation 2. If $a_1,\cdots,a_n$ is nondecreasing, then $k\le\dfrac{m^2}{8}$ , and the result is also optimal. Proof . Suppose that each of $1,2,\cdots$ occurs $c_1,c_2,\cdots$ times in the sequence, where $c_i\neq 0$ for finitely many $i$ , then $$ m=c_1+2c_2+\cdots,\quad k=\sum_{i<j}c_ic_j=\dfrac{1}{2}\sum_{i\neq j}c_ic_j, $$ so we have $$ m^2 - 8k = (c_1 - 2c_2 - c_3)^2 + 8c_3^2 + \sum^{\infty}_{i=4}i^2c_i^2+\sum_{\max\{i,j\}\ge 4,i\neq j}(ij-4)c_ic_j\ge 0. $$ The result $k\le\dfrac{m^2}{8}$ for nondecreasing sequences is also optimal as shown by the $1-2$ sequences above. Note 2.1. If the equality holds, then we must have $c_3=c_4=\cdots=0$ , otherwise we would have $m^2-8k\ge 8c_i^2\ge 8$ . I don't have any idea for the general case. I guess that if $k$ attains its maximum with $m$ fixed, then $a_1,\cdots,a_n$ must consist of only $1$ 's and $2$ 's , but I don't know how to prove it. Any help appreciated. Edit. This question turns out to be trivial. For a general sequence, we apply the process of bubble sort. At each step either we do nothing, either we create a new increasing pair, so $k$ reaches its maximum when and only when the sequence is nondecreasing, and the result $k\le\dfrac{m^2}{8}$ follows from Observation 2 above.","Let be a sequence of positive integers such that ; The number of pairs such that and is .

Let us denote $u_{N, t}$ this quantity. For instance, for $t=4$ and $N=128$ , $(1, 4, 1, 4)$ is a valid tuple (each element within the tuple has at least one other copy) but $(1, 4, 1, 1)$ is not ( $4$ is alone). It is fairly simple to see that: $u(N, 1)=0$ , since every tuple will contain a single element, it can't have any other copies of it $u(N, 2)=N$ , since every valid tuple can be written as $(x, x)$ , with $x\in[N]$ $u(N, 3)=N$ , since every valid tuple can be written as $(x, x, x)$ My reasoning for the general case is the following: $u_{N, t}$ is equal to $N^t$ minus the number of tuples such that at least one element is unique. For $k\geqslant1$ , we thus choose the positions of the unique elements, for which we have $\binom{t}{k}$ choices We have to choose the values for these elements, for which we have $\frac{N!}{(N-k)!}$ choices. We finally have to choose the values for the other $N-k$ elements. We know that they cannot contain a single unique element, thus we have $u_{N-k,t-k}$ choices. All in all, we have: $$u_{N, t}=N^t-\sum_{k=1}^t\binom{t}{k}\frac{N!}{(N-k)!}u_{N-k, t-k}$$ However: I'm not sure this formula is correct: for $t=1$ and $t=2$ there are some corner cases that make it most likely wrong (we don't get $0$ and $N$ respectively), but it might work for $t\geqslant3$ For large values of $N$ , this can be quite tedious to compute (dynamic programming?) I would especially be interested in a closed-form for $u_{N, t}$ (or at least some asymptotic behavior for $t=o(N)$ ) Is there any clever way to compute this quantity that I missed?","I'm trying to compute the number of -tuples such that no element appears exactly once in the tuple, and each element can take values from .

95,"Coin weighing puzzle: one heavy coin, one light coin, which together weigh the same as two normal coins","Coin weighing puzzle: one heavy coin, one light coin, which together weigh the same as two normal coins",,"My question was inspired by this previous question . There are $c = 3^k$ coins where $k \ge 2$ .  Among these coins: $c-2$ of them are good and weigh the same. The remaining $2$ coins are bad : one of them is heavier than a good coin, and the other is lighter than a good coin. The problem is to identify both bad coins (including which is heavy, which is light) using weighings on a balance. Importantly (and unlike the previous question): the two bad coins together weigh the same as two good coins. I.e., if the two bad coins are on one side of a weighing, and two good coins are on the other side, then the result would be balanced. There are $c(c-1)$ possible solutions. Since $3^{2k-1} = c(c/3) < c(c-1) < c^2 = 3^{2k}$ , we know that $2k$ weighings are necessary. My question: Are $2k$ weighings sufficient? I have a solution for $c = 9$ , where indeed $2k = 4$ weighings are sufficient.
