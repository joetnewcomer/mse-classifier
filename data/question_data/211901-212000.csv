0,Optimization and Postage Stamp Problem,Optimization and Postage Stamp Problem,,"(1) Given the set U = {1, 2, 3, ..., 98, 99, 100} of Natural numbers, find the smallest subset S contained in U that: For every element v belonging to U, there are a, b elements of S, not necessarily distinct, such that v = a + b or v = a. S is smallest in having the least number of elements. Example: T = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90} T has 18 elements. Any Natural number v such that 1 <= v <= 100 can be expressed as a sum of 2 elements of T. For instance, 19 = 9 + 10, 40 = 20 + 20 or 40 = 40 This problem seems to my mind to be related to the ""postage stamp problem"" in which we have an envelope that has space for 1 or 2 stamps and we wish to find the smallest set of positive stamp values between 1 and 100 so we can affix any postage between 1 and 100 on the envelope. It seems beguilingly simple but I am not satisfied with the heuristic problem solving I have applied to it. I have constructed sets as follows: S(n) = {1, ..., n, 2n+1, 3n+2, ..., kn + (k-1)} 1 <= n <= 100 and 2 <= k <= m, k = 1, 2, ..., m m = smallest k of { kn + (k-1) + n >= 100 : k = 1, 2, 3, ...} All these sets have a minimum of 18 elements.

I know that since $q_i$ is prime, it cannot divide $q_i$ unless $p=q_i$ for some $1 ≤ i ≤ s$. I'm just not sure how to formulate the proof. Usually with Induction I can set some property $P(n)$ and test it is true for some base like $P(0)$ or $P(1)$ for the base step. I'm unsure how to go about it here.",,"['elementary-number-theory', 'discrete-mathematics', 'prime-numbers', 'induction']"

Here is a theorem, the proof was left as an exercise in my textbook which I think I proved correctly, and I would like to use the result to solve this problem. Theorem: Let $G$ be a group of permutations of $X$ and suppose that u belongs to $G(x\to y)$. Then $$G(x\to y)=uG_x\text{ (where } G_x \text{ is the stabilizer)}$$ the left coset of $G_x$, with respect to u. Since $u$ has an inverse I can rearrange the equation $F(u)=u^{-1}G(x\to y)$. In my case: $F(u)$ is the theorems $G_x$... So let's take $F(1)$ as the first example. If what I am saying is right, then $F(1)=G(x\to y)$ and $|F(1)|=81$? That is, the elements of F(1) is $\{(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(0,4),...,(8,0),(8,1),...,(8,7),(8,8)\}$. This feels kinda wrong to me the more I think about it though. If i do the same for $F(2)$ I find that it's inverse is 5 (usually I make use of the euclidian algorithm to find the inverse but here I could easily see that 5 is the inverse of 2) and $|F(2)|=3*3=9$ and the elements are given by $F(2)=\{(0,0),(0,5),(0,1),(5,0),(5,5),(5,1),(1,0),(1,5),(1,1),\}$. Just in case I have misunderstood this totally, I will explain my calculations for some of the elements in $F(2)$. I start off with $u^{-1}(x,y)=5(x,y)$. The first thing I do is to put $x=y=0$ and then I see $5(0,0)=(5*0,5*0)=(0,0)$ then i continue with $x=0,y=1$ which gives me $5(0,1)=(5,0)$ and lastly $5(0,2)=(0,10)\equiv (0,1) \text{ (mod 9)}$ and since I now see a repeating pattern, $x=0,y=1$ will be the same as $x=0, y=3$, I have found my first 3 elements for $F(2)$. I will see the same pattern for $x=1$ and $x=2$ and by this procedure I will find all 9 elements. The more I think about it the more unsure I become of this method.

I was wondering if, seeing as 27 is a much nicer number to deal with, you could use the inclusion-exclusion principle to find x1+x2+x3+x4=27 such that 150/25 <= xi <= 200/25 and then multiply this answer by C(675+25-1,24)? Can I have some guidance please? I am also open to use of other methods! Thank you in advance!",,"['discrete-mathematics', 'combinations', 'inclusion-exclusion']"

44,Orbital dimension of the action of $S_n$ on 2-subsets,Orbital dimension of the action of  on 2-subsets,S_n,"I have a question on a proof in a paper on the orbital dimension of a permutation group. Let $G \le S^\Omega$ be a permutation group. A base for $G$ is a subset $\Sigma \subseteq \Omega$ for which the pointwise stabilizer $G_{(\Sigma)}$ is the identity.  The base size of $G$, denoted $b(G)$, is the smallest size of a base for $G$. Suppose $G$ has orbitals $\{R_1,\ldots,R_t\}$ (these are the $G$-orbits on $\Omega \times \Omega$).   Define the color $C(x,y)$ of an ordered pair $(x,y) \in \Omega \times \Omega$ to be the value of $i$ for which $(x,y) \in R_i$.  A resolving set for $G$ is a subset $S = \{x_1,\ldots,x_k\} \subseteq \Omega$ such that for any $y,z \in \Omega, y \ne z$, we have $C(y,x_i) \ne C(z,x_i)$ for some $x_i \in S$.  The orbital dimension of $G$, denoted $\mu(G)$, is defined to be the smallest size of a resolving set for $G$.  It can be shown that every resolving set for $G$ is a base for $G$, whence $b(G) \le \mu(G)$.

Is this what was assumed implicitly in the proof?","I have a question on a proof in a paper on the orbital dimension of a permutation group. Let $G \le S^\Omega$ be a permutation group. A base for $G$ is a subset $\Sigma \subseteq \Omega$ for which the pointwise stabilizer $G_{(\Sigma)}$ is the identity.  The base size of $G$, denoted $b(G)$, is the smallest size of a base for $G$. Suppose $G$ has orbitals $\{R_1,\ldots,R_t\}$ (these are the $G$-orbits on $\Omega \times \Omega$).   Define the color $C(x,y)$ of an ordered pair $(x,y) \in \Omega \times \Omega$ to be the value of $i$ for which $(x,y) \in R_i$.  A resolving set for $G$ is a subset $S = \{x_1,\ldots,x_k\} \subseteq \Omega$ such that for any $y,z \in \Omega, y \ne z$, we have $C(y,x_i) \ne C(z,x_i)$ for some $x_i \in S$.  The orbital dimension of $G$, denoted $\mu(G)$, is defined to be the smallest size of a resolving set for $G$.  It can be shown that every resolving set for $G$ is a base for $G$, whence $b(G) \le \mu(G)$.

90,Correctness of counting with product of generating functions,Correctness of counting with product of generating functions,,"In generating functions we can related the coefficients of the generating function with as sequence. $$f(x) = \sum^{\infty}_{n=0}f_nx^n$$ and the sequence that corresponds to it: $$( \ f_0 \ , \ f_1 \ , \ f_2 \ , \ ... \ , \ f_n \ , \ ...)$$ and these coefficients might be related to some counting problem and its kind of a way to ""organize"" the counting of some set. Now when we consider the product of two generating functions $A(x)B(x)$. The product can be interpreted the following way: Let $A(x)$ be the generating function for selecting items from set A,   and let $B(x)$ be the generating function for selecting items from set   B. If A and B are disjoint, then the generating function for selecting   items from the union $A \cup B$ is the product $A(x) \cdot B(x) = C(x)$. This is the statement that I am seeking to understand better, either with a proof or an intuitive argument (ideally both). Recall that if the generating function of the product is $C(x) = A(x) \cdot B(x)$, then the coefficients of $C(x)$ is the convolution: $$c_n = \sum^{n}_{j=0} a_j b_{n-j}$$ What is incredible for me is that the convolution rule for counting, remains valid for many interpretation of ""selection"" (selection, as in the paragraph). I want to understand what are the limits of this word ""select"" and why. Also for two sets of objects we are interested in counting, say coefficients for$a_n$ and $b_n$, might have different combinatorial interpretations for the word ""select"", right? If the interpretation of the word select is different, does the product of the generating functions still hold as a valid method for computing mountings of the union of A and B? i.e. when we use the word select for counting things in $a_n$ and $b_n$, if the word select mean different things for $a_n$ and $b_n$, does $c_n$ still count the intended arrangements of objects? For example, I was told that, we could insist that distinct items be selected or we might allow the same item to be picked a limited number of times or any number of times. However, there are only 2 restrictions for our convolution coefficients to yield correct counting numbers and these are: the order in which items are selected is disregarded. restrictions on the selection of items from sets A and B also apply in selecting items from $A \cup B$. Why do we need those two rules to ensure the correctness that $c_n$ counts the number of ways to select n items from $A \cup B$? I was told that these two restrictions can be equivalently expressed as follows: Formally, there must be a bijection between n-element selections from   $A \cup B$ and ordered pairs of selections from A and B containing a total   of n elements. I was having trouble understanding how those two statements are related and thus, why the restrictions correspond to that bijection. Once we have those restrictions and we understand them, as far as I know the following sum gives the desired count.  If we let $c_n$ is the number of ways to select n items from $A \cup B$, then (for some reason) we observe that we can select n items by choosing j items from A and n - j items from B, where j is any number from 0 to n. This can be done in $a_j b_{n-j}$ ways. Summing over all the possible values of j gives a total of: $$c_n = \sum^{n}_{j=0} a_j b_{n-j}$$ ways to select n items from $A \cup B$. I was unsure why that was the case and how it would break if the conditions that were pre specified would break it. Why does the convolution give indeed the correct count?

Now when we consider the product of two generating functions $A(x)B(x)$. The product can be interpreted the following way: Let $A(x)$ be the generating function for selecting items from set A,   and let $B(x)$ be the generating function for selecting items from set   B. If A and B are disjoint, then the generating function for selecting   items from the union $A \cup B$ is the product $A(x) \cdot B(x) = C(x)$. This is the statement that I am seeking to understand better, either with a proof or an intuitive argument (ideally both). Recall that if the generating function of the product is $C(x) = A(x) \cdot B(x)$, then the coefficients of $C(x)$ is the convolution: $$c_n = \sum^{n}_{j=0} a_j b_{n-j}$$ What is incredible for me is that the convolution rule for counting, remains valid for many interpretation of ""selection"" (selection, as in the paragraph). I want to understand what are the limits of this word ""select"" and why. Also for two sets of objects we are interested in counting, say coefficients for$a_n$ and $b_n$, might have different combinatorial interpretations for the word ""select"", right? If the interpretation of the word select is different, does the product of the generating functions still hold as a valid method for computing mountings of the union of A and B? i.e. when we use the word select for counting things in $a_n$ and $b_n$, if the word select mean different things for $a_n$ and $b_n$, does $c_n$ still count the intended arrangements of objects? For example, I was told that, we could insist that distinct items be selected or we might allow the same item to be picked a limited number of times or any number of times. However, there are only 2 restrictions for our convolution coefficients to yield correct counting numbers and these are: the order in which items are selected is disregarded. restrictions on the selection of items from sets A and B also apply in selecting items from $A \cup B$. Why do we need those two rules to ensure the correctness that $c_n$ counts the number of ways to select n items from $A \cup B$? I was told that these two restrictions can be equivalently expressed as follows: Formally, there must be a bijection between n-element selections from   $A \cup B$ and ordered pairs of selections from A and B containing a total   of n elements. I was having trouble understanding how those two statements are related and thus, why the restrictions correspond to that bijection. Once we have those restrictions and we understand them, as far as I know the following sum gives the desired count.  If we let $c_n$ is the number of ways to select n items from $A \cup B$, then (for some reason) we observe that we can select n items by choosing j items from A and n - j items from B, where j is any number from 0 to n. This can be done in $a_j b_{n-j}$ ways. Summing over all the possible values of j gives a total of: $$c_n = \sum^{n}_{j=0} a_j b_{n-j}$$ ways to select n items from $A \cup B$.

I need to determine if R is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. A relation is reflexive if, and only if, xRx for all elements x in S, correct? So there is only one tuple where x relates to itself, so R is not reflexive A relation is symmetric if, and only if, if xRy then yRx for all (x,y) pairs in S, correct? In this relation, there are no instances where x relates to y and y relates to x, so R is not symmetric A relation is transitive if, and only if, xRy and yRz then xRz for all x,y,z pairs in S, correct? This relation has one instance of transitivity, where 3R4 and 4R2 then 3R2, but transitivity doesn't hold true for all pairs (pairs including 1), so R is not transitive ? 2) There is a set S = {all real numbers}, and a relation R defined by: R is the set of all ordered pairs (x,y) such that x and y are real numbers, 1 < x < 2 AND x = y. I need to determine if R is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. Since, by definition of R, x = y wouldn't that mean that every (x,y) tuple that would be part of R would contain an x and y such that x = y, so the elements would relate to themselves? So they would be reflexive. But this relation is also limited to 1 < x <2. So this relation obviously doesn't hold all possible ordered pairs possible in the set of real numbers. So I would say that R is not reflexive . Is that correct reasoning? By definition of R, I know that x = y so y = x, so the proposition if xRy then yRx would be true in this case. So I would think that R is symmetric , but I don't know how the stipulation 1 < x <2 plays into this. Also, This relation won't have every ordered pair in S, so would that mean it's not symmetric?
