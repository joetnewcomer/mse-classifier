18,What is the reason for the conventions used by modulus notation?,What is the reason for the conventions used by modulus notation?,,"Apologies in advance for what I anticipate will be a very dumb question. To give some background: I am a software architect that’s been programming since the age of 8 and professionally for the last 15 years. Never had any formal university-level training; everything I know is self taught. As such, there are unorthodox gaps in my knowledge; for example, I have in-depth knowledge of subjects like set theory or statistics (given that I primarily work on business software), but when it comes to something like calculus the extent of my knowledge is that it exists and that it’s used in advanced graphics. However, now my career may take a turn to where I need an in-depth understanding of crypthography (on a mathematical / theoretical level). So, here I am in my 30’s going back to the roots and learning abstract, theoretical math & comp sci. I’ve hired a tutor for the purpose, who is an undergrad student in a comp sci program that’s known for being very theory-focused. The question: Recently, he started teaching me modular notation. Being a software engineer, I am obviously deeply familiar with the modulus operator, and in the world of programming we use the % operator for the purpose. I.e. 3 % 5 = 3 . However, I was told that in mathematics, the notation is to arbitrarily add mod X to the end of an equation/problem block. So, everything is written as usual and there is a note at the end of the equation/problem specifying “under what modulus” everything in the problem is. This makes no sense to me whatsoever, and when I asked my tutor he said that he asked the same question in his class and the professor replied that “it’s just the way it’s done”. I understand that conventions can be unique, but this to me feels like a very radical departure from the way math is usually written down, and because of that — I feel like there has to be an underlying reason for it that I am not seeing… I am hoping that someone much more knowledgeable than me can help clarify my few questions and help it all make sense. Math is typically written left to right, with parenthesis and/or other symbols defining blocks/scopes. For example, the body of a square root can include massive formulas, but the scope of the square root is still visually defined. Same with parenthesis blocks and global operations done upon the entire block. Numbers and operations also follow in sequence, which have a value that they act on and an argument. For example, to get a sum of 4 numbers, we would write (2+5+7+8) (three individual operations), not (2,5,7,8 +) (apply this operator on all numbers in the set). But with the mod operator, it seems like it’s an arbitrarily-placed footnote at the end of a block, which on top of everything contains extremely vital information. There is no purpose to reading whatever formula is inside the block without first knowing “under what modulus” it is, so how does this work out in academia with page-long formulas? How exactly does scoping work? From my understanding, all of the below is syntactically legal: 3x = 15y mod 5 (2x + 8y) - 12z mod 5 (2x + 8y)(12z - 5x) mod 5 What happens if my problem is using a different modulus/base for different parts of the problem? Would this be legal? (3x + 4y mod 5) - (8z - 2a mod 8) ? What if I have nested clauses? I.e. (3x + (2a - 2b mod 7)^2 + 4y mod 5) - 17z mod 3 ?

However, now my career may take a turn to where I need an in-depth understanding of crypthography (on a mathematical / theoretical level). So, here I am in my 30’s going back to the roots and learning abstract, theoretical math & comp sci. I’ve hired a tutor for the purpose, who is an undergrad student in a comp sci program that’s known for being very theory-focused. The question: Recently, he started teaching me modular notation. Being a software engineer, I am obviously deeply familiar with the modulus operator, and in the world of programming we use the % operator for the purpose. I.e. 3 % 5 = 3 . However, I was told that in mathematics, the notation is to arbitrarily add mod X to the end of an equation/problem block. So, everything is written as usual and there is a note at the end of the equation/problem specifying “under what modulus” everything in the problem is. This makes no sense to me whatsoever, and when I asked my tutor he said that he asked the same question in his class and the professor replied that “it’s just the way it’s done”. I understand that conventions can be unique, but this to me feels like a very radical departure from the way math is usually written down, and because of that — I feel like there has to be an underlying reason for it that I am not seeing… I am hoping that someone much more knowledgeable than me can help clarify my few questions and help it all make sense. Math is typically written left to right, with parenthesis and/or other symbols defining blocks/scopes. For example, the body of a square root can include massive formulas, but the scope of the square root is still visually defined. Same with parenthesis blocks and global operations done upon the entire block. Numbers and operations also follow in sequence, which have a value that they act on and an argument. For example, to get a sum of 4 numbers, we would write (2+5+7+8) (three individual operations), not (2,5,7,8 +) (apply this operator on all numbers in the set). But with the mod operator, it seems like it’s an arbitrarily-placed footnote at the end of a block, which on top of everything contains extremely vital information. There is no purpose to reading whatever formula is inside the block without first knowing “under what modulus” it is, so how does this work out in academia with page-long formulas? How exactly does scoping work? From my understanding, all of the below is syntactically legal: 3x = 15y mod 5 (2x + 8y) - 12z mod 5 (2x + 8y)(12z - 5x) mod 5 What happens if my problem is using a different modulus/base for different parts of the problem? Would this be legal? (3x + 4y mod 5) - (8z - 2a mod 8) ? What if I have nested clauses? I.e. (3x + (2a - 2b mod 7)^2 + 4y mod 5) - 17z mod 3 ? Thanks so much in advance to whoever can help me make sense of this system!",,"['number-theory', 'elementary-number-theory', 'notation', 'modular-arithmetic']"

20,Proof of obtaining multiple of 10 by using arithmetic operations on any three numbers,Proof of obtaining multiple of 10 by using arithmetic operations on any three numbers,,"While doing a few math puzzles I noted that you could take any three numbers (integers) and use basic arithmetic operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Parentheses only) to obtain a multiple of 10, using each number only once. Eg. Using 29, 73, 36: $73+36-29=80$ Using 2, 4, 7: $2*7-4=10$ Is there a proof for this theory in particular, or is there a more general theorem that applies to this? If not, is there a set of three numbers which disproves this theory? I found a few clues while solving this: If one of the numbers is a multiple of 5 (call it $x$) then there definitely exists a solution divisible by 10. This one is easily provable as you merely need an even number to multiply with. If any one of the remaining two numbers is even, you can use that to multiply with $x$ to get number divisible by 10. If both numbers are odd then you can add them to get an even number to multiply with $x$. It would seem as only the units place digits have any bearing on whether it's a multiple of 10 or not. As you could take any of the examples, add or subtract any multiple of 10 from it and do the same operations to still get a multiple of ten. I feel this is also easily provable but I can't think of a way to do it which isn't long-winded. EDIT: It can be proven as such, let $a,b$ be two integers s.t $a+b|10$ Adding two multiples of 10 ($10m,10n$) to $a$ and $b$ we get $10m+a+10n+b$ Since $a+b|10$ it can be written as $10m+10n+10k$ where $a+b=10k$ Which is divisible by ten Now let $a,b$ be two integers s.t. $a.b|10$ Adding $10m,10n$ to $a$ and $b$ we get $(10m+a)(10n+b)$ $=100mn+10an+10bm+ab$ or $100mn+10an+10bm+10k$ Which is divisible by ten Therefore any combination of Addition and Multiplication with the three no.s shouldn't matter. I realise that could replace 10 with any no. in this proof and it would still work. So we really need to just prove for every single digit no. I ran a program in python that checked for every combination of single digit no.s, but it didn't find any combination that disproves this.

We express the two rational solutions as following: $$y=\frac{n_1}{m_1},\frac{n_2}{m_2},\ \ \ \ where \ m_i\in\mathbb{N},\ n_i\in\mathbb{Z},\ gcd(m_i,n_i)=1,\ (i=1,2)$$ From the factor theorem and $gcd(Y,Y+1)=1$ , we can get the following relation. $$(m_1y-n_1)(m_2y-n_2)=Yy^2+(Y+1)y+Y\alpha-x$$ $$m_1m_2y^2-(m_1n_2+m_2n_1)y+n_1n_2=Yy^2+(Y+1)y+Y\alpha-x$$ Hence \begin{eqnarray*}    m_1m_2 &=& Y \\    -(m_1n_2+m_2n_1) &=& Y+1 \\    n_1n_2 &=& Y\alpha-x \end{eqnarray*} So we can get $$x=m_1m_2\alpha-n_1n_2$$ $$m_1n_2+m_2n_1+m_1m_2=-1.$$ We combine the two equation as following: $$x=\frac{n_1n_2-m_1m_2\alpha}{m_1n_2+m_2n_1+m_1m_2}$$ We enter this $x$ into $x^2+x+\alpha$ and calculate the factorization. We can get $$x^2+x+\alpha = \frac{(n_1^2+m_1n_1+\alpha m_1^2)(n_2^2+m_2n_2+\alpha m_2^2)}{(m_1n_2+m_2n_1+m_1m_2)^2}.$$ Since $\ m_1n_2+m_2n_1+m_1m_2=-1$ , $$x^2+x+\alpha = (n_1^2+m_1n_1+\alpha m_1^2)(n_2^2+m_2n_2+\alpha m_2^2).$$ So $x^2+x+\alpha$ is a composite number. $$\tag*{$\square$}$$ Since $y=\frac{-Y-1 \pm \sqrt{(1-4\alpha)Y^2+2(2x+1)Y+1}}{2Y}$ , we can get a condition from Theorem 1. Lemma. $\forall x,\alpha \in \mathbb{N}$ , The ellipse $$X^2 = (1-4\alpha)Y^2+2(2x+1)Y+1, \ \ \ \ \ \ Y>0$$ has lattice points $(X,Y)$ . $\Rightarrow$ $y$ is a rational number. If $Y=0$ is allowed, the ellipse has always $(X,Y) = (\pm 1,0)\ \ $ (trivial lattice points). Hence, the following assertion is correct. Theorem 2. $\forall x,\alpha \in \mathbb{N}, \alpha \neq 1$ , The ellipse has one or more non-trivial lattice points. $\Rightarrow x^2+x+\alpha$ is a composite number. The following conjecture is unresolved. Conjecture. $\forall x \in \mathbb{N} ,\ \forall \alpha \in \{3,5,11,17,41\} $ , The ellipse has only trivial lattice points. $\Leftrightarrow x^2+x+\alpha$ is a prime number. (The ellipse has one or more non-trivial lattice points. $\Leftrightarrow x^2+x+\alpha$ is a composite number.) If this conjecture is correct , the number of lattice points and the number of divisors are equal.","I anticipate that the number of lattice points of a special ellipse will be equal to the number of divisors of a number represented by Euler's prime generating polynomial. Euler's prime generating polynomial: Special ellipse: For example, let be 40. Euler's prime generating polynomial: The number of divisors of is equal to 3.

Theorem 1. , The equation has rational solution and natural number solution is a composite number. Proof. We express the two rational solutions as following: From the factor theorem and , we can get the following relation.
