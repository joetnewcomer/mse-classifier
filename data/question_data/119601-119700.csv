15,Why don't these hexagons tile seamlessly-- without space in between? Where in my math have I gone silly?,Why don't these hexagons tile seamlessly-- without space in between? Where in my math have I gone silly?,,"Intro to the Problem Hi there! I've been trying to seamlessly tile hexagons on an XY plane-- without spaces in between. I've currently accomplished this , however: which as you can tell, isn't seamless or uniform in spacing. What I'd like answered here is, where in my math have I veered off track, for my result not to match what I desire? Why does the distance between the hexagons vary instead of being constantly zero? If you can't answer that because I've failed to communicate my process effectively, how would you go about tiling hexagons on an XY plane to achieve the desired result? The Math Behind the Tiling In order to tile regular hexagons as in the desired seamless result, I took the approach of stacking hexagons in radial layers. Starting with a center hexagon ( L0 ), I'd surround it with a layer ( L1 ) of hexagons, then I'd surround L1 with L2 of hexagons, and so on. My ultimate question regarding said radial stacking approach was: what's the distance and the angle from the center of the starting hexagon ( L0 ) to the center of any other hexagon in the tessellation? Knowing such an angle and distance, I could radially plot each hexagon from the center of the tessellation. By analyzing the case of circles, finding that the centers of two similar bitangent circles are a distance of twice their radius apart, I figured that the centers of two similar regular hexagons are a distance of twice their radius apart-- only, the radius of a hexagon changes; it isn't constant. Here's a GeoGebra diagram demonstrating how I found the radius of a hexagon-- or the distance from its center to its perimeter, given an angle: Distance from the center of a hexagon to its perimeter, at angle theta . Because this radius repeats every PI/3, or TAU/6 radians, the input angle for which to calculate a radius can be modulated by PI/3, such that it becomes ( angle MOD PI/3 ). For a regular polygon with n sides, the input angle with which to find a radius can be modulated by TAU/n radians. I also graphed my derived equations in Desmos: Desmos graph of n-sided regular polygon . They seem to check out. Once I'd found the radius of a hexagon at an angle, I postulated that to find the coordinates of the center of another hexagon, say from origin L0 to a hexagon in set L1 , I simply had to find the angle between the L0 and the next hexagon, find the radius of that angle as a vector, and multiply that radius vector by the layer index + 1 (layer 1 + 1 = 2).

That's all the information I have to give-- I once again ask, why does the distance between the hexagons vary instead of being constantly zero? What would you do differently to achieve a seamless or uniformly spaced hexagonal tesselation?","Intro to the Problem Hi there! I've been trying to seamlessly tile hexagons on an XY plane-- without spaces in between. I've currently accomplished this , however: which as you can tell, isn't seamless or uniform in spacing. What I'd like answered here is, where in my math have I veered off track, for my result not to match what I desire? Why does the distance between the hexagons vary instead of being constantly zero? If you can't answer that because I've failed to communicate my process effectively, how would you go about tiling hexagons on an XY plane to achieve the desired result? The Math Behind the Tiling In order to tile regular hexagons as in the desired seamless result, I took the approach of stacking hexagons in radial layers. Starting with a center hexagon ( L0 ), I'd surround it with a layer ( L1 ) of hexagons, then I'd surround L1 with L2 of hexagons, and so on. My ultimate question regarding said radial stacking approach was: what's the distance and the angle from the center of the starting hexagon ( L0 ) to the center of any other hexagon in the tessellation? Knowing such an angle and distance, I could radially plot each hexagon from the center of the tessellation. By analyzing the case of circles, finding that the centers of two similar bitangent circles are a distance of twice their radius apart, I figured that the centers of two similar regular hexagons are a distance of twice their radius apart-- only, the radius of a hexagon changes; it isn't constant. Here's a GeoGebra diagram demonstrating how I found the radius of a hexagon-- or the distance from its center to its perimeter, given an angle: Distance from the center of a hexagon to its perimeter, at angle theta . Because this radius repeats every PI/3, or TAU/6 radians, the input angle for which to calculate a radius can be modulated by PI/3, such that it becomes ( angle MOD PI/3 ). For a regular polygon with n sides, the input angle with which to find a radius can be modulated by TAU/n radians. I also graphed my derived equations in Desmos: Desmos graph of n-sided regular polygon . They seem to check out. Once I'd found the radius of a hexagon at an angle, I postulated that to find the coordinates of the center of another hexagon, say from origin L0 to a hexagon in set L1 , I simply had to find the angle between the L0 and the next hexagon, find the radius of that angle as a vector, and multiply that radius vector by the layer index + 1 (layer 1 + 1 = 2). For L0 to L2 , I'd multiply said vector by 3, because layer 2 + 1 = 3. Here's a diagram of said vector multiplication in GeoGebra: Distances between hexagon centers .

(5 answers) Closed 3 years ago . I need to know the answer to this question to find out why bees use hexagonal cells in hives. I know that a circle takes up the most area using the least perimeter, so bees would try to make shapes as close to a circle as possible to use the most space without wasting too much material on walls. However, bees don't use circles because using circles creates a lot of waste space between cells, so bees use a shape that can tile a plane without overlap. The shape that meets the conditions of having a lot of sides and being regular to look like a circle, and being able to tile a plane  is the hexagon, so bees use this in their hives. However, I want to know whether or not this is the polygon with the most sides that fits this requirement. I try to prove there is no bigger polygon like this. First, I note that an integer number of interior angles must meet at a site and add up to $360$ degrees to tile a plane. For example, squares can tiles a plane because they all have $90$ degree angles, and $4$ of these make $360$ . All polygons have exterior angles adding up to $360$ , so a polygon with $n$ sides has $\frac{360}n$ degrees per side. However, interior and exterior angles are supplementary, thus the interior angle of an $n$ side polygon measures $180- \frac{360}n$ degrees. Now, let's test whether this quantity divides $360$ degrees. We get $360 \over 180- \frac{360}n$ , which simplifies down to $\frac {2n}{n-2}$ . Now, I need to prove that $n=6$ is the biggest number such that this quanitity is an integer, but I am not sure how I would go about  doing that.","This question already has answers here : Why a tesselation of the plane by a convex polygon of 7 or more sides is not possible?

In order to do this, they'll connect a bunch of bezier curves together to form the clipping path. Rather than have them move the control points of the curves in order to change the curve, I'd like them to be able to move a point on the curve itself. At this point, I'm not set on using quadratic rather than cubic beziers, or vice versa. The rest of this post will discuss the issue from the point of view of quadratic curves, but I would love an answer that provides solutions to both. It seems to me that there are two possible methods for accomplishing this: By determining the relationship between the point on the curve and the true control point.

In order to do this, they'll connect a bunch of bezier curves together to form the clipping path. Rather than have them move the control points of the curves in order to change the curve, I'd like them to be able to move a point on the curve itself. At this point, I'm not set on using quadratic rather than cubic beziers, or vice versa. The rest of this post will discuss the issue from the point of view of quadratic curves, but I would love an answer that provides solutions to both.

What is the supremum of the ratio of their areas?,,"Draw a triangle in the region bounded by a polynomial curve and a straight line. What is the supremum of the ratio of the triangle's area to the region's area? Context I was thinking about the quadrature of the parabola . If we draw a triangle in the region bounded by a parabola and straight line, the maximum ratio of the area of the triangle to the area of the region, is $3/4$ . Then I wondered, if we can replace the parabola with any polynomial curve, what is the maximum or supremum of the ratio? My attempt I assume that one side of the triangle of largest area, is coincident with the straight line that bounds the region. We can assume that the supremum of the ratio can be attained when the straight line is $y=0$ , because if the supremum is attained with polynomial $y=f(x)$ and line $y=mx+c$ , then we can draw a new polynomial $y=f(x)-(mx+c)$ and line $y=0$ , and the ratio will be the same as before. I conjecture that when the supremum is attained or approached, in the region of interest bounded by the curve and line, the leftmost (or rightmost) point is a stationary point of the curve. If this were not true, then it seems like the ratio of areas could be increased by vertically translating the  horizontal line (such that the area of the region increases), which would be a contradiction. I experimented with various polynomials, and so far, the maximum ratio that I've found is approximately $0.8405$ , using the region bounded by $y=-x^2\left(x+\frac23\right)^2(x-1)$ and $y=0$ from $x=0$ to $x=1$ .

Note that this is different from the problem of squaring the circle (which is about compass and straightedge constructions) and also from the Banach-Tarski paradox (which involves a change of volume). Laczkovich showed in 1990 that the answer was yes, and proved the existence of a solution with about $10^{50}$ pieces. The proof was nonconstructive. What is the error in the following proof that the answer to the problem is no, contrary to Laczkovich? At a given stage in the process of cutting and reassembly, let $u$ be the total length of all convex edges that are circular arcs whose radius equals the radius $r$ of the original circle, and similarly let $v$ be the total length of all such concave edges. Initially, $u=2\pi r$ and $v=0$. At the end of the construction, we would have to have $u=v=0$. But $u-v$ is conserved by both cutting and reassembly, so this is impossible.
