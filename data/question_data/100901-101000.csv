1,How does this equation to find the radius from 3 points actually work?,How does this equation to find the radius from 3 points actually work?,,"I had searched online and found an equation that solves the radius of a circle from 3 points that are located on the circumference of that specific circle. Where I had found this formula did not state its derivation or anything of the likes, however it is to find the radius. With the 3 points, you should form a triangle. Let us call this Triangle $ABC$. Using the distance formula, we can calculate the distance between $AB$, $BC$, and $AC$. To simplify things, let us call these distances A, B, and C respectively. We also need the area of the triangle. After finding an altitude of the specified triangle, we can use the area of a triangle equation to solve for it. Let us call the area of this triangle $K$. This is the formula: $r = \dfrac{ABC}{4K}$ Which is essentially saying $radius = \dfrac{\text{Product~of~the~triangle~side~lengths}}{\text{The~area~of~the~triangle~multiplied~by~4}}$ This above pseudo equation was just to clarify the formula, I understand everyone here are exceptional mathematicians, and as I mature, I also hope to become one as well.

In particular, this book by Jurgensen, Brown, and Jurgensen has the following eleven postulates in its first three chapters (I could have them a little off): Ruler Segment addition Protractor Angle addition A line contains two points; a plane contains three noncollinear points; space contains four noncoplanar points Two points define a line Given three points, there exists a plane containing them; three noncollinear points determine a plane If a plane contains two points, then it contains the line connecting them If two planes intersect, their intersection is a line If a transversal crosses parallel lines, then corresponding angles are equal If a transversal crosses two lines and corresponding angles are equal, then the lines are parallel and goes on to state the following theorem without proof: 3-11. If two lines are parallel to a third line, then the lines are parallel. The Question In my tutoring sessions with geometry students, we always use this book because I feel that it's pretty good. But when we get to this point, we go, ""Okay, we're pretty competent at geometry; let's try to prove it."" And we always breeze through the case where the lines are in a plane together, and come up dry in the general case. Looking into Euclid XI tonight, I see that this is the ninth proposition. Its proof uses the sixth: ""If lines make right angles to the same plane, then they are parallel."" This, in turn, uses I.4 (SAS) and I.8 (SSS), which in Jurgensen/Brown/Jurgensen are postulates in the next chapter. So is 3.11 provable from the eleven postulates?

Two lines are parallel if they are coplanar and nonintersecting. A transversal is a line in a plane intersecting two other lines in that plane at different points. A line and a plane are perpendicular if the line is perpendicular to all lines in the plane through the point of intersection.

3,The largest equilateral triangle circumscribing a given triangle,The largest equilateral triangle circumscribing a given triangle,,"Seven years ago, one of my many contributions to the March 2010 edition of Erich Friedman's Math Magic was a packing of eight circles of unit diameter and one equilateral triangle of unit side length into as small a circle as I could manage. To minimise the bounding circle's radius $r$ , I had to determine the largest equilateral triangle externally tangent to the three circles adjacent to it, then numerically adjust $r$ until said triangle had side lengths $1$ . This is not a trivial problem, and back then I did trial and error in GeoGebra. ( $2r=3.4133707107\dots$ ) It is easy to see that the circles can be shrunk and the equilateral triangle enlarged about its centre while preserving tangencies, so the problem is equivalent to finding the largest equilateral triangle $\Delta^*$ where each edge is incident to one of $A,B,C$ where $A,B,C$ are the circle centres. The following construction doesn't count since one edge does not meet $\triangle ABC$ : Now, having reinvigorated my interest in triangles, I believe I have found a construction for $\Delta^*$ for arbitrary $A,B,C$ , and am asking here for a more traditional proof of its optimality. My construction proceeds as follows: Construct the first isogonic centre/Fermat point of the triangle, $X_{13}$ in the Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers (ETC). That is, construct outward equilateral triangles $A'BC, AB'C, ABC'$ on the sides of $\triangle ABC$ , then $X_{13}$ is the concurrence of $AA',BB',CC'$ . $\Delta^*$ is (conjecturally) the antipedal triangle of $X_{13}$ . $^\dagger$ That is, $\Delta^*$ is the triangle formed by perpendiculars at $A,B,C$ of $AX_{13},BX_{13},CX_{13}$ respectively; it is guaranteed to be equilateral because the lines meeting at $X_{13}$ are evenly spaced around it. The centroid of the triangle thus constructed is $X_{5463}$ in the ETC, the reflection of $X_{13}$ in the centroid of $\triangle ABC$ , and its area is $\frac{a^2+b^2+c^2}{2\sqrt3}+2\operatorname{area}(\triangle ABC)$ where $a,b,c$ are the side lengths. (Alternatively, the area is $2\left(1+\frac{\cot\omega}{\sqrt3}\right)\operatorname{area}(\triangle ABC)$ where $\omega$ is the Brocard angle.) How can I prove that my construction actually produces $\Delta^*$ , the largest circumscribing equilateral triangle? $^\dagger$ Without loss of generality, assume $AB$ is the largest side, and let $P,Q$ be the midpoints of $AC',BC'$ respectively. If $\overline{CP}$ or $\overline{CQ}$ is less than $\frac12\overline{AB}$ , my construction will not produce an equilateral triangle actually incident to all of $A,B,C$ . In that case, $\Delta^*$ has a side collinear with the triangle's shortest side $s$ and one vertex coincident with the original triangle's smaller angle incident to $s$ .

And beyond to n-dimensional space?,,"The ""inscribed angle theorem"" is a common 2-dimensional plane geometry fact. It states that for a circle the angle formed between any two points on the circumference with the center is twice the angle formed by those two points with any other point on the circumference.

Wikipedia Article on inscribed angle theorem My question is whether this simple 2D geometric concept can be adapted to solid angles in 3D? And perhaps beyond to n dimensions? The 2D case dealt with 3 points on the circumference of a circle (2 that defined the arc, and the 3rd point that formed the angle that was half the angle at the center). In 3D, imagine a sphere rather than a circle, and consider 4 points instead of 3. Let 3 of the 4 points form the base of a tetrahedron, then consider two distinct cases. In the first case the 4th point forms the tip of the tetrahedron. In the other case the center of the sphere defined by the 4 points forms the tip of the tetrahedron.

My attempt: Orthocenter problem part- edited (old notes deleted to be less chaotic and I believe there is still some space for improvement of the first part): In the meantime, I realized it would be better to just use the condition of tangency and plug some of its parameters into the formula for a line in the $xy$ plane. Let $y=k_ix + l_i,\ i=1,2,3$ be a tangent line to a parabola. Then $$p=2k_il_i\implies l_i=\frac{\frac{p}2}{k_i}$$ Now, our equation becomes: $$\boxed{y=k_ix+\frac{\frac{p}2}{k_i}}$$ We can substitute $\frac{p}2$ by $\alpha$ , so $$\boxed{y=k_ix+\frac{\alpha}{k_i}}$$ This way, our computations are getting easier. The equations of the three arbitrary tangents to a parabola are: $$\begin{aligned}y&=k_1x+\frac{\alpha}{k_1}\\y&=k_2x+\frac{\alpha}{k_2}\\y&=k_3x+\frac{\alpha}{k_3}\end{aligned}$$ The intersection point of the $i-$ th and $j-$ th tangent line: $$k_ix+\frac{\alpha}{k_i}=k_jx+\frac{\alpha}{k_j}\implies x=\alpha\frac{\frac1{k_j}-\frac1{k_i}}{k_i-k_j}=\frac{\alpha}{k_ik_j}$$ $$y=k_i\cdot\frac{\alpha}{k_ik_j}+\frac{\alpha}{k_i}=\alpha\left(\frac1{k_i}+\frac1{k_j}\right)$$ $$\boxed{S_{ij}=\left(\frac{\alpha}{k_ik_j},\alpha\frac{k_i+k_j}{k_ik_j}\right)}$$ Now, we have to find the line perpendicular to the $k-$ th tangent line passing through the point $S_{ij}$ . $k_\perp=-\frac1{k_k}$ E.g., one altitude of the formed triangle belongs to the line: $$\begin{aligned}y-y_{S_{1,2}}&=k_\perp(x-x_{S_{1,2}})\iff &y&=-\frac1{k_3}x+\frac{\alpha}{k_1k_2k_3}+\alpha\left(\frac1{k_1}+\frac1{k_2}\right)\\&&y&=-\frac1{k_3}x+\alpha\left(\frac1{k_1}+\frac1{k_2}+\frac1{k_1k_2k_3}\right)\end{aligned}$$ So, the $x$ coordinate of the intersection of the three tangent lines: $$\begin{aligned}y&=-\frac1{k_3}x+\alpha\left(\frac1{k_1}+\frac1{k_2}+\frac1{k_1k_2k_3}\right)\\y&=-\frac1{k_2}x+\alpha\left(\frac1{k_1}+\frac1{k_3}+\frac1{k_1k_2k_3}\right)\\y&=-\frac1{k_1}x+\alpha\left(\frac1{k_2}+\frac1{k_3}+\frac1{k_1k_2k_3}\right)\end{aligned}$$ $$\begin{aligned}-\frac1{k_3}x+\alpha\left(\frac1{k_1}+\frac1{k_2}+\frac1{k_1k_2k_3}\right)&=-\frac1{k_2}x+\alpha\left(\frac1{k_1}+\frac1{k_3}+\frac1{k_1k_2k_3}\right)\\\left(\frac1{k_2}-\frac1{k_3}\right)x&=\left(\frac1{k_3}-\frac1{k_2}\right)\alpha\\x&=-\alpha=-\frac{p}2\end{aligned}$$ End of the first part.

The rails are parallel, but they appear to converge as they recede into the distance. Is there any curve that the two rails could follow such that they appear parallel out to the horizon instead of appearing to converge? My best guess would be that to appear parallel the apparent distance between the curves must remain constant. For that to be the case, it seems like two diverging lines would suffice since the length of the horizon ought to grow linearly with distance from the observer - meaning the space between the lines ought to grow linearly as well to maintain a constant proportion of the horizon.

The particular case was related to my own research, and the existence of a parametrization and a closed form solution for the area is quite helpful. I have therefore decided to award the bounty to Anıl. I would also like to thank all who have participated in the dicussion. The general question however is still open, and hence there are no ""accepted answers.""",,['geometry']

27,Can we find a function that finds the number of points inside a square centred on the origin?,Can we find a function that finds the number of points inside a square centred on the origin?,,"This question was inspired from this problem . For this problem, the radius of a square will be the distance from its centre to   any of its four vertices. A lattice point is a point $(a, b)$ in the plane where $a$ and $b$ are both integers. Find a function $f$ on the positive real numbers so that $f(r)$ is the largest   possible number of lattice points inside any square of radius $r$ centred at the   origin. A point on the perimeter is considered to be inside the square. I misread the problem linked above and was trying to solve this question. I tried writing down the values of $f(r)$ depending on the value of $r$ . For example, when $1 \le r <\sqrt 2, f(r)=5$ and when $\sqrt 2 \le r < 2, f(r)=9$ . Next, I tried to focus only on the lower bounds, where the square's corners fall on boundary points. I could see that $r$ was of the form $\sqrt {a^2+b^2}$ so maybe I could try a function involving a lower bound. When the square's vertices fall on lattice points, we can use Pick's theorem to calculate the area. Here, $i$ means the number of interior points and $b$ means the number of boundary points. According to Pick's theorem, $A=\frac 12b + i-1$ However, as it is a square with diagonal $2r$ , $A=2r^2$ $2r^2=\frac 12b + i-1$ We know that $f(r)=b+i$ when $r$ is such that the square has lattice points as vertices. So: $f(r)=4r^2+1-i$ or $f(r)=4r^2+b+1$ I could not progress any further. I thought I could form a relationship between the current square and the next largest square because $f\left(r_{\text{Current Square}}\right)=4r^2+1-f\left(r_{\text{Next Largest Square}}\right)$ but I am finding it difficult to define how we can get from a square to the next largest/smallest one.

Let $f:A \subseteq \mathbb{S}^n \to \mathbb{S}^n$ be a map which strictly decreases distances, i.e $$d(f(x),f(y)) <d(x,y) \, \text{  for every } x,y \in A.$$ ($d$ can be either the intrinsic distance or the Euclidean one, it does not matter) Is it true that $f(A)$ is contained in the interior of some hemisphere? Is it contained in a disk with (intrinsic) radius $\frac{\pi}{2}-\epsilon$ for some $\epsilon$? Edit: It turns out that $f(A)$ is not necessarily contained in a disk with radius $\frac{\pi}{2}-\epsilon$. George Lowther gave the following nice example: Fix a meridian line joining north and south poles on the sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$. Let $f:\mathbb{S}^2 \to \mathbb{S}^2$ map each point to the unique point on the meridian with the same latitude. Then $f$ strictly reduces the distance between any two points which do not have the same longitude*. Let $A$ be any set containing points arbitrarily close (but not equal) to both the north and south poles, all of which have distinct longitudes. Restricting  $f$ to $A$ gives the counterexample: Indeed, $f(A)$ contains points on a great semi-circle (the fixed meridian) which are arbitrarily close to the north and south pole. If $f(A)$ was contained in a disk of radius $\frac{\pi}{2}-\epsilon$, then by triangle inequality the distance of every two points in it would be less than or equal to $\pi-2\epsilon$, a contradiction. Note however that $f(A)$ does lie in the interior of a hemisphere -look at the hemisphere centered in the middle point of the meridian , and recall the north and south poles were left out from $A$, and hence also from $f(A)$. Finally, if we try to include one of the poles in $A$, in an attempt to produce a counter-example for the weaker conjecture, we will destroy the strict distance decreasing property of $f$. (Distance of a point to the pole depends only on the latitude). *The fact that $f$ is strictly decreasing distance between points which do not have the same longitude follows immediately from the formula for the spherical distance: $\Delta\sigma=\arccos\bigl(\sin\phi_1\cdot\sin\phi_2+\cos\phi_1\cdot\cos\phi_2\cdot\cos(\Delta\lambda)\bigr)$ Partial Results: An argument here (pg 7, lemma 2.8), shows that the convex hull of $f(A)$ does not contain the origin. Hence, $\, f(A)$ is contained in a closed hemisphere. (This follows from the hyperplane separation theorem). Moreover, if $A \subseteq \mathbb{S}^n $ is compact then the answer is positive : Since $f(A)$ is compact, $\operatorname{conv}(f(A))$ is compact. Any closed convex set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ which does not contain the origin $\bar O$, is contained in a closed half-space which does not contain $\bar O$ (by the strong hyperplane separation theorem). In particular, $\operatorname{conv}(f(A))$ is contained in the interior of a half-space whose boundary does contain $\bar O$, so $f(A)$ is contained in the interior of a hemisphere. Thus, if $A$ is not closed, a naive approach would be to try to extend it to the closure of $A$.

54,New Proof of Pythagorean Theorem (using inscribed circle)?,New Proof of Pythagorean Theorem (using inscribed circle)?,,"I was solving an easy problem for fun when I stumbled onto this, and was wondering if this was a correct and possibly a new proof of the Pythagorean Theorem. Given right triangle $\triangle ABC$, and side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$.  Inscribe in  $\triangle ABC$ a circle, which has radius $r$, and origin point $O$.  Connect $O$ to vertices $A$, $B$ and $C$, such that you form $\overline{AO}$, $\overline{BO}$, and $\overline{CO}$.  This creates three trianlges: $\triangle ABO$, $\triangle BCO$, and $\triangle ACO$.  Obviously the area of these three new triangles equals that of $\triangle ABC$.

63,Intuitive explanation of CDF of a Binomial distribution in the volume of a Hyperspherical Cap,Intuitive explanation of CDF of a Binomial distribution in the volume of a Hyperspherical Cap,,"Note: This is my first question ever in stackexchange, I apologize for any mistakes in formatting, on the appropriateness of the question and tags. From Wikipedia, I know the regularized incomplete beta function is related to the CDF of a random variable $X$ from a Binomial distribution: $$\mathcal{F} \left(k; n, p\right) = 1 - I_{p} \left( k+1, n-k \right). $$ ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_function#Incomplete_beta_function ) Also from Wikipedia, the expression of a hyperspherical cap in $D$ dimensions is given by $$ V_{D\text{-cap}} = \frac{1}{2}V_{D\text{-ball}} \, I_{(2Rh-h^2)/R^2} \left(\frac{D+1}{2}, \frac{1}{2} \right),$$ where $V_{D\text{-ball}}$ is the the volume of the the $D$ -ball with radius $R$ and $h$ is its height. ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_cap ) I re-expressed the previous expression to incorporate heights larger than $R$ and considered the cap is cut at the hyperplane $x=0$ and the ball is centered at $x=x_0$ ( See image ). Then, $R = h-x_0$ , and $$ \frac{V_{D\text{-cap}} (x_0)}{V_{D\text{-ball}}} = -\frac{1}{2} \text{sgn}\left(\frac{x_0}{R} \right) I_{1-\left( \frac{x_0}{R} \right)^2} \left( \frac{D+1}{2}, \frac{1}{2} \right) + \Theta \left(\frac{x_0}{R}\right),$$ where $\text{sgn}(x)$ is the sign operator, $I_x \left(a,b \right)$ the regularized incomplete beta function and $\Theta(x)$ the Heaviside function. Considering the property from point 1 and $\Theta (x) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \text{sgn} (x)$ , this can be re-expressed as: $$\frac{V_{D\text{-cap}} (x_0)}{V_{D\text{-ball}}} =\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \text{sgn}\left(\frac{x_0}{R}\right) \mathcal{F} \left( \frac{D-1}{2}; \frac{D}{2}, 1-\left( \frac{x_0}{R} \right)^2 \right).$$ So here comes my question: What is the meaning of the CDF of the Binomial distribution in this context?

For odd $D$ the Binomial CDF appears to not be defined, I guess a fractional number of experiments $n$ is not well-defined; and for even $D$ the two sides give different values, I imagine a fractional number of successes $k$ is neither well-defined.

Let the number of whole pieces removed from the bar—out of the ten pieces labeled 1 to 10 below—be $n$ and let the number written on the last piece removed be $x.$ What is $nx?$ Details and Assumptions: • At the start, the sloping cut passes through the bottom right corner of piece 9, so that all the pieces below it stays the same each time the cut pieces are reassembled. • Each reassembly is done with 3 cut pieces (out of 4), as in the animation, along and above the red, dotted line.

86,Why is the volume of a cone not half the volume of the cylinder of which it is a part?,Why is the volume of a cone not half the volume of the cylinder of which it is a part?,,"Now I'm aware of the proof for the volume of a cone being a third of the volume of the corresponding cylinder and the proof is satisfactory. Here's an alternate approach that seems to imply that the volume of the cone is actually half the volume of the cylinder. Now it clearly is a wrong result and hence my approach as a whole or some step  within it is wrong. I'm not able to spot the error here and would appreciate help. It is as follows, Imagine a cylinder with a radius r and a height h. Imagine the cylinder to be translucent. Now construct a cone inside the cylinder. Draw an altitude right through the middle of the cone, through the core of the entire structure (cone inside the cylinder). Imagine the structure right in front of your eyes. Consider a 2D vertical cross section of the shape right through the middle. The cone can be divided into two triangles on either side of the altitude with areas equal to (rh)/2. There are two inverted triangles on either side of the cone which would become the parts of the left-over cylinder should the cone be removed. Areas of these triangles are also (rh)/2. This parity of the two inner triangles(inside the cone) and two outer triangles (outside the cone) would be true throughout the cylinder. In other words, an infinite number of such pairs exists about the central altitude line. All such pairs, when added up, make up the solid cylinder. This implies that the volume of the cone and the volume of the left-over shape when the cone is removed are the same, that is, the cone is half the volume of the cylinder. What am I missing?
