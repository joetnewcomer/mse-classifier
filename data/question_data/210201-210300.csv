I.e. using the union symbol ( ∪ ) 2) The next thing I want to know is how I can expand the statement using a more generic symbolic language where I am forced also to replace ∪ with its axiomatic definitions assuming that I understand logic and share the assumption that things can exist. I assume that this is possible as I understand the ZFC is built on axiomatic reasoning on top of some simple assumptions shared by most mammals (things can exist etc. etc.). The reason I'm asking is that I find Set Theory appealing to begin to learn the language you guys use (i.e. mathematics).

37,Lower bound on the size of a maximal matching in a simple cycle,Lower bound on the size of a maximal matching in a simple cycle,,"Let $C_n$ denote an undirected simple cycle of $n$ nodes. I want to determine a lower bound on the size of a maximal matching $M$ of $C_n$. Please note: A subset $M$ of the edges in $C_n$ is called a matching $\Leftrightarrow$ every node $v\in C_n$ is incident to at most one edge in $M$. The matching $M$ is called maximal $\Leftrightarrow$ it cannot be extended to a larger matching by adding an edge which is not already contained in $M$. Proof: Let $M$ denote a maximal matching in $C_n$. Since $(v_{2i-1},v_{2i})_{1\le i\le \lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor}$ is a matching in $C_n$, |M| must be greater or equal to $\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor$. The Assumption $|M|\ge\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor +1$ leads to $|\left\{v\in C_n\;|\;\exists w\in C_n : (v,w)\in M\vee (w,v)\in M \right\}|\ge \lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor+2$, contrary to $|C_n|=n$. Am I missing something or is everything as it should be? I'm a little bit confused, because the exercise only asked for a lower bound. EDIT: Okay, I was confused by the terms maximum matching and maximal matching . Let me try to provide a proof for a lower bound of a maximal matching: I think its easier to construct a maximal matching and show that it can't be reduced while maintaining its maximality. Let $C_n=(v_0,\dots,v_{n+1})$ with $v_{n+1}=v_0$. Please consider the sequence $S:=(v_{3i},v_{3i+1})_{0\le i\le \lfloor\frac{n}{3}\rfloor -1}$ if $n$ is uneven, extend $S$ by $(v_{n-1},v_n)$. $S$ induces a matching $M$ of $C_n$ with $|M|=\lceil\frac{n}{3}\rceil$.

So, $M'$ cannot be maximal.","Let $C_n$ denote an undirected simple cycle of $n$ nodes. I want to determine a lower bound on the size of a maximal matching $M$ of $C_n$. Please note: A subset $M$ of the edges in $C_n$ is called a matching $\Leftrightarrow$ every node $v\in C_n$ is incident to at most one edge in $M$. The matching $M$ is called maximal $\Leftrightarrow$ it cannot be extended to a larger matching by adding an edge which is not already contained in $M$. Proof: Let $M$ denote a maximal matching in $C_n$. Since $(v_{2i-1},v_{2i})_{1\le i\le \lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor}$ is a matching in $C_n$, |M| must be greater or equal to $\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor$. The Assumption $|M|\ge\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor +1$ leads to $|\left\{v\in C_n\;|\;\exists w\in C_n : (v,w)\in M\vee (w,v)\in M \right\}|\ge \lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor+2$, contrary to $|C_n|=n$. Am I missing something or is everything as it should be? I'm a little bit confused, because the exercise only asked for a lower bound. EDIT: Okay, I was confused by the terms maximum matching and maximal matching . Let me try to provide a proof for a lower bound of a maximal matching: I think its easier to construct a maximal matching and show that it can't be reduced while maintaining its maximality. Let $C_n=(v_0,\dots,v_{n+1})$ with $v_{n+1}=v_0$. Please consider the sequence $S:=(v_{3i},v_{3i+1})_{0\le i\le \lfloor\frac{n}{3}\rfloor -1}$ if $n$ is uneven, extend $S$ by $(v_{n-1},v_n)$. $S$ induces a matching $M$ of $C_n$ with $|M|=\lceil\frac{n}{3}\rceil$.
