2,Find all functions on the non-zero reals to itself satisfying $f(xy)=f(x+y)(f(x)+f(y))$,Find all functions on the non-zero reals to itself satisfying,f(xy)=f(x+y)(f(x)+f(y)),"Find all functions $f\colon\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\}\to\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\}$ such that $f(xy)=f(x+y)(f(x)+f(y))$. I'm reasonably confident that the solutions are $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$ and $f(x)=\frac{1}{2}$. Here's some progress: Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(x+y)(f(x)+f(y))=f(xy)$, and let $a=f(1)$. $P(1,1)\implies f(2)=\frac{1}{2}$. $P(2,1)\implies f(3)=\frac{1}{2a+1}$. $P(3,1)\implies f(4)=\frac{1}{2a^2+a+1}$. $P(4,1)\implies f(5)=\frac{1}{2a^3+a^2+a+1}$. $P(5,1)\implies f(6)=\frac{1}{2a^4+a^3+a^2+a+1}$. $P(2,3)\implies (2a-1)(a-1)(a+1)(2a^2+a+1)=0$ and so $\boxed{a\in\left\{-1,\frac{1}{2},+1\right\}}$. If $a=1$, then inductively $f(n)=\frac{1}{n}$ $\forall n\in\mathbb{N}$. Let $x>0$. Then if $n\in\mathbb{N}$, considering $P(x+n,1)$ inductively, we get $f(x+n)=\frac{f(x)}{nf(x)+1}<\frac{1}{n}$, and so $P(x,n)\implies f(nx)=\frac{f(x)}{n}$. Thus $f(x)\leq\frac{1}{n}$ if $x\geq n$, so for $x\geq1$, we have $f(x)\leq\frac{1}{\lfloor x\rfloor}$. Then for $x>1$, inductively we have $$f(x)^{2^n}=f\left(x^{2^n}\right)\leq\frac{1}{\left\lfloor x^{2^n}\right\rfloor},$$ so taking the $2^n$th root and $n\to\infty$, we get $f(x)\leq\frac{1}{x}$ for all $x\geq1$ (Could someone verify that this part is rigorous?) . But since $f(2^nx)=\frac{f(x)}{2^n}$, we get $f(x)\leq\frac{1}{x}$ for all $x\geq\frac{1}{2^n}$. Again, taking $n\to\infty$, $f(x)\leq\frac{1}{x}$ for all $x>0$. Now $P\left(x,\tfrac{1}{x}\right)\implies1=f(1)=f(x+1/x)(f(x)+f(1/x))\leq1$, so $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$ $\forall x>0$. However, I'm struggling first to extend this to $x<0$, and secondly to deal with the cases $a=\frac{1}{2}$, $a=-1$. EDIT: I've solved the problem. If $x<0$, then $f(x)^2=f\left(x^2\right)\implies f(x)=\pm\frac{1}{x}$. Choosing $n>|x|$, we have $$\frac{1}{x+n}=f(x+n)=\frac{f(x)}{nf(x)+1},$$and it is clear then that $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$ $\forall x\in\mathbb R\setminus\{0\}$, which is indeed a solution. If $f(1)=\frac{1}{2}$, then we claim that $\boxed{f(x)=\frac{1}{2}\;\forall x\in\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\}}$ is the unique solution. Inductively, $f(n)=\frac{1}{2}$ $\forall n\in\mathbb N$. $P(x,1)\implies f(x+1)=\frac{2f(x)}{2f(x)+1}$, and thus $f(x+2)=\frac{4f(x)}{6f(x)+1}$ and $f(x+4)=\frac{16f(x)}{30f(x)+1}$. $P(x,2)\implies f(2x)=\frac{2f(x)(2f(x)+1)}{6f(x)+1}$. $P(2x,2)\implies f(4x)=\frac{4f(x)(2f(x)+1)(8f(x)^2+10f(x)+1)}{(6f(x)+1)(24f(x)^2+18f(x)+1)}$. $P(x,4)\implies f(4x)=\frac{8f(x)(2f(x)+1)}{30f(x)+1}$. Equating the two expressions for $f(4x)$, we get $(2f(x)-1)^2(2f(x)+1)(12f(x)+1)=0$. Thus $f(x)=\frac{1}{2}$ $\forall x\in\mathbb R\setminus\{0\}$. If $f(1)=-1$, then we claim that there are no solutions. $P(x,1)\implies f(x+1)=\frac{f(x)}{f(x)-1}$, so $P(x+1,1)\implies f(x+2)=f(x)$. Thus $f(4)=f(2)=\frac{1}{2}$. But \begin{align*}P(x,2)&\implies f(2x)=f(x+2)\left(f(x)+\tfrac{1}{2}\right)=f(x)\left(f(x)+\tfrac{1}{2}\right)\\ P(x,4)&\implies f(4x)=f(x+4)\left(f(x)+\tfrac{1}{2}\right)=f(x)\left(f(x)+\tfrac{1}{2}\right)\end{align*}Thus $f(x)=f(2x)=f(x)\left(f(x)+\tfrac{1}{2}\right)\implies f(x)=\frac{1}{2}$ $\forall x\in\mathbb R\setminus\{0\}$, a contradiction.","Find all functions $f\colon\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\}\to\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\}$ such that $f(xy)=f(x+y)(f(x)+f(y))$.
