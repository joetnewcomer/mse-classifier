Thank you!","This question already has answers here : Modular exponentiation by hand ($a^b\bmod c$) (12 answers) Closed 4 years ago . I'm trying to calculate $2^{47}\pmod{\! 65}$, but I don't know how... I know that: $65=5\cdot 13$ and that: $2^{47}\equiv 3 \pmod{\! 5}$ and $2^{47}\equiv 7\pmod{\! 13}$... (I used Euler) But how should I continue from here? (I saw at WolframAlpha that the result is 33, but I don't have any idea how to get it...) I'd like to get any help... Thank you!",,"['group-theory', 'elementary-number-theory', 'modular-arithmetic', 'congruences']"
90,Subgroups of smallest possible index in a solvable group,Subgroups of smallest possible index in a solvable group,,"The following question appears in Isaacs' Finite Group Theory: 3B.15) (Berkovich) Let $G$ be solvable, and let $H<G$ be a proper subgroup having the smallest possible index in $G$. Show that $H\lhd G$. If we assume that $G$ is a minimal counterexample, then it is possible to show that $H$ has trivial core in $G$, that $H$ is a complement of the Fitting subgroup of $G$, and that the Fitting subgroup is a unique minimal normal subgroup of $G$. But this mostly follows from the fact that $H$ must be a maximal subgroup of $G$, rather than using the fact that $H$ has smallest possible index. It also doesn't seem to lead to any contradiction. I cannot find the solution. Problem 3B.12 from the same chapter is wrong, so there is the possibility that this question is wrong too.

(Recognising a group from a presentation).,,"I am trying to find out what the following group is: $$G = \langle a, b \mid ab^2 = b^2a,\ a^4 = b^3\rangle.$$ Due to the isomorphism problem for groups, there is no algorithmic way to approach questions like this in general. The only technique I know of is to consider the abelianisation of $G$, which, if I'm not mistaken, is the group given by the same generators and relations, together with the additional relation $ab = ba$. In this case, aside from the fact that you can remove the first relation, it doesn't seem be any simpler to determine. So my questions are as follows: What is the group $G$? Without using the answer to the first question (i.e. using only the presentation), what is the abelianisation of $G$? In addition, any descriptions of other techniques that one can use to get a better understanding of a group from a presentation would be very much appreciated.","I am trying to find out what the following group is: $$G = \langle a, b \mid ab^2 = b^2a,\ a^4 = b^3\rangle.$$ Due to the isomorphism problem for groups, there is no algorithmic way to approach questions like this in general.

97,Are all finite groups cyclic?,Are all finite groups cyclic?,,"I've been reading about Number Theory and I came across this proof that the finite subgroups of the multiplicative group of a field is cyclic. However, it seems the proof applies to all finite groups so please tell me where I go wrong. Let $G$ be a generic group of order $n$. By Lagrange the order of the elements of the group must divide $n$. Let $\psi(d)$ count the number of elements in the group of order $d$. Since $\sum_{d|n} \psi(d)=n$ the Möbius Inversion theorem tells us that this function is just Euler's totient function. Since this function is always one or greater, we always have that there exists an element of order exactly $n$, so the group is cyclic. Obviously I know the answer is no, but I thought using this title would make things more interesting.","I've been reading about Number Theory and I came across this proof that the finite subgroups of the multiplicative group of a field is cyclic.
