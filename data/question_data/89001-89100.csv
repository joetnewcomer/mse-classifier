1,Solution verification - Exercise 1.4 in Brezis's Functional Analysis,Solution verification - Exercise 1.4 in Brezis's Functional Analysis,,"Exercise 1.4 in Brezis's Functional Analysis, Sobolev Spaces and partial Differential Equations reads as follows: Let $E = c_0$ be the space of real sequences tending to $0$ with norm $||u|| = \sup_k |u_k|$ . In $E$ define for $u = (u_1, u_2, \ldots)$ $$ f(u) = \sum_1^\infty \frac{1}{2^n} u_n. $$ 1. Check that $f$ is a continuous linear functional on $E$ and compute $||f||_{E^*}$ .    2. Can one find some $u \in E$ such that $||u|| = 1$ and $f(u) = ||f||_{E^*}$ ? I was able to find a solution for this problem, but I lack confidence. Is the following correct? Linearity is trivial.  Now, note that $$ |f(u)| = \left|\sum_1^\infty \frac{1}{2^n} u_n\right| \leq \sum_1^\infty \frac{1}{2^n} |u_n|. $$ The norm on $c_0$ , according to Section 11.3, is $$ ||u|| = \sup_n |x_n|. $$ We know that $x_n \to 0$ , so by the definition of convergence we have that $|u_n| \to 0$ . Then $(|u_n|)_n$ is bounded by $\sup_n |u_n|$ . Hence $$ |f(u)| \leq \left(\sup_n |u_n|\right) \left(\sum_1^\infty \frac{1}{2^n}\right) =  ||u||. $$ We conclude that $f$ is bounded and hence continuous. Now, we have that $$ ||f|| = \sup_{||u|| \leq 1} |f(u)| \leq 1,  $$ by the above result. Fix $\varepsilon > 0$ . Then there is some $k \in \Bbb{N}$ such that $\sum_1^k 1/(2^n) > 1 - \varepsilon$ . But this is just $f(u_k)$ , where $$ u_k = (1, 1, \ldots, 1, 0, 0 \ldots), $$ where the $1$ s go until the $k$ -th position. That means that for arbitrarily small $\varepsilon > 0$ there are elements in $B_{c_0}(0)$ such that $|f(u)| > 1 - \varepsilon$ . Hence $$ 1 \leq \sup_{||x|| \leq 1} |f(u)| \leq 1 $$ and therefore $$ ||f|| = 1. $$ If there was such an $u$ , we would have $$ f(u) - 1 = 0 \implies \sum_1^\infty \frac{1}{2^n}(u_n - 1) = 0, $$ which in turn implies that $u_n = 1$ for every $n$ . But this is absurd, since $u_n \to 0$ .

6,Proof Verification - Convergence of a Sequence in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$,Proof Verification - Convergence of a Sequence in,L^2(\mathbb{R}),"Let $f$ be an element in the Sobolev space $H^1(\mathbb{R})=W^{1,2}(\mathbb{R})$ . For every $h>0$ , let $$f_h(x)=\frac{1}{h}(f(x+h)-f(x))$$ Prove that $$\lim_{h\to 0^+}\left\Vert f'-f_h\right\Vert_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}=0$$ My proof seems to be unnecessarily long and anyone who can kindly check if there are any mistakes will be appreciated! Let $\mathcal{D}$ denote the set of all smooth, compactly supported functions $\varphi:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ . It is well-known that $\mathcal{D}$ is dense in $H^1(\mathbb{R})$ . So there is a sequence $(\varphi_n)$ in $\mathcal{D}$ such that $$\lim_{n\to \infty}\left\Vert \varphi_n-f\right\Vert_{H^1(\mathbb{R})}=\lim_{n\to \infty}\left(\left\Vert \varphi_n-f\right\Vert_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}+\left\Vert \varphi_n'-f'\right\Vert_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}\right)=0$$ It follows that $$\lim_{n\to \infty}\left\Vert \varphi_n-f\right\Vert_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}=\lim_{n\to \infty}\left\Vert \varphi_n'-f'\right\Vert_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}=0$$ So both $\varphi_n$ and $(\varphi_n')$ are convergent, hence Cauchy, in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ . Hence, for any $\epsilon>0$ , there exists an $N_1\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $$i,j>N_1\Rightarrow\left\Vert \varphi_i'-\varphi_j'\right\Vert_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}<\epsilon$$ For every $h>0$ and every $n\in \mathbb{N}$ , define the function $$\varphi_{h,n}(x)=\frac{1}{h}(\varphi_n(x+h)-\varphi_n(x))$$ Now let $n$ be fixed. By the mean value theorem, for every $x$ , there exists some $y\in (x,x+h)$ such that $$\left|\varphi_n'(x)-\varphi_{h,n}(x)\right|^2=\left|\varphi_n'(x)-\varphi_n'(y)\right|^2\leq 2\left\Vert \varphi_n\right\Vert_{C^1(\mathbb{R})}^2=M_n$$ So the sequence $(\left|\varphi_n'-\varphi_{h,n}\right|^2)_h$ is dominated by the Lebesgue integrable function $g_n=M_n\cdot\chi_{\text{support}(\varphi_n)}$ (which is a scalar multiple of a characteristic function). By the dominated convergence theorem, $$ \begin{aligned} \lim_{h\to 0}\int_{\mathbb{R}}\left|\varphi_n'(x)-\varphi_{h,n}(x)\right|^2dx &=\int_{\mathbb{R}}\lim_{h\to 0}\left|\varphi_n'(x)-\varphi_{h,n}(x)\right|^2dx \\ &=\int_{\mathbb{R}}\left[\lim_{h\to 0}\left|\varphi_n'(x)-\varphi_{h,n}(x)\right|\right]^2dx \\ &=0 \end{aligned} $$ So for every $n\in \mathbb{N}$ we have $$\lim_{h\to 0}\left\Vert \varphi_n'-\varphi_{h,n}\right\Vert_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}=0$$ Furthermore, when $h$ is fixed, $(\varphi_{h,n})_n$ converges to $f_h$ in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ because $\varphi_n$ converges to $f$ in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ . In particular, $(\varphi_{h,n})_n$ is Cauchy in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ . Hence, for any $\epsilon>0$ , there exists an $N_2\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $$i,j>N_2\Rightarrow\left\Vert \varphi_{h,i}-\varphi_{h,j}\right\Vert_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}<\epsilon$$ Finally, we know that for arbitrary $m,n,p\in \mathbb{N}$ , $$ \left\Vert f'-f_h\right\Vert_{L^2(\mathbb{R})} \leq \left\Vert f'-\varphi_m'\right\Vert_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}+ \left\Vert \varphi_m'-\varphi_n'\right\Vert_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}+ \left\Vert \varphi_n'-\varphi_{h,n}\right\Vert_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}+ \left\Vert \varphi_{h,n}-\varphi_{h,p}\right\Vert_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}+ \left\Vert \varphi_{h,p}-f_h\right\Vert_{L^2(\mathbb{R})} $$ Fix an $\epsilon>0$ . (i) Choose an $m_0>N_1$ and an $n_0>\max\{N_1,N_2\}$ such that $$\left\Vert f'-\varphi_{m_0}'\right\Vert_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}<\frac{\epsilon}{5};\qquad \left\Vert \varphi_{m_0}'-\varphi_{n_0}'\right\Vert_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}<\frac{\epsilon}{5}$$ (ii) There exists an $h_0>0$ such that whenever $0<h<h_0$ , $$\left\Vert \varphi_{n_0}'-\varphi_{h,n_0}\right\Vert_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}<\frac{\epsilon}{5}$$ (iii) For any fixed $h\in (0,h_0)$ , choose a $p_0>N_2$ such that $$\left\Vert \varphi_{h,n_0}-\varphi_{h,p_0}\right\Vert_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}<\frac{\epsilon}{5};\qquad \left\Vert \varphi_{h,p_0}-f_h\right\Vert_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}<\frac{\epsilon}{5}$$ We conclude that for every $h\in (0,h_0)$ , $$\left\Vert f'-f_h\right\Vert_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}<\epsilon$$ giving the result.","Let be an element in the Sobolev space .

This is easy to show since if $V(q,m)$ is essentially a basis element $$ V(q,m) = \left\{x : q(x) < \frac{1}{m} \right\} = \left\{ x : p_1(x),\ldots, p_n(x) < \frac{1}{m}, p_i \in \mathcal{Q} \right\} = \\\bigcap_{i=1}^n \left\{x : p_i(x) < \frac{1}{m} \right\} $$ So each $V(q,m)$ is actually a basis element generated by the subbasis defined by the seminorms of $\mathcal{P}$ , hence they generate the same topology. b) I'm stuck at the moment for this one.

If a Banach Space $B$ does not have the finite tree property, then for every $\varepsilon>0$ there is an $n$ and a $\delta>0$ , such that if $z \in B$ and $(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_{2^n})$ is an $(n,\varepsilon)$ -partition of $z$ then $$\sum_{ j=1}^{2^n} \|x_j\| \ge (1+\delta)\|z\|.$$ Definitions: An ordered pair $(x_1,x_2)$ in a Banach space is a $(1,\varepsilon)$ -part of a tree if $\|x_1 - x_2\| > \varepsilon$ . Now if the $(n,\varepsilon)$ -part of a tree is defined, we say that a $(2^{n+1})$ -tuple $(x_1, x_2,\dots,x_{2^{n+1}})$ is a $(n + 1, \varepsilon)$ -part of a tree if $\|x_{2j-1} -x_{2j} \| > \varepsilon$ , for $j=1,\dots,2^n$ and the $2^n$ -tuple $((x_1 + x_2)/2, (x_3 + x_4)/2, \dots)$ is an $(n,\varepsilon)$ -part of a tree. The Banach space $B$ has the finite tree property (FTP), if there is an $\varepsilon > 0$ such that for every n, there is an $(n,\varepsilon)$ -part of a tree where all elements have norm at most $1$ . The ordered pair $(x_1,x_2)$ is a $(1,\varepsilon)$ -partition of $z$ if $$x_1 + x_2 = z, \|x_1\|=\|x_2\|, \ and \ \|x_1/\|x_1\| - x_2/\|x_2\| \| \geq  \varepsilon.$$ Having defined an $(n, \varepsilon)$ -partition of $z$ , we say that the $2^{n+1}$ tuple $(y_1, y_2,..., y_{2^{n+1}})$ is an $(n+1,\varepsilon)$ -partition of $z$ if $\|y_{2j-1}\|=\|y_{2j}\|$ , $\|y_{2j-1}/\|y_{2j-1}\| - y_{2j}/\|y_{2j}\| \| \geq \varepsilon$ for $1\leq j \leq2^n$ and the $2^n$ -tuple $(y_1+y_2,y_3+ y_4,\dots)$ is an $(n,\varepsilon)$ - partition of $z$ . The proof is rather short, it says assume $z$ has norm equal to 1.Taking a $(n,\varepsilon)$ -partition of $z$ and multiplying by $2^n$ every element, we get a $(n,\varepsilon)$ -part of a tree whose vectors have all norm $\geq 1$ .(It is easy to prove by induction that all elements in a $(n, \varepsilon)$ -partition of $z$ have norm at least $ 1/2^{n}$ ). Now since $B$ does not have the FTP there is an $n$ and a $\delta>0$ such that for all $(n,\varepsilon)$ -parts of trees formed by multiplication by $2^n$ of the vectors in a $(n,\varepsilon)$ -partition, there is one vector of length $\geq 1+2^n \cdot \delta$ and then the result follows.

In what follows, let's assume that $\mathcal{A}$ is unital and has tracial states. I am wondering if there is any connection between tracial states, strictly positive elements, and (sums) of commutators. E.g., perhaps something like the following holds: Let $x^\ast = x$ . If $\tau (x) > 0$ for every tracial state $\tau$ on $\mathcal{A}$ , then $x = p + c$ for some strictly positive element $p$ and some $c$ which is a (sum) of commutator(s).

Let a quantum system with coordinates $q_a$ and momenta $p_b$ be given satisfying commutation relations $$[q_a,p_b]=i\delta_{ab}.$$ Further suppose the system has a Hamiltonian $H$ which is time-independent. Usually in that setting the path integral is introduced as a means to compute the transition amplitude $$\langle q',t'|q,t\rangle=\langle q'|e^{-iH(t'-t)}|q\rangle=\int\mathfrak{D}x(t)\exp\left\{iS[x(t)]\right\}$$ This is usually defined by a discretization procedure allied to a Wick rotation to Euclidean time $\tau = it$ to deal with convergence. The right discretization seems to be derived by slicing the time interval, evaluating $\langle q',t'|q,t\rangle$ to first order in $t'-t$ , and imposing some ordering convention. So: a path integral in Physics is defined by the continuum limit of these aforementioned discretizations. Cylinder set measures Now there's the mathematicians point of view on which one studies integration over locally convex vector spaces which are infinite dimensional. In that case, if $E$ is such a space we perform two definitions: Definition : Let $E$ be a locally convex vector space. A cylinder set is defined to be a subset $C\subset E$ of the form $$C=\{x\in E : (\ell_1(x),\dots,\ell_n(x))\in C_0\}$$ where $C_0\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is a Borel subset and $\ell_k\in E^\ast$ are continuous linear functionals. Equivalently, it is a preimage $C = P^{-1}(C_0)$ of a Borel set under a continuous linear map $P : E\to \mathbb{R}^n$ . Definition: Let $E$ be a locally convex vector space. A cylinder set measure $\nu$ is a nonnegative additive set function defined on the $\sigma$ -algebra generated by cylinder sets of $E$ such that for any continuous linear $P : E\to \mathbb{R}^n$ the set function $$\nu\circ P^{-1} : B\mapsto \nu(P^{-1}(B))$$ is countably additive. Comparison If we now compare there are a few points to mention: It seems that cylinder sets capture discretizations. If $x$ is a continuous path, $(\ell_1(x),\dots, \ell_n(x))$ is an $n$ -point discretization. To be even more precise in the case of paths we could take $\ell_k(x) = x(t_k)$ for some $t_1,\dots, t_n$ in the interval. In the same way we could take $\ell_k(x) = a_k$ some Fourier coefficient of $x(t)$ . I've seem both things done in Physics. It seems cylinder set measures are in fact a way to define ""a measure per discretization"". So for each discretization we give a measure - integrate over $n$ points, integrate over $n$ Fourier coefficients, so forth. Still, the connection doesn't feel complete for me. The issue is that to define a cylinder set measure we must define $\nu$ on the whole algebra generated by cylinder sets . The Physicist approach seems to do this exactly for a specific collection of cylinder sets. Either for the ones with $\ell_k(x) = x(t_k)$ or for the ones with $\ell(x_k)=a_k$ a Fourier coefficient. But there are infinitely many other choices of the $\ell_k$ which give rise to many more cylinder sets. And one would need still to define $\nu$ on the $\sigma$ -algebra itself.

Anyway if it is true, if I consider the functional the one driven by the convexified function we should have hence this shall prove that is the minimum of the functional of the problem. Finally the uniqueness of the minimum is given by the convexity of the functional hence it is a unique minimum also for . Can somebody please help me filling in the gaps what I am missing?

72,gradient flows on Hilbert manifolds,gradient flows on Hilbert manifolds,,"I would like to know if gradient flows of Morse-Bott functions on a Riemannian manifold always converge towards a unique critical point, provided that the flow line is bounded. To be more precise, a Morse-Bott function on a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ is a smooth map $f:M \longrightarrow \mathbb R$ such that the set of critical points $Crit f \subset M$ is a submanifold and $T_x Crit f = ker Hess f_x$ for all $x \in Crit f$ . It might be more convenient to express this by using the linear map $A_x:T_xM \longrightarrow T_xM$ given by $g_x(A_xv,w) =  Hess f_x(v,w)$ for $v,w \in T_xM$ . I am interested in the behaviour of maps $x:\mathbb R_+ \longrightarrow M$ satisfying $\dot x(t) = -\nabla f(x(t))$ . Does $lim_{t \to \infty} x(t)$ exist? An easy computation shows that $df_{x(s)} \longrightarrow 0$ for $s \to \infty$ . So if $x$ is bounded (e.g. if $M$ is compact) $x$ has to ""converge"" towards $Crit f$ . UNfortunately, this does not rule out that $x$ has several limits in $Crit f$ . (This can not happen for Morse functions, since in this case the critical points are isolated). The simplest case is the case where $M$ is finite dimensional. As far as I can see, the answer is already given by Austin and Braam in their paper ""Morse-Bott theory and equivariant cohomology"", 1995. In particular Theorem A.9 is important, stating that the stable manifold of a connected component $C \subset Crit f$ , given by $W^s(C) = \{x \in M | \phi_t(x) \to C\}$ where $\phi$ is the flow of the negative gradient, is indeed a submanifold. The second case is the case where $M$ is a Hilbert manifold (infinite dimensional) endowed with a complete metric on the tangent bundle. Although I could only find a paper dealing with this question in the Morse case (see Abbondandolo, Majer: ""A Morse complex for infinite dimensional manifolds"", Appendix C), I assume that it should be not to hard to extend the result to the Morse-Bott case. The important point here is that the operator $A_x$ mentioned above is symmetric and defined on the whole tangent space, so it has to be bounded. The last case is the one I am particularly interested in. We start again with a Hilbert manifold $M$ , but now endowed with an incomplete Riemannian metric (in my case, I have a Sobolev space $W^{1,2}$ which is only endowed with the $L^2$ metric). Let $H$ denote the complete Hilbert space where $T_xM \subset H$ is dense. Then the operator $A$ is unfortunately of the form $A_x:T_xM \subset H \longrightarrow H$ . Now $A_x$ is unbounded, but at least still symmetric and even essentially self-adjoint. However, here I am failing to apply the results from case 2, which strongly used the boundedness of $A$ . I would be very content if a similar result could be shown at least for the case, where $Crit f$ is finite dimensional. A remark: In the infinite dimensional case, one might have problems with the flow, since it might not be defined for all times. However, I start with a flow line which is already defined for all $t$ . Furthermore, I have found (with completely different techniques) a sequence $t_k \to \infty$ such that $x(t_k) \to p \in Crit f$ , which is enough to ensure that $x(t) \to Crit f$ . I would also be thankful for counterexamples where the gradient flow does not have a unique limit.

What this boils down to is that I am trying to ascertain the role of boundary conditions in the derivation of the Euler-Lagrange equations as presented in for instance Evans and whether it is possible to charactarize optimization problem by a certain partial differential operator (and in this application assuming boundary conditions makes no sense). As a remark, my confusion about whether the Euler-Lagrange equations depend on boundary conditions or not probably comes from me only studying evans, where the boundary conditions are naturally part of the problem, as the end goal is to study PDE. Here on the other hand, the objectives are switched and the end goal is to study optimization using PDE.","

What I have tried so far This means that for all compact sets $K \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, and all orders of differentiations $\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$, it must hold that \begin{equation}  \partial^{\alpha}(u_j*\phi_j) \to \partial^{\alpha}(u*\phi)  \tag{1} \end{equation} uniformly on $K$. I can use that $\partial^{\alpha}(u_j*\phi_j) = u_j*(\partial^{\alpha} \phi_j)$, and since $\partial^{\alpha} \phi_j \in C^{\infty}_0(\mathbb{R}^n)$, we only have to show (1) for $\alpha = 0$, because the other values follow by induction. Let $K \subset \mathbb{R}$. Then we know that  \begin{equation} |(u_j * \phi_j)(x) - (u*\phi)(x)| \leq |(u_j*\phi_j)(x) - (u_j*\phi)(x)| + |(u_j*\phi)(x) - (u*\phi)(x)| \end{equation} I will now show that both terms go to zero. We use the translation operator $T_x$ ($T_x \phi(y) = \phi(y-x)$) and the reflection operator $S$ ($S\phi(y) = \phi(-y)$). Now the first term is given by \begin{equation} (u_j*\phi_j)(x) - (u_j*\phi)(x) = u_j(T_x \circ S(\phi_j-\phi)) \end{equation} Because of the convergence of $\phi_j$ we know that there exists a compact set $A$ such that $\text{supp }\phi_j \subset A$ and $||\phi_j-\phi ||_{C^k} \to 0$ for all $k$. Hence we find that  \begin{equation} \text{supp }(T_x \circ S(\phi_j-\phi)) = x - \text{supp }(\phi_j-\phi) \subset K+(-A) := B \end{equation} Since $B$ is the sum of two compact sets, it itself is compact. We can now use the uniform boundedness theorem to find that  \begin{equation} |u_j (T_x \circ S(\phi_j -\phi))| \leq c || T_x \circ S(\phi_j -\phi)||_{C^k} = c ||\phi_j -\phi||_{C^k} \to 0 \end{equation} We now look at the second term. Let $v_j = u_j-u \to 0$ in $\mathcal{D}'(\mathbb{R}^n)$. Now by the same arguments as above we find by the uniform boundedness theorem \begin{equation} |v_j(T_x \circ S\phi)| \leq c || \phi||_{C^k} \leq M \end{equation} Now for $x,y \in K$ we find that  \begin{equation} |v_j*\phi(x) - v_j*\phi(y)| \leq |x-y| \sup_{z \in K} \partial (v_j*\phi)(z) \leq |x-y|M \end{equation} So that for all $\epsilon > 0$ we can pick $\delta = \frac{\epsilon}{M}$ and $|x-y| < \delta$ implies $|v_j*\phi(x) - v_j*\phi(y)|<\epsilon$. We now invoke the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem to find a uniformly convergent subsequence $v_{j_k}*\phi \to 0$. Since $v_j \to 0$ it must be that $v_j*\phi \to 0$ uniformly on $K$.

A particular case I am interested take $d: L^2_k([0,1]) \rightarrow L^2_{k-1}([0,1])$ (where $L^2_k$ denotes the Sobolev space with $k$ weak derivatives in $L^2$) and take $(,)$ as the $L^2([0,1])$ inner product.","Let $X$ and $Y$ be Hilbert spaces with respective inner products $\langle , \rangle_{X,Y}$. Let $A:X \rightarrow Y$ be a bounded linear operator. Assume there is a non-degenerate sesquilinear product $(,)$ on $Y$. Take $y \in Y$, and define the map $l_y : x' \in X \mapsto (A x', y)$. Assume this last map is bounded, then by Riesz's theorem, there exists a unique $x \in X$ such that $l_y(x') = \langle x' ,x \rangle_X$.
