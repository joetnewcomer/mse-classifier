I came upon the above double integral when simplifying an expression for a probability density function. How can I demonstrate that the integral is zero for any positive constants, $a$, $b$ and $c$? I've verified the result numerically. At the moment it seems rather fascinating to me that the integral should always be zero given the presence of three free variables, and I would expect there to be a relatively simple derivation. I've tried all sorts of approaches (integral substitutions including polar coordinates, differentiating under the integral, splitting the domain of integration into pieces) without seeming to make progress. To answer Ali's comment, below I give my crude Matlab code for evaluating the double integral (with the trapezoidal rule) and one output.

The problem is to change the order of integration of $$\int_0^1 \int_0^{3x} f(x,y)\ dy\ dx.$$ The answer is $$\int_0^3 \int_{\frac y3}^1 f(x,y)\ dx\ dy.$$ The book's solution reads: The region of integration is $0 \le x \le 1,\ 0 \le y \le 3x$.

36,Examining $\int_0^1 \left(\frac{x - 1}{\ln(x)} \right)^n\:dx$,Examining,\int_0^1 \left(\frac{x - 1}{\ln(x)} \right)^n\:dx,"I'm currently working on the following family of integrals: \begin{equation}  I_n = \int_0^1 \left(\frac{x - 1}{\ln(x)} \right)^n\:dx \end{equation} Where $n \in \mathbb{N}$ . I employed Feynman's Trick coupled with the Dominated Convergence Theorem and Leibniz's Integral Rule. In doing so, I introduced the following function: \begin{equation}  J_n(t) = \int_0^1 \left(\frac{x^t - 1}{\ln(x)} \right)^n\:dx \end{equation} Where $0 \leq t \leq 1 \subset \mathbb{R}$ .  With some fairly easy steps, I end up with the following ODE: \begin{equation}     J_n^n(t) =  (-1)^n \sum_{j = 1}^n {n \choose j} (-1)^j \frac{j^n}{jt + 1}   \nonumber \end{equation} Where $J_n^k(t)$ is the $k$ -th derivative of $J_n(t)$ with the conditions $J_n^k(0) = 0$ for $ 0 \leq k \leq n$ . As such, to resolve $J_n(t)$ I need to integrate $J_n^n(t)$ $n$ times whilst applying the initial conditions. Although I can do it for any fixed $n$ , I'm yet to be able to generalise it for any $n$ . I was wondering if anyone has working with this type of ODE and if so, is there any preferable ways to approach it? Initially I thought that using Laplace Transforms would be ideal as in applying it to $J_n^n(t)$ all terms would be removed given the initial condition. This felt apart as the Laplace Transform of $\frac{1}{t + a}$ is a nasty Special Function to work with. So, to repeat, is there an approach people can recommend? For anyone who may be interested, here is my work on this integral: In this section, I would like to address the following family of integrals: \begin{equation}     I_n = \int_0^1 \left( \frac{x - 1}{\ln(x)} \right)^n \:dx \nonumber  \end{equation} 0 To begin with, consider the case when $n = 1$ : \begin{equation}     I_1 = \int_0^1 \frac{x - 1}{\ln(x)}\:dx \nonumber  \end{equation} Here we introduce the function: \begin{equation}     J_1(t) = \int_0^1 \frac{x^t - 1}{\ln(x)}\:dx \nonumber  \end{equation} We observe that $I_1 = J_1(1)$ and $J_1(0) = 0$ . Here we employ Leibniz's  Integral Rule and differentiate under the curve with respect to $t$ : \begin{equation}     J_1'(t) = \int_0^1 \frac{\frac{d}{dt}\left[x^t - 1 \right]}{\ln(x)}\:dx = \int_0^1 \frac{\ln(x)x^t}{\ln(x)}\:dx = \int_0^1 x^t \:dx = \left[ \frac{x^{t  +1}}{t + 1}\right]_0^1 = \frac{1}{t + 1} \nonumber  \end{equation} We now integrate with respect to $t$ : \begin{equation}     J_1(t) = \int \frac{1}{t + 1} \:dt = \ln\left|t + 1 \right| + C \nonumber  \end{equation} Where $C$ is the constant of integration. To resolve $C$ we employ $J_1(0) = 0$ : \begin{equation}     J_1(0) = 0 = \ln\left|0 + 1\right| + C \rightarrow C = 0 \nonumber \end{equation} Thus, \begin{equation}     J_1(t) = \ln\left|t + 1\right| \nonumber \end{equation} We now resolve $I_1$ using $I_1 = J_1(1)$ : \begin{equation}     I_1 = J_1(1) = \ln\left|1 + 1\right| = \ln\left|2\right| \nonumber  \end{equation} The question I have is: Can this approach be used for other or all values of $n$ ?. To address this, I will proceed by applying the same method to $n = 2$ : \begin{equation}     I_2 = \int_0^1  \frac{\left(x - 1 \right)^2}{\ln^2(x)}\:dx \nonumber \end{equation} We introduce the function: \begin{equation}     J_2(t) = \int_0^1 \frac{\left( x^t - 1\right)^2}{\ln^2(x)}\:dx \nonumber \end{equation} We observe that $I_2 = J_2(1)$ and $J_2(0) = 0$ . We proceed here by employ Leibniz's Integral Rule and differentiate under the curve with respect to $t$ : \begin{equation}     J_2'(t) = \int_0^1 \frac{\frac{d}{dt}\left[\left(x^t - 1\right)^2 \right]}{\ln^2(x)}\:dx = \int_0^1 \frac{2\left(x^t - 1\right)\ln(x)x^t}{\ln^2(x)}\:dx = 2 \int_0^1 \frac{x^t\left(x^t - 1\right)}{\ln(x)}\:dx \nonumber  \end{equation} We observe that $J_2'(0) = 0$ . We now differentiate again with respect to $t$ : \begin{equation}     J_2''(t) = 2\int_0^1 \frac{\ln(x)x^t\cdot \left(x^t - 1\right) + x^t \cdot \ln(x)x^t}{\ln(x)}\:dx = 2\int_0^1 2x^{2t} - x^t \:dx = 2\left[\frac{2x^{2t + 1}}{2t + 1 } - \frac{x^{t + 1}}{t + 1} \right]_0^1 = 2\left[\frac{2}{2t + 1} - \frac{1}{t + 1}\right] \nonumber  \end{equation} We now integrate with respect to $t$ : \begin{equation}     J_2'(t) = 2\int \frac{2}{2t + 1} - \frac{1}{t + 1} \:dt =2\bigg[ \ln\left|2t + 1\right| - \ln\left|t + 1\right| \bigg]  + C \nonumber  \end{equation} Where $C$ is the constant of integration. To resolve $C$ , we use $J_2'(0) = 0$ : \begin{equation}     J_2'(0) = 0 = 2\bigg[\ln\left|2\cdot 0 + 1\right| - \ln\left|0 + 1\right|\bigg] + C = 0 + C \rightarrow C = 0 \nonumber \end{equation} Thus, \begin{equation}     J_2'(t) = 2\bigg[\ln\left|2t + 1\right| - \ln\left|t + 1\right|\bigg] \nonumber \nonumber  \end{equation} We now integrate again with respect to $t$ : \begin{equation}     J_2(t) = 2\int  \ln\left|2t + 1\right| - \ln\left|t + 1\right| \:dt = 2\bigg[\left(\frac{2t + 1}{2}\right)\bigg[ \ln\left|2t + 1\right| - 1 \bigg] - \bigg[ \left(t + 1\right)\ln\left|t + 1\right| - t \bigg] \bigg] + D \nonumber  \end{equation} Where $D$ is the constant of integration. To resolve $D$ we use the condition $J_2(0) = 0$ : \begin{equation}      J_2(0) = 0 = 2\bigg[\left(\frac{2\cdot 0 + 1}{2}\right)\bigg[ \ln\left|2\cdot 0 + 1\right| - 1 \bigg] - \bigg[ \left(0 + 1\right)\ln\left|0 + 1\right| - 0 \bigg]\bigg] + D   = -1+ D \rightarrow D = 1 \nonumber   \end{equation} Thus, \begin{equation}      J_2(t) = 2\bigg[\left(\frac{2t + 1}{2}\right)\bigg[ \ln\left|2t + 1\right| - 1 \bigg] - \bigg[ \left(t + 1\right)\ln\left|t + 1\right| - t \bigg]\bigg] + 1 \nonumber = \left(2t + 1\right)\ln\left|2t + 1\right| -2\left(t  + 1\right)\ln\left|t + 1\right| \nonumber   \end{equation} Thus, we now may resolve $I_2$ using $I_2 = J_2(1)$ : \begin{equation}      I_2 = J_2(1) = \left( 2\cdot 1 + 1\right)\ln\left|2\cdot 1 + 1\right| -2 \left(1 + 1\right)\ln\left|1 + 1\right| = 3\ln(3) -4\ln(2) \nonumber  \end{equation} Here I will attempt to resolve the integral in it's general form. I will employ the same approach as for $n = 1, 2$ and introduce the function: \begin{equation}     J_n(t) = \int_0^1 \frac{\left(x^t - 1 \right)^n}{\ln^n(x)}\:dx \nonumber  \end{equation} We observe that $I_n = J_n(1)$ and $J_n(0) = 0$ . We begin by expanding the integrand's numerator using the Binomail Expansion: \begin{equation}     J_n(t) = \int_0^1 \frac{\sum_{j = 0}^n { n \choose j} \left(x^t\right)^j \left(-1 \right)^{n - j}}{\ln^n(x)}\:dx = (-1)^n \sum_{j = 0}^n {n \choose j} (-1)^j \int_0^1 \frac{x^{jt}}{\ln^n(x)}\:dx \nonumber \end{equation} Taking the same approach as before, we now employ Leibniz's Integral Rule and differentiate $n$ times under the curve with respect to $t$ : \begin{equation}     J_n^n(t) = (-1)^n \sum_{j = 0}^n {n \choose j} (-1)^j \int_0^1 \frac{\frac{d^n}{dt^n}\left[x^{jt}\right]}{\ln^n(x)}\:dx \nonumber \end{equation} Here we note: \begin{equation}     \frac{d^n}{dt^n}\left[x^{jt}\right] = j^n \ln^n(x)x^{jt} \nonumber  \end{equation} ,  Noting that for $j= 0$ ,  the derivative is $0$ . Thus, \begin{equation}     J_n^n(t) = (-1)^n \sum_{j = 1}^n {n \choose j} (-1)^j \int_0^1 \frac{j^n \ln^n(x)x^{jt}}{\ln^n(x)}\:dx = (-1)^n \sum_{j = 1}^n {n \choose j} (-1)^j j^n \int_0^1 x^{jt}\:dx  =  (-1)^n \sum_{j = 1}^n {n \choose j} (-1)^j \frac{j^n}{jt + 1}   \nonumber \end{equation} Where $J_n^k(0) = 0$ for $k = 0,\dots, n$ .","I'm currently working on the following family of integrals: Where .

I do not see why this implies that the integral of the limit path is $0$ (when the contour reduces to two circles, after the overlapping corridor segments cancel). My best guess is that he is using a theorem of the form ""the limit of the integrals of a series of uniformly convergent functions is the integral of the limit function"" (see Rudin's PMA , page 151), but obviously the circumstances are a bit different here because we are working with paths and he has not shown uniform convergence of the paths to the limit path.

Consider now a large number of lines and define $s(x,t)$ as the fraction of lines where position $x$ has not yet been duplicated ( $I(x,t)$ is the same across all lines).

First, note that a position $x$ is not duplicated at time $t$ iff its duplication timing $t_D(x)$ is greater than $t$ .

This equation has the following elegant inverse, using the D'Alembert operator $\square=\frac{1}{v^2}\partial_t^2-\partial_x^2$ , $$ I(x,t)=-\frac{v}{2}\square \log s(x,t) $$ On the other hand, given the probabilistic description provided before, we also have $$ \langle t_D(x)\rangle=\int_0^\infty tP(x,t)\,dt=-\int_0^\infty t\partial_ts(x,t)\,dt $$ However, from here, it is not clear how to rewrite this so that I have the rate $f(x)$ as a function of $\langle t_D(x)\rangle$ .

Example: $f(x) = e^{-x^2}$. Let $A$ be the set of elementary functions $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. Then: Add finite many Riemann integrable functions $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ to $A$. Add all compositions of $A$-functions to $A$. Repeat 2. until the the set does not grow anymore. (Is this process guaranteed to end after finite steps? If not, 1. should only allow functions which leads to an end.)

91,Evaluate $\int_{-\pi/4}^{\pi/4}\frac{x}{\sin x}\mathrm{d}x$,Evaluate,\int_{-\pi/4}^{\pi/4}\frac{x}{\sin x}\mathrm{d}x,"I am working on the integral $$I=\int_{-\pi/4}^{\pi/4}\frac{x}{\sin x}\mathrm{d}x=2\int_0^{\pi/4}\frac{x}{\sin x}\mathrm{d}x$$ Which I am fairly confident has a closed form, as $$\int_{0}^{\pi/2}\frac{x}{\sin x}\mathrm{d}x=2G$$ Where $G$ is Catalan's constant. Preforming a tangent half angle substitution, we have that $$I=4\int_0^{\sqrt{2}-1}\frac{\arctan x}{x}\mathrm{d}x$$ Then using $$\arctan x=\sum_{n\geq0}(-1)^n\frac{x^{2n+1}}{2n+1}$$ We have $$I=4\sum_{n\geq0}\frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)^2}(\sqrt{2}-1)^{2n+1}$$ Which is painfully similar to $G$ . I do not know how to deal with that extra $(\sqrt{2}-1)^{2n+1}$ bit though... In another post of mine I showed that $$I=\pi\sum_{n\geq1} n\log\bigg(\frac{4n+1}{4n-1}\bigg)\prod_{k\geq1\\k\neq n}\frac{k^2}{k^2-n^2}$$ And similarly I showed that $$\sum_{n\geq1}n\log\bigg(\frac{2n+1}{2n-1}\bigg)\prod_{k\geq1\\k\neq n}\frac{k^2}{k^2-n^2}=\frac{4G}\pi$$ So I have to questions.
