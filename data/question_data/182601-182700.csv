0,Is $\tan\theta\cos\theta=\sin\theta$ an identity?,Is  an identity?,\tan\theta\cos\theta=\sin\theta,"A friend of mine, who is a high school teacher, called me today and asked the question above in the title.

15,Understanding the difference between pre-image and inverse,Understanding the difference between pre-image and inverse,,"I am a little confused as to what the difference between the pre-image and the inverse of a function are and how to find each given a particular function ( I had though they were essentially the same thing but I realise now I was mistaken in that thought ). From Wikipedia the definitions given are : Inverse Let $f$ be a function whose domain is the set $X$ , and whose image (range) is the set $Y$ . Then $f$ is invertible if there exists a function $g$ with domain $Y$ and image $X$ , with the property: $f ( x ) = y \iff g ( y ) = x . $ If $f$ is invertible, the function $g$ is unique, which means that there is exactly one function $g$ satisfying this property (no more, no less). That function $g$ is then called the inverse of $f$ , and is usually denoted as $f ^{−1}$ Pre-image Let $f$ be a function from $X$ to $Y$ . The preimage or inverse image of a set $B\subseteq Y$ under $f$ is the subset of $X$ defined by $f ^{− 1 }[ B ] = \{ x \in X \mid f ( x ) \in B \}$ . So using an example I want to see if I have this about right ( please correct any mistakes I make) Example 1: Lets say $f:\Bbb R \rightarrow \Bbb R$ $f(x)=x^2$ For this example, clearly $f$ cannot be invertible (hence no inverse) as there exists no function $g$ which will satisfy $ f ( x ) = y \iff g ( y ) = x$ . (as it would only map to positive values of $\Bbb R$ (i.e. not the whole set)) The pre-image of this function I believe is related to the inverse except it does not require that we map to the whole set $\Bbb R$ , but rather just a subset of it. Therefore we can find the function $f^{-1}$ in an analogous way to to finding the inverse we just have to be more considerate about what the co-domain of this function is. So if $f(x)=x^2 \Rightarrow y=x^2  $ swap variables to get $x=y^2 \Rightarrow \sqrt{x}=y=f^{-1} $ So the pre-image is the set $f ^{− 1 }[ \Bbb R_+ ] = \{ x \in X \mid f ( x ) \in \Bbb R_+, f^{-1}=\sqrt{x} \} $ Example 2: An example of an invertible function would be $f:\Bbb R \rightarrow \Bbb R$ $f(x)=5x$ , as a function $g(x)=x/5$ has domain $\Bbb R$ and range $\Bbb R$ and satisfies $f ( x ) = y ⇔ g ( y ) = x .$ The pre-image in this case will be equal to the inverse.

I found a proof of the second right implication (proving that $f$ is surjective) that I can't understand. The proof is as follows: ""Let $y\in D$, consider the set $D=\{y\}$. Then $f(f^{-1}(\{y\}))=\{y\}$ wich implies $y\in f(f^{-1}(\{y\}))$, this is, $y=f(x)$ for an element $x\in f^{-1}(\{y\})\subseteq A$. This proves that $f$ is surjective."" Would appreciate an explanation of this last proof, helpful hints or proofs of these implications. Thank you beforehand. For the left implications I proved the equalitiess by proving that $P\subseteq Q$ and $Q\subseteq P$ (then $P=Q$). There are 2 inclusions that do not need $f$ to be injective or surjective where I have no difficulties proving: $C \subseteq f^{-1}(f(C))$ $f(f^{-1}(D) \subseteq D$ This means the other 2 inclusions must use the premise of $f$ being injective or surjective. I have proved successfully that $f(f^{-1}(D) \supseteq D$ using the that $f$ is surjective. But when proving $C \supseteq f^{-1}(f(C))$ I didn't use the $f$ is injective so something must be wrong.

You can wrap the integers around the origin of the 2D Cartesian grid like a spiral, or you can use some space filling curve, or you can map the integers individually to naturals by ""folding up"" the real line and then use a common bijection between naturals, like the Cantor pairing function (which is what the answer to this question does). But so far, I haven't been able to come up with a bijection that has a simple closed form. I know you can express that ""folding up"" operation using $\mathrm{sgn}$ and $\lfloor\cdot\rfloor$, but those seem inelegant, and I'm looking for something that feels more ""natural"" (no pun intended) to the domain of $\mathbb{Z}$ than mapping them to naturals first, applying a bijection there, and mapping the result back to an integer. For the positive naturals, there's this very elegant map: $$ f(a,b) = 2^{a-1}(2b-1) $$ Extending $b$ to the integers is not a problem, but then a) we can't cover $0$ with this, b) we've already covered all other integers, so there's no room left if we want to extend $a$ to the integers as well (which would require changes anyway, since we can't just work with negative powers of $2$ here).

So my question is, are there any bijections between $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}^2$ which can be expressed in a simple closed form, akin to $f$ above, without reducing the problem to the naturals?

When it comes to this area, I'm honestly a complete newb. Are there any good introductions or resources that can help get me on a clear path to understanding? I have some concept on simple functions, but not much. Tendency in study has been that I'll find myself too deep in something too complicated too quickly and forget everything. For instance, to borrow from another open bounty at this time, I cannot read the following: $$\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty J_n(x) J_{n+m}(x) = \delta(m)$$ My mind is stuck in code, help me out of my cave! :)",,"['soft-question', 'functions', 'notation', 'online-resources']"
93,$f \circ g =\operatorname{ id}$ and $g \circ f \neq \operatorname{id}$?,and ?,f \circ g =\operatorname{ id} g \circ f \neq \operatorname{id},"Are there two functions $f$ and $g$ s.t. $$f \circ g = \operatorname{id}$$ but $$g \circ f \neq \operatorname{id}?$$ Could someone give an example or a proof that this is impossible? This must be trivial, but I can't figure it out. :) Thanks!","Are there two functions $f$ and $g$ s.t. $$f \circ g = \operatorname{id}$$ but $$g \circ f \neq \operatorname{id}?$$ Could someone give an example or a proof that this is impossible?

Take the function $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ given by $f(x) = x^2$. The formal definition of injectivity is $f(a)=f(b) \implies a = b$. Therefore the function $f(x)$ is not injective because $-1 \neq 1$ while $f(-1)=f(1)=1$. But when I try to specify the negation of the statement ""f is injective"", I run into problems. I know that the negation of ""P implies Q"" is ""P but not Q"" so the formal definition of non-injectivity should be $f(a)=f(b) \implies a\neq b$, right? The problem is this statement doesn't hold for the function $f(x)=x^2$, because $f(1) = f(1)$ while it's not true that $1 \neq 1$.
