Let $M$ be an n-dimensional smooth manifold. Let $(U,\varphi)$ be a chart of $M$ , i.e. $U\subset M$ open and $\varphi:U\rightarrow\varphi(U)\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ is an homeomorphism. Assume that $\varphi$ induces local coordinates $(x^1,...,x^n)$ , that means that $\forall p\in U$ , $\varphi(p)=(x^1(p),...,x^n(p))\in\mathbb{R}^n$ . Let $p\in U$ , then since $\varphi:U\subset M\rightarrow\varphi(U)\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ is an homeomorphism, then $(\varphi^{-1})_*|_{\varphi(p)}$ is an isomorphism of vector spaces: \begin{equation*} (\varphi^{-1})_*|_{\varphi(p)}:T_{\varphi(p)}\varphi(U)\cong T_{\varphi(p)}\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow T_pU\cong T_pM. \end{equation*} Let \begin{equation} \label{basis of TR} \left\{\frac{\partial}{\partial x^1}|_{\varphi(p)},...\frac{\partial}{\partial x^n}|_{\varphi(p)}\right\} \end{equation} be a basis of $T_{\varphi(p)}\mathbb{R}^n$ , then define \begin{equation*} \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}|_{p}:=(\varphi^{-1})_*|_{\varphi(p)}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}|_{\varphi(p)}\right). \end{equation*} By the fact that $(\varphi^{-1})_*|_{\varphi(p)}$ is an isomorphism, it maps basis into basis, hence \begin{equation*} \left\{\frac{\partial}{\partial x^1}|_{p},...,\frac{\partial}{\partial x^n}|_{p}\right\} \end{equation*} is a basis of $T_pM$ . In other words \begin{equation*} T_pM=\left\{V^i\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}|_{p}\mid V^i\in\mathbb{R}, \ i=1,...,n\right\}. \end{equation*} This means that any $V\in T_pM$ , there exist $\{V^i\}_{i=1}^n\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $V=V^i\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}|_{p}$ . Consider now a smooth vector field V of $M$ , i.e. $V\in\Gamma(TM)$ is a section of the tangent bundle $TM:=\coprod_{p\in M}T_pM$ , then $\forall p\in U$ , $V(p)\in T_pM$ , hence we can write $V(p)=V^i(p)\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}|_{p}$ , for some $V^i(p)\in\mathbb{R}$ , for $i=1,...,n$ . Since this can be done $\forall p\in U$ , we write locally \begin{equation*} V=V^i\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}, \end{equation*} where $V^i\in\mathcal{C}^\infty(M)$ are suitable smooth functions. The word locally means that $V(p)=V^i(p)\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}|_{p}$ only for $p\in U$ . Since $TM$ is a manifold by its own right we would like to define its charts. We can induce a charts of $TM$ by charts of $M$ in this way. Let $\pi:TM\rightarrow M$ be the projection of the bundle and take $V\in TM$ , with $\pi(V)=p\in U\subset M$ , then we have shown that we can write $V=V^i\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}|_p$ .

Let $(x^1,...,x^n,y^1,...,y^n)$ be the local coordinates induced by $\psi$ . Let $V\in \tilde{U}$ , then since $\psi:\tilde{U}\subset TM\rightarrow\psi(\tilde{U})\subset\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ is an homeomorphism, then $(\psi^{-1})_*|_{\psi(V)}$ is an isomorphism of vector spaces: \begin{equation*} (\psi^{-1})_*|_{\psi(V)}:T_{\psi(V)}\psi(\tilde{U})\cong T_{\psi(V)}\mathbb{R}^{2n}\rightarrow T_VT\tilde{U}\cong T_VTM. \end{equation*} Let \begin{equation} \label{basis of TTR} \left\{\frac{\partial}{\partial x^1}|_{\psi(V)},...\frac{\partial}{\partial x^n}|_{\psi(V)};\frac{\partial}{\partial y^1}|_{\psi(V)},...\frac{\partial}{\partial y^n}|_{\psi(V)}\right\} \end{equation} be a basis of $T_{\psi(V)}\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ , then define for $i=1,...,n$ \begin{equation*} \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}|_{V}:=(\psi^{-1})_*|_{\psi(V)}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}|_{\psi(V)}\right) \end{equation*} and \begin{equation*} \frac{\partial}{\partial y^i}|_{V}:=(\psi^{-1})_*|_{\psi(V)}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial y^i}|_{\psi(V)}\right). \end{equation*} By the fact that $(\psi^{-1})_*|_{\psi(V)}$ is an isomorphism, it maps basis into basis, hence \begin{equation*} \left\{\frac{\partial}{\partial x^1}|_{V},...,\frac{\partial}{\partial x^n}|_{V};\frac{\partial}{\partial y^1}|_{V},...,\frac{\partial}{\partial y^n}|_{V}\right\} \end{equation*} is a basis of $T_VTM$ . In other words \begin{equation*} T_VTM=\left\{\eta^i\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}|_{V}+\tilde{\eta}^j\frac{\partial}{\partial y^j}|_{V}\mid \eta^i,\tilde{\eta}^j\in\mathbb{R}, \ i,j=1,...,n\right\}. \end{equation*} Wikipedia instead says ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_tangent_bundle ): Since $(TM,\pi_{TM},M)$ is a vector bundle on its own right, its tangent bundle has the secondary vector bundle structure $(TTM,(\pi_{TM})_*,TM)$ , where $(\pi_{TM})_*:TTM\rightarrow TM$ is the push-forward of the canonical projection $\pi_{TM}:TM\rightarrow M$ . In the following we denote \begin{equation} \xi = \xi^k\frac{\partial}{\partial x^k}\Big|_x\in T_xM, \qquad X = X^k\frac{\partial}{\partial x^k}\Big|_x\in T_xM \end{equation} and apply the associated coordinate system \begin{equation} \xi \mapsto (x^1,\ldots,x^n,\xi^1,\ldots,\xi^n) \end{equation} on $TM$ . Then the fibre of the secondary vector bundle structure at $X\in T_xM$ takes the form \begin{equation} (\pi_{TM})^{-1}_*(X) = \Big\{ \ X^k\frac{\partial}{\partial x^k}\Big|_\xi + Y^k\frac{\partial}{\partial\xi^k}\Big|_\xi \ \Big| \ \xi\in T_xM \ , \ Y^1,\ldots,Y^n\in\mathbb{R} \ \Big\}. \end{equation} .

6,Determinant of the second fundamental form in Gauss's curvature,Determinant of the second fundamental form in Gauss's curvature,,"At this point on a Prof. Norman J Wildberger's presentation on Gauss's curvature and the the Theorema Egregium the curvature of a manifold $S$ at a point $p$ is written down as the determinant of the derivative map of Gauss-Rodrigues ( $N$ ) from $S$ to the 2-sphere of radius $1,$ $S^2,$ at that point: If $\vec r$ denotes the function from the parametric space to the surface $S,$ and $\mathrm dN$ the derivative of the Gauss map taking vectors from $T_pS$ to $T_{N(p)}S^2,$ the ratio of the determinant of the function composition $\mathrm dN\circ \vec r$ to the determinant of the function $\vec r$ is the Gauss curvature: $$K(p) = \det \mathrm dN(p)=\frac{\mathrm dA(S^2)}{\mathrm dA(S)}=\frac{\det\left(\mathrm dN\circ \vec r\right)}{\det \vec r}=\frac{eg-f^2}{EG-F^2}$$ Or the Jacobian of the transformation between the two patches in the following diagram: This is concordant with the first alternative formula : $$K =\frac{\det \mathrm {II}}{\det \mathrm I}$$ of the determinant of the second fundamental form (i.e. the component along the normal vector of the second partial derivative of $\vec r$ with respect to the basis vectors in the tangent plane) to the first fundamental forms (i.e. the metric tensor). Above the coefficients of the first fundamental form are $E=\langle r_u,r_u\rangle,$ $F=\langle r_u,r_v\rangle,$ $G=\langle r_v,r_v\rangle.$ The first fundamental form measures the distortion in lengths of the curves in the domain $(u,v),$ i.e. $L(\beta(t))=\int_0^t \vert \beta'(t)\vert dt=\int_0^t\left((u'(t)^2 + v'(t)^2\right)^{1/2}dt$ as compared to the charted curve on $S,$ i.e. $L(\alpha(t))=\int_0^t \vert\alpha'(t)\vert dt=\int_0^t \left(  u'(t)^2 E + 2 u'(t)v'(t) F + v'(t)^2 G \right)^{1/2}dt.$ Likewise it measures the distortion in the measurement of areas on $S$ through the determinant of the first fundamental form expressed as a matrix - $\det \begin{vmatrix}E&F\\F&G\end{vmatrix}=EG-F^2,$ i.e. the area of a $\vec r(V)$ patch on $S,$ corresponding to the image of a patch in $(u,v),$ is $A=\int_V \vert r_u \times r_v \vert du dv = \int_V \left(EG - F^2 \right)^{1/2}du dv.$ See here .

14,Diffeological isomorphisms between irrational tori.,Diffeological isomorphisms between irrational tori.,,"This is exercise 4 from chapter 1 of the book "" diffeology "" by Patrick Iglesias-Zemmour. Let $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\beta \in \mathbb{R}$ be irrational numbers. Define the irrational (non-commutative) torus $T_{\alpha} = \mathbb{R}/(\mathbb{Z}+ \alpha \mathbb{Z})$, and define $T_{\beta}$ analogously. Let $\pi_{\alpha}: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow T_{\alpha}$ be the canonical projection, and likewise for $\pi_{\beta}$. A diffeology on $T_{\alpha}$ is collection of maps $P: U \rightarrow T_{\alpha}$, where $U$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for some $n$. The members of the diffeology are called plots. The diffeology we would like to consider is the following. A map $P: U \rightarrow T_{\alpha}$ is a plot if for any $r \in U$, there exists an open neighborhood $V_{r}$ of $r$, and a smooth map $Q: V_{r} \rightarrow T_{\alpha}$ such that $\pi_{\alpha} \circ Q = P|_{V_{r}}$. In other words, the plots are the maps that locally factor through a smooth map $Q: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. We can endow $\mathbb{R}$ with a diffeology: the plots are the smooth maps. A map between diffeological spaces is smooth if it sends plots to plots. Claim: if $f: T_{\alpha} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is smooth, then $f$ is constant. Let me sketch a proof. If $f$ is to be smooth, then $f \circ \pi_{\alpha}: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ must be smooth. (This follows from the fact that $\pi_{\alpha}$ is a plot, and hence $f \circ \pi_{\alpha}$ must be a plot). If $f$ is non-constant, then $f \circ \pi_{\alpha}$ is non-continuous. This can be seen directly as follows. Let $t,t' \in T_{\alpha}$ such that $f(t) \neq f(t')$. Then we choose $\epsilon = |f(t) - f(t')|/2 > 0$. Now if $\delta > 0$, then there exist $x, x' \in \mathbb{R}$, with $|x - x'| < \delta$ and $\pi_{\alpha}(x) = t$ and $\pi_{\alpha}(x') = t'$, (this is because $\mathbb{Z} + \alpha \mathbb{Z}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$). Finally, we see $|f \circ \pi_{\alpha}(x) - f \circ \pi_{\alpha}(x')| = |f(t) - f(t')| > \epsilon$. Now comes the part that troubles me. Problem: Let $f: T_{\alpha} \rightarrow T_{\beta}$ be smooth. Then there exists some interval $J \subset \mathbb{R}$ and an affine map $F:J \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, such that $\pi_{\beta} \circ F = f \circ \pi_{\alpha}|_{J}$.

I had the thought of showing that the derivative of $Q:I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is constant, but I didn't really make any progress.","This is exercise 4 from chapter 1 of the book "" diffeology "" by Patrick Iglesias-Zemmour. Let $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\beta \in \mathbb{R}$ be irrational numbers. Define the irrational (non-commutative) torus $T_{\alpha} = \mathbb{R}/(\mathbb{Z}+ \alpha \mathbb{Z})$, and define $T_{\beta}$ analogously. Let $\pi_{\alpha}: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow T_{\alpha}$ be the canonical projection, and likewise for $\pi_{\beta}$. A diffeology on $T_{\alpha}$ is collection of maps $P: U \rightarrow T_{\alpha}$, where $U$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for some $n$. The members of the diffeology are called plots. The diffeology we would like to consider is the following. A map $P: U \rightarrow T_{\alpha}$ is a plot if for any $r \in U$, there exists an open neighborhood $V_{r}$ of $r$, and a smooth map $Q: V_{r} \rightarrow T_{\alpha}$ such that $\pi_{\alpha} \circ Q = P|_{V_{r}}$. In other words, the plots are the maps that locally factor through a smooth map $Q: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. We can endow $\mathbb{R}$ with a diffeology: the plots are the smooth maps. A map between diffeological spaces is smooth if it sends plots to plots. Claim: if $f: T_{\alpha} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is smooth, then $f$ is constant. Let me sketch a proof. If $f$ is to be smooth, then $f \circ \pi_{\alpha}: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ must be smooth. (This follows from the fact that $\pi_{\alpha}$ is a plot, and hence $f \circ \pi_{\alpha}$ must be a plot). If $f$ is non-constant, then $f \circ \pi_{\alpha}$ is non-continuous. This can be seen directly as follows. Let $t,t' \in T_{\alpha}$ such that $f(t) \neq f(t')$. Then we choose $\epsilon = |f(t) - f(t')|/2 > 0$. Now if $\delta > 0$, then there exist $x, x' \in \mathbb{R}$, with $|x - x'| < \delta$ and $\pi_{\alpha}(x) = t$ and $\pi_{\alpha}(x') = t'$, (this is because $\mathbb{Z} + \alpha \mathbb{Z}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$). Finally, we see $|f \circ \pi_{\alpha}(x) - f \circ \pi_{\alpha}(x')| = |f(t) - f(t')| > \epsilon$. Now comes the part that troubles me. Problem: Let $f: T_{\alpha} \rightarrow T_{\beta}$ be smooth. Then there exists some interval $J \subset \mathbb{R}$ and an affine map $F:J \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, such that $\pi_{\beta} \circ F = f \circ \pi_{\alpha}|_{J}$. Furthermore $F$ can be extended affinely to $\mathbb{R}$. I have some progress. Like before, if $f$ is smooth, then $f \circ \pi_{\alpha}: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow T_{\beta}$ is a plot. This means there exists an open interval $I$ and a smooth map $Q:I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, such that \begin{equation} f \circ \pi_{a}|_{I} = \pi_{\beta} \circ Q. \end{equation} My suspicion is that the map $Q$ is the map $F$ that we are after.

46,Local obstruction to having a complete extension,Local obstruction to having a complete extension,,"This question arose while I was reading Helgason's book on symmetric spaces. In chapter IV section 5, one can read the following: Let $M$ be a Riemannian manifold, $p$ a point in $M$ . In general it is impossible to find any neighborhood $N$ of $p$ which can be extended to a complete Riemannian manifold $\tilde{M}$ . To me this is very surprising. This means that there are local ""obstructions"" to the existence of a complete extension, so the completeness of a manifold $M$ impacts its local geometry. My first thought was that locally, say in a chart $B(0,\varepsilon)\subset \mathbf{R}^n\to  M$ , the metric doesn't vary to much from its value at $p$ . So maybe we can extend it to a metric on $\mathbf{R}^n$ using partitions of unity and we should be able to ask that the metric is the standard metric outside a ball $B(0,\varepsilon+r)$ . If this is possible I guess it would give a complete metric on $\mathbf{R}^n$ (here I'm probably wrong). But apparently this is not going to work. Hence my question is: What are some examples of manifolds $M$ and point $p$ of $M$ such that no neighborhood of $p$ can extend to a complete manifold ? From Helgason's book I know that locally symmetric spaces have these neighborhoods that extend to a complete manifold. Any kind of help will be greatly appreciated.

Also, my level of academic mathematical language do not cover fibre bundles or more complex structures than the intuitive notion of tangent and cotangent bundles. So, the author in $[1]$ said explicitly the following stroked in red: Then, the whole well-know fact that Christoffel symbols aren't tensors has sinked into a whirlpool of confusion. This whirlpool of confusion is due to the classical tensor analysis realization; which we check that the christoffel symbols in fact do not transform like a tensor object. Furthermore other authors have pointed out this fact of a true tensor nature, of the Christoffel symbols, before: $[2]$ , $[3]$ . The thing is, if they form a components of a $(1,1)-tensor$ $[1]$ , then there must to be such abstract object which is the ""pure"" tensor: $$\Gamma = \Gamma^{a}_{b} dx^{b} \otimes \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{a}} \tag{1}$$ Well, the fact is, concerning the realization of $[1]$ when he said: one for each basis vector $\vec{e}_{\nu}$ this motivated me to write a notation for this phrase: $$ \Gamma^{a}_{(\cdot)b} \tag{2}$$ Where the dot means that, when we put a basis vector $\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{j}}$ we get on return $[2]$ : $$ \Gamma^{a}_{(\cdot)b}\Big(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{j}}\Big)\equiv \Gamma^{a}_{jb} =: dx^{a}\Big( \nabla_{\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{b}}}\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{j}} \Big) \tag{3}$$ On the other hand, a mathematical fact is that, a Christoffel Symbol can be calculated precisely as $(3)$ . So, if we omit the basis vector $j$ , then we have, in fact, an operator: $$\Gamma^{a}_{(\cdot)b}: \mathfrak{X}(M) \to C^{\infty}(M)  $$ $$ \Gamma^{a}_{(\cdot)b}=: dx^{a}\Big( \nabla_{\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{b}}} (\cdot)\Big) \tag{4}$$ Or, more gently: $$\Gamma^{a}_{(\cdot)b}: T_{p}M \to \mathbb{R}  $$ . Now, for the tensor transformation law I tried to prove and I get, nicely, a result which is the true tensor law: Consider then the symbols in a coordinate chart $C'$ . $$ \Gamma'^{a'}_{(\cdot)b'} = \Gamma'^{a'}_{b'} \tag{5}$$ Where in $(5)$ is just a change of notation. Then we perfom a change of coordinates to another chart $C \to C'$ Then the Symbols transforms as: $$\Gamma'^{a'}_{b'} = dx'^{a'}\Big( \nabla_{\frac{\partial}{\partial x'^{b'}}} (\cdot)\Big)  = \frac{\partial x'^{a'}}{\partial x^{c}}dx^{c}\Bigg( \nabla_{\frac{\partial x^{d}}{\partial x^{b'}}\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{d}}} (\cdot)\Bigg) = $$ $$ = \frac{\partial x'^{a'}}{\partial x^{c}}\frac{\partial x^{d}}{\partial x^{b'}}dx^{c}\Bigg( \nabla_{\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{d}}} (\cdot)\Bigg) =\frac{\partial x'^{a'}}{\partial x^{c}}\frac{\partial x^{d}}{\partial x^{b'}} \Gamma^{c}_{d}  \tag{6} $$ So indeed the symbols transforms like a tensor, then with an abuse of notation, we can say that ""Christoffel symbols"" transforms like a tensor. The subtle fact is: for every basis vector we have an Christoffel Symbols; therefore the whole symbol $(3)$ do not transform indeed. But since we have the $\Gamma^{a}_{b}$ , and it's tensor nature, we can therefore say that they form components of the Christoffel Tensor . Then, we can indeed conclude it's abstract form $(1)$ .

I looked on the web a lot but quickly got lost because there are so many suggestions and most people simply want introductions and I'm not prepared to buy a huge textbook based on someone's review of it only to discover that it wasn't what I hoped for. So..if someone recommends a certain textbook..Kindly say what's good or not good about it..of course I'm not expecting to find a perfect one I only want to find one that's not very different from what I have in mind.

55,Question on Teichmuller metric as infimum of the dilatations,Question on Teichmuller metric as infimum of the dilatations,,"I'm learning Teichmuller theory from the book ""Primer on Mapping class group"". There is something I can not understand, I hope someone could clarify it. Let $\mathcal{T}_g$ be the Teichmuller space of closed Riemann surfaces of genus $g\ge 2$. The authors say that, given two marked Riemann surfaces $(X_1,f_1:S_g\rightarrow X_1),(X_2,f_2:S_g\rightarrow X_2)\in \mathcal{T}_g$, their Teichmuller distance (which I write as $d_{\mathcal{T}}(X_1,X_2)$) is defined as the infimum of the dilatations of the quasi-conformal maps homotopic to the change of markings $f_2\circ f_1^{-1}:X_1\rightarrow X_2$. This fact suggest that the dilatation of the quasi-conformal maps should be calculated in the coordinates of the conformal atlases of $X_1$ and $X_2$.  Then, by the two Teichmuller's theorems (existence and unicity of Teichmuller map) we get that this infimum is realized by the Teichmuller map between $X_1$ and $X_2$. The proof of the Teichmuller's unicity theorem relies on the fact that the Teichmuller map is affine in the natural coordinates of some quadratic differentials $q_1$ (on $X_1$) and $q_2$ (on $X_2$) and that its horizontal stretch factor is $\sqrt{K}$ and its vertical stretch factor is $1/\sqrt{K}$ ($K>1$) and so the dilatation is $K$. So we get that $d_{\mathcal{T}}(X_1,X_2)$ equals the dilatation of the Teichmuller map (for the quadratic differentials $q_1$ and $q_2$) computed in the natural coordinates of $q_1$ and $q_2$.

In other words, the current counterpart $\mathbf M$ can be viewed as a $\mathbf explicit function$ of the rotation $\mathbf R \in SO(3) $. Let $\mathbf \delta \omega$ be the spatial spin (an element which belongs to the tangent space of SO(3) at the base point $\mathbf R$, i.e., $\mathbf \delta \omega \in T_{R}SO(3)$). Then the virtual work done by the torque over the spin is given by $$\delta W = \mathbf M \cdot \delta \omega$$ where $\delta W $ is a real number, and ""$\cdot$"" means dot product. In mathematics, $\mathbf M$ is an element of cotangent space of SO(3) at the base point $\mathbf R$, i.e., $\mathbf M \in T^{*}_{R}SO(3)$. On the other hand, if the rotation vector (axis-angle representation) $\mathbf \psi = \psi_{i} \mathbf e_{i}$ was used to parameterize the rotation manifold, $\mathbf R = exp(\hat \psi)$, then we can express the torque as $\mathbf M=\mathbf Q \mathbf M_0$ explicitly, where $\mathbf Q=\mathbf Q(\psi)$ is the transformation matrix relating the initial and current values of the torque. We also can represent the virtual rotation by $\mathbf \delta \psi$, the variation of rotation vector $\mathbf \psi$, $\mathbf \delta \psi \in T_{I}SO(3)$. The relation between $\mathbf \delta \omega$ and $\mathbf \delta \psi$ is given by $ \delta \omega = \mathbf L \delta \psi$, where $\mathbf L= \mathbf L(\psi)$ is the tangential operator, $\mathbf L:T_ISO(3)\to T_RSO(3)$.

64,Identifying the cotangent bundle of the flag variety,Identifying the cotangent bundle of the flag variety,,"Suppose $G$ is a Lie group (or I guess a linear algebraic group), $P \subset G$ a Lie subgroup with Lie algebras $\mathfrak{g}$ and $\mathfrak{p}$ respectively. In Chriss and Ginzburg's book ""Representation theory and complex geometry"" they have the following result (Lemma 1.4.9): There is a natural $G$-equivariant isomorphism   $$ T^*(G/P) \cong G \times_P \mathfrak{p}^\perp $$   where $\mathfrak{p}^\perp$ is the annihilator of $\mathfrak{p}$ in $\mathfrak{g}^*$ and $P$ acts on $\mathfrak{p}^\perp$ by the coadjoint action. They give a proof however I don't understand it at all. I will will reproduce it for convenience below (with some annotations that are my own!). I was hoping someone could help me fill in the details. I am actually interested in the algebraic version of the result but help understanding the proof in either the differential category or the algebraic one would be very useful! Proof . Let $e = 1 \cdot P/P \in G/P$ be the base point. We have $T_e(G/P) = \mathfrak{g}/\mathfrak{p}$ and $T_e^*(G/P) = (\mathfrak{g}/\mathfrak{p})^* = \mathfrak{p}^\perp \subset \mathfrak{g}^*$. ( NOTE: ok up to here I understand, but the rest I have no idea ). It follows that, for any $g \in G$ $$T_{g \cdot e}^*(G/P) = g\mathfrak{p}^\perp g^{-1}. $$ Question 1: So I understand that somehow I am meant to be able to transfer the tangent space at $e$ to the point $g \cdot e$ using the $G$ action but I'm unsure how to write this down. This shows that the vector bundles $T^*(G/P)$ and $ G \times_P \mathfrak{p}^\perp $ have the same fibers at each point of $G/P$, hence are equal as sets ( NOTE: ok I am happy with this if I can understand the above ). To prove that they are isomorphic as manifolds, one can refine the argument as follows. Consider the trivial bundle $\mathfrak{g}_{G/P} = G/P \times \mathfrak{g}$ on $G/P$ with fiber $\mathfrak{g}$. The infinitesimal $\mathfrak{g}$-action on $G/P$ gives rise to a vector bundle morphism $\mathfrak{g}_{G/P} \longrightarrow T(G/P)$. Question 2: I understand that each element of the Lie algebra $X \in \mathfrak{g}$ gives rise to a vector field $\xi_X$, is the image of $(gP,X)$ under this map simply $\xi_X(gP)$? It is clear that the kernel of this morphism is the sub bundle $E \subset \mathfrak{g}_{G/P}$ whose fiber at a point $x \in G/P$ is the isotropy Lie algebra $\mathfrak{p}_x \subset \mathfrak{g}$ at $x$. This gives an isomorphism $T(G/P) \cong \mathfrak{g}_{G/P}/E$.

( NOTE: That I am happy with ).","Suppose $G$ is a Lie group (or I guess a linear algebraic group), $P \subset G$ a Lie subgroup with Lie algebras $\mathfrak{g}$ and $\mathfrak{p}$ respectively. In Chriss and Ginzburg's book ""Representation theory and complex geometry"" they have the following result (Lemma 1.4.9): There is a natural $G$-equivariant isomorphism   $$ T^*(G/P) \cong G \times_P \mathfrak{p}^\perp $$   where $\mathfrak{p}^\perp$ is the annihilator of $\mathfrak{p}$ in $\mathfrak{g}^*$ and $P$ acts on $\mathfrak{p}^\perp$ by the coadjoint action. They give a proof however I don't understand it at all. I will will reproduce it for convenience below (with some annotations that are my own!). I was hoping someone could help me fill in the details. I am actually interested in the algebraic version of the result but help understanding the proof in either the differential category or the algebraic one would be very useful! Proof . Let $e = 1 \cdot P/P \in G/P$ be the base point. We have $T_e(G/P) = \mathfrak{g}/\mathfrak{p}$ and $T_e^*(G/P) = (\mathfrak{g}/\mathfrak{p})^* = \mathfrak{p}^\perp \subset \mathfrak{g}^*$. ( NOTE: ok up to here I understand, but the rest I have no idea ). It follows that, for any $g \in G$ $$T_{g \cdot e}^*(G/P) = g\mathfrak{p}^\perp g^{-1}. $$ Question 1: So I understand that somehow I am meant to be able to transfer the tangent space at $e$ to the point $g \cdot e$ using the $G$ action but I'm unsure how to write this down. This shows that the vector bundles $T^*(G/P)$ and $ G \times_P \mathfrak{p}^\perp $ have the same fibers at each point of $G/P$, hence are equal as sets ( NOTE: ok I am happy with this if I can understand the above ). To prove that they are isomorphic as manifolds, one can refine the argument as follows. Consider the trivial bundle $\mathfrak{g}_{G/P} = G/P \times \mathfrak{g}$ on $G/P$ with fiber $\mathfrak{g}$. The infinitesimal $\mathfrak{g}$-action on $G/P$ gives rise to a vector bundle morphism $\mathfrak{g}_{G/P} \longrightarrow T(G/P)$. Question 2: I understand that each element of the Lie algebra $X \in \mathfrak{g}$ gives rise to a vector field $\xi_X$, is the image of $(gP,X)$ under this map simply $\xi_X(gP)$? It is clear that the kernel of this morphism is the sub bundle $E \subset \mathfrak{g}_{G/P}$ whose fiber at a point $x \in G/P$ is the isotropy Lie algebra $\mathfrak{p}_x \subset \mathfrak{g}$ at $x$. This gives an isomorphism $T(G/P) \cong \mathfrak{g}_{G/P}/E$.

Well, Spivak defines on his book that if $(x,U)$ is a chart on a smooth manifold $M$ and if $f : U \to \Bbb R$ is differentiable, then we can define the $i$-th partial with respect to this chart as: $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}(p)=D_i(f\circ x^{-1})(x(p))$$ This is very natural and very good, but I started to think on ways to compute with this. Indeed, I'm studying Spivak's Differential Geometry books, but in addition to the theory, I'm trying to get the way to compute things. So my thought was: following the question I've refered, if I can express any function $f : U \to \Bbb R$ as combination of the coordinate functions with usual functions defined on the real line, then I can take any partials if I know the partials of the coordinate functions. Indeed, I computed as follows: $$\frac{\partial x^i}{\partial x^j}(p)=D_j(x^i \circ x^{-1})(x(p))$$ But I've defined $x^i=I^i \circ x$ where $I:\Bbb R^n \to \Bbb R$ is the identity. So we have that: $$x^i\circ x^{-1}=(I^i\circ x)\circ x^{-1}$$ But composition is associative, and since $x : U\to \Bbb R^n$ and $x^{-1} : x(U)\subset \Bbb R^n \to U $ we have that $x \circ x^{-1} : x(U)\subset \Bbb R^n \to \Bbb R^n$ and this is just the identity $I$, so that $(I^i \circ x)\circ x^{-1} = I^i$ and so $$\frac{\partial x^i}{\partial x^j}(p)=D_jI^i(x(p))$$ But we know that $D_jI^i(q) = \delta_j^i$ independent of the point, where $\delta^i_j$ is the Kronecker Delta.

70,Describing Functions on a Manifold,Describing Functions on a Manifold,,"Well, I have a pretty simple (probably silly and basic) doubt about how do we describe functions on a Manifold.

A chart for a manifold $M$ is a pair $(x,U)$ with $U\subset M$ and $x : U \to \Bbb R^n$, if two charts overlap smoothly we say that they're $C^\infty$ related and a collection of $C^\infty$ related charts is an atlas for $M$. In that setting, a smooth manifold is a pair $(M,\mathcal{A})$ where $M$ is a topological manifold and $\mathcal{A}$ is one maximal atlas for $M$. So if I understood, providing a chart $(x,U)$ to a manifold $M$ is a way to introduce ""coordinates"" on $M$. Indeed, if $I : \Bbb R^n\to \Bbb R$ is the identity function we define $x^i = I^i \circ x$ to be the ""$i$-th coordinate function"" on $U$. In that case, for each $p \in U$ we have the coordinates $(x^1(p), \cdots, x^n(p))$ and if I understood correctly this is a way to allow us to bring to abstract spaces the usual notions of analysis over $\Bbb R^n$ (of course, in a refined manner, so that it fits the generality of the situation). Now the real question: this all led me to a doubt - how do we describe functions on a manifold? Well, this question might seem strange, but there's a point, if we work with $\Bbb R^n$, then each $a \in \Bbb R^n$ is an $n$-tuple of reals $a = (a^1,\dots, a^n)$ and so we can describe functions $f : \Bbb R^n \to \Bbb R$ by combining functions defined on $\Bbb R$ applied on each $a^i$. Indeed, we have the identity $I^i(a) = a^i$, and so we can easily define for instance $f : \Bbb R^2 \to \Bbb R$ by: $$f = \sin \circ I^1 - \sqrt{(I^1)^2 - (I^2)^2}$$ Now at a point $(a,b) \in \Bbb R^2$ we would have then: $$f(a,b)= \sin(I^1(a,b))-\sqrt{(I^1(a,b))^2-(I^2(a,b))^2}=\sin a-\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$$ So, to define the function $f(x,y)=\sin x - \sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ we can simply combine functions from $\Bbb R$ to $\Bbb R$ using the component functions of the identity function. My understanding is: we know how to build functions from $\Bbb R^n$ to $\Bbb R$ because we implicitly construct these combinations of functions constructed on $\Bbb R$ and the components of $I$. Now, on an arbitrary manifold, points are not necessarily $n$-tuples of numbers. The projective plane for instance is the set of all lines through the origin of $\Bbb R^n$, so although charts provide $n$-tuples for each point, each point is not itself one $n$-tuple, so the construction of functions from one arbitrary manifold to $\Bbb R$ would not be simply like that. But now here comes my understanding: we simply use the coordinate functions, exactly to work as we do in $\Bbb R^n$! For instance, let's suppose that $M$ is a smooth manifold of dimension $2$ and that $(x,U)$ is a chart, in that case $x : U \to \Bbb R^2$ and we have two coordinate functions $x^1 = I^1 \circ x$ and $x^2 = I^2 \circ x$, and with this we can express any function $f : U \to \Bbb R^2$ simply by combining $x^1$ and $x^2$ with usual functions defined on $\Bbb R$! For instance: $$f=\sin \circ x^1 - \cos \circ x^2$$ So that given $p \in U$ we would have $f(p) = \sin(x^1(p)) - \cos(x^2(p))$ which we would know how to compute. So is all of this correct? Is really this way that we usually set up functions on arbitrary manifolds? Is this the correct way to use charts on a manifold to work with it?

For instance: $$f=\sin \circ x^1 - \cos \circ x^2$$ So that given $p \in U$ we would have $f(p) = \sin(x^1(p)) - \cos(x^2(p))$ which we would know how to compute. So is all of this correct? Is really this way that we usually set up functions on arbitrary manifolds? Is this the correct way to use charts on a manifold to work with it?

So, I tried to rewrite things as much as possible using only ""natural operations"" on the tangent bundle, like Lie-derivative, exterior derivative etc. Of course, I didn't succeed (and any articles I tried to search online were too abstract to understand), so what I did was expand the total time derivative: \begin{align} \dfrac{\partial L}{\partial q^i} - \left[\dfrac{\partial^2 L}{\partial q^j\partial \dot{q}^i}\dot{q}^j + \dfrac{\partial^2 L}{\partial \dot{q}^j\partial \dot{q}^i}\ddot{q}^j \right] &= 0. \end{align} This gave me the idea that perhaps thinking of the Lagrangian, $L$ , as a function on the tangent bundle $TQ \to \Bbb{R}$ is perhaps not the most appropriate/natural setting. It seems that the tangent bundle only has coordinates $(q, \dot{q})$ , whereas the Euler-Lagrange equations which are second order differential equations, involving $\ddot{q}$ . So, it seemed to me that it would be nice to construct a new manifold $M$ , from the original ""configuration manifold"" $Q$ , so that on the new manifold $M$ , we have local coordinates $(q^i, \dot{q}^i, \ddot{q}^i)$ , for $1 \leq i \leq n$ . To formalize this idea of introducing a larger manifold with extra coordinates for higher derivatives, my plan was to mimic the construction of $TQ$ as much as possible. Let $k \geq 1$ be an integer and let $Q$ be a smooth manifold modeled on a Banach space $E$ . Now, we define a relation $\sim_k$ on the set of all smooth curves $\gamma:I \to Q$ , where $I$ is an open set in $\Bbb{R}$ containing $0$ , by declaring $\gamma_1 \sim_k \gamma_2$ if and only if there is a chart $(U, \alpha)$ of $Q$ such that (the composition below makes sense and) for every $r \in \{0, \dots, k\}$ , we have \begin{align} (\alpha \circ \gamma_1)^{(r)}(0) &= (\alpha \circ \gamma_2)^{(r)}(0). \end{align} A tedious, but straight forward induction exercise and chain rule shows that this relation doesn't depend on the choice of chart $(U, \alpha)$ , so we're actually justified with using the notation $\sim_k$ without referencing the chart. This is also an equivalence relation. For the lack of a better name, I shall denote the quotient set of equivalence classes as \begin{align} C^kQ := (\text{smooth curves in $Q$})/\sim_k, \end{align} and I shall call it ""the $k^{th}$ order contact manifold of curves in $Q$ "" . Given a smooth curve $\gamma$ , we shall indicate the equivalence class either as $C^k\gamma$ or $[\gamma]$ , whichever is more convenient. Next, I outline how I put a manifold structure. I realized that this space has quite a bit of structure: we can define a projection map $\pi_k : C^kQ \to Q$ by sending $C^k \gamma \mapsto \gamma(0)$ . We can even make this into a smooth manifold as follows: given a chart $(U, \alpha)$ on $Q$ , we define the chart $(C^kU, C^k \alpha)$ by defining $C^kU := \pi_k^{-1}[U]$ and $C^k \alpha : C^kU \to \alpha[U] \times E^k$ , \begin{align} C^k \alpha([\gamma]) &:= \left( (\alpha \circ \gamma)(0), (\alpha \circ \gamma)'(0), \dots (\alpha \circ \gamma)^{k}(0) \right) \end{align} This is a well-defined map because of how the equivalence relation was defined. It is also easily seen to be a bijective map, and also, if $(V, \beta)$ is another chart on $Q$ with $U \cap V \neq \emptyset$ , then using the chain rule, it is straightforward (though tedious) to seem that $(C^k \beta) \circ (C^k \alpha)^{-1}$ is a smooth map between open subsets of Banach spaces. Also, I only just recently read up about fiber bundles, but I believe that based on what I've constructed, we have that $\pi_k :C^kQ \to Q$ is a fiber bundle, with typical fiber $E^k$ , whereby the maps $C^k\alpha$ defined above provide us with the local trivializations. Is this the correct way of using the terminology? Here are my questions: Have people considered such spaces $C^kQ$ ? Are they interesting manifolds to study, and am I right in thinking that these manifolds would be a more appropriate setting to formulate Lagrangian mechanics? I believe that this is true, because if for some reason we decided to consider a Lagrangian which depends on higher derivatives of the curve, then the tangent bundle alone is insufficient to capture such information. In any case, I would appreciate some confirmation/denial along with references (if any). Is it possible to formulate the Euler-Lagrange equations in a coordinate-free manner, perhaps using such spaces? If yes, I'd appreciate some references (which hopefully aren't too abstract). For $k=1$ , this construction yields precisely the tangent bundle, in which case, the fiber over each point $x \in Q$ , namely $T_xQ$ can be given a natural vector space structure. However, for $k>1$ , am I right in saying that we cannot endow each fiber with a vector space structure? Of course, if we choose a particular chart $(U, \alpha)$ , we can establish a bijection between the fiber $\pi_k^{-1}(\{x\})$ and $E^k$ , and hence inherit a vector space structure that way, but I believe that this is not a chart-independent construction.

I have a feeling that the answer to this question can't be unknown, but I haven't found a proof or reference for it until now.","W : \Bbb{R}^n \to \Bbb{R}_+ n \alpha_1,...,\alpha_n  d(\xi_i,\xi_j)=\inf\left\{\int_0^1 \sqrt{W(\gamma(t))}| \gamma'(t)|dt : \gamma \in C^1([0,1];\Bbb{R}^n), \gamma(0)=\xi_i,\ \gamma(1)=\xi_j\right\} \sigma_{ij}>0,\ i \neq j \sigma_{ij}=\sigma_{ji} \sigma_{ij} \leq \sigma_{ik}+\sigma_{kj},i,j,k=1,...,n \alpha_i, i=1..n W d(\alpha_i,\alpha_j)=\sigma_{ij} \sigma_{ij} \Bbb{R}^n W_n d^n(\alpha_i,\alpha_j) \sigma_{ij} \Bbb{R}^n n 1 f K [\alpha_i,\alpha_j] \sigma_{ij} f \Bbb{R}^N \sqrt{W_\varepsilon(x)}=f(x)+\frac{1}{\varepsilon}d(x,K) \Gamma d^\varepsilon(\alpha_i,\alpha_j) W_\varepsilon \varepsilon \to 0 \sigma_{ij} \alpha_i,\alpha_j W_\varepsilon d^\varepsilon(\alpha_i,\alpha_j) \to \sigma_{ij}  W(x)=\prod_{i=1}^n |x-\alpha_i|^2 \cdot \sum_{1\leq i<j \leq n} a_{ij}x_i^2x_i^2  \sigma_{ij} a_{ij}","['differential-geometry', 'metric-spaces']"
99,What is the geometric explanation for why the shape operator is symmetric?,What is the geometric explanation for why the shape operator is symmetric?,,"The shape operator at acts on the tangent space of a manifold at $p$ : $S_p: T_pM \rightarrow T_pM$ By: $$S_p(v) = D_v(n(p))$$ That is, it sends the normal vector at $p$ to it's directional derivative in the direction of the input vector. The proof that this map is symmetric follows easily from the fact that partial derivatives commute, but I was hoping that somebody here could tell me why the geometric reason why this map is symmetric w.r.t. an inner product on the tangent space: $$S_p(V) \cdot U = V \cdot S_p(U)$$ The eigenvalues of this map are the principle curvatures and the direction of the eigenvectors are the principle directions.","The shape operator at acts on the tangent space of a manifold at : By: That is, it sends the normal vector at to it's directional derivative in the direction of the input vector.
