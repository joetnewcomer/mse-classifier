14,Does Every Subset of a Separable Topological Space have Countably Many Isolated Points?,Does Every Subset of a Separable Topological Space have Countably Many Isolated Points?,,"This is almost certainly a duplicate, but I keep seeing this result on metric spaces, not topological ones. Let $(X,\tau)$ be a topology. A set $A\subset X$ is dense if $A\cap B\neq\emptyset$ for all $B\in\tau$ . We say $(X,\tau)$ is separable if there exists a countable, dense $A\subseteq X$ . Given some $A\subseteq X$ , a point $p\in A$ is an isolated point in $A$ if there exists $O\in\tau$ such that $p\in O$ and $O\cap A=\{p\}$ . I am wondering: If $X$ is separable and $A\subseteq X$ , then must the set of isolated points in $A$ be at most countable? Perhaps if we add the condition that it is Hausdorff it is true. My attempt: If $A$ has $0$ or $1$ isolated points, we are done. Otherwise, let $p_{1},p_{2}\in A$ be isolated points of $A$ . Then there exist $O_{1},O_{2}\in\tau$ such that $O_{1}\cap A=\{p_{1}\}$ and $O_{2}\cap A=\{p_{2}\}$ . Furthermore, because $(X,\tau)$ is Hausdorff, there exist $T_{1},T_{2}\in\tau$ such that $p_{1}\in T_{1},p_{2}\in T_{2}$ , and $T_{1}\cap T_{2}=\emptyset$ . Now, because open sets are closed under finite intersection, we have that $O_{1}\cap T_{1}$ and $O_{2}\cap T_{2}$ are open, disjoint sets which have intersection $\{p_{1}\}$ and $\{p_{2}\}$ with $A$ , respectively. My idea from here is to well order some countable dense subset and use the well-ordering to choose one element from each open set around each isolated point (without using choice because we can just choose the least element). But I have yet to show that there exists a collection of disjoint open sets, one for each isolated point. I am not sure how to continue. For example, the result is true in the reals for closed sets by Cantor-Bendixon (I think).

Maybe a weird question, but: Let $A$ be a set s.t. it is possible to endow $A$ with 2 different smooth (or topological or $C^k$ or possibly even holomorphic/complex/Kähler or whatever) manifold structures. Endow $A$ with 2 different smooth manifold structures $\mathscr F$ and $\mathscr G$ to get, resp, $(A,\mathscr F)$ and $(A,\mathscr G)$ . If $(A,\mathscr F)$ and $(A,\mathscr G)$ have respective dimensions $f$ and $g$ , then is $f=g$ ? Edit: Note: Oh right so I really mean that $A$ is a set and not a topological manifold, so the way $(A,\mathscr F)$ and $(A,\mathscr G)$ are topological manifolds in the 1st place are that they are based on the same topological structure i.e. they are based on the same topology that makes the set $A$ into a topological space (and then this topological space is indeed a topological manifold). What I have in mind: So, like, there are many smooth (or whatever) manifold structures on $\mathbb R^n$ , but I'm wondering if they all make $\mathbb R^n$ a smooth $n$ -manifold. Perhaps there's some wild smooth manifold structure to make $\mathbb R^n$ locally $\mathbb R^{n-1}$ (i guess in the 1st place, such structure would be s.t. the topological structure makes $\mathbb R^n$ locally $\mathbb R^{n-1}$ ). I think of something like $\mathbb R^n$ and $\mathbb R^{n-1}$ as diffeomorphic/homeomorphic, but then it's not under the standard manifold or even topological structures. I believe there's a rule that says for $(A,\mathscr F)$ to be a smooth $f$ -manifold, we must have $f$ equal to the same dimension $h$ that allows us to say in the 1st place $(A,\mathscr F)$ is a topological $h$ -manifold.

I am looking for clarification on some parts (to be honest, most parts) of the proof. My comments and questions in bold refer to the statement above. $\textbf{Theorem}$. Suppose $Y \subseteq X$. A subset $E$ of $Y$ is open relative to $Y$ if and only if $E = Y \cap G$ for some open subset $G$ of $X$. $Proof.$ $(\Rightarrow)$ Suppose $E$ is open relative to $Y$. To each $p \in E,\ \exists r_p >0$ such that $$d(p,q) < r_p,\ q \in Y \Rightarrow q \in E.$$ Let $V_p$ be the set of all $q \in X$ such that $d(p,q) < r_p$ and define $G = \cup _{p \in E}\ V_p$. Why do this? Just because is works? Then $G$ is an open subset of $X$. $G$ is an open subset of $X$ because arbitrary union of open sets is open. Right? Since $p \in V_p\ \forall p \in E$,  it is clear that $E \subseteq G \cap Y.$ This is not ""clear"" like my professor states, please explain. By our choice of $V_p$, we have $V_p \cap E \subseteq E$ for every $p \in E$ so that $G \cap Y \subseteq E$. This makes sense in my head if I think in terms of sets in general. It's always true that the intersection of two sets is a subset of each of the sets, so it's no different in this case. BUT the words ""by our choice"" is bothering me, should it? Lastly, I don't understand why the intersection of $G$ and $Y$ would be a subset of $E$. Hence, $E = G \cap Y$. $(\Leftarrow)$ Conversely, if $G$ is open in $X$ and $E = G \cap Y$, every $p \in E$ has a neighborhood $V_p \subseteq G$. Then, $$V_p \cap Y \subseteq E$$ so that $E$ is open relative to $Y$. $□$ Thank you all in advance for the help.",,"['real-analysis', 'general-topology']"
89,Showing the standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$ has a countable basis,Showing the standard topology on  has a countable basis,\mathbb{R},"I would like to show that the standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$ has a countable basis. As far as I understand, the standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$ is generated by open intervals. So I can construct one basis as $\{(i,i+1),(i+1/2,i+3/2)\}$ for $i\in\mathbb{Z}$ which is clearly countable. EDITED: Thanks to Mees de Vries for pointing it out that my example is not a base. So is there any better way to construct a base? Is it okay to construct one basis to show the existence of a basis? Or is there way to show in general without constructing a specific example? Could somebody please give some light on this? Thanks.","I would like to show that the standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$ has a countable basis.

(2)My second question is somewhat broad, but maybe someone can shed some light on it. My intuition with why certain functions are continous comes from metric spaces. But, given a function like the one in the example below how can one see intuitively if it is continuous? Example 2. Consider $\mathbb R^\omega$, the countably infinite product of $\mathbb R$ with itself. Recall that $$\mathbb R^\omega = \prod_{n \in \mathbb Z_+} X_n,$$ where $X_n = \mathbb R$ for each $n$. Let us define a function $f : \mathbb R \to \mathbb R^\omega$ by the equation $$f(t) = (t, t, t, \dotsc)$$; the $n$th coordinate function of $f$ is the function $f_n(t) = t$. Each of the coordinate functions $f_n : \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ is continuous; therefore, the function $f$ is continuous if $\mathbb R^\omega$ is given the product topology. But $f$ is not continuous if $\mathbb R^\omega$ is given the box topology. Consider, for example, the basis element $$B = (-1, 1) \times (-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}) \times (-\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}) \times \dotsb$$ for the box topology. We assert that $f^{-1}(B)$ is not open in $\mathbb R$. If $f^{-1}(B)$ were open in $\mathbb R$, it would contain some interval $(-\delta, \delta)$ about the point $0$. This would mean that $f((-\delta, \delta)) \subset B$, so that, applying $\pi_n$ to both sides of the inclusion, $$f_n(-\delta, \delta)) = (-\delta, \delta) \subset (-1/n, 1/n)$$ for all $n$, a contradiction.","I have two question regarding the following example in Munkres (1)Why ""if $f^{-1}(B)$ were open it would contain some interval $(-\delta,\delta)$ about 0.
