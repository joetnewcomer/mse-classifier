12,Domain of composition of functions,Domain of composition of functions,,"I'm teaching a precalculus course and was wanting to let my students try to solve the following problem. If $$ f(x)=\sqrt{x}, g(x)=\frac{x}{x-1},h(x)=\sqrt[3]{x} $$ Find the domain of $$f\circ g\circ h $$ We have the following. $$ (f\circ g\circ h)(x)=f(g(\sqrt[3]{x}))=f(\frac{\sqrt[3]{x}}{\sqrt[3]{x}-1})=\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt[3]{x}}{\sqrt[3]{x}-1}} $$ Here is where things get interesting. To find the domain of this function, I need to find where $$ \frac{\sqrt[3]{x}}{\sqrt[3]{x}-1}\geq0 $$ And this happens when the numerator and denominator have the same sign. Solving the inequality gives me that 0 and 1 are critical points, so I have the following intervals to test for the domain $$ (-\infty,0),(0,1),(1,\infty) $$ Testing points in each interval shows that only the middle interval doesn't satisfy the inequality. Thus, the domain of the composition is $$ (-\infty,0],(1,\infty) $$ However, when I double check this with Wolframalpha and with Symbolab, they both tell me the domain is $$ \{0\}\cup(1,\infty) $$ I have double checked my work, and even just blindly inputting test values such as -1 gives me a valid output, so I'm wondering what is going on?

I still carry the same confusion (which really bugs me) but I think the real confusion has to do with the square root and principal square root. I hope I can finally grasp the concept with the following two questions... Question 1: $\sqrt{12x^2} = \sqrt{4\cdot3x^2} = 2|x|\sqrt{3}$ Why do we only have to keep in mind that $x$ could be negative, yet we just factorize $\sqrt{12}$ to $\sqrt{3\cdot4}$ and put the 2 right in front of the radical sign? $\sqrt{12}$ could be factorized as $\sqrt{-3 \cdot -4}$ as well. Question 2: I've been told to take the square root of both sides in the following equation, but the square root doesn't have its own symbol right? Only the principal root does... So if you'd use the radical sign you're using the principal root and therefore you're missing out on a solution in the following scenario: $(x + 8)² = 1 \iff \sqrt{(x + 8)^2} = \sqrt1 \iff x + 8 = 1 \iff x = -7$ Does that mean that whenever we want to take the square root of something (not the principal) we just use a $\pm$ symbol instead?

Let, $$m,n,r,s \in\mathbb {Z}.$$ We have: $$\frac{m-n\sqrt{5}} {r-s\sqrt{5}} =\frac{17+15\sqrt{5}} {7+15\sqrt{5}}$$ $$\implies ( r-s\sqrt{5})(17+15\sqrt{5})=(m-n\sqrt{5})(7+15\sqrt {5})$$ $$\implies (17r-75s)+\sqrt {5}(15r-17s)=(7m-75n)+\sqrt {5}(15m-7n)$$ Then we have, $$\begin{cases} 15r-17s=15m-7n \\ 17r-75s=7m-75n \end{cases}$$ There are probably good methods for solving such equations in number theory.  But since I don't know, I usually solve such equations by methods I know myself. $$\begin{cases} 255r-289s= 255m-119n \\ 255 r -1125s =105 m - 1125 n \\ 1125r-1275s=1125 m - 525 n \\ 289r-1275s= 119 m - 1275 n \end{cases}$$ $$ \implies \begin{cases} r=\dfrac {503m+375n}{418} \in\mathbb Z \\ s=\dfrac {75m+503n}{418} \in\mathbb Z \end{cases}$$ First restriction $$\begin {align} r=\dfrac {503m+375n}{418} \in\mathbb Z \Longrightarrow r=\dfrac {418m+85m+418n-43n}{418} \Longrightarrow \dfrac{85m-43n}{418}=k_1 \Longrightarrow m=\dfrac{418k_1+43n}{85}=\dfrac{425k_1-7k_1+43n}{85} \Longrightarrow \dfrac {43n-7k_1}{85}=k_2 \Longrightarrow k_1=\dfrac{42n-84k_2+(n-k_2)}{7} \Longrightarrow \dfrac {n-k_2}{7}=k_3 \Longrightarrow n=7k_3+k_2 \end {align} $$ $$\implies k_1=\dfrac{43(7k_3+k_2)-85k_2}{7}=43k_3-6k_2 $$ $$\implies m= \dfrac { 418(43k_3-6k_2)+43(7k_3+k_2)}{85}=215k_3-29k_2$$ $$\implies n=7k_3+k_2$$ $$\implies r=\dfrac {503m+375n}{418} =\dfrac {503(215k_3-29k_2)+375(7k_3+k_2)}{418}=265k_3-34k_2, ~ \text {where} ~ k_2, k_3 \in\mathbb Z.$$ $$\color {gold}{\boxed {\color{black} {r=265k_3-34k_2}}}$$ Second restriction $$\begin{align} s=\dfrac {75m+503n}{418} \in\mathbb Z \Longrightarrow s=\dfrac {75(215k_3-29k_2)+503(7k_3+k_2)}{418}=47k_3-4k_2, ~ \text {where} ~ k_2, k_3 \in\mathbb Z. \end{align}$$ $$\color {gold}{\boxed {\color{black} {s=47k_3-4k_2}}}$$ Thus, no new restrictions are required. Here for simplicity, I am changing $k_2 = v, k_3 = u$ , where $u,v\in\mathbb Z$ . Then we have, $$\color {gold}{\boxed {\color{black} {\begin {align} r=265u-34v\\ s=47u-4v \\m=215u-29v \\n=7u+v \end{align}}}}$$ Now we have to solve any of the equations we obtain. Therefore, solving the first equation will be sufficient: $$r=265u-34v.$$ $$\begin{align} v=\dfrac{265u-r}{34}=8-\dfrac{7u+r}{34}\Longrightarrow \dfrac {7u+r}{34}=k_4 \Longrightarrow u=5k_4-\dfrac{k_4+r}{7} \Longrightarrow k_4+r=7k_5 \Longrightarrow k_4=7k_5-r, ~ \text{where} ~ k_4, k_5 \in\mathbb Z \end{align}$$ $$\implies u=34k_5-5r$$ $$\implies v=\dfrac {265(34k_5-5r)-r}{34}=265k_5-39r$$ For simplicity, I accept $k_5 \longmapsto k$ . So, we have $$\begin{align} u=34k-5r \\ v=265k-39r \end{align}$$ Finally we have, $$\color {gold}{\boxed {\color{black} {\begin{align} \color{blue}{r=r} \\ \color {red}{s=-79 r+538k} \\ \color{green} {m=56 r- 375 k} \\ \color{blueviolet}{n=- 74 r+503k} \end{align}}}}$$ Let's go back to the original problem. If $r=2641$ , then we have $$\begin{align} r=2641 \\ s=-208639+538k \\ m=147896- 375 k \\ n=−195434+503k \end{align}$$ Now we can choose $k$ as we wish. Let, $k=390$ , then we have $$\begin {align} m=1646 \\ n=736 \\ r=2641 \\ s=1181.\end{align}$$ Thus, we obtain the required equality: $$\color {red}{\boxed {\color{black} {\dfrac{1646-736\sqrt{5}} {2641-1181\sqrt{5}} =\dfrac{17+15\sqrt{5}} {7+15\sqrt{5}}}}}$$ And now here we can make the numbers as difficult as we want.  Let's try one example. If $m,n,r,s \in\mathbb {Z^{+}}$ , then we must solve the following system of equations: $$\begin{cases} r>0 \\ -79 r+538k>0 \\ 56 r- 375 k>0 \\- 74 r+503k >0 \end{cases} \Longrightarrow k>0, \dfrac {375k}{56}<r<\dfrac {503k}{74}$$ Let, $k=17639735$ and $r=118123483$ ( a prime number), then we have $$\begin{align} r=118123483 \\ s = 158422273 \\m=14423 \\ n=131648963 \end{align}$$ Finally, our new ""magical"" identity will be as follows: $$\color {gold}{\boxed {\color{blue} {\dfrac{14423-131648963\sqrt{5}} {118123483-158422273\sqrt{5}} \color{red}{=\dfrac{17+15\sqrt{5}} {7+15\sqrt{5}}}}}}$$ Short proof $$\dfrac{1646-736\sqrt{5}} {2641-1181\sqrt{5}} =\dfrac{17+15\sqrt{5}} {7+15\sqrt{5}}$$ $$\Longleftrightarrow \dfrac{445\sqrt 5-995} {1646-736\sqrt{5}} =\dfrac{10} {17+15\sqrt{5}}$$ $$\Longleftrightarrow \dfrac{89\sqrt 5-199} {1646-736\sqrt{5}} =\dfrac{2} {17+15\sqrt{5}}$$ $$ \Longleftrightarrow \dfrac{1845-825\sqrt 5} {1646-736\sqrt{5}} =\dfrac{15+15\sqrt{5}} {17+15\sqrt{5}}$$ $$\Longleftrightarrow \dfrac{123-55\sqrt 5} {1646-736\sqrt{5}} =\dfrac{1+\sqrt 5} {17+15\sqrt{5}}$$ $$\Longleftrightarrow \dfrac  {1646-736\sqrt{5}} {123-55\sqrt 5}=\dfrac  {17+15\sqrt{5}}{1+\sqrt 5}=15+\dfrac{2}{1+\sqrt 5}$$ $$\Longleftrightarrow \dfrac{89\sqrt 5-199} {123-55\sqrt{5}} =\dfrac{2} {1+\sqrt{5}}$$ $$\Longleftrightarrow \dfrac {246-110\sqrt 5}{89\sqrt 5-199} =1+\sqrt 5$$ $$\Longleftrightarrow  \dfrac {246-110\sqrt 5-89\times 5+199 \sqrt 5}{89\sqrt 5-199}=\dfrac {89\sqrt 5-199}{89\sqrt 5-199}=1.$$ Observation We always have the chance to choose at least one of the numbers $m, n, r, s$ as a prime number. According our formulas, we have $$\color {red}{\boxed {\color{black} {\begin{align} r=r \\ s=-79 r+538k \\ m=56 r- 375 k \\ n=- 74 r+503k \end{align}}}}$$ So, we can choose the number $\color{blue}{r}$ always as a prime.
