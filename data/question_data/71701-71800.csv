I started by looking at the sorts of properties which are conserved under homeomorphism and found that such a subset is open and connected.

When there is a counterexample, the base case would be a quotient of the closed disk, with no more than one point on the boundary in each equivalence class.

If this is not true, can a counterexample exist in $\mathbb{R}^2$ ? Some partial results follow. If $X$ is compact, then $d_{A}$ is closed. This follows  since, more generally, continuous maps from compact spaces to Hausdorff spaces are closed. If $X$ has the Heine-Borel property and $A$ is compact then $d_A$ is closed.

Exercise 27.2b of Munkres 2ed states that since $A$ is compact, $d(x, A) = d(x, a)$ for some $a \in A$ . So there exist $a_n \in A$ such that $d(x_n, a_n) \to y$ . Since $A$ is compact there exists a subsequence $a_{i_n}$ of $a_n$ such that $a_{i_n} \to a$ .

Since $B$ is closed, $x \in B$ . Then continuity and the Hausdorff property imply $d_{A}(x) = y$ , implying $y \in d_{A}(B)$ . So the claim follows.

As the standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$ has as a basis the collection of all the open intervals of the form $(a, b)$ , where $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ and $a < b$ , so by virtue of Lemma 16.1 in Munkres the subspace topology on $\mathbb{Q}$ has as a basis the collection of all the intersections $(a, b) \cap \mathbb{Q}$ , where $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ and $a < b$ . Let $q$ be any point of $\mathbb{Q}$ . Let us suppose that $\mathbb{Q}$ is locally compact at $q$ . Then there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $q$ in $\mathbb{Q}$ and a compact subspace $C$ of $\mathbb{Q}$ such that $$ U \subset C. \tag{0} $$ As $U$ is open in $\mathbb{Q}$ , so $$U = V \cap \mathbb{Q} \tag{1} $$ for some open set $V$ in $\mathbb{R}$ . Now as $q \in V$ and as $V$ is open in $\mathbb{R}$ , so there exists an open interval $(a, b)$ on the real line such that $$q \in (a, b) \subset V. \tag{2}$$ Thus we have $$ a < q < b. $$ Let us choose some irrational numbers $c$ and $d$ such that $$ a < c < q < d < b. \tag{3}$$ Then by (2) above we have $$ q  \in  (c, d) \subset (a, b) \subset V,$$ and then by (1) above we also have $$q \, \in \,  (c, d) \cap \mathbb{Q} \,  \subset \, (a, b) \cap \mathbb{Q} \, \subset \,  V \cap \mathbb{Q} \,  = \,  U, $$ that is $$ q \, \in \,  (c, d) \cap \mathbb{Q} \,  \subset \, U, \tag{4}$$ and also $$ (c, d) \cap \mathbb{Q} \ = \  [c, d] \cap \mathbb{Q}, \tag{5} $$ because the endpoints $c$ and $d$ either interval are not in either of the two sets involved. Thus from (0), (4), and (5) above we also have $$q \,  \in \, [c, d] \cap \mathbb{Q} \, \subset \,  C. \tag{6}$$ Now $C$ is a compact subspace of $\mathbb{Q}$ ; moreover $\mathbb{Q}$ , being a metrizable space, is also a Hausdorff space, by the discussion in the third paragraph of Sec. 21 in Munkres. So by Theorem 26.3 in Munkres $C$ , being a compact subspace of the Hausdorff space $\mathbb{Q}$ , is also closed in $\mathbb{Q}$ . Therefore using (6) above we can also conclude that $$ [c, d] \cap \mathbb{Q} = \big( [c, d] \cap \mathbb{Q} \big) \cap C$$ is also closed in $C$ . Thus we have seen that $[c, d] \cap \mathbb{Q}$ is a closed subset of the compact space $C$ . So by Theorem 26.2 in Munkres the subspace $[c, d] \cap \mathbb{Q}$ is also compact (as a subspace of $C$ ); but since $C$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{Q}$ , therefore $[c, d] \cap \mathbb{Q} = (c, d) \cap \mathbb{Q}$ is also a compact subspace of $\mathbb{Q}$ . Therefore every open covering of $[c, d] \cap \mathbb{Q}$ has a finite sub-collection that also covers $[c, d] \cap \mathbb{Q}$ . However, as $c$ and $d$ are irrational numbers [Please refer to (3) above.], so we now show that what has stated in the preceding paragraph is not true. In what follows, the set $\mathbb{N}$ denotes the set of all the positive integers, namely, $1, 2, 3, \ldots$ . Let us consider the collection $$ \left\{ \ \left( c + \frac{d-c}{n+2},\,  d - \frac{d-c}{n+2} \right) \cap \mathbb{Q} \ \colon \  n \in \mathbb{N} \   \right\}. \tag{A} $$ This collection is an open covering of $[c, d]\cap \mathbb{Q}$ such that no finite subcollection of this collection can cover $[c, d] \cap \mathbb{Q}$ ; for if $$ \left\{ \ \left( c + \frac{d-c}{n_1+2}, \,  d - \frac{d-c}{n_1+2} \right) \cap \mathbb{Q},\  \ldots, \ \left( c + \frac{d-c}{ n_r + 2 }, \, d - \frac{d-c}{n_r +2} \right) \cap \mathbb{Q} \ \right\} \tag{B} $$ is any finite sub-collection of the collection in (A) above, where $n_1, \ldots, n_r \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n_1 < \cdots < n_r$ , then \begin{align} & \ \ \ \bigcup_{j=1}^r \left[ \left( c + \frac{d-c}{n_j + 2}, \, d - \frac{d-c}{n_j +2} \right) \ \cap \ \mathbb{Q} \right] \\  &= \left[ \bigcup_{j=1}^r  \left( c + \frac{d-c}{n_j + 2}, d - \frac{d-c}{n_j +2} \right) \right] \ \cap \ \mathbb{Q}  \\  &=  \left( c + \frac{d-c}{n_r + 2}, \,  d - \frac{d-c}{n_r +2} \right) \ \cap \ \mathbb{Q} \\  &\subsetneqq [c, d] \cap \mathbb{Q}.  \end{align} thus showing that $[c, d] \cap \mathbb{Q}$ or $(c, d) \cap \mathbb{Q}$ [Refer to (5) above.] is not compact. Thus we have reached a contradiction. Therefore our supposition that $\mathbb{Q}$ is locally compact at $q$ is wrong. Hence $\mathbb{Q}$ is not locally compact at any point $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ . Is my proof correct in each and every detail? If so, then is my presentation clear enough too? If not, then where are the issues?","Here is Prob. 1, Sec. 29, in the book Topology by James R. Munkres, 2nd edition: Show that the rationals are not locally compact.

As the standard topology on has as a basis the collection of all the open intervals of the form , where and , so by virtue of Lemma 16.1 in Munkres the subspace topology on has as a basis the collection of all the intersections , where and .

I've just come from the fact that a finite product of compact spaces is compact, and I also know from studying bases of topologies that uncountable products aren't necessarily as nice (for example, the box topology has some problems for uncountable products). The proof for Tychonoff's Theorem is: Omitted (this is much harder than anything we have done here). Internet searches lead to math overflow and topics that are very outside of my comfort zone. Is there a proof of Tychonoff's Theorem for an undergrad?",\{X_i : i \in \mathcal{A}\} \displaystyle\prod_{i \in \mathcal{A}}X_i,"['general-topology', 'compactness', 'alternative-proof', 'product-space']"
