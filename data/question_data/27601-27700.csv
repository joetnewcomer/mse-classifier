95,Poles and Zeros of Linear Systems,Poles and Zeros of Linear Systems,,"This period I follow a course in System and Control Theory. This is all about linear systems $$\frac{dx}{dt}= Ax + Bu $$ $$y = Cx + Du $$ where A,B,C,D are matrices, and x, u and y are vectors. To describe my (little) background, I should know things like linearization, Impulse/Step Response, Equillibrium points, (asymptotic) stability (routh, lyapunov), controllability, observability, stabilizability, realization, hankel, etc. Given my background, I would like to ask some questions about poles and zeros of linear systems. If you know the answer of just one of the questions, please dont hesitate to write it down :-) 1.) What are poles and zeros of linear system {A,B,C,D} exactly? What does it mean for a system to have a pole at a certain value, or a zero at certain value? 2.) The author writes about 'poles of a transfer function matrix H(s)'. What is a transfer function matrix? The only thing I know is how to compute it and that it describes some relation between input/output of the system. But why do we need tranfser function matrices? 3.) To calculate the poles and zeros, the author says that we need the Smith and Smith-McMillan Forms. These are matrices that have only diagonal entries. What is exactly the algorithm to calculate the Smith-(McMillan)-form of a transfer matrix? 4.) What is the relation between the poles of a system and the controllability, observability, stability and stabilizability ? The same for a zero ? 5.) What is an invariant zero polynomial of the system {A,B,C,D} ? 6.) What is 'a realization of a system'? 7.) Where can I find more good information about this subject?","This period I follow a course in System and Control Theory.
