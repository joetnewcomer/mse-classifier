0,Hunting for a basis: Rational Canonical Form,Hunting for a basis: Rational Canonical Form,,"I am trying to understand how to find the matrix of transition for the rational canonical form purely using linear algebra (so no $F[x]$ modules). I do realize that Dummit & Foote provide a method for finding the matrix of transition for both RCF and JCF that involves keeping track of the row and column operations done to put our matrix in smith normal form. However, I am trying to do this without that trouble. Here is the particular matrix I'm going to work with: $$ A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 & 0 \\ 9 & 7 & 5 \\ -9 & -5 & -3 \end{bmatrix}$$ With little to no effort, we get that the minimal polynomial of $A$ is $m(x) = (x-2)^2$ so that the largest invariant factor, and hence the largest block has size 2. All in all we know that the corresponding matrix is $$ R = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -4 & 0 \\ 1 & 4 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 2 \end{bmatrix} $$ A basis vector corresponding to the block of size 1 is just an eigenvector, and should be easy enough to find once we have found the other two vectors for the block of size 2. The block of size 2 should have as a basis $\{v, Av\}$. Now I'm not sure where to hunt for the vector $v$. I realize that we need for $Av = Av$ and $A^2 v = 4Av - 4v$.

If M was symmetric, I would now project $x$ on each eigenvector, multiply by $λ_k^n$, and then recombine them. That would give me $y$. But $M$ is not symmetric, Is it any useful that I have the left and right eigenvectors? Would you know how to compute $y$? EDIT (in answer to Florian below): the matrix whose rows are the right eigenvectors of $M$ is too hard to invert, so my question is whether one can to bypass the inversion by using the fact that one knows both sets of eigenvectors?",,"['linear-algebra', 'matrices', 'eigenvalues-eigenvectors', 'determinant', 'inverse']"

99,Proving a matrix rank equality,Proving a matrix rank equality,,In my studies of the Schur complement within matrix theory I have come across this problem which seems tough: Let us consider the block matrix $ A = \left( \begin{array}{ccc} B & C \\ D & E \end{array} \right)  $ where $ E $ is an invertible principal square submatrix of $ A $ and we are asked to prove the following equality of ranks   $\operatorname{rank}\left( \begin{array}{ccc} CE^{-1}D & C \\ D & E \end{array} \right) = \operatorname{rank}(E) $ using the Schur complement I have thought about using the identity $\operatorname{rank}(A)=\operatorname{rank}(E)+\operatorname{rank}(A/E) $ and then using the definition of the Schur complement in this case $ A/E = B-CE^{-1}D $ but I have no idea how to show equality of ranks in this case.
