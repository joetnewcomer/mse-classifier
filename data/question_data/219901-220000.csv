1,Thinking About Fractional Ideals Geometrically,Thinking About Fractional Ideals Geometrically,,"So algebraic geometry gives one a way of thinking about about rings geometrically. Like prime ideals correspond to points in the spectrum of a ring, maximal ideals are closed points and so on. This works well for rings like $\mathbb{C}[x_1,..,x_n]$ and the formalism of an affine scheme extends to other rings such as $\mathbb{Z}$ as well. My question then is how should I think of fractional ideals geometrically? If an ideal of some integral domain $R$ corresponds to some closed set in $\operatorname{Spec}R$ with smaller ideals corresponding to bigger closed sets, then what should a really big fractional ideal like $\frac{1}{p} \mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{Q}$ correspond to? Maybe there is a scheme here that one can define that is bigger than $\operatorname{Spec}Z$ in this case?","So algebraic geometry gives one a way of thinking about about rings geometrically.

The second exercise (3.1 c) asks to show that any conic in $\mathbf{P}^2$ is isomorphic to $\mathbf{P}^1$. Both exercises I've been able to solve whenever the characteristic of the field is different from 2. For the first one I used a brute force calculation where I need to divide by two alot (as morphisms are not really allowed at this point). For the second one I used a symmetric matrix to reduce to the case where the defining polynomial is of the form $F(x,y,z)=ax^2+by^2+cz^2$. This approach also assumes a characteristic different from 2 to construct such a matrix. My question now is how to do this in the case where the characteristic of the base field is 2.

Both exercises are about conics. The first exercise (1.1 c) asks the following: Given an irreducible quadratic polynomial $f$ in $k[x,y]$, show that the affine coordinate ring of $k[x,y]/(f)$ is isomorphic to the coordinate ring of the parabola $y=x^2$ or the hyperbola $xy=1$. The second exercise (3.1 c) asks to show that any conic in $\mathbf{P}^2$ is isomorphic to $\mathbf{P}^1$. Both exercises I've been able to solve whenever the characteristic of the field is different from 2. For the first one I used a brute force calculation where I need to divide by two alot (as morphisms are not really allowed at this point). For the second one I used a symmetric matrix to reduce to the case where the defining polynomial is of the form $F(x,y,z)=ax^2+by^2+cz^2$. This approach also assumes a characteristic different from 2 to construct such a matrix. My question now is how to do this in the case where the characteristic of the base field is 2. I can't seem to find a way to adapt my current methods to this case. Thanks in advance for any answers!",,['algebraic-geometry']

24,About the ramification locus of a morphism with zero dimensional fibers,About the ramification locus of a morphism with zero dimensional fibers,,"This question arises from my somewhat frustrating attempts to understand what etale means (in the world of algebraic varieties for now) and marry the more advanced algebraic geometry references and the ones from differential geometry. The particular example I am studying, is the Lyasko-Looijenga morphism. Say that $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is a finite map of affine varieties with zero-dimensional fibers. Finiteness of the map means that the coordinate ring $A(X)=S$ is a finitely generated $A(Y)=R$ module. Now say the point $y\in Y$ corresponds to the maximal ideal $P\subset R$. I understand how the ideal $PS$ in $S$ cuts the variety $f^{-1}(y)$ but might not be radical, so we define $S/PS$ to be the algebraic fiber but we know it is not exactly the coordinate ring of $f^{-1}(y)$. Evenmore, we know that $S/PS$ is an $R/P$-vector space of dimension $k$ at most as big as the rank of $S$ as an $R$-module (and equal if in particular $S$ is a free $R$-module). This in turn implies that the fiber $f^{-1}(y)$ will contain at most $k$-many points (the coordinate ring of a finite variety is a vector space of dimension as big as its cardinality). I am trying to understand when this number is achieved: The approach in Shafarevich is to consider the extension $f^{*}k(Y)\subset k(X)$ and define $\operatorname{deg}f$ to be its degree; when the cardinality of the fiber equals that degree: $$\#f^{-1}(y)=\operatorname{deg}f$$ we say that $f$ is unramified at $y$. The differential geometry approach is just to check the Jacobian at $y$; $f$ is unramified at $y$ precisely when $$J_f\ (y)\neq 0.$$ Question 1: I am asking for some help to understad the equivalence here.

Therein lies my current conundrum...","This question arises from my somewhat frustrating attempts to understand what etale means (in the world of algebraic varieties for now) and marry the more advanced algebraic geometry references and the ones from differential geometry. The particular example I am studying, is the Lyasko-Looijenga morphism. Say that $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is a finite map of affine varieties with zero-dimensional fibers. Finiteness of the map means that the coordinate ring $A(X)=S$ is a finitely generated $A(Y)=R$ module. Now say the point $y\in Y$ corresponds to the maximal ideal $P\subset R$. I understand how the ideal $PS$ in $S$ cuts the variety $f^{-1}(y)$ but might not be radical, so we define $S/PS$ to be the algebraic fiber but we know it is not exactly the coordinate ring of $f^{-1}(y)$. Evenmore, we know that $S/PS$ is an $R/P$-vector space of dimension $k$ at most as big as the rank of $S$ as an $R$-module (and equal if in particular $S$ is a free $R$-module). This in turn implies that the fiber $f^{-1}(y)$ will contain at most $k$-many points (the coordinate ring of a finite variety is a vector space of dimension as big as its cardinality). I am trying to understand when this number is achieved: The approach in Shafarevich is to consider the extension $f^{*}k(Y)\subset k(X)$ and define $\operatorname{deg}f$ to be its degree; when the cardinality of the fiber equals that degree: $$\#f^{-1}(y)=\operatorname{deg}f$$ we say that $f$ is unramified at $y$. The differential geometry approach is just to check the Jacobian at $y$; $f$ is unramified at $y$ precisely when $$J_f\ (y)\neq 0.$$ Question 1: I am asking for some help to understad the equivalence here. How does the Jacobian of $f$ affect the cardinality of $f^{-1}(y)$ in relation to the degre of the extension $f^{*}k(Y)\subset k(X)$? Question 2: What about the ring $S/PS$? It encodes all the information we need for $f^{-1}(y)$. How can we understand here which points are fatter than others? What is the situation for $\operatorname{Spec}S/PS$?

35,The Plucker relations are sufficient,The Plucker relations are sufficient,,"Consider the Grassmannian of codimension-$d$ subspaces of a given vector space $E$ (over an arbitrary field), which I will define as $$ \operatorname{Gr}^d(E) = \{\text{linear surjections } \sigma: E \to F \mid \text{$F$ is any $d$-dimensional space} \}/\sim$$ where I identify two surjections $(\sigma_1: E \to F_1) \sim (\sigma_2: E \to F_2)$ if there is an isomorphism $m: F_1 \to F_2$ such that $m \sigma_1 = \sigma_2$. Then an isomorphism class of $\sigma$ is determined by the $\ker \sigma$. We also have projective space $\mathbb{P}(E) = \operatorname{Gr}^1(E)$, so that $\operatorname{Sym}^\bullet(E)$ gives homogeneous coordinates on $\mathbb{P}(E)$. The Plucker embedding is the map $\operatorname{Gr}^d(E) \to \mathbb{P}(\bigwedge^d E)$, taking a map $(\sigma: E \to F)$ to its $d$th exterior power $\bigwedge^d \sigma: \bigwedge^d E \to \bigwedge^d F$. Then $\bigwedge^d \sigma$ is a surjection from $\bigwedge^d E$ to a one-dimensional space, and so lives in $\mathbb{P}(\bigwedge^d E)$. So I am thinking of $\bigwedge^d \sigma$ as a point in the embedding of the Grassmannian, and elements of $\bigwedge^d(E)$ give me the linear coordinate functions. For example, if I write out the matrix of $\sigma: E \to F$ in some basis $(e_1, \ldots, e_m)$ for $E$ and any basis for $F$, then $(\bigwedge^d \sigma)(e_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge e_d)$ is proportional to the determinant of minor where we take the first $d$ columns of the matrix for $\sigma$. Of course, the question arises that, given some $(s: \bigwedge^d E \to L) \in \mathbb{P}(\bigwedge^d E)$, is $s$ in the image of the Plucker embedding? (i.e., is $s$ a $d$th wedge power?). The answer to this is given by the Plucker relations, which I will state as follows. Define a linear map $\omega^d_E$ on pure tensors by $$ \begin{aligned}\omega^d_E: \bigwedge^{d+1} E \otimes \bigwedge^{d-1} E &\to \bigwedge^d E \otimes \bigwedge^d E\\ v_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge v_{d+1} \otimes u_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge u_{d-1} &\mapsto \sum_{i = 0}^{d+1} v_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \hat{v_i} \wedge \cdots \wedge v_{d+1} \otimes v_i \wedge u_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge u_{d-1} \end{aligned}$$ Then the point $(s: \bigwedge^d E \to L)$ ""satisfies the Plucker relations"" if the linear map $(s \otimes s) \circ \omega^d_E$ is zero. From this standpoint, it is lovely to see the necessary condition: if $(\sigma: E \to F) \in \operatorname{Gr}^d(E)$, then $\wedge^d \sigma$ must satisfy the Plucker relations, since the wedge power essentially ""pulls through"" the $\omega$: $$ (\wedge^d \sigma \otimes \wedge^d \sigma) \circ \omega^d_E = \omega_F^d \circ (\wedge^{d+1} \sigma \otimes \wedge^{d-1} \sigma)$$ and of course $\wedge^{d+1} \sigma = 0$ because $F$ is $d$-dimensional. However, I am having trouble with the opposite direction. How can I see that if $(s: \wedge^d E \to L) \in \mathbb{P}(\bigwedge^d E)$ satisfies the Plucker relations, then it is (proportional to) the $d$th power of some map $\sigma: E \to F$? I would really like a constructive proof: produce some $\sigma: E \to F$ from $s$, and show that as long as $s$ satisfies the Plucker relations, that $\wedge^d \sigma \sim s$. I can prove similar results for decomposable tensors in $\wedge^d E$, but for some reason with how things are set up, ""dualising"" that proof is eluding me. There is a proof similar to the style I am thinking of on page 175 of Martin Brandenburg's Thesis , unfortunately I cannot follow the proof starting from the ""two short exact sequences"".

I hope that someone can point it out to me. Let $M$ be the algebraic monoid of $n\times n$-matrices and $G$ its unit group, i.e. the subgroup of invertible matrices. Let $X$ be a $G$-variety. Since $G$ is reductive, we can consider the quotient $\pi:X\to\newcommand{\qq}{\mathop{/\hspace{-2.5pt}/}}X\qq G$. It is well-known (see, e.g., Proposition 27.5.3 in the book Lie algebras and algebraic groups by Tauvel and Yu) that for $x\in X$, the fiber $\pi^{-1}(\pi(x))$ contains a unique closed orbit $O$ and $$\pi^{-1}(\pi(x)) = \{ y\in X \mid O\subseteq\overline{G.y} \}.$$ Now let us assume that the action of $G$ extends to an action of $M$ on $X$. For instance, this is the case when $X$ is a $G$-module on which $G$ acts polynomially. It is then easy to see that for any $x\in X,$ we have $G.x\subseteq M.x\subseteq \overline{G.x}$: Let $\alpha_x:M\to X$ be the action morphism $a\mapsto a.x$. Let $U:=\alpha_x^{-1}(G.x)$. We certainly have $G\subseteq U \subseteq M$. As $G$ is open in $M$ and $M$ is irreducible, $\overline{U}=M$. Furthermore, $\alpha_x^{-1}(\overline{G.x})$ is a closed set containing $U$. Thus, we must have $M=\alpha_x^{-1}(\overline{G.x})$. Now for any $x\in X$, we can consider $y:=0.x$, i.e. the image of $x$ under the action of the zero matrix. By the above, we have $y\in\overline{G.x}$. On the other hand, we have $G.y=\{y\}$, so $y$ is a closed $G$-orbit. Now I can think of many examples where $X$ is a linear space and $0.x=0$ for any $x\in X$. In this case, $0$ would be a closed $G$-orbit contained in the orbit closure of any point, so $\pi^{-1}(\pi(0))=X$. In other words, $X\qq G=\{\ast\}$. That is completely absurd. Where is my mistake? Edit. To clarify what I mean by the quotient $X\qq G$, let us assume $X$ to be affine throughout. Then, I define $X\qq G:=\mathrm{Spec}(\Bbbk[X]^G)$ as the spectrum of the ring of $G$-invariants of the coordinate ring of $X$.

For this I would like to construct a map globally and basis-free and then show that it is an isomorphism locally, hence an isomorphism. A typical local generator of $\mathrm{det}(V \otimes W)= \Lambda^{n \times m}(V \otimes W)$ is $$(v_{11} \otimes w_{11}) \wedge \dotsc \wedge (v_{1m} \otimes w_{1m}) \wedge \dotsc \wedge (v_{n1} \otimes w_{n1}) \wedge \dotsc \wedge (v_{nm} \otimes w_{nm}).$$ To which element of $\Lambda^n(V)^{\otimes m}  \otimes \Lambda^m(W)^{\otimes n}$ should we map this? Note that SE/571839 is a very similar question, but I would like to have an abstract proof like indicated in the last paragraph of the accepted answer.  (In fact, I want to prove a similar formula in an arbitrary cocomplete symmetric monoidal $\mathbb{Q}$-linear category, where $V$ is called locally free of rank $n$ if $\Lambda^n V$ is invertible and $\Lambda^{n+1} V = 0$. Here, no local bases are available.)",,"['algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra', 'determinant', 'vector-bundles', 'exterior-algebra']"

64,Hartshorne problem III.5.2(a),Hartshorne problem III.5.2(a),,"Consider problem III.5.2(a) in Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometry : Let $X$ be a projective scheme over a field $k$, let $\mathcal O_X(1)$   be a very ample invertible sheaf on $X$ over $k$, and let $\mathcal F$   be a coherent sheaf on $X$. Show that there is a polynomial $P(z)\in  \mathbb Q[z]$, such that $\chi(\mathcal F(n))=P(n)$ for all   $n\in\mathbb Z$. We call $P$ the Hilbert polynomial of $\mathcal F$   with respect to the sheaf $\mathcal O_X(1)$. [Hints: Use induction on   dim Supp $\mathcal F$, general properties of numerical polynomials (I,   7.3), and suitable exact sequences $$0\rightarrow \mathcal R \rightarrow \mathcal F(-1)\rightarrow  \mathcal F \rightarrow \mathcal L \rightarrow 0.]$$ By III.2.10, we may suppose $X=\mathbb P^n_k$ for some $n$. I think the key difficulty here is describing an injective map $\alpha:\mathcal F(-1)\rightarrow \mathcal F$. For any map between these two sheaves, we get an exact sequence of the kind in the hint by taking the relevant quotient and kernel sheaves. If this map is injective, we get a short exact sequence, and we can use the additivity of the Euler characteristic on short exact sequences to say $$\chi(\mathcal F) - \chi(\mathcal F(-1))=  \chi (\mathcal L).$$ Tensoring with $\mathcal O(n)$ gives $$\chi(\mathcal F(n)) - \chi(\mathcal F(n-1))=  \chi (\mathcal L(n)).$$ So if $\chi(L(n))$ is eventually a polynomial, then $\mathcal F(n)$ is too, by I.7.3(b). If we construct $\alpha$ in such a way that $\mathcal L$ has support at least one dimension less than the support of $\mathcal F$, we're done by induction on the dimension of the support. (We also need to handle dimension $0$ separately, and I omit this discussion because it's not too hard.) So, let me say what I think $\alpha$ should be. Consider a global section $s$ of $O(1)$. Tensoring with $s$ gives a map $\mathcal F(-1)\rightarrow \mathcal F$. In some affine chart, this looks like multiplication by $s$, I think. Now we examine the stalks of the quotient sheaf. The first map, on the level of stalks, is an isomorphism when $s\mathcal F_p=\mathcal F_p$, which happens in particular when $s$ is a unit in the local ring $\mathcal O_{X,p}$, and this happens when $s_p \notin \mathfrak m_p$. Then the support of $\mathcal L$ is contained in the intersection of the support of $\mathcal F$ and $V(s)$, where we consider $s$ as a linear polynomial over $k$. So clearly the dimension of the support goes down by at least one, since hyperplanes have codimension $1$. It seems tricker to choose $s$ so that $\alpha$ is injective. By II.5.15, we know that every (quasi)coherent sheaf on projective space over a field is given as $\tilde M$ for some module $M$ over $k[x_i]$. We need $s$ to not be a zero-divisor. Recall that the set of zero-divisors is exactly the union of the associated primes, and that there are finitely many associated primes. But primes represent subvarieties, and these subvarieties might be impossible to avoid. For example, if a few hyperplanes are among the associate primes, then there’s no way we can choose $\alpha$ to be injective. Is this analysis correct? If so, it seems we need to analyze $\mathcal R$ more carefully and not just suppose it disappears. Could we say something like, its support lies on the union of the associated primes, which are all subvarieties of codimension at least 1, so we are finished by an argument similar to the one indicated above? Explicitly, we would have $$\chi(\mathcal F(n)) - \chi(\mathcal F(n-1))=  \chi (\mathcal L(n)) - \chi (\mathcal R(n)),$$ and then we can induct on dimension and apply I.7.3(b).","Consider problem III.5.2(a) in Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometry : Let $X$ be a projective scheme over a field $k$, let $\mathcal O_X(1)$   be a very ample invertible sheaf on $X$ over $k$, and let $\mathcal F$   be a coherent sheaf on $X$. Show that there is a polynomial $P(z)\in  \mathbb Q[z]$, such that $\chi(\mathcal F(n))=P(n)$ for all   $n\in\mathbb Z$. We call $P$ the Hilbert polynomial of $\mathcal F$   with respect to the sheaf $\mathcal O_X(1)$. [Hints: Use induction on   dim Supp $\mathcal F$, general properties of numerical polynomials (I,   7.3), and suitable exact sequences $$0\rightarrow \mathcal R \rightarrow \mathcal F(-1)\rightarrow  \mathcal F \rightarrow \mathcal L \rightarrow 0.]$$ By III.2.10, we may suppose $X=\mathbb P^n_k$ for some $n$. I think the key difficulty here is describing an injective map $\alpha:\mathcal F(-1)\rightarrow \mathcal F$. For any map between these two sheaves, we get an exact sequence of the kind in the hint by taking the relevant quotient and kernel sheaves. If this map is injective, we get a short exact sequence, and we can use the additivity of the Euler characteristic on short exact sequences to say $$\chi(\mathcal F) - \chi(\mathcal F(-1))=  \chi (\mathcal L).$$ Tensoring with $\mathcal O(n)$ gives $$\chi(\mathcal F(n)) - \chi(\mathcal F(n-1))=  \chi (\mathcal L(n)).$$ So if $\chi(L(n))$ is eventually a polynomial, then $\mathcal F(n)$ is too, by I.7.3(b). If we construct $\alpha$ in such a way that $\mathcal L$ has support at least one dimension less than the support of $\mathcal F$, we're done by induction on the dimension of the support.

67,Glueing of algebraic surface along two intersecting curves,Glueing of algebraic surface along two intersecting curves,,"My question arises as part of understanding an analogue of the normalization of singular curves. Assume that $C$ is such a curve and that $p\in C$ is a singular point of $C$ (and the only one for simplicity). Then the normalization $\widetilde C\to C$ glues two points of $\widetilde C$, or, to rephrase this a little, it glues $\widetilde C$ along two points. (This is what happens to a nodal curve. If $C$ is cuspidal, then a point together with a tangent direction is mapped to a point but let us stick to the nodal case, again for simplicity). Now, let us consider the following: Let $S$ be a surface having a curve singularity along a smooth curve $C$, say a node . Then the normalization of $C$ is a map from a smooth surface $\widetilde S$ to $S$ that maps two curves $C_1,C_2\cong C, C_1\cap C_2=\emptyset$ in $S$ to the curve $C$.

As just indicated, if the curves $C_1,C_2$ on $\widetilde S$ intersect, then I expect the curve $C$ which is the singular locus of $S$, to be singular as well. Also the condition $C_1,C_2\cong C$ should become $C_1,C_2\cong \widetilde C$ in this case so that we still have smooth curves in $\widetilde S$. ($\widetilde C$ denotes the normalization of $C$.) My question now is the following: 0) Following the suggestion by @Get Off The Internet, given a smooth surface $S'$ and a smooth curve $C'$ together with a $2-1$ map from $C'$ to another curve $C$, which may have singularities, does there exist a surface S having singularities along C, whose normalization is the original surface $S'$? 1) Can we say anything about the singularity of $S$ at the image of the intersection point $C_1\cap C_2\in \widetilde S$? If not, how about the singularity of $C$ in this point? 2) The normalization $\widetilde S\to S$ provides a desingularization of $S$ and it is minimal due to the universal property of the normalization. If we embedded $S\hookrightarrow V$ where $V$ is a smooth variety, then we can blow-up $V$ several times and end up with $\widetilde S\hookrightarrow \widetilde V$ where $\widetilde V$ denotes the blown-up $V$. It is clear that over $C_1,C_2$ there lies a $\mathbb P^1$-bundle that is contracted. Just think of the case of a nodal curve $C$. However, this is much less clear over the point of intersection of $C_1,C_2$. I expect that over this point the $\mathbb P^1$-bundles just intersect and nothing bad happens but I can't see any formal reason for that.

The fibres of $S\to C$ are then nodal curves degenerating to a cuspidal one (=the fibre over $p$). However, I'm really uncertain about singularities of $S$ and how its singular locus looks like. My impression is that I have nodes along $C\setminus\{p\}$ and that the singular locus is a cuspidal curve whose normalization is $C$.
