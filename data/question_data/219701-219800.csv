0,Weighted projective space and $\mathrm{Proj}$,Weighted projective space and,\mathrm{Proj},"I'm trying to solve a problem from Jenia Tevelev's notes on GIT. (Problem 5 at the end of this pdf .) Compute $$\operatorname{Proj}\frac{\mathbb{C}[x,y,z]}{(x^5+y^3+z^2)}$$ where $\operatorname{wt.}x,y,z=12,20,30$. Here is what I have so far. Let $R=\mathbb{C}[x,y,z]$ with the above weighting, so we have the natural graded ring structure given by the weighted degree: $R=\bigoplus_{n\geqslant0}R_n$. Then $R\cong R^{(2)}\cong R^{(4)}\cong R^{(20)}\cong R^{(60)}$, where $$R^{(k)}=\bigoplus_{n\geqslant0}R_{kn}.$$ Under these transformation, the ideal given by the polynomial in the question transforms as $$(x^5+y^3+z^2)\mapsto (x^5+y^3+z^2)\mapsto (x^5+y^3+z)\mapsto (x+y^3+z)\mapsto (x+y+z).$$ So, with $S=\frac{\mathbb{C}[x,y,z]}{(x^5+y^3+z^2)}$ we have that $$S^{(60)} = \left(\frac{\mathbb{C}[x,y,z]}{(x^5+y^3+z^2)}\right)^{(60)} = \frac{\mathbb{C}[x,y,z]^{(60)}}{(x+y+z)} = \frac{\mathbb{C}[x^5,y^3,z^2]}{(x+y+z)}.$$ Questions: Is all of the above right? In particular, is it true that $$\left(\frac{\mathbb{C}[x,y,z]}{(x^5+y^3+z^2)}\right)^{(60)} \neq \frac{\mathbb{C}[x,y,z]^{(60)}}{(x^5+y^3+z^2)}.$$ That is, we can't just 'carry through' the truncation, we have to see how the ideal changes as well. How can I proceed from here? Edit: It seems that the rather useful fact that I missed is that $$\operatorname{Proj}\frac{k[x_0,\ldots,x_n]}{I}\cong\mathbb{V}(I)\subset\mathbb{P}(a_0,\ldots,a_n)$$   where $\operatorname{wt.}x_i=a_i$. Then the problem boils down to understanding $$\frac{\mathbb{V}_{\mathrm{aff}}(x^5+y^3+z^2)\setminus\{0\}}{\mathbb{G}_m}$$ where $\mathbb{G}_m$ acts on $\mathbb{A}^3$ via the standard way for weighted projective space. But I'm not sure if this is true when the generators are of different degrees, in which case we do need to look at the truncation first. (If this is not the case then I'd be super interested to know how both methods proceed - via the truncation and just jumping straight in.) Then it looks like it might make sense to guess that $$\operatorname{Proj}\frac{\mathbb{C}[x^5,y^3,z^2]}{(x+y+z)} = \mathbb{V}(x+y+z)\subset\mathbb{P}(60,60,60)$$ but the issue is that $(x+y+z)$ is not homogeneous, and our ideal is given in terms of elements that we can't make from our generators.","I'm trying to solve a problem from Jenia Tevelev's notes on GIT.

The usual motivation for the Zariski topology on affine space $\mathbb{A}^n(k)$ is that it is the coarsest topology for which the algebraic sets, the zero loci of polynomials, are closed.

Call this topology $\tau,$ so $\tau =\{\varnothing,k^\times,k\}.$ There are other topologies $k$ could carry for which the Zariski topology is the initial topology for regular maps in to $k$ , including for example the Zariski topology on $\mathbb{A}^1\cong k.$ But for the purposes of parsimony, and for non-circularity in motivating the definition of the Zariski topology, I prefer to use $\tau$ , which is the coarsest topology on $k$ with this property. Does this topological space $(k,\tau)$ occur in the literature, or have a name? Is there a natural or intrinsic algebraic justification for this topology (whatever that might mean)? It seems like an algebraic analogue of Sierpiński space , in that it classifies open sets in the regular category. The only intrinsic topology that I know for an arbitrary ring is the $I$ -adic topology. But the only ideal of a field is the zero ideal, and the $I$ -adic topology for the zero ideal gives the discrete topology. So $\tau$ is not the $I$ -adic topology. I do not see any way to view $\tau$ as the Zariski topology on $k$ , which, if it existed, should be the zero loci of the constant polynomials, hence the trivial topology. Actually that's not correct, that's not the Zariski topology on $k$ , the Zariski topology is properly assigned to $\mathbb{A}^0=\text{pt}$ , not to $k$ , which is instead its coordinate ring. Anyway, $\tau$ is not the trivial topology. We might identify $k$ with $\mathbb{A}^1,$ but the Zariski topology on $\mathbb{A}^1$ is usually the cofinite topology, which has $\lvert k\rvert$ many closed points, whereas $(k,\tau)$ has only one. So $\tau$ is not the Zariski topology either. I'm hoping to provide an intrinsic motivation for this topology $\tau$ on $k$ , to use in turn to motivate the definition of the Zariski topology from earlier principles, so even if we could view it as the Zariski (which, again, I don't see how we can), I'm hoping to hear a different justification.","Let be a field.

Actually that's not correct, that's not the Zariski topology on , the Zariski topology is properly assigned to , not to , which is instead its coordinate ring. Anyway, is not the trivial topology. We might identify with but the Zariski topology on is usually the cofinite topology, which has many closed points, whereas has only one. So is not the Zariski topology either. I'm hoping to provide an intrinsic motivation for this topology on , to use in turn to motivate the definition of the Zariski topology from earlier principles, so even if we could view it as the Zariski (which, again, I don't see how we can), I'm hoping to hear a different justification.","k \mathbb{A}^n(k) \mathbb{A}^n k k 0 \tau, \tau =\{\varnothing,k^\times,k\}. k k \mathbb{A}^1\cong k. \tau k (k,\tau) I I \tau I \tau k k \mathbb{A}^0=\text{pt} k \tau k \mathbb{A}^1, \mathbb{A}^1 \lvert k\rvert (k,\tau) \tau \tau k","['algebraic-geometry', 'ring-theory', 'commutative-algebra', 'field-theory', 'zariski-topology']"

86,Maximal ideals in polynomial rings over a field,Maximal ideals in polynomial rings over a field,,"Let $K$ be an algebraically closed field and let $k$ be a subfield of $K$ such that the field extension $K \mid k$ is algebraic. Let $B$ be the polynomial ring $K [x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ and let $A$ be the subring $k [x_1, \ldots, x_n]$. It is clear that any $k$-subalgebra of $K$ is a field, so it follows that the intersection of $A$ and any maximal ideal of $B$ is a maximal ideal of $A$. Moreover, every maximal ideal of $A$ arises in this way. Question. What are the maximal ideals of $A$, described in terms of the maximal ideals of $B$? It is well-known that the maximal ideals of $B$ are all of the form $(x_1 - a_1, \ldots, x_n - a_n)$ for some $n$-tuple $(a_1, \ldots, a_n)$ of elements of $K$. Thus, for each maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ of $A$, we may define the set $$P(\mathfrak{m}) = \{ (a_1, \ldots, a_n) \in K^n : (x_1 - a_1, \ldots, x_n - a_n) \cap A = \mathfrak{m} \}$$ and this set is finite (because it is a 0-dimensional closed subset of $\mathbb{A}^n_K$). Consider $G = \mathrm{Aut}(K \mid k)$. Of course, $G$ acts on $B$, and every element of $A$ is invariant under the action of $G$, so it follows that $P (\mathfrak{m})$ is closed under the action of $G$ in $K^n$ as well, i.e. $P (\mathfrak{m})$ is the union of $G$-orbits. Conjecture. $G$ acts transitively on $P (\mathfrak{m})$. This is certainly true if $k$ is a perfect field and $n = 1$ – after all, in that case, $\mathfrak{m}$ is a principal ideal generated by a polynomial in one variable irreducible over $k$. In fact this is true even without the assumption that $k$ is perfect: we know that the residue field $\kappa (\mathfrak{m}) = A / \mathfrak{m}$ is a finite field extension of $k$ and that the right $G$-set of $k$-algebra embeddings $\kappa (\mathfrak{m}) \to K$ is isomorphic to the right $G$-set of zeros in $K$ for the generator of $\mathfrak{m}$; but the homomorphism extension property of $\kappa (\mathfrak{m}) \to K$ implies that any two embeddings can be connected by an isomorphism of $K$, so $G$ acts transitively on the set of $k$-algebra embeddings $\kappa (\mathfrak{m}) \to K$. What about the general case where $n > 1$? I had always taken for granted that the indicated conjecture was true, but I have not been able to find a proof in the usual places. By descent theory, one can show that $$\operatorname{Spec} B \otimes_k B \rightrightarrows \operatorname{Spec} B \to \operatorname{Spec} A$$ is a coequaliser diagram in the category of schemes, so $\operatorname{Spec} A$ is a scheme-theoretic quotient of $\operatorname{Spec} B$ by an internal equivalence relation, but it is not clear to me what this internal equivalence relation is when $n > 0$.

If $S$ is a K3 surface and $C$ is a smooth not hyperelliptic curve of genus g, then we have a birational morphism $\phi : S\rightarrow\mathbb{P}^g$, whose restriction to $C$ is the canonical morphism $C\rightarrow\mathbb{P}^{g-1}$. Since $S$ is minimal, it is isomorphic to the surface $\phi(S)$. The hyperplane sections of $\phi(S)$ are the curves $H=\phi( C^\prime)$, with $C^\prime\in|C|$. $H^2=C^2=2g-2$. We have the exact sequence  $$0 \rightarrow I \rightarrow \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P^g}}\rightarrow\mathcal{O}_{\phi(S)}\rightarrow 0,$$ where $I$ is the ideal sheaf of $\phi(S)\subset\mathbb{P}^g$. From this we obtain also the exact sequence $$0\rightarrow I(k)\rightarrow\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^g}(k)\rightarrow\mathcal{O}_{\phi(S)}(k)\rightarrow 0,$$ where $I(k)$ is the sheaf of polynomials of degree $k$ that vanish on $\phi(S)$. Using the cohomology sequence we have $$h^0(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^g}(k))\leq h^0(I(k))+h^0(\mathcal{O}_{\phi(S)}(k)).$$ If $g=4$, $\phi(S)$ has degree $6$ and we have $$h^0(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^4}(2))=15\,\,\,and\,\,\,h^0(\mathcal{O}_{\phi(S)}(2H))=14,$$ so $\phi(S)$ is contained in a quadric of $\mathbb{P}^4$. Repeating the same argument with $k=3$, we obtain that $\phi(S)$ is contained also in a cubic. Beauville then claims that $\phi(S)$ is a complete intersection surface $S_{2,3}\subset\mathbb{P}^4$. And i agree since they both have the same degree and $S_{2,3}$ is a K3 surface, but i think that maybe this is not enough as we see in the next example. He repeats the same argument with $g=5$ and he finds out that $\phi(S)$ it is contained in 3 quadrics that are linear independent in $\mathbb{P}^5$. This time he can't conclude that $\phi(S)$ is a complete intersection $S_{2,2,2}\subset\mathbb{P}^5$. Infact in this case, if $C$ admits a $g^1_3$ (i.e. an invertible sheaf $L$ of degree 3 such that $h^0(C,L)=2$), then $\phi(S)$ is not a complete intersection $S_{2,2,2}$ (exercise 11 of the same section of the book). But i see no difference with the $g=4$ case, infact $S_{2,2,2}$ is a K3 surface of degree $8$, like $\phi(S)$. I don't understand why in the case $g=4$ he can conclude all at once that $\phi(S)$ is a complete intersection $S_{2,3}$, since in the second case he can't.","I'm following Beauville's book ""Complex Algebraic Surfaces"". If $S$ is a K3 surface and $C$ is a smooth not hyperelliptic curve of genus g, then we have a birational morphism $\phi : S\rightarrow\mathbb{P}^g$, whose restriction to $C$ is the canonical morphism $C\rightarrow\mathbb{P}^{g-1}$. Since $S$ is minimal, it is isomorphic to the surface $\phi(S)$. The hyperplane sections of $\phi(S)$ are the curves $H=\phi( C^\prime)$, with $C^\prime\in|C|$. $H^2=C^2=2g-2$. We have the exact sequence  $$0 \rightarrow I \rightarrow \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P^g}}\rightarrow\mathcal{O}_{\phi(S)}\rightarrow 0,$$ where $I$ is the ideal sheaf of $\phi(S)\subset\mathbb{P}^g$. From this we obtain also the exact sequence $$0\rightarrow I(k)\rightarrow\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^g}(k)\rightarrow\mathcal{O}_{\phi(S)}(k)\rightarrow 0,$$ where $I(k)$ is the sheaf of polynomials of degree $k$ that vanish on $\phi(S)$. Using the cohomology sequence we have $$h^0(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^g}(k))\leq h^0(I(k))+h^0(\mathcal{O}_{\phi(S)}(k)).$$ If $g=4$, $\phi(S)$ has degree $6$ and we have $$h^0(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^4}(2))=15\,\,\,and\,\,\,h^0(\mathcal{O}_{\phi(S)}(2H))=14,$$ so $\phi(S)$ is contained in a quadric of $\mathbb{P}^4$. Repeating the same argument with $k=3$, we obtain that $\phi(S)$ is contained also in a cubic. Beauville then claims that $\phi(S)$ is a complete intersection surface $S_{2,3}\subset\mathbb{P}^4$. And i agree since they both have the same degree and $S_{2,3}$ is a K3 surface, but i think that maybe this is not enough as we see in the next example. He repeats the same argument with $g=5$ and he finds out that $\phi(S)$ it is contained in 3 quadrics that are linear independent in $\mathbb{P}^5$. This time he can't conclude that $\phi(S)$ is a complete intersection $S_{2,2,2}\subset\mathbb{P}^5$. Infact in this case, if $C$ admits a $g^1_3$ (i.e. an invertible sheaf $L$ of degree 3 such that $h^0(C,L)=2$), then $\phi(S)$ is not a complete intersection $S_{2,2,2}$ (exercise 11 of the same section of the book). But i see no difference with the $g=4$ case, infact $S_{2,2,2}$ is a K3 surface of degree $8$, like $\phi(S)$. I don't understand why in the case $g=4$ he can conclude all at once that $\phi(S)$ is a complete intersection $S_{2,3}$, since in the second case he can't.",,"['algebraic-geometry', 'k3-surfaces']"

Then what is the usual way (if any) to define the flop $f^+: Y^+ \to X$ ? I could find a clear and uniform way to define flips in the literature, however, for flops things become very confusing. In the paper ""Flops"" by Kollár, it defines (Def 2.1) the $D$-flop of $f$, which is the small map $f^+ : Y^+ \to X$ such that $D^+$ (the proper transform of $D$) is $f^+$-ample (there are some other assumptions in the definition which I omit). However, something must be missing in that definition, because by that definition, $f$ itself is the flop of $f$. Moreover, this is the definition of $D$-flop, then what is the definition of flop? Is it the case $D = K_Y$? In Debarre's ""Higher-Dimensional Algebraic Geometry"" (see footnote in page 173), the flop is ""defined"" by a small map which ""removes the curve on which the canonical divisor has degree 0 and replaces it with another curve with the same property.
