Frajese explains how Euclid, not feeling confident about his own parallel postulate, tried to delay its usage as much as he could, wanting to see how far he could push geometry forward before he was forced to make use of it. In particular, he focuses on the very existence of proposition $\text{I}, 17$ , which states that the sum of any two angles within any triangle is always less than $180^°$ (in modern notation, of course). This proposition is apparently useless and redundant, seeing how it's just a consequence of $\text{I}, 32$ —the much more well-known theorem according to which the sum of the internal angles of a triangle is precisely $180^°$ . This apparent redundancy is easily explained by Frajese as he points out that between these two theorems is $\text{I},29$ , the first proposition that Euclid cannot prove without his postulate parallel. Therefore, $\text{I}, 17$ exists as a separate proposition simply because Euclid wanted to write down as many results as he could that didn't depend on that postulate, even if they're mere corollaries of results he will later prove in a more general way. But then, this leads me to a question. If $\text{I}, 17$ is indeed independent from the parallel postulate, how can elliptic geometry be consistent? The independence of the fifth postulate from the other ones is usually shown by exhibiting geometries like this, which make use of the first four postulates while replacing the fifth one with something else, and then pointing out that the resulting system is still consistent. But in elliptic geometry a triangle will look like this thing here—see image below; and surely the angles in this triangle add up to more than $180^°$ (indeed, it's one of the most peculiar traits of elliptic geometry that everyone knows).

Then the blue rod as a complex number is $$a(z^3-z^6)+b+z+z^2+z^3+cz^4$$ where $z=e^{2i\pi/9}$ , and its squared length is in $\mathbb Q(z)$ : $$3a^2+b^2+c^2+3a-b-c+3+(1+2ac)z-(1+2ac)z^2+(-1-3a-b-c+ac+bc)z^4+(-2-3a-b-c-ac+bc)z^5$$ Since $\{1,z,z^2,z^3,z^4,z^5\}$ is a $\mathbb Q$ -basis for $\mathbb Q(z)$ yet the expression has to be a rational square, the coefficients of $z$ to $z^5$ must be zero, leading to $b$ and $c$ expressed in terms of $a$ : $$b=\frac{1-3a-6a^2}{1+2a}\qquad c=-\frac1{2a}$$ Substituting gives the blue rod length as $$\frac{\sqrt{1+6a+24a^2+48a^3+144a^4+288a^5+192a^6}}{2a(1+2a)}$$ so all rational bracings under this framework correspond to rational points on the hyperelliptic curve $y^2=1+6a+24a^2+48a^3+144a^4+288a^5+192a^6$ . Using PARI/GP I have found four pairs of rational points on the curve with $a=-\frac12,0,\frac14,\frac32$ .

How do I determine the diameter of each of the six smaller spheres please? I say how but in all honesty I probably wouldn't understand any process offered...personally, with little knowledge of math, I just assume there to be some constant appertaining to the diameter of the original sphere and the diameter of the smaller? Eg: Six regular 40mm ping-pong balls require a Vesica/Saucer formed from a sphere of diameter 40 x some Constant? Thanks/Gill",,['geometry']

There are a few ways to think about this, however I'll give it exactly as in the original applied problem I'm trying to solve. Consider a network of $n$ coplanar nodes in $2$ -dimensions, with known coordinates, and a signal with velocity $v$ , with arbitrary coordinates $(x,y)$ and emitted at an unknown time $t$ .

The Problem: Given the time at which the signal reached each node (or, if you like, all $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ time of arrival differences), how can we determine whether it may correspond to a source coplanar with the nodes (a source in $2$ -dimensions). Or, if you like, how can we flag input as ""invalid"" before passing it to the algorithm?

I also know that the maximum possible time of arrival difference will be for the two furthest nodes (the ""diameter"" of the set, if you like, or the diameter of the minimum bounding sphere). Will restricting input to lying between this minimum and maximum be sufficient enough to exclude input that corresponds to sources outside of the plane formed by the nodes?

There are occasions when I understand what he is doing, but not always. I believe he is always using the same reasoning for each and everyone of these situations, so I am disappointed by the fact that I can understand what he is doing in some cases but not in all cases. I would like to understand if there is some general pattern of reasoning that the author is following in each one of the cases, which I fail to see. I will give two examples: First example Fact: Any open subscheme of a noetherian scheme is noetherian; and for any generic open of a noetherian scheme, its ring of sections is a noetherian ring. Sketch of proof by reduction to the affine case: Step1: A generic open of an affine noetherian scheme is noetherian. Step2: Given a finite covering of affines, the intersections with the generic open $U$ is a finite cover of $U$ by opens which are noetherian by step1, so we conclude. For the second part of the statement, since we saw that $U$ must be noetherian we cover it with a finite number of noetherian affines $U_j$ , $j=1,...,n$ . Given an ideal $I \subseteq \mathcal{O}_X(U)$ , its extension $I_j=I\mathcal{O}_X(U_j)$ is finitely generated for any $j$ . Pulling back the generators of $I_j$ for each $j$ , we get a finite subset in $\mathcal{O}_X(U)$ and we consider the ideal $J$ generated by it. We have then $I_j=I\mathcal{O}_X(U_j)=J\mathcal{O}_X(U_j)$ for every $j$ . Next, passing to the stalks we get that $I\mathcal{O}_{U_j,x}=J\mathcal{O}_{U_j,x}$ for every point $x \in U$ , and we conclude $I=J$ by a Nakayama argument. Done. Second example: Fact: Let $X$ be an integral scheme with generic point $\xi$ , $U$ a generic open subscheme, and recall that we can view both $\mathcal{O}_X(U)$ and $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ as subrings of $\mathcal{O}_{X,\xi}$ . We have that $\cap_{x\in U}\mathcal{O}_{X,x}=\mathcal{O}_X(U)$ . In the proof, Q.Liu's just says ""by covering $U$ with affine opens, we may assume $U$ is affine"". I see that here there is a (partial) explanation of this second example. But the answer there is actually not very illuminating for the purpose of my main question above. It does seem that the reduction to the affine case is a general strategy of proof that is realized with some random trick which is different for every situation.

For sector angles larger than $\pi$, i.e for $\pi \lt \alpha \lt 2\pi$, this remains the largest rectangle, as no rectangle can bend around or encompass the circle's center (see figure below).

The former represents almost perfectly retracing the first side along a very short arc that is almost a straight line; the latter represents going around the circle in what is almost a regular inscribed polygon. EDIT The nearly straight line case does not happen; see the edit  above. I'm also almost sure that for small positive $\epsilon$,  $A(r)$ has a positive second derivative at $r=\frac12 + \epsilon$, and a  negative second derivative at $r = 1-\epsilon$, and that $A(r)$ has just one point of inflection. My question, then, is to find $A(r)$, or failing that, to describe some non-trivial properties of $A(r)$.",,"['geometry', 'limits', 'trigonometry']"

40,Stellating the Octahedron,Stellating the Octahedron,,"I have a few related questions and I'd be happy to get some help with any one of them. Is the stellation of a polyhedron generally a 'messy' affair that involves trimming away portions of the enlarged faces? (See below for my implicit assumption, $\text{stellation} \cong \text{dilation},$ that is probably wrong, I see now) Are there any polyhedral stellations that come from simply dilating the faces , no trimming necessary? Is there a good reference that explicitly defines stellation? I use truncation often but have gotten by with intuition, but this is not the case with stellation. Context: I am trying to create a very primitive animation/demonstration that shows the stellation of an octahedron to yield the stella octangula. Unfortunately, it seems that the mental image I have for stellation isn't living up to the real thing. I've always thought that one simply dilates each face, since this is what happens to the star polygons. Quoting Coxeter ( Regular Polytopes , section 6.2 on Polyhedra Stellation), it appears this is not necessarily the case: In order to stellate a Polyhedron, we have to extend its faces symmetrically until they again form a polyhedron. At any rate, I started with the stately octahedron, shown here using the software Grapher for OSX (I prefer the faces colored uniformly, but it defaults to checkerboard every time I scale). Now I start to scale each face about its center; this image shows each face scaled by a factor of $2$ . I'm noticing the triangular 'hole' starting to close up in the NorthEast region, for example. Here it is scaled by a factor of $4$ , where the three planes bounding the previous triangular 'hole' have finally met at a point. And here's a closeup near the three planes meeting at that point, with the 'hole' finally closed. In the last image I think I can see the stella octangula hiding underneath, but the there are many portions of the enlarged faces that need to be thrown away. I only have hands-on experience stellating regular polygons, by extending the edges, to produce star polygons . In that case, it's just a matter of finding the right scale factors for the edges with no trimming required. My goal was for an expository lecture to non math-majors, but that animation is shaping up to be far too complicated.","I have a few related questions and I'd be happy to get some help with any one of them.

48,"Volume of a sphere ""corner""","Volume of a sphere ""corner""",,"I would like to find the formula of the volume of the ""corner"" of a sphere of radius R, more specifically the volume delimited in a sphere by the intersection of two perpendicular planes, one parallel to the (Oxz) plane at a distance from it, and the other parallel to the (Oxy) plane also at a distance D from it. This might not be extremely clear without a drawing, so I will explain where this problem originates from: Consider a cube with edge $2D$, and a sphere of radius $R$ with the center of the sphere at the center of the cube. The sphere grows (e.g. with time) and we would like to determine the volume of the sphere lying inside the cube. At first, the sphere is totally inside the cube, so the answer is easy and that volume is $$V = \frac{4}{3} \pi \times R^3$$ This formula holds up to the point where the sphere is inscribed in the cube, ie $R = D$. Then, the sphere keeps growing. We thus need to remove from the formula above the volume of each spherical cap above each face to obtain the formula of the sphere volume inside the cube: $$V = \frac{4}{3}\pi \times R^3 - 6 \times V_\text{cap} $$ with $$ V_\text{cap} = \frac{\pi h^2}{3} \times (3R - h) $$ where $ h = R-D $ is the height of the spherical cap. This formula holds until the spherical caps start overflowing over the edges and intersect with the spherical cap from the adjacent face (at $ R = D \sqrt 2$ ). for $ R > D \sqrt 2$, the formula above actually removes twice the volume of the intersection of each pair of spherical caps (one pair per edge), while we only need to remove it once. Hence the actual formula is: $$ V = V = \frac{4}{3} \pi \times R^3 - 6 \times V_\text{cap} + 12 \times V_\text{cap-intersection} $$ Now the tricky part (where I need help) is to actually find the formula for the volume of the intersections of each pair of spherical caps. If you draw it, it actually looks like the corner of a sphere (the space stuck between the two perpendicular planes intersecting and the edge of the sphere). I was not able to compute correctly that volume using integral calculus (probably due to some mistakes in the long and tedious calculus), hence my question. Any help or lead to solve this problem would be greatly appreciated.","I would like to find the formula of the volume of the ""corner"" of a sphere of radius R, more specifically the volume delimited in a sphere by the intersection of two perpendicular planes, one parallel to the (Oxz) plane at a distance from it, and the other parallel to the (Oxy) plane also at a distance D from it. This might not be extremely clear without a drawing, so I will explain where this problem originates from: Consider a cube with edge $2D$, and a sphere of radius $R$ with the center of the sphere at the center of the cube. The sphere grows (e.g. with time) and we would like to determine the volume of the sphere lying inside the cube. At first, the sphere is totally inside the cube, so the answer is easy and that volume is $$V = \frac{4}{3} \pi \times R^3$$ This formula holds up to the point where the sphere is inscribed in the cube, ie $R = D$. Then, the sphere keeps growing. We thus need to remove from the formula above the volume of each spherical cap above each face to obtain the formula of the sphere volume inside the cube: $$V = \frac{4}{3}\pi \times R^3 - 6 \times V_\text{cap} $$ with $$ V_\text{cap} = \frac{\pi h^2}{3} \times (3R - h) $$ where $ h = R-D $ is the height of the spherical cap.

I want to show that there is one point contained in the interior of at least two of the given triangles. Here are my thoughts: If two of the triangles are the same then we're done, so suppose without loss of generality that $C$ and $D$ are different. Think of the triangles as simplices. By definition, this means that the sets $\{c - a, b - a\}$, $\{d - a, b - a\}$, and $\{e - a, b - a\}$ are linearly independent. Since $C$ and $D$ are different, this must mean that $\{c - a, d - a\}$ is also linearly independent, hence it is a basis of $\mathbb R^2$.

Let $c, a, b$ be the vertices of $C$, let $d, a, b$ be the vertices of $D$, and let $e, a, b$ be the vertices of $E$. I want to show that there is one point contained in the interior of at least two of the given triangles. Here are my thoughts: If two of the triangles are the same then we're done, so suppose without loss of generality that $C$ and $D$ are different. Think of the triangles as simplices. By definition, this means that the sets $\{c - a, b - a\}$, $\{d - a, b - a\}$, and $\{e - a, b - a\}$ are linearly independent. Since $C$ and $D$ are different, this must mean that $\{c - a, d - a\}$ is also linearly independent, hence it is a basis of $\mathbb R^2$.

The reason for this is to extend the well known result that 1D linear/harmonic oscillators are equivalent to uniform circular motions in the 2D plane, projected onto a line. Generalizing this, it is possible to think of n -dimensional harmonic oscillators as projections of the sum of uniform motions on n circles in n orthogonal planes in an ( n +1)-dimensional Euclidean space with a common vertical axis. To illustrate this construction in the n =2 case, I have created an animated GIF showing two unit circles centered at the origin in the x-z and y-z planes: In this animation, the view rotates to show the same trajectory from two different viewpoints. The second view visually shows the linear projection onto the gray plane. Purple square shows the sum of the projections of the red and blue balls onto this ( x-y ) plane. (There is a random phase shift between the red and blue balls.) More images and animations of this type are posted on my Twitter feed . The alignment of the gray ball and the purple square in the projection view visually indicates that 2D linear oscillator motions (purple square) are indistinguishable from projected motions on the 3D surface (gray ball).

I've found a few sources that calculate this functional explicitly, and they end up with the following expression: $$ T[f] = \int_{x_1}^{x_2} \sqrt{\frac{1+(f'(x))^2}{2gf(x)}} dx $$ where $g$ is the gravitational constant. This is usually derived by first expressing the time as: $$ T[f] = \int \frac{ds}{v} $$ However, I don't really understand how this expression is obtained, and using the arc length formula $ ds = \sqrt{dx^2 + dy^2} $ doesn't feel very rigorous at all. I'd prefer have a rigorous way of getting the functional. In a more general sense, I'm asking: if we know the acceleration of the ball at any single point, how can we tell how long it takes to go from one point to another?","I'm trying to look at the Brachistochrone problem as an example of calculus of variations. In this problem we have two points in 2D space, where the second is below and to the right of the first, and we have to draw a curve between the two points such that the time it takes a ball to roll down the curve is minimized. From a calculus of variations viewpoint, we want to find a function $f:[x_1, x_2] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ with given boundary conditions $f(x_1) = y_1, f(x_2) = y_2$ that minimizes a functional $T[f]$ that represents the time it takes for the ball to roll down the curve. I'm stuck trying to figure out what exactly this functional should be.

But I already know how to see a 4D shape in 3D space. However, I was reading through this Wikipedia page and, being Wikipedia, it was written using language beyond my scope. So could someone please explain how to see a 5D equivalent of a cube?","So I recently saw Visualizing the 4th dimension. and thought it was a very good question.
