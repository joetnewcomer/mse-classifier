We are trying to show that the two functors $\sf Id:FDVec_k\to FDVec_k$ and $(\cdot)^{\vee\vee}:\sf FDVec_k\to FDVec_k$ are naturally isomorphic. I've never seen such an argument before, and working through the linear algebra is giving me some problems. An element of $V^{\vee\vee}$ is defined to be a linear map from $V^{\vee}$ to $k$, so it takes linear maps $V\to k$ to elements of $k$. For a natural isomorphism we need isomorphisms $$m_V:V\to V^{\vee\vee}.$$ We input a vector and output a map $\operatorname{Hom}(V,k)\to k$: $$m_V(v)(f:V\to k)=f(v)\in k.$$ We then need to show that diagrams $$ \begin{CD} V @>\phi>> W\\ @V{m_V}VV @VV{m_W}V\\ V^{\vee\vee} @>>\phi^{\vee\vee}> W^{\vee\vee} \end{CD} $$ commute if $\phi$ is a linear map of finite-dimensional vector spaces, so $$m_W\circ\phi=\phi^{\vee\vee}\circ m_V.$$ However, my problem ultimately ends up being that I can't interpret $\phi^{\vee\vee}$ sufficiently well. It should take linear maps $\operatorname{Hom}(V,k)\to k$ to linear maps $\operatorname{Hom}(W,k)\to k$ in a way that is somehow induced by $\phi$, but I'm not sure what this way is. My attempt: $$[\phi^{\vee\vee}(f:V^{\vee}\to k)](g:W\to k)\in k$$ but I get no further than this.

78,How do you find all solutions to the matrix equation $XAX=A^T$?,How do you find all solutions to the matrix equation ?,XAX=A^T,"I was recently asked to solve a problem in a programming interview involving word squares , and on further reflection I realized it could be recast as a linear algebra question. Since my solution has a worst-case time complexity of $O(n!)$ if $n$ is the width of $A$, out of personal curiosity I'm trying to find a better solution, as measured by worst-case time complexity. Given an $n$ by $n$ square matrix $A$ over the reals with $n\geq 2$, is there an $n$ by $n$ permutation matrix $X$ satisfying $$XA=(XA)^T?$$ Since $(XA)^T=A^TX^T$ and $X$ is a permutation matrix, we have $X^T=X^{-1}$, hence this is equivalent to asking if there are any solutions to $$XAX=A^T$$ which are permutation matrices. Naively, I was hoping there would be a unique solution, but numeric techniques strongly indicate a wide variety of solutions, even when a satisfactory permutation exists. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem that solutions form a linear subspace. For example, if $X$ is a solution, then $(aX)A(aX)=a^2A^T$ for any real $a$, so most multiples of $X$ are not solutions for most matrices $A$. Similar problems exist for sums of solutions. With this in mind, I'm not quite sure which method one might use to enumerate solutions. If they don't form a linear subspace, we can't just enumerate a basis. Any partial solutions, theorems, pointers in the right direction, or related problems would be helpful. I'm not familiar with what seems to be a nonlinear matrix equation (if that's the right terminology). Update This seems to be a special case of something called the algebraic Riccati equation , as indicated in another question . The techniques I have found so far emphasize one of two approaches: Algorithms for finding any solution from a given starting guess. Algorithms for finding the unique stabilizing solution, should one exist. Given the control theoretic background for those approaches, they typically assume that $A^T$ is symmetric. In my case, if $A^T$ were symmetric I could simply take $X$ to be the identity and be done, and that assumption oversimplifies the problem. Additionally, those solutions do not seem to have a clean way to enumerate all solutions, inhibiting one from checking if any happen to be permutation matrices. Does anyone have more tips from a Riccati equation standpoint? I would like to add that strictly speaking one can answer the question in finite time by simply enumerating all permutation matrices of the appropriate size and checking if they satisfy $XA=(XA)^T$. For some reason I'm having trouble describing, I don't think this captures the spirit of the question. Update @GCab points out that $A$ would need a very peculiar structure for $X$ to be a permutation matrix. This is indeed the case, and $A$ would need to be symmetric on some row or column permutation. This does yield some insights. If $X$ is any permutation matrix, then $$(XAX)_{ij}=A_{ji}=(A^T)_{ij}$$ for any $i$, $j$ so that $X_{ij}=1$, and this does not hold when $X_{ij}=0$. In other words, the elements of $A$ come in pairs except for possibly the main diagonal of $XA$. Using this, one can rule out many possible permutations, since any element appearing only once in $A^T$ must give a location of a $1$ in $X$. There are many other such combinatorial tricks that can greatly improve the average runtime. One can similarly note that for a permutation $X$ to exist as a solution, there must exist a bijection $f$ between the rows and columns of $A$ so that if $r$ is a row of $A$ then the count of each element of $r$ is the same as its count in $f(r)$. Such a heuristic has the potential to easily classify a choice of $A$ as not having a satisfactory solution, but it could still take an enormous amount of time to confirm that a given $A$ does have a satisfactory $X$.","I was recently asked to solve a problem in a programming interview involving word squares , and on further reflection I realized it could be recast as a linear algebra question.

Any partial solutions, theorems, pointers in the right direction, or related problems would be helpful. I'm not familiar with what seems to be a nonlinear matrix equation (if that's the right terminology). Update This seems to be a special case of something called the algebraic Riccati equation , as indicated in another question . The techniques I have found so far emphasize one of two approaches: Algorithms for finding any solution from a given starting guess. Algorithms for finding the unique stabilizing solution, should one exist. Given the control theoretic background for those approaches, they typically assume that $A^T$ is symmetric. In my case, if $A^T$ were symmetric I could simply take $X$ to be the identity and be done, and that assumption oversimplifies the problem. Additionally, those solutions do not seem to have a clean way to enumerate all solutions, inhibiting one from checking if any happen to be permutation matrices. Does anyone have more tips from a Riccati equation standpoint? I would like to add that strictly speaking one can answer the question in finite time by simply enumerating all permutation matrices of the appropriate size and checking if they satisfy $XA=(XA)^T$. For some reason I'm having trouble describing, I don't think this captures the spirit of the question. Update @GCab points out that $A$ would need a very peculiar structure for $X$ to be a permutation matrix. This is indeed the case, and $A$ would need to be symmetric on some row or column permutation. This does yield some insights. If $X$ is any permutation matrix, then $$(XAX)_{ij}=A_{ji}=(A^T)_{ij}$$ for any $i$, $j$ so that $X_{ij}=1$, and this does not hold when $X_{ij}=0$. In other words, the elements of $A$ come in pairs except for possibly the main diagonal of $XA$. Using this, one can rule out many possible permutations, since any element appearing only once in $A^T$ must give a location of a $1$ in $X$. There are many other such combinatorial tricks that can greatly improve the average runtime. One can similarly note that for a permutation $X$ to exist as a solution, there must exist a bijection $f$ between the rows and columns of $A$ so that if $r$ is a row of $A$ then the count of each element of $r$ is the same as its count in $f(r)$. Such a heuristic has the potential to easily classify a choice of $A$ as not having a satisfactory solution, but it could still take an enormous amount of time to confirm that a given $A$ does have a satisfactory $X$.",,"['linear-algebra', 'matrices', 'systems-of-equations', 'matrix-equations', 'permutation-matrices']"

Step 3 below is where I am stuck. Step 1 : One can write $M$ as $M_kM_{k-1}\cdots M_1$ where $M_i=I_n-p_ip_i'$ and $\{p_1,\ldots,p_k\}$ is a set of $n\times 1$ mutually orthogonal vectors s.t. $||p_i||=1$. Proof. $M$, by assumption, can be written as $M=I_n-X(X'X)^{-1}X'$ where $X$ is $n\times k$ with full column rank. Let $P=(p_1,\ldots,p_k)$ (dimension $n\times k$) be the $Q$ bit of the QR decomposition of $X$. Step 2 : Let $T=(T_1,\ldots,T_n)$ be an $n\times n$ matrix of orthonormal eigenvectors of $A$ that corresponds to eigenvalues $\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_n$. Let $l_{1i}=T_i'p_1$.

Write out $I_n\theta-(I_n-l_1l_1')\Lambda$ in full. Subtract $l_2/l_1$ times the first row from the second row, $l_3/l_1$ times the first row from the third row, and so on, and then execute the Laplace expansion along the first row. The result is   $$ 0=|I_n\theta-(I_n-l_1l_1')\Lambda|=\prod_{j=1}^n(\theta-\lambda_j)+\sum_{i=1}^nl_{1i}^2\lambda_{i}\prod_{j\neq i}(\theta-\lambda_j). $$   Plugging $\theta=0$ in the rightmost expression above gives $\sum_{i=1}^2l_{1i}^2=1$. Thus,    \begin{align*} 0&=\sum_{i=1}^nl_{1i}^2\prod_{j=1}^n(\theta-\lambda_j)+\sum_{i=1}^nl_i^2\lambda_{i}\prod_{j\neq i}(\theta-\lambda_j)\\ &=\sum_{i=1}^nl_{1i}^2(\theta-\lambda_i)\prod_{j\neq i}(\theta-\lambda_j)+\sum_{i=1}^nl_i^2\lambda_{i}\prod_{j\neq i}(\theta-\lambda_j) \end{align*}   which can be simplified and, for $\theta\neq 0$, divided by $\theta$ to get ($**$).

Either $f(\lambda_r)=0$ or $f(\lambda_{r+1})=0$ or $f(\lambda_r)f(\lambda_{r+1})\neq 0$. It's easy to show that in general $f(\lambda_r)f(\lambda_{r+1})\leq 0$ and so if $f(\lambda_r)f(\lambda_{r+1})\neq 0$ then $f(\lambda_r)f(\lambda_{r+1})< 0$ and so by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there is an zero of $f$ between $(\lambda_r,\lambda_{r+1})$. In sum, there is a zero of $f$ in each $[\lambda_r,\lambda_{r+1}]$ for each $r=1,\ldots,n-1$. It follows that   $$ 0<\lambda_1\leq\theta_1^{(1)}\leq\lambda_2\leq \theta_2^{(1)}\leq\cdots\leq \theta_{n-1}^{(1)}\leq\lambda_n. $$   This proves ($***$) for $s=1$.

The case for $s=1$ and $M_1A$ relies on $A$ being diagonalizable. I don't think the same argument works for $M_2(M_1A)$ because we don't know the diagonalizability of $M_1A$. So I don't think the induction step in Step 3 works (Durbin and Watson (1950) claim it does.). Moreover, while I'm confident in the Intermediate Value Theorem argument, I'm not confident about the subsequent claim: It follows that $$ 0<\lambda_1\leq\theta_1^{(1)}\leq\lambda_2\leq \theta_2^{(1)}\leq\cdots\leq \theta_{n-1}^{(1)}\leq\lambda_n. $$","Suppose that $M$ is symmetric idempotent $n\times n$ and has rank $n-k$.

Proceed with $M_2M_1A$ as $M_2(M_1A)$ to get ($***$) for $s=2$. And so on. Step 4 : ($*$) holds. Proof. By Step 3, for $i=1,\ldots,n-k$,   $$ \nu_i=\theta_i^{(k)}\geq \theta_i^{(k-1)}\geq  \cdots \geq \theta_i^{(1)} \geq \theta_i^{(0)}=\lambda_i. $$   Similarly,   $$ \nu_i=\theta_i^{(k)}\geq \theta_{i+1}^{(k-1)}\geq  \cdots \geq \theta_{i+k-1}^{(1)} \geq \theta_{i+k}^{(0)}=\lambda_{i+k}. $$ Problem with Step 3 . The case for $s=1$ and $M_1A$ relies on $A$ being diagonalizable. I don't think the same argument works for $M_2(M_1A)$ because we don't know the diagonalizability of $M_1A$. So I don't think the induction step in Step 3 works (Durbin and Watson (1950) claim it does.). Moreover, while I'm confident in the Intermediate Value Theorem argument, I'm not confident about the subsequent claim: It follows that $$ 0<\lambda_1\leq\theta_1^{(1)}\leq\lambda_2\leq \theta_2^{(1)}\leq\cdots\leq \theta_{n-1}^{(1)}\leq\lambda_n. $$",,"['linear-algebra', 'matrices', 'inequality', 'proof-verification', 'eigenvalues-eigenvectors']"

For example, a skew-symmetric matrix on its own can be interpreted as an infinitesimal rotation.  As an another example, the polar decomposition of a matrix A=UP=QU for a unitary matrix U and symmetric positive definite matrices P and Q means that we can interpret a matrix as a stretching (the positive definite matrix) followed by a rotation (the unitary matrix) or vice versa. Basically, the decomposition of a matrix into its symmetric and skew symmetric parts $A=(1/2)(A+A^T)+(1/2)(A-A^T)$ is causing me problems because I don't know how to geometrically interpret the symmetric part (if it was positive definite it would be a stretch) nor the sum (if it was a product then one action would follow the other.) Edit 1 The answer from @user_of_math helped me figure the rest of this out. Assume that we have a matrix $B$ thats symmetric.  Then, we know that it has a spectral decomposition $B=VDV^T$.  What this says is that the action of $B$ on a vector $x$ occurs in three steps We determine how much we will project $x$ onto the columns of $V$, $V^T x$ We scale this projection by the eigenvalues of $A$, $D V^T x$ Then, we put everything back into the original coordinate axis, $V D V^T x$ In other words, a symmetric operator scales the space along the orthogonal axes defined by $V$.  When $B$ is positive definite, the elements of $D$ are positive and this is a stretch.  When $B$ is indefinite or negative definite, we can potentially flip or collapse an axis.  In any case, provides one explanation of the geometric the meaning of a symmetric operator. Now, let $C$ be a skew-symmetric operator.  Then, $exp(C)$ is orthonormal matrix, which corresponds to a rotation. At this point, we have an idea of what happens with a symmetric operator and a skew-symmetric operator, but there's a disconnect because our explanation assumed the skew-symmetric operator corresponds to something infinitesimal and the symmetric operator does not.  As such, consider an infinitesimal shift of a vector x by a symmetric operator B $$ \lim\limits_{\alpha\rightarrow 0} (I+\alpha B)x $$ More specifically, we want to do an infinite number of these transformations, so we have $$ \lim\limits_{n\rightarrow\infty} \left(I+\frac{1}{n} B\right)^n x = exp(B)x $$ Now, since $B$ is symmetric, we have the spectral decomposition, $B=VDV^T$.  Hence, $$ exp(B)x=exp(VDV^T)x=Vexp(D)V^Tx, $$ which is interesting because this says that $exp(B)$ is a positive definite operator.  In other words, and infinite number of shifts by a symmetric operator eventually yields a single stretch by a positive definite operator. In any case, let's look at the general situation now.  Let $B=(A+A^T)/2$ be the symmetric part of $A$ and $B=(A-A^T)/2$ be the skew-symmetric part.  Then, consider an infinite number of shifts by $A$, $$ \lim\limits_{n\rightarrow\infty} \left(I+\frac{1}{n} A\right)^n  = exp(A) = exp(B+C) = \lim\limits_{n\rightarrow \infty}(exp(B/n)exp(C/n))^n $$ where the last equality comes from the Lie product formula.  This says that the meaning of $exp(A)$ is an infinite, alternating application of infinitesimally small stretches, defined by $exp((A+A^T)/2)$, and rotations, defined by $exp((A-A^T)/2)$.

95,$3\times 3$ matrices over $GF(3)$ which satisfy $A^{-1}=(A^T)^2$,matrices over  which satisfy,3\times 3 GF(3) A^{-1}=(A^T)^2,"I came across this question on Quora : How many $3\times 3$ matrices over the finite field $\{0,1,2\}$ satisfy the condition $A^{-1}=(A^T)^2$ ? Thanks to NumPy, with sheer brute-force , I found that there are $33$ such matrices. (You may go through the code and the output.) I believe that there is a more elegant/algebraic approach to this problem because of the following observations I made: $A^{-1}=(A^T)^2\implies \det A= 1$ so there can be at most $\dfrac{(3^3-1)(3^3-3)(3^3-3^2)}{3-1}=5616\tag*{}$ such matrices. ( Order of special linear group .) All of them are symmetric i.e., $A^T=A$ . (I don't know how to prove this but it's supported by observation.) All of them satisfy $A^3=I$ . (As a consequence of 2) All of them have zero trace i.e., sum of the diagonal elements is $0$ . (I don't know how to prove this either.) There is only one such matrix which has $(1,1,1)$ on the diagonal. It is the identity matrix. There are four matrices each which have $(2,2,2)$ or $(0,0,0)$ on their diagonal. For each permutation $\sigma$ of $0$ , $1$ , $2$ , there are four matrices such that $\text{diag}(A)=\sigma$ . This accounts for the $1+4+4+3!\cdot 4=33$ such matrices. I would want to know why $(2)$ and $(4)$ are true. Here's a short summary: For a matrix $A$ over the field of three elements, it looks like: $$A^{-1}=(A^T)^2 \iff  \begin{array}\ A^T=A\\ \text{det }A=1\\  A^3=I \end{array}\implies \text{tr}(A)=0$$ However, I don't have a proof, it's just observations. Update: After a long discussion in comments, it is clear to me why $(2)$ and $(4)$ are true. Why (2) is true? You can rewrite the given condition as $A^T=(A^TA)^{-1}$ ; now take transpose on both sides to get $A=(AA^T)^{-1}$ and now, use these facts: The product of a matrix and its transpose is always symmetric. The inverse (if exists) of a symmetric matrix is symmetric. Why (4) is true? $1$ is the eigen value of $A^3$ with algebraic multiplicity of $3$ ... This means that eigenvalues of $A$ are of the form cube-root of unity. There is only one cube root of unity in this field. It is $1$ iteself. So the eigenvalues of $A$ are $1,1,1$ . Thus, $\text{tr}(A)=1+1+1=0$ . Account for 33 solutions : I think I have also got an idea for a more elegant approach which accounts for the $33$ solutions. I don't know if there is any fallacy in my logic, it is not at all rigorous :( The properties $A^3=I$ and $A^T=A$ are preserved under conjugation by a non-singular diagonal matrix in this field . What I mean is that: Let $D$ be a non-singular diagonal matrix (there are $2^3$ choices because $0$ can't be diagonal entry). If $A$ is a solution, $DAD^{-1}$ is also a solution. Reason : $\mathbb Z_3^*$ is a cyclic group of order two and the group of diagonal matrices is isomorphic to $\mathbb Z_3^*\times \mathbb Z_3^*\times \mathbb Z_3^*$ which is Boolean group. Hence, $D^2=I$ . This implies that $D^{-1}=D=D^{T}$ . Thus, the conjugate $DAD^{-1}=DAD^T=(DAD^{-1})^T$ is symmetric. Also, notice that $(DAD^{-1})^3=DA^3D^{-1}=I$ . Another point to note is that Conjugation by a diagonal matrix preserves the diagonal… I mean that $\text{diag}(DAD^{-1})=\text{diag}(A)$ . Reason: When you left multiply $A$ by a diagonal matrix $D$ , each row $i$ is scaled by $D_{ii}$ . Following that right multiplication by $D^{-1}$ , scales each column $i$ by $1/D_{ii}$ . As a result, the diagonal elements remain unscaled and intact. Given a solution $A$ with $\text{diag}(A)=(1,2,0)$ , how many $D$ -conjugates of $A$ exist? $D$ and $-D$ yield the same conjugate because $DAD^{-1}=(-D)A(-D)^{-1}$ … We have $8/2=4$ unique diagonal matrices upto sign, each of which yield a unique $D$ -conjugate of $A$ . These conjugates have the same diagonal as $A$ and also satisfy our condition. Likewise, for every solution $A$ with $\text{diag}(A)=(2,2,2)$ or $(2,1,0)$ , etc. (we make sure the trace is zero), we have $4$ solutions each by conjugating $A$ with diagonal matrices. $A=I$ is an exception because $DID^{-1}=I$ so we don’t get any new solution. Leaving $(1,1,1)$ aside, there are $8$ other arrangements for the diagonal entries which make the trace zero: $(0,0,0)$ , $(2,2,2)$ or some permutation of $(1,2,0)$ . For each of these types of arrangements along the diagonal, it is observed that there is at least one solution, which can be $D$ -conjugated to generate new solutions. \begin{array}{|c|c|}\hline \text{diag}(A) & \text{No. of $D$-conjugates}\\ \hline (1,1,1)&1\\ \hline(0,0,0)&4\\ \hline (2,2,2)&4\\ \hline (1,2,0)&4\\ \hline (1,0,2)&4\\ \hline (0,1,2)&4\\ \hline (0,2,1)&4\\ \hline (2,1,0)&4\\ \hline (2,0,1)&4\\ \hline \end{array} That makes the count $8\times 4+1=33$ .","I came across this question on Quora : How many matrices over the finite field satisfy the condition ?

This is my solution : I will assume $F \in C^2$ and $\nabla F$ is always non-zero. First a bit of notation : I use the euclidean metric on $\mathbb{R}^2$ thus I identify matrices with biliniear forms, if $A$ is a ( $2 \times 2$ ) matrix by $A \geq 0$ I mean $$(Ax,x) \geq 0 \;\; \forall x \in \mathbb{R}^2$$ by $A \leq B$ I mean $B - A \geq 0$ , or equivalently $$(Ax,x) \leq (Bx,x) \;\; \forall x \in \mathbb{R}^2$$ I claim that if $A$ is a symmetric matrix and $B$ is any matrix such that $0 \leq A \leq B$ then $\ker(B) \subset \ker(A)$ To show it observe that, since $A$ is symmetric, up to a rotation I can assume it is diagonal,so there are $\lambda,\mu \geq 0$ so that $$ 		A= 		\left( {\begin{array}{cc} 				\lambda & 0 \\ 				0 & \mu \\ 		\end{array} } \right) 		$$ then if $B v = 0$ and $v = (v_1,v_2)$ I find $0 \leq \lambda (v_1)^2 + \mu(v_2)^2 \leq 0$ which clearly implies $\lambda v_1 = \mu v_2 = 0$ so $A v = 0$ which shows the claim Now back to the exercise I assume $F \in C^2$ , thus $1/F \in C^2$ and so convexity implies $\nabla^2 F \geq 0$ , $\nabla^2 1/F \geq 0$ . I calculate $\nabla^2 \frac{1}{F}$ \begin{equation}\nabla^2 \frac{1}{F} = \frac{2}{F^3}\nabla F \otimes \nabla F - \frac{1}{F^2}\nabla^2 F \geq 0\end{equation} from this I easily find \begin{equation} 0 \leq \nabla^2 F \leq \frac{2}{F} (\nabla F \otimes \nabla F) \end{equation} so using the previous claim $\ker(\nabla F \otimes \nabla F) \subset \ker(\nabla^2 F)$ but clearly $\ker(\nabla F) \subset \ker(\nabla F \otimes \nabla F)$ . Now let $$\mathcal{N}(x,y,\underline{v}) =  \left( {\begin{array}{cc} 		\nabla F(x,y)\cdot \underline{v}  \\ 		\underline{v} \cdot \underline{v} - 1 \\ \end{array} } \right) $$ I want to use implicit differentiation theorem to find $v = v(x,y)$ , so I differentiate $\mathcal{N}$ with respect to $v$ $$\nabla_{\underline{v}}{\mathcal{N}} =  \left( {\begin{array}{cc} 		\nabla F(x,y)  \\ 		2\underline{v} \\ \end{array} } \right) $$ by definition if $\mathcal{N}(x,y,\underline{v}) = 0$ then the two vectors are orthogonal and they are both non-zero thus $\nabla_{\underline{v}}{\mathcal{N}}$ is invertible and $$\nabla_{x,y}{\underline{v}} = (\nabla_{\underline{v}}{\mathcal{N}})^{-1}( \nabla_{x,y}{\mathcal{N}})$$ but I have that $$\nabla_{x,y}{\mathcal{N}} = 	\left( {\begin{array}{cc} 		\nabla^2F(x,y) \cdot v  \\ 		\underline{0} \\ \end{array} }  \right) = \left( {\begin{array}{cc} 		\underline{0}  \\ 		\underline{0} \\ \end{array} }  \right) $$ and here I'm using $\underline{v} \in \ker{\nabla F} \subset \ker{\nabla^2 F}$ thus $\nabla_{x,y}{\underline{v}} = 0$ . Now fix $\underline{w}$ so that it has norm $1$ and $\nabla F(0,0) \cdot \underline{w} = 0$ , Let $U := \{ (x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \; : \; \mathcal{N}(x,y,w) = 0\}$ .\ The set is nonempty since $(0,0) \in U$ , and by what we have shown the set is open, therefore it's $U =\mathbb{R}^2$ , but this shows that $\nabla F(x,y) \cdot w = 0$ for all $(x,y)$ and this concludes the proof.","Let be a strictly positive function such that are both convex.

Dualizing degreewise this structure, we get an algebra structure on the graded dual $$(\Lambda M)' = \bigoplus_{k=0}^∞ (\Lambda^k M)^*.$$ This is an anticommutative alternating graded algebra (which can be deduced from the fact that $\Lambda M → \Lambda (M⊕M)$ is a morphism of algebras, without computation), so by the universal property of $\Lambda (M^*)$ , the morphism $M^* → (\Lambda M)'$ gives an algebra morphism $\Lambda (M^*) → (\Lambda M)'$ and thus an action on $\Lambda M$ .

I conjecture that the optimal value of the problem is bounded below by $a^2 \lambda_1 + \left(1-a^2\right)\lambda_2$ , at least if $a$ is small enough. To motivate this conjecture, let us consider two special cases. First, suppose that $a= 0$ . Then, as was explained to me in one of my previous posts, the optimal value is between $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ by the Courant-Fischer theorem. Thus, $\lambda_2$ is a lower bound, and it also coincides with my conjectured lower bound in this special case. Second, let $a > 0$ but suppose that $b = z_i$ for some $i = 1,...,k$ . Any feasible $x$ can be written as $$x = ab + \sqrt{1-a^2} \cdot \hat{b}$$ where $\hat{b}\perp b$ . If $b = z_1$ , I can take $\hat{b} = z_2$ , and if $b = z_i$ for $i \neq 1$ , I can take $\hat{b} = z_1$ . Either way, the objective value of $x$ is bounded below by $a^2 \lambda_1 + \left(1-a^2\right)\lambda_2$ as long as $a$ is small enough (note that this requires $\lambda_1 > \lambda_2$ ). The difficulty is showing that it holds in the case where $b$ is not one of the eigenvectors of $B$ (perhaps with additional restrictions on how large $a$ can be). My intuition is that, if $b$ is not required to be orthogonal to $x$ , but only ""almost"" orthogonal (meaning that $a$ may be required to be sufficiently small), you should be able to go a bit further in the direction of the principal eigenvector than in the case where $a = 0$ . Here is the most up-to-date work on this problem. In the answer below, it was found that the optimal value $v$ of the problem is a generalized eigenvalue of the system $$PBx = vPx,$$ which in turn was derived from the system $$PBPy + aPBb = v Py.$$ Any pair $\left(y,v\right)$ that solves these equations then leads to a feasible $x = ab+Py$ , with $v$ being the objective value. We can write $$\left(vI - PB\right)Py = aPBb.$$ Note that, for any $v$ that is not an eigenvalue of $PB$ , the matrix $vI-PB$ is invertible, whence $$Py = a\left(vI-PB\right)^{-1}PBb.$$ The normalization $x^\top x = 1$ then becomes $y^\top P y = 1-a^2$ , leading to the equation $$\frac{1-a^2}{a^2} = b^\top BP\left(vI-PB\right)^{-2} PBb.$$ The largest root of this equation is the optimal value of the problem. Perhaps, as suggested, it can be found numerically.","This builds on my earlier questions here and here .

I have a conjecture (stated in two ways below), which I would like to see whether it is true (both the inequality part and the part involving the equality cases).  The motivation comes from this thread .  The conjecture (both the inequality part and the equality cases) is known to be true when the base field $\mathbb{K}$ has the property that, for any positive integer $l$ , the only solution $(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_l)\in\mathbb{K}^l$ to $$x_1^2+x_2^2+\ldots+x_l^2=0$$ is $x_1=x_2=\ldots=x_l=0$ .  Subfields of $\mathbb{R}$ are examples, but there are other fields with this property such as pure transcendental extensions of $\mathbb{R}$ and ordered fields.  (They are all fields of characteristic $0$ , by the way.) Conjecture (Version I). Let $\mathbb{K}$ be a field.  Let $\mathcal{V}$ and $\mathcal{W}$ be two finite-dimensional vector spaces over $\mathbb{K}$ with dimensions $n$ and $m$ , respectively.  For an integer $r$ such that $$0\leq r\leq \min\{m,n\}\,,$$ suppose that $\mathcal{T}$ is a subspace of the $\mathbb{K}$ -vector space $\text{Hom}_{\mathbb{K}}(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{W})$ such that every linear transformation $\varphi:\mathcal{V}\to \mathcal{W}$ in $\mathcal{T}$ is of rank at most $r$ .  Then, $$\dim_\mathbb{K}(\mathcal{T})\leq r\,\max\{m,n\}\,.$$ Here are the equality cases. (a) For $m< n$ , there exists an $r$ -dimensional subspace $\mathcal{I}$ of $\mathcal{W}$ such that $\mathcal{T}$ consists of linear transformations $\varphi$ such that $\text{im}(\varphi)\subseteq \mathcal{I}$ . (b) For $m>n$ , there exists an $(n-r)$ -dimensional subspace $\mathcal{K}$ of $\mathcal{V}$ such that $\mathcal{T}$ consists of linear transformations $\varphi$ such that $\ker(\varphi)\supseteq \mathcal{K}$ . (c) For $m=n$ , there are two possibilities.

Conjecture (Version II). Let $\mathbb{K}$ be a field.  For integers $m,n>0$ and $r$ such that $$0\leq r\leq \min\{m,n\}\,,$$ suppose that $\mathcal{M}$ is a $\mathbb{K}$ -vector subspace of the $\mathbb{K}$ -vector space $\text{Mat}_{m\times n}(\mathbb{K})$ such that each matrix in $\mathcal{M}$ is of rank at most $r$ .  Then, $$\dim_\mathbb{K}(\mathcal{M})\leq r\,\max\{m,n\}\,.$$ Here are the equality cases. (a) For $m< n$ , there exists an $r$ -dimensional subspace $\mathcal{C}$ of $\mathbb{K}^m$ such that $\mathcal{M}$ consists of matrices whose column spaces are contained in $\mathcal{C}$ . (b) For $m> n$ , there exists an $r$ -dimensional subspace $\mathcal{R}$ of $\mathbb{K}^n$ such that $\mathcal{M}$ consists of matrices whose row spaces are contained in $\mathcal{R}$ . (c) For $m=n$ , there are two possibilites. There exists an $r$ -dimensional subspace $\mathcal{C}$ of $\mathbb{K}^m$ such that $\mathcal{M}$ consists of matrices whose column spaces are contained in $\mathcal{C}$ . There exists an $r$ -dimensional subspace $\mathcal{R}$ of $\mathbb{K}^n$ such that $\mathcal{M}$ consists of matrices whose row spaces are contained in $\mathcal{R}$ . Warning. While I am quite confident that the inequality is true, I am not very sure that I got the equality cases right.  If there are counterexamples, I would love to see. Remark. I just noticed that joriki posted this reference under the question here .  I have not yet digested it, but it seems says that the inequality holds when $m=n$ for any field $\mathbb{K}$ .
