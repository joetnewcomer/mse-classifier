17,Iterated integer-valued decimation,Iterated integer-valued decimation,,"This question is for those who have wondered what it means to decimate an army when the number of soldiers is not a multiple of ten. I am interested in really good upper bounds on the length of a certain finite sequence.  I will define the sequence and then show what is, I think, a pretty good upper bound on its length.  A colleague of mine suggested that one should be able to do better, and I realize that I don't know much about what kind of tools ought to be brought to bear on this type of elementary, but nontrivial problem. By $\mathbb{N}$ I mean the natural numbers: $\{0,1,2,\ldots\}$.  Let $d$ be a positive integer, and consider the ""$d$-decimation function"" $D_d: N \mapsto N - \lceil \frac{N}{d} \rceil$. You can think about this function as follows (and this is how it arises in my intended application): we have $N$ discrete objects and we place each into one of $d$ boxes.  Then we are allowed to remove all the objects from any one box.  If we want to minimize the number of objects remaining, we simply choose the box which has the most (or tied for the most) objects.  By the Pigeonhole Principle at least one box must have $\frac{N}{d}$ objects.  But because everything is integer-valued, there must in fact be a box with at least $\lceil \frac{N}{d} \rceil$ objects, hence if we empty that box we are left with at most $D_d(N)$ objects. Now we redistribute the remaining objects in the (still $d$ -- we don't remove the box, just empty it) boxes and repeat.  Thus for $i \geq 1$ define $D_d^i = D_d \circ \ldots \circ D_d: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$, the $i$-fold composition.  Because $D_d(N) < N$ for all $N \geq 1$, for each $N \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ there is some $i$ such that $D_d^i(N) = 0$.  We define the d-decimation length of $N$ to be the least such $i$ and denote it by $\ell_d(N)$.  I want really good upper bounds on $\ell_d(N)$. Some quick comments: For all $N \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ we have $D_1(N) = 0$, so $\ell_1(N) = 1$. For all $N \leq d$ we have $D_d(N) = N-1$, so $\ell_d(N) = N$ if $d \geq N$. So the interesting case is $2 \leq d < N$: let's assume that. I will now give the upper bound that I know.  It comes from the fact that $D_d(N) = N - \lceil \frac{N}{d} \rceil \leq N - \frac{N}{d} = (1-\frac{1}{d})N$, so $D_d^i(N) \leq N (1-\frac{1}{d})^i$. Since $e^x$ is convex, it lies above its tangent line, thus $1+x \leq e^x$ for all $x$, with strict inequality for all $x \neq 0$.  Using this we get $N (1-\frac{1}{d})^i < N e^{\frac{-i}{d}}$ If we choose $i$ such that $N e^{\frac{-i}{d}} < d$, then $D_d^i(N) < d$, so $D_d^{i+d-1} = 0$ and $\ell_d(N) \leq i + d-1$.  An easy calculation shows that we can take $i = \lceil d \log \frac{N}{d} \rceil$, so $\ell_d(N) \leq \lceil d \log \frac{N}{d} \rceil + d-1 < d (1+\log \frac{N}{d})$. I would like to do better than this.  My colleague says that one can get instead $\ell(d) \leq d(\gamma + \epsilon + \log \frac{N}{d})$, where $\gamma = 0.577\ldots$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant and $\epsilon$ approaches $0$ as $\min(d,\frac{N}{d})$ approaches infinity.  (I certainly believe him; I just don't understand how to get this.)  He also suggests a better bound involving partial sums of the harmonic series which is valid in all cases.  More than anything, I would like to see how someone who knows what they are doing attacks this kind of problem.","This question is for those who have wondered what it means to decimate an army when the number of soldiers is not a multiple of ten. I am interested in really good upper bounds on the length of a certain finite sequence.  I will define the sequence and then show what is, I think, a pretty good upper bound on its length.  A colleague of mine suggested that one should be able to do better, and I realize that I don't know much about what kind of tools ought to be brought to bear on this type of elementary, but nontrivial problem. By $\mathbb{N}$ I mean the natural numbers: $\{0,1,2,\ldots\}$.  Let $d$ be a positive integer, and consider the ""$d$-decimation function"" $D_d: N \mapsto N - \lceil \frac{N}{d} \rceil$. You can think about this function as follows (and this is how it arises in my intended application): we have $N$ discrete objects and we place each into one of $d$ boxes.  Then we are allowed to remove all the objects from any one box.  If we want to minimize the number of objects remaining, we simply choose the box which has the most (or tied for the most) objects.  By the Pigeonhole Principle at least one box must have $\frac{N}{d}$ objects.  But because everything is integer-valued, there must in fact be a box with at least $\lceil \frac{N}{d} \rceil$ objects, hence if we empty that box we are left with at most $D_d(N)$ objects. Now we redistribute the remaining objects in the (still $d$ -- we don't remove the box, just empty it) boxes and repeat.  Thus for $i \geq 1$ define $D_d^i = D_d \circ \ldots \circ D_d: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$, the $i$-fold composition.  Because $D_d(N) < N$ for all $N \geq 1$, for each $N \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ there is some $i$ such that $D_d^i(N) = 0$.  We define the d-decimation length of $N$ to be the least such $i$ and denote it by $\ell_d(N)$.  I want really good upper bounds on $\ell_d(N)$. Some quick comments: For all $N \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ we have $D_1(N) = 0$, so $\ell_1(N) = 1$. For all $N \leq d$ we have $D_d(N) = N-1$, so $\ell_d(N) = N$ if $d \geq N$. So the interesting case is $2 \leq d < N$: let's assume that. I will now give the upper bound that I know.  It comes from the fact that $D_d(N) = N - \lceil \frac{N}{d} \rceil \leq N - \frac{N}{d} = (1-\frac{1}{d})N$, so $D_d^i(N) \leq N (1-\frac{1}{d})^i$. Since $e^x$ is convex, it lies above its tangent line, thus $1+x \leq e^x$ for all $x$, with strict inequality for all $x \neq 0$.  Using this we get $N (1-\frac{1}{d})^i < N e^{\frac{-i}{d}}$ If we choose $i$ such that $N e^{\frac{-i}{d}} < d$, then $D_d^i(N) < d$, so $D_d^{i+d-1} = 0$ and $\ell_d(N) \leq i + d-1$.  An easy calculation shows that we can take $i = \lceil d \log \frac{N}{d} \rceil$, so $\ell_d(N) \leq \lceil d \log \frac{N}{d} \rceil + d-1 < d (1+\log \frac{N}{d})$.

37,Prove convergence using $\varepsilon$-$N$ definition,Prove convergence using - definition,\varepsilon N,"This is an example presented by professor in class. I understand the idea behind this kind of definition, but I'm having trouble following my professor's thought process. We must prove that the $\displaystyle \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{2n-1}{n^2} = 0$ using the $\varepsilon$-$N$ definition of a limit of a sequence. So, the foregoing limit is true iff $\forall \varepsilon>0,\  \exists N(\varepsilon)>0 : \forall n \ ( n \geq N \Rightarrow |f(n) - 0| < \varepsilon)$. Now, the way I understand it is that if we prove the conditional statement by choosing an appropriate $N$, we've proven the limit. So first we fix $\varepsilon>0$ since it's given, and play around with $$\displaystyle \left| \frac{2n-1}{n^2} \right| < \varepsilon $$  $$|2n-1| < \varepsilon \ n^2 .$$ We note that $|2n-1|<|2n|$ which sits right with me. However, my professor then reasons that $|2n-1|<|2n|<\varepsilon \ n^2$ and so $2n < \varepsilon \ n^2$. How do we know that $2n < \varepsilon \ n^2$? If epsilon is really small, wouldn't there be a point when this inequality is no longer true? This is what is bothering me. From that we conclude that $\displaystyle n>\frac{\varepsilon}{2}$ and choose $\displaystyle N=\frac{\varepsilon}{2}$ so that $$n \geq \frac{\varepsilon}{2} \Rightarrow \left| \frac{2n-1}{n^2} \right| < \varepsilon$$ is always true.

It is clear that terms of trace fulfills the conditions $t_0+t_1+...+t_p=m\,$ $t_1+2t_2+...+pt_p=c_0+c_1+...+c_{m-1}\,$ Denote by $t^{0}(c)=c\,$ $t^{n}(c)=t(t^{n-1}(c))\,$ 1.The set of sequences $B=\{(1,0,0,1),(2,2),(0,0,2),(2,0,1),(1,1,1),(0,3)\}\,$ that is cycle of length 6 is called '''bracelet of sequences''' because for each sequence $c$ from $B$ holds $t^6 (c)=c\,$ 2.The set of sequences $R=\{(0,1,1),(1,2)\}\,$ that is cycle of length 2 is called '''ring of sequences''' because for each sequence $c $ from $R$ holds $t^2 (c)=c\,$ The set $ H=B\cup R\,$  is called ''' black hole of sequences''' Reasons for that name are because I suppose that: Claim: For each finite sequence $a$ of natural numbers exists natural number $n$ such that $t^n(a)\in H\,$   in other words each sequence converges to $H$. Sequence $a$ is of type $B$ if its converge to $H$ from $B$ for example sequence $(2,3)$ is of type $B$ because $t^3((2,3))=(0,0,2)\in B\,$ And sequences that converges to $H$ from $R$ are of type $R$ for example the sequence $(0)$ is of type $R$ because $t^6((0))=(1,2)\in R\,$ My questions are. Is my assumption true If it is true how to decide of which type is any given finite sequence of natural numbers Can be done any programme or algorithme to determine of which type is certain sequence.

For reference, a set $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}_{\geq 2}$ is called primitive if no element of $S$ divides any other. I'm particularly concerned with infinite primitive sets. Any infinite subset $S$ of $\mathbb{N}$ can of course be uniquely ordered as a strictly increasing sequence $(a_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ , and infinite sequences can be compared using the lexicographic order . In this way, we can define a partial order on infinite subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ . In particular, we can consider this to be a partial order on the set of infinite primitive sets. My question is: is the set of primes a least element in this partial order? It seems to me that you can argue that this is true by induction.

The series does seem to be numerically correct, as it slowly converges to the desired value. Any help is appreciated.",\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{n+1}H_n}{2n+1} H_n n \frac{\pi\ln(2)}{2}-C C,"['calculus', 'sequences-and-series', 'taylor-expansion', 'harmonic-numbers', 'catalans-constant']"
94,$f \in L^p \iff$ a certain series converges,a certain series converges,f \in L^p \iff,"Let $E_n = \{x \in \mathbb{X} \mid (n-1) \leq |f(x)| < n\}$ , where $(\mathbb{X}, \mathcal{A}, \mu)$ is a finite measure space (i.e., $\mu(\mathbb{X}) < \infty$ ) and $f$ is a measurable function. Prove that $f \in L^p \iff \sum n^p \mu(E_n) < \infty$ . One of the implications is very straightforward to me. It is clear that $\mathbb{X} = \bigcup E_n$ , where the union is disjoint. Therefore, we have: $$\int_\mathbb{X} |f|^p d\mu = \sum_{n=1}^\infty\int_{E_n} |f|^p d\mu$$ By the definition of the sets, we get the inequalities: $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \int (n-1)^p \mathbb{1}_{E_n} d\mu \leq \sum_{n=1}^\infty\int_{E_n} |f|^p d\mu < \sum_{n=1}^\infty \int n^p \mathbb{1}_{E_n} d\mu$$ These, in turn, simplify to $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty (n-1)^p \mu(E_n) \leq \int_{\mathbb{X}} |f|^p d\mu < \sum_{n=1}^\infty  n^p \mu(E_n)$$ Thus, it is immediately apparent that, if the sum converges, then so does the integral, which implies $f \in L^p$ . My problem is in the other implication: $f \in L^p$ implies convergence I haven't used finite measure yet, so maybe it comes to play. I first thought about expanding $(n-1)^p$ , but this would be a mess even if $p$ was an integer (unless in the case where $p = 1$ , in which finite measure would imply the result easily). Does anyone have a hint as per how to proceed? Thanks in advance!","Let , where is a finite measure space (i.e., ) and is a measurable function. Prove that .
