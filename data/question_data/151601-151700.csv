(a) $F$ is a diffeomorphism. (b) $0\notin h(\mathbb{R})$. If $f,g,h$ are $C^1$ functions, then $F$ is a $C^1$ function and thus we can use the following fact.

Another way of seeing this integral is equal to $0$ is to observe that since $1$ is outside the circle $-\gamma$, we have that $n(-\gamma, 1) = 0$ by Cauchy's Theorem in a disk (i.e., $-\gamma$ is a closed curve inside an open disk of radius greater than $1/2$ s.t. $f(z)$ is completely analytic on this disk; hence $\int_{-\gamma} {dz \over 1 - z} = 0$ so that the integral above must also equal $0$). Part (b) attempt: Now if we assume that $\gamma$ is centered at $1$ with radius $1/2$, then we have that $n(-\gamma,1) = 1$ so that $-n(\gamma,1) = -1$.  This makes me suspect our integral in question isn't equal to zero.

48,A query about countability,A query about countability,,"Suppose we are working in an elementary  context where we want to keep background assumptions modest (not take a stand on fancy issues in set theory, say). What should our attitude be to the idea of countability? Countability is defined by a quantification – $X$ are countable if there is a function $f \colon N \to X$ which enumerates them. But quantification over which functions? Even if you fully buy into a rich set-theoretic background, taken at face value, different set theories will supply different enumerating functions. Thus the so-called constructible reals are uncountable according to the theory ‘ZFC + V = L’ but countable according to the theory ‘ZFC + there exists a Ramsey cardinal’. More needs to be said even by the orthodox who identify functions with sets, if it isn’t to be left somewhat indeterminate what objects are countable.  But suppose we fall short of  endorsing the set-thereotic orthodoxy because we don’t (in the context, anyway) want definitely to buy into the wildly infinitary assumptions of this or that set theory: then that leaves more indeterminacy in what counts as countable. (If we don't settle just which functions we are prepared to countenance, we leave it correspondingly open which enumerating functions we are aiming to quantify over when we say that some given objects are countable.) Yet mathematicians — at least when writing in fairly elementary contexts — cheerfully talk about the countable as if that’s unproblematic. How come? Is that just carelessness?? Or worse??? Well, elementary talk about the countable tends (doesn’t it?) to feature  in three sorts of context: There are claims that certain objects are indeed countable, defended by showing that the objects in question are unproblematically counted by producing a nice enumerating function. (Consider, for a familiar simple example, how we show that the positive rationals $m/n$ are countable by actually constructing the ‘zig-zag’ enumerating function for ordered pairs $m, n$, and so counting them.) There are claims that certain objects are uncountable, defended by reducing the assumption that they can be counted to absurdity. (Consider, for another familiar simple example, the usual diagonal argument that the infinite binary sequences are uncountable.) There are conditional claims of the kind if X are countable, then ... , supported by general arguments that are insensitive to how exactly we delimit (or fail to delimit) the countable. (The second is a special case of the third, of course, but perhaps worth highlighting separately.) In none of these kinds of case, at any rate, does such indeterminacy as we might be leaving in the extent of the countable become problematic. So if we proceed with due caution – restrict ourselves to these cases — we can continue to talk about the (un)countable safely enough. And in elementary contexts we do exercise such caution. So we are not in trouble after all. Or at least, so it seems. Query: is that a fair description of ‘ordinary’ mathematical practice in elementary, non-set-theoretic, areas?

83,Integration of hyperreal functions / Intermediate Value Theorem,Integration of hyperreal functions / Intermediate Value Theorem,,"Here's a statement on hyperreal function I've been trying to prove (I came up with it but I think it is true): Suppose $f(x)$ is a continuous real-valued function and $h(x)$ is a continuous hyperreal-valued function such that $f(x) \approx h(x)$ for all $x$ (even infinite). If $\int_a^\infty f(x)\,dx$ and $\int_a^\infty h(x)\,dx$ exist and are finite, then $ \int_a^\infty f(x)\,dx = \int_a^\infty h(x)\,dx$ . Note: $\int_a^\infty g(x)\,dx = st\left(\sum_a^Ng(x)\,dx\right)$ for any infinite $N$ . Using notions of standard analysis, I can show that $\int_a^b f(x)\,dx - \int_a^b h(x)\,dx=0$ for all real $b$ and therefore remains $0$ as $b$ grows. However, I am unable to use nonstandard analysis on this, that is, to show $\sum_a^N f(x)\,dx \approx \sum_a^N h(x)\,dx$ for all positive infinite $N$ . Just because the statement holds for all real $b$ , I can't see why it must hold for infinite hyperreals and so I feel like my proof is not rigorous enough. The transfer principle will not apply since $h(x)$ does not have to be a natural extension of any real-valued function. Even more, the statement implies that if $h(x) \approx 0$ and $\sum_0^N h(x)\,dx \approx \sum_0^{M} h(x)\,dx \approx  r \in \mathbb{R}$ for all $N,M$ , then $r= 0$ . So we can't have a sort of infinite series of infinitesimals that equals $1$ . This seems surprising to me.

99,calculating a multivariate integral via level sets,calculating a multivariate integral via level sets,,"I'm considering the possibility of calculating an integral of the form $\int_{S_n} f(x_1,\dots,x_n) dx_1\dots dx_n$ via level sets, where $S_n$ is the domain of integration. In my problem everything is real valued, and $f:R^n\to R$. Also, consider $f$ smooth, with no holes, etc. Now, consider $g$ a real number that solves the equation $g=f(x_1,\dots,x_n)$, i.e., a level set. Then, I think one can write the relation \begin{equation} \int_{S_n}f(x_1,\dots,x_n) dx_1\dots dx_n=\int g\rho(g)dg \end{equation} where $\rho(g)dg$ is the density distribution of $g$, or roughly speaking the number of solutions of the level set equation for $g$. A simple example: consider calculating the volume of a half sphere (radius $r$) centered at $(a,a,0)$. Then, the integral on the left hand of the identity is $\int dx \int dy \sqrt{r^2-(x-a)^2-(y-a)^2}$, and the right hand is $\int dz 2\pi\sqrt{r^2-z^2}z$ where $g=z$ and $\rho(g=z)=2\pi\sqrt{r^2-z^2}$. First, is this statement roughly correct? I suspect it's related to the coarea formula, but am not entirely sure as this is not my area of expertise. Does this result have a particular name? Also, it seems to me that $\rho(g)$ would relate to the Jacobian (modulus) in some way, although I don't think it's just equal. Any ideas? Finally, even if all of this is correct, in a concrete case it seems to me that unless $f$ is a very simple example, it is going to be difficult to make concrete calculations in most cases. However, I should still whether there are some techniques out there to deal with this analytically. Or should one consider numerical techniques?
