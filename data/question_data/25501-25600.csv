0,Exponential growth of a cow farm with constraints in Minecraft,Exponential growth of a cow farm with constraints in Minecraft,,"This question is distinct from Exponential growth of cow populations in Minecraft in that an important constraint present in Minecraft is missing from that post. Here are the following constraints: We start with $2$ adult cows, and $0$ baby cows. Any given pair of adult cows can only be bred to form $1$ baby cow every $5$ minutes. ( not included in the other post ) A baby cow becomes an adult after $20$ minutes. My first (failed) attempt at solving this was to intialise the following functions $A(0)=2, B(0)=0$ , where $A$ and $B$ are funtions of $t$ (time, in minutes) representing the number of Adult and Baby cows respectively. Naively, I represented this via a system of two linear differential equations given the above initial conditions: $$\frac{dA}{dt}=\frac{B}{20}$$ $$\frac{dB}{dt}=\frac{A}{5}$$ Where my thought process was that every 20 minutes there would be an addition of $B$ adults, and every 5 minutes there would be an addition of $\frac{A}{2}$ baby cows. By use of linear algebra, it can be shown that the equations of $A$ and $B$ are as follows: $$A(t)=e^{-\frac{t}{10\sqrt{2}}}+e^{\frac{t}{10\sqrt{2}}}$$ $$B(t)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}e^{\frac{-t}{10\sqrt{2}}}\left(e^{\frac{t}{5\sqrt{2}}}-1\right)$$ Where the total number of cows, call this $C(t)$ is some rounded form of $A(t)+B(t)$ . The problem with this: Given that at any given time, the 'age' of the babies within the pool will be different (non-uniform), the formation of adults will be staggered. This is the point I'm struggling to continue. I've tried to think of $B$ as forming subsequences every $5$ minutes, but I am really unsure how to implement this in any meaningful way. So how can this formula be generated? Edit : On second thoughts, this might be reducible to the post linked at the start. Not too sure though.

As those vectors are normalized this is equivalent to $$v_i\cdot v_j=\begin{cases} 1,& i=j \\m, & i\neq j \end{cases}$$ with $|m|<1$ . So if $V$ is the $n\times (n+1)$ matrix whose columns are formed by the $v_i$ we have $$M:=V^TV=\begin{pmatrix}1 & m & \cdots &m \\m&1&\cdots&m\\ \vdots &&\ddots&\vdots \\ m&m&\cdots&1 \end{pmatrix}$$ $M$ is a $(n+1)\times (n+1)$ matrix and must be singular (as it is the product of two rank $n$ matrices).

I'd like to understand this question, but I've never seen anything like this, so I don't even know what key words to research or where to look for more information. I'm not necessarily looking for an answer to the following question. Rather, in years past, exams have routinely featured a question that explores the connection between determinants and polynomials, such as the following question. So any sources with more information about this topic, or any hints about the following problem, would be much appreciated! Question. Consider a continuous function $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow (0, \infty)$ such that $\int_{-\infty}^\infty |x|^j f(x) \ dx < \infty$ for all $j \geq 0$ . Denote by $\mathcal{P}_m$ the vector space of all real-valued polynomials of degree at most $m$ , equipped with the inner product $$\langle g, h \rangle = \int_{-\infty}^\infty g(x)h(x)f(x) \ dx.$$ Let $m_j = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x^j f(x) \ dx \ (j = 0, 1, 2, \dots)$ and consider the polynomials $p_0(x) = m_0$ and \begin{align} p_n(x) = \det \left( \begin{matrix}  m_0 & m_1 & m_2 & \dots & m_n \\ m_1 & m_2 & m_3 & \dots & m_{n+1} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ m_{n-1} & m_n & m_{n+1} & \dots & m_{2n-1} \\ 1 & x & x^2 & \dots & x^n  \end{matrix} \right) \ \ \ \ n = 1, 2, \dots \end{align} Prove that $p_0, \dots, p_m$ are orthogonal in $\mathcal{P}_m$ . Observations. I have been able to ascertain the following intuition: Any (nonzero) polynomial cannot be integrated from $-\infty$ to $\infty$ , so for polynomials $g, h \in \mathcal{P}_m$ , their product will certainly fail to have an integral. Therefore, the function $f$ is introduced. The function $f$ must have tails that go to zero fast enough so that not only can $f$ can be integrated across all of $\mathbb{R}$ , but also $f$ modulates the end behavior of the term $x^j$ so that it can be integrated. Then, the product of $f$ and $g$ will be a polynomial, the integral of a polynomial can be split across the terms, the coefficients pulled out of the integrals, and the result will be of the form $\sum_{j=1}^{2m} a_j \int_{-\infty}^\infty x^j f(x) \ dx = \sum_{j=1}^{2m} a_j m_j$ , where $a_j$ is some constant and $m_j$ is defined as per the problem. Lastly, I have checked a couple of lower order polynomials and confirmed that their inner product is zero. The computations have felt a little like the kind of index-tracking exercises that I've done during my limited exposure to multilinear algebra. So I am thinking that maybe with more powerful tools for tracking indices, I can prove the desired result. Or maybe it is an induction on $m$ . Or maybe it has something to do with somehow forcing a determinant to have linearly dependent rows. If you have read this far, bless your heart!","The following question was on my qualifying exam.

Finally, let $T\colon V\to V$ be an intertwining map, that is, a linear map such that $T(gv)=g T(v)$ for all $v\in V$ and $g\in G$ . By the theorem of Maschke , there are irreducible $G$ -modules $V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_n$ such that $$ V=V_1\oplus V_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus V_n.$$ Question . Is it true that $$T v_j=\lambda_j v_j, \qquad \forall v_j\in V_j,$$ for some $\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_n\in\mathbb C$ ? The lemma of Schur says that this is the case provided that $$\tag{*}T(V_j)\subset V_j.$$ This is because, in this case, $T$ restricts to an intertwining self-map of $V_j$ , which is irreducible. Therefore such restriction must be a scalar multiple of the identity. But is it true that (*) always holds with the given assumptions? EDIT . This question arises from the following observations. Suppose that $G$ is finite and abelian, and let $L^2(G)$ denote the space of all complex-valued functions on $G$ , which is a $G$ -module with the representation $gf(x):=f(x-g)$ . (This seemingly complicated notation hints at more general cases, with infinite groups). Let $\chi\in L^2(G)$ denote a character, that is, a homomorphism of $G$ into $\mathbb C^\times$ . Then an intertwining map $T\colon L^2(G)\to L^2(G)$ satisfies $$T\chi=\lambda_\chi \chi, $$ as it is easy to prove. And since the irreps are in this case the 1-dimensional subspaces $$ \operatorname*{span}(\chi), $$ it follows that intertwining maps of the $G$ -module $L^2(G)$ are diagonalized by irreps. (As the accepted answer clearly shows, intertwining maps of other $G$ -modules need not be even diagonalizable! This is the reason why I found that answer surprising and enlightening). Let us consider an infinite and non-abelian case. Suppose that $T\colon L^2(\mathbb S^{d-1})\to L^2(\mathbb S^{d-1})$ is rotation-invariant; $$ (Tf)(R^{-1}x)=T(f(R^{-1}\cdot))(x).$$ Then $T$ is diagonalized by spherical harmonics.

Thanks for any advice.","Consider the Hilbert space $L^2 (1,\infty)$ and a real function $g(x)=x^2$ defined on the interval $(1,\infty)$. Define an operator $T$ by the formula $T(f)=f \cdot g$ for all $f$ in the domain $$D(T)=\{ f \in L^2 (1,\infty); \space  \space f \cdot g \in L^2 (1,\infty), \space \int_1^{\infty}f(x)\mathrm{d}x=0\}.$$ I'm trying to find the adjoint operator $T^*$, i.e. the operator defined on the set $$D(T^*)=\{h \in L^2 (1,\infty); \space  \space  \mathrm{the \space mapping \space} f \mapsto \langle Tf,h \rangle \mathrm{\space is \space continuous \space on \space} D(T)\}$$ such that $\langle Tf,h \rangle = \langle f,T^* h \rangle$ for every $f \in D(T), \space h \in D(T^*)$. I managed to prove that the operator $T$ is densely defined (therefore $T^*$ is well-defined and uniquely determined) and closed (i.e. it has a closed graph). Unfortunately, I'm unable to find a nice characterisation of the set $D(T^*)$. My approach is following: Suppose that $h \in D(T^*)$. Then there exists a uniquely determined (thanks to the density of the domain) function $\Psi \in L^2 (1,\infty)$ such that $\langle  Tf,h \rangle = \langle f,\Psi \rangle$ for all $f \in D(T)$. Using the definition of the inner product on $L^2 (1,\infty)$ we find out that for all $f \in D(T)$ $$\int_1^{\infty}f \cdot \left( \bar{h} \cdot g \space - \space \bar{\Psi}  \right )=0.$$ But now I'm stuck because I can't guarantee that the function $\bar{h} \cdot g$ is in $L^2(1,\infty)$.
