1,Spherical Harmonics expansion,Spherical Harmonics expansion,,"In the contex of $L^2$ space, it is usually stated that any square-integrable function can be expanded as a linear combination of Spherical Harmonics: $$ f(\theta,\varphi)=\sum_{\ell=0}^\infty \sum_{m=-\ell}^\ell f_\ell^m \, Y_\ell^m(\theta,\varphi)\tag 2 $$ where $Y_\ell^m( \theta , \varphi )$ are the Laplace spherical harmonics. The context here is important because this equality holds only in the sense of the $L^2$ -norm. This expansion holds in the sense of mean-square convergence — convergence in [[Lp space|L 2 ]] of the sphere — which is to say that $$\lim_{N\to\infty} \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^\pi \left|f(\theta,\varphi)-\sum_{\ell=0}^N \sum_{m=- \ell}^\ell f_\ell^m Y_\ell^m(\theta,\varphi)\right|^2\sin\theta\, d\theta \,d\varphi = 0.$$ So in general this limit is NOT pointwise? So I can't say that the value at a point of the function equals the value of the expansion at the same point?

I mean in some context outside the Hilbert space, where I am not interested in their square integral. Furthermore, if it's not pointwise, but only in the norm, am I allowed to sum term by term two different functions, with two different expansions, like in the quantum scattering problem?","In the contex of space, it is usually stated that any square-integrable function can be expanded as a linear combination of Spherical Harmonics: where are the Laplace spherical harmonics.

In summary, AP works fine for $f$ , $g$ , and $h_0$ but does not for $h_1$ and $h_2$ . This led me to the question in the heading. But let us start from the beginning. Quoting $[3]$ : ""In mathematics, the Abel-Plana formula (AP) is a summation formula discovered independently by Niels Henrik Abel (1823) and Giovanni Antonio Amedeo Plana (1820). It states that $$\sum _{n=0}^{\infty } f(n)=\frac{1}{2}f(0)+\int_0^{\infty } f(x) \, dx+i \int_0^{\infty } \frac{f(i y)-f(-i y)}{e^{2 \pi  y}-1} \, dy\tag{1}$$ It holds for functions f that are holomorphic in the region Re(z) >= 0, and satisfy a suitable growth condition in this region; for example it is enough to assume that |f| is bounded by $C/|z|^{1+\epsilon}$ in this region for some constants C, $\epsilon > 0$ , though the formula also holds under much weaker bounds."" Ok, the growth condition for applicability of AP, $$|f(z)| < C / |z|^{1+\epsilon}\text{, with } C>0, \epsilon >0\tag{2}$$ is fulfilled for $f$ and $g$ above, and is violated by the $h$ -sums because $\sin(z)$ is not limited in the complex plane. I have obtained the following results: AP works for $f$ , $g$ , and $h_0$ and doesn't for the remaining $h_{1,2}$ . The surprising case is $h_0$ where the growth condition $(2)$ not met but AP still gives the correct result. Examples Example $g$ . -> sucess The sum has a closed form $$g = \frac{1}{2} (\pi  \coth (\pi )-1)\simeq 1.0766740474685811741$$ Now we to AP: Here $f(n)=\frac{1}{1+(n+1)^2}$ to let the index start at $n=0$ . $f(z)$ is meromorhpic (it has two simple poles at $-1+\pm i$ ) and it goes to zero like $1/|z|^2 for $ |z|\to\infty $ so that condition $ (2)$ is fulfilled. We write the r.h.s. of $(1)$ as a sum of three parts, a, b, and c, and calculate $$a = \frac{1}{2}f(0)= \frac{1}{2}= 0.5$$ $$b = \int_0^{\infty } f(x) \, dx=\frac{\pi}{4}\simeq 0.785398$$ the integrand of the last integral is $$c_i = i \frac{f(i y)-f(-i y)}{e^{2 \pi  y}-1} = \frac{i (f(i y)-f(-i y))}{e^{2 \pi  y}-1}= \frac{4 y}{\left(e^{2 \pi  y}-1\right) \left(y^4+4\right)}$$ hence the integral is $$c = \int_0^\infty \frac{4 y}{\left(e^{2 \pi  y}-1\right) \left(y^4+4\right)}$$ The integral is convergent and the numerical value is $$c_n = 0.041275695056277776209$$ Hence $a+b+c$ is equivalent to the closed expression for $g$ . Success! Example $h_0$ -> success $$f(n) = \frac{\sin(n+1)}{n+1}$$ The sum has the closed form $$\frac{1}{2} (\pi -1)\simeq 1.0707963267948966192$$ Condition $(2)$ is not fulfilled because for complex $z$ we have $f(z) \sim \sinh(|z|)$ . Let us nevertheless apply AP. $$a = \frac{1}{2}f(0)=\frac{\sin (1)}{2}\simeq 0.420735$$ $$b = \int_0^{\infty } f(x) \, dx=\frac{1}{2} (\pi -2 \text{Si}(1))\simeq 0.624713$$ $$c_i = i \frac{f(i y)-f(-i y)}{e^{2 \pi  y}-1} = \frac{2 (y \sin (1) \cosh (y)-\cos (1) \sinh (y))}{\left(e^{2 \pi  y}-1\right) \left(y^2+1\right)}$$ $$c = \int_0^\infty \frac{2 (y \sin (1) \cosh (y)-\cos (1) \sinh (y))}{\left(e^{2 \pi  y}-1\right) \left(y^2+1\right)}$$ The integral is convergent and the numerical value is $$c_n = 0.0253475$$ Hence we have $a+b+c \simeq 1.070796$ in good agreement with $h_0$ .  So in spite of violating the growing condition AP gives the correct result. Example $h_1$ -> failure $$f(n) = \frac{\sin((n+1)^2)}{n+1}$$ Numerically we have $$h_1 \simeq 0.167924$$ Condition $(2)$ is not fulfilled because for complex $z$ we have $f(z) \sim \sinh(|z|^2)$ . Let us nevertheless formally apply AP. $$a = \frac{1}{2}f(0)=\frac{\sin (1)}{2}\simeq 0.420735$$ $$b = \int_0^{\infty } f(x) \, dx=\frac{1}{4} (\pi -2 \text{Si}(1))\simeq 0.312357$$ $$c_i = i \frac{f(i y)-f(-i y)}{e^{2 \pi  y}-1} = \frac{\left(-(y+i) \sin \left((y-i)^2\right)-(y-i) \sin \left((y+i)^2\right)\right) (\coth (\pi  y)-1)}{2 \left(y^2+1\right)}$$ $$c = \int_0^\infty c_i \,dy\simeq -0.0304174$$ and we have $a+b+c \simeq 0.758439693815265076542$ whic siginifantly deviates from the value of the sum $h_1$ .

84,Sequence of differentiable functions converging to non-differentiable function,Sequence of differentiable functions converging to non-differentiable function,,"Purely out of interest, I wanted to try and construct a sequence of differentiable functions converging to a non-differentiable function. I began with the first non-differentiable function that sprung to my mind, namely \begin{align} &f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}\\ &f(x)=|x|. \end{align} After some testing I considered the function defined by $$f_\varepsilon(x) = |x|+\frac{\varepsilon}{|x|+\sqrt{\varepsilon}} $$ for some $\varepsilon>0$. Then $\lim\limits_{\varepsilon\to0^+}f_\varepsilon(x)=f(x)$, and $f_\varepsilon(x)$ looks smooth, i.e. differentiable for every $\varepsilon>0$ on the entire domain. Question: How can I prove that $f_\varepsilon$ is differentiable for every $\varepsilon>0$ (or disprove) using the definition of the derivative? If this assertion is true, then I construct the sequence simply by setting $\varepsilon = 1/n$ for $n\in\mathbb{N}$. Attempt: I set up the definition for the derivative \begin{align} \frac{\mathrm{d}f_\varepsilon}{\mathrm{d}x} &= \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{1}{h}\left[\left(|x+h|+\frac{\varepsilon}{|x+h|+\sqrt{\varepsilon}}\right)-\left(|x|+\frac{\varepsilon}{|x|+\sqrt{\varepsilon}}\right)\right]\\ &=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{1}{h}\left[|x+h|-|x|+\frac{\varepsilon}{|x+h|+\sqrt{\varepsilon}}-\frac{\varepsilon}{|x|+\sqrt{\varepsilon}}\right], \end{align} but I could not figure out how to proceed. Sidenotes: An interesting thing I discovered when constructing $f_\varepsilon$, was that almost any small change removes its smoothness, for example \begin{equation} g_\varepsilon(x) = |x|+\frac{2\varepsilon}{|x|+\sqrt{\varepsilon}}\hspace{2cm} h_\varepsilon(x) = |x|+\frac{\varepsilon}{|x|+2\sqrt{\varepsilon}} \end{equation} do both not look smooth at all.
