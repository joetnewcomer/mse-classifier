I am studying the behavior of these two functions, i.e. when is $y^x\cdot x>yx^2$ . After graphing it, I have seen that in some regimes, one is greater than the other but not after a specific point. I can prove that there is a single solution for $y=e$ but I struggle to prove the other fact. Attempt $$y^x\cdot x=yx^2\ \overset{x\ge1}{\rightarrow}\ y^x=yx$$ Fixing $y$ to $k$ (for clarity of the reasoning): $$k^x=kx\ \rightarrow x\ln k=\ln k + \ln x$$ $$(x-1)\ln k = \ln x$$ And this is not further simplificable, so we have to find where a line intersects the logarithm function.

For simplicity, let's say both have a maximum at one, so that $\phi, \psi\in[0,1]$ . However, I can't constrain the behavior of $\phi$ and $\psi$ , so I'd rather think of F as as function $F:[0,1]\times[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}^{+}$ for the purposes of this question. I have assumed that $F$ is bounded and twice differentiable (although I think I must use semi-derivatives at the boundary to make this rigorous, since the interval is closed). At one point in my calculations, the fraction $\frac{1}{\phi}\frac{\partial{F(\phi,\psi)}}{\partial\phi}$ appears. The problem is I that know $\phi$ and $\psi$ have a zero, so I'd like to ensure, under as few assumptions as possible, that this won't diverge when $\phi$ approaches zero from the right.

I thought about assuming the second derivatives $\frac{\partial{^2F(\phi,\psi)}}{\partial\phi^2}$ and $\frac{\partial{^2F(\phi,\psi)}}{\partial\phi\partial\chi}$ are bounded (which would make physical sense in this case) to get a Lipschitz condition on the and partial derivatives. Then I could impose $\lim_{\phi\to 0^+}\frac{\partial{F(\phi,\psi)}}{\partial\phi}=0$ or something similar to make the derivative bounded. But I don't know if there is a version of this argument that makes sense when $\phi=0$ , since the usual derivative is not defined there. So, could someone help me find some simple (as in not too restrictive) conditions that would make this limit well defined?","I'm working on a class of  models defined by a certain function (there is a lot of freedom in this choice).

Applying Gaussian elimination to the augmented matrix , by hand, we have: Applying Applying Applying Continuing in this fashion, we obtain after , By back-substitution, Substituting the value of in , we have: As the recurrence relationship stays the same for , we have: Now, the Hessian of , is the same tridiagonal matrix as above. If we find the sequence of determinants , where is a sub-matrix of in the upper-left corner, we see that . Consequently, the critical point is a global minima.

I know there are probably other ways to solve this problem, but here I am seeking help from others to see where I am going wrong in my solution.

What is the force on the object due to acceleration at point $(\sqrt{2}, 2)$ ? Recall $\vec{F} = m\vec{a}$ . This was an ""applied theory"" problem I got incorrect on an generated exam I recently took. This question seems to be a similar idea, excepting that I need to work backwards from speed rather than velocity and that speed is constant. Here is what I understand: Since we're working in 2-D, $|\vec{v}(t)| = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2} = 5 \implies |\vec{v}(t)|^2 = 25 = v_x^2 + v_y^2$ . I don't know if this helps me. The parabola can be reparameterized as a trajectory/displacement curve: $\vec{r}(t) = \langle t, t^2 \rangle$ From the reparameterization, we can differentiate $\frac{d \vec{r}}{dt} = \vec{v}(t) = \langle 1, 2t \rangle$ and once more $\frac{d \vec{v}}{dt} = \vec{a}(t) = \langle 0, 2 \rangle$ .

Point ( $3$ ) above would lead one to naively assume that acceleration is $2$ units/sec $^2$ upwards for all times $t$ .

To me this meant $\mathbb{R} - B = \{x: x \neq 2^{-k}\ \text{and} x \neq 0\}$ . To build off of this idea I drew a picture of the number line with the points belonging to $B$ and observed how the points of $C$ would have to be to satisfy my argument. So after some fiddling around I defined the points of $C$ as follows: $$C = \mathbb{R} - B = \{y: y = x\pm \delta\ \text{depending on which side of an $x$ from $B$ that the point $y$ is in relation to}\}$$ . So how do I choose my $\delta$ ? So keep in mind that each $x \in B$ is actually a function of a particular $k$ , so with this in mind I defined $\delta = \min(|2^{-k}-y|, |2^{-(k+1)}-y|)$ . In this set up it means I'm taking a $\delta$ that will take into consideration the possibility of having an open ball over a value $x \in B$ which we don't want. So with this setup I now need to show $C$ is open. Define a point $z \in C$ as $z = x \pm \frac{\delta}{2}$ . By this definition we see that $z \in B(y, \delta)$ . It's here where I'm having trouble completing the proof. So to show the ball is open is dependent on where my $y$ value is, so for a concrete argument let's suppose that $y < 2^{-k}$ . To show $B(y, \delta) \subset C$ means I have to show for all $z \in B(y, \delta)$ that: $$|z - y| < |2^{-k} - y| \\ \Rightarrow\ |z - y| < 2^{-k} - y\ \text{(since assuming $y < 2^{-k}$ case)}$$ I'm having trouble arriving at the conclusion...What I envision happening after some algebra is: $$2^{-(k+1)} < z < 2^{-k}$$ Which would then give me my open ball. So I have two questions: My idea seems to be leading me in the right direction, but needs some fine-tuning. What do I need to do to tighten it up? With regards to the other way of showing closed. In this set it seems like the only sequence is the set itself since the $x = 2^{-k}$ and that will converge to $0$ , but can I actually say that this is true? Couldn't there be some rare sequences that I have not found that are in the set, but since I have not explicitly stated all convergent sequences then I can't use the definition of closed explicitly?","This question comes from Shifrin's  Multivariable Mathermatics - Sec 2.2 - 1(b) , it asks: Show that the set is open, closed, or neither and prove your answer. I've come to the conclusion that the set is closed and I wanted some assistance on tightening up my solution. Solution The tools I have up to this point to show that a set is closed are: i) show all convergent sequences in the set converge to a point in the set. ii) Show that the complement of the set is open. I chose to approach this problem using (ii), but I do have a question about how I could use (i) I'll ask at the end. So first I have to figure out what it means to be in . To me this meant .
