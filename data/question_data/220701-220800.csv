1,How to make sense of the inverse image of a Weil divisor?,How to make sense of the inverse image of a Weil divisor?,,"I was reading Hartshorne's proof that $Cl(X \times \mathbb A^n)=Cl(X)$.

I am not sure I understand what $p^{-1}(D)$ means. Is it just the scheme theoretic inverse of $D$ ie $D \times_X (X \times_k A^n)$? would that be the same as $D \times_k A^n$ as intuition would suggest?

9,Checking if a System of Polynomial Equations is Consistent,Checking if a System of Polynomial Equations is Consistent,,"I'm trying to determine whether any solutions exist to a system of $(n+1)$ polynomial equations in $n$ unknowns. For example: $$ \begin{align*} xy&=-2\\ x^2-1&=0\\ y^3-3y^2+2y&=0 \end{align*} $$ This is an accurate simplification of my actual system in that the first equation contains mixed terms with all variables represented and the remaining $n$ equations are univariate, and that the maximum degree of any term (say, $D$) is in the low single digits. The actual system is very large ($n$ is $10^3$ to $10^4$), but with similar $D$. It also typically has many terms in the first equation. In this example, the system is in fact consistent ($x=-1; y=2$). Were the first equation altered, however, to $xy=-3$, the system would be inconsistent. My naive approach is to find the solutions to the last $n$ equations (here $x\in\{-1,1\},y\in\{0,1,2\}$) and try all combinations thereof until one satisfies the first equation or I exhaust the combinations, but this requires roughly $D^n$ checks, which isn't feasible for large systems. It's also not necessary to find a solution, just prove whether one exists. I've spent some time looking for appropriate algorithms, and I'll summarise my current understanding.  I don't have a very strong background in this kind of math, so please correct any misconceptions I have here. As per Wikipedia, consistency can be checked via computation of the Grobner basis. It seems like I would need to know a priori the order $y>x$ to compute the basis, which I do not. Also, one of the papers I read on the topic seems to indicate that this method gets exponentially slower with increasing $n$. There is a numerical method called `homotopy continuation' for finding solutions given a similar set of equations with known solutions, but since the number of solutions is unknown (which is the point after all) I couldn't see how/if I could apply it.  It involves varying a parameter $t$ from 0 to 1 and formulating the equations such that at $t=0$ you recover the known case and at $t=1$ you recover the desired case, using Newton's method.  My attempt failed because it is possible that no solutions exist for some intermediate $t$ even though the system is consistent at both $t=0$ and $t=1$. It is possible to state the equations as rational functions in a single variable using a technique called `rational univariate representation'.  I don't properly understand how to get this representation of the system other than by trial and error, although I do understand how it would allow me to determine the consistency of the system if I did find it. I believe that due to the form of the system, I won't ever have infinite solutions, but I may have more than one. I can accept having to use methods that are exponential in $D$ due to it never getting large, but not in $n$. If a suitable algorithm to check consistency relies upon the assumption of integer solutions, I would consider that an acceptable drawback.

My attempt (following the proof of Proposition V.3.4 in Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometry): let $\mathcal F^i := R^i f_* \mathcal O_{\widetilde X}$ and let $y$ be the generic point of $Y$ .

Edit: Maybe the above reasoning is wrong, but at least I'd like to know which are the exceptional curves (coming from blow-ups) that are not contracted by $f$ (if there is any). I'm sure that I've read somewhere the following thing: The exceptional curve of the last blow-up can't be contracted by   $f$.

67,Determine the cocycle condition in Galois descent induced by faithfully flat descent,Determine the cocycle condition in Galois descent induced by faithfully flat descent,,"I initially asked this question on  Mathoverflow as I thought it was to right place to do so. But it might not be so I will copy it here instead. I apologize for double posting and I will gladly erase the inapropriate one. It's the first time that I use these forums so I'm not sure if it is the right amount of details. I tried to give a proof that fppf (faithfully flat) descent implies Galois descent purely at the level of modules and I stumble to obtain the Galois cocycle condition. I'm interested to consider some questions of twisted sheaves with a Galois cohomological description and understanding how to obtain the former would be useful to me. I obtained the following the following conditions: Given a finite Galois extension $L/K$ of Galois group $G$ and $M$ an $L$ -vector space $M$ , we have for each $\sigma \in G$ an isomorphism of $L$ -vector spaces $\psi_\sigma : M \to M^\sigma$ satisfying $\psi_\sigma(am) = \sigma(a) \psi_\sigma(m)$ , where $a \in L$ and $m \in M$ and such that for every pair $(\sigma, \tau) \in G \times G$ we have $$ \psi_{ ( \sigma, \tau), (\sigma, \tau), \sigma } \circ \psi_{ ( \sigma, \tau), (\sigma, \tau), \tau } = \psi_{ ( \sigma, \tau), (\sigma, \tau), \sigma \tau } $$ as isomorphisms of $L$ -modules. The $L$ -module structure of $M^\sigma$ is twisted by $\sigma$ , i.e given by $a \cdot m:= \sigma(a)m$ . My issue is that because of what one obtains for sheaves of modules ( https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0CDQ ) I would expect the cocycle condition for modules to also have a twisting in the formula. Translating what is done in stacks project into modules is certainly possible but I wasn't able to do so. Edit: If someone can give me the details of how it is done at the level of modules (or a least some clear sketch), I would accept this as a correct answer. Instead I will present a (somehow long) sketch  of what I did. I can provide more details upon request and I apologize if there are too many. My difficulty is on Step 5 . You can skip directly to this step if you want, the rest explains how I got there. The context : Let $L/K$ be a finite Galois extension and let $M$ be an $L$ -module together we an isomorphism of $L \otimes_K L$ -modules $\phi: M \otimes_K L \to L \otimes_K M$ satisfying the cocyle condition $p_{13}^* \phi = p_{23}^* \phi \circ p_{12}^* \phi$ as isomorphisms of $L \otimes_K L \otimes_K L$ -modules. What I did : Step 1: Describing some isomorphisms We have an isomorphism of $K$ -algebras $L \otimes_K L \to \prod_{\sigma \in G} L$ given by $a \otimes 1 \mapsto ( a )_{\sigma \in G}$ and $1 \otimes a \mapsto ( \sigma(a) )_{\sigma \in G}$ and another one $ L \otimes_K L \otimes_K L \to \prod_{\sigma \in G} \Big( \prod_{\tau \in G} L \Big)$ given by $$ a \otimes 1 \otimes 1 \mapsto \Big( (a)_{\tau \in G} \Big)_{\sigma \in G}, $$ $$ 1 \otimes a \otimes 1 \mapsto \Big( (\tau(a)_{\tau \in G} \Big)_{\sigma \in G}, $$ $$ 1 \otimes 1 \otimes a \mapsto \Big( \tau\sigma(a)_{\tau \in G} \Big)_{\sigma \in G}. $$ We can then describe the above isomorphisms as $$ (1_L \coprod \sigma) : L \otimes_K L \to \prod_{\sigma \in G} L $$ and $$ (1_L \coprod \tau \coprod \tau \sigma): L \otimes_K L \otimes_K L \to \prod_{\sigma \in G} \Big( \prod_{\tau \in G} L \Big). $$ Step 2: Obtain some $\prod_{\sigma \in G} L$ -module structures We then have a commutative diagram of modules. $$ \begin{array}{ccccc}  M  \otimes_K L & \xrightarrow{} &  \prod_{\sigma \in G} \Big( M \otimes_K L \Big) & \xrightarrow{} & \prod_{\sigma \in G} M\\ \downarrow & & \downarrow & & \downarrow \\  L  \otimes_K M & \xrightarrow{} & \prod_{\sigma \in G} \Big( L\otimes_K M  \Big) & \xrightarrow{} &  \prod_{\sigma \in G} M^\sigma  \end{array} $$ where the left most vertical arrow is $\phi$ and we denote by $\psi$ the induced the right most vertical arrow. Using Step 1 we have ring morphisms $L \xrightarrow{1_L} L$ and $L \xrightarrow{\sigma} L$ for each $\sigma \in G$ . Tensoring $M$ with these morphisms give $L$ -module structures for $M \otimes_K L$ by $a \cdot ( m \otimes c ) = m \otimes ac$ and for $L \otimes_{L,\sigma} M$ by $a \cdot (c \otimes m) = \sigma(a)c \otimes m$ . Now the isomorphism of $L$ -modules $\mu: M \otimes_L L \to M: m \otimes c \mapsto cm$ then gives to $M$ the $L$ -module structure $a \otimes m = am$ . We also have the composite diagram $$ L \otimes_{L,\sigma} M \xrightarrow{ \sigma^{-1} \otimes 1_M } L \otimes_L M \xrightarrow{\mu'} M : c \otimes m \mapsto \sigma^{-1}(c) \otimes m \mapsto \sigma^{-1}(c)m. $$ Then this $M$ has $L$ -module structure given by $a \cdot m := \sigma(a)m$ and we denote it by $M^\sigma$ (We can relabel to get $M^\sigma$ instead of $M^{\sigma^{-1}}$ .). Now a structure of $\prod_{\sigma \in G} L$ -module on $\prod_{\sigma \in G} M$ (resp. on $\prod_{\sigma \in G} M^\sigma$ ) is determined by an $L$ -module structure on $M$ (resp. on $M^\sigma$ ) for each $\sigma \in G$ . Therefore, if $(a_\sigma)_{\sigma \in G} \in \prod_{\sigma \in G}$ and $(m_\sigma)_{\sigma \in G} \in \prod_{\sigma \in G} M$ (resp. in $\prod_{\sigma \in G} M^\sigma$ ), then $$ (a_\sigma)_{\sigma \in G} \bullet (m_\sigma)_{\sigma \in G} = (~a_\sigma m_\sigma)_{\sigma \in G} ( \text{ resp. } (a_\sigma)_{\sigma \in G} \circ (m_\sigma)_{\sigma \in G} = ( \sigma(a)_\sigma m_\sigma)_{\sigma \in G}~). $$ Step 3: Determine for each $\sigma \in G$ the isomorphisms of $L$ -modules $\psi_\sigma$ . The isomorphism $\psi$ induced by $\phi$ must then satisfy $$ \psi \big( a_\sigma m_\sigma)_{\sigma \in G} ) = (a_\sigma)_{\sigma \in G} \circ \psi( ( m_\sigma)_{\sigma \in G} ). $$ For each $\sigma \in G$ we have an isomorphism of $L$ -modules $$ M \xrightarrow{\iota_\sigma} \prod_{\sigma \in G} M \xrightarrow{\psi} \prod_{\sigma \in G} M^\sigma \xrightarrow{\pi_\sigma} M^\sigma $$ given by $$ am \mapsto (0, \cdots, 0, am, 0, \cdots, 0) \mapsto \big( \sigma(a) \pi_\sigma \Big( \psi( \iota_\sigma(m) \Big) \big)_{\sigma \in G} \mapsto \sigma(a)\pi_\sigma \Big( \psi(m) \Big). $$ So for each $\sigma \in G$ we have an isomorphism $\psi_\sigma : M \to M^\sigma$ defined by $\psi_\sigma(m):=\pi_\sigma( \psi(m) )$ and such that $\psi_\sigma(am) = \sigma(a)\psi_\sigma(m)$ . Step 4: Determine some $\prod_{\sigma \in G} \prod_{\tau \in G} L$ -module structures I will skip some details, which I can provide upon request. I use the cocycle condition to determine three $\prod_{\sigma \in G} \prod_{\tau \in G} L$ -module structures. Consider $p_{12}^* p_1^* M$ (or equivalently $p_{13}^*p_1^*M$ ). The $\prod_{(\sigma,\tau) \in G \times G } L$ -module $\prod_{(\sigma,\tau) \in G \times G }  M$ is $$ (a_{g,h}) \cdot ( m_{g,h} ) = ( a_{g,h} m_{g,h} ). $$ Consider $p_{12}^* p_2^* M$ (or equivalently $p_{23}^*p_1^*M$ ). The $\prod_{(\sigma,\tau) \in G \times G } L$ -module $\prod_{(\sigma,\tau) \in G \times G }  M^\tau$ is $$ (a_{\sigma,\tau}) \cdot ( m_{\sigma,\tau} ) = ( \tau(a_{\sigma,\tau}) m_{\sigma,\tau} ). $$ Consider $p_{13}^* p_2^* M$ (or equivalently $p_{23}^*p_2^*M$ ). The $\prod_{(\sigma,\tau) \in G \times G } L$ -module $\prod_{(\sigma,\tau) \in G \times G }  M^{\sigma \tau}$ is $$ (a_{\sigma,\tau}) \cdot ( m_{\sigma,\tau} ) = ( (\sigma \circ \tau)(a_{\sigma,\tau}) m_{\sigma,\tau} ). $$ Step 5: Determine the cocycle condition Finally, for each pair $(\sigma, \tau) \in G \times G$ we have three composite maps given as follows: $$ M_{(\sigma, \tau)} \xrightarrow{ \iota_{(\sigma,\tau)}} \prod_{(\sigma,\tau) \in G \times G} M \xrightarrow{ p_{12}^* \psi } \prod_{(\sigma,\tau) \in G \times G} M^\tau \xrightarrow{ \pi_{\sigma,\tau}} M_{(\sigma, \tau)}^\tau $$ defining an $L$ -module isomorphism $ \psi_{ ( \sigma, \tau), (\sigma, \tau), \tau } : M_{(\sigma,\tau)} \to M_{(\sigma,\tau)}^\tau$ satisfying $$ \psi_{ ( \sigma, \tau), (\sigma, \tau), \tau }(am) = \tau(a)\psi_{ ( \sigma, \tau), (\sigma, \tau), \tau }(m) $$ $$ M_{(\sigma, \tau)} \xrightarrow{ \iota_{(\sigma,\tau)}} \prod_{(\sigma,\tau) \in G \times G} M \xrightarrow{ p_{13}^* \psi } \prod_{(\sigma,\tau) \in G \times G} M^{\sigma \tau} \xrightarrow{ \pi_{\sigma,\tau}} M_{(\sigma, \tau)}^{\sigma\tau} $$ defining an $L$ -module isomorphism $ \psi_{ ( \sigma, \tau), (\sigma, \tau), \sigma \tau } : M_{(\sigma,\tau)} \to M_{(\sigma,\tau)}^{\sigma \tau}$ satisfying $$ \psi_{ ( \sigma, \tau), (\sigma, \tau), \tau }(am) = (\sigma \circ \tau)(a)\psi_{ ( \sigma, \tau), (\sigma, \tau), \tau }(m) $$ and $$ \psi_{ ( \sigma, \tau), (\sigma, \tau), \tau }(am) = \tau(a)\psi_{ ( \sigma, \tau), (\sigma, \tau), \tau }(m) $$ $$ M_{(\sigma, \tau)}^\tau \xrightarrow{ \iota_{(\sigma,\tau)}} \prod_{(\sigma,\tau) \in G \times G} M^\tau \xrightarrow{ p_{23}^* \psi } \prod_{(\sigma,\tau) \in G \times G} M^{\sigma \tau} \xrightarrow{ \pi_{\sigma,\tau}} M_{(\sigma, \tau)}^{\sigma \tau} $$ defining an $L$ -module isomorphism $ \psi_{ ( \sigma, \tau), (\sigma, \tau), \sigma } : M_{(\sigma,\tau)}^\tau \to M_{(\sigma,\tau)}^{\sigma \tau}$ satisfying $$ \psi_{ ( \sigma, \tau), (\sigma, \tau), \sigma }(am) = \sigma(a)\psi_{ ( \sigma, \tau), (\sigma, \tau), \tau }(m). $$ Indeed, $\psi_{ ( \sigma, \tau), (\sigma, \tau), \sigma }$ sends $\tau(a)m$ to $(\sigma \circ \tau)(a)m$ and so sends $am = \tau(\tau^{-1}(a))m$ to $\sigma( am )$ . Since $p_{23}^* \phi \circ p_{12}^*\phi = p_{13}^* \phi$ , we have $p_{23}^* \psi \circ p_{12}^*\psi = p_{13}^* \psi$ and therefore for each pair $(\sigma, \tau) \in G \times G$ we have $$ \psi_{ ( \sigma, \tau), (\sigma, \tau), \sigma } \circ \psi_{ ( \sigma, \tau), (\sigma, \tau), \tau } = \psi_{ ( \sigma, \tau), (\sigma, \tau), \sigma \tau } $$ as isomorphisms of $L$ -modules. Remarks: The map $\psi_{ ( \sigma, \tau), (\sigma, \tau), \sigma }$ is from $M^\tau$ to $M^{\sigma \tau}$ and it is not clear to me how to re-express it as starting from $M$ and twisting it by $\tau$ . Another problem is that the maps I found on Step 3 are not in an obvious way related to those of Step 5 and there might be a need to twick something here as well.","I initially asked this question on  Mathoverflow as I thought it was to right place to do so.

68,How can one translate between scheme-theoretic and complex-analytic Algebraic Geometry?,How can one translate between scheme-theoretic and complex-analytic Algebraic Geometry?,,"The title is too broad. I will narrow it down shortly. My motivation is this. I am interested in complex geometry, and it seems there are (at least) 2 schools having their own notations, methods and so on, to study the same objects: scheme-theoretic (as in R. Hartshorne's ""Algebraic Geometry"") and complex-analytic (as in Griffiths and Harris's book). I understand that each has its own merits, and this is not really the point of my post. I am interested in some possible dictionary to translate results from one language to the other. Already there are differences on the level of topological spaces: schemes make use of the Zariski topology, while complex manifold theory uses the manifold topology. There are also differences between the structure sheaves: schemes, in the context of complex varieties, make use of sheaves that are sheaves of germs of regular rational functions, while in the complex analytic school, one uses the sheaf of germs of holomorphic functions as structure sheaf. Now, I will narrow it down. Consider say Grothendieck's vanishing theorem on one hand, and various vanishing theorems such as the Kodaira-Nakano vanishing theorems and its various generalizations. The conclusions are similar, namely some higher sheaf cohomologies vanish in both cases, but the hypotheses are different: Grothendieck uses Noetherian topological spaces (complex varieties are Noetherian with respect to the Zariski topology, and not the manifold topology), while Kodaira-Nakano use the manifold topology. Maybe my question is naive but: Question 1: can one deduce one of these vanishing theorems from the other? Question 2: are there other examples of theorems which have similar conclusions, but have 2 different versions corresponding to the 2 schools? Question 3: is there a dictionary that allows to translate statements of theorems from one school into the other, so to speak? Question 1 may be too naive, and perhaps false. Question 2 is perhaps not too specific, but interesting, in my opinion. Question 3 would be ultimately what I would like to ""have"", assuming such a dictionary exists. If it exists, it may not be so ""clean cut"" so to speak, because many of the definitions in the scheme-theoretic school were done essentially by algebraists, while those in the complex analytic school were mostly done by geometers and analysts. Edit: concerning question 1), as Bertram pointed out, the 2 vanishing theorems that I chose were quite different in character, so that was a poor choice. Concerning question 3), Bertram kindly referred me to Serre's GAGA paper, which establishes the dictionary I am seeking, and does it with precise results. I kept hearing about this paper as being a masterpiece. Now I have (finally) decided that it was time to read it!","The title is too broad. I will narrow it down shortly. My motivation is this.

For this I consider the homomorphism $\phi$ that maps an equivalence class $[(f, a/f^n)] \mapsto a/f^n$.  (I denote elements of the disjoint union $\sqcup_{f \not\in P} A_f$ by tuples $(f, a/f^n)$.)  Surjectivity is clear, because for any $a/s \in A_P$ with $s \not\in P$, we have the class $[(s, a/s)] \in \varinjlim_{f \not\in P} A_f$ whose image is $a/s$.  For injectivity, suppose we have a class $[(f, a/f^n)]$ whose image $a/f^n = 0/1 \in A_P$.  Then there exists $t \notin P$ such that $ta = 0$.  We want to show that $[(f, a/f^n)]] = [(f, 0/1)]$, which I believe is equivalent to finding a $g \notin P$ such that $V(f) \subseteq V(g)$ and $g^ka = 0$ for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$.  Well, $t$ seems to almost work, but I couldn’t prove that $V(f) \subseteq V(t)$, so maybe we need a different $g$?  Or am I using the wrong map entirely?","For a prime ideal $P$ of a commutative ring $A$, consider the direct limit of the family of localizations $A_f$ indexed by the set $A \setminus P$ with partial order $\le$ such that $f \le g$ iff $V(f) \subseteq V(g)$.
