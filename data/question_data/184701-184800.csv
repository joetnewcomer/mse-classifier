The question states (summarised): A lottery dealer makes 6 cents on each ticket sold. If the lottery dealer sells more than 25,000 tickets, she gets an extra 2 cents for every ticket after the 25,000th ticket. Express her profits as a function of the number of sold tickets. The correct (or expected) answer was the piecewise function: $$ f(x) = \begin{cases} 6x,       & \text{when } 0 \le x \le 25000 \\ 8x-50000, & \text{when } x \gt 25000 \end{cases} $$ However, another answer I saw was: $$ \text{let } x \text{ be the number of tickets sold } \le 25000 \\ \text{let } z \text{ be the number of tickets sold } \gt 25000 \\ f(x) = 6x + 8z $$ I found this answer intuitively incorrect. To me, all mathematical functions are pure (a concept from programming). In particular, all values in a function should not be determined by anything other than it's inputs. In this case, $f(x)$ is defined with an extra $z$ which is not given as an input. But this is a concept from programming, not mathematics. After reading the definition of a function on Wikipedia, I don't see anything that explicitly says that additional variables are allowed or not allowed in function definitions. Is there something I missed in the definition or is the second answer acceptable? EDIT To clarify and amplify the problem, here is another example. Let's say I want to define a function that adds $x$ to the current hour (in 24 hours). For example, $$ \text{let } t \text{ be the current 24 hour time, } 0 \le t \le 23, t \in \mathbb{Z} \\ f(x) = t + x $$ Similar as before, this introduces a variable $t$ that is not given as an input to $f(x)$.

93,Is $f(A)\cap f(B)$ a subset of $f(A\cap B)$?,Is  a subset of ?,f(A)\cap f(B) f(A\cap B),"Let $X$ and $Y$ be sets and let $f\colon X\to Y$ be a function from $X$ to $Y$. If $A$ and $B$ are subsets of $X$, is it true that $f(A)\cap f(B)$ is a subset of $f(A\cap B)$? If so, prove your answer; otherwise, provide a counterexample. If we assume that $f$ is injective, is the above inclusion true? If we assume that $f$ is surjective, is the above inclusion true? If we assume that $f$ is bijective, is the above inclusion true? My thoughts: No, it is not true. Counterexample, consider sets $A = \{1,2\}$ and $B = \{2,3\}$. Let $f\colon A\to B$ where $1$ maps to $4$, $2$ to nothing, and $3$ maps to $4$ and $5$. Then $f(\{1,2\})\cap f(\{2,3\}) = \{4\}\cap\{4,5\} = \{4\}$. However, $f(\{1,2\}\cap\{2,3\}) = f(\{2\}) = \varnothing$. $\{4\}$ is not a subset of the empty set. I think it's true if the function is injective (and also bijective obviously) but not surjective.","Let $X$ and $Y$ be sets and let $f\colon X\to Y$ be a function from $X$ to $Y$.

Wolfram alpha tells me that this function's domain is $x : x>0$, $x \in \mathbb{R}$. I can't see why it cannot be defined for a number like $(-2)$. I mean $(-2)^{-2}=0.25$, the same Wolfram Alpha told me. I realize that fractional powers for negative numbers may cause problems, but it could be defined for integers.
