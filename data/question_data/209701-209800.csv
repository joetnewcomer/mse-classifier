Can anyone verify my solution attempt? Problem A word is a finite sequence of $0$ 's and $1$ 's, and a language is a set of words. Let's say a language $S$ is $0$ - finite when it includes only a finite number of words whose bits are all $0$ 's, that is, when $S\cap 0^*$ is a finite set of words. A language $S$ is boring when either $S$ or $\overline{S}$ is $0$ -finite. (a) Explain why $\left\{00\right\}^*$ is not boring. (b) Verify that, if $R$ and $S$ are boring, then so is $R\cup S$ . (c) Verify that, if $R$ and $S$ are boring, then so is $R\cdot S$ ( Note : $R\cdot S$ is the language consisting of all the words that can be obtained by concatenating a word from $R$ with a word from $S$ ). Hint : By cases: Whether $R$ and $S$ are both $0$ -finite, whether $R$ or $R$ contains no all- $0$ words at all (including the empty word $\lambda$ ), and whether neither of these cases hold. Solution attempt (a) Let $S=\left\{00\right\}^*$ . To show $S$ is not boring, I will show that both $S$ and $\overline{S}$ are not $0$ -finite. $S$ is not $0$ -finite. Proof . By contradiction. If $S$ is $0$ -finite, then there is a longest member in $S$ whose bits are all $0$ s. Call this member $s$ . However, $s' = s00$ is longer than $s$ and $s' \in S$ , which is a contradiction. $\overline{S}$ is not $0$ -finite. Proof . By counter-example. $\overline{S}=\overline{\left\{00\right\}^*}$ is the language of all words that aren't formed by an even number of $0$ 's. For example, the set $R$ of all words formed by an odd number of $0$ 's (that is, $R = \left\{ w\text{ | }w = 0^{2n+1}\right\}$ where $n \geq 0$ ) is a subset of $\overline{S}$ . Since $R$ has infinitely many members, this means that $\overline{S}$ contains an infinite number of all- $0$ words, and therefore $\overline{S}$ is not $0$ -finite. (b) Proof by cases: $R$ and $S$ are both $0$ -finite: The number of all- $0$ words in $R\cup S$ is: (number of all- $0$ words in $R$ ) + (number of all- $0$ words in $S$ ) - the number of all- $0$ words in $R\cap S$ . So, $R\cup S$ is $0$ -finite, and therefore boring. $R$ is $0$ -finite and $\overline{S}$ is $0$ -finite: $\overline{R\cup S} = \overline{R}\cap \overline{S}$ is $0$ -finite, because $\overline{S}$ is $0$ -finite. So, $R\cup S$ is boring. $\overline{R}$ is $0$ -finite and $\overline{S}$ is $0$ -finite: $\overline{R}\cap \overline{S}$ is $0$ -finite, because $\overline{R}$ is $0$ -finite and $\overline{S}$ is $0$ -finite. So, $R\cup S$ is boring. (c) I got stuck in this case. Here is a partial attempt: $R$ and $S$ are both $0$ -finite: The all- $0$ words in $R\cdot S$ are formed by the concatenation of all- $0$ from $R$ with all- $0$ from $S$ . Since the number of all- $0$ words from R and S are finite, the number of all- $0$ words in $R\cdot S$ must also be finite. So, $R\cdot S$ is $0$ -finite, and therefore boring. Either $R$ or $S$ contains no all- $0$ words (including the empty word $\lambda$ ): $R\cdot S$ consists of words $r\cdot s$ where $r\in R$ and $s\in S$ . Without loss of generality, assume $R$ contains no all- $0$ words. Since $r$ is not an all- $0$ word, then $r\cdot s$ can't be an all- $0$ word. So, $R\cdot S$ contains a finite number (zero) of all- $0$ words, and is therefore boring. Neither of the cases above: I got stuck here.

9,How To Solve The Following Counting Problem By Casework,How To Solve The Following Counting Problem By Casework,,"I am trying to solve the following problem by casework: However, my solution 85 is incorrect. The correct solution is 165. I would like to figure 2 things out: why my method is incorrect, and how to actually solve this problem using casework (in other words, how to solve this problem by breaking it into 4 cases: when it has 4 colours, 3 colours, 2 colours and 1 colour). I would appreciate any help on this. Case where there are 4 colours: There are $5C4$ ways to choose 4 colours, and $4!$ ways to arrange these colours. However, because the square can be rotated 4 times, there are $5C4  * 3!$ ways. Case where there are 3 colours: There are $5C3$ ways to choose 4 colours. There are 2 ways to arrange the colours: by placing the two identical colours diagonal to each other, or adjacent to each other. In the first case, there is only unique way to place all the colours. In the second case, there are 2 ways: we can swap the positions of the two unique colours. So we have $5C3  * (2+1)$ ways. Case where there are 2 colours: There are $5C2$ ways to choose 2 colours.

In some elementary texts, I have seen that it is claimed without justification that $A$ and $B$ are independent (often in a context where such a claim is sufficiently obvious to not raise questions, like a dice roll and a coin toss which do not ""affect"" each other), and then the equation in the definition is used to compute $\mathbb{P}(A\cap B)$ by instead computing $\mathbb{P}(A)\cdot \mathbb{P}(B).$ However, it seems to me that before we can claim that $A$ and $B$ are independent, we need to prove that the equation holds, which just might involve computing all three quantities, thus rendering the concept of independence as baggage in this scenario. Questions: Are there implicit ways of proving independence that are applicable in some general scenarios? By implicit, I mean either establishing $\mathbb{P}(A\cap B)=\mathbb{P}(A)\cdot \mathbb{P}(B)$ without computing the three probabilities, or establishing independence without proving this equation. If so, what are they? In these two cases, it would then make sense to me that the equation could be used as a consequence of having proven independence, making the concept of independence useful in that scenario. If the answer is negative (so implicit methods are unknown), then I have to wonder what purpose this abstraction of independence serves in general. Does it maybe facilitate some proofs that are unrelated to independence, such as restricting to independent cases first and then using it to generalize the argument?

Is it based on assumptions?,,"My understanding of the reason for using proof by induction is to see if the expression used to calculate what the nth term in a sequence is, always holds or not. A proof by induction requires a basis step.  It's not explicitly stated why the basis step is important when learning this.  I hear analogies that proof by induction is like a ladder, like dominoes, like stairs, so I think to myself what is similar about those objects.  The segments of a ladder, or stairs all look identical to each other going all the way up the ladder or all the way up the stairs. This leads me to believe there is an assumption that an equation performs an identical action on each of the numbers inputted into it. Which seems reasonable to me. An equation performs the same action on the number 2, whether it be scaling it, adding to it, etc, that it would perform on the next number, say 3. Some expressions are hard to see exactly what the pattern would be, but by looking at the a few terms in the pattern we notice certain pattern, sometimes that pattern does break and we discover the actually equation that would hold that pattern forever is different from what we thought it was originally. So this is where the distinction that we assume the expression we are given originally is correct, in the induction hypothesis we use the logical expression know as implication, ""If p then q""  if you recall the truth table for that expression it can only be proven to be false when p is true and q is false. So the truth of p is actually irrelevant, we are checking to see that if p were true than would q hold. We test the induction hypothesis by setting the original equation on one side of an equals symbol, adding the k+1 last term to it, then we put the expression with the k+1 replacing every instance of k.  We massage the equations to see if they look identical, and if they do we can see our equality holds. I'm not really sure why we bother doing all of this in the first place,  If we are assuming our propositional statement is true to begin with, and if we know from the onset that our equation behaves like a ladder or stairs, can't we just infer from the very beginning that k+1 holds . .

I get that it is reflexive and transitive and not symmetric for the same reasons as #1 but I don't understand why #2 is not antisymmetric but #1 is.

92,How many ways are there to choose 5 groups of 30 workers?,How many ways are there to choose 5 groups of 30 workers?,,"I have 90 workers and I have to do 6 groups so that the total number of workers in the groups is 30. In each group there must be at least one worker. Each group will be assigned a different task. The first thing I have done is to count the ways of choosing 30 workers from a group of 90: $C_{90,30}=\frac{90!}{30!60!}=\frac{90!}{30!60!}$ Now I'm going to calculate the possible ways to make 5 groups with the 30 workers. To each worker I assigned the number 0 and I used the number 1 to delimit each group. So the groups that I have are: $PR_{35}^{30,5}=\frac{35!}{5!30!}$ So the total number of elections are: $\frac{90!}{30!60!}·\frac{35!}{5!30!}$ The problem with this way of calculating it includes the possibility that there are two consecutive ones. This implies that you would have a group with 0 people and by hypothesis it can not be. How do I not include the permutations that have two consecutive ones? EDIT:  I have thought about calculating the number of permutations that has 2 consecutive ones, 3 followed ones, 4 followed ones and the 5 followed ones and applying the Inclusion-exclusion principle. To calculate the permutations with two ones followed I treat them as if they were a single element and I get: $PR_{34}^{30,3,1}$ .  In the same way I calculate the other cases and in the end I obtain that the possible ways of doing 5 groups with 30 people and no empty group are: $PR_{35}^{30,5}-PR_{34}^{30,3,1}+PR_{33}^{30,2,1}-PR_{32}^{30,1,1}+PR_{31}^{30,1}$ Therefore, the solution to the problem is: $C_{90,30}·(PR_{35}^{30,5}-PR_{34}^{30,3,1}+PR_{33}^{30,2,1}-PR_{32}^{30,1,1}+PR_{31}^{30,1})$ Its rigth?","I have 90 workers and I have to do 6 groups so that the total number of workers in the groups is 30.

For example, a coloring where the numbers $2,4$ and $9$ are red is   counted as the same as the coloring where $5,7$ and $2$ are red since   the latter is obtained by adding 3 in mod $10$ . My attempt: So each addition of constant can be thought of rotating the ring $0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9$ once so that $0\rightarrow 1,1\rightarrow 2$ , etc. So if we add the constant $5$ we get $0\rightarrow 5,1\rightarrow 6$ etc. Thus the group of symmetries is $$G=\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}, \quad |G|=10.$$ Now we need to find the fixes of $g$ and compute $$\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}\text{Fix}(g).$$ The identity does nothing, meaning that no matter how we colour these $10$ numbers, they are always fixed, thus there are $2^{10}$ fixes for this symmetry. Adding $1$ changes all the colors of all the spots, the only way our settings are fixed is if we color all the numbers blue or all the numbers red, thus we have two different colorings giving $2^2$ fixes.
