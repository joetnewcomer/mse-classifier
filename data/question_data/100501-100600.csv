1,Two tetrahedra are congruent given a certain condition,Two tetrahedra are congruent given a certain condition,,"This question is inspired by a Miklos Schweitzer problem, namely Problem 9./2007 Let $A$ and $B$ be two triangles in the plane such that the interior of both triangles contains the origin, and for each circle $C_r$ centred at the origin $|C_r \cap A|=|C_r \cap B|$ (where $|\cdot|$ is the arclength measure). Prove that $A,B$ are congruent. Does this statement remain true if the origin lies on the border of $A$ or $B$? This problem can be solved relatively easy proving that the distances from the origin to the edges and the vertices of the two triangles are the same for $A$ and $B$. To do this, consider the circle $C_r$ ""growing"" until it first touches one side of $A$. If it doesn't touch a side of $B$, making $r$ a little bigger, we get a contradiction, since $C_r$ is still inside of $B$, but a part of it is outside $A$ now. Therefore, the distance from $O$ to the nearest side of $A,B$ is the same. Now consider the next side and so on. I was wondering how to apply the same reasoning to the following generalization of the problem: Consider two tetrahedra $A,B$ which both contain the origin in the interior, with the property that for any sphere $S_r$ centred at the origin we have that $|S_r \cap A|=|S_r \cap B|$ (where $|\cdot |$ is the area measure in $\Bbb{R}^3$). Prove that the two tetrahedra are congruent. For the triangle, it is enough to know that the distances from the origin to the sides and vertices are equal to prove that they are congruent. For the tetrahedron I feel I need something more.","This question is inspired by a Miklos Schweitzer problem, namely Problem 9./2007 Let $A$ and $B$ be two triangles in the plane such that the interior of both triangles contains the origin, and for each circle $C_r$ centred at the origin $|C_r \cap A|=|C_r \cap B|$ (where $|\cdot|$ is the arclength measure).

2,Reflect a ray off a circle so it hits another point,Reflect a ray off a circle so it hits another point,,"my problem is the following: I have two points ($e$ and $p$) in a 2D space and I am trying to figure out where on the circle is the reflection of $p$ as seen from $e$. $$$$ $$$$ So the way I approached this is by looking for the vector from the center of the circle to the point, where the ray is reflected.

The two points are represented by the vectors $\color{deeppink}{e}$ and $\color{gold}{p}$] In the picture were looking for the vector $\color{red}{r}$, which coincides with the normal vector of the surface of the circle.

3,Tiling a floor with squares,Tiling a floor with squares,,"I have a rectangular room that has square linoleum tiles.  When the tiles were put in the contractor said that it would take twice as many cuts to have the tiles at a 45 degree angle from the walls than to have them perpendicular to the walls. While the contractor probably just meant it would take a good deal more, and not exactly twice as many cuts I began to think about how many cuts it would take to tile a rectangular room with the two patterns.  To formalize this a bit we will say that all cuts must be straight lines that start and end outside of the tile we are cutting.  We can also reuse the scrap created by cutting tiles (but we can't stitch tiles back together), for example if we need two half tiles we can use a single cut one one tile. There are some rooms that take 0 cuts to be tiled by pattern $a$, in particular rooms with integer side lengths (we are considering the tiles to be $1\times 1$).  These rooms it is clearly a good idea to use Pattern $a$ over Pattern $b$. However if both side lengths of the room (we'll call them $n$ and $m$) are multiples of $\sqrt{2}$ we can tile the room using pattern $b$ making only $\dfrac{n+m}{\sqrt{2}}$ cuts.  (for this we can cut $n+m$ tiles along the diagonals and use the half tiles along the edges).  The best it seems you can get in this situation using pattern $b$ it seems is $\lceil n\rceil+\lceil m\rceil$ (correct me if I'm wrong here).

This is the case when $3$ lines are perpendicular, and the fourth vector is along  one of those $3$ .

Let's index spherical orthants by a binary $n$-tuple, e.g. for $n=4$, $(+,+,-,+)$ is the spherical orthant given by $$x_1 > 0, \qquad x_2 > 0, \qquad x_3 < 0, \qquad x_4 > 0.$$ Now consider the ""upper diagonal halfspace"" given by $$x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n > 0.$$ What is the volume of the intersection of this ""upper diagonal halfspace"" with a spherical orthant, given as a fraction of the volume of that  spherical orthant? $\newcommand{\Vol}{\mathrm{Vol}}$ Let's see some examples. $D_n$ will be the upper diagonal half-space in $\mathbb{R}^n$. $\Vol(O_n)$ will be the volume of a spherical orthant. $$(n= 2)$$ We have: \begin{align*} \frac{\Vol((+,+)\cap D_2)}{\Vol(O_2)}=1 && \frac{\Vol((+,-)\cap D_2)}{\Vol(O_2)}=\frac12 \\ \frac{\Vol((-,+)\cap D_2)}{\Vol(O_2)}=\frac12 && \frac{\Vol((-,-)\cap D_2)}{\Vol(O_2)}=0. \end{align*} $$(n=3)$$ We have: \begin{align*} \frac{\Vol((+,+,+)\cap D_3)}{\Vol(O_3)}={}&1 & \frac{\Vol((+,+,-)\cap D_3)}{\Vol(O_3)}={}&y \simeq 0.78 \\ \frac{\Vol((+,-,+)\cap D_3)}{\Vol(O_3)}={}&y\simeq 0.78  & \frac{\Vol((-,+,+)\cap D_3)}{\Vol(O_3)}={}&y \simeq 0.78 \\ \frac{\Vol((+,-,-)\cap D_3)}{\Vol(O_3)}={}&1-y \simeq 0.22 & \frac{\Vol((-,+,-)\cap D_3)}{\Vol(O_3)}={}&1-y \simeq 0.22 \\ \frac{\Vol((-,-,+)\cap D_3)}{\Vol(O_3)}={}&1 - y \simeq 0.22 & \frac{\Vol((-,-,-)\cap D_3)}{\Vol(O_3)}={}&0, \end{align*} with $y = 2 - \frac4\pi\arccos(\frac{1}{\sqrt3}) \simeq  0.78$. $$(n= 4)$$ We have: \begin{align*} \frac{\Vol((+,+,+,+)\cap D_4)}{\Vol(O_4)}={}&1 & \frac{\Vol((+,+,+,-)\cap D_4)}{\Vol(O_4)}={}&\frac{11}{12} \simeq 0.92\,\, \text{(3 pluses)} \\ \frac{\Vol((+,+,-,-)\cap D_4)}{\Vol(O_4)}={}&\frac12\,\, \text{(2 pluses)} & \frac{\Vol((+,-,-,-)\cap D_4)}{\Vol(O_4)}={}& \frac{1}{12} \simeq 0.08\,\, \text{(1 plus)}\\ \end{align*} $$\frac{\Vol((-,-,-,-)\cap D_4)}{\Vol(O_4)}=0.$$ Can you give the result  for general $n$, and spherical orthants with $k$ times ""+"" ($0\leq k\leq n$) ?

This explains the double arrow. This transform, credited to Magnus and more or less at the same time to Plücker in the early 1830s, is detailed in many books/sites. See Appendix 1 for a comment about inversion properties displayed on Fig. 1. Fig. 1. : Inversion with center $C$ and power 1. Shapes in black are exchanged by inversion with shapes in red. The blue circle, called ""circle of inversion"", is the locus of invariant points. But there are ill-known features that I would like to gather. Moreover, I would like to enlarge this ""quest"" to interesting (not fully standard) questions/applications of inversion. For the initialization of this ""collection"", I propose 3 themes and a compendium of interesting facts: ""Champagne glass inversion"" : Fig. 2 shows how inversion with center $C$ and radius of inversion $k$ (we find back the large and the small fish, inverted images one of the other...) can be realized by a 3 steps $P\Gamma P^{-1}$ operation with respect to a paraboloid $\Pi$ , where: $P$ is the vertical projection from $\Pi$ onto the horizontal plane, and $\Gamma$ is the conical projection from $\Pi$ to $\Pi$ with center $C_0(a,b,a^2+b^2-k^2)$ where $(a,b)$ are the coordinates of $C$ . This non-classical way to describe inversion deserves an explanation that we have placed in Appendix 2. Fig. 2. Inversion by a conical projection $\Pi \to \Pi$ . ""Bubble inversion"" This is a cousin representation of the first one with a sphere instead of a parabola (see Fig. 3). It necessitates to use 2 steps with the two stereographic projections $S_N$ and $S_S$ from the North and South pole resp. with respect to the equatorial plane. Take a look at Fig. 3. Consider a certain figure, say the circle in red. It is transformed by $S_N$ into the circle on the unit sphere materialized by black little diamonds ; this circle is transformed in turn by $S_S$ into the blue circle on the equatorial plane... which is the inversive image of the initial red circle. Briefly said : $$\tag{$\star$}I=S_S \circ S_N$$ This shouldn't come as a surprise because stereographic projections are themselves 3D inversions. See ( composition of stereographic projections is inversion through the ball - a geometric way ) for a proof. Fig. 3. (planar) inversion realized by combining two stereographic projections (formula ( $\star$ )). "" How inversion transform is connected with linear algebra "" (in fact connected with item 1) ; this issue looks paradoxical because inversion is definitely not a linear transform. In fact, there exists a group, the anallagmatic group, with a $4 \times 4$ linear representation (also called conformal geometry group). Moreover, this group includes another category of non-linear transforms, translations. Reference: the very good book ""Riemannian Geometry"" by S. Gallot, D. Hullin, J. Lafontaine, 2nd edition 1993. Universitext, Springer, pages 175-176. Here is how this correspondence is done (Explanations will be found in this book or in the very interesting development by @MvG cited in 4a): $$\text{If} \ J \ \text{is the basic inversion (center 0, power 1):}$$ $$[J]:=\begin{pmatrix}0&0&0&1\\0&1&0&0\\0&0&1&0\\1&0&0&0\end{pmatrix}.$$ $$\text{If} \ H_r \ \text{is the homothety with ratio} \ r \ \text{and center} \ 0: $$ $$[H_r]:=\begin{pmatrix}1&0&0&0\\0&r&0&0\\0&0&r&0\\0&0&0&r^2\end{pmatrix}.$$ $$\text{If} \ T_V \ \text{is the translation by vector} \ V=\binom{a}{b} :$$ $$[T_V]:=\begin{pmatrix}1&0&0&0\\2a&1&0&0\\2b&0&1&0\\a^2+b^2&a&b&1\end{pmatrix}.$$ All these transformations preserve the following quadratic form: $$q(x_0;x_1,x_2,x_3):=x_1^2+x_2^2-x_0x_3$$ where $x_0$ should be considered as a homogeneous coordinate (i.e., is there to take into account the projective dimension). The signature of $q$ being $(+++-)$ , we are dealing with elements of the group classically denoted $O(3,1)$ . This correspondence with 2D transforms can be extended in a straightforward way to higher dimensions (for $n$ D transforms, the correspondence is with $(n+2) \times (n+2)$ matrices). This reference (jump to slides beginning at slide 130) uses linear algebra in $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ . (specific to the 2D case): Complex representation : Inversion with the unit circle $S^1=\{z\in\mathbb{C}\,|\,|z|=1$ } as invariant circle is the map $$I : \begin{cases}\ \begin{array}{ccc}\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\}&\longrightarrow&\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\}\\z&\mapsto&\frac{1}{\overline z}\end{array}\end{cases}$$ Result : Any (2D) rotation can be obtained as a certain combination of translations and inversions. It is a consequence of the following identity (as given in https://mathoverflow.net/q/19965 ) : $$e^{i \theta} + \frac{1}{-e^{-i \theta} + \frac{1}{e^{i \theta} + \frac{1}{z}}} = - e^{2 i \theta} z. \tag{%}$$ If we conjugate both sides of (%), we get : $$e^{-i \theta} + \frac{1}{\overline{-e^{-i \theta} + \frac{1}{\overline{e^{-i \theta} + \frac{1}{\overline{z}}}}}} = - e^{-2 i \theta}\overline{z}. \tag{%%}$$ (The LHS of (%%) can be written in a symbolic way as : $T_{e^{-i \theta}}\circ I \circ T_{-e^{-i \theta}} \circ I \circ T_{e^{-i \theta}} \circ I$ ). If we take $\theta=0$ in (%%), one gets : $$1+ \frac{1}{\overline{-1 + \frac{1}{\overline{1 + \frac{1}{\overline{z}}}}}} = - \overline{z}. \tag{%%%}$$ (Please note the conjugation bar). Preservation of crossratio: $$\dfrac{AC.BD}{BC.AD}=\dfrac{A'C'.B'D'}{B'C'.A'D'}$$ (see figure 4). Fig. 4: Preservation of crossratio.

Appendix 1: Recall of properties of inversion as depicted by Fig. 1: The image of a straight line is in general a circle passing through the pole $C$ ; exceptionally, when the straight line passes through the origin, its image is the line itself (caution: in the latter case, the straight line is ""globally"" invariant, but its points, in general, aren't invariant). The image $\Gamma'$ of a circle $\Gamma$ not passing through the origin is a circle of the same type (caution: the center of $\Gamma'$ is not the image of the center of $\Gamma$ ; nevertheless these centers are aligned with the pole of inversion). The image of a circle passing through the origin is a straight line, as said before. The image of the black fish made of line segments is the red fish made of circular arcs swimming in its blue round fishbowl. Appendix 2: Explanation of inversion depicted in Fig. 2. Let us begin by another definition of inversion. $$\tag{3}J_{C,k}:M \to M' \ \ \ \  \iff \ \ \ \ \  \exists  \vec{U} \ \text{(unit norm vector) s.t.} \ \begin{cases}\vec{CM}=\lambda \vec{U}\\ \vec{CM'}=\lambda' \vec{U}\end{cases} \ \text{and}  \ \lambda\lambda'=k^2$$ Let $M(x,y)$ and $M'(x',y')$ exchanged by inversion $J_{C,k}$ . Let $M_0(x,y,x^2+y^2)$ and $M_0'(x',y',x'^2+y'^2)$ be their ""lifted version"" on paraboloid $\Pi$ . Let $N(X,Y,Z) $ be any point of line $C_0M_0$ . We can define an abscissa $\mu$ on this line for point $N$ in the following way: $$\tag{$\star$}\vec{C_0N}=\mu \vec{C_0M_0} \ \ \ \ \iff \ \ \ \ \begin{cases}X=a+\mu(x-a)\\ Y=b+\mu(y-b)\\ Z=c+\mu(x^2+y^2-c)\end{cases}$$ with $$c:=a^2+b^2-k^2.$$ Please note that for $\mu=1$ , $N$ is in $M_0$ . Let $\lambda'$ be the value of $\mu$ associated with $M'_0$ . Thus $N \in \Pi$ in two cases: when $\mu=1$ ( $N=M_0$ ) and when $\mu=\lambda'$ ( $N=M'_0$ ). As $$\tag{3}N \in \Pi \ \iff \ Z=X^2+Y^2,$$ plugging in (3) the expressions of $X,Y,Z$ in $(\star)$ , and replacing $c$ by its defining expression, we obtain the following quadratic equation with unknown $\mu$ : $$\mu^2[(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2] \ + \ \mu[\cdots] \ + \ k^2=0$$ Using the classical formula for the roots' product, we have $$\lambda' \times 1 =\dfrac{k^2}{(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2}=\dfrac{k^2}{\|\vec{CM}\|^2}$$ We find back here the definition of inversion given in (2) (recall that $\vec{CM}$ hasn't been normalized).","Inversion transform with center (or pole) and power is defined by: It is an ""involutive"" transform: is the image of iff is the image of .

The image of a circle not passing through the origin is a circle of the same type (caution: the center of is not the image of the center of ; nevertheless these centers are aligned with the pole of inversion). The image of a circle passing through the origin is a straight line, as said before. The image of the black fish made of line segments is the red fish made of circular arcs swimming in its blue round fishbowl. Appendix 2: Explanation of inversion depicted in Fig. 2. Let us begin by another definition of inversion. Let and exchanged by inversion . Let and be their ""lifted version"" on paraboloid . Let be any point of line . We can define an abscissa on this line for point in the following way: with Please note that for , is in . Let be the value of associated with . Thus in two cases: when ( ) and when ( ). As plugging in (3) the expressions of in , and replacing by its defining expression, we obtain the following quadratic equation with unknown : Using the classical formula for the roots' product, we have We find back here the definition of inversion given in (2) (recall that hasn't been normalized).","C k^2 \tag{1}J_{C,k}:M \leftrightarrow M' \ \ \ \ \ \iff \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \vec{CM'}=\frac{k^2}{||\vec{CM}||^2} \ \vec{CM}  M' M M M' C C k P\Gamma P^{-1} \Pi P \Pi \Gamma \Pi \Pi C_0(a,b,a^2+b^2-k^2) (a,b) C \Pi \to \Pi S_N S_S S_N S_S \tag{\star}I=S_S \circ S_N \star 4 \times 4 \text{If} \ J \ \text{is the basic inversion (center 0, power 1):} [J]:=\begin{pmatrix}0&0&0&1\\0&1&0&0\\0&0&1&0\\1&0&0&0\end{pmatrix}. \text{If} \ H_r \ \text{is the homothety with ratio} \ r \ \text{and center} \ 0:  [H_r]:=\begin{pmatrix}1&0&0&0\\0&r&0&0\\0&0&r&0\\0&0&0&r^2\end{pmatrix}. \text{If} \ T_V \ \text{is the translation by vector} \ V=\binom{a}{b} : [T_V]:=\begin{pmatrix}1&0&0&0\\2a&1&0&0\\2b&0&1&0\\a^2+b^2&a&b&1\end{pmatrix}. q(x_0;x_1,x_2,x_3):=x_1^2+x_2^2-x_0x_3 x_0 q (+++-) O(3,1) n (n+2) \times (n+2) SL(2,\mathbb{C}) S^1=\{z\in\mathbb{C}\,|\,|z|=1 I : \begin{cases}\ \begin{array}{ccc}\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\}&\longrightarrow&\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\}\\z&\mapsto&\frac{1}{\overline z}\end{array}\end{cases} e^{i \theta} + \frac{1}{-e^{-i \theta} + \frac{1}{e^{i \theta} + \frac{1}{z}}} = - e^{2 i \theta} z. \tag{%} e^{-i \theta} + \frac{1}{\overline{-e^{-i \theta} + \frac{1}{\overline{e^{-i \theta} + \frac{1}{\overline{z}}}}}} = - e^{-2 i \theta}\overline{z}. \tag{%%} T_{e^{-i \theta}}\circ I \circ T_{-e^{-i \theta}} \circ I \circ T_{e^{-i \theta}} \circ I \theta=0 1+ \frac{1}{\overline{-1 + \frac{1}{\overline{1 + \frac{1}{\overline{z}}}}}} = - \overline{z}. \tag{%%%} \dfrac{AC.BD}{BC.AD}=\dfrac{A'C'.B'D'}{B'C'.A'D'} AB A'B' C \Gamma' \Gamma \Gamma' \Gamma \tag{3}J_{C,k}:M \to M' \ \ \ \  \iff \ \ \ \ \  \exists  \vec{U} \ \text{(unit norm vector) s.t.} \ \begin{cases}\vec{CM}=\lambda \vec{U}\\ \vec{CM'}=\lambda' \vec{U}\end{cases} \ \text{and}  \ \lambda\lambda'=k^2 M(x,y) M'(x',y') J_{C,k} M_0(x,y,x^2+y^2) M_0'(x',y',x'^2+y'^2) \Pi N(X,Y,Z)  C_0M_0 \mu N \tag{\star}\vec{C_0N}=\mu \vec{C_0M_0} \ \ \ \ \iff \ \ \ \ \begin{cases}X=a+\mu(x-a)\\ Y=b+\mu(y-b)\\ Z=c+\mu(x^2+y^2-c)\end{cases} c:=a^2+b^2-k^2. \mu=1 N M_0 \lambda' \mu M'_0 N \in \Pi \mu=1 N=M_0 \mu=\lambda' N=M'_0 \tag{3}N \in \Pi \ \iff \ Z=X^2+Y^2, X,Y,Z (\star) c \mu \mu^2[(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2] \ + \ \mu[\cdots] \ + \ k^2=0 \lambda' \times 1 =\dfrac{k^2}{(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2}=\dfrac{k^2}{\|\vec{CM}\|^2} \vec{CM}","['geometry', 'circles', 'big-list', 'conformal-geometry', 'inversive-geometry']"
32,Can any higher-dimensional Spheres be rotated everywhere equally?,Can any higher-dimensional Spheres be rotated everywhere equally?,,"You can rotate a circle so that every point on it (just the perimeter, not the interior) moves ""equally"".  That is, every point moves with the same speed and even has the same ""acceleration"" (first-order derivative of velocity, which is the first-order derivative of a point's movement wrt time). However, there is no way to rotate a sphere with this same character: the farthest points from the axis of rotation (equator) move much faster and have greater acceleration than the points closest to the axis (poles). AFAIK, there is no closed (finite, no edges) 3-dimensional surface with this property.  You can do it with a cylinder, but that is not a closed shape. You could also do it with a torus by rotating it through the center (rather than around the center) the way a smoke ring does, but that's not a true ""rigid"" rotation (all points maintain the same distance to all other points throughout the rotation).  The points on the inner part of the ring are closer together than those on the outside. What I've been wondering is how this plays out in higher dimensions?  Can the volume-surface of a 4D sphere be rigidly rotated equally like a 2D circle?  Or does it fall to the same problems as 3D spheres?  What about even higher dimensional spheres? For that matter, are there any higher dimensional closed shapes that can be so rotated? For clarity, I am only looking for ""smooth"" shapes, no significant discontinuities, and not just a disconnected set of points.","You can rotate a circle so that every point on it (just the perimeter, not the interior) moves ""equally"".

Different sized Rubber bands can wrap around the pegs of geoboard, which can form a large number of patterns and shapes. An example of this is shown in the picture below. When I was a kid I had a computer program that was a digital version of a geoboard. The program had a square grid of nodes. The grid was ten nodes by ten nodes. Nodes on the grid could be connected by line segments. One feature of the digital geoboard is that if a closed shape was formed by line segments, the perimeter of the shape could be measured. One unit on the geoboard was the distance between two adjacent points in the horizontal or vertical direction. Here is a YouTube video of the program. One thing I tried to do during the time when I had the program was to find the largest perimeter closed shape that I could create with the grid.

Label the points $P_1,P_2,P_3,\dots,P_{3n}$ in order of increasing $x$ -coordinates. Form triangles $\triangle P_1P_2P_3,\space \triangle P_4P_5P_6,\space \dots,\space \triangle P_{3n-2}P_{3n-1}P_{3n}$ . Here is an example with $3n=21$ . What does the total area of the triangles approach as $n\to\infty$ ? I did a simulation of $100$ trials with $3n=99999$ , and the average total area was $0.318343178$ . This number multiplied by $\pi$ is approximately $1.00010$ , so I conjecture that the answer is $1/\pi$ . My attempt I considered a simpler related question: What is the expected area of a triangle with vertices $(1,a_1),(2,a_2),(3,a_3)$ where the $a$ values are independent uniformly random real numbers in $[0,1]$ ? The probability that $a_2$ is between $a_1$ and $a_3$ is $1/3$ . We have $\mathbb{E}(\max (a_1,a_2,a_3)-\min (a_1,a_2,a_3))=\frac12$ ( explanation ). The left and right sub-triangles share a vertical side, which in this case has expected length $\frac18$ . So the expected area of the triangle is $2\times\frac12\times\frac18\times 1=\frac18$ . The probability that $a_2$ is not between $a_1$ and $a_3$ is $2/3$ . Again we have $\mathbb{E}(\max (a_1,a_2,a_3)-\min (a_1,a_2,a_3))=\frac12$ . The left and right sub-triangles share a vertical side, which in this case has expected length $\frac38$ . So the expected area of the triangle is $2\times\frac12\times\frac38\times 1=\frac38$ . So the overall expected area of the triangle is $\frac13\times\frac18+\frac23\times\frac38=\frac{7}{24}$ . This value is supported by a simulation. In the original question, the triangles are not limited to a rectangular box of height $1$ , but rather are limited to a unit disk, which has an average height of $2\int_0^1\sqrt{1-x^2}\mathrm dx=\frac{\pi}{2}$ . The rectangle and the disk have the same width, but in the disk there are horizontal gaps between neighboring triangles, so we multiply by a factor of $\frac23$ . So the total area of the triangles in the disk should approach approximately $\frac{7}{24}\times\frac{\pi}{2}\times\frac23=\frac{7\pi}{72}\approx 0.30543$ . This is slightly less than $\frac{1}{\pi}\approx 0.31831$ . The difference may be due to the fact that the $x$ -coordinates of the points in the disk do not have equal spacing. EDIT: I made a mistake in my simulation. Using the shoelace theorem , the area of the triangle with vertices $(x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2),(x_3,y_3)$ is $\frac12|x_1y_2-x_2y_1+x_2y_3-x_3y_2-x_1y_3+x_3y_1|$ , but I was accidentally using $\frac12|x_1y_2-x_2y_1+x_2y_3-x_3y_2-x_1y_3+x_\color{red}{1}y_1|$ . After correcting, my simulations suggest the answer is approximately $0.320$ , which agrees with @Rei Henigman's answer. So I no longer think my conjecture is true, but I would still like to know if the limiting area of the triangles has a closed form. I also did a (correct) simulation using a square lamina instead of a disk, and it seems that the proportion covered by the triangles is about $0.102$ , which seems to match the proportion in the disk. Context This question was inspired by the question ""A disc contains $n$ random points. Each point is connected to its nearest neighbor.

So the expected area of the triangle is . So the overall expected area of the triangle is . This value is supported by a simulation. In the original question, the triangles are not limited to a rectangular box of height , but rather are limited to a unit disk, which has an average height of . The rectangle and the disk have the same width, but in the disk there are horizontal gaps between neighboring triangles, so we multiply by a factor of . So the total area of the triangles in the disk should approach approximately . This is slightly less than . The difference may be due to the fact that the -coordinates of the points in the disk do not have equal spacing. EDIT: I made a mistake in my simulation. Using the shoelace theorem , the area of the triangle with vertices is , but I was accidentally using . After correcting, my simulations suggest the answer is approximately , which agrees with @Rei Henigman's answer. So I no longer think my conjecture is true, but I would still like to know if the limiting area of the triangles has a closed form. I also did a (correct) simulation using a square lamina instead of a disk, and it seems that the proportion covered by the triangles is about , which seems to match the proportion in the disk.

58,How can the centers of these 5 related circles be specified as a formula?,How can the centers of these 5 related circles be specified as a formula?,,"This is my first time posting in this forum, so please forgive me if my question is too involved or if I've posted it in the wrong area. I hope someone finds it interesting enough to try their hand at it. Considering the image below, I am trying to work out a set of formulas that will specify either the radii or the center points for the five unknown single-colored circles. If I can determine either the radii or the center points for the particular five circles that I'll describe below, then I believe I can easily determine all of the remaining points of intersection in the drawing. In case the picture doesn't show up inline, or if you want to open it in another window so you can see it while you read the rest of the problem, here are a few different links to it: https://i.sstatic.net/VbFdk.png https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_Z0g0E9vLRARDFRcUdRVU1UN2c/view https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/EUiU3InO9qy-se2WGa1-DCAGs50K5ICtbE_GGWm578OaQjmOL3I9tHWjhCV1dge4eZsYrA_PZzU=w1142-h814 Regarding the drawing, the following facts are given: 1) All 4 corners of the bounding rectangle are 90 degrees. 2) The lower left corner is considered to be the origin (0,0). 3) The lower edge is 1 unit in length. 4) The Red quarter-circle has its center at (0,0) and a radius of 1. 5) The center of the Purple and Blue circles are on the Y axis. 6) The centers of the Orange and Yellow circles are on the vertical line defined by X=1. 7) All of the circles are tangent to one another wherever they appear to be so in the drawing. (This isn't a visual trick. They aren't 'just close'.) 8) Similarly, all of the straight lines shown are between centers of various circles and are either tangent or normal to the circles wherever they appear to be so. (Again, this isn't a trick question.) 9) The Green circle and the Blue and Yellow Half circles are all tangent to the top of the bounding rectangle, just as they appear to be. Since the center and radius of the Red circle are both given, the problem consists of determining the center and/or radius of the remaining Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue and Purple circles (or partial circles). The remaining straight lines and multi-colored circles are given as additional geometric hints, showing for example that the points of tangency for any three of the mutually tangent circles in question will always fall on a multi-colored circle whose center is at the intersection of the lines that bisect the angles formed by the centers of the respective circles. Now that's a lot of words for one sentence, so let me try to break it down and explain one case as an example. Consider the mutually tangent Purple, Green and Orange circles. The triangle drawn between their centers, intersects each of them at their respective points of tangency. The three lines that bisect the three corners of that triangle will necessarily intersect at a common point. That point of intersection is the center of the  multi-colored Purple/Green/Orange circle that overlaps the original three. Furthermore, lines drawn from the center of this new circle to the three original points of tangency are also tangent to the original circles at the same points of tangency shared by each pair of original circles. Finally, the resulting triangles are necessarily all right triangles! When all of the circles and arcs are removed from the drawing, what remains is a set of 35 right triangles that completely fill the outer rectangle. These triangles can be grouped by the color of the circle that originally generated them: 4 are Red (16 if it was repeated to form a full circle.) 7 are Orange (14 if it was repeated to form a full circle.) 6 are Purple (12 if it was repeated to form a full circle.) 10 are Green (10, and it is the only single colored full circle.) 4 are Yellow (8 if it was repeated to form a full circle.) 4 are Blue (8 if it was repeated to form a full circle.) Another interesting point. The top of the Orange and Purple circles may initially appear to be at the same height. In fact, they are not. It turns out that they can't be the same if all of the other rules are met. They just happen to be close. Actually, if the Blue, Green and Yellow circles were taken out of the picture and the rectangle shortened and the Purple and Orange circles resized slightly so that their tops were both at the same level, then the problem is very simple to solve for just those two circles. It's only when the three remaining circles are added to the top as I have shown that the problem gets just past the edge of my ability. Although I don't want to expound on it here, I have actually build a spreadsheet that reflects nearly all of the mutual dependencies, but since the spreadsheet can't have circular references, it ultimately ends up with two different independent forks or branches of calculations and the only way I have been able to solve it is to set one cell equal to the difference between the final equations on each branch. This difference represents the cumulative error between the branches using the baseline estimated angles. I then have Excel apply successive approximation - using ""What-if"" - to adjust the approximated values until the error becomes as nearly zero as possible. This approach gets me close enough for the practical purpose of drawing it here, but it still leaves my original question unanswered. To reiterate: How can I derive a formula that exactly defines either the radii or the center points for each the five circles I've specified? One final note, I suspect that this may end up requiring a calculus solution. If so, it's over my head (for now). I'll still appreciate any responses, but I'm hoping for a solution that I can follow using just geometry, trig and algebra. A compass and straight-edge solution, in the unlikely case that it's even possible, would be really cool, but probably wouldn't answer my real question.

86,Why is the inradius of any triangle at most half its circumradius?,Why is the inradius of any triangle at most half its circumradius?,,"Is there any geometrically simple reason why the inradius of a triangle should be at most half its circumradius? I end up wanting the fact for this answer . I know of two proofs of this fact. Proof 1: The radius of the nine-point circle is half the circumradius. Feuerbach's theorem states that the incircle is internally tangent to the nine-point circle, and hence has a smaller radius. Proof 2: The Steiner inellipse is the inconic with the largest area. The Steiner circumellipse is the circumconic with the smallest area, and has 4 times the area of the Steiner inellipse. Hence the circumcircle has at least 4 times the area of the incircle. These both feel kind of sledgehammerish to me; I'd be happier if there were some nice Euclidean-geometry proof (or a way to convince myself that no such thing is likely to exist, so the sledgehammer is necessary).
