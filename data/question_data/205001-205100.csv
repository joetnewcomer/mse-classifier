17,Vertices and edges of a cube are assigned natural numbers in a particular way; can the sum of the vertices equal the sum of the edges?,Vertices and edges of a cube are assigned natural numbers in a particular way; can the sum of the vertices equal the sum of the edges?,,"At the vertices of a cube are written 8 different natural numbers, and on each of its edges is written the greatest common divisor of the numbers at the endpoints of the edge. Can the sum of the numbers written at the vertices be the same as the sum of the numbers written at the edges? I have no idea where to go with this question. Here are some ideas: There is a mistake in the above picture. I missed out two edges, b and c. The vertices can be arranged in this manner, where no letter past a is equal to one. All of the terms cancel out except for abc+ some vertex V for the sum of the vertices, and a+b+c+unknown edges x+y+z which all depend on what value to give V. I cannot decide this at all. Other ideas presented to me, as well was what I believe, is that this just is not possible. However, I have no way of proving that. Here are some ideas from another who tried this with me: Clearly, if there were only as many edges as vertices it would never work, as the value of a connecting edge must be smaller than at least one of its vertex values. In the best case scenario one vertex is a and the other ab, then you get an edge value of a, but the vertex ab is necessarily bigger. However, there are more edges than vertices, so one might hope to get some clever settings which work out. Here some ideas against that hope: You can't have just the majority of vertices being primes, because then two connected primes only give you a 1 on the edge and so to beat all the vertex primes, you'd need a couple of very bid edges. To get big edges you need at least one big vertex which isn't prime, so we conclude that there must be some bigger vertex somewhere. But, say one big vertex is ab with b>a with a=>2.There are only three outgoing edges, so to not lose, you want all of them carry the b. But then the other side of these edges must be bc with c>2. Hence all the vertices together are somethink like (a+c+d+e)*d and the edges are only 3b. This is no proof, but an argument against a vertex with only two prime factors. But then I played around and and saw that vertices the number 2*3*5 is really the only one that wins over it's edges Please help!","At the vertices of a cube are written 8 different natural numbers, and on each of its edges is written the greatest common divisor of the numbers at the endpoints of the edge. Can the sum of the numbers written at the vertices be the same as the sum of the numbers written at the edges? I have no idea where to go with this question. Here are some ideas: There is a mistake in the above picture. I missed out two edges, b and c. The vertices can be arranged in this manner, where no letter past a is equal to one. All of the terms cancel out except for abc+ some vertex V for the sum of the vertices, and a+b+c+unknown edges x+y+z which all depend on what value to give V. I cannot decide this at all. Other ideas presented to me, as well was what I believe, is that this just is not possible. However, I have no way of proving that. Here are some ideas from another who tried this with me: Clearly, if there were only as many edges as vertices it would never work, as the value of a connecting edge must be smaller than at least one of its vertex values. In the best case scenario one vertex is a and the other ab, then you get an edge value of a, but the vertex ab is necessarily bigger. However, there are more edges than vertices, so one might hope to get some clever settings which work out. Here some ideas against that hope: You can't have just the majority of vertices being primes, because then two connected primes only give you a 1 on the edge and so to beat all the vertex primes, you'd need a couple of very bid edges. To get big edges you need at least one big vertex which isn't prime, so we conclude that there must be some bigger vertex somewhere. But, say one big vertex is ab with b>a with a=>2.There are only three outgoing edges, so to not lose, you want all of them carry the b. But then the other side of these edges must be bc with c>2. Hence all the vertices together are somethink like (a+c+d+e)*d and the edges are only 3b. This is no proof, but an argument against a vertex with only two prime factors.

Prove or disprove: If $|A \cup B \cup C | = |A| + |B| + |C|$ , then $A, B$ , and $C$ must be pairwise disjoint. I started with inclusion-exclusion formula $$|A \cup B \cup C | = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C|$$ Hypothesis says if $|A \cup B \cup C | = |A| + |B| + |C|$ , then expression $|A \cap B \cap C|  - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| $ , must be equal to zero. So, we have $$ |A \cap B \cap C|  - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C|  = 0$$ $$ |A \cap B \cap C|  = |A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |B \cap C| \tag{1}$$ Now, I am not sure how finish this proof. I found two ways, but I do not know if are correct. First way If $x \in |A \cap B \cap C|$ , then $x \in |A \cap B| \wedge x\in |A \cap C| \wedge x \in |B \cap C|$ . So if we count the cardinality of $|A \cap B \cap C|  = |A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |B \cap C|$ , then if $x \in |A \cap B \cap C|$ then $x$ is counted once but on RHS $x$ is counted three times.

43,Relations between n-ary relations,Relations between n-ary relations,,"I preface my question by stating that I have no scholarly expertise in mathematics. I have a Ph.D. in philosophy and have recently developed an interest in logic, but even logic is outside of my professional expertise. I can only hope that my ignorance in the matter that interests me is not beyond remedy. As I understand, a relation is understood in discrete mathematics as a set of ordered n-tuples. So suppose that there are two ternary relations that consist of different triples on (is ""on"" the right preposition to use here?) the same set of objects. For example, suppose that, on the set of positive integers, R1 is the set of triples (x, y, z) such that x < y < z, while R2 is the set of triples (x, y, z) such that y < x < z. I would say that there is a one-to-one correspondence between members of R1 (is ""members"" the right word? I mean the triples that belong to R1) and members of R2 in accordance with a consistent rule of permutation. But I don't know if I am describing the relation between the two relations correctly. If I am not, I hope that my intended meaning is clear enough that someone can restate it for me in a correct fashion. All of that is just to set up my main question, which is: Is there a simple way to describe the relation between R1 and R2? I have chosen a pair of ternary relations for my example, but the relations could be of any -arity. I deliberately did not use a binary relation, because that sort of case does not present the same difficulties. As I understand, two binary relations that stand in the sort of correspondence that I have described are said to be inverses of each other. (One would say ""converses"" in logic, but apparently ""inverse"" is the term standardly used in mathematics; please correct me if I am mistaken on this point.) Can one say that R1 and R2 are inverses of each other?","I preface my question by stating that I have no scholarly expertise in mathematics.

I can only hope that my ignorance in the matter that interests me is not beyond remedy. As I understand, a relation is understood in discrete mathematics as a set of ordered n-tuples. So suppose that there are two ternary relations that consist of different triples on (is ""on"" the right preposition to use here?) the same set of objects. For example, suppose that, on the set of positive integers, R1 is the set of triples (x, y, z) such that x < y < z, while R2 is the set of triples (x, y, z) such that y < x < z. I would say that there is a one-to-one correspondence between members of R1 (is ""members"" the right word? I mean the triples that belong to R1) and members of R2 in accordance with a consistent rule of permutation. But I don't know if I am describing the relation between the two relations correctly. If I am not, I hope that my intended meaning is clear enough that someone can restate it for me in a correct fashion. All of that is just to set up my main question, which is: Is there a simple way to describe the relation between R1 and R2? I have chosen a pair of ternary relations for my example, but the relations could be of any -arity. I deliberately did not use a binary relation, because that sort of case does not present the same difficulties. As I understand, two binary relations that stand in the sort of correspondence that I have described are said to be inverses of each other. (One would say ""converses"" in logic, but apparently ""inverse"" is the term standardly used in mathematics; please correct me if I am mistaken on this point.)

I am new to coding theory so I am having some troubles with this particular question... If it corrects $1$ mistakes, that means that $d>2\cdot1$ (I believe this is a well-known result [I prove it at my courses]), where $d$ is the minimal distance of the code $\mathcal{C}$ defined as $d=d(\mathcal{C})=\min\{d(x,y)|x,y\in \mathcal{C},x\neq y\}$ , and that distance in the definition is the Hamming distance defined as $d(x,y)=\#\{i|1\leq i\leq n,x_{i}\neq y_{i}\}$ , being $x=(x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n})$ and $y=(y_{1},y_{2},...,y_{n})$ elements in $\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}$ (where $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ is the alphabet of the code, and $n$ denotes the length of the words). So, in my particular case I want that the minimal distance of the code is greater than $2$ , i.e., I want that there are no two different words in the code that have Hamming distance equal or lesser than $2$ , i.e., no two words in the code that have more than $4$ coordinates equal to each other (as If they have four equal to each other, there would be $6-4=2$ different to each other, so the Hamming distance would be $2$ , and if there are $5$ equal to each other, the Hamming distance would be $1$ which is not valid). So, I begin to construct the code, by taking the first word: $$ 	(1,1,1,1,1,1)\in\mathbb{F}_{2}^{6} 	$$ Then, I could take another one like: $$ 	(1,1,1,0,0,0)\in\mathbb{F}_{2}^{6} 	$$ which satisfies the previous conditions. So, taking this kind of words, and taking on account the conditions that must hold, I could keep going with this ''constructive algorithm'' until I have $5$ words. For example: $$ 	(1,0,0,1,0,0)\in\mathbb{F}_{2}^{6} 	$$ $$ 	(0,1,0,1,1,0)\in\mathbb{F}_{2}^{6} 	$$ $$ 	(0,0,0,0,0,0)\in\mathbb{F}_{2}^{6} 	$$ And this would conclude the exercise (by taking all this $5$ words listed above).

(We can assume the board has a black-white checkerboard coloration.) For my partial attempt, I let $ P(n, k) $ be the claim that a $ 2n \times k $ checkerboard missing a white and a black cell can be covered by dominoes. I also noted that, in order for $ P(n, k) $ to be true, we must have $ n \geq 1 $ and $ k \geq 2 $ i.e. both sides of the checkerboard must have length at least 2. But after that, I wasn't sure what the basis and inductive steps would be.  For the basis step, I proved $ P(1, 2) $ true, but I probably should've include more base cases, just didn't know which ones. The inductive step was the hardest part for me. I was fairly certain this would be a proof by strong induction, since the inductive step probably involves splitting up a checkerboard into smaller boards. The issue here is that at least one of these smaller boards will not have a black and a white cell missing, meaning we cannot directly apply the inductive hypothesis. I was also feeling iffy about applying induction on a proposition containing two variables, since we only learned how to do induction on propositions of one variable. But I couldn't figure out a formulation of the claim that uses only one variable and covers all cases for the dimensions of the board. Is there a less convoluted way of going about doing this?

I understand and have worked out how to show the first part.  However, I do not understand part 2. Can I get some help please?",,"['discrete-mathematics', 'cryptography']"

Use the definition of “$f (x)$ is $O(g(x))$” to show that: $x^4 + 9x^3 + 4x + 7$ is $O(x^4)$ I tried dividing both sides by $x^4$, but I'm not sure how to find a tight bound without repeatedly guessing and checking. Another way to phrase this problem: After modifying C, so that $g(x)$ approximates $f(x)$, how would one find the intersection of the two functions. P.S. I'm studying for a test so I'm looking for how to solve these problems in general.","Definition : A function F(x) is Big-O of g(x) if we can find constant witnesses such that  $f(x) <= Cg(x)$ when $x=k$.

93,Stable Marriage - set of preferences such that every arrangement is stable?,Stable Marriage - set of preferences such that every arrangement is stable?,,"This is a homework problem from the MIT OCW math for CS class, assignment 4, problem 5. Prove or disprove the following claim: for some n ≥ 3 (n boys and n girls, for a total of 2n people), there exists a set of boys’ and girls’ preferences such that every dating arrangement is stable. As I understand it, this is asking for a set of preferences such that any combination of matchings is stable. Informally, my thought was to show by contradiction this is not possible. I assume the theorem is true, then there must be some combination such that every male is paired with his least favorite partner. In this case, assuming the theory holds, then every female must prefer their partner the most. Otherwise, if any female prefered any other male more, they would form a rogue couple. This then would be true starting with the female set, that is there exists a combination such that each female is paired with her least favorite, so each male must like his partner the most. Given this, and that we are looking at every combination, there must exist a combination of two couples such that a male is with his least favorite and a female is with her least favorite (who are different people because of the idea above). This would create a non-stable matching, so there is a contradiction. I feel this is wrong somehow, and that I am missing something obvious. Would someone point me in the right direction? I am sorry if this is way off base or too informal, I do not have a background in math, and trying to teach myself has been fun but slow going without anyone to consult.","This is a homework problem from the MIT OCW math for CS class, assignment 4, problem 5.
