Doesn't seem very correct to me. Thanks for your thoughts :) Oliver Oloa gave a hint on Sandwich theorem but removed answer. $$\sum_{r=1}^{n} \frac{r}{n^2 + n + n} \le \sum_{r=1}^{n} \frac{r}{n^2 + n + r} \le \sum_{r=1}^{n} \frac{r}{n^2 + n + 1}$$ Using this I think we get $1/2 \le L \le 1/2$ so limit is $1/2$.",,"['sequences-and-series', 'summation']"

Introduction: An exercise from ""Principles of mathematical Analysis, third edition"" by Rudin, page 78. Exercise: Calculate $\lim_{n\to\infty}(\sqrt{n^2+n}-n)$. Explanation: I have a hard time to grasp how to handle limits like this. I don't know how to start and what to look for. I've checked with mathematica and the answer should be $\frac{1}{2}$, and of course i've got the wrong answer. I find limits unintuitive. In the book, they proved ""the limits of some sequences which occur frequently"". The limits they proved were: (a) If $p>0$ then $\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n^p}=0$ (b) If $p>0$ then $\lim_{n\to\infty}\sqrt[n]{p}=1$ (c) $\lim_{n\to\infty}\sqrt[n]{n}=1$ (d) If $p>0$ and $\alpha$ is real, then $\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{n^\alpha}{(1+p)^n}=0$ (e) If $|x|<1$, then $\lim_{n\to\infty}x^n=0$. When they proved all of the above theorems it felt like they used the fact that they knew the limits. For example: Proof of (b): If $p>1$, put $x_n=\sqrt[n]{p}-1$. Then, $x_n>0$ and by the binomial theorem, $$1+nx_n\leq(1+x_n)^n=p$$ so that $$0<x_n\leq\frac{p-1}{n}.$$ Hence $x_n\to 0$. And so on... That is, I think they used the fact that the limit were 1 when they did put $x_n=\sqrt[n]{p}-1$. Before I compute a limit do I have to guess one? How can I do that when I don't think this is intuitive? Have you any tips how you do when you shall tackle a problem like this? How do you start when you want to compute a limit? Solution: This is how I did it: $\sqrt{n^2+n}-n=\sqrt{n}\sqrt{n-1}-n=\sqrt{n}(\sqrt{n-1}-\sqrt{n})$. Since $$(\sqrt{n-1}-\sqrt{n})\to 0\text{ when }n\to\infty.$$ The product approaches $0$. Which is obviously not true. I did realise this after a while. Since one of the factor grows really big while the other gets really small and I guess they tend to take each other out, so it's pretty clear it shouldn't approach 0, but I don't think it's clear that it should approach $\frac{1}{2}$ either.

I've checked with mathematica and the answer should be $\frac{1}{2}$, and of course i've got the wrong answer. I find limits unintuitive. In the book, they proved ""the limits of some sequences which occur frequently"". The limits they proved were: (a) If $p>0$ then $\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n^p}=0$ (b) If $p>0$ then $\lim_{n\to\infty}\sqrt[n]{p}=1$ (c) $\lim_{n\to\infty}\sqrt[n]{n}=1$ (d) If $p>0$ and $\alpha$ is real, then $\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{n^\alpha}{(1+p)^n}=0$ (e) If $|x|<1$, then $\lim_{n\to\infty}x^n=0$. When they proved all of the above theorems it felt like they used the fact that they knew the limits. For example: Proof of (b): If $p>1$, put $x_n=\sqrt[n]{p}-1$. Then, $x_n>0$ and by the binomial theorem, $$1+nx_n\leq(1+x_n)^n=p$$ so that $$0<x_n\leq\frac{p-1}{n}.$$ Hence $x_n\to 0$. And so on... That is, I think they used the fact that the limit were 1 when they did put $x_n=\sqrt[n]{p}-1$. Before I compute a limit do I have to guess one? How can I do that when I don't think this is intuitive? Have you any tips how you do when you shall tackle a problem like this? How do you start when you want to compute a limit? Solution: This is how I did it: $\sqrt{n^2+n}-n=\sqrt{n}\sqrt{n-1}-n=\sqrt{n}(\sqrt{n-1}-\sqrt{n})$. Since $$(\sqrt{n-1}-\sqrt{n})\to 0\text{ when }n\to\infty.$$ The product approaches $0$. Which is obviously not true. I did realise this after a while. Since one of the factor grows really big while the other gets really small and I guess they tend to take each other out, so it's pretty clear it shouldn't approach 0, but I don't think it's clear that it should approach $\frac{1}{2}$ either.

Then the subsequence $\{x_{n_j}\}_j$ corresponding to these peaks is monotonically decreasing, and we are done. So suppose now that there are only finitely many peaks, let $N$ be the last peak and set $n_1 = N + 1$ . Then $n_1$ is not a peak, since $n_1 > N$ , which implies the existence of an $n_2 > n_1$ with $x_{n_2} \geq x_{n_1}.$ Again, as $n_2 > N$ it is not a peak, hence there is $n_3 > n_2$ with $x_{n_3} \geq x_{n_2}.$ Repeating this process leads to an infinite non-decreasing subsequence $x_{n_1} \leq x_{n_2} \leq x_{n_3} \leq \ldots$ as desired. In the second case, if $n_1$ is not a peak, how does this imply the existence of an $n_2 > n_1$ with $x_{n_2} \geq x_{n_1}$ ? Can't it be possible that there does not exist any $n_2 > n_1$ such that $x_{n_2} \geq x_{n_1}$ ? A possible example can be the sequence $\{\sin n\}_n$ , taking $N$ to be the closest integer to $\pi/2$","Consider the following proof that every sequence in has a monotone subsequence. Proof: Let us call a positive integer a peak of the sequence if i.e., if is greater than every subsequent term in the sequence. Suppose first that the sequence has infinitely many peaks, .

I understand the definition of a Cauchy sequence; however, I'm not sure how to find the necessary value of N to satisfy the prove. I know that you can simply proof that the sequence is Cauchy by stating that it converges to 2. But, for this specific problem we are asked to use strictly the definition of a Cauchy sequence in writing the proof. Thanks for the help in advance.","Prove that sequence {(2n+1)/n} is Cauchy.
