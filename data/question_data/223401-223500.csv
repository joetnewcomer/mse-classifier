1,Zariski tangent spaces over residue fields,Zariski tangent spaces over residue fields,,"I came up with the following question while looking at the definition of Zariski tangent spaces. Let $R$ be a noetherian ring, and let $\mathfrak{m}\subset R$ be a maximal ideal. Write $k:=R/\mathfrak{m}$ as the residue field. Denote by $\tilde{\mathfrak{m}}$ the unique maximal ideal in the local ring $R_\mathfrak{m}$ . Then it is well known that $R_\mathfrak{m}/\tilde{\mathfrak{m}}$ is canonically isomorphic to $k$ . Hence, both $\mathfrak{m}/\mathfrak{m}^2$ and $\tilde{\mathfrak{m}}/\tilde{\mathfrak{m}}^2$ have canonical structures as $k$ -vector spaces.

2,What geometry is preserved by the translation maps on elliptic curves?,What geometry is preserved by the translation maps on elliptic curves?,,"Let $E$ be an elliptic curve (over some field).  For any $P \in E$ , there is a translation map $T_P: E \to E$ given by $Q \mapsto P+Q$ .

To what extent does the birationality of the translation maps tell us that the geometry of the curve at one point is the same as its geometry at any other point of the curve?

7,Why doesn't this argument prove every nonsingular curve embeds into the projective plane?,Why doesn't this argument prove every nonsingular curve embeds into the projective plane?,,"It is a statement that some curves can never be embedded in the plane, but only in projective 3-space. Why does the following argument not prove that every nonsingular curve can be embedded in the projective plane, though? Let $X$ be a nonsingular complete curve over an algebraically closed field $k$ , with function field $F.$ We prove that $X$ can be embedded in $\mathbb{P}^2_k.$ $F$ has transcendence degree 1 over $k,$ and so we may find some $x \in F$ so that $F/k(x)$ is an algebraic extension. In fact, since $F$ is finite type over $k,$ $F/k(x)$ is even a finite extension. As $F/k(x)$ is a finite extension, and as $k(x)$ is separable, we deduce that $F/k(x)$ is a finite separable extension. The primitive element theorem then tells us that $F = k(x, y)$ for some $y \in F.$ Let $P \in k(x)[T]$ denote the monic minimal polynomial of $y$ over $k(x).$ Then $P(y) = 0$ looks like some polynomial equation $$y^n + f_{n-1}(x)y^{n-1} + \cdots + f_0(x) = 0,$$ where each $f_i\in k(x).$ Clearing denominators, we find that there is some polynomial $Q \in k[T_1, T_2]$ so that $Q(x,y) = 0.$ Let $X'$ denote the subscheme of $\mathbb{P}^2$ cut out by $Q$ . In the standard affine chart, $X'$ looks like $\operatorname{Spec} k[T_1, T_2]/(Q).$ The fraction field of the ring $k[T_1, T_2]/(Q)$ is just $F.$ Thus $X'$ is a projective curve with fraction field $F,$ implying it is isomorphic to $X.$ Where does this argument go wrong? I can think of two possible problems. In step 4, is it possible that $X'$ is a singular curve? Also in step 4, is it possible that $F$ is not isomorphic to the field of fractions of $k[T_1, T_2]/(Q)?$ I don't have any indication of why either 1 or 2 would fail; maybe someone could clarify if these are the problem, or if there was something else I missed?","It is a statement that some curves can never be embedded in the plane, but only in projective 3-space.

Below I will show an outline of the proof presented in the link above (just the topics) and be more detailed in the part that I didn't get. Outline of proof.

After this, Tao continues: Finally, let $l$ be the line that goes through the points $A_1,A_2$ and let $\sigma$ be the quadric curve that goes through $A_3,\dots,A_7.$ Note that the quadric curve must be a conic section based on $4.$ Even more, from $4.$ It also follows that $A_8 \notin l$ and $A_8 \notin \sigma.$ Now let us consider two points $B,C$ that are in $l$ but not in $\sigma.$ We can construct $Q = aP + bP_0 + cP_\infty$ such that $Q$ vanishes in $B$ and $C$ . Furthermore, $Q$ vanishes in $4$ points of $l$ $(B,C,A_1,A_2)$ and thus $l$ must be a component of $Q$ (Bézout). The other component must be a quadric curve (degree comparasion). Also, this quadric curve must contain the points $A_3,\dots,A_7$ and thus it must be $\sigma$ , based on $3.$ But then $Q$ doesn't vanish at $A_8$ , which is a contradiction, because $A_8$ vanishes at the three polynomials $P$ , $P_0$ and $P_\infty$ .

11,Is Pappus's theorem really a particular case of Pascal's theorem?,Is Pappus's theorem really a particular case of Pascal's theorem?,,"I am currently studying Bézout's theorem for projective plane curves and its applications. Amid this study, I came across the very famous Pascal's and Pappus's theorems. I was able to prove Pascal's theorem; as for Pappus's theorem, most of the authors I've read/watched state that this is just a particular case of Pascal's theorem, but I can't understand how. The formulation of Pascal's theorem (according to this class notes from Andreas Gathmann ) is: Pascal's theorem. Let $F$ be an irreducible conic over an algebraically closed field. Pick six distinct points $P_1,\dots,P_6$ on $F$ (that can be thought of as the vertices of a hexagon inscribed in $F$ ). Then the three intersection points of the opposite edges of the hexagon (i.e., $P = \overline{P_1P_2} \cap \overline{P_4P_5}$ , $Q = \overline{P_2P_3} \cap \overline{P_5P_6}$ and $R = \overline{P_3P_4} \cap \overline{P_6P_1}$ ) are colinear (all of this lie on a line). Notice that the author restricts this to irreducible conics and this fact is indeed used in the proof (every other proof that I found using Bézout's theorem also uses this fact, even though some don't mention it (?)). As for Pappus's theorem, it is formulated as follows: Pappus's theorem. Let $A,B,C$ be three points on a straight line and let $X,Y,Z$ be three points on another line. If the lines $\overline{AY},\overline{BZ},\overline{CX}$ intersect the lines $\overline{BX},\overline{CY},\overline{AZ}$ respectively, then the three points of the intersection are colinear. To prove this theorem, I was watching this really cool video from Zvi Rosen . Here, he says that Pappus's theorem is just a particular case of Pascal's theorem because obviously the union of two lines form a conic and then one can apply Pascal's theorem. Note that in this video Rosen stated Pascal's theorem without the word irreducible so it made sense to him to apply it directly, but in the proof of Pascal's theorem, he used the fact that the conic $F$ is irreducible. In fact, his proof follows exactly the same logic as the class notes linked above, from Gathmann. My concern is that although the union of two lines forms a conic, this conic is reducible and thus one can't apply Pascal's theorem so directly (at least, in my point of view). So, am I missing something here or we really can't apply the Pascal Theorem to prove the Pappus's theorem? If we can't apply it, how would one prove Pappus's Theorem using Bézout's theorem? Thanks for any help in advance.","I am currently studying Bézout's theorem for projective plane curves and its applications. Amid this study, I came across the very famous Pascal's and Pappus's theorems. I was able to prove Pascal's theorem; as for Pappus's theorem, most of the authors I've read/watched state that this is just a particular case of Pascal's theorem, but I can't understand how. The formulation of Pascal's theorem (according to this class notes from Andreas Gathmann ) is: Pascal's theorem. Let be an irreducible conic over an algebraically closed field. Pick six distinct points on (that can be thought of as the vertices of a hexagon inscribed in ). Then the three intersection points of the opposite edges of the hexagon (i.e., , and ) are colinear (all of this lie on a line). Notice that the author restricts this to irreducible conics and this fact is indeed used in the proof (every other proof that I found using Bézout's theorem also uses this fact, even though some don't mention it (?)). As for Pappus's theorem, it is formulated as follows: Pappus's theorem. Let be three points on a straight line and let be three points on another line. If the lines intersect the lines respectively, then the three points of the intersection are colinear. To prove this theorem, I was watching this really cool video from Zvi Rosen . Here, he says that Pappus's theorem is just a particular case of Pascal's theorem because obviously the union of two lines form a conic and then one can apply Pascal's theorem. Note that in this video Rosen stated Pascal's theorem without the word irreducible so it made sense to him to apply it directly, but in the proof of Pascal's theorem, he used the fact that the conic is irreducible.

17,Krull dimension vs. Dimension in Zariski topology for a field that is not algebraically closed,Krull dimension vs. Dimension in Zariski topology for a field that is not algebraically closed,,"I'm new to algebraic geometry and struggle with the notion of the dimension of an affine variety. In Robin Hartshorne's book Algebraic Geometry the dimension is introduced using the Zariski topology: Definition: Let $X$ be a topological space, we define its dimension as the supremum over all integers $n$ s.t. there exists an ascending chain of closed irreducible components (w.r.t. the topology) $Z_0 \subset Z_1 \subset \dots \subset Z_n\subseteq X$ . The dimension of an affine variety is then defined to be the dimension as its topological space. Then he shows that for an affine variety $V \subseteq K^n$ the Krull dimension of the coordinate ring $K[x]/\mathcal{I}(V)$ (defined as the supremum of heights of prime ideals) equals the dimension of $V$ as defined above. Question 1: My understanding is that Hartshorne assumes the field $K$ to be algebraically closed throughout the book and I'm wondering whether this particular result changes when using e.g. $K=\mathbb{R}$ . My understanding from quickly going through section 3.3 in https://perso.univ-rennes1.fr/michel.coste/polyens/SAG.pdf is that this should indeed hold. Can anyone help me out or ideally refer to some literature about this? Question 2: I stumbled upon the supposed counter-example $\mathcal{V}(\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2)\subseteq K^n$ , which I don't quite understand. My reasoning is as follows: Let $f=\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2\subseteq \mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ , then $V:=\mathcal{V}(f)\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n=\{(0,\dots,0)\}$ should have dimension 0 in the Zariski topology. The coordinate ring is given by $$ \mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]/\mathcal{I}(V) = \{[f]:f\in \mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]\} $$ with $g\in[f] \iff f-g\in \mathcal{I}(V)$ . Here we have that $h\in\mathcal{I}(V) \iff h(0,\dots,0)=0$ , which happens if the constant part of $h$ denoted by $a_0^h$ is zero (because $h(0,\dots,0)=a_0^h$ ). Thus, two polynomials are in the same equivalence class if they have the same constant part, i.e. $g\in[f] \iff a_0^g = a_0^f$ . Since $\forall f\in \mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n] : a^f_0\in\mathbb{R}$ we have $\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]/\mathcal{I}(V) =\mathbb{R}$ .

Here dimension is defined as the maximal length of an ascending chain of irreducible closed subsets, minus one. Hartshorne starts with the observation that dim $Y \le $ dim $\overline{Y}$ (a chain of irreducible closed subsets of $Y$ induces a chain of irreducible closed subsets of $\overline{Y}$ by taking closures). He then states that a maximal chain of such subsets of $Y$ induces a maximal chain of $\overline{Y}$ (this claim is not explicitly proven, but I think I have worked through the details).

Then $\chi_{\lambda} = \chi_{\mu}$ if and only if $\lambda \sim \mu$ . Notation issue : Let $L$ be a semisimple Lie algebra, $\mathcal{U}(L)$ be its universal enveloping algebra, $\mathcal{Z}(L)$ be the center of $\mathcal{U}(L)$ . Let $\lambda \in H^{\ast}$ . The action of $\mathcal{Z}(L)$ on the Verma module $Z(\lambda)$ of $L$ induces a central character (or called the infinitesimal character) $\chi_{\lambda} : \mathcal{Z}(L) \rightarrow \mathbb{F}$ . Linkage : We say $\lambda, \mu \in H^{\ast}$ are linked (written as $\lambda \sim \mu$ ) if $\lambda + \delta$ and $\mu + \delta$ are $\mathcal{W}$ -conjugate, where $\mathcal{W}$ is the Weyl group of the root system of $L$ (after the CSA $H$ is chosen). My two questions below are both related to understanding the notion of Linkage : Exercise 23.8 Prove that the weight lattice $\Lambda$ is Zariski dense in $H^{\ast}$ . Use this to prove the if part of the above quoted theorem. My question 1 is how to solve the above exercise? My attempt 1 : I have proved that the weight lattice $\Lambda$ is indeed Zariski dense by identifying $\Lambda$ with $\mathbb{Z}^{\ell}$ and $H^{\ast}$ with $\mathbb{C}^{\ell}$ . Then $\mathbb{Z}^{\ell}$ is indeed dense in $\mathbb{C}^{\ell}$ by noting $$ \overline{\mathbb{Z}^{\ell}} = Z(I(\mathbb{Z}^{\ell})) = Z(0) = \mathbb{C}^{\ell}. $$ But I got stuck on how to carry on to show $\chi_{\lambda} = \chi_{\mu}$ for linked $\lambda$ and $\mu$ . Here is another exercise in Humphrey: Exercise 23.6 : If $\Lambda \in \Lambda^{+}$ , prove that all $\mu$ linked to $\lambda$ satisfy $\mu \prec \lambda$ , hence that all such $\mu$ occurs as weights of $Z(\lambda)$ . My question 2 is how to show the ""hence that"" part? My attempts 2 : I have managed to show the first part: Since $\delta$ is strongly dominant, we see $\lambda + \delta$ is strongly dominant. Since $\mu$ is linked to $\lambda$ , $\mu + \delta$ is $\mathcal{W}$ -conjugate to $\lambda + \delta$ . Hence by Lemma 13.2A of Humphrey's book, $\mu + \delta \prec \lambda + \delta$ , and hence $\mu \prec \lambda$ . But I got stuck on the ""hence that"" part. It seems that this part is a direct corollary of $\mu \prec \lambda$ ? But I cannot figure it out, as I know few on the weights of the Verma module $Z(\lambda)$ . The only thing relevent that I can think of is Proposition 21.3 on the weights of $V(\lambda)$ , the irreducible highest weight representation. Is this related to the Harish-Chandra theorem quoted above? As the two are both related to the Linkage relation and the Verma module $Z(\lambda)$ , I listed the two questions in one post. Sorry for such a long post and thank you all for your answers and comments! EDIT after @Erica's hints on Question 2 : Following @Erica's hints on Question 2 , I have solved Exercise 21.4 in Humphrey's book using Lemma 21.2, this is also Proposition 23.2: Let $\lambda \in \Lambda, \alpha \in \Delta$ . If the integer $m = \langle \lambda, \alpha \rangle$ is nonnegative, then the coset of $y_{\alpha}^{m+1}$ in $Z(\lambda)$ is a maximal vector of weight $\lambda - (m+1)\alpha$ . So for any $\mu \prec \lambda$ , to show that $\mu$ is a weight of $Z(\lambda)$ , it suffices to find a simple root $\alpha \in \Delta$ such that $\mu = \lambda - (m+1)\alpha $ . In the proof of the Corollary 23.2, we have seen that $$\lambda - (m+1)\alpha = \sigma_{\alpha}(\lambda + \delta) - \delta.$$ So in other words, we shall find some simple reflection $\sigma_{\alpha} \in \mathcal{W}$ such that $\mu + \delta = \sigma_{\alpha}(\lambda + \delta)$ . But it seems that the only thing we know from the linkage of $\lambda$ and $\mu$ is that there exist $\sigma \in \mathcal{W}$ such that $\mu + \delta = \sigma(\lambda + \delta)$ , but how can we make $\sigma$ to be a simple reflection (i.e. $\sigma = \sigma_{\alpha}$ for some $\alpha \in \Delta$ )? Note that $\mathcal{W}$ is generated by simple reflections, we obtain $\sigma = \sigma_{\alpha_1} \cdots \sigma_{\alpha_r}$ for some $\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_r \in \Delta$ . But I got stuck here.

Why is the dimension of the linear system $|C|$ the genus of $C$ ?

Riemann-Roch on K3 surfaces is $$\chi(\mathcal{O}(C)) = \frac{1}{2} C^2 + 2,$$ and we can connect $C^2$ to the genus $g = g(C)$ using the adjunction formula, which on a K3 surface is $$2g - 2 = C^2.$$ Combining Riemann-Roch and the adjunction formula then leads to $$\chi(\mathcal{O}(C)) = g + 1,$$ so it remains to show $H^0(\mathcal{O}(C)) = \chi(\mathcal{O}(C))$ , i.e. $H^1(\mathcal{O}(C)) = 0 = H^2(\mathcal{O}(C))$ .

49,The Euler characteristic of a cubic Fermat surface,The Euler characteristic of a cubic Fermat surface,,"Let $F$ denote the cubic Fermat surface in $\mathbf{P}^3$ (everything is over the complex numbers): $$ F = \{ X^3 + Y^3 + Z^3 + W^3  = 0\}\subseteq \mathbf{P}^3.$$ I wish to compute the Euler characteristic of this variety. (It is known to be 9, but I'm more interested in the method.) The approach I want to take is using complex Morse theory via Lefschetz pencils, as outlined by e.g. Lamotke or Nicolaescu. For a given pencil of hyperplanes in $\mathbf{P}^N$ and $X$ a (smooth) variety of dimension $n$ in $\mathbf{P}^N$ , then we have a formula $$ \chi (X) = 2\chi(X_b) - \chi(B) + (-1)^n r$$ where $X_b$ is a generic hyperplane section, $B$ is the base locus (i.e., the intersection of all hyperplanes in the pencil with $X$ ), and $r$ is the number of singular sections of the pencil (i.e., the number of hyperplanes in the pencil which do not intersect $X$ in a smooth variety). I apply this to the pencil $$ \{ H_{[\lambda:\mu]}\}_{[\lambda:\mu]\in\mathbf{P}^1}, \qquad \text{where}\quad H_{[\lambda:\mu]} := \{ \lambda X + \mu Y = 0\}.$$ This is a Lefschetz pencil in the sense of Lamotke, and it is not difficult to see that $B$ is a discrete set of three points. A generic hyperplane section is just an elliptic curve, so that the above formula reduces to $$\chi(F) = r - 3.$$ So we are left to find the number of hyperplanes that intersect $F$ in a singular variety, and it is here that I end up making a mistake. Let me outline my approach. It is easy to see that $H_{[1:0]}$ is not one of the singular sections, so without loss of generality we may put $\mu=1$ . The intersection $F \cap H_{[\lambda:1]}$ then becomes $$ \{X^3 + Y^3 + Z^3 + W^3  = 0,\ \lambda X + Y = 0 \}.$$ The hyperplane $H_{[\lambda:1]}$ determines an embedding $\mathbf{P}^2 \to \mathbf{P}^3$ with image this hyperplane. This is an isomorphism onto its image, so studying this intersection is the same as studying the pullback of $F$ along this map, which is the variety $$ \{(1 -\lambda^3) X^3 + Z^3 + W^3  = 0\}\subseteq \mathbf{P}^2$$ where I have chosen to use coordinates $(X,Z,W)$ on $\mathbf{P}^2$ for obvious reasons. This is singular precisely when $\lambda^3 = 1$ , i.e., when $\lambda$ is a third root of unity. This would yield $r=3$ , so that $\chi(F) = 0$ , which is impossible. (Even if one doesn't know the Euler characteristic, one can easily compute all but the second homology groups of $F$ , and deduce that $\chi(F)$ must be at least 3.)

(I have showed that coherence of $\mathcal F$ implies coherence of $\mathrm{Ann}($$\mathcal F)$ .) The annihilator ideal sheaf is defined by $\Ann(\mathcal F)(U) = \{f\in O_X(U)|$ $f$ kills $\mathcal F|_U\} =$ $= \{f\in O_X(U)\mid \forall \text{ open } V\subset U$ $f|_V$ kills the $O_X(V)$ -module $\mathcal F(V)\}$ , for an open $U\subset X$ .

To $p$ corresponds a $d$-fold cyclic covering $\pi\colon X \to \mathbb P^1_{\mathbb C}$. Briefly speaking, my question is: How do I get/construct $X$? More precisely: To complete to a covering of $P^1_{\mathbb C}$, I should homogenize the equation $y^d = p(x)$, i.e., I get an equation $$y^d = \prod_{i=1}^n (x-b_iz)z^a$$ for some $a \in \mathbb Z$. Now, such a curve is singular, so I have to normalize it to make it smooth. From the theory of hyperelliptic curves I know that such a normalization lives in a weighted projective space. Concretely, if $d = 2, n = 2g+2, g \geq 2, a = 0$, the above equation gives a smooth curve in the weighted projective space $\mathbb P (x,y,z) = \mathbb P (1,g+1,1)$. Similary, if $d = 2, g \geq 2$ but $n = 2g+1$, I choose $a = 1$ and obtain again a smooth curve in $\mathbb P (1,g+1,1)$. I've always used this as a black-box, but now I want to understand if this is a principle of greater generality. So my questions are: Can a similar thing as for hyperelliptic curves be done in the greater generality described above? The next two questions assume that the answer to question 1 is positive, which I expect it to be. How do I choose $a$? When $a$ is chosen, is the normalization of the curve $\{y^d = \prod_{i=1}^n (x-b_iz)z^a\} \subset \mathbb P^2_{\mathbb C}$ obtained by the same equation in some weighted projective space? If so, what are the weights (I feel like $x$ and $z$ should have the same weights)?

Now, such a curve is singular, so I have to normalize it to make it smooth. From the theory of hyperelliptic curves I know that such a normalization lives in a weighted projective space. Concretely, if $d = 2, n = 2g+2, g \geq 2, a = 0$, the above equation gives a smooth curve in the weighted projective space $\mathbb P (x,y,z) = \mathbb P (1,g+1,1)$. Similary, if $d = 2, g \geq 2$ but $n = 2g+1$, I choose $a = 1$ and obtain again a smooth curve in $\mathbb P (1,g+1,1)$. I've always used this as a black-box, but now I want to understand if this is a principle of greater generality. So my questions are: Can a similar thing as for hyperelliptic curves be done in the greater generality described above? The next two questions assume that the answer to question 1 is positive, which I expect it to be. How do I choose $a$? When $a$ is chosen, is the normalization of the curve $\{y^d = \prod_{i=1}^n (x-b_iz)z^a\} \subset \mathbb P^2_{\mathbb C}$ obtained by the same equation in some weighted projective space? If so, what are the weights (I feel like $x$ and $z$ should have the same weights)?

I'm not looking for a fully detailed proof, some comments highlighting the main points of it would be great and much appreciated.","Y E Y E\to\det E E E\to\mathcal{O}_Y Z\subset Y Y Y H^1(\mathcal{O}_Y)=0 Z\in Hilb \mathcal{M} Z\subset Y H^0(Z,N_{Z|Y}) E \operatorname{Ext}^1(E,E) H^1(\mathcal{O}_Y)=0 H^1(\mathcal{O}_Y)=0","['algebraic-geometry', 'moduli-space']"

I did find two solutions available via google, but was skeptical of both. This is Exercise 21 - i) from Chapter 3 of Introduction to Commutative Algebra by M.F. Atiyah and I.G. Macdonald. The exercise states: Let $A$ be a ring, $S$ be a multiplicatively closed subset of $A$, and $\phi \colon A \to S^{-1}A$ the canonical homomorphism. Show that $\phi^{*} \colon \mathrm{Spec}(S^{-1}A) \to \mathrm{Spec}(A)$ is a homeomorphism of $\mathrm{Spec}(S^{-1}A)$ onto its image in $X = \mathrm{Spec}(A)$. Let this image be denoted by $S^{-1}X$. I am satisfied with 3/4'ths of my solution. Namely, we know that $\phi^{*}$ is continuous by Exercise 21 - i, Chapter 1 . We also know this restriction mapping is surjective, trivially. Further $\phi^{*}$ is injective by applying Exercise 20 - ii, Chapter 3 that every prime ideal of $S^{-1}A$ being an extended ideal is a sufficient condition for infectivity. We know the hypothesis that every prime ideal of $S^{-1}A$ is extended is satisfied since Proposition 3.11 - iv) gives a bijective correspondence, $\mathfrak{p} \longleftrightarrow S^{-1}\mathfrak{p},$ where $\mathfrak{p}$ are the prime ideals of $A$ that don't meet $S$ and $S^{-1}\mathfrak{p}$ represents $\mathfrak{p}^{e}$, thus every prime ideal in the localization is extended. My issue is with the final step, showing that the inverse map is continuous. To be honest, I have been struggling to decided what precisely the rule defining the inverse function would be? I believe it is simply the action of $\phi$? I decided to follow the same outline for how this text had us show that $\phi^{*}$ it self was continuous, so here is the proof I came up with. I am very skeptical however as I don't believe I am using the follow power of my hypothesis: Proof: To show ${\phi^{*}}^{-1}$ is continuous we show ${\phi^{*-1}}^{-1}(X_{f}) = Y_{\phi^{-1}(f)}$, apologies for the atrocious notation on the left hand side, I simply mean the pullback of the open basis set $X_f$ in $\mathrm{Spec}(S^{-1}A)$ under the inverse of $\phi^{*}$. If successful this obviously satisfies the usual topological definition of continuity since $Y_{\phi^{-1}(f)}$ is open in $S^{-1}X \subseteq \mathrm{Spec}(A).$ The argument is $$\mathfrak{p} \in {\phi^{*-1}}^{-1}(X_{f}) \iff \phi^{*-1}(\mathfrak{p})\in X_{f}$$ $$\iff \phi(\mathfrak{p}) \in X_{f}$$ but since $\mathfrak{p}$ is some contracted ideal, $\phi(\mathfrak{p})$ is just some $\mathfrak{q}$ in $S^{-1}X$, then $$\iff f \notin \phi(\mathfrak{p})$$ $$\iff \phi^{-1}(f) \notin \mathfrak{p}$$ $$\iff \mathfrak{p} \in Y_{\phi^{-1}(f)}.$$","I checked if anything on this questions exists on MSE, but I found nothing.

98,Motivation for orbifold base points,Motivation for orbifold base points,,"I have been reading Hain's notes Lectures on Moduli Spaces of Elliptic Curves , and would like some ""philosophical"" intuition on the definition of orbifold basepoints. Let $X$ be a simply connected topological space, and let $\Gamma$ be a discrete group acting on $X$. We denote by $\Gamma\backslash\backslash X$ the corresponding (basic) orbifold . The space $X$ can be regarded as the orbifold $1\backslash\backslash X$ under the action of the trivial group. On p.18 Hain says that the natural orbifold ""universal covering"" map $p:X\to\Gamma\backslash\backslash X$ should be regarded as a base point of the orbifold $\Gamma\backslash\backslash X$. I understand how pointed morphims of orbifolds (Defintion 3.1) preserve such ""base points"", but I was wondering: is there an intuitive reason for calling such a map a base point of the orbifold? For example, we can look at the analogy with geometric base points in algebraic geometry. By definition a geometric base point of a scheme $X$ is a morphism $\text{Spec}(\bar{k})\to X$ where $\bar{k}$ is an algebraically  closed field. Now in the theory of the etale fundamental group, the universal cover of $\text{Spec}(k)$ (for $k$ perfect, at least) is $$\text{Spec}(\bar{k})\to\text{Spec}(k),$$ induced by the choice of an embedding $k\hookrightarrow\bar{k}$. So in this case a base point of $\text{Spec}(k)$ is the same as a universal cover. But this doesn't generalise to schemes of higher dimension. To motivate the above idea for orbifolds, therefore, I am wondering: are there any other analogies/results in geometry or topology where regarding the universal cover of a space as an abstract base point makes sense? Perhaps such a thing comes from the worlds of stacks/topoi? Or is this just a convenient notation?","I have been reading Hain's notes Lectures on Moduli Spaces of Elliptic Curves , and would like some ""philosophical"" intuition on the definition of orbifold basepoints.
