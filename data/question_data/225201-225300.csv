0,Multiplicity of finite modules,Multiplicity of finite modules,,"Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field. In the discussion of Bezout's theorem, the following definiton of multiplicity has been given: Definition. Let $R$ be a noetherian graded $k$ -algebra and $M$ a finitely generated $R$ -module. The multiplicity $\mu_{\mathfrak{p}}$ of $M$ at a prime ideal $\mathfrak{p} \subset R$ is defined as the length $l$ of $M_{\mathfrak{p}} = M \otimes_R R_\mathfrak{p}$ as $R_{\mathfrak{p}}$ -module. I have trouble understanding the definition: Why do we want our ring and module to be graded? I do not see why this is essential (or 'needed'). I tried to work out the following special case: If $(R, \mathfrak{m})$ is local and noetherian with residue field $K = R/\mathfrak{m}$ , then $R \cong R_\mathfrak{p}$ and $M \cong M_\mathfrak{p}$ . So, $\mu_{\mathfrak{p}}(M)$ is finite if and only if $\mathfrak{m}^d M = 0$ for some $d$ . Indeed, $$M \supset \mathfrak{m}M \supset \mathfrak{m}^2M \supset \cdots \supset \mathfrak{m}^s M$$ gives a composition series and, $M$ has finite length if and only if this composition series is finite, that is $\mathfrak{m}^s M = 0$ for some $s \in \mathbb{N}$ . What confuses me is the following: In this case, the lectures notes define $$\mu_\mathfrak{m}(M) := \dim_K(M \otimes_R K),$$ but $M \otimes_R K \cong M/\mathfrak{m}M$ , and this is a $K$ -vector space of dimension one. So, the multiplicity of $M$ over a local ring is always one? This seems rather unlikely to me. Where is the reasoning error? (See Edit below) How does this capture the geometric intuition of multiplicity? I am trying to understand how one comes up with this definition, and usually going from geometry backwards seems helpful. Here is my attempt: For simplicity, let $X = \mathbb{A}^2$ be the affine plane and $R = A(\mathbb{A}^2) \cong k[x,y]$ the coordinate ring. Suppose $p \in X$ , corresponding to the maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}_p \subset k[x,y]$ . Then, $R_{\mathfrak{m}_p} \cong \mathcal{O}_{X,p}$ . Now, assume we have $f,g \in \mathcal{O}_{X,p}$ which cut out two curves $C_1 = Z(f)$ and $C_2 = Z(g)$ in the plane and $f(p) = g(p) = 0$ . That is, $f,g$ belong to the unique maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}_{X,p}$ of $\mathcal{O}_{X,p}$ . At this point, I am not completely sure how to continue and what the ' $M$ ' should be. Does it make sense to set $M: = \mathcal{O}_{X,p}/I$ for $I = (f,g)$ ? This is a finitely generated $R$ -module, and in fact, it has vector space structure over $\mathcal{O}_{X,p}/\mathfrak{m}_{X,p}$ if we assumed that $I$ is $\mathfrak{m}_{X,p}$ -primary. But what do we gain by setting $f$ and $g$ to zero? If this is the approach to pursue, why does the dimension of this vector space correspond to the multiplicity in the sense of order of vanishing? This still remains in the dark, from my point of view. Note: Please assume no scheme theory knowledge in your answer. Edit: I realized that $\dim_K(M/\mathfrak{m}M)$ is not necessarily one-dimensional, but finite, since $M$ is a finite module. But then the asserted chain of submodules is not a composition series. So, one should possibly argue follows: $M/\mathfrak{m}M$ has finite length and from $$ l_R(M/\mathfrak{m}M) + l_R(\mathfrak{m}M) = l_R(M), $$ we get that $M$ has finite length if and only if $\mathfrak{m}M$ has finite length.","Let be an algebraically closed field.

(a) For any divisor $D=\sum n_{i} P_{i}$ on $X$ , let $\psi(D)=\sum n_{i} \gamma\left(k\left(P_{i}\right)\right) \in K(X)$ , where $k\left(P_{i}\right)$ is the skyscraper sheaf $k$ at $P_{i}$ and 0 elsewhere.

First of all, since $Z$ is closed, it's something of the form $V(f_1,\ldots)$ . Now we want to see if a particular $p\in \text{Spec} A$ is also in $\pi(Z)$ . Now $p$ is in this image iff there's some $p'$ in each affine open $U_j = \text {Spec }A[x_0/x_j,\ldots,x_n/x_j]$ , which as a prime ideal contracts to $p$ under the usual map of rings produced in the opposite direction. Since we're interested in only primes that contract to $p$ , we may ""throw out"" everything else by working only with $k(p)[x_0/x_j,\ldots,x_n/x_j]$ in each of these cases, and as a result, we may just work with $Proj_{\bullet} k(p)[x_0,\ldots,x_n]$ . If there is a point $q$ at which the images of the $f_i$ vanish then there's a corresponding prime ideal which contracts to $p$ via the corresponding map of rings, and thus $p\in \pi(Z)$ .

In this case, we can't simply add the two generating polynomials to obtain $f$ as we could in the unstated cases. As it turns out, $x^2+y^2+1 = 0 \Rightarrow b+d=1$ and $y^2+d = -x^2-(1-d)$ , so $\mathfrak{m} = (x^2+b)$ is principal (no surprise as $A$ is a UFD and a Dedekind domain). Furthermore, it factors as $x^2+b = (\sqrt{d}x+\sqrt{b}y)(\sqrt{d}x-\sqrt{b}y)$ , and, since $\mathfrak{m}$ is prime, one of those linear factors is contained in, and therefore generates, $\mathfrak{m}$ . My problem: This is one of those, ""even if it's true, I have to see it with my own eyes"" deals.

32,Defining localization of modules through universal property,Defining localization of modules through universal property,,"On page 33 of Vakil's book on Algebraic Geometry, he shows how one can define the localization of modules purely in terms of universal property and later shows that a specific definition satisfies the property. Basically he says that if $M$ is an $A$ -module and $S$ a multiplicative subset of $A$ , define a map $\phi:M\rightarrow S^{-1}M$ as being initial among $A$ -module maps $M\rightarrow N$ such that all elements of $S$ are invertible in $N$ i.e. $s\times\cdot: N\rightarrow N$ is an isomorphism for all $s$ . So far, so good. However, he then proceeds to make two assertions which confuse me: (i) The definition determines $\phi:M\rightarrow S^{-1}M$ up to unique isomorphism. (ii) By definition, $S^{-1}M$ can be extended to a $S^{-1}A$ -module. I tried to prove the first one by first assuming that there's another map $\psi:M\rightarrow B$ that also satisfies the universal property. I was tempted to then say, by the universal property defined, that there is a unique map from $f:B\rightarrow S^{-1}M$ such that $\phi = f\circ \psi$ . However, I have no way of knowing that elements of S are invertible in $S^{-1}M$ . Do note that we haven't explicitly defined $S^{-1}M$ yet and so we can't conclude that elements in $S$ are invertible in $S^{-1}M$ The second assertion is related to the first one. How does one conclude from the definition that $S^{-1}M$ can be extended to form a $S^{-1}A$ -module? I tried using the invertibility of $S$ in $N$ or choosing a specific $N$ but invertibility in $N$ says nothing about invertibility in $S^{-1}M$ and choosing a specific $N$ (localized module $M$ according to the actual definition for instance) seems like cheating since we're supposed to get the assertion purely via universal property.

For starters a generalization to $n$-dimensional tori seems reasonable (edit : apparently it isn't !). More generally, having ""many"" such functions could be a necessary condition. In our case we have the happy accident of the Weirestrass function but I suspect the general case to be much messier.

How does one show that $\mathcal{O}(X) \cong k[x, y]$? I am more or less aware of how to do this from a sheaf-theoretic point of view: the distinguished opens are $D(x)$ and $D(y)$, and the regular functions on these are simply elements of $k[x, y]_x$ and $k[x, y]_y$, so a regular function is a function which agrees on the overlap, and thus has no power of $x$ or $y$ in the denominator, i.e. is an element of $k[x, y]$. Can this proof be translated to the classical point of view? In particular, how does one assert that the regular functions on a ""distinguished open set $D(f)$"" are simply the polynomials localized at $f$ -- the rest will be the same after this.","Let $k$ be algebraically closed and consider $X = \mathbb{A}^2 \setminus O$.
