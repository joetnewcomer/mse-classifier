(I do not teach set theory in my course.) Because I did not study mathematics, and because I want to make everything as correct as possible, I spend a lot of time researching the terms and concepts of set theory, but I found, that many terms and concepts are explained not just only in different ways, but also contradictory.

I also are not sure, if this is a synonym for relation or for function or for something else. I am pretty sure, that every subset of the Cartesian product is a relation . I found Definitions of ""Abbildung"" that say that every subset of the Cartesian product is an ""Abbildung"" (which would make it a synonym for relation ).

So we have that either $a\equiv b\equiv 0mod3$ , $c\equiv 1or2mod3$ or any of its permutations hold true.
