Problem: Prove that if $\{a^k\}_{k=0}^\infty$ is a sequence of points in $H^\infty$ which converges to $a=\{a_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty} \in H^\infty$, then $\lim_{k \to \infty} a_j^k = a_j$ for all $j \in \mathbb{N}$. Proof: Let $j\in \mathbb{N}$ and $\epsilon > 0$. Since $\lim_{k \to \infty} \{a^k\}=a,$ there exists $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $k \geq N$ implies that $$d(a^k,a) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{|a^k_n-a_n|}{2^n} < \frac{\epsilon}{2^j}.$$ We also have $$\frac{|a^k_j-a_j|}{2^j} < \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{|a^k_n-a_n|}{2^n} < \frac{\epsilon}{2^j},$$ which implies that $|a^k_j-a_j| < \epsilon$, so $\lim_{k \to \infty} a_j^k = a_j$ for all $j \in \mathbb{N}$. My confusion: I don't feel good about the fact that $N$ depends on $j$... but maybe this is OK. How does the proof look?","I am having trouble convincing myself that the following proof is correct. The question is from the exercies in a real analysis book and the section is on sequences in metric spaces. Background: Let $(H^\infty,d)$ be a metric space such that $H^\infty \subset \mathbb{R}^\infty$ and if $\{a_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty} \in H^\infty$, then $|a_n| \leq 1$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. In other words, $H^\infty$ is ""Hilbert's cube."" The metric $d$ in this case is defined by $d(a,b)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{|a_n-b_n|}{2^n}$. Problem: Prove that if $\{a^k\}_{k=0}^\infty$ is a sequence of points in $H^\infty$ which converges to $a=\{a_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty} \in H^\infty$, then $\lim_{k \to \infty} a_j^k = a_j$ for all $j \in \mathbb{N}$. Proof: Let $j\in \mathbb{N}$ and $\epsilon > 0$. Since $\lim_{k \to \infty} \{a^k\}=a,$ there exists $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $k \geq N$ implies that $$d(a^k,a) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{|a^k_n-a_n|}{2^n} < \frac{\epsilon}{2^j}.$$ We also have $$\frac{|a^k_j-a_j|}{2^j} < \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{|a^k_n-a_n|}{2^n} < \frac{\epsilon}{2^j},$$ which implies that $|a^k_j-a_j| < \epsilon$, so $\lim_{k \to \infty} a_j^k = a_j$ for all $j \in \mathbb{N}$.

You can stop the process any time you wish, at which point your score is the last value rolled. What is your expected score as a function of N, assuming optimal play? The answer is found recursively: For N=1 the answer is 3.5. For larger N the answer for N-1 determines whether to stop after the first roll, from which we can calculate the answer for N. Now consider just that first roll. Obviously if the first roll is a 6, you stop. Suppose the first roll is 5. Do you stop? The answer depends on N. Clearly for N=2 you stop if 5 is the first roll, and just as clearly you do not stop on an initial 5 if N is very large, because you're so likely to get a 6 eventually. How large must N be so that you will stop on the first roll only if that roll is 6? The answer is 6. That is, if the first roll is 5 you should stop if N<=5 and continue if N>=6.

State such an $f$ and $a$ in this case. $$\lim_{h \ \to \  0} \frac{\sqrt{9+h}-3}{h}$$ Now this type of problem is slightly unique. In general we can always find a function based on it's derivative by taking the indefinite integral of the derivative, however in this case we don't have the derivative in a general form, we only have the value for the derivative function at some point $a$, and there are a large number of $f$'s which can produce the value for the derivative at that point. Am I correct in saying this? This problem above is easily solvable, anyone can see already that the function is obviously going to be $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$, but the way I seem to solve it is a very heuristic method, which bothers me greatly (i.e. similar to guessing a function and working from there). I'm trying to find a methodical way of solving problems of this type, as the way I solve it (shown below) will definitely break down for harder examples. This is my solution : By the definition of a derivative : $$f'(x) = \lim_{h \to\ 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$$ In the above case we can see that $\ f(a+h) = \sqrt{9+h}\ $ and $\ f(a)=3 = \sqrt{9}$ This implies that $a = 9$ and $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ or written more formally ($f : x \to \sqrt{x}, \ \forall x\in\mathbb{R^{+}}$) As you can see that is a very hap-hazard solution, and I would like to find a better way to solve problems of these types, but it eludes me. Is there a more methodical approach (or formal approach) to solving problems of this type, where we are given a limit representing the derivative of some real-valued function $f$ at some real-number $a$, and asked to find $f$ and $a$? If you have any other suggestions for solving these types of problems, please comment below.","My question revolves around finding a function based on its derivative of the type below : Problem : The limit below represents the derivative of some real-valued function $f$ at some real-number $a$. State such an $f$ and $a$ in this case. $$\lim_{h \ \to \  0} \frac{\sqrt{9+h}-3}{h}$$ Now this type of problem is slightly unique. In general we can always find a function based on it's derivative by taking the indefinite integral of the derivative, however in this case we don't have the derivative in a general form, we only have the value for the derivative function at some point $a$, and there are a large number of $f$'s which can produce the value for the derivative at that point. Am I correct in saying this? This problem above is easily solvable, anyone can see already that the function is obviously going to be $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$, but the way I seem to solve it is a very heuristic method, which bothers me greatly (i.e. similar to guessing a function and working from there). I'm trying to find a methodical way of solving problems of this type, as the way I solve it (shown below) will definitely break down for harder examples. This is my solution : By the definition of a derivative : $$f'(x) = \lim_{h \to\ 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$$ In the above case we can see that $\ f(a+h) = \sqrt{9+h}\ $ and $\ f(a)=3 = \sqrt{9}$ This implies that $a = 9$ and $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ or written more formally ($f : x \to \sqrt{x}, \ \forall x\in\mathbb{R^{+}}$) As you can see that is a very hap-hazard solution, and I would like to find a better way to solve problems of these types, but it eludes me. Is there a more methodical approach (or formal approach) to solving problems of this type, where we are given a limit representing the derivative of some real-valued function $f$ at some real-number $a$, and asked to find $f$ and $a$?

PS The present question and this one are NOT duplicates, because that one focuses on continuity and this one focuses on differentiability. I thought I had made that clear in this question, but evidently it is not that clear since this question has been marked as a possible duplicate of the continuity one.",,"['limits', 'multivariable-calculus', 'differential']"

99,If $\lim\limits_{x\to b^-} f(x)=\infty$ Then $\lim\limits_{x\to b^-}f'(x)=\infty $,If  Then,\lim\limits_{x\to b^-} f(x)=\infty \lim\limits_{x\to b^-}f'(x)=\infty ,"Here's my question: Let $f$ be a continuous function in $[a,b)$ (semi closed interval) which is differentiable twice in $(a,b)$ , such that $f''(x)>0$ for all $x\in(a,b)$ . Prove that $$\lim_{x\to b^-}f(x)=\infty \Rightarrow \lim_{x\to b^-}f'(x)=\infty$$ In the question I have a hint: With the mean value theorem prove that if $f'$ is bounded then $f$ is bounded. Actually I didn't have much success with the hint. Instead, my claim is that if $f'$ is bounded, then $f$ is uniformly continuous (I can prove that), and then its limit is finite, which is a contradiction to the assumption of infinite limit. I don't know if I'm right. How can I use the hint? can I use my solution? Thanks, Alan","Here's my question: Let be a continuous function in (semi closed interval) which is differentiable twice in , such that for all .
