I tried the following, but the equation I got is very far from $\frac{dr}{d\theta} = r$ . I rewrote $\partial_x$ in terms of $\partial_r$ and $\partial_\theta$ using the chain rule. Supposing $f = f(r,\theta)$ is a function of $r$ and $\theta$ , we should have: $$\begin{aligned} \partial_x f(r,\theta) &= (\partial_x r)\partial_r f + (\partial_x \theta)\partial_\theta f\\ &=\cos\theta\partial_r f + \left(\partial_x \arctan\frac ux\right) \partial_\theta f\\ &=\cos\theta\partial_r f + \left(\frac {1}{1+\theta^2}2\theta\frac{xu_x - u}{x^2}\right) \partial_\theta f.\end{aligned}$$ Thus: $$\begin{aligned} u_x &=\cos\theta\partial_r (r\sin\theta) + \left(\frac {1}{1+\theta^2}2\theta\frac{xu_x - u}{x^2}\right) \partial_\theta (r\sin\theta)\\ &=\cos\theta\sin\theta + \left(\frac {2\theta}{1+\theta^2}\frac{xu_x - u}{(r\cos\theta)^2}\right) (-r\cos\theta + r_\theta \sin\theta)\\ &=\cos\theta\sin\theta - \left(\frac {2\theta}{1+\theta^2}\frac{r(u_x\cos\theta - \sin\theta)}{r\cos\theta}\right) + \left(\frac {2\theta}{1+\theta^2}\frac{\cos\theta u_x - \sin\theta}{r\cos^2\theta}\right) r_\theta \sin\theta.\end{aligned}$$ Rearranging: $$\begin{aligned} u_x\left[1 + \frac{2\theta}{1+\theta^2}\left(1+\frac{r_\theta}{r}\tan\theta \right)\right] &= \cos\theta\sin\theta + \frac {2\theta}{1+\theta^2}\left(\tan\theta - \frac{r_\theta}{r}\tan^2\theta\right).\end{aligned}$$ So: $$ u_x = \frac{\cos\theta\sin\theta + \frac {2\theta}{1+\theta^2}\left(\tan\theta - \frac{r_\theta}{r}\tan^2\theta\right)}{1 + \frac{2\theta}{1+\theta^2}\left(1+\frac{r_\theta}{r}\tan\theta \right)}$$ Then, rewriting (1) as $u_x = \frac{x+u}{x-u}$ , I obtained: $$\frac{\cos\theta\sin\theta + \frac {2\theta}{1+\theta^2}\left(\tan\theta - \frac{r_\theta}{r}\tan^2\theta\right)}{1 + \frac{2\theta}{1+\theta^2}\left(1+\frac{r_\theta}{r}\tan\theta \right)}=\frac{\cos\theta+\sin\theta}{\cos\theta-\sin\theta}.$$","According to Peter Olver in his book “Applications of Lie Groups to Differential Equations”, p. 104, Example 2.32, the ODE: is transformed in polar coordinates with and to: How do I transform to the new coordinates?

In chapter 8 he shows a simple equation that is ""stiff"" in the ODE sense of the word. $$ u' = \lambda(u - \cos{t}) - \sin{t} $$ The solution is: $$ u(t) = e^{\lambda(t - t_0)}(\eta - cos(t_0)) + \cos{t} $$ So the ratio between $\lambda$ and the $\sin{t}$ will define the stiffness of the equation. That all makes sense. However, when I looked at the plot for this equation I could not understand what made it stiff?

The eigenvalues of the linearized system have non-zero real part, so linearization is inconclusive. I then plotted it in Python and some online tools to see what I should expect , and consistently saw a continuum of centers near the origin. I'm used to this signalling a Hamiltonian system, but it isn't here. Moreover, since the periodic orbits are not limit cycles, Poincaré-Bendixson theorem isn't useful to my knowledge. I'm thinking that there should be an invariant of the system that describes these orbits. That is, some $G(x, y)$ such that $\dot{G} = 0$ , or at least a (not strict) Lyapunov Function. But guessing the form is proving difficult. The orbits seem to collapse into circles near the origin, so I suspected that it would be something like: $$G(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 + f(x, y)$$ Where $f(x, y) = o(x^2 + y^2)$ . This will be positive in a neighborhood of the origin (excluding the origin).
