2,Limit of a sequence of algebraic structures,Limit of a sequence of algebraic structures,,"(Disclaimer: I'm a novice in algebra. I'm at Chapter 13 of this free online abstract algebra book.

I've been thinking about sequences of groups that, in some sense, appear to get closer and closer to some infinite group that has all of the previous groups as subgroups. For example, the sequence $$\mathbb Z_2,~~~ \mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_2,~~~ \mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_2,~~~ \dots$$ in a certain sense approaches the group $\mathbb Z_2^\infty$ (I'm not sure if it has a more common symbol) of infinite binary strings under the bitwise XOR operation. Similarly, the sequence $$S_1,~ S_2,~ S_3,~ \dots$$ approaches $S_\mathbb N$, the symmetric group on all natural numbers. So you could be silly and write: $\lim_{n \to \infty} S_n = S_\mathbb N$. Does the pattern I'm seeing make any sense? I'm interested to see if these ""sorta-limits"" can be given a more rigorous definition. Is there some way to define the ""distance"" between two groups, so that the usual definition 1 for sequences can apply to them, and do the above patterns work out under that definition?

We say $G$ is the direct limit of $G_i$ relative to $F_{ij}$. Take three groups $A$, $G_1$, $G_2$ and two homomorphisms $f_1 \colon A \to G_1$,  $f_1 \colon A \to G_2$. The amalgamated free product $G_1 \ast_A G_2$ is the direct limit of $A, G_1, G_2$ relative to $f_1, f_2$. Usually one defines the amalgamated free product with monomorphisms, however the next exercise shows that there isn't any difference between Serre's definition and the definition with monomorphisms. Take $G =G_1 \ast_A G_2$ relative to the above maps. Define subgroups $A^n$, $G_1^n$, $G_2^n$ recursively by the following conditions: $$ A^1 = \{ 1 \}, \quad G_1^1 = \{1 \}, \quad G_2^1= \{ 1 \} $$ $$ A^n = \text{subgroup generated by } f_1^{-1}(G_1^{n-1}) \text{ and } f_2^{-1}(G_2^{n-1}) $$ $$ G^n_i = \text{subgroup generated by } f_i(A^{n}) $$ Let $A^{\infty}$ and $G_i^{\infty}$ be the unions of $A^n$ and $G_i^n$ respectively. Now the exercise says to show that $f_i$ defines an injection $A / A^{\infty} \to G_i / G^{\infty}_i$ and that $G$ may be identified with the amalgam $G_1 / G_1^{\infty} \ast_{A / A^{\infty}} G_2 / G_2^{\infty}$. The question I have is: why are  $A^{\infty}$ and $G_i^{\infty}$ normal inside $A$ and $G_i$ respectively?

First note that whenever $\varphi \colon G \to H$ is a homomorphism and $S$ is a subgroup of $G$ then $\varphi^{-1}(\varphi(S)) = SK$ where $K$ is the kernel of $\varphi$. Set $K_1 = \mbox{ker}(f_1)$ and $K_2 = \mbox{ker}(f_2)$. Then $A^2 = \langle K_1, K_2 \rangle = K_1 K_2$ as $K_1$ and $K_2$ are normal. Then if $G^n_i$ are meant to be defined as it is, it follows that $G_1^2 = f_1(K_2)$ and $G_2^2 = f_2(K_1)$.

Thus, $G$ cannot have a cyclic subgroup of order $p^2$, and thus must be elementary abelian.

Moreover, if $\sigma \in G_a$ fixes $a \in B$ then $\sigma(B) \cap B \supseteq \{a\}$. Since $B$ is a block the only option is $\sigma(B)=B$. This gives $G_a \subseteq G_B$. (b) We first prove that the images $\sigma_i(B)$ are disjoint. For suppose $\sigma_i(B) \cap \sigma_j(B)$ is nonempty for $i \neq j$. Acting on this with $\sigma_i^{-1}$ gives that the intersection $B \cap (\sigma_i^{-1} \circ \sigma_j)(B)$ is nonempty. Since $B$ is a block we must have that $(\sigma_i^{-1} \circ \sigma_j)(B)=B$. Acting on this with $\sigma_i$ gives $\sigma_i(B)=\sigma_j(B)$ which is a contradiction, since the images are known to be distinct. We also need to show that the union of these images is $A$. Suppose by way of contradiction that there is some $a \in A$ with $a \notin \bigcup_{i=1}^n \sigma_i(B)=\bigcup_{\sigma \in G} \sigma(B)$. Since $G$ is transitive, we can find a permutation sending some $b \in B$ to $a$. It follows that $\sigma_0(B) \supseteq \sigma_0(\{b\})=\{a\}$, which is a contradiction. (c) We prove that there are no blocks $B$ of order 2. Suppose $B=\{i,j\}$ is such a block (and the remaining elements are $k,l$). The permutation $(i \; k)$ shows $B$ is not a block. We also prove that there are no blocks of order 3. Suppose $B=\{i,j,k\}$ is such a block. The permutation $(i \; l)$ shows that $B$ is not a block. Thus the only possible orders for a block $B \subseteq A=\{1,2,3,4\}$ are 1 or 4, and $S_4$ is primitive on $A$. Since $D_8$ acts on the set of unordered pairs of opposite vertices, we have that such a pair (for example $B=\{1,3\}$) is a block. This is because for any $g \in D_8$ we either have $g \cdot \{1,3\}=\{1,3\}=B$ or $g \cdot \{1,3\}=\{2,4\}$ is disjoint with $B$. (d) We prove both implications: Suppose for each $a \in A$, the only subgroups of $G$ containing $G_a$ are $G_a$ and $G$, and let $B \subseteq A$ be a block, and let $b$ be a point in that block. Part (a) establishes $G_B$ as a supergroup of $G_b$, and hence gives two possible cases: $G_B=G$. In that case, we claim that $B=A$, for if $B \subsetneq A$ there is some $b' \in B \setminus A$. Since $G$ is transitive, there is some permutation $\sigma \in G$ sending $b$ to $b'$. But that permutation doesn't fix $B$, which is a contradiction. $G_B=G_b$.

So, we let the group G with order 10 denote the symmetry group of a pentagon. A subset $H$ of $G$ is a subgroup $(H, *)$ to the group $(G, *)$ if and only if $(H,*)$ is a group. To determine how many subgroups there are, I can use the Lagrange's theorem which tells us that the subgroups of a group with order n have a order m such that $m | n$. By this theorem we get know that the group $G$ has 5 subgroups since the divisors m of 10 is $m=1,2,5,10$. The question is, how shall I sketch the lattice of subgroups? Shall I check every possible subset and then check if they are subgroups or is there a faster way? I know that the 10 symmetries are the identity element, 4 rotation and 5 reflections. We can see these operation of the transformation as permutation. The first transformation that rotates 72 degrees are the permutation (ABCDE), 144 degrees are the permutation (ABCDE)^2 etc. This permutation have the order 5 since if we rotate 5 times we will get the identity (""the original pentagon"") .

The key point is to replace the Dynkin coefficient corresponding to the eliminated node by the one corresponding to the extra node of the minus highest root. Thus, deforming the weight system of the given irrep with above replacement gives us the branching rules and the Cartan matrices for the subalgebra in the given irrep. For example, under the subgroup $SU(2)\times SU(2)\times SU(2) \Subset SO(7)$, we have the 8 dimensional irrep of SO(7)  deformed as $8 \rightarrow (1,2,2) + (2,1,2)$, see P33-34 LieART . To construct the explicit matrix representation, we define the coordinates for each simple roots in an orthonormal basis (Cartan-Weyl basis) and therefore the coordinates for the fundamental weights as well. Thus, the generators corresponding to Cartan matrices have its matrix entries as the coordinate of every weights. Now, my question is what are the fundamental weights for the deformed Dynkin diagram? Should I keep the old fundamental weights except the replaced one or the new fundamental weights are resolved from the deformed Dynkin diagram? Most importantly, what's the new fundamental weight corresponding to the extended root? I would also need help to reveal how generators of the subalgebra are in the subset of generators of the mother algebra. When I replace the Dynkin coefficient with the extended root, how could the corresponding Cartan matrix belong to linear combination of Cartan matrices of the mother algebra?

80,Proof about cubic $t$-transitive graphs,Proof about cubic -transitive graphs,t,"I am reading ""Algebraic Graph Theory"" by Norman Biggs (1974). On page 119, there is a proposition which says the following: Proposition 18.1: Let $[\alpha]$ be a $t$-arc in a cubic $t$-transitive graph $X$. Then   an automorphism of $X$ which fixes $[\alpha]$ must be the identity   automorphism. To understand the Proposition, and the proof, some definitions and lemmas are needed. A $t$-arc is defined as follows: A $t$-arc in a graph $X$ is an ordered set $[\alpha] =   (\alpha_0,\ldots, \alpha_t)$ of $t+1$ vertices in $V(X)$, such that    $\alpha_i \alpha_{i+1} \in E(X)$ and $\alpha_{i-1} \neq \alpha_{i+1}$    for $1 \leq i \leq t-1$. We can concatenate such arcs by the following definition If $[\alpha]$ is a $t$-arc in a graph $X$ and $[\beta]$ is a $s$-arc in $X$, then we use $[\alpha . \beta]$ to denote the $(t+s+1)$-arc  $(\alpha_0,\ldots,\alpha_t,\beta_0,\ldots,\beta_s)$, provided that $\alpha_t \beta_0 \in E(X)$, $\alpha_{t-1} \neq \beta_0$ and $\alpha_{t} \neq \beta_1$. We also need the term succesive arcs Let $[\alpha]$ and $[\beta]$ be any two $s$-arcs in a graph $X$. We say that $[\beta]$ is a successor of $[\alpha]$ if $\beta_i = \alpha_{i+1}$ $(0 \leq i \leq s-1)$. We also need a Lemma which states Lemma 17.4: Let $X$ be a connected graph in which the degree of each vertex is at least three. If $s \geq 1$ and $[\alpha],[\beta]$ are any two $s$-arcs in $X$, then there is a finite sequence $[\alpha^{(i)}]$ $(1  \leq i \leq l)$ of $s$-arcs in $X$ such that $[\alpha^{(1)}] = [\alpha]$, and $[\alpha^{(l)}] = [\beta]$, and $[\alpha^{(i+1)}]$ is a successor of $[\alpha^{(i)}]$ for $1 \leq i \leq s-1$. and at last a Theorem which says Theorem 17.5: Let $X$ be a connected graph, where all vertices in $V(X)$ are at least 3 and let $[\alpha]$ be a $t$-arc in $X$. Suppose the vertices adjacent to $\alpha_t$ are $\alpha_{t-1}$ and $v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_l$, and let $[\beta^{(i)}]$ denote the $t$-arc $(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\ldots,\alpha_t,v_i)$ for $1 \leq i \leq l$, so that each $[\beta^{(i)}]$ is a successor of $[\alpha]$. Now $Aut(X)$ is transitive on $t$-arcs if and only if there are automorphisms $g_1,g_2,\ldots,g_l$ in $Aut(X)$ such that $g_i[\alpha] = [\beta^{(i)}] (1 \leq i \leq l)$. The proof of the proposition goes as follows: Proof of Proposition 18.1: Suppose $f$ is an automorphism fixing $\alpha_0,\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_t$; if $f$is not the identity, then $f$ does not fix all $t$-arcs in $X$. Thus, it follows from Lemma 17.4 that there is some $t$-arc $[\beta]$ such that $f$ fixes $[\beta]$, but $f$ does not fix both successors of $[\beta]$. In fact, if $\beta_{t-1},u_1,u_2$ are the vertices adjacent to $\beta_t$, then $f$ must interchange $u_1$ and $u_2$. Let $w \neq \beta_1$ be a vertex adjacent to $\beta_0$. Since $X$ is $t$-transitive there is an automorphism $h \in Aut(X)$ taking the $t$-arc $(w,\beta_0,\ldots,\beta_{t-1})$ to $[\beta]$, and we may suppose the notation chosen so that $h(\beta_t) = u_1$. Then $h$ and $fh$ are automorphisms of $X$ taking the $(t+1)$-arc $[w.\beta]$ to its two successors, and by Theorem 17.5, $Aut(X)$ is transitive on $(t+1)$-arcs. This contradicts our hypothesis, and so we must have $f = 1$. I have some problem understanding parts of the proof. The first thing, which is not really essential for proving the proposition, is the part: In fact, if $\beta_{t-1},u_1,u_2$ are the vertices adjacent to $\beta_t$, then $f$ must interchange $u_1$ and $u_2$ The other problem, which is quite essential to the proof, is the part: Since $X$ is $t$-transitive there is an automorphism $h \in Aut(X)$ taking the $t$-arc $(w,\beta_0,\ldots,\beta_{t-1})$ to $[\beta]$, and we may suppose the notation chosen so that $h(\beta_t) = u_1$. Then $h$ and $fh$ are automorphisms of $X$ taking the $(t+1)$-arc $[w.\beta]$ to its two successors I get why there must be such a $h$, taking $(w,\beta_0,\ldots,\beta_{t-1})$ to $[\beta]$. But I do not get, why we can (without loss of generality) assume that $h(\beta_t)$ is a neighbor of $\beta_t$. Thus, I do not see how the other part; that $h$ and $fh$ are automorphisms of $X$ taking the $(t+1)$-arc $[w.\beta]$ to its two successors is true. This question has become rather long, and I have surely missed a definition of something. Everything in gray, can be found in Biggs 1974, on pages 112-115.

They define the general orthogonal group $GO_{2n}$ over an algebraically closed field $k = \overline{F}_p$ as the group of isometries $$GO_{2n}=\{A \in GL_{2n} \mid f(Ax)=f(x) \text{ for all }x \in k^{2n} \},$$ where $f:k^{2n} \rightarrow k$ is the non-degenerate quadratic form: $f(x_1,...,x_{2n})=x_1x_{2n}+x_2x_{2n-1}+...+x_{n}x_{n+1}.$ Then, they consider the following element $$   g :=\left( \begin{array}{cccc}     I_{n-1}   & & & \\        & 0 &1 &  \\        & 1 &0 & \\        &&&  I_{n-1}    \end{array} \right) \in  GO_{2n},      $$ Moreover, let $F: GO_{2n} \rightarrow GO_{2n}$ , $(a_{ij}) \mapsto (a_{ij}^q)^{-tr} $ , i.e. the composition of the map sending a matrix to the inverse of its transpose with the standard $q$ -Frobenius endomorphism. The general orthogonal group of minus type over the field $F_q$ is defined as the fixed point subgroup of $gF$ : $$GO_{2n}^{-}(q)=(GO_{2n})_{gF}.$$ I'd like to prove that this coincides with the isometry group of a non-denegerate orthogonal form with Witt defect -1, defined on $V=F_q^{2n}$ . In particular in this context I am working with the basis $$\mathcal{B}^{-}=(e_1,f_1,...,e_m,f_m)$$ and the quadratic form $Q$ such that: $$Q(e_i)=Q(f_i)=(e_i,u_m)=(f_i,u_m)=(e_i,v_m)=(f_i,v_m)=0$$ $$(e_i,f_j)=\delta_{ij}, Q(u_m)=Q(v_m)=1, (u_m,v_m)=\zeta^2+\zeta^{-2}$$ where $\zeta \in F_q^2 \setminus F_q$ satisfies $\zeta^{q+1}=1$ . I am pretty stuck in proving that the first  definition is equivalent to the second (I am not interested in this particular $Q$ , I am also looking for the most suitable $Q$ for proving the equivalence, first of all reording the basis $\mathcal{B}^{-}$ should work better). Any hint is greatly appreciated.","I am working with the general orthogonal group of minus type over a finite field with elements.

98,On the Rationalization of Finite Groups,On the Rationalization of Finite Groups,,"Let $\Gamma$ be the countable set of finite groups identifying isomorphic ones (formal details below). Then, the direct product and the subgroup relation gives $(\Gamma,\times,\leq)$ the structure of an ordered monoid where $1\in\Gamma$ is the identity and the bottom element. Also, observe that we have the homomorphism of ordered monoids $O:\Gamma\to\mathbb{N}^+$ that asigns to each group its order. Now, since $(\Gamma,\times)$ is an abelian monoid, we can consider its Grothendieck group $\Gamma^\sharp:=G(\Gamma)$ so that now it makes sense to talk about the reciprocal of a finite group $G^{-1}$ (not to be confused with $\{g^{-1}:g\in G\}=G$ ) satisfying $G\times G^{-1}=1$ . Also, since $\Gamma$ satisfies the cancellation property $A\times C=B\times C\Rightarrow A=B$ , $\Gamma^\sharp$ is non-trivial. My question is the following. Q: Has $\Gamma^\sharp$ been studied before? Is there some interesting interpretation of $G^{-1}$ other than as a mere formality? It would certainly be interesting if objects like $\Sigma_n^{-1}$ could induce some sort of ""action"". Now I'm going to point out some structure that I think comes naturally with $\Gamma^\sharp$ . First, we can extend the partial order $\leq$ to $\Gamma^\sharp$ as $$G_1\times H_1^{-1}\leq G_2\times H_2^{-1}\iff G_1\times H_2\leq G_2\times H_1$$ Also, since we can view $O:\Gamma\to\mathbb{N}^+$ as $O:\Gamma\to\mathbb{Q}^+$ , by the universal property, we can extend it as $O:\Gamma^\sharp\to\mathbb{Q}^+$ giving a group epimorphism $O(G\times H^{-1})=O(G)/O(H)$ that is again monotonous. Moreover, we can endow $\Gamma^\sharp$ with a topology considering the initial topology induced by $O:\Gamma^{\sharp}\to(\mathbb{Q}^+,\tau)$ . That is, $\tau_O=\{O^{-1}(U):U\in\tau\}$ which is the coarsest topology that makes $O$ continuous. This gives $(\Gamma^\sharp,\times,\tau_O)$ the structure of a topological group . Note as well that the map $\Gamma\times\Gamma\to\Gamma^\sharp$ given by $(G,H)\mapsto G\times H^{-1}$ doesn't really extend the classical notion of quotient group since, for example, $C_4\times C_2^{-1}\neq C_4/C_2=C_2$ . Consider the set $X=\{S\leq\Sigma_{\mathbb{N}}:|S|\text{ is finite}\}$ . By Cayley's Theorem , for every finite group $G$ there is some $S_G\in X$ such that $G\cong S_G$ . So we can define $\Gamma:=X/\cong$ . Then, it is easy to check that the following definitions are well-defined for $[S_1],[S_2]\in\Gamma$ We define $[S_1]\times[S_2]=[S_1\times S_2]$ We define $[S_1]\leq[S_2]$ as $\exists S_1'\leq S_2:S_1\cong S_1'$ We define $O([S_1])=|S_1|$","Let be the countable set of finite groups identifying isomorphic ones (formal details below).
