I thought that the example could be solved faster using substitution $\sin{x}=a, \cos{x}=b$ and using the main trigonometric identity: $\sin^2{x}+\cos^2{x}=1$ or $a^2+b^2=1$ .

97,Show that $(i-1)^{8k}$ is a natural number,Show that  is a natural number,(i-1)^{8k},"Let $z = i - 1\in\mathbb{C}$ . Let $n\in\mathbb{N}$ . Show that $z^n \in\mathbb{N}$ when $n$ is divisible by $8$ . I note that $z$ can be written as $$z = \sqrt{2}(\cos(\arctan(-1)) +  i \sin(\arctan(-1))) = \sqrt{2}\left(\cos\left(- \frac{\pi}{4}\right) + i \sin\left(- \frac{\pi}{4}\right)\right)$$ Now, using De Moivre's thereom, which states that $(\cos(\theta) + i \sin(\theta))^{n}=\cos(n\theta) + i \sin(n\theta)$ , $$z^{n} =  \left(\sqrt{2}\left(\cos\left(- \frac{\pi}{4}\right) + i \sin\left(- \frac{\pi}{4}\right)\right)\right)^{n} = \sqrt{2}^{n}\left(\cos\left(-\frac{n\pi}{4}\right) + i \sin\left(- \frac{n\pi}{4}\right)\right)$$ For $n$ increasing by $8$ , $n = 8k$ , where $k$ is natural number. Thus $$z^{n} = \sqrt{2}^{8k}\left(\cos\left(-\frac{8k\pi}{4}\right) + i \sin\left(- \frac{8k\pi}{4}\right)\right).$$ Since $\cos\left(-\frac{8k\pi}{4}\right) = \cos(-2k\pi) = \cos(0) = 1$ and $\sin\left(- \frac{8k\pi}{4}\right)= \sin(-2kπ) = \sin(0) = 0$ , $z^{n} = \sqrt{2}^{8k}$ is indeed a natural number for $n$ increasing by $8$ .
