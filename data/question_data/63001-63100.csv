4,Measuring the Shannon entropy of an ordered sequence,Measuring the Shannon entropy of an ordered sequence,,"I have 927 unique sequences of the numbers 1, 2 and 3, all of which sum to 12 and represent every possible one-octave scale on the piano, with the numbers representing the intervals between notes in half-steps (i.e., adjacent keys). For example, the Major Scale is { 2,2,1,2,2,2,1 }, while the hexatonic (6-note) Blues Scale is { 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2 }. It can help mentally to add a zero at the beginning to represent the root note. I'm trying to decide how to categorize them, and believe Shannon entropy is a natural place to begin, with one problem: The default Shannon Equation returns the same figure agnostic of the order of the sequence (as we would expect), whereas this is a case where the order is supremely relevant. (Music theory and information theory have a lot in common, though this appears to be largely unexplored.) Let's take a simple example: Both of these are valid scales, though neither has a name, to my knowledge: { 1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2 } { 2,2,1,2,1,1,1,2 } Since there are equal numbers of 1s and 2s in each set, we don't need a calculator to see that the Shannon Entropy for each is 4: $$-\sum_{i=1}^8 \frac{1}{2} \log_{2}\frac{1}{2}$$ However, I believe--I may be very wrong here--that there is significantly more information contained in the second sequence, given that the first can be communicated as ""{1,2}, four times"" while the second is considerably more arbitrary. (I believe this is debate in bioinformatics, where one can locate long spans of simple repeating sequences of nucleotides that some consider ""junk DNA,"" though others dispute that adjective.) How does one account for order when measuring surprisal? If I were to take, say, The Great Gatsby and sort the ~261,000 characters (as in letters, etc., not fictional people!) in ASCII order, I don't think it would contain the same amount of information as the original text. One strategy I tried was a rolling measure of probability, where the algorithm is initially unaware of the total frequency of each number but accumulates the odds as it goes. (I suppose this is like measuring the accumulating surprisal of a die you cannot see and don't know how many sides it has.) This did not produce very intuitive or useful results. Another thought I had was to divide each sequence into ""words"" that are repeating sub-sequences of at least two digits, then measure the entropy of each word and ... I'm not sure what to do with them. A sum of $H[{1,2}]$ four times still adds to 4. I'm a bit out of my depth here both in reducing sequences to the most efficient subsequences and knowing what to do with them. I've read Shannon's 1948 paper twice, including the discussion of the relative odds of letters in a given language, which seems relevant but is, in fact, not useful in this case, where every possible ordered combination is present and the intervals are added independently of those preceding them, with the edge case that they cannot exceed a sum of 12. Which is all to say, how does one quantify the entropy of an ordered sequence, when the order is of extreme relevance but each item is independent of the others? Below I'll include how I generated the 927 sequences for anyone interested, but it's ancillary to the question, I think. *** First, I wrote a simple recursive algorithm that begins with an empty set and calls itself three times after adding 1, 2 or 3, terminating when the sum is 12 and tossing any that go over. Happy to provide code or pseudo-code, but I think it's intuitive. To check myself, I generated the all the combinations of [1,2,3] that add to 12--there are 19--using a Coin-Change algorithm , and then calculated the unique, distinct permutations of each of them (treating identical digits as indistinguishable). The sum of the permutations is also 927, which range from 1 for the sequence of twelve 1s (the Chromatic Scale) or four 3s (a sparse diminished scale) to 140 possible scales for the intervals { 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3 }, which almost subsumes the Harmonic Minor Scale. One more thought Regarding the above example of four 1s and four 2s: If I was flipping an unbiased coin 12 times and coding Heads as ""1"" and Tails as ""2"", I would be more surprised, in a general sense of the word, to get alternating results than to get the second sequence with small clusters. So it's possible that ""surprisal"" is the wrong frame of mind here versus information.","I have 927 unique sequences of the numbers 1, 2 and 3, all of which sum to 12 and represent every possible one-octave scale on the piano, with the numbers representing the intervals between notes in half-steps (i.e., adjacent keys).

I'm struggling to understand why my solution is wrong, and why the given solution is correct. My proof is, given N people, if we leave 1 seat to the left of each person blank, then no one has to sit next to each other, however the next person who sits has to sit next to someone. We then proceed to find the number of people this arrangement will need. Since the number of occupied and unoccupied seats must add up to 60, 2N=60. Therefore, N = 30 people can be seated. However, the solution given is 20. The explanation is ""If every third seat is occupied, filling 20 seats, then every unoccupied seat has a person sitting next to it, so N could be 20. To see that N must be at least 20, note that any seating which satisfies the conditions cannot contain a gap of more than 2 unoccupied seats between any occupied seats. If we regard adjacent occupied seats as having a gap of 0 between them, every seating of N people contains N gaps, all of which must be less than 2. Thus N+2N = 3N is at least as big as the sum of N and all the which is 60, therefore 3N ≥ 60 and N ≥ 20.Note that there are simpler arguments that work when there are 60 seats around the table, but this proof has the advantage of working just as well when the number of seats is not a multiple of 3 (e.g. for 59 seats N must still be at least 20 since 3N ≥ 59, and for 61 seats 3N ≥ 61 implies N ≥ 21).""

Thus N+2N = 3N is at least as big as the sum of N and all the which is 60, therefore 3N ≥ 60 and N ≥ 20.Note that there are simpler arguments that work when there are 60 seats around the table, but this proof has the advantage of working just as well when the number of seats is not a multiple of 3 (e.g. for 59 seats N must still be at least 20 since 3N ≥ 59, and for 61 seats 3N ≥ 61 implies N ≥ 21)."" I don't understand why my reasoning is false, and why their reasoning is correct. Could someone explain this to me? Thanks in advance.",,"['combinatorics', 'proof-explanation']"
7,Max packing of cars in square parking lot,Max packing of cars in square parking lot,,"An $n\times n$ square grid represents a parking lot, each of the $n^2$ squares may be occupied by at most one car.

Two people, X and Y, cannot be seated next to each other. How many seating arrangements are possible?"" My Method: First, I imagined the combinations of just seating 8 people at the table, by placing a person in a chair. This leaves 7! total possible combinations of seating arrangements. However, this is too many combinations - it includes the combinations where X and Y are sitting together. To correct this, I determined how many invalid options we created by seating X and Y together. By treating X and Y as a single entity, XY, taking up 2 seats, I treated the new problem as picking 7 seats with 7 people. As before, I placed a person in a seat, giving a total of 6! unique combinations too many. However, this overshoot (6!) is still not correct, as it only takes into account the combination XY (YX would have also been counted in the original number of total combinations). Since there are 2 ways that X and Y can be combined, the actual overshoot is 2$*$6!. With this, we can say that 7! gives the total possible combinations, while 2$*$6! gives the overshoot, meaning that there are 7!-(2$*$6!) combinations (3600 combinations).

However, this overshoot (6!) is still not correct, as it only takes into account the combination XY (YX would have also been counted in the original number of total combinations). Since there are 2 ways that X and Y can be combined, the actual overshoot is 2$*$6!. With this, we can say that 7! gives the total possible combinations, while 2$*$6! gives the overshoot, meaning that there are 7!-(2$*$6!) combinations (3600 combinations). Does this method work and produce the correct answer? If it does produce the correct answer, is there a better (or more ideal) way to view this problem? If it does not work, where did I go wrong? I am working my way through ""Introduction to Combinatorics and Graph Theory"", by David Guichard (which is where this problem comes from) on my own, and I don't have any real way to determine how well I am grasping the material yet (I haven't found a solutions manual to verify even the numbers are correct, let alone the method to reach the solution)",,"['combinatorics', 'proof-verification']"

A Rubik's cube has 6 colors, one for each side, but I started thinking about ways to $n$-color the cube and other $2n$-polyhedra. While researching it I came across group theory, which led me to learn about Burnside's lemma (this is a really deep rabbit hole!). As I understand it, the way that it works is that you first find the cycle index for the group you want to consider, which in our case lets us count all the ways you can permute the faces of the polyhedron. Then it's a straightforward substitution with $n$ = the number of colors to consider. For instance, the cycle index of the cube tells us that if we have n colors, then there are $\frac{1}{3}n^2 + \frac{1}{2}n^3 + \frac{1}{8}n^4 + \frac{1}{24}n^6$ ways to color the cube.

However, what I'd like to know is how to tell how many ways there are to color a $2n$-polyhedron using $n$ colors, where each color is used exactly twice . Any hints? Where I'm at right now is that it seems like the cycle index would still figure prominently, but now some of the enumerations aren't considered -- basically, every time there is a coloring that uses a color in a frequency other than twice, we want to throw it away.

Now I'd like to know, for a random ternary number, in this form, of $m$ digits, what is the probability that the first (least significant) $n$ bits are all zero?

If I take $n=2$, I'd be finding the probability that the 2 least significant bits are all zero.  Of the numbers in binary, 0,100, and 1100 have the 2 least significant bits as zero.

So, there could be an issue of defining concepts or words not being strict or even be ambiguous about what I'm actually saying. Please, take that into consideration while reading this. Now, let's get started. Let's say, there's a sentence with $3$ words, $a$ , $b$ , and $c$ . We can analyze this sentence by structuring ""syntactic trees"" in $3$ ways. Then, I deleted all the middle nodes between a root and $a,b$ , and $c$ . Here's a picture of this process. Of course, there can be a tree which looks like this. But I would like to say that the 3rd tree in the first picture and this tree in the 2nd picture are same, because I can say that both node $a'$ and node $a''$ are referring to exactly same thing which is the node $a$ . Every time I do the analysis, I will delete all the nodes from the tree except the root and last nodes without any child. When I apply this rule to analyze $4$ 'word' sentence, I will get these trees. Here's the question. How many different ""syntactic trees"" are there of an $m$ word sentence? Thinking of this, I first thought of the number of partitions of $m$ : the number of ways to write $m$ as a sum of positive integers. (For $4$ , there's $5$ ways to do this: $1+1+1+1$ , $2+1+1$ , $2+2$ , $3+1$ , $4$ ) In 'syntactic trees' however, we do care about order. Investigating the topic with my friend, I finally able to show all the possible ways to write $m$ as a sum of positive integers, where order matters. First, get all the possible ways about small number; for example $3$ . Then, for all the possibilities, do $2$ kinds of operations in each possibility. One is about summing $1$ to the leftmost term of a equation, for example, $1+1+1 \rightarrow (1+1)+1+1 \rightarrow 2+1+1$ . Second is about making a new $1$ next to the leftmost term of a equation, for example, $1+1+1 \rightarrow (1)+1+1+1 \rightarrow 1+1+1+1$ . By doing these operations to every equation, I could get all the possibilities of making $4$ without any duplications. Obviously, all the possibilities related to $m$ can be represented as $2^{m-1}$ . But problem was, I needed to take care of all the possibilities within every term of each equation. For bigger numbers, this will definitely become insane. I couldn't think of good way to make a formula for counting trees related to $m$ words. Even figuring out how to do the operation faster or coming up with more clever methods was too much for me. I had no choice but to use a brute force method. Using Python, I was able to count number of trees of an $m$ word sentence, and until $m=20$ it was not a big deal. However, the time it took to calculate further terms seemed to increase exponentially, making this approach infeasible for higher values. One thing I noticed was that between every step, the ratio between the number of $m$ word trees, and the number of $m+1$ word trees seemed to converge to some constant. I don't understand why this happens. Here I've plotted the successive ratio of each step in graph.

Indeed, if k is odd and $k=2y+1$ for some $0\leq y\leq p/2 - 1$ , we can take the sum $p+(p-1)+1 + \cdots (p-y) + y$ as $p-i, i < p, p-i\neq i$ for $i < p$ , $p-y > y$ since $y < p/2,$ and $y$ is the highest second element among the pairs $(p-1,1),(p-2,2),\cdots, (p-y,y)$ while the first terms are strictly decreasing. If $k=2y$ is even, then we have the sum $(p-1 + 1) + \cdots + (p-y+y),$ which is a sum of distinct elements by similar reasoning to above as $y \leq (p-1)/2.$ Now given such a subset, say $B := \{a_1,\cdots, a_k\},$ define for $0\leq i\leq p-1$ the subset $B_i$ by $$B_i := \{f(a_1+i), \cdots, f(a_k+i)\}$$ where $f(x)$ is the unique element $y$ of $\{1,\cdots, p\}$ so that $x\equiv y\mod p.$ Then note that all the elements $a_j + i$ are distinct modulo $p$ and since $f(a_j+i)\equiv a_j+i\bmod p$ for all $a_j+i$ , the terms $f(b)$ are distinct where $b$ ranges over $B.$ Also, $\sum_{a\in B_i} a \equiv a_1+\cdots + a_k + ik \equiv ik\mod p.$ Each residue $ik\mod p$ is distinct because if $ik \equiv jk$ for some $0\leq i < j < p,$ then $p$ would divide $(i-j)k$ and hence $p$ would divide $(i-j)$ . Since $p$ is coprime to $k$ , this implies $i-j$ is divisible by $p$ , which is a contradiction since $0<|i-j|<p.$ Hence each $B_i$ is distinct. Now note that each $k$ -subset of $\{1,\cdots, p\}$ belongs to exactly one $B_i, 0\leq i\leq p-1$ for some $B$ . Indeed, let for each $B,$ the set of $B_i$ 's defined above be the cycle of B. Note that if two cycles intersected, then they would be the same cycle. Note that here it's crucial that $p$ is prime (the claims above could still work if $p$ was replaced by $\dfrac{p}{\gcd(p,k)}$ ). Suppose the cycles of $B=\{b_1,\cdots, b_k\}$ and $A=\{a_1,\cdots, a_k\}$ intersected. Then there exist $s,t$ so that $A_t = B_s$ . So $a_i + t \equiv b_{\sigma(i)} + s$ for some permutation $\sigma$ of $\{1,\cdots, k\}.$ Then $a_i\equiv b_{\sigma(i)} + s-t$ for all i. But then A equals $B_{s-t}$ ( $B_{s-t}$ may not be defined if we replaced $p$ with $\dfrac{p}{\gcd(p,k)}$ in our construction of the $B_i$ 's). Hence for all $0\leq i\leq p-1, A_i$ equals $B_{s-t + i\mod p}$ and since the cycle elements $B_i$ are distinct for all i, this shows that the map $A_i\mapsto B_{(s-t+i)\mod p}$ defines a bijection between the cycle of A and the cycle of B. Hence distinct cycles are disjoint. But in each cycle, each of the $B_i$ 's has a distinct sum modulo p as proved above, so exactly one $B_i$ has sum $0$ mod p. Thus, the required answer is $\dfrac{{p\choose k}}{p}.$ I'm not sure if generating functions could be useful when p is not prime. Let $\xi$ be a primitive p-th root of unity (note that these are precisely the numbers of the form $e^{2\pi i k/p}$ where k is coprime to p). Consider the product $\prod_{j=1}^p (1+\xi^j).$ Note that when this product is written in the form $b_1 \xi + b_2\xi^2+\cdots + b_p \xi^p$ (which is possible since $\xi^p=1\Rightarrow \xi^{p+k} = \xi^k$ for all k), $b_p$ equals the number of subsets of $x$ with sum divisible by p.","Let be an integer exceeding 1 and suppose Find the number of -element subsets of so that I've only managed to solve the above problem when p is prime. If then the number of 1-element subsets of with sum congruent to 0 mod 2 is Henceforth assume . Then note that for every , we can find a k element subset whose sum is congruent to 0 mod p. Indeed, if k is odd and for some , we can take the sum as for , since and is the highest second element among the pairs while the first terms are strictly decreasing. If is even, then we have the sum which is a sum of distinct elements by similar reasoning to above as Now given such a subset, say define for the subset by where is the unique element of so that Then note that all the elements are distinct modulo and since for all , the terms are distinct where ranges over Also, Each residue is distinct because if for some then would divide and hence would divide .

For the case $m < 2n$, we have $0$ way to do this, obviously.

The standard presentation in terms of the partitions of n is presented earlier and makes sense to me, but this isn't as clear.","It is claimed in a text I am reading that the cycle index of the symmetric group satisfies the recurrence relation $$Z(S_n)=n^{-1} \sum_{k=1}^n{s_kZ(S_{n-k})}$$ This is presented without explanation, much less proof.
