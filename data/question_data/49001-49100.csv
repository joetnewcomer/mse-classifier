96,slightly tricky integral,slightly tricky integral,,"was asked to evaluate  $\displaystyle\int_0^\infty \dfrac{\log(x)}{1+x^2} dx = I$ firstly, I got the solution using the substitution $ t = \dfrac{1}{x} $ and then getting $\displaystyle\int_0^\infty \dfrac{\log(x)}{1+x^2} dx = -\displaystyle\int_0^\infty \dfrac{\log(x)}{1+x^2} dx $ so $I = -I \implies I = 0$ however this substitution was a lucky guess more than anything, so how would I go about it using this way? let $x = \tan(\theta)$ then this transforms $I $ to $$ \displaystyle \int_0^\frac{\pi}{2} \log(\tan(\theta))\,d\theta = \int_0^\frac{\pi}{2} \log(\sin(\theta))\,d\theta - \int_0^\frac{\pi}{2} \log(\cos(\theta))\,d\theta = $$ $$=\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2} \log(\sin(\theta))\,d\theta - \int_0^\frac{\pi}{2} \log(\sin(\dfrac{\pi}{2} -\theta))\,d\theta$$  how would I go from there?","was asked to evaluate  $\displaystyle\int_0^\infty \dfrac{\log(x)}{1+x^2} dx = I$ firstly, I got the solution using the substitution $ t = \dfrac{1}{x} $ and then getting $\displaystyle\int_0^\infty \dfrac{\log(x)}{1+x^2} dx = -\displaystyle\int_0^\infty \dfrac{\log(x)}{1+x^2} dx $ so $I = -I \implies I = 0$ however this substitution was a lucky guess more than anything, so how would I go about it using this way? let $x = \tan(\theta)$ then this transforms $I $ to $$ \displaystyle \int_0^\frac{\pi}{2} \log(\tan(\theta))\,d\theta = \int_0^\frac{\pi}{2} \log(\sin(\theta))\,d\theta - \int_0^\frac{\pi}{2} \log(\cos(\theta))\,d\theta = $$ $$=\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2} \log(\sin(\theta))\,d\theta - \int_0^\frac{\pi}{2} \log(\sin(\dfrac{\pi}{2} -\theta))\,d\theta$$  how would I go from there?",,['integration']

We have a simplified version with Stochastic Integral Equation: $X_t=-a\int^t_0 X_s\,ds +B_t$. B is the Brownian motion. And its analytic solution is $X_t=e^{-at}\int^t_0 e^{as}\,dB_s$. How do I prove that this is the case? I know that $e^{-at}=-a\int^t_0 e^{-as}\,ds$ and that I'm somehow supposed to make use of this result but I am still unable to get from the analytic solution to the integral equation.
