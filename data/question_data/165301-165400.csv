0,Can someone clarify something in Fubini's theorem please?,Can someone clarify something in Fubini's theorem please?,,"In my notes I have a version of Fubini's theorem which differs from the other forms of it I've seen which seem to all be like the one found on wiki here . Here is the version I have in my notes; Let $(X,\mathcal{A},\mu),\;(Y,\mathcal{B},\nu)$ be complete $\sigma$-finite measure spaces and $f$ a function on $X \times Y$ whose integral with respect to $\mu \widehat{\otimes} \nu$ exists (completion of the product measure $\mu \otimes \nu$).

Can someone explain why switching to the completion of the product measure removes the requirement for our function to be integrable? Note integral exists means it is well defined but possibly infinite. Integrable means the integral is finite. As you can see on the wiki page (counterexamples at the bottom) under their conditions if the integral is infinite the theorem does not hold. But here we seem to have removed that issue.

5,Proof of the spectral theorem,Proof of the spectral theorem,,"I am currently going to through my proof of the spectral theorem that we had in class, but I feel that I have copied some nonsense from the board. So we defined the Cayley transform $U= (T-i)(T+i)^{-1} = (T+i-2i)(T+i)^{-1}=id-2i(T+i)^{-1}$ and therefore $(T+i)^{-1}= \frac{1}{2i}(id-U)$. Then we showed earlier that any unitary operator can be written as $e^{iA}$ for some self-adjoint bounded $A$ such that $\sigma(A) \subset [-\pi,\pi]$. Now $-U$ is definitely unitary, as the Cayley transform is unitary, so we have $$\langle -U_t x,x \rangle =  \int e^{it}d\mu_x,$$ where $\mu_x$ is the Borel measure from the functional calculus of $A$. Thus by using  $(T+i)^{-1}= \frac{1}{2i}(id-U)$ we can write $$\langle (T+i)^{-1}x,x\rangle  = \frac{1}{2i} \int(1+e^{it}) d\mu_x$$ and now comes the problem, somehow at the end we made a $arctan$ substitution and I wrote $$\langle (T+i)^{-1}x,x\rangle  = \frac{1}{2i} \int_{\mathbb{R}} (1+e^{i \arctan(s)}) ds$$ and then we rewrote the integrand by Euler's identity so that we ende up with (this I undestand again) $$\langle (T+i)^{-1}x,x\rangle  = \frac{1}{2i} \int_{\mathbb{R}} \frac{1}{s+i} ds$$ The problem is that I don't get this substitution, is there anybody who could make this substitution of the arctan function rigorous, i.e. I don't get what this $ds$ now means, what kind of measure is this?

7,Outer measured induced by a point measure over an algebra of sets,Outer measured induced by a point measure over an algebra of sets,,"I'm helping a friend with problem 7 from section 3.3 of Vestrup's 'Theory of Measures and Integrals'. We got partway into the problem, but after a few hours of chatting about it we were still stumped. I think it's a fun problem (though not exactly research-grade), so I'm posting it here! First we fix a set $\Omega$, a point $\omega \in \Omega$, and an algebra of sets $A \subset 2^\Omega$ such that $\{\omega\}$ is an atom of $\sigma(A)$. Then define $\mu(M) = 1_M(\omega)$ for $M \in A$. We define the outer-measure associated with $\mu$ by letting $\mu^*(M) = \inf \{\sum{ \mu(F_i)}\ |\ F_i \in A,\ M \subset \cup F_i \} $, where $F_i$ are at most countable $A$-covers of M. The question is what is $\mu^*$? What are the measurable sets of $\mu^*$? Some work so far: If $\omega \in M$, then $\mu^*(M) = 1$. To see this, note that any $A$-cover of $M$ must cover $\omega$ at least once, and hence $\mu^*(M) \geq 1$. However $\mu(\Omega) = 1$ bounds things sharply from above. On the other hand, if $M$ is nonempty and $\omega \notin M$, it seems reasonable that $\mu^*(M) = 0$. However, we had a hard time ruling  out the possibility where $M$ does not admit any $\omega$-free $A$-covers. We think the condition on the generated $\sigma$-algebra of $A$ is key to understanding what happens, but don't know how to apply it. If we relax the condition that $\{\omega\} \in \Sigma(A)$, we can get a very trivial outer measure. Let $A = \{\Omega, \emptyset\}$, and fix an arbitrary $\omega$. Then $\mu^*(M) = 1$ for any non-empty $M$, and is zero otherwise. In this case $\sigma(A) = A$ and $\{\omega\}$ is nowhere to be found. On the other hand, let $\Omega = [0,1]$, fix $\omega = 0$, and let $A$ by the algebra generated by the family of sets $F_i = [1, 1/i]$. In this case, $\{0\}$ is not an atom of $A$, however it does belong to $\sigma(A)$. But now, we get things like $\mu^*((0,1]) = 1$ and in general, $\inf{M} = 0$ entails $\mu^*(M) = 1$, since all $A$-covers of $M$ must include $0$. So, barring any mistakes, it seems like it may not be so easy to characterize $\mu^*$ ! [Edit:] It looks like I did make a mistake. Namely, in the example I gave, $A$ has the sets $G_i = (1/i, 1]$, being the complements of the $F_i$. But $G_i$ eventually covers any individual point in $(0,1]$, without ever including $0$ so it turns out $\mu*((0,1]) = 0$, as expected. I do not yet know how to show if  $0 \in \sigma(A)$ is necessary or sufficient for this.

Finitely additive and $\sigma$-additive measures are defined in a natural way on finite algebras and $\sigma$-algebras, respectively. I know that every $\sigma$-additive function is additive, and that every $\sigma$-algebra is an algebra. Hence, we can safely define a $\sigma$-additive measure on a finite algebra. More, the finite measure and the $\sigma$-additive measure coincide. I can see two ways of doing it: 1) Add infinitely many empty sets to satisfy the requirement of denumerability. For example, $$\mu(E\cup F)=\mu(E\cup F\cup\emptyset\cup\emptyset\cup\ ...)=\mu E+\mu F+\mu 0+\mu 0+\ ...=\mu E+\mu F$$ 2) Simply restrict the the $\sigma$-additive measure $\mu$ to the finite algebra $\mathcal{A}$.

I was given permission to research/ask about this specific line of reasoning, in large because I think the professor thinks it might work and this is not a ``standard'' solution to this problem. The question on the exam is: Given  a measurable space $(X,B)$, and $\mu_n$ a sequence of measures on $(X,B)$ with $\mu_n(A) \rightarrow \mu(A)$ for each $A \in B$. If $\mu(X) < \infty$, then $\mu$ is a measure. A little notation: Let $\{a^{(n)}\}$ be a collection of sequences, where the $i$th term in the $j$th sequence is given by $a^{(j)}_i$. The above theorem can be deduced readily from the following lemma: Let $\{a^{(n)}\}$ be a collection of sequences of non-negative real numbers. Suppose $\exists M >0$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^\infty a^{(n)}_i < M$ for each $n$. Suppose further that $a^{(n)}_i \rightarrow a_i$, some real number as $n \rightarrow \infty$. Then $$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{i=1}^\infty a^{(n)}_i =\sum_{i=1}^\infty a_i$$ Now, my attempt at proving the lemma was to turn this into a problem in measure theory. Given $\{a^{(n)}\}$ as in the lemma, define $$\phi_n(x) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty a^{(n)}_i \chi_{(i,i+1]}$$. Where $\chi_A$ is the usuall characteristic function for a set $A$.  Intuitively, $\phi_n(x)$ looks like an infinite step function, where $\phi_n(x) = a^{(n)}_i$ if $x \in (i,i+1]$. Now, it is clear that $\int \phi_n(x) dx = \sum_{i=1}^\infty a^{(n)}_i$. Moreover, we have that $\phi_n(x) \rightarrow \phi(x) := \sum_{i=1}^\infty a_i \chi_{(i,i+1]}$. All that remains is to show: $$\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \int \phi_n(x) = \int \phi(x)$$ This will require some kind of convergence theorem. There doesn't seem to be one readily available, but these functions have lots of special properties. Such a convergence theorem would start with ``Let $\{f_n\}$ be a sequence of non-negative Lebesgue integrable functions. '' Here are some hypotheses one could take: $f_n \rightarrow f$ pointwise. $\int f_n  < M$ for some universal bound $M$. As a sequence in $n$, $\int f_n$ converges and is finite. $\|f_n\|_\infty < M$ for some universal constant $M$. Unfortunately, I don't believe these hypotheses quite do it. Say $\phi_n = \chi_{(n,n+1]}$. These guys converge pointwise to $0$ but in integral to $1$. My question is: Is there a set of additional hypotheses one can take to deduce a convergence theorem that resolves the lemma? EDIT: Okay, it has been pointed out that the lemma isn't true (with a clear counterexample). The question now becomes can one take the theorem, and build the correct lemma that allows you to employ this kind of technique? I've basically managed to do nothing but persuade myself that $\mu(X)< \infty$ must tell you more than  one can assume there is some $M$ such that for any countable collection of disjoint sets in $B$ $\sum \mu_n(A_i) < M$","First, I want to mention that this problem is off of a take home final I have.
