Find all real polynomials $p(x)$ of degree $n \geq 2$ for which there exists real numbers $ r_1 < r_2 < ... < r_n$ such that $p(r_i) = 0$,  $i = 1,2,...,n,$ and $p'(\frac{r_i + r_{i+1}}{2}) = 0$,  $i = 1,2,...,n-1$, where $p'(x)$ denotes the derivative of $p(x)$ (messy) attempt involving checking coefficients; Any polynomial of degree $n$ with roots in $r_1, r_2, ...,r_n$ will have the following form: $p(x) = c(x-r_1)(x-r_2)...(x-r_n)$ Expanding this we must get that the coefficient of $x^{n-1}$ is: $-c(r_1 + r_2 + ... + r_n)$. This would imply that the coefficient of $x^{n-2}$ of the (monic equivalent) derivative $p'(x)$ is: $\frac{(1-n)}{n}(r_1 + r_2 + ... + r_n)$ (1) So the derivative function must have same coefficient in front of $x^{n-2}$, and from description we get that it is supposed to have following form: $p'(x) = (x-\frac{r_1 + r_2}{2}) (x-\frac{r_2 + r_3}{2})... (x-\frac{r_n-1 + r_n}{2})$ Expanding this will yield $x^{n-2}$ term with following coefficient: $-(\frac{r_1}{2} + r_2 + r_3 + ... + r_{n-1} + \frac{r_n}{2})$ (2) By inspecting equations (1) and (2) we see that they are equal in case of $n = 2$ and never else. So the answer would be the set of polynomials of degree 2? (btw, how do I make the numeration of equation look nice? :))","I've been lately having fun with some Putnam problems (http://www.math.harvard.edu/putnam/) and I would like to see how todays problem can be solved and for somebody more experienced to check my attempted solution. Find all real polynomials $p(x)$ of degree $n \geq 2$ for which there exists real numbers $ r_1 < r_2 < ... < r_n$ such that $p(r_i) = 0$,  $i = 1,2,...,n,$ and $p'(\frac{r_i + r_{i+1}}{2}) = 0$,  $i = 1,2,...,n-1$, where $p'(x)$ denotes the derivative of $p(x)$ (messy) attempt involving checking coefficients; Any polynomial of degree $n$ with roots in $r_1, r_2, ...,r_n$ will have the following form: $p(x) = c(x-r_1)(x-r_2)...(x-r_n)$ Expanding this we must get that the coefficient of $x^{n-1}$ is: $-c(r_1 + r_2 + ... + r_n)$. This would imply that the coefficient of $x^{n-2}$ of the (monic equivalent) derivative $p'(x)$ is: $\frac{(1-n)}{n}(r_1 + r_2 + ... + r_n)$ (1) So the derivative function must have same coefficient in front of $x^{n-2}$, and from description we get that it is supposed to have following form: $p'(x) = (x-\frac{r_1 + r_2}{2}) (x-\frac{r_2 + r_3}{2})... (x-\frac{r_n-1 + r_n}{2})$ Expanding this will yield $x^{n-2}$ term with following coefficient: $-(\frac{r_1}{2} + r_2 + r_3 + ... + r_{n-1} + \frac{r_n}{2})$ (2) By inspecting equations (1) and (2) we see that they are equal in case of $n = 2$ and never else. So the answer would be the set of polynomials of degree 2? (btw, how do I make the numeration of equation look nice? :))",,"['calculus', 'contest-math']"

Full disclosure: this question appeared on an open book exam for my analysis class. The exam is now over – I can no longer submit answers – so this question is purely for my interest. Also please note that this function $f$ is not necessarily continuous everywhere on $[a, b]$ , so it does not satisfy all the conditions of the fundamental theorem of calculus. Please find my work on the problem below: Obviously if $f$ is everywhere continuous on $[a, b]$ then the statement holds, so we can suppose $f$ is not continuous everywhere on $[a, b]$ . I know that a function is Riemann integrable on $[a, b]$ if and only if it is continuous almost everywhere on $[a, b]$ . That is, the set of points where it is not continuous is a set of measure zero. So the set $U$ of points where $f$ is not continuous is a set of measure zero.  Also I have the following result from class, which is stronger than the fundamental theorem of calculus. Lemma. Let $f$ be integrable on $[a, b]$ and let $c ∈ [a, b]$ . Suppose $f$ is continuous at $x_0 ∈ [a, b]$ . Let $F(x) = \int_c^x f(t) \, dt$ . Then $$F'(x_0) = f(x_0).$$ So the statement given in the title certainly holds at every point where $f$ is continuous. That is, $F'(x_0) = f(x_0)$ at every point in $x_0 \in U$ . Now, the question that remains as far as I can see, since the statement we are considering includes the assumption that $F$ is differentiable at $x_0$ , is whether $F$ can be differentiable at $x_0$ while $f$ is not continuous at $x_0$ . So we really just need to consider the case where $f$ is not continuous at $x_0$ . This is where I am stuck. I tried to proceed by classifying the possible discontinuities at $x_0$ . The fact that $f$ is integrable means $f$ is bounded, so it definitely does not have an essential discontinuity at $x_0$ . But a priori it may have a jump discontinuity or a removable discontinuity at $x_0$ . I think that if $f$ has a jump discontinuity at $x_0$ then $F$ will not be differentiable at $x_0$ , although I can’t prove it. As for a removable discontinuity, I think the effect of this would be that $F'(x_0) \neq f(x_0)$ , although I also cannot prove it. I also tried the following to prove the statement to be true: The fact that the set $U$ of points where $f$ is discontinuous is of measure zero also means that $U$ is dense in $[a, b]$ . So every subinterval of $[a, b]$ contains points in $U$ . This means we can choose a sequence $x_n \to x_0$ with $x_n \neq x_0$ and $x_n ∈ U$ for all $n$ . So then since $x_n ∈ U$ it follows by the lemma that $F'(x_n) = f(x_n)$ for all $n$ . Thus, $$\lim_{n \to \infty} F'(x_n) = \lim_{n \to \infty} f(x_n).$$ But this gets us nowhere since we don't know if $f$ or $F'$ is continuous at $x_0$ That's all the information I have on the problem.

I'd be grateful if you could help me to prove it. Edit : I am really sorry for the additional questions. I want to know why must be a bounded non-negative function? Could you give an example problem to apply the lemma? Please elaborate your answer. Thank you.","f(x) \begin{equation}\int_0^\infty f\left(x+\frac{1}{x}\right)\,\frac{\ln x}{x}\,dx=0\end{equation} f(x)","['calculus', 'real-analysis', 'integration', 'definite-integrals', 'improper-integrals']"

98,Duo Fresnel-like integrals $(??)$,Duo Fresnel-like integrals,(??),"I really wonder how I can prove the following integrals. $$\int_0^\infty \sin ax^2\cos 2bx\, dx=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2a}}\left(\cos \frac{b^2}{a}-\sin\frac{b^2}{a}\right)$$ and $$\int_0^\infty \cos ax^2\cos 2bx\, dx=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2a}}\left(\cos \frac{b^2}{a}+\sin\frac{b^2}{a}\right)$$ I tried $\sin ax^2=\Im(e^{iax^2})$ and $\cos ax^2=\Re(e^{iax^2})$ then I used by parts method but I failed. Obviously tangent half-angle substitution doesn't work. I'm quite sure if we can calculate one of them, the similar technique can be used to calculate the other. Could anyone here please help me to calculate the integrals preferably ( if possible ) with elementary ways (high school methods)? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.","I really wonder how I can prove the following integrals. $$\int_0^\infty \sin ax^2\cos 2bx\, dx=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2a}}\left(\cos \frac{b^2}{a}-\sin\frac{b^2}{a}\right)$$ and $$\int_0^\infty \cos ax^2\cos 2bx\, dx=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2a}}\left(\cos \frac{b^2}{a}+\sin\frac{b^2}{a}\right)$$ I tried $\sin ax^2=\Im(e^{iax^2})$ and $\cos ax^2=\Re(e^{iax^2})$ then I used by parts method but I failed.

99,$\epsilon - \delta$ definition of continuity?,definition of continuity?,\epsilon - \delta,"trying to recall the $\epsilon, \delta$ definition of continuity, I came up with the following: A function is continuous at $x$ if $\forall \epsilon > 0 \; \exists \; \delta > 0: |f(x-\delta) - f(x+\delta)| < \epsilon$. This is very likely not equivalent to the Weierstrass' definition of continuity at $c$: $\forall \epsilon > 0 \; \exists \; \delta > 0: |x-c| < \delta \Rightarrow |f(x) - f(c)| < \epsilon $. Could you please point out where the first statement fails to be equivalent to Weierstrass'? Many thanks!","trying to recall the $\epsilon, \delta$ definition of continuity, I came up with the following: A function is continuous at $x$ if $\forall \epsilon > 0 \; \exists \; \delta > 0: |f(x-\delta) - f(x+\delta)| < \epsilon$.
