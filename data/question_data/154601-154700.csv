Specifically, I'm talking about numbers of the form $a^b$ where $a > 10,000$ and $b > 10,000$, and in general $a$ and $b$ are small, but $a^b$ has millions of digits.

14,Conjecture: All but 21 non-square integers are the sum of a square and a prime,Conjecture: All but 21 non-square integers are the sum of a square and a prime,,"Update on 6/19/2020. This discussion led to deeper and deeper results on the topic. The last findings are described in my new post (including my two answers), here . I came up with the following conjecture. All non-square integers $z$ can be represented as $z=x^2 + y$ where $x$ is an integer and $y$ is a prime. The exceptions are z = 10, 34, 58, 85, 91, 130, 214, 226, 370, 526, 706, 730, 771, 1255, 1351, 1414, 1906, 2986, 3676, 9634, 21679. Note that this is deeper than Goldbach conjecture (all even numbers are the sum of two primes) because squares are far rarer than primes. Also, few numbers are the sum of two squares, such numbers (sums of two squares) are far more abundant than primes, but their natural density is also zero. But all numbers are the sum of four squares. Surprisingly, all integers can be represented as $z = \lfloor x^c \rfloor + \lfloor y^c \rfloor$ where $x, y$ are positive integers and $c < \log_{22} 63$ is a positive constant; but this fails at $c = \log_{22} 63$ as $z=73$ becomes an exception. See section 1 in this article for details; this is also a conjecture. Question : Can you verify if my conjecture is true up to some very large $z$ ? I tested it only for $0\leq z < 750000$ . Heuristics behind this conjecture This is by no mean a proof, but rather, I explain here why I think it could be true. Let denote as $r(z)$ the number of solutions to $x^2 +y \leq z$ where $x, y$ are integers and $y$ is prime. For a fixed large $z$ , we want to count the number of integer couples $(x, w)$ below the curve $z=x^2+ w\log w$ , with $x, w\geq 0$ , in order to approximate $r(z)$ . The choice of $w \log w$ is a direct consequence of the prime number theorem, replacing primes by their approximation, for large primes.  That count $r(z)$ grows faster than $O(z)$ . The derivative $dr(z)/dz$ thus grows faster than $O(1)$ , and it shows how the number of solutions to $z=x^2+y$ grows on average, faster than $O(1)$ as $z$ increases. More details about the heuristic approach Essentially, we are trying to count the number of blue points under the red curve in the plot below (in this example, $z=100$ ). The equation for the curve is $w \log w = z-x^2$ , and $z$ is assumed to be fixed. The equation can be re-written as $w = (z-x^2)/W(z-x^2)$ where $W$ is the Lambert function , which behaves asymptotically like the $\log$ function. Thus the number of points below the red curve is asymptotically (for large values of $z$ ) equal to $$r(z) \sim \int_0^\sqrt{z} \frac{z-x^2}{W(z-x^2)}dz \sim   \int_0^\sqrt{z} \frac{z-x^2}{\log(z-x^2)}dz = \frac{1}{2}\int_0^z \frac{u}{\sqrt{z-u}\cdot\log u}du.$$ Let us denote as $\phi(z)$ the function defined by the rightmost integral. We have $r(z) \sim \phi(z)$ . I computed the exact values of $r(z)$ and $\phi(z)$ for various small and large $z$ , and clearly, $r(z) \rightarrow C \cdot \phi(z)$ , but I am not sure if $C=1$ . See WolframAlpha computations here . The number of solutions to $z=x^2+y$ (with $y$ prime) is thus, on average, as $z$ gets larger and larger, asymptotically equivalent to $d\phi(z) / dz$ . Below is a table featuring $r(z)$ and $\phi(z)$ . Good asymptotic approximations for very large $z$ are $$\phi(z)\approx\frac{2}{3}\cdot \frac{z^{3/2}}{\log z} \mbox{ and }  \frac{d\phi(z)}{dz}\approx \frac{\sqrt{z}}{\log z}.$$ The last result is compatible with the one posted in the answer by Dietrich Burde, confirming that the approach I used here is sound. Note that the same methodology could be applied to sums of squares or sums of primes or any sums of integers. It is pretty generic. Final comment The number of solutions to $z = x^2 + y$ (with $y$ prime, $x$ an integer) is equal to $r(z)-r(z-1)$ . In all cases, $r(z)$ grows slowly (polynomial at most) and thus $r(z)-r(z-1) \sim dr(z)/dz$ . We could get deeper results with second- and third-order approximations in all the asymptotic results used in this article, rather than just first-order approximations. Below is a chart featuring the distribution for the number of solutions to $z=x^2+y$ [that is, the distribution of $r(z)-r(z-1)$ ]  for $700000\leq z < 740000$ . For instance, there are $441$ different $z$ 's between $z = 700000$ and $z = 740000$ for which $z=x^2 + y$ has exactly $50$ solutions. Below is the same chart, but for $100000\leq z < 140000$ . The two distributions are strikingly similar in shap2. Finally, among the first 750,000 $z$ 's, we have: $z = 78754$ is the last one to admit only one decomposition as $z =    x^2+y$ $z = 101794$ is the last one to admit exactly two decompositions $z = 339634$ is the last one to admit exactly three decompositions $z = 438166$ is the last one to admit exactly four decompositions $z = 383839$ is the last one to admit exactly five decompositions The $z$ 's that admit only one decomposition are listed below.

Any hints? As you can see in the comments, there is a solution for natural numbers, the problem is when the set is extended to integers solutions. *This is a problem for a national olympiad in my country, this olympiad usually puts all the solutions but i didn't found a solution for this problem in the page, i don't know why. Possible answer: Property: Be $A,B,C$ $\in \Bbb R$ $\ne 0$ such that $A+B=C$. Then exist $U,V \in {A,B,C}$ such that:  $$2|U| \gt 2|V| \ge |U|$$ Proof: Write $C'=-C$, then $A+B+C'=0$. The numbers $A,B,C \ne 0$ by hypothesis, and they can't be the three of the same sign because then they can't add $0$, so there are two of the numbers $A, B, C'$ that have the same sign and the other has a different sign. Amplifying the equality $A+B+C'= 0$ $\,$ by $-1$ if its necessary, we can assume that there are two of them (which we will call $X,Y$) that are positive and the third negative (we will call it $-Z$, with $Z\gt 0$). Then we have $Z=X+Y$ with $X,Y,Z \gt 0$ and that $X,Y,Z$ are equal to $|A|, |B| , |C|$ in some order. WLOG we can assume that $X\le Y$ , then: $$Z=X+Y\le 2Y \lt 2Y+2X = 2Z$$ Obtaining $2Z \gt 2Y \ge Z$ as we wanted. Solution: Assume that  $$(1): \; x^x+y^y=z^z$$ has integer solutions $\ne 0$, let $(x,y,z) = (a,b,c)$. According to the property, there exists integers $\ne 0$ $(u,v) \in (a,b,c)$ such that $2|u^u| \gt 2|v^v| \ge |u^u|$. Dividing by 2 and taking $\log$ we see that there are non-zero integers $(u,v)$ such that: $$u\log |u| \gt v\log |v| \ge u\log |u| - \log 2$$ That can be written as: $$(2): \;0 \lt u\log |u| - v\log |v| \le \log 2$$ The inequality (2) says that $u\log|u| \gt 0$ or $v\log|v| \lt 0$, but if $v \log |v| \lt 0$ then: $$u \log |u| - v \log |v| = (-v)\log|-v|\;-\;(-u)\log |-u|$$ with $(-v)\log|-v| \gt 0$, so unless we make a substitution, we can assume that $u \log |u| \gt 0$. In this case, necessarily $u \ge 2$, so   the second inequality of (2) says that: $$v \log |v| \ge u \log |u| - \log 2 \ge 2 \log 2 - \log 2 \gt 0$$ Matching this with the first equality of (2) we get: $$ log 2 \ge u \log |u| - v \log |v| \gt (v+1)\log |v| - v\log|v| = \log|v| \ge \log2$$ a contradiction.

85,"Intuition on an inductive proof of gcd Bezout identity (from Apostol: Math, Analysis 2ed)","Intuition on an inductive proof of gcd Bezout identity (from Apostol: Math, Analysis 2ed)",,"I've done proofs in discrete mathematics, but I'm still at the stage where proofs with more than a few steps make me uncomfortable. From Apostol's Mathematical Analysis [2nd Ed.] on page 5, we have Theorem 1.6. Every pair of integers $a$ and $b$ has a common divisor $d$ of the form $$ d = ax + by $$ where $x$ and $y$ are integers. Moreover, every common divisor of $a$ and $b$ divides this $d$ . The proof (with my questions throughout) goes as follows: Proof. First assume that $a \geq 0, b \geq 0$ and use induction on $n = a + b$ . If $n = 0$ then $a = b = 0$ , and we can take $d = 0$ with $x = y = 0$ . Assume, then, that the theorem has been proved for $0, 1, 2, ..., n - 1$ . I am a little confused about taking $n$ to be $a + b$ , since it's not obvious that all pairs $\{a, b\}$ would be covered by induction for all combinations of $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$ . By symmetry, we can assume $a \geq b$ . If $b = 0$ take $d = a, x = 1, y = 0$ . OK. If $b \geq 1$ we can apply the induction hypothesis to $a - b$ and $b$ , since their sum is $a = n - b \leq n - 1$ . Hence there is a common divisor $d$ of $a - b$ and $b$ of the form $d = (a - b)x + by$ . I'm going to let $a' = a - b$ , let $b' = b$ and let $d' = a'x + b'y$ . (I wish Apostol did something like this to make his proofs clearer.) I don't understand this logical step. Why does the fact that $a' + b' \leq n - 1$ imply that $d'$ exists and is a common divisor of $a'$ and $b'$ ? This seems like a huge leap. This $d$ also divides $(a - b) + b = a$ , so $d$ is a common divisor of $a$ and $b$ and we have $d = ax + (y-x)b$ , a linear combination of $a$ and $b$ . At this point I am clueless. Why does $d$ divide $a$ and why does this imply it also divides $b$ ? And where does Apostol get $y-x$ from?? To complete the proof we need to show that every common divisor divides $d$ . Since a common divisor divides $a$ and $b$ , it also divides the linear combination $ax + (y-x)b = d$ . This completes the proof if $a \geq 0$ and $b \geq 0$ . If one or both of $a$ and $b$ is negative, apply the result just proved to $|a|$ and $|b|$ . Why not just do the entire proof with absolute values from the beginning?

99,Using decimals of $\pi$ to store data,Using decimals of  to store data,\pi,"I read recently about an idea to, instead of storing actual data, converting the data to a string of digits and then store the index of where this pattern occurs in some number, for example $\pi$. The idea being that the index of the data would take up less storage space than the actual data. Of course, we don't know whether $\pi$ is a normal number and hence we do not know if every finite decimal pattern occurs, but let's assume for the moment that it does (or one simply changes to some proven normal number, like the Copeland-Erdős constant ). The thing that struck me was whether the index of the data might actually be a larger number than the data itself . Does there exist some measure of the probability of finding a decimal sequence of length $n$ before the $m$:th decimal place? For $\pi$ in this case, I doubt there's a general formula. Would it depend on the base? Information or references to other, similar ideas are also very welcome. (Yes, I understand that this method is very impractical for everyday use, I just found the idea intriguinng.)","I read recently about an idea to, instead of storing actual data, converting the data to a string of digits and then store the index of where this pattern occurs in some number, for example $\pi$.
