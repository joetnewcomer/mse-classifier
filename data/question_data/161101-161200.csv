Does it automatically follow that $\mu$ is regular? That is, for all Borel $E \subset X$, must we have $$\mu(E) = \inf \mu(U) = \sup \mu(K)$$ where the infimum is taken over open $U \supset E$ and the supremum is taken over compact $K \subset E$? I know this is true when $X$ is a metric space or, more generally, when every open subset of $X$ is $\sigma$-compact. I imagine this fails in general though. I have a proposed counterexample which is a long way from being complete, but I'll put it here anyway. Let $I$ be an uncountable index set. Denote the product of $I$ many copies of the discrete space $\{0,1\}$ by $2^I$ and give it the (compact) product topology.

So, I'm making this post for solution/proof-verification (it is not a duplicate) - I've come up with a measure on Borel sets of $\mathbb R$ corresponding to a compact set. Please help me fill in the gaps, if any. Prove that every compact subset of $\mathbb R^1$ is the support of a Borel measure. Here's my work: Suppose $A \subset \mathbb R$ is compact. Compact metric spaces are separable, so there exists a set $B = (b_n)_{n\in\mathbb N} \subset A$ which is dense in $A$ (i.e. $\overline B = A$ w.r.t. the subspace topology on $A$ ). Define $\mu$ on Borel sets of $\mathbb R$ as follows, where $\delta_p$ is the dirac measure at point $p\in\mathbb R$ . Note that $\delta_p(X) = 1$ if $p\in X$ and $\delta_p(X) = 0$ if $p\not\in X$ , for every $X\subset\mathbb R$ . Also we know that the support of $\delta_p$ is $\{p\}$ , and the support of a finite sum of measures is the (finite) union of their supports. If $C$ is a Borel set in $\mathbb R$ , $$\mu(C) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\delta_{b_n}(C)}{2^n}$$ To check that $\mu$ is a measure, we need to show that $\mu$ is countably sub-additive. I think it suffices to notice the countable sub-additivity of Dirac measures. Unfortunately, I'm unable to characterize the support of $\mu$ , because it is only in the finite case that we are allowed to union over the supports. However, I do feel that the above construction suffices. Could I please get some help in completing my proof? Thank you! Follow-up questions: What is special about Borel sets in this construction? Can we define $\mu$ over a larger $\sigma$ -algebra? There must be something special about Borel sets, otherwise, the statement would probably not be framed this way. How do we deal with the case when $K = \varnothing$ ? What's the corresponding measure? If $B$ is finite, I think we cannot work with the finite sum.

Note I am not asking about the triangle inequality of $L^p$ norm. (2) how can one show that $L^p(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, u)$ is a vector space? Thanks and regards!",,['measure-theory']

31,Invariance for translations of the Lebesgue measure,Invariance for translations of the Lebesgue measure,,"Let $T\colon\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ a linear trasformation of $\mathbb{R}$ defined as $Tx:=ax+b$ , where $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$ , $a\ne 0.$ We want to show the invariance for translations of the Lebesgue measure using the following result. Theorem. For all $E\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ we have $\lambda^*(T(E))=|a|\lambda^*(E);$ Notation. $\lambda^*$ is the Lebesgue outer measure, that is $$\lambda^*(E):=\inf\bigg\{\sum_{n=1}^{+\infty}\lambda_0(I_k)\;\bigg|\;\{I_n\}\subseteq\mathcal{I},E\subseteq\bigcup_{n=1}^{+\infty}I_n\bigg\},$$ where $\mathcal{I}$ is the algebra of plurintervals and $\lambda_0\colon\mathcal{I}\to [0,+\infty]$ is a measure definited as following: let $$\mathcal{I}_0=\{(a,b]\;|\;-\infty\le a\le b<+\infty)\}\cup\{(a,+\infty)\;|a\in\mathbb{R}\},$$ the family $\mathcal{I}$ consists of the finite disjoint unions of elements of $\mathcal{I}_0,$ then \begin{cases} \lambda_0(\emptyset):=0 \\ \lambda_0((a,b]):=b-a & \text{if $-\infty<a\le b<+\infty$}\\ \lambda_0((a,+\infty)):=+\infty &\text{if $a\in\mathbb{R}.$} \end{cases} Moreover, if $E\in\mathcal{I}\setminus\mathcal{I}_0$ $$\lambda_0(E):=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\lambda_0(E_k)$$ where $\{E_k\}_{k=1}^{n}\subseteq\mathcal{I}_0$ and $E=\bigcup_{k=1}^{n}E_k.$ $\mathcal{L}$ is the Lebesgue's $\sigma-$ algebra. Proof. We consider the linear transformations on $\mathbb{R}$ : $$T_1x:=\frac{a}{|a|}x,\quad T_2x:=|a|x,\quad T_3x:=x+b.$$ We observe that $T$ is the composition of $T_1,T_2$ and $T_3$ . In fact let $x\in\mathbb{R}$ , $$T_3T_2T_1x=T_3T_2\bigg(\frac{a}{|a|}x\bigg)=T_3(ax)=ax+b.$$ We start to prove that $\lambda^*(T_3(E))=\lambda^*(E).$ $(a)$ Let $\lambda^*(E)<+\infty.$ Then for $\varepsilon>0$ exists $\{I_k\}_{k\in\mathbb{N}}$ such that $$E\subseteq\bigcup_{k=1}^{+\infty} I_k\quad\lambda^*(E)+\varepsilon > \sum_{k=1}^{+\infty}\lambda_0(I_k).$$ Then $$T_3(E)\subseteq T_3\big(\bigcup_{k=1}^{+\infty} I_k\big)=\bigcup_{k=1}^{+\infty} T_3(I_k).$$ Therefore, $$\lambda^*(T_3(E))\le\sum_{k=1}^{+\infty}\lambda_0(T_3(I_k))\color{RED}{=}\sum_{k=1}^{+\infty}\lambda_0(I_k)<\lambda^*(E)+\varepsilon.$$ In the red equality we used the fact that for definition $\lambda_0$ is invariant for trasformation of type $T_3$ . Then for the arbitrariness of $\varepsilon$ we have that $\lambda^*(T_3(E))\le\lambda^*(E).$ Question 1. How can I show that $\lambda^*(T_3(E))\ge\lambda^*(E)$ ? $(b)$ Let $\lambda^*(E)=+\infty$ . We suppose for absurd that $\lambda^*(T_3(E))<+\infty$ , then exists $\{I'_k\}_{k\in\mathbb{N}}\subseteq\mathcal{I}$ such that $$T_3(E)\subseteq\bigcup_{k=1}^{+\infty}I'_k,\quad\sum_{k=1}^{+\infty}\lambda_0(I'_k)<\lambda^*(T_3(E))+\varepsilon<+\infty.$$ Since $E\subseteq\bigcup_{k=1}^{+\infty}\big[T_3^{-1}(I'_k)\big]$ we have $$\lambda^*(E)\le\sum_{k=1}^{+\infty}\lambda_0(T_3^{-1}(I'_k))\color{GREEN}{=}\sum_{k=1}^{+\infty}\lambda_0(I'_k)<+\infty,$$ absurd. Question 2. Why is the equality in green is valid? $$$$ Question 3. How can I formally show that $\lambda_0$ is invariant for transformations of the type $T_1, T_2, T_3$ ? In the same way it is shown that $\lambda^*(T_2(E))=|a|\lambda^*(E)$ and $\lambda^*(T_1(E))=\lambda^*(E).$ Therefore \begin{equation} \begin{split} \lambda^*(T(E))=&\lambda^*(T_3(T_2(T_1(E))\\ =&\lambda^*(T_2(T_1(E))\\ =&\lambda^*(T_1(E))\\ =&|a|\lambda^*(E) \end{split} \end{equation} Question 4. Is it true or false that $\lambda^*(T^{-1}(E))=|a|\lambda^*(E)$ ? How can I show it? My answer is false, but $$\lambda^*(E)=\lambda^*\big(T\big[T^{-1}(E)\big]\big)=|a|\lambda^*\big(T^{-1}\big(E\big)\big).$$ Therefore $\lambda^*\big(T^{-1}\big(E\big)\big)=\frac{1}{|a|}\lambda^*(E).$ Correct? Clarifications on the answer Thanks for the ansewer @астон вілла олоф мэллбэрг , but some doubts remain to me.  My book says to proceed this way $\lambda^*(T_1(E))=\lambda^*(E)$ , $\lambda^*(T_2(E))=|a|\lambda^*(E)$ , $\lambda^*(T_3(E))=\lambda^*(E).$ You explained to me that if $I\in\mathcal{I}$ , then $T_3(I)\in\mathcal{I}$ , moreover $\lambda_0$ is invariant under $T_3$ , then it is proved that $\lambda^*(T_3(E))\le\lambda^*(E),$ how can I show that $$\lambda^*(T_3(E))\ge\lambda^*(E)?$$ The same procedure can lead to show that $\lambda^*(T_2(E))=|a|\lambda^*(E)$ , with the necessary changes about $\lambda_0.$ Since $T_1(I)\notin\mathcal{I}$ , how can I show that $\lambda^*(T_1(E))=\lambda^*(E)?$ And finally how do I paste everything to show that $\lambda^*(T(E))=\lambda^*(E)$ ?

Unfortunately I'm struggling to deal with it. Well, I know that the integrand is a (measurable) function of the random variables $X,Y,X_2$ and $Y_2$ . So I saw the $L.H.S.$ of the above equality as $$\int_{\mathbb{R}^4}\int\int\Big[I(x_1\leq x)-I(x_2\leq x)\Big]\Big[I(y_1\leq y)-I(y_2\leq y)\Big]dxdy P_{X,Y,X_2,Y_2}(dx_1dy_1dx_2dy_2)$$ I don't know if this allows me to interchange the integrals to obtain \begin{align} &\int\int\ E\bigg\{\Big[I(X\leq x)-I(X_2\leq x)\Big]\Big[I(Y\leq y)-I(Y_2\leq y)\Big]\bigg\}dxdy\\ \end{align} If everything is alright so far, then I need to show that $E\bigg\{\Big[I(X\leq x)-I(X_2\leq x)\Big]\Big[I(Y\leq y)-I(Y_2\leq y)\Big]\bigg\}=2Cov(I(X\leq x),I(Y\leq y))$ , and the rest becomes straighforward to me. Thus I need to show (i) the independence of $I(X_2\leq x)\perp I(Y\leq y)$ and $I(X\leq x)\perp I(Y_2\leq y)$ given $X_2\perp Y$ and $X\perp Y_2$ ; and (ii) $E(I(Y\leq y))=E(I(Y_2\leq y))$ which is easy, and that $Cov(I(X\leq x),I(Y\leq y))=Cov(I(X_2\leq x),I(Y_2\leq y))$ .

UPDATE Since $X$ is independent of $Y_2$ , by definition, $\sigma(X)=\{X^{-1}(B):B\in \mathcal{B}_\mathbb{R}\}$ and $\sigma(Y_2)$ are independent, meaning that $P(A\cap B)=P(A)P(B), \ \forall A\in \sigma(Y_2), B\in \sigma(X)$ . Since $f=I_{(-\infty,x]}$ and $g=I_{(-\infty,y]}$ are $(\mathbb{R},\mathcal{B}_\mathbb{R})-(\mathbb{R},\mathcal{B}_\mathbb{R})$ measurable functions, then $(f\circ X)^{-1}=X^{-1}(f^{-1}(A))\in \sigma(X), \forall A\in \mathcal{B}_\mathbb{R}$ .

Hence $\sigma(f\circ X)$ and $\sigma(g\circ Y_2)$ are also independent. That is the indicator functions (measurable) preserve the independence of the random variables. Exploring one of the answers below, let $f,b:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ measurable functions (like the indicator functions I am interested in).

This immediately implies $Cov(f\circ X_2, g\circ Y_2)=Cov(f\circ X, g\circ Y)$ . Just put $f=I_{(-\infty,x]}$ and $g=I_{(-\infty,y]}$ .

Where may I read about them? $$\textbf{First Approach}$$ Starting with the premeasure $\mu$ defined only on boxes, and extending it into a measure through the follwing theorem: Carathéodory's Extension Lemma: let $\mu_0:\Sigma_0\to [0,\infty]$ be a pre-measure on the algebra $\Sigma_0$ of $X$ .

It is worth mentioning that -excluding the proof of the theorem above- this is the simplest construction I know of. However, both of the proofs I know of the theorem above (one found at the end of PWT, and the other one found here ) first use the pre-measure to construct an outer measure $\mu^*$ and then restrict the outer measure to Lebesgue measurable sets. $$\textbf{Second Approach}$$ Parting from the outer Lebesgue measure $\mu^*$ and restricting it through the following theorem: Carathéodory's Restriction Lemma: let $\mu^*:2^X\to [0,\infty]$ be an outer measure on the power set $2^X$ of $X$ . Then $\mu^*$ can be restricted to a measure $$\mu:\Sigma\to[0,\infty]$$ where $\Sigma := \Big\{ C \in 2^X : C \text{ is Caratheodory measurable} \Big\}$ and $\mu := \mu^*|_{\Sigma}$ . (I've never seen the 'Restriction Lemma' named as such, but I find the name appropriate). The approach may be found in Tao's An Introduction to Measure Theory (IMT), as well as Hunter's Measure Theory (MT). This approach is, I believe, the most common one, though it left me puzzled as to why the restriction was made to Carathéodory measurable sets specifically; some intuition may be found in this post or by studying equivalent (and more geometrically intuitive) definitions of Lebesgue measurable sets (as in Exercise 1.2.7 in IMT). $$\textbf{Third Approach}$$ Parting again from the Lebesgue outer measure $\mu^*$ , one defines Lebesgue measurable sets as those which can be 'approximated from above' by open sets arbitrarily well: Definition: a set $E\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ is Lebesgue measurable iff for every $\varepsilon>0$ there is some open set $U\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ containing $E$ such that $\mu^*(U\setminus E)<\varepsilon$ . Then the Lebesgue measure is characterized as the restriction of $\mu^*$ to Lebesgue measurable sets, and a bit of work shows that the collection of Lebesgue measurable sets is a $\sigma$ -algebra, as well as that $\mu$ is a measure.

66,Suspicious corollary of Lusin’s Theorem,Suspicious corollary of Lusin’s Theorem,,"Suppose $f : [0,1] \to \mathbb R$ is integrable. According to Lusin’s Theorem (as I understand it), for every $\epsilon > 0$ , there is a closed subset $C \subset [0,1]$ for which $f|_C : C \to \mathbb R$ is continuous and $\lambda([0,1] \setminus C) < \epsilon$ , where $\lambda$ is the Lebesgue measure on $[0,1]$ . Furthermore, if $B \subset [0,1]$ is open, then there is a closed $C’ \subset B$ for which $f_{C’} : C’ \to \mathbb R$ is continuous and $\lambda(B \setminus C’) < \epsilon$ . Playing with this, I arrived at the following corollary, which seems way too powerful to be true: Corollary: There is a subset $C \subset [0,1]$ of full measure, for which $f|_C : C \to \mathbb R$ is continuous (in the induced subspace topology on $C$ ). Proof. Let $C_1 \subset [0,1]$ be a closed set for which $f|_{C_1}$ is continuous, with $\lambda([0,1] \setminus C_1) < 2^{-1}$ , so $\lambda(C_1) > 2^{-1}$ . The existence of such a $C_1$ follows from Lusin’s Theorem. Now let $C_2 \subset [0,1] \setminus C_1$ be such that $f|_{C_2}$ is also continuous, and $\lambda\left(\left([0,1]\setminus C_1\right)\setminus C_2\right) < 2^{-2}$ , or $\lambda(C_1 \sqcup C_2) > 2^{-2}$ . The existence of $C_2$ also follows from Lusin’s theorem. Continuing in this way, we get a countable collection of disjoint closed sets $(C_n)_{n \geq 1}$ for which $f|_{C_n} : C_n \to \mathbb R$ is continuous for each $n$ , and for which $\lambda\left(C_1 \sqcup C_2 \sqcup \cdots \sqcup C_n\right) > 1-2^{-n}$ . By lower semicontinuity of $\lambda$ , denoting $C = \bigsqcup_{n\geq 1} C_n$ , we have $$ 1 \geq \lambda(C) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \lambda\left(\mathop{\bigsqcup}_{k=1}^n C_k\right) \geq \lim_{n \to \infty}(1-2^{-n}) = 1. $$ So $\lambda(C) = 1$ . and since $C$ is the countable disjoint union of closed sets, on each of which $f$ is continuous in the subspace topology, it follows that $f$ is continuous on $C$ in its subspace topology. QED. I don’t see an obvious flaw with this proof, but I find this hard to believe. The only place I can see an issue possibly is with the existence of $C_n$ for $n \geq 2$ using Lusin’s Theorem, but Lusin’s Theorem should hold on any Radon measure space $(X, \mathcal A, \mu)$ —in particular it should hold on any measurable subset of $[0,1]$ .

71,Most Markov chain definitions are false,Most Markov chain definitions are false,,"When introducing discrete, time-homogenouos Markov chains $(X_n)_{n\geq 0}$, a lot of introductory lecture notes simply seem to assume the existence of a probability measure $\mathbb{P}$  on the common domain $\Omega$ of the $X_n$, given the  distribution of $X_0$ and the transition matrix $T$. (We need $\mathbb{P}$  to talk about things like $$\mathbb{P}(X_7=u \land X_{23}=v)$$ resp. $$\mathbb{P}((X_n)_{n\geq 0}=(s_n)_{n\geq 0}),$$for some $u,v$ from the state space $S$ resp.  a sequence of values $(s_n)_{n\geq 0}$ ins $S$, a measure $\mathbb{P}$ is required.)

This theorem is interestingly is not yet on Wikipedia - only on the german Wikipedia .The theorem is way above my head to understand it, as it is formulated. My questions are: Do we really need this theorem? If most lectures notes gloss over it, perhaps it is trivial that $\mathbb{P}$ exists? Since the Ionescu-Tulcea theorem seems to apply for general Markov chains, does its statement (which I don't fully understand currently) and proof perhaps simplify significantly for discrete, time-homogenuous Markov chains (perhaps if we additionally assume a finite state space)? I'd be very happy, if I could understand it's proof.","When introducing discrete, time-homogenouos Markov chains $(X_n)_{n\geq 0}$, a lot of introductory lecture notes simply seem to assume the existence of a probability measure $\mathbb{P}$  on the common domain $\Omega$ of the $X_n$, given the  distribution of $X_0$ and the transition matrix $T$. (We need $\mathbb{P}$  to talk about things like $$\mathbb{P}(X_7=u \land X_{23}=v)$$ resp. $$\mathbb{P}((X_n)_{n\geq 0}=(s_n)_{n\geq 0}),$$for some $u,v$ from the state space $S$ resp.  a sequence of values $(s_n)_{n\geq 0}$ ins $S$, a measure $\mathbb{P}$ is required.) Only one set of lecture notes , out of many that I've consulted, have in passing mentioned that there is a thing such as the Ionescu-Tulcea theorem that shows that such probability measure $\mathbb{P}$ indeed exist (hence the title). This theorem is interestingly is not yet on Wikipedia - only on the german Wikipedia .The theorem is way above my head to understand it, as it is formulated.

For every sequence of rational numbers $\left\{ {{a}_{i}} \right\}_{i=1}^{\infty }$ and $1>p>0$ it is possible to construct the intervals $\left[ {{a}_{i}}-\delta _{i,n}^{-},{{a}_{i}}+\delta _{i,n}^{+} \right]$ such that $p=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}{{{\delta }_{n}}}=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}{\left( \delta _{i,n}^{+}-\delta _{i,n}^{-} \right)}$ and $\left[ {{a}_{i}}-\delta _{i,n}^{-},{{a}_{i}}+\delta _{i,n}^{+} \right]\cap \left[ {{a}_{j}}-\delta _{j,n}^{-},{{a}_{j}}+\delta _{j,n}^{+} \right]=\varnothing $.

84,Lebesgue Measure and Isometries on the Unit Square,Lebesgue Measure and Isometries on the Unit Square,,"This is a question I had on an exam from awhile ago and was rather curious about. ""Let $m$ denote the Lebesgue measure on the unit square $I^2 = [0,1]^2$. Define two mappings $S,T: I^2 \to I^2$ as follows: $S(x,y) = (y,x)$ and $T(x,y) = (x,\bar{y})$ where $\bar{y} = y + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ if $y \leq 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ and $\bar{y} = y + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - 1$ otherwise. Now suppose that $A \subset I^2$ is a measurable subset such that $S(A) = A$ and $T(A)=A$. Show that either $m(A) = 0$ or $m(A)=1$."" My thoughts/attempt: $S$ is a reflection of $I^2$ along the diagonal and $T$ is a translation of the $y$ coordinate ""up"" by $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$. But if it were to translate $y$ too far; i.e. leave $I^2$, it loops around so we can think of these isometries acting on a cylinder where we identify the top and bottom of the square. On the other hand, $STS(x,y) = ST(y,x) = (x + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},y)$ (or the other expression, depending on what $x$ is). So $STS$ is a horizonal translation which also loops around so now, it seems we should think of $S,T$ as isometries on the torus. Now, this set $A$ is invariant under both maps as is $m$ so it makes intuitive sense that it should be either measure-theoretic large or small. Since $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ is irrational, if we apply our horizontal or vertical translations to a point $p \in A$ and consider its orbit, I believe its orbit should be dense in $I^2$. So suppose that $0 < m(A)$. It seems like on the one hand, we can ""cover"" all of $I^2$ by translations of $A$ since $A$ has positive measure; i.e. its orbit should have full measure $1$. On the other hand, $A$ is invariant under $S,T$ so it equals its orbit. I'm just not clear on how to prove this rigorously. My hunch is to use something like Lebesgue density. The definition of the density of $A$ at a point $p$ is (when the limit exists) $$D_A(p) = \lim_{r \to 0}\frac{m(A \cap B(r,p))}{m(B(r,p))}.$$ The Lebesgue Density Theorem says that if $E \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is any Borel set, then for almost every point $p \in E$, $D_E(p) = 1$ and for almost every $p \notin E$, $D_E(p) = 0$. We can assume $E$ to be Borel as there is a theorem which basically allows us to write $E$ as some $G_\delta$ set minus a null set and $G_\delta$ sets are Borel. So let $p \in A$ be such a point where $D_A(p) = 1$. Let $\mathcal{O}(p)$ be the orbit set of $p$ under $S,T$. It seems that for each $q \in \mathcal{O}(p)$, $D_A(q) =1$ because we may take a small ball around $p$ and intersect that with $A$. Now apply some finite combination of $S,T$ to this intersection set; it is moved about but will still end up in the set $A$ and since these are rigid transformations, the measure of this intersection set should be the same. Moreover, this should hold for every small ball so the density ought to still be 1 around $q \in \mathcal{O}(p)$. But $\mathcal{O}(p)$ is dense in $I^2$, topologically. So for each point in a dense set in $I^2$, the Lebesgue density at that point is 1. Question: Can we conclude that since $$D_A(p) = \lim_{r \to 0}\frac{m(A \cap B(r,p))}{\pi r^2} = 1,$$ for sufficiently small $r$, for every $q \in \mathcal{O}(p)$, $m(A \cap B(r,q)) \approx \pi r^2$, for the same $r$? If so, can we say that the since the measure of $A$ locally is positive in a dense set, then $m(A) = 1$? Problem: If $q \in \mathcal{O}(p)$ happens to be a corner or edge point in the square, then maybe the density should be $\frac{1}{2}$ or $\frac{1}{4}$.","This is a question I had on an exam from awhile ago and was rather curious about.

On the other hand, $STS(x,y) = ST(y,x) = (x + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},y)$ (or the other expression, depending on what $x$ is). So $STS$ is a horizonal translation which also loops around so now, it seems we should think of $S,T$ as isometries on the torus. Now, this set $A$ is invariant under both maps as is $m$ so it makes intuitive sense that it should be either measure-theoretic large or small. Since $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ is irrational, if we apply our horizontal or vertical translations to a point $p \in A$ and consider its orbit, I believe its orbit should be dense in $I^2$. So suppose that $0 < m(A)$. It seems like on the one hand, we can ""cover"" all of $I^2$ by translations of $A$ since $A$ has positive measure; i.e. its orbit should have full measure $1$. On the other hand, $A$ is invariant under $S,T$ so it equals its orbit. I'm just not clear on how to prove this rigorously. My hunch is to use something like Lebesgue density. The definition of the density of $A$ at a point $p$ is (when the limit exists) $$D_A(p) = \lim_{r \to 0}\frac{m(A \cap B(r,p))}{m(B(r,p))}.$$ The Lebesgue Density Theorem says that if $E \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is any Borel set, then for almost every point $p \in E$, $D_E(p) = 1$ and for almost every $p \notin E$, $D_E(p) = 0$. We can assume $E$ to be Borel as there is a theorem which basically allows us to write $E$ as some $G_\delta$ set minus a null set and $G_\delta$ sets are Borel. So let $p \in A$ be such a point where $D_A(p) = 1$. Let $\mathcal{O}(p)$ be the orbit set of $p$ under $S,T$. It seems that for each $q \in \mathcal{O}(p)$, $D_A(q) =1$ because we may take a small ball around $p$ and intersect that with $A$. Now apply some finite combination of $S,T$ to this intersection set; it is moved about but will still end up in the set $A$ and since these are rigid transformations, the measure of this intersection set should be the same. Moreover, this should hold for every small ball so the density ought to still be 1 around $q \in \mathcal{O}(p)$. But $\mathcal{O}(p)$ is dense in $I^2$, topologically. So for each point in a dense set in $I^2$, the Lebesgue density at that point is 1. Question: Can we conclude that since $$D_A(p) = \lim_{r \to 0}\frac{m(A \cap B(r,p))}{\pi r^2} = 1,$$ for sufficiently small $r$, for every $q \in \mathcal{O}(p)$, $m(A \cap B(r,q)) \approx \pi r^2$, for the same $r$? If so, can we say that the since the measure of $A$ locally is positive in a dense set, then $m(A) = 1$? Problem: If $q \in \mathcal{O}(p)$ happens to be a corner or edge point in the square, then maybe the density should be $\frac{1}{2}$ or $\frac{1}{4}$.",,"['measure-theory', 'lebesgue-measure']"

Because $\mathcal{F}$ is dense in the uniform topology, $S_g^{N_k}(x)$ also converges for every $g \in \mathcal{C}(X, \mathbb{R})$. Let $S_g(x) = \lim_{k \to \infty} S_g^{N_k}(x)$. Let $L_x(g) = S_g(x)$. Then $L_x \colon \mathcal{C}(X, \mathbb{R}) \to \mathcal{R}$ is a continuous positive linear functional. By the Riesz representation theorem, there is a regular measure $\mu$ on $\mathcal{B}(X)$ such that $$L_x(g) = \int_X g d\mu$$ for every $g \in \mathcal{C}(X, \mathbb{R})$. A simple computation shows that $L_x(g \circ T) = L_x(g)$ for every $g \in \mathcal{C}(X, \mathbb{R})$, so $$\int_X g d\nu = \int_X g \circ T d\mu = \int_X g d\mu$$ for every $g \in \mathcal{C}(X, \mathbb{R})$, where $\nu = \mu(T^{-1}(\cdot))$. Since $\nu$ is a finite measure and $X$ is compact and metrizable, it follows that $\nu$ is also regular. This proves that $\mu = \nu$, so $\mu$ is $T$-invariant. My problem is that this proof doesn't seem to need the continuity of $T$, whereas there are examples that show that measurability alone isn't enough for the proof. What am I missing?

97,Absolute Continuity of Finite Borel Measure Characterized by Orthonormal Basis,Absolute Continuity of Finite Borel Measure Characterized by Orthonormal Basis,,"I've been working through Fundamentals of Stochastic Filtering (Bain, Crisan) and am a little perplexed by the following (initially) seemingly straightforward exercise and its given solution. We are given a certain finite Borel measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ and we wish to determine whether or not it is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure. The exercise purports the following: Let $\{\varphi_i\} _{i>0}$ be an orthonormal basis of $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d$ ) with the property that $\varphi_i$ is continuous and bounded for all $i$ . Let $\mu$ be a finite measure. If $$\sum_{i=1}^\infty \, \mu(\varphi_i)^2 <\infty $$ then $\mu$ is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure. Moreover, if $g_\mu$ is the density of $\mu$ with respect to Lebesgue measure, then $g_\mu \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ . The solution in the book goes as follows: we construct a density function, use it to define a new measure (which is necessarily absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure) and then show that this new measure is indeed the one we were given. Defining our density function $\bar{g_\mu} = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \, \mu(\varphi_i) \varphi_i$ , it is easy to see that this is in $L^2$ . Defining $\bar{\mu}$ to be the finite measure given rise to by this density, we see that $\bar{\mu}(\varphi_i) = \mu(\varphi_i)$ for all i. All well so good. The problem is showing that our wavelet basis $\{\varphi_i\}_{i>0}$ is a separating set of functions with respect to Borel measures on $\mathbb{R^d}$ , which would show that $\bar{\mu} = \mu$ . The book simply says: [...] via an approximation argument $\bar{\mu}(A) = \mu(A) $ for any ball A of arbitrary center and radius. Hence $\bar{\mu} = \mu$ . The issue I have here is making this approximation argument or any similar one work. The most obvious idea is to show that $ \bar{\mu}(f) =\mu(f)$ for any continuous bounded function $f$ . If we approximate naively $f$ in $L^2$ by functions in the span of our wavelet basis, this will also approximate the left hand side since we have absolute continuity between Lebesgue measure and $\bar{\mu}$ . However, the same cannot be said a priori about the right hand side. I note that the proposition supposed continuity of the wavelet functions, but this was never explicitly referred to in the proof. In fact, continuity must be necessary here, because it's easy to construct a counter example to this if the wavelets are allowed to be discontinuous (take $\mu$ to be Dirac measure at the origin, with any wavelet basis whose basis functions are modified to be zero at the origin). Being able to approximate in $L^2$ alone is clearly not strong enough - we need some uniform or uniform-like strength. Unfortunately though I can't think of any specific properties (such as their span forming an algebra) of general wavelets that would let us infer this. As I type this, it occurs to me that for the way this result is applied in the book, it is enough for it to hold for one particular choice of basis. Using finiteness of $\mu$ , it would be enough to exhibit existence of a wavelet basis that can uniformly approximate any given continuous $f$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ (or on any given compact interval/cube). I guess we could use truncated trigonometric base functions (truncation in the sense of domain) - allowing for uniform convergence on $...,[-1,0],[0,1],[1,2],...$ simultaneously (similarly for $\mathbb{R}^d$ . Now the wavelets are only piecewise continuous, but this is probably not a problem). For the time being I'll likely go with this makeshift approach, so I hope I haven't made any mistakes in my reasoning. For general continuous wavelets, is the original proposition true, I wonder. EDIT: It turns out that my above makeshift approach isn't going to work for proving the main result since I need the wavelets to have bounded partial derivatives up to second order.","I've been working through Fundamentals of Stochastic Filtering (Bain, Crisan) and am a little perplexed by the following (initially) seemingly straightforward exercise and its given solution.
