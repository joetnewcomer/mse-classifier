1,Different way to form the power set,Different way to form the power set,,"The power set can be constructed as a ""Cartesian product"" as in the following example. Suppose $S=\{a, b, c\}$ and that $\times$ is a modified Cartesian product operator (see following paragraph), then: $$Pset(S)=\{\emptyset,\{a\}\}\boxtimes \{\emptyset,\{b\}\} \boxtimes \{\emptyset,\{c\}\}$$ The difference being that the pairs of the product are actually unified together to make one set. For example, the pair $(\emptyset, \emptyset)$ yields $\emptyset$, the pair $(\emptyset, \{a\})$ yields $\{a\}$. Does this operation have a standard name/notation? I want to prove that the resulting set is actually the power set but I need notation or try to introduce appropriate notation. Note: This construction tells us that the cardinality is $2^{|S|}$ right away which is true.","The power set can be constructed as a ""Cartesian product"" as in the following example.

Please correct my terminology if it is incorrect so that I can speak coherently about this answer, if you would. Sequential infinite set: A group of ordered items that flow in a straight line, of which there are infinitely many. So, all integers from least to greatest would be an example, because they are ordered from least to greatest in a sequential line, but an infinite set of bananas would not, since they are not linearly, sequentially ordered.

Sequential infinite subsets: Multiple sets within a sequential infinite set that naturally fall into the same order as the items of the sequential infinite set of which they are subsets. So, for example, the infinite set of all integers from least to greatest can be said to have the following two sequential infinite subsets within it: all negative integers; and all positive integers. They are sequential because the negative set comes before the positive set when ordered as stated. They are infinite because they both contain an infinite qty of items, and they are subsets because they are within the greater infinite set of all integers.

Then show that  a bijection,A B B\subset A. f:A\to B \exists h:A\to B.,"Suppose $A$ and $B$ are two sets with $B\subset A.$ Let $f:A\to B$ be injective. Then show that $\exists$ a bijection $h:A\to B.$ The proof given was : Let $$X=(A-B)\cup f(A-B)\cup  f^2(A-B)\cup \cdots=\bigcup_{n=0}^{\infty}f^n(A- B);f^0(A-B)=A-B.$$ Then clearly if $x\in X,x\in f^n(A-B)$ for some $n.$ Then $f(x)\in f^{n+1}(A-B)\implies f(x)\in X.$ Thus, $f(X)\subset X.$ We define, $$h:A\to B$$ by $$h(x)=f(x)\text{, if }x\in X,$$ $$x\text{ otherwise. }$$ To show that $h$ is one-one, let $x,y\in A$ and $h(x)=h(y).$ If $x,y\in X$ then $f(x)=f(y)\implies x=y$ If $x,y\in A-X$ then, $x=y,$ by definition of $h.$ If $x\in X$ and $y\in A-X$ then $$h(x)=h(y)\implies f(x)=y\implies y\in f(X)\subset X,$$ a contradiction. So, the last case can't occur. Thus, $h$ is one-one. To show that $h$ is onto, let $y\in B.$ If $y\in X$ then $y\in f^n(A-B)$ for some $n\geq 1\implies y=f^n(x),$ for some $x\in A-B$ $$\implies y=f(x')$$ where $x'=f^{n-1}(x)\in f(A-B)\subset X.$ $$\implies y=h(x').$$ If $y\notin X$ thhen, $h(y)=y.$ Thus, $h$ is onto. This completes the proof. However, I find this proof much convoluted,  which was not at all necessary. I tried devising an alternative proff, which is quite straight-foerward in it's working and might even be considered simpler. Here it is : Notation: If S is a set, then by $|S|$ I mean, Cardinality of the set $S$ Given, $B$ is a  subset of $A$ and $f:A\to B$ is an injective mapping. Since, $B$ is a subset of $A,$ we have, $|B|\leq |A|.$ Also, $f$ is an injective mapping from $A$ to $B$ implies, $|A|\leq |B|.$ Hence, $|A|=|B|$ is the only  possible conclusion. Again, as $f$ is an injection from $A$ to $B$ (and with the (now) established fact that, $|A|=|B|,$ ) $f$ is a bijection. Thus, $f=h$ and $h:A\to B$ is a bijection. I hope that  my  alternative approach is a correct one. Is there any way, I can improve the proof? I am looking, for some specific suggestions that might make my proof look more readable and understandable. Any suggestions/remarks against ways of improving it, will be highly appreciated.

63,How to use $\uparrow$ to define an explicit bijective mapping $f:\varepsilon_{1}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$?,How to use  to define an explicit bijective mapping ?,\uparrow f:\varepsilon_{1}\rightarrow\mathbb{N},"The map $f:\varepsilon_{1}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$ which I am trying to define has to send $\varepsilon_{0}$ to some natural number. Since $\varepsilon_{0}=\omega\uparrow^{2}\omega$ , a potential candidate is $f(\varepsilon_{0})=P_{f(f(\omega))}=P_{f(3)}=P_{8}=19$ (from the calculations for small ordinals below). More generally, $f((\omega\uparrow^{n}\alpha)\cdot k) = P_{f^{n}(\alpha)}^{k}$ , where $n,k$ are finite, $f^{n}$ is simply $f$ composed with itself $n$ times, and $P_{i}$ denotes the $i$ -th prime. Some small ordinals will be mapped as follows: $f(0)=1$ , $f(1)=f(\omega\uparrow^{1}0)=P_{f(0)}=P_{1}=2$ , and more generally, $f(m)=f((\omega\uparrow^{1}0)\cdot m)=2^{m}$ , $m\ge 1$ . Finally, $f(\omega) = f(\omega\uparrow^{1}1)=P_{f(1)}=P_{2}=3$ . Am I going in the right direction? UPDATE: Something bothers me: $f$ may not well defined because the $\uparrow$ does not produce a unique notation. For example, $\omega=\omega\uparrow^{1} 1 = \omega\uparrow^{2} 1$ . Is there a way to avoid this pitfall? Perhaps, when an ordinal $\alpha$ can be denoted by several expressions, we take the smallest of the resulting numbers after applying $f$ to each of the expressions denoting $\alpha$ ?

65,Reasoning behind intuitive understanding of specific equivalence class $a \sim b \iff f(a) = f(b)$,Reasoning behind intuitive understanding of specific equivalence class,a \sim b \iff f(a) = f(b),"I was attempting this question the other day: Let $f:A \rightarrow B$ be a surjective map of sets. Prove the relation $$a \sim b \iff f(a) = f(b)$$ is an equivalence relation whose equivalence classes are the fibres of $f$ . In principle this is easy to solve. Reflexivity, Symmetry and Transitivity are all straightforward since $f(a) = f(a)$ $f(a) = f(b) \iff f(b) = f(a)$ $f(a) = f(b) \wedge f(b) = f(c) \rightarrow f(a) = f(c)$ Any fibre of $f$ is $\{a\in A|f(a) = b\}$ and since the right inverse $h$ exists, $b$ can be written as $f(c)$ . $f(a) = f(c) \iff a\sim b$ . Simple enough? Except this all sounded a little too straightforward and I couldn't really understand in particular how the equivalence classes are the same as the fibres of $f$ . So I thought up this lil visual representation. All the elements of $B$ are occupied i.e. the codomain is the range. Sometimes multiple elements of $A$ point towards a single element of $B$ . That is allowed by our required surjectivity. Now every time $f(x) = f(y)$ for two elements $x,y \in A$ , $x \sim y$ . $x$ and $y$ share an equivalence class by this definition.

In particular, I still do not understand why $f$ must be surjective because while it was an integral part of the proof, I could always add a few extra harmless elements to $B$ , invalidating the surjective property of $f$ , and the equivalence classes would remain the fibres of $f$ .","I was attempting this question the other day: Let be a surjective map of sets.

I am aware of Schur's theorem, which has a relatively similar statement, but it is actually for numbers in a set with their sum, while this problem is for sets in a 'family' with their union. I'm thinking to create a bijective indicator, that transforms each of the elements of $S \in \mathcal{P(n)}$ into a natural number $\omega(S)$ , indicator function that also have the property that for distinct sets: $$\omega(A) + \omega(B) = \omega(A \cup B)$$ Actually, If I proved this, I would have solved the problem since Schur's theorem may be used. However, I couldn't find a proof for this fact on a general case. For example, a valid (satisfies the definition conditions, but does not form a correct Schur-type set) function for $n = 3$ would be: $\omega(\emptyset) = 0$ , $\omega(\{1\}) = 1$ , $\omega(\{2\}) = 3$ , $\omega(\{3\}) = 5$ , $\omega(\{1, 2\}) = 4$ , $\omega(\{1, 3\}) = 6$ , $\omega(\{2, 3\}) = 8$ and $\omega(\{1, 2, 3\}) = 9$ .","Prove that there exists a natural for each natural such that, by coloring all the subsets of with colors, there exist two disjoint subsets among them, and , such that are identically colored.
