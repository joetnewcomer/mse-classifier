This ring is the direct limit of $\mathbb{C}[x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_n] \rightarrow \mathbb{C}[x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_{n+1}]$ with the natural inclusions, so the corresponding projective scheme should be the inverse limit of the $\mathbb{CP}^n$. (This isn't quite true because the maps aren't actually maps of graded rings, and only induce rational maps on the projective spaces, but it at least works in the affine category: $\text{Spec } \mathbb{C}[x_0, x_1, \ldots]$ is a variety over $\mathbb{C}$ with points given by arbitrary infinite sequences of numbers in $\mathbb{C}$, which is the inverse rather than direct limit of the affine spaces). What happens if we take $\text{Proj } R$ (or if it's easier, $\text{Spec } R$), where $R$ is the inverse limit of $\mathbb{C}[x_1, \ldots, x_{n+1}] \rightarrow \mathbb{C}[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ given by $x_{n+1} \mapsto 0$? The inverse system corresponds to the direct system of $\mathbb{CP}^n$ given above, but perhaps the limit does not give quite the right thing. The MO post here discusses this problem, mentioning why $\text{Proj } \mathbb{C}[x_0, \ldots]$ doesn't work, but it does not say what goes wrong when you take $\text{Proj } R$ EDIT I believe $R$ can be described as follows: elements of $R$ are infinite sums of monomials of finite degree in the $x_i$, such that for any $n$, the set of non-zero terms involving $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ is finite.",,"['algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-topology', 'category-theory', 'projective-space']"

I tried to modify a proof I gave before for the affine case. If $X\subset P^n$ is a projective variety, it is the vanishing set of some homogenous polynomials $G_j$ in $n+1$ variables. The regular map $\phi: X \rightarrow P^m$ is of the form $[\phi_0([X_0:\ldots:X_n]):\ldots: \phi_m([X_0:\ldots:X_n])]$, where each $\phi_i$ is regular on $X$. Call the graph of regular map $\phi$,  $\Gamma= \{[x:\phi(x)]:x\in X\} \subset P^n\times P^m$. To show that this graph is a variety, we can exhibit a set of polynomials who zero-locus is $\Gamma$. Consider the set of polynomials $S = \{G_j\} \cup \{ x_{n+i}-\phi_i\}$ where $i=0,\ldots, m$ and its vanishing set $V(S)$. First we show $\Gamma \subset V(S)$. Take some element $[x:\phi(x)]$ in $\Gamma$, by definition $x\in X$ so we know first $n+1$ coordinates of $x$ satisfy all the $G_j$ and the last $m+1$ coordinates satisfy them trivially as they do not appear. We need to see that $x$ satisfy the other $m$ polynomial. The polynomials $x_{n+i}-\phi_i$ are trivially satisfied by the definition of the graph thus $\Gamma \subset V(S)$. So we check $\Gamma \supset V(S)$. Satisfying the $x_{n+i}-\phi_i$ polynomials guarantees we are on the bigger graph $\Gamma' = \{(x,f(x)):x\in P^n\}$ and the other polynomials $G_i$ intersect the first $n$ coordinates with $X$ as a subspace, thus giving $\Gamma$. To see that $\Gamma$ is irreducible if $X$ is, we can look at the ideals of the polynomials. We know the ideal generated by $\{G_j\}$ is prime, and  the ideal generated by $\{-\phi_i+x_{n+i}\}$ are all prime because of the $x_{n+i}$ term being irreducible and degree 1. Since the ideal generators do not intersect, the ideal generated by their union is still prime and therefore the graph is irreducible. Two issues I have: the set $S$ needs to be all homogenous polynomials, and the $-\phi_i+x_{n+i}$ are clearly not since $x_{n+i}$ is degree 1 and $\phi_i$ can be any degree. I was thinking of raising $x_{n+1}$ to the degree of $\phi_i$ but I am not sure that would fix anything. Also, then my argument about irreducibility would not work. To be frank, I am not full convinced it works, but I tried several examples and it seems to be the case that if you have generates $S_i$ for a prime ideal and generators $T_i$ for a prime ideal and if $\{S_i\}\cap \{T_i\}=\emptyset$ then $\{S_i\}\cup \{T_i\}$ generates a prime ideal.","I am trying to show that if $X$ is an irreducible projective variety, its graph under a regular map into projective space is an irreducible subvariety [Harris Ex 2.24].

If $X$ is an $n$-dimensional (complex dimension) smooth projective variety and $h\in H^{2}(X)$ is the [complex de Rahm] cohomology [= singular cohomology tensor $\mathbb{C}$, I hope] class corresponding to a hyperplane section, then the cup product induces isomorphisms $$ (-) \cup h^{k} \colon  H^{n-k}(X) \to H^{n+k}(X) $$ We can take Poincaré duals and visualize this as intersecting with an hyperplane.

81,Problem in a proof of Hartshorne,Problem in a proof of Hartshorne,,"My issue is in Theorem 8.8 and Lemma 8.9 of Chapter II concerning Kähler differentials. I have managed to ""relax"" Lemma 8.9 as follows : Let $A$ be a noetherian local integral domain with residue field $k$ and quotient field $K$. If $M$ is a finitely generated $A$-module and if $r = \dim_k M \otimes_A k \le \dim_K M \otimes_A K$, then the inequality is an equality and $M$ is free of rank $r$. The proof is exactly the same as outlined in Hartshorne, since the inequality is sufficient to complete the proof (the surjectivity of $K^r \to M \otimes_A K$ with $\dim_K M \otimes_A K \ge r$ shows that it has to be injective and the dimensions need to be equal). My problem comes in the proof of Theorem 8.8 : Let $B$ be a local ring containing a field $k$ isomorphic to its residue field (I noticed afterwards that they more precisely mean that the map $k \to B \to B/\mathfrak m$ is a field isomorphism). Assume furthermore that $k$ is perfect, and that $B$ is the localization of a finitely generated $k$-algebra. Then $\Omega_{B/k}$ is a free $B$-module of rank equal to $\dim B$ if and only if $B$ is a regular local ring. It is assumed that $B$ is the localization of a finitely generated $k$-algebra, say $A$. Let us assume for simplicity that $A$ is a domain (since it is an admissible context in the hypotheses). The theorem claims that $\Omega_{B/k}$ is free of rank $\dim B$ if and only if $B$ is a regular local ring. The proof goes fine until they claim that $\dim B = \mathrm{tr.deg}(K/k)$ ; this equality is false in general since it doesn't hold when $B = A_{\mathfrak p}$ where $\mathfrak p \in \mathrm{Spec}(A)$ is not maximal, because  $$ \dim(A_{\mathfrak p}) = \mathrm{ht}(\mathfrak p) < \dim A = \mathrm{tr.deg}(K/k) $$  (that last equality is using the Theorem (I,1.8A) that Hartshorne quoted directly after) and $K = Q(A) = Q(A_{\mathfrak p})$. But we still have $\dim B \le \mathrm{tr.deg}(K/k)$. A mistake in a book, I could live with it and try to find the proof. But here's where I get confused. Using that inequality and the rest of the proof, we get $$ \dim_k \Omega_{B/k} \otimes_B k = \dim_k \mathfrak m/\mathfrak m^2 = \dim B \le \mathrm{tr.deg}(K/k) = \dim_K \Omega_{K/k} = \dim_K \Omega_{B/k} \otimes_B K, $$ from which it follows that $\dim_k \Omega_{B/k}\otimes_B k= \dim_K \Omega_{B/k} \otimes_B K$ by the Lemma, and in particular that $\dim B = \mathrm{tr.deg}(K/k)$.

93,$\mathcal{O}_X(D)$ is invertible implies $D$ is locally principal,is invertible implies  is locally principal,\mathcal{O}_X(D) D,"With words added for context, 14.2.G of Ravil Vakil's notes asks Suppose $X$ is an integral, normal and Noetherian scheme, and $D$ a Weil divisor. Let $\mathcal{O}_X(D)$ be the quasicoherent sheaf defined by  \begin{align*} \Gamma(U,\mathcal{O}_X(D)) :=\{t\in K(X)^{\times}: {\rm div}|_U t + D|_U\geq 0\}\cup \{0\}\}. \end{align*}  Suppose in addition that $\mathcal{O}_X(D)$ is invertible. (a) Let $s$ be the rational section of $\mathcal{O}_X(D)$ corresponding to the function $1\in K(X)$ in the defintion above. Show that ${\rm div}(s)=D$. (To clarify what $s$ is, we can see that 1 is a section of $\mathcal{O}_X(D)$ away from the support of $D$. If referring to it as ""1"" is confusing, Vakil uses the notation $\sigma(1)$, where $\sigma$ takes $f\in K(X)$ and outputs a rational section. More generally, if $f\in K(X)$, then $\sigma(f)$ is a section of $\mathcal{O}_X(D)$ away from the poles of $f$ and the support of $D$. We can compute the divisor of $\sigma(f)$ by taking local trivializations.) (b) Show that $D$ is locally principal. I think I see how (a) and (b) are equivalent, and I have tried to do (b) directly by taking an open set $U$ over which $\mathcal{O}_X(D)$ is trivial, and fixing an isomorphism $\mathcal{O}_X|_U\rightarrow \mathcal{O}_X(D)|_U$. Then, we can let $s$ be the image of 1, and try to get a contradiction if ${\rm div}(s)|_U>-D|_U$ by finding a section that is not a multiple of $s$. For example, if given an integral, noetherian, and normal ring $A$, a height 1 prime is never contained in the union of the remaining height 1 primes, I think this approach can work. However, I think I am just missing something obvious. How do we prove (a) directly, as the exercise intends? (This is not homework, and I'm mainly hoping for a good way to understand why (b) is true.)","With words added for context, 14.2.G of Ravil Vakil's notes asks Suppose $X$ is an integral, normal and Noetherian scheme, and $D$ a Weil divisor.
