12,Does the curvature determine the metric for all surfaces,Does the curvature determine the metric for all surfaces,,"In order to not make things even more confusing than they are, I split my two-in-one question into two parts. Here's the second part (the first part is here ): Here I asked the question whether the curvature deterined the metric. At the MO page (as cited above) I got the following answer to the question Given a compact Riemannian manifold M, are there two metrics g1 and g2, which are not everywhere flat, such that they are not isometric to one another, but that there is a diffeomorphism which preserves the curvature? If the answer is yes: Can we chose M to be a compact 2-manifold? For concrete 2-dimensional counter-example see page 328 of Kulkarni's paper ""Curvature and metric"", Annals of Math, 1970. Weinstein's argument there shows that every Riemannian surface provides a counter-example (using flow orthogonal to the gradient of the curvature). Here is the Weinstein's argument: Consider a Riemannian surface $(S,g)$ and let $K$ denote the curvature function. Let $X$ be a nonzero vector field on $S$ orthogonal to the gradient field of $K$. (Such $X$ always exists.) Now, consider the flow $F_t$ along $X$. Then $F_t$ will preserve the curvature but will not be (for most metrics $g$ and vector fields $X$) isometric. For instance, $F_t$ cannot be isometric if genus of $S$ is at least $2$ or if $X$ has more than 2 zeros. Since I am unfortunately completely new to Riemannian geometry, I wanted to ask, if somebody could explain that to me in detail, maybe with the help of a concrete example. Also I don't understand, why this actually answers my question, since it seems that we have only one metric (and not two) in Weinstein's counter-example for calculating the gradient.

Please try to look at the problem from the perspective of someone learning this topic for the first time. For future reference let $f:M \rightarrow N$ be a smooth function where $M$ and $N$ are smooth manifolds. Let the derivative of $f$ at $p\in M$ be denoted as the usual $df_p:T_pM \rightarrow T_{f(p)}N$ . Question: In what ways is it advantageous to define $df_p$ in a coordinate free way? I cannot see the motivation behind such a definition. To me there are three defining characteristics of the derivative at a point of a function between $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbb{R}^m$ . The derivative of a function offers an approximate relationship between perturbations of the input and corresponding perturbations of the output. This relationship is linear. This approximation is better than any other linear approximation. Let's check how many of these properties actually survive the abstraction process needed for a coordinate free generalization of the derivative on manifolds. Property 1: To interpret a tangent vector as a ""perturbation"" of the point p, we would need some sort of canonical mapping from $T_pM$ to $M$ . I do not know of any such mapping which doesn't rely on a local coordinates. Since we can't interpret the inputs and outputs of $df_p$ as perturbations, I assume that the notion of local approximation is abandoned as well. How could $df_p$ ""approximate"" $f$ when we don't even have a way to relate their respective domains and ranges. Thus I will assume that this property of the derivative has been stripped away in the abstraction process. Property 2: This is satisfied. Property 3: Since we have determined that without coordinates $df_p$ does not act as an approximation of $f$ , it cannot be the ""best"" approximation. Thus only one property survives. $df_p$ seems to be (to my unexperienced eyes) a glorified linear mapping with no substantial importance until local coordinates are introduced. Thus why don't we simply define the derivative in a coordinate dependent manner? This would also make the definition of the tangent space much simpler. The ""geometric tangent space"", $\mathbb{R}^n_p$ , as defined in Lee's ""Smooth Manifolds"" would suffice as a definition since we are assuming some coordinate representation. Is anything lost by doing this? In response to nicrot000’s answer: To summarize, nicrot000 states in his answer that it is the general trend of differential geometry to express concepts in coordinate free ways. This allows said concepts to be independent of arbitrary decisions (i.e. choice of local coordinates). /end of summary\ I guess my question is rooted in the fact that I’m not convinced arbitrary decisions are a bad thing in terms of defining the derivative. From my perspective, $df_p$ can only be interpreted in some meaningful way after local coordinates have been assumed. An analogy: Suppose we have a computer which we will refer to as the “idea machine”. The sole purpose of this computer is to run a program which, on command, generates a random idea. After you have clicked “generate idea”, the program will prompt you to choose from a set of languages (all of which can be “smoothly” translated between each other) in which the idea will be displayed on the screen (the choice of a language corresponds to choosing a local coordinate chart). There is however the option to choose no language (corresponding to coordinate free). If no language is chosen, nothing will be displayed on the screen and the idea will forever stay encoded by the ones and zeros in the hardware. We do however know that the idea exists independent of our arbitrary choice of language (hooray!). At the end of the day, if we want to know what the idea was then in some form or another we would have to use a “language” to interpret the ones and zeros in the hardware.

First, this is the definition of an abstract manifold we once used in a lecture: Definition . Let $M$ be metric space and $\left(V_{i}\right)_{i\in I}$ be an open cover of $M$ with open sets $U_i\subset\mathbb R^m$ and homeomorphisms $F_i: U_i\rightarrow V_i$ . Then we say $M$ is an (abstract) $m$ -dimensional $C^k$ manifold if for all two open sets $V_1$ , $V_2\subset M$ with maps $F_1$ and $F_2$ the transition map $$F_{2}^{-1}\circ F_1: \quad F_1^{-1}(V_1 \cap V_2) \rightarrow F_{2}^{-1}(V_1\cap V_2)$$ is a $C^k$ diffeomorphism.

Question : I was asking myself whether $M = \mathbb R^m$ itself is an abstract $m$ -dimensional $C^k$ manifold and to what degree $k$ it is.

The first part of the proof proves the theorem in the case $M$ is compact. Then according to the errata of the book, this argument applies to the case when $M$ is an arbitrary compact subset of a larger manifold $\tilde{M}$ with or without boundary, by covering $M$ with finitely many coordinate balls or half-balls for $\tilde{M}$ . The result is a smooth injective map $F:M\to \mathbb{R}^{nm+m}$ whose differential is injective at each point.

To establish my criteria let me define immersed and embedded submanifolds: A subset $N\subset M$ is an immersed submanifold when $N$ is itself a manifold and $\iota:N\rightarrow M$ is an (injective) immersion. In the same way, a subset $N\subset M$ is an embedded submanifold if the inclusion is an embedding. By theorem 5.8 of John M. Lee's book Introduction to smooth manifolds , any subset $N$ of a smooth manifold $M$ such that each point $p\in N$ is contained in the domain of a chart $(U,\varphi)$ of $M$ verifying $$ \varphi(U\cap N)= V \times \{ c \}, $$ for $V\subset\mathbb R^k$ open and $c\in \mathbb R^{n-k}$ constant, is a topological submanifold of $M$ and it admits a smooth structure making it into a $k$ -dimensional embedded submanifold. Conversely, any embedded submanifold exhibits such a property. On the other hand, Proposition 5.22 of the same book states that if $N\subset M$ is an immersed submanifold then, for each point $p\in N$ there is an open neighbourhood (with respect to $N$ ) $U'$ of $p$ such that $U$ is an embedded submanifold.

99,How to obtain the standard basis for $\mathbb{R}^2$ using differential geometry?,How to obtain the standard basis for  using differential geometry?,\mathbb{R}^2,"I apologize in advance because I don't know how to enter code to format equations, and I apologize for how elementary this question is. I am trying to teach myself some differential geometry, and it is helpful to apply it to a simple case, but that is where I am running into a wall. Consider $M=\mathbb{R}^2$ as our manifold of interest. I believe that the tangent space is also $\mathbb{R}^2$. From linear algebra, we know that a basis set for $\mathbb{R}^2$ is $$\left\{\left[\matrix{1\\0}\right], \left[\matrix{0\\ 1}\right] \right\}\;.$$ Now, from differential geometry, we are told that basis vectors are $\frac{d}{dx}$ and $\frac{d}{dy}$ where the derivatives are partial deravatives. So my question is how does one obtain a two-component basis vector of linear algebra from a simple partial derivative? EDIT: Thanks to everyone for the replies. They have been very helpful, but thinking as a physicist, I would like to see how the methods of differential geometry could be used to derivive the standard basis of linear algebra. It seems that there must be more to it than saying that there is an isomorphism between the space of derivatives at a point and R^n which sets up a natural correspondence between the basis vectors. I may be completely off-the-wall wrong, but somehow I think that the answer involves partial derivatives of a local orthognal coordinate system at point p.","I apologize in advance because I don't know how to enter code to format equations, and I apologize for how elementary this question is.
