8,First Isomorphism Theorem - hole in the proof from my book?,First Isomorphism Theorem - hole in the proof from my book?,,"I have a book that contains a proof for their so-called ""First Isomorphism Theorem"", which esentially states that if $f$ is a surjective group morphism $f:G\to G'$ and $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ , then $G/H$ is isomorphic to $G'/f(H)$ . Their proof goes like this: They consider $\pi: G' \to G'/f(H)$ to be the canonical map, $\pi(x) = xf(H)$ , which is surjective. Then they take $f':G\to G'/f(H), \ f'=\pi \circ f$ . Since $f$ and $\pi$ are surjective, $f'$ is also surjective. Thus, by a previously proven theorem in the book (called the 'Fundamental Isomorphism Theorem'), we have that $G/\ker f'$ is isomorphic to $G'/f(H)$ . Now they go on to prove that $\ker f' = H$ in order to finalize the proof. The following sequence of equivalences holds: $x \in \ker f' \Leftrightarrow \pi(f(x)) = 1 \Leftrightarrow f(x) \in \ker \pi = f(H)$ . (the $1$ here is the unity for $G'/f(H)$ , so $f(H)$ ).

(i.e: does not imply and are conjugate) Are there other properties conjugate elements share -- properties that and share if and only if they are conjugate? To be clear, I understand why conjugacy is important in certain examples. For instance: In , for example, if two matrices are conjugate then they have the same rank, nullity, trace, determinant, and so on. In , two permutations are conjugate if and only if they have the same cycle type. But in a general group , I cannot see why saying "" and are conjugate"" is significant / what it tells us. Any clarification would be much appreciated. Thanks!","|x| = |y| x y x y GL(n, \mathbb{F}) S_n G x y","['group-theory', 'finite-groups', 'intuition']"

I believe I have a proof, but my proof relies on $G$ being Abelian.  In the context I encountered this, every group under consideration was Abelian, but this statement was given without specifying that either group was Abelian.  My question is whether the Abelian condition is necessary.  If not, can someone provide a proof of this more general fact, and if so, can someone provide a counter-example?  If I'm correct that $G$ being Abelian is necessary, then does anyone have a cleaner proof than the nastiness I've provided below? A quick sketch of my proof is included below.  Note that I'm a little loose with notation using $+$ for both the operations in $G$ and $H$ and I haven't written out all the details.  I hope this is still clear enough to get the idea: Consider the map $f :  H \oplus \ker \psi \rightarrow G$ defined by $f(\left<h, k\right>) = \phi(h) + k$ .  I claim $f$ is an isomorphism.  First, if $\left<h_1, k_1\right>$ and $\left< h_2, k_2 \right>$ are elements of $H \oplus \ker \psi$ , then $f(\left<h_1, k_1\right> + \left< h_2, k_2 \right>) = f(\left< h_1 + h_2, k_1 + k_2\right>) = \phi(h_1 + h_2) + k_1 + k_2 = \phi(h_1) + \phi(h_2) + k_1 + k_2$ .  If $G$ is Abelian, we can continue: $\phi(h_1) + \phi(h_2) + k_1 + k_2 = \phi(h_1) + k_1 + \phi(h_2) + k_2 = f(\left<h_1, k_1\right>) + f(\left<h_2, k_2\right>)$ , so $f$ is a homomorphism.  Further, $f$ is injective since $\phi(h) + k = 0$ implies $\phi(h) = -k$ , so $\psi(\phi(h)) = \psi(-k) = 0 = h$ using that $\psi \circ \phi = Id_{h}$ and $k \in \ker \psi$ .

THe proof goes as follows: Let $G$ be a subgroup of order 224 and $S$ be the set of $7$ Sylow subgroups of $G$. THe cardinality of $S$ divides 32 and is congruent to 1 mod 7, so has to be 1 or 8. Let $H$ be a 2-Sylow subgroup of $G$. It has 32 elements and acts on $S$ by conjugation. This is my first question, how do we know that $H$ acts on $S$ by conjugation. My guess is that since $S$ is the set of $7$-sylow subgroups and the $7$ sylow subgroups are conjugate, then action by conjugation of an element $h \in H$, will just send one 7 Sylow subgroup to another one and so the conjugation of $S$ will just be $S$.

I was hoping someone could look over the logic of this answer for completeness and soundness of logic. I think I understand, ultimately, how to check this, but I worry that I'm 'reinventing the wheel' when there's a much easier, more intuitive approach. (In other words, I would never want to replicate something like this on a timed exam.) We have the set: $\{\text{id}, (12345), (13524), (14253), (15432)\}$. We need to check four properties: (a) Associativity: This is trivially the case, as it holds for all permutations and for the group, $S_5$, so it will surely hold for a subset of that group, regardless of whether those permutations form a subgroup. (b) Identity: The identity permutation is indeed included in this set. (c) Closure: I think the only way to check this is to take all possible compositions of the permutations in the group and ensure that they produce elements in the group. The identity, clearly, will produce any of the permutations we compose it with, and it commutes, so we can for the moment omit that from our verification process. Let's denote these permutations as:  \begin{align*} & (12345) = \sigma \\ & (13524) = \beta \\ & (14253) = \tau \\ & (15432) = \gamma \end{align*} I then can check each of these. Upon working these out on scrap paper (the easiest way would perhaps be with a group table), I get:  \begin{align*} & \tau \sigma = (15432) = \gamma \\ & \sigma \tau = (15432) = \gamma \\ & \gamma \sigma = \text{id} \\ & \sigma \gamma = \text{id} \\ & \beta \sigma = (14253) = \tau \\ & \sigma \beta = (14253) = \tau \\ & \tau \sigma = (15432) = \gamma \\ & \sigma \sigma = (13524) = \beta \\ & \beta \tau = \text{id} \\ & \tau \beta = \text{id} \\ & \gamma \tau = (15432) = \beta \\ & \tau \gamma = (13524) = \beta \\ & \tau \tau = (12345) = \sigma \\ & \beta \gamma = (12345) = \sigma \\ & \gamma \beta = (12345) = \sigma \\ & \beta \beta = (15432) = \gamma \\ & \gamma \gamma = (14253) = \tau \end{align*} So, we can see from this that the group is closed under composition of permutations. Inverses: The inverse of the identity is clearly the identity. The inverse of $\beta$ is $\tau$, and thus the identity of $\tau$ is $\beta$. The inverse of $\gamma$ is $\sigma$, and thus the inverse of $\sigma$ is $\gamma$. Thus, every element of this group has an inverse.

For each vertex $v\in\Gamma(G),$ there will be $n$ outgoing edges, labeled by the generators, and $n$ incoming edges: the edge labeled $g_i$ connects $v$ to $vg_i.$ It is convenient to make a slight modification of this picture when a generator $g_i$ has order $2.$  In that case, instead of drawing an arrow from $v$ to $vg_i$ and another arrow from $vg_i$ back to $v,$ we draw a single undirected edge labeled $g_i.$ So far, so good.  My problem comes when he extends this graph to a $2-$complex. Whenever $R$ is a relator for the group, that is, a word in the generators which represents $1$, then if you start from $v\in\Gamma(G)$ and trace out $R,$ you get back to $v$ again.  If $G$ has presentation $$ G=\langle g_1,g_2,\dots,g_n|R_1=1,R_2=1,\dots,R_k=1\rangle $$ the graph $\Gamma(G)$ extends to a $2-$complex $\Gamma^2(G)$: sew $k$ disks at each vertex of [sic] $v\in \Gamma(G),$ one for each relator $R_i$ so that its boundary traces out the word $R_i.$  An exception is made here for relations of the form $g_i^2=1$ since this relation is already incorporated in making $g_i$ an undirected edge. Thurston goes on to claim that $\Gamma^2(G)$ is simply connected.  Given a loop, the sequences of edges in the path is a word in the generators that represents the identity. He says, A proof that this word represents the identity by making substitutions using the relations $R_i$ can be translated geometrically into a homotopy of the path in $\Gamma^2(G).$ I don't understand at all how the $k$ disk are supposed to be sewn on, though Thurston seems to feel that this is obvious.  I'm thinking of the disk $R_i$ as a regular $m-$gon, where the are $m$ symbols in $R_i$ and the edges of the $m-$gon are labeled in sequence with the symbols of $R_i.$  Are these edges all supposed to be sewn to edges emanating from $v$?  That would seem to require self-intersection, at least in some cases, but later on, Thurston seems to imply that $\Gamma^2(G)$ is embedded in three-space.  (That may be a false impression.  I've only gone through the paper once quickly to determine that it interested me, and now I'm trying to understand it-- and I'm stuck on the first page!) I'm also wondering exactly what a $2-$complex is.  I'm thinking it's something like a simplicial complex of dimension $2$, but there you never get anything like self-intersection do you?
