Using the embedding $Y\hookrightarrow\beta Y$ we can regard $f(X)$ as a subset of $\beta Y$ and therefore take its closure $\overline{f(X)} \subset \beta Y$ . Under which conditions do we have $\overline{f(X)} = \beta X$ ? Let us regard $\beta X$ as the Gelfand space to $C_b(X)$ , i.e., for every element $x \in \beta X$ there is a net $(x_i) \subset X$ , such that we can regard $x$ as the multiplicative functional $\varphi \mapsto \lim_i \varphi(x_i)$ on $C_b(X)$ . Analogously with $\beta Y$ . Then it seems that there is a natural map $j: \beta X \to \beta Y$ by pulling back bounded continuous functions from $Y$ to $X$ via the map $f$ , i.e., $j(x)(\varphi) := x(f^\ast \varphi)$ , where $\varphi \in C_b(Y)$ and $x \in \beta X$ . If $(x_i) \subset X$ is a net with $x_i \to x$ in $\beta X$ , then we have $x(f^\ast \varphi) = \lim_i \varphi(f(x_i))$ .

43,Question about proof of Tychonoff-Alaoglu,Question about proof of Tychonoff-Alaoglu,,"I'd like to check that I understand the proof in full detail. Can you tell me if the following is correct? Thanks for your help. Claim: The closed unit ball $B_{\|\cdot\|_{op}}(0,1)$ in $X^\ast$ is compact in the weak$^\ast$ topology. Proof: Define $Y = \prod_{x \in X} B(0, \|x\|)$, the product of closed balls of radius $\|x\|$ in $\mathbb R$ (or $\mathbb C$). Then by Tychonoff's theorem, $Y$ is compact. Now define a map $\phi : B_{\|\cdot\|_{op}}(0,1) \to Y$ by $\ell \mapsto (\ell(x))_x$. Then the image $\mathrm{im} \phi$ are sequences with $x$-th entry $\|\ell(x)\| \leq \|x\|$. Hence if the things in the image are linear, then they are in the image of $\phi$. So everything outside the image, that is, lying in $Y \setminus \mathrm{im} \phi$ is non-linear. (That all of $Y$ are functionals, that is, maps $X \to \mathbb C$, is clear by definition). So we have established that the image $\phi (B_{\|\cdot\|_{op}}(0,1))$ is $B_{\|\cdot\|_{op}}(0,1)$ itself. Hence $\varphi$ is surjective. That it is injective is clear. We proceed by showing that it's a homeomorphism and finish the proof by showing that its image is closed: First, $\phi$ is a homeomorphism: We already know that $\phi$ is continuous, by definition (we put the weak$^\ast$ topology on its domain and $\phi$ is an evaluation map). Its inverse is also continuous: Let $y \in B_{\|\cdot\|_{op}}(0,1)$ be a point and $\prod_{x \in X} B(y(x),\varepsilon_x) = \prod_{x \in X} B(\ell(x),\varepsilon_x)$ an open set containing it. Then since we have the product topology, all but finitely many components are the entire space, that is, for all but finitely many $x$ we have $B(\ell(x),\varepsilon_x) = B(0, \|x\|)$. So that $\phi^{-1}$ of an open set like this is a finite intersection: $$ \phi^{-1}(\prod_{x \in X} B(\ell(x),\varepsilon_x)) = \bigcap_{i=1}^n \{ \ell^\prime \in B_{\|\cdot\|_{op}}(0,1) \mid |\ell (x) - \ell^\prime (x)| < \varepsilon_x \} \supset \bigcap_{i=1}^n \{ \ell^\prime \in B_{\|\cdot\|_{op}}(0,1) \mid |\ell (x) - \ell^\prime (x)| < \varepsilon \}$$ where $\varepsilon = \min(\varepsilon_x)$. So that $\phi^{-1}$ of an open set maps to a basic open set in $B_{\|\cdot\|_{op}}(0,1)$. To finish we need to show that $\phi (B_{\|\cdot\|_{op}}(0,1))$ is closed: We show instead that its complement is open. To this end, let $y \in Y \setminus \phi (B_{\|\cdot\|_{op}}(0,1))$. Then $y$ is a non-linear functional so that there exist scalars $a,b$ and $x_1, x_2 \in X$ such that $y(ax_1 + bx_2) \neq a y(x_1) + b y(x_2)$. Choose $\varepsilon$ such that $B(y(ax_1 + bx_2), \varepsilon) \cap (a B(y(x_1), \varepsilon) + b B(y(x_2), \varepsilon)) = \varnothing$. If $\pi_x: Y \to B(0, \|x\|)$ is the projection then $\pi_x$ is continuous and hence its inverse maps open sets to open sets so that it's enough to show that the intersection of the inverse images of the open balls lies entirely in the complement of the image of $\varphi$: Let $z \in \pi_{ax_1 + bx_2}^{-1}(B(y(ax_1 + bx_2), \varepsilon)) \cap (\pi_{ax_1}^{-1} aB(y(x_1), \varepsilon) \cap \pi_{ax_1}^{-1} bB(y(x_2), \varepsilon)$. Then $z(ax_1 + bx_2) \neq a z(x_1) + b z(x_2)$.","I'd like to check that I understand the proof in full detail. Can you tell me if the following is correct? Thanks for your help. Claim: The closed unit ball $B_{\|\cdot\|_{op}}(0,1)$ in $X^\ast$ is compact in the weak$^\ast$ topology. Proof: Define $Y = \prod_{x \in X} B(0, \|x\|)$, the product of closed balls of radius $\|x\|$ in $\mathbb R$ (or $\mathbb C$). Then by Tychonoff's theorem, $Y$ is compact. Now define a map $\phi : B_{\|\cdot\|_{op}}(0,1) \to Y$ by $\ell \mapsto (\ell(x))_x$. Then the image $\mathrm{im} \phi$ are sequences with $x$-th entry $\|\ell(x)\| \leq \|x\|$. Hence if the things in the image are linear, then they are in the image of $\phi$. So everything outside the image, that is, lying in $Y \setminus \mathrm{im} \phi$ is non-linear. (That all of $Y$ are functionals, that is, maps $X \to \mathbb C$, is clear by definition). So we have established that the image $\phi (B_{\|\cdot\|_{op}}(0,1))$ is $B_{\|\cdot\|_{op}}(0,1)$ itself. Hence $\varphi$ is surjective. That it is injective is clear. We proceed by showing that it's a homeomorphism and finish the proof by showing that its image is closed: First, $\phi$ is a homeomorphism: We already know that $\phi$ is continuous, by definition (we put the weak$^\ast$ topology on its domain and $\phi$ is an evaluation map). Its inverse is also continuous: Let $y \in B_{\|\cdot\|_{op}}(0,1)$ be a point and $\prod_{x \in X} B(y(x),\varepsilon_x) = \prod_{x \in X} B(\ell(x),\varepsilon_x)$ an open set containing it. Then since we have the product topology, all but finitely many components are the entire space, that is, for all but finitely many $x$ we have $B(\ell(x),\varepsilon_x) = B(0, \|x\|)$. So that $\phi^{-1}$ of an open set like this is a finite intersection: $$ \phi^{-1}(\prod_{x \in X} B(\ell(x),\varepsilon_x)) = \bigcap_{i=1}^n \{ \ell^\prime \in B_{\|\cdot\|_{op}}(0,1) \mid |\ell (x) - \ell^\prime (x)| < \varepsilon_x \} \supset \bigcap_{i=1}^n \{ \ell^\prime \in B_{\|\cdot\|_{op}}(0,1) \mid |\ell (x) - \ell^\prime (x)| < \varepsilon \}$$ where $\varepsilon = \min(\varepsilon_x)$. So that $\phi^{-1}$ of an open set maps to a basic open set in $B_{\|\cdot\|_{op}}(0,1)$. To finish we need to show that $\phi (B_{\|\cdot\|_{op}}(0,1))$ is closed: We show instead that its complement is open. To this end, let $y \in Y \setminus \phi (B_{\|\cdot\|_{op}}(0,1))$. Then $y$ is a non-linear functional so that there exist scalars $a,b$ and $x_1, x_2 \in X$ such that $y(ax_1 + bx_2) \neq a y(x_1) + b y(x_2)$. Choose $\varepsilon$ such that $B(y(ax_1 + bx_2), \varepsilon) \cap (a B(y(x_1), \varepsilon) + b B(y(x_2), \varepsilon)) = \varnothing$. If $\pi_x: Y \to B(0, \|x\|)$ is the projection then $\pi_x$ is continuous and hence its inverse maps open sets to open sets so that it's enough to show that the intersection of the inverse images of the open balls lies entirely in the complement of the image of $\varphi$: Let $z \in \pi_{ax_1 + bx_2}^{-1}(B(y(ax_1 + bx_2), \varepsilon)) \cap (\pi_{ax_1}^{-1} aB(y(x_1), \varepsilon) \cap \pi_{ax_1}^{-1} bB(y(x_2), \varepsilon)$.

On the other hand, if we increase the number of dimension in case of cubes or polyhedra (to be specific), the volume increases. Hence, the volume of an infinite dimensional hypercube is infinite. Now, in the context of topology, a sphere is homeomorphic to a cube or parallelepiped, in the case of infinite dimensions... where the volume of the sphere is infinite and the volume of the hypercube is infinite... Does that imply that an object of volume of the magnitude zero is homeomorphic (that it can be continuously transformed) to something which has the volume of the magnitude Infinity? Perhaps this is not a new problem to the topologists, or maybe it is not a problem at all to them... But it is confusing me.",,"['general-topology', 'measure-theory', 'lebesgue-measure']"
