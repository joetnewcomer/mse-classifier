0,Non-homogeneous Differential Equation,Non-homogeneous Differential Equation,,"Trying to solve a non-homogeneous differential equation, whether it is linear, Bernoulli, Euler, you solve the related homogeneous equation and then you look for a particular solution depending on the ""class"" of the non-homogeneous term. Just to make an example, let's say we have this equation $$y'' - y' - 2y = 2x e^x$$ we solve $$y'' -2y' +y =0$$ and we get solutions of the form $y_{\text{hom}}(x) = C_1 e^{2x} + C_2 e^{-x}$. Then, since the known term is of the form $p(x)(x) e^{\mu x}$, and $\mu$ is not a solution to the characteristic polynomial, we should find the solutions through those of the form $q(x)e^{\mu x}$. If, on the other hand, $\mu$ were a solution of the characteristic polynomial, we should have looked for solutions through those of the form $q(x) x^q e^{\mu x}$ where $q$ is the multiplicity of the root $\mu$. (where $q(x)$ is the general polynomial of the same degree as $p(x)$. I have a whole list of these ""classes"" of known terms, like $p(x)$, $p(x)e^{\mu x}$, $e^{\alpha x}(a \sin(\beta x) + a' \cos(\beta x))$, and the corresponding general solutions (like I said before, also with the multiplicity involved). My question is, where do these come from? I have no idea how such classes were found or anything; my book and my professors just said these were given and we should just learn them.

19,One problem about a barrier,One problem about a barrier,,"Suppose you have two points $A(0,0)$ and $B(L,0)$ on a plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $AB$ is a perpendicilar bisector of a straight barrier $\Omega=\{\ (x,y)\ |\ x=L/2,y\in [-\frac{a}{2},\frac{a}{2}] \}$ , also, $A$ and $B$ are standing on equal distances from $\Omega$ . So, let us call the middle point of $\Omega$ $O(L/2,0)$ , then $AO=BO=L/2$ . You want to move from $A$ to $B$ by the shortest line with constant velocity , but your moving point only has information about the barrier in an $\varepsilon$ -disc around itself. Thus, the trajectory of a moving point can be determined only in some neighbourhood of a moving point. For example, if $\varepsilon=\infty$ (it means that you can see the straight segment fully), you can move (without loss of generality due to the symmetry within the problem) from $A$ to the 'highest' point of $\Omega$ by a straight segment and then to $B$ in the same manner. In the case when $\varepsilon=L/2$ (it means that in the beginning of the motion we can see only the middle point of $\Omega$ ) the problem gets much more interesting! Our point will not be able to move by a straight segment to the peak of $\Omega$ as it will not have the full information about where the peak is. So there appears some curve from $A$ heading to the peak. The algorithm of finding the desirable path is as following: Move forfard, towards $\Omega$ , a bit, by a step $ds$ ; Find two points (one of which we can omit by the symmetry) of the intersection of the $\varepsilon$ -circle (to remind, $\varepsilon=L/2$ ); From one of the found points build a segment to the point $(ds,0)$ ; Move a bit, by $ds$ , in the direction of the segment built in (3); Repeat (1) to (4). This way seems to be extra-intuitive and informal. My question is: how to describe the path in terms of differential equations? I am attaching my considerations below, so feel free to check and fix them. Let us be searching the path in a parametric form $(x(t),y(t))$ . Firstly, $ds=\sqrt{\dot{x}^2+\dot{y}^2}dt$ . Secondly, by stepping by $ds$ towards $\Omega$ for the first time (at the zero iteration) our $\varepsilon$ -circle intersects the barrier in the points $$y=\sqrt{L^2-(L-ds)^2}.$$ Having these facts in the arsenal, we can conclude that at the first iteration we will be moving by the segment $(L-(L-(ds+dx_1))),y-dy_1)$ , where $dx_1$ and $dy_1$ stand for the translations in $x$ and $y$ after the zero iteration. After some algebraic transformations and saying that $dx_1=\dot{x},dy_1=\dot{y}$ I get the following equation: $$\dot{y}-\ddot{y}=\sqrt{2\ddot{x}\sqrt{\dot{x}^2+\dot{y}^2}(L-1)-2\dot{x}\ddot{x}}.$$ But one needs some other equation to make up a system of two equations determine the trajectory. By the way, at the moment $x_0=L-\sqrt{L^2-a^2/4}$ we will be moving to the peak by a straight segment as at this moment we will be able to see it.","Suppose you have two points and on a plane and is a perpendicilar bisector of a straight barrier , also, and are standing on equal distances from .

First of all, let's write down exactly what the theorem says in the case of a non-autonomous vector field. Theorem . Let $ E $ be a normed space ( $ \mathbb R^n $ will suffice). Let $ U\subset E $ be open. Let $ I\subset \mathbb R $ be an open interval. Let $ X\colon U\times I\to E $ be continuous and locally uniformly Lipschitz in the second variable. Let $ x_0\in U $ and $ t_0\in E $ . Then there exists an open ball $ B\subset U $ around $ x_0 $ , an open interval $ J = \left]t_0-\alpha,t_0+\alpha\right[\subset I $ around $ t_0 $ , and a unique integral curve $ x\colon J\to U $ of $ X $ such that $ x(t_0) = x_0 $ and such that $ x(t)\in B $ for every $ t\in J $ . A common ground Both the proofs I have in mind start by noticing that there exists an open ball $ B(x_0,\epsilon)\subset U $ and an open interval $ \left]t_0 - \delta,t_0 + \delta\right[\subset I $ where $ \lVert X(x,t) \rVert\leqq M $ for some $ M > 0 $ . This is kinda easy to prove. Moreover, let's call $ K_0 $ some local Lipschitz constant of $ X $ around $ (x_0,t_0) $ . The first proof Let $ \alpha $ be such that $ \alpha < \epsilon/M $ and $ \alpha < \delta $ . One way to prove the Theorem is to define inductively $ x_n\colon J = \left]t_0 - \alpha,t_0 + \alpha\right[\to U $ for every $ n\in \mathbb N $ by $$ x_0(t) = x_0\text{,}\qquad x_{n + 1}(t) = x_0 + \int_{t_0}^t X(x_n(\zeta),\zeta)\,\mathrm d\zeta\text{.} $$ By induction then $ x_n(t)\in B(x_0,\epsilon) $ and $$ \lVert x_n(t) - x_{n + 1}(t)\rVert\leqq \frac{MK^n}{(n + 1)!}\lvert t - t_0\rvert\text{,} $$ thus the $ x_n $ s form a uniformly Cauchy sequence that converges to an integral curve of $ X $ . The second proof The second proof I had in mind uses the celebrated Banach fixed point theorem, or rather one of its corollaries. We basically define the operator $$ T\colon H\to K\text{,}\qquad (Tx)(t) = x_0 + \int_{t_0}^t X(x(\zeta),\zeta)\,\mathrm d\zeta $$ where $ K $ is the space of bounded continuous functions $ x\colon J\to U $ equipped with the sup-norm $ \lVert\phantom{x}\rVert_\infty $ , and $ H $ is the open ball of radius $ \epsilon $ in $ K $ around the constant function $ \bar x_0 $ at $ x_0 $ . It is a general easy fact that if $ \lVert Tx - \bar x_0\rVert_\infty < (1 - C)\epsilon $ , where $ C $ is the contraction constant of $ T $ , then $ T $ has a fixed point that lies in $ H $ . A couple of questions The first one . The estimate to be made on $ \alpha $ in the second proof seems stronger. For the fixed point argument to work we need, in order: $ \alpha < \delta $ , $ \alpha < \epsilon/M $ (this ensures that $ Tx $ is again a bounded continuous mapping and thus lies in $ K $ ), and some other condition related to the fact that $ \lVert Tx - \bar x_0\rVert_\infty < (1 - C)\epsilon $ must hold. For example, Loomis&Sternberg's Advanced Calculus claims that $ \alpha $ should be smaller than $ \epsilon/(M + C\epsilon) $ . On the other hand, the first proof seems to work for all $ \alpha < \delta $ and $ \alpha < \epsilon/M $ . This surprises me. Did I do something wrong? The second one . This is more philosophic. I don't know anything about computational mathematics, but I was wondering: If one of these two iterative proofs were to be implemented on a computer, which one would it be? What's the differences between the two approaches. Or, on the contrary: How are they similar? I will follow a Dynamical Systems course next term and I hope it will clarify me some doubts, but for now I'm just leaving it there.","Lately I've been studying the existence [and uniqueness] theorem for ODEs.

Picard's Theorem, or the proof of it, should be useful for this. I tried to proceed as in the proof but there are several points where I got stuck.

(This is basically just the proof of Picard's Theorem.) The unique fixed point of $\mathcal{L}$ will be the solution of $x' = F(t,x)$ . I was also able to show that for $n$ large enough, $\beta_n \in Y$ . This means in particular that taking such $\beta_n$ and applying the Picard operator, I get something that converges to the solution uniformly, i.e., $$ \mathcal{L}^k(\beta_n) \to \beta $$ as $k \to \infty$ , where I denote by $\beta$ the unique solution of the ODE. However, this is not quite the convergence I want since I would like to have $\beta_n \to \beta$ . I don't see a way how to salvage this. I also tried to define a slightly different operator, namely $$ \mathcal{T}(\gamma)(t) = \gamma(t_0) + \int_{t_0}^t F(s, \gamma(s))\, ds, $$ which would seem to work nicer with the $\beta_n$ since $$ \mathcal{T}(\beta_n)(t) = \beta_n(t_0) + \int_{t_0}^t F(s, \beta_n(s))\, ds = x_{n-1} + \int_{t_0}^t F(s, \beta_n(s))\, ds, $$ however, this last expression is not quite $\beta_{n+1}(t)$ .

34,Solutions of $dx/dt = \lambda x$ with initial condition,Solutions of  with initial condition,dx/dt = \lambda x,"I'm working through Robinson's Introduction to Ordinary Differential Equations (Section 8.2) and have a few questions. The section is on finding the solution of the simplest possible linear differential equation, $$\frac{dx}{dt} = \lambda x$$ with the initial condition $$x(t_0) = x_0.$$ Here's the first issue I encountered. If $x_0 = 0$ , the author claims $x(t) = 0$ for all time. Could anyone provide a formal proof of this? I can see that $x(t_0) = x_0 = 0$ leads to $\dot{x}(t_0) = 0$ , but why would this imply $x(t) \equiv 0$ ? I can sort of see why this is visually by drawing a phase diagram like the one in figure 8.1: in the case $x_0 = 0$ , the line has zero slope and goes through 0 , so $x$ must be the constant zero solution. However, I'd really appreciate a more detailed explanation. If $x_0 \neq 0$ , he goes on to integrate the equation: $$\int_{x = x_0}^{x(t)} \frac{1}{x}dx = \int_{t=t_0}^t \tau d\tau$$ and arrives at $$ \frac{|x|}{|x_0| } = e^{\lambda(t-t_0)} \tag{$*$}$$ Next he writes: To work out what to do about the modulus signs, the easiest thing is to draw the phase diagram. For the case $\lambda > 0$ this is shown in Figure 8.1, from which we can see that $x(t)$ and $x_0$ have the same sign. It follows that we can remove the modulus signs and multiply up to give $$x = x_0 e^{\lambda(t-t_0)}$$ The figure is reproduced below: The way I understand this is: if $\lambda >0$ , then from the differential equation, $x$ and $\dot{x}$ always have the same sign. So if $x(t_0) = x_0 > 0$ , then $\forall t$ , $x(t) > 0 $ . However, if $x(t_0) = x_0 < 0$ , then $\dot{x}<0$ and hence we will have $x(t) < 0 $ for all $t$ . So $x(t)$ and $x_0$ have the same sign and we can simply remove the modulus signs. The case $\lambda < 0$ was left to the reader. Here is my reasoning: If $x_0 < 0$ , then $\dot{x}(t_0) > 0$ , so $x(t)$ is increasing (at least until $x(t) = 0 \iff \dot{x}(t) = 0 $ ). But from ( $*$ ), $x=0 \iff e^{\lambda(t-t_0)} = 0$ , which is not satisfied by any $t\in \mathbb{R}$ . So $x$ never reaches $0$ . Hence the solution must start negative, be increasing and tend to $0$ : $x = -|x_0| e^{\lambda(t-t_0)} = x_0 e^{\lambda(t-t_0)}$ If $x_0 > 0$ , then $\dot{x}(t_0) < 0$ , so $x(t)$ is decreasing (at least until $x(t) = 0 \iff \dot{x}(t) = 0 $ ). But once again we can't have $x=0$ for any $t$ , so the solutions starts positive, is decreasing and tends to $0$ : $x =  x_0 e^{\lambda(t-t_0)}$ So in every single case ( $\lambda > 0$ or $\lambda <0$ ) we obtain $$x = x_0 e^{\lambda(t-t_0)}$$ Is my reasoning correct?

I am thinking of $P(t)$ as expressing a bank account balance at time $t$ , to try to gain an intuition for Duhamel's Principle that doesn't depend on understanding physics. First I considered $P'(t) - \frac{1}{10}P(t) = \pi,\ P(0) = 0$ .  I started by solving $Q'(\tau) - \frac{1}{10}Q(\tau) = 0,\ Q(0) = \pi$ (swapping the forcing term and initial condition) and got the answer $Q(\tau) = \pi e^{\frac{1}{10}\tau}$ .  It appears that I can simply integrate this and produce the correct solution as $P(t) = \int_0^t \pi e^{\frac{1}{10}\tau} d\tau = 10\pi e^{\frac{1}{10}t} - 10\pi$ .  In English, this seems to say, ""To calculate the balance of a bank account starting with $\$0$ and continuously receiving deposits of $\$\pi$ per time unit, integrate between $0$ and $t$ the balance of a bank account starting with $\$\pi$ and continuously receiving deposits of $\$0$ per time unit.""  Of note is that both the real and hypothetical accounts have $10\%$ continuous compounding, but their time units are not necessarily the same ( $t$ and $\tau$ are presumably two forms of time). Since the above statement is not obvious, I decided to try a discrete version of the problem so I could then track the account balances at each time step.  To consider $P[n + 1] - \frac{1}{10}P[n] = \pi,\ P[0] = 0$ , I solved $Q[m + 1] - \frac{1}{10}Q[m] = 0,\ Q[0] = \pi$ .  The answer I got is $Q[m] = \frac{\pi}{10^m}$ , and inspired by the above integration, I took a summation from $0$ to $n$ to produce the solution $\displaystyle P[n] = \sum_{m = 0}^n \frac{\pi}{10^m} = \frac{\pi (10)^{n + 1} - \pi}{9(10)^n}$ .

Why not if false?,,"It is possible for a scalar finite-duration continuous system to achieve an infinite speed (in finite-time)? How if it true? Why not if it false? (Please read first the restrictions of the system I am interested in). Since new information has rise, now I am actually more interested in the ""Added Later"" part I have change the term ""time-limited"" for ""finite-duration"" since is more accurate and widely used, but it means that the scalar one-variable function $f(t)$ has an starting time $t_0$ for which $f(t) = 0\,\forall t<t_0$ , and also an ending time $t_F$ from which $f(t) = 0\,\forall t>t_F$ , with $t_0 < t_F$ To avoid some ""bad-behaved"" functions, I am thinking in functions $f(t)$ as a position of a classical object that change with time, with the function describing its position restricted as: $f(t)$ is continuous, including it been so in the following way: $\forall\,t_d,\,f(t_d^-) = f(t_d^+)$ so there is no ""jump-like discontinuities"" in the function $f(t)$ , so no ""teleportation"" is allowed. With this, I am avoiding the existence of delta functions components $\delta(t)$ in the derivative $f'(t)$ because of jump discontinuities (I don´t know if could have them because of other reasons). Also, I am thinking in well-behaved ""classic"" continuous functions, not things like a Brownian motion which is continuous and nowhere differentiable (I don´t know how to ""formally"" described this restriction - I hope you get the idea). The function $f(t)$ is of finite-duration, so compact-supported since is a one variable function (scalar). Since is continuous and compact-supported is also bounded, so $\sup\limits_t |f(t)| = \|f(t)\|_\infty < \infty$ . The function $f(t)$ has a well defined Fourier transform $F(w)$ (analytic, and follows the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma). Since for a compacted-supported function the Fourier transform could have some ""issues"" at the boundaries of it domain $\partial t = \{t_0,\,t_F\}$ , you could assume that $f(t_0)=f(t_F)=0$ if that makes it more easy to work with ( here I found a way to overcome this issues for arbitrary finite $\{f(t_0),\,f(t_F)\}$ so generality is sustained). The function $f(t)$ have finite energy $\int_{t_0}^{t_F} |f(t)|^2 dt < \infty$ , and is also Lebesgue integrable $\int_{t_0}^{t_F} |f(t)| dt < \infty$ (later I learned that if continuous and compacted supported, then is bounded, and this imply that the Fourier Transform is analytic, and then adding is Lebesgue Integrable implies then is of finite energy since is bounded, and I believe all this implies then the Riemann-Lebesgue follows, but not quite sure about the last affirmation) . I believe that if the function $f(t)$ have sharp-edges/tips/spikes like the absolute-value function at the origin, the first derivative (speed) $f'(t)$ will be discontinuous, but since $f(t)$ is bounded the ""jump"" in the derivative will be also bounded: as example, let $f(t) = \sin(|t|\pi),\,|t|\leq 1$ (plot here ), it have a sharp edge at $t=0$ so its derivative have a jump-discontinuity, but $\sup\limits_t |f'(t)| = \pi$ . At first glance, I thought that to have a spike with $\sup\limits_t |f'(t)| \to \infty$ at some time $t_d$ it has to have some $|f(t_d^-)| = |\lim\limits_{t \to t_d^-} f(t)| \to \infty$ and/or $|f(t_d^+)| = |\lim\limits_{t \to t_d^+} f(t)| \to \infty$ making the function $f(t)$ discontinuous, which is not allowed (as counterexample, $f(t) = 1/|t|$ has an ""infinite jump"" in $f'(t)$ ), but then I found the function $f(t) = \left|t \cdot \displaystyle{\frac{\log(t^2)}{2}}\right|,\,|t|\leq 1$ which have a sharp edge where an infinite speed is achieved with an infinite-size jump-discontinuity on $f'(t)$ without being $f(t)$ a discontinuous function (it also has bounded variation equal to $4/e$ even given it has a discontinuity on its derivative). Nevertheless, note that this functions can achieve these infinite speeds only at isolated/disjointed single points (of measure zero), or it will have a sudden position change with zero time, creating a jump-discontinuity in $f(t)$ which is not allowed from the assumptions (continuity part). With this in mind, the second derivative (acceleration) $f''(t)$ , must be allowed to have infinite jump discontinuities, or no abrupt changes of direction could be allowed, like crashing and bouncing from a wall, so the jump-discontinuity in $f'(t)$ will become a delta function $\delta(t) \equiv \infty$ in the acceleration profile (as example for $f(t) = \sin(|t|\pi),\,|t|\leq 1$ , its second derivative is $f''(t) = 2\pi\delta(t)-\pi^2 \sin(|t|\pi),\,|t|\leq 1$ ). So acceleration is necessarily unbounded. Also, speed must be allow to have discontinuities or no sudden changes in direction would be achieved - meaning this that smoothness is a too restrictive for this function, discarding Analytic solutions! . So, If I am right, an unbounded acceleration makes possible to achieve an infinite speed on a finite time, but it doesn´t mean that there are other laws making impossible to it to be unbounded - law which I am looking for. This behavior can be seen in the following examples: $f(t) = \sqrt{1-t^2},\,|t|\leq 1$ , which starts/ends with $|f'(t)| \to \infty$ as can be seen on its plot here . $f(t) = t \cdot \displaystyle{\frac{\log(t^2)}{2}},\,|t|\leq 1$ , which ""softly"" achieve $|f'(t)| \to \infty$ at $t=0$ as can be seen on its plot here . $f(t) = \left|t \cdot \displaystyle{\frac{\log(t^2)}{2}}\right|,\,|t|\leq 1$ , which achieve $|f'(t)| \to \infty$ at $t=0$ with an infinite-size jump-discontinuity in $f'(t)$ , as can be seen on its plot here . So the main question of the beginning can be divided as: It is possible for a real-life classic mechanical system to behave as the last examples? So achieving and infinite speed in a finite time? Here, I think that a model that can achieve an infinite speed, even if is only in one point in time, will violate every possible physics model with a finite speed for causality, but I haven´t found yet how causality conditions will restrict the derivative of these finite-duration functions. Can you think of examples of real life classic mechanic systems that behaves as the last examples? (I can´t made yet by myself an idea of an example). There are other ways of achieving an unbounded maximum rate of change for a classic mechanic system that are not included in the scenarios I mention?? (keeping the restrictions over $f(t)$ ). If is not possible, Which physics laws are avoiding it to happen? (here meaning that the maximum rate of change must be bounded because of these laws) . Here is where the problem of the bounds of the domain can make struggles in the Fourier Transform, since $\sup\limits_t |f'(t)| \leq \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^\infty |w F(w)|dw$ which can fictitiously diverge because of the effect of the discontinuities at the ""edges"" of the time-limited compact-support, but they can be avoided as is explained here by using instead $\sup\limits_t |f'(t)| \leq \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^\infty |iw F(w)+f(t_F)e^{-iwt_F}-f(t_0)e^{-iwt_0}|dw$ . If there are mistakes in my argumentation, please let me know what assumptions/lines-of-thought are wrong. Added Later I have found recently two papers from the author V. T. Haimo (1985), that analyze finite-duration differential equations [ 1 ] and [ 2 ]. From them, I realize I could be mixing two things into the question: first, math actually could stand any function cropped at some compact-domain to be treated as a finite-duration function, and second, that it is not really what I want to know, actually what I am looking for are for solutions to differential equations which are of finite-duration . On the papers the author explain that: ""One notices immediately that finite time differential equations cannot be Lipschitz at the origin. As all solutions reach zero in finite time, there is non-uniqueness of solutions through zero in backwards time. This, of course, violates the uniqueness condition for solutions of Lipschitz differential equations."" Since, linear differential equations have solutions that are unique, and finite-duration solutions aren´t, finite-duration phenomena models must be non-linear differential eqs. to show the required behavior (non meaning this, that every non-linear dynamic system support finite-duration solutions). Also, since the system ""dies"" at the end of the domain, the solutions will have the same issues than compacted-supported functions in this ending point, which will leads that finite-duration solutions cannot be Analytic in the whole time domain (maybe using functions defined piece-wise could work, like common bump-functions $\in C_c^\infty$ are defined, but no restricting the starting point to be also zero - which is a requirement for bump-functions for keeping smoothness). Note: discarding ""whole-domain analytic functions"" like Power Series, and also Linear ODEs, actually ""discards"" almost-all the maths knowledge I acquire on engineering, so this is totally new for me. The papers also show which conditions must fulfill the non-linear differential equation to support finite-duration solutions, at least for first and second order scalar ODEs. And in [1] on Theorem 2 point (i), it is said that, without losing generality by considering that the ending time of the finite-duration solution happens at $t_F = 0$ , for a second order dynamical system described by $\ddot{x}(t) = g(x(t),\dot{x}(t))$ such $g(0,0)=0$ (the system dynamics ""die"" at $t_F = 0$ ), with $g \in C^1(\mathbb{R}\setminus \{0\})$ , then for the system to support finite-duration solutions, the following another differential equation must have solutions: $$q(z)\frac{dq(z)}{dz} = g(z,q(z)),\,q(0)=0$$ Honestly the papers are bit advanced to my mathematical skills, but if I didn´t made any mistakes, what the author is doing is splitting the second derivative of the scalar one-variable function $x(t)$ as: $$\ddot{x} = \frac{d}{dt}\frac{dx(t)}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}\frac{dx}{dx}\frac{d\,x(t)}{dt} = \frac{dx}{dt}\frac{d}{dx}\frac{dx}{dt} = q(z)\frac{dq(z)}{dz}$$ by using the change of variable $z=x(t)$ and $q(z)=\dot{x}$ . I don´t really understand why this transformation leads to another differential equation that ""tells"" how the original equation will behave, so the following analysis is probably wrong, but I want to share it with you so you can correct me: Since I am looking from the maximum speed $\sup_t |\dot{x}|$ , and from the papers looks like I can figure out the behavior of $\dot{x}$ from $q(z)$ , I believe whatever it achieve a maximum, the values obtained should be the same, so finding $\sup_t |\dot{x}| \equiv \sup_z |q(z)|$ . With this, since $q(z)=0$ is not really a value I ""care"", I could use first order conditions to look for the maximum value of $q(z)$ , so I need to find $z$ such $$\frac{dq(z)}{dz}=0 \rightarrow z^* \rightarrow q(z^*)$$ So, since I am interested in $q(z) \neq 0$ , looking for the first order conditions is equivalent to looking for $q(z)\frac{dq(z)}{dz}=0$ , which is indeed the same that looking for $\ddot{x} = 0$ (if my assumption of interchangeability of equations is right - which I believe is not), so it would be meaning that finite-duration solutions of differential equations only can achieve their maximum speeds at inflection points of the acceleration profile where it is equal to zero $\ddot{x}=0$ , which instantly discard situations as the example $f(t) = t \cdot \displaystyle{\frac{\log(t^2)}{2}},\,|t|\leq 1$ , which ""softly"" achieve $|f'(t)| \to \infty$ at $t=0$ but at this points it second derivative is non-zero (actually diverges to infinity). This is quite an aggressive affirmation (so, probably wrong), since it can be reformulated as: finite-duration solutions to scalar-second-order differential equations, which are of unlimited bandwidth because of having finite-duration so they could achieve infinite speeds in principle, are actually restricted by being solutions of finite-time differential equations  (with $g(x, \dot{x}) \in C^1(\mathbb{R}\setminus \{0\})$ ) so they can achieve their maximum speeds only when it acceleration is zero discarding it of happening at discontinuities, so their maximum speeds are actually bounded .... this is actually too good to be true (maybe it happens because of the restriction on $g(x,\dot{x})$ ), but it is quite interesting to see which restrictions could rise for mechanical systems described by these finite-time differential equations, and I did not find too much information related to them so I think are quite unknown. So far I have only found nunerical representatuons of this finite-duration solutions, and maybe the mentioned paper is only reviewing the behavior near the ending point, but anyway, any example of a function that is a finite-duration solution of a differential equation will be preciated (I don't even know if a close-form is possible). Hope you can comment about.","It is possible for a scalar finite-duration continuous system to achieve an infinite speed (in finite-time)? How if it true? Why not if it false? (Please read first the restrictions of the system I am interested in). Since new information has rise, now I am actually more interested in the ""Added Later"" part I have change the term ""time-limited"" for ""finite-duration"" since is more accurate and widely used, but it means that the scalar one-variable function has an starting time for which , and also an ending time from which , with To avoid some ""bad-behaved"" functions, I am thinking in functions as a position of a classical object that change with time, with the function describing its position restricted as: is continuous, including it been so in the following way: so there is no ""jump-like discontinuities"" in the function , so no ""teleportation"" is allowed. With this, I am avoiding the existence of delta functions components in the derivative because of jump discontinuities (I don´t know if could have them because of other reasons). Also, I am thinking in well-behaved ""classic"" continuous functions, not things like a Brownian motion which is continuous and nowhere differentiable (I don´t know how to ""formally"" described this restriction - I hope you get the idea). The function is of finite-duration, so compact-supported since is a one variable function (scalar). Since is continuous and compact-supported is also bounded, so . The function has a well defined Fourier transform (analytic, and follows the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma). Since for a compacted-supported function the Fourier transform could have some ""issues"" at the boundaries of it domain , you could assume that if that makes it more easy to work with ( here I found a way to overcome this issues for arbitrary finite so generality is sustained).

Suppose that for every $\lambda$ the ODE admits uniqueness of solutions. My lecturer defined the parameterized flow of this equation as follows ( $(t_0, x_0, \lambda_0)\in D$ is fixed) : it is the function $\alpha:I_1 \times I_0 \times G_0 \times \Lambda_0\in \mathcal{N}(t_0, t_0, x_0, \lambda_0)\to \mathbb{R}^n$ defined as follows: for every $(\tau, \xi, \lambda)\in I_0\times G_0\times \Lambda_0$ the function $\alpha(., \tau, \xi, \lambda):I_1\to \mathbb{R}^n$ is the unique solution of the Cauchy problem with the initial condition $f(\tau)=\xi$ . He then went on to show that if $f$ is continuous and Lipschitz in the second variable then this $\alpha$ is a continuous function and he told us that this shows the continuous dependence of the ODE with respect to the initial conditions and the parameter. But here I am a bit puzzled. I knew that if there is no parameter then the continuous dependence with respect to the initial conditions for an equation of the form $\frac{dx}{dt}=f(t, x)$ is something like this: for every $\epsilon>0$ , there is some $\delta>0$ (which depends on $\epsilon$ and the point where I am given the initial condition) such that if $\phi$ and $\psi$ are two solutions of the ODE and $||\phi(t_0)-\psi(t_0)||\le \delta$ , then $||\phi(t)-\psi(t)||\le \epsilon$ for every $t$ for which these solutions are defined $(*)$ . Basically, if the initial values are sufficiently close, then the solutions will be arbitrarily close. However, even though intuitively I can see that these notions are the same, I can't see exactly how the fact that my flow $\alpha$ is continuous implies something like $(*)$ .

Please allow me to elaborate further. The differential equation $(1-x^2)y'' + y' + y = xe^x$ can be represented in the following power series form: $$\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}c_nn(n-1)x^{n-2} - \sum_{n=2}^{\infty}c_nn(n-1)x^{n}+ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}c_nnx^{n-1}+\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_nx^{n}  = x\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^n}{n!}$$ These terms will hereafter be referred to as terms 1, 2, 3, 4, and sum, respectively. My aim was to convert all powers of $x$ to the like power of $x^n$ , however I feel this may be the decision that resulted in issues further down the road. Note that the highest index of a $x^n$ term is found in term 2, therefore all other terms will be expanded to put their summations in a form with an index of 2. To convert term 1 to a like power of $x$ , the substitution $n = n+2$ was made. The series was then expanded to an index of 2.  The resulting series is as follows: $$\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}c_nn(n-1)x^{n-2} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_{n+2}(n+2)(n+1)x^{n} = 2c_2 + 6c_3x + \sum_{n=2}^{\infty}c_{n+2}(n+2)(n+1)x^{n}$$ Term 2 is already in the form of a like power of $x$ with a common index of 2. To convert term 3 to a like power of $x$ , the substitution $n = n+1$ was made. The series was then expanded to an index of 2. The resulting series is as follows: $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}c_nnx^{n-1} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_{n+1}(n+1)x^{n} =  c_1 + 2c_2x + \sum_{n=2}^{\infty}c_{n+1}(n+1)x^{n}$$ Term 4 is already in the form of a like power of $x$ , however does not share a common index. The series was expanded to an index of 2. The resulting series is as follows: $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_nx^{n} = c_0 + c_1x + \sum_{n=2}^{\infty}c_nx^{n}$$ The sum term is already in the form of a like power of $x$ , however it does not share the common index of 2. The series was expanded to an index of 2. The resulting series is as follows: $$x\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^n}{n!} = x + x^2 + x\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}\frac{x^n}{n!}$$ Combining all of these terms and like power series, the result is as follows: $$c_0 + c_1 + 2c_2 + x(c_1 + 2c_2 + 6c_3) + \sum_{n=2}^{\infty}(c_{n+2}(n+2)(n+1) + c_{n+1}(n+1) + c_n(2-n))x^{n} = x + x^2 + x\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}\frac{x^n}{n!}$$ This is where the issue is found. The $0$ th order constant terms can be equated to $0$ , and the $1$ st order constant terms can be equated to $1$ . However, there are no terms on the left hand side of the equation that will equal the $x^2$ term on the right hand side, unless the series is expanded, resulting in a loss of common indices between the two series. The series is also problematic, as the internal constant expression on the left hand side can be evaluated to $\frac{1}{n!}$ , but the series will never be equal due to the $x$ multiplier on the right hand side. In summary, I appear to be missing a power of $x$ on the left hand side of my equation. As stated earlier, I have an inclination that my choice to set the common power of $x$ to $x^n$ may have been a mistake. If the $x$ is factored into the series expression for $e^x$ , the power of $x$ would be $x^{n+1}$ , which could potentially resolve my issue if I restate my terms in the form of that power. However, I figured I would pass it by Stack Exchange and hopefully gain some insights as to what I am doing wrong here. Thank you for your time!

84,Tranformations of Curves,Tranformations of Curves,,"A while ago I asked a question similar to this, but looking back, I think I would have to further clarify. Please excuse how I ask this question, as I am very new to the Math Stack Exchange. Suppose I have a curve, with one endpoint on the origin of the x-y axis, and the other at some other point on the x-axis. In other words, the two endpoints of the curve are on (0,0) and some (x,0) If I were to change the position of the latter endpoint (x,0), how do other points on curve f(x) change with respect to the change of (x,0)? Intuitively, if I have a string, and I stretch an endpoint to some other position, how does the original string change? Moreover, if I were to move that endpoint in a specific path (represented as a function), what would the paths of the other points on the curve be? Looking at the problem, I thought about representing the function as a series of points, to which I would draw respective lines through each point, and would then calculate the motion of the other points with respect to the change of the latter endpoint. I did this for a 'one-point system', which is merely a point connected with 2 lines, with these lines connecting towards the two endpoints listed above (I would draw a diagram but I do not know how to on this software). Doing this, I found an equation, although it was huge. I then did this for two-point systems, and I soon realized that the solutions would be much bigger than I imagined. I am sure that if I continued to work on this problem, I would arrive at somewhat of a verdict. However, the people on this Stack Exchange are much more well-trained in mathematics than I am. And so my question is this: Does a solution currently exist to this problem? If so, what is it? If not, how would I further proceed with the method I used above? How would you all solve the problem? Please note that the new, transformed curve is subject to the previous curve's arc length (the original and new curve have the same length).

The author of the paper takes the proof to be obvious when dividing the given operator by the right factor and requiring that the division be exact, but I don't really see that for the second and the third case. What we want to do with the help of this lemma is decompose a differential operator $L$ in order to solve the corresponding differential equation $Ly=0$ , with y being the unknown function of x and A,B,C,a,b,c being rational functions of x. I understand that the operator product for differential operators is noncommutative and obeys the rule $Da=aD+a'. \qquad \qquad (5)$ So in order to proof the lemma's first statement, I do the following: Polynomial division (in D) of (1) by $D+a$ gives me $D+A-a$ , plus some rest $a^2-Aa+B$ . Ignoring the rest for the moment, I build and simplify the operator product, paying attention to the above rule (5): $(D+A-a)(D+a)= D^2+AD-aD+Da+Aa-a^2 = D^2+AD+a'+Aa-a^2 $ , and what follows is (2), if the division is to be exact. Now the same approach for proving the second statement. Polynomial division of (3) by $D+a$ gives $D^2+D(A-a)-Aa+a^2+B$ plus some rest. Again we build the product, multiply it out and try to simplify acording to (5): \begin{align} &(D^2+DA-Da-Aa+a^2+B)(D+a)  \\ &= D^3+DAD-DaD-AaD+a^2D+BD +D^2a+DAa-Da^2-Aa^2+a^3+Ba  \\ &= D^3+((AD+A')D)-(D(Da-a'))-(DAa-(Aa)')+(Da^2-(a^2)')+BD+ \cdots \\ &= D^3+ (AD^2+A'D)-(D^2a-Da')-(DAa-A'a-Aa')+(Da^2-2aa')+BD+ \cdots  \\ &= D^3+AD^2+BD+A'D+Da'+A'a+Aa'-2aa'-Aa^2+a^3+Ba. \end{align} But this does not bring me to (4).

94,Shifrin Differential Geometry Exercise $1.2.27$ -- A Differential Equation For Bikes,Shifrin Differential Geometry Exercise  -- A Differential Equation For Bikes,1.2.27,"The Question Suppose the front wheel of a bicycle follows the arclength-parametrized plane curve $\vec{\alpha}$ . Determine the path $\vec{\beta}$ of the rear wheel, $1$ unit away. As the hint explains, the goal is a differential equation involving $\theta$ , the angle of the front wheel with the axle of the bike, and $\kappa$ , the curvature of $\vec{\alpha}$ . This question is very interesting to me, and I haven't seen a solution written up anywhere. This is sort of shocking to me as it seems like it should be a very relevant problem for e.g. autonomous driving. What I've Tried I've only been able to make minimal progress. The hint tells us to write $\vec{\alpha} - \vec{\beta}$ in terms of $\theta$ , $\vec{T}$ (i.e. $\vec{\alpha}'$ ), and $\vec{N}$ (i.e. $\frac{\vec{\alpha}''}{\kappa}$ ). We obviously have $\| \vec{\alpha} - \vec{\beta}\|^2 = 1$ . Differentiating, we obtain $$ (\vec{\alpha}' - \vec{\beta}') \cdot (\vec{\alpha} - \vec{\beta}) = 0 $$ That is: $$ (\vec{T} - \vec{\beta}') \cdot (\vec{\alpha} - \vec{\beta}) = 0 $$ Differentiating again, we obtain $$ (\kappa \vec{N} - \vec{\beta}'') \cdot (\vec{\alpha} - \vec{\beta}) + (\vec{T} - \vec{\beta}') \cdot (\vec{T} - \vec{\beta}') = 0 $$ Now it seems to me we should have $$ \vec{T} \cdot \vec{\beta}' = \|\vec{\beta}'\| \cos \theta $$ So we can expand $$ (\vec{T} - \vec{\beta}') \cdot (\vec{T} - \vec{\beta}') = 1 - 2\|\beta'\| \cos\theta + \|\vec{\beta}'\|^2 $$ And that's as far as I've gotten. It seems like I'm going about this all wrong. In particular, I have no idea what to do with the derivatives of $\vec{\beta}$ . If only $\vec{\beta}$ were arclength parametrized I feel like I could make some progress, but I don't think there is any reason it should be. The only thing I can think is that we should have $$ \vec{\alpha} - \vec{\beta} = \lambda \vec{\beta}' $$ for some $\lambda$ that could depend on the arclength of $\vec{\alpha}$ . I didn't push too far in this direction, though, since it required introducing yet another unknown. I thought of yet another line of attack. Since $\|\vec{\alpha} - \vec{\beta}\| = 1$ , we can say that $\|\vec{\alpha} - \vec{\beta}\|$ is just $\vec{T}$ rotated by $\theta$ , i.e. $$ \vec{\alpha} - \vec{\beta} = \cos (\theta) \vec{T} + \sin(\theta) \vec{N} $$ With this expression I've gone as far as the hint suggests, but I don't see what to do next. What am I missing?

Let $\varepsilon>0$ be a small parameter.

What are its properties? In the discrete case it is known as divided differences, however here I am explicitly interested in this transform as a map $$T\colon A(D)\to A(D),\, f\mapsto R(f)$$ between the space of analytic functions $A(D)$ on an open interval $D\subset \mathbb R$ . Does the function we get by applying this transformation to the exponential function, i.e. $\frac{e^x-1}{x}$ have a name in the literature? The latter appears in the integrand of the exponential integral; is apparently related to the derivative of the exponential map from Lie groups and occurs in the solution of inhomogeneous linear ODEs, e.g. $\dot x = a x+b, x(t_0)=x_0$ has the solution $  x^*(t) = e^{a(t-t_0)}x_0 + \frac{e^{a(t-t_0)} -1}{a} b$ ; and in the multivariate case $\dot x(t) = A \cdot x(t) + b ,  x(t_0) = x_0$ we get the analogous $  x^*(t) = e^{A(t-t_0)}x_0 + \frac{e^{A(t-t_0)}-I}{A}b$ . Note that $\frac{e^{A(t-t_0)}-I}{A}$ exists even when $A$ is singular, hence it would be useful to drop this notation and give the function a name instead.","Given an analytic function / formal power series we can construct another analytical function via the ""divided difference"" transformation Note that this is similar but not equal to the derivative operator Does this transformation have a name in the literature?
