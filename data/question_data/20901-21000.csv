To solve this problem, I'm starting on the first non-trivial scenario: assume $c_1 z + c_2 f(z) + c_3 f(f(z)) = 0$ for some $c_1, c_2, c_3.$ If I can solve this, I'll probably know how to solve the general case. But I'm getting nowhere. The equations $z-f(z)-f(f(z))+f^3(z)=g(z)-g(g(z)) = 0$ for $f(z) = z+1, g(z) = |z|$ suggest we should impose analycity and non-linearity. Any hints or ideas?

Define a function to be $n$ -independent if $z, f(z), f(f(z)), \dots, f^{(n)}(z)$ are linearly independent over $\mathbb{C}$ on some non-empty open subset of $\mathbb{C}.$ Unproven Lemma: The set of $n$ -dependent functions forms a vector space under addition. $f$ being $n$ -dependent easily implies $cf$ is $n$ -dependent, so additivity is the only thing that stands in the way of proving this lemma. We need to figure out some way to handle terms like $(f+g) \circ (f+g) = f(f(z)+g(z))+g(f(z)+g(z))$ without messing up the rest of the terms. First note that $h(z)=az+b$ is $2$ -dependent since $z, h(z), h(h(z))$ are $3$ vectors in the $2$ dimensional vector space of polynomials with degree $\le 1.$ Suppose $f$ is analytic and non-linear. Let $n$ be minimal such that $f$ is $n$ -dependent. Let $g(z) = f(z)-(f(1)-f(0))z-f(0).$ Since $f$ isn't linear, $n \ge 2,$ implying $g$ is $n$ -dependepnt. Suppose $c_0 z + c_1 g(z) + \dots + c_n g^n(z) = 0.$ Setting $z=1,$ we get $c_0 = 0,$ so $c_1 z + \dots + c_n g^{n-1}(z) = 0$ on $\mathcal{O} = g(\mathbb{C}),$ which is open by the open mapping theorem since $g$ is analytic and non-constant. Thus, $g$ is $n-1$ dependent. If $n \ge 3,$ this means $f$ is $n-1$ dependent, contradiction. If $n=2,$ then $g$ is $1$ -dependent, so $g(z)=cz$ for some $c,$ which means $f$ is linear, contradiction.","I wish to prove that if is analytic and not of the form then are linearly independent functions over The cases are trivial.

Define a function to be -independent if are linearly independent over on some non-empty open subset of Unproven Lemma: The set of -dependent functions forms a vector space under addition. being -dependent easily implies is -dependent, so additivity is the only thing that stands in the way of proving this lemma.

First, by ""very small'', I mean that the Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff (CBH) series expansion is valid for both $\log(e^A e^B)$ and $\log(e^B e^A)$ . The CBH series expansion for $\log(e^X e^Y)$ is $e^X e^Y = \exp( \sum_{m=1}^{\infty} F_m(X, Y) )$ , where $F_m(X, Y)$ is a homogeneous polynomial of degree $m$ in the (generally, non-commuting) variables $X, Y$ (complex matrices of equal size, $n$ , say);  and $F_m(X, Y)$ contains neither the term $X^m$ nor the term $Y^m$ , except for $m=1$ : $F_1(X, Y) = X + Y$ .

Indeed, setting $X = e^A$ and $Y = e^B$ , so that $A = \log X$ and $B = \log Y$ , then $AB = BA$ because $\qquad A = (Xâˆ’I) âˆ’ \frac{1}{2}(Xâˆ’I)^2 + \frac{1}{3}(Xâˆ’I)^3 âˆ’ \cdots$ , $\qquad B = (Yâˆ’I) âˆ’ \frac{1}{2}(Yâˆ’I)^2 + \frac{1}{3}(Yâˆ’I)^3 âˆ’ \cdots$ , and the series commute since $X$ and $Y$ do. The assumed equality, $e^A e^B = e^{A+B}$ , implies that $\sum_{m=2}^{\infty} F_m(A, B) = 0$ ; but $A$ and $B$ are specific matrices, so we can't (immediately) conclude that each $F_m(A, B) = 0$ , for $m \geq 2$ .

13,Proof of the CS (cosine-sine) matrix decomposition,Proof of the CS (cosine-sine) matrix decomposition,,"The CS decomposition is a way to write the singular value decomposition of a matrix with orthonormal columns. More specifically, taking the notation from these notes (pdf alert), consider a $(n_1+n_2)\times p$ matrix $Q$ , with $$Q=\begin{bmatrix}Q_1 \\ Q_2\end{bmatrix},$$ where $Q_1$ has dimensions $n_1\times p$ and $Q_2$ has dimensions $n_2\times p$ . Assume $Q$ has orthonormal columns, that is, $Q_1^\dagger Q_1+Q_2^\dagger Q_2=I$ . Then the CS decomposition essentially tells us that the SVDs of $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are related. More specifically, there are unitaries $V, U_1, U_2$ such that \begin{aligned} U_1^\dagger Q_1 V=\operatorname{diag}(c_1,...,c_p), \\ U_2^\dagger Q_2 V=\operatorname{diag}(s_1,...,s_q), \end{aligned} with $c_i^2+s_i^2=1$ (from which the name of the decomposition comes). As far as I understand, this means that there is a set of orthonormal vectors $\{v_k\}_k$ such that both $\{Q_1 v_k\}_k$ and $\{Q_2 v_k\}$ are orthogonal sets of vectors (with some relations between their norms). To prove that this is the case, I start by writing down the SVDs of $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ , which tell us that there are unitaries $U_1, U_2, V_1, V_2$ , and diagonal positive matrices $D_1, D_2$ , such that \begin{aligned} Q_1= U_1 D_1 V_1^\dagger, \\ Q_2= U_2 D_2 V_2^\dagger. \end{aligned} The condition $Q_1^\dagger Q_1+Q_2^\dagger Q_2=I$ then translates into $$V_1 D_1^2 V_1^\dagger + V_2 D_2^2 V_2^\dagger=I.$$ Denoting with $v^{(i)}_k$ the $k$ -th column of $V_i$ , and $P^{(i)}_k\equiv v^{(i)}_k v^{(i)*}_k$ the associated projector, this condition can be seen to be equivalent to $$\sum_k (d^{(1)}_k)^2 P_k^{(1)}+\sum_k (d^{(2)}_k)^2 P_k^{(2)}=I,\tag A$$ where $d^{(i)}_k\equiv (D_i)_{kk}$ .

36,Construction of Free Vector Spaces,Construction of Free Vector Spaces,,"I've been studying the construction of Free Vector Spaces and I want to confirm if my conclusions are correct. Given a set $A$ we wish to construct a vector space $F(A)$ which intuitively is the vector space whose elements are linear combination of $A$ (in other words, we think of $F(A)$ as the vector space that has $A$ as it's base). Well, the problem here is that $A$ is just a set, without additional operations defined on it's elements. So what we do is to consider indicator functions $\delta_a : A \to \left\{0,1\right\}$ such that $\delta_a(x) = 1$ if $x = a$ and $\delta_a(x) = 0$ if not. Then we consider the set $F(A)$ of all functions with finite support on $A$. Well, this seems very natural: the indicator functions themselves are in $F(A)$ since they have finite support. In this case, $\delta_a\in F(A)$ is the ""representative"" of $a \in A$ at $F(A)$. Now, for those functions we can define their sum and multiplication by scalar in the natural pointwise fashion. Now, each $\delta_a$ represents some element of $A$ and the linear combinations of those functions represents the linear combinations of the elements of $A$ that we wanted to define. Since all functions with finite support can be expressed as linear combination of those indicator functions, and since they are linearly independent, we can say that they indeed form a base for the space. And then we can check that the set $F(A)$ with the operations defined really is a vector space. With all of this, given a set $A$ we've succesfully constructed a vector space $F(A)$ that intuitively has all linear combinations from the elements of $A$. And since $\delta_a$ represents the element $a \in A$ we usually forget the delta, and just write $a \in F(A)$. Is all of this correct ? My understanding of the construction is indeed correct ?

In the other direction I can't seem to make progress. I have been trying to think about it in two different ways. The first, consider the columns of the matrix. For it to be injective as a map between lattices, these columns need to be linearly independent, i.e. they satisfy no non trivial relation ($\sum r_iv_i =0$ implies $r_i = 0$). However, the key is that they don't satisfy an non trivial relation over the integers, but this may not be the case over the reals; there may be some non-zero real numbers $r'_i$ that cause $\sum r_iv_i =0$ and thus the map is not injective as a map between real spaces.

46,"A linear algebra ""game"" with binary matrices","A linear algebra ""game"" with binary matrices",,"Let $n\in\mathbb N$ and an arbitrary binary matrix $M\in\{0,1\}^{n\times n}$ of full rank be given such that the last row of $M$ equals $(1,1,\ldots,1)$ . The following problem arose from a research question I have been working on recently. The core mechanic of the ""game"" is about taking any two rows $m_j,m_k$ of $M$ and partitioning them into $\min\{m_j,m_k\},\max\{m_j,m_k\}$ where $\min,\max$ operate entrywise. Just as an example to make things clear, if $m_j=\begin{pmatrix}1&0&1&0  \end{pmatrix}$ and $m_k=\begin{pmatrix} 1&1&0&0 \end{pmatrix}$ then $$ \min\{m_j,m_k\}=\begin{pmatrix}1&0&0&0\end{pmatrix}\qquad \max\{m_j,m_k\}=\begin{pmatrix}  1&1&1&0\end{pmatrix} $$ and, obviously, $m_j+m_k=\min\{m_j,m_k\}+\max\{m_j,m_k\}$ .  Starting from $M_0:=M$ there are three possible scenarios: Neither $\min\{m_j,m_k\}$ nor $\max\{m_j,m_k\}$ are a row of $M_0$ . Then do nothing. Either $\min\{m_j,m_k\}$ or $\max\{m_j,m_k\}$ are a row of $M_0$ (but not both). Then extend $M$ by the other row vector. (Here we use the convention that the $0$ vector is a row of $M$ so if $\min\{m_j,m_k\}=0$ then extend $M_0$ by $\max\{m_j,m_k\}$ to get a new matrix $M_1$ .) Both $\min\{m_j,m_k\}$ and $\max\{m_j,m_k\}$ are a row of $M_0$ . Then do nothing. Repeat this process (where $M_0$ becomes $M_l$ and $M_1$ becomes $M_{l+1}$ in step $l\in\mathbb N_0$ ) until for every two rows of $M_l$ scenario 2 does not occur anymore, i.e. it is maximal in this sense and no other row is added via this scheme (then denoted by $M_\text{max}$ ). Now the ""game"" ends with a victory if there exist rows $m_{i_1},\ldots,m_{i_n}$ of $M_\text{max}$ such that $$ \begin{pmatrix}m_{i_1}\\\vdots\\m_{i_n}\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix} 1&0&\cdots&0\\ \vdots&\ddots&\ddots&\vdots\\ \vdots&&\ddots&0\\ 1&\cdots&\cdots&1 \end{pmatrix}\underline{\sigma}\tag{1} $$ for some permutation $\sigma\in S_n$ (where $\underline{\sigma}$ is the corresponding permutation matrix. This is equivalent to saying that $m_{i_{l+1}}$ arises from $m_{i_l}$ by turning a $0$ into a $1$ for all $l=1,\ldots,n-1$ . This concept should become a lot clearer again by considering an example. Example 1. Let $$ M=M_0=\begin{pmatrix} 1&0&0&0\\ 0&1&1&0\\ 1&0&1&1\\ 1&1&1&1 \end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}m_1\\m_2\\m_3\\m_4\end{pmatrix}\tag{2} $$ which is of full rank so we may start the game using this matrix. Now take for example $m_2$ and $m_3$ so $$ \min\{m_2,m_3\}=\begin{pmatrix} 0&0&1&0\end{pmatrix}\qquad\max\{m_2,m_3\}=\begin{pmatrix} 1&1&1&1\end{pmatrix}\,. $$ Because $\max\{m_2,m_3\}$ is a row of $M$ but $\min\{m_2,m_3\}$ is not, apply Step 2 to get $$ M_1=\begin{pmatrix} 1&0&0&0\\ 0&0&1&0\\ 0&1&1&0\\ 1&0&1&1\\ 1&1&1&1 \end{pmatrix} $$ Doing the same for $m_1$ and (now) $m_3$ yields $\max\{m_1,m_3\}=(1\ 1\ 1\ 0)$ and $\min\{m_1,m_3\}=(0\ 0\ 0\ 0)$ . By our convention this again is Scenario 2 so we extend $M_1$ by $(1\ 1\ 1\ 0)$ to get $$M_2=\begin{pmatrix} 1&0&0&0\\ 0&0&1&0\\ 0&1&1&0\\ 1&0&1&1\\ 1&1&1&0\\ 1&1&1&1 \end{pmatrix}$$ Once more for $m_4,m_5$ and we arrive at $$ M_3=\begin{pmatrix} 1&0&0&0\\ 0&0&1&0\\ 0&1&1&0\\ 1&0&1&0\\ 1&0&1&1\\ 1&1&1&0\\ 1&1&1&1 \end{pmatrix}=M_\text{max}\,. $$ One readily verifies that for any two rows of $M_3$ the above rule ends in Scenario 3 (so in particular not in Scenario 2, nothing new can be generated anymore) which shows maximality.    The submatrices of $M_\text{max}$ which satisfy the winning condition read $$ \begin{pmatrix} 1&0&0&0\\ 1&0&1&0\\ 1&0&1&1\\ 1&1&1&1	 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 1&0&0&0\\ 1&0&1&0\\ 1&1&1&0\\ 1&1&1&1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 0&0&1&0\\ 1&0&1&0\\ 1&0&1&1\\ 1&1&1&1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 0&0&1&0\\ 1&0&1&0\\ 1&1&1&0\\ 1&1&1&1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 0&0&1&0\\ 0&1&1&0\\ 1&1&1&0\\ 1&1&1&1 \end{pmatrix}\tag{3} $$ One can also reformulate the problem in terms of directed graphs, which may (or may not) be a good alternative approach here but it certainly visualizes this problem in a nice way. Turn row vectors $\{m_1,\ldots,m_l\}$ into vertices $\{v_1,\ldots,v_l\}$ and draw an arrow from $v_j$ to $v_k$ whenever $v_k-v_j$ is a standard basis vector (i.e. $v_k-v_j$ consists of $n-1$ zeros and one $1$ ). Again by convention, $(0\ \ldots\ 0)$ is turned into a vertex as well. The victory condition then is met if and only if there exists a path from $(0\ \ldots\ 0)$ to $(1\ \ldots\ 1)$ which is equivalent to $A_\text{max}^n\neq 0$ with $A_\text{max}$ the adjacency matrix of the graph corresponding to $M_\text{max}$ . Example 1 (directed graphs-version). The graph of the original $M$ from (2) is with adjacency matrix $$A_0=\begin{pmatrix} 0&1&0&0&0\\0&0&0&0&0\\0&0&0&0&0\\0&0&0&0&1\\0&0&0&0&0 \end{pmatrix}\,.$$ Then $M_1$ converts to with adjacency matrix $$A_1=\begin{pmatrix} 0&1&\color{blue}1&0&0&0\\0&0&\color{blue}0&0&0&0\\\color{blue}0&\color{blue}0&\color{blue}0&\color{blue}1&\color{blue}0&\color{blue}0\\0&0&\color{blue}0&0&0&0\\0&0&\color{blue}0&0&0&1 \\0&0&\color{blue}0&0&0&0\end{pmatrix}$$ followed by $$A_2=\begin{pmatrix} 0&1&1&0&0&\color{blue}0&0\\ 0&0&0&0&0&\color{blue}0&0\\ 0&0&0&1&0&\color{blue}0&0\\ 0&0&0&0&0&\color{blue}1&0\\ 0&0&0&0&0&\color{blue}0&1\\ \color{blue}0&\color{blue}0&\color{blue}0&\color{blue}0&\color{blue}0&\color{blue}0&\color{blue}1\\ 0&0&0&0&0&\color{blue}0&0 \end{pmatrix}$$ and $$ A_3=A_\text{max}=\begin{pmatrix}0&1&1&0&\color{blue}0&0&0&0\\ 0&0&0&0&\color{blue}1&0&0&0\\ 0&0&0&1&\color{blue}1&0&0&0\\ 0&0&0&0&\color{blue}0&0&1&0\\ \color{blue}0&\color{blue}0&\color{blue}0&\color{blue}0&\color{blue}0&\color{blue}1&\color{blue}1&\color{blue}0\\ 0&0&0&0&\color{blue}0&0&0&1\\ 0&0&0&0&\color{blue}0&0&0&1\\ 0&0&0&0&\color{blue}0&0&0&0  \end{pmatrix}\,.$$ The blue numbers are the ones that are added in the corresponding step.   Also note that the adjacency matrices of the individual steps are necessarily triangular.   Now the victory condition is met if and only if $A_\text{max}^4\neq 0$ . Indeed $A_\text{max}^4=5 e_1e_n^T$ so there exist 5 different paths (corresponding to eq.(3)) that lead from $(0\ \ldots\ 0)$ to $(1\ \ldots\ 1)$ . Be aware that $A_2^4=e_1e_n^T\neq 0$ becasue there is one path from $\vec 0$ to $\vec 1$ so we already won after the second step. The whole time I put the word ""game"" in quotation marks for the following reason: Conjecture 1. For every $M$ satisfying the above conditions the game ends in a victory, i.e. $M_\text{max}$ contains at least one submatrix of form (1). Equivalently the directed graph corresponding to $M_\text{max}$ contains at least one path leading from from $(0\ \ldots\ 0)$ to $(1\ \ldots\ 1)$ , i.e. $A_\text{max}^n\neq 0$ . A useful intermediate step might be the following: Conjecture 2. Let $M$ satisfying the above conditions be given. For any two rows $m_j,m_k$ of $M_\text{max}$ only scenario 3 can occur. These conjectures are supported by a plethora of examples I have computed (up to $n=6$ ) which makes me rather confident that this is true. Two short comments to make here. The full rank condition on $M$ cannot be waived or replaced by something like ""all rows of $M$ have to be pairwise distinct"". For this consider $$ M=\begin{pmatrix} 1&1&0\\0&1&1\\1&1&1 \end{pmatrix}=M_\text{max} $$ which does obviously not satisfy the winning condition (although for any two rows, Scenario 3 occurs). Having one row equal to $(1\ \ldots\ 1)$ is necessary. Consider $$ M=\begin{pmatrix} 1&1&0\\1&0&1\\0&1&1\end{pmatrix}=M_\text{max}\,, $$ cf. also mjacobse's answer. I am currently lacking ideas on how to approach this problem. Working with the adjacency matrices seems like a possibility, although I neither see how the rank of $M$ is reflected in $A_\text{max}$ nor do I see a general pattern there yet. The only thing I see is that if $M_1,M_2\in\{0,1\}^{n\times n}$ of full rank satisfy $M_1=M_2\underline{\tau}$ for some permutation $\tau\in S_n$ then $M_1$ leads to victory if and only if $M_2$ does---so we can reduce this problem to equivalence classes of initial matrices but this should at best be a simplification, not an idea for a proof.

56,How to generalize the determinant as function,How to generalize the determinant as function,,"Hi I was asked to show that for any vector space $V$ over a field $\mathbb{F}$ of arbitrary dimension $n$ that if we fix some basis $\beta=\{w_1,\ldots,w_n\}$ that there is a unique function $D_\beta : V \times \cdots \times V \to \mathbb{F}$ that will satisfy the three properties, $D_\beta(v_1,\ldots,v_n)=0$ if some $v_i=v_j, i \neq j$ $D_\beta$ is linear in each factor and $D_\beta(w_1,\ldots,w_n)=1$ Moreover, I want to be able to prove some things using this. For example that Applying D to some vectors v will be the same as taking the determinant of the coordinate representation of those v, that applying D and getting something non zero to a set of vectors implys those vectors are not a basis, etc. I know that in the case of two dimensional, we can do this by using the idea that the determinant gives the area of a parallelepiped, etc. And if we define the function to be that that satisfies the above properties then it can be easily shown to be unique. But in cases when it is not dim 2, since I dont have a general formula for the n vectors , how can this be done? Is it safe to assume that such a function exists and then just show it is unique, or must it be shown that even such a function exists at all? And say we could just define the function that satisfies those properties. Then how would we show it is unique, etc? Is it possible to maybe do this problem using matrices? Ie, we can define the determinant on the nxn matrices as our inputs, and somehow use that to prove things? I have not learned about things called alternating maps. I am still trying to do this , using advice in answers, is this how it should be approached? Define a mapping $f: L(V^{n}, \mathbb{F}) \to \mathbb{F}$ by $f \to f(e_1,...,e_n)$, or should it be as $f \to f(x_1,...x_n)$? Then $f$ is injective as if $f_{1}(e_1,...,e_n)=f_{2}(e_1,...,e_n)$ then would this imply they are equal as how a function acts on a basis completely determines it? I a just really confused. and then If I could show that it is subjective and thus an isomorphism I could say choose that unique f which is the one that gives $f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=0$ and claim this is the function $D_\beta$ I wanted. But I am having lots of trouble putting it all together. I still dont understand. It seems like the top answer is getting many vote, but I dont understand it. This is only a first course in linear algebra by the way, so I do not know about many advanced results. Maybe the answer could rely on sgn function and permutations.

Show there is a $K$ such that $S_K = S_{K+1} = \cdots$ Somewhere in the back of my brain there's an intuition that told me, ""Well duh , $K = \dim(T)$."" Obviously (to me anyway) once $K$ gets bigger than $\dim(T)$, you're either cycling around in some $T$-invariant subspace, or you're in the null space. My brain got there by envisioning a matrix in my head and thinking about what would happen to each vector in the domain until it was satisfied that $K=\dim(T)$ satisfies the prompt. At this point that part of my brain was content that a solution exists and moved on to something more interesting. But if I sit down and try to prove it with only the properties of transformations and subspaces, I don't even know where to start. Do I take a basis? Do I count dimensions? Nothing I try seems to get me anywhere. I think my brain is thinking about it the wrong way. Lower division math is about manipulating formulas and calculating. I got pretty good at doing that, and now my brain seems to attack every problem that way. I get the sense from talking to other (smarter) people that proofs are different. When my instructors come up with proofs they seem to be doing something completely different in their minds than I'm doing. To me it seems more akin to solving a puzzle than to manipulating equations. I don't see what they're doing that makes it so clear to them, in the way that lower division stuff is clear to me.

Show there is a $K$ such that $S_K = S_{K+1} = \cdots$ Somewhere in the back of my brain there's an intuition that told me, ""Well duh , $K = \dim(T)$."" Obviously (to me anyway) once $K$ gets bigger than $\dim(T)$, you're either cycling around in some $T$-invariant subspace, or you're in the null space. My brain got there by envisioning a matrix in my head and thinking about what would happen to each vector in the domain until it was satisfied that $K=\dim(T)$ satisfies the prompt. At this point that part of my brain was content that a solution exists and moved on to something more interesting. But if I sit down and try to prove it with only the properties of transformations and subspaces, I don't even know where to start. Do I take a basis? Do I count dimensions? Nothing I try seems to get me anywhere. I think my brain is thinking about it the wrong way. Lower division math is about manipulating formulas and calculating. I got pretty good at doing that, and now my brain seems to attack every problem that way. I get the sense from talking to other (smarter) people that proofs are different. When my instructors come up with proofs they seem to be doing something completely different in their minds than I'm doing. To me it seems more akin to solving a puzzle than to manipulating equations. I don't see what they're doing that makes it so clear to them, in the way that lower division stuff is clear to me.

74,Angle eigenvector makes with $x$-axis,Angle eigenvector makes with -axis,x,"Say I have a symmetric matrix that lives in $xy$ space. I will write it as $$A = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ b & c \end{pmatrix}.$$ I am interested in the covariance matrix, so let me also say $a,c>0$ , and $A$ is positive-definite, which means $|b|\leq\sqrt{ac}$ . The eigenvalues of $A$ are therefore $\geq 0$ , and the eigenvectors are orthogonal. The eigenvalue problem $A\mathbf{x}=\lambda\mathbf{x}$ reads $$\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ b & c \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \lambda \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}.$$ The system of equations can be written as \begin{cases} y = x(\lambda-a)/b \\  x = y(\lambda-c)/b, \end{cases} and combined to yield $$ \frac{c-a}{b}=\frac{y}{x}-\frac{x}{y}.$$ In the figure above, the red and blue vectors are the eigenvectors with the larger and smaller eigenvalue respectively. Working with the largest one, I can write the equation above the figure as \begin{align}     \frac{c-a}{b}  &= \tan{\theta}-\tan{\beta} \\                                 &= (1+\tan{\theta}\tan{\beta})\tan(\theta-\beta) \\                                 &= 2\tan(2\theta-\pi/2) \\                                 &=-2\cot(2\theta), \end{align} where to write the second equality I have used the trigonometric identity for the tangent of a difference. The third line follows from writing $\tan \theta \tan \beta = 1$ and $\beta = \pi/2 - \theta$ . Lastly, I used the trigonometric relations between complementary angles to write the last equality, which can be recasted as \begin{equation}     \tan(2\theta) = \frac{2b}{a -c}. \end{equation} The following equation $$\theta = \frac{1}{2}\textrm{atan2}(2b,a-c),$$ where $\textrm{atan2}(y,x)=\textrm{Arg}(x+iy)$ , can be used to compute the angle the eigenvector with largest eigenvalue, $\mathbf{x}$ , makes with the $x$ -direction. Choosing the principal branch, the range of $\theta$ is $(-90,90]^\circ$ , i.e. the right half of the plane. PROBLEM As you may have noticed, I absorbed the eigenvalue $\lambda$ in the equation right before the figure. This means the rest of the derivation should hold for both eigenvectors of $A$ . However, I have tested the calculation with multiple cases and magically the angle which $\theta$ measures is always that between the $x$ -direction and the eigenvector with largest eigenvalue. As an example, we can look at the special case $$A = \begin{pmatrix} a & 0 \\ 0 & c \end{pmatrix},$$ where the eigenvectors are aligned with the coordinate axes, and $a$ and $c$ are the eigenvalues. If $a>c$ , we get $\theta=0^\circ$ . However, if $a < c$ , we get $\theta = 90^\circ$ . Can anybody provide me with an explanation of why the ambiguity in the eigenvector that $\theta$ is describing seems to fade away somehow? I'd really appreciate it!

If I multiply $$\tan(2\theta) = \frac{2b}{a -c}$$ by $-1$ twice, getting $$ \tan(2\theta) = \frac{-2b}{c-a},$$ and I proceed as before and write $$\theta = \frac{1}{2}\textrm{atan2}(-2b,c-a),$$ now the angle is calculated between the $x$ -axis and the eigenvector with the smaller eigenvalue! In the wikipedia article on $\textrm{atan2}$ , specifically the section called "" East-counterclockwise, north-clockwise and south-clockwise conventions, etc. "", it says: Apparently, changing the sign of the x- and/or y-arguments and swapping their positions can create 8 possible variations of the $\mathrm{atan2}$ function and they, interestingly, correspond to 8 possible definitions of the angle, namely, clockwise or counterclockwise starting from each of the 4 cardinal directions, north, east, south and west. I think this brings me closer to the answer to my question but I need some help putting everything together. VISUAL AID Let me call the eigenvectors with larger and smaller eigenvalue $\mathbf{L}$ and $\mathbf{S}$ respectively. Let's look at how a few eigenvectors might look like in the $(a-c,b)$ plane. Consider the sketch that follows. The eigenvectors $\mathbf{L}$ and $\mathbf{S}$ are drawn in red and blue respectively, and the angle they make with the $x$ axis is called $\theta_l$ and $\theta_s$ respectively in the top subplot. As you can see, traversing the $(a-c,b)$ plane clockwise leads to the direction of the eigenvectors in the $xy$ plane rotating clockwise too. The arrow heads indicate the side of the vectors which falls in the range $(-90,90]^\circ$ . I have used Mathematica to produce the following surface plots of the angles in the $(a-c,b)$ plane. This is how the angle between the $x$ axis and $\mathbf{L}$ , given by $$\theta_l=\frac{1}{2}\textrm{atan2}(2b,a-c),$$ looks like: And this is how the angle the $x$ axis makes with $\mathbf{S}$ , $$\theta_s=\frac{1}{2}\textrm{atan2}(-2b,c-a),$$ looks like: If you check the surface values you can see they match what my sketch described. Let's come back to what was described in the wikipedia link. We can see $\textrm{atan2}(y,x)$ follows the "" East-anticlockwise "" convention. We have $\theta_l=0^\circ$ when $\mathbf{L}$ is pointing East, and the angle grows as $\mathbf{L}$ rotates anticlockwise. Now, if we try to make sense of the $\theta_s$ values as if they described $\mathbf{L}$ too, we can see $\theta_s=0^\circ$ when $\mathbf{L}$ is pointing North, and grows as $\mathbf{L}$ rotates anticlockwise. Hence, the $\textrm{atan2}(-y,-x)$ convention might be "" North-anticlockwise "". But again, I don't know what is special about $\mathbf{L}$ . From the derivation of the angles, either equation could have corresponded to either eigenvector. There is still a missing piece of the puzzle which I believe must lie in the derivation of the equation for $\theta_l$ . Can anybody give me a hand? Any insights would be greatly appreciated. SUMMARY The equation $$\tan(2\theta) = \frac{2b}{a -c}$$ holds for the azimuths of both eigenvectors, L and S , of the matrix $$A = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ b & c \end{pmatrix}.$$ Let me define 2 new vectors: $\mathbf{p}=(a-c,2b)$ , with azimuth $\gamma_p=\textrm{atan2}(p_y,p_x)$ . $\mathbf{n}=-\mathbf{p}$ , with azimuth $\gamma_n=\textrm{atan2}(-p_y,-p_x)$ . We can write $$\tan(2\theta) = \tan(\gamma_p) = \tan(\gamma_n).$$ It turns out using the first equality we get $$2\theta_l=\gamma_p=\textrm{atan2}(2b,a-c),$$ where $\theta_l$ is the angle between the $x$ axis and the eigenvector with larger eigenvalue, $\mathbf{L}$ . The second equality $$2\theta_s = \gamma_n = \textrm{atan2}(-2b,c-a)$$ gives us $\theta_s$ , the angle between the $x$ axis and the eigenvector with smaller eigenvalue, $\mathbf{S}$ . Now the question remaining is why does that happen? How could I have predicted that $\mathbf{p}$ and $\mathbf{n}$ would always have an azimuth that is twice that of $\mathbf{L}$ and $\mathbf{S}$ respectively? DIAGONALISATION I have found this derivation from Howard E. Haber from his Physics 116A class of Winter 2011. He obtains the same equation for $\tan(2\theta)$ by diagonalising the matrix $A$ (note the difference in notation: he uses $b$ in $A_{22}$ , and $c$ in the off-diagonal terms). He then proceeds by setting constraints in the angle $\theta$ . When he plugs his eq. 1 in his eq. 8 he makes it explicit that $\theta$ is measuring the angle between the positive $x$ axis and the eigenvector with largest eigenvalue. The conclusions drawn are the same as mine, but I somehow bypassed all that when I decided to use the function atan2 (unjustifiably, but it works).

77,5 points determine uniquely a conic,5 points determine uniquely a conic,,"I'm reading ""Multiple View Geometry"" by Richard Hartley and Andrew Zisserman. On pages 30-31 they have a section which proves that 5 points determine a conic. now, I know this question has been asked before but I would like an answer for the specific presentation which I describe below. First, they describe a conic by the equation: $$ax^2+bxy+cy^2+dx+ey+f=0$$ So by aggregating 5 points $(x_i,y_i)$ for $i\in\{1,\ldots,5\}$ which hold the above equation we get the matrix equation: $$\begin{bmatrix}x_1^2&x_1y_1&y_1^2&x_1&y_1&1\\x_2^2&x_2y_2&y_2^2&x_2&y_2&1\\x_3^2&x_3y_3&y_3^2&x_3&y_3&1\\x_4^2&x_4y_4&y_4^2&x_4&y_4&1\\x_5^2&x_5y_5&y_5^2&x_5&y_5&1\end{bmatrix}\mathbf{c}=0$$ where $\mathbf{c}=(a,b,c,d,e,f)^T$ . Finally, they claim the following: ""...the conic is the null vector of this $5\times$ 6 matrix . This shows that a conic is determined uniquely (up to scale) by five points in general position."" I have 2 questions about their derivation: 1) I know from other sources that 5 points where no 3 of them are collinear determine uniquely a conic so I guess that here the authors meant general linear position (which in this case translate to the condition that no 3 of the 5 points are collinear) and not some other kind of notion of general position. Am I right? 2) From a Linear algebraic point of view I would say that the immediate conclusion of the above matrix equation is that if the rank of such matrix is 5 then those 5 points determine uniquely a conic so I guess that this condition (of rank=5) can be translated to the condition for the 5 points to be in general position but I can't see why it is the same.","I'm reading ""Multiple View Geometry"" by Richard Hartley and Andrew Zisserman.

88,Counting the number of rank $r$ binary $n \times k$ matrices that has unique columns,Counting the number of rank  binary  matrices that has unique columns,r n \times k,"I'm trying to figure out how many ways there are to construct a $k \times n$ binary matrix such that it has rank $r$ and no column is repeating. I've tried a bunch of different approaches. The attempt that I assign the highest confidence is the following: We want to enumerate all possible $B_r = [\textbf{b}_1,\dots \textbf{b}_n]$ such that $\textbf{b}_i \in \mathbb{F}_2^k$, $\textbf{b}_i \neq \textbf{b}_j$ and Rank$(B_r) = r$. The number of ways to pick a basis of dimension $r$ from a subspace of dimension $k$ is given by the Gaussian binomial ${k \brack r}$. Since we have $n$ column slots and this basis will occupy $r$ of these slots, we can insert the basis in $\binom{n}{r}$ different ways. To fill the remaining $n-r$ columns, we must not choose a vector outside of the span of this basis, which means we must fill the remaining $n-r$ rows from a set of $2^r-r$ candidates. There are $2^r-r$ ways of choosing $\textbf{b}_{r+1}$ and $2^r-r-i$ ways of choosing $\textbf{b}_{r+i}$, where $i= 1,\dots,n-r$, so the number of possible rank $r$ matrices of dimension $k \times n$ with no repeating columns is given by $$|\{M \in \mathbb{F}_2^{n \times k}: \text{Rank}(M)=r, \textbf{m}_i \neq \textbf{m}_j\}| = \binom{n}{r}{k \brack r}\prod_{i=1}^{n-r} (2^r - r-i).$$ EDIT: After comparing joriki's expression with simulations in Matlab I just didn't get the right results. Let me try to reformulate my thought process as clearly as possible. Begin by considering the number of possible $r$-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{F}_2^k$, given by ${k \brack r}$. Enumerate all ways of building a $k \times n$ matrix only using elements from such a subspace, which is $\frac{2^r!}{(2^r-n)!}$. The problem is that all of these ${k \brack r}\frac{2^r!}{(2^r-n)!}$ matrices will not have rank $r$ (but none will have rank \emph{more} than $r$). To begin with, we must subtract all $k \times n$ rank $r-1$ submatrices. How many of these are there? Well the columns are eminating from a $r$-dimensional binary space. So we count the number of subspaces of dimension $r-1$ to an $r$-dimensional space and multiply with the number of ways of choosing $n$ vectors from this space. We get ${r \brack r-1}\frac{2^{r-1}!}{(2^{r-1}-n)!}$. But once again we have the problem that not all these have rank $r-1$. So from this we must subtract ${r-1 \brack r-2}\frac{2^{r-2}!}{(2^{r-2}-n)!}$ and so forth. \begin{align} |\mathcal{N}_{r,k}| = &{k \brack r}\frac{2^r!}{(2^r-n)!} - \sum_{i=1}^r \Big({r \brack r-i}\frac{2^{r-i}!}{(2^{r-i}-n)!} \\ &- \sum_{j=1}^{r-i}\Big({r-i \brack r-i-j}\frac{2^{r-i-j}!}{(2^{r-i-j}-n)!} - \sum_{\ell=1}^{r-i-j} \Big(\dots   \end{align} So how do we define this recursively? Define \begin{align} a_0 &:= {k \brack r}\frac{2^r!}{(2^r-n)!} \\ a_{p,q} &:= {p \brack q}\frac{2^q!}{(2^q-n)!} - \sum_{i=1}^p a_{q,q-i}. \end{align} Then we should have \begin{align} |\mathcal{N}_{r,k}| = a_0 - \sum_{i=1}^r a_{r,r-i}. \end{align} Tested this in Matlab and it does not work - it doesn't subtract enough matrices. The effect is greatest when $n,r < k$ and all parameters are not tiny. It is kind of weird how $k$ never enters into the enumeration of rank $r-i$ matrices of size $k\times n$. I guess it COULD make sense that the enumeration is conditionally independent on $k$ given that we know this new $r-i$ dimesional subspace is embedded in an $r<k$ dimensional space. But clearly undercounting is done somewhere in the recursion and this seems like the likeliest candidate. I guess the question is: Is counting the ways we can build a $k \times n$ matrix by only using elements from an $r-i$ dimensional subspace really the same as counting $r-i$ dimensional subspaces of $r<k$-dimensional space times the number of ways we can choose $n$ vectors out of this space? It does not seem right. EDIT 2: Back to where I started, essentially can't see the problem of the original attempt $$|\mathcal{N}_{r,k}| = {k \brack r}\frac{2^r!}{(2^r-n)!} - \sum_{i=1}^r |\mathcal{N}_{r-i,k}|.$$ Just count the number of $k \times n$ matrices with rank $r$ or less, then subtract all $k \times n$ matrices with rank less than $r$. This expression should essentially hold by definition. Really frustrating. EDIT 3: So the fault is ${k \brack r}\frac{2^r!}{(2^r-n)!}$ as a formula for counting all $k \times n$ matrices with rank at most $r$. It is overcounting by quite a bit. This is because the same matrix could be formed by choosing $n$ different components from two different subspaces. Consider subspaces $A = \{x_1,\dots, x_n, a_{n+1},\dots, a_{2^r}\}$ and $B = \{x_1,\dots,x_n, b_{n+1},\dots,b_{2^r}\}$. They're two distinct subspaces but we are counting the matrix formed from taking the first $n$ vectors from $A$ and the matrix formed from taking the first $n$ vectors from $B$ as two different matrices. Clearly they're not. Which makes one wonder if this can be solved with some kind of additional inclusion-exclusion trick, or if it's just one of those really tricky problems.","I'm trying to figure out how many ways there are to construct a $k \times n$ binary matrix such that it has rank $r$ and no column is repeating.

And here is what I got: Let $\{e_1, e_2, e_3\}$ form a basis for $V$. Then  $$\det(T-\lambda I)(e_1\wedge e_2\wedge e_3)=(Te_1-\lambda e_1)\wedge (Te_2-\lambda e_2)\wedge (Te_3- \lambda e_3)$$ whence expanding the RHS we get $$(\det T)(e_1\wedge e_2\wedge e_3) - \lambda(Te_2\wedge Te_2 \wedge e_3+ Te_1\wedge e_2\wedge Te_3 + e_1\wedge Te_2\wedge Te_3)+\lambda^2(Te_1\wedge e_2\wedge e_3+ e_1\wedge Te_2\wedge e_3+e_1\wedge e_2 \wedge Te_3) - \lambda^3(e_1\wedge e_2\wedge e_3)$$ Since $\det T=\text{trace}(\Lambda^3 T)$, the coefficient of $\lambda^0$ matches with that in the formula. Also, the coefficient of $\lambda^2$ is just $\text{trace}(T)$ by definition so this is also fine. The Problem. What I am not able to see is how the coefficient of $\lambda$ eaul to $\text{trace}(\Lambda^2T)$. Can somebody please help.
