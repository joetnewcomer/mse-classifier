1,Distance between $3\times3$ matrices (isometries),Distance between  matrices (isometries),3\times3,"The problem is pretty long, so I'm going to describe it while writting what I have so far.

Then define the distance between matrices (using the distance in $\Bbb R^9$), so we get $d: M_{3\times3}(\Bbb R) \times M_{3\times3}(\Bbb R) \to \Bbb R$ where $(A,B) \mapsto d_{\Bbb R^9}(\phi(A),\phi (B))$, where $d_{\Bbb R^9}$ is the usual metric of $\Bbb R^9$, clearly $d$ is a metric. Now, I have to prove that if we restrict the distance between the matrices to the elements of $O (3,\Bbb R)$,wich is the orthogonal group, for every $M \in SO(3,\Bbb R)$ exists $\varepsilon>0$ such that if $d(M,M')<\varepsilon$ then $M'$ is not a reflection.

2,Is there a name for this particular class of topological space?,Is there a name for this particular class of topological space?,,"This is a simple question, but I can't figure out the name for this class of topological space. Say you start with the affine space $\mathbb{R}^n$ for finite n, and equip it with a metric. Now, say you impose the equivalence relation generated by the relation such that for any two points $p, q$, $p \sim q \iff p-q \in V$, where V is a set of linearly independent vectors and $|V| \leq n$. This gives you a new topological space which can be thought of as a topological quotient space of the original (or also thought of as an orbit space). I will notate this space $\mathbb{R}^n/V$, and note that this new space also naturally inherits a metric from the old one via the quotient metric. Example: if you start with $\mathbb{R}^2$ and do this with $|V|$ = 1, you end up with the cylinder, and if you do it with $|V|$ = 2, you end up with the flat torus. Consider the set of all spaces one can obtain in this way; by starting with some finite-dimensional $\mathbb{R}^n$ and modding by some set of vectors $V$.

Construct a point E on DC (extended) such that AE intersects BC at F with EF = 1.

The shortest possible rope is wrapped once around the cone such that it starts at point A and ends at point B. Assume that the base diameter and the slant height of this cone are 6 cm and 12 cm, respectively. If AB = 3 cm and D is the point on the rope that is closest to C, what is the length, in cm, of CD? Instinctively, by just looking at the diagram, I believe that B is the point on the rope that is closest to C. Therefore D is the same as B, and CD = 12 - 3 = 9. However, this looks to simple to be true, and it doesn't make much sense to have two points overlap. Furthermore, I found this question from this website , where the 15th question of EMIC is exactly the question I was tasked with, and the solution claims that it is 7.2. The value of 7.2 makes no sense to me, so I tried to attempt the question again, by modelling the rope as a helix with parametric equation $$ x(t) = 3(1-t)\cos(8\pi t)\\ y(t) = 3(1-t)\sin(8\pi t)\\ z(t) = 3\sqrt{15}t\\ 0<t\leq\frac{1}{4}\\ $$ which, when plotted in desmos, seems to be exactly the rope I was given with in the question.

The result was that, for $t=t$ , the distance between the rope and the vertex is $$ 12|1-t| $$ Obviously, to minimise $12|1-t|$ for $0<t\leq\frac{1}{4}$ , $t=\frac{1}{4}$ when the distance becomes 9, validating my initial guess.

61,Show that $y=\frac{1}{x}$ is a hyperbola,Show that  is a hyperbola,y=\frac{1}{x},"I am trying to write $y=\frac{1}{x}$ in the standard form for a hyperbola, $\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1$ ( $a>0$ , $b>0$ ) but I can't figure out the last step. My book says to First, rotate the coordinate system through an angle $\theta$ . This means that the coordinates $x$ and $y$ should be replaced by, respectively, $x\cos\theta+y\sin\theta$ and $-x\sin\theta+y\cos\theta$ . Choosing an appropriate $\theta$ , we can make the coefficient of $xy$ equal to zero. With this modification was able to rewrite the equation as $$1=xy=(x\cos\theta+y\sin\theta)(-x\sin\theta+y\cos\theta)=-x^2(\sin\theta\cos\theta)+xy(\cos^2\theta-\sin^2\theta)+y^2(\sin\theta\cos\theta).$$ To get rid of the $xy$ term I set $\theta=\frac{\pi}{4}$ which simplified the equation to $$1=-\frac{x^2}{4}+\frac{y^2}{4}.$$ But the signs on my $x^2$ and $y^2$ terms are not what they should be with real $a,b$ . I assume this can be remedied in the next step, but I'm not sure how. Next we move the origin to $(x_0,y_0)$ , i.e., we replace $x$ by $x+x_0$ and $y$ by $y+y_0$ . By choosing an appropriate pair $(x_0,y_0)$ we can transform the equation into the canonical form.","I am trying to write in the standard form for a hyperbola, ( , ) but I can't figure out the last step.

Of particular interest in school is the three dimensional real vector space $(\mathbb{R}^3,+,\cdot)$ . This space is usually visualized by a three dimensional space and its elements, the vectors, are usually visualized by arrows pointing from the origin $0$ to its coordinates. Using the definition above, a vector, that is, an element of $\mathbb{R}^3$ is given by a $3$ -tuple $(x,y,z)$ where $x,y,z \in \mathbb{R}$ . However, a point is usually defined to be an element of $\mathbb{R}^3$ as well.

Question: $(1)$ Why is this distinction in the illustrations justified using the abstract definition provided above? I know that technically speaking $\mathbb{R}^3$ and $(\mathbb{R}^3,+,\cdot)$ are different objects, but elements of their respective sets are the same objects.

As an example one can regard the problem of calculating the distance between a ""point"" and a $2$ -dimensional subspace of $(\mathbb{R}^3,+,\cdot)$ . If one wanted to make a distinction between the two concepts mathematically, one could perhaps define vectors to be triples $(v,+,\cdot)$ where $v$ is an element of $V$ and $+,\cdot$ are the operations on $V$ . This would certainly give mathematically different concepts of points and vectors, but this is artificial to me.

98,Conditions on tetrahedron side lengths that guarantee existence of a sphere tangent to all its edges,Conditions on tetrahedron side lengths that guarantee existence of a sphere tangent to all its edges,,"I recently worked on the problem of finding a sphere tangent to the edges of an irregular tetrahedron.  I found that if one of the triangular faces of the tetrahedron is an isosceles triangle, then it is possible to find an infinite number of tetrahedrons that share this face, and each of them will have a unique sphere that is tangent to all its six edges. My question is , are there instances where a tetrahedron having all faces as scalene triangles can have such a tangent sphere to its edges ?","I recently worked on the problem of finding a sphere tangent to the edges of an irregular tetrahedron.

99,Gauss map on trace of curve,Gauss map on trace of curve,,"Suppose we have a curve $\gamma : I \to S$ where $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is an interval and $S$ is a surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$ (not necessarily orientable). We know that the Gauss map $N$ can be locally defined at all points of $S$ , but there is not necessarily a way to define it continuously on the whole surface. Can we define a map $N_I : I \to S^2$ such that $N_I(t)$ is normal to the surface $S$ at $\gamma(t)$ ? Notice that $N_I$ is not necessarily $N|_{\gamma(I)}$ , since for two points $t_0, t_1$ with $\gamma(t_0) = \gamma(t_1)$ it is possible that $N_I(t_0) \neq N_I(t_1)$ (indeed, this must happen necessarily if the manifold is non orientable).
