0,Approximating an infinite sum of only odd terms by a definite integral,Approximating an infinite sum of only odd terms by a definite integral,,"Consider the infinite Sum $S=\sum\limits_{n\ \text{odd}}^{\infty}\left(\dfrac{1}{nt}\right)^2\left[1-i\left(nt\right)^2\right]^{-1}$ Is there a way to approximate this sum as a contour integral? In my physical problem it is valid to make the approximation $t\to 0$ in a certain regime (or more precisely, the approximation that $t$ is very small). So I tried the following: Let us set aside the fact (for now) that this is a sum over odd terms only. So we rewrite the sum as $S=\dfrac{1}{t}\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}t\cdot\left(\dfrac{1}{nt}\right)^2\left[1-i\left(nt\right)^2\right]^{-1}$ $\ \ =\dfrac{1}{t}\lim\limits_{t\to 0}\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}t\cdot\left(\dfrac{1}{nt}\right)^2\left[1-i\left(nt\right)^2\right]^{-1}$ $\ \ =\dfrac{1}{t}\int\limits_0^\infty\dfrac{1}{x^2}\cdot\dfrac{1}{1-ix^2}\ dx$ (i.e.) setting $t\to dx$ and $nt\to x$ as this resembles a Riemann sum. But this doesn't work because the integral does not converge. Is there a nice way to approximate this infinite sum? Ideally, it'll be great if there is a way to do this without assuming $t$ is small. EDIT: Corrected the problem statement based on Blumenthal's comment.","Consider the infinite Sum $S=\sum\limits_{n\ \text{odd}}^{\infty}\left(\dfrac{1}{nt}\right)^2\left[1-i\left(nt\right)^2\right]^{-1}$ Is there a way to approximate this sum as a contour integral?

Then $f$ is holomorphic is equivalent to $f$ being analytic which in turn is also equivalent to satisfying the Cauchy-Riemann equations. All three concepts imply infinite differentiability. My question is what do we need to add to infinite differentiability to recover analyticity/ holomorphicity/Cauchy Riemann equations?,,['complex-analysis']

96,Method of Steepest Descent and Contour Deformation,Method of Steepest Descent and Contour Deformation,,"In the book An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory by Peskin and Schroeder, p. 14 in section 2.1, it is stated that, in looking at the asymptotic behavior for $x^{2} \gg t^{2}$ of the integral \begin{equation}     \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \mathrm{d}p \; p \, \mathrm{e}^{\phi(p)}, \qquad \phi(p) = i\left( p x - t \sqrt{p^{2} + m^{2}}\right),\tag{1} \end{equation} one can implement the method of stationary phase. However, the stationary points of $\phi(p)$ , $$p_{\pm} = \pm imx/\sqrt{x^{2} - t^{2}},\tag{2}$$ are imaginary, which would seem to indicate to me that the method of stationary phase is not applicable as is. The book then mentions that one can ""freely push the contour upward"", but exactly how and why is not clear to me. After looking around, it seems that the asymptotic behavior can be obtained by using the method of the steepest descent. However, I don't understand the following: How does one chooses a contour in the complex plane such that, through Cauchy's theorem I suppose, relates to the integral above, while at the same time passing through one of the stationary points. Should one choose only one of the stationary points? If yes, why? Any help is greatly appreciated.","In the book An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory by Peskin and Schroeder, p. 14 in section 2.1, it is stated that, in looking at the asymptotic behavior for of the integral one can implement the method of stationary phase.

97,Proof that $\zeta (z)=\frac{\sigma '(z)}{\sigma (z)}$,Proof that,\zeta (z)=\frac{\sigma '(z)}{\sigma (z)},"The Weierstrass $\sigma$ function of a lattice $\Omega$ is defined by $$\sigma (z)=z\prod_{\omega\in \Omega\setminus\{0\}}\left(1-\frac{z}{\omega}\right)\exp\left(\frac{z}{\omega}+\frac{1}{2}\frac{z^2}{\omega^2}\right).$$ The Weierstrass $\zeta$ function of a lattice $\Omega$ is defined by $$\zeta(z)=\frac{1}{z}+\sum_{\omega\in\Omega\setminus\{0\}}\left(\frac{1}{z-\omega}+\frac{1}{\omega}+\frac{z}{\omega^2}\right).$$ I want to prove that $$\zeta (z)=\frac{\sigma'(z)}{\sigma(z)}.$$ I've seen the following proof of the above theorem: $$\frac{d}{dz}\log\sigma (z)=\frac{d}{dz}\log z+\sum_{\omega\in\Omega\setminus\{0\}}\frac{d}{dz}\left(\log\left(1-\frac{z}{\omega}\right)+\frac{z}{\omega}+\frac{1}{2}\frac{z^2}{\omega^2}\right),$$ from which the identity follows. The complex logarithm is defined by $$\log z=\log |z|+i\operatorname{arg}z$$ where $\operatorname{arg}$ is the complex argument with the nonpositive real axis as a branch cut; $\operatorname{arg}z\in (-\pi,\pi]$ . Now I see $5$ problems with the above ""proof"": $\log$ is not differentiable everywhere because of the branch cut. $\log zw=\log z+\log w$ if $-\pi\lt \operatorname{arg}z+\operatorname{arg}w\le \pi$ ; the identity can fail outside this region. $\log zw=\log z+\log w$ does not imply $\log\prod=\sum\log$ where $\prod$ is an infinite product. $\log e^z=z$ for $z$ such that $-\pi\lt \operatorname{Im}z\le \pi$ ; the identity can fail outside this region. Interchanging the derivative and infinite series could be justified by uniform convergence, but how would one prove uniform convergence in this case? Can the above problems be patched? If so, how? Alternatively, can the theorem in question be proved without using logarithms? I thought that $$\mathrm{LHS}(z)=\mathrm{RHS}(z)+2\pi ik$$ and then differentiating could work, but then I realized that $k$ depends on $z$ and has jump discontinuities, so again we run into the problem of non-existent derivatives.","The Weierstrass function of a lattice is defined by The Weierstrass function of a lattice is defined by I want to prove that I've seen the following proof of the above theorem: from which the identity follows.
