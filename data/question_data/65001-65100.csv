1,Choosing diagonals in an $n$-gon,Choosing diagonals in an -gon,n,"Let $n>3$ be odd. Find the least value of $k$ such that in any convex $n$-gon, the sum of the lengths of $k$ arbitrarily chosen diagonals is at least as large as the sum of the lengths of the other unchosen diagonals. I have a bound $k\geq\left(\binom{n}{2}-n\right)-\tfrac{1}{2}(n-3)+1$. This is because we can take a ""water droplet"" shape, with $n-1$ points arranged along a semicircle, and the last point arbitrarily far away. Then effectively the only diagonals that matter are those $n-3$ diagonals joining our far away point to the others. Clearly, we need to take more than half of these $n-3$ diagonals, and this gives the claimed bound. However, I have no idea whether this bound is tight/can be improved.","Let $n>3$ be odd.

2,Are there partial orders (posets) of dimension $n$ with arbitrarily many linear extensions?,Are there partial orders (posets) of dimension  with arbitrarily many linear extensions?,n,"By dimension, I use the definition that was formulated by Dushnik and Miller: If $P$ is a partial order, then the dimension of $P$ is the minimum number of linear extensions of $P$ whose intersection is exactly $P$. A, not nessecarily minimum, set of linear extensions whose intersection is exactly $P$ is called a realizer . Intuitively, as the number of linear extensions increases, the number of possible realizers increases, possibly decreasing the dimension. EDIT: $n=1$: The answer is no. The only partial orders with dimension $1$ are already linear orders, so every dimension $1$ poset has only one linear extension. $n=2$: As mentioned by @CarlMummert, antichains of size $m$ have dimension $2$ and have $m!$ linear extensions, so there exist posets of dimension $2$ with arbitrarily many linear extensions.","By dimension, I use the definition that was formulated by Dushnik and Miller: If $P$ is a partial order, then the dimension of $P$ is the minimum number of linear extensions of $P$ whose intersection is exactly $P$.

4,Coin weighing to find similar-weight sets,Coin weighing to find similar-weight sets,,"There are $n$ coins. You have a scale that, between two sets of coins, tells you which set is heavier, or if they are equal. What is the worst-case minimum number of weighings after which you can divide the coins into three sets with the property that between any two sets $A,B$, there exists a coin in $B$ that if you remove it, then $A$ weights at least as much as $B$? This is possible using $O(n)$ weighings in the following way. Start with three empty sets. For each coin, put it into the set that is currently the lightest. After putting in each coin, use the scale twice to determine which set is now the lightest. We can check that the property is satisfied for any pair of set: If it is not satisfied for some pair $A,B$, then the last coin put in $B$ should have been put in $A$. I suspect finding an exact bound will be difficult, so an asymptotic bound is good enough. For example, can we do better than $O(n)$ weighings?","There are $n$ coins.

The integrations I used to get this result would be daunting for $k=2$ and prohibitive beyond that. Even for $k=1$ they seem out of proportion to the simplicity of the result. So I'm wondering whether there's a more elegant way to obtain this result, one that might also work for higher $k$ and might even allow the limit for $k\to\infty$ to be determined. Numerical results I produced with this code seem to indicate that the downward shift from the average occupancy $\frac n{2k+1}$ increases with $k$, but rather slowly. The numerical results for $k=2$ and $3$, i.e. $5$ and $7$ bins, are around $0.12$ and $0.13$, respectively (compared to $\frac1{2\pi\sqrt3}\approx0.092$ for $k=1$).

40,Chess Set Latin Square,Chess Set Latin Square,,"Here is a very interesting question that my professor and I came up with today. We came up with it while discussing another problem, and I'm very curious to see how this pans out! Question: Suppose that you have 32 chess sets and a 32 x 32 board. The chess sets are standard, consisting of 16 white pieces (8 pawns, 2 castles, 2 knights, 2 bishops, 1 queen and 1 king), and 16 black pieces (same as white) each. How many ways can you arrange the pieces on the board so that all of the rows and columns form chess sets? Thoughts: Clearly, the number of ways that you can arrange the pieces in the first row is $$\frac{32!}{(8!(2!)^3)^2}$$ The second row is also relatively easy, as the only restriction is that you cannot have two kings or queens of the same colour in the same column. After that it gets a bit tricky, because there is no guarantee that there are already two castles, knights or bishops in the same column. Obviously, as you work down the columns it becomes more probable that there are already the sufficient number of any given piece in the columns. However, the complexity that immediately arises from this method begs the question of whether or not multiplying out the number of arrangements for each row is the most efficient way of approaching this problem. I'm quite a beginner at combinatorics, and simply thought that it would be an interesting problem to give to this community, as well an opportunity to open my eyes to an area unfamiliar to me.","Here is a very interesting question that my professor and I came up with today.

It can be thought of as word of length $k$ in symbols in $[n]$ without duplications. An $(n,k)$ partial derangement is an $(n,k)$ partial permutation where the $i$ th symbol is not $i$ . A good $(n,k)$ partial permutation is a $(n,k)$ partial permutation that when $n+1$ is appended to the $k+1$ st position the resulting word never has $i+1$ directly following $i$ .  In other words if the we represent the extended partial permutation as a function $\sigma$ then for any $j$ , $\sigma(j)+1 \ne \sigma(j+1)$ . It is not hard to show by inclusion-exclusion that there are the same number of good partial permutations as there are partial derangements. Is there a simple bijection? Also, if the number of either is $d_{n,k}$ , then $d_{n,k}$ satisfies two recurrences. $$d_{n,k} = (n-1) d_{n-1,k-1} + (k-1)d_{n-2,k-2}$$ and $$(n-k) d_{n,k} = d_{n,k+1} + d_{n-1,k}$$ Do either of these have nice combinatorial descriptions for good partial permutations? To clarify: If we let $\text{pd}(n,k)$ be the partial derangements, and $\text{gpp}(n,k)$ the good partial permutations, then $$ \text{pd}(4,0)=\text{gpp}(4,0)=\emptyset$$ $$\text{pd}(4,1)=\{2,3,4\}$$ $$\text{gpp}(4,1)=\{1,2,3\}$$ $$\text{pd}(4,2)=\{21,23,24,31,34,41,43\}$$ $$\text{gpp}(4,2)=\{13,21,31,32,41,42,43\}$$ $$\text{pd}(4,3)=\{214,231,234,241,312,314,341,342,412,431,432\}$$ $$\text{gpp}(4,3)=\{132,142,143,213,241,243,321,413,421,431,432\}$$ Note that $312\notin \text{gpp}(4,3)$ as it contains 12 consecutively and $314\notin \text{gpp}(4,3)$ as if we append 5 to get 3145 we have 4 and 5 consecutively. Edit: Added the combinatorial explanations of the recurrences for partial derangements. To see that the first recurrence $$d_{n,k} = (n-1) d_{n-1,k-1} + (k-1)d_{n-2,k-2}$$ holds for partial derangements we describe a  bijection that takes an $(n,k)$ partial derangement $\sigma$ to a pair $(\hat\sigma,l)$ where $\hat\sigma$ is either an $(n-1,k-1)$ partial derangement and and $l$ is an integer in $[n]\setminus\{k\}$ or $\hat\sigma$ is an $(n-2,k-2)$ partial derangement and $l$ is an integer  an integer in $[k-1]$ . If the partial derangement does not contain $n$ then $\hat{\sigma}$ is $\sigma$ with the last element removed and $l$ is the last element.  If the partial permutation contains $n$ but not in the position indexed by the last element, then $\hat{\sigma}$ is $\sigma$ with the last element removed and $n$ replaced with the last element, and $l$ is the last element. Otherwise, $l$ is the last element, and $\sigma(l)=n$ , and we get $\hat{\sigma}$ by removing both $n$ and the last element and decrementing all values greater than $l$ by 1. For example, if $n=5$ and $k=3$ $$4312\Leftrightarrow (431,2)$$ $$4351\Leftrightarrow (431,1)$$ $$4512\Leftrightarrow (31,2)$$ It is not hard to see that all of these operations are reversible, and so the given operation is a bijection. To see that the second recurrence $$(n-k) d_{n,k} = d_{n,k+1} + d_{n-1,k}$$ holds for partial derangements, we describe a bijection that takes a pair consisting of an $(n,k)$ partial derangement $\sigma$ and an integer $l$ not occurring in $\sigma$ (there are $n-k$ possibilities for $l$ ) and constructs either an $(n,k+1)$ partial derangement, or an $(n-1,k)$ partial derangement $\hat\sigma$ . If $l \ne k+1$ then $\hat\sigma$ is obtained by appending $l$ to $\sigma$ giving a valid partial permutation.  Otherwise, let $\hat\sigma$ be the partial derangement obtained by subtracting 1 from all the elements of $\sigma$ greater than $k+1$ .  Again, it is not hard to see that this gives a bijection.  This seems like it should be an easy argument to transform to the same recurrence for good partial permutations, but I'm not seeing it.","This is a generalization of this question .

The first two times, we had 28 and 36 people play 7 rounds and I could not figure out a schedule that allowed for everyone to play with another play a maximum of one time. This time, we had 80 people play 8 rounds and I had no issue guaranteeing that everyone person was scheduled against others a maximum of one time. I'm considering altering the format for our next tournament and I want to know if there is a formula or algorithm that can be used to either: Determine the maximum number of rounds (r) that can be scheduled to guarantee each person is only scheduled to play with another person a maximum of one time throughout the tournament, given p number of participants. OR Determine the minimum number of participants (p) that are needed to guarantee that each will be scheduled against another participant a maximum of one time, given r number of rounds. The format of the tournament is: for each round, I schedule 4 people to a group. They play 3 games, one with each other group member as their partner. So, each participant plays against 3 other people in each round. Points are reported to me and the sum of points/wins is totaled to determine a ranking. There is no elimination. You can assume that the number of participants is a multiple of 4. The way that I've scheduled this, up to this point, is to put the names in a column in a spreadsheet and use a formula that based on the table number (t:1-20), seat number (s:1-4), a seed number for the round (r:1,4,5,7,9,11,13,17), and number of participants (p) that would pick a person from the list and put them into that seat. The basic formula is something along the lines of i = ((((t - 1) * 4) + (s - 1)) * r + 1) % p It also accounts for if p is divisible by r by adding 1 each loop through the list. I'm not sure if this is necessarily the most efficient way to schedule, but I doubt that it is. Before the first tournament, I tried writing a program to do the schedule via recursive backtracking and it did not come up with one. I assume that this is due to the limited number of participants. I'm not sure if this is a P vs. NP issue, but it seems like there could be some elegant solution as is the case with most other tournament formats.

Did I actually come up with something new, or am I just describing a known problem with my own terminology because I don't know any better ? The definitions as formally as I can, based on simple physical jigsaw puzzles with unique squiggly parts and uniform straight parts: puzzle : an $m \times n$ grid full of identically-sized, identically-oriented pieces piece : a square of $4$ edges; denoted $a_{i,j}$ for the piece in row $i$, column $j$ of puzzle $A$ where $1 \leq i \leq m$ and $1 \leq j \leq n$ edge : a means of joining two pieces; is either internal or external joined : two pieces sharing exactly one edge (either in the puzzle or a reconfiguration ) internal edge : a unique edge joining two pieces in the puzzle; denoted $\overline{a_{i,j}a_{g,h}}$ for joined pieces $a_{i,j}$ and $a_{g,h}$ the external edge : each of the identical $2m + 2n$ edges in the puzzle that are not internal a reconfiguration : the puzzle, modified by operating on individual pieces by means of right-angle rotations and piece-size translations, such that the end result is contiguous, i.e., any given piece is related to any other piece via a series of edges a valid reconfiguration : a reconfiguration wherein no two pieces are vertically or horizontally adjacent unless the edge they share is either the internal edge they share from the puzzle, or the external edge (i.e. an internal edge matches only as it does in the puzzle, and cannot match a different internal edge, nor the external edge) Informal clarifications Note that, necessarily, a valid reconfiguration is made by various joins of the external edge that were not part of the puzzle, and it will not be a neat rectangle in the end. That is to say, you can glue the straight parts together on the inside, you can't mismatch the squiggly parts, and some squiggly parts will now be on the outside. I actually thought of this question when considering such an arrangement of a normal physical puzzle for an artistic idea (maybe Picasso's cubism collides or colludes with Warhol?) so it is entirely made with real, physical puzzles in mind. Why this seems like a tricky combinatorial problem to me For $1 \times 1$, the puzzle cannot be reconfigured because no joins are possible because there is only one piece. For $1 \times 2$, there are $9$ valid reconfigurations, namely those made from the various combinations of matching any of the $3$ straight edges of $a_{1,1}$ with any of $3$ straight edges of $a_{1,2}$ (here pictured as A and B, respectively, because re-doing work in Excel wore me out): For $1 \times 3$, I count: $\overline{a_{1,1}a_{1,2}}$ intact, with one of $a_{1,3}$'s straight edges joined to one of $a_{1,2}$'s $= 3*2 = 6$ $\overline{a_{1,1}a_{1,2}}$ intact, with one of $a_{1,3}$'s straight edges joined to one of $a_{1,1}$'s $= 3*3 = 9$ $\overline{a_{1,2}a_{1,3}}$ intact, symmetrical with $a_{1,1}$ as in the above two cases $= 6 + 9 = 15$ $a_{1,1}$ joined to $a_{1,2}$ via a straight edge, and $a_{1,3}$ joined to $a_{1,2}$ via $a_{1,2}$'s other straight edge $= 3*2*3 = 18$ $a_{1,1}$ joined to $a_{1,3}$ via a straight edge, and $a_{1,2}$ joined to $a_{1,3}$ via another of $a_{1,3}$'s straight edges $= 3*3*2*2 = 36$ $a_{1,1}$ joined to $a_{1,3}$ via a straight edge, and $a_{1,2}$ joined to $a_{1,1}$ via another of $a_{1,1}$'s straight edges $= 3*3*2*2 = 36$ ...for a total of $120$ valid reconfigurations, if I didn't miss anything. For a $2 \times 2$, it certainly gets hairier: $\overline{a_{1,1}a_{1,2}}$ and $\overline{a_{1,1}a_{2,1}}$ intact, with $a_{2,2}$ removed and rejoined elsewhere $= 3*6 = 18$ symmetry of above with each of the other pieces functioning as $a_{2,2} = 3 * 18$ $\overline{a_{1,1}a_{1,2}}$ intact, and $a_{2,2}$ joined to $a_{1,2}$ by a straight edge: includes the case where the other joins are $\overline{a_{2,1}a_{2,2}}$, $a_{1,1}$'s top external edge with $a_{2,1}$'s bottom external edge, and $a_{1,2}$'s top external edge with $a_{2,2}$'s bottom external edge not as simple to calculate by straight multiplication, though: naturally cannot include invalid reconfigurations like where the other joins are $a_{1,1}$'s top external edge with $a_{2,1}$'s bottom external edge and $a_{2,2}$ rotated once clockwise so that its right edge joins $a_{1,2}$'s top edge, because $a_{2,2}$'s bottom edge, which is external, cannot join $a_{2,1}$'s right edge, which is the internal edge $\overline{a_{2,1}a_{2,2}}$...here it's already tricky ... total unknown For $1 \times 4$, there would, I would think, be more solutions than $2 \times 2$, since there are 10 external edges instead of 8, but it would also be tricky to calculate because of combinations of external edge joins that would need non-matching internal edges to join, which they can't. Holes for slightly larger puzzles Holes may arise in valid reconfigurations: The example above shows three different puzzles and a valid reconfiguration for each one that happens to have a hole.  (Straight edges are solid, and internal edges are dotted, even though different dotted edges may only join if they're joined in the original.  In a real puzzle these are the unique squiggly cuts resulting in two pieces sharing a pair squiggly parts that can only fit each other.)  The top $3 \times 4$ puzzle's reconfiguration has a hole with all internal edges, the middle $2 \times 4$ puzzle's reconfiguration has a hole with a mix of internal edges and straight edges, and the bottom $1 \times 8$ puzzle's reconfiguration has a hole with all straight edges. All of these are valid reconfigurations. Bounds A completely brute force approach to counting these may be taken by looking at all possible reconfigurations, then excluding the invalid ones (any where the graph is disconnected, or unmatching internal edges are adjacent.)  Then the question of rotational equivalence could be addressed, AFAICT simply by dividing by 4. The biggest area to check is $mn$ by $mn$, and each square in it can be occupied by one of the $mn$ original pieces in one of 4 rotations, or left blank.

72,On Applications of the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule,On Applications of the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule,,"The question is located below. In short, I am looking for an accessible explanation of the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule in relation to the following problem . Pardon the long setup. Let $Y$ be a standard Young tableau of shape $\lambda=(\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots,\lambda_n)$. At the risk of being pedantic, standard here means $\lambda_1\geq\lambda_2\geq\ldots\lambda_n$ and the entries are strictly increasing rightward along rows and downard along columns (with each number occuring only once). Let $f_\lambda$ denote the number of standard Young tableau of shape $\lambda$. It is well known that $f_\lambda$ can be calculated via the Hook formula: $$f_\lambda=\frac{|\lambda|!}{\prod_{i,j}h(i,j)}.$$ Now suppose I remove some boxes on the outer edge of the tableau (i'll call this a pattern from now on), giving a shape $\delta_i$ (I'll explain the $i$ in a moment). Here's an example: let $\lambda$ be the triangular tableau $(n-1,n-2,\ldots,1)$. Now I want to remove three adjacent boxes in an ""L"" shape: Here I've indexed the location of the left box as $i$ which gives the $x$ coordinate of the box ($i=3$ in this example). Again, I'm calling the new tableau of shape $\delta_i$, and one easily finds $f_{\delta_i}/f_\lambda$ as the ratio of the particular hooks that change. I'm interested in the following. In the above example, I removed three adjacent boxes at location $i$. I want to evaluate sums of the form: $$\sum_{i=1}^{n-2}\frac{f_{\delta_i}}{f_\lambda}$$. In full generality, I am interested in removing any pattern of boxes indexed by $i$ (the sum's range changes appropriately depending on the pattern). Going along with my example, one can show that $$f_{\delta_i}/f_\lambda=\frac{1}{3N(N-1)(N-2)}a_ia_{n-i-1},$$ where $N:=\binom{n}{2}$ and $a_i:=\frac{(2i+1)!!}{(2i-2)!!}$. One can then evaluate the sum using relatively straightforward generating functions for $a_i$, giving a tidy answer of $1/N$. Question: I have heard that calculating $\sum_{i=1}^{n-2}\frac{f_{\delta_i}}{f_\lambda}$ can be done via the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule. In particular, I've been told my $L$ example gives $-\frac{\chi^{\lambda}(\pi)}{\chi^\lambda(\mbox{id})}$ where $\pi$ is a 3-cycle. Can someone provide an accessible reference for this rule in the context above?

In short, I am looking for an accessible explanation of the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule.","The question is located below. In short, I am looking for an accessible explanation of the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule in relation to the following problem . Pardon the long setup. Let $Y$ be a standard Young tableau of shape $\lambda=(\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots,\lambda_n)$. At the risk of being pedantic, standard here means $\lambda_1\geq\lambda_2\geq\ldots\lambda_n$ and the entries are strictly increasing rightward along rows and downard along columns (with each number occuring only once). Let $f_\lambda$ denote the number of standard Young tableau of shape $\lambda$. It is well known that $f_\lambda$ can be calculated via the Hook formula: $$f_\lambda=\frac{|\lambda|!}{\prod_{i,j}h(i,j)}.$$ Now suppose I remove some boxes on the outer edge of the tableau (i'll call this a pattern from now on), giving a shape $\delta_i$ (I'll explain the $i$ in a moment). Here's an example: let $\lambda$ be the triangular tableau $(n-1,n-2,\ldots,1)$. Now I want to remove three adjacent boxes in an ""L"" shape: Here I've indexed the location of the left box as $i$ which gives the $x$ coordinate of the box ($i=3$ in this example). Again, I'm calling the new tableau of shape $\delta_i$, and one easily finds $f_{\delta_i}/f_\lambda$ as the ratio of the particular hooks that change. I'm interested in the following. In the above example, I removed three adjacent boxes at location $i$. I want to evaluate sums of the form: $$\sum_{i=1}^{n-2}\frac{f_{\delta_i}}{f_\lambda}$$. In full generality, I am interested in removing any pattern of boxes indexed by $i$ (the sum's range changes appropriately depending on the pattern). Going along with my example, one can show that $$f_{\delta_i}/f_\lambda=\frac{1}{3N(N-1)(N-2)}a_ia_{n-i-1},$$ where $N:=\binom{n}{2}$ and $a_i:=\frac{(2i+1)!!}{(2i-2)!!}$. One can then evaluate the sum using relatively straightforward generating functions for $a_i$, giving a tidy answer of $1/N$.
