What is the Expected Number of die rolls until obtaining the 1st successful roll? What is the Expected Number of desired sides seen at least once in $n$ rolls?

My Solutions to the Questions: Using a Geometric Distribution approach we have that the expected waiting time until the 1st success is $$E[x] = 1/p$$ where $$p = \sum_{i\in S} p_i$$ therefor $$p = 1/12 + 1/6 + 1/4 = 1/2$$ and $$E[x] = 1/(1/2) = 2$$ I believe this solution can be obtained from the the inclusion-exclusion principle: $$E[x] = \sum_{i\in S} 1-(1-p_i)^n$$ thus for $$n = 2$$ $$E[x] = 1-(1-1/12)^2 + 1-(1-1/6)^2 + 1-(1-1/4)^2 \approx 0.902777778$$ This answer comes from Ross; Introduction to Probability Models as the solution to the Unequal Coupon Collector Problem: $$\int_0^\infty1-(1-e^\frac{-x}{12})(1-e^\frac{-x}{6})(1-e^\frac{-x}{4})dx = 14.6$$ My ""Paradox"": I am not 100% confident in the solution to question 2.

But also, if the random variables $X_i$ belong to the same symmetrical distribution , then I will have that $\nu = \mu = m$ with "" $\mu[x]$ "" the mean value and ""m[x]"" the Median of the distribution ( $m$ is the value such it split the probabilities as $P(X\geq m) = P(X\leq m) = \frac12$ ). Since the mean value is a linear operator $\mu\left[\sum_i^N a_iX_i\right]=\sum_i^N a_i\mu[X_i]$ , under this ""symmetric"" scenario I think it should be true also that $\nu\left[\sum_i^N a_iX_i\right]=\sum_i^N a_i\nu[X_i]$ and $m\left[\sum_i^N a_iX_i\right]=\sum_i^N a_im[X_i]$ (this because $\mu$ , $\nu$ , and $m$ are homogeneous of degree $1$ ), so at least there are some conditions where they could be split as a weighted sum. Question__________________ If the variables $X_i$ belongs each to some non-necessarily identical Log-Normal distributions with some parameters $X_i \sim \text{Lognormal}(\mu_i,\ \sigma_i)$ (so each of them have their individual parameters $\nu[X_i]=\nu_i$ and $m[X_i]=m_i$ ), and for some real-valued weights $0\leq a_i\leq 1$ such as $\sum\limits_{i=1}^N a_i = 1$ , I want to know How far are from behaving as a linear function each of: $$\nu\left[\sum_{i=1}^N a_i X_i\right] \overset{?}{\approx}\sum_{i=1}^N a_i\ \nu\left[X_i\right]=\sum_{i=1}^N a_i\ \nu_i$$ $$m\left[\sum_{i=1}^N a_i X_i\right] \overset{?}{\approx}\sum_{i=1}^N a_i\ m\left[X_i\right]=\sum_{i=1}^N a_i\ m_i$$ Could we say something about the Left-Hand Sides (LHS) being always bigger/lower than the Right-Hand Sides (RHS)? Are there any inequalities setting bounds of how much spread could have the LHS from the RHS? Are there any ways of split somehow the LHS expressions? Like having a known formula?

PS: If you are currently a undergraduate student, I will really appreciate if you could share this question with your probability/statistic teachers. Added later After the answer by @Amir I realized that without without assuming anything regarding independence, correlations, or unimodality, one could do the following: $$\begin{array}{r c l} |\sum a_i m[x_i]-m\left[\sum a_i x_i\right]| & = & |\sum a_i m[x_i]+E\left[\sum a_i x_i\right]-E\left[\sum a_i x_i\right]-m\left[\sum a_i x_i\right]| \\ & \overset{\text{triangle ineq.}}{\leq} & |E\left[\sum a_i x_i\right]-m\left[\sum a_i x_i\right]|+|\sum a_i m[x_i]-E\left[\sum a_i x_i\right]| \\ & \overset{|\mu - m|\leq \sigma}{\leq} & \sqrt{\text{Var}\left[\sum a_i x_i\right]}+\left|\sum a_i\left(m[x_i]-E[x_i]\right)\right| \end{array}$$ due the linearity of the expected value. All the values from the RHS could be taken from the individual variable distributions. From this last result could be inferred conditions for having both terms near one from each other, and also tells that the mistaken formula from this another question could be useful at last as a selection figure since it will be penalizing strongly those variables which makes both $\sum a_i m[x_i]$ and $m\left[\sum a_i x_i\right]$ drift apart (note it was done from the mode, but identical construction could be made for the median).

One special hero has a special skill, i.e. when he is almost dying (life point goes from 1 to 0 due to the attack) he could draw a card from the deck and collect it, if the card has a same face value compared to the cards he collected by this method (i.e. draw a card when life point goes from 1 to 0) then he dies. I am just wondering on average how many cards he could collect (or how many times you need to ""attack"" him).",E(\sum_{i=1}^{52}I_i) I_i E(\sum_{i=1}^{52}I_i) = \sum_{i=1}^{52}P_i P_i P_i i,"['probability', 'statistics', 'card-games']"

9,Showing Sum of Normal Random Variables More than Additive,Showing Sum of Normal Random Variables More than Additive,,"Hopefully this is a quick question. I am not a statistician, so I would like to just make sure that I am approaching this problem correctly. I have some data that I am working with which is meant to monitor cell death and I am trying to compare the effects of different treatments on the cells. Since the research is proprietary, I cannot give the full details here, but I will give an example. I am monitoring cell death in response to stimuli. My control group contains 39 samples and is normally distributed with a mean death percentage of 0.05 and a variance $\sigma^2$ of 0.001. My first sample of size 37 is given treatment X has an approximately normal distribution with a mean death percentage of 0.1 and a variance $\sigma^2$ of 0.04. Likewise, the 43 cells given treatment Y have a death percentage of 0.18 and variance of 0.09. Lastly, the sample containing treatments X and Y with size 34 has a mean death percentage of 0.54 with a variance of 0.16. My question is then how do I show that the effect of treatments X and Y together is more than what would be expected from adding the random variables? Since I do not know that the variables are guaranteed to be independent (in fact, their effects seem to be very much not independent), my idea was to use the formulas $$E[X + Y] = E[X] + E[Y]$$ and $$Var[X + Y] = Var[X] + Var[Y] + 2Cov[X,Y]$$ to obtain the normal distribution for the sum of the random variables where I believe that the covariance of samples would be computed via $$Cov[X,Y] = \frac{\left(\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{N_x}(x_i - \mu_x)\right) \left(\sum\limits_{j=1}^{N_y}(y_j - \mu_y)\right)}{(N_x - 1)(N_y - 1)}$$ where the loss of 1 in each of the terms in the denominator comes from the loss of 1 d.o.f. from using each of the means (I am not sure if this is the correct formula as I could not find a reference for two different random variables, but it would make sense to me given the situation). Then, my idea was to construct two 95% confidence intervals -- one for my sample and one for the computed $X + Y$ random variable, and, provided that the confidence intervals did not overlap, I believe that I can reject the assumption that the effect of the two random variables is additive.

Urn C contains two balls, where the content is equidistributed over the number of red balls.

Fortunately, I know both the mean and variance of every element in A with pretty high precision. In addition, x is entirely non-random. Under these conditions, the problem slightly changes. I now want to find the optimal solution of x such that the result of the multiplication $Ax$ will have a mean value of b and a low variance in every element. However, I am struggling to figure out how to find the best solution for x with this information. If I just use non-negative least squares to solve for this, I run into some issues. I would imagine that, if column j has many elements with extremely large standard deviations, the jth element of x should be very small. This is because it would not be advantageous to include noisy matrix elements when trying to generate an approximation of b with little variance. However, all versions of the non-negative least squares algorithm, that I have seen, do not consider the possibility of noise or any randomness.

Here is the problem: $n$ balls are labeled $1$ to $n$ , and $n$ boxes are also labeled $1$ to $n$ . Now put these $n$ balls randomly into these $n$ boxes, such that each box contains only one ball. If a ball is in the box with the same number it has (e.g. ball #3 is in box #3), then we say that this ball is in the right box. Let $X$ be the number of balls that are in the right boxes, what is the expected value of $X$ ? Here are the two solutions I have: Solution 1: The probability that at least $k$ balls are in the right box is $$P(X\ge k)=\frac{\binom{n}{k}(n-k)!}{n!}=\frac{1}{k!},\quad k=0,1,2,\dots,n,$$ so the expected value of $X$ is $$E(X)=\sum_{k=0}^n P(X\ge k)=\sum_{k=0}^n\frac{1}{k!}.$$ Solution 2: For $j=1,\dots,n$ , let $X_j$ be the random variable such that $$X_j=\begin{cases}1, &\text{if ball }\#j\text{ is in the right box},\\ 0, &\text{otherwise},\end{cases}$$ Then we have $X=\sum_{j=1}^n X_j$ .

The probability that the i-th experiment will be over within an hour from the moment it began is $\frac{i}{10}, 1\leq i\leq 10$ 1st part: (Assuming all the experiments are started at the same time,) what is the expected number of experiments that will be over within an hour? The solution just says 1 (without further explanation) but I disagree. At least one (the 10th experiment) will be over within an hour with probability 1, and the rest also have non-zero probability to end within the same time, so the expectancy has to be at least greater than 1. My way of solving this was to define each experiment as a random variable $x_i$ such that $$ x_i= \begin{cases} \displaystyle 1,  & \text{w.p. $\frac{i}{10}$ } \\ 0, & \text{w.p. $\frac{10-i}{10}$ } \end{cases} $$ each with expectancy $E[x_i]=\frac{i}{10}$ , and then define $$Y=\sum_{i=1}^{10} x_i$$ Thus, the expectancy would be $$ E[Y]=E[\sum_{i=1}^{10} x_i]=\sum_{i=1}^{10}E[x_i]=\sum_{i=1}^{10}\frac{i}{10}=5.5 $$ By linearity of expectation. To verify my solution, I tried calculating $P(y)$ for each $y, 0\leq y\leq 10$ and then finding out the expectancy using its definition for discrete random variables. I've got the values for $y=0, 1, 9, 10$ but the rest were too difficult to generalize. The 2nd part is as follows (it's unrelated to the 1st one, just to the main question): What's the probability that the 5th experiment was over (within an hour), given a randomly selected experiment is over? It wasn't quite clear in the question, but I'm assuming that they meant all the experiments had started, and after an hour we picked one randomly and it was over, what's the probability that it's the 5th one? I calculated the probability for a randomly selected experiment to be over by multipling the probability for each experiment to be over with the probability for choosing it (using the law of total probability). Each experiment is equally likely to be choosen, so $$ P(B)=\sum_{i=1}^{10}\frac{i}{10}\frac{1}{10}=0.55 $$ Then, if $A_5$ is the event that the 5th experiment was over, $$ P(A_5 | B)=\frac{P(B|A_5)P(A_5)}{P(B)}=\frac{1\cdot \frac{1}{10}}{0.55}=0.182 $$ But in the solution they defined $A_5$ as the event that the 5th experiment was choosen (so in general $P(A_i)=\frac{1}{10}$ for every $i$ ) and said $$ P(A_5 | B)=\frac{P(B|A_5)P(A_5)}{P(B)}=\frac{\frac{5}{10}\cdot \frac{1}{10}}{0.55}=0.091 $$ But this doesn't make much sense to me.

In this example, data is lost when the FIFO is full and I have a new event that needs to be written. Until now, I've designed FIFOs by using simulations, and adjusting their size according to the data loss that I experience.
