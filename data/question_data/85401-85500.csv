Thanks!","Statement of the open mapping theorem: Let $X, Y$ be Banach spaces, $T:X\to Y$ be a continuous linear transformation. If T is onto, then T is an open map (i.e. for any open set $O\subset X$, $T(O)\subset Y$ is open. [EDITED] Claim: It suffices [in proving that T is an open map] to show that $T(B_X(1))$ contains an open ball centered at the origin, where $B_X(1)$ is the open ball of radius 1 centered at the origin in $X$. I'm not seeing how this condition implies that all open sets map to open sets. Linearity of T seems to be important here, but nothing is coming to mind except the definition $T(af+bg)=aT(f)+bT(g)$ for $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$, $f,g\in X$. Would greatly appreciate some insight.

For which $K$ does there exist such a function $f$ , and for which $K$ is $f$ unique? If we changed the expression $\int_0^1xf(x) \, dx$ to simply $\int_0^1f(x) \, dx$ , is it easy to see that any $K\in(0,1)$ works and we certainly do not have any uniqueness. In the case $f(x)=x^\alpha$ for $\alpha\in\mathbb Z_{>0}$ we get $\int_0^1xf(x) \, dx=1/(\alpha+2)$ , so at least rational numbers of this form are attainable.

While thinking about this, I've realized, that the problem of Fourier-series is an example of the same vector space having two bases with different cardinality. A function which equals its Fourier-series can be viewed as a vector expanded in a continous basis in time domain and in discrete basis in frequency domain. So this problem is definitely not a contradiction, there exist vector spaces with countable and uncountable basis at the same time.

My problem: I've looked at the solution I've been given to the second implication, but I don't see how it actually shows what I'm trying to prove, and I would like help being convinced of it. Here is an outline of the procedure employed in the solutions. Start by assuming that $f\neq g$ on a set of positive measure, say $F\subset \mathbb R$. Then, $F=\{x:f(x)\neq g(x)\}$. As far as I can see, this is tantamount to assuming that $f$ is not equal to $g$ almost everywhere. Then you consider $F$ as $F=\{x:f(x)\gt g(x)\}\cup\{x:f(x)\lt g(x)\}$, and label each as $F_1$ and $F_2$ respectively. It then follows, since we have assumed $F$ to have positive measure, that either $F_1$ or $F_2$ has positive measure. Without loss of generality, we take $F_1$ to have positive measure. This means that $\forall x\in F_1,\,f(x)-g(x)\gt0$. We move then to compute $\int_{F_1}(f-g)dm$. To determine this integral, we use the fact that for a measurable subset $E\subset\mathbb R$ of positive measure and $f\in\mathcal L(\mathbb R^n,m),$ where $f$ is strictly positive on $E$,then $\int_Ef\,dm>0$. We apply this here to see that $\int_{F_1}(f-g)dm>0$, and then, using the properties of the Lebesgue integral, are able to draw that $\int_{F_1}f\,dm\neq\int_{F_1}g\,dm$. Now I understand all the little facets used throughout the proof, but I just don't see how it shows the second implication of the problem, namely, that if $\int_Ef\,dm=\int_Eg\,dm$ for every measurable set $E$ then $f$ and $g$ are equal almost everywhere, is true? How is this reasoning sufficient to deduce this? Are there any final details that I have missed that might better tie this all together?","Consider the following problem, in particular, the second implication : ""Prove that $f$ and $g$ are equal almost everywhere if and only if $\int_Ef\,dm=\int_Eg\,dm$ for every measurable set $E$.""
