22,Is $2048$ the highest power of $2$ with all even digits (base ten)?,Is  the highest power of  with all even digits (base ten)?,2048 2,"I have a friend who turned $32$ recently.  She has an obsessive compulsive disdain for odd numbers, so I pointed out that being $32$ was pretty good since not only is it even, it also has no odd factors.  That made me realize that $64$ would be an even better age for her, because it's even, has no odd factors, and has no odd digits .  I then wondered how many other powers of $2$ have this property.  The only higher power of $2$ with all even digits that I could find was $2048.$ So is there a larger power of $2$ with all even digits?  If not, how would you go about proving it? I tried examining the last $N$ digits of powers of $2$ to look for a cycle in which there was always at least one odd digit in the last $N$ digits of the consecutive powers.  Unfortunately, there were always a very small percentage of powers of $2$ whose last $N$ digits were even. Edit: Here's a little more info on some things I found while investigating the $N$ digit cycles. $N$ : $2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9$ Cycle length: $20,100,500,2500,12500,62520,312500,1562500,\dotsc, 4\cdot 5^{N-1}$ Number of suffixes with all even digits in cycle: $10, 25, 60, 150, 370, 925, 2310,5780,\sim4\cdot2.5^{N-1}$ It seems there are some interesting regularities there.  Unfortunately, one of the regularities is those occurrences of all even numbers!  In fact, I was able to find a power of $2$ in which the last $33$ digits were even $(2^{3789535319} = \dots 468088628828226888000862880268288)$ . Yes it's true that it took a power of $2$ with over a billion digits to even get the last $33$ to be even, so it would seem any further powers of $2$ with all even digits are extremely unlikely.  But I'm still curious as to how you might prove it. Edit 2: Here's another interesting property I noticed.  The next digit to the left of the last $N$ digits will take on every value of its parity as the $N$ digits cycle each time.  Let me illustrate. The last $2$ digits cycle every $20$ powers.  Now examine the following: $2^7 =    128$ $2^{27} = \dots 728$ $2^{47} = \dots 328$ $2^{67} = \dots 928$ $2^{87} = \dots 528$ $2^{107} = \dots 128$ Notice that the hundreds place starts out odd and then proceeds to take on every odd digit as the final 2 digits cycle. As another example, let's look at the fourth digit (knowing that the last 3 digits cycle every 100 powers.) $2^{18} = 262144$ , $2^{118} = \dots 6144$ , $2^{218} = \dots 0144$ , $2^{318} = \dots 4144$ , $2^{418} = \dots 8144$ , $2^{518} = \dots 2144$ This explains the power of 5 in the cycle length as each digit must take on all five digits of its parity. EDIT 3: It looks like the $(N+1)$ st digit takes on all the values $0-9$ as the last $N$ digits complete half a cycle.  For instance, the last $2$ digits cycle every $20$ powers, so look at the third digit every $10$ powers: $2^{8}	= 256$ , $2^{18} = \dots 144$ , $2^{28}	= \dots 456$ , $2^{38}	= \dots 944$ , $2^{48}	= \dots 656$ , $2^{58}	= \dots 744$ , $2^{68}	= \dots 856$ , $2^{78}	= \dots 544$ , $2^{88}	= \dots 056$ , $2^{98}	= \dots 344$ Not only does the third digit take on every value 0-9, but it also alternates between odd and even every time (as the Edit 2 note would require.)  Also, the N digits cycle between two values, and each of the N digits besides the last one alternates between odd and even.  I'll make this more clear with one more example which looks at the fifth digit: $2^{20}	= \dots 48576$ , $2^{270}	= \dots 11424$ , $2^{520}	= \dots 28576$ , $2^{770}	= \dots 31424$ , $2^{1020}	= \dots 08576$ , $2^{1270}	= \dots 51424$ , $2^{1520}	= \dots 88576$ , $2^{1770}	= \dots 71424$ , $2^{2020}	= \dots 68576$ , $2^{2270}	= \dots 91424$ EDIT 4: Here's my next non-rigorous observation.  It appears that as the final N digits cycle 5 times, the $(N+2)$ th digit is either odd twice and even three times, or it's odd three times and even twice.  This gives a method for extending an all even suffix. If you have an all even N digit suffix of $2^a$ , and the (N+1) th digit is odd, then one of the following will have the (N+1) th digit even: $2^{(a+1*4*5^{N-2})}$ , $2^{(a+2*4*5^{N-2})}$ , $2^{(a+3*4*5^{N-2})}$ Edit 5: It's looking like there's no way to prove this conjecture solely by examining the last N digits since we can always find an arbitrarily long, all even, N digit sequence.  However, all of the digits are distributed so uniformly through each power of 2 that I would wager that not only does every power of 2 over 2048 have an odd digit, but also, every power of 2 larger than $2^{168}$ has every digit represented in it somewhere. But for now, let's just focus on the parity of each digit.  Consider the value of the $k^{th}$ digit of $2^n$ (with $a_0$ representing the 1's place.) $$ a_k = \left\lfloor\frac{2^n}{10^k}\right\rfloor \text{ mod 10}\Rightarrow a_k = \left\lfloor\frac{2^{n-k}}{5^k}\right\rfloor \text{ mod 10} $$ We can write $$2^{n-k} = d\cdot5^k + r$$ where $d$ is the divisor and $r$ is the remainder of $2^{n-k}/5^k$ .  So $$ a_k \equiv \frac{2^{n-k}-r}{5^k} \equiv d \pmod{10} $$ $$\Rightarrow a_k \equiv d \pmod{2}$$ And $$d\cdot5^k = 2^{n-k} - r \Rightarrow d \equiv r \pmod{2}$$ Remember that $r$ is the remainder of $2^{n-k} \text{ div } {5^k}$ so $$\text{The parity of $a_k$ is the same as the parity of $2^{n-k}$ mod $5^k$.}$$ Now we just want to show that for any $2^n > 2048$ we can always find a $k$ such that $2^{n-k} \text{ mod }5^k$ is odd. I'm not sure if this actually helps or if I've just sort of paraphrased the problem. EDIT 6: Thinking about $2^{n-k}$ mod $5^k$ , I realized there's a way to predict some odd digits. $$2^a \pmod{5^k} \text{ is even for } 1\le a< log_2 5^k$$ The period of $2^a \pmod{5^k}$ is $4\cdot5^{k-1}$ since 2 is a primitive root mod $5^k$ .  Also $$2^{2\cdot5^{k-1}} \equiv -1 \pmod{5^k}$$ So multiplying any $2^a$ by $2^{2\cdot5^{k-1}}$ flips its parity mod $5^k$ .  Therefore $2^a \pmod{5^k}\text{ }$ is odd for $$1 + 2\cdot5^{k-1} \le a< 2\cdot5^{k-1} + log_2 5^k$$ Or taking the period into account, $2^a \pmod{5^k} \text{ }$ is odd for any integer $b\ge0$ such that $$1 + 2\cdot5^{k-1} (1 + 2b) \le a< 2\cdot5^{k-1} (1 + 2b) + log_2 5^k$$ Now for the $k^{th}$ digit of $2^n$ ( $ k=0 \text{ } $ being the 1's digit), we're interested in the parity of $2^{n-k}$ mod $5^k$ .  Setting $ a =n-k \text{  } $ we see that the $k^{th}$ digit of $2^n$ is odd for integer $b\ge0$ such that $$1 + 2\cdot5^{k-1} (1 + 2b) \le n - k < 2\cdot5^{k-1} (1 + 2b) + log_2 5^k$$ To illustrate, here are some guaranteed odd digits for different $2^n$ : (k=1 digit): $ 2\cdot5^0 + 2 = 4 \le n \le 5 $ (k=2 digit): $ 2\cdot5^1 + 3 = 13 \le n \le 16 $ (k=3 digit): $ 2\cdot5^2 + 4 = 54 \le n \le 59 $ (k=4 digit): $ 2\cdot5^3 + 5 = 255 \le n \le 263 $ Also note that these would repeat every $4\cdot5^{k-1}$ powers. These guaranteed odd digits are not dense enough to cover all of the powers, but might this approach be extended somehow to find more odd digits? Edit 7: The two papers that Zander mentions below make me think that this is probably a pretty hard problem.","I have a friend who turned recently.

Or at least where $\eqref{1}$ and $\eqref{2}$ hold, but the prime factorizations of $a,b,c$ do not consist of the same primes, even if $\eqref{3}$ happens to hold for a different reason? In the comments, Peter and Gerry Myerson have checked small cases (all triples for $1 \le a \le b \le 10^5$ and primitive triples generated by $(m,n)$ for $1 \le n \le m \le 2000$) without finding any atypical solutions. Here is an in-depth explanation for why typical solutions like $(90,120,150)$ work. By a typical solution, I mean a solution where $a,b,c$ have the same primes in their prime factorization. Such a triple satisfies $\eqref{2}$ and $\eqref{3}$ whenever it satisfies $\eqref{1}$, as shown below. Let $\operatorname{rad}(x)$ denote the radical of $x$: the product of all distinct prime factors of $x$. To get a typical solution, we start with any Pythagorean triple, then scale $(a,b,c)$ so that $\operatorname{rad}(a) = \operatorname{rad}(b) = \operatorname{rad}(c) = r$. It is a general totient function identity that whenever $\operatorname{rad}(x) = r$, $\phi(x) = \frac{\phi(r)}{r} \cdot x$. In other words, $\phi(x) = x \prod\limits_{p \mid x} \frac{p-1}{p}$ where the product is over all primes $p$ that divide $x$. In the case above, we have $$    \phi(a^2) + \phi(b^2) = \frac{\phi(r)}{r} \cdot a^2 + \frac{\phi(r)}{r} \cdot b^2 = \frac{\phi(r)}{r} \cdot c^2 = \phi(c^2), $$ and $\eqref{2}$ holds. Moreover, since $r \mid a,b,c$, we have $r^2 \mid a^2,b^2,c^2$, so when we multiply by $\frac{\phi(r)}{r}$, we have $r \phi(r) \mid \phi(a^2), \phi(b^2), \phi(c^2)$. Therefore all prime factors of $r \phi(r)$ divide each of $\phi(a^2)$, $\phi(b^2)$, and $\phi(c^2)$. These are all their prime factors, since $r$ contained all the prime factors of $a^2, b^2,c^2$ and since then the only new prime factors introduced came from multiplying by $\phi(r)$. As a result, $\phi(a^2), \phi(b^2), \phi(c^2)$ still have the same set of prime factors: $\operatorname{rad}(\phi(a^2)) = \operatorname{rad}(r \phi(r)) = s$, and similarly $\operatorname{rad}(\phi(b^2)) = \operatorname{rad}(\phi(c^2)) = s$. So $\eqref{3}$ holds, because $$    \phi(\phi(a^2)) + \phi(\phi(b^2)) = \frac{\phi(s)}{s} \cdot \phi(a^2) + \frac{\phi(s)}{s} \cdot \phi(b^2) = \frac{\phi(s)}{s} \cdot \phi(c^2) = \phi(\phi(c^2)). $$","Suppose you have three positive integers $a, b, c$ that form a Pythagorean triple: \begin{equation}   a^2 + b^2 = c^2. \tag{1}\label{1} \end{equation} Additionally, suppose that when you apply Euler's totient function to each term, the equation still holds: $$   \phi(a^2) + \phi(b^2) = \phi(c^2). \tag{2}\label{2} $$ One way this can happen is if $a^2, b^2, c^2$ have the same primes in their prime factorization.

29,Is There An Injective Cubic Polynomial $\mathbb Z^2 \rightarrow \mathbb Z$?,Is There An Injective Cubic Polynomial ?,\mathbb Z^2 \rightarrow \mathbb Z,"Earlier, I was curious about whether a polynomial mapping $\mathbb Z^2\rightarrow\mathbb Z$ could be injective, and if so, what the minimum degree of such a polynomial could be. I've managed to construct such a quartic and rule out the existence of such a quadratic, but this leaves open the question of whether a cubic might exist. Equivalently my question is: Can a cubic polynomial of two variables with integer coefficients be injective? My intuition is that there probably is such a function since there is a quadratic bijection $\mathbb N^2\rightarrow\mathbb N$ so if we allow ourselves an extra ""degree"" to compensate for the transition from $\mathbb N$ to $\mathbb Z$, it seems like it ought to be sufficient. However, I have yet to come up with an example that I suspect of being injective nor any general method I might use to try to prove injectivity. The Part of This Post That Isn't A Question, But That Helps Motivate It Or Maybe Inspire Someone: So far I have determined that there is an injective quartic and there is not an injective quadratic. To construct the quartic which is injective, note that the map $f:\mathbb N^2 \rightarrow \mathbb N$ defined by $f(x,y)=(x+y)^2+y$ is injective and so is the map $g:\mathbb Z\rightarrow \mathbb N$ defined by $g(n)=2n^2-n$. Then, one can set $$P(x,y)=f(g(x),g(y))$$ as an injective polynomial (of degree $4$) in the two variables. No quadratic polynomial may exist because any integer valued polynomial of degree two has a (non-zero) multiple expressible as: $$P(x,y)=(ax+P_1(y))^2+P_2(y)$$ where $P_1$ and $P_2$ are polynomials with integer coefficients. Then, if we choose some $y_1$ and a $y_2$ such that $y_1\equiv y_2 \pmod{4aP_1(y_1)}$, we clearly have that $P_1(y_1)\equiv P_1(y_2)\pmod a$ and that $P_2(y_1)-P_2(y_2)=4aP_1(y_1)k$ for integer $k$. Then, we can choose two integers $c_1$ and $c_2$ such that $$c_1^2-c_2^2=P_2(y_2) - P_2(y_1) $$ $$c_1\equiv c_2 \equiv P_1(y_1)\equiv P_1(y_2) \pmod a$$ In particular the values $$c_1=P_1(y_1)+ak$$ $$c_2=P_1(y_1)-ak$$ satify the above. Then, choosing $$x_1=\frac{c_1-P_1(y_1)}{a}$$ $$x_2=\frac{c_2-P_1(y_2)}{a}$$ yields that $P(x_1,y_1)=P(x_2,y_2)$, since their difference is $(c_1^2-c_2^2) - (P_2(y_2)-P_2(y_1))$ which we chose the $c$'s to make $0$.

However, the statement $f(x,y)$ is injective is equivalent to asserting that $t\mapsto f(m_1t + b_1,m_2t+b_2)$ is injective for all $m_1,b_1,m_2,b_2\in\mathbb Z$ with not both $m$ equalling $0$ - so this could be used to eliminate some cases, if nothing else.","Earlier, I was curious about whether a polynomial mapping $\mathbb Z^2\rightarrow\mathbb Z$ could be injective, and if so, what the minimum degree of such a polynomial could be. I've managed to construct such a quartic and rule out the existence of such a quadratic, but this leaves open the question of whether a cubic might exist. Equivalently my question is: Can a cubic polynomial of two variables with integer coefficients be injective? My intuition is that there probably is such a function since there is a quadratic bijection $\mathbb N^2\rightarrow\mathbb N$ so if we allow ourselves an extra ""degree"" to compensate for the transition from $\mathbb N$ to $\mathbb Z$, it seems like it ought to be sufficient.

32,Gross-Zagier formulae outside of number theory,Gross-Zagier formulae outside of number theory,,"(Edit: I have asked this question on MO. ) The Gross-Zagier formula and various variations of it form the starting point in most of the existing results towards the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture. It relates the value at $1$ of the derivative of the $L$-function of an elliptic curve $E$ to the canonical height of a very special rational point on $E$ called a Heegner point. Let me describe the Gross-Zagier formula in the simplest case. Setup . Let $E/\mathbf Q$ be an elliptic curve. According to the modularity theorem, there exists a finite $\mathbf Q$-morphism $p :X_0(N) \to E$ mapping the cusp $\infty$ to the origin of $E$, where $N$ is the conductor of $E$. Let $K\subseteq \mathbf C$ be an imaginary quadratic field, other than $\mathbf Q[i]$ or $\mathbf Q[\sqrt{-3}]$, in which the prime factors of $N$ split. Then we can choose an ideal $\mathcal J$ in $\mathcal O_K$, such that $\mathcal O_K/J \simeq \mathbf Z/N\mathbf Z$. Viewing $\mathcal J$ as a lattice in $\mathbf C$, we can form the elliptic curves $C_\mathcal J = \mathbf C/\mathcal J$ and $C_K = \mathbf C/\mathcal O_K$. While they are a priori elliptic curves over $\mathbf C$, we know from the theory of complex multiplication that they are actually defined over the Hilbert class field $H$ of $K$. Anyways, the inclusion $\mathcal J \subseteq \mathcal O_K$ induces by passage to the quotient an isogeny $C_\mathcal J \to C_K$ of degree $N$, which is precisely the kind of gadget that $X_0(N)$ parametrizes as a moduli space. Thus we get a point in $X_0(N)(H)$. We can take the image of this point via the modular parametrization $p$ to get a point $y_J \in E(H)$. Taking the sum of its Galois conjugates down to $K$ we get a point $y_K \in E(K)$, which, it turns out, doesn't depend on the choice of $\mathcal J$, up to sign and up to torsion. This means that its Néron-Tate height $\hat{h}(y_K)$ is a well-defined non-negative real number, which, by the non-degeneracy of the height pairing, is zero if and only if $y_K$ is a torsion point on $E$. With this setup, Gross and Zagier proved: Theorem : $$L'(E/K, 1) = \hat{h}(y_K) \frac{\iint_{E(\mathbf C)} \omega \wedge i\omega}{\sqrt D},$$ where $\omega$ is the invariant differential on $E$ (suitably normalized), and $D$ is the discriminant of $K$. Since the factor $\frac{\iint_{E(\mathbf C)} \omega \wedge i\omega}{\sqrt D}$ is never zero, we have: Corollary : Suppose that $L(E/K, s)$ has a simple zero at $s=1$. Then $y_K$ is a point of infinite order in $E(K)$, and in particular, $\text{Rank}_\mathbf{Z}E(K)>0$. Thus, we have an example of a situation where the vanishing of $L(E/K, s)$ at $s=1$ implies the existence of an (explicit!) point of infinite order in $E(K)$ -- a behavior which is, of course, predicted by the BSD conjecture (minus the ""explicit"" part, which comes as a surprise). If we believe BSD, it is natural to make the following: Conjecture (Gross-Zagier): Suppose that $L'(E/K, 1)$ is nonzero, or equivalently, that $\hat{h}(y_K)$ is nonzero, or still equivalently, that $y_K$ is non-torsion. Then $E(K)$ has rank exactly one, and $\left<y_K\right>$ has finite index in it. This conjecture was proven by Kolyvagin. In any case, since $\hat{h}(y_K) = \left<y_K, y_K\right>$ where $\left<,\right>$ is the Néron-Tate height pairing on $E$, we can rewrite the Gross-Zagier formula as $$L'(E/K, 1) = \left<y_K, y_K\right> \times C$$ where $C$ is the nonzero constant of the formula. Let me now tell you about something completely different, namely the Minakshisundaram-Pleijel zeta function. (I don't know enough about this, so please forgive any inaccuracies.) Given a compact Riemannian manifold $M$, one has the Laplace-Beltrami operator $\Delta$ on $M$ which generalizes the familiar Laplacian on $\mathbf R^n$. The spectrum of this operator is an important invariant of $M$, and it is encoded in the M-P zeta function $$\zeta(\Delta, s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \lambda_n^{-s}.$$ It admits a meromorphic continuation to the whole plane, and is holomorphic at $s=0$. Its Taylor coefficients at $0$ around contain geometric data about $M$. Let us specialize to the case where $M$ is a surface; then $$\zeta'(\Delta, 0) = \frac{1}{12}\int_M K dA$$ where $K$ is the Gaussian curvature. According to the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, this is essentially the Euler characteristic, so: $$\zeta'(\Delta, 0) = \chi(M) \times C.$$ But there is a more suggestive way of writing the Euler characteristic. The diagonal $D \subseteq M \times M$ determines a cohomology class (its Poincaré dual) on $M \times M$; moreover it lies in the piece of the cohomology of $M\times M$ which is self-dual with respect to Poincaré duality, so the expression $\left<D, D\right>$ makes sense (it is the ""self-intersection"" number of the diagonal). In fact, as is well-known, $\left<D, D\right>$ is precisely the Euler characteristic of $M$. So, we can write  $$\zeta'(\Delta , 0) = \left<D, D\right> \times C.$$ Corollary: If $\zeta'(\Delta, 0) \neq 0$, then $D$ is a nontrivial cohomology class on $M\times M$. Thus, we have a (completely different!) example of a situation where the non-vanishing of the derivative of a zeta function implies the existence of a non-trivial cohomology class which ""accounts"" the non-vanishing (viewing a rational point on $E(K)$ as a degree $0$ Galois cohomology class). Questions : Is the similarity between the two formulas, and between their Corollaries, coincidental? (This question probably doesn't have a precise answer, but I feel that it's worth asking.) And, assuming that the answer to this question is not completely disappointing... Have things like this been pointed out before?

Show that $x^p+y^p=z^p$ has a solution in $\mathbb{Z}_p^{\times}$ if and only if there exists an integer $a$ such that $p\not\mid a(a+1)$ and $$(a+1)^p=a^p+1\pmod{p^2}.$$ (I wil not show this here, it's a good exercise in Hensel's lemma) Now I'm interested for which primes this last property holds true. This is what I found so far: Proposition: for every prime $p\equiv 1\pmod{3}$ there exists an $a\in\mathbb{Z}$ such that $p\not\mid a(a+1)$ and $p^2\mid(a+1)^p-a^p-1$ . Sketch of proof: We will often use the fact that if $p\mid a-b$ then $p^2\mid a^p-b^p$ for $a,b,p\in\mathbb{Z}$ . There exists some $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ such that $p \mid n^2+n+1$ . We will show that we can take $a=n$ (it is clear that $p\not \mid n(n+1)$ ). If $n\equiv 1\pmod{p}$ , we are done because $(n+1)^p\equiv 2\equiv n^p+1\pmod{p^2}$ . So we may assume that the order of $n$ mod $p$ is 3. We see that $n^{3p}\equiv 1\pmod{p^2}$ , hence $p^2\mid \frac{n^{3p}-1}{n^p-1}=n^{2p}+n^p+1$ and therefore $(n+1)^p\equiv -n^{2p}\equiv n^p+1\pmod{p^2}$ . $\blacksquare$ What can we say about primes $p\equiv 2\pmod{3}$ ? Say a prime is bad if it satisfies the above property. It is easy to see that for $p$ to be good we only have to check that for all $1\le a \le (p-1)/2$ we have $p^2\not\mid (a+1)^p-a^p-1$ . Numerical data suggests that infinitely many primes $p\equiv 2\pmod{3}$ are good and infinitely many are bad. I'd like to find a proof of this. My numerical data furthermore suggests that there is no easy divisibility criterion to judge badness for primes, and that that there are a lot more good primes than bad ones, in terms of asymptotics. I welcome all comments/ideas/references. Edit: Here are some observations. I've listed the first bad primes, together with the set of $a\in\mathbb{Z}$ such that $1\le a \le (p-1)/2$ and $(a+1)^p\equiv a^p+1\pmod{p^2}$ : $59\qquad [3, 4, 11, 14, 15, 20]  \\ 83\qquad [8, 30, 36]  \\ 179\qquad [2, 59, 88]  \\ 227\qquad [36, 82, 92]  \\ 419\qquad[80, 110, 150]  \\ 443\qquad [108, 125, 201]  \\ 701\qquad [23, 61, 132, 146, 153, 252]  \\ 857\qquad [6, 143, 244]  \\ 887\qquad [20, 132, 168]  \\ 911\qquad [14, 64, 242]  \\ 929 \qquad[234, 253, 266]  \\ 971 \qquad[9, 97, 108]  \\ 977 \qquad[102, 182, 331] \\  1091\qquad [64, 234, 358]  \\ 1109 \qquad[176, 400, 523]  \\ 1193\qquad [224, 227, 473]  \\ 1217\qquad [186, 228, 410]  \\ 1223\qquad [304, 349, 409]  \\ 1259\qquad [19, 62, 264]  \\ 1283\qquad [19, 134, 449]  \\ 1289\qquad [412, 535, 593]  \\ 1439\qquad [93, 199, 294]  \\ 1487\qquad [167, 416, 649]  \\ 1493 \qquad[141, 179, 367]  \\ 1613 \qquad[227, 473, 739]  \\ 1637 \qquad[76, 279, 574]  \\ 1811 \qquad[39, 123, 498, 628, 691, 743]  \\ 1847\qquad [172, 362, 698]  \\ 1901\qquad [3, 475, 634]  \\ 1997\qquad [125, 671, 840]  \\ 2003 \qquad[31, 312, 840]  \\ 2087 \qquad[31, 202, 586]  \\ 2243 \qquad[252, 593, 1077]  \\ 2423\qquad [353, 704, 857]  \\ 2477\qquad [17, 688, 1020]  \\ 2579 \qquad[294, 576, 693]  \\ 2591 \qquad[322, 345, 368]  \\ 2729\qquad [1024, 1049, 1089] \\  2777\qquad [488, 1078, 1269]  \\ 2969\qquad [341, 789, 1158]  \\ 3089\qquad [677, 1015, 1053]\\ 3137\qquad [1227, 1308, 1427]\\ 3191\qquad [776, 916, 1383]\\ 3203\qquad [1214, 1305, 1587]\\ 3251\qquad [164, 337, 1260]$ I also found this sequence on OEIS , along with more numerical data , where it is claimed (but not proved) that the density of bad primes is roughly $\frac 16$ .

38,Can we remove any prime number with this strange process?,Can we remove any prime number with this strange process?,,"This is a prime-removal algorithm I made, which may appear to be quite complex so I will start with an example. @Max has since added this sequence to OEIS, number A332198 . The process goes as follows: Start with the first prime number, $$S(1)=2.$$ From $2$ , add the next prime number $3$ to get $$S(2)=2+3=5.$$ There are no non-trivial factors, so we move on. From $2+3$ , add the next prime number $5$ to get $$S(3)=2+3+5=10.$$ Since $10=2\times5$ and these two numbers appear in the sum, we remove $2$ and $5$ . We are left with $3$ . From $3$ , add the next prime number $5$ to get $$S(4)=3+5=8.$$ Now $8=2\times2\times2$ , but $2$ does not appear in the sum, so we move on. From $3+5$ , add the next prime number $7$ to get $$S(5)=3+5+7=15.$$ Since $15=3\times5$ and these two numbers appear in the sum, we remove $3$ and $5$ . We are left with $7$ . (and so on) So essentially, we keep on adding consecutive prime numbers until we reach a sum whose prime factorisation contains some of those primes. We remove those primes and start the process once again. Great, except... There is one more rule that needs to be added. If we continue doing this, we soon find ourselves in a rather strange scenario. (and so on) a continuation: From $37+47+59+\cdots+241+251+257$ , add the next prime number $263$ to get $$S(57)=37+47+59+\cdots+251+257+263=5918.$$ Now $5918=2\times11\times269$ , but neither of the three primes appear in the sum, so we move on. From $37+47+59+\cdots+251+257+263$ , add the next prime number $269$ to get $$S(58)=37+47+59+\cdots+251+257+263+269=6187.$$ Since $6187=23\times269$ and $269$ appears in the sum, we remove $269$ . We are left with $37+47+59+\cdots+251+257+263$ . This is a cycle! The sequence of $263$ and $269$ will continue forever, if we don't add another rule to this process. Therefore, I call $269$ a cyclic prime, and I propose this new rule. From $37+47+59+\cdots+251+257+263$ , add the next non-cyclic prime number $271$ to get $$S(59)=37+47+59+\cdots+251+257+263+271=6189.$$ Now $6189=2\times2063$ and these two numbers do not appear in the sum, so we move on. I do not know whether there are any dicyclic primes; that is, primes that are still cyclic after more than one iteration. Questions Will every prime number in the sum eventually be removed? If not, which prime numbers will remain in the sum forever? It appears to be true. From this Python program by @EuxhenH, we see that all primes up to $16903$ are eliminated at some point before overflow. The table linked shows how long it takes ( $N$ iterations) for the smallest prime $P$ in the sum to be removed. It appears that $P$ increases as $N$ increases despite significant fluctuation. Follow-up: What is the asymptotic growth of $N(P)$ ? For instance, does it admit a $\log$ or $\log\log$ increase? Are there infinitely many cyclic prime numbers? As of writing, the only known cyclic prime numbers are $269$ and $94793$ . Using @Max's PARI/GP program, I plotted $S(n)$ for $n\le575$ which should grow like $Cx^a\log^bx$ . Note that this sequence, by definition, is bounded above by $$\sum_{i\le n}p_i\sim\frac12n^2\log n.$$ Indeed, when $a=2$ and $b=1$ , Mathematica gives an optimal value of $C\approx0.4716$ . However, the residual plot suggests there is perhaps a better asymptotic.","This is a prime-removal algorithm I made, which may appear to be quite complex so I will start with an example. @Max has since added this sequence to OEIS, number A332198 .

For each $k=0,1,\ldots, n−2$ expand $x^k\cdot(x+1)^n$ and replace $x^n$ by $r$. One thus obtains a linear system with $n−1$ equations with variables $x$, $x^2$, $x^3,\ldots x^{n−1}$. The matrix associated to this system has rational entries, and therefore if the solution is unique it must be rational (via Cramer's rule). This approach works fine if $n$ is small.

Lemke Oliver, here is the number $N$ (in million units) of such pairs for the first hundred million primes modulo $10$, $$\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline &a&b&\color{blue}N&&a&b&\color{blue}N&&a&b&\color{blue}N&&a&b&\color{blue}N\\ \hline &1&3&7.43&&3&7&7.04&&7&9&7.43&&9&1&7.99\\ &1&7&7.50&&3&9&7.50&&7&1&6.37&&9&3&6.37\\ &1&9&5.44&&3&1&6.01&&7&3&6.76&&9&7&6.01\\ &1&1&\color{brown}{4.62}&&3&3&\color{brown}{4.44}&&7&7&\color{brown}{4.44}&&9&9&\color{brown}{4.62}\\ \hline \text{Total}& & &24.99&& & &24.99&& & &25.00&& & &24.99\\ \hline \end{array}$$ As expected, each class $a$ has a total of $25$ million primes (after rounding). The ""shocking"" thing, according to the article, is that if the primes were truly random , then it is reasonable to expect that each subclass will have $\color{blue}{N=25/4 = 6.25}$. As the present data shows, this is apparently not the case. Argument : The disparity seems to make sense. For example, let $p=11$, so $a=1$ . Since $p,q$ are consecutive primes , then, of course, subsequent numbers are not chosen at random. Wouldn't it be more likely the next prime will end in the ""closer"" $3$ or $7$ such as $q=13$ or $q=17$, rather than looping back to the same end digit, like $q=31$? (I've taken the liberty of re-arranging the table to reflect this.) However, what is surprising is the article concludes, and I quote, ""...as the primes stretch to infinity, they do eventually shake off the pattern and give the random distribution mathematicians are used to expecting."" Question: What is an effective way to counter the argument given above and come up with the same conclusion as in the article? (Will all the $N$ eventually approach $N\to 6.25$, with the unit suitably adjusted?) Or is the conclusion based on a conjecture and may not be true?

Lemke Oliver, here is the number $N$ (in million units) of such pairs for the first hundred million primes modulo $10$, $$\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline &a&b&\color{blue}N&&a&b&\color{blue}N&&a&b&\color{blue}N&&a&b&\color{blue}N\\ \hline &1&3&7.43&&3&7&7.04&&7&9&7.43&&9&1&7.99\\ &1&7&7.50&&3&9&7.50&&7&1&6.37&&9&3&6.37\\ &1&9&5.44&&3&1&6.01&&7&3&6.76&&9&7&6.01\\ &1&1&\color{brown}{4.62}&&3&3&\color{brown}{4.44}&&7&7&\color{brown}{4.44}&&9&9&\color{brown}{4.62}\\ \hline \text{Total}& & &24.99&& & &24.99&& & &25.00&& & &24.99\\ \hline \end{array}$$ As expected, each class $a$ has a total of $25$ million primes (after rounding). The ""shocking"" thing, according to the article, is that if the primes were truly random , then it is reasonable to expect that each subclass will have $\color{blue}{N=25/4 = 6.25}$. As the present data shows, this is apparently not the case. Argument : The disparity seems to make sense. For example, let $p=11$, so $a=1$ . Since $p,q$ are consecutive primes , then, of course, subsequent numbers are not chosen at random. Wouldn't it be more likely the next prime will end in the ""closer"" $3$ or $7$ such as $q=13$ or $q=17$, rather than looping back to the same end digit, like $q=31$? (I've taken the liberty of re-arranging the table to reflect this.) However, what is surprising is the article concludes, and I quote, ""...as the primes stretch to infinity, they do eventually shake off the pattern and give the random distribution mathematicians are used to expecting."" Question: What is an effective way to counter the argument given above and come up with the same conclusion as in the article? (Will all the $N$ eventually approach $N\to 6.25$, with the unit suitably adjusted?) Or is the conclusion based on a conjecture and may not be true? P.S: A more enlightening popular article "" Mathematicians Discover Prime Conspiracy "". (It turns out the same argument is mentioned there, but with a subtle way to address it.)",,"['number-theory', 'prime-numbers', 'modular-arithmetic', 'congruences', 'random']"

This led me to the following question: Problem 1: Is $3$ the only positive integer value of $n$ such that $i(i-1)(i-2) \cdots (i-n)$ is a real number or a pure imaginary number? If not, can we describe all such integer values of $n$? Initial Analysis: We can view $i(i-1)(i-2) \cdots (i-n)$ as the result of applying a finite sequence of operations to $i,$ each of which involves a radial stretch from the origin and a rotation about the origin. Specifically, $i$ is moved radially outward by a factor of $\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2}\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2} \cdots \sqrt{1^2 + n^2}$ and rotated counterclockwise by the angle $\arctan 1 + \arctan 2 + \cdots + \arctan n.$ Since we don't care about the magnitude of the result, only whether we land on the real axis or the imaginary axis, Problem 1 reduces to asking whether $3$ is the only positive integer value of $n$ such that $\arctan 1 + \arctan 2 + \cdots \arctan n$ is an integer multiple of $\frac{\pi}{4}.$ One can also check that $i(i+1)(i+2)(i+3) = -10.$ This is not a coincidence. Since $\arctan 1 + \arctan 2 + \arctan 3$ is an integer multiple of $\frac{\pi}{4},$ it follows that $\arctan (-1) + \arctan (-2) + \arctan (-3) = -\left(\arctan 1 + \arctan 2 + \arctan 3 \right)$ must also be an integer multiple of $\frac{\pi}{4}.$ Other than the products $(i-3)(i-2)(i-1)(i)$ and $(i)(i+1)(i+2)(i+3)$ (and two other products obtained by omitting the $i$ factor from these two), and products of the form $(i-k)(i-k+1) \cdots (i+k-1)(i+k)$ where $k$ can be any positive integer, I don't know any product of the form $(i+m)(i+m+1) \cdots (i+n)$ for integers $m$ and $n$ with $m < n$ that equals a real number or a pure imaginary number.

If not, can we describe all such pairs of integers $(m,n)$? Of course, it is easy to come up problems having a broader scope, such as replacing ""$i+m$"" with an arbitrary complex number whose real and imaginary parts are integers and/or using factors that increment the imaginary part by $1$ (or increment both the real and imaginary parts by $1$) and/or using factors that increment the real part (or the imaginary part, or both the real part and the imaginary part) by a constant integer amount, etc. I suspect the answers to these problems can be obtained from a careful analysis of Carl Størmer's 1890s results involving Machin-like formulas , but my knowledge of French and of this field of mathematics is rather poor.

Define the symmetric summation $$ \mathfrak{S}(a_{1},\dots, a_{n}) = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} a_{i}^{\prime} \, \mathfrak{s}\left( \tfrac{a_{1} \cdots \hat{a}_{i} \cdots a_{n}}{a_{n+1}},  \tfrac{a_{i}}{a_{1}^{\prime} \cdots \hat{a}_{i}^{\prime} \cdots a_{n}^{\prime}} \right). $$ where $\hat{}$ denotes omission. For pairwise coprime $a_{1}, \dots, a_{n} \in \mathbb{N}$ (all primed variables equal $1$), I conjecture the following congruence holds for $n = 4$ (and I have a hunch that it continues to hold for $n > 4$): $$ 12 a_{1} \cdots a_{n} \, \mathfrak{S}(a_{1}, \dots, a_{n}) \equiv \left( \sum_{i = 1}^{n} (a_{1} \cdots \hat{a}_{i} \cdots a_{n})^{2} \right) + 1 \ \pmod{a_{1} \cdots a_{n}}. $$ Is this more general congruence known?",,"['number-theory', 'reference-request']"
60,How and why does Grothendieck's work provide tools to attack problems in number theory?,How and why does Grothendieck's work provide tools to attack problems in number theory?,,"This is probably a horrible question to experts, but I think it is reasonable from someone who knows nothing. I have always been fascinated with Grothendieck and the way he did mathematics. I've heard Mochizuki's work on the abc conjecture heavily involves Grothendick-ean algebro-geometric ideas (it kind of seems like everything does). I also know Grothendieck's work has been crucial in the development of tools and subsequent proof of the Weil conjectures. Moreover, I've generally seen Grothendieck's name pop up in all kinds of number-theoretic contexts. From what I've read about Grothendieck himself, it seems fair to say he wasn't very interested in numbers at all, at least not in the sense of solving specific problems like the abc conjecture. It also seems safe to say that Grothendieck's mathematics was not generally developed for the purpose of solving specific problems. And yet, his highly abstract ideas find use in one of the seemingly least ""functorial"" branches of math. Why is this? Knowing very little mathematics myself, I tried to read about Grothendieck's part in the proof of the Weil conjectures. The term "" algebraic geometry over the integers "" (page 15, third paragraph) caught my eye, and I have (falsely?) concluded that in a very rough sense, the generality in which Grothendieck worked gave algebraic geometry the flexibility needed to ""work"" over the integers. I have not been able to find anything as accessible about Mochizuki's work, and I can understand absolutely nothing from the discussions on MO. I also don't know any number theory, I'm just curious how such abstract mathematics can produce (even merely interact with) such incredibly concrete, specific results. So I guess my questions are: How do Grothendieck's ideas manifest in number theory? Why is this possible? Is it ""just"" about brilliantly applying algebro-geometric ideas to the integers? Exactly which ideas of Grothendieck's ideas appear in these number-theoretic contexts?

61,Intuition for the Importance of Modular Forms,Intuition for the Importance of Modular Forms,,"I am learning about modular forms for the first time this term and am just starting to wrap my head around what might be the big picture of things. I was wondering if the following interpretation of why modular forms are important is correct a) technically and b) in terms of getting the right picture. Possible Intuition for Importance of Modular Forms: We want arithmetic data about elliptic curves. Given a congruence subgroup $$\Gamma\in\{\Gamma_1(N),\Gamma_0(N),\Gamma(N)\}$$   we let $X(\Gamma)$ denote $\Gamma/\mathfrak{h}^\ast$ (where $\mathfrak{h}^\ast$ is the upper half-plane $\mathfrak{h}$ union the cusps $\mathbb{Q}\cup\{\infty\}$). We know then that $X(\Gamma)$ is the compactification of a moduli space whose points classify elliptic curves with some torsion data. Because of this, we want to understand the geometry of $X(\Gamma)$ because hopefully this will translate, via the moduli space concept, back to arithmetic data about elliptic curves. But, given a compact Riemann surface, one ideologically gets a lot of the information concerning the surface by studying meromorphic sections of certain holomorphic line bundles over $X$. A very natural line bundle attached to $X(\Gamma)$ is $(T_{X(\Gamma)}^{\ast1,0})^{\otimes n}$ (which is the $n^{\text{th}}$-tensor power of its holomorphic cotangent bundle). Thus, a natural place to look for geometric information about $X(\Gamma)$ is in the meromorphic sections of this bundle, denoted $\Omega^{\otimes n}(X(\Gamma))$. More specifically one may focus on the holomorphic sections $H^0(X(\Gamma),(T_{X(\Gamma)}^{\ast1,0})^{\otimes n})$ of this line bundle. That said, the natural equivalence map $\pi:\mathfrak{h}\to X(\Gamma)$ gives rise to the pullback map $\pi^\ast:\Omega^{\otimes n}(X(\Gamma))\to\Omega^{\otimes n}(\mathfrak{h})$. But, since $\mathfrak{h}$ has only one chart, we can naturally identify $\Omega^{\otimes n}(\mathfrak{h})$ with $\text{Mer}(\mathfrak{h})$. Thus, we have a linear embedding $\pi^\ast:\Omega^{\otimes n}(X(\Gamma))\to \text{Mer}(\mathfrak{h})$. Since $\text{Mer}(\mathfrak{h})$ is easier to deal with (at least its easier to ""see"") we would like to identify the objects of interest, $\Omega^{\otimes n}(X(\Gamma))$ and its subspace $H^0(X(\Gamma),(T_{X(\Gamma)}^{\ast 1,0})^{\otimes n})$, with their image under $\pi^\ast$. That said, one can prove that the image under $\pi^\ast$ of $\Omega^{\otimes n}(X(\Gamma))$ is $\mathcal{A}_{2n}(\Gamma)$ (the automorphic forms of weight $2n$ with respect to $\Gamma$) and the image of $H^0(X(\Gamma),(T_{X(\Gamma)}^{\ast 1,0})^{\otimes n})$ is contained in $\mathcal{M}_{2n}(\Gamma)$ (the modular forms of weight $2n$ with respect to $\Gamma$). Ok, assuming the above is correct, there are three questions that begged to be asked: Why do we care about all of $\mathcal{M}_{2n}(\Gamma)$? Why don't we care more specifically about the image of $H^0(X(\Gamma),(T_{X(\Gamma)}^{\ast 1,0})^{\otimes n})$ under $\pi^\ast$? Can we describe this image (e.g. it's the cups forms for $n=1$)? What do odd weight modular or automorphic forms tell us? If $-I\in\Gamma$ then there are no non-zero such objects, but in the cases when $-I\notin\Gamma$, do we gain anything by looking at odd weights? What does the geometry of $X(\Gamma)$ tell us about elliptic curves? For example, the genus of $X(\Gamma)$ tells us things about the objects we parameterize. That said, we don't need to study sections of line bundles to get this geometric data. Indeed, the genus for $X_0(1)$ can be deduced from the fact that the $j$-invariant has one simple pole, and thus must be induced a biholomorphism $j:X_0(1)\to\mathbb{P}^1$. From there, we can find the genus of $X(\Gamma)$ by using the natural projection $X(\Gamma)\to X_0(1)$ and the Riemann-Hurwitz formula. So, what geometric information about $X(\Gamma)$ is important that one needs automorphic/modular forms to get? Thank you so, so much friends!

62,Is this similarity to the Fourier transform of the von Mangoldt function real?,Is this similarity to the Fourier transform of the von Mangoldt function real?,,"Mathematica knows that the logarithm of $n$ is: $$\log(n) = \lim\limits_{s \rightarrow 1} \zeta(s)\left(1 - \frac{1}{n^{(s - 1)}}\right)$$ The von Mangoldt function should then be: $$\Lambda(n)=\lim\limits_{s \rightarrow 1} \zeta(s)\sum\limits_{d|n} \frac{\mu(d)}{d^{(s-1)}}.$$ Setting the first term of the von Mangoldt function $\Lambda(1)$ equal to the harmonic number $H_{\operatorname{scale}}$ where scale is equal to the scale of the Fourier transform matrix, one can calculate the Fourier transform of the von Mangoldt function with the Mathematica program at the link below: http://pastebin.com/ZNNYZ4F6 In the program I studied the function within the limit for the von Mangoldt function, and made some small changes to the function itself: $f(t)=\sum\limits_{n=1}^{n=k} \frac{1}{\log(k)} \frac{1}{n} \zeta(1/2+i \cdot t)\sum\limits_{d|n} \frac{\mu(d)}{d^{(1/2+i \cdot t-1)}}$ as $k$ goes to infinity. (Edit 20.9.2013: The function $f(t)$ had ""-1"" in the argument for the zeta function.) The plot of this function looks like this: While the plot of the Fourier transform of the von Mangoldt function with the program looks like this: There are some similarities but the Fourier transform converges faster towards smaller oscillations in between the spikes at zeta zeros and the scale factor is wrong. Will the function $f(t)$ above eventually converge to the Fourier transform of the von Mangoldt function, or is it only yet another meaningless plot? Now when I look at it I think the spikes at zeros comes from the zeta function itself and the spectrum like feature comes from the Möbius function which inverts the zeta function. In the Fourier transform the von Mangoldt function has this form: $$\log (\text{scale}) ,\log (2),\log (3),\log (2),\log (5),0,\log (7),\log (2),\log (3),0,\log (11),0,...,\Lambda(\text{scale})$$ $$scale = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,...k$$ Or as latex: $$\Lambda(n) = \begin{cases} \log q & \text{if }n=1, \\\log p & \text{if }n=p^k \text{ for some prime } p \text{ and integer } k \ge 1, \\ 0 & \text{otherwise.} \end{cases}$$ $$n=1,2,3,4,5,...q$$ TableForm[Table[Table[If[n == 1, Log[q], MangoldtLambda[n]], {n, 1, q}], {q, 1, 12}]] scale = 50;

(Edit 20.9.2013: The function $f(t)$ had ""-1"" in the argument for the zeta function.) The plot of this function looks like this: While the plot of the Fourier transform of the von Mangoldt function with the program looks like this: There are some similarities but the Fourier transform converges faster towards smaller oscillations in between the spikes at zeta zeros and the scale factor is wrong. Will the function $f(t)$ above eventually converge to the Fourier transform of the von Mangoldt function, or is it only yet another meaningless plot? Now when I look at it I think the spikes at zeros comes from the zeta function itself and the spectrum like feature comes from the Möbius function which inverts the zeta function. In the Fourier transform the von Mangoldt function has this form: $$\log (\text{scale}) ,\log (2),\log (3),\log (2),\log (5),0,\log (7),\log (2),\log (3),0,\log (11),0,...,\Lambda(\text{scale})$$ $$scale = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,...k$$ Or as latex: $$\Lambda(n) = \begin{cases} \log q & \text{if }n=1, \\\log p & \text{if }n=p^k \text{ for some prime } p \text{ and integer } k \ge 1, \\ 0 & \text{otherwise.} \end{cases}$$ $$n=1,2,3,4,5,...q$$ TableForm[Table[Table[If[n == 1, Log[q], MangoldtLambda[n]], {n, 1, q}], {q, 1, 12}]] scale = 50;

Since $364 = 2\cdot 2 \cdot 7 \cdot 13$ , the number of possible number that evenly divide a year are 2, 4, 7, 13, 14, 26, 28, and larger. Given this, 7 looks reasonable - 2 and 4 are too short and 13 is too long. Anyway, I noticed that 13 and 14 are there, and wondered how often this happens. I wasn't able to figure out a nice way to specify the probability (as in a Hardy-Littlewood product), and wasn't able to  do it from the inverse direction (i.e., sort of a sieve with n(n+1) going into the array of integers). Ideally, I would like an asymptotic function f(x) such that $\lim_{n \to \infty} \dfrac{\text{number of such integers } \ge 2 \le nx}{n} =f(x) $ or find $c$ such that $\lim_{n \to \infty} \dfrac{\text{number of such integers } \ge 2 \le n}{n} =c $ .

83,"Pattern ""inside"" prime numbers","Pattern ""inside"" prime numbers",,"Update $(2020)$ I've observed a possible characterization and a possible parametrization of the pattern, and I've additionally rewritten the entire post with more details and better definitions. It remains to prove the observed possible characterization, and then complete it by finding the sequences for locations of the ""parabolic shapes"" that live in the characterized regions. Table of contents: Visualization of factorizations Inside prime visualizations The pattern and the question Pattern parametrization Visualization of factorizations Here I will explain how we can visualize positive integers in an interesting way which also has the property that the factorization of $n$ is encoded into it in the form of a fractal-like pattern. $2$ -digit palindromes represent factorizations We say that a positive integer is palindromic in some integer number base ( number-system ) $b\ge 2$ if when written in that number base, its digits are read the same forward and backwards. The $2$ -digit palindrome is an integer $n=(a,a)_b=ab^1+ab^0=a(b+1),a\lt b,a\ge 1$ , where in the $(n_1,n_2,\dots)_b$ notation, $n_1,n_2,\dots$ stand for digits of $n$ in the integer base $b\ge 2$ . Factorizations of positive integers $n$ are related to $2$ -digit palindromes. That is, if $n$ can be factorized as $n=p\cdot q$ where $p\lt q-1$ , this means that $n$ is a $2$ -digit palindrome in the number base $q-1$ , which we write as: $$ n=p q=p(q-1)+p=(p, p)_{q-1}, p<q-1, $$ where $(p,p)$ are digits of $n=pq$ in the number base $q-1$ . Representing $n\in\mathbb N$ as a sum of $n\times n$ images (matrices) First we define a ""matrix of point"", then we define the ""sum"" of these matrices. Let $x_0,y_0$ be nonnegative integers. Let $P_n(x_0,y_0)$ be a $n$ by $n$ matrix ""of point $(x_0,y_0)$ "" whose top left entry is denoted with $P_n(x_0,y_0)(0,0)$ and whose bottom right entry is denoted with $P_n(x_0,y_0)(n-1,n-1)$ . It is defined for $x,y\in[0,n)$ as: $$ P_n(x_0,y_0)(x,y)= \begin{cases} 1, & \text{if }x+nx_0\text{ is a two digit palindrome in base }y+ny_0\\ 0, & \text{else} \end{cases} $$ We can visualize these ""point"" matrices as images by coloring different entries with different colors.  For example, "" $P_{100}(x_0,y_0)$ ""'s for $(x_0,x_0)=(0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(3,0)$ are: Where the green pixels represent the matrix entries that are $1$ . Notice that $P_n(x_0,y_0)$ in point $(x_0,y_0)=(0,0)$ contains ""dotted lines"" $L_t$ of points from $$\{(t^2-1+(t-1)r,t+r),t\ge 2, r\ge 0\}$$ and that if we look at $P_n(x_0,y_0)$ in some other point, we get continuations of these lines. Visualization of the ""image of $n$ "" matrix We define $N_n(y_0)=\sum\limits_{k=0}^{\infty} P_n(k,y_0)$ as ""entry-wise sum of $P_n$ 's along the $x$ -axis at level $y_0$ "". Notice that this sum always sums finitely many matrices because for large enough $k=x_0$ , all entries of the matrix are $0$ . To visualize $N_n(y_0)$ we will color all $0$ entries white, and all other entries blue. This visualization remains the same for all $y_0\ge 1$ except in the top left entry which is zero only for $y_0=1$ . If we choose $y_0=0$ , then the visualization is ""degenerated"". This motivates us to write $N_n=f(N_n(1))$ and call $N_n$ the ""image of $n$ "", where $f$ returns the same matrix but all nonzero entries are set to ""blue"" and all zero entries are set to ""white"". For example, below is the image showing the $N_n$ 's for $n=7,\dots,31$ . Notice that the prime numbers are solid blue squares with no additional details, and that other numbers have visualizations that correspond to their factorizations. Patterns in $N_n$ based on factorizations of $n$ For example, notice that even semi-primes $n=2p$ where $p$ is prime, all have the following look: Or for example, notice that squares of primes $n=p^2$ have the least details: On the other hand, numbers with a lot of factors such as factorials like $4!=2\cdot3\cdot4 = 24$ or primorials like $p_3\#=2\cdot 3\cdot 5 = 30$ have much more details (factors), and numbers such as powers of primes like $27=3^3$ and $32=2^5$ have regular fractal-like patterns. One might ask if we can for $n$ in general compute the matrix $N_n$ more efficiently than calculating and summing up all those $P_n$ 's. That is, is there an efficient test to get a $N_n(x,y)$ entry directly? $-$ This question does not need to be answered, it's just my thought on the current chapter. Inside prime visualizations The $N_p$ where $p$ is a prime number resembles a solid blue square and looks boring. But, we can ""look inside"" this solid blue square by replacing our $f$ function. Recall that we are WLOG observing $y_0=1$ because all $y_0\ge 1$ yield equivalent images. ""Heat-image"" matrix of prime number $p$ We will write $\overline{N}_p=h(N_p(1))$ and call $\overline{N}_p$ the ""heat-image of prime $p$ "", where $h$ assigns distinct colors to distinct values of entries of $N_p(1)$ and returns such matrix. Let the zero value be ""black"", the smallest nonzero value be ""red"" and the second-smallest nonzero value be ""yellow"". Other values can be ""white"" or represented in shades of ""grey"". For example, here are $\overline{N}_p$ 's of primes $p=101,103,109$ : At first glance these appear to be different sizes of the same image, but this is not the case. Within different $M_p$ 's we find different patterns in certain regions of the image. Thanks to Hyperplane's comment , we can ""enhance"" these regions by removing the needless details. That is, if we ignore the last row then these $\overline{N}_p$ 's appear to be symmetric along the central horizontal line. In other words, if an entry $(x,y)$ is red then the mirrored entry $(x,|p-y-2|)$ is yellow, and vice versa. However, this is not true for all entries. This motivates us to observe the ""non-mirrored"" entries, and set the other ones to $0$ . The pattern inside prime number $p$ We will observe the irregularities in the ""heat-image"". That is, we define a new matrix $M_p$ : $$ M_p(x,y)= \begin{cases} 1, & \text{if }N_p(1)(x,y) = N_p(1)(x,|p-y-2|)\\ 0, & \text{else} \end{cases} $$ We will represent these entries by coloring $1$ 's and $0$ 's with white and black, respectively. For example, here are $M_p$ 's of primes $p=101,103,109$ : Observe the white pixels near the central horizontal line. Notice that there we can distinguish between a ""thick dotted parabola"" and a ""thin dotted parabola"". For example, zooming into the central horizontal line of $109$ shows that the ""thick dotted parabola"" one is on the left side, and that the ""thin dotted parabola"" one is on the right side. It is the same for the prime $101$ , but not for the prime $103$ which has it the other way around. It turns out that primes of the form $p=4k+1$ are ""left-handed"" (have the ""thick"" parabola on the left side) and that the primes of the form $p=4k-1$ are ""right-handed"" (have the ""thick"" parabola on the right side). It also turns out that these are not the only ""parabolic"" groups of pixels that exist. I've tried tracing the prime $p=101$ from different groups of pixels and found a set of three distinct parabolas. Observe the last (fourth) image below. These have one of the following ""shapes"" of pixels at their ""head"": The first (""green parabola"") has $I_{2}$ - ""I shape of height of 2 pixels"" The second (""blue parabola"") has $J_{2,1}$ - ""J shape of height of $2+1$ pixels"" The third (""red parabola"") has $I_{3}$ - ""I shape of height of $3$ pixels"" Note that these ""shapes"" are mirrored below/above the central horizontal line. All $6$ permutations of these ""shapes"" can appear in some prime number $p$ (in some $M_p$ ). Depending on the permutation that appears in the image (the matrix), we can determine if the prime number is of form $p=18k+m$ where $m\in\{-1,1,5,7,11,13\}$ . For example, all primes of the form $p=18k+11$ have the same $(I_{2},J_{2,1},I_{3})$ permutation of these parabolic patterns as the prime $101=18\cdot 5+11$ , in that region of $M_p$ . The larger the prime $p$ , the more of these regions we can find. For example, in primes as large as $p=997$ I've highlighted four of these regions.  Some regions repeat multiple times. For example, notice that there are four instances of the yellow region highlighted. If the picture above isn't clear, we can alternatively color (highlight) the regions by connecting the pixels (entries) that represent (""belong to"") corresponding ""parabolic"" shapes: In every region $R$ , we can observe a set of ""parabolic"" shapes. Different permutations of those shapes will appear in different primes $p$ (in different $M_p$ 's), depending on the remainder $m$ from division of $p$ by some constant $c_R$ . The question is now, can we characterize every such region and its shapes? The pattern and the question I think I'm having a hard time characterizing all these regions, because I'm actually not sure how to properly define them. Essentially, it appears $M_p$ contains ""regions $R_s$ "" and within those regions we can find one of the possible permutations $P=(p^{(s)}_1,p^{(s)}_2,\dots,p^{(s)}_s)$ of $s$ ""parabolic shapes"". It seems that region $R_s$ contains some  permutation $P_m$ if and only if $p\equiv m\pmod{c_s}$ where $c_s$ is some constant related to the $s$ th region. Question. $1.$ Can we characterize all regions $R_s$ and their $P_m$ 's and $c_s$ ? The ""pattern inside a prime $p$ "" would be the collection of all regions $R_s$ of the matrix $M_p$ . Note that this is related to Moiré pattern's , as this user pointed out . Below are the regions I've observed so far. Characterization of regions $R_s$ for small $s$ I will be using $P=(1,2,\dots,s)$ as a shortened notation for $P=(p^{(s)}_1,p^{(s)}_2,\dots,p^{(s)}_s)$ . Also, the interpretation of this notation is that $p^{(s)}_1$ is in the leftmost part of the region, and that $p^{(s)}_s$ is in the rightmost part of the region. $$ (s=1) $$ In every $M_p$ , if you look either at the very top or at the very bottom, you will find the same ""half-parabola"" shape $p^{(1)}_1$ . This gives the trivial region: $$ R_1 : P=(1) \iff p \equiv 1\pmod{2} $$ That is, there is only one possible permutation within $R_1$ , and every prime $p$ has it. $$ (s=2) $$ Given a $M_p$ and looking around the central horizontal line we can find $2$ distinct parabolic shapes. These are the ""thick parabola"" $p^{(2)}_1$ and the ""thin parabola"" $p^{(2)}_2$ . I've observed that: $$\begin{align} R_2 : P=(1,2) &\iff p \equiv 1\pmod{4} \\ R_2 : P=(2,1) &\iff p \equiv 3\pmod{4} \\ \end{align}$$ This region splits the primes into two sets. $$ (s=3) $$ In the previous chapter we've observed $R_3$ to contain parabolic shapes characterized by a ""short I shape"" = $p^{(3)}_1$ , a ""long I shape"" = $p^{(3)}_2$ and a ""J shape"" = $p^{(3)}_3$ . It appears that: $$\begin{align} R_3 : P=(1,2,3) &\iff p \equiv 1\pmod{18} \\ R_3 : P=(2,1,3) &\iff p \equiv 5\pmod{18} \\ R_3 : P=(2,3,1) &\iff p \equiv 7\pmod{18} \\ R_3 : P=(1,3,2) &\iff p \equiv 11\pmod{18} \\ R_3 : P=(3,1,2) &\iff p \equiv 13\pmod{18} \\ R_3 : P=(3,2,1) &\iff p \equiv 17\pmod{18} \\ \end{align}$$ This region splits the primes into six sets. Unlike $R_2$ that appears only once, this $R_3$ region appears twice in the image: above and (mirrored) below the central horizontal line. $$ (s=4) $$ The region $R_4$ is similar to $R_3$ but of course has more permutations. This region contains parabolic shapes characterized by following shapes (groups of pixels): ""3 long pixels"" = $p^{(4)}_1$ , ""2 short pixels"" = $p^{(4)}_2$ , ""2 long pixels"" = $p^{(4)}_3$ and ""3 short pixels"" = $p^{(4)}_4$ . The corresponding congurences are: $$\begin{align} R_4 : P=(1,2,3,4) &\iff p \equiv 1\pmod{16} \\ R_4 : P=(1,4,3,2) &\iff p \equiv 3\pmod{16} \\ R_4 : P=(4,1,2,3) &\iff p \equiv 5\pmod{16} \\ R_4 : P=(2,1,4,3) &\iff p \equiv 7\pmod{16} \\ R_4 : P=(3,4,1,2) &\iff p \equiv 9\pmod{16} \\ R_4 : P=(3,2,1,4) &\iff p \equiv 11\pmod{16} \\ R_4 : P=(2,3,4,1) &\iff p \equiv 13\pmod{16} \\ R_4 : P=(4,3,2,1) &\iff p \equiv 15\pmod{16} \\ \end{align}$$ Interestingly, not all permutations of four shapes are possible to appear in this region. That is, we can see that only $8$ out of theoretical $24=4!$ appear. Also notice that we alternate even and odd numbers (""short"" and ""long"" shapes) in all of these permutations. $$ (s\ge 5) $$ Unexpectedly, unlike $R_3$ and $R_4$ that appear only once (on each mirrored side), we can say that the $R_5$ appears twice (on each mirrored side). But, in each of those two mirrored pairs we have different parabolic shapes. Therefore, we can also say that there are two different $R_5$ regions. So far, I've been manually tracing pixels in many consecutive primes to observe these regions and their permutations. Can we characterize these regions more efficiently? I've examined the $R_5$ region(s) and found that $c_5=50$ , which gives $20$ possible permutations. I've also examined $R_6$ and found $c_6=36$ , which gives $12$ possible permutations. Notice that a pattern emerges here. The $c_s $ appears to follow the sequence: $$ c_s=2, 4, 18, 16, 50, 36,\dots $$ Which corresponds to only one OEIS sequence, namely the A137933(s) = $c_s = \DeclareMathOperator{\lcm}{lcm}\lcm(s^2,2)$ . If this is true, then the number of possible permutations is $s\phi(s)$ , which is A002618. In other words, it appears that only the permutations (of ""parabolic"" shapes $\{1, 2, 3, \dots, s\}$ ) that are ""in arithmetic progressions modulo $s$ "" can exist within the $R_s$ region! Can we prove that this holds for all $s$ ? Beside finding how the individual parabolic shapes permute within corresponding regions, we also need to find their exact locations within those regions, to complete the characterization. Partition of pixels (entries) into regions $R_s$ An interesting question that we can ask is, can we color every pixel (entry) $(x,y)$ such that it belongs to exactly one (or two neighbouring) regions $R_s$ ? That is, $(x,y)$ should belong to a region if it is a part of a shape that is being permuted in that region, or if it ""extends"" one of those shapes up to the border of a neighbouring region. I've decided to color $R_1,R_2,R_3,R_4$ with $\color{purple}{\text{purple}},\color{red}{\text{red}},\color{green}{\text{green}},\color{blue}{\text{blue}}$ , respectively. I'll use white to color pixels that ""overlap"" (could be in either region) or those that ""are forming next region"". Prime numbers $p=2,3,5$ seem too small so we can start with $p=7,11,13,17,19,23$ . The first three regions are already visible in these small primes. Observing the next few primes $p=29,31,37,41$ , we see that the fourth region emerges too, but still intersects the third region at some parts. It is at primes $p=43,47,53$ when the fourth region should be clearly visible for the first time. The fifth region and beyond will appear at a bit larger primes. If we want to be able to color larger examples, we need to first characterize the regions (answer my first question) and then we need to be able to additionally determine their exact locations within the corresponding region. Question. $2.$ Can we determine locations for the parabolic shapes for given $R_s$ region? I've looked at $R_2$ (first nontrivial region), and it is not hard to see where exactly the two corresponding parabolic shapes will appear. This allowed me to come up with the parametrization of the entire pattern (matrix $M_p$ ) and is presented in the following chapter. Pattern parametrization The central region $R_2$ can be used to generate the entire matrix $M_p$ . This is much more efficient than computing it and might shed some light on the pattern. That is, all regions $R_s$ emerge from the following parametrization. Parametrization of $M_p$ To start, we locate the start (the ""head"") of the ""thin"" and the ""thick"" parabola. The starting $y$ will be given by $y=y_P$ for both, where the starting $x=x_L$ of the leftmost one and the starting $x=x_R$ of the rightmost one are: $$\begin{align} y_P&=\frac12(p-3)\\ x_L&=\frac14\left(p-(p\bmod{4})_{\in\{-1,1\}}\right)\\ x_R&=p-x_L \end{align}$$ where the ""mod"" takes values in $\{-1,1\}$ as noted. To generate $M_p$ , we start with a matrix of $0$ 's and fill in the $1$ 's with the following sequences, where the ""mod"" now takes nonnegative values: $$\begin{align} \left(x^{(i)}_n,y^{(i)}_n\right)&= \left( \left(\left(x^{(i)}_{n-1}+(2n-1)\right)\bmod{p}\right), y^{(i)}_{n-1}+1 \right), i\in\{1,2\},\\ \left(x^{(i)}_n,y^{(i)}_n\right)&= \left( \left(\left(x^{(i)}_{n-1}+(2n-1)\right)\bmod{p}\right), y^{(i)}_{n-1}-1 \right), i\in\{3,4\},\\ \left(x^{(5)}_n,y^{(5)}_n\right)&= \left( \left(\left(x^{(5)}_{n-1}+2n\right)\bmod{p}\right), y^{(5)}_{n-1}+1 \right),\\ \left(x^{(6)}_n,y^{(6)}_n\right)&= \left( \left(\left(x^{(6)}_{n-1}+2n\right)\bmod{p}\right), y^{(6)}_{n-1}-1 \right),\\ \end{align}$$ where the starting conditions are: $$\begin{align} \left(x^{(i)}_0,y^{(i)}_0\right)&=\left(x_a,y_P+(i\bmod{2})\right),i\in\{1,2,3,4\},\\ \left(x^{(i)}_0,y^{(i)}_0\right)&=\left(x_b,y_P+(i\bmod{2})\right),i\in\{5,6\},\\ \end{align}$$ where $x_a,x_b\in\{x_L,x_R\}$ are the $x$ 's of the ""head""'s of ""thick"",""thin"" parabolas, respectively. A sequence terminates after its $y$ coordinate leaves the $[0,p)$ interval. The only correction that needs to be done is that $M_p(0,0)=M_p(0,p-2)=M_p(0,p-1)=0$ and that $M_p(0,y)=1$ for $y=1,2,\dots,p-3$ . The rest of entries $M_p(x^{(i)}_n,y^{(i)}_n)=1$ are correctly generated by sequences $i=1,2,3,4,5,6$ and $n$ 's up until the $y$ escapes $[0,p)$ . These sequences represent extensions of the ""thick"" and ""thin"" parabolas from $R_2$ , that loop around the right and left edges of the image (matrix) up until the top (bottom). As these sequences intertwine, they will produce all other regions $R_s,s\ne 2$ . That is, all regions emerge from these sequences of pixels (entries). Can we use this to help us predict the characterizations of regions $R_s$ ?","Update I've observed a possible characterization and a possible parametrization of the pattern, and I've additionally rewritten the entire post with more details and better definitions. It remains to prove the observed possible characterization, and then complete it by finding the sequences for locations of the ""parabolic shapes"" that live in the characterized regions. Table of contents: Visualization of factorizations Inside prime visualizations The pattern and the question Pattern parametrization Visualization of factorizations Here I will explain how we can visualize positive integers in an interesting way which also has the property that the factorization of is encoded into it in the form of a fractal-like pattern. -digit palindromes represent factorizations We say that a positive integer is palindromic in some integer number base ( number-system ) if when written in that number base, its digits are read the same forward and backwards. The -digit palindrome is an integer , where in the notation, stand for digits of in the integer base . Factorizations of positive integers are related to -digit palindromes. That is, if can be factorized as where , this means that is a -digit palindrome in the number base , which we write as: where are digits of in the number base . Representing as a sum of images (matrices) First we define a ""matrix of point"", then we define the ""sum"" of these matrices. Let be nonnegative integers. Let be a by matrix ""of point "" whose top left entry is denoted with and whose bottom right entry is denoted with . It is defined for as: We can visualize these ""point"" matrices as images by coloring different entries with different colors.  For example, "" ""'s for are: Where the green pixels represent the matrix entries that are . Notice that in point contains ""dotted lines"" of points from and that if we look at in some other point, we get continuations of these lines. Visualization of the ""image of "" matrix We define as ""entry-wise sum of 's along the -axis at level "". Notice that this sum always sums finitely many matrices because for large enough , all entries of the matrix are . To visualize we will color all entries white, and all other entries blue. This visualization remains the same for all except in the top left entry which is zero only for . If we choose , then the visualization is ""degenerated"". This motivates us to write and call the ""image of "", where returns the same matrix but all nonzero entries are set to ""blue"" and all zero entries are set to ""white"". For example, below is the image showing the 's for . Notice that the prime numbers are solid blue squares with no additional details, and that other numbers have visualizations that correspond to their factorizations. Patterns in based on factorizations of For example, notice that even semi-primes where is prime, all have the following look: Or for example, notice that squares of primes have the least details: On the other hand, numbers with a lot of factors such as factorials like or primorials like have much more details (factors), and numbers such as powers of primes like and have regular fractal-like patterns. One might ask if we can for in general compute the matrix more efficiently than calculating and summing up all those 's. That is, is there an efficient test to get a entry directly? This question does not need to be answered, it's just my thought on the current chapter. Inside prime visualizations The where is a prime number resembles a solid blue square and looks boring. But, we can ""look inside"" this solid blue square by replacing our function. Recall that we are WLOG observing because all yield equivalent images. ""Heat-image"" matrix of prime number We will write and call the ""heat-image of prime "", where assigns distinct colors to distinct values of entries of and returns such matrix. Let the zero value be ""black"", the smallest nonzero value be ""red"" and the second-smallest nonzero value be ""yellow"". Other values can be ""white"" or represented in shades of ""grey"". For example, here are 's of primes : At first glance these appear to be different sizes of the same image, but this is not the case. Within different 's we find different patterns in certain regions of the image. Thanks to Hyperplane's comment , we can ""enhance"" these regions by removing the needless details. That is, if we ignore the last row then these 's appear to be symmetric along the central horizontal line. In other words, if an entry is red then the mirrored entry is yellow, and vice versa. However, this is not true for all entries. This motivates us to observe the ""non-mirrored"" entries, and set the other ones to . The pattern inside prime number We will observe the irregularities in the ""heat-image"". That is, we define a new matrix : We will represent these entries by coloring 's and 's with white and black, respectively. For example, here are 's of primes : Observe the white pixels near the central horizontal line. Notice that there we can distinguish between a ""thick dotted parabola"" and a ""thin dotted parabola"". For example, zooming into the central horizontal line of shows that the ""thick dotted parabola"" one is on the left side, and that the ""thin dotted parabola"" one is on the right side. It is the same for the prime , but not for the prime which has it the other way around. It turns out that primes of the form are ""left-handed"" (have the ""thick"" parabola on the left side) and that the primes of the form are ""right-handed"" (have the ""thick"" parabola on the right side). It also turns out that these are not the only ""parabolic"" groups of pixels that exist. I've tried tracing the prime from different groups of pixels and found a set of three distinct parabolas. Observe the last (fourth) image below. These have one of the following ""shapes"" of pixels at their ""head"": The first (""green parabola"") has - ""I shape of height of 2 pixels"" The second (""blue parabola"") has - ""J shape of height of pixels"" The third (""red parabola"") has - ""I shape of height of pixels"" Note that these ""shapes"" are mirrored below/above the central horizontal line. All permutations of these ""shapes"" can appear in some prime number (in some ). Depending on the permutation that appears in the image (the matrix), we can determine if the prime number is of form where . For example, all primes of the form have the same permutation of these parabolic patterns as the prime , in that region of . The larger the prime , the more of these regions we can find. For example, in primes as large as I've highlighted four of these regions.  Some regions repeat multiple times. For example, notice that there are four instances of the yellow region highlighted. If the picture above isn't clear, we can alternatively color (highlight) the regions by connecting the pixels (entries) that represent (""belong to"") corresponding ""parabolic"" shapes: In every region , we can observe a set of ""parabolic"" shapes. Different permutations of those shapes will appear in different primes (in different 's), depending on the remainder from division of by some constant . The question is now, can we characterize every such region and its shapes? The pattern and the question I think I'm having a hard time characterizing all these regions, because I'm actually not sure how to properly define them. Essentially, it appears contains ""regions "" and within those regions we can find one of the possible permutations of ""parabolic shapes"". It seems that region contains some  permutation if and only if where is some constant related to the th region. Question. Can we characterize all regions and their 's and ? The ""pattern inside a prime "" would be the collection of all regions of the matrix . Note that this is related to Moiré pattern's , as this user pointed out . Below are the regions I've observed so far. Characterization of regions for small I will be using as a shortened notation for . Also, the interpretation of this notation is that is in the leftmost part of the region, and that is in the rightmost part of the region. In every , if you look either at the very top or at the very bottom, you will find the same ""half-parabola"" shape . This gives the trivial region: That is, there is only one possible permutation within , and every prime has it. Given a and looking around the central horizontal line we can find distinct parabolic shapes. These are the ""thick parabola"" and the ""thin parabola"" . I've observed that: This region splits the primes into two sets. In the previous chapter we've observed to contain parabolic shapes characterized by a ""short I shape"" = , a ""long I shape"" = and a ""J shape"" = . It appears that: This region splits the primes into six sets. Unlike that appears only once, this region appears twice in the image: above and (mirrored) below the central horizontal line. The region is similar to but of course has more permutations. This region contains parabolic shapes characterized by following shapes (groups of pixels): ""3 long pixels"" = , ""2 short pixels"" = , ""2 long pixels"" = and ""3 short pixels"" = . The corresponding congurences are: Interestingly, not all permutations of four shapes are possible to appear in this region. That is, we can see that only out of theoretical appear. Also notice that we alternate even and odd numbers (""short"" and ""long"" shapes) in all of these permutations. Unexpectedly, unlike and that appear only once (on each mirrored side), we can say that the appears twice (on each mirrored side). But, in each of those two mirrored pairs we have different parabolic shapes. Therefore, we can also say that there are two different regions. So far, I've been manually tracing pixels in many consecutive primes to observe these regions and their permutations. Can we characterize these regions more efficiently? I've examined the region(s) and found that , which gives possible permutations. I've also examined and found , which gives possible permutations. Notice that a pattern emerges here. The appears to follow the sequence: Which corresponds to only one OEIS sequence, namely the A137933(s) = . If this is true, then the number of possible permutations is , which is A002618. In other words, it appears that only the permutations (of ""parabolic"" shapes ) that are ""in arithmetic progressions modulo "" can exist within the region! Can we prove that this holds for all ? Beside finding how the individual parabolic shapes permute within corresponding regions, we also need to find their exact locations within those regions, to complete the characterization. Partition of pixels (entries) into regions An interesting question that we can ask is, can we color every pixel (entry) such that it belongs to exactly one (or two neighbouring) regions ? That is, should belong to a region if it is a part of a shape that is being permuted in that region, or if it ""extends"" one of those shapes up to the border of a neighbouring region. I've decided to color with , respectively. I'll use white to color pixels that ""overlap"" (could be in either region) or those that ""are forming next region"". Prime numbers seem too small so we can start with . The first three regions are already visible in these small primes. Observing the next few primes , we see that the fourth region emerges too, but still intersects the third region at some parts. It is at primes when the fourth region should be clearly visible for the first time. The fifth region and beyond will appear at a bit larger primes. If we want to be able to color larger examples, we need to first characterize the regions (answer my first question) and then we need to be able to additionally determine their exact locations within the corresponding region. Question. Can we determine locations for the parabolic shapes for given region? I've looked at (first nontrivial region), and it is not hard to see where exactly the two corresponding parabolic shapes will appear. This allowed me to come up with the parametrization of the entire pattern (matrix ) and is presented in the following chapter. Pattern parametrization The central region can be used to generate the entire matrix . This is much more efficient than computing it and might shed some light on the pattern. That is, all regions emerge from the following parametrization. Parametrization of To start, we locate the start (the ""head"") of the ""thin"" and the ""thick"" parabola. The starting will be given by for both, where the starting of the leftmost one and the starting of the rightmost one are: where the ""mod"" takes values in as noted. To generate , we start with a matrix of 's and fill in the 's with the following sequences, where the ""mod"" now takes nonnegative values: where the starting conditions are: where are the 's of the ""head""'s of ""thick"",""thin"" parabolas, respectively. A sequence terminates after its coordinate leaves the interval. The only correction that needs to be done is that and that for . The rest of entries are correctly generated by sequences and 's up until the escapes . These sequences represent extensions of the ""thick"" and ""thin"" parabolas from , that loop around the right and left edges of the image (matrix) up until the top (bottom). As these sequences intertwine, they will produce all other regions . That is, all regions emerge from these sequences of pixels (entries).

86,Prime as sum of three numbers whose product is a cube,Prime as sum of three numbers whose product is a cube,,"Good evening!  I am very new to this site. I would like to put the following material from Prof. Gandhi's note book and my observations. Of course it is little long with more questions. But, with good belief on this site, I am sending for good solutions/answers. If we take other than primes $2$, $5$ and $11$, every prime can be written as $x + y + z$, where $x$, $y$ and $z$ are some positive numbers. Interestingly, $x \times y \times z = c^3$, where $c$ is again some positive number. Let us see the magic for primes $3,7,13,31,43,73$ $$ \begin{align} 3 = 1 + 1 + 1 &\Longrightarrow 1 \times 1 \times 1 =  1^3\\ 7 = 1 + 2 + 4 &\Longrightarrow  1 \times 2 \times 4 = 2^3\\ 13 = 1 + 3 + 9 &\Longrightarrow 1 \times 3 \times 9 = 3^3\\ 31 = 1 + 5 + 25 &\Longrightarrow 1 \times 5 \times 25 = 5^3\\ 43 = 1 + 6 + 36 &\Longrightarrow 1 \times 6 \times 36 = 6^3\\ 73 = 1 + 8 + 64 &\Longrightarrow 1 \times 8 \times 64 = 8^3\\ \end{align} $$ Can you justify the above pattern?  How to generalize the above statement either mathematically or by computer? But, I observed that it is true for primes less than $9500$. Can your provide a computational algorithm to describe this?

Thank you so much. edit Concerning this cubic property : Notice that this can be extended to hold for almost all squarefree positive integers $> 2$, not just the primes. for instance :  we know for the prime $7$ : $7=1+2+4$ so we also get $7A = 1A + 2A + 4A$ and $1A * 2A * 4A$ is simply equal to $8A^3$. In fact this can be extended to all odd positive integers $>11$ if $25,121$ have a solution. Hence I am intrested in this and I placed a bounty. I edited the question because its to much for a comment and certainly not an answer. Btw Im curious about this Ghandi person though info about that does not get the bounty naturally. I would like to remind David Speyer's comment : Every prime that is $1 mod 3$  is of the form $a^ 2 +ab+b^ 2$  , so that covers half the primes immediately. So that might be a line of attack.","Good evening!  I am very new to this site. I would like to put the following material from Prof. Gandhi's note book and my observations. Of course it is little long with more questions. But, with good belief on this site, I am sending for good solutions/answers. If we take other than primes $2$, $5$ and $11$, every prime can be written as $x + y + z$, where $x$, $y$ and $z$ are some positive numbers. Interestingly, $x \times y \times z = c^3$, where $c$ is again some positive number. Let us see the magic for primes $3,7,13,31,43,73$ $$ \begin{align} 3 = 1 + 1 + 1 &\Longrightarrow 1 \times 1 \times 1 =  1^3\\ 7 = 1 + 2 + 4 &\Longrightarrow  1 \times 2 \times 4 = 2^3\\ 13 = 1 + 3 + 9 &\Longrightarrow 1 \times 3 \times 9 = 3^3\\ 31 = 1 + 5 + 25 &\Longrightarrow 1 \times 5 \times 25 = 5^3\\ 43 = 1 + 6 + 36 &\Longrightarrow 1 \times 6 \times 36 = 6^3\\ 73 = 1 + 8 + 64 &\Longrightarrow 1 \times 8 \times 64 = 8^3\\ \end{align} $$ Can you justify the above pattern?  How to generalize the above statement either mathematically or by computer? But, I observed that it is true for primes less than $9500$. Can your provide a computational algorithm to describe this? Also, prove that, we conjecture that except $1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 22, 23$, every positive number can be written as a sum of four positive numbers and the product is again can be expressible in 4th power.

90,Generalizing Ramanujan's proof of Bertrand's Postulate: Can Ramanujan's approach be used to show a prime between $4x$ and $5x$ for $x \ge 3$,Generalizing Ramanujan's proof of Bertrand's Postulate: Can Ramanujan's approach be used to show a prime between  and  for,4x 5x x \ge 3,"Perhaps, I've been thinking too long about Ramanujan's proof , but it appears to me that his argument can be generalized beyond $x$ and $2x$ .  My argument below attempts to show that for $x \ge 1331$ , there is always a prime between $4x$ and $5x$ . I can use a similar argument to establish there is a prime between $2x$ and $3x$ and between $3x$ and $4x$ .  Based on some rough estimates, it looks it should also work to prove a prime between $5x$ and $6x$ as well as a prime between $6x$ and $7x$ . Since I am still getting up to speed on analytic number theory, I will be very glad if someone can point out the mistake that I am making in my reasoning.  I am not yet able to find it. Let $$\vartheta(x) = \sum_{p \le x}\ln(p)$$ Let $$\psi(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\vartheta(x^{\frac{1}{n}})$$ Following Ramanujan [see (6)]: $$\psi(x) - 2\psi(\sqrt{x}) \le \vartheta(x) \le \psi(x)$$ Analogous to Ramanujan's statement about: $$\ln(\lfloor{x}\rfloor]!) - \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{2}\rfloor!) - \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{2}\rfloor!) = \psi(x) - \psi(\frac{x}{2}) + \psi(\frac{x}{3}) - \psi(\frac{x}{4}) + \ldots$$ Here's my restatement in terms of $4x$ and $5x$ : $$\ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{4}\rfloor!) - \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{5}\rfloor!) - \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{20}\rfloor!) = \psi(\frac{x}{4}) - \psi(\frac{x}{5}) + \psi(\frac{x}{8}) - \psi(\frac{x}{10}) + \ldots$$ where for each successive term we can see: $$\psi(\frac{x}{4}) \ge \psi(\frac{x}{5}) \ge \psi(\frac{x}{8}) \ge \psi(\frac{x}{10}) \ge  \ldots$$ Since, for any integer $v \ge 1$ , we have: $$\psi(\frac{x}{20v+4}) - \psi(\frac{x}{20v+5}) + \psi(\frac{x}{20v+8})-\psi(\frac{x}{20v+10})+\psi(\frac{x}{20v+12}) -\psi(\frac{x}{20v+15}) + \psi(\frac{x}{20v+16}) - \psi(\frac{x}{20v+20}) + \ldots$$ That is, a decreasing sequence of real numbers tending to 0, where each successive term has an alternating sign. So, based on reasoning found here , it follows: $$\psi(\frac{x}{4}) - \psi(\frac{x}{5}) + \psi(\frac{x}{8}) - \psi(\frac{x}{10}) + \psi(\frac{x}{12}) \ge \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{4}\rfloor!) - \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{5}\rfloor!) -\ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{20}\rfloor!)$$ From $\psi(x) - 2\psi(\sqrt{x}) \le \vartheta(x) \le \psi(x)$ , it follows that: $$\psi(\frac{x}{4}) - \psi(\frac{x}{5}) + \psi(\frac{x}{8}) - \psi(\frac{x}{10}) + \psi(\frac{x}{12}) \le \vartheta(\frac{x}{4}) - \vartheta(\frac{x}{5}) + 2\psi(\sqrt{\frac{x}{4}}) + \psi(\frac{x}{8}) - \psi(\frac{x}{10}) + \psi(\frac{x}{12})$$ Using the same reasoning as above, it can be noted that: $$\psi(\frac{x}{10}) - \psi(\frac{x}{12}) \le \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{10}\rfloor!) - \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{12}\rfloor!) - \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{60}\rfloor!)$$ So that we have: $$\psi(\frac{x}{4}) - \psi(\frac{x}{5}) + \psi(\frac{x}{8}) - \psi(\frac{x}{10}) + \psi(\frac{x}{12}) \le \vartheta(\frac{x}{4}) - \vartheta(\frac{x}{5}) + 2\psi(\sqrt{\frac{x}{4}}) + \psi(\frac{x}{8}) - [ \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{10}\rfloor!) - \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{12}\rfloor!) - \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{60}\rfloor!) ]$$ which implies: $$\vartheta(\frac{x}{4}) - \vartheta(\frac{x}{5}) \ge \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{4}\rfloor!) - \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{5}\rfloor!) -\ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{20}\rfloor!) - 2\psi(\sqrt{\frac{x}{4}}) - \psi(\frac{x}{8}) + \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{10}\rfloor!) - \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{12}\rfloor!) - \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{60}\rfloor!)$$ From Rosser and Schoenfeld (1961) , we know that (see Theorem 12): $$\psi(x) < 1.03883x$$ So that: $$\vartheta(\frac{x}{4}) - \vartheta(\frac{x}{5}) \ge \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{4}\rfloor!) - \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{5}\rfloor!) -\ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{20}\rfloor!) - 2(1.03883)(\sqrt{\frac{x}{4}}) - (1.03883)(\frac{x}{8}) + \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{10}\rfloor!) - \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{12}\rfloor!) - \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{60}\rfloor!)$$ Based on Stirling's Approximation and my reasoning found here , it follows that $\vartheta(\frac{x}{4}) - \vartheta(\frac{x}{5}) > 0$ for $x \ge 1331$ I have also verified that for $1331 > x > 2$ , there is always a prime between $5x$ and $4x$ so if my argument is valid, this would be enough to establish that there is always a prime between $5x$ and $4x$ for $x \ge 3$ .

94,Fractals using just modulo operation,Fractals using just modulo operation,,"Let us calculate the remainder after division of $27$ by $10$. $27 \equiv 7 \pmod{10}$ We have $7$. So let's calculate the remainder after divison of $27$ by $7$. $ 27 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}$ Ok, so let us continue with $6$ as the divisor... $ 27 \equiv 3 \pmod{6}$ Getting closer... $ 27 \equiv 0 \pmod{3}$ Good! We have finally reached $0$ which means we are unable to continue the procedure. Let's make a function that counts the modulo operations we need to perform until we finally arrive at $0$. So we find some remainder $r_{1}$ after division of some $a$ by some $b$, then we find some remainder $r_{2}$ after division of $a$ by $r_{1}$ and we repeat the procedure until we find such index $i$ that $r_{i} = 0$. Therefore, let $$ M(a, b) = i-1$$ for $a, b \in \mathbb{N}, b \neq 0 $ (I like to call it ""modulity of a by b"", thence M ) For our example: $M(27, 10) = 3$. Notice that $M(a, b) = 0 \Leftrightarrow  b|a $ (this is why $i-1$ feels nicer to me than just $i$) Recall what happens if we put a white pixel at such $(x, y)$ that $y|x$: This is also the plot of $M(x, y) = 0$. (the image is reflected over x and y axes for aesthetic reasons. $(0, 0)$ is exactly in the center) What we see here is the common divisor plot that's already been studied extensively by prime number researchers. Now here's where things start getting interesting: What if we put a pixel at such $(x, y)$ that $M(x, y) = 1$? Looks almost like the divisor plot ... but get a closer look at the rays. It's like copies of the divisor plot are growing on each of the original line! How about $M(x, y) = 2$? Copies are growing on the copies! Note that I do not overlay any of the images, I just follow this single equation. Now here is my favorite. Let us determine luminosity ($0 - 255$) of a pixel at $(x, y)$ by the following equation: $$255 \over{ M(x,y) + 1 }$$ (it is therefore full white whenever $y$ divides $x$, half-white if $M(x, y) = 1$ and so on) The full resolution version is around ~35 mb so I couldn't upload it here  (I totally recommend seeing this in 1:1): https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_gBQSJQBKcjakVSZG1KUVVoTmM/view?usp=sharing What strikes me the most is that some black stripes appear in the gray area and they most often represent prime number locations.

For comparison, plot of $x$ mod $11$ (1:1 scale): https://i.sstatic.net/viKAU.png As it's been pointed out in the comments, subsequent iterations of $M(a, b)$ look very much like Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisors using repeated modulo.

Somebody even drew a density plot here on stackexchange . The primes, however, are not so clearly visible in GCD plots . Overall, they seem more orderly and stripes do not align vertically like they do when we use $M(a, b)$ instead. Here's a convenient comparative animation between GCD timer (complexity plot) and my Modulity function ($M(x, y)$). Best viewed in 1:1 zoom. $M(x, y)$ appears to be different in nature from Euclid's GCD algorithm. Questions Where is $M(a, b)$ used in mathematics? Is it already named somehow?
