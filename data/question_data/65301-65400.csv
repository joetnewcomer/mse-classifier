14,Is there a natural bijective proof of the identity $(2^i)^j = (2^j)^i$?,Is there a natural bijective proof of the identity ?,(2^i)^j = (2^j)^i,"As is well-known, iterating exponentials is a commutative operation. Assuming that $i$ and $j$ are positive integers, one way to view the integer $2^i$ is as the cardinality of the power set $2^{\{ 1 , \dots , i \}}$ (and likewise for $2^j$ ). The equality $(2^i)^j = (2^j)^i$ implies that the sets $(2^{\{ 1 , \dots , i \}})^{\times j}$ (this means take the Cartesian product with itself $j$ times) and $(2^{\{ 1 , \dots , j \} })^{\times i}$ are in bijection with each other. My question is the following: is there a natural choice of bijection between these two sets that implies the equality $(2^i)^j = (2^j)^i$ ? Just as an example: we know that $(2^1)^2 = (2^2)^1$ . Enumerating $(2^{\{ 1 \} })^2$ and $2^{\{1,2 \}}$ , the most natural correspondence between these two sets seems to be the following: $$(\varnothing , \varnothing) \leftrightarrow \varnothing,$$ $$(\{ 1 \} , \varnothing) \leftrightarrow \{1 \},$$ $$( \varnothing , \{ 1 \} ) \leftrightarrow \{ 2 \},$$ $$(\{ 1 \} , \{ 1 \}) \leftrightarrow \{ 1 , 2 \}.$$ It seems then that one way to make this task a little easier is to take advantage of the Boolean poset structure, since the product of ranked posets remains a ranked poset. This means we really reduce the problem to finding a bijection between elements of the same rank in the corresponding posets... in any case, I assume that this bijection is considered standard, I just don't know what it should be. Edit : In view of the answers below, it seems that the correct way to do this naturally is to identify the power set $2^S$ with $\{ 0 , 1 \}^{S} := \operatorname{Hom} (S , \{ 0 ,1 \})$ (in the category of sets), then use the naturality of the bijection $(A^B)^C = A^{B \times C} = (A^C)^B$ . Following this bijection along explicitly, this corresponds to ``repacking"" your brackets. What I mean by this is the following: let $(\{1 \} , \{ 2 \} , \{ 1,2 \} ) \subset (2^{\{ 1 , 2 \}})^3$ . We know that this should correspond to a tuple $(2^{1,2,3})^2$ .

So, I tried using the multiplication theorem to get to an answer, Assuming ABCDE are seated along a line in the given order, A can get any of the three colors, following which B gets one of the two remaining colors, following C gets one of the two colors other than the one that B gets, and so on. So, the number of distributions would be Now this includes distributions in which A and E have the same colored hats, If A and E have the same colors, then there are 6 possible distributions which satisfy the conditions, 2 for each color that A gets. Using the inclusion-exclusion principle, But the answer is supposed to be 30. I'm not sure where I am wrong, so if someone could figure it out and help me solve this question, I'd be really grateful. This is my first time on this forum so excuse me if my question is not very clear.
