0,Proving two graphs are isomorphic assuming no knowledge on paths and degrees,Proving two graphs are isomorphic assuming no knowledge on paths and degrees,,"I was requested to show the following graphs are not isomorphic. I started studying graph theory literally half an hour ago, and I'm supposed to be able to show this without any knowledge of degrees and paths (since this problem comes immediately after defifining what a graph is, what an isomorphism is, and what a subgraph is). I had to use a totally intuitive conception of paths to find a way to prove this. Again, I have zero formal knowledge on paths so my notation, terminology, etc., might be quite off. However, I'm mostly concerned with whether I'm understanding the core ideas of subgraphs and isomorphisms right. Here's the answer as I wrote it. $\text{Answer.}$ Observation . There exists at least a subgraph $G'_1$ of $G_1$ with a $3-$ element subset $V_1'$ of $V_1$ such that $v'_i$ exists in two different edges $e_k, e_j \in E'_1$ . Note. This is my brute way of saying that in $G_1$ one can start at a point $v_i$ with the possibility of returning to it following a path of $3$ vertices. No such subgraph $G'_2 \subset G_2$ satisfies this same property. Trying to mean: it is impossible to return to any initial $v_i \in V_2$ through a path of $3$ vertices (one must take at least a $4$ -vertices path). Answer . We know (I skip the theorem) any isomorphism $\alpha$ between two graphs will map a subgraph to an isomorphic subgraph. However, the previous observation shows there are $3-$ element subgraphs of $G_1$ that can not be appropriately mapped to an isomorphic subgraph of $G_2$ . Then the graphs are not isomorphic. $\text{Side note}$ . I alternatively considered to state that there are subgraphs of $3$ elements of $G_1$ that have $3$ edges, with no subgraphs of $3$ elements of $G_2$ satisfying that property. But it seemed like I was saying the same thing in different words.

6,"find the maximum possible product of two positive integers whose digits form a permutation of $\{1,\cdots, 8\}$",find the maximum possible product of two positive integers whose digits form a permutation of,"\{1,\cdots, 8\}","What is the maximum possible value of a product of two numbers that use the digits $1,\cdots, 8$ exactly once and no other digits? I know how to obtain the minimum possible product. Similar to above, we must have that both numbers have digits in ascending order. Let $10b + c$ and $a$ be the two numbers, where $c$ is a digit. Then if $10b+c < a, $ since $(10b+c)a > (10a+c)b,$ moving the last digit from the smaller number results in a smaller number. Hence the smallest product is obtained when one number has one digit, which implies the other has 7 (otherwise we could decrease the product with the above method). First note that for the largest possible product, the two numbers must have their digits in descending order. We have 256 * 2519 > 2569 * 251, so it is not generally true that removing the last digit from the larger factor and appending it to the smaller one yields a larger product. Or if we want to satisfy the conditions of the problem we also have the example 253 * 1468 > 2538 * 146. For simplicity, consider the case where the two numbers have four digits. Then one number must have 8 as the first digit. The other number can't have 5 as the first digit (the largest digit) as then the maximum product would be $8761\cdot 5432 < 8321 \cdot 7654 = 63688934.$ So the second number must have $6$ or $7$ as the first digit. Then note that $\overline{87pq} \cdot \overline{6mcd} < \overline{8mrs}\cdot \overline{67pq} < \overline{8mrs}\cdot \overline{76pq},$ where the variables are digits. For instance, $\overline{87pq} \cdot \overline{6mcd} - \overline{8mrs}\cdot \overline{67pq} =(8700+10p+q)(6000+100m+10c+d)-(8000+100m+10r+s)(6700+10p+q),$ and a tedious calculation yields the desired inequality.","What is the maximum possible value of a product of two numbers that use the digits exactly once and no other digits?

To prove this theorem we need the following two technical lemmas. Lemma 1 (Large bipartite subgraph) Every $G$ has a bipartite subgraph with at least $e(G)/2$ edges. Lemma 2 (Large average degree implies subgraph with large minimum degree) Let $t>0$ . Every graph with average degree $2t$ has a subgraph with minimum degree greater than $t$ . Proof of Theorem. Suppose that the graph $G$ is the maximizer, i.e. $\text{ex}(n,\{C_4,\dots,C_{2k}\})=e(G)$ . Applying Lemma 1, we find a bipartite subgraph $G'$ of $G$ such that $e(G')\geq \dfrac{e(G)}{2}$ . Now applying Lemma 2, we find a subgraph $G''$ of $G'$ such that $$\delta(G'')>\underbrace{\dfrac{d_{\text{ave}}(G')}{2}}_{=t}=\dfrac{e(G')}{\nu(G')}\geq\dfrac{e(G)}{2\nu(G)}.$$ Notice that $G''$ is a bipartite subgraph of $G'$ (and hence of $G$ ) with $\delta(G'')>t\geq\dfrac{e(G)}{2\nu(G)}$ . Let $u$ be an arbitrary vertex of $G''$ . For each $i=0,1,\dots,k$ , let $A_i$ denote the set of vertices at distance exactly $i$ from $u$ . For each $i=1,\dots,k-1$ , every vertex of $A_i$ has: no neighbors in $A_i$ (or else $G''$ would not be bipartite), exactly one neighbor in $A_{i-1}$ (else we can backtrace through two neighbours which must converge at some point to form an even cycle of length at most $2k$ ), and thus $>t-1$ neighbors in $A_{i+1}$ (by the minimum degree assumption on $G''$ ). Therefore, each layer $A_i$ expands to the next by a factor at least $t-1$ . Hence $$\nu(G)\geq |A_k|\geq (t-1)^k\geq \left(\frac{e(G)}{2\nu(G)}-1\right)^k.$$ And thus $$e(G)\leq 2\nu(G)^{1+1/k}+2\nu(G).$$ I understand the idea of the proof but there are some technical moments which I did not understand: Questions.

A complete labelling is a way of assigning to each edge in $K_{n,n}$ a distinct (unordered) pair of integers $\{p,q\}$ where $1 \leq p,q \leq 2n$ , such that for each vertex the labels of edges incident to it include each of the integers from $1$ to $2n$ . Loosely, each vertex can 'see' every number in its adjoining edges. Question: For which $n$ does a complete labelling exist? Observations: It's vacuously possible for $n=1$ and impossible for $n=2$ as quickly one can see we are required to repeat a label. Since the number of possible labels is ${2n\choose 2}= 2n^2-n$ and there are $n^2$ edges, it's possible there'll always be 'enough' labels to reliably obtain a complete labelling. There are some 'obvious' implicit rules or alternative interpretations: Each integer must appear exactly $n$ times across all labels. Grouping vertices by 'connected to an edge labelled with $k$ ' partitions the vertices into disjoint pairs.

20,"An undirected graph is partitioned. For every partition $V_1 \cup V_2 = V$, $v_1 \in V_1$ is connected to some $v_2 \in V_2$. Show it is connected.","An undirected graph is partitioned. For every partition ,  is connected to some . Show it is connected.",V_1 \cup V_2 = V v_1 \in V_1 v_2 \in V_2,"We have an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ partitioned into two non-empty subsets $V_1 \cup V_2 = V$ . For this graph it holds that $(V_1 \cup V_2 = V) \implies (\exists v_1, v_2 : v_1 \in V_1 \land v_2 \in V_2 \land (v_1,v_2) \in E)$ . So for every partition some $v_1 \in V_1$ is connected to some $v_2 \in V_2$ . We need to show $G$ is connected, i.e.: to show that there is a path between any two elements in the graph. This problem came from a problem set in a course on discrete mathematics. I solved the problem in two ways. One being by contradiction. Namely by assuming that the graph is not connected, then there exists a partition $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$ such that no edge $(v_{1}, v_{2})$ exists with $v_{1} \in V_{1}$ and $v_{2} \in V_{2}$ which means the assumption that the graph is not connected is false. And so the graph must be connected. The other approach I came up with is based on induction and I would like to put this approach up to scrutiny. In this approach I incorporate the definition that for all partitions there is a $v_1 \in V_1$ and $v_2 \in V_2$ with $(v_1, v_2) \in E$ in an induction hypothesis. The induction hypothesis (IH) $P(n)$ being that ""for any partition $V_1$ with $n$ elements these elements are part of an induced (sub)graph $G[V_1]$ which is connected and there exists a $v_1 \in V_1$ and $v_2 \in V_2$ with $(v_1, v_2) \in E$ "". $G[V_x]$ is the induced subgraph of $G$ with elements in $V_x$ . Since the partitions are defined to be non-empty the base case contains one element. Applying the induction hypothesis to the base case $P(1)$ one gets ""for any partition $V_1$ with 1 element this element is part of an induced (sub)graph $G[V_1]$ which is connected and there exists a $v_1 \in V_1$ and $v_2 \in V_2$ with $(v_1, v_2) \in E$ "", which is true since any graph of one element is trivially connected and furthermore by definition this element is connected to some element $v_2 \in V_2$ . So there exists no element which is not connected to some other element, i.e.: every element in $V$ is connected to some other element in $V$ . Since we have added $(v_1, v_2)$ to a connected $G[V_1]$ we get that $G[V_1 \cup v_2]$ is connected. By definition the induced subgraphs consisting of two elements in $V_1$ are connected to some element $v_2 \in V_2$ . And so $P(1) \implies P(2) $ . Generalising we get that $P(n) = $ ""for any partition $V_1$ with $n$ elements these elements are part of an induced (sub)graph $G[V_1]$ which is connected and there exists a $v_1 \in V_1$ and $v_2 \in V_2$ with $(v_1, v_2) \in E$ "", which implies that every induced subgraph $G[V_1 \cup v_2] = (V_1 \cup {v_2}, E_1 \cup (v_1, v_2))$ of $G$ with $n + 1$ elements is connected and furthermore by IH these subgraphs contain some element connected to some element in $G[V_2 \setminus v_2]$ . And so $P(n) \implies P(n + 1)$ . And now we have that $P(1)$ and $P(n) \implies P(n + 1)$ and so $P(n)$ holds for all $n \leq \#V - 1$ (since partitions are non-empty). To finish things off we consider $P(m - 1)$ with $m = \#V$ . We have shown that all induced subgraphs $(V_1, E_1)$ of $G$ of size $m - 1$ are connected and by IH there is some element in this subgraph connected to an element in $V \setminus V_1$ . There is only one element left and since this element is connected to a connected subgraph the graph $G$ is connected. I can't find anything wrong with this reasoning but I'm not certain it's correct either. If anyone can point out something wrong with this, or provide a better induction hypothesis or something of that nature it would be much appreciated :).","We have an undirected graph partitioned into two non-empty subsets .

(You may first jump over the original problem below and take a glance at my toy example .) 1. Problem: Given a sequence length value $T\in\mathbb{N}$ , a threshold $K\in\mathbb{N}$ and target summation $S\in\mathbb{N}$ , an N-dimensional vector sequence $\{\mathbf{v}_t\}_{t=0}^{T}$ is produced by: The first item $\mathbf{v}_0\in\mathbb{R}^N$ is given by random generation. All its elements are non-negative and their summation is a non-negative integer denoted by $S\in\mathbb{N}$ that satisfies: $0\le S\le KN$ ; The subsequent items is produced by the following steps (procedure): $~~~~~~~$ (1) Initialize $\mathbf{v}_t:=\mathbf{v}_{t-1}$ ; $~~~~~~~$ (2) Calculate the average error between the element summation and $S$ , i.e., let $\delta_t:=\text{average}(\mathbf{v}_t)-(S/N)$ ; $~~~~~~~$ (3) Force the summation of its all elements to be $S$ , i.e., $\mathbf{v}_t:=\mathbf{v}_t-\delta_t$ , here each element of $\mathbf{v}_t$ is reduced by $\delta_t$ ; $~~~~~~~$ (4) Force all elements to be integers in $[0,K]$ , i.e., $\mathbf{v}_t:=\text{round}(\text{clip}_{0,K}(\mathbf{v}_t))$ , where $\text{round}(\cdot)$ and $\text{clip}_{0,K}(\cdot)$ are element-wise operator, they calculate the new vector element values dimension-by-dimension. The complete recurrence formula should be: $$ \mathbf{v}_t:=\text{round}(\text{clip}_{0,K}(\mathbf{v}_{t-1}-[\text{average}(\mathbf{v}_{t-1})-(S/N)])). $$ Is $\{\mathbf{v}_t\}_{t=0}^{T}$ convergent or not when $T\rightarrow\infty$ ? (Some above expressions may be informal but do not affect the meaning of this problem) There is a toy example (created by myself) that may be helpful to understand the original problem: 2. My Example (may be a little weird but not impactive): I have three children ( $N=3$ ) and ten stamps ( $S=10$ ). My children weigh $90$ kg, $6$ kg and $4$ kg (the first one may be a teenager and the latter two may be little baby boys), respectively, so at the beginning, I want to give them $9$ , $0.6$ and $0.4$ stamps, respectively. But there are three constrains. Firstly, I think a child can not have more than four stamps ( $K=4$ ). Secondly, the stamps can only be given one-by-one and one single stamp can not be cut, divided or shared (the stamps given to each child must be with a non-negative integer number). Thirdly, I only have ten stamps in total, and I want to try my best to distribute them all (the summation of all elements should be $S$ or close to $S$ ). So I perform the above mentioned procedure as follows: $~~~~~~~$ (1) I initialize the stamp number vector: $(9, 0.6, 0.4)$ ; First round: $~~~~~~~$ (2) I calculate the average error $\delta$ , and found that it is zero; $~~~~~~~$ (3) I clip each element into $[0,4]$ and round them, then I get: $(4, 1, 0)$ ; Second round: $~~~~~~~$ (4) I calculate the average error $\delta=(5-10)/3=-1.67$ ; $~~~~~~~$ (5) I correct the stamp number vector: $(4, 1, 0)-(-1.67)=(5.67,2.67,1.67)$ ; $~~~~~~~$ (6) I clip each element into $[0,4]$ and round them, then I get: $(4, 3, 2)$ ; Third round: $~~~~~~~$ (7) I calculate the average error $\delta=(9-10)/3=-0.33$ ; $~~~~~~~$ (8) I correct the stamp number vector: $(4, 3, 2)-(-0.33)=(4.33,3.33,2.33)$ ; $~~~~~~~$ (9) I clip each element into $[0,4]$ and round them, then I get: $(4, 3, 2)$ . I find that the stamp vector sequence is converged, so I stop, give the children four, three and two stamps, respectively, and keep one stamp. 3. My Efforts (may be not a correct idea): I'm trying to prove that the average error sequence $\{\delta_t\}$ is absolutely convergent, i.e., I was trying to show that: $$ 0\le |\delta_{t}|\le|\delta_{t-1}|, $$ but I was failed. And I think if $\{\delta_t\}$ is convergent, we can not say that $\{\mathbf{v}_t\}$ is convergent. May be I need to prove that $\{\delta_t\}$ is convergent to zero? However, I empirically find that $\{|\delta_t|\}$ may only be convergent to a non-negative number in most cases (please see below). Nevertheless, I simulated the absolute average error sequence $\{|\delta_t|\}$ by a toy Python program and observed that $\{|\delta_t|\}$ may be convergent: import numpy as np from matplotlib import pyplot as plt  N = 100  # vector dimension T = 30  # max sequence length S = 51200  # target sum of vector elements K = 1024  # max value of each element  for _ in range(1000):  # 1000 test instances     v = np.random.rand(N)  # uniformly distributed random vector     v = (v / np.sum(v)) * S  # normalize to make the element sum be S     abs_delta_list = []  # all absolute values of deltas     for t in range(T + 1):  # t = 0, 1, 2, ..., T         delta = np.mean(v) - (S / N)  # average error         v -= delta  # force the sum to be S         v = np.round(np.clip(v, 0, K))  # force all elements to be intergers in [0, K]         abs_delta_list.append(np.abs(delta))  # collect abs(delta)     plt.plot(abs_delta_list, color='blue')  # plot curve  plt.xlabel('t') plt.ylabel('abs(delta)') plt.savefig('abs_delta.png', dpi=600) I obtained: $(N=100, T=30, S=5120, K=1024)$ $(N=10, T=30, S=5120, K=1024)$ (Obviously, $\delta_1$ is zero). 4.

35,Lower bound on the cardinality of $\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i$,Lower bound on the cardinality of,\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i,"Question: Suppose I have $n$ finite sets $A_1,\dots,A_n$ contained in some fixed set $S$ , and I am given non-negative integers $N$ and $N_1,\dots,N_n$ such that each $A_i$ has cardinality $N$ , and each $k$ -tuple intersection has cardinality $\leq N_k$ . Can I use this to construct a good lower bound on the cardinality of $\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i$ ? Answer by Tim Gowers: I don't know your reason for asking this question, so it's unlikely that what I'm about to write will be helpful. Nevertheless, there's an easy method I like a lot for deducing a lower bound just from the knowledge that $N_2$ is small. It may be contained in what has been said above -- I haven't checked. The idea is to think of each set $A_i$ as a $01$ -valued function on a set of size $M$ . We then look at the $\ell_ 2$ norm of $\sum_i A_i$ . The square of the $\ell_ 2$ norm is $\sum_ {i,j}|A_ i \cap A_ j|$ , which by assumption is at most $nN + n(n-1)N_2$ . But we also have a lower bound: the $\ell_ 1$ norm of the sum is $nN$ , from which it follows that the square of the $\ell_2$ norm is at least $(nN)^2/M$ . Putting these two bits of information together gives a lower bound for $M$ of $nN/(1+(n-1)N_2/N)$ . So, for example, if $N_ 2 = cN$ for some smallish positive constant $c$ , then the lower bound is roughly $N/c$ . This question has been asked in MathOverflow many years ago and really good answer has been given by professor Tim Gowers but some moments of his answer are unclear.

For example : A1,A2, B2, D = (1 : 2.5), E = (6.1 : 7, 8.1 : 9.2) might have a cost of ""7.1"" and A1,A3, B1, C = C1 D = (1 - 8), E = (5.1 - 5.5) might have a cost of ""8.773"". For this ""game"", here are the rules: There are 3 players. The first player chooses some items from some of these 5 baskets. If the first player wanted, the first player could pick everything and leave the other 2 players with nothing. The first player also has the choice of ignoring baskets if he want to (e.g. A1, A2, C1, D = (1 : 3.1) ) From the remaining items, the second player chooses some combination of items. The second player also has the option of selecting all the remaining items and leaving the third player with nothing. Finally, the third player chooses items from the remainder (at the end, some items can remain unchosen by all 3 players). Once each player has made their selections, the ""function"" assigns a cost to each of their selections. This function has the general form of : f(selection A = a, B = b, C = c, D = d, E = e) = Cost Let's say for the purpose of this game, the cost function isn't  ""linear"". For example f(A = A1, B = 0, C = 0, D = 0, E = 0) = 3.1 , f(A = A2 , B = 0, C = 0, D = 0, E = 0) = 1.6 , f(A = (A1, A2) , B = 0, C = 0, D = 0, E = 0 ) = 0.89. The goal of the game is for: Objective: All 3 players have to try and ensure that the total summed cost of the group's selection is as close to 30 as possible (a cost of exactly 30 automatically results in a win), but any cost over 30 automatically results in a loss. Either all 3 players win together or lose together. Constraint: Each player should at least have 1 Red Square in their selection - this will ensure none of the players can finish the game with an empty basket. Thus - what is the optimal selection that each player should make such that the group's objective is maximized and the constraint is met?

At first, the players might simply pick random selections and observe the ""Total Cost."" Later, they might use a more sophisticated approach such as ""Evolutionary Algorithms and Metaheuristics"" to ""strategically combine"" successful selections from the past and gradually progress towards more optimal selections: Although I know very little about Game Theory, I think that we might be able to view a ""progression and evolution"" of selection strategies as the number of rounds increases. For instance, Player 1 always chooses first - at first, Player 1 might behave very erratically and leave Player 2 and Player 3 in a position that will make it impossible for the group to win the game; but as all 3 players continue to play the game and try to ""reverse engineer"" the nature of the Cost Function by studying the impact of including/removing certain items on the Total Cost; they might be able to learn how to strategically cooperate with each other to win the game as a group.

My problem with the solution is the last part of it: Given a rearrangement of the numbers from 1 to n, each pair of consecutive elements a and b of the sequence can be either increasing or decreasing. How many rearrangements have of the numbers from 1 to n have exactly two increasing pairs? My answer: Well, obviously we can split these numbers into three partitions and subtract off the undesirable rearrangements. To do so, the number of total counts is $3^n$ Now, we don't wanna count those rearrangements that have 1 or 0 increasing pairs. The partitions whose associated permutation has exactly one increasing pair can be counted by splitting the numbers into two subsets with 1 increasing pair first, which gives us $2^n-(n+1)$ , and after that we split these rearrangements into another subset, and we'll have three subsets. There are $n+1$ ways to do that. So far we have $3^n-(n+1)(2^n-(n+1))$ according to the multiplication principle. Now, my problem begins when we start trying to find the number of rearrangements with no increasing pair. The solution says There are $\frac{n+2}{2}$ ways of placing two barriers between these elements to split the numbers into three subsets, and so there are $\frac{n+2}{2}$ such partitions of {1,2,..,n} into three subsets.

What I tried is to use AM-QM inequality to have a bound by first changing the above absolute value into $(x_i - x_j)^2\leq 1$ and then expanding this and summing all over the pairs, but I only get a lower bound $\frac{k^2}{n}$ and an upper bound $\frac{k^2}{n} + \frac{n-1}{2}$ . Perhaps pigeonhole then can be used to find some pairs of $i,j$ with $|x_i - x_j|\geq2$ for some pair, but I am still stuck. Trying to be exact, the most even distribution must be like $k = (q+1)r+q(n-r)$ where $q,r$ are the quotient,remainder in the division algorithm. I could not proceed any further. In general, I think instead of finding the exact minimum, we only need to show that if $|x_i - x_j|\geq 2$ , then the sum is greater than when we use the most even distribution.

For $n\geq 0$ , let $a_n$ be the number of regions into which the plane is separated by these $n$ lines. Find and solve a recurrence relation for $a_n$ . b) For the situation in part a), let $b_n$ be the number of infinite regions obtained that way. Find and solve a recurrence relation for $b_n$ . a) If we look at what happens when we add the nth line, it will intersect with all the other $n-1$ lines, so it will pass through $n$ regions, thus dividing them in two. This means that the number of regions will increase by $n$ . Therefore, our recurrence relation is: \begin{align*} a_n-a_{n-1}=n,\ n>0,\ a_0=1. \end{align*} We solve it this way in a simple way: \begin{align*} a_n=a_{n-1}+n=a_{n-2}+(n-1)=a_0+1+2+a_{n-2}+(n-1)=a_0+1+2+a_0+1+2+\dots +n. \end{align*} Therefore, we have: \begin{align*} a_n=\frac{n^2+n+2}{2},n\geq 0. \end{align*} b) Let $b_n =$ be the number of infinite regions resulting in $n$ such lines.

94,Large gap Sparse Rulers,Large gap Sparse Rulers,,"A marked integer ruler has length $n$ and integer marks from $0$ to $n$ .  It can measure any integer length from $1$ to $n$ .  The two ends of the ruler, $0$ and $n$ are considered marks. A sparse ruler can also measure any integer length from $1$ to $n$ , but has a minimal number of marks.  For example, for length $24$ , the nine marks at $(0, 1, 13, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24)$ suffice for measuring all distances from $1$ to $24$ . For any $n$ , a sparse ruler of length $n$ can be constructed with $E+\lceil {\sqrt {3n+{\tfrac {9}{4}}}}\rfloor $ marks, $E$ being the the $0$ or $1$ excess of the ruler, with OEIS A326499 giving the best known excess values, known to be true up to 213. In the example above, the ruler has a gap longer than a third of the length of the ruler, making it a large gap sparse ruler.

Slightly harder: Is there a longer large gap sparse ruler?  More explicitly: Can anyone find a length $n>322$ ruler with $E+\lceil {\sqrt {3n+{\tfrac {9}{4}}}}\rfloor $ marks that can measure all lengths from $1$ to $n$ and at least gap of length greater than $n/3$ , and $E$ being the the $0$ or $1$ excess value for $n$ listed in OEIS A326499 ? The second largest of length 262 has marks at these locations: $(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 131, 136, 141, 146, 154, 162, 170, 178, 186, 194, 202, 210, 218, 226, 234, 242, 250, 253, 256, 259, 262)$ , representable in the five part gap-repetition form $1^7 124^1 5^3 8^{13} 3^4$ . This is the longest known sparse ruler with a five part gap-repetitions.  The longest known with three part gap-repetitions has length 69 with $1^6 8^7 7^1$ . There are infinite sparse rulers with six or more gap-repetitions, the Wichmann-like rulers . EDIT:  Re-running some code managed to improve the best known large gap sparse ruler slightly.

It can measure any integer length from to .  The two ends of the ruler, and are considered marks. A sparse ruler can also measure any integer length from to , but has a minimal number of marks.  For example, for length , the nine marks at suffice for measuring all distances from to . For any , a sparse ruler of length can be constructed with marks, being the the or excess of the ruler, with OEIS A326499 giving the best known excess values, known to be true up to 213. In the example above, the ruler has a gap longer than a third of the length of the ruler, making it a large gap sparse ruler. Here are more examples of sparse rulers with large gaps: The length large gap sparse ruler is currently the longest known example. Can anyone find a length ruler with marks that can measure all lengths from to and has a gap of length greater than ? Slightly harder: Is there a longer large gap sparse ruler?  More explicitly: Can anyone find a length ruler with marks that can measure all lengths from to and at least gap of length greater than , and being the the or excess value for listed in OEIS A326499 ? The second largest of length 262 has marks at these locations: , representable in the five part gap-repetition form . This is the longest known sparse ruler with a five part gap-repetitions.
