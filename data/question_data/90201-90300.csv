Real Analysis: Measure Theory, Integration, and Hilbert Spaces. Princeton University Press (2005)","Consider exercise 23 from chapter 4 (""Hilbert Spaces: An Introduction"") of [1] (p. 198). Any help will be much appreciated. Thank you in advance. Suppose $\{T_k\}$ is a collection of bounded operators on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, with $\|T_k\|\leq1$ for all $k$. Suppose also that   $$ T_kT_j^* = T_k^*T_j = 0\hspace{1cm}\mbox{for all } k \neq j. $$   Let $S_N = \sum_{k = -N}^N T_k$. Show that $S_N(f)$ converges as $N \rightarrow \infty$, for every $f \in \mathcal{H}$. If $T(f)$ denotes the limit, prove that $\|T\| \leq 1$. [Hint: Consider first the case when only finitely many of the $T_k$ are non-zero, and note that the ranges of the $T_k$ are mutually orthogonal.] Note: I realize why - as the hint suggests - the ranges of the $T_k$'s are mutually orthogonal. Indeed, let $k, j \in \mathbb{Z}$ be distinct, and let $h_k, h_j \in \mathcal{H}$. Then $$ \left<T_j h_j, T_k h_k\right> = \left<T_k^* T_j h_j, h_k\right> = \left<0, h_k\right> = 0 $$ References [1] Stein, Elias M. and Shakarchi, Rami.

For probability measures weak (or weak-star) convergence of measures is equivalent to convergence in $||\cdot||_{FM}$.

Definition: Suppose that $(X,d)$ is a metric space. A sequence $(\textbf{x}_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ of points in $X$ is said to be a Cauchy sequence , if, given any $\epsilon>0$, there exists $N$ such that $d(\textbf{x}_m,\textbf{x}_n)<\epsilon$ whenever $N\le n<m$. Definition: Suppose that $(X,d)$ is a metric space, and that $S\subseteq X$. We say that $S$ is complete if and only if every Cauchy sequence in $S$ has a limit in $S$. Definition: Suppose that $(X,d)$ is a metric space, and that $S\subseteq X$. We say that $S$ is compact if and only if every sequence in $S$ has a convergent subsequence with limit in S. And are the proofs of the 3 following theorem correct? Theorem 1: Suppose that $(X,d)$ is a metric space. Intersection of any collection of complete subsets of $X$ is complete. Proof: Let $(\textbf{x}_n)$ be a Cauchy sequence in $\bigcap_{i\in I}A_i$, an intersection of any collection $\{A_i\}_{i\in I}$ of complete subsets of $X$. Since $(\textbf{x}_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\bigcap_{i\in I}A_i$, it is a Cauchy sequence in $A_1$. Since $A_1$ is complete, $\textbf x_n \rightarrow \textbf x$ where $\textbf x \in A_1$. Similarly, since $(\textbf{x}_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\bigcap_{i\in I}A_i$, it is a Cauchy sequence in $A_2$. Since $A_2$ is complete, $\textbf x \in A_2$. Without loss of generality, $\textbf x \in A_i$ for all $I\in I$. $\therefore x\in \bigcap_{i\in I}A_i$. Hence $\bigcap_{i\in I}A_i$, the intersection of any collection of complete subsets of $X$ is complete. Theorem 2: Suppose that $(X,d)$ is a metric space. The intersection of a compact set and a closed set in $X$ is compact. Proof: Denote $E\subseteq X$ to be the compact set in $X$ and $W$ to be a closed set in $X$. We know that a compact set in a metric space is also complete and complete sets are closed in $X$. Therefore $E$ is closed. Now, $E \cap W$ is a closed set, since intersection of any collection of closed sets is closed. And $E \cap W \subseteq E$. Now, suppose that $(\textbf{x}_n)$ be a sequence in $E \cap W$ and so in $E$. Since $E$ is compact, $(\textbf{x}_n)$ has a convergent subsequence with limit $\textbf x$, say. If $\textbf x=\textbf x_n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then clearly $\textbf x \in E\cap W$. If $\textbf x \neq \textbf x_n$ for any $n\in \mathbb{N}$, then $\textbf x$ is an accumulation point of $E\cap W$, so that $\textbf x \in E\cap W$ since $E\cap W$ is closed. Hence, $E\cap W$, the intersection of a compact set and a closed set in $X$ is compact, since every sequence in $E\cap W$ has a convergent subsequence in $E\cap W$. Theorem 3: Suppose that $(X,d)$ is a metric space. The intersection of any collection of compact sets in $X$ is compact. Proof: Let $\{A_i\}_{i\in I}$ be any collection compact sets of $X$. For all $I\in I$, $A_i$ is a closed set, since compact sets are closed. Moreover, intersection of any collection of closed sets in $X$ is closed, hence $\bigcap_{i\in I}A_i$ is a closed set. Also, we have $\bigcap_{i\in I}A_i \subseteq A_1$. Now, suppose that $(\textbf{x}_n)$ be a sequence in $\bigcap_{i\in I}A_i$ and so in $A_1$.
