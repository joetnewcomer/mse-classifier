1,Aesthetic proofs that involve Field Theory / Galois Theory,Aesthetic proofs that involve Field Theory / Galois Theory,,"I am preparing for an oral exam on Abstract Algebra, especially Field Theory and Galois Theory. Now, I'm looking for some aesthetic proofs that involve Galois Theory/Field Theory for two reasons. I may be asked to point out the basic concepts of Galois Theory and their fields of applications and consequences. Therefore it might be useful to know an non-standard example. I am just interested in the field of Abstract Algebra and I'm looking forward to find some topics and fields, in which I can intensify my knowledge. I know already two very basic examples: The application of Field Theory to clarify the classical antique problems on Straightedge and Compass Construction (Squaring the Circle, Doubling the Cube, Angle Trisection, Construction of a regular Polygon). The application of Galois Theory to determine whether a polynomial is solvable in radicals. Which further aesthetic proofs are there, that involve the basic concepts and theorems of Field Theory / Galois Theory?

3,Proof that every group of order 4 is abelian,Proof that every group of order 4 is abelian,,"I know there are questions on this already but I wanted to check if my attempt at proving it was valid, and I couldn't find anyone else presenting the same one in any other post. My attempt is as follows: Since there must be a unique identity, and a unique inverse for each element, I believe that without loss of generality I can let the group be $G = \{e, a, a^{-1}, b\}$ where $e$ is the identity and $a,b$ are some other elements not equal to $e$. Then by a previous result we know that the identity element is commutative and that an element and its inverse commute with each other. This tells us that $e.x=x.e$ for all $x$ in G, and that $a.a^{-1}=a^{-1}.a$. This leaves only $a.b$ and $a^{-1}.b$ to check. One of $a$ or $a^{-1}$ must be an inverse for $b$ and since $a,a^{-1}$ are arbitrary, say it is $a$. Then we have $a.b=b.a$. If we multiply both sides of this equality by $a^{-1}$ on the left and right we are left with $b.a^{-1}=a^{-1}.b$ which is the final possibility.

We didn't mention it in our lectures so I have to understand it on my own. I saw some posts here and on the internet and I understand that: Formal power series are a generalisation of polynomials, in that the coefficients can be infinite while in the polynomial they have to end at one point. Then I guess we can evaluate the polynomial and therefore have a function while this isn't so simple in power series since they do not always converge. I feel like this is a difference between polynomials and power series, but what about them as rings? Does it make a difference? Are there other important differences?

I do this by contradiction, assume $\phi$ is such an isomorphism from $2\mathbb{Z}$ to $3\mathbb{Z}$. Observe this equality: $$\phi(2)+\phi(2)=\phi(2+2)=\phi(2\cdot2)=\phi(2)\cdot\phi(2)$$ Let $x=\phi(2)$ and we have the equation $x^2-2x=0$ in $3\mathbb{Z}$.

The book I'm reading introduces polynomials over a field and proves the statement that a polynomial of degree $n$ has at most $n$ zeros. They do this by using division algorithm and induction. Then they make the following remark: This is not true for polynomial over arbitrary rings. For instance $x^2 + 7 \in \mathbb{Z}_8$ has roots $1,3,5,$ and $7$. My question: what fails in the previous proof for arbitrary rings? They just made that remark and moved on. Edit -- Proof (from Gallian): We proceed by induction on $n$. Clearly, a polynomial of degree $0$ over a field has no zeros. Now suppose that $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $n$ over a field and $a$ is a zero of $f(x)$ of multi­plicity $k$. Then, $f(x)=(x-a)^kq(x)$ and $q(a) \neq 0$. Note we have $\text{deg }f = n = k + \text{deg }q$. If $f(x)$ has no zeros other than $a$, we are done. On the other hand, if $b \neq a$ and $b$ is a zero of $f(x)$, then $0=f(b)=(b-a)^kq(b)$ so that $b$ is a zero for $q(x)$ with the same multiplicity it has for $f(x)$. By the Second Principle of Mathematical Induction, we know that $q(x)$ has at most deg $q(x)=n-k$ zeros, counting multiplicity.

We must show that this map ψ is well defined,so show that if $g(x)=h(x)$ where $g,h \in G$ , then $gG_x=hG_x$ .

Then, why did they need to show its well-defined property in this proof. If showing firstly being well-defined function is mandatory in bijective functions, why dont we always see it in some other proofs ?

(2 answers) Closed last month . The community reviewed whether to reopen this question last month and left it closed: Original close reason(s) were not resolved I am first year university student, we saw some proofs in class. I am trying to understand them from other sources if I could not understand them at that moment, because the class is crowded and I am ashamed of asking stupid question among others. The following question is one of them. I am trying to understand the proof of orbit stabilizer theorem, but I stuck in one point I made research about  the proof of orbit-stabilizer theorem. I have seen some proof approaches, but something was interesting for me. The interesting part was showing well-define property of bijection function. Let me introduce you a part of a sample proof: We define a one-to-one map from onto the collection of left cosets of in such that . We must show that this map ψ is well defined,so show that if where , then . Here denotes orbits and denotes stabilizer I did not write the rest of proof,because my question is up to now. I saw some proofs in my other math classes such that we used bijective functions for showing one to one correspondence between sets to show that their cardinalities are equal, but we have never needed to prove that the functions we selected for bijectivity is well defined by using the condition if where x and y are elements of domain,then Look here for well defined However, when I look at all proofs in books and internet, they always firstly prove that the bijection function is well defined. Then, why did they need to show its well-defined property in this proof. If showing firstly being well-defined function is mandatory in bijective functions, why dont we always see it in some other proofs ? Can you please enlighten me the reason why being well defines is always proved in all resources ?
