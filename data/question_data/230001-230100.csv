It seems fairly obvious because, if you get those additional elements out, then you have the same cardinality in both sides. The problem is, I have to find a way to prove it using the bijection definition. So my guess is, I know that $ \exists f: (A \cup \{a\}) \rightarrow (B \cup \{ b \}) $ that is bijective. So there must exist $g: \{a\} \rightarrow \{ b \} $, which is clearly bijective, so that $\exists h: A \rightarrow B $ that is also bijective.
