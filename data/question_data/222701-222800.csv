5,Computing a contraction of an exceptional divisor.,Computing a contraction of an exceptional divisor.,,"For a few days, I have been working on the following problem, from Qing Liu's book: Let $\mathcal{O_K}$ be a discrete valuation ring with uniformizing parameter t and residue characteristic $\neq 2,3$. Let $X = Proj \mathcal{O}_K[u,v,w] /(u^2w+v^3+t^6w^3)$. Determine the minimal desingularization of X. I have been able to desingularize X by blowing it up first at $(t,u,v)$ to obtain $\widetilde{X}$and then, calling the additional coordinates in the blow-up by $(x_1,x_2,x_3)$, blowing $\widetilde{X}$ up at $(t,x_2,x_3)$ and then normalizing the corresponding scheme one gets. Let  us call this scheme, obtained from two blow-ups and normalizing for $Z$, and the scheme we get from blowing up twice for $Y$. I then got that: $$Z = Proj \widetilde{X}[v_1,v_2,v_3]/(v_1x_2-tv_2,v_1x_3-tv_3,v_2x_3-v_3x_2,v_1v_2^2+v_3^3+v_1^3)$$ and $$\widetilde{X} = Proj X[x_1,x_2,x_3]/(x_1u-tx_2,x_1v-tx_3w,x_2^2w+x_3^2v+t^4x_1^2).$$ However, I might have made a mistake , but I believe Z to be regular. Now, one can check that there is an exceptional E divisor in $Z_k$, in $Z$ has defining equations $$(t,u,v,v_1,v_3).$$ I want to contract this E, so I should find an ample effective cartier divisor D such that $\mathcal{O}_Z(D)$ is generated by global sections, $\mathcal{O}_Z(D)_{Z_K}$ (restriction to the generic fiber) is ample, $Supp D \cap E = \emptyset$ and for any other curve on $Z$, the restriction of $\mathcal{O}_Z(D)$ to it is ample. Now, I get that we should look for such a divisor in the generic fiber, and I believe that I might have found a candidate, namely $D=(v_3+v_1,v_2)$. I also believe that by Riemann-Rochlike theorems, $3D$ should be ample and generated by global sections. However, here is my problem: I want to see, in concrete, how I can calculate the contraction morphism AND the resulting scheme one gets.

But when I have been trying to do this, I get hopefully stuck, and I end up getting nowhere.

So there might be some other neighborhood of $p$ that I am missing, or the statement in bold is not true.

42,"Global version of an ideal being ""finitely generated up to radical""","Global version of an ideal being ""finitely generated up to radical""",,"Let $X$ be a quasicompact, quasiseparated scheme and $Z$ a closed subset of $X$ with quasicompact complement. Is there a finite type quasicoherent ideal sheaf $\mathcal{J}$ on $X$ which cuts out $Z$ ? (more formally, such that $\mathcal{O}_X/\mathcal{J}$ has support $Z$ ?) In the affine case the answer is yes: $V(\mathfrak{a})$ has quasicompact complement iff $\mathfrak{a}$ is finitely generated up to radical (edit: meaning there are finitely many $f_1,\ldots,f_n$ such that $\sqrt{(f_1,\ldots,f_n)} = \sqrt{\mathfrak{a}}$ ). But I'm having trouble globalizing this. We can take a finite cover of $X$ by affines (and cover all pairwise intersections by finitely many mutually distinguished opens) and take arbitrary finitely generated defining ideals on each affine, but I don't see how we can modify these such that they glue together to a global ideal sheaf. Here is what I've thought about so far: write $X = U_1 \cup \ldots \cup U_n$ for $U_i$ affine and $U_{ij} = V_{ij}^1 \cup \ldots \cup V_{ij}^{k_{ij}}$ . Let $\mathfrak{a}_i \leq \mathcal{O}_X(U_i)$ be a finitely generated ideal with $V(\mathfrak{a}_i) = Z \cap U_i$ . We can choose $N$ uniform such that for any $i, j$ we have $(\mathfrak{a}_i \mathcal{O}_X(U_{ij}))^N \subseteq \mathfrak{a}_j \mathcal{O}_X(U_{ij})$ . In fact more is true: write $U_{ij} = D(f_i)$ for $f_i \in \mathcal{O}_X(U_i)$ and $\mathfrak{a}_i = (a_{i,1},\ldots,a_{i, r_i})$ ; then there is some uniform $K$ such that for any $i, j$ and any product of $N$ generators of $ \mathfrak{a}_i$ there is a relation showing that that product lies in $\mathfrak{a}_j \mathcal{O}_X(U_{ij})$ whose coefficients' denominators have power of $f_j$ at most $K$ . But I don't see how any of this actually helps. I would prefer a ""global"" or ""all at once"" answer rather than one which uses the induction principle for qcqs schemes. Edit: Here is a construction which I think works, but I'm unsure. Cover $X$ by finitely many affine opens and cover the pairwise intersections by finitely many simultaneously distinguished opens. Further iterated intersections will be affine (they're distinguished in some cover element) and there are only finitely many of them overall. So we have a finite set $\mathcal{P}$ of affine opens which cover $X$ and where the pairwise intersection of any two elements is covered by elements. Since $\mathcal{P}$ is finite it's in particular well founded and so we can define functions on it by recursion; we use this to define a family of finitely generated ideals $I(U) \leq \mathcal{O}_X(U)$ such that $I(U)$ has vanishing locus $Z \cap U$ and $I(U) \mathcal{O}_X(V) \subseteq I(V)$ whenever $V\subseteq U$ . Let $U\in \mathcal{P}$ be arbitrary and suppose $I(V)$ has been defined for all $V \subsetneq U$ in $\mathcal{P}$ . Because $U$ is affine and $Z\cap U$ is a closed subset with quasicompact complement there is a finitely generated ideal $J \leq \mathcal{O}_X(U)$ with vanishing locus $Z\cap U$ . Then for each $V \subsetneq U$ the ideal $J \mathcal{O}_X(V)$ is finitely generated and contained in $\sqrt{I(V)}$ , which implies there is some $n$ such that $J^n \mathcal{O}_X(V) \leq I(V)$ . Since there are only finitely many $V$ we can find a uniform $N$ such that for any $V$ we have $J^N \mathcal{O}_X(V) \leq I(V)$ . Define $I(U) = J^N$ . This construction gives us a diagram of ideals of $\mathcal{O}_X(U)$ for $U\in \mathcal{P}$ . If we let $i_U : U \to X$ be the inclusion then we can also view $U \mapsto (i_U)_*\widetilde{I(U)}$ as a functor $\mathcal{P}^{\mathrm{op}} \to \mathcal{O}_X-\mathsf{Mod}$ equipped with a monomorphism to the functor $U \mapsto (i_U)_*i_U^*\mathcal{O}_X$ . Since $X$ is qcqs all these pushforwards are in fact quasicoherent modules, and the sheaf condition tells us the limit of that latter functor is $\mathcal{O}_X$ . Then $\mathcal{J} = \lim_{U\in\mathcal{P}} (i_U)_*\widetilde{I(U)}$ is a quasicoherent sheaf equipped with a monomorphism to $\mathcal{O}_X$ (the limit of a family of monomorphisms between two diagrams is a monomorphism) ie is a quasicoherent ideal sheaf. We built this $\mathcal{J}$ by locally constructing a fg ideal cutting out the right subset, so it feels like it should still be fg with the right support. But maybe taking this limit destroys any hope of finiteness? I guess the hope is that a finite limit of (sheaves of) rings equipped with finite type ideal sheaves is still finite type?","Let be a quasicompact, quasiseparated scheme and a closed subset of with quasicompact complement. Is there a finite type quasicoherent ideal sheaf on which cuts out ? (more formally, such that has support ?) In the affine case the answer is yes: has quasicompact complement iff is finitely generated up to radical (edit: meaning there are finitely many such that ). But I'm having trouble globalizing this. We can take a finite cover of by affines (and cover all pairwise intersections by finitely many mutually distinguished opens) and take arbitrary finitely generated defining ideals on each affine, but I don't see how we can modify these such that they glue together to a global ideal sheaf. Here is what I've thought about so far: write for affine and . Let be a finitely generated ideal with . We can choose uniform such that for any we have . In fact more is true: write for and ; then there is some uniform such that for any and any product of generators of there is a relation showing that that product lies in whose coefficients' denominators have power of at most . But I don't see how any of this actually helps. I would prefer a ""global"" or ""all at once"" answer rather than one which uses the induction principle for qcqs schemes. Edit: Here is a construction which I think works, but I'm unsure. Cover by finitely many affine opens and cover the pairwise intersections by finitely many simultaneously distinguished opens. Further iterated intersections will be affine (they're distinguished in some cover element) and there are only finitely many of them overall. So we have a finite set of affine opens which cover and where the pairwise intersection of any two elements is covered by elements. Since is finite it's in particular well founded and so we can define functions on it by recursion; we use this to define a family of finitely generated ideals such that has vanishing locus and whenever . Let be arbitrary and suppose has been defined for all in . Because is affine and is a closed subset with quasicompact complement there is a finitely generated ideal with vanishing locus . Then for each the ideal is finitely generated and contained in , which implies there is some such that . Since there are only finitely many we can find a uniform such that for any we have . Define . This construction gives us a diagram of ideals of for . If we let be the inclusion then we can also view as a functor equipped with a monomorphism to the functor .

My thought process is inspired by the case of $\mathbb{Q}= F$ - here, we cannot factor polynomials such as $f(x) = x^2 - 2$ , so we devise the algebraic extension $\mathbb{Q}(x)/x^2-2$ , quotienting by the ideal generated by $f$ . Similarly, it seems that for an arbitrary case, we can simply consider $\mathbb{F}[x_1...x_n]/f$ , which is a field whenever $f$ is irreducible. Therefore, perhaps we get the restriction that we can always construct field extensions wherein all irreducible polynomials are factorable. This is Idea 1. However, Idea 1 is the same as Idea 2, wherein we take some wonderful object $a$ such that it satisfies the relation $f(a) = a^2 - 2=0$ , adjoin it to $\mathbb{Q}$ , and yield $\mathbb{Q}(a)$ - a field wherein $f$ as above now factors.

So I'm asking: 1 Can anyone confirm, using any method, that $\pi_1(UF_2)=\left<a,b,c,d,s\big|[a,b][c,d]=s^2\right>$? 2 Can anyone confirm that $UF_2$ is a quotient of $\widetilde{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ by a isometry group? 3 Can anyone write down an explicit method for calculating $\pi_1(UF_2)$? Thank you all",,"['algebraic-geometry', 'hyperbolic-geometry', 'fundamental-groups', 'fiber-bundles']"

If an orbit $G\cdot x$ is closed in the standard topology on $V$, is it also Zariski-closed? Sometimes it is easier to see that an orbit is closed in the usual topology rather than showing that it satisfies some polynomial equations. But I am not sure if this is sufficient to infer that the orbit is Zariski-closed. I couldn't find any counterexample though.","Let $G$ be a complex linear algebraic group acting linearly on finite-dimensional complex vector space $V$.

96,Maps to $\mathbb{P}^1$ induced by rational functions.,Maps to  induced by rational functions.,\mathbb{P}^1,"I am reading from Hartshorne, Corollary II.6.10 page 138. Given a nonsingular (is this necessary?) curve $X$ over a field $k$, let $f\in K(X)^*\setminus k$. Then the inclusion of fields $k(f)\subseteq K(X)$ (finite field extension) induces a finite morphism $\phi:X\to \mathbb{P}^1$. Question 1: why? For example, how is $\phi$ defined scheme-theoretically? Because Hartshorne cites what he did in Chapter I using valuations, but to me it is really unsatisfying to have to follow 100 equivalences of categories just to understand this construction (in fact I have been trying to do that many times, but always failed). Now it is stated that $(f)=\phi^*(0-\infty)$. Question 2: this is supposed to be obvious, but to me is not (maybe an answer to question 1 will settle this immediatly). Also does $k$ have to be algebraically closed? I don't think so, but in chapter I it is always assumed.","I am reading from Hartshorne, Corollary II.6.10 page 138.

99,A question on algebraic geometry.,A question on algebraic geometry.,,"In a course about algebraic geometry I am taking, a question appeared in class which claimed that $A=\mathbb{C}[x,y]/(xy-1)$ is a field.

However there is something I am missing here, I understand that one can obtain alot of information about $A$ by considering the curve $xy-1=0$ but why is it OK to substitute $y$ with $1/x$ in the actual ring? This seems fishy to me, is it really true that $\mathbb{C}[x,y]/(xy-1) = \mathbb{C}[x,\frac {1}{x}]$?
