0,Counting Hamiltonian cycles in a graph,Counting Hamiltonian cycles in a graph,,"Given a graph $G = (W \cup U, E)$ where $W = \{w_1, w_2, ..., w_n\}$, $U = \{u_1, u_2, ..., u_n\}$ and $E = \{\{w_i, u_j\}: 1 \leq i, j \leq n\}$. The task is to calculate the number of Hamiltonian cycles in the graph G. The way I tried solving was, Our vertex set $V = \{w_1, w_2 ... w_n, u_1, u_2, ... u_n\}$ Since we know 2 vertices $w_i \in W \text{ and } u_j \in U$ are adjacent if $1 \leq i, u \leq n$, this makes every vertex in W adjacent to every vertex in U giving us a bipartite graph. Also by Dirac's theorem $deg(v) \leq \frac{|V|}{2}$ for a graph to be Hamiltonian. So the task at hand condenses down to finding the number of hamiltonian cycles in a complete bipartite graph with n and n vertices i.e. $K_{n,n}$. Which is $\frac{n!(n-1)!}{2}$, taken from here .

I have conjectured and attempted to prove that biconditional implication $\leftrightarrow$ is an equivalence relation. Proof: Let $p, q, r$ be propositions with value true or false. Claim 1: $\leftrightarrow$ is reflexive. If $p$ is a proposition with value true or false, $\neg p \lor p$ is a tautology, but by the law of material implication $\neg p \lor p \equiv p \to p$. So $p \to p$ together with itself gives $p \leftrightarrow p$ and $\leftrightarrow$ is reflexive. Claim 2: $\leftrightarrow$ is symmetric. Suppose $p \leftrightarrow q$. Then by definition, $p \to q \land q \to p$. The commutative law gives $q \to p \land p \to q \equiv q \leftrightarrow p$ and hence $\leftrightarrow$ is symmetric.

From this it follows that every family of open sets defined on $E$ is a sub-lattice, as well as every family of closed sets, since ""arbitrary intersections"" corresponds to ""finite intersections"" since $2^E$ is finite, likewise ""arbitrary intersections"" corresponds to ""finite intersectins"" for the same reason. The question in the title corresponds then to the converse of this fact, namely: Question: For any finite set $E$, does any sub-lattice of $(2^E, \subseteq)$ define a topology? (With the topology defined equivalently via open sets or closed sets -- all finite topological spaces are Alexandrov , so the properties of open sets and closed sets are the same .) Clearly being a sub-lattice implies closure under finite non-empty unions and finite non-empty intersections. But whether a sub-lattice has to be closed under empty unions and empty intersections, hence contain both $\emptyset$ and $E$ and therefore be a topology is what makes my head hurt. Issue 1: One will often read that the third axiom of open sets (or closed sets), that both $\emptyset$ and $E$ have to be open (respectively closed) sets is supposed to be redundant , since closure under finite intersections (respectively finite unions) implies closure under the empty intersection so that $E$ is open (respectively closure under the empty union so that $\emptyset$ is closed). However, this logic seems somewhat flawed, depending specifically on how the closure under finite unions/intersections axiom is stated. For definiteness consider the case of closed sets. One will often write that closed sets are closed under finite unions in the following manner: If $X_1, X_2$ are both closed, then $X_1 \cup X_2$ is also closed. Clearly, by induction , it follows from this that all non-empty finite unions are again closed sets (the union of one set, case $n=1$, following from taking $X_1 = X_2$). But $n=0< 1$ and $n=0<2$; so how can closure under an empty union follow by induction from finite unions for $n=1,2$ as base cases? However, if one simply wrote ""Closed sets are closed under finite unions"", then it would be clear to me that the empty union should be included, because that is clearly a finite union. Issue 2: The flats of a matroid with ground set $E$ always form a sub-lattice of $(2^E, \subseteq)$. So if this converse were true, it would mean that every family of flats forms a topology on the ground set. However, in general matroid axiomatizations and topological space axiomatizations are supposed to be inequivalent. This answer gives an example of how the matroid analog of topological closed sets, flats, need not be closed under unions. The Kuratowski closure axioms are also evidently different from the matroid closure axioms. Likewise the cyclic set axioms for matroids guarantee closure under finite unions, but not under finite intersections. The hyperplane axioms are similar but not the same as the closed base axioms , and the circuit axioms are similar but not the same as the open base axioms . Finally, Oxley, in Matroid Theory , only states that the least element of the flat lattice is $cl(\emptyset)$, which seems to imply that the (matroid) closure of the empty set is not always the empty set, hence $\emptyset$ is not always a flat thus not always the least element of the flat sub-lattice of $(2^E, \subseteq)$. In contrast, $cl(\emptyset)=\emptyset$ always for the topological (Kuratowski) closure, since the empty set is always closed, either per fiat or due to closure under finite unions. The lattice of flats is not a sub-lattice of $(2^E, \subseteq)$, since the join operation is different. The meet operation is the same though. Also the claim in issue one corresponds to one of the flat axioms being ""$E$ is a flat"" even though the second flat axiom is ""$F_1, F_2$ flats implies $F_1 \cap F_2$ are flats"". I.e. the second axiom doesn't seem to imply closure under empty intersection, hence not closure under all finite intersections. Issue 3: 2 : The footnote 6 at the bottom of page 10 here says that [emphasis mine]: A lattice is a partial order in which any finite non-empty set has an infimum and supremum. Equivalently , any two elements   $x$ and $y$ have a supremum $ x \lor y$, and an infimum $ x \land y$. In particular, based on this statement it does not seem like any empty set has to have an infimum (it can, but it doesn't have to), which for $(2^E, \subseteq)$ would seem to correspond to sub-lattices not needing to be closed under empty intersections.

Is this relation   antisymmetric, connex? Justify your decision. A relation is antisymmetric if $\forall x,y \in A: xRy \wedge yRx \Rightarrow x=y$ A relation is connex, if $\forall x,y \in A: (x,y) \in R \vee (y,x) \in R $ or $x=y$ The sum of two numbers is even if and only if both summands are even or both summands are odd. antisymmetric: If we have $aRb$, then both summands are either even or odd, same applies for $bRa$.

Maybe I think a bit too simple about the problem, but it says ""… If $G$ also has a vertex of degree less than $k$ …"" , that means that $G$ only needs to have at least one node with degree less than the maximum degree $k$ . So to answer a) I thought of this graph: The maximum degree here is 2 and it also has one node that has degree less than 2, but you still need $k+1$ colors to color it, so the claim can't be true in this case. Next, they also provide a bogus proof for the claim: Identify the exact sentence where the proof goes wrong. Induction hypothesis: P(n) is defined to be: Let $G$ be a graph with $n$ vertices and maximum degree at most $k$ . If $G$ also has a vertex of degree less than $k$ , then $G$ is $k$ -colorable. Base case: ( $n=1$ ) $G$ has only one vertex and so is 1-colorable. So P (1) holds. Inductive step: We may assume $P(n)$ . To prove $P(n + 1)$ , let $G_{n+1}$ be a graph with n + 1 vertices and maximum degree at most k. Also, suppose $G_{n+1}$ has a vertex, $v$ , of degree less than k. We need only prove that $G_{n+1}$ is $k$ -colorable. To do this, first remove the vertex v to produce a graph, $G_n$ , with n vertices. Removing v reduces the degree of all vertices adjacent to v by 1. So in $G_n$ , each of these vertices has degree less than k. Also the maximum degree of $G_n$ remains at most k. So $G_n$ satisfies the conditions of the induction hypothesis $P(n)$ . We conclude that $G_n$ is k-colorable. Now a k-coloring of Gn gives a coloring of all the vertices of $G_{n+1}$ , except for v. Since v has degree less than k, there will be fewer than k colors assigned to the nodes adjacent to v. So among the k possible colors, there will be a color not used to color these adjacent nodes, and this color can be assigned to v to form a k-coloring of $G_{n+1}$ . We need to identify where the proof goes wrong. This one I find a bit harder, as the proof is relatively long. For me, the base case seems off. It reads: Base case: (n=1) G has only one vertex and so is 1-colorable. So P (1) holds. It's true that you can color a one node graph with one color. But the claim talks about a graph that has degree at most k (which is 0 in a one node graph) that also has a vertex with a degree less than k (which would be -1 or less?), but the single node in that graph has degree k (which is 0 and equals the maximum degree of that graph which is also 0).

It reads: Base case: (n=1) G has only one vertex and so is 1-colorable. So P (1) holds. It's true that you can color a one node graph with one color. But the claim talks about a graph that has degree at most k (which is 0 in a one node graph) that also has a vertex with a degree less than k (which would be -1 or less?), but the single node in that graph has degree k (which is 0 and equals the maximum degree of that graph which is also 0).
