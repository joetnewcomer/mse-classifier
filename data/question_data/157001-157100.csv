0,"When number theorists use the notation $\sum_{d|n}$, why don't they count the ""multiplicity"" of a divisor? Why is it not-so-interesting to count it?","When number theorists use the notation , why don't they count the ""multiplicity"" of a divisor? Why is it not-so-interesting to count it?",\sum_{d|n},"This is a question a student asked me when I was teaching a class. When I use the notation $\sum_{d|n}f(d)$ , each divisor is only counted once without multiplicity. If $n=4$ , then $\sum_{d|4}f(d)=f(1)+f(2)+f(4)$ instead of $\sum_{d|4}f(d)=f(1)+2f(2)+f(4)$ .  But instead of just telling the student, this is just what this notation is defined. It is the convention . I can also say, oh you can think of $f(4)$ as ""counting the multiplicity"" but I am also not satisfied with this answer as well. Are there any more insightful explanations from experts in number theory? For example, in the definition of the divisor sum functions $\sigma_k(n)$ , we don't count the multiplicity of a divisor. But is there a reason that ""counting the multiplicity of a divisor"" not so interesting? Or there are people who seriously studied it and I just missed an important part of literature. As per comments below, maybe let me try to define ""multiplicity"" here, which is by no means standard definitions in number theory, there are two possible ways I can think of (when that student asked this question, they didn't think very hard about it. They just believe $2$ shouldn't be counted just once as a divisor of $4$ ): Definition 1: If $d\ne 1$ is a divisor of $n$ , then the multiplicity of $d$ in $n$ is the largest $k$ such that $d^k|n$ . The multiplicity of $1$ in $n$ is considered as $1$ . For example, the multiplicity of $2$ in $8$ is $3$ . The multiplicity of $6$ in $12$ under this definition is $1$ . Definition 2: If If $d\ne 1$ is a divisor of $n$ , suppose $d=p_1^{r_1}\cdots p_l^{r_l}$ and $n=d=p_1^{s_1}\cdots p_k^{s_k}$ with $l\le k, r_i\le s_i$ , then the multiplicity of $d$ in $n$ is $\binom{s_1}{r_1}\cdots \binom{s_l}{r_l}$ . For example, the multiplicity of $6$ in $12$ under this definition is $2$ , since $6=2\times 3$ and there are two choices for $2$ in the prime decomposition of $12$ .","This is a question a student asked me when I was teaching a class.

Is it the case that $|E(\Q)_{tors}|$ is equal to the greatest common divisor of $|E(\F_p)|$ over all primes $p>2$ of good reduction of $E$ ? The former certainly divides the latter, since $E(\Q)_{tors}$ embeds in $E(\F_p)$ for all odd primes of good reduction. The answer to the above question is no, as illustrated by an elliptic curve $E:y^2=x^3+x$ , which has $E(\Q)_{tors}\cong\Z/2$ , yet $|E(\F_p)|$ is divisible by $4$ for all $p\geq 3$ . However, if we know the structure of $E(\F_p)$ for all $p$ , then we can still recover $E(\Q)_{tors}$ - for instance, $E(\F_3)\cong\Z/4$ and $E(\F_5)\cong\Z/2\times\Z/2$ and so $E(\Q)_{tors}$ , which embeds into both of those, must be equal to $\Z/2$ (it can't be smaller due to the obvious point $(0,0)$ ). This is Example 4.6 from Silverman-Tate's book. Based on this latter observation, the friend has further queried whether it is always necessarily the case, that is whether $E(\Q)_{tors}$ can be always determined to be the largest group which embeds into $E(\F_p)$ for all odd primes of good reduction. I would be quite surprised if that was the case, and I vaguely recall seeing a counterexample, but I had no luck finding it online.

So to state it more precisely, $$S(n) = \sum_{m=1}^{\pi(n)} \prod_{k=1}^m \left(1-\frac{1}{p_k}\right)$$ Specifically, what are the asymptotics of $S(n)$ as a function of $n$? Background: this comes up in the analysis of a naive algorithm for generating all primes up to $n$, which is to sequentially try dividing each number by all known smaller primes: The most naive algorithm is for each $m \le n$, divide it (i.e. just find remainder) by each number $d \le m$, and declare $m$ prime if all those remainders are nonzero. This performs $\sim m$ arithmetic operations (finding remainders) for each $m$, so overall it would perform a number of remainder-operations proportional to $1 + 2 + \dots + m + \dots + n = \Theta(n^2)$. Somewhat better is this algorithm, which for each $m \le n$, divides it by each prime $p \le m$ until a zero remainder is found: so all numbers $m$ are tried dividing by $2$, the numbers divided by $3$ would be those that survive (the odd numbers), the numbers divided by $5$ would be the numbers divisible neither by $2$ nor $3$ (thus $\left(1 - \frac12\right)\left(1 - \frac13\right)$ of the numbers), etc. I'm fairly sure this would be worse than the Sieve of Eratosthenes, which does about $\left(\frac{n}{2} + \frac{n}{3} + \frac{n}{5} + \dots + \frac{n}{p_{\pi(n)}}\right) = \Theta(n \log \log n)$ arithmetic operations (none of them division operations actually).

I'm interested in the value of the following sum: $$S(n) = \left(1 - \frac12\right) + \left(1 - \frac12\right)\left(1 - \frac13\right) + \left(1 - \frac12\right)\left(1 - \frac13\right)\left(1 - \frac15\right) + \dots + \prod_{k = 1}^{\pi(n)}\left(1 - \frac1{p_k}\right)$$ The $m$th term of the series is the product of $\left(1 - \frac{1}{p}\right)$ for the first $m$ primes; there are $\pi(n)$ terms in the sum; the last term is the product of $\left(1 - \frac{1}{p}\right)$ over all primes $p \le n$. So to state it more precisely, $$S(n) = \sum_{m=1}^{\pi(n)} \prod_{k=1}^m \left(1-\frac{1}{p_k}\right)$$ Specifically, what are the asymptotics of $S(n)$ as a function of $n$? Background: this comes up in the analysis of a naive algorithm for generating all primes up to $n$, which is to sequentially try dividing each number by all known smaller primes: The most naive algorithm is for each $m \le n$, divide it (i.e. just find remainder) by each number $d \le m$, and declare $m$ prime if all those remainders are nonzero. This performs $\sim m$ arithmetic operations (finding remainders) for each $m$, so overall it would perform a number of remainder-operations proportional to $1 + 2 + \dots + m + \dots + n = \Theta(n^2)$.

He show that $A$ contains no largest number and $B$ contains no smallest More explicitly, for every $p$ in $A$ we can find a rational $q$ in $A$ such that $p < q$ and vice versa He then shows $$q = p - \frac{p^2 - 2}{p + 2}$$ $$q^2 - 2 = \frac{2(p^2 - 2)}{(p + 2)^2}$$ and conclude that if $p$ in $A$ then $p^2 - 2 < 0 \rightarrow q^2 < 2$ and $q > p $ and vice versa.
