2,Blow-up of the affine cone,Blow-up of the affine cone,,"I was trying to blow-up at the origin of the cone $X$ given by the equation $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$ .

I take the usual affine charts $ u = 1, v = 1, t = 1$ . In the first chart with coordinates $(x,v,t)$ , the equations become $z = xt, y = xv$ so $x^2(1+v^2) = x^2t^2$ . So we obtain $x=0$ and $v,t$ are free or $1 + v^2 = t^2$ . Similarly the second chart gives $\{(0,u,t) \mid u,t \in \mathbb A^1\} \cup \{ (y,u,t) \in \mathbb A^3 \mid 1 + u^2 = t^2 \}$ .

In particular, I am stuck on part (a) which boils down to showing the following. Let $X$ be integral, separated and locally factorial. Let $U$ be any open neighbourhood of a closed point $x$. Suppose that $Z := X- U$ is irreducible with generic point $\zeta$. Then there is a line bundle $\mathcal{L}$ and $s \in H^0(X,\mathcal{L})$ with $x \in X_s \subseteq U$. Now I have convinced myself using separatedness of $X$ that we may choose a rational function $f$ with the property that $f \in \mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ and $f \notin \mathcal{O}_{X,\zeta}$. With this, we immediately deduce that for any $z \in Z$, $f \notin \mathcal{O}_{X,z}$ because we have an injection $$ \mathcal{O}_{X,z} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{O}_{X,\zeta}.$$ Edit: Ok here is an argument which I think works. It is not hard to see that $$H^0(X,\mathcal{L}(D)) = \{ f \in K(X)^\ast : div(f) + D \geq 0\} \cup \{0\},$$ i.e. all rational functions whose poles are no worse than $D$.

52,How to find a bijection between R-valued points of X and local ring homomorphisms?,How to find a bijection between R-valued points of X and local ring homomorphisms?,,"I am trying to prove the following fact for a homework assignment in algebraic geometry: Let R be a local ring, and X a prescheme. Show that there is a one-one correspondence between R-valued points on X and pairs (x, g) of points x on X and local homomorphisms $g: O_{X, x} \to R$. Now, given f: Spec R -> X, and writing x for f(M) where M is the maximal ideal of R, the induced map on stalks gives us a map $g: O_{X,x} \to R_M = R$. Then it remains to show that given a point x of X and a map $g: O_{X,x} \to R$, that there is a map f: Spec R -> X such that f(M) = x and such that the induced map is g. I haven't had any luck yet with associating a map f with a given g. Here are my thoughts and some of the things I've tried: When R is a field, then Spec R has only a single point, and thus the map f is completely determined by where it sends the zero ideal. This induces a local homomorphism from $O_{X,x}$ to k, which is to say that it induces a map from $O_{X,x} / M_x \to k$ since the maximal ideal $M_x$ of $O_{X,x}$ is contained in the kernel of the local homomorphism. Anyway, as long as there is some local homomorphism from $O_{X,x}$ to k, then the map f sending (0) to x is a well-defined morphism. Now, when R is again just a local ring, it seems unlikely that f is completely determined by where it sends M, and I can't see how to work with this.

I just need a little hint to get me going again -- I've been thinking about this one for a while and I can't seem to get unstuck.","I am trying to prove the following fact for a homework assignment in algebraic geometry: Let R be a local ring, and X a prescheme. Show that there is a one-one correspondence between R-valued points on X and pairs (x, g) of points x on X and local homomorphisms $g: O_{X, x} \to R$. Now, given f: Spec R -> X, and writing x for f(M) where M is the maximal ideal of R, the induced map on stalks gives us a map $g: O_{X,x} \to R_M = R$. Then it remains to show that given a point x of X and a map $g: O_{X,x} \to R$, that there is a map f: Spec R -> X such that f(M) = x and such that the induced map is g. I haven't had any luck yet with associating a map f with a given g. Here are my thoughts and some of the things I've tried: When R is a field, then Spec R has only a single point, and thus the map f is completely determined by where it sends the zero ideal. This induces a local homomorphism from $O_{X,x}$ to k, which is to say that it induces a map from $O_{X,x} / M_x \to k$ since the maximal ideal $M_x$ of $O_{X,x}$ is contained in the kernel of the local homomorphism. Anyway, as long as there is some local homomorphism from $O_{X,x}$ to k, then the map f sending (0) to x is a well-defined morphism. Now, when R is again just a local ring, it seems unlikely that f is completely determined by where it sends M, and I can't see how to work with this.

74,Discussion of the curve $x^2+y^2+1$ over $\mathbb{R}$,Discussion of the curve  over,x^2+y^2+1 \mathbb{R},"I am currently studying von Szamuelys ""Galois Groups and Fundamental Groups"" and in the chapter 4.3 he discusses the curve $x^2+y^2+1$ over $\mathbb{R}$ via the base change to $\mathbb{C}$ . Since I'm new to algebraic geometry I am having a hard time understanding a few of his statements. Before he discusses this example he defines a integral algebraic curve as the ringed space $(X=Spec(A),\mathcal{O}_X)$ where $A$ is an integral domain of an arbitrary field $k$ with trancendence degree 1. (In this case every prime ideal is maximal). And $\mathcal{O}_X$ is a sheaf of rings on $X$ (equipped with the Zarski Topology) via: $\begin{equation} \mathcal{O}_X(U):=\bigcap_{P \in U}A_p \end{equation}$ for any open U. The closed points of a curve are those maximal ideals that do not contain an ideal I. (I am not sure if this is a common definition, so I repeated it here) When discussing the curve $f=(x^2+y^2+1)$ he considers the $\mathbb{R}$ -curve $X=\operatorname{Spec}(\mathbb{R}[x,y]/(f))$ It is not clear to me how this works with the definition since $A$ was supposed to be an integral domain of a field, but even though $\mathbb{R}[x,y]/(f)$ is a integral domain, it is not part of $\mathbb{R}$ . Is my understanding of the definition wrong? We now conclud that the closed points of $X$ correspond to the maximal ideals of $\mathbb{R}[x,y]$ not containing $(f)$ . Why? shouldent those be the open sets since we factor out f? For each such point we now have $\mathbb{R}[x,y]/M \simeq \mathbb{C} $ because $\mathbb{C}$ is the only nontrivial finite extension of R and X has no points over R. (this is clear) With the base change morphism $X_C \to X$ there are two closed points lying above each closed point of X, (yes) because $\mathbb{C} \otimes_{\mathbb{R}} \mathbb{C} \simeq \mathbb{C} \oplus \mathbb{C}.$ If we make Gal (C|R) act on the tensor product via its action on the second term, then on the right-hand side the resulting action interchanges the components.

Remark 1. In terms of the dual curve, this implies that, if $\operatorname{char}(k)=0$, then $C^{*}$ has no line as a component (because a line in a dual projective space exactly corresponds to the set of lines passing through a given point $P$). Remark 2. The conclusion is false if the characteristic is positive.

I think there should be a satisfactory proof that works for irreducible curves, and just shows finiteness of tangent lines through a given point. Attempt. Let's try the special case when $y=f(x)$ is the equation of the plane algebraic curve. After translating variables, we can assume that $P=(0, 0)$ is the origin. Then every line through the origin has the equation $y=mx$. We want to show that there are only finitely many values of $m$ for which the equation $mx=f(x)$ has a repeated root. This is where we need to use characteristic $0$ assumption. Maybe we can analyze the discriminant? Also, this is just a special case and most curves don't have the form $y=f(x)$. Overkill. I am fairly certain that Bertini's theorem can give the solution immediately. Indeed, the lines through a given point $P$ defines a linear system. This induces a linear system of divisors on the curve $C$ (by intersecting the lines with $C$). Since we are in characteristic $0$, Bertini's theorem guarantees that a general member of this linear series will be non-singular, which just means that a general line through $P$ will intersect the curve at distinct points (i.e. transversely).

Firstly, let me just recall the general case: Given an algebraic variety $X$ over a field $K$ and a geometric point $\bar{x}:\text{Spec}(\bar{K})\to X$ we can consider the category of pointed finite étale covers $Y\to X$. Let's call this category $\mathsf{Cov}(X,\bar{x})$. The fibre functor $\Phi$ on this category associates to each cover $\phi: Y\to X$ the underlying set of the fibre above the geometric point $\bar{x}$ and to each morphism of covers the corresponding function on fibres. The étale fundamental group of $(X,\bar{x})$ is defined as the automorphism group of this functor, and it is a general theorem that it is pro-representable i.e. there's a projective system of étale covers of $X$ that represents $\Phi$. Now I'm able to find many quite abstract proofs of the above pro-representablity theorem (for example, in Szamuely's book it is done for connected schemes). However in the interests of not investing an impossible amount of energy into my project I am looking for a far more basic version: just the case that $X = E$ is an elliptic curve with basepoint $O\in E(K)$. In this case the category $\mathsf{Cov}(E,O)$ actually becomes a category of covers of $E$ by isogenies of elliptic curves (over extensions of $K$) once a point in the fibre above $O$ is chosen, and the fibre functor actually factors through the category of finite abelian groups because it associates to each isogeny its kernel. In this case, one of the nice results I have seen mentioned often is that the fibre functor on $\mathsf{Cov}(E,O)$ is pro-represented by the system of multiplication-by-$m$ isogenies $$ [m]: E\to E$$ (given a partial order by division) which are étale provided $m$ is a unit in $K$ . I haven't been able to find a proof of this specific result anywhere. It's possible one doesn't exist and that a proof using the fully general construction I mentioned above is required, but I would be very happy if anyone out there can correct me and point me in the direction of a proof this result for elliptic curves.
