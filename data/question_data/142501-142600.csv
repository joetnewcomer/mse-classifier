I tried to develop it further but got stuck..","Let $f:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}$ such that $\left|f(x)-f(y)\right| \le \|x-y\|^2$ for every $x,y\in\mathbb{R}^2$. Show that $f$ is constant. So I think that if $f$ is constant then $\nabla f \equiv 0$. Let $(x_0, y_0) \in \mathbb{R}^2$. If $f$ is differentiable at this point then the following limit need to be zero: $$\lim_{(x,y)\to(x_0,y_0)} \left| \frac{f(x,y) - f(x_0,y_0) - \langle \nabla f,(x-x_0,y-y_0)\rangle}{\|(x-x_0,y-y_0)\|} \right| = 0$$ We know that: $$\lim_{(x,y)\to(x_0,y_0)} \left| \frac{f(x,y) - f(x_0,y_0) - \langle \nabla f,(x-x_0,y-y_0)\rangle}{\|(x-x_0,y-y_0)\|} \right| \le \lim_{(x,y)\to (x_0,y_0)} \left| \frac{\|(x-x_0,y-y_0)\|^2 - \langle \nabla f,(x-x_0,y-y_0)\rangle}{\|(x-x_0,y-y_0)\|} \right| $$ Where should I take it from here?

95,Limit of $\frac{n^4+4^n}{n+4^{n+1}}$,Limit of,\frac{n^4+4^n}{n+4^{n+1}},"Just when i  thought i finally got the hang of limits, i stumbled upon this: $$\frac{n^4+4^n}{n+4^{n+1}}$$ Now, this kinda makes sense in my head because $4^n$ grows  a lot faster than $n^4$, let alone $n$. Now my question is if this assumption is a valid tool for solving this limit i.e. if i divide both denominator and numerator with $4^n$, can that be user without further explanation or proof. This, of course, gives the result of $\frac{1}{4}$ which seems to be correct.
