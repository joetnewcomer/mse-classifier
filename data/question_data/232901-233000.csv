6,Definition of a one-to-one correspondence,Definition of a one-to-one correspondence,,"I'm currently reading ""Naive Set Theory"" by P.H.

Can you please point out the mistakes? Thank you all. Let $A$ and $B$ be any set. Prove: $A$ is the disjoint union of $A\setminus B$ and $A\cap B$ $A\cup B$ is the disjoint union of $A\setminus B$, $A\cap B$, and $B\setminus A$. Part 1 Suppose $A$ and $B$ are not disjoint. Then, $$ \{x | x\in A\setminus B\text{ and }x\in A\cap B\} $$ Since $A\subseteq A\setminus B$ and $A\subseteq A\cap B$, $A\setminus B = A\cap B$. So, $A\setminus B\nsubseteq B$, or $A\setminus B\subseteq B^{C}$, and $A\cap B\subseteq B$. Then, $B\cup B^{C} = \emptyset$, and $A$ and $B$ are disjoint. Part 2 Suppose $A\cup B$ is not disjoint. Then, $$ \{x | x\in A\setminus B\text{ and }x\in A\cap B\text{ and }x\in B\setminus A\} $$ $A\setminus B\subseteq B^{C}$, $A\cap B\subseteq A$, $A\cap B\subseteq B$, and $B\setminus A\subseteq A^{C}$. But since $B\cup B^{C} = \emptyset$ and $A\cap A^{C} = \emptyset$, $A\cup B$ is disjoint.",,['elementary-set-theory']

42,Is the set of all linear orders on $\mathbb{N}$ linearly orderable?,Is the set of all linear orders on  linearly orderable?,\mathbb{N},"In studying the issue of linear orders and well ordering in the context of ZF Set Theory (without the Axiom of Choice), I have recently been thinking about the following question: Is the set of all linear orders of $\mathbb{N}$ linearly orderable? It feels as though there may be some way to construct a linear order on this set, perhaps by considering the number generated by the ordering (e.g $1 - 2 - 3 . . .$ would be smaller than $2 - 1 - 3 . . . $ ) but I am struggling to formalise this idea. Also, this feels like an idea that may rely upon the Axiom of Choice (although, again, I am unsure about this). My other idea, is that this is a result that depends upon well ordering (in which case, due to the absence of the Axiom of Choice, would make the answer no). I would be grateful for any clarity here.","In studying the issue of linear orders and well ordering in the context of ZF Set Theory (without the Axiom of Choice), I have recently been thinking about the following question: Is the set of all linear orders of linearly orderable?

49,Number of ways to partition a multiset into $k$ non empty submultisets.,Number of ways to partition a multiset into  non empty submultisets.,k,"Let $A$ be a multiset with $n$ distinct elements where each element occurs exactly twice. How many ways can we partition $A$ into $k$ non-empty (unlabelled) sub multisets (denoted $T(n,k)$ )? My approach would be something similar to the Stirling Numbers. For each element $x \in A$ , we can either both copies of $x$ in a set, or include them in two different sets. Therefore, we can define labelings of sets (parts), as singleton and two-element subsets of $\{1,2,3,...k\}$ . There are in total $k + {{k}\choose{2}} = {{k+1}\choose{2}}$ different labeling we can assign to each element. (Note: We divide the end result by $k!$ because the labeling did not originally matter) Elements where both copies are included in the same set are labeled with a singleton, and if one element occurs in two sets, it is labeled with a two-element set. For example, the partition of $\{\{a,a,c\},\{b,b,c\}\}$ of $\{a,a,b,b,c,c\}$ can be defined by an equivalence class or function such as $f(a)=\{1\}$ , $f(b)=\{2\}$ , $f(c)=\{1,2\}$ . The basic idea is to count the number of functions $f:A_s \xrightarrow{} S$ such that $|\cup_{x \in A_s} f(x)| = k$ . Here, $A_s$ is the set containing only one of each element in $A$ , and $S = \{  s \in \mathcal{P}(\{1,2,3,...k\})\ \mid  |s| = {1,2} \}$ . Since $|S|={{k+1}\choose{2}}$ , and $|A_s|=n$ , we have $|S|^{|A_s|} = {{k+1}\choose{2}}^{n}$ different functions to choose from. However, some functions may not satisfy our initial constraint that $|\cup_{x \in A_s} f(x)| = k$ . We can use inclusion-exclusion for this (similar to how the Stirling Numbers of the Second Kind are derived). What I get is something like $$ T(n,k) = \frac{1}{k!} \sum_{i=0}^{k} (-1)^{k-i} {{k}\choose{i}} {{i+1}\choose{2}}^n $$ I think the formula is wrong though, and I can't figure out why. For example, with $k=2$ , we have $T(n,2) = \frac{1}{2}(3^n - 2)$ . I know that it should be $\frac{1}{2}(3^n - 1)$ because each subset of $A$ has a complement, but one set is its own complement, and we need to ""add"" a pair to the collection, then divide by 2. For $k=3$ , we have $T(n,k) = \frac{1}{6}(6^n - 3^{n+1} + 3)$ , but manual computations show that this is incorrect. (For example, $T(3,3) = 23$ , but it should be $26$ , and $T(4,3) = 176$ , but it should be $183$ ). Could anyone please kindly give me hints on what I am missing here. I am really trying to figure it out on my own, or at least understand why my computations are incorrect? Thanks in advance! Edit: I realized my mistake (thanks to user2661923). So basically, I had the counting correct, but for ordered partitions rather than unordered partitions. Basically, if we forget the ordering, some partitions have $k!$ copies, others have fewer than $k!$ duplicates.  So all we need to do to fix the counting is ""add"" enough duplicates (for those permutations that have fewer than $k!$ copies). For example, if $k=2$ using the formula above (ignore the $\frac{1}{k!}$ ), we get $T(n,k) = 3^n-2$ . However, there will be one partition of the form $\{X, X\}$ (where $X$ is a multiset). There is only one copy of this partition included, so we need to ""add"" in another copy of it, leading to $3^n-1$ , instead of $3^n-2$ , which we can then divide by 2, to get the correct value of $T(n,2) = (3^n-1)/2$ If $k=3$ , then we initally get $T(n,3) = 6^n - 3^{n+1} + 3$ . Partitions of the form $\{X,X,Y\}$ only have $3$ copies included, so we need to ""add"" three more. Each element is either assigned to $\{X,X\}$ or $\{Y\}$ , but all cannot be assigned the same sets, so this yields $2^n-2$ different copies we need to add (don't forget that this gives $3$ additional copies). Since we originally had $3$ different labels, we need to multiply this result by $3$ . This gives $$T(n,3) = (6^n - 3^{n+1} + 3 + 3(2^n-2))/6 = (6^n - 3^{n+1} + (3)2^n - 3)/6$$ The case for $k=4$ is more complicated, but after manually checking all possible partitions which need extra copies, I get the formula: $$T(n,4) = (10^n - (4)6^n + (6)4^n - (9)2^n + 8)/24$$ I'm not putting this as an answer because I am still not sure of a general formula that doesn't involve manually checking all possible partitions which are initially undercounted.","Let be a multiset with distinct elements where each element occurs exactly twice.

Let $G$ be the connected graph and consider the set of all tress denoted by $S$ . This set $S$ under subgraph relation $\subset$ is a partially ordered set $(S,\subset)$ . Any chain $C$ of the poset is a chain of tress with respect to inclusion relation. Then, the union of $A=\cup\ T_i$ where $T_i \in C$ $i \in \{1,2,3,....,n\}$ is the upper bound of the chain $C$ . Suppose $A$ is not a tree. Then $A$ is either disconnected or there is cycle present. Suppose $A$ is disconnected then there are two vertices $x, y \in A$ such that there is no path between them. Let $x \in T_x$ and $y \in T_y$ and $T_x , T_y \in A.$ Since $T_x$ and $T_y$ is in chain $C$ (because $A$ is the upper bound of $C$ ) either $T_x \subset T_y$ or $T_y \subset T_x$ and in either cases $x$ must be connected to $y$ in the bigger tree.

Improve this question I'd like to show that if I'd like to understand the way I am suppose to approach set theory challenges. Since this is not something intuitive I don't know where to start when approaching such challenges. Apart from not being sure how to start, since there is a I suppose that I need to provide in both directions, am I correct? Please help with the right reasoning for this proof.

My hunch tells me it is only uncountable. Obviously $F:\mathbb R\to S$ given by: $$F(x)(t)=f_x(t)=\begin{cases}x,&t=1,\\0, & t \not = 1\end{cases}$$ is a well defined injection. For other injection, I thought of mappings such as: $$f \mapsto\left(\sum_{f(x)\not = 0}e^x,\sum_{f(x)\not = 0}e^{|x|},\sum_{f(x)\not =0}e^{-x},\sum_{f(x)\not = 0}f(x),\prod_{f(x)\not = 0}f(x)\right)$$ but I am not sure if $f$ is an injection or not. Any hint would be appreciated.","I am looking for cardinality of set . My hunch tells me it is only uncountable. Obviously given by: is a well defined injection.
