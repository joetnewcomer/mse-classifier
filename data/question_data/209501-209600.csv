5,Characterizing a Recursively Defined Rational Set [duplicate],Characterizing a Recursively Defined Rational Set [duplicate],,"This question already has answers here : What is the set generate by ${1}$ and a function $1/(a+b)$? (2 answers) Closed 3 months ago . Let $S$ be the smallest set of rational numbers that contains $\tfrac{1}{2}$ , as well as the reciprocal of the sum of any two elements that are already in $S$ . Prove or disprove that $S=\mathbb{Q} \cap [\tfrac{1}{2},1]$ Note that the two elements may be identical. This is a repost of my previous post, which was answered partially as follows by @Tony Matthew (which I agree with): Partial answer Let's try building the set $S$ by starting with $\frac{1}{2}$ and adding new elements by taking two elements from the current set and calculating $f(a,b) \equiv \frac{1}{a + b}$ . One possible value for $S$ is the steady-state limit of this process. Since $\frac{1}{2}$ is the only element initially, the next new element must be $f(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}) = 1$ , so that our set becomes $\left\lbrace\frac{1}{2}, 1\right\rbrace$ . Then, $f(1,1) = \frac{1}{2}, f(\frac{1}{2},1) = \frac{2}{3}$ , so the set next grows to $\left\lbrace\frac{1}{2}, \frac{2}{3}, 1\right\rbrace$ . Now the induction hypothesis: if the elements of the set lie between $\frac{1}{2}$ and $1$ , then so too will any new element generated via $f(a,b)$ . This can be proven by the following, $$\frac{1}{2}\leq a,b \leq 1 \rightarrow 1 \leq a + b \leq 2 \rightarrow \frac{1}{2}\leq f(a,b) \leq 1$$ Hence, since the set has started within the bounds of $\frac{1}{2}$ and $1$ , it will remain within those bounds, and so too $S$ . Therefore, since each new element must be a rational number, $$S \subseteq \mathbb{Q} \cap [\tfrac{1}{2},1]$$ I find this problem similar to that of the Calkin–Wilf tree, except the condition that two parent elements generate one child element is a bit more difficult to handle. In comments: For example, to obtain 5/7 I would try to find two elements such that their sum is 7/5, such as 3/5 and 4/5. These can generated by (2/3,1) and (3/4,1/2). 1 is generated by (1/2,1/2), 2/3 is generated by (1/2,1), 3/4 is generated by (2/3,2/3).","This question already has answers here : What is the set generate by ${1}$ and a function $1/(a+b)$?

As an example, if $|a_i-i| = 4$ , then $a_1 = 5, a_2 = 6,, a_3 = 7, a_4 = 8,$ and $a_5 = 9$ or $1$ . But I'm not sure how to get a contradiction from this. Note that once we show (1), it is easy to show that there are no interesting nonidentity permutations if $n$ is odd since $n = \sum_{i=1}^n (a_i-i) = 0\mod 2$ for any interesting nonidentity permutation. Edit: the original proof seems like it can be modified slightly to solve the general case. First, we'll prove more formally that permutations get split into cycles of length $2k$ . We indeed have that for $1\leq i\leq k, |a_i - i| = k$ implies that $a_i = i+k$ since $a_i = i-k$ is impossible ( $a_i$ is positive). For $2k+1\leq i, |a_i - i| = k\Rightarrow a_i \ge k+1,$ and hence for $k+1\leq i\leq 2k,$ we must have $a_i = i-k.$ Then $\{1,\cdots, 2k\} = \{a_1,\cdots, a_{2k}\}.$ We claim that the statement P(x) holds where P(x) states that $\{x(2k) + 1,\cdots, (x+1)(2k)\} = \{a_{x(2k)+1},\cdots, a_{(x+1)(2k)}\}$ for all $x\ge 0$ (and we trim the indices if they're out of bounds or we can extend the permutation past n by ignoring extra elements). Assuming that $P(y)$ holds for all $y < x, x\ge 1$ , we then have for $1\leq i\leq k, a_{(x+1)(2k)+i} = (x+1)(2k)+i + k$ since $(x+1)(2k)+i-k$ was already taken by some other elements by the inductive hypothesis. Also, for $k+1\leq i\leq 2k, a_{(x+1)(2k)+i} = (x+1)(2k)+i-k$ since none of these elements can be achieved by other $a_i$ 's using similar reasoning to the base case. Hence by induction we have that $P(y)$ always holds provided y is in range and so for an interesting permutation we must have $2k | n$ (note that at any point in the construction, we also have $\{x(2k) + 1,\cdots, x(2k)+i\} \not\subseteq\{a_{x(2k)+1},\cdots, a_{x(2k)+i}\}$ for any $1\leq i < 2k$ so the permutation wouldn't be surjective if it were cut short because $2k\not\div n$ . This would be shown more formally by adding this claim to the inductive hypothesis). The above proof also shows that for an even divisor $2k$ of $n$ , the permutation satisfying $|a_i-i| = k$ for all i is in fact unique (well technically we need to add this assumption to the inductive hypothesis but that's it); hence the result.","A permutation of is called interesting if is a constant for all i.

61,Every graph has a large min-degree subgraph,Every graph has a large min-degree subgraph,,"If a graph has large minimum degree, i.e. everywhere, locally, many edges per vertex, it also has many edges per vertex globally: $\varepsilon(G)=$ $\frac{1}{2} d(G) \geqslant \frac{1}{2} \delta(G)$ . Conversely, of course, its average degree may be large even when its minimum degree is small. However, the vertices of large degree cannot be scattered completely among vertices of small degree: as the next proposition shows, every graph $G$ has a subgraph whose average degree is no less than the average degree of $G$ , and whose minimum degree is more than half its average degree:। Proposition 1.2.2. Every graph $G$ with at least one edge has a subgraph $H$ with $\delta(H)>\varepsilon(H) \geqslant \varepsilon(G)$ . Proof. To construct $H$ from $G$ , let us try to delete vertices of small degree one by one, until only vertices of large degree remain. Up to which degree $d(v)$ can we afford to delete a vertex $v$ , without lowering $\varepsilon$ ? Clearly, up to $d(v)=\varepsilon$ : then the number of vertices decreases by 1 and the number of edges by at most $\varepsilon$ , so the overall ratio $\varepsilon$ of edges to vertices will not decrease. Formally, we construct a sequence $G=G_{0} \supseteq G_{1} \supseteq \ldots$ of induced subgraphs of $G$ as follows. If $G_{i}$ has a vertex $v_{i}$ of degree $d\left(v_{i}\right) \leqslant \varepsilon\left(G_{i}\right)$ , we let $G_{i+1}:=G_{i}-v_{i}$ ; if not, we terminate our sequence and set $H:=G_{i}$ . By the choices of $v_{i}$ we have $\varepsilon\left(G_{i+1}\right) \geqslant \varepsilon\left(G_{i}\right)$ for all $i$ , and hence $\varepsilon(H) \geqslant \varepsilon(G)$ . What else can we say about the graph $H$ ? Since $\varepsilon\left(K^{1}\right)=0<\varepsilon(G)$ , none of the graphs in our sequence is trivial, so in particular $H \neq \emptyset$ . The fact that $H$ has no vertex suitable for deletion thus implies $\delta(H)>\varepsilon(H)$ , as claimed. Precisely, what does it mean by saying ""the vertices of large degree cannot be scattered completely among vertices of small degree""?

Conversely, of course, its average degree may be large even when its minimum degree is small. However, the vertices of large degree cannot be scattered completely among vertices of small degree: as the next proposition shows, every graph has a subgraph whose average degree is no less than the average degree of , and whose minimum degree is more than half its average degree:। Proposition 1.2.2. Every graph with at least one edge has a subgraph with . Proof. To construct from , let us try to delete vertices of small degree one by one, until only vertices of large degree remain. Up to which degree can we afford to delete a vertex , without lowering ? Clearly, up to : then the number of vertices decreases by 1 and the number of edges by at most , so the overall ratio of edges to vertices will not decrease. Formally, we construct a sequence of induced subgraphs of as follows. If has a vertex of degree , we let ; if not, we terminate our sequence and set . By the choices of we have for all , and hence . What else can we say about the graph ? Since , none of the graphs in our sequence is trivial, so in particular . The fact that has no vertex suitable for deletion thus implies , as claimed.

94,Is the independence number of the (strong) product of two graphs equal to the product of the independence numbers?,Is the independence number of the (strong) product of two graphs equal to the product of the independence numbers?,,"Consider two graphs $G=(V,E)$ and $H=(W,F)$ . For the sake of simplicity, say that both $G$ and $H$ contain all self-loops. Let $N_G(v)$ and $N_H(w)$ be the first neighborhoods of any vertex $v\in V$ (in $G$ ) and $w\in W$ (in $H$ ), respectively. Then the strong product $G\boxtimes H$ of $G$ and $H$ is a graph with set of nodes $V\times W$ in which a pair $(v,w)\in V\times W$ is adjacent to another one $(v',w')\in V \times W$ if and only if $(v,w) \in N_G(v')\times N_H(w')$ . It is easy to see that the independence number $\alpha(G\boxtimes H)$ of $G\boxtimes H$ is always larger than or equal to the product $\alpha(G)\alpha(H)$ of the independence numbers $\alpha(G)$ of $G$ and $\alpha(H)$ of $H$ . This is because the Cartesian product $I\times J$ of an independent set $I$ in $G$ with an independent set $J$ in $H$ is an independent set in $G\boxtimes H$ . I assume it is not always the case that $\alpha(G\boxtimes H) = \alpha(G)\alpha(H)$ (not even up to constants) because I keep finding the upper bound $\alpha(G\boxtimes H) \le \alpha^\star(G)\alpha(H)$ , where $\alpha^\star(G)$ is the fractional packing (or Rosenfeld) number of $G$ , which I know can be much bigger than $\alpha(G)$ . This got me wondering: Question: Is it possible that $\alpha(G\boxtimes H) \gg \alpha(G)\alpha(H)$ ?

96,Is this idea for solving multivariable recurrences close to correct?,Is this idea for solving multivariable recurrences close to correct?,,"According to Wikipedia , the binomial coefficient identity offers a good example of a multivariable recurrence relation.  I believe the idea is to treat the top and bottom slots of the choose operator each as an input to an unknown function, leading to the equation $$C[n,\ k] = C[n - 1,\ k - 1] + C[n - 1,\ k]$$ where we pretend not to know in advance that $C$ is the choose operator.  My goal is to try to solve this analytically by extrapolating from the patterns relating discrete and continuous equations in the single variable case. First, I shifted some things to get $C[n + 1,\ k + 1] - C[n,\ k + 1] - C[n,\ k] = 0$ , and considered the most similar partial differential equation, $c_{_{NK}} - c_{_K} - c = 0$ , where $c$ , $N$ , and $K$ are the continuous versions of $C$ , $n$ , and $k$ , respectively.  This was based on the observation that incrementing inputs and taking derivatives have the same effect on the characteristic equation in linear, single variable equations. Next, I tried to solve the partial differential equation using separation of variables.  This led to $c = (Ae^{\frac{1}{\lambda} N})(Be^{\lambda K + K})$ , where $A$ and $B$ are the arbitrary constants from each separated ODE. Finally, I want to get rid of the exponential nature of the solution and write the solution to the discrete equation.  The most natural thing for me to write based on the single variable pattern is $$C = a(\frac{1}{\Lambda})^n b(\Lambda + 1)^k$$ I just yeeted the $e$ from each factor and pulled the coefficients of the independent variables down (and switched the case of each letter again for clarity of notation).  I'm not sure if $a$ and $b$ can be lumped, since they may have been affected by two different discretizations. Actually, I'm not sure if any of this is valid.
