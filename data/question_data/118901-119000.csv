I'm a statistician by schooling, and never did great with geometry. The circle is a region ~38.4 square km area centered around a GHCN weather station. The points inside the circle are evenly spread, and they represent locations where precipitation values were interpolated using ordinary Kriging, the height associated with each point (shown in the second picture) is the precipitation value in 10mm increments. The goal is measuring the volume of precipitation over that circular region. My initial, and what I assumed was going to be error prone, method involved dividing the total area of the circular region by the number of points in the grid, taking that value as the area for the region centered around each point. The height at this point was multiplied the the area, and all of the resulting volumes were summed. (Henning, I think this is similar to what you proposed in the comments.) However, I figured there was a better method out there that I might be able to implement in R or matlab.

The second picture was just a quick 3D plot I made in R to help visualize what one such polyhedron could look like. That was when I posted here. Studiosus- your solution seems rather promising because I think I could easily define the edges, faces, and vertices. As for reorienting them and doing the integration...do you have any resources you could point me to where I could read up on how that all works? I'm not sure I could dive in an code a function to do all of that quite yet. Heimdall and JeanMarie- this solution seems perfect, and quite easy to implement computationally. To make sure I didn't gloss over anything, I would sum the 4 heights for each 2x2 square, divide by 4, and multiply by the area of the square (as the formula given uses a unit square). Do this for each square and sum. Right? If so, this seems like my best bet. Follow up question: some boundary cases crop up where I have 3 points making a triangular base. The volume for these would be computed by slicing the object as a triangular prism, with height equal to the shortest of the 3 heights, and the remaining object would be a tetrahedron.

First issue is that I know almost no geometry. Besides calculating areas of basic shapes,and a few very very basic theorems about chords and circles,I am a blank slate. Second issue I have is that I can not handle non-axiomatic arguments,which are laid out in many good books.It is not that I find them bad or anything,I just like precision. So now I will list few points which a book should satisfy,and then I will list a few examples of books which do not satisfy,and why. Firstly book or book series should contain both plane a 3D geometry(or however it is called). Exercises should be abundant(not essential) The more theorems proved in the text,the better. It should start from scratch.Namely from basic axioms, be it Euclidean or Hilbert or any other axiomatization.Then it should proceed from these axioms,and using strictly them,prove theorems.For reference think of Enderton's Set Theory book,first it lays out the axioms and then proceeds to results, given book should proceed in similar manner. Any terms used used should be previously or timely defined It should start from very basic concepts,like lines,circles,angles and etc. and proceed up to higher concepts,whatever they may be. Now for books which do not satisfy and why. First example is Kiselev's Planimetry and Stereometry. These two books are great, but lack of rigor is very frustrating. Hartshorne's Geometry book is great according to reviews but my problem with it is that it assumes knowledge which I do not posses. Same goes for Coxeter.

39,Is the square-wheeled tricycle at MoMath stable?,Is the square-wheeled tricycle at MoMath stable?,,"My question has to do with the geometry of the square-wheeled tricycle ride Pedal on the Petals at the National Musuem of Mathematics in New York (MoMath). The tricycles ride on a circular track (see video or pictures below), whose surface forms what I might call a fanned catenary. Note that the inner wheels of the tricycles are smaller squares than the outer wheels, in order that they fit the smaller track length there. Note also that the two rear wheels each have their own axle, and the smaller inner wheel axle is correspondingly lower, although they are geared so that they turn together at the same angular rate. Thus, the two wheels turn in unison, with their corners sinking into the crevices between the catenary pieces at the same time. Another detail is that the turn angle of the tricycle is fixed — the rider cannot steer. The point of the exhibit, of course, is that despite the square wheels and bumpy road, the tricycles offer a smooth ride around the course. Each axle stays the same distance above the floor as it turns, because the uneven track exactly makes up for the change in the radius of the square as it turns. My question has to do with the observation that each tricycle operates properly only at a certain fixed radius from the center of the track, namely, the radius at which the circumference of the wheels matches that of the track surface. If you look in the photos, you can see that this radius is marked on the track with a solid red center line for the front wheel and dashed lines for the rear wheels. The wheels have a rubber surface that does not slip on the surface of the track. Question. Is the geometry of this arrangement stable under small perturbations? In other words, it seems inevitable that the tricycles will get bumped in some way or pushed a little off their line, and then the wheels will no longer exactly fit the track. Will the precise way that they don't fit tend to force them back onto the track properly?  And what if the fixed angle of the steering is a little off? Will the operation of the tricycle simply force it back into place? Looking at the operation of the exhibit in practice, it seems to be fairly stable, and I have never seen a rider simply get stuck. I asked the guy running the exhibit at MoMath, but he made only a non-committal answer, although he did suggest that it might be at least a little stable. I am hoping that someone with a strong geometrical sense will be able to explain to me why the tricycles seem to operate smoothly even when subject to random forces of kids jostling them.","My question has to do with the geometry of the square-wheeled tricycle ride Pedal on the Petals at the National Musuem of Mathematics in New York (MoMath).

More specifically, let $D \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ be an origin-centered disk of radius $r$. Let $x = (x_1, x_2), y = (y_1, y_2) \in C$. We wish to show that for any $\lambda \in [0, 1]$, the point $z$ given by $$     z = \lambda x + (1 - \lambda) y = (\lambda x_1 + (1 - \lambda y_1), \lambda x_2 + (1 - \lambda) y_2) $$ also lies in $D$.

Edit: Solution using Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality Even though I used the notation for norms, it didn't occur to me to just use the triangle inequality, as Dustan Levenstein suggested.

The solution would then proceed as follows: \begin{align*}     \| \lambda x + (1 - \lambda) y \|_2     &\leq \lambda \| x \|_2 + (1 - \lambda) \| y \|_2 \\     &\leq \lambda r + (1 - \lambda) r = r. \end{align*} It follows that $\| z \|_2^2 \leq r^2$, as desired. I'm still going to leave the question up, in case there's a solution that does not rely on the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.",,"['geometry', 'convex-analysis', 'circles']"

It seems to me that he used his prior knowledge of the value of the area to continue the proof, which leaves the reader wondering where he got the value from.

However, how can we add another cube to this with minimal volume increase in the larger cube? I came up with an answer that is less than the obvious $27cm^3$ . What I did was trying to reduce the problem to 2 dimensions and think of how large does a unit square has to be so that I can fit 5 unit squares in it. Well, I can put four squares in the corners of the larger square and I can fit a square in the middle with the vertices of those squares touching the middle of the side of the central square (I attached my drawing to represent it). This gives a side of the square measuring $(2 + \sqrt2/2)cm$ (simple calculation). This is less than the obvious answer of $3cm$ .

Both triangles are right-angled and T has twice the area of U . What is the perimeter of T ? I can calculate what $b$ is, but cannot get any further. Any help would be appreciated. How I calculate $b$ : If we assume that $a$ is the shortest side of T , and that $b$ is the other side of the right-angle. Then $c$ must be the hypotenuse, and therefore longest side. Therefore, on U , $\dfrac{1}{c}$ must now be the shortest side, $\dfrac{1}{a}$ is the longest and $\dfrac{1}{b}$ is the ""middle"". Lets call A the opposite angle of $a$ and F the opposite of $\dfrac{1}{c}$ . Using sohcahtoa we can then deduce that $$\sin{A} = \dfrac{a}{c}$$ and $$\sin {F} = \frac{\dfrac{1}{c}}{\dfrac{1}{a}} = \frac{a}{c}$$ therefore the triangles are similar. Also because we are given that $$A(T) = 2\cdot A(U)$$ we know that $a=\frac{1}{c}\sqrt{2}$ and $b=\frac{1}{b}\sqrt{2}$ . the latter then allows us to calculate $b$ , which is is the 4th root of 2. Other worthy things to note: Using $$\text{Area of triangle} = \dfrac{1}{2} \:(\text{base} \times \text{height})$$ we get $$A(T)= \frac{1}{2}(ab)$$ and $$A(U) = \frac{1}{2bc}$$ therefore $$b^2 = \frac{2}{ac}$$ Also, since the triangles are similar, the ratio of $a/b$ must be the same as $(1/c) / (1/b)$ , thus $b^2 = ac$ .  Combining these gives $ac = 2 / ac$ .

I have the following intuition about the associated bundle $L_2 \rightarrow P\times_G L_2 \rightarrow M$ . Suppose in above we have a principal $G$ -bundle $P$ and for some reason we are interested to replace the fibers that are diffeomorphic to $L_1$ , with new fibers that are diffeomorphic to $L_2$ . How could we do this? I was intuitively thinking that if somehow $L_2$ could have been embedded inside $L_1$ , then as in the quotient manifold theorem, if $L_2$ represents the quotient space $L_1/G$ for some action $\sigma$ , then we might be able to somehow do this: we get rid of the redundant information in each fiber $L_1$ to reduce the already given fiber to something diffeomorphic to $L_2$ . But not always do we find ourselves in a situation where $L_2$ could sit inside $L_1$ via an embedding. So, what could we do in these cases? I think this is why we first consider the bigger fibers $P_x \times L_2$ at each $x \in M$ and build the fiber bundle $P\times L_2$ ; To somehow fit $L_2$ in a bigger space that is also related to $L_1$ . Then by defining an equivalence relation on this product fibers, we should be able to kill the info of $L_1$ and thus successfully replace our fibers with things that are $L_2$ . We can do this by the trivial equivalence relation $(a_1, b) \sim (a_2, b)$ for any $a_1, a_2 \in P_x$ and $b \in L$ but this is very trivial and probably wouldn't give us something interesting. So we move on to something that really engages $L_1$ and $L_2$ together and twists and curves the fibers nontrivially so that we get something cool! We can define an equivalence relation on it by demanding $(a.g, b) \sim (a, g.b)$ for $a \in P, b \in L_2$ and $g \in G$ . Here $a.g$ is given by the right transitive action of $G$ on the leaves of the principal bundle. Also $g.b$ is nothing but $\sigma_g(b)$ from the left effective action of $G$ on $L_2$ . The theorem in the associated bundle tells us that after quotienting over this equivalence relation, we obtain the new $G$ -fiber bundle $P\times_GL_2$ which has now fibers diffeomorphic to $L_2$ . My question is, although the statement of the theorem is saying that the information of the leaves of $P$ that were diffeomorphic to $L_1$ are gone and it only leaves us with the info of $L_2$ , I can't see why is this happening intuitively! The equivalence relation $(a.g, b) \sim (a, g.b)$ seems to treat $L_1$ and $L_2$ very symmetrically. Why is this then that in the end of the day the info of $L_1$ are lost after quotienting but the info of $L_2$ remains? I figure it has something to do with the effectiveness of the action $\sigma$ but for the longest time I haven't figured it out how is this helping?

88,How does the water level rise when you fill a hemispherical bowl at constant volumetric flow rate?,How does the water level rise when you fill a hemispherical bowl at constant volumetric flow rate?,,"This is a question that occurred to me when actually filling such a bowl. I saw this post , which however does not seem to give a final formula for the water level/height vs time. Here is how I approached it (and why I still have a doubt about it). Knowing (e.g. from here ) that the filled volume as a function of the sphere's radius $r$ and cap height (= water level) $h$ is: $$V = \frac {\pi h^2} 3 (3 r - h)$$ and assuming that the volumetric flow rate is $F$ , at a time $t$ , the volume of water must be: $$V = F t$$ Equating the two: $$F t = \frac {\pi h^2} 3 (3 r - h)$$ Solving this equation for $h$ should give the desired $h(t)$ . However, the expression I got was very complicated, so I tried some simplifications.

In this way, for $A$ and $B$ , I got the following equations respectively- $$3x \sin \alpha + 2y \cos \alpha -3 \sqrt{5}\sin \alpha=0 \qquad(1)$$ $$3x \sin \alpha + 2y \cos \alpha +3 \sqrt{5}\sin \alpha=0 \qquad(2)$$ Then I found that the line $(1)$ intersects the line $2x \cos \alpha - 3y \sin \alpha = 6$ at point $$P\left ( \frac{9\sqrt5 \sin^2 \alpha+12 \cos \alpha}{4 \cos^2 \alpha + 9 \sin^2 \alpha}, \frac{-18 \sin \alpha+6\sqrt{5} \sin \alpha \cos \alpha}{4 \cos^2 \alpha + 9 \sin^2 \alpha} \right )$$ and the line $(2)$ intersects the line $2x \cos \alpha - 3y \sin \alpha = 6$ at point $$Q\left ( \frac{-9\sqrt5 \sin^2 \alpha+12 \cos \alpha}{4 \cos^2 \alpha + 9 \sin^2 \alpha}, \frac{-18 \sin \alpha-6\sqrt{5} \sin \alpha \cos \alpha}{4 \cos^2 \alpha + 9 \sin^2 \alpha} \right )$$ Now using distance formula $$AP = \sqrt{ \left ( \frac{9\sqrt5 \sin^2 \alpha+12 \cos \alpha}{4 \cos^2 \alpha + 9 \sin^2 \alpha}- \sqrt5 \right )^2 + \left ( \frac{-18 \sin \alpha+6\sqrt{5} \sin \alpha \cos \alpha}{4 \cos^2 \alpha + 9 \sin^2 \alpha} \right )^2}$$ and $$ BQ= \sqrt{ \left ( \frac{-9\sqrt5 \sin^2 \alpha+12 \cos \alpha}{4 \cos^2 \alpha + 9 \sin^2 \alpha} +\sqrt5 \right )^2 + \left ( \frac{-18 \sin \alpha-6\sqrt{5} \sin \alpha \cos \alpha}{4 \cos^2 \alpha + 9 \sin^2 \alpha} \right )^2}$$ Now the multiplication product $AP \cdot BQ$ indeed gives a constant value of $4$ which is free of the arbitrary variable $\alpha$ as you can see here is the simplified version of product of those two quantity. But this is tedious and I do not think this is the only way to do it and an appropriate way to follow in exam with limited time. So, I am looking for an alternative, time saving proof of it. I was wondering if using parametric form would help me, but I think it would get as difficult equally. I created a visualisation for you on desmos to help my problem understand better.","Suppose, is equation of a variable straight line.

97,term for polyhedra whose face normals intersect the center,term for polyhedra whose face normals intersect the center,,"When doing certain things with polyhedra, like applying Conway's operations or developing frame models for 3D printing , it's helpful to know whether all the faces face directly away from the center of the polyhedron. In other words, would a line passing through the center of the polyhedron and the center of each face be perpendicular to that face? I've looked through terms for characteristics and symmetries of polyhedra such as here and here , and I don't see a term for that characteristic. For brevity, let's call this characteristic Y for purposes of this question. regular: too narrow. Archimedean solids appear to be Y but not regular. orthohedral: This set of articles defines orthohedral as having ""all faces... equidistant from the center."" I'm pretty sure this is too narrow as well, because it would exclude an Archimedean truncated tetrahedron . uniform: defined as having ""regular polygons as faces and is vertex-transitive"". This is closer, but again, I'm pretty sure it's too narrow. For example, the pseudorhombicuboctahedron (a Johnson solid) is Y but isn't uniform. A simpler example of a non-uniform Y polyhedron would be a rectangular cuboid. Archimedian: If defined as a subset of uniform polyhedra, this is also too narrow. Even if defined more weakly to include pseudo-uniform polyhedra, it excludes most rectangular cuboids. Catalan solid: a brief look at these suggests that they may all be Y. (But Catalan solids don't include all Y polyhedra.) Johnson solid: Too broad (and too narrow, unless it's defined as including uniform polyhedra). Plenty of Johnson solids, such as J7 , are not Y. canonical: All edges equidistant from the center.

Which raises the point that in order to answer this question, one has to first specify what ""center"" of the polyhedron one has in mind as well as what we mean by the center of each face. Using circumcenter for both might give us a well-defined way to answer this question: Y is equivalent to circumscribable (if that's always true). So far, I have been using the arithmetic mean of the vertices as the center of each face and each polyhedron. That seems to work out fine for (true or pseudo) uniform polyhedra. And it has this advantage: For an operation like expansion , in which the faces ""are separated and moved radially apart,"" the center that faces are moving away from would have to be inside the polyhedron. Which isn't always true of the circumcenter. So, the question is, is there a term for Y (for some reasonable definition of 'center' of face and polyhedron)?

98,Show that $3$ lines must concur,Show that  lines must concur,3,"I was recently posed with the following problem: Let $\Omega$ be a circle passing through vertices $B$ and $C$ in triangle $\Delta ABC$ and let $\omega$ be a circle tangent to segments $AB$ and $AC$ at the points $P$ and $Q$ respectively, and externally tangent to $\Omega$ at point $T$ . Let $M$ be the midpoint of arc $BTC$ of $\Omega$ . Show that lines $BC$ , $PQ$ , and $MT$ concur. Naturally, I first made a quick sketch of the problem: I then quickly realised that in order for $\Omega$ to pass through both $B$ and $C$ , its centre must lie on their perpendicular bisector. This also quickly leads to finding $M$ , as it is simply the point where $\Omega$ intersects this perpendicular bisector. I then managed to loosely show that $T$ has to be on the angular bisector of $\angle BAC$ , i.e. the point where $\Omega$ intersects with this angular bisector. This also very simply shows that $P$ and $Q$ must be the same distance away from $A$ , or in other words, that the triangle $\Delta PQA$ is isosceles. With this information, I made a new, more accurate diagram: I then started trying to prove the statement in the original problem. Since we know $M$ and $T$ , and we know $BC$ , we can now find the point where the three lines must concur. Then, since we know that $\Delta PQA$ is isosceles, my idea was that we could find the point of concurrence, and draw a line from it to $\Delta ABC$ , such that it would make an isosceles triangle at the points where it intersects with the triangle, and check if those points are $P$ and $Q$ (the points of tangency with the circle). If they are, then we have proved it to be true, since $P$ and $Q$ make a line to the point of concurrence, otherwise, it is false. This is where I got stuck, I don't know how I would go about finding this line from the point of concurrence to $\Delta ABC$ , or how I would then go about showing that it intersects at $P$ and $Q$ specifically. I pondered this for a few days but couldn't think of anything, so I decided to ask it here. All help is greatly appreciated! EDIT: it turns out a claim I made earlier was wrong, $T$ does not have to lie on the angular bisector as @user10354138 pointed out EDIT: I also had another finding I forgot to include in my original question.
