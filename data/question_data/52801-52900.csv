Letting $f(n)$ be the number fixed for given $n$ : $$\begin{array}{c | c | c | c | c | c | c | c | } n & 500 & 5000 & 50000 &  500000 & 1000000 & 2000000 \\ \hline f(n) & 82 &  614 & 4843 & 39072 & 74195  & 141777 \end{array}$$ For comparison, $n$ and $\pi(n)$ (number of primes not exceeding $n$ ) are: $$\begin{array}{c | c | c | c | c | c | c | c |} n & 500 & 5000 & 50000 &  500000 & 1000000 & 2000000  \\ \hline \pi(n) & 95 & 669 & 5133 & 41538 & 78498 & 148933 \end{array}$$ and the ratio $f(n)/\pi(n)$ at least for the numbers above appears to approach 1. So my question is whether this might be an indirect consequence of the prime number theorem? Edit: This process seems to approximate the number of primes on intervals generally. For example, if we sort the prime gaps from $g_{120000}$ to $g_{127000}$ , 556 are fixed. And $\pi(127000) - \pi(120000) = 600.$ So maybe a better way of putting the question is, why might it be true that $$ f(g_m,g_{m+1},...,g_k) \approx \pi(k) - \pi(m)?$$ Some things I have looked at. The prime number theorem gives us that $(g_n)$ is not monotone. I don't have an idea to support the suggestion that $f(n)/n \sim 1/\log n.$ If the probability (loosely speaking) that $g_k = \hat{g_k}$ is $1/\log n$ then maybe this can be explained in terms of the multiplicity, in some average sense, of $g_k$ in a particular finite sequence of gaps. It occurs to me that if the number of gaps less than $n$ of size (say) 2 is $k(n),$ it is not possible to understand the probabilities involved without knowing whether $k(n)$ is bounded as $n$ gets large. So maybe the idea can be shown to be incorrect but showing it to be correct might require answering the threshold question about gaps. Taking the suggestion above as true, assuming infinite gaps of all lengths (a conjecture of Polignac) and letting $c_k(n)$ be the number of prime gaps of length $k$ for given $n,$ if we assume also something akin to a well-distributed property in the distribution of gaps of length $k$ (which follows in a qualified way from a conjecture of Hardy-Littlewood $^1$ ) we have a simplification of notation based on geometry: $$ f(n) \approx S = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k = 1}^{n} c_k(n)^2\approx \frac{n}{\log n}.$$ If nothing else, the expression conveys the idea of an average. While it doesn't seem fortuitous I cannot justify it. Some numbers: $$\begin{array}{c | c | c |c | }  n & S & \pi(n) & S/ \pi(n)  \\ \hline 100 & 21.01  & 25 &0.8404  \\ \hline 1000 & 145.13 & 168 &0.8638\\    \hline  10000 & 1071.45 & 1229 &0.8718\\ \hline 100000 &8562.17& 9592& 0.8926 \\ \hline  \end{array}$$ Edit: Looking carefully at @Sophie's comment below, I get comparable results and so I think it is correct.

In other words, the $100$ rooms are identical with respect to the boxes and real numbers. Knowing the rooms are identical, $100$ mathematicians play a game.  After a time for discussing strategy, the mathematicians will simultaneously be sent to different rooms, not to communicate with one another again.  While in the rooms, each mathematician may open up boxes (perhaps countably many) to see the real numbers contained within.  Then each mathematician must guess the real number that is contained in a particular unopened box of his choosing.

32,When does a sequence of rotated-and-circumscribed rectangles converge to a square?,When does a sequence of rotated-and-circumscribed rectangles converge to a square?,,"Recently I came up with an algebra problem with a nice geometric representation. Basically, I would like to know what happens if we repeatedly circumscribe a rectangle by another rectangle which is rotated by $\alpha \in \left( 0, \frac {\pi} {4}\right)$ radians. Use this picture as reference: In particular, do the resulting rectangles converge to a square? It is rather easy to show that the rectangles do converge to a square if $\alpha$ is constant throughout the process. However, if we make it more general by defineing a sequence $\left(\alpha_n\right)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ of angles and use $\alpha_i$ in the $i$'th operation, then the answer seems to depend on the chosen sequence. So, for which sequences $\left(\alpha_n\right)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ do the rectangles converge to a square? Algebraically this problem can be defined like this: Define two real sequences by $A_0=a, B_0=b, a \neq b, a,b \in R_{\gt0}$ and $A_{n+1}=B_n\sin\alpha_n + A_n\cos\alpha_n, B_{n+1}=A_n\sin\alpha_n + B_n\cos\alpha_n \forall n \in N_{\gt 0}$, where $\alpha_i \in \left( 0, \frac {\pi} {4}\right) \forall i \in N_{\ge 0}$. Is it true that $\lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{A_n}{B_n}=1$? I tried out a few sequences in C++ to notice some patterns. Interestingly, rectangles seem to converge to a square if and only if $\lim_{n \to \infty} \left( \sum_{i=0}^n \alpha_i \right) = \infty$. In particular, for $\alpha_n = \frac{1}{n}$ the convergence is really slow, however, it still seems to be converging. Also, I believe that showing $\lim_{n \to \infty}\left(A_n-B_n\right)=1$ would be an even stronger result for this problem. Does such a replacement have any influence on the result? For the record, I am still a high school student, so I have no idea how hard this problem might actually be. Any help would be highly appreciated. P.S. This is my first question on the site, so please don't judge my wording and style too much. Feel free to ask questions if anything is unclear.","Recently I came up with an algebra problem with a nice geometric representation.

I started to explore sequences that avoid both arithmetic and geometric progressions, i.e., avoid $x, x+c, x+2c$ and avoid $y, c y, c^2 y$ anywhere in the sequence (not necessarily consecutively). Starting with $(1,2)$ , one cannot extend with $3$ because $(1,2,3)$ forms an arithemtical progression, and one cannot extend with $4$ because $(1,2,4)$ is a geometric progression. But $(1,2,5)$ is fine.

As $|\cos n|$ oscillates throughout the interval $[0,1]$, it seems plausible that every real number ought to be a limit point of this sequence. But to show the limit doesn't exist, it's enough to show the sequence is less than $2$ infinitely often, and this can be done with continued fractions: we can find arbitrarily large $p$ and $q$ with $q$ odd such that $$ \left| \frac{\pi}{2} - \frac{p}{q} \right| < \frac{1}{q^2} $$ which implies $$ \left| \frac{q-1}{2} \pi + \frac{\pi}{2} - p \right| < \frac{1}{q} $$ making $p$ a good approximation of $\pi/2$ modulo $\pi$, and thus $$ \left| p \cos p \right| < \frac{p}{q} < 2 $$ This method fails if we consider instead the sequence $n^{1+\epsilon} \cos n$, since the final inequality is an increasing function of $n$. In fact, a heuristic statistical argument suggests that $$ \lim_{n \to +\infty} |n^{1 + \epsilon} \cos n| = +\infty $$ really does hold: imagine the $n$'s are actually uniformly randomly selected from $[0, \pi]$, there is a roughly $2p/\pi$ chance that $|\cos n| < p$.

Question : can we construct a nice, explicit function $f\neq 0$ fulfilling $(1)$ for every $n\in\mathbb{N}$ ? We may consider functions of the form $$ f(x) = \sum_{n\geq 0} c_n P_n(2x-1) $$ with $P_n(2x-1)$ being the $n$ -th shifted Legendre polynomial.

The minimal (with respect to the $\ell^2$ norm) solution of this infinite system with $c_2=1$ (or $c_4=1$ ) should give a sequence $\{c_n\}_{n\geq 0}$ ensuring the continuity of $f(x)$ , but this is non-trivial and I would appreciate a more explicit construction / example of such $f$ . Addendum : another possible construction is to apply the Gram-Schmidt process to $\{1,x,x^4,x^9,\ldots\}$ in order to get a sequence of polynomials $\{p_n(x)\}_{n\geq 0}$ such that $p_n(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{n} c_k x^{k^2}$ $n\neq m \Longrightarrow \langle p_n(x),p_m(x)\rangle = 0$ $\max_{x\in [0,1]} |p_n(x)| = 1$ or $\langle p_n(x),p_n(x)\rangle = 1$ then take $f(x)$ as the pointwise limit of a convergent subsequence of $\{p_n(x)\}_{n\geq 0}$ .

Let the numerator and the denominator be $A$ and $B$ respectively. Letting $a_k=\sqrt{10+\sqrt{50+\sqrt k}}, b_k=\sqrt{10-\sqrt{50+\sqrt k}}$, we can represent $A, B$ as $A=\sum a_k, B=\sum b_k.$ Letting $p_k=\sqrt{50+\sqrt k}$ and $q_k=\sqrt{50-\sqrt k}$, since ${p_k}^2+{q_k}^2=10^2$ and $p_k\gt0, q_k\gt0$, there exists a real number $0\lt x_k\lt \frac{\pi}{2}$ such that $p_k=10\cos x_k, q_k=10\sin x_k$. Then, we get $$a_k=\sqrt{10+10\cos x_k}=\sqrt{10+10\left(2{\cos^2{\frac{x_k}{2}}}-1\right)}=\sqrt{20}\cos \frac{x_k}{2},$$$$b_k=\sqrt{10-10\cos x_k}=\sqrt{10-10\left(1-2{\sin^2{\frac{x_k}{2}}}\right)}=\sqrt{20}\sin \frac{x_k}{2}.$$ Then, since $\sum a_k=\sum a_{2500-k}$, let's consider $a_{2500-k}$.$$a_{2500-k}=\sqrt{10+\sqrt{50+\sqrt{(50+\sqrt k)(50-\sqrt k)}}}=\sqrt{10+\sqrt{50+{p_kq_k}}}=\sqrt{10+\sqrt{50+100\cos {x_k}\sin {x_k}}}=\sqrt{10+\sqrt{50(\cos {x_k}+\sin {x_k})^2}}=\sqrt{10+\sqrt{50}\cdot\sqrt2\sin \left(x_k+\frac{\pi}{4}\right)}=\sqrt{10+10\cdot2\cos \left(\frac{x_k}{2}+\frac{\pi}{8}\right)\sin \left(\frac{x_k}{2}+\frac{\pi}{8}\right)}=\sqrt{10\left(\cos \left(\frac{x_k}{2}+\frac{\pi}{8}\right)+\sin \left(\frac{x_k}{2}+\frac{\pi}{8}\right)\right)^2}=\sqrt {10}\left(\cos \left(\frac{x_k}{2}+\frac{\pi}{8}\right)+\sin \left(\frac{x_k}{2}+\frac{\pi}{8}\right)\right)=\frac{\left(\cos \left(\frac{\pi}{8}\right)+\sin \left(\frac{\pi}{8}\right)\right)a_k+\left(\cos \left(\frac{\pi}{8}\right)-\sin \left(\frac{\pi}{8}\right)\right)b_k}{\sqrt2}=\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt2+1}{2\sqrt2}}a_k+\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt2-1}{2\sqrt2}}b_k.$$ Hence, $$A=\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt2+1}{2\sqrt2}}A+\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt2-1}{2\sqrt2}}B.$$ So, the proof is completed with $$\frac AB=1+\sqrt2+\sqrt{4+2\sqrt2}. $$ After a while, I got the following theorem in the same way as above. Theorem : For any natural number $n$, $$\frac{\sum_{k=1}^{n^2+2n}\sqrt{\sqrt{2n+2}+{\sqrt{n+1+\sqrt k}}}}{\sum_{k=1}^{n^2+2n}\sqrt{\sqrt{2n+2}-{\sqrt{n+1+\sqrt k}}}}=1+\sqrt2+\sqrt{4+2\sqrt2}=\cot {\frac{\pi}{16}}.$$ Note that the case $n=49$ in this theorem is the question at the top. I was surprised to get this theorem. Here is my question. Question : Why is the function $f(n)$ constant for any natural number $n$? How can we explain this theorem in a geometrical aspect? Is there any geometrical background ? My question is about the background of this equation, and about the reason, not about the proof of it. This theorem has been already proved. Though I've already proved it, I wonder why it is constant. Any help would be appriciated.","Why is the following function $f(n)$ constant for any natural number $n$?  $$f(n)=\frac{\sum_{k=1}^{n^2+2n}\sqrt{\sqrt{2n+2}+{\sqrt{n+1+\sqrt k}}}}{\sum_{k=1}^{n^2+2n}\sqrt{\sqrt{2n+2}-{\sqrt{n+1+\sqrt k}}}}=1+\sqrt2+\sqrt{4+2\sqrt2}=\cot {\frac{\pi}{16}}.$$ I've been asking the following question at MSE: Simplify $$\frac{\sum_{k=1}^{2499}\sqrt{10+{\sqrt{50+\sqrt{k}}}}}{\sum_{k=1}^{2499}\sqrt{10-{\sqrt{50+\sqrt{k}}}}}.$$ Simplify $\left({\sum_{k=1}^{2499}\sqrt{10+{\sqrt{50+\sqrt{k}}}}}\right)\left({\sum_{k=1}^{2499}\sqrt{10-{\sqrt{50+\sqrt{k}}}}}\right)^{-1}$ I've just got the following result:$$\frac{\sum_{k=1}^{2499}\sqrt{10+{\sqrt{50+\sqrt k}}}}{\sum_{k=1}^{2499}\sqrt{10-{\sqrt{50+\sqrt k}}}}=1+\sqrt2+\sqrt{4+2\sqrt2}.$$ Proof : Suppose that $\sum$ represents $\sum_{k=1}^{2499}$. Let the numerator and the denominator be $A$ and $B$ respectively. Letting $a_k=\sqrt{10+\sqrt{50+\sqrt k}}, b_k=\sqrt{10-\sqrt{50+\sqrt k}}$, we can represent $A, B$ as $A=\sum a_k, B=\sum b_k.$ Letting $p_k=\sqrt{50+\sqrt k}$ and $q_k=\sqrt{50-\sqrt k}$, since ${p_k}^2+{q_k}^2=10^2$ and $p_k\gt0, q_k\gt0$, there exists a real number $0\lt x_k\lt \frac{\pi}{2}$ such that $p_k=10\cos x_k, q_k=10\sin x_k$. Then, we get $$a_k=\sqrt{10+10\cos x_k}=\sqrt{10+10\left(2{\cos^2{\frac{x_k}{2}}}-1\right)}=\sqrt{20}\cos \frac{x_k}{2},$$$$b_k=\sqrt{10-10\cos x_k}=\sqrt{10-10\left(1-2{\sin^2{\frac{x_k}{2}}}\right)}=\sqrt{20}\sin \frac{x_k}{2}.$$ Then, since $\sum a_k=\sum a_{2500-k}$, let's consider $a_{2500-k}$.$$a_{2500-k}=\sqrt{10+\sqrt{50+\sqrt{(50+\sqrt k)(50-\sqrt k)}}}=\sqrt{10+\sqrt{50+{p_kq_k}}}=\sqrt{10+\sqrt{50+100\cos {x_k}\sin {x_k}}}=\sqrt{10+\sqrt{50(\cos {x_k}+\sin {x_k})^2}}=\sqrt{10+\sqrt{50}\cdot\sqrt2\sin \left(x_k+\frac{\pi}{4}\right)}=\sqrt{10+10\cdot2\cos \left(\frac{x_k}{2}+\frac{\pi}{8}\right)\sin \left(\frac{x_k}{2}+\frac{\pi}{8}\right)}=\sqrt{10\left(\cos \left(\frac{x_k}{2}+\frac{\pi}{8}\right)+\sin \left(\frac{x_k}{2}+\frac{\pi}{8}\right)\right)^2}=\sqrt {10}\left(\cos \left(\frac{x_k}{2}+\frac{\pi}{8}\right)+\sin \left(\frac{x_k}{2}+\frac{\pi}{8}\right)\right)=\frac{\left(\cos \left(\frac{\pi}{8}\right)+\sin \left(\frac{\pi}{8}\right)\right)a_k+\left(\cos \left(\frac{\pi}{8}\right)-\sin \left(\frac{\pi}{8}\right)\right)b_k}{\sqrt2}=\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt2+1}{2\sqrt2}}a_k+\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt2-1}{2\sqrt2}}b_k.$$ Hence, $$A=\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt2+1}{2\sqrt2}}A+\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt2-1}{2\sqrt2}}B.$$ So, the proof is completed with $$\frac AB=1+\sqrt2+\sqrt{4+2\sqrt2}. $$ After a while, I got the following theorem in the same way as above. Theorem : For any natural number $n$, $$\frac{\sum_{k=1}^{n^2+2n}\sqrt{\sqrt{2n+2}+{\sqrt{n+1+\sqrt k}}}}{\sum_{k=1}^{n^2+2n}\sqrt{\sqrt{2n+2}-{\sqrt{n+1+\sqrt k}}}}=1+\sqrt2+\sqrt{4+2\sqrt2}=\cot {\frac{\pi}{16}}.$$ Note that the case $n=49$ in this theorem is the question at the top.

99,A strange occurrence in the decimal digits of $\pi$?,A strange occurrence in the decimal digits of ?,\pi,"I was messing around with various ways to calculate $\pi$ with my computer, and I noticed something a bit strange. I was using $\frac{1}{1}-\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{5}-\frac{1}{7}+... = \frac{\pi}{4}$ , and computing this sum to varying degrees of accuracy. Using pi = 4*sum([((-1)**i)/(2*i+1) for i in range(n)]) , I got the following results for different values of n (I have highlighted in bold the digits which are incorrect): n result 1,000 3.14 0 592653 839794 10,000 3.141 4 926535 90034 25,000 3.1415 5 2653589 80 3 80,000 3.1415 801 5358974 96 100,000 3.1415 8 26535897 198 125,000 3.1415 84 6535897 28 160,000 3.1415 8640 358973 74 200,000 3.1415 87 6535897 618 250,000 3.1415 88 6535897 81 300,000 3.1415 89320256464 500,000 3.14159 0 653589 6 9 2 600,000 3.14159 09869230147 1,000,000 3.14159 1 6535897 743 It seems that when n has $2$ and $5$ as its only prime factors, there is a strange collection of correct digits after the first incorrect digit. Furthermore, it seems that the number of incorrect digits in the first string of incorrect digits increases in some way with the difference between the power of $2$ and the power of $5$ . (I haven't tested enough values of n to deduce much more about this though) I can't tell if this an artefact of the way the decimal computation is done by the computer, or if it the result of some theorem about the convergence of this series. Does anyone have any insights as to why this might be happening?","I was messing around with various ways to calculate with my computer, and I noticed something a bit strange.
