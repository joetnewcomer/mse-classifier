In the latter case, work with the sets $X'=(X\cup\{a\}) \smallsetminus \{b\}  $ and $X''=(X\cup \{c\})\smallsetminus\{b\}$ . I have no idea where $X'$ and $X''$ are from, e.g. are they assumptions or did I need to derive them? So I don't really know what kind of inference am I allowed to work on them. Even if I take them as assumptions, with the handful few things I have no idea what can I do with them. Frankly, the whole partial solution (apart from the givens and goal explanation) did more to confuse me than to help me. If I apply $b\notin X$ to $X'$ , I would even (seemingly mistakenly) get $b\in \{a\}$ , which must mean $b=a$ , which has gotta be wrong.

I give an alternative proof which may be flawed. If so, I want to understand why it's flawed. The context is the following discussion made by Halmos in Section 12 (The Peano Axioms). Induction is often used not only to prove things but also to define things. Suppose, to be specific, that $f$ is a function from a set $X$ into the same set $X$, and suppose that $a$ is an element of $X$. It seems natural to try to define an infinite sequence $\{u(n)\}$ of elements of $X$ (that is, a function $u$ from $\omega$ to $X$) in some such way as this: write $u(0) = a,\ u(1) = f(u(0)),\ u(2) = f(u(1))$, and so on. If the would-be definer were pressed to explain the ""and so on,"" he might lean on induction. What it all means, he might say, is that we define $u(0) = a$, and then, inductively, we define $u(n^+)$ as $f(u(n))$ for every $n$. This may sound plausible, but as justification for an existential assertion, it is insufficient. The principle of mathematical induction does indeed prove, easily, that there can be at most one function satisfying all the stated conditions, but it does not establish the existence of such a function. OK, fair enough. This argument is circular in that it uses the function $u$ in order to define $u$. Halmos then proves a theorem which does establish the existence of such a function: Recursion theorem. If $a$ is an element of a set $X$, and if $f$ is a function from $X$ into $X$, then there exists a function $u$ from $\omega$ into $X$ such that $u(0) = a$ and such that $u(n^+) = f(u(n))$ for all $a \in \omega$. He proves this by considering the class $\mathcal{C}$ of all subsets $A$ of $\omega \times X$ such that $(0,a) \in A$ and for which $(n^+, f(x)) \in A$ whenever $(n,x) \in A$. He notes that the class is not vacuous, because $\omega \times X$ itself satisfies the conditions. He then forms the intersection of all elements of $\mathcal{C}$ and proves that it is a function with the desired properties. I have no problem understanding the proof, but I am trying to understand why it's necessary to do it the way he did. He uses what one might call a ""top-down"" approach, starting with all of $\omega \times X$, and reducing it to a subset which is the desired function. Would not the following ""bottom-up"" approach work? To me it just seems like a more pedantic version of the flawed induction argument, so I'm guessing that this is also wrong. But I don't see what the problem is. Possibly flawed proof: For each $n \in \omega$, define $U_n = \{(n, f^n(a))\} \in \omega \times X$, where $f^n$ denotes the $n$-fold composition of $f$. My convention (and that of Halmos) is that $0 \in \omega$, and by $f^0(a)$ I mean simply $a$. Define $U = \bigcup_{n=0}^{\infty}U_n$. Clearly $U \subseteq \omega \times X$. To prove that $U$ is a function from $\omega$ to $X$, we need to verify that for each $n \in \omega$, there is exactly one element of $U$ with $n$ in the first slot. But this is immediately clear from the construction of $U$. It remains to verify that $U$ satisfies the indicated recursion. Since $U_0 = \{(0, a)\} \subseteq U$, we have $U(0) = a$. Moreover, given any $n \in \omega$, we have $U_n = \{(n, f^n(a)\} \subseteq U$, so $U(n) = f^n(a)$, and $U_{n^+} = U_{n+1} = \{(n+1, f^{n+1}(a)\} \subseteq U$, so $U(n+1) = f^{n+1}(a)$.

Lemma: Let A and B be sets such that there is no bijection from A onto B. Let $f:A\to B$ and $g:B\to A$ be injections. Then there is at least one element $x\in A$ such that $f(x)\not= g^{-1}(x)$. Proof: By contradiction. Assume that $f(a)=g^{-1}(a)$ for every $a\in A$ where $g^{-1}(a)$ is defined. Either $A=g[B]$ or $g[B]\subset A$ (strictly contained). If $g[B] = A$, then $f=g^{-1}$ and $f$ is a bijection, which is a contradiction. So $g[B]\subset A$. But since $g^{-1}$ is a surjection, every element of $B$ is mapped to an element of $A$, so for any $x\in A-g[B]$, $f(x)=f(y)$ for some $y\in g[B]$ and $f$ is not injective, which is a contradiction. proof of theorem: By contradiction. Assume there is no bijection from $A$ onto $B$. By the lemma, since f and g are injections, there must be a $a\in A$ such that $f(a)\not=g^{-1}(a)$. Similarly, there must be a $b\in B$ such that $g(b)\not=f^{-1}(b)$.   Let $A'$ and $B'$ be the subsets of A and B where $a\in A',b\in B'$ iff $f(a)\not=g^{-1}(a), g(b)\not= f^{-1}(b)$ Define $h:A\to B$ where    $$h(x)=f(x)$$ whenever $f(x)=g^{-1}(x)$    and $$h(a)=b $$where $a$ is some element of $ A'$ and $b$ is some element of $ B'$. Clearly, $h:A-A'\to B-B'$ is a bijection, since $f=g^{-1}$ is a bijection.

Please don't give me the answer but please verify if this proof works or, if not, if it is the start of a proof that needs to be filled in, or if you think I should abandon this line of thought. If it doesn't work, please explain why. This is kind of a sketch of a proof, really, and (I think) it uses the axiom of choice which I don't like, but it's a start. (I'm not sure if it actually uses the AoC. Does it?) Theorem: Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. Let $f:A\to B$ and $g:B\to A$ be injections. Then there is a bijection from $A$ onto $B$. Lemma: Let A and B be sets such that there is no bijection from A onto B. Let $f:A\to B$ and $g:B\to A$ be injections. Then there is at least one element $x\in A$ such that $f(x)\not= g^{-1}(x)$. Proof: By contradiction. Assume that $f(a)=g^{-1}(a)$ for every $a\in A$ where $g^{-1}(a)$ is defined. Either $A=g[B]$ or $g[B]\subset A$ (strictly contained). If $g[B] = A$, then $f=g^{-1}$ and $f$ is a bijection, which is a contradiction. So $g[B]\subset A$. But since $g^{-1}$ is a surjection, every element of $B$ is mapped to an element of $A$, so for any $x\in A-g[B]$, $f(x)=f(y)$ for some $y\in g[B]$ and $f$ is not injective, which is a contradiction. proof of theorem: By contradiction. Assume there is no bijection from $A$ onto $B$. By the lemma, since f and g are injections, there must be a $a\in A$ such that $f(a)\not=g^{-1}(a)$. Similarly, there must be a $b\in B$ such that $g(b)\not=f^{-1}(b)$.   Let $A'$ and $B'$ be the subsets of A and B where $a\in A',b\in B'$ iff $f(a)\not=g^{-1}(a), g(b)\not= f^{-1}(b)$ Define $h:A\to B$ where    $$h(x)=f(x)$$ whenever $f(x)=g^{-1}(x)$    and $$h(a)=b $$where $a$ is some element of $ A'$ and $b$ is some element of $ B'$. Clearly, $h:A-A'\to B-B'$ is a bijection, since $f=g^{-1}$ is a bijection. Also, $h:A'\to B'$ is a bijection because And then something about how there is always a $d\in B'$ for any $c\in A'$, meaning they come in pairs, but then we can define $h(c)=d$ and get our bijection again.

I don't understand it. Also I think that $x,y\in P$ should be $x,y\in X$. Could someone give an insight of the exercise and also some hint of how to solve the third part, please? Thanks Let $X$ be a set and let $P$ be the set of all the partial ordering of $X$. We say that one partial ordering $\le \in P$ is a coarser than another partial ordering $\le' \in P$ if for any $x,y\in P$ we have the implication $x\le y \Rightarrow x\le' y$. Let us write $\le \preceq\le' $ if $\le$ is a coarser than $\le ' $. (1) Show that $\preceq$ turns $P$ into a partially ordered set. We will show that is partial ordered relation. Clearly if $x\le y \rightarrow x\le y$, i.e., $\le \preceq \le$ which shows that is a reflexive relation. For anti-symmetric relation, suppose that   $x\le y \rightarrow x\le' y$ and $x\le' y \rightarrow x\le y$, then we have $x\le y  \leftrightarrow x\le' y$ for all $x,y$. Thus $\le = \le'$ since otherwise the logical equivalence doesn't hold. To conclude we have to show that $\preceq$ is a transitive relation. Suppose that  $x\le y \rightarrow x\le' y$ and $x\le' y \rightarrow x\le'' y$, thus $x\le y\rightarrow  x\le'' y $ which means that  if $\le \preceq \le'$ and $\le' \preceq \le''$, so $\le \preceq \le''$, since $x,y$ are given. (2) There is exactly one minimal element of $P$, what is it? But I'm not sure of what the minimal element should be I thought it would be the empty relation but since $X$ is not assume to be empty, then the empty relation cannot be reflexive and in particular is not a partial ordering on $X$, i.e., $\le_\varnothing \notin P$ (3) Show that the maximal ordering of $P$ are precisely the total ordering. Using Zorn's lemma show that given any partial ordering $\le$ of $X$ there exists a total ordering $\le'$ such that $\le$ is coarser than $\le'$ We have to show that the set $P$ is non-empty. If $X= \varnothing$ then $\le_\varnothing \in P$ where $\le_\varnothing $ denote the empty relation. In case that $X\not= \varnothing$, then it contains some $x\in X$ and so we can define that $\forall y,z\in X$ we have $y\le_X z \iff (y\not= x \text{ and } y =z) \text{ or } z = x$. The relation defined above is a partial ordering of $X$. Since is reflexive $y\le_X y$. If $y\le_X z$ and $z\le_X y$ then we have either $z=x$ or $y\not= x$ and $y=z$, If $z=x$, then $z\le_X y$ implies that $y=x$ and so $y=x=z$, in the case that $y\not=x$ and $y=z$ we're done. Now if $y\le_X z$ and $z\le_X w$, we have if $z=x$ so $w=z=x$ and clearly $z\le_X w$, otherwise $y\not= x$ and $y=z$, so $z\not= x$ and $z=w$, i.e., $x\le_X w$. Hence $\le_X \in P$ In either case $P\not= \varnothing$. Now let $\mathcal{C}$ be a totally ordered subset of $P$ we have to show that there is an upper bound. Let $\le_\mathcal{C}$ be defined as follows, we say that for $x,y\in X, \;x\le_\mathcal{C} y \iff  \exists \le'\in \mathcal{C}$ such that $x\le' y $. We have to show $\le_\mathcal{C} $ is well-defined. Suppose $\le, \le' \in \mathcal{C}$ and there exists $x,y \in X$ such that $x\le y$ and $y\le' x$ but $y\not= x$. Since both are in $\mathcal{C}$ either $\le \preceq \le'$ or $\le' \preceq \le$. Without loss of generality suppose that $\le \preceq \le'$, then $x\le y$ implies $x\le' y$ and since $x\not= y$ so $x<' y$ which contradicts our assumption that $y<' x$. Hence $\le_\mathcal{C} $  is well-defined. Also is not difficult to show that is a partial ordering of $X$. Clearly $\le_\mathcal{C}$ is an upper bound for $\mathcal{C}$ because whenever $x\le' y$ for $\le' \in \mathcal{C}$ would imply $x\le_\mathcal{C} y$, which means $\le' \preceq \le_\mathcal{C}$. Thus by Zorn's lemma  $X$ contains at least one maximal element which we call $\le_P$. We claim that $\le_P$ is a total ordering of $X$. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that  $\le_P$ is not a total ordering of $X$. Thus there must be a pair $x,y\in X$ for which neither $x\not\le_p y$ nor $y\not\le_p x$. Thus we can define $\le = \le_p$ for all $X\backslash \{x,y\}$ and we set $x\le y$. Thus is a partial ordering of  $X$, i.e., $\le \in P$ and also $\le_p \preceq \le$, note that the implication $x\le_p y \rightarrow x\le y$ is vacuously true, which is a contradiction. Hence $\le_p$ is a total ordering of $X$. Am I right? Other question: What would be the minimum element of $P$?","I have trouble with the following exercise. I don't understand it.

Hence $\le_X \in P$ In either case $P\not= \varnothing$. Now let $\mathcal{C}$ be a totally ordered subset of $P$ we have to show that there is an upper bound.

I'm thinking along the lines that for every x in U, x can be (not in A but in B), or (not in A but in C), but that does not imply that x is always in B or always in C (it can be in either) and so A does not have to be a subset of B or C.","A \subseteq B \cup C \to A \subseteq B \lor A \subseteq C A \subseteq B \cup C \to \forall x \in U, x \in A \to x \in B \cup C A \subseteq B \cup C \to \forall x \in U, x \in A \to x \in A \to (x \in B \lor x \in C) A \subseteq B \cup C \to \forall x \in U, x \in A \to \sim(x \in A) \lor (x \in B \lor x \in C) A \subseteq B \cup C \to \forall x \in U, x \in A \to \sim(x \in A) \lor \sim(x \in A) \lor (x \in B \lor x \in C) A \subseteq B \cup C \to \forall x \in U, x \in A \to (\sim(x \in A) \lor x \in B) \lor (\sim(x \in A) \lor x \in C) A \subseteq B \cup C \to \forall x \in U, (x \in A \to x \in B) \lor (x \in A \to x \in C) \therefore A \subseteq B \cup C \to A \subseteq B \lor A \subseteq C","['elementary-set-theory', 'logic']"

Choose a $f_0\in \mathscr{R}$ and consider $\phi: \mathscr{B}\to \mathscr{R}; g\mapsto g\circ f_0$. Is this function well defined? I claim that $g\circ f_0$ is repetitive. Let $(a_1, \ldots, a_n)$ be a sequence of natural numbers, then consider the sequence $(g^{-1}(a_1), g^{-1}(a_2), \ldots, g^{-1}(a_n))$. Since $f_0$ is repetitive we find a $k\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $f_0(k) = g^{-1}(a_1), \ldots, f_0(k+n-1) = g^{-1}(a_n)$. But then $g\circ f_0(k) = a_1, \ldots, g\circ f_0(k+n-1) = a_n$. Okay, $g\circ f_0$ is repetitive. Is $\phi$ injective? Let $g\circ f_0 = h\circ f_0$. Notice how $f_0$ must be surjective, since it is a repetitive function. (Just consider the finite sequence $(a_0)$ for any $a_0\in \mathbb{N}$). Now choose an $n\in \mathbb{N}$, then there is a $k\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $f_0(k) = n$. Now consider $g(n) = g(f_0(k)) = g\circ f_0(k) = h\circ f_0(k) = h(n)$. Which implies $g=h$.

( Hint : it may help to use the previous exercise, i.e. 'Prove that the set of bijections $\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{N}$ is uncountable' ) There also was a subquestion where I had to prove that if $f$ is repetitive then for any $(a_1, \ldots, a_n)$ there are infinitely manu $k$'s with the property. I don't see how to prove the uncountability. My first idea was to assume countability and then through a diagonalization argument end up with a contradition. But constructing a function which has the repetitive property seems hard... Perhaps the hint wants to point at something like an injection from the set of bijections to the set of repetitive numbers.
