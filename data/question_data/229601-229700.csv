Proof: Write $X=\bigcup_{i\in\mathbb{N}} A_i$ where $|A_i|\leq|\mathbb{N}|$ and, without loss of generality, $A_i\bigcap A_j=\varnothing$ for all $i\neq j$. Let $Q_n=\{q\in\mathbb{Q}:\;n-1< q\leq n\}$ for $n\geq 1$. Since $|Q_n|=|\mathbb{N}|$ we can consider an injection $\phi:\;A_i\to Q_i$ for each $i$. Then $\phi: X\to \bigcup_{i\in\mathbb{N}} Q_i=\mathbb{Q}^+$ and hence $|X|\leq |\mathbb{Q}^+|=|\mathbb{N}|\Rightarrow X$ is countable. This is fairly new to me, so I'd like to check that what I'm doing is acceptable: have I used the axiom of choice? is it alright to claim the existence of a $\phi$, as I have? is it acceptable to use $|\mathbb{Q}|=|\mathbb{N}|$ here, or is this a bit circular?

For example, the cardinality of the reals is literally bigger than the cardinality of the rationals. One cannot match them one-to-one. Georg Cantor proved this several times. But if I look at the infinities and the items they contain, I noticed a pattern. Aleph-0 is the infinity of the rational numbers. Any rational number is either terminating or repeating. To store any given rational finite number, one would need a finite amount of information. No matter how precise, the precision would be finite, and thus could be representable in a finite amount of information (bits, digits, etc). But then if I look at the power set of Aleph-0 which is has the cardinality of the reals, to specify any given element from any other requires infinite information. An infinite number of bits is required to name any given irrational number. However, the amount of information needed to name any one element of an uncountable set is infinite, but countable . Each digit of pi corresponds to a natural number. So if I extend this, to, say, the power set of the set of the real numbers, would that mean, to specify any given element, I would need an uncountable amount of information? There would be no digits in order that could possibly name any given element in the set, even given an infinite number of them? In summary, is my assumption correct that for any one of the infinity infinite sets of differing sizes, to single out any one element, would require an amount of information equal to the previous smaller infinity?","I was thinking about the fact that some infinities are 'bigger' than others.

Is the set  uncountably infinite?,A B B^A,"Let $A$ be a finite set. Suppose $B$ is countably infinite. Is the set $B^A$ uncountably infinite? I am new to infinite cardinality arguments, but my initial thinking is yes . However, I am uncertain if the claim requires the Axiom of Choice ... I am concerned that I am using the Axiom of Choice without realizing it, and I would like to not invoke the axiom if possible. The following is my pseudo-informal argument. Because $B$ is countably infinite, there exists an injection (possibly bijection) from $B$ to $\mathbb N$ . (i.e. $B \preceq \mathbb N)$ . Let $F$ be one such function so that $F:B \xrightarrow{1-1} \mathbb N$ . Knowing that $\mathbb N$ is well-ordered, I can conclude that all subsets of $\mathbb N$ are well-ordered. Thus every member of $\mathcal P(\mathbb N) \setminus \{\emptyset\}$ has a minimal element. Further, by Cantor's Diagonal argument $\mathcal P (\mathbb N)$ is uncountably infinite, which implies that $\mathcal P(\mathbb N) \setminus \{\emptyset\}$ is uncountably infinite as well. I believe a similar argument can be made for $\mathcal P(B)$ . Let $p_{_B}$ be an arbitrary element of $\mathcal P( B) \setminus \{\emptyset\}$ . I know that restricting $F$ 's domain to $p_{_B}$ will produce a subset in $\mathbb N$ . Call this subset $\mathbb N_{p_B}$ . (i.e. $F[p_{_B}]=\mathbb N_{p_B}$ ) Let $n_{0}$ be the minimal element of $\mathbb N_{p_B}$ . Let $b \in p_{_B}$ be the element that is mapped to through $F^{-1}$ ...i.e. $F^{-1}(n_0)=b$ . Because $F$ is injective, this is unambiguous. Now, consider the construction of a function $g_{p_B}$ . Let $g_{p_B}$ be the function that takes all elements of $A$ and maps them to the $b \in p_{_B}$ that corresponds to minimal element $n_0$ for a given $\mathbb N_{p_B}$ . ( This is where I am concerned ...I think I am using a valid invocation of the Axiom of Replacement, but perhaps it is actually the Axiom of Choice) Because there are an uncountably infinite number of $p_{_B}$ 's in $\mathcal P( B) \setminus \{\emptyset\}$ , there must necessarily be an uncountably infinite number of $g_{p_B}$ 's that satisfy the above definition. The collection of all such functions is a subset of $B^A$ . Therefore, if a subset of a given set is uncountably infinite, the set itself must be uncountably infinite. Edit Just to highlight an issue in my reasoning, here is one of my afterthoughts (confirmed by Arturo Magidin): ""Now that you mention it, it does seem like there is necessarily a chance that many of the $g_{p_B}$ 's are redundant...i.e. there may be a $p_{_B}\neq p'_{_B}$ that can be represented by the same $g$ function.

Axiom of Dependent Choice Let $T \neq\varnothing$ and $\mathcal{R} \subseteq T^2$ such that $\forall a \in T, \exists b \in T: a\mathcal{R}b$. Then there exists $(x_n \mid n \in \mathbb N)$ such that $x_n \mathcal{R} x_{n+1}$. Axiom of Countable Choice Let $(A_n \mid n \in \mathbb N)$ be a sequence of non-empty sets and $X=\bigcup_{n \in \mathbb N} A_n$. Then there exists a mapping $f: \mathbb N \to X$ such that $f(n) \in A_n$. My proof that Axiom of Dependent Choice implies Axiom of Countable Choice: Let $T=\{s: n \to X \mid n \in \mathbb N \text{ and } \forall k < n:s(k) \in A(k)\}$ and $\mathcal{R}=\{(u,v) \in T^2 \mid u \subsetneq v\}$. Assume $s: n\to X$ such that $s\in T$. Let $s': n+1\to X$ such that $s'(x)=s(x)$ for all $x<n$ and $s'(n)\in A(n)$. Then $s'\in T$ and $s\subsetneq s'$. That is for all $s \in T$, there exists $s' \in T$ such that $s \mathcal{R} s'$. As a result, $\mathcal{R}$  satisfies the requirement of DC. Hence there is a sequence $(s_n \mid n \in \mathbb N)$ through $T$ such that for all $m \le n \in \mathbb N \colon s_m \subseteq s_n$. Let $f=\bigcup_{n \in \mathbb N} s_n$. Now we prove $f$ is the desired function. 1. f is a function Let $(k,a),(k,b) \in f$. Then $\exists u, v \in (s_n \mid n \in \mathbb N)$ such that $ (k,a) \in u, (k,b) \in v$. Assume $u \subsetneq v$. This implies $(k,a) \in v$. $(k,a),(k,b) \in v \implies a=b$. Thus $f$ is a function. 2. $\mathrm{dom}(f)=\mathbb N$ $\forall s \in T: 0 \in \mathrm{dom}(s) \implies 0 \in \mathrm{dom}(f)$. Assume $n \in \mathrm{dom}(f)$. This implies $\exists s_{t} \in (s_n \mid n \in \mathbb N): n \in \mathrm{dom}(s_{t})$. On the other hand, $s_{t} \subsetneq s_{t+1} \implies n+1 \in \mathrm{dom}(s_{t+1}) \implies n+1 \in \mathrm{dom}(f)$. Thus $\mathrm{dom}(f)=\mathbb N$. 3. Condition $f(n) \in A_n$ Let $(n,f(n)) \in f$. Then $\exists s_{t} \in (s_n \mid n \in \mathbb N): (n,f(n)) \in s_{t}$. $s_{t}(n) \in A_n \implies f(n) \in A_n$.

I was solving a problem in Apostol's Calculus Volume 1. It is to show that $$B-\bigcup_{A\in F} A=\bigcap_{A\in F}(B-A)\qquad\text{ and }\qquad B-\bigcap_{A\in F} A=\bigcup_{A\in F}(B-A)$$ so I thought that rather than repeating the problem just with $\bigcup$ and $\bigcap$ switched, why not create the notation of a circle with one half filled in to be like $\pm$ for the big cup and cap? In other words, see the attached image. The motivation for using this particular symbol should be clear because the one with a the bottom half colored black leaves only a semicircle at the top which is kinda $\bigcap$, and similarly the one with the top half colored black leaves a semicircular segment at the bottom which looks like $\bigcup$. But of course I do not mean to say that the one with the top colored black should denote $\bigcup$, nor that the one with the bottom colored black should denote $\bigcap$; rather, I am just using the symbols in the same way as say $\pm$ and $\mp$ are used in $$\tan(a\pm b)=\frac{\tan a\pm \tan b}{1\mp \tan a\tan b},$$ to write two formulas in one.

Does it then make sense to argue that $g(x) = f_x(x)$ is not primitive recursive either, because if it were, then $d(x) = g(x)+1$ would be primitive recursive as well (since the set of primitive recursive functions is closed under the successor function)?","I'm trying to understand diagonalization as it applies to proving that not all total functions are primitive recursive functions. For example, say that we enumerate all primitive recursive functions as $f_0, f_1, f_2, \dots$. Then, suppose that we show that $d(x) = f_x(x) + 1$ is not in this list (by diagonalization), and so it is not primitive recursive.

But $(0,1)$ can be also put in bijection with, say, all the base-10 number representations. Wouldn't that render a power of $10^\mathbb{N_0}$ for $(0,1)$? Thank you in advance.
