10,Do the two limits coincide?,Do the two limits coincide?,,"Let $a$ be a non negative (positive almost everywhere) weight  in $L_{loc}^1(\Omega)$, $\Omega\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ is open. For $\varphi\in C_c^{\infty}(\Omega)$ define $$ \Vert\varphi\Vert_a^2=\int_{\Omega} a(x)|\nabla\varphi(x)|^2\,\mathrm{d}x. $$ Then $\Vert\cdot\Vert_a^2$ is a norm on $C_c^{\infty}(\Omega)$. Let $D_0^1(\Omega;a)$ denotes the closure of $C_c^{\infty}(\Omega)$ with respect to the $\Vert\cdot\Vert_a^2$-norm. Let $\{\varphi_n\}\in C_c^{\infty}(\Omega)$ and $\varphi_n\to \varphi$ in $D_0^1(\Omega;a)$  and also we have $\varphi_n\to \psi$ in some space $L^p(\Omega),\,1\leqslant p\leqslant\infty$. Can we say that $\varphi=\psi$? And why? A similar situation happens in the proof of Sobolev embedding theorem. Where we have a smooth sequence $\{\varphi_n\}$ tends to a $u\in W^{1,p}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and then we show $\varphi_n$ tends to some $v\in L^{p^*}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and then we say $u=v$ a.e. In this situation, my understanding is : since $\Vert\varphi_n-u\Vert_p\to 0$ and $\Vert\varphi_n-v\Vert_{p^*}\to 0$ there is a subsequence $\{\varphi_{n_{k_i}}\}$ converges almost everywhere to both $u$ and $v$, then $u=v$ a.e. But in the $D_0^1(\Omega;a)$ case, does there also a subsequence converges to $\varphi$ a.e.? Or some other approachs? Any advice will be appreciated! Edit Here is some of my thought: For $u_k\in L^p(\Omega), 1\leqslant p\leqslant\infty$, $u_k\to u$ in $L^p(\Omega)$, define  $$ \langle u,\varphi\rangle=\int_{\Omega}u\varphi $$  for all $\varphi\in C_c^{\infty}(\Omega)$. We see this integral makes sense since $\varphi$ has compact support and $u$ is locally integrable. And it is a continuous linear functional on $C_c^{\infty}(\Omega)$. Furthermore $$ |\langle u_k,\varphi\rangle-\langle u,\varphi\rangle|\leqslant \int_{\Omega}|u_k-u||\varphi|\to 0 $$ by Holder's inequality. Thus we have $u_k\to u$ in $\mathcal{D}'(\Omega)$. In Sobolev case we have $u_k$ tends to both $u$ and $v$ in $\mathcal{D}'(\Omega)$, so $u=v$ a.e. For $u_k\in D_0^1(\Omega;a)$, $u_k\to v$ in $D_0^1(\Omega;a)$, define  $$ \langle u,\varphi\rangle=\int_{\Omega}a^{1/2}(x)|\nabla u|\varphi. $$ for all $\varphi\in C_c^{\infty}(\Omega)$. Then the integral makes sense by applying Holder's inequality. And it is also a linear continuous functional on $\mathcal{D}'(\Omega)$. Furthermore $$ |\langle u_k,\varphi\rangle-\langle v,\varphi\rangle|\leqslant \int_{\Omega}a^{1/2}(x)|\nabla u_k-\nabla u||\varphi|\to 0 $$ by Holder's inequality. So we have $u_k \to v$ in $\mathcal{D}'(\Omega)$, which implies $u=v$ a.e. And this answers my question why $\psi=\varphi$ a.e. Is there something wrong in my ""proof""? Or some better approaches? Thanks! Edit $$ |\langle u_k,\varphi\rangle-\langle v,\varphi\rangle|\leqslant \int_{\Omega}a^{1/2}(x)|\nabla u_k-\nabla u||\varphi|\to 0 $$ seems only mean $a^{1/2}(x)|\nabla u|\to a^{1/2}(x)|\nabla v|$ in $\mathcal{D}'(\Omega)$, and this says nothing about my question I think! Could any one help me?","Let $a$ be a non negative (positive almost everywhere) weight  in $L_{loc}^1(\Omega)$, $\Omega\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ is open. For $\varphi\in C_c^{\infty}(\Omega)$ define $$ \Vert\varphi\Vert_a^2=\int_{\Omega} a(x)|\nabla\varphi(x)|^2\,\mathrm{d}x. $$ Then $\Vert\cdot\Vert_a^2$ is a norm on $C_c^{\infty}(\Omega)$. Let $D_0^1(\Omega;a)$ denotes the closure of $C_c^{\infty}(\Omega)$ with respect to the $\Vert\cdot\Vert_a^2$-norm. Let $\{\varphi_n\}\in C_c^{\infty}(\Omega)$ and $\varphi_n\to \varphi$ in $D_0^1(\Omega;a)$  and also we have $\varphi_n\to \psi$ in some space $L^p(\Omega),\,1\leqslant p\leqslant\infty$. Can we say that $\varphi=\psi$? And why? A similar situation happens in the proof of Sobolev embedding theorem. Where we have a smooth sequence $\{\varphi_n\}$ tends to a $u\in W^{1,p}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and then we show $\varphi_n$ tends to some $v\in L^{p^*}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and then we say $u=v$ a.e. In this situation, my understanding is : since $\Vert\varphi_n-u\Vert_p\to 0$ and $\Vert\varphi_n-v\Vert_{p^*}\to 0$ there is a subsequence $\{\varphi_{n_{k_i}}\}$ converges almost everywhere to both $u$ and $v$, then $u=v$ a.e. But in the $D_0^1(\Omega;a)$ case, does there also a subsequence converges to $\varphi$ a.e.? Or some other approachs? Any advice will be appreciated! Edit Here is some of my thought: For $u_k\in L^p(\Omega), 1\leqslant p\leqslant\infty$, $u_k\to u$ in $L^p(\Omega)$, define  $$ \langle u,\varphi\rangle=\int_{\Omega}u\varphi $$  for all $\varphi\in C_c^{\infty}(\Omega)$. We see this integral makes sense since $\varphi$ has compact support and $u$ is locally integrable. And it is a continuous linear functional on $C_c^{\infty}(\Omega)$. Furthermore $$ |\langle u_k,\varphi\rangle-\langle u,\varphi\rangle|\leqslant \int_{\Omega}|u_k-u||\varphi|\to 0 $$ by Holder's inequality. Thus we have $u_k\to u$ in $\mathcal{D}'(\Omega)$. In Sobolev case we have $u_k$ tends to both $u$ and $v$ in $\mathcal{D}'(\Omega)$, so $u=v$ a.e. For $u_k\in D_0^1(\Omega;a)$, $u_k\to v$ in $D_0^1(\Omega;a)$, define  $$ \langle u,\varphi\rangle=\int_{\Omega}a^{1/2}(x)|\nabla u|\varphi. $$ for all $\varphi\in C_c^{\infty}(\Omega)$. Then the integral makes sense by applying Holder's inequality. And it is also a linear continuous functional on $\mathcal{D}'(\Omega)$. Furthermore $$ |\langle u_k,\varphi\rangle-\langle v,\varphi\rangle|\leqslant \int_{\Omega}a^{1/2}(x)|\nabla u_k-\nabla u||\varphi|\to 0 $$ by Holder's inequality. So we have $u_k \to v$ in $\mathcal{D}'(\Omega)$, which implies $u=v$ a.e. And this answers my question why $\psi=\varphi$ a.e. Is there something wrong in my ""proof""? Or some better approaches? Thanks!

17,When is it possible to transform limits using substitution?,When is it possible to transform limits using substitution?,,"In calculus, if I have to calculate $\lim_{x \to x_0}f(x)$ , we can usually do substitutions of the from $x=\phi(y)$ and then our limit would be $\lim_{y \to \phi(x_0)}f(\phi(y))$ . However, we cannot just choose some arbitrary $\phi$ . As a counterexample, take $\lim_{x \to 2}x$ . You cannot take $x=\phi(y)=0$ , so my intuition says that $\phi$ needs to be bijective in a small enough neighbourhood of $x_0$ . Also, I would assume that $\phi$ needs to be continuous at $x_0$ . The substitution $\phi(x)=\text{floor}(x)$ would also fail, firstly because of non-injectivity, but also because of non-continuity. Do we need any more conditions on $\phi$ ? For context, the reason why I am asking this is because in my university coursed, our profesor said that if we want to calculate $\lim_{(x, y) \to (0, 0)}f(x, y)$ , we can just change to polar coordinates and calculate and it would be easier. I am currently studying engineering, so I would be looking for some theoretical, pure maths proof on the restrictions of the substitution $(x, y)=\phi(u, v)$ . To rephrase my question. Given two topological spaces $(T, \tau_T)$ , $(S, \tau_S)$ and $(U, \tau_U)$ , $D \subseteq T$ , a function $f\colon D \to S$ and $x_0$ an accumulation point of $D$ . Now let $V$ be a neighbourhood of $x_0$ and $\phi\colon U \to D \cap V$ . What would be the minimum conditions that $\phi$ needs to obey such that $\lim_{x \to x_0}f(x)=\lim_{y \to \phi(x_0)}f(\phi(y))$ ? Is the bijectivity and continuity of $\phi$ equivalent to the equality of limits in the general case?

18,Why inner regularity of measure is defined as to be approximable from within by compact sets and not by closed sets?,Why inner regularity of measure is defined as to be approximable from within by compact sets and not by closed sets?,,"This question has been asked here , but I don't believe that we have had a satisfactory answer, so I would like to reformulate that question. Please forgive me if this question turns out to be rather silly. Let $(X,\mathcal{T})$ be a topological space, $(X,\Sigma,\mu)$ be a measurable space such that $\Sigma$ contains the borel algebra. Usually, $\mu$ is called outer regular if $$ \mu(A)=\inf\{\mu(G):G\supset A,G\text{ open}\},\quad\forall A\text{ measurable}. $$ Personally, I would be very tempted to defind a measure to be inner regular if $$ \mu(A)=\sup\{\mu(F):F\subset A,F\text{ closed}\},\quad\forall A\text{ measurable}.\tag{1} $$ But it turns out that the definition in reality is $$ \mu(A)=\sup\{\mu(F):F\subset A,F\text{ compact}\},\quad\forall A\text{ measurable}.\tag{2} $$ And I'm wondering why. Since that a measure satisfying $(2)$ is called inner regular, let's call a measure satisfying $(1)$ one that is approximable by closed sets . The two notions can be very different. For a $KC$ space (where every compact set is closed), every inner regular measure is approximable by closed sets, but not vice versa: consider the lower limit topology and the Lebesgue measure $\mu$ over $\mathbb{R}$ . Since this topology contains more closed sets than the usual one, $\mu$ is clearly approximable by closed sets, but $\mu$ is not inner regular since every compact set in the lower limit topology is countable. If we remove the $KC$ assumption, then an inner regular measure is not necessarily approximable by closed sets: consider the trivial topology where every set is compact. If $\mu$ is approximable by closed sets, then every measurable proper subset of $X$ has measure $0$ , so either $\Sigma=\{\emptyset,X\}$ , either $\mu(X)=0$ . So I would like to ask: why do we choose to break the symmetry here in the definition of outer and inner regularity? In other words, why is using closed sets less desirable, while using open sets is acceptable? Or are we generally working in the setting where the two definitions become equivalent?","This question has been asked here , but I don't believe that we have had a satisfactory answer, so I would like to reformulate that question.

20,Prove / Disprove / Complete the proof That $f$ is Infinitely Differentiable,Prove / Disprove / Complete the proof That  is Infinitely Differentiable,f,"THE NEW (MUCH SHORTER) POST My original post perhaps was too long for most people, and understandably not a lot of people tried to go over it. In this new post my question is much shorter please prove or disprove that following function is infinitely differentiable on $\mathbb{R}$ , or alternatively answer my original post (it is below here), which basically means helping me completing my proposed proof. Even if you don't want to answer my original post because it 's too long, it might be worth at least looking at some of it, because it could be useful. Let $E$ be some closed set of real numbers. Then, we define $f$ by 3 cases: $\quad$ (I) If $x \in E$ , $f(x) = 0$ . $\quad$ (II) If $x \in (a,b)$ , where $a,b \in E$ and $(a,b) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus E$ , define $$F_{a,b}(x) = \frac{\pi}{b-a}\left(x + \frac{3b-5a}{2}\right),$$ $\quad$ and then $$f(x) = X_{a,b}\cos^{F_{a,b}(x)}\left(F_{a,b}(x)\right),$$ $\quad$ where $X_{a,b}$ is some constant real based on $a, b$ , which you need to define appropriately (probably different for every $(a,b)$ ), to prove that $f$ is infinitely differentiable, or if you want to prove that $f$ is not infinitely differentiable, you need to show that this is true for every choice for $X_{a,b}$ . $\quad$ (III) If $E$ is bounded above, $M=\sup E$ , then $f(x)=e^{-\frac{1}{(x-M)^2}}$ for $x > M$ . Similarly, $f(x)=e^{-\frac{1}{(x-N)^2}}$ if $E$ is bounded below and $\quad N=\inf E$ . MY ORIGINAL POST: Baby Rudin Ex. 5.21 - Assessment of a Proposed Partial Solution and Help Completing It This exercise is driving me crazy. I'm honestly ashamed to tell you how long I actually stack with this problem not continuing to study mathematics until I solve it. In many points a long the way I was very close to giving up and in many points I thought that I finally managed to solve the problem but then realized there is some mistake or a missing piece in the proof. The proposed solution here is the closest I managed to get at this point. At this point I decided it's time to ask for help on the last part missing from this proof and get some people to critic this partial proof in general. The Problem: Ex. 21, Chap. 5 Let $E$ be a closed subset of $\mathbb{R}$ . We saw in Exercise 22, Chap. 4, that there is a real continuous function $f$ on $\mathbb{R}$ whose zero set is $E$ . Is it possible, for each closed set $E$ , to find such an $f$ which is differentiable on $\mathbb{R}$ , or one which is $n$ times differentiable, or even one which has derivatives of all orders on $\mathbb{R}$ ? My Idea (Informally) I think such an infinitely differentable function does exist. I want to give you a visual explanation of how I thought of constructing this function before going to the formal solution. We obviously set $f$ to be 0 for all points of $E$ . For every open interval of points of $\mathbb{R} \setminus E$ , where the end points are points of $E$ , $f$ is a ""wave"" that smoothly approches 0 in the end points so that the derivative of any order on those end points is always 0. The shorter this open interval is, the smaller the maximum point of this ""wave"". If $E$ is bounded above, $f$ is just some increasing function after $\sup E$ , so that it smoothly approches 0 at $\sup E$ (the same goes if $E$ is bounded below). I drew an illustration of this idea: The red parts are points of $f(E)$ , the blue parts are points of $f(\mathbb{R} \setminus E)$ . $P$ is a limit point of $E$ . My Partial Solution My proof uses two previous results from the book and two additional lemmas. I shall present them here (and prove the lemmas) before going to the main proof. Ex. 5.9. Let $f$ be a continuous real function on $\mathbb{R}$ , of which it is known that $f'(x)$ exists for all $x \neq 0$ and that $f'(x) \to 3$ as $x \to 0$ . Does it follow that $f'(0)$ exists? In the solution to this exercise we saw that $f'(0)$ does in fact exists and is 3. In general to any real continuous function $f$ on $\mathbb{R}$ for which the derivative is known to exist except for a specific point $a$ and $f'(x) \to D$ as $x \to a$ , we can use the same proof we use in this exercise to show that $f'(a)$ exists and $f'(a)=D$ . Theorem 4.15. If $f$ is a continuous mapping of a compact metric space $X$ into $\mathbb{R}^k$ , then $f(X)$ is closed and bounded. Thus, $f$ is bounded. Lemma 1. Let $f, g: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ differentiable functions. Then, $$\left(f(x)^{g(x)}\right)' = f(x)^{g(x)}\left[g'(x)\ln(f(x)) + g(x)\frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}\right]$$ Proof. Let $h(x)=f(x)^{g(x)}$ , then $$\ln(h(x)) = \ln\left(f(x)^{g(x)}\right) = g(x)\ln(f(x)).$$ Differentiating both sides we get: $$\frac{h'(x)}{h(x)} = g'(x)\ln(f(x)) + g(x)\frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}.$$ Thus, $$h'(x) = f(x)^{g(x)}\left[g'(x)\ln(f(x)) + g(x)\frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}\right].$$ Lemma 2. Let $f,g : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ infinitely differentiable functions. Then, for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ : $\quad$ (a) $f+g$ is infinitely differentiable and $$(f+g)^{(n)}(x)=f^{(n)}(x)+g^{(n)}(x)$$ . $\quad$ (b) $f\cdot g$ is infinitely differentiable and $$(f\cdot g)^{(n)}(x)=\sum_{i=1}^{2^n} f^{\left(\alpha_{n_i}\right)}(x)\cdot g^{\left(\beta_{n_i}\right)}(x),$$ $\quad$ where $\{\alpha_{n_i}\}$ , $\{\beta_{n_i}\}$ are sequences of non-negative integers. $\quad$ (c) $\frac{f}{g}$ is infinitely differentiable whenever $g(x) \neq 0$ and $$\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)^{(n)}(x)=\frac{F_n(x)}{g^{2^n}(x)},$$ $\quad$ where $F_n$ is some infinitely differentiable function. $\quad$ (d) $f\circ g$ is infinitely differentiable and $$(f\circ g)^{(n)}(x)=\sum_{j=1}^{z_n}\prod_{i=1}^{m_{n_j}}t_{n_{j_i}},$$ $\quad$ for some $z_n \in \mathbb{N}$ , $m_{n_1} and \dots, m_{n_{z_n}} \in \mathbb{N}$ and where each term $t_{n_{j_i}}$ is either of the form $f^{(m)}(g(x))$ or $g^{(m)}(x)$ , $m$ a non-negative $\quad$ integer. Proof. We use induction for all 4 of the sections of this lemma. $\quad$ (a) For $n=1$ , $(f+g)'(x) = f'(x) + g'(x)$ . Suppose that $(f+g)^{(k)}(x)=f^{(k)}(x)+g^{(k)}(x)$ for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$ . Then, $$(f+g)^{(k+1)}(x)=\left(f^{(k)}(x)\right)' + \left(g^{(k)}(x)\right)' = f^{(k+1)}(x) + g^{(k+1)}(x).$$ $\quad$ (b) For $n=1$ , $(f \cdot g)'(x) = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)$ . Suppose that for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$ , there are sequences $\{\alpha_{k_i}\}$ , $\{\beta_{k_i}\}$ of non-negative integers such that $(f\cdot g)^{(k)}(x)=\sum_{i=1}^{2^k} f^{\left(\alpha_{k_i}\right)}(x)\cdot g^{\left(\beta_{k_i}\right)}(x)$ . Then, $$(f\cdot g)^{(k+1)}(x)=\sum_{i=1}^{2^k} f^{\left(\alpha_{k_i}+1\right)}(x)\cdot g^{\left(\beta_{k_i}\right)}(x) + f^{\left(\alpha_{k_i}\right)}(x)\cdot g^{\left(\beta_{k_i}+1\right)}(x).$$ Now, let $$\alpha_{\left(k+1\right)_i} = \begin{cases} \alpha_{k_i+1}, \quad 1 \leq i \leq 2^k\\ \alpha_{k_{\left(i-2^k\right)}}, \quad 2^k + 1 \leq i \leq 2^{k+1}, \end{cases}$$ $$\beta_{\left(k+1\right)_i} = \begin{cases} \beta_{k_i}, \quad 1 \leq i \leq 2^k\\ \beta_{k_{\left(i-2^k\right)}+1}, \quad 2^k + 1 \leq i \leq 2^{k+1}. \end{cases}$$ Thus, $$(f\cdot g)^{(k+1)}(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{2^{k+1}}f^{\left(\alpha_{(k+1)_i}\right)}(x)\cdot g^{\left(\beta_{(k+1)_i}\right)}(x).$$ $\quad$ (c) For $n=1$ , $\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)'(x) = \frac{f'(x)g(x)+f(x)g'(x)}{g^2(x)}$ . Suppose that for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$ , $\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)^{(k)}(x) = \frac{F_k(x)}{g^{2^k}(x)}$ , where $F_k$ is some infinitely differentiable function. Then, if we put $F_{k+1}(x) = F_k(x)g^{2^k}(x)-2^kg^{2^k-1}(x)g'(x)F_k(x)$ , we get the desired result that $$\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)^{(k+1)}(x) = \frac{F_{k+1}(x)}{g^{2^{k+1}}(x)}.$$ $\quad$ (d) For $n=1$ , $(f \circ g)'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$ . Suppose that for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$ , $(f\circ g)^{(k)}(x)=\sum_{j=1}^{z_k}\prod_{i=1}^{m_{k_j}}t_{k_{j_i}}$ for some $z_k \in \mathbb{N}$ , $m_{k_1} and \dots, m_{k_{z_k}} \in \mathbb{N}$ and where each term $t_{k_{j_i}}$ is either of the form $f^{(m)}(g(x))$ or $g^{(m)}(x)$ , $m$ a non-negative integer. Then, $(f\circ g)^{(k+1)}(x)=\sum_{j=1}^{z_k}\left(\prod_{s=1}^{m_{k_j}}t_{k_{j_s}}\right)'$ . We then prove by induction $$\bullet \quad \left(\prod_{i=1}^{m_{k_j}}t_{k_{j_i}}\right)' = \sum_{i=1}^{m}\left(\frac{t_{k_{j_i}}'}{t_{k_{j_i}}}\prod_{s=1}^{m_{k_j}}t_{k_{j_s}}\right) + \prod_{i=1}^{m}t_{k_{j_i}}\left(\prod_{i=m+1}^{m_{k_j}}t_{k_{j_i}}\right)',$$ for every $m,j \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $j \leq z_k$ and $m < m_{k_j}$ . For $m=1$ , $\left(\prod_{i=1}^{m_{k_j}}t_{k_{j_i}}\right)' = t_{k_{j_1}}'\prod_{i=2}^{m_{k_j}}t_{k_{j_i}} + t_{k_{j_1}}\left(\prod_{i=2}^{m_{k_j}}t_{k_{j_i}}\right)'$ . Suppose that $\bullet$ is true for some natural $m < m_{k_j}-1$ . Then, $$\begin{align*} \left(\prod_{i=1}^{m_{k_j}}t_{k_{j_i}}\right)'  & = \sum_{i=1}^{m}\left(\frac{t_{k_{j_i}}'}{t_{k_{j_i}}}\prod_{s=1}^{m_{k_j}}t_{k_{j_s}}\right) + \prod_{i=1}^{m}t_{k_{j_i}}\left[t_{k_{j_{m+1}}}'\left(\prod_{i=m+2}^{m_{k_j}}t_{k_{j_i}}\right) + t_{k_{j_{m+1}}}\left(\prod_{i=m+2}^{m_{k_j}}t_{k_{j_i}}\right)'\right]\\ & = \sum_{i=1}^{m+1}\left(\frac{t_{k_{j_i}}'}{t_{k_{j_i}}}\prod_{s=1}^{m_{k_j}}t_{k_{j_s}}\right) + \prod_{i=1}^{m+1}t_{k_{j_i}}\left(\prod_{i=m+2}^{m_{k_j}}t_{k_{j_i}}\right)'. \end{align*}$$ Then, if we put $m=m_{k_j}-1$ we get that $$\left(\prod_{i=1}^{m_{k_j}}t_{k_{j_i}}\right)' = \sum_{i=1}^{m_{k_j}}\left(\frac{t_{k_{j_i}}'}{t_{k_{j_i}}}\prod_{s=1}^{m_{k_j}}t_{k_{j_s}}\right).$$ Since $t_{k_{j_i}}'$ is either of the form $f^{(u)}(g(x))g'(x)$ or $g^{(u)}(x)$ , $u \in \mathbb{N}$ , $$ (f \circ g)^{(k+1)}(x) = \sum_{j=1}^{z_k}\sum_{i=1}^{m_{k_j}}\left(\frac{t_{k_{j_i}}'}{t_{k_{j_i}}}\prod_{s=1}^{m_{k_j}}t_{k_{j_s}}\right) $$ can clearly be arranged in our desired form. The main proof. Yes, such a function which is infinitely differentiable exists. We shall construct an example. Let $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be closed. Defining $f$ For the trivial case that $E=\emptyset$ take $f(x)=1$ . Otherwise, we define $f$ by 3 cases: $\quad$ (I) If $x \in E$ , $f(x) = 0$ . $\quad$ (II) If $x \in (a,b)$ , where $a,b \in E$ and $(a,b) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus E$ , define $$F_{a,b}(x) = \frac{\pi}{b-a}\left(x + \frac{3b-5a}{2}\right),$$ $\quad$ and then $$f(x) = X_{a,b}\cos^{F_{a,b}(x)}\left(F_{a,b}(x)\right),$$ $\quad$ where $X_{a,b}$ is some constant real based on $a, b$ , which for now is irrelevant. We shall define $X_{a,b}$ later in the proof when its value will be $\quad$ relevant. $\quad$ (III) If $E$ is bounded above, $M=\sup E$ , then $f(x)=e^{-\frac{1}{(x-M)^2}}$ for $x > M$ . Similarly, $f(x)=e^{-\frac{1}{(x-N)^2}}$ if $E$ is bounded below and $\quad N=\inf E$ . Clearly $f$ is defined for every $x \in E$ . $f$ is also defined for every $x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus E$ because such $x$ have some neighborhood in $\mathbb{R} \setminus E$ , otherwise $x$ would be a limit point of $E$ and therefore contained in $E$ . $E$ is the zero-set of $f$ To show that $E=Z(f)$ , we need to show that $x \not\in E$ implies $f(x) \neq 0$ . For $x$ in case (II) $$* \quad \frac{3}{2}\pi < F_{a,b}(x) < \frac{5}{2}\pi, $$ therefore $f(x)>0$ . For $x$ in case (III) clearly $f(x)>0$ as well. $f$ is infinitely differentiable we treat points of $E$ and points of $\mathbb{R} \setminus E$ separately. Points of $\mathbb{R} \setminus E$ : $\quad$ For $x$ in case (II), $f(x)=X_{a,b}\cos^{F_{a,b}(x)}\left(F_{a,b}(x)\right)$ . To derive $f'(x)$ , we first note that $$F_{a,b}'(x)=\frac{\pi}{b-a}$$ and using lemma 1 $$\left(\cos^x(x)\right)' = \cos^x(x)\left(\ln\left(\cos x\right)-x\tan x\right).$$ We now prove by induction that for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ , $f^{(n)}(x)$ exists and $f^{(n)}(x) = f(x)\cdot f_n(x)$ , where $f_n$ is some infinitely differentiable function. For $n=1$ , $$f'(x) = f(x)\left[\ln\left(\cos F_{a,b}(x)\right) - F_{a,b}(x)\tan F_{a,b}(x)\right]\frac{\pi}{b-a},$$ and we denote $f_1(x) = \frac{\pi}{b-a}\left[\ln\left(\cos F_{a,b}(x)\right) - F_{a,b}(x)\tan F_{a,b}(x)\right]$ . From $*$ it follows that $\cos F_{a,b}(x) > 0$ , hence $\ln\cos F_{a,b}(x)$ is well defined and is infinitely differentiable by lemma 2(d). Then, additionally using lemmas 2(a),(b),(d) we see that $f_1$ is infinitely differentiable. Suppose that for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$ $f^{(k)}(x)=f(x)f_k(x)$ , where $f_k$ is some infinitely differentiable function. Then, $$\begin{align*} f^{(k+1)}(x) &= f'(x)f_k(x) + f(x)f_k'(x)\\ &= f(x)(f_1(x)f_k(x) + f_k'(x)). \end{align*}$$ Denoting $f_{k+1}(x) = f_1(x)f_k(x)+f_k'(x)$ , it's clear from lemmas 2(b),(c) that $f_{k+1}$ is infinitely differentiable. $\quad$ For $x$ in case (III), suppose without loss of generality that $E$ is bounded above and $x > M$ . Then, since $e^x$ and $-\frac{1}{(x-M)^2}$ are infinitely differentiable (for $x \neq M$ ) we can use lemma 2(d) to get that $f(x)$ is infinitely differentiable. Points of $E$ : We shall describe the area ""to the left"" and ""to the right"" of $x$ . Given $d > 0$ , we denote $l_d=(x-d,x)$ and $r_d=(x,x+d)$ . Then, we claim that there is some $\varepsilon_0>0$ , such that at least one of the following must be true: $\quad$ (1) $\quad$ $l_{\varepsilon_0} \subseteq E$ . $\quad$ (2) $\quad$ $l_{\varepsilon_0} \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus E$ . $\quad$ (3) $\quad$ For all $0<\varepsilon\leq \varepsilon_0$ , there's some $t \in l_\varepsilon$ such that $t \in E$ . And the same goes for ""the right side"" of $x$ . To show that one of these options must be true, suppose by contradiction that they're all false. Then, since (3) is false, (2) is true and that's a contradiction. $\quad$ We shall prove that for every non-negative integer $n$ , $f^{(n)}(t) \to 0$ as $t \to x$ . Then we use it to prove by induction that $f^{(n)}(x)=0$ and therefore $f^{(n)}(x)$ exists. Here is this induction proof: For $n=0$ we already know that $f(x)=0$ . Suppose that for some non-negative integer $k$ , $f^{(k)}(x)=0$ . Then, since $f^{(k)}(t) \to 0$ as $t \to x$ it follows that $f^{(k)}$ is continuous at $x$ and since we know that $f^{(k+1)}$ exists for points of $\mathbb{R} \setminus E$ , $f^{(k)}$ is continuous. Then, since $f^{(k+1)}(t) \to 0$ as $t \to x$ , using Ex.9 it follows that $f^{(k+1)}(x)=0$ . $\quad$ If (1) is true, then $f$ is $0$ constant in $l_{\varepsilon_0}$ , therefore for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ $f^{(n)}$ is 0 constant as well. Thus, for every non-negative integer $n$ , $f^{(n)}(t) \to 0$ as $t \to x$ for $x \in l_{\varepsilon_0}$ . This argument of course can be applied to $r_{\varepsilon_0}$ as well. $\quad$ If (2) is true, then either $x=N=\inf E$ or $x=b$ for some $(a,b)$ as in case (II). If $x=b$ , denote $w(z)=X_{a,b}\cos^{F_{a,b}(z)}\left(F_{a,b}(z)\right)$ , for $z \in [a,b]$ (note that $w=f$ on $[a,b]$ ). Then, since $w$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ (composition of continuous functions is continuous, $\lim_{t \to x}f(t) = 0$ , for $t \in l_{\varepsilon_0}$ . Since $w^{(n)}(t) = w(t)\cdot f_n(t)$ and $w^{(n+1)}(t)$ exists for all non-negative integer $n$ and $t \in [a,b]$ , it follows that $w^{(n)}$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ , therefore $f^{(n)}(t) \to w^{(n)}(x) = 0$ as $t \to x$ for $t \in l_{\varepsilon_0}$ . If $x=N$ , then $f(t)=e^{-\frac{1}{(t-N)^2}}$ , for $t \in l_{\varepsilon_0}$ . Then, we show that $f^{(n)}(t) = f(t)\cdot p_n(t)$ , where $p_n(t)$ is some polynomial of $\frac{1}{t-N}$ . We use induction: For $n=1$ , $f'(t) = f(t)\cdot 2\left(\frac{1}{t-N}\right)^3$ . If for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$ , $f^{(n)} = f(t)p_k(t)$ , where $p_k(t) = \sum_{j=0}^{i}c_j\left(\frac{1}{t-N}\right)^j$ , $i \in \mathbb{N}$ and $c_0, \dots, c_i \in \mathbb{R}$ . Then, $$\begin{align*} f^{(k+1)}(t)  &= f(t)2\left(\frac{1}{t-N}\right)^3\sum_{j=0}^{i}c_j\left(\frac{1}{t-N}\right)^j + f(t)\sum_{j=0}^{i}jc_j\left(\frac{1}{t-N}\right)^{j-1}\\ &= f(t)\underbrace{\left[\sum_{j=0}^{i}2c_j\left(\frac{1}{t-N}\right)^{j+3} + \sum_{j=0}^{i}jc_j\left(\frac{1}{t-N}\right)^{j-1}\right]}_{\text{clearly a polynomial of } \frac{1}{t-N}} \end{align*}$$ Now, if we prove that $\lim_{t \to N}\frac{f(t)}{|t-N|^m} = 0$ , for every $m \in \mathbb{N}$ , then clearly $f^{(n)}(t) \to 0$ as $t \to x$ for $t \in l_{\varepsilon_0}$ . $$ \lim_{t \to N}\frac{f(t)}{|t-N|^m} = \lim_{t \to N}\frac{e^{-\frac{1}{|t-N|^2}}}{|t-N|^m} = \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{e^{-\frac{1}{h^2}}}{h^m} = \lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{n^{\frac{m}{2}}}{e^n}. $$ If $m=2z$ , for some $z \in \mathbb{N}$ , we apply l'Hôpital's rule $z$ times and get that $$\lim_{t \to N}\frac{f(t)}{|t-N|^m} = \lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{z!}{e^n} = 0.$$ If $m=2z-1$ , for some $z \in \mathbb{N}$ , we apply l'Hôpital's rule $z$ times and get that $$\lim_{t \to N}\frac{f(t)}{|t-N|^m} =  \lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{\left(\frac{m}{2}\right)\left(\frac{m}{2}-1\right)\cdots\frac{1}{2}}{\sqrt{n}e^n} = 0.$$ In a very similar way we can prove this for $r_{\varepsilon_0}$ when either $x=a$ or $x=M=\sup E$ . The missing piece from the proof The last thing left to prove which I didn't mange to prove is that $f^{(n)}(t) \to 0$ as $t \to x$ for points $x \in E$ for which (3) is true. I should show how I tried to do it and what I did manage to show, that perhaps could be useful: $\quad$ Suppose (3) is true (but (1) is false). We should now define $X_{a,b}$ . Let $n_{a,b} \in \mathbb{N}$ be the smallest integer such that $\frac{1}{n_{a,b}} < b-a$ . Since $f_n$ is differentiable on $[a,b]$ , $f_n$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ , therefore by Theorem 4.15, there's some $M_n \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $\left|f_n(t)\right| \leq M_n$ for all $t \in [a,b]$ (notice that $f_n$ is independent of the value of $X_{a,b}$ ). Similarly, there is some $M_* \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $\left|\cos^{F_{a,b}(t)}\left(F_{a,b}(t)\right)\right| \leq M_*$ for all $t \in [a,b]$ . Put $M_{a,b} = \max \{M_n|n \leq n_{a,b}\}$ . Finally, we define $$X_{a,b} = \frac{1}{n_{a,b}M_*M_{a,b}}.$$ We shall now use this definition of $X_{a,b}$ to demonstrate that for every $d > 0$ , there is some $\delta > 0$ such that if $t \in l_\delta$ and $t \not\in E$ , then $|f^{(n)}(t)|< d$ . Given $d > 0$ , there is some $x_d \in l_d$ , such that $x_d \in E$ . Put $\delta = x - x_d$ . If $t \in l_\delta$ and $t \not\in E$ , then $t \in (a,b)$ as in (II), where $b-a \leq \delta$ . Thus $$ |f^{(n)}(t)|= X_{a,b}|f_n(t)|\left|\cos^{F_{a,b}(t)}\left(F_{a,b}(t)\right)\right| \leq \frac{1}{n_{a,b}M_*M_{a,b}}M_*M_{a,b} = \frac{1}{n_{a,b}} < b-a \leq \delta < d .$$ For points $t$ for which (1) is true we know that $f^{(n)}(t) = 0$ , so there's no problem there. But the problem is points for which only (3) is true. We don't know that they are 0 (we only think they suppose to be 0), but how can we prove this? It seems a bit circular. What I'm Asking For I have a few questions / things I want to get in an answer to this question: General assessment / critique of the incomplete proof (ignore the missing piece): I would like to get your opinion about every aspect of this proof - soundness, rigor, style, clarity and any other possible aspect you can think of. And most importantly is there some big unfixable mistake in this proof? Do you have a proposal to solve the missing piece? If needed feel free to change the definition of the coefficient $X_{a,b}$ as you see fit. If you think there's no way to solve this missing piece and this construction simply doesn't work, please don't suggest me a completely different solution to this exercise, I can look for solutions online, that's not a problem. Instead, please prove why this construction can't work for any choice of $X_{a,b}$ . How long does such a question should take to solve for a first time analysis student? Does it make sense that a single exercise would take so much time and effort, even when we talk about Rudin?","THE NEW (MUCH SHORTER) POST My original post perhaps was too long for most people, and understandably not a lot of people tried to go over it. In this new post my question is much shorter please prove or disprove that following function is infinitely differentiable on , or alternatively answer my original post (it is below here), which basically means helping me completing my proposed proof. Even if you don't want to answer my original post because it 's too long, it might be worth at least looking at some of it, because it could be useful. Let be some closed set of real numbers. Then, we define by 3 cases: (I) If , . (II) If , where and , define and then where is some constant real based on , which you need to define appropriately (probably different for every ), to prove that is infinitely differentiable, or if you want to prove that is not infinitely differentiable, you need to show that this is true for every choice for . (III) If is bounded above, , then for . Similarly, if is bounded below and . MY ORIGINAL POST: Baby Rudin Ex. 5.21 - Assessment of a Proposed Partial Solution and Help Completing It This exercise is driving me crazy. I'm honestly ashamed to tell you how long I actually stack with this problem not continuing to study mathematics until I solve it. In many points a long the way I was very close to giving up and in many points I thought that I finally managed to solve the problem but then realized there is some mistake or a missing piece in the proof. The proposed solution here is the closest I managed to get at this point. At this point I decided it's time to ask for help on the last part missing from this proof and get some people to critic this partial proof in general. The Problem: Ex. 21, Chap. 5 Let be a closed subset of . We saw in Exercise 22, Chap. 4, that there is a real continuous function on whose zero set is . Is it possible, for each closed set , to find such an which is differentiable on , or one which is times differentiable, or even one which has derivatives of all orders on ? My Idea (Informally) I think such an infinitely differentable function does exist. I want to give you a visual explanation of how I thought of constructing this function before going to the formal solution. We obviously set to be 0 for all points of . For every open interval of points of , where the end points are points of , is a ""wave"" that smoothly approches 0 in the end points so that the derivative of any order on those end points is always 0. The shorter this open interval is, the smaller the maximum point of this ""wave"". If is bounded above, is just some increasing function after , so that it smoothly approches 0 at (the same goes if is bounded below). I drew an illustration of this idea: The red parts are points of , the blue parts are points of . is a limit point of . My Partial Solution My proof uses two previous results from the book and two additional lemmas. I shall present them here (and prove the lemmas) before going to the main proof. Ex. 5.9. Let be a continuous real function on , of which it is known that exists for all and that as . Does it follow that exists? In the solution to this exercise we saw that does in fact exists and is 3. In general to any real continuous function on for which the derivative is known to exist except for a specific point and as , we can use the same proof we use in this exercise to show that exists and . Theorem 4.15. If is a continuous mapping of a compact metric space into , then is closed and bounded. Thus, is bounded. Lemma 1. Let differentiable functions. Then, Proof. Let , then Differentiating both sides we get: Thus, Lemma 2. Let infinitely differentiable functions. Then, for every : (a) is infinitely differentiable and . (b) is infinitely differentiable and where , are sequences of non-negative integers. (c) is infinitely differentiable whenever and where is some infinitely differentiable function. (d) is infinitely differentiable and for some , and where each term is either of the form or , a non-negative integer. Proof. We use induction for all 4 of the sections of this lemma. (a) For , . Suppose that for some . Then, (b) For , . Suppose that for some , there are sequences , of non-negative integers such that . Then, Now, let Thus, (c) For , . Suppose that for some , , where is some infinitely differentiable function. Then, if we put , we get the desired result that (d) For , . Suppose that for some , for some , and where each term is either of the form or , a non-negative integer. Then, . We then prove by induction for every such that and . For , . Suppose that is true for some natural . Then, Then, if we put we get that Since is either of the form or , , can clearly be arranged in our desired form. The main proof. Yes, such a function which is infinitely differentiable exists. We shall construct an example. Let be closed. Defining For the trivial case that take . Otherwise, we define by 3 cases: (I) If , . (II) If , where and , define and then where is some constant real based on , which for now is irrelevant. We shall define later in the proof when its value will be relevant. (III) If is bounded above, , then for . Similarly, if is bounded below and . Clearly is defined for every . is also defined for every because such have some neighborhood in , otherwise would be a limit point of and therefore contained in . is the zero-set of To show that , we need to show that implies . For in case (II) therefore . For in case (III) clearly as well. is infinitely differentiable we treat points of and points of separately. Points of : For in case (II), . To derive , we first note that and using lemma 1 We now prove by induction that for every , exists and , where is some infinitely differentiable function. For , and we denote . From it follows that , hence is well defined and is infinitely differentiable by lemma 2(d). Then, additionally using lemmas 2(a),(b),(d) we see that is infinitely differentiable. Suppose that for some , where is some infinitely differentiable function. Then, Denoting , it's clear from lemmas 2(b),(c) that is infinitely differentiable. For in case (III), suppose without loss of generality that is bounded above and . Then, since and are infinitely differentiable (for ) we can use lemma 2(d) to get that is infinitely differentiable. Points of : We shall describe the area ""to the left"" and ""to the right"" of . Given , we denote and . Then, we claim that there is some , such that at least one of the following must be true: (1) . (2) . (3) For all , there's some such that . And the same goes for ""the right side"" of . To show that one of these options must be true, suppose by contradiction that they're all false. Then, since (3) is false, (2) is true and that's a contradiction. We shall prove that for every non-negative integer , as . Then we use it to prove by induction that and therefore exists. Here is this induction proof: For we already know that . Suppose that for some non-negative integer , . Then, since as it follows that is continuous at and since we know that exists for points of , is continuous. Then, since as , using Ex.9 it follows that . If (1) is true, then is constant in , therefore for every is 0 constant as well. Thus, for every non-negative integer , as for . This argument of course can be applied to as well. If (2) is true, then either or for some as in case (II). If , denote , for (note that on ). Then, since is continuous on (composition of continuous functions is continuous, , for . Since and exists for all non-negative integer and , it follows that is continuous on , therefore as for . If , then , for . Then, we show that , where is some polynomial of . We use induction: For , . If for some , , where , and . Then, Now, if we prove that , for every , then clearly as for . If , for some , we apply l'Hôpital's rule times and get that If , for some , we apply l'Hôpital's rule times and get that In a very similar way we can prove this for when either or . The missing piece from the proof The last thing left to prove which I didn't mange to prove is that as for points for which (3) is true. I should show how I tried to do it and what I did manage to show, that perhaps could be useful: Suppose (3) is true (but (1) is false). We should now define . Let be the smallest integer such that . Since is differentiable on , is continuous on , therefore by Theorem 4.15, there's some such that for all (notice that is independent of the value of ). Similarly, there is some such that for all . Put . Finally, we define We shall now use this definition of to demonstrate that for every , there is some such that if and , then . Given , there is some , such that . Put . If and , then as in (II), where . Thus For points for which (1) is true we know that , so there's no problem there. But the problem is points for which only (3) is true.

37,Proof of inequality in Weierstrass approximation theorem proof through probability,Proof of inequality in Weierstrass approximation theorem proof through probability,,"I found this exercise in my probability theory book. The problem guides you through a proof of the Weierstrass Approximation Theorem through probability theory. My question is only about part b, so any help or hint is much appreciated. I can make the exercise, except for part $b$, and I show all my workings below. I understand that you might want to see my workings for $b$, but I have really no idea. First I quote Chebyshev's inequality, because apparently we need this. Thus: my question is only about part b, my work for the other parts can be found below. $\bf{Chebyshev's \ inequality}$ If $Y$ is a random variable and $\mathbb{E}(Y^2)<\infty$, then $$\mathbb{P}(|Y|\geq t)\leq \frac{\mathbb{E}(Y^2)}{t^2}, \quad \mathrm{for \ } t>0.$$ I quote the exercise: Let ($X_i$) be a sequence of i.i.d. Bernoulli$(p)$ variables, thus $\mathbb{P}(X_i=0)=1-p$ and $\mathbb{P}(X_i=1)=p$, for all $i\in\mathbb{N}$. a) Let $f$ be a continuous function of $[0,1]$ and prove that $$B_n(p)=\mathbb{E}\left(f\left(\frac{\sum_{i=1}^nX_i}{n}\right)\right)$$ is a polynomial in $p$ of degree at most $n$. b) Use Chebyshev's inequality to prove that for all $p$ such that $0\leq p\leq1$ and for any $\epsilon>0$, $$\sum_{k\in K}\binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}\leq\frac{1}{4n\epsilon^2},$$ where $K=\{k:0\leq k\leq n, |k/n-p|>\epsilon\}$. c) Using this and the fact that $f$ is bounded and uniformly continuous on $[0,1]$, prove the following version of the Weierstrass approximation theorem: $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\sup_{0\leq p\leq1}|f(p)-B_n(p)|=0.$$ For part $a$, if we let $Y_n:=\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$, then $Y_n\sim \mathrm{Bin}(n,p)$. Thus $$B_n(p)=\mathbb{E}\left(f\left(\frac{\sum_{i=1}^nX_i}{n}\right)\right)=\mathbb{E}\left(f\left(\frac{Y_n}{n}\right)\right)=\sum_{k=0}^n f\left(\frac{k}{n}\right)\binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^k$$ is a polynomial in $p$ of degree at most $n$. This follows directly from just writing out the expectation of the binomial distribution. For part $c$, $f$ is continuous on the closed interval $[0,1]$, so $f$ is uniformly continuous and bounded on $[0,1]$, and assumes it's minimum and maximum on this interval. These are all basic real analysis results. Since $f$ is bounded on $[0,1]$, there exists an $M\in\mathbb{R}$ such that $|f(p)|\leq M$, for all $p\in[0,1]$. From part $b$, we know that $0\leq p\leq1$ and for any $\epsilon>0$, $$\sum_{k\in K}\binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}=\mathbb{P}(|k/n-p|\geq \epsilon)\leq\frac{1}{4n\epsilon^2},$$ where $K=\{k:0\leq k\leq n, |k/n-p|>\epsilon\}$. Thus we obtain the following: In equation 1, we take the limit of the result of part b; equation 2 follows because of uniform continuity of $f$; equation 4 follows because of linearity of expectation, part $a$ and because $f(p)$ is fixed; equation 5 follows from the partition theorem for expectations:  $$\begin{align}  &\lim_{n\to\infty}\mathbb{P}(|\frac{k}{n}-p|\geq\epsilon) = 0 & (1)\\  &\lim_{n\to\infty}\mathbb{P}\left(|f\left(\frac{k}{n}\right)-f(p)|\geq\epsilon\right) = 0 & (2)\\  &\lim_{n\to\infty}\mathbb{E}\left(|f\left(\frac{k}{n}\right)-f(p)|\right)  = & (3)\\ &\lim_{n\to\infty}|B_n(p)-f(p)|=& (4)\\   &\lim_{n\to\infty}\mathbb{E}\left(|f\left(k/n\right)-f(p)|\Bigg|k/n-p|\geq\epsilon\right)\cdot\mathbb{P}(|k/n-p|\geq\epsilon)+& \\ &\lim_{n\to\infty}\mathbb{E}\left(|f\left(k/n\right)-f(p)|\Bigg|\frac{k}{n}-p|<\epsilon\right)\cdot\mathbb{P}(|k/n-p|<\epsilon)=& (5)\\  & 0+0=0.& (6)\\ \end{align}$$ The first term is zero because $\mathbb{P}(|\frac{k}{n}-p|\geq\epsilon)$ goes to zero as $n$ goes to $\infty$, as shown in part $b$, and because the boundedness of $f$. The second term goes to zero because: (i) $f(k/n)-f(p)$ goes to zero as $n$ goes to infinity because $f$ is uniformly continuous, because $\lim_{n\to\infty}k/n=p$ because of the law of large numbers (remember that $k$ denotes the number of successes in a $\mathrm{Bin}(n,p)$ experiment); and (ii) because $\mathbb{P}(|k/n-p|<\epsilon)$ is bounded by definition of a probability measure. Thus $\lim_{n\to\infty}|B_n(p)-f(p)|=0$, for any $p\in[0,1]$, which is the interval where $f$ is uniformly continuous, and thus $\lim_{n\to\infty}\sup_{0\leq p\leq1}|f(p)-B_n(p)|=0$. Thus any continuous function on $[0,1]$ can be uniformly approximated by polyinomials on $[0,1]$. Obvious rescaling proves the Weierstrass Approximation Theorem.

40,Why is this a safe neighborhood for uniform convergence of the sequence implicitly defining a function?,Why is this a safe neighborhood for uniform convergence of the sequence implicitly defining a function?,,"This discussion pertains to Theorem III-1.4 in C.H. Edwards, Jr.'s Advanced Calculus of Several Variables. I am trying to understand why the neighborhood described in the proof of the implicit function theorem is ""safe"" for convergence of the contraction mapping with the inductive hypothesis for the sequence : $f_{n+1}[x]=f_{n}[x]-\frac{G[x,f_{n}[x]]}{D_{2}G[a,b]}$, $f_{0}[x]=b$. The neighborhood is given as follows: $\varepsilon\ge\lvert x-a\rvert\bigwedge\varepsilon\ge\lvert y-b\rvert\implies\lvert D_{2}G[x,y]-D_{2}G[a,b]\rvert\le\frac{1}{2}\lvert D_{2}G[a,b]\rvert$ $\varepsilon>\delta\ge\lvert x-a\rvert\implies\lvert G[x,b]\rvert\le\frac{1}{2}\varepsilon\lvert D_{2}G[a,b]\rvert$ The graph depicts the trace on the surface $\{x,y,G[x,y]\}$ of the square $[a-\varepsilon,a+\varepsilon]\times[b-\varepsilon,b+\varepsilon]$ in green. The further $\delta$ restriction is indicated in magenta, as is the trace of the line $y=b$. The trace of $x=a$ is blue. The white angle represents the projection of the point $\{a,b+\frac{\varepsilon}{2},\frac{\varepsilon}{2}D_{2}G[a,b]\}$. $\frac{\varepsilon}{2}D_{2}G[a,b]$ also gives the height of the upper plane. The actual solution curve $\{x,f[x],0\}$ is the intersection of the lower plane and the surface $\{x,y,G[x,y]\}$. The red parallelogram represents the condition $G[a,y]=2(y-b)D_{2}G[a,y]$ which leads to an infinite loop. The choice of $\varepsilon$ prevents that from happening on the blue curve. This is explained in my answer to a previous question: Neighborhoods necessary for convergence of a sequence. What I am trying to determine is why the rectangle $[a-\delta,a+\delta]\times[b-\varepsilon,b+\varepsilon]$ is safe for convergence for all $x\in[a-\delta,a+\delta]$. In other words, how it avoids the infinite loop condition. A second diagram shows a simpler depiction of the problem using a different $G[x,y]$.

The rectangle in that image was chosen so that the trace of the line segment $G[{c_1,d_1},{c_2,d_1}]$ is completely below the plane $z=0$, and $G[{c_1,d_2},{c_2,d_2}]$ is completely above the surface of $z=0$. $D_2[x,y]>0$ holds everywhere in the rectangle $[c_1,c_2]\times[d_1,d_2]$.

The neighborhood described above would lie within that rectangle. Edit to add: Edit to modify: I observe that the portions of the green curve with constant $x$ never intersect the plane $z=0$ in the neighborhood, so it is right to exclude them.

Edit to add: Another observation that seems significant is that all sequences begin with the base state $f_0[x]=b$. I'm pretty sure that means all subsequent $f_n[x]$ will be on the same side of the plane $y=b$ as $f_1[x]$. Unfortunately I don't have a good exact vocabulary, nor theory of this problem domain.

However, I want to understand what condition on $f$, in addition to given continuity , is required for piecewise monotonicity. So far I understand that continuity is not enough since it does not exclude the possibility of nowhere differentiable functions such as this. Also, requiring $f$ to be differentiable is not enough as it can be everywhere differentiable but nowhere monotonic.

When I think of ""ratios"" $x/y$ and $z/w$ as being ""equal"", with $x$, $y$, $z$, and $w$ being real numbers, this means the results of dividing the real numbers $x$ by $y$ and $z$ by $w$ are equal. Or that $xw = yz$, from manipulation of the fractions. Intuitively, we may say this means the ""scale factor"" going from $y$ to $x$ is the same as that going from $w$ to $z$, or that $x$ has as many ""units"" of size $y$ (allowing for non-integral numbers of units) as $z$ has of size $w$. Yet, Euclid (~300 BCE) did not have real-number arithmetic to work with. Instead he had various kinds of ""magnitudes"", like line segments and shapes with areas and other things that had a kind of ""size"" to them. So he had to do something else, and this I don't get. If we have ""magnitudes"" $x$, $y$, $z$, and $w$, which for modern purposes could be taken as nonnegative real numbers, then we say $x/y = z/w$ iff for every pair of nonzero natural numbers $m$ and $n$, $mx < ny \rightarrow mz < nw$, $mx = ny \rightarrow mz = nw$, and $mx > ny \rightarrow mz > nw$.

76,Proof that all Cauchy sequences converge,Proof that all Cauchy sequences converge,,"I am supposed to prove that all Cauchy sequences converge, using the fact that a sequence converges iff its lim sup equals its lim inf. I think the proof I have works, but the one given in the solutions is different, so I'd like to make sure. Also, this is for a calculus class, not real analysis, so I don't know about metric spaces or any of that. I believe the problem pertains solely to sequences in $\mathbb{R}$. We have the Cauchy sequence $\{a_n\}$. By the definition of the Cauchy sequence, we have $$\left|a_m-a_n\right|<\frac{\epsilon}{3}$$ for a given $\epsilon>0$ and $m,n>N$. There exist the numbers $\inf_{n>N}\{a_n\}$ and $\sup_{n>N}\{a_n\}$, that is to say, the infimum and supremum of the sequence with the first $N$ terms truncated. By the definition of the infimum, we must have $$\left| a_{low}-\inf_{n>N}\{a_n\}\right|<\frac{\epsilon}{3}$$ for some $a_{low} \in \{a_n|n>N\}$, because otherwise $\inf_{n>N}\{a_n\}+\frac{\epsilon}{3}$ would be a greater lower bound for $\{a_n|n>N\}$ than the infimum, a contradiction. By the same reasoning, we also have $$\left|\sup_{n>N}\{a_n\}-a_{high}\right|<\frac{\epsilon}{3}$$ for some $a_{high} \in \{a_n|n>N\}$.

By the definition of the infinite limit, then, because we can make the difference of the infimum and the supremum arbitrarily close to zero by increasing $N$, we have $$\lim_{N \rightarrow \infty}\left( \sup_{n>N}\{a_n\}-\inf_{n>N}\{a_n\} \right)=\lim_{N \rightarrow \infty}\sup_{n>N}\{a_n\}-\lim_{N \rightarrow \infty}\inf_{n>N}\{a_n\}=0$$ So the lim inf of any Cauchy sequence equals its lim sup, and therefore it converges.","I am supposed to prove that all Cauchy sequences converge, using the fact that a sequence converges iff its lim sup equals its lim inf.

Help in proving.,,"I am studying the properties of a particular class of functions, and I'd appreciate some help in proving a property of that class.

Definition Let $f \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a function, consider a point $x \in \mathbb{R}$ where $f$ is continuous, then the following two statements are equivalent. $Cf(x) = k$, where $k \in \{0\}\bigcup\mathbb{N}\bigcup\{\infty\}$. The function is continuous at $x$ and the maximum number of times $f$ is differentiable at $x$ is $k$. Clarification (Added) $Cf(x)=k$, where we know that $f$ is a function and $x$ is the point in its domain, then it means that the maximum number of times $f$ is differentiable at $x$ is $k$. This is not a good notation as someone could think that $Cf$ itself is one function different from f and not associated with it, but here I intended that $C$ tells about a proprty of the function at a point in its domain.....not a convincing notation......but i'd like know any ideas to make a good notation for it. Definition of a class of functions The set $S$ consists of functions $f \colon (0,1) \to \mathbb{R}$, which satisfy the following properties. Given any $f \in S$ there exist a countable dense subset $D \subset (0,1)$ and maps $k,ck$ defined as $k \colon D \to \mathbb{N}$ and $ck \colon (0,1) \to \mathbb{N}\bigcup\{\infty\}$ which satisfy the following properties. $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$, the pre-image $k^{-1}(\{n\})$ is a finite set. $\forall x \in $D$, ck(x) \ge k(x)$ but finite and $\forall x \in (0,1)$\D$, ck(x) = \infty$. $\forall x \in (0,1), Cf(x) = ck(x)$ Whenever $Cf(x) = k$ is finite, for the $(k+1)^{nth}$ derivative of $f$ at $x$, the left and right limits exist and are not equal. (the left and right limits do not diverge). Let $S_p$ be the set of all functions $f_p$ which are periodic versions of the functions $f \in S$. The periodic version $f_p$ of the function $f \in S$ is defined as $f_p(x) = f(x) \forall x \in (0,1)$, $f_p(0) = f(0+)$ and $f_p(1) = f_p(0)$ and $ \forall x \in \mathbb{R}, f_p(x) = f_p(x+1)$. Closure property under addition EDIT : (This argument is false and the set $S_{pc}$ is not closed under addition) (see comment by Andrew) Let $f_1,f_2 \in S_p$ such that $f_1$ is not same as $-f_2$. I am able to prove that if $f_3 = f_1 + f_2$, then $f_3 \in S_p$, by making the following considerations. Let $D_1,k_1,ck_1$ be the required set and maps respectively for the function $f_1$ as per the definitions given above. Let $D_2,k_2,ck_2$ be the required set and maps of $f_2$. Let $D_3,k_3,ck_3$ be defined as below. $D_3 = D_1 \bigcup D_2$. Let $l_1 \colon (0,1) \to \mathbb{N}\bigcup\{\infty\}$ and $l_2 \colon (0,1) \to \mathbb{N}\bigcup\{\infty\}$ are defined as $l_1(x) = k_1(x)$ if $x \in D_1$ otherwise $\infty$. $l_2(x) = k_2(x)$ if $x \in D_2$ otherwise $\infty$. $k_3(x)$ is assigned as $k_3(x) = \min\{l_1(x),l_2(x)\}$ and Let $m_1 \colon (0,1) \to \mathbb{N}\bigcup\{\infty\}$ and $m_2 \colon (0,1) \to \mathbb{N}\bigcup\{\infty\}$ are defined as $m_1(x) = ck_1(x)$ if $x \in D_1$ otherwise $\infty$. $m_2(x) = ck_2(x)$ if $x \in D_2$ otherwise $\infty$. $ck_3(x)$ is assigned as $ck_3(x) = \min\{m_1(x),m_2(x)\}$. By assigning $D_3,k_3,ck_3$ as mentioned above I am able to prove that $f_3 \in S_p$. To get the closure property under addition, we can add the set of all constant functions $K$ to the set $S_p$ to form a new set $S_{pc}$. Hence I am able to prove that the set $S_{pc}$ as defined above is closed under the addition operation (and it easily follows that the set $S_{pc}$ is closed under the multiplication operation as well). There by I am able to show that the set $S_{pc}$ is indeed a vector space. (as it cab be easily seen that the set $S_{pc}$ is closed under scalar multiplication).
