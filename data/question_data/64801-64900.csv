0,Painting the board by selecting $2\times 2$ type squares from the $m\times n$ type board,Painting the board by selecting  type squares from the  type board,2\times 2 m\times n,"Problem: Initially we have an $m\times n$ board with all unit squares white. As a result, we want to paint any two squares with a common edge, one black and one white. (That is, we want to get it like a chessboard pattern after the final step.) In each step of the painting process, a $2\times 2$ square is selected on the board and its white unit squares are painted black and its black unit squares painted white. For which $(m, n)$ pairs can the board be painted as desired? Note: I solved some parts of the problem. I'm adding them to the post. Remaining part of the problem is at the bottom of the page. Thanks. My attempts and some parts about the solution: For $4\mid m$ and $4 \mid n$ , it is possible.

How many words can we assemble without the substrings $'ab'$ and $'bc'$ ? define the recursive formula. define the generating function for this formula. $Solution.A.$ For the first sub-question, we consider 3 disjoint cases: $$a_{n}^{c}=\text{the number of valid words with length of $n$, starting with 'c' }$$ $$a_{n}^{b}=\text{the number of valid words with length of $n$, starting with 'b' }$$ $$a_{n}^{a}=\text{the number of valid words with length of $n$, starting with 'a' }$$ For the first case, we can add $'c'$ at the beginning of the word and then take a valid word with a length of $n-1$ . Therefore, we have $a_{n-1}$ options for this case. For the second case, we use the complement method. We can take all valid words starting with $'b'$ and then get rid of all the options for words with a length of $n-2$ starting with $'c'$ . So we have: $a^{b}_{n}=a_{n-1}-a_{n-2}$ options. For the third case, we use the complement method. We can take all valid words starting with $'a'$ and then get rid of all the options for words with a length of $n-2$ starting with $'b'$ .

10,Finishing up a proof on a counting lemma by Sperner,Finishing up a proof on a counting lemma by Sperner,,"Background While working with set families related with Sperner's theorem I found this lemma which I am to prove: If $\Delta\mathcal F=\{ B\in \binom{[n]}{k-1}:\ B\subseteq A,\ \text{for a set } A\in \mathcal F\}$ denotes the shadow of a set $A\in\mathcal F\subseteq \binom{[n]}{k}$ , then the following inequality holds $$\frac{|\Delta\mathcal F|}{\binom{n}{k-1}}\geq \frac{|\mathcal F|}{\binom{n}{k}}.$$ Equality holds if and only if $\mathcal F$ is empty or $\mathcal F$ is precisely $\binom{[n]}{k}$ . Here $\binom{[n]}{k}$ denotes the set of $k$ -subsets of $[n]$ , the set of the first $n$ positive integers. The reference given for the proof was Sperner's 1928 paper . My Approach I have been able to prove the inequality as follows: For every $B\in\Delta\mathcal F$ , there are $n-(k-1)$ ways to add an element to the set in such a way that we obtain a $k$ -subset of $[n]$ . This means that there can be no more than $n-k+1$ sets inside of $\mathcal F$ in which we can find $B$ as a subset . On the other hand, by virtue of the definition of the shadow of $\mathcal F$ , every set $A\in\mathcal F$ contains exactly $\binom{k}{k-1}=k$ sets of $\Delta\mathcal F$ . Now the number of pairs of sets $(A,B)\in \mathcal F\times \Delta\mathcal F$ such that $B\subseteq A$ is exactly $|\mathcal F|·k$ . But such quantity cannot exceed the amount of sets inside of $\Delta\mathcal F$ times the number of ways in which we can find it as a subset of a set in $\mathcal F$ . This amount is precisely $|\Delta F|·(n-k+1)$ . In conclusion we obtain $$|\mathcal F|·k\leq|\Delta F|·(n-k+1), $$ which is equivalent to the initial inequality $\frac{|\Delta\mathcal F|}{\binom{n}{k-1}}\geq \frac{|\mathcal F|}{\binom{n}{k}}$ . My Problem The final part of the lemma asks us to prove when does equality occur. It can be seen that if $\mathcal F$ is empty or it's the set of $k$ -sets, then the inequality becomes an equality. To prove the other direction is the part giving me some troubles. Proving the other direction is equivalent to proving If $\mathcal F$ is a non-empty set family of $k$ -subsets of $[n]$ , and $\frac{|\Delta\mathcal F|}{\binom{n}{k-1}}= \frac{|\mathcal F|}{\binom{n}{k}}$ , then $\mathcal F$ is precisely the set of $k$ -subsets of $[n]$ . My initial observation was that if the equality holds, then two things occur: The number of pairs $(A,B)$ such that $B\subseteq A$ is exactly $|\Delta F|·(n-k+1)$ . For every $B\in\Delta \mathcal F$ , the $n-k+1$ $k$ -sets that can contain $B$ will appear in $\mathcal F$ . However with this information I am not able to see how can I deduce that $\mathcal F$ is $\binom{[n]}{k}$ , I don't know what am I missing but I feel that it's right under my nose. There's also this hunch that tells me that I could also go along the lines of proving $\Delta \mathcal F$ is $\binom{[n]}{k-1}$ . In such a case deducing that $ \mathcal F$ is $\binom{[n]}{k}$ follows from the hypothesis.

13,Prove that the following congruence involving Lucas sequence is true,Prove that the following congruence involving Lucas sequence is true,,"I am proving a congruence that appears in a paper, it claims that for $t\in\mathbb{Z}$ and prime $p\geq5$ $$p\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} \frac{t^k}{k^2\binom{2k}{k}}\equiv \frac{2-v_p(2-t)-t^p}{2p}-p^2\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} \frac{v_k(2-t)}{k^3} \pmod{p^3}$$ where $v_n(P)$ is the Lucas sequence when $Q=1$ , i.e. $v_n(P)=a^n+b^n$ where $a$ and $b$ are the roots of $x^2-Px+1=0$ . The paper uses the following identity \begin{align*}\begin{split}p\binom{2p}{p}\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} \frac{t^k}{k^2\binom{2k}{k}} &= \frac{v_p(t-2)-t^p}{p}+p\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} \binom{2p}{p-k}\frac{v_k(t-2)}{k^2}+p\binom{2p}{p}H_{p-1}^{(2)}+\frac{1}{p}\binom{2p}{p}\\ &= \frac{v_p(t-2)-t^p}{p}+p\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} \binom{2p}{k}\frac{v_{p-k}(t-2)}{(p-k)^2}+p\binom{2p}{p}H_{p-1}^{(2)}+\frac{1}{p}\binom{2p}{p}\end{split}\end{align*} Now using the fact that $\binom{2p}{p}\equiv 2\pmod{p^3}$ and $p\binom{2p}{k}\equiv \frac{2p^2}{k}(-1)^{k-1} \pmod{p^3}$ for $k=1,\dots,p-1$ . It is then easy to deduce that $$p\binom{2p}{p}\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} \frac{t^k}{k^2\binom{2k}{k}}\equiv 2p\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} \frac{t^k}{k^2\binom{2k}{k}} \pmod{p^3}$$ and \begin{align*}\begin{split}p\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} \binom{2p}{k}\frac{v_{p-k}(t-2)}{(p-k)^2} &\equiv 2p^2\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} \frac{(-1)^{k-1}v_{p-k}(t-2)}{k(p-k)^2} \pmod{p^3}\\ &\equiv 2p^2\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} \frac{(-1)^{p-k-1}v_{k}(t-2)}{(p-k)k^2} \pmod{p^3}\\ &\equiv 2p^2\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} \frac{v_{k}(2-t)}{(p-k)k^2} \pmod{p^3}\\ &\equiv -2p^2\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} \frac{v_k(2-t)}{k^3} \pmod{p^3}\end{split}\end{align*} since we have $v_k(-x)=(-1)^k v_k(x)$ .

Suppose there are $k$ balls ''not placed'' in an urn in Step 1. Throw these $k$ balls into the urns randomly. And move on in this fashion until there is no empty urn. What is the expected number of urns that are empty in each step? Answer. Step 1 is easy. For any urn $u_{j}$ , define $X_{j}$ as $X_{j}=1$ if no ball hits and $X_{j}=0$ , otherwise. Then, expected number of empty urns is just $E(X)$ where $X=X_{1}+X_{2}+...+X_{n}$ . Note that $E(X_{j})=Pr(X_{j}=1)=(\frac{n-1}{n})^n$ . Hence, $E(X)=n(\frac{n-1}{n})^n$ .

21,Guessing colored hats without repetition,Guessing colored hats without repetition,,"This entire question is inspired by Problem $12082$ of the Problems and Solutions section of the American Mathematical Monthly (see the May $2020$ issue for the solution to said problem). First, I recall a simpler, classic problem, slightly rephrased. Then I will state the variant, which is the actual question I want to ask. Classic question: Suppose that $n$ people are in a line (so that each can only see the people in front of them) and each has a hat placed on their head. The hats can be any of $k$ different colors, with equal probability of any color occurring (possibly with repetition). Starting from the back of the line, each person tries to guess the color of the hat on their own head. Certainly, the person at the back of the line can do no better than a random guess. But (assuming everyone strategizes beforehand and works as a team) can the last person in line make their guess in such a way that everyone else in the line will be able to guess their hat color with 100% certainty? Classic answer: Replace the hat colors by elements of $\mathbb Z/k\mathbb Z$ . If the colors of the hats are $C_1,C_2,\dots,C_n$ , where $C_n$ corresponds to the last person in line, then the last person guesses $S=C_1+C_2+\dots+C_{n-1}$ . When we get to person $j$ , they can see $C_1,\dots,C_{j-1}$ and they have heard the guesses $C_{j+1},\dots,C_{n-1},S$ . Therefore, they can recover $$C_j=S-(C_1+\dots+C_{j-1}+C_{j+1}+\dots +C_{n-1}).$$ (This is an example of a $(n-1)$ -ary quasigroup of order $k$ . In fact, the strategies for the classic question are precisely the same thing as $(n-1)$ -ary quasigroups of order $k$ .) Variant question: Suppose that we are in the same setup, but there is now only one hat of each color (if the game is to be possible, we must have $k\geq n$ ). The person at the back of the line should guess one of the $k-n+1$ colors that is not visible to them (since they know that they cannot be wearing any of the colors on the heads of the other people). Again, is it possible for the person in the back to make a guess (which now should be restricted to the $k-n+1$ colors not on another head) that allows everyone else in line to guess the color on their head with 100% certainty? Partial answer: Let us phrase the strategy we are looking for in slightly more abstract terms. For any integer $m>0$ , let $[m]=\{1,2,\dots,m\}$ . Then the hats visible to the last person in line correspond to an injection $f:[n-1]\rightarrow [k]$ . Let $\mathcal I$ be the set of all such injections. Then the desired strategy is a function $S:\mathcal I\rightarrow [k]$ such that: $S(f)\notin \text{Im}(f)$ for any $f\in \mathcal I$ ; if $f_1(i)\neq f_2(i)$ for exactly one $i\in [n-1]$ , then $S(f_1)\neq S(f_2)$ . The first condition says that the color being guessed is not already on someone else's head. The second condition says that each subsequent person can recover the color of their hat with 100% certainty. The ultimate question is now just: ""For which $k$ and $n$ does $S$ exist?"" For $n=2$ , we can identify a function $f:[1]\rightarrow [k]$ with its image, in which case the desired strategy is any bijection $S:[k]\rightarrow [k]$ with no fixed points. For $k\geq 2$ , these certainly exist. For $n=k$ , the only possible strategy is to set $S(f)$ to be the unique element of $[k]\setminus \text{Im}(f)$ . For $n=3$ , a strategy $S:\mathcal I\rightarrow [k]$ almost looks like a binary operation $[k]^2\rightarrow [k]$ , but with the caveat that it is not defined on the diagonal of $[k]^2$ . However, by defining $X^2=X$ for all $X\in [k]$ , this extends to a binary operation, which is actually an idempotent quasigroup. Conversely, any idempotent quasigroup restricts to a valid strategy by ignoring the diagonal of $[k]^2$ . This is the idea of the printed answer for the aforementioned Problem 12082 in the AMM, which then proceeds to construct idempotent Latin squares (which are the same thing as quasigroups) for $k\geq 3$ .

It would also be interesting to come up with strategies for small values of $k-n>0$ .","This entire question is inspired by Problem of the Problems and Solutions section of the American Mathematical Monthly (see the May issue for the solution to said problem). First, I recall a simpler, classic problem, slightly rephrased. Then I will state the variant, which is the actual question I want to ask. Classic question: Suppose that people are in a line (so that each can only see the people in front of them) and each has a hat placed on their head. The hats can be any of different colors, with equal probability of any color occurring (possibly with repetition). Starting from the back of the line, each person tries to guess the color of the hat on their own head. Certainly, the person at the back of the line can do no better than a random guess. But (assuming everyone strategizes beforehand and works as a team) can the last person in line make their guess in such a way that everyone else in the line will be able to guess their hat color with 100% certainty? Classic answer: Replace the hat colors by elements of . If the colors of the hats are , where corresponds to the last person in line, then the last person guesses . When we get to person , they can see and they have heard the guesses . Therefore, they can recover (This is an example of a -ary quasigroup of order . In fact, the strategies for the classic question are precisely the same thing as -ary quasigroups of order .) Variant question: Suppose that we are in the same setup, but there is now only one hat of each color (if the game is to be possible, we must have ). The person at the back of the line should guess one of the colors that is not visible to them (since they know that they cannot be wearing any of the colors on the heads of the other people). Again, is it possible for the person in the back to make a guess (which now should be restricted to the colors not on another head) that allows everyone else in line to guess the color on their head with 100% certainty? Partial answer: Let us phrase the strategy we are looking for in slightly more abstract terms. For any integer , let . Then the hats visible to the last person in line correspond to an injection . Let be the set of all such injections. Then the desired strategy is a function such that: for any ; if for exactly one , then . The first condition says that the color being guessed is not already on someone else's head. The second condition says that each subsequent person can recover the color of their hat with 100% certainty. The ultimate question is now just: ""For which and does exist?"" For , we can identify a function with its image, in which case the desired strategy is any bijection with no fixed points. For , these certainly exist. For , the only possible strategy is to set to be the unique element of . For , a strategy almost looks like a binary operation , but with the caveat that it is not defined on the diagonal of . However, by defining for all , this extends to a binary operation, which is actually an idempotent quasigroup. Conversely, any idempotent quasigroup restricts to a valid strategy by ignoring the diagonal of . This is the idea of the printed answer for the aforementioned Problem 12082 in the AMM, which then proceeds to construct idempotent Latin squares (which are the same thing as quasigroups) for .

22,Expected Matrix Product,Expected Matrix Product,,"This question has arisen from a question about a Markov chain where the transition matrix $T$ is random but structured. The idea being that the transition is composed of two parts, transition $A$ and $B$ which occur in known quantities $n$ and $m$ respectively but unknown order. This means that $T$ is the product of $n$ matrices $A$ and $m$ matrices $B$ in some ordering. For example when $m=1$ and $n=2$ $$T \in \{ABB, BAB, BBA\}$$ The question is, when each permutation $\begin{pmatrix} m+n \\ m\end{pmatrix}$ of these $n+m$ matrices is equally likely what is the expected transition matrix $T$ ? Interestingly this is like considering necklaces with fixed content where the colors are matrices. I say this because in the sense that I'm interested in the behavior of $T$ as it is applied to itself, if this problem could be solved invariant to rotations of the ordering of $A,B$ that would also be helpful. My thinking: My initial hope was that $$E[T] = \left(\frac{n}{n+m}A +\frac{m}{n+m} B\right)^{n+m}$$ But that does not seem to be the case by numerical experiments for small $n,m$ where the expected value can be calculated directed by summing over every permutation. My second hope was to be able to ""factor out"" the matrices $A,B$ in the expected value expression. By letting $D = diag(rep(A,n),rep(B,m))$ the (n+m)*size(A) block-diagonal matrix we can consider constructing one order from some permutation $\Pi_1$ . \begin{align*} T(\Pi_1) &= \prod_i^{n+m} (e_i^T \otimes I) (\Pi_1\otimes I) D (\Pi_1\otimes I)^T (e_i \otimes I)\\ &= \prod_i^{n+m} (e_i^T \Pi_1\otimes I)D (\Pi_1^T e_i \otimes I) \end{align*} each term of this product permutes the diagonal blocks of $D$ is the same way, then $(e_i^T \otimes I) \cdots (e_i \otimes I) $ selects off the $i$ th block. This way each of the $n+m$ blocks of $A,B$ occur in some order determined by $\Pi_1$ . My hope from this formulation was that in this form each $\Pi$ would factor out in the expected value of $T$ : $$E[T] = \frac{1}{(\begin{pmatrix} m+n \\ m\end{pmatrix}} \sum_{\Pi} T(\Pi)$$ by using vectorizations but it doesn't seem to work. Notably for each term in the product of $T(\Pi)$ we have $$vec\left((e_i^T \Pi_1\otimes I)D (\Pi_1^T e_i \otimes I)\right) = (\Pi_1 e_i^T \otimes I)\otimes(e_i^T \Pi_1\otimes I) vec(D) $$ The problem here is that despite the data matrix $D$ factoring out nicely from one term it does not help us simplify the product as far as I can tell.

Let $G$ be the group of all the $2 \times 2$ matrices $\left[ \begin{matrix}  a & b \\ c & d \end{matrix} \right]$ , where $a, b, c, d \in \{ 0, \ldots, p-1 \}$ and $ad - bc \not\equiv 0 \mod p$ , under multiplication modulo $p$ . What is the order of $G$ ? My Attempt: Let us first put $p \colon= 2$ . In this case, $G$ consists of all the matrices $\left[ \begin{matrix}  a & b \\ c & d \end{matrix} \right]$ , where $a, b, c, d \in \{ 0, 1 \}$ and $ad - bc \not\equiv 0 \mod 2$ . Case 1. First, we consider the case where at least one of the entries of the general element $\left[ \begin{matrix}  a & b \\ c & d \end{matrix} \right]$ of $G$ is $0$ ,  more precisely is congruent to $0$ modulo $2$ . In this case, neither of the rows and neither of the columns of $\left[ \begin{matrix}  a & b \\ c & d \end{matrix} \right]$ can be zero modulo $2$ . Accordingly, we have the following four sub-cases: Sub-Case 1.1. If $a = 0$ , then $b$ and $c$ cannot be $0$ , although $d$ can; this gives us two possibilities, namely $\left[ \begin{matrix}  0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{matrix} \right]$ and $\left[ \begin{matrix}  0 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{matrix} \right]$ . Sub-Case 1.2. If $b = 0$ , then $a$ and $d$ cannot be $0$ , although $c$ can; this gives us two possibilities, namely $\left[ \begin{matrix}  1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{matrix} \right]$ and $\left[ \begin{matrix}  1 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 \end{matrix} \right]$ . Sub-Case 1.3. If $c = 0$ , then $a$ and $d$ cannot be $0$ , although $b$ can; this gives us two possibilities, namely $\left[ \begin{matrix}  1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{matrix} \right]$ and $\left[ \begin{matrix}  1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{matrix} \right]$ , but only one of these two is a new possibility, for the other one (i.e. the first) has already occured in Sub-Case 1.2. So we have only one more possibility, namely $\left[ \begin{matrix}  1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{matrix} \right]$ . Sub-Case 1.4. Finally, if $d = 0$ , then $b$ and $c$ cannot be $0$ , although $a$ can; this gives us two possibilities, namely $\left[ \begin{matrix}  0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{matrix} \right]$ and $\left[ \begin{matrix}  1 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{matrix} \right]$ , but only one of these two is a new possibility, for the first matrix has already occured in Sub-Case 1.1 above. So we have one more possibility, namely $\left[ \begin{matrix}  1 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{matrix} \right]$ . Thus in the case where at least one of the entries of $\left[ \begin{matrix}  a & b \\ c & d \end{matrix} \right]$ is $0$ , we have the following six elements of $G$ : $\left[ \begin{matrix}  0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{matrix} \right]$ , $\left[ \begin{matrix}  0 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{matrix} \right]$ , $\left[ \begin{matrix}  1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{matrix} \right]$ , $\left[ \begin{matrix}  1 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 \end{matrix} \right]$ , $\left[ \begin{matrix}  1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{matrix} \right]$ , and $\left[ \begin{matrix}  1 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{matrix} \right]$ . Case 2. Next, we consider the case when none of the entries of $\left[ \begin{matrix}  a & b \\ c & d \end{matrix} \right]$ is $0$ . In this case, we are only left with the matrix $\left[ \begin{matrix}  1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{matrix} \right]$ . However, for this matrix we have $1 \cdot 1 - 1 \cdot 1 = 0$ . So we obtain no new elements of $G$ in this case. Therefore for $p = 2$ , the order of $G$ is $6$ . Am I right? Next, we put $p \colon= 3$ . In this case, $G$ consists of all the matrices $\left[ \begin{matrix}  a & b \\ c & d \end{matrix} \right]$ , where $a, b, c, d \in \{ 0, 1, 2 \}$ and $ad - bc \not\equiv 0 \mod 3$ . Case 1. First, we consider the case where at least one of the entries of the general element $\left[ \begin{matrix}  a & b \\ c & d \end{matrix} \right]$ of $G$ is $0$ ,  more precisely is congruent to $0$ modulo $3$ . In this case, neither of the rows and neither of the columns of $\left[ \begin{matrix}  a & b \\ c & d \end{matrix} \right]$ can be zero modulo $3$ . Accordingly, we have the following four sub-cases: Sub-Case 1.1. If $a = 0$ , then $b$ and $c$ cannot be $0$ , although $d$ can; this gives us $2 \times 2 \times 3 = 12$ possibilities. Sub-Case 1.2. If $d = 0$ , then $b$ and $c$ cannot be $0$ , although $a$ can; however for $a=0$ four possibilities from Sub-Case 1.1 will occur again. Thus we have $2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8$ new possibilities. Sub-Case 1.3. If $b = 0$ , then $a$ and $d$ cannot be $0$ , although $c$ can; this gives us $2 \times 2 \times 3 = 12$ possibilities. Sub-Case 1.4. Finally, if $c = 0$ , then $a$ and $d$ cannot be $0$ , although $b$ can; this gives us $2 \times 2 \times 3 = 12$ possibilities in all, but for $b = 0$ the four possibilities of Sub-Case 1.3 will occur again. Thus we get only $2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8$ new possibilities. Thus in the case where at least one of the entries of $\left[ \begin{matrix}  a & b \\ c & d \end{matrix} \right]$ is $0$ , we have $12 + 8 + 12 + 8 = 40$ possibilities. Case 2. Next, we consider the case when none of the entries of $\left[ \begin{matrix}  a & b \\ c & d \end{matrix} \right]$ is $0$ modulo $3$ . In this case we have $2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 16$ possibilities at most. However, in this case, neither of the two columns of $\left[ \begin{matrix}  a & b \\ c & d \end{matrix} \right]$ can be a multiple modulo $3$ of the other column, and neither of the two rows of this matrix can be a multiple modulo $3$ of the other row. Thus the following eight matrices cannot occur in $G$ : $$ \left[ \begin{matrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{matrix} \right], \left[ \begin{matrix} 1 & 1 \\ 2 & 2 \end{matrix} \right], \left[ \begin{matrix} 1 & 2 \\ 1 & 2 \end{matrix} \right], \left[ \begin{matrix} 1 & 2 \\ 2 & 1 \end{matrix} \right], \left[ \begin{matrix} 2 & 1 \\ 2 & 1 \end{matrix} \right], \left[ \begin{matrix} 2 & 1 \\ 1 & 2 \end{matrix} \right], \left[ \begin{matrix} 2 & 2 \\ 1 & 1 \end{matrix} \right], \left[ \begin{matrix} 2 & 2 \\ 2 & 2 \end{matrix} \right].  $$ We are thus left with only $16 - 8 = 8$ possibilities in the case where none of the entries of $\left[ \begin{matrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{matrix} \right]$ is $0$ modulo $3$ . Therefore for $p=3$ , the order of $G$ is $40 + 8 = 48$ . Am I right? Now we consider a general $p$ . In this case, $G$ consists of all the matrices $\left[ \begin{matrix}  a & b \\ c & d \end{matrix} \right]$ , where $a, b, c, d \in \{ 0, 1, \ldots, p-1 \}$ and $ad - bc \not\equiv 0 \mod p$ . Case 1. First, we consider the case where at least one of the entries of the general element $\left[ \begin{matrix}  a & b \\ c & d \end{matrix} \right]$ of $G$ is $0$ ,  more precisely is congruent to $0$ modulo $p$ . In this case, neither of the rows and neither of the columns of $\left[ \begin{matrix}  a & b \\ c & d \end{matrix} \right]$ can be zero modulo $p$ . Accordingly, we have the following four sub-cases: Sub-Case 1.1. If $a = 0$ , then $b$ and $c$ cannot be $0$ , although $d$ can; this gives us $$ (p-1) (p-1)p = p(p-1)^2 $$ possibilities. Sub-Case 1.2. If $d = 0$ , then $b$ and $c$ cannot be $0$ , although $a$ can, giving us $(p-1)(p-1)p = p(p-1)^2$ possibilities; however for $a=0$ the $(p-1)(p-1) = (p-1)^2$ possibilities from Sub-Case 1.1 will occur again. Thus we only have $$ p(p-1)^2 - (p-1)^2 =  (p-1)^3 $$ new possibilities. Sub-Case 1.3. If $b = 0$ , then $a$ and $d$ cannot be $0$ , although $c$ can; this gives us $$ (p-1)(p-1)p = p(p-1)^2 $$ possibilities. Sub-Case 1.4. Finally, if $c = 0$ , then $a$ and $d$ cannot be $0$ , although $b$ can; this gives us $(p-1)(p-1)p = p(p-1)^2$ possibilities in all, but for $b = 0$ the $(p-1)(p-1) = (p-1)^2$ possibilities of Sub-Case 1.3 will occur again. Thus we get only $p(p-1)^2-(p-1)^2 = (p-1)^3$ new possibilities. Thus in the case where at least one of the entries of $\left[ \begin{matrix}  a & b \\ c & d \end{matrix} \right]$ is $0$ modulo $p$ , we have $$ p(p-1)^2+(p-1)^3+p(p-1)^2+(p-1)^3 = 2(2p-1)(p-1)^2 $$ possibilities. Case 2. Next, we consider the case when none of the entries of $\left[ \begin{matrix}  a & b \\ c & d \end{matrix} \right]$ is $0$ modulo $p$ . Now if $x \in \{ 1, \ldots, p-1 \}$ , then $\mbox{gcd}(x, p) = 1$ and so there are integers $x^\prime$ and $p^\prime$ such that $xx^\prime + pp^\prime = 1$ , by Lemma 1.3.1 in Herstein, and hence $xx^\prime -1 = pp^\prime$ , which implies that $p$ divides $xx^\prime - 1$ , or in other words, we have $$ xx^\prime \equiv 1 \mod p.  \tag{A} $$ Now if we divide $x^\prime$ by $p$ , we get integers $q^\prime$ and $r^\prime$ such that $$x^\prime = pq^\prime + r^\prime, $$ where $r^\prime \in \{ 0, 1, \ldots, p-1 \}$ , from which it follows that $$ x^\prime \equiv r^\prime \mod p, $$ and therefore we obtain $$ xx^\prime \equiv xr^\prime \mod p, \tag{B} $$ by Lemma 1.3.3 in Herstein. Thus from (A) and (B) and by Result 1. in Lemma 1.3.3 in Herstein, we have shown that, for each element $x \in \{ 1, \ldots, p-1 \}$ , there exists an element $y \colon= r^\prime$ in $\{ 1, \ldots, p-1 \}$ such that $$ xy \equiv 1 \mod p, $$ or in other words, $$ xy = 1 \ \mbox{ modulo } p. \tag{1} $$ Let us denote this element $y$ by $x^{-1}$ . Alternatively, since $p$ is a prime, the set $\{ 0, 1, \ldots, p-1 \}$ is a field under the operations of addition and multiplication modulo $p$ , which implies that, for each element $x$ of this set, there exists a unique element $x^{-1}$ in the set, such that $$ xx^{-1} = x^{-1}x = 1 \ \mbox{ modulo $p$}. \tag{1} $$ Now since each of the entries of the general element $\left[ \begin{matrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{matrix} \right]$ of $G$ is to be from the set $\{ 1, \ldots, p-1 \}$ , therefore we have $(p-1)(p-1)(p-1)(p-1) = (p-1)^4$ possibilities at most. However, once we have chosen $a$ , $b$ , and $c$ arbitrarily from the set $\{ 1, \ldots, p-1 \}$ , for which there are $(p-1)^3$ possibilities, we cannot choose $d$ from this set in such a way that $ad = bc$ modulo $p$ . Thus, corresponding to each one of the $(p-1)^3$ possible choices for the ordered triple $(a, b, c)$ , the entry $d$ can only be chosen from the set $$ \{ 1, \ldots, p-1 \} - \{ \ a^{-1}bc \}. \qquad \mbox{ [ Refer to (1) above. ] } $$ Thus there are only $p-2$ choices for $d$ corresponding to each one of the $(p-1)^3$ choices for the ordered triple $(a, b, c)$ . Therefore in the case when none of the entries of $\left[ \begin{matrix}  a & b \\ c & d \end{matrix} \right]$ is $0$ modulo $p$ we have $(p-2)(p-1)^3$ possibilities. Hence the order of $G$ is $$  \begin{align} 2(2p-1)(p-1)^2 + (p-2)(p-1)^3 &= \big[ 2(2p-1) + (p-2)(p-1) \big] (p-1)^2 \\ &= \big[ (4p-2) + (p^2 - 3p + 2) \big] (p-1)^2 \\ &= (p^2 + p)(p-1)^2 \\ &= p(p+1)(p-1)^2.  \end{align} $$ For $p = 2$ , we note that $$ p(p+1)(p-1)^2 = 2(2+1)(2-1)^2= 2(3)(1)^2 = 6,$$ whereas for $p=3$ , we have $$ p(p+1)(p-1)^2 = 3(3+1)(3-1)^2= 3(4)(2)^2 = 48.$$ Both these calculations agree with our earlier results. Is my answer correct for a general prime $p$ ? If so, then is each and every detail of my solution accurate enough too? Is my approach the same as that required by Herstein?

It is a hard problem to wrap your mind around. Everything up untill the $5\times 5$ grid is not hard to solve. For example, there is only one solution for a $2\times2$ grid. No $2\times2$ square within the $3\times3$ square grid has 3 cells colored and if you were to color any of the empty cells there would be at least one $2\times2$ square which has 3 cells colored. I also have solutions for the $5\times 5$ and $6\times6$ grid. The problem is that for 6*6 there were a lot of plausible solutions so  it would take absurd amount of time to get the results by hand. The real problem is that I need to create a proof to why for example a 4*4 grids lowest number of colored cells is 7 and that is the thing I have been struggling with. I also need to understand in what manner should I color the cells to get the results I need so that I can get the results on my own as n gets larger.

63,Factory inspections on a budget,Factory inspections on a budget,,"This one goes out to my dad, an EPA inspector for 35 years, whose stories of challenging protocol inspired this question. A factory inspector is testing the efficiency of $n$ machines. For a factory to pass the inspection, all $n$ machines is required to run at or above a certain fixed standard of efficiency $\alpha \in (0,1)$. Mathematically, we'll encode each machine's efficiency as $X_i\in [0,1]$, and that passing the inspection means that $X_i > \alpha$ for all $i=0,\ldots, n$. An inspection is conducted through a sequence of tests. In each test, the inspector chooses a subset $\sigma\subset \{1,\ldots, n\}$ of the machines to be running, and measures their average efficiency $\frac{1}{|\sigma|}\sum_{i\in\sigma}X_i$. Each test costs the factory the same amount of money regardless of how many machines are running. Thus, it is in the factory's interest to reduce the number of tests to a minimum. Let's discuss some strategies for conducting the inspection. The most obvious strategy to conduct the inspection is to measure the machines one at a time (i.e. choosing consecutive singleton sets $\{i\}$, thus measuring the value $X_i$). Doing so requires $n$ tests to prove that all machines are in compliance. On the other hand, if one of the machines is not in compliance, the inspection has failed, and the inspector can stop testing. In some cases, testing multiple machines at once could allow the inspector to complete the inspection in fewer than $n$ tests. For example, measuring an average efficiency of $1$ while running all machines at once would reveal that all machines were individually running at efficiency $1$, thus completing the inspection in a single test. Similarly, measuring a total average efficiency below $\alpha$ would mean at least one machine's efficiency must be below $\alpha$, so the inspection would fail and terminate after only one test. Therefore, it may be advantageous to construct a strategy around multiple-machine tests, as they allow for the possibility of early termination. My questions are, In the general case, is there a strategy to conduct the inspection in fewer than $n$ tests that guarantees a correct answer? I suspect that the answer to the above is no. In particular, I think that there may be strategies other than one-by-one that guarantee a correct answer in $n$ tests, but none that will guarantee an answer in fewer than $n$ tests. The more general question, therefore, is... Suppose that the machine efficiencies $X_i$ are i.i.d. random variables distributed uniformly. What inspection strategy minimizes the expected number of tests required to guarantee a correct answer?","This one goes out to my dad, an EPA inspector for 35 years, whose stories of challenging protocol inspired this question. A factory inspector is testing the efficiency of $n$ machines. For a factory to pass the inspection, all $n$ machines is required to run at or above a certain fixed standard of efficiency $\alpha \in (0,1)$. Mathematically, we'll encode each machine's efficiency as $X_i\in [0,1]$, and that passing the inspection means that $X_i > \alpha$ for all $i=0,\ldots, n$. An inspection is conducted through a sequence of tests. In each test, the inspector chooses a subset $\sigma\subset \{1,\ldots, n\}$ of the machines to be running, and measures their average efficiency $\frac{1}{|\sigma|}\sum_{i\in\sigma}X_i$. Each test costs the factory the same amount of money regardless of how many machines are running. Thus, it is in the factory's interest to reduce the number of tests to a minimum. Let's discuss some strategies for conducting the inspection. The most obvious strategy to conduct the inspection is to measure the machines one at a time (i.e. choosing consecutive singleton sets $\{i\}$, thus measuring the value $X_i$). Doing so requires $n$ tests to prove that all machines are in compliance. On the other hand, if one of the machines is not in compliance, the inspection has failed, and the inspector can stop testing. In some cases, testing multiple machines at once could allow the inspector to complete the inspection in fewer than $n$ tests. For example, measuring an average efficiency of $1$ while running all machines at once would reveal that all machines were individually running at efficiency $1$, thus completing the inspection in a single test. Similarly, measuring a total average efficiency below $\alpha$ would mean at least one machine's efficiency must be below $\alpha$, so the inspection would fail and terminate after only one test. Therefore, it may be advantageous to construct a strategy around multiple-machine tests, as they allow for the possibility of early termination. My questions are, In the general case, is there a strategy to conduct the inspection in fewer than $n$ tests that guarantees a correct answer? I suspect that the answer to the above is no.

However, $k=4$ has a smaller solution at $n=16$, $$[1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 16]^4 = [5, 6, 7, 13, 14, 15]^4$$ and $k=5$ also has one at $n=24$, $$[1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20, 21, 23]^5 = [3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 16,17, 18, 22, 24]^5$$ Presumably for $k=6$, it should be $28\leq n<<39$, but my Mathematica code is too slow for $n>28$. (The Wikipedia link above gives a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm , maybe some interested soul might be interested to implement it.) It seems there might be several families then, and it would be nice to find a unifying principle like in the first family.",,"['combinatorics', 'number-theory', 'diophantine-equations', 'integer-partitions']"
