4,covering a space with closures of disjoint sets from a basis,covering a space with closures of disjoint sets from a basis,,"We are given a compact metric topological space $X$ and a base $\beta$ of its topology. Is it always possible to find a subset of the basis, say $\beta_0 \subset \beta$, such that each point of the space is contained in a closure of a set from $\beta_0$, i.e. $\bigcup_{U \in \beta_0} \overline{U} = X$, and the sets from $\beta_0$ are pairwise disjoint, i.e. $\forall U,V \in \beta_0 : \ U = V \vee U \cap V = \emptyset$. My guess is that it is impossible in general, because of two arguments. Firstly, there exist dense open subsets of $[0,1]$ with arbitralily small measure, so we need to be careful choosing sets for $\beta_0$ (making it any maximal subset of $\beta$ with pairwise disjoint will not suffice). Secondly, it would just be too good to be true, and a proof of a certain measure-theoretical problem would become too simple.","We are given a compact metric topological space $X$ and a base $\beta$ of its topology.

14,Prove that a simplex is a manifold with corners,Prove that a simplex is a manifold with corners,,"First of all  we remember some elementary definitions and results about manifolds and simplexes. Definition A function $f$ defined in a subset $S$ of $\Bbb R^k$ is said of class $C^r$ if it can be extended to a function $\phi$ (said $C^r$ -extension) that is of class $C^r$ in a open neighborhood of $S$ . Lemma If $f$ is a function defined in a subset $S$ of $\Bbb R^n$ such that for any $x\in S$ there exists a function $f_x$ defined in a neighborhood of $x$ that is of class $C^r$ and compatible with $f$ on $U_x\cap S$ then $f$ is of class $C^r$ . Lemma If $U$ is an open set of $H_n:=[0,+\infty)^n$ then the derivatives of two different extensions $\phi$ and $\varphi$ of a $C^r$ -function $f$ agree in $U$ . Definition A $k$ -manifold with corners in $\Bbb R^n$ of class $C^r$ is a subspace $M$ of $\Bbb R^n$ whose points have a neighborhood $V$ in $M$ that is the immage of a homeomorphism $\phi$ of calss $C^r$ defined an open set $U$ of $\Bbb R^k$ or of $H_k$ and whose derivative has rank $k$ . Definition If $x_0,...,x_k$ are $(k+1)$ affinely indipendent points of $\Bbb R^n$ (which means that the vectors $(x_1-x_0),...,(x_k-x_0)$ are linearly independent) then simplex determined by them is the set $$ \mathcal S:=\Biggl\{x\in\Bbb R^n: x=x_0+\alpha^i\vec v_i\,\,\,\text{and}\,\,\, \sum_{i=1}^k\alpha^i\le1\,\,\,\text{and}\,\,\,\alpha^i\ge0\,\,\,\text{for all}\,i=1,\dots,k\Biggl\} $$ where $\vec v_i:=(x_i-x_0)$ for each $i=1,\dots,k$ . With the previous definition we let try to prove that any simplex is a $k$ -manifold with corners. First of all we define the function $f$ from $\Bbb R^k$ to $\Bbb R^n$ by putting $$ f(x):=x_0+x^1\vec v_1+\dots+x^k\vec v_k $$ for each $x\in\Bbb R^k$ and thus we observe that it is a smooth homeomorphism because it is the composition of a translation with a linear and injective map betweeen finite dimensional topological vector spaces -for details about this statement we refer to to the text Functional Analysis of Walter Rudin. So if we show that $f^{-1}[S]$ is a manifold with corners then the statement follows immediately.

Now we find a coordinate patch about any point $x$ of $\mathcal E_k$ and we are doing this assuming that it is $$ x^1+\dots+x^k\lneq 1\,\,\,\,\,\,\text{or either}\,\,\,x^1+\dots+x^k=1 $$ Now the function scalar $g$ defined in $\Bbb R^k$ through the equation $$ g(x):=x^1+\dots+x^k $$ for any $x\in\Bbb R^k$ is trivially continuous (indeed it is a liner map between finite dimensional topological vector spaces or alternatively is finite sum of continuous functions) so that the set $g^{-1}\big[(0,1)\big]$ is open and thus observing that $$ g^{-1}\big[(0,1)\big]\cap\mathcal E_k=\big\{x\in\Bbb R^k:0\lneq x^1+\dots+x^k\lneq 1\big\}\cap\big\{x\in\Bbb R^k:x^1+\dots+x^k\le 1\,\,\,\text{and}\,\,\,x^i\ge0\,\,\,\text{for all}\,\,\,i=1,\dots,k\big\}=\\ \big\{x\in\Bbb R^k:0\lneq x^1+\dots+x^k\lneq 1\big\}\cap\big\{x\in\Bbb R^k:x^i\ge0\,\,\,\text{for all}\,\,\,i=1,\dots,k\big\}=g^{-1}\big[(0,1)\big]\cap H^k_k $$ we conclude that the restriction of the identity map to the set $g^{-1}\big[(0,1)\big]\cap H^k_k$ is a coordinate patch about $x$ in an open set of the not negative space $H^k_k$ when in the first case it is $$ x^1+\dots+x^k\neq 0 $$ too. Otherwise $\mathcal E_k$ is contained into the not negative space $H^k_k$ so that if $x\in\mathcal E_k$ is such that $$ x^1+\dots+x^k=0 $$ then $x$ is just the origin $O$ and thus if we find an open cube centered at $O$ whose intersection with $H^k_k$ is contained in $\mathcal E_k$ then the restriction of the identity map to the intersection between $H^k_k$ and this open cube is a coordinate patch about $O$ defined in an open set of $H^k_k$ .

I want to ask, whether this fact generalizes to orbit spaces of groupoids. More precisely: Let $G$ be a topological groupoid. I will denote objects by $G_0$ , morphisms by $G_1$ , the source map by $s$ and the target map by $t$ . There is an equivalence relation $\sim$ on $G_0$ : $$x\sim y \text{ iff. there exists a morphism } g \in G_1 \text{ such that } s(g) = x \text{ and } t(g) = y.$$ It is easy to check that this is an equivalence relation. The class corresponding to $x$ will be called its orbit. Note that, the orbit of $x$ contains all those points in $G_0$ which are targets of morphisms originating at $x$ , or in other words, the orbit of $x$ is the set $t(s^{-1}(x))$ . Then, $G_0/\sim$ equipped with the quotient topology is called the orbit space of the groupoid $G$ . My question is: is the quotient map $G_0 \to G_0/\sim$ open? Remark . We can recover the original statement about quotient by a group, by considering the translation gropoid $G \ltimes X$ (since its orbit space is precisely $X/G$ ). I haven't made any progress in the general case. EDIT: I was making things unnecessarily complicated. At least, for the étale case, the proof is laughably trivial; its just a point-set argument similar to what we do in the group case. First of note that if $p : X \to X/\sim$ is a quotient map and $A\subset X$ , then $p^{-1}(p(A))$ is the set of all the elements of $X$ which are related by $\sim $ to some element in $A$ . Now, let $G$ be an étale topological groupoid with orbit space $G_0/\sim$ and quotient map $q : G_0 \to G_0/\sim$ . Suppose $U$ is an open subset of $G_0$ . We need to show that $q(U)$ is open. It suffices to show that $q^{-1}(q(U))$ is open because $q$ is a quotient map. By the preceding observation, $q^{-1}(q(U))$ is the set of those elements $G_0$ which are in the orbit of some element $U$ , or in other words, it is the set of all points in $G_0$ which are targets of morphisms originating in $U$ .

Basically, this just means that every non-identity element moves every element in $S^\infty$ . My attempt: So $D_4$ is generated by $r$ and $s$ where $r^2=s^4=(rs)^2=e$ .

31,Spivak Calculus on Manifolds - Tangent space on a boundary point of a manifold,Spivak Calculus on Manifolds - Tangent space on a boundary point of a manifold,,"I am an undergraduate student who is studying Spivak's calculus on manifolds. I have several questions in the pages 119 and 120 of the book, which are about the tangent space at a boundary point of a manifold. Our definitions of vector fields, forms, and orientations can be made for manifolds-with-boundary also. If $M$ is a $k$ -dimensional manifold-with-boundary and $x\in\partial M$ , then $(\partial M)_x$ is a $(k-1)$ -dimensional subspace of the $k$ -dimensional vector space $M_x$ . Thus there are exactly two unit vectors in $M_x$ which are perpendicular to $(\partial M)_x$ ; they can be distinguished as follows (Figure $5-8$ ). If $f:W\to\mathbf{R}^{n}$ is a coordinate system with $W\subset H^{k}$ and $f(0)=x$ , then only one of these unit vectors is $f_*(v_0)$ for some $v_0$ with $v^{k}<0$ . This unit vector is called the outward unit normal $n(x)$ ; it is not hard to check that this definition does not depend on the coordinate system $f$ . Suppose that $\mu$ is an orientation of a $k$ -dimensional manifold-with-boundary $M$ . If $x\in\partial M$ , choose $v_1,\ldots,v_{k-1}\in(\partial M)_x$ so that $[n(x),v_1,\ldots,v_{k-1}]=\mu _x$ . If it is also true that $[n(x),w_1,\ldots,w_{k-1}]=\mu _x$ , then both $[v_1,\ldots,v_{k-1}]$ and $[w_1,\ldots,w_{k-1}]$ are the same orientation for $(\partial M)_x$ . This orientation is denoted by $(\partial\mu)_x$ . It is easy to see that the orientations $(\partial\mu)_x$ ,for $x\in\partial M$ , are consistent on $\partial M$ . Thus if $M$ is orientable, $\partial M$ is also orientable, and an orientation $\mu$ for $M$ determines an orientation $\partial\mu$ for $\partial M$ , called the induced orientation . If we apply these definitions to $\mathbf{H}^{k}$ with the usual orientation, we find that the induced orientation on $\mathbf{R}^{k-1}=\left\{x\in\mathbf{H}^{k}:x^{k}=0\right\} $ is $(-1)^{k}$ times the usual orientation. The reason for such a choice will become clear in the next section. I think I understand why there are exactly two unit vectors in $M_x$ which are perpendicular to $(\partial M)_x$ . This is because the dimension of the subspace of $M_x$ that is orthogonal to $(\partial M)_x$ is 1, and in a one dimensional space, there are two unit vectors which have the same size but the different directions (Is this correct?). And Spivak says in the picture that ""..., then only one of these unit vectors is $f_*(v_0)$ for some $v_0$ with $v^k < 0$ . Is it right that ""these unit vectors"" mean the two unit vectors perpendicular to $(\partial M)_x$ and that it is 'only one' because it cannot have two different directions at the same time? Spivak says it is easy to see that given an orientation of a k dimensional manifold with boundary $M$ , the orientations $(\partial \mu)_x$ for $x \in \partial M$ are consistent on $(\partial M)_x$ . My reasoning is that following the Spivak's definition of consistent choices of orientations, consider a chart $f: W \subset H^k \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ and $a, b \in W$ ( $a$ is an interior point and $b$ is an interior point). Because by assumption $M$ is orientable, if $\mu_{f(a)} = [f_*((e_1)a), . . . , f_*((e_k)a)]$ , then $\mu_{f(b)} = [f_*((e_1)b), . . . , f_*((e_{k - 1})b), n(b)]$ where $n(b)$ is an outward unit normal. Then, we can choose $[f_*((e_1)b), . . . , f_*((e_{k - 1})b)]$ as $(\partial \mu)_b$ . In this way, by restricting $f$ to the intersection of its image and $\partial M$ , we can get the same orientation for all $x \in \partial M$ ; thus, if $M$ is orientable, so is $\partial M$ . Please check if my reasoning is okay. At the bottom of the picture, Spivak says the induced orientation on ... is $(-1)^k$ times the usual orientation. I really cannot understand how this happens. In the next page, he says that the vectors $n(x)$ vary continuously on $M$ . Also, conversely, if a continuous family of unit normal vectors $n(x)$ is defined on all of $M$ , we can determine an orientation of $M$ . Could you explain why this is the case?

But if you take the limit as $n$ approaches infinity, then the point converges to $(0,1,1)$, which is not in the set. So it is not closed.

Proof idea: Here's my original intuition for what could work, but I'm not confident all arguments are sound. Let $h$ correspond to some probability measure over $\mathbb{R}$ that has full support (by which I mean, if $h(A)=0$, then the set $A$ has Lebesgue measure zero - should I rather call this absolutely continuous?) and admits a distribution function $H$. Then let  $$g(x)=H^{-1}(1-h(f^{-1}((f(x),\infty)))-h(f^{-1}(\{f(x)\})\cap(x,\infty)).$$ Furthermore, let $$A=\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty\left\{\left(\frac{m}{n},\frac{m+1}{n}\right)\mid 0\leq m<n\text{ and }h\left(f^{-1}\left(\frac{m}{n},\frac{m+1}{n}\right)\right)=0\right\}.$$ Since $f^{-1}(A)$ can be written as a countable union of inverse images with zero measure each, it follows that $h(f^{-1}(A))=0$. In that case, $f(x)<f(y)$ with $x,y\notin f^{-1}(A)$ implies $(f(x),\infty)\supseteq(f(y),\infty)\cup (\{f(y)\}\cap(x,\infty))\cup (f(x),f(y))$ and the inverse image of the last part of this disjoint union has nonzero measure by definition of $A$. This implies $g(x)<g(y)$, establishing the desired order condition. As for bijectivity, let $z\in \mathbb{R}$. I want to show $h(g^{-1}(z))=0$. By the above, all points in $g^{-1}(z)\setminus A$ share a common function value $f(z)$. Let $(a,b)$ be the infimum and the maximum of $g^{-1}(z)$ respectively. By the definition of $g(\cdot)$, it must hold that $h(g^{-1}(z))\leq h(f^{-1}({f(z)})\cap(a,b))=0$. This establishes my notion of ""almost everywhere injective"". Lastly, for surjectivity, let $k=H^{-1}(y)$ for any $y\in\mathbb{R}$. Set $z=\inf\{f(x)\mid h(f^{-1}((f(x),\infty)))<k\}$. Either $h(f^{-1}((z,\infty)))=k$ and $h(f^{-1}(\{z\}))=0$, or $h(f^{-1}((z,\infty)))>k$. Either way, there exists $x\in f^{-1}(\{z\})$ such that $g(x)=H^{-1}(k)$. Does this sound plausible?

Then let  $$g(x)=H^{-1}(1-h(f^{-1}((f(x),\infty)))-h(f^{-1}(\{f(x)\})\cap(x,\infty)).$$ Furthermore, let $$A=\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty\left\{\left(\frac{m}{n},\frac{m+1}{n}\right)\mid 0\leq m<n\text{ and }h\left(f^{-1}\left(\frac{m}{n},\frac{m+1}{n}\right)\right)=0\right\}.$$ Since $f^{-1}(A)$ can be written as a countable union of inverse images with zero measure each, it follows that $h(f^{-1}(A))=0$. In that case, $f(x)<f(y)$ with $x,y\notin f^{-1}(A)$ implies $(f(x),\infty)\supseteq(f(y),\infty)\cup (\{f(y)\}\cap(x,\infty))\cup (f(x),f(y))$ and the inverse image of the last part of this disjoint union has nonzero measure by definition of $A$. This implies $g(x)<g(y)$, establishing the desired order condition. As for bijectivity, let $z\in \mathbb{R}$. I want to show $h(g^{-1}(z))=0$. By the above, all points in $g^{-1}(z)\setminus A$ share a common function value $f(z)$. Let $(a,b)$ be the infimum and the maximum of $g^{-1}(z)$ respectively. By the definition of $g(\cdot)$, it must hold that $h(g^{-1}(z))\leq h(f^{-1}({f(z)})\cap(a,b))=0$. This establishes my notion of ""almost everywhere injective"". Lastly, for surjectivity, let $k=H^{-1}(y)$ for any $y\in\mathbb{R}$. Set $z=\inf\{f(x)\mid h(f^{-1}((f(x),\infty)))<k\}$. Either $h(f^{-1}((z,\infty)))=k$ and $h(f^{-1}(\{z\}))=0$, or $h(f^{-1}((z,\infty)))>k$. Either way, there exists $x\in f^{-1}(\{z\})$ such that $g(x)=H^{-1}(k)$. Does this sound plausible? Shouldn't there be a much more simple approach to prove this intuitive result?",,"['real-analysis', 'general-topology', 'reference-request', 'proof-verification', 'lebesgue-measure']"

Now assuming that $\mathcal{T}$ is $T_0$ topology, prove directly that it is $T_3$ (regular), and then prove that it is $T_{3\frac{1}{2}}$ (completely regular). Can somebody help me with proving this?? I can't even start... Also, if anybody have any reference related to this problem, let me know then I will appreciate it. Thank you in advance... New things On the other hand, I tried to disprove the above problem by giving a counter-example... If any one interested in the following claim, you may check and verify. Furthermore, if you can find any mistake or wrongness on the claim, and if you let me know, I will appreciate so much... Thank you. Now, I thought the following example was a counter example, but I got $0$ score on this.. (It was a homework whether to prove or disprove (by giving a counter example).) Let $X=\mathbb{R}$ with $\mathcal{F}_0=\{f,g\}$ where $f$ is defined by $f(x)=x$ for $x\geq 0$, and $f(x)=-\frac{1}{2}x$ for $x<0$, and $g(x)=-\frac{1}{2}x$ for $x\geq 0$ and $g(x)=x$ for $x<0$. Then, by drawing a graph, you can easily see that the smallest topology generated by this functions is $T_0$ space (You can choose arbitrary small open interval on $Y$-axis to separte a point (in $X$) from another point (in $X$)). Now consider a point $-\frac{1}{2}$ and a closed subset $[0,1]$. Since for every $(a,b)\subset\mathbb{R}$ such that $\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{4}\in(a,b)$, either $f^{-1}(a,b)$ or $g^{-1}(a,b)$ intersects $[0,1]$ while the $f^{-1}(a,b)$ or $g^{-1}(a,b)$ are basic open sets in $\mathcal{T}_0$, that containing $-\frac{1}{2}\in\mathbb{R}$, I claim that it is not regular, and hence not completely regular.","Fix a set $X$.
