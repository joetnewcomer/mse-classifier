Pete [edited here - lucky I do LateX] The volume of a conical frustum bucket is given by $$V=\frac{\pi h}{3}(R^2+Rr+r^2)$$ given $r=15$ cm, $R=22$ cm & $h=56$ cm what is the rate of change of the height of water in the bucket after one minute if it is being filled at a constant rate $\frac{dV}{dt}=0.3$ L/s, from empty. Eliminating $R$ from the equation above using similar triangles and letting $R=15+\frac{h}{8}$ we get $$V=225\pi h + \tfrac{15\pi h^2}{8}+\tfrac{\,\pi h^3}{192}$$ $$\Rightarrow \tfrac{dV}{dt}=(225\pi+\tfrac{15\pi h}{4}+\tfrac{\pi h^2}{64})\tfrac{dh}{dt}$$ After 1 minute $V=18$ litres $=18000$ cm$^3 \Rightarrow h\approx 21.4$ cm. Solving for $\frac{dh}{dt}$ gives $$\tfrac{dh}{dt} =\frac{0.3}{225\pi+\tfrac{15\pi h}{4}+\tfrac{\pi h^2}{64}}$$  and hence $\frac{dh}{dt}\approx0.0031$cm/s This is what seems a bit 'low' to me - I am looking at the horse bucket in my mind as I fill it ans it goes faster than that - doesn't it?","I have an embarrassing question to ask. Embarrassing in the sense that I should be able to confirm or refute the solutions I got but I just can't seem to rationalise the results I worked out. I am working on a tutorial for some of my students and I want to know if I have the Mathematics right because the numbers I end up with seem a bit small. And before people start telling me, I know there are better ways to do this problem but it is more about showing the students how similar triangles can be used in these related rates type problems that they will get in their exam. Don't shoot the messenger - I don't write the curriculum. The problem is set out in this PowerPoint (or see below because apparently PPT is the tool of the devil) as a number of tutors will deliver this to the different classes. I greatly appreciate any help I may get.
