Too bad, the last term can not be combined again in the form of a binomial expansion. Approach #2: Instead of expanding the error function, I tried writing it in terms of the cumulative CDF function (Q-Function) as $\text{erf}(x) = 2\Phi(\sqrt{2} x) - 1$. However, the following can be shown to be true using integration under the integral sign with respect to $\mu$. [Section 2.4 , and ref] $$ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi} \sigma}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\Phi(\lambda x) \text{e}^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2 \sigma^2}}dx =\Phi\left(\frac{\lambda \mu}{\sqrt{1+\lambda^2\sigma^2}}\right) $$ Now with some change of variables and rescaling we are instead interested in the following integral: $$ \int\text{e}^{a_1 x^2 + a_2 x} \text{erf}\left(x\right) dx = \underbrace{2\int \text{e}^{a_1 x^2 + a_2 x} \Phi(\sqrt{2} x) dx}_{I} - \underbrace{\int \text{e}^{a_1 x^2 + a_2 x} dx}_{easy} $$ However, what I'm not certain of if I can use the trick of integration under integral sign for the indefinite integral labeled I. Can I, with some change of variables, use the result deduced for the definite integral case as $\Phi\left(\frac{\lambda \mu}{\sqrt{1+\lambda^2\sigma^2}}\right) + C(x)$?

Also, user90369 has pointed out that the following more general case have no closed form solution.   $$ \int x^{2n} \text{e}^{-ax^2} \text{erf}(bx+c) dx $$   I was wondering, if there are any good approximations that I can use here. By good, I mean refer to an error that is $|e(x)| \leq 10^{-5} \forall x$.   For starter, I was looking at the high accuracy approximations in here for the erf function. Unfortunately, none of these approximations result into an integral that inherits a closed form solution. I, however, have the following suggested approach with the use of the following identity.   $$ \text{erf}(bx+c) = 2 \Phi\left(\sqrt{2} (bx+c)\right) - 1 $$   This results into the following:   $$ \begin{aligned} \int\text{e}^{-ax^2 } \text{erf}\left(bx + c\right) dx = 2\int \text{e}^{-ax^2 } \Phi\left(\sqrt{2} (bx+c)\right) dx - \int \text{e}^{-ax^2 } dx \end{aligned} $$   Now, one can use the approximation of the $\Phi$-function that results from applying Chernof's bound. Link $$ \Phi(x) \approx \frac{1}{12} \text{e}^{-\frac{x^2}{2}} + \frac{1}{4} \text{e}^{-\frac{2}{3} x^2} $$   I'd like to take a suggestion of how good is this approximation after computing the integral.

4,Help an geographer define an equation!,Help an geographer define an equation!,,"I'm a physical geographer and I'm working on a piece of research where I have some broad physical relationships which I want to try and put into an equation - i.e. I want to define an empirical equation which describes the phenomena I've observed. I'm way out of my depth in formulating equations so I'm hoping someone here can help. I have a suspicion this is not a hugely complex problem for anyone who knows maths! It's probably not relevant to the question, but it's all about how the physical properties of peat bogs alter how their water content changes over time, and then how that water content, coupled with their density, affects wildfire risk. For a given point in time, and a given location I'll have a volumetric water content $V_x$. (So I I'll have a lots of these values for different times and locations) For each location I'll have a normally distributed bulk density $pb$, for which I know the mean and standard deviation. If the volumetric water content is multiplied by bulk density it gives gravimetic water content $U_x$. (So for any given $V_x$ and I'd have a bunch of values for $U_x$, which I think would be a probability distribution?) Gravimetric water content determines wildfire susceptibility (drier is more susceptible). It makes sense to define 2 thresholds: $U^*$, below which burning is almost certain, and $U_w$ above which burning is unlikely. I'd like to define this as probability of burning with 1 (or near 1) at $U^*$ and a probability of $~0.1$ to $0.2$ at $U_w$. Between these values the relationship would not be linear but would be a curve which drops off with increasing U. Ideally (as we're still trying to get a handle on this) there would be an adjustable factor for exactly how quickly this drops off with increasing $U$ approaching $U_w$. So what I'd like to do is take a probability distribution of $U$ (based on the $V_x$ and the distribution of pb values). And then multiple this by the probability of burning relationship so I can say; given a volumetric water content, and given the bulk density distribution, $K$ is the probability of wildfire burning. As I said, I'm just not good enough with maths to put all these things together into an equation! The ultimate idea is to propose this empirical equation which then I and other researcher can test.

The exercise states the following: A high-tech company purchases a new computing system whose initial value is $V$ .  The system will depreciate at the rate $f=f(t)$ and will accumulate maintenance costs at the rate of $g=g(t)$ , where $t$ is the time measured in months.

In other words, the depreciation rate $f(t)$ is factored into the solution BUT the maintenance rate $g(t)$ is not (i.e. I can ignore the maintenance rate).  Is this correct?  If this is not correct then can you please explain why? Again, we are asked to determine the total depreciation time.  The formula for $f(t)$ shows the time interval of depreciation is $(0,30]$ .  I understand this to mean the computer system has fully depreciated when $t=30$ . So the total depreciation $D(t)=V$ is when $t=30$ . Is this correct? If so then this seems to me to the answer to part $b$ .

Find maximum eccentricity.,A person's quickest path between any two points on perimeter of elliptical lake never involves both swimming and running. Find maximum eccentricity.,,"I made up this question. A police officer's job is to patrol the perimeter of an elliptical lake. They have a constant (unknown) swimming speed and a constant (unknown) running speed. Their quickest path between any two points on the perimeter never involves both swimming and running. What is the maximum value of $e$ , the eccentricity of the ellipse? Proof that $e$ has an upper bound If $e\approx 1$ then the lake looks almost like a straight river. Consider a point on one side, and another point on the other side further ""downstream"". Clearly, the quickest path between the points could involve swimming and running. We can prove that if $e=0$ (circle) then the quickest path never involves swimming and running. Suppose $e=0$ and the quickest path between two points involves swimming and running, i.e. the path includes a chord and arc that share an endpoint. Let $\alpha=$ angle subtended by the chord ( $0<\alpha<\pi$ ), and $\theta=$ angle subtended by the chord-arc pair. Assuming the radius of the circle is $1$ , the time for this path is $T=\dfrac{2\sin (\alpha/2)}{v_{\text{swim}}}+\dfrac{\theta-\alpha}{v_{\text{run}}}$ $\dfrac{d^2 T}{d\alpha^2}=-\dfrac{\sin (\alpha/2)}{2v_{\text{swim}}}<0$ So the minimum value of $T$ occurs at one of the endpoints, i.e. $\alpha=0$ or $\alpha=\theta$ , which implies that the path involves either only running or only swimming, contradiction. Therefore if $e=0$ then the quickest path never involves swimming and running. So $e$ must have an upper bound.","I made up this question.

First of all, Wolfram Does Not give a Closed Form for the Function. But it does give the function value for values of $x$ as follows: $$f(-2)=\frac{\text{Ei}(4)-\gamma-\ln4}{4}$$ $$f(-1)=e-1$$ $$f(0)=1$$ $$f(1)=2e$$ $$f(2)=29e^4$$ $$f(3)=1279e^9$$ $$f(4)=113137e^{16}$$ Now, for $f(n)$ , $n\in \mathrm N$ : $$f(n)=a_ne^{n^2}$$ The Sequence "" $2, 29, 1279, 113137$ "" led to no results on OEIS. EDIT: Using Binomial Expansion: $$f(x)=\sum_{r=0}^{x}\frac{x!}{\left(x-r\right)!r!}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^{2n}n^{r}}{n!}$$ Now you could say the Problem Comes Down to Expanding $\frac{n^r}{n!}$ : Example: $$\frac{n^4}{n!}=\frac{1}{\left(n-4\right)!}+\frac{6}{\left(n-3\right)!}+\frac{7}{\left(n-2\right)!}+\frac{1}{\left(n-1\right)!}$$ But then, although I can do this by hand, how do I write it as a function of $r$ . Second Edit: Using @SangchulLee's help, I was able to deduce this form for natural numbers: $$f(n)=\left(\sum_{r=0}^{n}\binom{n}{r}\text{T}_r\left(n^2\right)\right)e^{n^{2}}$$ where, $\text{T}_r(x)$ are Touchard Polynomials . Then after browsing through I found a wonderful property: $$\frac{T_{n+1}\left(x\right)}{x}=\sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{n}{k}T_{k}\left(x\right)$$ This leads to the closed form in terms of Touchard Polynomial: $$f(n)=\frac{\text{T}_{n+1}\left(n^2\right)}{n^{2}}e^{n^2}$$ $$\color{green}{f(x)=\frac{\left(x+1\right)!}{\pi x^{2}}\int_{0}^{\pi}\left(e^{x^{2}\left(e^{\cos\left(t\right)}\cos\left(\sin\left(t\right)\right)\right)}\cos\left(x^{2}e^{\cos\left(t\right)}\sin\left(\sin t\right)-\left(x+1\right)t\right)\right)dt}$$ Well this seems to be the closed form.

Find the value of $\int_{0}^{1} (x-f(x))^{2016} dx$ . This is a very popular problem(maybe). I used two attempts to solve the problem. It appears my Attempt $1$ didn't quite work, as I intended. My Attempt $2$ surprisingly worked. I will demonstrate both the attempts. Attempt 1: We first consider,if $f(x)=y$ then, $f(f(x))=x=f(y).$ We consider, the integral $I=\int (x-f(x))^{2016} dx$ . We try changing, all the independent variable of integration, from $x$ to $y$ ( or, in other words we are trying to apply method of substitution i.e substituting, $y=f(x)$ in $I$ ). For that, we have to replace $dx$ as well. We notice that, $$f(y)=x\implies \frac{df(y)}{dy}\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{d}{dx}x\implies f'(y)\frac{dy}{dx}=1\implies f'(y)dy=dx.$$ We are now in a place to completely do the change of variables in $I$ . We have, $$I=\int (x-f(x))^{2016} dx=\int (f(y)-y)^{2016}f'(y)dy$$ . We can again, change the variable representation in $I$ to $x$ as, $$I=\int(f(x)-x)^{2016}f'(x)dx\tag {1}.$$ Now, we again observe $\int (x-f(x))^{2016} dx$ and adding it with $( 1),$ we have $$2I=\int\left( (x-f(x))^{2016} +(f(x)-x)^{2016}f'(x)\right)dx.$$ This can be readily simplified to, $$2I=\int\left( (x-f(x))^{2016}(1 +f'(x))\right)dx.$$ We now, have, $$I=\frac{\int\left( (x-f(x))^{2016}(1 +f'(x)\right)dx}{2}.$$ We hereby, put the upper limit and lower limit as $1$ and $0$ respectively. This means, $$I=\frac{\int_0^1\left( (x-f(x))^{2016}(1 +f'(x)\right)dx}{2}.$$ Here comes a mystery. I was stuck at this particular step. Attempt 2: (In this method, I proceeded to work with $I=\int_0^1(x-f(x))^{2016}dx$ instead of, $I=\int(x-f(x))^{2016}dx$ ) We first consider,if $f(x)=y$ then, $f(f(x))=x=f(y).$ We consider, the integral $I=\int (x-f(x))^{2016} dx$ .

We have, $$I=\int_0^1 (x-f(x))^{2016} dx=\int_1^0 (f(y)-y)^{2016}f'(y)dy$$ . (We have, $y=f(x)$ and $x=0\implies y=f(0)=1$ and $x=1\implies y=f(1)=f(f(0))=0$ and since the variable of integration is $y$ here, so the corresponding upper limit and lower limit in terms $x$ (initially) $(1,0)$ will change to $(0,1)$ due to change in variable to $y$ ) We can again, change the variable representation in $I$ to $x$ as, $$I=\int_1^0(f(x)-x)^{2016}f'(x)dx$$ $$\implies I=-\int_0^1(f(x)-x)^{2016}f'(x)dx \tag 1.$$ Now, we again observe $\int_0^1 (x-f(x))^{2016} dx$ and adding it with $( 1),$ we have $$2I=\int_0^1\left( (x-f(x))^{2016} -(f(x)-x)^{2016}f'(x)\right)dx.$$ This can be readily simplified to, $$2I=\int_0^1\left( (x-f(x))^{2016}(1 -f'(x))\right)dx.$$ We now, have, $$I=\frac{\int_0^1(x-f(x))^{2016}(1 -f'(x))dx}{2}.$$ We notice, $$I=\frac{\int_0^1 (x-f(x))^{2016}(1 -f'(x))dx}{2},$$ can again be readily simplified by substituting $t=x-f(x)$ and so, $$\frac{dt}{dx}=(1-f'(x))\implies \frac{dt}{(1-f'(x))}=dx.$$ Hence, $$I=\frac{\int_0^1 (x-f(x))^{2016}(1 -f'(x))dx}{2}=$$ $$\begin{align}\frac{\int_{-1}^1 (x-f(x))^{2016}(1 -f'(x))\frac{dt}{(1-f'(x))}}{2}\end{align}$$ $$=\frac 1{2}\int_{-1}^1t^{2016}dt=\frac{1}{2.2017}[t^{2017}]^1_{-1}=\frac{1}{2017}.$$ So, I could solve, the problem in my 2nd Attempt prestty much easily. I analyzed both of the attempt $1$ and $2.$ I found that the problem in Attempt $1$ started because in the last step of Attempt $1$ we hit at the expression $$I=\frac{\int_0^1\left( (x-f(x))^{2016}(1 +f'(x)\right)dx}{2}.$$ In attempt $2$ , inspite of hitting at $$I=\frac{\int_0^1\left( (x-f(x))^{2016}(1 +f'(x)\right)dx}{2},$$ we hit at $$I=\frac{\int_0^1(x-f(x))^{2016}(1 -f'(x))dx}{2}.$$ This expression $$I=\frac{\int_0^1(x-f(x))^{2016}(1 -f'(x))dx}{2},$$ was easy to manipulate further, because, we had $(1-f'(x))$ here, instead of the ""troublesome"" $(1+f'(x))$ there. But this is strange, why do I get $$I=\frac{\int_0^1(x-f(x))^{2016}(1 -f'(x))dx}{2},$$ in attempt $2$ , instead of $$I=\frac{\int_0^1\left( (x-f(x))^{2016}(1 +f'(x)\right)dx}{2},$$ as in Attempt $1$ ? If one notice, then it might be observed that, there is no difference in the procedure applied in both of the attempts, only thing that was not alike, is that in attempt one we ignored the limits (upper and lower limit) and at the final step we put them to convert $I$ into a definite integral. On the other, hand, in attempt $2$ we exactly imitated what we did in attempt $1$ just that, here, at each step we were writing the upper and lower limits. My question, is, why this mysterious thing is occuring ? Both of the simplication in the two attempts should have been same. Where does the difference occur , in either of the two cases ? Another (Unexplained) Absurdity : If in Attempt $2$ we took the substitution $t=(x-f(x))^{2016}$ then things would have been different and we would have got, $I=0.$ The corresponding calculation, for $t=(x-f(x))^{2016}$ : $$I=\frac{\int_0^1 (x-f(x))^{2016}(1 -f'(x))dx}{2}=$$ $$\begin{align}\frac{\int_1^1 (x-f(x))^{2016}(1 -f'(x))\frac{dt}{2016(x-f(x))^{2015}(1-f'(x))}}{2}\end{align}$$ $$=0.$$ Precisely, I am looking for a convincing explanation of these apparent absurdities, using elementary real analysis (basic) elementary calculus(/basic real analysis).","If is a differentiable function in such that and .

44,The taxonomy of real functions of one real variable,The taxonomy of real functions of one real variable,,"In treatments like Spivak's Calculus , and in Pete Clark's notes here , the motivation is to describe a set of real functions of one real variable with ""sufficiently nice properties"" -- that is to say, a taxonomy of such functions. It seems to me that we can think of this taxonomy as analytic $\subset$ infintely differentiable $\subset$ n-times differentiable $\subset$ continuous $\subset$ general functions. I am trying (I think) to understand the jump from infinitely differentiable to analytic. I am at the end of Spivak's Chapter 24 where the statement is made that ""a convergent power series is always the Taylor series of the function which it defines"". That is (WLOG considering Maclaurin rather than Taylor series), if in some interval $J=(-R,R)$ we have that the function $f(x) = \sum_0^\infty a_n x^n$ converges, then it is in fact equal to its Taylor series $$a_n = \frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}.$$ But as noted in Prof. Clark's notes, we can ask the more general question: Question 12.5. Let $f : I → R$ be an infinitely differentiable function and $T(x) = \sum_0^\infty \frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!} x^n$ be its Taylor series. We may then ask: a) For which values of $x$ does $T(x)$ converge? b) If for $x \in I$ , $T(x)$ converges, do we have $T(x) = f(x)$ ? I want to ask whether the following are the only possibilities other than $f$ being analytic (I think this means equal to it's Taylor series?) everywhere it's defined: The interval of convergence $J$ of the Taylor series of $f$ is a subset of $I$ (the interval on which $f$ is defined), but $f$ is given by its Taylor series on $J$ . I believe this is given e.g. by $f(x) = \textrm{ln}(1+x)$ . I have not yet studied later chapters in Spivak but I suspect this case arises when the complex version of the function encounters a singularity at that radius. The interval of convergence $J$ of the Taylor series of $f$ equals $I$ (the interval on which $f$ is defined), but $f$ is NOT given by its Taylor series on all of $J$ . I believe this is given e.g. by $f(x) = e^{-1/x^2} \ \textrm{for} \ x \neq 0, f(0) = 0$ . Further, with respect to question 2, I'm wondering if it's possible to comment on ""what goes wrong"". Prof. Clark provides sufficient conditions for analyticity in his Theorem 12.6, but I can't quite understand why something that has the limit of its Taylor remainder converge (so that the limit of Taylor polynomials converges) would equal anything other than the function from which the Taylor polynomials were constructed? I suspect this has something to do with uniform convergence but I'm not sure. Edit: With respect to the question in the last paragraph, I suppose a possibility is that the Taylor polynomials $P_{n,f}$ of $f$ converge to some function which is not $f$ , so that the remainder $R_{n,f}$ converges too (unlike in possibility 1 above, where I think the reason the sequence of Taylor polynomial does not converge is because the remainder blows up), but it does not converge to 0?","In treatments like Spivak's Calculus , and in Pete Clark's notes here , the motivation is to describe a set of real functions of one real variable with ""sufficiently nice properties"" -- that is to say, a taxonomy of such functions.

45,How would one go about integrating $\int x^2y'dx$ ?? - Implicit Integration??,How would one go about integrating  ?? - Implicit Integration??,\int x^2y'dx,"My friend and I are attempting to do some crazy integral stuff which he came up with but I am still having trouble getting my head around, but here's the general gist of what he is trying to get at: Propose we have a function: $f(x)={\sqrt{x}}$ . This of course is easy enough to integrate in of itself but what we're trying to figure out is if we make it so ${y^2}=x$ then integrate both sides of the function, can we still get the same answer. Here's how he computed it: $y^2=x$ $y^2y'=xy'$ $\int y^2y'dx=\int xy'dx$ The $\int y^2y'dx$ can be solved using u-substitution because recall that y is a function with respect to x rather than a constant. Additionally, the $\int xy' dx$ can be solved using integration by parts where one can arrive at $\int xy'dx=xy-\int y dx$ note how that $\int ydx = Y$ so now we have: $\frac{1}{3}y^3=xy-Y$ Now we solve for $Y$ : $Y=xy-\frac{1}{3}y^3$ $Y=\frac{2}{3}y^3$ This is the correct answer, but it's just in terms of y, substituting $y=\sqrt{x}$ into the equation, we arrive at: $Y=\frac{2}{3}x^{\frac{3}{2}}$ which is the correct answer if we'd just used the power rule of integrals. Now that was just an example to see if it worked the true problem arrises from when we take a new line, notably: $x^2+y^2=1$ and ""implicitly integrate"", note the quotations, just a made up name. If we do what we normally do: $x^2y'+y^2y'=y'$ $\int x^2y'dx + \int y^2y'dx = \int y'dx$ $\int x^2y'dx + \frac{1}{3}y^{3} = y$ Our problem occurs when we attempt to integrate that $x^2$ guy. After preforming 2 integrations by parts the integral ends up containing $Y$ which is just something that we don't want to happen. So if anyone knows what to do and we're just not seeing something painfully obvious please do tell. Addendum This is work we've done on $\int x^2y'dx$ and some other stuff as per the request of StinkingBishop: If $u=x$ , $du=dx$ and $dv=xy'$ , $v=\int xy'dx$ and then by subbing into the IBP formula we arrived at: $x(xy-Y)-\int (xy-Y)dx$ which is where problems arise because now we're integrating $Y$ . Additionally, we tried taking derivatives and manipulating the equation but the furtherest we got was: (Differentiation) $2x+2yy'=0$ then $y'=\frac{-x}{y}$ $x^2+y^2=1$ $\frac{x^2}{y}+y=\frac{1}{y}$ (Recall: $y'=\frac{-x}{y}$ ) $-xy'+y=\frac{1}{y}$ (Integrating) $-(xy-Y)+Y=\int \frac{dx}{y}$ and this is where we got stuck again, if anyone can help that would be great.","My friend and I are attempting to do some crazy integral stuff which he came up with but I am still having trouble getting my head around, but here's the general gist of what he is trying to get at: Propose we have a function: .

This led me to the following question: Problem 1: Is $3$ the only positive integer value of $n$ such that $i(i-1)(i-2) \cdots (i-n)$ is a real number or a pure imaginary number? If not, can we describe all such integer values of $n$? Initial Analysis: We can view $i(i-1)(i-2) \cdots (i-n)$ as the result of applying a finite sequence of operations to $i,$ each of which involves a radial stretch from the origin and a rotation about the origin. Specifically, $i$ is moved radially outward by a factor of $\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2}\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2} \cdots \sqrt{1^2 + n^2}$ and rotated counterclockwise by the angle $\arctan 1 + \arctan 2 + \cdots + \arctan n.$ Since we don't care about the magnitude of the result, only whether we land on the real axis or the imaginary axis, Problem 1 reduces to asking whether $3$ is the only positive integer value of $n$ such that $\arctan 1 + \arctan 2 + \cdots \arctan n$ is an integer multiple of $\frac{\pi}{4}.$ One can also check that $i(i+1)(i+2)(i+3) = -10.$ This is not a coincidence. Since $\arctan 1 + \arctan 2 + \arctan 3$ is an integer multiple of $\frac{\pi}{4},$ it follows that $\arctan (-1) + \arctan (-2) + \arctan (-3) = -\left(\arctan 1 + \arctan 2 + \arctan 3 \right)$ must also be an integer multiple of $\frac{\pi}{4}.$ Other than the products $(i-3)(i-2)(i-1)(i)$ and $(i)(i+1)(i+2)(i+3)$ (and two other products obtained by omitting the $i$ factor from these two), and products of the form $(i-k)(i-k+1) \cdots (i+k-1)(i+k)$ where $k$ can be any positive integer, I don't know any product of the form $(i+m)(i+m+1) \cdots (i+n)$ for integers $m$ and $n$ with $m < n$ that equals a real number or a pure imaginary number. Problem 2: Are $(i-3)(i-2)(i-1)(i)$ and $(i)(i+1)(i+2)(i+3)$ (and two other products obtained by omitting the the $i$ factor from these two), and products of the form $(i-k)(i-k+1) \cdots (i+k-1)(i+k)$ where $k$ can be any positive integer, the only pairs of integers $(m,n)$ with $m < n$ such that $(i+m)(i+m+1) \cdots (i+n)$ is a real number or a pure imaginary number? If not, can we describe all such pairs of integers $(m,n)$? Of course, it is easy to come up problems having a broader scope, such as replacing ""$i+m$"" with an arbitrary complex number whose real and imaginary parts are integers and/or using factors that increment the imaginary part by $1$ (or increment both the real and imaginary parts by $1$) and/or using factors that increment the real part (or the imaginary part, or both the real part and the imaginary part) by a constant integer amount, etc. I suspect the answers to these problems can be obtained from a careful analysis of Carl Størmer's 1890s results involving Machin-like formulas , but my knowledge of French and of this field of mathematics is rather poor. For those interested, I suggest looking at Størmer [2]. I also suspect there is a more direct way to solve Problem 1, and perhaps also Problem 2. Personally, I am only moderately interested in this issue, but I am posting it because I thought others in this group might find this something interesting to pursue.

Thus, if $a+bi$ is real or pure imaginary, we have $a=0$ or $b=0,$ and hence the modulus of $a+bi$ equals $b$ or $a,$ and hence the modulus of $a+bi$ will be an integer. On the other hand, the modulus of $a+bi$ also equals $\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2}\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2} \cdots \sqrt{1^2 + n^2}.$ Thus, Problem 1 is equivalent to finding all positive integer values of $n$ such that $\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2}\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2} \cdots \sqrt{1^2 + n^2}$ is an integer.

Then for   any positive numbers $s_1, \dots , s_l $ such that  $ s:= \sum\nolimits_{1}^{l} s_i \ge  {\text{span} \left(\alpha \right)} $, there exists a wrinkled map   $\beta : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$ which is $\left( s - \text{span}  \left(\alpha \right) \right)$-close to $\alpha$ in $C^0$-norm,   coincides with $\alpha$ near the end-points of the interval $[a,b],$    and which has exactly $l$ wrinkles whose spans are equal to $s_1,  \dots , s_l$. I prove for the case $l=2$. By hypothesis, $\alpha $ is a cubic function with two critical points $c, d \in  \left[ a, b \right] , a< c<d<b$, such that $c$ is the maximum and $d$ is the minimum.  For convenience, we assume $\alpha (d)=0$. It implies that $\alpha (c) =\text{span}(\alpha)$. Let $\varepsilon := s_1+s_2 -  \text{span} \left(\alpha \right)$.  We have to prove that there is a wrinkled map $\beta : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $\beta$ is $\varepsilon$-close to $\alpha$ in $C^0$-norm, coincides with $\alpha$ near $a, b$, and has $2$ wrinkles $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ whose spans are equal to $s_1, s_2.$ The required function $\beta$ is a wrinkled map, i.e., by definition, there are disjoint subsets $[a_1, e_1]$ and $[e_2, b_1]$, where $a \le a_1 \le e_1  \le e_2 \le b_1 \le b$, of the interval $[a,b]$ such that over them, $\beta$ are wrinkles, which we denoted $\alpha_1, \alpha_2$; and outside them, $\beta$ is a submersion. For the points $a_1 \le e_1  \le e_2 \le b_1 $ in $[a,b]$ will be chosen later, we can define $\beta$ by $$ \beta := \begin{cases}   \text{a smooth path connected } a \text{ and } a_1 \text{ which is a  submersion};\\  \alpha_1 \text{ is a one-dimensional wrinkle on } [a_1, e_1];\\  \text{a smooth path connected } e_1 \text{ and } e_2 \text{ which is a  submersion};\\   \alpha_2 \text{ is a one-dimensional wrinkle on } [e_2, b_1]; \\  \text{a smooth path connected } b_1 \text{ and } b \text{ which is a  submersion}. \end{cases}$$ The required functions $\alpha_1, \alpha_2$ are cubic, hence it suffices to indicate four independent equations for each $\alpha_i, i=1, 2$. If we suppose $\alpha_1$ reaches maximum at $c$ and $\alpha_2$ reaches minimum at $d$, we would get two equations for each $\alpha_i, i=1,2$.  $$ \begin{cases}   \alpha_1 (c) := t_1;\\  \alpha_1^\prime (c) = 0; \end{cases}  \text{ and }  \begin{cases}  \alpha_2 (d) := t_2;\\  \alpha_2^\prime (d) = 0; \end{cases}  $$ where the values $t_1$ and $ t_2$ will be chosen later, such that the condition that $\beta$ is $\varepsilon$-close to $\alpha$ in $C^0$-norm holds, i.e.,  \begin{equation}\label{chopeq232} \begin{cases} \Vert \alpha - \alpha_1 \Vert_{C^0[a_1, e_1]} = \mathop{\text{max}}\limits_{x \in [a_1, e_1]} \vert \left( \alpha - \alpha_1 \right)(x)  \vert < \varepsilon; \\ \Vert \alpha - \alpha_2 \Vert_{C^0[e_2, b_1]} = \mathop{\text{max}}\limits_{x \in [e_2, b_1]} \vert \left( \alpha - \alpha_2 \right)(x)  \vert < \varepsilon.  \end{cases}  \end{equation}  The point $c$ is the critical point of both functions $\alpha $ and $ \alpha_1$ on $[a_1, e_1]$, so the derivative $$ \left( \alpha - \alpha_1 \right)^\prime (c) = \alpha^\prime (c)  - \alpha_1^\prime (c) = 0.$$  Therefore $c$ is one of two critical points of $\alpha - \alpha_1 $  on $[a_1, e_1]$. We could choose, for example,  $$t_1:= \alpha(c)+ \varepsilon = \text{span}(\alpha)+\varepsilon,$$ then $ \vert \left( \alpha - \alpha_1 \right)(c)  \vert = \varepsilon.$  Similarly $d$ is one of two critical points of $\alpha - \alpha_2 $  on  $[e_2,b_1]$. We could choose,  $$t_2:= \alpha(d) - \varepsilon =  -\varepsilon,$$  then $ \vert \left( \alpha - \alpha_2 \right)(d)  \vert = \varepsilon.$ Now we want to find the other extremum of $\alpha - \alpha_1 $  on $[a_1, e_1]$ and of $\alpha - \alpha_2 $  on  $[e_2,b_2]$. Because the spans of $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ are equal to $s_1, s_2$, we have one more equation for each wrinkle $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$. $$  \begin{cases} \mathop{\text{min}}\limits_{x \in [a_1, e_1]} \alpha_1 (x) = \mathop{\text{max}}\limits_{x \in [a_1, e_1]} \alpha_1 (x)  - s_1 =  \text{span}(\alpha)+\varepsilon -s_1 =s_2;\\ % \text{span}(\alpha)+ s_1 + s_2  -\text{span}(\alpha)  -s_1 =   \mathop{\text{max}}\limits_{x \in [e_2, b_1]} \alpha_2 (x) = \mathop{\text{min}}\limits_{x \in [e_2, b_1]} \alpha_2 (x) + s_2 = s_2 - \varepsilon.  \end{cases}  $$ We define the minimum value of $\alpha$ on $[a_1, e_1]$ and the maximum of $\alpha$ on $[e_2, b_1]$ so that the condition $\varepsilon$-close to $\alpha$ in $C^0$-norm holds: $$   \mathop{\text{min}}\limits_{x \in [a_1, e_1]} \alpha (x) := s_2 + \varepsilon, \text{ and } \mathop{\text{max}}\limits_{x \in [e_2, b_1]} \alpha (x)  := s_2 - 2 \varepsilon.   $$ Let  $$  \begin{cases} e_0 := \alpha^{-1} \left(s_2 + \varepsilon\right);\\  e_3 := \alpha^{-1} \left(s_2 - 2 \varepsilon\right). \end{cases}  $$ Thus we defined two cubic functions, $f_1$ reaches maximum at $c$ with value $ \text{span}(\alpha) + \varepsilon$ and minimum at $e_0$ with value $s_2$; and $f_2$  reaches maximum at $e_3$ with value $ s_2 - 2 \varepsilon $ and minimum at $d$ with value $-\varepsilon$. The intersections of $f_1$ and $\alpha$ give us two points, which we denoted $(a_1,\alpha_1(a_1))$, $(e_1,\alpha_1(e_1))$; and the intersections of $f_2$ and $\alpha$ give us two other points, which we denoted $(e_2, \alpha_2(e_2))$, $(b_1,\alpha_2(b_1))$. Finally we get the wrinkles $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$. In conclusion, for the given conditions, we could construct a wrinkled map $\beta$ which is $\varepsilon$-closed to $\alpha$ in $C^0$-norm, coincides with $\alpha$ near $a, b$, and has two wrinkles $\alpha_1, \alpha_2$ whose spans are $s_1, s_2$. Unfortunately it is wrong. In fact as the construction, the $C^0$-norm of $\alpha_1-\alpha$ would be greater than $\epsilon$. The point is, I constructed $ e_0 $ to be the point which $\alpha_1$ reaches its local minimum $s_2$ and $\alpha(e_0)=s_2+\epsilon$. But $\alpha_1-\alpha$ does not reach its local minimum at $ e_0$. Vague idea: the equations and inequalities for $\alpha_1$ are: 1)     Maximality at $c$; 2)     Span$(\alpha_1)$ equals $s_1$; 3)     Value at $a$ (or $a_1$); 4)     [Inequality] range of $\alpha_1-\alpha$ is smaller than $\epsilon$.

Then for   any positive numbers $s_1, \dots , s_l $ such that  $ s:= \sum\nolimits_{1}^{l} s_i \ge  {\text{span} \left(\alpha \right)} $, there exists a wrinkled map   $\beta : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$ which is $\left( s - \text{span}  \left(\alpha \right) \right)$-close to $\alpha$ in $C^0$-norm,   coincides with $\alpha$ near the end-points of the interval $[a,b],$    and which has exactly $l$ wrinkles whose spans are equal to $s_1,  \dots , s_l$. I prove for the case $l=2$. By hypothesis, $\alpha $ is a cubic function with two critical points $c, d \in  \left[ a, b \right] , a< c<d<b$, such that $c$ is the maximum and $d$ is the minimum.  For convenience, we assume $\alpha (d)=0$. It implies that $\alpha (c) =\text{span}(\alpha)$. Let $\varepsilon := s_1+s_2 -  \text{span} \left(\alpha \right)$.  We have to prove that there is a wrinkled map $\beta : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $\beta$ is $\varepsilon$-close to $\alpha$ in $C^0$-norm, coincides with $\alpha$ near $a, b$, and has $2$ wrinkles $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ whose spans are equal to $s_1, s_2.$ The required function $\beta$ is a wrinkled map, i.e., by definition, there are disjoint subsets $[a_1, e_1]$ and $[e_2, b_1]$, where $a \le a_1 \le e_1  \le e_2 \le b_1 \le b$, of the interval $[a,b]$ such that over them, $\beta$ are wrinkles, which we denoted $\alpha_1, \alpha_2$; and outside them, $\beta$ is a submersion.

It would be great to have a closed formula that relates $\lambda_f$ versus $\lambda_p$ along an iso-line. For the symmetric case $\lambda_f=\lambda_p$ I have found a fairly accurate and astonishingly simple approximation (error < 2%) $$ H(\lambda_f=\lambda_p) \approx \frac{\lambda_f}{\sqrt{\lambda_f^4+\lambda_f^2/2+4}} $$ The accurate expression for this case can be cast in the form $$ H(\lambda_f=\lambda_p) = \frac{I_2(f)}{K(f)K(\frac{1-f}{1+f})} \quad I_2(f)=\frac{1}{1+f}\int_{\alpha=0}^{\pi/2}\frac{F(\alpha,\frac{2\sqrt f}{1+f})d\alpha}{\sqrt{1-\frac{4 f}{(1+f)^2}\cos^2\alpha}}$$  where $I_2$ is only a weak function of $f$ and $I_2(f)=I_2(\frac{1-f}{1+f})$ (by numerical inspection). $I_2(0)=I_2(1)=\pi^2/8$ and the maximum is $I_2(\sqrt 2-1)=(\sqrt 2/3) K^2(\sqrt{2}-1)$. Using the integral definition of $F(\alpha,k)$ one can rewrite  $$ I_2(f)=\int_{x=0}^{1}\int_{y=0}^{\sqrt{1-x^2}}\frac{(1+f)dy dx}{\sqrt{1-x^2}\sqrt{1-y^2}\sqrt{(1+f)^2-4 f x^2}\sqrt{(1+f)^2-4 f y^2}} $$ Transforming into cylindrical coordinates and computing over the 90° angle gives  $$ I_2(f)=\int_{x=0}^{1} \frac{K(\frac{(1-f)x\sqrt{1+6f+f^2-4fx}}{(1+f)(2-x)\sqrt{1+2f+f^2-4fx}})}{(2-x)\sqrt{1+2f+f^2-4fx}}dx = \int_{z=0}^{1} \frac{K(\frac{1-f}{1+f}\frac{1-z}{1+z}\sqrt{\frac{(1+f)^2+4fz}{(1-f)^2+4fz}})}{(1+z)\sqrt{(1-f)^2+4fz}}dz  $$ where we have only a complete instead of an incomplete elliptic integral - however, I still do not see the symmetry:- The last integral has some similarity to (131) in ""Elliptic integral Evaluations of Bessel moments"", by Bailey,Borwein,Broadhurst,Glasser (free download https://arxiv.org/pdf/0801.0891.pdf ). If we set $\hat f = 2f/(1+f^2)$ then there is a one-to-one relation between $f$ and $\hat f$ in the interval [0,1]. Then the transformation $f\to (1-f)/(1+f)$ means $\hat f\to\sqrt{1-\hat f^2}$ and the conjecture is $I_2(\hat f)=I_2(\sqrt{1-\hat f^2})$. In the general case $\lambda_f \ne \lambda_p$ we set $\hat p = (1-p)^2/(1+6p+p^2)$. Again there is a one-to-one relation between $p$ and $\hat p$ in the interval [0,1]. Then the transformation $p\to (\sqrt{1+p}-\sqrt{2\sqrt{p}})^{2} (\sqrt{1+p}+\sqrt{2\sqrt{p}})^{-2}$ means $\hat p\to\sqrt{1-\hat p^2}$ and the conjecture is $H(\hat f,\hat p)=H(\sqrt{1-\hat f^2}, \sqrt{1-\hat p^2})$. By partial integration one can show that $H$ and $I_1$ remain the same, if $\lambda_f$ and $\lambda_p$ are swapped.",,"['calculus', 'integration', 'definite-integrals', 'special-functions', 'elliptic-integrals']"

76,Questions concerning the Integration of Integer Tetration,Questions concerning the Integration of Integer Tetration,,"I've been interested in finding the antiderivative of integer tetration, a function defined as iterative exponentiation. Integer tetration is written as $^n$$x$ where $^1$$x =x$, $^2$$x =x^x$, $^3$$x =$ $x^{\scriptscriptstyle x^{x}}$ and so forth where $n=1,2,3\ldots$ (Further info can be found on Wikipedia . One solution to the problem is found on the MathWorld page (see equation #10), but the given solution is difficult to evaluate; accordingly, I am searching for an simpler representation than the result given. (Note that my questions are located at the bottom of this post, and number theorists are encouraged to skip to that point... everything leading up to the questions is background and context.) Using Wolfram Alpha I found the Puiseux series of $x^x$ to be the following:$$1+ x\log(x)+\frac{1}{2}x^2\log^2(x) + \frac{1}{6}x^3\log^3(x)\ldots$$ $$ = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n \log^n(x)}{n!} \qquad 1.$$  As such, the antiderivative can be found simply by integrating the series: $$\int x^xdx = \int \bigg(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n \log^n(x)}{n!}\bigg)dx = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\bigg(\frac{1}{n!}\int x^n \log^n(x)dx\bigg)$$ We then note the following: (again, pulled from Wolfram Alpha) $$\int x^n \log^n(x)dx = \frac{\Gamma(n+1,-(n+1)\log(x))(-n-1)^{-n} }{(n+1)} \qquad 2. $$ All that is left is to substitute in Equation 2 and convert the denominator the gamma function. $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\bigg(\frac{1}{n!}\int x^n \log^n(x)dx\bigg) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\bigg(\frac{\Gamma(n+1,-(n+1)\log(x))(-n-1)^{-n} }{\Gamma(n+2)}\bigg)$$ This solution can be checked by substituting in x=1, yielding the Sophomore's Dream : $$ \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\bigg(\frac{\Gamma(n+1,-(n+1)\log(1))(-n-1)^{-n} }{\Gamma(n+2)}\bigg) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\bigg(\frac{\Gamma(n+1,0)(-n-1)^{-n} }{\Gamma(n+2)}\bigg)$$ $$= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\bigg(\frac{\Gamma(n+1)(-n-1)^{-n} }{\Gamma(n+2)}\bigg) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\bigg((-1)^n(n+1)^{n+1}\bigg)$$ $$= 1-\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{27}-\frac{1}{64}\,\ldots \, = -\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-n)^{-n} = \int_{0}^{1}x^xdx$$ Further, any other definite integral of $x^x$ can be calculated the same way. (Note that $F'(x)$ is $x^x$) $$\int_{0}^{r}x^xdx = F(r) - \lim_{a\to 0}F(a)$$ $$= F(r) - \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\lim_{a\to 0}\bigg(\frac{\Gamma(n+1,-(n+1)\log(a))(-n-1)^{-n} }{\Gamma(n+2)}\bigg) = F(r)$$ No standard Puiseux series can be found for $^n$$x$ when $n>2$, although Wolfram Alpha tells me that ""Generalized Puiseux series"" exists for these functions. For $^3$$x$ the series is as such: $$x + x^2\log^2(x) + \frac{1}{2}x^3\log^3(x)[1+\log(x)] + \frac{1}{6}x^4\log^4(x)[1+3\log(x)+\log^2(x)]\ldots$$ Notice that this series closely resembles Equation 1, except for the additional powers of $\log(x)$. If we temporarily exclude the coefficients on these additional terms we find that the $n^{th}$ term of the series is multiplied by $\sum_{n=0}^{n-2}\log^n(x)$ (except for the first term). As a result, we can represent the series as follow, where the additional coefficients are represented as $C_{kn}$ $$\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}\bigg[\frac{x^n\log^n(x)}{\Gamma(n)}\sum_{k=0}^{n-2}\bigg(C_{kn}\log^k(x)\bigg)\bigg] = \sum_{n=2}^{\infty}\sum_{k=0}^{n-2}\bigg(\frac{C_{kn}\log^{k+n}(x)x^n}{\Gamma(n)}\bigg)  \qquad 3. $$ Listing the coefficients generated, we get $[1],[1,1],[1,3,1],[1,7,6,1]\ldots$ A quick search on the OEIS revealed that these are in fact the Stirling numbers of the second kind, written as $S_n^k$ or $S(n,k)$. Substituting this into the series representation above, we get the following series for $^3$$x$: $$x + \sum_{n=2}^{\infty}\sum_{k=0}^{n-2}\bigg(\frac{S_{n-1}^{k+1}\log^{k+n}(x)x^n}{\Gamma(n)}\bigg) = x + \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\sum_{k=0}^{n}\bigg(\frac{S_{n+1}^{k+1}\log^{k+n+2}(x)x^{n+2}}{\Gamma(n+2)}\bigg)$$ Going through a similar process to the one outlined for $x^x$, $\int$ $^3$$xdx$ can be shown to be the following equation: $$\frac{x^2}{2} + \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\sum_{k=0}^{n}\bigg(\frac{\Gamma[n+3+k,-(n+3)\log(x)]S_{n+1}^{k+1}}{\Gamma(n+2)(-(n+3))^{n+3+k}}\bigg)$$ Likewise, we find that $$\int_{0}^{r} {^3x}dx = \frac{r^2}{2} + \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\sum_{k=0}^{n}\bigg(\frac{\Gamma[n+3+k,-(n+3)\log(r)]S_{n+1}^{k+1}}{\Gamma(n+2)(-(n+3))^{n+3+k}}\bigg)$$ The hard part is when we get to the generalized Puiseux series for $^4x$, which is: $$1+x\log(x)+\frac{1}{2}x^2\log^2(x)[1+2\log(x)]+\frac{1}{6}x^3 \log^3(x) [1+9 \log(x)+3\log^2(x)]+\ldots$$ $$***$$ Here is where the real questions start. This series has the first few powers of $x\log(x)$ as $x^x$, namely $1+x\log(x)$. I wonder if this is related to the fact that the function $y = (x^x)^y$ is the same as $y = (^{2n}x)^y$? Equivalently, $y=x^y$ is the same as $y = (^{2n-1}x)^y$. We can see this same symmetry in that for all $^{2n-1}x$ I checked (up to $^7x$) the first two terms are $x+x^2\log^2(x)$, while for all $^{2n}x$ I checked the first two terms are $1+x\log(x)$. Thus, my first question is somewhat broad... Is there any simple explanation for this symmetry ? My next question concerns the series for $^4x$. We can represent this in a very similar form to Equation 1 , except for the additional powers of $\log(x)$, reminiscent of the additions to Equation 1 . Thus, we get the form $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \bigg[\frac{x^n \log^n(x)}{n!}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\bigg(C_{kn}\log^k(x)\bigg)\bigg] = 1 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \bigg[\frac{x^n \log^n(x)}{n!}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\bigg(C_{kn}\log^k(x)\bigg)\bigg]$$ $$= 1 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\bigg(\frac{x^n \log^{n+k}(x)C_{kn}}{n!}\bigg) = 1 + \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\sum_{k=0}^{n}\bigg(\frac{x^{n+1} \log^{n+1+k}(x)C_{kn}}{\Gamma(n+2)}\bigg)$$ Having already worked with $^2x$ and $^3x$ integrating this series would not be difficult, but I can't figure out what the constants are. Thus, my main question is: What is the pattern for the numbers $[1,2],[1,9,3],[1,28,36,4],[1,75,245,110,5],[1,186,1290,1410,300,6]...$ where each number is some $C_{kn}$? I have noticed that the first member of each set is 1, and the second term in each set is $nS_n^2$ (where the first set is n=2, the second is n=3, and so forth and $S_n^k$ are the Stirling numbers of the second kind). The nth set also contains n members (using the definition of n above), and the final member of each set is n. Other than these observations, I can't find a way to represent these numbers. My final question is ""How do we calculate a generalized Puiseux series, specifically for $^nx$ where $n>2$? I feel that if I had more knowledge on how these series are calculated I could gain insight into my other questions, but I cannot find much literature on finding generalized Puiseux series, let alone literature elementary enough for me to understand and apply to tetration. (Note: If I should split this post into three seperate posts for each question I can, but I included them all here to avoid posting excessively. If I should edit my tags to reach a wider audience I will do so, although I am not sure what specific fields of mathematics my questions fall under)","I've been interested in finding the antiderivative of integer tetration, a function defined as iterative exponentiation. Integer tetration is written as $^n$$x$ where $^1$$x =x$, $^2$$x =x^x$, $^3$$x =$ $x^{\scriptscriptstyle x^{x}}$ and so forth where $n=1,2,3\ldots$ (Further info can be found on Wikipedia . One solution to the problem is found on the MathWorld page (see equation #10), but the given solution is difficult to evaluate; accordingly, I am searching for an simpler representation than the result given. (Note that my questions are located at the bottom of this post, and number theorists are encouraged to skip to that point... everything leading up to the questions is background and context.) Using Wolfram Alpha I found the Puiseux series of $x^x$ to be the following:$$1+ x\log(x)+\frac{1}{2}x^2\log^2(x) + \frac{1}{6}x^3\log^3(x)\ldots$$ $$ = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n \log^n(x)}{n!} \qquad 1.$$  As such, the antiderivative can be found simply by integrating the series: $$\int x^xdx = \int \bigg(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n \log^n(x)}{n!}\bigg)dx = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\bigg(\frac{1}{n!}\int x^n \log^n(x)dx\bigg)$$ We then note the following: (again, pulled from Wolfram Alpha) $$\int x^n \log^n(x)dx = \frac{\Gamma(n+1,-(n+1)\log(x))(-n-1)^{-n} }{(n+1)} \qquad 2. $$ All that is left is to substitute in Equation 2 and convert the denominator the gamma function. $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\bigg(\frac{1}{n!}\int x^n \log^n(x)dx\bigg) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\bigg(\frac{\Gamma(n+1,-(n+1)\log(x))(-n-1)^{-n} }{\Gamma(n+2)}\bigg)$$ This solution can be checked by substituting in x=1, yielding the Sophomore's Dream : $$ \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\bigg(\frac{\Gamma(n+1,-(n+1)\log(1))(-n-1)^{-n} }{\Gamma(n+2)}\bigg) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\bigg(\frac{\Gamma(n+1,0)(-n-1)^{-n} }{\Gamma(n+2)}\bigg)$$ $$= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\bigg(\frac{\Gamma(n+1)(-n-1)^{-n} }{\Gamma(n+2)}\bigg) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\bigg((-1)^n(n+1)^{n+1}\bigg)$$ $$= 1-\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{27}-\frac{1}{64}\,\ldots \, = -\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-n)^{-n} = \int_{0}^{1}x^xdx$$ Further, any other definite integral of $x^x$ can be calculated the same way. (Note that $F'(x)$ is $x^x$) $$\int_{0}^{r}x^xdx = F(r) - \lim_{a\to 0}F(a)$$ $$= F(r) - \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\lim_{a\to 0}\bigg(\frac{\Gamma(n+1,-(n+1)\log(a))(-n-1)^{-n} }{\Gamma(n+2)}\bigg) = F(r)$$ No standard Puiseux series can be found for $^n$$x$ when $n>2$, although Wolfram Alpha tells me that ""Generalized Puiseux series"" exists for these functions. For $^3$$x$ the series is as such: $$x + x^2\log^2(x) + \frac{1}{2}x^3\log^3(x)[1+\log(x)] + \frac{1}{6}x^4\log^4(x)[1+3\log(x)+\log^2(x)]\ldots$$ Notice that this series closely resembles Equation 1, except for the additional powers of $\log(x)$. If we temporarily exclude the coefficients on these additional terms we find that the $n^{th}$ term of the series is multiplied by $\sum_{n=0}^{n-2}\log^n(x)$ (except for the first term). As a result, we can represent the series as follow, where the additional coefficients are represented as $C_{kn}$ $$\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}\bigg[\frac{x^n\log^n(x)}{\Gamma(n)}\sum_{k=0}^{n-2}\bigg(C_{kn}\log^k(x)\bigg)\bigg] = \sum_{n=2}^{\infty}\sum_{k=0}^{n-2}\bigg(\frac{C_{kn}\log^{k+n}(x)x^n}{\Gamma(n)}\bigg)  \qquad 3. $$ Listing the coefficients generated, we get $[1],[1,1],[1,3,1],[1,7,6,1]\ldots$ A quick search on the OEIS revealed that these are in fact the Stirling numbers of the second kind, written as $S_n^k$ or $S(n,k)$.

Let's consider two approximations of the exponential function : The first one is the most common one $f_k(x)=\left(1+\frac{x}{c^k}\right)^{c^k}$ and the second one is $q_k(x)=\displaystyle\sum _{p=0}^k\frac{c^{\frac{p^2+p}{2}}}{\displaystyle\prod _{n=1}^p(c^n-1)\prod_{n=1}^{k-p}(1-c^n)}f_p\left(x\right)$.

In the following question, we'll stay with with fixed $c,k$ However, after experimenting a bit on desmos , I have conjectured some results I am not able to prove mathematically, and therefore have some question : One can see (on the desmos graph) that there exists a non empty interval $I$ around $0$ on which $q_k(x)$ is a better approximation of $e^x$ than $f_k(x)$ (by that I mean that $\forall x\in I,|q_k(x)-e^x|\le|f_k(x)-e^x|$). As $c$ or $k$ increase, this interval gets larger and larger. How can one prove that such an interval exists ? What are the bounds of this interval ?

90,Why does this proof of the chain rule not work?,Why does this proof of the chain rule not work?,,"Why is this proof not valid? Here is my ""rigorized"" version: We write $$\frac{d}{dx}f\big(g(x)\big)=\lim_{b\to a}\frac{f\big(g(b)\big)-f\big(g(a)\big)}{b-a}=\lim_{b\to a}\left[\frac{f\big(g(b)\big)-f\big(g(a)\big)}{g(b)-g(a)}\cdot\frac{g(b)-g(a)}{b-a}\right]$$ Now we split the limit up to get $$\lim_{b\to a}\left[\frac{f\big(g(b)\big)-f\big(g(a)\big)}{g(b)-g(a)}\right]\cdot\lim_{b\to a}\left[\frac{g(b)-g(a)}{b-a}\right]$$ In the first limit, we can set $y=g(x)$. Then by differentiability, and hence continuity, of $g$, we have $y\to g(a)$ as $x\to a$. Therefore the first limit can be expressed as $$\lim_{y\to g(a)}\left[\frac{f\big(y\big)-f\big(g(a)\big)}{y-g(a)}\right]$$ So we get, by definition of the derivative, $$\frac{d}{dx}f\big(g(x)\big)=f'\big(g(x)\big)\,g'(x)$$ There are two objections given to this proof. The first is that one cannot multiply by the quantity $\big(g(b)-g(a)\big)/\big(g(b)-g(a)\big)$ as $g$ may be constant around $x=a$ and the expression would then be undefined. However, it seems obvious that we can simply consider the case of $g$ constant separately (and the case of $g'$ not defined due to 'infinite oscillations', the difficulty cited in the wiki article), where it is easily seen that the formula is valid. (Indeed, this exact point is made in the comments under the answer to this question .) The second is that the limit substitution is not justified. I don't understand this either. That limit rule (in which such substitutions are allowed for continuous functions) could easily be proven, but that has nothing to do with the chain rule. This is the objection given in an answer to this question. I found three other relevant sources. The first proof in the Wikipedia article explicitly avoids the proof above on the basis that the expression noted may be undefined. In the last page of this PDF the author offers students $3$ points if they can explain why the argument I gave above is a flawed proof. In this PDF the author similarly showcases the flawed proof, and then moves on to the 'real' proof. The 'real' proofs are, shall we say, 'not pretty'. I am wondering if this salvaged version of the intuitive proof really does not work, and why? EDIT: THEORETICAL ADDENDUM FOR THE CASE OF INFINITE OSCILLATIONS Suppose that $g(a)=g(b)$ for infinitely many $b$ in all neighborhoods of $a$. Then I claim: if $g'(a)$ is defined, it must equal $0$. Proof. The quantity $$\frac{g(x)-g(a)}{x-a}$$ can be made equal to $0$ by picking an appropriate $b$ in the interval $(a-\delta,a)\cup (a,a+\delta)$ regardless of how small $\delta>0$ is. Therefore there does not exist, for every $\epsilon>0$, a $\delta>0$ such that the difference quotient is always within $\epsilon$ of any limiting value not equal to $0$. For the limit $L\ne 0$, take $\epsilon=|L|/2$. As the limit must exist by hypothesis, it exists and equals $0$. Next I claim: the chain rule is valid in this case. Proof. The chain rule formula returns $f'(g(a))g'(a)=f'(g(a))\cdot 0=0$ in this case. We prove that, in fact, the derivative is equal to zero. Because $g'(a)=0$, we can make $$|g(x)-g(a)|<\epsilon |x-a|$$ true for any $\epsilon>0$ by picking an appropriate $\delta>0$. Then suppose that $f'(g(a))=c$. We have $$|f(x)-f(g(a))|<\max\{|c+\epsilon|,|c-\epsilon|\}|x-g(a)|$$ for any $\epsilon>0$ when $x$ is sufficiently close to $g(a)$. So make $|x-a|$ sufficiently small for all conditions. Then we have $$|f(g(x))-f(g(a))|<\max\{|c+\epsilon|,|c-\epsilon|\}|g(x)-g(a)|$$ $$\frac{|f(g(x))-f(g(a))|}{|x-a|}<\max\{|c+\epsilon|,|c-\epsilon|\}\frac{|g(x)-g(a)|}{|x-a|}$$ But $$\frac{|g(x)-g(a)|}{|x-a|}<\epsilon^*$$ ($\epsilon^*$ the first epsilon) so we have $$\left|\frac{f(g(x))-f(g(a))}{x-a}\right|<\epsilon^*\max\{|c+\epsilon|,|c-\epsilon|\}$$ Therefore the difference quotient can be made arbitrarily small, and hence $$\frac{d}{dx}\left(f\big(g(x)\big)\right)=0$$ as was to be shown.","Why is this proof not valid?

I figured that the denominator can be rewritten as $ (x^2-4)(x+1) $. And then I tried to factor something in the numerator but couldn't see anything interesting.
