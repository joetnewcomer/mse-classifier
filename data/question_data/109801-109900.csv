Actually, in order to get a representation of $G$ on $F(G)$, i.e. $\alpha_g\alpha_h=\alpha_{gh}$, we must modify the definition and use $\alpha_g(f)(x):=f(b(x,g^{-1}))$. Otherwise we get an anti-representation . Let $G$ be a finite group and let $\rho:G\rightarrow GL(V)$ be a representation of $G$.

5,Abelian Group Element Orders [duplicate],Abelian Group Element Orders [duplicate],,"This question already has answers here : Order of elements is lcm-closed in abelian groups (6 answers) Closed 8 years ago . I want to show that if a finite abelian group has elements of order $m$ and $n$ then it will have an element of order $\text{lcm}(m,n)$. First I proved the lemma if $a$ has order $m$ and $b$ has order $n$ with $m,n$ coprime, then $ab$ has order $mn$. This is because the subgroups $\langle a \rangle$ and $\langle b \rangle$ have trivial intersection (because the order of their intersection must divide their orders $m$ and $n$, which is a consequence of it being a subgroup of both), which implies $a^{i} \in \langle b \rangle$ iff $i \equiv 0 \pmod n$, and similarly $b^{i} \in \langle a \rangle$ iff $i \equiv 0 \pmod m$. Using that we deduce that $(ab)^i = a^i b^i = 1$ iff $i \equiv 0 \pmod {mn}$. So if $a$ was an element of order $m$ and $b$ and element of $n$ with $g = \gcd(m,n) \not = 1$ I thought that $\text{lcm}(m,n) = \frac{m}{g}n$ so and $\frac{m}{g},n$ are coprime so I should construct an element (from $a$) with order $\frac{m}{g}$ then conclude the theorem by the lemma. For the construction I think it's just $a^g$. I just have a nagging doubt about the correctness of the second proof, did I miss some important detail?

(Here we need a modification: $HK$ needs to be replaced by $\langle H, K \rangle$.)","In the spirit of category theory, we use relations between objects to describe the object themselves. In the same sense I want to use the lattice structure of subgroups to decide whether a subgroup is normal.  We know that if $H \lhd G$ and $K \subset G$, then there is a lattice preserving bijection from subgroups of $K$ containing $H \cap K$ to subgroups of $HK$ containing $H$. This gives us a categorical description of normality. My question is: Does the converse hold? That is, if for every $K \subset G$, this bijection also holds, must $H$ be normal in $G$? (Here we need a modification: $HK$ needs to be replaced by $\langle H, K \rangle$.)",,"['group-theory', 'category-theory', 'normal-subgroups', 'lattice-orders']"

Is it always possible to expand $\phi$ to an automorphism on $G$? Explicitly, is there an automorphism $\sigma \in Aut_G$ s.t $\sigma \vert _{H_1}=\phi$? Efforts so far At first I considered defining $\sigma$ by letting $$\sigma\left(g\right)=\begin{cases} \phi\left(g\right) & g\in H_{1}\\ \phi^{-1}\left(g\right) & g\in H_{2}\\ g & else \end{cases}$$ but obviously such a $\sigma$ is not well-defined for elements in $H_1 \cap H_2$ (other than $e$). I then tried $$\sigma\left(g\right)=\begin{cases} \phi\left(g\right) & g\in H_{1}\setminus H_{2}\\ \phi^{-1}\left(g\right) & g\in H_{2}\setminus H_{1}\\ g & else \end{cases}$$ but then I'm unable to prove injectivity, for example when $x\in H_{1}\setminus H_{2},y\in H_{1}\cap H_{2}$ we get $\sigma\left(x\right)=\phi\left(x\right),\sigma\left(y\right)=y$ so it is unclear why $\sigma\left(x\right)\neq\sigma\left(y\right)$.
