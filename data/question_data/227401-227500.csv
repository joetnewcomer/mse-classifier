5,Is the defining representation of the orthogonal group (over any field) irreducible?,Is the defining representation of the orthogonal group (over any field) irreducible?,,"Let $V$ be a vector space over an algebraically closed field, equipped with a symmetric, non-degenerate, bilinear form $\beta : V \times V \to \mathbb{C}$. Let $O \subset GL(V)$ be the group of linear transformations preserving $\beta$. $O$ is the orthogonal group. Is $V$ irreducible as a representation of $O$? I can prove this using a fact from algebraic geometry, but this only works over $\mathbb{C}$ (as far a I know). Proposition: Work over $\mathbb{C}$. Let $X$ be a the quadric hypersurface of $\{v : \beta(v,v) = 0\}$. Then $X$ is a homogeneous space for the action of $O$, that is, the action of $O$ is transitive. Pf: We can assume that $\beta(v,w) = \Sigma v_i w_i$. Let $G^+$ be the space of oriented $2$ planes in $\mathbb{R}^n$, equipped with the usual dot product. For an orthonormal basis $v_1, v_2$, the point $w = v_1 + i v_2 \in \mathbb{C}^n$ satisfies $w^T w = 0$. A different choice of orthonormal basis would changed $w$ by a phase, and $w$ determines the orthonormal basis up to phase. Morover, if $w = v_1 + i v_2$ satisfies $w^T w = 0$, it is easy to see that $\alpha v_1, \alpha v_2$ are orthonormal, for some $\alpha$. Thus there is a correspondence between $G^+$ and the (projective) quadric hypersurface $X$. This correspondence shows us how to prove that the action is transitive. Let $[x],[y] \in X$, with $x = x_1 + x_2 i$ and $y = y_1 + y_2 i$ so that $x_1, x_2$ and $y_1, y_2$ are each an orthonormal pair of vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$.

Moreover, this action is in $O(\mathbb{C})$, which can be seen by explicitely comparing $\beta( A(s + it) , A(x + iy))$ with $\beta(s + it, x + iy)$. QED Lemma: The action of $O$ is transitive on $X^c$. (This is true because any $v \in V$ with $\beta(v,v) \not = 0$ can be extended into an orthonormal basis for $\beta$. ""QED"".)

20,Axiomatic Dimension Theory,Axiomatic Dimension Theory,,"While reading Eisenbud's book in introductory commutative algebra, at the start of the chapter on dimension theory, he introduces several axioms for dimension theory, and heuristics as to why they are reasonable axioms. These axioms are: D1) Dimension is a local property in the sense that the dimension of a ring should be the supermum of the dimensions of the localizations of $R$ at prime ideals, and that completing this localization should preserve dimension. D2) That nilpotents should not effect dimension in the sense that the dimension of the ring before and after quotienting by a nilpotent ideal should be the same. D3) Dimension is preserved by maps with finite fibers. D4) If $k$ is a field, then the dimension of the formal power series ring over $k$ in $r$ variables should have dimension $r$. Eisenbud explains that these 4 axioms characterize the Krull dimension in the case of Noetherian rings. He then goes on to give several other notions of dimension, and explain when they coincide and when they do not, as well as provide geometric intuition for them. This is all well and good, and I find the geometric intuition helpful. On the other hand, the many different theories are a lot to swallow all at once, and there are many notions that follow. I think it would help me to have an overarching system that I can construct these notions within, an axiomatized treatment of dimension theory in commutative algebra which I could read in parallel, since Eisenbud does a pretty good job giving me the intuition I need to understand what's going on. This would be especially helpful because I imagine that the situation is not unlike what happens in homology theory in topology. There is a class of spaces you can study with some homology theory, and when you work outside that kind of space or theory, some of the axioms needs to be weakened, replaced or just dropped, leading to exotic theories. For me, having this spelled out helps me to stay mentally organized, and keeps me from confusing notions and theories. As such, a treatment of dimension theory in commutative algebra which does this would be absolutely wonderful. Part of me is suspicious that a good chunk of what I'm looking for belongs to algebraic geometry - the notion of dimensions being tied up intrinsically with the varieties these objects correspond to. I've seen some introductory algebraic geometry in Shafarevich, so I don't mind looking around at some other references, but I'm trying to stay away from behemoths like Hartshorne until I understand some of these notions better.

Set $R = k[\{x_\alpha\}]$ , and let $S$ be the $R$ -algebra: $$ S = \frac{R[y_0,y_1,y_2]}{\left(\sum_\alpha x_\alpha y_0^{a_0}y_1^{a_1}y_2^{a_2}\right)}.$$ Show that: $(a)$ if we invert any $x_\alpha$ , then the family becomes flat. That is, the $R[x_\alpha^{-1}]$ -algebra $S[x_\alpha^{-1}]$ is flat, by showing that it is a free module (it is not finitely generated). $(b)$ $S$ is an integral domain, and moreover that it contains $R$ , so that it is torsion-free as a $R$ -module. $(c)$ $S$ is actually not flat over $R$ , by proving and using the following two facts: If $S$ is a flat module over a ring $R$ and $R \to T$ is any map of rings, then $S\otimes_R T$ is flat over $T$ . There is a map of rings $R = k[\{x_\alpha\}] \to k[t] = T$ , such that $$T \otimes_R S = \frac{k[t,y_0,y_1,y_2]}{(ty_0^d)}$$ is not a flat $T$ -algebra. I understand geometrically that this corresponds to all projective curves of degree $d$ , and that the $x_\alpha$ represent the ""coefficients"" of the curves. I also know that the fiber of any prime $P$ (essentially picking out a specific set of constants to get an irreducible curve) is a polynomial ring over $\text{Frac}(P)$ modulo the equation of degree $d$ that we choose. I can prove part $(b)$ without too much trouble, but I am very much stuck on part $(a)$ .

I guess it is obvious that any such torus is homeomorphic to the topological space $\mathbb{C}/L(\omega_1,\omega_2)$ (with the quotient topology) for some $\omega_1,\omega_2\in\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\}, \frac{\omega_1}{\omega_2}\notin\mathbb{R}$, but is it obvious that one cannot put a complex structure on $T_{\omega_1,\omega_2}$ apart from the natural one described above?",,"['algebraic-geometry', 'manifolds', 'smooth-manifolds', 'complex-geometry', 'complex-manifolds']"

The tangent cone of $V$ at the origin is defined to be  $$C(V)=V(f_{min}: f\in I(V)),$$ where $f_{min}$ is the homogeneous component of the lowest degree of $f$. My attempt: It is easy to show the direction $\subseteq$. Let $u\in C(V)$. Then $f_{min}(u)=0$ for all $f\in I(V)$. Since $g_i\in I$, it is obvious that $g_i\in I(V)$. So $g_{i,min}(u)=0$. This proves the inclusion $\subseteq$. For the other direction, let $u\in V(g_{1,min},\dots,g_{t,min})$ so that $g_{i,min}(u)=0$ for all $i$. Let $f\in I(V)$ so that $f^m\in I$ for some $m$. We claim that if $g\in I$, then $g_{min}\in\langle g_{1,min},\dots,g_{t,min}\rangle$. If the claim is true, then $(f^m)_{min}(u)=0$. Then the proof is done. My question: The field $k$ has to be algebraically closed for the bold part to be true. I cannot see how to proceed if it is not. To show the claim, I tried to use the following argument: Let $S=\{\text{LT}(f_{min}): f_{min}\not\in \langle g_{1,min},\dots,g_{t,min}\rangle\}$ and choose the minimal element. If the minimal element exists, I can finish the proof. But for a degree-anticompatible order, I cannot see that the minimal element exists. The degree can be infinitely large so there is no lower bound. What should I do? Thank you for any help!",,"['algebraic-geometry', 'groebner-basis', 'local-rings']"

Then the coordinate ring $k[X] = k[T_1, ... , T_n]/I$ acquires an ""$F$-structure,"" which is to say an $F$-subalgebra, namely $$F[X] := F[T_1, ... , T_n]/I \cap F[T_1, ... , T_n]$$ which is finitely generated and when tensored with $k$ over $F$ becomes $k[X]$.  We acquire on $X$ a subtopology of ""$F$-open sets"" i.e. subsets of $X$ whose complement in $X$ is the zero set of some collection of polynomials in $F[X]$.

Here is the intrinsic situation: An affine $k$-algebra with $F$-structure is a finitely generated, reduced $k$-algebra $A$, together with a finitely generated $F$-subalgebra $A_0$, such that $A = k \otimes_F A_0$.  The corresponding variety $X = \textrm{Spm } A$ acquires the structure of an affine $F$-variety , which means the following: 1 .  A subtopology of $F$-open sets of $X$, namely an open set $U \subseteq X$ is $F$-open if and only if $X - U$ is the zero set of an ideal which is extended from $A_0$ (which is a weaker assertion than the ideal corresponding to $X - U$ itself being extended from $A_0$!). 2 .

Noting that $D(f_i) \cap D(f_j) = D(f_if_j)$, the sheaf condition gives us an exact sequence $$ 0 \rightarrow \mathcal O_X(U) \xrightarrow{\phi} \prod\limits_i A_{f_i} \xrightarrow{\psi} \prod\limits_{i,j} A_{f_if_j}$$ and $\mathcal O_X^F(U)$ is defined as the preimage under $\phi$ of $\prod\limits_i (A_0)_{f_i}$.

Let's say my elliptic curve $C = \text{Proj}(k[X,Y,Z]/Y^2Z-X^3-aXZ^2-bZ^3)$ over some characteristic $0$ field $k$. I know that (and have the idea of why) $H^1_{dR}(C) = H^0(C,\Omega^1_{C/k}) \oplus H^1(C, \mathcal{O}_C)$. So, since $H^1_{dR}$ in particular is isomorphic to $H^{1}_{dR}(U)$ where $U = D(Z) = \text{Spec}(k[x,y]/y^2-x^3-ax-b)$, then we can deduce that $H^1_{dR}$ has a $k$-basis of $\omega, x\omega$, where $y\omega=dx$ on $U$. Since $H^0(C,\Omega^1_{C/k})$ is $0$-th sheaf cohomology of $\Omega^1$, this is $\Omega^1_C(C)$, the space of global differentials on $C$. I know that this should be 1 dimensional, since the dimensions should be the genus of the curve. Since $\omega$ is regular at $\infty=[0:1:0]$ but $x\omega$ is not (having a pole of order $2$), is this enough to imply that the basis of $\Omega^1_C(C)$ is given by the differential $\omega$? What I'm struggling to explicitly write out are all the details involved. If I consider the sheaf $\Omega^1_U$ and take global sections, we get differentials which can be written uniquely as $$ \alpha=(P(x)+Q(x)y)\omega $$ for some $P(x),Q(x) \in k[x]$. I think that I should the be doing is looking at $V = D(Y) = $ $ \text{Spec} ( k[w,z] /z- w^3 - awz^2 - bz^3) $, where $w=x/y$ and $z=1/y$. So then on $D(YZ)$ we have that $\omega = dx/y = dw - \frac{w}{z}dz$ and $$\begin{split} \alpha = &  (P(\frac{w}{z})+\frac{1}{z}Q(\frac{w}{z}))(dw-\frac{w}{z}dz) \\ = & (P(\frac{w}{z})+\frac{1}{z}Q(\frac{w}{z}))dw - (\frac{w}{z}P(\frac{w}{z})+\frac{w}{z^2}Q(\frac{w}{z}))dz \end{split}$$ If we let $R=k[w,z] /(z- w^3 - awz^2 - bz^3)$, then $$\Omega^1|_V = (Rdw\oplus Rdv)/(dz -3w^2dw - az^2dw - 2awzdz - 3bz^2dz) $$ If $Q \neq 0$ and $\deg P>0$, then the expressions $P(\frac{w}{z})+\frac{1}{z}Q(\frac{w}{z})$ and $\frac{w}{z}P(\frac{w}{z})+\frac{w}{z^2}Q(\frac{w}{z})$ are not polynomial in $w,z$ and $\alpha$ will not lie in $\Omega^1|_V$. So then we have $Q=0$ and $P(x) \in k$ and so we get that $\Omega^1_C(C)= \lbrace a \omega : a \in k \rbrace $. My question is, does this look vaguely correct or have I just gone a bit up the left with it? Would a similar argument show, say, that the differentials $dx/y, xdx/y,...,x^{g-1}dx/y$ on a hyperelliptic curve are a basis of the global differentials there? I know that on an affine chart such as $y^2=f(x)$ we get twice as many, but the other half all have poles at infinty.

I know that (and have the idea of why) $H^1_{dR}(C) = H^0(C,\Omega^1_{C/k}) \oplus H^1(C, \mathcal{O}_C)$. So, since $H^1_{dR}$ in particular is isomorphic to $H^{1}_{dR}(U)$ where $U = D(Z) = \text{Spec}(k[x,y]/y^2-x^3-ax-b)$, then we can deduce that $H^1_{dR}$ has a $k$-basis of $\omega, x\omega$, where $y\omega=dx$ on $U$. Since $H^0(C,\Omega^1_{C/k})$ is $0$-th sheaf cohomology of $\Omega^1$, this is $\Omega^1_C(C)$, the space of global differentials on $C$. I know that this should be 1 dimensional, since the dimensions should be the genus of the curve. Since $\omega$ is regular at $\infty=[0:1:0]$ but $x\omega$ is not (having a pole of order $2$), is this enough to imply that the basis of $\Omega^1_C(C)$ is given by the differential $\omega$? What I'm struggling to explicitly write out are all the details involved. If I consider the sheaf $\Omega^1_U$ and take global sections, we get differentials which can be written uniquely as $$ \alpha=(P(x)+Q(x)y)\omega $$ for some $P(x),Q(x) \in k[x]$. I think that I should the be doing is looking at $V = D(Y) = $ $ \text{Spec} ( k[w,z] /z- w^3 - awz^2 - bz^3) $, where $w=x/y$ and $z=1/y$. So then on $D(YZ)$ we have that $\omega = dx/y = dw - \frac{w}{z}dz$ and $$\begin{split} \alpha = &  (P(\frac{w}{z})+\frac{1}{z}Q(\frac{w}{z}))(dw-\frac{w}{z}dz) \\ = & (P(\frac{w}{z})+\frac{1}{z}Q(\frac{w}{z}))dw - (\frac{w}{z}P(\frac{w}{z})+\frac{w}{z^2}Q(\frac{w}{z}))dz \end{split}$$ If we let $R=k[w,z] /(z- w^3 - awz^2 - bz^3)$, then $$\Omega^1|_V = (Rdw\oplus Rdv)/(dz -3w^2dw - az^2dw - 2awzdz - 3bz^2dz) $$ If $Q \neq 0$ and $\deg P>0$, then the expressions $P(\frac{w}{z})+\frac{1}{z}Q(\frac{w}{z})$ and $\frac{w}{z}P(\frac{w}{z})+\frac{w}{z^2}Q(\frac{w}{z})$ are not polynomial in $w,z$ and $\alpha$ will not lie in $\Omega^1|_V$. So then we have $Q=0$ and $P(x) \in k$ and so we get that $\Omega^1_C(C)= \lbrace a \omega : a \in k \rbrace $. My question is, does this look vaguely correct or have I just gone a bit up the left with it? Would a similar argument show, say, that the differentials $dx/y, xdx/y,...,x^{g-1}dx/y$ on a hyperelliptic curve are a basis of the global differentials there? I know that on an affine chart such as $y^2=f(x)$ we get twice as many, but the other half all have poles at infinty. I find a lot of this sheaf cohomology and such quite conceptually challenging, and trying to assimilate it all is taking some work. Thanks",,"['algebraic-geometry', 'elliptic-curves']"

Consider the projection map to $\mathbb{A}^1 = Spec(k[t])$ down to the $x$-coordinate, i.e. $\pi: X \to \mathbb{A}^1$ is the map induced by $t \mapsto x$. For this map to be etale it has to be a local diffeomorphism, i.e. it induces an isomorphism on tangent spaces. But I'm having a little trouble working out the computation explicitly. Here's what I have on my own. We know $T_{X,p}$ for $p = (\alpha, \alpha^2)$ (i.e. corresponding to the ideal $(x-\alpha, y-\alpha^2)$ is equal to the kernel of the Jacobian map (writing $f$ for $y-x^2$) $( \partial{f}/\partial x(\alpha) \text{  |    } \partial{f}/\partial y(\alpha)) = (-2\alpha \text{ | } 1)$.

If there's a good source to do these types of explicit computations, especially anything related to explicit etale maps I'd appreciate seeing it.

In particular, the one that's giving me grief at the moment is that of an 'automorphism of a curve.' In particular, Shafarevich asks me to figure out what the automorphism group of the curve $$y^2 = x^3 + x^2$$ Now I already know in some sense what this should be. The automorphisms should be structure preserving, bijective self-maps of this curve. From clicking around the internet, I gather that the 'structure' here is the property of satisfying $f(x,y) = 0$, i.e. being solutions to the polynomial in two variables given by just shoving everything over to one side. Assuming this is correct, so far so good. Now the problem is actually computing these automorphisms. My intuition tells me that they should be maps taking $x,y$ to polynomials in $x$ and $y$, and in particular, we want them to have the same image as this equation does. I'm not 100% sure if this is quite the right idea or not, but Shafarevich doesn't seem to define the notion anywhere, so I'm kind of on my own. However, if this fuzzy notion is on the right track, I have been able to spot one such automorphism: $$ x \mapsto x, \space \space \space y \mapsto -y$$ We can see this is an automorphism, because the negative sign just squares away, and we get back the curve. Now I suspect this is the only automorphism, because intuitively I am thinking of automorphisms of curves as kind of like a group of symmetries of the curve, and we can write $$y^2= x^3 - x^2 = x^2 (x+1)$$ so that this curve has a node at the origin. That makes visualization of this curve not so hard, because between the vertical symmetry found above, and the fact that it has a node, we can kind of see what it looks like. For this reason, I think that the automorphism group, whatever that means, is just $\mathbb Z /  2\mathbb Z$. While aesthetically pleasing, it lacks rigor. Can anyone help fill me in? It would also be really nice if someone could give me some general guidelines for how to find automorphisms of other curves. Another graduate student has informed me that there are some facts from commutative algebra like 'primary ideal decomposition' and such that are useful. I do not currently know about these things (although I probably should). If your guidelines require any such facts, it would be wonderful if you could please include a reference. Edit: I forgot to include that I also know that this curve is rational. It can e parameterized by $x = t^2 - 1$, $y= t(t^2-1)$, in case this is useful information.","So, I'm starting out working through Shafarevich's Basic Algebraic Geometry, and while of course it's expected I be familiar with notions from algebra, apparently I have missed a few in my first year courses.

I'm working with an odd model, $C: \;y^2=f(x)$ over $\mathbb{A}^2_F$, where $F$ is a characteristic $0$ field. I'm looking at the de Rham cohomology $H^1_{DR}(C)$. I get why the basis of this cohomology is given by $$\omega_0 = \dfrac{dx}{y}, \omega_1= x\omega_0,\omega_2= x^2\omega_0,...,\omega_{2g-1}= x^{2g-1}\omega_0 $$ where if projective co-ordiantes are $[X:Y:Z]$ then $x = \dfrac{X}{Z}$, $y= \dfrac{Y}{Z}$. What I am trying to get my head around is the following: At infinity, $x$ has a pole of order $2$ and $y$ has a pole of order $2g+1$. This then means that $\omega_0, \omega_1,...,\omega_{g-1}$ are all holomorphic at infinity, and can be extended to regular differentials on the complete hyperelliptic curve.

Therefore, they do not extend to regular differentials at on the complete elliptic curve. I have been trying to understand this, but everywhere I go it seems like it is simply asserted. I've tried to understand the corresponding statement for elliptic curves - i.e. that $\omega=\dfrac{dx}{y}$ and $xw$ are regular and of the second kind respectively, but again it doesn't seem clear to me. If we take, as suggested in other places, the local co-ordainte $t = \dfrac{x^{g}}{y}$ then it would come out pretty quickly, but really this to me is using what we want to show to show exactly that. Needless to say, I'm a bit confused and would appreciate a nudge in the right direction. I guess it has something to do with the fact that we'd want to consider the class of the divisors $(\dfrac{X}{Z}),(\dfrac{Y}{Z})$ coming out of $K(C)$ and then consider the valuation $v_{\infty}$ at these classes, but I'm struggling a bit.","I'm trying to understand some stuff regarding differentials on a hyperelliptic curveof genus $g$.

95,Misunderstanding of the proof of the Riemann–Roch theorem,Misunderstanding of the proof of the Riemann–Roch theorem,,"I'm trying to understand the proof of the Riemann–Roch theorem presented here (p. 11). Before I state the question itself, let me give some background material (i.e., a summary of what is going on in my understanding). Let $X$ be a Riemann surface, $D$ a divisor on $X$. By $L(D)$ we   mean the set of all meromorphic functions $f$ on $X$ such that   $(f)+D\ge0$; where $(f)$ is the principal divisor of $f$ and the   notation $(f)+D\ge0$ means that all the (integer) coefficients in the divisor   $(f)+D$ are nonnegative. For the divisor $D=\sum_{i=1}^n{m_ia_i}$, we set   $V=\{(f_1,\dots,f_n)\}$, where   $f_k=\frac{c_{-m_k}}{z^k}+\dots+\frac{c_{-1}}{z}.$ It is a vector   space over $\mathbb{C}$ of dimension $\deg(D):=\sum_{i=1}^n m_i$. Define a map $\Phi: L(D)\rightarrow V$ as follows: to a function   $f\in L(D)$ it assigns the $n-$tuple with $i$th element being the principal part of Laurent's expansion of $f$ at the point $a_i$. I think I don't completely understand the definition of the set $V$ and the map $\Phi$. To get a deeper understanding, I consider the following example. Let $\mathbb{C}$ be the Riemann surface being considered and let $$D=a_1\cdot   m_1+a_2\cdot m_2+a_3\cdot m_3=0\cdot3+1\cdot 3+2\cdot4$$ be a divisor on $\mathbb{C}$ with $a_i\in\mathbb{C}$ and $m_i\in\mathbb{Z}$. Further, let $f:\mathbb{C}\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ be a meromorphic function defined by $f(z)=\frac{1}{z(z-1)^2(z-2)^3}$. It is easy to verify that $f\in L(D)$. Now, if we denote by $V(D)$ what is denoted merely by $V$ in the article ($V$ is constructed from $D$, so I find it reasonable), then $$V(D)=\bigg\{ \bigg(\frac{c_{-3}}{z^3}+\frac{c_{-2}}{z^2}+\frac{c_{-1}}{z},\frac{d_{-3}}{z^3}+\frac{d_{-2}}{z^2}+\frac{d_{-1}}{z}, \frac{e_{-4}}{z^4}+\frac{e_{-3}}{z^3}+\frac{e_{-2}}{z^2}+\frac{e_{-1}}{z}\bigg)\bigg\} $$ However, $$\Phi(f)=\\{\bigg(-\frac{1}{8z},\frac{1}{2(z-1)^2}-\frac{2}{z-1},\frac{1}{2(z-2)^3}-\frac{5}{4(z-2)^2}+\frac{17}{8(z-2)}\bigg)\\}$$ So the question which arises immediately is why $\Phi(f)\in V(D)$? Of course, it is an $n-$tuple, but it contains powers of $z-2$ for example, whereas the definition of $V$ includes only powers of $z$. Moreover, for an arbitrary $g\in L(D)$, why the $k$th element in the n-tuple $\Phi(g)$ will always have the power of $z$ (or $z-\alpha$?) not exceeding $m_{k}$ by absolute value?","I'm trying to understand the proof of the Riemann–Roch theorem presented here (p. 11).
