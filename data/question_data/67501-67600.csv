0,Counting Binary Sequences Arising from a Numerical Semigroup,Counting Binary Sequences Arising from a Numerical Semigroup,,"This is a sequel to this question , though none of the background there should be necessary. Yly's excellent answer to that question gives a few different ways of stating the below question for $n = 2$ , which may be helpful. Short version: Consider a set of positive integers $A =\{m_i\}_{i=1}^n$ with $m_i < m_{i+1}$ and $\mathrm{gcd}(A) = 1$ . Form an infinite binary sequence $s$ with $x$ $1$ s and arbitrarily many $0$ s subject to the following constraint: If there is a $0$ in position $j$ , i.e., $s_j = 0$ , then $s_{j+m_i} = 0$ for all $i$ . Let the first entry of $s$ be $s_0$ , and set $s_0 = 0$ . How many such sequences are there for fixed $x$ and $\{m_i\}$ ? More details: It quickly follows that the positions of the entries in $s$ which must be $0$ s are the elements of a numerical semigroup, i.e., an infinite set of nonnegative integers containing $0$ that is closed under addition. (Wikipedia link here.) If $S$ is a semigroup, it has a minimal set of generators, i.e., the smallest set of relatively prime non-negative integers $\{m_i\}$ such that every element in $S$ can be written in the form $\sum_i a_i m_i$ for non-negative $a_i$ . By removing superfluous $m_i$ if necessary, we can take $A$ from above to be the minimal set of generators of the semigroup $S$ that gives the positions of the required $0$ s in the sequence. The positive integers not contained in $S$ are called the gaps of $S$ , denoted $G(S)$ . The number of gaps, called the genus of $S$ , is denoted $g(S)$ . For our sequence, the gaps are the possible positions of the $1$ s. A few results quickly follow from this picture. If for fixed $\{m_i\}$ , we let $N_0(x)$ be the number of sequences beginning with a $0$ and with $x$ $1$ s, then $N_0(x = g(S)) = 1$ , when all the gaps are filled, and $N_0(x) = 0$ for $x > g(S)$ . It can also be shown that $N_0(1) = m_1 - 1$ , as only the gaps before the first generator can be filled by a solitary 1, since if $s_i = 0$ for $i = 0, 1, \ldots, m_1$ , then $s_i = 0$ for all $i$ . However, finding $N_0(x)$ for $1 < x < g(S)$ seems much more difficult. For example, Let $A = \{3,7\}$ . We see that $G(S) = \{1,2,4,5,8,11\}$ and $g(S) = 6$ . Let $x = 2$ . Clearly we can take $s_1 = s_2 = 1$ . We see that if we fill the gap at position 1 with a $0$ , i.e. set $s_1 = 0$ , then $s_4 = s_8 = s_{11} = 0$ as well. It follows that if $s_1 = 0$ , we must have $s_2 = s_5 = 1$ . If we instead take $s_1 = 1$ and $s_2 = 0$ , then $s_5 = s_8 = s_{11} = 0$ , so we can either take $s_2 = 1$ or $s_4 = 1$ . Note that setting $s_2 = 0$ in the latter case does not force $s_4 = 0$ . Thus we find $N_0(2) = 3$ , with the gaps filled with $1$ s and the actual sequences being $$(1,2) \text{ and } (1,4) \text{ and } (2,5), \qquad 011 \text{ and } 01001 \text{ and } 001001,$$ with the infinite trailing $0$ s suppressed. We can do similar computations to find $N_0(x) = 2, 2, 1$ for $x = 3, 4,$ and $5$ , respectively. The gaps filled with $1$ s and the sequences are $$\begin{matrix} x = 3: & (1,2,4) \text{ and } (1,2,5) & 01101 \text{ and } 011001\\ x = 4: & (1,2,4,5) \text{ and } (1,2,5,8) & 011011 \text{ and } 011001001\\ x = 5: & (1,2,4,5,8) & 011011001\\ \end{matrix}.$$ It is unclear how to systematize this method. Clearly some understanding of how the gaps of $S$ ""knock out"" some of the subsequent gaps when the entries of $s$ corresponding to the gaps are set to $0$ is necessary. It seems like thinking about the residues of the gaps modulo the $m_i$ might be useful, but I've been unable to make much progress for general $\{m_i\}$ . There is reason to believe (see Yly's answer to the question linked at the top) that the solution involves counting integer partitions subject to various restrictions, so a closed form for $N_0(x)$ is likely impossible, but a generating function or an expression in terms of objects derived from $S$ would still be useful.","This is a sequel to this question , though none of the background there should be necessary.

Here are some statements or heuristics: To surround territory with a certain number of stones, it is better to do squares than thin rectangles: this is a basic isoperimetric inequality/optimization problem, not particularly combinatoric.

A bit later we added the match and the fly. Since I wanted it to be a balanced tournament, the completed game looked like this: Although there is only one orientation of the $K_3$ (complete graph on three vertices) which is balanced, and the same seems to hold for $K_5$ , this is definitively not the case for $K_7$ . In fact, writing the above graph as a matrix: $ \left(\begin{array}{rrrrrrr} \mathit{Rock} & \mathit{Paper} & \mathit{Scissors} & \mathit{Fox} & \mathit{Well} & \mathit{Match} & \mathit{Fly} \\ 0 & -1 & 1 & 1 & -1 & 1 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 & -1 & -1 & 1 & -1 & 1 \\ -1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 1 & -1 \\ -1 & 1 & -1 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 & 1 & -1 & 0 & 1 & -1 \\ -1 & 1 & -1 & 1 & -1 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 & 1 & -1 & 1 & -1 & 0 \end{array}\right)$ one sees that many chunks of columns are similar: the three entries of the fox, well, match and fly columns are either identical or reversed. In order to make things more random, I thought of using a Hadamard matrix of size 8. First remove first row and column (those which are, for the standard way of writing Hadamard matrices full with 1). Then permute the rows so that the diagonal entries are all -1. Finally set the diagonal to 0 (i.e. add the identity matrix). There are a few candidates (I guess they are all isomorphic), one looks like this: $ \left(\begin{array}{rrrrrrr} 0 & -1 & 1 & -1 & 1 & 1 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 & -1 & -1 & -1 & 1 & 1 \\ -1 & 1 & 0 & -1 & 1 & -1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & -1 & -1 & -1 \\ -1 & 1 & -1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & -1 \\ -1 & -1 & 1 & 1 & -1 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 & -1 & 1 & 1 & -1 & 0 \end{array}\right) $ The resulting matrix gives an orientation of $K_7$ which is balanced. Furthermore, the columns do not have this tendency to have many entries which are identical or reversed. Here is the corresponding graph: There are [up to isomorphisms] only 3 possible games on 7 elements: the number of non-isomorphic balanced orientation of $K_{2n+1}$ , is given here . See the paper Rock-Paper-Scissors and borromean rings by Chamberland and Herman. Although it seems to me that this solution is optimal (see below) for the 7 elements game, moving up to a nine elements game, I was wondering how to quantify the quality of the graph. Basically if $F$ is the matrix of the first game, then $F^tF$ is not very uniform. Whereas if $S$ is the matrix of the second game, then $S^tS$ takes the same value everywhere except on the diagonal. Hence a measure of how optimal (how unpredictable ) the game is, would be to look at how the matrix $M^tM$ deviates from a matrix with all non-diagonal coefficients equal. My primary question is: Question: What are [other] possible ways to measure the deviation from [some form] of ideal game? i.e. what are possible definitions of optimal ? Actually, a friend of mine pointed out, that, when the number of elements is big, it is still a fun game even when the nodes are not all balanced. Indeed, if one element is stronger (in the sense that it wins against more elements than it loses), than one might be tempted to pick it. But then, it still loses against a few others, so you might tempted to pick them. And so on. Still I don't want to go primarily in this direction because: (1) I don't think it's easy to quantify; (2) My feeling is that such games reduce to a part of the whole. So a secondary question would be: Question: What are possible ways to measure the deviation from [some form] of ideal game in the unbalanced version? I was thinking about stationary measures for a random walk, but I guess there are more clever ways to go around...","While playing ``rock paper scissors'' with my daughter it became obvious that she wanted to add a few elements to the game, Specifically the fox and the well.

Although it seems to me that this solution is optimal (see below) for the 7 elements game, moving up to a nine elements game, I was wondering how to quantify the quality of the graph. Basically if is the matrix of the first game, then is not very uniform. Whereas if is the matrix of the second game, then takes the same value everywhere except on the diagonal. Hence a measure of how optimal (how unpredictable ) the game is, would be to look at how the matrix deviates from a matrix with all non-diagonal coefficients equal. My primary question is: Question: What are [other] possible ways to measure the deviation from [some form] of ideal game? i.e. what are possible definitions of optimal ? Actually, a friend of mine pointed out, that, when the number of elements is big, it is still a fun game even when the nodes are not all balanced. Indeed, if one element is stronger (in the sense that it wins against more elements than it loses), than one might be tempted to pick it. But then, it still loses against a few others, so you might tempted to pick them. And so on. Still I don't want to go primarily in this direction because: (1) I don't think it's easy to quantify; (2) My feeling is that such games reduce to a part of the whole. So a secondary question would be: Question: What are possible ways to measure the deviation from [some form] of ideal game in the unbalanced version? I was thinking about stationary measures for a random walk, but I guess there are more clever ways to go around...","K_3 K_5 K_7

Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of subsets of $[n]$ such that every set in $\mathcal{F}$ has exactly $k$ elements and for any $A,B \in \mathcal{F}$ with $A \neq B$ , $|A \cap B| \leq r$ . Denote the largest possible value of $|\mathcal{F}|$ by $m(n,k,r)$ . I'm interested in the special case when $k=2k' \leq \frac{n}{2}$ and $r = k'-1$ . My main question is as follows. What are some good lower bounds for $m(n,2k',k'-1)$ with $k' \geq 3$ ? Can it be exactly determined in any cases? Some related questions and results are mentioned below. In the case $k'=2$ , this boils down to evaluating $m(n,4,1)$ which is equivalent to the $K_4$ -packing number of $K_n$ . This was determined exactly in the paper 'Optimal packing of $K_4$ 's into a $K_n$ ' by A.E Brouwer in 1979. As noted in this question which links to this paper , the general case is equivalent to finding a lower bound on the maximum number of binary codewords of length $n$ and weight $k$ such that the Hamming distance between any two codewords is at least $2k-r$ . Adapting the notation in the paper, I want a lower bound on $A(n,2k-r,k)$ . Theorems 4 and 7 do provide some lower bounds but it seems to me that the argument only works if $2k-r$ is even. Moreover, I am interested in the case $A(n,2k-r,k) = A(n,3k'+1,2k')$ and was wondering if you can somehow obtain stronger bounds in this case. (Note that in my case, the results from the paper seem to apply only if $3k'+1$ is even, or equivalently if $k'$ is odd). This question is also related and provides a nice lower bound attributed to Frenkl, but I could not find a reference to the original statement of this theorem despite some digging around.

55,Generalizing the Binary Reflected Gray Code,Generalizing the Binary Reflected Gray Code,,"Let $Q_n$ denote the $n$ -dimensional hypercube. It has a vertex for each binary string $x = x_n x_{n-1} \ldots x_1 \in \{0, 1\}^n$ , and there is an edge between two vertices $v_x$ and $v_y$ if their corresponding binary strings $x$ and $y$ have Hamming distance one. For convenience, we will use $x$ to denote $v_x$ when the context is clear. An $n$ -bit gray code is a cyclic ordering of all $n$ -bit binary strings such that consecutive strings in the code have Hamming distance one. Therefore, an $n$ -bit gray code corresponds to a Hamiltonian cycle in $Q_n$ . The Binary Reflected Gray Code (BRGC) is an example of such a code defined as follows, which we denote by $G_n$ . For $n = 1$ , $G_1$ is simply $[0; 1]$ . For $n > 1$ is can be defined recursively by $G_n = 0 \cdot [G_{n - 1}]; 1 \cdot [G_{n-1}]^R$ . In other words, $0 \cdot [G_{n - 1}]$ denotes the elements of $G_{n-1}$ prefixed by a $0$ and $1 \cdot [G_{n-1}]^R$ denotes the elements in $G_{n-1}$ , in reversed order, prefixed by a $1$ . The BRGC has two useful properties. Let $G_n = [g_0; g_1; \ldots; g_{2^n - 1};]$ denote the elements of $G_n$ . Bit $x_1$ is flipped every other time. For odd $i$ , $0 \leq i \leq 2^n - 1$ , define the pairs $P_{\lfloor \frac{i}{2} \rfloor} = (g_i, g_{i + 1 \mod 2^n})$ . The elements of $Q_n$ can be partitioned into $2^{n-2}$ pairwise disjoint copies of $Q_2$ (isomorphic to $Q_2$ ), where each copy of $Q_2$ corresponds to two of the above pairs, which we denote by $S = (s_1, s_2)$ and $T = (t_1, t_2)$ , such that $s_1 \oplus s_2 = t_1 \oplus t_2$ (the exclusive-or operator). Note that since $s_1$ occurs immediately before $s_2$ and $t_1$ occurs immediately before $t_2$ in $G_n$ , then $s_1$ and $t_1$ have Hamming distance two. We can obtain such a partitioning as follows. The pairs $P_{2^{n-2} - 1}$ and $P_{2^{n-1} - 1}$ form one copy of $Q_2$ , as well as the pairs $P_j$ and $P_{2^{n-1} - 2 - j}$ , for $0 \leq j < 2^{n-2}-1$ . Is it possible to find a gray code (possibly by generalizing the BRGC), that admits a similar partitioning, except into $2^{n-3}$ disjoint copies of $Q_3$ ? I worry that the first property might prevent the generalization, but haven't been able to prove so. If true, can something be said regarding a similar partitioning into $2^{n-d}$ disjoint copies of $Q_d$ ? Example for $n=4$ : The vertices are labelled from $g_0$ to $g_{15}$ , starting from the string of all zeros, denoting the order in the BRGC.

We are given a vector $x\in {\bf R}^d$ and $n$ other vectors $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ . All of these vectors have length at least $1$ . Now we consider all $2^n$ sums of the form $$\sum_{i=1}^n \epsilon_ix_i$$ where $\epsilon_i\in\{-1,1\}$ and the goal is to show that at most ${n\choose \lfloor n/2\rfloor}$ of these sums can be at a distance $\leq 1$ from $x$ . For $d=1$ , we can assume that all the $x_i$ are positive by multiplying by $-1$ if necessary. For $A\subseteq [n]$ , we let $$x_A = \sum_{i\in A} x_i - \sum_{i\notin A} x_i.$$ Let ${\cal F}$ be the set of all $A\subseteq [n]$ such that $|x_A - x| < 1$ . Let $A$ be a proper subset of $B\subseteq [n]$ and consider $|x_A - x| + |x_B-x|$ . By the triangle inequality, we have $$\eqalign{ |x_A - x| + |x_B - x|&\geq |x_B - x_A| \cr &= \Big| \sum_{i\in B} x_i -\sum_{i\in A}x_i + \sum_{i\notin A}x_i - \sum_{i\notin B} x_i\Big| \cr &= 2\Big|\sum_{i\in B\setminus A} x_i\Big|\cr &\geq 2 \Big(\sum_{i\in B\setminus A}x_i - \sum_{i\in B\setminus A} x_i \Big)\cr &= 2x_{B\setminus A}\cr &\geq 2. }$$ So one of $x_A$ and $x_B$ is not in ${\cal F}$ , meaning we can apply Sperner's theorem.

76,Correspondence between $k$-ary Lyndon words and $(k-1)$-ary Lyndon words without repetitions,Correspondence between -ary Lyndon words and -ary Lyndon words without repetitions,k (k-1),"At Counting Lyndon words with no adjacent character repeats , it turned out that for $n\ge3$ the number of $k$ -ary Lyndon words of length $n$ without adjacent identical letters is the number of $(k-1)$ -ary Lyndon words of length $n$ . I suspect there should be an elegant combinatorial proof of this. Without the aperiodicity constraint of the Lyndon words, the number of circular arrangements of $n$ letters from an alphabet of size $k$ without adjacent identical letters is $$ (k-1)^n+(-1)^n(k-1)\;. $$ It’s not surprising that this is roughly $(k-1)^n$ , since as you go around the circle, you can choose each letter freely except it can’t be the same as the previous one. What is surprising (to me), though, is that the boundary effect when you get back to the origin doesn’t quite cancel for unconstrained circular arrangements (leaving the term $(-1)^n(k-1)$ ), but does cancel exactly for aperiodic ones. In the algebraic derivation of the result, this happens because the Dirichlet convolution of $(-1)^n$ with the Möbius function is zero except at $n=2$ ; but I don’t know what that corresponds to combinatorially. One idea I had was to use the fact that a Lyndon word is lexicographically minimal among its rotations, which means that an aperiodic Lyndon word can’t start and end with the same letter (since otherwise you could rotate the last letter to the front, contradicting minimality). This could somehow make the boundary condition work out right when you look at the choices letter by letter. Another approach I tried was to treat the letters as residues modulo $k$ and consider the differences between neighbours instead of the values themselves. Then the constraint is that no difference must be $0$ , and the differences must add up to $0$ . Each admissible arrangement of differences corresponds to $k$ arrangements of letters. But I don’t see how to make that work, either. My questions are: Is there a natural bijection between the $k$ -ary Lyndon words of length $n$ without adjacent identical letters and the $(k-1)$ -ary Lyndon words of length $n$ ?

In order from top to bottom let the numbers of squares in the top $k+1$ rows be $$a,a+e_1,a+e_1+e_2, ... , a+e_1+e_2+...+e_k=c.$$ In order from bottom to top let the numbers of squares in the bottom $l+1$ rows be $$b,b+f_1,b+f_1+f_2, ... , b+f_1+f_2+...+f_l=c.$$ It would need proving, but it does seem self-evident that each $e_i$ and $f_i$ is non-negative because, if not, we could adjust the arrangement to enclose at least no fewer white squares. Each white square has 4 boundary edges which must join it to either another white square or a black square. The two ends of each row require $2(k+l+1)$ black squares. Now consider, say, the third row which contains $a+e_1+e_2$ squares. Its upper edges will need to be joined to $e_2$ black squares at most two of which could already have been counted at the ends of the second row. Furthermore, if $e_2>2,$ then an extra white square can be put at one or other end of the second row without requiring any extra black squares. In general, we can suppose that all of $a,b,e_i,f_i$ are at most $2$ . The total number of black squares which are required is therefore $$2(k+l+1)+a+b.$$ Without loss of generality suppose that $a+2k\ge b+2l$ . As we have seen, without increasing the number of black squares, the numbers of squares in the rows can be increased (or at least kept the same) to $$a,a+2,a+4, ... , a+2k,a+2k-2, ..., a+2(k-l).$$ Also, as noted earlier we could increase the number of white squares if either $a$ or $b$ was greater than 2. We can therefore suppose $a=b$ is either $1$ or $2$ and so $k=l$ . For $4n$ black squares we now have the type of arrangement noted by @MikeEarnest. $a=b=1$ and $n=k+1$ . The number of white squares is $n^2+(n-1)^2=2n^2-2n+1$ .

But the implied meaning of 'trivial' solutions in other posts seems unsatisfactory -- I think I can convince you. There appear to be exactly $4$ non-trivial solutions after adjusting our vocabulary. One of which is the previous equation. I'm curious; are their any other non-trivial solutions? $\bullet\ \textbf{Triviality}$ Firstly, let's use the notation $a^{(b)}=\prod_{k=0}^{b-1}(a+k)$ to denote rising factorial. The previous equation then becomes $8^{(7)}=63^{(4)}$ . All solutions come in pairs -- one overlapping and one disjoint. For example, if we take the solution $$2^{(5)}=2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot5\cdot6=8\cdot9\cdot10=8^{(3)},$$ which we will call disjoint because no integer appears on both sides, we can create an overlapping solution multiplying both sides by $7$ : $$2^{(6)}=2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot5\cdot6\cdot\textbf{7}=\textbf{7}\cdot8\cdot9\cdot10=7^{(4)}.$$ This duality means that boring solutions like $2^{(2)}=2\cdot3=6^{(1)}$ can be disguised as interesting by transforming them from disjoint to overlapping: $$2^{(2)}=6^{(1)}\quad\rightarrow\quad 2^{(4)}=4^{(3)}.$$ For example, two answers on a previous post gave $3^{(9)}=5^{(8)}$ as an ""interesting"" solution. But this is simply the overlapping dual of $3\cdot 4 = 12$ . In general, if $a^{(b)}=c^{(d)}$ is a solution, then so is its dual: $$a^{(c-a)}=(a+b)^{(c+d-a-b)}.$$ So here we define a trivial solution either 1) having overlap or 2) having only one term on one side (previous inquiries seemed to only have considered #2). $\bullet\ \textbf{Non-trivial Solutions}$ There are $4$ known non-trivial solutions under this definition: $$2^{(5)}=8^{(3)},\quad 5^{(3)}=14^{(2)},\quad 19^{(4)}=55^{(3)},\quad\text{and}\quad 8^{(7)}=63^{(4)}.$$ I ran a computer search on equivalent $a^{(b)}$ for $a<100,000$ and $b<50$ and found nothing new ( https://repl.it/@onnomc/EqualProductsOfConsecutiveIntegers ). $\bullet\ \textbf{Proof Attempts}$ One attempt is to note $a^{(b)}=\frac{(a+b-1)!}{(a-1)!}$ and that therefore solutions to $a^{(b)}=c^{(d)}$ are also solutions to $A!B!=C!D!$ . But apparently even $A!B!=C!$ has not yet been solved ( On the factorial equations $A! B! =C!$ and $A!B!C! = D!$ ). I thought also to use Stirling's approximation since $$(a+1)^{(b)}=\frac{(a+b)!}{a!}\approx \Big(\frac{a+b}{a}\Big)^{a+1/2}\Big(\frac{a+b}{e}\Big)^b$$ and ... well, hope for the best. I made no progress here. I tried also bounding the number of distinct primes dividing $a^{(b)}$ . We can bound $c$ from below since $$a^b<a^{(b)}=c^{(d)}<(c+d-1)^d\quad\Rightarrow\quad c>a^{b/d}-d+1.$$ And of course, the non-overlapping criteria gives $c\ge a+b$ . Thus if the prime bound rises fast enough, we can show that we are trying to fit too many prime divisors into $c(c+1)...(c+d-1)$ . The furthest I got down this trail was finding $r$ consecutive integers with a product divisible by at most $r$ primes. For example, the largest solution for $r=5$ is $c=24$ since $$24\cdot25\cdot26\cdot27\cdot28=2^6\cdot3^4\cdot5^2\cdot7\cdot13.$$ The largest solution for $r=42$ seems to be $c=2175$ . But I cannot prove these are the largest such integers -- only that they appear so empirically ( https://repl.it/@onnomc/ConsecutiveIntegersOfFewPrimes ). Interestingly, the case $r=2$ yields $c=+\infty$ if there are infinitely many Mersenne primes.","One can find equivalent products of consecutive integers such as Other solutions of this have been posted already ( Equal products of consecutive integers ).

Are there similar problems with results that can provide insight into this problem? To clarify the base construction We can prove first $2^n-1$ numbers can always be constructed inductively. Assume this is true: The $2^n-1$ is simply the sum of the powers. The last step is obtainable. The $2^{n-1}$ is the last term, and previous case $(n-1)$ can by assumption build all numbers from $1$ to $2^{n-1}-1$ . Summing these terms gives us all numbers from $2^{n-1}$ to $2^n-1$ . Repeat this for $(n-2)$ and so on until you reach the base case $1$ . From $n,\dots,1$ we reached the base case $\{1\}$ which trivially builds $1$ . We can build all numbers from $1$ to $2^n-1$ which was shown inductively. This means $f(n)\ge 2^n$ for $n\ge 1$ . Notice we haven't used division yet. Extending the construction We ca now try to extend the construction: Let $d=2^{n-1}$ largest power. For $n\ge3$ , we can show we can obtain the $3$ extra terms: $d\cdot 2 \cdot 1,\space  d\cdot 2 + 1,\space  (d + 1)\cdot 2$ So we have: $f(n)\ge 2^n+3,n\ge 3$ , and for this case $f(3)=11$ . For $n\ge4$ , we can show we can obtain the $8$ extra terms: $d\cdot 2 +  (4-1),\space d\cdot 2 +  (4\cdot1),\space  d\cdot 2 +  (4+1),\space   (d +1)\cdot 2 +  4$ , $\space  (d +4)\cdot 2 -1,\space  (d +4)\cdot 2 \cdot1,\space  (d +4)\cdot 2 +1,\space  (d +4+1)\cdot 2$ , So we have: $f(n)\ge 2^n+11,n\ge 4$ , and for this case $f(4)=27$ . And so on, for $f(5),f(6),\dots$ we can construct $34,488,\dots$ extra terms. But I do not see a pattern for generally extending $n$ to $n+1$ . Use of division $(\div)$ Also note that these first five values of $f(n)$ can be obtained without the use of division. And the $f(6)$ would be $595$ if division is not allowed, but with division allowed it is $597$ , so after $n\ge 6$ , the division is significant. That is, $595$ has only one representation possible (ignoring permutations of it): $$ 595 = (1 + 16 + 4/8 )\times(2 + 32)  $$ Numbers usually tend to have multiple representations.

For each row or column, consider the number of distinct numbers in   it. I feel like double counting is involved in the process, but what to count in two different ways? Also I can prove the statement with the probabilistic method but I would really like to learn the double counting approach. Here is the other proof: Choose a random row or column ( $2n$ choices). Let $\textbf X$ be the number of distinct entries in it. Use the indicator variable $I_i$ , for the existence of number $i$ in the block: $\textbf X = \sum I_i.$ Clearly, $E[I_i] = P[I_i = 1]$ .

Please find all the triples for which: $$\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}=1,$$ using the pigeon hole principle.

99,Counting the Number of Lattice Points in an $n$-Dimensional Sphere,Counting the Number of Lattice Points in an -Dimensional Sphere,n,"Let $S_n(R)$ denote the number of lattice points in an $n$ -dimensional ""sphere"" with radius $R$ . For clarification, I am interested in lattice points found both strictly inside the sphere, and on its surface. I want to count exactly how many such points there are. This count corresponds to the amount of sets of integers that are solutions to the equation $$a_1^2+a_2^2+a_3^2+...+a_{n-1}^2+a_n^2= R^2$$ where the $a_i$ 's are required to be integers, not necessarily positive, and sets that differ just by the order of the summands are also considered distinct , i.e for the case $n=3, R=5$ , the following are both counted: $3^2+(-4)^2+0^2$ and $(-4)^2+0^2+3^2$ . This can also be interpreted as the sum of squares function - $r_d(k)$ denotes in how many such ways I can write $k$ as the sum of $d$ squares. This means that $$S_n(R) = \sum_{k=1}^{R^2}r_n(k)$$ I am asking this question as a general one, but I am mostly concerned about the cases of $n=2, n=3,n=4$ . In order not to be too lengthy and remain focused, I won't explain why but summing this way requires to factor each $k$ first. This is very time consuming, so I searched for better ways. For the case of $n=2$ , which is essentially just the count of lattice points in a circle of radius $R$ , I have managed to find that $$S_2(R)= 1+\sum_{i=1}^\infty\biggl(\biggl \lfloor\frac{R^2}{4i+1}\biggl \rfloor-\biggl \lfloor\frac{R^2}{4i+3}\biggl \rfloor\biggl )$$ For the case of $n=4$ , I found: $$S_4(R)= 1+8\sum_{k=1}^{R^2}\sum_{d|k \atop {4\nmid d}}d$$ Unfortunately, for the case of a sphere ( $n=3$ ), I have found no formula, neither for the count of lattice points inside nor on the surface of the sphere. Although these formulas do indeed provide the exact count of lattice points, they are very slow in computational terms, as their running time complexity is $O(R^2)$ . I was wondering if a more efficient way exists to count the number of such lattice points, perhaps $O(R)$ or $O(R^{1/2+\epsilon})$ , so that I can work with radii as big as $10^9$ or even more. I suspect there is a way, but I can't find it. Not necessarily a different approach to the problem, but rather just a more clever way to reduce the order of the sum. Also, any insight about $S_3(R)$ will be appreciated.","Let denote the number of lattice points in an -dimensional ""sphere"" with radius .
