1,Why are there nine regular polyhedra?,Why are there nine regular polyhedra?,,"Context for question: The study of polyhedra and more generally of polytopes has never been particularly focused on rigor, and many references for results are often either non-existent, or impossible to find. This lead me to try to prove some basic results on polyhedra. To be clear, the definition of polyhedra I use is a set of polygonal faces and edges such that two faces are adjacent to each edge, no two elements coincide and such that no subset of faces and edges forms a valid polyhedron (this excludes compounds). The problem with answering the question: With this in mind, I can now use the common definition of a regular polyhedron as a vertex-transitive polyhedron with congruent, regular faces. However, I ran into a problem when trying to prove that there were only 5 convex and 4 non-convex types (Platonic and Kepler-Poinsot solids): First of all, the common proof for the Platonic solids (the one that uses the fact that you can't have many shapes with many sides around a vertex) assumes too many things. For example, one first needs to prove that the sum of the angles around a vertex is less than $2\pi$, which is false in the general, not-necessarily-convex case. Also, one needs to prove that given a vertex arrangement, there's at most one regular polyhedron that can be made. And even with all of this, the argument can't be generalized to non-convex solids: One can fit perfectly 7 equilateral triangles around a vertex, if you allow them to intersect. So, why are there only 9 regular types of polyhedra? [EDIT #1] Using Arentino's answer, I can immediately characterize the convex cases. If I could prove that the convex hull of any regular solid is regular, I could easily just check for polygons on the vertices of these five solids and check how to connect them to create the other four cases. However, I don't know why should this be the case either, and I have no idea of how to prove it. [EDIT #2] Assuming all ""known"" properties of convex hulls (they are polyhedra for finite sets of points, etc.), I have been able to prove that the convex hulls have to be vertex-transitive (any symmetry of the original polyhedron that takes vertex A to B, will preserve the positions of the vertices as a whole and therefore the convex hull. As a consequence, the vertex figures are all congruent. However, I still need to prove that the faces are all congruent and regular, and I don't know how to do this. (Yet again). [EDIT #3] At last, some useful literature! I found the following book (p. 260) where it describes why every Kepler-Poinsot solid must be a stellation of a regular polyhedron. (Although if someone can prove the thing about convex hills, I'd appreciate it deeply). There's just a tiny problem. I don't understand the proof completely.

4,Quadrilateral Interpolation,Quadrilateral Interpolation,,"The simplest finite element shape in two dimensions is a triangle . In a finite element context, any geometrical shape is endowed with an interpolation , which is linear for triangles (most of the time), as has been explained in this answer : $$ T(x,y) = A.x + B.y + C $$ Here $A$ and $B$ can be expressed in coordinate and function values at the vertices (nodal points) of the triangle: $$ \begin{cases}  A = [ (y_3 - y_1).(T_2 - T_1) - (y_2 - y_1).(T_3 - T_1) ] / \Delta  \\  B = [ (x_2 - x_1).(T_3 - T_1) - (x_3 - x_1).(T_2 - T_1) ] / \Delta \end{cases} \\ \Delta = (x_2 - x_1).(y_3 - y_1) - (x_3 - x_1).(y_2 - y_1) $$ Consider the simplest finite element shape in two dimensions except one: the quadrilateral . Function behavior inside a quadrilateral is approximated by a bilinear interpolation between the function values at the vertices or nodal points (most of the time. Wikipedia is rather terse about it) Let $T$ be such a function, and $x,y$ coordinates. Then try: $$        T = A + B.x + C.y + D.x.y $$ Giving: $$ \begin{cases} T_1 = A + B.x_1 + C.y_1 + D.x_1.y_1 \\ T_2 = A + B.x_2 + C.y_2 + D.x_2.y_2 \\ T_3 = A + B.x_3 + C.y_3 + D.x_3.y_3 \\  T_4 = A + B.x_4 + C.y_4 + D.x_4.y_4 \end{cases} \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad  \begin{bmatrix} T_1 \\ T_2 \\ T_3 \\ T_4 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & x_1 & y_1 & x_1 y_1 \\ 1 & x_2 & y_2 & x_2 y_2 \\ 1 & x_3 & y_3 & x_3 y_3 \\ 1 & x_4 & y_4 & x_4 y_4 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} A \\ B \\ C \\ D \end{bmatrix} \\ \Longleftrightarrow \quad \begin{bmatrix} A \\ B \\ C \\ D \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & x_1 & y_1 & x_1 y_1 \\ 1 & x_2 & y_2 & x_2 y_2 \\ 1 & x_3 & y_3 & x_3 y_3 \\ 1 & x_4 & y_4 & x_4 y_4 \end{bmatrix}^{-1} \begin{bmatrix} T_1 \\ T_2 \\ T_3 \\ T_4 \end{bmatrix} $$ Provided that we have a non-singular matrix in the middle. But now we have a little problem. Consider the quadrilateral as depicted in the above picture on the right. The vertex-coordinates of this quadrilateral are defined by the second and the third column of the matrix below. This matrix is formed by specifying $T$ vertically for the nodal points and horizontally for the basic functions $ 1,x,y,xy $ : $$  \begin{bmatrix} T_1 \\ T_2 \\ T_3 \\ T_4   \end{bmatrix} =  \begin{bmatrix}  1  &  -\frac{1}{2}  &   0  &  0  \\                   1  &   0  &  -\frac{1}{2}  &  0  \\                   1  &  +\frac{1}{2}  &   0  &  0  \\                   1  &   0  &  +\frac{1}{2}  &  0  \end{bmatrix}  \begin{bmatrix} A \\ B \\ C \\ D \end{bmatrix} $$ The last column of the matrix is zero. Hence it is singular , meaning that $A,B,C$ and $D$ cannot be found in this manner. Though with a unstructured grid there may seem to be not a great chance that a quadrilateral is exactly positioned like this, experience reveals that it cannot be excluded that Murphy comes by. That alone is enough reason to declare the method for triangles not done for quadrilaterals. Two questions: Why in the first place would a bilinear interpolation be associated with a quadrilateral ? Why not some other finite element shape? And why not some other interpolation? How can a bilinear interpolation be defined for an arbitrary quadrilateral (assumed convex ), i.e. without running into singularities? My problem is not so much how the quadrilateral and the bilinear are related but rather why they are related in this way. I shall be satisfied with a response when it has become more clear that there are no other possibilities i.e. people haven't overlooked anything. EDIT. The comment by Rahul sheds some light. Let the finite element shape be ""modified"" by an affine transformation (with $a,b,c,d,p,q$ arbitrary real constants) and work out for the term that is interesting: $$\begin{cases} x' = ax+by+p \\ y' = cx+dy+q \end{cases} \quad \Longrightarrow \\ x'y'=acx^2+bdy^2 + (ad+bc)xy+(cp+aq)x+(dp+bq)y+pq $$ So the interpolation remains bilinear only when the following conditions are fulfilled: $$ ac=0 \; \wedge \; bd=0 \; \wedge \; ad+bc\ne 0 \quad \Longleftrightarrow \\ \begin{cases} a\ne 0  \; \wedge \; d\ne 0 \; \wedge \; b=0 \; \wedge \; c=0 \\ a=0  \; \wedge \; d=0 \; \wedge \; b\ne 0 \; \wedge \; c\ne 0 \end{cases}\quad \Longleftrightarrow \\ \begin{cases}x'=ax+p\\y'=dy+q\end{cases} \quad \vee \quad \begin{cases}x'=by+p\\y'=cx+q\end{cases} $$ This means that a (parent) quadrilateral element, once it has been chosen, can only be translated, scaled (in $x$- and/or $y$- direction), mirrored in $\,y=\pm x$ , rotated over $90^o$. Did I forget something? Update. Why a quadrilateral with bilinear interpolation? Little else is possible with polynomial terms like $\;1,\xi,\eta,\xi\eta\,$ , if four nodal points are needed (one degree of freedom each) for obtaining four equations with four unknowns. Then stil there remain some issues, such as not self-intersecting and being convex. The former issue has been covered in the answer by Nominal Animal. The latter may be stuff for a separate question. Other issues covered in the answer by Nominal Animal are the following. Perhaps the simplest heuristics is to take the direct product of one-dimensional case: the line segment as well as the linear interpolation. With the notations by Rahul and Nominal Animal that is: $[0,1]\times[0,1]$ and $\{1,u\}\times\{1,v\}$ . In the end, we have a square as the standard parent bilinear quadrilateral. For a non-degenerate paralellogram the bilinear interpolation is reduced to a linear one, which makes it simple to express the local coordinates $(u,v)$ into the global coordinates $(x,y)$.

Now, It's been ages since he asked me the question, and he himself seems to have forgotten the solution, so here's the question for the community(I tried searching, but useless): Two friends go to a pizza shop and purchase one. They decide to make 8 slices of the pizza. Then the waiter comes and challenges them to cut the pizza such that the point where all cutting lines meet is NOT the centre of the pizza, but another point. The friends are jolts of each other and think that one of them will get a bigger area f pizza is this method is used. To satisfy both of them, the waiter himself cuts it in such a way that both get 4 slices, and there cumulative area is equal. How did the waiter do this ? So, basically, you have to draw chords across the circle such that all of them intersect at a certain point(thats not the center) and then choose 4 pieces equal in area to the other 4. My friend claims that if we divide the circle as in the image below: IN this way, or basically any way, the following property holds: ar(1) + ar(3) + ar(5) + ar(7) = ar(2) + ar(4) + ar(6) + ar(8) Hence, the two friends can distribute the pizza amongst themselves.

Let me start out by saying that I had prepared a couple of images to help explain all this, but I'm not allowed to use them in this post as I'm a new user. Hence, some references to graphs are less meaningful. I have tried to describe what the graphs depicted. I have a path of a known distance, that must be traversed in a fixed amount of time. However, I must start the traversal of the path and end the traversal at a specific speed. So, for example, if I need to traverse 1200 feet in 10 seconds, and my entry & exit speeds must both be 120 ft./sec, then I can simply stay at the constant speed of 120 ft./second to accomplish my goal. If I graph speed against time, the area under the graph represents distance traveled as so: (Figure 1 shows speed in the vertical axis, time in the horizontal axis, with points marked for 120 ft./sec. on the vertical and 10 seconds on the horizontal. It shows a rectangular area under the horizontal line at Speed 120 ft/sec. starting a 0 seconds and going until 10 seconds. The area shown represents the 1200 feet that would be traversed). However, if I have to travel only 700 feet in that same 10 second interval, things get ugly. I thought about decelerating at a constant rate until I could then accelerate at a constant rate to end up with my speed curve carving a triangle out of the graph in Figure 1 above, whose area above the curve would be 500 ft. However that would yield a discontinuity in the acceleration/deceleration that is unacceptable. I then figured I could use a segment of a circle to do the same thing as shown below: (Cool image shows a similar graph to the one above, but with a segment of a circle cutting into the shaded area from the image above, such that the segment intersects horizontal line at time = 0 and speed = 120 ft/sec on one side and 120 ft./sec and 10 seconds on the other side, with the segment dipping down to carve out 500 ""feet"" from the area under the horizontal line representing a constant speed of 120 ft/sec) Here the orange area would represent the 500 ft less than the distance traveled by a constant speed. Following the speed curve indicated by the circle segment should be pretty trivial. And so it would seem that I have solved my problem. However, when I try to actually implement this into an algorithm, I run into the problem that the area calculations for the segment of a circle doesn't seem to yield units that make any sense. Perhaps it would be better to say that I don't know how to set up the problem so that the units make sense. Sure I can calculate the area of the segment, but what does 10 seconds mean when used as the chord of the circle, and what should the units of the radius be. I guess the value of theta is still easy at least. ;) Unfortunately I'm sort of stumped on the rest. I'm not even sure that this approach is viable.

40,Can a triangle up to isometry shatter seven points?,Can a triangle up to isometry shatter seven points?,,"From Wikipedia : The class [of sets] $C$ shatters the set $A$ if for each subset $a$ of $A$ , there is some element $c \in C$ such that $a = c\cap A$ . In other words, $C$ shatters $A$ if for every subset $S\subset A$ , it's possible to find  a set $c\in C$ which covers the points in $S$ but none of the points in $A\setminus S$ . For instance, if $C$ is the set of closed half-planes, then $C$ shatters any non-colinear set of three points, but does not shatter a unit square, because it isn't possible to cover one diagonal while omitting the other. Given a triangle $T$ , let $C$ be the set of all isometric copies of $T$ - all translations, rotations, and reflections of $T$ in the plane, not permitting scaling. What is the maximum size of a set $A$ such that for some triangle $T$ , $C(T)$ shatters $A$ ? It's possible to attain $|A|=6$ by taking $A$ to be the vertices of a regular hexagon of unit side length and $T$ to be an isosceles triangle with side lengths $(2.8,4.48797,4.48797)$ . Below are diagrams of every configuration up to dihedral symmetry: On the other hand, it's impossible to have $|A|=8$ . Note that every point of $A$ must lie on a vertex of its convex hull, or else taking $S$ to be the convex hull would prove impossible (since a triangle is convex). So $A$ must be the vertices of a convex polygon. But then take $S$ to be an alternating set of four points around the perimeter of $A$ : this forces a side of our triangle to lie in four different places, none of which are compatible, which is a contradiction since we only have three sides available. (To see that the side restrictions are incompatible, observe that the permissible oriented angles enforced by each region are disjoint intervals.) This only leaves the case $|A|=7$ . Is it possible? I've tried some approaches where $A$ is a regular heptagon, and wasn't able to find something that worked, but I'm not confident I've ruled out even that case (I think an isosceles $T$ at least is not possible with such an $A$ ).","From Wikipedia : The class [of sets] shatters the set if for each subset of , there is some element such that .

Use the five $(x,y)$ points to solve the conic equation $$ax^2+by^2+cxy+dx+ey+f=0$$ for the coefficients $a, b, c, d, e, f$ using some algorithm for solving linear system of equations (hopefully stable with floating-point numbers) . Check the coefficients to make sure they represent an ellipse, and not another type of conic. Calculate the ellipse properties from the coefficients ( formulae ) .

I have had some success calculating the largest hexagonal wrench that can fit on a square drive, but it came out very large and I remember that it was not this large of a tool when I worked in the field. The problem is that when you add this extra point in a hexagon making it a decagon, it allows the square to rotate. The square drive is d=.750 and I came out with x=(sqrt(5)/(3-sqrt(3))d, where x is the width across two sides of a hexagon. The proof of the hexagon starts with the fact that the largest square inside of a hexagon shares the same center. Its a strange proof that I dont understand, but it can be found here: http://www.drking.org.uk/hexagons/misc/deriv3.html . This web page gives us the result that (1) d=(3-sqrt(3))a. Then I derived (2) a=x/sqrt(5) using the Pythagorean therom. From there, I substituted (2) into (1). and got the result x~1.764d, x~1.323 when d=.750. I know this cant be right. I could calculate the diagonals of the square drive and set that equal to the diagonals of the dodecagon. From there I could probably find the distance between two sides of the dodecagon and that would be a starting point, but I'd rather find a relation and proof for largest square inside a dodecagon that cannot rotate.

76,Why is the height of a pentagonal antiprism equal to the circumradius of the base?,Why is the height of a pentagonal antiprism equal to the circumradius of the base?,,"It is a fact (that one can verify, for example, by plugging in n=5 into the formulae on the Wolfram Mathworld page on antiprisms) that the height of a (regular) pentagonal antiprism (i.e., the pentagonal antiprism with all edges the same length and top and bottom faces regular pentagons) is equal to the circumradius of its base.  Does anyone know a (relatively) short proof of this fact that lends some nice insight into why this equality occurs?  That reveals it as something more essential than a coincidence about the trigonometric functions of angles like $\pi/5$? I have the intuition that the fact that if you augment the pentagonal antiprism with two pentagonal bipyramids you get a regular icosahedron ought to provide a quick proof of the antiprism height = base circumradius equality, but I have been unable to crystallize this intuition into a short, elegant proof.  Thanks for any insight you can provide. To elaborate somewhat, the nicest/most direct proof I know of this equality is as follows.  We first derive the exact value of the circumradius $r$ of the regular pentagon with edge-length 1 (details below); it turns out to be $r=\sqrt{\frac{5+\sqrt{5}}{10}}$. From this, the height $p$ of the equilateral pentagonal pyramid with edge-length 1 is $p = \sqrt{1-r^2} = \sqrt{\frac{5-\sqrt{5}}{10}}$. Now consider the regular icosahedron with side length 1, with one vertex at the ""north pole"" of its circumscribed sphere of radius $R$. The plane $P$ through the five vertices nearest to (but not at) the north pole cuts the icosahedron in a regular pentagon which is the top base of a pentagonal antiprism of height $h$, as well as the base of a pentagonal pyramid with apex at the north pole.  Considering the radius of the sphere from its center to the north pole, it is cut into two pieces by $P$, of lengths $h/2$ and $p$, respectively. That is, $R = h/2 + p$. On the other hand, considering the radius from the center of the sphere to one of the vertices in plane $P$, we get a right triangle with hypotenuse $R$ and legs $h/2$ and $r$.  Hence, $R^2 = (h/2)^2 + r^2$. Squaring the first equation, equating the right hand sides, and solving for $h$ yields $$h = \frac{r^2-p^2}{p} = \frac{\frac{2\sqrt{5}}{10}}{\sqrt{\frac{5-\sqrt{5}}{10}}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{5-\sqrt{5}}} = \sqrt{\frac{5+\sqrt{5}}{10}} = r.$$ Does anyone know or can anyone find a more insightful/less computational proof of this equality? And here's the most elementary way I know of deriving $r$.  I presume the usual well-known occurrences of the golden ratio as in this diagram: Evidently from the diagram, $r^2 = a^2+\frac{1}{4}$  and $\frac{1}{\phi^2} = (a-\frac{r}{\phi^2})^2 + \frac{1}{4}$. Expanding the latter equation, substituting the first, and clearing denominators yields $r^2(\phi^4 + 1) - 2\phi^2ar = \phi^2$. Moving the remaining term with $a$ to the right, squaring, and and substituting from the first equation again yields $r^4(\phi^4+1)^2 - 2r^2\phi^2(\phi^4+1) + \phi^4 = 4\phi^4(r^2-\frac{1}{4})r^2$. Collecting powers of $r$ gives us $r^4(\phi^8 - 2\phi^4+1) + r^2(-2\phi^6 + \phi^4 - 2\phi^2) + \phi^4 = 0$. Substituting the value of $\phi$ yields, with some calculation, $r^4\left(\frac{35+15\sqrt{5}}{2}\right) + r^2\left(\frac{-35-15\sqrt{5}}{2}\right) + \frac{7+3\sqrt{5}}{2} = 0,$ and dividing by the constant term produces the seemingly miraculous simplification $5r^4 - 5r^2 +1 = 0$, whence $r^2 = \frac{5\pm\sqrt{5}}{10}$. Examination of the magnitudes of the two roots then makes it clear that $r = \sqrt{\frac{5+\sqrt{5}}{10}}$.  A less computational demonstration of the value of $r$ would be welcome also.","It is a fact (that one can verify, for example, by plugging in n=5 into the formulae on the Wolfram Mathworld page on antiprisms) that the height of a (regular) pentagonal antiprism (i.e., the pentagonal antiprism with all edges the same length and top and bottom faces regular pentagons) is equal to the circumradius of its base.  Does anyone know a (relatively) short proof of this fact that lends some nice insight into why this equality occurs?  That reveals it as something more essential than a coincidence about the trigonometric functions of angles like $\pi/5$? I have the intuition that the fact that if you augment the pentagonal antiprism with two pentagonal bipyramids you get a regular icosahedron ought to provide a quick proof of the antiprism height = base circumradius equality, but I have been unable to crystallize this intuition into a short, elegant proof.  Thanks for any insight you can provide. To elaborate somewhat, the nicest/most direct proof I know of this equality is as follows.  We first derive the exact value of the circumradius $r$ of the regular pentagon with edge-length 1 (details below); it turns out to be $r=\sqrt{\frac{5+\sqrt{5}}{10}}$. From this, the height $p$ of the equilateral pentagonal pyramid with edge-length 1 is $p = \sqrt{1-r^2} = \sqrt{\frac{5-\sqrt{5}}{10}}$. Now consider the regular icosahedron with side length 1, with one vertex at the ""north pole"" of its circumscribed sphere of radius $R$. The plane $P$ through the five vertices nearest to (but not at) the north pole cuts the icosahedron in a regular pentagon which is the top base of a pentagonal antiprism of height $h$, as well as the base of a pentagonal pyramid with apex at the north pole.  Considering the radius of the sphere from its center to the north pole, it is cut into two pieces by $P$, of lengths $h/2$ and $p$, respectively. That is, $R = h/2 + p$. On the other hand, considering the radius from the center of the sphere to one of the vertices in plane $P$, we get a right triangle with hypotenuse $R$ and legs $h/2$ and $r$.  Hence, $R^2 = (h/2)^2 + r^2$. Squaring the first equation, equating the right hand sides, and solving for $h$ yields $$h = \frac{r^2-p^2}{p} = \frac{\frac{2\sqrt{5}}{10}}{\sqrt{\frac{5-\sqrt{5}}{10}}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{5-\sqrt{5}}} = \sqrt{\frac{5+\sqrt{5}}{10}} = r.$$ Does anyone know or can anyone find a more insightful/less computational proof of this equality?

Expanding the latter equation, substituting the first, and clearing denominators yields $r^2(\phi^4 + 1) - 2\phi^2ar = \phi^2$. Moving the remaining term with $a$ to the right, squaring, and and substituting from the first equation again yields $r^4(\phi^4+1)^2 - 2r^2\phi^2(\phi^4+1) + \phi^4 = 4\phi^4(r^2-\frac{1}{4})r^2$. Collecting powers of $r$ gives us $r^4(\phi^8 - 2\phi^4+1) + r^2(-2\phi^6 + \phi^4 - 2\phi^2) + \phi^4 = 0$. Substituting the value of $\phi$ yields, with some calculation, $r^4\left(\frac{35+15\sqrt{5}}{2}\right) + r^2\left(\frac{-35-15\sqrt{5}}{2}\right) + \frac{7+3\sqrt{5}}{2} = 0,$ and dividing by the constant term produces the seemingly miraculous simplification $5r^4 - 5r^2 +1 = 0$, whence $r^2 = \frac{5\pm\sqrt{5}}{10}$.

Calculate the equations of the lines that connect the new vertexes with the opposite vertexes from the original triangle. I can do this because two point uniquely determine a line. Given the two line equations that I got in step 2, calculate the coordinates of the intersection of those lines. Am I missing something? The fact that I can't find a formula for this makes me think that I am, because, if what I'm trying to do is correct, why isn't there a direct formula? I mean, what I'm doing in each step is basically using a formula on what I got from the previous step, so why wouldn't there be a formula to go from step 0 (coordinates of the original triangle) to step 3 (coordinates of the Fermat point)? Furthermore, if there isn't a formula and if I'm not missing anything, is there a simpler way of doing what I'm trying to do?","I am aware of this question, but mine is a bit more specific. I want to find the coordinates of the Fermat point for a given triangle. Assuming that no angle in the triangle is larger than 120 degrees, there's an algorithm for doing that that goes something like this: Construct equilateral triangles on two sides of our given (original) triangle. Connect the new vertexes with the opposite vertexes from the original triangle. Find the point in which the connecting lines intersect - that's the Fermat point of our original triangle. (paraphrased from Wikipedia ) Now, I want to do this programmatically, so I can't do it by drawing.

To be fair, I'm not a math major and might just not be using the right search queries. I'm working on a system for outdoor WiFi localization. My experimental data suggests that using the RSSI (received signal strength) gives enough accuracy for the resolution we need, which is where the math - and you good folks - come in. I'd like to use trilateration to find a device's location, possibly using more than 3 beacons with known locations. With the variability of the RSSI at a given distance it is highly unlikely that trilateration will produce circles with a single common intersection. As such, I need to be able to calculate the point in 2D space that is closest to the edges of all 3+ circles. At the moment I am coding in python, if that makes a difference to anyone.
