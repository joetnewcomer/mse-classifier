5,"Studying the family of curves $\beta(s,r) = \alpha(s) + r\,{\bf N}(s)$",Studying the family of curves,"\beta(s,r) = \alpha(s) + r\,{\bf N}(s)","I'm reviewing some stuff on plane curves, just because, and I would like to confirm some things. The whole exercise is: Let $\alpha(s) = (x(s),y(s))$ be a unit-speed parametrized curve, ${\bf N}(s)$ its normal vector and $\kappa(s)$ its curvature. Consider the family of curves $\beta(s,r) = \alpha(s) +r\,{\bf N}(s)$, $-\epsilon \leq r \leq \epsilon$. Check that $\beta(s,r_0)$ and $\beta(s_0, r)$ are regular curves for $\epsilon > 0$ small enough, check that they're orthogonal and that the curvature $\overline{\kappa}$ of $\beta(s,r_0)$ is $\frac{\kappa}{1+r_0\kappa}$. A direct computation gives: $$\left\|\frac{\partial \beta}{\partial s}(s,r_0)\right\| = |1-r_0\kappa(s)|, \quad \left\|\frac{\partial \beta}{\partial r}(s_0, r)\right\| = 1,$$ so that $\beta(s_0, r)$ is always regular. My first problem is with the first curve. If $|\kappa(s)|$ attained a maximum, say, $|\kappa^\ast|$, then I can take $0 < \epsilon < 1/|\kappa^\ast|$ and from this $|1-r_0\kappa(s)| > 0$ for all $s$. The exercise was written sloppily and I should assume that $\alpha$ is defined in a closed interval, so that I can obtain this maximum $|\kappa^\ast|$? Or there's a trick around it? The second part is too easy, no problems. For the final part, I think that the formula given is wrong. Because $$\frac{\partial \beta}{\partial s}(s,r_0) = (1-r_0\kappa(s))\,{\bf T}(s), \quad \frac{\partial^2\beta}{\partial s^2}(s,r_0)= -r_0\kappa'(s)\,{\bf T}(s) + (1-r_0\kappa(s))\kappa(s)\,{\bf N}(s)$$will give: $$\det\left(\frac{\partial \beta}{\partial s}(s,r_0),\frac{\partial^2\beta}{\partial s^2}(s,r_0)\right) = (1-r_0\kappa(s))^2\kappa(s)$$ and so: $$\overline{\kappa}(s) = \frac{\kappa(s)}{|1-r_0\kappa(s)|}.$$ Did I miss anything?

Let $\Sigma$ be a complex curve in $\mathbb{C}^2$. If $\Sigma$ is transverse to a 3-sphere $S^3 \subset \mathbb{C}^2$ of radius $r$, then $\Sigma \cap S^3$ is a link, sometimes called a transverse $\mathbb{C}$-link . These include links of singularities and can shed light on the topology of $\Sigma$. Results of Rudolph and of Boileau-Orevkov show that the set of transverse $\mathbb{C}$-links is equal to the set of quasipositive links, which are defined in purely braid-theoretic terms. (For those interested, quasipositive braids are products of conjugates $w  \sigma_i w^{-1}$, where $w$ is any word in the braid group $B_n$ and $\sigma_i$ is a positive generator.) In particular, Boileau and Orevkov prove the following in this paper : Theorem. If a complex curve $\Sigma \subset \mathbb{C}^2$ intersects $S^3$ transversally, then $\Sigma \cap S^3$ is the closure of a quasipositive braid. To prove this, they show that a smooth piece $(\Sigma,\partial \Sigma)\subset (B^4,S^3)$ of a complex curve in $\mathbb{C}^2$ is an ascending surface (defined below), and then use properties of ascending surfaces to show that $\partial \Sigma$ is a quasipositive link.

Let $F$ be a smooth oriented surface properly embedded in the unit 4-ball $B^4 \subset \mathbb{C}^2$, assumed to miss the origin and be transverse to $\partial B^4 = S^3 \subset \mathbb{C}^2$.

Then $\rho\mid_F$ is Morse with a unique critical point at $(\tfrac{1}{2},0,0,0)$.

12,Dimensions of Grassmannians?,Dimensions of Grassmannians?,,"I'm trying to work out the dimensions of some examples of Grassmannians but I can't seem to do it.

19,Finding integral submanifold passing through the origin,Finding integral submanifold passing through the origin,,"I'm having a little trouble with this problem for Lee - Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2nd ed) . The problem is as follows (Problem 19-5): Let $D$ be the distribution of $\mathbb{R}^3$ spanned by   \begin{align*} X&=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}+yz\frac{\partial}{\partial z}, & Y&=\frac{\partial}{\partial y}. \end{align*} Find an integral submanifold of $D$ passing through the origin. Is $D$ involutive? Explain your answer in light of the first part. After thinking about the problem for a moment, I've determined that the surface $z=0$ (the $xy$-plane) fits the bill for the first question. But this seems too easy, so I'm naturally skeptical. Would it be beneficial to come up with a nontrivial example (if one exists)? I don't believe that $D$ is involutive, since $$ [X,Y]=X(1)\frac{\partial}{\partial y}-Y(1)\frac{\partial}{\partial x}-Y(yz)\frac{\partial}{\partial z}=-z\frac{\partial}{\partial z}, $$ and (I'm quite sure) $-z\,(\partial/\partial z)$ cannot be written as a linear combination of $X$ and $Y$, so $[X,Y]$ is not a local section of $D$, and hence it is not involutive.

Thank you.","I'm having a little trouble with this problem for Lee - Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2nd ed) . The problem is as follows (Problem 19-5): Let $D$ be the distribution of $\mathbb{R}^3$ spanned by   \begin{align*} X&=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}+yz\frac{\partial}{\partial z}, & Y&=\frac{\partial}{\partial y}. \end{align*} Find an integral submanifold of $D$ passing through the origin. Is $D$ involutive? Explain your answer in light of the first part. After thinking about the problem for a moment, I've determined that the surface $z=0$ (the $xy$-plane) fits the bill for the first question. But this seems too easy, so I'm naturally skeptical. Would it be beneficial to come up with a nontrivial example (if one exists)? I don't believe that $D$ is involutive, since $$ [X,Y]=X(1)\frac{\partial}{\partial y}-Y(1)\frac{\partial}{\partial x}-Y(yz)\frac{\partial}{\partial z}=-z\frac{\partial}{\partial z}, $$ and (I'm quite sure) $-z\,(\partial/\partial z)$ cannot be written as a linear combination of $X$ and $Y$, so $[X,Y]$ is not a local section of $D$, and hence it is not involutive.

The second term equals $[\eta + iJ\eta, \xi]f = ([\eta, \xi] + i J [\eta, \xi]) f$ which also vanishes since $[\eta, \xi] + i J [\eta, \xi]$ is also of type (0,1).",,"['differential-geometry', 'proof-verification', 'lie-groups', 'complex-geometry', 'several-complex-variables']"

49,Proof of the existence of a partition of unity,Proof of the existence of a partition of unity,,"I am trying to understand the proof that partitions of unity on a smooth manifold exist. To this end, I would like to post the proof in my own words here and kindly request that someone read it and tell me if it is correct. Thank you in advance for helping me learn. First I would like to give some definitions. A partition of unity on a $C^\infty$-$n$-manifold $M$ is a collection of smooth functions $\varphi_i : M \to \mathbb R$ such that $\varphi_i \ge 0$ and for all $m \in M$: $\sum_i \varphi_i(m) = 1$ and for only finitely many $i$: $\varphi_i (m) \neq 0$. We assume that a manifold is a second countable locally compact Hausdorff space and we use (without proof) that we can write such a space as a union of sets $G_i$ with the property that $\bigcup_i G_i = M$, $\overline{G_i}$ is compact and $\overline{G_i}\subseteq G_{i+1}$. I will also use that there exists a smooth map $\varphi: \mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R$ such that $\varphi$ is $1$ on the open cube of radius $1$ and $0$ outside the closed cube of radius $2$. Now the claim is: If $M$ is a smooth $n$-manifold and $U_i$ is an open cover of $M$ then there exists a partition of unity with compact support and $\mathrm{supp}(\varphi_i) $ contained in $U_i$. Here is the proof (how I understand it): Let $U_i$ be a given open cover of the smooth manifold $M$. Pick a point $m \in M$. Then $m \in U_i$ for some $i$. Let $(\psi, V)$ be any chart with $m \in V$. Then since scaling of a chart, translation of a chart and restriction of a chart to an open subset of $V$ yields again a chart we may assume that $\psi (m) = 0$ and that $\psi(V)$ contains the closed cube of radius $2$ and that $V \subseteq U_i \cap G_j \setminus \overline{G_{j-1}}$ where $j$ is the largest $j$ such that $m \notin \overline{G_j}$. Let $\widetilde{\varphi}: \mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R$ denote that map that is $1$ inside the open cube of radius $1$ centred at $0$ and $0$ outside the cube of radius $2$. Then we define a map $$ \varphi (m) = \begin{cases} 0 & m \notin V \\  \widetilde{\varphi} \circ \psi (m) & m \in V\end{cases}$$ Then it is clear that $\varphi$ is a smooth map $M \to \mathbb R$.

For $m \in \overline{G_i} \setminus G_{i-1}$ let $U_m$ denote an open neighbourhood on which the previously constructed map $\varphi$ is $1$. Then since $\overline{G_i} \setminus G_{i-1}$ is compact we may cover it with finitely many such neighbourhoods. We do this for every $i$ so as to obtain a sequence of smooth maps $\varphi_k$. Since the sum $\sum_k \varphi_k$ has only finitely many terms not equal to zero this sum converges at every point in $M$. Hence we may define $$ \varphi_k' = {\varphi_k \over \sum_k \varphi_k'}$$ It is clear that $\varphi_k'$ form a partition of unity for $M$ subordinate to the cover $U_i$.","I am trying to understand the proof that partitions of unity on a smooth manifold exist. To this end, I would like to post the proof in my own words here and kindly request that someone read it and tell me if it is correct. Thank you in advance for helping me learn. First I would like to give some definitions. A partition of unity on a $C^\infty$-$n$-manifold $M$ is a collection of smooth functions $\varphi_i : M \to \mathbb R$ such that $\varphi_i \ge 0$ and for all $m \in M$: $\sum_i \varphi_i(m) = 1$ and for only finitely many $i$: $\varphi_i (m) \neq 0$. We assume that a manifold is a second countable locally compact Hausdorff space and we use (without proof) that we can write such a space as a union of sets $G_i$ with the property that $\bigcup_i G_i = M$, $\overline{G_i}$ is compact and $\overline{G_i}\subseteq G_{i+1}$. I will also use that there exists a smooth map $\varphi: \mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R$ such that $\varphi$ is $1$ on the open cube of radius $1$ and $0$ outside the closed cube of radius $2$. Now the claim is: If $M$ is a smooth $n$-manifold and $U_i$ is an open cover of $M$ then there exists a partition of unity with compact support and $\mathrm{supp}(\varphi_i) $ contained in $U_i$. Here is the proof (how I understand it): Let $U_i$ be a given open cover of the smooth manifold $M$. Pick a point $m \in M$. Then $m \in U_i$ for some $i$. Let $(\psi, V)$ be any chart with $m \in V$. Then since scaling of a chart, translation of a chart and restriction of a chart to an open subset of $V$ yields again a chart we may assume that $\psi (m) = 0$ and that $\psi(V)$ contains the closed cube of radius $2$ and that $V \subseteq U_i \cap G_j \setminus \overline{G_{j-1}}$ where $j$ is the largest $j$ such that $m \notin \overline{G_j}$. Let $\widetilde{\varphi}: \mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R$ denote that map that is $1$ inside the open cube of radius $1$ centred at $0$ and $0$ outside the cube of radius $2$. Then we define a map $$ \varphi (m) = \begin{cases} 0 & m \notin V \\  \widetilde{\varphi} \circ \psi (m) & m \in V\end{cases}$$ Then it is clear that $\varphi$ is a smooth map $M \to \mathbb R$. Furthermore, since its support is contained in $\overline{V}$ and $\overline{V} \subseteq \overline{G_{j+1}}$ it is clear that the support is compact. For $m \in \overline{G_i} \setminus G_{i-1}$ let $N_m$ denote an open neighbourhood of $m$ contained in $\overline{G_i} \setminus G_{i-1}$ such that $\varphi$. By construction the set $\overline{G_i} \setminus G_{i-1}$ is compact.  For $m \in \overline{G_i} \setminus G_{i-1}$ let $U_m$ denote an open neighbourhood on which the previously constructed map $\varphi$ is $1$. Then since $\overline{G_i} \setminus G_{i-1}$ is compact we may cover it with finitely many such neighbourhoods. We do this for every $i$ so as to obtain a sequence of smooth maps $\varphi_k$. Since the sum $\sum_k \varphi_k$ has only finitely many terms not equal to zero this sum converges at every point in $M$. Hence we may define $$ \varphi_k' = {\varphi_k \over \sum_k \varphi_k'}$$ It is clear that $\varphi_k'$ form a partition of unity for $M$ subordinate to the cover $U_i$.",,"['differential-geometry', 'proof-verification']"

However, I cannot seem to find any very easy worked examples - i.e. $\mathbb{CP}^1$ or $\mathbb{CP}^2$ to complement the discussion there. So I tried to work things out for the latter of these myself. Maybe someone could point me at a decent source for examples or tell me whether my very pedestrian calculations make any sense. Thanks in advance. 1) Some notation. Consider $\mathbb{CP}^2 \subset \mathbb{C}^3$. For $z_i \in \mathbb{C}^3$ a point in $\mathbb{CP}^2$ is given by $(z_1: z_2: z_3) \sim (\lambda z_1:\lambda z_2:\lambda_3)$. An open covering is given by $U_i = \{(z_1:z_2:z_3) \vert z_i \neq 0\}$. Furthermore there are maps $\phi_1 : U_1 \to \mathbb{C}^2$, $(z_1:z_2:z_3) \mapsto (z_2/z_1, z_3/z_1) \equiv (w^{(1)}_1, w^{(1)}_2) \in \mathbb{C}^2$. We define maps $\phi_{2,3}$ and coordinates $w^{(2,3)}_j$ identically. I.e. the $w^{(i)}_j$ are coordinates in a patch $U_i$. On $U_i \cap U_j$ we can consider $\phi_{ij} \equiv \phi_i \circ \phi_j^{-1}$. 2) With this out of the way, consider the divisor $D_1$ defined (globally) by $\{ z_1 = 0\}$. In other words, on $U_2$, $D_1$ is defined by $w^{(2)}_1 = 0$, on $U_3$ by $w^{(3)}_1 = 0$. Now, we want to link this to a (global) section of $\mathcal{M}^* / \mathcal{O}^*$ where $\mathcal{M}^*$ is the sheaf of not identically zero meromorphic functions and $\mathcal{O}^*$ is the sheaf of non-zero holomorphic functions. On $U_{2}$ and $U_{3}$, $D_1$ is locally defined by the zeros of the functions $g_{2} \equiv w^{(2)}_1, g_{3} \equiv w^{(3)}_1$. Since $D_1 \cap U_1 = \emptyset$, we can pick $g_1 = 1$. Direct calculation shows that on the overlaps $U_i \cap U_j$ the quotients $\frac{g_i}{g_j} \in \mathcal{O}^*(U_i \cap U_j)$ and thus we have constructed our global section. 3) The next step is to construct the associated line bundle $[ D_1 ]$. Since $g_{ij} \equiv \frac{g_i}{g_j} \in \mathcal{O}^*(U_i \cap U_j)$, the $g_{ij}$ define transition functions / cocycles for a line bundle on $\mathbb{CP}^2$. 4) Finally we construct a global section of $\mathcal{O}(D_1)$. To do so we consider a generic polynomial in the patch $U_1$, $\sigma_1 = \sum_{i,j \geq 0} a_{ij} (w_1^{(1)})^i (w_2^{(1)})^j$ (where $\sigma_1 = \sigma \vert_{U_1}$ for a hypothetical global section $\sigma$). Using both the transition functions $g_{ij}$ as well as the earlier $\phi_{ij} = \phi_i \circ \phi_j^{-1}$ one finds that $$ \sigma_2 = w_1^{(2)} \sum_{i,j \geq 0} a_{ij} \left( \frac{1}{w^{(2)}_1} \right)^i \left( \frac{w^{(2)}_2}{w^{(2)}_1} \right)^j. $$ A similar result for $\sigma_3$ restricts the $a_{ij}$ such that a global holomorphic section is defined by $$ \sigma_1 = a_{00} + a_{10} w^{(1)}_1 + a_{01} w^{(1)}_2 $$ and similar in the other patches. 5) There is a simple generalisation to $n D_1$ as well as $D_{2,3}$. In the former case we have to garnish a number of expressions with exponentials ${}^n$. 6) Question: How does the torus $T^2$ action on $\mathbb{CP}^2$ act on the various line bundles $n D_i$?","I have been studying divisors using Griffiths/Harris (chapter 1.1) as well as Huybrechts (chapter 2.3).

On $U_{2}$ and $U_{3}$, $D_1$ is locally defined by the zeros of the functions $g_{2} \equiv w^{(2)}_1, g_{3} \equiv w^{(3)}_1$. Since $D_1 \cap U_1 = \emptyset$, we can pick $g_1 = 1$. Direct calculation shows that on the overlaps $U_i \cap U_j$ the quotients $\frac{g_i}{g_j} \in \mathcal{O}^*(U_i \cap U_j)$ and thus we have constructed our global section. 3) The next step is to construct the associated line bundle $[ D_1 ]$. Since $g_{ij} \equiv \frac{g_i}{g_j} \in \mathcal{O}^*(U_i \cap U_j)$, the $g_{ij}$ define transition functions / cocycles for a line bundle on $\mathbb{CP}^2$. 4) Finally we construct a global section of $\mathcal{O}(D_1)$. To do so we consider a generic polynomial in the patch $U_1$, $\sigma_1 = \sum_{i,j \geq 0} a_{ij} (w_1^{(1)})^i (w_2^{(1)})^j$ (where $\sigma_1 = \sigma \vert_{U_1}$ for a hypothetical global section $\sigma$). Using both the transition functions $g_{ij}$ as well as the earlier $\phi_{ij} = \phi_i \circ \phi_j^{-1}$ one finds that $$ \sigma_2 = w_1^{(2)} \sum_{i,j \geq 0} a_{ij} \left( \frac{1}{w^{(2)}_1} \right)^i \left( \frac{w^{(2)}_2}{w^{(2)}_1} \right)^j. $$ A similar result for $\sigma_3$ restricts the $a_{ij}$ such that a global holomorphic section is defined by $$ \sigma_1 = a_{00} + a_{10} w^{(1)}_1 + a_{01} w^{(1)}_2 $$ and similar in the other patches. 5) There is a simple generalisation to $n D_1$ as well as $D_{2,3}$. In the former case we have to garnish a number of expressions with exponentials ${}^n$. 6) Question: How does the torus $T^2$ action on $\mathbb{CP}^2$ act on the various line bundles $n D_i$?",,"['algebraic-geometry', 'differential-geometry', 'complex-geometry']"

Recall that the structure equations for a given frame field $(\mathbf{x},e)$ are $$d\omega^i = -\sum_{j=1}^3 \omega_j^i \wedge \omega^j, \qquad d\omega_j^i = -\sum_{k=1}^3 \omega_k^i \wedge \omega_i^k,$$ where $\omega^i = d\mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{e}_i$ and $\omega_i^j = d\mathbf{e}_i \cdot \mathbf{e}_j$.

One can check that choosing $\mathbf{e}_3$ normal at every point is equivalent to the condition that $\omega^3 = 0$ at every point of $U$. This is what we call a first-order frame field along $\mathbf{x}$. By Cartan's Lemma, a first order frame field satisfies $$\omega_i^3 = \sum_{j=1}^2 h_{ij} \omega^j, \qquad \text{for $i=1,2$ and $h_{12}=h_{21}$}.$$ Going back to the theory of surfaces of Gauss, we see that for this frame field, $I$ and $II$ are given by \begin{align} I &= d\mathbf{x} \cdot d\mathbf{x} = \omega^1\omega^1 + \omega^2\omega^2, \\ II &= -d\mathbf{x} \cdot d\mathbf{e}_3 = \omega^1\omega_1^3 + \omega^2\omega_2^3 \\  &= h_{11}\omega^1\omega^1 + 2h_{12}\omega^1\omega^2 + h_{22}\omega^2\omega^2. \end{align} Knowing this, my question is Given a smooth function $f : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^3$ such that $M = \Gamma(f)$ defines a smooth surface immersed in $\mathbb{R}^3$, what is its second fundamental form $II$ in term of differential forms?

59,Using a helical vector field to foliate $\mathbb{R}^3$,Using a helical vector field to foliate,\mathbb{R}^3,"Having finished an introductory course to GR as part of my physics undergrad degree, I decided to look at some differential geometry over the summer, and picked up Schutz's Geometrical methods of mathematical physics. On page 82 (in case you have access to the book), in a section on foliation, the author introduces a helical vector field: $\frac{\mathrm{dx}}{\mathrm{d}\lambda} = -\sin \lambda, \frac{\mathrm{dy}}{\mathrm{d}\lambda} = \cos \lambda, \frac{\mathrm{dz}}{\mathrm{d}\lambda} = 1 $ The integral curves of this field are helices, which appear to form a congruence over the manifold. Their equations are $x-x_0 = \cos\lambda, y-y_0 = \sin\lambda, z=\lambda$. Now, the author says, this vector field, together with the x-basis vector field (so I guess that's $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}$ at every point of the manifold), form a family of surfaces, each point in $\mathbb{R}^3$ being on one, so it foliates the manifold. However, the helical vector field, plus the z-basis vector field, do not together form a submanifold. The author specifically writes: ""The plane defined by the two at any point is not tangent to the 'next' spiral curve above or below it."" This has me confused - what does he mean? I thought that I should calculate the Lie brackets for each of the two pairs; they will foliate the manifold if their Lie brackets at all points are linear combinations of the two fields at that point (is that right?). However, I get that for neither pair does this condition hold. In the first case, I have $\overline{V} = -\sin\lambda\frac{\partial}{\partial x} + \cos\lambda\frac{\partial}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial}{\partial z},\\ \overline{X} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\\ \left[\overline{V},\overline{X}\right] = (\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \sin\lambda)\frac{\partial}{\partial x}-(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\cos\lambda)\frac{\partial}{\partial y} $ Even without explicitly evaluating $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\sin\lambda$ etc. I can already tell that the bracket is not tangent to a surface defined by the helix and x-axis vector fields, as the two tangent vectors at any point are $\overline{V}$ and $\overline{X}$, and the Lie bracket is just not a linear combination of them (except for points where the $\frac{\partial}{\partial y}$ coefficient vanishes). In the second case, the situation is very similar, up to a rescaling factor. So there are my questions: was I correct in looking at the Lie brackets of the helical vector field and the x-axis (z-axis) vector field to check whether they define a foliation, and if so, how does one get the correct Lie bracket, as I seem to be getting the wrong one!

Feel free to get very technical with your comments so that at the end I understand it well.  I am more concerned about the questions I added below, so if you want feel free to go straight in answering the questions. Morse function is generic in $C^{\infty}M$,where M is compact smooth manifold. Proof: Step 1 Given any smooth f on M we have: By compactness $\exists$ finitely many coordinate charts $ \{V_{p}\ ,\ \phi_{p}\}$,$M\subset \bigcup_{k=1}^{N}V_{k}$   with coordinates $x_{p,1},...,x_{p,m}\ $. Define $\Phi: \mathbb{R}^{N\cdot m}\times M\ni (\lambda_{p,i},x) \mapsto  f(x)+\sum_{p}\sum_{i=1,...,m}\lambda_{p,i}x_{p,i}(x)\cdot \phi_{p}(x) \in \mathbb{R}$ $\Rightarrow d\Phi:\mathbb{R}^{N\cdot m}\times M\to T^{*}M$, $d\Phi(\lambda_{p,i},x)=df(x)+\sum_{p,i=1,...,m}\lambda_{p,i}dl_{p,i}(x)$.

Now, let's say we have two isotopies $\tilde{f},\tilde{g}: [0,1]\times X \rightarrow X$ of $f$ to the identity, with $$ \tilde{f}(0,x) = \tilde{g}(0,x) = x \quad \forall x \in X,\\ \tilde{f}(1,x) = \tilde{g}(1,x) = f(x) \quad \forall x \in X. $$ Let $x$ be a point in $X$. We can now look at two paths $\alpha, \beta : [0,1] \rightarrow X$, definded by $$ \alpha(t) = \tilde{f}(t,x),\\ \beta(t) = \tilde{g}(t,x). $$ The two paths have the same start- and endpoints, namely $x$ and $f(x)$. It seems to be a well-known fact (I read about it in ""Farb, Margalit - A primer on mapping class groups (p.43)""), that on this surface, the maps $\tilde{f}$ and $\tilde{g}$ are homotopic.
