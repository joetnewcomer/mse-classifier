I'm trying to prove the following statement: $ \mathfrak{Mod}(A_{Y}/f) $ is a thick subcategory of $\mathfrak{Mod}(A_{Y})$ So, as defined in ""Sheaves on Manifolds"" (which is where this statement is from), it must be checked that for any $Y,Y',Z,Z' \in \mathfrak{Mod}(A_{Y}/f) $ and $X \in \mathfrak{Mod}(A_{Y})$ , if there is an exact sequence $$ Y \to Y' \to X \to Z' \to Z $$ then $X \in \mathfrak{Mod}(A_{Y}/f)$ But, since the sequence is exact, so is $ Y\vert_{f^{-1}(x)} \to Y'\vert_{f^{-1}(x)} \to X\vert_{f^{-1}(x)} \to Z'\vert_{f^{-1}(x)} \to Z\vert_{f^{-1}(x)}$ Since the restrictions are locally constant sheaves, (let us assume $f^{-1}(x)$ is connected) they have the same stalk at each point.

7,Zeta functions of hyperelliptic curves,Zeta functions of hyperelliptic curves,,"I have been wondering recently about the geometric information encoded in the zeta function of a (smooth, projective) variety over a finite field - or in its étale cohomology (i.e. l-adic cohomology) as a Galois module, I hope it's not a blunder to say they are equivalent data, if Tate's conjecture holds. For curves, one can read the genus off of it, but what about other invariants, such as the existence of certain maps to projective space? A precise question could be if we can tell whether a curve is hyperelliptic by only looking at its zeta function. I have a hunch this is not the case. If I'm not mistaken, the interesting part of the étale cohomology of a curve is essentially the Tate module of its Jacobian, and the hyperelliptic involution acts on the Jacobian as the inverse, it does not provide an interesting automorphism. Furthermore, if étale cohomology supposedly mimics the usual singular cohomology then I shouldn't expect it to single out hyperelliptic curves - this is a very weak argument, I admit, maybe hyperelliptic curves have peculiar Galois actions. I would expect a counterexample to exist, but a heuristic argument for why it should or shouldn't be true would be great as well.","I have been wondering recently about the geometric information encoded in the zeta function of a (smooth, projective) variety over a finite field - or in its étale cohomology (i.e. l-adic cohomology) as a Galois module, I hope it's not a blunder to say they are equivalent data, if Tate's conjecture holds.

The word ""Simple"" refers to that we can apply the standard techniques (see ""Proof of $(\color{RoyalBlue}2)$ "") used to prove the Nullstellensatz for fields. The key is to prove $\operatorname{Im} (A/\mathfrak p\to (A/\mathfrak p)_f/\mathfrak m)$ is a field and construct a maximal ideal as $\ker (A/\mathfrak p\to (A/\mathfrak p)_f/\mathfrak m)$ in $A/\mathfrak p$ in the arrow compositions below: $$k\to A/\mathfrak p\hookrightarrow (A/\mathfrak p)_f\twoheadrightarrow (A/\mathfrak p)_f/\mathfrak m$$ Here is the form of Nullstellensatz I would like to prove If $R$ is a Jacobson ring, then so is any finite generated $R$ -algebra $A$ .

Inspired by the classic Nullstellensatz for fields, we will need $\mathfrak p\cap R$ to be large enough to make $R/(\mathfrak p\cap R)$ a field.

Then looking at the composition arrows again for $\mathfrak q$ : $$R/(\mathfrak q\cap R)\to A/\mathfrak q\hookrightarrow (A/\mathfrak q)_f\twoheadrightarrow(A/\mathfrak q)_f/\mathfrak m_{\mathfrak q}$$ $(A/\mathfrak q)_f/\mathfrak m$ is a finite field extension of the field $R/(\mathfrak q\cap R)$ . As an intermediate extension, the image of $A/\mathfrak q$ in $(A/\mathfrak q)_f/\mathfrak m$ is also finite over $R/(\mathfrak q\cap R)$ , and must then be a field. Thus $\ker(A/\mathfrak q\to (A/\mathfrak q)_f/\mathfrak m)$ is a maximal ideal in $A/\mathfrak q$ , and corresponds to a maximal ideal in $A$ containing $\mathfrak p$ but not containing $f$ , contradiction. The hypothesis is true, for example this gives a sharper result, showing $(A/\mathfrak q)_f$ is a field. And then use the fact that $R/(\mathfrak q\cap R)\hookrightarrow (A/\mathfrak q)_f$ is a finite type extension from a Jacobson ring to a field to deduce $R/(\mathfrak q\cap R)$ is a field, as shown here .

On pges 355/356 in Fulton & Harris' Representation Theory is shown that the stadard representation of Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}_2$ is seven-dimensional irrep $V = \mathbb{C}^7$ . In the Chapter 23.3 on homogeneous spaces, page 391, is discussed how irreps of $\mathfrak{g}_2$ give rise for parabolic subgroups $P \subset G_2$ . The action of the Lie algebra on the standard rep $V$ induces an action on projectivized space $\mathbb{P}V \cong \mathbb{P}^6 $ . Via exponentiation this induces an action of $G_2$ on $\mathbb{P}V$ . Let $p \in \mathbb{P}V$ be the line corresponding to the eigenspace of the highest weight $\lambda_V$ of $V$ , because $V$ is irrep. The correspondence tells us that the parabolic group $P_{\lambda} \subset G_2$ corresponds to the stabilizer of $p$ and thus the orbit $G \cdot p$ equals $G_2/P_{\lambda}$ . The part I not understand: the book claims then that the orbit $G \cdot p$ can only be a quadric hypersurface, since it is homogeneous. Why that's the case? The way the argument is phrased suggests that since the orbit $G \cdot p$ is a hyperplane of $\mathbb{P}^6 $ which is by construction a homogeneous space, one should conclude that it must be a quadric surface. This conclusion is not clear me. I'm not sure if it helps but on pages 355/356 one obtained as result of the careful analysis of properties of $V$ , that the action of $\mathfrak{g}_2$ on $V$ preserves a quadratic form. Could one maybe use somehow this insight to conclude that $G \cdot p$ is given as quadric hypersurface of $ \mathbb{P}V$ ?

We say that two such varieties $V,U \subseteq \mathbb{CP}^n$ are projectively equivalent if one can be transformed to the other by a projective transformation (i.e. they are in the same orbit of the action of $PGL(n)$ on subsets of $\mathbb{CP}^n$ ). As explained for example here and here , given a finite set of homogeneous polynomials $p_1(x_1,...x_{n+1}),...,p_k(x_1,...x_{n+1})$ , the algebra of invariants of these polynomials is the (graded) algebra of all those polynomials in the coefficients of the original polynomials, which are invariant, up to a multiplicative factor, under the action of $GL(n+1)$ on $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ . In addition, that constant factor has to be a power of the determinant of the transformation. In other words, the invariants are polynomial functions in the coefficients of the original polynomials, such that when one substitutes in the original polynomials a linear change of variables, the invariants stay the same, up to a factor which is a power of the determinant of the linear change of variables. Similarly (as explained in the references), one also has the algebra of covariants of a set of polynomials, which is defined similarly except that the covariants are polynomial functions in the coefficients of the original polynomials and in the variables themselves. According to Hilbert's Basis Theorem, both algebras are finitely generated. Now, invariants of a set of homogeneous polynomials are not enough to characterize the corresponding embedded projective variety up to projective equivalence. For example (as described in both references), for a binary cubic, i.e. a homogeneous polynomial of degree 3 in 2 variables, the algebra of invariants is generated by the discriminant, but the discriminant is 0 if the cubic has a double root and a single root, or if the cubic has a triple root. The first case corresponds to the cubic representing a variety in $\mathbb{CP}^{1}$ consisting of two distinct points, while the second case corresponds to the cubic representing a variety in $\mathbb{CP}^{1}$ consisting of a single point. These two are clearly not projectively equivalent. However, the above book by Olver also mentions that the invariants and covariants together are enough to characterize the corresponding sets of points up to projective equivalence. Specifically, a binary cubic has its hessian as a covariant; while one cannot speak of the value of the hessian of a binary cubic (since it is a function of $x_1,x_2$ as well as being a function of the coefficients), one can speak of the hessian being identically zero or not - and more generally, of two hessians being equal, up to a factor (by which I mean that one hessian is a multiple of the other by a number). Olver shows that the hessian vanishes identically iff the cubic has a triple root; thus the discriminant and hessian together completely characterize the set of zeros of a binary cubic up to projective equivalence - if the roots are distinct then both are nonzero; if there is a double root then the discriminant vanishes but the hessian does not; and if there is a triple root then both vanish. My question, roughly, is whether this idea generalizes to arbitrary embedded varieties. Are the algebras of invariants and covariants of the defining polynomials, together, enough to characterize the embedded variety up to projective equivalence? To state the question precisely, we need to first introduce absolute invariants - these are invariants that do not change at all under a projective transformation of the coordinates (i.e. even a multiplication by a power of the determinant is now not allowed), but they are allowed to be rational functions of the coefficients of the original polynomials - not only polynomials in them. The first kind of invariants that we discussed are now called relative invariants. It is easy to realize and see that the field of absolute invariants of a finite set of polynomials is generated by certain quotients of powers of the generators of their algebra of relative invariants (basically you take quotients of two generators, each raised to a power, such that the resulting quotient is unchanged by a projective transformation because the determinantal powers in the numerator and denominator cancel each other). Similarly one has absolute covariants and their field, with its generators. Now, say we are given two finite sets of homogeneous polynomials over $\mathbb{C}$ , $p_1(x_1,...x_{n+1}),...,p_k(x_1,...x_{n+1})$ and $q_1(x_1,...x_{n+1}),...,q_k(x_1,...x_{n+1})$ , both having the same number of polynomials, and with the polynomials having the same degrees $d_1,...d_k$ . Take a generating set $b_1,...b_m$ for the field of absolute invariants of a set of $k$ polynomials of degrees $d_1,...d_k$ , and take a generating set $c_1,...c_l$ for the field of absolute covariants of a set of $k$ polynomials of degrees $d_1,...d_k$ . Suppose that every invariant in $b_1,...b_m$ has the same value for the polynomials in $p_1(x_1,...x_{n+1}),...,p_k(x_1,...x_{n+1})$ and for those in $q_1(x_1,...x_{n+1}),...,q_k(x_1,...x_{n+1})$ (that is, when the coefficients of these polynomials are substituted in the rational functions $b_1,...b_m$ , the same complex numbers are obtained). Suppose also that every covariant in $c_1,...c_l$ is equal for the polynomials in $p_1(x_1,...x_{n+1}),...,p_k(x_1,...x_{n+1})$ and for the polynomials in $q_1(x_1,...x_{n+1}),...,q_k(x_1,...x_{n+1})$ (equality here is not equality of complex numbers, but equality in a certain field of rational functions). Does it follow that the two embedded varieties defined by $p_1(x_1,...x_{n+1}),...,p_k(x_1,...x_{n+1})$ and $q_1(x_1,...x_{n+1}),...,q_k(x_1,...x_{n+1})$ are projectively equivalent? (technically one should also consider the case when some of the absolute invariants and covariants are undefined since the substitution causes some denominators of the rational functions which define them to be zero, but this is already complicated enough so let's just forget about this case for now.) Another related question that naturally follows from this is whether the invariants only are enough, if we restrict ourselves to irreducible varieties. In the above exmaple of a binary cubic, the covariant (the hessian) is only needed to distinguish between the two degenerate cases that result from the defining equation being reducible (a double root and a triple root). If we restrict ourselves to varieties defined by irreducible polynomials, are the values of the invariants in a generating set $b_1,...b_m$ for the field of absolute invariants enough to determine the variety up to projective equivalence? Further related questions are what happens when we look at varieties/polynomials above $\mathbb{R}$ instead of $\mathbb{C}$ ? Above other fields? And what happens when we look at equivalence relative to subgroups of $GL(n+1)$ instead of the full group (such as affine equivalence or euclidean equivalence) - since as is well known, such subgroups also have their corresponding algebras of invariants? I welcome any partial answer or direction to answering any of these questions. Resources on classical invariant theory are notoriously difficult to find, and I was somewhat surprised that this question is not addressed in any resource that I know (even though Olver's book above comes very close to discussing this question, but then backs away). It seems like a question that would have been pretty interesting to the projective geometers of the 19th century. For this reason, if anyone knows a nice reference that discusses the relation of classical invariant theory to projective geometry, I'd also like to know (Salmon's classic treatises don't seem to answer this question).","Let be a projective variety embedded in complex projective n-space.

Given an etale sheaf $\mathcal G_0$ on $X_0$ , let $\mathcal G$ be the pullback $\pi^* \mathcal G_0$ . The Frobenius $F: X \to X$ induces, by adjunction induces a natural map $\mathcal G \to F_* F^* \mathcal G$ which in turn induces $H^i(X, \mathcal G) \to H^i(X, F^* \mathcal G)$ . The key ingredient to getting the Frobenius action on the cohomology is to get a map $F^*\mathcal G \to \mathcal G$ , which is an isomorphism. It is this map I have trouble understanding. In Bhargav Bhatt's seminar here, at the end of page 8 , we see the desired map being defined roughly as follows: Firstly there are the two projection maps $\text{pr}_1$ and $\text{pr}_2$ , $X\times_{X_0}X \to X$ , and they satisfy $\pi \circ \text{pr}_1=\pi \circ \text{pr}_2$ . From this, we get $\text{pr}_1^* \circ \pi^*\mathcal G_0=\text{pr}_2^* \circ \pi^*\mathcal G_0$ , which means that $\text{pr}_1^* \mathcal G$ and $\text{pr}_2^*\mathcal G$ are equal on the nose.

I don't see why this should be. A typical element of $X\times_{X_0}X$ is a pair $(x,y)$ such that $\pi(x)=\pi(y)$ .

58,On reduced functors and closed complements of open subfunctors,On reduced functors and closed complements of open subfunctors,,"In the following, I adopt the functorial perspective on schemes. That is, for any ring $R$ , the category of $R$ -schemes is considered a (full) sub-category of the category $\mathcal{C}$ of all functors from $R$ -algebras to sets, affine schemes being those functors isomorphic to $\operatorname{Hom}(A,-)$ for some $R$ -algebra $A$ . The objects of $\mathcal{C}$ are called $R$ -functors for short. Many definitions and basic results on $R$ -schemes naturally generalize to $R$ -functors. For example, an open (resp. closed) subfunctor of some $R$ -functor $F$ is, by definition, a subfunctor $U$ such that for any $R$ -algebra $A$ and for any morphism $\varphi \colon \operatorname{Hom}(A,-) \to F$ , the preimage $\varphi^{-1}(U)$ is open (resp. closed) in $\operatorname{Hom}(A,-)$ in the usual sense. It is easy to show that any closed subfunctor $C \subseteq F$ has a unique open ""complement"" $O \subseteq F$ , where complementary means that $C \cap O = \emptyset$ and $C(K) \cup O(K) = F(K)$ for all fields $K$ (in the category of $R$ -algebras). Question 1: Does the converse hold? That is: does any open subfunctor have a (non-unique) closed complement? Looking at the sub-category of schemes, there is a canonical construction for closed complements as we know that any open subscheme has a unique reduced closed complement. Having the notion of a reduced functor would certainly help a lot for proving the converse true. This leads me to the following question: Question 2: Is there a meaningful generalization of reduced schemes to $R$ -functors? Let's see an example: Let $F$ be the $R$ -functor of all elements of finite multiplicative order, that is, $$ F(A) = \{ x \in A : x^n = 1 \text{ for some } n \in \mathbb{N} \} $$ for all $R$ -algebras $A$ . We define a subfunctor $O \subseteq F$ which, roughly speaking, consists of all elements of composite order. More formally: $$ O(A) = \{ x \in F(A) : x^p-1 \in A^\times \text{ for all primes } p \}. $$ Using the definition mentioned above, one can easily show that $O$ is open in $F$ (although $O$ is defined by an infinite intersection, the pre-image of $O$ into any affine scheme becomes a finite intersection of open subschemes, which is open again). For any field $K$ , the set $O(K)$ indeed consists of all elements of composite order in $K$ . So if there is any closed complement $C$ of $O$ in $F$ then $C(K)$ would be the set of all elements of prime order in $K$ - together with $1 \in K$ . I have not found such a complement so far. Question 3: Does $O$ have a closed complement in $F$ ? Update 1 (some thoughts) Both open and closed subfunctors of an $R$ -functor $F$ can be regarded as compatible collections of ideals. More concretely, any open subfunctor of $F$ is equivalent to the assignment of radical ideals $I_{A,a} \subseteq A$ for all $R$ -algebras $A$ and all elements $a \in F(A)$ such that for all morphisms $f \colon A \to B$ of $R$ -algebras, we have $\sqrt{\langle f(I_{A,a}) \rangle} = I_{B,F(f)(a)}$ . Let's call such an assignment an open ideal collection of $F$ . The corresponding open subfunctor $O$ of $F$ is given by $O(A) = \{ a \in F(A) : I_{A,a} = A \}$ . Analogously, a closed subfunctor of $F$ is equivalent to the assignment of ideals (not necessarily radicals) $I_{A,a} \subseteq A$ for all $R$ -algebras $A$ and all elements $a \in F(A)$ such that for all morphisms $f \colon A \to B$ of $R$ -algebras, we have $\langle f(I_{A,a}) \rangle = I_{B,F(f)(a)}$ . Let's call such an assignment a closed ideal collection of $F$ . The corresponding closed subfunctor $C$ of $F$ is given by $C(A) = \{ a \in F(A) : I_{A,a} = 0 \}$ . From this point of view, we immediately see that closed subfunctors have open complements, as we can canonically transform closed ideal collections into open ideal collections by simply taking radicals. If all open subfunctors would have closed complements, and if there were such a thing as reduced functors, we should also be able to canonically transform closed ideal collections into open ideal collections. For example, maybe an open collection $(I_{A,a})$ could be transformed into a closed collection by defining $J_{A,a}$ to be those ideal generated by $f(I_{B,b})$ for all morphisms $f \colon B \to A$ with $F(f)(b) = a$ ? Concerning reduced functors, I actually think we could define the reduction of $F$ as the intersection of all closed subfunctors $C$ of $F$ such that $C(K) = F(K)$ for all fields $K$ . Then, as usual, a functor would be reduced if it coincides with its reduction. Can someone confirm that this definition generalizes reduced schemes? Update 2 (Reduction of question 1 to a single functor!) My previous thoughts (update 1) can be reformulated in a very neat way. Let us consider two specific $R$ -functors. For any $R$ -algebra $A$ , let $\mathcal{R}(A)$ be the set of radical ideals of $A$ , and let $\mathcal{I}(A)$ be the set of ideals of $A$ . For any morphism $f \colon A \to B$ of $R$ -algebras, let $\mathcal{R}(f) \colon \mathcal{R}(A) \to \mathcal{R}(B)$ be the map $I \mapsto \sqrt{\langle f(I) \rangle}$ , and let $\mathcal{I}(f) \colon \mathcal{I}(A) \to \mathcal{I}(B)$ be the map $I \mapsto \langle f(I) \rangle$ . So both $\mathcal{I}$ and $\mathcal{R}$ are $R$ -functors. We obviously have a canonical morphism $\phi \colon \mathcal{I} \to \mathcal{R}$ given by $I \mapsto \sqrt{I}$ . My previous considerations show that an open subfunctor of a functor $F$ is actually the same as a morphism $F \to \mathcal{R}$ . Similarly, a closed subfunctor of $F$ corresponds to a morphism $F \to \mathcal{I}$ . Any closed subfunctor of $F$ given by $F \to \mathcal{I}$ can be transformed to its unique open complement by composition with $\phi$ . Conversely, given any open subfunctor of $F$ corresponding to $\alpha \colon F \to \mathcal{R}$ , finding a closed complement means finding a morphism $\beta \colon F \to \mathcal{I}$ such that $\alpha = \phi \circ \beta$ . Of course this characterization holds for $F = \mathcal{R}$ in particular. In this way we get an equivalent reformulation to question 1: Question 1': Does the canonical morphism $\mathcal{I} \to \mathcal{R}$ have a section? Note that the identity morphism of $\mathcal{R}$ defines an open subfunctor of $\mathcal{R}$ , namely $O(A) = \{A\}$ for all $R$ -algebras $A$ . So we can reformulate question 1 even further so that there is only one functor involved: Question 1'': Does the open subfunctor $O \subseteq \mathcal{R}$ have a closed complement? This is really surprising to me: Every open subfunctor of every $R$ -functor has closed complements if and only if one specific open subfunctor of one specific functor has closed complements! However, I doubt that this is the case: If there was a closed complement, there would also be a canonical closed complement (the intersection of all closed complements). So there would be a canonical section of $\phi \colon \mathcal{I} \to \mathcal{R}$ . This appears to me as highly unlikely...","In the following, I adopt the functorial perspective on schemes.

This theorem gives an (almost) effective procedure for determining whether two curves, given parametrically by functions which are computable, are congruent. Calculating curvature involves only derivatives and so is always tractable. So the only difficulty applying this method is that we need to parameterize both curves in terms of their arc length, which involves an integral.

68,Sheaf Axioms and Limits - Intuition,Sheaf Axioms and Limits - Intuition,,"The question is based on the following problem from Vakil's notes in Algebraic Geometry: 2.2.C. The identity and gluability axioms (of sheaves) may be interpreted as saying that $\mathcal{F}(\cup_i U_i)$ is a certain limit. What is that limit? The precise solution / proof / answer to this question isn't as interesting to me as the intuitive approach we take to get there, because while thinking about this problem, I've realized that I am quite confused about the intuition behind limits and colimits. Before going into my thoughts, here are some stack exchange questions and links I found in looking into ths: In (relatively) simple words: What is an inverse limit? Inverse vs direct limits intuition for limits Limits wiki page (I have looked at more answers, but these seemed the most relevant to what I want to ask) Here are two trains of thought I've had for each (these will be quite hand-wavey. As I said, I'm not looking at the proof just yet. I'm more interested in the intuition): For viewing the axioms as limits: The motivating example of limits in my head are p-adic numbers. Ravi brings them up as his primary example as well (1.4.1 - 1.4.B). It seems like they key idea here is that the limit is some 'global' object that we demand that it behaves well locally. Based on the stack exchange posts linked above, I got the sense of something similar - inverse limits are 'zoomed out' objects, and we construct them from their local projections, just like p-adic numbers. Now I could argue that this is the spirit of the two axioms, one is defining a global object (the unique global section you get after gluing) and making sure it plays well locally. For viewing the axioms as colimits: The motivating example of colimits is fractions, according to Ravi. I don't have a very good sense for this, even though I can formally work out proofs of exercises such as 1.4.C, which asks to prove that $\mathbb{Q} = \varinjlim \frac{1}{n}\mathbb{Z}$ . I don't see any obvious way (even within the stack exchange answers) to view the gluing axioms in this sense. But I do intuitively feel comfortable with viewing colimits as disjoint unions modulo the relevant relations (one could ask me why this makes sense intuitively and not the fraction view, and one would not get a satisfying answer since I don't intuitively see their connection). With the disjoint union view, viewing colimits as unions makes intuitive sense, and this seems to be exactly the spirit of the gluing axioms - where we are literally gluing ('union-ing') the different sections to get a bigger section.

I have a hard time developing a common sense or any intuition how to tell the result of a gluing morphism immediately and I would appreciate any help in this direction. I'm missing the concrete detailed math behind that as well, would be cool if someone can give more details here. The two examples I am looking at: In both cases, we have the original lattice $N=\mathbb{Z}^2$ and the dual $M=\mathbb{Z}^2$ . Projective Space Let's start with the given fan of $X=\mathbb{P}^2$ : We can concretely calculate the toric varieties $X_{\sigma_i}$ and then glue them together along the walls $\tau_{ij} = \sigma_i \cap \sigma_j$ . In general we have $X_{\sigma} = \text{Spec} (R_{\sigma}) = \text{Spec}(\{f\in \mathbb{C}[z_1^{\pm 1},z_2^{\pm 1}]: \text{supp } f \subset S_{\sigma} = \check{\sigma} \cap M\})$ where $\check{\sigma}$ is the dual of $\sigma\subset N$ in $M$ . So looking at $\sigma_1$ we get $\check{\sigma}_1 = \text{Cone}(-e_1, -e_1+e_2)$ which converts to $R_{\sigma_1} = \mathbb{C}[z_1^{-1},z_1^{-1}z_2]$ and thus $X_{\sigma_1} = \mathbb{C}^2_{(z_1^{-1}, z_1^{-1}z_2)}$ (the coordinates are noted as subscripts). Analogously we can calculate $X_{\sigma_0} = \mathbb{C}^2_{(z_1, z_2)}$ and $X_{\sigma_2} = \mathbb{C}^2_{(z_2^{-1}, z_1z_2^{-1})}$ . Let's start by gluing $X_{\sigma_0}$ and $X_{\sigma_1}$ along $(z_1,z_2) \mapsto (z_1^{-1}, z_1^{-1}z_2)$ . How can I picture this gluing morphism? In my understanding we get that $(z_1,z_2)_{\sigma_0} \sim (z_1^{-1},z_1^{-1}z_2)_{\sigma_1}$ , where $\sim$ is the equivalence relation of the gluing morphism. What are the steps to get that $(X_{\sigma_0} \cup X_{\sigma_1}) / \sim$ is the same as $\mathbb{P}^2 \setminus \{(0:0:1\}$ ? What I thought about is the following: As we are matching $z_1$ and $z_1^{-1}$ we need $\mathbb{P}^1$ , $\mathbb{C}$ is not sufficient anymore. Therefore I would write the above glued variety as $\{((t_0:t_1), z_2): \frac{t_0}{t_1}=z_1\}\simeq \mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{C}$ . However two questions arise from this set: First, why aren't we taking $\frac{t_1}{t_0}=z_1$ and second where did $z_1^{-1}z_2$ go? Assume I somehow managed this part, I get completely lost with the next gluing! Do I now have to glue $X_{\sigma_2}$ along two rays, do I need to glue all affine patches pairwise and then glue everything together or can I glue $X_{\sigma_2}$ directly with $(X_{\sigma_0} \cup X_{\sigma_1}) / \sim$ and if so, how can I do that? I would really appreciate a detailed answer because everywhere in the literature this seems to be ""trivial"". Hirzebruch surface The calculation of each affine patch is no problem for me. We get $$ X_{\sigma_1} = \mathbb{C}^2_{(z_1,z_2)} \\ X_{\sigma_2} = \mathbb{C}^2_{(z_1,z_2^{-1})} \\ X_{\sigma_3} = \mathbb{C}^2_{(z_1^{-1},z_1^{-r}z_2^{-1})} \\ X_{\sigma_4} = \mathbb{C}^2_{(z_1^{-1},z_1^rz_2)} \\ $$ How can I glue them together? As before we can glue $X_{\sigma_1}$ with $X_{\sigma_2}$ along the second coordinate (that means we identify $(z_1,z_2)_{\sigma_1}$ with $(z_1,z_2^{-1})_{\sigma_2}$ ) and $X_{\sigma_3}$ with $X_{\sigma_4}$ along the second coordinate as well. For simplification define $X_I:=(\bigcup_{i\in I}X_{\sigma_i}) / \sim $ These two gluings give $$X_{12} = \{(z_1, (t_0:t_1)): \frac{t_0}{t_1}=z_2\}\simeq \mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{C}$$ and $$X_{34} = \{(z_1^{-1}, (s_0:s_1)): \frac{s_0}{s_1}=z_1^rz_2\}\simeq \mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{C}$$ Again the (small) question, can we choose $\frac{t_1}{t_0}=z_2$ or $\frac{s_1}{s_0}=z_1^rz_2$ as well? So far so good. We can now glue those two varieties along the first coordinate and that's where I get stuck. I would suggest something of a similar form $\{((u_0:u_1), (s_0:s_1)):\: ...\}$ . However the solutions seems to be $$ X_{1234} = \{((\lambda_0:\lambda_1:\lambda_2), (\mu_0:\mu_1)) : \lambda_0\mu_0^r = \lambda_1\mu_1^r\} $$ How is this equation derived and what is the intuition behind that? In general, what happens if we don't have the ability to glue some $f(z)$ and $f^{-1}(z)$ together (in above examples it was $f(z)=z_1$ , $f(z)=z_2$ or $f(z)=z_1^rz_2$ ) for a resulting $\mathbb{P}^1$ ?

72,Do strict henselizations satisfy Going-Up?,Do strict henselizations satisfy Going-Up?,,"Let $(A,\mathfrak{m})$ be a local ring. (I'd be ok assuming it's noetherian, if that's helpful, although I'd also be surprised if the answer really depended on this.) Let $A^{sh}$ be a strict henselization of $A$ . My question is this: Does the structure map $A\rightarrow A^{sh}$ satisfy Going-Up ? Intuitively, I think it should, for reasons I'll mention in a moment; on the other hand, in standard lists of basic properties of the strict henselization such as those at Stacks Project and EGA IV 18.8.12 and 18.8.13, I don't recall seeing this mentioned. The (quite hand-wavy) reasons I believe that $A\rightarrow A^{sh}$ ""ought"" to satisfy Going-Up are as follows: Fixing a map $\phi: A\rightarrow k^{sep}$ from $A$ to a separable closure $k^{sep}$ of its residue field, $A\rightarrow A^{sh}$ is the limit over diagrams of the form $A \xrightarrow{f} A' \xrightarrow{\psi} k^{sep}$ , where $f$ is étale and $\phi = \psi\circ f$ . (This is the definition of $A^{sh}$ given in Milne's book on étale cohomology, see p. 38.) In general, étale extensions don't satisfy Going-Up. However, this is only because they allow a ""certain amount of localization"": by this I mean that any étale extension is, up to isomorphism, standard étale, i.e., of the form $A[x]_h/(g)$ , where $g,h \in A[x]$ and $g$ is monic (there's also a condition how $g,h$ relate); it is a localization of the integral extension $A \rightarrow A[x]/(g)$ , which does satisfy Going-Up. Going-Up can thus only fail if the ""localization step"" of inverting $h$ destroys the primes of $A[x]/(g)$ that lie over a target prime of $A$ in the right way. Furthermore, the étale extensions $A'$ used in constructing $A^{sh}$ are not arbitrary but precisely those having a maximal ideal that pulls back to $\mathfrak{m}$ in $A$ ; this is what makes it possible for them to fit into the diagram $A \xrightarrow{f} A' \xrightarrow{\psi} k^{sep}$ . Thus $\mathfrak{m}$ , and therefore any prime of $A$ (as they are all contained in $\mathfrak{m}$ ), ""survives the localization step"" in the construction of all the étale extensions used to build $A^{sh}$ . Now it seems to me that, given a prime $\mathfrak{p}$ of $A$ , some of the primes lying over it in the intermediate étale extensions $A'=A[x]_h/(g)$ will be contained in other maximals of $A[x]/(g)$ than the one that ends up being the kernel of $\psi:A'\rightarrow k^{sep}$ , which could therefore get destroyed by the localization at $h$ ; so the intermediate $A'$ 's probably won't satisfy Going-Up. However, any such primes will be destroyed by a later localization, since $A^{sh}$ is local. Thus it seems to me that in each intermediate $A'$ , Going-Up is going to hold for the primes inside $\ker \psi$ (I mean if $\mathfrak{q}\subset \ker \psi$ pulls back to $\mathfrak{p}$ in $A$ , and $\mathfrak{p}_1\subset A$ contains $\mathfrak{p}$ , then there exists $\mathfrak{q}_1\subset\ker \psi$ pulling back to $\mathfrak{p}_1$ ); and then in $A^{sh}$ , a similar situation will exist with respect to the kernel of $A^{sh}\rightarrow k^{sep}$ , except that these will be all the primes. This train of thought is, of course, rather soft (or I wouldn't be asking the question). It is a standard property of $A\rightarrow A^{sh}$ that it is faithfully flat and of relative dimension zero. Thus Going-Down , Lying-Over , and Incomparability obtain for $A\rightarrow A^{sh}$ . It is not the case that every faithfully flat map of relative dimension zero satisfies Going-Up (see here ); still, it renders it at least plausible in this case? This is insanely vague, but: while I haven't seen Going-Up listed as a standard property of $A\rightarrow A^{sh}$ , other standard properties do suggest that it ""behaves well"" with respect to chains of primes. E.g., $A^{sh}$ is universally catenary if and only if $A$ is universally catenary (EGA IV 18.8.17). This is perhaps even more insanely vague. I understand $\operatorname{Spec}A^{sh}$ geometrically as a kind of ""universal cover of a very small neighborhood of [the closed point of] $\operatorname{Spec} A$ "". Ascending chains of primes in $A$ are, geometrically, descending flags of irreducible subschemes each of which hits the closed point of $\operatorname{Spec}A$ . Thinking by analogy with covering space theory in, e.g., the category of smooth manifolds, any such flag ought to be able to be seen in a very small neighborhood, and ought to be able to be lifted to a universal cover. If I start with a lift of some irreducible subscheme of $\operatorname{Spec}A$ to $\operatorname{Spec}A^{sh}$ , I ought (again purely by analogy with topological covering space theory) be able to lift any irreducible sub-subscheme downstairs to a sub-subscheme upstairs as well.

Question 1: Is it true that $A/p$ is Cohen-Macaulay? My answer: Yes, it is true that $A/p$ is CM, and the same proof holds. More elaborately: If $\operatorname{ht}(p)=0$ then $p=(0)$ , so trivially $A/p=A/0=A$ is CM. If $\operatorname{ht}(p)=1$ , then $p$ is principal, since a height one prime in a UFD is principal, see wikipedia (11). Then by the nice proposition in this answer, $A/p$ is CM.

Indeed, $(x^2-y^3)$ is a height one prime of $k[x,y]$ and $k[x,y]/(x^2-y^3)=k[z^2,z^3]$ is CM but not regular (since regular implies normal, but $k[z^2,z^3]$ is not normal, namely, not integrally closed in its field of fractions $k(z)$ ). Question 2: What happens if $\operatorname{ht}(p)=n-1$ ? In that case we have a one-dimensional integral domain $A/p$ ; is it necessarily regular?.

Here it is sketched shortly (source: Here ) and I want to fill the gaps: Let $X$ be an $n$ -dimensional complex projective algebraic variety closed embedded in $\mathbb{CP}^n$ and let $Y$ be a hyperplane section of $X$ such that $U = X ∖ Y$ is smooth. Lefschetz used his idea of a Lefschetz pencil to prove the theorem. Rather than considering the hyperplane section $Y$ alone, he put it into a family of hyperplane sections $Y_t$ , where $Y = Y_0$ . Because a generic hyperplane section is smooth, all but a finite number of $Y_t$ are smooth varieties. After removing these points from the $t$ -plane and making an additional finite number of slits, the resulting family of hyperplane sections is topologically trivial. That is, it is a product of a generic $Y_t$ with an open subset of the $t$ -plane. $X$ , therefore, can be understood if one understands how hyperplane sections are identified across the slits and at the singular points. Away from the singular points, the identification can be described inductively. At the singular points, the Morse lemma implies that there is a choice of coordinate system for $X$ of a particularly simple form. This coordinate system can be used to prove the theorem directly. The original source is 'L'Analysis situs et la géométrie algébrique' but I can't get along with that text. So I would be happy if someone could help me to clear up the understanding problems. That's, what I understand so far: We take any arbitrary pencil $\{Y_t \}_{t \in \mathbb{CP}^1}$ of hyperplanes in $X$ with $Y_0=Y$ (that is what we really do is we take a family $\{H_t \}_{t \in \mathbb{CP}^1}$ of hyperplanes in $\mathbb{CP}^n$ such that for every member $H_t$ the intersection $X \cap H_t$ is a $n-1$ -dimensional variety with is for almost all $t$ smooth and we set $Y_t:=  X \cap H_t$ . Then we consider the canonical map $\{Y_t \}_{t \in \mathbb{CP}^1} \to \mathbb{CP}^1$ , remove all $t_i$ which have singular fibers (only finitely many) and make some marvelous cuts $S$ in the projective line $\mathbb{CP}^1$ making the the restriction $\{Y_t \}_{t \in \mathbb{CP}^1 ∖ S} \to \mathbb{CP}^1 ∖ S$ trivial. Although it isn't explicitely explained I think that it is reasonable to assume that the cuts a done in that way that $\mathbb{CP}^1 ∖ S$ becomes simply connected, so the fibration becomes trivial. Is that true? Are the cuts in the original proof indeed done in same spirit like in the original construction of Riemann surfaces, to make the base simply connected? So we consider now $\{Y_t \}_{t \in \mathbb{CP}^1 ∖ S}= Y_0 \times (\mathbb{CP}^1 ∖ S)$ . Next the identifications along the slits are concretely performed. The text refers to an inductive argument. How is then the induction step done?

It essentially characterizes what the normalization of an affine toric variety is. The construction is as follows: Pick $V=\operatorname{Spec}(\mathbb{C}[\mathsf{S}])$ where $\mathsf{S}$ is an affine semigroup. Let $\mathscr{A} = \{m_1,\ldots,m_s\}\subseteq \mathsf{S}$ be such that $\mathbb{N}\mathscr{A} = \mathsf{S}$ , and let $M = \mathbb{Z}\mathscr{A}$ be the lattice of characters of the torus of $V$ .

Thanks in advance.","k[x,y,z,w]/(wz-xy,wy-x^2,xz-y^2) k (wz-xy,wy-x^2,xz-y^2)","['algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra', 'affine-varieties']"

Let $P\leq G$ be an algebraic subgroup and let $Y \subseteq X$ be a closed subvariety, invariant under $P$ . Then a number of texts define the construction of the so called ""contracted"" or ""twisted"" product give by $G \times^P Y := G \times Y /\sim \quad \quad$ where $(gp, y) \sim (g, py)$ for all $p \in P$ . My question is this: What is the algebraic interpretation of this geometric space and how should I be thinking about this scheme? In the case that it is affine, is there simple description of its coordinate ring? Also does anyone have any references for a good exposition of these concepts? If there were a more categorical description of this object that would also be amazing (i.e. a definition given by diagrams etc.). Thanks!
