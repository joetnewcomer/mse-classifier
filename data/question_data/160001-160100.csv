Here are two: It is pointed out in Milne's notes (pdf, bottom of page 44) that the holomorphic 1-form $dz$ transforms like a modular form of weight -2, in that under a modular transformation becomes $(cz + d)^{-2} dz$. Therefore, modular forms $f(z)$ of weight 2 are in correspondence with modular invariant 1-forms $f(z)dz$ and so we can think of them as sections of the line bundle $L$ of such forms over the quotient $\mathbb{H}^2//SL(2,Z)$, where $\mathbb{H}^2$ is the upper half-plane. Likewise, modular forms of weight $2k$ are sections of $L^k$. It's known (and easy to show) that $H^2(\mathbb{H}^2//SL(2,Z),Z) = Z_{12}$. Does the Chern class of $L$ generate this group? Or is there a square-root of this bundle whose sections are modular forms of weight 1? I think it cannot be because such forms cannot be invariant under the central element $-1 \in SL(2,Z)$. Probably instead they must be equivariant sections of some rank 2. It's interesting that this Picard group of the moduli space is torsion. Is this what allows the discriminant modular form of weight 12 to have no zeros in $\mathbb{H}^2$? Thanks.","I have several basic questions about modular forms I'm having trouble figuring out looking at the literature.

2,"Questions on Prime Counting Functions, Explicit Formulas, and Related Zeta Functions","Questions on Prime Counting Functions, Explicit Formulas, and Related Zeta Functions",,"This question is related to the prime-counting functions defined in formulas (1) to (4) below $$A(x)=\sum\limits_{n=2}^x \frac{\Lambda(n)}{\log(n)^2}\tag{1}$$ $$\Pi(x)=\sum\limits_{n=2}^x \frac{\Lambda(n)}{\log(n)}\tag{2}$$ $$\psi(x)=\sum\limits_{n=1}^x\Lambda(n)\tag{3}$$ $$B(x)=\sum\limits_{n=1}^x\Lambda(n)\log(n)\tag{4}$$ where $\Pi(x)$ is Riemann's prime-power counting function and $\psi(x)$ is the second Chebyshev function.

Question (1) : What are the error bounds for $|A(x)-(li(x)-\frac{x}{\log(x)})|$ predicted by the PNT and RH? Question (2) : What are the error bounds for $|B(x)-(x\,(\log(x)-1))|$ predicted by the PNT and RH? Note the asymptotic $li(x)-\frac{x}{\log(x)}$ for the prime counting function $A(x)$ is the difference between the two most famous estimates for the asymptotic for the fundamental prime counting function $\pi(x)$ . The prime counting functions defined in (1) to (4) above are related the Riemann zeta function $\zeta(s)$ as follows. $$\int\log\zeta(s)\,ds=-s\int\limits_0^\infty A(x)\,x^{-s-1}\,ds=-\sum\limits_{n=2}^\infty\frac{\Lambda(n)}{\log(n)^2}\,n^{-s}\,,\quad\Re(s)>1\tag{12}$$ $$\log\zeta(s)=s\int\limits_0^\infty\Pi(x)\,x^{-s-1}\,ds=\sum\limits_{n=2}^\infty\frac{\Lambda(n)}{\log(n)}\,n^{-s}\,,\quad\Re(s)>1\tag{13}$$ $$\frac{\partial\,\log\zeta(s)}{\partial s}=-s\int\limits_0^\infty\psi(x)\,x^{-s-1}\,ds=-\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty\Lambda(n)\,n^{-s}\,,\quad\Re(s)>1\tag{14}$$ $$\frac{\partial^2\,\log\zeta(s)}{\partial s^2}=s\int\limits_0^\infty B(x)\,x^{-s-1}\,ds=\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty\Lambda(n)\log(n)\,n^{-s}\,,\quad\Re(s)>1\tag{15}$$ Question (3) : Is there a formula for $\int\log\zeta(s)\,ds$ that converges for $\Re(s)\le 1$ and if so, what is its definition?

Both approaches start with the first explicit formula for $\psi(x)$ defined in (17) above which uses the series representation of the final error term. Both approaches provide exactly the same result, but I'm not sure how to handle the derivation of the constant offset term $b$ for either approach. $B(x)=\int\log(x)\frac{\partial\,\psi(x)}{\partial\,x}\,dx\tag{19}$ $$B(x)=\frac{1}{2\,\pi\,\,i}\int\limits_{c-i\,\infty}^{c+i\,\infty}\frac{\partial}{\partial\,s}\left(-s\int\limits_0^\infty\psi(x)\,x^{-s-1}\,ds\right)\frac{x^s}{s}\,ds\tag{20}$$ The first approach outlined in (19) above leverages the relationship $B'(x)=\log(x)\,\psi'(x)$ from (7) above. The second approach outlined in (20) above takes advantage of the fact that all terms in the first formula for $\psi(x)$ illustrated in (17) above are of the form $a\, x^z$ and the Mellin transform of $x^z$ is $2\,\pi\,\delta(i\,(s+z))$ . I illustrated $\mathcal{M}_s^{-1}[2\,\pi\,\delta(i\,(s+z))](x)=x^z$ in the following answer I posted to a question on evaluation of $\delta(s)$ for $s\in \mathbb{C}$ . Answer to Question on Evaluation of $\delta(s)$ for $s\in \mathbb{C}$ I illustrated a single outer integral in approach 2 outlined in (20) above, but this is a bit of an oversimplification as each individual term requires a different value of $c$ for evaluation of its associated integral. Question (4) : What is the derivation and exact value for the constant offset term $b$ associated with the derived explicit formula for $B(x)$ defined in (18) above?

The approach outlined in (22) below leverages the relationship $\Pi'(x)=\log(x)\,A'(x)$ from (5) above.

March 17, 2018 Update: I believe I've determined the answer to question (4) above. I believe the constant offset term $b$ associated with the derived explicit formula for $B(x)$ defined in (18) above is $$b=\frac{\zeta''(0)}{\zeta(0)}-\frac{\zeta'(0)^2}{\zeta(0)^2}=\frac{\pi ^2}{12}-\gamma^2-2 \gamma_1=0.634921\tag{23}$$ which corresponds to the residue of $\frac{\partial^2\,\log\zeta(s)}{\partial s^2} \frac{x^s}{s}$ at $s=0$ . I more recently verified the remainder of the terms in formula (18) for $B(x)$ above are consistent with the residues of $\frac{\partial^2\,\log\zeta(s)}{\partial s^2} \frac{x^s}{s}$ at $s=1$ and the zeros of $\zeta(s)$ . In the explicit formulas defined above, the sums $\sum\limits_{\rho}\ (...)$ over the non-trivial zeta zeros are conditionally convergent and should be evaluated as $\underset{T\to\infty}{\text{lim}}\left(\sum\limits_{|\Im(\rho)|<T}\ (...)\right)$ .","This question is related to the prime-counting functions defined in formulas (1) to (4) below where is Riemann's prime-power counting function and is the second Chebyshev function.

Let $M$ be the $\Bbb{Z}$ span of $w$, so $M \subset \mathfrak{O}_K$.

We can multiply through by an integer to make the $c_k$ which is not divisible by $p$ by 1. Clearly only need to check co-efficients $0\le c_j \lt p$. If we find such an $\alpha$ with $c_k$ not equal to zero, we replace $w_k$ with our $\alpha$ to get another $\Bbb{Q}$-basis, $M'$ and our discriminant is divided by $p$. 3) We repeat with our new basis $M'$.

39,The Parseval theorem applied to 8 well known functions. Could this be extended to L-series?,The Parseval theorem applied to 8 well known functions. Could this be extended to L-series?,,"In the shaded section below, I listed 8 well-known functions that nicely hang together: $$\displaystyle\frac{\beta(s)+\lambda(s)}{\kappa(s)+\alpha(s)}=\frac{\zeta_H\left(s,\frac12\right)+\eta_H\left(s,\frac12\right)}{\zeta(s)+\eta(s)}$$ Each of these functions has a Laplace/Fourier integral transform that can be ""plugged into"" the integral from the Parseval theorem : $$\small G_f(s):=\frac{1}{\pi\,\Gamma(s+1)}\int_{0}^{\infty} f\left(\frac{s+1}{2}+x\,i\right)\Gamma\left(\frac{s+1}{2}+x\,i\right)f\left(\frac{s+1}{2}-x\,i\right)\Gamma\left(\frac{s+1}{2}-x\,i\right)dx$$ Based on the example for $f(s)=\zeta(s)$ shown here , I managed to derive the new closed forms for each of the 8 functions and also listed them in the shaded area (note: only analytically continued to $\Re(s)>0$). All closed forms $G_f(s)$ are now directly related to $\zeta(s)$ (note that f.i. $\beta(s)$ wasn't). I then found that the same nice relation remains for $s \in \mathbb{C}$ and $\Re(s)>0$, i.e: $$\displaystyle\frac{G{_\beta}(s)+G_{\lambda}(s)}{G_{\kappa}(s)+G_{\alpha}(s)}=\frac{G_{\zeta_H}\left(s,\frac12\right)+G{\eta_H}\left(s,\frac12\right)}{G_{\zeta}(s)+G_{\eta}(s)}$$ 1) Is the fact that this relation remains the same a logical consequence of applying the Parseval theorem? (note that other relations like $\zeta(s)+\eta(s)=2\lambda(s)$ or $\alpha(s)+\lambda(s)=\zeta(s)$ do break down). 2) Besides $\zeta(s)$ and sums of $\zeta_H(s)$, the $\lambda$ and the $\beta$-functions are as $L(s,\chi_{4,1})$ and $L(s,\chi_{4,2})$ respectively, the only ones related to a Dirichlet L-series . However, I could not find any further connections like these in the ""G-world"". Do closed forms for L-series (other than mod 4) also exist after applying the Parseval theorem? Addition to question 2: I believe that I have now also found a closed ""G""-form for the Dirichlet L-series . With $\chi_{_{k,\,j}}(n)$ being a Dirichlet character with modulus $k$ and index $j$, it is well known that: $$\displaystyle L(s,\,\chi_{_{k,\,j}})=\frac{1}{k^s}\sum_{n=1}^k \chi_{_{k,\,j}}(n)\cdot\zeta_H \left(s,\frac{n}{k}\right)$$ Then I defined: $$\zeta_H^*(s,a)= \zeta_H(s,2a)-(2a-1)\,\zeta_H(s+1,2a)$$ and found that: $$\displaystyle G_{L(s,\,\chi_{{k,\,j}})}=\frac{1}{k^{s+1}}\left(\sum_{n=1}^{k} \chi_{_{k,\,j}}(n)^2\cdot\zeta_H^* \left(s,\frac{n}{k}\right)+2\sum_{n=1}^{k-2}\sum_{m=n+1}^{k-1}\chi_{_{k,\,j}}(n)\cdot\chi_{_{k,\,j}}(m)\cdot\zeta_H^* \left(s,\frac{n+m}{2k}\right)\right)$$ that seems valid for $\Re(s)>-1$, except for index $j=1$, when it is valid for $\Re(s)>1$ only. The latter can be analytically continued to f.i. $0 <  \Re(s) <1$ by just subtracting from the above: $$\displaystyle \small \frac{2}{s\,k}\,\left(L(s,\,\chi_{{k,1}})+\frac{1}{k^s}\sum_{n=1}^{k-2}\sum_{m=1}^{k-n-1}\chi_{_{k,1}}(m)\cdot\chi_{_{k,1}}(m+n)\cdot\left(\zeta_H \left(s,\frac{m}{k}\right)+\zeta_H \left(s,\frac{m+n}{k}\right)\right)\right)$$ $\\$ $\\$ $\displaystyle \small \sum_{n\ge1}\frac{1}{n^s}=$ Riemann $\zeta(s)$-function $\qquad \qquad \rightarrow  \small G_\zeta(s)=  \begin{cases} \zeta(s) - \zeta(s+1) &  \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \Re(s)>1  \\   \\ \zeta(s)-\zeta(s+1)-2\,\frac{\zeta(s)}{s}&  \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad 0<\Re(s)<1  \end{cases}\\$ $\displaystyle \small \sum_{n\ge1}\frac{1}{(2n)^s}=$ Self named $\alpha(s)$-function $\small =2^{-s}\zeta(s)$   $\qquad \qquad \rightarrow \small G_\alpha(s)=  \begin{cases} \frac{1}{2^{s+1}}\big(\zeta(s)-\zeta(s+1)\big)  & \qquad \qquad \quad \quad \,\, \Re(s)>1  \\ \\  \frac{1}{2^{s+1}}\big(\zeta(s)-\zeta(s+1)\big)-\frac{\alpha(s)}{s} & \qquad \qquad \quad \quad \,\, 0<\Re(s)<1  \end{cases}\\$ $\displaystyle \small \sum_{n\ge0}\frac{1}{(2n+1)^s}=$ Dirichlet $\lambda(s)$-function $=\small (1-2^{-s})\zeta(s)$ $\qquad \qquad \rightarrow \small G_\lambda(s)=  \begin{cases} \frac{1}{2^{s+1}}\zeta(s)& \qquad \qquad \quad \qquad \qquad \qquad \,\,\, \Re(s)>1  \\ \\  \frac{1}{2^{s+1}}\zeta(s)-\frac{\lambda(s)}{s} & \qquad \qquad \qquad \quad \qquad \qquad \,\,\, 0<\Re(s)<1  \end{cases}\\$ $\displaystyle \small \sum_{n\ge 0}\frac{1}{(a+n)^s}=$ Hurwitz $\zeta_H(s,a)$-function $=\small \zeta_H\left(s,\frac12\right) = (1-2^s)\zeta(s)$ $\qquad \qquad \rightarrow \small G_{\zeta_H}(s)=   \begin{cases}  \zeta_H(s,2a)-(2a-1)\,\zeta_H(s+1,2a) &  \,\,\,\, \Re(s)>1  \\ \\  \zeta_H(s,2a)-(2a-1)\,\zeta_H(s+1,2a)-2\,\frac{\zeta_H(s,a)}{s} &  \,\,\,\, 0<\Re(s)<1  \end{cases}\\$ $\displaystyle \small \sum_{n\ge1}\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n^s}=$ Dirichlet $\eta(s)$-function $\small=(1-2^{1-s})\zeta(s)$ $\qquad \qquad \rightarrow \small G_\eta(s) = \eta(s+1)-\eta(s) \,\, \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \,\,\,\,\Re(s)>0\\$ $\displaystyle \small \sum_{n\ge1}\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{(2n)^s}=$ Self named $\kappa(s)$-function $=\small 2^{-s}\eta(s)$ $\qquad \qquad \rightarrow \small G_\kappa(s)=\frac{1}{2^{s+1}}\big(\eta(s+1)-\eta(s)\big) \qquad \qquad \qquad \quad \qquad \quad \,\,\, \Re(s)>0\\$ $\displaystyle \small \sum_{n\ge0}\frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)^s}=$ Dirichlet $\beta(s)$-function $\small =4^{-s}\big(\zeta\left(s,\frac14\right)-\zeta\left(s,\frac34\right)\big)$ $\qquad \qquad \rightarrow \small G_\beta(s) = \frac{1}{2^{s+1}}\,\eta(s) \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \quad \qquad \qquad \, \Re(s)>0\\$ $\displaystyle \small \sum_{n\ge 0}\frac{(-1)^n}{(a+n)^s}=$ Self named $\eta_H(s,a)$-function $=\small 2^{-s}\big( \zeta_{H}\left(s,\frac{a}{2}\right)-\zeta_{H}\left(s,\frac{a+1}{2}\right)\big)$ $\qquad \qquad \rightarrow \small G_{\eta_H}(s) = \eta_H(s,2a)-(2a-1)\,\eta_H(s+1,2a) \,\, \qquad \qquad \quad \,\Re(s)>0\\$","In the shaded section below, I listed 8 well-known functions that nicely hang together: $$\displaystyle\frac{\beta(s)+\lambda(s)}{\kappa(s)+\alpha(s)}=\frac{\zeta_H\left(s,\frac12\right)+\eta_H\left(s,\frac12\right)}{\zeta(s)+\eta(s)}$$ Each of these functions has a Laplace/Fourier integral transform that can be ""plugged into"" the integral from the Parseval theorem : $$\small G_f(s):=\frac{1}{\pi\,\Gamma(s+1)}\int_{0}^{\infty} f\left(\frac{s+1}{2}+x\,i\right)\Gamma\left(\frac{s+1}{2}+x\,i\right)f\left(\frac{s+1}{2}-x\,i\right)\Gamma\left(\frac{s+1}{2}-x\,i\right)dx$$ Based on the example for $f(s)=\zeta(s)$ shown here , I managed to derive the new closed forms for each of the 8 functions and also listed them in the shaded area (note: only analytically continued to $\Re(s)>0$). All closed forms $G_f(s)$ are now directly related to $\zeta(s)$ (note that f.i. $\beta(s)$ wasn't). I then found that the same nice relation remains for $s \in \mathbb{C}$ and $\Re(s)>0$, i.e: $$\displaystyle\frac{G{_\beta}(s)+G_{\lambda}(s)}{G_{\kappa}(s)+G_{\alpha}(s)}=\frac{G_{\zeta_H}\left(s,\frac12\right)+G{\eta_H}\left(s,\frac12\right)}{G_{\zeta}(s)+G_{\eta}(s)}$$ 1) Is the fact that this relation remains the same a logical consequence of applying the Parseval theorem? (note that other relations like $\zeta(s)+\eta(s)=2\lambda(s)$ or $\alpha(s)+\lambda(s)=\zeta(s)$ do break down). 2) Besides $\zeta(s)$ and sums of $\zeta_H(s)$, the $\lambda$ and the $\beta$-functions are as $L(s,\chi_{4,1})$ and $L(s,\chi_{4,2})$ respectively, the only ones related to a Dirichlet L-series . However, I could not find any further connections like these in the ""G-world"". Do closed forms for L-series (other than mod 4) also exist after applying the Parseval theorem? Addition to question 2: I believe that I have now also found a closed ""G""-form for the Dirichlet L-series . With $\chi_{_{k,\,j}}(n)$ being a Dirichlet character with modulus $k$ and index $j$, it is well known that: $$\displaystyle L(s,\,\chi_{_{k,\,j}})=\frac{1}{k^s}\sum_{n=1}^k \chi_{_{k,\,j}}(n)\cdot\zeta_H \left(s,\frac{n}{k}\right)$$ Then I defined: $$\zeta_H^*(s,a)= \zeta_H(s,2a)-(2a-1)\,\zeta_H(s+1,2a)$$ and found that: $$\displaystyle G_{L(s,\,\chi_{{k,\,j}})}=\frac{1}{k^{s+1}}\left(\sum_{n=1}^{k} \chi_{_{k,\,j}}(n)^2\cdot\zeta_H^* \left(s,\frac{n}{k}\right)+2\sum_{n=1}^{k-2}\sum_{m=n+1}^{k-1}\chi_{_{k,\,j}}(n)\cdot\chi_{_{k,\,j}}(m)\cdot\zeta_H^* \left(s,\frac{n+m}{2k}\right)\right)$$ that seems valid for $\Re(s)>-1$, except for index $j=1$, when it is valid for $\Re(s)>1$ only. The latter can be analytically continued to f.i. $0 <  \Re(s) <1$ by just subtracting from the above: $$\displaystyle \small \frac{2}{s\,k}\,\left(L(s,\,\chi_{{k,1}})+\frac{1}{k^s}\sum_{n=1}^{k-2}\sum_{m=1}^{k-n-1}\chi_{_{k,1}}(m)\cdot\chi_{_{k,1}}(m+n)\cdot\left(\zeta_H \left(s,\frac{m}{k}\right)+\zeta_H \left(s,\frac{m+n}{k}\right)\right)\right)$$ $\\$ $\\$ $\displaystyle \small \sum_{n\ge1}\frac{1}{n^s}=$ Riemann $\zeta(s)$-function $\qquad \qquad \rightarrow  \small G_\zeta(s)=  \begin{cases} \zeta(s) - \zeta(s+1) &  \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \Re(s)>1  \\   \\ \zeta(s)-\zeta(s+1)-2\,\frac{\zeta(s)}{s}&  \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad 0<\Re(s)<1  \end{cases}\\$ $\displaystyle \small \sum_{n\ge1}\frac{1}{(2n)^s}=$ Self named $\alpha(s)$-function $\small =2^{-s}\zeta(s)$   $\qquad \qquad \rightarrow \small G_\alpha(s)=  \begin{cases} \frac{1}{2^{s+1}}\big(\zeta(s)-\zeta(s+1)\big)  & \qquad \qquad \quad \quad \,\, \Re(s)>1  \\ \\  \frac{1}{2^{s+1}}\big(\zeta(s)-\zeta(s+1)\big)-\frac{\alpha(s)}{s} & \qquad \qquad \quad \quad \,\, 0<\Re(s)<1  \end{cases}\\$ $\displaystyle \small \sum_{n\ge0}\frac{1}{(2n+1)^s}=$ Dirichlet $\lambda(s)$-function $=\small (1-2^{-s})\zeta(s)$ $\qquad \qquad \rightarrow \small G_\lambda(s)=  \begin{cases} \frac{1}{2^{s+1}}\zeta(s)& \qquad \qquad \quad \qquad \qquad \qquad \,\,\, \Re(s)>1  \\ \\  \frac{1}{2^{s+1}}\zeta(s)-\frac{\lambda(s)}{s} & \qquad \qquad \qquad \quad \qquad \qquad \,\,\, 0<\Re(s)<1  \end{cases}\\$ $\displaystyle \small \sum_{n\ge 0}\frac{1}{(a+n)^s}=$ Hurwitz $\zeta_H(s,a)$-function $=\small \zeta_H\left(s,\frac12\right) = (1-2^s)\zeta(s)$ $\qquad \qquad \rightarrow \small G_{\zeta_H}(s)=   \begin{cases}  \zeta_H(s,2a)-(2a-1)\,\zeta_H(s+1,2a) &  \,\,\,\, \Re(s)>1  \\ \\  \zeta_H(s,2a)-(2a-1)\,\zeta_H(s+1,2a)-2\,\frac{\zeta_H(s,a)}{s} &  \,\,\,\, 0<\Re(s)<1  \end{cases}\\$ $\displaystyle \small \sum_{n\ge1}\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n^s}=$ Dirichlet $\eta(s)$-function $\small=(1-2^{1-s})\zeta(s)$ $\qquad \qquad \rightarrow \small G_\eta(s) = \eta(s+1)-\eta(s) \,\, \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \,\,\,\,\Re(s)>0\\$ $\displaystyle \small \sum_{n\ge1}\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{(2n)^s}=$ Self named $\kappa(s)$-function $=\small 2^{-s}\eta(s)$ $\qquad \qquad \rightarrow \small G_\kappa(s)=\frac{1}{2^{s+1}}\big(\eta(s+1)-\eta(s)\big) \qquad \qquad \qquad \quad \qquad \quad \,\,\, \Re(s)>0\\$ $\displaystyle \small \sum_{n\ge0}\frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)^s}=$ Dirichlet $\beta(s)$-function $\small =4^{-s}\big(\zeta\left(s,\frac14\right)-\zeta\left(s,\frac34\right)\big)$ $\qquad \qquad \rightarrow \small G_\beta(s) = \frac{1}{2^{s+1}}\,\eta(s) \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \quad \qquad \qquad \, \Re(s)>0\\$ $\displaystyle \small \sum_{n\ge 0}\frac{(-1)^n}{(a+n)^s}=$ Self named $\eta_H(s,a)$-function $=\small 2^{-s}\big( \zeta_{H}\left(s,\frac{a}{2}\right)-\zeta_{H}\left(s,\frac{a+1}{2}\right)\big)$ $\qquad \qquad \rightarrow \small G_{\eta_H}(s) = \eta_H(s,2a)-(2a-1)\,\eta_H(s+1,2a) \,\, \qquad \qquad \quad \,\Re(s)>0\\$",,"['sequences-and-series', 'number-theory', 'riemann-zeta', 'integral-transforms', 'dirichlet-series']"
40,Counting lattice points to get results on prime density?,Counting lattice points to get results on prime density?,,"Given a positive integer $n$ , the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation $x^2+y^2=n$ depends only on the prime factorization of $n$ . In particular, only divisors which are congruent to $1\pmod 4$ will increase the number of solutions. This is because these are the primes splitting in $\mathbb{Q}(i)/\mathbb{Q}$ and the norm map sends $x+iy$ to $x^2+y^2$ . So we can read all of this information off of the coefficients of the corresponding Dedekind zeta function. Gauss's circle problem instead asks for the number of lattice points inside a circle of radius $n$ centered at the origin, so this is just summing the first $n$ coefficients of the zeta function (and multiplying by 4 to allow negative numbers. Probably I should be more careful about 0, but we're at least very close). Of course we have a decent approximation for the answer to this problem, there should be about $\pi n^2$ lattice points in the circle. Side question 1) This implies that the average coefficient of the zeta function for $\mathbb{Q}(i)$ is $\pi/4$ . Do we expect the average coefficient of general zeta functions/L functions to have some nice interpretation? Side question 2) It seems like it should be somewhat annoying but not too hard to combine these two paragraphs to show that there are infinitely many primes $1\pmod 4$ and even to get a decent approximation of the number of such primes less than a given $N$ . I know the usual proof of Dirichlet's theorem and realize this isn't so different, but it seems like the lattice counting point of view should give a different approach. Main question) How much does the above generalize? Ie, for which polynomials $f(x_1,...,x_k)$ does counting lattice points inside $f(x_1,...,x_k)=n$ as $n$ varies give information about the densities of certain primes? Conversely, which sets of prime numbers are counted by some polynomial, and does this lead to more regular behavior of these primes than we might expect? I have a few guesses about this but nothing very solid. I'd guess that polynomials arising from norm maps of number fields would tell you about the splitting of primes in that number field, so abelian extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$ would tell you about primes in specific arithmetic progressions (or sums of arithmetic progressions). I've read the book Primes of the Form $x^2+ny^2$ , so I have some idea that if the class number is greater than 1 things will get hairy, but I still hope there are some results for such fields - maybe looking at multiple polynomials at once to cover different genera?","Given a positive integer , the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation depends only on the prime factorization of .

So if we have an even weak upper bound on the coefficients on the continued fraction of an algebraic number we can solve lots of diophantine equations using approximation arguments. I think even something ridiculous like $$\alpha=[a_0;a_1\dots]\implies a_n < e^{e^{e^n}}$$ for some known algebraic $\alpha$ might prove useful. It looks like such a statement should be easy to prove but unfortunately I don't have anything so far.","Let $$2^{1/3}=a_0+\frac{1}{a_1+\dots}$$ be the canonical continued fraction of $2^{1/3}$. It is relatively easy to prove that if $a_n<10\phi^n$ then the equation $x^3-2y^3=1$ has no nontrivial integer solutions (this equation has no solutions anyway, but it would be an interesting alternative, and relatively easy, proof). The first few terms actually are: $2^{1/3}= $[1; 3, 1, 5, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 8, 1, 14, 1, 10, 2, 1, 4, 12, 2, 3, 2, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 2, 14, 3, 12, 1, 15, 3, 1, 4, 534, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 121, 1, 2, 2, 4, 10, 3,

Is it possible to use up to $n$ consecutive values to potentially identify $p(x)$ as irreducible over the set of integer-valued polynomials? I managed to prove that for $n=2$ there is a definite upper limit for the 3rd sequential value, but it is very difficult for higher degrees, even with induction.  I encountered this question while considering some primes appearing in polynomial sequences.  I have attempted to use Lagrange interpolation and binomial forms and I haven't made any progress past $n=2$. Here is a sketch for the proof that there is an upper bound for the described polynomial with $n=2$: We have fixed positive integers $v_1,v_2, v_1\le v_2$ and polynomial in binomial form $$p(x) = a{x\choose 2}+(v_2-v_1)x+v_1$$ (Notice that we have set $p(0) = v_1,p(1) = v_2$.)  Since we have $n=2$, we must have $p(2) = v_3$ for whatever positive integer value $v_3$ takes on, which means that we have $p(2) = a + 2v_2-v_1 = v_3$, and so we have $a = v_3-2v_2+v_1$ (which is correct by Finite Difference theory), giving us $$p(x) = (v_3-2v_2+v_1){x\choose 2}+(v_2-v_1)x+v_1$$ This shows that only the (binomial-form) quadratic term will change in coefficient as $v_3$ changes.  Now consider this value: $$p\left(\frac 12\right)=\frac 14v_1+v_2-\frac 14v_3$$ We again have linear change in the value at this point as $v_3$ changes, and it is clear that it is possible for this value to be negative. If $p(x)$ is composite with at least two non-constant integer-valued polynomial factors, and if $v_3$ is large enough to force $p\left(\frac 12\right)$ to be negative, then these factors are based exactly on the roots between $p(0)$ and $p(1)$, since each of these values is positive.  So we would have $$p(x) = (v_3-2v_2+v_1)(x-q_0)(x-q_1)=a(x-q_0)\cdot b(x-q_1)$$ In order for these factors to be considered ""integer-valued"", both $a$ and $b$ must be large enough that either the denominator of the rational $aq_0\le 2$ or the denominator of the rational $bq_1\le 2$.  (For example, ${x\choose 2}={x(x-1)\over 2}$ and these factors are considered ""integer-valued"".)  But we also notice that $q_0$ must be between $0$ and the intersection $(Q_0,0)$ of the line $y=0$ with the line segment connecting $(0,p(0))$ with $\left(\frac 12,p\left(\frac 12\right)\right)$, and this distance $Q_0$ is inverse-linear with $v_3$ (by similar triangles).  But this means that $a$ must be asymptotically linear with $v_3$ and also (by the same argument for $Q_1$) that $b$ must be asymptotically linear with $v_3$, and therefore that $$p(x) = (v_3-2v_2+v_1)(x-q_0)(x-q_1)=cv_3^2(x-q_0)(x-q_1)\tag 1$$ But $v_3$ is allowed to take on any value, and equation $(1)$ implies that $c$ must vary inverse-linearly with $v_3$, therefore there exists $N\in\Bbb N$ such that for all $v_3\gt N$ at least one of $a(x-q_0),b(x-q_1)$ cannot be integer-valued.
