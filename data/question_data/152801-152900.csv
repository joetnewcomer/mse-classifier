Now, I gather that these sums are called ""harmonic numbers"" if the consecutive sequence begins with 1.  But what if it doesn't begin with 1?

I have tried to explain it very detailed so anyone, even with a little knowledge of elementary number theory (like me), can follow the steps. $n=0$ and $n=1$ are solutions. It is known that for a natural number $n>1$ with prime factorization of $\prod_{i=1}^{k} p_i^{a_i}$ arithmetic derivative is $$n'=n \sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{a_i}{p_i}. \tag{1}$$ Let $m=n'$, then equation becomes $m'=m$. Let prime factorization of $m$ be $\prod_{j=1}^{l} q_j^{b_j}$. Then from equation $(1)$ we get $$\frac{b_1}{q_1}+ \frac{b_2}{q_2}+... + \frac{b_l}{q_l}=1. \tag{2}$$ This equation implies that $q_j \ge b_j$. Multiply both sides of the equation $(2)$ by $q_1 q_2 ... q_{l-1}$. It follows that $q_1 q_2 ... q_{l-1}\frac{b_l}{q_l}$ is an integer. Thus $q_l | b_l$. Hence $b_l \ge q_l$ and $b_l=q_l$. Subsequently $b_1=b_2=...=b_{l-1}=0$ and $m=q^q$ for some prime number $q$. Thus we have $n'=m=q^q$ and $n\sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{a_i}{p_i}=q^q$ or $$\prod_{i=1}^{k} p_i^{a_i-1}\sum_{i=1}^{k} \left( p_1 p_2 ... p_k \frac{a_i}{p_i} \right)=q^q. \tag{3}$$ Notice that if $p_i \neq q$ is a prime divisor of $n$, then $a_i=1$.

Now its easy to see from equation $(3)$ that $a \le q$ and dividing both sides of it by $q^{a-1}$ gives $$q\sum_{i=1}^{k} \left( \frac{p_1 p_2 ... p_k}{p_i} \right)+p_1 p_2 ... p_k a=q^{q-a+1}.$$Therefore, $q|a$, which leads to $a \ge q$ and $q=a$. Thus $$\sum_{i=1}^{k} \left( \frac{p_1 p_2 ... p_k}{p_i} \right)+p_1 p_2 ... p_k=1,$$Which is a contradiction and $n=q^q$.

29,Can someone explain the ABC conjecture to me?,Can someone explain the ABC conjecture to me?,,"I am an undergrad and I know that the conjecture may have been proven recently. But in reading about it, I am entirely confused as to what it means and why it is important. I was hoping some of you kind people could help me. I know there are several formulations of the conjecture. Wolfram says: for any infinitesimal $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a constant $C_\epsilon$ such that for any three relatively prime integers $a$, $b$, $c$ satisfying $a+b=c$ the inequality $$\max (|a|, |b|, |c|) \leq C_{\epsilon}\displaystyle\prod_{p|abc} p^{1+\epsilon}$$ holds, where $p|abc$ indicates that the product is over primes $p$ which divide the product $abc$. Then Wikipedia says: For a positive integer $n$, the radical of $n$, denoted $\text{rad}(n)$, is the product of the distinct prime factors of $n$. If $a$, $b$, and $c$ are coprime positive integers such that $a + b = c$, it turns out that ""usually"" $c < \text{rad}(abc)$. The abc conjecture deals with the exceptions. Specifically, it states that for every $\epsilon>0$ there exist only finitely many triples $(a,b,c)$ of positive coprime integers with $a + b = c$ such that $$c>\text{rad}(abc)^{1+\epsilon}$$ An equivalent formulation states that for any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a constant $K$ such that, for all triples of coprime positive integers $(a, b, c)$ satisfying $a + b = c$, the inequality $$c<K\cdot\text{rad}(abc)^{1+\epsilon}$$ holds.

But in reading about it, I am entirely confused as to what it means and why it is important. I was hoping some of you kind people could help me.

Wolfram says: for any infinitesimal $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a constant $C_\epsilon$ such that for any three relatively prime integers $a$, $b$, $c$ satisfying $a+b=c$ the inequality $$\max (|a|, |b|, |c|) \leq C_{\epsilon}\displaystyle\prod_{p|abc} p^{1+\epsilon}$$ holds, where $p|abc$ indicates that the product is over primes $p$ which divide the product $abc$. Then Wikipedia says: For a positive integer $n$, the radical of $n$, denoted $\text{rad}(n)$, is the product of the distinct prime factors of $n$.

I ask: Are there unique solutions for $n=\sum_\limits{j=1}^{g(k)} a_j^k$ , with $a_u\neq a_v \geq0 \; , \; \forall u\neq v$ ? $g(k)$ being the minimum number $s$ of $k$ th powers needed to represent all integers. $14$ would be an example of a unique decomposition (into $0^2+1^2+2^2+3^2$ ). Non-unique decompositions for $k=2$ can be constructed by letting $ n=(a_0+x)^2+\sum_\limits{j=1}^3 a_j^2$ and $a_0=x+\sum_\limits{j=1}^3 a_j$ . Robert gave a formula for cubes below . So another question is: How can one test that a certain $n$ has a unique solution, or even better how can I calculate the number of respresentations? As Gerry points out in his comment , a prime $p=4k+1\;$ has a unique representation $p=a^2+b^2$ with $0<a<b\;$ ( Thue's Lemma ). Partial answer for $k=2$ (from here ) The sequence of positive integers whose representation as a sum of four squares is unique is: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 14, 15, 23, 24, 32, 56, 96, 128, 224... (sequence A006431 in OEIS). These integers consist of the seven odd numbers $1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 15, 23$ and all numbers of the form $2 × 4^k, 6 × 4^k$ or $14 × 4^k$ . Partial , therefore, because $23=1^2+2^2+2\times 3^2$ ( answer , because $14\times 4^k$ is unique). Another way to look at it, uses ${g(k)}$ -dimensional vector spaces $V$ over $\mathbb N_0^+$ that are provided with an $k$ -norm $||a||_k=\left( \sum_\limits{j=1}^{g(k)} a_j^k \right)^{1/k}$ and the additional conditions that $a_u\neq a_v \geq0 \; , \; \forall u\neq v$ . Now there is a set of length-preserving operations $U_p$ , that transforms vectors, from a defined range $\mathcal R (U_p)$ . An example operation was shown above.

53,Proof that the ratio between the logs of the product and LCM of the Fibonacci numbers converges to $\frac{\pi^2}{6}$,Proof that the ratio between the logs of the product and LCM of the Fibonacci numbers converges to,\frac{\pi^2}{6},"I came across this amazing fact on Twitter . $$\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{\log\left(F_1 \cdots F_n\right)}{\log \text{LCM}\left(F_1, \ldots,  F_n\right)} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}$$ where $F_i$ is the $i$ th Fibonacci number and LCM = Least Common Multiple. This is such an interesting link between the Fibonacci numbers (which are closely linked to the Golden Ratio $\varphi$ ) and $\pi$ . I'm trying to prove why this is the case.

What I'm wondering is, how to prove that this will be the case? Some relevant tools might be that $$\prod_i \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_i^2}\right) = \frac{6}{\pi^2}$$ , where $p_i$ is the $i$ th prime. Also, it's not hard to show that the LCM of the first $n$ natural numbers is roughly $e^n$ .

57,Analysis of a combinatorial game with prime numbers,Analysis of a combinatorial game with prime numbers,,"Many years ago, a coworker showed me a programming problem involving a combinatorial game with prime numbers that he had gotten somewhere or other.  (For some reason, he refused to tell me the source.)   Actually it is an infinite family of games, depending on an integer $N \ge 2.$  The first player names some prime $p_1 \le N.$  Then the second player names some prime $p_1 <p_2 \le p_1+N.$  The game continues in this manner.  Whenever a player names a prime $p_k,$ his opponent  must name a prime $p_k <p_{k+1}\le p_k+N.$  The first player who is unable to name a prime loses.  Of course, we assume that the players have unlimited tables of the primes available. The programming problem is to write a function that will take $N$ as input and produce as output the prime that the first player should say on his first move in order to win, or $0$ if there is no such prime.  It's easy to see what the optimum strategy is.  Let $\pi_1$ be the smallest prime such that $\pi_1+k \text{ is composite } k=1,2,\cdots,N.$  Then the player who names $\pi_1$ wins.  Then then $\pi_2$ be that largest prime such that $\pi_2 <\pi_1-N.$  Then the player who names $\pi_2$ wins.  However, this is completely impractical, because even for rather small values of $N,$ $\pi_1$ is enormous. Another friend and I solved the problem by starting from $2$ and going forward, rather than trying to go backwards from $\pi_1.$  For each prime $p$, we pretend that the goal of the game is to name $p$ and we label $p$ with the first move necessary to name it.  For $p\le N,$ the label is just $p$.  Then working through the primes, we label each $p$ with the label of the largest prime less than $p-N$.  So for example, if $N=23,$ we label the primes up through $23$ with themselves, and then we label $29$ with the label of the largest prime less than $29-23,$  that is $5.$  Then we label $31$ with $7$ and $37$ with $13$.

(For some reason, he refused to tell me the source.)   Actually it is an infinite family of games, depending on an integer $N \ge 2.$  The first player names some prime $p_1 \le N.$  Then the second player names some prime $p_1 <p_2 \le p_1+N.$  The game continues in this manner.  Whenever a player names a prime $p_k,$ his opponent  must name a prime $p_k <p_{k+1}\le p_k+N.$  The first player who is unable to name a prime loses.  Of course, we assume that the players have unlimited tables of the primes available. The programming problem is to write a function that will take $N$ as input and produce as output the prime that the first player should say on his first move in order to win, or $0$ if there is no such prime.  It's easy to see what the optimum strategy is.  Let $\pi_1$ be the smallest prime such that $\pi_1+k \text{ is composite } k=1,2,\cdots,N.$  Then the player who names $\pi_1$ wins.  Then then $\pi_2$ be that largest prime such that $\pi_2 <\pi_1-N.$  Then the player who names $\pi_2$ wins.  However, this is completely impractical, because even for rather small values of $N,$ $\pi_1$ is enormous. Another friend and I solved the problem by starting from $2$ and going forward, rather than trying to go backwards from $\pi_1.$  For each prime $p$, we pretend that the goal of the game is to name $p$ and we label $p$ with the first move necessary to name it.  For $p\le N,$ the label is just $p$.  Then working through the primes, we label each $p$ with the label of the largest prime less than $p-N$.  So for example, if $N=23,$ we label the primes up through $23$ with themselves, and then we label $29$ with the label of the largest prime less than $29-23,$  that is $5.$  Then we label $31$ with $7$ and $37$ with $13$.  Later on, when we come to label $61,$ it gets the same label as $37,$ namely $13.$ What we find as we fill out the table is that we rather quickly get to an interval $I$ of length $N$ in which all the primes have the same label.

As of now, I haven't seen any substantive references online to nephroids and the Collatz conjecture together . A post here describes how you can generate a cardioid in polar coordinates by drawing lines between evenly spaced points on a circle, but this doesn't relate to the Collatz sequences, and doesn't construct a nephroid. Update: Based on the discussion, the cardioid can be generated based on the envelope of lines drawn between points around a circle, with each line drawn between point line between points n and 2n (mod N), as described here . The nephroid is based on the same concept for points between n and 3n, as described here . The Collatz sequence contains both behaviors: some elements in sequence follow 2n->n (the order of the two doesn't matter if we are connecting lines), and some elements follow n->3n+1 (but the +1 component is negligible for the overall shape), resulting in the cardioid and nephroid. Update #2: Per a suggestion by heropup below, I've redrawn the image where for each line connecting terms (N,N+1) in a sequence, the line is red if N+1 > N and blue if N+1 < N.

On the other hand, (4) implies that it cannot be positive either, so it is $0$ and we have $a=q-1$ and therefore $$p=q^2-q+1.\tag{8}$$ Now, substituting (8) in (1) and evaluating modulo $q^2$ gives $-3q+1\equiv1\pmod{q^2}$, i.e. $q^2$ divides $3q$ which forces $q=3$ and $p=7$.","In If $p,q$ are prime, solve $p^3-q^5=(p+q)^2$. , the author asks to solve the equation $p^3-q^5=(p+q)^2$ for primes $p$ and $q$.

97,Is there an elementary proof that $\sum_{n=1}^\infty {1\over n^s\{n\pi\}}<\infty$ for some $s>0$?,Is there an elementary proof that  for some ?,\sum_{n=1}^\infty {1\over n^s\{n\pi\}}<\infty s>0,"Edit: David Speyer's answer made me realize a couple of things and I would like to clarify. Sorry if the length of this is getting out of hand. First, it is now clear that no estimate can be obtained for $\sigma(\alpha)$ without also obtaining an estimate for the irrationality measure of $\alpha$. This means that any technique used to estimate $\sigma(\alpha)$ can be translated into a technique for estimating the irrationality measure, and so it will not be any simpler as I'd hoped. Still, I wonder if there are any techniques that seem natural for estimating $\sigma(\alpha)$ (such as series transformations) that would not seem natural without introducing the series. For instance, though I'm sure it can be reasoned through directly, I would not have thought that the formula for the abscissa of convergence I referred to at the bottom in $(3)$ would provide an estimate for irrationality measure. Thus I suppose I'm still looking for a way to approach convergence of the series that does not involve simply obtaining a term-wise estimate (which would essentially be bounding the irrationality measure first). If you think this is a fool's errand, I'd certainly like to hear that as well. Second (and this might merit its own question if I can't resolve it), in light of David's answer I wonder if anything more can be said about the relationship between $\sigma(\alpha)$ and the irrationality measure. Can they ever be different? If so: We know that the irrationality measure of an algebraic number is $2$; are there any examples where we can explicitly compute $\sigma(\alpha)$? Finally, a minor correction to the definitions: What I've been calling $\mu(\alpha)$ is actually the irrationality measure of $\alpha$ minus one. I want to avoid getting caught up in trivial details so let me just redefine $\mu(\alpha)$ to be the least upper bound of the set of all exponents $s>0$ such that $\{n\alpha\} \geq n^{-s}$ for all but finitely many $s$. Everything below should remain the same. Original Question For $x\in\mathbb R$, let $\{x\} = x-\lfloor x\rfloor$ be the fractional part of $x$. I'm searching for an elementary proof that there exists a positive real number $s$ such that $$ \sum_{n = 1}^\infty {1\over n^s\{n\pi\}}<\infty. \tag{1} $$ The problem is certainly resolved by invoking the finite irrationality measure of $\pi$. It is known that $$ \{n\pi\} \geq {1\over n^8} \tag{2} $$ for all but finitely many integers $n$. (See the MathOverflow question numbers with known irrationality measure for references.) This implies that $(1)$ converges for $s>9$. But the proof of $(2)$ is very involved. There are other larger bounds on the irrationality measure of $\pi$ that have been known for longer and are probably easier to prove. But finite irrationality measure, while sufficient, does not seem necessary to ensure convergence of $(1)$. So I'm wondering if there isn't a qualitative way to prove that $(1)$ converges for some $s$ (no need to give an explicit $s$). While I say I seek an elementary proof, I'll settle for a proof that doesn't rely on explicit computation of irrationality measure. The choice of $\pi$ is somewhat arbitrary—I made that choice to give a sense of concreteness to the problem. Perhaps a more general framework for the question is as follows. For irrational $\alpha$, define $\sigma(\alpha)$ to be the abscissa of convergence for the Dirichlet series $$ \sum_{n = 1}^\infty {1\over n^s\{n\alpha\}}. $$ Clearly $\sigma(\alpha)\geq 1$ in all circumstances. If $\alpha$ has irrationality measure $\mu(\alpha)$, then $\sigma(\alpha)\leq \mu(\alpha) + 1$ (since then $(2)$ holds with $\alpha$ in place of $\pi$ and $\mu(\alpha)+\epsilon$ in place of the exponent $8$ for any $\epsilon>0$). But it's conceivable that $\sigma(\alpha)$ could be much less than $\mu(\alpha)+1$. Indeed, this seems likely: If $s > 1$ and $n_1,n_2,n_3,\dots$ is a sequence of integers such that $\{n_i\alpha\}\leq n_i^{-s}$, then the numbers $n_i$ must grow very fast. [ Edit: As David Speyer's answer indicates this is clearly foolish!] Note: According to the Wikipedia page on general Dirichlet series , the abscissa $\sigma(\alpha)$ is given by \begin{align*} \sigma(\alpha) = \limsup_{n\to\infty}{\log{\left({1\over\{\alpha\}}+\cdots+{1\over\{n\alpha\}}\right)}\over\log{n}}.\tag{3} \end{align*} I just now found this formula, so I haven't yet played with it.

Let $K/\mathbb{Q}$ be a number field of degree $n$ with Galois group $G$. Let $\beta = \{y_1, \dots, y_n\}$ be an ordered basis for $\mathcal{O}_K$ over $\mathbb{Z}$. The norm $N_\beta(x_1, \dots, x_n) := N_{K/\mathbb{Q}}(x_1y_1 + \dots + x_ny_n)$ is a homogemeous polynomial in $x_1, \dots, x_n$; it is invariant under the action of $G$, hence its coefficients lie in $\mathbb{Q} \cap \mathcal{O}_K = \mathbb{Z}$. Of course $N_\beta$ depends on $\beta$. For instance, picking the basis $\{1, i\}$ of $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ yields the usual form $x_1^2+x_2^2$, but picking the basis $\{1,1+i\}$ yields the form $(x_1+x_2)^2+x_2^2$. Two forms which come from the same algebraic number ring are related by the action of $\text{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$, by $N_\beta(\mathbb{x}) = N_{g\cdot \beta}(g\cdot \mathbb{x})$ where $\mathbb x = (x_1, \dots, x_n)$. Thus, to each number field $K$, we can associate canonically the homogeneous form $N_\beta(\mathbb x)$, up to the action of $\text{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$. The form $N_\beta(\mathbb x)$ satisfies some pretty cool properties: It splits as a product of linear forms over $K$ (by definition of the norm!), hence the affine variety $V$ defined by $N_\beta=0$ over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ is a union of $n$ hyperplanes. It is nonzero on ${\mathbb{Q}^*}^n$, because $y_1, \dots, y_n$ are algebraically independent over $\mathbb{Q}$. It satisfies a ""multiplicative identity"" such as the Brahmagupta–Fibonacci identity , which reflects in a naive way the multiplicative structure of $K$. Is there a way to pick out these forms easily? In general, what can be said of the classification of homogemeous forms of degree $n$ in $n$ variables over $\mathbb{Z}$?
