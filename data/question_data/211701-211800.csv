2,Study if a tree represents a tautological proposition,Study if a tree represents a tautological proposition,,"I have difficulties to solve this excercise: The following path of a given tree in customary infix notation: $$[(\neg(p\wedge q)\Rightarrow r)\wedge ((r\vee q)\Rightarrow s)]$$ represents a tautological proposition (do not make truth table). It is not possible to go through the 1) tree in preorder. For the first one, I don't know why there is the data of how the tree is traversed (usual infix notation): is it because it is the classical (or only) way to reduce a complex proposition in classical logic? Because with another notation it is not valid (as it says in point 2., which I think is true). However, it is clear that 1. is not a tautology, because if $q$ is true and $s$ is false, the expression is false. So this excercise is solved like this, or do we have to apply logical laws?: $$\begin{matrix} (\neg(p\wedge q)\Rightarrow r)\wedge ((r\vee q)\Rightarrow s)&\underbrace{\Leftrightarrow}_{\textrm{Conditional equiv.}\\\;\;\textrm{and involution}}\\ ((p\wedge q)\vee r)\wedge (\neg (r\vee q)\vee s)&\underbrace{\Leftrightarrow}_{\textrm{De Morgan}}\\ ((p\wedge q)\vee r)\wedge ((\neg r\wedge \neg q)\vee s)&\underbrace{\Leftrightarrow}_{\textrm{Distributive}}\\ (p\vee r)\wedge (q\vee r)\wedge (\neg r\vee s)\wedge (\neg q\vee s),& \end{matrix}$$ but from here I do not know how to continue. For the second I made the tree path: Looking at the graph the preorder path would be $$\wedge\Rightarrow\neg\wedge pqr\Rightarrow\vee rqs,$$ and this in logic does not represent anything; it has no meaning, therefore we can't go through the tree in preorder.

7,Moser invariant curves in discrete dynamical systems and how they give stability,Moser invariant curves in discrete dynamical systems and how they give stability,,"I have seen a theorem which says that under certain hypothesis, given an elliptic fixed point $P$ for particular discrete dynamical systems ($X_{k+1}=S(X_k)$ with $S$ a conservative diffeomorphism not depending on time), there are invariant curves for every neighborhood of $P$ called Moser curves. Then it is concluded that if I have these curves, then the point is stable. I don't understand something though. If I consider the region between two such invariant curves, why should the internal points into internal points of the image? I mean, the boundary given by these curves stays the same because of invariance, but why does the interior points get mapped to interior points? If I had a continous dynamical system I could say that every solution would be bound to stay in that set because otherwise it should pass through a Moser curve, violating the uniqueness of solution.

So we get a new list $l_{2n-1}$ with $2n-1$ terms. For example, if $n=7$, we write the numbers $$1,\ 2,\ 3,\ 4,\ 5,\ 6,\ 7,\ 8,\ 9,\ 10,\ 11,\ 12,\ 13,\ 14$$ Now, we choose two numbers at random, say $6$ and $11$. Now, $\vert6-11\vert=5$. So we remove $6$ and $11$ from the list and add $5$ in it (despite the fact that there is already a $5$). So the new list (with one less number of terms than the previous list) is $$1,\ 2,\ 3,\ 4,\ 5,\ 7,\ 8,\ 9,\ 10,\ 12,\ 13,\ 14,\ 5$$ Now the problem is to prove that given an odd number $n$ and the starting list $1,\ 2,\ 3,\dots,\ 2n$, if we go on doing the above procedure iteratively on each new list, we always reach an odd number i.e. $l_1$ contains just one term which is always an odd number. Now by studying proof theory, I have concluded that this theorem can be proved by contradiction. I can suppose that the value of $l_1$ is an even number and then backtrack to reach a contradiction to the hypothesis. But I don't know how to do it. Should I keep track of the parities of each number removed or added to the list (which is a difficult thing) or should I just stick to the parity of the end result (which I know is odd but can't prove it).

This is from Class Note from 6.042 ocw courses at MIT: ""Well Ordering Principle"" section: You can read the original here at page 1 and 2; Well Ordering Principle: http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/readings/MIT6_042JF10_chap03.pdf In fact, looking back, we took the Well Ordering Principle for granted   in proving that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational. That   proof assumed that for any positive integers $m$ and $n$, the fraction $\frac{m}{n}$   can be written in lowest terms, that is, in the form $\frac{m'}{n'}$ where $m'$   and $n'$ are positive integers with no common factors. How do we know   this is always possible? Suppose to the contrary that there were $m$, $n$ in $\mathbb{Z}^+$ such that the fraction $\frac{m}{n}$ cannot be written in lowest   terms. Now let $C$ be the set of positive integers that are numerators   of such fractions. Then $m$ in $C$, so $C$ is nonempty. Therefore, by Well   Ordering, there must be a smallest integer, $m_0$ in $C$. So by definition of   $C$, there is an integer $n_0 > 0$ such that the fraction $\frac{m_0}{n_0}$ cannot be   written in lowest terms. This means that $m_0$ and $n_0$ must have a common   factor, $p > 1$. But $(\frac{m_0}{p}) / (\frac{n_0}{p}) = \frac{m_0}{n_0}$ so any way of expressing the left hand fraction in lowest terms would   also work for $\frac{m_0}{n_0}$, which implies the fraction($\frac{m_0}{p}) / (\frac{n_0}{p})$ cannot be in written in lowest terms either. So by definition of $C$, the numerator, $\frac{m_0}{p}$, is in $C$. But $\frac{m_0}{p} < m_0$,   which contradicts the fact that $m_0$ is the smallest element of $C$. Since   the assumption that $C$ is nonempty leads to a contradiction, it follows   that $C$ must be empty. That is, that there are no numerators of   fractions that can’t be written in lowest terms, and hence there are   no such fractions at all. I don't really understand the part where, the author says: This means that $m_0$ and $n_0$ must have a common factor, $p > 1$ . BECAUSE $\frac {m_0}  {n_0}$ is a irreducible fraction, both $m_0$ and $n_0$ have no common factors other than 1. If they had common factors other than one, then $\frac {m_0}  {n_0}$ would not be a irreducible fraction. I think that IT IS NOT THE CASE THAT $m_0$ and $n_0$ must have a common factor, $p > 1$. Let that fraction be $2/3$, $2/3$ is irreducible. 2 and 3 have no common factors other than $1$. I assume that if a fraction cannot be written in lowest terms, then the fraction is irreducible, i.e. something like one half.

That   proof assumed that for any positive integers $m$ and $n$, the fraction $\frac{m}{n}$   can be written in lowest terms, that is, in the form $\frac{m'}{n'}$ where $m'$   and $n'$ are positive integers with no common factors. How do we know   this is always possible? Suppose to the contrary that there were $m$, $n$ in $\mathbb{Z}^+$ such that the fraction $\frac{m}{n}$ cannot be written in lowest   terms. Now let $C$ be the set of positive integers that are numerators   of such fractions. Then $m$ in $C$, so $C$ is nonempty. Therefore, by Well   Ordering, there must be a smallest integer, $m_0$ in $C$. So by definition of   $C$, there is an integer $n_0 > 0$ such that the fraction $\frac{m_0}{n_0}$ cannot be   written in lowest terms. This means that $m_0$ and $n_0$ must have a common   factor, $p > 1$. But $(\frac{m_0}{p}) / (\frac{n_0}{p}) = \frac{m_0}{n_0}$ so any way of expressing the left hand fraction in lowest terms would   also work for $\frac{m_0}{n_0}$, which implies the fraction($\frac{m_0}{p}) / (\frac{n_0}{p})$ cannot be in written in lowest terms either. So by definition of $C$, the numerator, $\frac{m_0}{p}$, is in $C$. But $\frac{m_0}{p} < m_0$,   which contradicts the fact that $m_0$ is the smallest element of $C$. Since   the assumption that $C$ is nonempty leads to a contradiction, it follows   that $C$ must be empty. That is, that there are no numerators of   fractions that can’t be written in lowest terms, and hence there are   no such fractions at all. I don't really understand the part where, the author says: This means that $m_0$ and $n_0$ must have a common factor, $p > 1$ . BECAUSE $\frac {m_0}  {n_0}$ is a irreducible fraction, both $m_0$ and $n_0$ have no common factors other than 1. If they had common factors other than one, then $\frac {m_0}  {n_0}$ would not be a irreducible fraction. I think that IT IS NOT THE CASE THAT $m_0$ and $n_0$ must have a common factor, $p > 1$. Let that fraction be $2/3$, $2/3$ is irreducible. 2 and 3 have no common factors other than $1$. I assume that if a fraction cannot be written in lowest terms, then the fraction is irreducible, i.e. something like one half.
