I don't see where the cardinality of $[0,1]$ comes in. 13) a) Let $E$ be a $\tau$-bounded set in $C$.

If $g\in E$ then $d(g,0)<1$, because $|g(x)|<\infty$, from the above statement. Let $V_{\sigma} = \{g\in C : d(g,0) < 1\}$. Then, $tV_{\sigma} = \{f\in C : d(f,0)<t\}$.

14,Is the set of all invertible linear operators dense in the set of all linear operators?,Is the set of all invertible linear operators dense in the set of all linear operators?,,"Exercise 2 after $\S$ 91 from Paul R. Halmos's ""Finite-Dimensional Vector Spaces"" (second edition) invites to prove or disprove the following assertion. For every (bounded) linear transformation $A$ (on an inner product space) there exists a sequence $(A_n)$ of invertible linear transformations such that $A_n \rightarrow A$ . The inner product space, say $\mathcal V$ , of the assertion is not specified to be over the complex (or real) field, and is not said to be finite-dimensional or complete either. Also, for reference, $\S 91$ (from the book) identifies "" $A_n \rightarrow A$ "" in inner product spaces by $\Vert A_n - A \Vert \rightarrow 0$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$ . Further, $\S \ 87$ has the following definition for the norm $\Vert \cdot \Vert$ of a linear operator: $\Vert A \Vert = \inf \ \big\{K: \Vert Ax \Vert \leq K \Vert x \Vert \text{ for all vectors } x\big\}.$ I am able to see why the assertion holds if $\mathcal V$ is finite-dimensional; see my ""constructive"" proof below. I am unable to imagine what happens in the general case however, and would appreciate a proof or a counterexample in infinite dimensional spaces. Would also appreciate an advice if my proof is found to be inaccurate! Thanks. Proof (in finite dimensions): Let $\mathcal V$ be a $k$ -dimensional inner product space ( $0 \leq k < \infty$ ), and let $A$ be any linear operator on $\mathcal V$ . If $\mathcal N(A)$ is the null-space of $A$ , then $\mathcal N^\perp(A) \oplus \mathcal N(A) = \mathcal V$ . Also, if the rank of $A$ is $m \ (\leq k)$ , and if $\mathcal R(A)$ is the range of $A$ , then $m = $ dim $\mathcal R(A)=$ dim $\mathcal N^\perp(A) = k-$ dim $\mathcal N = k-$ dim $\mathcal R^\perp(A)$ . It is also true that $\mathcal R^\perp(A) \oplus \mathcal R(A) = \mathcal V$ . We now begin constructing a sequence $(A_n)$ of invertible linear operators such that $A_n \rightarrow A$ . Let $B$ be the restriction of $A$ to the $m$ -dimensional $\mathcal N^\perp(A)$ . It is clear that $B$ maps $m$ -dimensional $\mathcal N^\perp(A)$ onto $m$ -dimensional $\mathcal R(A)$ , and is invertible. Next, write $C_n x_i = \frac{1}{n}y_i$ for $n = 1, 2, \cdots$ and for $i = 1, \cdots, k-m$ , where $\{x_1, \cdots, x_{k-m}\}$ and $\{y_1, \cdots, y_{k-m}\}$ are any bases in the $(k-m)$ -dimensional subspaces $\mathcal N(A)$ and $\mathcal R^\perp (A)$ respectively. (It is clear that $C_n$ is a linear map with rank $k-m$ , and is invertible.) Next, if, for every $z = (z_1+z_2)$ in $\mathcal V$ , we write $A_n z = B z_1 + C_n z_2$ for $n = 1, 2, \cdots$ , whenever $z_1$ and $z_2$ are in $\mathcal N^\perp(A)$ and $\mathcal N(A)$ respectively, then we find that $A_n$ is a linear mapping of $\mathcal V$ onto $\mathcal V$ , and is invertible.

I have already shown it is a linear isometry. Can I use the Hahn-Banach theorem to find $y'\in (\ell^\infty)'$ such that there is no $y\in\ell^1$ with $\Phi  y=y'$ . I have written my own answer the following way (corollary 4.14 is a corollary in my lecture notes stating that $X$ is seperable if $X'$ is. I have proven earlier that $\ell^\infty$ is inseperable) Proposition 2: The map $$\Phi_\infty:\ell^1\to(\ell^\infty)',\qquad(\Phi_\infty y)(x)=\sum_{i\in\mathbb{N}}x^iy^i$$ is not surjective. The proof is based on the following lemma, which consists of two parts. Lemma 1. Let $X$ and $Y$ be normed spaces. Then the following claims are true: If $f:X\to Y$ is a surjective linear isometry, then $f$ is a homeomorphism. Let $f: X\to Y$ be a homeomorphism. If $X$ is a seperable space, then $Y$ is a seperable space. Proof of 1: We remark that every isometry is automatically injective. Since $f$ is also surjective, $f$ is a bijection. Now, we calculate $|f|_{op}=\sup\{||f(x)||_Y\,\big|\,||x||_X\leq 1\}=\sup\{||x||_X\,\big|\,||x||_X\leq 1 \}=1<\infty$ , hence $f$ is bounded. Since $f$ is linear, $f$ is continuous. We will now show that $f^{-1}$ is continuous. We remark that $f^{-1}$ is linear. We also remark that for all $y\in Y$ , $||y||_Y=||f(f^{-1}(y))||_Y=||f^{-1}(y)||_X$ , hence $f^{-1}$ is an isometry, too. Then, $|f^{-1}|_{op}=\sup\{||f^{-1}(y)||_X\,\big|\,||y||_Y\leq 1\}=\sup\{||y||_Y\,\big|\,||y||_Y\leq 1\}=1<\infty$ , hence $f^{-1}$ is bounded. It follows that $f^{-1}$ is continuous, hence $f$ is a homeomorphism. \ \ Proof of 2: Let $X$ be a seperable normed space and let $f:X\to Y$ be a homeomorphism. Since $X$ is seperable, there exists a countable dense subset $A\subseteq X$ . Then, $f(A)$ is a countable subset of $Y$ . We will show that $f(A)$ is dense in $Y$ . \ \ Let $V$ be an open set in $Y$ . By continuity of $f$ , $f^{-1}(V)$ is open in $X$ , so $A\cap f^{-1}(V)\neq\emptyset$ . By bijectivity, we see that $\emptyset\neq f(A\cap f^{-1}(V))=f(A)\cap f(f^{-1}(V))=f(A)\cap V$ . This holds for all open sets in $Y$ , hence $f(A)$ is dense in $Y$ . It follows that $Y$ is seperable. We can now prove proposition 2. By theorem 4.6, $\Phi_\infty$ is a well-defined linear isometry. We remark that $\ell^1$ is seperable. It follows by corollary 4.14 that $(\ell^\infty)'$ is inseperable since $\ell^\infty$ is inseperable.\ \ We will give a proof by contradiction. Suppose that $\Phi_\infty$ is surjective. Then, $\Phi_\infty$ is a surjective linear isometry and by lemma 1 part \textit{i}, a homeomorphism. Since $\ell^{1}$ is seperable, it follows by lemma 1 part \textit{ii} that $\Phi_\infty(\ell^{1})=(\ell^\infty)'$ is seperable, but this is a contradiction since we know by corollary 4.14 that $(\ell^\infty)'$ is inseperable.
