0,Simplifying $\int\cos^2(x)\sin(2x)dx$ via the optimal substitution,Simplifying  via the optimal substitution,\int\cos^2(x)\sin(2x)dx,"I was just tutoring and a student's question was: Make a trig substitution to make evaluating $\int \cos^2(x)\sin(2x)dx$ simpler. So yeah, the question is only asking for what trigonometric substitution do we use to simplify the integral, it's not asking to evaluate the integral. FIRST ATTEMPT: Using $\sin(2x)=2\cos(x)\sin(x)$ the integral becomes $$\begin{aligned}&\int\cos^2(x)\sin(2x)dx\\&=\int\cos^2(x)2\cos(x)\sin(x)dx\\&=2\int\cos^3(x)\sin(x)\end{aligned}$$ I thought this was a good answer because if we set $u =\cos^2(x)$ , then by the chain rule we get $$du = -2\cos(x)\sin(x)dx$$ and thus $$\frac{du}{-2\cos(x)\sin(x)}=dx$$ And so $$\begin{aligned}&\int\cos^2(x)2\cos(x)\sin(x)dx\\&=2\int\cos^3(x)\sin(x)dx\\&=\int\cos^2(x)(2\cos(x)\sin(x))dx\\&=\int\cos^2(x)(2\cos(x)\sin(x))\left(\frac{du}{-2\cos(x)\sin(x)}\right)\\&=\int\cos^2(x)\\&=\int udu\end{aligned}$$ And is thus quite solvable. However, the computer said that this substitution was not correct. SECOND ATTEMPT: I used $\cos^2(x) = \frac{1+\cos(2x)}{2}$ to get: $$\begin{aligned}\int\cos^2(x)\sin(2x)dx\\&=\int \left(\frac{1+\cos(2x)}2\right)\sin(2x)dx\\&=\int \left(\frac{\sin(2x)+\sin(2x)\cos(2x)}2\right)dx\\&=\int\left(\frac{sin(2x)}2+\frac{\sin(2x)\cos(2x)}2\right)dx\end{aligned}$$ which is quite a simplification, and we can even take this one further with realizing that since $\sin(2x)=2\sin(x)\cos(x)$ we have that $\sin(4x)=2\sin(2x)\cos(2x)$ . Thus our integral becomes: $$=\int\left(\frac{\sin(2x)}2+\frac{\sin(4x)}2\right)dx$$ which I think is quite simple. However, the homework program did not accept this substitution as the correct substitution to make either. Does anyone have any ideas?","I was just tutoring and a student's question was: Make a trig substitution to make evaluating simpler.

Is there a way to prove that the projected solid's volume is one third that of the triangular prism of same height and base values for any value of N? Both intuitive and purely mathematical proofs are acceptable.","Is there any way to prove that for any isosceles triangle, the volume of a solid created when that triangle is projected to a point determining the height above the angle opposite the hypotenuse is one third of the volume of a triangular prism of the same height and base shape? Here's a sketch. The projected solid can be thought of as one quarter of a square pyramid when N is 90 degrees.
