In case context helps, the question came up while studying the setup for Young's double slit experiment: It seems standard in textbooks to assert, as above, that the angles of two rays (one from each slit) that meet some distance away can be considered equal, in order to arrive at a simple equation for the difference in length between the two rays. But I was curious what the exact formula was. So I sketched it out and found the length of the two rays depend not only on the distance between the slits $d$ but the distance between the slits and the screen, $L$ : $$ L_1,L_2=\sqrt{\left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2+\left(\frac{L}{\cos{\theta}}\right)^2\mp dL\tan{\theta}} $$ I don't imagine this can be simplified any further, so next I wanted to verify that the difference between the two lengths approximately equals $d\sin\theta$ , but I'm not sure how to go about doing that. Ignore unless needed In case I made a mistake, here's the sketch I used. I'm saying ignore this unless necessary because I used different variables, which unfortunately confuses things. The $a$ in the sketch is really $d$ above, and the $d$ in the sketch is what I've called $L$ above.

In case context helps, the question came up while studying the setup for Young's double slit experiment: It seems standard in textbooks to assert, as above, that the angles of two rays (one from each slit) that meet some distance away can be considered equal, in order to arrive at a simple equation for the difference in length between the two rays. But I was curious what the exact formula was. So I sketched it out and found the length of the two rays depend not only on the distance between the slits but the distance between the slits and the screen, : I don't imagine this can be simplified any further, so next I wanted to verify that the difference between the two lengths approximately equals , but I'm not sure how to go about doing that.

Therefore, using spherical parameterization, $ (x, y, z) = 6 ( \sin \theta \cos \phi, \sin \theta \sin \phi, \cos \theta ) $ Hence our function becomes a function of $\theta$ and $\phi$ $f(\theta, \phi) = 36 ( \sin^2 \theta \cos \phi \sin \phi + 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta \sin \phi ) $ Using $\sin^2 \theta = \dfrac{1}{2} (1 - \cos(2 \theta) ) $ and $ 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta = \sin(2 \theta) $ The function now becomes, $ f(\theta, \phi) = 9 \bigg( (1 - \cos(2 \theta)) \sin(2 \phi) + 4 \sin(2 \theta ) \sin \phi \bigg) $ Maximizing over $\theta$ first $ f_1(\phi) = 9 \sqrt{ (1 - \cos(2 \phi))^2 + 16 \sin^2(\phi) } $ Using the identities mentioned above this simplifies to $ f_1(\phi) = 9 \sqrt{ (1 - \cos(2 \phi) )^2 + 8 (1 - \cos(2 \phi) ) } $ Let $u = \cos(2 \phi) $ , then basically we want to maximize $ g(u) = u^2 - 10 u + 9 $ over $[-1, 1]$ .  It is easy to find that the maximum of $g$ is at $u = -1$ and the maximum is $g_{Max} = 20 $ Thus the maximum of our function is $ f_{Max} = 9  \sqrt{ 20 } = 18 \sqrt{5} \approx 40.25 $ Another method is one that requires finding the eigenvalues of the matrix $ Q = \begin{bmatrix} 0 && \dfrac{1}{2} && 0 \\ \dfrac{1}{2} && 0 && 1 \\ 0 && 1 && 0 \end{bmatrix} $ The characteristic polynomial is $ \lambda ( \lambda^2 - \dfrac{5}{4} ) = 0 $ Thus $\lambda_{Max} = \sqrt{\dfrac{5}{4}} = \dfrac{1}{2} \sqrt{5} $ Multiplying this by $36$ gives the answer as $ 18 \sqrt{5} $ .

Next, I seek to find the phase-shift difference between my $\sqrt{5}\cos{x}$ and $\cos{x} + 2\sin{x}$ , so, I take two reference points at their relative roots, i.e. $\cos{x} + 2\sin{x} = 0 \iff x = -\arctan{\frac{1}{2}} + n\pi, n \in \mathbb{Z}$ , and respectively, $\sqrt{5}\cos{x} = 0 \iff x = \frac{\pi}{2} + n\pi, n \in \mathbb{Z}$ . So I figure that if I take the x's matching with the roots of the functions in the same period, then I should have the phase-shift and my function mutation should be done. I take $n = 1$ for both functions, so I have $x_{\sqrt{5}\cos{x}} = \pi + \frac{\pi}{2}$ and $x_{\cos{x} + 2\sin{x}} = \pi - \arctan{\frac{1}{2}}$ .

Essentially we must show that if $$r_1\sin(x)+r_2\sin(2x)=0,$$ then the only solution is $r_1=r_2 = 0$, where $r_1,r_2\in\mathbb{R}$. This should hold for all $x$. Can I get an answer that doesn't deal with integrating and such? If we consider $x=0$, then the value of $r_1,r_2$ do not matter, as the equation still evaluates to $0$, but in this case $r_i\neq 0$, so does this mean its not linearly independent?","Prove the set $\{\sin(x),\sin(2x)\}$ in $F(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R})$ is linearly independent I know this has been asked before, but I'm looking for a solution without integration that makes sense.

99,Is there a solution for $\sum_{k=1}^{n}\cos(kx) = a$?,Is there a solution for ?,\sum_{k=1}^{n}\cos(kx) = a,"I am trying to predict the phase error in a chip based on its DFT components. Therefore it would be amazing if there is a specific solution of x for the following equation: $$ \sum_{k=1}^{n}\cos(kx) = a $$ For the domain of x such that there is a unique mapping from the LHS to the RHS. In the general case this condition is for sure satisfied in the domain of $x = [0, \frac{\pi}{n}]$. However this domain could be larger. For example in the case of n = 3, WolframAlpha told me that there is a unique mapping between LHS and RHS for the domain of $x = [0, \sim 0.4\pi]$. The values of $a$ are only valid in the range $a = [n, ?)$, but I don't think it is of that much importance to know the exact lower bound of $a$ at this time. I tried to solve this equation by looking at a specific case of this general equation, which can be found in this question on StackExchange . The given solution is valid since the identity $\cos(a)\sin(b)=\frac{1}{2}(\sin(a+b)−\sin(a−b))$, which results in a factor of $a$ (namely $\frac{1}{2}$) on the LHS such that the $a\sin{\frac{x}{2}}$ on both sides of the equal sign cancel. In the general case, this is of course not the case since $|a|$ is not by definition equal to $\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore: Does anyone know if this equation could have a specific solution (and why or why no)? If the answer to 1. is Yes: What will be the solution to this equation? Also the solution to a more specific case, like n = 3 or 4 (or preferable 8, because I perform an 8 sample DFT) would we very welcome.
