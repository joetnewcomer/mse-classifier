6,"The ""depth"" of a set","The ""depth"" of a set",,"I came to think about a subject which I'm almost sure has already be studied, but I would not know how to search for it. What I mean is the ""depth"" of a set. For finite depths (what that means will be clear in a moment), it is easy to define: The empty set has depth zero. A non-empty set has a depth of one more than the largest depth of its member sets. So for example, the set $\{\emptyset\}$ has depth $1$, the sets $\{\emptyset,\{\emptyset\}\}$ and $\{\{\emptyset\}\}$ have both depth $2$, and $\{\{\{\emptyset\}\},\{\emptyset\}\}$ has depth 3. Now it is obvious that this concept extends to infinite depths. For example, $\omega$ has infinite depth because it contains sets of any finite depth. Now it seems obvious that $\{\omega\}$ should have a larger depth because its element already has an infinite depth. So it may make sense that the possible depths are given by ordinal numbers (a nice side effect would be that each ordinal number would be its own depth). On the other hand, maybe it doesn't really make sense to make that distinction (just like $\omega$ and $\omega+1$ have the same cardinality). So maybe the depth should be measured by cardinal numbers instead. Or maybe the depths form their own class of numbers, distinct both from the class of cardinals and the class of ordinals? Clearly to make this decision, there needs to be a formal way to decide whether two sets have the same depth. I have no idea how to define it (except for finite depth by the explicit recursion), or if there can be a meaningful definition at all (besides the obvious choice to give all sets of infinite depth the same depth $\infty$). However if the depth can have a meaningful definition for infinite-depth sets, I'm sure this has already be done by someone (although quite possibly under another name; a web search for ""depth of sets"" didn't seem to find anything relevant). (PS: I have no idea which of the two ""set-theory"" tags is appropriate; I just assumed that if I can discover the concept without ever having had a course in set theory, it's probably elementary and thus chose that tag)","I came to think about a subject which I'm almost sure has already be studied, but I would not know how to search for it.

Because such a well-defined and existent set such as $\wp(A)$ should not contain nonexistent elements, to prove the existence of its elements is important. It seems that two alternatives arise: Being a member of $\wp(A)$ automatically makes this thing to exist; or There should be an alternative to prove the existence of all subsets of $A$ without the axiom of power set.",,[]

The 2nd and 3rd paragraphs are not very clear to me. Here is the text: Zorn's lemma. If $X$ is a partially ordered set such that every chain in $X$ has an upper bound, then $X$ contains a maximal element. Proof. The first step is to replace the abstract partial ordering in $X$ by the    inclusion order in a suitable collection of sets. More precisely, we consider,    for each element $x \in X$, the weak initial segment $\bar{s}(x)$ consisting of $x$ and    all its predecessors. The range $\mathscr{S}$ of the function $\bar{s}$ (from $X$ to$\wp(X)$) is a certain collection of subsets of $X$, which we may, of course, regard as  (partially) ordered by inclusion. The function $\bar{s}$ is one-to-one, and a necessary    and sufficient condition that $\bar{s}(x)\subseteq \bar{s}(y)$ is that $x\leq y$. In view of this, the task of finding a maximal element in $X$ is the same as the task of finding a maximal set in $\mathscr{S}$. The hypothesis about chains in $X$ implies (and is,    in fact, equivalent to) the corresponding statement about chains in $\mathscr{S}$. Let $\mathscr{X}$ be the set of all chains in $X$; every member of $\mathscr{X}$ is included in $\bar{s}(x)$ for some $x \in X$. The collection $\mathscr{X}$ is a non-empty collection of sets,    partially ordered by inclusion, and such that if $\mathscr{C}$ is a chain in $\mathscr{X}$, then the    union of the sets in $\mathscr{C}$ (i.e., $\bigcup_{A \in \mathscr{C}}A$) belongs to $\mathscr{X}$. Since each set in $\mathscr{X}$ is    dominated by some set in $\mathscr{S}$, the passage from $\mathscr{S}$ to $\mathscr{X}$ cannot introduce any    new maximal elements. One advantage of the collection $\mathscr{X}$ is the slightly    more specific form that the chain hypothesis assumes; instead of saying    that each chain $\mathscr{C}$ has some upper bound in $\mathscr{S}$, we can say explicitly that the union of the sets of $\mathscr{C}$, which is clearly an upper bound of $\mathscr{C}$, is an element of the collection $\mathscr{X}$. Another technical advantage of $\mathscr{X}$ is that it contains all the subsets of each of its sets; this makes it possible to enlarge    non-maximal sets in $\mathscr{X}$ slowly, one element at a time. Now we can forget about the given partial order in $X$. In what follows    we consider a non-empty collection $\mathscr{X}$ of subsets of a non-empty set $X$, subject to two conditions: every subset of each set in $\mathscr{X}$ is in $\mathscr{X}$, and the    union of each chain of sets in $\mathscr{X}$ is in $\mathscr{X}$.

56,Why is it not important what mathematical objects are?,Why is it not important what mathematical objects are?,,"In axiomatic set theory the term ""set"" and the relation "" $\in$ "" are primitive notions. Thus, it is not defined what sets are nor what the relation is. Axiomatic set theory is supposed to formalize how sets ""behave"", meaning what is true about them. One of the axioms is the axiom of infinity, which ensures that one can encode the natural numbers as sets, thus proving their existence from ZFC. This is one common procedure that is done in mathematics: we have an intuitive notion, namely the natural numbers "" $\{1,2,3,4,...\}$ "" that we used for a long time and want to make this precise mathematically. Thus, when ZFC is used as the chosen foundation, one tries to encode this intuitive object using sets. Another example where this is done is the notion of a function. Intuitively a function is an object/concept of mapping an object of one collection to exactly one object of another collection. This can again be defined in set theory: Suppose that $X$ and $Y$ are sets, then a function $f$ is defined to be a subset $f \subseteq X \times Y$ that satisfies the following condition. For every $x \in X$ there exists exactly one $y \in Y$ such that $(x,y) \in f$ . Thus we have proven that there exist objects that we call ""functions"" that have the property we intuitively expect functions to have, or more precisely that we expect the intuitive notion of function to satisfy. These are of course only two examples of many, where some intuitive concepts are encoded as sets. In my understanding, we have built ""models"" (I know this term is used with a meaning in logic, however I don't know if this is the same way its being used there; I am using it with the usual meaning of being a model for somethign) for intuitive concepts. It might be however, that, assuming the existence of mathematical objects, the actual objects are not encoded as sets, or that you are using a different definition for the same concept. In this sense, these might be the ""wrong"" definitions, without us knowing whether they are or not. My question is , why is this not problematic? Why do we not care what mathematical objects are but only what we can do with them/what is true about them? An attempt of answering this myself : I suspect that this is because the models we built above satisfy the essential properties we expect the intuitive notions to have. That is, if these intutive notions actually exist, they would have to have these properties. Thus when we prove anything for our models only using these properties, they necessarily would also have to be true for the actual objects. The same goes for different definitions/models of the intended intuitive notion. They would have the same essential properties. Thus, it doesnt matter what the mathematical objects are, since our model serves to prove the properties about them, no matter what they are. If I understand correctly, a similar view can be found in these notes that I randomly found some time ago. On page 25 of the document it says: ""The theorems that we proved for a Peano system also turn out to be true when they are interpreted as being statements about whole numbers. This is just what one would expect: if the axioms of $\mathcal{P}$ are true when interpreted as statements about whole numbers, then all the logical consequences of those axioms (theorems) will also be true about whole numbers."" Another related question: When axiomatic set theory doesn't say what sets are, then could they be anything that satisfies the axioms? One intuitively has collections in mind when thinking about sets, which should be fine, as long as one uses the axioms to construct new collections. However, axiomatic set theory doesn't tell us that sets are collections. They could thus be anyhting. If this were correct, I guess one could use the same approach as above and view sets as a model for collections, meaning that the intuitive notion of a collection obeys these axioms, which means that anything we prove about sets is also true for the intuitive notion of a collection. So are sets necessarily collections? All of this would also make it a bit more intuitive why abstract concepts such as numbers of pure math actually work when talking counting real world things, or applying these concepts in general to the real world.","In axiomatic set theory the term ""set"" and the relation "" "" are primitive notions.

Proof: Without loss of generality, we can safely assume that $A \cap B=\varnothing$ . For any $x \in A \cup B$ , we can form a unique sequence by repeatedly applying $f$ and $g$ to go right, and $g^{-1}$ and $f^{-1}$ to go left whenever $g^{-1}(x)$ and $f^{-1}(x)$ are defined. Such sequence looks like: $$\cdots \rightarrow f^{-1}(g^{-1}(x)) \rightarrow g^{-1}(x) \rightarrow x \rightarrow f(x) \rightarrow g(f(x)) \rightarrow \cdots$$ For any particular $x$ , the sequence may terminate to the left or not, at a point when $f^{-1}$ or $g^{-1}$ is not defined. Since $f$ and $g$ are injective, each $x$ is in exactly one such sequence to within identity (if an element occurs in two sequences, all elements to the left and to the right must be the same in both. So these two sequences are identical). Therefore, the sequences form a partition of $A \cup B$ . Call a sequence an A-stopper if it stops at an element of $A$ , or a B-stopper if it stops at an element of $B$ . Otherwise, call it doubly infinite . It suffices to generate bijection for each sequence as follows. A-stopper Let $A_1$ be the set of its elements in $A$ , $B_1$ be the set of its elements in $B$ . Let $h:A_1 \to B_1$ such that $h(a)=f(a)$ for all $a \in A_1$ . $h(a_1)=h(a_2) \implies f(a_1)=f(a_2) \implies a_1=a_2$ [Since $f$ is injective] $\implies h$ is injective. For $b \in B_1$ , there exists $x=f^{-1}(b) \in A_1$ [If not, this sequence will stop at $b \in B$ , which contradicts to the fact that it is A-stopper ). $h(x)=f(f^{-1}(b)=b \implies h$ is surjective. Thus $h:A_1 \to B_1$ is bijective. B-stopper Let $A_2$ be the set of its elements in $A$ , $B_2$ be the set of its elements in $B$ . Let $k:B_2 \to A_2$ such that $k(b)=g(b)$ for all $b \in B_2$ . $k(b_1)=k(b_2) \implies g(b_1)=g(b_2) \implies b_1=b_2$ [Since $g$ is injective] $\implies k$ is injective. For $a \in A_2$ , there exists $y=g^{-1}(a) \in B_2$ [If not, this sequence will stop at $a \in A$ , which contradicts to the fact that it is B-stopper ). $k(y)=g(g^{-1}(a)=a \implies k$ is surjective.

Now, for the last one, he drew a big line through it, claiming that it introduced issues. It would seem to me that the two before also introduce fairly massive issues, but when I asked a friendly academic, he brushed me off without any real explanation, saying there would be no such issues.

Ok, so it would seem to me that for the set of all true statements of first order logic to be useful to us, it would first be necessary for us to be able to check whether a statement is in the set, and also that it's complement is the set of all false statements of first order logic. Now, by Gödel any formal logical system that can reason about arithmetic must be incomplete (there are true statements of arithmetic that cannot be proved to be true or false in the logical system) or inconsistent (there are statements that can be proved to be both true and false). So, a simple way of proving whether a statement is in the set is to define a proof program. We have our simple laws of inference ($\vee$-introduction, elimination etc), so it's fairly easy to, looking at a proof in FOL see whether the prover's done something not allowed. So, we go through every string of length 1, then every string of length 2, etc until we find a valid proof of the statement; if the program terminates and there are no syntax errors, it is known that the statement is true. To avoid going on forever with statements which are not in the set, we also check to see whether the negation of the formula is true, since by the law of excluded middle, if something's not true it's false. Now, by Gödel, the program must a) go on forever for some statements, since if FOL is incomplete, there will be no proof in the system that certain statements are in the set (even though they are true). or b) there will be certain statements for which testing both the statement and its negation will result in an affirmative answer (i.e. FOL is inconsistent).
