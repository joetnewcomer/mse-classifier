I am not looking for a solution using double integrals. I tried to turn this into a Riemann sum, but I couldn't make any progress. I thought about using the squeeze theorem, but I can't find any useful inequalities, I just tried to use AM-GM on the denominator, but it didn't help.

16,Quick way of solving the contour integral $\oint \frac{1}{1+z^5} dz$,Quick way of solving the contour integral,\oint \frac{1}{1+z^5} dz,"Consider the contour integral in the complex plane: $$\oint \frac{1}{1+z^5} dz$$ Here the contour is a circle with radius $3$ with centre in the origin. If we look at the poles, they need to satisfy $z^5 = -1$ . So the solutions of the poles are given by: \begin{align*} z_0 &= \cos(\frac{\pi}{5}) + i \sin(\frac{\pi}{5})\\ z_1 &= \cos(\frac{3\pi}{5}) + i \sin(\frac{3\pi}{5})\\ z_2 &= \cos(\pi) + i \sin(\pi) = -1\\ z_3 &= \cos(\frac{7\pi}{5}) + i \sin(\frac{7\pi}{5})\\ z_4 &= \cos(\frac{9\pi}{5}) + i \sin(\frac{9\pi}{5}) \end{align*} So one can use Cauchy's formula or the residue theorem to calculate for every solution the integral and then adding them up to get the full integral. But I have the feeling that there needs to be a more simple way of calculating the full contour integral. Can one just calculate the integral for one solution $z_i$ (like the simple solution $-1$ ) and then multiply by it $5$ , suggesting that the others have the same value. This would make the calculation much efficienter. EDIT: I now see that $4$ solutions are symmetric (the solutions except $z=-1$ ) in the complex plane. If one approximates the solutions of the poles in decimals, one finds: \begin{align*} z_0 &= 0.81 + 0.58i\\ z_1 &= -0.31 + 0.95i\\ z_2 &= -1\\ z_3 &= -0.31 -0.95i\\ z_4 &= 0.81 -0.58i \end{align*} So there are four symmetric solutions.
