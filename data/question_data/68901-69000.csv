I completed this proof for a problem in Rudin, but wanted some verification. Does this look correct? Proof that every compact metric space $K$ has a countable base and is therefore separable: Consider $p \in K$ with an arbitrary $\epsilon > 0.$ By the Archemedian Principle, there exists a natural number $n$ such that $\frac{1}{n} < \epsilon.$ Consider the open cover $$K \subset \bigcup_{i \in K} N_{\frac{1}{n}}(i).$$ Since $K$ is compact, there exists a finite subcover $$K \subset \bigcup_{i \in X_n} N_{\frac{1}{n}}(i),$$ where $X_n = \{x_{1_n}, x_{2_n}, x_{3_n}, ... x_{j_n}\} \subset K$ for some $j_n \in \mathbf{N}.$ Since $p \in K$, $p \in N_{\frac{1}{n}}(x_{i_n})$ for some $x_{i_n} \in X_n$. This means that $d(p, x_{i_n}) \leq \frac{1}{n}$, which also implies that $x_{i_n} \in N_\frac{1}{n}(p) \subset N_{\epsilon}(p),$ so $x_{i_n} \in N_{\epsilon}(p).$ Since $x_{i_n}$ is a member of $X_n$, $N_{\epsilon}(p)$ thus intersects the finite subset $X_n$. As the choices for $p \in K$ and $\epsilon$ were arbitrary, any neighborhood around every point in $K$ must intersect a countable subset $X$. By definition of closure of a set, $K \subset$ cl$(X)$.  This means that $X$ is dense in $K$ and thus forms a countable base. Therefore $K$ is separable.","I'm in high school and self-studying analysis.

23,To what extent are homeomorphisms just deformations?,To what extent are homeomorphisms just deformations?,,"Background. It is often said that two spaces are homeomorphic if, roughly speaking, one space can be continuously deformed into the other without any tearing and gluing. It is then emphasized that this is more of a guiding principle than a solid fact. Indeed, a well-known 'counterexample' to this heuristic would be double-twisted Möbius strip $M$ , which is homeomorphic to the cylinder $C$ , but when we visualize the two spaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$ , we find that we cannot deform into each other without tearing. Why does this happen? In a sense this is because $\mathbb{R}^3$ does not have enough room for the desired deformation; there simply aren't enough dimensions to 'untwist' the double twist without tearing things up. This leads us to the following: Preliminary question. Suppose I were to embed $M$ and $C$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for some large $n$ . Can I now deform one into the other without tearing or gluing? The answer turns out to be yes, and in fact I believe $n = 4$ already suffices. If you care for the informal proof, read on; if not, scroll down to the main part. Let us start with a suitable embedding of a double twist. This picture visualizes an embedding of the double twist within $\mathbb{R}^4$ , where the first three dimensions are spatial, and the fourth dimension is represented by different colours. (The choice of colours may be unfortunate, but I did not have any other pens.) Now imagine moving the 'left strip' and the 'right strip' closer together, like so. Notice that the 'double twist' starts to resemble a loop. Now, if we move the strips yet closer, they will start to overlap spatially. But notice that the colours will remain different on the overlap so that no actual tearing or gluing occurs. Now keep going until the two strips fully overlap each other. At this point the colors have aligned, so that the twist has turned into a 'loop'. This loop is undesirable, but the solution to that issue is simple. During the proces in which we let the strips overlap, we simply let the size of the loop go to zero. At the very moment that the overlap is complete (and the colors have aligned), the size of the loop reaches, and as such the loop will vanish altogether. 'QED'. To our main question. We see that our counterexample is no longer a counterexample. We might therefore wonder if this is part of a general phenomenon. Let us make this more precise. Let $X$ be a topological space, and let $f : X\to \mathbb{R}^n$ and $g : X \to \mathbb{R}^n$ be two embeddings. Denote by $\varepsilon_{n,m} : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^{n+m}$ the embedding which sends a point $x$ to $(x,0)$ . Let's say $f$ can be deformed by embeddings into $g$ if there exists an $m$ and a homotopy from $H : X \times I \to \mathbb{R}^{n+m}$ from $\varepsilon_{n,m} \circ f$ to $\varepsilon_{n,m} \circ g$ such that for all $t\in [0,1]$ , the map $H_t : X \to \mathbb{R}^{n+m}$ is a continuous embedding. Question. Suppose $X$ is a reasonable space (say, a compact manifold with boundary). Let $f$ and $g$ be two embeddings of $X$ into some $\mathbb{R}^n$ . Can $f$ always be deformed by embeddings into $g$ ? This question can be generalized and specialized in many ways, so feel free to change some of its details.","Background.

Basically discrete topologies gains us no new insights compared to elementary set theory. Moreover, points not having unique neighborhood systems lead to all sorts of pathologies (for example here: Non-T1 Space: Is the set of limit points closed? ), and even the Zariski topology, which is the most pathological commonly used topology of which I am aware, is still in general $T0$. Finally, any non-$T0$ space should be homeomorphic (I think) to the quotient of the space under the equivalence relation "" $x \sim y$ if and only if $x$ and $y$ are topologically indistinguishable"".

In his theory Riesz succeeded in deriving the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem and the Heine-Borel Theorem. We will not discuss this paper. We will restrict ourselves to a shorter paper that was presented by Riesz in 1908 at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Rome. In that paper, «Stetigkeit und Abstract Mengenlehre» (Riesz [148]), concentrates on the characterization of mathematical continua. We will briefly describe some of the ideas the Riesz describes in the paper. As we said, Riesz’s basic notion is the notion of a limit point (Verdichtungsstelle). I'm not asking anyone to agree with Riesz's basic goal (to get a rigorous distinction between ""continuous"" and ""discrete"" spaces or time). To those who might object that the standard three axioms are all that are necessary to define the notions of connectedness and compactness, I have several responses: Connectedness actually isn't that nice of a property. We could look at the topologist's sine curve or the infinite broom for examples, but for me the fact that there exists a countable, Hausdorff, and connected set implies that topological connectedness is not quite the intuitive connectedness from Euclidean spaces which we want to generalize for an arbitrary ""continuous space"". In my mind, path connectedness better satisfies this criterion, since every non-trivial T1 path-connected space is uncountable . Path connectedness does provide reasonable properties, although one can object that the definition is somewhat of a tautology (""a space behaves like the real line if it behaves like the real line"") and requires the prior construction of the real line in order to define, rather than being constructible from first principles. Compactness also isn't very nice unless we are in a Hausdorff space, since otherwise compact sets aren't even closed. Sure $T0$ isn't Hausdorff, but it's certainly a step in the right direction. (Hence why the distinction between ""compactness"" and ""quasicompactness"" is so prevalent in algebraic geometry where the non-Hausdorff Zariski topology so frequently comes into play). For non-$T0$ spaces, the set of limit points isn't even closed, limits aren't unique or well-defined... the notion of limit so intrinsic to the idea of a ""continuous space"" clearly requires at least $T0$, if not even $T1$ or $T2$, to function even remotely similarly to intuition.

60,Why the axioms for a topological space are those axioms?,Why the axioms for a topological space are those axioms?,,"This question might have even been asked here before, I don't really know, so sorry if it's duplicate. I've started to study topological spaces and I've found the axioms for such spaces kind of hard to motivate. Well, the ideia of a metric space is much easier to motivate: ""the concept of distance is context dependent, so we want a general idea of what distance is and a general idea of a set on which we can measure distances"". The axioms then for a metric are very intuitive, easy to motivate and everything else. Then we start studying properties of subsets of metric spaces. We define open balls as a way to make precise the notion of ""the set of all points that are sufficiently close to a central point"" and we define open sets to make precise  ""sets such that for every point, other points sufficiently close are also in the set"", which can also be thought as sets such that each point can be oscilated a little bit from it's position and the point will stay on the set. After that we can define lots of things: limit points, closed sets, dense sets, perfect sets, compactness and so on. We also see that all of those notions can be made precise mentioning the open sets alone: the metric is not really necessary to talk about those things, as soon as we can define what open sets are. So this is enough motivation to define a structure on which we have open sets. The answer to this problem is to define a topology on a set $X$ as a set $\mathcal{T} \subset \mathcal{P}(X)$ such that $\mathcal{T}$ is closed under arbitrary unions, finite intersections and such that $X,\emptyset \in \mathcal{T}$. If, $X$ is a metric space, and we let $\mathcal{T}$ be the set of open sets as they are defined using balls, then the three properties are satisfied.

My question is whethere the ""topologist's sine curve"" defined as $S = \{(0, y) : y \in (-1,1)\} \cup \{(x, \sin (1/x)) : x \in (0, 2/\pi)\}$ can be a manifold. I tried to find some explnations in books and web. However, what I found are all about (path/local) connectedness. I'm not familiar with topology and not want to study it extensively. So I tried to understand the question with very minimal knowledge. As far as I understand, to say that a set is a manifold, I need to set a topology (open subsets) on the set. As a subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$, every open set in $S$ should have a form $S \cap A$ for an open set $A \in \mathbb{R}^2$. Any interval in the vertical axis part of $S$, e.g. $I = \{(0, y) : 0 < y < 1/2\}$, cannot be an open set in $S$. It is because every open set in $\mathbb{R}^2$ containing $I$ also contains some other part of $S$ : there is no way to express $I$ in the form of $S \cap A$ where $A$ is open in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Then there is no homeomorphism from an open subset of $S$ containing $I$ to an open set in $\mathbb{R}$. It is because, if there is one, the preimage of an open interval in $\mathbb{R}$, to which $I$ is mapped, must be open but $I$ is not open. So there cannot be a coordinate chart for $I$ and $S$ is not a manifold. This is what I understand. My first question is whether or not this understanding is correct. The second question is whether $S$ can be a manifold if I give a different topology. I cannot express precisly how to define the topology but intuitively the sine function part is homeomorphic to an open interval in the real line and the vertical part is also homeomorphic to an open interval in the real line, if I consider $S$ as a space of its own, not a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^2$. Is this true? If true, how can I express the topology precisley? This question is not a duplicate of Topologist's Sine Curve not a regular submanifold of $\mathbb{R^2}$? . I read it. However, the concept of connectedness confuses me.

Then there is no homeomorphism from an open subset of $S$ containing $I$ to an open set in $\mathbb{R}$. It is because, if there is one, the preimage of an open interval in $\mathbb{R}$, to which $I$ is mapped, must be open but $I$ is not open. So there cannot be a coordinate chart for $I$ and $S$ is not a manifold. This is what I understand. My first question is whether or not this understanding is correct. The second question is whether $S$ can be a manifold if I give a different topology. I cannot express precisly how to define the topology but intuitively the sine function part is homeomorphic to an open interval in the real line and the vertical part is also homeomorphic to an open interval in the real line, if I consider $S$ as a space of its own, not a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^2$. Is this true? If true, how can I express the topology precisley? This question is not a duplicate of Topologist's Sine Curve not a regular submanifold of $\mathbb{R^2}$? . I read it. However, the concept of connectedness confuses me. As I said in the first paragraph, I want to understand my question with minimal knowledge on topology such as just the definition of open sets, continuous functions and manifolds. Moreover the linked question does not concern my second question.",,"['general-topology', 'manifolds']"

As we have a locally compact Hausdorff space, Baire theorem tells us that at least one of the closed set has non empty interior, i.e. some $\{r\}$ is open.

Transporting the topology $\mathcal T$ on $\Bbb Q^{(\Bbb N)}$ preserves compactness, and we could try to use the projection $\Bbb Q^{(\Bbb N)} \to \Bbb Q$. But I was not sure what to do then.

In particular, such a characterization should not use real numbers. I would like to see in what sense $[0, 1]$ is topologically more important than, for example, the set of rationals, or the complex unit disc. I am especially interested in why the unit interval is so important in the study of compact Hausdorff spaces (metrization, Urysohn's lemma). I have come up with the following one. Start with a definition of path connectedness that does not use $\mathbb R$: $x_1$ and $x_2$ are connected by a path in $X$ if for every Hausdorff compact $C$ and $a,b\in C$, there is a continuous $f\colon C\to X$ such that $f(a)=x_1$ and $f(b)=x_2$.  Now, if $X$ is a Hausdorff space and distinct points $x_1$ and $x_2$ are connected by a path in $X$, then there is a minimal subspace of $X$ in which $x_1$ and $x_2$ are still connected by a path, and every such subspace is homeomorphic to $[0, 1]$. Roughly speaking, $([0, 1], 0, 1)$ is the minimal bi-pointed Hausdorff space such that every bi-pointed Hausdorff compact can be mapped into it with the distinguished points being sent onto the distinguished points. Maybe in some sense it can be also said that $X = [0, 1]$ is the ""minimal"" Hausdorff space such that every Hausdorff compact embeds into $X^N$ for some $N$, but i do not know how to make this precise.
