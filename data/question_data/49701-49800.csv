If this is true, then it would be true for the (I know it's not the exact) definition of a definite integral: $$\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \mathrm{d}x =\lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n}f(x_i^*)\Delta x$$ So I just did a quick verification of a simple definite integral of $x^2$ from $0$ to $1$. Using the Riemann sum definition I got $1/3$ and switching the limits of integration I got $-1/3$ as expected. However, I noticed that if you take $\Delta x$ to always be positive, in the sense that it's a width of a rectangle and couldn't possibly be negative, then the answer either way would be $1/3$. Which, in conclusion, brings me back to my question: wouldn't it be simpler to take $\Delta x$ as a distance or width (always positive) and eliminate this property of integrals? Leaving us with: $$\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \mathrm{d}x =\int_{b}^{a} f(x) \mathrm{d}x$$ To me this makes more sense, because the area under a curve should be maintained when calculated from any direction.",,"['integration', 'definite-integrals', 'area', 'riemann-sum']"

Prove that $f$ is identically zero. The problem provides the following ""hint"": First, show that there exists $\delta > 0$ such that $f$ is zero on $[0,\delta]$. At first I thought the hint seemed a bit odd, as of course $\delta = b$ would answer the whole problem. But then I started thinking that the hint probably meant that, if we could show that $f$ is zero on even a small (right-sided?) neighbourhood of $0$, that that would be enough to show $f$ must remain zero. In particular, the inequality in the problem would force $\lvert f^\prime(\delta) \rvert \leq K\lvert f(\delta)\rvert=0\implies f^\prime(\delta)=0$. But I'm stuck with what to do next because this of course does not alone imply that $f(x)=0$ for $x>\delta$. Proving the hint itself has also evaded me. The wording, to me, implies that there's some property ,other than whatever properties would prove the general problem, we can use to produce this specific $\delta$, because otherwise, the hint would be useless. My first thought was to use the fact that $f$ is continuous at $0$ (and $f(0)=0$): Given $\varepsilon>0$, there exists $\delta>0$ such that $0<x<\delta$ implies $\lvert\,f(x)\rvert<\varepsilon$.  I find myself wanting to use the Mean Value Theorem at this point: there exists $c\in (0,\delta)$ such that $f^\prime(c)=\dfrac{f(\delta)}{\delta}$. We can use the given inequality to produce $$ \frac{\lvert\, f^\prime(\delta)\rvert}{K\delta} \leq\left|\frac{f(\delta)}{\delta}\right| =\lvert\, f^\prime(c)\rvert\leq K\lvert\, f(c)\rvert <K\varepsilon. $$ Now, we could of course use $\varepsilon/K$ in the definition of continuity so that the previous inequality chain ends with $\epsilon$ instead of $K\epsilon$, but that's not the real issue: getting  $\lvert\, f(\delta)\lvert<\delta\varepsilon$ looks promising until I realize that $\delta$ depends on $\varepsilon$, so all this really says is that $\lim\limits_{\delta\to 0^+}f(\delta)=0$, which is quite unsurprising. So I suppose I need help with the hint itself as well as how it implies the result of the problem. I will note that this problem comes from a problem set that is supposed to be on the Riemann integral, but I have no idea how integration would come up here. I think we could claim that either $f(x)\geq 0 \,\forall\, x$ or $f(x)\leq 0 \,\forall\, x$; otherwise, $f$ would have a zero at a point where its derivative is nonzero, contradicting the inequality in the problem.

In method 2 I employed the integration operator on both sides without adding a differential (I know it was already there). If I write $ y'' + 5xy = 2x^2$, is it acceptable to integrate both sides of the equation with respect to y, or x, and get a valid equality as a result? When I write: $ xy + y^x = 2x + 3$, maybe this is bad example, but am I stating that the left side is the same as the right side, or am I proposing that there are certain values of x and y that satisfy that equation. I'm having sort of a fundamental crisis here. I don't think I was ever properly taught what equality means. If you were, where did you learn it?",,"['integration', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'functions', 'derivatives']"
