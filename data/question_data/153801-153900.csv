Some questions I have (among a lot of others): For example, I would really like to know more about the Decomposition Group and the Inertia Group of an ideal $\mathfrak{q}$ over $\mathfrak{p}$. I get the definitions but it is not really clear if these groups are simply subgroups of the Galois group that have arithmetic information encoded in them or if they really help computationally to find some invariants (e,f,g) which would be hard to find without them. Again about the Decomposition and Inertia Groups; It is clear that we are interested in the Decomposition group because we want to find the ideals that get fixed (not pointwise, I know) by the automorphisms of the Galois group. However, It is not clear why would we look at the automorphisms which induce the identity in the quotient ($B/\mathfrak{q})/(A/\mathfrak{p}$) (the elements of the Inertia Group). Is there an intuition for it? What does ramification intuitively mean? I've asked this before but people always try to explain with an example from algebraic geometry (which I don't know nothing about) and I end up without getting it. If someone can answer any of these questions and/or provide me with a reference that goes for intuitive views rather than encyclopedic description, I would appreciate it very much.

By a theorem of Matiyasevich, this problem is unsolvable, in that such an algorithm does not exist. The following naive approach of mine would imply that such an algorithm does exist: Clearly if a polynomial $f \in \mathbb{Z}[X_1, \ldots, X_n]$ has a root $\bar{z} = (z_1, \ldots, z_n) \in \mathbb{Z}^n$ then there is a proof for this in the theory of arithmetic (axiomitized by the Peano axioms, for example). Indeed: just calculate $f(\bar{z})$ and note that this equates to zero.

The number of finite sequences of symbols in the language of arithmetic is countable. Even stronger: a bijection $\varphi$ from $\mathbb{N}$ to this set can be constructed explicitly as the number of symbols is finite, so we can just list all sequences with only 1 symbol, then all sequences with 2 symbols and so on. Now define the following algorithm: for $m = 1,2,3, \ldots$, verify whether $\varphi(m)$ is a valid proof. If so, check if the last line spells ""$f$ has a root in $\mathbb{Z}^n$"" or ""$f$ has no root in $\mathbb{Z}^n$. If so, output YES or NO accordingly. If not, continue with $m+1$ instead of $m$. By my first point, the above algorithm always terminates. Where did I make a mistake, i.e. what part of my argument violates the strict definition of what an algorithm is?

If the extension $L/\mathbb{Q}$ is Galois I think one can show that the answer is yes. In fact I think it is possible to show that for every $I$ there are infinitely many such $\mathcal{P}$'s. The necessary tools for this are class field theory and Chebotarev's density theorem. On the other hand I'm not asking for infinitely many primes, only for one. So to be concrete: Question part B: If the answer to A is yes, is it possible to give a proof that avoids showing that there are infinitely many $\mathcal{P}$'s?

But is there a way in which we might think of this constant as important in its own right, and not come at it 'indirectly;' not approaching it only through other 'loftier' concepts first, or using it as a convenient shorthand for the numerical result of a certain integration or summation process, etc., but through some simple concepts that first lead you to the idea of some important constant, whose more sophisticated properties we can then deduce, and in doing so derive its relations to the transcendental functions, integral and series representations, so that we arrive at the idea of Catalan's constant itself as some important concept in its own right, without appealing to it as kind of a secondary idea? For example, we can do this with $\pi$ and $e$ quite easily. The concept of $\pi$ appears as a simple geometric idea. I only need to understand some basic geometrical ideas, and then it would be only a matter of time before I arrived at the idea of $\pi$ and understood its importance, even if I didn't fully understand the full depth of its importance. The same with $e,$ or even the Euler-Mascheroni constant $\gamma.$ I only need some basic concepts of calculus. With more sophisticated concepts I obviously need more sophisticated prerequisites, but regardless, it is often the case that many fundamental ideas actually have a very simple, and very intuitive germ, which is why you see them pop up again and again, and often there is still some fairly simple relationship between ideas which tells you immediately that something may be important, even if those ideas are themselves not quite 'basic'. With Catalan's constant, I haven't seen any kind of explanation that explains this. It's almost always 'Catalan's constant appears in the evaluation of ...' which only tells you that it is important, but not really where this importance comes from, or why you would be led to care about this constant as anything more than a useful notation for some integral or sum, unlike many other ubiquitous objects in mathematics, where you might first grasp them as an important idea, and then notice their many other uses. Can anyone explain why Catalan's constant is important, or why you would be motivated to care about this constant in its own right?

There are 6 units hence 6 cases, as follows: 1)  $1(c+dw) =  c + dw$ 2) $-1(c+dw) = -c + -dw$ 3)  $w(c+dw) = -d + (c-d)w$ 4) $-w(c+dw) =  d + (d-c)w$ 5)  $-w^2(c+dw) = c-d + cw$ 6)  $w^2(c+dw) = d-c + -cw$ Fortunately, the first two cases can be eliminated. For example, if $u = 1$ then $x-w = c+dw$ so that $d = -1 = 3ab(a-b).$ But this is not possible for integers $a,b$. The same reasoning applies to $u = -1$. For the rest I rely on a program called Mathematica, which perhaps invalidates my reasoning, as you will see. We attack case 5. Here $x = c-d = a^3 + b^3 - 3a^2b$, and $c = a^3 + b^3 - 3ab^2 = -1.$ According to Mathematica the only integer solutions to $c = -1$ are  $(a,b) = (3,2), (1,1), (0,-1), (-1,0), (-1,-3), (-2,1).$ Plugging these into $x = c-d$ we find that no value of x that is greater than 1. So case 5 is eliminated, as is 6 by similar reasoning. Examining case 4 we see that $d-c = -(a^3 + b^3 - 3a^2*b) = -1$ with solutions  $(-2,-3), (-1,-1), (-1,2), (0,1), (1,0), (3,1).$ Plugging these values into $x = d = 3ab(a-b)$ yields only one significant value, namely $x = 18$ (e.g. (a,b)=(3,1) .

Is my conjecture true?","Conjecture: For $N$ sufficiently large, take the set of positive integers up to $N$. Then remove all numbers which have a prime factor larger than $\sqrt{N}$. More than half the set will remain. Example: Suppose I had the set of integers from 1 to 37. Now I keep only the multiples of 2, 3, and 5, disallowing any larger prime factors. I end up with the following set.  $$\{2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,12,15,16,18,20,24, 25,27,30,32,36\} $$ Just over half the set $19/37 = .\overline{513}$ remains. Is my conjecture true?",,['number-theory']
