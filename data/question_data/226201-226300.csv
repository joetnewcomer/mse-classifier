0,All polynomial parametric curves in $k^2$ are contained in affine algebraic varieties,All polynomial parametric curves in  are contained in affine algebraic varieties,k^2,"I have started working through the textbook Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms by Cox, Little, and O'Shea and I am stuck on one part of an introductory question. The question begins by getting one to show (1) If $f(t)$ and $g(t)$ are polynomials of degree $\le n$ in $t$, then for $m$ large enough, the monomials  $$[f(t)]^e[g(t)]^f$$ with $e+f\le m$ form a linearly dependent set in $k[t]$. The next part of the question asks one to deduce (2) If $C\,:\,x=f(t),\,y=g(t)$ is any polynomial parametic curve in $k^2$, then $C$ is contained in $\textbf{V}(F)$ for some $F\in k[x,y]$. I have demonstrated (1), but I am at a loss as to how to use that fact to prove (2). It doesn't seem like it is supposed to be a hard problem, but never the less I am having trouble wrapping my head around it. Additionally I assume that for (2) we are not interested in the trivial solution $F=0$. [Added for completeness] To do part (1), we recognize that if $\deg(f),\deg(g)\le n$, then $$\deg\left([f(t)]^e[g(t)]^f\right)\le ne+nf\le nm$$ Hence if we have more than $nm+1$ polynomials of the form $[f(t)]^e[g(t)]^f$ then we have a dependent set (since $d+1$ is the dimension of the vector space of polynomials of degree less than or equal to $d$). Now we simply count the number of polynomials in this form (this was an exercise before the problem) - it is $\binom{m+2}{2}=\frac{1}{2}(m+1)(m+2)$ from a standard application of stars and bars . Ensuring $m$ large enough (specifically $m>2n-3$) gives us the conclusion.","I have started working through the textbook Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms by Cox, Little, and O'Shea and I am stuck on one part of an introductory question.

The geometric answer is: This normalization describes an affine model $\mathcal Y$ of a curve $Y$ with special fiber $\bar Y=\mathcal Y\otimes\mathbb F_p$, which has a singularity at $(0,0)$. My ideas so far: The curve is nonsingular over $\mathbb Z_p$, so nothing to do there. Over $\mathbb F_p$ we have a double point at $(0,0)$. Normally one gets rid of such a point by introducing somethin like $t:=y/x$. But how do I do this here? I also know the easy examples $y^2=x^3$ and $y^2=x^2(x+1)$.

Given a continuous function $f:X \rightarrow Y$, one has to show there is a natural bijection between $\mathrm{Hom}_X(f^{-1}\mathcal{G},\mathcal{F})$ and $\mathrm{Hom}_Y(\mathcal{G},f_*\mathcal{F})$, where $\mathcal{G}$ is a sheaf over $Y$ and $\mathcal{F}$ a sheaf over $X$. So far I have shown that we have natural maps $f^{-1}f_* \mathcal{F} \rightarrow \mathcal{F}$ and $G \rightarrow f_* f^{-1} G$. I am not completely sure what is meant about naturality.

Then, for this precise section (not for the whole homomorphism), the map between the direct limits is given by assigning a section $t \in \mathcal{G}_2(V)$, with $f(f^{-1}(U))\subset V \subset U$.

So the left hand side of the above were maps of complexes of $k$ vector spaces, corresponding -- if we were without loss of generality allowed to consider everything as living in the derived category of quasicoherent (instead of coherent) sheaves, with enough injectives -- to maps $f_{\ast}\mathcal{I}^{i}\rightarrow k$ if $\mathcal{I}^{\bullet}$ is an injective resolution of $\mathcal{F}$, and such a map again of course induced a map on cohomologies, $H^{i}(X,\mathcal{F})\rightarrow k$ ... In case this works up to here, why would this be reversible, yielding the desired isomorphism (as i still don't see why $\mathbf{R}f_{\ast}\mathcal{F}[i]$ would be concentrated in a single degree)?

58,Projecting an affine hypersurface away from a point in its projective closure is never a finite map?,Projecting an affine hypersurface away from a point in its projective closure is never a finite map?,,"Let $X\subset \mathbb{A}_k^r$ be an irreducible hypersurface defined by a polynomial $g$, where $k$ is an algebraically closed field. Embed $\mathbb{A}^r\hookrightarrow\mathbb{P}^r$ in the usual way. Consider the stereographic projection of $X$ from a point $p$ in $\overline{X}\setminus X$ to some hyperplane not containing $p$, where $\overline{X}$ is $X$'s projective closure. I want to show that this projection is never a finite map from $X$ to this hyperplane.  (This comes from an exercise in Shafarevich, specif. section 1.5 exercise 8 in Basic Algebraic Geometry 1 .) ( Aside: Actually the desired result is false! See Addendum below for revised question.) I have reduced the problem to the following algebraic one, but haven't seen how to complete the proof in these terms. My ideal answer would show me how to fill in the needed steps in this algebraic situation, but I would also be interested to hear more geometric arguments as well. Algebraic reformulation: Let $g$ be an irreducible polynomial in $k[x_1,\dots,x_r]$. Let $L_1,\dots,L_{r-1}$ be $r-1$ linear functions on $\mathbb{A}^r$, and let each $L_j = \ell_j +\alpha_j$ where each $\ell_j$ is a linear form and each $\alpha_j\in k$. Suppose the $\ell_j$'s are linearly independent. Let $g_m$ be $g$'s maximum-degree homogeneous component, and suppose we are given that $g_m$ vanishes on the common zero set of $\ell_1,\dots,\ell_{r-1}$. Prove that in this case, $k[x_1,\dots,x_r]/(g)$ is not finite over the subring generated by the $L_j$'s. Explanation of algebraic reformulation: The $L_j$'s are the restrictions to $\mathbb{A}^r$ of linear forms $L_j'$ on $\mathbb{P}^r$ that, together with $x_0=0$, cut out the point $p$ that is the center of the stereographic projection. Then the projection is, for suitable parametrization of the hyperplane being projected into, given by $(x_0:x_1:\dots:x_r)\mapsto (x_0:L_1':\dots:L_{r-1}')$; so its restriction to $\mathbb{A}^r$ is given by $(x_1,\dots,x_r)\mapsto (L_1,\dots,L_{r-1})$. The fact that $p$ is in $X$'s projective closure is expressed by the condition that when $x_0=0$ and all the $L_j'$'s are zero too, then $g$'s homogenization is zero. This translates into the condition that $g_m$ vanishes when all the $\ell_j$'s vanish. The question of whether the map is finite is then the question of whether $X$'s coordinate ring $k[x_1,\dots,x_r]/(g)$ is finite over the pullback image of $k[y_1,\dots,y_{r-1}]$ (the coordinate ring of the hyperplane), which is the subalgebra generated by the $L_j$'s. Work so far: By the Nullstellensatz, the condition that $g_m$ vanishes when the $\ell_j$'s vanish amounts to saying that $g_m$ is in the radical of the ideal generated by the $\ell_j$'s; call it $L$. It seems to me that this ideal is already radical, since the $\ell_j$'s are homogeneous of degree $1$, though I'm not sure of this. Then $g_m$ is actually in $L$. Also, not every $x_i$ can be in $L$ because since it is a homogeneous ideal, an $x_i$ could only be in $L$ if it is a linear combination of the $\ell_j$'s, but there are only $r-1$ of them and $r$ $x_i$'s, so they cannot span the $k$-vector space containing the $x_i$'s. So, consider an $x_i$ that is not in $L$. If $k[X]$ were finite over the subalgebra generated by the $L$'s, there would be an integral equation for $x_i$ over this subalgebra, occurring in $k[X] = k[x_1,\dots,x_r]/(g)$: $$x_i^s + \sum_{j=0}^{s-1} F_j(L_1,\dots,L_{r-1}) x_i^j = 0$$ Lifting this to an equation in $k[x_1,\dots,x_r]$, and noting that polynomials in the $L_j$'s are equally well polynomials in the $\ell_j$'s (and changing the $F_j$'s accordingly), yields: $$x_i^s + \sum_{j=0}^{s-1} F_j(\ell_1,\dots,\ell_{r-1}) x_i^j = Hg$$ for some $H\in k[x_1,\dots,x_r]$. If I could rig the left side to guarantee that the highest-degree homogeneous component is degree $s$, then this would yield a contradiction: reducing mod $L$ would reduce the degree of the right side but not the left, since $x_i^s\notin L$ (if I am right that $L$ is radical). But this is where I am stuck. Thanks in advance for your thoughts. Addendum, 3/27: It seems that the result is false! user119882 gives more or less the easiest possible counterexample: $r=2$, $L_1=x$, $g=y+x^2$. Clearly $k[x,y]/(y+x^2)$ is finite over the subring $k[L_1] = k[x]$. This is also a counterexample to the original geometric statement: we have a plane conic tangent to the line at infinity; the stereographic projection away from this point of tangency is a finite map (actually an isomorphism) to $\mathbb{A}^1$. Unless I am very very confused, I lifted this statement directly from Shafarevich. The following is on p. 66 of the paperback second edition: Let $X\subset\mathbb{A}^r$ be a hypersurface of $\mathbb{A}^r$ and $L$ a line of $\mathbb{A}^r$ through the origin. Let $\varphi_L$ be the map projecting $X$ parallel to $L$ to an $(r-1)$-dimensional subspace not containing $L$. Write $S$ for the set of all lines $L$ such that $\varphi_L$ is not finite. Prove that $S$ is an algebraic variety. [Hint: Prove that $S = \overline{X}\cap \mathbb{P}^{r-1}_\infty$.] So the parenthetical hint must be wrong! $S$ is a subset of $\overline{X}\cap\mathbb{P}^{r-1}_\infty$ but not necessarily the whole thing!
