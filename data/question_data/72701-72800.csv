26,Is there a categorical characterization of covering maps?,Is there a categorical characterization of covering maps?,,"Given a topological space $X$ , some spaces $S$ will be covering spaces for $X$ and other spaces won't. Furthermore, some continuous maps $\pi: S \rightarrow X$ will be covering maps, and other maps won't be. I'm interested in whether or not these notions (covering space, covering map) can be defined inside the category $\bf{Top}$ ""using only notions of category theory"", that is talking only about objects and morphisms, and without actually looking at the points of the spaces. (We only need to characterize the covering maps inside $\bf{Top}$ , since a space is a covering space of another space iff a covering map exists between them.) The motivation for this question and the reason to think that such a characterization may at all be possible, is due to the well-known lifting properties of covering maps. For example, it is well-known that given a covering map $\pi:S\rightarrow X$ and a path $p:[0,1] \rightarrow X$ in $X$ , there exists a unique path $p':[0,1] \rightarrow S$ in $S$ such that $p=\pi \circ p'$ (the path-lifting property). There's also the homotopy-lifting property of covering maps and some other lifting theorems. Such lifting properties have a very ""categorical"" taste, as they discuss only existence and uniqueness of morphisms in $\bf{Top}$ and guarantee that a certain diagram be commutative. Overall, they 'smell' similar to other constructions in category theory that guarantee the commutativity of a certain diagram (such as limits). However, the path-lifting property itself is not (to my knowledge) unique to covering maps. This raises the question of whether or not some very general 'lifting property' exists that exactly characterizes covering maps, and such a property should (I think) be describable in the language of category theory. To summarize, my questions are: Is there some condition on a morphism in $\bf{Top}$ that can be described in the language of category theory (without quantifying over the elements of a space, as is done in the usual definition of covering maps), that exactly characterizes those morphisms in $\bf{Top}$ that are covering maps? If not, is this possible in some more restricted or similar category? (such as the category of points topological spaces, the category of locally path-connected semilocally simply-connected spaces, or the homotopy category $\bf{hTop}$ )? If such a condition does not exist, is there some category-theoretical explanation for why covering spaces have these lifting properties?","Given a topological space , some spaces will be covering spaces for and other spaces won't.

For $x_1, x_2 \in \Bbb{R}$ (where $x_1 \not= x_2$), if $d$ denotes the distance between these two points, then we can choose an open ball $U_1$ with radius $d/2$ around $x_1$ and an open ball $U_2$ again of radius $d/2$ around $x_2$. Obviously, these two open balls will not intersect at any point. So let $(x_1, x_2, ...), (x'_1, x'_2, ...) \in \Bbb{R^n}$. Then For each $x_i, x'_i \in \Bbb{R}$ (where $i \in \Bbb{N}$), there exist open balls $U_i$ and $U'_i$  in $\Bbb{R}$ around $x_i$ and $x'_i$, respectively, such that the open balls do not intersect. But then $(U_1 \times U_2 \times ...) \cap (U'_1 \times U'_2 \times ...) = \emptyset$. We can show that $\displaystyle\prod_{\Bbb{N}} \Bbb{R}$ is not metrizable by proving that it is not first countable.

So $(\frac{-1}{n}, \frac{1}{n}) \times (\frac{-1}{n}, \frac{1}{n}) \times (\frac{-1}{n}, \frac{1}{n})...$ is a neighborhood of $(0,0,0,0,...)$. But in order to have $U_n \in \{U_n\}_{n \in \Bbb{N}}$ such that $U_n \subseteq (\frac{-1}{n}, \frac{1}{n}) \times (\frac{-1}{n}, \frac{1}{n}) \times (\frac{-1}{n}, \frac{1}{n})...$ for all $n$, we know that the sequence $\{(\frac{-1}{n}, \frac{1}{n}) \times (\frac{-1}{n}, \frac{1}{n}) \times (\frac{-1}{n}, \frac{1}{n})...\}_{n \in \Bbb{N}} = \{U_n\}_{n \in \Bbb{N}}$.

Then prove that $\{x \in X: f(x) =g(x)\}$ is closed in $X$ . Approach: We consider the function $h: X \mapsto \mathbb{R^+}\cup \{0\}$ defined by $h(x)=d_2(f(x),g(x))$ Lemma 1: $h(x)$ is continuous on $X$ . Proof: We have $d_2(f(x),g(x))+d_2(g(x),g(c))+d_2(f(x),f(c))\geq d_2(f(c),g(c))\implies d_2(g(x),g(c))+d_2(f(x),f(c))\geq d_2(f(c),g(c))-d_2(f(x),g(x))$ . Symmetry gives us $d_2(g(x),g(c))+d_2(f(x),f(c))\geq d_2(f(x),g(x))-d_2(f(c),g(c))$ Now, for any $\epsilon>0$ , $\exists$ $\delta>0$ such that $d_2(g(x),g(c))< \epsilon/2$ and $d_2(f(x),f(c))<\epsilon/2$ whenever $d_1(x,c)<\delta$ . Hence, we conclude $\forall \epsilon>0, \ \exists \delta>0$ such that $|h(x)-h(c)|<\epsilon$ whenever $d_1(x,c)<\delta$ , which establishes the lemma. Now, $h(x)=0$ , iff $f(x)=g(x)$ . We know that $\{0\}$ is a closed set in $\mathbb{R^+}\cup \{0\}$ and that the inverse image set of a closed set under a continuous mapping is a closed set. Hence $\{x \in X: h(x)=0\} \equiv \{x \in X: f(x)=g(x)\}$ is a closed set in $X$ . $\mathbf{Follow-up \ question}:$ If $A \subseteq X$ is dense in $X$ and $f(x)=g(x), \forall x \in A$ , then $f=g$ on $X$ .
