3,Can lines connecting nearest neighbors ever cross?,Can lines connecting nearest neighbors ever cross?,,"I don't have any background in graph theory so I am sorry if this is a basic question.  I want to know if lines connecting nearest neighbors can cross in a few different cases. I have convinced myself that if there are no ties for nearest neighbor it is impossible for lines to cross.  Is this correct? I think it might still be impossible even if ties are allowed, in which case either or both lines can be drawn but I haven't come up with solid reasoning to back that up. This case is a bit more complicated.  Say that points can be connected to their second nearest neighbor if a line originating from them has yet to be drawn and they are already connected to their nearest neighbor.  In this condition, two pairs of points very far from one another would be connected into one long line.  Each pair would get a line connecting it to its nearest neighbor and then one or two lines would connect between the pairs.  Connecting to the third nearest neighbor is not allowed.  It seems to me that in this case as well no lines would cross. I have no idea where to begin looking for formal math to back up these statements.  Is there a general theory of lines crossing in a network of nearest neighbor connections?  Any help would be appreciated.","I don't have any background in graph theory so I am sorry if this is a basic question.

5,How quickly we forget - basic trig. Calculate the area of a polygon,How quickly we forget - basic trig. Calculate the area of a polygon,,"I think the easiest way to do this is with trigonometry, but I've forgotten most of the maths I learnt in school.  I'm writing a program (for demonstrative purposes) that defines a Shape, and calculates the interior angles of the shape, based on the number of sides. Now I'm trying to calculate the area based on the length of each of those sides. So given a square, we know it has 4 sides.  And given that the length of each of those sides is 8, we should be able to calculate the area (I know a square is easy... but the same formula needs to work for polygons with more/less sides). What I've done, is this: Calculated the interior angles in the polygon as interior_angle = 180 - (360 / num_sides) . Divided the polygon into an equal number of isosceles triangles and then divided each of those into 2 right-angled triangles, assuming this simplifies the logic.  This is where I'm stuck. Since the interior angle of the polygon is known, I've divided that by 2 in order to get the angle on one corner of these triangles, knowing that there's another angle of 90º.  So my logic tells me: # Polgygon: sides = 4, length = 8 interior_angle = 180 - (360 / sides) = 90 a = interior_angle / 2 = 45 # Given that tan(a) = height / base base = length / 2 = 4 tan(a) = height / base # therefore height = tan(a) * base = tan(45) * 4 This gives me 6.47 as the height (I think that's wrong... shouldn't it just be a round 3?). Now to get the area of the entire polygon, I just have to calculate the area of each triangle and multiple that by the number of sides: area = 0.5 * height * length * sides For my 8 * 8 square, this gives me 51.83 , so I've clearly got my logic wrong.  If there's a simpler way to calculate the area of a uniform polygon, based on the number of sides and the length of each side, please educate me :)  I just need to convert the maths into code for a computer program.","I think the easiest way to do this is with trigonometry, but I've forgotten most of the maths I learnt in school.

7,Mercator versus cylindrical projections,Mercator versus cylindrical projections,,"If I'm not mistaken, the Mercator projection is characterized by these two properties: (1) It is conformal, and (2) It maps curves of constant bearing on the sphere to straight lines in the plane.  I.e. $\theta$ degrees east of north corresponds to a certain slope on the map regardless of where on earth you are. In ""An Application of Geography to Mathematics: History of the Integral of the Secant"", by V. Frederick Rickey and Philip M. Tuchinsky, Mathematics Magazine, v. 53, No. 3, May 1980, pp. 162–166, we find this (the inside quote is from Edward Wright, who wrote some time around the year 1600): ""Consider a cylinder tangent to the earth's equator and imagine the earth to 'swal [swell] like a bladder.' Then identify points on the earth with the points on the cylinder that they come into contact with. Finally, unroll the cylinder; it will be a Mercator map. This model has often been misinterpreted as the cylindrical projection (where a light source at the earth's center projects the unswollen sphere onto its tangent cylinder), but this projection is not conformal."" The description involving ""swelling"" does seem to me to correspond to the cylindrical projection.  What is the difference?  How does ""swelling like a bladder"" give a result different from that given by the cylindrical projection? (As the title suggests, the authors are saying a major motive for integrating the secant function is the Mercator projection.) Note added later: I suppose the two conditions (1) and (2) could be regarded as more simply expressed by saying this: bearings on the globe equal bearings on the map, i.e. if north on the globe corresponds to upward on the map, then $\theta$ degrees east of north on the globe corresponds to $\theta$ degrees clockwise from straight upward on the flat map.  If I'm not mistaken, the Mercator projection is the only projection of which that is true. Still later note: I now find it being speculated in another forum where I asked about this, that the cylinder is viewed as something like a solid material, so that the swelling balloon clings to the sides of the cylinder rather than passing through it.  I had imagined a spherical balloon expanding while retaining its spherical shape, so that progressively more of the sphere is outside the cylinder.  Each point on the sphere would pass through (""touch"") the cylinder once, and that point on the cylinder would be the image of that point on the sphere.  It seems altogether unclear how that would determine the projection, and if that's what R & T had in mind, or what Wright had in mind, that's not at all clear from R & T's paper.","If I'm not mistaken, the Mercator projection is characterized by these two properties: (1) It is conformal, and (2) It maps curves of constant bearing on the sphere to straight lines in the plane.

15,Minimal area of hexagon with each side 1 unit away from a point,Minimal area of hexagon with each side 1 unit away from a point,,"I need to find the minimal area of a convex hexagon with all of its sides 1 unit away from a point. Here's what I've done so far. I think this is equivalent to asking for the minimal area of a hexagon circumscribed around a circle with radius 1, since then all of its sides will be 1 unit away from the center of the circle. Intuitively, it looks like a regular hexagon would minimize the area, and playing around in GeoGebra seems to support this. However, I'm having trouble proving this result formally. I've tried two things so far: One, starting with a regular hexagon and moving one of the points of tangency along the circle. If we overlap the regular hexagon with this new hexagon, there is a triangle of added area and a triangle of lost area. I've tried to show that the lost area is greater than the gained area, but I haven't been able to find a way to get the area of either triangle. Second, I split the hexagon into 12 triangles. In a regular hexagon, each triangle would have an area of $\frac{\tan 30 ^{\circ}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{6}$ . I tried to show that if we change the central angle, the area will decrease, but this gave me the opposite of what I wanted - if the angle is $45^{\circ}$ , for example, the area of the triangle would be $\frac{1}{2}$ , which is greater than the previous result.

Here's what I've done so far. I think this is equivalent to asking for the minimal area of a hexagon circumscribed around a circle with radius 1, since then all of its sides will be 1 unit away from the center of the circle. Intuitively, it looks like a regular hexagon would minimize the area, and playing around in GeoGebra seems to support this. However, I'm having trouble proving this result formally. I've tried two things so far: One, starting with a regular hexagon and moving one of the points of tangency along the circle. If we overlap the regular hexagon with this new hexagon, there is a triangle of added area and a triangle of lost area. I've tried to show that the lost area is greater than the gained area, but I haven't been able to find a way to get the area of either triangle. Second, I split the hexagon into 12 triangles. In a regular hexagon, each triangle would have an area of . I tried to show that if we change the central angle, the area will decrease, but this gave me the opposite of what I wanted - if the angle is , for example, the area of the triangle would be , which is greater than the previous result.

However, it does not look very nice because it requires long extensions of two sides. So I decided to make it less intrusive (in the sense of ""less occupied space outside the pentagon"") as follows. Let $r,t,s$ be the lengths of three consecutive sides of a quadrilateral, with $108^\circ=\frac{3\pi}5$ angles between them: Then it is easy to show that the fourth side length $u$ is $$\sqrt{\left((r+s)\cos\frac{2\pi}5+t\right)^2+\left((r-s)\sin\frac{2\pi}5\right)^2}$$ We want all four side lengths to be rational (but they can be negative). If $u$ is rational, so is $u^2$ , so the expression inside the square root must also be rational. Expanding it gives $$r^2+s^2+t^2-\frac{rs+rt+st}2+\frac{\sqrt5}2(rt+st-rs)$$ and for this to be rational we must have $rt+st-rs=0$ or $t=\frac{rs}{r+s}$ . Making this substitution gives $$u=\sqrt{\frac{r^4+r^3s+r^2s^2+rs^3+s^4}{r^2+2rs+s^2}}$$ Clearly we can scale any solution $(r,s,t,u)$ by any rational number, so we set $r=1$ arbitrarily: $$u=\sqrt{\frac{s^4+s^3+s^2+s+1}{s^2+2s+1}}=\frac{\sqrt{s^4+s^3+s^2+s+1}}{|s+1|}$$ Thus, up to scale, all rational solutions correspond one-to-one with solutions of $$s^4+s^3+s^2+s+1=y^2\qquad s,y\in\mathbb Q,s\not\in\{0,-1\}\tag1$$ The same equation has been posed on this site before , but only with integers, and I could not find any good reference in this answer .

77,n-by-n degree grid on a sphere?,n-by-n degree grid on a sphere?,,"I've been trying to generate an evenly spaced grid centred at a given point on a sphere, such that the angular separation between any neighbouring pair of points is the same (e.g., 1 degree). The grid should be oriented with the central column of points along the same meridian as the given point. I have little experience with spherical trigonometry (aside from knowing about the Haversine formula and the spherical law of cosines) but after some reading I'm fairly certain that each cell will require four unique great circle arcs. The previous approach I followed using vectors only found great circles perpendicular to the central column (like the coloured grids shown in the first plot) and so the points were not evenly spaced, especially at the edges. Each point in the second plot (showing the result of my latest attempt) is plotted with a 1 degree-radius circle surrounding it, which ideally should coincide with the surrounding four points. The updated method described below finally generates a regular grid. However, for a 20-by-20 degree grid the angular separation of the corner point to the central column is ~4.5 arcseconds smaller than the ideal 10 degree separation. Does anyone know of a method that can determine the required grid points to greater precision? Current method: The procedure I've followed so far to generate the n-by-n degree grid centred at a given point (e.g. longitude=0, latitude=0; let's call this point A) involves three stages: Note: a 10-by-10 degree grid would consist of 11-by-11 points each separated from the nearest four points in the adjacent rows and columns by 1 degree. All calculations assume a sphere of radius 1. Find the points along the `central' column: Simply increment the latitude (i.e. following the meridian running through the centre point) and wrap the latitude and longitude if a pole is crossed (i.e. if the current point's latitude is less than -90 or greater than +90). Find the points along the `central' row (through the grid centre):  Since the row of points through A follow a great circle that intersects the meridian at a right angle, we need to find the plane that this second great circle lies on. Consider two points at the given central longitude; let point A be the grid centre at 0 degrees longitude and 0 degrees latitude, and point B at 0 degrees longitude and 1 degree north. The two points can be expressed in Cartesian coordinates, and so the unit vector (N) normal to the great circle that contains A and B is found using the cross product, i.e. N = BxA. The cross product of the unit vector N with a unit vector in the direction of A gives another normal vector (M). The vector M can then be used as an axis to rotate N by (90-x) degrees^, where x is the offset (in this case 1 deg) from the central column. This is repeated outwards in steps of 1 degree for one half of the central row then the other half using a unit vector in the opposite direction to N. ^ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix#Rotation_matrix_from_axis_and_angle Fill in the remaining points in each quadrant: Each point in the grid forms a rectangle lying on the same plane as three other points in the grid - let A be the point at the grid centre, B is a point 'above' or 'below' A in the same column and C is a point on the central row, and the unknown point D is in the same row as B and same column as C. For the upper left quadrant, the rectangle (sometimes a square) would have corners clockwise from the upper-left D, B, A, and C. First compute vectors AB and AC then a unit vector normal to the triangle BAC can be found from their cross-product, i.e. t=ABxAC. To find D, the approach I've used is to rotate the plane on which A/B/C/D lie to align it with the xy-plane. The rotation matrix requires a rotation axis and rotation angle that I found here: https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/a/48102 The dot product of the rotation matrix and each of vectors A, B and C allows vector D' (the equivalent of vector D in the xy-plane) to be found from their components, i.e., $D' = (b_x-a_x+c_x, b_y-a_y+c_y, b_z-a_z+c_z)$ The dot product of the rotation matrix using the same rotation axis but rotation angle of opposite sign to that given above with vector D' gives the coordinates of vector D, which can be converted to the latitude and longitude for point D. This is repeated for every remaining point in the four quadrants. I've spent a few days looking for a better method but without any luck. Fig 1. Sphere with grids: Fig 2. Grid points - note circles shown are 1 degree in radius (i.e. the perimeter of a 1 degree spherical cap centred at the given grid point). I had used a gnomonic projection to present the grid in figure 2 (using the python plotting package APLpy) but replaced it with an orthographic projection since the former shows great circles as straight lines but in this case the rows of points are joined by different great circle arcs, except the (n/2+1)th row.","I've been trying to generate an evenly spaced grid centred at a given point on a sphere, such that the angular separation between any neighbouring pair of points is the same (e.g., 1 degree). The grid should be oriented with the central column of points along the same meridian as the given point. I have little experience with spherical trigonometry (aside from knowing about the Haversine formula and the spherical law of cosines) but after some reading I'm fairly certain that each cell will require four unique great circle arcs. The previous approach I followed using vectors only found great circles perpendicular to the central column (like the coloured grids shown in the first plot) and so the points were not evenly spaced, especially at the edges. Each point in the second plot (showing the result of my latest attempt) is plotted with a 1 degree-radius circle surrounding it, which ideally should coincide with the surrounding four points. The updated method described below finally generates a regular grid. However, for a 20-by-20 degree grid the angular separation of the corner point to the central column is ~4.5 arcseconds smaller than the ideal 10 degree separation. Does anyone know of a method that can determine the required grid points to greater precision? Current method: The procedure I've followed so far to generate the n-by-n degree grid centred at a given point (e.g. longitude=0, latitude=0; let's call this point A) involves three stages: Note: a 10-by-10 degree grid would consist of 11-by-11 points each separated from the nearest four points in the adjacent rows and columns by 1 degree. All calculations assume a sphere of radius 1. Find the points along the `central' column: Simply increment the latitude (i.e. following the meridian running through the centre point) and wrap the latitude and longitude if a pole is crossed (i.e. if the current point's latitude is less than -90 or greater than +90). Find the points along the `central' row (through the grid centre):  Since the row of points through A follow a great circle that intersects the meridian at a right angle, we need to find the plane that this second great circle lies on. Consider two points at the given central longitude; let point A be the grid centre at 0 degrees longitude and 0 degrees latitude, and point B at 0 degrees longitude and 1 degree north. The two points can be expressed in Cartesian coordinates, and so the unit vector (N) normal to the great circle that contains A and B is found using the cross product, i.e. N = BxA. The cross product of the unit vector N with a unit vector in the direction of A gives another normal vector (M). The vector M can then be used as an axis to rotate N by (90-x) degrees^, where x is the offset (in this case 1 deg) from the central column. This is repeated outwards in steps of 1 degree for one half of the central row then the other half using a unit vector in the opposite direction to N. ^ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix#Rotation_matrix_from_axis_and_angle Fill in the remaining points in each quadrant: Each point in the grid forms a rectangle lying on the same plane as three other points in the grid - let A be the point at the grid centre, B is a point 'above' or 'below' A in the same column and C is a point on the central row, and the unknown point D is in the same row as B and same column as C. For the upper left quadrant, the rectangle (sometimes a square) would have corners clockwise from the upper-left D, B, A, and C. First compute vectors AB and AC then a unit vector normal to the triangle BAC can be found from their cross-product, i.e. t=ABxAC. To find D, the approach I've used is to rotate the plane on which A/B/C/D lie to align it with the xy-plane. The rotation matrix requires a rotation axis and rotation angle that I found here: https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/a/48102 The dot product of the rotation matrix and each of vectors A, B and C allows vector D' (the equivalent of vector D in the xy-plane) to be found from their components, i.e., $D' = (b_x-a_x+c_x, b_y-a_y+c_y, b_z-a_z+c_z)$ The dot product of the rotation matrix using the same rotation axis but rotation angle of opposite sign to that given above with vector D' gives the coordinates of vector D, which can be converted to the latitude and longitude for point D. This is repeated for every remaining point in the four quadrants. I've spent a few days looking for a better method but without any luck. Fig 1. Sphere with grids: Fig 2.

But I guess my question is then that is there some sort of underlying (physical) reason for the exponent $2$?","So $$a^2+ b ^2 =c^2$$ in a right triangle, but where does the power $2$ come from?

95,Revolve a 3D shape around an axis to create a 4D shape (and so on and so fourth),Revolve a 3D shape around an axis to create a 4D shape (and so on and so fourth),,"You can revolve a 2 dimensional shape around an axis to make it a 3 dimensional shape, and finding the volume of this shape is pretty simple using the disk method. What I want to know is if it is viable to use a similar method to find the space taken up by a 4 dimensional shape created by revolving a 3 dimensional shape about an axis. Then would I be able to revolve that shape to create a 4 dimensional shape? What form would the equation need to take if it is possible? The shapes I want to do this with have been obtained using the disk method out of a 2D shape, so they are infinitely rotationally symmetrical about an axis (let's go with the y axis). Basically what I want to do is take a 2D shape and revolve it into n dimensions. As an example we can take a circle going to a sphere going to a 4-sphere going to a 5-sphere and so on. Is this possible or am I thinking madness?","You can revolve a 2 dimensional shape around an axis to make it a 3 dimensional shape, and finding the volume of this shape is pretty simple using the disk method.

Each point has 3dof taken by itself and it seems that when one of them is chosen, there's no constraint on choosing the 2nd one, so why aren't there 6dof?
