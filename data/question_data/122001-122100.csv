0,Minimum square sum of inscripted triangle,Minimum square sum of inscripted triangle,,"Problem: In a right triangle $ABC$ , the hypotenuse is long $4$ and the angle in $B$ is $30°$ . Calling $N$ the midpoint on the side $AB$ (the hypotenuse), and $M$ the middle point on the side $CB$ , consider a random point on the side $AC$ , lets call it $P$ and $AP = x$ . Find the value of $x$ such that is minimum the sum of the squares of the sides of triangle $PNM$ . My Solution so far : I have to minimise $NM^2+NP^2 + PM^2$ and $NM$ is fixed and equal to $1$ , so I should only care about $NP$ and $MP$ $ABC$ is a right triangle with two angles of one angle of $30°$ then the other angle will be $60°$ and therefore the side $AC$ is half the hypotenuse, therefore $AC=2$ , and from this follow that $CB = 2 \sqrt{3}$ $PM$ is the hypothenuse of the right triangle $CPM$ and therefore its equation is $PM^2 = CM^2 + PC^2 = (\sqrt{3})^2 + (2-x)^2 = x^2 -4x + 7$ But now I'm stuck since I don't know how to correctly parametrise $PN$ as a function of $AP$ . Once found a way to write $PN$ as a function of $AP$ I'm done, since I can write them inside my, equation, take the derivative and find the minimum of the function of $AP$ Final Solution : Thanks to @mathlove, the triangle $APN$ , can be solved by using the Law of Cosines , in our case used on the side $PN$ and with angle $\beta$ it results in: \begin{equation}\begin{aligned}  PN^2 &= AP^2 + AN^2 - 2\cdot AP\cdot AN\cdot cos(\beta) = \\  &= x^2 + 2^2 - 4xcos(60) =\\ &= x^2 -2x + 4 \end{aligned}\end{equation} Now I finally have an equation of both $PN^2$ and $PM^2$ both depending on $x$ and therefore I can find the minimum: \begin{equation}\begin{aligned} PN^2+PM^2 &= x^2 -2x + 4 + x^2 -4x +7 = \\ & = 2x^2 + -6x + 11   \end{aligned}\end{equation} Which by deriving in $x$ we obtain $4x -6 = 0$ which implies $x = 3/2$","Problem: In a right triangle , the hypotenuse is long and the angle in is .

1,Proportions of ornamental gables in gothic architecture,Proportions of ornamental gables in gothic architecture,,"I'm trying to figure out mathematically precise proportions for gothic architecture-style gables. The gable has the shape of a triangle. There is a central incircle, as well as a smaller incircle in the remaining space at the top. The legs of the triangle are tangent to two additional circles of the same radius as the smaller circle at the top, which are also tangent to the central incircle. If the base of the triangle is drawn so that it is tangent to the central incircle, then the two neighboring circles at the bottom are cut exactly in half. I hope the image makes it more clear. Now, my question is: for any given base or height of the triangle, or for any given radius of the central incircle, what is the radius of the smaller circles? Since the legs of the triangle are tangent to 3 circles on either side, which also touch, and since the smaller circles are of the same size, I feel like there should be exactly one answer where the proportions exactly match. I've tried a few things but my maths is a bit rusty and I can't seem to make a lot of progress. :/ I'd be grateful even for a suggestion from which direction to tackle this problem.","I'm trying to figure out mathematically precise proportions for gothic architecture-style gables.

Look at it from the top, and cut along the circle $R$ traces when spun around the center of the torus, and we get the inner and outer half of a torus, inner half clearly with less volume compared to the outer half. Another similar torus $B$ with $R=\frac{13}{2}$ and $r=0.0005$ is also cut in a similar manner. The outer half clearly has more volume than the inner half. (I have noted that the different halves are not equal to the volume of half cylinders since one side is flat and thus the volume displacement will not be equal to the original.) Now, I calculate the volumes of the inner half of A, and the outer half of B using shell integration by setting the center of the torus at $(0,0)$ and rotating the equation of a circle about the line $x=0$ , and get $2\cdot\int^{5.5}_{5.4995}\left(2\pi\cdot x\cdot\sqrt{.0005^2-\left(x-\frac{11}{2}\right)^2}\right)\text{ d}x=\frac{\pi(8250\pi-1)}{6000000000}$ and $2\cdot\int^{6.5005}_{6.5}\left(2\pi\cdot x\cdot\sqrt{.0005^2-\left(x-\frac{13}{2}\right)^2}\right)\text{ d}x=\frac{\pi(9750\pi+1)}{6000000000}$ respectively.

You also know the length of the edges that converge on this same vertex. Given that, calculate all dihedral angles. From This question and its accepted answer I can get three of the six dihedral angles. I am trying to figure out the rest (the ones at the ""base""). I tried adapting the answer for that question, extending the definition of $\vec v_1$ , $\vec v_2$ , $\vec v_3$ , so that now they are not unit vectors, but their magnitude is the length of the edges. Then we could similarly define a unit normal vector for the ""base"" as: $$\vec n_{12}=\dfrac{\vec v_1 \times \vec v_2}{|\vec v_1 \times \vec v_2|}  \quad\text{and} \quad \vec n_{b}=\dfrac{\vec v_1 \times \vec v_2 + \vec v_2 \times \vec v_3 + \vec v_3 \times \vec v_1}{|\vec v_1 \times \vec v_2 + \vec v_2 \times \vec v_3 + \vec v_3 \times \vec v_1|}$$ so then, similar to that answer: $$\text{cos}(θ_{ab})=-\vec n_{12}\cdot \vec n_{b}$$ But this hasn´t taken me very far.

So at the end I was a disapointed in both of them, can somebody advice a better reference than the two above? I am specially interested in geometrical terms, and do like figures and construction instructions,  my budget is about the price of the two above together, systematic dictionaries (terms related to one object put together) would be even better.
