2,Smooth projective surface whose hyperplane sections are elliptic curves is ruled,Smooth projective surface whose hyperplane sections are elliptic curves is ruled,,"This is a problem from chapter 6 in Beauville's book Complex Algebraic Surfaces . I have a smooth projective surface $S$ whose smooth hyperplane sections $H$ are elliptic curves. I want to show that $S$ is either a del Pezzo surface or is an elliptic ruled surface. I want to proceed by the hint in the book. I have managed to show that $q=h^1(S,\mathcal O_S)\le 1$ by looking at two holomorphic 1-forms, restricting them to the hyperplane sections, doing some stuff and getting that they have to be proportional everywhere. Now I want to take care of the cases $q=0$ and $q=1$ separately. When $q=0$ , Beauville suggests that I show that $K\equiv -H$ , i.e. that the canonical class is the negative of $H$ in $\mathrm{Pic}(S)$ . This would solve this part of the problem because I have a result from an exercise a while ago saying if $K\equiv -H$ then $S$ is a del Pezzo surface. The problem is that I'm not sure how to go about showing this. The best I can think of is to show that $H=-K$ in cohomology, which would suffice because the Chern class map $\mathrm{Pic}(S)\to H^2(S,\mathbb Z)$ is an injection since $q=0$ . However I'm not sure how this helps. To be frank, I don't know how to go abut showing two divisor classes are the same if I don't have some explicit description for them. For the case $q=1$ , I'm hoping that the previous part will show me that $H.K<0$ in general or something, as this would imply that $S$ is ruled. I haven't thought too much about this part to be honest. Any help is appreciated.

4,Canonical lift of Elliptic curve in Smart attack,Canonical lift of Elliptic curve in Smart attack,,"Smart attack details Given some curve $E/\mathbb F_p$ with order $p$ , lift it to $E_0=E/\mathbb Q_p$ and define the subgroups of $E/\mathbb Q_p$ : $E_r=\{(x,y)\in E/\mathbb Q_p|v_p(x)\leq-2r,v_p(y)\leq-3r\}\cup\{\infty\}$ . We have the following isomorphism of groups: $\frac{E_0}{E_1}\cong E/\mathbb F_p$ and $\frac{E_1}{E_2}\cong\mathbb F^+_p$ , which the first isomorphism given by reduction mod $p$ last isomorphism given by $\psi:(x,y)\to -\frac x{py}\pmod p$ Assume that $kP=Q$ in $E/\mathbb F_p$ , typically if we are only given $P,Q$ , findiing $k$ is computationally hard. However since $E/\mathbb F_p$ is anomalous, Smart attack gives us a simple solution: After lifting the curve to $E/\mathbb Q_p$ , let $\tilde P,\tilde Q$ be the lifted points of $P,Q$ respectively, then we have $p\tilde P,p\tilde Q,k\tilde P-\tilde Q\in E_1$ since $E/\mathbb F_p$ is of order $p$ . Furthermore, since $k\psi(p\tilde P)-\psi(p\tilde Q)=p\psi(k\tilde P-\tilde Q)=0$ , we get that $k=\frac{\psi(p\tilde Q)}{\psi(p\tilde P)}\pmod p$ , which is pretty simple to compute. When the attack fails The proof fails if $pP\in E_2$ , since we get $k=\frac00$ . This is noted in the Smart attack 's paper, where he notes that for 'canonical lifts', such points exist, and 'canonical lifts' occur at a frequency of $\frac1p$ . An example of such a lift can be found at the crypto SE question why the Smart attack fails for a particular lift . My question is why does hitting the canonical lift cause the attack to fail(which was answered in the comments), and why does it happen with a $\frac1p$ probability?

Because the blow-up map $\tilde{X} \to X$ is an isomorphism away from $0$ and $X$ is normal Gorenstein the canonical divisor is supported on the exceptional divisor $E$ of the blowup, i.e. $K_{\tilde{X}} = k E$ for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ . The question is then: what is $k$ ? My idea was: we know that $K_Y = 2 E'$ where $E'$ is the exeptional divisor on $Y$ (general fact about the canonical of a blow-up of a smooth variety along a smooth subvariety). As $\tilde{X}$ is a smooth divisor on $Y$ , by the adjunction formula we get $K_{\tilde X} = (2 E' + \tilde{X})|_{\tilde{X}}$ , but here I am stuck. Can anyone point me to how to proceed?

There is a line where I'm lost and I can't understand where the things the author says come from. Context Let $X$ be a topological space and $B$ a base of its topology, considered as a category with inclusion maps as morphisms. A presheaf on $B$ is just a contravariant functor $\mathcal{F}:B\to \mathcal{C}$ , where $\mathcal{C}$ is any category that admits projective limits. Denote by $\rho^U_V:\mathcal{F}(U)\to\mathcal{F}(V)$ the restriction morphisms. From this we can define a presheaf $\mathcal{F}'$ on $X$ by setting $\mathcal{F}'(U)=\varprojlim\mathcal{F}(V)$ , where $V\subseteq U$ and $V\in B$ . In the proof of 0-3.2.2, the author bassicaly shows that this definition doesn't depend on $B$ and therefore it fulfills the condition needed to be a sheaf with the following hypothesis: For every covering $(U_\alpha)$ of $U\in B$ by sets $U_\alpha\in B$ contained in $U$ , and for every object $T\in\mathcal{C}$ , the map that sends every $f\in\mathrm{Hom}(T,\mathcal{F}(U))$ to the family $(\rho^U_{U_\alpha}\circ f)\in\prod\mathrm{Hom}(T,\mathcal{F}(U_\alpha))$ is a bijection onto the the family $(f_\alpha)$ such that $\rho^{U_\alpha}_V\circ f_\alpha=\rho^{U_\beta}_V\circ f_\beta$ for every pair of indices $(\alpha,\beta)$ and every $V\in B$ with $V\subseteq U_\alpha\cap U_\beta$ . In order to do that, he chooses a base $B'\subseteq B$ , and defines $\mathcal{F}''$ in the same way as $\mathcal{F}'$ but taking projective limit over the elements of $B'$ . Question For every open set $U$ there is a morphism $\mathcal{F}'(U)\to\mathcal{F}''(U)$ which is the projective limit of $\mathcal{F}'(U)\to\mathcal{F}(V)$ for $V\in B'$ .

68,Concerning the subalgebra generated by two elements,Concerning the subalgebra generated by two elements,,"Let $f=f(t),g=g(t) \in \mathbb{C}[t]$ be two separable polynomials of degrees $\deg(f)=n \geq 2$ and $\deg(g)=m \geq 2$ , namely, $f$ has $n$ distinct roots and $g$ has $m$ distinct roots. Denote $d=d(t)=\gcd(f(t),g(t))$ , and assume that $\deg(d)=l \geq 1$ . Assume that $d(t)=(t-\gamma_1)\cdots(t-\gamma_l)$ ,  so we can write $f(t)=(t-\gamma_1)\cdots(t-\gamma_l)(t-\alpha_1)\cdots(t-\alpha_{n-l})$ and $g(t)=(t-\gamma_1)\cdots(t-\gamma_l)(t-\beta_1)\cdots(t-\beta_{m-l})$ , where $\{\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_{n-l},\beta_1,\ldots,\beta_{m-l},\gamma_1,\cdots,\gamma_l\}$ are distinct. Further assume that $\mathbb{C}(f,g)=\mathbb{C}(t)$ . Are there nice (necessary and sufficient) conditions for $\mathbb{C}[f,g]=\mathbb[t]$ ? Examples: (1) $f=t(t-1)(t+1)=t(t^2-1)=t^3-t, g=t(t-i)(t+i)=t(t^2+1)=t^3+t$ We have $f-g=t^3-t-(t^3+t)=-2t$ , so $\mathbb{C}[f,g]=\mathbb{C}[t]$ . (2) $f=(t+1)t(t-1), g=(t+1)(t+2)(t-2)$ . By this we get that $\mathbb{C}(f,g)=\mathbb{C}(t)$ (since $\deg(d)=1$ ). Here $\mathbb{C}[f,g]\neq \mathbb{C}[t]$ , since the D-resultant of $f$ and $g$ is $s(s+1)$ , and a necessary and sufficient condition for $\mathbb{C}[f,g]=\mathbb{C}[t]$ is that the D-resultant of $f$ and $g$ is a non-zero scalar (namely, $\in \mathbb{C}^{\times}$ ), see Theorem 2.1 . Several ideas: One plausible answer is to adjust that Theorem 2.1 to our special case; however, computing the D-resultant is very complicated for higher degrees of $f$ and $g$ , or maybe I am missing something and the D-resultant is nicer that I thought? What about sub-resultants ? (I think I can obtain a nice condition involving sub-resultants) but again in higher degrees the computations are complicated. What about SAGBI bases; it seems that $\{f,g\}$ is not a SAGBI basis, but does this tell something intersting? By Abhyankar-Moh-Suzuki theroem, $m$ must divide $n$ or vice versa. A related question is this question, which asks: For which $f,g \in k[t]$ , $k[f,g]$ is integrally closed in its field of fractions $k(f,g)=k(t)$ ? Notice that, in our case, if $\mathbb{C}[f,g]$ is integrally closed in $\mathbb{C}(f,g)$ , then, since here $\mathbb{C}(f,g)=\mathbb{C}(t)$ , we obtain that $t$ , which is obviously integral over $\mathbb{C}[f,g]$ , already belongs to $\mathbb{C}[f,g]$ , hence $\mathbb{C}[f,g]=\mathbb{C}[t]$ . See also this question. Special cases are also wellcome. Plausible special cases: (1) $\deg(d)=1$ : Notice that in each of the two examples $\deg(d)=1$ , but this does not help in determinig if $\mathbb{C}[f,g]=\mathbb{C}[t]$ or not, because in the first example we have $\mathbb{C}[f,g]=\mathbb{C}[t]$ , while in the second example we have $\mathbb{C}[f,g]\neq\mathbb{C}[t]$ . Perhaps I am missing a nice criterion that distinguishes between those two examples? (2) Special forms of $f$ and/or $g$ , for example $f(t)=t^n+at^{\tilde{n}}+b$ and $g(t)=t^m+ct^{\tilde{m}}+d$ . Any hints and comments are welcome! As promised in the comments, I now prove the following claim: Claim: Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero and let $f=f(t),g=g(t) \in k[t]$ be such that $f'$ and $g'$ are not simultaneously zero (this, in some cases, implies that $k(f,g)=k(t)$ ). Then the following two conditions are equivalent: (i) $k[f,g]=k[t]$ . (ii) For all $\lambda,\mu \in k$ , we have $\deg(\gcd(f-\lambda,g-\mu)) \leq 1$ . Proof: Lemma (it is necessary to assume that $k$ is algebraically closed): $k[f,g]=k[t]$ if and only if $f'$ and $g'$ are not simultaneously zero and $\psi: t \mapsto (f(t),g(t))$ is injective. (i) implies (ii): Denote $F_{\lambda}=F_{\lambda}(t):=f(t)-\lambda$ and $G_{\mu}=G_{\mu}(t):=g(t)-\mu$ . From $k[f,g]=k[t]$ follows that, for all $\lambda,\mu \in k$ , $k[F_\lambda,G_\mu]=k[f-\lambda,g-\mu]=k[t]$ By the lemma we get that, for all $\lambda,\mu \in k$ , $\psi_{\lambda,\mu}: t \mapsto (F_\lambda(t),G_\mu(t))$ is injective. Assume that there exist $\lambda_0,\mu_0 \in k$ such that $\deg(\gcd(F_{\lambda_0},G_{\mu_0}))=\deg(\gcd(f-\lambda_0,g-\mu_0)) \geq 2$ . Then there exist $a,b \in k$ , with $a \neq b$ (otherwise, $a$ is a common root of $f'$ and $g'$ contrary to our assumption that they are not simultaneously zero) , such that $(t-a)(t-b)$ divides both $F_{\lambda_0}$ and $G_{\mu_0}$ .

Then, $F_{\lambda_0}(a)=f(a)-\lambda_0=0$ and $F_{\lambda_0}(b)=f(b)-\lambda_0=0$ , so $(t-a)(t-b)$ divides $F_{\lambda_0}$ , and $G_{\mu_0}(a)=g(a)-\mu_0=0$ and $G_{\mu_0}(b)=g(b)-\mu_0=0$ , so $(t-a)(t-b)$ divides $G_{\mu_0}$ . We obtained that $(t-a)(t-b)$ divides $\gcd(F_{\lambda_0},G_{\mu_0})=\gcd(f-\lambda_0,g-\mu_0)$ , so $\deg(\gcd(f-\lambda_0,g-\lambda_0)) \geq 2$ ,  a contradiction.","Let be two separable polynomials of degrees and , namely, has distinct roots and has distinct roots.

The main task is to show that every vector bundle $F$ can be written as an element of $A(X) \oplus \mathbb{Z}$ . If $F$ were generated by its sections, then we can consider an appropriate trivial bundle $\mathcal{O}^r$ such that $\mathcal{O}^r \to F$ is an isomorphism on an open set and so, we'll have - $$0 \to \mathcal{O}^r \to F \to \Theta \to 0$$ where $\Theta$ is going to be the structure sheaf of a divisor. Thus $F \in A(X) \oplus \mathbb{Z}$ . Now, for a general $F$ , some high twist $F(n)$ is going to be generated by its sections and so, $F(n) \in A(X) \oplus \mathbb{Z}$ . Then, he says ""It is clear that every element of $A(X)$ has square zero in $K(X)$ ( $K(X)$ has a ring structure given by tensor product).

How to get this?  If this is true, then I guess we can compute the tensor product in the display above to get that $f^*(\mathcal O_{\mathbb P^1_k}(1))({\rm Spec}(R))$ consists of rational functions of the form $$\frac{g(x^n,y^n)}{h(x^n,y^n)} \cdot \frac{p(x,y)}{q(x,y)},$$ where $p$ and $q$ are homogeneous of the same degree.  But why are these all the rational functions $\frac{r(x,y)}{s(x,y)}$, where $r$ and $s$ are homogeneous with $deg(r)-deg(s)=n$?","Let $k$ be a field and consider the degree $n$ map $f: \mathbb P^1_k \to \mathbb P^1_k$ given by $(x:y) \mapsto (x^n: y^n)$.  I want to show that $f^*(\mathcal O_{\mathbb P^1_k}(1)) \simeq \mathcal O_{\mathbb P^1_k}(n)$. My attempt is as follows:  by definition, we have to calculate  $$f^*(\mathcal O_{\mathbb P^1_k}(1)) = f^{-1}(\mathcal O_{\mathbb P^1_k}(1)) \otimes_{f^{-1}(\mathcal O_{\mathbb P^1_k})} \mathcal O_{\mathbb P^1_k},$$ so we have to describe the sections of this sheaf over every affine open set $U = {\rm Spec}(R)$ and show that they agree with $\mathcal O_{\mathbb P^1_k}(n)({\rm Spec}(R))$.  How to describe these sections?  I guess the sections of $f^{-1}(\mathcal O_{\mathbb P^1_k}(1))({\rm Spec}(R)))$ given by rational functions of the form $g(x^n,y^n)/h(x^n,y^n) \in R(x,y)$ where $g(x,y)$ and $h(x,y)$ are homogeneous polynomials with $deg(g) - deg(h) = 1$; is this correct?

96,What does this notation for full set of sections mean?,What does this notation for full set of sections mean?,,"In Katz & Mazur's book ""Arithmetic Moduli of Elliptic Curves"", available here , the definition of a full set of sections is given on page 33. I would like to make sure I understand the notations well. The context is the following: Let $S$ be a scheme and $Z/S$ a finite locally free scheme over $S$ of rank $N\geq 1$. This means that for any affine $S$-scheme $\operatorname{Spec}(R)\rightarrow S$, the $R$-scheme $Z_R/R$ obtained from $Z/S$ by base change is of the form $Spec(B)$ ($Z_R \rightarrow Spec(R)$ is finite hence affine), where $B$ is an $R$-algebra which as an $R$-module is locally free of rank $N$. Any element $f\in B$ acts by multiplication to define an $R$-linear endomorphism of $B$. Because $B$ is a locally free $R$-module of rank $N$, we can speak of the characteristic polynomial of this endomorphism $$\det(T-f)=T^N-\operatorname{Trace}(f)T^{N-1}+\ldots+(-1)^N\operatorname{Norm}(f)$$ which is a monic polynomial in $R[T]$ of degree $N$. (A justification for this last fact can be found on this related issue , for which any clarification is also welcome.) Now, here comes the definition. We say that a set of $N$ not necessarily distinct points $P_1,\ldots, P_N$ in $Z(S)$ is a full set of sections of $Z/S$ if for every affine $S$-scheme $\operatorname{Spec}(R)$, and for every function $f$ on $Z_R$ (ie $f \in B=H^0(Z_R,\mathcal{O})$), we have the equality of polynomials in $R[T]$ $$\det (T-f)=\prod _{i=1}^N(T-f(P_i))$$ All right, now my question may sound basic (and I apologize if it is), but I am unsure about how to make sense of $f(P_i)$. What does it mean? How can we apply an element of $B$ to a morphism $S\rightarrow Z$? My guess is that such a morphism becomes $\operatorname{Spec}(R)\rightarrow Z_R$ after base change (it is defined by the composite morphism $\operatorname{Spec}(R)\rightarrow S \rightarrow Z$, together with the identity $\operatorname{Spec}(R) \rightarrow \operatorname{Spec}(R)$). Then, it induces a map on global section $B\rightarrow R$, which may then be applied to $f$ to get an element of $R$. Is this construction what is really intended here? Moreover, if this is the case, wouldn't it make more sense to write $P_i(f)$ instead?
