There's the 'onion' proof, where we break up the circle into rings and integrate:  $$\int_0^{r_0 }2\pi r\, \d r=\pi r_0^2.$$ Of course, this proof is made rigorous using multivariate substitution from Cartesian to polar coordinates:  $$ \d x \d y =\begin{vmatrix}x_r & x_\theta\\ y_r& y_\theta\end{vmatrix}\,\d\theta\d r =r\,\d\theta \d r. $$ Now we integrate over $D=\left\{(x,y)\,\big|\,x^2+y^2\leq r_0^2\right\}$: $$ \iint_D\,\d x\d y =\int_0^{r_0}\int_0^{2\pi}r\, \d\theta\d r=\int_0^{r_0}2\pi r\, \d r. $$ This is the same integral as the first one. Note that when making the substitution, we used the derivatives of $\sin\theta$ and $\cos\theta$, both of which rely on the following well known limit:  $$\lim_{\theta\to 0}\frac{\sin\theta}{\theta}=1.$$ Instead of doing this, we can inscribe and circumscribe the circle with regular polygons.

81,Can a function have a strict local extremum at each point?,Can a function have a strict local extremum at each point?,,"A problem given in Spivak's Calculus text is to show that a function $f:[a,b]\to \mathbb{R}$ cannot have a strict local maximum at each point. I will sketch the proof below the fold. My question is: can a function $f:[a,b]\to \mathbb{R}$ have a strict local extremum at each point, perhaps a combination of strict local minima and maxima? If there did exist such a function, the sets $\{x: x\text{ a strict local maximum}\}$ and $\{x: x\text{ a strict local minimum}\}$ must both be dense, since if not, once we get our hands on an interval which contains only one type of extremum, the proof goes forward as before. Addendum: Such a function, if it were to exist, could not be continuous on any nonempty open set, because I claim a continuous function with a local (non-strict) extremum at each point must be a constant, which is a contradiction, because a constant function has no strict extrema. Proof that $f:[a,b]$ cannot have a strict local max at each point : Suppose $f$ is such a function. take any point $x_1$ in $[a,b]$ and surround it with an interval $[a_1,b_1]$ such that $0<b_1-a_1< \frac12 (b-a)$ such that $f(x)<f(x_1)$ for all $x\in [a_1,b_1]$. Now take any point in $[a_1,b_1]$ and get an interval $[a_2,b_2]$, again reducing the length by at least half, and so on.
