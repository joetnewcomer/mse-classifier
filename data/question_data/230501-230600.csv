0,Show that $\{x\}^A \approx A$,Show that,\{x\}^A \approx A,"I need to prove that $\{x\}^A \approx A$ , that is, that the set of all functions from a set with a single element (namely, x) to another set A is equipotent to the set A. Now the reasoning behind why this is true is clear: say A had only one element $y_0$ , then the only function from $\{x\}$ to A is the function $f(x) = y_0$ . Any other function would either not be a function (because $x$ would equal two different $f(x)$ ) or not belong in $\{x\}^A$ (because it wouldn't land in A).  If A has two elements $y_0$ and $y_1$ , then the only distinct functions from $\{x\}$ to A are $f(x) = y_0$ and $f(x) = y_1$ . Clearly both sets always have the same cardinality, as the constant functions are always in $\{x\}^A$ . My problem is I don't know how to write this as a formal proof. Previously I proved two sets were equipotent by finding a bijective function between them. But since in this case one of the sets is a set of functions, I don't know how to define a function whose parameter is another arbitrary function. I also thought to do it by induction (suppose cardinality of A to be n and prove it works for n+1) but I don't feel its the right way. I also thought to do it by transitivity of equipotence, but since A can be any set, I'm not sure how to formulate this.

By my understanding $\forall v_0(v_0 \in a \cup b \iff (v_0 \in a \vee v_0 \in b))$ is not a first order formula in the language of ZF because it contains $\cup$ which is not a symbol in the language of ZF.

6,"Every subset of a countable set is countable, proven by contradiction","Every subset of a countable set is countable, proven by contradiction",,"Kolmogorov & Fomin show that every subset of a countable set is countable by taking a set $A$ with elements $a_{1}, a_{2}, ...$ , and a subset of $A$ called $B$ with elements $a_{n_1}, a_{n_2}, ...$ , then arguing that if the $n_i$ have a largest element B is a finite set, otherwise B is countable with the correspondence $i \iff a_{n_i}$ . This is pretty much the only way I've seen this theorem proved anywhere, and while I appreciate how concise this approach is, for me it's much more intuitive to think of this in terms of the contradiction: Theorem: Every subset of a countable set is countable. Proof. First, we prove a lemma: Lemma : Let $f:A\rightarrow B$ be a bijection, $C \subseteq A$ , and $f\vert_{C}:C\rightarrow B$ the restriction of $f$ to $C$ . Then $f\vert_{C}$ is a bijection. Proof: Since $f$ is a bijection, $b = f(c)$ is uniquely defined for each $c \in C$ , $b \in B$ . Hence $f\vert_{C}$ , is a bijection, and the lemma is proved. Now let $A$ be a countable set, with $B$ a subset of $A$ . Let's suppose that $B$ is not countable. In other words we suppose that there does not exist a bijection between $B$ and some subset of the natural numbers. Since A is countable, there is a bijection $\phi:A\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$ . Because $\phi$ is a bijection, it is defined for each element of $A$ including those in $B$ , hence the restriction $\phi\vert_{B}:B\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$ must exist. Note that $\phi\vert_{B}$ is also bijective by our lemma. But this is impossible, since by hypothesis $B$ is not countable, so no such bijection can exist. Then we have reached a contradiction, and must assume otherwise -- namely, $B$ must be countable. Since $B$ was arbitrarily chosen, we can assume this holds in general for all subsets of countable sets. $\square$ My questions are the following: Is this proof sound? Given the length of my proof, I can see the appeal of the K&F style proof over this (assuming mine is sound). Are there places where mine could be made more concise? For example, I considered that the lemma might not be necessary since it (seems to) follow directly from the definition","Kolmogorov & Fomin show that every subset of a countable set is countable by taking a set with elements , and a subset of called with elements , then arguing that if the have a largest element B is a finite set, otherwise B is countable with the correspondence .

Let $\eta= \max\{\alpha, \beta\}+ \omega.$ Then $\eta < \kappa$ and $(\alpha,\beta)<_{cw} (0, \eta).$ HENCE, $h: \mu \to \eta \times \eta$ is injective.","I don't understand the proof to the a/m claim. How we know that $\eta < \kappa$ and $(\alpha,\beta)<_{cw} (0, \eta) $ and hence $h: \mu \to \eta \times \eta$ is injective? Appreciate if anyone could advise. Here is an excerpt of the proof: For an infinite ordinal $\kappa,$ the canonical well-ordering of $\kappa \times \kappa,$ denoted by $<_{cw}$ is defined as follows: $(\alpha_1, \beta_1)<_{cw} < (\alpha_2, \beta_2)$ iff either one of the following holds. $(1): \max\{\alpha_1,\beta_1\} < \max\{\alpha_2,\beta_2\}$ $(2): \max\{\alpha_1,\beta_1\} =\max\{\alpha_2,\beta_2\}$ and $\alpha_1<\alpha_2$ $(3): \max\{\alpha_1,\beta_1\} =\max\{\alpha_2,\beta_2\}$ and $\alpha_1 = \alpha_2$ and $\beta_1 < \beta_2.$ Claim: For all infinite cardinals $\kappa, (\kappa \times \kappa, <_{cw}) \cong (\kappa, \in).$ Proof: (It has been show that it is true for $\kappa = \omega$) Assume there is a counterexample  $\kappa.$ Let $A= \{\lambda \in \kappa + 1| \lambda\geq \omega \ is \ a \ cardinal \ and \ (\lambda \times \lambda, <_{cw}) \not\cong (\lambda, \in)\}.$ Then, $\kappa \in A.$ Let $\mu$ be least element of $A.$ Thus, $\mu > \omega$ and for all $\lambda,$ if $\omega \leq \lambda < \mu$ and $\lambda$ is a cardinal, then $(\lambda \times \lambda, <_{cw}) \cong (\lambda, \in).$ By Comparability theorem, $(\mu, \in)$ is isomorphic to initial segment of $(\mu \times \mu, <_{cw})$ since $|\mu \times \mu| \geq \mu$ and $\mu$ is cardinal. Let $(\alpha, \beta) \in \mu \times \mu$ such that $(\mu, \in)$ is isomorphic to initial segment of $(\mu \times \mu, <_{cw})$ given by $(\alpha, \beta).$ Let $h$ be the isomorphism. Let $\eta= \max\{\alpha, \beta\}+ \omega.$ Then $\eta < \kappa$ and $(\alpha,\beta)<_{cw} (0, \eta).$ HENCE, $h: \mu \to \eta \times \eta$ is injective.",,"['elementary-set-theory', 'proof-writing', 'cardinals', 'ordinals']"
