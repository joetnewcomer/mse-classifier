1,Decreasing term assurance - find the interest rate,Decreasing term assurance - find the interest rate,,"A formula for decreasing term assurance is: $$  V_0 = V_k \times \left(\frac{1-(1+r)^{-n}}{1-(1+r)^{-(n-k)}}\right) $$ where $r$ is the annual rate of interest, $V_0$ is the sum assured at time $t=0$ and $V_k$ is the sum assured at time $t=k$.  The formula is normally used to obtain the original sum assured (ie $V_0)$ when the sum assured $V_k$ at time $t=k$ is known and when $r$ is known. However, if $V_0, V_k, n, k$ are all known, is it possible to determine the annual rate of interest $r$? As $0< r <1$ initially I thought I could use the negative binomial theorem to rearrange the original expression: $$ (1 + r)^{-n} = 1 - nr + \frac{1}{2}n(n+1)r^2 - \frac{1}{6}n(n+1)(n+2)r^3 + $$ If I let $L = \frac{V_0}{V_k}$ and if I let $m = n-k$, then the original expression is: \begin{eqnarray*}  L &=& \frac{1-(1+r)^{-n}}{1-(1+r)^{-m}} \iff L - L(1+r)^{-m} &=& 1-(1+r)^{-n} \end{eqnarray*} After substituting in expressions for $(1+r)^{-n}$ and $(1+r)^{-m}$ and then some simple tidying up I obtain the expression: $$ L\left(mr - \frac{1}{2}m(m+1)r^2 + \cdots \right) = \left(nr - \frac{1}{2}n(n+1)r^2 + \cdots\right) $$ or equivalently $$ \left(nr - \frac{1}{2}n(n+1)r^2 + \cdots\right) - L\left(mr - \frac{1}{2}m(m+1)r^2 + \cdots \right) = 0 $$ By grouping terms in the same power of $r$: $$ r(n-Lm) - \frac{1}{2}r^2\Big(n(n+1) -Lm(m+1)\Big) + \frac{1}{6}r^3\Big( n(n+1)(n+2) - Lm(m+1)(m+2)\Big) - \cdots = 0 $$ As $r>0$, dividing through by $r$ yields $$ (n-Lm) - \frac{1}{2}r\Big(n(n+1) -Lm(m+1)\Big)  + \frac{1}{6}r^2\Big( n(n+1)(n+2) - Lm(m+1)(m+2)\Big) -\cdots = 0 $$ I thought as an approximate answer I could ignore powers higher than $r^2$ and simply consider the above as a quadratic in $r$.  However, this doesn't yield a real value fot $r$ as the discriminant is less than $0$. My questions are: Have I made a mistake in the above, or is the method a dead-end? Is there an alternative mathematical technique that yields better results? Obviously $r$ can be obtained by trial and error when dealing with a few cases.

65,In which sense is the Fourier transform the continuous analogue of the discrete Fourier transform? A mathematical point of view.,In which sense is the Fourier transform the continuous analogue of the discrete Fourier transform? A mathematical point of view.,,"I try to understand in which sense the Fourier transform is the continuous analogue of the discrete Fourier transform . I know, there are many books and many questions on this site concerning this topic, but almost all of them are written from an engineer's point of view. I'm a mathematician, and as such, I'm not familiar with the application of Fourier analysis in engineering. So, I would like to handle the following objects as mathematical objects without any physical interpretation. Let me first introduce the relevant objects: Let $n\in\mathbb N$ and $\omega\in\mathbb C$ be a primitive $n$-th root of unity. It's easy to verify that the columns of $$\tilde V_\omega:=\frac 1{\sqrt n}\underbrace{\begin{pmatrix} \omega^{0\cdot 0}&\cdots&\omega^{0\cdot (n-1)}\\\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\\omega^{(n-1)\cdot 0}&\cdots&\omega^{(n-1)\cdot (n-1)} \end{pmatrix}}_{=:V_\omega}$$ are an orthonormal basis of $\mathbb C^n$. Now, $$\operatorname{DFT}_\omega:\mathbb C^n\to\mathbb C^n\;,\;\;\;z\mapsto\left(f_z\left(\omega^0\right),\ldots,f_z\left(\omega^{n-1}\right)\right)^T$$ with $$f_z(w):=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}z_kw^k\;\;\;\text{for }z=\left(z_0,\ldots,z_{n-1}\right)^T\text{ and }w\in\mathbb C$$ is called discrete Fourier transform . Again, it's easy to verify that $V_\omega$ is the transformation matrix of $\operatorname{DFT}_\omega$, i.e. $$\operatorname{DFT}_\omega z=V_\omega z\color{blue}{\stackrel{\text{def}}=\sqrt n\tilde V_\omega z}\;\;\;\text{for all }z\in\mathbb C^n\;,$$ and is invertible with $$V_\omega^{-1}=\frac 1nV_{\omega^{-1}}$$ and hence $\operatorname{DFT}_\omega$ is an isomorphism.

I would like to conclude that the discrete Fourier transform is an isomorphic isometry $(\mathbb C^n,\langle\;\cdot\;,\;\cdot\;\rangle)\to(\mathbb C^n,n\langle\;\cdot\;,\;\cdot\;\rangle)$ and that an analogue statement holds true for the Fourier transform on $(L^2(D;\mathbb C),\langle\;\cdot\;,\;\cdot\;\rangle_{L^2(D;\mathbb C)})$. Please keep this in mind, when you formulate an answer. I suppose $\mathcal F$ is not the mapping I'm looking for, cause its nature seems to be different $\operatorname{DFT}_\omega$. I guess the mapping should be $(L^2(D;\mathbb C)\to (L^2(D;\mathbb C)$ where the image is equipped with an inner product of the form $c\langle\;\cdot\;,\;\cdot\;\rangle_{L^2(D;\mathbb C)}$ for some $c\in\mathbb C$.","I try to understand in which sense the Fourier transform is the continuous analogue of the discrete Fourier transform . I know, there are many books and many questions on this site concerning this topic, but almost all of them are written from an engineer's point of view. I'm a mathematician, and as such, I'm not familiar with the application of Fourier analysis in engineering. So, I would like to handle the following objects as mathematical objects without any physical interpretation. Let me first introduce the relevant objects: Let $n\in\mathbb N$ and $\omega\in\mathbb C$ be a primitive $n$-th root of unity. It's easy to verify that the columns of $$\tilde V_\omega:=\frac 1{\sqrt n}\underbrace{\begin{pmatrix} \omega^{0\cdot 0}&\cdots&\omega^{0\cdot (n-1)}\\\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\\omega^{(n-1)\cdot 0}&\cdots&\omega^{(n-1)\cdot (n-1)} \end{pmatrix}}_{=:V_\omega}$$ are an orthonormal basis of $\mathbb C^n$. Now, $$\operatorname{DFT}_\omega:\mathbb C^n\to\mathbb C^n\;,\;\;\;z\mapsto\left(f_z\left(\omega^0\right),\ldots,f_z\left(\omega^{n-1}\right)\right)^T$$ with $$f_z(w):=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}z_kw^k\;\;\;\text{for }z=\left(z_0,\ldots,z_{n-1}\right)^T\text{ and }w\in\mathbb C$$ is called discrete Fourier transform . Again, it's easy to verify that $V_\omega$ is the transformation matrix of $\operatorname{DFT}_\omega$, i.e. $$\operatorname{DFT}_\omega z=V_\omega z\color{blue}{\stackrel{\text{def}}=\sqrt n\tilde V_\omega z}\;\;\;\text{for all }z\in\mathbb C^n\;,$$ and is invertible with $$V_\omega^{-1}=\frac 1nV_{\omega^{-1}}$$ and hence $\operatorname{DFT}_\omega$ is an isomorphism. We can easily prove that $$\langle\operatorname{DFT}_\omega z,\operatorname{DFT}_\omega w\rangle=n\langle z,w\rangle\;\;\;\text{for all }z,w\in\mathbb C^n$$ (using that $\tilde V_\omega$ is unitary). Now, let $a,b\in\mathbb R$ with $a<b$ and $D:=(a,b)$. It's a well-known fact that $$\phi_k(x):=\frac 1{\sqrt{b-a}}e^{2\pi{\rm i}\frac k{b-a}x}\;\;\;\text{for }k\in\mathbb Z\text{ and }x\in D$$ is an orthonormal basis of $L^2(D;\mathbb C)$ and hence $$u=\sum_{k\in\mathbb Z}\underbrace{\langle u,\phi_k\rangle_{L^2(D;\mathbb C)}}_{=:u_k}\phi_k\;\;\;\text{for all }u\in L^2(D;\mathbb C)\;.$$ Now, $$\sqrt{b-a}\sum_{k\in\mathbb Z}\tilde u_k\phi_k$$ with $$\tilde u_k:=\frac 1{\sqrt{b-a}}u_k\;\;\;\text{for }k\in\mathbb Z$$ is called Fourier series of $u\in L^2(D;\mathbb C)$. Let $$\mathcal F:L^2(D;\mathbb C)\to L^2(\mathbb Z;\mathbb C)\;,\;\;\;u\mapsto(\tilde u_k)_{k\in\mathbb Z}\;.$$ We can show that $$\langle\mathcal Fu,\mathcal Fv\rangle_{L^2(D;\mathbb C)}=(b-a)\langle(\tilde u_k)_{k\in\mathbb Z},(\tilde v_k)_{k\in\mathbb Z}\rangle_{L^2(\mathbb Z;\mathbb C)}\;\;\;\text{for all }u,v\in L^2(D;\mathbb C)\;.$$ Is $\mathcal F$ what we call the Fourier transform ?

82,Discrete systems with complicated basin boundaries?,Discrete systems with complicated basin boundaries?,,"I am trying to come up with the strategy to write my Master's thesis in mathematics. At the moment it is as follows: Finding a (preferably) discrete dynamical system that possesses at least 3 distinct attractors. Taking many different initial conditions (a grid of them, in 2D case) and coloring them according to the attractor that the system eventually converges to. Looking at the boundary of these basins of attraction in terms of fractal dimension , Wada property , etc. I noticed that the generalized Newton's method $$ z_{n+1}=z_n- a \frac{p(z_n)}{p'(z_n)} $$ gives somewhat interesting results even for a relatively straighforward polynomial $p(z) = z^3-1$. Below you can see basins of attraction for a few different $a \in \mathbb{C}$ values. However I received criticism that the model is maybe too simple.  The discussion shifted to suggestions to look at some other systems namely Henon-Hailes system (which is not discrete at all) and forced Duffing oscillator (which also has to be integrated numerically). I am not satisfied with these suggestions. Do you know any dynamical systems that could provide a rich variety of basin boundaries?
