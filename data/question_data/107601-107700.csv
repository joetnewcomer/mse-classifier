For instance, say we have the two points $(3, -2, 4)$ and $(-5, 7, 1)$. The vector equation of a line is $x = tw + v$, where $w$ and $v$ are vectors, $t$ is a real number, and $x$ is some point on the line. There are two commonly asked questions: Find the endpoint of the vector emanating from the origin and having the same length and direction as the vector beginning at $A$ and terminating at $B$. Find the equations of the lines through the following pairs of points in space. My understanding is that, in the case of 1, the order that you manipulate the vectors in matters, since the direction matters (we want a vector in a certain direction - not a line). However, in the case of 2, the order that you manipulate the vectors in does not matter, since a line has no direction. Is this understanding correct? Returning to the example above, let's assume that we are trying to find the equations of the lines through the pairs of points in space. In this case, there are 4 equivalently correct solutions for the line: $(-5, 7, 1) - (3, -2, 4) = (-8, 9, -3)$ or $(3, -2, 4) - (-5, 7, 1) = (8, -9, 3)$ $x = tw + v$ $x = t(-8, 9, -3) + (-5, 7, 1)$ $x = t(-8, 9, -3) + (3, -2, 4)$ $x = t(8, -9, 3) + (-5, 7, 1)$ $x = t(8, -9, 3) + (3, -2, 4)$ Would it be correct to say that, since these are lines (direction does not matter), all 4 are equivalent? I would greatly appreciate it if the members of MSE could please take the time to review my reasoning.

3,Any employment for the Varignon parallelogram?,Any employment for the Varignon parallelogram?,,"The midpoints of the sides of an arbitrary quadrilateral form a parallelogram, which is called the Varignon parallelogram of the quad.

5,Radius of a cyclic quadrilateral given diagonals,Radius of a cyclic quadrilateral given diagonals,,"I noticed something curious about intersecting chords in a circle.

The radius of the circle turns out magically to be the root-mean-square $$R=\sqrt{\frac{a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2}{4}}$$ I think it's fascinating, because for other pairs of intersecting chords, the radius is just as much an ""average"" as excenters of triangles are ""centers.""

See page 3 : The Pythagorean theorem was the first hint of a hidden, deeper relationship between arithmetic and geometry, and it has continued to hold a key position between these two realms throughout the history of mathematics. This has sometimes been a position of cooperation and sometimes one of conflict, as followed the discovery that is irrational. It is often the case that new ideas emerge from such areas of tension, resolving the conflict and allowing previously irreconcilable ideas to interact fruitfully. The tension between arithmetic and geometry [emphasis added] is, without doubt, the most profound in mathematics, and it has led to the most profound theorems.",a^2+b^2 = c^2  \sqrt{2} a=b=1 \sqrt 2,"['geometry', 'math-history']"
