0,Evaluating the sum $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\dfrac{(-1)^{n}}{n^{2}}$,Evaluating the sum,\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\dfrac{(-1)^{n}}{n^{2}},I am tasked to evaluate the sum  $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\dfrac{(-1)^{n}}{n^{2}}$$ Using contour integration. This is what I've done so far. Let $C_{N}$ be the square defined by the lines $x=\pm(N+\tfrac{1}{2})\pi$ and $y=\pm(N+\tfrac{1}{2})\pi$. Let $f=\tfrac{1}{z^{2}\sin(z)}$. I was able to prove that  $$\int_{C_{N}}\dfrac{1}{z^{2}\sin(z)}dz=2\pi i\left[\dfrac{1}{6}+2\sum_{n=1}^{N}\dfrac{(-1)^{n}}{\pi^{2}n^{2}} \right]. $$ By Cauchy's residue theorem. So now if I could prove that he integral converges to zero then I would be done. The problem is that I can't seem to get an upper bound on the integral. I've having trouble with the fact that $|f|$ is unbounded within $C_{N}$ so ML inequality doesn't help me. Any hints would be great.

My exposure to complex analysis is pretty much limited to the material in three books: Ahlfors, Bak/Newman, and Churchill/Brown. I don't care much for Churchill/Brown, but really enjoy the other two.

They both then show the Cauchy formula representing the function as a contour integral on a circle. After that, things begin to diverge. Bak/Newman develops the power series representation for analytic functions, and uses this to show analytic functions are infinitely differentiable. From this he gets Morera's theorem, the Uniqueness theorem, etc. Ahlfors instead proceeds to differentiate the Cauchy formula under the integral to show an analytic function is infinitely differentiable, to get Morera's theorem, the Uniqueness theorem, etc., without really mentioning power series. He leaves power series to (slightly) later development. (One thing I like about Ahlfors' approach is that, as far as I can tell, you can derive the differentiability of power series inside their radius of convergence without using the same kind of $\delta - \epsilon$ arguments that Bak/Newman uses.)

He thinks that while it's all good and well to learn the analytical side of math, he stresses more on the theory, than the application. Thus he gave us these questions that we must answer without a single equation. It's new and I sure enjoy the concept, but I'm not sure if I got it right. Could someone check my answers for me? Thanks! 1. Why there are n solutions to the $n$th root of a complex number? Because if the solution is some number w to the power of n (a series of natural numbers) then for each value of w there is one and only one solution value. 2. If a complex function is analytic, the function needs to satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equation. Outline the proof process of the necessary part of this argument. If a complex function is to be considered analytic, it must have a derivative at all points in its domain. Thus, if we assume a function has a derivative, then, according to the fundamental theorem of calculus, it can be expressed in terms of a limit. We can then divide the limit into real and imaginary components, since it is on a complex plane. And since the derivative exists, the limit also exists. This means that we can take the limit in any direction. If we approach it in a horizontal direction and in a vertical direction, we get two different equations for the derivative of the function. And since they are the meant to be equal, if we equate the real and imaginary terms of both equations, we get the two Cauchy-Riemann equations, thus showing that for a function to be analytic, it must satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations. This is the necessary condition for a function to be considered analytic. 3. Outline the proof process of the sufficient part of the argument in problem 2. The sufficient part of the argument outlined in problem 13-2 is that the partial derivative of the real part u of the function with respect to x is equal to the partial derivative of the imaginary part v of the function with respect to y. Additionally, the partial derivative of u with respect to y should be equal to the negative partial derivative of v with respect to x. Also, all partial derivatives of the function must be continuous. If we supply these substitutions in the Taylor series representation of the function and rearrange, then we can get the fundamental calculus definition of the derivative of the function with respect to a path z. If we substituted so that all partial derivatives are in respect of x, then we get the derivative of the function in the x-direction. The opposite is true if we substituted so that all partial derivatives are in respect of y. And since all the partial derivatives are continuous, the derivative of the function in both cases must exist. Thus, the function is differentiable, thus proving it’s analytic quality. Note that although the Cauchy-Riemann equations are satisfied, it is not compulsory that the function is analytic until the partial derivatives are continuous. 4. Describe the overall procedure of defining various complex functions: exponential, trigonometric, hyperbolic, logarithm, and general power. Discuss differences and similarities of the complex functions compared to real functions. From what I can observe, the general method of defining a complex function is to replace the x in the function’s real counterpart with a complex number. This method, armed with Euler’s equation, it becomes a simple matter or algebraic manipulation to get the complex functions. The complex exponential function is very similar to the real exponential function in that its derivative is itself and is even equal to the real function if the complex number has no imaginary part. Complex trigonometric functions, along with the hyperbolic functions, are also similar in that if the complex number has no imaginary part, the complex counterparts work exactly the same. Also, the complex trigonometric functions and the hyperbolic functions are entire, have the same derivative as their real counterparts and even hold the same general formulas as the real counterparts. However, the complex logarithmic and general power functions vary from their real counterparts. This is due to the fact that a complex exponential function has an infinite number of solutions, not allowing us to define a complex logarithmic function as we would a real logarithmic function. Thus, complex logarithmic functions differ in that while positive real values yield the same results, negative numbers do not. The same concept applies to complex general power functions (except that in this case the complex logarithmic function has infinitely many solutions) and thus some exponential laws cannot be carried out with complex power functions.","My Engineering Mathematics teacher have a very novel method of teaching.

Problem: Suppose $f$ is an entire function such that $f(0) = 1$ and $\int_0^{2\pi} |f(e^{i\theta})| d\theta = 2\pi$ . Show that $f$ must be a constant function. Original Attempt: Since $f(z)$ is entire, consider Cauchy's Integral Formula $$ f(a) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_\gamma \frac{f(z)}{z-a} dz $$ for $a=0$ and with $\gamma$ as the unit circle, which yields $$ f(0) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_\gamma \frac{f(z)}{z} dz = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{f(e^{i\theta})}{e^{i\theta}}\cdot ie^{i\theta} d\theta = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} f(e^{i\theta}) d\theta = 1. $$ Thus, we have $$ \int_0^{2\pi} f(e^{i\theta}) d\theta = 2\pi \quad \implies \quad \left\vert \int_0^{2\pi} f(e^{i\theta}) d\theta \right\vert = |2\pi| = 2\pi.  $$ Now, by the ML inequality (or estimation lemma), we also have that on the unit circle $$ \left\vert \int_0^{2\pi} f(e^{i\theta}) d\theta \right\vert \leq \max_{|z|=1} \left\vert f(e^{i\theta}) \right\vert \cdot 2\pi. $$ Since we already know that we actually have equality here, it must be that $$ \max_{|z|=1} \left\vert f(e^{i\theta}) \right\vert = 1. $$ But by the Maximum Modulus Principle, if $f(z)$ attains its maximum inside of the region $\gamma$ , which we have at $f(0)=1$ , then the function must be constant. CURRENT ATTEMPT: Since $f(z)$ is entire, consider Cauchy's Integral Formula $$ f(a) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_\gamma \frac{f(z)}{z-a} dz $$ for $a=0$ and with $\gamma$ as the unit circle, which yields $$ f(0) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_\gamma \frac{f(z)}{z} dz = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{f(e^{i\theta})}{e^{i\theta}}\cdot ie^{i\theta} d\theta = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} f(e^{i\theta}) d\theta = 1. $$ Thus, we have $$ \int_0^{2\pi} f(e^{i\theta}) d\theta = 2\pi.  $$ and from the problem statement, $$ \int_0^{2\pi} |f(e^{i\theta})| d\theta = 2\pi. $$ Subtracting yields $$ \int_0^{2\pi} \Big(|f(e^{i\theta})| - f(e^{i\theta})\Big) = 0 \quad \implies \quad |f(e^{i\theta})| = f(e^{i\theta}) $$ on the unit circle.

50,How can we mechanically rotate a branch-cut of a complex function?,How can we mechanically rotate a branch-cut of a complex function?,,"I'm looking for an algorithmic and mechanical way to define the branch cuts of an arbitrary (or not-so arbitrary, depending on how doable this is) complex function.  Given a function $f(z)$ that has a branch cut along, say, $[1,\infty)$ along the real line, is there a way to algebraically generate a function whose branch cut runs along $1+ci$ (for $c>0$ ), for instance?  The purpose of this question is to be able to plot arbitrary complex functions with arbitrary choices of branch cut in a computer algebra system like Mathematica , but I believe that this is a math question.  Implementing the answer in Mathematica would be straight-forward once I know how to do this. As a simple example, can we algebraically transform the function $$ \sqrt{z^2+1} = \sqrt{|z^2+1|}\exp\left(\frac{1}{2} \operatorname{Arg}({z^2+1}) \right), $$ which has branch cuts that are rays from $\pm i$ going vertically to infinity, to one that has branch cuts that are rays from $\pm i$ going horizontally to infinity.  I think if I can figure this one out, I'll have what I need. By way of expaning on my ideas, let's consider the following two situations. Branch cuts of $f(z) = \sqrt{z^2+1}$ via a Möbius transformation Two standard ways to define the branch cut of this function are to take the finite segment $[-i,i]$ (defined as the straight-line segment joining $-i$ and $i$ ) or to take the rays $[i,i\infty)$ and $(-i\infty,-i]$ (defined as the rays going vertically). If we define this function via the complex logarithm as $$ f(z) = \exp\left(\frac{1}{2}\log\left(z^2+1\right)\right), $$ and take the standard choice of brach cut for the logarithm, i.e., $$ \log(z) = \ln(|z|)+i \operatorname{Arg}(z), $$ where $-\pi\leq \operatorname{Arg}(z) < \pi$ , then this corresponds to the latter choice of  branch cuts ( $[i,\infty)$ and $(-\infty,-i]$ ). As explained in this answer , we can use a Möbius transformation $$ z\mapsto \frac{z+i}{z-i}, $$ under which the branch cuts are essentially transformed into each other, and define the function $$ g(z)=(z-i)\exp\left(\frac{1}{2}\log\left(\frac{z+i}{z-i}\right)\right), $$ which matches $f(z)$ for $\operatorname{Re}(z)>0$ .  We can verify this with Mathematica by plotting these functions (below). As far as I've been able to work out, this is the only Möbius transformation that works for this case, i.e., it's the only such transformation that makes $f$ and $g$ both be ""square roots"" of $z^2+1$ . Branch cuts of $\sqrt{z}$ implemented in Mathematica In Mathematica , $sqrt(z)$ is implemented with a branch cut along the negative real axis, consistent with the choice of branch cut for the logarithm mentioned above.  Indeed, defining a function f[z_] = Sqrt[Abs[z]] Exp[I*Arg[z]/2] yields the same results as Sqrt[z] , since Mathematica 's Arg function restricts its output to be between $-\pi$ and $\pi$ .  It is straight-forward to write our own function that rotates the branch cut, as seen here : sqrt[z_, s_] := Sqrt[Abs[z]] Exp[I/2 Arg[z Exp[-I (s + π)]] + s + π] This subtracts a phase from the argument $z$ , evaluates the Arg function, and then adds the phase back in. Here's an example where we rotate the branch cut by $\pi/4$ (plotting the real part of the function): Attempt at transforming $\sqrt{z^2+1}$ The same trick doesn't work here.  First of all, we can define this function via the square root function with the different branch cut in the following way.  Define the square root with a rotated branch cut rotated by $\sigma$ as $$ \operatorname{sqrt}(z) = \sqrt{|z|}\exp\left( \frac{i}{2}\left(\operatorname{Arg}(ze^{-i(\sigma+\pi)}) + \sigma + \pi\right) \right). $$ Then, we can just define $$ g(z) = \operatorname{sqrt}(z^2+1) $$ in order to change the branch cut.  Unfortunately, this doesn't rotate the branch cut but rather deforms it, as can be seen in the following plot of the real parts of $\sqrt{z^2+1}$ and $g(z)$ with $\sigma=3\pi/4$ (it starts off linear in the vicinity of the branch point, but then curves away): So instead, I tried to do something similar to what we did with the square root function directly.  Basically, since $$ \sqrt{z^2+1} = \sqrt{|z^2+1|}\exp\left(\frac{i}{2}\operatorname{Arg}(z^2+1)\right), $$ it seems like we should be able to redefine the argument directly in such a way that the branch cut becomes linear in some arbitrary direction by doing something like $$ \operatorname{Arg}(z^2+1) = \operatorname{Arg}\left(\left(ze^{-i(\sigma+\pi)}\right)^2+1\right) + (?), $$ but I cannot figure out what $\sigma$ should be.

Explain how the study of the equation $Xu+au = f$ can be (locally) reduced to the study of the equation $Xv=g$ . Here, Serge is using the notation $Xu \triangleq X\cdot\nabla u$ ; $u$ is a scalar function (presumably, due to $a$ , taking values in $\mathbb C$ ). I would assume $f,g$ can be taken to be smooth. Things I've tried: The ""(locally)"" that appears in the question suggests to me a change of variables. But if I say let tildes mean composition with some nice $\phi$ , e.g. $\tilde u=u\circ \phi$ and so on, all I end up with is $(\tilde X \cdot ((\nabla \phi)^{-1}\circ \phi)\nabla \tilde u) +  \tilde a \tilde u = \tilde f$ which doesn't seem helpful. I tried to consider the real and imaginary parts. (Earlier in the book, it is remarked that $\partial_t + i\partial_x$ is the Cauchy-Riemann operator; the real and imaginary parts of $\partial_tu + i\partial_xu =0$ form precisely the standard system called the Cauchy-Riemann equations) But I don't see any way to continue from the resulting system. If say $u=v+iw$ , $f=g+ih$ , and $a=b+ic$ , then the two equations you get for $(v,w)$ are $$ Xv+bv - cw = g, \\ Xw + cv + bw = h.$$ I tried to use what I know from basic ODE theory, namely integrating factors. If I could solve $Xz = az$ , with $z\neq 0$ everywhere, then by Leibniz rule, $$ X  (uz) = zXu + uX z = z Xu + au z $$ Then $$Xu + au = f\iff zXu + auz = fz \iff X(uz) = fz$$ Of course, one takes $uz=v$ and $fz=g$ , to match the question's notation, so this feels like the most promising approach. But I don't get what the complex part of $a$ is supposed to do for me, and the book did not consider solving things like $Xz = az$ yet, nor am I 100% sure its always possible to solve this equation. Are any of these a step in the right direction, and does anyone have some pointers? (edit after sleeping) So in the case where $X=\partial_1$ and $a$ takes purely imaginary values, it works out like this. You start the solution of $Xz=az$ at whatever $z_0$ say $z_0=1$ . The solution is $z(x) = z_0 \exp(\int_0^{x_1} a(s,x_2,\dots,x_n) ds)$ . My stronger assumption on $a$ means that $$\partial_1\left( \frac{|z|^2}2 \right) = \Re(\partial_1 z\overline z)= \Re ( a |z|^2) = 0$$ so that $|z|^2$ is a constant, and in particular $z\neq 0 $ everywhere.

Explain how the study of the equation can be (locally) reduced to the study of the equation . Here, Serge is using the notation ; is a scalar function (presumably, due to , taking values in ). I would assume can be taken to be smooth. Things I've tried: The ""(locally)"" that appears in the question suggests to me a change of variables. But if I say let tildes mean composition with some nice , e.g. and so on, all I end up with is which doesn't seem helpful. I tried to consider the real and imaginary parts. (Earlier in the book, it is remarked that is the Cauchy-Riemann operator; the real and imaginary parts of form precisely the standard system called the Cauchy-Riemann equations) But I don't see any way to continue from the resulting system. If say , , and , then the two equations you get for are I tried to use what I know from basic ODE theory, namely integrating factors. If I could solve , with everywhere, then by Leibniz rule, Then Of course, one takes and , to match the question's notation, so this feels like the most promising approach. But I don't get what the complex part of is supposed to do for me, and the book did not consider solving things like yet, nor am I 100% sure its always possible to solve this equation. Are any of these a step in the right direction, and does anyone have some pointers? (edit after sleeping) So in the case where and takes purely imaginary values, it works out like this.

Case 1:- When $a \ge 6+2\sqrt2$ In this case the radius of the circle represented by $|z-4\sqrt3|=a$ is greater than the distance between the centers of the circles, i.e $r_2\gt AB$ as $r_2\gt 8$.

So, $a\in(6+2\sqrt2,\infty)$ Case 2:- $0\le a\le 6-2\sqrt2$ In this case we see that due to the bounding of $a$, we see that $(r_1+r_2)\lt 8$, so there is no intersection of the wanted regions, so there is no solution in this region. So the required interval of $a$ is $\boxed{a \in [6+2\sqrt2, \infty)}$ Algebraic Solution (or whatever you wanna call it) :- Lets consider all the possible circles that can be drawn for the given circles, they are as given in the figure:- From the above drawn circles we can consider the following cases. Case 1:- From Figure-3 (I have not numbered it so consider it in the left to right manner) we can get the following condition $$AB\lt r_1+r_2 \implies 8 \lt \sqrt{a^2-12a+28} + a \implies a\gt 9$$ This case deals with the limiting condition of both the circles touching. Case 2:- Now to not let the Figure-5 take place we have to consider the case $$AB\gt r_1-r_2 \implies 8 \gt \sqrt{a^2-12a+28} -a \implies a\gt -\frac{9}{7}$$ Now, I don't know what to conclude from this, so please do tell me that Case 3:- Consider Figure-4(don't know why I drew the last figure as it IMO represents the same case as Figure 4), the case we get is  $$AB\lt r_2-r_1 \implies 8\lt a-\sqrt{a^2-12a+28} \implies a\gt 9$$ My deal with the question:- $a\gt 9$, $a\gt 9$ everywhere not a single $a\ge 6+2\sqrt2$ to see.(It's a joke) So as you can see that from the Algebraic solution I got $a\gt 9$ and from the Graphical approach to the question I get $a\ge 6+2\sqrt2$. And the book I am solving also gives the answer interval as $a\in (9,\infty)$. So what is wrong with the solutions and do point out the errors. As, always more elegant solutions are welcome.

So, the circle $|z-4\sqrt3|=a$ either encloses the circle $|z+4i|=\sqrt{a^2-12a+28}$(or the point $-4i$, which is the case when $a=6+2\sqrt2$) fully or encloses a portion of it and in both the cases we find that we obtain a number common to both the regions. So, $a\in(6+2\sqrt2,\infty)$ Case 2:- $0\le a\le 6-2\sqrt2$ In this case we see that due to the bounding of $a$, we see that $(r_1+r_2)\lt 8$, so there is no intersection of the wanted regions, so there is no solution in this region. So the required interval of $a$ is $\boxed{a \in [6+2\sqrt2, \infty)}$ Algebraic Solution (or whatever you wanna call it) :- Lets consider all the possible circles that can be drawn for the given circles, they are as given in the figure:- From the above drawn circles we can consider the following cases. Case 1:- From Figure-3 (I have not numbered it so consider it in the left to right manner) we can get the following condition $$AB\lt r_1+r_2 \implies 8 \lt \sqrt{a^2-12a+28} + a \implies a\gt 9$$ This case deals with the limiting condition of both the circles touching. Case 2:- Now to not let the Figure-5 take place we have to consider the case $$AB\gt r_1-r_2 \implies 8 \gt \sqrt{a^2-12a+28} -a \implies a\gt -\frac{9}{7}$$ Now, I don't know what to conclude from this, so please do tell me that Case 3:- Consider Figure-4(don't know why I drew the last figure as it IMO represents the same case as Figure 4), the case we get is  $$AB\lt r_2-r_1 \implies 8\lt a-\sqrt{a^2-12a+28} \implies a\gt 9$$ My deal with the question:- $a\gt 9$, $a\gt 9$ everywhere not a single $a\ge 6+2\sqrt2$ to see.(It's a joke) So as you can see that from the Algebraic solution I got $a\gt 9$ and from the Graphical approach to the question I get $a\ge 6+2\sqrt2$. And the book I am solving also gives the answer interval as $a\in (9,\infty)$. So what is wrong with the solutions and do point out the errors. As, always more elegant solutions are welcome. In my opinion the answer should be $a\in [6+2\sqrt2, \infty)$, which is evident from the graph figure below.",,"['complex-analysis', 'inequality', 'complex-numbers']"

92,Why can the zero set of a collection of holomorphic functions be written as the zero set of finitely many?,Why can the zero set of a collection of holomorphic functions be written as the zero set of finitely many?,,"I've been reading the first few sections of Griffiths and Harris, and they state without proof (about halfway down page 14 in my 1994 Wiley Classics Library edition) that the zero locus of an arbitrary collection of holomorphic functions in a polydisc is in fact given by a finite number of holomorphic functions in a smaller polydisc. I'd like to know how to prove this.

Indeed, if $\{f_\alpha\}$ are holomorphic functions on a polydisc $U$ about zero then there exist $g_1, \ldots, g_k \in \mathcal{O}_n$ with $(f_\alpha)=(g_i)$ and, shrinking $U$ if necessary, I get that the zero set of the $f_\alpha$ is contained in the zero set of the $g_i$, but I can't see how to prove the reverse inclusion.","I've been reading the first few sections of Griffiths and Harris, and they state without proof (about halfway down page 14 in my 1994 Wiley Classics Library edition) that the zero locus of an arbitrary collection of holomorphic functions in a polydisc is in fact given by a finite number of holomorphic functions in a smaller polydisc.
