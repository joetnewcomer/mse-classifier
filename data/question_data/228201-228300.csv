Then we can choose some set $A$ such that $A \in F$ and $A \in G$. Since $A \in F$, then $A \subset \cup F$ (this result is true and was proven by me before as an exercise, so I just use it here). Similarly, since $A \in G$, every element of $A$ is in $\cup G$. But then every element of $A$ is in both $\cup F$ and $\cup G$, and this is impossible since $\cup F$ and $\cup G$ are disjoint.

My question is, is this set $A^{*}$ countably or uncountably infinite? Does it matter how many letters there are in your alphabet?

Improve this question Given the discussions on Refuting the Anti-Cantor Cranks in which I left a comment that I suspected would not get any attention, I decided to start a new thread instead. Now, I can't read the mind of ""anti-Cantorians"" so I don't really know what their objections are. But I get the impression that most reasonable objections aren't based upon the validity of the proofs that $\mathbb{R}$ has higher cardinality than $\mathbb{N}$. That seems pretty undisputable. But a viewpoint I personally haven't been able to shake is the notion of cardinality as capable of describing ""sizes"" of sets. Now, different people may have different views on which criteria this notion of size absolutely needs to adhere to and which we can discard, but I think it's certainly thinkable to require that any reasonable notion of size needs to satisfy $B \subset A \Rightarrow \text{size}(B) < \text{size}(A).$ Starting from the assumption that $B \subset A \Rightarrow \text{size}(B) < \text{size}(A)$, then the statement ""if two sets can be put into one-to-one correspondence with each other, then they are of the same size"" leads to a contradiction and can therefore not be true, leading us to a chicken-and-egg axiom argument with no right answer.

Am I wrong in assuming all mathematical results relating to cardinalities of sets will be as relevant without thinking of it as a ""size""? What does the interpretation really buy us and what would we lose by leaving the notion of the size of an infinite set undefined?

We want a nice, intuitive notion of the ""size"" (or better yet, ""numerosity"") of a set. So we make a list of properties that we know hold for finite sets that ideally we would want to hold for infinite sets. Two of these: 1) If you can take all the elements of set $A$ and place each element next to a unique member of set $B$, then $A$ and $B$ are ""of the same size"". 2) If you take a set $A$ and proceed by removing some elements from it, then you will have a set smaller in size than you started out with. Taking the first one as an axiom leads to the concept of ""cardinality"", causing property 2 to lead to a contradiction, while taking the second one as an axiom leads to the first one causing a contradiction. Clearly we can't have both of them. From some answers and comments, you get the impression that expecting the second property to hold is a ""fallacy"", sprung through some naive expectation that properties of finite sets should automatically carry over to infinite sets. But it seems to me that the same could be said for the first property. The only reason to prefer using #1 as a definition seems to be ""more interesting mathematics spring from it"", which is clearly an excellent reason - but it doesn't make it a more natural candidate for capturing the notion of size than #2.

63,Improving my understanding of Cantor's Diagonal Argument,Improving my understanding of Cantor's Diagonal Argument,,"I studied Cantor's Diagonal Argument in school years ago and it's always bothered me (as I'm sure it does many others).  In my head I have two counter-arguments to Cantor's Diagonal Argument.  I'm not a mathy person, so obviously, these must have explanations that I have not yet grasped. My first issue is that Cantor's Diagonal Argument ( as wonderfully explained by Arturo Magidin ) can be viewed in a slightly different light, which appears to unveil a flaw in the argument.  If we assume that s_f is an image of f at some index n , then it does not make sense to define s_f as $s_f=(s_1,s_2,s_3,…,s_n,…)$  where $\begin{equation} s_k = \begin{cases}0 & \mathrm{if\ } f(n)_n = 1\\1 & \mathrm{if\ } f(n)_n = 0\end{cases}\end{equation}$ since then the $n$th element of $s_f$ would be defined as the opposite of itself .  Since Cantor's Diagonal Argument uses this definition that wouldn't make sense if s_f has an index, then s_f must not have an index, and from there it seems obvious that they would reach the conclusion that s_f is not an image of f .  Isn't that begging the question? My second issue is more complicated, and less articulate, but basically that when I attempt to put numbers into Cantor's Diagonal Argument, I could demonstrate that the ""missing"" element was the within a constant distance from the last element in the ""series"", which means all of the infinite other numbers must be before it, which means no matter how long you count, you'd never reach it.  For example, if one puts these in the most obvious order of ""counting"" 0000..., 1000..., 0100...., 1100..., 0010... then the element to be found is obviously the element where all $s_k = 1$, which would be the ""last"" element in that ordering.

The empty set $\{\}$ is a subset of every set because, if $A$ is an arbitrary set, then every element of $\{\}$ is also an element of $A$. This statement is said to be ""vacuously true"" because $\{\}$ has no elements. But what about statements that imply the negation of this? Namely: the empty set $\{\}$ is not a subset of any set because, if $A$ is an arbitrary set, then not every element of $\{\}$ is an element of $A$. Couldn't this statement be vacuously true because $\{\}$ has no elements? What about: the empty set $\{\}$ is not a subset of some sets because there exists a set $A$ with the property that not every element of $\{\}$ is an element of $A$. Couldn't this statement be vacuously true because $\{\}$ has no elements? I understand that the fact that the empty set is a subset of every set (by vacuous truth) is merely a convention (I might be wrong, and it might be a necessity , to avoid contradictions or something). Is it possible to develop a (contradiction-free) mathematical formalism where we adopt the opposite convention? If so, what are the consequences?","This question already has answers here : Is ""The empty set is a subset of any set"" a convention? (7 answers) Closed 6 years ago . $\hskip8pt$ Definition .

But we know $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable, so we show the same for $(a,b)$ and $[a,b]$? and how can I make use of the Cantor-Schroder-Bernstein Theorem?

I was reading about Cantor’s Diagonal Proof and learned about $\aleph_1$ and $\aleph_0$. Would it make sense for there to be an $\aleph_2$ by just using the same method that Cantor used but on $\aleph_1$?,Can there be an $\aleph_2$ or even greater?
