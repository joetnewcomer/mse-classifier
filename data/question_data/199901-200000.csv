How many different ways are there to embed $M$ isometrically in $N$? In this context, I say the embedding $i_1$ is different from $i_2$ if there is no isometry $\varphi:N\to N$ suct that $i_2=\varphi\circ i_1$. This question is rather easy for specific pairs of manifolds. For example, if $M$ is a line, any embedding has an arc length parametrization, which is just a different name for isometric embedding. Alternatively, let $M$ be Euclidean plane and $N$ Euclidean space. Then for every (smooth) function $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$, the submanifold $$\{(x,y,z)|y=f(x)\}\subset\mathbb{R}^3,$$equipped with the Riemannian metric inherited from $\mathbb{R}^3$, is isometric to the plane. It is not hard to convince oneself that many of these submanifolds cannot be carried to one another by isometries of Euclidean space. However, there are other simple examples for which I don't know the answer. For example, what happens when $M$ is $S^2$ with the unit sphere metric, and $N$ is Euclidean space? Somehow, the only way I can imagine $S^2$ embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is by the standard embedding, but I can't find an argument to prove that. Intuitively speaking, it may have something to do with curvature. If so, I guess the answer to the question changes when allowing $C^1$ embeddings. Anything regarding the last example, of the sphere and Euclidean space, would already make me happy. If, by any chance, someone has an answer to a more general case, that would be great.

This question is rather easy for specific pairs of manifolds. For example, if $M$ is a line, any embedding has an arc length parametrization, which is just a different name for isometric embedding. Alternatively, let $M$ be Euclidean plane and $N$ Euclidean space. Then for every (smooth) function $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$, the submanifold $$\{(x,y,z)|y=f(x)\}\subset\mathbb{R}^3,$$equipped with the Riemannian metric inherited from $\mathbb{R}^3$, is isometric to the plane. It is not hard to convince oneself that many of these submanifolds cannot be carried to one another by isometries of Euclidean space. However, there are other simple examples for which I don't know the answer. For example, what happens when $M$ is $S^2$ with the unit sphere metric, and $N$ is Euclidean space? Somehow, the only way I can imagine $S^2$ embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is by the standard embedding, but I can't find an argument to prove that. Intuitively speaking, it may have something to do with curvature. If so, I guess the answer to the question changes when allowing $C^1$ embeddings. Anything regarding the last example, of the sphere and Euclidean space, would already make me happy. If, by any chance, someone has an answer to a more general case, that would be great. Insights about less smooth embeddings (e.g. $C^1$ embeddings) are also welcome, though I'm mostly interested in the smooth case.",,"['differential-geometry', 'riemannian-geometry']"

By embedded submanifold I mean a topological manifold in the subspace topology equipped with a smooth structure such that the inclusion of the curve into $\Bbb{R}^2$ is a smooth embedding. I don't even know where to start please help me. All the usual tricks I know of removing a point from a curve and see what happens don't work. How can I extract out information about the cusp to conclude it is not? Also can I put a smooth structure on it so it is an immersed submanifold? THankz.,,[]

Assume that A does not have 1 as an eigenvalue. Show that the number of fixed points can be expressed in terms of the Trace of A only. Thoughts: The condition that $\Phi_A$ has a fixed point is equivalent to $A$ taking a point $(a,b)\in \mathbb{R}^2$ to $(a+m,b+n)$ where $m,n\in \mathbb{Z}$. Multiplying the matrix by a vector $(a,b)$ with entries $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta$ we obtain equations $(a,b)=(\alpha a + \beta b, \gamma a + \delta b)$. Those can only differ by the addition of an integer, so $\beta = \gamma = 0$ and then the only two elements of the matrix left are the eigenvalues - the terms which are found in the Trace. and if A takes something to ($\alpha a, \beta b$) then $\Phi_A$ must take it to $(a,b)$ since they differ by an integer.

I can verify that it holds at the places where the major axes intersect the surface. ( Mathworld has an equation for the Gaussian curvature, which simplifies at those points.) But verifying that it holds elsewhere seems like it would get ugly. The motivation for this question is that Lord Kelvin proved that the charge density on a conducting ellipsoid is proportional to the distance of the tangent plane from the center, while McAllister (I W McAllister 1990 J.

(The proportionality is definitely not universal. For a pair of conducting spheres that are far apart and connected by a wire, the exponent is not 1/4. For a deep concavity, all of this definitely fails -- you get a a Faraday cage, which excludes the electric field almost completely.)","Is it true that the Gaussian curvature of an ellipsoid is proportional to fourth power of the distance of the tangent plane from the center?

As can be seen in chapter 8 of this book, the mean curvature $H$ of a hypersurface $(M^{(n)},g)$ at $p\in M$ is defined as $H=\frac{1}{n}\mathsf{tr}(s)$ , where $s$ is the shape operator ( Weingarten map ) of $M$ at $p$ in the direction of a smooth unit normal vector field $N$ . Since $s$ is a self-adjoint operator on the tangent space $T_p M$ , linear algebra assures us that  there exists an orthonormal basis $\{E_1,\ldots,E_n\}$ for $T_p M$ consisting of eigenvectors of $s$ . This makes it relatively easy to diagonalize $s$ . If the eigenvalues corresponding to $E_1,\ldots,E_n$ are $\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_n$ respectively, then the representation of $s$ in $\{E_1,\ldots,E_n\}$ is simply $\mathsf{diag}(\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_n)$ , thereby leading to $$H=\frac{1}{n}(\lambda_1+\ldots+\lambda_n).$$ Now I'd like to know how to start from this expression to get $$H=\frac{1}{n}(\mathsf{tr}_g h)(p)$$ if $\mathsf{tr}_g h$ is the trace of the scalar second fundamental form $h$ with respect to $g$ .
