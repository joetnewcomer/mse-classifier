8,Closed form of distance travelled by each corner of a rectangle that is simultaneously rotated and translated,Closed form of distance travelled by each corner of a rectangle that is simultaneously rotated and translated,,"Motivation, Background, and Research I'm a programmer for an FRC robotics team. We use a holonomic drivetrain called Swerve, wherein each wheel is independently rotated and driven. During our journey through this season, we've come across several interesting math problems, mostly rooted in trigonometry. This is a question we've managed to sidestep so far, by changing the way we've approached some problems. However, I'm still curious about it, even if we never end up needing to know. Inverse kinematics and other information for the Swerve drivetrain can be found here . TL;DR: I might be overthinking this. I know there are formulas for setting wheel velocities and headings in the white paper (derivation for rectangular case here ) at the linked page. However, I can't tell if they produce the desired behavior exactly. It may be as simple as integrating the velocities over the necessary time, but I'm not sure. We use a combination of these formulas and path tracking that currently uses the robot's center position, calculated by averaging the recorded positions of each wheel module. We can calculate where we've been, but I'd like a closed-form solution for any translation and rotation. This would allow us to follow per-wheel paths more precisely. I'm taking Calculus II right now, and frankly I expect that the answer(s) will be over my head. That's fine with me—I'll just keep learning until I understand. I have done some searching about loci, arc length, parametric functions, and translations, but I haven't been able to find anything about this specific problem. Problem A note on the angles used in this question: For whatever reason, the angles used in Swerve kinematics are wonky from a math standpoint. They're similar to the headings on a compass, though: $0^\circ$ in normal math corresponds to $90^\circ$ in Swerve math, and vice versa. Positive angles are clockwise.

We want to translate the rectangle by a vector $V = \left<\Delta x,\Delta y\right>$ and rotate it by an angle $\Delta\alpha$ about its center. Both transformations take place over the same period of time and at constant rates. That is, if it takes 10 seconds to perform this motion, then at 5 seconds, the rectangle's center is halfway to its final destination, and its rotation is halfway between where it was and where it will be.

Based on this, I make the following definition: A map $f: X \to X$ is called a local self -isometry at $x \in X$ , or perhaps a local isometry anchored at $x \in X$ , if $x$ has a neighborhood $U_x$ such that (the restriction of) $f$ maps $U_x$ isometrically onto a (possibly different) neighborhood $V_x$ of $x$ , and if the map $f$ fixes $x$ , i.e. $f(x) = x$ . EDIT: We could also say "" pointed local isometries (autometries)"", mirroring the terminology used in Theorem 10.10.1 on p.398 of Burago, Burago, Ivanov (""pointed homeomorphism""). /EDIT If we don't require that $f$ fixes $x$ , then $f$ could map onto a neighborhood of $x$ in a way which (""morally"") is not ""centered/focused"" around $x$ (e.g. in Euclidean space a translation of $U_x$ to another neighborhood in which $x$ is closer or further from the boundary than before). (The condition doesn't seem necessary to make the set a group, however, see below. Thus its purpose should be understood solely as a heuristic to avoid and exclude local isometries in which the presence of $x$ in the domain and range/image isn't an ""afterthought"", like for translations.) Question: (a) Given a metric space $(X,d)$ and a point $x \in X$ , does the set of all local self -isometries at $x$ form a group (which one might call the local isometry group at $x$ )? (b) If the answer to (a) is affirmative, what is this group for any point in Euclidean space? (It has to be the same at each point because of homogeneity.) Is it just $O(n)$ ? Attempt: (a) Any isometry $f: X \to X$ is bijective, so has an inverse $f^{-1}: X \to X$ , which is also clearly an isometry, since $f$ is. $d(f^{-1}(x_1),f^{-1}(x_2)) = d(f^{-1}(f(y_1)), f^{-1}(f(y_2))) = d(y_1, y_2)$ , where $y_1$ and $y_2$ are the points such that $f(y_1) = x_1, f(y_2) = x_2$ , and since $f$ is an isometry, $d(x_1, x_2) = d(f(x_1),f(x_2)) = d(y_1, y_2) = d(f^{-1}(x_1), f^{-1}(x_2))$ , thus $f^{-1}$ is an isometry. Now assume that $f$ is a local self-isometry at $x$ . Then $f$ restricts to an isometry of $U_x$ onto $V_x$ , for $U_x$ and $V_x$ neighborhoods of $x$ . But that means that $f^{-1}$ restricts to an isometry of $V_x$ onto $U_x$ , so $f^{-1}$ is a local self-isometry at $x$ , so the set of all local self-isometries at $x$ is closed under inverses. (Since $f(x)=x$ implies that $f^{-1}(x) = f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$ .) The identity is obviously a local self-isometry at $x$ for any point $x \in X$ (because it maps any neighborhood $U_x$ of $x$ isometrically onto itself and fixes every point), and associativity follows from the associativity of function composition. So the set of local self-isometries at $x$ is a group. (b) According to this document, exercise 40 on p. 9 , every local isometry of Euclidean space extends to a global isometry. Therefore, it should be the case that any local self-isometry of Euclidean space extends to a global isometry which fixes $x$ .

Based on this, I make the following definition: A map is called a local self -isometry at , or perhaps a local isometry anchored at , if has a neighborhood such that (the restriction of) maps isometrically onto a (possibly different) neighborhood of , and if the map fixes , i.e. . EDIT: We could also say "" pointed local isometries (autometries)"", mirroring the terminology used in Theorem 10.10.1 on p.398 of Burago, Burago, Ivanov (""pointed homeomorphism""). /EDIT If we don't require that fixes , then could map onto a neighborhood of in a way which (""morally"") is not ""centered/focused"" around (e.g. in Euclidean space a translation of to another neighborhood in which is closer or further from the boundary than before). (The condition doesn't seem necessary to make the set a group, however, see below. Thus its purpose should be understood solely as a heuristic to avoid and exclude local isometries in which the presence of in the domain and range/image isn't an ""afterthought"", like for translations.) Question: (a) Given a metric space and a point , does the set of all local self -isometries at form a group (which one might call the local isometry group at )? (b) If the answer to (a) is affirmative, what is this group for any point in Euclidean space? (It has to be the same at each point because of homogeneity.) Is it just ? Attempt: (a) Any isometry is bijective, so has an inverse , which is also clearly an isometry, since is. , where and are the points such that , and since is an isometry, , thus is an isometry. Now assume that is a local self-isometry at . Then restricts to an isometry of onto , for and neighborhoods of . But that means that restricts to an isometry of onto , so is a local self-isometry at , so the set of all local self-isometries at is closed under inverses. (Since implies that .) The identity is obviously a local self-isometry at for any point (because it maps any neighborhood of isometrically onto itself and fixes every point), and associativity follows from the associativity of function composition. So the set of local self-isometries at is a group. (b) According to this document, exercise 40 on p. 9 , every local isometry of Euclidean space extends to a global isometry.

My goal is this: given only the ratio between any two (straight) named lengths in the diagram, or between any one length and the radius of the relevant circle (the length given as ""1"" in the diagram), construct the entire triangle with straightedge and compass. So far, I've proven the cases with radius and any other length; with any two of sine, versine or chord; with sine and cosine; with sine and tangent; with secant and tangent; with secant and exsecant, and with secant and cosecant. The co-forms are analogous and trivial to prove from these. I have also discovered that given tangent and cotangent I can use a guess-and-adjust construction to find the height necessary to make cot+tan a hypotenuse, and thus the radius, but I can't find a strict straightedge-and-compass construction. I am also aware that it may well be impossible to use certain pairs to construct the whole triangle of measures, but my disproving abilities are far behind my proving abilities. Any proofs or disproofs would be appreciated. Edit I: Thanks to Aretino, I have learned a compass-and-straightedge construction from only cotangent and tangent. This led to an analogous construction from cosine and secant, as well as a guess-and-adjust one for sine and secant (And their analogous co-forms, obviously). Edit II: After some thinking, the guess-and-adjust construction from sine and secant has yielded to the compass and straightedge! First, construct a semicircle with a diameter of the secant. Second, construct a perpendicular anywhere along the line of the secant and mark off the sine along the perpendicular. Third, construct a perpendicular from the free end of the sine on the original perpendicular; call this the parallel. Where the parallel hits the semicircle (provided the semicircle and the sine are on the same side, this will happen twice) will be a possible point for the right angle between tangent and radius. Drop the sine from either point to the secant and then construct the tangent and radius.

In my mind, these are more precise statements, because we can write them down, compose the symmetries, construct the Cayley table, etc., but the intuitive processes of ""rotate around center"", ""reflect in the middle"", and ""translate by a few units"" seem like ghosts of our intuition. There's not much we can do with them. If we don't put labels on the triangle, there's no way to reason about its symmetries. It has no distinguishing features. For example, if we don't label the plane with real numbers to make it $\mathbf{R}^{2}$, we can't talk about the plane rotating, reflecting, shearing, expanding, etc., because it will look the same no matter what we do to it. No point of the plane is prioritised over the other.

23,The origin is not in the convex hull $\Rightarrow$ the set lies in a hemisphere?,The origin is not in the convex hull  the set lies in a hemisphere?,\Rightarrow,"I am trying to understand the proof of the following claim: Let $f:A \subseteq \mathbb{S}^n \to \mathbb{S}^n$ be an $L$-Lipschitz* map (with $L <1$). Then $f(A)$ is contained in the interior of a hemisphere. *The distance on $\mathbb{S}^n$ can be either the intrinsic one or the extrinsic (Euclidean) one, it does not matter. In the standard proof I have found here (pg 7, lemma 2.8), the author shows that the convex hull of $f(A)$ in the unit ball of $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ does not contain the origin. Why is this enough to deduce the claim? Edit: As commented by Jyrki Lahtonen, if a convex hull of a set $B$ is closed , then it is the intersection of all closed half-spaces containing $B$. From this the following key-lemma follows: Lemma: A closed convex set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ which does not contain the origin $\bar O$ is contained in a closed half-space which does not contain $\bar O$. In particular, $B$ is contained in the interior of a half-space whose boundary does contain $\bar O$. Proof: Suppose $B \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is closed and convex. $$\bar O \notin B=\operatorname{Conv}(B)=\cap_{\text{half-space } \, H, B \subseteq H} H$$ so there exist a closed half-space $H$ containing $B$ which does not contain the origin. $H$ can be written in the form of $H:=\{ y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}| \langle y,v \rangle \ge  c\}$ where $v \in \mathbb{R}^{n},c \in \mathbb{R}$. $\bar O \notin H \Rightarrow c>0$. Thus, $$ B \subseteq \{ y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}| \langle y,v \rangle \ge  c > 0\} $$ is contained in the interior of the half-space $D=\{ y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}| \langle y,v \rangle \ge  0\}, \bar O \in \operatorname{bd} D$. Note: The lemma is false if $B$ is not closed. Take for instance $$B=\{ (x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2 \,| \, x \ge 0, y \ge 0 \} \setminus {(0,0)}$$ $B$ is convex, $\bar O \notin B$, but any closed half-space containing $B$, must contain $\bar O$. However, $B$ is contained in the interior of a half-space whose boundary does contain $\bar O$, the halh-space $\{ (x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2 \,| \, x + y \ge 0 \}$. The lemma implies the claim for when $f(A)$ is  compact: This still leaves open the question whether or not, the claim holds in more general case. Proof: First, observe that compactness of $f(A)$ implies closedness of $\operatorname{Conv}(f(A))$. So, by the lemma there exist a closed half-space $H$ containing $f(A)$ which does not contain the origin. $H$ can be written in the form of $H:=\{ y \in \mathbb{R}^{n+1}| \langle y,v \rangle \ge  c > 0\}$ where $v \in \mathbb{R}^{n+1},c \in \mathbb{R}$.

31,Are all triangles isosceles?,Are all triangles isosceles?,,"There is a rather involved (and it is claimed, well-known) proof that shows that all triangles are isosceles (it can be found in Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries - Marvin Jay Greenberg, bottom of pg. 23) - but unfortunately after studying it, I cannot seem to find the flaw in the argument. Your help would be much appreciated. It claims: Given triangle ABC. Construct the bisector of angle A and the perpendicular bisector of side BC opposite to angle A. Now consider the various cases (there are diagrams given in the book). Case 1: The bisector of angle A and the perpendicular bisector of segment BC are either parallel or identical. In either case, the bisector of angle A is perpendicular to BC and hence, by definition, is an altitude. Therefore the triangle is isosceles (The conclusion follows from the Euclidean theorem that states: if an angle bisector and altitude from the same vertex of a triangle coincide, the triangle is isosceles.) Suppose now that the bisector of angle A and the perpendicular bisector of the side opposite are not parallel and do not coincide. Then they intersect in exactly one point, D, and there are 3 cases to consider: Case 2: The point D is inside the triangle  Case 3: The point D is on the triangle  Case 4: The point D is outside the triangle For each case, construct DE perpendicular to AB and DF perpendicular to AC, and for cases 2 and 4 join D to B and D to C. In each case the following proof now holds: (I don't have the appropriate symbol for congruence on my keyboard so I'll use '=' to mean congruence.) DE = DF because all points on an angle bisector are equidistant from the sides of the angle DA = DA, and angle DEA and angle DFA are right angles Hence triangle ADE is congruent to triangle ADF by the hypotenuse-leg theorem of Euclidean Geometry. Therefore, we have AE = AF. Now, DB = DC because all points on the perpendicular bisector of a segment are equidistant from the ends of the segment. Also, DE = DF, and angle DEB and angle DFC are right angles. Hence, triangle DEB is congruent to triangle DFC by the hypotenuse-leg theorem, and hence FC = BE.

Unfortunately, this answer is not sufficient for my applications (for mathematical economics). My applications consider two specific convex closed sets (one is polyhedron, the other is a cone) and a specific projection operator. I want to understand/derive some intuitive sufficient conditions on both sets and the projection operator that guarantee that the projections of the intersection equal the intersection of projections. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you, Alex",,"['geometry', 'convex-analysis']"

For $R \circ P$ : Let $R$ be a rotation where $R=R_{A,\alpha}$ where A is the center of rotation and $\alpha$ is the angle of rotation. Let $p$ be the reflection $p=p_k$ where $k$ is a line. Now let the line which goes through $A$ be parallel to $K$ and let the line $n$ be another line through $A$ whose oriented angle from $m$ is $\frac{\alpha}{2}$ Then observe: Since rotations can be expressed as two reflections, we shall substitute: $ R \circ P=(p_n \circ p_m) \circ p_k=p_n \circ (p_m \circ p_k)$ Since $p_m \circ p_k$ is a translation because lines m and k are parallel. As a result, a reflection composed with a translation is a glide reflection.

What I'm trying to do is find the corner entry , and corner exit . The path in the middle would be known as sector . The corner entry and exits are labelled in green in the following image, (Note where they are position in the road is the job of my AI algorithm thus for this, we are placing these entry and exit points in the middle). The following are the observations I made for the entry/exist points: entry have close to zero slope and then a change of slope. exit have changing slopes before it until a point with zero slopes is hit. For corners with ""S"" like formation, the inflection point is both an entry/exit point. Also we are ignoring z-axis. My plan so far is the following: take the first derivative of each point via parametric derivative, $\dfrac{dy}{dx} = \dfrac{\dfrac{dy}{dt}}{\dfrac{dx}{dt}}$. From (1), I will take the vertices that have the last 0 slope prior to change of slope (indicating corner entry). From (1), I will take the vertices that is the first 0 slope after a sequence of non-zero slope, indicating corner exit. (Note that the first derivative also takes in inflection points, since inflection points have 0 slope). Problem: My plan seems to not work and places corner exit and entry in wrong places (e.g. lump in straight aways). Considering that corner entry often have gentle slopes, this sometimes doesn't place the entry point until we are deep in the corner (which is bad). I've been debugging this problem for quite a while so before I go on I have two main questions: If my idea is right (or close to right), could it be that my implementation is wrong? If you have a better method of finding corner sectors , can you share it with me? Edit: I thank both answers. My level is too low to thumbs up so I have to use prng to select one answer. Anyway, the program is working perfectly. The following is the line graph generated by curvature along the circuit: Basically, the local minimums corresponds to straight-away. It even captures the big irregular hairpin with smaller straight away. One could even incorporate filtering to avoid the noise.

The corner entry and exits are labelled in green in the following image, (Note where they are position in the road is the job of my AI algorithm thus for this, we are placing these entry and exit points in the middle). The following are the observations I made for the entry/exist points: entry have close to zero slope and then a change of slope. exit have changing slopes before it until a point with zero slopes is hit. For corners with ""S"" like formation, the inflection point is both an entry/exit point. Also we are ignoring z-axis. My plan so far is the following: take the first derivative of each point via parametric derivative, $\dfrac{dy}{dx} = \dfrac{\dfrac{dy}{dt}}{\dfrac{dx}{dt}}$. From (1), I will take the vertices that have the last 0 slope prior to change of slope (indicating corner entry). From (1), I will take the vertices that is the first 0 slope after a sequence of non-zero slope, indicating corner exit. (Note that the first derivative also takes in inflection points, since inflection points have 0 slope). Problem: My plan seems to not work and places corner exit and entry in wrong places (e.g. lump in straight aways). Considering that corner entry often have gentle slopes, this sometimes doesn't place the entry point until we are deep in the corner (which is bad). I've been debugging this problem for quite a while so before I go on I have two main questions: If my idea is right (or close to right), could it be that my implementation is wrong? If you have a better method of finding corner sectors , can you share it with me? Edit: I thank both answers. My level is too low to thumbs up so I have to use prng to select one answer. Anyway, the program is working perfectly. The following is the line graph generated by curvature along the circuit: Basically, the local minimums corresponds to straight-away. It even captures the big irregular hairpin with smaller straight away. One could even incorporate filtering to avoid the noise.

I generally like to try to solve problems instead of looking up the answer, but this week a student emailed me a problem that I don't think I'll be able to solve on my own.
