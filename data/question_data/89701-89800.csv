I have already proven that d is a metric; it is defined by: $$ d(f,g)= \sum_{k=1}^\infty 2^{-k} \min\{1, |f(k)-g(k)| \} .$$ For this implication, I have the following so far: Assume that $\forall k\in \mathbb{N}, \{f_n(k)\}_{n=1}^\infty \subset \mathbb{R}$ converges in $\mathbb{R}$ to some point $p\in \mathbb{R}$.

Note that $|f_n(k)-p|\leq \min\{1,|f_n(k)-p|\}$ and $0<2^{k}<1$ for all $1\leq k< \infty$, so then for the same set of $k$ values we have that $2^{-k} \min\{1,|f_n(k)-p|\}< |f_n(k)-p|<\epsilon$. From here, I wanted to add all the $2^{-k} \min\{1,|f_n(k)-p|\}$ was less that $\epsilon  \,\times $ the number of $k$'s, but there are infinite $k$ values so that wouldn't really work. Also, I realized that I assumed all the sequences for the different $k$ values converge to the same point, which I don't think is guaranteed.

This should be simple but for some reason I'm not seeing it. Obviously this follows from the $d=2$ case, and I wanted to somehow change variables in such a way that I end up with only one variable (because $d^n/dx^n$ clearly has an infinite dimensional kernel - at least all functions of only $y$) but I'm not really sure what that means.

34,"Fredholm Alternative as seen in PDEs, part 2","Fredholm Alternative as seen in PDEs, part 2",,"...continued from part 1. I have more questions concerning more of Evans' proof in the Fredholm Alternative. As stated in my previous question, I do not have functional analysis background, but I want to still understand the proof. So my five questions will be fundamental and basic. Any answers and clarifications are welcomed. NB: For anyone who is about to suggest me to read suggested books or point out that I have a lack of background in functional analysis (and even theoretical linear algebra), please don't. Because I already know that. As suggested by a user on my previous question, I plan to read the Haim Brezis textbook over the summer when I don't have classes in the regular school semesters. With that said, I am printing the theorem below, along with the second excerpt of the textbook's proof and my basic questions to follow. (PDE Evans, Appendix D, Theorem 5) THEOREM 5 (Fredholm Alternative) . Let $K : H \to H$ be a compact linear operator. Then (i) $N(I-K)$ is finite dimensional, (ii) $R(I-K)$ is closed, (iii) $R(I-K)=N(I-K^*)^\perp$ , (iv) $N(I-K)=\{0\}$ if and only if $R(I-K)=H$ , and (v) $\dim N(I-K)=\dim N(I-K^*)$ . The second excerpt of the textbook proof: Assertion (iii) is now a consequence of (ii) and the general fact that $$\overline{R(A)}=N(A^*)^\perp \text{ for each bounded linear operator }A: H \to H.$$ a. Can the overline in $\overline{R(A)}$ be explained? Why do we not need the overline for statement (iii), $R(I-K)=N(I-K^*)^\perp$ ? To verify (iv), let us suppose to start with that $N(I-K)=\{0\}$ , but $H_1=(I-K)(H) \subsetneq H$ . According to (ii), $H_1$ is a closed subspace of $H$ . Furthermore $H_2 \equiv (I-K)(H_1) \subsetneq H_1$ , since $I-K$ is one-to-one. Similarly if we write $H_k \equiv (I-K)^k(H)$ ( $k=1,\ldots$ ), we see that $H_k$ is a closed subspace of $H$ , $H_{k+1} \subsetneq H_k$ ( $k=1,\ldots$ ). Conversely, choose $u_k \in H_k$ with $\|u_k\|=1$ , $u_k \in H_{k+1}^\perp$ . Then $Ku_k-Ku_l=-(u_k-Ku_k)+(u_l-Ku_l)+(u_k-u_l)$ . Now if $k > l$ , $H_{k+1} \subsetneq H_k \subseteq H_{l+1} \subsetneq H_l$ . Thus $u_k-Ku_k$ , $u_l-Ku_l$ , $u_k \in H_{l+1}$ . Since $u_l \in H_{l+1}^\perp$ , $\|u_l\|=1$ , we deduce $\|Ku_k-Ku_l\| \ge 1$ ( $k,l=1,\ldots$ ). But this is impossible since $K$ is compact. b. I know that $I$ and $K$ considered linear transformations because $I$ is the identity operator (is this true?) and $K$ is given to be a compact linear operator. Hence, $I-K$ is a linear transformation, right? Due to a theorem from linear algebra, is it because $I-K$ established to be one-to-one because the nullspace $N(I-K)=\{0\}$ as initially given? c. Why does the one-to-one property $I-K$ implies that we can write $H_2 \equiv (I-K)(h_1) \subsetneq H_1$ , which would allow us to write after $k$ iterations $H_k \equiv (I-K)^k(H)$ ? d. How does $u_l \in H_{l+1}^\perp$ and $\|u_l\|=1$ suggest $\|Ku_k - Ku_l\| \ge 1$ , which would make $\{Ku_k\}$ not Cauchy and contradict the compactness of $K$ ? Ultimately, I cannot right now see the connection that allows us to conclude that the rank $R(I-K)=H$ , thereby proving the forward direction of (iv)... Now conversely assume $R(I-K)=H$ . Then owing to (iii), we see that $N(I-K^*)=\{0\}$ . Since $K^*$ is compact, we may utilize step 5 to conclude $R(I-K^*)=H$ . But then $N(I-K)=R(I-K^*)^\perp=\{0\}$ . This conclusion and step 5 complete the proof of assertion (iv). e. Given $R(I-K)=H$ , because of (iii) we have $N(I-K^*)^\perp=H$ . But how does the transpose of $N$ equivalency with $H$ imply $N(I-K)=\{0\}$ ? Follow-up part 3...","...continued from part 1.

98,Regular value theorem and sard's theorem for banach manifolds,Regular value theorem and sard's theorem for banach manifolds,,"I have been reading about floer homology , and alot of banach (infinite) dimensional manifolds tend to appear. To try and deal with them results such as the inifinite dimensional analogue of the regular value theorem and the sard-smale theorem that applies to fredholm appear. Now I think to prove the regular value theorem we can just try an use the analogue of the implicit function theorem for banach spaces, but then when we are dealing with fredholm operators I belive we can determine the dimension of the submanifold by the index of the operator. So my question is if anyone knows a reference that deals with this ""classical"" manifolds theorem but in infinite dimensions and dealing with tools from Functional analsysis ? Thanks in advance.","I have been reading about floer homology , and alot of banach (infinite) dimensional manifolds tend to appear.
