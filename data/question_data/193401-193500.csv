Here: $\vec{y}$ is an $n \times 1$ vector $X$ is an $ n \times p$ matrix $\beta$ is a $p \times 1$ vector In particular, say I just want to expand the original expression like this: $$f(\beta) = (\vec{y} -X\beta)^T(\vec{y} -X\beta) = (\vec{y}^T -\beta^TX^T)(\vec{y} -X\beta).$$ Then, I want to just apply the product rule $$\frac{\mathrm{d}f(\beta)}{\mathrm{d}\beta} =-X^T(\vec{y} -X\beta) - (\vec{y}^T -\beta^TX^T)X = $$ $$ = -X^T\vec{y} + X^TX\beta-\vec{y}^TX+\beta^TX^TX =$$ $$= -X^T\vec{y}+X^TX\beta-(X^T\vec{y})^T + (X^TX\beta)^T.$$ But this doesn't work because the first two terms have dimensions $p \times 1$ , while the last two have dimensions $1 \times p$ .

It may also help to bear in mind that I have only just started teaching myself calculus and so far I have only covered differential calculus up to the level taught in secondary schools. The question is in two parts (I understand that to answer (i) you simply find $f'(x)$ and evaluate $f'(e)$ to show that it is equal to zero and is therefore, since there is only one stationary point which is a maximum point as implied by the question, the maximum point): $f(x) = {\ln x\over x}$, $x\gt 0$ (i) Show that the maximum point on the graph of $y = f(x)$ occurs at the point $\left(e,\frac{1}{e}\right)$.
