Next definition: A deciding problem $A=(X,Y)$ is in $NP$ if there is a polynomial $p$ and a deciding problem $B=(X',Y')\in P$ so that the following holds: $X' = \{x\#c \,\,|\,\ x\in X, \, c\in \{0,1\}^{\lfloor p(\text{size}(x) \rfloor}\}$ and $Y = \{y \in X \,\,|\,\,\exists c\in\{0,1\}^{\lfloor p(\text{size}(x) \rfloor}\,:\,y\#c \in Y'\}$ So I understand this definition the following way: Given some $x\in X$ we want to know if $x \in Y$ .

So, using the notation of the close answer, I don't understand why I have to rule out the tuples $(T,T)$ and $(F,F)$ . Let's call the sentence ""Q is necessary but not sufficient for P"" R. As for $(F,F)$ , if P is false when Q is also false, this should result in R = true; since Q is necessary for P, so the absence of Q should imply the absence of P. Why would I want R to be false in this case? And for $(T,T)$ , I will imagine a more complete picture. Let's say that P depends on Q and some other factors, collectively named W. Now, we should split the row $(T,T)$ into 2, one with W false, and another with W true. In the case with W true, R should evaluate to T, and in the case with W false, R should evaluate to false. On what basis, then, should we decide to rule out $(T,T)$ in the original statement! In my opinion, the row with $(T,T)$ should be undecidable.

69,There exists a unique path linking every two vertices in a tree $T$,There exists a unique path linking every two vertices in a tree,T,"I've come up with what feels like a really convoluted proof for a fairly simple theorem. There are a few points I'd like to improve upon: I dislike using the physical language of ""following"" a path -- it feels more like an appeal to intuition than something that belongs in a formal proof. Can you suggest an alternate way of framing this? I'm not entirely convinced by my own proof -- in part (I) , for example, how do we know for sure that ""following"" (ugh, I did it again! :)) $P_1 \cup P_2$ will lead to a vertex in $P_1 \cap P_1 \triangle P_2$ ?

Can you suggest a simpler proof? To clarify notation: By a graph I mean a pair $(V, E)$ with $V$ a set of elements called vertices, and $E = \{ \{v_1, v_2\} : v_1, v_2 \in V\}$ . I take a path to be a nonempty graph with $E = \{ \{ v_0, v_1\}, \{ v_1, v_2 \}, ..., \{v_{k-1}, v_k\}\}$ where the $v_i$ are distinct. The set theoretic operations I define as being applied componentwise to the elements of $G$ -- so $G_1 \cap G_2 = (V_{G_1} \cap V_{G_2}, E_{G_1} \cap E_{G_2})$ . I take this notation mostly from Diestel (maybe except for the abuse of the notation for set theoretic operations). Theorem There exists a unique path linking every two vertices in a tree $T$ Proof Existence follows from the definition of a tree (a connected acyclic graph). We show uniqueness as follows: let $P_1$ and $P_2$ be paths linking vertices $x_0, x_k \in T$ with $P_1 \neq P_2$ . Take the symmetric difference $P_1 \triangle P_2$ . Note that $P_1 \triangle P_2$ must be nonempty, since $P_1 \neq P_2$ . Further, $P_1 \cap (P_1 \triangle P_2) \neq \emptyset$ and $P_2 \cap (P_1 \triangle P_2) \neq \emptyset$ (otherwise we would have, for example, $P_1 \subset P_2$ , which is impossible since by hypothesis both paths link $x_0$ and $x_k$ ). If $P_1 \cap P_1 \triangle P_2 = P_1$ and $P_2 \cap P_1 \triangle P_2 = P_2$ (if one of these is true, both are true), then we have a cycle with $P_1 \cup P_2$ . Otherwise, follow $P_1 \cup P_2$ until we arrive at a vertex of $P_1 \triangle P_2$ . (I) Follow $P_1 \cup P_2$ until we arrive at a vertex $v$ in $P_1 \triangle P_2$ . This vertex is adjacent to vertices in both $P_1 \cap P_1 \triangle P_2$ and $P_2 \cap P_1 \triangle P_2$ . Then we can follow $P_1 \cap P_1 \triangle P_2$ until we reach a vertex in $P_2 \cap P_1 \triangle P_2$ , and follow $P_2 \cap P_1 \triangle P_2$ back to $v$ .

If balls are drawn, what is the probability that of them are red and green? Solution 1: Total number of ways is Favorable number of ways = So required probability = Solution 2:    However since the favorable number of ways is obtained by multiplying and , it takes the order between two red and one green in to account while the total number of ways does not take order in to account.  Should I therefore divide by to get the accurate favorable number of ways? so required probability will be Solution 3: Total number of ways = (counting in way to account for order) Favorable number of ways = (to also account for order like in denominator) So required probability = ) I understand that as long as we are consistent in taking in to account the order when counting favorable and total ways, we should get the same probability.
