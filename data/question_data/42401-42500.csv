Exercise: Let $R$ be a commutative ring, and let $I_1,\ldots,I_d$ be pairwise comaximal ideals. Prove that $R/\left(\bigcap_{k=1}^d I_k\right) \simeq \prod_{k=1}^d R/I_k$, via the map $\varphi: R\rightarrow \prod R/I_k$ given by $r \mapsto (r+I_1,\ldots,r+I_d)$. The kernel of $\varphi$ is precisely $\bigcap_{k=1}^d I_k$, so the goal of the argument is to show that $\varphi$ is surjective. Eisenbud hints to use his Corollary 2.9, which states the following. Lemma: Let $\varphi:M\rightarrow N$ be an $R$-module homomorphism. Then $\varphi$ is surjective if and only if the induced map $\varphi_{\mathfrak{m}} : M_{\mathfrak{m}} \rightarrow N_\mathfrak{m}$ is surjective for every maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ of $R$. (Specifically, the map $\varphi_\mathfrak{m}$ is given by $m/u \mapsto \varphi(m)/u$.) I have a few problems with this. The lemma is a statement about module homomorphisms, but the $\varphi$ appearing in the Chinese Remainder Theorem is not a module homomorphism (it's a ring homomorphism). I tried to change the lemma to work for ring homomorphisms, but ran into the following problem. Even if $\varphi:R\rightarrow S$ is a ring homomorphism, how does $\varphi_\mathfrak{m} : R_\mathfrak{m} \rightarrow S_\mathfrak{m}$ make sense? I get that you can localize $R$ at a maximal ideals, but what does ""$S_\mathfrak{m}$"" mean when $\mathfrak{m}$ is a maximal ideal of $R$? (Note this post , which actually gives the failure of the lemma for ring homomorphisms -- except in that context we localize $S$ at a prime ideal of $S$, and then localize $R$ at the preimage of that prime ideal.) Regarding the second remark above, I was thinking that one could view $S$ as an $R$-module by $rs:=\varphi(r)s$, and then consider $S_\mathfrak{m}$ as a localization of an $R$-module by a maximal ideal. But then in order for $\varphi_\mathfrak{m}:R_\mathfrak{m}\rightarrow S_\mathfrak{m}$ to be a ring homomorphism, one has to decide how $S_\mathfrak{m}$ is a ring and then define how to induce a ring homomorphism on localization. This seems like a lot for Eisenbud to sweep under the rug when he says to use the Lemma to solve the exercise. So as far as I understand, the above lemma isn't even relevant to the exercise.

Explanation of terminology: $\mu_n \subset \mathbb{C}$ is the cyclic group of nth roots of unity, with multiplication as the group action. Pick $\epsilon \in \mathbb{C}$ to be a primitive nth root of unity, so that $\mu_n = \langle \epsilon \rangle$.

Apply $\varphi$ to this last equation and use linear independence of $u^av^b$ in $\mathbb{C}[u,v]$ and equation (1) to get linear equations of the form: (expression in $b$s) = (expression in $a$s).

I would like to show that the rings $\mathbb{C}[u,v]^{\mu_n}$ and $\mathbb{C}[x,y,z]/(xy-z^n)$ are isomorphic. Explanation of terminology: $\mu_n \subset \mathbb{C}$ is the cyclic group of nth roots of unity, with multiplication as the group action. Pick $\epsilon \in \mathbb{C}$ to be a primitive nth root of unity, so that $\mu_n = \langle \epsilon \rangle$. To say that $\mu_n$ acts on $\mathbb{C}[u,v]$ with weights $(1,-1)$ means that the action of $\mu_n$ on $\mathbb{C}[u,v]$ is defined by setting $\epsilon \cdot u = \epsilon u$, $\epsilon\cdot v = \epsilon^{-1}v$ and extending polynomially. Define $\mathbb{C}[u,v]^{\mu_n}$ to be the subring of $\mathbb{C}[u,v]$ consisting of polynomials that are invariant under the given action of $\mu_n$ on $\mathbb{C}[u,v]$. I want to show that there is an isomorphism of rings: $\mathbb{C}[u,v]^{\mu_n} \cong \mathbb{C}[x,y,z]/(xy-z^n)$. My partial solution: $\mathbb{C}[u,v]^{\mu_n}$ can be identified as the subring $\mathbb{C}[u^n,v^n,uv] \subset \mathbb{C}[u,v]$. So the problem is to show that $\mathbb{C}[u^n,v^n,uv] \cong \mathbb{C}[x,y,z]/(xy-z^n)$. There is a surjective ring homomoprhism $\varphi: \mathbb{C}[x,y,z] \to \mathbb{C}[u^n,v^n,uv]$ defined by $x \mapsto u^n, y\mapsto v^n, z \mapsto uv$. A direct check shows that $(xy-z^n) \subset \ker{\varphi}$. The difficulty: I am unable to show the reverse inclusion, $\ker{\varphi} \subset (xy-z^n)$. Any help will be appreciated.

A directed group or do-group is a po-group that is an (up and down) directed set . A lattice ordered group or lo-group is a po-group that is a lattice . A totally ordered group or to-group is a po-group that is a totally ordered set. The (positive) cone of $G$ is $G_{\geq1}\!=\!G_+\!:=\!\{g\!\in\!G;\, g\!\geq\!1\}$.

Probably one just has to write down an inverse element, but I could not find it. Perhaps there is a trick related to the geometric series which motivates the choice of the inverse element, which can be actually made into a formal proof because the series is finite since $a(1-a)$ is nilpotent? Here is a proof that the two-sided ideal generated by $1+a(t-1)$ is $R[t,t^{-1}]$ (which already finishes the proof when $R$ is commutative): Let $A$ be the quotient, we have to show $A=0$. Now, $A$ contains elements $a,t$ such that $a(1-a)$ is nilpotent, $t$ is invertible and $(1-a) + ta = 0$. If we multiply this equation by $a^u (1-a)^v$, we see that $a^{u+1}(1-a)^v=0 \Rightarrow a^u (1-a)^v = 0$ as well as $a^u (1-a)^{v+1} = 0 \Rightarrow a^u (1-a)^v = 0$ for all $u,v \geq 0$. Since $a(1-a)$ is nilpotent, we get by induction that $a$ and $1-a$ are nilpotent. But $a$ nilpotent implies that $1-a$ is a unit, so it can only be nilpotent when $A=0$. As mt_ mentions below, the general case may be reduced to the commutative case by working with the commutative subring $\mathbb{Z}[a] \subseteq R$.

Motivation: Given a subring of a power series ring in one variable which can be written as, $k[[x^{a_1},...,x^{a_n}]]$ where $a_1,...,a_n$ are distinct positive integers, we have a homomorphism $k[[x_1,...,x_n]]\to k[[x^{a_1},...,x^{a_n}]]$ which sends $x_i\to x^{a_i}$.

53,"Exercise 5.22 in Isaacs' ""Character Theory of Finite Groups""","Exercise 5.22 in Isaacs' ""Character Theory of Finite Groups""",,"Let $G$ be a finite group and let $\chi$ be a rational character of $G$ . A theorem due to Artin states that $|G| \chi$ is a $\mathbb{Z}$ -linear combination of characters of the form $(1_H){\uparrow}^G$ , where $H \leq G$ is a cyclic subgroup. It's a fact (see, for instance, exercise 5.20 of the same book by Isaacs) that the set $P(G)$ of $\mathbb{Z}$ -linear combinations of characters of the form $(1_H){\uparrow}^G$ , for $H \leq G$ (not necessarily cyclic here) is a ring. The problem I'm trying to solve is as follows: Let $n_G(\chi)$ the the smallest non-zero natural number such that $n_G(\chi)\chi \in P(G)$ and let $N = \ker \chi$ , so that $\chi$ may be considered a character of $G/N$ . Show that $n_G(\chi) = n_{G/N}(\chi)$ . The following hint is also provided: Hint: Writing $n\chi = \sum a_H (1_H){\uparrow}^G$ , show $n\chi = \sum a_H (1_{NH}){\uparrow}^G$ by obtaining $(1_H){\uparrow}^G = (1_{NH}){\uparrow}^G + \xi_H$ , where $N$ isn't contained in the kernel of any of the constituents of $\xi_H$ . My attempt Assuming the hint as given: It's trivial (from the hint) that $n_{G/N}(\chi) \leq n_G(\chi)$ . Furthermore, if $m\chi = \sum a_\overline{H} (1_\overline{H}){\uparrow}^G$ , the correspondence theorem yields $m\chi = \sum a_{NH} (1_{NH}){\uparrow}^G$ . Thus, $n_{G/N}(\chi) \geq n_G(\chi)$ and we are done. Proving the hint: I first tried to show that every constituent of $(1_{NH}){\uparrow}^G$ is also a constituent of $(1_{H}){\uparrow}^G$ . This was relatively simple: $$\langle (1_{NH}){\uparrow}^G, \eta \rangle > 0 \iff \langle 1_{NH}, \eta {\mid}_{NH} \rangle > 0 \iff \eta {\mid}_{NH} = 1_{NH} + \sum \eta_i$$ Restricting $\eta$ to $H$ , we get at least one component of $1_H$ , which gives me the result. That said: How do I know all these constituents appear in $(1_H){\uparrow}^G$ the same number of times they do in $(1_{NH}){\uparrow}^G?$ In principle, some of the $\eta_i$ may be different from $1_{NH}$ but also restrict to $1_H$ - and this can't happen if the hint is true... Also: How do I show that every constituent of $(1_H){\uparrow}^G$ containing $N$ in its kernel has to be a constituent of $(1_{NH}){\uparrow}^G$ ?

75,Incomparability of Prime ideals in integral Ring Extensions,Incomparability of Prime ideals in integral Ring Extensions,,"I'm having an issue with the theorem on incomparability of prime ideals in integral ring extensions, which I have stated as follows: Let $ R \subseteq S$ be an integral extension of commutative rings (with identity), and suppose that $P_{1} \subseteq P_{2}$ are two prime ideals of $S$ such that $R \cap P_{1} = R \cap P_{2} $, then $P_{1} = P_{2}$ The proof of which requires the following lemma: Let $R \subseteq S$ be an integral extension of commutative rings (with identity), with $S$ an integral domain. If $I$ is a non-zero ideal of $S$, then $R \cap I \neq \{ 0 \}$. The proof proceeds as follows: Let $Q = R \cap P_{1} = R \cap P_{2}$. Then $R / Q \subseteq S / P_{1}$ is an integral extension with $P_{2} / P_{1}$ an ideal of the domain $S / P_{1}$ such that $P_{2} / P_{1} \cap R / Q = Q / Q = \{ \bar{0} \} $, and so by the lemma $P_{2} / P_{1}$ is the zero ideal of $S / P_{1}$. Hence $P_{2} \subseteq P_{1} \subseteq P_{2}$ and so $P_{1} = P_{2}$ My issue with this is this proof only seems to require the primality of $P_{1}$, since the only place that primality is required is to ensure that $S / P_{1}$ is a domain so that we can apply the lemma. Am I correct that the primality of $P_{2}$ is not needed in the statement of incomparability? And if so is there a reason it is stated as needing $P_{2}$ to be prime too? $\textbf{Edit: }$ I posted this as a comment below, but I thought it might be worthwhile to replicate this here, since it serves as my motivation for asking this question, and provides a concrete example for where this stronger / generalised form of the statement of incomparability is useful. Though, I do acknowledge that, as mentioned below, it's not hard to alter this proof to allow us to apply the typical form of incomparability. $\textbf{Claim: }$ An integral extension of a Jacobson Ring is a Jacobson Ring. $\textbf{Proof :}$ Let $R \subseteq S$ be an integral extension of rings and let $I$ be a prime ideal of $S$. Then since $R$ is Jacobson, and $(I \cap R)$ is a prime ideal of $R$, there are maximal ideals of $R$, $\{ M_{i} \}_{i=1}^{l}$ say, such that $(I \cap R) = \cap_{i=1}^{l} (M_{i})$. Then for each $i$ the chain $(I \cap R) \subseteq M_{i}$ is a chain of prime ideals of $R$ with $I$ a prime ideal of $S$ laying over $(I \cap R)$, and so by the going up theorem there are primes ideals of $S$, $\{ N_{i} \}_{i=1}^{l}$ say, each containing $I$ and each lying over its respective $M_{i}$. Then $N_{i}$ is a prime ideal lying over a maximal ideal, so is itself maximal. Then let $I' = \cap_{i=1}^{l} (N_{i})$. Then $I \subseteq I'$ are ideals of $S$ with $I$ prime and  $$ (I' \cap R) = ( \cap_{i=1}^{l} (N_{i})) \cap R = \cap_{i=1}^{l} (N_{i} \cap R) = \cap_{i=1}^{l} (M_{i}) = (I \cap R)  $$ and so by the more general form of incomparability, noticing crucially I have not proved primality of $I'$, we see that $I = I'$. Hence $I$ is an finite intersection of maximal ideals of $S$, and so since $I$ was arbitrary in $S$ amongst the prime ideals of $S$, we see that $S$ is Jacobson. $\textbf{ Remark: }$ My proof here also uses a more specific form of the going up theorem than the one I was provided with. The statement of the going up theorem I have states that if $ \{Q_{i}\}$ is a strictly increasing chain of prime ideals in $R$, then there is a strictly increasing chain of prime ideal in $S$, $ \{P_{i}\}$ say, such that $P_{i} \cap R = Q_{i}$. However since the proof of this is inductive, and you start by choosing a prime ideal $P_{1}$ (whose existence is guaranteed by a simpler lemma) in $S$ laying over $Q_{1}$, we see that in fact if we already have a partially completed chain in $S$ we can use going up to complete it. Which is exactly what I have done in the proof above.","I'm having an issue with the theorem on incomparability of prime ideals in integral ring extensions, which I have stated as follows: Let $ R \subseteq S$ be an integral extension of commutative rings (with identity), and suppose that $P_{1} \subseteq P_{2}$ are two prime ideals of $S$ such that $R \cap P_{1} = R \cap P_{2} $, then $P_{1} = P_{2}$ The proof of which requires the following lemma: Let $R \subseteq S$ be an integral extension of commutative rings (with identity), with $S$ an integral domain. If $I$ is a non-zero ideal of $S$, then $R \cap I \neq \{ 0 \}$. The proof proceeds as follows: Let $Q = R \cap P_{1} = R \cap P_{2}$. Then $R / Q \subseteq S / P_{1}$ is an integral extension with $P_{2} / P_{1}$ an ideal of the domain $S / P_{1}$ such that $P_{2} / P_{1} \cap R / Q = Q / Q = \{ \bar{0} \} $, and so by the lemma $P_{2} / P_{1}$ is the zero ideal of $S / P_{1}$. Hence $P_{2} \subseteq P_{1} \subseteq P_{2}$ and so $P_{1} = P_{2}$ My issue with this is this proof only seems to require the primality of $P_{1}$, since the only place that primality is required is to ensure that $S / P_{1}$ is a domain so that we can apply the lemma. Am I correct that the primality of $P_{2}$ is not needed in the statement of incomparability? And if so is there a reason it is stated as needing $P_{2}$ to be prime too? $\textbf{Edit: }$ I posted this as a comment below, but I thought it might be worthwhile to replicate this here, since it serves as my motivation for asking this question, and provides a concrete example for where this stronger / generalised form of the statement of incomparability is useful.

Then $N_{i}$ is a prime ideal lying over a maximal ideal, so is itself maximal. Then let $I' = \cap_{i=1}^{l} (N_{i})$.
