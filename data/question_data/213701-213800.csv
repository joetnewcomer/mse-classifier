97,An immediate alternative to a trigonometry problem (high school),An immediate alternative to a trigonometry problem (high school),,"I have a right triangle, $AH\perp BC$ , where $\cos \beta=\sqrt 5/5$ and $\overline{AH}+\overline{CH}+\overline{HB}=7$ . I have to found the area. My steps (or solution) : $$\mathcal A(\triangle ABC)=\frac 12\overline{AB}\cdot \overline{BC} \sin \beta$$ with $0<\beta<\pi$ . Hence $\sin \beta=\sqrt{1-5/25}=2\sqrt5/5$ . But $\overline{AB}=\overline{BC}\cos \beta$ and the area $$\mathcal A(\triangle ABC)=\frac12(\overline{BC}\cos \beta)\cdot (\overline{BC}\sin \beta)=\frac12\overline{BC}^2 \tag 1$$ We know that: $$\overline{AH}+\overline{CH}+\overline{HB}=7, \quad \text{with}\quad  \overline{CH}+\overline{HB}=\overline{BC}$$ Hence $$\overline{AH}+\overline{BC}=7 \iff \overline{BC}=7-\overline{AH}$$ and $\overline{AH}=\overline{AB}\cos\gamma=\overline{BC}\cos\gamma\cos\beta$ . Putting this last identity to the condition $\overline{BC}=7-\overline{AH}$ I will have: $$\overline{BC}=7-\overline{BC}\cos\gamma\cos\beta \iff \overline{BC}(1+\cos\gamma\cos\beta)=7$$ After, $$\overline{BC}=\frac{7}{1+\cos\gamma\cos\beta}$$ with $\cos \gamma=\cos(\pi/2-\cos\beta)=\sin\beta=2\sqrt5/5$ . Definitively $$\overline{BC}^2=\frac{49}{\left(1+\frac 25\right)^2}=\frac{49}{\frac{49}{25}}$$ and $$\mathcal{A}(\triangle ABC)=\frac15\overline{BC}^2=5 \tag 2$$ I'm very tired and often don't find immediate solutions to problems. I had thought of using Euclid's second theorem by placing $\overline{AH}=x$ and $\overline{BC}=y$ , and $x+y=7$ . After I will have $x^2=\overline{BH}\cdot \overline{CH}$ . But I have left this path. Can this possible alternative be used or is there another more immediate way?","I have a right triangle, , where and . I have to found the area. My steps (or solution) : with . Hence .
