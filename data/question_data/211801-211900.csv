(2 answers) Closed 7 years ago . I am a undergraduate majoring in CS. In preparation for a discrete mathematics exam coming up next week, I am looking through problems I got wrong on the homework. A concept I don't understand are surjections, injections, and bijection. From lecture, for a function to be a bijection, it has to be both an injection and a surjection. So say I proved a function is not a surjection, why couldn't I say that it has to be injection since we know it can't be a bijection by definition? So my homework problem is in the link below. Assignment Problem 4.26. Let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be sets and let $f\colon B\to C$ and $g\colon A\to B$ be functions. Let $h\colon A\to C$ be the composition, $f\circ g$, that is, $h(x)::=f(g(x))$ for $x\in A$. Prove or disprove the following claims. (a) If $h$ is surjective, then $f$ must be surjective. (b) If $h$ is surjective, then $g$ must be surjective. (c) If $h$ is injective, then $f$ must be injective. (d) If $h$ is injective and $f$ is total, then $g$ must be surjective I got  a) True b) False c) True d) False When the answer is supposed to be  a) True b) false c) false d) true I think the reason why I got them wrong is because I assumed that if a function is not surjective, then it has to be injective and vice versa. Could someone help me understand this concept? That would be much appreciated!","This question already has answers here : If $g \circ f$ is surjective, show that $f$ does not have to be surjective?

My question is, what if the question asks contain exactly one $3$ OR one $4$ OR one $5$? Let $A$ be the set which contains a number with a single $3$. Let $B$ be the set which contains a number with a single $4$. Let $C$ be the set which contains a number with a single $5$. $|A| = (9^4) \cdot 5$ $|B| = (9^4) \cdot 5$ $|C| = (9^4) \cdot 5$ $|A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C|$ How do I proceed? My further attempt: $|A \cap B| = 5C1 \cdot 4C1 \cdot 8 \cdot 8 \cdot 8 = 10240$ $|A \cap B| = |A \cap C| = |B \cap C| = 10240$ $|A \cap B \cap C| = 5C1 \cdot 4C1 \cdot 3C1 \cdot 7 \cdot 7 = 2940$ Answer $= 32805 + 32805 + 32805 - 10240 - 10240 - 10240 + 2940 = 70635$",,"['combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics', 'permutations']"

That is, the internal nodes are labelled with a bit position that you read, then depending on its value, you either go left or right and proceed to read the next bit indicated. The leaf nodes are labelled with a set of bits that are flipped to perform the increment operation. Note that the sequence of integers may not be the traditional Standard Binary Code, but could be any cyclic sequence of the $2^n$ integers. A Gray Code is another example of a sequence that may be produced (which corresponds to a Hamiltonian cycle in the hypercube graph). Now, consider the root to ""right before"" leaf paths as sets of size $r$ from a universe of size $n$. I am trying to argue the following claim: Suppose that the root node of our decision tree is labelled by index $i$. If we take the paths on the left side of the tree (when $i$ is read as  $0$) such that bit $i$ is not flipped, together with the paths on the right side of the tree (when $i$ is read as $1$) such that bit $i$ is flipped, then I am interested in bounding the size of the common intersection of those sets. In particular, we know that every set will contain index $i$ since it sits at our root node, but I would like to show that these sets must also have another bit in common.
