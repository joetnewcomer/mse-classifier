All elements in each $S_i$ are distinct for $1\leq i\leq 4$ .

Find the number of ways to form $S$ if $S$ has $a+b+c+d-3$ elements. $a+b+c+d-2$ elements. My try: Method 1: Note that $a+b+c+d-3=(a-1)+(b-1)+(c-1)+(d-1)+1$ . We first choose $a-1$ elements from $S_1$ in $\binom{a}{a-1}=a$ ways,then choose $b-1$ elements from $S_2$ in $\binom{b}{b-1}=b$ ways, then choose $c-1$ elements from $S_3$ in $\binom{c}{c-1}=c$ ways and finally choose $d-1$ elements from $S_4$ in $\binom{d}{d-1}=d$ ways. We now need to choose $1$ remaining  element of $S$ from $\bigcup_{i=1}^4 S_i$ . Now $1$ remaining  element of $S$ from $\bigcup_{i=1}^4 S_i$ can be chosen in $\binom{4}{1}=4$ ways.

59,The coefficient and asymptotic in generating function,The coefficient and asymptotic in generating function,,"Let $L_n$ be the set of all the paths from $(0,0)$ to $(n,0)$ such that every step is $u=(1,1)$ , $d=(1,-1)$ and $r=(2,0)$ . Notice that the path could go under the $x$ axis. a. Write a generating function of the number of paths in $L_n$ . b. Analyze the asymptotic of $|L_n|$ for a large n. My trial: in part a, I wrote: Every path = (empty path) or (r every path) or (u Schröder path d every path) or (d Schröder path u every path). Now, denote our g.f. by $A(x)$ and Schröder g.f. by $S(x)$ , and denote $x$ to count half of the length, get: $A(x)=1+xA(x)+xS(x)A(x)+xS(x)A(x)$ . Thus, $$A(x)=\frac{1}{1-x-2xS(x)}$$ Then if we substitute the formula of $S(x)=\frac{1-x-\sqrt {(1-x)^2-4x}}{2x}$ : $$A(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt {(1-x)^2-4x}}$$ In part b, to analyze the asymptotic of $|L_n|$ , I guess I should find the coeifficient of $[x^n]$ in $A(x)$ where $A(x)=\sum_{n\geq 0} |L_n| x^{2n}$ . However if we solve denominator of $A(x) = 0$ we get \begin{align*} (1-x)^2-4x=0 \quad\Rightarrow\quad x^2-6x+1=0 \end{align*} so, $x=3 \pm 2\sqrt2$ . So the g.f. will be analytic if we delete the intervals $(3+\sqrt2, \infty)$ and $(-\infty,3-\sqrt2)$ . Write: $A(x)=\frac{1} {\sqrt{(x- r_1)(x-r_2)}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{x-r_1}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{x-r_2}}= \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x/r_1}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x/r_2}}$ where $r_1=3+\sqrt{8}$ and $r_2=3-\sqrt{8}$ . Then, $A(x)=(\sum_{n\geq 0}  (1/r_1)^n x^n \sum_{n\geq 0} (1/r_2)^n x^n)^{1/2}= \sum_{n\geq 0} \sum_{j=0}^{n} (1/r_1)^j (1/r_3)^{n-j} x^n$ , here I used Caushy formula.

65,Proving interesting identity with partial sums of Pascal's triangle rows,Proving interesting identity with partial sums of Pascal's triangle rows,,"As part of another problem I'm working on, I find myself needing to prove the following: $$\sum_{k=0}^n\binom{2k+1}{k}\binom{m-(2k+1)}{n-k} = \sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{m+1}{k}$$ where $n\leq m$ . I've checked it computationally for all $n\leq m\leq 16$ . A few thoughts: this looks like a binomial convolution, but the $k$ 's show up in the top of the binomial coefficients which disqualifies it from Vandermonde-esque identities I've found. Further, it uses weird binomial coefficients where the top is less than the bottom and the top can be negative - seems strange to me. Some references I've found (for example) have similar looking sums of products, but the $2k$ instead of $k$ seems to hurt. Another (""Some Generalizations of Vandermonde's Convolution"" by H. W.

71,Calculating Minesweeper Odds Is this calculation correct?,Calculating Minesweeper Odds Is this calculation correct?,,"This is a follow-up to the question: Calculating odds of Minesweeper is this correct? I was given good advice & answers pointed out some flaws in my calculation. However editing the original post would make the answers outdated. I've only modified the board slightly, adding another number so that simplifying a section is not possible. I did this because I'd like to ensure my calculation can apply to any board & makes sense in doing so. N = number of mines = 25 T = number of unidentified squares = 123 As you can see I've broken up the board into colored groups based on having identical odds so that It isn't necessary to calculate each square individually. For example, 'A', 'B', 'F' & 'I' are all touching a '3'. There is no reason 'A' would have different odds than 'B' 'F' or 'I'. I will split the squares into 2 sections: Section1 - Left marked section (ABFI, MNO, K...) Section2 - Right marked section (PTV,QRWX,SUY) Seciton3 - All the unknown squares. These are all the blank grey squares Based on the numbers we know that: Section1 + Section2 must have a sum of:  5, 6, 7 or 8 mines. Section3 must have the rest, being:      20, 19, 18, or 17 mines. I'll refer to what we know as 'Rules'. We know the total number of mines surrounding a '1' must equal '1'. Rules: ColorGroups                                # of bombs in ColorGroups -----------                                ---------------------------- (A+B+F+I) + (C) + (G) + (J)       =        3 (D+E+H+L) (C) + (G) + (K)         =        1 (M+N+O) + (J) + (K) + (G)         =        1 (P+T+V) + (RXWQ)                  =        2 (S+U+Y) + (RXWQ)                  =        1 Now, for the left side (Section1), we can get all the solutions by making assumptions. For example, if we assume ABFI = 3 than C, G & J must all be 0 since we have a rule: ABFI + C + G + J = 3. We will do the same for the right side (Section2) afterwards. Assume (C) has 1 bomb. In other words, the 'C' square is a bomb. (C is chosen at random, but I prefer to start with a small section). I'll call the first solution 'S1-01-01': Keep in mind a square can have a 1 or a 0. So (A+B+F+I) could have a max of 4 (ignoring the '3') & (C) can have a max of 1 Solutions (S1-01-01) Grouping   # of bombs --------   ----------- (C)       = 1 (D+E+H+L) = 0 (K)       = 0 (G)       = 0 (J)       = 1 (M+N+O)   = 0 (A+F+I+B) = 1  (S1-01-02) Grouping    # of bombs ----        ---------- (C)       = 1 (D+E+H+L) = 0 (K)       = 0 (G)       = 0 (J)       = 0 (M+N+O)   = 1 (A+F+I+B) = 2 That's all for C = 1, so next we assume G=1: S1-02-01       # of bombs --------        ---------- (C)           = 0 (G)           = 1 (D+E+H+L)     = 0 (K)           = 0 (M+N+O)       = 0 (J)           = 0 (A+F+I+B)     = 2  S1-02-02 -------- (C)       = 0 (G)       = 0 (J)       = 1 (A+F+I+B) = 2 (M+N+O)   = 0 (D+E+H+L) = 1 (K)       = 0  S1-02-03 -------- (C)       = 0 (G)       = 0 (J)       = 0 (K)       = 1 (D+E+H+L) = 0 (A+F+I+B) = 3 (M+N+O)   = 0  S1-02-04 -------- (C)       = 0 (G)       = 0 (J)       = 0 (K)       = 0 (D+E+H+L) = 1 (A+F+I+B) = 3 (M+N+O)   = 1 Doing the same for the right Section: S2-01-01: --------- (R+X+W+Q)    = 1 (S+U+Y)      = 0 (P+T+V)      = 1  S2-02-01: --------- (RXWQ)       = 0 (S+U+Y)      = 1 (P+T+V)      = 2 Now we list the number of bombs in every solution : Section1 #:       S1-11  S1-12  S1-21  S1-12  S1-23  S1-24 -----    -----  -----  -----  -----  -----  ------ ABFI:    1      2      2      2      3      3 C:       1      1      0      0      0      0    DEHL:    0      0      0      1      0      1 G:       0      0      1      0      0      0 J:       1      0      0      1      0      0 K:       0      0      0      0      1      0 MNO:     0      1      0      0      0      1 TOTALS:  3      4      3      4      4      5 Section2 #:       S2-11  S2-21 -----    -----  ----- RXWQ:    1      0 SUY:     0      1 PTV:     1      2 TOTALS:  2      3 Now we calculate the number of cases possible for every solution. This is done by using nCr ( Binomial coefficient ). Where N = Number of Squares and B = numberOfBombs. Combinations = N NCR B. For the first solution (S1-1) these are the cases: (ABFI)    = 4 NCR 1 = 4 (C)       = 1 NCR 1 = 1 (DEHL)    = 4 NCR 0 = 1 (G)       = 1 NCR 0 = 1 (J)       = 1 NCR 1 = 1 (K)       = 0 NCR 1 = 1 (MNO)     = 3 NCR 0 = 1 Multiplying these combinations we get: 4*1*1*1*1*1*1 = 4 cases for this solution (S1-1).

For clarification, here is an example of a complete solution (S1-11+S2-11): ABFI:    1 C:       1 DEHL:    0 G:       0 J:       1 K:       0 MNO:     0 RXWQ:    1 SUY:     0 PTV:     1  TOTAL MINES:    5 TOTAL CASES:    16 Total cases is calculated by multiplying the binomial distribution for each group as we've done before Notice that I've taken the first case for S1 and added the first case for S2. If I were to continue, I'd write the first case for S1 + the second for S2, then the second case for S1 + the first for S2. These 2184 total cases do not hold equal weight . We know that there are 25 mines in the total & 123 unidentified squares. 25/123 = 0.20 mines per square. This means a case with 5 mines (the minimum) will have a different weight than a case with 8 mines (the maximum). Credit to Joriki in this answer for the formula $\binom{t-s}{m-n}\;.$ t = remaining unidentified squares (123) m = remaining mines (25) s = unidentified squares in case n = mines assigned to case Knowing that (Section1+Section) has 25 unidentified squares and may contain 5, 6, 7 or 8 mines we assign the weights: W1 (5 mines): $\binom{123-25}{25-5}\;$ = $\binom{98}{20}\;$ W2 (6 mines): $\binom{123-25}{25-6}\;$ = $\binom{98}{19}\;$ W3 (7 mines): $\binom{123-25}{25-7}\;$ = $\binom{98}{18}\;$ W4 (8 mines): $\binom{123-25}{25-8}\;$ = $\binom{98}{17}\;$ Before we carry on lets put our 2 sections into 1 ""FullSection"". We do this by ""Multiplying"" section2 & section1. By that I mean, for every solution in Section1, add every solution in Section2. Section1 has 6 solutions with total mines of: 3, 4, 3, 4, 4, 5.

E.G: for S1, the number of mines is 6 and there are 36 cases. The green section is 4 squares in length and contains 1 mine so: 0.00072784173 * 36 = 0.02620230228 (1/4) * 0.02620230228 = 0.02620230228 Results: S#   Mine Count  # of cases   weight           (C)          (DEHL)       (K)          (G)          (J)          (MNO)        (AFIB)      (RXWQ)      (SUY)         (PTV) ---  ----------  ----------   -------------    ----------   ----------   ----------   ----------   ----------   ----------   ----------   ----------   ----------   ---------- 1    6           36           0.02620230228    0.02620230   0.00000000   0.00000000   0.00000000   0.02620230   0.00000000   0.00655058   0.00000000   0.00873410   0.01746820 2    6           216          0.15721381368    0.15721381   0.00000000   0.00000000   0.00000000   0.00000000   0.05240460   0.07860691   0.03930345   0.00000000   0.05240460 3    7           576          0.09956874816    0.00000000   0.02489219   0.00000000   0.00000000   0.00000000   0.03318958   0.07467656   0.02489219   0.00000000   0.03318958 4    5           72           0.20699818992    0.00000000   0.00000000   0.00000000   0.20699819   0.00000000   0.00000000   0.10349909   0.05174955   0.00000000   0.06899940 5    7           36           0.00622304676    0.00000000   0.00000000   0.00622305   0.00000000   0.00000000   0.00000000   0.00466729   0.00000000   0.00207435   0.00414870 6    6           48           0.03493640304    0.00000000   0.00000000   0.03493640   0.00000000   0.00000000   0.00000000   0.02620230   0.00873410   0.00000000   0.01164547 7    6           54           0.03930345342    0.00000000   0.00000000   0.00000000   0.03930345   0.00000000   0.00000000   0.01965173   0.00000000   0.01310115   0.02620230 8    5           48           0.13799879328    0.13799879   0.00000000   0.00000000   0.00000000   0.13799879   0.00000000   0.03449970   0.03449970   0.00000000   0.04599960 9    6           288          0.20961841824    0.00000000   0.05240460   0.00000000   0.00000000   0.20961842   0.00000000   0.10480921   0.05240460   0.00000000   0.06987281 10   7           162          0.02800371042    0.02800371   0.00000000   0.00000000   0.00000000   0.00000000   0.00933457   0.01400186   0.00000000   0.00933457   0.01866914 11   7           216          0.03733828056    0.00000000   0.00933457   0.00000000   0.00000000   0.03733828   0.00000000   0.01866914   0.00000000   0.01244609   0.02489219 12   8           432          0.01659478752    0.00000000   0.00414870   0.00000000   0.00000000   0.00000000   0.00553160   0.01244609   0.00000000   0.00553160   0.01106319 Totals:                          0.99999995    0.34941862   0.09078006   0.04115945   0.24630164   0.41115779   0.10046035   0.49828045   0.21158359   0.05122186   0.38455518 Looking at the result table we can see that any blue square (MNO) has the least chances of being a mine and any green square (AFIB) has the greatest chances of having a mine . The results seems reasonable, but is it correct?","This is a follow-up to the question: Calculating odds of Minesweeper is this correct? I was given good advice & answers pointed out some flaws in my calculation. However editing the original post would make the answers outdated. I've only modified the board slightly, adding another number so that simplifying a section is not possible. I did this because I'd like to ensure my calculation can apply to any board & makes sense in doing so. N = number of mines = 25 T = number of unidentified squares = 123 As you can see I've broken up the board into colored groups based on having identical odds so that It isn't necessary to calculate each square individually. For example, 'A', 'B', 'F' & 'I' are all touching a '3'. There is no reason 'A' would have different odds than 'B' 'F' or 'I'. I will split the squares into 2 sections: Section1 - Left marked section (ABFI, MNO, K...) Section2 - Right marked section (PTV,QRWX,SUY) Seciton3 - All the unknown squares. These are all the blank grey squares Based on the numbers we know that: Section1 + Section2 must have a sum of:  5, 6, 7 or 8 mines. Section3 must have the rest, being:      20, 19, 18, or 17 mines. I'll refer to what we know as 'Rules'. We know the total number of mines surrounding a '1' must equal '1'. Rules: ColorGroups                                # of bombs in ColorGroups -----------                                ---------------------------- (A+B+F+I) + (C) + (G) + (J)       =        3 (D+E+H+L) (C) + (G) + (K)         =        1 (M+N+O) + (J) + (K) + (G)         =        1 (P+T+V) + (RXWQ)                  =        2 (S+U+Y) + (RXWQ)                  =        1 Now, for the left side (Section1), we can get all the solutions by making assumptions. For example, if we assume ABFI = 3 than C, G & J must all be 0 since we have a rule: ABFI + C + G + J = 3. We will do the same for the right side (Section2) afterwards. Assume (C) has 1 bomb. In other words, the 'C' square is a bomb. (C is chosen at random, but I prefer to start with a small section). I'll call the first solution 'S1-01-01': Keep in mind a square can have a 1 or a 0. So (A+B+F+I) could have a max of 4 (ignoring the '3') & (C) can have a max of 1 Solutions (S1-01-01) Grouping   # of bombs --------   ----------- (C)       = 1 (D+E+H+L) = 0 (K)       = 0 (G)       = 0 (J)       = 1 (M+N+O)   = 0 (A+F+I+B) = 1  (S1-01-02) Grouping    # of bombs ----        ---------- (C)       = 1 (D+E+H+L) = 0 (K)       = 0 (G)       = 0 (J)       = 0 (M+N+O)   = 1 (A+F+I+B) = 2 That's all for C = 1, so next we assume G=1: S1-02-01       # of bombs --------        ---------- (C)           = 0 (G)           = 1 (D+E+H+L)     = 0 (K)           = 0 (M+N+O)       = 0 (J)           = 0 (A+F+I+B)     = 2  S1-02-02 -------- (C)       = 0 (G)       = 0 (J)       = 1 (A+F+I+B) = 2 (M+N+O)   = 0 (D+E+H+L) = 1 (K)       = 0  S1-02-03 -------- (C)       = 0 (G)       = 0 (J)       = 0 (K)       = 1 (D+E+H+L) = 0 (A+F+I+B) = 3 (M+N+O)   = 0  S1-02-04 -------- (C)       = 0 (G)       = 0 (J)       = 0 (K)       = 0 (D+E+H+L) = 1 (A+F+I+B) = 3 (M+N+O)   = 1 Doing the same for the right Section: S2-01-01: --------- (R+X+W+Q)    = 1 (S+U+Y)      = 0 (P+T+V)      = 1  S2-02-01: --------- (RXWQ)       = 0 (S+U+Y)      = 1 (P+T+V)      = 2 Now we list the number of bombs in every solution : Section1 #:       S1-11  S1-12  S1-21  S1-12  S1-23  S1-24 -----    -----  -----  -----  -----  -----  ------ ABFI:    1      2      2      2      3      3 C:       1      1      0      0      0      0    DEHL:    0      0      0      1      0      1 G:       0      0      1      0      0      0 J:       1      0      0      1      0      0 K:       0      0      0      0      1      0 MNO:     0      1      0      0      0      1 TOTALS:  3      4      3      4      4      5 Section2 #:       S2-11  S2-21 -----    -----  ----- RXWQ:    1      0 SUY:     0      1 PTV:     1      2 TOTALS:  2      3 Now we calculate the number of cases possible for every solution. This is done by using nCr ( Binomial coefficient ). Where N = Number of Squares and B = numberOfBombs. Combinations = N NCR B. For the first solution (S1-1) these are the cases: (ABFI)    = 4 NCR 1 = 4 (C)       = 1 NCR 1 = 1 (DEHL)    = 4 NCR 0 = 1 (G)       = 1 NCR 0 = 1 (J)       = 1 NCR 1 = 1 (K)       = 0 NCR 1 = 1 (MNO)     = 3 NCR 0 = 1 Multiplying these combinations we get: 4*1*1*1*1*1*1 = 4 cases for this solution (S1-1). Doing the same for all solutions in the left section we get: #:      S1-11 S1-12 S1-21 S1-22 S1-23 S1-24 ABFI:   4     6     6     6     4     4 C:      1     1     1     1     1     1    DEHL:   1     1     1     4     1     4 G:      1     1     1     1     1     1 J:      1     1     1     1     1     1 K:      1     1     1     1     1     1 MNO:    1     3     1     1     1     3 TOTALS: 4     18    6     24    4     48  Total cases = 104 Note: In the above table, to get 'TOTALS' we multiply all combinations to get the total combinations for that solution. Now for the right section: #:      S2-11  S2-21 RXWQ:   4      1 SUY:    1      3 PTV:    3      3 TOTALS: 12     9  Total cases = 21 To get the total cases we need to multiply these: 21 * 104 = 2184 total cases. For clarification, here is an example of a complete solution (S1-11+S2-11): ABFI:    1 C:       1 DEHL:    0 G:       0 J:       1 K:       0 MNO:     0 RXWQ:    1 SUY:     0 PTV:     1  TOTAL MINES:    5 TOTAL CASES:    16 Total cases is calculated by multiplying the binomial distribution for each group as we've done before Notice that I've taken the first case for S1 and added the first case for S2. If I were to continue, I'd write the first case for S1 + the second for S2, then the second case for S1 + the first for S2. These 2184 total cases do not hold equal weight . We know that there are 25 mines in the total & 123 unidentified squares. 25/123 = 0.20 mines per square. This means a case with 5 mines (the minimum) will have a different weight than a case with 8 mines (the maximum). Credit to Joriki in this answer for the formula t = remaining unidentified squares (123) m = remaining mines (25) s = unidentified squares in case n = mines assigned to case Knowing that (Section1+Section) has 25 unidentified squares and may contain 5, 6, 7 or 8 mines we assign the weights: W1 (5 mines): = W2 (6 mines): = W3 (7 mines): = W4 (8 mines): = Before we carry on lets put our 2 sections into 1 ""FullSection"". We do this by ""Multiplying"" section2 & section1. By that I mean, for every solution in Section1, add every solution in Section2. Section1 has 6 solutions with total mines of: 3, 4, 3, 4, 4, 5.

The knight can reach the other corner or any square for that matter.

If the knight starts on a black square(1A), the other corner would also be black(8H). A knight reaches a square of the initial color after every even number of moves. 63 is an odd number, hence we've reached a contradiction. So, it is not possible. Is my reasoning correct?

The way I tried to solve it is by using the fact that $$|A \cup B|=|A|+|B|-|A\cap B|$$ Where $|A|$ is the amount of possible functions such that $f(1)\ne 1$ and $|B|$ is the amount of possible functions such that $f(2)\ne 2$.
