34,Elementary proof that $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}{\frac{1}{m^{k^2}}}$ is irrational (for any integer $m > 1$),Elementary proof that  is irrational (for any integer ),\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}{\frac{1}{m^{k^2}}} m > 1,"I used similar technique as Fourier's proof of irrationality of $e$ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_that_e_is_irrational to show that this series is indeed an irrational number but I was wondering if there are other elementary proofs, specially techniques related to polynomials with rational coefficients. Any hint, complete proof, reference, etc. is much appreciated. EDIT : presenting my proof as @AndréNicolas requested : I just followed the same steps; let's assume the series is $s$. Now choose $k_0$ such that $m^{k_0^2} > q$. Define $x = q m^{k_0^2} \left(s - \sum_{k=1}^{k_0}{\frac{1}{m^{k^2}}} \right)$. Now if $s$ is not irrational then $s=\frac{p}{q}$ for some non-negative $p$ and $q$. Then it is easy to check that $x$ is an integer. Now we need to reach to a contradiction by proving that $x < 1$.  After simple manipulations, $x = q m^{k_0^2} \sum_{k=k_0+1}^{k_0}{\frac{1}{m^{k^2}}}$ Now, for $k=k_0+1,k_0+2, \ldots$, we have $k^2 > k+k_0^2$ so $$ q m^{k_0^2} \sum_{k=k_0+1}^{k_0}{\frac{1}{m^{k^2}}} < q m^{k_0^2} \sum_{k=k_0+1}^{k_0}{\frac{1}{m^{k+k_0^2}}} = \frac{q}{m^{k_0^2+1}}\frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{m}}=\frac{1}{m-1}$$ which follows from our assumption about $q$ and $k_0$.","I used similar technique as Fourier's proof of irrationality of $e$ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_that_e_is_irrational to show that this series is indeed an irrational number but I was wondering if there are other elementary proofs, specially techniques related to polynomials with rational coefficients. Any hint, complete proof, reference, etc. is much appreciated. EDIT : presenting my proof as @AndréNicolas requested : I just followed the same steps; let's assume the series is $s$. Now choose $k_0$ such that $m^{k_0^2} > q$. Define $x = q m^{k_0^2} \left(s - \sum_{k=1}^{k_0}{\frac{1}{m^{k^2}}} \right)$.

Well here's my confusion (and question): why not just prove that (in the first case) $$ |a_n +b_n -(a+b)| <2 \epsilon $$ and this would imply that of course for some other $n$ it is less than $\epsilon$. And the same with other proofs. In short: why, if we are allowed to play around with discrepancies from the limit of other sequences, we absolutely must show that the desired one is strictly less than $\epsilon$ away?",,"['real-analysis', 'sequences-and-series']"

I took the 5th term of the sequence and reciprocated everything to get a 1 2 3 4 5 6 pattern in the manner shown by the arrows. It repeats itself at the dotted edge with the dotted edge being common to the two recurring units. Here's the INCORRECT image attached. edit : I am very sorry for switching 11 and 12.

How is this space calculated? The edge on the right of the first circle is projected onto the base at a point at distance $x+r$ from the vertex on the left, and the same is done for the edge on the right of the last circle, at distance $x+r$ from the vertex on the right of the base; the space sought is therefore $a-2(x+r)$ , and must be filled exactly by $n-2$ circles of radius $r$ , from which $(n-2)(2r)=a-2(x+r)$ . Of course, not for every radius $r$ we have the desired set of circles, only for the $r$ for which the relation $(n-2)(2r)=a-2(x+r)$ is verified by a natural $n$ . In an angle of $\pi/3$ radians consider a circle of radius $r$ tangent to both sides (therefore with its centre on the bisector); let $x$ be the distance of the point of tangency from the vertex of the angle; then we have $r/x=\tan\pi/6=1/\sqrt3$ , therefore $x=r\sqrt3$ . If we consider the two circles at the extremity of the base of the triangle, there must be $n-2$ circles of radius $r$ between them, from which the relation $(n-2)(2r)=a-2(x+r)$ , where $a$ is the side of the equilateral triangle (in our case $a=1$ , but let $a$ be left). Therefore we have $$(n-2)2r=a-2r\,(\sqrt3+1)\iff r=\frac a{2(n+\sqrt3-1)}.$$ Each circle has area $\pi\,r^2=\pi a^2/(4(n+\sqrt3-1)^2)$ and there are $1+2+\dots+n=n(n+1)/2$ circles, so the total area of the circles is $$a_n=\frac{\pi\,n(n+1)}{8(n+\sqrt3-1)^2}\,a^2$$ as given in the problem.

Especially the comment of @Martin Hopf showed that this problem is a ""classic"" and by no means new. Here is Eric Weissten's article on "" squareful (nice term!) numbers"" https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Squareful.html from which you can find the topic exposed. This article https://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.3829.pdf is an exhaustive study of the problem. Original post Consider the subset of the natural numbers $n\ge 1$ which have at least one square prime factor. These can be formally defined by $\mu (n) = 0$ , where $\mu$ is the Möbius function. The first 40 of these are $$s_{0}=\{4,8,9,12,16,18,20,24,25,27,28,32,36,40,44,45,48,49,50,52,54,56,60,63,64,68,72,75,76,80,81,84,88,90,92,96,98,99,100,104\}$$ Closer inspection of $s_{0}$ shows that there are sequences of consecutive such numbers. We call them compact sequences . If sorted by the length $m$ of the compact sequence we find in $s_{0}$ the following $$m=2: \{8,9\}, \{24,25\}, \{27,28\},\{44,45\},\{48,49\},\{49,50\},\{63,64\},\{75,76\},\{80,81\},\{98,99\},\{99,100\}$$ $$m=3:  \{48,49,50\}, \{98,99,100\}$$ We see that for a given length $m$ there is more than one sequence, and that for the given length 40 of $s_{0}$ there are no sequences with length $m\gt3$ . Prolonging the list $s_0$ we find also longer compact sequences, and, again, for a given length there is more than one sequence. Quoting only the first member of the first appearance of the corresponding sequence I found numerically in the format $\{m,\text{first term of first appearance}\}$ $$c=\left( \begin{array}{cc}  2 & 8 \\  3 & 48 \\  4 & 242 \\  5 & 844 \\  6 & 22'020 \\  7 & 217'070 \\  8 & 1'092'747 \\  9 & 8'870'024 \\ 10 & 221'167'422\\ \end{array} \right)$$ Remark: this sequence is contained in OEIS ( https://oeis.org/A045882 ).
