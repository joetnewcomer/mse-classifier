11,Trouble understanding Blagouchine's extensions to the Malmsten integral,Trouble understanding Blagouchine's extensions to the Malmsten integral,,"$\newcommand{\d}{\,\mathrm{d}}$ The great work of Blagouchine massively generalises the Malmsten integral. I am actually familiar with contour integration, but he consistently introduces results from other papers that I am unfamiliar with, so it feels disingenuous to take notes on a proof I can't understand. I am interested in arriving at the following in a more ""simple"" manner: Let $a\ge0$ be real. Then: $$J(a)=\int_0^\infty\frac{\ln(x^2+a^2)}{\cosh(x)}\d x=2\pi\ln\left(\frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{3}{4}+\frac{a}{2\pi}\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{4}+\frac{a}{2\pi}\right)}\right)+\pi\ln2\pi$$ As I mentioned, his derivation is not one that I am particularly keen to follow, but the similarity between this integral and Malmsten's integral made me hopeful one could be derived from the other. Malmsten's Integral: If $-\pi\lt\varphi\lt\pi$ , then: $$I(\varphi)=\int_1^\infty\frac{\ln(\ln(x))}{x^2+2\cdot\cos(\varphi)x+1}\d x=\frac{\pi}{2}\csc(\varphi)\ln\left((2\pi)^{\varphi/\pi}\frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{\varphi}{2\pi}\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\varphi}{2\pi}\right)}\right)$$ This I have seen a good proof of and am satisfied with. Sadly I did not get very far with tackling $J$ : $$J(a)=2\int_0^\infty\frac{\ln(x^2+a^2)}{e^x+e^{-x}}\d x$$ Which under the transformation $x\mapsto e^x$ becomes: $$J(a)=2\int_1^\infty\frac{\ln(\ln^2(x)+a^2)}{x^2+1}\d x$$ Which is almost equal to $2\cdot I\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)$ . We want the term inside the logarithm to be simply $\ln(x)$ . For clarity, introduce $t$ a dummy variable. For $\ln^2(x)+a^2=\ln(t)$ , one gets $t=e^{a^2}x^{\ln(x)}$ , and $\d t=2e^{a^2}x^{\ln(x)}\frac{\ln(x)}{x}\d x$ , and an expression for $x$ in terms of $t$ too ugly to type. I do not see how to go any further. I also do not see how to reverse engineer Blagouchine's closed form into an expression involving $I$ and $a$ . It is similar to $I(\pi/2 + a)$ , but not close enough. Must I resign myself to researching his contour integration, or can this be done using Malmsten's integral as a first principle? If it can be done, I am not expecting the full proof, just an indication.

I'll express those at the end, though, since they tie more intimately into my proof. Attempted Proof: Let the following be: Let $\g_\a := \set{\a_i}_{i=0}^m$ be an increasing partition of $[a,b]$ . (This is the set of discontinuities of $\vp$ , i.e. $\vp$ is constant on $(\a_{i-1},\a_i)$ $\forall i$ .) Let the definitions in the problem statement hold. Let $\ve > 0$ . Let $\ds \delta := \min_{1 \le i \le m} \left| \a_i - \a_{i-1} \right|$ . Let $\g := \set{x_i}_{i=0}^n$ be an increasing partition of $[a,b]$ with $\norm \g < \delta$ . Let $\ol \g := \g \cup \g_\a$ , and let it be written $\ol \g := \set{\ol{x_i}}_{i=0}^p$ . Let $\ol{\xi_i} \in [\ol{x_i}, \ol{x_{i-1}}]$ for each $i$ . (These are our representative valuation points in the definition of the integral.) By the merit of $\ol \g$ being a refinement of $\g$ , and by merit of definition, we have $$ \norm{ \ol \g } \le \norm \g < \delta \le \norm{\g_\a} $$ By the Cauchy criterion for Riemann-Stieljes integration, then, where $R_\g$ denotes the usual Riemann-Stieltjes sum, $$ \abs{ R_\g - R_{\ol \g} } < \ve $$ and so $R_{\ol \g}$ equals the desired integral. It remains to see if this equals the desired sum. Write $$ R_{\og} = \sum_{j=1}^p f \para{ \ol{ \xi_j } } \Big( \vp \para{ \ol{x_j} } - \vp \para{ \ol{x_{j-1}} } \Big) $$ From definition, we may have either $\ol{x_i} = \alpha_j \in \g_\a$ for some $i$ (i.e. is a discontinuity of $\vp$ ), or $\ol{x_i} = x_i \in \g$ for some $i$ . Note that for any consecutive pairing $\ol{x_{i-1}},\ol{x_{i}}$ that not both are in $\g_\a$ . (This is because each are in $\og$ for which $\norm \og < \delta$ , and thus the smallest distance between any two discontinuities of $\vp$ is bigger than the distance between any two members of $\og$ .) Thus, we only have three cases to consider, based on how many of a given pair are, indeed, discontinuities: Case 1 (neither): In the case neither $\ol{x_{i-1}},\ol{x_{i}}$ are discontinuities of $\vp$ , then trivially we will have $$ \vp \para{ \ol{x_j} } - \vp \para{ \ol{x_{j-1}} } = 0 $$ Case 2 (right discontinuity): Suppose $\ol{x_{i}} = \a_j$ for some $j$ (but, again, that means $\ol{x_{i-1}}$ is not a discontinuity). Then in such a case, using the piecewise continuity and constantness of $\vp$ , $$ \vp \para{ \ol{x_j} } - \vp \para{ \ol{x_{j-1}} } = \vp\para{ \a_j } - \vp \para{ \a_{j}^- } $$ Case 3 (left discontinuity): Similar to the previous, we have $\ol{x_{i-1}} = \a_j$ for some $j$ , and take $$ \vp \para{ \ol{x_j} } - \vp \para{ \ol{x_{j-1}} } = \vp\para{ \a_j^+ } - \vp \para{ \a_{j} } $$ Let $\ol{\xi_{i,j}}$ be the $\ol{\xi_i}$ whose terms are not eliminated by merit of Case 1 but lie in Case 2; similarly, $\ol{\xi'_{i,j}}$ for those whose terms lie in Case 3. Then we have, once the terms have negated, $$ R_{\og} = \underbrace{\sum_{j=1}^m f \para{ \ol{\xi_{i,j}} } \Big( \vp\para{ \a_j } - \vp \para{ \a_{j}^- } \Big) }_{\text{case 2 terms}} + \underbrace{\sum_{j=1}^m f \para{ \ol{\xi'_{i,j}} } \Big( \vp\para{ \a_j^+ } - \vp \para{ \a_{j} } \Big)}_{\text{case 3 terms}} $$ Note that, for the Case 2 terms, each $\ol{\xi_{i,j}}$ is within $\delta$ of $\a_j$ ; specifically, $\ol{\xi_{i,j}} \in (\a_j - \delta,\a_j)$ . Likewise, $\ol{\xi'_{i,j}} \in (\a_j,\a_j+\delta)$ . Since $f$ is continuous, we may take each to be its corresponding $\a_j$ , and write $$ R_{\og} = \sum_{j=1}^m f \para{ \a_j } \Big( \vp\para{ \a_j } - \vp \para{ \a_{j}^- } \Big)  +\sum_{j=1}^m f \para{ \a_j } \Big( \vp\para{ \a_j^+ } - \vp \para{ \a_{j} } \Big) $$ Some clear cancellation results, giving $$ R_{\og} = \sum_{j=1}^m f \para{ \a_j } \Big( \vp\para{ \a_j^+ } - \vp \para{ \a_{j}^- } \Big)  $$ Taking the usual convention for what occurs for the $\a_j$ which are $a,b$ , we see the $\vp$ difference here is indeed $d_i$ . So we see $$ \int_a^b f \, \dd \vp  = R_{\og} = \sum_{j=1}^m f \para{ \a_j } d_i $$ as desired. My Questions / Issues: While I feel like this proof is on the right path, I have some anxieties about some steps. Some in particular I feel aren't quite ""there"" yet. I was wondering if anyone would be able to help me flesh these ideas uot. The use of the Cauchy criterion for Riemann-Stieltjes integrals (stated here) feels far too un-fleshed out, and I doubt it actually lets me conclude that $R_\og$ equals the integral in question. I imagine it only lets me conclude the integral exists at best. I do see that this proof seems to use something similar towards the end of their proof, but their motivation, choice of bound, and the weird $\delta$ 's all escape me. The second chunk of the proof (verifying the alternate form for $R_\og$ ) feels right, but is there any issue there? Something feels sketchy about how I waited until then to define the $\ol{\xi_{i,j}}$ terms to be $\a_j$ in particular, but I don't see how it would be problematic either... I feel like I barely used the continuity of $f$ at all, which means its purpose is lurking elsewhere. Where would that be?

It remains to see if this equals the desired sum. Write From definition, we may have either for some (i.e. is a discontinuity of ), or for some . Note that for any consecutive pairing that not both are in . (This is because each are in for which , and thus the smallest distance between any two discontinuities of is bigger than the distance between any two members of .) Thus, we only have three cases to consider, based on how many of a given pair are, indeed, discontinuities: Case 1 (neither): In the case neither are discontinuities of , then trivially we will have Case 2 (right discontinuity): Suppose for some (but, again, that means is not a discontinuity). Then in such a case, using the piecewise continuity and constantness of , Case 3 (left discontinuity): Similar to the previous, we have for some , and take Let be the whose terms are not eliminated by merit of Case 1 but lie in Case 2; similarly, for those whose terms lie in Case 3. Then we have, once the terms have negated, Note that, for the Case 2 terms, each is within of ; specifically, . Likewise, . Since is continuous, we may take each to be its corresponding , and write Some clear cancellation results, giving Taking the usual convention for what occurs for the which are , we see the difference here is indeed . So we see as desired. My Questions / Issues: While I feel like this proof is on the right path, I have some anxieties about some steps. Some in particular I feel aren't quite ""there"" yet. I was wondering if anyone would be able to help me flesh these ideas uot. The use of the Cauchy criterion for Riemann-Stieltjes integrals (stated here) feels far too un-fleshed out, and I doubt it actually lets me conclude that equals the integral in question. I imagine it only lets me conclude the integral exists at best. I do see that this proof seems to use something similar towards the end of their proof, but their motivation, choice of bound, and the weird 's all escape me. The second chunk of the proof (verifying the alternate form for ) feels right, but is there any issue there? Something feels sketchy about how I waited until then to define the terms to be in particular, but I don't see how it would be problematic either... I feel like I barely used the continuity of at all, which means its purpose is lurking elsewhere. Where would that be? Thanks for the insights and thoughts you guys can give!","

(I need to find the volume of that figure.) The image shows a curve which does not have a volume but to understand what volume the problem is asking I imagine as if on the inside it is filled with some material My problem is that all I have seen on the Internet about this problem involves multivariable calculus, parametrization, polar coordinates, etc. I have not seen any of these yet, so I have to do this problem with integrals in only one variable. The formulas we have seen in class about the applications of the Riemann Integral are the following: Arc length L of a curve $$L= \int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{1+(f’(x))^2} dx$$ Volume $$V_1=\int_{a}^{b} \pi (f(x)^2 dx$$ $$V_2=\int_{a}^{b} A(x)dx$$ A(x) is the area of a section of the figure Lateral area $$\int_{a}^{b}2\pi f(x) \sqrt{1+f’(x)}dx$$ I thought on expressing the sphere equation and the cylinder equation in terms of the same variable and integrating.

I can’t really see what the base of a figure like that would be, since it’s a curve-like figure, how would you visualize that? If you meant the base of the figure, then I understand that studying it is necessary in order to compute the volume but at what point that computation was used? What is exactly b(x) and why is it important? Regarding the height, A(x) is the integral of a function, which is the height taking x as a parameter and y as a variable but, the graph of the function is in the first quadrant, so, doesn’t this mean that we are actually integrating height/2?

The instructor was proving directly that if a vector field is path-independent, then it must be conservative (i.e. is a gradient of a potential function.) The proof (or sketch thereof) the student had in their notebook seemed to proceed as follows: Since the vector field $\mathbf{F}(x,y,z)=(M(x,y,z),N(x,y,z),P(x,y,z))$ is path-independent, we can construct a well-defined function, $$f(x,y,z) := \int_{(a,b,c)}^{(x,y,z)}\mathbf{F}\cdot d\mathbf{s},$$ where $(a,b,c)$ is some fixed point in the domain of $\mathbf{F}$, and the line-integral above should be interpreted as beginning at $(a,b,c)$ and ending at $(x,y,z)$. Our goal is to show that $\nabla f(x,y,z) = \mathbf{F}(x,y,z)$. Since the definition of $f$ is path-independent, we cleverly construct the following curves, joining $(a,b,c)$ to $(x,y,z)$: $$\mathbf{c}_1(t) = (t,b,c), \quad \text{for }a\leq t \leq x$$ $$\mathbf{c}_2(t) = (x,t,c), \quad \text{for }b\leq t \leq y$$ $$\mathbf{c}_3(t) = (x,y,t), \quad \text{for }c\leq t \leq z$$ Since $\mathbf{c}_i'(t)= \mathbf{e}_i$, then $f$ takes the form: $$f(x,y,z) = \int_{a}^{x}M(t,b,c)\,dt + \int_{b}^{y}N(x,t,c)\,dt + \int_{c}^{z}P(x,y,t)\,dt$$ It's at this point that the student's note start to breakdown, and I am having some trouble reconciling the rest of this proof. The issue I immediately see is that if you try and compute $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}f(x,y,z)$ directly, you get the following, $$\partial_x f(x,y,z) = M(x,b,c) + \int_{b}^{y}\frac{\partial N}{\partial x}(x,t,c)\,dt + \int_{c}^{z}\frac{\partial P}{\partial x}(x,y,t)\,dt,$$ after applying the FTC to the first integral and differentiating under the integral on the other two. Ideally, we should have found that $\partial_x f(x,y,z) = M(x,y,z)$, but I do not see how this follows from the above computation. Similarly, we run into issues when we try computing $\partial_y f$. Computing $\partial_z f$, on the other hand, is straightforward since the only place $z$ occurs in $f(x,y,z)$ is on the last integral; therfore $\partial_z f = P$ directly by the FTC.

I started by graphing the basic $\mbox{floor}(x)$ function (I personally use desmos.com for a nice online graphing calculator), then I plotted $y=x$. I then, I noticed that the line of best fit for the $\mbox{floor}$ function was $x-(1/2)$, or $x-0.5$. So, I decided to integrate that result with respect to $x$. So, I ended with $(x^2 -x)/2$. I have tested this out several times, and so far the numbers are accurate. In summary: $\mbox{floor}(x)$ has trendline $x-0.5$. Take the antiderivative of the trendline -> $(x^2 -x)/2$. Then find the area under the steps. I personally took it analytically by looking at graphs and manually computing the area underneath the steps.

I re-wrote it as: $\displaystyle \int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{2x^2-1}{x^4+1}\,dx$. I am considering of integrating on a semicircle contour with center at the origin. I considered the function $\displaystyle f(z)=\frac{2z^2-1}{z^4+1}$  which has $4$ simple poles but only two of them lie on the upper half plane and included in the contour which are: $\displaystyle z_1=\frac{1+i}{\sqrt{2}}, \;\; z_2=\frac{-1+i}{\sqrt{2}}$. The residue at $\displaystyle z_1$ equals $\displaystyle \mathfrak{Res}\left ( f; z_1 \right )=-\frac{2i-1}{2\sqrt{2}}$  while the residue at $z_2$ equals $\displaystyle -2\sqrt{2}i-2\sqrt{2}$. (if I have done the calculations right) Now, I don't know how to continue. Should I find the residues at the other poles as well and the say $\displaystyle \oint_{C}f(z)=2\pi i \sum res$ where $C$ is the semicircle contour and then expand it? That is: $$\oint_{C}f(z)\,dz=\int_{0}^{a} + \int_{{\rm arc}}$$ Then let $a \to +\infty$ then than arc integral would go to zero. But I don't know how to proceed. I had dealt with this integral with residues converting it into a minus infinity to infinity integral  but with contours I am having a bit of problem. Therefore I'd like some help.","I want to evaluate the integral: $$\int_{-\infty}^{0}\frac{2x^2-1}{x^4+1}\,dx$$ using contour integration.
