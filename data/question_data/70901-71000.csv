0,Lowenheim-Skolem number for satisfaction via continuous function rings,Lowenheim-Skolem number for satisfaction via continuous function rings,,"EDIT: now asked at MO . For $\mathcal{X}$ a topological space, let $C(\mathcal{X})$ be the ring of continuous functions $\mathcal{X}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ . For a first-order sentence $\varphi$ in the language of rings, write $\mathcal{X}\models_{C}\varphi$ iff $C(\mathcal{X})\models\varphi$ in the usual sense. Say that $\varphi$ is C -satisfiable iff $\mathcal{X}\models_C\varphi$ for some topological space $\mathcal{X}$ . I'm generally curious about analogues of classical model-theoretic questions in this context. For example: What is the least cardinal $\kappa$ such that, if $\varphi$ is $C$ -satisfiable, then $\mathcal{X}\models_C\varphi$ for some space $\mathcal{X}$ with cardinality $<\kappa$ ? The obvious Lowenheim-Skolem argument doesn't help much here. Roughly speaking, given $\mathcal{X}\models_C\varphi$ we can form a ""small"" elementary substructure $(\mathcal{Y}, R)$ in the usual first-order sense of (an appropriate version of) the pair $(\mathcal{X},C(\mathcal{X}))$ . However, in general we might have $R\subsetneq C(\mathcal{Y})$ (this is similar to the distinction between Henkin and standard semantics for second-order logic). (Of course number of points isn't the only cardinal invariant for which we could ask a Lowenheim-Skolem flavored question, but it seems the simplest to start with. Another natural thing to do would be to restrict attention to a ""nice"" class of spaces, e.g. the compact Hausdorff spaces , but again this seems like a better first step.) One issue here is that I don't know an abstract characterization of which rings are isomorphic to some $C(\mathcal{X})$ . Obviously any such ring $R$ must be the underlying ring of a commutative associative unital $\mathbb{R}$ -algebra, but beyond that I don't see anything. I recall seeing a very snappy theorem addressing this, but I can't find it at the moment (I think it was more complicated than just ""any commutative associative unital $\mathbb{R}$ -algebra's underlying ring,"" but I'm not certain). My broader interest incidentally is in what happens if we replace $\mathbb{R}$ with some other topological structure (= first-order structure + topology such that all functions are continuous and all relations are closed, as subsets of the appropriate product space) . Given a topological structure $\mathcal{A}$ and a topological space $\mathcal{X}$ we can always turn the set of continuous maps from $\mathcal{X}$ to $\mathcal{A}$ into a structure of the same type as $\mathcal{A}$ by defining everything ""pointwise."" So for each topological structure $\mathcal{A}$ we get an analogue $\models_C^\mathcal{A}$ of the relation $\models_C$ above. Ultimately my interest is in developing a connection between ""coarse"" model-theoretic properties (e.g. variants of the Lowenheim-Skolem number) of $\models_C^\mathcal{A}$ and topological algebraic properties of $\mathcal{A}$ . While this question specifically asks about $\mathcal{A}=\mathbb{R}$ , if anyone has information about a different (""nontrivial"") $\mathcal{A}$ or class of $\mathcal{A}$ s I'd be very interested.","EDIT: now asked at MO .

Let $Y$ be compact. Let $x \in X$ . If $N$ is an open set in $X \times Y$ such that $x \times Y \subset N$ , then there is an open set $W$ in $X$ such that $x \in W$ and $W \times Y \subset N$ . This is Lemma 26.8 in Topology by James R. Munkres, 2nd edition. I think I'm clear about it and its proof. Now how (to use the above result ) to derive the following? Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces. Let $A$ and $B$ be subspaces of $X$ and $Y$ , respectively; let $N$ be an open set in $X \times Y$ such that $A \times B \subset N$ . Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are compact. Then there exist open sets $U$ and $V$ in $X$ and $Y$ , respectively such that $$A \times B \subset U \times V \subset N.$$ My effort: (Based upon the valuable feedback from @GregoryGrant. ) Fix an $a \in A$ . Then, for each $b \in B$ , there exists an open set $U_{a, b}$ in $X$ and there exists an open set $V_{a,b}$ in $Y$ such that $$a \times b \in U_{a, b} \times V_{a, b} \subset N. \tag{0} $$ In this way, we obtain a covering $\left\{ \ V_{a, b} \ \colon\  b \in B\  \right\}$ of $B$ by sets open in $Y$ . Since $B$ is compact, there are finitely many of these sets, say, $V_{a, b_1}, \ldots, V_{a, b_n}$ such that $$B \subset \bigcup_{j=1}^n V_{a, b_j}. \tag{1} $$ Let us put $$V_a \colon= \bigcup_{j=1}^n V_{a, b_j} \tag{2} $$ and $$U_a \colon= \bigcap_{j=1}^n U_{a, b_j}. \tag{3} $$ Then $U_a$ is open in $X$ , $V_a$ is open in $Y$ , $a \in U_a$ , and $B \subset V_a$ . Hence $$ a \times B \subset U_a \times V_a. \tag{4} $$ Moreover, if $x \times y \in U_a \times V_a$ , then $x \in U_a$ and $y \in V_a$ ; so $x \in U_{a, b_j}$ for each $j = 1, \ldots, n$ [Refer to (3) above.] and $y \in V_{a, b_k}$ for some $k = 1, \ldots, n$ [Refer to (2) above.]; thus $x \times y \in U_{a, b_k} \times V_{a, b_k}$ . But by virtue of (0) above $$U_{a, b_k} \times V_{a, b_k} \subset N.$$ So $x \times y \in N$ . Hence we have shown that $$ U_a \times V_a \subset N. \tag{5} $$ Therefore, by (4) and (5) we can conclude that, for each element $a \in A$ , we have a basis element $U_a \times V_a$ for the product topology on $X \times Y$ such that $$a \times B \subset U_a \times V_a \subset N. \tag{6} $$ Now $\left\{\ U_a \ \colon \ a \in A \  \right\}$ is a covering of $A$ by sets open in $X$ ; so there are finitely many of them to cover $A$ ; that is, there are finitely many sets, say, $U_{a_1}, \ldots, U_{a_m}$ open in $X$ such that $$A \subset \bigcup_{i=1}^m U_{a_i}. \tag{7} $$ Let's take $$U \colon= \bigcup_{i-1}^m U_{a_i} \tag{8} $$ and $$V \colon= \bigcap_{i=1}^m V_{a_i}. \tag{9} $$ Then the set $U$ is open in $X$ and the set $V$ is open in $Y$ . Now we show that $U \times V \subset N$ . Let $x \times y \in U \times V$ . Then $x \in U$ and $y \in V$ . So $x \in U_{a_r}$ for some $r = 1, \ldots, m$ [Refer to (8) above.] and $y \in V_{a_i}$ for each $i = 1, \ldots, m$ [Refer to (9) above.]. Thus, $x \times y \in U_{a_r} \times V_{a_r}$ . But by virtue of (6) above $$ U_{a_r} \times V_{a_r} \subset N. $$ So $x \times y \in N$ , showing that $U \times V \subset N$ . Now we show that $A \times B \subset U \times V$ . If $a \times b \in A \times B$ , then $a \in A$ and $b \in B$ .

Now $\{U_a \colon a \in A \}$ is a covering of $A$ by sets open in $X$ . So there are finitely many points $a_1, \ldots, a_m$ such that $$A \subset \cup_{i=1}^m U_{a_i}.$$ Similarly, $\{V_b \colon b \in B \}$ is a covering of $B$ by sets open in $Y$ , and since $B$ is compact, therefore there are finitely many points $b_1, \ldots, b_n$ such that $$B \subset \cup_{j=1}^n V_{b_j}.$$ Can we take $$U \colon= \cup_{i=1}^m U_{a_i} \ \ \ \mbox{ and } \ \ \ V \colon= \cup_{j=1}^n V_{b_j}?$$","The tube lemma is as follows: Let and be topological spaces.

I believe the following conjecture is true, but I don't know how to prove it for arbitrary $n$: Conjecture: For any $y\in\mathbb R_+^{n+1}$, there exists a point $x\in\Delta^n$ such that $f(x)=ay$ for some scalar $a\in\mathbb R_+$. Geometrically, every ray from the origin lying in $\mathbb R_+^{n+1}$ must intersect the surface $S = f(\Delta^n)$. Here are some examples with $n=1,y=(1,1)$ and $n=2,y=(1,1,1)$ respectively: These examples suggest that when $y\in\operatorname{int}\mathbb R_+^{n+1}$, the boundary $\partial S=f(\partial\Delta^n)$ ""surrounds"" the line $\{ay:a\in\mathbb R\}$, so the surface $S$ must intersect the line. Thus I feel the conjecture is essentially topological in nature and should have a natural proof based on something like homotopy theory. Unfortunately, I don't know any homotopy theory.",,['general-topology']
