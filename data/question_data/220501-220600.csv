Let $A := k[x,y]/(x^2 - y^3)$, the cuspidal curve. Obviously this isn't etale or smooth over $k$ so its cotangent complex is not contractible. Now, I wish to compute $\mathbb{L}_{A/k}$. So first we have maps $k \rightarrow k[x,y] \rightarrow A$ which induces the transitivity sequence $$\mathbb{L}_{k[x,y]/k} \otimes_{k[x,y]} A \rightarrow \mathbb{L}_{A/k} \rightarrow \mathbb{L}_{A/k[x,y]}.$$ By Iyengar's notes ( http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0609151.pdf ) we know that: $\mathbb{L}_{A/k[x,y]} \simeq \Sigma A$ $\mathbb{L}_{k[x,y]/k} \simeq \Omega_{k[x,y]/k}$ Hence am I right to conclude that Andre-Quillen homology is just $\Omega_{k[x,y]/k} \otimes_{k[x,y]} A$ in degree $0$ and $A$ in degree 1?

How does this come from the definition of $f$ being regular on $U$? The definition (at least the one given in Hartshorne 1.3 ) is: Definition: Let $Y$ be an open subset of an affine variety.

I know that the complex dimension is $3g-3$, and so it is locally isomorphic to the vector space $\mathbb C^{3g-3}$. But is it globally $\mathbb A_{\mathbb C}^{3g-3}$? I can't find a reference that answers this. UPDATE #1: Genus $g=1$ is not in the range of my question, but I was trying to use it for intuition nevertheless.  One of way of computing the moduli space of smooth elliptic curves gives me $\mathbb A^1_{\mathbb C}$ as the moduli space (i.e. using the $j$-invariant) and another way gives me $\mathbb{CP}^1\backslash\{0,1,\infty\}$ (by studying $2:1$ covers of $\mathbb{CP}^1$ branched over $4$ pairwise-distinct points).  Both are one-dimensional and noncompact, but which is the better candidate for the moduli space?  I know that the issue of moduli of elliptic curves is quite a subtle one, and the real answer lies in the world of stacks, but if your only two options were $\mathbb A^1_{\mathbb C}$ and $\mathbb{CP}^1\backslash\{0,1,\infty\}$, which would you choose?  (""Neither"" is not allowed!)  Does the $j$-invariant simply give deformations around some particular elliptic curve of one's choice, and hence makes the former space into the tangent space to the moduli space, while the latter space is the ""actual"" moduli space (in some sense)? UPDATE #2: It occurred to me that the $0$ and $1$ that are being omitted from the projective line in the second candidate space could be the two ""special"" isomorphism classes of elliptic curves (with automorphism groups $\mathbb Z_6$ and $\mathbb Z_4$, respectively).  If we were to restore these two points, this would correct the ""discrepancy"" between the two candidate moduli spaces. The isomorphism of affine varieties from $\mathbb A^1_{\mathbb C}$ to $\mathbb{CP}^1\backslash\{\infty\}$, i.e. from the space of $j$-invariants to double covers of $\mathbb{CP}^1$ branched over $4$ points, would be $a\mapsto1728^{-1}a$. For this to be correct, it would require that the $j=0$ and $j=1728$ curves are branched over $4$ non-distinct points (perhaps a double branch point for one and a triple for the other)...could any of this hold water? (Or perhaps $j=0$ and $j=1728$ can't be realized as double covers at all?) Should any of this experimentation with the $g=1$ case inform the $g>1$ case?

I can't find a reference that answers this. UPDATE #1: Genus $g=1$ is not in the range of my question, but I was trying to use it for intuition nevertheless.  One of way of computing the moduli space of smooth elliptic curves gives me $\mathbb A^1_{\mathbb C}$ as the moduli space (i.e. using the $j$-invariant) and another way gives me $\mathbb{CP}^1\backslash\{0,1,\infty\}$ (by studying $2:1$ covers of $\mathbb{CP}^1$ branched over $4$ pairwise-distinct points).  Both are one-dimensional and noncompact, but which is the better candidate for the moduli space?  I know that the issue of moduli of elliptic curves is quite a subtle one, and the real answer lies in the world of stacks, but if your only two options were $\mathbb A^1_{\mathbb C}$ and $\mathbb{CP}^1\backslash\{0,1,\infty\}$, which would you choose?  (""Neither"" is not allowed!)  Does the $j$-invariant simply give deformations around some particular elliptic curve of one's choice, and hence makes the former space into the tangent space to the moduli space, while the latter space is the ""actual"" moduli space (in some sense)? UPDATE #2: It occurred to me that the $0$ and $1$ that are being omitted from the projective line in the second candidate space could be the two ""special"" isomorphism classes of elliptic curves (with automorphism groups $\mathbb Z_6$ and $\mathbb Z_4$, respectively).  If we were to restore these two points, this would correct the ""discrepancy"" between the two candidate moduli spaces. The isomorphism of affine varieties from $\mathbb A^1_{\mathbb C}$ to $\mathbb{CP}^1\backslash\{\infty\}$, i.e. from the space of $j$-invariants to double covers of $\mathbb{CP}^1$ branched over $4$ points, would be $a\mapsto1728^{-1}a$. For this to be correct, it would require that the $j=0$ and $j=1728$ curves are branched over $4$ non-distinct points (perhaps a double branch point for one and a triple for the other)...could any of this hold water? (Or perhaps $j=0$ and $j=1728$ can't be realized as double covers at all?) Should any of this experimentation with the $g=1$ case inform the $g>1$ case?

57,Relationship Between the Albanese Variety and $\rm{Pic}^{0}(X)$,Relationship Between the Albanese Variety and,\rm{Pic}^{0}(X),"I've been learning about the Albanese variety $\rm{Alb}(X)$ of a projective variety $X$.  As discussed very well in John Baez' blog ( https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2016/08/the_magic_of_algebraic_geometr.html ) there is apparently an analogy between $\rm{Alb}(X)$ and the free abelian group on a pointed set.  To my knowledge the correspondence goes something like this: Let $\rm{Set}_{*}$ be the category of pointed sets.  One can define a functor from $\rm{Set}_{*}$ into the category of abelian groups $\rm{AbGrp}$, defined by taking a pointed set to the free abelian group it generates.  This construction satisfies the universal property you would expect. In the world of varieties, the Albanese map is given as a functor $$\rm{Var}_{*} \to \rm{AbVar}$$ where you send a pointed variety $X$ to its Albanese variety $\rm{Alb}(X)$.  The Albanese is classified by a universal property, so I guess this is what motivates people to think of the Albanese as the ""free abelian variety of a projective variety.""  This makes sense to me, as it seems like most of the literature defines the Albanese by this universal property, and its more concrete geometrical properties are proved as theorems.  So my questions are about its geometrical properties: I've heard the Albanese variety is dual to the degree-zero Picard group: $$\rm{Alb}(X) \simeq (\rm{Pic}^{0}(X))^{*}$$ I know that $\rm{Pic}^{0}(X)$ classifies degree-zero line bundles on $X$, but I was hoping someone could lay out the correspondence between its dual and the Albanese.

Find a smooth proper $Y\to S$ where $S=\mathrm{Spec}(R)$ for $R$ a DVR with mixed characteristic ($R/m=k$ of characteristic $p>0$, and $\mathrm{Frac}(R)=K$ of characteristic $0$) with the following property: Some Hodge number satisfies $h^{st}(Y_0)> h^{st}(\overline{Y}_\eta)$ where $\overline{Y}_\eta$ means the geometric generic fiber. So we are looking for an example where some Hodge number jumps up at the special fiber. I don't see any immediate reason why this can't happen, since they should be merely upper semicontinuous. Here is my attempted proof of why this gives a counterexample. Well, first $Y_0/k$ is a characteristic $p$ variety that can be lifted to characteristic $0$ just by construction. Suppose $n=s+t$ from the example. We have the sequence of (in)equalities $h^n(Y_0, \mathbb{Q}_\ell)= h^n(\overline{Y}_\eta, \mathbb{Q}_\ell)=\sum h^{pq}(\overline{Y}_\eta)<\sum h^{pq}(Y_0)$ which comes respectively from smooth base change for etale cohomology, and then the fact that $\overline{Y}_\eta$ is a smooth variety over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$ (by Deligne-Illusie the Hodge-de Rham SS degenerates at $E_1$ but maybe the error is that $\ell$-adic and de Rham don't match up?), and then the assumption about Hodge numbers jumping. In other words, such a variety $Y_0$ would be liftable with $\ell$-adic and Hodge Betti numbers being different. Question: What is a good example of where this happens?

First definition is: $$X(k)=\{p\in X | \kappa(p)\simeq k\}.$$ Here, of course $\kappa(p)$ denotes the residue field $\mathcal{O}_{p}/\mathfrak{m}_p$. The other definition concerns general rings $R$, or if $X$ is defined over a field $k$, algebras $R$ over $k$. $$X(R)=\mathrm{Hom}(\mathrm{Spec} R,X).$$ Are they equivalent? If $G$ is a group scheme, it easily follows from the second definition that $G(k)$ has a group structure.
