How do I calculate the intersection of $\binom{24+9}{10}$ and $\binom{18+9}{10}$? Thanks...",,['combinatorics']

47,Uniqueness of complete binary trees,Uniqueness of complete binary trees,,"While writing a code about Huffman coding (it doesn't matter what it is), I came with an idea that I could check whether the tree would be flat * without actually constructing it. For that quick check (which I won't specify here) to work, it would suffice that one little lemma is true and that is what I couldn't prove. The hypothesis: Every rooted tree which satisfies: it is completely binary, the number of leaves in it is a power of 2 and if it has a leaf at depth $d$ , then it has less than $2^{k-1}$ leaves at depth $d+k$ , for all $k\ge2$ , is necessarily flat. My thoughts: It is hard to test because of the condition 2: there are just a few completely binary trees with 2 and 4 leaves, but many with 8. However, I didn't find any counterexample to this hypothesis. I tried to prove it clasically case by case together with simple logic but nothing... I also tried formulating the conditions in terms of series where $i$ -th coefficient is the number of leaves at depth $i$ , but it didn't see much glory either. The definitions: a tree is a finite non-empty acyclic graph, a rooted tree is a tree with one distinguished node called the root , the depth of a node $x$ in a rooted tree is the number of edges in the shortest path from $x$ to the root, a child of a node $x$ in a rooted tree is a neighbour of $x$ which is not on the shortest path from $x$ to the root, a leaf of a rooted tree is its node with no children, a completely binary tree is a rooted tree where every node has exactly 0 or 2 children, a flat tree is a rooted tree whose all leaves have the same depth.","While writing a code about Huffman coding (it doesn't matter what it is), I came with an idea that I could check whether the tree would be flat * without actually constructing it.

The only part that is left is computing the number of edges. The idea in Frieze's and Karonski's proof is first showing that $(1-(x/c)^2)m$ is asymptotically the expected number of edges in $C_0$ and then showing that the number of edges $X$ concentrates in the following sense: For every $\epsilon>0$ $$ P((1-\epsilon)(1-(x/c)^2)m \leq X \leq (1+\epsilon)(1-(x/c)^2)m) = P((1-\epsilon)E[X]\leq X \leq (1+\epsilon)E[X]) \rightarrow 1 $$ as $n \to \infty$ . This is equivalent to showing $$ P(\vert X - E[X] \vert > \epsilon E[X]) \rightarrow 0 $$ and this we can use Chebyschevs inequality on so we need to compute the variance of $X$ . As $$ X=\sum_{j=1}^m 1_{\{e_j \in C_0\}}, $$ then \begin{align*} E[X^2] &= \sum_{j=1}^m P(e_j \in C_0) + \sum_{j \neq i} P(e_j \in C_0, e_i \in C_0) \\ &= m (1-(x/c)^2)+\sum_{j \neq i} P(e_j \in C_0, e_i \in C_0). \end{align*} Frieze and Karonski now claim that $$ P(e_j \in C_0, e_i \in C_0)=(1+o(1))P(e_i \in C_0)P(e_j \in C_0)  $$ where $o(1)$ denotes a sequence converging to 0. This is the part I need help with! (Note if would be fine to show $\leq$ instead of $=$ ). My first instinct was that writing $P(e_j \in C_0, e_i \in C_0)=P(e_j \in C_0 \mid e_i \in C_0)P(e_i \in C_0)$ brings us ""halfway there"" but I think it hard to work with this conditional probability so maybe this not a viable approach. If one follows the proof in Frieze's and Karonski's book, the idea is to introduce a subgraph $G_2$ which is exactly the original graph but without the two edges $e_i,e_j$ . Then we can consider the unique giant component here $C_2 \subseteq C_0$ . My attempt at the calculation is then the following (here $e_i \in C_0$ means $e_i$ is an edge of the the component while $e_j \cap C_0 \neq \emptyset$ means that they share at least one vertex): \begin{align*} \ & P(e_i \in C_0, e_j \in C_0) \\[0.6em]  &= P(\{e_j \in C_0, e_i \in C_0\} \cap (\{e_i \cap C_2 \neq \emptyset , e_j \cap C_2 \neq \emptyset\} \cup \{e_i \cap C_2 \neq \emptyset , e_j \cap C_2 \neq \emptyset\}^c ) ) \\[0.6em] & = P(e_j \in C_0, e_i \in C_0,e_i \cap C_2 \neq \emptyset , e_j \cap C_2 \neq \emptyset) \\[0.6em] & \quad+P(\{e_j \in C_0, e_i \in C_0\}\cap\{e_i \cap C_2 \neq \emptyset\} \cup \{ e_j \cap C_2 \neq \emptyset\}) \\[0.6em] &\leq P(e_i \cap C_2 \neq \emptyset , e_j \cap C_2 \neq \emptyset) \\[0.6em] &\quad+ P(e_j \in C_0, e_i \in C_0,e_i \cap C_2 =\emptyset) + P(e_j \in C_0, e_i \in C_0,e_j \cap C_2 = \emptyset) \\[0.6em] &\leq P(e_i \cap C_2 \neq \emptyset , e_j \cap C_2 \neq \emptyset) \\[0.6em] &\quad+ P(e_i \cap (C_0\setminus C_2) \neq \emptyset) + P(e_j \cap (C_0\setminus C_2) \neq \emptyset) \\[0.6em] &\leq P(e_i \cap C_2 \neq \emptyset , e_j \cap C_2 \neq \emptyset) + 2 \underbrace{\frac{Klog(n)\choose 2}{n \choose 2}}_{\to  0 \text{ as } n \to \infty} \\[0.6em] & \approx P(e_i \cap C_2 \neq \emptyset , e_j \cap C_2 \neq \emptyset)\\[0.6em] & = P(e_i \cap C_2 \neq \emptyset , e_j \cap C_2 \neq \emptyset, e_j \cap e_i \neq \emptyset)+P(e_i \cap C_2 \neq \emptyset , e_j \cap C_2 \neq \emptyset, e_j \cap e_i = \emptyset)\\[0.6em] & = P(e_i \cap C_2 \neq \emptyset , e_j \cap C_2 \neq \emptyset, e_j \cap e_i \neq \emptyset) \\[0.6em] & \quad +P(e_i \cap C_2 \neq \emptyset, e_j \cap e_i = \emptyset \mid e_j \cap C_2 \neq \emptyset)P(e_j \cap C_2 \neq \emptyset)\\[0.6em] \end{align*} In the fifth step we used that earlier in the proof it was shown that all other small componenets are of order at most $K log(n)$ where $K>0$ is some constant. But now I cannot get any further. Can anyone help me finish the computation? Update: I have made some progress (?). I have shown that $$ P(e_i \cap C_2 \neq \emptyset , e_j \cap C_2 \neq \emptyset, e_j \cap e_i \neq \emptyset) \leq P(e_j \cap e_i \neq \emptyset) = \frac{2(n-2)}{{n \choose 2} - 1} \to 0 $$ as $n \to \infty$ . Furthermore from earlier in the proof it was shown that $P(e_j \in C_0)=P(e_j \cap C_1 = \emptyset) \approx (x/c)^2$ (where $C_1$ denotes the giant without just one of the edges and $x$ and $c$ are constants). By the same reasoning (although I am not completely sure..?) as there one would get that $P(e_j \cap C_2 = \emptyset) \approx (x/c)^2$ . Hence we have $$ P(e_i \in C_0, e_j \in C_0) = (o(1) + P(e_i \cap C_2 \neq \emptyset, e_j \cap e_i = \emptyset \mid e_j \cap C_2 \neq \emptyset) )(1-(\frac{x}{c})^2). $$ Although this is not exactly what the book want, it would suffice to show that $$ P(e_i \cap C_2 \neq \emptyset, e_j \cap e_i = \emptyset \mid e_j \cap C_2 \neq \emptyset) \approx P(e_i \cap C_2 \neq \emptyset). $$ It kinda makes sense that as we intersection with the vertices of $e_i$ and $e_j$ being disjoint, the conditioning doesn't really matter and asymptotically we have ""independence"".

I'm pretty sure it's correct, but I have no formal proof. I think I have an informal proof: For a combination of dots in the slots to make a palindrome, the two halves of the string of slots must be mirror images. That means we're dealing with the halves of $n$ and $k$ , as for every arrangement of dots there is on one half of the string, there is only one possible arrangement on the other half (that arrangement being the mirror image). As such, if both $n$ and $k$ are even, the number of palindromes will be equal $n/2 \choose k/2$ . If $n$ is odd, but $k$ is even, then none of the dots may take the central slot. This is because it would then mean an uneven number of dots $2y -1$ would be distributed over an even number of slots $2x +1 -1$ . In such a case, there will always be one more or one less on one of the halves. As such, no dot can be placed in the central slot. This reduced the amount of available slots from $n/2$ to $(n-1)/2$ or just $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$ . That means the number of palindromes in this case is $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor \choose k/2$ . If both $n$ and $k$ are odd, then a dot must occupy the central slot. That removes both a slot and a dot from the previously odd number of slots and dots (respectively), meaning we're left with an even number of dots distributed onto an even number of slots. Thus, the number of palindromes is $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor \choose \lfloor k/2 \rfloor$ . If $n$ is even but $k$ is odd, then there is no central slot to remove a dot, meaning there are no palindromes. If this is correct, how can I make it into a formal proof? If it is incorrect, where did I go wrong? EDIT: Forgot to add the rule that the dots cannot overlap.

81,Lower bound on the number of walks of length $l$ in a graph,Lower bound on the number of walks of length  in a graph,l,"Let $G$ be any connected simple graph, fix some positive integer $l$ and denote by $w_l(v,w)$ the number of walks of length $l$ between vertices $v$ and $w$ . I am looking for a lower bound on $\min_{v,w} w_l(v,w)$ . In this publication I found that there is a pair $v,w$ such that $w_l(v,w)\geq \dfrac{\bar{d}^l}{n}$ where $\bar{d}$ is the average degree in $G$ and $n$ the number of vertices in $G$ . I would like to extend this to a uniform lower bound (which will be worse of course). I am particularly interested in the form of the lower bound $\dfrac{x^l}{n}$ for some $x$ to be determined. A first guess was to replace $\bar{d}$ by the minimal degree $\delta$ but I found counter examples where this was not correct. Do you have any suggestions or literature references? EDIT: The existence of such a $x$ is evident, since $x^l\to 0$ continuously as $x\to 0$ . And we know that there is a pair $v,w$ such that $w_l(v,w)\geq \dfrac{\bar{d}^l}{n}$ but (by the averaging argument in the paper) we have $\dfrac{\bar{d}^l}{n}> \min_{v,w} w_l(v,w)>0$ as soon as there is more than one degree in $G$ . Consequently, the function $f(x) = \dfrac{\bar{x}^l}{n}- \min_{v,w} w_l(v,w)$ satisfies $f(\bar{d})>0$ and $f(0) \leq 0$ and $f$ is continuous. Therefore, we have a $x_0$ such that $f(x_0)=0$ . Evidently, deriving $x_0$ from this equation is like a dog chaising its own tail. So we need a $x_0'$ which is a bit smaller than $x_0$ by monotony of $f$ as $x\to 0$ . Again, here I am stuck. EDIT 3: Based on the reponse and comments by Brandon du Preez I decided to put loops on every vertex. Unfortunately, this way, we lose the result from the paper I cited because it uses spectral theoretical tools and especially the fact that the adjacency matrix has trace 0. But, let $\phi'$ be a walk of length $l$ in this new graph $G'$ (with loops) then there is a $k\in\{0,...,l-1\}$ and a walk $\phi$ in $G$ of length $l-k$ such that $\phi$ consists of all ""real"" steps without taking loops. I, then, only have to arrange the loops between the $l-k$ visited vertices (with multiplicities of course). Therefore, I obtain the formula for the number of walks between $v,w$ in $G'$ as $$w_l^{G'}(v,w)=\sum_{k=0}^{l-1}\sum_{h_1+...+h_{l-k}=k}\binom{k}{h_1,...,h_{l-k}}w_{l-k}(v,w)$$ Now, I am stuck again. This is obviously greater zero for any connected graph for sufficiently large $l$ but can I get the desired estimate from it? Looks a bit like a multinomial theorem if you replace $w_l(v,w)$ by something of the form $x^l$ but not quite.

This is exercise 20 in page 28 in the book generatingfunctionology : Let $f(n,m,k)$ be the number of strings of $n$ $0$ 's and 1's that contain exactly $m$ $1$ 's, no $k$ of which are consecutive. Then (a) Find a recurrence formula for $f$ . It should have $f(n,m,k)$ on the left side, and exactly three terms on the right. (b) Find, in simple closed form, the generating functions $$ F_k(x,y)=\sum_{n,m\geq 0}f(n,m,k)x^ny^m\quad(k=1,2,...)$$ Here's what I have: I didn't get exactly three terms in the recurrence, but I did come up with one plausible. Well, we want to use $n-m$ $0$ 's to separate $m$ $1$ 's. That's the same as putting $m$ balls into $n-m+1$ ordered boxes, and each box can at most contain $k-1$ balls. We divide the cases by how many balls the last box has: it could be $0,1,...,k-1$ . Hence we have the recurrence relation: $$f(n,m,k)=\sum_{i=1}^{k}f(n-i,m-i+1,k)$$ This recurrence should hold for arbitrary $n,m,k$ as long as we specify the appropriate initial values, or at least it should hold for $k$ large enough. (This might be where I ran into problems but I can not see it immediately). However, when I carry this to the next part I am confused, because \begin{aligned}  F_k(x,y)& = \sum_{n,m\geq 0}f(n,m,k)x^ny^m \\ & = \sum_{n,m\geq 0}\sum_{i=1}^{k}f(n-i,m-i+1,k)x^ny^m \\ & = \sum_{i=1}^k\sum_{n,m\geq 0}f(n-i,m-i+1,k)x^ny^m \\ & = \sum_{i=1}^kx^iy^{i-1}\sum_{n,m\geq 0}f(n-i,m-i+1,k)x^{n-i}y^{m-i+1}\\ & = \sum_{i=1}^kx^iy^{i-1}F_k(x,y) \end{aligned} The second to bottom equality holds in my mind because $f(m,n,k)=0$ if either of $m$ or $n$ is $0$ . However, it confuses me since at the end the equation implies $F_k(x,y)=0$ ? Where did I go wrong?

But I always follow the same set of rules: If I say a number of ""Dwayne"" 's, $n$ , I have to say the other two items ""The Rock"" and ""Johnson"" $n$ times as well. Basically the full name needs to be said a whole number of times throughout the expression. If I say ""The Rock"" it must be because I said a corresponding ""Dwayne"" sometime before it. For example: ""Dwayne"" ""The Rock"" ""The Rock"" ""Dwayne"" ""Johnson"" ""Johnson"" is not valid. The same is the case for the ""Johnson"" 's after ""The Rock"" . i.e. They have to appear in order. So my question is: For a given number $n$ of ""Dwayne"", ""The Rock"", and ""Johnson"" 's how many different Dwayne The Rock Johnson orderings can I have that follow these rules.","Let me explain.

99,Question on tiling of a $2n\times 2n$ square,Question on tiling of a  square,2n\times 2n,"$\text{Introduction}$ This is a classical question: How many pavements of an $m\times n$ board (such that $mn$ is even) with $1\times 2$ and $2\times 1$ tiles? There are several beautiful results and articles related to this. If you aren't familiar with the problem, read this and this (there are many results and refferences and proofs). The main thing I want to focus on is the formula for the number of such tilings: For an $m\times n$ board with $m$ even (WLOG), we have $$\prod_{k=1}^{\frac{1}{2}m}\prod_{l=1}^{n}2\sqrt{\cos^2{\frac{k\pi}{m+1}}+\cos^2{\frac{l\pi}{n+1}}}$$ $\text{My question}$ However, I want to ask this: Suppose we place one $1\times 2$ tile (or $2\times 1$ tile) on an $m\times n$ board (such that $mn$ is even) and call it $\mathcal{T}$ . How many pavements with $1\times2$ and $2\times1$ tiles are there, which contain $\mathcal{T}$ . Lets call this number $f(\mathcal{T})$ This seems very hard. To begin with, analysing some small cases, like $2\times 3$ and $4\times 4$ boards, different $\mathcal{T}$ s lead to different $f(\mathcal{T})$ s. However, on the plus side, Using complex numbers mathematicians have developed some pretty powerful methods of controlling tilings and configurations. Of course this can be both generalized to more $\mathcal{T}$ s (which is very unlikely however) and reduced to special cases such as $2n\times 2n$ boards or $2\times n$ boards (well, this $2\times n$ case is actually really simple using induction) . Any progress upon the problem is appreciated! I highly belive that a beautiful result awaits in the $2n\times 2n$ case, as for the general case. I am not a specialist in combinatorics or pavements and sincerely apologize for not providing more context. However, will continue to try to solve this and post updates if I find anything. Thank you! P.S. If anyone can code a program to find the number of such tilings for a constant tile $\mathcal{T}$ which we can input, it would help a lot and I count it as an accepted answer, unless someone shows up with a proof.","This is a classical question: How many pavements of an board (such that is even) with and tiles?
