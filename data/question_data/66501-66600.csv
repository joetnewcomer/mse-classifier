If it ends in a consonant, we must have obtained it from a valid word of length by placing a vowel followed by a consonant behind it. In all other situations we simply place a vowel behind a word of length . We get for : One can verify that this indeed gives for . We can solve this recursion via an auxiliary equation of the form: Which factorises as: So we get solutions : We can now plug in our initial conditions and We get: I feel that this is probably correct, but I am unsure.

51,How many colors are necessary for a W-polyomino to never cover a color more than once?,How many colors are necessary for a W-polyomino to never cover a color more than once?,,"A W-polyomino is a polyomino with 2 cells in each row (except possibly the last, which may have one cell), and each row offset once cell to the right. Below are the first few W polyominoes. How many colors are necessary to color the plane, so that no matter how we place the polyomino, it never covers two cells of the same color? For even $n$ , we need $n$ colors: a coloring is given by $C_n(x, y) = (x + yn/2) \bmod n$ . This is a coloring with $n$ colors that repeat in each row, and each second row is offset by half $n$ . For example, this is the coloring $C_6$ . For odd $n$ , we can use $C_{n+1}$ to show that we need at most $n + 1$ colors. The missing piece is to prove that $n$ colors is not enough. (This is my question.) So far: (We ignore the monomino, which is an exception.) For $n = 3$ , we need 4 (we can cover any two cells of a $2\times 2$ square). For $n = 5$ , we need 6 (a bookkeeping proof is given in Polyominoes on a Multicolored Infinite Grid ). The proof used for $n = 5$ is not very difficult, but it is not clear how it can be generalized. Background: I am looking at the general case for polyominoes. From the paper I linked above I could devise some general techniques. I recently asked the same question for rectangles , which is very relevant as we can often reduce the problem to that, or at least establish a range. Here follows some of the general principles. $H(P)$ is the rectangular hull of polyomino $P$ , and $C(P)$ the number of colors we need to color $P$ , and $|P|$ is the number of cells in $P$ . $|P| \leq C(P) \leq C(H(P))$ . (The number of colors is between the number of cells and the number of colors we need for the hull). If $P$ covers any two cells of $Q$ , then $C(P) \geq C(Q)$ . If $Q \subset P$ , then $C(P) \geq C(Q)$ . (This follows from above and is usually more convenient.) If $P$ is an L shape (a rectangle with a rectangle removed at the corner), then $C(P) = C(H(P))$ . If $P$ can fit inside $Q$ in all orientations, and $Q$ tiles the plane, $C(P) \leq |Q|$ . A typical scenario: Consider this polyomino $P$ : # ## ### It has the L-tetromino as subset, so we need at least the same as the hull of the L, which is $R(3, 2)$ , which has been shown to need 8 colors. Since the hull of $P$ is $R(4, 2)$ , which also requires 8 colors, we know we need 8 colors for $P$ too. The W-pentomino is the first polyomino that cannot be handled by the above.

The difference is that for each place I can use only a certain set of items and without repeating a certain item, eg: [1, 2, 3] # I can only use these for first place [2, 3, 4] # I can only use these for second place [3, 4, 5] # I can only use these for third place Examples of valid arrangements: (1, 2, 3) or (3, 2, 5) Examples of invalid arrangements: (2, 2, 3) I would like to find some calculation for this problem, I have solved the same using dynamic programming, but I believe that it is possible to isolate some mathematical method .. The input is defined by x and y , x means the number of numbers in each group, y means the number of groups. The first group starts with [1, .. x] , the second group onwards begins with [1 + j, .... x + j] where j is the group that goes from 0 ... (y - 1), eg: x = 3, y = 4 # represents the count of: [1, 2, 3] [2, 3, 4] [3, 4, 5] [4, 5, 6]  x = 5, y = 3 # represents the count of: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] For example, the result of this case x=2, y=2 would be 7: [1, 2, 3] # Valid numbers for first place [2, 3, 4] # Valid numbers for first place  # the valid numbers is (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2,  # 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), so the answer is 7.

Initially all the cells are colored white. We may perform the following operation: choose one column or one row and change the color of all cells in this column or row. Is it possible by repeating the operation to obtain a table with exactly $16$ black cells? Now I wonder if a following solution is correct? All the matrix here are $18\times 18$ . Let $S$ be a matrix with all entry $1$ and $F$ be a matrix with exactly $16$ entries with $0$ and the other entries are $1$ . Let $A_i$ be a matrix with all entries $1$ on $i$ -th row, for $1\leq i\leq 18$ and the other are 0 and with all entries $1$ on $(i-18)$ -th column for $19\leq i\leq 36$ and the other are zero. So, for example: $$A_2 =\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & \dots & 0&0\\ 1&1&\dots &1&1\\ 0 & 0 & \dots & 0&0\\ \vdots & \vdots & \dots & \vdots &\vdots\\ 0 & 0 & \dots & 0&0 \end{bmatrix} \;\;\;{\rm and}\;\;\; A_{19} =\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & \dots & 0&0\\ 1&0&\dots &0&0\\ 1 & 0 & \dots & 0&0\\ \vdots & \vdots & \dots & \vdots &\vdots\\ 1 & 0 & \dots & 0&0 \end{bmatrix} $$ We can understand a table as a matrix with entry $1$ if corresponding cell is white and $0$ if it is black. So $S$ is a starting matrix and $F$ a final matrix. Now each recoloring of a given matrix $M$ is actually $M+A_i$ for some $i\leq 36$ So after some transformations we have equality like this $$F = S + a_1A_1+a_2A_2+...+a_{36}A_{36}$$ where $a_i\in \{ 0,1\}$ for all $i$ . Mark $F-S = D$ , so $D$ is a matrix with exactly $16$ ones. Now what can we say about $a_1,a_2,...$ ? Since $D$ has exactly $16$ ones it must have at least two columns and two rows with only zeros. We can assume that all entries in first $2$ rows and first $2$ columns are $0$ , so $D$ is like: $$ D =\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0&\dots & 0&0\\ 0 & 0 &0 &\dots &0&0\\ 0 & 0 & *& \dots & *&*\\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \dots &\vdots& \vdots\\ 0 & 0 & *&\dots & *&* \end{bmatrix} $$ If $a_1=1$ then each $a_{19},a_{20},...a_{36}$ must also be $1$ since in first row must be all $0$ . But then we must have also $a_2,...,a_{18}$ all $1$ since in first column are only $0$ . This means that $D$ is a zero matrix which is not true. So $a_1=0$ and thus all $a_{19},a_{20},...a_{36}$ are $0$ and then also all $a_2,...,a_{18}$ are $0$ so $D$ is zero matrix again. A contradiction. This is not a duplicate.

A small example to clarify: There are $3$ integer-sided cuboids with a volume of $8$, namely $8\times 1\times 1$, $4\times 2\times 1$, $2\times 2\times 2$. I realised that since the prime-factorisation of $60^3$ is $60^3=(2^2\times 3\times 5)^3=2^6\times 3^3\times 5^3$ Then the problem is equivalent to ""How many ways can we distribute $6$ identical objects (i.e. the $2$s), and $3$ identical objects of a different kind (i.e. the $3$s), and $3$ identical objects of a different kind again (i.e. the $5$s) into $3$ identical groups?"" For example, $60^3=(2^4\times 3)\times (2\times 5^2)\times (2\times 3^2\times 5)$ would be one possible cuboid. Note that any of the $3$ identical groups are allowed to be empty (this would mean a side length of $1$ in the cuboid). To put the problem another way, how many ways can we distribute the letters of the word ""AAAAAABBBCCC"" into $3$ identical groups? I have actually come up with a solution, $475$, by a sort of recursive method that I devised. I have copied my solution below. It feels very long and involved, so I would like to know if there a quicker way that relies on more standard recursively-defined functions, and is more easily generalisable. I am aware that related problems can be solved using Sterling numbers of the second kind, for example, or Bell numbers. But I have not been able to find any example of a problem like this, where the objects are a mixture of identical and distinct (what should I call this? Categorised?) and the groups are identical. Feel free NOT to read on, but here is my long-winded solution: Firstly, how many ways are there to distribute the 6 2s across the 3 groups? We can enumerate them: 0,0,6 0,1,5 0,2,4 0,3,3 1,1,4 1,2,3 2,2,2 Total: 7 ways Ok now how many ways are there to distribute the 3 3s? 0,0,3 0,1,2 1,1,1 Total: 3 ways Does this mean that there are 7 x 3 = 21 ways to distribute the 6 2s and the 3 3s? No! Since, it matters which of the 7 distributions of 2s we combine with which of the 3 distributions of 3s. The important feature of a distribution, for seeing how it combines with a set of possible distributions ‚Äúoverlaid‚Äù onto it, is which groups (if any) have been made distinguishable from each other by the first distribution. There are 3 possible patterns: All groups indistinguishable (call this A) Two groups indistinguishable, the other distinguishable (call this B) All groups distinguishable (call this C) Going back to the 7 possible distributions of 2s and labelling them A, B or C accordingly: 0,0,6   B 0,1,5   C 0,2,4   C 0,3,3   B 1,1,4   B 1,2,3   C 2,2,2   A So overall we have 1 A, 3 Bs and 3 Cs. At this point we can create our own ‚Äúalgebra‚Äù and use an algebraic-style shorthand (bearing in mind that A, B and C don‚Äôt represent numbers but patterns): A + 3B + 3C And for the 3 3s, we have: 0,0,3   B 0,1,2   C 1,1,1   A Making A + B + C Similarly, for the 3 5s we would have A + B + C Now, how do these all combine? First let‚Äôs consider overlaying the 3 possible distributions of 3s onto the 7 possible distributions of 2s. And let‚Äôs suppose that we overlay a C-distribution (all 3 containers distinguishable) onto another C-distribution. How many combined distributions does that give us? It gives us 3 x 2 x 1 = 6. And what are the patterns (A, B or C) for these distributions? They are all Cs. And so, in our homemade algebra, we can introduce a * symbol for overlaying distributions of given patterns, and say: C * C = 6C So, how many distributions do we get, and with what patterns, by overlaying the 1 C-distribution of 3s onto the 3 C-distributions of 2s? C * 3C = 18C Now we can go through a similar process for combining B with C, B with B etc. Note that, since an A-pattern is equivalent to the blank slate we started with, ‚Äúmultiplying‚Äù by A has no effect: A * C = C A * B = B A * A = A Note also that this form of ‚Äúmultiplication‚Äù is commutative, i.e. B * C = C * B etc, since we‚Äôll get the same number of combined distributions whichever distribution we ‚Äúput there first‚Äù. Some thought tells us that B * C = 3C, since if we begin with a C, there are 3 possible places to overlay the distinguishable container of the B. And by similar sorts of reasoning, B * B = B + C Now combining everything together, (A + 3B + 3C) * (A + B + C) = (A * A) + (A * B) + (A * C) + 3(B * A) + 3(B * B) + 3(B * C) + 3(C * A) + 3(C * B) + 3(C * C) (Interesting to note that the distributive rule for ‚Äúmultiplication‚Äù in this sense is valid, since we are combining every possible distribution of 2s with every possible distribution of 3s) = A + B + C + 3B + 3(B + C) + 9C + 3C + 9C + 18C = A + 7B + 43C All that is left to do now is overlay the possible distributions of 5s: (A + 7B + 43C) * (A + B + C) = A + B + C + 7B + 43C + 7(B * B) + 50(B * C) + 43(C * C) = A + B + C + 7B + 43C + 7B + 7C + 150C + 258C = A + 15B + 459C Making a total of 475 distinct cuboids.","The question I initially thought of that prompted this was ""How many distinct integer-sided cuboids are there with a volume of $60^3$?"".

You may choose to not use any number of the beads. For example, Suanpans mimic Sorobans if you forget 1 lower bead and 1 upper bead. Suanpans can also perform binary math if you use 1 of the lower beads and nothing else.

In set theoretic notation $$j^2 = \#\{(l, m): l, m \in \mathbb{N},\,l,m \le j\}.$$ Thus we can write $S_2(n)$ as the number of elements of  a set of triples. Basically we use the third component of the triple to write down which term of the sum the ordered triple belongs to. $$S_2(n) = \#\{(j, l, m) : j, l, m \in \mathbb{N},\,l, m\le j,\, j \le n\}.$$ Thus the number we seek, $S_2(n)$ is the number of triples of natural numbers less than or equal to $n$ , so that the first component is greater than or equal to the last two components. Gauss' trick generalizes to the following observation. For any ordered triple, one of the components is at least as big as the other $2$ . This suggests we should compare $3$ copies of $S_2(n)$ to $n^3$ which is the number of triples of natural numbers less than or equal to $n$ . But we have to be careful, we are counting triples where there are two components larger than the third twice and we are counting triples where all three components are equal three times. Now observe that the number of triples of natural numbers less than or equal to $n$ with all components equal, formally $$\#\{(j, j, j) : j \in \mathbb{N},\,j \le n\}$$ is just equal to $n$ , the number of choices for $j$ . It is also easy to count triples that have the first two components large and the third smaller. We observe that $$\#\{(j, j, l) : j, l \in \mathbb{N},\,j \le n,\,l \le j\} = S_1(n).$$ We get this because for each $j$ there are $j$ choices of $l$ , so we are summing the first $n$ numbers. Then like Gauss we observe that each triple with two equal components at least as the third, has the third component somewhere. Combining all these observations we can conclude that $$n^3 = 3S_2(n) - 3S_1(n) + n.$$ (Basically the first term correctly counts triples with all different components. The first term double counts triples with two equal components and one unequal but the second term subtracts one copy of each of these. The first term triple counts triples with all components the same, but the second term also triple counts them, so we have to add $n$ to correctly account for all triples.) Question. It's still not clear to me at all how we got $$n^3 = 3S_2(n) - 3S_1(n) + n.$$ I understand to some extent how we got the $3$ in front of the $S_2(n)$ , but it's not clear to me at all how the $3$ in front of the $S_1(n)$ popped up and why we're adding an $n$ . Sure, the parenthetical in the notes following the expression $$n^3 = 3S_2(n) - 3S_1(n) + n$$ sort of gives an explanation, but it doesn't really let me know why we end up getting $3$ , $-3$ , and $1$ as the specific coefficients in front of the $S_k(n)$ . Certainly the inclusion-exclusion principle is lurking around here, but I suffer from a lack of combinatorial skill, and the inclusion-exclusion principle hasn't been introduced by this point in the notes, much less proved. So could anyone add some more details, more intuition as to how they might come up $$n^3 = 3S_2(n) - 3S_1(n) + n?$$ Thank you! Update. John Griffin gave a very excellent answer, and I'm still trying to digest it. But is there a way of phrasing what he said in terms of the framework of the inclusion-exclusion principle? Also, is there a way, or I guess, ""tricks"", for visualizing the proof given in the notes of Katz?","See pages 4-5 of these notes here on calculus by Nets Katz.
