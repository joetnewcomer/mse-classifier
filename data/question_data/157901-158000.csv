11,Congruence between Bernoulli numbers,Congruence between Bernoulli numbers,,"I fell on the following fact as a by-product: If p is a prime number, then the sum of the Bernoulli numbers, from index 0 to p - 2, is congruent with - 1 modulo p. Do you know a simple proof ? Or a reference to the literature ? Thanks beforehand. Edit. It was not a very smart question. The congruence is an easy consequence of Bernoulli's formula for the sum of the $(p-2)$ -powers of the natural numbers from 1 to $p-2$ . Edit. As suggested by barto, I give the proof. For $p = 2$ , it is trivial, thus assume $p \geq 3$ . Bernoulli's summation formula is (for $m \geq 1$ ) : $$ (m+1) \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k^m = \sum_{k=0}^m \binom{m + 1}{k} B_k n^{m + 1 - k} $$ or in more detail $$ (m+1)(1^m + 2^m + \cdots + (n-1)^m) = \sum_{k=0}^m \binom{m + 1}{k} B_k n^{m + 1 - k}. $$ (I use the definition with $B_1 = -1/2$ . The Wikipedia article : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_number#Sum_of_powers uses the other definition, hence a slight difference.) With $n = p-1$ and $m = p-2$ , this becomes (1) $(p-1) \sum_{k=1}^{p-2} k^{p-2} = \sum_{k=0}^{p-2} \binom{p-1}{k} B_k (p-1)^{p-1-k}$ , where the involved Bernoulli numbers are $p$ -integral rational numbers. Now, by Fermat's little theorem, $\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} k^{p-2}$ (with one more term than in the preceding sum) is modulo $p$ the sum of the inverses of the $p-1$ nonzero elements. Since inversion is a bijection, this sum is equal modulo $p$ to $\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} k = p(p-1)/2$ , which is zero modulo $p$ . Thus (1) gives $-(p-1)(p-1)^{p-2} \equiv \sum_{k=0}^{p-2} \binom{p-1}{k} B_k (p-1)^{p-1-k} \pmod{p}$ $-1 \equiv \sum_{k=0}^{p-2} \binom{p-1}{k} B_k (p-1)^{p-1-k}\pmod{p}$ . But $\binom{p-1}{k} \equiv (-1)^{k} \pmod{p}$ , thus the right member is congruent modulo $p$ to $\sum_{k=0}^{p-2} B_k$ , and we are done. Edit : here is a simpler proof. It is well known that, for $m \geq 2$ , $\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} \binom{m}{i} B_{i} = 0.$ Putting $m=p-1$ , we find $\sum_{i=0}^{p-2} \binom{p-1}{i} B_{i} = 0.$ Since $\binom{p-1}{k} \equiv (-1)^{k} \pmod{p}$ and the involved Bernoulli numbers are $p$ -integral rational numbers, this gives $\sum_{i=0}^{p-2} (-1)^{i} B_{i} \equiv 0 \pmod{p}.$ Now, $B_{1} = -1/2$ and for $i$ odd and $> 1$ , $B_{i} = 0$ , hence the statement.","I fell on the following fact as a by-product: If p is a prime number, then the sum of the Bernoulli numbers, from index 0 to p - 2, is congruent with - 1 modulo p.
