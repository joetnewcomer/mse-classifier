So, we are trying to see is that $X$ Hausdorff, let $A\subset X$ compact, then A is closed. To prove this statement we will see that $X\setminus A$ is open because all it's points are interior.

Doing this process for all points in $A$ , we get $$a\in \bigcup_{a\in A}\mathcal{V}_a:=\mathcal{V}\subset X, \hspace{4mm} x\in \bigcap_{a\in A}\mathcal{U}_a:=\mathcal{U}\subset X\setminus A$$ where $a\in \mathcal{V}$ , $x\in \mathcal{U}$ , and $\mathcal{V}\cap\mathcal{U}=\emptyset$ . Notice that $\mathcal{V}$ is open (because it is an arbitrary union of open sets), but we cannot garantee that $\mathcal{U}$ is open. Now, as $A$ is compact, there exists a finite subcover $\{\mathcal{V}_{a_{i}}\}_{i=1}^{n}$ such that $$a\in \bigcup_{i=1}^n\mathcal{V}_{a_i}:=\mathcal{V'}\subset X, \hspace{4mm} x\in \bigcap_{i=1}^{n}\mathcal{U}_{a_i}:=\mathcal{U'}\subset X\setminus A$$ So, we have constructed a neighbourhood $\mathcal{U'}$ such that $x\in \mathcal{U'}\subset X\setminus A$ .

Now, observe that we can create a cover of $X$ just by adding one more open set. $$X\subset \bigcup_{a\in A}\mathcal{W}_a\cup(X\setminus A)$$ $X\setminus A$ is open because $A$ is closed. As $X$ is compact, we can find a finite subcover of $X$ , but the only way for $X$ to admit a finite subcover is that there exists a family of open sets $\{\mathcal{W}_{a_i}\}_{i=1}^{n}$ such that $$X\subset \bigcup_{i=1}^{n}\mathcal{W}_{a_i}\cup (X\setminus A)$$ But now, $\{\mathcal{W}_{a_i}\}_{i=1}^{n}$ is a finite subcover of open sets such that $A\subset \{\mathcal{W}_{a_i}\}_{i=1}^{n}$ $\hspace{7mm} \blacksquare$ So, as we saw, does this mean that inside a compact Hausdorff space $X$ , the closed and compact subsets are exactly the same?","So I was trying to see if anyone could confirm the veracity of this statement.

12,Rudin Theorem 2.30: relative openness,Rudin Theorem 2.30: relative openness,,"I do not fully understand Rudin's Theorem 2.30. The context, which is not immediately clear from the problem,  is a metric space $(X,d)$ and a subset $Y \subset X$ . The theorem states: Suppose $Y \subset X$ . A subset $E$ of $Y$ is open relative to $Y$ if and only if $E = Y \cap G$ for some open subset $G$ of $X$ . I've replicated Rudin's proof's verbatim below, and will add my questions after. Suppose $E$ is open relative to $Y$ . To each $p \in E$ there is a positive number $r_p$ such that that the conditions $d(p,q) < r_p$ , $q \in Y$ imply that $q \in E$ . Let $V_p$ be the set of all $q \in X$ such that $d(p,q) < r_p$ , and define $G = \bigcup\limits_{p \in E} V_p$ . Then $G$ is an open subset of $X$ , by Theorems 2.19 and 2.24. Since $p \in V_p$ for all $p \in E$ , it is clear that $E \subset G \cap Y$ . By our choice of $V_p$ , we have $V_p \cap Y \subset E$ for every $p \in E$ , so that $G \cap Y \subset E$ . Thus $E = G \cap Y$ , and one half of the theorem is proved. Conversely, if $G$ is open in $X$ and $E = G \cap Y$ , every $p \in E$ has a neighborhood $V_p \subset G$ . Then $V_p \cap Y \subset E$ , so that $E$ is open relative to $Y$ . First, I'm not sure that I understand fully what 'open relative to $Y$ ' means. The definition of open is: $W \subset X$ ( $X$ a metric space) is open if for every $u \in W$ , there exists $\epsilon > 0$ such that $N_{\epsilon} (u) \subset W$ . My understanding of 'relative openness' is as follows. If we have $W \subset U \subset X$ , and for every $u \in W$ , there exists $\epsilon > 0$ such that $N_{\epsilon} (u) \subset W \subset U$ , so we s ay $N_{\epsilon} (u)$ is ""open relative to $W$ "" or open in $W$ , which I believe are equivalent notions. Is that correct? (If not, what I'm about to say almost will be f alse.) The first assumption is that $E$ is open relative to $Y$ , so given $p \in E$ , there is $r_p > 0$ so that $N_{r_p} (p) \subset Y \subset X$ . We call $V_p = N_{r_p} (p)$ , which is a neighborhood and, by Theorem 2.19, open. The problem is: the theorem only says open, but open relative to what? I assume we say open relative to $Y$ since $V_p \subset W$ . Then $G$ is a union of open sets and therefore open by Theorem 2.24, but relative to what? I would assume $Y$ again, but Rudin asserts that $G$ is an open subset of $X$ . This isa. problem, because Rudin warns right before stating this theorem that we may have a set that is open relative to $Y$ but not an open subset of $X$ . So this leads me to believe that I'm misinterpreting this, and perhaps $V_p$ is open in $X$ only.

20,Various proofs: pairs of points in a circle = Möbius strip,Various proofs: pairs of points in a circle = Möbius strip,,"It is well-known that the space of ""pairs of points in a circle"" (also called the symmetric square of $S^1$ ) can be identified with a Möbius strip. I don't know where the idea originates, but it is a neat elementary result in topology, which has a beautiful application in Vaughan's proof of the rectangular peg problem ( 3blue1brown gives a really nice account of this ). Inspired by a talk I saw on related results, I've been trying to compile a list of proofs that the symmetric square of $S^1$ is a Möbius strip. To be specific, the space $Sym^2(S^1)$ is constructed from $S^1\times S^1$ by identifying $(x,y)\sim (y,x)$ for every $x,y\in S^1$ and taking the quotient topology. Hence, I am asking this question as community wiki, to try and learn of other peoples' favorite ways to prove this result. A quick ground rule: if someone beats you to the chase on your favorite proof, maybe comment to show your preference for it, rather than posting the same proof again? But if you have a proof that seems like a close variant of one already posted, feel free to post it! Since these are all about the same result, there are bound to be variations on the same idea. Also, if you know where your proof comes from, please give proper credit to its originator. If the proof is your own, be explicit about that fact, so that I can make sure to give you proper credit if I ever cite it elsewhere. Here are summaries of some proofs that I know of, to get the ball rolling: View the torus $S^1\times S^1$ as square with opposite sides identified. The identification $(x,y)\sim (y,x)$ corresponds to folding the square along its diagonal, so we get a triangle with gluing between two adjacent sides. A brief cut-and-paste argument turns this into the usual presentation of the Möbius strip. (I don't know where this argument originates.) Charles Livingston: To any pair of points $x,y\in S^1$ in the unit circle of $\mathbb R^2$ , we associate their perpendicular bisector, which is a line through the origin and thus an element of $\mathbb R\mathbb P^1$ (if $x=y$ , we take the line through this point and the origin). This defines a map $Sym^2(S^1)\rightarrow \mathbb R\mathbb P^1$ , which is a fiber bundle with the interval as its fiber. By checking that this bundle is not orientable (i.e. going around $\mathbb R\mathbb P^1$ once flips the interval), we can see that it is a Möbius strip. (This argument—and a nice picture of the previous one—are included as §2.2 of this paper by Tuffley.) Hugh Morton ( summarized on nLab ): This is a case of Morton's more general description of $Sym^n(S^1)$ . Consider $S^1\subset \mathbb C$ as the unit circle and define a map $\text{Sym}^2(S^1)\rightarrow S^1$ by sending a pair $(x,y)$ to their product $xy.$ As in the previous proof, we can check that this is a fiber bundle with the interval as its fiber, and that this bundle is not orientable (i.e. going around $S^1$ once flips the interval), so it is a Möbius strip. Étienne Ghys: We can view $\mathbb R\mathbb P^2$ as the plane $\mathbb R^2$ with a copy of $\mathbb R\mathbb P^1$ at infinity. Then the Möbius strip $M$ is formed by cutting the open unit disk out of our projective plane. For any two points $p,q$ on the unit circle $S^1\subset \mathbb R^2$ , we can take the tangents $\ell_p$ and $\ell_q$ to the circle at these points. The map which sends $(p,q)\mapsto \ell_p\cap \ell_q$ is a homeomorphism $Sym^2(S^1)\rightarrow M$ , where the $\mathbb R\mathbb P^1$ at infinity corresponds to intersections of parallel lines. (I believe this is from “Prolongements des diffeomorphisms de la sphère,” but I am not certain.) Karanbir Sarkaria: We can view $\mathbb R\mathbb P^n$ as the space of non-zero, homogeneous polynomials of degree $n$ in $\mathbb R[x,y]$ , up to multiplication by a non-zero scalar. Then we have a map $\mathbb R\mathbb P^1\times \mathbb R\mathbb P^1\rightarrow \mathbb R\mathbb P^2$ , given by $$\big((rx+sy),(ux+vy)\big)\mapsto (rx+sy)(ux+vy).$$ This descends to a map $\text{Sym}^2(\mathbb R\mathbb P^1)\rightarrow \mathbb R\mathbb P^2$ , which is a homeomorphism onto its image. But $ax^2+bxy+cy^2$ lies in the image of this map if and only $b^2-4ac\geq 0$ . Hence, we must cut out from $\mathbb R\mathbb P^2$ the set of quadratics with complex roots, which is homeomorphic to the open disk. But removing a disk from $\mathbb R\mathbb P^2$ yields the Möbius strip, as desired. (See Sarkaria's note for a nice illustration of this fact.) Map a pair of points $\{p,q\}$ on the unit circle to their midpoint $(p+q)/2$ . This is a bijection between the punctured disk $D^2-{0}$ and pairs $\{p,q\}$ of non-antipodal points, but every pair of antipodal points gets mapped to $0$ . In other words, we can form $Sym^2(S^1)$ from $D^2$ by replacing the origin with a copy of $\mathbb R\mathbb P^1$ . This blowup of the disk is precisely a Möbius strip. (Again, I don't know where this argument originates.) The fact in question also relates to a fascinating result of Bott and Shchepin. Let $\exp_n(S^1)$ consist of all subsets of $S^1$ containing between 1 and $n$ points. This is topologized via the Hausdorff metric on compact subspaces of $S^1$ .

I don't know where the idea originates, but it is a neat elementary result in topology, which has a beautiful application in Vaughan's proof of the rectangular peg problem ( 3blue1brown gives a really nice account of this ). Inspired by a talk I saw on related results, I've been trying to compile a list of proofs that the symmetric square of is a Möbius strip. To be specific, the space is constructed from by identifying for every and taking the quotient topology. Hence, I am asking this question as community wiki, to try and learn of other peoples' favorite ways to prove this result. A quick ground rule: if someone beats you to the chase on your favorite proof, maybe comment to show your preference for it, rather than posting the same proof again? But if you have a proof that seems like a close variant of one already posted, feel free to post it! Since these are all about the same result, there are bound to be variations on the same idea. Also, if you know where your proof comes from, please give proper credit to its originator. If the proof is your own, be explicit about that fact, so that I can make sure to give you proper credit if I ever cite it elsewhere. Here are summaries of some proofs that I know of, to get the ball rolling: View the torus as square with opposite sides identified. The identification corresponds to folding the square along its diagonal, so we get a triangle with gluing between two adjacent sides. A brief cut-and-paste argument turns this into the usual presentation of the Möbius strip. (I don't know where this argument originates.) Charles Livingston: To any pair of points in the unit circle of , we associate their perpendicular bisector, which is a line through the origin and thus an element of (if , we take the line through this point and the origin). This defines a map , which is a fiber bundle with the interval as its fiber. By checking that this bundle is not orientable (i.e. going around once flips the interval), we can see that it is a Möbius strip. (This argument—and a nice picture of the previous one—are included as §2.2 of this paper by Tuffley.) Hugh Morton ( summarized on nLab ): This is a case of Morton's more general description of . Consider as the unit circle and define a map by sending a pair to their product As in the previous proof, we can check that this is a fiber bundle with the interval as its fiber, and that this bundle is not orientable (i.e. going around once flips the interval), so it is a Möbius strip. Étienne Ghys: We can view as the plane with a copy of at infinity. Then the Möbius strip is formed by cutting the open unit disk out of our projective plane. For any two points on the unit circle , we can take the tangents and to the circle at these points. The map which sends is a homeomorphism , where the at infinity corresponds to intersections of parallel lines. (I believe this is from “Prolongements des diffeomorphisms de la sphère,” but I am not certain.) Karanbir Sarkaria: We can view as the space of non-zero, homogeneous polynomials of degree in , up to multiplication by a non-zero scalar. Then we have a map , given by This descends to a map , which is a homeomorphism onto its image. But lies in the image of this map if and only . Hence, we must cut out from the set of quadratics with complex roots, which is homeomorphic to the open disk. But removing a disk from yields the Möbius strip, as desired. (See Sarkaria's note for a nice illustration of this fact.) Map a pair of points on the unit circle to their midpoint . This is a bijection between the punctured disk and pairs of non-antipodal points, but every pair of antipodal points gets mapped to . In other words, we can form from by replacing the origin with a copy of . This blowup of the disk is precisely a Möbius strip. (Again, I don't know where this argument originates.) The fact in question also relates to a fascinating result of Bott and Shchepin. Let consist of all subsets of containing between 1 and points. This is topologized via the Hausdorff metric on compact subspaces of . Bott showed that ("" On the third symmetric potency of "") and Schepin showed that the natural embedding is a trefoil knot (unpublished).

33,Discrete Polynomial Ham-Sandwich Theorem proof,Discrete Polynomial Ham-Sandwich Theorem proof,,"Discrete Polynomial Ham-Sandwich Theorem: Consider an algebraic hypersurface of degree $k$ in $\Bbb R^n$ ; let $Q$ be a polynomial of degree $k$ in $n$ variables. Define $m := \binom {n + k} {n}$ - 1. Let $A_1, \ldots, A_m$ be disjoint finite sets in $\Bbb R^n$ . Then there exists $Q$ s.t. $$ \forall i \in [m], \quad \left| A_i \cap \{ Q<0 \} \right|, \left| A_i \cap \{ Q > 0 \} \right| \le \frac {\left| A_i \right|} 2 $$ Proof: I read a proof sketch for the Discrete Ham-Sandwich Theorem (see at the bottom) in which the ""cutting""/bisecting surface is (degenerate to) only being a hyperplane (rather than an algebraic hypersurface). In this proof I got familiar with the ""trick of balls with volume"" (do you have a better name for that?). My question is why not using the same ""trick of balls with volume"" to reduce the discrete case into the continuous case (in which $A_1, \ldots, A_m \subset \Bbb R^n$ are disjoint bounded open sets), to which I already have a proof sketch (see below)? Thank you. Proof sketch for Continuous Polynomial Ham-Sandwich Theorem: Let $Q$ be a polynomial of degree $k$ in $n$ variables. We want to show that $\exists Q$ s.t. $$ \forall i \in [m], \quad vol \left( A_i \cap \{ Q<0 \}\right) = vol \left( A_i \cap \{ Q > 0 \}\right) = \frac {vol(A_i)} 2 $$ Note that $m$ is the number of non-constant monomials in $n$ variables of degree $\le k$ . Thus we can make polynomials of degree $≤ k$ from points of the $m$ -sphere $\Bbb{S^m}$ by identifying the vector $b = (b_0 , \ldots , b_m) ∈ \Bbb S^m$ with the polynomial $Q_b$ whose coefficients are precisely the values $b_0 , \ldots , b_m$ . Define $f : \Bbb S^m \rightarrow \Bbb R^m$ as follows $$ f_i (b_0 , \ldots , b_m) = vol \left( A_i \cap \{ Q_b<0 \}\right) - vol \left( A_i \cap \{ Q_b > 0 \}\right) $$ In other words, the $i$ -th coordinate of $f$ measures how good the hyperplane $\{Q_b = 0\}$ is at bisecting the set $A_i$ ; In particular, this hyperplane bisects $A_i$ if and only if $f_i(b_0 , \ldots, b_m ) = 0$ . $f$ can be shown to be continuous using the dominated convergence theorem. Intuitively, if we vary $b_0 , \ldots , b_m$ by just a little bit, then the polynomial $Q_b$ will only change a little bit, which means that the location of its zero-set $\{Q_b = 0\}$ will only change a little bit, so the value of each $f_i$ will only change a little bit; then since every $f_i$ is continuous, we get that $f$ is continuous. Also, $f$ is odd since every coordinate satisfy $$ \begin{split} f_i(-b_0 , \ldots, -b_m ) &= vol \left( A_i \cap \{ Q_{-b}<0 \}\right) - vol \left( A_i \cap \{ Q_{-b} > 0 \}\right) \\ &= vol \left( A_i \cap \{ Q_{b} > 0 \}\right) - vol \left( A_i \cap \{ Q_{b} < 0 \}\right) \\ &= -f_i(b_0 , \ldots, b_m ) \end{split} $$ By the Borsuk–Ulam theorem, $\exists (a_0 , \ldots , a_m) ∈ \Bbb S^m$ s.t. $f (a_0 , \ldots , a_m) = 0$ . This implies that the hypersurface $\{Q_a = 0\}$ bisects each $A_i$ . Proof sketch for Discrete Ham-Sandwich Theorem: For each $i \in [m]$ we define $A_i'$ to be the set of balls of radius $\epsilon$ , centered around every point in $A_i$ , namely $A_i' := \bigcup_{x \in A_i} B(x, \epsilon)$ . We choose $\epsilon$ s.t. the hyperplane intersects in total at most $n$ balls. Therefore whenever $n$ is odd, we know that on one hand the hyperplane must intersect at least one ball for each $A_i'$ , but on the other hand it can't intersect more than $n$ balls; concluding that the hyperplane intersect exactly one ball for each $A_i'$ , and by symmetry the hyperplane must pass through the ball's center in order to bisect its volume. It means that the hyperplane bisects the original $A_i$ as required. Otherwise (i.e $n$ is even), it's possible to remove any point, do what we did for odd $n$ , then return the point, since we are guaranteed that on each side of the hyperplane there won't be more than half of the points (after adding back the removed point).","Discrete Polynomial Ham-Sandwich Theorem: Consider an algebraic hypersurface of degree in ; let be a polynomial of degree in variables.

48,Geometric intuition behind this chain homotopy,Geometric intuition behind this chain homotopy,,"Warning: using Lee's Introduction to Topological Manifols notation in what follows. My question has to do with the chain homotopy that appears in Lee's Introduction to Topological Manifols and Rotman's Introduction to Algebraic Topology proofs that the inclusion $$C_\bullet^\mathcal{U}(X)\hookrightarrow C_\bullet(X)$$ Induces an isomorfism in singular homology $$H_p^\mathcal{U}(X)\cong H_p(X)$$ For all $p\geq 0$ . First, a series of definitions If $\alpha=A(v_0,\dots,v_p)$ is an affine singular $p-$ simplex in some convex set $K\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ and $w$ is any point in $K$ , we define an affine singular $(p+1)-$ simplex $w*\alpha$ called the cone on $\alpha$ from $w$ by: $$w*\alpha=w*A(v_0,\dots,v_p)=A(w,v_0,\dots,v_p)$$ And we extend this operator to affine chains by linearity: $w*\big(\sum_{i\in I}n_i\alpha_i\big)=\sum_{i\in I}n_i(w*\alpha_i)$ An important formula is proved in both references, regarding the relationship between the boundary and cone operators If $c$ is an affine chain, then $$\partial(w*c)=c-w*\partial c$$ It is obvious that if $c$ is a cycle, the last formula becomes $\partial(w*c)=c$ , and Rotman calls this an intrgration formula . Afterwards, both authors define an operator $s$ that sends affine $p-$ chains into affine $p-$ chains, called the barycentric subdivision operator . This is done by induction: For $p=0$ , $s=\text{Id}$ Suppose that $s$ has been defined for some $p\in\mathbb{N}$ . Then, for any affine $(p+1)-$ simplex $\alpha:\Delta_p\longrightarrow\mathbb{R}^n$ we set $$s\alpha=\alpha(b_p)*s\partial\alpha$$ Where $b_p$ is the barycentre of the standard singular simplex $\Delta_p$ , and we extend this operator to affine chains by linearity: $s\big(\sum_{i\in I}n_i\alpha_i\big)=\sum_{i\in I}n_is\alpha_i$ Now, to extend this operator to arbitrary singular chains, note that if $\sigma$ is a singular $p-$ simplex in any space $X$ , then $\sigma=\sigma_{\#}i_p$ , where $i_p:\Delta_p\longrightarrow\Delta_p$ is the identity map considered as an affine singular $p-$ simplex in $\Delta_p$ , and $\sigma_\#:C_\bullet(\Delta_p)\longrightarrow C_\bullet(X)$ is the chain map obtained from the continuous map $\sigma$ . So the idea is that if we have a singular chain $c$ , then applying sucesively the subdivision operator, we will obtain a chain homologous to $c$ , but whose simplices have images all lying in elements of $\mathcal{U}$ . To prove this, we should find a chain homotopy between the identity and the subdivision operator, that is, a homomorphism $h:C_p(X)\longrightarrow C_{p+1}(X)$ such that $$h\circ\partial+\partial\circ h=\text{Id}-s$$ But Lee and Rotman gives $$h\sigma=\sigma_\#b_p*(i_p-si_p-h\partial i_p)$$ And extend to chains by linearity. However, I am struggling to understand what geometric intuirion is behind this intriguing formula. I tried to draw what $h$ looks like when $\sigma=\text{Id}_{\Delta_1}$ , but it is really hard (impossible?) to imagine this acting on $2-$ simplices In contrast with the chain homotopy that appears in the proof of the homotopy axiom, this is really less intuitive, and relies heavily on what Rotman calls the integration formula . So my questions are How should we understand geometrically this map $h$ ? What is the geometric intuition that allows us to choose this a a good chain homotopy for our purposes? How should we understand the formula $\partial(w*c)=c-w*\partial c$ ? What is the meaning of this equation geometrically speaking? How to come up with such a map in the first place? How has this theorem developed historically? I understand perfectly both demonstrations, since the calculations are easy to follow; I am just concerned with how this map gives no intuition at first glance about the geometry involved.","Warning: using Lee's Introduction to Topological Manifols notation in what follows.

56,Countable order-dense subset in a linear order,Countable order-dense subset in a linear order,,"I ended up posting an answer to my own question, and I believe I knew this answer before I posted this question, but forgot about it.  At any rate, here it is for the record. My question is inspired by the following one by @lu_sin. Is there a countable order-dense family of open subsets of $(0,1)$? While I answered the above question (and my answer was accepted), the question remains open under a slightly different definition of order-dense, as indicated in the comments over there. While trying to answer the modified version of the question (which I believe ought to have something to do with $(0,1)$ being hereditarily Lindelöf and hereditarily separable), I came up with the following question. Let $(X,<)$ be a linear (same as total) order. Assume that: $(*)\ \ \ $ $X$ has no uncountable well-ordered subset (under the order induced by $<$ ), and no uncountable reverse well-ordered subset. Call a set $D\subseteq X$ order-dense in $X$ if whenever $\{x,y\}\subseteq X$ with $x<y$ then there is $z\in D$ such that $x\le z\le y$ . (Note that under this definition the integers are order-dense in themselves, which would not be the case if we required that $x<z<y$ . In that other question I find the version with $\le$ more difficult to answer, which is the reason I use $\le$ here.) Question . Assuming condition $(*)$ as above, is there a countable set $C$ which is order-dense in $X$ ? I could answer it under a certain ""local"" assumption, as explained below (but I think this assumption makes the answer rather easy, and I do not know the answer in general).  (On third reading I realized that I have a gap in the construction below, but I will leave  it as is for now, perhaps it illustrates some of the ideas I was thinking about.) Call an $x\in X$ $r$ -good (for right-good) if either (a) $x=\max X$ (if it exists), or (b) there is $x^+>x$ and a countable set $D=D(x,x^+)$ that is order-dense in $[x,x^+]$ . Analogously, call an $x\in X$ $l$ -good if either (a) $x=\min X$ (if it exists), or (b) there is $x^-<x$ and a countable set $D=D(x^-,x)$ that is order-dense in $[x^-,x]$ . If each $x$ in $X$ is good (i.e. both $r$ -good and $l$ -good) then the answer to the above question is yes.  Indeed starting with any $x_0\in X$ we could get an increasing countable transfinite sequence $S=\{x_\alpha:\alpha<\gamma\}$ for some $0<\gamma<\omega_1$ such that $\sup S=\sup X$ , and for each $\alpha$ there is a countable $D_\alpha$ order-dense in $[x_\alpha,x_{\alpha+1}]$ (except only if $x_\alpha=\max X$ ). Similarly, there  is a decreasing countable transfinite sequence $T=\{y_\alpha:\alpha<\delta\}$ for some $0<\delta<\omega_1$ such that $\inf T=\inf X$ , $y_0=x_0$ , and for each $\alpha<\delta$ there is a countable $C_\alpha$ order-dense in $[y_{\alpha+1},y_\alpha]$ (unless $y_\alpha=\min X$ ). Then we could let $C$ to be the union of all $D_\alpha,\alpha<\gamma$ , and  all $C_\alpha,\alpha<\delta$ (also throw in $S$ and $T$ and the endpoints of $X$ , if any).  There is a gap in the above argument, I was implicitly assuming that if $\alpha>0$ is limit then $x_\alpha=\sup_{\beta<\alpha}x_\beta$ (and similarly $y_\alpha=\inf_{\beta<\alpha}y_\beta$ .) If $\alpha>0$ is limit and $\sup_{\beta<\alpha}x_\beta$ is a gap of $X$ (i.e. $\sup_{\beta<\alpha}x_\beta$ does not exist in $X$ because $X$ is not complete) then I do not know how I want to define $x_\alpha$ . The answer is likely to be known, I would be grateful for a reference too. Extra comments on condition $(*)$ .  For the record, condition $(*)$ was first stated as follows.  For every $Y\subseteq X$ there is a countable (finite allowed) $Z\subseteq Y$ such that $\sup Y=\sup Z$ and there is a countable $W\subseteq Y$ such that $\inf Y=\inf W$ . (Note that we may replace $Z$ with $Z\cup W$ and require, equivalently, that for every $Y\subseteq X$ there is a countable $Z\subseteq Y$ such that $\sup Y=\sup Z$ and $\inf Y=\inf Z$ .) It seems we could drop the requirement that $Z\subseteq Y$ and $W\subseteq Y$ . Just require that for every $Y\subseteq X$ there is a countable (finite allowed) $Z$ such that $\sup Y=\sup Z$ and there is a countable $W$ such that $\inf Y=\inf W$ . Then I edited it as I realized:  I may have made things more complicated than necessary, will think, perhaps I should have just said that $X$ has no subset that is order-isomorphic to $\omega_1$ , or reverse order-isomorphic to $\omega_1$ . One example of a set that satisfies condition $(*)$ is the open unit interval $(0,1)$ with the usual order $\le$ . Another example (related to the question that was linked): If $X=\mathcal V$ where $\mathcal V$ is a nested collection of open subsets of $(0,1)$ (i.e. a linear order under set-inclusion), then $\mathcal V$ satisfies condition $(*)$ , which could be shown (I believe) using that $(0,1)$ is hereditarily Lindelöf and hereditarily separable. I realize I could have stated my question in yet another different, and apparently more general way (closer to the statement of the linked question). Suppose $P$ is a partial order and $X$ is a subset which is a chain, i.e. a linear order (under the induced order from $P$ ). Call a set $D\subseteq P$ dense in $X$ (where we do not require that $D\subseteq X$ ) if whenever $\{x,y\}\subseteq X$ with $x<y$ then there is $z\in D$ such that $x\le z\le y$ . Question. If $X$ satisfies condition $(*)$ above, is there a countable set $C\subseteq P$ which is order-dense in $X$ (where we do not require that $C\subseteq X$ )? I tend to believe that the two versions of the question are equivalent, but did not attempt to verify all details. Here is a related example, let $\mathcal V=\{(-x,x):0<x<1\}$ , a nested collection of open sets in $(-1,1)$ . Let $D=\{(-r,r):0<r<1, \ r\in\Bbb Q\}$ , where $\Bbb Q$ denotes the rational numbers. Then $D$ is countable and order-dense in $\mathcal V$ (under either definition). This question is such a mess ...

At any rate, here it is for the record. My question is inspired by the following one by @lu_sin. Is there a countable order-dense family of open subsets of $(0,1)$? While I answered the above question (and my answer was accepted), the question remains open under a slightly different definition of order-dense, as indicated in the comments over there. While trying to answer the modified version of the question (which I believe ought to have something to do with being hereditarily Lindelöf and hereditarily separable), I came up with the following question. Let be a linear (same as total) order. Assume that: has no uncountable well-ordered subset (under the order induced by ), and no uncountable reverse well-ordered subset. Call a set order-dense in if whenever with then there is such that . (Note that under this definition the integers are order-dense in themselves, which would not be the case if we required that . In that other question I find the version with more difficult to answer, which is the reason I use here.) Question . Assuming condition as above, is there a countable set which is order-dense in ? I could answer it under a certain ""local"" assumption, as explained below (but I think this assumption makes the answer rather easy, and I do not know the answer in general).  (On third reading I realized that I have a gap in the construction below, but I will leave  it as is for now, perhaps it illustrates some of the ideas I was thinking about.) Call an -good (for right-good) if either (a) (if it exists), or (b) there is and a countable set that is order-dense in . Analogously, call an -good if either (a) (if it exists), or (b) there is and a countable set that is order-dense in . If each in is good (i.e. both -good and -good) then the answer to the above question is yes.  Indeed starting with any we could get an increasing countable transfinite sequence for some such that , and for each there is a countable order-dense in (except only if ). Similarly, there  is a decreasing countable transfinite sequence for some such that , , and for each there is a countable order-dense in (unless ).

Here is my Math SE post on Part (b) of this particular problem. My Attempt: We recall that the set $K$ is given by $$ K = \left\{ \ 1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{4}, \ldots \ \right\}, \tag{Definition 0}$$ and the $K$ -topology on the set $\mathbb{R}$ of real numbers is the topology having as a basis all the open intervals $(a, b)$ , where $a \in \mathbb{R}$ , $b \in \mathbb{R}$ , and $a < b$ , together with all the sets of the form $(a, b) \setminus K$ . And, set $\mathbb{R}$ with the $K$ -topology is denoted by $\mathbb{R}_K$ . [Please refer to Sec. 13 in Munkres, specifically the Definition preceding Lemma 13.4.] Part (a): In this part, we will be using Lemma 26.1 in Munkres. Let $\mathscr{A}$ be the following covering of $[0, 1]$ by sets open in $\mathbb{R}_K$ . $$ \mathscr{A} \colon= \big\{ \ (-1, 2) \setminus K \ \big\} \bigcup \left\{ \ \left( \frac{1}{n+1}, 2\right) \ \colon \ n \in \mathbb{N} \ \right\}. $$ [Refer to (Definition 0) above.] We note that there is no finite sub-collection of $\mathscr{A}$ that could possibly cover the entire closed interval $[0, 1]$ . PS: In order to verify the assertion in the preceding paragraph, let us consider any finite sub-collection of the open covering $\mathscr{A}$ , say, the sub-collection $$ \mathscr{A}^\prime \colon=  \big\{ \ (-1, 2) \setminus K \ \big\} \bigcup \left\{ \ \left( \frac{1}{n_1 + 1}, 2\right), \ldots, \left( \frac{1}{n_k + 1}, 2\right) \ \right\},  $$ where $n_1, \ldots, n_k$ are distinct natural numbers. Then we find that $$ \bigcup_{S \in \mathscr{A}^\prime} S = \big( \, (-1, 2) \setminus K \, \big) \cup \left( \frac{1}{n_0+1}, 2 \right), $$ where $$ n_0 \colon= \max \left\{ n_1, \ldots, n_k \right\}. $$ Thus, for example, $$ \frac{1}{n_0+2} \in [0, 1] \setminus \bigcup_{S \in \mathscr{A}^\prime} S. $$ Therefore no finite sub-collection $\mathscr{A}^\prime$ of $\mathscr{A}$ can cover $[0, 1]$ as a subspace of $\mathbb{R}_K$ . Hence $[0, 1]$ is not compact as a subspace of $\mathbb{R}_K$ . Is this proof correct? Part (c): First, here is the definition of a topological space to be path connected. Given points $x$ and $y$ of a topological space $X$ , a path in $X$ from $x$ to $y$ is a continuous map $f \colon [a, b] \to X$ of some closed interval in the real line into $X$ , such that $f(a) = x$ and $f(b) = y$ . A topological space $X$ is said to be path connected if every pair of points of $X$ can be joined by a path in $X$ . Please refer to Sec. 24 in Munkres, specifically the Definition preceding Example 3. Suppose that $\mathbb{R}_K$ is path connected. Then there is a path in $\mathbb{R}_K$ from  point $x = 0$ to point $y = 1$ ; that is, for some closed interval $[a, b]$ on the real line, there exists a continuous mapping $f \colon [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}_K$ such that $f(a) = 0$ and $f(b) = 1$ . We note that the closed interval $[a, b]$ is both connected and compact as a subspace of the topological space $\mathbb{R}$ (i.e. the set $\mathbb{R}$ of real numbers with the standard, or usual, topology). [Please refer to Corollary 24.2 and Corollary 27.2 in Munkres.] Now as the closed interval $[a, b]$ is both connected and compact as a subspace of $\mathbb{R}$ and as $f$ is a continuous mapping of $[a, b]$ into $\mathbb{R}_K$ , so the image $f\big([a, b]\big)$ is also connected and compact as a subspace of $\mathbb{R}_K$ . [Please refer to Theorems 23.5 and 26.5 in Munkres.] Thus as a subspace of $\mathbb{R}_K$ , the set $f\big( [a, b] \big)$ is both compact and connected, and $f(a) = 0$ and $f(b) = 1$ . Let $y$ be any real number in the open interval $(0, 1)$ . Now as $[a, b]$ is connected, as $f \colon [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}_K$ is continuous, and as $f(a) = 0$ and $f(b) = 1$ , so there exists a real number $c \in (a, b)$ such that $f(c) = y$ , by the intermediate-value theorem (i.e. Theorem 24.3 in Munkres). Thus we have shown that $$ [0, 1] \subset f\big( [a, b] \big). \tag{1} $$ PS: The argument in the preceding paragraph is flawed, as has been pointed out in one of the comments below. So here is the correct argument: Let $y$ be any real number in the open interval $(0, 1)$ . Suppose that there is no $r \in [a, b]$ for which $f(r) = y$ . As $(-\infty, y) \cup (y, \infty) = \mathbb{R}\setminus \{ y \}$ and as $y \not\in f\big([a, b]\big)$ , so we find that $$ \big(\, (-\infty, y) \cap f\big([a, b]\big) \, \big) \cup \big( \, (y, +\infty)\cap f\big([a, b]\big) \, \big) = \big( \mathbb{R} \setminus \{y \} \big) \cap f\big([a, b]\big) = f\big([a, b]\big).   $$ Now as the unbounded open intervals $(-\infty, y)$ and $(y, +\infty)$ are open in $\mathbb{R}_K$ , so the sets $(-\infty, y)\cap f\big([a, b]\big)$ and $(y, +\infty)\cap f\big([a, b]\big)$ are open in the subspace $f\big([a, b]\big)$ of $\mathbb{R}_K$ . Moreover, the sets $(-\infty, y)\cap f\big([a, b]\big)$ and $(y, +\infty)\cap f\big([a, b]\big)$ are disjoint . Thus the disjoint open sets $(-\infty, y)\cap f\big([a, b]\big)$ and $(y, +\infty)\cap f\big([a, b]\big)$ form a separation of $f\big([a, b]\big)$ . But this contradicts the fact that $f\big([a, b]\big)$ is connected . Thus there does not exist any real number $y \in (0, 1)$ for which there is no $r \in [a, b]$ such that $f(r) = y$ . That is, for any real number $y \in (0, 1)$ , we have $y = f(r)$ for at least one $r \in [a, b]$ . Moreover, as $f(a) = 0$ and $f(b) = 1$ , so we conclude that $$ [0, 1] \subset f\big([a, b]\big). $$ Now as the closed interval $[0, 1]$ is a closed subset of $\mathbb{R}_K$ and as $[0, 1] \subset f\big( [a, b] \big)$ , so $$[0, 1] = [0, 1] \cap f \big( [a, b] \big),$$ and thus $[0, 1]$ is also a closed subset of $f \big( [a, b] \big)$ . [Please refer to Theorem 17.2 in Munkres.] And, as $f\big([a, b]\big)$ is compact and as $[0, 1]$ is a closed subspace of $f\big([a, b]\big)$ , so $[0, 1]$ is also compact as a subspace of $f\big([a, b]\big)$ , by Theorem 26.2 in Munkres. Finally, as $[0, 1]$ is a compact subspace of $f\big([a, b]\big)$ and as $f \big([a, b]\big)$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}_K$ , so $[0, 1]$ is also compact as a subspace of $\mathbb{R}_K$ . But this contradicts the fact $[0, 1]$ is NOT compact as a subspace of $\mathbb{R}_K$ , as we have shown in Part (a) above. Thus our supposition that $\mathbb{R}_K$ is path connected is wrong. Hence $\mathbb{R}_K$ is not path connected. Is this proof correct? Are both proofs given above correct and clear enough in each and every detail? Or, are there any point(s) in either of these where there are issues or errors?","Here is Prob. 3, Sec. 27, in the book Topology by James R.

PS: In order to verify the assertion in the preceding paragraph, let us consider any finite sub-collection of the open covering , say, the sub-collection where are distinct natural numbers. Then we find that where Thus, for example, Therefore no finite sub-collection of can cover as a subspace of . Hence is not compact as a subspace of . Is this proof correct? Part (c): First, here is the definition of a topological space to be path connected. Given points and of a topological space , a path in from to is a continuous map of some closed interval in the real line into , such that and . A topological space is said to be path connected if every pair of points of can be joined by a path in . Please refer to Sec. 24 in Munkres, specifically the Definition preceding Example 3. Suppose that is path connected. Then there is a path in from  point to point ; that is, for some closed interval on the real line, there exists a continuous mapping such that and . We note that the closed interval is both connected and compact as a subspace of the topological space (i.e. the set of real numbers with the standard, or usual, topology). [Please refer to Corollary 24.2 and Corollary 27.2 in Munkres.] Now as the closed interval is both connected and compact as a subspace of and as is a continuous mapping of into , so the image is also connected and compact as a subspace of . [Please refer to Theorems 23.5 and 26.5 in Munkres.] Thus as a subspace of , the set is both compact and connected, and and . Let be any real number in the open interval . Now as is connected, as is continuous, and as and , so there exists a real number such that , by the intermediate-value theorem (i.e. Theorem 24.3 in Munkres). Thus we have shown that PS: The argument in the preceding paragraph is flawed, as has been pointed out in one of the comments below. So here is the correct argument: Let be any real number in the open interval . Suppose that there is no for which . As and as , so we find that Now as the unbounded open intervals and are open in , so the sets and are open in the subspace of . Moreover, the sets and are disjoint . Thus the disjoint open sets and form a separation of . But this contradicts the fact that is connected . Thus there does not exist any real number for which there is no such that . That is, for any real number , we have for at least one . Moreover, as and , so we conclude that Now as the closed interval is a closed subset of and as , so and thus is also a closed subset of . [Please refer to Theorem 17.2 in Munkres.] And, as is compact and as is a closed subspace of , so is also compact as a subspace of , by Theorem 26.2 in Munkres. Finally, as is a compact subspace of and as is a subspace of , so is also compact as a subspace of . But this contradicts the fact is NOT compact as a subspace of , as we have shown in Part (a) above. Thus our supposition that is path connected is wrong. Hence is not path connected.

Let us say that $g$ is a potential derivative of $f$ if $g(x_0)$ is a potential derivative of $f$ at $x_0$ for all $x\in F$ . Then, a function $f$ is potentially $C^\infty$ on $F$ if there exists a sequence $(g_n)$ such that $f = g_0$ , $g_{n+1}$ is a potential derivative of $g_n$ for all $n\in \mathbf{N}$ . Remark that the potential derivative is unique if $x_0 \in F$ is not isolated (it is just the limit of the newton difference quotient).

Claim: Let $X$ and $Y$ be locally compact topological spaces, and $f : X \longrightarrow Y$ a continuous map. Suppose that $W \subset X$ is a relatively compact set. Then the induced map (obtained by restricting $f$ ) $$f : W \backslash f^{-1}(f(\partial W)) \longrightarrow Y \backslash f(\partial W)$$ is a proper map, i.e., the preimage of compact set in $Y \backslash f(\partial W)$ is a compact set in $W \backslash f^{-1}(f(\partial W))$ . Proof : Let $K \subset Y \backslash f(\partial W)$ be a compact set, we need to show that $f^{-1}(K)$ is a compact set in $W \backslash f^{-1}(f(\partial W))$ . By the continuity of $f$ , the preimage $f^{-1}(K)$ is closed, so we need only show that $f^{-1}(K)$ does not intersect the boundary of $W \backslash f^{-1}(f(\partial W))$ . There are two boundaries  to check: (i) $f^{-1}(K) \cap \partial W = \emptyset$ , and (ii) $f^{-1}(K) \cap f^{-1}(f(\partial W)) = \emptyset$ .

My Attempt: First of all, we note that $\mathbb{R}_l$ denotes the set of real numbers with the topology having as a basis all the open intervals of the form $(a, b) = \{ \ x \in \mathbb{R} \ \colon \ a < x < b \ \}$ , where $a$ and $b$ are any real numbers such that $a<b$ , and all the closed-open intervals $[c, d) = \{ c \} \cup (c, d)$ , where $c$ and $d$ are any real numbers such that $c < d$ . Refer to Sec. 13 in Munkres. Now let $A$ be a set in $\mathbb{R}_l$ consisting of more than one points. Let $a, b \in A$ such that $a < b$ . Then $a \in (-\infty, b)$ and $b \in [b, +\infty)$ ; these two rays are disjoint and their union is all of $\mathbb{R}$ ; moreover these rays are open in $\mathbb{R}_l$ . So $A \cap (-\infty, b)$ and $A \cap [b, +\infty)$ is a separation of $A$ . Thus $A$ is not connnected.

In other words, the only nonempty connected  sets in $\mathbb{R}_l$ are the singleton sets of real numbers. Since each component of $\mathbb{R}_l$ must be connected [Refer to Theorem 25.1 in Munkres.], we can conclude from the preceding paragraph that each component of $\mathbb{R}_l$ is a singleton set. And, since each path component of $\mathbb{R}_l$ must be contained in a component [Refer to Theorem 25.5 in Munkres.], we can conclude from the preceding paragraph that each path component of $\mathbb{R}_l$ must be a singleton set too. Finally let the map $f \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}_l$ be continuous. Then since $\mathbb{R}$ is connected, so should be $f ( \mathbb{R})$ [Refer to Theorem 23.5 in Munkres.], and therefore $f ( \mathbb{R})$ must be a singleton set in $\mathbb{R}_l$ .

For each $y \in B$ the   point $(x,y)$ is in some open set $W$ in $\mathcal{O}$. Since $W$ is   open, we have $(x,y) \in U_y \times V_y \subset W$ for some open   rectangle $U_y \times V_y$.

87,Prove that Voronoi cells are path-connected,Prove that Voronoi cells are path-connected,,"Let we have a similarity function $d: \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$. It can be a metric, but not necessarily it. We introduce the natural generalization of Voronoi cells in terms of this similarity function. Let we have a finite set of $n$-dimensional vectors $X$. We call the Voronoi cell $R_k$ associated with the element $x_k \in X$ the following set $$ R_k = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n| d(x, x_k) < d(x, x_j)~\forall j\ne k \}$$ My question is: what property we have to require from $d(x,y)$ for all Voronoi cells be path-connected for all possible finite sets $X$? My conjecture is that this is in some way related to convexity $d(x,y)$. I can prove path-connectedness in some particular cases of $d(x,y)$. For example, if $d(x,y) = \|x-y\|_2$ then the border between two points is linear, so every Voronoi cells is a polyhedron is this case. Another easy case is linear functions. In this case let $u$ and $v$ be arbitrary points from one Voronoi cell $R_x$ for $x \in X$. So $d(x, u) < d(w, u)$ and $d(x, v) < d(w, v)$ for $\forall w \ne x$. Hence $$ d(x, tu + (1-t)v) < d(w, tu + (1-t)v),~t\in[0,1] $$ So the Voronoi cell is convex.

Since $U\setminus V$, $V\setminus U$ are both closed in $U\cup V$, we have that \begin{align*} A & := \left(((U'')^c \cap W) \cup (V\setminus U)\right)^c ,\\ B & := \left(((V'')^c \cap W) \cup (U\setminus V)\right)^c , \end{align*} are both open in $U\cup V$, with $U\setminus V \subseteq A$ and $V\setminus U \subseteq B$, and most importantly, $A\cap B = \emptyset.$",,['general-topology']
