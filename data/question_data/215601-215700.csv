How could I approach this if I don't know the coordinates of the perpendicular point? (or do I not need to?) In my diagram, the points a and b define the line, and point p is the point where I need to determine its distance (in meters) from the line. The current function is as follows: public static double PerpendicularDistance(TrackPoint pointA, TrackPoint pointB, TrackPoint pointP)     {         // Area = |(1/2)(x1y2 + x2y3 + x3y1 - x2y1 - x3y2 - x1y3)|   *Area of triangle         // Base = √((x1-x2)²+(x1-x2)²)                               *Base of Triangle*         // Area = .5*Base*H                                          *Solve for height         // Height = Area/.5/Base          double area = Math.Abs(.5 * (pointA.Lat * pointB.Lon + pointB.Lat * pointP.Lon +              pointP.Lat * pointA.Lon - pointB.Lat * pointA.Lon - pointP.Lat * pointB.Lon - pointA.Lat * pointP.Lon));         double bottom = Math.Sqrt(Math.Pow(pointA.Lat - pointB.Lat, 2) + Math.Pow(pointA.Lon - pointB.Lon, 2));         double height = area / bottom * 2;         return height;     }",,"['trigonometry', 'algorithms']"
