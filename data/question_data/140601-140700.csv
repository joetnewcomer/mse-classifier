Is there a more direct way to prove this limit? Consider the functions $f(x)=\frac{\tan^{-1}(\sqrt{1-x})}{\sqrt{1-x}}$ , $g(x)=\frac{\pi/2-\tan^{-1}(\sqrt{1-x})}{\sqrt{1-x}}$ . We write the power series: $$f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}{(s_n\pi-r_n)x^n},\qquad{g}(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}{(s_n\pi+r_n)x^n}$$ where computing the first few terms suggests that $r_n$ , $s_n$ are rational. Indeed, we have $\frac{\pi/4-\tan^{-1}(\sqrt{1-x})}{\sqrt{1-x}}=\frac{g(x)-f(x)}{2}=\sum{r_nx^n}$ , and $\frac{1/4}{\sqrt{1-x}}=\frac{g(x)+f(x)}{2\pi}=\sum{s_nx^n}$ . Using $\frac{d}{dx}[\tan^{-1}(\sqrt{1-x})]=-\frac{1}{2(2-x)\sqrt{1-x}}$ , we can use the power series for $\frac{1}{2-x}$ and $\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x}}$ to calculate the power series for $(\pi/4-\tan^{-1}(\sqrt{1-x}))$ , which consists of only rational coefficients. Combining this with the power series for $\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x}}$ gives: $$r_n=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{m=0}^{n-1}{\sum_{k=0}^{n-m-1}{\frac{{{2k}\choose{k}}{{2m}\choose{m}}}{(n-m)\cdot2^{k+m+n}}}}$$ We easily get $s_n=\frac{1}{2^{2n+2}}{2n\choose{n}}$ . Now, because no branch of $f(z)$ has singularities anywhere (the apparent singularity at $z=1$ is removable), the coefficients of the power series of $f$ must tend to zero. Hence $\lim_{n\to\infty}{\frac{r_{n+1}}{s_{n+1}}}=\pi$ , and the desired limit follows after simplifying. Notes: 1) It is easily shown that: $$s_n\pi-r_n=\int_{0}^{\pi/4}{\sin^{2n}{\theta}\,d\theta},\qquad{s}_n\pi+r_n=\int_{\pi/4}^{\pi/2}{\sin^{2n}{\theta}\,d\theta}$$ 2) The above proof actually shows: $$\lim_{n\to\infty}{\left(1+\frac{1}{2n+1}\right)\sum_{m=0}^{n}{\sum_{k=0}^{n-m}{\left[\frac{2^{n-m-k}}{n-m+1}\,\frac{{{2k}\choose{k}}{{2m}\choose{m}}}{{{2n}\choose{n}}}\right]}}}=\pi$$ which converges much faster than the given limit.","Consider the following limit: I cooked this up while playing around with power series (details below).

Motivation : I've got the following :  $$\lim_{n\to\infty}S(2^n)=\infty.$$ Proof : The point of this proof is that there exists a non-zero number between the ${m+1}^{th}$ digit and ${4m}^{th}$ digit. If  $$2^n=A\cdot{10}^{4m}+B, B\lt {10}^m, 0\lt A,$$ then $2^n\ge {10}^{4m}\gt 2^{4m}$ leads $n\gt 4m$. Hence, the left side can be divided by $2^{4m}$. Also, $B$ must be divided by $2^{4m}$ because ${10}^{4m}=2^{4m}\cdot 5^{4m}$. However, since $$B\lt {10}^m\lt {16}^m=2^{4m},$$ $B$ can not be divided by $2^{4m}$ if $B\not=0$. If $B=0$, then the right side can be divided by $5$ but the left side cannot be divided by $5$. Hence, we now know that there is a non-zero number between the ${m+1}^{th}$ digit and ${4m}^{th}$ digit. Since $2^n$ cannot be divided by $5$, the first digit is not $0$.

However, I've been facing difficulty for the $m=3$ case. I've got $\lim\sup S(3^n)=\infty$. Proof : Suppose that $3^n$ has $m$ digits. Letting $l=\varphi({10}^m)+n$, then  $$3^l-3^n=3^n(3^{\varphi({10}^m)}-1).$$ Since this can be divided by ${10}^m$, we know that the last $m$ digits of $3^l$ are equal to those of $3^n$. Hence, we get $\lim\sup S(3^n)=\infty$. However, I can't get $\lim\inf S(3^n)$. Can anyone help?

Question 1 :Is the following true? $$\lim_{n\to\infty}S(3^n)=\infty.$$ Question 2 :How about $S(m^n)$ for $m\ge 4$ except some trivial cases? Motivation : I've got the following :  $$\lim_{n\to\infty}S(2^n)=\infty.$$ Proof : The point of this proof is that there exists a non-zero number between the ${m+1}^{th}$ digit and ${4m}^{th}$ digit. If  $$2^n=A\cdot{10}^{4m}+B, B\lt {10}^m, 0\lt A,$$ then $2^n\ge {10}^{4m}\gt 2^{4m}$ leads $n\gt 4m$. Hence, the left side can be divided by $2^{4m}$.

The product , let's call it $P$ , of the areas of the regions enclosed by the curve and the x -axis, approaches $0$ as $n\to\infty$ . But then I discovered that if we magnify the curve so that the average area of the regions is always $2$ (for any $n$ ), then $P$ approaches 6.17966... as $n\to\infty$ .

Now everything is clear here except for: ""However the restriction of $f$ to $[a,b]$ is continuous from a closed interval to $\mathbb{R}$ and thus bounded. Contradiction."" Well I think know what Arthur is telling there: Because of the boundary there is always at least one function value that can't be taken twice by the function, e.g. just like the peak of $-x^2$. But that is exactly where I was stuck before I started researching that issue. Is it really possible to just say it the way Arthur did?

So on the intervals $[0,a)$ and $(b,1]$ our function cannot go any higher than zero. That means that $f$ should take every positive real value on the interval $[a,b]$. However the restriction of $f$ to $[a,b]$ is continuous from a closed interval to $\mathbb{R}$ and thus bounded. Contradiction."" Now everything is clear here except for: ""However the restriction of $f$ to $[a,b]$ is continuous from a closed interval to $\mathbb{R}$ and thus bounded. Contradiction."" Well I think know what Arthur is telling there: Because of the boundary there is always at least one function value that can't be taken twice by the function, e.g. just like the peak of $-x^2$. But that is exactly where I was stuck before I started researching that issue. Is it really possible to just say it the way Arthur did? I thought that I'd have to further somehow prove the statement that boundary leads to that contradiction. I hope that it is clear what I was trying to express here...

73,Does the dominant prime factor contribute about $62\%$ of the value of the logarithm of numbers?,Does the dominant prime factor contribute about  of the value of the logarithm of numbers?,62\%,"Let $n = p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\cdots p_k^{a_k}$ be the prime factorization of $n$ for some primes such that $p_i < p_{i+1}$ . We define the minor prime factor and the dominant prime factor of $n$ as the primes which has the smallest the largest contributions respectively to the value of $n$ . Clearly, the dominant and the minor prime factors of $n$ is not necessarily its largest and smallest prime factors. E.g.  if $n = 2^8 3^6 5^2 7^2$ then the largest and the smallest prime factors of $n$ are $7$ and $2$ respectively where as its dominant and the minor prime factors are $3$ and $5$ respectively since $3^6 = 729$ is greater than $2^8 = 256, 5^2=25$ and $7^2=49$ . Definition 1 : The minor prime factor of $n$ is defined as the prime factor $p_m$ such that $p_m^{a_m} \le p_i^{a_i}$ . Definition 2 : If a number as two or more distinct prime factors, then the dominant prime factor of $n$ is defined as the prime factor $p_d$ such that $p_d^{a_d} \ge p_i^{a_i}$ for any $i \ne d$ . Note : If a number has only one distinct prime factor then its minor and its dominant prime factors are the same i.e. $p_m = p_d$ . Since $\frac{a_1 \ln p_1}{\ln n} + \frac{a_2 \ln p_2}{\ln n} + \cdots + \frac{a_k \ln p_k}{\ln n} = 1$ we can say that each term in this sum is the contribution of the respective prime to the value of $\ln n$ and we can ask on and average what is the contribution of the minor/dominant prime to logarithm of a number. Let $p_d$ be the dominant prime factor of $n$ . Experimental data for all $n \le 4 \times 10^{8}$ and the average over several smaller intervals upto $10^{100}$ ; suggests that such that $$ \lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{1}{x}\sum_{n = 1}^x \frac{a_d\ln p_d}{\ln n} \sim 0.62 $$ Conjecture : The dominant prime factor contributes approximately $62\%$ of the value of the logarithm of natural numbers. Can this be proved or disproved?

Is there a similar expressible limit expression for $\pi$? There are a number of relevant limits at Pi: Limit representations but I can't think of how to express any of them using just four 4s. Note that proving the hypothesis in Repeated Factorials and Repeated Square Rooting would show that arbitrarily close estimates are possible for every number using just one 4, but without necessarily providing them explicitly. Note also that if we permit usage of the $\ln$ operator, then we can approximate any number using just three 4s. For example, the following is a sequence of four fours expressions whose limit is $a \geq 1$: $$a_n = \overbrace{\sqrt{\sqrt{\cdots \sqrt{- \frac{\ln ( \ln \overbrace{\sqrt{\sqrt{\cdots \sqrt{4}}}}^{\lfloor a^{2^n}\rfloor \textrm{ times}} / \ln 4 )}{\ln \sqrt{4}}}}}}^{n \textrm{ times}}$$",,"['limits', 'recreational-mathematics', 'puzzle', 'pi']"
98,Does $\displaystyle \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\sin\left(x \sin \left( \frac 1x \right) \right)}{x \sin \left( \frac 1x \right)}$ exist?,Does  exist?,\displaystyle \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\sin\left(x \sin \left( \frac 1x \right) \right)}{x \sin \left( \frac 1x \right)},"I was playing around with the function $f : \mathbb R \rightarrow \mathbb R$ , defined as follows. $$f(x) = \frac{\sin\left(x \sin \left( \frac 1x \right) \right)}{x \sin \left( \frac 1x \right)}$$ This function is undefined at $x = \frac{1}{n\pi}$ for all $n \in \mathbb N$ . Namely, this suggests $$\forall \delta > 0 : \exists x : 0 < |x| < \delta \wedge f(x) \text{ is undefined.}$$ I'm curious about $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} f(x)$ . If this value exists, say set $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} f(x) = L$ , we naturally must have that $$\forall \varepsilon > 0 : \exists \delta > 0 : 0 < |x| < \delta \Rightarrow |f(x) - L| < \varepsilon.$$ But, since $f$ is not defined for all $x$ in the set $0 < |x| < \delta$ , the conclusion $|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$ cannot always be guaranteed to hold. So, I'm inclined to say that the limit $L$ does not exist. That being said, the graph looks like this and based on the graph, $f$ appears to satisfy this inequality: $$\forall x : \frac{\sin x}{x} \leq f(x) < 1$$ Since $\displaystyle \lim_{x\rightarrow 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1$ , this suggests in a squeeze-theorem-esque way that $L$ ""wants"" to take the value $1$ , but of course we cannot actually apply the squeeze theorem here for the same reason that we couldn't apply the $\varepsilon$ - $\delta$ definition directly. So, my questions are: Is my analysis correct that $\displaystyle \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\sin\left(x \sin \left( \frac 1x \right) \right)}{x \sin \left( \frac 1x \right)}$ does not exist? Is there any looser definition of a limit in common use (say, ${\lim}^\star$ ) that would set $\displaystyle {\lim_{x \rightarrow 0}}^\star \frac{\sin\left(x \sin \left( \frac 1x \right) \right)}{x \sin \left( \frac 1x \right)} = 1$ in a way that captures the spirit of what I described above?","I was playing around with the function , defined as follows.
