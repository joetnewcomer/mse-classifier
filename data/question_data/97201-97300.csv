0,Holomorphic function on an annulus,Holomorphic function on an annulus,,Let $f$ be a holomorphic function on the set $U=\{z \in \mathbb{C}: 1 \leq |z| \leq \pi \}$ . Assume that $max_{|z|=1}|f(z)| \leq 1$ and $max_{|z|=\pi}|f(z)| \leq \pi^{\pi}$ . How to prove that $max_{|z|=e}|f(z)| \leq e^{\pi}$ ? Usually in such exercises one considers $g(z)$ of the form $\alpha z^nf(z)$ where $\alpha$ and $n$ are such that our assumptions on $f$ gives $|g(z)| \leq 1$ on both circles being the boundary of $U$ . However it is not guarantedd that $n$ would be integer thus in general we don't get a holomorphic function $g$ for which we could apply the maximum principle. If $n$ happens to be rational one can overcome this difficulty by considering $(\alpha z^n f(z))^q$ where $n=\frac{p}{q}$ . However in our example $n$ turns out to be $\pi$ and by considering $g(z)=f(z)/z^{\pi}$ we don't get holomorphic function. How to handle this case?,Let be a holomorphic function on the set .

20,A contour integral and the residue theorem for infinitely many singularities,A contour integral and the residue theorem for infinitely many singularities,,"Consider the following integral $$\int_0^{\infty}\frac{1}{1+x^\alpha}dx, $$ where $\alpha > 1$. In the case where $\alpha$ is an integer, one can show, as I do below, that the integral evaluates to $\frac{\pi}{\alpha}\csc(\pi/\alpha)$. However, I think the integral evaluates to the same expression even for non-integer $\alpha$. I distinctly recall checking this on wolfram alpha, but now the calculation seems to require additional computation time, which I don't have. Maybe someone can check? Anyway, for integer $\alpha = n \geq 2$, let $$f(z) = \frac{1}{1+z^\alpha} = \frac{1}{1+z^n}, $$ and consider the contour integral $$\int_{\gamma}f(z)dz, $$ where $\gamma$ is a wedge shaped contour of radius $R$, opening angle $2\pi/n$ and one of its sides on the $x$-axis (I hope this is clear!).

96,Prove that $f \in C^k$ if $|\hat{f}(n)|\leq C/|n|^{k+a}$,Prove that  if,f \in C^k |\hat{f}(n)|\leq C/|n|^{k+a},"I'm looking at some problems related to Fourier series. This one stumped me a little. Suppose that $f$ is $2\pi$-periodic and piecewise smooth. Show that if   there exist $k \in \mathbb{N}, a > 0,$ and $C > 0$ such that   $$|\hat{f}(n)|\leq \frac{C}{|n|^{k+a}},$$ for $n \geq N_0$, then $f  \in C^k$. Note that $\hat{f}(n)$ is the Fourier coefficients of $f$. I really seem to have no idea where to start with this one. I was thinking about using the expression for the Fourier coefficients $$\hat{f}(n) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi} f(t) \mathrm{e}^{-int}\, \mathrm{d}t$$ and bound it by $|\hat{f}(n)| \leq 1/2\pi \int_0^{2\pi} |f(t)|\, \mathrm{d}t$. But this throws the $n$ out of the question. Any ideas?","I'm looking at some problems related to Fourier series. This one stumped me a little.
