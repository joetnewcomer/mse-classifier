0,Roots of $x \cos{x}-1$ and $\cos{x}-x^{-1}$,Roots of  and,x \cos{x}-1 \cos{x}-x^{-1},To finding the roots of  $x \cos{x}-1=0$ we can write the equation as $$ f(x)=x \cos{x}-1=0 \to x \cos{x}=1 \to \cos{x}=\frac{1}{x} \to \cos{x}-\frac{1}{x}=u(x)-v(x)=g(x)=0 $$ The roots of $f(x)$ are exactly the same roots of $g(x)$. But $f(x)\ne g(x)$. How can it be correct? Edit: My question is: Can we always simplify the equation (changing $f(x)=0$ to $u(x)-v(x)=0$) to finding the roots? Edit 2: The main problem is that it is much easier to finding the roots graphically by writing $f(x)$ as difference between two functions $u(x)-v(x)$. Then the roots of $f(x)$ are the intersections of the two functions $u(x)$ and $v(x)$. Edit 3: The problem is NOT where the two functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)=u(x)-v(x)$ obtained from $f(x)$ by adding or multiplying in the right and left of $f(x)=0$ are defined. The problem is are the roots of $f(x)$ equal to the roots of $g(x)$ or intersections of the two functions $u(x)$ and $v(x)$? Are there counterexamples in which the the roots of $g(x)=u(x)-v(x)$ are not equal to original function $f(x)$? Edit 4: Can we eliminate $x/x$ from $(x \cos{x})/x=1/x$ to obtain $\cos{x}- (1/x)=0$ ? I think I shouldn't do that. But in my textbook the author does that.,To finding the roots of  $x \cos{x}-1=0$ we can write the equation as $$ f(x)=x \cos{x}-1=0 \to x \cos{x}=1 \to \cos{x}=\frac{1}{x} \to \cos{x}-\frac{1}{x}=u(x)-v(x)=g(x)=0 $$ The roots of $f(x)$ are exactly the same roots of $g(x)$.

54,Confusion over Directly Proving Surjectivity,Confusion over Directly Proving Surjectivity,,"I have a question related to the surjectivity of a function. I understand what surjectivity is, in the sense that, if $f:X\longrightarrow Y$, then $f$ is surjective if $\forall_{y\in Y}\exists_{x\in X}f(x)=y$, or simpler (using the image) $f(X)=Y$. My troubles seem to lie in actually proving that either of these hold. For most proofs that I've seen on surjectivity, if the function has an inverse, then they use that and plug it back into the formula for the function to establish that the function is indeed a surjection. This usually goes as follows: Ex) For $f:\mathbb R\longrightarrow\mathbb R$, $f(x)=\frac{1}{2}x$, you find $x=2y$ for some $x\in\mathbb R$, and say $f(2y)=y$ completes the proof. I know that, algebraically, plugging in $2y$ into $f$ gives $y$, but I don't understand how showing $f(2y)=y$ completes the proof. Is it related to the fact that all real numbers can be described as 2 times another real number? Second, the above hinges on the fact that $f$ has an inverse. What if $f$ doesn't have an inverse? Ex) $f:\mathbb R \longrightarrow \mathbb R$, $f(x)=x^3-x$ does not have an inverse, but if you graph it, it clearly is onto. In both cases, the second definition provided above, $f(X)=Y$, is extremely easy to understand, but it feels useless - almost as if you know that the image of the domain is equal to the codomain, then you wouldn't need to prove it's onto in the first place.

Prove that $f$ is one-to-one if and only if $f \circ h = f \circ k$ implies $h = k$, for every set $C$ and all choices of functions $h: C \to A$ and $k: C \to A$. Here is my work: Assume that $f$ is one-to-one and let $A = \{x_1, x_2\}$ for two arbitrary $x_1, x_2$. So we have $f(x_1) = f(x_1)$ and $x_1 = x_2$. Assume $h$ and $k$ are one-to-one.

If we substitute $h(z)$ and $k(z)$ into $x_1$ and $x_2$ respectively, we have $f(h(z)) = f(k(z))$. It follows $f \circ h = f \circ k$ implies $h = k$. Conversely, we assume that $f \circ h = f \circ k$. It follows $f(h(z_1))=f(k(z_2))$ follows $z_1 = z_2$. Hence we can conclude that $h$ and $k$ are one-to-one.
