0,The 'inscribed-circumscribed' 6 point circle,The 'inscribed-circumscribed' 6 point circle,,"Here is a construction I came upon recently: A'B'C' is the contact triangle. X( 1 ) is the Incenter. A'',B'',C'' are the midpoints of the sides of the contact triangle. A''',B''',C''' are the midpoints of the segments AX(1), BX(1), CX(1) . Then quadrilaterals A''A'''C''C''', B''B'''C''C''', A''A'''B''B''' are cyclic. Let Ob, Oa, Oc be the circumcenters of these 3 quadrilaterals. Finally by drawing circles with centers at Oa, Ob, Oc and passing through the incenter we get the ' inscribed-circumscribed' six point circle with its center at the midpoint of X(1) and X(3) - the point X(1385) in the ETC: There is an even easier way to get a smaller concentric six point circle: circumcircles of the quadrilaterals A''A'''C''C''', B''B'''C''C''', A''A'''B''B''' cut the sides of the triangle ABC at six concyclic points.

1,Partitioning the interior of Bean curve,Partitioning the interior of Bean curve,,"The bean curve is defined as $\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)^{2}=x^{3}+y^{3}$ in cartesian coordinates, $r=\left(\cos\left(\theta\right)\right)^{3}+\left(\sin\left(\theta\right)\right)^{3}$ in polar coordinates and $$\gamma(t) = \left(\left(\left(\cos\left(t\right)\right)^{3}+\left(\sin\left(t\right)\right)^{3}\right)\cos\left(t\right),\left(\left(\cos\left(t\right)\right)^{3}+\left(\sin\left(t\right)\right)^{3}\right)\sin\left(t\right)\right)$$ as parametric equation for $0\le t \le \pi$ . My aim is to partition the interior in smaller bean curves(just like in the figure). For instance, in the case of unit circle centred at origin, every point in the interior can be written uniquely as $(s\cos(\theta),s\sin(\theta))$ where $s$ is the distance of the point from origin and $\theta$ denotes the angle from the $x$ -axis. Thus the interior in this case is the union of smaller circles centred at origin. Is it possible to do the same for the bean curve? A few possibilities that don't work are $s\gamma(t)$ and $s\gamma(t)+\frac{s(1-s)}{2}(1,1)$ , because for every $0\le s \le1$ , $(0,0) = s\times \gamma(3\pi/4)$ and the same problem with the second one.

2,How close are birational surfaces to being isomorphic?,How close are birational surfaces to being isomorphic?,,"Birational geometry is extremely difficult for me to comprehend, because this type of transformation is so general and seems to preserve so little of the geometry. For example cubic surfaces are birational to hyperboloids, but the former class has 27 lines on it and the latter has infinitely many. I have little to no intuition regarding how birational maps behave geometrically and how one should ""imagine"" them, and would like to lessen that gap. Now, for algebraic curves the situation isn't so bad, because we have the theorem that two smooth birational algebraic curves are isomorphic. I'm looking for similar results regrading algebraic surfaces - results that give insight (at least in special cases) about how close birational surfaces are to being isomorphic. I find the above theorem about curves to be a nice result because isomorphism of algebraic varieties does preserve geometric properties reasonably well - like singularities, local structure (Puiseaux expansion) etc, so I just think about smooth birational curves as having the same shape and it seems enough. For surfaces however, there is a very rich theory concerned with birationally classifying them, but I can't seem to understand what is the importance of this theory, because I can't imagine what is ""similar"" about birational surfaces. Are there similar (probably partial) results concerning the relationship between birational equivalence and isomorphism of algebraic surfaces? (I'm aware that every birational map is a sequence of blow-ups and blow-downs, but I don't really understand from that how similar birational surfaces are.)","Birational geometry is extremely difficult for me to comprehend, because this type of transformation is so general and seems to preserve so little of the geometry.

Edit: As @Mirko suggested, we define random placement of the circles by picking points from a square of side length $l-2r$ concentric to the initial one from a uniform distribution and using each one as a center for a specific circle.

I have tried to divide the square into little square ""cells"" of side $2r$ such that each circle can exist in one of the cells and obtained an expression for the probability of $k$ circles to exist with no overlap.

12,How to show that the Billiard flow is invariant with respect to the area form $\sin(\alpha)d\alpha\wedge dt$,How to show that the Billiard flow is invariant with respect to the area form,\sin(\alpha)d\alpha\wedge dt,"Consider a plane billiard table $D \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ (i.e. a bounded open connected set) with smooth boundary $\gamma$ being a closed curve. Next, let $M$ denote the space of tangent unit vectors $(x,v)$ with $x$ on $\gamma$ and $v$ being a unit vector pointing inwards. We then define the billiard map $$ T : M \to M. $$ To understand the map $T$ , we consider a point mass traveling from $x$ in direction $v$ . Let $x_1$ be the first point on $\gamma$ that this point mass intersects and suppose that $v_1$ is the new direction of the mass upon incidence. Then $T$ maps $(x,v)$ to $(x_1, v_1)$ . We now introduce an alternate ''coordinate system'' describing $M$ . Parametrize $\gamma$ by arc-length $t$ and fix a point $(x,v) \in M$ . We can find $t$ such that $x = \gamma(t)$ and let $\alpha \in (0, \pi)$ be the angle between the tangent line at $x$ and $v$ . The tuple $(t, \alpha)$ uniquely determines the point $(x,v)$ in $M$ , and thus offers and alternative description of this space. My question is as follows: I want to show that the area form given by $$ \omega := \sin{\alpha}\,\mathrm{d}\alpha \wedge \mathrm{d}t $$ is invariant under $T$ . I found a proof of this invariance property proof in S. Tabachnikov's Geometry and billiards but I'm having some trouble understanding a critical part of the proof. If anyone can explain the proof to me (or provide me with another proof) I would highly appreciate it. An intuitive explanation is also appreciated, but I am looking for a rigorous proof if possible. We restate this theorem formally below and provide the proof as given by Tabachnikov. Theorem 3.1. The area form $ω = \sin α \,dα \wedge dt$ is $T$ -invariant. Proof . Define $f(t, t_1)$ to be the distance between $\gamma(t)$ and $\gamma(t_1)$ . The partial derivative $\frac{\partial f}{\partial{t_1}}$ is the projection of the gradient of the distance $\left\vert{\gamma(t)\gamma(t_1)}\right\vert$ on the curve at point $\gamma(t_1)$ . This gradient is the unit vector from $\gamma(t)$ to $\gamma(t_1)$ and it makes angle $\alpha_1$ with the curve; hence $\partial f/\partial t_1 = \cos{\alpha_1}$ . Likewise, $\partial f/\partial t = -\cos{\alpha}$ . Therefore, $$   \mathrm{d}f = \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} \mathrm{d}t + \frac{\partial f}{\partial t_1}\mathrm{d}t_1 = -\cos{\alpha}\,\mathrm{d}t + \cos{\alpha_1}\,\mathrm{d}t_1 $$ and hence $$ 0 = \mathrm{d}^2f = \sin{\alpha}\mathrm{d}\alpha \wedge \mathrm{d}t - \sin{\alpha_1} \mathrm{d}\alpha_1 \wedge \mathrm{d}t_1. $$ This means that $\omega$ is a $T$ -invariant form. The above proof is copied directly from the book. I have the following questions about his method: Is the domain of $f$ the set $M\times M$ ? In the proof, are we specifically considering $(t, \alpha)$ and $(t_1, \alpha_1)$ such that $T (t, \alpha) =(t_1,\alpha_1)$ ? I am having a hard time understanding how the author obtains $\partial f/\partial t_1 = \cos{\alpha_1}$ and $\partial f/\partial t = -\cos{\alpha}$ .

For a 2D case, I interpret this as being able to build a curve that traverses through a 2D plane by only using little $\Delta x$ ’s and little $\Delta y$ ’s.

The 3D torus is not of interest here. Consider the torus as a subset of $\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Then a line is what we would usually consider a straight line in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$, with the identification of edges possibly splitting the line into many segments bounded by the boundary of the torus. For example, the following (left) image is the line of gradient $4/3$ on the torus that passes through $(0,0)$. The right image is twelve tilings of the flat representation to show where each segment on the left comes from. A partitioning of the torus is an arrangement of lines on the torus. These lines must extend from boundary to boundary, as above. A triangular grid is a partitioning of the torus by three sets of parallel lines such that every vertex has degree $6$ and every face is a triangle. We may assume the lines to be horizontal, vertical, and of a rational slope if necessary. One example of a triangular grid is given below, followed by five partitions that are allowed on the torus. It is important that there are exactly three distinct gradients that the lines can have, and that the lines continue from boundary to boundary . For example, the flat representation of the {""Circulant"", {9, {1, 2, 3}}} graph (taken from Ed Pegg's answer below ) does not fit the requirements of a triangular grid as the lines do not have exactly three different gradients. This is not an allowed partition either as not all lines extend from boundary to boundary. Useful Identities Let every intersection of lines induce a vertex, let each line segment between connected vertices be an edge, and let the closed interior of at least two incident edges be a face. Let $V, E, F$ be the number of vertices, edges, and faces that the torus is partitioned into, respectively. It is well known that the Euler characteristic of the torus is zero, so $$ V - E + F = 0.\tag{1} $$ Let $d(v)$ denote the degree of the vertex $v$ (which must be even, by construction). It is also well known that summing the degrees of all vertices gives $$ 2E = \sum d(v).\tag{2} $$ Let $F_{s}$ denote the number of faces with $s > 1$ edges. When there are no loops in the graph, a simple counting argument shows that $$ 2E = \sum_{s \geq 2} sF_{s}.\tag{3} $$ It is also trivial that $F = \sum_{s \geq 2} F_{s}$.

Then   $$ E = 3V \qquad\text{and}\qquad F = 2V. $$ Proof. Every face has $3$ edges, so $F = F_{3}$. By $(3)$, we have $$ 2E = \sum_{s\geq 2}sF_{s} = 3F_{3} = 3F. $$ By $(1)$, we have $V - E + F = 0$ so that $3F - 3E = -3V$. We have a system of simultaneous equations, namely $$ 3F - 2E = 0 \qquad\text{and}\qquad 3F - 3E = -3V. $$ Solving this gives $E = 3V$ and $F = 2V$ as required.$\qquad\square$ My question is the following. Is the converse of the Lemma true? That is, if some partitioning of the torus has $V$ vertices, $E$ edges, and $F$ faces such that $E = 3V$ and $F = 2V$, then is it true that the partition is necessarily a triangular grid? I have not yet been able to find a counter-example. In the proof of the converse, I want to prove that $d(v) = 6$ for all vertices $v$, and that $F_{3} = F$ with $F_{i} = 0$ for all $i \neq 3$. I have noticed that we cannot have any faces with more than $6$ edges so that the $s$ index only runs between $2$ and $6$, but there still seem to be too many variables to do anything (namely, each of the vertex degrees and the five $F_{s}$ for $s \in [2, 6]\cap\mathbb{Z}$).","Definitions The torus that we consider is the flat representation given by the quotient $\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{Z}[i]$, or equivalently as the set $$ \tau = \{\, (x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^{2} : 0 \leq x, y \leq 1 \,\} $$ with the points $(x, y), (x+1, y), (x, y+1)$ identified.

If the angle is defined as such then we can show that $\alpha_0=(3- \sqrt{5}) \pi$. (All of the above is according to Wikipedia ). However, if we use the direct generalization of the common definition for the golden ratio for a line segment, we should be comparing areas instead of arc length. Thus, if $\alpha$ is the (new kind of) golden angle, we should define it using the segment area $A$ that we ""cut off"" by drawing the chord: $$A=\frac{1}{2} (\alpha-\sin \alpha)$$ $$\frac{A}{B}=\frac{B}{A+B}$$ We obtain a transcendental equation for the angle: $$\alpha-\sin \alpha=(3- \sqrt{5}) \pi=2(2-\phi) \pi$$ Numerically its value is: $$\alpha=2.7664077793984\dots=0.8805749453982892\dots \pi$$ I have not been able to find a closed form.

If the angle is defined as such then we can show that $\alpha_0=(3- \sqrt{5}) \pi$. (All of the above is according to Wikipedia ). However, if we use the direct generalization of the common definition for the golden ratio for a line segment, we should be comparing areas instead of arc length.

Both notions have a clear and simple geometrical meaning; the former represents the affine , the latter the metric, aspect of geometry... The axiom... is formulated entirely in terms of betweenness, and hence is useful in the construction of an axiom set for affine geometry .

Besides, if we inscribe a circle under it, its radius is exactly $R=\frac{1}{2}$ , so it takes exactly one fourth of the full area under the curve. Actually, I don't know an easy way to find $R$ even in this simple case. So, let's consider how I solve the more general problem. Find the largest circle fitting between the curve $y=y (x)$ and the line $y=0$ $$y(x)=\frac{1}{(1+x^2)^n}~~~~~~ n=1,2,3,\dots$$ The distance from the circle origin $(0,R)$ to the curve is the minimum of a function: $$s(x)=\sqrt{x^2+\left(R-\frac{1}{(1+x^2)^n} \right)^2}$$ $$s(x)'=0$$ The condition for the inscribed circle is $s(x)=R$ . Let's denote: $$t=1+x^2$$ Then from the above we obtain the system of equations: $$t^{2n+1}+2n~R~t^n-2n=0$$ $$t^{2n+1}-t^{2n}-2~R~t^n+1=0$$ This is how I got the solution for $n=1$ (using Mathematica).

However, it seems this kind of proof is fairly tedious (you have to check three cases in both implications), and relies on quadratic functions and radicals since you have to use the distance formula as that's how you'd define the ""betweenness"" relation for three points. I suppose the details would vary with regard to the axiom set we use (I don't know if Hilbert's would necessarily be the best for ""high school geometry"") -- but it seems no matter which one we use, we need some way to determine that three points A, B, and C ""lie on the same line"" (which is what the ""betweenness"" relation does, although it does more, since it also orders the points), and a way to express this with regards to coordinatized points as well as points in the axiomatic geometry which the coordinate plane models.

Lets assume the track is perfectly circular and I am running 2 metres to the outside, the extra distance I will run will be $2\pi r_{outside} - 2\pi r_{inside} = 2\pi (r_{inside}+2) - 2\pi r_{inside}$ $= 4\pi \approx 12m$ My first surprise is that regardless of the length of the lap, I will only ever do 12m more Would this formula hold for a non-circular track, e.g. oval or something even more complicated like the Suzuka Formula 1 circuit Note: I am not a mathematician and I apologise for the way I've asked the question.","I went for a run with a friend last night.

95,Demonstrating that a cycloid solves the Tautochrone Problem,Demonstrating that a cycloid solves the Tautochrone Problem,,"I've become stuck on a problem from my calculus textbook, while attempting some revision. The problem: I'm told that the following parametric equations describe an arc of a cycloid that is the solution to the Tautochrone Problem, that is to say that the time taken for an object to reach the bottom of the curve is independent of the objects starting point. (So long as we don't bring friction into the picture) $$x(\theta) = a(\theta - Sin(\theta));\\ y(\theta) = a(Cos(\theta)-1).$$ The question asks that verify that the curve is a solution to the Tautochrone Problem and provides the following two hints. The speed of an object (v) at $\theta$, that started from $\theta_{0}$, is given by $v = \sqrt{2g(y(\theta_{0})-y(\theta))}$ The transit time to the bottom of the curve (T) is given by the following integral, $$T = \displaystyle\int_{\theta_{0}}^\pi \frac{1}{v} ds$$ Where 's' is the arc length parameter for the curve. My attempt: So given the information above, and that this question is in a chapter on parametric curves, it seems that the only thing to do is determine a relationship between the arc-length parameter and the parameter given in the equations provided. So start by writing the position vector for any point on the curve as, $\boldsymbol{r}(\theta) = \left(x(t), y(t)\right)$ The arc-length (s) of the curve, on the interval $\left[\theta_{0}, \theta\right]$, is given by the integral. $$\begin{align} s & = \int_{\theta_{0}}^{\theta} \ \left|\frac{d \ \boldsymbol{r}}{d \ \tau}\right|d \ \tau \\ \\ \therefore \frac{d \ s}{d \ \theta} & = \left|\frac{d \ \boldsymbol{r}}{d \ \theta}\right| \end{align}$$ Returning back to our integral for the Transit time, we use the above to change the variable of integration. $$T = \displaystyle\int_{\theta_{0}}^{\pi} \frac{1}{v}\frac{ds}{d\theta}d\theta$$ $$\therefore T = \displaystyle\int_{\theta_{0}}^{\pi} \frac{1}{v}\left|\frac{d\boldsymbol{r}}{d\theta}\right|d\theta$$ Trouble is I get this horrible integral and i'm not sure that it would even show what I've set out to show. Or in other words i'm pretty sure i've gone wrong somewhere, or maybe i've just plain gone down the wrong track altogether. $$T = \sqrt{\frac{1}{ga}}\displaystyle\int_{\theta_{0}}^{\pi} \frac{2\sin\left(\theta/2\right)}{\left(2\cos(\theta_{0}) - 2\cos(\theta)\right)^{1/2}}\ d\theta$$ Edit: So turns out the integral is totally solvable with a simple trig identity that i had no idea about...","I've become stuck on a problem from my calculus textbook, while attempting some revision.

97,Proof for solar declination angle?,Proof for solar declination angle?,,"This geometry occurs in the definition of the angle of solar declination. Planes $X$ and $Y$ intersect along line $AF$. The angle between the two planes is defined as $a_0$ which is equivalently the angle $\angle BAC$. Now the side $AB$ is rotated to a new position denoted by $AD$ by an angle $p$ (or $\varphi$, but $p$ is what's in the image). The new angle $a_1 = \angle DAE$ is a function of $a_0$ and $p$. What is the expression for $a_1$ in terms of $a_0$ and $p$? Note that the angle $p = \angle DAB$, all of which points lie in plane $X$. The triangles $ABC$ and $ADE$ are drawn to show the geometry but are not required to define the problem. This problem occurs between Earth and the Sun as Earth rotates around the Sun. The angle $p$ is $0$ or $180^\circ$ at solstice. The angle $a_0$ is the maximum declination angle of $23.45^\circ$. An approximate answer appears to be $\sin(a_1) = \sin(a_0) \sin(90-p)$. How can this be proven? @Peter gave a rigorous vector based proof. The following is a geometry based proof. Please see if the logic is correct. . The geometry is constructed by choosing vectors AC and AE with unit length. Extended line CE meets AF at point Q. Once the triangles QAB and QBC are constructed as shown, the lengths of remaining sides are established using length/sin rule for a triangle. Observe that the rotation angle ""q"" instead of ""p"" is used to determine the lengths QE and EC. Then using similarity rule for triangles the ration of sides DE:BC is equated to QE:QC. The  trigonometric formula Cos(A-B)=CosA CosB + SinA SinB allows L1/(L1+L2) to be reduced to Cos(q). If the rotation angle ""p"" is referenced instead of ""q"" then the proof is repeated with vectors AB and AD with unit length. In this case the lengths of sides BC and DE becomes tan(a0) and tan(a1) which will results in tan(a1)=tan(a0)*cos(p). Does this make sense? @Peter any comment? Since angle p and q are not identical and they are linked to each other, the results makes sense. 9/20/2013  Simplest Geometry-based Proof: Please refer to the following figure. Objective is to link angles a0 and a1 to the rotation angle either ""p"" or ""q"". The angle between the two planes X&Y is defined as a0. Hence the plane ABC is normal to both planes X and Y. By rotating the plane ABC to a new plane ADE by amount ""p"" (defined by BAD in plane-X) or by amount ""q"" (defined by CAE in plane-Y) the new angle ""a1"" is obtained. Note that the plane BCED is generated by drawing it parallel to line AF while keeping it normal to plane-X. This generates the rectangle BCED. Once BCED is understood to be a rectangle the derivation of the relationship is simple as shown in the figure. In the definition of solar declination angle, plane-X encompasses the orbit of earth around the sun and is referred to as ecliptic plane. Plane-Y is the equatorial plane which is normal to the axis of rotation of the earth. In one year as earth orbits the sun, the angle ""p"" evolves from 0 through 360 degrees at a constant rate of 360/365.25 degrees per day. Note that angle ""p"" is zero when the earth axis is tilted towards the sun on June 21 (solstice) at a maximum of 23.45 degrees (=a0). It is of interest to estimate a1 vs. p as earth orbits the sun.
