1,Integrating $\log(-ix)\exp(-ix)/x^2$,Integrating,\log(-ix)\exp(-ix)/x^2,"I would like to compute a few integrals like $$\int_{-\infty}^\infty\frac{\log(-ix)\exp(-ix)}{x^2}\,dx$$ To be clear, here the path of integration is really $z = \epsilon i + x$ , so that it avoids the singularity at $x=0$ , and the branch cut of $\log$ . This expression is ""well-behaved"" in several ways: it falls off faster than $1/x^{3/2}$ on the real line, so it converges decently quickly; in fact, falls off quickly everywhere in the lower half-plane of $z$ . Exponentially quickly, thanks to the $\exp$ term. The function is holomorphic everywhere except the branch cut at $x\le 0$ , so I can deform it pretty easily. The $\log \exp / x^k$ form seems impossible to find an antiderivative for. So this seems like something that should be doable using Cauchy residue theorem and related tricks. The function grows quickly on the upper half plane, so I can't just deform it ""up and away"" and show that it's zero. One can easily reduce it to a keyhole contour around the branch cut, but neither the ""along the cut"" nor the ""around the pole"" term are zero, they both depend on the radius of the keyhole, and neither one seems solvable analytically.

I am trying to prove a similar result when we allow $f$ to take complex values, i.e. if $f$ is a continuous function from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{C}$ which satisfies $f(x+y)=f(x)f(y)$ for all $x,y \in \mathbb{R}$ , then there exists some $z\in \mathbb{C}$ such that $f(x)=e^{zx}$ . However, I am totally stuck after attempting a few different methods. In real analysis, the steps towards proving this result is: (1) Use induction to show that $f(x)=a^x$ is true for all $x\in \mathbb{Z}$ ; (2) Use $f(1)=(f(\frac{1}{n}))^n$ to show that $f(\frac{1}{n})=(f(1))^{\frac{1}{n}}$ , hence $f(x)=a^x$ is true for all $x\in \mathbb{Q}$ ; and (3) Use continuity to extend this to all $x\in \mathbb{R}$ . However, when we allow $f$ to take value in $\mathbb{C}$ , it seems that we're stuck at step (2), since every complex number has n distinct complex n-th roots and we do not know which one to choose for $f(\frac{1}{n})$ . We do have the additional assumption of continuity, but I don't quite see how it can be employed in this step.

In particular, $i(v,w)=(-w,v)$ . Complexification of map definition : See a question I posted previously . Proposition ( Conrad , Bell ): Let $f \in End_{\mathbb C}(V^{\mathbb C})$ . We have that $f$ is the complexification of a map if and only if $f$ commutes with the standard conjugation map $\chi$ on $V^{\mathbb C}$ , $\chi(v,w):=(v,-w)$ . In symbols: If $f \circ J = J \circ f$ , then the following are equivalent: Condition 1. $f=g^{\mathbb C}$ for some $g \in End_{\mathbb R}(V)$ Condition 2. $f \circ \chi = \chi \circ f$ I think Bell would rewrite Condition 2 as $f = \chi \circ f \circ \chi$ and say $f$ 'equals its own conjugate'. Questions: Considering the half of the above proposition that says ' $f$ commutes with both $J$ and $\chi$ implies $f$ is complexification of a map', what do we get if we instead have the following? commutes with $J$ and anti-commutes with $\chi$ ( $f \circ \chi = - \chi \circ f$ ) anti-commutes with $J$ ( $f \circ J = - J \circ f$ , i.e. $f$ is $\mathbb C$ -anti-linear) and commutes with $\chi$ anti-commutes with $J$ and anti-commutes with $\chi$ Motivation : $f=J$ satisfies the case in Question 1, and $f=\chi$ satisfies the case in Question 2.

I think $g^{anti-\mathbb C}$ turns out to always exist uniquely as $g^{anti-\mathbb C}(v,w)=(g(v),-g(w))$ . Then, I think the answer for Question 2 is that $f$ is the anti-complexification of a map.

This because the residue is defined to be the coefficient $a_{-1}$ of the Laurent series and therefore if the Laurent series has no negative terms there is no residue (or the residue is zero). However the situation on the Riemann sphere is different, that is to say it seems to me that the point at infinity might have a residue even without being a singularity. Take for example $f(z) = \frac{1}{z}$ . A simple calculation (using the definition) shows that the residue at infinity is -1. However, this function has a 0 at infinity and not a singularity.

I'm looking for something along the lines of ""of course the upper half-circle contributes zero because (short quip)"", similar to how I tell my students that the dependence of the implicit derivative on both and for a circle makes sense, since circles are not functions and we need both values to determine which point we are talking about. I am aware of this question: why does the circle at infinity not contribute the integral? but it dealt more with the specific problem than the general intuition, I feel. This question also exists, and is helpful: Intuitive reason for why many complex integrals vanish when the path is ""blown-up""? But I still think such intuition must exist somewhere, and found the answers there helpful, but not satisfying.","\dfrac{R^n}{R^m+\mathcal{O}(R^l)}, l<m n<m R\to\infty 0 x y","['integration', 'complex-analysis', 'contour-integration']"

34,When do a holomorphic function's zeroes occur in conjugate pairs?,When do a holomorphic function's zeroes occur in conjugate pairs?,,"I have the following proof that a holomorphic function's zeroes occur in conjugate pairs when its derivatives evaluated at $0$ lie on a line through $0$ : Let $f:\mathbb{C}\mapsto\mathbb{C}$ be holomorphic, then $$f(z)=\sum\limits_{r=0}^{\infty}\frac{f^{(r)}(0)}{r!}z^r.$$ Writing $z\equiv\cos(\arg(z))+i\sin(\arg(z))$ , and invoking De Moivre's theorem, we get $$\Re(f(z))=\sum\limits_{r=0}^{\infty}\frac{|z|^r}{r!}(\Re(f^{(r)}(0))\cos(r\cdot\arg(z))-\Im(f^{(r)}(0))\sin(r\cdot\arg(z))),$$ $$\Im(f(z))=\sum\limits_{r=0}^{\infty}\frac{|z|^r}{r!}(\Im(f^{(r)}(0))\cos(r\cdot\arg(z))+\Re(f^{(r)}(0))\sin(r\cdot\arg(z))).$$ Suppose $f^{(r)}(0)\in\mathbb{R}$ for all $r\in\mathbb{N}_0$ , then $\Im(f^{(r)}(0))=0$ for all $r$ , so $$\Re(f(z))=\sum\limits_{r=0}^{\infty}\frac{|z|^r}{r!}f^{(r)}(0)\cos(r\cdot\arg(z)),$$ $$\Im(f(z))=\sum\limits_{r=0}^{\infty}\frac{|z|^r}{r!}f^{(r)}(0)\sin(r\cdot\arg(z)).$$ Therefore, $\Re(f(z))$ is even with respect to $\arg(z)$ , and $\Im(f(z))$ is odd with respect to $\arg(z)$ , so $f(\overline{z})=\overline{f(z)}$ for all $z\in\mathbb{C}$ . Therefore, if $f(z)=0$ , $f(\overline{z})=0$ . Now let $f$ be such that its derivatives evaluated at $0$ lie on a line through $0$ such that $\arg(z)=\theta$ for all non-zero $f^{(r)}(0)$ , then $g(z)=e^{-i\theta}f(z)$ is such that $g^{(r)}(0)\in\mathbb{R}$ for all $r$ since $g^{(r)}(0)=e^{-i\theta}f^{(r)}(0)$ . Therefore, the zeroes of $g$ occur in conjugate pairs, and $f$ is simply a rotation of $g$ about $0$ , so the zeroes of $f$ occur in conjugate pairs. My question is, are there known results about curves $\gamma$ in $\mathbb{C}$ other than lines through $0$ such that any holomorphic $f$ such that $f^{(r)}(0)\in\gamma$ for all $r\in\mathbb{N}_0$ is such that, if $f(z)=0$ , $f(\overline{z})=0$ . I've looked around online and all I can find is the conjugate pair theorem, which is a special case of what I have already proven. A method I have tried of extending the class of curves that have this property is to note that, given some curve $\gamma$ and any sequence of points $(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ such that $a_n\in\gamma$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$ , if there exists some holomorphic $g$ such that $g^{(r)}(0)\in\mathbb{R}$ for all $r$ and some holomorphic $T$ such that $T(0)=0$ and $T(z)\neq 0$ for all non-zero $z\in\mathbb{C}$ , such that $(T\circ g)^{(r)}(0)=a_r$ for all $r$ , then any function whose derivatives evaluated at $0$ lie on $\gamma$ is such that it zeroes occur in conjugate pairs. I won't write out the whole proof, but I then used the combinatorial form of Faa De Bruno's formula to show that one has sufficient freedom in the choosing of the derivatives of $T$ and $g$ to conclude that there exists some $T$ and $g$ such that $(T\circ g)^{(r)}(0)=a_r$ for all $r\in\mathbb{N}$ , and, moreover, that there is even more freedom in the choosing than that; I have come close to proving that you can get $T(0)=0$ , but not that $T(z)\neq 0$ for all non-zero $z$ (in fact, this is definitely not true for all $\gamma$ , and I don't see how I will be able to distinguish between those curves for which it is true and those for which it isn't, even if I do make progress on determining what curves one has ""more freedom"" for), and was wondering if there are known results related to this.","I have the following proof that a holomorphic function's zeroes occur in conjugate pairs when its derivatives evaluated at lie on a line through : Let be holomorphic, then Writing , and invoking De Moivre's theorem, we get Suppose for all , then for all , so Therefore, is even with respect to , and is odd with respect to , so for all .

In this paper by Flajolet and Salvy, they use the series representation of the Digamma function and the fact that, if $p$ is a nonnegative integer, as $s\to p$, $$\psi(-s)+\gamma\sim \frac{1}{s-p}+H_p+...$$ to state that as $s\to p$, $$(\psi(-s)+\gamma)^2\sim \frac{1}{(s-p)^2}+\frac{2H_p}{s-p}+...$$ and so if $r(s)$ is a function with no poles or zeroes at the positive integers, $$\begin{align} \text{Res}\space\space (\psi(-s)+\gamma)^2 r(s)_{s=p} &= \text{Res}\space\space \frac{r(s)}{(s-p)^2}+\frac{2H_p\space r(s)}{s-p}_{s=p}\\ &= \text{Res}\space\space \frac{r(s)}{(s-p)^2}+\frac{2H_p\space r(s)}{s-p}\\ &= \lim_{s\to p} \frac{d}{ds}r(s)_{s=p}+\lim_{s\to p}2H_pr(s)\\ &= r'(p)+2H_pr(p)\\ \end{align}$$ As long as $r(s)$ is $\mathcal O(s^{-2})$ at infinity, the integral $\oint (\psi(-s)+\gamma)^2 r(s) ds$ around a circle with radius approaching infinity should go to zero, meaning that the sum of all residues of $(\psi(-s)+\gamma)^2 r(s)$ should equal zero. Thus, if $q_i$ are the poles of $r(s)$, we have $$\color{green}{\sum_{p=0}^\infty (r'(p)+2H_p r(p))+\sum_{q_i}\text{Res} (\psi(-s)+\gamma)^2 r(s)_{s=q_i}=0}$$ Which is the result given in the paper.

Where was my mistake?","First of all, I know this is a long and intimidating question, but I'm sure anyone with a little bit of complex analysis experience can answer it, so please don't turn away. In this paper by Flajolet and Salvy, they use the series representation of the Digamma function and the fact that, if $p$ is a nonnegative integer, as $s\to p$, $$\psi(-s)+\gamma\sim \frac{1}{s-p}+H_p+...$$ to state that as $s\to p$, $$(\psi(-s)+\gamma)^2\sim \frac{1}{(s-p)^2}+\frac{2H_p}{s-p}+...$$ and so if $r(s)$ is a function with no poles or zeroes at the positive integers, $$\begin{align} \text{Res}\space\space (\psi(-s)+\gamma)^2 r(s)_{s=p} &= \text{Res}\space\space \frac{r(s)}{(s-p)^2}+\frac{2H_p\space r(s)}{s-p}_{s=p}\\ &= \text{Res}\space\space \frac{r(s)}{(s-p)^2}+\frac{2H_p\space r(s)}{s-p}\\ &= \lim_{s\to p} \frac{d}{ds}r(s)_{s=p}+\lim_{s\to p}2H_pr(s)\\ &= r'(p)+2H_pr(p)\\ \end{align}$$ As long as $r(s)$ is $\mathcal O(s^{-2})$ at infinity, the integral $\oint (\psi(-s)+\gamma)^2 r(s) ds$ around a circle with radius approaching infinity should go to zero, meaning that the sum of all residues of $(\psi(-s)+\gamma)^2 r(s)$ should equal zero. Thus, if $q_i$ are the poles of $r(s)$, we have $$\color{green}{\sum_{p=0}^\infty (r'(p)+2H_p r(p))+\sum_{q_i}\text{Res} (\psi(-s)+\gamma)^2 r(s)_{s=q_i}=0}$$ Which is the result given in the paper.

This came about as part of a question that was asking why the principal branch of $z^{1/2}$ doesn't have a Maclaurin series, which I thought was as straightforward as the fact that the derivative doesn't exist at $z = 0$. My textbook claims, however, that $z^{1/2}$ has a singularity at $z = 0$. I don't like leaving tiny things like this unresolved in my mind, so my question I guess is.. Is it indeed the case that $0^{1/2}$ is undefined?",,"['complex-analysis', 'complex-numbers']"
