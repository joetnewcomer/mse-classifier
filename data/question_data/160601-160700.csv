0,The set of differences for a set of positive Lebesgue measure,The set of differences for a set of positive Lebesgue measure,,"Quite a while ago, I heard about a statement in measure theory, that goes as follows: Let $A \subset \mathbb R^n$ be a Lebesgue-measurable set of positive measure. Then we follow that $A-A = \{ x-y \mid x,y\in A\}$ is a neighborhood of zero, i.e. contains an open ball around zero. I now got reminded of that statement as I have the homework problem (Kolmogorov, Introductory Real Analysis, p. 268, Problem 5): Prove that every set of positive measure in the interval $[0,1]$ contains a pair of points whose distance apart is a rational number. The above statement would obviously prove the homework problem and I would like to prove the more general statement. I think that assuming the opposite and taking a sequence $\{x_n\}$ converging to zero such that none of the elements are contained in $A$, we might be able to define an ascending/descending chain $A_n$ such that the union/intersection is $A$ but the limit of its measures zero. I am in lack of ideas for the definition on those $A_n$. I am asking specifically not for an answer but a hint on the problem. Especially if my idea turns out to be fruitful for somebody, a notice would be great. Or if another well-known theorem is needed, I surely would want to know.

3,Explain densities to me please!,Explain densities to me please!,,"When it comes to integration on manifolds, I speak two languages. The first is of course the language of differential forms, which is something I am relatively well acquainted with. The second language is what is often used in general relativity books that follow a rather traditionalist viewpoint (eg. no explicit usage of modern differential geometry, just coordinate and index-based tensor-analysis with ""funky coordinates""), which try to define ""tensor densities"" as indexed objects that pick up some power of the jacobian determinant during coordinate change, in addition to the usual jacobian matrices on the tensor indexes. It is then stated that these ""densities"" can be integrated invariantly. These concepts generally do not come with any rigorous, or even semi-rigorous explanation, just stated and then used without much thought. In time I came to understand ""scalar densities"" as the single independent component of a top-order differential form expressed in some coordinate basis, seeing as this component transforms by picking up the jacobian determinant, which comes directly from the skew-symmetric properties of the differential form, as well as the fact that a top-order form has one independent component only. On the other hand, I have been told by a mathematician whose Lie-groups course I have been attending that densities are perfectly well defined mathematical objects that can be used to integrate on manifolds that aren't orientable. I understand the general idea behind densities, but I have no idea how to rigorously define objects like these, neither do I know how any concrete density even ""looks like"". I mean, if someone asked me the same thing I am asking here, but with differential forms, I would Explain to them algebraic exterior forms on finite dimensional vector spaces, exterior products, etc. Show them that on a tangent space of a differential manifold, any exterior form can be written as a linear combination of wedge products of coordinate differentials, eg. $\mathrm{d}x^\mu$ . Define fields of these objects by either showing what it means for a $p\mapsto\omega_p$ assignment ( $p\in M$ , $\omega_p\in\Lambda^kT^*_pM$ ) to vary smoothly or by ""bundle-izing"" exterior products of cotangent spaces over the manifold. Define the exterior derivative and show how it works. Show that an integral of $k$ -differential form over a $k$ -dimensional submanifold of $M$ is independent of coordinates, basically by defining ( $k=n$ for simplicity) $$ \int_\mathcal{D}\omega=\int_\mathcal{D}F\mathrm{d}x^1\wedge...\wedge\mathrm{d}x^n=\int_{\Psi(\mathcal{D})}F(x^1...x^n)dx^1...dx^n, $$ where $\Psi$ is the coordinate map, and the right side is a standard Riemann-integral or an integral against the standard Lebesgue-measure of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\omega=F\mathrm{d}x^1\wedge...\wedge\mathrm{d}x^n$ , and then showing that if I change the coordinates, everything in the integral transforms in such way that the value of the integral stays the same. Questions: How do I (mostly) rigorously define and construct a density on a manifold and how does it look like? (Eg. like, a differential $n$ -form on an $n$ -dimensional manifold, when expressed in a chart looks like $\omega=F\mathrm{d}x^1\wedge...\wedge\mathrm{d}x^n$ , where $F$ is a scalar function, plus I'd appreciate a similar explanation to what I outlined above for difforms). How are they related to measures? I mean, as an example, I thought about the following: As far as I am aware, every smooth non-orientable manifold is locally orientable, so I guess if I take a differential form defined in some chart, $F\mathrm{d}x^1\wedge...\wedge\mathrm{d}x^n$ (so that the basis $n$ -form is nonvanishing) and then define a measure as $$ \mu_x(\mathcal{D})=\left|\int_\mathcal{D}\mathrm{d}x^1\wedge...\wedge\mathrm{d}x^n\right| ,$$ then this case the integral $$ \int_\mathcal{D}Fd\mu_x $$ makes sense in the chart in a way that is independent of coordinates, because if I change the coordinates, I first transform the differential form, then construct another measure $\mu_y$ , then extend this via a partition of unity, but this isn't really explicit in the sense that I don't think $$F\ d\mu_x $$ is a well defined object without the integral symbol, and I am not even sure what I'm doing here is even correct.","When it comes to integration on manifolds, I speak two languages.

5,Haar Measure of a Topological Ring,Haar Measure of a Topological Ring,,"A topological ring is a (not necessarily unital) ring $(R,+,\cdot)$ equipped with a topology $\mathcal{T}$ such that, with respect to $\mathcal{T}$ , both $(R,+)$ is a topological group and $\cdot:R\times R\to R$ is a continuous map.  A left Haar measure on $R$ is a (nonnegative) measure $\lambda$ on $R$ with respect to the Borel $\sigma$ -algebra of $R$ such that there is a multiplicative map $l:R\to[0,\infty]$ called a left multiplier for which $l(x\cdot y)=l(x)\,l(y)$ for all $x,y\in R$ , $\lambda(x\cdot S)=l(x)\,\lambda(S)$ for all $x\in R$ and for any Borel measurable subset $S\subseteq R$ (with respect to $\mathcal{T}$ ), and $\lambda$ is a Haar measure for the topological group $(R,+)$ . (We interpret $0\cdot \infty$ and $\infty\cdot 0$ as $0$ .) An example is the ring $\text{Mat}_{n\times n}(\mathbb{R})$ of $n$ -by- $n$ matrices over $\mathbb{R}$ under the topology inherited from $\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}\cong\text{Mat}_{n\times n}(\mathbb{R})$ (here, $\cong$ means ""is homeomorphic to"").  If $\textbf{A}=\left[a_{i,j}\right]_{i,j=1,2,\ldots,n}$ , then we take $\text{d}\lambda(\textbf{A})$ to be $\prod_{i=1}^n\,\prod_{j=1}^n\,\text{d}a_{i,j}$ (i.e., $\lambda$ is the Lebesgue measure of $\text{Mat}_{n\times n}(\mathbb{R})\cong \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ ).  Then, $\lambda$ is a left Haar measure of $\text{Mat}_{n\times n}(\mathbb{R})$ with respect to the left multiplier $l(\textbf{X}):=\big|\det(\textbf{X})\big|^n$ for all $\textbf{X}\in\text{Mat}_{n\times n}(\mathbb{R})$ . Another example is $(\mathbb{C},+,\cdot)$ .  We take $\lambda$ to be such that $\text{d}\lambda(z):=\text{d}x\,\text{d}y$ for $z=x+\text{i}y$ .  Then, a left multiplier is $l(w):=|w|^2$ for each $w\in\mathbb{C}$ .  Similarly to the case of the ring of real $n$ -by- $n$ matrices, $\text{Mat}_{n\times n}(\mathbb{C})$ has a left Haar measure $\lambda$ with respect to $l(\textbf{X}):=\big|\det(\textbf{X})\big|^{2n}$ for all $\textbf{X}\in\text{Mat}_{n\times n}(\mathbb{C})$ , i.e., $\text{d}\lambda(\textbf{A}):=\prod_{i=1}^n\,\prod_{j=1}^n\,\left(\text{d}x_{i,j}\,\text{d}y_{i,j}\right)$ for $\textbf{A}=\left[x_{i,j}+\text{i}y_{i,j}\right]_{i,j=1,2,\ldots,n}$ . The third example here is $\mathbb{R}[T]/\left(T^n\,\mathbb{R}[T]\right)$ equipped with the topology inherited from $\mathbb{R}^n$ .  For $f(T)=\left(a_0+a_1T+\ldots+a_{n-1}T^{n-1}\right)+\left(T^n\,\mathbb{R}[T]\right)$ , we take $\text{d}\lambda(f):=\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}\,\text{d}a_i$ .  Then, a left multiplier is $l(g):=\left|b_0\right|^n$ , for $g(T)=\left(b_0+b_1T+\ldots+b_{n-1}T^{n-1}\right)+\left(T^n\,\mathbb{R}[T]\right)$ . Note that we can also similarly define the notion of right Haar measures for rings and their corresponding right multipliers (which are usually denoted by $r$ in this thread). If a ring has both left and right Haar measures, then (due to commutativity of addition) the two Haar measures coincide (up to scalar multiple) and we can omit the adjectives left and right , and simply call them Haar measures (or two-sided Haar measures to be precise). The adjectives ""left"" and ""right"" only indicate which kind of multipliers the ring has.  A ring with a Haar measure is unimodular if the left multiplier coincides with the right multiplier; otherwise, we call the ring non-unimodular . Then, $\text{Mat}_{n\times n}(\mathbb{R})$ , $\mathbb{C}$ (as well as $\text{Mat}_{n\times n}(\mathbb{C})$ ), $\mathbb{R}[T]/\left(T^n\,\mathbb{R}[T]\right)$ (as well as $\mathbb{C}[T]/\left(T^n\,\mathbb{C}[T]\right)$ ), the ring $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ of $p$ -adic integers (see Crostul's comment below), and the ring of formal power series $\mathbb{F}_p[\![ T]\!]$ (see Jyrki Lahtonen's comment below) are examples of unimodular rings.  Of course, many of these rings are commutative rings, and commutative rings with Haar measures are necessarily unimodular. An example of non-unimodular rings is as follows.  Consider $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}$ (some people may denote it by the semidirect sum $\mathbb{R}\,{\supset\!\!\!\!\!\!+}\,\mathbb{R}$ ) with the usual entry-wise addition, but with the twisted multiplication $(u,v)\cdot(x,y):=(ux,uy+v)$ .  Then, with the Haar measure $\text{d}\lambda(a,b):=\text{d}a\,\text{d}b$ , we notice that a left multiplier of $\mathbb{R}^2$ is $l(u,v):=|u|^2$ for every $u,v\in\mathbb{R}$ , whereas a right multiplier is $r(u,v):=|u|$ for every $u,v\in\mathbb{R}$ .  The ring $\text{Mat}_{n\times n}(\mathbb{R})\times\mathbb{R}^n$ (also denoted by $\text{Mat}_{n\times n}(\mathbb{R})\,{\supset\!\!\!\!\!\!+}\,\mathbb{R}^n$ ) and the ring $\text{Mat}_{n\times n}(\mathbb{C})\times\mathbb{C}^n$ (also denoted by $\text{Mat}_{n\times n}(\mathbb{C})\,{\supset\!\!\!\!\!\!+}\,\mathbb{C}^n$ ), with the usual entry-wise addition and with the twisted multiplication $(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{u})\cdot(\mathbf{B},\mathbf{v}):=(\mathbf{AB},\mathbf{Av}+\mathbf{u})$ , are also non-unimodular for the same reason. Has there been any study on this sort of concepts?  I'm sure that I am not the first who thought about the notion of Haar measures for rings.  Are there any criteria for a ring to be unimodular?  Are there rings with Haar measures of a given characteristic $k>0$ which are non-unimodular, or simple, or at least non-commutative?  Are there rings with left Haar measures, but without right Haar measures?  (Unlike groups, I expect to find rings with only one kind of Haar measures.)  The cardinality of each example of rings with Haar measures I have so far is that of the continuum $\mathfrak{c}=2^{\aleph_0}$ .  Do there exist rings with Haar measures of higher cardinalities?  Please let me know if you have or know of any references. On the other hand, there may be some pathology with this concept of Haar measures for rings, and because of that, nobody introduces this concept.  If that is the case, would you please let me know why? EDIT I: I removed a wrong example from the question.  It turns out that, with respect to the discrete topology, $(\mathbb{Z},+,\cdot)$ does not have a Haar measure. EDIT II: I think I may need another compatibility condition, as stated in menag's reply below.  That is, I may need to enforce the following condition (which I shall name it left compatibility ): for any Borel measurable subset $S\subseteq R$ and for every $x\in R$ , $x\cdot S$ is also Borel measurable.  For right Haar measures, we may similarly define right compatibility .  Alternatively, I may need to modify Condition 2 to $\lambda(x\cdot S)=l(x)\,\lambda(S)$ for each Borel measurable subset $S\subseteq R$ and for any $x\in R$ such that $x\cdot S$ is Borel measurable (and likewise for right Haar measures).  I am in favor of the former modification (i.e., the left or right compatibility condition) and shall assume it in all instances. EDIT III: I may be wrong about this claim: ""An abelian group has at most one Haar measure (up to scalar multiple).""  (See the boldfaced portion of my question.)  Without the locally compact Hausdorff assumption, there may be an abelian group with two essentially different Haar measures.  If the underlying additive group of a ring is isomorphic to such an abelian group, then the ring may have a left Haar measure and a right Haar measure which are not proportional.  Maybe somebody who knows better about topological groups can give me some insight.","A topological ring is a (not necessarily unital) ring equipped with a topology such that, with respect to , both is a topological group and is a continuous map.

I am wondering if this admits a converse: Q1. Given a complete measure space , does there always exist an outer measure satisfying the following conditions? A set is -measurable iff , restricted to is . A related question is: Q2. Given a -algebra on , can I always define a complete measure on the measurable space ? To pinpoint the source of my confusion, I feel that the word measure is used in several related, but seemingly different, ways; e.g., ""measure space"", ""measurable space"" and ""outer measure"". If the answers to both the questions are in the affirmative, then it would become clearer to me that these different usages are very related after all.","\varphi X \varphi \sigma \varphi (X, \Sigma, \mu) \varphi E \subseteq X \varphi E \in \Sigma \varphi \Sigma \mu \sigma \Sigma X \mu (X, \Sigma)","['measure-theory', 'examples-counterexamples']"

To give an idea of the sort of equation that I'm looking for, here's now I define grad and div.

Background On this year's USA TSTST (a test that determines a group of about 30 people to take selection tests for the following year's USA team to the International Math Olympiad), there was an algebra/geometry/combinatorics hybrid problem that I found interesting: Show that there is an absolute constant $c < 1$ with the following property: whenever $\mathcal P$ is a polygon with area $1$ in the plane, one can translate it by a distance of $\frac{1}{100}$ in some direction to obtain a polygon $\mathcal Q$, for which the intersection of the interiors of $\mathcal P$ and $\mathcal Q$  has total area at most $c$. Essentially every solution can be boiled down to the following: Step 1. For a given vector $\mathbf{v}\in \mathbb{R}^2$, define $f(\mathbf{v})=\mu\big(\mathcal{P}\cap(\mathcal{P}+\mathbf{v})\big)$, where $\mu(\cdot)$ is the area of a region, and $\mathcal{P}+\mathbf{v}$ consists of the points in $\mathcal{P}$ translated by $\mathbf{v}$. Step 2. Prove $f(\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{v})\geq f(\mathbf{u})+f(\mathbf{v})-1$ and generalize it to $$1-f\left(\sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{v}_i\right)\leq \sum_{i=1}^N \left(1-f\left(\mathbf{v}_i\right)\right).$$ Step 3. Define, for real $t$, $$I_t=\int_{0\leq ||\mathbf{v}||\leq t} f(\mathbf{v})\ d^2\mathbf{v} = \int_{0\leq ||\mathbf{v}||\leq t}\int_{\mathbf{x}\in \mathcal{P}} \mathbf{1}_{\mathcal{P}}(\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{v})\ d^2\mathbf{x}\ d^2\mathbf{v}.$$ We have \begin{align} I_t&=\int_{\mathbf{x}\in \mathcal{P}} \int_{0\leq ||\mathbf{v}||\leq t}\mathbf{1}_{\mathcal{P}}(\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{v})\ d^2\mathbf{v}\ d^2\mathbf{x}\\ &=\int_{\mathbf{x}\in \mathcal{P}} \mu\left(\mathcal{P}\cap\big\{\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{v}\big|0\leq ||\mathbf{v}||\leq t\big\}\right)\ d^2\mathbf{x}\\ &\leq\int_{\mathbf{x}\in \mathcal{P}} 1\ d^2\mathbf{x} = 1. \end{align} So, there must exist some $\mathbf{v}$ with $0\leq ||\mathbf{v}||\leq t$ that satisfies $$f(\mathbf{v})\leq \frac{1}{\pi t^2}.$$ Step 4. Write this vector as $$\mathbf{v}=\sum_{i=1}^{\lceil 100t\rceil}\mathbf{u}_i$$ where $||\mathbf{u}_i||=1/100$. Step 5. We now have $$1-\frac{1}{\pi t^2}\leq 1-f(\mathbf{v})\leq \sum_{i=1}^N (1-f(\mathbf{u}_i)),$$ so for some $i$ we must have $$1-f(\mathbf{u}_i) \geq \frac{1}{\lceil 100t\rceil}\left(1-\frac{1}{\pi t^2}\right)$$ $$f(\mathbf{u}_i) \leq 1-\frac{1}{\lceil 100t\rceil}\left(1-\frac{1}{\pi t^2}\right).$$ As long as $t^2>1/\pi$, this gives us a working value of $c<1$. It is minimized at $t=0.98$, which gives $$c\approx 0.99318.$$ More generally, if $\lambda$ is the length of our translate, this is minimized at the nearest integer multiple of $\lambda$ to $\sqrt{3/\pi}$, which gives $$c\approx 1-2\lambda\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{27}}.$$ In particular, for large enough $\lambda$, this bound does nothing. Progress I've been able to improve the bound on $c$ given slightly in the following manner: Assume, for all $||\mathbf{u}||=\lambda$, that $f(\mathbf{u})>1-\epsilon$. Then, for all vectors $\mathbf{v}$ of length $\leq n\lambda$, by writing $\mathbf{v}=\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{u}_i$ with $||\mathbf{u}_i||=\lambda$, we must have $$1-f(\mathbf{v})\leq n\epsilon\implies f(\mathbf{v})\geq 1-n\epsilon.$$ Using (almost) our same integral as earlier and setting $t=N\lambda$, we have $$\int_{\lambda< ||\mathbf{v}||\leq t} f(\mathbf{v})\ d^2\mathbf{v}\leq 1.$$ (we cannot start the integral at $0$ as vectors with magnitude $<\lambda$ cannot be represented as the sum of one vector with magnitude $\lambda$). However, \begin{align} \int_{\lambda \leq ||\mathbf{v}||\leq N\lambda} f(\mathbf{v})\ d^2\mathbf{v} &= \sum_{k=2}^N \int_{(k-1)\lambda< ||\mathbf{v}|| \leq k\lambda} f(\mathbf{v})\ d^2\mathbf{v}\\ &\geq  \sum_{k=2}^N \int_{(k-1)\lambda< ||\mathbf{v}|| \leq k\lambda} 1-k\epsilon\ d^2\mathbf{v}\\ &= \pi\lambda^2\sum_{k=2}^N (2k-1)(1-k\epsilon)\\ &= \pi\lambda^2\frac{N-1}{6}\left(6N+6-\epsilon\left(4N^2 + 7N  + 6\right)\right), \end{align} so $$\pi\lambda^2\frac{N-1}{6}\left(6N+6-\epsilon\left(4N^2 + 7N  + 6\right)\right)\leq 1$$ $$N+1-\epsilon\left(\frac{4N^2 + 7N  + 6}{6}\right)\leq \frac{1}{\pi(N-1)\lambda^2}$$ $$N+1- \frac{1}{\pi(N-1)\lambda^2}\leq \epsilon\left(\frac{4N^2 + 7N  + 6}{6}\right)$$ $$\frac{6\left(\pi\left(N^2-1\right)\lambda^2- 1\right)}{\left(4N^2 + 7N  + 6\right)\left(\pi(N-1)\lambda^2\right)}\leq \epsilon$$ $$1-\frac{6\left(\pi\left(N^2-1\right)\lambda^2- 1\right)}{\left(4N^2 + 7N  + 6\right)\left(\pi(N-1)\lambda^2\right)}\geq 1-\epsilon.$$ Minimizing $N$ gives you about $0.9898$ for $\lambda=1/100$. On the other hand, I've also been trying to find constructions that give a large value of $c$. I haven't come up with any great ones - the best I have is a circle of radius $\sqrt{\frac{1}{\pi}}$ which gives you a $c$ of about 0.9887 . For larger $\lambda$ the best I can think of is something like a ""star"" with large radius and very many thin ""prongs,"" but I haven't calculated the asymptotics on it yet. I believe the bound given in step 2 of the solution is sharp iff $$(\mathcal{P}+\mathbf{u})\cap(\mathcal{P}+\mathbf{v})\subseteq\mathcal{P}\subseteq(\mathcal{P}+\mathbf{u})\cup(\mathcal{P}+\mathbf{v}),$$ but all attempts I've made to find measurable sets for which this is true or nearly true for small vectors have failed.

However, \begin{align} \int_{\lambda \leq ||\mathbf{v}||\leq N\lambda} f(\mathbf{v})\ d^2\mathbf{v} &= \sum_{k=2}^N \int_{(k-1)\lambda< ||\mathbf{v}|| \leq k\lambda} f(\mathbf{v})\ d^2\mathbf{v}\\ &\geq  \sum_{k=2}^N \int_{(k-1)\lambda< ||\mathbf{v}|| \leq k\lambda} 1-k\epsilon\ d^2\mathbf{v}\\ &= \pi\lambda^2\sum_{k=2}^N (2k-1)(1-k\epsilon)\\ &= \pi\lambda^2\frac{N-1}{6}\left(6N+6-\epsilon\left(4N^2 + 7N  + 6\right)\right), \end{align} so $$\pi\lambda^2\frac{N-1}{6}\left(6N+6-\epsilon\left(4N^2 + 7N  + 6\right)\right)\leq 1$$ $$N+1-\epsilon\left(\frac{4N^2 + 7N  + 6}{6}\right)\leq \frac{1}{\pi(N-1)\lambda^2}$$ $$N+1- \frac{1}{\pi(N-1)\lambda^2}\leq \epsilon\left(\frac{4N^2 + 7N  + 6}{6}\right)$$ $$\frac{6\left(\pi\left(N^2-1\right)\lambda^2- 1\right)}{\left(4N^2 + 7N  + 6\right)\left(\pi(N-1)\lambda^2\right)}\leq \epsilon$$ $$1-\frac{6\left(\pi\left(N^2-1\right)\lambda^2- 1\right)}{\left(4N^2 + 7N  + 6\right)\left(\pi(N-1)\lambda^2\right)}\geq 1-\epsilon.$$ Minimizing $N$ gives you about $0.9898$ for $\lambda=1/100$. On the other hand, I've also been trying to find constructions that give a large value of $c$. I haven't come up with any great ones - the best I have is a circle of radius $\sqrt{\frac{1}{\pi}}$ which gives you a $c$ of about 0.9887 . For larger $\lambda$ the best I can think of is something like a ""star"" with large radius and very many thin ""prongs,"" but I haven't calculated the asymptotics on it yet. I believe the bound given in step 2 of the solution is sharp iff $$(\mathcal{P}+\mathbf{u})\cap(\mathcal{P}+\mathbf{v})\subseteq\mathcal{P}\subseteq(\mathcal{P}+\mathbf{u})\cup(\mathcal{P}+\mathbf{v}),$$ but all attempts I've made to find measurable sets for which this is true or nearly true for small vectors have failed. So I'm stuck. Anyone have any ideas, either on sharper upper bounds on $c$ or a sharper $\mathcal{P}$?",,"['measure-theory', 'lebesgue-measure', 'geometric-measure-theory']"

Here's what I've already tried. (1) From $\mu\ll\nu\ll\eta$ it follows $\mu\ll\eta$ and from this by Radon-Nikodým, that it exists a density $\frac{d\mu}{d\eta}$ of $\mu$ relating to $\eta$, that is $\eta-\text{ a.s.}$ unique. Moreover, there is a second density of $\mu$ relating to $\eta$, getting by using $\mu\ll\nu$ and $\nu\ll\eta$ and again Radon-Nikodým: It exists a density $\frac{d\mu}{d\nu}$, that is $\nu-\text{ a.s.}$ unique and for which it is $\mu=\frac{d\mu}{d\nu}\nu$. Similarly, there exists a density $\frac{d\nu}{d\eta}$, that is $\eta-\text{ f.s.}$ unique and for which it is $\nu=\frac{d\nu}{d\eta}\eta$.

Moreover, there is a second density of $\mu$ relating to $\eta$, getting by using $\mu\ll\nu$ and $\nu\ll\eta$ and again Radon-Nikodým: It exists a density $\frac{d\mu}{d\nu}$, that is $\nu-\text{ a.s.}$ unique and for which it is $\mu=\frac{d\mu}{d\nu}\nu$. Similarly, there exists a density $\frac{d\nu}{d\eta}$, that is $\eta-\text{ f.s.}$ unique and for which it is $\nu=\frac{d\nu}{d\eta}\eta$.

A product measure is defined to be a measure on the measurable space satisfying the property: for all . a. I can see that the product of -algebras is a categorical product; but is it correct to say that it is also a tensor product in some analogue to the tensor product in vector spaces? In which case how? And is there a universal property that expresses it as such? b. I don't see how to express the product of measures as a categorical product. Is it? Though tensor products are usually defined for vector spaces, its most generally defined for abelian groups : For and two abelian groups, their tensor product is a new abelian group which is such that a group homomorphism is equivalently a bilinear map out of and . Then some evidence that we might be able to interpret the product of measures as a kind of 'tensor product' is that supposing and are disjoint in , we have: = That is it satisfies the bilinearity property for the tensor product for disjoint sets.","(X_{1},\Sigma _{1}) (X_{2},\Sigma _{2}) \Sigma _{1} \Sigma _{2} X_{1} X_{2} \mu _{1} \mu _{2} \Sigma _{1}\otimes \Sigma _{2} X_{1}\times X_{2} B_{1}\times B_{2} B_{1}\in \Sigma _{1} B_{2}\in \Sigma _{2} \mu _{1}\times \mu _{2} (X_{1}\times X_{2},\Sigma _{1}\otimes \Sigma _{2}) (\mu _{1}\times \mu _{2})(B_{1}\times B_{2})=\mu _{1}(B_{1})\mu_{2}(B_{2}) B_{1}\in \Sigma _{1},\ B_{2}\in \Sigma _{2} \sigma A B A\otimes B A\otimes B \rightarrow C A B B_1 B_1' \Sigma_1 (\mu _{1}\times \mu _{2})((B_{1} \sqcup B_1')\times B_{2})=\mu _{1}(B_{1} \sqcup B_1')\mu_{2}(B_{2})=(\mu _{1}B_{1}+ \mu _{1}B_{1}') \times \mu_{2}B_{2} (\mu_1 \times \mu_2)(B_1,B_2)+(\mu_1 \times \mu_2)(B_1',B_2)","['measure-theory', 'category-theory']"
