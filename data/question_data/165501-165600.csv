In particular, the right hand side seems to be ""summing up"" the length segment of all of the level sets of $f$ , whereas the left hand side is the area under the function $f$ . Why are they equivalent intuitively? Is this somehow related to how the abstract integration is defined on measure spaces: Partitioning the range instead of partitioning the domain? I can not seem to relate these concepts tightly together into a good enough intuition. * Update: After some pondering and rethinking about the comment of @BrianTung, here are my thoughts on my question: To understand the equality $$ \int_X f(x) \,d\mu(x) = \int_0 ^\infty \mu(\{ x \in X: f(x) > t \}) \,dt $$ intuitively, we might as well just situate us in the case where $\mu$ is the Lebesgue measure. Then indeed the left hand side is exactly the area under the graph of $f$ essentially by immediate definition. The expression on the right hand side of the equality like @Brain Tung commented $$ \int_0 ^\infty \mu(\{ x \in X: f(x) > t \}) \,dt $$ can be intuitively and almost naively understood as treating $\mu(\{ x \in X: f(x) > t \})$ as the length of a rectangle and $dt$ as the width of the rectangle and the integral sign as a sum over these partitioning rectangles. (This naive interpretation actually doesn't correspond to any known integration theory that I know of... It seems to be just purely reading off notations while using a Riemann integral type interpretation). The picture below can be used to describe this procedure: As both sides of the equality are the area under the graph, the equality indeed should hold. * Questions Remaining: Note that the right hand side is another Lebesgue integral: $\int_0 ^\infty \mu(\{ x \in X: f(x) > t \}) \,dt$ . In particular, this right hand side is ""intuitively"" the area under the function $g(t) := \mu(\{ x \in X: f(x) > t \})$ on the domain $t \in [0, +\infty)$ .

Simple function integrals are defined by summing up the product of the function value and it's corresponding range pre-image. This quite literally computes the area under the graph of the simple functions. The Monotone Convergence Theorem tells us we can approximate Lebesgue integral of a nonnegative Lebesgue measurable functions using these kind of upward approximating simple functions.

A more accurate picture of thinking about Lebesgue integrals can be found below: In fact, this is why intuitively Lebesgue integrals are set up to represent the area under the graph of the nonnegative Lebesgue measurable function $f$ . Now as it doesn't matter how we partition and sum up the total area, instead of evaluating the area using the second picture above, we can actually evaluate the area using the first picture. * Update 2 : After some discussions, I have gained some intuitive understanding of the integral on the right hand side. While not geometrically meaningful, but we can still interpret the integral as the following: We are essentially using the function $g(t) = \mu(\{ x \in X: f(x) \geq t \})$ to build up the integral of $\int_X f(x) \,d\mu(x)$ . That is to say, we wish to integrate the function $g$ from $0$ to $+\infty$ to get the area of the function $f$ . Now note $g(t)$ (height of $g$ at $t$ ) is intuitively the measure/amount of points $x$ such that $f(x) \geq t$ . Now the simple function integral approximate $\int_0 ^\infty g(t) \,dt$ would sum up the product of the g(t) with the measure of the preimage of $g(t)$ . That is, we will sum up the product of the amount of points $x$ such that $f(x) \geq t$ with a certain weight given by the preimage of $g(t)$ (again a measure of how many points are in a given interval in the range of $g(t)$ ). In particular, we get a weighted sum of the amount of points $x$ such that $f(x) \geq t$ to approximate $\int_0 ^\infty g(t) \,dt$ . This makes intuitive sense: Points $x$ such that $f(x)$ is bigger will get double counted many times while points $x$ such that $f(x)$ is small might only be counted once or twice. Indeed, every time we count the points $x$ with $f(x)$ small, we also count the points $x$ with $f(x)$ large. This means points $x$ with higher function value of $f(x)$ will contribute (weight-adjusted contribution) to the integral of $\int_X f(x) \,d\mu(x)$ (Left hand side of the equality) more than the points $x$ with lower function value of $f(x)$ ! This, in fact, explains the name ""Layer Cake Representation"": For every $t \in [0, +\infty)$ (more precisely, for every piece of partition in $[0, +\infty)$ under the interval partition of the range of $g$ ), we butter the base ( $x$ -axis) with one layer of cream (measure/amount of points $x$ such that $f(x)$ is above $t$ ) according to the height of the function $f$ .

Proof: First, we need a simple lemma. Lemma: Let $\mathcal A = (A_i)_{i\in I}$ be a countable partition of $X$ such that $\emptyset \in \mathcal A$ . Then $$ \sigma (\mathcal A) = \mathcal B:= \left \{ \cup_{i \in J} A_i  \,\middle\vert\, J \subset I  \right\}. $$ Proof: It's clear that any $\sigma$ -algebra that contains $\mathcal A$ will contain $\mathcal B$ .

I know this is a lot longer than what it is necessary to be, but I want everything in the proof to be crystal clear to me. I also bolded the part that I am unsure about: Let $(X, \mathcal{F}, \mu)$ be the measure space. Suppose $f_n \xrightarrow{a.u.} f$ . That is, for all $\epsilon > 0$ , there exists $E_\epsilon \in \mathcal{F}$ such that $\mu(E_\epsilon) < \epsilon$ and $$ \lim_{n \to \infty} \sup_{x \in X - E_\epsilon}|f_n(x) - f(x)| = 0. $$ We wish to show for all $c > 0$ that $$ \lim_{n \to \infty} \mu(\{ x \in X: |f_n(x) - f(x)| \geq c \}) = 0. $$ To this end, for all $c > 0$ and $n \in \mathbf{N}$ , we define $A_c^n = \{ x \in X: |f_n(x) - f(x)| \geq c \}$ . Then for all $c > 0$ and $\epsilon > 0$ , we must have $A_c^n \cap (X - E_\epsilon) = \emptyset$ for $n$ large enough. To see this, let $\epsilon > 0$ . Then we must have some $E_\epsilon \in \mathcal{F}$ such that $\mu(E_\epsilon) < \epsilon$ and $$ \lim_{n \to \infty} \sup_{x \in X - E_\epsilon} |f_n(x) - f(x)| = 0. $$ Therefore, for all $a > 0$ , there exists $N(a, \epsilon) \in \mathbf{N}$ such that if $n \geq N(a, \epsilon)$ , then $$ \sup_{x \in X - E_\epsilon} |f_n(x) - f(x)| < a. $$ Thus we must have if $n \geq N(a, \epsilon)$ , then for all $x \in X - E_\epsilon$ that $$ |f_n(x) - f(x)| \leq \sup_{x \in X - E_\epsilon} |f_n(x) - f(x)| < a. $$ In particular, for all $c > 0$ , there exists $N(c, \epsilon) \in \mathbf{N}$ such that if $n \geq N(c, \epsilon)$ , then for all $x \in X - E_\epsilon$ that $$ |f_n(x) - f(x)| < c. $$ Thus for all $\epsilon > 0$ and $c > 0$ , there exists $N(c, \epsilon) \in \mathbf{N}$ such that if $n \geq N(c, \epsilon)$ , then $x \not \in A_c^n$ . In particular, this implies for all $\epsilon > 0$ and $c > 0$ , there exists $N(c, \epsilon) \in \mathbf{N}$ such that if $n \geq N(c, \epsilon)$ , then $A_c^n \subseteq E_\epsilon$ . Therefore, we have for all $\epsilon > 0$ and $c > 0$ , there exists $N(\epsilon, c) \in \mathbf{N}$ such that if $n \geq N(\epsilon, c)$ , then $$ \mu(A_c^n) \leq \mu(E_\epsilon) < \epsilon. $$ Thus, we have for all $c > 0$ and $\epsilon > 0$ that $$ \lim_{n \to \infty} \mu(A_c^n) \leq \epsilon. $$ Thus we have for all $c > 0$ that $$ 0 \leq \lim_{n \to \infty} \mu(A_c^n) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \mu(\{ x \in X: |f_n(x) - f(x)| \geq c \}) \leq 0. $$ In particular, we must have for all $c > 0$ that $$ \lim_{n \to \infty} \mu(\{ x \in X: |f_n(x) - f(x)| \geq c \}) = 0. $$ This proves that $f_n \xrightarrow{\mu} f$ by definition.

47,Actions on Bernoulli space have almost the same orbits,Actions on Bernoulli space have almost the same orbits,,"Let $(\mathbb{B}, \nu)$ be the binary space with probability measure $\nu(0) = \nu(1) = \frac{1}{2}$ . The map $T : \mathbb{B}^{\mathbb{N}} \to \mathbb{B}^{\mathbb{N}}$ is defined as left addition with carry, i.e. if $x = (1, \ldots, 1, 0, x_k, \ldots)$ then $T(x) = (0, \ldots, 0, 1, x_k, \ldots)$ . This map is a measure preserving Borel isomorphism. We can define two actions on the product space $(\mathbb{B}^{\mathbb{N}}, \nu^{\otimes \mathbb{N}})$ as follows: $\mathbb{B}^{\mathbb{N}} \curvearrowright \mathbb{B}^{\mathbb{N}}$ through componentwise addition modulo 2. $\mathbb{Z} \curvearrowright \mathbb{B}^{\mathbb{N}}$ through $k \cdot x := T^k(x)$ . Show that these actions are orbit equivalent, in other words, there exists a Borel isomorphism $\varphi : \mathbb{B}^{\mathbb{N}} \to \mathbb{B}^{\mathbb{N}}$ which is measure preserving and satisfies $\varphi(\mathbb{B}^{\mathbb{N}} \cdot x) = \mathbb{Z} \cdot \varphi(x)$ for almost every $x \in \mathbb{B}^{\mathbb{N}}$ . I'm pretty stumped on this problem. If I'm not mistaken the orbit $\mathbb{B}^{\mathbb{N}} \cdot x$ should be the entire space $\mathbb{B}^{\mathbb{N}}$ itself. Since $\varphi$ is supposed to be an isomorphism I assume this means $\mathbb{Z} \cdot \varphi(x) = \mathbb{B}^{\mathbb{N}}$ as well. However the former seems to be a countable set, while the latter isn't? Is there something obvious I'm seeing wrong here? This problem is taken from the paper A. Ioana's lecture notes ""Orbit Equivalence of Ergodic Group Actions"" , Exercise 1.21. Edit: So I thought of a potential solution, but I'm not sure I can take it all the way to its end, so here goes. For any $x \in \mathbb{B}^\mathbb{N}$ , it seems clear on one hand that $\mathbb{B}^\mathbb{N} \cdot x = \mathbb{B}^\mathbb{N}$ . On the other hand, the set $\mathbb{Z} \cdot x$ contains all sequences that eventually have the same tail end as $x$ , in other words it contains all the following sets: $$ \begin{align} \{x_0\} \times \{x_1\} \times \{x_2\} &\times \cdots \\ \mathbb{B} \times \{x_1\} \times \{x_2\} &\times \cdots \\ \mathbb{B} \times \mathbb{B} \times \{x_2\} &\times \cdots \\ &\vdots \end{align} $$ Hence if we define the Borel sets $Z_k = \mathbb{B}^k \times \{x_k\} \times \{x_{k+1}\} \times \cdots$ for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$ it follows from $Z_k \subseteq \mathbb{Z} \cdot x$ that $\bigcup^\infty_{k=0} Z_k \subseteq \mathbb{Z} \cdot x$ . At this point I'd use the measure of the union as a lower bound for the measure of $\mathbb{Z} \cdot x$ but I now realize that's not as obvious as it first looked.","Let be the binary space with probability measure .

Assume there is a sequence $(B_n)$ of measurable sets such that $\mu(B_n) \to 1$ .

Then  is differentiable -a.e.,f f \in L_1 (\mu) \mu f \mu,"I'm reading Section 2.1 of Chapter 2 in Villani's textbook Topics in Optimal Transportation. Now, let us assume that $\mu$ does not give mass to small sets, and let $\varphi$ be as above. Since $\varphi$ lies in $L^{1}(d \mu)$ , it is $d \mu$ -almost everywhere finite: $\mu[\operatorname{Dom}(\varphi)]=1$ . On the other hand, the border $\partial \operatorname{Dom}(\varphi)$ of the convex set $\operatorname{Dom}(\varphi)$ is a small set; so, $\mu[\operatorname{Int}(\operatorname{Dom}(\varphi))]=1$ . Now, on $\operatorname{Int}(\operatorname{Dom}(\varphi))$ , the set of nondifferentiability of $\varphi$ is a small set. On the whole, $d \mu$ -almost every point of $X$ is a differentiability point for $\varphi$ . So, for $d \mu$ -almost all $x$ , the subdifferential of $\varphi$ at the point $x$ is $\{\nabla \varphi(x)\}$ . Recalling that a statement true for $d \mu$ -almost all $x$ is also true for $d \pi$ -almost all $(x, y)$ , we obtain that $y=\nabla \varphi(x)$ for $d \pi$ -almost all $(x, y)$ .

A subset $B$ of $X$ is a small set if its Hausdorff dimension $\dim_H (B)$ is at most $d-1$ . Assume that $\mu$ does not give mass to small sets, i.e., $\mu (B) =0$ for every Borel set $B$ which is also a small set. Let $f:X \to \mathbb R \cup \{+\infty\}$ be proper convex such that $f \in L_1 (\mu)$ . Theorem: The map $f$ is differentiable $\mu$ -a.e. If $N$ be a $\mu$ -null subset of $X$ such that $f$ is differentiable on $N^c := X \setminus N$ , then the gradient $\nabla f :N^c \to X$ of $f$ is measurable. I'm not sure if my below attempt is fine, or it contains some logical mistakes. Could you please have a check on it? My attempt: Let $D_1 := \operatorname{dom} f := \{x \in X \mid f(x) < +\infty\}$ and $D_2 := \operatorname{int} D_1$ . Because $f$ is proper convex, $D_1 \neq \emptyset$ is convex. Because $f \in L_1 (\mu)$ , $D_1$ is Borel measurable and $\mu(D_1) = 1$ . Because $D_1$ is convex, its boundary $\partial D_1$ is a small set , i.e., $\dim_H (\partial D_1) \le d-1$ . Then $\mu(\partial D_1)=0$ . Let $$ E := \{x \in D_2 \mid  f \text{ is not differentiable at }x\}. $$ Then $E$ is Borel measurable and is a small set , i.e., $\dim_H (E) \le d-1$ . So $\mu (E) = 0$ . Let $F := D_2 \setminus E$ . Then $$ F = \{x \in D_2 \mid  f \text{ is differentiable at }x\} $$ is Borel measurable and $\mu (F) =1$ . Clearly, $f$ is differentiable on $F$ and thus differentiable $\mu$ -a.e. Let $N$ be a $\mu$ -null subset of $X$ such that $f$ is differentiable on $N^c := X \setminus N$ . Then the gradient $\nabla f : N^c \to X$ of $f$ is well-defined. Let $$ \frac{\partial f}{ \partial x_i} : N^c \to \mathbb R \quad i = 1, \ldots,d $$ be the partial derivatives of $f$ on $N^c$ . We have $\nabla f$ is Borel measurable if and only if $\frac{\partial f}{ \partial x_i}$ is measurable for all $i = 1, \ldots,d$ . Let $\{e_1, \ldots, e_d\}$ be an orthonormal basis of $X$ . Notice that $$ \frac{\partial f}{ \partial x_i} (x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{f(x+e_i/n)-f(x)}{1/n} = \lim_{n \to \infty} n \left [ f \left (x + \frac{e_i}{n} \right) - f (x) \right ]. $$ Because $f$ is continuous, the map $$ g_{n,i}: N^c \to \mathbb R, x \mapsto n \left [ f \left (x + \frac{e_i}{n} \right) - f (x) \right ] $$ is measurable for each $n \in \mathbb N^*$ and each $i \in \{1, \ldots, d\}$ . It follows that $$ \frac{\partial f}{ \partial x_i} = \lim_n g_{n, i} $$ is measurable.

On the whole, -almost every point of is a differentiability point for . So, for -almost all , the subdifferential of at the point is . Recalling that a statement true for -almost all is also true for -almost all , we obtain that for -almost all .

59,Is the Haar measure of the boundary of an open subset of the $k$-torus zero?,Is the Haar measure of the boundary of an open subset of the -torus zero?,k,"I have just recently started reading the basics of topological groups and Haar measures, and have become really curious about when the boundary of a non-empty open subset $U$ of a compact abelian group $G$ , has zero Haar measure. Here and in the following, by ""Haar measure"", I will mean the normalized Haar measure of a compact abelian group. After some searching, I found these posts ( When does the boundary have measure zero? and Conditions that ensure that the boundary of an open set has measure zero ) which give very general sufficient conditions for subsets of $\mathbb R^n$ to have boundaries of Lebesgue measure zero, however I couldn't find any analogues for Haar measures. I would like to restrict $G$ to the $n$ -torus $\mathbb T^n$ , so here's my Semi-general question: Consider the $n$ -torus $\mathbb T^n = \mathbb R^n/\mathbb Z^n$ which is a topological group, and a closed subgroup $H$ (which can be assumed to be connected if necessary). Consider the Haar measure $\mu_H$ on $H$ and an open set $U \subset \mathbb T^n$ . What minimal additional conditions on $U$ might we need (if any) for the $H$ -Haar measure of the boundary $\partial(U \cap H)$ of the open subset $U \cap H \subset H$ to be zero, that is to have $\mu_H(\partial (U \cap H)) = 0$ ? If $H$ were $\mathbb T^n$ itself, then we know that $\mu_H$ is simply the $n$ -dimensional Lebesgue measure and the question reduces to one already answered in the linked posts. If $H$ were an open subgroup, then (if I understand correctly) the Haar measure of $\mathbb T^n$ would also restrict to the normalized Haar measure of $H$ , so that $\mu_H$ would just be the restriction of the $n$ -dimensional Lebesgue measure, and once again the question is answered. But of course, $\mathbb T^n$ being connected has no non-empty proper open subgroups, so the last statement doesn't really add anything in my context. So what about the general setting, namely when $H$ is a proper non-empty closed subgroup (again, assumed connected if necessary)? If nothing can be said in the above setting (even with some minimal additional conditions), the specific $H$ and $U$ I would like to know about are the following: consider any real numbers $a_1, \cdots, a_n$ and any complex numbers $c_1, \cdots, c_n$ . My $H$ is the closure of the subgroup $\{(e^{2 \pi i a_1 t}, \cdots, e^{2 \pi i a_n t}): t \in \mathbb R\} \subset \mathbb T^n$ , and $U \subset \mathbb T^n$ is the set of all $(z_1, \cdots, z_n) \in \mathbb T^n$ , for which the complex number $c_1z_1 + \cdots + c_n z_n$ has strictly positive real part. Can we say in this case that $\partial(U \cap H)$ has $H$ -Haar measure zero? Note 1 : I do not know if this will be relevant, but in the above example, $U$ can be written as the intersection of $\mathbb T^n$ with the set $V := \{(z_1, \cdots, z_n) \in \mathbb C^n: \Re \sum_{j=1}^n c_j z_j > 0\} \subset \mathbb C^n$ , so that $U \cap H = V \cap H$ . Here, $V$ is both open and convex in $\mathbb C^n$ , hence its boundary has zero Lebesgue measure. Note 2: It might seem that the role of $U$ in my semi-general question is kind of superficial since we are really working with the open subset $U \cap H$ of $H$ , but it is in line with my last example.","I have just recently started reading the basics of topological groups and Haar measures, and have become really curious about when the boundary of a non-empty open subset of a compact abelian group , has zero Haar measure.

68,Some Applications of the Spectral Theorem for Normal Operators,Some Applications of the Spectral Theorem for Normal Operators,,"I have used the spectral theorem for normal operators, to prove some basic results related to the spectra of operators. Please provide feedback for my proofs, and feel free to suggest any other ways (using the spectral theorem). The Spectral Theorem . If $T$ is a normal operator on a separable space, then there exists a finite measure space $(X,\mu)$ and $h\in L^\infty(X,\mu)$ such that $T$ is unitarily equivalent to the operator $M_h$ on $L^2(X,\mu)$ . Throughout, assume that $T$ is a normal operator. By the Spectral Theorem as stated above, there exists a unitary $U$ such that $U^*TU = M_h$ . We have $\sigma(T) = \sigma(UM_hU^*) = \sigma(M_h) = \operatorname{essran} h$ (the essential range of $h$ ). I have also shown that if $\operatorname{essran} h \subset A \subset\mathbb C$ , then $h(x) \in A$ a.e. on $X$ , and I will use this in the proofs below. $1$ . $T$ is Hermitian if and only if $\sigma(T) \subset \mathbb R$ . Suppose $T$ is Hermitian, i.e. $T=T^*$ . So, $M_h = M_h^* = M_{\overline{h}}$ . This implies $h = \overline{h}$ everywhere, so $h$ is real. As $\operatorname{essran} h \subset \overline{\operatorname{im} h} \subset \mathbb R$ , we have $\sigma(T) \subset \mathbb R$ . Conversely, suppose $\sigma(T) \subset \mathbb R$ , i.e. $\operatorname{essran} h \subset \mathbb R$ . So, $h$ is real a.e., i.e. $h = \overline{h}$ a.e. Let $f\in L^2(X,\mu)$ . As $h = \overline{h}$ a.e., we have $hf = \overline{h}f$ a.e.; but elements of $L^2(X,\mu)$ are really equivalence classes of functions agreeing with each other a.e, so $M_h f = M_{\overline{h}} f$ . That is, $M_h = M_{\overline{h}} = M_h^*$ . As $T = UM_hU^*$ , we have $T=T^*$ . $2$ . $T$ is unitary if and only if $\sigma(T) \subset S^1$ , where $S^1 := \{z\in \mathbb C: |z| = 1\}$ . Suppose $T$ is unitary, i.e. $TT^* = T^*T = I$ . We get $TT^* = UM_hU^*UM_{\overline{h}}U^* = UM_hM_{\overline{h}} U^* = UM_{h\overline{h}}U^* = I$ . So, $M_{h\overline{h}} = I$ . Take arbitrary $f\in L^2(X,\mu)$ and see that $f = h\overline{h} f$ which means $|h|^2 = 1$ giving $|h| = 1$ . That is, $\operatorname{im} h \subset S^1$ . Since closure preserves inclusions, and $S^1$ is a closed subset of $\mathbb C$ , I argue that $\operatorname{im} f\subset S^1$ . As $\operatorname{essran} h \subset \overline{\operatorname{im} h}$ , we have $\operatorname{essran} h \subset S^1$ . Therefore, $\sigma(T)\subset S^1$ . Conversely, suppose $\sigma(T) \subset S^1$ , i.e. $\operatorname{essran} h \subset S^1$ . So, $|h| = 1$ a.e. on $X$ , i.e. $h\overline{h} = 1$ a.e. Using an argument similar to that in the previous proof, we conclude $M_{h\overline{h}} = M_h M_{\overline{h}} = I$ . It follows that $TT^* = T^*T = I$ , i.e. $T$ is unitary. $3$ . $T$ is positive if and only if its spectrum is on the non-negative real axis, i.e. $\sigma(T) \subset \mathbb R_{\ge 0}$ . Firstly, let us see that $T$ is positive if and only if $M_h$ is positive. We have $\langle Tx,x\rangle = \langle UM_hU^*x,x\rangle = \langle M_hU^*x, U^*x\rangle$ , and the claim follows from the observation that $U^* = U^{-1}$ is invertible. Now, suppose $T\ge 0$ , i.e. $M_h \ge 0$ . So, for every $f\in L^2(X,\mu)$ , $\langle M_hf,f\rangle \ge 0$ . Expanding the inner product, we have $\langle M_hf, f\rangle = \int_X hf\overline{f}\, d\mu = \int_X h|f|^2 \, d\mu \ge 0$ . Putting $f = \chi_{\{h < 0\}}$ , we get $\int_X h\chi_{\{h < 0\}}\, d\mu = \int_{\{h < 0\}} h\, d\mu \ge 0$ ; but $\int_X h\chi_{\{h < 0\}}\, d\mu = \int_{\{h < 0\}} h\, d\mu \le 0$ , giving $\int_{\{h < 0\}} h\, d\mu = 0$ . This forces $\mu(\{h < 0\}) = 0$ , i.e. $h\ge 0$ a.e. Define $h_1:= h\chi_{h\ge 0}$ . Clearly, $h = h_1$ a.e., so $\operatorname{ess ran} h = \operatorname{ess ran} h_1$ . As $\operatorname{ran} h_1 \subset [0,\infty)$ (giving $\overline{\operatorname{ran} h_1} \subset [0,\infty)$ ), we have $\operatorname{ess ran} h_1 \subset [0,\infty)$ . It follows that $\operatorname{ess ran} h \subset \mathbb R_{\ge 0}$ , as required. For the converse, assume $\sigma(T)\subset \mathbb R_{\ge 0}$ . Then, $\operatorname{essran} h \subset \mathbb R_{\ge 0}$ . This implies $h(x) \ge 0$ a.e. on $X$ . Therefore, for any $f\in L^2(X,\mu)$ , $\int_X h|f|^2\, d\mu = \int_X hf\overline{f} d\mu \ge 0$ , i.e. $\langle M_h f,f\rangle \ge 0$ . So, $M_h \ge 0$ which yields $T\ge 0$ . $4$ . $T$ is a projection if and only if $\sigma(T)\subset \{0,1\}$ . If $P\in \mathcal B(\mathcal H)$ is an idempotent operator, i.e. $P^2 = P$ , then the following are equivalent: (i) $P$ is an orthogonal projection onto a closed subspace (ii) $P$ is Hermitian (iii) $P$ is normal. Suppose $T$ is a projection; then $T^2 = T$ . So, $M_{h^2} = M_h$ which gives $h = h^2$ a.e., i.e. $h(x) \in \{0,1\}$ a.e. Define $h_1:= h\chi_{S}$ , where $S = h^{-1}(\{0,1\})$ . Clearly, $h_1 = h$ a.e. and $h_1(x) \ge 0$ for all $x\in X$ . Consequently, $\operatorname{ess ran} h = \operatorname{ess ran} h_1 \subset \overline{\operatorname{ran} h_1} \subset \{0,1\}$ . Thus, $\sigma(T) \subset \{0,1\}$ . Conversely, suppose $\sigma(T)\subset\{0,1\}$ , i.e. $\operatorname{ess ran} h \subset \{0,1\}$ . Then, $h(x) \in \{0,1\}$ a.e., i.e. $h^2 = h$ a.e. which means $M_h = M_{h^2}$ , and $T=T^2$ . Since $\sigma(T) \subset \mathbb R$ , $T$ is also Hermitian. In view of the aforementioned equivalence, $T$ is a projection. Thank you very much for reading!

78,Is this a sufficiently rigorous proof of the multivariable integral substitution rule?,Is this a sufficiently rigorous proof of the multivariable integral substitution rule?,,"$\newcommand{\d}{\mathrm{d}}$ I came up with this myself, but my proof will appear fairly brief, so I suspect it is not fully rigorous - although I do not see any mistakes, hence the question. First I would like to show that: $$\tag{1}\int_{\Omega}(g\circ f)(x)\,\d\mu(x)=\int_{f(\Omega)}g(x)\,\d(\mu\circ f^{-1})(x)$$ Where $\Omega,f(\Omega),(g\circ f)(\Omega)$ are measurable spaces, with $\mu$ the measure on $\Omega$ and $g,f$ measurable functions w.r.t the relevant sigma algebras. I think this is called ""push-forward"", but I have not seen a proof of it. My attempt: Assuming $g$ and $f$ measurable, both integrals in the LHS and RHS make sense, where $f^{-1}$ is understood as preimage rather than a functional inverse, as $\mu\circ f^{-1}$ is a measure as $f^{-1}(A)$ is measurable in $\Omega$ if $A$ is measurable in $f(\Omega)$ , and $f^{-1}(A\cup B)=f^{-1}(A)\cup f^{-1}(B)$ so the additivity requirements on a measure are satisfied, etc. Use the definition of Lebesgue integral by simple functions: if $\phi\in S^+({g^+})$ defined on $(\mu\circ f^{-1})$ -measurable sets $A_k$ then: $$\begin{align}\int_{f(\Omega)}g^+\,\d(\mu\circ f^{-1})&\ge\int_{f(\Omega)}\phi\,\d(\mu\circ f^{-1})\\&=\sum_{k}c_k\cdot(\mu\circ f^{-1})(A_k)\\&=\sum_kc_k\cdot\mu(E_k)\\&\le\int_{\Omega}(g\circ f)^+\,\d\mu\end{align}$$ Where $E_k=f^{-1}(A_k)$ . We find that a simple function in $f(\Omega)$ is a lower bound to $g^+$ iff and only if it is a lower bound to $(g\circ f)^+$ in $\Omega$ , and it has the same integral in both spaces. Since the two spaces $S^+(g^+,\mu\circ f^{-1})=S^+((g\circ f)^+,\mu)$ are equal in integration, the limit-from-below definition of Lebesgue integral finds that: $$\int_{f(\Omega)}g^+\,\d(\mu\circ f^{-1})=\int_{\Omega}(g\circ f)^+\,\d\mu$$ From which it follows that the integrals in $(1)$ are indeed the same. Note - that was very, very brief. The equality of the two integrals felt obvious to me, but perhaps a true proof is more difficult than this. I'll now move on to substitution: Let $\Omega,f(\Omega),(g\circ f)(\Omega)$ all be measurable spaces, and suppose that $f(\Omega)$ forms a $\sigma$ -finite measure space with the measure $\mu$ , where $g,f$ are measurable functions. Now suppose that $f$ is bijective, with functional inverse $\psi$ , and that $\psi:f(\Omega)\to\Omega$ is measurable. It follows from the measurability of $f$ that $\Omega$ is $\sigma$ -finite w.r.t the measure $\mu\circ f$ , but suppose also that $\Omega$ forms a sigma-finite measure space with the measure $\nu$ . Then: $$\int_{f(\Omega)}g(x)\,\d\mu=\int_{f(\Omega)}(g\circ f)(\psi(x))\,\d\mu=\int_{\Omega}(g\circ f)(x)\,\d(\mu\circ \psi^{-1})=\int_{\Omega}(g\circ f)(x)\,\d(\mu\circ f)$$ Where $(1)$ was used. By the $\sigma$ -finiteness, we can take the Radon-Nikodym derivative of $(\mu\circ f)$ w.r.t $\nu$ , and find: $$\tag{2}\int_{f(\Omega)}g(x)\,\d\mu=\int_{\Omega}(g\circ f)(x)\cdot\frac{\d(\mu\circ f)}{\d\nu}\,\d\nu$$ Let $\Omega\subset\Bbb R^n,f(\Omega)\subset\Bbb R^n$ , $\mu=\mu_n$ the Lebesgue measure on $\Bbb R^n$ , and $\nu=\mu_n$ also. Suppose $g$ is a measurable function, and suppose $f$ is $C^1$ in $\Bbb R^n$ and $\det J_f\neq 0$ everywhere in $\Omega$ . Then the inverse function theorem gives that $\psi$ exists as a $C^1$ map everywhere in $f(\Omega)$ , and is therefore measurable. As the reals are sigma finite w.r.t these measures, we can employ $(2)$ , so must find the measurable function $\varphi$ such that: $$\mu_m(f(A))=\int_A\varphi(x)\,\d\mu_n(x)$$ For all Lebesgue measurable $A$ in $\Bbb R^n$ . Assume $A$ to not be a null set, which is fine since if it were a null set both LHS and RHS would be zero regardless of $\varphi$ ; indeed, take $A$ w.l.o.g (as $\varphi$ is guaranteed to be unique up to a.e. equivalence) to be a ball $B(r)$ centred about any point $x$ in $\Omega$ . Then the Lebesgue differentiation theorem gives that, a.e.: $$\lim_{r\to0^+}\frac{(\mu_n\circ f)(B_r(x))}{\mu_n(B_r(x))}=\varphi(x)$$ Let $\epsilon\gt0$ be fixed. As $f$ is $C^1$ , we can write $f(x+h)-f(x)=J_f(x)\cdot h+o(\epsilon)$ when $\|h\|$ is small, say $0\lt\|h\|\lt\delta$ . Suppose $r\lt\delta$ ; then, by translational invariance of Lebesgue's measure and subadditivity: $$\begin{align}\mu_n(f(B_r(x)))&=\mu_n\{f(x+h):h\in\Bbb R^n,\,\|h\|\lt r\}\\&=\mu_n\{f(x+h)-f(x):h\in\Bbb R^n,\,\|h\|\lt r\}\\&\le\mu_n\{J_f(x)\cdot h:h\in\Bbb R^n,\,\|h\|\lt r\}+\mu_n(B_{r+|o(\epsilon)|}(x)\setminus B_r(x))\end{align}$$ Lebesgue's measure has the nice property that it scales by $|\det T|$ for any $T$ a linear map, so this becomes: $$\begin{align}0&\le(\mu_n\circ f)(B_r(x))\\&\le|\det J_f(x)|\mu_n(B_r(x))+\mu_n(B_{r+|o(\epsilon)|}(x)\setminus B_r(x))\\&=|\det J_f(x)|\mu_n(B_r(x))+o(\epsilon^n)\end{align}$$ In division by $\mu_n(B_r(x))$ , the limit becomes: $$\varphi(x)=\lim_{r\to0^+}|\det J_f(x)|+\frac{o(\epsilon^n)}{\mu_n(B_r(x))}=|\det J_f(x)|$$ Therefore $|\det J_f(x)|$ is the desired R-N derivative, and using $2$ we finally have: $$\int_{f(\Omega)}g(x)\,\d\mu_n(x)=\int_{\Omega}(g\circ f)(x)|\det J_f(x)|\,\d\mu_n(x)$$ Is this a complete proof? I'm worried it's too simple...","I came up with this myself, but my proof will appear fairly brief, so I suspect it is not fully rigorous - although I do not see any mistakes, hence the question. First I would like to show that: Where are measurable spaces, with the measure on and measurable functions w.r.t the relevant sigma algebras. I think this is called ""push-forward"", but I have not seen a proof of it. My attempt: Assuming and measurable, both integrals in the LHS and RHS make sense, where is understood as preimage rather than a functional inverse, as is a measure as is measurable in if is measurable in , and so the additivity requirements on a measure are satisfied, etc. Use the definition of Lebesgue integral by simple functions: if defined on -measurable sets then: Where . We find that a simple function in is a lower bound to iff and only if it is a lower bound to in , and it has the same integral in both spaces. Since the two spaces are equal in integration, the limit-from-below definition of Lebesgue integral finds that: From which it follows that the integrals in are indeed the same. Note - that was very, very brief. The equality of the two integrals felt obvious to me, but perhaps a true proof is more difficult than this. I'll now move on to substitution: Let all be measurable spaces, and suppose that forms a -finite measure space with the measure , where are measurable functions. Now suppose that is bijective, with functional inverse , and that is measurable. It follows from the measurability of that is -finite w.r.t the measure , but suppose also that forms a sigma-finite measure space with the measure . Then: Where was used. By the -finiteness, we can take the Radon-Nikodym derivative of w.r.t , and find: Let , the Lebesgue measure on , and also. Suppose is a measurable function, and suppose is in and everywhere in . Then the inverse function theorem gives that exists as a map everywhere in , and is therefore measurable. As the reals are sigma finite w.r.t these measures, we can employ , so must find the measurable function such that: For all Lebesgue measurable in . Assume to not be a null set, which is fine since if it were a null set both LHS and RHS would be zero regardless of ; indeed, take w.l.o.g (as is guaranteed to be unique up to a.e. equivalence) to be a ball centred about any point in . Then the Lebesgue differentiation theorem gives that, a.e.: Let be fixed. As is , we can write when is small, say . Suppose ; then, by translational invariance of Lebesgue's measure and subadditivity: Lebesgue's measure has the nice property that it scales by for any a linear map, so this becomes: In division by , the limit becomes: Therefore is the desired R-N derivative, and using we finally have: Is this a complete proof?

Proposition . Let $\phi:X \to Y$ , and let $(X,\Sigma)$ be a measurable space. We can obtain a related measurable space $(Y,T)$ by defining $T=\{F\subset Y:\phi^{-1}F\in \Sigma\}.$ Also fix a function $g:\text{dom}(g)\to\mathbb{R}$ with $\text{dom}(g)\subset Y.$ Show that $g$ is $T$ -measurable iff $g\phi=g \circ \phi$ is $\Sigma$ -measurable.

Explicitly we are interested in solutions to the equation $$ m(x) = \int_0^1 d y \delta(x - g(y))m(y) \tag{$*$} $$ we write $g(x)$ in the following form $$ g(x) = \begin{cases} 1 - n + \frac{1}{x} & \qquad \text{for} \qquad \frac{1}{n} \leq x < \frac{1}{n-1}, \quad n = 3 , 4 ,5 , 6 \ldots \\ n - \frac{1}{1-x}  & \qquad \text{for} \qquad \frac{n-1}{n} \leq x < \frac{n-2}{n-1}, \quad n = 3 , 4 ,5 , 6 \ldots \end{cases} $$ Substituting this in to ( $*$ ) we obtain $$ m(x) = \sum_{n=3}^\infty \left[ \frac{m\left(\frac{1}{n-1+x}\right)}{(n-1+x)^2} + \frac{m\left(1-\frac{1}{n-x}\right)}{(n-x)^2} \right] $$ We integrate this to obtain $$ c(x) = \sum_{n=3}^\infty \left[ c\left( \frac{1}{n-1} \right) - c\left( \frac{1}{n-1+x} \right) + c\left( 1- \frac{1}{n} \right) - c\left( 1- \frac{1}{n-x} \right) \right] $$ where $c(x) = \int_0^x m(y) dy$ is the cumulative distribution function. The expected symmetry of the distribution $m(x) = m(1-x)$ allows for some simplification, specifically we use $c(x) = 1 - c(1-x)$ to obtain $$ c(x) = \sum_{n=3}^\infty \left[ c\left( \frac{1}{n-1} \right) - c\left( \frac{1}{n-1+x} \right) - c\left( \frac{1}{n} \right) + c\left( \frac{1}{n-x} \right) \right] $$ The constant terms telescope and we obtain $$ \begin{equation} c(x) = 1 - c(1-x) = \frac{1}{2} + \sum_{n=3}^\infty \left[ c\left( \frac{1}{n-x} \right) - c\left( \frac{1}{n-1+x} \right) \right] \tag{$**$} \end{equation} $$ where we have used that $c(1/2)=1/2$ .

It is easily seen that $|\phi(f)|\le 2\phi(|f|)$ for all $f\in X$ . Suppose that $\phi$ is unbounded. Then there exists a sequence $(f_n)\subset X$ with $\|f_n\|=1$ and $|\phi(f_n)|\ge 2\cdot 4^n$ . Put $g_n := |f_n|\ge 0$ . Then $\|g_n\|=1$ and $\phi(g_n)\ge 4^n$ for $n\in\mathbb N$ . Define the function $h := \sum_{n=1}^\infty2^{-n}g_n\in X$ . Then $h\ge 2^{-n}g_n$ for each $n\in\mathbb N$ and so $\phi(h)\ge 2^{-n}\phi(g_n)\ge 2^n$ for all $n\in\mathbb N$ , which is impossible. Question: Why do we have $h\ge 2^{-n}g_n$ for each $n\in \mathbb N$ ? This doesn't seem to follow from the assumptions made. Do we need $X$ to be an $L^p$ space with $1\leq p< \infty$ ? It looks like we are using the property that if $f_n\geq 0$ for each $n$ and $f_n\to f$ with respect to $\|\cdot \|$ then $f\geq 0$ . But why is this true? Am I missing something?

This will ensure that $|x|:=\sup\{x,-x\}\in X$ whenever $x\in X$ , that $\||x|\| = \|x\|$ , and that the positive cone $P := \{ x \in X : x\geq 0\}$ is closed (see here ). In the case where $X=L^p$ for some $1\leq p< \infty$ I believe we can argue as follows: Choose a representative for $h$ and $\sum_{i=1}^n2^{-i}g_i$ for each $n$ . Then $\sum_{i=1}^n2^{-i}g_i \to h$ in $L^p$ as $n\to \infty$ . We can extract a subsequence $(n_k)$ with $\sum_{i=1}^{n_k}2^{-i}g_i \to h$ a.s. as $k\to \infty$ .

This implies that for every $n\geq 1$ there exists $H_n\supset A$ open such that $|H_n\setminus A|<\frac{1}{n}$ so if we define for every $k\geq 1$ the set $G_k:=\bigcap_{n=1}^{k} H_k$ we have that the $G_k$ s form a decreasing sequence ( $G_{k+1}=\bigcap_{n=1}^{k+1}H_k=\bigcap_{n=1}^{k}H_k \cap H_{k+1}\subset \bigcap_{n=1}^{k}H_k=G_k$ ) of open sets (since each $G_k$ is the intersection of finitely many open sets) containing $A$ ( $A\subset H_n$ for every $n\geq 1$ implies $A\subset \bigcap_{n=1}^{k}H_n=G_k$ ). Now, since for every $m\geq 1$ we have that $(\bigcap_{k=1}^{\infty}G_k)\setminus A\subset G_m\setminus A\subset H_m\setminus A$ and hence $|(\bigcap_{k=1}^{\infty}G_k)\setminus A|\leq |G_m\setminus A|\leq |H_m\setminus A|<\frac{1}{m}$ it follows that $|(\bigcap_{k=1}^{\infty}G_k)\setminus A|=0$ , as desired. $\square$","I have proved the following statement and I would like to know if it is correct and/or/if it could be improved somehow, thanks: ""If is Lebesgue measurable there exists a decreasing sequence of open sets containing such that "" My proof: Let be a Lebesgue measurable set: then we know that for every there exists an open set such that .
