I have a solution, but my solution is unsatisfactory since it requires some rather complicated computation, which seems impossible to  finish during an exam. My solution. Note that the recurrence relation can be rewritten as $$\frac1{a_{n+1}}=\frac1{a_n}+\frac1{3-a_n},\qquad n=1,2,3,\cdots.$$ Therefore, $$\frac1{a_{100}}=1+\sum_{n=1}^{99}\frac1{3-a_n}.$$ It follows from the original recurrence relation that $a_n$ is decresing and thus $a_n\leq 1$ . Using $\frac1{3-a_n}\geq \frac13$ , we have $$\frac1{a_{100}}\geq 1+\frac{99}3=\frac{102}3,$$ which implies that $100a_{100}\leq \frac{300}{102}<3$ . Hence (C) and (D) are excluded. My gut told me that (B) should be the right answer, since $a_n$ will decreasing to $0$ (an exercise for those who are just learning the concept of limits,) in which case $\frac1{3-a_n}$ is almost $\frac13$ . Let's check the correctness of (B).

33,Are my calculations of a new constant similar to Mill's constant based on $\lfloor A^{2^{n}}\rfloor$ and Bertrand's postulate correct?,Are my calculations of a new constant similar to Mill's constant based on  and Bertrand's postulate correct?,\lfloor A^{2^{n}}\rfloor,"As Wikipedia explains in number theory, Mills' constant is defined as: ""The smallest positive real number $A$ such that the floor function of the double exponential function $\lfloor A^{3^{n}}\rfloor$ is a prime number, for all natural numbers $n$. This constant is named after William H. Mills who proved in 1947 the existence of $A$ based on results of Guido Hoheisel and Albert Ingham on the prime gaps. Its value is unknown, but if the Riemann hypothesis is true, it is approximately $1.3063778838630806904686144926...$ (sequence A051021 in OEIS)."" In other words, $\lfloor A^{3^{n}}\rfloor$ is said to be a prime-representing function , because $f(x)$ is a prime number for all positive integral values of $x$. The demonstration made by Mills in 1947 ( pdf here ) is very easy to follow (one must be careful about the already known typos of the paper to follow properly the explanation). It is also known that generically (as explained in this nice question at MSE) $\lfloor Q^{k^{n}}\rfloor$ always works if $k$ is at least $3$, so there are other constants $Q$ not defined yet that will work when $k$ is greater than $3$. It is also known that $k=2$ might not work because it depends on the Legendre's conjecture : is there always a prime between $N^2$ and $(N+1)^2$ (thought to be extremely difficult to demonstrate). The reason of this question is that based on the original demonstration and using the Bertrand's postulate as key for some manipulations, I tried to do my own version of the Mill's constant to learn, and it seems that was able to find a constant $L$ that for $\lfloor L^{2^{n}}\rfloor$  provides a sequence of integers associated to their next prime, so it is possible to calculate the associated sequence primes by a prime-representing function. The difference of this approach is that the sequence of integers obtained from $\lfloor L^{2^{n}} \rfloor$ are not primes directly, it is an integer sequence, but there is an associated sequence of primes obtained from them. Here is how it works (the questions are at the end of the explanation): According to Bertrand's postulate for a given integer (let also suppose for the demonstration that it is prime) $p_i$ it holds: $p_i < p_j < 2p_i$ for some existing prime $p_j$ Now adding $+p_i^2+1$ in the inequalities: $p_i+p_i^2+1 < p_j+p_i^2+1 < 2p_i+p_i^2+1$ Which is also true if in the left side we just leave $p_i^2$: $p_i^2 < p_j+p_i^2+1 < (p_i+1)^2$ Calling $e_j = p_j+p_i^2+1$ it is possible to build (from here I will use the same steps as in Mill's paper ) a sequence of integers $E_1, E_2,...E_n$ such as: $E_1=P_1=2$ $E_1^2 < E_2 < (E_1+1)^2$ $E_2^2 < E_3 < (E_2+1)^2$ ... $E_{n-1}^2 < E_n < (E_{n-1}+1)^2$ ... The same conditions for the sequence shown in Mill's demonstration would hold for this expression, and in this case the exponent is $2$ instead of $3$ but we do not depend on Legendre's conjecture because the associated prime $P_n$ to $E_n$ is a Bertrand's prime (so it exists always in the interval $[E_n,2E_n]$). In other words, it is possible to use the power of $2$ because the sequence is not directly a sequence of primes, but a sequence of integers attached to primes by Bertrand's postulate according to the manipulation: $P_n = E_n-E_{n-1}^2-1$ And in the same fashion as Mill's constant: $E_n=\lfloor L^{2^{n}} \rfloor$ Where L is obtained after some manual calculations (up to $n=11$) as $L_{11}=1.7197977844041078190854...$ The way of manually calculating the constant is as follows, in the same fashion that Mill's demonstration, the relationship between $L_n$ (the constant calculated after knowing the $n^{th}$ element of the sequence $E_n$) and $E_n$ is: $L_n=E_n^{\frac{1}{2^n}}$ These are the calculations for the first $5$ elements: For instance for $n=1..5$, $\lfloor L^{2^{n}} \rfloor$ is: $E_1=2$ $E_2=8$ and $P_1=E_2-(E_1)^2-1=8-2^2-1=3$ $E_3=76$ and $P_2=E_3-(E_2)^2-1=76-8^2-1=76-64-1=11$ $E_4=5856$ and $P_3=E_4-(E_3)^2-1=5856-76^2-1=5856-5776-1=79$ $E_5=34298594$ and $P_4=E_5-(E_4)^2-1=34298594-5856^2-1=5857$ $L$ slightly grows on every iteration but the growth is each time smaller, so it clearly tends to a fixed value when $n \to \infty$. This is the graph: So in essence the prime-representing function would be: $P_n = \lfloor L^{2^{n}} \rfloor -E_{n-1}^2-1 = \lfloor L^{2^{n}} \rfloor -(\lfloor L^{2^{n-1}} \rfloor)^2-1$ for $n \ge 2$, $P_n \in \Bbb P$. ...being the starting element of the sequence $E_1=2=P_1$ and $L$ the value of $L_n$ when $n \to \infty$.

38,"Can we show that $1+2+3+\dotsb=-\frac{1}{12}$ using only stability or linearity, not both, and without regularizing or specifying a summation method?","Can we show that  using only stability or linearity, not both, and without regularizing or specifying a summation method?",1+2+3+\dotsb=-\frac{1}{12},"Regarding the proof by Tony Padilla and Ed Copeland that $1+2+3+\dotsb=-\frac{1}{12}$ popularized by a recent Numberphile video , most seem to agree that the proof is incorrect, or at least, is not sufficiently rigorous. Can the proof be repaired to become rigorously justifiable? If the proof is wrong, why does the result it computes agree with other more rigorous methods? Critiques of the proof seem to fall into two classes. One class of responses is to appeal to higher math for justification. For example, appeal to zeta function regularization , as is done by Edward Frenkel in a followup video for Numberphile and a more recent video by Mathologer , or to use an exponential regulator, as shown by Luboš Motl here on M.SE , or a smooth cutoff regulator as in Terry Tao's wonderful blog post on the subject . These are great, but don't really address what's wrong with the naive computation. Another response is that the sum is infinite, the series is divergent, and the manipulations are wrong, because manipulations of divergent series can lead to inconsistent results. See for example the answer by robjohn at this question , where he uses similar manipulations to show that the sum must also be $-\frac{7}{12}$. A similar contradiction is shown at the beginning of Tao's post. And Wikipedia's article on the series has a subheading showing that any stable and linear summation method which sums the series implies 0=1. See also Hagen von Eitzen's answer here for some excellent discussion. A reference to the Riemann series theorem may also be appropriate here. These responses are perhaps too dismissive, since there are a variety of rigorous ways to assign finite numbers to divergent sums. People say you have to be careful with divergent series, but few seem to be willing to say what steps the careful observer may take. Proofs of the type given in that first Numberphile video can be valid if one is careful. For comparison, without specifying a summation method, but just manipulating series in a similar fashion, you can show that the geometric series $1+x+x^2+\dotsb$ sums to $\frac{1}{1-x}$, which is valid for any value of $x$ for which there exists any stable linear summation method. So for example once we know that $1+2+4+8+_\dotsb$ converges 2-adically , without any further information we know that its sum must be $-1$, even though classical summation cannot sum the divergent series. With that in mind, let's reexamine the computation in the Numberphile video (which I've pasted below in its entirety, copied from Kenny LJ from this question with some edits for understability and rigor). He uses the Grandi series $1-1+1-1+\dotsb = \frac{1}{2}$ and the series $1-2+3-4+\dotsb=\frac{1}{4}$ to derive his result. These series are Cesàro summable , and Cesàro summation is stable and linear, and which allows the manipulations to be justified. I think this first half of the computation is completely justifiable. All we lack is a proof that the two series are Cesàro summable, which is not hard. However the third series $1+2+3+\dotsb$ is not Cesàro summable, nor indeed can any stable linear method sum it, as already mentioned. Zeta function regularization can sum it. Given a series $\sum a_n$, we may perform analytic continuation of $\sum \dfrac{1}{a_n^s}$ to $s=-1$. This is stable, but not linear. Alternatively the Dirichlet series can sum it. That is analytic continuation of $\sum \dfrac{a_n}{n^s}$ to $s=0$, which is linear but not stable.  Either method can sum $1+2+3+\dotsb$ and in fact the two methods coincide for this series. So I think is the error in the Numberphile video, where they write $(0 + 4 + 0 + 8 + 0 + 12 + \dotsb) =  4+8+12+\dotsb$. If you want to use a linear summation method, you should not also assume stability. Can the calculation be saved? Can we show by a naive computation using only linearity but not stability, or vice versa only stability but not linearity, that $1+2+3+\dotsb=-\frac{1}{12}$, without an explicit choice of a summation method? This question is mostly a duplicate of What mistakes, if any, were made in Numberphile's proof that $1+2+3+\cdots=-1/12$? , or perhaps What consistent rules can we use to compute sums like 1 + 2 + 3 + ...? or What can be computed by axiomatic summation? which I am reposting with more context, because I feel that the answers there did not completely engage or address the question. Numberphile's Proof of $1+2+3+\dotsb=-\frac{1}{12}$. $S_1 = 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + \dotsb$ $S_1 = 1 + (-1 + 1 - 1\dotsb)$ using stability $-1 + 1 - 1\dotsb = -S_1$ using linearity hence $S_1=1-S_1$ and $S_1=\frac{1}{2}$. $S_2 = 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + \dotsb $ $S_2' = 0 + 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + \dotsb = 0 + S_2 = S_2$ by stability $S_2 + S_2' = 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 \dotsb = 2S_2$ by linearity hence $2S_2  = S_1 = \frac{1}{2}$ and $S_2=\frac{1}{4}.$. $S_3 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \cdots $ Finally, take \begin{align} S_3 - S_2 & = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \cdots           \\ & - (1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + \cdots)          \\ & =   0 + 4 + 0 + 8 + \cdots           \\ & = 4 + 8 + 12 + \cdots           \\ & = 4S_3 \end{align} here we used linearity to get to line 3, stability to get to line 4, and linearity to get to line 5. Hence $-S_2=3S_3$ or $-\frac{1}{4}=3S_3$. And so $S_3=-\frac{1}{12}$. $\blacksquare$ Wikipedia's proof that stable linear summation methods cannot sum $1+2+3+\dotsb$ $S_3=1 + 2 + 3 + \dotsb$ $S_3' = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + \dotsb = 0 + S_3 = S_3$ by stability. $S_4 = S_3 - S_3' = 1 + 1 + 1 + \dotsb = S_3 - S_3 = 0$ $S_4' = 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + \dotsb = 0 = S_4$ by stability again, and $S_4 - S_4' = 1 + 0 + 0 + \dotsb = 1$ by linearity, which is a contradiction.","Regarding the proof by Tony Padilla and Ed Copeland that $1+2+3+\dotsb=-\frac{1}{12}$ popularized by a recent Numberphile video , most seem to agree that the proof is incorrect, or at least, is not sufficiently rigorous. Can the proof be repaired to become rigorously justifiable? If the proof is wrong, why does the result it computes agree with other more rigorous methods? Critiques of the proof seem to fall into two classes. One class of responses is to appeal to higher math for justification. For example, appeal to zeta function regularization , as is done by Edward Frenkel in a followup video for Numberphile and a more recent video by Mathologer , or to use an exponential regulator, as shown by Luboš Motl here on M.SE , or a smooth cutoff regulator as in Terry Tao's wonderful blog post on the subject . These are great, but don't really address what's wrong with the naive computation. Another response is that the sum is infinite, the series is divergent, and the manipulations are wrong, because manipulations of divergent series can lead to inconsistent results. See for example the answer by robjohn at this question , where he uses similar manipulations to show that the sum must also be $-\frac{7}{12}$. A similar contradiction is shown at the beginning of Tao's post. And Wikipedia's article on the series has a subheading showing that any stable and linear summation method which sums the series implies 0=1. See also Hagen von Eitzen's answer here for some excellent discussion. A reference to the Riemann series theorem may also be appropriate here. These responses are perhaps too dismissive, since there are a variety of rigorous ways to assign finite numbers to divergent sums. People say you have to be careful with divergent series, but few seem to be willing to say what steps the careful observer may take. Proofs of the type given in that first Numberphile video can be valid if one is careful. For comparison, without specifying a summation method, but just manipulating series in a similar fashion, you can show that the geometric series $1+x+x^2+\dotsb$ sums to $\frac{1}{1-x}$, which is valid for any value of $x$ for which there exists any stable linear summation method. So for example once we know that $1+2+4+8+_\dotsb$ converges 2-adically , without any further information we know that its sum must be $-1$, even though classical summation cannot sum the divergent series. With that in mind, let's reexamine the computation in the Numberphile video (which I've pasted below in its entirety, copied from Kenny LJ from this question with some edits for understability and rigor). He uses the Grandi series $1-1+1-1+\dotsb = \frac{1}{2}$ and the series $1-2+3-4+\dotsb=\frac{1}{4}$ to derive his result. These series are Cesàro summable , and Cesàro summation is stable and linear, and which allows the manipulations to be justified. I think this first half of the computation is completely justifiable. All we lack is a proof that the two series are Cesàro summable, which is not hard. However the third series $1+2+3+\dotsb$ is not Cesàro summable, nor indeed can any stable linear method sum it, as already mentioned. Zeta function regularization can sum it. Given a series $\sum a_n$, we may perform analytic continuation of $\sum \dfrac{1}{a_n^s}$ to $s=-1$. This is stable, but not linear. Alternatively the Dirichlet series can sum it. That is analytic continuation of $\sum \dfrac{a_n}{n^s}$ to $s=0$, which is linear but not stable.  Either method can sum $1+2+3+\dotsb$ and in fact the two methods coincide for this series. So I think is the error in the Numberphile video, where they write $(0 + 4 + 0 + 8 + 0 + 12 + \dotsb) =  4+8+12+\dotsb$. If you want to use a linear summation method, you should not also assume stability. Can the calculation be saved? Can we show by a naive computation using only linearity but not stability, or vice versa only stability but not linearity, that $1+2+3+\dotsb=-\frac{1}{12}$, without an explicit choice of a summation method? This question is mostly a duplicate of What mistakes, if any, were made in Numberphile's proof that $1+2+3+\cdots=-1/12$? , or perhaps What consistent rules can we use to compute sums like 1 + 2 + 3 + ...? or What can be computed by axiomatic summation? which I am reposting with more context, because I feel that the answers there did not completely engage or address the question.

Let us call $d(n)$ the classical divisor function, i.e. $d(n)=\sum_{d|n}$ is the number of divisors of the integer $n$. It is well known that the sum of $d(n)$ over all positive integers from $n=1$ to $x$, when $x$ tends to infinity, is asymptotic to $$x \ln(x) + (2 \gamma-1) x + O(\sqrt{x})$$ I would like to calculate a similar asymptotic expression for the sum of $d(n)/n$, again calculated from $n=1$ to $x$ and for $x$ that tends to infinity. I have made some calculations and obtained the  formula  $$1/2 (\ln(x))^2 + 2 \gamma \ln (x) + O(1)$$  where gamma is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. I am interested in the constant term of the expression, which seems to be around $0.48$. I suspect that it could correspond to $\gamma^2 - 2\gamma_1$,   where $\gamma_1$ is the first Stieltjes constant ($-0.072...$). Could someone confirm this to me?

The product formula can be transformed into a series expansion as well but in order to keep it neat, some definitions first: For the real sequence $\left(a_i\right)_{i\in\mathbb N}$ with $\sum a_i$ convergent, define $$ A_n:=\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} a_i^n $$ $$ \alpha_n:=\sum_{(x_1,\dots,x_n)\in M_n}\prod_{r=1}^{n} a_{x_r} $$ Where $M_n:=\{(x_1,\dots,x_n)\in\mathbb N\space|\space x_1<\dots<x_n\}$.

By comparison of the coefficients, we obtain $\gamma_k=\frac{(-1)^k}{(2k+1)!}$. Now, through telescoping, it can be shown algebraically that for every sequence $\left(a_i\right)_{i\in\mathbb N}$ with $\sum a_i$ convergent we have: $$\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(-1)^{n-i}\alpha_{n+1-i}\space A_{i}}=A_{n+1}+(-1)^{n+1}(n+1)\alpha_{n+1}$$ For all $n\in\mathbb N_0$.
