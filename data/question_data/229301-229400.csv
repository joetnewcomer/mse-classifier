0,Equivalence between two definitions of closure of $A\subseteq B$ under a function $f\colon B\to B$,Equivalence between two definitions of closure of  under a function,A\subseteq B f\colon B\to B,"Synopsis In one of the exercises in Enderton's Elements of Set Theory , we are introduced to the concept of the closure of a set to another set under a function $f$ with two constructions. Let $f$ be a function from $B$ into $B$ and assume that $A \subseteq B$ . We have two possible methods for constructing the ""closure"" $C$ of $A$ under $f$ . First, we have the construction: $$C^* = \bigcap\{X \mid A \subseteq X \subseteq B \wedge f [\![X]\!] \subseteq X \}.$$ Alternatively, we could apply the recursion theorem to obtain the function $h$ for which $$h(0) = A$$ $$h(n^+) = h(n) \cup f[\![h(n)]\!].$$ Define $C_*$ to be $\bigcup \text{ran } h$ ; in other words: $$C_* = \bigcup_{i \in \omega} h(i).$$ In the exercise, we were asked to prove that $C^* = C_*$ , which I was able to do without too much effort. The next exercise, though, which asks us to find the closure $C$ if we take $B$ to be the set of real numbers, $f(x) = x^2$ , and $A$ the closed interval $[\frac{1}{2}, 1]$ , confused me a great deal. This is because the sets $C^*$ and $C_*$ described above make little sense to me intuitively. I have a general idea that the closure of $A$ under $f$ describe how the function $f$ always maps to values within $A$ , but I'm not sure how this closure is a set, or how the constructions above elucidate this concept. For example, when people say that the natural numbers are closed under multiplication, how is the closure under multiplication a set? Isn't that just a property? Anyways, all I've been able to make out from the above exercise with my incomplete understanding is that $1/2$ must be in $C$ and as such, $1/4$ , $1/8$ , $1/16$ ... all the way to $0$ . But I'm not sure if this means that the closure $C$ is the set $[0,1]$ . It seems like it might be right, but I can't understand how it fits into the definitions above! In conclusion, can someone please explain to me why the sets $C^*$ and $C_*$ are defined the way they are, and how I can understand the intuition behind them better? I feel like this is all just an issue with me not understanding the formal definitions. I'm self studying this course before I start my first year at university, so you guys are the closest thing I have to a professor!

One of these is called the underlying set, and the others are operations of various arity . Since operations are functions, which are sets of ordered pairs, this is why we can interpret the components of an algebraic structure to be sets. For example, a group is a quadruple $(G,0,-,+)$ where $G$ is the underlying set, $0 \subseteq G^0 \times G$ is a nullary operation , $- \subseteq G \times G$ is a unary operation, and $+ \subseteq G^2 \times G$ is a binary operation. My question is why we choose an ordered tuple to describe the algebraic structure. For instance, does it make a difference if I define a group to be $(G,+,-,0)$, where I list the operations in order of descending, rather than ascending, arity? If the order doesn't matter, why don't we just define a group to be $\{G,0,-,+\}$, rather than an ordered tuple?

From Stephen Abbott's Understanding Analysis . Proof 01 Lemma:(Nested Interval Property - NIP). For each $n ∈ N$, assume we are given a closed interval $I_n = [a_n, b_n]$. Assume also that each I_n contains I_{n+1}. Then, the resulting nested sequence of closed intervals   $$I_1 ⊇ I_2 ⊇ I_3 ⊇ I_4 ⊇ · · ·$$   has a nonempty intersection. Assume, for contradiction, that $\Bbb Q$ is countable. Thus we can write $\Bbb Q =\{r_1, r_2, r_3, . . .\}$ and, construct a nested sequence of closed intervals with $r_n \not \in  I_n$. Our construction implies $\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} I_n = ∅$ while NIP implies $\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} I_n \neq ∅$   . This contradiction implies $\Bbb Q$ must therefore be uncountable. Proof 02 Theorem : The open interval $(0,1)$ is uncountable. Proof: Lets assume that $(0,1)$ is countable and thus let $f:\Bbb N\to (0,1)$ be a bijective function.

Taken together, $(a)$ and $(b)$ clearly imply $A = B$. (The proof of both $(a)$ and $(b)$ is usually of the ‘take an arbitrary element’ variety. To prove $(a)$, for instance, we must prove $(\forall x \in A)(x \in B)$; so we take an arbitrary element $x$ of $A$ and show that $x$ must be an element of $B$.) Thanks!",,['elementary-set-theory']

Let $b$ be the infinite set of all nonnegative EVEN integers $0,2,4,6...$. If I take the sum of $a$ and divide it by the sum of $b$ do I get 2? Is this correct? Can one divide infinities like this? If yes, does this mean that SUM $a$ > SUM $b$ (despite that both are infinite)?
