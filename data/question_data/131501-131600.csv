(i) Show that the absolute difference of $a$ and $b$ is less than or equal to $2$ . (ii) Find all the pairs $(a, b)$ with the given properties. (From the National Mathematics Olympiad (Romania), 2012 – Grade 7 ). The first part ( i ) was quite easy to prove: $$(b^2-2a)\:\mid\:(a^2+2b)\text{ and }(a^2-2b)\:\mid\:(b^2+2a)$$ Since $(a, b)\in(\Bbb{N}^*\space \times\space \Bbb{N}^*)$ , both $a^2+2b$ and $b^2+2a$ are positive, and therefore $b^2-2a\le a^2+2b$ and $a^2-2b\le b^2+2a$ . Forming squares of binomials and switching from the RHS to the LHS and backwards: $$b^2-2b+1\le a^2+2a+1\implies(b-1)^2\le (a+1)^2$$ And since both $a$ and $b$ are positive, the sign does not change when taking the square root: $b-1\le a+1$ so $b\le a+2$ . Similarly, but working with the first relation, $a\le b+2$ . And thus, $|a-b|\le 2$ . So far so good, but (ii) is quite confusing to me, in the sense that I cannot think of an approach that doesn't lead to a lot by-hand checking and ""fluffy"" arithmetic. My attempt was to consider each case separately, so taking each $a$ in $\{b,\:b+1,\:b+2\}$ (of course assuming $a\ge b$ and then swapping each pair at the end and using what we proved at (ii) ). Since this method is (naturally) quite lengthy, it makes no sense to include it all in the question, but here are the results I obtained: $(a, b) \in \{(1, 1), (3, 3), (4, 4), (6, 6), (2, 4), (4, 2), (3, 5), (5, 3), (4, 6), (6, 4)\}$ I was wondering if there is another, hopefully better way of solving this ( ii )?

Assume $\sqrt{p}$ is rational, so that $\sqrt{p} = \frac{a}{b}$ , where $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$ , $b \neq 0$ and hcf $(a, b) = 1$ Then $a^2 = pb^2$ , so $a^2$ is divisible by $p$ .

The fact that $a$ and $b$ are both divisible by $p$ contradicts that hcf $(a, b) = 1$ . Therefore, $\sqrt{p}$ is irrational. In the proof, where do we use that $p$ is prime?

This is not a homework question, nor, as far as I know, a contest question. It is intended as a challenge for Year 10/11 or 15/16-year olds, but should require no knowledge of calculus. Readers will no doubt be familiar with the type of rate-of-work problem, often seen at elementary school, which goes like this: Alice can paint an $X$ metre-long fence in $A$ hours if she works on her own. Bob can paint the same fence in $B$ hours if he works on his own. If they work together, starting at opposite ends, how long will it take them to paint the fence? Solution : Every hour Alice will paint $\frac{X}{A}$ metres of fencing, and likewise Bob will paint $\frac{X}{B}$ metres. Together, without interference, they will paint $\frac{X}{A}+\frac{X}{B}$ metres and therefore the hours they take complete the job is $$\frac{X}{\frac{X}{A}+\frac{X}{B}}=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{A}+\frac{1}{B}}=\frac{AB}{A+B}$$ So far so good. But the following three-part question is not quite so obvious. QUESTION : A motorcycle’s wheels wear out tyres at constant, but different, rates. A tyre fitted to the front wheel will wear out after $F$ miles, and a tyre fitted to the back wheel will wear out after $B$ miles. a)  By swapping the tyres between front and back wheels, what is the maximum distance the owner can travel on just two tyres? When should she swap the tyres? b)  What is the maximum distance she can travel if she also has a spare tyre? When should she swap the tyres around? c)  The owner decides to fit a side-car to her motorcycle, and a tyre fitted to the side-car will wear out after $S$ miles. What is the maximum distance she can travel on the three tyres? When should she swap the tyres around? We assume, no doubt, that all the tyres are identical and all are brand new to start with, and that all tyres will be worn out by the time she has driven the maximum distance. In part a) we assume that the tyres are swapped just once, and that there will be two change-overs in parts b) and c). My Approach a)  Let the maximum distance be $D$ and let the distance travelled to the swap-over time be $x$. Let $r$ be the depth of rubber on each tyre, measured in mm. For each mile travelled, the back wheel loses $\frac{r}{B}$ mm of rubber. Therefore in travelling a distance $x$, the loss of rubber on this tyre is $\frac{rx}{B}$. At the point of swap-over, the remaining rubber on this tyre is $r-\frac{rx}{B}$ and this tyre will be fitted to the front wheel to travel the remaining distance $D-x$. When fitted to the front wheel, the loss of rubber for every mile is $$\frac{r}{F}=\frac{r-\frac{rx}{B}}{D-x}.$$ Rearranging this equation gives $$x=\frac{B(D-F)}{B-F}.$$ Since $x>0$, we have that either $B<D<F$ or $F<D<B$, which makes sense since we would expect the maximum journey to be less than $\max(B,F)$. We can now write down the equivalent expression if we consider the front tyre in exactly the same way, and then equate the different expressions for $x.$ Thus we have: $$\frac{B(D-F)}{B-F}=\frac{F(D-B)}{F-B}.$$ We can rearrange this and get an uncannily familiar-looking expression: $$D=\frac{2}{\frac{1}{F}+\frac{1}{B}}$$ When this is substituted back to get $x$, we get: $$x=\frac {1}{\frac{1}{F}+\frac{1}{B}}$$ Obviously this is exactly the same type of expression obtained in the Alice & Bob rate-of-work problem. And this is what suggests to me that there must be an easier and more intuitive method to obtain the result. Furthermore I don’t think it would be easy to apply my method to parts b) and c), so there must be an easier way. Can anyone give me a hint?

So, the possible roots are $x=0,\pm \sqrt{2}, -\dfrac{1}{2}$ , now my question is, how do I verify which roots satisfy the original equation, because one cannot see directly after plugging, whether it's true or not because it involves arctangents.

Correct solution: $(10.2+9.8)(10.2-9.8)=(20)(0.4)=8$ (Rule $3$) Student wrong (Marked as wrong) alternate solution: \begin{align*} (10+0.2)^2-(10-0.2)^2 &=[10^2+2(10)(0.2)+0.2^2]-[10^2-2(10)(0.2)+0.2^2]\\&=100+4+0.04-(100-4+0.04)\\&=104.04-96.04\\&=8\end{align*}(Rules $1$ and $2$) The question did NOT ask for the easiest and fastest way (and both solution uses ONLY rules of special products) to solve but yet why is student solution wrong? Teacher told us,""Aiya, why need to do so complicated one?"" yet she did not answer why is the answer wrong. I debated to her so long but to no avail.

Now obviously the trajectory resembles a parabola, and obviously the parabola's general shape (as in its coefficient a) depends on the cannon's angle, and (correct me if I am wrong, physicists) on how much Mario gets accelerated by the cannon. Some quick research said Mario's mass = 90kg = m_mario I couldn't really come up with a velocity through research, so I am just gonna assume that v = 20m/s v0 = 0m/s The acceleration from firing the cannon feels rather fast, so I am gonna assume a = (20-v0)/ 0.3 = 66m/s². Therefore, f_Cannon = 90*66 = 5940N (just in case that's gonna be of use later on) Now my first question is: I'm sure there must be a way of sort of ""converting"" the rotational angle and f_cannon into a correlating coefficient ""a"" for the parabola trajectory. I suspect trigonometric functions might be helpful, but I can't really think of a way to solve this problem. Question #2: I also wondered if it would be possible to find out what ""a"" would have to be equal to in oder for the parabola to have a specific root apart from x = 0 (assuming b = 1 and c = 0, always). Example: Say at x = 7 there is a power star, and Mario wants to collect the star hovering in the air just before he hits the ground at x = 7. if the parabola = ax²+x, then it is possible to find a: f(a) = 49a+7 a = (-7/49) Here are my personal figures for solving this problem How to find a for the root x = 7, assuming b = 1 and c = 0 Please excuse any mathematical errors of mine, I'm just your average freshman who likes math a lot, lol.

94,Can a product of a number and its reverse consist of only $1$'s?,Can a product of a number and its reverse consist of only 's?,1,"Problem: Let $n \gt 1$. If you write the digits of $n$ in reverse, then multiply by original $n$, is it possible for the product to consist only of $1$'s? This came from a competition I recently did, and I found this question quite interesting. Below is the proof I submitted. It's a little tedious in the middle, so feel free to correct any errors. Proof: Let $\bullet n$ denote reversed $n$. Assume $n$ has $k$-digits. Then $$n = 10^{k-1}a_1+10^{k-2}a_2 + \dots + 10a_{k-1}+a_k$$ where $0 \le a \le 9$, $a \in \mathbb Z$, and $a$ is the digit. $\bullet n$ multiplied by $n$: \begin{align} & \bullet n \cdot n \\ & = (10^{k-1}a_k + 10^{k-2}a_{k-1} + \dots)(10^{k-1}a_1+10^{k-2}a_2 + \dots) \\ & = 10^{2k-2}a_ka_1 + 10^{2k-3}a_ka_2 + 10^{2k-3}a_{k-1}a_1+\dots+10^{2k-k}a_1^2+10^{2k-k}a_2^2+\dots \\ & = 10^{2k-2}(a_ka_1) + 10^{2k-3}(a_ka_2 + a_{k-1}a_1)+\dots + 10^{k}(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \dots ) + \dots \\ \end{align} We now have the digits of the product of $\bullet n$ and $n$. Equate all digits to $1$: \begin{align} 1 & = a_ka_1 \tag{1} \\ 1 & = a_ka_2 + a_{k-1}a_1 \tag{2} \\ 1 & = a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \dots + a_{k-1}^2 + a_k^2 \tag{3} \\ \end{align} Observe $(1)$. $a_ka_1 = 1 \implies a_k = a_1 = 1$.
