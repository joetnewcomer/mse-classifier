7,Proving using definition that groups of orders up to $4$ are abelian.,Proving using definition that groups of orders up to  are abelian.,4,"I want to prove that the Groups of order upto 4 are abelian. I am not allowed to use concept of order of an element of a group. Let $\displaystyle G=\{e,a,b,c\}$ be a group of order $\displaystyle 4$ . By closure, $\displaystyle ab\in G$ . Clearly $\displaystyle ab\neq a,b$ ( as $\displaystyle ab=a\Longrightarrow b=e$ and similarly $\displaystyle ab\neq b$ ) so either $\displaystyle ab=e$ or $\displaystyle ab=c$ . Case 1: $\displaystyle ab=e$ It follows that $\displaystyle a^{-1} =b$ and thus our $\displaystyle G$ becomes $\displaystyle \{e,a,a^{-1} ,c\}$ . Again by closure $\displaystyle ac\in G\Longrightarrow ac\neq a,c,e$ . Since $\displaystyle ac=e\Longrightarrow a^{-1} =c$ , which is not possible as $\displaystyle a^{-1}$ and $\displaystyle c$ are distinct. So we must have $\displaystyle ac=a^{-1} \Longrightarrow c=a^{-2}$ . Thus our $\displaystyle G$ finally becomes $\displaystyle \{e,a,a^{-1} ,a^{-2} \}$ , which is clearly abelian. Case 2: $\displaystyle ab=c$ so that our $\displaystyle G$ becomes $\displaystyle \{e,a,b,ab\}$ . Clearly, $\displaystyle a^{2} \neq a,ab$ .

And if $\displaystyle a^{2} =e$ , then $\displaystyle ab^{2} \neq ab,b$ so either $\displaystyle ab^{2} =e$ or $\displaystyle a$ . If $\displaystyle ab^{2} =e$ then $\displaystyle a^{2} b^{2} =a=b^{2}$ , and the group becomes $\displaystyle \{e,b^{2} ,b,b^{3} \}$ , which is abelian. And if $\displaystyle ab^{2} =a$ then $\displaystyle b^{2} =e$ . $\displaystyle ( ab)( ba) =ab^{2} a=aea=e\Longrightarrow ( ab)^{-1} =ba$ . $\displaystyle ba\neq a,b$ and $\displaystyle ba\neq e$ as $\displaystyle ba=e\Longrightarrow ab( ba) =ab=e$ , which is not possible.

Essentially, if we think of $X\times Y$ as an array of ordered pairs with $X$ - and $Y$ -coordinates, then $A^Y$ has a copy of $A$ for each row to act on the elements within the rows independently, and $B$ permutes the rows themselves.

It goes: Let $G$ be a group such that $(ab)^p = a^p b^p$ for all $a, b \in G$ , where $p$ is a prime number. Let $S = \{ x \in G \mid x^{p^m} = e\text{ for some } m \text{ depending on }x\}$ . Prove: (a) $S$ is normal in $G$ ; (b) If $\overline{G} = G/S$ and if $\overline{x} \in \overline{G}$ is such that $\overline{x}^p = \overline{e}$ then $\overline{x} = \overline{e}$ My solution (a) $S$ is closed: if $x, y \in S$ , there are some $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $x^{p^m} = y^{p^n} = e$ . Therefore, if we take $m+n \in \mathbb{N}$ , $(xy)^{p^{m+n}} = x^{p^{m+n}} y^{p^{m+n}}$ (this can be proved by induction) $= (x^{p^{m}})^{p^n}(y^{p^n})^{p^m} = e$ $e \in S$ , trivially If $x \in S$ , you can take the same $m \in \mathbb{N}$ for $x^{-1}$ If $x \in S$ and $g \in G$ , $(gxg^{-1})^{p^m} = gx^{p^m}g^{-1} = e$ , so $S$ is normal in $G$ (b) If $\overline{x}^p = \overline{e}$ , then $x^p \in S$ , which means there is some $m \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $(x^p)^{p^m} = e$ , meaning $x^{p^{m+1}} = e$ , and so $x \in S \iff \overline{x} = \overline{e}$ The induction proof For $m = 1$ , the claim is clear by hypothesis. If $(xy)^{p^k} = x^{p^k}y^{p^k}$ for all $k$ up to $m \in \mathbb{N}$ , then $(xy)^{p^m} = (xy)^{p^{m-1}*p} = ((xy)^{p^{m-1}})^p = (x^{p^{m-1}}y^{p^{m-1}})^p = x^{p^m}y^{p^m}$ , which concludes the proof.

Now, properties s1 to s7 are not contradictory, because the group possesses them. (By the way, properties s1 to s7 are not independent : s3 can be deduced from s1, s2 and s5, using the N/C lemma.) My question is : do you see how the statement "" is contained in just one Sylow 2-subgroup, namely "" can be proved in the frame of Mark Reeder's proof ? Thanks in advance. Note : I wrote up M. Reeder's proof by breaking it down into simple elements and indicating, for each element, the minimum hypotheses. If anyone is interested, I can post this work here.

27,Why can the irreducible representations of $SU(N)$ be obtained in this way?,Why can the irreducible representations of  be obtained in this way?,SU(N),"Let us consider the group $SU(N)$ . Recently watching a recorded lecture in group theory for physicists I've heard about the following. Take the definining representation of $SU(N)$ , namely, $(\rho,V)$ where $V=\mathbb{C}^N$ and where $\rho : SU(N)\to \operatorname{GL}(\mathbb{C}^N)$ is just the inclusion map, i.e., for every $g\in SU(N)$ we have $\rho(g)$ act upon $v\in \mathbb{C}^N$ by usual matrix multiplication. Now take the $r$ -fold tensor product $V^{\otimes r}$ . The representation $\rho$ naturally induces one representation on $V^{\otimes r}$ which is characterized on decomposable tensors as $$[\rho^{\otimes r}(g)](v_1\otimes\cdots \otimes v_r)=(\rho(g)v_1)\otimes\cdots \otimes (\rho(g)v_r).\tag{1}$$ On the other hand, the symmetric group $S_r$ naturally acts on $V^{\otimes r}$ . Its action on decomposable tensors is $$\pi(\sigma)(v_1\otimes\cdots\otimes v_r) = v_{\sigma(1)}\otimes\cdots\otimes v_{\sigma(r)}.\tag{2}$$ We may further show that the two actions commute. This is clear on decomposable tensors. We just apply $\pi(\sigma)$ to (1) and apply $\rho^{\otimes r}(g)$ to (2) and compare. Since decomposable tensors span $V^{\otimes r}$ and since $\rho^{\otimes r}(g)$ and $\pi(\sigma)$ are linear, the two operations must commute applied to anything. Now I've heard that because of this, if we decompose $V^{\otimes r}$ in a direct sum of irreducible representations of $S_r$ the irreducible factors also give rise to irreducible representations of $SU(N)$ . In other words, decompose $$V^{\otimes r}=\bigoplus_\lambda {\cal W}_\lambda,$$ where ${\cal W}_\lambda$ are irreducible representations of $S_r$ , then ${\cal W}_{\lambda}$ is invariant under $\rho^{\otimes r}$ and, moreover, the subrepresentation of $\rho^{\otimes r}$ so obtained is irreducible.

Let $\phi_k^a$ be the standard exponential coordinates for a group element $k$ . Consider the following sum of group elements in any subgroup $K\subseteq G$ (sums over $a,b$ implied): $$ \sum_{k\in K} \exp{(\phi^a_k L^a)} $$ This sum is proportional to the projection onto any trivial irreps of $K$ in the irrep of $G$ , so it is invariant under any conjugation by $r \in K$ . Let's expand it in the generators, obtaining the following quadratic leading-order term (the linear term cancels since for any $k\in K$ , the inverse is also in the sum): $$ \left(\sum_{k\in K}\phi_{k}^{a}\phi_{k}^{b}\right)L^{a}L^{b}\equiv f^{ab}L^{a}L^{b} $$ I conjecture that the above quantity is also invariant under conjugation by $r \in K$ .

35,Solving the Rubik cube with given initial and target states (generalization of standard Rubik cube),Solving the Rubik cube with given initial and target states (generalization of standard Rubik cube),,"Consider the generalization of the Rubik cube problem, where we are given an initial state $A$ and a final state $B$ , and we search for a path between the two. We can easily show that given $A$ and $B$ , one can compute $X$ such that the path from $X$ to $S$ is the same as the path from $A$ to $B$ .  Here, $S$ denotes the standard solved state. Now, is there a simple and convenient way to represent this isomorphism between the group subsumed by $A$ and $B$ and the group subsumed by $X$ and $S$ ? Let $G_1$ be the group such that $A$ and $B$ are members of $G_1$ . Accordingly, let $G_2$ be the group such that $X$ and $S$ are members of $G_2$ . How to characterize the isomorphism between $G_1$ and $G_2$ , which maps $A$ to $X$ and $B$ to $S$ ? The isomorphism basically consists in recoloring the minicubes in $A$ to generate $X$ in  such a way that the solution (path) from $X$ to $S$ is the same as the solution from $A$ to $B$ .  Note that we are able to compute $X$ without solving the Rubik cube problem, which is nice, because actually $X$ and $S$ may be in a different connected component than $A$ and $B$ . Correspondingly, we are searching for an isomorphism that does not require that $A$ and $B$ be in the same connected component as $X$ and $S$ . Naturally, the isomorphism cannot rely on solving the Rubik cube, as the solution would forcefully require the four elements to be in the same connected component. As an example, consider the following initial state $A$ , depicted below, The goal is to find a path to state $B$ , below This is equivalent to finding a path from state $X$ below to the canonical target state $S$ How to describe, using the language of group theory, the isomorphism that maps $A$ into $X$ and that maps $B$ into the canonical target state $S$ ? In what follows, we focus on the simplest case wherein $A$ , $B$ , $X$ and $S$ are all in the same connected component.   The possible configurations that we can get by manipulating a cube in configuration $A$ is the ""orbit"" of $A$ .  So, we're saying that in what follows the orbit of $A$ (which includes $B$ ) must be the same as the orbit of $S$ (which includes $X$ ). We can think about each configuration of the cube as being an alias to a sequence of moves that brings that configuration to the canonical solved state $S$ . Say that we refer to $M1$ as the sequence of moves that brings $A$ to the solved state $S$ , and we refer to $M2$ as the sequence of moves that brings $B$ to the solved state $S$ . Then, the sequence of moves that brings $A$ to $B$ is $M1 M2^{-1}$ and $ A$ maps to $M1$ and $B$ maps to $M2$ in the same way that $X$ maps to $M1 M2^{-1}$ and $S$ maps to $M2 M2^{-1} $ which is the identity element. Now, to build this mapping between $A$ and $X$ and between $B$ and $S$ we had to take the original sequence of moves and multiply each of those by $M2^{-1}$ (assuming operations are applied from left to right, otherwise, we would get $M2^{-1}M1$ as the mapping of $X$ instead of $M1 M2^{-1}$ ) I'd be curious to know if there is an alternative way to represent that mapping, which does not rely on knowing the sequence of moves $M2^{-1}$ . We can write a computer program to build $X$ from $A$ and $B$ without knowing $M1$ and $M2$ , but I don't know how to represent the operator that this program is implementing using the language of group theory. Is there an operator that maps states without necessarily sticking to the cube rules, but which allows to map $A$ into $X$ and $B$ into $S$ without knowing $M2$ ? I believe this operator is a sort of  exogenous or ""out of band"" operator in the group elements, leveraging side information about alternative representations of the elements of the groups.","Consider the generalization of the Rubik cube problem, where we are given an initial state and a final state , and we search for a path between the two.

We then dualise with respect to $H$ , to get the dual sequence: $$ 0 \to \textrm{Hom}(G,H) \stackrel{f_0^*}\to \textrm{Hom}(F_0,H) \stackrel{f_1^*}\to \textrm{Hom}(F_1,H) \to 0, $$ where $f_0^*$ and $f_1^*$ represent the naturally induced dual maps. The corresponding Ext groups are then defined as: $$ \textrm{Ext}^0(G,H) := \textrm{Ker}(f_1^*) $$ and $$ \textrm{Ext}^1(G,H) := \textrm{Coker}(f_1^*). $$ An example: We compute $\textrm{Ext}(\mathbb{Z}_p,\mathbb{Z})$ : We note that: $$ 0 \to \mathbb{Z} \stackrel{\cdot p}\to \mathbb{Z} \stackrel{1 \mapsto 1}\to \mathbb{Z}_p \to 0 $$ is a free resolution of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ .

For the sake of simplicity, let us first compute $\textrm{Ext}(\mathbb{Z}_p,\mathbb{Z}_q)$ for $p$ and $q$ distinct primes. A free resolution for $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is given, as above, by: $$ 0 \to \mathbb{Z} \stackrel{\cdot p}\to \mathbb{Z} \stackrel{1 \mapsto 1}\to \mathbb{Z}_p \to 0 $$ Dualising with respect to $\mathbb{Z}_q$ gives us: $$ 0 \to \textrm{Hom}(\mathbb{Z}_p,\mathbb{Z}_q) \to \textrm{Hom}(\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{Z}_q) \stackrel{\cdot p^*}\to \textrm{Hom}(\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{Z}_q) \to 0, $$ which necessarily must reduce to: $$ 0 \to 0 \to 0 \stackrel{0}\to 0 \to 0, $$ so that: $$ \textrm{Ext}^0(\mathbb{Z}_p,\mathbb{Z}_q) := \textrm{Ker}(0) = 0 $$ and $$ \textrm{Ext}^1(\mathbb{Z}_p,\mathbb{Z}_q) := \textrm{Coker}(0) = 0. $$ Now for the more general $\textrm{Ext}(\mathbb{Z}_m,\mathbb{Z}_n)$ .

Prove that it is impossible to cover remaining cells with dominoes $2\times1$ .

However, there is another proof via geometric group theory: for each cell write $a, b, a^{-1}, b^{-1}$ on its left, upper, right, lower border correspondingly.  Suppose that chessboard without two opposite corners can be covered by dominoes. That would mean that any two elements $a, b$ of any group satisfying $a^2 b a^{-2} b^{-1}=1$ and $ab^2a^{-1}b^{-2} = 1$ will also satisfy $a^7 b a b^7 a^{-7} b^{-1} a^{-1} b^{-7}=1$ .

The proof looks simple, so I was attracted to it. Here is the proof after I filled in the details. Everything in $A_n$ can be generated by $3$ -cycles. To see this, just note that $$ (12)(13)=(123),(13)(24)=(123)(234). $$ We now show that every non-trivial normal subgroup of $A_n$ contains a $3$ -cycle. Let $\alpha\in A_n$ be an element which permutes the least number of elements in $\{1,2,\ldots, n\}$ . We show that $\alpha$ is a $3$ -cycle. $\alpha$ cannot be the product of two disjoint order 2 cycles since if $\alpha=(12)(34), \beta=(345)$ , then $\beta^{-1}\alpha^{-1}\beta\alpha=(345)$ , contradicting the minimality of $\alpha$ .   If $\alpha=(12)(34)(56)$ , let $\beta=(123)$ . In general, $\alpha$ can not be the product of disjoint order 2 cycles. Now, we know that the only two cases are $$ \alpha=(1234...)\text{ or } \alpha(123)(45...) $$ the former one must permute at least $5$ elements; the later must permute at least $6$ elements. However, in the former case let $\beta=(234)$ and in the latter case let $\beta=(132)$ . Calculating $\beta^{-1}\alpha^{-1}\beta\alpha$ in both cases gives $(143)$ and $(15324)$ , which leads to a contradiction, because they permute less elements than $\alpha$ . Finally, note that any two 3-cycles are conjugate to each other. So any normal subgroup is the entire $A_n$ .

Why are we interested in the commutator $\beta^{-1}\alpha^{-1}\beta\alpha$ ? It makes sense to consider $\beta^{-1}\alpha\beta$ since it is related to the definition of normal subgroups.

Now, G.E Wall had described the conjugacy classes of these groups(over any field though). Now, I need to verify my understanding of conjugacy class of $U(n,q)$ . This is what I understand: (1) One defines a certain set of monic polynomials in $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}[x]$ as follows: If $f\in \mathbb{F}_{q^2}[x]$ , then define the dual of $f$ as $\tilde{f}(x)=\frac{1}{f(0)^c}x^{deg(f)}f^{c}(x^{-1})$ . In other words, $\tilde{f}$ is such that: $\alpha$ is a root of $f$ iff $\alpha^{-q}$ is a root of $\tilde{f}$ . We call $f$ self-dual if $f=\tilde{f}$ . (2) Now, $K=\bigcup\limits_{g\in GL(n,q^2)} gU(n,q^2)g^{-1}$ is a normal subset of $GL(n,q^2)$ , and hence a union of conjugacy classes of $GL(n,q^2)$ . Now, by the theory of rational canonical forms, one can associate a combinatorial data to an element $T\in GL(n,q^2)$ , as follows: If $\Phi$ is the set of all irreducible polynomials in $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ except $x$ , then the combinatorial data of $T$ denoted by $\Delta_T$ is: for $\phi \in \Phi$ , (a) a partition $\lambda_{\phi}$ of $|\lambda_{\phi}|$ (b) $\sum\limits_{\phi \in \Phi} deg(\phi)|\lambda_{\phi}|=n$ . Now, By the theory of Wall, a conjugacy class $C$ of $GL(n,q^2)$ belongs to $K$ iff the combinatorial data is as follows: for $\phi \in \Phi$ , (a) a partition $\lambda_{\phi}$ of $|\lambda_{\phi}|$ (b) $\lambda_{\phi}=\lambda_{\tilde{\phi}}$ (c) $\sum\limits_{\phi \in \Phi} deg(\phi)|\lambda_{\phi}|=n$ . It is clear that $\phi$ is irreducible iff $\tilde{\phi}$ is irreducible. (3) Finally, it also asserts the following: Suppose $C$ be a conjugacy class of $GL(n,q^2)$ residing in $K$ . Then $C$ is as described in (2). Suppose $\emptyset \neq L\subset C$ is the part of $C$ contained in $U(n,q)$ , then $L$ is a complete conjugacy class in $U(n,q)$ , that is, it doesn't split further as $U(n,q)$ -conjugacy class. It is implicit that for each conjugacy class $C$ as described above, there always exists a non-empty $L$ as above. This completely describes the conjugacy class in $U(n,q)$ . This kind of description can be found in several papers. For Example: In several papers of J.Fulman and others. But since the writing is much compact, I had expanded it in my own way. It is a big post and I will be very thankful if anyone can patiently read this and clarify me if my understanding is correct.

I think I am clear on how to tackle Part (a). And, this is my Mathematics Stack Exchange post on Part (b). So here I will only be attempting Part (c). My Attempt: Suppose our group $G$ has five distinct elements, say, $e, a, b, c, d$ , with $e$ being the identity element. Now suppose, if possible, that $ab \neq ba$ . As the elements $e, a, b, c, d$ of $G$ are all distinct, so by virtue of the cancellation laws (i.e. Lemma 2.3.2 in Herstein), we cannot have $ab = a$ , $ab = b$ , $ba = a$ , or $ba = b$ . Therefore we must $ab, ba \in \{ e, c, d \}$ . Since $ab \neq ba$ by our supposition, therefore without loss of generality we have the following two cases: Case 1. Suppose that $ab = c$ [Or, we can also have $ab = d$ .] and $ba = e$ . Thus our group $G$ has the five distinct elements $e, a, b, ab, d$ . Since $ba = e$ , we also have $$ a = ae = a(ba). \tag{1} $$ However, since $G$ is a group, we must have $$ a(ba) = (ab)a. \tag{2} $$ From (1) and (2) above, we obtain $$ a = (ab)a, $$ from which we obtain $$ e = ab, $$ again by Lemma 2.3.2 in Herstein. This contradicts the fact that $e$ and $ab$ are two distinct elements of $G$ . So our supposition that $ab \neq ba$ is wrong. Therefore we must have $$ ab = ba. $$ Case 2. Suppose that $ab = c$ and $ba = d$ . [Or, vice versa.] Then our group $G$ has the five distinct elements $e, a, b, ab, ba$ . By Lemma 2.3.2 in Herstein, $a^2$ cannot equal $a$ (for otherwise $a$ would equal $e$ , which is contrary to our choice), nor can $a^2$ equal $ab$ or $ba$ (for otherwise $a$ would equal $b$ , again contrary to our choice). So we must have $a^2 = b$ or $a^2 = e$ . However, if $a^2 = b$ , then we obtain $$ ab = aa^2 = a^3 = a^2a = ba, $$ which is contrary to our supposition that $ab \neq ba$ . So we must have $a^2 = e$ , which implies that $a^{-1} = a$ . Similarly, we also have $b^2 = e$ , which implies that $b^{-1} = b$ . Therefore we have $$ (ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1} = ba. \tag{3} $$ Now consider $(ab)a$ .  By the closure property of our group $G$ , $(ab)a$ must be one of the elements $e, a, b, ab, ba$ . However we show in the following paragraphs that each of these possibilities leads to a contradiction. We note that if $(ab)a = e$ , then $(ab)^{-1} =a$ , and thus from (3) above (and the uniqueness of the inverse of each element in a group) we obtain $ba = a$ , a contradiction. So $$ (ab)a \neq e. $$ If $(ab)a = a$ , then we obtain $ab = e$ , a contradiction. So $$ (ab)a \neq a. $$ If $(ab)a = b$ , then we obtain $$ ab = abe = aba^2 = [(ab)a]a = ba, $$ again a contradiction to our supposition that $ab \neq ba$ . So $$ (ab)a \neq b. $$ If $(ab)a = ab$ , then we obtain $a = e$ , a contradiction. So $$ (ab)a \neq ab.$$ Finally, if $$ (ab)a = ba, $$ then we obtain $$ a(ba) = ba, $$ which implies $$ a = e, $$ a contradiction. So $$ (ab)a \neq ba.$$ Thus we have shown that, in either of Cases 1 and 2 above, our supposition that $ab \neq ba$ has led to contradictions. So we must have $$ ab = ba. $$ An analogous argument yields $bc = cb$ , $bd = db$ , $ac = ca$ , $cd = dc$ . Thus any two of the elements $a, b, c, d$ of $G$ commute.

Define the projection operator $\,P_u\,$ so that a function $\,P_u\varphi\,$ coincides with $\,\varphi\,$ on $\,B\, u\, K\,$ and is zero outside it.

This restriction is equivalent to an assumption that in condition (12) we must restrict, by hand, $\,q\,$ from $\,K_u\,$ to $\,L_u\,$ . Or to enforce an equivalent restriction of $\,k\,$ in $\,D(K)\,$ . Or to restrict the domain of $\,\Phi\,$ to $\,B\,$ in (12). Why should we do that? The desired restriction of the induced representation to $\,B\,$ implies that the left translations must be performed by the elements $\,b\in B\,$ . I, however, see no reason why we also should restrict to $\,B\,$ the domain of the functions $\,\Phi\,$ on which this restricted representation acts. PS. A possible clue to this problem may lie in the following observation. The subgroup $\,L_u\,$ and the quotient space $\,B/L_u\,$ naturally emerge when we split a double coset $\,BuK\,$ into left cosets $\,\textsf{b}uK\,$ . Indeed, if some $\,b\,$ and $\,b_1\,$ lie in the same left coset, $$ b~u~K~=~b_1~u~K~~, $$ then $$ b~K_u~=~b_1~K_u~~~ $$ or, equivalently, $$ b_1^{-1}b~K_u~=~K_u~~. $$ This obviously entails $\,b_1^{-1}b\,\in\,K_u\,$ , wherefrom $$ b^{-1}_1b\,\in\,L_u~~. $$ So the left cosets $\,b\, u\, K\,$ and $\,b_1 u\, K\,$ coincide iff $\,b\,$ and $\,b_1\,$ belong to the same left coset in the quotient space $\,B/L_u\;$ , $\,$ with some  representative $\,\textsf{b}\,$ : $$  b\,,\,b_1\,\in\,\textsf{b}\,{{L}}_{u}\;\,,\;\;\,\textsf{b}\,\in\,B $$ Thus, as many left cosets $\,\textsf{b}\, L_u\,$ in the quotient space $\,B/L_u\,$ so many left cosets $\,X\,=\, \textsf{b}\, u\, K\,$ in the double coset $\,{\cal{U}}=BuK\,$ . We also can say that if $\,b\,$ lies in the left coset $\,b\, u\, K\,$ , then $$ b~=~\textsf{b}~l~~,~~~l\in L_u~~, $$ where $\,\textsf{b}\,$ is a representative of the left coset $\,\textsf{b}\,L_u\,$ . Thence, $$ \Phi_u(b)~=~D_u^{-1}(l)~\Phi_u(\textsf{b})~~,~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\qquad\qquad(17) $$ so the function $\,\Phi_u\,$ is fully defined by its values on a section of the quotient space $\,B/L_u\,$ . This could have answered my question if not for one circumstance: in eqn (12) we still have $\,q\,$ which lies in $\,K_u\,$ , not in $\,L_u\,$ . So equation (17) becomes $$ \Phi(bq)~=~D_u^{-1}(lq)~\Phi_u(\textsf{b})~~, $$ and the subrepresentation is defined not on $\,L_u\,$ but on $\,K_u\,$ -- unless we fix this `` by hand'' (but on what grounds?)","Denote with the space of all continuous functions mapping the elements of a Lie group to some vector space : Consider a subgroup and its representation by linear operators on : It can be induced to the representation on the subspace of functions obeying We now restrict the induced representation to a subgroup .

The $p$ -subgroup of $A$ as the set $A(p) := \{\,a \in A \, \mid \, p^k a = 0 \hspace{1mm} \text{for some} \hspace{1mm} k \in \mathbb{N}\,\}$ . I've proven these are all subgroups of $A$ . It is known that $A(p) = \{\,a \in A \, \mid \, o(a) = p^k \hspace{1mm} \text{for some} \hspace{1mm} k \in \mathbb{N}\,\}$ . Now we want to prove the following statement considering $A := \mathbb{Z}_n$ . Square brackets (or a bar if it's a single letter) denote the equivalence class of an element in $\mathbb{Z}_n$ , whereas the angle brackets denote the subgroup genereated by the element within them and finally the $\simeq$ symbol denotes an isomorphism. $m\mathbb{Z}_n = \gcd(n,m)\mathbb{Z}_n = \langle [\gcd(n,m)] \rangle \simeq \mathbb{Z}_\frac{n}{\gcd(n,m)}$ $\mathbb{Z}_n[m] = \mathbb{Z}_n[\gcd(n,m)] = \langle [\frac{n}{\gcd(n,m)}] \rangle \simeq \mathbb{Z}_{\gcd(n,m)}$ If $n = p^r n'$ and $p \nmid n'$ (not divides), then $\mathbb{Z}_n(p) = \langle n' \rangle \simeq \mathbb{Z}_{p^r}$ I've tried to solve it in this way. First of all, we have that $\gcd(n,m) \mid m$ , so there exists $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $m = \gcd(n,m)k$ . Given an element $\bar{x} \in m\mathbb{Z}_n$ , by definition there exists $\bar{a} \in \mathbb{Z}_n$ such that $\bar{x} = m \bar{a}$ and therefore $\bar{x} = \gcd(n,m)k\bar{a} = \gcd(n,m)[ka]$ . This proves that $\bar{x} \in \gcd(n,m)\mathbb{Z}_n$ , thus $m\mathbb{Z}_n \subseteq \gcd(n,m)\mathbb{Z}_n$ . I was not able to prove the inclusion $\supseteq$ though. Then I guess I solved the equality $\gcd(n,m) = \langle [\gcd(n,m)] \rangle$ . In fact (tell me if I'm mistaken somewhere): \begin{align}  \gcd(n,m)\mathbb{Z}_n & = \{\,\gcd(n,m)\bar{a} \, \mid \, \bar{a} \in \mathbb{Z}_n\,\} \\ & = \{\,[\gcd(n,m)a] \, \mid \, a \in \mathbb{Z}\,\} \\ & = \{\,a[\gcd(n,m)] \, \mid \, a \in \mathbb{Z}\,\} = \langle [\gcd(n,m)] \rangle \end{align} For the isomorphism part, let $f \colon \langle [\gcd(n,m)] \rangle \to \mathbb{Z}_{\frac{n}{\gcd(n,m)}}$ be the map defined by $f(k[\gcd(n,m)]) := \bar{k}$ . This is trivially a surjective homomorphism. It is injective, too, since: \begin{align}  \ker{f} & = \{\,k[\gcd(n,m)] \in \langle [\gcd(n,m)] \rangle \, \mid \, f(k[\gcd(n,m)]) = \bar{0}\,\} \\ & = \{\,k[\gcd(n,m)] \in \langle [\gcd(n,m)] \rangle \, \mid \, \bar{k} = \bar{0}\,\} \\ & = \{\,nh[\gcd(n,m)] \in \langle [\gcd(n,m)] \rangle \, \mid \, h \in \mathbb{Z}\,\} \\ & = \{\,h\gcd(n,m)\bar{n} \in \langle [\gcd(n,m)] \rangle \, \mid \, h \in \mathbb{Z}\,\} = \{\bar{0}\} \end{align} Am I on the right track or is there a better way to prove this stuff? And if this is the right way, how can I complete this proof including statement 2. and 3.? Edit: I found a better way to prove all isomorphisms. I use this result (the order of an element $a \in G$ is denoted by $o(a)$ ): Let $G$ be a cyclic group, $G = \langle a \rangle$ . If $o(a) = n$ , then $G \simeq \mathbb{Z}_n$ . Now one easily verifies the following conditions: $o([\gcd(n,m)]) = \frac{n}{\gcd(n,m)}$ $o([\frac{n}{\gcd(n,m)}]) = \gcd(n,m)$ $o([n']) = p^r$ So I only need to prove the equalities now if my reasoning is correct.","Disclaimer: this terminology might be different from what you're used to and this is why I'm writing down some definitions first.

Then, I reformulate as follows. Given a permutation $\sigma \in S_n$ , let's consider the cyclic subgroup generated by $\sigma$ , $\langle \sigma \rangle = \lbrace \sigma^k, k=1,\dots,o(\sigma) \rbrace \le S_n$ , and its action on the set $I_n=\lbrace 1,\dots,n \rbrace$ . The orbit by $j \in I_n$ induced by this action is given by the collection $O_\sigma(j)=\lbrace \sigma^k(j), k=1,\dots,o(\sigma) \rbrace \subseteq I_n$ . By the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem, the size of the orbit -namely the cardinality of the set $O_\sigma(j)$ - is given by: $$|O_\sigma(j)|=\frac{o(\sigma)}{|\mathcal{Fix}_\sigma(j)|}=[\langle\sigma\rangle:\mathcal{Fix}_\sigma(j)] \tag 1$$ where $\mathcal{Fix_\sigma(j)}:=\lbrace \sigma^k \in \langle\sigma\rangle \mid \sigma^k(j)=j \rbrace \le \langle \sigma \rangle$ . Furthermore, the number of the orbits is given by: $$|\mathcal{O}_\sigma| = \frac{\sum_{j \in I_n}|\mathcal{Fix}_\sigma(j)|}{o(\sigma)} \tag 2$$ where $\mathcal{O}_\sigma:=\lbrace O_\sigma(j), j \in I_n\rbrace$ . Lemma. $\forall \sigma \in S_n, \forall j \in I_n$ , $\exists l, 1 \le l \le o(\sigma)$ , such that $\sigma^i(j) \ne \sigma^k(j), \forall i,k, 1 \le i< k \le l$ . Proof. Call $V_\sigma(j):=\lbrace k \in I_{o(\sigma)} \mid \sigma^k(j)=j \rbrace$ ; note that $1 \le o(\sigma) \in V_\sigma(j)$ , so that $V_\sigma(j) \cap \mathbb{Z}_+ \ne \emptyset$ . For the Well-Ordering Principle, $\exists m=m(\sigma,j)$ such that $m=\operatorname{min}V_\sigma(j)$ . Suppose, by contrapositive, that $\exists i,k, 1 \le i < k \le m$ such that $\sigma^i(j)=\sigma^k(j)$ ; then, $\sigma^{k-i}(j)=j$ and then $k-i \in V_\sigma(j)$ ; but $i \ge 1 \Rightarrow -i \le -1 \Rightarrow k-i \le k-1 \le m-1 < m = \operatorname{min}V_\sigma(j) \Rightarrow$ $k-i \notin V_\sigma(j)$ : contradiction. Therefore, the positive integer $m$ is the $l$ claimed in the Lemma. $\Box$ In turn, the positive integer $l=l(\sigma,j)$ claimed in the Lemma is $|O_\sigma(j)|$ given by $(1)$ .

80,Generalization of normal subgroup,Generalization of normal subgroup,,"I am wondering whether the following concept appears in the group theory literature under some (perhaps different) name. Let $G$ be a group and let $A,B$ be subgroups of $G$ . Definition. Say that $(A,B)$ is a normal pair if $[A,B]\subseteq A\cap B$ . Here, $[A,B]$ denotes the group generated by the commutators $\{[a,b]\colon a\in A,b\in B\}$ . Thus, the condition is equivalent to requiring that $[a,b]\in A\cap B$ for all $a\in A$ and $b\in B$ . Yet another equivalent condition is that $bA=Ab$ and $aB=Ba$ for all $a,b$ . Note that while $A,B$ are required to be subgroups of a common group, the definition is intrinsic to $A$ and $B$ in the sense that for all groups $G,H$ containing $A\cup B$ we have that $(A,B)$ is a normal pair when regarded as subgroups of $G$ if and only if it is a normal pair when regarded as subgroups of $H$ . The concept of a normal pair generalizes the concept of a normal subgroup. Indeed, $N\trianglelefteq  G$ is equivalent to $N$ being a subgroup of $G$ for which $(G,N)$ is a normal pair. One nice consequence of the definition is that whenever $(A,B)$ is a normal pair, $[A,B]\trianglelefteq A\cap B$ . So even though we started by just assuming a subgroup relationship, it was upgraded to a normal subgroup ""for free"" (see diagram below). To see why this is the case, note (by the previous paragraph) that it suffices to show that $$(A,B)\text{ is a normal pair}\implies([A,B],A\cap B)\text{ is a normal pair}.$$ It is clear that given the hypothesis, $\bigl[[A,B],A\cap B\bigr]\subseteq [A\cap B,A\cap B]$ . The latter group is immediately seen to lie both in $A\cap B$ as well as $[A,B]$ . This proves the claim. In fact, one can go even further and observe that the factor group $$\frac{A\cap B}{[A,B]}$$ (which is well-defined due to the previous paragraph) is always abelian. Indeed, it is a general fact (directly from the definitions) that a quotient group $G/N$ is abelian if and only if $[G,G]\subseteq N$ . Applied to $G=A\cap B$ and $N=[A,B]$ , it yields the claim. Similar reasoning shows that if $(A,B)$ is a normal pair, then not only is $[A,B]$ a normal subgroup of $A\cap B$ , but it is also a normal subgroup of $A$ (and therefore $B$ , by symmetry). Indeed, $[[A,B],A]\subseteq [A\cap B,A]$ and the latter subgroup is seen to be contained in both $A$ and $[A,B]$ . However, contrasting with the situation in the previous paragraph, $A/[A,B]$ is no longer necessarily abelian - for example, consider the normal pair $(G,\{\textrm{id}\})$ for any non-abelian group $G$ . Following the spirit that ""everything in sight is normal"", it also follows from normality of the pair $(A,B)$ that $A\cap B$ is a normal subgroup of $A$ (and therefore $B$ , by symmetry). Indeed, $[A,A\cap B]\subseteq A$ is clear and $[A,A\cap B]\subseteq [A,B]\subseteq A\cap B$ establishes the claim. (Note that this case of normality is implied by what we have already established in previous paragraphs as well.) Relations entailed by a normal pair $(A,B)$ : Legend: lines indicate normal subgroups (lower object contained in upper object) and $\Diamond$ means that the quotient group is abelian.
