6,Questions regarding Riemann's rearrangement theorem,Questions regarding Riemann's rearrangement theorem,,"I have recently learned about Riemann's rearrangement theorem, and I have some questions regarding the theorem. Let $$\sum a_n = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + \cdots$$ be conditionally convergent.

Then my (obviously wrong) claim is this: A rearrangment is just repeated switching of terms. Why is my claim wrong? I can imagine that it has something to do with the fact that for many rearrangements one has to switch two terms infinitely many times. If that is the case, I guess that one can do any finite amount of switching without altering the sum. Is this correct?

I was starting to study the cubic analogue $ \sum_{k\geq 1}\left(\zeta(m)-H_{k}^{(m)}\right)^3 $ and I managed to prove through summation by parts that $$ \sum_{k\geq 1}\frac{\left(H_k^{(2)}\right)^2}{k^2} =\frac{1}{3}\zeta(2)^3-\frac{2}{3}\zeta(6)+\zeta(3)^2 $$ where the LHS, according to Flajolet and Salvy 's notation, is $S_{22,2}$.

On the other hand, Mike Spivey's approach is extremely lengthy, and I would be happy to see a more efficient derivation of $S_{12,2}=\zeta(2)\,\zeta(3)+\zeta(5)$.","An interesting investigation started here and it showed that $$ \sum_{k\geq 1}\left(\zeta(m)-H_{k}^{(m)}\right)^2 $$ has a closed form in terms of values of the Riemann $\zeta$ function for any integer $m\geq 2$. I was starting to study the cubic analogue $ \sum_{k\geq 1}\left(\zeta(m)-H_{k}^{(m)}\right)^3 $ and I managed to prove through summation by parts that $$ \sum_{k\geq 1}\frac{\left(H_k^{(2)}\right)^2}{k^2} =\frac{1}{3}\zeta(2)^3-\frac{2}{3}\zeta(6)+\zeta(3)^2 $$ where the LHS, according to Flajolet and Salvy 's notation, is $S_{22,2}$. An explicit evaluation of $\sum_{k\geq 1}\left(\zeta(2)-H_{k}^{(2)}\right)^3 $ is completed by the computation of  $$\boxed{ S_{12,2} = \sum_{k\geq 1}\frac{H_k H_k^{(2)}}{k^2} }$$ which has an odd weight, hence it is not covered by Thm 4.2 of Flajolet and Salvy. On the other hand they suggest that by the kernel $(\psi(-s)+\gamma)^4$ the previous series and the cubic Euler sum $\sum_{n\geq 1}\frac{H_n^3}{(n+1)^2}=\frac{15}{2}\zeta(5)+\zeta(2)\,\zeta(3)$ are strictly related.

Piezas answered Is there a series to show $22\pi^4>2143\,$? a natural question is Is there a series that proves $\frac{22}{7}-\pi>0$? One such series may be found combining linearly the series that arise from truncating  $$\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{48}{(4k+3)(4k+5)(4k+7)(4k+9)} = \frac{16}{5}-\pi$$ to two and three terms, namely $$\sum_{k=2}^\infty \frac{48}{(4 k+3) (4 k+5) (4 k+7) (4 k+9)} = \frac{141616}{45045}-\pi$$ and $$\sum_{k=3}^\infty \frac{48}{(4 k+3) (4 k+5) (4 k+7) (4 k+9)} = \frac{2406464}{765765}-\pi$$ Solving $$a\left(\frac{141616}{45045}-\pi\right)+b\left(\frac{2406464}{765765}-\pi\right)=\frac{22}{7}-\pi$$ for rational $a,b$ and some algebra manipulation yields the result $$\frac{16}{21} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1008 k^2+6952 k+12625}{(4 k+11) (4 k+13) (4 k+15) (4 k+17) (4 k+19) (4 k+21)}=\frac{22}{7}-\pi$$ It is interesting to note that the coefficients needed to multiply the two component series are both positive $$a=\frac{113}{7·8·9}$$ $$b=\frac{391}{7·8·9}$$ because the truncation points have been chosen so that $$\frac{2406464}{765765}<\frac{22}{7}<\frac{141616}{45045}$$ This procedure yields a result that proves the claim with no need for further processing, and it is readily seen to prove $\frac{p}{q}-\pi>0$ for all fractions between $\pi$ and $\frac{16}{5}$.

Piezas answered Is there a series to show $22\pi^4>2143\,$? a natural question is Is there a series that proves $\frac{22}{7}-\pi>0$? One such series may be found combining linearly the series that arise from truncating  $$\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{48}{(4k+3)(4k+5)(4k+7)(4k+9)} = \frac{16}{5}-\pi$$ to two and three terms, namely $$\sum_{k=2}^\infty \frac{48}{(4 k+3) (4 k+5) (4 k+7) (4 k+9)} = \frac{141616}{45045}-\pi$$ and $$\sum_{k=3}^\infty \frac{48}{(4 k+3) (4 k+5) (4 k+7) (4 k+9)} = \frac{2406464}{765765}-\pi$$ Solving $$a\left(\frac{141616}{45045}-\pi\right)+b\left(\frac{2406464}{765765}-\pi\right)=\frac{22}{7}-\pi$$ for rational $a,b$ and some algebra manipulation yields the result $$\frac{16}{21} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1008 k^2+6952 k+12625}{(4 k+11) (4 k+13) (4 k+15) (4 k+17) (4 k+19) (4 k+21)}=\frac{22}{7}-\pi$$ It is interesting to note that the coefficients needed to multiply the two component series are both positive $$a=\frac{113}{7·8·9}$$ $$b=\frac{391}{7·8·9}$$ because the truncation points have been chosen so that $$\frac{2406464}{765765}<\frac{22}{7}<\frac{141616}{45045}$$ This procedure yields a result that proves the claim with no need for further processing, and it is readily seen to prove $\frac{p}{q}-\pi>0$ for all fractions between $\pi$ and $\frac{16}{5}$.

58,Successive records in mathematical sequences: surprising result,Successive records in mathematical sequences: surprising result,,"I was looking at sequences $x_n=\{n\alpha\}$ with $n=1,2,\cdots$ and $\alpha\in [0, 1]$ an irrational number. Such sequences are known to be equidistributed, so they get arbitrarily close to any number $x\in[0, 1]$ , time and over. The brackets represent the fractional part function. There is a subsequence $t_n$ of indices such that $x_{t_n}$ is the $n$ -th record: it corresponds to the largest value observed sequentially, that is, $t_n$ is the smallest index such that $x_{t_n} > x_{t_{n-1}}$ . Here $x_{t_{n-1}}$ is the previous record. In short, $t_n$ is the arrival time (index) of the $n$ -th record. The sequence $t_n$ is strictly increasing and never ends. For $\alpha = \sqrt{2}/2$ (our focus in this question) we have: I did not expect to see such a pattern. What's more, $$t_{2n+1} = \Big\lfloor \frac{\sqrt{3+2\sqrt{2}}}{2}\Big(3+2\sqrt{2}\Big)^{n}\Big\rfloor,$$ $$t_{2n} = \Big\lfloor \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\Big(3+2\sqrt{2}\Big)^{n}\Big\rfloor.$$ Let us denote as $u_{2n+1}$ and $u_{2n}$ the expression inside the brackets $\lfloor \rfloor$ in the above twin formulas for $t_{2n+1}$ and $t_{2n}$ . We have: $u_n - t_n \rightarrow 0$ (whether $n$ is even or odd) and the convergence is very fast. Anyone interested in proving this result? It is based solely on empirical evidence. A similar result seems achievable for $\sqrt{3}/2$ . Now for non-algebraic number, the kind of periodicity observed here is lost, but we get very intriguing results, with more mysterious patterns. Below is the data for $\alpha = \log_2 3$ : The nice pattern seems to end abruptly beyond the data being displayed here, and indeed the next maximum take places at index 190,537 and 10,781,274. I could not find the next one, maybe due to machine precision or due to a massive gap. I am very interested in some asymptotic value for $t_n$ especially when $\alpha$ is not an algebraic number. I am surprised that the arrival times $t_n$ of the successive records behave so much differently than if the underlying sequence $\{n \alpha\}$ was truly random (I studied the random case here .)

Now look at $\pi$ convergents (skipping the first ones): $22/7$ , $333/106$ , $355/113$ , $103993/33102$ , $104348/33215$ , $208341/66317$ , $312689/99532$ , $833719/265381$ , $11464108/364913$ . The denominators in odd positions corresponds to the successive $\Delta t_n$ . The denominators in even positions corresponds to the successive $t_n$ . This works for all irrationals (need to check) and it gives an alternate way to compute the convergents. For instance, take $t_8=99532$ . Then the fraction $m/99532$ closest to $\pi$ , with $m$ an integer, is a convergent. Using this fact, you can easily obtain $m=312689$ . Background My interest in this problem stems from the following. The sequence $z_n =2^{\{-n \log_2 3\}}$ consists of rational numbers, all having a period (in their binary expansion) equal to $2\cdot 3^{n-1}$ . All have exactly 50% zeros, 50% ones in their binary expansion. The median, which is one of them if $n$ is odd, tends to $\sqrt{2}/2$ . Does it mean that $\sqrt{2}/2$ has 50% zeros too? No, you need to remove ""extreme"" numbers from this sequence. For instance all numbers $z_{t_n}$ with $t_n$ listed in the above table for $\alpha = \log_2 3$ . What other numbers should I remove? I don't know yet, but this is a starting point. It depends on how fast/slowly the ""extreme"" numbers are building up as $n$ increases. See discussion on this topic here , look at the section entitled A different approach . Potential machine learning applications of continued fractions We found a connection between records (maxima) of some sequences, and continued fractions. Doing the same thing with minima will complete this analysis. Extreme events in business or economics settings are typically modeled using statistical distributions (Gumbel and so on), which did not live to their expectations in many instances. The theory outlined here provides an alternative, with each number $\alpha$ serving as a particular model, with its own features distinct from all other numbers. In particular, the numerators and denominators of convergents of $\alpha$ can be used to model the arrival times of extreme events. While the records here are getting closer either to zero or to one, using a logarithm transformation allows you to model phenomena that are not bounded. Note that the sequence $\{n\alpha\}$ has strong, long-range auto-correlations that are well studied (see appendix B in this book ). One could try with the sequence $\{b^n \alpha\}$ instead ( $b > 1$ ) as it exhibits exponentially decaying auto-correlations, also studied in the same book.

Such sequences are known to be equidistributed, so they get arbitrarily close to any number , time and over. The brackets represent the fractional part function. There is a subsequence of indices such that is the -th record: it corresponds to the largest value observed sequentially, that is, is the smallest index such that . Here is the previous record. In short, is the arrival time (index) of the -th record. The sequence is strictly increasing and never ends. For (our focus in this question) we have: I did not expect to see such a pattern. What's more, Let us denote as and the expression inside the brackets in the above twin formulas for and . We have: (whether is even or odd) and the convergence is very fast. Anyone interested in proving this result? It is based solely on empirical evidence. A similar result seems achievable for . Now for non-algebraic number, the kind of periodicity observed here is lost, but we get very intriguing results, with more mysterious patterns. Below is the data for : The nice pattern seems to end abruptly beyond the data being displayed here, and indeed the next maximum take places at index 190,537 and 10,781,274. I could not find the next one, maybe due to machine precision or due to a massive gap. I am very interested in some asymptotic value for especially when is not an algebraic number. I am surprised that the arrival times of the successive records behave so much differently than if the underlying sequence was truly random (I studied the random case here .)

He shows a slide around 44:30 in the video which gives the primes together with these almost primes, which seem to be: 35, 55, 65, 77, 85, 91, 95, 115, 119, 133, 143, 145, 155, 161, 185, 187, 203, 205, ... Now he claims that these are ""the same numbers that appeared in Chen's theorem"", that is, products of two primes, but that doesn't work. For one, many semiprimes are missing from the above list. For another, the primes have relative density 0 in the set of numbers with at most 2 prime factors. So what is this set? I tried to find an explanation in his 2004 paper , but as far as I can tell there is no sequence there, and the relevant portion (Proposition 9.1 if I am not mistaken) is just an existence result on relevant measures, not a concrete measure where at least one could find the numbers which have 'high' weight. I looked it up in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences and found no results. By omitting terms I could find some hits, special subsequences of odd semiprimes, but nothing promising. (I also tried adding in the primes and searching; no luck.) Even the superseeker failed.

Using this definition, I am able to work through the author's example to get the correct generating function: $$G(x)=\frac{1}{1-x-x^2}$$ However, everywhere I read online states the initial conditions of the Fibonacci sequence as (0,1) and not (1,0).

So we get: $$g(x)=a_{-1}+a_{-2}+a_{-1}x$$ Now I'm a bit confused because the subscripts don't seem to match up. In all the author's discussion, the ""initial conditions"" have strictly negative subscripts ( $a_{-i}$ for $i=1,2,\dots,r$ ). But just for the Fibonacci example, we have initial conditions $a_0=0$ and $a_{-1}=1$ . So I assume these are just off by 1.

My calculations: The author starts with a general expression for a generating function for a sequence : He then looks at the special case where is a linear recurrence of range : and proves that this leads to: So, for the Fibonacci sequence, I guess we have and . So we get: Now I'm a bit confused because the subscripts don't seem to match up. In all the author's discussion, the ""initial conditions"" have strictly negative subscripts ( for ). But just for the Fibonacci example, we have initial conditions and . So I assume these are just off by 1.

81,What is the sum of an infinite resistor ladder with geometric progression?,What is the sum of an infinite resistor ladder with geometric progression?,,"I am trying to solve for the equivalent resistance $R_{\infty}$ of an infinite resistor ladder network with geometric progression as in the image below, with the size of the resistors in each section double the size of the previous section. For those not familiar with the calculations for summing resistors, here is a quick recap: There are standard solutions in the literature for infinite resistor ladder networks without geometric progression such as the one below (where $R_x$ is simply R multiplied by a factor of x). The trick here is to replace all of the resistors to the right of the first two with a single resistor of value $R_y$ ... ... and realise that because the network is infinite, the first two resistors make no difference and so $R_{\infty} = R_y$ . The problem becomes finding the combined resistance of the two resistors in parallel $R_x$ and $R_y$ which by the rules of adding resistors is $\frac{R_y R_x}{R_y +R_x}$ and simply adding them to the resistor $R$ that is in series with the rest. We then get the equation: $R_{\infty} = \frac{R_y R_x}{R_y +R_x} + R \rightarrow \frac{R_{\infty} R_x}{R_{\infty} +R_x} + R$ and solve for $R_{\infty}$ using the quadratic solution and the result is: $R_{\infty}= \frac R 2 (1+\sqrt{4x +1} )$ For R=1 and x=1, the result is $(1+\sqrt{5})/2$ which interestingly enough is the golden ratio. For the original problem with the geometric progression, all the rungs are not the same and we can not use the standard trick. Doing it the hard way the first few steps of a small finite geometric ladder are: First rung = 2, First 2 rungs = 9/5 = 1.8, First 3 rungs = 41/23 $\approx 1.78260$ , First 4 rungs = 187/105 $\approx 1.78095$ , First 5 rungs = 853/479 $\approx 1.78079$ , which appears to be converging rapidly toward somewhere around 1.7. It is known by the properties of resistors that the result must be between $1<R_{\infty} <2$ After investigating the pattern for a while it emerges that there is a recursive relationship. If we represent the irreducible fraction for the resistance of each step as A'/B' and the previous step as A/B then the recursive relationship is $$\frac {A'}{B'} = \frac {4A+B}{2A+B}$$ . For example, the first step has a resistance of 2/1. The next step has a total resistance of $\frac{4 * 2 +1}{2 * 2 +1}  = \frac 9 5$ . The result always appears to be an irreducible fraction without requiring a reduction step. This is where I get stuck. It does not seem to be possible to find the limit as n goes to infinity for a recursive formula so I was wondering how to convert the recursive formula to a closed form? P.S. Should I remove the preamble where I recap the formulas for finding the equivalent resistance of resistor circuits? I added it because I assumed the mathematic experts here are not necessarily physics experts. P.P.S.

So I attempted to multipy series, which yielded this: $$f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}x^{2n+1} (-1)^n\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{1}{k+1} { -\frac{1}{2}\choose n-k}{ -\frac{1}{2}\choose k},$$ which I'm unable to simplify further.
