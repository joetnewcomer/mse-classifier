7,Does this extension of the Collatz sequence converge for n=550?,Does this extension of the Collatz sequence converge for n=550?,,"The Collatz function , or $3n + 1$ function is well known. A heuristic argument that most inputs should converge with repeated application of the function is as follows. With probability 1/2 an input $n$ will be either even or odd. If it is even, it will be multiplied by a factor of 1/2. If it is odd, it will be multiplied by a factor of roughly 3, and then divided by 2. So on average we would expect the growth rate per two iterations to be $\frac{1}{2}*\frac{3}{2} = \frac{3}{4} < 1$. Now consider the following extension to numbers $p$ and $q$. $f(n) =  \begin{cases}     n/p       & \quad \text{if } n \text{ is divisible by }p\\     qn \text{ rounded up to the nearest multiple of }p  & \quad \text{if } n \text{ is not divisible by }p\\   \end{cases}$ We can also express this function as (for ease of computation) $f(n) =  \begin{cases}     n/p       & \quad \text{if } n \text{ mod }p=0\\     qn + p - (qn\text{ mod }p)  & \quad \text{otherwise}\\   \end{cases}$ Then, heuristically we can argue that an input $n$ has a $\frac{1}{p}$ probability to be a multiple of $p$ and hence will be multiplied by $\frac{1}{p}$, and a $\frac{p-1}{p}$ probability to be multiplied by a factor of $\frac{q}{p}$. So the average growth factor we expect after $p$ iterations is $\frac{1}{p}(\frac{q}{p})^{p-1}$. Now consider the case $p=3$, $q=5$. The heuristic growth factor is $\frac{1}{3}(\frac{5}{3})^2 = \frac{25}{27} < 1$, so we predict convergence. Indeed, for every starting $n \leq 549$ the sequence formed by repeated application of $f$ converges to one of two cycles. $4 \rightarrow 21 \rightarrow 7 \rightarrow 36 \rightarrow 12 \rightarrow 4$ $8 \rightarrow 42 \rightarrow 14 \rightarrow 72 \rightarrow 24 \rightarrow 8$ However, the sequence starting with $n = 550$ eventually overflows the integer arithmetic in Matlab. (~$10^{200}$). Note that the sequence hovers in the $10^{15}$ range for a while before skyrocketing straight to $10^{200}$, so I don't quite trust the computation.

Edit: writing the analogue of the Cauchy-Riemann conditions for a quaternionic function $P(q)+iQ(q)+jR(q)+kS(q)$ defined for a quaternion $q=(t, x, y, z)$ gives $(\partial_{t}+i\partial_{x}+j\partial_{y}+k\partial_{z})(P+iQ+jR+kS)=0$ hence the ""hyper-Cauchy-Riemann"" matrix is: $M=\begin{pmatrix}    \partial_{t} & -\partial_{x} & -\partial_{y} & -\partial_{z} \\    \partial_{x} & \partial_{t} & -\partial_{z} & \partial_{y} \\    \partial_{y} & \partial_{z} & \partial_{t} & -\partial_{x} \\    \partial_{z} & -\partial_{y} & \partial_{x} & \partial_{t} \\ \end{pmatrix}$ so that $M.\begin{pmatrix}    P \\    Q \\    R \\    S \\  \end{pmatrix}=0$. Multiplying on the left by the transpose of $^{4}\nabla=\begin{pmatrix}    \partial_{t} \\    \partial_{x} \\    \partial_{y} \\    \partial_{z} \\ \end{pmatrix}$ and then the transpose of the resulting matrix on the left by $\begin{pmatrix}    -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\    0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\    0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\    0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ \end{pmatrix}$ gives $\partial_{t}^{2}=\nabla^{2}$ and $\partial_{x}+\partial_{y}+\partial_{z}=0$, hence the wave equation and the continuity equation. The fact that multiplying the matrix $M$ on the left by $\begin{pmatrix}    -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\    0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\    0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\    0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ \end{pmatrix}$ (that is, the application of the ""metrick"") yields the same matrix with the opposite signs of the coefficients of the first row shows that any hyperholomorphic function defined on an euclidean 4-manifold remains hyperholomorphic when defined on the correspondent lorentzian 4-manifold. This is thus an invariant property when one passes from the purely mathematical realm to the physical one. The key idea is to show that this holds true for the vertical distribution of the Riemann zeros, those ones having to be the mathematical equivalent (i.e on the euclidean side) of the energy levels of an atom (on the lorentzian side).",,"['number-theory', 'soft-question', 'mathematical-physics', 'riemann-zeta', 'quaternions']"

When is it possible to find infinitely many translates ${n + {\mathcal H} =(n+h_1,\ldots,n+h_{k_0})}$ of ${{\mathcal H}}$ which consists entirely of primes?"" To study this, the concept of an admissible set is introduced: a $k_0$-tuple ${\mathcal H}$ is admissible ""if it avoids at least one residue class ${\hbox{ mod } p}$ for each prime ${p}$."" It is pointed out that, since for non-admissible sets ${\mathcal H}$ there exists a prime $p$ such that ${\mathcal H}$ meets every residue class $\hbox{ mod } p$, then every translate of ${\mathcal H}$ must contain a multiple of $p$, and so there can only be a finite number of translates of ${\mathcal H}$ consisting entirely of primes: in particular, each translate consisting of only primes must contain $p$ itself. This seems incredibly restrictive. Given a non-admissible $k_0$-tuple ${\mathcal H}$, just how many translates are there consisting only of primes, and how does this depend on $k_0$? Can there even be more than 1? As an example, the non-admissible $3$-tuple $(0,2,4)$ has only a single translate consisting of primes -- $(3,5,7)$ -- since every third odd number greater than 3 is divisible by 3, and hence not prime. There are plenty of prime triplets, i.e. $3$-tuples of the form $(p, p+2, p+6)$ or $(p,p+4,p+6)$, but both $(0,2,6)$ and $(0,4,6)$ are admissible -- and similarly for prime quadruplets, quintuplets, and sextuplets.

It is pretty obvious that $d(n) \ge 2$ for any given number $n \ge 2$ , since every number is divisible by $1$ and itself. $2$ is also the best lower bound since there is an infinite amount of prime numbers. One can also quite easily see that $d(2n)d(2n+1) \ge 8$ for any number $n \ge 3$ since $2n$ is divisible by $1$ , $2$ , $n$ and $2n$ , so $d(2n) \ge 4$ , while $d(2n+1) \ge 2$ . To my knowledge, it is not known whether that bound is optimal or not. To generalize that result, let $s(m)$ denote the optimal bound for $\displaystyle\prod_{k=0}^{m-1} d(mn+k)$ for $n$ big enough, meaning $$s(m)=\liminf_{n \to \infty} \prod_{k=0}^{m-1} d(mn+k)$$ I'm now interested in the growth rate of $s(m)$ , especially whether or not $\displaystyle \max_m(s(m)^\frac1m) = \infty$ It is clear that $s(m) \ge 2^m$ , so it grows at least exponentially. Are there any better lower bounds? Edit: Does it make a difference whether one starts at $mn+0$ and ends at $mn+m-1$ , or multiplies over any arithmetic progression of length $m$ for big enough $n$ ?

We are asked to establish the result using primitive roots. We know that for any primitive root $g_1$ of $p$, $g=g_1+kp$ is, for some $k$, a primitive root mod $p^h$. Also, if $x$ is a solution of the congruence, then there is some $r$ such that $x \equiv g^r \mod p^h$. The congruence then becomes $$(g^r)^p\equiv1\mod p^h,$$ from which we can infer $\phi(p^h)∣rp$. This especially means $p^{h−2}(p−1)∣r$. All in all, we know now that $r$ has to be even and only take values $p^{h−2}(p−1)\leq r\leq p^{h−1}(p−1)$. I've played around with a few numbers a bit, and found that $r$ likely has to be of the form $kp^{h−2}(p−1)$ for $1\leq k\leq p$, which means that there are exactly $p$ distinct solutions to the congruence, as was expected (by asking WolframAlpha to solve the original congruence). These solutions are given by $$x=g^{kp^{h-2}(p-1)}.$$ We can check this and it looks like it fits. But I really don't know how to show that the number of solutions is $p$.

Any hints would be greatly appreciated","So the problem is to determine the number of solutions of the congruence $x^p\equiv 1\mod p^h$, where $p$ is an odd prime and $h\geq2$. We are asked to establish the result using primitive roots. We know that for any primitive root $g_1$ of $p$, $g=g_1+kp$ is, for some $k$, a primitive root mod $p^h$. Also, if $x$ is a solution of the congruence, then there is some $r$ such that $x \equiv g^r \mod p^h$. The congruence then becomes $$(g^r)^p\equiv1\mod p^h,$$ from which we can infer $\phi(p^h)∣rp$. This especially means $p^{h−2}(p−1)∣r$. All in all, we know now that $r$ has to be even and only take values $p^{h−2}(p−1)\leq r\leq p^{h−1}(p−1)$. I've played around with a few numbers a bit, and found that $r$ likely has to be of the form $kp^{h−2}(p−1)$ for $1\leq k\leq p$, which means that there are exactly $p$ distinct solutions to the congruence, as was expected (by asking WolframAlpha to solve the original congruence). These solutions are given by $$x=g^{kp^{h-2}(p-1)}.$$ We can check this and it looks like it fits. But I really don't know how to show that the number of solutions is $p$. Why does $r$ have to be of that specific form? That's only a thing I observed but am not able to prove. Any hints would be greatly appreciated",,"['number-theory', 'primitive-roots']"
