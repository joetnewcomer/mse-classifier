My question is whether or not such a group exists, and if it does, is there any simple way to describe these groups based on knowing how the Sylow structure is built?

20,What is the name of this group-like structure?,What is the name of this group-like structure?,,"I noticed this group-like structure popping up all over place. Below is a realization of the structure in first order rational functions. The structure has only six elements ( Edit: it's tempting to think it's some group like $S_3$ , but I will later note that crucially, the three sets of elements I describe below each have a distinct additive operation only defined on that subset, and there are 4 operations in total, but the structure is still closed, and has identities and inverses). Define $x_1$ and $x_2$ to be complementary fractions (real numbers between 0 and 1 such that $x_1+x_2=1$ ). Define $y_1$ and $y_2$ to be the ratios between the complementary fractions, i.e. $y_1=\frac{x_1}{x_2}$ , $y_2=\frac{x_2}{x_1}$ . Define $n_1$ and $n_2$ to be the multiplicative inverses of $x_1$ and $x_2$ respectively. I'll include a diagram of operations between the elements later in the post, but I first want to show examples of where this structure pops up, to show why I'm motivated to understand it. An example of this structure in probability theory is if $x_1$ and $x_2$ are probabilities of complementary events. Then $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the expected numbers of tries one needs to perform to get 1 success on the associated events. Then $y_1$ and $y_2$ are the odds (e.g. 7:1 or 19:20, if one wants to use the limited colon notation for odds). A second example of where this occurs is if we let $x_1=\sin^2 x$ , $x_2=\cos^2 x$ , $n_1=\csc^2 x$ , $n_2=\sec^2 x$ , $y_1=\tan^2 x$ , and $y_2=\cot^2 x$ . A third example is in circuit theory. If we have two elements sharing a branch or a node, then voltage or current division follows this algebra/group-thing. If you're an electrical engineer, you might also see glimpses of this structure when dealing with BJT transistors. The parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are in fact $x_1$ and $y_1$ which is why $\beta=\frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha}$ and $\alpha=\frac{\beta}{\beta+1}$ . The reason why this structure is fascinating to me is that every element can be transformed into another element by the use of a simple first-order rational function, but of a specific form. For example $n_1=\frac{n_2}{n_2-1}$ (and this specific transformation is special in that it is an involution, along with the more obvious $1-x$ and $1/x$ in the structure). Various other interesting functions like $\frac{x}{x+1}$ , $\frac{x}{1-x}$ and their one-complements and multiplicative inverses (which also simlplify to (1,0), (0,1), or (1,1) rational functions of same form, where the criteria for sameness is left vague by me, but I hope you can see the general form and which rational functions satisfy this form) can be studied in this structure and reveal cool patterns. Here is a picture of how the structure looks like under all allowed operations: Important Edit: PLEASE look at the diagram carefully. This does not seem associative in a way that a group would be! Note that there are in total 4 operations, 1-, -1, +1, and 1/. Not all operations can be used on all elements. The three additive-flavor operations for example are only defined on the x's, n's, or y's respectively. However, the 1/ operation is universal in the structure. The elements neatly sort themselves into two groups of three and three groups of two based on these allowed operations. Finally, I want to mention that the rational functions participating in transformations between the elements can be extended to all rational functions with unity coefficients, of order 1 in 2 variables $a,b$ by defining $x_1=\frac{a}{a+b}$ and $x_2=\frac{b}{a+b}$ . I don't have a proof of this, this argument follows from intuition and might not be precisely correct. But this all just intrigues me so much. This is in fact the starting point from which I discovered this structure; I'm an electrical engineering student and I noticed that voltage division for example has $x_1=\frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2}$ , and if one allows for negative resistance (as in active devices), you might have something like $\frac{R_a}{R_a-R_b}$ which falls into this extended structure too. You can even further extend this structure by defining a dual set of these once-extended rational functions over additional variables 1/a and 1/b. This fits nicely into the electrical engineering picture because it actually gives a ton of intuitive insight on some relationships between resistances, conductances, and their series and parallel configurations! For example, the equivalence $\frac{R_1}{R_1+(R_2+R_3)}=\frac{G_2\|G_3}{G_1 + G_2 \| G_3}$ (where $R_i=\frac{1}{G_i}$ , and $A\|B=\frac{AB}{A+B}$ ) can be established more intuitively in this way, if one studies the structure deeply. Note that the sum of resistances is the inverse of the parallel configuration of conductances, i.e. $\frac{1}{R_1+R_2}=G_1\|G_2=\left(\frac{1}{R_2}\right)\|\left(\frac{1}{R_2}\right)$ .

Let us assume $g$ is constructed by foreign cycles marked $c_i$ for $1 \le i \le m$ for some $m \in \mathbb N$ . Then we have $g = c_1 ... c_m$ . We know $|g| = {\rm lcm}(c_i)$ and since $|g| = 2$ we have $\phi(g)$ is a product of 2-cycles. Notice $|g|=2 \implies g \neq e$ and therefore for all $g^{'} \in G$ we have $gg^{'} \neq g$ meaning $\phi(g)$ doesn't ""leave"" any object in it's place. Therefore we have $\phi(g)$ is a product of exactly $2n+1$ 2-cycles and this implies $\phi(g) \notin A_{4n+2}$ and therefore $N \lt A_{4n+2}$ . Now notice, for all $n \in \mathbb N$ exists some $p>2$ primal (and obviously odd) such that we have some $e \neq g \in H$ such that $|g| = p$ . In this case we have $\phi(g)$ is a product of oddsized-cycles and therefore $\phi(g) \in A_{4n+2}$ and therefore $N$ isn't trivial. This implies $N \lhd H$ a proper subgroup. Now this is the part I'm not sure I'm allowed to deduce Since we know $G \cong H$ we have some $H^{'} \lt G$ such that $H^{'} \cong N$ therefore meaning $H^{'} \lhd G$ a proper subgroup, thus implying $G$ isn't simple.

Yet other books such as ""Applications of Group Theory in Quantum Mechanics"" by Petrashen and Trifonov, published in 2009 on page 49 use a regular "" $\times$ "". Due to this I'm very confused which notation to use. On to the question itself, using the definition from my notes: DEFINITION $1.2.$ A direct product of two groups $H$ and $K$ , denoted as $H \otimes K$ , is deﬁned as the set of all distinct ordered pairs $(h, k)$ , where $h$ is an element of $H$ and $k$ is an element of $K$ , with the binary composition law $$(h_1,k_1)(h_2,k_2) \equiv (h_1h_2,k_1k_2),$$ determined by the composition rules within $H$ and $K$ . This direct product, also known as the external product , satisﬁes the group axioms. Applying the procedure outlined above to the 2 groups I find that, $$D_{3h}=D_3\otimes C_s =\left(E, C_3, {C_3}^2, \sigma_{v,1}, \sigma_{v,2}, \sigma_{v,3}\right)\left(E, \sigma_h\right)$$ $$=\left(E, C_3, {C_3}^2, \sigma_{v,1}, \sigma_{v,2}, \sigma_{v,3}, \sigma_h, C_3\sigma_h,{C_3}^2\sigma_h,\sigma_{v,1}\sigma_h,\sigma_{v,2}\sigma_h,\sigma_{v,3}\sigma_h\right)\tag{1}$$ The problem with this equation is that I don't know what the elements of $D_{3h}$ are, so I followed the prescription laid out by my notes but how does this prove that $D_{3h}=D_3 \otimes C_s$ ? Here is the author's solution: The group $D_3$ of the top and bottom faces has elements $$D_3=\{E, C_3, {C_3}^2, \sigma_{v,1}, \sigma_{v,2}, \sigma_{v,3}\}$$ The prism has an additional symmetry operation, a horizontal reflection plane $\sigma_h$ , resulting from the equivalence of the top and bottom faces. The associated group is $C_s = \{E, \sigma_h\}$ . Since $\sigma_h$ operates on vertical coordinates, and the elements of $D_3$ operate on horizontal coordinates, the elements of $C_s$ and $D_3$ commute. Hence, the group of the prism, which is denoted as $D_{3h}$ , is $$D_{3h}=D_3 \otimes C_s.$$ Again, this solution doesn't really seem to 'prove' that $D_{3h}=D_3 \otimes C_s$ , to me the author has just given a handwaving argument and I'm left confused.

If $\phi: G \to H$ is a group homomorphism then $\phi(e) = e$ . Furthermore for all $g \in G$ and $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ we have $\phi(g)^n = \phi(g^n)$ By the proposition we know that $$\phi([1])^k = \phi([1]^k)$$ where $[1]^k = [1] + [1] + \cdots + [1] = [(k)( 1)] = [k]$ . This means that the mapping of any element $[r] \in \mathbb{Z}_n$ by the automorphism $\phi$ , $\phi([r])$ , is determined by iterating the map of $[1]$ under $\phi$ $r$ -times. Hence any automorphism $\phi \in Aut(\mathbb{Z}_n)$ is determined by $\phi([1])$ . For the next part, showing that $\phi([1])$ is a generator of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ I always seem to struggle with showing that an element is a generator of a cyclic group.

Therefore, if $\phi([1])^k = [0]$ for $k \lt n$ then by applying the inverse map $\phi^{-1}$ (whose existence is guaranteed by the fact that $\phi$ is an automorphism). We find: $$[1]^k = [0]$$ Now, first, is this the correct proof that $\phi([1])$ is a generator for $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and second, I'm having trouble seeing why this proves $\phi([1])$ is a generator. Is it because we see that given the proposition and the assumptions our algebra leads us to the fact that $[1]^k = [0]$ where we know that $[1]$ is a generator for the (additive) group $\mathbb{Z}_n$ ?

Describe all groups $G$ that contain no proper subgroups. Here is my attempt. If $G = \{e\}$ , then it is clear $G$ has no proper subgroups, so suppose that $G \neq \{e\}$ . Let $x \in G$ be a non-identity element, and consider $\langle x \rangle$ , the cyclic group generated by $x$ . Certainly $\langle x \rangle \leq G$ , but if $G$ has no proper subgroup and $\langle x \rangle \neq \{e\}$ since $x \neq e$ , we have $G = \langle x \rangle$ . So $G$ must be cyclic. We prove that $G$ must be finite. Suppose $G$ were infinite. Then $\langle x \rangle \cong \mathbb{Z}$ by the map $\varphi: \mathbb{Z} \to \langle x \rangle$ sending $n \longmapsto x^n$ . But $2\mathbb{Z}$ is a non-proper subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}$ , and the image of a subgroup under a homomorphism is a subgroup of the codomain. In particular, $2\mathbb{Z}$ is the cyclic subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}$ generated by $2$ , so $\varphi(2\mathbb{Z})$ is the cyclic subgroup of $G$ generated by $x^2$ . But $x \not \in \langle x^2 \rangle$ , so $\langle x^2 \rangle \neq G$ . Furthermore, it is not the identity since $x$ has infinite order. So we have found a proper subgroup of $G$ , a contradiction, so $G$ has finite order. Finally, we prove that $G$ must have prime order. Suppose the order of $G$ is not prime, i.e., $|G| = ab$ for $a,b > 1$ . Let $G = \langle x \rangle$ , so $|x| = |\langle x \rangle| = ab$ . Then $\left(x^a\right)^b = e$ , so $\langle x^a \rangle$ is a cyclic subgroup of $G$ of order $b$ ; since $a,b > 1$ , this is a proper subgroup, so we have a contradiction. Hence, $|G| = p$ , where $p$ is prime. Finally, we must show that all prime cyclic groups contain no proper subgroups. If $G$ is a cyclic group of prime order $p$ , then any subgroup $H \leq G$ must have order dividing the order of $G$ by Lagrange's theorem.

I know that $S_3$ is isomorphic to $\operatorname{Aut}(G)$ , but I don't know off-hand whether this bijection is the correct one. I referenced a similar answer here Proving that ${\rm Aut}(S_3)$ is isomorphic to $S_3$ , but it doesn't give an explicit formula for the bijection, and though I understand that $S_3$ is generated by its transpositions and so any automorphism is determined completely by how it acts on $(12)$ , $(13)$ , and $(23)$ , I don't understand how a bijection follows. Updated Attempt: I claim that $\phi: S_3 \to \mathrm{Aut}(S_3)$ sending $g \longmapsto c_g (x) = gxg^{-1}$ is an isomorphism. In general, $\phi: G \to \mathrm{Aut}(G)$ sending $g \longmapsto c_g$ is a homomorphism, so it suffices to show that $\phi$ is a bijection. We have: \begin{align*} g \in \mathrm{ker}(\phi) & \iff \phi(g) = c_g (x) = x, \; \forall x \in G \\ & \iff gxg^{-1} = x, \; \forall x \in G \\ & \iff gx = xg, \; \forall x \in G \\ & \iff g \in Z(G) = \{e\}, \end{align*} so the kernel of $\phi$ is trivial, so $\phi$ is injective. I claim that $\phi$ is also surjective. We have $S_3 = \langle a = (12), b = (13), c = (23) \rangle$ , each of which has order $2$ , so given $g \in S_3$ , we have $g = a^i b^j c^k$ for $i,j,k \in \{0,1,2\}$ . Since an automorphism $f \in Aut(S_3)$ must preserve the order of elements, $f$ must send transpositions to transpositions. Furthermore, upon fixing where $f$ send these transpositions, the rest of the map is determined. Since there are $3!$ possibilities for where to send the permutations, there are exactly $6$ automorphisms, so $|S_3| = |\mathrm{Aut}(S_3)|$ .

73,Which automorphism groups are well-understood?,Which automorphism groups are well-understood?,,"Obviously the automorphism groups of finite dimensional vector spaces are studied in great detail.

He says under example 1.1.9 that: Let $p$ be a prime. Consider the non-zero residues modulo $p$ , which we denote by $(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^{\times}$ . Then $((\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^{\times},\times)$ is a group. It then asks under question 1.1.10: Why do we need the fact that $p$ is prime? which, to my understanding, is an exercise to the reader. Since the binary operation is multiplication, I am pretty sure we are talking about modular multiplication, which looks like: The above is modular multiplication modulo 10. What I am getting confused about however is the group $(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^{\times}$ . In the book, it is defined as the non-zero residues modulo $p$ , i.e.: $$(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^{\times}=(1,2,3,...,n-1)$$ However, on Wikipedia, the multiplicative group of integers modulo $n$ is the set of numbers from $(1,2,3,...,n-1)$ coprime to $n$ . Assuming it is the book's definition, my proof would be: If $n$ is a positive integer not prime, then there exist 2 numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $a\times{b}=n$ . However, since neither $n$ or 0 is found in the set $(1,2,3,...,n-1)$ , then closure of the binary operation, multiplication, is not achieved. Furthermore, since the identity is 1, then there doesn't exist an inverse for all numbers since there is at least one factor of n in $(1,2,3,...,n-1)$ , which we will denote $d$ , as $d\times{k}\mod(n)\neq{1}$ for any positive integer $k$ . $(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^{\times},\times)$ is therefore not a group. Instead, choose a positive integer $p$ . Then closure is achieved since two numbers $a$ and $b$ can never multiply to $p$ as that would violate the statement that $p$ is prime. I am unable to continue the proof from here since I am unsure how to prove an inverse in $(1,2,3,...,p-1)$ exists for all integers in $(1,2,3,...,p-1)$ . It is obvious that the identity is 1 and there exists associativity since the operation is multiplication though for both cases. To summarise, when answering could you please: Clarify the concrete meaning of $(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^{\times}$ by writing out the set. Check that the binary operation within this group is, in fact, modular multiplication. Check whether the first bit of my proof is valid and give hints to finishing the proof or provide an alternative proof (though my knowledge in abstract algebra is a bit limited considering I just started learning it). I apologise if I have a silly misconception or one that is quite trivial, though I have started looking at cyclic groups and the book has not yet introduced me to quotient groups.
