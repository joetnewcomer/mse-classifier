Without pausing to explain, he had then given us another problem: evaluate $\dfrac{\sin(x)}{x}$ at $x=0$. $$$$ Would somebody please explain what Limits truly are? Why do we need to take Limits?

How can we actually evaluate a function at a point where it does not exist (for example: how is $\dfrac{1}{0}=\infty$?)? $$$$ I woul be truly grateful if somebody could please help clear these doubts I face.

The problem is to prove that the function given by $y = 0, x \leq 0$ and $y = e^{-1/x}, x > 0$  is $C^\infty$ smooth. When x is less than 0, there's no problem as obviously the function is infinitely differentiable.  Similarly, when x is greater than zero the function is infinitely differentiable, by the properties of the exponential function.  As I see it, the difficulty arises in what happens right at 0.  For the function to be differentiable there, the function needs to be continuous at 0, and for that to happen both the right hand and left hand limits need to equal 0.  So for the function to be infinitely differentiable, one would need to show that in the limit the function $e^{-1/x}$, and all its derivatives, go to zero as x goes to 0. Am I on the right track?

EDIT: Thank you to @ClaudeLeibovici for showing that this result is incorrect. I think the closeness of the values ( $\frac{e}{\pi}$ ) might just be a mere coincidence.

What is the average value of the quotient $\frac{x}{y}$ ? Can you argue on elementary grounds that the answer must exceed 1? My answer: If $x$ has been picked, then the average of the quotient is $$ \int_1^2 \frac{x}{y}\,dy = x\ln(2) $$ Averaging over possible values of $x$ yields $$ \int_1^2 x\ln(2)\, dx = \frac{3}{2}\ln(2) \approx 1.03 $$ But this is not an argument based on elementary grounds I don't think. Interpreting the average value of a function over an interval as being the height of the rectangle with base on the interval and with the same area as the area under the function over the interval leads me to the following argument. The average value of $x$ is $3/2$ . The quotient $x/y$ then ranges from $3/4$ to $3/2$ . We can underestimate the area under this curve by splitting it up into a rectangle with length $1$ and height $3/4$ and a right triangle on top of the rectangle whose hypotenuse is the tangent line to the curve $\frac{3}{2y}$ at the point $(3/2,1)$ . This gives a triangle with height $7/12$ and base $7/8$ . So an underestimate for the area under the curve would be $\left(1\cdot \frac{3}{4}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{7}{8}\cdot \frac{7}{12}\right) = \frac{193}{192}$ . Here is an illustration of my quotient function with $x = 3/2$ , the tangent line, and the rectangle: Since the base of the rectangle with the same area on $[1,2]$ has length $1$ its height must be at least $\frac{193}{192}$ to match the area under the graph.  Hence, the height, or average value, exceeds $1$ . Question: Does this seem to be an argument the author could be looking for instead of integrating? This is a single variable calculus text.  The section is ''The Average Value of a Function"". Note that not until the next chapter is probability introduced. Update: I have obtained a copy of the author's own solutions manual. Here is the official solution: To argue on elementary grounds that the answer must exceed 1, note that the outcomes $a/b$ and $b/a$ must occur equally often, so that the answer is certainly greater than the minimum over all $a$ and $b$ in $[1,2]$ of the average of these two numbers. Now this average is $$ \frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{a}\right] = \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2ab} $$ and this is always greater than 1 because $a^2 + b^2 - 2ab = (a-b)^2 > 0$ .","Textbook problem: Two numbers, first and then , are chosen at random between and .

91,Find the Vector Equation of a line perpendicular to the plane.,Find the Vector Equation of a line perpendicular to the plane.,,"Question: Find the vector equation $r(t)$ for the line through the point $P = (-1, -5, 2)$ that is perpendicular to the plane $1 x  - 5 y + 1 z = 1$. Use $t$ as your variable, $t = 0$ should correspond to $P$, and the velocity vector of the line should be the same as the standard normal vector of the plane. This one is really giving me a hard time.  I know that to find the plane perpendicular to the line I can use the vector n between two points on the line and and the plane.  I cannot wrap my mind around how to reverse this process, particularly because the plane is equal to 1 and not zero.
