Let $(M,g)$ be an analytic Riemannian manifold, and $U\subset M$ an open set with compact closure. Define the Sobolev space $H^k(U)$ as usual. Is $C^\omega(\bar U)$ dense in $H^k(U)$? I think a proof could make use of Whitney's $C^k$-norm analytic approximation theorem (Hirsch, p. 66, or maybe the stronger Grauert-Remmert approximation theorem), but I'm not sure how to proceed without partitions of unity. Namely, if $\bar U$ is contained in a chart with compact closure, one should dominate the Sobolev norm by the $C^k$ norm: $$||f||_{H^k}\le C\sup_{0\le p\le k}|D^p f|,$$ where $C$ depends on $\dim M$, and bounds of Christoffel symbols, curvature tensors, and derivatives of curvatures (hence it is important that $U$ is precompact). Whitney's theorem then gives $C^\omega\subset C^k$ being dense in $H^k$-norm, which gives density in $H^k$. I don't understand Hirsch's proof of Whitney's analytic atlas theorem, which might be useful? I'm looking an idea of how to proceed.

Let $(M,g)$ be an analytic Riemannian manifold, and $U\subset M$ an open set with compact closure. Define the Sobolev space $H^k(U)$ as usual. Is $C^\omega(\bar U)$ dense in $H^k(U)$? I think a proof could make use of Whitney's $C^k$-norm analytic approximation theorem (Hirsch, p. 66, or maybe the stronger Grauert-Remmert approximation theorem), but I'm not sure how to proceed without partitions of unity. Namely, if $\bar U$ is contained in a chart with compact closure, one should dominate the Sobolev norm by the $C^k$ norm: $$||f||_{H^k}\le C\sup_{0\le p\le k}|D^p f|,$$ where $C$ depends on $\dim M$, and bounds of Christoffel symbols, curvature tensors, and derivatives of curvatures (hence it is important that $U$ is precompact). Whitney's theorem then gives $C^\omega\subset C^k$ being dense in $H^k$-norm, which gives density in $H^k$.

This is true by inspection. $\fbox{Induction Step:}$ Assume $P(k)$ for some $k \geq 1$. $\fbox{Proof of $P(k + 1) :$}$ Since $\{H_1, H_2, ... , H_n\}$ is a set of $n$ horses, the induction hypothesis applies to this set. Thus, all the horses in this set are the same color. Since $\{H_2, H_3, ... , H_{n+1}\}$ is also a set of $n$ horses, the induction step likewise holds for this set. Thus, all the horses in this set are the same color too. Therefore, all $n +1$ horses in $\{H_1, H_2, H_3, ... , H_n , H_{n+1}\}$ are the same color. QED. The issue the instructor was trying to point out is clearly valid. For the case $n = 1$, there is only ${H_1}$.

But it was proposed in the class discussion that this was the only problem. Had you been able to prove $P(2)$ true, then a proof of the above format would have been fine. My interpretation is that yes, you could prove all horses are the same color, if you can prove that any set of two horses will be the same color. But this format would not work. Why not? The problem I see is that the above proof is for the existence of at least one particular pair of sets of horses of sizes $n$ and $n + 1$, such that in each set, all horses are the same color.  Particularly when the set of size $n$ is a subset of the set of size $n + 1$.

42,Why is this combination of nearest-integer functions --- surprisingly --- continuous?,Why is this combination of nearest-integer functions --- surprisingly --- continuous?,,"Alright, I didn't know the best way to formulate my question. Basically, whilst doing some physics research, I naturally came upon the function $$ f(x) = 2x[x] - [x]^2 $$ where I use $[x]$ as notation for the `nearest-integer function' (i.e. rounding off). Usually this function has to have a caveat of how we exactly define the value for $x \in \frac{1}{2} \mathbb Z$, but interestingly for this function it does not matter, since it turns out to be continuous! In fact, it turns out $f(x)$ is exactly given by the glued function of taking all the tangent lines of $x^2$ at integer values of $x$: (Note: due to properties of $x^2$, the tangent lines exactly intersect at half-integer values of $x$.) So my question is not literally `why is it continuous?', but rather: considering it is continuous, and considering that that is not a generic property of functions which are defined in terms of nearest-integer functions, is there a better (i.e. more insightful) way of expressing $f(x)$?

56,A constrained topological sort?,A constrained topological sort?,,"Suppose that one has a directed, acyclic graph G, and each vertex $v$ contains a (positive) value $a_v$.  Additionally, let $r$ be a constant.  For my purposes, $r>1$, but this might not matter.  Let $n$ be the number of vertices in G and let $[n]:=\{1,2,\ldots, n\}$. A topological sort of $G$ is a bijection $G\to[n]$ such that if there is a path from $v$ to $w$, then $\tau(v)<\tau(w)$.  Alternately, if we view $G$ as defining a partial ordering, a topological sort is a total ordering extending the partial ordering. I would like to find $\displaystyle\min_{\tau} \sum_v a_v r^{\tau (v)}$, where we are taking the minimum over all topological sorts of G.  It may help to generalize the problem and to finding $\displaystyle\min_{\tau} \sum_v a_v p({\tau (v)})$, where $p:[n]\to \mathbb R$ is a penalty/weight function (perhaps assumed to take positive values and be monotonic). There are two extreme cases.  If $G$ has no edges, we would sort things in ascending or descending order depending on if $r<1$ or $r>1$.  If $G$ is already a linear order, there is nothing to be done.  Already, the problem seems nontrivial given two disjoint linear orderings, where the problem reduces to the optimal riffle shuffle. So is there a good algorithm for solving this?  I know of some heuristics which help in certain cases, and I can use a bubble-sort type algorithm to get ""local"" minima, but unless there is a way to recast the problem, I don't see a good way to solve it. Added later: I want to extend my comment and explain why I view dynamic programming to be insufficient.  At best, this will clarify what I'm looking for.  At worst, this will reveal a gap in my understanding which someone can clarify. For there to be a dynamic programming solution, there need to be sub-problems which can be built upon to get a larger solution.  For example, when searching for a path through a graph with edge lengths, if a minimal length path passes through a particular vertex, then the path from from the start to that vertex must be of minimal length.  If we keep track of all the vertices that can be reached in time less than $t$, then we can ignore all paths through those close vertices which do not begin with a minimal path, and so we need to remember at most one path to any vertex, and at every stage we only need to find the shortest path to an unvisited vertex which is an extension of a known minimal path.  This gives $O(n^2)$ storage costs and $O(nm)$ time costs where $n$ is the number of vertices and $m$ is the number of edges. The obvious sub-problem to use for the problem at hand is that, if we know an initial/terminal segment for an optimal solution, the restriction to the subgraph containing just those elements will yield the same initial/terminal segment.  It does not appear that we can say anything stronger.  The algorithm this yields is as follows: Select all vertices with no predecessors, and put each of these singletons into a list of admissible initial segments. (Definition) For an admissible initial segment of length $n$, we say that an extension of length $n+1$ is admissible if it satisfies both the topological constraints of the directed graph and, if no topologically allowed insertion of the new element has a lower total value.  From the collection of all admissible extensions of length $n+1$. Given the collection of all admissible segments of length $n$, form the collection of all admissible extensions of length $n+1$. From the collection generated in (3), if any two admissible extensions use exactly the same collection of vertices, remove the segment with a higher associated cost. Loop through (3) and (4) until you have found the minimal initial segment containing every vertex of the graph. If the penalty function is monotonic increasing (e.g., if $r>1$), we can improve run time somewhat by adding a heuristic (total cost of adding everything else at the minimum possible distance, ignoring that only one item can be in any particular spot), but even with this improvement, we have the following fundamental problem: The algorithm doesn't require checking every initial segment, but it does require examining every collection of vertices which could form an allowable initial segment.  In the worst case scenario, this is exponential in the number of vertices (though is significantly reduced when there are severe topological constraints).  Additionally, in the worst case scenario, the space requirements are on the order of $\binom{n}{n/2}$ where there are $n$ vertices. The dynamic programming algorithm is still quite an improvement over more naive algorithms, but I would like to find something that runs in polynomial time, or else show that such an algorithm cannot exist.","Suppose that one has a directed, acyclic graph G, and each vertex $v$ contains a (positive) value $a_v$.

What I don't understand is why The relation $R_2$ defined by $R_2 = \{(1, 1), (3, 3), (2, 1), (3, 2)\}$ is not a reflexive relation on $A$, since $(2, 2) \notin R_2$. is not a Reflexive Relation Could someone give me an example of what a simple reflexive relation is, and isn't? Thanks all for the input, see below for a good example of a Reflexive Relation Here's what the book describes both as: Identity relation. Let $A$ be any set. Then the relation $R = \{(x, x) : x \in A\}$ on $A$ is called the identity relation on $A$. Thus, in an identity relation, every element is related to itself only. For example, consider $A = \{a, b, c\}$ and define relations $R_1$ and $R_2$ as follows.   $R_1 = \{(a, a) ,(b, b), (c, c)\}$ $R_2 = \{(a, a), (b, b), (c, c), (a, c)\}$ Then $R_1$ is an identity relation on $A$, but $R_2$ is not an identity relation on $A$ as the element $a$ is related to $a$ and $c$. Reflexive relation. A relation $R$ on a set $A$ is said to be a reflexive relation if every element of $A$ is related to itself. Thus, $R$ is reflexive iff $(x, x) \in R$ for all $x \in A$.   A relation $R$ on a set $A$ is not reflexive if there is an element $x \in A$ such that $(x, x) \notin R$.   For example, consider $A = (1, 2, 3)$.

Remark Every identity relation on a non-empty set $A$ is a reflexive relation, but not conversely. Consider $A = \{a, b, c\}$ and define a relation $R$ by $R = \{(a, a), (b, b), (c, c), (a, b)\}$.

So I will try to rephrase it. Look at your favorite hyperbolic grid .  This question asks for a labeling system for the points. Of course we could draw the grid on the Poincare disk, and use real numbers (the (x,y) coordinates of each point), but in practice that would raise all sorts of precision issues that could surely be avoided if one had a proper symbolic coordinate system.  You shouldn't need real numbers if you're staying on grid points! Just like (2,3)+(0,1) is trivial to do by hand (or in your head) for the square grid, we'd like some form of symbolic coordinates ( i.e. consisting of finite sequences of symbols) for a hyperbolic grid, in which simple operations on small grid vectors are similarly easy. If you take some sequence of left and right turns in a hyperbolic grid city, what should you keep track of in your head so you can take the optimal route back to your starting point?

Original Question If we consider the Euclidean plane, then a square grid works well with using two integers (the coordinates) as a representation for vectors that lie on the grid. Does anybody know of a similarly nice representation for working in the hyperbolic plane? Desirable features of any such system: $-$ It should be easy to add two vectors. $-$ It should be easy to see if two vectors are the same. $-$ It should be easy to see if two vectors are close. $-$ It should be easy to rotate a vector by an angle that is a symmetry of the grid. $-$ Every point in the plane should be near some vector. (The grid shouldn't have large empty regions.) Note that ""addition"" using continuous coordinates would most naturally be defined in terms of parallel transport, and it is neither commutative nor associative.  On a grid, however, the issue of orientation needs to be addressed differently, since parallel transport along arbitrary grid vectors will introduce rotations that are not a symmetry of the grid, so to remain on the grid, addition will need to be defined using something other than parallel transport.

Addendum: Many readers seem to be disturbed by a little voice saying ""But vectors don't make sense in the hyperbolic plane!"": What that voice is really saying is that the hyperbolic plane doesn't give you all the nice properties you are used to in Euclidean space or in vector spaces.  So if you define vectors as objects having specific properties you are used to (such as having a direction that is unaffected by parallel transport), then that definition may not correspond to anything in the hyperbolic world.

Expressing the expression as an infinite product: and then using some sort underlying inequalities might help! Please suggest.
