(Works 100% of the time,70% of the time) and got: $$1=\sin(x)^4+3\sin(x)\cos(x)^3$$ Which I could not solve, although if anybody CAN solve it I would love to hear how. So I input the original equation into a computer algebra system and it told me that it is an equivalent problem to the solution of this equation: $$2\sec(x)^2=3\tan(x)+1$$ Now this was solvable with the same approach that failed on the original equation. I just converted it into a quartic polynomial problem at the end, after rewriting it in terms of sin and cos. But a number of questions arose, the answers to which would greatly help my ability to solve trig equations, but for the purpose of this site I think i'll split them up into multiple posts each with a very precise focus, so that they will be more useful to other users. Question: How do I know if a given trigonometric equation can be simplified? (of course im primarily concerned about non obvious cases) and by simplified I think the example I gave is a good one for what I mean by simplified. Two things happened: (1) The number of terms in the equation that contained trigonometric functions was reduced. it went from 3 in the original to only 2 in the computer algebra system's output (2) The order (natural power) of any trig terms in the equations was reduced. How do I know if it is possible to accomplish one or both of these goals, given a purely trigonometric equation?

18,Angle of rotation between two points on cylindrical helix,Angle of rotation between two points on cylindrical helix,,"Schematic drawing of the problem I would like to calculate the angle of rotation $\theta$ between two points $A$ and $B$ , positioned on the termini of a helix wrapping around a cylinder of known diameter $2r$ and length $L$ in a counter-clockwise manner. The angle $\alpha$ , i.e. the acute angle between the vertical axis of the cylinder and the slope of the helix, is the only other parameter known. How would you calculate the angle $\theta$ ? Please see the attached image. The coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are not known; any point (here $B$ ) at the top of the cylinder rotates with angle $\theta$ respective to a point (here $A$ ) at the bottom. My goal is to find the resulting $\theta$ only knowing $L$ , $r$ , and $\alpha$ . Note that $\theta$ can be larger than $360^\circ$ if the helix has more than one revolution on the cylinder. As an example, consider the following values: $\begin{align}\qquad \alpha &= 0.3^\circ \\ L &= 1.5 \\ r &= 0.2 \end{align}$ I tried to get an answer by using basic trigonometry, but I'm missing the helical aspect of the rotation I think. To calculate $\theta$ , I assumed that it was basically the angle of an isoceles triangle with two sides $r$ and one side $\tan(\alpha) \cdot L$ (because the chord between $A$ and the projection of $B$ is the opposite side of a right-angled triangle denoted by $\tan(\alpha) \cdot L$ ). Since the resulting triangle is not right-angled, I split it in two and calculated half $\theta$ with $$\sin(\frac{\theta}{2}) = \frac{1}{2}\tan(\alpha)\cdot\frac{L}{r}$$ such that $\frac{\theta}{2} = \sin^{-1}(\frac{1}{2}\tan(\alpha)\cdot\frac{L}{r})$ and therefore $$\theta = 2\cdot\sin^{-1}\left(\tan(\alpha)\cdot\frac{L}{2r}\right)$$ Solving this equation for my example yields $2\cdot \sin^{-1}(\tan(0.3)\frac{1.5}{2\cdot 0.2}) = 2.25^\circ$ , which seems feasible. However, my equation breaks down when $\theta$ is greater than $180^\circ$ — because there is no triangle anymore — and it certainly cannot deal with more than one revolution ( $>360^\circ$ ). I have trouble finding the right equations to deal with this problem. By chance, I stumbled upon an equation for helix torsion $$w = \frac{k}{r \cdot (1+k^2)}$$ on https://www.redcrab-software.com/en/Calculator/Helix , in which $w$ is the torsion, $k$ is the helix slope, and $r$ is the radius. It gives similar results to my own equation at small values of $\alpha$ when I multiply the answer by $L$ and use radians instead of degrees, before converting back to degrees: $\frac{0.3\cdot\frac{\pi}{180}}{0.2\cdot(1+(0.3\cdot\frac{\pi}{180})^2)}\cdot1.5\cdot\frac{180}{\pi} = 2.25^\circ$ . It also seems to be able to deal with $\theta > 180^\circ$ . I do not understand how it works, however, nor how it was derived. Is this even the right equation?
