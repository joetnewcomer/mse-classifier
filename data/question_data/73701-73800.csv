Definition. An $n$- cell is a topological space homeomorphic to the open ball $B^n$. A cell is a space which is an $n$-cell for some $n$. Definition. Let $X$ be a topological space. A cell decomposition of $X$ is a collection $\mc E=\set{e_\alpha}_{\alpha\in J}$ of disjoint subspaces $e_\alpha$ of $X$ such that each $e_\alpha$ is a cell and $X=\bigcup_{\alpha\in J}e_\alpha$. Definition. Let $X$ be a topological space and $\mc E$ be a cell decomposition of $X$. The $n$- skeleton of $X$  is defined as the union of all the cells in $\mc E$ of dimension $n$ or lower. The $n$-skeleton of $X$ is written as $X^n$. Definition. Let $X$ be a topological space and $\mc E$ be a cell decomposition of $X$. Let $e$ be an $n$-cell in $\mc E$. We say that a map $\Phi:D^n\to X$ is a characteristic map corresponding to $e$ if i) $\Phi$ maps $B^n$ homeomorphically onto $e$, and ii) $\Phi(S^{n-1})\subseteq X^{n-1}$. Definition. Let $X$ be a Hausdorff topological space and $\mc E$ be a cell decomposition of $X$. We say that $\mc E$ is a CW-complex structure on $X$ if the following axioms are satisfied: (CM) Each $e\in \mc E$ admits a characteristic map. (CF) For each cell $e\in \mc E$, the closure of $e$ intersects only a finite number of cells in $\mc E$. (WT) A subset $A$  of $X$ is closed in $X$ if and only if $A\cap \bar e$ is closed in $X$ for each $e\in \mc E$. Theorem 1. Let $X$ be a Hausdorff space and $\mc E$ be a cell decomposition of $X$ satisfying the (CM) axiom. Then for each $n$-cell $e\in \mc E$, we have $\bar e=\Phi_e(D^n)$, where $\Phi_e$ is any characteristic map corresponding to $e$. Proof. For any continuous map $f:A\to B$ between topological space $A$ and $B$, we have $f(\bar S)\subseteq \overline{f(S)}$ for all subspaces $S$ of $A$. Using this, we get $\Phi_e(D^n)\subseteq \bar e$. On the other hand, since $D^n$ is compact, we have $\Phi_e(D^n)$ is a compact subspace of $X$. Since $X$ is Hausdorff, $\Phi_e(D^n)$ is closed in $X$. But since $e\subseteq \Phi_e(D^n)$, we must have $\bar e\subseteq \Phi_e(D^n)$. So we conclude that $\bar e=\Phi_e(D^n)$. Theorem 2. (Topology of CW Complexes.) Let $X$ be a Hausdorff topological space and $\mc E$ be a cell decomposition on $X$ satisfying the (CM) and the (WT) axiom. Let $\mc F$ be the set of characteristic maps, one for each cell in $\mc E$. Then the topology on $X$ is final with respect to $\mc F$. Proof. Write $\mc F=\set{\Phi_\alpha: D_\alpha\to X}_{\alpha\in J}$, where each $D_\alpha$ is a closed unit ball in some Euclidean space and each $\Phi_\alpha:D_\alpha\to X$ is a characteristic map corresponding to some cell in $\mc E$, while insisting that $\mc F$ has exactly one characteristic map for any given cell in $\mc E$. Let $F$ be a subspace of $X$. We have $$ \begin{array}{rcl} F \text{ is closed in } X & \stackrel{(1)}{\iff} & F\cap \im(\Phi_\alpha) \text{ is closed in } X \text{ for all } \alpha\in J\\ & \stackrel{(2)}{\iff} & F\cap \im(\Phi_\alpha) \text{ is closed in } \im(\Phi_\alpha) \text{ for all } \alpha\in J\\ &\stackrel{(3)}{\iff} & \Phi_\alpha^{-1}(F\cap \im(\Phi_\alpha))\text{ is closed in } D_\alpha \text{ for each } \alpha\in J\\ &\stackrel{(4)}{\iff} & \Phi_\alpha^{-1}(F)\cap D_\alpha \text{ is closed in } D_\alpha \text{ for each } \alpha\in J\\ &\stackrel{(5)}{\iff} & \Phi_\alpha^{-1}(F) \text{ is closed in } D_\alpha \text{ for all } \alpha\in J \end{array} $$     Since $\mc E$ satisfies the (CM) axiom, (1) is justified by Theorem 1 and the (WT) axiom. To see (2), we note that if $F\cap \im(\Phi_\alpha)$ is closed in $X$, then $F\cap \im(\Phi_\alpha)$ is closed in $\im(\Phi_\alpha)$ too, for $\im(\Phi_\alpha)$ is a compact and hence closed subspace of $X$. The other direction is similar. To get $(3)$, note that if $\Phi_\alpha^{-1}(F\cap \im(\Phi_\alpha))$ is closed in $D_\alpha$, then it is in fact a compact subspace of $D_\alpha$ because closed subspaces of compact spaces are compact. Therefore, the image of $\Phi_\alpha^{-1}(F\cap \im(\Phi_\alpha))$ under $\Phi_\alpha$, which is nothing but $F\cap \im(\Phi_\alpha)$, is a compact and therefore closed subspace of $\im(\Phi_\alpha)$. The steps (4) and (5) are obvious. The Main Confusion. Let $(X, \mc E)$ be a CW-complex structure on a Hausdorff space $X$.   We want to express $X^n$ as a space formed by attaching $n$-discs to $X^{n-1}$. For each $e\in \mc E_n$, let $\Phi_e:D^n_e\to X^n$ be a characteristic map for $e$. By the co-product property of the disjoint union, we get a map $\Phi:\disun_{e\in \mc E_n}D^n_e\to X^n$. We write $Z=\disun_{e\in \mc E_n}D^n_e$. Again, the maps $\Phi:Z\to X^n$ and the inclusion map $i:X^{n-1}\hookrightarrow X^n$ give a map $f:Z\disun X^{n-1}\to X^n$. For each $e\in \mc E_n$, write $\vp_e$ to denote $\Phi_e|_{S^{n-1}_e}$, that is, $\vp_e$is the restriction of $\Phi_e$ to the boundary of $D^n_e$. Then we have a map $\vp:\disun_{e\in \mc E_n} \partial D^n_e\to X^{n-1}$ again obtained by the co-product property of disjoint union. Now the map $f$ factors bijectively through the space $Z\disun_{\vp}X^{n-1}$ giving a bijective map $\alpha:Z\disun_{\vp}X^{n-1}\to X^n$. We will show that the map $\alpha$ is a homeomorphism. We know that the topology on $X^{n}$ is final with respect to the maps $\Phi:Z\to X^n$ and the inclusion map $i:X^{n-1}\hookrightarrow X^n$. Thus $\alpha^{-1}$ is continuous if and only if both $\alpha^{-1}\circ i$ and $\alpha^{-1}\circ \Phi$ are continuous. But this is evident from the commutative diagram and therefore $\alpha $is a homeomorphism. Confusion. The above working shows that no matter what were the choices of the characteristic maps $\Phi_e$ for $n$-cells in $X$, we get that $X^n$ is homeomorphic to $Z\disun_{\vp}X^{n-1}$.   This is perplexing because two different characteristic maps for an $n$-cell may attach the boundary of the $n$-disc in different ways to $X^n$. But still we end up getting the same space (up to homeomorphism).   I do not ""directly see"" why this should be so. Can somebody shed some light on this? That said, I am not entirely sure I my working is correct. I have not see this in any book. I just recetnly read the definition of a CW complex and thought a bit about the definition, ending up with this question. Hope somebody can settle this.

52,Weaker notion of first-countability for filters?,Weaker notion of first-countability for filters?,,"While trying to understand the motivation behind the definition of a filter I've stumbled upon the following notion, let's call it ""almost first-countability"": Let $x$ be a point of a set $X$ and $\mathcal{F}$ be a filter on $X$ such that each $F\in\mathcal{F}$ contains $x$. We say $\mathcal{F}$ is almost first-countable if there is a countable collection $\mathcal{C}=\{C_1,C_2,\dots\}$ of nested subsets of $X$ (so $C_1\supset C_2\supset\cdots$) such that $\Sigma(\mathcal{C})=\Sigma(\mathcal{F})$, where for any $\mathcal{X}\in P(P(X))$ the symbol $\Sigma(\mathcal{X})$ denotes the set of sequences $\phi\colon\mathbb{N}\to X$ converging with respect to the collection $\mathcal{X}$, i.e. each element of $\mathcal{X}$ contains a tail of $\phi$. Clearly if $\mathcal{F}$ is first-countable, i.e. it can be generated by a countable filter base, then it is almost first-countable (just take $\mathcal{C}$ to be $\{C_1,C_1\cap C_2,C_1\cap C_2\cap C_3,\dots\}$ where $\{C_1,C_2,C_3,\dots\}$ is a countable filter base generating $\mathcal{F}$). Question: Is this notion strictly weaker than first-countability? In other words, are there a set $X$, a non-first-countable filter $\mathcal{F}$ at $x\in X$ and a countable collection $\mathcal{C}=\{C_1,C_2,\dots\}$ of nested subsets of $X$ such that $\Sigma(\mathcal{C})=\Sigma(\mathcal{F})$? Observation: Call $\mathcal{C}'$ the filter generated by the base $\mathcal{C}$ by adding all supersets of elements of $\mathcal{C}$. Then $\Sigma(\mathcal{C}')=\Sigma(\mathcal{C})$. It follows that the above question boils down to finding two filters at $x$ sharing the same set of convergent sequences and such that one is first-countable while the other is not (or proving they do not exist, of course). As an exercise for myself let me rewrite user126154's brilliant argument in a more detailed fashion. In order to fix the ideas, instead of letting $\alpha$ be any non-$\omega$-cofinal limit ordinal I decided to choose a concrete example by picking up the smallest limit ordinal which is not $\omega$-cofinal. If I'm not mistaken this should be the first uncountable ordinal $\omega_1$. Consider the first uncountable ordinal $\omega_1$ and the filter $\mathcal{F}_\infty$ on $\omega_1$ generated by the filter base $\mathcal{B}_\infty:=\{(a,\infty)\mid a\in \omega_1\}$ where $(a,\infty):=\{x\in \omega_1\mid x>a\}$. Observe that $\Sigma(\mathcal{F}_\infty)$ is empty: indeed, assume there is a sequence $\phi\colon\mathbb{N}\to \omega_1$ converging with respect to $\mathcal{F}_\infty$; by induction $\phi$ has a strictly increasing subsequence $\phi'$ also converging w.r.t. $\mathcal{F}_\infty$; the limit of this sequence is just $s:=\sup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\{\phi'(n)\mid n\in\mathbb{N}\}$, i.e. a countable union of countable ordinals which is still countable, hence $s\in \omega_1$  and the interval $(s+1,\infty)$ does not contain any tail of $\phi'$, which is absurd. Further observe that $\mathcal{F}_\infty$ cannot be generated by a countable filter base, otherwise we could construct a sequence converging w.r.t. the base and hence also w.r.t. $\mathcal{F}$. Now consider the set $X:=(\sqcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}} (\omega_1)_n)\cup\{\infty\}$ consisting of the disjoint union of countably many copies of $\omega_1$ together with a new point $\infty$, and construct the filter $\mathcal{F}$ on $X$ consisting of all subsets $F\subset X$ satisfying all the three conditions below: $F\cap(\omega_1)_n\in\mathcal{F}_\infty$ for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$, there is $j\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $F\cap(\omega_1)_k=\omega_1$ for each $k\geq j$, $\infty\in F$. Notice that $\mathcal{F}$ cannot be generated by a countable filter base, otherwise by restricting each element of the base to one copy of $\omega_1$ we would obtain a countable filter base for $\mathcal{F}_\infty$. Now consider the collection $\mathcal{C}=\{C_n\mid n\in\mathbb{N}\}$ of subsets of $X$ where $C_n$ is defined by the next three conditions: $C_n\cap(\omega_1)_j=\emptyset$ for $j<n$, $C_n\cap(\omega_1)_j=\omega_1$ for each $j\geq n$, $\infty\in C_n$ for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$. Clearly $\mathcal{C}$ satisfies the axioms of a filter base, and the filter that it generates is obviously first-countable. Now we show that $\Sigma(\mathcal{F})=\Sigma(\mathcal{C})$. Let $x_n$ be a sequence in $X$ converging w.r.t. $\mathcal{C}$. Each $F\in\mathcal{F}$ contains some $C_n$ so $x_n$ converges w.r.t. $\mathcal{F}$ as well. Conversely, assume $x_n$ converges w.r.t. $\mathcal{F}$ and define $\sigma(n)$ to be the index of the copy of $\omega_1$ where $x_n$ lies (put $\sigma(n)=\star$ if $x_n=\infty$). If for each $n$ there is $j_n$ such that for each $k\geq j_n$ $\sigma(k)$ is either greater than $n$ or equal to $\star$ then $x_n$ obviously converges w.r.t. $\mathcal{C}$ and we are done. Otherwise $\sigma$ has a constant subsequence at some natural number, that is there is a subsequence $x_{n_k}$ staying in a single copy of $\omega_1$. Since $x_n$ converges w.r.t. $\mathcal{F}$ by assumption, then $x_{n_k}$ must converge w.r.t. $\mathcal{F}_\infty$ and this is impossible since $\Sigma(\mathcal{F}_\infty)=\emptyset$. Conclusion: we have found a set $X$, two filters at some point $x\in X$ one of which is first-countable while the other is not (the former being the filter generated by $\mathcal{C}$, the latter being $\mathcal{F}$) sharing the same set of converging sequences in $X$. In other words, $\mathcal{F}$ is ""almost first-countable"" but not first-countable, therefore the notion spelled out above of ""almost first-countability"" is really different than first-countability (in particular, it is strictly weaker). In order to avoid ambiguities I add the definitions used. A filter on $X$ is a nonvoid collection of subsets of $X$ such that: the empty set does not belong to the collection, any finite intersection of its elements is a superset of some element of the collection, any superset of any of its elements belongs to the collection. A filter base is like a filter but we drop the third assumption. By adding all supersets of all elements of a filter base $\mathcal{F}$ we obtain the filter $\mathcal{F}'$ generated by the base $\mathcal{F}$. It follows that a nonvoid collection $\mathcal{B}\in P(P(X))$ is a base of a given filter $\mathcal{F}$ if and only if $\mathcal{B}\subset\mathcal{F}$ and each $F\in\mathcal{F}$ contains some $B\in\mathcal{B}$.","While trying to understand the motivation behind the definition of a filter I've stumbled upon the following notion, let's call it ""almost first-countability"": Let $x$ be a point of a set $X$ and $\mathcal{F}$ be a filter on $X$ such that each $F\in\mathcal{F}$ contains $x$. We say $\mathcal{F}$ is almost first-countable if there is a countable collection $\mathcal{C}=\{C_1,C_2,\dots\}$ of nested subsets of $X$ (so $C_1\supset C_2\supset\cdots$) such that $\Sigma(\mathcal{C})=\Sigma(\mathcal{F})$, where for any $\mathcal{X}\in P(P(X))$ the symbol $\Sigma(\mathcal{X})$ denotes the set of sequences $\phi\colon\mathbb{N}\to X$ converging with respect to the collection $\mathcal{X}$, i.e. each element of $\mathcal{X}$ contains a tail of $\phi$. Clearly if $\mathcal{F}$ is first-countable, i.e. it can be generated by a countable filter base, then it is almost first-countable (just take $\mathcal{C}$ to be $\{C_1,C_1\cap C_2,C_1\cap C_2\cap C_3,\dots\}$ where $\{C_1,C_2,C_3,\dots\}$ is a countable filter base generating $\mathcal{F}$). Question: Is this notion strictly weaker than first-countability? In other words, are there a set $X$, a non-first-countable filter $\mathcal{F}$ at $x\in X$ and a countable collection $\mathcal{C}=\{C_1,C_2,\dots\}$ of nested subsets of $X$ such that $\Sigma(\mathcal{C})=\Sigma(\mathcal{F})$? Observation: Call $\mathcal{C}'$ the filter generated by the base $\mathcal{C}$ by adding all supersets of elements of $\mathcal{C}$. Then $\Sigma(\mathcal{C}')=\Sigma(\mathcal{C})$. It follows that the above question boils down to finding two filters at $x$ sharing the same set of convergent sequences and such that one is first-countable while the other is not (or proving they do not exist, of course). As an exercise for myself let me rewrite user126154's brilliant argument in a more detailed fashion. In order to fix the ideas, instead of letting $\alpha$ be any non-$\omega$-cofinal limit ordinal I decided to choose a concrete example by picking up the smallest limit ordinal which is not $\omega$-cofinal. If I'm not mistaken this should be the first uncountable ordinal $\omega_1$. Consider the first uncountable ordinal $\omega_1$ and the filter $\mathcal{F}_\infty$ on $\omega_1$ generated by the filter base $\mathcal{B}_\infty:=\{(a,\infty)\mid a\in \omega_1\}$ where $(a,\infty):=\{x\in \omega_1\mid x>a\}$. Observe that $\Sigma(\mathcal{F}_\infty)$ is empty: indeed, assume there is a sequence $\phi\colon\mathbb{N}\to \omega_1$ converging with respect to $\mathcal{F}_\infty$; by induction $\phi$ has a strictly increasing subsequence $\phi'$ also converging w.r.t. $\mathcal{F}_\infty$; the limit of this sequence is just $s:=\sup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\{\phi'(n)\mid n\in\mathbb{N}\}$, i.e. a countable union of countable ordinals which is still countable, hence $s\in \omega_1$  and the interval $(s+1,\infty)$ does not contain any tail of $\phi'$, which is absurd. Further observe that $\mathcal{F}_\infty$ cannot be generated by a countable filter base, otherwise we could construct a sequence converging w.r.t. the base and hence also w.r.t. $\mathcal{F}$. Now consider the set $X:=(\sqcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}} (\omega_1)_n)\cup\{\infty\}$ consisting of the disjoint union of countably many copies of $\omega_1$ together with a new point $\infty$, and construct the filter $\mathcal{F}$ on $X$ consisting of all subsets $F\subset X$ satisfying all the three conditions below: $F\cap(\omega_1)_n\in\mathcal{F}_\infty$ for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$, there is $j\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $F\cap(\omega_1)_k=\omega_1$ for each $k\geq j$, $\infty\in F$. Notice that $\mathcal{F}$ cannot be generated by a countable filter base, otherwise by restricting each element of the base to one copy of $\omega_1$ we would obtain a countable filter base for $\mathcal{F}_\infty$. Now consider the collection $\mathcal{C}=\{C_n\mid n\in\mathbb{N}\}$ of subsets of $X$ where $C_n$ is defined by the next three conditions: $C_n\cap(\omega_1)_j=\emptyset$ for $j<n$, $C_n\cap(\omega_1)_j=\omega_1$ for each $j\geq n$, $\infty\in C_n$ for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$. Clearly $\mathcal{C}$ satisfies the axioms of a filter base, and the filter that it generates is obviously first-countable. Now we show that $\Sigma(\mathcal{F})=\Sigma(\mathcal{C})$. Let $x_n$ be a sequence in $X$ converging w.r.t. $\mathcal{C}$. Each $F\in\mathcal{F}$ contains some $C_n$ so $x_n$ converges w.r.t. $\mathcal{F}$ as well. Conversely, assume $x_n$ converges w.r.t. $\mathcal{F}$ and define $\sigma(n)$ to be the index of the copy of $\omega_1$ where $x_n$ lies (put $\sigma(n)=\star$ if $x_n=\infty$). If for each $n$ there is $j_n$ such that for each $k\geq j_n$ $\sigma(k)$ is either greater than $n$ or equal to $\star$ then $x_n$ obviously converges w.r.t. $\mathcal{C}$ and we are done. Otherwise $\sigma$ has a constant subsequence at some natural number, that is there is a subsequence $x_{n_k}$ staying in a single copy of $\omega_1$. Since $x_n$ converges w.r.t. $\mathcal{F}$ by assumption, then $x_{n_k}$ must converge w.r.t. $\mathcal{F}_\infty$ and this is impossible since $\Sigma(\mathcal{F}_\infty)=\emptyset$. Conclusion: we have found a set $X$, two filters at some point $x\in X$ one of which is first-countable while the other is not (the former being the filter generated by $\mathcal{C}$, the latter being $\mathcal{F}$) sharing the same set of converging sequences in $X$.

We mean here $L_2$, and $L_1$ the usual Lebesgue spaces on the unit-interval. It is excercise 2.4 from Rudin. There's several ways to show that $L_2$ is nowhere dense in $L_1$. But in (b) they ask to show that $$\Lambda_n(f)=\int fg_n \to 0 $$ where $g_n = n$ on $[0,n^{-3}]$ and 0 otherwise, holds for $L_2$ but not for all $L_1$. Apparantly this implies that $L_2$ is of the first Category, but I dont know how.  Second, I can show this holds for $L_2$ but I cant find a counterexample in $L_1$. Theorem 2.7 in Rudin says: Let $\Lambda_n:X\to Y$ a sequence of continuous linear mappings ($X,Y$ topological vector spaces) If $C$ is the set of all $x\in X$ for which $\{\Lambda_n x\}$ is Cauchy in $Y$, and if $C$ is of the second Category, then $C=X$. So if we find a $f\in L_1$ such that $\Lambda_n(f)$ is not Cauchy, then we proved that $L_2\subset C \subset L_1$ is of the first category. However I dont see why showing that $\Lambda_n(f)$ does not converge to 0 for some $f\in L_1$ is enough here.

I've further been able to show that the latter fails if there is an infinite, Dedekind-finite set--if $X$ is such a set, topologize $X$ discretely, which is the same as topologizing $X$ as the disjoint union of an infinite, Dedekind-finite family of singleton spaces, each of which is sequentially compact, and since sequences of points of $X$ will necessarily have only finitely-many distinct points by Dedekind-finiteness, we have that $X$ is also sequentially compact. I'd like to be able to weaken the second result to the following Claim : If the disjoint union of a family of topological spaces is sequentially compact, then the family is Dedekind-finite, and each member of the family is sequentially compact. Ideally, I'd like to do it in a setting without Countable Choice, but I just don't see a way out of it.

However, while Dedekind-finiteness of the family is sufficient to ensure that this doesn't happen, I cannot see why it should be necessary. If the family is Dedekind-infinite, then we have a countably-infinite subfamily, but without a choice function, I see no way to choose a single point from each member of the subfamily to make a sequence without convergent subsequence.

Is there a topology on the set $\mathscr T_X$ such that $\circ:\mathscr T_X\times \mathscr T_X\longrightarrow \mathscr T_X$ is a continuous function with respect to the product topology on $\mathscr T_X\times \mathscr T_X?$ (i.e., is there a topology on $\mathscr T_X$ making it a topological semigroup?) Clearly, two (one if $X$ is a one-element set) topologies always work: the discrete and the indiscrete topology on $\mathscr T_X$ make the composition continuous as any function into an indiscrete space is continuous and any function from a discrete space is. (And the product of two discrete spaces is discrete.) I will call those two topologies trivial. These topologies don't seem useful at all, so I will re-write the question. Let $\operatorname{card}(X)>1.$ Is there a non-trivial topology on $\mathscr T_X$ making it a topological semigroup? (or at least, is there a construction of such a topology depending on $\operatorname{card}(X)$ which yields non-trivial topologies at least in some cases?) I cannot think of any general approach to this question and I think I may not have the tools -- I know virtually nothing about topological semigroups. I would be grateful for any help, be it in the form of a hint, a reference, or a full or partial answer to the question. Also, please don't hesitate to comment on anything even remotely related to this. Re Tara B's answer I may be mistaken but I think your example works only for finite sets. In general, I think, when we have a semigroup $S$ and a non-empty proper subset $A\subset S,$ then $\{\emptyset, A,S\}$ forms a good topology iff the following two conditions are satisfied: $(1)$ $A$ is a subsemigroup of $S;$ $(2)$ $S\setminus A$ is an ideal in $S.$ Let's say that in this situation, we call $A$ saturated and $S\setminus A$ prime. (I'm not sure if this is standard nomenclature, but I can imagine it might be.) Suppose a non-empty proper subset $A\subset \mathscr T_X$ is saturated. Then there is $\phi\cdot\operatorname{id}=\phi\in A$ and so $\operatorname{id}\in A.$ Let $\psi\in S_X.$ Then $\psi\psi^{-1}=\operatorname{id}\in A,$ and so $\psi\in A.$ Therefore $S_X\subseteq A.$ But also, let $\mathscr T_X\ni\chi\mathscr J\operatorname{id}.$ Then for some $\alpha,\beta\in\mathscr T_X,$ we have $\alpha\chi\beta=\operatorname{id}.$ Hence $\alpha\chi\in A,$ and so $\chi\in A.$ Therefore the $\mathscr J$-class $J_{\operatorname{id}}$ is contained in $A.$ But for an infinite set $X,$ we have the proper containment $S_X\subsetneq J_{\operatorname{id}},$ because there are functions from $X$ to $X$ whose rank is equal to $\operatorname{card}(X)$ but which aren't permutations. So $S_X$ cannot be saturated. I think for an infinite set $X$ there will be no such $A$ at all. I'm unable to prove this but I think we can obtain any function in $\mathscr T_X$ by composing functions in $J_{\operatorname{id}}.$ If that's true, then if $A$ were saturated, then it would be a subsemigroup containing a set generating the whole $\mathscr T_X$ and so $A=\mathscr T_X.$ $S_X$ clearly works for finite sets $X$ though. It's a subsemigroup of $\mathscr T_X$ and its complement is an ideal because the composition of functions of which at least one doesn't have the maximal rank cannot have the maximal rank either. And for finite $X,$ a function $\phi: X\longrightarrow X$ is a permutation iff it has the maximal rank. I believe $S_X$ is the only saturated subsemigroup of $\mathscr T_X$ for $X$ finite. EDIT The statement ""when we have a semigroup $S$ and a non-empty proper subset $A\subset S,$ then $\{\emptyset, A,S\}$ forms a good topology iff the following two conditions are satisfied: $(1)$ $A$ is a subsemigroup of $S;$ $(2)$ $S\setminus A$ is an ideal in $S.$"" is false. When a semigroup isn't a monoid it may not be true. For example, Let $\mathbb N=\{1,2,\ldots\}$ be the additive semigroup of natural numbers. Let $A=\{1\}.$ Then $\{\emptyset,A,\mathbb N\}$ is a good topology on $\mathbb N,$ because the inverse image of $A$ under addition is empty. This is impossible in a monoid. It is also impossible in a monoid for the inverse image of $A$ to be equal $S\times S$ because the image of $S\times S$ under the semigroup operation is equal to $S.$ I have to think about it some more.","$\mathscr T_X$ will denote the set of all functions from a non-empty set $X$ into itself, with the binary operation of composition $\circ$ making it a semigroup, called the full transformation semigroup on $X$. Is there a topology on the set $\mathscr T_X$ such that $\circ:\mathscr T_X\times \mathscr T_X\longrightarrow \mathscr T_X$ is a continuous function with respect to the product topology on $\mathscr T_X\times \mathscr T_X?$ (i.e., is there a topology on $\mathscr T_X$ making it a topological semigroup?) Clearly, two (one if $X$ is a one-element set) topologies always work: the discrete and the indiscrete topology on $\mathscr T_X$ make the composition continuous as any function into an indiscrete space is continuous and any function from a discrete space is. (And the product of two discrete spaces is discrete.) I will call those two topologies trivial. These topologies don't seem useful at all, so I will re-write the question. Let $\operatorname{card}(X)>1.$ Is there a non-trivial topology on $\mathscr T_X$ making it a topological semigroup? (or at least, is there a construction of such a topology depending on $\operatorname{card}(X)$ which yields non-trivial topologies at least in some cases?) I cannot think of any general approach to this question and I think I may not have the tools -- I know virtually nothing about topological semigroups. I would be grateful for any help, be it in the form of a hint, a reference, or a full or partial answer to the question. Also, please don't hesitate to comment on anything even remotely related to this. Re Tara B's answer I may be mistaken but I think your example works only for finite sets. In general, I think, when we have a semigroup $S$ and a non-empty proper subset $A\subset S,$ then $\{\emptyset, A,S\}$ forms a good topology iff the following two conditions are satisfied: $(1)$ $A$ is a subsemigroup of $S;$ $(2)$ $S\setminus A$ is an ideal in $S.$ Let's say that in this situation, we call $A$ saturated and $S\setminus A$ prime. (I'm not sure if this is standard nomenclature, but I can imagine it might be.) Suppose a non-empty proper subset $A\subset \mathscr T_X$ is saturated. Then there is $\phi\cdot\operatorname{id}=\phi\in A$ and so $\operatorname{id}\in A.$ Let $\psi\in S_X.$ Then $\psi\psi^{-1}=\operatorname{id}\in A,$ and so $\psi\in A.$ Therefore $S_X\subseteq A.$ But also, let $\mathscr T_X\ni\chi\mathscr J\operatorname{id}.$ Then for some $\alpha,\beta\in\mathscr T_X,$ we have $\alpha\chi\beta=\operatorname{id}.$ Hence $\alpha\chi\in A,$ and so $\chi\in A.$ Therefore the $\mathscr J$-class $J_{\operatorname{id}}$ is contained in $A.$ But for an infinite set $X,$ we have the proper containment $S_X\subsetneq J_{\operatorname{id}},$ because there are functions from $X$ to $X$ whose rank is equal to $\operatorname{card}(X)$ but which aren't permutations. So $S_X$ cannot be saturated. I think for an infinite set $X$ there will be no such $A$ at all. I'm unable to prove this but I think we can obtain any function in $\mathscr T_X$ by composing functions in $J_{\operatorname{id}}.$ If that's true, then if $A$ were saturated, then it would be a subsemigroup containing a set generating the whole $\mathscr T_X$ and so $A=\mathscr T_X.$ $S_X$ clearly works for finite sets $X$ though. It's a subsemigroup of $\mathscr T_X$ and its complement is an ideal because the composition of functions of which at least one doesn't have the maximal rank cannot have the maximal rank either. And for finite $X,$ a function $\phi: X\longrightarrow X$ is a permutation iff it has the maximal rank. I believe $S_X$ is the only saturated subsemigroup of $\mathscr T_X$ for $X$ finite. EDIT The statement ""when we have a semigroup $S$ and a non-empty proper subset $A\subset S,$ then $\{\emptyset, A,S\}$ forms a good topology iff the following two conditions are satisfied: $(1)$ $A$ is a subsemigroup of $S;$ $(2)$ $S\setminus A$ is an ideal in $S.$"" is false. When a semigroup isn't a monoid it may not be true. For example, Let $\mathbb N=\{1,2,\ldots\}$ be the additive semigroup of natural numbers. Let $A=\{1\}.$ Then $\{\emptyset,A,\mathbb N\}$ is a good topology on $\mathbb N,$ because the inverse image of $A$ under addition is empty. This is impossible in a monoid. It is also impossible in a monoid for the inverse image of $A$ to be equal $S\times S$ because the image of $S\times S$ under the semigroup operation is equal to $S.$ I have to think about it some more.",,['general-topology']
