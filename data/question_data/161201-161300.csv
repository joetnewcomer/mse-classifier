Suppose I have a compact metric space $X$, with $([0,1], B, \mu)$ a probability space, with $B$ a (Borel) sigma algebra, and $\mu$ the probability measure. Suppose also that $\mu(A) > 0$ for any nonempty set $A \subset X$. If we take a measure invariant transformation $T:X\to X$ and assume it is NOT topologically mixing, how do we show it CANNOT be mixing with respect to $\mu$? This is how I would attempt it.  Take two sets nonempty open sets $A$ and $B$ in $X$. Since we know that T is NOT topologically mixing, there are infinitely many natural numbers $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $T^{n}(A) \cap B = \emptyset$. The preimage of $T^{n}(A)$ is $T^{n-1}(A)$. By measure preservation, we have $\mu (T^{n-1}(A)) = \mu(T^{n}(A))$. By repeated argument, we eventually have $\mu (T^{-n}(A)) = \mu(A)$. Now we have $T^{-n}(A) \cap B = \emptyset$ for infinitely many $n$. Hence $\mu(T^{-n}(A) \cap B) = 0$.

To clear up the confusion that I caused, I will define a signed measure here. The literature sometimes calls it ""extended signed measure"": Definition. A signed measure $\mu$ on $(\mathbb R, \text{Borel sets})$ is a function $$\mu:\text{Borel sets}\to\mathbb R\cup\{\infty\}$$ or a function $$\mu:\text{Borel sets}\to\mathbb R\cup\{-\infty\}$$ such that $\mu(\emptyset)=0$ , for any disjoint Borel sets $A_1, A_2, A_3, \dots$ , we have $$\mu\left(\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb N} A_n\right)=\sum_{n\in\mathbb N} \mu(A_n),$$ with the convention that $\infty+\text{anything}=\infty$ and $-\infty+\text{anything}=-\infty$ . Note that $\infty-\infty$ can never occur, since $\{-\infty, \infty\}\subset\operatorname{Image}\mu$ is impossible by definition. Back to the question. Let $f\in L^1_{\text{loc}}(\mathbb R)$ , i.e. $f$ is a locally absolutely integrable function. It is well-known that the distributional derivative of $f$ doesn't have to be expressible as a $L_{\text{loc}}^1$ function again. For example, if $f$ is the characteristic function of $[0,\infty[$ (or the characteristic function of $]0,\infty[$ , for that matter), then its distributional derivative corresponds to the Dirac measure $\delta_0$ , which has no $L^1_{\text{loc}}$ -density with respect to the Lebesgue measure. Similarly, if we have a measure on $\mathbb R$ , its distributional derivative need not be a measure again. Continuing the above example, the distributional derivative of $\delta_0$ is given by the bounded linear operator \begin{split}\delta_0': \mathcal C_{\text c}^\infty(\mathbb R) &\to \mathbb R \\ \phi&\mapsto-\phi'(0),\end{split} which is not expressible as a measure on $\mathbb R$ .

98,"Find a non-negative function on [0,1] such that $t\cdot m(\{x:f(x) \geq t\}) \to 0$ that is not Lebesgue Integrable","Find a non-negative function on [0,1] such that  that is not Lebesgue Integrable",t\cdot m(\{x:f(x) \geq t\}) \to 0,"Problem: Find a non-negative function $f$ on $[0,1]$ such that $$\lim_{t\to\infty} t\cdot m(\{x : f(x) \geq t\}) = 0,$$ but $f$ is not integrable, where $m$ is Lebesgue measure. My Attempt: Let $f(x) = \frac{\chi_{(0,1]}}{\sqrt{x}}$. Then,  \begin{align*} \lim_{t\to\infty} t\cdot m(\{x \in [0,1]: f(x) \geq t\}) &= \lim_{t\to\infty} t \cdot m(\{x\in (0,1]: 1/\sqrt{x} \geq t\})\\ &=\lim_{t\to\infty} t \cdot m(\{x\in (0,1]: x \leq (1/t^2)\})\\ &= \lim_{t\to\infty} t \cdot m((0, (1/t^2)))\\ &= \lim_{t\to\infty} \frac{t}{t^2} = 0. \end{align*} However, $f(x)$ is integrable over this interval. I have tried functions looking like $f(x) = 1/x^p$ but I cannot find any that will work here. There is a hint that says there is a monotonic function that fits this description. Also, does anyone know of a list of non-Lebesgue integrable functions on $[0,1]$? I feel as though I could use this for many counterexamples if one were to exist.

99,$f$ measurable implies $\dfrac{1}{f}$ measurable,measurable implies  measurable,f \dfrac{1}{f},"Suppose $f:X\to\mathbb{R}$ is Borel-measurable over a measurable space $X$, and $f(x)\neq 0$ for each $x\in X$. I want to prove that $\dfrac 1f$ is measurable. Let $a\in\mathbb{R}$. I tried to prove that $\{x\in X:\dfrac{1}{f(x)}>a\}$ is measurable. Of course if $a>0$ then $\{x\in X:\dfrac{1}{f(x)}>a\}=\{x\in X:\dfrac 1a>f(x)\}$, hence measurable, but what if $a<0$? Any hint?
