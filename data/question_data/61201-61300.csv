Let $E$ be a free module on $e_1,\ldots,e_m$ (for our purposes $E$ being a finite dimensional complex vector space will do) and consider the module $E^\lambda$ as constructed earlier in the chapter. If $e_T$ is the vector as defined in the paragraph before Lemma 1 of page 107, the Theorem states: Theorem 1 (pg 110): The module $E^\lambda$ is free on $e_T$ as $T$ varies over the tableaux on $\lambda$ with entries in $\{1,\ldots,m\}$. Now Fulton begins by arguing that all such $e_T$ have to generate $E^\lambda$ as follows. He uses the presentation $E^\lambda = F/Q$ of Lemma 1 and orders the tableau as follows: $T' > T$ if in the right most column where they differ, the entry in $T'$ is larger than $T$. Now to show that the $e_{T'}$ with $T'$ a tableau generate $E^\lambda$, we need to show that if $T$ is not a tableau then we can write $e_T$ as a linear combination of $e_S$ where $e_S$ are tableau. Using the relations of Lemma 1, we can assume that the columns of $T$ are strictly increasing.

[ Motivation : A formula for the number of bijections would help me with a program I'm writing, in which I'm summing over all bijections from $P$ to $Q$ (which happen to be number partitions).  I hope to use symmetry breaking to reduce the redundant iterations.] Addendum (motivated by hardmath's comment, and so I can add the [graph-theory] tag): A rephrasing of this question is: Question : What is the number of bipartite multigraphs, with vertex bipartition $V_1 \cup V_2$, whose vertices have prescribed degrees? For the above question to be non-zero, we require $\sum_{v \in V_1} \mathrm{deg}(v)=\sum_{v \in V_2} \mathrm{deg}(v)$, where $\mathrm{deg}(v)$ is the degree of vertex $v$,counting multi-edges with their multiplicity. In the above example, $V_1=\{1,3\}$, with degrees $3$ and $1$, respectively, and $V_2=\{1',2'\}$, with degrees $2$ and $2$, respectively.  The two bipartite multigraphs have edge multisets $\{\{1,1'\},\{1,1'\},\{1,2'\},\{3,2'\}\}$ and $\{\{1,1'\},\{3,1'\},\{1,2'\},\{1,2'\}\}$.",,"['combinatorics', 'graph-theory', 'elementary-set-theory', 'multisets']"
12,What is the minimal number of pieces to surround n pieces in a Go game?,What is the minimal number of pieces to surround n pieces in a Go game?,,"Go is a game of black and white pieces on a lattice of $19\times 19$ . Pieces have liberty by having empty spaces next to them and are killed if the liberty are occupied by the opponent. Pieces are connected if they are next to each other (vertical/horizontal connection only, not diagonal connection) and share their liberty. For the problem, we assume it's played on an infinite lattice $\mathbb{Z}^2$ . The problem is, for $n$ pieces, what is the least liberty they can have? for example, for two pieces, we can make it like XX and there will be $6$ liberty, make it XOX then $7$ , and XOOX then $8$ . Then the answer is $6$ . Here is the construction for small numbers . we have a conjecture on OEIS saying that the answer is $2+\lceil\sqrt{8n-4}\rceil$ . But It doesn't have the proof, or at least I didn't see it. I have some trivial thinking about the problem: This minimum value must exist and can be reached. Since they are all integers, this is obvious. The pieces must be connected. For situations where they are not connected, connecting them can reduce the amount of liberty. (Edit: for $n=2$ , this is incorrect, because the direct or diagonal connection both give $6$ , meaning the proof is invalid. Probably the statement is ""it has to be connected or 'connected' diagonally, and we can always find a connected construction if a non-connected solution exists."" And for greater $n$ , this statement should be right. But I can't yet prove it.) For a shape of $n$ pieces, you can always take away a piece from the edge and achieve the same number of liberty or less. This is not obvious enough because you have to choose ""convex"" edges, otherwise he will actually have more liberty. We need to prove that there is always a point that can be taken away so that the number of liberty does not increase. Our idea of ​​proof is: if all the pieces are ""concave"", the number of pieces will explode to infinity. First, when taking away a piece, we check whether there are pieces in all four directions. For example, the piece's coordinates are $(a, b)$ , then we check $x<a, x>a, y<a, y>a$ whether there are pieces in the four regions. Once there are no pieces in one of the regions, then this is the piece we want to take away, since at this time, there are only three positions around the piece that can affect the changes of liberty upon removal. Just enumerate all possibilities. And if there are always pieces in the four directions, we will find that the distribution of pieces is unbounded, which contradicts with the finite number of chess pieces. This sequence is constant or increasing. This is a corollary of 3. The chess shape that reaches the minimum value should have no eyes (meaning holes inside the shape), and even if it does have eyes, there will be a solution without eyes. For the case where there are eyes, just remove a piece from the edge and fill in the eyes (this is also a corollary of 3). Can anyone figure out or find the full proof?","Go is a game of black and white pieces on a lattice of .

An ant at point $(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n})$ wants to get to the point $(a_{n+1},a_{n+2},\ldots,a_{2n},a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n)$. At the beginning of each second, it considers the foremost bit (i.e., the earliest bit from the left) in which its current position differs from its destination, and wants to take the edge to fix that bit. However, each edge can be traversed by at most one ant in a second. The traversal of one edge takes exactly one second. What is the minimum time for all ants to reach their destination?

37,Special Products of Transpositions,Special Products of Transpositions,,"[ Edit. Significantly expanded to add examples and (I hope) clarification. Feel free to skim by reading the gray boxes.] A colleague asked me for insights on a collection of special permutations, but I'm afraid the topic falls a little outside of my realm of expertise. The permutations in question can be described thusly: Permutations (on $n$ symbols) that are a product of $n$ transpositions with the cycle notation form $$(1,s_1)(2,s_2)(3,s_3)\cdots(n,s_n) \qquad\qquad (\star)$$ That is, the $i$th ""factor"" of the permutation exchanges the item at position $i$ with the item at position $s_i$, where we assume $i\neq s_i$. Note that $(\star)$ is a ""recipe"" for a permutation, not the permutation's decomposition into orbits. Note also that there are $(n-1)^n$ recipes, but only $n!$ permutations of $n$ symbols. Multiple recipes give rise to the same permutation. For instance, for $n=3$, we have $2^3=8$ recipes $(1a)(2b)(3c)$, resulting in just $3$ permutations: $$\begin{align} (12)(23)(31)&: 123 \to 213 \to 231 \to 132 \\ (12)(21)(32)&: 123 \to 213 \to 123 \to 132 \\ (13)(21)(31)&: 123 \to 321 \to 231 \to 132 \\ \\ (13)(23)(31)&: 123 \to 321 \to 312 \to 213 \\ (12)(23)(32)&: 123 \to 213 \to 231 \to 213 \\ (13)(21)(32)&: 123 \to 321 \to 231 \to 213 \\ \\ (12)(21)(31)&: 123 \to 213 \to 123 \to 321 \\ (13)(23)(32)&: 123 \to 321 \to 312 \to 321 \end{align}$$ More briefly: $$132\;(\times 3) \qquad 213\;(\times 3) \qquad 321\;(\times 2)$$ where the ""$(\times m)$"" gives the ""multiplicity"" of the permutation (ie, the number of recipes $(\star)$ that result in it). For $n=4$, we have $3^4=81$ recipes, yielding $12$ permutations: $$\begin{align} &1234\;(\times 3)\qquad 1342\;(\times 9)\qquad 1423\;(\times 7)\\ &2143\;(\times 11)\quad\;\; 2314\;(\times 9)\qquad 2431\;(\times 6)\\ &3124\;(\times 7)\qquad 3241\;(\times 6)\qquad 3412\;(\times 7)\\ &4132\;(\times 5)\qquad 4213\;(\times 5) \qquad 4321\;(\times 6) \end{align}$$ For $n=5$, we have $4^5 = 1024$ recipes, yielding $60$ permutations: $$\begin{align} &12354\;(\times 9) \quad  \phantom{0}12435\;(\times 9) \quad  \phantom{0}12543\;(\times 8) \quad  \phantom{0}13245\;(\times 9) \quad  \phantom{0}13452\;(\times 28) \quad  13524\;(\times 21) \\ &14253\;(\times 21) \quad 14325\;(\times 8) \quad  \phantom{0}14532\;(\times 20) \quad  15234\;(\times 15) \quad  15342\;(\times 7) \quad  \phantom{0}15423\;(\times 20) \\ &21345\;(\times 9) \quad  \phantom{0}21453\;(\times 37) \quad  21534\;(\times 29) \quad  23154\;(\times 37) \quad    23415\;(\times 28) \quad  23541\;(\times 19) \\ &24135\;(\times 21) \quad  24351\;(\times 18) \quad  24513\;(\times 25) \quad  25143\;(\times 16) \quad 25314\;(\times 14) \quad  25431\;(\times 20) \\  &31254\;(\times 29) \quad  31425\;(\times 21) \quad  31542\;(\times 15) \quad  32145\;(\times 8) \quad \phantom{0}32451\;(\times 19) \quad  32514\;(\times 15) \\ &34152\;(\times 25) \quad 34215\;(\times 20) \quad 34521\;(\times 18) \quad  35124\;(\times 21) \quad  35241\;(\times 14) \quad  35412\;(\times 20) \\ &41235\;(\times 15) \quad  41352\;(\times 14) \quad 41523\;(\times 21) \quad  42153\;(\times 16) \quad  42315\;(\times 7) \quad  \phantom{0}42531\;(\times 14) \\  &43125\;(\times 20) \quad  43251\;(\times 20) \quad  43512\;(\times 20) \quad  45132\;(\times 15) \quad  45213\;(\times 15) \quad  45321\;(\times 12) \\ &51243\;(\times 12) \quad  51324\;(\times 10) \quad 51432\;(\times 17) \quad  52134\;(\times 12) \quad  52341\;(\times 6) \quad  \phantom{0}52413\;(\times 15) \\ &53142\;(\times 15) \quad  53214\;(\times 17) \quad  53421\;(\times 18) \quad 54123\;(\times 14) \quad  54231\;(\times 14) \quad  54312\;(\times 12)  \end{align}$$ And so forth. In the above, we get $n!/2$ permutations (which would necessarily mean: all the members of $S_n$ that match $n$'s parity), but it's not immediately obvious to me that this is always the case. (Certainly, we always get $n$'s-parity permutations, but do we always get all of them?) I'll point out that my colleague and I are primarily interested in even $n$ ---so that we're working within (if not with the entirety of) the alternating group, $A_n$--- but considering all $n$ may help reveal patterns. Now, my colleague and I are interested in counting the number of these special permutations ""with multiplicity"" that move items $i$, $j$, $k$ into positions $1$, $2$, $3$ (where $n \gg 3$). For instance, Among the permutations of the form $(\star)$ on the (English) alphabet, how many result in $26$-letter strings beginning with a $3$-letter word of my choosing, say, ""cat$\cdots$"" or ""dog$\cdots$""? (More generally, how many permutations yield strings starting with a $4$-, $5$-, or $m$-letter word of my choosing?) In terms of the permutations given above, I could ask questions like How many special permutations (with multiplicity) ... ... of $\phantom{45}123$ begin with $\phantom{495}2$?

Answer: $\phantom{42}8$ ... of $12345$ begin with $2431$? Answer: $\phantom{42}0$* *The first $(n-2)$ entries in the permutation determine the last $2$ (this is clear from parity), so it's possible to specify length-$(n-1)$ beginning strings that never occur. (Not that that really matters to us. In our investigation, we want to specify beginning strings of length far less than $n$.) If all we wanted was to know the number of ways item $i$ can move into position $j$, then a fairly straightforward analysis of products of permutation matrices would do. Here are resulting tabulations for $n=3,4,5,6$, where the $(i,j)$th element counts the number of permutations (with multiplicity) that move item $i$ into position $j$. $$\left( \begin{array}{ccc}  3 & 3 & 2 \\  3 & 2 & 3 \\  2 & 3 & 3 \\ \end{array} \right)\qquad \left( \begin{array}{cccc}  19 & 26 & 20 & 16 \\  23 & 14 & 24 & 20 \\  21 & 20 & 14 & 26 \\  18 & 21 & 23 & 19 \\ \end{array} \right)\qquad \left( \begin{array}{ccccc}  175 & 273 & 225 & 189 & 162 \\  229 & 138 & 252 & 216 & 189 \\  220 & 201 & 126 & 252 & 225 \\  208 & 204 & 201 & 138 & 273 \\  192 & 208 & 220 & 229 & 175 \\ \end{array} \right)$$ $$\left( \begin{array}{cccccc}  2101 & 3524 & 3024 & 2624 & 2304 & 2048 \\  2869 & 1732 & 3280 & 2880 & 2560 & 2304 \\  2805 & 2564 & 1552 & 3200 & 2880 & 2624 \\  2725 & 2580 & 2464 & 1552 & 3280 & 3024 \\  2000 & 2100 & 2180 & 2244 & 1476 & 2500 \\  2500 & 2625 & 2725 & 2805 & 2869 & 2101 \\ \end{array} \right)$$ One observes that the matrices are symmetric across the secondary diagonal. Less obviously, they indicate that there are $(n-1)^{n-1}-(n-2)^{n-1}$ ways for item $1$ to stay put, and $2(n-2)^{n-1}$ ways for item $1$ to move to position $n$. General formulas for other entries are somewhat trickier to express. These independent tallies are one thing, but I'm at a loss for how to count ""compound"" circumstances, such as (in the simplest case) $$\text{""# of ways ( item $i$ moves to position $1$ ) AND ( item $j$ moves to position $2$ )""}$$ Of course, ""brute force"" enumeration ---generating all the permutations, and counting the ones we want--- already becomes computationally intractable once $n$ nears $10$. Our suspicion is that there's effectively no good solution here. That said, it seems possible that the specific nature of the recipe $(\star)$ provides enough structure to facilitate such enumeration, perhaps through clever recursion or exploitation of some aspect of the symmetric group, $S_n$ (or, maybe, the alternating group, $A_n$). So, before my colleague shelves this particular puzzle, I thought I'd ask for pointers here. It would even be helpful to know Have these ""special permutations"" been studied in the literature? If it's true that the recipes $(\star)$ always give us half of the permutations in $S_n$, then this problem can be broken into two parts Find the $n$'s-parity members of $S_n$ that begin with a specified sequence.

I also see that this is also the same as adding a partial row of Pascal's triangle, but that didn't get me much further. I tried searching for various things both on this site and google involving various combinations of the terms n choose k , at most , summing a row of pascal's triangle , etc., which did not give many applicable results. The Question Assuming I translated the problem correctly, is there a cleaner solution than taking the sum over the different choices of $k$? If one exists, I would love to see a combinatorial explanation for it, but an algebraic one would still be sufficient.",,['combinatorics']

In the plane, three distinct fleas with integer coordinates are given. At every tick of time, two fleas sitting at the points $P$ and $Q$ can jump to two vacant points $R$ and $S$ , such that $PQRS$ is a square (in that order of vertices). If three initial coordinates of fleas are $(0, 0)$ , $(2, 0)$ and $(4, 1)$ , prove that fleas can never become collinear. More generally, find the set of all possible values missed by $2S$ , where $S$ is the area of a triangle spanned by three fleas. I intended to proposed the first part of this problem to IMO, but it turns to be too complicated. Comments. Let $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ be side lengths of a lattice triangle, $a=(\beta^2+\gamma^2-\alpha^2)/2$ , $b=(\gamma^2+\alpha^2-\beta^2)/2$ , $c=(\alpha^2+\beta^2-\gamma^2)/2$ , and $s=2S$ (we also keep track of the sign of $s$ ). The relation between these integers is given by $s^2=ab+ac+bc$ . The jump of two fleas translates into the language of quadruples $(s;a,b,c)$ as one of six transformations $(s;a,b,c)\rightarrow (s+b+c;a+b+c+2s,b,c)$ , $(s;a,b,c)\rightarrow (s-b-c;a+b+c-2s,b,c)$ , and 4 cyclic ones. We start from the collection $(2; 8, 9, -4)$ . With MAPLE I was able to calculate that, for example, only these values of $|s|\leq 20000$ can possibly be missed: $0, 1, 4, 5, 9, 11, 16, 25, 29, 35, 41, 55, 60, 64, 65, 80, 89, 101, 109, 125, 171, 191, 229, 275, 295, 299, 301, 315, 316, 336, 365, 380, 405, 476, 589, 595, 624, 635, 671, 689, 1055, 1109, 1225, 1495, 1955, 2171, 2215, 2315, 2699, 2761, 5225, 7471, 7555, 11365, 14845.$ Yet, I was not able to advance any further. At the moment, I am still not able to rigorously demonstrate that the given three points can never become collinear. In other words, that $0$ is indeed a member of the above sequence. Addition 1. The sequence written above is obtained by the following procedure. Computer calculates $g$ generations of these $6$ transformations. If we work with arrays, the total number of configurations in the $g$ -th generation would be $6^g$ . In MAPLE though, it is much faster to work with sets due to considerable overlap, as well as the fact some transformations take backwards. Thus, $10$ generations were calculated (it took several hours, but optimization is still possible in order to push this to $12$ or $13$ generations). Second, consider, for example, an ordinary member $(s; a, b, c)=(-37; 9, 20, 41)$ of the third generation. The transformations show that not only $s=-37$ is attainable value for $s$ , but also all $s$ such that $s\equiv -37\equiv 21\text{ (mod }29)$ , $s\equiv-37\equiv 13\text{ (mod }50)$ , or $s\equiv -37\equiv 24\text{ (mod }61)$ . We thus can filter out not only terms of the given generation, but all the corresponding arithmetic progressions. And third, terms of the above sequence seem to stabilize rather quickly. For example, for $g\geq 7$ (it takes only several seconds to compute) all terms of the above sequence with terms $\leq 1000$ stabilize. It gives a true belief that $s=0$ is not possible, and that the majority of the numbers written are truly not possible values for $s$ . Addition 2 ( a small progress ). We may start from an even more compact triple of points, for which the answer is not trivial. In particular, consider $(0,0)$ , $(2,1)$ and $(3,2)$ (the diameter is $\sqrt{13}$ , as compared to $\sqrt{17}$ for the initial example). This corresponds to the quadruple $(s; a,b,c)=$ $(1; -3,5,8)$ . We calculate also $10$ generations. All missed $s$ are even, and the list of missed $S=s/2\leq 1000$ is as follows: $0, 1, 4, 5, 9, 16, 25, 29, 36, 49, 64, 80, 81, 99, 100, 121, 144, 169, 179, 196, 225, 256, 289, 324, 361, 400, 441, 484, 529, 576, 625, 676, 729, 784, 841, 900, 961.$ But these are exactly integer squares, apart from five sporadic terms $5, 29, 80, 99, 179$ .

For partition $\alpha,\beta \vdash n$ , $\chi_{\alpha}(\beta)\neq 0 \implies \beta \leq (h_{11}^{\alpha}, h_{22}^{\alpha},\ldots)$ . Here $\chi_{\alpha}$ is the irreducible character of $S_n$ corresponding to $\alpha$ and $\leq$ denotes the dominance order and $h_{ij}^{\alpha}$ is the hook length at $(i,j)$ -th node of the Young diagram of $\alpha$ . The proof is not given in the book probably because it is not difficult, but I haven't been able to find a proof. Here is what I tried : Let $\beta \not\leq (h_{11}^{\alpha}, h_{22}^{\beta},\ldots)$ , then we want to prove that $\chi_{\alpha}(\beta)=0$ . The idea is to show that $\beta$ contains a cycle whose length doesn't appear as a hook length of some node in the Young diagram of $\alpha$ . Then the recursive Nakayama-Murnaghan rule immediately yields the result. Also notice that for any partition $\alpha$ , $h_{11}^{\alpha}$ cannot be too small. Let $P(n)$ be the set of all partition of $n$ . Then we can consider the map $\Delta:P(n)\to P(n)$ given by $\alpha \mapsto (h_{11}^{\alpha}, h_{22}^{\alpha},\ldots)$ . If $n=6$ , one can check that the image of $\Delta$ is the set $\{(6), (5,1), (4,2)\}$ . This shows that the least possible value of $h_{11}^{\alpha}$ is 4. In general, it seems that for any $\alpha \vdash n$ , $h_{11}^{\alpha}\geq \frac{n}{2}+1$ if $n$ is even and $h_{11}^{\alpha}\geq \frac{n+3}{2}$ if $n$ is odd. From this it seemed to me that if $\beta=(\beta_1,\beta_2,\ldots)$ and $\beta \not\leq (h_{11}^{\alpha},h_{22}^{\alpha},\ldots)$ , then $\beta_1>h_{11}^{\alpha}$ . If it were to be true then since $h_{11}^{\alpha}$ is the highest hook lenght in $\alpha$ , it would have followed that $\beta_1$ cannot be a hook length in the diagram of $\alpha$ . But the conclusion that $\beta_1>h_{11}^{\alpha}$ can be easily seen to be false. For example - If $\alpha=(5,3,3)\vdash 11$ , then taking $\beta=(6,5)$ , it is clearly seen that $\beta\not\leq (7,3,1)=(h_{11}^{\alpha},h_{22}^{\alpha},h_{33}^{\alpha})$ but $\beta_1=6<h_{11}^{\alpha}$ . One can deduce some more restriction on the partition $(h_{11}^{\alpha}, h_{22}^{\alpha},\ldots,)$ . For example $h_{ii}^{\alpha}\leq h_{jj}^{\alpha}-2$ where $j=i-1$ and so on. But with all these I haven't been able to get the correct argument. I think there is some easy observation that I am overlooking. Any help will be highly appreciated.

In fact, $10+1$, $10+3$, $10+7$ and $10+9$ are all primes. Conversely, for the twentieth ten the association reads $20 \rightarrow \{\}$, since there are no primes between $200$ and $209$. It is easy to see that each ten is associated to one (and only one) group of symbols, chosen among the following $16$ distinct alternatives: $\{\}$, $\{1\}$, $\{3\}$, $\{7\}$, $\{9\}$, $\{1,3\}$, $\{1,7\}$, $\{1,9\}$,  $\{3,7\}$, $\{3,9\}$, $\{7,9\}$, $\{1,3,7\}$, $\{1,3,9\}$, $\{1,7,9\}$, $\{3,7,9\}$, $\{1,3,7,9\}$. For the sake of simplicity, we can identify each of these $16$ distinct groups of symbols  with a single symbol, or with a single color , as illustrated below: Each of these colors represents how many prime numbers there are in one ten (and which ones). In practice, we have just split the complexity of primes into tens and colors. This allows us to rearrange the colors within the Pascal's triangle, by means of the associated ten, obtaining the following scheme (the numbers in the squares represent the tens): The complexity of the primes sequence has been now split into rows, diagonals  and colors. An advantage of such representation is that it mixes groups of primes related to far tens, allowing maybe to identify patterns and/or to dig out connections among already known integer sequences.

You can only move to a point $(a,b,c)$ such that $0\leq a \leq p, \ 0 \leq b \leq q,\ 0 \leq c \leq r$. i.e. you have to stay in the ""$p,q,r$"" prism. You can't move to a point that you have already moved. From a point $(a,b,c)$ you can move to one of the points $(a+1,b,c),(a-1,b,c),(a,b+1,c),(a,b-1,c),(a,b,c+1),(a,b,c-1)$ which satisfy above conditions i.e. you can move 1 unit step in one of the three coordinates. We denote $f(p,q,r)$ as different ways of reaching $(p,q,r)$ from $(0,0,0)$ as described above. Is there a closed formula or a recurrence relation for $f(p,q,r)$? Ideas: I know that if we change the 4th restriction with ""you can only move in the positive directions"" then the answer is $\frac{(p+q+r)!}{p!q!r!}$. So $f(p,q,r)$ is larger than this number. Second condition makes it very difficult to use induction or recurrence relation. Working on two dimensional version of the problem doesn't make it simple. I believe this problem must have appeared somewhere. Any references, hints are welcomed. Thank you for reading the entire entry.",,['combinatorics']

At this point I seek to count the following: in how many ways can I merge both lists together, in such a way that the relative ordering of Type-A and Type-B elements, respectively, is preserved? (i.e. that if $P_M(x)$ represents the position of an element of A or B in the merged list, then $P_M(a_i)<P_M(a_j)$ and $P_M(b_i)<P_M(b_j)$ for all $i<j$) I've tried to figure this out constructively by starting with an empty merged list and inserting elements of A or B one at a time, counting in how many ways each insertion can be done, but since this depends on the placement of previous elements of the same type, I've had little luck so far. I also tried explicitly counting all possibilities for different (small) lengths of A and B, but I've been unable to extract any potential general principle in this way.","Suppose that, for a real application, I have ended up with a sorted list A = {$a_1, a_2, ..., a_{|A|}$} of elements of a certain kind (say, Type-A), and another sorted list B = {$b_1, b_2, ..., b_{|B|}$} of elements of a different kind (Type-B), such that Type-A elements are only comparable with Type-A elements, and likewise for Type-B.
