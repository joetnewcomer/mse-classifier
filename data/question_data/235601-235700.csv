Similarly $c\neq \{c, d\}$. Now $a\in \{c, \{c, d\}\}$ so either $a = c$ or $a= \{c, d\}$. If the latter is true, then we have $$ c = \{ a, b\} = \{ \{ c, d\} , b\}$$ This implies $$c \in \{ c, d\} \in c$$ and it is not allowed. Thus $a=c$. So $$\{a, b\} = \{c, d\} = \{ a, d\}$$ and from there we can show also $b=d$. Question : This results is stated in p.8 of this book , but they never mention that infinite chain is not allowed.

Now the last part can mean two very different things, and I will translate the rest of this sentence to show that.

Now in my translation of what Munkres has written, ""If $A$ is a subset of $Y$"" could mean one of two things, either $A \subset Y$ $A \subset \mathcal{T_y}$ $(1)$ Above is a subset of $Y$, the underlying set of the subspace, whereas $(2)$ above is a subset of the topology $\mathcal{T_y}$ of the subspace and is a collection of subsets of $Y$ , very different to the meaning $(1)$ has.

He then goes on to note: The Axiom of Extensionality implies that only one empty set exists, ... Now, here's my problem. In its formulation, the Axiom of Extensionality uses the membership of some existing ""thing"" $x$ to establish ""sameness"" of two sets. But since $x$ is an existing ""thing"", how is Extensionality even relevant to $\emptyset$ , which, by definition, contains no existing ""things""? It seems to me that we cannot establish that there exists exactly one $\emptyset$ , since the very notion of ""sameness"" is built upon existing $x$ 's being members of sets, and $\emptyset$ contains no existent $x$ 's. Addendum So if I understand correctly, my misinterpretation of Extensionality lies in this: I interpreted $x \in A$ as a demand for existing $x$ 's to be a part of sets in order for them to be the same set. But what Extensionality really says is that: $A = B \Longleftrightarrow (\forall x)[x \in A \Longleftrightarrow x \in B]$ holds for all $x$ 's. Then indeed, it follows that: $$ A = \emptyset, \; B = \emptyset' \\ A = B \Longleftrightarrow (\forall x)[x \in A \Longleftrightarrow x \in B], $$ since it holds for both $A$ and $B$ that they have no members, hence every member that is a member of $A$ will be a member of $B$ — that is to say, no member. While thinking about it, I came up with an interesting ""modification"" of $\text{ZFC}$ . Instead of conceiving of $\emptyset$ as a set without members, let us denote nothing as $\mathfrak{n}$ . $\mathfrak{n}$ is an element of every set. More specifically, we define $\emptyset$ as $\emptyset := \{ \mathfrak{n} \}$ . With this setup, my interpretation of Extensionality holds for all sets.

In other words i want to know if this can work as stand alone proof. EDIT 3: I can use the following : If the size of the natural numbers set $\mathbb{N}$ is less than or equal to the size of a set $F$ then $F$ is infinite. $\mathbb{N}$ is less than or equal to $F$ iff there is an injective function from $\mathbb{N}$ to $F$",,['elementary-set-theory']

Prove that $\mathfrak{M}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra in $X$ and that $\mu$ is a measure on $\mathfrak{M}$. Describe the corresponding measurable functions and their integrals. I showed that $\mathfrak{M}$ is $\sigma$-algebra and $\mu$ is a masure on $\mathfrak{M}$. But I have some problems with description of measurable functions. Here's my thought: Let's consider measurable functions $f:X\to [-\infty,+\infty]$. If function $f$ is measurable then $f^{-1}(\{a\})\in \mathfrak{M}$ for any $a\in [-\infty,+\infty]$. Hence either $f^{-1}(\{a\})$ or $(f^{-1}(\{a\}))^c$ is at most countable. What's next? I would be very thankful is somebody show to me a detailed proof of this. I thought on this problem about 1.5 day but no results.","Let $X$ be an uncountable set, let $\mathfrak{M}$ be the collection of all sets $E\subset X$ such that either $E$ or $E^c$ is at most countable, and define $\mu(E) = 0$ in the first case, $\mu(E) = 1$ in the second.
