22,Is this a valid way to show that the recursive sequence $x_n = x_{n-1} + \frac{1}{x_{n-1}^2}$ is unbounded?,Is this a valid way to show that the recursive sequence  is unbounded?,x_n = x_{n-1} + \frac{1}{x_{n-1}^2},"I'm working through some analysis textbooks on my own, so I don't want the full answer. I'm only looking for a hint on this problem. Rosenlicht's Introduction to Analysis asks me to prove that $x_n = x_{n-1} + \frac{1}{x_{n-1}^2}$, where $x_1 = 1$, is unbounded. I'm not sure how to approach this, but here's what I tried. To save myself typing, I let $b := x_n$ and $a := x_{n-1}$. Since $b > a > 1$ as $n \to \infty$, we know that \begin{align} b &> a \\ e^{\ln b} &> e^{\ln a} \\ \frac{e^{\ln b}}{e^{\ln a}} &> 1 \\ e^{\ln b - \ln a} &> 1 \end{align} but I'm not sure where to go from here, or if this is even the right direction. I'm trying to show that $b - a > \ln b - \ln a$, because then I can say that the sequence is always growing faster than the logarithmic function, which I know is unbounded. To show that $b - a > \ln b - \ln a$, I tried proof by contradiction. If $b - a \le \ln b - \ln a$, then $e^{b-a} \le e^ {\ln b - \ln a}$. Thus $\frac{e^b}{e^a} \le \frac{e^{\ln b}}{e^{\ln a}} = \frac{b}{a}$, and once again I'm not sure where to go. I know that to show something is bounded, I need to show that $\exists M > 0$ s.t. $x_n < M, \forall n$. I know how to do that with non-recursive sequences, e.g. $x_n = f(n), n \in \mathbb{N}$ because it's just algebra, but I'm not sure how to go about this with a recursive sequence (once that I wasn't successful at putting in non-recursive terms).","I'm working through some analysis textbooks on my own, so I don't want the full answer.

Given the first and n -th values in an arithmetic progression, and the sum of the progression up to n (inclusive), give the first x terms of the series. The actual question on the quiz In an arithmetic series, the terms of the series are equally spread out. For example, in   1 + 5 + 9 + 13 + 17, consecutive terms are 4 apart. If the first term in an arithmetic series is 3, the last term is 136, and the sum is 1,390, what are the first 3 terms?

I got the correct answer in a reasonable amount of time, but mostly because I worked backwards and double checked my answer.  After I was done, I tried to find math on the net to solve it correctly, but I feel there is probably a simpler solution than this. Is there an easier way to solve problems in this template? Given the first and n -th values in an arithmetic progression, and the sum of the progression up to n (inclusive), give the first x terms of the series. The actual question on the quiz In an arithmetic series, the terms of the series are equally spread out. For example, in   1 + 5 + 9 + 13 + 17, consecutive terms are 4 apart. If the first term in an arithmetic series is 3, the last term is 136, and the sum is 1,390, what are the first 3 terms?
