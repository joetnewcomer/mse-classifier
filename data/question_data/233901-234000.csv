Given a set $A$, which is a infinite set, another set $B$, which is a subset of $\mathbb{N}$. If there exists a function/map $f$ s.t. $f: B\to A$, the function $f$ is onto. Then the set $A$ is countable. Our definition of countable is that a set $X$ is countable if and only if it is numerically equivalent to any subset of $\mathbb{N}$.

That is, members of $U$ are open intervals in $\mathbb{R}$ and any two distinct members of $U$ are disjoint. Show that $U$ is countable. My attempted proof: Let $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be a collection of pairwise disjoint opern intervals. Let $(a,b) \subseteq U$ be one such interval. Since $\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$, there exists a rational number $q_{a,b} \in (a,b)$. Define $f: U \to \mathbb{Q}$ by $f((a,b))=q_{a,b}$. As $f(a_1,b_1)=f(a_2,b_2)$, or $q_{a_1,b_1}=q_{a_2,b_2}$, implies $(a_1,b_1)=(a_2,b_2)$, we deduce that $f$ is injective.

My attempted proof: Let $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be a collection of pairwise disjoint opern intervals. Let $(a,b) \subseteq U$ be one such interval. Since $\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$, there exists a rational number $q_{a,b} \in (a,b)$. Define $f: U \to \mathbb{Q}$ by $f((a,b))=q_{a,b}$. As $f(a_1,b_1)=f(a_2,b_2)$, or $q_{a_1,b_1}=q_{a_2,b_2}$, implies $(a_1,b_1)=(a_2,b_2)$, we deduce that $f$ is injective.
