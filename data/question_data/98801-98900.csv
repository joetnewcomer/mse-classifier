For the sake of clarity of notation, I rearrange the promblem as follows: Let $C_1$ and $C_2$ be two arcs in the unit disc $\mathbb{D}$ with the same end points $a,b\in\partial\mathbb{D}$ . Show that $C_1$ and $C_2$ are parallel arcs with respect to the Poincare metric or equivalent the Hyperbolic distance. My Idea: It's known that the Hyperbolic distance in the unit disc with respect to the Poincare metric of $\mathbb{D}$ can be expressed as $d_{\rho_{\mathbb{D}}}(z_1,z_2)=\ln\frac{1+\left|\frac{z_1-z_2}{1-\overline{z_1}z_2}\right|}{1-\left|\frac{z_1-z_2}{1-\overline{z_1}z_2}\right|}$ . And as the definition of parallelism, it suffices to show that $\forall z\in C_1$ , $d_{\rho_{\mathbb{D}}}(z,C_2)$ is a constant. But as a matter of fact, computing the distance explicitly is virtually impossible. And as I encounter this problem in my complex analysis course, I do not known much about the hyberbolic geometry theory.

In particular, I have $|f(z)|\lt \exp(|z|^{\beta})$ holds for all large enough $|z|$ , where $\beta=\mu+1$ . Now, using a previous estimate , I get $$|c_n|\leq \Bigl(\frac{e\beta}{n}\Bigl)^{n/\beta}$$ for all large enough $n$ .

Also, the definition of the ""genus""(order) mentioned in the above post comes only after this exercise in Conway(Exercise $2.5$ ). Here's the definition of the order Conway uses: Definition. An entire function $f$ is of finite order if there is a positive constant $a$ and an $r_0\gt0$ such that $|f(z)|\lt \exp(|z|^a)$ for $|z|\gt r_0$ . If $f$ is of finite order, then $$\lambda=\inf\{a\mid |f(z)|\lt \exp(|z|^a)\,\text{for $|z|$ sufficiently large}\}$$ is called the order of $f$ . Equivalently, $$\lambda=\limsup_{r\to\infty}\frac{\log\log M(r)}{\log r},$$ where $M(r)=\max\{|f(z)|\mid|z|=r\}$ .

First example, if I choose $\sqrt{\,}$ to denote the branch defined on $(-\pi,\pi)$ : $a = e^{\frac{2}{5}\pi i}$ and $b = e^{\frac{2}{3}\pi i}$ I get that $a\sqrt{b} \ne \sqrt{a^2b}$ , because: $$a\sqrt{b} = e^{\frac{2}{5}\pi i} \cdot e^{\frac{1}{3}\pi i} = e^{\frac{11}{15}\pi i}$$ $$\sqrt{a^2b} = \sqrt{e^{\frac{4}{5}\pi i}\cdot e^{\frac{2}{3}\pi i}} = \sqrt{e^{\frac{22}{15}\pi i}} = \sqrt{e^{\frac{-8}{15}\pi i}} = e^{\frac{-4}{15}\pi i}$$ notice the step in the end of the last line where I need to fix the exponent by subtracting $2\pi$ so that the exponent will be between $-\pi$ and $\pi$ . If I didn't ""fix"" it, I would've got the result I wanted. Well this obviously didn't work. so my question is what failed and for which branches the common rules for powers work like for real-valued roots and powers? Second example, which is related but a bit more complicated: Calculate: $$ \int_{|z|=5} \frac{1}{\sqrt{z^2+11}} dz$$ where $\sqrt{\,}$ denotes the branch for which $\sqrt{36}=-6$ . Firstly, it is not obvious to me if $\sqrt{z^2+11}$ is even meromorphic, because $z^2+11$ has roots in the interior of the contour, so why is this integral defined correctly?

Is this the right explanation?

To find the radius of the convergence, we need to firstly transform the summand into the form of power series. So I simply wrote down the formula as: \begin{align*} e^{-nz}\cos(nz)&=\Big(\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\dfrac{(-nz)^{k}}{k!}\Big)\Big(\sum_{\ell=0}^{\infty}\dfrac{(-1)^{\ell}}{(2\ell)!}(nz)^{2\ell}\Big)\\ &=\Big(\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\dfrac{(-1)^{k}n^{k}}{k!}z^{k}\Big)\Big(\sum_{\ell=0}^{\infty}\dfrac{(-1)^{\ell}n^{2\ell}}{(2\ell)!}z^{2\ell}\Big)\\ &:=\Big(\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}a_{k}z^{k}\Big)\Big(\sum_{\ell=0}^{\infty}b_{\ell}z^{2\ell}\Big)\\ &=\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\Big(\sum_{\substack{k+2\ell=m \\ k,\ell\geq 0}}a_{k}b_{\ell}\Big)z^{m}. \end{align*} But then I don't know how to proceed, as then if I sum over $n$ , the coefficients are still not clear enough to calculate the radius of convergence.

(1) I am sorry for forgetting to mention that $z\in\mathbb{C}$ . Thus, it seems not sufficient to argue only for $z\in\mathbb{R}$ . (2) This problem has a follow-up part (b) asking me to argue if $f(z)$ can be extended analytically to a larger domain.

Therefore, I think we need to find a power series expansion of $f(z)$ and then ""return"" it to a function, just like what Viktor Glombik suggested. I am currently trying to show what Viktor Glombik could not prove, and I would post my proof here if I came up one. Thank all of you so much for your discussion and answers! Edit 2: Following the idea of Viktor Glombik, I think I prove the whole problem now. In this edition, I will first post the whole problem and then post my proof. The proof greatly follows Viktor Glombik. Consider the function $f(z)$ defined by the series $$f(z):=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}e^{-nz}\cos(nz).$$ (1) Find the domain of $f$ defined by the convergence of the series. (2) Can $f$ be extended analytically to a larger domain? If so, find the maximal domain of the extension and classify its singularities. Proof (1): Note that $$\cos (nz)=\dfrac{e^{inz}+e^{-inz}}{2},$$ so that we have $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}e^{-nz}\cos(nz)=\dfrac{1}{2}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}e^{(i-1)nz}+\dfrac{1}{2}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}e^{-(i+1)nz}.$$ Both sums are geometric sum with $$r_{1}=e^{(i-1)z},\ r_{2}=e^{-(i+1)z},$$ which converges if and only if $$|r_{1}|<1,\ \text{and}\ |r_{2}|<1.$$ Write $z:=x+iy$ for $x,y\in\mathbb{R}$ , then we have $$|r_{1}|=\Big|e^{i(x-y)}e^{-y-x}\Big|=\Big|e^{-(y+x)}\Big|=e^{-(y+x)},$$ and $$|r_{2}|=\Big|e^{i(-x-y)}e^{y-x}\Big|=\Big|e^{y-x}\Big|=e^{y-x}.$$ Then, we have $$|r_{1}|<1\implies e^{y+x}>1\implies y+x>0\implies y>-x,$$ $$|r_{2}|<1\implies e^{y-x}<1\implies y-x<0\implies y<x.$$ Thus, the domain of the convergence is the set $$\mathcal{A}:=\{z\in\mathbb{C}:-\Re(z)<\Im(z)<\Re(z)\}.$$ Proof (2): Now, define the partial sums $$S_{1,k}:=\dfrac{1}{2}\sum_{n=0}^{k}r_{1}^{n},\ S_{2,k}:=\dfrac{1}{2}\sum_{n=0}^{k}r_{2}^{n}.$$ Then, by the summation formula of geometric series, we have $$S_{1,k}=\dfrac{1}{2}\times\dfrac{1-r_{1}^{k+1}}{1-r_{1}},\ S_{2,k}=\dfrac{1}{2}\times\dfrac{1-r_{2}^{k+1}}{1-r_{2}}.$$ Now, for all $z\in\mathcal{A}$ , taking $k\rightarrow\infty$ yields us $$f(z)=\dfrac{1}{2}\Big(\dfrac{1}{1-e^{(i-1)z}}\Big)+\dfrac{1}{2}\Big(\dfrac{1}{1-e^{-(i+1)z}}\Big).$$ It is then clear that the singularities are those $z\in\mathbb{C}$ that make \begin{align*} &e^{(i-1)z}=1,\ \text{or}\ e^{-(i+1)z}=1 \\ \iff &(i-1)z=2k\pi i,\ \text{or}\ (i+1)z=-2k\pi i,\ k\in\mathbb{Z}.\\ \iff &z=(1-i)k\pi,\ \text{or}\ z=-(1+i)k\pi,\ k\in\mathbb{Z}. \end{align*} Therefore, for all $z\in\mathbb{C}\setminus\Big(\{z=(1-i)k\pi,\ k\in\mathbb{Z}\}\cup\{z=-(1+i)k\pi,\ k\in\mathbb{Z}\}\Big),$ $$f(z):=\dfrac{1}{2}\Big(\dfrac{1}{1-e^{(i-1)z}}\Big)+\dfrac{1}{2}\Big(\dfrac{1}{1-e^{-(i+1)z}}\Big)$$ is an analytic continuation of $f(z)$ .

Moreover, it can be shown that equality holds precisely when $f$ is linear, $f(z)=a_0 + a_1z$ . This problem is quoted directily from the book. The first part of the question (the inequality) is not difficult once the hint was given. However, I have been thinking about the second part (precisely) for ages. It seems like Exe.9 in the book may have contributions to this question or just say the ""Schwarz Lemma"" related to conformal mappings. But what I am struggling with is I cannot restrict the image of $f$ to get a $D \rightarrow D$ map. Therefore I cannot meet the assumptions of ""Schwarz Lemma"". How can this proposition be proved? Exe.9 (Conclusion): Let $Ω$ be a bounded open subset of $C$ , and $ϕ : Ω → Ω$ a holomorphic function. If there exists a point $z_0 ∈ Ω$ such that $ϕ(z_0) = z_0$ and $ϕ'(z_0) = 1$ then $ϕ$ is linear. Schwarz Lemma: Let $f : D → D$ be holomorphic with $f(0) = 0$ .

Note that, by Cauchy formula, $f'(0)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{C_r} \frac{f(\xi)}{\xi^2} d\xi$ = $-\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{C_r} \frac{f(-\xi)}{\xi^2} d\xi$ . Hence, $2f'(0)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{C_r} \frac{f(\xi)-f(-\xi)}{\xi^2} d\xi$ .

It is easy to see that $h: [0,1] \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is continuous, $h(0) = 1$ , $h(1) = 0$ . Let $r_0 = \sup \{ r ; h(r) = 1 \}$ ; then $h(r_0) = 1$ , $r_0 < 1$ and $h(r) < 1$ , if $r > r_0$ . Let $a$ be chosen with $|a| = r_0$ and $|f'(a)| = K(r_0)$ , then $$ \textbf{(1.5)} \ |f'(a)| = (1 - r_0)^{-1}.$$ Now if $|z - a| = \frac{1}{2} (1 - r_0) = \rho_0$ , $|z| < \frac{1}{2} (1 + r_0)$ ; since $r_0 < \frac{1}{2} (1 + r_0)$ , the definition of $r_0$ gives $\textbf{(1.6)} |f'(z)| \leq K(\frac{1}{2} (1 + r_0)) = h(\frac{1}{2} (1 + r_0)) [ 1 - \frac{1}{2} (1 + r_0) ]^{-1} < [ 1 - \frac{1}{2} (1 + r_0) ]^{-1} = \frac{1}{\rho_0}$ for $|z - a| < \rho_0$ . Combining $(1.5)$ and $(1.6)$ gives $$|f'(z) - f'(a)| \leq |f'(z)| + |f'(a)| < \frac{3}{2} \rho_0.$$ According to Schwarz's Lemma , this implies that $$|f'(z) - f'(a)| < \frac{3 |z - a|}{2 \rho_0^2}$$ for $z \in B(a;\rho_0)$ . Hence if $z \in S = B(a; \frac{\rho_0}{3})$ , $$|f'(z) - f'(a)| < \frac{1}{2\rho_0} = |f'(a)|$$ By lemma $1.4$ , $f$ is one-one on $S$ . It remains to show that $f(S)$ contains a disk of radius $\frac{1}{72}$ . For this define $g: B(0;\frac{\rho_0}{3}) \longrightarrow \mathbb{C}$ by $g(z) = f(z+a) - f(a)$ , then $g(0) = 0$ , $|g'(0)| = |f'(a)| = (2 \rho_0)^{-1}$ . If $z \in B(0; \frac{\rho_0}{3})$ , then the line segment $\gamma = [a,a+z]$ lies in $S \subset B(a;\rho_0)$ . So by (1.6) $$|g(z)| = |\int_{\gamma} f'(w) dw | \leq \frac{1}{\rho_0} |z| < \frac{1}{3}.$$ Applying lemma $1.2$ gives that $$g(B(0;\frac{\rho_0}{3}) \supset B(0, \sigma)$$ where $$\sigma = \frac{\left( \frac{\rho_0}{3} \right)^2 \left( \frac{1}{2\rho_0} \right)^2}{6 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)} = \frac{1}{72}$$ If this is translated into a statement about $f$ , it yields that $$f(S) \supset B \left( f(a); \frac{1}{72} \right). \square$$","I would like to understand how the Schwarz's lemma gives a bound for in the following theorem,  which is a theorem of Conway's book: Let be an analytic function on a region containing the closure of the disk and satisfying and , then there is a disk on which is one-one and such that contains a disk of radius .

97,Faithful action of $\operatorname{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q})$ on dessins of genus $0$,Faithful action of  on dessins of genus,\operatorname{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q}) 0,"In a nearly classic paper of '94, L. Schneps recalls a proof by Lenstra of the fact that the absolute Galois group acts faithfully on Shabat polynomials (i.e. on trees). As immediate corollary, she has that the absolute Galois group acts faithfully on dessins of genus $0$. I don't understand why it suffices to give the proof for trees in order to show the claim for general dessins. In fact, a dessin of genus $0$ could have more than one face, unlike trees that have only one face. Moreover, a ""multifaced"" (having more than one face) dessin is not isomorphic to a tree. So, how can she deduce the faithfulness of the action on the whole collection of dessins of genus $0$ through Lenstra's theorem?","In a nearly classic paper of '94, L.

So far I can show that for disk $D$ centered at $z_k$, $\{f_n\}$ converges uniformly on $D$ if  $\{f_n^{(i)}(z_k)\}$ converges for all $i$.
