5,Newman's proof of the Asymptotic Formula for the Partition Function,Newman's proof of the Asymptotic Formula for the Partition Function,,"I'm working on Donald J. Newman's proof that $p(n) \sim \frac{1}{4\sqrt{3}n}e^{\pi\sqrt{\frac{2n}{3}}}$, as found in Chapter II of his book Analytic Number Theory . Here's what we have so far: the generating function for general partitions is $F(z) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}p(n)z^n$, which is a Taylor series of some kind. We can therefore conclude that for any $n\in\mathbb{N}$, $$p(n) = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_C \frac{F(z)}{z^{n+1}}dz$$ for some closed curve $C$ around the origin. That's fine and looks promising. So we need $F$ in a form that lets us perform the integration. A long-known fact is that the generating function $F$ can be written as $F(z) = \prod_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{1-z^k}$. Next, we take logs and find after some algebra that $$\ln (F(z)) = \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{j}\frac{1}{z^{-j}-1}.$$ Then letting $z=e^{-w}$ for some $w\in\mathbb{C}$ with Re$(w)$ approaching $0$ from the positive side, we get $$\ln (F(e^{-w})) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{k}\frac{1}{e^{kw}-1}.$$ Using a Taylor expansion for $\frac{1}{e^{kw}-1}$ that converges for $w$ near $0$, we find that near $0$, $$\ln (F(e^{-w})) = \frac{\pi^2}{6w} + \frac{1}{2}\ln (1-e^{-w}) + \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{k}\Bigg(\frac{1}{e^{kw}-1} - \frac{1}{kw} + \frac{e^{-kw}}{2}\Bigg) .$$ This sum, according to Newman, is essentially a Riemann sum, so taking some $h>0$, he indicates the general result that if $f$ is any real function with an integral that converges from $0$ to $\infty$, then $$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}f(kh)h - \int_{0}^{\infty}f(x)dx < hV(f),$$ where $V(f)$ is the total variation of $f$ from $0$ to $\infty$. I'm assuming this means the supremum of $f$ minus its infimum on that interval. Then things get messier. Newman takes $w=he^{i\theta}$ for some $\theta \in \big(-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}\big)$, which keeps its real part positive, while $h$ keeps it small. That's fine, but then he says that we can use our Riemann sum estimate to conclude that $$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}F(khe^{i\theta})h - \int_{0}^{\infty}F(xe^{i\theta})dx < hV_{\theta}(F),$$ where $V_{\theta}(F)$ is the variation of the argument of $F$ 'along the ray'. I don't know what that means. Is the ray the real line? Is that the argument of $F$'s image, or the argument of the variable we plug into $F$, or what? How does this inequality follow from the first? Also, isn't $F$ a complex function with a complex image, and if so how do we make sense of integrating it along the real line? Newman goes on to say that this means $$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}F(kw)w - \int_{0}^{\infty}F(xe^{i\theta})d(xe^{i\theta}) < w V_{\theta}(F).$$ That integral looks like it can't be right, because $xe^{i\theta}$ can't vary between $0$ and $\infty$ unless $\theta = 0$. So that's puzzling too. There are two other things Newman mentions soon afterward that I don't fully understand: first, he says that $F$ drops off like $\frac{1}{x^2}$ as it approaches $\infty$. Is he talking about the real part of $F$ for $F$ with a real variable plugged in? If so, how does he get that asymptote? And second, he mentions the formula $V_{\theta}(F) = \int_{0}^{\infty}|F'(xe^{i\theta})|$ which, because I'm not sure about this whole ray thing, it's difficult to see how to derive. If anyone is familiar with this work of Newman's, I'd appreciate help with these questions.

9,Gaussian integral over a wedge of the complex plane,Gaussian integral over a wedge of the complex plane,,"I'm trying to evaluate, if it is possible, a Gaussian integral over a wedge of the complex plane $$ I = \int_W d^2z \,e^{-|z|^2 + z^*a + za^*},  $$ ($d^2z = \frac{dz\,dz^*}{2} = dx\,dy = r\,dr\,d\phi$) where $W=\{z\mid -\theta \le \arg(z) \le \theta\}$, with $\theta < \pi/2$. In other words, the integral can also be written $$ I = \int_{-\theta}^\theta d\phi \int_0^\infty dr \,r e^{-r^2 + e^{-i\phi}r a + e^{i\phi}ra^*}.  $$ In the case where $W$ is instead the entire complex plane, the answer is well known and equal to $I=\pi e^{|a|^2}$. Attempt at solution I made an attempt using Green's theorem to turn $I$ into a contour integral, and I was hoping to continue with Cauchy's integral formula from there, but got stuck due to a non-analytic function in the contour integral. I'm not sure if this is a good path forward, but I'll show you what I did. My complex integration knowledge is rusty so be aware of mistakes. First, assume that we have a complex function $f(z)$ that can be written $f(z) = f(z,z^*) = \partial_{z^*} F(z,z^*)$. Then Green's theorem gives $$ \int_W d^2 z\, f(z) = \int_W \frac{dz \, dz^*}{2} \partial_z^* F(z,z^*) = \int_W dx\,dy\, (\partial_x + i\partial_y)F = \frac{1}{2} \int_{\partial W} F \,dy - iF\,dx \\ = -\frac{i}{2} \int_{\partial W} F(z)\,dz, $$ where the last integral is a counter-clockwise contour integral over the boundary $\partial W$ of $W$. Here I used that $\partial_z^* = (\partial_x + i\partial_y)/2$ and Green's theorem $\int_S dx\,dy\,(\partial_x L + \partial_y M) = \int_{\partial S} M \,dx - L \,dy$. Returning to the integral $I$ above we have $f(z) = e^{-|z|^2 + z^*a + za^*} = \partial_{z^*} F(z,z^*)$ with $$ F(z,z^*) = \frac{e^{-|z|^2 + z^*a + za^*}}{a-z} = \frac{f(z)}{a-z}. $$ Now, it is tempting at this stage to use Cauchy's integral formula $\int_{\partial W} dz \,\frac{g(z)}{z-a} = 2\pi i g(a)$ for holomorphic (i.e. analytic) $g(z)$. However this does not work because $f(z)$ above is not holomorphic due to the $|z|^2$ and $z^*$ terms in the exponent. Writing out the contour integral over the wedge $\partial W$ explicitly we have $$ \int_{\partial W} F(z) \, dz = \int_{\partial W} dz \,\frac{e^{-|z|^2 + z^*a + za^*}}{a-z} \\ = \int_{0}^\infty dr \,\frac{e^{-r^2 + r \left(e^{-i\theta} a + e^{i\theta} a^*\right)}}{a-e^{-i\theta}r} + \int_\infty^0 dr\, \frac{e^{-r^2 + r \left(e^{i\theta} a + e^{-i\theta} a^*\right)}}{a-e^{i\theta}r} + 0 $$ Here I have divided the contour into three parts. One where $\arg(z) = -\theta$, one where $\arg(z) = \theta$, and the ""arc"" out at infinity which vanishes due to the $-|z|^2$ term in the exponent. I wasn't able to make any further progress on the integrals over $r$ above. Perhaps there is a way to evaluate them directly, or perhaps one can come up with an analytic function $g(z)$ that is equal to $f(z)$ on the contour and use Cauchy's integral formula?","I'm trying to evaluate, if it is possible, a Gaussian integral over a wedge of the complex plane $$ I = \int_W d^2z \,e^{-|z|^2 + z^*a + za^*},  $$ ($d^2z = \frac{dz\,dz^*}{2} = dx\,dy = r\,dr\,d\phi$) where $W=\{z\mid -\theta \le \arg(z) \le \theta\}$, with $\theta < \pi/2$. In other words, the integral can also be written $$ I = \int_{-\theta}^\theta d\phi \int_0^\infty dr \,r e^{-r^2 + e^{-i\phi}r a + e^{i\phi}ra^*}.  $$ In the case where $W$ is instead the entire complex plane, the answer is well known and equal to $I=\pi e^{|a|^2}$. Attempt at solution I made an attempt using Green's theorem to turn $I$ into a contour integral, and I was hoping to continue with Cauchy's integral formula from there, but got stuck due to a non-analytic function in the contour integral. I'm not sure if this is a good path forward, but I'll show you what I did. My complex integration knowledge is rusty so be aware of mistakes. First, assume that we have a complex function $f(z)$ that can be written $f(z) = f(z,z^*) = \partial_{z^*} F(z,z^*)$. Then Green's theorem gives $$ \int_W d^2 z\, f(z) = \int_W \frac{dz \, dz^*}{2} \partial_z^* F(z,z^*) = \int_W dx\,dy\, (\partial_x + i\partial_y)F = \frac{1}{2} \int_{\partial W} F \,dy - iF\,dx \\ = -\frac{i}{2} \int_{\partial W} F(z)\,dz, $$ where the last integral is a counter-clockwise contour integral over the boundary $\partial W$ of $W$. Here I used that $\partial_z^* = (\partial_x + i\partial_y)/2$ and Green's theorem $\int_S dx\,dy\,(\partial_x L + \partial_y M) = \int_{\partial S} M \,dx - L \,dy$. Returning to the integral $I$ above we have $f(z) = e^{-|z|^2 + z^*a + za^*} = \partial_{z^*} F(z,z^*)$ with $$ F(z,z^*) = \frac{e^{-|z|^2 + z^*a + za^*}}{a-z} = \frac{f(z)}{a-z}. $$ Now, it is tempting at this stage to use Cauchy's integral formula $\int_{\partial W} dz \,\frac{g(z)}{z-a} = 2\pi i g(a)$ for holomorphic (i.e. analytic) $g(z)$. However this does not work because $f(z)$ above is not holomorphic due to the $|z|^2$ and $z^*$ terms in the exponent. Writing out the contour integral over the wedge $\partial W$ explicitly we have $$ \int_{\partial W} F(z) \, dz = \int_{\partial W} dz \,\frac{e^{-|z|^2 + z^*a + za^*}}{a-z} \\ = \int_{0}^\infty dr \,\frac{e^{-r^2 + r \left(e^{-i\theta} a + e^{i\theta} a^*\right)}}{a-e^{-i\theta}r} + \int_\infty^0 dr\, \frac{e^{-r^2 + r \left(e^{i\theta} a + e^{-i\theta} a^*\right)}}{a-e^{i\theta}r} + 0 $$ Here I have divided the contour into three parts. One where $\arg(z) = -\theta$, one where $\arg(z) = \theta$, and the ""arc"" out at infinity which vanishes due to the $-|z|^2$ term in the exponent. I wasn't able to make any further progress on the integrals over $r$ above.

It's due to the fact that holomorphic functions satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations, i.e. $$\frac{\partial}{\partial x}u(x,y)=\frac{\partial}{\partial y}v(x,y),$$ $$\frac{\partial}{\partial y}u(x,y)=-\frac{\partial}{\partial x}v(x,y).$$ In 2 dimensions we have $$\mathrm{curl}\overrightarrow{F}=-\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial y}u(x,y)+\frac{\partial}{\partial x}v(x,y)\right)\overrightarrow{k}=0,$$ $$\mathrm{div}\overrightarrow{F}=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}u(x,y)-\frac{\partial}{\partial y}v(x,y)=0,$$ where $\overrightarrow{k}=(0,0,1)^T.$ Means that $\overrightarrow{F}$ is both irrotational and solenoidal.

Would this work?: $\gamma(t)=te^{i/t}$ if $0<t\le 1$, and $\gamma(0)=0$ My idea is you can always choose a point between the arcs, so that the curve travels a fixed $k$ times counterclockwise around the point. But I don't know how to choose these points formally. This is a fine example or is there something easier?",,['complex-analysis']

Question : We are given $f(z)=2z-\sinh (z)$ defined on the circle $|z|=1$. Our goal is to calculate $\int_{|z|=1}\frac{1}{f(z)}dz$ What I did : The first thing we need to take care of is finding how many roots does $f(z)$ have in the given domain. If we can prove that $|2z-f(z)| \leq |2z|$ in the circle then from Rouche's theorem they have the same number of roots, and we know that $2z$ has a root only at $z=0$. Here I also used a known inequality: $|\sinh(z)| \leq |z| \cosh (|z|)$: $|2z-f(z)|=|\sinh(z)|\leq |z|\cosh(|z|=\cosh(1)=\frac{e+e^{-1}}{2}<2=|2z|$ in the circle. We proved the inequality, so from rouche's theorem, $f(z)$ has only $1$ root in the circle, and we can see that $f(0)=0$ is the only root, and $f'(0) \neq 0$ so the ""rank"" of the root is $1$. We can use taylor series to separate $f$ to a function with roots multiplied by a function without roots (in the circle ofcourse): $$f(z)=2z-\sinh(z)=2z-\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{z^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}=z(2-\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{z^{2n}}{(2n+1)!})=z(1-\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{z^{2n}}{(2n+1)!})$$ Let $\psi(z)=1-\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{z^{2n}}{(2n+1)!}$, so overall we have $f(z)=z\psi(z)$ Notice that $\psi(0)=1$ (that's the residue) and that $\psi$ has no roots in $|z|=1$ (otherwise, $f(z)$ would have had more roots, and we already showed that $0$ is its only root). So to calculate the integral: $$\int_{|z|=1} \frac{1}{f(z)}dz=\int_{|z|=1} \frac{1}{z}\frac{1}{\psi(z)}dz=\frac{2i\pi}{\psi(0)}=2i\pi$$ from residue theorem.

97,Real analytic function with radius of convergence 1 at non-negative integers,Real analytic function with radius of convergence 1 at non-negative integers,,"So, as the title states, the problem I was confronted with was to find a real-valued everywhere analytic function $$f:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$$ s.t. at every non-negative integer, k $$f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}{a_n(x-k)}$$ locally and the radius of convergence of this power series is exactly one. I constructed what seems to me to be theoretically an interesting function, and I'm not sure if this was the conventional answer to the problem (though it probably is). I constructed the function: $$f(x):=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}{\frac {1}{x^2-2kx+k^2+1}\cdot \frac {1} {2^k}}= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}{\frac {1}{(x-k)^2+1}\cdot \frac {1} {2^k}}$$ The first thing you can notice is that computationally it may be better in some circumstances to use a nicer scaling factor than the 1/2^k in order to calculate numerical approximations since this function approaches $0$ very quickly away from the origin. Mathematica seems to support my intuition that this function has poles at $k+i$ and $k-i$ for all non-negative integers $k$. (I recommend people play around with this function numerically or analytically in Mathematica as its quite fun) And also, we can conclude it must since it converges uniformly by the M-test to an analytic function on $\mathbb R$ (since each partial sum is analytic, at least on compact subsets not containing the poles). (Is this correct reasoning?) Can we conclude that this function actually converges everywhere to a meromorphic function on $\mathbb C$? Finally, my last question on this topic is if there is a way to tackle this problem assuming less or no complex analysis knowledge at all? This was a problem in my real analysis class and I feel like we weren't expected to know this complex information about radii of convergence. (I don't think he taught us this) Please let me know of any errors in my post that I should correct. Any other thinking on this topic is happily welcomed as well. Thanks. :) NOTE: According to Mathematica it seems you can construct this same sum without scaling each subsequent rational function down. Why does this converge and how can we be sure?
