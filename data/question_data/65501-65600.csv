The solution from my answer key puts the count at 502,860; however, I have an argument for why this number is too high.  Please help me understand where my logic is flawed. Instead of coming up with an exact answer for the number of ace high hands I will show an upper bound on the number of ace high hands.  First, go through the card deck and remove all four aces leaving a deck of 48 cards.  We will use this 48 card deck to form the four card ""non ace"" part of the ""ace high"" hand.  First, how many ways are there to form any four card hand from a 48 card deck?  This is (48 choose 4) = 194,580.  Now, not all of these hands when paired with an ace will form an ""ace high"" hand. For example A Q Q K K would be two pair.  In fact, any four card hand with at least two cards of the same rank (e.g. Queen of Spades, Queen of Hearts) will not generate an ace high hand.  So let's find the number of such hands and subtract them from 194,580. I believe the number of such hands can be found by first selecting a rank for a pair from these 48 remaining cards, that is, (12 choose 1)--times the number of ways to select two suits for our rank (4 choose 2)--times the number of ways to pick the remaining 2 required cards from 46 remaining cards, that is, (46 choose 2).  So, restated, given our 48 card deck we can create a four card hand that contains at least one pair this many ways: (12 choose 1)(4 choose 2)    (46 choose 2) = 74,520 [pair rank]  [suits of pair] [remaining 2 cards] Thus the number of four card hands that do not include at least one pair is: (48 choose 4) - 74,520 = 120,060 We can pair each of these four card sets with one of our four aces to form the number of five card hands that contain an ace, but not any single pair (or better).

In how many ways can they sign up to courses $A, B, C$ if each of the students can choose either $0$ , $1$ , $2$ or $3$ courses and also (*) none of the $7$ parts of Venn Diagram visualizing the problem are empty. My solution: I assumed that (*) is equivalent to simply having to subtract the number of possibilities where students didn't choose certain courses and I'll use that fact later in the solution. Let's first count the total number of ways students can sign up to the courses. Let's consider a single student. If they choose to sign up to $0$ courses, they have $1$ possibility $=$ choosing $0$ courses. If they choose to sign up to $1$ course, they have $3$ posibilites $=$ $A$ or $B$ or $C$ . If they choose to sign up to $2$ courses, they have $3$ possibilities $=$ not choosing $A$ or $B$ or $C$ . If they choose to sign up to $3$ courses, they have $1$ possibility $=$ choosing $A$ and $B$ and $C$ . So there are $8$ options in total and since there are $n$ students, there are $8^n$ total possibilities. Next step: we have to subtract the number of possibilities where students leave parts of the Venn Diagram empty. We're gonna use the inclusion-exclusion principle to calculate them. More precisely, we need to calculate $$|A'\cup B'\cup C'| = |A'| + |B'| + |C'| - |A'\cap B'| - |A'\cap C'| - |B'\cap C'| + |A'\cap B'\cap C'|$$ where $|A'\cup B'\cup C'|$ represents the total number of ways in which we can achieve an empty part in the Venn Diagramm and for example $|A'|$ is the total number of ways in which no student chose the course $A$ . Let's do something similar as in the beginning: what is the total number of ways $|A'|$ in which no student chose course $A$ ? Let's consider a single student. If they choose to sign up to $0$ courses, they have $1$ possibility. If they choose to sign up to $1$ course, they have $2$ posibilites $=$ choosing $B$ or $C$ . If they choose to sign up to $2$ courses, they have $1$ possibility $=$ choosing $B$ and $C$ . If they choose to sign up to $3$ courses, they have $0$ possibilities. So in total, a single student has $4$ ways not to choose course $A$ and since there are $n$ students, there are $4^n$ ways to do so. This number is obviously the same for courses $B$ and $C$ . So $|A'| = |B'| = |C'| = 4^n$ . Calculating the number of possibilities where no student chooses courses $A \cup B$ is very similar. The result I got is $2^n$ and $|A' \cup B'| = |A' \cup C'| = |B' \cup C'| = 2^n$ The number of ways in which every student can choose $0$ courses is just $1$ . Now, plugging in the numbers $|A'\cup B'\cup C'| = 3*4^n - 3*2^n + 1$ , leaving the total answer equal to $$8^n - 3*4^n + 3*2^n - 1$$ I was told that my solution is far off.

Let a positive integer be written in binary numeral system. We shall say that a some digit of the is interesting if this digit is not equal to the adjacent digit to the right of it and if this digit is not equal adjacent digit to the left of it (The first digit is interesting if it is not equal to the second digit. The last digit is interesting if it is not equal to the penultimate digit). Let be the number of interesting digits of . If then we shall say that the positive integer is beautiful. Let be the number of beautiful positive integers in the set . Prove that is divisible by . My work . Using a computer program, I found that . Below I wrote all the beautiful positive integers in binary numeral system. But I need to have a mathematical solution of the problem. 111110101010101010101, 111011010101010101010, 111010110101010101010, 111010101101010101010, 111010101011010101010, 111010101010110101010,

99,Finding counterfeit coins,Finding counterfeit coins,,"Suppose I have $N$ rare coins, of which $M \le N$ are counterfeits. I am blind. I ask an oracle who charges me a penny to tell me in yes/no answers whether there is a counterfeit in any group I show her. Is there a strategy to identify all $M$ coins with minimal cost, preferably something better than $O(N)$ ? This sounds like a variant of the counterfeit coin problem but I cannot find a good solution. EDIT: In the case of $M=1$ , one obvious solution is on order of $\log_2(N)$ where you number each coin in order, in base $2$ . Then test each group by digits wherever the coin has a 1 in that digit. Then the counterfeit should be identified by the oracle readout per digit, in base $2$ .","Suppose I have rare coins, of which are counterfeits. I am blind.
