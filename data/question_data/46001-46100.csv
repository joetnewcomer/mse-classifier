Show that $P$ is a principal ideal. I think there is a problem with my proof. So I said that if $m(x)$ is a nonzero polynomial in $P$ of minimum degree then $P=(m(x))$ . If $f(x) \in P$ is any polynomial then in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ there is $q(x),r(x) \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ such that $f(x)=q(x)m(x)+r(x) \implies r(x)=f(x)-q(x)m(x)$ with $r=0$ or the degree of r less than the degree of $m$ . Letting $L$ be the LCM of the denominators of the coefficients we have $Lr(x)=Lf(x)-Lq(x)m(x) \implies Lr(x) \in P$ . This is where the problem is. I want to claim that $Lr(x) \in P \implies L\in P$ or $r(x) \in P$ . Obviously this then forces $r(x) \in P$ by the intersection assumption which then forces $r=0$ . The problem is that $r(x)$ is not necessarily in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ so the prime condition on $P$ does not necessarily apply here.

Then we know that $P_3$ is also normal, and so $G \cong \Bbb{Z}_7 \times \Bbb{Z}_3$ . Case 2: Let $n_3=7$ . We have $\alpha : \Bbb{Z}_3 \rightarrow \Bbb{Z}_7^{\times} \cong \Bbb{Z}_6$ So the generator $a$ of $\Bbb{Z}_3$ needs to be sent to an element of order 3 in $\Bbb{Z}_6$ , which means that it needs to be sent to either $2$ or $4$ .

Question 1 I know that given $A; B$ subgroups of an Abelian group $G$ , then if $A \cong B$ , then it's not necessarily true that $R/A \cong R/B$ (I can find a counter example of this). But is the reverse true? Like if $R/A \cong R/B$ then is true that $A \cong B$ ? I think that it's false, but I cannot find a counter example of it. :( And moreover, how can I find counter examples of the above 2 statements in quotient rings? I've been searching for a counter example in common rings, like $\mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{Z}[x]$ but with no luck. Question 2 So basically, I understand that, if you are trying to prove something of the line $X/X' \cong Y/Y'$ , then showing that $X\cong X'$ , and $Y \cong Y'$ is definitely not enough. Ok, here's my second question. Given a ses of $R-$ modules $0 \to M \xrightarrow{f} P \xrightarrow{g} X \to 0$ , where $P$ is projective, and an $R-$ module $Y$ . Here's a proof of $\mbox{Ext}^1 (X;Y) \cong \mbox{Hom}(M;Y)/\mbox{Im}(\mbox{Hom}(f;1_Y))$ , that I don't really understand. Firstly, construct a projective solution for $M$ , i.e: $$... \xrightarrow{\delta_2} P_1 \xrightarrow{\delta_1} P_0 \xrightarrow{\delta_0} M \to 0$$ Then, we can connect the above les with the ses as given to arrive at a projective resolution for $X$ as follow. $$... \xrightarrow{\delta_2} P_1 \xrightarrow{\delta_1} P_0 \xrightarrow{f\delta_0} P \xrightarrow{g} X \to 0$$ Now, drop the $X$ to obtain the following complex: $$... \xrightarrow{\delta_2} P_1 \xrightarrow{\delta_1} P_0 \xrightarrow{f\delta_0} P \to 0$$ Apply $\mbox{Hom}(-; Y)$ to the above complex to have yet another complex: $$... \xleftarrow{\mbox{Hom}(\delta_2; 1_Y)} \mbox{Hom}(P_1; Y) \xleftarrow{\mbox{Hom}(\delta_1; 1_Y)} \mbox{Hom}(P_0; Y) \xleftarrow{\mbox{Hom}(f\delta_0; 1_Y)} \mbox{Hom}(P; Y) \leftarrow 0$$ Now by definition, we have: $\mbox{Ext}^1(X;Y) = \mbox{ker} \ \mbox{Hom}(\delta_1; 1_Y) / \mbox{im} \ \mbox{Hom}(f \delta_0; 1_Y)$ (*) Now, we'll try to express $\mbox{ker} \ \mbox{Hom}(\delta_1; 1_Y)$ in other terms. Since $P_1 \xrightarrow{\delta_1} P_0 \xrightarrow{\delta_0} M \to 0$ is exact, apply $\mbox{Hom} (-; Y)$ to this sequence, to have an exact sequence: $\mbox{Hom}(P_1; Y)\xleftarrow{\mbox{Hom}(\delta_1; 1_Y)} \mbox{Hom}(P_0; Y) \xleftarrow{\mbox{Hom}(\delta_0; 1_Y)} \mbox{Hom}(M; Y) \leftarrow 0$ , which means that: $\mbox{ker} \ \mbox{Hom}(\delta_1; 1_Y) = \mbox{im} \ \mbox{Hom}(\delta_0; 1_Y) \cong \mbox{Hom} (M; Y)$ (since $\mbox{Hom}(\delta_0; 1_Y)$ is injective). And $\mbox{im} \ \mbox{Hom}(f \delta_0; 1_Y) = \mbox{Hom}(\delta_0; 1_Y)\left( \mbox{Hom}(f; 1_Y)(\mbox{Hom}(P; Y))\right) \cong \mbox{Im} \ \mbox{Hom}(f; 1_Y)$ (since $\mbox{Hom}(\delta_0; 1_Y)$ is injective). And then, the author just kind of plug everything in (*) , to have: $$\mbox{Ext}^1(X;Y) = \mbox{ker} \ \mbox{Hom}(\delta_1; 1_Y) / \mbox{im} \ \mbox{Hom}(f \delta_0; 1_Y) \cong \mbox{Hom} (M; Y) / \mbox{Im} \ \mbox{Hom}(f; 1_Y)$$ This proof doesn't look good to me, since AFAIK we cannot prove isormorphicity of quotient modules like that.
