If $(X,\tau)$ is compact and $(Y,\tau_1)$ is Hausdorff, prove that $f$ is a homeomorphism.

Proof : If $A\subset X$ is compact than it is closed in $(X,\tau)$ . Then if $\{a_n:n\in\mathbb{N}\}$ is an arbitrary sequence in A then by the compactness there is a subsequence that converges in A such that $\lim_{n\to\infty}a_{in}=a$ where $a \in A$ . By continuity of $f$ , $\lim_{n\to\infty} f(a_{in})=f(a)$ so that $f(a)\in f(A)$ . So $f(A)$ is compact since the space $(Y,\tau_1)$ is compact then $f(A)$ is closed. So $f$ is a closed mapping. In the Exercise the function is continuous so if $B\in\tau_1$ then $f^{-1}(B)\in\tau$ , now it is left to show that $f$ send open sets to open sets. This is where my problem begins: Compactness is going to be preserved by continuity of $f$ , then $(Y,\tau_1)$ must be compact as every image of a subset of $(X,\tau)$ that would imply that $f$ is a closed mapping by the Lemma.

19,Is addition continuous?,Is addition continuous?,,"I'm going to ask a very silly question, so I'm begging you to be understanding if it is absolutely trivial, or if it's an exercise in some Bourbaki. I'm afraid of asking you, because the question entails this particular case: is the addition of (a finite, but variable quantity of) real numbers a continuous function? Ok, let me try to explain what I mean. I'm insisting in doing exercices about topological groups, see if I can understand something about those previous question 1 , question 2 and question 3 . This one should be more elementary. Let $G$ be a topological Abelian group, written additively, and let $I$ be an arbitrary set. I don't mind if you take $G = \mathbb{R}$, with the usual Euclidian topology and the usual addition of real numbers, but you cannot assume $I$ is finite, nor countable. Let $$ G^I = \prod G = \prod_\alpha G_\alpha , \qquad \text{where}\ G_\alpha = G \qquad \text{for all}\ \alpha \in I \ . $$ Let us denote  $(x_\alpha)$ the elements of $\prod G$. This is an Abelian topological group with the usual product topology and operations defined component-wise: $$ \begin{align} (x_\alpha) + (y_\alpha) &= (x_\alpha + y_\alpha)  \\\ -(x_\alpha)              &= (-x_\alpha) \end{align} $$ Consider also the weak product $\prod' G$ (aka, direct sum ). That is, elements of $\prod' G$ are those tuples $(x_\alpha) \in \prod  G$ such that $x_\alpha = 0$, except for a finite number of indexes $\alpha \in I$. $\prod'G $ is of course a subgroup of $\prod G$, $\prod' G \subset \prod G$. Let's consider the subspace topology on $\prod' G$, induced from the product topology on $\prod G$. Then we have a well-defined addition map that we hadn't in $\prod G$: $$ \sum : \prod ' G \longrightarrow G \ , \qquad  (x_\alpha ) \mapsto \sum_\alpha x_\alpha \ . $$ This makes sense, despite the fact $I$ is not necessarily an ordered set because, given an element $(x_\alpha) \in \prod'G$, if $x_{\alpha_1}, \dots , x_{\alpha_n}$ are its non-zero components, we don't have a canonical choice in order to perform the addition $x_{\alpha_1} + \cdots + x_{\alpha_n}$. Nevertheless, since the sum is associative and commutative, we may do it as we please: the result will always be the same. Hence $\sum_\alpha x_\alpha$ is well-defined. Question. Is this map $\sum$ continuous? That is, if you don't like too much abstraction in your life, but prefer to be very specific: is the sum of real numbers $$ \sum: \prod' \mathbb{R} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R} \ , \qquad (x_\alpha) \mapsto \sum_\alpha x_\alpha $$ continuous? Remark 1. The question seems silly, doesn't it? Well, maybe it is, but the first answer that came to my mind is wrong, as far as I can see: you cannot say ""this $\sum$ is continuous because it is a composition of continuous maps""; namely, the iteration of the addition of $G$. Yeah, but: which composition? Notice that there is no canonical choice for doing the addition in an specific order -there could be no order at all in $I$. So every time you compute $\sum_\alpha x_\alpha$ you can change the order in which you perform the (continuous) sums $x_\alpha + x_\beta$.

29,Braid groups and the fundamental group of the configuration space of $n$ points,Braid groups and the fundamental group of the configuration space of  points,n,"I am giving a lecture on Braid Groups this month at a seminar and I am confused about how to understand the fundamental group of the configuration space of $n$ points, so I will define some terminology which I will be referring to and then ask a few questions. The configuration space of $n$ points on the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$ is: $$C_{o,\hat{n}}(\mathbb{C})=\{(z_{1},...,z_{n}) \in \mathbb{C} \times \cdot \cdot \cdot \times \mathbb{C} \text{ | } z_{i} \neq z_{j} \text{ if } i \neq j\}$$ A point on $C_{o,\hat{n}}$ is denoted by a vector $\vec{z} = (z_{1},...,z_{n})$. The group action $S_{n} \times C_{o,\hat{n}}(\mathbb{C}) \rightarrow C_{o,\hat{n}}(\mathbb{C})$ has the property that $\forall \vec{z} \in C_{o,\hat{n}}(\mathbb{C})$, $\sigma\vec{z}=\vec{z}$ implies $\sigma = e$, where $\sigma \in S_{n}$ and $e$ is the identity permutation. Thus,  the symmetric group acts freely on $C_{o,\hat{n}}$, permuting the coordinates in each $\vec{z} \in C_{o,\hat{n}}$. According to the notes I am reading, the orbit space $S_{n}(\vec{z})=\{\sigma\vec{z} \text{ | } \sigma \in S_{n}\}$ with $\vec{z} \in C_{o,\hat{n}}(\mathbb{C})$ is equivalent to the configuration space modulo the permutation group. That is, $$C_{o,n} = S_{n}(\vec{z}) = C_{o,\hat{n}}(\mathbb{C})\Big/\Sigma_{n}$$ is the orbit space of the group action and we let $\tau: C_{o,\hat{n}} \rightarrow C_{o,n}$ be the orbit space projection. Then, letting $\vec{p}=(p_{1},...,p_{n})$ be a fixed base point, we define the pure braid group $\textbf{P}_{n}$ on $n$ strands and the braid group $\textbf{B}_{n}$ on $n$ strands to be the following fundamental groups, respectively. $$\textbf{P}_{n} = \pi_{1}(C_{o,\hat{n}},\vec{p})$$ $$\textbf{B}_{n} = \pi_{1}(C_{o,n},\tau(\vec{p}))$$ EDIT: I have been able to answer some of my own questions recently by further thinking and research but I have one remaining question. We place a base point $\vec{p} = (p_{1},...,p_{n})$ in our configuration space $C_{o,\hat{n}}$ and then we want to consider loops in configuration space. I can visualize how if we place our base point as a configuration of collinear points that we obtain a braid on $n$ strands, but I am not sure why there is a non-trivial loop. My understanding of homotopy is that if there is no ""hole"" in the space, then we can continuously retract our loop in $C_{o,\hat{n}}$ back to our base point $\vec{p}$. Why can we not do this in this case?","I am giving a lecture on Braid Groups this month at a seminar and I am confused about how to understand the fundamental group of the configuration space of $n$ points, so I will define some terminology which I will be referring to and then ask a few questions. The configuration space of $n$ points on the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$ is: $$C_{o,\hat{n}}(\mathbb{C})=\{(z_{1},...,z_{n}) \in \mathbb{C} \times \cdot \cdot \cdot \times \mathbb{C} \text{ | } z_{i} \neq z_{j} \text{ if } i \neq j\}$$ A point on $C_{o,\hat{n}}$ is denoted by a vector $\vec{z} = (z_{1},...,z_{n})$. The group action $S_{n} \times C_{o,\hat{n}}(\mathbb{C}) \rightarrow C_{o,\hat{n}}(\mathbb{C})$ has the property that $\forall \vec{z} \in C_{o,\hat{n}}(\mathbb{C})$, $\sigma\vec{z}=\vec{z}$ implies $\sigma = e$, where $\sigma \in S_{n}$ and $e$ is the identity permutation. Thus,  the symmetric group acts freely on $C_{o,\hat{n}}$, permuting the coordinates in each $\vec{z} \in C_{o,\hat{n}}$. According to the notes I am reading, the orbit space $S_{n}(\vec{z})=\{\sigma\vec{z} \text{ | } \sigma \in S_{n}\}$ with $\vec{z} \in C_{o,\hat{n}}(\mathbb{C})$ is equivalent to the configuration space modulo the permutation group. That is, $$C_{o,n} = S_{n}(\vec{z}) = C_{o,\hat{n}}(\mathbb{C})\Big/\Sigma_{n}$$ is the orbit space of the group action and we let $\tau: C_{o,\hat{n}} \rightarrow C_{o,n}$ be the orbit space projection. Then, letting $\vec{p}=(p_{1},...,p_{n})$ be a fixed base point, we define the pure braid group $\textbf{P}_{n}$ on $n$ strands and the braid group $\textbf{B}_{n}$ on $n$ strands to be the following fundamental groups, respectively. $$\textbf{P}_{n} = \pi_{1}(C_{o,\hat{n}},\vec{p})$$ $$\textbf{B}_{n} = \pi_{1}(C_{o,n},\tau(\vec{p}))$$ EDIT: I have been able to answer some of my own questions recently by further thinking and research but I have one remaining question. We place a base point $\vec{p} = (p_{1},...,p_{n})$ in our configuration space $C_{o,\hat{n}}$ and then we want to consider loops in configuration space. I can visualize how if we place our base point as a configuration of collinear points that we obtain a braid on $n$ strands, but I am not sure why there is a non-trivial loop.

31,variant on Sierpinski carpet: rescue the tablecloth!,variant on Sierpinski carpet: rescue the tablecloth!,,"I was playing around with Sierpinski carpets (see pretty GPU-produced picture here ), and came up with a variation that I have been unable to find mentioned elsewhere. I'm wondering if anyone can tell me an existing name for it, and help me determine where it fits into existing classifications of fractals. As you probably know, The construction of the Sierpinski   carpet begins with a square. The   square is cut into 9 congruent   subsquares in a 3-by-3 grid, and the   [open] central subsquare is removed. The same   procedure is then applied recursively   to the remaining 8 subsquares, ad   infinitum. In this variation, instead of merely removing the central subsquare, we recursively apply the same procedure to it ""inversely."" (Is there a better term for that?) That is, we treat the central hole as if we want to replace it with the complement of [this variant of] a Sierpinski carpet. So when we recur on the central hole, we put an ""anti-hole"" (like a ""donut hole"" without a donut) in the middle of it. We will then recur on the anti-hole using the normal (positive) procedure, and recur on the 8 subsquares surrounding the anti-hole using the inverse procedure. It looks something like this, in its 5th iteration: If you think I should post the code for this, I'm happy to, but I didn't think it was very relevant to the math question. I've been calling it ""Sierpinski tablecloth"" since I couldn't find another name for it, and because it reminds me of a lace or crocheted tablecloth design. Correction: @Rahul pointed out that ""the limiting set of the recursive process does not exist."" This is because the central point of the unit square must be part of both the tablecloth and its complement, or neither - which is impossible. (Of course we can still do finite iterations of the constructive process without hitting a contradiction.) To fix this problem, I tried proposing that we define the tablecloth set T (arbitrarily) to include the central point. The central subsquare is replaced with the union of the central point with the scaled-down complement of T. As before, the subsquares around the center are replaced with scaled-down copies of T (and therefore the central point of each of the subsquares is contained in T). Another update: Unfortunately the same problem is true of any point with an irrational coordinate, and of many rational ones. If we express the coordinates in base 3, as with the Cantor set, a point is a member of T iff the number of 1's in the base-3 expansion of each of its coordinates is even. But this doesn't work for numbers with repeating 1's. If we tried to fix this by making all ""problem points"" belong to T, we'd be left with ""almost"" a solid unit square, minus a ""dust"" of rational points with an even number of 1's in their base-3 coordinate expansions. Then T would cease to generate interesting fractal pictures (in the limit). Its area would be 1, like the irrationals$^2$. It's not clear to me that T would be different from the set of the irrationals$^2$ in any interesting way. Mind you, we can still draw pictures of the nth iteration of the tablecloth that are fun to look at, but it loses a good deal of its bite if it doesn't exist as a fractal. Can you think of a way to save the tablecloth from extinction as a fractal? The rest of this question was written under the misapprehension that the tablecloth exists (is a well-defined set) in the limit. Fractal dimension The traditional carpet has Hausdorff dimension $log(8)/log(3) = ~1.8928$ derived from the fact that it takes 8 self-similar copies at reduction factor 1/3 to cover itself (see example for Sierpinski triangle ). In this vein I figure that the tablecloth takes 9 self-similar copies at reduction factor 1/3 to cover itself (no smaller copy will cover the middle mini-square), so it would have Hausdorff dimension $log(9)/log(3) = 2$ This would put it in the same company (in terms of Hausdorff dimension) as space-filling curves like the Sierpinski curve, Hilbert, Peano, etc. Does this sound reasonable so far? I'm not quite comfortable with that, though, because a 1/3-size copy of the tablecloth will not actually cover the whole middle subsquare. In fact I can't see how any finite number of reduced-size copies of the tablecloth would cover the whole middle subsquare. And if we say we need an infinite number, the Hausdorff dimension would be infinite. :-( As an alternative, I considered multifractals , since we seem to have different scaling behavior occurring in different parts of the attractor. But that's deeper water than I'm prepared to wade into. Can anyone point me to literature on fractals that are defined using complements of reduced-size self-similar sets (as well as the usual reduced-size self-similar sets)? Is that a class of fractals that has been studied? (Update:) Or are such ""fractals"" doomed to be ill-defined (self-contradictory) by their nature? Similarly to Hausdorff dimension, the box-counting dimension (using the criterion ""if the space were divided up into a grid of boxes of size ε, how many boxes of that scale would contain part of the attractor?"") also seems to end up at 2, for much the same reasons. And I'm more comfortable with it because a ""box"" (as opposed to a reduced copy of the tablecloth) will indeed cover the whole middle subsquare. It seems clear that in the limit, the box-counting dimension converges to 2, because there are no gaps, so every box, at whatever size ε, will always contain part of the fractal. In terms of area (standard Lebesgue measure ), I'm pretty sure that the tablecloth has zero, like the carpet, because it has no intervals (rectangles) that are entirely in the set. Right? ( Update: I stand corrected: the tablecloth seems to have area 1/2.) Summary There are several questions above, so to tie them all together: I'm wondering if this tablecloth variant is something new and interesting, or something well-known, or an unknown but trivial variant that can be classified under existing categories. E.g. if there is a variant of the Cantor set that is defined similarly to the tablecloth (for one dimension), I would appreciate a link to info about that. (Update:) One thing that seems interesting to me about it is that it has points in every interval of the unit square, but it also has holes in every interval. I guess it's like rational numbers in [0,1] in that regard, or like space-filling curves/trees, yet is not a curve or tree (not connected). I can't think of other fractals off-hand that are like that, can you? It seems that this property is connected with the fact that we recur on the inverse instead of leaving holes. P.S. I just read about the term mutually dense ( Interleaving Ad Infinitum ): 'If a set S with linear ordering O can be partitioned into two subsets A and B such that between every two distinct elements of A is an  element of B, and vice versa, then the sets A and B are said to be  ""mutually dense"".' So the tablecloth and its complement are mutually dense, assuming that this term can be generalized to the unit square.

I got the feeling we might need some help from a real topologist . Let me repeat the crucial definitions. We are dealing with curves $c:[0,1]\to\Bbb R^m$ which are assumed to be continuous maps. Definition. Given a curve $c:[a,b]\to\Bbb R^m$ and $n\in\Bbb N$, an equichordal subdivision of $c$ into $n$ segments is a sequence $t_i,i=0,...,n$ with   $$a=t_0\leq t_1\leq\cdots\leq t_{n-1}\leq t_n=b, \qquad \|c(t_{i-1})-c(t_i)\|=\Delta,\quad \text{for all $i=1,...,n$}$$   and some chord length $\Delta$. Essentially this means we are looking for $n+1$ points on a curve (including the end points) so that neighboring points all have the same Euclidean distance $\Delta$ from each other. Now the big question is: Question: Is it always possible for arbitrary curves $c$ and $n\in\Bbb N$ to equichordally subdivide $c$ into $n$ segments? It seems not so strange to assume that this might be. However, look at the following examples for $n=3$. The subdivision might not at all follow the shape of the curve or will look similar to a subdivision with equal arc lengths (for small $n$). Most of the time, for a given $n$ the final chord length $\Delta$ is pretty unpredictable. Further information for the interested reader: In one of my answers I gave a proof that felt good at first, but I cited a result incompletely. I used this statement despite some answer below gave a nice counter-example. Currently I have no idea how to justify that this is no problem. I also think that my proof might be too complicated, even though it proves a more general statement (the existence of a continuous transition from a trivial subdivision to a subdivision of the whole curve). In this answer Rahul gave a proof for the cases $n=2$ and $n=3$. He (and now me too) got the feeling that this might be generalizable by someone with enough experience in topology (homotopy maybe?). I really prefer Rahul's approach for its simplicity. He even posted a follow up question on it over here . As far as I know, there is no easy way to find such a subdivision. For sufficiently well behaved curves it might be possible to just choose some reasonable subdivision and wiggling the points a bit to bring them into the right spot for equichordality. However, this will fail in general. Also, given an equichordal subdivision of some subcurve of $c$, it is highly non-trivial to ""stretch"" it out to cover the whole curve while still keeping the desired property. I found counterexamples for most easy approaches. For example, test your procedure on the examples given above. I have not studied any possible counter-examples in higher dimensions.

Details: Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are topological spaces and $(x_n,y_n)_n$ is a sequence that is ""limit-dense"" in $X\times Y$, meaning that for every point $(x,y)\in X\times Y$, there is a subsequence $(x_m,y_m)_m$ that converges to $(x,y)$. Does that imply the following: For every point $x\in X$, there is a subsequence $(x_m,y_m)_m$ such that $(x_m)_m$ converges to $x$ and $(y_m)_m$ is limit-dense in $Y$? The answer is ""yes"" if $X$ is first-countable and $Y$ is second-countable. Those axioms give us the open rectangles that we need the subsequence to hit. But are those additional assumptions necessary? Edits: Here's a proof of the earlier claim. Suppose $X$ is first-countable and $Y$ is second-countable. Let $U_1\supset U_2\supset\cdots\ni x$ be a descending countable local basis at $x$ and let $V_i$ be a countable basis on $Y$. Define a sequence of target rectangles $(T_n)_n$ to be $(U_1\times V_1, U_2\times V_1, U_2\times V_2, U_3\times V_1, U_3\times V_2, U_3\times V_3, \ldots)$. Now recursively define the subsequence $n_k$ by $n_0=0$ and for $k\geq 1$, $n_k$ is the first value greater than $n_{k-1}$ such that $(x_{n_k}, y_{n_k})\in T_k$. Then $x_{n_k}\to x$.

Details: Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are topological spaces and $(x_n,y_n)_n$ is a sequence that is ""limit-dense"" in $X\times Y$, meaning that for every point $(x,y)\in X\times Y$, there is a subsequence $(x_m,y_m)_m$ that converges to $(x,y)$. Does that imply the following: For every point $x\in X$, there is a subsequence $(x_m,y_m)_m$ such that $(x_m)_m$ converges to $x$ and $(y_m)_m$ is limit-dense in $Y$? The answer is ""yes"" if $X$ is first-countable and $Y$ is second-countable. Those axioms give us the open rectangles that we need the subsequence to hit. But are those additional assumptions necessary? Edits: Here's a proof of the earlier claim. Suppose $X$ is first-countable and $Y$ is second-countable. Let $U_1\supset U_2\supset\cdots\ni x$ be a descending countable local basis at $x$ and let $V_i$ be a countable basis on $Y$. Define a sequence of target rectangles $(T_n)_n$ to be $(U_1\times V_1, U_2\times V_1, U_2\times V_2, U_3\times V_1, U_3\times V_2, U_3\times V_3, \ldots)$. Now recursively define the subsequence $n_k$ by $n_0=0$ and for $k\geq 1$, $n_k$ is the first value greater than $n_{k-1}$ such that $(x_{n_k}, y_{n_k})\in T_k$. Then $x_{n_k}\to x$.

How does the following look? Proof: For each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, make an open cover of $K$ by neighborhoods of radius $\frac{1}{n}$, and we have a finite subcover by compactness, i.e. $$K \subset \bigcup_{x \in K} N_{\frac{1}{n}}(x) \ \Rightarrow \ \exists x_1, ..., x_N \in K \text{ such that } K \subset \bigcup_{i=1}^{N} N_{\frac{1}{n}} (x_i)$$ Doing this for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we  get a countable union of finite collections of sets, so the collection of these sets, call it $S$, is countable. We claim that $S$ is a countable base for $K$, which is defined as a countable collection of open sets such that for any $x \in K$ and any open set $G$ with $x \in G$, there is some $V \in S$ such that $x \in V \subset G$. Let $x \in K$ and let $G$ be any open set with $x \in G$. Then since $G$ is open, there is some $r > 0$ such that $N_r(x) \subset G$. Choose $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\frac{1}{n} < \frac{r}{2}$, so that the maximal distance between points in a neighborhood of radius $\frac{1}{n}$ is $r$. Then there must be some $i$ such that $x \in N_{\frac{1}{n}}(x_i) \subset N_r(x)$ because any neighborhood of radius $\frac{1}{n}$ containing $x$ cannot contain points a distance more than $r$ away.

First, note that $E$ is clearly countable. To show that it's dense, we need to show that $\overline{E} = K$. This is equivalent to showing that $(\overline{E})^c = \emptyset$. Now $(\overline{E})^c$ is an open set because it's the complement of a closed set, $\overline{E}$. If $(\overline{E})^c$ is nonempty, then there is some $x \in (\overline{E})^c$, which is open, so since $\{V_n\}$ is a base, there is some $n$ such that $x \in V_n \subset (\overline{E})^c$, which implies that $x_n \in (\overline{E})^c$, a contradiction, because $x_n \in E \implies x_n \in \overline{E} \implies x_n \notin (\overline{E})^c$.
