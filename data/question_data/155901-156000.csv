Given that their sum is odd, there are more odd numbers than even ones, or there are an odd number of odd numbers among the majority of even numbers among $a_1, a_2, a_3$ , etc. Also, $413 = 21\times 19 + 14$ , and since it is said that all of $a_1,a_2,a_3$ , etc. aren't necessarily distinct and since one of $a_1,a_2,a_3, \dots$ is even as per the first possibility, we can say that $19\space a_i$ 's are $21$ and the only even number among the $20$ integers is $14$ . Also $lcm(21,21,21,... \text{(19 nos.)},14) = 42$ , which is thus a possible candidate worth considering. I stopped there.

After doing number crunching, I think there are no solutions. But I am unable to prove it. Attempt If $x$ and $y$ have common divisor $d$ , we have $d^3(m^3+n^3)=3^z$ . So $d$ must be a power of $3$ , and we are back to where we started. So we assume $x$ and $y$ are coprime. Testing the parity, we have sum of 2 cubes to be odd. WLOG, we can assume $x$ is even and $y$ is odd. Trying mod $3$ , we have $x+y=0 \pmod 3$ . Since $x$ and $y$ are coprime, $x$ and $y$ must be congruent to $1$ and $-1$ or vice-versa. If I assume $x=3m+1$ and $y=3n-1$ , expand out and simplify, I get $27(m^3+n^3)+27(m^2-n^2)+9(m+n)=3^z$ . If I assume $z \geq 3$ , this gives $(m^3+n^3)+(m^2-n^2)+\frac{m+n}{3}=3^{z-3}$ .

69,How do I get my math proof checked?,How do I get my math proof checked?,,"I have a math proof that I think would be in the category of number-theory or algebra. EDIT: The proof is incorrect as pointed out by Empy2 but still proves that the values must be all odd or all even. The proof is that there doesn't exist a 3x3 magic square with all squares (see https://plus.maths.org/content/os/latestnews/may-aug10/magic/index ) Edit: Here is my proof: So the basic idea is to solve variables a^2    b^2    c^2 d^2    e^2    f^2 g^2    h^2    i^2 and we know that every row/column/diagonal must add to some value.  Say s for sum.  Now let's replace h^2 with s-b^2-e^2 since we know that the row must add to s. a^2    b^2    c^2 d^2    e^2    f^2 g^2    s-b^2-e^2    i^2 Now let's replace the bottom right value i^2 with s-a^2-e^2 since that diagonal must add to s. a^2    b^2    c^2 d^2    e^2    f^2 g^2    s-b^2-e^2    s-a^2-e^2 and now the same with the bottom left: a^2    b^2    c^2 d^2    e^2    f^2 s-c^2-e^2    s-b^2-e^2    s-a^2-e^2 We can also replace d^2 with s-(s-c^2-e^2)-a^2 which can be simplified as c^2+e^2-a^2: a^2   b^2   c^2 c^2+e^2-a^2   e^2   f^2 s-c^2-e^2   s-b^2-e^2   s-a^2-e^2 Let's also replace the middle-right f^2 with s-(s-a^2-e^2)-c^2 which is a^2+e^2-c^2. a^2   b^2   c^2 c^2+e^2-a^2   e^2   a^2+e^2-c^2 s-c^2-e^2   s-b^2-e^2   s-a^2-e^2 We also know that the middle row must add to s therefore (c^2+e^2-a^2)+e^2+(a^2+e^2-c^2)=s.  Which can be simplifyed as 3e^2=s.  Therefore e^2=s/3 and we already know that s is the sum of the top row therefore a^2+b^2+c^2=s.  Which means that e^2=(a^2+b^2+c^2)/3.  Let's now replace that: a^2   b^2   c^2 c^2+(a^2+b^2+c^2)/3-a^2   (a^2+b^2+c^2)/3   a^2+(a^2+b^2+c^2)/3-c^2 s-c^2-(a^2+b^2+c^2)/3   s-b^2-(a^2+b^2+c^2)/3   s-a^2-(a^2+b^2+c^2)/3 Let's also replace s with (a^2+b^2+c^2) and simplify: a^2   b^2   c^2 c^2+(a^2+b^2+c^2)/3-a^2   (a^2+b^2+c^2)/3   a^2+(a^2+b^2+c^2)/3-c^2 a^2+b^2-(a^2+b^2+c^2)/3   a^2+c^2-(a^2+b^2+c^2)/3   b^2+c^2-(a^2+b^2+c^2)/3 subsection{Multiples of 4} We know that every integer is one of these: 4m, 4m+1, 4m+2, 4m+3.  However if we square all of them we get: (4m)^2 = 16m^2 = 4(4m^2) (4m+1)^2 = 16m^2+8m+1 = 4(4m^2+2m)+1 (4m+2)^2 = 16m^2+16m+4 = 4(4m^2+4m+1) (4m+3)^2 = 16m^2+24m+9 = 4(4m^2+6m+2)+1 Which means that a square number can't be a multiple of 4 plus 2 or a multiple of 4 plus 3 and since all the values have to be squares none of them can be multiple of 4 plus 2 or a multiple of 4 plus 3.  Now let's look at the center value of (a^2+b^2+c^2)/3.  We know that all the squares in it can only be multiple of 4 or a multiple of 4 plus 1.  Here is a table of the inputs and the outputs (0 is a multiple of 4, 1 is a multiple of 4 plus 1, and so on): Output   a^2   b^2   c^2 0   0   0   0 3   0   0   1 3   0   1   0 2   0   1   1 3   1   0   0 2   1   0   1 2   1   1   0 1   1   1   1 Which means we are left with these options: Output   a^2   b^2   c^2 0   0   0   0 1   1   1   1 However we can ignore a^2,b^2,c^2=4j,4k,4l because if that's the case then you could divide everything by 4 and they would still be squares.  Therefore we can ignore it.  This is the only option: 4j+1   4k+1   4l+1 4m+1   4n+1   4t+1 4p+1   4q+1   4r+1 Since they are actually of the form 4(m^2+m)+1 instead of 4j+1 (due to the fact that they are an odd squared) and the fact that j^2+j will always be even we can rewrite it like so: 8j+1   8k+1   8l+1 8m+1   8n+1   8t+1 8p+1   8q+1   8r+1 (PLEASE NOTE: the variables before and the variables after are different!)  The sum of any row must be 12w+3 because the center value is a multiple of 4 plus 1.  Now let's write all the possiblities for whether they're 16j+1 or 16j+9 (We can write anything say 6u+1 as either 12u+1 or 12u+6+1): Sum   a^2   b^2   c^2 16x+3   1   1   1 16x+11   1   1   9 16x+11   1   9   1 16x+19   1   9   9 16x+11   9   1   1 16x+19   9   1   9 16x+19   9   9   1 16x+11   9   9   9 Let's look at a^2,b^2,c^2=16j+1,16k+1,16l+9: 16j+1   16k+1   16l+9 ?   ?   ? ?   ?   ? We know that there can only be one 9 per row/colum/diagonal therefore: 16j+1   16k+1   16l+9 ?   ?   16t+1 ?   ?   16r+1 and we can also put 1s from the diagonal. 16j+1   16k+1   16l+9 ?   16n+1   16t+1 16p+1   ?   16r+1 We also know that there must be one 9 per row/colum/diagonal: 16j+1   16k+1   16l+9 16m+9   16n+1   16t+1 16p+1   16q+9   16r+1 but wait!  There arn't any 9s in the top-left to bottom-right diagonal.  Therefore a^2,b^2,c^2=16j+1,16k+1,16l+9 is impossible.  As well as a^2,b^2,c^2=16j+9,16k+1,16l+1 is impossible becuase of symetry.  We can also ellimenate 2 more options by replacing 1 with 9 and 9 with 1.  So we are down to these: Sum   a^2   b^2   c^2 16x+3   1   1   1 16x+11   1   9   1 16x+19   9   1   9 16x+11   9   9   9 Now let's look at a^2,b^2,c^2=16j+1,16k+9,16l+1: 16j+1   16k+9   16l+9 ?   ?   ? ?   ?   ? We know that there can only be one 9 per row/colum/diagonal therefore: 16j+1   16k+9   16l+1 ?   16n+1   ? ?   16q+1   ? and we can also put a 9 in the bottom right because there must be a 9 in the diagonal. 16j+1   16k+9   16l+1 ?   16n+1   ? ?   16q+1   16r+9 and we can also put a 9 in the bottom left because there must be a 9 in the other diagonal. 16j+1   16k+9   16l+1 ?   16n+1   ? 16p+1   16q+1   16r+9 but wait!  There are two 9s in the bottom row therefore a^2,b^2,c^2=16j+1,16k+9,16l+1 is impossible.  Here are the two options left: Sum   a^2   b^2   c^2 16x+3   1   1   1 16x+11   9   9   9 Looking back at the original table now looks like this: 16j+1   16k+1   16l+1 16m+1   16n+1   16t+1 16p+1   16q+1   16r+1 or 16j+9   16k+9   16l+9 16m+9   16n+9   16t+9 16p+9   16q+9   16r+9 However I now can prove that both of these are impossible!  Imagine that we can split 16j+1 into 32j+1 or 32j+17 and we can keep repeating, but I can prove that all the numbers have to be the same option!  First let's start with the scenaros: a^2   b^2   c^2 n   n   n n   n   m n   m   n n   m   m m   n   n m   n   m m   m   n m   m   m where n and m are their values above some power of 2.  (like: 128+17, n=17)  Now let's get the basic idea:  we want to show that for any different n and m both greater than 0 and smaller than the power of 2  (which we will now write as P) that it won't work unless all numbers are of the form 2^P+n or 2^P+m but not combos of them. Let's start by proving n,n,m is impossible: 2^Pj+n   2^Pk+n   2^Pl+m ?   ?   ? ?   ?   ? To simplify for looks let's replace them with just n or m not 2^Pj+n or 2^Pj+m: n   n   m ?   ?   ? ?   ?   ? We can now put n from the top right m (since there has to be one m per line or else they can't add to the same number.  I have a proof of it but I don't think I need to show that here.  It's already kinda long.)  straight down, and diagonal from it: n   n   m ?   n   n n   ?   n but wait!  There are three n in the left diagonal therefore it can't work.  We are now down to these options:  (and since this doesn't work we can also remove the opposite and the backwards ones!) a^2   b^2   c^2 n   n   n n   m   n m   n   m m   m   m Now let's prove that n,m,n is impossible. n   m   n ?   ?   ? ?   ?   ? Create a line down from it: n   m   n ?   n   ? ?   n   ? Add two m because of the diagonals must have a m: n   m   n ?   n   ? m   n   m but wait!  There are two m in the bottom row therefore it can't work!  Meaning the all the top three values have to be like so: a^2=2^Pj+z b^2=2^Pk+z c^2=2^Pl+z where z is some constant amount.  (We know that z must be constant because we showed that the only options are if it's the same number for all 3.) We also know that P can be as high as we want it to be as long as it's not infinity but a finite number. Let's imagine that 2^P is greater than a^2, b^2, or c^2. Then j,k, and l must all be 0. Which means they all equal z therefore they would be the same number and that is against the rules so there doesn't exist a solution with all squares. Q.E.D.

Now let's write all the possiblities for whether they're 16j+1 or 16j+9 (We can write anything say 6u+1 as either 12u+1 or 12u+6+1): Sum   a^2   b^2   c^2 16x+3   1   1   1 16x+11   1   1   9 16x+11   1   9   1 16x+19   1   9   9 16x+11   9   1   1 16x+19   9   1   9 16x+19   9   9   1 16x+11   9   9   9 Let's look at a^2,b^2,c^2=16j+1,16k+1,16l+9: 16j+1   16k+1   16l+9 ?   ?   ? ?   ?   ? We know that there can only be one 9 per row/colum/diagonal therefore: 16j+1   16k+1   16l+9 ?   ?   16t+1 ?   ?   16r+1 and we can also put 1s from the diagonal. 16j+1   16k+1   16l+9 ?   16n+1   16t+1 16p+1   ?   16r+1 We also know that there must be one 9 per row/colum/diagonal: 16j+1   16k+1   16l+9 16m+9   16n+1   16t+1 16p+1   16q+9   16r+1 but wait!  There arn't any 9s in the top-left to bottom-right diagonal.  Therefore a^2,b^2,c^2=16j+1,16k+1,16l+9 is impossible.  As well as a^2,b^2,c^2=16j+9,16k+1,16l+1 is impossible becuase of symetry.  We can also ellimenate 2 more options by replacing 1 with 9 and 9 with 1.  So we are down to these: Sum   a^2   b^2   c^2 16x+3   1   1   1 16x+11   1   9   1 16x+19   9   1   9 16x+11   9   9   9 Now let's look at a^2,b^2,c^2=16j+1,16k+9,16l+1: 16j+1   16k+9   16l+9 ?   ?   ? ?   ?   ? We know that there can only be one 9 per row/colum/diagonal therefore: 16j+1   16k+9   16l+1 ?   16n+1   ? ?   16q+1   ? and we can also put a 9 in the bottom right because there must be a 9 in the diagonal. 16j+1   16k+9   16l+1 ?   16n+1   ? ?   16q+1   16r+9 and we can also put a 9 in the bottom left because there must be a 9 in the other diagonal. 16j+1   16k+9   16l+1 ?   16n+1   ? 16p+1   16q+1   16r+9 but wait!  There are two 9s in the bottom row therefore a^2,b^2,c^2=16j+1,16k+9,16l+1 is impossible.  Here are the two options left: Sum   a^2   b^2   c^2 16x+3   1   1   1 16x+11   9   9   9 Looking back at the original table now looks like this: 16j+1   16k+1   16l+1 16m+1   16n+1   16t+1 16p+1   16q+1   16r+1 or 16j+9   16k+9   16l+9 16m+9   16n+9   16t+9 16p+9   16q+9   16r+9 However I now can prove that both of these are impossible!  Imagine that we can split 16j+1 into 32j+1 or 32j+17 and we can keep repeating, but I can prove that all the numbers have to be the same option!  First let's start with the scenaros: a^2   b^2   c^2 n   n   n n   n   m n   m   n n   m   m m   n   n m   n   m m   m   n m   m   m where n and m are their values above some power of 2.  (like: 128+17, n=17)  Now let's get the basic idea:  we want to show that for any different n and m both greater than 0 and smaller than the power of 2  (which we will now write as P) that it won't work unless all numbers are of the form 2^P+n or 2^P+m but not combos of them. Let's start by proving n,n,m is impossible: 2^Pj+n   2^Pk+n   2^Pl+m ?   ?   ? ?   ?   ? To simplify for looks let's replace them with just n or m not 2^Pj+n or 2^Pj+m: n   n   m ?   ?   ? ?   ?   ? We can now put n from the top right m (since there has to be one m per line or else they can't add to the same number.  I have a proof of it but I don't think I need to show that here.  It's already kinda long.)  straight down, and diagonal from it: n   n   m ?   n   n n   ?   n but wait!  There are three n in the left diagonal therefore it can't work.  We are now down to these options:  (and since this doesn't work we can also remove the opposite and the backwards ones!) a^2   b^2   c^2 n   n   n n   m   n m   n   m m   m   m Now let's prove that n,m,n is impossible. n   m   n ?   ?   ? ?   ?   ? Create a line down from it: n   m   n ?   n   ? ?   n   ? Add two m because of the diagonals must have a m: n   m   n ?   n   ? m   n   m but wait!  There are two m in the bottom row therefore it can't work!  Meaning the all the top three values have to be like so: a^2=2^Pj+z b^2=2^Pk+z c^2=2^Pl+z where z is some constant amount.  (We know that z must be constant because we showed that the only options are if it's the same number for all 3.) We also know that P can be as high as we want it to be as long as it's not infinity but a finite number. Let's imagine that 2^P is greater than a^2, b^2, or c^2. Then j,k, and l must all be 0. Which means they all equal z therefore they would be the same number and that is against the rules so there doesn't exist a solution with all squares. Q.E.D.

How can *upper bounds for the disproof* be determined?,,"There have been lower bounds estimated for the length $N$ of (odd) steps of a nontrivial cycle in the collatz-problem. Such estimates have been based on knowledge of upper bounds $\chi$ for any number $a_1$ , where it has been empirically determined that they decrease to $1$ and enter the so-called ""trivial cycle"" by the iterated Collatz-transformation. One well known estimate for such length $N$ has been based on the value $\chi_{\Tiny \text{TOdS}} = 5 \cdot 2^{60}$ (due to Tomas Oliveira da Silva, for reference see wikipedia). Recently a new estimate has been published based on $\chi_{\Tiny \text{yoyo}}= 87 \cdot 2^{60} $ such that all $a_1 \lt \chi_{\Tiny \text{yoyo}}$ run into the trivial cycle. Inspired by another question here (but which seem to have really meant to ask for the highest lower bound for $N$ instead) I've got the somehow reciprocal question: Q1: How can we estimate an upper bound for the length $N$ , for which we can disprove a nontrivial ""general cycle"" , based on the knowledge of convergence of all $a_1 \lt \chi_{\Tiny \text{yoyo}}= 87 \cdot 2^{60} $ Remark: Question Q1 includes the question for the most meaningful/rigorous method to arrive at a large number for $N$ .

That concept describes somehow the ""hilliness"" of a trajectory in an assumed cycle, such that an ""1-cycle"" has one local peak, a ""2-cycle"" has two local peaks and so on. It has been proven by the named authors that for ""m-cycles"" with few peaks ( $m<72$ ) there are no nontrivial cycles at all and so any length $N \gt 1$ is already disproved (and this question is answered for such types of cycles). Thus I have introduced in the above the qualifier ""general cycle"" to emphasize that I look for a estimate for an upper bound for $N$ without the respect to the solution for the ""m-cycle"" with small $m$ . For being able to simply translate the notions and notations of the Simons/deWeger-paper into mine here (as requested by @reuns) I extract from [pg 51]: ""m-cycle"" is the same They use the $(3x+1)/2$ and $x/2$ convention for one step;I use ${3a+1\over 2^A}$ (=""Syracuse""-) convention.

They use $x_\min>X_0=301 \cdot 2^{50}$ where I use the newer value $\chi_{\Tiny \text{yoyo}}=87 \cdot 2^{60}$ We apply the same idea for using upper bounds/lower bounds estimates in general.

Lemma 1 For any $n \geq 4$, $$n^{n+1} - (n+1)^n > (n-1)^n - n^{n-1}$$ Proof \begin{align*} &\qquad n^{n+1} - (n+1)^n > (n-1)^n - n^{n-1} \\ &\Leftrightarrow n^{n+1} + n^{n-1} > (n-1)^n + (n+1)^n \\ &\Leftrightarrow n+\frac{1}{n} > \left(1-\frac{1}{n}\right)^n + \left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^n \end{align*} Since $\left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^n < 3$ and $\left(1-\frac{1}{n}\right)^n < 1$, we have  $$\left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^n+\left(1-\frac{1}{n}\right)^n < 4 < n +\frac{1}{n}$$ Lemma 2 For any $k$ and $n \geq 4$,  $$n^{n+k} -(n+k)^n  > n^{n+1} - (n+1)^n$$ Proof \begin{align*} &\qquad n^{n+k} -(n+k)^n  > n^{n+1} - (n+1)^n \\ &\Leftrightarrow n^{n+k} -n^{n+1} > (n+k)^n - (n+1)^n \\ &\Leftrightarrow n^k - n > \left(1+\frac{k}{n}\right)^n - \left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^n  \end{align*} Since $\left(1+\frac{k}{n}\right)^n < 3^k$ and $\left(1-\frac{1}{n}\right)^n < 1$, we have  $$\left(1+\frac{k}{n}\right)^n+\left(1-\frac{1}{n}\right)^n < 3^k +1  < n^k - n $$ as $n > 4$. Now suppose that $a^b - b^a = 3$.  Let $a \geq 4$. If $b = a+k > a$, then we have  \begin{align*} a^{a+k} - (a+k)^a &> a^{a+1} - (a+1)^a \\ &> (a-1)^a - a^{a-1} \\ &> \cdots \\ &> 3^4 - 4^3 = 17 \end{align*} Thus there are no solutions with $b > a \geq 4$. If $a > b \geq 4$, then  $$a^b - b^a = -(b^a - a^b) \leq -17 $$ from what we have seen above. Thus there are no solutions if $a > b \geq 4$. Thus all solutions can be only in the range $1 \leq a,b \leq 4$. Clearly, in this range only $a=4, b=1$ satisfies the given equation.","Find all solutions in positive integers to $a^b -b^a = 3$ It appears that the only solution is $a=4, b=1$. Modular arithmetic is not of much help (apart from deriving that $a,b$ must have opposite parity). We know that $a^x$ dominates the polynomial $x^a$ but this does not seem to yield the result. Tried hard to estimate a bound for $a^b - b^a$ but with no success. Any help is appreciated. This is a problem from a regional mathematics Olympiad.

92,Understanding $p$-adic fields,Understanding -adic fields,p,"OK, I'm completely lost on this. Define the $p$-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_p$ as the projective limit $$\lim_{\leftarrow} \mathbb{Z}/p^n \mathbb{Z}.$$ So, if $a \in \mathbb{Z}_p$, then $a$ can be represented by an infinite sequence of numbers $(a_n)_{n \in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}}$, right? So if $a=(a_1, a_2, \cdots) \in \mathbb{Z}_p$, then $$a \in \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/p^2\mathbb{Z} \times \cdots,$$ with $a_{n+1} \equiv a_n \mod p^n$. So $a_2 \equiv a_1 \mod p$, $a_3 \equiv a_2 \mod p^2,$ so $a_3 \equiv a_1 \mod p,$ and so on (right?). So if I understand it correctly, when you determine $a_1$, all the other $a_i's$ are fixed. So my first question is: how do you determine this $a_1$? Also, I don't grasp the concept of the $p$-adic extension (now with $\mathbb{Q}_p$ as an example).Let $p$ be prime, $x \in \mathbb{Q}_p$ and $v = \nu_p(x)$, the $p$-adic valuation of $x$. Then there exists a sequence of integers $0 \leq a_i \leq p-1$ for $i \geq v$ such that $$ x = \sum_{i=v}^{\infty} a_ip^i.$$ This really doesn't make any sense to me, as an element $x \in \mathbb{Q}_p$ is defined to be an infinite sequence of numbers, while $\sum_{i=v}^{\infty} a_ip^i$ clearly has dimension $1$, i.e. it's just a 'regular' number. I think my misunderstanding of the latter is also the reason why I don't get this: let $p \neq 2$ be a prime and $a \in \mathbb{Z}_p^{\times}$. We define $\Big(\frac{a}{p}\Big)$ to be the legendre symbol $\Big(\frac{a'}{p}\Big)$, with $a' \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $a' \equiv a \mod p$. Again, as $a \in \mathbb{Z}_p^{\times}$ is an infinte sequence of numbers, how can $a \mod p$ be equal to another integer modulo $p$?  Can someone clear up my confusion or tell me where I went wrong? Thanks!","OK, I'm completely lost on this.
