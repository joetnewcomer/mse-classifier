No need to worry about limiting behaviours. I think one way to do this is to write out the Taylor series expansion on both sides, and then try to match coefficients, but that doesn't look so easy. Another way is pick 3 x's , say x = 100, 4000 and 80000, and try to solve for a, b, c at those points, but it seems there is no solution. Are there better ways to approach this problem? Thanks!","I have some functions of $x$, in the form of $d\sqrt{x}$ or $d\log(x)$ where d is known. I would like to rewrite (approximate is fine) them in the form $\dfrac{a}{1 + bx^c}$, where a, b and c are arbitrary. We are talking about dollars here so x goes from 0 to less than 100,000.
