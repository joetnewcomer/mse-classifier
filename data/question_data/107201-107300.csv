0,A Square Inside A Triangle (but with a twist),A Square Inside A Triangle (but with a twist),,"I have a right $\triangle ABC$ and I want to find the side length of one of the legs, $x$, when the square is at its max area, as shown in I am given that $AB + BC$ is $10$. Here's what I tried so far: I found ratios between the sides using similarity, but I wasn't able to get a conclusive answer, just things in terms of each other. I tried to set up equations using the Pythagorean theorem, but that just ended up with some messy variable terms and zero actual progress. The answer is $x=5$, but I want to know how I would go about approaching this kind of problem. It's like others I've seen before here and in other places, but not being given the side lengths threw me off.","I have a right $\triangle ABC$ and I want to find the side length of one of the legs, $x$, when the square is at its max area, as shown in I am given that $AB + BC$ is $10$.

A circle has equation $x^2 + y^2 - ax - by = 0$ with $b \neq 0$. Two chords from the point $A(a,b)$ are such that they are bisected by the $x$-axis (i.e. $AX = XB$ and $AY = YC$ in the diagram).

Can we find 9 points in it such that the distance between every pair of points is strictly greater than $\frac12$? We allow the points to be on the boundary of the square. The question arose in a conversation, and we are pretty confident that there is no such arrangement, and moreover the only configuration with pairwise distances at least half is the one where we take the vertices, the midpoints and the center.

An equivalent formulation is to look at the $\frac14$ blowup of the square and ask whether we can fit 9 circles with radius $\frac14$ in it or not. Moreover, the pigeonhole principle seems intuitively to be too weak for proving this, because if the shapes will be disjoint then each will have area around $\frac18$ and for, say, squares diameter half enforces area exactly $\frac18$, but we can't fit 8 such squares without gaps.","Consider a square with sides of length 1.

45,Insect eyes. Tiling spheres with hexagons - pentagons required as facet size decreases?,Insect eyes. Tiling spheres with hexagons - pentagons required as facet size decreases?,,"I’m an amateur naturalist and am fascinated with the underlying geometry of an insect eye primarily made of hexagonal facets. In particular, how the sphere surface is fully packed as the hexagons become small with respect to the sphere radius. When the hexagon is large relative to the sphere radius, such as a soccer ball, it is a truncated icosahedron with 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons. As the hexagons decrease in size is there a fixed relation between the number of pentagons required and are they still evenly distributed in some pattern? As the hexagons get progressively smaller, is it true to say that the hexagon becomes flatter on the sphere surface and as hexagons can fully pack a plane, does this suggest that at the limit, hexagons alone can fully pack a sphere surface? From my own study of the cornea of a cultivated silk moth eye, the eye diameter is ca. 1.4 mm and the width of each facet across flats is ca. 0.0256 mm (includes wall thickness). But there are a noticeable number of pentagons scattered across the surface, a selection marked with a yellow dot in the image I took below. They seem rather randomly distributed though and wasn’t sure if this was Mother Nature getting a hexagonal facet wrong occasionally or that she can’t bypass geometry and still needs to add some pentagons. If estimating the number of facets on the eye is dividing the hexagonal area (including wall thickness) into the sphere area as good a way as any? In this case gives 7233 for both eyes combined as each silk moth eye is only 2/3rds of a hemisphere. Thanks for any insight!

Copy of book found here Question:- Let $p$ and $q$ be the radii of two circles through $A$, touching $BC$ at $B$ and $C$,       respectively. Then $pq = R^2$. Answer from the book :- $$c = \frac{2p}{\sin B} = \frac{pb}{R},       b = \frac{2q}{\sin C} = \frac{qc}{R}$$ Multiply and simplify. My understanding :- $R$ is the circumradius of triangle $ABC$. By Law Of Sines, $a/\sin A = b/\sin B = c/\sin C = 2R$. The side $AB$ is common to the 2 triangles having radii p and R, just as $AC$ is common to other 2 triangles having radii q and R. By the Law Of Sines, $2p = c/\sin C'$ ,if we call C' as the side which is the 3rd side of triangle whose radius is p and shares AB with ABC. Similarly $2q = a/\sin A'$ if we call A' as the side which is not shared by the triangle whose radius is q. Have I understood correctly so far ? If then, how is $c=2p\sin B$?",,['geometry']

82,"Plotting polar equations of circles not centered at (0, 0)","Plotting polar equations of circles not centered at (0, 0)",,"Good afternoon guys! I'm fairly new to polar coordinates and polar equations, so bear with me please. I understand the equation of a circle with radius $a$ centered at the polar coordinate $(r_0, \phi)$ is as follows: $$ r = r_0cos(\theta-\phi)+\sqrt{a^2-r_0^2sin^2(\theta-\phi)} $$ Where $(r, \theta)$ represents any arbitrary point on the circle. I understand how to derive this equation from Cartesian coordinates as well, and I can recognize how the equation works with relative ease. My problem comes when I try to graph the circle. How would one go about doing it? Take the following example: Let $r_0=5$, $a=2$, and $\phi=tan(3/4)$, meaning we are representing a circle with radius $2$ centered at the Cartesian coordinate $(4, 3)$. If we sub in the values, we get: $$ r = 5cos(\theta-tan(3/4))+\sqrt{4-25sin^2(\theta-tan(3/4))} $$ Now if the circle was centered at $(0, 0)$, to plot such a thing we could simply just start at $\theta=0$ and work our way up to $\theta=2\pi$, subbing in the values as we go and solving for the new radius (which would always be $a$). But since this circle isn't centered at $(0, 0)$, it means that certain lines with angle $\theta$ will never intersect the circle. In this case, if we subbed in $\theta=0$, then $\sqrt{4-25sin^2(\theta-tan(3/4))}$ would evaluate to a complex number, since the line at angle $\theta=0$ does not intersect the circle described by the equation above. Obviously this isn't something we want. So where do you start plotting such an equation?

Let P,Q,R be any three non-collinear points in R2, and let U, V,W be any three other such points. Then there is exactly one affine transformation that maps P to U, Q to V and R to W. and that I know how to calculate the aforementioned affine transformation, I have the following question. Suppose I have two quadrilaterals q1 and q2 in R2. Quadrilateral q1 is allegedly transformed into quadrilateral q2. Is there in this case also one affine transformation that maps q1 to q2? Are there perhaps more? What is the strategy to find the translation and linear transformation of the affine transformation?","Given the Fundamental theorem of affine geometry.
