20,Can the supremum of an uncountable family of measures be replaced by the supremum over a countable subfamily?,Can the supremum of an uncountable family of measures be replaced by the supremum over a countable subfamily?,,"Consider a measurable space $(X,\mathcal{A})$ . Let $\mathcal{M}$ denote the family of all countably additive measures $\mu\colon \mathcal{A}\to [0,+\infty]$ . This family can be made into a partially ordered set by setting $\mu\leq \nu$ iff $\mu(V)\leq \nu(V)$ for every $V\in \mathcal{A}$ . It can be shown, see for instance https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.06753v1.pdf , that $\mathcal{M}$ forms a complete lattice, which means that every $M\subseteq \mathcal{M}$ , possibly uncountable, has the lowest upper bound $\bigvee\limits_{\mu\in M}\mu$ , i.e., the lowest measure $\mu_0\in \mathcal{M}$ with the property that $\mu\leq \mu_0$ for each $\mu\in M$ , and the greatest lower bound, which is defined similarly. My questions are as follows: given $M\subseteq \mathcal{M}$ , can I found a countable subfamily $M_0\subseteq M$ such that $\bigvee\limits_{\mu\in M}\mu=\bigvee\limits_{\mu\in M_0}\mu$ ; if not, does this property hold under some additional assumptions on $\mathcal{A}$ , for instance, if $\mathcal{A}$ is countably generated, i.e., there exists a countable family $\mathcal{E}\subseteq \mathcal{A}$ such that $\mathcal{A}=\sigma(\mathcal{E})$ , where the latter denotes the smallest sigma-algebra containing $\mathcal{E}$ . Let me provide some of my thoughts on this and some additional information. First, I give an explicit definition of the supremum of an arbitrary family $M\subseteq \mathcal{M}$ . For every $V\in \mathcal{A}$ , define \begin{equation*} \mu_0(V)=\sup \sum\limits_{n=1}^{+\infty} \mu_n(V_n), \end{equation*} where the supremum is taken over all pairs $(\{\mu_n\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}, \{V_n\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}})$ , where $\{\mu_n\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}\subseteq M$ and $\{V_n\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ is a partition of $V$ into $\mathcal{A}$ -measurable sets. It turns that thus defined $\mu_0$ lies in $\mathcal{M}$ and is the desired supremum of $M$ . From this definition, it is obvious that for every fixed (!) set $V\in \mathcal{A}$ we can find a countable family $M_0(V)\subseteq M$ such that \begin{equation*} \mu_0(V)=\bigg(\bigvee\limits_{\mu\in M_0(V)} \mu\bigg)(V_0). \end{equation*} This observation gave me a hope that the property from my question may hold for countably generated sigma-algebras. The second thing I want to mention is that the desired property holds when restricted to those $M\subseteq \mathcal{M}$ all measures from which are absolutely continuous with respect to some fixed measure. Such a property is discussed in https://mathoverflow.net/questions/316651/uncountable-infimum-of-measurable-functions , at least for subset of Euclidean space equipped with the standard sigma-algebra and measure. As I understand, the same holds in general, so let me give some general details. Let $\lambda\in \mathcal{M}$ , let me also assume that $\mathcal{A}$ is complete with respect to $\lambda$ , let $F$ be a family of $\lambda$ -measurable functions $X\to [0,+\infty]$ .

27,"Meaning of ""absolute zero"" in set theory","Meaning of ""absolute zero"" in set theory",,"With great pleasure I am reading ""Believing the axioms"" by Penelope Maddy after someone linked to it here on MSE. ( https://www.jstor.org/stable/2274520 ). However on page 495 there is a sentence I don't understand: For example, a subset of the unit interval is called ""absolute zero"" if it can be covered by any countable collection of intervals. (The 'for example' refers to 'strong smallness properties', of which being absolute zero is an example) I don't understand this definition and due to the overwhelming number of articles on the more famous ""absolute zero"" from physics it is impossible to google. I think my problem is with the interpretation of the word 'any'. It seems to me that for every point $x$ in the unit interval it is easy to construct a countable collection of intervals not covering $x$ , hence showing that no non-empty set can be absolute zero. But clearly that is not what is meant. But then, what is? The next sentence from the article does not make it any clearer: If covering is only required when the intervals are of equal length, then the set would have Lebesgue measure zero, but would not necessarily be absolute zero. I was hoping I could think of some criterion that sounds vaguely like 'can be covered by any countable collection of intervals of the same length' that would imply being measure zero but I failed. The next sentence from the article elaborates on the distinction between measure zero and absolute zero: Thus Cantor's discontinuum has Lebesgue measure zero, but is not absolute zero, because it cannot be covered by countable manby intervals of length $(1/3)^n$ . 'Ok', I thought, 'this gives some hint of what might be meant'. Perhaps they meant 'A set $Z$ is absolute zero if for each sequence $a_1, a_2 ,\ldots$ of numbers in $(0, 1]$ there is a collection of intervals $I_1, I_2, \ldots$ such that $I_n$ has length $a_n$ and together the intervals cover $Z$ .' At least this sounds like a well defined property. EDITED IN: Due to Asaf Karagila' comment below I now know that this property actually has name and a Wikipedia page, increasing the likelihood that this indeed is what is meant. END OF EDIT But then I thought what the analogue with 'intervals of equal length' would be and everything collapses: obviously the property 'for each number $a \in (0, 1]$ there is a countable collection of intervals, each of length $a$ , that together cover $X$ ' is true for every subset of $[0,1]$ , not just those of measure zero. So I am back to square one. Can anyone tell me what the definition of 'absolute zero' is and what property implying 'ordinary' measure zero is intended in the second sentence? UPDATE: after reading the wikipedia page on 'strong measure zero' I actually believe that indeed (as Asaf wrote) strong measure zero and absolute zero are the same thing.

Does anyone know?","With great pleasure I am reading ""Believing the axioms"" by Penelope Maddy after someone linked to it here on MSE. ( https://www.jstor.org/stable/2274520 ). However on page 495 there is a sentence I don't understand: For example, a subset of the unit interval is called ""absolute zero"" if it can be covered by any countable collection of intervals. (The 'for example' refers to 'strong smallness properties', of which being absolute zero is an example) I don't understand this definition and due to the overwhelming number of articles on the more famous ""absolute zero"" from physics it is impossible to google. I think my problem is with the interpretation of the word 'any'. It seems to me that for every point in the unit interval it is easy to construct a countable collection of intervals not covering , hence showing that no non-empty set can be absolute zero. But clearly that is not what is meant. But then, what is? The next sentence from the article does not make it any clearer: If covering is only required when the intervals are of equal length, then the set would have Lebesgue measure zero, but would not necessarily be absolute zero. I was hoping I could think of some criterion that sounds vaguely like 'can be covered by any countable collection of intervals of the same length' that would imply being measure zero but I failed. The next sentence from the article elaborates on the distinction between measure zero and absolute zero: Thus Cantor's discontinuum has Lebesgue measure zero, but is not absolute zero, because it cannot be covered by countable manby intervals of length . 'Ok', I thought, 'this gives some hint of what might be meant'. Perhaps they meant 'A set is absolute zero if for each sequence of numbers in there is a collection of intervals such that has length and together the intervals cover .' At least this sounds like a well defined property. EDITED IN: Due to Asaf Karagila' comment below I now know that this property actually has name and a Wikipedia page, increasing the likelihood that this indeed is what is meant. END OF EDIT But then I thought what the analogue with 'intervals of equal length' would be and everything collapses: obviously the property 'for each number there is a countable collection of intervals, each of length , that together cover ' is true for every subset of , not just those of measure zero. So I am back to square one. Can anyone tell me what the definition of 'absolute zero' is and what property implying 'ordinary' measure zero is intended in the second sentence? UPDATE: after reading the wikipedia page on 'strong measure zero' I actually believe that indeed (as Asaf wrote) strong measure zero and absolute zero are the same thing. The relations of both properties to the continuum hypothesis and conjectures by Borel discussed in both articles are just too similar for them not to be the same property.

I understand that the Abelian assumption makes the left-invariance and right-invariance distinction redundant, but does it also make regularity and ""Radon-ity"" equivalent?","\mu \mu(B) = \sup\{\mu(K)\colon K\subseteq B,K~\text{compact}\} = \inf\{\mu(G)\colon G\supseteq B,G~\text{open}\},\forall B~\;\text{Borel}, \mu \mu(K)<\infty,\forall K~\text{compact}, \mu(B) = \inf\{\mu(G)\colon G\supseteq B,G~\text{open}\},\forall B~\text{Borel}, \mu(G) = \sup\{\mu(K)\colon K\subseteq G,K~\text{compact}\},\forall G~\text{open}.","['measure-theory', 'algebraic-topology', 'fourier-analysis', 'locally-compact-groups', 'haar-measure']"
52,Is the exclusion of uncountable additivity a drawback of Lebesgue measure?,Is the exclusion of uncountable additivity a drawback of Lebesgue measure?,,"A friend and I were having a discussion about Lebesgue measure. I attempted to be profound by making the following points: Analytic geometry has been a fantastic tool, but the concept of representing a continuous ""object"" as a collection of points is inherently contrived (with a negative connotation). Immediately we run into the paradox that a point has no volume, and yet a collection of many points has volume. The notion of Lebesgue measure attempts to resolve this essential tension by allowing only countable additivity of the measure.  But it does so only by disallowing certain operations (uncountable sums) that intuitively seem reasonable. As such, it is an indispensable tool, but it remains contrived on some level. My friend countered by saying that uncountable additivity doesn't really make sense anyway, since any uncountable sum that converges must have co-countably many terms zero. I would say I am still on the fence about this discussion. He makes a good point, but after all, it is exactly the addition of uncountably many zeros that I am concerned with, so the notion that co-countably many of the terms must be zero may not be a decisive objection.","A friend and I were having a discussion about Lebesgue measure.

Let $f:\Bbb R\to \Bbb R$ be an additive function and also Lebesgue-measurable: $$\text{I want to prove that:}\;\;f(x)=f(1)\ x\;\;\forall x\in\Bbb R$$ Proof: So first I prove some clearly results. Lemma 1 : $\;f(x-y)=f(x)-f(y)\;\forall x,y\in\Bbb R$ Let $x,y\in\Bbb R$ so, since $f$ is additive, we get that: $$f(0)=f(0+0)=f(0)+f(0)\Rightarrow\ f(0)=0\\ \Rightarrow\ 0=f(0)=f(x+(-x))=f(x)+f(-x)\Leftrightarrow\ -f(x)=f(-x)$$ thereby $\;f(x-y)=f(x)+f(-y)=f(x)-f(y).$ Lemma 2 : $\;r\ f(x)=f(rx)\;\;\forall r\in\Bbb Q\;\forall x\in\Bbb R$ Let $x\in\Bbb R$ we state that $\;n\ f(x)=f(nx)\;\forall n\in\Bbb N$. Because (by induction over n) for $n=2$ is clear that $f(2x)=f(x+x)=f(x)+f(x)=2f(x)$, if we suppose that $f(nx)=nf(x)$ follows for $n$ we get that $f((n+1)x)=f(nx+x)=f(nx)+f(x)=nf(x)+f(x)=(n+1)f(x)$. Then let $\;m=-n\;\;\forall n\in\Bbb N$ thus $\;f(mx)=f(-nx)=-nf(x)=mf(x)$ and hence $f(zn)=zf(x)\;\;\forall z\in\Bbb Z\Rightarrow\ r=\frac{n}{m}$ with $m,n\in\Bbb Z$, $(n,m)=1$ and $m\ne 0$ By last, let $r\in\Bbb Q\setminus\Bbb Z$. So, since $f(mx)=mf(x),$ by taking $x=\frac{y}{m}$ and $q=\frac{1}{m}$ we get that $f(y)=\frac{1}{q}f\big(\frac{y}{m}\big)\Leftrightarrow\ qf(y)=f\big(\frac{y}{m}\big)\Leftrightarrow\ \frac{1}{m}f(y)=f\big(\frac{y}{m}\big)$ and thus $f(rx)=f\big(\frac{n}{m} x\big)=nf\big(\frac{1}{m}x\big)=\frac{n}{m}f(x)=rf(x)$. Now I want to prove that $f$ is continuous: So, it's clear that:  $$\bigcup_{m>0}\{x\in\Bbb R:|f(x)|\le m\}=\Bbb R\ne\emptyset$$ Let $A_m=\{x\in\Bbb R:|f(x)|\le m\}$, then for each fixed $t\in\Bbb R\;\exists\ m_t>0\;$ s.t. $\;t\in A_{m_t}\;$ so $\;\overline{\lambda}(A_{m_t})>0$.(where $A_m\in\mathcal A_{\Bbb R}^*$ follows since $f^{-1}([-m,m])=A_m$ and $f$ is measurable) So, by Steinhaus Theorem , there $\exists\ \delta>0\;$ s.t. if $\;|x|<\delta$ we get that: $$\overline{\lambda}\big(A_{m_t}\cap (A_{m_t}+x)\big)>0\\ \text{and that}\;\; (-\delta,\delta)\subset \{a-a':a,a'\in A_{m_t}\}=:\ A_{m_t}-A_{m_t}$$ Thereby $\forall x\in (-\delta,\delta)\;\;\exists\ a,a'\in A_{m_t}\;$ s.t. $\; x=a-a'\Rightarrow\ f(x)=f(a-a')=f(a)-f(a')\Rightarrow\ |f(x)|=|f(a)-f(a')|\le m_t+m_t=2m_t$. Namely $\forall x\in (-\delta,\delta)\Rightarrow\ |f(x)|\le 2m_t$ so taking $\delta^*=\frac{\delta}{2^{n+1}}$ for $\; n\in\Bbb N\;\;$ we get that: $$\text{if}\;\; |x-y|<\delta^*\Rightarrow\  2^{n+1}|x-y|<\delta\Rightarrow\ |2^{n+1}(x-y)|<\delta\\ \Rightarrow\Big|f\big(2^{n+1}(x-y)\big)\Big|\le 2m_t$$ thus (by lemma 1 and 2) $$|f(x)-f(y)|=|f(x-y)|=\frac{1}{2^{n+1}}\Big|f\big(2^{n+1}(x-y)\big)\Big|\le \frac{2m_t}{2^{n+1}}=\frac{m_t}{2^n}\\ \Rightarrow\ |f(x)-f(y)|\le \frac{m_t}{2^n}\to 0,\;\;\ n\to\infty $$ therefore $f$ is continuous. So at last, let $\epsilon>0$: If $f(1)=0$, $f(x)=xf(1)$ follows straightforward. If $f(1)\ne 0$, we take $\delta_{\epsilon}=\frac{\epsilon}{2|f(1)|}$ so if $|x|<\delta_{\epsilon}$ then $$|f(x)-xf(1)|\le |f(x)|+|x||f(1)|$$ where $|f(x)|<\frac{\epsilon}{2}$ by the particular continuity of $f$ at $0$, so $$|f(x)-xf(1)|\le |f(x)|+|x||f(1)|<\frac{\epsilon}{2}+\delta_{\epsilon}|f(1)|=\frac{\epsilon}{2}+\frac{\epsilon}{2}=\epsilon$$ hence $f(x)=xf(1)\;\;\forall x\in\Bbb R.$","Let $(\Bbb R, \mathcal A_{\Bbb R}^*,\overline{\lambda})$ be the complete lebesgue-measure space.

I'm trying to construct the Haar measure of $\mathbb{T}^n$ . I constructed a measure which is finite and Radon. However I don't how to prove that the measure I constructed is translation invariant. Below I'll sketch the construction. Firstly suppose that $\lambda$ is the Lebesgue measure of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and that $\mathfrak{B}$ is the Borel $\sigma$ -algebra of the unit cube $[0,1]^n$ with the subspace topology of $\mathbb{R}^n$ . Define $\pi :[0,1]^n\to \mathbb{T}^n$ by $\pi (x):=x+\mathbb{Z}^n$ . We can define a metric $d_{\mathbb{T}^n}$ in $\mathbb{T}^n$ such that $\pi$ is continuous (see here ). Let $\mathfrak{B}_{\mathbb{T}^n}$ be the Borel measure of $\mathbb{T}^n$ induced by the topology induced by the metric $d_{\mathbb{T}^n}$ ; Let $\pi _\star (\lambda |_{\mathfrak{B}}) :\pi_\star\mathfrak{B}\to\overline {\mathbb{R}} $ be the pushforward measure of the restriction $\lambda|_{\mathfrak{B}} $ . It's easy to show that $\mathfrak{B}_{\mathbb{T}^n}\subseteq\pi_\star\mathfrak{B} $ since $\pi$ is continuous. Define $\vartheta :\mathfrak{B}_{\mathbb{T}^n}\to \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ by $\vartheta (B):=\pi _\star (\lambda |_{\mathfrak{B}}) (B)$ . We can show that $\vartheta :\mathfrak{B}_{\mathbb{T}^n}\to \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is a probability measure of $\mathbb{T}^n$ and it's also a Radon measure. My question is: how can I show that $\vartheta $ is translation invariant? I did almost nothing worth mentioning. I think it's important to observe that the restriction $\pi |_{[0,1)^n}:[0,1)^n\to\mathbb{T}^n$ is bijective. With the property of pushforward measure we can show that, given any $B\in\mathfrak{B}_{\mathbb{T}^n}$ and $a\in\mathbb{T}^n$ , we have $$\vartheta(B+a)=\int _{\mathbb{T}^n}\mathbf{1}_{B+a}d\vartheta=\int _{[0,1]^n}\mathbf{1}_{B+a}(\pi (x))d\lambda (x)\,\,\color{red}{(1)} $$ Above $\mathbf{1}_{B+a}$ is the indicator function of $B+a$ .

90,What is the motivation of defining weak derivative as it is?,What is the motivation of defining weak derivative as it is?,,"I've been reading lately about reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) and Gaussian processes (GP) and during my studies I came across with the concept of weak derivative and Sobolev spaces. I have tried to get some sense from weak derivative by reading these two questions at the site: What is the intuition behind a function being 'weakly differentiable'? Intuition about weakly differentiable functions So I have learned now that: A function $u:\Omega\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is weakly differentiable   with $\alpha$ th ( $\alpha\in\mathbb{N}^n$ ) weak partial derivative $v=D^{\alpha}u$ , if for all compactly supported smooth functions $\phi$ it holds that: $$\int_{\Omega} u \,D^{\alpha}\phi\,dx =  (-1)^{|\alpha|}\int_{\Omega}v\phi\,dx.$$ Quoting earlier answers (by user Christopher A. Wong) from the links I provided above: The basic intuition is that a weakly differentiable function looks   differentiable except for on sets of zero measure. This allows   functions that are not normally considered differentiable at ""corners""   to have a weak derivative that is defined everywhere on the original   function's domain. The reason why weak derivatives ignore sets of zero   measure is precisely because weak derivatives are defined by   integrals, and integrals cannot see behavior on sets of zero measure. Now I'm almost satisfied with this answer, but one unclarity remains: Why is the weak derivative defined as it is? That is, when the idea of weak derivative was first considered, whoever it was, why did he select that particular equation above as the definition? Or was this definition a somewhat arbitrary choice, which simply suited to our purposes? For example, one of the reasons of using squared error in many problems of statistics or optimization is (as I've understood) because the squared error has nice analytical properties, making the math easy, when compared with e.g. absolute error. The reason why I'm asking this, is that sometimes it seems many techniques of mathematics rise like from a magicians hat. For a beginner like myself, it is difficult to picture the scenario and conditions that gave rise to that discovery or definition.","I've been reading lately about reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) and Gaussian processes (GP) and during my studies I came across with the concept of weak derivative and Sobolev spaces.
