One-eighth of a pie is $\frac{1}{8}$ of $2\pi$ radians. The measure of the angle is $\frac{1}{8} \cdot 2\pi = \frac{2\pi}{8} = \frac{\pi}{4}$. A 10-inch pie has a 5-inch radius. Putting the angle and radius into the formula, for the area of a sector, $A= \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\pi}{4} \cdot 5^2 = \frac{25\pi}{8} \approx 9.82$ square inches. There isn't too much difference, but it looks like the smaller part of the bigger pie has the larger piece, in terms of area. My question: Is how do one, get, $2\pi$ radians?",,['trigonometry']
