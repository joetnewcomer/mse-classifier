1,"the basis for the Sobolev space $H^1_0([0,1],\mathbb{R})$",the basis for the Sobolev space,"H^1_0([0,1],\mathbb{R})","According to the Sturm-Liouville theorem, for any continuous function $p\in\mathcal{C}^0([0,1],\mathbb{R})$, there is a Hilbert basis (normlised) $(\psi_n)_{n\geq1}$ of $L^2([0,1],\mathbb{R})$ such that $\psi_n\in\mathcal{C}^2([0,1],\mathbb{R})(\forall n)$ and $$-\psi_n''+p\psi_n=\lambda_n\psi_n$$ on $[0,1]$ and $\psi_n(0)=\psi_n(1)=0$.

Consider the following thought experiment: We can consider the identity operator to be the limit of a sequence of gaussians in a convolution algebra.  Similarly, we can consider the differential operator $D$ to be the limit of a sequence of derivatives of gaussians .  These give us a pretty solid basis for visualizing what these operators look like (graphics courtesy of wikipedia): When we extend to fractional operators, we obtain a continuous interpolation between these two: As the order increases past $1$ , more peaks emerge.  Notice that this is beginning to look an awful lot like a wavelet basis... Now, these operators act convolutionally - so, given some function $f$ in the convolution algebra, we can consider $f'(t) = \langle D,(x \to f(x-t)) \rangle$ .  In particular, we can consider $f^{(a)}(0) = \langle D^a,f \rangle$ . This notation seems highly suggestive - we have an indexed family of operators ( $D^a$ ), and a continuous function defined by their action (via the inner product) on a given reference function. When we do this same thing with sinusoids, we get a Fourier transform.  Does this yield anything similar? Viewed another way: when we only look at derivatives of discrete order, this kind of expansion yields a power series.  If fractional calculus allows us to look at derivatives of continuous order, can we generalize a power series to some sort of continuous spectrum, in the same way we generalize from a discrete Fourier series to a continuous Fourier transform?

12,Existence of Dual for an Infinite Linear Program,Existence of Dual for an Infinite Linear Program,,"I am concerned with proving the existence of the dual of an infinite linear program. In addition to the writings of Rockafellar, Luenberger, and Boyd & Vandenberghe on: subdifferentials, Legendre-Fenchel transforms and the convex conjugate of a function, indicator functions, support functions/hyperplanes etc, I have consulted the following resources that seem to address this problem directly: http://web.mit.edu/mitter/www/publications/113_convex_optimization_RALC.pdf (Chapter 3) https://sites.math.washington.edu/~rtr/papers/rtr054-ConjugateDuality.pdf (Theorem 11 on page 34) While I am able to follow the development of the duality formalism developed therein, I am having trouble explicitly proving the existence of a dual problem for my infinite linear program in $\ell_1$ . I know the dual problem ought to be in $\ell_\infty$ , if it exists, but I am unsure how to proceed with an explicit formulation. Rockafellar's Conjugate Duality SIAM Publication only requires continuity of the optimal value function in the infinite dimensional case. My objective function $f:\ell_1\to\mathbb{R}$ , which I seek to minimize, in the variable $x=\{x_{ij}\}\in \ell_1$ , with $\{a_{ij}\}\in\ell_1$ being parameters, is: $$ f(x) =  \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}a_{ij}x_{ij} $$ The constraints for my problem are all equality constraints. Rockafellar's discussion of existence, especially in Theorem 11, didn't seem concerned with the constraints, so I haven't considered them for proving existence of the dual problem. My question is as follows: Is it necessary to frame my objective function as Rockafellar does on page 18? That is to say: specifying a representation $f(x) = F(x,u) \quad u\in U, x\in X$ , where $X$ and $U$ are Banach spaces, and $u=0$ , which I believe would be the case to relate this representation to my objective function. Then, setting $\varphi (u) = \inf_{x\in X} F(x,u)$ , and attempting to show the dual exists via Theorem 11? If not, what would be the correct way of framing my objective function to show the dual exists? Please let me know if you need more information, or if I am misunderstanding anything, since I simply just want to show the dual exists for this problem. I have been using this site for years, but have recently joined and this is my first question, and I wasn't sure if it should be split up into separate questions or anything like that, so I hope it provides enough context and is answerable :)","I am concerned with proving the existence of the dual of an infinite linear program.

13,Dual Space of General $L^p$ Space Which Takes Values in Banach Space,Dual Space of General  Space Which Takes Values in Banach Space,L^p,"Last week, our functional analysis course covered Riesz Representation theorem for $L^p(X,\mu),(1\leq p < \infty)$ , namely, $(L^p(X,\mu))^* = L^q(X,\mu)$ . And I was stuck with this homework problem to work out the dual space of a  more general version of $L^p$ space: Let $X$ be a Banach space and assume both $X$ and $X^*$ are known, define $L^p([0,1],X)=\{f(t):[0,1]\rightarrow X\big{|}\int_0^1 ||f(t)||^p_X\text{d}t<\infty\}$ where $||\cdot||_X $ is norm in $X$ and define similar $L^p$ norm: $||f||_p =  \big{(}\int_0^1 ||f(t)||^p_X\text{d}t\big{)}^\frac{1}{p}$ . The question is to determine what is [ $L^p([0,1],X)]^*$ ? My first guess is $[L^p([0,1],X)]^*=L^q([0,1],X^*)$ , where $\frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{q}=1$ . To begin with, if we are given $g(s)\in L^q([0,1],X^*)$ and define $T_g\in [L^p([0,1],X)]^* $ by $$ T_g(f) = \int_0^1 g(s)(f(s)) \text{d}s $$ Apparently, since each $g(s)$ is a linear functional of $X$ ,then $T(g)$ is a linear functional. Besides, \begin{align} |T_g(f)|\leq\int_{0}^{1} |g(s)(f(s))| \mathrm{d} s &\leq \int_{0}^{1} ||g(s)||_{X^*}\cdot||f(s)||_X \mathrm{d} s\\ \leq (\int_{0}^{1}\|g(s)\|_{X^*}^{q} \mathrm{d} s)^{\frac{1}{q}}\cdot(\int_{0}^{1}\|f(s)\|_{X}^{p} \mathrm{d} s)^{\frac{1}{p}}  = &||g||_{q}\cdot ||f||_p \end{align} I use Hölder's inequality above. This justifies $T(g)\in $ [ $L^p([0,1],X)]^*$ and $||T_g||\leq ||g||_q$ . However, I got stuck to preceed to verify next two things: Find $f \in L^{q}([0,1],X)$ such that $T_g(f) \geq ||g||_q$ Given $T\in \left[L^{p}([0,1], X)\right]^{*}$ , how to find $g\in L^{q}\left([0,1], X^{*}\right)$ such that $T(f)=\int_{0}^{1} g(s)(f(s)) \mathrm{d} s$ holds for any $f\in L^p([0,1],X)$ ? I try to invoke Radon- Nikodym theorem by first defining characteristic funtion $\chi_E(t) = \begin{cases}  x_0 &t\in E\\ 0, & t \notin E\end{cases}$ , where $x_0$ is a unit vector in $X$ and $E \subset [0,1]$ , so we have $\chi_E \in L^{p}([0,1], X)$ . Next, we define $\nu(E) = T(\chi_E)$ , then we prove $\nu$ is indeed a signed measure and $\nu<< m$ , where $m$ denotes Lebesgue measure here. By Radon-Nikodym theorem, there exists $g:[0,1]\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that $\nu(E) = \int_0^1 ||\chi_E(s)||_X\cdot g(t) \text{d}s $ but I hope to get $g:[0,1]\rightarrow X^*$ such that $\nu(E) = \int_0^1  g(s)(\chi_E(s)) \text{d}s $ One reason why the definition $T_g(f)=\int_{0}^{1} g(s)(f(s)) \mathrm{d} s$ might be reasonable is because I can let $X=\mathbb{R}$ , then $T_g(f)=\int_{0}^{1} g(s)(f(s)) \mathrm{d} s = \int_{0}^{1} g(s)\cdot f(s) \mathrm{d} s$ as the normal $L^p$ space.

14,The category of C* algebras has cokernels,The category of C* algebras has cokernels,,"Let $\mathcal{C}^*$ be the category defined as follows: $1.\text{Ob}(\mathcal{C}^*)=\{C^*\text{-algebras}\}$ $2.$ For $A,B\in\mathcal{C}^*$ set $\text{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}^*}(A,B)=\{\varphi:A\to B\;|\; \varphi \text{ is a $*$-homomorphism} \}$ This is a category (it can be easily verified) and we know that $\text{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}^*}(A,B)$ is exactly the set of norm-decreasing homomorphisms (also easily proved). With these homomorphisms, $\mathcal{C^*}$ actually is NOT additive, as we cannot simply add $*$ -homomorphisms (the result is not a $*$ -homomorphism). However, we do have kernels. My question is : does $\mathcal{C}^*$ have cokernels? I believe so, and here is my work: Let $A\xrightarrow{\varphi}B$ be a morphism in $\mathcal{C}^*$ . Let $I$ denote the closed (double) ideal generated by $\varphi(A)$ . Then $B/I$ (with quotient norm) is a $C^*$ -algebra and we have the quotient $*$ -homomorphism $\pi:B\to B/I$ . I claim that $\text{cokernel}(A\xrightarrow{\varphi}B)=B\xrightarrow{\pi}B/I$ . The description of $I$ is the closed linear span of the set $S:=\{\varphi(a),\varphi(a)b, b\varphi(a), b\varphi(a)b': a\in A, b,b'\in B\}$ (maybe this can be simplified if we consider the unitization of $B$ , but I'd like to avoid it right now). If $B\xrightarrow{\psi}D$ is a $*$ -homomorphism such that $\psi\circ\varphi=0$ , then we define $\bar{\psi}:B/I\to D$ by $\bar{\psi}(b+I)=\psi(b)$ . First we need to show that $\bar{\psi}$ is a well defined $*$ -homomorphism. The only non-trivial thing is that $\bar{\psi}$ is well defined. But if $b-b'\in I$ , we need to show that $\psi(b-b')=0$ . But $b-b'=\displaystyle{\lim_{n\to\infty}u_n}$ where $u_n\in\overline{\text{span}(S)}$ . By $\psi$ 's continuity and preservation of sum and scale, it suffices to show that $\psi\equiv0$ on $S$ . but this is true, since $\psi(\varphi(a))=0, \psi(\varphi(a)b)=\psi(\varphi(a))\psi(b)=0,\dots$ and so on. Obviously $\bar{\psi}\circ\pi=\psi$ and if $\bar{\psi}':B/I\to D$ was another such morphism, then $\bar{\psi}'(b+I)=\bar{\psi}'\circ\pi(b)=\psi(b)=\bar{\psi}(b+I)$ , so we have uniqueness. This is the universal property of cokernels, so we are done. Does my proof contain mistakes? If someone can confirm that there are no mistakes, I suggest editing the title and taking the question mark off. A comment: Note that $\varphi(A)$ is not equal to the image in the categorical setting: an obvious reason: the image is defined as the kernel of the cokernel. but kernels are always ideals, $\varphi(A)$ is not necessarily an ideal.

This is the eigenbasis of the quantum harmonic oscillator with $m\omega =1=\hbar$. To add further background, the system $\psi_z$ are called coherent states and are closely linked to Segal-Bargmann spaces. I don't think the exact choice of basis matters though, in any case it doesn't seem to matter for calculations of the type needed to solve the problem below) I'm trying to solve the following problem: Let $P$ be a signed (real) measure on the Borel sets of $\mathbb{C}$, such that $P(\mathbb{C})=1.$   Consider the linear operator defined by   $$R:L^2(\mathbb{R})\ni\phi\mapsto \int_{\mathbb{C}} \psi_z \langle \psi_z, \phi\rangle dP(z).$$   What are additional, sufficient conditions to the measure $P$, such that this operator becomes self-adjoint, positive and trace class with trace equal to $1$? (This representation for a density operator is called ""Glauber–Sudarshan P representation"" and used in quantum optics) I am a physicist, and (no implication implied) my ability to make rigorous mathematical statements is somewhat lacking, especially when it comes to Bochner-integrals, as used in the definition of $R$ and, even worse, signed measures. Nevertheless I decided to get the math right on this one, which I need a little help for. Here is what I have done so far: I'm already failing to prove that the operator is even well-defined as a bounded map. The main problem seems to be that any decomposition theorem for the measure will prevent me from using the fact that the measure of the whole plane is one.

(Actually I'm only interested in the special case where the orthonormal basis is given by \begin{equation} |n\rangle (x)= \frac{\pi^{\frac{1}{4}}}{\sqrt{2^n n!}}H_n(x)\exp({-\frac{x^2}{2}}) \end{equation} with the Hermite-Polynomials $H_n$. This is the eigenbasis of the quantum harmonic oscillator with $m\omega =1=\hbar$. To add further background, the system $\psi_z$ are called coherent states and are closely linked to Segal-Bargmann spaces. I don't think the exact choice of basis matters though, in any case it doesn't seem to matter for calculations of the type needed to solve the problem below) I'm trying to solve the following problem: Let $P$ be a signed (real) measure on the Borel sets of $\mathbb{C}$, such that $P(\mathbb{C})=1.$   Consider the linear operator defined by   $$R:L^2(\mathbb{R})\ni\phi\mapsto \int_{\mathbb{C}} \psi_z \langle \psi_z, \phi\rangle dP(z).$$   What are additional, sufficient conditions to the measure $P$, such that this operator becomes self-adjoint, positive and trace class with trace equal to $1$? (This representation for a density operator is called ""Glauber–Sudarshan P representation"" and used in quantum optics) I am a physicist, and (no implication implied) my ability to make rigorous mathematical statements is somewhat lacking, especially when it comes to Bochner-integrals, as used in the definition of $R$ and, even worse, signed measures. Nevertheless I decided to get the math right on this one, which I need a little help for. Here is what I have done so far: I'm already failing to prove that the operator is even well-defined as a bounded map. The main problem seems to be that any decomposition theorem for the measure will prevent me from using the fact that the measure of the whole plane is one.

The result which can be found in Galdi's ""An introduction to the mathematical theory of the Navier-Stokes equations"" volume 1, and may have originated with Bogovskii in 1979 or so, states: If $\Omega$ is an open bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^n$ ($n\geq 2$) that is star-like with respect to every point in the unit ball $B_1(0)=B,\ \overline{B}\subset \Omega$, and $g\in W_0^{k,p}(\Omega)$ for $k\geq 0$ and $p>1$ with $\int_\Omega g\ dV=0$ then letting $\omega$ be smooth, compactly supporting in $B$, and $\int_B\omega\ dV=1$, the vector field $$ \mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x})= \int_\Omega g(\mathbf{y})\left[ \frac{\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}|^n}\int_{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}|}^\infty \omega\left(\mathbf{y}+\xi\frac{\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}|}\right)\xi^{n-1}d\xi\right]dV_\mathbf{y} $$ satisfies $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x})=g(\mathbf{x})$ and $\mathbf{v}\in W_0^{k+1,p}(\Omega)^n$.  Specifically, $\mathbf{v}$ has support in the convex combinations of the support of $g$ and $B$. If $g\in L^p(\Omega)$ this provides a solution $\mathbf{v}\in W_0^{1,p}(\Omega)^n$, however if $g$ has more regularity (but is not compactly supported) it does not appear that $\mathbf{v}$ necessarily possesses the extra regularity up to the boundary (does it?).  Other methods show there are solutions with higher regularity up to the boundary but may not retain the property of compact support. My specific question is if there is a manner to adapt this result to a case like $\Omega_+=\{\mathbf{x}\in \Omega: \mathbf{e}_0\cdot \mathbf{x}>0\}$ and given data $g\in W^{k,p}_0(\Omega)$ get a solution $\mathbf{v}\in W^{k,p}(\Omega_+)^n$, which satisfies Dirichlet boundary conditions when $\mathbf{x}\cdot\mathbf{e}_0=0$ and has compact support in $\overline{\Omega_+}\cap \Omega$.  I think this would be a useful result and wonder if there is a similar formula including a Green's function on the hyperplane.  I am not very comfortable with the techniques and would appreciate the help of someones expertise. More generally, what is the property of the divergence operator that allows the construction of such a compactly supported solution and are there other operators for which a similar result applies?

The result which can be found in Galdi's ""An introduction to the mathematical theory of the Navier-Stokes equations"" volume 1, and may have originated with Bogovskii in 1979 or so, states: If $\Omega$ is an open bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^n$ ($n\geq 2$) that is star-like with respect to every point in the unit ball $B_1(0)=B,\ \overline{B}\subset \Omega$, and $g\in W_0^{k,p}(\Omega)$ for $k\geq 0$ and $p>1$ with $\int_\Omega g\ dV=0$ then letting $\omega$ be smooth, compactly supporting in $B$, and $\int_B\omega\ dV=1$, the vector field $$ \mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x})= \int_\Omega g(\mathbf{y})\left[ \frac{\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}|^n}\int_{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}|}^\infty \omega\left(\mathbf{y}+\xi\frac{\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}|}\right)\xi^{n-1}d\xi\right]dV_\mathbf{y} $$ satisfies $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x})=g(\mathbf{x})$ and $\mathbf{v}\in W_0^{k+1,p}(\Omega)^n$.  Specifically, $\mathbf{v}$ has support in the convex combinations of the support of $g$ and $B$. If $g\in L^p(\Omega)$ this provides a solution $\mathbf{v}\in W_0^{1,p}(\Omega)^n$, however if $g$ has more regularity (but is not compactly supported) it does not appear that $\mathbf{v}$ necessarily possesses the extra regularity up to the boundary (does it?).  Other methods show there are solutions with higher regularity up to the boundary but may not retain the property of compact support. My specific question is if there is a manner to adapt this result to a case like $\Omega_+=\{\mathbf{x}\in \Omega: \mathbf{e}_0\cdot \mathbf{x}>0\}$ and given data $g\in W^{k,p}_0(\Omega)$ get a solution $\mathbf{v}\in W^{k,p}(\Omega_+)^n$, which satisfies Dirichlet boundary conditions when $\mathbf{x}\cdot\mathbf{e}_0=0$ and has compact support in $\overline{\Omega_+}\cap \Omega$.  I think this would be a useful result and wonder if there is a similar formula including a Green's function on the hyperplane.  I am not very comfortable with the techniques and would appreciate the help of someones expertise. More generally, what is the property of the divergence operator that allows the construction of such a compactly supported solution and are there other operators for which a similar result applies?
