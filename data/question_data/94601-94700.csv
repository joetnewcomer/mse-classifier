1,About holomorphic function which avoids $\mathbb R$,About holomorphic function which avoids,\mathbb R,"I was asking myself whether or not the following statement is true, and I think it is. The conjecture Let $f$ be an entire function, i.e. $f$ holomorphic and $f:\mathbb C\to \mathbb C$. We assume that $$f(\mathbb C)\cap \mathbb R=\emptyset.$$ Then $f$ is constant. What I tried This statement came to me because of the Cauchy-Riemann equations. If $f$ is an holomorphic function ($f:\mathbb R^2\simeq \mathbb C\to \mathbb C$), $P(x,y)=\mathfrak R(f)$ and $Q=\mathfrak I(f)$ then $$\begin{cases} \displaystyle\frac{\partial P}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial Q}{\partial y} \\ \displaystyle\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}=-\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}. \end{cases}$$ With those equations, we can say that if $f(\mathbb C)\subset \mathbb R$, then $f$ is constant (we then have both partial derivates of $Q$ which are null). May be we could find a solution here, because if $f(\mathbb C)\cap \mathbb R=\emptyset$, then $Q$ doesn't change sign. But we lack a lot of informations to conclude... May be we can use Liouville theorem to prove a partial result: if $$\vert f(x)\vert \xrightarrow[\vert z \vert \to \infty]{} +\infty$$ then $f$ is constant. But again, this is not really satisfying.","I was asking myself whether or not the following statement is true, and I think it is.

23,Silly question: is there any homotopy version of the residue theorem?,Silly question: is there any homotopy version of the residue theorem?,,"Many textbooks contain statements and proofs of the Jordan curve version, the homology version or the homotopy version of Cauchy's integral formula. In the first two cases, corresponding versions of the residue theorem are often also prsented, but apparently, no textbook states the residue theorem in terms of homotopy. If my impression is correct, why are homology or Jordan curve relevant to both theorems but homotopy is relevant only to one of them? What is the decisive difference between homotopy and the other two notions? Background. Earlier this year, I was trying to re-learn complex analysis at undergraduate level from Cartan's Elementary Theory of Analytic Functions of One or Several Complex Variables . In his book, two versions of Cauchy's integral formula are presented. The first one, a homotopic form, is based on a notion of ""primitive of a differential $1$ -form along a homotopy"". Its development and proof are very elegant. The assumptions in the theorem statement are amazingly weak: the closed curves are only required to be continuous ; they are not required to be rectifiable or piecewise $C^1$ . Just as I was exclaiming in delight about the elegance of this homotopic form, Cartan presented an ""alternative form of Cauchy's integral formula"" in §2.II.8, theorem 5 (p.74): Let $\Gamma$ be the oriented boundary of a compact subset $K$ of an open set $D$ and let $f(z)$ be a holomorphic function in $D$ . Then, $$ \int_\Gamma f(z)dz=0; $$ if, moreover, $a$ is an interior point of $K$ , then $$ \int_\Gamma \frac{f(z)dz}{z-a}=2\pi i f(a). $$ To my dismay, the proof of this alternative form relied on completely different machineries. In particular, the proof ultimately relied on the implicit function theorem as well as Green's theorem. The application of the former is so weird (at least to a non-expert like me) that I needed to ask a question on this site to understand what was going on, and the latter was stated without proof. Thus it seemed to me that the proof of this alternative form (or the book) wasn't self contained. Worse still, not only had Cartan not explained any relationship between the two versions of Cauchy's integral formula, but his proof of the residue theorem also relied on this alternative form rather than the homotopical one. At this point, I realized that I had never seen any textbook on complex analysis that presented a homotopical version of the residue theorem, and I wondered why.","Many textbooks contain statements and proofs of the Jordan curve version, the homology version or the homotopy version of Cauchy's integral formula.

Since $i \in B_2(0)$ , we can apply the Cauchy Integral Formula to get $$\int_{\vert z \vert = 2} \frac{1}{z^2+1}dz = \int_{\vert z \vert = 2} \frac{1/(z+i)}{(z-i)}dz = 2\pi i f(i)$$ where $f(z) = \frac{1}{z+i}$ . Hence, the integral evaluates to $\pi$ since $f(i) = \frac{1}{2i}$ . Method $2$ : This is almost identical to the above. Write $\frac{1}{z^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{(z+i)(z-i)} = \frac{1/(z-i)}{z-(-i)}$ . Since $-i \in B_2(0)$ , we can apply the Cauchy Integral Formula to get $$\int_{\vert z \vert = 2} \frac{1}{z^2+1}dz = \int_{\vert z \vert = 2} \frac{1/(z-i)}{(z-(-i))}dz = 2\pi i g(-i)$$ where $g(z) = \frac{1}{z-i}$ . Hence, the integral evaluates to $-\pi$ since $g(-i) = -\frac{1}{2i}$ . Method $3$ : Using partial fractions, $\frac{1}{z^2+1} = \frac{1}{(z+i)(z-i)} = -\frac{1}{2i}\left(\frac{1}{z+i} - \frac{1}{z-i}\right)$ . So, $$\int_{\vert z \vert = 2} \frac{1}{z^2+1}dz = -\frac{1}{2i} \left(\int_{\vert z \vert = 2} \frac{1}{z+i}dz - \int_{\vert z \vert = 2}\frac{1}{z-i}dz\right) = 0$$ since both integrals are $2\pi i$ .

Since the fact of the function being holomorphic appears to be pretty important, I'm starting with it. Here's the definition: The function $f$ is holomorphic at the point $z_0 \in \Omega$ if the quotient $$\frac{f(z_0+h)-f(z_0)}{h}$$ converges to a limit when $h \to 0$. Then we are given two examples. First of the function $f(z)=z$ being holomorphic on any open set in $\Bbb C$, and $f'(z) = 1$. And second of the function $f(z)=\bar z$ being not holomorphic . While I think I understand first example, I cannot see how the second will be different, how the fact of the complex conjugate changes the set up? Basically, why $f(z)=\bar z$ is not holomorphic by definition?  I am aware of the Cauchy-Riemann equations, but I want to see the proof based on the definition (especially that the fact is claimed at this point in the book). I tried to search for an answer but didn't find anything particularly related. I also think I might miss some very basic concept.

I tried factorizing this polynomial and find the residues but I really can't solve this. This is my work: $$z_{1,2} = \frac{-3i\pm \sqrt{-9-(-4-1)} }{2i+1}=\frac{-3i\pm 2i}{1+2i} \cdot \frac{1-2i}{1-2i}= \frac{-3i-6\pm 2i\pm 4}{5}$$ which gives $z_1 = -\frac{2}{5}-\frac{i}{5}$ and $z_2 = -2-i$. Now clearly $z_2$ is outside the unit circle so I just have to consider the residue of $z_1$. However I think I'm either making a factorisation mistake or a mistake in the roots. Indeed if we check the roots, I don't get the same polynomial! $$(z+2+i)\left(z+\frac{2}{5}+\frac{i}{5}\right) = z^2 +z\left(\frac{12}{5}+\frac{6i}{5}\right)+\frac{4i}{5}+\frac{3}{5}$$ which is clearly not the same polynomial I started with. Also if I try to calculate the residue using the limit, I don't get the correct one. Where's my mistake? EDIT As requested, I'll add some more calculations. To calculate the residue I did the following: $$\lim_{z\to z_1}(z+\frac{2}{5}+\frac{i}{5})\frac{2}{(z+2+i)\left(z+\frac{2}{5}+\frac{i}{5}\right)} = \frac{2}{\frac{8}{5}+\frac{4i}{5}} = \frac{5}{4+2i} = \frac{20-10i}{20}=1-\frac{i}{2}$$ which is clearly wrong as this integral is the mapping of a real integral of the first type (rational function in sine and cosine). Indeed by Cauchy's Residue Theorem this should give that the value of the initial real integral is $2\pi i (1-\frac{i}{2}) = 2\pi i+\pi$ which is a complex value, so this is wrong","I'm doing complex analysis and I have the following $$\int_{C}\frac{2dz}{(2i+1)z^2+6iz+2i-1}$$ where $C$ is the unit circle.
