2,"Prove that any injective function from $\{ 1, \dots, n \}$ to itself is bijective.",Prove that any injective function from  to itself is bijective.,"\{ 1, \dots, n \}","This is Exercise 1 from page 50 of Analysis I by Amann and Escher. I have found similar questions here and here but neither of those questions has a solution that uses what's hinted at in the text. Exercise: My attempt: It seems simple to argue that, since an injective function sends each element in its domain to a different element in the codomain, it has to ""hit"" all the elements in $\{ 1, \dots, n \}$ . I am not sure if this is formal enough, and at any rate it doesn't use the hint given. If I use the hint, then the base case of an injective function $\{ 1 \} \to \{ 1 \}$ is definitely bijective. Assume that any injective function from $\{ 1, \dots, n \}$ to $\{ 1, \dots, n \}$ is bijective, and consider the injective function $f \colon \{ 1 , \dots, n + 1 \} \to \{ 1 , \dots, n + 1 \}$ as described. We want to show that $f$ is bijective. It seems to me that there are at least two basic ways to show that $f$ is bijective. First, we can show that it's surjective, which involves considering some element $l \in \{ 1 , \dots, n + 1 \}$ and showing there exists an element $m$ in the same set such that $f(m) = l$ . The second way is to show that there exists a function $i$ such that $f \circ i$ is the identity function. However, an inductive proof should really use the inductive assumption, and I'm not sure either of these tactics do. I find the hint given pretty mystifying, but I have collected a few thoughts regarding the hint below. I see that $g$ is bijective. It is almost the identity function except that it sends $k$ to $n + 1$ and $n + 1$ to $k$ . Since $f$ and $g$ are injective, $h$ is also injective. I also see that $g$ undoes what $f$ does to $n + 1$ , hence $h(n + 1) = n + 1$ . The function $h$ is almost the same as $f$ , except for the swapping done by $g$ as described in 1. The restriction $h \mid \{ 1, \dots, n\}$ does not send any element to $n + 1$ , because the only element that $h$ sends to $n + 1$ is $n + 1$ , and $n + 1$ is outside the restriction. I have no idea how to cobble this into a proof. I appreciate any help.","This is Exercise 1 from page 50 of Analysis I by Amann and Escher.

24,Program to find closest function to fit arbitrary data,Program to find closest function to fit arbitrary data,,"I've wanted this for years, but have never come across anything; a program for Windows to find the closest function to fit arbitrary data. The data I feed it is simple: A table with two columns comprising an initial number on the left side, and the converted number on the right. This below is a very simple example. The program should easily be able to see the pattern: 10 -> 110 20 -> 410 30 -> 910 40 -> 1610 So there, the program would find the formula to be x^2+10. More complicated may be something like this: 5 -> 16 7 -> 23 15 -> 250 25 -> 300 35 -> 30000 I made those numbers up. Before anyone brings it up, I know there are an infinite number of functions which will successfully work with the above data (if I didn't say that, I just know someone would jump on my toes for it). However, I want a program, perhaps using genetic programming or advanced B-spline/NURB curve type math to find an accurate (doesn't have to be a perfect) fit, and if at all possible, a small and simple function . The winning function can use addition, multiplication, exponentiation, double exponentiation, or basically anything it fancies to find the function. If the program uses genetic programming, then the GP's fitness function will take into account the simplicity/mathematical steps as a component of overall fitness. Ideally, the program would allow two or more inputs (rather than one) for each output, but I'd be grateful for something which just works with a single input and output as demonstrated in the two examples above. The program should be so simple that even a child could use it.","I've wanted this for years, but have never come across anything; a program for Windows to find the closest function to fit arbitrary data.
