But then, since $x$ is in $A$, but not in $B$, $x$ must be in $A-B$, which contradicts what I just discovered. Therefore, $x$ must be in $A∩B$. Suppose $x$ is in $A∩B$, then $x$ is in both $A$ and $B$. I know from this that $x$ cannot be a part of $A-B$ because that would imply that $x$ is part of $A$, but not part of $B$. Since $x$ is already part of $A$, but not part of $A-B$, it follows by definition that $x$ is in $A-(A-B)$. Would I be correct in saying this?

If I try to make an analogy between sets in general and the real numbers I would say that those definitions are explicitly made for partial orders, though I'm not sure and I don't know whether there are some sets with strict order to which the definitions apply. For example, there is a theorem that says that ""if $b$ is the least element of $B$ in some order on $A$ and $B\subseteq A$, then $b$ is the infimum of $B$"". In this case I can think of the set $A=\{1,2,3\}$ with the usual strict order $<$ on $\mathbb{R}$ and $B=\{2,3\}$. Then $\inf(B)=1$ and $\min(B)=2$. But if I take the usual partial order $\leq$ then $\min(B)=\inf(B)=2$. Here I'm using the next definition: Let $R$ be an ordering on $A$, and let $B\subseteq A$.

If I try to make an analogy between sets in general and the real numbers I would say that those definitions are explicitly made for partial orders, though I'm not sure and I don't know whether there are some sets with strict order to which the definitions apply. For example, there is a theorem that says that ""if $b$ is the least element of $B$ in some order on $A$ and $B\subseteq A$, then $b$ is the infimum of $B$"".
