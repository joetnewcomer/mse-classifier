Why is it that $\zeta(s)\neq0$ for $\operatorname{Re}(s)=0$ (that is, there are no non-trivial zeroes of the zeta function lying on this line)? My guess would be that this follows from the zeta functional equation: $$ \zeta(s)=2(2\pi)^{s-1}\sin\left(\frac{\pi s}{2}\right)\Gamma(1-s)\zeta(1-s) $$ and the symmetry of zeroes about the line $\operatorname{Re}(s)=1/2$. More precisely, I was aware that for $0<\operatorname{Re}(s)<1$, the functional equation shows us that if $s$ is a zero then $1-s$ is also a zero. I wondered then if we can further say that this holds for $0\leq\operatorname{Re}(s)\leq1$, where $s\neq1$? This would mean that, by reflection, as $\zeta(0)\neq0$, we can deduce that the line $\operatorname{Re}(s)=0$ contains no zeroes.

These are the correct values if we interpret the left sums as $\zeta(0)$ and $\zeta(-1)$, extended through analytic continuation.

Let $\eta: \mathbb{R}^+ \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a smooth, compactly supported, bounded cutoff function which is $1$ in a neighborhood of $0$. Corresponding to $(1)$ and $(2)$ are $$\begin{align} \sum_{n \geq 1} 1 \cdot \eta(n/N) &= -\frac{1}{2} + C_{\eta, 0} N + O\big(\frac{1}{N}\big) \tag{3} \\ \sum_{n \geq 1} n \cdot \eta(n/N) &= - \frac{1}{12} + C_{\eta, 1} N^2 + O\big(\frac{1}{N}\big), \tag{4} \end{align}$$ where $$ \zeta_{\eta, j} = \int_0^\infty x^j \eta(x) dx.$$ In the blog post, Exercise 2 concerns resolving an 'apparent inconsistency' in $(1)$ and $(2)$. Adding $(1)$ and $(2)$ (formally) shows that $\sum_{n \geq 1} (1+n) = -7/12$. Subtracting the integer $1$ from $(2)$ shows (formally) that $\sum_{n \geq 2} n = \sum_{n \geq 1} (1+n) = -13/12$. Working with the smoothed sums, adding $(3)$ and $(4)$ shows that $$ \sum_{n \geq 1} (1+n) \eta(n/N) = -\frac{7}{12} +  C_{\eta, 1} N^2 + C_{\eta, 0}N + O\big( \frac{1}{N} \big). \tag{5}$$ Subtracting $1$ (or rather $\eta(1/N)$, which is $1 + O(1/N)$ from a Taylor expansion) from $(4)$ shows that $$ \sum_{n \geq 2} n \eta(n/N) = \sum_{n \geq 1} (1+n) \eta\big( \frac{n+1}{N} \big) = -\frac{13}{12} + C_{\eta, 1} N^2 + O\big( \frac{1}{N} \big). \tag{6}$$ We see that the difference between $(5)$ and $(6)$ is entirely in the smoothing function $\eta(n/N)$ vs $\eta( \frac{n+1}{N} )$, and this is not apparent in the ""formal"" manipulation leading to the apparent inconsistency. My Question In his post, Terry Tao puts as Exercise 2 that one can use $(3)$ and the Taylor expansion for $\eta(\frac{n+1}{N})$ to derive $(6)$ from $(5)$. (Thus these are not only consistent but essentially equivalent). But I don't see how to do this. Initial thoughts towards a solution There are two ways that seem natural to expand $\eta$ in a Taylor series. We could use an expansion centered at $0$, leading to expressions of the form $$ \eta\left( \frac{n+1}{N} \right) = 1 + \eta'(0) \left( \frac{n+1}{N} \right) + \frac{\eta''(c)}{2} \left( \frac{n+1}{N} \right)^2, \qquad c \in (0, \tfrac{n+1}{N})$$ or perhaps several expansions centered at $n/N$, leading to expressions of the form $$ \eta \left( \frac{n+1}{N} \right) = \eta \left( \frac{n}{N} \right) + \eta' \left( \frac{n}{N} \right) \frac{1}{N} + \eta''(c) \frac{1}{N^2}, \qquad c \in (\tfrac{n}{N}, \tfrac{n+1}{N}).$$ The expansions centered at $n/N$ have many advantages. In the earlier Exercise 1 in the blog post, using Taylor expansions centered at $n/N$ led to an easy solution, so I suspect that this is the way to proceed. Further, as $\eta$ is compactly supported, we have $\eta''(c) = 0$ for large $c$. But using this Taylor expansion in the series in $(6)$, we find $$ \sum_{n \geq 1} (1+n) \eta \left( \frac{n+1}{N} \right) = \sum_{n \geq 1} (1+n) \Big[ \eta \left( \frac{n}{N} \right) + \eta' \left( \frac{n}{N} \right) \frac{1}{N} + \eta''(c_n) \frac{1}{N^2}\Big].$$ The first terms $$ \sum_{n \geq 1} (1+n) \eta \left( \frac{n}{N} \right)$$ are understood from $(3)$ and $(4)$ above. The error term summands are each $O(1/N)$, leading to an error term of size $O(1)$. (This indicates that one should use probably use one more term in the Taylor expansion, but that's not what I find to be the obstacle). The secondary term is what I find confusing. We want to understand $$ \sum_{n \geq 1} \frac{(1+n)}{N} \eta' \left( \frac{n}{N} \right),$$ but how are we to do this?

My question is: why the representation $\rho_{\ell}$ is rational? By criterion of Néron-Ogg-Shafarevich I understand that for all finite place $v$ such that $v$ not divides $\ell$ and $E$ has a good reduction at $v$, then $\rho_{\ell}$ is unramified. In particular the set of finite place of $K$ where $E$ has a bad reduction is finite and we denote it with $S_{\mathrm{bad}}$. So, if $S_{\ell}$ denote the set of finite place that not divide $\ell$, then for all finite place $v\notin S_{\mathrm{bad}}\cup S_{\ell}$ we have $\rho_{\ell}$ is unramified and $S_{\mathrm{bad}} \cup S_{\ell}$ is finite. But I don't understand why the coefficients of the polynomial $\mathrm{det}(1-F_{v,\rho_{\ell}}T)$ are rationals, where $T$ is an indeterminate and $F_{v,\rho_{\ell}}$ is the conjugacy class in $\mathrm{Aut}(V_{\ell})$ of $\rho_{\ell}(F_{w})$, $F_w$ the Frobenius element corresponding to a place $w$ of $\overline{K}$ extending $v$. I write a reasoning that I have done: If E has a good reduction at $v$ and $v \nmid \ell$ ,then I have the isomorphism $E[\ell](K) \simeq \widetilde{E}[\ell](k_v)$ where $k_v$ is the residue field of the completion of $K$ with respect to $v$. So the action of $\rho_{\ell}(F_w)$ on $E[\ell](K)$ correspond to the Frobenius endomorphism $\phi$ on $\widetilde{E}[\ell](k_v)$. Since $\mathrm{det}(1-F_{v,\rho_{\ell}})=\mathrm{det}(1-\rho_{\ell}(F_{w}))= 1-\mathrm{Tr}(\rho_{\ell}(F_{w}))T + \mathrm{det}(\rho_{\ell}(F_{w}))T^2$, can I deduce from my reasoning that $\mathrm{Tr}(\rho_{\ell}(F_{w}))=\mathrm{Tr}(\phi)$ and $\mathrm{det}(\rho_{\ell}(F_w))=\mathrm{det}(\phi)$? If it is true then we are done because the characteristic polynomial would be $1-\mathrm{Tr}(\phi)T+\mathrm{det}(\phi)T^2$ so would be independent from $\ell$ and it is known that $\mathrm{Tr}(\phi),\mathrm{det}(\phi)$ are integers (cf.

So the action of $\rho_{\ell}(F_w)$ on $E[\ell](K)$ correspond to the Frobenius endomorphism $\phi$ on $\widetilde{E}[\ell](k_v)$. Since $\mathrm{det}(1-F_{v,\rho_{\ell}})=\mathrm{det}(1-\rho_{\ell}(F_{w}))= 1-\mathrm{Tr}(\rho_{\ell}(F_{w}))T + \mathrm{det}(\rho_{\ell}(F_{w}))T^2$, can I deduce from my reasoning that $\mathrm{Tr}(\rho_{\ell}(F_{w}))=\mathrm{Tr}(\phi)$ and $\mathrm{det}(\rho_{\ell}(F_w))=\mathrm{det}(\phi)$? If it is true then we are done because the characteristic polynomial would be $1-\mathrm{Tr}(\phi)T+\mathrm{det}(\phi)T^2$ so would be independent from $\ell$ and it is known that $\mathrm{Tr}(\phi),\mathrm{det}(\phi)$ are integers (cf.

34,Characterization of ray class fields in terms of ramification alone,Characterization of ray class fields in terms of ramification alone,,"Some background:  when I first heard about ray class fields a year or so ago, I was told that the Hilbert class field of a global field $K$ is the maximal abelian extension of $K$ that is unramified at all (finite and infinite) primes of $K$, and that ray class fields are similar except allowing some ramification at finitely many primes.  This eventually crystallized in my head as a quasi-definition of ray class fields:  ""the ray class field of $K$ with modulus $\mathfrak m$ is the maximal abelian extension of $K$ that is unramified away from $\mathfrak m$, and is allowed to have some restricted ramification at primes dividing $\mathfrak m$.""  Now that I'm learning about ray class fields properly, I'm struggling to formulate precisely what this ""restricted ramification"" is, and I haven't found a reference that does so explicitly. The definition of ray class fields that I'm working with is summarized in section 2.9 of these wonderfully concise notes by Bjorn Poonen:  given a global field $K$ and a modulus $\mathfrak m$, we construct a particular open subgroup $U_{\mathfrak m}$ in the idele group $\mathbb A_K^{\times}$, and let $U_{\mathfrak m}'$ be its image in the quotient $\mathbb A_K^{\times}/K^{\times} = C_K$.  Then this is a finite-index open subgroup, so it corresponds to a finite-index open subgroup of $\widehat{C_K}$, isomorphic to $\mathrm{Gal}(K^{ab}/K)$ via the global Artin homomorphism, which fixes a finite extension $K_{\mathfrak m}/K$ that we call the ray class field. I would like the following to be true: if $\mathfrak{m} = \prod_{\mathfrak p} \mathfrak p^{a_p}$, the ray class field $K_\mathfrak{m}$ is the maximal abelian extension of $K$ that is unramified away from $\mathfrak m$, and that has trivial higher ramification group $G^{a_{\mathfrak p}}$ at finite primes $\mathfrak p$ dividing $\mathfrak m$. (Note the upper numbering on the ramification groups; I previously thought I had a counterexample to this, but I was using lower numbering.)  A friend and I have more or less worked out why this should be true:  from section 1.3 in Poonen's notes, the local Artin map for $K_{\mathfrak p}$ maps the filtration $\mathcal O_{K_{\mathfrak p}}^{\times} \supset 1 + \mathfrak p \supset 1 + \mathfrak p^2 \supset \cdots$ isomorphically onto the higher ramification groups $G^0 \supset G^1 \supset G^2 \supset \cdots$ in $\mathrm{Gal}(K_{\mathfrak p}^{ab}/K_{\mathfrak p})$, so (after using local-global compatibility) the fact that $U_{\mathfrak m}$ contains $1 + \mathfrak p^{a_{\mathfrak p}}$ should be exactly what we need to force the triviality of $G^{a_{\mathfrak p}}$ in $\mathrm{Gal}(K_{\mathfrak m}/K)$. Can someone confirm that this statement is correct, or fix it if not?","Some background:  when I first heard about ray class fields a year or so ago, I was told that the Hilbert class field of a global field $K$ is the maximal abelian extension of $K$ that is unramified at all (finite and infinite) primes of $K$, and that ray class fields are similar except allowing some ramification at finitely many primes.  This eventually crystallized in my head as a quasi-definition of ray class fields:  ""the ray class field of $K$ with modulus $\mathfrak m$ is the maximal abelian extension of $K$ that is unramified away from $\mathfrak m$, and is allowed to have some restricted ramification at primes dividing $\mathfrak m$.""

Equivalently, if the integers are $p$ and $q$, find the simple continued fraction expansion for $p/q$ that does not end in a 1.  Then take the numerator and denominator of the second-to-last partial quotient, with appropriate choice of signs.  You can check that this is minimal.

41,Is there formal name and proof for this formula/theorem (for now I'm calling it Orbital Collinearity Theorem)?,Is there formal name and proof for this formula/theorem (for now I'm calling it Orbital Collinearity Theorem)?,,"Suppose you are given a question that goes like this: Consider three planets that revolve   around a star on separate circular   orbits sharing the same orbital plane.   The first planet, A, takes 385 days to   complete its orbit. The second planet,   B, takes 814 days, while the third   planet, C, takes 1672 days. Suppose,   at one moment in time, the three   planets and their star are in one   straight line among each other (i.e.   they are collinear). Calculate how   many days the star and planets will be   collinear again. It looks like a simple question. Obvious enough, there are at least two trivial solutions for this kind of question. The first is the linear product of all the figures: 385 x 814 x 1672 = 523988080 days, while the second is their Least Common Multiple (LCM): LCM(385, 814, 1672) = 2165240 days. But surprisingly, it just takes $\frac{2165240}{39}$ days for the planets to be collinear again, albeit not at the same location. The question does not restrict the answer to be an integer, after all. My ""Orbital Collinearity Theorem"" :P By trial and error, I found out that the number of days for the planets to become collinear again can be calculated by the formula: $\dfrac{LCM(d_1, d_2, ... , d_n)}{M}$ where LCM(…) denotes Least Common Multiple and M is the largest integer for which the following modular congruence holds: $\frac{d_1}{G} \equiv \frac{d_2}{G} \equiv ... \equiv \frac{d_n}{G} \pmod{M}$ where G is the Greatest Common Divisor of the numbers of days the planets take to complete their respective orbits ($d_1$, $d_2$, ... , $d_n$). In other words, M is the largest integer that can give the same remainder when it divides each of $\frac{d_1}{G}$, $\frac{d_2}{G}$, ... , $\frac{d_n}{G}$. If there is no such M that is larger than 1 (since all integers will give remainder of 0 when divided by 1), the answer will be the LCM, which is very much expected. For 385, 814 and 1672, the value of M is 39: $GCD(385, 814, 1672) = 11$ $\frac{385}{11}=35$ and $35 \bmod 39 = 35$ $\frac{814}{11}=74$ and $74 \bmod 39 = 35$ $\frac{1672}{11}=152$ and $152 \bmod 39 = 35$ I don’t really have the proof/working since it is trial and error, but so far after testing with many samples the formula seems to hold for each case. So let’s check if after $\frac{2165240}{39}$ days, the three planets are collinear or not: Planet A: if it takes 385 days to complete its orbit, after $\frac{2165240}{39}$ days, it has traveled $\frac{2165240}{39} \cdot \frac{1}{385}=144 \frac{3080}{15015} = 144 \frac{8}{39}$ cycles Planet B: if it takes 814 days to complete its orbit, after $\frac{2165240}{39}$ days, it has traveled $\frac{2165240}{39} \cdot \frac{1}{814}=68 \frac{6512}{31746} = 68 \frac{8}{39}$ cycles Planet C: if it takes 1672 days to complete its orbit, after $\frac{2165240}{39}$ days, it has traveled $\frac{2165240}{39} \cdot \frac{1}{1672}=33 \frac{13376}{65208} = 33 \frac{8}{39}$ cycles It should be obvious that the numbers of cycles that the three planets have gone have the same fractional part, which is $\frac{8}{39}$. Meaning that they are all $\frac{8}{39}$ cycle into their current cycle (34th, 69th and 145th). Hence they all form the same angle from their last collinear position, thus they are collinear. Second sample: minute and hour hands The minute and hour hands overlap at   12 o’clock. At what time will the   hands overlap again? By considering the hands as planets revolving around the clock center, we can use the formula to solve it. First consider that minute hand takes 60 minutes to complete a cycle, while hour hand takes 720 minutes. LCM(60,720) = 720 and GCD(60, 720) = 60. That will give us M = 11. Thus it will take $\frac{720}{11} = 65.454545454545454545454545454545$ minutes for them to overlap again. And translating that into time gives us 1:05 and 27.27272727272 seconds. Correct. Moreover, this sample is an example of why we must divide the numbers by their GCD to get the M, a step that was not significant with the three planets question; because if we didn’t, M would be 60, giving us 12 minute as the answer. So, my real question is: Is there official name and proof for this formula/theorem? p/s: forgive the inappropriate tags since I don't have enough points to add new tags and there are no suitable tags among the existing ones. EDIT: OK, I've worked out the proof half-way but I still can't connect it to the last piece. I'm appending the half-proof here with hope that any of you guys can help me complete it: Let $L = LCM(d_1, d_2, ... , d_n)$. Then it's a given that L is the least number of days for the planets to be collinear again at the same position (i.e. all of them have revolves $c_1, c_2, ... , c_n$ integral number of cycles around the star). Proof by contradiction: suppose there exists another number $K < L$ for which the planets are collinear at the same position, then L must be a common multiple of $d_1, d_2, ... , d_n$, but $L$ is the least of their common multiples, hence contradiction.

Can anyone help?","Suppose you are given a question that goes like this: Consider three planets that revolve   around a star on separate circular   orbits sharing the same orbital plane.   The first planet, A, takes 385 days to   complete its orbit. The second planet,   B, takes 814 days, while the third   planet, C, takes 1672 days. Suppose,   at one moment in time, the three   planets and their star are in one   straight line among each other (i.e.   they are collinear). Calculate how   many days the star and planets will be   collinear again. It looks like a simple question. Obvious enough, there are at least two trivial solutions for this kind of question. The first is the linear product of all the figures: 385 x 814 x 1672 = 523988080 days, while the second is their Least Common Multiple (LCM): LCM(385, 814, 1672) = 2165240 days. But surprisingly, it just takes $\frac{2165240}{39}$ days for the planets to be collinear again, albeit not at the same location. The question does not restrict the answer to be an integer, after all. My ""Orbital Collinearity Theorem"" :P By trial and error, I found out that the number of days for the planets to become collinear again can be calculated by the formula: $\dfrac{LCM(d_1, d_2, ... , d_n)}{M}$ where LCM(…) denotes Least Common Multiple and M is the largest integer for which the following modular congruence holds: $\frac{d_1}{G} \equiv \frac{d_2}{G} \equiv ... \equiv \frac{d_n}{G} \pmod{M}$ where G is the Greatest Common Divisor of the numbers of days the planets take to complete their respective orbits ($d_1$, $d_2$, ... , $d_n$). In other words, M is the largest integer that can give the same remainder when it divides each of $\frac{d_1}{G}$, $\frac{d_2}{G}$, ... , $\frac{d_n}{G}$. If there is no such M that is larger than 1 (since all integers will give remainder of 0 when divided by 1), the answer will be the LCM, which is very much expected. For 385, 814 and 1672, the value of M is 39: $GCD(385, 814, 1672) = 11$ $\frac{385}{11}=35$ and $35 \bmod 39 = 35$ $\frac{814}{11}=74$ and $74 \bmod 39 = 35$ $\frac{1672}{11}=152$ and $152 \bmod 39 = 35$ I don’t really have the proof/working since it is trial and error, but so far after testing with many samples the formula seems to hold for each case. So let’s check if after $\frac{2165240}{39}$ days, the three planets are collinear or not: Planet A: if it takes 385 days to complete its orbit, after $\frac{2165240}{39}$ days, it has traveled $\frac{2165240}{39} \cdot \frac{1}{385}=144 \frac{3080}{15015} = 144 \frac{8}{39}$ cycles Planet B: if it takes 814 days to complete its orbit, after $\frac{2165240}{39}$ days, it has traveled $\frac{2165240}{39} \cdot \frac{1}{814}=68 \frac{6512}{31746} = 68 \frac{8}{39}$ cycles Planet C: if it takes 1672 days to complete its orbit, after $\frac{2165240}{39}$ days, it has traveled $\frac{2165240}{39} \cdot \frac{1}{1672}=33 \frac{13376}{65208} = 33 \frac{8}{39}$ cycles It should be obvious that the numbers of cycles that the three planets have gone have the same fractional part, which is $\frac{8}{39}$. Meaning that they are all $\frac{8}{39}$ cycle into their current cycle (34th, 69th and 145th). Hence they all form the same angle from their last collinear position, thus they are collinear. Second sample: minute and hour hands The minute and hour hands overlap at   12 o’clock. At what time will the   hands overlap again? By considering the hands as planets revolving around the clock center, we can use the formula to solve it. First consider that minute hand takes 60 minutes to complete a cycle, while hour hand takes 720 minutes. LCM(60,720) = 720 and GCD(60, 720) = 60. That will give us M = 11. Thus it will take $\frac{720}{11} = 65.454545454545454545454545454545$ minutes for them to overlap again. And translating that into time gives us 1:05 and 27.27272727272 seconds. Correct. Moreover, this sample is an example of why we must divide the numbers by their GCD to get the M, a step that was not significant with the three planets question; because if we didn’t, M would be 60, giving us 12 minute as the answer. So, my real question is: Is there official name and proof for this formula/theorem? p/s: forgive the inappropriate tags since I don't have enough points to add new tags and there are no suitable tags among the existing ones. EDIT: OK, I've worked out the proof half-way but I still can't connect it to the last piece. I'm appending the half-proof here with hope that any of you guys can help me complete it: Let $L = LCM(d_1, d_2, ... , d_n)$. Then it's a given that L is the least number of days for the planets to be collinear again at the same position (i.e. all of them have revolves $c_1, c_2, ... , c_n$ integral number of cycles around the star). Proof by contradiction: suppose there exists another number $K < L$ for which the planets are collinear at the same position, then L must be a common multiple of $d_1, d_2, ... , d_n$, but $L$ is the least of their common multiples, hence contradiction. Yet, we still have a possibility that L could be the M-th time the planets are collinear regardless of position. If such $M > 1$ exists, then the number of cycles that the planets have undergone after L days, $c_1, c_2, ... , c_n$, should have the same remainder if divided by M. Therefore, the following modular congruence must hold: $\frac{L}{d_1} \equiv \frac{L}{d_2} \equiv ... \equiv \frac{L}{d_n} \pmod{M}$ That's where I am now. I'm trying to connect the above congruence to: $\frac{d_1}{G} \equiv \frac{d_2}{G} \equiv ... \equiv \frac{d_n}{G} \pmod{M}$ It's trivial to do so with $d_1$ and $d_2$ only because $LCM(d_1,d_2)GCD(d_1,d_2) = d_1d_2$ but the relationship between LCM and GCD becomes less simplistic for more than two numbers.

I've to search for another polynomial... But I've little faith that such polynomial exists. In the end there is a ""explanation"" why one of the polynomials defined below don't work. We gonna do something very similar to what Beukers did to prove that $\zeta (2)$ is irrational. Sorry if is there any mistakes below. Here, $\pi = 4-\frac{4}{3}+\frac{4}{5}+\cdots$ We have the series: $\frac{1}{1+x^2} = 1-x^2+x^4-\cdots$ \begin{align} I_n = 4\int_0^1\frac{x^{2n}}{1+x^2}\:dx &= 4\int_0^1 x^{2n} \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}(-1)^{k}x^{2k} \: dx\\ &=4\int_0^1 \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}(-1)^{k}x^{2k+2n} \: dx\\ &=4\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}(-1)^{k} \frac{1}{2k+2n+1} \end{align} This shows that that for $n=0$ we have $I_0 = \pi$ . For $n>0$ we have a piece of $\pi$ (hehe). So we choose a polynomial with integers coefficients with all even powers: \begin{align} I_n = \frac{a_n\pi +b_n}{d_{2n}} \end{align} where $a_n,b_n$ are integers and $d_n$ is the less commom multiple of all consecutives natural numbers up to $2n$ . If it's possible to show that $d_{2n}I_n = a_n+b_n\pi \to 0$ as $n$ grows larger, that proves that $\pi$ is irrational. The shifted legendre polynomial is defined as below: $P_n(x) = \frac{1}{n!} \frac{d^n}{dx^n}(x^2-x)^n$ . The first $5$ are: They are nice because it's easy to integrate $n$ times from $0$ to $1$ , it makes the integral go to $0$ very fast and it's easy to find a upper bound for it.  I first learned about them in irrationality proofs made by Beukers, where he uses these polynomials to show that $\zeta(2)$ and even $\zeta(3)$ are irrational. He also proves that $\pi$ is irrational but uses a different approach to what we are trying here. The problem here is that these polynomial have odd power too, and that is not allowed here. So I wanted something like this: $2x^2-1$ $ 6x^4-6x^2+1$ $ 20x^6-30x^4+12x^2-1$ I also created a polynomial of the form: $\frac{1}{(2n)!}\frac{d^{2n}}{dx^{2n}}(x^4-x^2)^n$ , that satifies the property of having only even powers and integer coefficients, but this is terrible because it make the integral goes to infinity rather than $0$ . Probably because the coefficients are very large since we must differentiate some many times. I don't think we necessarily need to use a Legendre type polynomial. Maybe a polynomial with these properties mentioned to show that $\pi$ is irrational doesn't even exist. Any help will be appreciated. Below are defined polynomials, $Q_n(x)$ and $P_n(x)$ with degrees $(2n)$ and $(4n)$ respectively. $$Q_n(x) = \frac{d^{n}}{dx^{n}} \frac{(x-x^3)^{n}}{n!}$$ $Q_1(x) = 1-3x^2$ $Q_2(x) = 1 - 12 x^2 + 15 x^4$ $Q_3(x) = 1 - 30 x^2 + 105 x^4 - 84 x^6$ . Degree of $Q_n(x) = 2n$ . Using the identity, $$\int_a^b f^{(n)}(x)g(x) \:dx = (-1)^n\int_a^b f(x)g(x)^{(n)} \:dx $$ if $\left. f(x)g(x) \right|_a^b=0$ : $$\int_0^1 Q_n(x)/(1+x^2) = \frac{a_n \pi+b_n}{d_{2n}}.$$ $$ \int_0^1 Q_n(x)/(1+x^2) = (-1)^n \int_0^1 \frac{(x-x^3)^{n}}{n!} \frac{d^{n}}{dx^{n}} \frac{1}{1+x^2} $$ Another polynomial: $$P_n(x) = \frac{d^{2n-1}}{dx^{2n-1}} \frac{(x-x^3)^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)(2n-1)!} $$ $P_1(x) = x^2 - 5 x^4 + 7 x^6 - 3 x^8$ $P_2(x) = 2 x^2 - 35 x^4 + 168 x^6 - 330 x^8 + 286 x^{10} - 91 x^{12}$ $P_3(x) = 3 x^2 - 126 x^4 + 1386 x^6 - 6435 x^8 + 15015 x^{10} - 18564 x^{12} + 11628 x^{14} - 2907 x^{16} $ $$\int_0^1 P_1(x)/(1+x^2) = 4\pi - \frac{88}{7} \approx 0.005057$$ $$\int_0^1 P_2(x)/(1+x^2) =  228\pi -\frac{70912}{99} \approx -0.000296$$ $$\int_0^1 P_3(x)/(1+x^2) = 3(4672\pi -\frac{6678272}{455} ) \approx  0.0000046480$$ Degree of $ P_n(x) = 4n+4$ : $$\int_0^1 P_n(x)/(1+x^2) = \frac{a_n\pi+b_n}{d_{4n+4}} $$ $$ \int_0^1 P_n(x)/(1+x^2) = (-1)^n \int_0^1 \frac{(x^3-x)^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)(2n-1)!} \frac{d^{2n-1}}{dx^{2n-1}}\frac{1}{1+x^2}.  $$ Finding the $n$ th derivative of $1/(1+x^2)$ \begin{align} &\frac{1}{1+x^2} = \frac{i}{2(x+i)} - \frac{i}{2(x-i)}\\ &\frac{d^n}{dx^n} \frac{1}{1+x^2} = (-1)^n\frac{n!\:i}{2(x+i)^{n+1}} - (-1)^n \frac{n!\:i}{2(x-i)^{n+1}}\\ \end{align} Chosing $Q_n(x)$ , which has a degree $2n$ : \begin{align} I_n &=\int_0^1 Q_n(x)/(1+x^2)\\ &= (-1)^n \int_0^1 \frac{(x-x^3)^{n}}{n!} \frac{d^{n}}{dx^{n}} \frac{1}{1+x^2}\\ &=  (-1)^n \int_0^1 \frac{(x-x^3)^{n}}{n!}\left( (-1)^n\frac{n!\:i}{2(x+i)^{n+1}}- (-1)^n \frac{n!\:i}{2(x-i)^{n+1}} \right) \end{align} Multiplying by $i$ and taking the absolute value: \begin{align} |iI_n| = |I_n|  &=\left| (-1)^n \int_0^1 \frac{(x-x^3)^{n}}{n!}\left( (-1)^{n+1}\frac{n!}{2(x+i)^{n+1}} - (-1)^{n+1} \frac{n!}{2(x-i)^{n+1}} \right) \right|\\ &=\int_0^1 \frac{(x-x^3)^{n}}{n!}\left( \frac{n!}{2(x+i)^{n+1}} - \frac{n!}{2(x-i)^{n+1}} \right) \\ &=\int_0^1 {(x-x^3)^{n}}\left( \frac{1}{2(x+i)^{n+1}} - \frac{1}{2(x-i)^{n+1}} \right). \\ \end{align} Removing the $i$ above: \begin{align} \frac{1}{2(x+i)^{n+1}} - \frac{1}{2(x-i)^{n+1}} =\frac{(x-i)^{n+1} -(x+i)^{n+1}}{2(1+x^2)} \end{align} writing in polar form $x+i = |z|e^{i\theta}:$ \begin{align} \frac{(x-i)^{n+1} -(x+i)^{n+1}}{2(1+x^2)} &= \frac{(e^{-i\theta})^{n+1} - (e^{i\theta})^{n+1}} {|z|^{n+1}}\\ &=\frac{\cosh[ (n+1) \theta ] } {|z|^{n+1}}\\ &=\frac{\cosh[ (n+1) \arctan 1/x ] } {(\sqrt{1+x^2})^{n+1}}\: \text{because $x>0$}. \end{align} \begin{align} |I_n| &= \int_0^1 {(x-x^3)^{n}} \frac{\cosh[ (n+1) \arctan 1/x ] } {(\sqrt{1+x^2})^{n+1}}\\ &= \int_0^1 \frac{(x-x^3)^{n}} {(\sqrt{1+x^2})^{n+1}} \frac{1}{2}  \left( \frac{1}{e^{(n+1)\arctan 1/x}} + e^{(n+1)\arctan 1/x} \right)\\ &= \int_0^1 \left( \frac{(x-x^3)}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right)^n \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \left( \frac{1} { {(e^{\arctan 1/x})}^n  } \frac{1}{e^{\arctan 1/x}} + {(e^{\arctan 1/x})}^n e^{\arctan 1/x} \right)  \\ &= \int_0^1 \left( \frac{x-x^3}{e^{\arctan 1/x}\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right)^n  \frac{1}{e^{\arctan 1/x}\sqrt{1+x^2}} +  \left( \frac{(x-x^3)(e^{\arctan 1/x})}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right)^n \frac{e^{\arctan 1/x}}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \end{align} The maximum of $$\left( \frac{(x-x^3)(e^{\arctan 1/x})}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right)^n$$ is $\approx 1.03^n$ (thanks wolfram) which implies that $Q_n(x)$ can't be used for proving the irrationality of $\pi$ . $P_n(x)$ goes to zero and we can do all this work again, but what will happen is that maximum of $P_n(x)$ multiplied by the $LCM$ of ${1,2,...,4n}$ will be greater than $1$ , because of the degree $4n$ .

That's not all! By a very wonderful proposition of  \begin{eqnarray*} (m+n)^p\equiv{m^p+n^p}\ \text{( mod $p$ ), where $p$ is prime} \end{eqnarray*} and similar thinking from the $n=3$ case we can generalize this idea of near misses for exponents that are odd primes.

More precisely, they showed that there exist positive constants $c$ and $C$ such that for all sufficiently large numbers N, every even number less than N is the sum of two primes, with at most $C N^{1-c}$ exceptions. In particular, the set of even integers which are not the sum of two primes has density zero. Has the Goldbach conjecture been proven for any specific classes on $n$? By exhautive search,it has been proven for $4\leq n \leq 10^{18},$ but my question is whether it has been proven for eg primorial multiples, where $G(n)$ generally reaches it's maximum.

It turns out that this definition is equivalent to $$\sigma(n)=\prod_{\substack{p^\alpha||n\\p\in\mathbb{P}}}\frac{p^{\alpha+1}-1}{p-1}\tag{1}$$ We can extend this function to the non-zero integers by simply neglecting the negative divisors. What we actually do, mathematically, is making the factorization unique - this is possible only if we have one unit. As before, we could actually use the expression $(1)$ to define $\sigma$. Now, I wonder how the divisor function could be naturally extended to the non-zero complex integers $\mathbb{Z}[i]^*$. There are several obvious candidates, but all of them fail in one way or another. I will describe the perhaps most natural. Were we to sum over all divisors of a complex integer $z$, it is obvious that the divisors would cancel and the sum would be zero; this was also the case for the negative integers. We avoided this by finding a unique factorization of every integer. This time, the same idea cannot be applied directly, but what we can do is write any non-zero complex integer as the product of complex primes in the first quadrant of the complex plane and a unit. We then shave off the unit, and use the expression $(1)$ for the complex prime powers; that is, $$\sigma(z)=\prod_{p^\alpha||z}\frac{p^{\alpha+1}-1}{p-1}\tag{2},$$ where each $p$ is a complex prime lying in the first quadrant. Unfortunately, this function will fail to correspond to the original for real integers; what is more, it is even complex-valued there. I find this drawback important, as it means that this extended function cannot directly be used to find new properties of the classical one (which is often the case for complex extension). One might wonder if there is any use of a invented function like this. However, there is also a good part; the function is still multiplicative and it satisfies the inequality $|\sigma(z)|\ge z$.

72,What are the densities of branches of the euclidean tree?,What are the densities of branches of the euclidean tree?,,"The Euclidean algorithm shows how all coprime pairs of positive integers can be uniquely obtained from the pair $(1,1)$ by applying the two operations $(a,b) \to (a+b,b)$ and $(a,b) \to (a,a+b)$. (or speaking with rationals, all the positive rationals $x=b/a$ can be obtained from $1$ by applying the two operations $x \to x/(x+1)$ and $x \to x+1$). Furthermore, we know that the natural density of coprime pairs among the pairs of positive integers is $6/\pi^2$.

73,Asymptotic FLT $\implies$FLT using ABC Conjecture,Asymptotic FLT FLT using ABC Conjecture,\implies,"Edit: I'm beginning to suspect I either misread the sources or perhaps something wasn't stated, but it's my guess now that there is no nontrivial way of showing the ABC conjecture implies Fermat's Last Theorem in full. Original: If we assume the ABC conjecture, then one can prove with relative ease that $x^n+y^n=z^n$ possibly has solutions in positive integers only for $n< n_0$, where $n_0$ is some finite number. This is the ""Asymptotic Fermat's Last Theorem."" My question is, does this somehow imply with further calculations that the full Fermat's Last Theorem follows? Indeed I've read that ABC conjecture implies the full FLT and I thought it would follow from the asymptotic case, again bootstrapping the ABC conjecture. The proof for the asymptotic case goes as follows: Recall that the ABC conjecture states that for any $\epsilon>0$, there exists an $N(\epsilon)>0$ such that for all nonnegative $a,b,c$ relatively prime with $a+b=c$, one has $c\leq N(\epsilon)\mbox{rad}(abc)^{1+\epsilon}$. Let $x^n+y^n=z^n$, where $x,y,z$ are relatively prime, so that $\mbox{rad}(x^ny^nz^n)=\mbox{rad}(xyz)\leq xyz\leq z^3$. Supposing $n\geq 3$, we get that $z\geq 3$, so invoking the ABC conjecture with $\epsilon=1$ and $K:=\max(1,N(1))$, we get $$z^n\leq N(\epsilon)\mbox{rad}(x^ny^nz^n)<Kz^6$$ so $$n<6+\frac{\log K}{\log z}\leq 6+\frac{\log K}{\log 3}=:n_0$$ and we are done. Is there a way to push this toward the full proof of FLT? I feel like we would need to consider the reformulation of the ABC conjecture, that for any $\epsilon>0$, the set of exceptions $c>\mbox{rad}(abc)$ is finite, so that there is some $m$ such that $c\leq (abc)^{m}$ (for every $a+b=c$) and therefore FLT holds for every integer that is at least $3m$. Is seems impossible to suggest that $m=1$ since there are plenty of counterexamples of triples $(a,b,c)$ for which this is false. Perhaps one would need to show no counterexamples exist when $a,b,c$ satisfy $a^3+b^3=c^3$?","Edit: I'm beginning to suspect I either misread the sources or perhaps something wasn't stated, but it's my guess now that there is no nontrivial way of showing the ABC conjecture implies Fermat's Last Theorem in full.

95,Convergence of infinite products flaw in this derivation of Euler product formula?,Convergence of infinite products flaw in this derivation of Euler product formula?,,"I am trying to write a derivation of the Euler product formula in a way that is accessible to younger students and those not mathematically trained at university. Because of this I am starting from the simplest starting point that I can, and use the simplest possible steps in the derivation. I arrive at the following which I know is wrong as it is missing the exponent $s>1$ to ensure convergence. $$ \prod_{p}\frac{1}{(1-\frac{1}{p})}=\sum_{n}\frac{1}{n} $$ My question is to ask where I am introducing the error in the following simple derivation. Step 1 Start with a familiar series, valid for $|x| < 1$ . $$ \frac{1}{(1-x)}=1+x+x^{2}+x^{3}+\ldots $$ We're interested in primes, and might be tempted to set $x$ to a prime $p$ , but we can't because $|x|$ needs to be $<1$ . Let's try $\frac{1}{p}$ which is always $<1$ . $$ \frac{1}{(1-\frac{1}{p})}=1+\frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{p^{2}}+\frac{1}{p^{3}}+\ldots $$ This series converges to a finite value. Step 2 Let's now pick two different primes $p_1$ and $p_2$ , and multiply the analogous series for each. $$ \frac{1}{(1-\frac{1}{p_{1}})}\cdot\frac{1}{(1-\frac{1}{p_{2}})}=\left(1+\frac{1}{p_{1}}+\frac{1}{p_{1}^{2}}+\ldots\right)\cdot\left(1+\frac{1}{p_{2}}+\frac{1}{p_{2}^{2}}+\ldots\right) $$ I don't think there is a problem here. We are multiplying two infinite series, each one known to converge to a finite value. Am I wrong? Step 3 Now we extend from two primes, $p_1$ and $p_2$ , to all primes $p_i$ . $$ \prod_{p_{i}}\frac{1}{(1-\frac{1}{p_{i}})}=\prod_{p_{i}}\left(1+\frac{1}{p_{i}}+\frac{1}{p_{i}^{2}}+\ldots\right) $$ I think this is the flaw in my derivation. We have an infinite product of finite values. Each factor $\frac{1}{(1-\frac{1}{p_{i}})}$ is $>1$ so the infinite product looks like it might not converge. However each factor tends to $\rightarrow 1$ as $i \rightarrow \infty$ . This suggests the infinite product is ok. Am I wrong? Step 4 If we multiply out those brackets, each of the form $\left(1+\frac{1}{p_{i}}+\frac{1}{p_{i}^{2}}+\ldots\right)$ , we will obtain terms which are all combinations of primes, in all the combinations of powers for each prime. $$ \prod_{p_{i}}\left(1+\frac{1}{p_{i}}+\frac{1}{p_{i}^{2}}+\ldots\right) = 1 + \frac{1}{p_1} + \frac{1}{p_2} + \ldots + \frac{1}{p_1 p_2} + \frac{1}{p_1 p_3} + \ldots + \frac{1}{p_1^2} + \frac{1}{p_2^2} + \ldots  $$ Importantly, each combination occurs only once. Step 5 The fundamental theorem of arithmetic tells us that each integer can be written as a unique product of primes. This means that each integer is represented in the terms we arrived at in the previous step. Because each combination of primes occurs only once, each integer is represented only once. That leads us to the Euler product formula. $$ \boxed{\prod_{p}\frac{1}{(1-\frac{1}{p})}=\sum_{n}\frac{1}{n}} $$ Discussion If my suspicion is correct that the error is in the infinite product because it doesn't converge, how does changing $p$ for $p^s$ for $s>1$ help?","I am trying to write a derivation of the Euler product formula in a way that is accessible to younger students and those not mathematically trained at university.
