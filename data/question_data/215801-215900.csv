1,Finding the center of mass of a hollow hemisphere,Finding the center of mass of a hollow hemisphere,,"Let there be hollow hemisphere (there is no solid bottom) with radius $r$ . Find the center of mass of the hollow hemisphere, assuming the mass distribution is uniform. My attempt: Let there be a hollow hemisphere centered at $(0,0,0)$ with the bottom plane of the hemisphere resting on the $x-z$ plane. Let it's total mass be M. By symmetry the center of mass of the hemisphere must lie on the $y$ axis. Now let us divide the hemisphere into thin rings, starting from the bottom. Let $dA$ be the area of a thin ring, where is the center of mass is the ring's center. Also, let $dM$ be the mass of the ring. From the diagram it is clear that: $$x^2+r^2=R^2$$ $$dA=2\pi r\cdot dx \implies dA = 2\pi\cdot \sqrt{R^2-x^2}\cdot dx$$ Hence, $dM=\frac{M}{2\pi R^2} \cdot dA=\frac{M}{R^2} \cdot \sqrt{R^2-x^2} \cdot dx$ $$y_{com}=\frac{1}{M} \cdot \int dm \cdot x=\frac{1}{R^2}\int_0^Rx \cdot \sqrt{R^2-x^2} \cdot dx $$ Evaluating this gives $y_{com} = R/3$ , which is proven wrong by a quick google search. The method shown here uses an angle subtended by a small surface area on a ring, which after computation does give the correct answer of $R/2$ . My question is, which step am I doing wrong? Why is the answer coming one way but not the other? I did the same thing with a cone, and the same thing happened, if I approximated a hollow cone as a series of thin hollow cylinders on top of each other, I get the incorrect answer, but with the angle approach, it gives the correct answer. When is an approximation considered ""good enough"" mathematically? I would really appreciate an explanation.","Let there be hollow hemisphere (there is no solid bottom) with radius .

7,What is the minimum value of $8 \cos^2 x + 18 \sec^2 x$?,What is the minimum value of ?,8 \cos^2 x + 18 \sec^2 x,"As per me the answer should be $26$ . But when we apply AM-GM inequality it gives $24$ as the least value but as per the graph 24 can never come. What I think is that in AM-GM, it gives $8 \cos^2 x = 18 \sec^2 x$ which gives $\cos x > 1$ which is not possible and because of this, AM-GM is giving a wrong minimum value. If we had $18 \cos^2 x + 8 \sec^2 x$ , then AM-GM would have worked and $24$ would be a right answer since $18 \cos^2 x = 8 \sec^2 x$ , which gives $\cos x < 1$ which is true. Is this reason correct?","As per me the answer should be . But when we apply AM-GM inequality it gives as the least value but as per the graph 24 can never come.

22,Finding area ratios in triangle cut by circle,Finding area ratios in triangle cut by circle,,"This is another one of those problems that was a brain teaser, and I am curious about how to do this in a more elegant way. Given: I want to find the ratio of the blue area to the red one. Initially I had thought the way to do it was use the equation of a circle $x^{2}+y^{2} = 16$ (since we know the radius) and see where it intersects the line $y=\frac{3}{4}x+3$ (I know I could place the point A at the origin too, but I thought dispensing with the coordinates of the center of the circle would be simpler). Anyhow, the idea I had was to subtract the area under the triangle from the circle first, and then do he same with the whole triangle by just subtracting integrals with the limits at the intersection points. So, for the blue area, I would first find where point D is: $$x^2 +y^2 =16 \text{ and substituting } y = \frac{3}{4}x+3$$ $$(\frac{3}{4}x+3)^{2} + x^2 = 16 \rightarrow \frac{9}{16}x^{2}+\frac{9}{2}x+9+x^2=16$$ $$\frac{25}{16}x^{2} + \frac{9}{2}x +9 = 16 \rightarrow \frac{25}{16}x^{2} + \frac{9}{2}x -7 = 0$$ Which is a perfectly good quadratic and we can solve that and I get an intersection point of $(1.12,3.84)$ . Then I can integrate my circle within those limits, subtracting the triangle underneath (which would be described by the linear equation) $$\int_{-4}^{1.12}(16-x^2)^{1/2}dx-\int_{-4}^{1.12}\frac{3}{4}x+3dx $$ That first integral is ugly, and I have to say I am not sure how to approach it because I don't know the angle to the point D to set the limits for the trig substitution that I ordinarily might try. More to the point, what was bothering me was that there has to be a more elegant method for this. I suspect there is some geometric rule or procedure that I am missing here; I tried, for example, dropping a line segment OD which makes for an isosceles triangle AOD and then I could use the relevant formulas for the area of a circle segment. But here again I don't know the angle involved. I could certainly find the angles by, for example, making a line segment OD and knowing that the angle A is $\sin^{-1}(0.6)$ because the triangle is a 3-4-5. That angle would get me both angles AOD and COD, and I could use trig functions to derive the lengths of various triangle sides, which would enable me to find the areas I want.

Find the maximum value of the sum $$S = \sum_{r=1}^n \sum_{m=1}^n s_rs_m \cos \frac{2\pi (r - m)}{n}$$ It may be worth noting that there is a recurrance relation, which helps slightly. Defining $$S(t) = \sum_{r=1}^t \sum_{m=1}^t s_rs_m\cos\frac{2\pi(r-m)}n,$$ we obtain that $$S(t+1) = S(t) + s_{t+1}^2 + 2s_{t+1} \sum_{m=1}^t s_r\cos\frac{2\pi(t+1-m)}n.$$ In the special case that each $s_r = s$ , I found that the difference $S(t+1) - S(t) < 0$ when $$s^2\left(1 + 2\sum_{m=1}^t \cos\frac{2\pi (t+1-m)}n \right) \leq 0,$$ or when $$\sum_{m=1}^t \cos\frac{2\pi (t+1-m)}n = \sum_{m=1}^t \cos\frac{2\pi m}n \leq -\frac12,$$ which through a quick python program and some experimental values, I've found to hold true (without proof) when $\lceil n/2 \rceil < t \leq n$ . From this, I'm pretty sure the maximal sum $S$ when each $s_r \in \{s,0\}$ occurs when $$s_r = \begin{cases} s & 1 \leq r \leq \lceil n/2 \rceil, \\ 0 & \text{otherwise}. \end{cases}$$ In the general case, $S(t+1) - S(t) < 0$ would occur when $$\sum_{m=1}^t s_m\cos\frac{2\pi(t-m)}n < -\frac{s_{t+1}}2,$$ however this sum is trickier to bound due to the weights attached to the cosine sum. Edit : Alright, I've tried some of the suggestions, particularly the one by dezdichado, which suggested $$S = \left( \sum_{r=1}^n s_r \cos\frac{2\pi r}n \right)^2 + \left( \sum_{r=1}^n s_r \sin\frac{2\pi r}n \right)^2, \tag{a}$$ which makes the problem, interestingly, about attempting to maximize the magnitude of the sum of multiples of $n$ th roots of unity: $$S = \left| \sum_{r=1}^n s_r e^{2\pi i r/n} \right|^2, \tag{b}$$ where each $0 \leq s_r \leq s$ , for some real $s \geq 1$ . However, trying to bound the sum in the form (a) is proving troublesome, especially since there are two different sums. I have a feeling there is some way to bound $S$ in the form (b), but I don't really see anyway to do it. Kinda given up on the problem, so any hints and solutions welcome!","For a real and an integer , define real in for .

Here are my proofs that $\sin \left(\dfrac{\pi}{2}-x\right)=\cos\left(x\right).$ First, angle addition says that $\sin\left( \dfrac{\pi}{2}-x\right)=\sin\dfrac{\pi}{2}\cos x-\sin x\cos\dfrac{\pi}{2}=(1)\cos x - \sin x (0) = \cos x.$ Second, a geometric proof. Consider a right triangle. We may assume WLOG that the hypotenuse is $1$ . If not, then multiply all sides by the multiplicative inverse of the hypotenuse so that it is (the triangle obtained is similar, so the angles are preserved). Let one of the acute angles be $\alpha$ . Then the side adjacent to that angle has length $\cos \alpha$ . Now consider the angle $\dfrac{\pi}{2} - \alpha$ . The side opposite to this angle has length $\cos \alpha$ . But since $\sin x = \dfrac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}, \sin\left(\dfrac{\pi}{2} - \alpha\right)=\cos \alpha.$ Now, if $\alpha$ is not acute, we may add an integer multiple of $2\pi$ to $\alpha$ so that it is, without changing the value of $\sin \alpha$ since $\sin x$ is $2\pi$ periodic. Now, since $0<x < \dfrac{\pi}{2}, \sin x,\cos x \in (0, 1)\Rightarrow \dfrac{3}{2}\sin x, \dfrac{3}{2}\cos x \in (0,\dfrac{3}{2})\subseteq (0,\dfrac{\pi}{2})$ . So, using this fact, we have that $\cos \left(\dfrac{3}{2}\cos x\right)=\sin \left(\dfrac{3}{2}\sin x\right)\Leftrightarrow\dfrac{3}{2}\cos x+\dfrac{3}{2}\sin x = \dfrac{\pi}{2}.$ Using the fact that $\sin x = \sqrt{1-\cos ^2 x},$ I get that $\sin x = \dfrac{\frac{2\pi}{3}\pm \frac{2}{3}\sqrt{18-\pi^2}}{4},$ but I'm not sure how to use this to get $\sin \,(2x)$ into the desired form.","Let If is such that then express in the form where are integers.

Nevertheless I didn't manage to find a concise closed formula for $a^{(n)}_k(\alpha)$ , $\alpha = 0,\pi/n$ . Question 1: Can someone give a closed formula for $a^{(n)}_k(\alpha)$ , $\alpha = 0,\pi/n$ ? (I assume this formula will only contain $k^{-2}$ terms. So it's more about the period length, positions of the zeros, and the alternation of the signs. Note that the smallest $k>1$ with $a^{(n)}_k, b^{(n)}_k \neq 0$ is just $k = n-1$ , see the gallery below.) Three other questions I have: Question 2: How does $a^{(n)}_k(\alpha)$ look like for arbitrary rotation angles – not just $\alpha = \pi/n$ ?

Since the line has a positive slope, I can picture a positive acute angle that the line would make with the $x$ -axis, so $22.6^\circ$ makes sense.

A simple way to express this is: $\left\Vert (p - c) \times n \right\Vert_2 = r$ To make my life sane, I have added the following requirements that ought to reduce my problem space to five free variables: $n^T \; n = 1$ $c^T \; n = 0$ After a bunch of steps (including using orthogonal vectors to $n$ to do projections and avoid a cross product), I found that I can express it as: $n^T \; P \; n + 2 \; c^T p + r ^2 - c^T c - 1 = 0$ where $P = p\; p^T = \left[\begin{array}{c c c} p_x^2 & p_x p_y & p_x p_z \\ p_x p_y & p_y^2 & p_y p_z \\ p_x p_z & p_y p_z & p_z^2 \end{array}\right]$ In theory, with only five free variables, I should be able to use five points to recover the free variables. But I had another thought:  After doing a partial Gaussian elimination (with five input points), I can produce a single symmetric matrix $M$ such that: $n^T \; M \; n = 0$. Now the question still remains - how do I solve for $n$?  I tried to diagonalize $M$ via eigenvalues/vectors to develop a solution for $n$, but I couldn't figure out how to transform the solution space back to $n$ without complications. Any advice?  I'm sure I probably need at least two $M$ matrices, along with the earlier assumption ($n^T \; n = 1$) to recover $n$, but I'm just plain lost.  It's been way too long since I took linear algebra.

The Professor and most of the class determined that to solve for side AB you would simply use the law of sines: Problem: A land developer wants to find the distance across a small lake in the middle of his proposed development. The bearing from A to B is N15°W. The developer leaves point A and travels 66 yards perpendicular to AB to point C. The bearing from C to point B is N75°W. Determine the distance, AB, across the small lake. Round distance to nearest yard.
