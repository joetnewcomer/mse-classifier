2,To each representation on $\mathbb{C}^n $ corresponds a representation on $\mathbb{R}^{2n} $,To each representation on  corresponds a representation on,\mathbb{C}^n  \mathbb{R}^{2n} ,"So, I am supposed to show that to each representation $\rho$ of a group $G$ on $\mathbb{C}^n $ corresponds a representation $\tilde{\rho}$ , of the same group $G$ , on $\mathbb{R}^{2n} $ . Additionally: Show that, if the representation $(\tilde{\rho},\mathbb{R}^{2n}) $ is irreducible, then the representation $(\rho,\mathbb{C}^{n} )$ is also irreducible. My thinking: For the first part: Suppose we have the following map: $\phi(z):\mathbb{C}^{n}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{2n}, \space \phi(z)= \begin{bmatrix}     Re(z)   \\     Im(z)    \\ \end{bmatrix}$ . This is obviously a bijection, additionally it follows that $\phi(z_1+z_2)=\phi(z_1)+\phi(z_2)$ . My idea then was to find a bijection $\eta$ between the sets $\rho(g)$ and $\tilde{\rho}(g)$ , for $g \in G$ . And this is what I came up with (I'll denote $\rho(g)$ as $\rho_g$ ): $$\eta:\mathbb{R}^{2n}\rightarrow \mathbb{C}^{n}, \space \eta:\space \tilde{\rho}_g(.)\rightarrow \phi^{-1}(\tilde{\rho}_g(\phi(.)))=\rho_g(.)$$ The map $\rho_g (.)=\phi^{-1}(\tilde{\rho}_g(\phi(.)))$ is clearly $\mathbb{C}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^{n}$ , it is also a bijection and it follows that $\rho_g(z_1z_2)=\rho_g(z_1)\rho_g(z_2)$ , all together meaning that $\rho_g $ is a representation of $G$ on $\mathbb{C}^{n}$ . I have therefore shown that to each representation $(\tilde{\rho},\mathbb{R}^{2n})$ corresponds a representation $(\rho,\mathbb{C}^{n})$ , via $\eta$ . For the second part: (proof by contradiction) Irreducible means that for $\tilde{\rho}$ there is no (non-trivial) invariant subspace in $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ . Lets take a (non-trivial) subset $R\subset \mathbb{R}^{2n}$ , so that for a subset $W \subset \mathbb{C}^{n}: \space$ $\phi(W)=R$ and $\phi^{-1}(R)=W$ . We suppose that the opposite holds ( $\rho$ is reducible): that $W$ is some non-trivial  invariant subset for $(\rho,\mathbb{C}^{n} )$ . This means that $\rho_g(W) \subset W$ for each $g \in G$ . But since $\phi^{-1}(\tilde{\rho}_g(\phi(W)))=\rho_g(W) \subset W$ , it follows that $\tilde{\rho}(\phi(W))\subset R $ and using $\phi(W)=R$ , we get that $\tilde{\rho}(R)\subset R$ . So we found a (non-trivial) invariant subspace for $\tilde{\rho}$ , but this contradicts the above statements that $\tilde{\rho}$ is irreducible, therefore $\rho$ must be irreducible. My question: Is my thinking correct? Could you please suggest some improvements or maybe show a different, more compact way to prove the above statements.","So, I am supposed to show that to each representation of a group on corresponds a representation , of the same group , on .

3,Fundamental domain for congruence subgroup.,Fundamental domain for congruence subgroup.,,"Let $\Gamma$ be a congruence subgroup of the modular group $\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z})$ . Let $R$ be coset representatives of the quotient $\Gamma\setminus\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z})$ and let $\mathcal{D}$ be the standard fundamental domain for $\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z})$ (actually we could consider any fundamental domain for $\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z})$ ). I want to prove that $$\mathcal{D}_{\Gamma}=\bigcup_{\gamma\in R}\gamma\mathcal{D}$$ is a fundamental domain for the congruence subgroup $\Gamma$ , i.e. that for every $z$ in the upper complex half-plane $\mathbb{H}$ there exists $\gamma\in\Gamma$ such that $\gamma z\in\mathcal{D}_{\Gamma}$ and also that if $z,\gamma z\in\mathcal{D}_{\Gamma}^{\circ}$ then this $\gamma$ is unique up to multiplication by an element of $\Gamma\cap\{\pm I\}$ , where $I$ is the identity matrix. It is simple to prove the existence of $\gamma\in\Gamma$ . I have a problem showing the ""uniqueness"". Here is my proof: Consider $z\in\mathbb{H}$ and $\gamma_{1},\gamma_{2}\in\Gamma$ such that $\gamma_{1}z,\gamma_{2}z\in\mathcal{D}_{\Gamma}^{\circ}$ . This implies that there exist $\gamma_{1}',\gamma_{2}'\in R$ and $z_{1},z_{2}\in\mathcal{D}$ such that $\gamma_{1}z=\gamma_{1}'z_{1}$ and $\gamma_{2}z=\gamma_{2}'z_{2}$ . Therefore, \begin{equation*}     \gamma_{1}^{-1}\gamma_{1}'z_{1}=z=\gamma_{2}^{-1}\gamma_{2}'z_{2}. \end{equation*} Set $w_{1}=\gamma_{1}'z_{1}\in\mathcal{D}_{\Gamma}^{\circ}$ , $w_{2}=\gamma_{2}'z_{2}\in\mathcal{D}_{\Gamma}^{\circ}$ , and $\gamma=\gamma_{1}\gamma_{2}^{-1}$ . Then, we have that $w_{1}=\gamma w_{2}$ . We claim that $\gamma=I$ . Indeed, since $w_{1}\in\mathcal{D}_{\Gamma}^{\circ}$ , there exists $\epsilon>0$ such that $B_{\epsilon}(z)\subseteq\mathcal{D}_{\Gamma}^{\circ}$ . $B_{\epsilon}(z)$ intersects some translations of $\mathcal{D}$ in $\mathcal{D}_{\Gamma}$ . Let $R'$ be the set of representatives of such translations, i.e. $S\subseteq R$ and \begin{equation*}     \delta\in S\iff B_{\epsilon}(z)\cap \delta \mathcal{D}\neq\emptyset. \end{equation*} Now we have that $\gamma z\in\mathcal{D}_{\Gamma}^{\circ}$ and so there exists $\delta\in R$ such that $\gamma B_{\epsilon}(z)\cap \delta \mathcal{D}\neq \emptyset$ . This implies that \begin{equation*}     B_{\epsilon}(z)\cap\gamma^{-1}\delta\mathcal{D}\neq\emptyset \end{equation*} and so $\gamma^{-1}\delta=\delta'$ for some $\delta'\in R'$ . Hence, \begin{equation*}     \Gamma \delta'=\Gamma\gamma^{-1}\delta=\Gamma\delta \end{equation*} and so $\delta=\delta'$ , which implies that $\gamma=I$ . My problems is the following: First, the above proof works if $\gamma B_{\epsilon}(z)=B_{\epsilon}(\gamma z)$ , which I suspect holds but I cannot prove, or at least $B_{\epsilon}(\gamma z)\subseteq \gamma B_{\epsilon}(z)$ .

4,$S_n$ is a group,is a group,S_n,"This is an extremely simple fact, but I want to make sure that the assertions I am making are valid. In particular, I assert several times that a function is a permutation if and only if it is a bijection from a finite set to itself. If this is fine, I believe my arguments below are likely fine. I cannot think of a good counterexample to this. There are four requirements we need to verify: closed under product operations, associative, has an identity, and closed under inverses. Closed under product operation : An element of $S_n$ is a permutation of the elements $1, 2, \ldots, n$ . This is a bijection $\alpha: \{1, 2, \ldots, n\} \to \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ . A composition of these bijections, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ , is another bijection from $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ to $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ , and hnce $\alpha \beta$ is another permutation of the elements $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ . Associativity. An element of $S_n$ is a permutation, i.e., a function from a set to itself, and function composition can easily be shown to be associative. For simplicity, take $f, g, h$ to be well-defined functions that map $A$ to $A$ . For any $a \in A$ , we have: $$((f \circ g) \circ h)(a) = (f \circ g)(h(a)) = f(g(h(a))$$ $$(f \circ (g \circ h))(a) = f((g \circ h)(a)) = f(g(h(a)).$$ Hence, composing permutations is associative because permutations are just functions. Identity. The identity permutation, $\text{id}$ , sends every element to itself. For any $\alpha \in S_n$ and any $x \in \{1, 2, 3, \ldots,n\}$ , we have: \begin{align*} (\alpha \circ \text{id})(x) = \alpha(\text{id}(x)) = \alpha(x) \\ (\text{id} \circ \alpha)(x) = \text{id}(\alpha(x)) = \alpha(x). \end{align*} Hence, the identity permutation is the identity element in the group. Inverses. Let $\sigma \in S_n$ . Then, $\sigma$ is a bijection from $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ to $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ . A function is bijective if and only if it is invertible. Hence, another bijection, $\sigma^{-1}$ , also exists.

For $f \in \mathcal{S}$ define $$ \hat f := Ff := (2\pi)^{-\frac{n}{2}} \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \exp(-ixy) f(y)dy$$ where $xy$ is the standard scalar product of $x$ and $y$ .

Let $A$ be a discrete $\Bbb{Z}_p$ module. Let $\gamma=1\in\Bbb{Z}_p$ . Let $\Gamma_n = p^n\Gamma$ . Then either by definition or proof, we have $$H^i(\Gamma,A) = \newcommand\fcolim{\varinjlim\limits}\fcolim_n H^i(\ZZ/p^n\ZZ,A^{\Gamma_n}),$$ but $\ZZ/p^n\ZZ$ is a finite, cyclic group, so on the right hand side, we should have isomorphisms $$H^i(\ZZ/p^n\ZZ,A^{\Gamma_n})\cong H^{i+2}(\ZZ/p^n\ZZ,A^{\Gamma_n}),$$ for $i>0$ . The only reason these would fail to induce an isomorphism on the left hand  side is if they weren't natural, i.e., they didn't commute with the inflation maps in the direct limit. Thus I must conclude that these isomorphisms shouldn't be natural, since $H^1(\Gamma,A) \cong A/(\gamma-1)A$ , and I'm told that $H^n(\Gamma,A) = 0$ for $n\ge 2$ (specifically, I'm told that $\ZZ_p$ is free pro- $p$ , and free pro- $p$ groups have $p$ -cohomological dimension 1). The inflation maps $H^i(\Gamma/\Gamma_m,A^{\Gamma_m})\to H^i(\Gamma/\Gamma_n,A^{\Gamma_n})$ for $m \le n$ are defined  as the induced maps of the map of pairs $(\Gamma/\Gamma_m,A^{\Gamma_m})\to (\Gamma/\Gamma_n,A^{\Gamma_n})$ . For the usual resolution of cyclic groups, this corresponds to the diagram $$ \require{AMScd} \begin{CD} \cdots   @>N_n >>  \ZZ[\ZZ/p^n]  @>\gamma -1 >>  \ZZ[\ZZ/p^n]  @>N_n >>  \ZZ[\ZZ/p^n]  @>\gamma -1 >>  \ZZ[\ZZ/p^n]  @>\epsilon >> \ZZ \\ @. @VVV @VVV @VVV @VVV @VVV\\ \cdots  @>N_m >>  \ZZ[\ZZ/p^m]  @>\gamma -1 >>  \ZZ[\ZZ/p^m]  @>N_m >>  \ZZ[\ZZ/p^m]  @>\gamma -1 >>  \ZZ[\ZZ/p^m]  @>\epsilon >> \ZZ, \end{CD} $$ where the maps $N_n$ are the norm maps, $N_n = \sum_{i=0}^{p^n-1} \gamma^i$ . Dropping the augmentation maps $\epsilon$ , and taking $\newcommand\Hom{\operatorname{Hom}}\Hom(-,A^{\Gamma_m})$ or $\Hom(-,A^{\Gamma_n})$ as appropriate, we get $$ \begin{CD} \cdots  @<N_m <<  A^{\Gamma_m} @<\gamma -1 <<  A^{\Gamma_m}  @<N_m <<  A^{\Gamma_m} @<\gamma -1 <<  A^{\Gamma_m} \\ @. @VVV @VVV @VVV @VVV\\ \cdots   @<N_n << A^{\Gamma_n} @<\gamma -1 << A^{\Gamma_n} @<N_n << A^{\Gamma_n}  @<\gamma -1 << A^{\Gamma_n} . \end{CD} $$ We should be careful about the vertical maps, which are all identical. The vertical map sends $\phi_a : \ZZ[\ZZ/p^m]\to A^{\Gamma_m}$ , where $\phi_a(\gamma)= a\in \Gamma^m$ , to the map $\tilde{\phi_a}=\iota \circ \phi_a \circ \ZZ[q]$ , where $\iota$ is the appropriate inclusion and $q$ the appropriate quotient. Then $\tilde{\phi_a}(\gamma) = \iota(\phi_a(\ZZ[q](\gamma))) = \iota(\phi_a(\gamma))=\iota(a)$ . Thus the vertical maps are all the inclusion map. I should point out here, that for an analogous calculation of group cohomology for $\widehat{\ZZ}$ in Local Fields Serre claims that these vertical maps should be multiplication by $p^{n-m}$ . But then every other homology group (other than the $0^{\text{th}}$ ) is equal, and all the vertical maps are equal, so we should have naturality of the isomorphisms with respect to the inflation maps (the vertical maps here). Something must be wrong somewhere. Questions: Where have I gone wrong above? I haven't found a source clearly giving the cohomology groups $H^n(\Gamma,A)$ . Are they indeed $H^0=A^\Gamma$ , $H^1 = A/(\gamma-1)A$ , $H^i = 0$ for $i>1$ ? What should the vertical maps be in my diagram? Did I correctly compute them, or have I made a mistake somewhere? Is there a simpler way to derive the cohomology of $\ZZ_p$ than as a direct limit of the cohomology of cyclic groups? If this approach to computing the cohomology doesn't work, could you suggest an approach that might be more helpful? Edit In an exercise after Chapter XIII, Section 1 of Local Fields Serre indicates that the vertical maps should in fact not be identical.

I was trying to prove that there are normal subgroups of order $5^{k},5^{k}\cdot2,5^{k}\cdot4$ . I saw the following statement: Let $P$ be a $p$ -Sylow subgroup of $G$ . Then obviously $|P|=5^k$ . Why the order of $P$ is $5^k$ ? I can't figure the connection between the $p$ -Sylow subgroup and $5^k$ . From the third Sylow theorem I know that $n_{2}|5^k$ and $n_2\equiv 2\,(mod\,2)$ but how does it help me? Edit: After understanding what I missed, I'll try to solve it: From the first Sylow theorem we know that $G$ has a $5$ -Sylow subgroup of order $5^k$ . I'll prove that $P\triangleleft G$ . On one hand $n_5=|G\,:\,N_G(P)|$ and on the other hand (third Sylow theorem) we get $n_5\equiv 1\,(mod\, 5)$ . From Lagrange we know that $P$ is subgroup of $N_G(P)$ so we know that $5^k$ divides $N_G(P)$ so there is $s\in\mathbb{N}$ so $|N_G(P)|=5^k\cdot s$ . We get $$|G\,:\,N_G(P)|=\frac{5^k\cdot 8}{5^k\cdot s}=\frac{8}{s}$$ We conclude that $n_5$ divides $8$ and the remainder is $1$ while dividing by $5$ meaning $n_5=1$ . So we have only one $5$ -Sylow subgroup meaning $P\triangleleft G$ . What do you think? Edit 2 : I was wondering if we need it all? From the Sylow $III$ theorem we get $n_5|8$ and $n_5\equiv 1 \, (mod \,5)$ . from $n_5|8$ we get $n_5\in \{1,2,4,8\}$ and from $n_5\equiv 1 \, (mod \,5)$ we get $n_5=1$ so there is only one $5$ -Sylow group meaning $P\triangleleft G$ . Is it correct? Edit 3 (Last edit I promise!) I will prove that $G$ has a normal subgroup of order $4\cdot 5^k$ . By Lagrange theorem we get: $$|G/P|=\frac{|G|}{|P|}=\frac{5^{k}\cdot 8}{5^{k}}=8$$ $8$ is a power of prime number so we $G/P$ has a subgroup of order $4$ and $2$ of the following format: $A/P$ . From Lagrange: $$|A|=|A/P|\cdot|P|=4\cdot5^{k}$$ And Also, $$|G\,:\,A|=\frac{|G|}{|A|}=\frac{8\cdot5^{k}}{4\cdot5^{k}}=2$$ So $A$ is a subgroup of $G$ of order $4\cdot 5^k$ and index $2$ , so its normal. Now I wonder how to prove that $G$ has a normal group of order $2\cdot 5^k$ . We stated that $G/P$ has a subgroup $B/P$ of order $2$ .

Lastly, because in Aut$(L)$ we have that $X\mapsto1$ and therefore $$\rho^3=(\sigma_1\sigma_2)^3=(1/X-1)^3=1/X^3-3/X^2+3/X-1=1-3+3-1=0$$ and the order of $\rho$ is 3. Am I thinking on the right path or is this not even close?

To this end, observe that a cube has four diagonals and the rotation group induces a group of permutations on the four diagonals. But we must be careful not to assume that different rotations correspond to different permutations. To see that this is so, all we need do is show that all $24$ permutations of the diagonals arise from rotations. Labeling the consecutive diagonals $1,2,3,$ and $4$, it is obvious that there is $90^\circ$ rotation that gives the permutation $\alpha = (1234)$; another $90^\circ$ rotation perpendicular to our first one gives the permutations $\beta=(1423)$. See Figure.So the group of permutations induced by the rotations contains the eight-element subgroup $\{\epsilon,\alpha,\alpha^2,\alpha^3,\beta^2,\beta^2\alpha,\beta^2\alpha^2,\beta^2\alpha^3\}$ and $\alpha\beta$, which has order $3$.

I considered all the subgroups of $Gal(\mathbb{Q}(\alpha,i\sqrt{2})$/$\mathbb{Q}$) but I didn't know which are the corresponding fixed subfields.
