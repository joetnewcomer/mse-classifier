I believe that no finite sum of irrational primes (hence element) of the set exists such that $x=-5^{0.5}+11^{0.5}$. So now I wonder, what could this set be called (I haven't formally studied mathematics. Can it be regarded as a group, for I am not sure if it can fairly said to satisfy the latin square property. I am tempted to say that is does, but then again, is there a very specific name for the group I seem to have described, with its particular characteristic of ""fundamental"" elements and ""constructed"" elements?

25,Cardinality of infinite sets - Help with intuition,Cardinality of infinite sets - Help with intuition,,"Yesterday I studied the cardinality of infinite sets and, I must say, it was the first time I have ever distrusted math. That is, it was the first time I have not bought - hook, line and sinker - something about math that was proven to me by a mathematics professor. This is not to say that I think it is untrue. I am saying that the truth of the cardinality of infinite sets is so at odds with my intuition that I am having trouble believing it.  And I could use a bit more explanation, I think, to clear up a few things. The distinction between the rules governing finite and infinite sets. For example, we can say that the odd numbers are a proper subset of the integers. We know this absolutely, correct? Yet, we can then prove using diagonalization that the set containing all odds and the set containing all integers have the same cardinality, which is Aleph-null. How is that we can allow such discontinuity in our understanding of these sets? How can both of those two statements be simultaneously true? How, if A is a proper subset of B, can |A|=|B|? I know this doesn't hold when we limit the conversation to finite sets. However, I don't understand why we can't make the same assertion about these two infinite sets - or at least not definitively say they both have cardinality Aleph-null. Proving that the reals don't form a bijective map to Aleph-null. This was proven by trying to map the reals onto the naturals. More specifically, the professor considered only the continuum and showed that the continuum can't map to the naturals and therefore neither can the reals. The professor did this by showing that any list of natural numbers could never contain all the reals because we can always create at least one new number not contained in the list. HOWEVER, it felt like a bit of flashy wording to me. If we can do this and then say ""look, we didn't account for this number"" and furthermore not be allowed to say ""okay, but I still have this natural number to which I can map that real number"" in this instance, why do the same arguments not apply to other instances? That is, why can't I do the exact same thing when dealing with the mapping between odds/integers? I know this isn't the typical question for stackexchange, but I really want to nail this down.

( @ Brian: I expect that the technical details you mention in your post refer to the different elements which can are equivalent in the preordered set but not in the poset. Is this correct?)

So is it correct to say that inclusion/exclusion are synonymous when it comes to set theory, as they're just different ways of building a set? This might sound trivial, but I have a reason for asking: I want to understand if inclusion and exclusion are ""commutative"" properties, i.e. it doesn't matter in which order you apply them. For example, let's say I make an operation to ""filter"" my set, by including all even numbers as we did before, producing set B $B = \{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\}$ And then a separate operation to ""exclude"" any numbers less than 6 from set B, resulting in set C: $C = \{6, 8, 10\}$ What if I started with A and applied the operations the other way around?

Is this true for all cases no matter the set, however? Is there a way to prove that applying ""filters"" to a set (I'm not sure of the proper term) will always be commutative? So in summary, there are two questions here: Are the notions of ""inclusion"" and ""exclusion"" really synonymous from the point of view of applying an operation to a set to produce a subset?

This might sound trivial, but I have a reason for asking: I want to understand if inclusion and exclusion are ""commutative"" properties, i.e. it doesn't matter in which order you apply them. For example, let's say I make an operation to ""filter"" my set, by including all even numbers as we did before, producing set B And then a separate operation to ""exclude"" any numbers less than 6 from set B, resulting in set C: What if I started with A and applied the operations the other way around? First remove all numbers less than 6: Then filter B to ""include"" only even numbers: It seems intuitively to me that the result will always be the same no matter which order you apply the operation. Is this true for all cases no matter the set, however? Is there a way to prove that applying ""filters"" to a set (I'm not sure of the proper term) will always be commutative? So in summary, there are two questions here: Are the notions of ""inclusion"" and ""exclusion"" really synonymous from the point of view of applying an operation to a set to produce a subset? Will applying these operations to produce a subset of a set always be commutative, i.e. produce the same result?","A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\} \{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\} \{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\} B = \{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\} C = \{6, 8, 10\} B = \{6, 7, 8, 9, 10\} C = \{6, 8, 10\}",['elementary-set-theory']

The sum of the elements of each pair equals the index of the corresponding layer plus $1$ . It provides the key idea, but I feel I need to explicitly show that it really works. Please check if the followings are valid. First, let us restrict the domain of discourse to natural numbers. I defined a function $f: \N \to \N^2$ with $$ \forall m :\forall n \le m:f\left(\frac{(m-1)m}{2} + n\right) = (n,m-n+1) $$ where $m$ is the index for each layer of the list and $n$ is the column index. $(m-1)m/2$ can be thought of as the accumulated number of elements from the first layer and the layer $m-1$ . Now, we have to show $f$ is bijective. (surjective) I am going to show that $\forall a, b: \exists k:f(k) = (a,b)$ . Let $n = a$ , and $m-n+1 = b$ . Then, $$ m = n + b - 1 \ge n $$ Letting $ k = (a + b - 2)(a + b - 1)/2 + a$ shows $f$ is subjective. (uniqueness of $m$ and $n$ for each argument $k$ of $f$ ) First, we show that $$ \forall k: \exists!m,n: \left(n \le m \land k = \frac{(m-1)m}{2} + n\right) $$ It is easy to show that $$ \left\{\left.\left(\frac{(m-1)m}{2}\right.,\left.\frac{m(m+1)}{2}\right]\cap\N ~\right|~m\in\N \right\} $$ partitions $\N$ . Therefore, for arbitrary $k$ , there is unique $m$ such that $$ \frac{(m-1)m}{2} < k \le \frac{m(m+1)}{2} \text{ or equivalently, } 0 < k - \frac{(m-1)m}{2} \le m $$ Using the result, let $n = k - {(m-1)m}/{2} $ .

Instead, they are often simply expressed in terms of $\cup, \cap, \setminus$ , etc. My question is whether there is any known precedent of a symbol for the operation $A \cup B^\complement$ . This would complete the following (where ? is a placeholder for the operation in question): $A \setminus B = A \cap B^\complement$ $A \operatorname{?} B = A \cup B^\complement$ For more context (based on discussion in the comments below): In everyday work, of course it makes sense to use just a few symbols (e.g. complement, $\cup, \cap, \setminus$ ) and express other operations in terms of these. This approach represents a practical tradeoff between two extremes: At one extreme, only one symbol is needed (just NAND or NOR, cf. functional completeness ). The drawback is that most expressions will be quite large when written this way. At the other extreme, we would have a unique symbol for each of the 16 operations. Expressions may be written more compactly with these symbols, but then there is more to memorize. (Why are the complement, $\cup, \cap, \setminus$ operations in particular given special status? My only guess is that they correspond with concepts in spoken language: NOT, OR, AND, WITHOUT, which, in turn, may correspond to which operations are most naturally computed by our brains, but I digress...) A comment below suggests simply using $(B \setminus A)^\complement$ to represent $A \cup B^\complement$ , but the same could be said of any operation, e.g. why do we need a symbol for set difference $A \setminus B$ when we can just write $A \cap B^\complement$ ? Or why do we need a special logical connective for implication (which actually corresponds to the set operation in question here)? My point is that sometimes things can be written more concisely with dedicated symbols for the uncommon cases. It may be rare that these symbols are needed, but in those instances where one of the uncommon set operations is heavily utilized ( $A \cup B^\complement$ in my case here), it would be nice to have some agreed-upon symbol. And here I simply want to know if there is any precedent in the literature for those weird cases.

The drawback is that most expressions will be quite large when written this way. At the other extreme, we would have a unique symbol for each of the 16 operations. Expressions may be written more compactly with these symbols, but then there is more to memorize. (Why are the complement, operations in particular given special status? My only guess is that they correspond with concepts in spoken language: NOT, OR, AND, WITHOUT, which, in turn, may correspond to which operations are most naturally computed by our brains, but I digress...) A comment below suggests simply using to represent , but the same could be said of any operation, e.g. why do we need a symbol for set difference when we can just write ? Or why do we need a special logical connective for implication (which actually corresponds to the set operation in question here)? My point is that sometimes things can be written more concisely with dedicated symbols for the uncommon cases. It may be rare that these symbols are needed, but in those instances where one of the uncommon set operations is heavily utilized ( in my case here), it would be nice to have some agreed-upon symbol. And here I simply want to know if there is any precedent in the literature for those weird cases. The diagram below (originally found on Wikipedia here or here ) shows that all 16 logical connectives have dedicated symbols. Why not extend this luxury to the corresponding set operations?","\cup, \cap, \setminus A \cup B^\complement A \setminus B = A \cap B^\complement A \operatorname{?} B = A \cup B^\complement \cup, \cap, \setminus \cup, \cap, \setminus (B \setminus A)^\complement A \cup B^\complement A \setminus B A \cap B^\complement A \cup B^\complement","['elementary-set-theory', 'notation']"
