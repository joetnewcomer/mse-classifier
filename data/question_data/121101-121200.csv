If we have a line given by $L_{a,b} = \{(x_1, x_2) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : c_1x_1 + c_2x_2 = d \}$ , how would we prove this statement? Writing it as a system of equations and showing the solution is unique? There is surely a better way, isn't it? I tried something like this, but I am not very confident this will work: If $l$ contains $a$ and $b$ , then (after some rearranging) we have $c_1(a_1-b_1) + c_2(a_2-b_2) = 0$ , now suppose there is another line containing these points. Let's call it $l'$ . This should look like this: $c'_1(a_1-b_1) + c'_2(a_2-b_2) = 0$ So we see, apart from being scalable with a factor $\lambda \in \mathbb{R} $ , these are the same line.

1,A geometric problem with families of congruent curves.,A geometric problem with families of congruent curves.,,"Consider the following mapping: In a square grid on a unit disk we shift the angles between intersecting segments, every shift in general different at different $(x,y)$ points. Take the continuum limit. The image of the gridlines (i.e. the blue lines below) will be curves with the same lengths, but will be contained in a different domain $D$ (shaded blue below right). Moreover, each family (i.e. verticals and horizontals in the disk), is composed of congruent curves (meaning that they differ just by a translation and, or, a rotation; equivalently, that they have the same curvature). The question is Show that Perimeter $\left(D\right)<2\pi$ . Analytically, it can be re-formulated as follows. Let's call $0<\gamma(x,y)<\pi$ the shift angle at every point. Since the image curves are congruent within each family, we have that $\gamma(x,y)=\psi(x)-\phi(y)$ , being $\psi$ and $\phi$ arbitrary, not even functions (satisfying the condition on $\gamma$ for every $(x,y)\in\:$ Disk). Then \begin{align} \text{Perimeter}\left(D\right)=\int_0^{2\pi}\mathbb{d}t\sqrt{1-2\sin t \cos t \cos\gamma(t)}, \end{align} with $\gamma(t)=\gamma(x=\cos t,y=\sin t)=\psi(\cos t)-\phi(\sin t)$ . The integrand in general varies between $0$ and $\sqrt{2}$ , so it is not immediate to establish that $\text{Perimeter}\left(D\right)<2\pi$ . Expanding the square root one can show that the quadratic terms satisfy some inequalities, but the linear term has no definite sign for any pair $\psi,\:\phi$ . So I don't think that handling this integral expression may lead to an answer, but rather some geometrical proof/analysis using the fact the curves are congruent.","Consider the following mapping: In a square grid on a unit disk we shift the angles between intersecting segments, every shift in general different at different points.

If $c_1, c_2$ are positive then the angle bisector of the acute angle between the lines $a_1x+b_1y+c_1=0$ and $a_2x+b_2y+c_2=0$ is $\frac{a_1x+b_1y+c_1}{\sqrt{a_1^2+b_1^2}}=\frac{a_2x+b_2y+c_2}{\sqrt{a_2^2+b_2^2}}$ , if $a_1a_2+b_1b_2\lt0$ $\frac{a_1x+b_1y+c_1}{\sqrt{a_1^2+b_1^2}}=-\frac{a_2x+b_2y+c_2}{\sqrt{a_2^2+b_2^2}}$ , if $a_1a_2+b_1b_2\gt0$ I wonder what the proof for this is.

Describe the trace of such $P$ . We can solve this problem by using the following lemma: Let's imagine the tetrahedron with four vertices $O(0,0,0)$ , $A(a,b,c)$ , $B(b,c,a)$ and $C(c,a,b)$ . Since $\overline{\mathrm{OA}}=\overline{\mathrm{OB}}=\overline{\mathrm{OC}}=\overline{\mathrm{AB}}=\overline{\mathrm{BC}}=\overline{\mathrm{CA}}$ , we have $a^2+b^2+c^2=(a-b)^2+(b-c)^2+(c-a)^2\Rightarrow a^2+b^2+c^2=2(ab+bc+ca)$ . And since $\vec{\mathrm{OA}}=(a,b,c)$ , $\vec{\mathrm{OP}}=(x,y,z)$ , we have $\cos^2 \alpha=\left(\frac{\vec{\mathrm{OA}} \cdot \vec{\mathrm{OP}}}{\vert \vec{\mathrm{OA}} \vert \vert\vec{\mathrm{OP}}\vert}\right)^2=\frac{(ax+by+cz)^2}{(a^2+b^2+c^2)(x^2+y^2+z^2)}$ .

Then by the given equation, $\frac{(ax+by+cz)^2+(bx+cy+az)^2+(cx+ay+bz)^2}{(a^2+b^2+c^2)(x^2+y^2+z^2)}=1+\frac{2(ab+bc+ca)(xy+yz+zx)}{(a^2+b^2+c^2)(x^2+y^2+z^2)}=\frac{11}{6}$ .

21,Proving the existence of the Euler line using methods from Coordinate Geometry.,Proving the existence of the Euler line using methods from Coordinate Geometry.,,"I saw a video by Salman Khan, in which he gave a proof of existence of the Euler Line . He proved that the circumcenter , orthocenter and centroid of a triangle are collinear , and used normal geometry to do this. My background is in coordinate geometry, and I want to prove that the Euler line exists, using only methods from coordinate geometry, such as the distance between points formula, the section formulae (internal division), the perpendicular bisector formula , centroid formula and so on. For this, I need to know the coordinates of the circumcenter and the orthocenter , since the coordinates for the centroid are very easy to find and are given by the centroid formula . So, if I consider a triangle $ABC$ with $A \equiv (x_1, y_1)$ , $B \equiv (x_2, y_2)$ and $C \equiv (x_3, y_3)$ coordinates then by using the centroid formula I can find out that the x-coordinate (abscissa) and the y-coordinate (ordinate) of the centroid are following repectively: $$\left(\frac{x_1+x_2+x_3}{3}, \frac{y_1+y_2+y_3}{3}\right) $$ Let's denote the centroid of the triangle $D$ . Now, using perpendicular bisector formula, with some easy steps I got that the coordinates of the circumcenter of the triangle are the followings: $$\left(\frac{-\frac{1}{2}(x_2^{2}+y_2^{2}-x_3^{2}-y_3^{2})(y_1-y_2)+\frac{1}{2}(x_1^{2}+y_1^{2}-x_2^{2}-y_2^{2})(y_2-y_3)}{(x_1-x_2)(y_2-y_3)-(x_2-x_3)(y_1-y_2)}, \frac{-\frac{1}{2}(x_1^{2}+y_1^{2}-x_2^{2}-y_2^{2})(x_2-x_3)+\frac{1}{2}(x_2^{2}+y_2^{2}-x_3^{2}-y_3^{2})(x_1-x_2)}{(x_1-x_2)(y_2-y_3)-(x_2-x_3)(y_1-y_2)}\right) $$ Let's denote the circumcenter of the triangle $E$ . Then finding the equations of the altitudes of triangle $ABC$ , I found out again with some easy steps, that the coordinates of the orthocenter of the triangle are the followings: $$\left(\frac{(y_2-y_1)\{y_1(y_3-y_2)+x_1(x_3-x_2)\}-(y_3-y_2)\{y_3(y_2-y_1)+x_3(x_2-x_1)\}}{(x_2-x_3)(y_1-y_2)-(x_1-x_2)(y_2-y_3)}, \frac{(x_3-x_2)\{y_3(y_2-y_1)+x_3(x_2-x_1)\}-(x_2-x_1)\{y_1(y_3-y_2)+x_1(x_3-x_2)\}}{(x_2-x_3)(y_1-y_2)-(x_1-x_2)(y_2-y_3)}\right)$$ Let's denote the orthocenter of the triangle $F$ . As you can see, The circumcenter and orthocenter has very difficult coordinates in formation which I tried but can not be simplified any further. As you've already seen, to find from coordinate geometry, I need to solve simultaneous equations to find the intersection of two lines whose equations I got from using the vertices of the triangles, and this leads to a this very complicated Cartesian form of coordinates. As part of my textbook, I need to prove that the orthocenter, centroid and circumcenter is collinear and if I denote those points respectively as $F, D, E$ then prove that the ratio of the line segment $FD$ to $DE$ is $2$ to $1$ . That is $$\frac{FD}{DE}=\frac{2}{1}$$ This is basically the gist of the Euler's Line Theorem . I know that the circumcenter of a triangle is the orthocenter of the medial triangle, but this is not helpful for me, maybe you can see why.

I can compute the curvature like this: $$K_{\beta} = \frac{1}{||\dot{\beta}(t)||^3}\cdot\det({\dot{\beta}(t), \ddot{\beta}(t)})$$ Computations: $$\dot{\beta}(t) = (\cos t + 2\cos 2t, -\sin t -2\sin 2t)$$ $$\ddot{\beta}(t) = (-\sin t - 4 \sin 2t, -\cos t - 4 \cos 2t)$$ $$||\dot{\beta}(t))|| = (4\cos t + 5)^{1/2}$$ $$\det({\dot{\beta}(t),\ddot{\beta}(t)}) = -6 \cos t - 9$$ This is giving me the curvature $$K_{\beta}(t) = \frac{-6 \cos t -9}{(4 \cos t + 5)^{3/2}}$$ At this point I integrated the curvature with the help of Wolframalpha, which did it numerically but I'm pretty sure it's $-2\pi-1$ , when from the picture it should be $-4\pi$ .

I have seen the following result get used in a few contexts before, and although I can see intuitively why it must be true, I have been unable to find a rigorous argument justifying the same: Fact(?) Let $H$ be a hyperplane and $P$ any point in $\mathbb P^n \setminus H$ . Then there exists a linear transformation $A \in \text{GL}_{n+1}(k)$ such that $A(H)$ is the hyperplane $\{(x_0, \cdots , x_n) : x_0=0\}$ and $A(P) = (1, 0, \cdots , 0)$ . I am looking for a complete and concise proof of this result, which is clean if possible. I believe that one possible argument could rest on the following observations: $H$ is uniquely determined by any $n$ points on it. So we now pick $n+1$ points $P_1, \cdots , P_n$ on $H$ . There exists a linear transformation sending $P$ to $(1, 0, \cdots,  0)$ and $P_j$ to $(0, \cdots , 0 , 1, 0, \cdots, 0) \in \mathbb P^n$ ( $0$ in the $j$ -th slot, here the $n+1$ slots are being called the $0$ -th, $1$ -st, ..., $n$ -th slot slots) for each $1 \leq j \leq n$ . I have however been unable to make these clean and rigorous (I keep getting involved with too many linear equations) and am starting to doubt the accuracy of my intuition. I would really appreciate a complete argument for the above ""Fact(?)"" or a reference containing the same and if possible, suggestions on how to make my idea work. Edit (Some Progress): Thanks to Roland's comment, I think I have made some progress: Let $H$ be given by the equation $\sum_{j=0}^n a_j x_j = 0$ . Then in $\mathbb A^{n+1}$ , $H$ remains the same (nevertheless I will call it $H_0$ when viewed as a subset of $\mathbb A^{n+1}$ ) while $P := (p_0, \cdots , p_n)$ becomes the line $L_0 := \{(p_0 t, \cdots , p_n t) : t \in k\}$ . I should first show that there is a matrix $A \in \text{GL}_{n+1}(k)$ such that $A(H_0) = H_1$ and $A(L_0)=L_1$ , where $H_1 := \{(0, x_1, \cdots , x_n) : x_j \in k\} \subset \mathbb A^{n+1}$ and $L_1$ is the line $\{(t, 0, \cdots , 0) : t \in k\} \subset A^{n+1}$ . So now I can pick $n$ linearly independent points $A_j \in H_0$ ( $1 \leq j \leq n$ ), which is possible since $H_0$ is an $n$ -dimensional subspace of $\mathbb A^{n+1}$ and I get a linear transformation $A \in \text{GL}_{n+1}(k)$ which sends $A_j$ to $(0, \cdots , 0 , 1, 0, \cdots 0)$ (with $1$ in the $j$ -th slot) for each $1 \leq j \leq n$ . Thus $A$ sends $H_0$ to $H_1$ . I still have to send $A(L_0)$ to $L_1$ so I need a linear transformation $T \in \text{GL}_{n+1}(k)$ which sends $A(L_0)$ (which is also a line through the origin) to $L_1$ and leaves $H_1$ invariant (as a set). Finally, we let $T \in \text{GL}_{n+1}(k)$ be the linear transformation that sends $(p_0, \cdots , p_n) \in \mathbb A^{n+1}$ to $(1, 0, \cdots , 0)$ and fixes some basis of $H_1$ pointwise. Upon getting this last linear transformation $T$ , we note that $TA \in \text{GL}_{n+1}(k)$ sends $H_0$ to $H_1$ and $L_0$ to $L_1$ in $\mathbb A^{n+1}$ . Therefore $TA$ should also do the required job, namely, send $H$ to $\{(0, x_1, \cdots , x_n)\} \subset \mathbb P^n$ and $P$ to $(1, 0, \cdots 0)$ , thus completing the proof and making ""Fact(?)""$ a fact.

I have however been unable to make these clean and rigorous (I keep getting involved with too many linear equations) and am starting to doubt the accuracy of my intuition. I would really appreciate a complete argument for the above ""Fact(?)"" or a reference containing the same and if possible, suggestions on how to make my idea work. Edit (Some Progress): Thanks to Roland's comment, I think I have made some progress: Let be given by the equation . Then in , remains the same (nevertheless I will call it when viewed as a subset of ) while becomes the line . I should first show that there is a matrix such that and , where and is the line . So now I can pick linearly independent points ( ), which is possible since is an -dimensional subspace of and I get a linear transformation which sends to (with in the -th slot) for each . Thus sends to . I still have to send to so I need a linear transformation which sends (which is also a line through the origin) to and leaves invariant (as a set). Finally, we let be the linear transformation that sends to and fixes some basis of pointwise. Upon getting this last linear transformation , we note that sends to and to in . Therefore should also do the required job, namely, send to and to , thus completing the proof and making ""Fact(?)""$ a fact.

In triangle $ABC$ with $AB\neq AC$ , let its incircle be tangent to sides $BC$ , $CA$ , and $AB$ at $D$ , $E$ , and $F$ , respectively. The internal angle bisector of $\angle BAC$ intersects lines $DE$ and $DF$ at $X$ and $Y$ , respectively. Let $S$ and $T$ be distinct points on side $BC$ such that $\angle XSY=\angle XTY=90^\circ$ . Finally, let $\gamma$ be the circumcircle of $\triangle AST$ . (a) Help Elmo show that $\gamma$ is tangent to the circumcircle of $\triangle ABC$ . (b) Help Elmo show that $\gamma$ is tangent to the incircle of $\triangle ABC$ . Very Hard problem .. My Progress : WLOG $AB<AC$ . Define $N=BC\cap AY $ . Claim: $\angle ASX=\angle XST$ Proof: Since $\angle XSY=90$ , by lemma 9.18 from EGMO it's enough to show that $(A,N;X,Y)=-1$ . Now, note that $AEFD$ is a harmonic quad . So $(A,D;E,F)=-1$ . So projecting through $D$ on $AI$ , we get $(A,DD\cap AI=N;DE\cap AI=X,DF\cap AI=Y )=-1$ . So $\angle ASX=\angle XST$ . Similarly , we can get $\angle ATX=\angle XTN$ So we get $X$ and $Y$ as the incentre and $A$ -excentre of $\Delta AST$ respectively . Also we get $AS$ and $AT$ isogonals [ since $X$ is the incentre and $X\in AI$ ] Now, let $S'=AS\cap (ABC)$ , $T'=AT\cap (ABC)$ . By angle chase , we get $ST||S'T'$ and hence $AST~AS'T'$ and by homothety , we get $(AST)$ and $(ABC)$ tangent. This proves part $A$ . For Part $B$ : I applied inversion $\psi$ centered at $A$ with radius $\sqrt{AX\cdot AY}$ radius followed by reflection about the angle bisector of $\angle AST$ . Note that $\psi:X\leftrightarrow Y$ , $\psi:S\leftrightarrow T$ and $\psi:BC\leftrightarrow (AST)$ . Let us assume that $\angle AXB=\angle AYC=90$ [ I haven't got the proof of this , but it looks very true] Now, let $I-A$ be the $A$ -excentre of $\Delta ABC$ , $F^*$ be touch point of $A$ -excircle to line $AC$ , $E^*$ be touch point of $A$ -excircle to line $AB$ , And $K^*$ be touch point of $A$ -excircle to $BC$ . Note that $K^*,C,F^*,I-A$ is cyclic . But it's known that $\angle K^*CF^*=180-C\implies \angle CK^*F^*=\angle CF^*K^*=C/2$ . So $\angle XYF*=90+C/2$ . Also note that $\Delta DXC$ is isosceles , hence $\angle XEC=90-C/2$ . Hence $XEF^*Y$ is cyclic. Similarly we can get $XFE^*Y$ is cyclic [ $BK*I-AE*$ is cyclic] Hence $AX\cdot AY=AE\cdot AF^*=AF\cdot AE^*$ . So $\psi:E\leftrightarrow E^*$ and $\psi:F\leftrightarrow F^*$ . Define $D^*$ as the inverse image of $D$ by $\psi$ . Note that $(D^*E^*F^*)$ will be a circle tangent to $AB$ at $E^*$ , tangent to $AC$ at $F^*$ and $(AST)$ at $D^*$ . If I am able to show that $(D^*E^*F^*)$ is the $A$ -excircle , then I am done .

For a unit sphere, we can use the area of a spherical cap to get us a upper bound of the angle: $$ A = \frac{4\pi}{N} = 2\pi \left(1-\cos(\theta)\right) \\ \theta = \cos^{-1}\left(1 - \frac{2}{N}\right) $$ Where $\theta$ here should be half of the angle between two neighboring points.  This is an upper bound because it assumes we are completely covering the surface with circles around each point, which we can't do.  The actual circles around each point would have to be smaller, so our angle would be smaller. But what about for a higher dimensional hypersphere?

I looked up the sphere packing densities (in Euclidean space, which is probably fine for large enough $N$) at Mathworld .  The first 8 dimensions are the only ones that are listed (and I believe known), and they fall off fairly quickly with dimension (it looks close to linear for the first 8, but it is likely exponential or similar), in 8 dimensions the packing density is roughly .25.

78,Determining the geometry of an arc segment from two known points and a curvature,Determining the geometry of an arc segment from two known points and a curvature,,"Short version: How do i determine the profile of arc segment from two known points and curvature of the arc? Long version: As an intro into modelling co-rotating twin-screw extruders i am trying to learn how the profiles of the screws are determined. For those of you who don't know, twin-screw extruders are machines which have two screws intermeshed in such a way that the action of a flight of one screw wipes the root of the other screw alternately. The below image shows the intermeshing of the screw (left) and the self-wiping action in a frontview perspective (right): For this self-wiping action, the screw needs a special geometry determined by a special set of rules. In the analysis i am following The geometry of self-cleaning twin-screw extruders by C. Rauwendaal. The basic geometric properties of the barrel: where $\alpha_i$ is the intermesh angle, $I_h$ is the intermesh height, $C_l$ is the centerline distance and finally $D$ and $D_r$ are the screw and root diameter respectively. For a given screw diameter $D$, these are related through some geometric considerations: $$\frac{C_l}{D}=\cos\left(\frac{\alpha_i}{2}\right) \qquad \frac{I_h}{D} = \frac{1}{2}\sin\left(\frac{1}{2}\alpha_i\right) \qquad \frac{D_r}{D} = 2\frac{C_l}{D}-1$$ which basically implies that chosing an intermesh angle $\alpha_i$ fixes the centerline distance $C_l$, the intermesh height $I_h$ and the root diameter $D_r$. Due to symmetry only a quarter of a screw needs to be examined. Such a quarter is further divisible into three sections: the tip -> $0<\alpha\leq\alpha_t/2$, the flank -> $\alpha_t/2<\alpha\leq\alpha_t/2+\alpha_f$ the root -> $\alpha_t/2+\alpha_f<\alpha\leq\alpha_t/2+\alpha_f+\alpha_r/2$ where $\alpha$ is the angle from the horizontal, $\alpha_t$ is the tip angle, $\alpha_f$ is the flank angle, $\alpha_r$ is the root angle. As the two screws have the same cross-sectional shape, the root angle should equal the tip angle. Furthermore, the sum of the tip angle, root angle and flank angle should be: $$\frac{\alpha_r}{2}+\alpha_f+\frac{\alpha_t}{2}=\frac{\pi}{2}$$ Given the assumption $\alpha_r=\alpha_t$ as discussed above, this yields for the tip angle: $$\alpha_t=\frac{\pi}{2}-\alpha_f$$ For the case of co-rotating screws, it is given that the flank angle has to be equal to the intermesh angle, i.e. $\alpha_f = \alpha_i$. From this follows then the tip angle $\alpha_t$ and the root angle $\alpha_r$. Having determined all these geometric properties, I would now like to be able to reconstruct the profile of the screw. Taking the center of the screw as the origin $O$, the root and tip of the screw are easily described as they have constant radii with respect to $O$. However, the flank area with respect to $O$ has a variable radius which ranges from $\frac{D_r}{2}$ at the root angle to $\frac{D}{2}$ at the tip angle. In other words: $$r = \begin{cases} \frac{D}{2} & 0\leq\alpha<\frac{1}{2}\alpha_{t}\\ R\left(\alpha\right) & \frac{1}{2}\alpha_{t}\leq\alpha<\frac{1}{2}\alpha_{t}+\alpha_{f}\\ \frac{D_{r}}{2} & \frac{1}{2}\alpha_{t}+\alpha_{f}\leq\alpha<\frac{1}{2}\alpha_{t}+\alpha_{f}+\frac{1}{2}\alpha_{r} \end{cases}$$ However, in the article it is given that the shape of the flank is determined by an arc of a circle (with a different unknown origin $C$) with radius $C_l$. What i would like to know is how I can determine the profile described by $R\left(\alpha\right)$ which is basically an arc segment between two points (i.e. $[r,\alpha]=[D/2, \alpha_t/2]$ and $[r,\alpha]=[D_r/2, \alpha_t/2+\alpha_f]$) with known curvature (radius $C_l$)? Update: The answer of @ja27 gives a good and easy geometric method of constructing the arc in question: However, as stated in the question (although maybe not clearly enough), I would like to be to describe the arc segment in terms of origin $O$ and angle $\alpha$ through function $R(\alpha)$, rather than origin $C$ and angle $\theta$.","Short version: How do i determine the profile of arc segment from two known points and curvature of the arc?

79,Isometries of $\mathbb C^2$,Isometries of,\mathbb C^2,"I have studied isometries of the Euclidean plane $\mathbb R^2$ but am trying to understand what happens when we study $\mathbb C^2$ (over $\mathbb C$) instead. In particular, I would like to see if a certain way of decomposing (uniquely) an isometry of the plane has some nice analogue in $\mathbb C^2$.  To this end, I decided to generalize the notions of translation, rotation (about $\vec 0$), and reflection about the $x$-axis to get the following conjecture. Given an isometry $\mathcal I$ of $\mathbb C^2$ (under the metric induced by the norm $\|(z,w)\|^2=z\bar{z}+w\bar{w}$), we have that   $\mathcal I= T_{\vec v}\circ O\circ R$ for some translation $T$ by $\vec v$, some   orthogonal transformation $O$, and some map $R$ which denotes either   the reflection $F:(z,w)\mapsto (z, \bar{w})$ or the identity $I$. My initial thought-process is as follows. Set $\vec x =\mathcal I(\vec 0)$. Then the translation in the desired decomposition would be $T_{\vec x}$. Moreover, notice that the map $A:=T_{-\vec x}\circ \mathcal I$ is linear. If $\det A>0$, then set $O=A$. Otherwise, we need $O$ to be something else. An intuitive choice is to set $O=AF$ in this case. But $F$ is not linear considered as map on $\mathbb C^2$ over $\mathbb C$. However, $F$ is linear as a map on the four-dimensional space $\mathbb R^4$--that is, as the map $(a,b,c,d)\mapsto (a,b,-c,-d)$. And this should be fine, as I think that we can adjust the other maps easily to maps on $\mathbb R^4$. Now, here are my questions. (1) Since I want $O$ to be orthogonal, is there a relatively easy way to show that $A$ or $AF$ (depending on the case) is orthogonal? I am unsure how to write down the matrix representations of these maps. (2) And of course, I haven't shown the details of the actual proof of my conjecture. I just have been able to outline what I think should be the case. But I see no way of getting from the fact that $\mathcal I$ is distance-preserving to the fact that it can be decomposed in the way described. I have vaguely tried to play around with the eigenvalues for $O$, which I know should be complex conjugate pairs with norm $1$. But is it problematic if none of these is real, considering that we're technically using $\mathbb R^4$ and no longer $\mathbb C^2$? And to be honest, I am not sure anyway how studying the eigenvalues would help me with the proof ultimately.

99,Counter-clockwise angle between edges,Counter-clockwise angle between edges,,"I have a couple of connected lines (or rather edges) in the form of coordinates, that is for each edge a starting point $(x_s,y_s)$ and end point $(x_e,y_e)$. and I want to know a specific angle between them. Here is a drawing to illustrate which angles I want: The blue arrows are (in this case 4) edges. The orange-like pieces of a circle are supposed to show the desired angles. That is, I want the counter-clockwise angle of the respective second edge to the respective first edge. How do I do that?","I have a couple of connected lines (or rather edges) in the form of coordinates, that is for each edge a starting point $(x_s,y_s)$ and end point $(x_e,y_e)$. and I want to know a specific angle between them.
