0,What is the distributive reflection of the lattice of ideals of a ring?,What is the distributive reflection of the lattice of ideals of a ring?,,"Let $A$ be a commutative ring and let $L$ be the set of ideals of $A$ , partially ordered by inclusion. $L$ is a complete lattice but is not distributive in general. For instance, in the polynomial ring $k [x, y]$ : $$((x) + (y)) \cap (x + y) = (x + y)$$ $$((x) \cap (x + y)) + ((y) \cap (x + y)) = (x (x + y), y (x + y))$$ On the other hand, sometimes $L$ is distributive – for instance, if $A$ is a principal ideal domain. By general nonsense, there is a frame (= complete lattice in which binary meets distribute over arbitrary joins) $F$ and a ""frame"" homomorphism (= monotone map preserving finite meets and arbitrary joins) $L \to F$ such that every ""frame"" homomorphism from $L$ to a frame factors through $L \to F$ in a unique way. This is called the frame reflection of $L$ . Question. Is there a ""nice"" description of the frame reflection of $L$ ? Again, by general nonsense, the ""frame"" homomorphism $L \to F$ is surjective and admits a right adjoint $F \to L$ , which means we can think of $F$ as a certain subset of $L$ that is closed under arbitrary meets. In other words, $F$ is isomorphic to the poset of ideals of $A$ satisfying a certain condition – is there a ""nice"" description of that condition? There is a well known frame of ideals associated with $A$ , namely the frame of radical ideals of $A$ , better known in its incarnation as the poset of open subsets of $\operatorname{Spec} A$ . In general, $F$ is ""larger"" than the frame of radical ideals: for instance, if $A = \mathbb{Z}$ . So $F$ corresponds to some kind of generalisation of radical ideal. It may be worth pointing out that $A \mapsto F$ is probably not functorial. The obvious functor $A \mapsto L$ sends ring homomorphisms to monotone maps that preserve arbitrary joins, but binary meets may not be preserved. (This is basically because multiplication in the ring maps to ideal multiplication rather than ideal intersection. So we get a quantale homomorphism rather than a ""frame"" homomorphism – and taking the frame reflection of $L$ as a quantale yields the frame of radical ideals.)","Let be a commutative ring and let be the set of ideals of , partially ordered by inclusion. is a complete lattice but is not distributive in general.

2,Why does the blowup of a curve at a singular point decreases the arithmetic genus?,Why does the blowup of a curve at a singular point decreases the arithmetic genus?,,"In Beauville's Complex Algebraic Surfaces , problem II.20 we are asked to show that an irreducible curve $C$ in a smooth surface $S$ becomes smooth after a finite number of blowups. He says that a way to do this is to show that the arithmetic genus decreases everytime we blowup $C$ at a singular point. There is a proof of this in Barth, Hulek, Peters, Van de Ven's Compact Complex Surfaces using the following idea (I'll paraphrase): Consider the case when $C$ has only one singular point $P$ . Let $x,y$ be local coordinates for $S$ in a neighbourhood $U$ of $P$ , so that the blowup is described as the subvariety of $U\times\Bbb{P}^1$ given by $sy=tx$ . We will assume that $y=0$ is the only tangent direction of $C$ at $P$ and that the multiplicity of $\widetilde{C}$ at the corresponding point is the same (in the other cases, the multiplicity clearly decreases). Then $C$ is described locally by the power series $$f=ay^m+\sum_{i+i> m}a_{ij}x^iy^j.$$ Restricting to the open set $V_s=\{s\neq 0\}$ and writing $t$ instead of $\frac{t}{s}$ for simplicity, we get that the strict transform $\widetilde{C}$ is given by $$\widetilde{f}=at^m+\sum_{i+j>m}a_{ij}x^{i+j-m}t^j$$ Then we observe that the order with which $\widetilde{f}(x,0)$ vanishes at the origin is strictly less than the order with which $f(x,0)$ does, which shows that the process will eventually terminate.

What I'm mostly interested in is the case where $X = G/P$ is a homogeneous space of an algebraic group $G$ , where $P$ is a closed subgroup.  The case where $G$ is reductive and $P$ is a parabolic subgroup (so $X$ is projective) is my primary concern, but it'll be nice if a description for all algebraic groups can be found. Motivation: $H^1(X,\Omega_{X,cl}^1)$ parametrizes all twisted sheaves of differential operators on $X$ . Some thoughts in the case where $G$ is reductive and $P = B$ is a Borel subgroup that may or may not help: We know $H^i(X,\Omega_X^1) = 0$ if $i \neq 1$ and is $\mathbb{C}^{\mathrm{rank} G}$ if $i =1$ . So the long exact sequence induced by $0 \to \Omega_{X,cl}^1 \to \Omega_X^1 \to \Omega_X^1/\Omega_{X,cl}^1 \to 0$ reduces to $$0 \to H^0(X,\Omega_X^1/\Omega_{X,cl}^1) \to H^1(X,\Omega_{X,cl}^1) \to H^1(X,\Omega_X^1) \to H^1(X,\Omega_X^1/\Omega_{X,cl}^1) \to H^2(X,\Omega_{X,cl}^1) \to 0,$$ but we need more knowledge of cohomologies of $\Omega_X^1/\Omega_{X,cl}^1$ to proceed. Homogeneous twisted sheaves of differential operators (htdo) are parametrized by $\mathfrak{b}/[\mathfrak{b},\mathfrak{b}]$ which has dimension $\mathrm{rank}G$ . Therefore $H^1(X,\Omega_{X,cl}^1) \to H^1(X,\Omega_X^1)$ cannot be a proper injection.

I have read that $\ch(i_* \oh_L) = L + \frac{1}{2}P$ where $L$ and $P$ are the classes of a line and a point in the cohomology ring $H^*(X, \mathbb{Q})$ , respectively (note that $dL=H^2$ ). I'm trying to show this, but I'm making a mistake somewhere in my reasoning - my question is where? Note that $i$ is proper, so $i_!=i_* $ . Then by Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch we have $$ \ch(i_* \oh_L)  \td(X) = i_*(\ch(\oh_L) \td (L)) . $$ I know that the Todd class of such $X$ can be given by $\td(X) = (1, \frac{1}{2}H, \frac{1}{12}(H^2 + c_2(X)), \frac{1}{24} H \cdot c_2(X))$ . I also know that we have $H \cdot c_2(X) = 24$ (but I think I should put some class after $24$ here - perhaps $24P$ ?), so the last entry of the Todd class of $X$ is $1$ (or $P$ ?). Also, $\ch(\oh_L) = 1$ and since $L$ is an algebraic curve with $L \cong \mathbb{P}^1$ , we have $\td(L) = 1 + c_1(L) = 1 - K_L = 1 + 2P$ (where here, $P$ is a point in $L$ as opposed to in $X$ ). We also know that $i_* \oh_L$ is a sheaf on $X$ supported in codimension $2$ , so it follows that $\mathrm{rk}(i_* \oh_L ) = 0$ and $c_1 (i_* \oh_L ) = 0$ . Furthermore, by this question , $c_2(i_* \oh_L) = L$ (using standard short exact sequence with ideal sheaf of $L$ ). So really, the only unknown Chern class is the third one. For the right hand side, I'm not really sure how to interpret what $i_* $ does to the $1+2P$ inside it - I assumed that it means we now consider $P$ as a point in $X$ , so the left hand side would be $i_*(1+2P) = 1+2P $ where now $P$ is a point class in $X$ - is this correct? Putting what we have together, we get (I'm letting $c_2 := c_2(i_* \oh_L)$ and $c_3 := c_3(i_* \oh_L)$ here): \begin{align}    ( -L + \frac{1}{2} c_3 )( 1 + \frac{1}{2} H + \frac{1}{12}(H^2 + c_2(X)) + P) = 1 + 2P \end{align} but this seems wrong, because this would mean that $L=0$ which is a contradiction, and also that $c_3=5P$ which doesn't match up.

This is equivalent to zero set of a single irreducible homogeneous polynomial) $V\subseteq\mathbb{P}^5$ such that $V\cap Y=C$ In here, $\rho$ is a map for $x=(x_0,x_1,x_2)$ , $\rho(x)=(M_0(x),\cdots,M_5(x))=(x_0^2,x_1^2,x_2^2,x_0x_1,x_1x_2,x_0x_2)$ Since curve is a hypersurface in $\mathbb{P}^2$ , there is a homogeneous irreducible polynomial $f\in k[x_0,x_1,x_2]$ ( $k$ is a field) such that $C=\rho(\mathcal{Z}(f))$ (zeros of $f$ ).

Let us call $X//G=Y$ . I'm interested in the following situation: $Z \subseteq Y$ is a closed subset (considered as a subvariety with the standard reduced structure). We consider the closed $G$ invariant subset $p^{-1}(Z)=W$ of $X$ : I'd like to prove that the map $p:W \to Z$ is actually a (categorical) quotient. This accounts to prove the following:we call $B$ the $k$ algebra $\mathcal{O}_X(X)$ . We then have $\mathcal{O}_Y(Y)=B^G$ . With this identification, the subscheme $Z$ corresponds to an ideal $I \subseteq B^G$ while $W$ corresponds to $\sqrt{IB}$ . We then want to prove that $$\dfrac{B^G}{I}=\left(\dfrac{B}{\sqrt{IB}}\right)^G .$$ We can think of $\sqrt{IB}$ as the function $f:X \to \mathbb{A}^1_k$ such that $f(p^{-1}(Z))=0$ .

In all cases, I can more or less see that there is something additive going on. But I have difficulty seeing how they intertwine. My question is: could someone explain in dummy language how these notions are related? --- Definitions --- Philosophical additivity. Algebraic K-theory is additive in the sense that it should convert short exact sequences into direct sums in some universal way. This is most easily seen in the definition of $K_0$ of a ring: a short exact sequence $0 \to M' \to M \to M''\to 0$ gets converted into a relation $M = M' \oplus M''$ in $K_0(R)$ .

One way to represent this lattice is as a set of generating vectors $v_1$ and $v_2$ . However, this is a non-unique representation, as multiple vectors generate the set. A better way to uniquely represent $\Lambda$ is to instead treat it as a lattice in $\Bbb C$ rather than in $\Bbb R^2$ . We can then uniquely represent the lattice using the two Eisenstein series $G_4$ and $G_6$ : $$ G_{2k}(\Lambda) = \sum_{0 \neq \omega \in \Lambda} \frac{1}{\omega^{2k}} $$ Since we are now treating the lattice vectors as complex numbers in $\Bbb C$ rather than vectors in $\Bbb R^2$ , the above will converge to a complex number. It is then known that for any lattice $\Lambda$ , the pair $(G_4(\Lambda), G_6(\Lambda))$ then uniquely represents the lattice. That is, we have that the map $$ \text{lattices} \to \Bbb C^2 \\ \Lambda \mapsto (G_4(\Lambda), G_6(\Lambda)) $$ is a bijection (including degenerate lattices). There are many descriptions of the above online: The Space of Lattices , Lorenz and modular flows: a visual introduction , n-Category Cafe: The Modular Flow on the Space of Lattices , etc. Serre’s A Course in Arithmetic, p. 89 is often cited. My question is : How can you do something similar for the space of lattices in $\Bbb R^3$ , or $\Bbb R^n$ in general? To get the Eisenstein series, we had to treat $\Bbb R^2$ as an algebra, so that we could take powers of vectors. Is there a different algebra, perhaps a Clifford algebra, that we can use on $\Bbb R^n$ to define a higher-dimensional analogue of the Eisenstein series? The reason I ask is that this representation is very natural. The axis with $(G_4(\Lambda), G_6(\Lambda)) = (1,0)$ represents the square lattice with 4-fold symmetry, and the axis with $(G_4(\Lambda), G_6(\Lambda)) = (0,1)$ represents the triangular lattice with 6-fold symmetry.

40,Geometric Interpretation of Automorphisms of Projective Bundles,Geometric Interpretation of Automorphisms of Projective Bundles,,"Let $\mathcal{E}$ be a rank three vector bundle on $\mathbb{P}^1$ . It splits as $\mathcal{E}\cong\mathcal{O}(a_1)\oplus\mathcal{O}(a_2)\oplus\mathcal{O}(a_3)$ . It's not hard to see that any automorphism of $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E})$ acts trivially on the Picard group, which is generated by the class $f$ of a fiber and the class $h$ of $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E})}(1)$ . In particular, because any automorphism takes fibers to fibers, we obtain a surjective map $\text{Aut}(\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E}))\rightarrow \text{Aut}(\mathbb{P}^1)$ . We get an exact sequence $$ 1\rightarrow G\rightarrow \text{Aut}(\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E}))\rightarrow \text{Aut}(\mathbb{P}^1)\rightarrow 1 $$ We think of $G$ as automorphisms that fix each fiber as a set and leave $\mathbb{P}^1$ fixed. Algebraically, we can see $G=\mathbb{P}\text{Aut}(\mathcal{E})$ . We have $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{E})\subset \text{End}(\mathcal{E})=H^0(\mathbb{P}^1,\mathcal{E}\otimes \mathcal{E}^{\vee})$ . We can view an element of $H^0(\mathbb{P}^1,\mathcal{E}\otimes \mathcal{E}^{\vee})$ as a $3\times 3$ matrix with entries $a_{ij}\in H^0(\mathbb{P}^1,\mathcal{O}(a_i-a_j))$ . I'd like to get my hands on what these automorphisms do in a geometric sense. It may be instructive to consider a specific example. Let $\mathcal{E}=\mathcal{O}(3)\oplus\mathcal{O}(3)\oplus\mathcal{O}(4)$ . Our matrix is $\begin{pmatrix}  a & b & 0 \\  c & d & 0 \\  l_1 & l_2 & e   \end{pmatrix} $ where $a,b,c,d,e$ are scalars and $l_1, l_2\in H^0(\mathbb{P}^1,\mathcal{O}(1))$ . The condition that this matrix defines an automorphism is that the determinant doesn't vanish, which just means that $(ad-bc)e\neq 0$ . After projectivizing, we can set $e=1$ .  Intuitively, this matrix breaks up in to a few parts. The top left $2\times 2$ block seems to be a $GL_2$ . The bottom left part is a $H^0(\mathcal{O}(1))^{\oplus 2}=\mathbb{A}^4$ . How can I interpret these parts of the matrix geometrically? What types of automorphisms do they correspond to? One idea I have is the following.

In particular, I want to practice proving the existence of a scheme satisfying a certain universal property by showing a corresponding functor is representable. The most common example of this in textbooks is the fibered product of schemes. If $X \rightarrow S$ and $Y \rightarrow S$ are schemes over $S$ , then to show that the fibered product over $S$ exists is to show that the functor $$ \hom(-, X) \times_{\hom(-, S)} \hom(-Y) $$ is representable.

Shorter version of the question: How can I describe explicit representatives for a basis for the singular homology $H_1(C(n),\mathbb{Q})$ ?

One can combine them to obtain cycles $$ \Delta_{r,s} := [\gamma_{0,s}-\gamma_{r,s}+\gamma_{r,0}-\gamma_{-r,0} + \gamma_{-r,-s}-\gamma_{0,-s}] \in H_1(C(n),\mathbb{Q})^-$$ that are anti-invariant under complex conjugation (that's what the $^-$ stands for), meaning that $\overline{\Delta_{r,s}}=-\Delta_{r,s}$ . My aim is to show that the $\Delta_{r,s}$ span $H_1(C(n),\mathbb{Q})^-$ , which has dimension equal to the genus $$g=\dfrac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}.$$ There are in principle enough elements. It's true that $\Delta_{r,0}=\Delta_{0,s}=0$ and that $\Delta_{-r,-s}=-\Delta_{r,s}$ and that $\Delta_{\frac{n}{2},\frac{n}{2}}=0$ for $n$ even, but one could in principle still find up to $$\left\lfloor  \frac{(n-1)^2}{2} \right\rfloor \ge g$$ cycles among the $\Delta_{r,s}$ , and based on computer calculations I have reason to believe that they actually span $H_1(C(n),\mathbb{Q})^-$ .

So I either need a direct argument or, if I can find a basis of $H_1(C(n),\mathbb{Q})$ , I could try to express the $\Delta_{r,s}$ in terms of this basis and see what comes out. The problem is that I do not have a nice way to visualize paths on the curve and describe them with explicit formulas.

50,Mapping Tori and Monodromy,Mapping Tori and Monodromy,,"I have a question regarding the right setup for mapping tori. Let me give the definitions that I use first. Let $I$ denote the interval $[0,2\pi]$ and let $I^*$ denote the quotient of $I$ by the relation $0 \sim 2\pi$. Further, let $F$ be a smooth manifold, $f \colon F \rightarrow F$ a diffeomorphism, and define an equivalence relation $\sim$ on $I \times F$ by $(0,x) \sim (2\pi,f(x))$. The Mapping Torus of $f$ is the manifold $E_f = (I \times F)/\sim$. It is not difficult to see that this is a locally trivial fibration over $I^*$. A map trivializing over $I^* \setminus \{\pi\}$ is, for instance, given by $$\psi([t,x]) = \begin{equation} \begin{cases} ([t],x), &\text{if } 0 \leq t < \pi \\ ([t],f^{-1}(x)), &\text{if } \pi < t \leq 2\pi. \end{cases} \end{equation}$$ A lot of references now claim that this fibration has monodromy $[f]$. First of all, to speak of monodromy we need to fix a loop. A natural choice would be $\gamma \colon S^1 \rightarrow I^*, ~\gamma(t) = [t]$. Let $q$ denote the obvious map $[0,2\pi] \rightarrow S^1$. Now the pullback bundle $E = (\gamma \circ q)^*E_f$ has a global trivialization given by $$h \colon F \times [0,2\pi] \rightarrow E, ~h(x,t) = (t,[t,x]).$$ We have that $h(x,0) = (0,[0,x])$ and, hence, viewed as a map $F \rightarrow E_0 \simeq F$, $h(\cdot,0)$ is exactly the identity $id_F$. Therefore, the monodromy associated to $\gamma$ is $h(\cdot,2\pi)$. However, this map $$h(x,2\pi) = (2\pi,[2\pi,x]) = (2\pi,[0,f^{-1}])$$ is actually $f^{-1}$, not $f$. Doing a similar calculation, we find that the monodromy associated to $\delta(t) = [2\pi-t]$ is actually $f$. In conclusion, we would have assumed that the most natural setup (i.e. using $\gamma$) would lead to monodromy $f$. If my calculations are correct, then this does not hold, though. So, the question is: should we define the mapping torus via the relation $(0,x) \sim (2\pi,f^{-1}(x))$ instead, or do the textbooks simply not communicate that the ""natural"" monodromy of $E_f$ actually is $f^{-1}$? (Of course, the implicit question ""Are my calculations corret?"" also stands...)","I have a question regarding the right setup for mapping tori. Let me give the definitions that I use first. Let $I$ denote the interval $[0,2\pi]$ and let $I^*$ denote the quotient of $I$ by the relation $0 \sim 2\pi$. Further, let $F$ be a smooth manifold, $f \colon F \rightarrow F$ a diffeomorphism, and define an equivalence relation $\sim$ on $I \times F$ by $(0,x) \sim (2\pi,f(x))$. The Mapping Torus of $f$ is the manifold $E_f = (I \times F)/\sim$. It is not difficult to see that this is a locally trivial fibration over $I^*$. A map trivializing over $I^* \setminus \{\pi\}$ is, for instance, given by $$\psi([t,x]) = \begin{equation} \begin{cases} ([t],x), &\text{if } 0 \leq t < \pi \\ ([t],f^{-1}(x)), &\text{if } \pi < t \leq 2\pi. \end{cases} \end{equation}$$ A lot of references now claim that this fibration has monodromy $[f]$.

He considers the function $\pi : C \to \Bbb{P}^1_{\Bbb{C}}$ given in affine coordinates by $(x, y) \mapsto x$ and $\infty \mapsto \infty$. $\pi$ is a double covering except over $\{0, 1, \lambda, \infty\}$. He then considers disjoint paths $01$ and $\lambda\infty$ with the indicated endpoints. Reid claims that if the parts of $C$ lying over these paths is removed, $C$ falls into two pieces. I.e., if we call the two paths $M$ and $N$, he is claiming that $E = C \setminus \pi^{-1}[M \cup N]$ has two connected components. After quite a long struggle, I believe I can now prove this claim using the theory of covering projections.  Here is a sketch of my proof. It is fairly easy to see that $\pi\mid_{E}$ is a (double) covering projection. Since the base $B = \Bbb{P}^1_{\Bbb{C}} \setminus (M \cup N)$ of this double cover is homeomorphic to $S^1 \times (0, 1)$, there are two possibilities: either $E$ is homeomorphic to $B$ and the double cover is induced by the double cover $z \mapsto z^2$ of $S^1$ or $E$ is homeomorphic to the disjoint union $B \sqcup B$ and the double cover is the trivial one that restricts to the identity on each component. What Reid is claiming is that the latter holds, so that there is a continuous map sending $x \in B$ to a $y$ such that $(x, y), (x, -y) \in C$, i.e., we have a continuous choice for $\sqrt{q(x)}$. To see that this holds, take $\alpha : S^1 \to B$ to be a generator of the fundamental group $\pi_1(B)$. We must show that $q \circ \alpha$ lifts to the double cover $z \mapsto z^2$ of $\Bbb{C} \setminus \{0\}$ (so that the lifting provides a value for $\sqrt{q(\alpha(s))}$ as a continuous function of $s \in S^1$). Now parametrise the paths $M$ and $N$ by continuous maps $\mu, \nu: [0, 1] \to \Bbb{P}^1_{\Bbb{C}}$ satisfying: $$\mu(0) = 1 \quad \mu(1) = 0 \quad \nu(0) = \lambda \quad\nu(1) = \infty$$ and, for $t \in [0, 1]$, put: $$ q_t(x) = x (x - \mu(t)) \left(\frac{\lambda x}{\nu(t)} - \lambda\right) $$ Then $q_t(x)$ has no roots on $B$ and hence we have a homotopy between $q = q_0$ and $q_1$ as maps $B \to \Bbb{C} \setminus \{0\}$. But $q_1(z) = -\lambda z^2$. So $q \circ \alpha$ has degree $2$ and does indeed lift to the double cover of $\Bbb{C} \setminus \{0\}$. I am interested to know whether my proof is the usual one and what alternatives there are. I would appreciate any relevant pointers to the literature.

71,Not sure about one step in the proof that closed immersions are affine (Hartshorne 3.11b),Not sure about one step in the proof that closed immersions are affine (Hartshorne 3.11b),,"This question is about showing that if $i: Y \longrightarrow X$ is a closed immersion of schemes with $X = \text{Spec }A$ affine, then $Y$ is affine. This question has had a lot of attention on this site already, particularly here and a question of my own here . I also wanted to ask about a different approach to this question, which is why I am hoping it's not considered a duplicate. First of all I should state the definition of closed immersion I am working with A morphism $i: Y \longrightarrow X$ is called a closed immersion if $i$ induces a homeomorphism between $Y$ and a closed subset of $X$, and the corresponding morphism of sheaves $i^{\#}: \mathcal{O}_{X} \longrightarrow i_{*}\mathcal{O}_{Y}$ is surjective. I have also proved the following result independently of this exercise, which actually subsumes one of the hints given. In particular, I have proven the following If $f: X \longrightarrow Y$ is an affine morphism, then for any affine open $\text{Spec }B \subseteq Y$, the preimage $f^{-1}(\text{Spec }B)$ is affine in $X$. Having already proved this, my task is drastically reduced. Here is what I know so far, which seems to be the standard approach to the problem. Let $p \in Y$ be a point and let $\text{Spec }B$ be an affine neighbourhood of $p$ in $Y$. Then by definition of the subspace topology on $Y$, there is an open set $U$ of $X$ with $\text{Spec }B = Y \cap U$. Since $U$ is open in $X = \text{Spec A}$, we can find an $g \in A$ so that $p \in Y \cap D(g)$. Since $i^{-1}(D(g)) = Y \cap D(g)$, my entire task is now reduced to showing that $D(g) \cap Y$ is affine in $Y$, since then I can apply the above result on affine morphisms to see that $Y$ itself is affine. This is where I am slightly confused. I have that $$ i|_{\text{Spec B}}: \text{Spec }B\longrightarrow \text{Spec A} $$ corresponds to a morphism of rings, say $$   \phi: A \longrightarrow B .         $$ Now it seems ""obvious"" to me, that $D(g) \cap Y$ is given by the affine set $\text{Spec }B_{\phi(g)}$. It seems to me that this could be argued in the usual way, by taking the fibered product $$ \text{Spec }B \times_{\text{Spec }A} D(g) \simeq \text{Spec }\left( B \otimes_{A} A_{g}  \right) \simeq \text{Spec }(B_{\phi(g)}). $$ My concern is whether this is rigorous in this context. I am just uncomfortable about the fact that we seem to have ""cheated"" by restricting $i$ to $\text{Spec B}$. Now the pullback isn't actually along $i$, but along $i|_{\text{Spec B}}$. Is this argument still valid here? Is that really all I have to say to show that $D(g) \cap Y$ is affine? I also wanted to ask about how to see this in a potentially more general setting. Earlier in Hartshorne, in Exercise 2.16(a), we learn the following definition If $X$ is a scheme and $f \in \Gamma(X, \mathcal{O}_{X})$ is a global section, then we define   $$ X_{f} = \{ p \in X : f_{p} \not \in \mathfrak{m}_{p}   \}. $$ The exercise there is to show that if $U = \text{Spec }B$ is affine in $X$, then $X_{f} \cap U = D\left( \tilde{f} \right)$, where $\tilde{f} \in \Gamma(\text{Spec }B, \mathcal{O}_{X})$ is the restriction of $f$ to $\text{Spec }B$. It was suggested to me that if we generalize this exercise to the case where $\text{Spec }B$ is not a subscheme of $X$, but rather just any affine scheme with a morphism $\text{Spec }B \longrightarrow X$, then this intersection can be viewed as a fibered product, and the result is much more useful for the exercise I was trying to do above. This seems at least reasonable to me, since if $U = \text{Spec }B \subseteq Y$ was my affine scheme of the closed subscheme $Y$ defined above, then wanting to show that $Y \cap D(g)$ is affine seems very reminiscent of this exercise, although I can't see the details of how this works. So my question can be summed up as follows If $i: Y \longrightarrow X$ is our closed immersion defined above, then to what extend can the statement that $D(g) \cap Y$ is affine be regarded as a generalization of exercise 2.16(a) where instead of $\text{Spec }B \hookrightarrow X$ being an immersion, it is an arbitrary morphism?","This question is about showing that if $i: Y \longrightarrow X$ is a closed immersion of schemes with $X = \text{Spec }A$ affine, then $Y$ is affine.

I also wanted to ask about a different approach to this question, which is why I am hoping it's not considered a duplicate. First of all I should state the definition of closed immersion I am working with A morphism $i: Y \longrightarrow X$ is called a closed immersion if $i$ induces a homeomorphism between $Y$ and a closed subset of $X$, and the corresponding morphism of sheaves $i^{\#}: \mathcal{O}_{X} \longrightarrow i_{*}\mathcal{O}_{Y}$ is surjective. I have also proved the following result independently of this exercise, which actually subsumes one of the hints given. In particular, I have proven the following If $f: X \longrightarrow Y$ is an affine morphism, then for any affine open $\text{Spec }B \subseteq Y$, the preimage $f^{-1}(\text{Spec }B)$ is affine in $X$. Having already proved this, my task is drastically reduced. Here is what I know so far, which seems to be the standard approach to the problem. Let $p \in Y$ be a point and let $\text{Spec }B$ be an affine neighbourhood of $p$ in $Y$. Then by definition of the subspace topology on $Y$, there is an open set $U$ of $X$ with $\text{Spec }B = Y \cap U$. Since $U$ is open in $X = \text{Spec A}$, we can find an $g \in A$ so that $p \in Y \cap D(g)$. Since $i^{-1}(D(g)) = Y \cap D(g)$, my entire task is now reduced to showing that $D(g) \cap Y$ is affine in $Y$, since then I can apply the above result on affine morphisms to see that $Y$ itself is affine. This is where I am slightly confused. I have that $$ i|_{\text{Spec B}}: \text{Spec }B\longrightarrow \text{Spec A} $$ corresponds to a morphism of rings, say $$   \phi: A \longrightarrow B .         $$ Now it seems ""obvious"" to me, that $D(g) \cap Y$ is given by the affine set $\text{Spec }B_{\phi(g)}$. It seems to me that this could be argued in the usual way, by taking the fibered product $$ \text{Spec }B \times_{\text{Spec }A} D(g) \simeq \text{Spec }\left( B \otimes_{A} A_{g}  \right) \simeq \text{Spec }(B_{\phi(g)}). $$ My concern is whether this is rigorous in this context. I am just uncomfortable about the fact that we seem to have ""cheated"" by restricting $i$ to $\text{Spec B}$. Now the pullback isn't actually along $i$, but along $i|_{\text{Spec B}}$. Is this argument still valid here? Is that really all I have to say to show that $D(g) \cap Y$ is affine? I also wanted to ask about how to see this in a potentially more general setting. Earlier in Hartshorne, in Exercise 2.16(a), we learn the following definition If $X$ is a scheme and $f \in \Gamma(X, \mathcal{O}_{X})$ is a global section, then we define   $$ X_{f} = \{ p \in X : f_{p} \not \in \mathfrak{m}_{p}   \}. $$ The exercise there is to show that if $U = \text{Spec }B$ is affine in $X$, then $X_{f} \cap U = D\left( \tilde{f} \right)$, where $\tilde{f} \in \Gamma(\text{Spec }B, \mathcal{O}_{X})$ is the restriction of $f$ to $\text{Spec }B$. It was suggested to me that if we generalize this exercise to the case where $\text{Spec }B$ is not a subscheme of $X$, but rather just any affine scheme with a morphism $\text{Spec }B \longrightarrow X$, then this intersection can be viewed as a fibered product, and the result is much more useful for the exercise I was trying to do above. This seems at least reasonable to me, since if $U = \text{Spec }B \subseteq Y$ was my affine scheme of the closed subscheme $Y$ defined above, then wanting to show that $Y \cap D(g)$ is affine seems very reminiscent of this exercise, although I can't see the details of how this works. So my question can be summed up as follows If $i: Y \longrightarrow X$ is our closed immersion defined above, then to what extend can the statement that $D(g) \cap Y$ is affine be regarded as a generalization of exercise 2.16(a) where instead of $\text{Spec }B \hookrightarrow X$ being an immersion, it is an arbitrary morphism?",,"['algebraic-geometry', 'proof-verification', 'schemes', 'affine-schemes', 'closed-map']"

This sits in the following diagram: {alg. sets in $\mathbb P^n = \mathbb A^n \cup \mathbb P^{n-1}$} $\hspace 0.8cm$ $\longleftrightarrow$ $\hspace 1cm$ {alg. sets in $\mathbb A^n$} $\hspace 1.5cm$ $\uparrow$ $\hspace 7cm$ $\uparrow$ {homog ideals in $k[x_0, ..., x_n]$} $\hspace 0.5cm$ $\longleftrightarrow$ $\hspace 0.8cm$ {ideals in $k[x_1, ..., x_n]$} Here the top arrow from the left to the right is taking intersection with $\mathbb A^n$ and the other direction is taking the topological closure in $\mathbb P^n$. Both the maps upwards are taking the zero locus of the respective ideals. The maps at the bottom are homogenization of an ideal with respect to $x_0$ (see http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HomogeneousIdeal.html ), and in the other direction dehomogenization, by setting $x_0=1$. My question is, is there any connection between this homogenization and the previous diagram? Now, as I said, there's another operation called saturation that takes an homogeneous ideal in $k[x_0, ..., x_n]$ and gives an homogeneous ideal in $k[x_0, ..., x_n]$. This is defined by $\bar I = \{f \in k[x_0, ..., x_n], \exists\ m\ s.t. \forall\ i\ x_i^m s \in I \}$ To be honest I haven't really understood what is happening here and I haven't found much on it, so I don't know whether it is at all connected to the previous stuff. If anyone had some insight on this I would be very thankful. For example I don't know whether the fact that it is called saturation means, that it comes from the saturation with respect to some equivalence relation. I know, that it is needed to get a 1 to 1 correspondence between projective subschemes of $\mathbb P^n$ and homogeneous ideals in $k[x_0, ..., x_n]$, modulo having the same saturation. I'm very thankful to anyone, who read through this whole text and even more if they can help me. Btw. this whole problem started, when I tried to write down an equation for a line through two points in $\mathbb P^2$ and realized that I have no clue about what I'm doing.",,"['algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra']"

I had to show that for every $s \in \mathscr{E}(S)$ we can find a closed subscheme of $S$, $V(s)$ such that a morphism $Y \xrightarrow{f} S$ factorizes through $V(s)$ if and only if $f^{*}(s)=0$. To do this I tried to define the ""vanishing set"" of the section using the set of points where the ""coordinates"" of $s$ lie in the maximal ideal but I had problems to finish the proof. However we can give a more geometrical interpretation: $\mathbb{V}(\mathscr{E})(X \xrightarrow{id} X)=\mathscr{E}(X)$ therefore we can identify global sections of the sheaf with global sections of the bundle. Now we note that $f^{*}\mathscr{E}$ is also locally free therefore it defines a bundle $\vert f^{*}\mathscr{E} \vert \xrightarrow{\pi'} Y$ and this bundle is the pullback of $\pi$ and $f$. The composition $s \circ f$ yields a section as pictured below Now the condition $f^{*}(s)=0$ translates to the fact that the associated section we have constructed equals to the zero section of $\vert f^{*} \mathscr{E}\vert$. Let us denote the zero sections of both spaces by $0_S,0_Y$. If we define $V(s)$ as the pullback of $s,0_S$ we obtain the desired subspace and the factorization property is encoded in the universal property of the pullback. Furthermore this subscheme is unique. This seems very nice theoretically but not very useful in practice.
