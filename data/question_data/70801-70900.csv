0,A curious compactness confusion: space filling curves in the hilbert cube that contradict a bona fide theorem?,A curious compactness confusion: space filling curves in the hilbert cube that contradict a bona fide theorem?,,"Now, I may have only slept two hours last night and would currently struggle to discern a 'proof' by induction of FLT from a piece of genuine mathematics, but that doesn't stop mathematics from bugging me. At present I am puzzled by something I saw on MO this morning ... The linked question concerns the Hilbert cube $[0,1]^\mathbb{N}$ (an infinite product of intervals) and the existence of space filling curves thereof- that is: continuous images of the unit circle that are surjections on the Hilbert cube. The accepted answer , together with another answer (which actually constructs such a map) and various comments, seems to allude toward an answer in the affirmative. However, the linked theorem (the 'Hahn–Mazurkiewicz theorem') which states: A nonempty Hausdorff topological space is a continuous image of the unit interval if and only if it is a compact, connected, locally connected second-countable space. seems in direct contradiction to this since (and I may be mistaken for reasons explained above): The Hilbert cube is a subset of a normed space and hence a metric space The sequence $(1,0,0...), (0,1,0...), (0,0,1,...)$ has no convergent subsequence So the Hilbert cube is not sequentially compact, therefore non-compact (the two are equivalent in metric spaces). Which seems at odds with the only if portion of the theorem's statement. Maybe this is wikipedia taking me for a ride. Maybe I am just hallucinating a portion of this argument. Either way, this is annoying me. Thanks in advance for clearing this up...","Now, I may have only slept two hours last night and would currently struggle to discern a 'proof' by induction of FLT from a piece of genuine mathematics, but that doesn't stop mathematics from bugging me.

Then there is some open interval $(a,b)$ such that $$u \in (a,b) \subset A.$$ Now if $\mathbb{R} - A$ is not empty either, then let $v \in \mathbb{R} - A$. Then there is some open interval $(c,d)$ such that  $$v \in (c,d) \subset \mathbb{R} - A.$$ Suppose that $u < v$. Since $$\emptyset \subset (a,b) \cap (c,d) \subset A \cap (\mathbb{R} - A) = \emptyset,$$ we must have $$(a,b) \cap (c,d) = \emptyset.$$ So we can conlclude that $$b \leq c.$$ But $b \in A$ and $c \in \mathbb{R} - A$.

Now, I am a little bit confused about the following: There is also the notion of manifolds with corners , i.e. second countable Hausdorff spaces, which are locally homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^{d}=[0,\infty)^{d}=\{x\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\mid x_{i}\geq 0\}$ . I am aware of the fact that topologically, manifolds with corners are one and the same as topological manifolds with boundary , since the space $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^{d}$ is homeomorphic to the model space of manifolds with boundary, i.e. the half-plane $\mathbb{H}^{d}=[0,\infty)\times\mathbb{R}^{d-1}$ . This is no longer true in the differentiable setting, since these two sets are not diffeomorphic. However, in my question I do not care about differentiability, but I am only thinking about the topological category. So, in other words, every manifold with corners is in particular a (topological) manifold with boundary. So, it should also be true that the boundary of every such manifold is by itself a manifold with empty boundary, right? I mean, the Theorem mentioned at the beginning is for arbitrary manifolds with boundary and the notion of boundary is a purely topological object and has nothing to do with a differentiable structure. Now, when I think for example about the solid cylinder, i.e. the manifold with corner defined by $C:=D^{2}\times [0,1]$ , where $D^{2}$ is the disk (=closed 2-ball), then its boundary is clearly $$\partial C=(\partial(D^{2})\times [0,1])\cup (D^{2}\times\partial [0,1])=(S^{1}\times [0,1])\cup (D^{2}\times\{0,1\}).$$ But this is not a topological manifold without boundary right?

In this case we define the only one morphism $\phi_{UV}:U\rightarrow V$, that includes naturally $U$ into $V$.

I would like to know if minor disturbances in the  function $ f $ could only cause minor disturbances in the  fixed point $ x $ of $ f $ . In other words the question would be as follows. If a  function $ g $ is close to $ f $ then will the fixed points of $ f $ be close to the fixed points of $ g $ ? One problem with this question is that the number of  fixed points of $ g $ may be greater or less than the number of  fixed points of $ f $ . Thus, there may be a fixed point $ x_f $ of $ f $ such that $ g (x) \neq x $ to $ x $ in some neighborhood of $ x_f $ . However the Brouwer's fixed-point theorem guarantees that the number of fixed points of $ g $ is always greater than or equal to $ 1 $ .

If $X$ is not limit point compact, then let $A$ be an infinite subset of $X$ such that $A$ has no limit point in $X$ . Let $$ B \colon= \left\{ b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots \right\} $$ be a countably infinite subset of $A$ . Since we have assumed that $A$ has no limit point in $X$ and since $B \subset A$ , therefore $B$ has no limit point in $X$ either. So, the set $B^\prime$ of all the limit points of $B$ in $X$ is empty and thus contained in $B$ ; hence $B$ is closed in $X$ . Since $B$ has no limit points in $X$ and since $B \subset X$ , none of the elements of the set $B$ itself is a limit point of $B$ ; so for each element $b_n \in B$ , there is an open set $U_n$ in $X$ such that $$ U_n \cap B = \left\{b_n \right\} \tag{1} .$$ Now the collection $$ \left\{ \ U_n \ \colon \ n \in \mathbb{N} \ \right\} \bigcup \{ X-B \} $$ forms a countable open covering of the countably compact space $X$ , so some finite subcollection of this covering also covers $X$ and hence that finite subcollection also covers $B$ . But the set $X-B$ contains no point of $B$ . So $B$ is covered by finitely many of the sets $$ \left\{ \ U_n \ \colon \ n \in \mathbb{N} \ \right\}, $$ each of which contains exactly one point of set $B$ [Refer to (1) above.]. This implies that set $B$ is a finite set, contrary to our choice of $B$ . Hence $X$ is limit point compact. Is this proof correct? How to prove the converse? PS: From the above proof (where we haven't required $X$ to be a T $_1$ -space), we can even state the following: Every (countably) compact topological space $X$ is also limit point compact. Am I right? P.S.: Based on the answers below, I state and prove the following result: Let $X$ be a $T_1$ topological space. If $X$ is limit point compact, then $X$ is also countably compact. Proof: Suppose that $X$ is a limit point compact, $T_1$ topological space that is not countably compact. Then there is a countable open covering $\left\{ \ U_n \ \colon \ n \in \mathbb{N} \ \right\}$ of $X$ that has no finite subcollection that also covers $X$ . Let us define the collection $\left\{ \ V_n \ \colon \ n \in \mathbb{N} \ \right\}$ of sets as follows: $$ V_n \colon= \begin{cases} U_1 \ & \mbox{ if } \ n = 1, \\ V_{n-1} \cup U_n \ & \mbox{ if } \ n = 2, 3, 4, \ldots. \end{cases} $$ That is, $$ \begin{align}  V_1 & \colon= U_1, \\  V_2 & \colon= U_1 \cup U_2, \\  V_3 & \colon= U_1 \cup U_2 \cup U_3, \\  V_4 & \colon= U_1 \cup U_2 \cup U_3 \cup U_4, \\      & \cdots \\ \end{align} $$ We note that $$ V_1 \subset V_2 \subset V_3 \subset \cdots. \tag{1} $$ For each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ , as $U_n \subset V_n \subset X $ and as $$ \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty U_n = X, \tag{2} $$ so we must also have $$ \bigcup_{n = 1}^\infty V_n = X. \tag{2*} $$ Thus $\left\{ \ V_n \ \colon \ n \in \mathbb{N} \ \right\}$ is also a countable open covering of $X$ . Now as $V_1 = U_1$ is a proper subset of $X$ [Refer to the first paragraph of this proof.], so there exists a point $x_1 \in X \setminus V_1$ . In fact, the set $X \setminus V_1$ is an infinite set, becuase if this set were finite, then  the open covering $\left\{ \ U_n \ \colon \ n \in \mathbb{N} \ \right\}$ of $X$ would have a finite subcollection also covering $X$ . Suppose that $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $n > 1$ , and suppose that the $n-1$ distinct points $x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1} \in X$ have been chosen. Using the same reasoning as in the paragraph preceding the last one, the set $V_n = U_1 \cup \cdots \cup U_n$ is a proper subset of $X$ [Refer to the first paragraph of this proof again.] and as  the set $X \setminus V_n$ is an infinite set; so there exists a point $x_n \in X \setminus V_n$ such that $x_n \neq x_j$ for any $j = 1, \ldots, n-1$ . In this way we obtain the infinite subset $S$ of $X$ given by $$ S \colon= \left\{ \ x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots \ \right\}. \tag{3} $$ Furthermore we note that, for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$ , as $x_n \not\in V_n$ , and as $V_n \supset V_j$ for each $j = 1, \ldots, n$ , by virtue of (1) above, so we can also conclude, for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ , the following: $$ x_n \not\in V_j  \mbox{ for any } j = 1 \ldots n. \tag{4} $$ Since $X$ is limit point compact, the infinite set $S$ of $X$ as defined in (3) above in the paragraph prior to the preceding paragraph has a limit point $p$ in $X$ . Now using (2*) above, as $$ p \in X = \bigcup_{n = 1}^ \infty V_n, $$ so there exists a natural number $r$ such that $p \in V_r$ ; let $r$ be the smallest such natural number. Now as $p$ is a limit point in $X$ of set $S$ and as $V_r$ is an open set of $X$ containing $p$ , so $$ V_r \cap \big( S \setminus \{ p \} \big) \neq \emptyset, $$ that is, there exists an element $x_k$ of $S \setminus \{ p \}$ such that $x_k \in V_r$ also. Thus we have $x_k \in V_r$ . But by (4) above as $x_k \not\in V_k$ , so $$ V_r \not\subset V_k, $$ and hence in view of (1) above we can conclude that $$ r \not\leq k, $$ which implies that $$ r > k , $$ that is [Note that $x_k \in S$ . Refer to (3) above.], $$ k \in \{ 1, \ldots, r-1 \}. $$ Therefore the open set $V_r$ containing the limit point $p$ of set $S$ can intersect $S$ in only finitely nany points. But since $X$ is a $T_1$ space, $V_r$ must intersect $S$ in infinitely many points, by Theorem 17.9 in Munkres. Thus we have a contradiction. Thus if a $T_1$ topological space $X$ is limit point compact, then $X$ is also countably compact. Is this proof correct and clear enough in its presentation?

I guess he also stumbled across the introduction of the category of open subsets of a topological space X (denoted by $Op_X$) in Pierre Schapira's lecture notes on Algebra and Topology (or one of his sources). There you can read: Let $X$ be a topological space. The family of open subsets of $X$ is ordered by inclusion and we denote by $Op_X$ the associated category. Hence: $$\mathrm{Hom}_{Op_X}(U,V) =\begin{cases} \{\text{pt}\} & \text{if }U \subset V,\\  \emptyset & \text{otherwise.} \end{cases}$$ Okay, $\{\text{pt}\}$ is simply defined beforehand as a set with one single element, I get that. $U$ and $V$ are open subsets of $X$ obviously, that's okay with me, too. What I don't get is: Why ""hence"" - isn't that pure definition? Or is it more like ""so the only possible/useful/... definition of the $\text{Hom}$-sets is: [...]""? So, if $U \subset V$, we have one morphism $pt:U\to V$. I feel like everybody knows which morphism this is, but I don't see it. What does $pt$ do? Is this the identity-morphism, namely $pt(u)=u ~~\forall u\in U$ (which would include $U$ in $V$ if $U\subset V$, which would make sense somehow)? If my guess is wrong, then we must at least have some kind of unique morphism, which we can always find if $U\subset V$. But how do we get that one (or its existence)? (I somehow feel like this has got something to do with fhyve 's argument about isomorphisms mentioned in the question linked above. I think I understood why we have isomorphisms in that situation, but I don't see a connection to why $Op_X$ is a category or to why/how we have that $pt$-morphism. Also another user states that $pt$ is the inclusion map. Is that correct and is the inclusion map the same as what I guessed a few lines above?)
