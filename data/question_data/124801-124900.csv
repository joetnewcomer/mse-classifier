I found the proof of this theorem on this page (at the bottom of the page), but I was not able to fully understand it, could you help me?

P.S. in the above-linked Terry blogpost on Brauer-Fowler , Terry does say ...the actual proof of the CFSG does not quite proceed along these lines. However, a significant portion of the argument is based on a generalisation of this strategy, in which the concept of a centraliser of an involution is replaced by the more general notion of a normaliser of a {p}-group, and one studies not just a single normaliser but rather the entire family of such normalisers and how they interact with each other (and in particular, which normalisers of {p}-groups commute with each other), motivated in part by the theory of Tits buildings for Lie groups... So perhaps I am giving the centralizer-strategy a little too much credit. But Terry's blogpost on the Frobenius and Suzuki theorems linked this very detailed (and a bit technical) survey by Solomon , and Ctrl-F ""CG"" finds occurences of centralizers $C_G(\bullet)$ all over the place (along with of course other fancier subgroups: Fitting subgroup, Thompson subgroup, maximal normal semisimple subgroups, generalized Fitting subgroups, p-layer subgroups, etc.).

P.S. in the above-linked Terry blogpost on Brauer-Fowler , Terry does say ...the actual proof of the CFSG does not quite proceed along these lines. However, a significant portion of the argument is based on a generalisation of this strategy, in which the concept of a centraliser of an involution is replaced by the more general notion of a normaliser of a {p}-group, and one studies not just a single normaliser but rather the entire family of such normalisers and how they interact with each other (and in particular, which normalisers of {p}-groups commute with each other), motivated in part by the theory of Tits buildings for Lie groups... So perhaps I am giving the centralizer-strategy a little too much credit. But Terry's blogpost on the Frobenius and Suzuki theorems linked this very detailed (and a bit technical) survey by Solomon , and Ctrl-F ""CG"" finds occurences of centralizers all over the place (along with of course other fancier subgroups: Fitting subgroup, Thompson subgroup, maximal normal semisimple subgroups, generalized Fitting subgroups, p-layer subgroups, etc.). Regardless, I think the main body of my post makes it clear that the centralizer-strategy was quite important and pursued/utilized in many different areas, and I would appreciate any insight as to why.",C_G(\bullet),"['group-theory', 'finite-groups', 'simple-groups', 'big-picture']"

12,Impossible permutations of the Gear Cube,Impossible permutations of the Gear Cube,,"If you're familiar with the group properties of the Rubik's Cube, you will probably know that, under the action of the standard moves, all possible permutations of the (unoriented) edge pieces are possible and all possible permutations of the (unoriented) corner pieces are possible, but because the action on these two sets is not independent, not all combinations of these are possible -- it turns out that the permutations on the two sets need to have the same sign.  I am interested in understanding the similar restrictions that exist on the Gear Cube. In case you're not familiar with a Gear Cube, it's structure is similar to a Rubik's cube except that it is geared in such a way that a half turn of any face elicits a quarter turn of the adjacent middle slice.  A quarter turn of a face is not therefore possible as the middle slice would be misaligned, as in the picture below. This sounds complicated, but in fact the restriction to half turns of faces, simplifies things in lots of ways.  For example, the 8 corners split into two sets (tetrahedrons) of 4, which never intermingle, and orientation is never an issue. the 12 edge pieces split into three sets (planes) of 4, which never intermingle. I should also add that there is some gearing on the orientation of the edge pieces, which again looks complicated at first but ultimately all it means is that the orientation of the edges is trivial and we don't need to worry about it. I've approached the problem by considering one corner (right-back-down) as fixed, and considering the actions of the group generated by a clockwise (half) turn of the left(L), front(F) and upper(U) faces.  This restricts the number of moves to worry about and also fixes the planes in which the edge pieces move.  The disadvantage is it allows the centre pieces to move, and ultimately it is the restriction on this movement that's causing me the most difficulty. As with a normal Rubik's Cube, the centres are fixed in space relative to each other and as such their permutations are exactly the rotations of a solid Cube. This is $S_4$, and is normally seen to be such by considering the action on the diagonals. Note that these permutations determine the permutations of the 3 main axes, which is essentially $S_3$ and can be considered as a quotient of the $S_4$ mentioned earlier. Various other sets of 4 seem to behave similarly.  The action on one particular set of 4 edges can be thought of as acting on the vertical sides, horizontal sides and diagonals of the square they form, again giving $S_3$ as a quotient of $S_4$. Perhaps more surprisingly the permutations of the tetrahedron with the fixed corner operates as a quotient of the permutations of the tetrahedron of free corners. It turns out the overall group action on each of the sets of 3 is the same, so for example if we fix the tetrahedron with the fixed corner we also fix the axes of centres.  However the sets of 4 do not match up in the same way, for example a full rotation of a face fixes the corners, but not the centres and one of the edge planes. Apparently, the permutations of the edges fixes the centres, but I cannot prove this.  Has anyone got any ideas? I've tried looking at the $S_4$s from the point of view of $S_3 \rtimes V_4$, thinking that the fact that all the $S_3$s were the same would help, but it hasn't much.  The behaviour of the $V_4$ bit still seems very complicated. I hope all that made some sense to someone.  Any help much appreciated! EDIT Perhaps I can put it another way.  The group is generated by 3 moves, $F$, $L$ and $U$, which can be regarded as acting on five 4-element sets: 4 free corners, the 4 cube diagonals associated with the movement of the centres, and three sets of 4 edge pieces. Thus the group can be regarded as a subgroup of $(S_4)^5$, with generators as follows: $$ L=((12), (1423), (12), (12), (1324)) \\ F=((14), (1243), (23), (1342), (23)) \\ U=((13), (1234), (1432), (13), (13)) \\ $$ By considering other actions, I came to consider the quotient of each copy of $S_4$ with its normal subgroup $V_4= \{e, (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23)\}$.  It seemed like a significant breakthrough that for each generator there was a distinct coset in $\cfrac{S_4}{V_4}$ in which all its coordinates lay: $(12)V_4$, $(23)V_4$, $(13)V_4$ for $L$, $F$, $U$ respectively.  This means that effectively each element of the group can be expressed as an element of $S_3\times (V_4)^5$, which is a lot smaller than $(S_4)^5$, but still 4 times bigger than what I believe to be the answer I'm aiming for. That's pretty much where I'm stuck, as the way the group acts on $S_3\times (V_4)^5$ is not straightforward. UPDATE Having done a bit more reading, it seems that the missing tool I need is Schreier's lemma . Essentially the idea is that given a subgroup  $H \subset G=<s_1, ..., s_n>$ we choose a single representative $t_j$ from each coset of $H$ in $G$ and then perform a simple calculation on each $s_i, t_j$ pair to create a set $\{u_{ij}\}$, which the lemma tells us generates $H$. So we can take $H$ to be the '$(V_4)^5$' bit of the group which fixes the $S_3$ component (by fixing one/all of the 3-element sets described earlier), thereby giving us a generator set for just this '$(V_4)^5$' bit with the '$S_3$' bit disentagled, as I was wanting above.  Our original group has 3 generators and $H$ has 6 cosets (one for each element of $S_3$), so there are 18 calculations, which even done manually is fairly manageable if somewhat tedious. Ignoring the repeats, we actually get a generator in $(V_4)^5$ with 13 elements.  The next step is to fix each $V_4$ in turn (by fixing one of the 4-element sets described earlier) in order to simplify things further. On the face of it the next step will have 4$\times$13 calculations, but they're much easier now we're working in $V_4$ and because it's Abelian some can immediately be identified as reordered repeats of other calculations. In this manner, I got down to the $(V_4)^2$ bit of the group in question being generated by $\{(a,a), (b,b)\}$ from which it can easily be seen that the permutation of the final 4-element set is completely determined by the others, as required. So that pretty much answers the question, albeit in a rather cumbersome computational way.  I suspect there may be a more elegant solution in terms of group actions, so I'd still be interested if anyone can think of one!","If you're familiar with the group properties of the Rubik's Cube, you will probably know that, under the action of the standard moves, all possible permutations of the (unoriented) edge pieces are possible and all possible permutations of the (unoriented) corner pieces are possible, but because the action on these two sets is not independent, not all combinations of these are possible -- it turns out that the permutations on the two sets need to have the same sign.

For a fixed $\lambda \in \Lambda$ and for any $\omega \in \Omega$, $$ (\lambda, \omega) = \operatorname{id}(\lambda, \omega) = q^\ast(\lambda, \omega) = (\lambda, q\omega)$$ and conclude that $q = \operatorname{id}_\Omega$. But I think this means that $q$ belongs to the intersection of all the stabilizers and doesn't mean $q = 1_Q$. What am I missing?",,"['group-theory', 'wreath-product']"

Its elements, the isometries associated with the Euclidean metric, are called Euclidean motions. From what I am aware, isometries include translations, rotations and reflections. However later on in the Wiki article it talks about dimensionality and degrees of freedom: Dimensionality The number of degrees of freedom for E(n) is n(n + 1)/2, which gives 3 in case n = 2, and 6 for n = 3. Of these, n can be attributed to available translational symmetry, and the remaining n(n − 1)/2 to rotational symmetry. I was confused as to why reflections did not factor in here, although intuitively I didn't see how a reflection could be a degree of freedom either. There just seems to be something different about reflections compared with translations and rotations, although I'm not sure what (not very mathematical, I know) After reading about Classification of Euclidean plane isometries on Stack exchange, one of the answers described how you could describe any isometry by a translation, rotation and reflection by considering three points: use a translation to map one point onto its image, a rotation to map the second point to its image, and finally a reflection to match the third. From this I can see how once the translation and rotation are used to match two points, the reflection used for the third is entirely determined by the isomatry- there is no more freedom in choosing the reflection, if you have used a translation and rotation to specify the mapping of two of the points. For an isometry, the final step is fixed. This kind of makes sense to me, although I am not sure if it is the best way, or even a correct way, of thinking about this. Also, the answer also stated that A non-zero translation and a non-zero rotation together are simply a rotation around some other center. A rotation followed by a reflection is a reflection in some different line. (MvG) So it seems that all combinations of translations and rotations can be described by a single reflection? So reflections 'hide' all of the degrees of freedom? I think this is related to the final point, but I admit I do not quite understand it.

For example, if we take one single permutation $$ p(1,\dots,n) = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & \dots & n\\ 1 & 2 & 3 & \dots & n \end{pmatrix} $$ We now have $n$ modifications of this single permutation by adding the symbol $(n+1)$: \begin{align} p(1,2,\dots,n,(n+1))&= \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & \dots & n & (n+1)\\ 1 & 2 & \dots & n & (n+1) \end{pmatrix}\\ p(2,1,\dots,n,(n+1))&= \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & \dots & n & (n+1)\\ 2 & 1 & \dots & n & (n+1) \end{pmatrix}\\ \vdots\\ p(n,2,\dots,1,(n+1))&= \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & \dots & n & (n+1)\\ n & 2 & \dots & 1 & (n+1) \end{pmatrix}\\ p((n+1),2,\dots,n,1)&= \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & \dots & n & (n+1)\\ (n+1) & 2 & \dots & n & 1 \end{pmatrix} \end{align} There are actually $(n+1)$ permutations of that specific form, but we take $p(1,\dots,n)=p(1,\dots,n,(n+1))$ in order to illustrate and prove our original statement. We can make this general equality for all $n!$ permutations: $p(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n)=p(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n,x_{n+1})$ where $x_i$ is any symbol of our finite set of $n$ symbols and $x_{n+1}$ is strictly defined as the symbol $(n+1)$. We can repeat this process for all $n!$ permutations in $S_n$. This gives us $n!n$ permutations. Then, adding in the original $n!$ permutations, we have $n!n+n!=(n+1)n!=(n+1)!$. Consequently, $S_n$ has order $n!$. How is my reasoning here? Furthermore, is there a more elegant argument? I do not really see my argument here as incorrect , it just seems to lack elegance. My reasoning may well be very incorrect, however. If so, please point it out to me.","I have been working on this exercise for a while now. It's in B.L. van der Waerden's Algebra (Volume I) , page $19$. The exercise is as follows: The order of the symmetric group $S_n$ is $n!=\prod_{1}^{n}\nu$. (Mathematical induction on $n$.) I don't comprehend how we can logically use induction here. It seems that the first step would be proving $S_1$ has $1!=1$ elements. This is simply justified: There is only one permutation of $1$, the permutation of $1$ to itself. The next step would be assuming that $S_n$ has order $n!$. Now here is where I get stuck.
