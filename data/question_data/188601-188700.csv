36,About the nature of continuity of trigonometric functions and equality,About the nature of continuity of trigonometric functions and equality,,"I was recently somewhat confused by the result of an exercise from a textbook that read: Question How many solutions are there to the equation $(\tan x)\sin^2(2x)=\cos x$ , $-2\pi \leq x \leq 2\pi$ ? Correct choice [[ from a multiple choice question ]] 8 Explanation: Using your GDC to graph the two functions $y=(\tan x)\sin^2(2x)$ and $y=\cos x$ and counting the intersection points over the interval $[-2\pi , 2\pi]$ This is however contrary to what my original answer was, which is $4$ . After some research, asking a teacher, and briefly consulting a tutor from the textbook's company, I am still in doubt concerning where my approach is flawed. It is thence that I approach this community in hopes that someone can lead me to a realization or comment on my procedure. My best guess is that maybe I have conceptualized something wrong, maybe to do with limits, or the nature of equality(?). At any rate, I am humbly lost and it would be very gracious from any of you to help, I would really appreciate it. So here we go: Relevant ideas and concepts considered under my approach Equality of functions To my knowledge, in order for two functions to be defined as equal (and thus be mathematically the same, even if represented differently) their domains must be formally equal to each other. Equality of sets To my knowledge, the following is accurate and varitable: Two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements.

Alternatively, but in a similar fashion, one can build the set $f \cap g$ and determine its cardinality. Relevant, however, is that $f(x)$ has its domain restricted further by the nature of the function $\tan(x)$ , which is undefined for any value where $x=\frac{(2n-1)\pi}{2}$ for any integer $n$ . Graphically, $\tan(x)$ presents asymptotic behaviour at $x=\frac{(2n-1)\pi}{2}$ . Let $\mathbb S=\lbrace\frac{-3\pi}{2},\frac{-\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{3\pi}{2}\rbrace$ , the set of x-coordinates where $tan(x)$ presents asymptotes under the restricted domain $[-2\pi,2\pi]$ . Since $\tan(x)$ is a component of the function $f$ , then the domain of $f$ $\mathbb D_f= [-2\pi,2\pi]\setminus \mathbb S$ , for if $tan(x)$ is undefined for a specific $x$ so is $\tan[x]\sin^2[2x]$ (for that same $x$ ). The function $f$ is thusly discontinuous. It then follows that the set of ordered pairs in the form $(x,y)$ representing the relation function of $f$ does not contain any element for which the x value is contained in the set $\mathbb S$ .

However, if we also plot $x \in \mathbb S$ we can cognise that 4 of these intersections are ' invalid ', for $f$ is undefined for those $x$ values. $f \cap g \neq 8$ , rather $f \cap g = 4$ So, being explicit on my conclusion, I would state that I believe that: The domain of $\tan(x)$ does not include any element of $\mathbb S=\lbrace\frac{-3\pi}{2},\frac{-\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{3\pi}{2}\rbrace$ Then (for the set of ordered pairs $f$ ) $f \not \ni (x,0) \forall x \in \mathbb S$ i.e. $f \not \supset \lbrace(\frac{-3\pi}{2},0), (\frac{-\pi}{2},0), (\frac{\pi}{2},0), (\frac{3\pi}{2},0)\rbrace$ Then $\mathbb D_f = [-2\pi,2\pi] \setminus \mathbb S \neq [-2\pi,2\pi] = \mathbb D_g = \mathbb D_{\cos x}$ To which ultimately follows that $f(x) \neq g(x) \forall x \in \mathbb S$ Then $ \lvert f \cap g \rvert = 4 \neq 8$ . -end of my argument- I presented this idea to a [presumed] mathematician, to which they replied as follows: I understand why you have said what you have done. Allow me to suggest another way of thinking. If we replace $\tan$ with $\frac{\sin}{\cos}$ , then multiply both sides by $cos$ , we end up with $\sin(x)\sin^2(2x)=\cos^2(x)$ , which is fully defined at all values of $x$ , and has $8$ possible solutions. The $tan$ function is undefined at certain values of $x$ , in that the value of $\tan$ tends to infinity. However, when we multiply anything (including infinity) by zero, we do always obtain zero. While I am not entirely comfortable with algebra including 'infinities' ( cfr. ""multiply infinity by zero""), I think I understand where they wanted to go. I however would insist that even though mathematically and by definition (if I recall correctly) I agree that $\tan(x)\sin^2(2x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}\sin^2(2x)$ I cannot find myself able to agree to the underlying implied proposition that $f(x)=\frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}\sin^2(2x) \forall x \in [-2\pi,2\pi]$ . Which is, to my mind, strictly important to the nature of the problem at hand. In my mind, that manipulation of the function is a form of removing the discontinuity of $f$ , but it (in my mind) is a process whereby the nature of the function is altered and does not remain strictly 'equal' under the proper definition of 'equality' in terms of functions. It is then that my question about the nature of discontinuities and equalities is: If $$\tan(x)=\frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}$$ does it logically follow that $$f(\frac{(2n-1)\pi}{2})=0$$ (which, I want to emphasize, is not the same statement as $\sin^2(2[\frac{(2n-1)\pi}{2}])=0$ ) ??? // I am a high-school student, so I proffer my sincere apologies if any of the \above notation is inappropriate or if the terminology is not on point.","I was recently somewhat confused by the result of an exercise from a textbook that read: Question How many solutions are there to the equation , ?

After some research, asking a teacher, and briefly consulting a tutor from the textbook's company, I am still in doubt concerning where my approach is flawed.

At any rate, I am humbly lost and it would be very gracious from any of you to help, I would really appreciate it. So here we go: Relevant ideas and concepts considered under my approach Equality of functions To my knowledge, in order for two functions to be defined as equal (and thus be mathematically the same, even if represented differently) their domains must be formally equal to each other.

I'm a programmer, but Stackoverflow doesn't like math things, so I came here. How does it look like: We have 5 'chances' for 1 goal, 2 goals, 3, 4, and 5 goals. Each 'chance' has to be lower from previous (chance for 2 goals < chance for 1 goal in a match). And we need to fit in 100% with all 5 values. First, I ask my user to provide a chance for 'one goal'. I did some calculations and it seems, that the 'one goal' chance has to be in a range 22-90, because: if we get 21, our next value must be lower so: 20, 19, 18, 17 which gives: 21+20+19+18+17 = 95 which is not 100% (we need 100% for all goals) So we need to start from 18 and end on 22, cause these are first numbers which sum gives 100. Same situation is for end of the range. It must be maximum 90. If we pick 90 for first goal, we can only pick 4, 3, 2, 1, cause it will give 100. If we would pick 91, we go out of range (100).

I'm a programmer, but Stackoverflow doesn't like math things, so I came here. How does it look like: We have 5 'chances' for 1 goal, 2 goals, 3, 4, and 5 goals. Each 'chance' has to be lower from previous (chance for 2 goals < chance for 1 goal in a match). And we need to fit in 100% with all 5 values. First, I ask my user to provide a chance for 'one goal'. I did some calculations and it seems, that the 'one goal' chance has to be in a range 22-90, because: if we get 21, our next value must be lower so: 20, 19, 18, 17 which gives: 21+20+19+18+17 = 95 which is not 100% (we need 100% for all goals) So we need to start from 18 and end on 22, cause these are first numbers which sum gives 100. Same situation is for end of the range. It must be maximum 90. If we pick 90 for first goal, we can only pick 4, 3, 2, 1, cause it will give 100. If we would pick 91, we go out of range (100). I don't know how to write a function which will change these 'max' and 'min' values while providing next 'chance'.

96,Prove a finite limit based on a given infinite limit,Prove a finite limit based on a given infinite limit,,"Let $f:\mathbb{R}\mapsto \mathbb{R}$ be a function such that $$\lim_\limits{x\to 3}{\frac{f(x)+1}{f(x)-1}}=+\infty$$ with $f(x)\neq 1$ close to $x_0=3$. Prove that: a) $\lim_\limits{x\to 3}{f(x)}=1$ (also prove the limit's existence) b) $f(x)>1$ close to $x_0=3$ I have seen that for the initial given limit to be positive infinity the denominator should be 0 so the limit of f(x) be 1, but I cannot formally express such an argument since the fraction could also be indefinite of the form $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$. For b, if we prove a, in order for the given limit to be positive infinity and not negative, we need the denominator to be positive near/close to $x_0=3$. Any hint?","Let $f:\mathbb{R}\mapsto \mathbb{R}$ be a function such that $$\lim_\limits{x\to 3}{\frac{f(x)+1}{f(x)-1}}=+\infty$$ with $f(x)\neq 1$ close to $x_0=3$.

97,Need help to understand Uniqueness of Lifts theorem's proof.,Need help to understand Uniqueness of Lifts theorem's proof.,,"Theorem: Let $p:E \to B$ be a covering map. Fix $b_0 \in B$ and $e_0 \in p^{-1}(b_0)$. Let $f: X \to B$ be a continuous map with $f(x_0)=b_0$ and $X$ is connected. Suppose $g_1,g_2: X \to E$ are two continuous maps such that $p \circ g_1= p \circ g_2 = f$ and $g_1(x_0)=g_2(x_0)=e_0$, Then $g_1=g_2$. For proving this theorem, my teacher first considered a set $S=\{x \in X |g_1(x)=g_2(x)\}$. The theme of proof was showing $S$ to be both open and closed in $X$ and then using connectedness of $X$ to show that $S=X$. Now, the part of proof I am not able to understand is proving that $S$ is open. It is as follows: Fix $x_1 \in X$ arbitrarily. Let $V_{f(x_1)}$ be any evenly covered neighbourhood of $f(x_1)$. Since $f$ is continuous, there exists a neighbourhood $W_1$ of $x_1$ such that $f(W_1) \subseteq V_{f(x_1)}$.   Put $e_1=g_1(x_1)=g_2(x_1) \in E$. Let $U$ be the slice over $V_{f(x_1)}$ containing $e_1$.   Since $g_1,g_2$ are continuous, there exist open neighbourhoods $W_2,W_3$ of $x_1$ in $X$ such that $g_1(W_2) \subseteq U$ & $g_2(W_3) \subseteq U$.   Let $W_0=W_1 \cap W_2 \cap W_3$.   Now, since $p \circ g_1 = p \circ g_2 = f$, therefore $f(x)=p(g_1(x))=p(g_2(x)) \forall x \in W_0$ where $g_1(x),g_2(x) \in U \forall x \in W_0$.   But $p|U: U \to V_{f(x_1)}$ is a bijection $\Rightarrow g_1(x)=g_2(x) \forall x \in W_0$. Hence $W_0 \subseteq S \Rightarrow S$ is open. Last line of the proof i.e. getting $S$ to be open is clear to me. But how we get $g_1(x)=g_2(x) \forall x \in W_0$is not clear to me.","Theorem: Let $p:E \to B$ be a covering map.

99,Does a tangent exist at $x=0$ to $y=sgn(x)$?,Does a tangent exist at  to ?,x=0 y=sgn(x),"Yesterday my professor told me that a tangent can be constructed at $x=0$ to the signum function reasoning that the two points considered while drawing a tangent must be close horizontally and not necessarily vertically. He also told me that existence of tangent(s) isn't sufficient to prove that a derivative exists, i.e. a tangent can be drawn even when there exists no derivative. Can anyone elaborate this point? Also, regarding the first statement, will this: $x=sgn(y)$ have a tangent at $x=0$? In this case, the two points now are close vertically and not horizontally...
