24,"Covariant derivative of a $(1,1)$ tensor field",Covariant derivative of a  tensor field,"(1,1)","I am trying to understand covariant derivatives in GR. So far, I understand that if $Z$ is a vector field, $\nabla Z$ is a $(1,1)$ tensor field, i.e. the map $\eta,X \mapsto \eta(\nabla_XZ)$ is linear in $\eta$ and $X$ . The map $Z\mapsto\nabla_XZ$ is not a tensor field since, by the Leibniz rule, it is not linear in $Z$ : $$\nabla_X(fZ)=(\nabla_Xf)Z+f(\nabla_XZ)$$ where $\nabla_Xf:=X(f)$ . My lecture notes then state that the action of $\nabla$ is extended to general $(r,s)$ tensor fields by the Leibniz rule, giving an $(r,s+1)$ tensor field as a result. The example given is $\nabla \eta$ , with $\eta$ a $(0,1)$ tensor field: $$(\nabla\eta)(X,Y)\equiv\nabla_X\eta(Y):=\nabla_X(\eta(Y))-\eta(\nabla_XY)$$ which is easily seen to be linear in $X$ , while the first terms from the Leibniz rule cancel to give linearity in $Y$ as well, so this is a $(0,2)$ tensor. They then suggest to try and define $\nabla T$ for $T$ a $(1,1)$ tensor. My attempt at this is: $$\nabla_XT(\eta,Y):=\nabla_X(T(\eta,Y))+T(\nabla_X\eta,Y)-T(\eta,\nabla_XY)$$ Again, linearity in $X$ is easy and the Leibniz rule gives linearity in $Y$ . However, this doesn't seem to be linear in $\eta$ . First, I find that: $$\begin{eqnarray}  \nabla_X(f\eta+\omega) (Y)&=& \nabla_X((f\eta+\omega)(Y)) - (f\eta+\omega)(\nabla_XY)\\ &=& (\nabla_Xf)\eta(Y)+f\nabla_X(\eta(Y))+\nabla_X(\omega(Y))-f\eta(\nabla_XY)-\omega(\nabla_XY)\\ &=& (\nabla_Xf)\eta(Y) + f \nabla_X\eta(Y)+\nabla_X\omega(Y) \end{eqnarray}$$ hence $\nabla_X(f\eta+\omega) = (\nabla_Xf)\eta + f \nabla_X\eta+\nabla_X\omega$ . Therefore: $$\begin{eqnarray}  \nabla_XT(f\eta+\omega,Y)&=& \nabla_X(T(f\eta+\omega,Y))+T(\nabla_X(f\eta+\omega),Y)-T(f\eta+\omega,\nabla_XY)\\ &=& (\nabla_Xf)(T(\eta,Y))+f\nabla_X(T(\eta,Y))+\nabla_X(T(\omega,Y))+(\nabla_Xf)T(\eta,Y)\\&&+fT(\nabla_X\eta,Y)+T(\nabla_X\omega,Y)-fT(\eta,\nabla_XY)-T(\omega,\nabla_XY)\\ &=& 2(\nabla_Xf)(T(\eta,Y)) + f\nabla_XT(\eta,Y)+\nabla_XT(\omega,Y) \end{eqnarray}$$ where the term $2(\nabla_Xf)(T(\eta,Y))$ shows that $\nabla_XT(\eta,Y)$ is not linear in $\eta$ . However, if I defined it as: $$\nabla_XT(\eta,Y):=\nabla_X(T(\eta,Y))-T(\nabla_X\eta,Y)+T(\eta,\nabla_XY)$$ instead, then the same calculation shows that this is linear in $\eta$ , but no longer linear in $Y$ . So I am not sure which, if either, of them is the correct definition. UPDATE: Thanks to Michael Albanese's answer I now understand that the correct definition is $$\nabla_XT(\eta,Y):=\nabla_X(T(\eta,Y))-T(\nabla_X\eta,Y)-T(\eta,\nabla_XY)$$ which is indeed linear in $\eta$ , $X$ and $Y$ . For the benefit of others, I'll mention that my confusion arose because I was trying to reverse engineer the $+$ and $-$ signs from the coordinate basis formula: $$\begin{eqnarray}  T^{{\mu_1}\ldots{\mu_r}}_{\phantom{{\mu_1}\ldots{\mu_r}}{\nu_1}\ldots{\nu_s};\rho} =T^{{\mu_1}\ldots{\mu_r}}_{\phantom{{\mu_1}\ldots{\mu_r}}{\nu_1}\ldots{\nu_s},\rho}&+\Gamma^{\mu_1}_{\sigma\rho}T^{{\sigma}\ldots{\mu_r}}_{\phantom{{\mu_1}\ldots{\mu_r}}{\nu_1}\ldots{\nu_s}}+\ldots+\Gamma^{\mu_r}_{\sigma\rho}T^{{\mu_1}\ldots{\sigma}}_{\phantom{{\mu_1}\ldots{\mu_r}}{\nu_1}\ldots{\nu_s}}\\ &-\Gamma^{\sigma}_{\nu_1\rho}T^{{\mu_1}\ldots{\mu_r}}_{\phantom{{\mu_1}\ldots{\mu_r}}{\sigma}\ldots{\nu_s}}-\ldots-\Gamma^{\sigma}_{\nu_s\rho}T^{{\mu_1}\ldots{\mu_r}}_{\phantom{{\mu_1}\ldots{\mu_r}}{\nu_1}\ldots{\sigma}} \end{eqnarray}$$ But I now see how they follow from the correct definition. In the case of a $(1,1)$ tensor we have $T^{\mu}_{\phantom{\mu}\nu\,;\rho}:=\nabla_{e_\rho}T(f^\mu,e_\nu)$ , where I am using $f^\mu$ and $e_\nu$ for $\mathrm{d}x^\mu$ and $\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\nu}$ . Hence we have: $$\begin{eqnarray}  \nabla_{e_\rho}T(f^\mu,e_\nu) :=& \nabla_{e_\rho}(T(f^\mu,e_\nu))-T(\nabla_{e_\rho}f^\mu,e_\nu)-T(f^\mu,\nabla_{e_\rho}e_\nu) \end{eqnarray}$$ The first and third terms are easily evaluated: $$\nabla_{e_\rho}(T(f^\mu,e_\nu))=e_\rho(T(f^\mu,e_\nu))=e_\rho(T^{\mu}_{\phantom{\mu}\nu})=T^{\mu}_{\phantom{\mu}\nu,\rho}$$ $$T(f^\mu,\nabla_{e_\rho}e_\nu)=T(f^\mu,\Gamma^{\sigma}_{\nu\rho}e_\sigma)=\Gamma^{\sigma}_{\nu\rho}T(f^\mu,e_\sigma)=\Gamma^{\sigma}_{\nu\rho}T^\mu_{\phantom{\mu}\sigma}$$ For the second term, since $f^\mu$ is a $(0,1)$ tensor field, $\nabla f^\mu$ is a $(0,2)$ tensor field and hence $\nabla_{e_\rho}f^\mu$ , for fixed $e_\rho$ , is a $(0,1)$ tensor field. We evaluate: $$\begin{eqnarray}  (\nabla_{e_\rho} f^\mu)_\lambda=\nabla_{e_\rho}f^\mu(e_\lambda) &:= &\nabla_{e_\rho}(f^\mu(e_\lambda))-f^\mu(\nabla_{e_\rho}e_\lambda)  \\ &= & e_\rho(\delta^\mu_\lambda)-f^\mu(\Gamma_{\lambda\rho}^\sigma e_\sigma)\\ &= & 0 -\Gamma_{\lambda\rho}^\sigma f^\mu( e_\sigma)\\ &= & - \Gamma_{\lambda\rho}^\sigma \delta^\mu_\sigma\\ &= & - \Gamma_{\lambda\rho}^\mu \\ &= & - \Gamma_{\sigma\rho}^\mu \delta^\sigma_\lambda\\ &= &  -\Gamma_{\sigma\rho}^\mu f^\sigma( e_\lambda)\\ \end{eqnarray}$$ Therefore $\nabla_{e_\rho}f^\mu =  -\Gamma_{\sigma\rho}^\mu f^\sigma$ and hence: $$T(\nabla_{e_\rho}f^\mu,e_\nu)=T(-\Gamma_{\sigma\rho}^\mu f^\sigma,e_\nu)=-\Gamma_{\sigma\rho}^\mu T(f^\sigma,e_\nu)=-\Gamma_{\sigma\rho}^\mu T^\sigma_{\phantom{\sigma}\nu}$$ Thus, we have: $$\nabla_\rho T^{\mu}_{\phantom{\mu}\nu}=T^{\mu}_{\phantom{\mu}\nu,\rho}+\Gamma_{\sigma\rho}^\mu T^\sigma_{\phantom{\sigma}\nu}-\Gamma^{\sigma}_{\nu\rho}T^\mu_{\phantom{\mu}\sigma}$$ as expected.","I am trying to understand covariant derivatives in GR.

Because of this $|X_1| = \sqrt{|g(X_1,X_1)|}$ is a non-vanishing smooth vector field on $U_1$, then we can normalize $X_1$, by setting  $$ E_1 =  \frac{X_1}{|X_1|}. $$ Similarly, the vector $V_2 = X_2 - \varepsilon_1 g(X_2,E_1)E_1$ is a smooth vector field with  $g(V_2,V_2)(p) = g_p(V_2|_p,V_2|_p) = g_p(v_2,v_2) = \pm 1$.

79,Is an injective morphism from a Lie group to itself surjective?,Is an injective morphism from a Lie group to itself surjective?,,"I have a question about Lie groups. Let $G$ be a finite dimensional (real or complex) Lie group and $f:G \rightarrow G$ an homomorphism of Lie groups. Edit : in the view of some counter-examples let's also suppose $G$ connected. Q1 : Suppose that $f$ is injective, is it then surjective ? Here are my attempts so far to adress this question. It is known that an injective Lie homomorphism is an immersion so the differential $df_g$ of $f$ in any point $g\in G$ is injective. For reasons of dimension, $df_g$ is then bijective. Thus, by the inversion theorem, $f$ is a diffeormorphism from $G$ to $f(G)\leq G$. Moreover, it is also well known that $f(G) \simeq G/Ker(f) \simeq G/\lbrace e \rbrace \simeq G$. So we have a subgroup $f(G)$ of $G$ isomorphic to $G$. Then, we can reduce the question to : Q2 : Let $H$ be a Lie subgroup of $G$. If $H \simeq G$, do we have $H=G$ ? Now, maybe we can progress with some topological argument. Typically, I think of the fundamental group, that is useful to link the classification of Lie groups to the classification of Lie algebras. As $H$ is diffeomorphic to $G$, we have $\pi(H)=\pi(G)$. Hence a third question : Q3 : Let $H$ be a Lie subgroup of $G$. If $Lie(H)=Lie(G)$ and $\pi(H)=\pi(G)$, do we have $H=G$ ? After that, I have to admit that I don't have ideas about where to look. So if someone as an answer, a hint or a reference, that would be awesome. In addition, I have a few ""bonus"" questions around this subject : B1 : If the answer to the questions above is no, what is a counterexample ? Is there a simple hypothesis we can add so that it becomes true ? B2 : What are the possible generalisations to all this discussion ? For example with infinite dimensional Lie groups ?

Let $C$ denote the Lie algebra of the conformal vector fields on $M$. It is known that $\dim(C) \le \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$. Robert Bryant said here that this can be proven using local calculations and the Frobenius theorem. I don't see how to implement this approach. Any ideas? (Or other elementary arguments?) I know that a vector field $V$ is conformal if and only if $$ \nabla V+(\nabla V)^T=\frac{2}{n} \text{tr}(\nabla V)\text{Id}_{TM}= \frac{2}{n} \text{div} V \cdot  \text{Id}_{TM}.$$ In the case of Killing fields the situation is easier:  $\nabla V$ is skew-symmetric, and $V$ is determined by $V|_p,\nabla V|_p $, so the dimension of the Killing algebra is not greater than $n+\frac{n(n-1)}{2}=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. In the conformal case, it is not true that a conformal field is determined by its value and its covariant derivative at a point. (This time the space of possible $\nabla V|_p$ is of dimension $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}+1$). Also, in the conformal case we really need to use somewhere that $n \ge 3$, since for $n=2$ it can be infinite-dimensional.","Let $M$ be a smooth $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold, $n \ge 3$.
