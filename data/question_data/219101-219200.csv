0,Why is the Fourier transform of $\tan(t)$ not $\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}} \csc(\frac{\pi \omega}{2})$,Why is the Fourier transform of  not,\tan(t) \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}} \csc(\frac{\pi \omega}{2}),"$\DeclareMathOperator{\sech}{sech}$ $\DeclareMathOperator{\csch}{csch}$ I was curious why Wolfram Alpha does not give a Fourier transform for $\tan(t)$ when it does provide one for $\tanh(t)$ . According to Wolfram Alpha $\mathcal{F}[\tanh(t)] = i\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}} \csch(\frac{\pi \omega}{2}) $ . This is all well and good, however using the fact that $\mathcal{F}[g(a t)] = \frac{1}{|a|}\hat{g}(\frac{t}{a})$ , we could easily show that $\mathcal{F}[\tanh(t)] = \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}} \csc(\frac{\pi \omega}{2})$ . Note that, $-i \tanh(i t) = \tan(t)$ and $i \csch(i \omega) =\csc(\omega)$ . Therefore, setting $a = i$ the following formula holds. $-i\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2 |a|}} \csch(\frac{\pi \omega}{2 a}) =-i\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2|i|}} \csch(\frac{\pi \omega}{2 i}) =-\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}\csc( \frac{-\pi \omega}{2}) = \csc(\frac{\pi \omega}{2}) $ This question implies that this sort of manipulation is allowed. Have I voilated some underlying integrability assumption where this is not a valid operation? Or does Wolfram Alpha have some oversight. As context I was working a derivation of the fact $\sech(\pi t)$ is its own Fourier transform, and the method works for $\tan(t)$ as well. I was a bit surprised that Wolfram Alpha does not have $\tan(t)$ , leading me to question my method.","I was curious why Wolfram Alpha does not give a Fourier transform for when it does provide one for .

At the moment, the only approach I could think of uses calculus and works as follows: The derivative of $\cos_2$ can be written as: $\cos_2 '(\theta)=-\sin(\alpha - \theta)\cdot(-1)=\sin(\alpha - \theta)$ and the derivative of $\cos_1$ can be written as $-\sin(\theta)$ .

Further, it is also apparent that $\cos_1(\theta) = \cos_2(\theta)$ when $\theta = \frac{\alpha}{2}$ .

Briefly, the proof works by contradiction. Suppose there is a $y \in I$ where $y \neq x^*$ such that $f(y)=g(y)$ . Either $y \lt x^*$ or $y \gt x^*$ . Suppose the former. By assumption: If $y \lt x^*$ , then $f(y) \gt f(x^*)$ and $g(y) \lt g(x^*)$ ...because $f$ is strictly decreasing and $g$ is strictly increasing. However, $g(y)=f(y) \gt f(x^*)=g(x^*)$ .

Klein's book ""Lectures on the Icosahedron and the Solution of Equations of the Fifth Degree"" and in Part 1, Chapter 2, we desire to deduce a general formula for an arbitrary rotation of sphere. The idea is as follows: first we use stereographic projection to identify $S^2 = \{(\xi,\eta,\zeta)\in \mathbb{R}^3| \quad  \xi^2+\eta^2+\zeta^2=1\}$ with Riemann sphere $\mathbb{C} \cup \{\infty\}$ via the following formula: $z = x + i y = \frac{\xi+i\eta}{1-\zeta}$ . If we further identify $\mathbb{C}\cup \{\infty\}$ with $\mathbb{CP}^1$ , we can conclude every rotation will be represented by a fractional linear substitution. Now, given a rotation which fixes antipodal points $(\xi,\eta,\zeta), (-\xi,-\eta,-\zeta)$ , which correspondences to $\frac{\xi+i\eta}{1-\zeta}, -\frac{\xi+i\eta}{1+\zeta}$ in $\mathbb{C}\cup \{\infty\}$ and rotate through an angle $\alpha$ counterclockwise. Above process can be decomposed into two steps: first we move $-\frac{\xi+i\eta}{1+\zeta}$ to $0$ and move $\frac{\xi+i\eta}{1-\zeta}$ to $\infty$ , which corresponds to the following fractional linear substitution up to some constant: $$ C\cdot \frac{z+\frac{\xi+i\eta}{1+\zeta}}{z -\frac{\xi+i\eta}{1-\zeta} } $$ Then we get our new $0,\infty$ axis and then we rotate our $(\xi',\eta')$ -plane (equatorial plane) by an angle $\alpha$ counterclockwise, which correspond to multipyling factor $e^{i\alpha}$ . Suppose $z'$ is the coordinate after the rotation, we must have: $$ \frac{z'+\frac{\xi+i\eta}{1+\zeta}}{z' -\frac{\xi+i\eta}{1-\zeta} } = e^{i\alpha}\frac{z+\frac{\xi+i\eta}{1+\zeta}}{z -\frac{\xi+i\eta}{1-\zeta} } \quad(*) $$ The author claimed that if we do the following change of notation: $$ \xi \sin(\frac{\alpha}{2})=a, \quad \eta \sin(\frac{\alpha}{2})=b, \quad \zeta\sin(\frac{\alpha}{2})=c, \quad \cos(\frac{\alpha}{2})=d, $$ Then $(*)$ can be rewritten as $$ z' = \frac{(d+ic)z-(b-ia)}{(b+ia)z+(d-ic)} \quad (**) $$ That is where I stuck.

58,Tate conjecture for Fermat varieties,Tate conjecture for Fermat varieties,,"I've been looking at Tate's Algebraic Cycles and Poles of Zeta Functions (hard to find online... Google books outline here ) and have a question about his work on (conjecturing!) the Tate conjecture for the Fermat variety $X_m^r$, defined by the equation $$ X_0^m + X_1^m + \cdots + X_r^m = 0$$ over a field $\mathbb{F}_q$ of characteristic $p$. Fix some $i$, $0\leq i\leq m$. He starts by saying there is only one non-trivial dimension to consider, namely $r = 2i+1$. This is because, combining the Veronese embedding with the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, we have that every non-middle cohomology is 0 or 1-dimensional, and so the cycle class map is surjective (i.e., the Tate conjecture holds) trivially. Now, if some power of $p$ is congruent to -1 modulo $m$, then because the map $X_m^r \to X_{q+1}^r$ given by $X_j \to X_j^{(q+1)/m}$ is dominant, we can (without loss of generality) assume $m = q+1$. The benefit to doing this is because we now have a large group of automorphisms: the maps induced by the maps in the group $U$ of projective transformations $$ X_j \to \sum a_{ij}X_i $$ where $(a_{ij})$ is a matrix over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ which is unitary with respect to the map $a\to a^q$. Now he writes that he and John Thompson proved the representation of $U$ on $H^{2i}(\overline{X})$ (where $\overline{X} = X\times_{\mathbb{F}_q} \overline{\mathbb{F}_q}$) decomposes as (the direct sum of) the trivial representation and an irreducible representation, and the desired result follows easily from this. There is a natural action, applying the automorphisms of $U$ to $\overline{X}$, but I'm not entirely sure how to get a hold of $U$. I'm guessing once I have an idea of how to get my hands on the representation, the rest should follow without too much trouble. Edit: Some potential progress! We can decompose the representation of $U$ on $H^{2i}(\overline{X})$ without actually computing it (though I'd still like to hear about how!). Indeed, the action of $U$ on $H^{2i}(\overline{X})$ is transitive, so there are only two conjugacy classes and hence the representation decomposes as the trivial representation and a non-trivial (irreducible) representation. From here, we may find the eigenvalues of the $q^2$ Frobenius. From the Weil conjectures, we know they are of the form $\zeta q^w$ for some $\zeta$ with aboslute value 1, and integer $w$. Further, Weil computed the Zeta function of the Fermat variety $X_m^r$ (see Number of Solutions of Equations in Finite Fields ), and showed the eigenvalues are all Jacobi sums, and combined with the Weil conjectures, we can find (since the characters are nice) that each of these must be $\pm q^i$ (recall, we only need to consider the middle cohomology). Thus, the classes of the (appropriately twisted) middle cohomology are all algebraic, i.e., if there are ""enough"" cycles, every class in the appropriate cohomology could be the image of a cycle. On the other hand, to see there are (enough) cycles, one can simply show the cycles don't only map into the trivial part of the representation of $U$. This is done in the answer here . I would still be happy to have input on approaches that work more closely with $U$. Or corrections to the above, if I've missed something.","I've been looking at Tate's Algebraic Cycles and Poles of Zeta Functions (hard to find online...

Fix some $i$, $0\leq i\leq m$. He starts by saying there is only one non-trivial dimension to consider, namely $r = 2i+1$. This is because, combining the Veronese embedding with the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, we have that every non-middle cohomology is 0 or 1-dimensional, and so the cycle class map is surjective (i.e., the Tate conjecture holds) trivially. Now, if some power of $p$ is congruent to -1 modulo $m$, then because the map $X_m^r \to X_{q+1}^r$ given by $X_j \to X_j^{(q+1)/m}$ is dominant, we can (without loss of generality) assume $m = q+1$. The benefit to doing this is because we now have a large group of automorphisms: the maps induced by the maps in the group $U$ of projective transformations $$ X_j \to \sum a_{ij}X_i $$ where $(a_{ij})$ is a matrix over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ which is unitary with respect to the map $a\to a^q$. Now he writes that he and John Thompson proved the representation of $U$ on $H^{2i}(\overline{X})$ (where $\overline{X} = X\times_{\mathbb{F}_q} \overline{\mathbb{F}_q}$) decomposes as (the direct sum of) the trivial representation and an irreducible representation, and the desired result follows easily from this. There is a natural action, applying the automorphisms of $U$ to $\overline{X}$, but I'm not entirely sure how to get a hold of $U$. I'm guessing once I have an idea of how to get my hands on the representation, the rest should follow without too much trouble. Edit: Some potential progress! We can decompose the representation of $U$ on $H^{2i}(\overline{X})$ without actually computing it (though I'd still like to hear about how!). Indeed, the action of $U$ on $H^{2i}(\overline{X})$ is transitive, so there are only two conjugacy classes and hence the representation decomposes as the trivial representation and a non-trivial (irreducible) representation. From here, we may find the eigenvalues of the $q^2$ Frobenius. From the Weil conjectures, we know they are of the form $\zeta q^w$ for some $\zeta$ with aboslute value 1, and integer $w$. Further, Weil computed the Zeta function of the Fermat variety $X_m^r$ (see Number of Solutions of Equations in Finite Fields ), and showed the eigenvalues are all Jacobi sums, and combined with the Weil conjectures, we can find (since the characters are nice) that each of these must be $\pm q^i$ (recall, we only need to consider the middle cohomology). Thus, the classes of the (appropriately twisted) middle cohomology are all algebraic, i.e., if there are ""enough"" cycles, every class in the appropriate cohomology could be the image of a cycle. On the other hand, to see there are (enough) cycles, one can simply show the cycles don't only map into the trivial part of the representation of $U$. This is done in the answer here . I would still be happy to have input on approaches that work more closely with $U$.

I have some clues about the geometrical interpretation of the Riemann-Roch Theorem for smooth algebraic curves, but also some doubts which I would like to clarify. Recall that the RR formula is $$ h^0(X,\,D)-h^0(X,\,K-D) = d-g+1\,. $$ Assume that $X$ is not hyperelliptic, so that the canonical map is actually a canonical embedding $$ \phi_K : X \to \mathbb{P}^{g-1} \qquad P\mapsto\{ \; s\in H^0(X,\,K) \mid s(P)=0 \; \} $$ giving a preferred realization of the curve inside a $(g-1)$-dimensional projective space. The key feature of such an embedding is that there is a bijective correspondence between hyperplanes $W\subset \mathbb{P}^{g-1}$ and effective divisors in the linear system $ |K| \cong \mathbb{P}H^0(X,\,K) $. The picture shows the canonical embedding in $\mathbb{P}^2$ of a non hyperelliptic curve of genus $3$. Let $D=\sum_{i=1}^d P_i$ be an effective divisor consisting of $d<g$ distinct points of $X$.

If so, how can one see it formally? Let $r(D) := \dim |D|$ denote the dimension of the complete linear series associated to $D$. Further, denote by $D'=K-D$ the residual divisor of degree $d'=2g-2-d$. If (1) is correct, then it follows that $r(D)$ equals the number of hyperplanes of $\mathbb{P}^{g-1}$ passing through $\phi_K(D')$. Now, notice that the RR can be rewritten as $$ r(D)=[g-1]-[d' - r(D')] $$ so that we deduce that $r(D')$ counts the number of independent linear relations on the points of $D'$ and we can give the following geometrical interpretation of the Riemann-Roch: The integer $r(D)$ is the number of hyperplanes passing though $\phi_K(D')$, hence it equals the difference between the dimension $g-1$ of the ambient space and the dimension of the space spanned by the points of $\phi_K(D')$.

A map $f:X\to Y$ is called a morphism of $k$-varieties if $f$ is continuous, and if for every open subvariety $U$ of $Y$ and every regular function $f:U\to k$ the composition $h\circ f$ is a regular function on $f^{-1}(U)$. I have trouble seeing the motivation for this definition. The above notion of morphism seems to imply that the 'structure' of a variety (what distinguishes it from a mere set) is the following: A topology, the Zariski topology, which is extremely coarse (weak) compared to the Euclidean topology in the case $k=\mathbb{C}$. For every Zariski-open $U\subseteq X$ a specification of which functions $U\to k$ are considered 'nice', i.e. regular. Given that this is indeed the structure we want to assign to a variety, I agree with the above notion of morphism. In particular, I can see that two varieties are isomorphic exactly when their structure is 'the same' (so that the difference between them is just that their points have different names). However, I fail to see why the above two bullets accurately capture what we want them to. In fact, I do not know when we want to consider two varieties as isomorphic, and why. I do not know why we want the curves defined by $x^2+y^2=1$ and $x^2+y^2=2$ to be deemed isomorphic, but not the affine plane and the punctured affine plane (except for just pointing back to the definition I am trying to motivate, and showing that no isomorphism exists algebraically, but that's not enlightening). I do know this in the category of smooth manifolds: I expect two spheres to be diffeomorphic because I can stretch one smoothly to exactly match the other. I expect a sphere and a torus not to be diffeomorphic because no matter how hard I try, I cannot strech the sphere and make it coincide with a torus. Another example: the affine line and the cusp are not isomorphic, and the difference lies exactly in the singularity of the cusp (its... well, cusp). Is this what we want to encode, the behaviour of varieties near singularities (I suspect this is only part of what we want to encode)? Do we want two varieties to be isomorphic if there is a bicontinuous bijection between them that maps singularities to singularities of the same kind? (Here, I do not know what I mean by the 'kind' of a singularity, and in fact I don't even know what exactly I mean by a singularity.) I expect that isomorphic varieties will have 'analogous' singularities at corresponding points, but I suppose there is more to the structure of a variety than this (indeed, not all smooth varieties are isomorphic). What do we want the structure of a variety to entail intuitively? What intuitive/geometric information is encoded in the 'structure' as outlined in the bullets above? Edit. I want to know what is encoded in the structure of a variety on a vague and intuitive level. I do not require mathematical justification for the answers at all (no need to prove that this is what we encode).","I am reading course notes on algebraic geometry, where a morphism of varieties is defined as follows ($k$ is an algebraically closed field): Let $X$ be a quasi-affine or quasi-projective $k$-variety, and let $Y$ be a quasi-affine or quasi-projective $k$-variety.
