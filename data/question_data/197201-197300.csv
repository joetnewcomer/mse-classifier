0,When Does an Atlas Uniquely Define a Manifold?,When Does an Atlas Uniquely Define a Manifold?,,"I am totally new to differential geometry and am having trouble understanding a very basic idea. In what follows, I apologize for being gratuitously pedantic, but I want to be sure I clearly understand what's going on. If $M$ is a set and $T$ is a topology on $M$ such that $(M,T)$ is Hausdorff and second countable, then $M$ is a topological manifold if for all $p\in M$ there exists an ordered pair $(U,x)$ such that $U \subset M$ is $T$ -open and $x:U\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$ is a homeomorphism whose image is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$ in the standard topology. Ordered pairs $(U,x)$ that satisfy the conditions in the above paragraph are called charts on the manifold. An atlas for $M$ is a collection of charts on $M$ , $A = \{(U_a,x_a)\colon a \in I\}$ , such that $\cup_{\alpha\in I}U_a = M$ . Question 1: Does every manifold have at least one atlas? My answer: I believe so, since by the definition of a manifold there exists at least one chart for each point, and the collection of either all or at least one of the charts at each point can be taken as an atlas. Perhaps however there is some technical problem in set theory with this construction. Question 2: Does an atlas uniquely define a manifold? That is, if $A$ and $A'$ are atlases and $A \neq A'$ , is it necessary true that the manifolds with $(X,T)$ as their underlying space but with atlases $A$ and $A'$ respectively are different? (In the naive sense--not considering the possibility that they are diffeomorphic) I believe the core concept I'm struggling with here is what the naive notion of equivalence is for manifolds. (For example, for topological spaces ""naive equivalence"" means that the two underlying sets are equal and the two topologies have exactly the same open sets, rather than the existence of a homeomorphism, which is a more sophisticated notion of equivalence.) If instead we define a topological manifold as an ordered triple $(M,T,A)$ , where $A$ is an atlas, my confusion vanishes. But then naive equivalence requires exactly the same charts in the atlas, which might be too much to reasonably say that two manifolds are the same. I've also not seen this definition in any of the references I'm using. This brings up the following question. Question 3: Is it possible to define a manifold as an ordered triple, as in the paragraph above?","I am totally new to differential geometry and am having trouble understanding a very basic idea.

4,Symplectic but not Hamiltonian Vector Fields,Symplectic but not Hamiltonian Vector Fields,,"In symplectic geometry, given a manifold $M$ with closed nondegenerate symplectic 2-form $\omega$ , it is known that a vector field $X$ is Hamiltonian if $$\iota_X\omega=dH$$ for some smooth function $H\in C^\infty(M)$ . A vector field is symplectic if it preserves the symplectic structure along the flow, i.e. $$\mathcal L_X\omega=0\,.$$ One of the easiest ways to check them is to note that if $X$ is symplectic then $\iota_X\omega$ is closed, and if $X$ is Hamiltonian then $\iota_X\omega$ is exact. Consequently, all Hamiltonian vector fields are symplectic but the converse is not true. Locally, however, Poincare lemma guarantees that every symplectic vector field is Hamiltonian. Now consider symplectic 2-torus $(\mathbb T^2,d\theta\wedge d\phi)$ and a vector field $$X=\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\,.$$ Using the first de Rham cohomology, one usually concludes that $X$ is not Hamiltonian. However, I am unsure why: note that $\iota_X\omega=d\phi$ , so it looks to me this is exact. Of course, we see that $\phi$ is not globally defined on $\mathbb T^2$ , so perhaps this is not correct. But this argument would seem to imply that for symplectic 2-sphere $(S^2,d\theta\wedge d\phi)$ , $X$ is not Hamiltonian (even though it should be, since it is symplectic and $$H^1_{\text{de Rham}}(S^2)=0\,.$$ Another example: Consider symplectic 2-sphere $(S^2,d\theta\wedge dh$ ), where $H(\theta,h)=h$ is a height function. In this case, the same vector field $X$ is Hamiltonian , since we obtained the required smooth Hamiltonian function $H$ . Now I reverse the problem: consider another 2-torus $(\mathbb T^2,d\theta\wedge dh)$ and the same vector field $X$ . Now it looks like $X$ is Hamiltonian, even though we know $$H^1_{\text{de Rham}}(\mathbb T^2)\neq0\,.$$ From my (naive) understanding, $H^1_{\text{de Rham}}(M)$ should be the only obstruction for a symplectic vector field to be Hamiltonian vector field, and not on the choice of the symplectic 2-form. Question: What has gone wrong here? For the first example, for instance, it may have to do with seeing that $d\phi$ is not exterior derivative of $\phi$ , which I may have misunderstood.","In symplectic geometry, given a manifold with closed nondegenerate symplectic 2-form , it is known that a vector field is Hamiltonian if for some smooth function .

18,Proving diffeomorphism invariance of boundary,Proving diffeomorphism invariance of boundary,,"I'm trying to follow Lee's book Introduction to Smooth Manifold in details. In chapter 2, Exercise 2.19 asks the reader to prove that if $F:M \to N$ is a smooth diffeomorphism between manifolds with boundary, then $F (\partial M) = \partial N$ . It suffices to show that $F(\partial M) \subseteq \partial N$ . I thought about mimicking the proof given in the book that, in a smooth manifold, a point cannot be a boundary point and be in the domain of an interior chart at the same time (Theorem 1.46). However, I noticed that the argument would rely on knowing forehand that the two manifolds have the same dimension, that is to say their charts map to open subsets of the same $\mathbb{H}^n$ , but it is not clear for me at all that I can assume that. For completeness, a sketch of my proof would go like this: Given $p \in \partial M$ , by definition of $F$ smooth there exists $(U, \phi)$ and $(V, \psi)$ charts such that $F(U) \subseteq V$ and $\hat{F} = \psi \circ F \circ \phi^{-1}$ is smooth. Since $p$ is a boundary point, this means there exists an open set $U_x$ containing $x = \phi(p)$ and $F_x: U_x \to \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $F_x = F$ in $\phi (U) \subset \mathbb{H}^m$ (and not necessarily $m = n$ ). Now let us suppose that $F(p) \in \mathrm{int} \, M$ . Then, since $F$ is a diffeomorphism (and thus an open mapping), by restricting if necessary we may suppose that $F(U) = V$ . If $G = F^{-1}: N \to M$ , it is known that $\hat{G} = \phi \circ G \circ \psi^{-1}: \psi (V) \to \phi (U)$ is smooth (in the sense of $\mathbb{R}^n$ , because $F(p)$ is an interior point). Now, we may find a ball $B$ around $\psi (F(p)) = \hat{F} (x)$ such that $\hat{G}(B) \subseteq \phi(U) \cap U_x$ . Thus, we could write $$\mathrm{Id}_B = F_x \circ \hat{G} $$ as a composition of smooth functions in the regular sense (defined on open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbb{R}^m$ , respectively). The conclusion would follow by noticing that pointwise $DF_x \circ D\hat{G} = \mathrm{Id}$ and thus $D \hat{G}$ is non-singular, but this would only be true if $m = n$ - otherwise I can only conclude it has a left-inverse. I wonder if: there's some independent more basic argument that allows me suppose that $m = n$ right from the start; or the actual proof of this fact goes in a completely different direction, and implies somewhere along the way that $m = n$ .

I took a locally finite cover of $M$ by precompact open sets ${\bf U}=\{U_i\}_{i\in I}$. Since $f$ is continuous I know $f$ attains a minimum on each ${\rm cl}(U_i)$, say at $x_i$, and that this minimum is still positive. So I defined maps $g_i: U_i\to\mathbb{R}$ given as a constant maps: $g_i(x)=\epsilon_i$, where $\epsilon_i$ is chosen to be $0<\epsilon_i<f(x_i)$. But each $x\in M$ is contained in only finitely many $U_i$, so I defined $h(x)=\min{\{g_i(x)\;|\; x\in U_i\}}$. Now I take a partition of unity $\{\psi_i:M\to\mathbb{R}\}_{i\in I}$ subordinate to ${\bf U}$. My thinking is to smoothly stitch together these constant maps... but I'm not sure what to do from here. Should I define $g(x)=\sum_{i\in I}{\psi_i(x)\,h(x)}$? I know each of these sums will be finite because $supp(\psi_i)\subseteq U_i$, but does this function actually do what I want it to?

39,Biot-Savart law on a torus?,Biot-Savart law on a torus?,,"Background: In classical electrodynamics, given the shape of a wire carrying electric current, it is possible to obtain the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ via the Biot-savart law . If the wire is a curve $\gamma$ parametrized as $\mathbf{y}(s)$ , where $s$ is the arc-length, then $$ \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x}) = \beta \int_\gamma \dfrac{ d\mathbf{y}\times(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}) }{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}|^3}  = \beta  \int_\gamma ds \dfrac{  \mathbf{y}'(s) \times(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}(s)) }{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}(s)|^3} \, ,  $$ where $\beta $ is just a physical constant proportional to the current in the wire. Another application of the Biot-Savart law is to find the velocity field $\mathbf{v}$ around a bent vortex line in a fluid, in the approximation of incompressible and irrotational fluid flow (i.e. $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} =0$ and $\nabla \times \mathbf{v} =0$ almost everywhere) and very-thin diameter of the vortex core. In fact, by demanding that the vorticity of the fluid is concentrated on the vortex core (i.e. it is distributed as a Dirac delta peaked on the vortex core), $$ \mathbf{w}(\mathbf{x}) = \nabla \times \mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x})=  c \int_\gamma ds \, \mathbf{y}'(s)\, \delta(  \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}(s))   \, , $$ we have that the Helmholtz decomposition and the fact $\delta(\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{x} ) = -\nabla^2 \, (4 \pi |\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{x}|)^{-1}$ tell us that $$  \mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x})=  \frac{c}{4 \pi}  \int_\gamma ds \dfrac{  \mathbf{y}'(s) \times(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}(s)) }{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}(s)|^3}$$ Again, the constant $c$ is just a physical constant that sets the value of the circulation of the field $\mathbf{v}$ around the vortex.

Let $\nabla$ be the associated Levi-Civita connection. Consider a smooth unit-speed curve $\gamma$ on $S$ which parameterizes the boundary of a compact simply connected set with smooth boundary, and denote by $J_{\gamma}$ the unique inward pointing vector field along $\gamma$ such that $\{ \dot{\gamma}, J_\gamma\}$ is an orthonormal frame. Let $D_t$ denote covariant differentiation along $\gamma$ . Since $g(\dot{\gamma}, \dot{\gamma}) = 1$ , compatibility of the Levi-Civita connection shows $g(D_t \dot{\gamma}, \dot{\gamma}) = 0$ . Hence orthonormal expansion shows $D_t \dot{\gamma} = g(D_t \dot{\gamma}, J_\gamma) J_\gamma$ . And so the signed geodesic curvature at a point of the unit-speed curve $\gamma$ is defined to be the value of $g(D_t \dot{\gamma}, J_\gamma)$ at that point, and this expression shows the unsigned geodesic curvature , by definition $|D_t \dot{\gamma}|$ , equals the absolute value of the signed geodesic curvature.

74,Proving Linkedness of Hopf Fibers,Proving Linkedness of Hopf Fibers,,"So I've been working on understanding the Hopf fibration in terms of quaternions for the past few months, following along with the investigations in David Lyon's paper, "" An Elementary Introduction to the Hopf Fibration"" . I've done a good job getting through almost the entirety of the paper, until I get to the last investigation: Investigation (M). The Hopf fibration is a mapping from $S^3 \mapsto S^2$ such that the preimage of a point on $S^2$ is a circle (fiber) in $S^3$ . The previous investigation, which I already did successfully, shows that these fibers, when stereographically projected, are linked with the unit circle in the $yz$ -plane. This is simple enough. Here is investigation (M): To show that any two projected fiber circles $C$ and $D$ are linked, we exhibit a continuous one-to-one map $\psi: \mathbb{R}^3 → \mathbb{R}^3$ that takes $C$ to the unit circle in the $y, z$ -plane, and takes $D$ to some other projected fiber circle $E$ . Since $E$ is linked with the unit circle in the $y, z$ -plane, $C$ and $D$ must also be linked. See Figure 9. (Students who have never studied topology may accept the intuitively reasonable statement that linked-ness of circles cannot be altered by a continuous bijective map. Students with experience in topology may enjoy trying to prove this.) Here is how to construct the map $\psi$ . Let $P$ be any point on the circle $C$ , and let $r = s^{−1}(P)$ . Define $f: \mathbb{R}^4 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^4$ by $f(x) = kr^{−1}x$ (quaternion multiplication). The map $\psi$ is the composition $s \circ f \circ s^{−1}$ . Just for some background: $s$ is the stereographic projection map given by $$(w,x,y,z) \mapsto \left(\frac{x}{1-w}, \frac{y}{1-w}, \frac{z}{1-w} \right)$$ where $(w,x,y,z)$ is the vector in $\mathbb{R}^4$ associated with the quaternion given by the Hopf map. A long investigation previous to this (Investigation (J)) explains that these quaternions are $h^{-1}(P) = \{r_1 e^{it}\}_{0\leq t \leq 2\pi}$ where $P$ is any point on $S^2$ . This is not the same P as the one on the fiber in Investigation M . So this is how I'm thinking about the problem: I understand that if we can construct a continuous map that takes 2 fibers and sends one to the unit circle in the $yz$ -plane, then we have shown that since all fibers are linked with the unit circle, and continuous maps don't break linked-ness, then the fibers must be linked with each other. The part I can't get is actually proving this. Instead of creating a fiber, I just took a specific quaternion corresponding with a particular fiber and defined that as $r = s^{-1}(P)$ . If you apply $s(f(r))$ , you end up with $k$ . Then I picked another point on that fiber and used the same $r^{-1}$ to calculate $f$ , but the algebra ended up really messy and I wasn't getting anywhere. I know what should follow is a unit circle, but I don't think I'm approaching the problem correctly, because it seems overly tedious. Does anyone have any thoughts about how to prove this? Thanks!","So I've been working on understanding the Hopf fibration in terms of quaternions for the past few months, following along with the investigations in David Lyon's paper, "" An Elementary Introduction to the Hopf Fibration"" .

Let $V$ be an $n$-dimensional normed space over the reals and equip $V$ with the topology that its norm induces. $V$ can be given a natural smooth structure, making it into a smooth $n$-manifold. Now, let $\{v_1, \dots, v_n\}$ be an ordered basis for $V$. Any $p \in V$ can be written as $p = c^i v_i$, where we are using Einstein notation. This means that $p$ has the coordinate representation $(c^1, \dots, c^n)$, relative to the given basis. This seems to define a coordinate system - not in the usual differential geometric sense, but if $V = \mathbb{R}^n$ then a basis gives us coordinate axes. However, we also have the usual definition of a coordinate system about $p$: The ordered pair $(U, \varphi)$ is a coordinate system about $p$ if $U \ni p$ and $U$ is open and $\varphi$ is a diffeomorphism onto some open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. This allows us to naturally identify $p$ with $(x^1(p), \dots, x^n(p))$ where the $x^i$ are the local coordinates of $\varphi$. So it seems that the two definitions of coordinate systems above give us the same thing: a way to uniquely identify $p$ with a point of $\mathbb{R}^n$, which is precisely what we want. However, the two definitions are not equivalent. Let me demonstrate: Given that $V$ is a finite-dimensional vector space, I will make the usual identification of $V$ with $T_p V$ and just write $V$ instead. Similarly, even though $p \in V$, it will also be used interchangeably as both an element of $V$ as well as $T_p V$. Given a coordinate system $(U, \varphi)$, it induces a coordinate basis at $p$, and this is like a coordinate system in the first linear algebraic sense that I described. That's fine. In a differential geometric sense, $p$ is identified with $(x^1(p), \dots, x^n(p))$. In a linear algebraic sense, we can write $p = p^i \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}$ where $p^i = p(x^i)$.

Actually, one can adapt the argument of that answer to see that if there is one such point $p$ (that minimizing geodesics from it to all other points are unique), then the manifold will be diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$. Thus, to refute the conjecture , it is enough to find a manifold with one such point which is not diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$.",,"['differential-geometry', 'riemannian-geometry', 'geodesic']"

Theorem 7.35 (Characterization of Semidirect Products). Suppose $G$ is a Lie group, and $N,H\subseteq G$ are closed Lie subgroups such that $N$ is normal, $N\cap H=\{e\}$, and $NH=G$. Then the map $(n,h)\mapsto nh$ is a Lie group isomorphism between $N\rtimes_\theta H$ and $G$, where $\theta:H\times N\to N$ is the action by conjugation: $\theta_h(n)=hnh^{-1}$. The proof is left as an exercise so I cannot verify if I am correct, but I believe that it is unnecessary to assume that $H$ is a closed Lie subgroup. It appears that we only need $H$ to be an immersed Lie subgroup of $G$ (but $N$ still needs to be closed). Am I correct? Here is my proof without assuming that $H$ is closed: Proof. We first show that $\theta$ is smooth. Since $N$ is normal, we have $\theta_h(H\times N)\subseteq N$. Moreover, $N$ is an embedded submanifold of $G$ since it is closed (Theorem 7.21), and $H\times N$ is an immersed submanifold of $G\times G$, so the conjugation map $C:G\times G\to G$, $C(a,b)=aba^{-1}$ restricts to a smooth map $\theta:H\times N\to N$ (Corollaries 5.27 and 5.30). Moreover, for each $h\in H$, $\theta_h:N\to N$ is a Lie group isomorphism, so $\theta$ is an action by automorphisms and hence defines a semi-direct product $N\rtimes_\theta H$. Now, the map $$F:N\rtimes_\theta H\to G,\quad F(n,h)=nh$$ is smooth since it is the restriction of the multiplication map $m:G\times G\to G$ to the immersed submanifold $N\times H$ of $G\times G$. Moreover, $F$ is a Lie group homomorphism since $$F((n,h)(n',h'))=F(nhn'h^{-1},hh')=nhn'h^{-1}hh'=nhn'h'=F(n,h)F(n',h').$$ Therefore, $F$ has constant rank (Theorem 7.5) so, by the Global Rank Theorem, to show that it is a diffeomorphism it suffices to show that it is bijective. But if $F(n,h)=nh=e$ then, $h^{-1}nh=h^{-1}\in N\cap H=\{e\}$, so $h=e$ and $n=e$.

The Euler characteristic of their union is a valuation, i.e. $$\chi(A \cup B) = \chi(A) + \chi(B) - \chi(A \cap B)$$ And according to standard texts on integral geometry (e.g. Klain & Rota Introduction to Geometric Probability (2006)) this is continuous with respect to the distance metric above. However, explicitly the Euler characteristic is discontinuous: $$\chi(A \cup B) = \begin{cases}1 & \forall \; r < 2\sigma \\ 2 & \forall \; r > 2\sigma\end{cases}$$ whereas the Hausdorff distance between them is simply their separation $d_H(A,B)\equiv r$ . How is the Euler characteristic in my counter example continuous with respect to $d_H(A,B)$ ? Edit: It is quite rightly pointed out in the comments that Hadwiger’s theorem applies to strictly convex sets.

The problem states: Prove that a proper continuous map between smooth manifolds is homotopic to a proper smooth map between said manifolds. Let $M$ and $N$ be the manifolds with $F:M \to N$ a proper continuous map.  Since $F$ is continuous we automatically have the Whitney Approximation theorem: we can embed $N \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ for some $n$ and that $F$ is $\delta$ -close to a smooth map $\widetilde{F}: M \to \mathbb{R}^n$ .  Because $\widetilde{F}(M)$ can fit into some tubular neighborhood $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ of $N$ , we have there is a mapping $r: U \to N$ which is a retraction and a submersion into $N$ .  We can then take our homotopy to be $H: M\times [0,1] \to N$ given by $$ H(x,t) \;\; =\;\; r \left ( (1-t) F(x) + t\widetilde{F}(x) \right ). $$ The theorem shows that $F$ is homotopic to a smooth map $r\circ \widetilde{F}$ , but we want to show that $r\circ\widetilde{F}$ is proper . I'm somewhat lost as to proof strategies and need some help.  Lee hints that we need to show that $\tilde{F}$ is proper, and hopefully $r$ can easily show to be proper.  Where I'm getting stuck is in picking an arbitrary $K \subseteq N$ which is compact; how do we show $\widetilde{F}^{-1}(K)$ is compact as well?  I think we can pick a sequence in $\widetilde{F}^{-1}(K)$ and find a convergent subsequence.  Somewhere in there I'm assuming we need to use the fact that $||F(x) - \widetilde{F}(x)|| < \delta(x)$ for all $x \in M$ , given $\delta:M \to \mathbb{R}_+$ . Any help is appreciated on this.
