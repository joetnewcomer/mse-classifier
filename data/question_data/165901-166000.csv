Say that we define two processes $X,Y$ on different probability spaces $(\Omega^i,\mathcal{F}^i,\mathbb{P}^i)$ , $i=1,2$ and we take the product space. We redefine the processes by $X(\omega^1,\omega^2)=X(\omega^1)$ and $Y(\omega^1,\omega^2)=Y(\omega^2)$ . The product space is denoted $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})$ . By product space properties independence follows directly with this notion of independence of stochastic processes: Two stochastic processes $X:(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P}) \rightarrow (\mathbb{R},\mathcal{B},\lambda)$ and $Y:(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P}) \rightarrow (\mathbb{R},\mathcal{B},\lambda)$ ( $\lambda$ denotes the Lebesgue measure) are independent if \begin{align}\label{eq 1} \mathbb{P}((X_{t_1},\dots,X_{t_n})\in A \cap (Y_{s_1},\dots,Y_{s_m}) \in B) = \mathbb{P}((X_{t_1},\dots,X_{t_n})\in A)\mathbb{P}((Y_{s_1},\dots,Y_{s_m}) \in B) \\  \forall_{m,n \in \mathbb{N}} \quad \forall t_i,s_i \in [0,\infty) \quad \forall A \in \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^n), \forall B \in \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^m) \end{align} Also we define stopping times by the hitting times for some set in the ranges of $X$ and $Y$ (say $\mathbb{R}$ ). So denote the sets $A$ and $B$ then the stopping times are $T_X=\inf_{t \geq 0}\{X_t \in A\}$ and $T_Y=\inf_{t \geq 0}\{Y_t \in B\}$ . By product space properties these are also independent. (This is all logical up unto this point). But now say that $X_t$ and $Y_t$ are both distributed identically with some sort of distribution that depends on a parameter $\alpha$ . If $\alpha$ is deterministic there is no problem, but when $\alpha$ is stochastic there could be a problem. Now the independence is not a given since all finite dimensional distributions depend on $\alpha$ . So it would be natural to assume that given $\alpha$ we would have independence. So $T_X$ and $T_Y$ are conditionally independent, given $\alpha$ . The build of the model is easy. We just add a auxiliary probability space to the product space and extend definitions as before and view the new complete space. But how should we now handle the conditional independence as a probability statement (e.g. $\mathbb{P}(A \cap B|\alpha)=\mathbb{P}(A|\alpha))\mathbb{P}(B|\alpha)$ ? To make my question somewhat more specific: how does the conditioning on $\alpha$ work in the pre-image $T_X^{-1}(A)$ .

But if $\alpha$ is given, what form does this pre-image take? edit: I had the idea that if $\alpha$ is given, it is known that $\alpha=a$ for some $a \in range(\alpha)$ .

However, we cannot see the connection between probability space and random variable anymore. My question is that can we always define a random variable from a probability space? For example, I want to define a Bernoulli distributed random variable. We can start from a prob. space that $\Omega=\{H,T\}$ and $P(H)=p, P(T)=1-p$, then define the measurable function between prob.space and $(R,B)$ as $X(T)=1$ and $X(H)=0$. Or a prob. space that $\Omega=[0,1]$, and $P$ is the Lebesgue measure, and $F$ the collection of Lebesgue measurable sets. Then define $X(\omega)=1$ if $\omega<0.5$ and so on. Exponential distributed random variable is still OK, because the uniform distributed random variable can be defined by a identity function on the prob.space mentioned above, and we can apply the inverse function of the CDF of exponential distribution to define a exponential distributed random variable. However, if we go further to define Gaussian random variable. Can we do similar procedure as above to define it? What can I image is that we can invoke CLT to define a Gaussian from a $\Omega =\{H,T\} $ or $\Omega=[0,1]$. But it is not very clear. Also, if we continue the thinking, how to construct a complicate stochastic process?",,"['probability', 'measure-theory']"
