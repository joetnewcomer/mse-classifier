Now if we thought about how to adapt this definition to define a free $R$ -module over a ring $R$ which doesn't have unity, we run into problems immediately. For example, if we pick a basis $\{e_i\}$ , it's not even clear that we can express any member of this basis, like $e_1$ , in terms of the basis, since we can't write $e_1=1\cdot e_1$ any longer.

Hello fellow members of Math StackExchange! Since this is my first post here, I should start with a little introduction of myself. I've recently finished the second year of math at university and I did fairly well in the classes I took this semester (multivariable calculus, intro differential equations, intro linear algebra, intro abstract algebra). Out of the math topics I've been exposed to, I found myself to be drawn more to discrete math (algebra being by far my favourite).

The algebra course at my school was quite standard, following the groups-rings-fields path. We used Abstract Algebra: Theory and Applications by Tom Judson. We did skip over some chapters in the book, but I will finish learning them in my own time because I'm taking the summer semester off. However, because I get four months off in the summer, I'm hoping to also learn from a more advanced textbook, which leads to the main question of the post: What do you think is a good second textbook for self-studying abstract algebra for someone who has taken a semester of algebra?

99,Showing that $G/G_m$ and $G/G_n$ are isomorphic groups.,Showing that  and  are isomorphic groups.,G/G_m G/G_n,"Let $G$ be the multiplicative group of complex numbers of modulus $1$ and let $G_n$ (with $n$ a positive integer) be the subgroup consisting of the $n$-th roots of unity. For positive integers $m$ and $n$, I want to show that $G/G_m$ and $G/G_n$ are isomorphic groups. I can't even prove that the natural map is well defined. Please help me. Thanks.","Let $G$ be the multiplicative group of complex numbers of modulus $1$ and let $G_n$ (with $n$ a positive integer) be the subgroup consisting of the $n$-th roots of unity.
