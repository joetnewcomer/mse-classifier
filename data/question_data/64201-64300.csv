1,An interesting identity regarding partitions of $m$ into powers of two,An interesting identity regarding partitions of  into powers of two,m,"This question appeared in an exam I was giving- Suppose we have $n$ balls and we place them in a sequence of bins as follows. At least one ball is put into the first bin, and each successive bin has at least as many balls as all the previous bins combined . This process is continued until all the balls have been placed into bins. Prove that the number of ways of doing this is the same as the number of partitions of n into powers of 2, not necessarily distinct. Note: $1=2^0$ is also considered a power of two. I think this identity is superb. It breaks my brains to even think that the two processes are equivalent. But, that doesn't help me to solve it. All I can think of is that the tightest case of putting balls into bins is $1,1,2,4,8,\dots$ which is the sequence of powers of two.

It is well known that there are $2^{(2^n)}$ such functions, because for each of $2^n$ possible input vectors you can choose the result.  Moreover, all these functions can be constructed with AND, OR, NOT, e.g. using disjunctive normal form.  (Obviously we allow each input $x_i$ to appear multiple times in the logic formula.)  My question is: How many such functions can be constructed if you can use AND, OR, but you cannot use NOT? As usual, a function is defined by its outputs.  So two different-looking formulas that agree on every input counts as the same function, e.g. $(x_1 \land x_2) \lor x_3$ is the same function as $(x_1 \lor x_3) \land (x_2 \lor x_3).$ My thoughts: At the very minimum, the function now must return $1$ when all inputs are $1$s, and must return $0$ when all inputs are $0$s.  (Note: constant functions $f\equiv 1$ and $f\equiv 0$ cannot be constructed using AND, OR, without NOT and without the literals $1, 0$ themselves.)  This upperbounds the number to $2^{(2^n-2)}$, because for those two input vectors you no longer have a choice of output.  However, I suspect this bound is extremely loose. More generally, consider input vectors $x$ and $y$ where $x_i = 1 \Rightarrow y_i = 1$ (or equivalently, $y_i = 0 \Rightarrow x_i = 0$).  Then I think any function with $f(x) = 1$ forces $f(y) = 1$, and similarly $f(y) =0$ forces $f(x) = 0$.  This is because turning some $0$s in the input into $1$s cannot decrease the output if you are only combining with AND, OR, but without NOT.  (However, I am not sure how to make this reasonsing rigorous...  maybe assume a tree structure of the formula and recurse up the tree?) Anyway, assuming the previous paragraph is correct, then it seems one approach is to consider an input vector $x$ as the subset of indices $\{i: x_i = 1\}$.

However: (A) I have no idea how to count the number of such surfaces/cuts, and (B) I am not sure every such surface/cut can be constructed with AND, OR, but without NOT.  (I think each surface/cut can be constructed, as a disjunctive normal form of the ""minimal"" subsets for which $f = 1$, but I'm not perfectly sure.  Anyway if some surface/cut cannot be constructed, this would still provide an interesting upperbound on the number of such functions.) Further motivation: My original motivation was actually how many functions of $n$ real variables can be constructed by composing with $\max(,)$ and $\min(,)$, allowing each variable to appear multiple times in the formula.  However, after I noticed that $\max(x,\min(y,z)) = \min(\max(x,y), \max(x,z))$, I think they act like the Boolean AND, OR, so I think the questions are actually equivalent.

It seems a hard problem to me. $1$ and $9$ have one consecutive digit while others have two. This makes the problem harder a bit. So I tried to establish a recurrence relation. For $2\leq n\leq 9$, if the number of such numbers is $A_n$, we can use $A_{n-1}$. For each such $(n-1)-$digit numbers, we can find $n-2$ such $n-$digit numbers.

83,Counting the number of sequences with these properties.,Counting the number of sequences with these properties.,,"The following question was given on an exam I wrote, and I would like to see if anyone can identify any problems with my solution. I would also be very interested if anyone has a more elegant solution. Note: if my solution is too long to look over, I won't mind if you ignore it and volunteer your own solutions to the question . Question : How many sequences of 21 coin flips consisting of 15 tails and 6 heads satisfy the following three properties: 1) the first and last coin flip results in tails; 2) there are no consecutive occurrences of heads; 3) every sequence of consecutive tails has odd length. Below is an outline of my solution: We suppose the first and last coin flip results in a tails and count the number of sequences of 19 coin flips with 13 tails and 6 heads (and adjust the above conditions appropriately). Case #1: There is a head immediately after the first tails and immediately before the last tails. The number of such sequences is given by counting how many ways we can choose the size of the ""gap"" between consecutive heads. Since we require that consecutive sequences of tails have odd length, we must have that the gaps between successive heads are of odd length. In particular, they may take the values $\{1, 3, 5, 7\}$. Solving this is equivalent to distributing 13 identical objects into 5 distinct boxes such that no box is empty. This is given by ${(13-5)+5-1\choose (13-5)}= {12 \choose 8} = {12 \choose 4}$. Case #2: There is a head immediately before the last tails, but there is some odd-length sequence of consecutive tails at the start of the sequence. Since we fixed the first tail, there must be some even-length sequence of tails following the first tail. We observe that the length of this sequence is, at most, 8 (otherwise we have an occurrence of consecutive heads). So then the length of this initial sequence of tails (not counting the first tail we fix) takes values in $\{2, 4, 6, 8\}$. The number of sequences of this form is given by: $\displaystyle\sum_{k}{(13-k-5)+5-1\choose (13-k-5)}$, for $k \in \{2,4,6,8\}$. Case #3: This case is the same as the previous one, except we consider those sequences where there is a head immediately after the first tails, and some odd-length sequence of tails at the very end (counting the last tail we fix). Case #4: In this final case, we consider all such sequences where there is some even-length sequence of consecutive tails immediately after the first tail and immediately before the last tail. As by our previous remark, these two sequences cannot have a combined length of greater than 8. So then the possible lengths of these initial and terminal sequences of consecutive tails is given by the ordered pairs $(2,2), (2, 4), (4,2), (4,4)$. So then if we index these lengths, we have $j \in \{4, 6, 8\}$, and the number of such sequences is given by ${(13-j-5)+5-1\choose (13-j-5)}$ for each $j \in \{4, 6, 8\}$ except that for $j=6$ we multiply by two since there are two such possibilities.","The following question was given on an exam I wrote, and I would like to see if anyone can identify any problems with my solution.

Since we require that consecutive sequences of tails have odd length, we must have that the gaps between successive heads are of odd length. In particular, they may take the values $\{1, 3, 5, 7\}$. Solving this is equivalent to distributing 13 identical objects into 5 distinct boxes such that no box is empty. This is given by ${(13-5)+5-1\choose (13-5)}= {12 \choose 8} = {12 \choose 4}$. Case #2: There is a head immediately before the last tails, but there is some odd-length sequence of consecutive tails at the start of the sequence. Since we fixed the first tail, there must be some even-length sequence of tails following the first tail. We observe that the length of this sequence is, at most, 8 (otherwise we have an occurrence of consecutive heads). So then the length of this initial sequence of tails (not counting the first tail we fix) takes values in $\{2, 4, 6, 8\}$. The number of sequences of this form is given by: $\displaystyle\sum_{k}{(13-k-5)+5-1\choose (13-k-5)}$, for $k \in \{2,4,6,8\}$. Case #3: This case is the same as the previous one, except we consider those sequences where there is a head immediately after the first tails, and some odd-length sequence of tails at the very end (counting the last tail we fix). Case #4: In this final case, we consider all such sequences where there is some even-length sequence of consecutive tails immediately after the first tail and immediately before the last tail. As by our previous remark, these two sequences cannot have a combined length of greater than 8. So then the possible lengths of these initial and terminal sequences of consecutive tails is given by the ordered pairs $(2,2), (2, 4), (4,2), (4,4)$. So then if we index these lengths, we have $j \in \{4, 6, 8\}$, and the number of such sequences is given by ${(13-j-5)+5-1\choose (13-j-5)}$ for each $j \in \{4, 6, 8\}$ except that for $j=6$ we multiply by two since there are two such possibilities.",,"['combinatorics', 'proof-verification']"
84,Generating Function for Binary String Question,Generating Function for Binary String Question,,"The following is an assignment question I have been trying to work out for quite some time.

I know that the first step is to find a recurrence relation for $c_{n,k}$. Consider a arbitrary binary string of length $n$ with $k$ blocks. The first digit is either zero or one; the difference is immaterial. The second digit is either the same or the opposite of the first digit. In the first case, when the second digit is the same as the first, there are $k$ blocks in the $(n-1)$ digit long substring. The number of such substrings is $c_{n-1,k}$. In the second case, when the second digit is different than the first, one block has been found and so $(k-1)$ blocks remain in the $(n-1)$ digit long substring.

This gives the following recurrence relation: \begin{equation} c_{n,k}=c_{n-1,k}+c_{n-1,k-1}. \end{equation} If $k>n$, then $c_{n,k}=0$ because there is no way to have more blocks of digits than digits in a binary string.

The hope is to shuffle the list in such a way that no two students are adjacent that were before. But my problem is there seems no simple way of characterising these shuffles. Maths So suppose we have an ordered list of n elements (possibly it will be easier to consider it as cyclic list, so that n is adjacent to 1), how can one reliably generate the maximum number of reorderings of that list in which no two reorderings share adjacent pairs?

97,Rubik's cube and counting,Rubik's cube and counting,,"Inspired by this question , I formulate the following: Suppose I have a $3\times3\times3$ Rubik's cube, call each small square on the surface a piece, there are then $3*3*6 = 54$ pieces. Enumerate the 54 pieces by $[54]:=\{1,2,\cdots,54\}$ . Given a permutation $\sigma$ of $[54]$ , for every $k\in [54]$ we replace the piece numbered by $k$ with the piece numbered by $\sigma(k)$ . Question: Consider the set of all permutations of $[54]$ and their corresponding coloring of the cube, how many different Rubik's cube colorings can I get? Two colorings are different if they cannot be obtained from another by any sequence of legal Rubik's cube movement. I plan to tackle the question by Burnside's Lemma, and essentially count the number of orbits in the motion group of Rubik's cube. Further question Is there a closed form formula for number of orbits under Rubik's motion group for a $n\times n\times n$ Rubik's cube?","Inspired by this question , I formulate the following: Suppose I have a Rubik's cube, call each small square on the surface a piece, there are then pieces.

98,What quantifies as a rigorous proof?,What quantifies as a rigorous proof?,,"Okay I have been thinking about this common combinatorial identity. $$\sum_{r=0}^{n} \binom{n}{r} = 2^n.$$ It is simple to prove this by induction, but it requires some annoying algebraic manipulation which involves other combinatorial identities. What about if we took an approach that takes into factor a specific rephrase of the problem? My approach is this. Consider a combination lock with n number of on-off switches. To open it require turning on the correct switches. How many combinations are there? clearly, the first switch can be on or off, second on and off etc. so the combintions are $2^n$ We look at it from a different angle. How many ways are there to pick one on switch. $\dbinom{n}{1}$. what about picking 2 switches? $\dbinom{n}{2}$... and so on. Since the number of combinations are supposed to be the same,it gives us the identity. Now i know this explanation is not rigorous, but can someone point out exactly to me exactly which part of it it fails to be so? I have also encountered this problem in man other areas of mathematics when I try to prove something, I used a specific problem to do so and thus I doubt the validity of the proof. I can give more examples if needed","Okay I have been thinking about this common combinatorial identity. $$\sum_{r=0}^{n} \binom{n}{r} = 2^n.$$ It is simple to prove this by induction, but it requires some annoying algebraic manipulation which involves other combinatorial identities.
