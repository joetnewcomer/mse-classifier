I know that if we fix $m \in S^1$ , the subspace $S^1 \times \{m\}$ is homeomorphic to $S^1$ and is a retract of the Torus via the mapping $f: S^1 \times S^1 \to S^1 \times \{m\}$ given by $f(x,y) = (x,m)$ .

Munkres, 2nd edition: ... Consider the minimal uncountable well-ordered set $S_\Omega$ , in the order topology. The space $S_\Omega$ is not compact, since it has no largest element. However, it is limit point compact. Let $A$ be an infinite subset of $S_\Omega$ . Choose a subset $B$ of $A$ that is countably infinite. Being countable, the set $B$ has an upper bound $b$ in $S_\Omega$ ; then $B$ is a subset of the interval $\left[ a_0, b \right]$ of $S_\Omega$ , where $a_0$ is the smallest element of $S_\Omega$ . Since $S_\Omega$ has the least upper bound property, the interval $\left[ a_0, b \right]$ is compact. By the preceding theorem, $B$ has a limit point $x$ in $\left[ a_0, b \right]$ . The point $x$ is also a limit point of $A$ . Thus $S_\Omega$ is limit point compact. Now my question is related to the following part of this example. The space $S_\Omega$ is not compact, since it has no largest element. In general, we can prove the following: Let $X$ be a simply ordered set, in the order topology. If $X$ has no smallest element or if $X$ has no largest element, then $X$ is not compact. In other words, if a simply ordered set $X$ in the ordered topology is compact, then $X$ must have a smallest element and a largest element. Proof: Suppose that $X$ has a smallest element $a$ but that $X$ has no largest element. Then the collection $$ \mathscr{A} \colon= \left\{ \ [a, x) \ \colon \ x \in X, x > a \ \right\} $$ is an open covering of $X$ . If there were a finite sub-collection of $\mathscr{A}$ that also covered $X$ , say, the collection $$ \mathscr{A}_0 \colon= \left\{ \ \left[ a, x_1 \right), \ldots, \left[ a, x_n \right) \ \right\},$$ then we would have $$ X = \bigcup_{i=1}^n \left[ a, x_i \right) = \left[a, x_* \right), \tag{1}$$ where $$ x_* \colon= \max \left\{ \ x_1, \ldots, x_n \ \right\}. $$ But this would yield a contradiction because $x_*$ is an element of $X$ , by our construction, but from (1) we would obtain $x_* \not\in X$ . Hence $X$ cannot be compact if $X$ has no largest element even if $X$ does have a smallest element. By analogous reasoning we can also show that if $X$ has no smallest element, then $X$ cannot be compact, even if $X$ does have a largest element. Am I right? Now what about the converse?

We would like to define one notion of completeness which captures the idea of ""missing points"". For example $\mathbb{R}^n\setminus \{0\}$ should be incomplete in this sense.

A more exact version of the question is as follows: Let $(K,\Vert \cdot \Vert)$ be a complete valued field. The affine Berkovich space is defined as: $ A_K^{n, \text{an}}:=   \begin{Bmatrix}     &  \vert f+g\vert_x \leq \vert f\vert_x +\vert g\vert_x  \\     \vert \cdot \vert _x:K[x_1,...,x_n]\rightarrow [0,\infty) \quad \Bigg \vert  & \vert f\cdot g\vert_x= \vert f\vert_x \cdot \vert g\vert_x \\      &  \vert a\vert_x= \Vert a\Vert \; \text{for all } \; a\in K   \end{Bmatrix}  $ i.e, non-trivial multiplicative semi-norms on $K[x_1,...,x_n]$ extending $\Vert \cdot \Vert$. Given a Banach ring $(A,\Vert \cdot \Vert)$, it's Berkovich  spectrum is: $ \mathcal{M}(A):= \begin{Bmatrix}    \text{multiplicative bounded seminorms}  \\    \vert \cdot \vert : A \rightarrow [0,\infty)    \end{Bmatrix}  $ They both have the weakest topology induced by evaluations. I have been trying to understand what is the relation between $A_K^{n, \text{an}}$ and a Berkovich spectrum of $K[x_1,...,x_n]$. They would coincide were it not for the extra assumption of boundedness. I saw somewhere that the Berkovich affine space is not a Berkovich spectrum, but instead an increasing union of Berkovich spectrums of power rings. I have not found thus far how these spectrums are defined, and would appreciate anyone explaining, or directing to a reference where it is indeed written.",,"['general-topology', 'algebraic-geometry', 'spectra', 'geometric-functional-analysis']"

32,A Countable Basis and Countably Locally Finite Collections,A Countable Basis and Countably Locally Finite Collections,,"Show that if $X$ has a countable basis, a collection $\mathcal{A}$ of subsets of $X$ is countably locally finite if and only if it is countable. I am going to give my proof of the $\impliedby$ implication first. Suppose that $\mathcal{A}$ is a countable collection of subsets of $X$ . Then we can enumerate them by $\Bbb{N}$ likeso: $\mathcal{A} = \{A_n \mid n \in \Bbb{N}\}$ . But then $\mathcal{A} = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty \{A_n\}$ , where $\{A_n\}$ is locally finite since any given open set can intersect at most one set in $\{A_n\}$ , and hence, intersect finitely many sets in $\{A_n\}$ . This means that $\mathcal{A}$ is countably locally finite. For the other direction, I am having a little trouble. A countably locally finite set can be written as a countable union of locally finite sets, so it seems that it suffices to show any locally finite collection is countable. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be any such collection. As with most arguments about cardinality, it seems that my best option is to construct a function $f : \mathcal{B} \to \mathcal{A}$ that is surjective. Here's an attempt. Assume that $A \in \mathcal{A}$ is not empty. Then there exists $a \in A$ , and since $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis $B \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $a \in B$ , so that $A \cap B \neq \emptyset$ . So we might define $f(B) = A$ such that $A \cap B \neq \emptyset$ (note: there could be may sets in $\mathcal{A}$ satisfying this, so perhaps this won't work...?) Is it well-defined? Well, if $B=B'$ , then $\emptyset \neq A \cap B = A \cap B'$ , which I guess means that $f(B) = f(B')$ (?). But by definition, this is surjective, so $|\Bbb{N}| = |\mathcal{B}| \ge |\mathcal{A}|$ , implying that $\mathcal{A}$ is countable. As the periodic question marks in the above paragraph indicate, I don't feel terribly comfortable with some parts of the proof. Another thing is, I don't seem to use $\mathcal{A}$ 's local finiteness anywheree. Is there a way of clarifying the proof? If it's incorrect, is there a way of fixing it? If not, I could use a hint on how to prove the theorem. EDIT: Hold on! I may have a proof. Just give me a few minutes to type it up. Okay. My proof is slightly inspired by Henno's answer given here , although I didn't read the entire proof until I came up with my own, because I wanted to try to solve the problem own my own as much as possible (indeed, the only thing I saw in the link was his definition of $I(n)$ ). Here is my second attempt at proving the "" $\implies$ "" implication, which is I believe is slightly different from Henno's since I don't do a proof by contradiction. First, let $\mathcal{A} = \{A_i \mid i \in I\}$ be some locally finite collection. We want to show that $I$ is countable. For each $n \in \Bbb{N}$ , define $I(n) = \{i \in I \mid A_i \cap B_n \neq \emptyset \}$ . Clearly the union of these sets is contained in $I$ . Suppose that $i \in I$ . Then given $A_i \neq \emptyset$ , there exists $a_i \in A_i$ ; and since $\mathcal{B} = \{B_n \mid n \in \Bbb{N}\}$ is a basis, there exists an $n \in \Bbb{N}$ such that $a_i \in B_n$ , which implies that $i \in I(n)$ . Hence $I = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty I(n)$ , so that we need only prove that $I(n)$ is countable. To this end, let $n \in \Bbb{N}$ and let $x \in B_n$ . Since $\mathcal{A}$ is locally finite, there exists a basis element $B_{x_k}$ containing $x$ that intersects only finitely many elements in $\mathcal{A}$ . Hence, $\{B_{x_k}\}$ is a cover of $B_n$ , each of which intersects only finitely many sets in $\mathcal{A}$ ; moreover, since $\mathcal{B}$ is countable, $\{B_{k_x}\}$ must also be countable and hence can be enumerated likeso: $\{B_{\alpha_k} \mid k \in \Bbb{N} \}$ . Now, if $A_i \cap B_n \neq \emptyset$ , then it must also intersect a set in the cover of $B_n$ , which means that $I(n) \subseteq \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty I(\alpha_k)$ . Seeing as the latter set is a countable union of finite sets, which is makes it countable, $I(n)$ is als countable.

Could someone please tell me the use of taking bounded subsets here? Thank you very much for your help in this regard.","Claim: Suppose $X$ is a non-empty set and $d$ is a metric on $X$. Let $S(X)$ denote the collection of all non-empty closed bounded subsets of $X$. For each $A$ and $B$ in $S(X)$, define $$h(A,B) = \max~ \big ( ~\sup ~\{~ dist~(b,A)~|~b \in B ~\},~ \sup ~\{~dist~(a,B)~|~a \in A~ \}~ \big )$$ Then $h$ is a metric on $S(X)$. It is called the Hausdorff metric. Proof is as follows : However, I haven't been able to find an exact use for taking $S(X)$ as the set of all bounded subsets of $X$ which are also non empty and closed.
