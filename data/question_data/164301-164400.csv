1,A question about the definition of $p$-adic pseudo-measure.,A question about the definition of -adic pseudo-measure.,p,"Let $\mathfrak B$ be a profinite abelian group and let $\Lambda(\mathfrak B)$ be defined as the inverse limit $\varprojlim \mathbb Z_p[\mathfrak B/ \mathcal H]$ where the inverse limit is taken with respect to all the open normal subgroups $\mathcal H$ of $\mathfrak B$. In the book Cyclotomic fields and zeta values , it is said that an element of $\Lambda(\mathfrak B)$ defines a $p$-adic integral measure on $\mathfrak B$. I think it is fairly intuitive why an element of $\Lambda(\mathfrak B)$ should define such a measure, since a measure is basically a way of assigning numbers ($p$-adic in this case) to open subgroups of $\Lambda(\mathfrak B)$ and their cosets in such a way that they are disjoint additive. If the image of an element $\lambda \in \Lambda(\mathfrak B)$ under the projection to $\mathbb Z_p[\mathfrak B/\mathcal H]$ is written as $\sum\limits_{x \in \mathfrak B/\mathcal H} c_{\mathcal H}(x)x$, then we can think of this notation to mean that $\lambda$ assigns the $p$-adic integer $c_{\mathcal H}(x)$ to the coset $x$, and the inverse limit condition gives disjoint additivity. Next, the author defines what is called a $\textit{pseudo-measure}$. An element $\lambda$ in the total ring of fractions of $\Lambda(\mathfrak B)$ (localisation outside all zero-divisors) is said to a pseudo-measure if we have $$(g-1)\lambda \in \Lambda(\mathfrak B)$$ for all $g \in \mathfrak B$.

2,What is the advantage of Borel sigma algebras in defining probability spaces?,What is the advantage of Borel sigma algebras in defining probability spaces?,,"I'm trying to get the central concepts correct, so I'm going to express them without embellishment. A Borel $\sigma$ algebra is defined as a sigma algebra generated by a topological space     $(M,\mathcal{T})$. If $M$ is $\mathbb{R}$, it will typically     be the ""standard topology"" defined as the set of all open intervals. Because a $\sigma$ algebra is closed under intersection of infinitely-countably many sub-sets, we can prove that $\displaystyle\bigcap_{n\geq1}(a -\frac{1}{n},\,b)= [a,b)$. This step would not be possible within the topological space where only finite intersections are allowed. So we ""recover"" closed and half-closed intervals, thanks to the Borel $\sigma$-algebra. Now, the half-open intervals are in the sigma algebra (and so are closed intervals), and can be assigned a measure. So we went through quite a bit of maneuvering (assuming all this is correct) for what purpose? In particular, if we focus on probability spaces, the probability of a close interval is the same as an open interval, since the probability of any point in the real line is zero. Here is a tentative, unsophisticated, and crass way of looking at it (I'm posting it here to get further feedback): We can't assign a probability measure to $[0,1]$ because of Cantor's different types of infinites, and $2^Ω$ of $[0,1]$ being far too big, etc. But we want a smooth domain, so that we can get a nice $pdf$ to integrate over... Solution: start with the standard topology over the real line, and then ""fill"" the gaps by turning it into a sigma algebra.

6,What is an upper bound for the number of sets in a $\sigma$ - algebra generated by $n$ sets?,What is an upper bound for the number of sets in a  - algebra generated by  sets?,\sigma n,"I'm working through G. de Barra's book on measure theory, and have come across this question. The only information the book gives on generated $\sigma$-algebras is: Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a class of subsets of a space $X$. We call the smallest $\sigma$-algebra containing $\mathcal{A}$ the $\sigma$-algebra generated by $\mathcal{A}$. So far so good. Now to the question. Let $\mathcal{A}=\{A_1,\dots,A_n\}$ be our subclass of $n$ sets. Now I know, from other questions on the site, that the next step is to consider the set $\mathcal{K}$ containing elements of the form: $$A_{1}^{\gamma_1}\cap\dots\cap A_{n}^{\gamma_n}$$  where $\gamma_i\in \{0,1\}$ to be interpreted that $A_i^1=A_i$ and $A_i^0=A_i^c$. We then take all possible unions of the elements of $\mathcal{K}$ to generate the $\sigma$-algebra generated by $\mathcal{A}$. This gives an upper bound of $2^{2^{n}}$ distinct sets. What I don't quite get is the motivation for taking the elements of $\mathcal{K}$ as the ""atoms"" of the correct $\sigma$-algebra. Intuitively I sense that this does ensure that the gnerated sub-class is closed under complements and countable unions but I'd like a more rigorous reason as to why we first construct $\mathcal{K}$ and then look at its unions. All the answers I've seen on the site treat this step as trivial, but it did not seem to me the obvious place to start. Maybe there's a well-known proof showing that this method generates a $\sigma$-algebra containing $\mathcal{A}$ that I'm not aware of? EDIT: To be clear I'm asking why do other posts choose the set of all possible intersections and complements as their atoms. Is there a pretty way to see that this works, or is it just used because it can be proven (laboriously) that using them as your atoms will lead to the desired $\sigma$-algebra.

I don't know what to do to prove (a), could someone help me with that part and tell me if my solution to (b) is correct? Thanks in advance.","I am trying to show these two statements: Let $(\mathbb R^n,\mathcal M,m)$ where $m$ is the Lebesgue measure and $\mathcal M$ are the Lebesgue measurable sets, and let $(f_n)_{n \in \mathbb N}$ and $f$ in $L^p(\mathbb R^n)$ for $1 \leq p < \infty$. (a) $||f_n-f||_{L^p} \to 0 \implies ||f_n||_{L^p(\mathbb R^n)} \to ||f||_{L^p(\mathbb R^n)}$ (b) If $f_n \to f$ a.e. and $||f_n||_{L^p(\mathbb R^n)} \to ||f||_{L^p(\mathbb R^n)}$, then $||f_n-f||_{L^p} \to 0 $ There is a suggestion for part (b) which is to apply Fatou's lemma to the sequence $g_n(X)=2^{p-1}(|f_n(x)|^p+|f(x)|^p)-|f_n(x)-f(x)|^p$. I'll write what I could do: For part (b), I could not show that the suggested sequence $(g_n)_{n \in \mathbb N}$ is non negative, so instead I've used the sequence $h_n(x)=2^p(|f_n(x)|^p+|f(x)|^p)-|f_n(x)-f(x)|^p$. To apply Fatou's lemma to this sequence let's show non-negativity of the terms: $$|f_n(x)-f(x)|^p \leq (|f_n(x)|+|f(x)|)^p$$$$\leq 2^p\max\{|f_n(x)|,|f(x)|\}^p$$ $$\leq 2^p(|f_n(x)|^p+|f(x)|^p)$$ It follows that $h_n(x) \geq 0$. Notice that $\lim_{n \to \infty} h_n(x)=2^{p+1}|f(x)|^p$ a.e., applying Fatou's lemma we have $$\int_{\mathbb R^d} 2^{p+1}|f(x)|dx \leq \lim inf \int_{\mathbb R^d}2^p(|f_n(x)|^p+|f(x)|^p)-|f_n(x)-f(x)|^pdx$$$$=\int_{\mathbb R^d}2^p|f|^pdx+\int_{\mathbb R^d}2^p|f|^pdx-\lim sup \int_{\mathbb R^d}|f_n-f|^pdx$$ From here it follows $\lim sup \int_{\mathbb R^d}|f_n-f|^pdx=0$, so $||f_n-f||_{L^p(\mathbb R^d)}=0$.

It seems a bit suspect that both kinds of convergence are implicitly being allowed in the statement. But, I suspect this is fine.","f_n : \mathbb{R} \to [0,\infty] \mathbb{R} 0 \leq f_1 \leq f_2 \leq \ldots f f \int f  = \lim_{n \to \infty} \int f_n  f f_n x f_n(x) = n n f_n(x) \to \infty x_n \to \infty M < \infty N > 0 n \geq N x_n > M","['measure-theory', 'integration']"

Let $\mathcal{J}:=\{A\in\mathcal{M}|\mu(A^{c})=0\}\cup\{\emptyset\}$ 1) Prove that $\mathcal{J}$ is a topology on $X$ Any thoughts on how to start? (We have not had topology course yet..but our instructor says it should not be too difficult, I googled the axioms) I would appreciate help with this problem. 1) Since $X\in\mathcal{M}$ and $X\subset X$ , $\mu(X)=0$ from the completeness of the measure space, but then $0=\mu(X)=\mu(\emptyset^{c})\Rightarrow \emptyset\in J$ is this ok so far? Seems a bit pointless to do that as by the def of $\mathcal{J}$ the empty set is already there 2) how to show that the entire space $X\in\mathcal{J}$? 3) $\mathcal{J}$ is closed under any union of sets 4) closed under finite interesections","Let $(X,\mathcal{M},\mu)$ be a complete measure space.
