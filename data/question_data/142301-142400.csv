If $\epsilon =1$ then: $0\leq|x|<|x+1|$ implies that $x^2 < x^2+2x+1$ and then $x>-\dfrac{1}{2}$ . In particular, if $-\dfrac{1}{2}<x<\dfrac{1}{2} \Rightarrow |x|<\dfrac{1}{2} \Rightarrow \dfrac{1}{2} < x+1<\dfrac{3}{2}$ so that $|x+1|=x+1$ and then $\dfrac{1}{2}<|x+1| \Rightarrow \dfrac{1}{2|x+1|}<1$ . Since $|x|<\dfrac{1}{2}$ , then $\left| \dfrac{x}{x+1}\right| = \dfrac{|x|}{|x+1|} <\dfrac{1}{2|x+1|}<1$ . So $\delta=\dfrac{\epsilon}{2}$ stisfies the definition.

97,Limit evaluation.,Limit evaluation.,,In N. Piskunov he explained differential equations by taking up the example of air resistance acting on a falling body. After evaluating the differential equation he gets an equation for the velocity as: $$v = \left(v_o - \frac{mg}{k}\right)e^{-\frac{kt}{m}} + \frac{mg}{k}.$$ He then states that if $k = 0$ then the equation turns to the basic equation: $$v = v_o + gt.$$ Now I understand this statement because when air resistance is zero this velocity equation holds. However I am not able to prove this statement when I'm evaluating the limit: $$\lim_{k \rightarrow 0} \left[\left(v_o - \frac{mg}{k}\right)e^{-\frac{kt}{m}} + \frac{mg}{k} \right]$$ Any help evaluating the limit would be appreciated!,In N.
