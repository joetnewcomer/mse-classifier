9,Biggest Circle you can fit in a Hypercube,Biggest Circle you can fit in a Hypercube,,"In a unit square the biggest circle is of diameter 1. In a unit cube I have reasoned that the biggest circle is $\sqrt{\frac{6}{5}}$ (EDIT: (Full solution: $r = \sqrt{\frac{n}{8}}$) This reasoning is wrong; there are larger circles, only read this section if you enjoy seeing me work out the radius of a specific non-maximal class of circles in hypercubes. See below for my working after seeing people's answers.) In higher dimensions, I only speculate that the biggest circle has diameter $\sqrt{\frac{2n}{n+2}}$ My reasoning is as follows: To find the plane on which the biggest circle would lie, it seems reasonable to pick the farthest two corners $(0,0,0), (1,1,1)$, and then pick the midpoint of the vertical edges $(1, 0, \frac{1}{2}), (0, 1, \frac{1}{2})$. This gives a rhombus with diagonals $\sqrt{3}$ and $\sqrt{2}$ (the diagonals of the cube and the square at height $\frac{1}{2}$, respectively), and side lengths all $\sqrt{1^2 + \frac{1}{2}^2} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}$ Now, $(1, 0, \frac{1}{2}).(0, 1, \frac{1}{2}) = \frac{1}{4}$ so the cosine of the acute angle of the rhombus is $\frac{1}{4}/(\frac{\sqrt{5}}{2})^2 = \frac{1}{5}$, so the acute angle is $\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)$. The smallest distance between opposite sides (the height) of this rhombus is: $$\begin{aligned} \frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)\right) &= \frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}\left[\sin\left(\cos^{-1}(\frac{1}{5})\right)\right]\\ &=\frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}\sqrt{1 -\frac{1}{5^2}} \\ &=\sqrt{\frac{6}{5}}\end{aligned} $$ The circle centred at the centre of the rhombus has at most this diameter, since it will then meet the rhombus tangentially. My reasoning is not rigorous, but here's how it extends to higher dimensions: I presume the plane the circle lies on would include (wlog.) the diagonal of length $2$, $(0,0,0,0),(1,1,1,1)$ I also guess that the vectors $(1,0,\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}),(0,1,\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2})$ define the plane. These have length $\frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}$, dot product $\frac{2}{4}$ and hence angle $\cos^{-1}(\frac{2}{6})$. The height would then be: $$\begin{aligned} \frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}\left[\sin\left(\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{2}{6}\right)\right)\right] &=\frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}\sqrt{1 - (\frac{2}{6})^2}\\ &=\sqrt{\frac{8}{6}}\end{aligned}$$ And if this guess of a plane holds in dimension n: $$\begin{aligned} \left(1,0,\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},...\right)\cdot\left(0,1,\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},...\right) &= \frac{n-2}{4}\\ &= \left|\left(1,0,\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},...\right)\right|\\ &= \sqrt{\frac{n+2}{4}}\end{aligned}$$ gives angle $\cos^{-1}(\frac{n-2}{n+2})$ and height $\sqrt{\frac{n+2}{4}} \sqrt{1 - \frac{(n-2)^2}{(n+2)^2}}$ $= \sqrt{\frac{2n}{n+2}}$ So, on the assumption that this is a plane holding a circle of maximal diameter, the diameter would be $= \sqrt{\frac{2n}{n+2}}$, radius $= \sqrt{\frac{n}{4n+4}}$ so I could never fit a circle radius $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ in any hyper-cube. I'm asking for either justification or correction of this method. Is it right to assume that the plane cuts out a rhombus in higher dimensions? End of original question As was pointed out by Mark Bennet, a maximal circle in a cube $[-1,1]^3$ lies in the plane through the origin normal to $(1,1,1)$ and has radius $\frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}$ Here, I try to generalise Mark Bennet's example: (Please read with a critical eye) This plane intersects the cube at the six points whose coordinates have one $1$, one $-1$ and one $0$. These are the furthest points the plane reaches in the cube. The shortest lines between these points lie on the surface of the cube and can be expressed, symmetrically in the 3 coordinates, as $\pm(-1,t,1-t)$ with $ t \in [0,1]$ these lines make a hexagon with minimal distance $\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{2}^2 +\frac{1}{2}^2} = \frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}$ I've done this methodically so that I can generalise to higher dimensions. In higher dimension n there are two cases: n even: In this case, the hyperplane through the origin normal to $(1,1,..)$ reaches all corners of the hypercube that have $\frac{n}{2} 1$'s and $\frac{n}{2} -1$'s. Now we must pick a basis for the plane in this hyperplane that contains the largest circle. We can recover the circles given by @celtschk by using the basis vectors: $$\underbrace{(1,-1,1,-1\ldots,1,-1)}_{n}$$, and $$ \underbrace{(1,-1,1,-1\ldots}_{\frac{n}{2}} \underbrace{\ldots,-1,1,-1,1)}_{\frac{n}{2}}$$ That is, switching sign half way through so that they add to cancel the second half and subtract to cancel the first. Then the circle is given by: $$\{(\underbrace{\cos\phi,-\cos\phi,\ldots}_{\frac{n}{2}}, \underbrace{\sin\phi,-\sin\phi,,\ldots}_{\frac{n}{2}})|0\le\phi\le 2\pi\}$$ (since $(\underbrace{1,-1,\ldots}_{\frac{n}{2}}0,0,\ldots)$ and  $(0,0,\ldots\underbrace{-1,1,\ldots}_{\frac{n}{2}})$ are orthogonal, and $\phi = 0$ gives us their scaling.(largest scaling that fits in the cube)) which has radius $\sqrt{\frac{n}{2}}$ But can we pick a basis that gives a bigger circle? n odd:","In a unit square the biggest circle is of diameter 1.

The smallest distance between opposite sides (the height) of this rhombus is: $$\begin{aligned} \frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)\right) &= \frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}\left[\sin\left(\cos^{-1}(\frac{1}{5})\right)\right]\\ &=\frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}\sqrt{1 -\frac{1}{5^2}} \\ &=\sqrt{\frac{6}{5}}\end{aligned} $$ The circle centred at the centre of the rhombus has at most this diameter, since it will then meet the rhombus tangentially.

The height would then be: $$\begin{aligned} \frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}\left[\sin\left(\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{2}{6}\right)\right)\right] &=\frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}\sqrt{1 - (\frac{2}{6})^2}\\ &=\sqrt{\frac{8}{6}}\end{aligned}$$ And if this guess of a plane holds in dimension n: $$\begin{aligned} \left(1,0,\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},...\right)\cdot\left(0,1,\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},...\right) &= \frac{n-2}{4}\\ &= \left|\left(1,0,\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},...\right)\right|\\ &= \sqrt{\frac{n+2}{4}}\end{aligned}$$ gives angle $\cos^{-1}(\frac{n-2}{n+2})$ and height $\sqrt{\frac{n+2}{4}} \sqrt{1 - \frac{(n-2)^2}{(n+2)^2}}$ $= \sqrt{\frac{2n}{n+2}}$ So, on the assumption that this is a plane holding a circle of maximal diameter, the diameter would be $= \sqrt{\frac{2n}{n+2}}$, radius $= \sqrt{\frac{n}{4n+4}}$ so I could never fit a circle radius $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ in any hyper-cube.

These are the furthest points the plane reaches in the cube. The shortest lines between these points lie on the surface of the cube and can be expressed, symmetrically in the 3 coordinates, as $\pm(-1,t,1-t)$ with $ t \in [0,1]$ these lines make a hexagon with minimal distance $\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{2}^2 +\frac{1}{2}^2} = \frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}$ I've done this methodically so that I can generalise to higher dimensions. In higher dimension n there are two cases: n even: In this case, the hyperplane through the origin normal to $(1,1,..)$ reaches all corners of the hypercube that have $\frac{n}{2} 1$'s and $\frac{n}{2} -1$'s. Now we must pick a basis for the plane in this hyperplane that contains the largest circle. We can recover the circles given by @celtschk by using the basis vectors: $$\underbrace{(1,-1,1,-1\ldots,1,-1)}_{n}$$, and $$ \underbrace{(1,-1,1,-1\ldots}_{\frac{n}{2}} \underbrace{\ldots,-1,1,-1,1)}_{\frac{n}{2}}$$ That is, switching sign half way through so that they add to cancel the second half and subtract to cancel the first. Then the circle is given by: $$\{(\underbrace{\cos\phi,-\cos\phi,\ldots}_{\frac{n}{2}}, \underbrace{\sin\phi,-\sin\phi,,\ldots}_{\frac{n}{2}})|0\le\phi\le 2\pi\}$$ (since $(\underbrace{1,-1,\ldots}_{\frac{n}{2}}0,0,\ldots)$ and  $(0,0,\ldots\underbrace{-1,1,\ldots}_{\frac{n}{2}})$ are orthogonal, and $\phi = 0$ gives us their scaling.(largest scaling that fits in the cube)) which has radius $\sqrt{\frac{n}{2}}$ But can we pick a basis that gives a bigger circle? n odd:",,['geometry']

To give more explicit context, I'll explain the basic things we can do with vectors to approach real geometry problems. We can add or subtract vectors, e.g. $\overrightarrow{AB}+\overrightarrow{BC}=\overrightarrow{AC}$ . We can scale a vector by a coefficient (say $k$ ) so if $A,B,C$ lie on the same line and $k=\frac{AC}{AB}$ then $\overrightarrow{AC}=k\overrightarrow{AB}$ . In particular, 1. and 2. follows that if $X$ is on $AB$ , such that $\frac{AX}{XB}=\frac{t}{1-t}$ then $\overrightarrow{OX}$ $=\overrightarrow{OA}+\overrightarrow{AX}$ $= \overrightarrow{OA}+t\,\overrightarrow{AB}$ $= \overrightarrow{OA}+t(\overrightarrow{OB}-\overrightarrow{OA})$$= t\,\overrightarrow{OB}+(1-t)\,\overrightarrow{OA}$ . If some vectors form a basis, then every vector has unique representation as a linear combination of basis vectors with coefficients called ""coordinates"" (e.g. $\overrightarrow{i},\,\overrightarrow{j},\,\overrightarrow{k}$ is a classical basis for 3d Cartesian coordinates). Knowing only 1.-4. some problems like this (not in a way attention drawing) may be solved when a convinient basis is chosen, and even Ceva's_theorem , Menelaus's theorem , Thales' theorem can be proven, almost in an algebraic way. I'd call such ""linear vector problems"". But we know also Scalar (dot) product. By definition $\cos\angle BAC=\frac{\overrightarrow{BA}\cdot\overrightarrow{BC}}{ |\overrightarrow{BA}|\cdot|\overrightarrow{BC}|}$ , or, alternatively, $(\overrightarrow{BA}\cdot\overrightarrow{BC})=BA\cdot BC\cdot \cos\angle BAC$ . This implies such things like $(\overrightarrow{BA}\cdot \overrightarrow{BA})=(\overrightarrow{BA})^2=|\overrightarrow{BA}|^2=BA^2$ and $(\overrightarrow{BA}\cdot\overrightarrow{BC})=0\Leftrightarrow BA\perp BC$ unless $BA$ or $BC$ equals to zero. All distributive laws holds for addition/subtraction related to scalar or/and dot product. With 1.-5. such things like cosine rule , Heron's formula , Ptolemy's_theorem can be proven and I believe the problem above can be solved too.) We also know (though it's usage mostly limited by 3d Cartesian space) Cross product Having these tools, we can approach problems, where all conditions given and things to be proven/found are: parallelity, perpendicularity, fixed angles, intersection, intersection at a ratio (and maybe some others). But apparently we can't deal with circles, addition/subtraction of angles and many other things. But boiling a geometric problem down to algebra can be useful when no other ways seen. Other approaches are complex numbers or Cartesian coordinates, but vectors are unfairly less popular/known. I'd say, many vectors excercises are constructed just to train using vectors, instead of showing how real geometrical problems may be solved in an algebraic way. Arriving at regular geometrical solution I made the figure above in geogebra and started moving free point $D$ back and forth and see how the things change and I noted that somewhat asymmethrical that we have $3$ points on $AB$ and only two on $AE$ , I wanted inverse-image of $B$ to be present to. To construct it, I mirrored $B$ relative to $AE$ into $B'$ . By moving $D$ I noted that $BB'||CL||DK$ (and indeed, they all are perpendicular to $AE$ ) and that reminded me of Thales' theorem -- if we have say $F=BB'\cap AC$ then it would suffice to show that $DC=CF$ and use Thales' theorem. By ""method of gazely staring"" I found that $\triangle CFB\sim \triangle HEC$ , but it's obvious that $\triangle HEC\sim\triangle CEA$ , but $CA=CB$ and thus $CE=CF$ , but it's given that $CD=CE$ , which completes the proof. Geometrical solution, refined We take $F$ on the line $AC$ such that $BF||CL$ . $\angle FBC=\angle ECH$ , where $H=CL\cap EA$ . From right-angled $\triangle ECH$ : $\angle ECH=90^\circ -\angle CEH$ , but from right-angled $\triangle ECA$ : $\angle CAE=90^\circ -\angle CEH$ thus $\angle FBC=\angle ECH=\angle EAC$ hence $\triangle FBC$ and $\triangle EAC$ are congruent by ASA that follows $CF=CE$ , but it's given that $CD=CE$ thus $CF=CD$ and using Thales' theorem on lines $AB$ , $AC$ intersected by $BF \parallel CL \parallel DK$ we obtain $BL=LK$ , QED. But imagine I were at a contest without being able to use geogebra and move the point $D$ and to want to construct $BB'$ , then arriving at this solution with such additional constructions is highly doubtful. While vectors approach is pretty straightforward: algebraically express what's given and what's needed, solve algebraical problem, usually a linear equations system. That's why I want vectors solution. Other algebraical solutions, like Cartesian coordinates, complex coordinates or even something like barycentric coordinates are welcome as well.

Arriving at regular geometrical solution I made the figure above in geogebra and started moving free point back and forth and see how the things change and I noted that somewhat asymmethrical that we have points on and only two on , I wanted inverse-image of to be present to. To construct it, I mirrored relative to into . By moving I noted that (and indeed, they all are perpendicular to ) and that reminded me of Thales' theorem -- if we have say then it would suffice to show that and use Thales' theorem. By ""method of gazely staring"" I found that , but it's obvious that , but and thus , but it's given that , which completes the proof. Geometrical solution, refined We take on the line such that . , where . From right-angled : , but from right-angled : thus hence and are congruent by ASA that follows , but it's given that thus and using Thales' theorem on lines , intersected by we obtain , QED. But imagine I were at a contest without being able to use geogebra and move the point and to want to construct , then arriving at this solution with such additional constructions is highly doubtful. While vectors approach is pretty straightforward: algebraically express what's given and what's needed, solve algebraical problem, usually a linear equations system. That's why I want vectors solution. Other algebraical solutions, like Cartesian coordinates, complex coordinates or even something like barycentric coordinates are welcome as well.

He writes Of course, I have not written the above proof in a totally formal way. My question is, where would the difficulty arise if I tried to do so? which suggests to me that he believes the proof contains a serious flaw that can't be fixed by simply adding more detail. However I can't detect any such error. So how does the proof fail? To prevent the possibility of link-rot, the entire argument is as follows. Why isn't it obvious that a regular dodecahedron exists? What is wrong with the following argument for the existence of a regular dodecahedron, an argument which is supposed to describe what one actually does when making one out of cardboard? Draw a regular pentagon in the plane, and surround it by five further regular pentagons of the same size, each one sharing a different edge with the original pentagon. Now fold these upwards, all by the same angle, until they just touch each other, so that you have a sort of cup. The top of this cup consists of ten edges, two for each of the five further pentagons, that zigzag round roughly in a circle. Let us label the original pentagon A and the five subsequent ones B,C,D,E and F, ordered cyclically. The upper corners of the zigzag make an angle of exactly 108, the angle of a regular pentagon, since each one is formed by two edges of one of B,C,D,E or F. I claim that the same is true for the lower corners. This can be seen as follows. Consider the corner of the zigzag at the top of the edge e shared by B and C. If you reflect in the plane P that bisects the edge e, then the angle in question becomes one of the five angles of the base pentagon A. Therefore it is 108. Hence, there is a regular pentagon G, of the same size as all the other ones, which shares an edge with B and an edge with C. This argument works for the four other lower corners of the zigzag, giving pentagons H, I, J and K (again, let us say, in cyclic order and going round the same way as B, C, D, E and F). It is important to show that these pentagons fit together in the sense that G shares an edge with H, which shares an edge with I, and so on. This can again be done by reflecting in the plane P. It is not a bad idea to draw a picture at this point, but if you reflect in P, then G maps to A, and H maps to a pentagon that shares an edge with A and C, which means that it must be B or D. Since B maps to itself, H maps to D, which shares an edge with A. Thus, the reflected images of G and H share an edge, which implies that G and H share an edge (which can easily be checked by a more careful version of the above argument to be the right edge). By symmetry, we conclude that the pentagons G, H, I, J and K all fit together as they should. Every edge is now shared by two pentagons except for one edge each of G, H, I, J and K. By symmetry once again (rotating through 108 about a line through the bottom pentagon and perpendicular to it) these lines form a regular pentagon. To see that the symmetry group of the resulting shape is transitive in all the ways one wants, notice that, once we had chosen the bottom pentagon, there was no choice about how to choose all the rest, given the rule that two neighbours of a given pentagon sharing adjacent edges were required to share a further edge with each other. Hence, we could have started the process at any of the other pentagons and would have obtained the same shape. Therefore, any isometry of R^3 that maps one of the faces to another, with the outer and inner sides mapping to the outer and inner sides respectively, can be extended to a symmetry of the entire shape.

42,intersection of hypercube and hypersphere,intersection of hypercube and hypersphere,,"There is a number of similar questions already (e.g. this one ), but as far as I can see, none quite cuts it for me. In $n$-dimensional euclidean space, a hypercube $H$ with side lengths $2A$ is centered around the origin. So is a hypersphere $S$ with radius $x$. What is the fraction of volume of the hypercube $H$  that is also inside the hypersphere $S$, that is, what is the volume of $H\cap S$? As calculating the fraction with respect to the hypercube is trivial by just dividing by its volume in the end, it boils down to calculating the volume of the intersection. My first idea was to separate three different cases: If $x<A$ the hypersphere is fully contained in the hypercube. Then, the volume is simply the volume of the hypersphere, for which there are analytical formulae. If $x^2> n \cdot A^2$, the hypercube is fully contained in the hypersphere. In this case, the volume is simply that of the hypercube, that is, $(2A)^n$. For intermediate values of $x$, the intersection is given as the volume of the hypersphere minus $2n$ hyperspherical caps, for which there is also a closed form solution (e.g. here ) After my calculation consistently gave wrong results, I was forced to admit that the case (3) is more difficult than I thought, because as soon as the opening angle of the hypercaps is larger than $\pi/4$, they start to intersect along the edges of the hypercube, whereas the corners are still outside the intersection volume. For $n=3$, this can be seen in this graphic, which was generated by wolframalpha. Thus, the solution proposed in (3) double-counts these volumes. I can't seem to come up with general solution to calculate this, because counting (and calculating) the intersection areas is very tedious.

Artin carries out explicitly the attractive construction of defining an appropriate notion of translation (a map $\tau$ with no fixed points such that the line $PQ$ determined b $P$ and $Q$ is parallel to the line$\tau(P)\tau(Q)$ determined by $\tau(P)$ and $\tau(Q)$), showing that the translations form an abelian group, and then showing that the endomorphisms of this group that fix the directions of the translations (i.e. that fix the pencil of parallel lines determined by any/each of the lines $P\tau(P)$) actually form a division ring. Intuitively, the elements of this division ring are the scalars by which translations are scaled. Then the abelian group of translations turns out to be a 2-dimensional module, and since part of Desargues' theorem states that there exist translations between any two points, this successfully coordinatizes the affine geometry. If I have understood correctly, adding an ordering to the geometry translates into an ordering on the underlying division ring (hence making it a subfield of $\mathbb R$); distance translates into a norm on the module; angles translate into an inner product, so the above successfully models Euclidean geometry (keeping in mind the choice of the three non-collinear points: $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, $(0,1)$) as $\mathbb R^2$. The question My understanding of why what Artin does actually works is that the properties of translations crucially depend on the ""flatness"" of affine space, which is encoded by the parallel postulate (the parallel postulate seems to allow a kind of transport of incidence data around one point to another, it seems, and Desargues's theorem as used by Artin guarantees that all such transports are coherent with one another). Clearly, this is not true with hyperbolic geometry as it negates the parallel postulate. Nevertheless, I've read on numerous wikipedia pages that this negation is the only difference between the standard axioms of (plane) Euclidean geometry and (plane) Hyperbolic geometry. What I am curious about is whether it is possible to determine from primitive synthetic notions (points, lines, betweenness, congruence) the fact that hyperbolic geometry is a 2-dimensional Riemann surface manifold with constant negative curvature using a construction similar to the one I've read in Artin's book. Obviously, such a construction will be more sophisticated, as it would have to essentially select a coordinate chart around every point, together with transition maps (Artin's construction seems to construct one global chart for the whole of affine space). Any references, explanations, or corrections would be much appreciated.

57,Inscribing Platonic solids in each other: why can't you put a dodecahedron in an octahedron?,Inscribing Platonic solids in each other: why can't you put a dodecahedron in an octahedron?,,"Given convex polyhedra $P, Q$ , say that one can inscribe $P$ in $Q$ if we can find points on the surface of $Q$ whose convex hull is similar to $P$ . If we restrict $P, Q$ to be Platonic solids, we can achieve every case except inscribing the dodecahedron into the tetrahedron, cube, or octahedron; the other $17$ distinct pairs work. For the $17$ working cases, there are ""nice"" constructions, where the solids are positioned in symmetric ways with respect to each other. Consequently, such constructions are pretty easy to verify by a combination of symmetry arguments, direct computation of one or two distances, and arguments from degrees of freedom / continuity. To see examples of these pairs, Moritz Firsching's 2018 paper ""Computing maximal copies of polytopes contained in a polytope"" (PDF link via arXiv.org) shows instances of maximal containment, most of which have ""nice"" symmetry (or are obviously given by e.g. taking duals). Perhaps the hardest case to see a ""nice"" construction for is the cube inside the tetrahedron, pictured below (bold edges tangent to the faces): For two of the three impossible cases, I have simple proofs of impossibility: If a dodecahedron were inscribed in a tetrahedron, every face would need to have a pentagon on it, but the dodecahedron doesn't have four mutually disjoint faces. If a dodecahedron were inscribed in a cube, then any face with at least three of the vertices of the dodecahedron would have to have an entire pentagon on it (and no more of the vertices), since three points determine a plane and the dodecahedron is convex. Then (by simple counting) at least three of the cube's faces must have such a pentagon on them, so two such are orthogonal to each other. But the dodecahedron has no orthogonal faces. However, I know of no such proof that the dodecahedron cannot be inscribed in the octahedron; it seems fairly plausible, at first glance, that one could mount the dodecahedron with two opposite faces tangent to opposite faces of the octahedron and arrange the other $10$ points across the other $6$ faces of the octahedron somehow. The simplest proof I know involves doing some gross trigonometry involving the necessary side length of such a dodecahedron and the inradius of the regular $10$ -gon formed by taking an equatorial cross-section of the dodecahedron in between these two opposite faces. Is there a conceptually simple proof that this construction is impossible? I realize this is somewhat subjective, but I hope the intended style of argument is clear: reasoning from symmetry and combinatorial incidences, rather than bashing the coordinates of different vertices.","Given convex polyhedra , say that one can inscribe in if we can find points on the surface of whose convex hull is similar to .

71,Finding all 15-ominoes that tile the plane and have distinct internal adjacencies,Finding all 15-ominoes that tile the plane and have distinct internal adjacencies,,"Problem Description: This problem oddly came up in Minecraft with some friends. Not sure what the best terms are; but that's partly why I'm here. So a polyomino is built up from squares. This problem is to find 15-ominoes (pentdecominoes?) that tile the plane where each square inside has a distinct ""adjacency fingerprint"" so to speak; meaning that no two squares look the same when zoomed in on based on their directly adjacent neighbors. More formally, you give every square in the polyomino one of sixteen signatures $\sigma\in \{ 0,1\}^4 $ based on whether or not it's connected to another square in the same polyomino in the north/south/east/west direction (or +y/-y/+x/-x direction equivalently). The constraint is that no two squares in the polyomino have the same signature. Pictures of solutions might help to clarify what I'm trying to say. Solutions so far: Here's a couple we found already: two solutions image / minecraft screenshot We also found a few disconnected shapes with these properties (so 15 or 16 squares with distinct adjacencies forming a rigid-but-disconnected shape that can tile the plane): three disconnected tile solutions / minecraft screenshot The 2nd images shows the relationship to Minecraft a bit. Two fence blocks placed next to each other in Minecraft will link. Thus any fence block in the game can take on 16 possible different shapes depending on whether it has a connection to the north/south/east/west. We're looking for fence linkages having all 15 connecting shapes (or all 16 if disconnected solutions are allowed since the 16th shape is just a totally unconnected fence post). Our attempts: We've tried a lot to solve this from adjacency matrices to programs that brute-force generate every possible 15-omino with this square-adjacency-constraint. Brute-forcing doesn't even work even with our clever search-space-pruning tricks. My next thought was to look up lattices and 2d tilings and just learn what constraints a tiling 15-square shape has to obey. My hope was that tiling constraints paired with the adjacency constraints would be enough to fully enumerate all solutions. But when I started researching lattices and tesselations, I was quickly overwhelmed and wasn't sure even what terms to look for. We've also figured out, based on the adjacencies, that any such solution must be at least 3 blocks wide (4 wide if it's a single connected polyomino) and no more than 7 wide in either dimension.

The following questions are based on the equations of Gauss, Codazzi and Ricci: $\textbf{1)}$ What is the motivation which Gauss, Codazzi and Ricci had when deriving their formulas? Why do we precisely look at the objects appearing in these equations? At first sight it seems to me that many other relations could be derived. What makes these equations so special? $\textbf{2)}$ What is the meaning of $[A_{\xi}, A_{\eta}] =A_{\xi}A_{\eta} - A_{\eta}A_{\xi}$?

84,Geometric notion of addition for the real projective line,Geometric notion of addition for the real projective line,,"The real projective line $\mathbb{RP}^1 = \mathbb{R} \cup {\infty}$ is usually identified with (or defined as) the set of lines passing through the origin in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Thus, the number $m\in \mathbb{R}$ corresponds to the unique line with finite slope $m$, and $\infty$ corresponds to the unique vertical line. Algebraically, we can define the usual extensions of addition, multiplication, negatives and reciprocals from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{RP}^1$, with a few cases left undefined. My goal is to find a good geometric interpretation of these operations. Geometrically, given a line $a \in \mathbb{RP}^1$, the additive inverse $-a$ and reciprocal $\frac{1}{a}$ can be clearly constructed as respective reflections over the lines $0$ and $1$. On a similar way, multiplication of projectively extended real numbers is just composition of the underlying linear relations, and can be computed geometrically by passing to $\mathbb{R}^3$. To construct $a\cdot b$, one first extends the line $a$ in XY perpendicularly to a plane, then does the same with the line $b$ in YZ, and finally projects the intersection of these two planes onto XZ to find the desired product: This allows one to find, for example, a consistent meaning to the expression $0 \cdot \infty$ by including the elements of the two trivial Grassmannians $\bot \in \mathrm{Gr}(0, 2)$ and $\top \in \mathrm{Gr}(2, 2)$ among the possible outcomes of multiplication, as is pointed out here . In fact, the composition of any two functions or relations $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ can be performed in this way using their graphs in $\mathbb{R}^2$. On the other hand, so far I haven't been able to find any geometric interpretation of addition in the projective line. So my question is: How can we construct the sum of two lines in $\mathbb{RP}^1$ geometrically? To be more specific, by ""geometrically"" I mean in the sense of classical compass-and-straightedge constructions and their obvious generalization to higher dimensions (for example, one is allowed to construct a plane passing through three nonaligned points, a sphere given a point and a radius, take intersections, etc.). Alternatively, since the three notions above are still valid if we replace lines with the graphs of arbitrary relations, it could be interesting to look for an answer that is generalizable in this sense (if it exists). In any case, an acceptable construction should be able to reproduce the addition of real numbers, and the identities $\infty + a = a + \infty = \infty$ for any $a \neq \infty$. What I've tried The first thing that came to my mind is to use an auxiliary vertical line at a nonzero distance from the origin: Unfortunately this approach breaks down for vertical lines.

The walls of the room are mirrors, and there is a man with a laser gun standing somewhere else in the room.  The man is also a point, and both of your positions are fixed points, that is, neither of you can move.  A beam from the laser will bounce off of the walls of the room at an angle equal to its angle of incidence.  To protect yourself, you are allowed to place any number of bodyguards (possibly infinitely many) at any points in the room.  The laser beam will stop if it hits a bodyguard. Is there an arrangement of finitely many bodyguards that completely protects you from being shot?  If so, what is the largest number of bodyguards you need to protect yourself no matter how you and the gunman are placed in the room? I encountered this problem a while back, and haven't been able to solve it.  An initial idea is to tile the plane with 'rooms' and translate your image into each square, but only draw the gunman in one of the tiles.  Then all possible fatal shots are represented by a segment from the shooter to one of your images.  Somehow, we must place bodyguards along these segments, and cover each one. A simple generalization of this problem is to begin with a room of a different shape (triangle, hexagon, circle, etc.).  I imagine these problems could get quite tough, for instance, my approach above would only work with shapes that tile the plane.","Suppose you are a point in a square room.
