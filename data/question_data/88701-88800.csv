(It's a weighted sequence space with the weights  $\omega_i = a^i$). It's elements are the sequences for which the norm is defined and finite. ( $\langle x_n,x_n \rangle = c ).$ The left and right shift operators are defined as usual: $S_r(({x_0 , x_1, x_2, ... x_n , ...})) = (0, x_0, ...)$  $S_l(({x_0 , x_1, x_2, ... x_n , ...})) = (x_1, x_2, ...)$ Now, I was asked to find $\sigma(S_r), \sigma(S_l)$. My attempt was this: I found the operator norm of both operators. $\lvert S_r\rvert = a$, $\lvert S_l\rvert = 1/a$. Then, I figured that $S_l$ has eigenvalues for every $\lambda$ satisfying $\lvert \lambda \rvert < 1/a$. Because the specturm is closed and bounded by the operator norm, i figured that $\sigma(S_l)$ is the closed ball with radius $1/a$. Additionaly, i found that $S_r ^ * = aS_l$, and therefore $Im(S_r - \lambda I)^\bot = Ker(aS_l - \bar{\lambda} I) = Ker(a(S_l - (\bar{\lambda}/a) I)) = Ker(S_l - (\bar{\lambda} / a) I) \neq 0 \Longleftrightarrow \bar{\lambda} / a < 1/a$. So i deduced that if $\lvert\lambda\rvert < 1$ so $\lambda \in \sigma(S_r)$. which doesn't make sense to me if $a < 1$ and then the spectrum has to be bounded by $\lvert S_r \rvert = a$.

( $\langle x_n,x_n \rangle = c ).$ The left and right shift operators are defined as usual: $S_r(({x_0 , x_1, x_2, ... x_n , ...})) = (0, x_0, ...)$  $S_l(({x_0 , x_1, x_2, ... x_n , ...})) = (x_1, x_2, ...)$ Now, I was asked to find $\sigma(S_r), \sigma(S_l)$. My attempt was this: I found the operator norm of both operators. $\lvert S_r\rvert = a$, $\lvert S_l\rvert = 1/a$. Then, I figured that $S_l$ has eigenvalues for every $\lambda$ satisfying $\lvert \lambda \rvert < 1/a$. Because the specturm is closed and bounded by the operator norm, i figured that $\sigma(S_l)$ is the closed ball with radius $1/a$. Additionaly, i found that $S_r ^ * = aS_l$, and therefore $Im(S_r - \lambda I)^\bot = Ker(aS_l - \bar{\lambda} I) = Ker(a(S_l - (\bar{\lambda}/a) I)) = Ker(S_l - (\bar{\lambda} / a) I) \neq 0 \Longleftrightarrow \bar{\lambda} / a < 1/a$. So i deduced that if $\lvert\lambda\rvert < 1$ so $\lambda \in \sigma(S_r)$. which doesn't make sense to me if $a < 1$ and then the spectrum has to be bounded by $\lvert S_r \rvert = a$.

It is known (e.g., Folland's Real Analysis , Exercise 8.23 (a -- c)) that $T h_k(x) = \sqrt{k + 1} h_{k + 1}(x)$, where $h_k(x)$ is the $k$th Hermite function (precise definition below).

We define $\ell^2$ to be the space of square-summable sequences, where we let the sequences be indexed starting at $0$ for convenience.  Then by $h_k(x)$ an orthonormal basis of $L^2(\mathbb{R})$, we know that the map $\iota: \ell^2 \to L^2(\mathbb{R})$ given by \begin{equation} \iota \left( (c_k)_{k = 0}^{\infty} \right) := \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty} c_k h_k(x) \end{equation} is an isomorphism of Hilbert spaces. I wish to relate conditions on the decay of the coefficients to the integrability of the resulting functions.  Let $$\mathfrak{L}_1 = \left\lbrace (c_k)_{k = 0}^{\infty} \in \ell^2: (\sqrt{k + 1} c_k)_{k = 0}^{\infty} \in \ell^2 \right\rbrace$$ and  $$\mathfrak{D}_1 = \left\lbrace f(x) \in L^2(\mathbb{R}): xf(x) \in L^2(\mathbb{R}), s \widehat{f}(s) \in L^2(\mathbb{R}) \right\rbrace,$$ where $\widehat{f}(s)$ is the Fourier transform of $f$, under the convention \begin{equation}  \widehat{f}(s) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int\limits_{\mathbb{R}} f(x) e^{- i \pi x \cdot s} \, dx, \quad f \in L^1(\mathbb{R}). \end{equation} I wish to show that $\iota (\mathfrak{L}_1) = \mathfrak{D}_1$. I can handle the inclusion $\iota (\mathfrak{L}_1) \subseteq \mathfrak{D}_1$. We know that \begin{equation} \tag{1} x h_k(x) = \sqrt{\frac{k + 1}{2}} h_{k + 1}(x) + \sqrt{\frac{k}{2}}h_{k-1}(x), \end{equation} so again, for finite linear combinations of Hermite functions there is no issue.  Moreover, for any $(c_k) \in \mathfrak{L}_1$, let $f = \iota (c_k)$, and let $P_n$ be the orthogonal projection onto $\text{span} \langle h_0, h_1, \dotsc , h_n \rangle$. By (1), for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $P_n f$ is in the domain of the multiplication-by-$x$ operator, hereafter denoted $M_x$.  Moreover, we discern the loose bound that for $m \leq n$, $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$, $$ \Vert M_x P_n f - M_x P_m f \Vert_{L^2}^2 \leq 2 \sum_{k = m - 1}^{n + 1} (k + 1) \vert c_k \vert^2, $$ so by $f = \iota(c_k)$ and $( \sqrt{k + 1} c_k) \in \ell^2$, we see that the sequence $( M_x P_n f)_{n = 1}^{\infty}$ is Cauchy in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$, hence convergent.  Obviously $P_n f \to f$ in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$, and $M_x P_n f \to g$ for some $g \in L^2(\mathbb{R})$; by closedness of $M_x$, we have that $f$ is in the domain of $M_x$ and $M_x f = \lim_{n \to \infty} M_x P_n f$.  In other words, $x f(x) \in L^2(\mathbb{R})$. By our convention on the Fourier transform, we have that (e.g., Folland, Real Analysis , Exercise 23h) that \begin{equation} \tag{2} \widehat{h}_k(s) = (-i)^k h_k(s); \end{equation} Hence, showing $s \widehat{f}(s) \in L^2(\mathbb{R})$ follows in essentially the same way. In my attempt to show $\mathfrak{D}_1 \subseteq \iota(\mathfrak{L}_1)$, I note first that for all $f \in \mathfrak{D}_1$, $f \in L^2(\mathbb{R})$ and $s \widehat{f}(s) \in L^2(\mathbb{R})$, then $f \in \mathcal{H}^1(\mathbb{R})$, the $L^2$-Sobolev space of first order, so in particular, the distributional derivative $f^{\prime}(x)$ is in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$. Since for $f \in \mathfrak{D}_1$, we also have that $x f(x) \in L^2(\mathbb{R})$, we see that $f \in \mathfrak{D}(T)$.  If the linearity holds, then by $Tf \in L^2(\mathbb{R})$, it will follow that $(\sqrt{k + 1} c_k) \in \ell^2$, and we will be done. Perhaps (probably!) it is just a mental block, but I am not as certain how the infinite limit holds in this direction.  Certainly $$ \langle T h_j, T h_k \rangle = (k + 1) \delta_{j, k}, $$ so we have some orthogonality to work with, but I do not see the passage to infinite sums, even under the hypothesis that $f \in \mathfrak{D}(T)$.","Question: Let $T$ be the unbounded operator on $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ defined by $$Tf(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( x f(x) - f^{\prime}(x) \right), $$ with domain $\mathfrak{D}(T)$ restricted to the set where $xf(x)$ and $f^{\prime}(x)$ are each, separately, in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ (and we permit $f^{\prime}(x)$ to be a distributional derivative).

We define $\ell^2$ to be the space of square-summable sequences, where we let the sequences be indexed starting at $0$ for convenience.  Then by $h_k(x)$ an orthonormal basis of $L^2(\mathbb{R})$, we know that the map $\iota: \ell^2 \to L^2(\mathbb{R})$ given by \begin{equation} \iota \left( (c_k)_{k = 0}^{\infty} \right) := \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty} c_k h_k(x) \end{equation} is an isomorphism of Hilbert spaces. I wish to relate conditions on the decay of the coefficients to the integrability of the resulting functions.  Let $$\mathfrak{L}_1 = \left\lbrace (c_k)_{k = 0}^{\infty} \in \ell^2: (\sqrt{k + 1} c_k)_{k = 0}^{\infty} \in \ell^2 \right\rbrace$$ and  $$\mathfrak{D}_1 = \left\lbrace f(x) \in L^2(\mathbb{R}): xf(x) \in L^2(\mathbb{R}), s \widehat{f}(s) \in L^2(\mathbb{R}) \right\rbrace,$$ where $\widehat{f}(s)$ is the Fourier transform of $f$, under the convention \begin{equation}  \widehat{f}(s) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int\limits_{\mathbb{R}} f(x) e^{- i \pi x \cdot s} \, dx, \quad f \in L^1(\mathbb{R}). \end{equation} I wish to show that $\iota (\mathfrak{L}_1) = \mathfrak{D}_1$. I can handle the inclusion $\iota (\mathfrak{L}_1) \subseteq \mathfrak{D}_1$. We know that \begin{equation} \tag{1} x h_k(x) = \sqrt{\frac{k + 1}{2}} h_{k + 1}(x) + \sqrt{\frac{k}{2}}h_{k-1}(x), \end{equation} so again, for finite linear combinations of Hermite functions there is no issue.  Moreover, for any $(c_k) \in \mathfrak{L}_1$, let $f = \iota (c_k)$, and let $P_n$ be the orthogonal projection onto $\text{span} \langle h_0, h_1, \dotsc , h_n \rangle$. By (1), for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $P_n f$ is in the domain of the multiplication-by-$x$ operator, hereafter denoted $M_x$.  Moreover, we discern the loose bound that for $m \leq n$, $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$, $$ \Vert M_x P_n f - M_x P_m f \Vert_{L^2}^2 \leq 2 \sum_{k = m - 1}^{n + 1} (k + 1) \vert c_k \vert^2, $$ so by $f = \iota(c_k)$ and $( \sqrt{k + 1} c_k) \in \ell^2$, we see that the sequence $( M_x P_n f)_{n = 1}^{\infty}$ is Cauchy in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$, hence convergent.  Obviously $P_n f \to f$ in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$, and $M_x P_n f \to g$ for some $g \in L^2(\mathbb{R})$; by closedness of $M_x$, we have that $f$ is in the domain of $M_x$ and $M_x f = \lim_{n \to \infty} M_x P_n f$.  In other words, $x f(x) \in L^2(\mathbb{R})$. By our convention on the Fourier transform, we have that (e.g., Folland, Real Analysis , Exercise 23h) that \begin{equation} \tag{2} \widehat{h}_k(s) = (-i)^k h_k(s); \end{equation} Hence, showing $s \widehat{f}(s) \in L^2(\mathbb{R})$ follows in essentially the same way. In my attempt to show $\mathfrak{D}_1 \subseteq \iota(\mathfrak{L}_1)$, I note first that for all $f \in \mathfrak{D}_1$, $f \in L^2(\mathbb{R})$ and $s \widehat{f}(s) \in L^2(\mathbb{R})$, then $f \in \mathcal{H}^1(\mathbb{R})$, the $L^2$-Sobolev space of first order, so in particular, the distributional derivative $f^{\prime}(x)$ is in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$. Since for $f \in \mathfrak{D}_1$, we also have that $x f(x) \in L^2(\mathbb{R})$, we see that $f \in \mathfrak{D}(T)$.  If the linearity holds, then by $Tf \in L^2(\mathbb{R})$, it will follow that $(\sqrt{k + 1} c_k) \in \ell^2$, and we will be done. Perhaps (probably!) it is just a mental block, but I am not as certain how the infinite limit holds in this direction.  Certainly $$ \langle T h_j, T h_k \rangle = (k + 1) \delta_{j, k}, $$ so we have some orthogonality to work with, but I do not see the passage to infinite sums, even under the hypothesis that $f \in \mathfrak{D}(T)$.",,"['functional-analysis', 'sobolev-spaces']"

We have an involution on $F(G)$: $$f^*(g)=\overline{f(g)}.$$ If we take the supremum norm on $F(G)$: $$\|f\|_\infty=\max_{g\in G}|f(g)|,$$ we have a C*-algebra.

The reason I did not just edit the last question about this is that I feel the answers I got were helpful, and this time around I have more detail to add. So, if $(X \times Y, \overline{\Sigma \times \tau}, \lambda)$ is a complete measure space, with $\lambda = \mu \times \nu$, then, if $f \in L^{1}(d\lambda)$, Fubini's theorem gives us:  $\int \limits_{X \times Y} f \,d\lambda = \int \limits_{X} \left [ \int \limits_{Y} f \,d\nu \right ] \,d\mu$.  We did not need to assume the space was $\sigma$-finite, because $f \geq 0$ being in $L^{1}(d\lambda)$ allowed us to construct a monotonically increasing sequence of simple functions supported on sets of finite measure which converge to $f$. But, my professor said that $\sigma$-finiteness is hidden in the hypothesis of Fubini's theorem.  Specifically, we proved that the following are equivalent: $\exists f > 0$ measurable such that $f \in L^{1}(d\lambda)$ $\iff$ $\lambda$ is $\sigma$-finite This statement was easy to prove.  Then, my professor said that when we are looking at $f \in L^{1}(d\lambda)$, we have $\int \limits_{X \times Y} f \,d\lambda = \int \limits_{X \times Y} f \chi_{ \{x \mid f(x) \neq 0 \} } \,d\lambda$, and the measure given by $\chi_{ \{x \mid f(x) \neq 0 \} }\,d\lambda$ is $\sigma$-finite.  This is because the positive part of $f$, $f^{+}$, is in $L^{1}( \chi_{ \{x \mid f(x) \neq 0 \} } \,d\lambda)$. Question 1: Okay, clearly $f^{+}$ is strictly positive, and also measurable with respect to $\lambda$.  How do I know that it is measurable with respect to $\chi_{ \{x \mid f(x) \neq 0 \} }\,d\lambda$? Also how would I show that $f^{+} \in L^{1}( \chi_{ \{x \mid f(x) \neq 0 \} }\,d\lambda)$?  I need to show that $\int \limits_{X} f^{+} \,d(\chi_{ \{x \mid f(x) \neq 0 \} }\,d\lambda) < \infty$.  I'm not sure how. Question 2: Since we have the above equivalence for $\sigma$-finite measures, given any measure space and any measure $\lambda$, if $f\in L^{1}(d\lambda)$, then the map $f \chi_{ \{ x \mid f(x) > 0 \} }$ is a positive measurable function in $L^{1}(d\lambda)$.

There is also the surface integral of a function $v\colon \partial\Omega \to \mathbb{R}$: $$|u| := \int_{\partial \Omega}fdS$$ where $dS$ is the surface density. To compute this quantity, we need to use a parametrisation. Now my question, is it always the case that $$\lVert u \rVert_{L^1(\partial\Omega)} \qquad\text{and}\qquad |u|$$ are equivalent? Does this hold for all the little variations of the $L^1$ norm in the first equation?? Now when we have a Lipschitz surface, these norms are equivalent (see Necas). BUT their definition of the $L^1$ norm is different so let us not use that result here. Edit : hmm, it seems $C^1$ domains are not a subset of Lipschitz domains.",,"['functional-analysis', 'differential-geometry', 'partial-differential-equations', 'banach-spaces', 'sobolev-spaces']"

93,Solving equations where the solution is an operator,Solving equations where the solution is an operator,,"Ok, so here's some context. Solving regular equations we might have something like this: $2 + x = 5$, solving for $x$ we get 3. We might even have an equation like $x + y = 5$ where there are multiple solutions. But what's in common with all these equations is that the process, or the algorithm, we follow to solve them is determined by the operators that show the relations between variables. Now if you think back to very early elementary school, I'm sure you solved stuff like $5 \_ 2 = 3$ where you would fill in the blank with a minus. I'm wondering if there's a branch or mathematics that studies actual systematical ways to solve ""equations"" like that. It might seem trivial from this example but it obviously would grow in complexity. Perhaps the solutions would be operators AND numbers.
