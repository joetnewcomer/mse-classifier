8,Why do we assume principal root for the notation $\sqrt{}$,Why do we assume principal root for the notation,\sqrt{},"I'm wondering why when $n$ is even we always assume the positive root for $\sqrt[n]{}.$ For example, if we have $x = \sqrt{4}$ , we always assume $x = 2$ . Yet when we have $x^2 = 4,$ we write $x = \pm\sqrt{4} \Longrightarrow x = -2, 2$ . The problem is that if I take the 1st equation, and square both sides, I get $$x = \sqrt{4} \Longrightarrow x^2 = 4 \Longrightarrow x = \pm\sqrt{4} \Longrightarrow x = -2, 2$$ My teacher says that if you introduce the radical sign, use $\pm$ , but those two equations are the same under the rules about radicals she taught us, so the ""taking the positive root"" rule feels arbitrary to me. I get that people want to make the radical mean something without ambiguity, but making arbitrary rules, like taking just the positive answer, seems to confuse things and lead to inconsistency, like in the above. There are other examples, such as solving for $x$ , then substituting the original equation with the value of $x$ , and not getting it to work because you can only take the positive root. For things like the Pythagorean theorem, people like to say it's obvious to take the positive one only, but there are ways to represent the Pythagorean theorem without relying on human judgement to decipher the final answer.  Say you have a right triangle with legs $a=3$ , $b=4$ , and you want to find c.  So you do: $3^2 + 4^2 = c^2$ , $c > 0$ . and solve the systems of equations, just like any other: $c = \pm\sqrt{25} \Longrightarrow c = -5, 5$ . $c = -5, 5$ intersects $c > 0$ at $c = 5$ , so the answer is $c = 5$ .  I don't see why you would need to redefine square root: $\pm\sqrt{}$ to mean principal square root : $\sqrt{}$ to find the correct answer.

Let $x_{1}^{2} + x_{2}^{2} + x_{3}^{2}+\cdots+x_{n}^{2}=u.$ So, if $x_1\cdot x_2\cdot x_3 \cdots x_n = (-1)^n\frac{a_0}{a_n}$, then  $$x_1 =(-1)^n\frac{a_0}{(x_2\cdot x_3 \cdots x_n)a_n},$$ and  $$x_1^2 =(-1)^nx_1\frac{a_0}{(x_2\cdot x_3 \cdots x_n)a_n}.$$ So, $$\begin{align*} x_{1}^{2} &+ x_{2}^{2} +\cdots+x_{n}^{2}=u\\ &=(-1)^nx_1\frac{a_0}{(x_2\cdot x_3 \cdots x_n)a_n} + (-1)^nx_2\frac{a_0}{(x_1\cdot x_3 \cdots x_n)a_n} \\ &\qquad +\cdots+(-1)^nx_n\frac{a_0}{(x_1\cdot x_2 \cdots x_{n-1})a_n}. \end{align*}$$ It can be written as  $$(-1)^n\cdot \frac{a_0}{a_n}\left(\frac{x_1}{x_2\cdot x_3 \cdots x_n} + \frac{x_2}{x_1\cdot x_3 \cdots x_n} +\cdots+ \frac{x_n}{x_1\cdot x_2 \cdots x_{n-1}}\right) = u,$$ And I'm stuck here. That's my question. How can I write $u$ in function of the coefficients (or its impossibility)? Any help will be very appreciated. I'm young, and I do not have experience with proving things. That's all. Thank you.",,"['algebra-precalculus', 'polynomials']"

28,Algebraic Solution to $\cos(\pi x) + x^2 = 0$,Algebraic Solution to,\cos(\pi x) + x^2 = 0,"Today I was fiddling about with a TI-89 calculator, attempting as usual to confuse it. I figured that making it solve an equation with a periodic function would be fun, so I tried the following: $$\cos(\pi x) + x^2 = 0$$ While this didn't stump it, I noted that the solution it gave was just a decimal. Since I ran this through solve(), which usually will give you a nice solution like $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ if it can, I found this rather interesting. I figured what it eventually did was give up on solving it in its usual manner and move to a numeric method: i.e., it simply made intelligent guesses until it found good solutions. I am usually inclined to think most random decimals have a closed form expression behind them. (In fact, do all such decimals have a closed form, even if we don't know it? I may have to look into that.) As such, I decided to put this into Wolfram|Alpha and see if it had any better results . But no dice; it gave me back, similar to the TI-89, that $x = \pm 1$ and $x \approx \pm 0.629847$ were solutions. The latter decimal, $x \approx 0.629847$, is the one I am concerned with. As far as I am concerned, $x = \pm 1$ are sort of ""trivial"" solutions; just thinking the problem over leads you to them naturally. Is there a way to solve this algebraically? I can sort of narrow it down. I know that as $x \to \infty$, the $\cos(\pi x)$ term is essentially trivial compared to $x^2$. Given that $x^2>0$ for any $x \ne 0$, and given that $\cos(\pi x)$ has a range of $[-1, 1]$, it seems to me that whenever $x^2>1$, $\cos(\pi x)$ cannot pull down $x^2$ enough for it become zero. So, it seems natural to me to think, then, that all solutions must lie where $x^2 \le 1$, viz., within the interval $[-1, 1]$. This narrows down the field significantly, but it still does not really help me with an algebraic solution. (However, I figure if I were to come across this in a real-world scenario, this would be a useful line of attack for a guess-and-test sort of deal.) Another line of attack I attempted was to take the reverse approach: use the numerically attained solution to find a closed-form solution. I thought it may be an interesting number I simply had not learned about, so I tried to look up the decimal sequence in the OEIS, but to no luck: no such sequence was available. I've sort of rambled, so here are my questions: Is there an algebraic solution to the above equation? Even if there is not, is there any way to figure out the closed form expression behind the decimal $x = 0.629847$? I don't even care if the expression has $\cos$ or $\sin$ in it.

Here's a proof on the site 'zhihu', I've reposted it as community wiki. This proof is invalid because its lemma is wrong.

37,Mental $n-$th root of $N$,Mental th root of,n- N,"It has been a while since I started thinking about this problem: a fast method to evaluate (in an approximate way) mentally the $n-$th root of a number $N$. I'm talking about great numbers, because otherwise one could handle with the first terms of a Taylor series. I found time ago a really cute approximation for the square root, which runs like this: you have $N$, and you always can write $N$ as $$N = q^2 + s$$ Where $q^2$ is the nearest $N$ perfect square, and $s$ is the remainder. Trivial example: $50 = 49 + 1$. Thanks to that, one can approximate $$\sqrt{N} = \sqrt{q^2 \pm s} \approx q \pm \frac{s}{2q}$$ Fast example $$\sqrt{43} = \sqrt{36 + 7} \approx 6 + \frac{7}{12} = 6 + 0.58333 = 6.58333(..)$$ Where actually $$\sqrt{43} = 6.55743(...)$$ So somehow one may compute it mentally in a quite easy and fast way. The $n-$th problem I started then to think about if such a method could be generalized for some $n-$th square root. With intuition (and a lot of naiveness) I thought about a sort of ""mathematical symmetry"", something like $$\sqrt[n]{N} = \sqrt[n]{q^n \pm s} \approx q \pm \frac{s}{nq^{n-1}}$$ But I don't know if that may work in general. For example: $$\sqrt[4]{600} = \sqrt[4]{625 - 25} = \sqrt[4]{5^4 - 25} \approx 5 - \frac{25}{4\cdot 5^{4-1}} = 5 - 0.05 = 4.95$$ And surprisingly $$4.95^4 = 600.3725(...)$$ BUT if we mind with the plus sign... $$\sqrt[4]{600} = \sqrt[4]{256 + 344} = \sqrt[4]{4^4 + 344} \approx 4 + \frac{344}{4\cdot 4^3} = 1.34375 = 5.34375$$ Where $$5.34375^4 = 815.4259(...)$$ So it seems like it works if we pick the correct sign namely when the remainder $s$ is quite small.

40,What is the reason behind the Pythagorean relation in a hyperbola?,What is the reason behind the Pythagorean relation in a hyperbola?,,"I am currently (in my Pre-Calculus course) deriving the equations of the conic sections. I very much understand how the relationship, in an ellipse , between $a, b$, and $c$ is established.

Seeing this fact, I set the distance from $(0, b)$ to $(c, 0)$ equal to the distance from $(a, 0)$ to $(c, 0)$ and, through algebra, arrived at the Pythagorean relationship $b^2=a^2-c^2$.

Given a polynomial how to determine $n$ where the $n-th$ root of this polynomial is a polynomial and how to determine the $n-$ th root of this polynomial? There is Taylor theorem or the extended binomial theorem that can find $(P(x))^{1/n}$ but this is not what I am looking for because It only deals with two terms and the more terms that a polynomial have the more one needs to use the binomial theorem on each term which gets very ugly. It gives an infinite series which doesn't tell if each the $n-$ th root is a polynomial or not Even if one can make simplifications on the  infinite series to conclude it is a polynomial finding suitable $n$ would need one to check all the cases from $2-m$ where $m$ is the degree of polynomial, which is not very effective.","I was this problem: I solved this question because I just knew that but this made me wonder is there is a way to know if the th root of a certain polynomial is a polynomial?
