1,Uniform convergence: $\sum \frac{x^2}{(1 + x^2)^n}$,Uniform convergence:,\sum \frac{x^2}{(1 + x^2)^n},"Consider the series of functions: $$\sum_{n \ge 1} \frac{x^2}{(1 + x^2)^n}$$ Q: Where does this series converge uniformly?

Since $y_{2n}$ converges to $y$ there exists an index $2N$ such that $d(y_{2n},y) < \varepsilon$ for $2n \geq 2N$, and since $(y_{2n+1})$ converges to $y$ there exists $2M + 1$ such that $d(y_{2n+1}, y) < \varepsilon$ for $2n + 1 \geq 2M + 1$.

And, $2-$ If ${\{{a_n}^2}\}$ converges to $a^2$, to which of $a$ or $-a$ does ${\{a_n}\}$ converge? Thank you.","From Fitzpatrick's Advanced Calculus book: ""Suppose that the sequence ${\{a_n}\}$ is monotone, i.e., either monotonically increasing or decreasing. Prove that ${\{a_n}\}$ converges if and only if ${\{{a_n}^2}\}$ converges. Show that this result does not hold without the monotonicity assumption."" It is easy to show to that ${\{{a_n}^2}\}$ converges if ${\{a_n}\}$ converges: ${\{a_n}\}$ is convergent sequence and ${\{a_n}\}$ also, since product of two convergent sequences converges (to the product of their limit), so ${\{{a_n}^2}\}={\{a_n\times a_n}\}$ converges; and it doesn't require that ${\{a_n}\}$ to be monotone. On the other hand, it is not general true to say that ${\{a_n}\}$ converges if ${\{{a_n}}^2\}$ converges; ${\{a_n}\}={\{(-1)^n}\}$ is a counterexample. What remains to evaluate (i.e., my questions) is that: $1-$ Prove that if ${\{{a_n}^2}\}$ converges and if ${\{a_n}\}$ is monotone, thus ${\{a_n}\}$ converges.

What about $e$, $\sqrt{2}$ or some other commonly known irrational numbers? Is this property of numbers independent of base?  If a number has this property when written in base $10$, will it also have it in base $2$, $3$ and all other bases?",,"['sequences-and-series', 'pi', 'decimal-expansion']"
