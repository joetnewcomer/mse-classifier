18,Why the unitary group is not a complex algebraic variety?,Why the unitary group is not a complex algebraic variety?,,"The question comes from Exercise 1.1.2 of the book ""An Invitation to Algebraic Geometry"". By definition the unitary group U(n) is the group of all complex matrix that satisfies $U^*U=I$. I know that since conjugate is involved the definition equations are not complex polynomials. But this doesn't answer the question. To answer the question we have to prove that ""there does not exist a set of polynomials whose common zero set is U(n)"". For odd n I have an idea: since the real dimension of U(n) is $n^2$, when n is odd it cannot be a complex variety whose real dimension should always be even(am I right here?). But what if n is even? Any hints will be appreciated. ============ I think I've got the idea of @orangeskid answer. Let me edit the post and make it more detailed, so that others can understand. First let's state 3 lemmas: Lemma 1 . Given an analytic function $f$ on $\mathbb{C}^n$, and suppose $W$ is a $n$ (real) dimensional linear subspace of $\mathbb{C}^n$ such that $\mathbb{C}^n\cong W+iW$, if $\left.f\right |_W\equiv 0$, then $f\equiv 0$. Lemma 2 . The Lie algebra $W=u(n)\subset \mathbb{C}^{n^2}$ of the Lie group $U(n)\subset GL(n,\mathbb{C})$ has a real dimension of $n^2$, and has the property that $\mathbb{C}^{n^2}\cong W+iW$. Lemma 3 . Given an analytic function $g: GL(n,\mathbb{C})\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ that vanishes on $U(n)$, the exponential map exp transplants it to an analytic function $f=g\circ \exp: \mathbb{C}^{n^2}\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ that vanishes on $u(n)$. Once we have the 3 lemmas, it's easy: Suppose $g: \mathbb{C}^{n^2}\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ is a polynomial vanishing on $U(n)$. Based on Lemma 3 we get an analytic function $f=g\circ \exp: \mathbb{C}^{n^2}\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ vanishing on $u(n)$, so according to Lemma 1 and 2 we have $f\equiv 0$, which implies $g\equiv0$ on $\exp(\mathbb{C}^{n^2})=GL(n,\mathbb{C})$. Q.E.D. So we need only to prove the lemmas. Proof of Lemma 1 : Identifying $\mathbb{C}^n$ as $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$, choose an orthonormal basis $\{e_1, e_2, \dots, e_n \}$ of $W$. Then $\{e_1, \operatorname{J}(e_1), \dots, e_n, \operatorname{J}(e_n)\}$ is an orthonormal basis of $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$, where $\operatorname{J}$ is the almost complex structure of $\mathbb{C}^n$. Do a coordinate transformation so that these basis become the (real)coordinate basis of the coordinate $\{z_1, \dots, z_n\}=\{x^1+iy^1, \dots, x^n+iy^n\}$ and the conclusion reduces to the following one: If the analytic function $f: \mathbb{C}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ vanishes on the real coordinates, that is, $f(x^1, \dots, x^n)\equiv 0$, then $f(z_1, \dots, z_n)\equiv 0$. $\forall x^2, \dots, x^n$, let $g(z)=f(z, x^2, \dots, x^n)$, $g$ is analytic and $g(x)=f(x, x^2, \dots, x^n)\equiv 0, \forall x\in \mathbb{R}$. So $g\equiv 0$, that is, $f(z_1, x^2, \dots, x^n)\equiv 0, \forall z_1\in\mathbb{C}, x^i\in\mathbb{R}, i=2, \dots, n$. Continue the process we'll get $f(z_1, z_2, \dots, z_n)\equiv 0$. Q.E.D. Proof of Lemma 2 : $u(n)$ is the group of all n × n skew-Hermitian matrices, having a real dimension of $n^2$. For any n × n complex matrix A, Write A as $$A=\frac{A-A^*}{2} + i\cdot(-i)\frac{A+A^*}{2}$$. Q.E.D. Proof of Lemma 3 : This is trivial since exp is analytic. Q.E.D.","The question comes from Exercise 1.1.2 of the book ""An Invitation to Algebraic Geometry"". By definition the unitary group U(n) is the group of all complex matrix that satisfies $U^*U=I$. I know that since conjugate is involved the definition equations are not complex polynomials. But this doesn't answer the question. To answer the question we have to prove that ""there does not exist a set of polynomials whose common zero set is U(n)"". For odd n I have an idea: since the real dimension of U(n) is $n^2$, when n is odd it cannot be a complex variety whose real dimension should always be even(am I right here?). But what if n is even? Any hints will be appreciated. ============ I think I've got the idea of @orangeskid answer. Let me edit the post and make it more detailed, so that others can understand. First let's state 3 lemmas: Lemma 1 . Given an analytic function $f$ on $\mathbb{C}^n$, and suppose $W$ is a $n$ (real) dimensional linear subspace of $\mathbb{C}^n$ such that $\mathbb{C}^n\cong W+iW$, if $\left.f\right |_W\equiv 0$, then $f\equiv 0$. Lemma 2 . The Lie algebra $W=u(n)\subset \mathbb{C}^{n^2}$ of the Lie group $U(n)\subset GL(n,\mathbb{C})$ has a real dimension of $n^2$, and has the property that $\mathbb{C}^{n^2}\cong W+iW$. Lemma 3 . Given an analytic function $g: GL(n,\mathbb{C})\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ that vanishes on $U(n)$, the exponential map exp transplants it to an analytic function $f=g\circ \exp: \mathbb{C}^{n^2}\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ that vanishes on $u(n)$. Once we have the 3 lemmas, it's easy: Suppose $g: \mathbb{C}^{n^2}\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ is a polynomial vanishing on $U(n)$. Based on Lemma 3 we get an analytic function $f=g\circ \exp: \mathbb{C}^{n^2}\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ vanishing on $u(n)$, so according to Lemma 1 and 2 we have $f\equiv 0$, which implies $g\equiv0$ on $\exp(\mathbb{C}^{n^2})=GL(n,\mathbb{C})$. Q.E.D. So we need only to prove the lemmas. Proof of Lemma 1 : Identifying $\mathbb{C}^n$ as $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$, choose an orthonormal basis $\{e_1, e_2, \dots, e_n \}$ of $W$. Then $\{e_1, \operatorname{J}(e_1), \dots, e_n, \operatorname{J}(e_n)\}$ is an orthonormal basis of $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$, where $\operatorname{J}$ is the almost complex structure of $\mathbb{C}^n$. Do a coordinate transformation so that these basis become the (real)coordinate basis of the coordinate $\{z_1, \dots, z_n\}=\{x^1+iy^1, \dots, x^n+iy^n\}$ and the conclusion reduces to the following one: If the analytic function $f: \mathbb{C}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ vanishes on the real coordinates, that is, $f(x^1, \dots, x^n)\equiv 0$, then $f(z_1, \dots, z_n)\equiv 0$. $\forall x^2, \dots, x^n$, let $g(z)=f(z, x^2, \dots, x^n)$, $g$ is analytic and $g(x)=f(x, x^2, \dots, x^n)\equiv 0, \forall x\in \mathbb{R}$. So $g\equiv 0$, that is, $f(z_1, x^2, \dots, x^n)\equiv 0, \forall z_1\in\mathbb{C}, x^i\in\mathbb{R}, i=2, \dots, n$. Continue the process we'll get $f(z_1, z_2, \dots, z_n)\equiv 0$. Q.E.D. Proof of Lemma 2 : $u(n)$ is the group of all n × n skew-Hermitian matrices, having a real dimension of $n^2$. For any n × n complex matrix A, Write A as $$A=\frac{A-A^*}{2} + i\cdot(-i)\frac{A+A^*}{2}$$. Q.E.D. Proof of Lemma 3 : This is trivial since exp is analytic. Q.E.D.",,['algebraic-geometry']

33,Computing the Zariski cotangent space,Computing the Zariski cotangent space,,"I'm an extreme beginner with algebraic geometry and am trying to get used to things. Say I have some (algebraically closed) field $k$, in $k^2$ I want to compute the Zariski cotangent space, let's say of something simple, $V(Y-X^2)$, at the origin. The definition I have is that it is the quotient $\mathfrak{m}_{(0,0),V}/\mathfrak{m}_{(0,0),V}^2$ where $\mathfrak{m}_{(0,0),V}$ is the unique maximal ideal (consisting of rational functions which vanish at the origin) of the local ring of $V$ at $(0,0)$, $\mathcal{O}_{(0,0),V}$ (consisting of those rational functions that are defined at the origin). I'd like to do the computation directly using this definition (rather than the multivariable calculus way I've been seeing more often). So to get this I first think about what $\mathcal{O}_{(0,0),V}$ looks like. This will be the rational functions which are (equivalent to a) quotient of polynomials modulo $(Y-X^2)$, say $g(X,Y) + (Y-X^2)$ and $f(X,Y) + (Y-X^2)$ where the latter is the denominator, such that $f(0,0) + (Y-X^2) \neq 0$ in $k[X,Y]/(Y-X^2)$ which is the same as saying $f(0,0) \neq 0$ in $k$, so we're looking at quotients where the constant term of $f$ is non-zero. Now for $\mathfrak{m}_{(0,0),V}$. Here by similar reasoning we're looking for quotients where the numerator polynomial has zero constant term and the denominator polynomial has non-zero constant term as before. I can't see any nice descriptions coming here, nice enough for me to compute the quotient $\mathfrak{m}_{(0,0),V}/\mathfrak{m}_{(0,0),V}^2$. I can see that the coordinate ring $k[X,Y]/(Y-X^2)$ is isomorphic to $k[X]$ and so by passing to there perhaps things would simplify but doing this I get the exact same things as before except now the polynomials are in just the one variable.

43,Modules over a functor of points,Modules over a functor of points,,"I have a question on the ''functor of points''-approach to schemes and $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules. Please let me first write up a defintion. Let $Psh$ denote the category of presheaves on the opposite category of rings $Rng^{op}$. So $Psh$ is the category of functors from the category of rings $Rng$ to the category $Set$ of sets. Fix an $X\in Psh$. Demazure and Gabriel define in their book ''Introduction to Algebraic Geometry and Algebraic Groups"" (page 58, I.2.4.1) an $X$-module $M$ to be an object $M\in Psh$ and a morphism $f:M\to    X$ in $Psh$ (a natural transformation $f:M\to X$, that's what they call an $X$-functor) such that for every ring $R$ and every map $p:*\to    X(R)$ the set $M(R,p):=*\times_{X(R)}M(R)$ has an $R$-module structure with the property that for any ring map $\phi:R\to S$ the induced map $\psi:M(R,p)\to M(S,\phi(p))$ is additive and satisfies \begin{equation} \psi(\lambda m)= \phi(\lambda)\psi(m) \end{equation} for all $m\in M(R,p)$ and $\lambda\in R$. They call $M$ quasicoherent if for any ring map $\phi:R\to S$, the induced map \begin{equation} M(R,p)\otimes_R S\cong M(S,\phi(p))    \end{equation} is an isomorphism. I want to understand an $X$-module $M$ as a morphism $f:M\to X$ in $Psh$ for which some conditions are required to hold ''locally'', like a bundle, but let me more precise in what I mean: The map $p$ in the definition above corresponds by the Yoneda lemma to a map $p:R\to X$ (Here, I use the same notion for $R$ and its associated presheaf $\hom(R,-)$). Let the object $M_p'$ of $Psh$ be defined by the cartesian diagram \begin{eqnarray} M_p'&\to & M\\ \downarrow && \downarrow f\\ R&\xrightarrow{p} & X \end{eqnarray} in $Psh$. I want to formulate conditions on $M_p'$ (and not on $M(R,p)=*\times_{X(R)}M(R)$ as above) such that $M$ is an $X$-module. The set $M(R,p)$ is contained in the set $M_p'(R)$ but there are not equal, unfortunately. My question is thus: What are the conditions on the $M_p'$ such that $M$ (together with $f$) defines an $X$-module? How is quasicoherence defined in this situation?

Please let me first write up a defintion. Let $Psh$ denote the category of presheaves on the opposite category of rings $Rng^{op}$. So $Psh$ is the category of functors from the category of rings $Rng$ to the category $Set$ of sets. Fix an $X\in Psh$. Demazure and Gabriel define in their book ''Introduction to Algebraic Geometry and Algebraic Groups"" (page 58, I.2.4.1) an $X$-module $M$ to be an object $M\in Psh$ and a morphism $f:M\to    X$ in $Psh$ (a natural transformation $f:M\to X$, that's what they call an $X$-functor) such that for every ring $R$ and every map $p:*\to    X(R)$ the set $M(R,p):=*\times_{X(R)}M(R)$ has an $R$-module structure with the property that for any ring map $\phi:R\to S$ the induced map $\psi:M(R,p)\to M(S,\phi(p))$ is additive and satisfies \begin{equation} \psi(\lambda m)= \phi(\lambda)\psi(m) \end{equation} for all $m\in M(R,p)$ and $\lambda\in R$. They call $M$ quasicoherent if for any ring map $\phi:R\to S$, the induced map \begin{equation} M(R,p)\otimes_R S\cong M(S,\phi(p))    \end{equation} is an isomorphism. I want to understand an $X$-module $M$ as a morphism $f:M\to X$ in $Psh$ for which some conditions are required to hold ''locally'', like a bundle, but let me more precise in what I mean: The map $p$ in the definition above corresponds by the Yoneda lemma to a map $p:R\to X$ (Here, I use the same notion for $R$ and its associated presheaf $\hom(R,-)$). Let the object $M_p'$ of $Psh$ be defined by the cartesian diagram \begin{eqnarray} M_p'&\to & M\\ \downarrow && \downarrow f\\ R&\xrightarrow{p} & X \end{eqnarray} in $Psh$. I want to formulate conditions on $M_p'$ (and not on $M(R,p)=*\times_{X(R)}M(R)$ as above) such that $M$ is an $X$-module. The set $M(R,p)$ is contained in the set $M_p'(R)$ but there are not equal, unfortunately. My question is thus: What are the conditions on the $M_p'$ such that $M$ (together with $f$) defines an $X$-module? How is quasicoherence defined in this situation? To be more precise, I would like the above definition of a quasicoherent $X$-module to be the same as something like this: An object $M\in Psh$ and a morphism $f:M\to    X$ in $Psh$ such that for every ring $R$ and every map $p:R\to    X$ the set $M_p'(R)=(R \times_X M)(R)$ has an $R$-module structure with the property that for any ring map $\phi:R\to S$ the induced map $\psi'(R):M_p'(R)\to M_{\phi(p)}'(R)$ is additive and satisfies $\psi'(R)(\lambda m)= \phi(\lambda)\psi'(R)(m)$ for all $m\in M_p'(R)$ and $\lambda\in R$ and $M_p'(R)\otimes_R S\cong M_{\phi(p)}'(S)$ is an isomorphism.

44,What does this notion of scheme morphism mean?,What does this notion of scheme morphism mean?,,"I apologize for the naivety of this question but I am a beginner in algebraic geometry. Moreover, I realized that the initial question (quoted at the end) was not formulated very clearly. Hopefully, I can do better now involving the things learned from  Zhen Lin's comments. One sometimes sees morphism of affine or projective schemes over a base field defined by some kind of coordinate notation, e.g. \begin{equation} f:\mathbb{A^2}\to \mathbb{A^3}, (a,b)\mapsto (a^2+b,b^2-2,4)\hspace{20pt} (*) \end{equation} but formally a morphism of schemes is a priori a pair consisting of a map $f:\mathbb{A^2}\to \mathbb{A^3}$ of topological spaces and a morphism $f^\sharp:\mathcal{O_{\mathbb{A^3}}}\to f_*\mathcal{O_{\mathbb{A^2}}}$ of structure sheaves. As Zhen Lin explains in the comments, the map of topological spaces $f$ is determined by what is does on the maximal ideals of $\mathbb{A}^2$ . If the base field is algebraically closed, these maximal ideals are of the form $(x_1-a,x_2-b)$ by the Hilbert nullstellensatz. Hence, in this case it suffices to specify an image for the pairs $(a,b)$ to get the topological morphism. I have (still) two problems with this notion. Firstly , why exactly does such an assignment $(a,b)\mapsto (f_1(a,b),f_2(a,b),f_3(a,b))$ lead to a morphism of schemes and not only of topological spaces? I guess, the thing is that the $f_i$ are given by polynomials and not by arbitrary functions $k^2\to k$ . Let me please look at a concrete example to see how this works. Consider $f:Spec~k[x]\to Spec~k[y]$ and the assignment $a\mapsto a^2-1$ . To construct a map of the structure sheaves, I have to build a $k$ -algebra map $\tilde f:k[y]\to k[x]$ such that the pre-image of the ideal $(x-a)$ is the ideal $(y-(a^2-1))$ . Is it correct to set $y\mapsto a^2-a-1$ and is it obvious that one finds such a $k$ -algebra morphism for the ''higher dimensional'' analogues like $\bar f:k[y_1,y_2,y_3]\to k[x_1,x_2]$ ?

In it, he shows that if $k$ is a field and $X=k[T_1,\dots,T_n]/I$ is an affine scheme over $k$, the sections $X(k)$ (the $k$-rational points of $X$) are in bijection with the algebraic set $Z(I)$ cut out by $I$. This is the set of all $\alpha\in k^n$ with $P(\alpha)=0$ for every $P(T)\in I$.

The proof in the example makes essential use of the fact that $k$ is a field. Clearly we want to consider the set cut out by $I$ over $R^n$, where $R$ is some ring, and relate this to the sections $X(R)$, but I do not see how to proceed. In particular, the proof identified the $k$-rational points with the points where the residue field was $k$. Since the residue field is always a field, but $R$ may not be, we can no longer use the residue field to identify the $R$-rational points.","On page 49 of Liu's Algebraic Geometry and Arithmetic Curves , we find Example 3.32.

Let $\pi:E\to X$ be a vector bundle on a variety $X$ and $f:Y\to X$ a morphism. We have a bundle $\pi':f^\ast E\to Y$, the pullback of $E$. If we have a section $\sigma:X\to E$, which means $\pi\circ\sigma=1_X$, then I read in several places that I can pull-back this section by pre-composing it with $f$, and this gives me a section of $f^\ast E$. It seems to me that I only get an arrow $Y\to E$. So why do we call $\sigma':=\sigma\circ f$ a section of $\pi'$? My thoughts: call $g$ the morphism $f^\ast E\to E$. Perhaps the above means that if we start with some $y\in Y$ and we take any $z\in g^{-1}(\sigma'(y))$, then we have that $\pi'(z)=y$. Is this correct? In any case, I can only prove that $f(\pi'(z))=f(y)$, which doesn't imply $\pi'(z)=y$. However I feel like I'm really missing the point here.
