I have tried using the Ansatz method and the generating function method in the following way: Ansatz method First, for the homogenous part, $a_n = a_{n-1} + 2a_{n-2}$, I guess $a_n = \lambda^n$ as the solution, and substituting and solving for the quadratic, I get $\lambda = -1, 2$. So, $a_n = \alpha (-1)^n + \beta 2^n$. Then, for the inhomogenous part, I guess $a_n = \gamma 2^n$, to get $\gamma 2^n = \gamma 2^{n-1} + 2\gamma 2^{n-2} + 2^n$, whence $2^n=0$, which means, I suppose, that this guess is not valid. These are the kind of guesses that usually work, so I don't know why it fails in this particular case, and what to do otherwise, so I tried the generating function method. Generating function method Let $$ A(z) = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} a_k z^k $$ be the generating function for the sequence $\{ a_n \}_{n \in \mathbb{N} \cup {0}}$. Then, I try to write down the recursive relation in terms of $A(z)$: $$ A(z) = zA(z) + 2z^2 A(z) + \frac{1}{1-2z} + (1 - 2z), $$ where the last term in the brackets arises because of the given initial conditions. Then, solving for $A(z)$, $$ \begin{align} A(z) &= \frac{1}{(1+z)(1-2z)^2} + \frac{1}{1+z}\\ &= \frac{2}{9}\frac{1}{1-2z} + \frac{2}{3}\frac{1}{(1-2z)^2} + \frac{10}{9}\frac{1}{1+z}\\ &=\frac{2}{9} \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} 2^k z^k + \frac{2}{3} \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (k+1)2^k z^k + \frac{10}{9} \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (-1)^k z^k\\ &= \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{(3k+4)2^{k+1} + (-1)^k 10}{9} z^k. \end{align} $$ So, $$ a_k = \frac{(3k+4)2^{k+1} + (-1)^k 10}{9}. $$ But then, $a_1 = 2$, whereas we started out with $a_1 = 1$. At first, I thought that maybe the generating function method did not work because some of the series on the right hand side were not converging, but they all look like they're converging for $|z| < 1/2$.

One example I cannot resolve. First I assume the sequence of binomialcoefficients $ \{ b_k = \binom k2 \}_{k=2\to\infty}=\{1,3,6,10,15,...\}$ Then to assign a meaningful value to the alternating sum $ S= 1-3+6+10.... $ I compute the Abel-sum $ \qquad S = \lim_{x \to 1} 1-3x+6x^2-10x^3+...-... = {1 \over (1+x)^3 } = 1/8 $ (Abel) But I want to proceed one more step. The sequence of partial sums may be denoted as $ \{ c_k \}_{k=0\to\infty}=\{1,-2,4,-6,9,-12,16,-20,...\} $ Q - my question is : what is the sum $ T = 1-2+4-6+9... $ ? I tried two approaches, but I'm lost. The generating function is simply $ 1/(1+x)^3/(1-x) $ but here I cannot let x approach 1, so the simple application of the Abel-sum is impossible. Also the Euler-sum seems to not to converge; instead I get increasing partial sums like k/16 for the k'th partial sum . On the other hand, I observe, that the coefficients are near the squares, so if I consider the alternating $\zeta$ (usually called Dirichlet-$\eta$) $ \qquad \qquad \begin{eqnarray} X &=& 1 - 2.25 + 4 - 6.25 + 9 - 12.25 + ...  \\ &=&( 4 - 9 + 16 - 25 + ... - ...)/4 \\ &=& (1-\eta(-2))/4 \\ &=& (1-0)/4 = {1 \over 4} \end{eqnarray}$ then in T I had just each second coefficient $1/4$ above that of the $\eta$-series in X and possibly could go along something like $ \qquad \qquad \begin{eqnarray} T &=& 1 - (2.25-0.25) + 4 - (6.25-0.25) + ... - ... \\ &=& X + 0.25*\zeta(0) \\ &=& X-1/8 = {1 \over 8} \end{eqnarray}$ But surely this is only an outline how I could come nearer to a solution. How could I actually proceed here? [update]: One more idea was to make use of reordering summation.

So, $-\dfrac{1}{2}$ is a fixed point of the sequence.

Since this problem was much more math than chemistry, though, you actually end up with an infinite sum! (The original phrasing of the problem involved adding infinite acids to a bottle.) The equation I arrived at was this: $$[H^+]=\sum^{\infty}_{i=1}\frac{1\times 10^{-6}\cdot 0.5^i}{i[H^+]+1\times 10^{-6}}.$$ I tested the value of the RHS for several guesses of $[H^+]$ using the first 10 terms (notably, this was on a TI calculator with 2 lines of LCD display.) Most telling was a sum of $6.93 \times 10^{-4}$ for $[H^+]=1 \times 10^{-3}.$ Thus, I conjectured that the RHS simplified to $\ln{(2)}\cdot 1\times 10^{-6}/[H^+].$ From there, solving the equation was trivial (no iteration needed, thank god.)

54,Geometric-Harmonic Mean,Geometric-Harmonic Mean,,"Context: Recently, I got interested in the Arithmetic-Geometric mean $\mathrm{AGM}(x,y)$ because it had the surprising property that $$\int_0^{\pi/2}\frac{dt}{\sqrt{x^2\cos^2t+y^2\sin^2t}}=\frac{\pi}{2\mathrm{AGM}(x,y)}.$$ I say this is surprising because it has such a complicated definition: If the sequences $(a_n)$ and $(g_n)$ are defined by $$\begin{align} a_{n+1}&=\tfrac12(a_n+g_n) &a_0&=x\\ g_{n+1}&=\sqrt{a_n g_n} &g_0&=y \end{align}$$ then $$\mathrm{AGM}(x,y):=\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n\ .$$ After I messed around with $\mathrm{AGM}$ and was able to prove its relation to the above elliptic integral, I asked myself the question ""is there an artihmetic-harmonic mean?"" The answer: yes. The Arithmetic-Harmonic Mean: We define the sequences $$\begin{align} a_{n+1}&=\tfrac{1}{2}(a_n+h_n)  &a_0&=x\\ h_{n+1}&=\frac2{\frac1{a_n}+\frac1{h_n}}  &h_0&=y \end{align}$$ and the Arithmetic-Harmonic mean is then defined as $$\mathrm{AHM}(x,y):=\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n\ .$$ Amazingly enough, we are able to find a closed-form evaluation for $\mathrm{AHM}(x,y)$ assuming $x,y>0$ . We do so by noticing that $$h_{n+1}=\frac{2a_nh_n}{a_n+h_n}=\frac{a_nh_n}{a_{n+1}}$$ so that $$a_nh_n=a_{n-1}h_{n-1}=a_0h_0=xy$$ giving $$a_{n+1}=\frac12\left(a_n+\frac{xy}{a_n}\right)$$ which converges to $$\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n=\mathrm{AHM}(x,y)=\sqrt{xy}\ .$$ That being established, I wanted to know if there is a geometric-harmonic mean. The Geometric-Harmonic Mean: I first should define it. Let the sequences $(h_n)$ and $(g_n)$ be defined as $$\begin{align} h_{n+1}&=\frac{2}{\frac1{h_n}+\frac1{g_n}} &h_0&=x\\ g_{n+1}&=\sqrt{h_n g_n}  &g_0&=y \end{align}$$ then, assuming convergence, define $$\mathrm{GHM}(x,y):=\lim_{n\to\infty}h_n\ .$$ It seems as if it will be harder to find out things about $\mathrm{GHM}$ because I cannot seem to sufficiently simplify the relationship between the two sequences as I was able to with $\mathrm{AHM}$ . I feel though, that there may be a really interesting integral relationship here. I did a little investigation of my own. One notable value of $\mathrm{AGM}$ is Gauss's Constant: $$\mathbf{g}=\mathrm{AGM}(1,\sqrt2)=\frac{(2\pi)^{3/2}}{\Gamma^2(\tfrac14)}.$$ I found $h_4$ and $g_4$ for $h_0=1$ , $g_0=\sqrt{2}$ on Desmos : $$h_4\approx g_4\approx 1.18034059902$$ for which Wolfram suggests the closed form $$1.18034059902\approx \sqrt{2}\,\mathbf{g}$$ which is definitely very fishy...
