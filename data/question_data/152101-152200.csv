2,Equivalence of Rudin's Definition 4.33 (infinite limits and limits at infinity)?,Equivalence of Rudin's Definition 4.33 (infinite limits and limits at infinity)?,,"In Rudin's ""Principles of Mathematical Analysis"", Definition 4.33 (p98) states: Definition 4.33 $\quad$ Let $f$ be a real function defined on $E.$  We say that $f(t)\to A$ as $t\to x$, where $A$ and $x$ are in the extended real number system, if for every neighborhood $U$ of $A$ there is a neighborhood $V$ of $x$ such that $V \cap E$ is not empty, and such that $f(t)\in U$ for all $t\in V\cap E, t\ne x.$ I'm a little confused however by the remark right beneath this definition: A moment's consideration will show that this coincides with Definition 4.1 when $A$ and $x$ are real. My question is actually three-fold: 1) In Definition 4.1 (quoted below), it is explicitly stated that $x$ ($p$) has to be a limit point of $E$.  Can this be inferred from Definition 4.33?  It appears to me that according to Definition 4.33 the limit of a function can also be defined even if $x$ is an isolated point of $E.$  For example, let $E=\{0\}\cup \{1\} \cup [3,4]$, and $f(0)=f(1)=0, f(t)=t, t\in [3,4]$.  Then with $V$ being a neighborhood of radius $2$ around $0$, we have $f(t)\to 0$, as $t\to 0,$ don't we? 2) Similarly, for limits at infinity, i.e. $x=\infty$, Definition 4.33 doesn't require the domain $E$ of $f$ to be unbounded, does it?  For example, if $f(x)=1$ for $x\in[0,1]$, then we may also say $f(x)\to 1$ as $x\to \infty$? (e.g. with $V=(0.5, \infty)$ we clearly satisfy Definition 4.33.) 3) Should we or should we not add these assumptions (or implicitly assume them) when using Definition 4.33?

One of the simplest is a dipole, which requires two pieces of wire. The total length of these is given by the formula: Total length (in metres) = $143$ / Frequency (in MHz) You then divide this number by two (and usually add a bit for safety as it's easier to cut wire off the end than add more) and cut your wires. $143$ is a ""standard constant"". In the real world, this number varies due to a variety of factors and has to be measured by experimentation. Essentially by raising and lowering the antenna, cutting a bit off each time. It's really quite time-consuming. Here's the problem I'd like to solve: My measuring instruments are limited to a ruler and a metre stick. So I can measure long distances (metres) with poor accuracy, and short distances (up to $60$ cm) with good accuracy. In other words, if I've cut a wire to $14.2$m, it's probably $15$ or $14.7$ or something (but both wires will be equal because I've used one to cut the other). Conversely, if I've cut $15$cm off the end of a wire, I know that I've cut $15$cm off, and that it's accurate, because it's a single measurement. Here's the problem I'd like to solve: Let's say I have a magical instrument which tells me the frequency of my antenna (this is a real thing: it's called an antenna analyser). This tells my that my antenna works at $F1$. I don't know what the length truly is, so $L1$ is unknown. Now I cut a known length of wire off the end of each leg of my antenna (it has to be symmetrical). Let's say $15$cm. Now I have a new, higher, resonant frequency measurement, $F2$. Knowing $F1$, $F2$ and the change in length, is it possible to calculate the value of the ""constant"" $143$, to get a better idea what my next change in length should be? In actuality, the length starts out as (L + n), then changes to (L + n - c); where L = the 'wanted' length, n is an unknown offset, and c is the amount we cut off (which we know because we measured it accurately). My goal here is to go from time-consuming ""successive approximation"" to a method which allows the antenna to be raised and lowered an absolute minimum number of times. Is this possible?

For the definition of a set $E$ being open in a metric space $(X,d)$, we mean that for every $a\in E$, there exists a ball $B(a,r)=\{x\in X|d(x,a)<r\}$ such that $B(a,r)\subseteq E$. Notice that the ball in the definition is with respect to $(X,d)$ (the ball centered at point $a$ and consist of all point in $X$ such that $d(x,a)<r$), it is quite important.

Now, using the convexity of $g_{i+1}$ in $(0,2R)$ , I obtain: $$\dfrac{g_{i+1}(w_{i+1})-g_{i+1}(z_{i+1})}{w_{i+1}-z_{i+1}}\leq \dfrac{g_{i+1}(2R)-g_{i+1}(z_{i+1})}{2R-z_{i+1}}\leq \dfrac{{\rm osc}(g_{i+1}, (0,2R))}{R}:=c_i(R),$$ where ${\rm osc}(f,S)={\rm sup}\{|f(t)-f(s)|\ {\rm with}\: s,t\in S\}$ .

33,Theorem 3.55 in Baby Rudin: Every re-arrangement of an absolutely convergent series converges to the same sum in every normed space?,Theorem 3.55 in Baby Rudin: Every re-arrangement of an absolutely convergent series converges to the same sum in every normed space?,,"Here's Theorem 3.55 in the book Principles of Mathematical Analysis by Walter Rudin, third edition. If $\sum a_n$ is a series of complex numbers which converges absolutely, then every rearrangement of $\sum a_n$ converges, and they all converge to the same sum. And, here's Rudin's proof. Let $\sum a_n^\prime$ be a rearrangement, with partial sums $s_n^\prime$. Given $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists an integer $N$ such that $m \geq n \geq N$ implies $$\mbox{ (26) } \ \ \ \ \sum_{i=n}^m \vert a_i \vert \leq  \varepsilon.$$ Now choose $p$ such that the integers $1, 2, \ldots, N$ are all contained in the set $k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_p$. [Here $\{k_n\}$ is a sequence of positive integers in which every positive integer appears as a term once and only once, and $a_n^\prime = a_{k_n}$ for each $n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$; moreover, $s_n^\prime = a_1^\prime + \cdots + a_n^\prime$. This is the notation of  Definition 3.52 in Rudin. ] Then if $n > p$, the $a_1, \ldots, a_N$ will cancel in the difference $s_n - s_n^\prime$, so that $\vert s_n - s_n^\prime \vert \leq \varepsilon$ by (26). Hence $\{s_n^\prime \}$ converges to the same sum as $\{s_n \}$. Now here is my reading of Rudin's proof. As $\sum a_n$ converges absolutely, the series $\sum \vert a_n \vert$ converges, which means that the sequence $\{ \sum_{i =1}^n \vert a_i \vert \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is convergent and therefore Cauchy. Thus, given a real number $\varepsilon > 0$, we can find a natural number $N$ such that $$ \left\vert \sum_{i=1}^n \vert a_i \vert - \sum_{i=1}^m \vert a_i \vert \right\vert < \varepsilon \ \mbox{ for all } \ m, n \in \mathbb{N} \ \mbox{ such that } \ n \geq m >  N.$$ That is, $$ \sum_{i = m+1}^n \vert a_i \vert < \varepsilon \  \mbox{ for all } \ m, n \in \mathbb{N} \ \mbox{ such that } \ n \geq m >  N.$$ Now let $\{k_n \}$ be a sequence of natural numbers in which every natural number appears exactly once, and let $a_n^\prime = a_{k_n}$, and then let $s_n^\prime = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i^\prime$ for each $n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$. We first need to show that the series $\sum a_n^\prime$ converges.   let $p$ be a natural number such that $$\{1, \ldots, N \} \subset \{ k_1, \ldots, k_p \}.$$ Then, for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n > p$, we have    $$ \vert s_n^\prime - s_n \vert = \left\vert \sum_{i \in \{ k_1, \ldots, k_n \} \setminus \{1, \ldots, n \} } a_i  \right\vert \leq \sum_{i \in \{ k_1, \ldots, k_n \} \setminus \{1, \ldots, n \} } \vert a_i \vert \leq \sum_{i = N+1}^{\max ( \{ k_1, \ldots, k_n \} \setminus \{1, \ldots, N \} )} \vert a_i \vert < \varepsilon. $$ Now let's suppose that $$\lim_{n \to \infty} s_n = s.$$ Then for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n > p$, we have $$0 \leq \vert s_n^\prime - s \vert \leq \vert s_n^\prime - s_n \vert + \vert s_n - s \vert < \epsilon + \vert s_n - s \vert \to \epsilon + 0 \ \mbox{ as } \ n \to \infty.$$ So, $$ 0 \leq \lim_{n \to \infty} \vert s_n^\prime - s \vert \leq \epsilon,$$ provided that the limit exists (i.e. provided that the sequence $\{s_n^\prime \}$ converges). We now show that the sequence $\{s_n^\prime \}$ is Cauchy. For all $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n \geq m > p$, we have $$ \vert s_n^\prime - s_m^\prime \vert \leq \sum_{i = m+1}^n \vert a_i^\prime \vert \leq  \sum_{i = N+1}^{\max( \{ k_{m+1}, \ldots, k_n \} )} \vert a_i \vert < \varepsilon,$$ showing that the sequence $\{s_n^\prime \}$ is indeed Cauchy. So for all $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n \geq m > p$, we have $$ \left\vert \vert s_n^\prime - s \vert - \vert s_m^\prime - s \vert \right\vert \leq \left\vert (s_n^\prime - s) - (s_m^\prime - s) \right\vert = \vert s_n^\prime - s_m^\prime \vert < \varepsilon,$$ showing that the sequence $\{ \vert s_n^\prime - s \vert \}$ is Cauchy. Therefore $ \lim_{n \to \infty} \vert s_n^\prime - s \vert $ exists and we also  have $$0 \leq \lim_{n \to \infty} \vert s_n^\prime - s \vert \leq \varepsilon$$ for every $\varepsilon >0$, which shows that the last limit is $0$ and therefore $$ \lim_{n \to \infty} s_n^\prime = s.$$ Is this presentation correct? Have I understood Rudin's logic correctly? If there are any errors or issues in my presentation, please do point those out!!

We first need to show that the series $\sum a_n^\prime$ converges.   let $p$ be a natural number such that $$\{1, \ldots, N \} \subset \{ k_1, \ldots, k_p \}.$$ Then, for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n > p$, we have    $$ \vert s_n^\prime - s_n \vert = \left\vert \sum_{i \in \{ k_1, \ldots, k_n \} \setminus \{1, \ldots, n \} } a_i  \right\vert \leq \sum_{i \in \{ k_1, \ldots, k_n \} \setminus \{1, \ldots, n \} } \vert a_i \vert \leq \sum_{i = N+1}^{\max ( \{ k_1, \ldots, k_n \} \setminus \{1, \ldots, N \} )} \vert a_i \vert < \varepsilon. $$ Now let's suppose that $$\lim_{n \to \infty} s_n = s.$$ Then for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n > p$, we have $$0 \leq \vert s_n^\prime - s \vert \leq \vert s_n^\prime - s_n \vert + \vert s_n - s \vert < \epsilon + \vert s_n - s \vert \to \epsilon + 0 \ \mbox{ as } \ n \to \infty.$$ So, $$ 0 \leq \lim_{n \to \infty} \vert s_n^\prime - s \vert \leq \epsilon,$$ provided that the limit exists (i.e. provided that the sequence $\{s_n^\prime \}$ converges). We now show that the sequence $\{s_n^\prime \}$ is Cauchy. For all $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n \geq m > p$, we have $$ \vert s_n^\prime - s_m^\prime \vert \leq \sum_{i = m+1}^n \vert a_i^\prime \vert \leq  \sum_{i = N+1}^{\max( \{ k_{m+1}, \ldots, k_n \} )} \vert a_i \vert < \varepsilon,$$ showing that the sequence $\{s_n^\prime \}$ is indeed Cauchy. So for all $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n \geq m > p$, we have $$ \left\vert \vert s_n^\prime - s \vert - \vert s_m^\prime - s \vert \right\vert \leq \left\vert (s_n^\prime - s) - (s_m^\prime - s) \right\vert = \vert s_n^\prime - s_m^\prime \vert < \varepsilon,$$ showing that the sequence $\{ \vert s_n^\prime - s \vert \}$ is Cauchy.

Let $r \in S$ with $$r = \sum_{i=1}^{n} r_i \chi_{A_i}$$  be such that $|r_i - c_i| <1$ and $\mu((E_i\setminus A_i) \cup (A_i\setminus E_i)) < \frac{\epsilon^p}{2n}$ with the $A_i$ pairwise disjoint, wlog. Then, \begin{eqnarray*} \left( \int_\mathbb{R} |s-r|^p \, d\mu \right)^\frac{1}{p} &\leq& \left( \int_\mathbb{R} \left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}|c_i\chi_{E_i}-r\chi_{A_i}| \right)^p \, d\mu  \right)^\frac{1}{p} \\ & \stackrel{Minkowski}{\leq}& \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( \int_\mathbb{R} |c_i\chi_{E_i}-r_i\chi_{A_i}|^p \, d\mu \right)^\frac{1}{p} \\ &<& \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( \int_\mathbb{R} |\chi_{(E_i\setminus A_i) \cup (A_i\setminus E_i)}|^p \, d\mu \right)^\frac{1}{p} \\ &=& \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( \int_{(E_i\setminus A_i) \cup (A_i\setminus E_i)} 1 \, d\mu \right)^\frac{1}{p} \\ &<& \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\frac{\epsilon^p}{n})^\frac{1}{p} = \frac{\epsilon}{2} \end{eqnarray*} since $$|c_i\chi_{E_i} - r_i\chi_{A_i}| = \begin{cases}   0 \quad \,:  x \notin A_i \cup E_i, x \in A_i \cap E_i\\ |c_i-r_i| \quad \, : x \in  (E_i \setminus A_i) \cup (A_i \setminus E_i). \\ \end{cases} < \chi_{(E_i\setminus A_i) \cup (A_i\setminus E_i)} $$ and therefore $\|f-r\|_{L^p} < \epsilon$, as desired.

For example:  $$ \begin{aligned} P_0 &= (0,0) & \vec P_0 &= \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} & \gamma &= 90° \\ P_1 &= (3,3) & \vec P_1 &= \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} & \gamma &= 0° \end{aligned}  $$ The resulting minimum radius of the curve should be as big as possible between the two points. In addition the length of the path should also be as short as possible. There should be no addition of extra straight paths or very big loops to stretch the radius. For now I tried to access this problem with Beziér curves, Hermite curves and ellipses but for none I got the sufficient solution.",,"['analysis', 'geometry']"
