I understand that the maximum and minimum number of handshakes that can take place are 6 and 0 and that these people must be married. Similarly I get that other pairs should be (5,1) (4,2) and (3,3). What has really been bothering me is that how do I know which pair is me and my wife?",,['combinatorics']

28,Is this an adjunction?,Is this an adjunction?,,"(Write $\langle S\rangle$ for the submonoid generated by $S$.) Let $A$ denote a set and $S$ denote a subset of $A^*$ equipped with a distinguished well-ordering. Let $M$ denote a monoid and $f : S \rightarrow M$ denote a function. Then we get a corresponding function $f' : \langle S\rangle \rightarrow M,$ defined recursively as follows. Firstly, $f'(1) = 1$. Secondly, for all $x \in S$ and $y \in \langle S \rangle$, if for all $x' \in S$ and $y' \in \langle S \rangle$ satisfying $x'y' = xy$ we have $x \leq x'$, then $f'(xy) = f(x) f'(y).$ That's perhaps a little hard to understand, so let me give an example. Let $A = \{b,c\}$ and $S = \{bc \leq b \leq c\}$. Let $M = \{a,b,c\}^*$ and define that $f:S \rightarrow M$ be given by $$bc \mapsto a, b \mapsto b, c \mapsto c.$$ Then the corresponding function $$f' : \langle bc,b,c\rangle \rightarrow M$$ just has the effect of replacing each subword of the form $bc$ with the symbol $a$. For example: $$f'(bbcc) = f(b)f'(bcc) = f(b)f(bc)f'(c) = f(b)f(bc)f(c)f'(1) = f(b)f(bc)f(c) = bac$$ (The initial motivation for this question is that the function $f'$ that replaces $bc$'s with $a$' came up naturally while solving a problem about binomial paths on the latest combinatorics assignment.) Now, getting from $f : S \rightarrow M$ to $f' : \langle S \rangle \rightarrow M$ kind of looks like an adjunction, in the sense of category theory. I haven't been able to formalize this. So: Question. Is this an adjunction? If so, what are the relevant categories and functors? (Lesser question: in monoid theory, does what I'm denoting $f'$ have a name?) Addendum. The motivation behind $f'$ was requested, so here it is. Let $A_k$ denote the set of all $k$-length words $x$ in the alphabet $\{U,D\}$ such that for every prefix $p$ of $x,$ we have $|p|_U \geq |p|_D$. For example, $UUDD \in A_4$ has this property, because the prefixes of this word are $$\{1,U,UU,UUD,UUDD\}$$ and it can be seen that there's always at least as many $U$'s as $D$'s. (This can be visualized as a zig-zag pattern ($U$ = up and one step to the right, $D$ = down and one step to the right) in $\mathbb{R}^2$ that starts at the origin and never goes below the $x$-axis.) Okay. Here's some numbers: $$|A_1| = |\{U\}| = 1$$ $$|A_3| = |\{UUU;UUD,UDU\}| = 3$$ $$|A_5| = |\{UUUUU;UDUUU,UUDUU,UUUDU,UUUUD;UDUDU,UUDDU,UDUUD,UUDUD,UUUDD\}| = 10$$ The problem is to show that: Theorem. If $k$ is odd, then $|A_k| = \frac{1}{2}\binom{k+1}{(k+1)/2}.$ Our solution was as follows. Let $B_k$ denote the set of all $k$-length words $x$ in the alphabet $\{U,D\}$ such that $|x|_U = |x|_D$ and $x_0 = D$. (This can be visualized as a length $2k$ zig-zag pattern that starts at the origin, whose first step is $D$ and which ends somewhere on the $x$-axis). For $k$ odd, $B_k$ is empty. But if $k$ is even, we have: $$|B_k| = \frac{1}{2}\binom{k}{k/2}$$ Now let $k$ denote a fixed but arbitrary odd number. We're going to define a function $$\varphi:A_k \rightarrow B_{k+1}.$$ If this function $f$ can be shown to be a bijection, then we can argue as follows: $$|A_k| = |B_{k+1}| = \frac{1}{2}\binom{k+1}{(k+1)/2}$$ which proves the result. Informally, our proposed $\varphi$ was as follows: Consider $x \in A_k$. Change $x$ by adjoining a $D$ symbol on the left. Note that the result is necessarily an element of $A_{k+1}$, due to the oddness of $k$. Now go through and start changing $U$'s into $D$'s from left-to-right, but with the condition that patterns of the form $UD$ are skipped over; they're not to be touched. Stop when the number of $D$'s is large enough that it equals the number of $U$'s, which is now smaller. Call the result $\varphi(x)$. Here's an illustration of $\varphi$ for $k=5$, for example. The first arrow indicates adjoining a $D$ to the beginning of the word, and the second arrow indicates the rest of the process. $$UUUUU \mapsto DUUUUU \mapsto DDDUUU$$ $$UUUUU \mapsto DUDUUU \mapsto DUDDUU$$ $$UUUUU \mapsto DUUDUU \mapsto DDUDUU$$ $$UUUUU \mapsto DUUUDU \mapsto DDUUDU$$ $$UUUUU \mapsto DUUUUD \mapsto DDUUUD$$ $$UUUUU \mapsto DUDUDU \mapsto DUDUDU$$ $$UUUUU \mapsto DUUDDU \mapsto DUUDDU$$ $$UUUUU \mapsto DUDUUD \mapsto DUDUUD$$ $$UUUUU \mapsto DUUDUD \mapsto DUUDUD$$ The question then becomes: how can we formally define $\varphi$? Let $A$ denote the set $\{U,D\}$ and $S$ denote the poset $\{UD\leq U\leq D\}$. Define $f : S \rightarrow \{A,U,D\}^*$ as follows: $$f(UD) = A,f(U)=U,f(D)=D$$ Then we get a corresponding function $$f' : \{U,D\}^* \rightarrow \{A,U,D\}^*$$ by applying the construction under question. It follows that $f'$ has the effect of removing $UD$ patterns and replacing them with $A$'s. For example: $$f'(DUDUUU) = Df'(UDUUU) = DAf'(UUU) = \cdots = DAUUUf'(1) = DAUUU.$$ Once we've got the word in this form, it becomes easy to define the function that replaces $U$'s with $D$'s without touching $UD$'s, because we've replaced all the $UD$'s with $A$'s. Omitting certain details that the reader can easily work out for themselves, the full chain for $UDUUU \in A_5$ ends up looking something like this: $$UDUUU \mapsto DUDUUU \mapsto DAUUU \mapsto DADUU \mapsto DUDDUU$$","(Write $\langle S\rangle$ for the submonoid generated by $S$.)

Then we get a corresponding function $f' : \langle S\rangle \rightarrow M,$ defined recursively as follows. Firstly, $f'(1) = 1$. Secondly, for all $x \in S$ and $y \in \langle S \rangle$, if for all $x' \in S$ and $y' \in \langle S \rangle$ satisfying $x'y' = xy$ we have $x \leq x'$, then $f'(xy) = f(x) f'(y).$ That's perhaps a little hard to understand, so let me give an example. Let $A = \{b,c\}$ and $S = \{bc \leq b \leq c\}$. Let $M = \{a,b,c\}^*$ and define that $f:S \rightarrow M$ be given by $$bc \mapsto a, b \mapsto b, c \mapsto c.$$ Then the corresponding function $$f' : \langle bc,b,c\rangle \rightarrow M$$ just has the effect of replacing each subword of the form $bc$ with the symbol $a$. For example: $$f'(bbcc) = f(b)f'(bcc) = f(b)f(bc)f'(c) = f(b)f(bc)f(c)f'(1) = f(b)f(bc)f(c) = bac$$ (The initial motivation for this question is that the function $f'$ that replaces $bc$'s with $a$' came up naturally while solving a problem about binomial paths on the latest combinatorics assignment.) Now, getting from $f : S \rightarrow M$ to $f' : \langle S \rangle \rightarrow M$ kind of looks like an adjunction, in the sense of category theory. I haven't been able to formalize this. So: Question. Is this an adjunction? If so, what are the relevant categories and functors? (Lesser question: in monoid theory, does what I'm denoting $f'$ have a name?) Addendum. The motivation behind $f'$ was requested, so here it is. Let $A_k$ denote the set of all $k$-length words $x$ in the alphabet $\{U,D\}$ such that for every prefix $p$ of $x,$ we have $|p|_U \geq |p|_D$. For example, $UUDD \in A_4$ has this property, because the prefixes of this word are $$\{1,U,UU,UUD,UUDD\}$$ and it can be seen that there's always at least as many $U$'s as $D$'s. (This can be visualized as a zig-zag pattern ($U$ = up and one step to the right, $D$ = down and one step to the right) in $\mathbb{R}^2$ that starts at the origin and never goes below the $x$-axis.) Okay. Here's some numbers: $$|A_1| = |\{U\}| = 1$$ $$|A_3| = |\{UUU;UUD,UDU\}| = 3$$ $$|A_5| = |\{UUUUU;UDUUU,UUDUU,UUUDU,UUUUD;UDUDU,UUDDU,UDUUD,UUDUD,UUUDD\}| = 10$$ The problem is to show that: Theorem. If $k$ is odd, then $|A_k| = \frac{1}{2}\binom{k+1}{(k+1)/2}.$ Our solution was as follows. Let $B_k$ denote the set of all $k$-length words $x$ in the alphabet $\{U,D\}$ such that $|x|_U = |x|_D$ and $x_0 = D$. (This can be visualized as a length $2k$ zig-zag pattern that starts at the origin, whose first step is $D$ and which ends somewhere on the $x$-axis). For $k$ odd, $B_k$ is empty. But if $k$ is even, we have: $$|B_k| = \frac{1}{2}\binom{k}{k/2}$$ Now let $k$ denote a fixed but arbitrary odd number. We're going to define a function $$\varphi:A_k \rightarrow B_{k+1}.$$ If this function $f$ can be shown to be a bijection, then we can argue as follows: $$|A_k| = |B_{k+1}| = \frac{1}{2}\binom{k+1}{(k+1)/2}$$ which proves the result. Informally, our proposed $\varphi$ was as follows: Consider $x \in A_k$. Change $x$ by adjoining a $D$ symbol on the left. Note that the result is necessarily an element of $A_{k+1}$, due to the oddness of $k$. Now go through and start changing $U$'s into $D$'s from left-to-right, but with the condition that patterns of the form $UD$ are skipped over; they're not to be touched. Stop when the number of $D$'s is large enough that it equals the number of $U$'s, which is now smaller. Call the result $\varphi(x)$. Here's an illustration of $\varphi$ for $k=5$, for example. The first arrow indicates adjoining a $D$ to the beginning of the word, and the second arrow indicates the rest of the process. $$UUUUU \mapsto DUUUUU \mapsto DDDUUU$$ $$UUUUU \mapsto DUDUUU \mapsto DUDDUU$$ $$UUUUU \mapsto DUUDUU \mapsto DDUDUU$$ $$UUUUU \mapsto DUUUDU \mapsto DDUUDU$$ $$UUUUU \mapsto DUUUUD \mapsto DDUUUD$$ $$UUUUU \mapsto DUDUDU \mapsto DUDUDU$$ $$UUUUU \mapsto DUUDDU \mapsto DUUDDU$$ $$UUUUU \mapsto DUDUUD \mapsto DUDUUD$$ $$UUUUU \mapsto DUUDUD \mapsto DUUDUD$$ The question then becomes: how can we formally define $\varphi$? Let $A$ denote the set $\{U,D\}$ and $S$ denote the poset $\{UD\leq U\leq D\}$. Define $f : S \rightarrow \{A,U,D\}^*$ as follows: $$f(UD) = A,f(U)=U,f(D)=D$$ Then we get a corresponding function $$f' : \{U,D\}^* \rightarrow \{A,U,D\}^*$$ by applying the construction under question. It follows that $f'$ has the effect of removing $UD$ patterns and replacing them with $A$'s. For example: $$f'(DUDUUU) = Df'(UDUUU) = DAf'(UUU) = \cdots = DAUUUf'(1) = DAUUU.$$ Once we've got the word in this form, it becomes easy to define the function that replaces $U$'s with $D$'s without touching $UD$'s, because we've replaced all the $UD$'s with $A$'s. Omitting certain details that the reader can easily work out for themselves, the full chain for $UDUUU \in A_5$ ends up looking something like this: $$UDUUU \mapsto DUDUUU \mapsto DAUUU \mapsto DADUU \mapsto DUDDUU$$",,"['combinatorics', 'category-theory', 'terminology', 'binomial-coefficients', 'monoid']"

He recently came to me with a problem he's been wondering about for years: In a professional sumo tournament there are 42 wrestlers. A tournament lasts 15 days. Each wrestler fights once per day. Each bout is with a different opponent. There are no repeat matches. Each bout results in either a win or a loss, there are no ties. Each wrestler will finish with a win/loss record that totals 15 (e.g., 15-0, 0-15, 8-7, 7-8). What is the maximum number of wrestlers out of the 42 that can finish with a winning record (8-7 or better )? What is the maximum number that can finish with a perfect 15-0 record? For the purpose of this problem we'll ignore differences in skill and assume that all wrestlers are equal to each other. In reality the wrestler ranked #1 is almost certainly going to beat #42 every time. To keep it simple we'll treat matches as if they were random coin tosses. Additionally the exact pairings can be random. In a real tournament wrestlers only fight other wrestlers around their own rank; #1 would never have to suffer the indignity of fighting #42. Since we're ignoring skill that fact can also be overlooked. We must also assume no wrestler drops out of the tournament before the 15 days are finished.

For example if $|X| = 5$. Let ${\{a, b, c, d, e}\}$ represent the number of times each of the five letters appears in a length $n$ word over $X$. With no restrictions I believe the number of words would be $5^n$. What about subject to the restriction $2a+2e=2d+2b-c$?

Although this process provided insight, it did not lead to an easily scaled method.","\psi: S \rightarrow S S = \{1,2,\dots,n\} \textit{descriptive} k < n \psi \{1,2,\dots,k\} \{1,2,\dots,k\} \textit{descriptive} \{1,2,3,4,5,6\} \textbf{Analytical Journey:} \textbf{Initial Observation:} \psi(a_1) \neq a_1 \textbf{Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion Strategy:} 15! \textbf{Recurrence Relation Formulation:} n n \textbf{Investigation of Generating Functions:} \textbf{Pattern Identification through Smaller Cases:} n","['combinatorics', 'permutations', 'recurrence-relations', 'generating-functions']"

98,"How many ways can you rearrange the letters of the word ""CALENDAR"" if 'C' and 'A' must be together?","How many ways can you rearrange the letters of the word ""CALENDAR"" if 'C' and 'A' must be together?",,"I'm trying to solve the following questions : a) You are given the word ""CALENDAR"". How many ways can you rearrange the letters with the restriction that 'C' and 'A' must be together? b) With the same word ""CALENDAR"", how many ways can you rearrange the letters with the restriction that 'C' and 'A' must be together and 'N' and 'D' cannot be together? Given the word ""POLYNOMIAL"", how many ways can you rearrange the letters such that 'P' is next to 'O' and 'N' and 'M' cannot be together. My approach for 1. a) was as follows: Step 1: Group 'C' and 'A' together and substitute them with 'X'. Then, the word becomes ""XLENDAR."" Step 2: Calculate the permutations of this pseudo 7-letter word while accounting for the fact that 'X' has two permutations for every appearance ('CA' or 'AC'). Number of permutations of ""XLENDAR"" = $7! \times 2 = 10,080$ . My confusion here is about the repetition of the letter 'A' in the original word ""CALENDAR"" and how to deal with it. Consider a sample of the permutations as follows: A, CA, L, E, N, D, R AC, A, L, E, N, D, R This would be double-counting the same permutation if using the formula above, right? How do we deal with this pattern that can appear if the letters 'A' and 'CA' are arranged beside each other as a palindrome? This pattern can shift from the beginning of the word till the end a total of 6 times, so do we subtract 6 from 10,080? For part b) I grouped 'D' and 'R' together as 'Y' to get XLEYAR. Following the same method as above, I calculated the permutations where 'D' and 'R' do appear together (remembering that both 'X' and 'Y' have 2 permutations each every occurrence). $6! \times 2 \times 2 = 2880$ . Subtracting these occurrences from the original total should tell me all the permutations that satisfy the condition for 1b). Once again, though, my confusion lies with the repeated 'A' in this calculation. I've seen some solutions presented as # of permutations $= 10,080 - 2880 = 7200$ , but they don't address the repetition in their calculations. I'd really appreciate some help as I'm not sure where to go from here. Thank you!","I'm trying to solve the following questions : a) You are given the word ""CALENDAR"".

99,Two poset properties: are they related?,Two poset properties: are they related?,,"A bunch of infinite posets $P$ with $\hat 0$ have the following property For every $x\in P$ , the principal filter $\{ y\in P : y\ge x\}$ is isomorphic as a poset to $P$ itself.
