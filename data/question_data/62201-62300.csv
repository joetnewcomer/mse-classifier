0,Finding the the number of Lattice paths with three steps.,Finding the the number of Lattice paths with three steps.,,"We define a nice path of length as a path on a lattice from $(0,0)$ to $(n,n)$ such as every step in it is: $r=(0,1)$ , $u=(1,0)$ and $v=(1,2)$ , and it does not go under the line $y=x$ . A. Write a formula for the generating function that counts the number of the nice paths. B.Solve the above formula and find an expression for the number of these paths of length n. C.Find the number of $(1,2)$ steps in all paths of length n. I started with drawing the possible paths for $n=1,2,3,4$ , getting that we have $1,3,9,27$ paths (respectively) if I did really succeed to count all the possible paths for each $n$ . So, then I concluded that each legal path (which is mentioned above) is: Every path = $\epsilon$ or v(every path) u (every path) or r(every path) u (every path). Whhere $\epsilon$ denote the empty path. If $A(x)$ the generating function and x denote the number of steps then I get: $A(x)=1+(xA(x))(xA(x))+(xA(x))(xA(x))$ . $A(x)=1+x^2A(x)^2+x^2A(x)^2$ In B.

1,solving license plate equations,solving license plate equations,,"When I'm a passenger in a car and don't have anything to do, I try to turn the strings of numbers on license plates into equations (I call this solving the license plate).

Here's what that looks like for an alphabet of two symbols The blue and green arrows correspond to inputs of the two different types of symbols. The accepting states of the DFA are 02, 20 and 22. The number of accepted words of length $k$ is then the number of paths of length $k$ from the initial state to an accepting state. From this cs stackexchange question I've found that once you have the transition matrix of the DFA, the problem boils down to calculating powers of the transition matrix, and then looking at particular rows and columns. Unfortunately, there are $3^s$ states in the DFA (for each symbol, we can have encountered it 0, 1 or more than 1 times), and $s\times 3^s$ nonzero transitions between them. Combinatorial, approach My second approach to this problem was to try and find a recursive expression for $Q^s_k$ . If we restrict the alphabet to one symbol, i.e. $s = 1$ , then if $k \neq 1$ , there's exactly one valid word, otherwise there are none. Note that by definition the empty word is valid. If we extend the alphabet to two words, we can write the new expression in terms of $Q^1$ , giving $Q^2_k = \sum_{m=0; m\neq1}^k Q^1_{k-m} C(k, m)$ . The idea is that we can form valid words with two symbols by taking $m$ instances of the new symbol and inserting into the valid words of length $k - m$ with one symbol. We don't use $m = 1$ in the sum since that would not give a valid word, and the case $k -m$ = 1 is taken care of by the fact that $Q^1_1 = 0$ . The combinatorial factor accounts for the fact that we have to select $m$ slots in the final string for the occurrences of the new symbol, and all permutations of those slots are equivalent. In fact, this approach generalises neatly to the recursive expression \begin{equation} \tag{*}\label{eq:combinatorics} Q^{s+1}_k = \sum_{m=0; m\neq1}^k Q^{s}_{k-m} C(k, m),   \end{equation} since the logic for what happens when we add a new symbol to an existing alphabet is exactly the same. Unfortunately, that's about where I got stuck. Inclusion exclusion As an alternative to trying to count all the valid words, we could take the perspective that the number of valid words is the total number of words minus the number of invalid words. For example, the number of valid words of length $k$ with an alphabet of two words is $Q^2_k = 2^k - 2k + 2\delta_{k,2}$ . The first term on the RHS is the total number of words of length $k$ . The next term accounts for the fact that all words with one occurrence of one symbol and $k-1$ of the other are invalid; there are two symbols and $k$ slots to fit them into, giving $2k$ . The last term accounts for the double counting that occurs when we exclude words where both the first and the second symbol occur exactly once. In general we start with the $s^k$ possible words, and subtract all words where a given symbol only occurs once. For each symbol there are $k (s-1)^{k-1}$ such words, since there are $k$ slots for the symbol of interest, and the remaining slots must be filled from an alphabet consisting of all the other symbols. This gives $s\cdot k\cdot (s-1)^{k-1}$ words where a symbol occurs only once. However, this double counts all the cases where two symbols occur only once. There are $C(s, 2)$ pairs of symbols in the alphabet, and there are $P(k, 2)$ possible permutations of these symbols in a word of length $k$ . The remaining $(k - 2)$ symbols are chosen from an alphabet of length $s - 2$ , giving $(s-2)^{k-2}C(s, 2) P(s, 2)$ words of this form. Continuing, we arrive at the general expression \begin{equation} \tag{**}\label{eq:inclusion} Q^{s}_k = \sum_{i=0}^{\mathrm{min}(s, k)} (-1)^{i}(s - i)^{k-i} C(s, i) P(k, i) \end{equation} Note that for this expression to be true, we must consider $0^0 = 1$ . Again, I was unable to simplify this much further. Questions Constructing the giant DFA feels like an unsatisfactory approach, because it completely ignores the symmetries in the problem. If the DFA is in the initial state "" $000\ldots$ "", then any symbol it encounters is in some sense equivalent.

This means $a_{2}=1100000$ and $a_{3}=1110000$ . Determine $a_{2017}$ . Attempt: Let us define $a_{0}=0000000$ and present the terms for $n=1,2,...,20$ , $$ a_{1} = 1000000, a_{2} = 1100000, a_{3} = 1110000, a_{4} = 1111000, a_{5} = 1111100$$ $$ a_{6} = 1111110, a_{7} = 1111111, a_{8} = 2000000, a_{9} = 2100000, a_{10} = 2110000$$ $$ a_{11} = 2111110, a_{12} = 2111111, a_{13} = 2200000, a_{14} = 2210000, a_{15} = 2211000$$ $$ a_{16} = 2211100, a_{17} = 2211110, a_{18} = 2211111, a_{19} = 2220000, a_{20} = 2221000$$ We can analyse that the number of sequence that has $1$ as leading digit is $\binom{7}{1} = \binom{6+1}{1}$ .  Also the number of sequence that has 2 as leading digit is $\binom{6+2}{2}$ .  In general, the number of sequence that has $j >= 1$ as leading digit is $\binom{6+j}{j}$ . The number of sequence that has leading digit $1,2,..,m$ is therefore: $$ \alpha_{m} = \sum_{j=1}^{m} \binom{6+j}{j}$$ Which means that $a_{\alpha_{m}}$ is the last sequence that has $m$ as leading digit. We can find the simplified form for each $\alpha_{m}$ . We will prove that $$ \alpha_{m} = \sum_{j=1}^{m} \binom{6+j}{j} = \sum_{j=1}^{m} \binom{6+j}{6} $$ $$ = \binom{7}{6} + \binom{8}{6} + \binom{9}{6} + ... + \binom{6+m}{6} = \binom{7+m}{7} - 1$$ We can see $\binom{7+m}{7}$ as the number of ways to pick 7 numbers from the set $\{1,2,...,7+m\}$ .  But the list can be grouped as, the choice(s) that has $1$ as minimum number, $2$ as minimum number, and so on. These means that $$ \binom{7+m}{7} = \binom{7+m-1}{6} + \binom{7+m-2}{6} + ... + \binom{7+m-m}{6} + \binom{7+m-(m+1)}{6} $$ $$ \binom{7+m}{7} = 1  + \sum_{j=1}^{m} \binom{6 + j}{6} $$ Thus $\alpha_{m}= \sum_{j=1}^{m} \binom{6 + j}{6} = \binom{7+m}{7} - 1$ . Let us check what value of $m$ such that $\alpha_{m-1} \le 2017 \le \alpha_{m}$ . $m$ is $7$ , $$ \alpha_{m-1} = 1715 \le 2017 \le \alpha_{m}=3431 $$ So the leading digit of $a_{2017}$ must be $7$ . The first sequence with leading 7 is $a_{1716}$ . How about the 2nd digit? The number of 6 digits sequence leading 1,2,..,5 is $\binom{6+5}{6} - 1 = 461$ , with leading 1,2,..,4 is $209$ .  Now because $1715 + 209 < 2017 < 1715 + 461$ , then we can conclude that the 2nd digit must be a 5. We can continue doing this until we find that $a_{2017}=75$ *****.

For example, $$x\rightarrow y=\big((x\operatorname{NOR}x)\operatorname{NOR}y\big)\operatorname{NOR}\big((x\operatorname{NOR}x)\operatorname{NOR}y\big)$$ and \begin{align}x\operatorname{XOR}y&= \Big(\big((p\operatorname{NAND}p)\operatorname{NAND}(q\operatorname{NAND}q)\big)\operatorname{NAND}\big((p\operatorname{NAND}p)\operatorname{NAND}(q\operatorname{NAND}q)\big)\Big) \\&\hphantom{123}\operatorname{NAND}\Big(\big((p\operatorname{NAND}p)\operatorname{NAND}(q\operatorname{NAND}q)\big)\operatorname{NAND}\big((p\operatorname{NAND}p)\operatorname{NAND}(q\operatorname{NAND}q)\big)\Big),\end{align} where $$p=\big(x\operatorname{NAND}(y\operatorname{NAND}y)\big)\operatorname{NAND}\big(x\operatorname{NAND}(y\operatorname{NAND}y)\big)$$ and $$q=\big((x\operatorname{NAND}x)\operatorname{NAND}y\big)\operatorname{NAND}\big((x\operatorname{NAND}x)\operatorname{NAND}y\big).$$ The notation $\rightarrow$ is the implication connective , and $\operatorname{XOR}$ is the exclusive-or operator . Definitions Let $S$ be a set and $f:S^m\to S$ is an $m$ -ary function (or $m$ -ary operator ).  A valid  expression in $f$ is an expression $E(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)$ , where $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n\in S$ involving only finite iterations of $f$ and using only variables among $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n$ . For example, if $m=n=2$ and $0\in S$ , $f\big(x_1,f(0,x_2)\big)$ is not a valid expression because there is a constant $0$ that is not in the form of the variables $x_1,x_2$ .  If $m=2$ , $n=1$ , $S=\mathbb{R}_{>0}$ , and $f(x_1,x_2)=\sqrt{x_1\sqrt{x_2}}$ , then this is also not a valid expression because it involves infinite iterations of $f$ : $$f\Biggl(x,f\Big(x,f\big(x,f(\ldots)\big)\Big)\Biggr)=\sqrt{x\sqrt{x\sqrt{x\sqrt{\ldots}}}}\ (=x).$$ (However, if you want to represent the identity function $x\mapsto x$ on $S=\mathbb{R}_{>0}$ with the function $f(x_1,x_2)=\sqrt{x_1\sqrt{x_2}}$ , this can be done without involving infinite iterations of $f$ like the previous example, i.e., $f\big(f(x,x),x\big)=\sqrt{(x\sqrt{x})\sqrt{x}}=x$ .) For $m=n=3$ , this is a valid expression of $f$ : $$f\Biggl(f\big(x_1,x_2,f(x_1,x_3,x_2)\big),f\Big(f\big(x_1,f(x_2,x_3,x_1),x_3\big),x_2,x_1\Big)\Biggr).$$ Also, not all variables need to be used.  So, for $m=n=2$ , $$f\big(x_1,f(x_1,x_1)\big)$$ is still a valid expression of $f$ .  In the previous example, one can say that this is a valid expression of $f$ with $m=2$ and $n=1$ , as well.  There can also be more variables than the number of arguments of $f$ , that is, if $m=2$ and $n=3$ , $$f\big(f(x_1,x_2),f(x_2,x_3)\big)$$ is a valid expression of $f$ . Let $g:S^n\to S$ .  We say that $g$ is representable by $f$ if there exists a valid expression $E(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)$ of $f$ such that $$g(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)=E(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)$$ for all $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n\in S$ .  For an $m$ -ary function $f:S^m\to S$ , we say that $f$ is $n$ -fulfilling if every $n$ -ary function $g:S^n\to S$ is representable by $f$ . Question For a given non-empty set $S$ and positive integers $m,n$ , when does there exist a $n$ -fulfilling $m$ -ary function $f:S^m\to S$ ?  Does there exist a set $S$ with $|S|\geq 3$ along with a positive integer $m$ such that for some an $m$ -ary function $f:S^m\to S$ exists, and for any positive integer $n$ , every $n$ -ary function $g:S^n\to S$ is representatble by $f$ . Has there been a study on this type of questions?  Any reference is greatly appreciated. Known Results If $S$ is infinite, then there are only countably many valid expressions of $f$ in $n$ variables, but there are uncountably many $n$ -ary functions $g:S^n\to S$ .  Therefore, such a function $f$ does not exist.  Hence, we can assume that $S$ is finite. If $m=1$ , then there exists an $n$ -fulfilling function $f:S\to S$ if and only if $|S|=1$ or $\big(n,|S|\big)=(1,2)$ .  Clearly, the only valid expression of $f$ in any number of variables is of the form $f^k(x)$ .  Therefore, when $|S|>1$ , there can only be one variable, so $n=1$ .  However, since the permutation group on $S$ is not abelian for $|S|>2$ , we must have $|S|=2$ (provided that $|S|>1$ ). Of course, if $|S|=1$ , then any $m$ -ary function $f:S^m\to S$ and any $n$ -ary function $g:S^m\to S$ have the same image.  So, this case is very trivial.   If $|S|=2$ , I think that we can identify $S$ as the boolean ring $\{0,1\}$ and use the $\operatorname{NAND}$ or $\operatorname{NOR}$ operators to represent any $n$ -ary function $g:S^n\to S$ .

I listed the possibilities for 3 dots: If all three colors are different then the middle one is the final one (e.g.  B R Y = R) If two colors are involved then If the odd one is in the middle, it is the color not involved (e.g.  YBY = R) If the odd one is the first or last it is that one (e.g YBB = Y) However I don't understand how I can apply the above pattern to 4, 5, and then 28 dots to come up with a quicker solution.","Problem : There is an inverted triangle colored dots. The colors are red, blue and yellow. If the two dots above are the same color, then the third dot below matches both. If the two dots above are different colors, then the third one below is different from either. Above are some examples If you make a colored row of only 3 dots, can you predict the outcome? Is there a pattern? How about 4 dots. Try the same for 5 and 6 dots and see if you can find any simplifications. Use this pattern to predict a row of 28 dots.

95,Partition edges of complete graph into paths of distinct length [duplicate],Partition edges of complete graph into paths of distinct length [duplicate],,"This question already has an answer here : Complete Graphs as Unions of Paths (1 answer) Closed 2 years ago . Let $K_n$ be the complete undirected graph on $n$ vertices. Can you partition the edges of $K_n$ into $n-1$ paths of lengths $1,2,\ldots,n-1$ such that the edge-sets of the paths are pairwise disjoint? I believe the statement to be true, but I cannot prove it. It also possible that this is an open problem.","This question already has an answer here : Complete Graphs as Unions of Paths (1 answer) Closed 2 years ago .

97,Number Theory and d-Self-Contained Numbers,Number Theory and d-Self-Contained Numbers,,"Given any natural number $N = a_{n}a_{n-1}\ldots a_{1}$, let us associate to it the set $S_{N} = \bigcup_{j=1}^{n}\{(a_{j},j)\}$. We're going to define a d-self-contained number as any natural number which satisfies the rule: \begin{align*} &\forall k\leq n,\exists\sigma\subset S_{N}\setminus\{(a_{k},k)\}; a_{k} = \sum_{s\in\sigma}(-1)^{e_{s}}\|p_{1}(s)\|^{d},\\ &\text{where}\,\,n\geq 3,\,\,e_{s}\in\{0,1\}\,\,\text{and}\,\,\#\sigma\geq 2 \end{align*} In other words, a number is d-self-contained if each of its digits can be obtained from the others as a linear combination of their d-th power (where d is natural and fixed) whose coefficients belong to the set {-1,0,1}, where at least two of these coefficients are non-zero terms. It is worth saying that $p_{1}$ is the projection mapping on the first coordinate. Let us work it through examples. The number 101 is 2-self-contained since we can rewrite its digits as: $1 = 0^{2} + 1^{2}$ and $0 = 1^{2} - 1^{2}$. Furthermore, the number 101 is d-self-contained for every d. Indeed, we have:  $$1 = 0 + 1 = 0^{d} + 1^{d}\,\,\text{and}\,\,0 = 1 - 1 = 1^{d} - 1^{d}$$ On the other hand, the number 121 is not 2-self-contained given that: $$1 \neq 2^{2} - 1^{2}\,\,\text{and}\,\,1\neq 2^{2} + 1^{2}$$ Although it is 1-self-contained. What about the 3-self-contained numbers? Here it comes an example which proves that they exist: 111111112. Undoubtedly, its digits satisfy the following relationships: $$1 = 2^{3} - 1^{3} - 1^{3} - 1^{3} - 1^{3} - 1^{3} - 1^{3} - 1^{3}\,\,\text{and}\,\,2 = 1^{3} + 1^{3}$$ Even more, this number is also 1,2-self-contained. Really, we have: $$1 = 2 - 1\,\,\text{and}\,\,2 = 1 + 1;\quad 1 = 2^{2} - 1^{2} - 1^{2} - 1^{2}\,\,\text{and}\,\,2 = 1^{2} + 1^{2}$$ Besides that, this example provides us with a way to build any d-self-contained number: $$N = \overbrace{11\ldots 1}^{2^{d}}2\Rightarrow 2^{d} = \overbrace{1^{d} + 1^{d} + \ldots + 1^{d}}^{2^{d}}\,\,\text{and}\,\,1 = 2^{d} - \overbrace{1^{d} - 1^{d} - \ldots - 1^{d}}^{2^{d} - 1}$$ Since the definition has been made clear, I would like to make some questions. First of all, does any one can propose any criterion to identify them quickly? In second place, is there any formula which generates them all? And, finally, if we denote the set of d-self-contained numbers by $A_{d}$, does the next proposition hold: $A_{1}\supset A_{2}\supset\ldots\supset A_{k}\supset\ldots$?
