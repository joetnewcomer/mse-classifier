22,Is $2\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}$ NOT a field?!,Is  NOT a field?!,2\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z},"According to wikipedia : If $R$ is a unital commutative ring with an ideal $m$, then $k = R/m$ is a field if and only if $m$ is a maximal ideal. In that case, $R/m$ is known as the residue field. This fact can fail in non-unital rings. For example, $4\mathbb{Z}$ is a maximal ideal in $2\mathbb{Z}$ , but $2\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}$ is not a field. Is $2\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}$ NOT a field?! Isn't it isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z_2}$? I mean every element in $2\mathbb{Z}$ is of the form $2k$ for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}$. Now suppose that I define $\psi: \mathbb{2Z} \to \mathbb{Z}_2$ where $2k \mapsto \bar{0}$ if $k$ is even and $2k  \mapsto \bar{1}$ if $k$ is odd. This map is well-defined because we have only one representation as $2k$ for each element of $2\mathbb{Z}$. This map is surjective because at least $0$ is mapped to $\bar{0}$ and $2$ is mapped to $\bar{1}$. Is $\psi$ a homomorphism? Well, to me it sounds like it must be. Because the factor of $2$ is playing no role in here and only the parity of $k$ matters for the mapping so I think it is obvious that it is a homomorphism. Even though it can be checked directly by checking all 4 cases separately as well. So, what is the kernel? Isn't the kernel equal to $4\mathbb{Z}$? Doesn't that mean $2\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_2$? It makes sense that these two are isomorphic to me, where am I wrong?

Problem: Let $M$ be a Noetherian $A$-module. Show that $M[x]$ is a Noetherian $A[x]$-module. Solution: So, I can solve the problem with an extra assumption. That is, if we assume that $M$ is faithful (i.e., $Ann(M)=0$). In this case, it follows that $A$ is necessarily Noetherian as well. Hence, by Hilbert's Basis Theorem, it follows that $A[x]$ is Noetherian as well. It can easily be shown that $M[x]\cong A[x]\bigotimes_A M.$ I can also show that the tensor product of two Noetherian modules is Noetherian, hence the result. I am wondering though, does this result hold without this extra assumption? I guess, I'm not also sure whether the ring $A$ is always necessarily Noetherian if we do not require that our module $M$ be faithful?

For each object $x \in X$, the comma category $(f \downarrow x)$ has object which are objects $y \in Y$ with maps $f(y) \rightarrow x$ in $X$, and morphisms which are morphisms $a: y \rightarrow y'$ whose images make the evident triangle in $X$ commute. Then the author defines for each $F\in [Y, \mathbb{Vect}]$, $f_{*}(F)(x):=colim F(f \downarrow x)$. He also shows that $f_{*}(F)(y)=\bigoplus_{f(x)\cong y} \mathbb{C}[Aut(y)]\otimes_{\mathbb{C}[Aut(x)]}F(x)$ and fimilarly calculate $f^*f_*$ and $f_*f^*$. Later he says that this description accords with the susal description of these functors in the left adjunction. Then he mentions that the right adjoint is given as $f_*F(x)= \bigoplus_{[y], f(y)\cong x}hom_{\mathbb{C}[Aut(x)]}(\mathbb{C}[Aut(y), F(y)).$ Then we says: The Nalayama isomorphism gives the duality between the two descriptions of $f_*$, in terms of $hom_{\mathbb{C}[Aut(x)]}$ and $\otimes_{\mathbb{C}[Aut(x)]}$ by means of the exterior trace map. I understood the calculation of $f_*F(x)$ using a colimit defined above. But I don't know what it means by saying left or right adjoint. Also I don't know how to get the formula for the right adjoint. I even don't know what is Nakayama isomorphism. I searched for it but I couldn't find a good resource. So I would like to know what is going on here. Especially, I'd like to know; Why is the first construction using a colimit called ""left adjoint""? What is the right adjoint and how is it defined and how to calculate it to get the formula above. What is Nakayama isomorphism? I have never studied these things so I don't know where to look up. I also want good references. I appreciate any help. Thank you in advance.",,"['abstract-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry']"

There exists a left identity element $e$ in $G$ such that $e*x = x$ for all $x \in G$. For each $a \in G$ there exists a left inverse $a'$ in $G$ such that $a' * a = e$ From this one-sided definition, one can prove that the left identity element is also a right identity element, and a left inverse is also a right inverse for the same element. Thus these axioms should not be weaker, since they result in exactly the same structures being called groups. It is conceivable that it might be easier in some cases to check these left axioms that to check our two-sided axioms. Of course, by symmetry it is clear that there are also right axioms for a group. Does the above few axioms assume that the right identity element exists in the first place? Consider $a * b = \left|a\right|b$. There are at least two possible solutions for a ""right identity element"", namely: $$-1 * x = -1 \implies x = -1$$ $$1 * x = 1 \implies x = 1$$ Even though the group with operation $*$ satisfies axiom 2 of the weaker definition, it seems that $\left<G,*\right>$ cannot be a group, because using the original axioms of a group, there is no identity element $e$ such that $e*a = a * e = a$ for all $a \in G$. How then do the above axioms ""result in exactly the same structures being called groups""?","In ""A First Course in Abstract Algebra"", Edition 7, p.43, Fraleigh writes that It is possible to give axioms for a group $\left<G,*\right>$ that seem at first glance to be weaker, namely: The binary operation $*$ on $G$ is associative. There exists a left identity element $e$ in $G$ such that $e*x = x$ for all $x \in G$. For each $a \in G$ there exists a left inverse $a'$ in $G$ such that $a' * a = e$ From this one-sided definition, one can prove that the left identity element is also a right identity element, and a left inverse is also a right inverse for the same element. Thus these axioms should not be weaker, since they result in exactly the same structures being called groups. It is conceivable that it might be easier in some cases to check these left axioms that to check our two-sided axioms. Of course, by symmetry it is clear that there are also right axioms for a group. Does the above few axioms assume that the right identity element exists in the first place? Consider $a * b = \left|a\right|b$. There are at least two possible solutions for a ""right identity element"", namely: $$-1 * x = -1 \implies x = -1$$ $$1 * x = 1 \implies x = 1$$ Even though the group with operation $*$ satisfies axiom 2 of the weaker definition, it seems that $\left<G,*\right>$ cannot be a group, because using the original axioms of a group, there is no identity element $e$ such that $e*a = a * e = a$ for all $a \in G$.

99,When Eisenstein's Criterion applies to a shifted polynomial $f(x+k)$,When Eisenstein's Criterion applies to a shifted polynomial,f(x+k),"So we all know about Eisenstein's Criterion and how useful it turns out to be. In particular, if we have a monic cubic $x^3+ax^2+bx+c$, it is irreducible if there exists a prime number $p$ such that $p\mid a,b,c$ and $p^2\nmid c$. But suppose that a monic cubic is irreducible, and all its coefficients are positive, but there does not exist such a prime. Sometimes we can find an integer $k$ such that we can substitute $x=y+k$ into the cubic, and the resulting polynomial in $y$ will satisfy the criterion. For example, if we have the cubic $x^3+3x^2+5x+1$, then no $p$ exists, but if we substitute $x=y+3$ into it, we end up with $y^3+12y^2+50y+70$, which, taking $p=2$, satisfies the criterion, hence it is irreducible. My question is whether or not this stronger version of the criterion applies to every irreducible polynomial. That is to say, if $x^3+ax^2+bx+c$ is irreducible, then we can always find some integer $k$ such that $(y+k)^3+a(y+k)^2+b(y+k)+c$, when simplified, will satisfy the criterion.
