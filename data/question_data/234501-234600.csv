15,Show that either $[x] = [y]$ or $[x]$ and $[y]$ are disjoint?,Show that either  or  and  are disjoint?,[x] = [y] [x] [y],"An equivalence class $[x]_R$ is defined by $[x]_R = [y ∈ X : xRy]$. In this proof I'm supposed to start by assuming $[x]$ and $[y]$ are not disjoint. Therefore, there is some element $z$ that is in $[x]$ and $[y]$, so $z ∈ [x]$ and $z ∈ [y]$. From this point on I'm a bit unsure about what I can and can't do, but here is my attempt: Suppose there is an element $w$ that is also in $[x]$. I want to show that if it is in $[x]$ then it must also be in $[y]$. Because $w$ is in $[x]$, it is true that $xRw$ (where $R$ is an equivalence relation).

For any set $X$, if $X$ is equipotent to an ordinal $\alpha$, then $X$ can be ordered so that it is isomorphic to $\alpha$. This is the proof Let $X$ be a set such that it is equipotent to an ordinal $\alpha$. Thus there exists a bijection $f:X\rightarrow\alpha$. We then define the set $\prec$ to be       \begin{equation*} 	\prec:=\lbrace(x,y)\in X\times X:f(x)<f(y)\rbrace. 	\end{equation*}   To prove that $\prec$ is really a strict ordering, we are required to show that $\prec$ is asymmetric and transitive. Firstly, to prove that it is asymmetric, we suppose that $x\prec y$ holds. We assume for the sake of contradiction that $y\prec x$ also holds. Thus $f(x)<f(y)$ and $f(y)<f(x)$ which is a contradiction. Thus $y\prec x$ does not hold and hence $\prec$ is asymmetric. Secondly, to prove that $\prec$ is transitive, we suppose that $x\prec y$ and $y\prec z$. Thus $f(x)<f(y)$ and $f(y)<f(z)$. Since $<$ is transitive, it follows that $f(x)<f(z)$. Since $x,z\in X$, this implies that $x\prec z$. Thus $\prec$ is transitive and indeed a strict ordering.       Now, if $x,y\in X$ and $x\prec y$, then $f(x)<f(y)$ and thus $f$ is the isomorphism between $X$ and $\alpha$. The problem is, if this lemma is true, then this creates a lot of contradiction. For example, $\omega=\omega+1$. This is because $|\omega|=|\omega+1|$ and so (from this lemma) $\omega$ is isomorphic to $\omega+1$.

36,What does a one-to-one mapping say about the cardinality of the reals if it isn't onto?,What does a one-to-one mapping say about the cardinality of the reals if it isn't onto?,,"Cantor had shown that for any two subsets containing all numbers in $\mathbb{R}$ on any two intervals, they must have equal cardinalities because one can find a bijective function. The famous example is that the cardinality on the set of Reals in $[0, 1]$ is equal to the cardinality on the set of Reals on $[0, 2]$. The bijection for the two sets is to simply multiply any $x$ in the first set by 2, and you have found a bijection. Define $\mathbb{A} = \{x\in\mathbb{R}: 0 \leq x \leq 1\}$ and define $\mathbb{B} = \{x \in \mathbb{R}: 0 \leq x \leq 2\}$, then our function is simply $f: x \mapsto 2x$. What bugs me about this is that you can also find a mapping such that it is injective, but not surjective. We simply define our function as $f: x \mapsto x$. This function maps every element $\mathbb{A}$ to an element in $\mathbb{B}$, but there are still elements left over in $\mathbb{B}$ that don't have an element in $\mathbb{A}$ mapping to it. For finite sets, this would usually imply that $|\mathbb{B}| > |\mathbb{A}|$, ($\mathbb{B}$ is strictly larger than $\mathbb{A}$) but this doesn't seem to be the case for infinite sets. The argument for finite sets can be easily explained as a way to count without numbers. For example, if you and I have a bunch of rocks, and you want to see who has more, you can line them up, and see who has left over at the end. In the analogy, if I all of my rocks have a unique rock from your set next to it, the mapping is injective.

68,Cantor's diagonal argument modified version,Cantor's diagonal argument modified version,,"I have the following doubt regarding Cantor's diagonal argument. First of all, the ""usual case"" is quite clear for me. If $X$ is some set, then we can show there is no surjection from $X$ onto the set $\mathcal{F}(X;\{0,1\})$ of functions $f: X\to \{0,1\}$ by the following procedure: We consider $\varphi : X\to \mathcal{F}(X;\{0,1\})$ to be any function. It sufices to construct $f \in \mathcal{F}(X;\{0,1\})$ such that $f\notin \varphi(X)$. This can be done quite directly as $$f(x) = \begin{cases}1, & \text{if} \ \varphi(x)(x)=0, \\ 0, & \text{if} \ \varphi(x)(x)=1.\end{cases}$$ In that case, it is clear that $f(x)\neq\varphi(x)(x)$, so $f\neq \varphi(x)$ for any $x\in X$ and $\varphi$ is not surjective. Now, a slightly modified version I've found is: If $X$ is any non-empty set and $Y$ is a set with at least two elements, no function $\varphi : X \to \mathcal{F}(X;Y)$ is surjective. If $Y$ has at least two elements, we can label them $0_Y$ and $1_Y$. I've tried the same procedure, that is, let $\varphi : X\to \mathcal{F}(X;Y)$ be given and define $f : X\to Y$ by $$f(x) = \begin{cases}1_Y, & \text{if} \ \varphi(x)(x)=0_Y, \\0_Y, & \text{if} \ \varphi(x)(x)=1_Y.\end{cases}$$ But this is not well-defined. Indeed, since $Y$ has at least two elements, there can be more elements on $Y$. In that case, it could happen that $\varphi(x)(x)$ is neither $0_Y$ or $1_Y$ and in that case $f(x)$ is not well-defined. My workaround was the following: first of all, it is quite easy to notice that if $A$ and $B$ are non-empty sets and $X\subset B$ is non-empty, then if there is no surjection $f : A\to X$ there is also no surjection $g : A\to B$. In that case, we can see that $\mathcal{F}(X;\{0_Y,1_Y\})\subset \mathcal{F}(X;Y)$, so we can use the usual argument to conclude there is no surjection from $X$ onto $\mathcal{F}(X;\{0_Y,1_Y\})$ and use this to conclude the same for $\mathcal{F}(X;Y)$.

Method 1 Let: $$ \mathcal A=\{0,1,\dots,9\}\cup\{.\}\\ \mathbb{R}^{(0,1)}=\{x|0<x<1,x\in\mathbb{R}\} $$ then: $ \forall x \in \mathbb{R}^{(0,1)}$, $x$ can be writen in format of $0.231\dots$, so $ string\_of(x) \in \mathcal L$. So: $card(\mathcal L) \ge card(\mathbb{R}^{(0,1)}) = \aleph_1$ Method 2 We can arrange elements of $\mathcal L$ in aspect of string length: Let $\mathcal A=\{0,1,\dots,9\}$, $num\_of(string)$ is the decimal value of the $string$ $$ \mathcal{L} = \bigcup_{i=0}^\infty \mathcal{L}_i \\ \mathcal{L}_0 = \{string|string \in \mathcal L \land len(string)=0\} \\ \mathcal{L}_1 = \{string|string \in \mathcal L \land len(string)=1\} \\ \mathcal{L}_2 = \{string|string \in \mathcal L \land len(string)=2\} \\ \dots $$ And for each $\mathcal{L}_i$ can be arranged as: $$ \mathcal{L}_i=\{string_i^0, string_i^1,\dots,\dots,string_i^n\} \\ $$ where $n={\|\mathcal{A}\|^i},  \forall j,k,  0 \lt j \lt k \lt n, num\_of(string_i^j) \lt num\_of(string_i^k) $. so I can arrange all of $\mathcal{L}$'s element in order, which means $card(\mathcal{L}) \le \aleph_0$ I cannot figure out the mistake of these two methods, can anyone help me?

The question is, If the set $S$ has a finite number of elements then prove that if $\sigma$ maps from $S$ onto $S$, then $\sigma$ is one-to-one, and if $\sigma$ is one-to-one map from $S$ into $S$ , then show that $\sigma$ is onto. $\mathbf{Proof (in \space progress)}:$ Let $|S|=n$ and let $\sigma: S \to S$ be any mapping from $S$ into $S$.

I mean intuitively it seems to makes sense that since each $s \in S$ can only be mapped to one other $s \in S$, then it would hold, but I still feel a bit fuzzy on it. Moving on,  if $\sigma$ is onto then we have $|\sigma^{-1}(s)| \ge 1$ because each s must have at least one s if not more that maps to it. and from above, this gives, $$n=|S|=\sum_{s \in S} |\sigma^{-1}(s)| \ge \sum_{s \in S} 1=n$$ (because cardinality of S is n). And to assure the equality holds i.e. that n=n it forces that $| \sigma^{-1}(s)|=1$ for every $s \in S$ which therefor shows $\sigma$ is one-to-one and the converse is similar, that is, if $\sigma$ is one-to-one then  $|\sigma^{-1}(s)| \le 1$ for every $s \in S$ because of course if it was more than 1 , it would imply that more then one element in $S$ maps to the same element in $S$ which is directly against the definition of one-to-one. Which again will force us to have $| \sigma^{-1}(s)|=1$ for all $s \in S$, therefor showing that $\sigma$ is also onto.

I hope this can all help me to understand and work on my proofs better. Thanks everyone for the time! Update: Some of the comments have left me very curious about what methods I should be attempting.

Can you tell me what is wrong with my proof?! This is my proof: To prove that $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{R^2}$ both have same size, it's sufficient to show that there is a bijection between these two. consider $f : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R^2}$ which images each $x\in \mathbb{R}$ to $(x,0)$. this function is clearly one to one. Assume another function $g : \mathbb{R^2} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$.The function formula is this: give any $(x,y) \in \mathbb{R^2}$ . Write x and y by their standard decimal expansion (you can't use infinitely many 9 in expansion), so $(x,y)=(A_0A_1...A_n.a_0a_1...., B_0B_1...B_m.b_0b_1...)$ without loss of generalitty assume that $m\ < n$ . say $g(x,y)=A_0B_0A_1b_1...A_mB_mA_{m+1}...A_n.KFa_0b_0a_1b_1....$, which $K=0$ if x is positive and $K=1$ if x is not. and Also $F=0$ if y is positive and $ F=1$ if y is not. it's obvious that the function $g$ is one to one. so by using the Schroeder-Bernstein Theorem there is a bijection between $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{R^2}$.

98,Zorn's Lemma's chain condition,Zorn's Lemma's chain condition,,"Zorn's Lemma requires that every chain in a partially ordered set $X$ has an upper bound. In this article Gowers uses Zorn's Lemma to find a maximal linearly independent (over $\mathbb{Q}$) subset of $\mathbb{R}$. He does this by looking at the set of all linearly independent subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ with the partial order $\subset$. He checks that every chain has an upper bound by considering a collection $Y$ of nested linearly independent subsets of $\mathbb{R}$. He defines the upper bound as their union. Thus every chain has an upper bound and Zorn's lemma can show that a basis for $\mathbb{R}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ exists. But what if $Y$ is infinite? It's not too hard to think of a chain in this case that has no upper bound- just keep adjoining appropriately chosen irrational numbers to get another subset of $\mathbb{R}$ linearly independent over $\mathbb{Q}$. The chain of such subsets has no upper bound, right? In general, when you prove that every chain in $X$ has an upper bound, you need to consider finite and infinite chains, right? So how come Gowers, in paragraph 24 (below), implicitly assumed that $Y$ is a finite collection? Obviously it is easy to find the upper bound of a finite chain. All we have to do if we want to apply Zorn’s lemma is check that every chain has an upper bound. So let us imagine that we have a collection $Y$ of linearly independent subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ and that for any two of those sets one is contained in the other. What could serve as an upper bound? By definition it has to be a set that contains all the sets in $Y$, so it has to contain their union. We want it to be linearly independent, so the smaller it is, the better. So there is basically only one candidate to try: the union itself. Is the union linearly independent? Well, if $t_1,\dots,t_n$ belong to the union, then each $t_i$ belongs to some linearly independent set $L_i\in Y$. Because $Y$ is a chain, one of these sets $L_i$ contains all the others. If that is $L_j$, then the linear independence of $L_j$ implies that no non-trivial linear combination of $t_1,\dots,t_n$ can be zero, which proves that the union of the sets in $Y$ is linearly independent, just as we wanted.
