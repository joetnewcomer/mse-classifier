0,Nesting functions to understand nesting series,Nesting functions to understand nesting series,,"So I am working on a problem that involves an expression that has a ""nested"" sigma notation. Maybe ""nested"" isn't the correct word, because you start with an input (of your choosing) and the output becomes the input for the next iteration. So it's like a recursive sequence. I am almost positive that this has been studied before. Not because I've heard of it, but because it's too simple of an idea to not have been studied before. (I could be wrong.) If, instead of a series, we had a function, then this function ""nested"" 3 times would look like $f(f(f(x)))$. I am looking to generalize this to any type of function nested any number of times. To give a simple example of what I mean: if we have $f(x)=ax+b$, then, $f(x)$ ""nested"" $N$ times with starting value $X$ can be generalized as $$Xa^N+b((1-a^N)/(1-a))$$  If anybody can provide with generalizations (or links to generalizations) for trigonometric, exponential, quadratic, polynomial, etc. functions, like the one I have provided, it would be of most help. Thank you. EDIT: Also, if these types of generalizations have been made for series (in sigma notation would be even better) that would just be, as you say, ""icing on the cake"". :) Thanks.","So I am working on a problem that involves an expression that has a ""nested"" sigma notation.

1,Properties of $f(f(x))=g(x)$,Properties of,f(f(x))=g(x),"With reference to this Youtube video, I was trying to find out what important information we can gain from the equation $f(f(x))=g(x)$ [Assume all functions to be real] One particularly interesting one that I found was this: Consider $\text{Fix}(g)$ to be the set of all real numbers invariant under the map $g$ (which is to say that $\text{Fix}(g)=\{x:x\in\mathbb{R},g(x)=x\}$ ). Now, $$\begin{eqnarray} &&f(f(x))=g(x)\\ &\implies& f(f(f(x)))=f(g(x))\\ &\implies&g(f(x))=f(g(x)) \end{eqnarray}$$ This implies compositional commutativity of the 2 functions. Now for any arbitrary $x_0$ in $\text{Fix}(g)$ : $$\begin{eqnarray} &&g(f(x_0))=f(g(x_0))\\ &\implies& g(f(x_0))=f(x_0) \end{eqnarray}$$ So, $f(x_0)$ must also be in $\text{Fix}(g)$ , as it is invariant under $g$ . So, we can conclude that if $x_0$ is invariant under $g$ , then $f(x_0)$ will also be invariant under $g$ Similarly, we can also show that if $x_0$ is invariant under $f$ , then $g(x_0)$ is also invariant under $f$ .

3,"What is the exact function or algorithm Windows 10 is using to calculate taskbar underline color from Registry values, based on data I have collected?","What is the exact function or algorithm Windows 10 is using to calculate taskbar underline color from Registry values, based on data I have collected?",,"In earlier versions of Windows, it was easy for users to set the exact colors of interface elements. For example, in Windows 7, you could go to [Control Panel -> Personalization -> Window Color], which would bring up a dialog box letting you select specific interface elements and set the color for each of them. In Windows 10, much of that functionality was removed; you can go to [Settings -> Personalization -> Colors], but it will only let you choose an accent color as an overall theme, and the exact colors of interface elements are then all automatically calculated as variations from your accent color. However, as explained in such links as...: https://old.reddit.com/r/windows/comments/3fdwo5/how_to_change_your_accent_color_to_anything_you/ctnujt5 https://www.superuser.com/questions/1558106/color-of-active-window-in-windows-10-taskbar https://www.superuser.com/questions/1717690/make-active-window-more-obvious-on-taskbar-windows-10 ...it is possible to edit the Registry binary value HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Accent\AccentPalette to set the colors of elements of the Windows taskbar. To summarize the Reddit link and the results of my own experiments, AccentPalette consists of the bytes GG GG GG 00 HH HH HH 00 JJ JJ JJ 00 KK KK KK 00 LL LL LL 00 MM MM MM 00 NN NN NN 00 PP PP PP 00 These are RGB triplets delimited by a 00 null byte. Each RGB triplet is used by Windows to determine the color of a different element of the interface. These RGB triplets are generally applied to the interface without any modification to their value. For example, LL LL LL is used as the exact background color of the active taskbar button (the button in the taskbar corresponding to the active window), and MM MM MM is used as the exact background color of inactive taskbar buttons (buttons in the taskbar corresponding to inactive windows). The HH HH HH RGB triplet determines the color of the underline beneath taskbar buttons with an open window. The same underline color is used for all open windows, both active and inactive. That underline is a light blue line in the example images here (re-used from the Superuser questions above): The difficulty is that unlike the other RGB triplets, Windows 10 does not use this HH HH HH value without modification. If all three color components are greater than or equal to the hex value B3, then Windows uses the triplet as the color of the underline without modification, but if any of the three color components are less than B3, then Windows applies some sort of lightening blend/transformation to the triplet to get the final color. Let us designate the three color components (red, green, and blue) of this HH HH HH Registry AccentPalette triplet as $S_R$ , $S_G$ , and $S_B$ , and the three color components of the final taskbar underline color as $T_R$ , $T_G$ , and $T_B$ . My question is, based on the data below, what is the exact function or algorithm $f(S_R, S_G, S_B) = (T_R, T_G, T_B)$ of this blend/transformation? Based on the data below, how exactly does Windows 10 calculate the final taskbar underline RGB color from the HH HH HH triplet? Here is a table of data I have manually gathered by editing the Registry, restarting Explorer so that Windows 10 will apply the change, taking screenshots, and then using an image editor's eyedropper tool to determine the final resulting color. The values are all in hex.

But if any of the three color components are less than B3, then Windows applies some sort of lightening blend/transformation to the triplet to get the final color. The result is deterministic. The same S values always result in the same T values. The result is independent in the sense that it is not affected by any other triplets in the AccentPalette value. Any permutation applied to the S values results in the same permutation being applied to the T values. For example, if $f(S_1, S_2, S_3) = (T_1, T_2, T_3)$ , then $f(S_1, S_3, S_2) = (T_1, T_3, T_2)$ . That is, the red, green, and blue components are interchangeable in the sense that any of them can be swapped, and the same components will be swapped in the result. The mapping is many-to-one. One example from the table above is that if $S_R$ = 00 and $S_G$ = 00, then any value of $S_B$ from 01 to B3 will give the result value (75, 75, B3). That is, $f(00, 00, 01-B3) = (75, 75, B3)$ . The function might look linear at a glance within some ranges, but a closer examination shows it is not truly linear. For example, look in the table above at the results in the range $f(00, 00, B4-B7)$ . Within that range, $T_B$ is simply $S_B$ , but for $T_R$ and $T_G$ , it increments first from 75 to 76, but then stays at 76 for another step before incrementing again to 77. The function generally is fairly smooth, but it has some wild discontinuities. As seen in the table above, it is smooth-ish in the ranges $f(00, 00, B4-B7)$ and $f(00, 00, B9-BB)$ , but $f(00, 00, B8)$ gives a wild jump that is far from the values surrounding it.","In earlier versions of Windows, it was easy for users to set the exact colors of interface elements.

5,"What meaning should I assign to ""assign""?","What meaning should I assign to ""assign""?",,"Since a few days ago, I have been working with Schaum's Outline of General Topology by Seymour Lipschutz. So far I have been studying the first chapters about sets and functions to review, and to make sure that I know his notation. My question is more philosophical in nature, and would perhaps strike you as ""silly"" but I will pose it anyway, and would love to hear your thoughts! In chapter 2, he defines a function in this way (rather wordily): Suppose that to each element of a set $A$ there is assigned a unique element of a set $B$ ; the collection, $f$ , of such assignments is called a function from $A$ into $B$ ... (p.17, emphasis added) Very standard I guess, but what caught my attention was the word assign . What does it really mean to ""assign"" something to something else? Where (i.e., in what kind of set) is this assignment stored? My intuition about assignment was (and still is) that it is simply a pair of elements; i.e., an assignment of elements $a \in A$ to $b \in B$ is simply a subset of $A \times B$ . However, the (philosophical) problem comes from Lipschutz's next statement: To each function $f: A \rightarrow B$ there corresponds the relation in $A \times B$ given by $$\{ ( a,f(a) ) \vert a \in A\}.$$ (p.17, emphasis added) Thus to the function corresponds a relation, i.e., the function and the relation are seen as different objects. The problem is then metaphorically swept under the carpet by not ""distinguish[ing] between a function and its graph."" I interpret this a bit colorfully as ""they are different, but we are not supposed to ask questions about it."" I remember when I studied my first algebra course, then a function $f: A \rightarrow B$ was indeed defined as a special case of a relation, i.e., as a subset of $A \times B$ . I never thought much about it then, but now I see that doing it this way avoids any reference to some ""assignment"" and we know exactly which set the function ""lives in"" -- $A \times B$ , so we don't have to think about where the ""assignment"" is ""stored."" But by making a difference between the function and the relation (although there is a map between them, which is my interpretation of ""corresponds"") the (philosophical) question of the nature of this ""assignment"" arises (at least in my mind). I guess another way to phrase what I'm thinking about is that in my mind, ""assignment"" is done by means of a map, or function, between sets; but what does it mean then to define functions in terms of some ""assignment"" operation? I apologize in advance for taking up your time with this! (I feel so stupid for thinking about these kinds of things instead of actually working with the topology problems...). But I'm wondering if there is some definition or notion of what ""assignment"" means in this context? Or perhaps it is just some language that we shouldn't think more about? Or perhaps there is something I have missed, not being a native English speaker?

I remember when I studied my first algebra course, then a function was indeed defined as a special case of a relation, i.e., as a subset of . I never thought much about it then, but now I see that doing it this way avoids any reference to some ""assignment"" and we know exactly which set the function ""lives in"" -- , so we don't have to think about where the ""assignment"" is ""stored."" But by making a difference between the function and the relation (although there is a map between them, which is my interpretation of ""corresponds"") the (philosophical) question of the nature of this ""assignment"" arises (at least in my mind). I guess another way to phrase what I'm thinking about is that in my mind, ""assignment"" is done by means of a map, or function, between sets; but what does it mean then to define functions in terms of some ""assignment"" operation? I apologize in advance for taking up your time with this! (I feel so stupid for thinking about these kinds of things instead of actually working with the topology problems...). But I'm wondering if there is some definition or notion of what ""assignment"" means in this context? Or perhaps it is just some language that we shouldn't think more about? Or perhaps there is something I have missed, not being a native English speaker? If you have any insights I would love to hear them :)","A B f A B a \in A b \in B A \times B f: A \rightarrow B A \times B \{ ( a,f(a) ) \vert a \in A\}. f: A \rightarrow B A \times B A \times B","['functions', 'elementary-set-theory', 'definition']"

The question is all about mathematics, however the math behind this question came from a problem I had in web design. But since it's about math I am going to put it here. I'm currently diving into parallax effects on the web. Parallax scrolling is a technique in computer graphics and web design, where background images move by the camera slower than foreground images, creating an illusion of depth in a 2D scene and adding to the immersion.   ~ wikipedia In addition to just the foreground and background moving at a different pace moving elements in a different direction also has a parallax ish effect. ~ me Basically I want to create a little container (could be an image, or any block level element) and move it across the screen horizontally as the user scrolls. This can be done with JavaScript but how is not really the point of this question. The effect should be scalable across all viewports. Meaning that the hight and the width of the element that the element is moving across should not matter. When the user has scrolled half of the height of the screen the ""moving element"" should be in the exact center. Since the user will have scrolled half of the screen the element will be vertically already. We're only worried about horizontally right now. I've thought about this question for a while and came up with a pretty good idea of how. Take the hight and the width of the element you want the ""moving element"" to move across. For example a screen that is $1000\text{px}$ tall and $600\text{px}$ wide. Divide the width by the height. For example ($600\text{px} / 1000\text{px} = 3/5 = 0.6$) Take the amount of pixels the user scrolled and multiply it by the number we just created. For example ($500\text{px} \times 0.6 = 300\text{px}$). As you can see this is the exact center. Move the element across the screen by the amount of pixels just calculated. This calculation works fine even for every screen size, however it's linear. Meaning that the element will move at the same speed across the screen all the time. Let me show you what I mean. Let' draw out a screen size.... (Let's say $1000 \times 500$) Calculate two points for this graph -> screen factor: $(500 / 1000) = 0.5$ The first point is going to be easy. Let's say we scrolled exactly    $0\text{px}$ -> $(0.5 \times 0) = 0$ The ""Moving element"" will not have moved at all. For the second element we'll take the center. Just for convenience. The vertical center is at $500\text{px}$ -> $(0.5 \times 500) = 250\text{px}$ (Exactly the horizontal center) Put the results in a graph and draw a line through the points. (Consider the orange line) In the graph above you can see that whenever the user scrolls down the ""moving element"" will follow the line (the values on the horizontal-axis). My question I really hope I described all that well enough to understand. Now on to my question... What I want to create is a moving element that would go faster on the edge of the screen and slow down a bit in the middle. If we were to draw that out in the same way we just did (Creating a graph where we can take the amount of pixels scrolled and see where the element should be positioned horizontally) it would look like the blue line in the previous image . As you can see in this graph the ""moving element"" wouldn't be moving all that much in the middle of the graph. (I over did it a bit in my drawing but you get the general idea.) What I need is a mathematical function that takes three parameters (Screen height, width and the amount of pixels scrolled) and returns the horizontal position of the ""moving element"". My idea: My idea was to position the element in the dead center of the page and then to move it left and right (translations using css and JavaScript) based on how far there has been scrolled. The graph would look something like this: The (Hand drawn) graph above would be true for a screen that's $1000\times600\text{px}$ since the ""moving element"" translates $-300\text{px}$ when no scrolling has been done and $300\text{px}$ when $100\%$ has been scrolled. However I have no idea on how to create a mathematical function that would be true for every screen size. Edit from one of my comments down below: To be clear: the user controls the position of the object by scrolling down the page. I want to take the amount of pixels that the user has scrolled down and input that number into a function. This function will then calculate the exact position at which the object should be relative to it's original position (0;0). So if the user has scrolled 0px the position should be (-0.5 * Pagewidth; 0). If the user has scrolled halfway it should be (0;0) and if it's at the end it should be (0.5 * Pagewidth; 0) The function should ""slow down"" towards the center of the page.

Prove the following: (a) If $g \circ f$ is injective, then $f$ is injective. Proof. Assume that $f$ is not injective. Then there exists $a,b \in A$ such that $f(a) = f(b)$ and $ a \ne b$ . It follows that there is an $a,b \in A$ such that $g(f(a)) = g(f(b))$ but $a \ne b$ , demonstrating that $g$ is not injective. $\Box$ (b) If $g \circ f$ is surjective then $g$ is surjective. Proof. Assume that $g \circ f$ is surjective. Then for every $c \in C$ , there exists an $a \in A$ for which $g(f(a)) = c$ . Since $f$ is a function from $A$ to $B$ , for each $a \in A$ there is a unique $b \in B$ such that $f(a) = b$ . Consequently, there exists an element $b \in B$ such that $g(b) = c$ . Thus $g$ is surjective. $\Box$ Suppose that $g : B \to C$ is a function. (a) Show that $g$ is injective if and only if for any set $A$ and any two functions $f_1,f_2: A \to B$ one has $g \circ f_1 = g \circ f_2 \Rightarrow f_1 = f_2$ . Proof. Assume that $g$ is injective and $g(f_1(x)) = g(f_2(x))$ for each $x \in A$ . Injectivity yields $f_1(x) = f_2(x)$ , so $g$ is left cancellable. Now assume that $g \circ f_1 = g \circ f2$ implies $f_1 = f_2$ . Thus $g$ must be injective, otherwise we could find $f_1, f_2 : A \to B$ such that $f_1(x) \ne f_2(x).$ This completes the proof in both directions. $ \Box$ (b) Show that $g$ is surjective if and only if for any set $D$ and any two functions $h_1,h_2: C \to D$ one has $h_1 \circ g = h_2 \circ g \Rightarrow h_1 = h_2$ . Proof. Suppose that $g$ is surjective and $h_1(g(b)) = h_2(g(b))$ for some $b \in B$ . Then for every $c \in C$ there exists a $b \in B$ such that $g(b) = c.$ Now if $h_1(g(b)) = h_2(g(b))$ then $h_1(c) = h_2(c)$ and $h_1 = h_2$ , so $g$ is right cancellable. Now suppose that $g$ is not surjective. Then for all $b \in B$ , there exists at least one $c_0 \in C$ such that $g(b) \ne c_0$ . Let $D = \{m,n\}$ and define $h_1: C \to \{m,n\}$ by $h_1(c) = m$ and $h_2: C \to \{m,n\}$ by $h_2(c) = \left\{ \begin{array}{lr} m  : c \ne c_0\\n : c = c_0 \end{array}\right. $ .

This problem is taken from the 1986 Canada National Olympiad. I believe that I have proven via strong induction that the function $f$ obeys a simpler recursion from which part (A) follows, but is there a simpler closed-form expression for $f(n)$, e.g. involving logs and floor functions? Is the proof okay? Simplifying the Recursion Computing a few more terms in the sequence: $$\begin{align} n=1: &f(3)=f(3-f(2))+f(2-f(1))&=f(3-2)+f(2-1)&=2 \\ n=2: &f(4)=f(4-f(3))+f(3-f(2))&=f(4-2)+\color{blue}{f(3-2)}&=3 \\ n=3: &f(5)=f(5-f(4))+f(4-f(3))&=\color{blue}{f(5-3)}+f(4-2)&=4 \\ n=4: &f(6)=f(6-f(5))+f(5-f(4))&=\color{blue}{f(6-4)}+\color{blue}{f(5-3)}&=4 \\ n=5: &f(7)=f(7-f(6))+f(6-f(5))&=f(7-4)+\color{blue}{f(6-4)}&=4 \\ n=6: &f(8)=f(8-f(7))+f(7-f(6))&=f(8-4)+f(7-4)&=5 \\ n=7: &f(9)=f(9-f(8))+f(8-f(7))&=\color{blue}{f(9-5)}+f(8-4)&=6 \\ n=8: &f(10)=f(10-f(9))+f(9-f(8))&=\color{blue}{f(10-6)}+\color{blue}{f(9-5)}&=6 \\ n=9: &f(11)=f(11-f(10))+f(10-f(9))&=f(11-6)+\color{blue}{f(9-5)}&=7 \\ \end{align}$$ Function values are shown in blue when the corresponding function value in the line above has the same argument. This gives a simple guarantee that (A) is true. $f(8)$ is the first function value that does not have such a term when expanded. This avenue will not be pursued further. Further values (not shown) lead me to conjecture that values are repeated as many times as the greatest power of 2 that divides the number ($2$ is repeated once, 4 twice, and odd numbers do not appear to be repeated); otherwise, values ascend by $1$. This will be tested via strong induction, and will lead to a simpler recursion formula. To prove (A) formulate an Induction Hypothesis (IH) for positive integers $n$, suitable for use with strong induction. For all integers $m\le n$ such that $m=2^q-1,q\ge1$, have $f(m)=2^{q-1}$ For all integers $m \le n$ such that $m=2^q,q\ge1$, have $f(m)=2^{q-1}+1$ For all other integers $m\le n$ express $m=2^q+r,r<2^q-1$, then $f(m)=2^{q-1}+f(r+1)$ For all $3\le m\le n$, have $1<f(m)<m$ The IH is clearly true for the base cases $n=1,n=2$. When proving the inductive step by evaluating $f(n+1)$ via the recursion rule in (1), three cases must be considered.

Hence, ensuring agreement with the special cases for $n=1,n=2$, we have the following recursive definition for $f$: $$f(n)=\begin{cases}  2^{q-1},&\text{ if }n=2^q-1, q\ge1 \\  2^{q-1}+1,&\text{ else if } n=2^q, q\ge1 \\ 2^{q-1}+f(k+1),&\text{ else }n=2^q+k,1\le k<2^q-1,q\ge2   \end{cases}$$ This is equation (2) (I can't seem to place a label in-line). Part (A) If $n,n+1$ both fall into case 3 in equation (2), they can both be reduced without altering their difference. So eventually at least one of $n,n+1$ will reduce to either the form $2^q$ or $2^q-1$. $$\begin{align} &\color{blue}{(n,n+1)\mapsto(2^q-2,2^q-1):} \\ f(n+1)-f(n)&=f(2^q-1)-f(2^q-2) \\            &=2^{q-1}-2^{q-1} &=0 \\\\ &\color{blue}{(n,n+1)\mapsto(2^q-1,2^q):} \\ f(n+1)-f(n)&=f(2^q)-f(2^q-1) \\            &=(2^{q-1}+1)-2^{q-1} &=1 \\\\ &\color{blue}{(n,n+1)\mapsto(2^q,2^q+1):} \\ f(n+1)-f(n)&=f(2^q+1)-f(2^q) \\            &=(2^{q-1}+f(2))-(2^{q-1}+1) &=1  \end{align}$$ Part (B) By (2), we have: $$\begin{align} f(2047)=f(2^{11}-1)=2^{10}=1024 < 1025 \\ f(2048)=f(2^{11})=2^{10}+1=1025 \\ f(2049)=f(2^{11}+1)=2^{10}+f(2)=1024+2=1026 > 1025 \end{align}$$ Since $f$ is non-descending, $n=2048$ is the unique solution to $f(n)=1025$.","The function $f:\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{R}$ satisfies all of $$\begin{align}f(1)&=1, \\  f(2)&=2,\\ f(n + 2) &= f(n + 2 − f(n + 1)) + f(n + 1 − f(n)) \tag{1} \end{align}$$ Show that $0 \le f(n + 1) − f(n) \le 1 \tag{A}$ Find all $n$ for which $f(n) = 1025$. This problem is taken from the 1986 Canada National Olympiad. I believe that I have proven via strong induction that the function $f$ obeys a simpler recursion from which part (A) follows, but is there a simpler closed-form expression for $f(n)$, e.g. involving logs and floor functions? Is the proof okay? Simplifying the Recursion Computing a few more terms in the sequence: $$\begin{align} n=1: &f(3)=f(3-f(2))+f(2-f(1))&=f(3-2)+f(2-1)&=2 \\ n=2: &f(4)=f(4-f(3))+f(3-f(2))&=f(4-2)+\color{blue}{f(3-2)}&=3 \\ n=3: &f(5)=f(5-f(4))+f(4-f(3))&=\color{blue}{f(5-3)}+f(4-2)&=4 \\ n=4: &f(6)=f(6-f(5))+f(5-f(4))&=\color{blue}{f(6-4)}+\color{blue}{f(5-3)}&=4 \\ n=5: &f(7)=f(7-f(6))+f(6-f(5))&=f(7-4)+\color{blue}{f(6-4)}&=4 \\ n=6: &f(8)=f(8-f(7))+f(7-f(6))&=f(8-4)+f(7-4)&=5 \\ n=7: &f(9)=f(9-f(8))+f(8-f(7))&=\color{blue}{f(9-5)}+f(8-4)&=6 \\ n=8: &f(10)=f(10-f(9))+f(9-f(8))&=\color{blue}{f(10-6)}+\color{blue}{f(9-5)}&=6 \\ n=9: &f(11)=f(11-f(10))+f(10-f(9))&=f(11-6)+\color{blue}{f(9-5)}&=7 \\ \end{align}$$ Function values are shown in blue when the corresponding function value in the line above has the same argument. This gives a simple guarantee that (A) is true. $f(8)$ is the first function value that does not have such a term when expanded. This avenue will not be pursued further. Further values (not shown) lead me to conjecture that values are repeated as many times as the greatest power of 2 that divides the number ($2$ is repeated once, 4 twice, and odd numbers do not appear to be repeated); otherwise, values ascend by $1$. This will be tested via strong induction, and will lead to a simpler recursion formula. To prove (A) formulate an Induction Hypothesis (IH) for positive integers $n$, suitable for use with strong induction. For all integers $m\le n$ such that $m=2^q-1,q\ge1$, have $f(m)=2^{q-1}$ For all integers $m \le n$ such that $m=2^q,q\ge1$, have $f(m)=2^{q-1}+1$ For all other integers $m\le n$ express $m=2^q+r,r<2^q-1$, then $f(m)=2^{q-1}+f(r+1)$ For all $3\le m\le n$, have $1<f(m)<m$ The IH is clearly true for the base cases $n=1,n=2$. When proving the inductive step by evaluating $f(n+1)$ via the recursion rule in (1), three cases must be considered. Case 1: $n=2^q-2$ (IH.1 for $n+1$) $$\begin{align} &f(n+1)\\ &=f(2^q-1)\\ &=f(2^q-1-f(2^q-2))+f(2^q-2-f(2^q-3)) \\ &=f(2^q-1-f(2^{q-1}+(2^{q-1}-2))) + f(2^q-2-f(2^{q-1}+(2^{q-1}-3)))  \\ &=f(2^q-1-(2^{q-2}+f(2^{q-1}-1))) + f(2^q-2-(2^{q-2}+f(2^{q-1}-2)))&(\text{by IH.3}) \\ &=f(2^q-1-(2^{q-2}+2^{q-2}))) + f(2^q-2-(2^{q-2}+f(2^{q-1}-2)))&(\text{by IH.1}) \\ &=f(2^{q-1}-1) + f(2^q-2-(2^{q-2}+f(2^{q-2}+(2^{q-2}-2))))&(\text{algebra}) \\ &=2^{q-2} + f(2^q-2-(2^{q-2}+(2^{q-3}+f(2^{q-2}-1))))&(\text{IH.1, IH.3}) \\ &=2^{q-2} + f(2^q-2-(2^{q-2}+(2^{q-3}+2^{q-3})))&(\text{IH.1, IH.3}) \\ &=2^{q-2} + f(2^{q-2}+(2^{q-2}-2))&(\text{algebra}) \\ &=2^{q-2} + 2^{q-3}+f(2^{q-2}-1)&(\text{by IH.3}) \\ &=2^{q-2} + 2^{q-3}+ 2^{q-3} = 2^{q-1} &(\text{by IH.1}) \\ &\implies\text{IH.1 for }n+1=2^q-1  \end{align}$$ and $1 < 2^{q-1} < 2^q-1 \implies$ IH.4 for $n+1$.
