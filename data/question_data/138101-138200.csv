I assume this is a consequence of the FTC, but I don't quiet see it. If I integrate on both sides I get $$\frac{dy}{dx}=f(x)\implies \int \frac{d}{dx}y(x)dx=\int f(x)dx$$ at this point to apply the FTC I have to make an assumption about the interchangeability of the integral and derivative operators, which hopefully only requires $\frac{d}{dx}y(x)$ to be integrable, I am not sure but willing to overlook that part for now.

Consider an ordinary autonomous differential equation where the dependent variable $x$ is defined on the real line, i.e. $$\dot{x} = f(x),$$ where $x \in \mathbb{R}$, and the dot is differentiation with respect to time $t$. It is known that the corresponding phase portrait has solutions that are equilibria, and all other solutions either move towards $\pm \infty$, or towards / away from the equilibria. Geometrically, if we draw the phase portrait, we only can have equilibria and all other trajectories move right or left. No periodic solutions exist. So what about nonautonomous ode like $$\dot{x}=\cos t.$$ The general solution is $x(t)=\sin t - \sin t_{0} +x_{0}$.  It is clear that all solutions are periodic.

I am quite sure a complete characterisation will be very hard, but I'm looking for partial results as well. Clearly, if $P$ has one term, then $P$ has to have odd degree, since the degree of the right handed side is odd. The following example shows that in fact all such polynomials with positive coefficients work: We see that $Q(x)=\sqrt{\dfrac{m}{n}}x^n$ gives $Q'(x)=\sqrt{mn}x^{n-1}$ gives $ Q(x)Q'(x)=mx^{2n-1}$. If we require $Q$ to have real coefficients then this only works for $m>0$.
