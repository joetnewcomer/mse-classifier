What is the idea behind this horizontal integration? I read Lebesgue integral basics a possible answer but still I can't figured out a completely clear explanation.

The integral seems quite problematic to me. If the limits were finite, I would do this: $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{x^4+a^4}+\sqrt{x^4+b^4}}=\frac{1}{a^4-b^4}(\sqrt{x^4+a^4}-\sqrt{x^4+b^4})$$ Then, for one of the integrals we will have: $$\int_A^B \sqrt{x^4+a^4} dx=a^3 \int_{A/a}^{B/a} \sqrt{1+t^4} dt$$ This integral is complicated, but quite well known. On the other hand $\int_0^\infty \sqrt{1+t^4}dt$ diverges, so I can't consider the two terms separately. But the integral behaves like I can! If we look at the final expression, it seems like $\int_0^\infty \sqrt{1+t^4}dt=\frac{\Gamma(1/4)^2 }{6 \sqrt{\pi}}$ even though it can't be correct. I have to somehow arrive at Beta function, since we have a squared Gamma as an answer. I'm interested in this integral, since it represents another kind of mean for two numbers $a$ and $b$. If we scale it appropriately: $$I(a,b)=\frac{8 \sqrt{\pi}}{\Gamma(1/4)^2 } \int_0^\infty \frac{dx}{\sqrt{x^4+a^4}+\sqrt{x^4+b^4}}= \frac{4}{3} \frac{a^2+ab+b^2}{a^3+ab(a+b)+b^3}$$ So, $1/I(a,b)$ is a mean for the two numbers.","Turns out this integral has a very nice closed form: $$\int_0^\infty \frac{dx}{\sqrt{x^4+a^4}+\sqrt{x^4+b^4}}=\frac{\Gamma(1/4)^2 }{6 \sqrt{\pi}} \frac{a^3-b^3}{a^4-b^4}$$ I found it with Mathematica, but I can't figure out how to prove it. The integral seems quite problematic to me. If the limits were finite, I would do this: $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{x^4+a^4}+\sqrt{x^4+b^4}}=\frac{1}{a^4-b^4}(\sqrt{x^4+a^4}-\sqrt{x^4+b^4})$$ Then, for one of the integrals we will have: $$\int_A^B \sqrt{x^4+a^4} dx=a^3 \int_{A/a}^{B/a} \sqrt{1+t^4} dt$$ This integral is complicated, but quite well known. On the other hand $\int_0^\infty \sqrt{1+t^4}dt$ diverges, so I can't consider the two terms separately. But the integral behaves like I can!

While knowing $f(u)$ exactly would be nice, I'd be quite happy with just $I=\int_{0}^\infty f(u)du$ or an approximation to $I$ ! My goal would be an approximation within $1$ %. I have two attempts below - one with an ansatz for $f(u)$ and the other a perturbative series for $I$ . I'm hopeful that either direction will be fruitful. Here's a sketch of my attempt that roughly estimates $I \approx .6$ . First, note that a problem with different bounds and with $u$ between $\infty$ and $\infty$ , $$\frac{\pi}{2}g(u) = \frac{1}{1+u^2} - \int_{\color{red}{-\infty}}^\infty \frac{g(v) dv}{4+(u-v)^2}$$ can be solved via Fourier transform to find $g(u) = \frac{1}{e^{\frac{\pi}{2}u}+e^{-\frac{\pi}{2}u}}$ and $\int_{0}^\infty g(u) du = \frac{1}{2}$ . I anticipate that $I$ for the problem of interest will be a little more than $.5$ , given that it appears we're subtracting less from the right hand side when we use smaller bounds. Consider the ansatz $$f(u) = \frac{c_1}{e^{\frac{c_2 \pi}{2}u}+e^{-\frac{c_2\pi}{2}u}}$$ Changing the parameters $c_1$ and $c_2$ by hand, I find with numerical integration that $c_1=1.11$ and $c_2=.93$ make the left hand side and right hand side of $$\frac{\pi}{2}f(u) = \frac{1}{1+u^2} - \int_{0}^\infty \frac{f(v) dv}{4+(u-v)^2}$$ nearly equal as a function of $u$ . I anticipate this ansatz won't include the exact solution, but it gives what I think is a reasonable estimate for $I$ of about $.6$ . Here is another attempt. Note that these linear problems can in principle be solved through perturbative solutions; $$f(u) = h(u)+\lambda \int_0^\infty K(u,v) f(v)$$ is solved by $$f(u) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \lambda^n \int_0^\infty du_2 ... \int_0^\infty du_{n+1} K(u, u_2)...K(u_n, u_{n+1}) h(u_{n+1})$$ so $$I = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \lambda^n \int_0^\infty du_1 \int_0^\infty du_2 ... \int_0^\infty du_{n+1} K(u_1, u_2)...K(u_n, u_{n+1}) h(u_{n+1}).$$ That is, we have $$I = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \left(-\frac{2}{\pi}\right)^n \frac{2}{\pi} \int_0^\infty du_1 ... \int_0^\infty du_{n+1} \frac{1}{4+(u_1-u_2)^2}...\frac{1}{4+(u_n-u_{n+1})^2}\frac{1}{1+u_{n+1}^2}$$ The first few partial sums are $1, 0.318, 0.866$ . Assuming the terms are decreasing in the series, the alternating sum is then bounded between $0.318<I<0.866$ . This is consistent with $I\approx.6$ , but the bounds are quite large, and the integrals rapidly become both analytically and computationally challenging to evaluate.","I'm looking for where is the solution to the integral equation for between and .

The first approach aswell as the last one resulted in an infinite double summation. My knowledge about double sums, especially their evaluation, is quite weak.

Of course, the first three are special cases of $I_{3}$ , but I thought it would be best to tackle the easier cases first before moving to the fully general case in case different techniques are needed. Motivation. The beta function can be written in the form $$ \frac{\Gamma(a)\Gamma(b)}{\Gamma(a+b)} = \int_{0}^{1}t^{a-1}(1-t)^{b-1}\,\mathrm{d}t. $$ From here, it is straightforward to compute integrals of the type $$ \int_{0}^{1}x^{a}(1-x)^{b}\ln^{m}x\ln^{n}(1-x)\,\mathrm{d}x $$ through various series expansions or derivatives of the beta function. Thus one is not afraid of any powers on the logarithms, as one merely has to keep enough terms in the expansion, or compute enough derivatives. Attempt at $I_{0}$ . The presence of $1+x$ as a power and in the logarithm means that one cannot use the beta function directly. I am able to get away with it with the integral $I_{0}$ for now by shifting the boundaries and proceeding as $$\begin{aligned} \int_{0}^{1}(1+x)^{a+\epsilon}\,\mathrm{d}x &= \sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\frac{\epsilon^{m}}{m!}\int_{0}^{1}(1+x)^{a}\ln^{m}(1+x)\,\mathrm{d}x \\ &= \int_{1}^{2}x^{a+\epsilon}\,\mathrm{d}x = \frac{2^{a+1+\epsilon} - 1}{a+1+\epsilon} = \frac{2^{a+1}e^{\epsilon\ln 2} - 1}{a+1+\epsilon} \end{aligned}$$ and keeping the appropriate order coefficient by expanding the exponential in its Taylor series and the denominator in a power series. For example, $$\begin{aligned} \int_{0}^{1}(1+x)^{1+\epsilon}\,\mathrm{d}x &= \sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\frac{\epsilon^{m}}{m!}\int_{0}^{1}(1+x)\ln^{m}(1+x)\,\mathrm{d}x = \frac{4e^{\epsilon\ln 2} - 1}{2+\epsilon} \\ &\approx \left[4\left(1 + \epsilon\ln 2 + \frac{1}{2}\ln^{2}2\,\epsilon^{2}\right) - 1\right]\frac{1}{2}\left(1 - \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon^{2}}{4}\right) \\ &\approx \frac{1}{2}\left(3 + 4\ln 2\,\epsilon + 2\ln^{2}2\,\epsilon^{2}\right)\left(1 - \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon^{2}}{4}\right) \end{aligned}$$ so if one requires the $\epsilon^{2}$ coefficient, he merely keep all the terms, multiply by $2! = 2$ to account for the factorial in the original expansion, and arrive at $$ \int_{0}^{1}(1+x)\ln^{2}(1+x)\,\mathrm{d}x = \frac{3}{4} - 2\ln 2 + 2\ln^{2}2 $$ with the integrals $$ \int_{0}^{1}(1+x)\ln(1+x)\,\mathrm{d}x = -\frac{3}{4} + 2\ln 2 \quad\text{and}\quad \int_{0}^{1}(1+x)\,\mathrm{d}x = \frac{3}{2}$$ found for ""free"" if we were not lazy with the multiplication. So we have a method for doing $I_{0}$ for any powers desired. Attempts at $I_{1}$ . The above technique does not seem to generalize to the other integrals. For example, I am currently trying to derive the result $$ \int_{0}^{1}x(1+x)\ln^{2}x\ln(1+x)\,\mathrm{d}x = -\frac{1}{4}\zeta(3) + \frac{4}{27}\ln 2 - \frac{5}{36}\zeta(2) + \frac{37}{72} \tag{1}$$ and many other integrals of a similar form. (Edit: a method for $(1)$ has been found, see $(2)$ below) $$ \int_{0}^{1}(1+x)\ln x\ln^{2}(1+x)\,\mathrm{d}x = -\frac{1}{8}\zeta(3) + 5\ln 2 - 2\ln^{2}2 + \frac{1}{4}\zeta(2) - \frac{23}{8} \tag{2}$$ The class of integrals represented by $I_{1}$ seem difficult, as the zeta functions are familiar from the beta function, the $\ln 2$ is familiar from the treatment of $I_{0}$ , but how an answer like this combines these constants is elusive. Hypergeometric functions seem out of reach, as I seem to lose information about the answer from the Pochhammer symbols. To demonstrate this, one may derive from the Euler integral representation of ${}_{2}F_{1}$ $$\begin{aligned} \int_{0}^{1}x^{\epsilon}(1+x)^{\delta}\,\mathrm{d}x &= \frac{1}{1+\epsilon}\,{}_{2}F_{1}(-\delta, 1+\epsilon; 2+\epsilon; -1) \\ \int_{0}^{1}(1-x)^{\epsilon}(1+x)^{\delta}\,\mathrm{d}x &= \frac{1}{1+\epsilon}\,{}_{2}F_{1}(-\delta, 1; 2+\epsilon; -1) \\  \int_{0}^{1}x^{\epsilon}(1-x)^{\delta}(1+x)^{\lambda}\,\mathrm{d}x &= \frac{\Gamma(1+\epsilon)\Gamma(1+\delta)}{\Gamma(2+\delta+\epsilon)}\,{}_{2}F_{1}(-\lambda, 1+\epsilon; 2+\delta+\epsilon; -1). \end{aligned}$$ To take the first one as an example, we can write this expression as $$ \frac{1}{1+\epsilon}\,{}_{2}F_{1}(-\delta, 1+\epsilon; 2+\epsilon; -1) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{k}}{k!}\frac{(-\delta)_{k}}{1+k+\epsilon} = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}{\delta\choose k}\frac{1}{1+k+\epsilon}.$$ Thus one can use power series again to find the desired coefficient of $\epsilon$ , but the $(-\delta)_{k}$ makes things difficult. If we wanted to find the coefficient of $\epsilon\delta^{2}$ , for example as needed in $(2)$ , we would need to sum up an infinite series, since every term $k \geq 2$ will contribute to this coefficient. This particular series does numerically converge to the correct answer, but I cannot find a way to relate it to well-known constants such as $\zeta(3)$ and $\ln 2$ . I have also searched up some other integrals of similar forms on this site, and have found that many of the answers proceed with pages of horrendous algebra involving double series, harmonic numbers, etc. which I would like to avoid if possible as I am not very familiar with manipulating harmonic numbers as they appear in series. Of course, I will accept manipulations of harmonic numbers, etc. if it is the only straightforward way to proceed. Lastly, the references below may be of some use.

87,Computing the volume of a region on the unit $n$-sphere,Computing the volume of a region on the unit -sphere,n,"I would like to compute the surface volume of a region on the unit $n-1$-sphere: $$\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2  = 1,$$ bounded by an ellipsoid $$\sum_{i=1}^n a_ix_i^2 \leq a_2,$$ where $1=a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n$. A couple nice properties are that The region is symmetric across each axis, so I need only worry about computing the volume in one orthant and then multiply by $2^n$, and the limits of integration are somewhat easy to compute. My approach so far has been to use Cartesian coordinates ($n$-spherical seemed a bit too daunting with all the powers of sines): $$\int_0^{\ell_2} dx_2 \int_0^{\ell_3(x_2)} dx_3 \dots \int_0^{\ell_n(x_2,\dots,x_{n-1})} \frac{dx_n}{\sqrt{(1-x_2^2-\dots - x_n^2)}},$$ where $\ell_2 = 1$, $\ell_3(x_2) = \sqrt{\frac{(a_2-a_1) - (a_2-a_1)x_2^2}{a_3-a_1}}$, $\ell_4(x_2, x_3) = \sqrt{\frac{(a_2-a_1) - (a_2-a_1)x_2^2 - (a_3-a_1)x_3^2}{a_4-a_1}}$, and so on, so $\ell_i(x_2, \dots, x_{i-1}) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{a_i-a_1}\left((a_2-a_1) - \sum_{j=2}^{i-1}(a_j-a_1)x_j^2\right)}$. The problem for me is that as soon as I compute the most internal integral, I get a rather nasty formula involving arcsin: $$\sin^{-1}\left(\sqrt{\frac{(a_2-a_1) - \sum_{j=2}^{n-1}(a_j-a_1)x_j^2}{(a_n-a_1)(1-\sum_{j=2}^{n-1}x_j^2)}}\right)$$ Since this is the innermost formula, I don't even know where to go from here. Playing tricks with the trig doesn't seem to help either. My questions are: Is there a better way to attack this? Is it even possible to get a solution in terms of the $a_i$? Is there an approximation to the value of the integral that I can work out in terms of the $a_i$ (perhaps with $O()$-notation)? I should also note that $n$ could easily be extremely large (on the order of thousands or millions), so I'd need a very general way to attack this problem.","I would like to compute the surface volume of a region on the unit $n-1$-sphere: $$\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2  = 1,$$ bounded by an ellipsoid $$\sum_{i=1}^n a_ix_i^2 \leq a_2,$$ where $1=a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n$.

Moreover, you know the boundary condition $f(-1) = f(1) = 0 \qquad(3)$ (Dirichlet B.C.). Expression (1) has a form of energetic functional which can be discretized to the generalized eigenvalue problem (GEP): $F(f) = \displaystyle\frac{\langle f, \mathbf{X} f \rangle}{\langle f, \mathbf{R} f \rangle} = \frac{W(f)}{P(f)}, \qquad(4)$ where $\mathbf{R}$ and $\mathbf{X}$ are square $(N \times N)$ symmetric matrices. Some of you probably know the Method of moments in electrodynamics, where the resultant impedance matrix is $\mathbf{Z} = \mathbf{R} + \jmath \mathbf{X}$. Problem is ,that the GEP (4) says that there is a function $f_0(x)$ in natural resonance for which the numerator and denumerator in (1) are: $W(f_0) = 0$ and $P(f_O) = \max $, respectively.

Functional (5) is derived from Maxwell theory, Electric Field Integral Equation (EFIE), Poynting and some other theorems. We tested it numerically with great success. If we stress the region $\Omega$ to straight thin-wire (1D object) and define as yet-unknown function $\mathbf{J} = I(x) \delta(y) \delta(z) \, \mathbf{x}_0 \sim f(x),\qquad(6)$ where $\delta$ is delta function and $\mathbf{x}_0$ is unit vector pointing in $x$-direction, then according to the definition of divergence $\displaystyle \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} = \frac{\partial _k J_k} {\partial_k x_k} = \frac{\partial I(x)}{\partial x}\,\delta (y)\,\delta (z),\qquad (7)$ from (6) we have $\displaystyle \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} = \frac{\partial I(x)}{\partial x} \delta(y) \delta(z) \sim \frac{\partial f(x)}{\partial x},\qquad(8)$.
