0,Minimum transactions to settle debts among friends,Minimum transactions to settle debts among friends,,"You are given $n$ integers $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n$ satisfying $\sum_{i=1}^n x_i=0$ . A legal move is to choose an integer $a$ and two indices $i,j$ , and to increase $x_i$ by $a$ and decrease $x_j$ by $a$ . The goal is to have $x_1=x_2=\dots=x_n=0$ . What is an algorithm which achieves this goal in the fewest number of moves? There is an algorithm which always takes $n-1$ moves; at the $i^{th}$ step, decrease $x_i$ by $x_i$ and increase $x_{i+1}$ by $x_i$ . This is not always optimal, because if half of the $x_i$ equal $1$ and the other half equal $-1$ , then $n/2$ moves suffice.

2,Avoiding exactly one permutation pattern,Avoiding exactly one permutation pattern,,"Let $n \geq k$.  We say that a permutation $\sigma \in S_n$ contains a permutation (or ""pattern"") $\tau \in S_k$ if there is a substring of $k$ (not necessarily consecutive) elements of $\sigma$ ordered like $\tau$.  For example, the permutation $\sigma=24513$ contains $132$, since the string $243$ in $\sigma$ has the same relative order as $132$. Similarly, it contains $123$ (the string $245$), $213$ (the string $213$), $231$ (the string $451$) and $312$ (the string $513$).  The only length-$3$ pattern it does not contain is $321$. Question: Given a permutation $\tau \in S_k$, is it possible to find a value of $n$ and a permutation $\sigma \in S_n$ such that $\sigma$ contains every pattern of length $k$ except $\tau$? Overly Ambitious Generalization: Given a permutation $\sigma \in S_n$ and a $k \leq n$, let $T_k(\sigma)$ be the set of patterns of length $k$ contained in $\sigma$.  For a fixed integer $k$, what sets of patterns can possibly appear as $T_k(\sigma)$ for some $\sigma$? For large $k$, almost all subsets do not ever occur as a $T_k(\sigma)$.  One way to see this: By Erdős–Szekeres every permutation with $n>(k-1)^2$ contains either $123\dots k$ or $k\dots 321$.  There's less than $(k^2)!$ other choices for $\sigma$, each of which contains at most $\binom{k^2}{k}$ patterns.   So at most $\binom{k^2}{k} (k^2)!$ subsets containing neither $123\dots k$ nor $k \dots 321$ ever appear as a $T_k$, which is much smaller than the total number of subsets not containing those two patterns. The first question arose out of a discussion I had with a computer science graduate student about the complexity of testing for pattern containment.  Most of the work I've seen on pattern-avoiding permutations has focused more on enumerating them, and I'd appreciate any references to other work done on relationships between various pattern containments.","Let $n \geq k$.

22,New way to obtain partial continued fractions of square roots?,New way to obtain partial continued fractions of square roots?,,"Some background: I was working on a problem that asked for the sum of the cubes of the roots of a cubic, $x^3 - 5x^2 + 5x - 1$ .

After finding the sum of the cubes of them, I re-checked my work by manually cubing the roots and adding them together. While I was looking at the powers of $2 + \sqrt{3}$ , I noticed that the integer component of the sum approached the same value as the irrational component. For example, $(2 + \sqrt{3})^3 = 26 + 15\sqrt{3} = \sqrt{676} + \sqrt{675}$ , which is way closer than $2$ and $\sqrt{3}$ are. Moreover, when I looked at the powers of more expressions of the form $a + \sqrt{b}$ , where $a$ and $b$ were integers and $b$ was not a perfect square, I noticed that when $a = \lfloor \sqrt{b} \rfloor$ , the quotient of the coefficients of the rational and irrational terms after simplification is equal to a partial sum of the infinite fraction of $\sqrt{b}$ . For example, the continued fraction of $\sqrt{2}$ is $$1 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cdots}}}}$$ and the first few partial fractions are $$1, \frac{3}{2}, \frac{7}{5}, \frac{17}{12}, \frac{41}{29}, \cdots$$ Let $p_{a\sqrt{b}}$ denote the $a^{\text{th}}$ partial sum of the infinite fraction of $\sqrt{b}$ . Looking at the powers of $1 + \sqrt{2}$ , and letting $r_{c}$ be the ratio of the coefficients of the rational and irrational terms (i.e. $r_{c} = \frac{\text{coefficient}_{\text{rational}}}{\text{coefficient}_{\text{irrational}}}$ ), we find \begin{align*}&(1 + \sqrt{2})^1 = 1 + 1\sqrt{2} \Rightarrow r_{c} = \frac{1}{1} = 1 = p_{1\sqrt{2}}\\ &(1 + \sqrt{2})^2 = 3 + 2\sqrt{2} \Rightarrow r_{c} = \frac{3}{2} = p_{2\sqrt{2}} \\ &(1 + \sqrt{2})^3 = 7 + 5\sqrt{2} \Rightarrow r_{c} = \frac{7}{5} = p_{3\sqrt{2}} \end{align*} etc. This pattern also appears to hold for other values of $b$ , as long as $a = \lfloor \sqrt{b} \rfloor$ . For example, the continued fraction of $\sqrt{5}$ is $$2 + \cfrac{1}{4 + \cfrac{1}{4 + \cfrac{1}{4 + \cfrac{1}{4 + \cdots}}}}$$ and the first few partial fractions are $$2, \frac{9}{4}, \frac{38}{17}, \frac{161}{72}, \frac{682}{305}, \cdots$$ Looking at the powers of $2 + \sqrt{5}$ , we have \begin{align*}&(2 + \sqrt{5})^1 = 2 + 1\sqrt{5} \Rightarrow r_{c} = \frac{2}{1} = 2 = p_{1\sqrt{5}}\\ &(2 + \sqrt{5})^2 = 9 + 4\sqrt{2} \Rightarrow r_{c} = \frac{9}{4} = p_{2\sqrt{5}} \\ &(2 + \sqrt{5})^3 = 38 + 17\sqrt{5} \Rightarrow r_{c} = \frac{38}{17} = p_{3\sqrt{5}} \end{align*} Does this method actually work for all possible $b$ , and if so, has anyone else catalogued this yet? As someone who pursues math for fun, I find this to be a very interesting result! Also, would there be an elegant way to prove that $r_c$ approaches $\sqrt{b}$ as $n$ , the exponent, increases to infinity?

Math people: In an attempt to solve a larger problem, I defined a function $\sigma$ as follows: if $(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$ is a finite sequence of distinct real numbers, then  $\sigma(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) = 1$ if $(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$ is an even permutation of an increasing sequence, and $\sigma(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) = -1$ if $(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$ is an odd permutation of an increasing sequence.  Does this function have a name?  I Googled ""parity of a finite sequence"" and found nothing.  I found plenty on the parity of a permutation, but $(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$ is not a permutation.  Note that $n$ can be any positive integer.  The function is defined, and I need to define it, only for finite sequences of distinct real numbers. An example of an increasing sequence is $(1, 2, 4, 7, 10)$.  The numbers $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ are distinct, so there is exactly one increasing sequence you can form using all of them exactly once.

I'm asking this just to satisfy my own curiosity and maybe learn some useful things from combinatorics. There's many ways to model the problem, but let's use balls and urns: Let's say that you have 4 distinguishable urns (let's call them $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$) and 15 balls of 4 distinguishable types (let's call them $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$) such that you have 4 balls of each of $(a, b, c)$ and 3 $d$ balls. As you can see, one (natural) way of placing the balls in the urns is putting the four a's in A, the four b's in B, and so on. So far so good. Now here's the complication I don't know how to deal with: let's assume that the four urns have a fixed capacity to hold a maximum of four balls. So, you can notice that no matter how you divide the balls in the urns, there will always be 3 urns completely full, and one with a single ""empty"" space. The question is, how many different ways are there to divide the balls in the urns? There's a number in the URL I referenced in the first paragraph, and I guess I could verify it by writing a program to do it by brute force, but I'd like to know if there's a way to tackle this purely with mathematical reasoning. In addition, how about if we generalize the problem?

Edit 1: In case it helps, here's a few more details. As you can gather from the link, this problem is somewhat related to the 15-puzzle . Think of the urns as the rows in the puzzle. Think of the balls as the tiles with the numbers 1 to 15.

48,Explanation/Intuition behind why $C_n$ counts the number of triangulations of a convex $n+2$-gon?,Explanation/Intuition behind why  counts the number of triangulations of a convex -gon?,C_n n+2,"I was reading about the Catalan numbers on wikipedia, because it seems like they show up quite a bit. I'm reading some of the examples in the applications to combinatorics section. Some of them make sense fairly easily for me. For example, I see that the number of ways to parenthesize a product of $n+1$ terms $x_0,x_1,\dots, x_n$ is $C_n$, since the final multiplication $\cdot$ based on the parentheses must show up between two factors $x_k$ and $x_{k+1}$, and the way to parenthesize those terms $x_0,\dots,x_k$ and $x_{k+1},\dots,x_n$ are $C_k$ and $C_{n-k-1}$, respectively . Since this final $\cdot$ could show up anywhere, I get the recurrence $$ C_n=C_0C_{n-1}+C_1C_{n-2}+\cdots +C_{n-1}C_0 $$ which is the same as the Catalan numbers, given that the initial conditions are the same. In the same way, I see that the number of binary rooted trees with $n+1$ leaves is also given by $C_n$, since a binary tree essentially determines a parenthesization of a product of $n+1$ leaves if two leaves are enclosed in parentheses if they have the same parent node, and you follow the tree from the leaves up. I also understand the way it counts monotonic paths not passing the diagonal, as the first time a path touches the diagonal is like the position of the final multiplication on a product of $n$ terms, and splits the product into two smaller, but essentially similar subcases. But how does triangulating an $n+2$-gon give the same counting situation? I figured if you choose a vertex and draw a triangle with it as one of the vertices, it should give two other polygons that should suggest a recurrence relation like the one above, just like the Catalan numbers. Could someone point it out, or possibly show a way to relate it to one of the other identical counting situations which I understood? I don't quite see how this situation is the same. Thanks.","I was reading about the Catalan numbers on wikipedia, because it seems like they show up quite a bit. I'm reading some of the examples in the applications to combinatorics section. Some of them make sense fairly easily for me. For example, I see that the number of ways to parenthesize a product of $n+1$ terms $x_0,x_1,\dots, x_n$ is $C_n$, since the final multiplication $\cdot$ based on the parentheses must show up between two factors $x_k$ and $x_{k+1}$, and the way to parenthesize those terms $x_0,\dots,x_k$ and $x_{k+1},\dots,x_n$ are $C_k$ and $C_{n-k-1}$, respectively . Since this final $\cdot$ could show up anywhere, I get the recurrence $$ C_n=C_0C_{n-1}+C_1C_{n-2}+\cdots +C_{n-1}C_0 $$ which is the same as the Catalan numbers, given that the initial conditions are the same. In the same way, I see that the number of binary rooted trees with $n+1$ leaves is also given by $C_n$, since a binary tree essentially determines a parenthesization of a product of $n+1$ leaves if two leaves are enclosed in parentheses if they have the same parent node, and you follow the tree from the leaves up. I also understand the way it counts monotonic paths not passing the diagonal, as the first time a path touches the diagonal is like the position of the final multiplication on a product of $n$ terms, and splits the product into two smaller, but essentially similar subcases. But how does triangulating an $n+2$-gon give the same counting situation? I figured if you choose a vertex and draw a triangle with it as one of the vertices, it should give two other polygons that should suggest a recurrence relation like the one above, just like the Catalan numbers. Could someone point it out, or possibly show a way to relate it to one of the other identical counting situations which I understood? I don't quite see how this situation is the same.

49,Explanation of all the incomplete details on Apery's theorem proof following van der Poorten article.,Explanation of all the incomplete details on Apery's theorem proof following van der Poorten article.,,"I'm trying to fully understand Apery's proof of the irrationality of $\zeta(3)$ and after looking for a good source I ended up reading van der Poorten article A Proof that Euler missed... I think that the paper is really well explained but, at same points, it omits too many details (at least for me), so I'm going to state all my doubts the best way I can, and I hope that together with these other posts, if I get good answers, it can be a good source for anyone looking for details related with this paper. Section 3 Posts with some omited details in secction 3. Convergence of the sum $\sum_{k=1}^{N} \frac{(-1)^k}{(2k^3) \binom{N+k}{k} \binom {N}{k}}$ Proof that $\sum_{k=1}^\infty\frac{a_1a_2\cdots a_{k-1}}{(x+a_1)\cdots(x+a_k)}=\frac{1}{x}$ Section 4 In section 4 is defined the principal sequence of the proof, that is for $k \leq n$ $$c_{n,k}=\sum_{m=1}^n \dfrac{1}{m^3}+\sum_{m=1}^k \dfrac{(-1)^{m-1}}{2 m^3 {n\choose m}{n+m\choose m}}$$ It can be easily seen using the answer in the firts post I mentioned before that it converges uniformly in $k$ to $\zeta(3)$ , that is: Given $\varepsilon >0$ there exits a $n_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that if $n \geq n_0$ then $$\left| c_{n,k} - \zeta(3) \right| \leq \varepsilon \hspace{2mm} \forall k \leq n$$ Now, if we take $k=n$ , we have that $c_{n,n}$ converges to $\zeta(3)$ and in fact, we get the series discussed in section 3 but after that, it states that this series does not converge fast enough to proof the irrationality of $\zeta(3)$ . To explain that, he proofs a lema that states that $2[1,2, \cdots, n]^3 {n+k \choose k} c_{n,k}$ is an integer, where $[1,2, \cdots, n]=\mathrm{lcm}(1, 2, \cdots, n)$ . So, we can express for some sequence of integers $z_{n,k}$ $$c_{n,k}=\dfrac{z_{n,k}}{2[1,2, \cdots, n]^3 {n+k \choose k}}$$ It is then stated that given $\varepsilon>0$ for $n$ large enough $$[1,2, \cdots, n] \leq e^{n(1+\varepsilon)}$$ (which can be rigurously proven using the prime number theorem and the sketch given below the assertion) and from here, he states that this sequence has too large denominator to proof the irrationality. So, my first doubt: Doubt 1: How can we explain in detail, based on what is said before, that the series $c_{n,k}$ is not enough to proof the irrationality of $\zeta(3)$ ? ( Solved ) After that, it explain Apéry's process to accelerate the convergence of the series, which consists on applying several transformations to the sequence $c_{n,k}$ until we get two sequences (the second one in the paper has no name, so I name it after $e_{n,k}^{(i)}$ ): $$d_{n,k}^{(5)}=\sum_{h=0}^{k}\sum_{l=0}^h {k \choose h} {n \choose h} {h \choose l} {n \choose l} {2n-l \choose n} c_{n,n-l}$$ $$e_{n,k}^{(5)}=\sum_{h=0}^{k}\sum_{l=0}^h {k \choose h} {n \choose h} {h \choose l} {n \choose l} {2n-l \choose n}$$ Now, my doubts here are: Doubt 2: Why is it true that in this process, we still have that the quotient $d_{n,n}^{(i)}/e_{n,n}^{(i)}$ still converges to $\zeta(3)$ ? ( Solved ) I don't know how to get around when we divide by a sum. Doubt 3: How do we get that $2[1,2, \cdots, n]^3 d_{n,k}^{(i)}$ is still and integer? ( Solved ) Doubt 4: Why does this process, in an intuitive way, accelerate the convergence of the sequence? Section 5 In this section, it takes $a_n=d_{n,n}^{(5)}$ , $b_n=e_{n,n}^{(5)}$ , and considering it satisfies the recursion stated at the beggining of the paper, it is proven the irrationality of $\zeta(3)$ . After some manipulations, it is shown that $$\zeta(3) - \dfrac{a_n}{b_n}= \sum_{k=n+1}^\infty \dfrac{6}{k^3b_kb_{k-1}}$$ so (correct me if I'm wrong in the next reasoning) $$\zeta(3) - \dfrac{a_n}{b_n} \leq \dfrac{1}{b_n^2}\sum_{k=n+1}^\infty \dfrac{6}{k^3} \leq \dfrac{1}{b_n^2}\sum_{k=1}^\infty \dfrac{6}{k^3}$$ and we get that $b_n=O(b_n^{-2})$ . From here on, I don't really get much on the secction. Doubt 5: How can we proof, based on the equation stated for $b_n$ that $b_n=O(\alpha^n)$ ? Doubt 6: How can we proof, that $q_n=O(\alpha^n e^{3n})$ ? I thought these one was because $[1, 2, \cdots, n]=O(e^n)$ but as I was pointed on here thats not true so, I don't know how does he get that relation. Doubt 7: How do we get these two equalities $\zeta(3) - \frac{p_n}{q_n}=O(\alpha^{-2n})=O(q_n^{-(1+\delta)})$ with $\delta=(\log(\alpha)-3)/(\log(\alpha)+3)$ Sections 6 and 8 In section 6, after defining $a_n$ and $b_n$ it states that it is easy to prove that its quotient converges to $\zeta(3)$ , but as I asked in doubt 2, I don't know how to treat the quotient of two sums to get what we desired. I suppose the same answer for doubt 2 will be useful here so I want state it again but, at the beggining of section 8, it shows the relation between this $b_n$ and $e_{n,n}^{(5)}$ but, I don't know why is it true the next equalities: Doubt 8: $\sum_{k=0}^{n}\sum_{l=0}^k {n \choose k}^2 {n \choose l} {k \choose l} {2n-l \choose n}=\sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k}^2{2n-k \choose n}^2$ Doubt 9: $\sum_{k=0}^{n}\sum_{l=0}^k {n \choose k}^2 {n \choose l} {k \choose l} {2n-l \choose n} c_{n,n-k}=\sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k}^2{2n-k \choose n}^2 c_{n,n-k}$ Now, the following doubts are all combinatorial. Maybe I'm lacking of some binomial coefficients propierties, but after pages full of expansion, I didn't get the following equalities. Given $B_{n,k}=4(2n+1)(k(2k+1)-(2n+1)^2){n \choose k}^2{n+k \choose k}^2$ Doubt 10: $B_{n,k}-B_{n,k-1}=(n+1)^3{n+1 \choose k}^2{n+1+k \choose k}^2-(34n^3+51n^2+27n+5){n \choose k}^2{n+k \choose k}^2+n^3{n-1 \choose k}^2{n-1+k \choose k}^2$ Now, I know how to derive that $$c_{n,k}-c_{n-1,k}=\dfrac{1}{n^3}+\sum_{m=1}^k \dfrac{(-1)^m (m-1)!^2(n-m-1)!}{(n+m)!} \hspace{2mm}(*)$$ but I don't get the other subsequent equalities although the paper says it is clear. Doubt 11: $$(*)=\dfrac{1}{n^3}+\sum_{m=1}^k\left( \dfrac{(-1)^m m!^2(n-m-k)!}{n^2(n+m)!}-\dfrac{(-1)^{m-1} (m-1)!}{n^2(n+m+1)!}\right)=\dfrac{(-1)^k k!^2(n-k-1)!}{n^2(n+k)!}$$ After all that definitions, it know defines $$A_{n,k}=B_{n,k}c_{n,k}+\dfrac{5(2n+1)(-1)^{k-1}k}{n(n+1)}{n \choose k}{n+k \choose k}$$ and states that (9) is equal to $A_{n,k}-A_{n,k-1}$ . Doubt 12: How is (9) equal to $A_{n,k}-A_{n,k-1}$ ? And, to my disgrace, even assuming the last equality and after three pages full of equlities, I've been unable to prove that $a_n$ satisfies the desired recursion. Doubt 13: How can we show, using all the previous definitions that $a_n$ satisfies the recurrence relation stated at the beggining of the paper? I know there are a lot of doubts, but I've been working on this for 3 weeks now and I'm not able to solve any of the questions asked by myself. I think the post can be very useful to anyone interested in this proof because I think all the details I'm trying to proof are not easy for any student who reads the paper, so it would be great if anyone interested can contribute and we can answer all of them and have a really complete post about Apery's proof.

Also, the strategy is symmetric and the dwarves don't have a sense of time. The link above does not give a solution for these hypothesis. In more detail, the problem goes as follows: $100$ immortal dwarves are captured by an immortal ogre in order for him to play a game. The dwarves are in separate cells and never communicate, and each day the ogre chooses arbitrarily one dwarf and brings him to a room with a lightbulb which is either on or off. The dwarf can leave it as it is or switch it.  On the first day, the dwarve decide on a strategy, and the lightbulb is off.

I am putting this question here since I think some (very simple) combinatorics may be needed to find a proof for a symmetric strategy. Here is my answer for A: one of the dwarf is chosen as a 'leader': only him can switch on the light, and only him can speak to the ogre. So each time he switches it on (or not if it is already) and count the number of times he switched it on. All $99$ other dwarves can only switch the light off once if they find it on (and then do nothing more). Once the leader has switched the light on $100$ times (it is off at the beginning), he tells the ogre that all dwarves have seen the lightbulb.

Then, the function would be   $$ F(x) = (1 + \frac {x}{1!} + \frac {x^2}{2!} + \frac {x^3}{3!} + \frac {x^4}{4!} + \frac {x^5}{5!}) (1 + \frac {x}{1!} + \frac {x^2}{2!})^2 (1 + \frac {x}{1!})^2 $$   $$ F(x) = \frac {x^{11}}{120} + \frac {3 x^{10}}{40} + \frac {2 x^9}{5} + \frac {19 x^8}{12}+ \frac{289 x^7}{60}+\frac{331 x^6}{30}+\frac{2221 x^5}{120}+\frac {545 x^4}{24} + \frac{121 x^3}{6}+\frac{25 x^2}{2}+5 x+1 $$ Therefore, the answer would be $5!(\frac {1271}{120})$ However, how would I be able to apply it to the following problem? How many 5-card hands (from an ordinary deck) have at least one card of each suit? 4 suits, repeated 13 times $ 52*51*50*49*48 = 311,875,200 $ total possibilities $$ G(x) = (\frac {x^{13}}{13!} + \frac{x^{12}}{12!}+ \frac{x^{11}}{11!} + \frac{x^{10}}{10!} + \frac{x^9}{9!} + \frac{x^8}{8!} + \frac{x^7}{7!} + \frac{x^6}{6!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x}{1!} + 1)^4 $$ Of course, this would just give me unique combinations, so it doesn't work. Is there an actual method to solve using exponential generating functions? Is it possible or even recommended?",,['combinatorics']

The Aztec Diamond Theorem states that such a shape of order $n$ can be tiled in $2^{\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}$ ways using $2 \times 1$ dominoes. The Arctic Circle Theorem states that as $n$ becomes large, a random domino tiling of this Aztec diamond tends to have the following properties: The tiles outside a certain circle will be arranged homogeneously in a “brick-wall” pattern (these are the homogeneously coloured areas in the example below). They are denoted as frozen. For each corner, these patterns are distinct in orientation and phase. This can be visualised as follows: Suppose the diamond’s squares are marked black and white in a chessboard pattern. Then assign a different colour (red, green, blue, yellow) to each domino tile, depending on whether the top, left, right, or bottom half rests on a black square. A homogeneous brick-wall tiling would then correspond to a homogeneous colours as all tiles within have the same orientation and phase. A typical tiling would then look like this: My question is about whether such a configuration can be described as chaotic.

Theorem(Dilworth,1950) Let $P$ be a finite poset.Then the maximum size of an antichain in $P$ is equal to the minimum size of a cover of $P$ by disjoint chains. Proof: Let $M$ and $m$ denote respectively the maximum size of an antichain in $P$ and minimum size of a cover of $P$ by disjoint chains. It is trivial that $m\geq M$ . Now we will show that $m\leq M$ .We proceed by induction on $|P|$ . For $|P|=1$ ,it is trivial as both the sizes are $1$ . Now assume that the result is true for $k<|P|$ . Now,we prove the result for $k=|P|$ . Let $C$ be a maximal chain in $P$ . Case-1: Every antichain in $P\setminus C$ contains at most $M-1$ elements. So, $P\setminus C$ is a union of $\leq M-1$ disjoint chains by induction hypothesis. $\implies$ $P$ is a union of $\leq M$ disjoint chains. So, $m\leq M$ .

Define $S^-=\{x\in P:x\leq a_i \text{ for some } i \}$ $S^+=\{x\in P:x\geq a_i \text{ for some } i \}$ Therefore $A\subset S^-$ Because of maximality,the largest element in $C$ is not in $S^-$ So, $|S^-|<|P|$ By induction hypothesis, $S^-$ is the union of $M$ disjoint chains $S_1^-,S_2^-,...,S_M^-$ where $a_i\in S_i^-$ $\color{red}{\text{(Why?)}}$ If $x\in S_i^-$ and $x>a_i$ then since $x\leq a_j$ for some $j$ we would get $a_i<a_j$ which is a contradiction. Therefore $a_i$ is the maximal element of $S_i^-$ for all $i=1(1)M$ Do,the same for $S^+=\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^M S_i^+$ where $S_i^+\cap S_j^+=\phi$ for all $i\neq j$ and $a_i\in S_i^+$ such that $a_i$ is the minimal element of $S_i^+$ $D_i=S_i^+\cup S_i^-$ is a chain for $i=1(1)M$ observing that $P=S^+\cup S^-$ is the union of disjoint chains $D_i$ where $i=1(1)M$ This is from a note given by our instructor.Can someone explain me the proof so that it becomes crystal clear?Concrete examples at critical points is also welcome. Addendum I have tried to provide as much I have understood below. Clearly, $m\geq M$ because if $\{a_1,a_2,...,a_M\}$ is a maximal antichain and $P=A_1\cup A_2\cup...\cup A_m$ is a cover of $P$ by disjoint chains,then no two $a_i$ 's are in the same $A_k$ so,at least $M$ disjoint chains are required. Now,we have to show, $m\leq M$ . Now to understand Case:1 let us consider the following example: Let, $X=\{1,2,3\}$ and $P=\mathcal P(X)$ .Notice that $M=3$ here. Now, $C=\{\phi,\{1\},\{1,2\},\{1,2,3\}\}$ Then, $P\setminus C=\{\{2\},\{3\},\{2,3\},\{3,1\}\}$ Antichains in $P\setminus C$ are $\{\{2\},\{3\}\}$ and $\{\{2,3\},\{3,1\}\},\{\{2\},\{3,1\}\}$ . So,we observe that all antichains in $P\setminus C$ contains $\leq 3-1=2$ elements and hence we are in Case:1 . Now,clearly we obtain that $P$ is a union of at most $3$ disjoint chains.So, $m\leq 3=M$ . Now let us come to Case:2 which says that there is an antichain in $P\setminus C$ of size $M$ . Assume that $A=\{a_1,...,a_M\}$ is an antichain in $P\setminus C$ . Let, $S^-=\{x\in P:x\leq a_i$ for some $i\}$ Then, $A\subset S^-$ .The explanation is given below: $x\in A\implies x=a_i\leq a_i$ for some $i\implies x \in S^-$ Now, $C$ is a finite chain and hence it has a largest element say $a$ . Due to maximality of size of $C=\{...,a\}$ , $a\notin S^-$ . If $a\in S^-\implies a\leq a_i$ for some $i\implies C\cup \{a_i\}$ is larger chain in size that $C$ . So, $|S^-|<|P|$ . So,we can use the induction hypothesis. $S^-=S_1^-\cup...\cup S_M^-$ disjoint chains $\color{red}{\text{(Why $M$ chains?It could have been any number $k\geq M$,so why $k>M$ is not possible?)}}$ Where $a_i\in S_i$ . Because for $i\neq j$ , $a_i,a_j$ both cannot be in $S_i$ together or in $S_j$ together. Now, $a_i$ is (the) maximal element of $S_i^-$ . Because if $x\in S_i^-$ and $x>a_i$ Then since $x\in S_i^-\subset S^-\implies x\leq a_j$ and so, $a_i<a_j$ which is a contradiction. Doing the same for $S^+$ we can show that $a_i$ is the minimal element of $S_i^+$ . So, $D_i=S_i^-\cup S_i^+=\{....\leq a_i\leq...\}$ is a chain. For $i\neq j$ , $D_i\cap D_j=\phi$ . $\color{red}{\text{(Why?)}}$ So, $P=S^+\cup S^-=D_1\cup...\cup D_M$ which is a union of $M$ disjoint chains.

98,Set with a property,Set with a property,,"This was a mock math olympiad problem sent to me by a friend. Let $P$ be a set of prime numbers. Then, create a set $S$ of positive integers that satisfies the following property: For every element $p \in P$ , $p$ is a factor of at least three elements in $S$ . Prove that for all sets $P$ and $S$ , it is possible to divide $S$ into 4 nonempty subsets such that each $p$ is a factor of at least three integers. I tried to consider the element $a \in P$ that was a factor of the least number of elements in $S$ and see what I could discover, but got nowhere. I also thought that perhaps some sort of algorithm would work too, but I didn't make any progress. Overall, I'm just not quite sure how to even start.","This was a mock math olympiad problem sent to me by a friend. Let be a set of prime numbers.

99,"Nonattacking ""queens"" on tiled triangles","Nonattacking ""queens"" on tiled triangles",,"I'll start with what my question is not. My question is not Nonattacking rooks on a triangular chessboard or The number of spacing $k$ non-attacking towers on the board $\left\{(i,j):1 \le i \le j \le n \right\}$ . Those questions are about taking a square grid and making a ""triangular chessboard"" by removing the squares of a chessboard above the diagonal. My question is about tiled triangles of the following form (not truncated square grids): I will define a ""queen"" on this tiled triangle to attack in the three directions parallel to the triangle on which the queen is located. Below, I have placed a queen on the darkest blue triangle and the light blue triangles are where the queen attacks. I am interested in the maximal number of non-attacking queens I can place on this tiled triangle. For example, I can imagine placing down queens until every triangle is under attack: Or, as another example, My questions are: For a tiled equilateral triangle of side length $n$ , what is the maximal number of non-attacking queens I can add to the triangle? How many configurations have the maximal number of non-attacking queens? By side length, I mean for example that the above tiled triangles have a side-length of five. I think my trouble has been that I'm unsure of a good coordinate system for the tiled triangle. It's two dimensional, but I take out three straight lines corresponding to the horizontal, diagonal, and antidiagonal directions when I add a queen. Further, knowing which horizontal row and diagonal I am in does not typically fix the antidiagonal I am in (there are typically two choice for the antidiagonal). From inspection, it looks like the maximum number of non-attacking queens on a tiled triangle of sidelength $n$ is $\lceil n/2 \rceil$ . Maybe induction on the length of the sides could work? It looks like adding row of triangles at the base of a maximal-number-of-queens odd $n$ triangle gives a maximal number-of-queens even $n+1$ triangle, but I am unsure of how to show this.","I'll start with what my question is not.
