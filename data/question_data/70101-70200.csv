I proved a theorem which assumes a space to be connected locally connected hereditarily Baire and metrizable.

I took some pains to demonstrate that any Bernstein subset of the plane is a connected locally connected hereditarily Baire space that is not completely metrizable just to show that my theorem is not about nothing. However, separability of the space will also make my theorem useless, so I have not managed to demonstrate that my theorem increases the class of spaces for which the claim holds.

By the definition of product topology, for each $U_i = \prod_{j \in J} U_{i,j}$, there are at most finitely many $U_{i,j} \not= \Bbb{R}$. Let $k_i = \{ j \in J | U_{i,j} \not= \Bbb{R} \}$. So $k_i$ is a finite set. Now let $K = k_1 \cup k_2 \cup ...$. Since $K$ is the countable union of countable sets, it must be countable. Define $f: K \rightarrow J$ to be the inclusion. Since $K$ is countable and $J$ is not, $f$ cannot be surjectie. i.e. there exists $l \in J$ such that $f^{-1}(l)$ is the empty set.

7,Mysior plane is not realcompact,Mysior plane is not realcompact,,"Let $X = \mathbb{R}^2$ with $(x, y)\in X$ for $y\neq 0$ isolated and $(x, 0)$ having neighbourhood basis of the form $$U_n(x) = \{(x, y) : y\in (-1/n, 1/n)\}\cup \{(x+y+1, y) : 0 < y < 1/n\}\cup \{(x+\sqrt{2}+y, -y) : 0 < y < 1/n\}.$$ The space $X$ is called Mysior plane, and it's an example of a space which is a union of two closed subspaces, $X_+ = \mathbb{R}\times [0, \infty)$ and $X_- = \mathbb{R}\times (-\infty, 0]$ , which are realcompact, but isn't itself realcompact. Since the map $f:X_+\sqcup X_-\to X$ is perfect, this shows realcompactness is not invariant under perfect mappings. The space $X$ is Tychonoff: Say $(x, y), (w, t)\in X$ . If $y\neq 0$ or $t\neq 0$ this is quite obvious since one of the points is isolated. If $y = t = 0$ , and $x < w$ , then by splitting into three cases $x < w \leq x+1, x+1 < w \leq x+\sqrt{2}$ and $w\geq x+\sqrt{2}$ one can easily see that we have disjoint neighbourhoods. Thus $X$ is Hausdorff. If $(x, y)\notin F$ and $F$ is closed, of course the only interesting case is when $y = 0$ for otherwise $\{(x, y)\}$ is clopen. In that case we can find $n$ with $U_n(x)\subseteq F^c$ . By defining $f(w, t) = 1$ for $(w, t)\notin U_n(x)$ and $f(w, t) = nt$ for $(w, t)\in U_n(x)$ , we see that $f$ is continuous and so $X$ is Tychonoff. To see that $X_+$ and $X_-$ are realcompact, lets focus on $X_+$ . If $\mathcal{F}$ is a real z-ultrafilter on $X_+$ , then since $\mathbb{R}\times [0, a]$ for $a > 0$ is clopen, we can see that if $\mathbb{R}\times (a, \infty)\in\mathcal{F}$ , then $\mathcal{F}\restriction_{\mathbb{R}\times (a, \infty)}$ is a real z-ultrafilter on the realcompact space $\mathbb{R}\times (a, \infty)$ , and as such is fixed, so that $\mathcal{F}$ is fixed. Otherwise, if for all $a > 0$ , $\mathbb{R}\times [0, a]\in \mathcal{F}$ , then $\mathbb{R}\times \{0\}\in\mathcal{F}$ since $\mathcal{F}$ is closed under countable intersections. One can observe that $([a, b]+\mathbb{Z})\times \{0\}$ for $a < b$ are zero sets of $X_+$ by construction appropriate functions (similar to the one in the proof that $X$ is Tychonoff). Thus $([0, 1/2]+\mathbb{Z})\times \{0\}\in \mathcal{F}$ or $([1/2, 1]+\mathbb{Z})\times\{0\}\in \mathcal{F}$ , for example the former case holds. Take $a = \sup \{x\in [0, 1/2] : ([x, 1/2]+\mathbb{Z})\times\{0\}\in \mathcal{F}\}$ and $b = \inf\{x\in [a, 1/2] : ([a, x]+\mathbb{Z})\times\{0\}\in\mathcal{F}\}$ . Once again one would show that $[a, b]+\mathbb{Z}\in \mathcal{F}$ from closure under countable intersections, and if $a\neq b$ we could take $a < c < b$ and by considering $([a, c]+\mathbb{Z})\times\{0\}$ and $([c, b]+\mathbb{Z})\times\{0\}$ obtain a contradiction with choice of $a, b$ . Thus $(a+\mathbb{Z})\times\{0\}\in\mathcal{F}$ for some $a\in \mathbb{R}$ . However, since $(a+\mathbb{Z})\times\{0\} = \bigcup_{n\in \mathbb{Z}}\{(a+n, 0)\}$ is a countable union of zero sets, and since $\mathcal{F}$ is a real z-ultrafilter, we must have $\{(a+n, 0)\}\in\mathcal{F}$ for some $n$ , that is $\mathcal{F}$ is a fixed z-ultrafilter. This proves $X_+$ is realcompact, the proof for $X_-$ is the same. Could anyone help me on how to show that $X$ is not realcompact? Edit: A z-ultrafilter is an ultrafilter on the lattice of zero sets (as to distinguish them from ultrafilters on the lattice of sets), and a real z-ultrafilter is a z-ultrafilter closed under countable intersections.

Treves starts from a TVS $(E,\iota)$ , which determines the set of continuous linear forms on $E$ : $E'_\iota$ .

He then describes an analogous way to topologise the set of continuous linear maps $\phi:(E,\tau)\rightarrow (F,\sigma)$ where $(E,\tau)$ and $(F,\sigma)$ are two TVS, let us call this set $L(E,F)$ . This is evidently a generalization of the previous case, if one considers $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$ with the usual topology. Characherizes which topologies $\tau$ on $E$ are such that $E'_\iota=E'_\tau$ . Hence, which way of retopologizing a TVS $E$ preserve its topological dual. He calls these topologies compatible with a duality and proves that any topology on a locally convex TVS $E$ can be seen as such: it is the topology of uniform conergence on equicontinuous subsets of $E'$ . Moreover he shows that $\sigma(E,E')$ , the topology of convergence on finite sets of $E'$ is the coarsest to achieve the result and moreover he shows we can always embed $E$ in $(E'_\sigma)'$ . Proves the Mackey theorem stating that topologies compatible with a duality share the same bounded sets, and treat reflexivity.

9,Infinite graph is planar iff it can be embedded in sphere,Infinite graph is planar iff it can be embedded in sphere,,"My question is about the following statement about planar graphs: A graph is planar (i.e. can be embedded in the plane) if and only if it can be embedded in the sphere $S^2$. By an embedding we mean the following: To every vertex $v \in V$ we associate a unique point in $\mathbb{R}^2$(or $S^2$). To every edge $e \in G$ we associate a unique simple arc, which is a homeomorphic image of $[0,1]$, connecting the points associated to its end vertices such that no two arcs intersect other than in a common vertex point. The ""only if"" part of the statement above follows directly by using stereographic projection, which gives an embedding $\mathbb{R}^2 \hookrightarrow S^2$.  For the ""if"" part, in every proof I find one simply says that in an embedding of a graph in $S^2$, one can always avoid a point and can therefore use stereographic projection again to get the embedding in $\mathbb{R}^2$. I can see this fact being true for finite graphs, as the embedded graph is just the bijective continuous image of finitely many intervals glued together in some way (which is a compact space), so if the image was the whole $S^2$, we would get a homeomorphism between $S^2$ and something which isn't $S^2$. But what about infinite graphs? As far as I know, a graph is just defined to be a tuple $(V,E)$, where $V$ is a set (of vertices) and $E$ is a set consisting of some 2-element-subsets of $V$. So $V$ can be basically anything, so I could for example just take $V = S^2$ (as a set), or any other (uncountable) infinite set.

10,Variants of Kuratowski's 14 set theorem,Variants of Kuratowski's 14 set theorem,,"Kuratowski's 14 set theorem says that there are at most 14 sets one can obtain from a given set $A\subseteq X$ in a topological space $X$ by repeatedly applying the interior and complement operations. He also showed that if you add intersection to that list (and thus all the Boolean operations) there are potentially infinitely many sets one can obtain. My question is the following: For each $n$, what is the maximum number of sets one can obtain from a given set by using complement, intersection, and at most $n$ applications of the interior operation? It is certainly finite. For example, the number of sets one can make from the Boolean operations and one application of the interior operation is not more than the Boolean algebra freely generated by $A$ and its formal interior $int(A)$ -- i.e. 16. And, more generally, the number of sets one can make from n+1 applications of the interior operation will not exceed the size of the Boolean algebra freely generated by the elements generated by $n$ applications, and the formal interiors of those elements. As a means of answering this, it's natural to look for an analogue of disjunctive normal form in propositional logic. Each combination of Boolean operations that potentially produces different results when applied to $k$ distinct sets $A_1...A_k$ is equivalent to a combination that has the form of a union of intersections, where each intersection consists of either $A_i$ or its complement for each $i \in 1...k$. So my second question is: Is there a (pretty) canonical way of expressing the combinations of operations from $\{int, \cdot^c, \cap, \cup\}$, in $k$ variables, that potentially produce different sets? More precisely, we may define the formal expressions over variables $A_1...A_k$ as follows: $A_1...A_k$ are expressions, and $int(B)$, $B^c$, $B\cap C$ and $B\cup C$ are expressions if $B$ and $C$ are (and, moreover, the expressions are the smallest set of strings closed under these rules). Say that two expressions are equivalent if they evaluate to the same thing in every topological space, for every assignment of sets to the variables. A satisfactory answer to 2 must then deliver a collection of canonical expressions such that no two canonical expressions are equivalent, and such that every expression is equivalent to a canonical expression. Of course, to answer question 1 we only need the case where k=1. (Any pointers to relevant literature also appreciated.) EDIT: Incidentally, I'm particularly interested in the case where $X$ is extremally disconnected, so if imposing that condition makes the question simpler I'd also be very interested.","Kuratowski's 14 set theorem says that there are at most 14 sets one can obtain from a given set $A\subseteq X$ in a topological space $X$ by repeatedly applying the interior and complement operations.

18,Understanding Brouwer Separation Theorem with an easier proof,Understanding Brouwer Separation Theorem with an easier proof,,"I'd like to undersand better Brouwer separation theorem given in Massey (Proposition 6.5 p.215) since has some smoky parts to me. To lighten the notation we set $D^n := \mathbb{D}^n, S^n := \mathbb{S}^n$ Lemma $6.2$ would be cited so I'm going to cite the statement: Lemma: Let $Y$ be a subset of $S^n$ which is homeomorphic to $I^k$ where $0 \leq k \leq n$ . Then $\tilde{H}_i(S^n-Y) = 0$ for all $i$ . Furthermore let's denote $C_0,C_1$ the two connected components of the follwing: Proposition: Let $A \subset S^{n}$ homeomorphic to $S^{n-1}$ , then $A$ is the boundary of each components of $S^n-A$ . Proof: In order to prove the Proposition we must show that : The boundary of each component is a subset of $A$ . Any point $a \in A$ is a boundary point of each component of $S^n-A$ . To prove the first, Massey asserts that it's sufficient to know that $S^n-A$ is open (but I don't understand why, any help would be appreciated). I'd like to give my explanation and ask if it's correct: Let's suppose for the sake of contradiction that $\exists p \in \overline{C_0}^{S^n} \cap C_1$ . Since $p$ belongs to the first set, for every neighborhood $U$ of $p$ exists a sequence $(x_n)_n \in C_0$ such that $x_n \to p$ and $x_n \in U$ definitely. Since $C_1$ is open in $S^n$ , exists $V$ neighborhood, with $p \in V \subset C_1$ . This leads to contradiction since we then would have $C_0 \cap C_1 \ne \varnothing$ . Is this reasoning correct? The proof prooceds as follows to prove the second point: Let N be any open neighborhood of $a$ in $S^n$ ; we must show that $N \cap C_i \ne \varnothing$ for $i=0,1$ . Note that $N \cap A$ is an open neighborhood of $a \in A$ . Since $A$ is homeomorphic to $S^{n-1}$ , we can find a decomposition $$A = A_1 \cup A_2$$ where $A_i$ is homeomorphic to $D^{n-1}$ and $A_1 \cap A_2 \simeq S^{n-2}$ , with $A_2 \subset N \cap A$ . We know from Lemma $6.2$ that $S^n - A_1$ is arcwise connected. Let $p_0 \in C_0,p_1 \in C_1$ and choose an arc $ f: I \longmapsto S^n - A_1$ that joins them. Since $f(I) \cap A \ne \varnothing$ we must have $f(I) \cap A_2 \ne \varnothing.$ Consider the subset $f^{-1}(A_2) \subset I$ ; this is a compact subset of $I$ and hence it munst have a least a point $t_0$ and a greatest point $t_1$ . Obviously $t_0,t_1$ are boundary points of $f^{-1}(A_2)$ , and $f^{-1}(N)$ is an open subset of $I$ which cointains both. From this follows by an easy arguments that $f^{-1}(N) \cap f^{-1}(C_i) \ne \varnothing$ for $i=0,1$ which completes the proof. Question : Here I don't understand what's the easy argument and why we have the necessity to use $t_0,t_1$ which arises from compactness of $f^{-1}(A_2)$ . My argument was the following: Since $I = f^{-1}(N) \cup f^{-1}(C_0) \cup f^{-1}(C_1)$ those are three open subset of $I$ which is connected, so we must have intersection, but $f^{-1}(N)$ necessarly $f^{-1}(N)$ has to lie in the middle of $I$ since $f^{-1}(C_1)$ and $f^{-1}(C_0)$ can't intersect; so we have $f^{-1}(N) \cap f^{-1}(C_i) \ne \varnothing$ for $i=0,1$ as requested. Where this fails? This argument doesn't use that $f^{-1}(A_2)$ is compact since it only uses that $A_2 \subset N$ , hence $f^{-1}(A_2) \subset f^{-1}(N)$ .

22,A definition of differentiable functions for arbitrary topological spaces,A definition of differentiable functions for arbitrary topological spaces,,"Background It is well-known that there is no notion of derivative for arbitrary topological spaces. However while investigating the notion of derivative as we find in one variable real analysis I came to generalize the notion. I am now wondering what properties must this notion of ""differentiable function"" satisfy in order to become a ""good"" enough definition. Our motivation for the formulation of this definition is mainly Caratheodory's definition of derivative . The Definition Before going straight into the definition itself, let me mention at the outset that this question is a revised version of this deleted MO question. Let us first consider a certain special case of the definition in the following, Definition 1. Let $R$ be a field and $\tau_1,\tau_2$ be any two topologies on $R$ . A continuous function $f:R\to R$ will be said to be $(\tau_1,\tau_2)$ -differentiable on $R$ at $a\in R$ iff there exists a function $g:(R,\tau_1)\to (R,\tau_2)$ such that, $$g(x):=\begin{cases}\dfrac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}&\text{if}~x\ne a\\L&\text{else} \end{cases}$$ for all $x\in R$ and $g$ is continuous at $a$ . We can generalize the above definition as follows, Definition 2. Let $X,Y$ be arbitrary topological spaces. Let $g_a:X\to Y\times Y\times X\times X$ be the function defined by, $$g_a(x):=(f(x),f(a),x,a)$$ for all $x\in X$ .

However while investigating the notion of derivative as we find in one variable real analysis I came to generalize the notion. I am now wondering what properties must this notion of ""differentiable function"" satisfy in order to become a ""good"" enough definition. Our motivation for the formulation of this definition is mainly Caratheodory's definition of derivative . The Definition Before going straight into the definition itself, let me mention at the outset that this question is a revised version of this deleted MO question. Let us first consider a certain special case of the definition in the following, Definition 1. Let be a field and be any two topologies on . A continuous function will be said to be -differentiable on at iff there exists a function such that, for all and is continuous at . We can generalize the above definition as follows, Definition 2. Let be arbitrary topological spaces. Let be the function defined by, for all .

Since a manifold is locally Euclidean, I can walk a infinitely small way in an ""Euclidean"" manner.

Let $X$ be a surface and let $\mbox{Mob}$ be a Möbius strip, which is the quotient space $$\mbox{Mob} := (\mathbb{R}/2\mathbb{Z}  \times [-1, 1] )/\langle \tau \rangle.$$ where $\tau :\mathbb{R}/2\mathbb{Z}  \times [-1, 1] \to \mathbb{R}/2\mathbb{Z}  \times [-1, 1]$ is given by $t(s,t)=(s+1,-t)$. The core curve of $\mbox{Mob}$ is the simple close curve given by $\{(x,0)| x \in \mathbb{R}/2\mathbb{Z}\} $. We can also assume the existence of a PL neighborhood for our curve. Definition: A curve $\gamma$ is one-sided if there exist an embedding $\varphi : \mbox{Mob} \to X$ such that the $\gamma$ is the core curve of $\varphi (\mbox{Mob})$. Using these definitions, I would like to prove the following proposition: Proposition: A surface $X$ is orientable if and only if it does not contain any one-sided curve. Here's a proof that if $X$ is orientable, then it does not contain any one-sided curve. However, I did not find a satisfactory proof of the converse. I would ideally like to have a net proof of this result using these definitions and most importantly without using the classification of surfaces (in particular the concept of genus). $(\Rightarrow)$ Suppose $e: \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z} \to X$ is an embedding, and let  $f: \mbox{Mob} \to X$ be such that $f \circ c= e$.

In particular, $H_i(M) \cong H_i(\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})$. From the inclusions $M \cap V \to X$, $\iota_M: M \cap V \to M$, and $\iota_V: M \cap V \to V$, we obtain the Mayer-Vietoris long exact sequence $$ \cdots \to H_2(M) \oplus H_2(V) \to H_2(X)~ \stackrel{\delta}{\to} H_1(M \cap V) \stackrel{\iota_M \oplus \iota_V}{\longrightarrow} H_1(M) \oplus H_1(V) \to \cdots.$$ The space $V$ is an open 2-dimensional manifold and hence $H_2(V) = \{0\}$.  In addition, $H_2(M) \cong H_2(\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})=\{0\}$, and so the map $\delta$ is an injection. On the other hand, $H_1(M \cap V)$ is generated by the 1-cycle $\partial M$.
