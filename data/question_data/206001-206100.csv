Letting $D$ and $P$ denote these sets, respectively, it is obvious that $|D|=2^{56}$ and $|P|=26!$ .

I know that any binary string can be represented uniquely in the form $0^{\alpha_1}10^{\alpha_2}1\cdots 10^{\alpha_k}$ where $0^j$ denotes a string of $j$ consecutive zeroes. However, this doesn't immediately help to get a permutation of $26$ letters, since the $\alpha_i$ could be between $0$ and $56$ , and they could repeat.

Find a compact formula for $a_n$ . The conclusion is that each letter must appear in a ""group"" of the same letters of size 2 or more. My first approach was by recursion and I got: $$a_n = 7a_{n-2} + 7a_{n-3},  a_0 = 1, a_1 = 0, a_2 = 7$$ since every string of length $n$ can be created from a string of length $n-2$ by adding two identical letters, or from a string of length $n-3$ by adding three identical letters. We can achieve a group of any length in this way. Each time, we choose the color of the added letters in 7 ways. The second way is to use stars and bars, dividing into elements $\geq 2$ . At the start, we can assign 2 elements to each of the $k$ groups, so we have the standard stars and bars but for $n-2k$ elements: $$\binom{n-2k+k-1}{k-1} = \binom{n-k-1}{k-1}.$$ Then we sum over all possible numbers of groups and assign a color to each group in 7 ways: $$a_n = \sum_{k=1}^{\left\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor}\binom{n-k-1}{k-1} \cdot 7^k.$$ There are at most $\left\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor$ groups. However, first of all, these two solutions give different values, and secondly, I suspect that they count some things more than once, because numbers they give are slightly larger than when manually counting the possibilities.

Right now I am reading Book of Proof, by Richard Hammack, and in the Chapter on Counting, I came across the following exercise: Use combinatorial proof to show that $\sum\limits_{k=0}^{n}\binom{n}{k}\binom{k}{m}=\binom{n}{m}2^{n-m}$ . My proof was the following: Notice that the right-hand side of the equation is the number of ways we can make a string of length $n$ from the symbols $\{A,B,C\}$ with repetition allowed. First we choose the position of the $A$ 's. We can do that in $\binom{n}{m}$ ways, such that $m\leq n$ is the number of $A$ 's in our string. For the remaining $(n-m)$ positions, we have two options: they are either $B$ or $C$ , therefore there are $2^{n-m}$ ways of filling them up. Thus, as we claimed, $\binom{n}{m}2^{n-m}$ . Now we will count the number of ways we can make a string of length $n$ from the symbols $\{A,B,C\}$ with repetition allowed in a different way: first, we select the number of positions that are not $C$ , and fill the rest with $C$ 's. We can do this in $\binom{n}{k}$ ways, where $k$ is the number of positions that are not $C$ . From those $k$ positions, we choose the ones that are $A$ 's and fill them up, which we can do in $\binom{k}{m}$ ways, where $m$ is the number of $A$ 's in our string. Finally, fill every blank space with $B$ 's. Thus, the number of string with $(n-k)$ $C$ 's and $m$ $A$ 's is $\binom{n}{k}\binom{k}{m}$ . Since $k$ can be any number in $[0,n]$ , to count all the possible strings we have $\sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{n}{k}\binom{k}{m}$ . Since the right-hand and the left-hand sides are solutions to the same counting problem, we conclude they are equal. $\blacksquare$ I desperately need some feedback on my proof-writing skills. It feels like my argument is solid, but at the same time, my writing might be somewhat convoluted. I don't know if it is clear enough, not straightforward enough, or if I explained too much.
