In an alphabet of $n$ distinct letters, how many words of length $3n$ , where each letter appears $3$ times, can be formed such that no $3$ consecutive letters are the same? Attempt. Suppose first that the identical letters are distinguishable. Choose $k$ letters to form consecutive triples in our word, where $k=0,1,...,n$ . There are ${n \choose k}$ choices for these letters. Then, we may order the remaining letters arbitrarily, of which there are $(3n-k)!$ ways to do so, since these are just permutations. Implicitly, we are regarding each triple as one letter. Next, since we assumed the identical letters are distinguishable, each triple has $3!=6$ different orderings, giving a total of $6^k$ different orderings for our $k$ triples, by the product rule.

15,Consider strings of length 9 that satisfy the following conditions :,Consider strings of length 9 that satisfy the following conditions :,,"Consider strings of length 9 that satisfy the following conditions: (i) The string contains four digits chosen from the set ${2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}$ . (ii) The string contains all five letters $A$ , $B$ , $C$ , $D$ , $E$ , such that the first occurrence of letters (i.e. the leftmost letter) must be $A$ , and the last occurrence of letters (i.e. the rightmost letter) must be $E$ . For example, $BCDAE2345$ doesn't satisfy the conditions since $A$ isn't the leftmost letter. Solution: Choose 4 digits: $\binom{6}{4}$ Choose location for 5 letters: $\binom{9}{5}$ Choose relative arrangement of $B,C,D$ : $P(3,3)$ Choose relative arrangement of digits: $P(4,4)$ Thus, the answer would be: $\binom{6}{4} \binom{9}{5} \cdot P(3,3) \cdot P(4,4) = 272160$ What I don't understand: To find the number of ways to put 4 digits in the string, why didn't we first find all the ways to pick 4 elements of the set which is $\binom{6}{4}$ , then count the ways to put these 4 digits in the 9 letter string, so $\binom{9}{5}$ . Then we count all the locations to put 5 letters in the string. so $C(9,5)$ . Then we permute around the 4 numbers to find all arrangements. so $P(4,4)$ .

If you walked 345 meters by 6 PM, the total number of meters you will have walked today can not be less than 345 meters. This is because you can not ""un-walk"" the meters you have already walked. Do these concepts have proper names in math? E.g Commutative, reflexive, symmetric, etc?  How would you describe this property using mathematical terms - a set of objects that have certain properties, such that once a certain type of opperation is performed on objects in the set, the ""cardinality"" of set achieves a new infimum and supremum? Do such terms in mathematics exist that can correspond to the examples I laid out? Thanks!",,"['discrete-mathematics', 'supremum-and-infimum']"

I am not sure the final lines are correct as I know that showing 2,4 are factors of $4k^2 + 4k$ is enough to prove that it is divisible by 8 and I have looked at some other examples. In an example of 30, both 3 and 6 are factors of 30 but 30 is not divisible by 18. But I am stuck on how to modify this proof to be complete. To prove this statement, I intend to use direct proof. Since n has to be an odd integer as prescribed in the statement, by the definition of odd numbers, $(2k+1)^2-1$ must be divisible by 8 where $n = 2k+1$ for some integer k. Next, we expand $(2k+1)^2-1$ to be $4k^2 + 4k + 1 - 1$ , which simplifies to $4k^2 + 4k$ . First, we use the distributive property to get the following $4(k^2 + k)$ . We let $m = k^2 + k$ and therefore $4(k^2 + k)$ = $4m$ . Hence, we know that $4k^2 + 4k$ must be divisible by 4. Then, we use the distributive property to factor 4k from the expression to get $4k(k + 1)$ . By the definition of even and odd number, if k is odd then k+1 must be even and if k is even then k+1 is odd.

99,A connected graph has an Euler circuit if and only if every vertex has even degree.,A connected graph has an Euler circuit if and only if every vertex has even degree.,,"I wrote this proof for simple graphs. Any feedback is appreciated. Theorem : A connected graph has an Euler circuit $\iff$ every vertex has even degree. Proof : $P \implies Q$, we want to show that if a connected graph $G$ has an Euler circuit, then all $v \in V(G)$ have even degree. An Euler circuit is a closed walk such that every edge in a connected graph $G$ is traversed exactly once. We define $w = v_0, v_1, v_2, ... v_k$, such that $v_0 = v_k$, to be that Euler circuit in $G$ of length $k$. We assume $|V(G)| > 0$. Case 1, $0 < i < k$: Since all edges in $w$ will be traversed, but no edge can be traversed more than once, we reach $v_i$ via one edge $\{v_{i-1}, v_i\}$ and have to leave via another untraversed edge $\{v_i, v_{i+1}\}$, so $deg(v_i) = 2n$, where $n$ is equal to the number of times $v_i$ appears in $w$, for $0 < i < k$. Case 2, $i \in {0, k}$: At the beginning of $w$, we traverse any edge incident to $v_0$, that is $\{v_0, v_1\}$. By definition of an Eulerian circuit, we also have to conclude the walk at the same vertex where we started, hence we reach $v_0 = v_k$ again via a different, $k$-th edge $\{v_{k-1}, v_k\}$. Every $n$ times we pass $v_0 = v_k$ before concluding the walk, Case 1 applies, hence $deg(v_0) = deg(v_k) = 2 + 2n$, which is even. $Q \implies P$, we want to show the other direction, that is if all $v \in V(G)$ have even degree, then a connected graph $G$ has an Euler circuit. Proposition $P(n)$: If $G$ is a connected graph with $n$ edges and all $v \in V(G)$ have even degree, then $G$ has an Euler circuit. We proceed by induction on $n$. Base case $P(0)$:  A connected graph without any edges has only one vertex $v$ with $deg(v) = 0$, therefore $P(0)$ is true. For purpose of induction, we assume $P(n)$ is true. Inductive step , $P(n + 1)$: Assume $G$ has $n+1$ edges. Since all $v \in V(G)$ have even degree, we know $G$ can't be a tree, so we can find a cycle $c = u_0, u_1, ..., u_i, ..., u_k$ of length $k$ in $G$. If $k = |E(G)|$, we found an Eulerian circuit that visits all edges exactly once and are done. Otherwise, remove all edges in $c$ from $G$. The resulting subgraph $G'$ might contain $s$ connected components $G'_j$ for $0 \leq j < s$. We know that all vertices in $c$ have even degree, so any vertex in $G'_{j}$ that was adjacent to a vertex in $c$ will have an even number of edges removed, therefore the parity of all $v \in G'$ remains even. the  Also, all $G'_j$ will have at most $n$ edges. Therefore we can assume $P(n)$ for all $G'_j$, that means we can find a Eulerian walk $w_j$ in each $G'_j$. Now reinsert the edges from $c$ into $G'$, reconstructing $G$. We walk all vertices in $c$, starting at any vertex $u \in c$. When we reach a vertex $u_i$ in $c$ for the first time and $u_i$ was part of a $G'_j$, we branch into $w_j$, follow that Eulerian walk $w_j$ until its end and continue to $u_{i+1}$. We do this for all $G'_j$ until we reach $u_k$. This will form an Eulerian walk that visits all edges in $G$ exactly once. I found the last part, where the cycle is re-inserted into the graph again quite hairy to describe properly, but leaving out superfluous details.","I wrote this proof for simple graphs.

Inductive step , $P(n + 1)$: Assume $G$ has $n+1$ edges. Since all $v \in V(G)$ have even degree, we know $G$ can't be a tree, so we can find a cycle $c = u_0, u_1, ..., u_i, ..., u_k$ of length $k$ in $G$. If $k = |E(G)|$, we found an Eulerian circuit that visits all edges exactly once and are done. Otherwise, remove all edges in $c$ from $G$. The resulting subgraph $G'$ might contain $s$ connected components $G'_j$ for $0 \leq j < s$. We know that all vertices in $c$ have even degree, so any vertex in $G'_{j}$ that was adjacent to a vertex in $c$ will have an even number of edges removed, therefore the parity of all $v \in G'$ remains even. the  Also, all $G'_j$ will have at most $n$ edges. Therefore we can assume $P(n)$ for all $G'_j$, that means we can find a Eulerian walk $w_j$ in each $G'_j$. Now reinsert the edges from $c$ into $G'$, reconstructing $G$. We walk all vertices in $c$, starting at any vertex $u \in c$. When we reach a vertex $u_i$ in $c$ for the first time and $u_i$ was part of a $G'_j$, we branch into $w_j$, follow that Eulerian walk $w_j$ until its end and continue to $u_{i+1}$. We do this for all $G'_j$ until we reach $u_k$. This will form an Eulerian walk that visits all edges in $G$ exactly once. I found the last part, where the cycle is re-inserted into the graph again quite hairy to describe properly, but leaving out superfluous details.",,"['discrete-mathematics', 'proof-verification', 'graph-theory']"
