What happens if one looks for $\emptyset^-$? I have this feeling there's something to say for $\emptyset^- = \emptyset$ and $ \emptyset^- = \{\emptyset\}$. In the first case one could argue that you can't find any singletons $\in \emptyset$ and thus the collection should be empty. In the second case it's possible to use the argument that $\emptyset \setminus \emptyset = \emptyset$ and thus the empty set should be in the collection. Could anyone tell me what the right way to argue about this is, please?","A little question about set definitions based on other sets. $X^- = \{X \setminus \{x\} \mid x \in X\}$ is an example of such a set.
