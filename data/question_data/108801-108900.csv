3,Why is the Plancherel measure interesting?,Why is the Plancherel measure interesting?,,"One can average a class function $f:G\to\Bbb C$ for a finite group $G$ by interpreting $f$ as a complex-valued function on the space ${\rm cl}(G)$ of conjugacy classes and computing the expectation $\Bbb E(f(C))$, where $C$ is a class-valued random variable whose distribution is pulled from the uniform one on $G$. In light of $\sum(\dim\rho)^2=|G|$ (where the sum is over complex irreps $\rho$), we could equally attach the weights $(\dim\rho)^2/|G|$ to irreps and turn $\widehat{G}$ into a probability space. This is how we get the Plancherel measure on a finite group. But what question is the Plancherel measure an answer to? Historically, we know the Lebesgue and more generally the Haar measure answer the question of translation-invariant measures, and do so nicely (existence and uniqueness). Is there some a priori system of nice properties we might have liked a measure on irreps to have, which we could have later discovered the Plancherel measure uniquely satisfies? For $G$ locally compact abelian, the complex irreps comprising $\widehat{G}$ are $1$-dimensional and form a group under tensoring - this is just the dual group, which has its own topology (the compact-open topology), and the Plancherel measure is just the Haar measure. However if $G$ is nonabelian, the irreps can be higher-dimensional and so aren't closed under tensor product. (Pontryagin duality generalizes to Tannaka-Krein duality, where we look at symmetry of the tensor operation on the full category of reps to recover $G$, at least as I understand it.) I may be muddying the waters with infinite nonabelian $G$ though, as I don't know how to define the Plancherel measure in that context. We know conjugacy classes are dual to irreducible representations (see Qiaochu's answer here ; the tl;dr version is that they are identified with the maxspecs of two algebras in a dual pairing). They are not generally in bijection, but one situation where they are in bijection is with finite symmetric groups.

This is an exercise from a book, and it is in the section on finite abelian groups, so I know I have to use the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups. I have come up with a proof, but it seems a bit messy, and I'm not entirely sure if it's correct. It is given below. Let the order of $G$ be $m$ = $p_1^{\alpha_1} \ldots p_k^{\alpha_k}$. It is known that $G$ is a direct product of $p$-groups, say: $$G = G_1 \times \ldots \times G_k$$ where each $G_i$ is a $p_i$-group. By the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups, each $G_i$ is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of the form $$\mathbb{Z}_{{p_i}^{\beta_1}} \times \ldots \times \mathbb{Z}_{{p_i}^{\beta_l}},$$ where $\beta_1, \ldots, \beta_l$ are positive integers such that $\sum_{j=1}^l \beta_j = \alpha_i$. Now if $n$ divides $m$, then we must have $$n = p_1^{\gamma_1} \ldots p_k^{\gamma_k}$$ for some $\gamma_1, \ldots, \gamma_k$ with $0 \leq \gamma_i \leq \alpha_i$. Claim : Each $G_i$ has a subgroup of order $p_i^{\gamma_i}$ Proof : As above, we have that $$ G_i \cong \mathbb{Z}_{{p_i}^{\beta_1}} \times \ldots \times \mathbb{Z}_{{p_i}^{\beta_l}} $$ where $\beta_1, \ldots, \beta_l$ are positive integers such that $\sum_{j=1}^l \beta_j = \alpha_i$. Now since $0 \leq \gamma_i \leq \alpha_i$, we can find   $l$ numbers $\delta_1, \ldots , \delta_l$ such that $\gamma_i = \sum_{j=1}^l \delta_j$, and $0 \leq \delta_j \leq \beta_j$. (This choice of numbers is not necessarily unique). Then $p_i^{\delta_j} | p_i^{\beta_j}$ for each $j = 1, \ldots , l$. Hence, for each factor $\mathbb{Z}_{{p_i}^{\beta_j}}$, there exists a subgroup of order $p_i^{\delta_j}$, namely $\mathbb{Z}_{{p_i}^{\delta_j}}$ (using the fact that the converse of Lagrange's theorem is true for finite cyclic groups). Taking the direct product of each of these subgroups, we get a new subgroup $G_i'$ of $G_i$: $$G_i' \cong \mathbb{Z}_{{p_i}^{\delta_1}} \times \ldots \times \mathbb{Z}_{{p_i}^{\delta_l}}$$ The order of this subgroup is $p_i^{\delta_1} \times \ldots \times p_i^{\delta_l} = p_i^{\delta_1 + \ldots + \delta_l} = p_i^{\gamma_i} $. So we have found a subgroup of $G_i$ of order $p_i^{\gamma_i}$, as required. So each factor $G_i$ in the product $G = G_1 \times \ldots \times G_k$ has a subgroup $G_i'$ of order $p_i^{\gamma_i}$.

The answer might of course rely on other mathematical fields,  like topology, or even be related to some physical constraints that hold for both brains and common CPUs but are not strictly constrainted by mathematical characteristics.

Show that $N\le Z(G)$. (By the way, this problem has been posed on this site before.) The proof that I guided them through goes like this: all the conjugacy classes of $G$ have odd order; since $N$ is normal, it is a union of conjugacy classes. The only possibilities are $3$, $1$, $1$, and five $1$'s. In either case, $N$ contains a nonidentity element whose conjugacy class consists only of itself, so it is in $Z(G)$; but that element generates $N\cong \mathbb{Z}/5$ and the result follows. So let $S(p)$ be the following statement: If $G$ is a finite group of odd order and $N$ is a normal subgroup of order $p$, then $N\le Z(G)$. For which (odd) $p$ does this hold? The argument above shows that it holds for $p=5$, but pretty clearly that proof will not work for $p>5$.

These two arbitrary elements commute iff \begin{equation} [g_2Ng_1N]^{-1}[g_1Ng_2N] \in G_i/N \end{equation} which is equivalent to the condition $g_1^{-1}g_2^{-1}g_1g_2 \in G_i$. Since we have that the quotient $G_{i+1}/G_i$ is abelian we know that $(g_1G_i)(g_2G_i)=(g_2G_i)(g_1 G_i)$ which gives precisely this condition. We conclude that quotient groups of solvable groups are solvable. Is my solution correct? If not, please help me fix it. Thanks!",,"['group-theory', 'proof-verification']"

Namely, a group is just a pair $(X,a)$ where $X$ is a set and $a \in G(X)$ . The homomorphisms make some trouble, though. A homomorphism $(X,a) \to (Y,b)$ should be a map $f : X \to Y$ such that some property is satisfied, but I don't see how to express it in terms of $G(X)$ and $G(Y)$ alone. If $f$ is bijective , then we have an induced map $f_* : G(X) \to G(Y)$ , and the condition is just $f_*(a)=b$ .

The problem is that $U$ is an iso-fibration, but not a fibration or an opfibration. Let me know if I should clarify the question further.

67,Visualized group tables for $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$,Visualized group tables for  and,\mathbb{Z} \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z},"Let me share a kind of visualization of group tables which is especially well suited for cyclic groups like $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ . In these groups you can easily give colors to each group member $k$ with hue = red if $k > 0$ (for $\mathbb{Z}$ ) or $k \leq n/2$ (for $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ ) hue = blue otherwise lightness = goes from 0 to 1 for $|k|\rightarrow \infty$ (for $\mathbb{Z}$ ) or for $k \rightarrow n/2$ (for $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ ) So $k=0$ always looks black while $k = \infty$ resp. $k=n/2$ looks white. My question is: Which specific number- or group- or ring-theoretic facts can be learned from looking at   these group tables? It comes as no surprise that all addition group tables for $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ look essentially the same, independent of the nature of $n$ (be it prime or whatsoever): But also the multiplication group tables exhibit quite regular patterns.

I've studied some abstract algebra, to the level of Dummit & Foote on groups, rings and fields. I also have studied general topology and some very basic algebraic topology if that's of any use, and I'm diving into number theory right now. Hopefully this helps answers understand what ""level"" I'm at. As a further note, it is obviously too early for me to know what I will be studying as a research mathematician, but I think it's unlikely that I'll become a finite group theorist. In any case, I hope that doesn't mean I'm doomed to never understand the Monster, moonshine, and the $j$-function.",,"['group-theory', 'soft-question', 'finite-groups']"
