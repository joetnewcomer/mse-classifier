2,Prove that there's no fractions that can't be written in lowest term with Well Ordering Principle,Prove that there's no fractions that can't be written in lowest term with Well Ordering Principle,,"This is from Class Note from 6.042 ocw courses at MIT: ""Well Ordering Principle"" section: ( Sorry for not posting latex; I have less than 10 reputations to post images ) You can read the original here at page 1 and 2; Well Ordering Principle: http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/readings/MIT6_042JF10_chap03.pdf In fact, looking back, we took the Well Ordering Principle for granted   in proving that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational. That   proof assumed that for any positive integers $m$ and $n$, the fraction $\frac{m}{n}$   can be written in lowest terms, that is, in the form $\frac{m'}{n'}$ where $m'$   and $n'$ are positive integers with no common factors. How do we know   this is always possible? Suppose to the contrary that there were $m$, $n$ in $\mathbb{Z}^+$ such that the fraction $\frac{m}{n}$ cannot be written in lowest   terms. Now let $C$ be the set of positive integers that are numerators   of such fractions. Then $m$ in $C$, so $C$ is nonempty. Therefore, by Well   Ordering, there must be a smallest integer, $m_0$ in $C$. So by definition of   $C$, there is an integer $n_0 > 0$ such that the fraction $\frac{m_0}{n_0}$ cannot be   written in lowest terms. This means that $m_0$ and $n_0$ must have a common   factor, $p > 1$. But $(\frac{m_0}{p}) / (\frac{n_0}{p}) = \frac{m_0}{n_0}$ so any way of expressing the left hand fraction in lowest terms would   also work for $\frac{m_0}{n_0}$, which implies the fraction($\frac{m_0}{p}) / (\frac{n_0}{p})$ cannot be in written in lowest terms either. So by definition of $C$, the numerator, $\frac{m_0}{p}$, is in $C$. But $\frac{m_0}{p} < m_0$,   which contradicts the fact that $m_0$ is the smallest element of $C$. Since   the assumption that $C$ is nonempty leads to a contradiction, it follows   that $C$ must be empty. That is, that there are no numerators of   fractions that can’t be written in lowest terms, and hence there are   no such fractions at all. I don't really understand the part where, the author says: So by definition of $C$, there is an integer $n_0 > 0$ such that: $\frac{m_0}{n_0}$ cannot be written in lowest terms.

Let's call a set $B\subset \{0,1\}^n$ balanced if its center of mass is the center of the cube; that is, the average of all vectors contained in $B$ is $(1/2,\dots,1/2)$. What is the smallest possible diameter of a nonempty balanced subset of $\{0,1\}^n$? Partial results Let $d_n$ be the aforementioned smallest diameter, and let $B$ be a balanced set that realizes it. Without loss of generality, $B$ contains the zero vector $(0,\dots,0)$. To be balanced, it must also contain some vector with more $1$s than $0$s. Hence $$ d_n \ge \left\lceil \frac{n+1}{2} \right\rceil \tag{1} $$ The Cartesian product of two balanced sets is balanced, and its diameter is the sum of diameters of its factors.

Would appreciate a review of a/b and a hint for c if possible. Restatement here: For n = 40, the value of polynomial $p(n)::=n^2 + n + 41$ is not prime, as noted in Section 1.1.

In particular, let $q(n)$ be a polynomial with integer coefﬁcients, and let $c::=q(0)$ be the constant term of q. (a) Verify that $q(cm)$ is a multiple of c for all $m \in Z$ Proof: Since q is a polynomial, it will be of the form: $q(x) = a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_1x + c$ If $x = cm$, then notice that cm will be inside every term of the polynomial, and since the final term is c, c can be factored out of every term.

Proof: Continuing from the result found in (a), it is easy to see that for all $m \in Z$, there will be an infinite number of multiples of c that will be generated by q. Since c > 1, these multiples are guaranteed not to be prime. c) Conclude that for every nonconstant polynomial, q, there must be an $n \in N$ such that $q(n)$ is not prime. Hint: Only one easy case remains. c = 0 is trivially easy to prove using the (b) above. I assume the ""easy"" case is referring to c = 1, but in this case I'm not sure how to continue, since the result of (a) and (b) don't apply: I can't use them since adding 1 to any even number may make it prime. If the result of the terms not including c is odd, then adding 1 to that result makes it even and it is not prime.

11,Why does universal generalization work? (the rule of inference),Why does universal generalization work? (the rule of inference),,"This is an excerpt from Discrete Mathematics. Universal generalization is the rule of inference that states that ∀xP(x) is true, given the premise that P(c) is true for all elements c in the domain. Universal generalization is used when we show that ∀xP(x) is true by taking an arbitrary element c from the domain and showing that P(c) is true. The element c that we select must be an arbitrary, and not a specific, element of the domain. That is, when we assert from ∀xP(x) the existence of an element c in   the domain, we have no control over c and cannot make any other   assumptions about c other than it comes from the domain. Universal   generalization is used implicitly in many proofs in mathematics and is   seldom mentioned explicitly. However, the error of adding unwarranted   assumptions about the arbitrary element c when universal   generalization is used is all too common in incorrect reasoning. I have two questions: 1. What is meant by the second paragraph ? 2. How come just by taking arbitrary c in domain, we can conclude that if P(c) is true then so is ∀xP(x).

That is, when we assert from ∀xP(x) the existence of an element c in   the domain, we have no control over c and cannot make any other   assumptions about c other than it comes from the domain. Universal   generalization is used implicitly in many proofs in mathematics and is   seldom mentioned explicitly. However, the error of adding unwarranted   assumptions about the arbitrary element c when universal   generalization is used is all too common in incorrect reasoning. I have two questions: 1. What is meant by the second paragraph ? 2. How come just by taking arbitrary c in domain, we can conclude that if P(c) is true then so is ∀xP(x).

Here is an example where $n = 6$ and infected students are marked ×. Example. Now the infection begins to spread every minute (in discrete time-steps). Two students are considered adjacent if they share an edge (i.e., front, back, left or right, but NOT diagonal); thus, each student is adjacent to $2, 3,$ or $4$ others. A student is infected in the next time step if either: the student was previously infected (since beaver flu lasts forever), or the student is adjacent to at least two already-infected students. In the example, the infection spreads as shown below. Example. In this example, over the next few time-steps, all the students in class become infected. Theorem. If fewer than $n$ students in class are initially infected, the whole class will never be completely infected. Prove this theorem. Hint: When one wants to understand how a system such as the above “evolves” over time, it is usually a good strategy to (1) identify an appropriate property of the system at the initial stage, and (2) prove, by induction on the number of time-steps, that the property is preserved at every time-step. So look for a property (of the set of infected students) that remains invariant as time proceeds. Source: MIT OCW Mathematics for Computer Science, Problem Set 2, Problem 3. I am not really sure of how I can prove this. I went out on a limb and assumed that I would be using induction since this seems like a problem that requires an invariant to be used to prove the theorem. Another thing that I have realized is that if $k$ students are initially infected, then the perimeter of the figure formed by the infected students as the infection spread is at most $4k$. So, this might be my invariant. So, this is what I have thus far: Theorem: If fewer than $n$ students in class are initially infected, the whole class will never be completely infected.

Two students are considered adjacent if they share an edge (i.e., front, back, left or right, but NOT diagonal); thus, each student is adjacent to $2, 3,$ or $4$ others. A student is infected in the next time step if either: the student was previously infected (since beaver flu lasts forever), or the student is adjacent to at least two already-infected students. In the example, the infection spreads as shown below. Example. In this example, over the next few time-steps, all the students in class become infected. Theorem. If fewer than $n$ students in class are initially infected, the whole class will never be completely infected. Prove this theorem. Hint: When one wants to understand how a system such as the above “evolves” over time, it is usually a good strategy to (1) identify an appropriate property of the system at the initial stage, and (2) prove, by induction on the number of time-steps, that the property is preserved at every time-step. So look for a property (of the set of infected students) that remains invariant as time proceeds. Source: MIT OCW Mathematics for Computer Science, Problem Set 2, Problem 3. I am not really sure of how I can prove this. I went out on a limb and assumed that I would be using induction since this seems like a problem that requires an invariant to be used to prove the theorem. Another thing that I have realized is that if $k$ students are initially infected, then the perimeter of the figure formed by the infected students as the infection spread is at most $4k$. So, this might be my invariant. So, this is what I have thus far: Theorem: If fewer than $n$ students in class are initially infected, the whole class will never be completely infected. Proof: by induction I would appreciate any and all hints that would help me get the ball rolling with this proof.",,"['discrete-mathematics', 'invariance']"

Possible Duplicate: Show that $f_0 - f_1 + f_2 - \cdots - f_{2n-1} + f_{2n} = f_{2n-1} - 1$ when $n$ is a positive integer This is a homework question so I'm looking to just be nudged in the right direction, I'm not asking for my work to be done for me. The Fibonacci numbers are defined as follows: $f_0 = 0$, $f_1 = 1$, and $f_{n+2} = f_n + f_{n+1}$ whenever $n \geq 0$.

When $A$ and $B$ are propositions, then $A \to B$ is the proposition with the truth table that is only false when $p$ is true and $q$ is false. When proving a theorem something is assumed to be true.

And $\implies$ in $B$ doesn't make sense because I am not asserting anything. This would be the same reason that if I make the theorem that: for all real numbers $x$ , $x^2 = 1 \implies x = 1$ , then this is an incorrect theorem. If I make the definition saying that a real number $x$ is foo if $x^2 = 1 \implies x =1$ , then the only number that is foo is $1$ . Is all this correct?

On the other hand, I could be completely wrong about my reasoning. Also just for clarity's sake: Would $A\cup B = A \cup C$ and $A \cap B = A \cap C$ be proven in a similar way to show whether or not the conditions imply $B = C$?

69,Proof of clockwise towers of Hanoi variant recursive solution,Proof of clockwise towers of Hanoi variant recursive solution,,"This is from one of the exercises in "" Concrete Mathematics "", and is something I'm doing privately, not homework. This is a variant on the classic towers of Hanoi, where all moves must be made clockwise only. The recursive solution is to consider $Q_n$ to be the number of moves to move a tower size $n$ one step across (e.g. from start $\rightarrow$ end post), and $R_n$ to be the number of moves to move it two (e.g start $\rightarrow$ end $\rightarrow$ spare). The recursive solution is (sorry about the formatting, just getting to grips with tex): $Q_n = 0 \quad \text{if n = 0}$ $Q_n = 2R_{n-1} + 1\quad \text{if n > 0}$ $R_n = 0 \quad \text{if n = 0}$ $R_n = Q_n + Q_{n-1} + 1 \quad \text{if n > 0}$ How can I prove these? I presume an inductive proof is required but everything I've tried to do just gets garbled into a mess of further decreasing $n$ values. Explaining why these work is simple enough: $Q_n$ can be explained by the fact that you need to move a stack of size $n-1$ two steps forward followed by the $n$ piece, followed by moving the $n-1$ stack two steps again onto the $n$ piece=> $Q_n = R_{n-1} + 1 + R_{n-1} = 2R_{n-1}+1$. The wordy proof for $R_n$ is similar: It consists of moving $R_{n-1}$ then 1 followed by $Q_n$, 1 and $R_{n-1}$ which will end us up with $R_n = 2R_{n-1}+1+Q_{n-1}+1 = Q_n+Q_{n-1}+1$ But these are all just words that don't form any real proof... I've gone over the leading chapter and looked up some resources on proof by induction, but doing it with a recursion with two components has put me for a spin (having forgotten a lot of the math studied in the past certainly isn't helping either). If someone could run me through a rigorous proof for $n > 0$ it would be much appreciated. As an aside, any recommended learning resources on proof by induction would be appreciated as I'm still barely ""getting it"".","This is from one of the exercises in "" Concrete Mathematics "", and is something I'm doing privately, not homework.

Let $f : G \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ be a function on the vertices such that $|f(v) - f(w)| \leq 1$ if $v$ and $w$ are adjacent.  Show that at least $n$ of those vertices have the same $f$-value. Aside for those interested in Go: I remember my proof used some reductions where I ended up proving that the groups in Go with the fewest liberties for the amount of stones invested are those which are clumped in the corner.   I now have no idea how this relates to the problem at all so if you can see what I was thinking at the time, it would be nice to know. Further questions that I find interesting: Sorry if open ended discussion is not what this site is about, just some other thoughts I had after typing this out.  I was wondering about what can we say about other graphs satisfying this bounded difference property.  The more connected a graph is, the larger the necessarily largest amount of equal $f$-values there has to be is.  $K_n$ has to have $\lceil n/2\rceil $ equal $f$-values.  Is there some standard property of a graph we can use to determine this number?  What about other higher dimensional square lattices? Thanks.",,"['graph-theory', 'discrete-mathematics']"

86,Worst case in decanting puzzles (pouring water from one jug to others).,Worst case in decanting puzzles (pouring water from one jug to others).,,"A classic puzzle is to start with $3$ jugs of nonzero integer capacity ($A \ge B \ge C$) and have some water (integer) in each jug (the initial position). The goal is to get to some final (integer) state. Of course, the question makes sense with n jugs, and possibly with a source and/or a sink (which I do not allow in the $3$-jug case). The solution of a particular case is the same as finding a shortest-path in a certain graph. My question is whether any bounds are known on the number of steps needed. I (and Rob Pratt) have checked the special case where the total amount of water in the initial state is at most A. We checked all choices of the capacities under $100$ and in all cases the longest shortest path (the diameter of the graph) has length (number of edges, which is same as number of pouring steps) at most $A+1$. Without the initial water restriction, the solution length might well be unbounded. I do know that the graph is best studied in barycentric coordinates, and then a pouring sequence corresponds to a billiard path in a certain polygon. Example for $A+1$:  Use jugs $(A,A,2)$ where $A$ is odd. The shortest path from $(A,0,0)$ to $(A-1,1,0)$ takes $A+1$ steps. I will soon submit a demo to the Wolfram site that shows the graph and the solution for any choice of jugs, start, and finish.

I understand that q unless (not p) is the same as saying p implies q, but I'm not sure how to exactly apply that rule here for this sentence. Is it equivalent to saying (by rearranging the sentence a bit): Unless every input value is tested (call it proposition ""p""), unless the correctness of the program is established (call it proposition ""q""), no amount of testing can show it produces the desired output for all input values (call it proposition ""r""). or If every input value is not tested, then if the correctness of the program is not established, no amount of testing can show it produces the desired output for all input values. or (not p) --> ( (not q) --> r) or ( (not p) and (not q) ) --> r Kindly please help me here.

98,How to show that a large given integer isn't a square number by using mod?,How to show that a large given integer isn't a square number by using mod?,,Given a big integer like $4531893869$ the question is how to show that this number isn't a square number using mod $11$. Basically what we have is something like that: $$ 4531893869 \equiv x \pmod{11}$$ and we know that $ x \in \{1\ldots10\}$. According to Wolfram Alpha the result is $8$. But I don't understand how this will show us that this large number isn't a square number. I have to explicitly use mod $11$ to solve this task but I don't understand the mathematical context.,Given a big integer like $4531893869$ the question is how to show that this number isn't a square number using mod $11$.
