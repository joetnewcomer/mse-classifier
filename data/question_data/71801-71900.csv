We shall construct a sequence $\{V_{n}\}$ of neighborhoods as follows. Let $V_1$ be any neighborhood of $\mathbf{x_1}$ . If $V_1$ consists of all $y\in \mathbb{R}^k$ such that $|y−x_1|<r$ , the closure $\overline{V_1}$ of $V_1$ is the set of all $y\in \mathbb{R}^k$ such that $|y−x_1|≤r$ .

Does it still hold that the Borel $\sigma$-algebra on $X\times Y$ is the same as the product $\sigma$-algebra of the Borel $\sigma$-algebras on $X$ and $Y$? I tried taking an arbitrary open set $A$ in $X\times Y$. Since $X$ is second countable, there exists a countable basis $\{U_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$. So for any $n$ and $\epsilon>0$, set $$V_{n,\epsilon}=\{y\in Y\mid\text{ for some }\delta>0, U_n\times B_{\epsilon+\delta}(y)\subset A\}.$$ [Here $B_r(s)$ is the ball centered at $s$ of radius $r$.] I was then trying to show that $A$ can be written as an arbitrary union of sets of form $U_n\times V_{n,\epsilon}$, with $\epsilon$ possibly varying, to prove it.

A function is open if the image of an open set is open. Uniformity continuity can be defined in a similar way as continuity. A map $f$ between two uniform spaces is uniformly continuous if the inverse image (under $f \times f$) of an entourage is an entourage. Now consider the following ""uniform analog"" of openness: the image (under $f \times f$) of an entourage is an entourage. Question . Was this property studied? And if yes, is there a well-established name for it? Motivation. I need this property in a very special case and I am looking for references.","In topology, a function is continuous if the inverse image of an open set is open.

99,"Prove if metric space $X$ contains a connected dense subset, then $X$ is connected. [duplicate]","Prove if metric space  contains a connected dense subset, then  is connected. [duplicate]",X X,"This question already has an answer here : Let $A$ be a dense subset of $X$ and suppose $A$ is connected in the induced subspace topology, then $X$ is also connected (1 answer) Closed 5 years ago . I am attempting to solve the following question. Q. Suppose a metric space $X$ contains a connected dense subset $A$. Show that $X$ is connected. Here is my attempt at a solution: A. Assume to the contrary that $X$ is not connected, that is, let $X=U \cup V$ where $U$ and $V$ are two disjoint, non-empty, open sets.  Since $A$ is dense, we have that $cl(A)=U \cup V$ and since $X$ is a metric space, then $A \subseteq U \cup V$... This is where I get stuck. I'd like to show that $A$ is not dense, but I'm not really sure where to go from here.  Any help would be appreciated!","This question already has an answer here : Let $A$ be a dense subset of $X$ and suppose $A$ is connected in the induced subspace topology, then $X$ is also connected (1 answer) Closed 5 years ago .
