0,Is it necessary for $A$ to be symmetric with non-zero determinant?,Is it necessary for  to be symmetric with non-zero determinant?,A,"Today, in a Differential Geometry test, I was asked to prove that: $$S:=\{x \in \mathbb{R}^3: x^TAx+c=0\}$$ where $A$ is a symmetric $3\times 3$ matrix  and $c \in \mathbb{R}$ is a regular surface whenever $\det A \neq 0$ and $c \neq 0$. Talking to a friend, he gave me his resolution: (Let's, first, define: $$f: \mathbb{R}^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$ $$x \mapsto \langle Ax,x\rangle$$ If you assume that $A$ is symmetric, the gradient of $f$ in $p$ is $Ap$. Since $c \neq 0$, we have that if $p \in S$, $p$ must not be $0$. Since $\det A \neq 0$, we have that $Ap$ is not $0$, and therefore the derivative is surjective and every point of $S$ is regular. I gave another solution, where I don't use the fact that $A$ is symmetric and neither the fact that $\det A$ is different than $0$. Therefore, I suspect that there may be something wrong, which I ask of you to verify if that's the case: Solution : The derivative of the map $x \mapsto \langle Ax,x\rangle$ at a point $p$ is the linear map: $$f'(x)=\langle A (~~\cdot~~),p\rangle + \langle Ap,~~\cdot~~\rangle$$ Take a point $p \in S$. We know that $\langle Ap,p\rangle=-c$. We show that the derivative is surjective. For that, since it is a linear functional, it is sufficient to show that it is not the zero functional.

And I think I'm stuck at a relatively simple question. On page 11 he is defining a coboundary map $b : H^k_{2, \text{reduced}}(M - K) \to H^{k+1}(K, \partial K)$, while $K$ is a smooth, compact submanifold of a complete manifold $M$ and $H^{k+1}(K,\partial K)$ is the relative cohomology group of K and $H^k_{2, \text{reduced}}(M - K)$ is the reduced $L^2$ de Rham cohomology. The coboundary map is defined as follows: For $c \in H^k_{2, \text{reduced}}(M - K)$ take a smooth representative $\alpha$ of $c$, choose a smooth extension $\bar\alpha \in C^\infty(\Lambda^kT^*M)$. $d\bar\alpha$ is a closed form and zero on $M - K$. Now we define $b(c) = [d\bar\alpha] \in H^{k+1}(K, \partial K)$. But how can I show that this doesn't depend on my choice of the smooth representative of $c$?",,"['differential-geometry', 'homology-cohomology', 'differential-forms', 'hodge-theory']"

Here's the course descriptions in my school: Differential Geometry - ""In this course, we understand the theory of curves and surfaces, then we investigate differential and integral calculus on surfaces"" Differential Manifold - "" Linear Algebra, calculus and 1 year analysis are prerequisites to this course "" My questions: is it possible to study differential manifold without studying differential geometry, complex analysis and multivariable calculus? This is a very important question to me.. When i studied RCA-rudin, it's written in the index that ""only first 8 chapters of PMA are enough to start this book"", but frankly it was not.
