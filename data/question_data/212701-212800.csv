4,Which trigonometric identities involve trigonometric functions?,Which trigonometric identities involve trigonometric functions?,,"Once upon a time, when Wikipedia was only three-and-a-half years old and most people didn't know what it was, the article titled functional equation gave the identity $$ \sin^2\theta+\cos^2\theta = 1 $$ as an example of a functional equation.  In this edit in July 2004, my summary said ""I think the example recently put here is really lousy, because it's essentially just an algebraic equation in two variables.""  (Then some subsequent edits I did the same day brought the article to this state, and much further development of the article has happened since then.) The fact that it's really only an algebraic equation in two variables, $x^2+y^2=1$, makes it a lousy example of a functional equation.  It doesn't really involve $x$ and $y$ as functions of $\theta$, since any other parametrization of the circle would have satisfied the same equation.  In a sense, that explains why someone like Norman Wildberger can do all sorts of elaborate things with trigonometry without ever using trigonometric functions. But some trigonometric identities do involve trigonometric functions, e.g. $$ \sin(\theta_1+\theta_2)=\sin\theta_1\cos\theta_2+\cos\theta_1\sin\theta_2 $$ $$ \sec(\theta_1+\cdots+\theta_n) = \frac{\sec\theta_1\cdots\sec\theta_n}{e_0-e_2+e_4-e_6+\cdots} $$ where $e_k$ is the $k$th-degree elementary symmetric polynomial in $\tan\theta_1,\ldots,\tan\theta_n$.  These are good examples of satisfaction of functional equations. So at this point I wonder whether all trigonometric identities that do seem to depend on which parametrization of the circle is chosen involve adding or subtracting the arguments and no other operations.  In some cases the addition or subtraction is written as a condition on which the identity depends, e.g. $$ \text{If }x+y+z=\pi\text{ then }\tan x+\tan y+\tan z = \tan x\tan y\tan z. $$ QUESTION: Do all trigonometric identities that do involve trigonometric functions, in the sense that they are good examples of satisfaction of functional equations by trigonometric functions, get their non-triviality as such examples only from the addition or subtraction of arguments?

Given the usual elementary knowledge of triangles when one is first introduced to these functions, I think it appears pretty arbitrary.

18,Why are the trigonometric functions so important?,Why are the trigonometric functions so important?,,"The basic functions of trigonometry, $\sin$ and $\cos$, are ubiquitous in mathematics. They were originally conceived from geometry, and so it's not surprising that they consistently show up in elementary geometry contexts. Many other appearances of these functions I find shocking, though. We have of course the famous result, $$e^{ix} = \cos x + i\sin x,$$ which connects them to exponentiation. They also appear in relation to other famous functions, such as in the formulas $$\Gamma(z)\Gamma(1-z)=\frac{\pi}{\sin \pi z},$$ $$\zeta(s) = 2^s \pi^{s-1}\sin\left( \frac{\pi s}{2}\right)\Gamma(1-s)\zeta(1-s). \tag{1}$$ I find these particularly surprising because the Riemann zeta function is closely tied to prime numbers, for example in the formula $$\zeta(s) = \prod_{p\ \text{prime}} \frac{1}{1-1/p^s} \tag{2}.$$ If I had never heard of trigonometry, and you defined $\sin$ and $\cos$ for me in terms of the unit circle (ignoring non-real values of $s$), and then told me that the expressions in $(1)$ and $(2)$ are equivalent, I'd probably call you a lying idiot!

Right now you may be imagining this version of the half angle formulas $$\sin{\frac{\alpha}{2}}=\pm\sqrt{\frac{1-\cos{\alpha}}{2}}\qquad\qquad\cos{\frac{\alpha}{2}}=\pm\sqrt{\frac{1+\cos{\alpha}}{2}},$$ that do appear in the textbooks of the first trigonometry courses (at least with the one I studied).

58,Smooth sawtooth wave $y(x)=\cos(x-\cos(x-\cos(x-\dots)))$,Smooth sawtooth wave,y(x)=\cos(x-\cos(x-\cos(x-\dots))),"Consider an infinite recursive function $$y(x)=\cos(x-\cos(x-\cos(x-\dots)))$$ $$y=\cos(x-y)$$ Plotting the function $y(x)$ implicitly we get a smooth sawtooth-like wave: Was this function studied before? For example, its derivative, Fourier series or other properties. It may be useful in electronics or other applications. I can find the expression for its derivative in terms of $y$ and $x$, but I do not know how to plot it effectively (without tabulating it by recursive formula for $y$). $$y'(x)=-\frac{\sin(x-y)}{1-\sin(x-y)}$$ We obtain the correct expression for the maxima and minima of the function. (Note that the first positive maximum is at $x=1$ and the first minimum is at $x=\pi-1$, which is confirmed by numerical computation). Since the function is smooth, the derivative should be finite everywhere. Does this mean that the denominator in this expression can never be equal to $0$? By the way, the recursive formula itself is not a fluke - I checked its convergence numerically in Mathematica and it seems to converge for all values. However, for the values close to the 'vertical lines' the convergence is slower than for the rest. Edit The function is not smooth, because its derivative is not defined at $x=\frac{\pi}{2}+2\pi n$ and $y=0$ as cardboard_box pointed out and as can be seen from the expression. Oh, it's just vertical tangents apparently Update I wanted to illustrate the very helpful answers and comments I've been given so far. First, credit goes to Lucian for introducing me to Clausen function (see the first comment below). However, this function does not have vertical tangents anywhere, as you can see in the graph (I plotted Clausen using its Fourier series, since it's easier than the integral definition): So, the function I defined here is much more ""sawtooth-like"". And finally, davik gave the parametric form for the function and figured out its Fourier series, which I plot below: You may notice I displaced and reversed the original function when plotting these graphs. We can also use sine instead of cosine if needed. Now the final question that I wanted to ask: Has anyone seen this function anywhere?

Out of curiosity, I tried to rotate the book by holding the spine and observe how much it can rotate, until three of the vertices touched a point of the drawer.

This expression has no explicit infinite series or products or obviously tweaked constants. Admittedly, the constant 18 was tweaked, but is does not look tweaked (I would prefer to say it is reverse engineered ). The expression was derived as follows: The starting formula involves the Liouville function $\lambda(n)$ . It is either $+1$ or $-1$ , depending on whether the number of factors in the prime factorization of $n$ is even or odd ( $\lambda(1)=+1$ , as $1$ has $0$ prime factors). $$\frac{\zeta(2s)}{\zeta(s)}=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\lambda(n)}{n^s}$$ where $s>1$ It can be derived from Euler's product formula for $\zeta(2s)$ . Now the terms of $\zeta(s)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^s}$ can be separated on the basis of the value of $\lambda(n)$ . $$\zeta_+(s)=\frac 12 \left(\zeta(s)+\frac{\zeta(2s)}{\zeta(s)}\right)$$ is the sum of the terms having $\lambda(n)=+1$ . $$\zeta_-(s)=\frac 12 \left(\zeta(s)-\frac{\zeta(2s)}{\zeta(s)}\right)$$ is the (positive) sum of the (absolute value of the) terms having $\lambda(n)=-1$ . The following three relations hold: $$\zeta_+(s)+\zeta_-(s)=\zeta(s)$$ $$\zeta_+(s)-\zeta_-(s)=\frac{\zeta(2s)}{\zeta(s)}$$ and, multiplying the two relations above: $$\zeta_+(s)^2-\zeta_-(s)^2=\zeta(2s)=\left(\sqrt{\zeta(2s)}\right)^2$$ or $$\zeta_+(s)^2=\left(\sqrt{\zeta(2s)}\right)^2+\zeta_-(s)^2$$ The latter is the the Pythagorean equation for a right triangle with hypotenuse length $\zeta_+(s)$ and right angle sides lengths $\sqrt{\zeta(2s)}$ and $\zeta_-(s)$ . If we call the angle between the hypotenuse and the $\sqrt{\zeta(2s)}$ side $\alpha(s)$ , then $$\sin(\alpha(s))=\frac{\zeta_-(s)}{\zeta_+(s)}=\frac{\zeta(s)-{\zeta(2s)\over \zeta(s)}}{\zeta(s)+{\zeta(2s)\over \zeta(s)}}=\frac{1-{\zeta(2s)\over \zeta(s)^2}}{1+{\zeta(2s)\over \zeta(s)^2}}=q(s)$$ The rightmost fraction is also defined in the limit $\lim_{s\to 1}$ . So $\alpha(s)=\arcsin(q(s))$ , $\cos(\alpha(s))=\frac{\sqrt{\zeta(2s)}}{\zeta_+(s)}$ , $\tan(\alpha(s))=\frac{\zeta_-(s)}{\sqrt{\zeta(2s)}}$ , which gives $$\zeta(s)=\zeta_+(s)+\zeta_-(s)=\sqrt{\zeta(2s)}\left(\frac{1}{\cos(\alpha(s))}+\tan(\alpha(s))\right)$$ Plugging in s=3, with numerical values values for $\zeta(3)$ and $\zeta(6)$ from WolframAlpha , one finds $\alpha(3)=\arcsin(q(3))=$ 0.1745439... $=$ π/17.99886... in radians, or 10.0006...° in degrees.
