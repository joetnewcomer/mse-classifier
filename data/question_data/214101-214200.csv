Radians not degrees for the trigonometric functions. This area is exactly the same as the area enclosed by each infinitely repeating pattern in the graph $\cos (x) + \cos (y) = 1$ Graph of $\sin (x) + \sin (y) = 1$ : My working: This area is exactly the same as the area enclosed by each infinitely repeating pattern in the graph $\cos (x) + \cos (y) = 1$ For cosine, the pattern is split symmetrically across all four quadrants of the graph around the origin so integration may be possible to find half of the desired area Solve for y: Subtracting $\cos (x)$ from both sides of the equation: $\cos (y) = 1 - \cos (x)$ Taking inverse cosine of both sides of the equation: $y = \arccos (1 - \cos (x))$ Since the range of the inverse cosine function is $-1 ≤ \arccos (x) ≤ 1$ , if the value of $\cos (x) < 0$ , the value in within the parentheses will be outside of the inverse cosine range and not be valid, so the new function has a minimum of $\arccos(1) = 0$ , likewise, if the maximum y value of $\cos (x)$ would be 1, therefore the other extreme point, the maximum, of the new function would be $\arccos (0) = \frac{\pi}{2}\cdot$ Because any resulting definite integral of this function between any two valid points on the x-axis will be positive, we don't have to consider translating the graph in order to find a more appropriate area-under-the-curve value. We know that, from the graph, provided, that the curve of the function between two valid points will be an arch-shape, similar to the original wave function graphs. So we know that the desired area will be located between two 'paired' roots of the new function, which we can use as parameters for the indefinite integral later. Find two subsequent roots for the function: Set $y = 0$ , so the equation to solve is $\arccos (1 - \cos (x)) = 0$ Take cosine of both sides of the equation: $1 - \cos (x) = \cos (0) = 1$ Replace the subtrahend with the value on the right hand side of the equation: $\cos (x) = 1 - 1 = 0$ Take inverse cosine of both sides: $x = \arccos (0) = \frac{π}{2}$ Since cosine is an even function, all positive roots can be turned negative and still be valid: $\cos (-\frac{π}{2}) = 0$ confirms this in this context. Since the y-intercept is a maximum y-value of the function, we can assume that the shape of the function's curve on both sides of the y-axis are symmetrical and that we have the correct parameters, the diameter of the shape in the graph also seems reasonable and correlates with this conclusion.

It seems suggestive to me that the Golden Ratio involves the square root of five and also appears in the output of the cosine function for inputs proportional to the inverse of five. So I did some digging. The Golden Ratio is a member of the group of numbers which are solutions to the cubic equation $x^3 - a x - 1 = 0$ , with $a = 1$ giving the Plastic Ratio $ρ = \sqrt[3]{\frac{9 + \sqrt{69}}{18}} + \sqrt[3]{\frac{9 - \sqrt{69}}{18}}$ and two complex roots, and $a = 2$ giving the Golden Ratio $φ$ plus the Golden Ratio Conjugate $ψ$ and $-1$ . The value for $a = 3$ does not seem to have a name that I can find, but it does also show up in the cosine function. If we denote the real-valued roots as $R_n(a)$ , going from most positive at $n = 1$ to most negative at $n = 3$ , then $\cos\left(\frac{π}{9}\right) = \frac{R_1(3)}{2} ≈ \frac{1.879385}{2}$ , $\cos\left(\frac{2π}{9}\right) = -\frac{R_3(3)}{2} ≈ -\frac{-1.532089}{2}$ , $\cos\left(\frac{4π}{9}\right) = -\frac{R_2(3)}{2} ≈ -\frac{-0.347296}{2}$ , $\cos\left(\frac{5π}{9}\right) = \frac{R_2(3)}{2} ≈ \frac{-0.347296}{2}$ , $\cos\left(\frac{7π}{9}\right) = \frac{R_3(3)}{2} ≈ \frac{-1.532089}{2}$ , and $\cos\left(\frac{8π}{9}\right) = \frac{-R_1(3)}{2} ≈ -\frac{1.879385}{2}$ . Given that these two sets of roots for $a = 2$ and $a = 3$ show up, it makes me wonder if more do so as well.

I have not derived them for that would make this question unnecessarily lengthier. $$\sin\Big(\dfrac{x}{2}\Big) = \pm \sqrt{\dfrac{1-\cos(x)}{2}}$$ $$\tan\Big(\dfrac{x}{2}\Big) = \pm \sqrt{\dfrac{1-\cos(x)}{1+\cos(x)}}$$ Now, I was looking for an intuitive explanation for the emergence of the $\pm$ symbol in these identities and also an explanation for the fact that the symbol does not appear in the expansion of $f(2\phi)$ in terms of $f(\phi)$ where $f$ is some trigonometric function. I thought of taking the identity $\sin\varphi = \pm \sqrt{1 - \cos^2\varphi}$ as reference. In this identity, the cause of emergence of the $\pm$ symbol seems to be the fact that the value of $\cos\varphi$ alone is not enough information to determine the value of $\sin\varphi$ . In other words, for a given value of $\cos\varphi$ , there are multiple possible values of $\sin\varphi$ (i.e. the value of $\sin\varphi$ is not unique). For example, if $\cos\varphi = \dfrac{1}{2}$ , then two possible values of $\varphi$ for $0 < \varphi \leq 2\pi$ are $\dfrac{\pi}{3}$ and $\dfrac{5\pi}{3}$ and hence, there are two possible values of $\sin\varphi$ , specifically, $\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $\dfrac{-\sqrt{3}}{2}$ . Now, my main question here is that when we talk about one of the three identities that I mentioned above, sy $\cos\Big(\dfrac{x}{2}\Big) = \pm \sqrt{\dfrac{1+\cos(x)}{2}}$ , then what is it tha twe assume to be given to us? Is it just $\cos(x)$ that is given or are the values of all trigonometric functions at $x$ given? I know that the obvious answers looks like the former and you might be wondering how the latter would even imply that the value of $\cos\Big(\dfrac{x}{2}\Big)$ is not unique if all the trigonometric ratios of $x$ are given. Let me elaborate. Let's say that the values of all trigonometric functions at $\alpha$ for some angle $\alpha$ are given to us. Then, for $\alpha \in (0,2\pi]$ , there is one and only one value of $\alpha$ . Let us call that value $\lambda$ . But, when we look past the previous restriction that $\alpha \in (0,2\pi]$ and we look for values of $\alpha$ for $-\infty < \alpha < \infty$ i.e. all possible values of $\alpha$ , then there are infinite possible values of $\alpha$ and all of them are co-terminally related to $\lambda$ . Now, if we take a look at all the possible values of $\alpha$ and for all of them, we evaluate $\cos(2\alpha)$ , we get $\cos(2\lambda)$ in all the cases. This could explain why the $\pm$ symbol does not appear when we express $\cos(2\phi)$ in terms of $\cos\phi$ for some angle $\phi$ . But, I have observed (and mathematically proved) that for all possible values of $\alpha$ that are of the form $(2\pi)n + \lambda$ , where $n$ is an odd, $\cos\Big(\dfrac{\alpha}{2}\Big) = -\cos\Big(\dfrac{\lambda}{2}\Big)$ and where $n$ is even, $\cos\Big(\dfrac{\alpha}{2}\Big) = \cos\Big(\dfrac{\lambda}{2}\Big)$ . Let me provide an example for the sake of clarity. Let $\cos\gamma = \dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $\sin\gamma = \dfrac{1}{2}$ , then $\lambda = \dfrac{\pi}{6}$ and a co-terminal of $\lambda$ whose difference from $\lambda$ is an odd multiple of $2\pi$ is $\dfrac{13\pi}{6}$ . Now, for both these two values, the corresponding values of cosine of half of these angles are : $\dfrac{\sqrt{3}+1}{2\sqrt{2}}$ and $-\dfrac{\sqrt{3}+1}{2\sqrt{2}}$ respectively. So, we have established the fact that if we are provided with the values of all trigonometric functions at an angle, then there are infinitely many possible values of that angle and for all these values, the cosine of two times these angles is always a unique value but this is not the case with the cosine of half of these angles. Now, this result is valid for sine instead of cosine as ell. So, we can also say that the value of sine of half of all the possible values of $\alpha$ is not unique either. This is primarily due to the fact that $f(\pi + \delta) = -f(\delta)$ if $f(x)$ is either $\sin(x)$ or $\cos(x)$ for some angle $\delta$ . But, the period of the tangent function is $\pi$ , unlike the sine and cosine functions, whose period is $2\pi$ . So, if $\mu$ is some angle and we know the values of all trigonometric functions at $\mu$ , then for all the possible values of $\mu$ , the tangent of half of those values will always be unique. So, this caused my previous assumption that the values of all trigonometric functions at the given angle are known to us while solving the problem to completely break down. Conclusion : So, now I think that only the value of $\cos(\alpha)$ is known to us while solving the problem and that makes it way easier to deduce that the value of $f_x\Big(\dfrac{\alpha}{2}\Big)$ is not unique, where $f_x$ is either sine, cosine or tangent. So, I want to know if the way that I finally interpret the cause of emergence of the $\pm$ symbol and how I think that only the value of $\cos(\alpha)$ is known to us in context of these identities is correct.

It was long one, so it was not possible for me to go through it one more time and hence, I would appreciate your help in making this post error-free. Thanks!

If we subtract irrational numbers with different decimal parts or add two irrational numbers whose decimal parts aren't 'complementary' , the result will be irrational as well. $$x\in \mathbb R\setminus \mathbb Q\implies x\ne\frac{m}{n}, \forall m\in \mathbb Z,\forall n\in \mathbb N$$ I considered proving by contradiction but didn't know how to realize it (I wanted to prove $M(m,n)\ne1$ and square $\arccos{\frac{1}{n}}$ ) Another idea was to prove $\arccos{(kx)}, k\in \mathbb Z\setminus\{0\}$ . There are many tools I didn't know which to choose.","Let be odd. Prove that all solutions to the equation: are irrational.

97,tangent inequality in triangle,tangent inequality in triangle,,"Let $a$ , $b$ and $c$ be the measures of angles of a triangle (in radians). It is asked to prove that $$\tan^2\left(\dfrac{\pi-a}{4}\right)+\tan^2\left(\dfrac{\pi-b}{4}\right)+\tan^2\left(\dfrac{\pi-c}{4}\right) \ge 1$$ When does equality occur ? My try : Letting $u:= \tan\left(\dfrac{\pi-a}{4}\right)$ and $v:= \tan\left(\dfrac{\pi-b}{4}\right)$ the inequality reduces to proving $$u^2+v^2+\dfrac{(1-uv)^2}{(u+v)^2} \ge 1\quad\quad (*)$$ ( $$u,v\in (0,1)$$ ) ( using $a+b+c=\pi$ and the formula for $\tan(x+y)$ and the fact that $\tan\left(\dfrac{\pi}{2}-x\right)=\dfrac{1}{\tan x}$ ) I'm having trouble in proving that last inequality. Any suggestions are welcome. Thanks. Edit : is the following reasoning to prove the inequality (*) sound ? (*) is obvious when $u^2 + v^2 \ge 1$ so we only have to deal with the case $u^2 + v^2 \le 1$ which we assume true in what follows. (*) $\iff (u^2 + v^2)(u + v)^2 \ge (u+v)^2+(1-uv)^2$ Setting $x:= u^2 + v^2$ and $a:=uv$ we get (*) $\iff x^2+(2a-1)x \ge a^2+4a-1$ Now some calculus $(x^2+(2a-1)x)' = 2x + 2a-1$ the function $\phi:x\mapsto x^2+(2a-1)x$ then has a minimum at $\dfrac 12 - a$ which is $\phi\left(\dfrac 12 - a\right) = -a^2+a-\dfrac 14$ It then suffices to have $-a^2+a-\dfrac 14 \ge a^2+4a-1$ This last ineq is equivalent to $8a^2+12a-3 \le 0$ which, in turn, is equivalent to $a \in \left[\dfrac{-6-\sqrt{60}}{8}, \dfrac{-6+\sqrt{60}}{8}\right]$ Recall that we're working under the assumption $u^2 +v^2 \le 1$ , that yields in particular that $uv \le \dfrac 12$ . since $ \dfrac{-6-\sqrt{60}}{8} \le 0 \le a := uv \le \dfrac 12 \le \dfrac{-6+\sqrt{60}}{8}$ , we're done.
