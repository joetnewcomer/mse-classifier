1,Combinatorics - How many ways are there to arrange the string of letters AAAAAABBBBBB such that each A is next to at least one other A?,Combinatorics - How many ways are there to arrange the string of letters AAAAAABBBBBB such that each A is next to at least one other A?,,"I found a problem in my counting textbook, which is stated above. It gives the string AAAAAABBBBBB, and asks for how many arrangements (using all of the letters) there are such that every A is next to at least one other A. I calculated and then looked into the back for the answer, and the answer appears to be $105$ . My answer fell short of that by quite a bit. I broke down the string into various cases, and then used Stars and Bars to find how many possibilities there are for each. Now here's what I have got so far. First case would be all As are right next to each other, leaving $2$ spots for the $6$ Bs. That gives $\binom{7}{1}$ from Stars and Bars, $7$ possibilities. Second case was dividing the As into $2$ groups of 3 As. There would have to be $1$ B between the two, which leaves $5$ Bs that can be moved. Using Stars and Bars, there are $3$ possible places to place a B and $5$ Bs in total, so $\binom{6}{2}$ , $15$ possibilities. Then there's a group of $4$ As and another group of $2$ As. $1$ B would be placed inbetween, and then the calculation would be the same as the second case, except it would have to be doubled to account that the groups of As can be swapped and it would be distinct. That gives $30$ possibilities. Then I found one final case of dividing the As into 3 groups of 2 As. 2 Bs would immediately be placed between the 3 groups, leaving 4 Bs to move between the 4 possible locations. I got $\binom{5}{3}$ for that, which adds $10$ possibilities. Summing it up, I only have $62$ possibilities, which is quite far from the $105$ answer. Any ideas where I might have miscalculated or missed a potential case? Additionally, are there any better ways to calculate this compared to this method of casework?","I found a problem in my counting textbook, which is stated above.

Then we can take a permutation of both sets and match them accordingly. This gives $${{2n} \choose n} n! n!=\frac{(2n)! n! n!}{n! n!}=(2n)!$$ possibilities. But with this we overcount, since we do not want the pairs to be ordered. Each of the $n$ pairs is counted twice, wherefore we have to divide by 2 for every pair, hence $\frac{(2n)!}{2^n}$? Well, another possiblity to do that is just to iteratively pick $2$ elements among the remaining ones, which gives ${{2n} \choose 2} {{2n-2} \choose 2} \dotsb {4 \choose 2}$ I am not sure, but I do not think that this is the same and also, I do not see the connection to double factorial.

I am trying to prove \[\sum \frac 1 {k_1\cdots k_m} = \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k^m} \binom n k\] where the sum on the left is taken over all integer $m$ -tuples $(k_1,\dots,k_m)$ such that $1\le k_1\le \cdots\le k_m\le n$ .  This comes immediately after having proved that \[ \sum_{k=1}^n b_k/k = \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{a_k}k \binom n k \] where $b_n = \sum_{k=1}^n a_k\binom n k$ .  There's a strong similarity, so I suspect that I should use this result to prove the above.  In particular it suggests that we take $a_k/k = (-1)^{k-1}/k^m$ which is to say $a_k = (-1)^{k-1}/k^{m-1}$ .  If this is the right path then we want to show that \[ \sum\frac 1 {k_1\cdots k_m} = \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{b_k}k = \sum_{k=1}^n \frac 1 k \sum_{j=1}^k a_j\binom{k}j = \sum_{k=1}^n \frac 1 k \sum_{j=1}^k \frac{(-1)^{j-1}}{j^{m-1}}\binom{k}j\] Now trying to rearrange and reindex the sums basically just seems to get you back into the proof that $\sum b_k/k = \sum a_k\binom n k /k$ so that seems like a dead end. I'm guessing that somehow, instead, we should find a more direct reason why these are equal, perhaps by splitting fractions.  For instance, $\frac 1 {2\cdot 3} = \frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{3}$ but there is no such simple splitting for $\frac 1 {2\cdot 4}$ . The right-hand side of the above seems to suggest that perhaps we fix a $1\le k \le n$ as the least number in $(k_1,\dots,k_m)$ , and then use something that looks vaguely like inclusion-exclusion. From here the question looks like ""Is there a reason why, if we collect all the terms of $\sum \frac 1 {k_1\cdots k_m}$ with a fixed $k_1$ , that the sum of these terms is $\frac 1 k \sum_{j=1}^k \frac{(-1)^{j-1}}{j^m}\binom k j$ ?"" Just to test the idea out, if we set $n=4,m=2$ and $k_1=2$ then we would be looking at the terms \[ \frac{1}{2\cdot 2}+\frac{1}{2\cdot 3}+\frac{1}{2\cdot 4} \] and on the other hand we would be trying to see whether this is the same as \[ \frac 1 2 \sum_{j=1}^2 \frac{(-1)^{j-1}}{j^2}\binom 2 j = \frac 1 2 \cdot \left( 2 - \frac 1 4  \right)\] A quick computation shows these are not equal, so then I'm not sure if I made a mistake along the way, or if the entire plan of attack is flawed.

This comes immediately after having proved that \[ \sum_{k=1}^n b_k/k = \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{a_k}k \binom n k \] where .  There's a strong similarity, so I suspect that I should use this result to prove the above.  In particular it suggests that we take which is to say .

87,Paths must cross in Lindström-Gessel-Viennot on the lattice,Paths must cross in Lindström-Gessel-Viennot on the lattice,,"The following question (which I am going to answer myself) serves to close a little gap in some combinatorial proofs that use the Lindström--Gessel--Viennot lemma. Namely, I will show a little lemma, which is mostly used tacitly. Roughly speaking, the lemma says that if $p$ and $p^{\prime}$ are two lattice paths (using north and east steps only) in $\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ such that the starting point of $p^{\prime}$ lies weakly northwest of the starting point of $p$ but the ending point of $p$ lies weakly northwest of the ending point of $p^{\prime}$, then $p$ and $p^{\prime}$ must have a point in common. (I shall state this formally in Lemma 1 below.) See also Proposition 2 for how this result gets used. The lemma may appear rather intuitive (it is similar to the fact that the game of Hex cannot end in a draw ), but the short geometric arguments would be a pain to formalize, so I will prove it combinatorially. Basic definitions and Lemma 1 The lattice shall mean the (infinite) directed graph whose vertices are all pairs of integers (that is, its vertex set is $\mathbb{Z}^{2}$), and whose arcs are \begin{align*} \left(  i,j\right)   &  \rightarrow\left(  i,j+1\right)  \qquad\text{for all }\left(  i,j\right)  \in\mathbb{Z}^2 \text{,} \qquad \text{and}\\ \left(  i,j\right)   &  \rightarrow\left(  i+1,j\right)  \qquad\text{for all }\left(  i,j\right)  \in\mathbb{Z}^2 \text{.} \end{align*} The arcs of the first kind are called north-steps , whereas the arcs of the second kind are called east-steps . The vertices of the lattice will just be called vertices . We draw the lattice as the usual integer lattice in the Cartesian plane. For each vertex $v=\left(  i,j\right)  $, we set $\operatorname*{x}\left( v\right)  =i$ and $\operatorname*{y}\left(  v\right)  =j$. We refer to $\operatorname*{x}\left(  v\right)  $ as the x-coordinate of $v$, and to $\operatorname*{y}\left(  v\right)  $ as the y-coordinate of $v$. A path will simply mean a (directed) path in the lattice. Lemma 1. Let $A$, $B$, $A^{\prime}$ and $B^{\prime}$ be four vertices such   that   \begin{align*} \operatorname*{x}\left(  A^{\prime}\right)    & \leq\operatorname*{x}\left( A\right)  ,\qquad\operatorname*{y}\left(  A^{\prime}\right)  \geq \operatorname*{y}\left(  A\right)  ,\\ \operatorname*{x}\left(  B^{\prime}\right)    & \leq\operatorname*{x}\left( B\right)  ,\qquad\operatorname*{y}\left(  B^{\prime}\right)  \geq \operatorname*{y}\left(  B\right)  . \end{align*}   Let $p$ be a path from $A$ to $B^{\prime}$. Let $p^{\prime}$ be a path from   $A^{\prime}$ to $B$. Then, $p$ and $p^{\prime}$ have a vertex in common. See Fig. 1 for an illustration of Lemma 1. Fig. 1: Lemma 1. Non-intersecting lattice paths and Proposition 2 Now, fix a nonnegative integer $k$. Let $\left[  k\right]  $ be the set $\left\{  1,2,\ldots,k\right\}  $. Let $\mathfrak{S}_{k}$ be the group of all permutations of $\left[  k\right]  $. A $k$-vertex shall mean a $k$-tuple of vertices. If $\mathbf{v} =\left(  A_{1},A_{2},\ldots,A_{k}\right)  $ is a $k$-vertex, and if $\sigma \in\mathfrak{S}_{k}$, then $\sigma\left(  \mathbf{v}\right)  $ denotes the $k$-vertex $\left(  A_{\sigma\left(  1\right)  },A_{\sigma\left(  2\right) },\ldots,A_{\sigma\left(  k\right)  }\right)  $. If $\left(  A_{1},A_{2},\ldots,A_{k}\right)  $ and $\left(  B_{1},B_{2} ,\ldots,B_{k}\right)  $ are two $k$-vertices, then a NILP from $\left(  A_{1},A_{2},\ldots,A_{k}\right)  $ to $\left(  B_{1},B_{2} ,\ldots,B_{k}\right)  $ shall mean a $k$-tuple $\left(  p_{1},p_{2} ,\ldots,p_{k}\right)  $ of paths such that each $p_{i}$ is a path from $A_{i}$ to $B_{i}$; no two of the paths $p_{1},p_{2},\ldots,p_{k}$ have a vertex in common. (""NILP"" stands for ""non-intersecting lattice paths"", but note that the paths must neither cross nor touch.) See Fig. 2 for an example of a NILP (with $k = 3$). Fig. 2: a NILP with $k = 3$. If $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ are two $k$-vertices, then $N\left( \mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}\right)  $ denotes the set of all NILPs from $\mathbf{u}$ to $\mathbf{v}$. A pair $\left(  \mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}\right)  $ of two $k$-vertices $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ is said to be nonpermutable if and only if every $\sigma\in\mathfrak{S}_{k}$ satisfying $\sigma\neq\operatorname*{id}$ satisfies $N\left(  \mathbf{u},\sigma\left(  \mathbf{v}\right)  \right) =\varnothing$. Note that we are not requiring that $N\left(  \mathbf{u} ,\mathbf{v}\right)  \neq\varnothing$ here. Proposition 2. Let $\mathbf{u}=\left(  A_{1},A_{2},\ldots,A_{k}\right)  $   and $\mathbf{v}=\left(  B_{1},B_{2},\ldots,B_{k}\right)  $ be two $k$-vertices   such that   \begin{align*} \operatorname*{x}\left(  A_{1}\right)   &  \geq\operatorname*{x}\left( A_{2}\right)  \geq\cdots\geq\operatorname*{x}\left(  A_{k}\right)  ;\\ \operatorname*{y}\left(  A_{1}\right)   &  \leq\operatorname*{y}\left( A_{2}\right)  \leq\cdots\leq\operatorname*{y}\left(  A_{k}\right)  ;\\ \operatorname*{x}\left(  B_{1}\right)   &  \geq\operatorname*{x}\left( B_{2}\right)  \geq\cdots\geq\operatorname*{x}\left(  B_{k}\right)  ;\\ \operatorname*{y}\left(  B_{1}\right)   &  \leq\operatorname*{y}\left( B_{2}\right)  \leq\cdots\leq\operatorname*{y}\left(  B_{k}\right)  . \end{align*}   Then, the pair $\left(  \mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}\right)  $ is nonpermutable. Note that the situation of Proposition 2 is illustrated on Fig. 2. What is this for? Here is why Proposition 2 is useful. Let $R$ be a commutative ring. Assume that for each arc $a$ of the lattice, some element $\omega_{a}\in R$ is given. We call this element $\omega_{a}$ the weight of $a$. If $p$ is any path, then we let $\omega\left(  p\right)  $ be the product of the weights $\omega_{a}$ over all arcs $a$ of $p$. If $\mathbf{p}=\left(  p_{1} ,p_{2},\ldots,p_{k}\right)  $ is a NILP from a $k$-vertex $\mathbf{u}$ to a $k$-vertex $\mathbf{v}$, then we define the weight $\omega\left( \mathbf{p}\right)  $ of this NILP $\mathbf{p}$ to be the product $\prod _{i=1}^{k}\omega\left(  p_{i}\right)  $. If $A$ and $B$ are two vertices, then $N\left(  A,B\right)  $ shall denote the set of all paths from $A$ to $B$. Now, recall that the lattice (as a directed graph) is acyclic. Hence, the Lindström--Gessel--Viennot lemma yields: Theorem 3. Let $\mathbf{u}=\left(  A_{1},A_{2},\ldots,A_{k}\right)  $ and   $\mathbf{v}=\left(  B_{1},B_{2},\ldots,B_{k}\right)  $ be two $k$-vertices.   Then,   \begin{align*}  \det\left(  \left(  \sum_{p\in N\left(  A_{i},B_{j}\right)  }\omega\left( p\right)  \right)  _{1\leq i\leq k,\ 1\leq j\leq k}\right)  & =\sum_{\sigma\in\mathfrak{S}_{k}}\left(  -1\right)  ^{\sigma}\sum _{\mathbf{p}\in N\left(  \mathbf{u},\sigma\left(  \mathbf{v}\right)  \right) }\omega\left(  \mathbf{p}\right)  . \end{align*}   (Here, $\left(  -1\right)  ^{\sigma}$ denotes the sign of the permutation   $\sigma$.)

For example, this is what is being done in the classical proof of the Jacobi--Trudi identities using Lindström--Gessel--Viennot .","The following question (which I am going to answer myself) serves to close a little gap in some combinatorial proofs that use the Lindström--Gessel--Viennot lemma. Namely, I will show a little lemma, which is mostly used tacitly. Roughly speaking, the lemma says that if $p$ and $p^{\prime}$ are two lattice paths (using north and east steps only) in $\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ such that the starting point of $p^{\prime}$ lies weakly northwest of the starting point of $p$ but the ending point of $p$ lies weakly northwest of the ending point of $p^{\prime}$, then $p$ and $p^{\prime}$ must have a point in common. (I shall state this formally in Lemma 1 below.) See also Proposition 2 for how this result gets used. The lemma may appear rather intuitive (it is similar to the fact that the game of Hex cannot end in a draw ), but the short geometric arguments would be a pain to formalize, so I will prove it combinatorially. Basic definitions and Lemma 1 The lattice shall mean the (infinite) directed graph whose vertices are all pairs of integers (that is, its vertex set is $\mathbb{Z}^{2}$), and whose arcs are \begin{align*} \left(  i,j\right)   &  \rightarrow\left(  i,j+1\right)  \qquad\text{for all }\left(  i,j\right)  \in\mathbb{Z}^2 \text{,} \qquad \text{and}\\ \left(  i,j\right)   &  \rightarrow\left(  i+1,j\right)  \qquad\text{for all }\left(  i,j\right)  \in\mathbb{Z}^2 \text{.} \end{align*} The arcs of the first kind are called north-steps , whereas the arcs of the second kind are called east-steps . The vertices of the lattice will just be called vertices . We draw the lattice as the usual integer lattice in the Cartesian plane. For each vertex $v=\left(  i,j\right)  $, we set $\operatorname*{x}\left( v\right)  =i$ and $\operatorname*{y}\left(  v\right)  =j$. We refer to $\operatorname*{x}\left(  v\right)  $ as the x-coordinate of $v$, and to $\operatorname*{y}\left(  v\right)  $ as the y-coordinate of $v$. A path will simply mean a (directed) path in the lattice. Lemma 1. Let $A$, $B$, $A^{\prime}$ and $B^{\prime}$ be four vertices such   that   \begin{align*} \operatorname*{x}\left(  A^{\prime}\right)    & \leq\operatorname*{x}\left( A\right)  ,\qquad\operatorname*{y}\left(  A^{\prime}\right)  \geq \operatorname*{y}\left(  A\right)  ,\\ \operatorname*{x}\left(  B^{\prime}\right)    & \leq\operatorname*{x}\left( B\right)  ,\qquad\operatorname*{y}\left(  B^{\prime}\right)  \geq \operatorname*{y}\left(  B\right)  . \end{align*}   Let $p$ be a path from $A$ to $B^{\prime}$. Let $p^{\prime}$ be a path from   $A^{\prime}$ to $B$. Then, $p$ and $p^{\prime}$ have a vertex in common. See Fig. 1 for an illustration of Lemma 1. Fig. 1: Lemma 1. Non-intersecting lattice paths and Proposition 2 Now, fix a nonnegative integer $k$. Let $\left[  k\right]  $ be the set $\left\{  1,2,\ldots,k\right\}  $. Let $\mathfrak{S}_{k}$ be the group of all permutations of $\left[  k\right]  $. A $k$-vertex shall mean a $k$-tuple of vertices. If $\mathbf{v} =\left(  A_{1},A_{2},\ldots,A_{k}\right)  $ is a $k$-vertex, and if $\sigma \in\mathfrak{S}_{k}$, then $\sigma\left(  \mathbf{v}\right)  $ denotes the $k$-vertex $\left(  A_{\sigma\left(  1\right)  },A_{\sigma\left(  2\right) },\ldots,A_{\sigma\left(  k\right)  }\right)  $. If $\left(  A_{1},A_{2},\ldots,A_{k}\right)  $ and $\left(  B_{1},B_{2} ,\ldots,B_{k}\right)  $ are two $k$-vertices, then a NILP from $\left(  A_{1},A_{2},\ldots,A_{k}\right)  $ to $\left(  B_{1},B_{2} ,\ldots,B_{k}\right)  $ shall mean a $k$-tuple $\left(  p_{1},p_{2} ,\ldots,p_{k}\right)  $ of paths such that each $p_{i}$ is a path from $A_{i}$ to $B_{i}$; no two of the paths $p_{1},p_{2},\ldots,p_{k}$ have a vertex in common. (""NILP"" stands for ""non-intersecting lattice paths"", but note that the paths must neither cross nor touch.) See Fig. 2 for an example of a NILP (with $k = 3$). Fig. 2: a NILP with $k = 3$. If $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ are two $k$-vertices, then $N\left( \mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}\right)  $ denotes the set of all NILPs from $\mathbf{u}$ to $\mathbf{v}$. A pair $\left(  \mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}\right)  $ of two $k$-vertices $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ is said to be nonpermutable if and only if every $\sigma\in\mathfrak{S}_{k}$ satisfying $\sigma\neq\operatorname*{id}$ satisfies $N\left(  \mathbf{u},\sigma\left(  \mathbf{v}\right)  \right) =\varnothing$. Note that we are not requiring that $N\left(  \mathbf{u} ,\mathbf{v}\right)  \neq\varnothing$ here. Proposition 2. Let $\mathbf{u}=\left(  A_{1},A_{2},\ldots,A_{k}\right)  $   and $\mathbf{v}=\left(  B_{1},B_{2},\ldots,B_{k}\right)  $ be two $k$-vertices   such that   \begin{align*} \operatorname*{x}\left(  A_{1}\right)   &  \geq\operatorname*{x}\left( A_{2}\right)  \geq\cdots\geq\operatorname*{x}\left(  A_{k}\right)  ;\\ \operatorname*{y}\left(  A_{1}\right)   &  \leq\operatorname*{y}\left( A_{2}\right)  \leq\cdots\leq\operatorname*{y}\left(  A_{k}\right)  ;\\ \operatorname*{x}\left(  B_{1}\right)   &  \geq\operatorname*{x}\left( B_{2}\right)  \geq\cdots\geq\operatorname*{x}\left(  B_{k}\right)  ;\\ \operatorname*{y}\left(  B_{1}\right)   &  \leq\operatorname*{y}\left( B_{2}\right)  \leq\cdots\leq\operatorname*{y}\left(  B_{k}\right)  . \end{align*}   Then, the pair $\left(  \mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}\right)  $ is nonpermutable. Note that the situation of Proposition 2 is illustrated on Fig. 2. What is this for? Here is why Proposition 2 is useful. Let $R$ be a commutative ring. Assume that for each arc $a$ of the lattice, some element $\omega_{a}\in R$ is given. We call this element $\omega_{a}$ the weight of $a$. If $p$ is any path, then we let $\omega\left(  p\right)  $ be the product of the weights $\omega_{a}$ over all arcs $a$ of $p$. If $\mathbf{p}=\left(  p_{1} ,p_{2},\ldots,p_{k}\right)  $ is a NILP from a $k$-vertex $\mathbf{u}$ to a $k$-vertex $\mathbf{v}$, then we define the weight $\omega\left( \mathbf{p}\right)  $ of this NILP $\mathbf{p}$ to be the product $\prod _{i=1}^{k}\omega\left(  p_{i}\right)  $. If $A$ and $B$ are two vertices, then $N\left(  A,B\right)  $ shall denote the set of all paths from $A$ to $B$. Now, recall that the lattice (as a directed graph) is acyclic. Hence, the Lindström--Gessel--Viennot lemma yields: Theorem 3. Let $\mathbf{u}=\left(  A_{1},A_{2},\ldots,A_{k}\right)  $ and   $\mathbf{v}=\left(  B_{1},B_{2},\ldots,B_{k}\right)  $ be two $k$-vertices.   Then,   \begin{align*}  \det\left(  \left(  \sum_{p\in N\left(  A_{i},B_{j}\right)  }\omega\left( p\right)  \right)  _{1\leq i\leq k,\ 1\leq j\leq k}\right)  & =\sum_{\sigma\in\mathfrak{S}_{k}}\left(  -1\right)  ^{\sigma}\sum _{\mathbf{p}\in N\left(  \mathbf{u},\sigma\left(  \mathbf{v}\right)  \right) }\omega\left(  \mathbf{p}\right)  . \end{align*}   (Here, $\left(  -1\right)  ^{\sigma}$ denotes the sign of the permutation   $\sigma$.) If a pair $\left(  \mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}\right)  $ of two $k$-vertices is nonpermutable, then the sum on the right hand side of Theorem 3 can be simplified, as only one of its terms (if any) is nonzero. This, and Proposition 2, leads to the following fact: Corollary 4.

88,100 Prison Problem- Why does this solution not work?,100 Prison Problem- Why does this solution not work?,,"There is a combinatoric riddle which goes as follows: In this problem, 100 numbered prisoners must find their own numbers in one of 100 drawers in order to survive. The rules state that each prisoner may open only 50 drawers and cannot communicate with other prisoners. The best solution found thus far is one where: 1. Each prisoner first opens the drawer with his own number. 2. If this drawer contains his number he is done and was successful. 3. Otherwise, the drawer contains the number of another prisoner and he next opens the drawer with this number. 4. The prisoner repeats steps 2 and 3 until he finds his own number or has opened 50 drawers. Through this process, as long as a cycle of more than 50 does not exist, there is a fairly high (roughly 30%) chance that the prisoners succeed. This is because there is a roughly 70% chance  that a cycle of 51 or more exists. When trying to calculate the probability of there being a cycle of 51 or larger, I had a prisoner start at his own drawer. The probability that the drawer didn't contain his number should be 99/100. In such a case, he goes to the second drawer (whose number was found in the first drawer). The probability that this drawer doesn't contain his number is 98/99. Thus the probability of him going through 51 or more drawers before finding his own number, I assume, should be 99/100 * 98/99 * 97/98 *...*49/50. Hence, the probability of there being a cycle of size 51 or more by this chain of reasoning would be 49/100. I was hoping to ask if someone here could let me know the flaw in my line of reasoning.

A tightness of 228 comes from {{114,0,0,0,1}, {-114,0,0,0,1}, {0,114,0,0,2}, {0,-114,0,0,2}, {0,0,114,0,3}, {0,0,-114,0,3}, {0,0,0,114,0}, {0,0,0,-114,0}, {31,31,31,31,99}, {-31,-31,-31,-31,99}, {55,55,-55,-55,-30}, {-55,-55,55,55,-30}} In 6D, the largest known acute set has 16 points. In 7D, the largest known acute set has 24 points. In 8D, the largest known acute set has 32 points. In 9D, the largest known acute set has 48 points. In 10D, the largest known acute set has 72 points. What are the tightest presentations for maximal acute sets?  Do I even have it right for 3D and 4D?","If the five 3D coordinates 003 044 330 404 443 are plotted, all the angles happen to be acute, so this is an acute set .  It is believed that five points is the largest acute set in 3 dimensions.  Also, all the points are on the integer grid, and the largest-smallest grid values is 4-0 or 4, so this acute set has a tightness of 4.

98,In how many ways can seven people depart a lift on three floors if at least one person leaves the lift on each floor?,In how many ways can seven people depart a lift on three floors if at least one person leaves the lift on each floor?,,"Seven people enter a lift. The lift stops at three unspecified floors. At each of the three floors , no one enters the lift but at least one person leaves the lift . After the three floor stops , the lift is empty. In how many can this happen. What I tried was I created an equation of three variables x,y, z and equated them to 7 .I found the total  no. of solution by using formula (n+r-1)C(r-1) and subtracted the case of occurrence of any x,y,z as zero and subtracted those possibilities from the total solution but I was not able to get the result. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks for advance.","Seven people enter a lift. The lift stops at three unspecified floors.

99,Winning strategy in game of cutting rectangle,Winning strategy in game of cutting rectangle,,"There is a bar of chocolate of size $N$ x $M$. Little square $(x, y)$ is poisoned. There are 2 players taking turns. In each move they can cut the bar along any of the horizontal or vertical lines, then the part which does not contain $(x, y)$ is being eaten. The player who is left only with square $(x, y)$ loses (beacause it is poisoned). Which player has the winning strategy? I guess that this game is equivalent to game of Nim due to Sprauge-Grundy theorem, but I don't know how.","There is a bar of chocolate of size $N$ x $M$. Little square $(x, y)$ is poisoned.
