1,Proving closure of set,Proving closure of set,,"My attempt: $\overline{B} \subseteq \ell^\infty$ follows from the fact that $B \subseteq \ell^\infty$ and $\ell^\infty$ is closed. For $\ell^\infty \subseteq  \overline{B}$ , we must show every sequence in $\ell^\infty$ can be represented as a limit point of a sequence in $B$ . Thus, consider $x = (x_1, x_2, ...) \in \ell^\infty$ . If $x$ has a constant subsequence, we are done, so consider when $x$ does not. Let $d_i = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_i, \sup\{x_{i+1}, x_{i+2}, ...\}, \sup\{x_{i+1}, x_{i+2}, ...\}, ...\}$ . Thus, $d_i$ is an element of $B$ as it has a constant subsequence. Now, consider the case where $x$ does not reach its supremum on any of its elements. Thus, $x$ must have an infinitely increasing or decreasing tail whose elements converge to the supremum. Thus, by nature of the supremum, we can find a $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that when $n > N$ , $||x - d_n|| < \epsilon$ . Thus, we need only consider when $x$ has no infinitely decreasing/increasing tails, so reaches its supremum on all tails. Formally, $||x||_\infty$ is reached by some $x_i$ on each tail of $x$ . Thus, since $x$ has no constant subsequence, $||x||_\infty$ can only be repeated a finite number of times in the sequence. Thus, we can form a decreasing chain of maximum elements in $||x||_\infty$ . Thus, $||x - d_i||$ form an eventually decreasing sequence as $i \rightarrow \infty$ . However, at this point I am having trouble proving that $||x - d_i||$ becomes $\epsilon-$ close to each other and can only really state that they form a decreasing chain. For the second question, i.e. showing what $int(B)$ is, I believe $int(B) = \emptyset$ . Suppose for a contradiction $B_r(x) \subseteq B$ for some $x \in B, r > 0$ . However, consider the sequence $y$ which replaces each constant subsequence $x_{n_k}$ of $x$ with the subsequence $x_{n_k} + r/2^k$ and is the same otherwise. Thus, $||x - y|| = r/2$ so $y \in B_r(x)$ but $y \not \in B$ , so this open ball cannot be contained in $B$ . Contradiction. At this point, I would really appreciate any feedback on whether or not I am on the right track for both of these proofs (and if the latter looks complete or not).

5,Confused about arrangements on a word,Confused about arrangements on a word,,"I'm trying to do this problem from ""The Probability Tutoring Book"" by Carol Ash. If the letters in ILLINOIS are arranged at random, find the probability that the permutation begins or ends with L. My attempt: We'll first find the total number of permutations. Total Permutations: $\frac {8!}{(2!)(3!)}$ My reasoning for that total is we can arrange the eight letters in ILLINOIS $8!$ times. Since there are two L's and three I's, any arrangement where we just swap the I's with each other or the L's with each other, we have the same string(i.e. I $L_1L_2$ INOIS is the same as I $L_2L_1$ INOIS.) Now I'll go about using the inclusion and exclusion principle to find the probability that our string begins with L or ends with L. Total strings that begin with L: $\frac {7!}{(2!)(3!)}$ Where I use the same reasoning as above, but this time I fix the first letter to be ""L"" and can permute the other letters $7!$ ways I use the same reasoning for the total strings that end with L : $\frac {7!}{(2!)(3!)}$ Now I take care of double counting, the total number of strings with both L as the first and last letter is $\frac {6!}{(2!)(3!)}$ . Again, I applied the same reasoning as above. Putting everything together, $$P(\text {begins or ends with L}) = \left(\frac {1}{\frac {8!}{(2!)(3!)}}\right) \times\left(\frac {7!}{(2!)(3!)} + \frac {7!}{(2!)(3!)} - \frac {6!}{(2!)(3!)}\right) = \frac {13}{56}$$ However, according to the answers, the correct answer is $\frac {26}{56}$ , so I'm off by a factor or 2. A possible reasoning could be that I $L_1L_2$ INOIS is NOT the same as I $L_2L_1$ INOIS. Why would this be? Attempting this again on my differently, $P(\text{first letter is L}) = P(\text{last letter is L}) = \frac {2}{8}$ since there are 2 L's of 8 letters $P(\text{first letter is L} \cap \text {last  letter is L}) = \frac{2}{8}\frac{1}{7}$ since there are 2 L's for the first letter and then they'll be 1 L for the last letter. Putting everything together: $P(\text{first letter is L} \cup \text{last  letter is L}) = \frac{2}{8} + \frac {2}{8} -  \frac{2}{8}\frac{1}{7} = \frac {26}{56}$ which concurs with the answer in the book.

Ideally, I'd like an answer in some closed form. Here are my thoughts so far: after taking a ""brute force"" approach via binomial expansion, I have found that $$ (x-1)^k(x+1)^{d-k} = \sum_{p=0}^d \left[\sum_{j=0}^{d-k} (-1)^{k+j-p}  \binom{k}{p-j} \binom{d-k}{j} \right]x^p, $$ which I wasn't able to simplify further.  So, our coefficient should be equal to $\sum_{j=0}^{d-k} (-1)^{k+j-p}  \binom{k}{p-j} \binom{d-k}{j}$ . Another thought is to compute the coefficient as $\frac 1{p!} f_{k,d}^{(p)}(0)$ , where $f_{k,d}(x) = (x-1)^k(x+1)^{d-k}$ .  Taking derivatives leads to the interesting recurrence $$ f_{k,d}' = kf_{k-1,d-1} + (d-k)f_{k,d-1}. $$ So in other words, if $c^p_{k,d}$ denotes the desired coefficient, then we have $$ c_{k,d}^p = \frac 1{p!}f^{(p)}_{k,d}(0) =  \frac{k}{p!}f_{k-1,d-1}^{(p-1)} + \frac{d-k}{p!}f_{k,d}^{(p-1)}\\ =\frac{k}{p}c_{k-1,d-1}^{p-1} + \frac{d-k}{p}c_{k,d-1}^{p-1}. $$ I wasn't able to see a clear path forward from there.

Also, why is $p$ or not $p$ an argument without premises? Isn't $p$ itself a premise?
