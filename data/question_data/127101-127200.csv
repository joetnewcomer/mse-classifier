Here's what I have so far: Let $G$ be a group of order 225. By Sylow's theorems, we have that $G$ contains $P_{25}$ and $P_{9}$, subgroups of order $25$ and $9$, respectively. It's easy to see that $n_5 = 1$ and, so, $P_{25}$ is normal in $G$. Therefore, $G = P_{25}P_9$, since $P_{25} \cap P_9 = \{1\}$. Therefore, $G \simeq P_{25} \rtimes_{\varphi} P_9$ for some $\varphi: P_9 \rightarrow \text{Aut}(P_{25})$. Since $P_{25}$ and $P_9$ are both abelian, we need $\varphi$ to be non-trivial. Now, $P_{25}$ cannot be cyclic (because that would make $G$ abelian), and so, $P_{25} = \mathbb{Z}/5\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/5\mathbb{Z}$. We know that $\text{Aut}(\mathbb{Z}/5\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/5\mathbb{Z}) = GL(2,5)$ which has order $480$, and so, $|\varphi(P_9)| = 1$ or $3$ and, since we need $\varphi$ non trivial, we have $|\varphi(P_9)| = 3$. Now, we have two choices (upto isomorphism) for $P_9$, $\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}/9\mathbb{Z}$. I figure finding such a $\varphi$ for each of these choices will give me what I need. However, I get stuck here. I tried to find an element of order $3$ in $GL(2,5)$ (for the case where $P_9$ is the cyclic group), but I'm not sure how to do this easily. I'm not really sure how to proceed when $P_9 = \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$ either.","I need to find 2 nonabelian, nonisomorphic groups of order 225.

2,The order of elements in groups of a particular structure,The order of elements in groups of a particular structure,,"$\textbf{Assumptions:}$ Let $G$ be finite abelian group and $A = \{a_i\}_{i=1}^m \subseteq G.$ Suppose that every $g \in G$ can be formed uniquely using elements of $A$ as follows: $$g = \lambda_1 a_1 + \ldots + \lambda_m a_m, \ \ \sum_{i=1}^m \lambda_i \leq s \text{ and } \lambda_i \in \mathbb{N}.$$ Here we treat $G$ as a $\mathbb{Z}$-module. Essentially we select at most $s$ many elements of $A$ to combine together to form $g$. Furthermore, suppose that there exists a natural number $k$ such the order$(a_i) = k$ for all $i \in \{1, \ldots, m\}.$ Immediately, we know that for any $g \in G$ that $kg = 0$ as we can simply distribute. Additionally, that gives us that $\text{order}(g) \mid k.$ $\textbf{Question:}$ Is it possible to $\textbf{claim}$ that $$\text{order}(g) = \frac{k}{\gcd(\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_m, k)}?$$ $\textbf{Reasoning:}$ Since $\gcd(\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_m, k)$ will divide every $\lambda_i$, we simply get that every coefficient for each $a_i$ in the sum $$\left( \frac{k}{\gcd(\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_m, k)} \right) g = \sum_{i=1}^m \frac{\lambda_i}{\gcd(\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_m, k)} k a_i$$ is a multiple of $k$. Hence, $$\left( \frac{k}{\gcd(\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_m, k)} \right) g = 0$$ as $ka_i = 0$ for every $i.$ That shows that $$\text{order}(g) \leq \frac{k}{\gcd(\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_m, k)}.$$ I feel like the uniqueness of how we write the elements of $G$ in terms of $A$ should restrict a smaller order than the claim.

4,Is there a way to get all the permutation braids of a braid group?,Is there a way to get all the permutation braids of a braid group?,,"Geometrically, it's easy to ""draw"" the permutation braids, but I was wondering if there was an algorithm to write down all the permutation braids in terms of the Artin generators. I had a few ideas, but none of them seem quite feasible or efficient. First, I considered the fundamental braid $\Delta_n \in B_n$ and I thought permutation braids must be formed from the fundamental braid by removing some Artin generators. So by going through all choices and checking whether they are permutation braids, we can get the set of permutation braids. Second, because $B_{n-1}$ embeds into $B_n$, the permutation braids of $B_n$ are the permutation braids of $B_{n-1}$ and the permutation braids containing the last generator $\sigma_{n-1}.$ So if we have the set of permutation braids of $B_{n-1},$ we can try to insert one or more $\sigma_{n-1}$ to get the other permutation braids of $B_n$. Thirdly, I know there is a bijection between the permutation braids of $B_n$ and the symmetric group $S_n$. But it's difficult to explicitly write the permutation braid in terms of the generators. One method I thought of is: if we number the braids $1$ through $n$ and we have a permutation $\rho$, then first send the $n$th braid to position $\rho(n)$ which can be done by $\sigma_{n-1}\sigma_{n-2}\cdots \sigma_{\rho(n)}$ and etc. However, this method doesn't work always because if we have $\sigma_1\sigma_2 \in B_3$ corresponding to the permutation $(1 2 3),$ we can't write that as a permutation braid starting with $\sigma_2.$ These are the ideas that I had, but the first two seem much too inefficient while the third one doesn't seem to even work. Since permutation braids seem crucial to the theory of braid cryptography, I was thinking there must be some efficient method to write them out, but I couldn't find them in literature.

13,Understanding torsors and semidirect products of groups,Understanding torsors and semidirect products of groups,,"I'm trying to understand the semi-direct product of groups from either a categorical or a geometric perspective and failing miserably. The four things I'm hoping will fit into a coherent picture are: Semidirect product as left adjoint ; Semidirect product in terms of torsors ; Semidirect product as a homotopy quotient ; Semidirect product in terms of subobjects of the product. I'll try to explain my struggles with each point. I started by trying to find a universal property and stumbled upon the first description, but I feel it did not help me even understand why semidirect products are interesting. Let $\mathsf{Grp^2}$ be the arrow category of the category of groups, and let $\mathsf{Grp}\circlearrowleft$ be the category of groups acting on groups: an object is a group action of a group $G$ on a group $H$ that respects all the operations, an arrow is an equivariant one. Such actions are in bijection with group homomorphisms $G\to \mathsf{Aut}(H)$. If these hold, we'll say $H$ is a $G$-group. The right adjoint is the forgetful functor $\mathsf{Grp^2}\to \mathsf{Grp}\circlearrowleft$ taking a group homomorphism to action by conjugation. The left adjoint, if I understand correctly, takes a $G$-group $\alpha:G\times H\to H$ to the inclusion $G\to H\rtimes G$. But why even care about $G$-groups? What is the semidirect product actually doing? Seeking intuition I hoped torsors might be related. Now, I don't know anything about torsors from the algebraic-geometry standpoint - for me a $G$-torsor is just a uniquely transitive $G$-set. John Baez's Torsors Made Easy and the linked answer made it clear torsors are somehow related to semidirect products, but I still don't get how, and still don't have a geometric picture of the semidirect product. What I understand of the answer is as follows: We start with an $H$-group $G$, and a $G$-torsor $S$. As a $G$-set, $S$ has $G$ as a group of autobijections. If we pick a unit in $S$ then we have a group isomorphism $G\cong S$ which makes $S$ into an $H$-group. This gives the set $S$ another group $H$ of autobijections. The semidirect product $G\rtimes H$ is the subgroup of $\mathsf{Sym}(S)$ generated by the subgroups $G,H\leq \mathsf{Sym}(S)$. But what is the geometry of this story? As the question itself mentions, the group $H$ seems to be keeping track of ""orientation"", while $G$ is doing the ""movement"". Does the semidirect product reflect the geometry of a torsor? I just don't get it. In Tao's Compactness and Contradiction I found a very useful page or two about torsors, with a brief discussion of the lamplighter group. The idea was to think of an element of $G$ as a ratio $\frac BA$ between elements in some convenient $G$-torsor of ""states"". This makes conjugation intuitive since $g\frac BA g^{-1}=\frac{gA}{gB}$ is the unique group element with initial state $gA$ and terminal state $gB$. I was very hopeful this intuitive approach might actually motivate the unpleasant multiplication of the semidirect product, but I haven't been able to make sense of that myself. Waiting until 1,2 make sense; Waiting until 1,2 make sense.","I'm trying to understand the semi-direct product of groups from either a categorical or a geometric perspective and failing miserably. The four things I'm hoping will fit into a coherent picture are: Semidirect product as left adjoint ; Semidirect product in terms of torsors ; Semidirect product as a homotopy quotient ; Semidirect product in terms of subobjects of the product. I'll try to explain my struggles with each point. I started by trying to find a universal property and stumbled upon the first description, but I feel it did not help me even understand why semidirect products are interesting. Let $\mathsf{Grp^2}$ be the arrow category of the category of groups, and let $\mathsf{Grp}\circlearrowleft$ be the category of groups acting on groups: an object is a group action of a group $G$ on a group $H$ that respects all the operations, an arrow is an equivariant one. Such actions are in bijection with group homomorphisms $G\to \mathsf{Aut}(H)$. If these hold, we'll say $H$ is a $G$-group. The right adjoint is the forgetful functor $\mathsf{Grp^2}\to \mathsf{Grp}\circlearrowleft$ taking a group homomorphism to action by conjugation. The left adjoint, if I understand correctly, takes a $G$-group $\alpha:G\times H\to H$ to the inclusion $G\to H\rtimes G$. But why even care about $G$-groups? What is the semidirect product actually doing? Seeking intuition I hoped torsors might be related. Now, I don't know anything about torsors from the algebraic-geometry standpoint - for me a $G$-torsor is just a uniquely transitive $G$-set.

Show that $G$ is an elementary Abelian $p$-group for some prime number $p$.

Let me first tell you what I have investigated so far: 1 - Tensor product It is known that ($n>m$) $$(n,0)\otimes (0,m) \simeq (n,m) \oplus (n-1,m-1) \oplus \ldots \oplus (n-m,0)$$ where $(n,m)$ refers to the carrier space of the irreducible representation with highest weight $(n,m)$ (as usual). The matrices acting on the left hand side are easily constructed via the Kroneckerproduct. The question is now, how can one extract the $(n,m)$ space from it. The only way I see is to get to know the above isomorphism explicitely (which would be the analog of knowing the Clebsch-Gordon coefficients in the $su(2)$ case) and this problem seems to be much more difficult to solve than my original one. 2 - Using $\mathfrak{su}(2)$-strings Assuming one knows the connection of all weight vectors to the su(2)-strings one could calculate its ladder operators (the describing equations would result in a linear system in the matrix coefficients) and from it one could reconstruct the 8 su(3) matrix-reps. The problem is finding these connections: I first thought I could reconstruct the su(2) strings with the same algorithm one finds all weights from the Cartan Matrix. But I run into trouble if weight vectors with multiplicites $>1$ are appearing. Even if I'd know the multiplicities I couldn't find a rule for: which string belongs to which weight vector. 3 - Using the commutation relations I even tried to solve $$[T_i,T_j]=i \sum_{k=1}^{8} c_{ijk}T_k $$ directly. As Ansatz for the matrices I take general hermitian tracefree $n\times n$ matrices (which results in $n^2-1$ parameters). The first problem is that this is a quadratic equation in the matrix coefficients and Mathematica seems to be terrible slow in solving such a system exactly. Furthermore the $n^2-1$ parameters allow additional freedom (for example choosing some matrices to be real) and it seems not practical for automation since one would have to fix the remaining parameters for each case separatly.

95,"Is $H^2$ weakly closed in $H$? Isaacs Finite Group Theory, exercise 8B.6","Is  weakly closed in ? Isaacs Finite Group Theory, exercise 8B.6",H^2 H,"I'm trying to solve exercise 8B.6 on page 249 of Isaacs's Finite Group Theory textbook (the second question in a series; this is the third as question here ).  I have an idea, but it doesn't quite work.  It seems like the precursor to the idea in the next exercise, so I'd really like for it to work. Can my idea be fixed? The exercise asks: If $G$ is a finite primitive permutation group with a point stabilizer $H$ that has an orbit of size 2, then $G$ is dihedral of order twice an odd prime in its natural action. The previous exercise had the stabilizer's orbit size reduced to 1, and it followed by showing a maximal subgroup contained in two point stabilizers had to be the identity (which caused a huge collapse: $G$ is then cyclic of prime order).  Ok, so I want to do the same thing, $H$ has a big subgroup contained in two stabilizers, so that big subgroup is the identity (which finishes the whole thing for my choice of subgroup). Here was the smaller question I had while doing that, but I answered it depressingly as: ""No."" Suppose $H$ is a maximal subgroup of the finite group $G$, and let $K = H^2 = E^2(H)$ be the subgroup of $H$ generated by the squares of the elements in $H$.  If $g\in G$ takes $K$ to $K^g ≤ H$, then must $g$ normalize $K$? Well, taking $G$ to be $\operatorname{PGL}(2,q)$ for $q ≡ ±3\bmod 8$, and $H$ to be a Sylow 2-subgroup (so a dihedral group of order 8 with partial fusion), then $K$ is the order 2 normal subgroup of $H$ and is not weakly closed: there is a $g\in G$ that takes $K$ to a non-normal subgroup of order 2 in $H$.  When $q = 3$, $H$ is a maximal subgroup of $G ≅ S_4$. Now the action of $G$ on the cosets of $P$ is primitive, but not faithful, so this isn't actually a counterexample, but wow it seems close. Is it true that $K$ is weakly closed in $H$ (with respect to $G$) if $H$ is core-free (with respect to $G$)? The only reason $H$ had a core was because $q$ was chosen so small.  But all $q$ have the same basic setup as far as the relationship of $K$ in $H$ and conjugation in $G$, it is just that $H$ is no longer maximal for larger $q$.","I'm trying to solve exercise 8B.6 on page 249 of Isaacs's Finite Group Theory textbook (the second question in a series; this is the third as question here ).

First, call the boundary component in $M'$ we're focusing on $T$.

I fill in the rest (a 3-ball) in an essentially unique way.  After I've done all the attaching I want, I get a Seifert-fibred space $M$. My question is: how can I get a presentation for $\pi_1(M)$ from the knowledge of $S$ and the slopes?  For example, if $S$ is a disk, then $M'$ is just a solid torus.  Attaching another solid torus with slope $\frac{p}{q}$ gives the lens space $L_\frac{p}{q}$. If $t$ represents a longitudinal circle in $M'$, then $\pi_1(M')=\langle t\rangle$ and for $M$ we simply add the relation $t^q=1$. But things can't be that easy!
