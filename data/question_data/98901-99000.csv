Is there a known proof that $$\overline{G}_{s}(x)=\frac{1}{\Gamma\left(s+1\right)}\lim_{\delta \to 0}\left(\int_{0}^{x-\delta}+ \int_{x+\delta}^{\infty}\right)\frac{t^{s}}{e^{t-x} -1}\mathrm{d}t = \Re \mathrm{Li}_{s+1}(e^x),\quad s>0, x>0  $$ I searched the internet without success for a relevant link, but perhaps there is a general result from complex analysis. Edit: Thanks to R.J. Mathar's links I have the following argument: Ng cites Dingle and gives the relation to the Fermi-Dirac functions (see https://dlmf.nist.gov/25.12.E14 ) $G_s(x)=-\Re F_s(x+i\pi).$  If we use the integrals in a heuristic way this gives for $x>0$ $$G_s(x) = -\Re F_s(x+i\pi) \stackrel{?}{=}  -\Re \left(\frac{1}{\Gamma\left(s+1\right)}\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{t^{s}}{e^{t-x-i\pi}+1}\mathrm{d}t\right) =  -\Re \left(\frac{1}{\Gamma\left(s+1\right)}\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{t^{s}}{1-e^{t-x}}\mathrm{d}t\right)=\Re \mathrm{Li}_{s+1}(e^x)$$ Is the second step justified? From the DLMF notation, I would think that the argument of $F_s(x)$ should be real in the integral form, otherwise they use $z$ for complex variables?!",,"['complex-analysis', 'special-functions', 'polylogarithm', 'cauchy-principal-value']"

I think this has a simple pole at $z=a^{-1}$ and two essential essential singularities at $z=0$ and $z=\infty$. I find the residue for the simple pole to be \begin{align*} \text{Res}\left(f(z),z=a^{-1}\right) = -\frac{1}{a} e^{-\frac{i t}{2}\left(a+a^{-1}\right)} \end{align*} For the essential singularity at $z=0$, I use the Laurent series \begin{align*} e^{-\frac{i t}{2}\left(z+z^{-1}\right)} = \sum\limits_{n\in\mathbb{Z}} z^n I_{n}(-it) = \sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} \left(z^n +\frac{1}{z^n}\right) I_{n}(-it) - I_{0}(-it) \end{align*} Where in the second equality I used $I_{-n}(t)=I_{n}(t)$ and subtracted the double counting.

The second way is let $$  \limsup_{n\to\infty} \sqrt[n]{|a_{n}|}=\ell=\frac{1}{R}$$ And $$\frac{1}{\liminf\limits_{n\to\infty} \sqrt[n]{|a_{n}|}}=\frac{1}{\ell'}$$ So $\ell' \leq \ell $ and $\frac{1}{\ell'}=\ell$ if $\ell'<\ell<1 \ $then $\frac{1}{\ell'}>1>\ell$contradiction similarly for the other cases . The counter example is: $a_{n}= 2^n  $ if $n$ is even and $\frac{1}{2^n} $ if $n$ is odd. Note : this is not my idea .",,['complex-analysis']

If so, I could program each of the expressions as anonymous functions and save a bunch of time exploring the complex domain for $\beta$. Unfortunately, my subpar math skills have left me scratching my head on how to proceed. I've looked at a bunch of different examples/tricks on determining the roots for 4th degree polynomials, but they all seem to apply to real polynomials with real coefficients. In the polynomial I've expressed above, $\beta$ can be complex. So again, my question is, can I solve for each of the roots in the form of an analytic expression as a function of $\beta$ and if so, how do I proceed given the complex nature of the polynomial?",,"['complex-analysis', 'polynomials', 'complex-numbers', 'roots']"

98,A Formulation of The Riemann Hypothesis,A Formulation of The Riemann Hypothesis,,"To preface this inquiry, I am aware of the fastidious nature of the mathematics presented on this exchange. In addition to that, I apologize for my ineptness and the contention in this particular subject; however, this is of great interest to me. I ask for pardon with the great length of this text. The following formulation invokes the Argument Principle due to Cauchy. In this sense, consider the closed rectifiable Jordan curve $\mathcal D^{+}= \mathcal D^{+}(T)$ with vertices $(\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon)-iT, 2-iT, 2+iT, (\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon)+iT$, traversed in that order, i.e., with positive orientation. Likewise, let $D^{-}=D^{-}(T)$ denote the closed contour with vertices $-1-iT, (\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon)-iT, (\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon)+iT, -1+iT$, and positive orientation. In both cases $\epsilon$ is chosen to be arbitrarily small. Furthermore, invoking the detail that the zeros of the function $\xi(s)$, where $s=\sigma+it$, are identical to the non-trivial zeros of the function $\zeta(s)$, and the fact that $\xi(s)$ has no poles; we obtain the number of zeros of $\zeta$ in the region $\mathcal D^{+}$ and $\mathcal D^{-}$ are $$N_+(T)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\mathcal D^+} \frac{{\xi}^\prime (s)}{\xi(s)}ds=\frac{1}{2 \pi}Im\left(\int_{\mathcal D^+} \frac{{\xi}^\prime (s)}{\xi(s)}ds\right)$$ and $$N_-(T)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\mathcal D^-} \frac{{\xi}^\prime (s)}{\xi(s)}ds=\frac{1}{2 \pi}Im\left(\int_{\mathcal D^-} \frac{{\xi}^\prime (s)}{\xi(s)}ds\right),$$ respectively. By the symmetry of both $\xi$ and $\mathcal D^{+}, \mathcal D^{-}$, $N_-(T)=N_+(T)$. Let $\mathcal C_0^{+}$ denote the contour with vertices $\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon, 2, 2+iT, (\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon)+iT$, traversed in the positive sense. Similarly, let $\mathcal C_1^{+}$ denote the contour with vertices $(\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon)-iT, 2-iT, 2, \frac{1}{2}+\epsilon$, also traversed in the positive sense. Decomposing $\mathcal D^{+}$ into $\mathcal C_0^{+}$ and $\mathcal C_1^{+}$ yields $\mathcal D^{+}:=\mathcal C_0^{+} \cup \mathcal C_1^{+}$, whereby $\mathcal D^{+}:=\mathcal C_0^{+} \cap \mathcal C_1^{+}=[\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon,2].$ Hence, the former integral $N_+(T)$ can be expressed as $$N_+(T)=\frac{1}{2 \pi}Im\left(\int_{\mathcal C_0^{+}} \frac{{\xi}^\prime (s)}{\xi(s)}ds\right)+\frac{1}{2 \pi}Im\left(\int_{\mathcal C_1^{+}} \frac{{\xi}^\prime (s)}{\xi(s)}ds\right).$$ Since $\xi$ is positive real on the portion of the real axis $\mathcal C_0^{+} \cap \mathcal C_1^{+}$, the argument of $\xi$ does not change there. Let $\tilde {\mathcal C_0^{+}}, \tilde {\mathcal C_1^{+}}$ denote $\mathcal C_0^{+}, \mathcal C_1^{+}$ without $\mathcal C_0^{+} \cap \mathcal C_1^{+}$. Therefore $$\begin{align*} N_+(T)& =\frac{1}{2 \pi}Im\left(\int_\tilde {\mathcal C_0^{+}} \frac{{\xi}^\prime (s)}{\xi(s)}ds\right)+\frac{1}{2 \pi}Im\left(\int_\tilde {\mathcal C_1^{+}} \frac{{\xi}^\prime (s)}{\xi(s)}ds\right)\\ & \equiv \frac{1}{2 \pi}Im\left(\int_\tilde {\mathcal C_0^{+}} \frac{{\zeta}^\prime (s)}{\zeta(s)}ds\right)+\frac{1}{2 \pi}Im\left(\int_\tilde {\mathcal C_1^{+}} \frac{{\zeta}^\prime (s)}{\zeta(s)}ds\right)\end{align*}$$ Since the set of zeros of $\zeta$ is discrete, we may assume no zero of $\zeta$ has imaginary part $T$. This integral can be decomposed into the contribution over the vertical lines, and over the one horizontal line. In particular, $$\begin{align*} \frac{1}{2 \pi}Im\left(\int_\tilde {\mathcal C_0^{+}} \frac{{\zeta}^\prime (s)}{\zeta(s)}ds\right) &= Im \left(i \int_0^{-T} \frac{{\zeta}^\prime ((\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon)+iy)}{\zeta(\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon)+iy)} dy+\int_{\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon}^{2} \frac{{\zeta}^\prime (\sigma-iT)}{\zeta(\sigma-iT)} d\sigma \right)\\ &=Im\left(\int_{\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon}^{2} \frac{{\zeta}^\prime (\sigma-iT)}{\zeta(\sigma-iT)} d\sigma \right)-Im \left(i \int_{-T}^{0} \frac{{\zeta}^\prime ((\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon)+iy)}{\zeta(\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon)+iy)} dy \right)\end{align*}$$ for which the integral over the vertical segment $[2-iT,2]$ vanishes, due to the boundedness of the total variation of $arg(\zeta(2+it))$ on the segment $[2-iT,2]$. It can be shown that $$\frac{\zeta^{\prime}(s)}{\zeta(s)}=-\frac{1}{s}-\frac{1}{s-1}+\frac{1}{2}log(\pi)+\sum_\rho \frac {1}{s-\rho}-\frac{1}{2}\frac{\Gamma^{\prime}(\frac{s}{2})}{\Gamma(\frac{s}{2})}=\sum_\rho \frac {1}{s-\rho}+O(log|t|),$$ for $\sigma \ge -1, |t| \ge 2.$ This, in turn, can be used to show $$\frac{\zeta^{\prime}(s)}{\zeta(s)}=\sum_{|\gamma_n-t|\le 1} \frac{1}{s-\rho_n}+O(log|t|),$$ with the same condition $\sigma \ge -1, |t| \ge 2.$ As such, it follows that $$\begin{align*}Im\left(\int_{\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon}^{2} \frac{{\zeta}^\prime (\sigma-iT)}{\zeta(\sigma-iT)} d\sigma \right)&=Im\left(\sum_{|\gamma_n-T| \le 1}\int_{\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon}^{2} \frac{d\sigma}{\sigma-it-\rho_n} \right)+Im\left(\sum_{|\gamma_n-T| \le 1}\int_{\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon}^{2} O(log|T|)dT \right)\\ &\equiv \sum_{|\gamma_n-T| \le 1}Im\left(\int_{\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon}^{2} \frac{d\sigma}{\sigma-it-\rho_n} \right)\end{align*}$$ By the Argument Principle, each summand equals the net change of $arg(s-\rho_n)$ on $[\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon-iT,2-iT]$; thus, its absolute value is less than $\pi.$ In similar vein, by the von Mangoldt estimate of the vertical density of roots $\rho_n$: $N(T+1)-N(T) \le \sum_{T \le \gamma_n \le T+1}1 < 2logT,$ the number of summands is less than $4logT.$ The modulus of the latter integral is $$\left |\sum_{|\gamma_n-T| \le 1}Im\left(\int_{\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon}^{2} \frac{d\sigma}{\sigma-it-\rho_n} \right) \right|<4\pi logT,$$ for large $T.$ Consequently $$\sum_{|\gamma_n-T| \le 1}Im\left(\int_{\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon}^{2} \frac{d\sigma}{\sigma-it-\rho_n} \right)=O(logT).$$ Similarly  $$\begin{align*}Im \left(i \int_{-T}^{0} \frac{{\zeta}^\prime ((\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon)+iy)}{\zeta(\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon)+iy)} dy \right)&=Im\left(i \int_{-T}^{0} \sum_{|\gamma_n-T|\le 1} \frac{dy}{(\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon)+iy-\rho_n}+i\int_{-T}^{0}O(log|T|)dy \right)\\ &=Im\left(i \sum_{|\gamma_n-T|\le 1} \int_{-T}^{0} \frac{dy}{(\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon)+iy-\rho_n}\right)+TO(log|T|)\end{align*}$$ As before, each summand equals the net change of $arg(s-\rho_n)$ on $[(\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon)-iT, \frac{1}{2}+\epsilon].$ Therefore, the absolute variation in the argument is less than $\pi.$ By the above estimate of $N(T+1)-N(T),$ the number of summands is less than $4logT.$ Thus $$Im\left(\sum_{|\gamma_n-T|\le 1} \int_{-T}^{0} \frac{dy}{(\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon)+iy-\rho_n}\right)+TO(log|T|)<4\pi logT $$ for large $T.$ Finally, $$\sum_{|\gamma_n-T|\le 1}Im\left(i \int_{-T}^{0} \frac{dy}{(\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon)+iy-\rho_n}\right)+TO(log|T|)=O(logT)+O(TlogT),$$ which implies that $$\frac{1}{2 \pi}Im\left(\int_\tilde {\mathcal C_0^{+}} \frac{{\zeta}^\prime (s)}{\zeta(s)}ds\right)=O(logT)-O(TlogT),$$ keeping the negative signature for convenience. Therefore $$N_+(T)=\frac{1}{2 \pi}Im\left(\int_\tilde {\mathcal C_1^{+}} \frac{{\zeta}^\prime (s)}{\zeta(s)}ds\right)+O(logT)-O(TlogT).$$ Using this formulation of Argument Principle, would the Riemann Hypothesis follow if it was shown that $$\frac{1}{2 \pi}Im\left(\int_\tilde {\mathcal C_1^{+}} \frac{{\zeta}^\prime (s)}{\zeta(s)}ds\right)$$ exactly cancels $O(logT)-O(TlogT)$ as $\epsilon$ tends to zero and as $T$ tends to infinity?

It can be shown that $$\frac{\zeta^{\prime}(s)}{\zeta(s)}=-\frac{1}{s}-\frac{1}{s-1}+\frac{1}{2}log(\pi)+\sum_\rho \frac {1}{s-\rho}-\frac{1}{2}\frac{\Gamma^{\prime}(\frac{s}{2})}{\Gamma(\frac{s}{2})}=\sum_\rho \frac {1}{s-\rho}+O(log|t|),$$ for $\sigma \ge -1, |t| \ge 2.$ This, in turn, can be used to show $$\frac{\zeta^{\prime}(s)}{\zeta(s)}=\sum_{|\gamma_n-t|\le 1} \frac{1}{s-\rho_n}+O(log|t|),$$ with the same condition $\sigma \ge -1, |t| \ge 2.$ As such, it follows that $$\begin{align*}Im\left(\int_{\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon}^{2} \frac{{\zeta}^\prime (\sigma-iT)}{\zeta(\sigma-iT)} d\sigma \right)&=Im\left(\sum_{|\gamma_n-T| \le 1}\int_{\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon}^{2} \frac{d\sigma}{\sigma-it-\rho_n} \right)+Im\left(\sum_{|\gamma_n-T| \le 1}\int_{\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon}^{2} O(log|T|)dT \right)\\ &\equiv \sum_{|\gamma_n-T| \le 1}Im\left(\int_{\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon}^{2} \frac{d\sigma}{\sigma-it-\rho_n} \right)\end{align*}$$ By the Argument Principle, each summand equals the net change of $arg(s-\rho_n)$ on $[\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon-iT,2-iT]$; thus, its absolute value is less than $\pi.$ In similar vein, by the von Mangoldt estimate of the vertical density of roots $\rho_n$: $N(T+1)-N(T) \le \sum_{T \le \gamma_n \le T+1}1 < 2logT,$ the number of summands is less than $4logT.$ The modulus of the latter integral is $$\left |\sum_{|\gamma_n-T| \le 1}Im\left(\int_{\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon}^{2} \frac{d\sigma}{\sigma-it-\rho_n} \right) \right|<4\pi logT,$$ for large $T.$ Consequently $$\sum_{|\gamma_n-T| \le 1}Im\left(\int_{\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon}^{2} \frac{d\sigma}{\sigma-it-\rho_n} \right)=O(logT).$$ Similarly  $$\begin{align*}Im \left(i \int_{-T}^{0} \frac{{\zeta}^\prime ((\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon)+iy)}{\zeta(\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon)+iy)} dy \right)&=Im\left(i \int_{-T}^{0} \sum_{|\gamma_n-T|\le 1} \frac{dy}{(\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon)+iy-\rho_n}+i\int_{-T}^{0}O(log|T|)dy \right)\\ &=Im\left(i \sum_{|\gamma_n-T|\le 1} \int_{-T}^{0} \frac{dy}{(\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon)+iy-\rho_n}\right)+TO(log|T|)\end{align*}$$ As before, each summand equals the net change of $arg(s-\rho_n)$ on $[(\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon)-iT, \frac{1}{2}+\epsilon].$ Therefore, the absolute variation in the argument is less than $\pi.$ By the above estimate of $N(T+1)-N(T),$ the number of summands is less than $4logT.$ Thus $$Im\left(\sum_{|\gamma_n-T|\le 1} \int_{-T}^{0} \frac{dy}{(\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon)+iy-\rho_n}\right)+TO(log|T|)<4\pi logT $$ for large $T.$ Finally, $$\sum_{|\gamma_n-T|\le 1}Im\left(i \int_{-T}^{0} \frac{dy}{(\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon)+iy-\rho_n}\right)+TO(log|T|)=O(logT)+O(TlogT),$$ which implies that $$\frac{1}{2 \pi}Im\left(\int_\tilde {\mathcal C_0^{+}} \frac{{\zeta}^\prime (s)}{\zeta(s)}ds\right)=O(logT)-O(TlogT),$$ keeping the negative signature for convenience. Therefore $$N_+(T)=\frac{1}{2 \pi}Im\left(\int_\tilde {\mathcal C_1^{+}} \frac{{\zeta}^\prime (s)}{\zeta(s)}ds\right)+O(logT)-O(TlogT).$$ Using this formulation of Argument Principle, would the Riemann Hypothesis follow if it was shown that $$\frac{1}{2 \pi}Im\left(\int_\tilde {\mathcal C_1^{+}} \frac{{\zeta}^\prime (s)}{\zeta(s)}ds\right)$$ exactly cancels $O(logT)-O(TlogT)$ as $\epsilon$ tends to zero and as $T$ tends to infinity? In addition to this, is there a differential-geometric approach to the Riemann Hypothesis?
