Purported Proof Lemma 2. Let $X$ be a compact Hausdorff space and $A$ be a closed set in $X$ . Let $U$ be neighborhood of $A$ . Then there is a neighborhood $O$ of $A$ in $X$ such that $\bar O\subseteq U$ . Proof. Restatement of the fact that compact Hausdorff spaces are normal. Lemma 3. Let $X$ be a compact Hausdorff space and $O$ be a neighborhood of $\Delta_2(X)$ in $X^2$ . Then there is an open cover $\mc V$ of $X$ such that $$ (V\cup V')\times (V\cup V') \subseteq O $$ whenever $V, V'\in \mc V$ are such that $V\cap V'\neq \emptyset$ . Proof. We say that an open cover $\mc U$ of $X$ if good if $\overline{\bigcup_{U\in \mc U} U\times U} $ is contained in $O$ . It is clear from Lemma 2 and from compactness of $X$ that finite good open covers of $X$ exist. Also, given an open cover $\mc U$ of $X$ , we say that $G$ in $\mc U$ is well-behaved if whenever $G\cap U\neq \emptyset$ for some $U$ in $\mc U$ , we have $(G\cup U)\times (G\cup U)$ is contained in $O$ . Let $\mc U=\set{U_1, \ldots, U_m, G_1, \ldots, G_n}$ be a be an arbitrary finite good open cover of $X$ , where each $G_i$ is well-behaved and each $U_i$ is not well-behaved. If $m=0$ then we are done. So assume that $m\geq 1$ . It automatically follows that then $m\geq 2$ . We will construct a finite good open cover of $X$ which has fewer ill-behaved elements. By Lemma 2 we know that there is a neighborhood $Q$ of $\Delta_2(X)$ which contained $\overline{\bigcup_{U\in \mc U} U\times U}$ such that $\bar Q\subseteq O$ . Let $K$ be the boundary of $U_1\cup \cdots \cup U_{m-1}$ . For each $p$ in $K$ , let $W_p$ be a neighborhood of $p$ in $X$ such that $W_p$ is contained in $G_i$ whenever $W_p\cap G_i\neq \emptyset$ , and $(W_p\cup U_i)\times (W_p\cup U_i)\subseteq Q$ whenever $W_p\cap U_i$ is not empty. The existence of $W_p$ can be established by a compactness argument. Since $K$ is compact, there is a finite set $F$ of $K$ such that $\set{W_p:\ p\in F}$ covers $K$ . Define $U_m'=U_m\setminus \overline{U_1\cup \cdots \cup U_{m-1}}$ and $$ \mc U' = \set{U_1, \ldots, U_{m-1}, U_m', G_1, \ldots, G_n} \cup \set{W_p:\ p\in F} $$ It is easy to check that $U_m'$ as well as each $G_i$ is well-behaved in $\mc U'$ . Also, $\overline{\bigcup_{U'\in \mc U'} U'\times U'}$ is contained in $Q$ , and hence $\mc U'$ is a good open cover. This finishes the proof. $\blacksquare$ Theorem 4. Let $X$ be a compact Hausdorff space and $O$ be a neighborhood of $\Delta_2(X)$ in $X^2$ . Then there is a neighborhood $Q$ of $\Delta_2(X)$ such that whenever $(x, y)$ and $(y, z)$ are in $Q$ for some $x, y, z\in X$ , we have $(x, z)\in O$ . Proof. Let $\mc U$ be an open cover of $X$ such that whenever $U$ and $U'$ in $\mc U$ are such that $U\cap U' \neq \emptyset$ , we have $(U\cup U')\times (U\cup U')$ is contained in $O$ . Such an open cover is furnished by Lemma 3. Define $Q=\bigcup_{U\in \mc U} U\times U$ . Now let $(x, y)$ and $(y, z)$ be in $Q$ for some $x, y, z\in X$ . Then there are $U$ and $U'$ in $\mc U$ such that $(x, y)\in U\times U$ and $(y, z)\in U'\times U'$ . Thus $U\cap U'$ is non-empty, and thus $(U\times U')\times (U\times U')$ is contained in $O$ .

38,The relationship between the Euler characteristic and the fundamental group of finite connected graphs,The relationship between the Euler characteristic and the fundamental group of finite connected graphs,,"I have been asked to conjecture a relationship between the Euler characteristic and the fundamental group of finite connected graphs and, if possible, to prove the conjecture. We know that if the finite connected graph $G$ is a tree, then its Euler characteristic is $\chi(G)=1$ and its fundamental group is trivial $\pi_1(G)=\{e\}$ . If $G$ is the triangulation of an $n$ -bouquet, $\textit{i.e.}$ a union of $n$ circles all intersecting at one point, then we may observe that its Euler characteristic is given by $\chi(G)=1-n$ , and its fundamental group is known to be $\pi_1(G) \cong \mathbb{Z}^n$ . This gives the relationship $\pi_1(G) \cong \mathbb{Z}^{1-\chi(G)}$ in the case of an $n$ -bouquet. But, of course, not every finite connected graph falls neatly into one of the above two categories, and, in general, the fundamental group is not free. I suppose one might consider every finite connected graph as a union of graphs in one of the above two categories, and hence arrive at a general statement, but I cannot seem to see how one would go about this.

39,Rudin's Construction of Inductive Limit Topology: unnecessarily abstruse?,Rudin's Construction of Inductive Limit Topology: unnecessarily abstruse?,,"In Rudin's Functional Analysis Book, one of the examples in the first chapter is used later in the chapter on distributions. But when he gets to defining the inductive limit topology on a certain space, it seems unnecessarily abstruse and confusing to me, (probably because I am missing something essential). I want to check that I understand the ideas, and know if there is a particular reason for Rudin's definition. Here is the way he sets it up in Chapter one: take an open set $\Omega\subseteq \mathbb R^n$ , a compact $K\subseteq \Omega$ and define $\mathcal D_K$ to be the collection of $C^{\infty}(\mathbb R^n)$ functions supported in $K$ . Then, let $\{K_n\}$ be an exhaustion of $\Omega$ , so that the norms $p_N(f) = \max \{D^{\alpha}f(x): x\in  K_N;\ |\alpha|<N\}$ , (where $\alpha $ of course is a multi-index) induce a topology on $C^{\infty}(\Omega)$ , and $\mathcal D_K$ is a closed subspace whenever $K\subset \Omega.$ Now, in the chapter on distributions, Rudin goes on to define $\mathcal D(\Omega)=\bigcup_{K\subset \Omega}\mathcal D_K$ and topologizes this by a collection of norms whose restriction to each $\mathcal D_K$ induces the same topology as that induced by the $p_N$ . But $\mathcal D(\Omega)$ is not complete in this topology, so we look for a finer one that works. I see this as: to control what happens at the boundary of $\Omega$ we'd like to add seminorms to the ones we already have, until we get a complete space. The foregoing seems to be just the right setup for defining the topology we want on $\mathcal D(\Omega)$ to be the inductive limit topology, (even if we don't use the name) because clearly the inclusions $\mathcal D_{K_n}\to \mathcal D_{K_{n+1}}$ are continuous, so if we define $\tau_{D(\Omega)}$ to be the finest topology that makes the inclusions $\mathcal D_N\to \mathcal D(\Omega)$ continuous, then the results obtained in the rest of the chapter follow (more intuitively and clearly?) from this definition. In fact, this definition implies that for $\textit{any}$ seminorm $p$ on $\mathcal D(\Omega)$ ,  we have that $p$ is continuous if and only if its restriction to $\mathcal D _K$ is continuous for each $K\subset \Omega.$ So we could also just have declared the desired topology to be that induced by the collection $\mathscr P$ of seminorms $p$ that satisfy: $p\in \mathscr P\Leftrightarrow p|_{\mathcal D_K}$ is continuous. In fact, using this, I was able to get all the proofs that Rudin obtained by his characterization of the topology: $a).\ $ Let $\beta$ be the collection of all convex balanced sets $W\subseteq \mathcal D(\Omega)$ such that $\mathcal D_K\cap W\in \tau_K$ for every compact $K\subset \Omega.$ $b).\ $ the desired topology is then the collection of unions of the sets $\phi + W;\ \phi\in \mathcal D(\Omega)$ . In the first place, given the setup, why go to this more abstract approach? Why not do it the way the setup seems to lead naturally? I think part $a).$ is a restatment of the above definition $p\in \mathscr P\Leftrightarrow p|_{\mathcal D_K}$ is continuous, in which case, all is well. In any case, wouldn't it just be cleaner to note that, as we already have topologies on the $\mathcal D_K$ , why not just use the above definition in the first place? That is, topologize $\mathcal D(\Omega)$ by taking all seminorms on $\mathcal D(\Omega)$ such that their restrictions to each $\mathcal D_K$ are continuous.","In Rudin's Functional Analysis Book, one of the examples in the first chapter is used later in the chapter on distributions.

Pick a closed ball $\Phi = \overline{B(x, r)} = \{y \in X \ | \ d(x, y) \leq r\}$.

For ""if"", I prove by contraposition. Let $U\subset X$ be a compact subset of $X$ and $U$ is not closed in $\tau$. Define a finer topology $\tau':=\tau\cup\{X\setminus U\}$, and we show that $(X, \tau')$ is compact. Let $S$ be a subbasis of $(X,\tau')$ and let $S'\subseteq S$ be an open cover of $X$. By Alexander subbase theorem: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subbase#Alexander_subbase_theorem , it's enough to show that $S'$ has a finite subcover. Since $X\setminus U\in\tau'$, it is the finite intersection of elements in $S$. But this is not good enough because ideally I want to express $X\setminus U$ (and $U$) as a finite intersection of sets in $S'$, in order obtain a finite subcover of $S'$. How can I get around this? Let $X\setminus U=\cap_{k\leq n}S_k$ be a finite intersection of sets in $S$.

More generally, $A^\circ$ must be homeomorphic to $\Bbb R^n$, so it must in fact be simply connected. For similar reasons, $A$ cannot be nowhere dense. $A^\circ$ must be bounded. If not, take some sequence $(x_n)\in A^\circ$ that diverges to infinity (and satisfies $d(x_m,x_n)\ge1$ for $m\ne n$), and take a subsequence that converges in $S^n$ (necessarily to the pole). Then $A\setminus\bigcup_n\bar B(x_n,\frac12\min(d(x_n,\partial A),1))$ is open in $A$, because all the closed sets in the union are separated from each other, and it contains $\partial A$, hence the image is an open set containing the pole and missing all the $x_n$'s, a contradiction.",,"['general-topology', 'complex-analysis']"

I cite: It is often necessary to choose an orientation $\mu_x$ for each tangent space $M_x$ of a manifold $M$. Such choices are called consistent provided that for every coordinate system $f : W \to \mathbb R^n$ and $a, b \in W$ the relation   $$  [f_{\ast}((e_1)_a), \ldots, f_{\ast}((e_k))_a] = \mu_{f(a)} $$   holds if and only if   $$  [f_{\ast}((e_1)_b), \ldots, f_{\ast}((e_k)_b)] = \mu_{f(b)}. $$ For the notation. With $v_p$ he denotes the tangent vector $v$ at the point $p$, for a function $f : A \to \mathbb R^m$ with $A \subseteq \mathbb R^n$ differentiable on $A$ we have $f_{\ast}(v_p) := (Df(p)(v))_{f(p)}$ and for a basis $v_1, \ldots, v_n$ he denotes by $[v_1, \ldots, v_n]$ the orientation of $v_1, \ldots, v_n$. Also a coordinate system is defined as: A subset $M$ of $\mathbb R^n$ is a $k$-dimensional manifold if and only if for each point $x \in M$ the following ''coordinate condition'' is satisfied: (C) There is an open set $U$ containting $x$, an open set $W \subseteq R^k$, and a $1-1$ differentiable function $f : W \to \mathbb R^n$ such that (1) $f(W) = M \cap U$, (2) $f'(y)$ has rank $k$ for each $y \in W$, (3) $f^{-1} : f(W) \to W$ is continuous. Such a function $f$ is called a coordinate system around $x$. Now my question, I totally do not understand his definition of orientability of a manifold. If I got him right he requires that we find a number $\mu_x$ for each point $x$ on the manifold, which fulfills a compatibility condition for every coordinate system. As $\det Df(p) \ne 0$ for each $p \in W$, I see that this determinant could not switch sign, but otherwise it could vary continuously. So it does not make sense to have a numbers $\mu_x$ and require the above condition for all coordinate systems, as by composition with diffeomorphisms we can change the coordinate system and take care that the determinant might have different values (despite still having all the same sign). So this might be an error and instead ''for all coordinate'' systems, he means ''for each $x$ there exists a coordinate system such that'' (i.e. we have an atlas whose transition maps have determinants with the same sign, which is closer to other definitions I found). Another possiblity is how $[\cdot,\cdots,\cdot]$ is precisely defined, as he just wrote it denotes the orientation (or equivalence class), but such an class is not a number, its a set of ordered bases, but could be represented by a number, so $[\cdot,\cdots,\cdot] \in \mathbb R$, but maybe we have $[\cdot,\cdots,\cdot]\in\{-1,1\}$ which would make some more sense. Other definitions I found are that the existence of a $n$-form $\omega$ on $M$ is asserted such that $\omega(p)$ is strictly positive on the tangent space at $p$, or that we could find an atlas such that the transition maps have positive determinant, or the definitions from here which I hardly understand.","In Spivak Calculus on Manifolds the author uses a definition of orientation of a manifold which I do not understand, and which I do not found elsewhere.
