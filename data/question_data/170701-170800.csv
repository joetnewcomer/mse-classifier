0,Exponential Distribution - Probabilities,Exponential Distribution - Probabilities,,"I'm trying to figure out the answer to the following question on a past exam given for practice. Since there are no solutions, I was hoping I could get the help needed to figure it out. A BS1300 big-screen TV may die due to screen failure or power supply failure. The time until power supply failure is exponential with parameter 0.00001. The time until screen failure is exponential with parameter 0.00002. The time is in hours. a) Which failure is more probable to occur first? For this problem, I simply got the expected values and whichever was lower, it should be more probable as the time expected for it to fail was lower. $E(X) = 100000$ hours for power supply, $E(X) = 50000$ hours for screen failure. Therefore, screen is more likely to fail first. b) What is the probability that a BS1300 will die within 10000 hours? PS = power supply, SF = screen failure $P(PS = 10000) = 0.000016374 P(SF = 10000) = 0.000025422$. If we add it up, we get PS or SF $= 0.000025422$. c) If the BS1300 is known to be dead, what is the probability that its power supply failed? Part c), I'm not sure how to figure this out. I tried drawing a venn diagram but I'm unsure how to do it for exponential. Help would be appreciated on how to solve this problem.","I'm trying to figure out the answer to the following question on a past exam given for practice.

Thanks for your insight and thoughts.","I have the following passage from a set of lecture notes I am working on that I would like to understand a little better. $\underline{\text{Algorithm for Rejection Sampling}}$: Given two densities $f$, $g$, with $f(x) < M.g(x)$ for all $x$, and some constant $M$, we can generate a sample from $f$ by Draw $X \sim g$ Accept $X$ as a sample from $f$ with probability $\large \frac{f(X)}{M.g(X)}$ otherwise go back to step 1. Now, I understand why this will generate samples from the distribution with density $f$, but I really do not understand how to use this algorithm in practice. I draw an $X$ from the distribution with density $g$, and then I need to decide whether to keep it, or reject it.  I don't understand the condition to accept it... do I accept it if the probability defined in 2. is greater than e.g. 0.5, or maybe 0.7? Is this probability up to me to decide?

To make it concrete, if I get a sample of [50,51,52] from a normally-distributed set, I should be able to calculate a fairly high confidence that 50% of the population lies within the range of 0-100, even with such a small sample. This is certainly related to the ""tolerance interval"", but differs in an important way. In all of the examples I can find for tolerance intervals, the required percentile and confidence is given, and the interval is found. In my problem, the interval and percentile are given, and I need to find the confidence. The relevant equation is this one: (Guttman 1970) $$1 - \gamma = P\left[P(X \geqq t_0) \geqq 1 - p\right] = P\left[T_{n-1}^*(\sqrt n z_p) \leqq \sqrt n K\right]$$ With definitions: $1 - \gamma$ is the confidence $n$ is the number of samples $100p$ is the percentage of the population required to be within the interval, as estimated from the sample mean and sample variance. $t_0 = x - K_{S, z_p}$ is the $(1 - p) 100$th percentile of the standard normal distribution $T_v^*(\delta)$ is the noncentral Student’s t distribution with $v$ degrees of freedom and noncentrality parameter $\delta$. This solves the one-sided problem, but I'm having trouble extending this to the two-sided problem. In confidence-interval land, I'd use the fact that $P(t_1 \leqq X \leqq t_2) = 1 - P(t_1 \gt X) - P(X \gt t_2)$, to break this into two one-sided problems, but in tolerance-interval land I need to relate these back to the confidence ($1-\gamma$), and I don't see how. $$1 - \gamma = P\left[P(t_1 \geqq X \geqq t_2) \geqq 1 - p\right] = ??? $$ If I attempt to turn this into two one-sided problems: $$1 - \gamma = P\left[1 - P(t_1 \lt X) - P(X \lt t_2) \geqq 1 - p\right] = ??? $$ And I'm utterly stuck there. I don't see how to relate this back to the one-sided tolerance interval solution. I'm not certain this is useful for people to understand the question, but it might, so I'm putting it in this addenda.

96,Regression with arbitrary norm,Regression with arbitrary norm,,"I have a function $f(X,Y,Z)$, which I know is polynomial of degree $3$. I have a set of samples $(X_i,Y_i,Z_i)$ and corresponding values of $f$. My task is to find (the best approximation of) the coefficients of the polynomial with the data in hand. I can do this with least-squares approximation in Matlab but the problem is that least-squares minimizes the Euclidean distance from points to the model (i.e. the error) and I need to use totally different norm for the error than Euclidean distance. How should I approach this? In a high level the polynomial handles input and output in some space $A$ but I should choose the coefficients in such a way that the distance (error) in space $B$ would be minimal. The transformation between $A$ and $B$ is not linear, but it doesn't look too complicated (I haven't figured out all the details yet). If it matters, $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ are in the range $[0,255]$ (in $A$).","I have a function $f(X,Y,Z)$, which I know is polynomial of degree $3$.
