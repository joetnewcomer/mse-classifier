0,Did Gauss and colleagues consider measuring the curvature of the universe?,Did Gauss and colleagues consider measuring the curvature of the universe?,,"The interpretation usually given for Gauss' Theorema Egregium is that a being living on a surface with intrinsic curvature can detect that curvature just by walking around the surface and measuring angles and distances.  With the advent of general relativity many years later, it became evident that the our 3+1 dimensional universe need not be flat, and the Theorema Egregium is the basis for several experimental efforts to measure the curvature of the universe. Question: Did it ever occur to Gauss or other geometers of that era to measure the curvature of the universe? [ Bonus: If not, who was the first to propose that the universe might be curved?  Einstein?] I imagine there may have been a conceptual difficulty due to the fact that most differential geometry done in the early days was restricted to curves and surfaces, rather than 3-manifolds.

1,Dividing a rectangle into a grid of rectangles/squares,Dividing a rectangle into a grid of rectangles/squares,,"I'm writing a program where I need to divide a large rectangle into small pieces, no constraint on being exactly equally sized or exactly rectangle(they can be a square as well) and even if they protrude out of the larger rectangle a little, it'll be fine. I know how to divide a rectangle into some number of rectangles, but my current situation is making it difficult to visualize how many rectangles should I divide it into. Let me explain the scenario - I've been given a large rectangle with n number of uniformly distributed points inside it and I've to make smaller rectangles so that each rectangle has ~10^3-10^4 points in it. The n can vary easily from 10^5 - 10^8 and even above. My idea is to cluster those points into smaller rectangles so that I don't have to compare all points linearly and just compare their bounding rectangles to the geometric figure. So in earlier case, I would be comparing millions of points for each geometric figure, now I would be comparing much much less number of bounding rectangles. For now I've hardcoded the values eg. 1000 smaller rectangles for 10^6 number of points and like that for 10^7 and 10^8. But it has a disadvantage that instead of calculating for continuous range, I'm hard coding for discrete range which does not work for 5000000 number of points or any such in middle. Also, they are usually made into thin strips which makes them very hard to fall completely within the geometric shape I'm comparing with. I hope I've explained it clearly, but I'll provide a TLDR; Given a rectangle with n number of points uniformly distributed inside it, split that rectangle into smalle rectangles with 10^3-10^4 number of points in each of them. Also, the naive solution like dividing into very slim strips does not work for me because then most strips only intersect with geometric figure rather than falling within it completely, it would be preferable for an algorithm/function to make somewhat both axis uniform boxes. ________                           ________ | | | | |   <-- slim strips         |   |   |   <-- much better | | | | |                           |---|---| |_|_|_|_|                           |___|___|","I'm writing a program where I need to divide a large rectangle into small pieces, no constraint on being exactly equally sized or exactly rectangle(they can be a square as well) and even if they protrude out of the larger rectangle a little, it'll be fine.

It   also means that the composition of two   rotations is also a rotation. But asteroids do rotate around two axes. Look at the videos from this website: http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/asteroids/features.html The Spin of Asteroid Toutatis By making a series of observations, it   is possible to study the rotation of   some asteroids. Most have simple   rotations around a fixed axis, with   periods typically between one hour and   one day. For example, here is a movie   (83 kB MPEG) made by the Hubble Space   Telescope of the asteroid Vesta in   rotation (Ref). However, the asteroid   4179 Toutatis (which crosses Earth's   orbit) has been found through radio   telescope observations to have an   irregular shape and a complex tumbling   rotation---both thought to arise from   a history of violent collisions. Here   is a short animation (47 kB MPEG) of   the spin of Toutatis; here is a longer   animation (288 kB MPEG). Here are the movies: http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/asteroids/toutspin.mpg and http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/asteroids/toutspin2.mpg You can clearly see that those rotations are not possible around one axis. But then isn't it contradicting Euler's rotation theorem?",,"['geometry', 'euclidean-geometry', 'physics', 'rotations']"

15,What is the $\inf$ and $\sup$ of the area of quadrilateral given its sides length?,What is the  and  of the area of quadrilateral given its sides length?,\inf \sup,"Now asked on MO here . Given the length of the sides of a quadrilateral $a,b,c,d$ the area of the quadrilateral is less than or equal to $\frac{(a+b+c+d)^2}{16}$ i.e it is an upper bound of the area of  any quadrilateral  with side length $a,b,c,d$ . A question that came to my mind is if $\frac{(a+b+c+d)^2}{16}$ is an upper bound Then the least upper bound exits so what is the infimum  and supremum of the area of quadrilateral (0 is an oblivious lower bound so the infimum   exists too)? I made a silly mistake thinking that $\frac{(a+b+c+d)^2}{16}$ is the supremum but it turns out I was wrong. If $a=b, \ c=d$ ""a kite"" or if $a=c, \   d=b$ ""a parallelogram"" then it is easy to prove the infimum  is $0$ and the supremum  is just $a^2$ when it is a rhombus. The infimum  depends on $a,b,c,d$ in this examples the side lengths are $19,13,7,4$ and the minimum area is around $9.5$ so it is not $0$ . Conjecture: If $a<b<c<d$ and the area of the quadrilateral  is $S$ then $\inf S $ is the area of the triangle $a,b,d-c$ which is $$\sqrt{\frac{a+b+d-c}{2}\cdot\frac{a-b+d-c}{2}\cdot\frac{-a+b+d-c}{2}\cdot\frac{a+b-d+c}{2}}$$ This also works when $a=b=c=d, \ \ \ a=b, \ c=d \ \ \  ,a=c, \ d=b $ .

I've found the following problem in an old exercise list a teacher gave me: If each of the three diagonals of a convex hexagon divides it into regions of the same area, show that the three diagonals meet at the same point. In the image below I marked the areas determined by the diagonals. My first impulse was to try to show that $P = 0$ . For this I set up the following system: $$\begin{cases} T/2 &= A+B+Y\\ T/2 &= B+C+Z\\ T/2 &= C+A+X\\ T/2 &= X+Y+A+P\\ T/2 &= Y+Z+B+P\\ T/2 &= Z+X+C+P\\ \end{cases}$$ Where $T = A+B+C+X+Y+Z+P$ is the hexagon's total area. The system may be simplified to $$\begin{cases} A &= Z+P\\ B &= X+P\\ C &= Y+P \end{cases}$$ but I don't see how to proceed from that point. Also, I wonder if the same statement is true by replacing the hexagon with a $2n-$ agon. Of course, in this case, writing a system with the areas would become unfeasible, so a smarter approach would be needed.

In this case $$(CP)^{2}= 10^{2}+10^{2}-2(10)(10)\cos30^{\circ}$$ $$(CP)^{2}= 10^{2} \left(1+1-2\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\right)$$ $$CP = 10 \sqrt{ 2-\sqrt{3}}$$ Therefore $CP = 10 \sqrt{ 2-\sqrt{3}}$ and we have all the parts so the rest is just adding them up. $$CP+PB= BC = 10 \sqrt{ 2-\sqrt{3}} + \frac{10}{\sqrt{2}}$$ $$AB= \frac{10}{\sqrt{2}}$$ $$AB + BC = \frac{10}{\sqrt{2}} + 10 \sqrt{ 2-\sqrt{3}} + \frac{10}{\sqrt{2}}$$ And that's how far I went, but from then on I don't know if what I did was correct or did I missed something? as my answer doesn't appear within the alternatives. The best I could come up with by simplifying was: $$\frac{10\sqrt{2}}{2}+10\sqrt{2-\sqrt{3}}+\frac{10\sqrt{2}}{2}$$ $$10\sqrt{2}+10\sqrt{2-\sqrt{3}}$$ $$10\left(\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{2-\sqrt{3}}\right)$$ and, that's it. But it doesn't seem to be in the choices given. Can somebody help me to find if did I do something wrong?.

First, the polyiamond has to actually fit into a corner - i.e., there is some 60-degree angle the tile covers the tip of without exceeding its bounds. Second, we have a simple coloring argument: the number of right-side-up and upside-down triangles in the tile can't be the same, because in an equilateral triangle there are more of one than the other. Applying these two conditions to all the polyiamonds on at most 4 triangles as listed e.g. here , every case is either immediately ruled out or can be easily seen to work for every triangle of a plausible side length (i.e., $s$ such that $s^2$ is a multiple of the number of triangles in the tile). For the pentiamonds, we have: C $5$ : Can't fit in the corner, ruled out. L $5$ : If placed in the corner, it leaves a $60$ degree angle void which must be filled by a piece in the same orientation, which repeats infinitely and never fits into the other corner of an equilateral triangle: P $5$ : Can be ruled out by a small amount of casework: there's only one way to place the first piece in the corner, and then a second triangle in the ""concave part"" of the piece can only be filled in one way, but placing those two pieces leaves a void that can't be filled.

Since $S(n)$ has a maximum at $n=7.256...$ one get't two positive solutions: $$ n=1.534...\\ n=15.86... $$ (see https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2Pi%5E(n%2F2)%2FGamma(n%2F2)+%3D%3D+4 ). Now my questions is: Since the number of dimensions of the n-sphere from this equation is a non-integer, does that mean such a sphere would be a fractal ? If so, is it possible to construct a n-sphere with 1.534 dimensions somehow and draw it?",,"['geometry', 'gamma-function', 'fractals', 'dimension-theory-analysis', 'spheres']"

Since there are a total of $100$ integral points, two cases are possible: 1) radius of the circle is integer. 2) radius of the circle is not an integer. case 1: If radius is an integer, then $4$ points on the $x$-axis and $y$-axis of the circle would be integral points and hence each octant must have $12$ points(as $100-4=96$ is a multiple of $8$). therefore, this case is consistent. case2: If radius is not an integer, then $100$ integral points can't be divided into $8$ parts(octants),and points on $x$-axis and $y$-axis of circle are not integral points, therefore points on line $x=y$ and $x+y=0$ must be integral points so as to divide $100-4=96$ points in $8$ parts.
