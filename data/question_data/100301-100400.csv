0,Visual research problems in geometry,Visual research problems in geometry,,"I am considering doing research in mathematics to be my career (and my life) someday. I'm a visually oriented person in general; for example, I prefer chess over cards because when I play chess, I do all my thinking by looking at the board and analyzing it, but when I play cards, I have to remember things and calculate things because the details are not visible or visual. That's why I did very well with traditional plane geometry problems at school. I was good at problems that can be visually explained or visually modeled, like proving the equality of two line segments or two angles just by looking at the figure. It has always been more interesting for me than Algebra where I had to write down terms and rearrange them to reach the solution. Now I am wondering if there is a branch of modern advanced mathematics that works the same way to be my research interest. I am looking for the kind of problems that I can call ""visual puzzles"": problems that can be solved by looking at them. Is there such a field in modern mathematics that I can do research in? I realize the importance of algebra and mathematical logic, and I know that I must use them, and I like to use them. I am considering discrete geometry, but I am not sure if its problems are really visual. I have been looking for the advanced branches of geometry in the universities research pages and I downloaded many research papers and books just to look at the advanced fields of geometry from inside and see how it ""looks"" like. I didn't understand anything for sure. :-) I found topics like non-euclidean geometry, differential geometry, topology and Riemann geometry, among others. What really disappointed me is that I couldn't find a lot of figures! I need your help to find the most interesting field for me. Thank you.","I am considering doing research in mathematics to be my career (and my life) someday.

6,Polynomial approximation of circle or ellipse,Polynomial approximation of circle or ellipse,,"Trying again, with a somewhat simpler sounding question, since my previous one ( Generalizations of equi-oscillation criterion ) got zero response: Let $F:[0,1] \to R^2$ be a parametric polynomial curve of degree $m$.

More specifically, I want to have $F(0) = (1,0)$, and $F(1) = (0,1)$, and I want the maximum distance  $$E_1 = \max \{dist(F(t),C): t \in [0,1]\}$$ to be minimized.

The inequality below is true: $$a^2x+b^2y+c^2z\geq 4[ABC]\sqrt{xy+xz+yz}$$ Various inequalities can be deduced through this inequality, for example, Weitzenböck's inequality, Neuberg-Pedoe inequality, Hadwiger-Finsler inequality, and so on.

Usually the inner product is defined with respect to the standard basis $E=\{\hat e_1,\hat e_2 \}$ (for $n=2$ to simplify notations), the standard definition is: $$ \langle \vec x,\vec y\rangle_E=x_1y_1+x_2y_2 $$ Where  $$ \begin{bmatrix} x_1\\x_2 \end{bmatrix} =[\vec x]_E \qquad \begin{bmatrix} y_1\\y_2 \end{bmatrix} =[\vec y]_E $$ are the components of the two vectors in the standard basis and, by definition of the inner product, $\hat e_1$ and $\hat e_2$ are orho-normal.

This means that any two linearly independent vectors are orthogonal with respect to a suitable inner product defined by  a suitable basis. So orthogonality seems  a ''coordinate dependent'' concept.

16,How fat is a triangle?,How fat is a triangle?,,"The slimness factor of a geometric shape in 2 dimensions is the ratio between the side-length of its smallest containing square and its largest contained square. This is an important factor in computational geometry. So the slimness of a square is 1, the slimness of a circle is $\sqrt 2$, but what is the slimness factor of a given triangle? After trying unsuccessfully to solve this geometrically, I decided to try a purely analytical solution. Here it is: The triangle The fatness obviously does not depend on scale. Hence two parameters are sufficient to define the triangle. I choose as parameters an angle $\theta$ adjacent to the longest side and the ratio $D$ between the side next to that angle and the longest side.  We have to find the fatness as a function of $\theta$ and $D$. Normalize the triangle so that its longest side lies on the x axis, between $(0,0)$ and $(1,0)$. Define $\theta$ as the angle at the origin. Rotate the triangle such that $\theta$ is between $0^\circ$ and $90^\circ$. For brevity, let $C=\cos \theta$ and $S=\sin \theta$. $D$ is the length of the side starting at the origin, so that the 3rd vertex of the triangle is at $(DC,DS)$, where $0<D<1$, $0\leq C<1$ and $0\leq S<1$. The slimness factor should be calculated as a function of the parameters $D$, $C$ and $S$. The containing square Consider the unit square $[0,1]\times[0,1]$. We want to transform it so that it contains the triangle. A general transformation of a point $(x,y)$ is: $(rcx+rsy+h, rsx-rcy+v)$ where: $r$ is the dilation factor, $s$ and $c$ are sine and cosine of the rotation angle (we can assume they are both in $[0,1]$ because of the rotational symmetry of the square), $h$ is horizontal translation and $v$ is vertical translation. So a general transformation of the unit square has the following corners: $(h,v)$ $(rc+h,rs+v)$ $(rs+h,-rc+v)$ $(rc+rs+h, rs-rc+v)$ and the following sides: $s(x-h)=c(y-v)$ $s(x-h-rs)=c(y-v+rc)$ which is the same as $s(x-h)=c(y-v)+r$ $c(x-h)=-s(y-v)$ $c(x-h-rc)=-s(y-v-rs)$ which is the same as $c(x-h)=-s(y-v)+r$ In order to contain the triangle, each vertex $(x,y)$ of the triangle must be in the 4 half-planes defined by the 4 sides of the square: $c(y-v)\leq s(x-h)\leq c(y-v)+r$ $-s(y-v)\leq c(x-h)\leq -s(y-v)+r$ Now, substitute each of the 3 vertices of the triangle and get, for $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$ and $(DC,DS)$ respectively: $-cv\leq -sh\leq -cv+r$ $sv\leq -ch\leq sv+r$ $-cv\leq s-sh\leq -cv+r$ $sv\leq c-ch\leq sv+r$ $c(DS-v)\leq s(DC-h)\leq c(DS-v)+r$ $-s(DS-v)\leq c(DC-h)\leq -s(DS-v)+r$ There are a total of 12 inequalities here. Our goal is to find the smallest $r$ such that there are $c,s,h,v$ satisfying all these 12 inequalities.

22,A remarkable fact about the unit circle; looking for a shape with an even more remarkable fact.,A remarkable fact about the unit circle; looking for a shape with an even more remarkable fact.,,"You may have heard of the following remarkable fact about the unit circle: If $n$ equally spaced points are drawn on a unit circle, and line segments are drawn from one of the points to each of the other points, then the product of the lengths of these $n-1$ line segments, equals $n$ ( proof ). This made me wonder, does there exist a shape such that the same kind of product is not equal to $n$ , but rather a constant? That is: Does there exist a two dimensional shape (not necessarily convex) and a fixed point on its perimeter, such that, if $n$ equally spaced (in terms of distance along the perimeter) points, one of which is the fixed point, are drawn on the perimeter, and line segments are drawn from the fixed point to each of the other points, then the product $P(n)$ of the lengths of these $n-1$ line segments, is constant for all $n$ ? Ellipse? Suppose that the shape in question could be the ellipse $\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1$ , where $a$ and $b$ are positive, and the fixed point is on an axis of the ellipse, say $Q(0,-b)$ . We have $P(2)=P(4)\implies 2b=2b(a^2+b^2)\implies a^2=1-b^2$ . So the equation of the ellipse is $\frac{x^2}{1-b^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1$ , or $y=\pm b\sqrt{1-\frac{x^2}{1-b^2}}$ . For $n=8$ , suppose the point $A$ on the ellipse in the first quadrant, and the point $B$ on the ellipse in the fourth quadrant, have $x$ -coordinate $s$ . We have $P(8)=P(4)\implies AQ^2BQ^2=1$ . That is, $$\left(s^2+b^2\left(\sqrt{1-\frac{s^2}{1-b^2}}+1\right)^2\right)\left(s^2+b^2\left(\sqrt{1-\frac{s^2}{1-b^2}}-1\right)^2\right)=1$$ Here is the graph of $b$ against $s$ . According to the graph, $b\ge 1$ , so $a^2=1-b^2\le 0$ , so there is no ellipse. Sine curves? I also considered the graph $y=\pm a\sin\left(\frac{x}{a}\right), 0\le x\le a\pi$ , with fixed point $(0,0)$ . Numerical investigation suggests that there exists a constant $C\approx 0.7571$ such that, as $n\to\infty$ , If $a<C$ then $P(n)\to 0$ . If $a=C$ then $\dfrac{P(n)}{n}\to L\approx1.07$ .

48,Fascinating induction problem with numerous interpretations,Fascinating induction problem with numerous interpretations,,"Problem: Suppose you begin with a pile of $n$ stones and split this pile into $n$ piles of one stone each by successively splitting a pile of stones into two smaller piles. Each time you split a pile, multiply the number of stones in each of the two smaller piles you form, so that if these piles have $r$ and $s$ stones in them, respectively, you compute $rs$. Once you have finished splitting the piles, calculate the sum of the products computed at each step. Does the order of how you split the piles effect the final summation? Simple strong induction proof: It looks as if the sum will always be $n(n-1)/2$. Briefly, the pile of $n$ stones is split into piles of $r$ and $s=n-r$ stones, where $r$ is a positive integer less than $n$. The key inductive step for the strong induction proof is $$ rs+\frac{r(r-1)}{2}+\frac{s(s-1)}{2}=\frac{(r+s)(r+s-1)}{2}=\frac{n(n-1)}{2}. $$ My question: Are there any neat ways to interpret this problem and its solution? This problem appears in several sources where the result is often included and you are asked to prove it using induction. I noticed that there are a number of ways to view this problem and its concomitant analogues (but I am lacking a good, intuitive geometric interpretation or analysis): Combinatorics: Instead of summing the products for all of the pile splittings for $n$ stones, label the stones $1$ through $n$ and let them be elements of a set $M$. For every split, pair all of the stones in the first set with all of the stones in the second set. Every pair produced in this way appears exactly once during the activity. The terms in the sum are the number of new pairs generated after every split. Consider the power set $\mathcal{P}(M)$. By making such pairings, we have generated all distinct 2-element subsets of $\mathcal{P}(M)$. Graph theory: Instead of summing the products for all of the pile splittings for $n$ stones, scatter the stones on a flat surface. Mathematically speaking, let $P_1,P_2,\ldots,P_n$ be $n$ points in a plane where no three points are collinear. Each point represents a stone or vertex. With this understanding, the situation may be modeled by a simple graph $G=(V,E)$.

56,Succinct Proof: All Pentagons Are Star Shaped,Succinct Proof: All Pentagons Are Star Shaped,,"Question: What is a succinct proof that all pentagons are star shaped? In case the term star shaped (or star convex ) is unfamiliar or forgotten: Definition Reminder: A subset $X$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is star shaped if there exists an $x \in X$ such that the line segment from $x$ to any point in $X$ is contained in $X$. This topic has arisen in the past in my class discussions around interior angle sums; specifically, for star shaped polygons in $\mathbb{R}^2$ we can find their sum of interior angles as follows: By assumption, there is an interior point $x$ that can be connected to each of the $n$ vertices. Drawing in these line segments, we construct $n$ triangles; summing across all of their interior angles gives a total of $180n^\circ$, but this over-counts the angle sum for the polygon by the $360^\circ$ around $x$. Therefore, the sum of interior angles is $(180n - 360)^\circ = 180(n-2)^\circ$. This formula for the sum of interior angles holds more generally (often shown by triangulating polygons) but the proof strategy above already fails for some (obviously concave) hexagons. For example: The above depicted polygon is not star shaped. Moreover, it is a fact that any polygon with five or fewer sides is star shaped. And so I re-paste: Question: What is a succinct proof that all pentagons are star shaped?

This topic has arisen in the past in my class discussions around interior angle sums; specifically, for star shaped polygons in $\mathbb{R}^2$ we can find their sum of interior angles as follows: By assumption, there is an interior point $x$ that can be connected to each of the $n$ vertices. Drawing in these line segments, we construct $n$ triangles; summing across all of their interior angles gives a total of $180n^\circ$, but this over-counts the angle sum for the polygon by the $360^\circ$ around $x$. Therefore, the sum of interior angles is $(180n - 360)^\circ = 180(n-2)^\circ$. This formula for the sum of interior angles holds more generally (often shown by triangulating polygons) but the proof strategy above already fails for some (obviously concave) hexagons. For example: The above depicted polygon is not star shaped. Moreover, it is a fact that any polygon with five or fewer sides is star shaped. And so I re-paste: Question: What is a succinct proof that all pentagons are star shaped?

For simplicity, let us neglect the width of the sword, and take it to be the image of a continuous mapping  $[0,1]\to {\Bbb R}^3$.

If we let the curvature go to zero, we get the special case of a straight segment, which can be of any length: It seems to me that if one had a sword which was a helical segment, it would go into a matching scabbard.

For example if we know the area of rectangle, we can the area formula of parallelogram, then triangle and so on. That brings us to the question how to prove that the area of the square with side $a$ is $a^2$. I just came upon ProofWiki article ( http://www.proofwiki.org/wiki/Area_of_Parallelogram/Rectangle ), which showed me to get the area of rectangle from that of the square, which completes the rest of the link. But the square? I see that for such a basic figure we need some axioms to get our foot down. One that I think is absolutely essential that that of a square of $1$ units has an area of $1$ unit square, from which we can generalize to bigger squares. Another I think which we used in the rectangle proof that, if a figure $A$ is divided into different pieces then the area of $A$ is the sum of the area of the different pieces. So my first question: what set of axioms are needed that best and unambiguously describe the area of figures? Anyway, the one informal proof we are show in primary schools, that divided for example a $5 \cdot5 $ square into $25$ pieces of $1$ cm$^2$ (intuitively very plausible) fails to convince me. Somehow, we may generalize it to rational numbers, but what if the side is $\pi$? We cannot keep dividing it infinitely many times. So the second question: How do we using the axioms find the area of the square? And is there any gap, when we move forward, for example with the rectangle?

I just came upon ProofWiki article ( http://www.proofwiki.org/wiki/Area_of_Parallelogram/Rectangle ), which showed me to get the area of rectangle from that of the square, which completes the rest of the link. But the square? I see that for such a basic figure we need some axioms to get our foot down. One that I think is absolutely essential that that of a square of $1$ units has an area of $1$ unit square, from which we can generalize to bigger squares. Another I think which we used in the rectangle proof that, if a figure $A$ is divided into different pieces then the area of $A$ is the sum of the area of the different pieces. So my first question: what set of axioms are needed that best and unambiguously describe the area of figures? Anyway, the one informal proof we are show in primary schools, that divided for example a $5 \cdot5 $ square into $25$ pieces of $1$ cm$^2$ (intuitively very plausible) fails to convince me. Somehow, we may generalize it to rational numbers, but what if the side is $\pi$? We cannot keep dividing it infinitely many times. So the second question: How do we using the axioms find the area of the square? And is there any gap, when we move forward, for example with the rectangle? Thanks.",,"['geometry', 'area']"
70,Intuition why a combined inscribed and circumscribed polygon converge faster to $\pi$?,Intuition why a combined inscribed and circumscribed polygon converge faster to ?,\pi,"I was playing around a little with approximating $\pi$ by calculating the perimeter of a regular polygon both inscribing and circumscribing a circle. When using trigonometry then it can be shown that $\pi$ can be approximated using the perimeters of these polygons with $n$ sides as follows $$ \pi_i(n) = n\,\sin\left(\frac{180^\circ}{n}\right), $$ $$ \pi_c(n) = n\,\tan\left(\frac{180^\circ}{n}\right), $$ with $\pi_i(n)$ and $\pi_c(n)$ the approximation of $\pi$ from an inscribing and circumscribing polygon respectively. But $\pi_i(n)$ and $\pi_c(n)$ are always a lower and upper bound respectively for $\pi$. Therefore I thought that taking the average should give a better result, which indeed reduced the error. However the rate at which the error gets smaller as $n$ increases was the same as the previous two. When I started using different weights I found the following expression gives the best result $$ \pi_w(n) = \frac23\,\pi_i(n) + \frac13\,\pi_c(n). $$ Graphing the errors of these approximations gives: The rate at which the error of $\pi_i(n)$ and $\pi_c(n)$ goes down seems to be proportional to $n^{-2}$, while the rate at which the error of $\pi_w(n)$ goes down seems to be proportional to $n^{-4}$.
