So if A were to be the King of Spades, but B were the Queen of diamonds, that pair would not be counted along with the other lonesome King card that should've been with the King of Spades.

7,Induced path of length $\sqrt{\log n}$ in a sparse random graph,Induced path of length  in a sparse random graph,\sqrt{\log n},"I'm trying to solve Exercise 1.4.2 in this book. Here $G_{n,p}$ is a random graph on $n$ vertices where each edge is present independently with probability $p$. Suppose that $p=d/n$ where $d>1$. Show that w.h.p. $G_{n,p}$ contains   an induced path of length $\sqrt{\log n}$. The only technique for such problems introduced in the book at the point is the second moment method, so I tried that. Recall this method uses the inequality $$P(X=0)\le \frac{\operatorname{Var X}}{(\mathbb E X)^2}.$$ So, if $X$ counts the number of induced paths of length $\sqrt{\log n}$, and we show that the square of its expectation dominates its variance, we're set. Write $X = \sum_{i\in K} I_i$, where $K$ is the set of possible paths and $I_i$ is an indicator function for the presence of the induced path. We compute $$|K| = \frac{1}{2} \frac{n!}{(n - \sqrt{\log n})!}$$ and the probability of each $I_i$ occurring is $$\mathbb E I_i =p^{\sqrt{\log n}}(1-p)^{\binom{\sqrt{\log n}}{2} - \sqrt{\log n}}.$$ The $(1-p)$ factor tends to a constant, and we get asymptotically that the first moment of $X$ is $\mathbb E X= d^{\sqrt{\log n}}$, which explains why the problem requires $d>1$. However, it seems that the variance won't be small enough to give the result. Since all the $I_i$ are positively correlated, we can get a lower bound by asking what happens in the case where all the $I_i$ are independent. Recall the variance of a binomial variable (such as $I_i$) with expectation $a$ is $a(1-a),$ and here $a$ is $o(1)$ so we get that the variance is approximately $a|K|$. Then $$ \frac{\operatorname{Var X}}{(\mathbb E X)^2} \approx \frac{ |K| a (1-a)}{|K|^2 a^2} \approx \frac{1}{K|a|} = \frac{1}{\mathbb E X}.$$ So ignoring all correlations, we would just barely get the result, since $\mathbb EX$ grows slowly. However, since it grows so slowly, it seems trying to account for all the correlations will inevitably spoil the proof by making the variance too large. Am I on the right track here? Or is another method needed? I'm also curious why $\sqrt{\log n}$ works but something larger like $\log{n}$ doesn't. This restriction doesn't come out of the above calculations.","I'm trying to solve Exercise 1.4.2 in this book.

Made corrections to my initial solution. Solution : let  $A_{i}$ -multiset of size $i$ of all possible ice cream portions    customer can order ($i\in \{1,2,3,4,5\}$). Consider computation of $|A_{i}|$, except $|A_{1}|$, which is trivially equal to 7,  by the use of ""stars & bars ""method. There are 8 bars for, $i$ stars, giving directly combinations with repetitions size $i$ from the set consisting of $7+i-1 = 6 + i$ elements. Hence: $|A_{i}| ={{6+i}\choose{i}} = \frac{(6+i)!}{i! 6!} $. Also: $ (i\neq j) \implies A_{i} \cap A_{j}=\emptyset$. The rule of sum implies: number |S| of all possible orders is: $|S|=|\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{5}A_{i}|=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{5} |A_{i}| =\sum\limits_{i=1}^{5}\frac{(6+i)!}{i!6!}=\frac{7!}{1!6!} + \frac{8!}{2!6!} + \frac{9!}{3!6!} + \frac{10!}{4!6!} + \frac{11!}{5!6!} = 7 + 28+\frac{9 \times 8 \times 7}{3\times2} + \frac{10\times9\times8\times7}{4\times3\times2} + \frac{11\times10\times9\times8\times7}{5\times4\times3\times2}=7+28+84+210+462 = 791 $ Can anyone state whether my current solution is correct?

I am reading Classical Mathematical Logic by Richard L. Epstein, page : B. Types When we reason together, we assume that words will continue to be used in the same way. That assumption is so embedded in our use of language that it's hard to think of a word except as a type , that is, as a representative of inscriptions that look the same and utterances that sound the same. ...We will assume  that throughout any particalar discussion equiform words will have the same properties of interest to logic....Briefly, a word is a type. I don't really understand what a word is. The author says it is ""a representative of inscriptions that look the same and utterances that sound the same."" Does this mean that a word is the collection (not set?) of all equiform inscriptions and utterances that have been, are, will be, will never be, written or uttered? If I write: car, car, did I just pluck out two inscriptions from an infinite collection (cars, cars, cars...)? Is each ""cars"" distinguishable while it is in the collection? Meaning, does the collection actually look like ( , , ...) or does each inscription become distinguishable only after it has been plucked out from the collection?

33,Why am I under-counting when calculating the probability of a full house?,Why am I under-counting when calculating the probability of a full house?,,"I was trying to answer this question. Find the probability of getting a full house from a $52$ card deck. That is, find the probability of picking a pair of cards with the same rank (face value), and a triple with equal rank (different from the rank of the pair of course). My idea was this: Take one rank. The number of ways you can get a pair from a rank is $C(4, 2)$. Take another rank. The number of ways you can get a triple from that rank is $C(4, 3)$. Therefore, the number of ways you can get a full house from just $2$ ranks is $C(4, 2) \cdot C(4, 3)$. But there are $13$ different ranks, and the number of ways you can select $2$ ranks out of $13$ is $C(13, 2)$. For each of these pairs of ranks, you can have $C(4, 2) \cdot C(4, 3)$ full houses. Therefore the number of possible full houses is $C(4, 2) \cdot C(4, 3) \cdot C(13, 2)$, and the probability of selecting a full house is $\dfrac {C(4, 2) \cdot C(4, 3) \cdot C(13, 2)}{C(52, 5)} \approx 0.000720288$ However, this is way lower than the actual answer of $.00144$.

35,In how many ways can these people be arranged for a photograph?,In how many ways can these people be arranged for a photograph?,,"Jessie and Casey are getting married. In how many ways can a photographer at their wedding arrange 6 people in a row from a group of 10 people, where the spouses are among these 10 people, if both spouses must be in the picture? My Attempt We are looking at $6$ seats, and $2$ of them must be filled by the spouses. The number of ways in which we can pick 2 seats out of $6$ is $P(6, 2)$ (I think a case can be made for both permutation and combination). For each permutation of the $2$ spouses, we have $4$ seats left and $8$ people to fill them so the final answer is $P(6, 2) \cdot P(8, 4)=50400$. However, this doesn't correspond to any of the answer choices, which are $a) 9 · 8 · 7 · 6 · 5$ $b) 8 · 7 · 6 · 5$ $c) 8 · 7 · 6 · 5 · 4$ $d) 8 · 7 · 6$ I tried the same method but with combinations and it's wrong too.

59,Ackermann's function is $\mu$-recursive,Ackermann's function is -recursive,\mu,"In my book there is the following proof that Ackermann's function is $\mu$-recursive: We propose to show that Ackermann's funcition is $\mu$-recursive. The first part of the job is to devise a scheme whereby each step of an evaluation of Acerkmann's function can be represented by a single natural number. We will then show that the numbers associated with successive steps in an evaluation can be obtained from a primitive recursive function and that the result of the evaluation can be extracted by a suitably defined $\mu$-recursive function. We begin with the problem of representing evaluations numerically. Acekrmann's function is defined by three rules: Rule 1 : $A(0, y)=y+1$ Rule 2 : $A(x+1, 0)=A(x, 1)$ Rule 3 : $A(x+1, y+1)=A(x, A(x+1, y))$ Three facts are readily apparent from a study of Rules $1$ to $3$: First, each step in the evaluation of $A(x, y)$ results either in a single natural number or else in a nested expression of the form $$A(w_1, A(w_2, A(w_3, \dots A(w_{k-1}, w_k) \dots )))$$ Second, exactly one of the three rules is applicable at any given step. And third, no matter which rule applies, it must always be applied to the rightmost $A$ in the given expression-i.e., it must always be applied at the innermost level of the nest. Perhaps less obvious than these observations is the fact that the evaluation procedure just outlined must always terminate after a finite number of steps. Lemma 1 . For each choice of natural numbers $x$ and $y$, the expression $A(x, y)$ can be reduced to a single natural number by means of a finite number of applications of Rules $1$, $2$, and $3$. Let us now devise a method of representing the steps of an evaluation numerically. Remember that each step consists of an expression of the form $$A(w_1, A(w_2, \dots , A(w_{k-1}, w_k) \dots ))$$ Since the terms in such an expression are always associated to the right, most of the punctuation can be oitted without loss of information. In particular, the xression $A(w_1, A(w_2, \dots , A(w_{k-1}, w_k) \dots ))$ can b unambiguously represented by the $k$-tuple $$(w_1, \dots , w_{k-1}, w_k)$$ Thus each step in the evaluation of Ackermann's function can be described by a tuple of natural numbers. We next use a Gödel-numbering scheme to reduce the description of each step in an evaluation to a single natural number. In particular, we choose to represent the tuple $(w_1, \dots , w_k)$ by the natural number $$2^k 3^{w_1} \cdots p_k^{w_k}$$ Note the length of the tuple is encoded as the exponent of two, while the components of the tuple are encoded as the exponents of the succeding primes. This provides a single way of telling how many components to ""look for"" in a given Gödel number. This scheme allows us to describe the evaluation of Ackermann's function with a sequence of natural numbers. Such a numbering scheme is referred to as an arithmetization of the evaluation of Ackermann's function. Note that the steps of the evaluation are numbered, starting with zero, and the zeroth step correpsonds to the expression $A(x, y)$ whose value is to be determined. We now define the three-variable function $\psi$ so that $\psi(x, y, n)$ is theGödel number of the nth step in the evaluation of $A(x, y)$. In orrder to make $\psi$ a total function, we agree to ""extend"" each evaluation of Ackermann's function as follows. If the actual evaluation of $A(x, y)$ terminates at step $n_0$ and this step  is assigned the Gödel number $z$, we simply set $\psi(x,y,n)=z$ for all $n \geq n_0$. The resulting function $\psi$ will be referred to as the trace function for the evaluation of $A$. One next job is to sho wthta $\psi$ is a primitive recursive function. For this purpose it is conveninet to be able to view every natural number $z$ as being a Gödel number of some tuple. The simplest approach is to ignore any ""extra"" primes in the decomposition of $z$. Thus the natural number $$2^k3^{w_1}5^{w_2} \cdots p_k^{w_k}p_{k+1}^{w_{k+1}} \cdots p_m^{w_m}$$ will be treated as if it were the Gödel number of the $k$-tuple $(w_1, \dots , w_k)$. With this convention in mind, we now assign an auxiliary predicate and an auxiliary function to each of the rules defining Ackermann's function. For each of the values $i=1$, $i=2$, and $i=3$, lewt $Q_i$ denote the predicate such that: $$Q_i(z) \Leftrightarrow z \text{ is a Gödel number of a tuple to which Ruile } i \text{ applies }$$ And let $h_i$ denote a function such that, if $Q_i(z)$ holds, then: $$h_i(z) \text{ is the Gödel number of the tuple that results when Rule }$$ $$i \text{ is applied to the tuple represented by the number } z$$ If $Q_i(z)$ does not hold-i.e., if $z$ does not represnet a tuple to which Rule $i$ applies, the value assumed by $h_i(z)$ is unimportant. (We will in fact choose these ""default values"" so as to ensure the primitive recursiveness of $h_i$.) The predicates $Q_1, Q_2, Q_3$ and the functions $h1, h_2,h_3$ provide an easy way of specifying the trace function $\psi$. Since $\psi(x, y, 0)$ is just the Gödel number of the tuple $(x, y)$, we have: $$\psi(x, y, 0)=2^23^x5^y$$ And since $ \psi(x, y, n+1)$ can be obtained from $\psi(x, y, n)$ by determining whiich rule applies to the tuple represented by $\psi(x, y, n)$ and then computing the effect of applying that rule, we can write: $$\psi(x, y, n+1)=\begin{cases} h_1(\psi(x, y, n)) & \text{ if } Q_1(\psi(x, y, n)) \\ h_2(\psi(x, y, n)) & \text{ if } Q_2(\psi(x, y, n)) \\ h_3(\psi(x, y, n)) & \text{ if } Q_3(\psi(x, y, n)) \\ \psi(x, y, n) & \text{ otherwise} \end{cases}$$ Thus to show that $\psi$ is primitive recursive, it is only necessary to show that the predicates $Q_1, Q_2, Q_3$ and the functions $h_1, h_2, h_3$ are primtive recursive. To this end, we introduce one more auxiliary function $L$, whose values for argument $z$ is the length of the tuple represented by $z$. Since $$L(z)=E(0, z)$$ the function $L$ is certainly primitve recursive. Now, the predicate $Q_1(z)$ is to hold iff $z$ represnets a tuple containing at least two components, of which the next-to-last is zero. Thus we can write $$Q_1(z) \Leftrightarrow (L(z)>1) \wedge (E(L(z)\overset{\cdot }{-}1, z)=0)$$ Similar reasoning yields the following definitions of $Q_2$ and $Q_3$, as the reader may verify. $$Q_2(z) \Leftrightarrow (L(z)>1) \wedge (E(L(z)\overset{\cdot}{-}1, z)\neq 0) \wedge (E(L(z), z)=0) \\ Q_3(z) \Leftrightarrow (L(z)>1) \wedge (E(L(z)\overset{\cdot}{-}1, z)\neq 0)\^ (E(L(z), z) \neq 0)$$ Thus the predicates $Q_1$, $Q_2$, and $Q_3$ are all primitive recursive. The functions $h_1$, $h_2$. and $h_3$ are only slightly more difficult to deal with. First consider the case in which $z$ represents a tuple to which Rule $1$ applies. That is, suppose that the prime decomposition of $z$ has the form: $$z=2^k3^{w_1} \cdots p_{k-2}^{w_{k-2}}p_{k-1}^0p_k^{w_k} \cdots p_m^{w_m}$$ Inspection of Rule $1$ reveals that in ythis case the appropriate value of $h_1(z)$ is: $$2^{k-1}3^{w_1} \cdots p_{k-2}^{w_{k-2}}p_{k-1}^{w_{k+1}}$$ We are therefore led to define $h_1$ as follows: $$h_1(z)=2^{L(z)\overset{\cdot}{-}1} \left [ \prod_{i=1}^{L(z)\overset{\cdot}{-}2}pn(i)^{E(i, z)}\right ] pn(L(z)\overset{\cdot}{-}1)^{E(L(z), z)+1}$$ The choice of this definition ensures that $h_1$ is primitive recursive and that $h_1(z)$ assumes the required values whenever $Q_1(z)$ holds. (Rememver that it does not matter what value $h_1(z)$ assumes when $Q_1(z)$ does not hold.) Similar observations concerning Rules $2$ and $3$ lead to the following definitions of the functions $h_2$ and $h_3$. $$h_2(z)= \left [ \prod_{i=1}^{L(z)\overset{\cdot}{-}2}pn(i)^{E(i, z)}\right ] pn(L(z)\overset{\cdot}{-}1)^{E(L(z)\overset{\cdot}{-}1, z)\overset{\cdot }{-}1}pn(L(z)) \\ h_3(z)=\dots $$ Thus the desired functions $h_1$, $h_2$, and $h_3$, like the predicates $Q_1$, $Q_2$, and $Q_3$, are primitive recursive. And this in urn implies that the trace function $\psi$ is primitive rcursive. We are now ready to show that Ackermann's function is $\mu$-recursive. Fr this purpose we define the two-variable function $\eta$ so that $\eta(x, y)$ is te number of steps needed to evaluate $A(x, y)$. Evidently $\eta(x, y)$ is the smallest value of $n$ for which $\psi(x, y, n)$ represents a single natural number. Thus: $$\eta (x, y) =\mu n(L(\psi(x, y, n))=1]$$ Since $L$ and $\psi$ aare primitive recursive, it follows that $\eta$ is a $\mu$-recursive function. Next note that the outcome of the evaluation of $A(x, y)$ is just the value of the natural number represented by $\psi(x, y, \eta(x, y))$. We may therefore write $$A(x, y)=E(1, \psi(x, y, \eta (x, y)))$$ Since $E$ and $\psi$ are primitive recursive and $\eta$is $\mu$-recursive, we have the finally established: Theorem: Ackermann's function is $\mu$-recursive. $$$$ Could you explain to the idea of the proof?? I haven't understood   it... Why do we need the functions $h_i$, $\psi$, and so on to show   that Ackermann's function is $\mu$-recursive??","In my book there is the following proof that Ackermann's function is $\mu$-recursive: We propose to show that Ackermann's funcition is $\mu$-recursive.

The functions $h_1$, $h_2$. and $h_3$ are only slightly more difficult to deal with. First consider the case in which $z$ represents a tuple to which Rule $1$ applies. That is, suppose that the prime decomposition of $z$ has the form: $$z=2^k3^{w_1} \cdots p_{k-2}^{w_{k-2}}p_{k-1}^0p_k^{w_k} \cdots p_m^{w_m}$$ Inspection of Rule $1$ reveals that in ythis case the appropriate value of $h_1(z)$ is: $$2^{k-1}3^{w_1} \cdots p_{k-2}^{w_{k-2}}p_{k-1}^{w_{k+1}}$$ We are therefore led to define $h_1$ as follows: $$h_1(z)=2^{L(z)\overset{\cdot}{-}1} \left [ \prod_{i=1}^{L(z)\overset{\cdot}{-}2}pn(i)^{E(i, z)}\right ] pn(L(z)\overset{\cdot}{-}1)^{E(L(z), z)+1}$$ The choice of this definition ensures that $h_1$ is primitive recursive and that $h_1(z)$ assumes the required values whenever $Q_1(z)$ holds. (Rememver that it does not matter what value $h_1(z)$ assumes when $Q_1(z)$ does not hold.) Similar observations concerning Rules $2$ and $3$ lead to the following definitions of the functions $h_2$ and $h_3$. $$h_2(z)= \left [ \prod_{i=1}^{L(z)\overset{\cdot}{-}2}pn(i)^{E(i, z)}\right ] pn(L(z)\overset{\cdot}{-}1)^{E(L(z)\overset{\cdot}{-}1, z)\overset{\cdot }{-}1}pn(L(z)) \\ h_3(z)=\dots $$ Thus the desired functions $h_1$, $h_2$, and $h_3$, like the predicates $Q_1$, $Q_2$, and $Q_3$, are primitive recursive. And this in urn implies that the trace function $\psi$ is primitive rcursive. We are now ready to show that Ackermann's function is $\mu$-recursive. Fr this purpose we define the two-variable function $\eta$ so that $\eta(x, y)$ is te number of steps needed to evaluate $A(x, y)$. Evidently $\eta(x, y)$ is the smallest value of $n$ for which $\psi(x, y, n)$ represents a single natural number. Thus: $$\eta (x, y) =\mu n(L(\psi(x, y, n))=1]$$ Since $L$ and $\psi$ aare primitive recursive, it follows that $\eta$ is a $\mu$-recursive function. Next note that the outcome of the evaluation of $A(x, y)$ is just the value of the natural number represented by $\psi(x, y, \eta(x, y))$. We may therefore write $$A(x, y)=E(1, \psi(x, y, \eta (x, y)))$$ Since $E$ and $\psi$ are primitive recursive and $\eta$is $\mu$-recursive, we have the finally established: Theorem: Ackermann's function is $\mu$-recursive. $$$$ Could you explain to the idea of the proof?? I haven't understood   it... Why do we need the functions $h_i$, $\psi$, and so on to show   that Ackermann's function is $\mu$-recursive??",,"['discrete-mathematics', 'computability', 'recursion', 'ackermann-function']"

This is how I did it: First i tried to find the functions which are not onto case 1: All in A maps to a single element of B There are 3 ways for this case2: When mappings are made for only two elements in range.

(If so, that's really easy) On the other hand, does it want me to generalize the proof? 2. If two digits are changed in a valid UPC, the new code may or may not be valid. Determine the type of changes to two digits that result in a valid code, and determine the change to two digits that result in a code that is not valid. Justify both of your answers.
