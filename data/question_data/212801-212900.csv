I apologize if it goes against any guidelines for posting. I study math as a hobby and am currently dealing with trigonometry on a high school level. I have so far learned the formulas for trigonometric addition and subtraction and double the angle, as well as what is in my language referred to as the ’trigonometric one’ - getting the radius of the unit circle by use of the pythagorean theorem. I have not yet gotten to deriving trigonometric functions. The following is a problem I could solve by plugging in a set of numbers, but in seeking a more elegant solution, perhaps, I found myself stuck and I don’t know what I am missing. I am appreciative of any help I get. The problem is as follows: Show that if $A$ is an angle and $0^\circ<A<90^\circ$ then $\hspace{0.3cm}\left( 1+\dfrac {1}{\sin A}\right) \left( 1+\dfrac {1}{\cos A}\right)>5$ I began with the following assumption: $$0^\circ<A<90^\circ\rightarrow0<{\sin A}<1\\0<{\cos A}<1\rightarrow\dfrac {1}{\sin A}\\\dfrac {1}{\cos A}>1$$ Given the above, it would follow that: $$\begin{aligned} \lim _{A\rightarrow 90^\circ}\dfrac {1}{\cos A}&=\infty \\ \lim _{A\rightarrow 0^\circ}\dfrac {1}{\sin A}&=\infty \end{aligned}$$ This alone doesn’t seem like enough to show what is asked. I can show that at $A=45^\circ$ the product is still greater than 5, but I am not sure how any offset in degrees from there affects two trigonometric terms such that the product is still greater than 5.

The following is a problem I could solve by plugging in a set of numbers, but in seeking a more elegant solution, perhaps, I found myself stuck and I don’t know what I am missing. I am appreciative of any help I get. The problem is as follows: Show that if $A$ is an angle and $0^\circ<A<90^\circ$ then $\hspace{0.3cm}\left( 1+\dfrac {1}{\sin A}\right) \left( 1+\dfrac {1}{\cos A}\right)>5$ I began with the following assumption: $$0^\circ<A<90^\circ\rightarrow0<{\sin A}<1\\0<{\cos A}<1\rightarrow\dfrac {1}{\sin A}\\\dfrac {1}{\cos A}>1$$ Given the above, it would follow that: $$\begin{aligned} \lim _{A\rightarrow 90^\circ}\dfrac {1}{\cos A}&=\infty \\ \lim _{A\rightarrow 0^\circ}\dfrac {1}{\sin A}&=\infty \end{aligned}$$ This alone doesn’t seem like enough to show what is asked. I can show that at $A=45^\circ$ the product is still greater than 5, but I am not sure how any offset in degrees from there affects two trigonometric terms such that the product is still greater than 5. I also tried solving the inequality but ended up with fractioned terms I couldn’t add up or a cubic function if you will, that I couldn’t solve.",,['trigonometry']

Somewhere in middle school (pre-algebra, pre-geometry), things started to click. I don't want to suggest I was a math genius by any stretch, but I found that if I was keeping up conceptually with one module, the intro into the next had a nice ""Oh, yes, of course! That is the next logical step!"" feeling, so that I got to be the obnoxious kid who rolled his eyes at anyone struggling with a specific concept, thinking that it was so obvious that if we already know that the volume of a cylinder is the area of the circle on top times the height, why wouldn't a cone be one-third of that? As I continued through high school, things got trickier, but overall either things made sense, or eventually made sense if I carefully retraced my steps to see where I got lost, and occasionally, things made no damn sense until there was an awesome pop in my head, like realizing that matrices weren't really crazy and magical, they were just a way of lining up all of the variables in such a way that they could be easily dealt with all at once. Then we got to trigonometry functions. I basically bowed out at this point, took some honorably low B and C grades, knowing I just wasn't getting something, and never took any formal math classes ever again. Two things I've learned since then: You aren't really borrowing or carrying any one's, it's just a handy way of treating the top number as 10 + itself. Unless you are taking math classes in college meant for math majors, you always use a calculator to get the actual numbers when figuring sine, cosine, and tangent. That second part is crucial to my question. 20 years after hitting this math wall, I find out that it's not just easier to use a calculator for these functions, it's pretty much required (unless you've got your grandfather's slide rule, but this is basically the same idea, look it up). So my questions are: Are the trigonometric functions inherently something you just accept and learn and find a place in your brain for so that further concepts derive intuitively from that starting point, or do these concepts derive in a clear and somewhat intuitive (or at least straightforward) way from lower-level concepts that I've managed to not quite fit together on every 3-5 year skimming I attempt on the topic? I'm sure, since there are those who can actually provide proofs or calculate the functions without a calculator, that these functions were not just ""found"" or ""dreamt of"" or were the ramblings of one insane genius who could only provide the ratios, not the reasoning. So I get that they are arrived at from lower-level math. So what I really want to know is if my struggle to understand it the same way I had come to understand every other math concept is basically where I'm going wrong, like my long overdue discovery that calculators were essential to the process. (really sub 2) - If it really is just ""hard"" or ""learned"" or ""work"", I can accept that. Learning Latin verbs was hard and I knew I was getting low marks because I wasn't doing the work.

If you try to approximate $\pi$ by fractions of the form $180n/(360k+1)$, you can find that $\pi \approx \frac{7920}{2521}$.  And this is pretty close: the continued fraction expansion of $\pi$ is $(3; 7,15,1,292,\ldots)$, and the continued fraction for the approximation is $(3;7,16,4,2,2)$. However, if you switched out 360 for dividing the circle into $r$ pieces, you are looking for approximations of $\pi$ of the form $rn / 2(rk+1)$ as $n$ and $k$ vary. Is this particular approximation for $\pi$ you get, based on 360 degrees, unusually close for the size ($n=44$, $k=7$) present? I feel like I have to tell a story to justify this question, because otherwise it's a little weird -- please bear with me. Some time (a long time) ago, I was in a programming class for grade-school kids and we were learning to do some basic graphics.  We were drawing fireworks, and encountered the problem that the ""bursts"" seemed to have their points going off in random directions.  You can guess why: the standard library functions for sin and cos were expecting radians instead of degrees. Our teacher told us that there was some conversion factor, but didn't remember it.  So I set the computer on a loop to draw lines out from the center of a circle, to see if I could figure out what the conversion factor was.  It animated drawing lines at angles of 1 radian, 2 radians, 3 radians, ... 360 radians, and then cleared the screen and started over drawing lines at 2 radians, 4 radians, 6 radians ... and then again drawing at 3 radians, 6 radians, 9 radians, ... Of course, this was kind of misguided, but it was interesting to watch for a few minutes.  (If I was more motivated, I would try and animate it again, but those skills are very rusty.)  And then, at the multiples of 44 radians, it suddenly worked: it visibly drew a nice, sweeping path all the way around the circle in one pass. I tweaked around with it a little and found that while (cos(360*44),sin(360*44)) were pretty close to (1,0), a better approximation was had if you used about 43.99975 instead.

92,Generalization of the law of tangents for a cyclic quadrilateral,Generalization of the law of tangents for a cyclic quadrilateral,,"The law of tangents is a statement about the relationship between the tangents of two angles of a triangle and the lengths of the opposing sides. Let $a$ , $b$ , and $c$ be the lengths of the three sides of a triangle, and $\alpha$ , $\beta$ and $\gamma$ be the angles opposite those three respective sides. The law of tangents states that $$\frac{\tan\frac12(\alpha-\beta)}{\tan\frac12(\alpha+\beta)}=\frac{a-b}{a+b}\tag{1}$$ The law of tangent can be used in any case where two sides and the included angle, or two angles and a side, are known. Although Viète gave us the modern version of the law of tangents, it was Fincke who stated the law of tangents for the first time and also demonstrated its application by solving a triangle when two sides and the included angle are given (see Wu - The Story of Mollweide and Some Trigonometric Identities ) A proof of the law of tangent is provided by Wikipedia (see here ). Generalization . Let $a$ , $b$ , $c$ and $d$ be the sides of a cyclic convex quadrilateral. Let $\angle{DAB}=\alpha$ and $\angle{ABC}=\beta$ , then the following identity holds $$\frac{\tan\frac12(\alpha-\beta)}{\tan\frac12(\alpha+\beta)}=\frac{(a-c)(b-d)}{(a+c)(b+d)}\tag{2}$$ Proof . Using the sum-to-product formulas we can rewrite the left-hand side of $(2)$ as follows $$\frac{\tan\frac12(\alpha-\beta)}{\tan\frac12(\alpha+\beta)}=\frac{\sin\frac12(\alpha-\beta)\cos\frac12(\alpha+\beta)}{\cos\frac12(\alpha-\beta)\sin\frac12(\alpha+\beta)}=\frac{\sin{\alpha}-\sin{\beta}}{\sin{\alpha}+\sin{\beta}}.$$ The area of a cyclic quadrilateral can be expressed as $\Delta=\frac12(ad+bc)\sin{\alpha}$ (see $(12)$ at Killing three birds with one stone ) and similarly for the other angles. Then substituting, simplifying and factorizing we have $$\begin{align*}\frac{\tan\frac12(\alpha-\beta)}{\tan\frac12(\alpha+\beta)}&=\frac{\frac{2\Delta}{ad+bc}-\frac{2\Delta}{ab+cd}}{\frac{2\Delta}{ad+bc}+\frac{2\Delta}{ab+cd}}=\frac{ab-ad+cd-bc}{ab+ad+cd+bc}=\frac{(a-c)(b-d)}{(a+c)(b+d)}\end{align*}.$$ $\square$ The formula $(2)$ reduces to the law of tangent for a triangle when $c=0$ .
