(Attempt) Let $f(z) = \displaystyle\frac{\log(1/2+z+z^2)}{1+z^2}$ . Its poles are $z \in \left\{i,-i\right\}$ and its branch points are $\displaystyle z \in \left\{-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{i}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}-\frac{i}{2}\right\}$ . For simplicity's sake, let $\displaystyle z_a = -\frac{1}{2}+\frac{i}{2}$ and $\displaystyle z_b = -\frac{1}{2}-\frac{i}{2}$ . With these, we can rewrite $f(z)$ as $$ \begin{align} \frac{\log\left(\frac{1}{2}+z+z^{2}\right)}{1+z^{2}} &= \frac{\log\left(\left(z-z_{a}\right)\left(z-z_{b}\right)\right)}{1+z^{2}} \\ &= \frac{1}{1+z^{2}}\left(\log\left(\left|z-z_{a}\right|\cdot\left|z-z_{b}\right|\right)+i\operatorname{arg}\left(\left(z-z_{a}\right)\left(z-z_{b}\right)\right)\right) \\ &= \frac{1}{1+z^{2}}\left(\log\left|z-z_{a}\right|+\log\left|z-z_{b}\right|+i\operatorname{arg}\left(z-z_{a}\right)+i\operatorname{arg}\left(z-z_{b}\right)\right). \end{align} $$ But for the equalities to hold, define $\displaystyle \operatorname{arg}(z-z_a) \in \left(\frac{3\pi}{4},\frac{11\pi}{4}\right)$ and $\displaystyle \operatorname{arg}(z-z_b) \in \left(-\frac{11\pi}{4},-\frac{3\pi}{4}\right)$ . Here is a visual of the keyhole contour.

As $R \to \infty$ and $r \to 0$ , it can be proved that $\displaystyle \int_{\Gamma}f(z)dz$ and $\displaystyle \int_{\gamma}f(z)dz$ go to $0$ . For the contour integrals over $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ , let them approach the branch cut $\Lambda$ .

More formally: $\lim_{n \to \infty }\frac{a_n}{\sqrt{n}} = \sqrt{2}$ (if there's no mistake below), what can we say about $\frac{a_n}{\sqrt{n}} - \sqrt{2}$ , e.g. does $\lim_{n \to \infty} (a_n - \sqrt{2n})$ exist and can we find it in an explicit form? From direct computation in Python it follows (see above) that $$\text{Hypothesis:} \quad \lim_{n \to \infty} (a_n - \sqrt{2n}) = 0$$ is true. What is obvious? It's easy to see that $a_n$ is strictly increasing and tends to $\infty$ (Indeed, otherwise $a_n$ is bounded and hence $a_n \to a < \infty$ . Thus $a = \lim a_{n+1} = \lim (a_n +\frac{1}{a_n}) = a +\frac{1}{a} \Longrightarrow a = a+\frac{1}{a}$ ). What else do we know? If I'm not mistaken $\big[\sqrt{2n+\frac94} - \frac12\big] \le a_n \le \sqrt{2n}(1+o(1))$ for all $n > 2$ (the proof is above) and hence $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_n}{\sqrt{n}} = \sqrt{2}$ . Some numerical experiments are presented in the end of the question. What are the difficulties? The upper bound for $a_n$ was obtained using the asymptotics of the sums $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{[f(n)]}$$ where $f(n) = \sqrt{2n+\frac94} - \frac12$ and $[x]$ is an integer part of $[x]$ . There are good estimates (using intergal approximation) of $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{f(n)}$ for good functions $f$ , but it looks like there are no good estimates of $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{[f(n)]}$ . Proofs: Lemma1. $a_n \ge \sqrt{2n+\frac94} - \frac12$ if $n = \frac{k(k+1)}2-1 \ge 2$ . Proof. Lets prove that $a_{\frac{k(k+1)}2 - 1} \ge k$ for $k \ge 2$ .  Put $m_k = \frac{k(k+1)}2-1$ . We will use induction and suppose the opposite. We have: $a_{m_k} \ge k$ and $a_{m_{k+1}} < k+1$ . Hence $$ k \le a_{m_k} < a_{m_k + 1 } < a_{m_k + 2 } < \ldots < a_{m_{k+1}} < k+1,$$ $$ a_{m_k+i+1} - a_{m_k+i} = \frac{1}{a_{m_k+i}} > \frac{1}{k+1}$$ Summing l.h.s. or the last inequality we get $$ a_{m_{k+1}} - a_{m_{k}}  > \frac{1}{k+1} + \frac{1}{k+1} + \ldots +  \frac{1}{k+1} = \frac{m_{k+1}-m_k}{k+1}.$$ But $a_{m_{k+1}} - a_{m_{k}} < (k+1)- k = 1$ . Thus $$ 1 > \frac{m_{k+1}-m_k}{k+1} \Longrightarrow m_{k+1}-m_k < k+1 \Longrightarrow \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}2 - \frac{k(k+1)}2 < k+1 \Longrightarrow $$ $$ \Longrightarrow \frac{(k+2)}2 - \frac{k}2 < 1 \Longrightarrow 1 < 1.$$ We got a contradiction. Thus $a_{m_{k+1}} \ge k+1$ . Lemma is proved. Lemma2 : $a_n \ge \big[\sqrt{2n+\frac94} - \frac12\big]$ for all $n \ge 2$ . Proof. Put $u_n = \big[\sqrt{2n+\frac94} - \frac12\big]$ . We have $$ u_n \le \sqrt{2n+\frac94} - \frac12 \Longrightarrow  (u_n + \frac12)^2 \le 2n+\frac94 \Longrightarrow n \ge \frac{u_n(u_n+1)}{2}-1 $$ Thus $$ a_n \ge a_{\frac{u_n(u_n+1)}{2}-1} \ge u_n$$ by lemma 1. Lemma3: $\frac{a_n}{\sqrt{n}} \to \sqrt{2}$ as $n\to \infty$ . Proof. According to lemma 2 it's sufficient to show that $\overline{\lim}_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_n}{\sqrt{n}} \le  \sqrt{2}$ . Put $u_n =  \big[\sqrt{2n+\frac94} - \frac12\big]$ . We have $$ a_{j+1} - a_j = \frac1{a_j} \le \frac{1}{u_j}$$ It follows that $$ a_n = \sum_{j=3}^{n-1} (a_{j+1}-a_j) + a_2 \le 2 + \sum_{j=3}^{n-1} \frac{1}{u_j}$$ As $u_j \sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{2j}}$ hence $$\sum_{j=3}^{n-1} \frac{1}{u_j} \sim \sum_{j=1}^{n} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2j}} \sim \int_{1}^n \frac{dx}{\sqrt{2x}} \sim \sqrt{2n}.$$ Thus $\overline{\lim}_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_n}{\sqrt{n}} \le  \sqrt{2}$ .

Then maybe we may get properties of $a_n$ from the solution $y(t) = \sqrt{2t + c}$ if we estimate the precision of approximation of ODE by our linear recurrence relation.

If you think that idea with is useful please give a hint how to bring this idea to mind."," a_1 = 1 a_{n+1} = a_n +\frac{1}{a_n} \frac{a_n}{\sqrt{n}} \frac{a_n}{\sqrt{n}} \lim_{n \to \infty }\frac{a_n}{\sqrt{n}} = \sqrt{2} \frac{a_n}{\sqrt{n}} - \sqrt{2} \lim_{n \to \infty} (a_n - \sqrt{2n}) \text{Hypothesis:} \quad \lim_{n \to \infty} (a_n - \sqrt{2n}) = 0 a_n \infty a_n a_n \to a < \infty a = \lim a_{n+1} = \lim (a_n +\frac{1}{a_n}) = a +\frac{1}{a} \Longrightarrow a = a+\frac{1}{a} \big[\sqrt{2n+\frac94} - \frac12\big] \le a_n \le \sqrt{2n}(1+o(1)) n > 2 \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_n}{\sqrt{n}} = \sqrt{2} a_n \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{[f(n)]} f(n) = \sqrt{2n+\frac94} - \frac12 [x] [x] \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{f(n)} f \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{[f(n)]} a_n \ge \sqrt{2n+\frac94} - \frac12 n = \frac{k(k+1)}2-1 \ge 2 a_{\frac{k(k+1)}2 - 1} \ge k k \ge 2 m_k = \frac{k(k+1)}2-1 a_{m_k} \ge k a_{m_{k+1}} < k+1  k \le a_{m_k} < a_{m_k + 1 } < a_{m_k + 2 } < \ldots < a_{m_{k+1}} < k+1,  a_{m_k+i+1} - a_{m_k+i} = \frac{1}{a_{m_k+i}} > \frac{1}{k+1}  a_{m_{k+1}} - a_{m_{k}}  > \frac{1}{k+1} + \frac{1}{k+1} + \ldots +  \frac{1}{k+1} = \frac{m_{k+1}-m_k}{k+1}. a_{m_{k+1}} - a_{m_{k}} < (k+1)- k = 1  1 > \frac{m_{k+1}-m_k}{k+1} \Longrightarrow m_{k+1}-m_k < k+1 \Longrightarrow \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}2 - \frac{k(k+1)}2 < k+1 \Longrightarrow   \Longrightarrow \frac{(k+2)}2 - \frac{k}2 < 1 \Longrightarrow 1 < 1. a_{m_{k+1}} \ge k+1 a_n \ge \big[\sqrt{2n+\frac94} - \frac12\big] n \ge 2 u_n = \big[\sqrt{2n+\frac94} - \frac12\big]  u_n \le \sqrt{2n+\frac94} - \frac12 \Longrightarrow  (u_n + \frac12)^2 \le 2n+\frac94 \Longrightarrow n \ge \frac{u_n(u_n+1)}{2}-1   a_n \ge a_{\frac{u_n(u_n+1)}{2}-1} \ge u_n \frac{a_n}{\sqrt{n}} \to \sqrt{2} n\to \infty \overline{\lim}_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_n}{\sqrt{n}} \le  \sqrt{2} u_n =  \big[\sqrt{2n+\frac94} - \frac12\big]  a_{j+1} - a_j = \frac1{a_j} \le \frac{1}{u_j}  a_n = \sum_{j=3}^{n-1} (a_{j+1}-a_j) + a_2 \le 2 + \sum_{j=3}^{n-1} \frac{1}{u_j} u_j \sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{2j}} \sum_{j=3}^{n-1} \frac{1}{u_j} \sim \sum_{j=1}^{n} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2j}} \sim \int_{1}^n \frac{dx}{\sqrt{2x}} \sim \sqrt{2n}. \overline{\lim}_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_n}{\sqrt{n}} \le  \sqrt{2} b_n = a_n - \sqrt{2n} n b_{1000}=0.035513542064180115,

92,Is There a Difference Between $d^2x$ and $(dx)^2$?,Is There a Difference Between  and ?,d^2x (dx)^2,"I've just started reading through Calculus Made Easy by Silvanus Thompson and am trying to solidify the concept of differentials in my mind before progressing too far through the text. In Chapter 1 Thompson describes a differential $dx$ as ""a little bit of $x$"" or ""an element of $x$"" and then proceeds to describe $\int dx$ as ""the sum of all the little bits of $x$."" I'm okay upto this point. In Chapter 2 he begins discussing the various degrees of ""smallness"" and this is where I begin to lose track. At times his explanation seems to make sense, and then again it does not. Thompson starts his discussion of degrees of smallness with an appeal to time. Obviously 1 minute is a very small quantity of time compared with a   whole week. Indeed, our forefathers considered it small as compared   with an hour, and called it ""one minute,"" meaning a minute fraction -   namely one sixtieth - of an hour. When they came to require still   smaller subdivisions of time, they divided each minute into 60 still   smaller parts, which, in Queen Elizabeth's days, they called ""second   minutes"" (i.e. small quantities of the second order of minuteness). Now, at this time it seems as though Thompson is making the point that $(dx)^2$ may be considered to be ""a little bit of $dx$"" or ""a little bit of a little bit of $x$,"" which seems intuitive, but perhaps not consistent with the language. However, a little later he describes $(dx)^2$ as ""a little bit of a little bit of $x^2$. And in doing so, he backs up his statement with a figure of a square with sides of length $x + dx$ and notes that any one of the corners of the square represents the magnitude $(dx)^2$. While not necessarily appealing to my intuition, this description does seem to be more in line with his description of $dx$. a little bit $\cdot$ $x$ $\cdot$ a little bit $\cdot$ $x$ $=$ a little bit $\cdot$ a little bit $\cdot$ $x^2$ Yet, I don't see how this second description is making the case for $(dx)^2$ being any less significant than $dx$. From the diagram, it actually seems more significant than $dx$, being $dx$ times greater than $dx$. So I'm wondering, is there a difference between $d^2x$ and $(dx)^2$? Should I read $d^2x$ as ""a little bit of a little bit of $x$"" and $(dx)^2$ as ""a little bit of a little bit of $x^2$?"" Am I missing the point entirely? Have I gone completely mad? In hopes of further clarifying the question, I'm including a little more of what Thompson said: If $dx$ be a small bit of $x$, and relatively small of itself, it does   not follow that such quantities as $x \cdot dx$, or $x^2 \cdot dx$, or   $a^x \cdot dx$ are negligible. But $dx \cdot dx$ would be negligible,   being a small quantity of the second order. Furthermore, he states: [I]n all cases we are justified in neglecting the small quantities of the second - or third (or higher) - orders , if only we take the   small quantity of the first order small enough in itself.","I've just started reading through Calculus Made Easy by Silvanus Thompson and am trying to solidify the concept of differentials in my mind before progressing too far through the text. In Chapter 1 Thompson describes a differential $dx$ as ""a little bit of $x$"" or ""an element of $x$"" and then proceeds to describe $\int dx$ as ""the sum of all the little bits of $x$."" I'm okay upto this point. In Chapter 2 he begins discussing the various degrees of ""smallness"" and this is where I begin to lose track. At times his explanation seems to make sense, and then again it does not. Thompson starts his discussion of degrees of smallness with an appeal to time. Obviously 1 minute is a very small quantity of time compared with a   whole week. Indeed, our forefathers considered it small as compared   with an hour, and called it ""one minute,"" meaning a minute fraction -   namely one sixtieth - of an hour. When they came to require still   smaller subdivisions of time, they divided each minute into 60 still   smaller parts, which, in Queen Elizabeth's days, they called ""second   minutes"" (i.e. small quantities of the second order of minuteness). Now, at this time it seems as though Thompson is making the point that $(dx)^2$ may be considered to be ""a little bit of $dx$"" or ""a little bit of a little bit of $x$,"" which seems intuitive, but perhaps not consistent with the language. However, a little later he describes $(dx)^2$ as ""a little bit of a little bit of $x^2$.
