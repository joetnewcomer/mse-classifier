0,Can a group be fully characterised by its Sylow $p$-subgroups? [duplicate],Can a group be fully characterised by its Sylow -subgroups? [duplicate],p,"This question already has an answer here : Does the order, lattice of subgroups, and lattice of factor groups, uniquely determine a group up to isomorphism? (1 answer) Closed last month . I was wondering if we have two groups, $G$ , $H$ , such that $|G| = |H|$ (and these orders are finite); and all their Sylow $p$ -subgroups have the same structure (i.e. Syl $_p(G)$ isomorphic to Syl $_p(H)$ for all $p$ ) and each Sylow $p$ -subgroup has an equal number of conjugates in $G$ and $H$ , then can it ever be such that $G$ is not isomorphic to $H$ ? My instinct on this is no, though it is hard to find examples of relatively small groups where it would be applicable. I asked the Group Theory lecturer in my maths department and they suspected there are such $G$ and $H$ , but did not give an example and only cited that ""group classification would be much easier if so"", so I was wondering if somebody here could provide either a proof that $G$ and $H$ must be isomorphic, or a counterexample?","This question already has an answer here : Does the order, lattice of subgroups, and lattice of factor groups, uniquely determine a group up to isomorphism?

Further it is stated in the literature that this map is also an homeomorphism. See for exmaple Conway, A course in functional analysis Theorem 9.11. I am trying to prove this result. While proving the continuity is straightforward, i am stuck proving that the inverse is continous. One should note that $ \Bbb{R}$ is equipped with the standard topology and $\hat{\Bbb{R}}$ with the topology induced by compact convergence. That means a function converges iff it converges unfirom on every compact subset. I tried some ways, none of wich was promising. I am grateful for any hint on how to do this. Edit 2: I have found a proof based on non trivial results as seen below. However i am still interested if this can be proven more direct without the help of said results. Edit 1: The proof that the map is bijective is often done in the following way: One shows that $\gamma \in \hat{\Bbb{R}}$ fullfills this differential equation: $$ \left\{ \begin{array}{cl} 	\gamma'(x) &= \gamma'(0) \gamma(x) \\ 	\gamma(0) &= 1\\ 	\end{array}\right. $$ with the condition $| \gamma(x)| = 1 $ for all $x \in \Bbb{R}$.

My friend associated each force vector with a complex root of unity, and using the fact that the group of the $N$-roots of unity is cyclic, showed the identity: $$1 + \zeta + \zeta^2 + \cdots + \zeta^{n-1} = 0$$ which equals saying that the resultant force is zero.

Here are the statement and the proof (translated from Polish). I believe there must be some mistakes in it, only I don't know how many. I'm changing nothing in the symbols used. Let $H_i$ be subgroups of $G$. Then $$G=\bigcup_{i=1}^{n}\bigcup_{j=1}^{n_i}H_ia_{ij}\implies\exists_i[G:H_i]<\infty.$$ And the proof is this: By induction over $n.$ For $n=1$ it is clear because $$G=\sum_{j=1}^{n_i}Ha_{ij},$$ and so $[G:H_1]\leq n_1.$ Now the step. Let $[G:H_n]=\infty.$ There exists a coset $H_ng$ which is contained in $$\bigcup_{i=1}^{n-1}\bigcup_{j=1}^{n_i}H_ia_{ij},$$ and so $$H_na_{n_j}\subset \bigcup_{i=1}^{n-1}\bigcup_{j=1}^{n_i}H_ia_{ij}g^{-1}a_{n_j}.$$ We treat the element $a_{ij}g^{-1}a_{n_j}$ as $b_{i,j,t},$ where $t$ corresponds to the pair $(n,j).$ Therefore $$\bigcup_{j=1}^{n_n}H_n a_{n_j}\subset\bigcup_{i=1}^{n-1}\bigcup_{j=1}^{n_t}H_ib_{ijt}. $$ Therefore $$G\subset\bigcup_{i=1}^{n-1}\bigcup_{j=1}^{s}H_ib_{ij},$$ and the inductive hypothesis gives us that one of these cosets has a finite index.

Here’s the version that we use in our class. van Kampen's Theorem . Suppose we have an open cover $\left\{U_{\alpha}: \alpha \in A\right\}$ of $\left(X, x_{0}\right)$ by path-connected open sets $U_{\alpha} \ni x_{0}$ containing the basepoint. As above, let $F:= \ast_{\alpha} \pi_{1}\left(U_{\alpha}\right)$ be the free product and $\varphi: F \rightarrow \pi_{1}(X)$ be the map induced by the inclusions. Also let $K \triangleleft F$ be the normal subgroup generated by the words $i_{\alpha \beta}(\sigma) i_{\beta \alpha}(\sigma)^{-1}$ for $\sigma \in \pi_{1}\left(U_{\alpha} \cap U_{\beta}\right) .$ Then since $K<\operatorname{ker} \varphi$ as explained above, we get a map $\bar{\varphi}: F / K \rightarrow \pi_{1}(X)$ . If $U_{\alpha} \cap U_{\beta}$ is path-connected for all $\alpha, \beta \in A$ , then $\bar{\varphi}$ (or equivalently $\varphi$ ) is surjective. If furthermore $U_{\alpha} \cap U_{\beta} \cap U_{\gamma}$ is path-connected for all $\alpha, \beta, \gamma \in A$ , then $\bar{\varphi}$ is injective, thus an isomorphism $F / K \cong \pi_{1}(X).$ The accompanying diagram is as follows: What is not clear to me is what happens, under $\bar{\varphi}$ (or $\varphi$ ), to the loops in $X$ that is not in $U_\alpha \cap U_\beta$ . For example, let $X$ be covered by $U_\alpha$ , $U_\beta$ , and a “weird” (but still path-connected) $U_\gamma$ . The loop in red (let’s call it $\lambda$ ) is in $\pi_1(X)$ , and it has a corresponding element $a_\gamma^j$ in $F$ , where $a_\gamma$ is a generator of $\pi_1(U_\gamma)$ . Under the projection $p: F \to F/K$ , it is sent to the coset $a_\gamma^jK$ of $K$ in $F$ . I’m inclined to think that $a_\gamma^j$ “gets its own coset” under $p$ , as do other loops not in $\pi_1(U_\alpha \cap U_\beta)$ (if any), since they have nothing to do with $K$ . Is there anything else we know about $a_\gamma^jK$ in this setting? What would its elements look like? Also, the reason for this question is that when the theorem was introduced, I got the impression that the diagram would somehow give a complete picture of $\pi_1(X)$ . But it seems like that is not the case, or at least some elements of $\pi_1(X)$ would not be described as precisely as others with this diagram. Would a remedy be that, instead of considering $F$ modulo just $K$ , we take $F$ modulo all such normal subgroups over all pairs of covering sets, i.e. $F/\kappa$ , where $\kappa$ is the normal subgroup of $F$ generated by all the $K_1,K_2,\dots,K_t$ ?","I’ve just read the set up and the statement for van Kampen’s theorem.

I'm under the impression there are theorems which hold for all groups which may be easy to prove for Abelian groups and hard to prove for non-Abelian groups. My intuition is that commutativity gives you a lot (at least when bundled with closure and associativity) and it might be tricky to prove something right at the edge of ""things which are true for non-Abelian groups"" if you could use commutativity as a shortcut. I'm not sure how well-founded this intuition, but clearly there are things which are common to all groups and things which are different between Abelian and non-Abelian groups; it's just whether one can use assumptions of commutativity instead of taking a longer path without it. Binary relations are stronger than $n$ -ary relations as the binary relations can imply the $n$ -ary relations. For instance sets resulting from a Cayley-Dickson construction have power-associativity, which is much weaker than binary associativity because it only applies to $x^n$ rather than for products of distinct elements with $n$ -many repetitions, or even that all products of $n$ -many terms are associative but products of $(n-1)$ -many terms are not necessarily so. To me power-associativity resembles a form of idempotency, however clearly in these algebras $x^n \neq x$ . There may be some very interesting structures only possible with $n$ -ary relations rather than binary relations, however my understanding is that if an algebra is pairwise commutative and tri-wise associative then it's also tri-wise commutative (we can permute $ABC$ however we like and preserve the result.

Even more, could we think of the family $m_G$ (indexed by the class of groups) as a natural transformation of some or other functors? Let's call our mystery categories $\mathcal A$ and $\mathcal B$ with mystery functors $X,Y :\mathcal A\to\mathcal B$ such that the natural transformation condition holds: $$ m_HX(f) = Y(f)m_G $$ where $f$ is a morphism in $\mathcal A$ and $G,H$ are groups. For this to make sense, we need a category with objects $G\times G$ and $G$ . So, we extend (?) the category of groups by $\mathcal B_0 := \mbox{Grp}_0 \cup \{G\times G \mid G\in\mbox{Grp}_0\}$ . Morphisms in 'separate components' remain as they are in $\mbox{Grp}$ and $\mbox{Grp}\times\mbox{Grp}$ respectively.

During each round, you'll trade k times and each time you need to give your current paper to someone who has never had it, and you need to receive a paper that you've never had. There are n papers.    For example, if everyone passes their paper to the left, then you can trade $n-1$ times, and on the $n$th trade everyone gets their papers back.  Clearly $k < n$ no matter how you trade. It is suboptimal for one player to always trade with the same player, so we want to use different permutations each time.  When writing a webpage to choose permutations randomly, I ran into a theoretical problem: if we don't know k , can we still generate a good sequence of shuffles? As long as any good sequence of shuffles can be extended to a maximal sequence, we are ok. For n ≤ 6 this is true.  Is it true in general? For n a positive integer, call a sequence of permutations $g_i \in S_n$ deranged if $\prod_{i=a}^b g_i$ has no fixed points on $\{1,\dots,n\}$ for any $1 \leq a\leq b \leq k$, where $k$ is the length of the sequence. Must every maximal deranged sequence have $k=n-1$? A deranged sequence of length 1 is just called a derangement .

Hence a deranged sequence $g_1, \dots, g_k\in S_n$ is maximal iff for every $g_{k+1} \in S_n$, the sequence $g_1, \dots, g_k, g_{k+1}$ is not deranged. Examples: In order to make the problem more symmetrical, it can be helpful to append $g_{k+1} = (g_1 \cdots g_k)^{-1}$ to the sequence.  This corresponds to a final step of ""handing everyone back their original paper."" Then every consecutive $k-1$ subsequence of every cyclic permutation has the property that it is deranged.  Thus these deranged ""cycles"" of length $k+1$ are acted on both by $S_n$ (relabeling the people) and by $C_{k+1}$ (cyclic permutations).  This can help reduce the number of truly distinct examples.

My idea - first of all, I cannot use the Lie algebra-lie group correspondence as we've yet to learn it. First I proved that every $1-1$ homomorphism of the circle group must be the identity or the inverse map. So it's left for me to prove that given such homomorphism $\phi$ , it's kernel is the roots of unity of order $n$ for some $n\in\mathbb{N}$ . My attempt: Firstly, since $\ker(\phi)\subset\mathbb{S}^1$ is a closed subgroup, it is also a closed Lie subgroup. Assuming $\phi$ is not the trivial homomorphism, it is not both closed and open (as $\mathbb{S}^1$ is connected), and therefore must be $0$ -dimensional submanifold (as $\mathbb{S}^1$ is one dimensional) - and consequently has the discrete topology. So $\ker(\phi)$ is a discrete subset of a compact set and hence finite.

88,Identification of ends of Bruhat-Tits Tree,Identification of ends of Bruhat-Tits Tree,,"I am trying to understand why a canonical identification exists between the ""ends"" or ""rays"" of the Bruhat-Tits tree defined on $\mathbb{Z}_p$ -lattices (with metric invariant under the action of $PGL(2,\mathbb{Q}_p)$ ) and $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{Q}_p)=\mathbb{Q}_p\cup\{\infty\}$ . I have consulted several online references on the Bruhat-Tits tree, all of which more or less avoid constructing the actual identification. Intuitively, I see that since any vertex in the tree has $p+1$ neighbors, a path that travels outwards without backtracking should correspond to a $p$ -adic number - for instance, if $p=2$ , you could label a path and end up with some binary string such as $0101010011...$ , which can be converted into a $2$ -adic by using the 0s and 1s as coefficients of a formal Laurent series. I am unsure, however, of what the end that corresponds to $\infty$ should look like, as well as how the exact identification between a path and a $p$ -adic would work - given a binary string, for instance, how would we know which power of $p$ would be the starting point? I am also unsure of what the implications of there being $p+1$ choices for the first outgoing edge are.

I have consulted several online references on the Bruhat-Tits tree, all of which more or less avoid constructing the actual identification. Intuitively, I see that since any vertex in the tree has neighbors, a path that travels outwards without backtracking should correspond to a -adic number - for instance, if , you could label a path and end up with some binary string such as , which can be converted into a -adic by using the 0s and 1s as coefficients of a formal Laurent series. I am unsure, however, of what the end that corresponds to should look like, as well as how the exact identification between a path and a -adic would work - given a binary string, for instance, how would we know which power of would be the starting point?

One direction of the above is straightforward. Given that $S$ is a group with additive identity $0_S,$ consider an ideal $I$ of $S.$ Given any element $i \in I,$ by hypothesis that $S$ is a group, we have that $-i \in S.$ Consequently, we have that $$s = s + 0_S = s + (-i + i) = (s + (-i)) + i$$ is an element of $S + I.$ By assumption that $I$ is an ideal of $S,$ we have that $S + I \subseteq I,$ from which it follows that $s \in I.$ We conclude therefore that $S \subseteq I.$ Evidently, the reverse containment holds, so we find that $I = S.$ But this says precisely that the only ideal of $S$ is $S$ itself. Unfortunately, however, I am unable to prove the converse, i.e., I cannot show that if the only ideal of $S$ is $S$ itself, then $S$ is a group. Of course, there are many different equivalent conditions to show that a semigroup is a group, but my initial thought is that I could show that $S$ has an additive identity $0_S$ and additive inverses $-s$ for each of its elements. I have tried for a while to use the fact that for any nonempty subset $J$ of $S,$ we have that $J \cup (S + J)$ is an ideal of $S.$ Explicitly, I tried to show by way of contradiction that the set $I = \{s \in S \,|\, \forall t \in S, \, s + t = t \}$ is nonempty, but I got tied up in the negation, and I could not come up with a nonempty set $J$ such that $J \cup (S + J)$ is an ideal -- in which case, I could use the fact that $J \cup (S + J) = S.$ I would greatly appreciate any advice or assistance.

94,Orders of Elements in Symmetric Groups,Orders of Elements in Symmetric Groups,,"We define the symmetric group $S_n$ to be the set of all permutations of the first $n$ natural numbers. Moreover, we define the set $T_n$ as the set of all possible orders of elements in $S_n$ i.e. $$T_n=\{ \space|\sigma| \mid \sigma \in S_n \}$$ We are interested in studying the set $T_n$ . First, we can start by observing when $x \in T_n$ , given positive integers $x$ and $n$ . Clearly, $x=1$ is an element of $T_n$ for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$ since the identity permutation has order $1$ . For $x>1$ , let the prime factorization of $x$ be: $$x=\prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{a_i}$$ Assume that a permutation $\sigma \in S_n$ has order $x$ . Let the unique cycle decomposition (with cycles of length $1$ ignored) of $\sigma$ be: $$\sigma=\prod_{j=1}^t C_j$$ We have $x=|\sigma|=\text{lcm}(|C_1|,|C_2|,\ldots,|C_t|)$ . Using this equation, we can show that for every $1 \leqslant i \leqslant k$ , there exists some $1 \leqslant j \leqslant t$ such that $p_i^{a_i} \mid |C_j|$ . This implies that $p_i^{a_i} \leqslant |C_j|$ . Moreover, if we have multiple prime powers, say $p_1^{a_1}, p_2^{a_2}, \ldots ,p_i^{a_i}$ (WLOG a list of $i$ prime powers) all dividing $|C_j|$ , we can see that: $$p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\cdots p_i^{a_i} \mid |C_j| \implies p_1^{a_1}+p_2^{a_2}+\cdots+p_i^{a_i} < p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\cdots p_i^{a_i} \leqslant |C_j|$$ This tells us that: $$\sum_{i=1}^k p_i^{a_i} \leqslant \sum_{j=1}^t |C_j| \leqslant n \implies \sum_{i=1}^k p_i^{a_i} \leqslant n$$ However, one can see that this is a sufficient condition for the existence of a permutation $\sigma$ as we can set $k=t$ and $|C_i|=p_i^{a_i}$ for all $1 \leqslant i \leqslant k$ . Thus: $$x \in T_n \iff \sum_{i=1}^k p_i^{a_i} \leqslant n$$ We can see that the sum of the prime powers in the factorization of numbers is relevant in studying $T_n$ . Thus, we define: $$f \bigg( \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{a_i} \bigg) = \sum_{i=1}^k p_i^{a_i}$$ One result we can deduce using this function is showing that the only exception to $|T_n|>|T_{n-1}|$ for $n>2$ is $n=6$ . Clearly, we can see from above that: $$|T_n|>|T_{n-1}| \iff \exists \space x \in \mathbb{N} \text{ such that } f(x)=n$$ We can check that $n=1,6$ are the only exceptions till $n<11$ . For $n \geqslant 11$ , we prove by induction hypothesis. We assume that $1$ and $6$ are the only exceptions until $n-1$ . As $11$ is the second Ramanujam prime, we have: $$\pi(n)-\pi \bigg(\frac{n}{2} \bigg) \geqslant 2$$ So, let two primes in the interval $\bigg(\frac{n}{2},n \bigg]$ be $p$ and $q$ . Clearly, $n-p$ and $n-q$ are not simultaneously $1$ and $6$ due to parity. WLOG, let $n-p \neq 1,6$ . We have: $$f(x)=n-p \implies f(px)=n$$ Note that $p \nmid x$ as $p>n-p$ . Thus, we have concluded that $|T_n|>|T_{n-1}|$ for $n>2, n\neq6$ . We can see that the observation of $f(x)$ gives us better insight on the set $T_n$ .

For example, $\mathrm U(2)$ itself is not fixed-point free, as $$T:=\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\ \phantom+0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}\in \mathrm U(2)\setminus\{\mathrm{Id}\}$$ has the fixed point $(0,1)\in\Bbb C^2$ . I know that $\mathrm{SU}(2)\subset\mathrm U(2)$ is fixed point free (it acts like the multiplicative group of unit quaternions on $\Bbb H\cong\Bbb C^2$ ). It is also maximal, since it acts regularly on the unit sphere $\Bbb S^1(\Bbb C)\subset\Bbb C^2$ .  There are also the conjugates of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ . But are there any others? Update Thanks to the enlightening answer by YCor, I understand that the problem in this form seems to be intractable. By that answer I also realized that what I am more interested in are those maximal fixed-point free subgroups that have ""interesting"" finite subgroups, that is, other than, say, $\{\mathrm{Id}\}$ and $\{\pm\mathrm{Id}\}$ . Or also, closed subgroups (in the topological sense). YCor's answer already established that besides $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ we have the maximal torus $\mathrm U(1)\times\mathrm U(1)$ as another maximal subgroup. Both are closed and have ""interesting"" finite subgroups.","Let be the group of unitary -matrices. I wonder the following: Question: What are the maximal fixed-point free subgroups of ?

99,Examples of proper group actions,Examples of proper group actions,,"Lately I encountered the definition of proper group: A $G$ -action on $X$ is called proper if the function $f:(g,x)\mapsto (g\cdot x, x)$ is proper, i.e. for any compact set $U\subset X\times X$ , the preimage $f^{-1}(U)$ is compact. But I have no clue how to check this on concrete examples. For example consider $\mathbb Z \times \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ , $(n,x)\mapsto x+n$ . Its clear that for any $n\in \mathbb Z$ , $n^{-1}\cdot[0,1]=[-1,1]$ and so $$f^{-1}([0,1]) = \bigcup_{n\in \mathbb Z} \{n\}\times [-n,-n+1],$$ but this is still an infinite union of compact sets. Also, even if I show this, it does not really help me. It's not like in the case of continuity that it suffices to consider balls. Another example which should be easy to check is the action of $GL(V)$ on the vector space $V$ , (for symplicity $V = \mathbb R^2$ ). So here is my question: Could you provide me with some examples of proper discontinuous group actions and most importantly how to check this property ? Edit: The first answer is based on the Poincare Polyhedron Theorem which looks very useful. However, i would also like to see a more direct approach worling with the definitions.","Lately I encountered the definition of proper group: A -action on is called proper if the function is proper, i.e. for any compact set , the preimage is compact.
