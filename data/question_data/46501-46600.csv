In case not there are two questions at the bottom, one of which I don't know the answer to. Throughout all this $T$ will  be a $2\times 2$ real matrix. First, context - my work so far: I recently posted an answer to a question about $T$, where I essentially proved this: If $T^3=I$ then $T=I$ or $T^2+T+I=0$. First version: Note that $t^3-1=(t-1)(t-\alpha)(t-\overline\alpha)$, where $\alpha=e^{2\pi i/3}$. Note that the minimal polynomial has degree no larger than $2$. Bringing in complex numbers seems like cheating. Second version: Note that $t^3-1=(t-1)(t^2+t+1)$. Since $t^2+t+1$ is irreducible the minimal polynomial must be $t-1$ or $t^2+t+1$. Was happier with that. Then I realized that I'd implicitly used the fact that $\mathbb R[t]$ is a UFD. Wasn't too hard to verify that. (Why not just open a book? The only things I feel I really understand or ever remember are things I've worked out for myself.) What I'd shown was this: If $R$ is a PID and every element of $R$ is a product of irreducibles then $R$ is a UFD. It's clear that every polynomial is a product or irreducibles, so $\mathbb R[t]$ is a UFD. But this finally reminded me of something from an algebra class years ago: Of course every PID is a UFD. Was stuck for a bit showing that in a PID every element is a product of irreducibles. Realized I needed to show ACC. Mentioned this to a guy at the office, and he said that in fact A ring satisfies ACC if and only if every ideal is finitely generated. (So in particular every PID has ACC, finishing the proof that every PID is a UFD.) He said he didn't recall the proof. In fact it's more or less obvious: Say $I$ is an ideal which is not finitely generated. Let $x_1\in I$. We can recursively choose $x_n\in I$ so $x_{n+1}\notin<x_1,\dots,x_n>$, and there's your ascending chain of ideals. Conversely, say every ideal is finitely generated, and suppose $I_1\subset I_2\dots$ is a chain of ideals. Let $I=\bigcup I_n$. If $g_1,\dots,g_n$ generate $I$ there exists $N$ with $g_1,\dots, g_n\in I_N$. Hence $I=I_N$. Finally the questions. First the fun one: Question 1. Saying every ideal is countably generated is equivalent to what ACC-ish condition? (The answer will be immediately obvious to various readers. If you're one of them please give the kids a chance to try to figure it out.) And a question I don't know the answer to: Question 2. Say $T$ is a $2\times 2$ real matrix and $T^2+T+I=0$. That is, $T$ has eigenvalues $\alpha$ and $\overline\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is as above, so $T$ is $\mathbb C$-diagonalizable. Does it follow that $T$ is $\mathbb R$-similar to a rotation by $\pm 2\pi/3$? I can't imagine what else $T$ could be, but I haven't proved it.

33,Cohen-Macaulay and connected implies equidimensional?,Cohen-Macaulay and connected implies equidimensional?,,"I'm asking for a reality check. It seems to me that since Cohen-Macaulay rings are locally equidimensional, such a ring is either equidimensional or else disconnected (with different dimensions occurring on different connected components). But I have not slept enough, so I don't trust my reasoning. Is it sound? Addendum: Having given this more (and better-slept) thought, it is not at all clear to me. I know that a local Cohen-Macaulay ring is equidimensional, in other words, all minimal primes have the same dimension. (E.g. Eisenbud, Commutative Algebra with a View Toward Algebraic Geometry , Corollary 18.11.) ( Edit 2/24/17: The following proof is flawed. See second addendum.) It follows from this that for an arbitrary (noetherian) Cohen-Macaulay ring $R$, if $\operatorname{Spec} R$ is connected, then all the minimal primes $\mathfrak{p}$ have the same dimension. I.e. $\dim R/\mathfrak{p}$ does not depend on $\mathfrak{p}$. Proof: two minimal primes of differing dimension cannot be contained in the same maximal, by localizing at that maximal and applying the result for local rings. Therefore, sort the minimal primes according to dimension. There are only finitely many minimal primes, so finitely many classes containing finitely many primes each, and one can build a partition of $\operatorname{Spec} R$ into finitely many disjoint closed sets corresponding to the classes in this way. Connectedness implies there is only one class, thus all minimal primes have the same dimension. Geometrically, this is the statement that the irreducible components of $R$ are all the same dimension. But I thought equidimensionality also meant that the maximals all have the same height. Here, I don't see the argument. Imagine one maximal that covers all the minimals with height $1$, say, and another maximal that lies above all the minimals with height $2$, with a lot of height 1 primes in between. This yields a connected $\operatorname{Spec}$ since a single closed set containing all the minimal primes will be everything, but if two different closed sets each contain a minimal prime, then they overlap at the maximals. This scenario is not ruled out by any property I can think of possessed by the poset of primes of a Cohen-Macaulay ring: it is catenary (since it is a ranked poset, ranked by height); the minimals are all dimension 2; etc. But yet I see numerous references on the internet to the notion that Cohen-Macaulay rings are equidimensional (sometimes without even a connected assumption, which can't be right; e.g. $k\times k[x]$ is Cohen-Macaulay). E.g. here . Perhaps they mean the local case? Or are using a weaker notion of equidimensionality? Second addendum, 2/24/17: I am no longer convinced by the above argument that the minimal primes in a Cohen-Macaulay ring with a connected spectrum must have the same dimension. It is the case that the minimal primes under a given maximal have the same-length saturated chains to that maximal , but it doesn't follow that they have the same dimension: perhaps one of them is also under another maximal with a greater height, while the other is not. On the other hand: if the Cohen-Macaulay ring with the connected spectrum happens to be integral over an equidimensional Cohen-Macaulay subring (which is guaranteed, e.g. for finite-type $k$-algebras by Noether normalization, per conv. with MooS below her/his answer), then I have convinced myself it is equidimensional. Here is why I think so: Let the Cohen-Macaulay ring be $R$ and let the equidimensional Cohen-Macaulay subring be $S$; say its dimension is $d$. Since $S$ is Cohen-Macaulay, the result quoted above for local rings, together with the fact that Cohen-Macaulay rings are catenary, implies that the lengths of any two saturated chains of primes from a given maximal to two minimals under it are equal. Since $S$ is equidimensional, this common length must be $d$ for every maximal. Thus, the length of any saturated chain between any minimal prime and any maximal is $d$. It follows from a second application of catenaryness that for any prime ideal of $S$, and any saturated chain from a minimal to a maximal containing this prime, the position of this prime in this chain depends only on the prime and not on the chain. Now consider any saturated chain of primes between a minimal prime $\mathfrak{p}$ and a maximal $\mathfrak{m}$ in $R$. Say its length is $\ell$. Intersecting with $S$, one obtains a chain of primes, and due to integrality, it has the following three properties: (1) it is saturated; (2) its ""top end"" is a maximal; (3) it is length $\ell$. (1) and (2) are due to going-up and (3) is due to incomparability . ( Edit 2/24/17: I'm no loger convinced going-up implies (1). Grr! See third addendum.) Let the $h(\mathfrak{p})$ be the height of $\mathfrak{p}\cap S$ in $S$. By the above discussion, $h(\mathfrak{p}) = d - \ell$; thus $\ell$ doesn't depend on $\mathfrak{m}$ or the choice of chain, but only on $\mathfrak{p}$. Connectedness of the spectrum (at least for noetherian rings) is equivalent to connectedness of the bipartite graph with vertex classes the minimal and maximal primes, and edges indicating containment. (Proof: two closed sets $V(\mathfrak{p}), V(\mathfrak{q})$ of the spectrum, where $\mathfrak{p},\mathfrak{q}$ are minimal primes, meet iff there is a maximal containing both $\mathfrak{p},\mathfrak{q}$. So if the graph is disconnected, there is a partition of these finitely many closed sets $V(\text{minimal prime})$, which cover the spectrum, into disjoint classes, and this disconnects the spectrum. Conversely, if the spectrum is disconnected, there are two disjoint nonempty closed sets; they must both meet the minimal primes and contain everything above the ones they meet, and then the way they partition the minimal primes also partitions the graph.) Thus, between any two minimal primes $\mathfrak{p},\mathfrak{q}$, there is a path in the graph $$\mathfrak{p} = \mathfrak{p}_1 \subset \mathfrak{m}_1\supset \mathfrak{p}_2\subset \mathfrak{m}_2\supset \dots\subset\mathfrak{m}_r\supset \mathfrak{p}_{r+1} = \mathfrak{q}$$ Because $R$ is Cohen-Macaulay, by the same logic as for $S$ above (i.e. by localizing at $\mathfrak{m}_i$) we conclude that the lengths $\ell_i$ and $\ell_i'$ of saturated chains between $\mathfrak{m}_i$, and $\mathfrak{p}_i$ and $\mathfrak{p}_{i+1}$ respectively, are equal, for each $i$. Thus $h(\mathfrak{p}_i)$ and $h(\mathfrak{p}_{i+1})$ are equal. And thus $h(\mathfrak{p})$ and $h(\mathfrak{q})$ are equal. Thus $h$ is a constant function on the minimal primes of $R$. Now take any minimal prime of $S$. By lying-over, there is some prime of $R$, say $\mathfrak{p}^*$, lying over it, which must be minimal by incomparability, and we have $h(\mathfrak{p}^*)=0$. Therefore, $h$ is identically zero on the minimal primes of $R$. Thus for any saturated chain in $R$ from a minimal $\mathfrak{p}$ to a maximal $\mathfrak{m}$, of length $\ell$, we have $0=h(\mathfrak{p}) = d - \ell$, and we conclude $\ell=d$. Therefore, all maximals have height $d$ and all minimals have dimension $d$, i.e. $R$ is equidimensional of dimension $d$. Third addendum, 2/24/17: There is a soft spot in the proof of the second addendum as well. I found another unjustified assumption I made probably due to being overly familiar with the good behavior of the coordinate rings of varieties. Going-up doesn't imply by itself that the intersection of a saturated chain in $R$ with $S$ yields a saturated chain in $S$, although it may well be true in the present context for other reasons. I asked a followup question on this point here . Fourth addendum, 2/26/17: Given the track record at this point, there's no reason to expect me not to find another mistake; however, I believe I have proven this variant of the statement in the second addendum: If a Cohen-Macaulay ring has a connected spectrum and is finite (strengthened from integral) over a subring that is an integrally closed, equidimensional, catenary noetherian domain, then it is equidimensional. This OP is already too long without me adding another detailed proof, but it very loosely follows the pattern of the argument in the 2nd addendum, i.e. argues that all maximal chains in $S$ have length $d$ and then shows $h(\mathfrak{p})=0$ using connectedness. Here is a reasonably complete outline: I. Show all maximal chains in $S$ have the same length $d$ using equidimensionality + catenariness. II. Consider the set $W_0$ of primes of $R$ whose intersection with $S$ is zero. (a) They are all minimal and dimension $d$. (b) Fixing one of them $\mathfrak{p}$, and a target maximal $\mathfrak{m}$ containing it, construct a chain of length $d$ to $\mathfrak{m}$ by (b1) passing temporarily to $R/\mathfrak{p}$ which is a domain containing $S$; then passing to their fraction fields; then forming normal closure of $\operatorname{Frac}(R/\mathfrak{p}) /\operatorname{Frac}S$ and taking $S$'s integral closure $B$ in it; (b2) invoking going-up to construct a chain of length $d$ in $B$ with top term lying over $\mathfrak{m}\cap S$, and and lying-over to find another prime in $B$ lying over $\mathfrak{m}$; (b3) using a Galois automorphism to move the chain til its top term is the prime we found lying over $\mathfrak{m}$; (b4) intersecting with $R$ yielding the desired chain. (c) By Cohen-Macaulayness, a maximal $\mathfrak{m}$ of $R$ that contains one of the $\mathfrak{p}$'s in $W_0$ (and is therefore height $d$) can't also contain a minimal prime $\mathfrak{q}$ with $h(\mathfrak{q}) >0$. Thus if there are any such minimal primes, the graph described in the 2nd addendum is disconnected. This contradicts the fact that the spectrum of $R$ is connected, so there are no such primes. Therefore all minimals are in $W_0$, so are dimension $d$ by (a), and all maximals contain one of these, so are height $d$ by (b). Conclude equidimensionality. Fifth addendum, 3/13/17: Fourth addendum holds up I believe, but argument in (b) can be simplified by replacing the Galois theory just by passing to $R/\mathfrak{p}$ and then invoking the going-down theorem for $S\subset R/\mathfrak{p}$.","I'm asking for a reality check. It seems to me that since Cohen-Macaulay rings are locally equidimensional, such a ring is either equidimensional or else disconnected (with different dimensions occurring on different connected components). But I have not slept enough, so I don't trust my reasoning. Is it sound? Addendum: Having given this more (and better-slept) thought, it is not at all clear to me. I know that a local Cohen-Macaulay ring is equidimensional, in other words, all minimal primes have the same dimension. (E.g. Eisenbud, Commutative Algebra with a View Toward Algebraic Geometry , Corollary 18.11.) ( Edit 2/24/17: The following proof is flawed. See second addendum.) It follows from this that for an arbitrary (noetherian) Cohen-Macaulay ring $R$, if $\operatorname{Spec} R$ is connected, then all the minimal primes $\mathfrak{p}$ have the same dimension. I.e. $\dim R/\mathfrak{p}$ does not depend on $\mathfrak{p}$. Proof: two minimal primes of differing dimension cannot be contained in the same maximal, by localizing at that maximal and applying the result for local rings. Therefore, sort the minimal primes according to dimension. There are only finitely many minimal primes, so finitely many classes containing finitely many primes each, and one can build a partition of $\operatorname{Spec} R$ into finitely many disjoint closed sets corresponding to the classes in this way. Connectedness implies there is only one class, thus all minimal primes have the same dimension. Geometrically, this is the statement that the irreducible components of $R$ are all the same dimension. But I thought equidimensionality also meant that the maximals all have the same height. Here, I don't see the argument. Imagine one maximal that covers all the minimals with height $1$, say, and another maximal that lies above all the minimals with height $2$, with a lot of height 1 primes in between. This yields a connected $\operatorname{Spec}$ since a single closed set containing all the minimal primes will be everything, but if two different closed sets each contain a minimal prime, then they overlap at the maximals. This scenario is not ruled out by any property I can think of possessed by the poset of primes of a Cohen-Macaulay ring: it is catenary (since it is a ranked poset, ranked by height); the minimals are all dimension 2; etc. But yet I see numerous references on the internet to the notion that Cohen-Macaulay rings are equidimensional (sometimes without even a connected assumption, which can't be right; e.g. $k\times k[x]$ is Cohen-Macaulay). E.g. here . Perhaps they mean the local case? Or are using a weaker notion of equidimensionality? Second addendum, 2/24/17: I am no longer convinced by the above argument that the minimal primes in a Cohen-Macaulay ring with a connected spectrum must have the same dimension. It is the case that the minimal primes under a given maximal have the same-length saturated chains to that maximal , but it doesn't follow that they have the same dimension: perhaps one of them is also under another maximal with a greater height, while the other is not. On the other hand: if the Cohen-Macaulay ring with the connected spectrum happens to be integral over an equidimensional Cohen-Macaulay subring (which is guaranteed, e.g. for finite-type $k$-algebras by Noether normalization, per conv. with MooS below her/his answer), then I have convinced myself it is equidimensional. Here is why I think so: Let the Cohen-Macaulay ring be $R$ and let the equidimensional Cohen-Macaulay subring be $S$; say its dimension is $d$. Since $S$ is Cohen-Macaulay, the result quoted above for local rings, together with the fact that Cohen-Macaulay rings are catenary, implies that the lengths of any two saturated chains of primes from a given maximal to two minimals under it are equal. Since $S$ is equidimensional, this common length must be $d$ for every maximal. Thus, the length of any saturated chain between any minimal prime and any maximal is $d$. It follows from a second application of catenaryness that for any prime ideal of $S$, and any saturated chain from a minimal to a maximal containing this prime, the position of this prime in this chain depends only on the prime and not on the chain. Now consider any saturated chain of primes between a minimal prime $\mathfrak{p}$ and a maximal $\mathfrak{m}$ in $R$. Say its length is $\ell$. Intersecting with $S$, one obtains a chain of primes, and due to integrality, it has the following three properties: (1) it is saturated; (2) its ""top end"" is a maximal; (3) it is length $\ell$. (1) and (2) are due to going-up and (3) is due to incomparability . ( Edit 2/24/17: I'm no loger convinced going-up implies (1). Grr! See third addendum.) Let the $h(\mathfrak{p})$ be the height of $\mathfrak{p}\cap S$ in $S$. By the above discussion, $h(\mathfrak{p}) = d - \ell$; thus $\ell$ doesn't depend on $\mathfrak{m}$ or the choice of chain, but only on $\mathfrak{p}$. Connectedness of the spectrum (at least for noetherian rings) is equivalent to connectedness of the bipartite graph with vertex classes the minimal and maximal primes, and edges indicating containment. (Proof: two closed sets $V(\mathfrak{p}), V(\mathfrak{q})$ of the spectrum, where $\mathfrak{p},\mathfrak{q}$ are minimal primes, meet iff there is a maximal containing both $\mathfrak{p},\mathfrak{q}$. So if the graph is disconnected, there is a partition of these finitely many closed sets $V(\text{minimal prime})$, which cover the spectrum, into disjoint classes, and this disconnects the spectrum. Conversely, if the spectrum is disconnected, there are two disjoint nonempty closed sets; they must both meet the minimal primes and contain everything above the ones they meet, and then the way they partition the minimal primes also partitions the graph.) Thus, between any two minimal primes $\mathfrak{p},\mathfrak{q}$, there is a path in the graph $$\mathfrak{p} = \mathfrak{p}_1 \subset \mathfrak{m}_1\supset \mathfrak{p}_2\subset \mathfrak{m}_2\supset \dots\subset\mathfrak{m}_r\supset \mathfrak{p}_{r+1} = \mathfrak{q}$$ Because $R$ is Cohen-Macaulay, by the same logic as for $S$ above (i.e. by localizing at $\mathfrak{m}_i$) we conclude that the lengths $\ell_i$ and $\ell_i'$ of saturated chains between $\mathfrak{m}_i$, and $\mathfrak{p}_i$ and $\mathfrak{p}_{i+1}$ respectively, are equal, for each $i$. Thus $h(\mathfrak{p}_i)$ and $h(\mathfrak{p}_{i+1})$ are equal. And thus $h(\mathfrak{p})$ and $h(\mathfrak{q})$ are equal. Thus $h$ is a constant function on the minimal primes of $R$. Now take any minimal prime of $S$. By lying-over, there is some prime of $R$, say $\mathfrak{p}^*$, lying over it, which must be minimal by incomparability, and we have $h(\mathfrak{p}^*)=0$. Therefore, $h$ is identically zero on the minimal primes of $R$. Thus for any saturated chain in $R$ from a minimal $\mathfrak{p}$ to a maximal $\mathfrak{m}$, of length $\ell$, we have $0=h(\mathfrak{p}) = d - \ell$, and we conclude $\ell=d$. Therefore, all maximals have height $d$ and all minimals have dimension $d$, i.e. $R$ is equidimensional of dimension $d$.

I tried to search online by I can't get a complete proof. Take $M$ to be maximal and $Z$ to be central subgroup of order $p$. Case 1: $Z\subset M$ We prove by induction on $|P|$. For the base case, $|P|=p$. There is no maximal subgroup in $P$, hence the result holds Assume that the result holds for all $p$-group $Q$ with $|Q|<|P|$ Note that $|Z|>1$. Hence $|P/Z|<|P|$. Suppose that $M/Z$ is not a maximal subgroup of $P/Z$. Then there exists a subgroup $H$ such that $M/Z\subset H/Z \subset P/Z$. But this also implies that $M\subset H \subset P$.

72,Ore extensions of noetherian $k$-algebras are again noetherian (proof explanation),Ore extensions of noetherian -algebras are again noetherian (proof explanation),k,"Let $k$ be a field. All occuring $k$-algebras are required to be associative and unital. By noetherian I always mean left noetherian. In a lecture I’m currently taking the notion of an Ore extension of a $k$-algebra was introduced (the definition used here can be found at the very end of this post). I’m having trouble understanding a crucial step in the proof of the following theorem: Theorem: Suppose $R[t,\alpha,\delta]$ is an Ore extension of a $k$-algebra $R$. If $R$ is noetherian, then $R[t,\alpha,\delta]$ is also noetherian. Proof: Let $I \trianglelefteq R[t,\alpha,\delta]$ be a left ideal. We show that $I$ is finitely generated.   For $d \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ let    $$  I_d := \left\{a \in R \,\middle|\, \exists P \in I, \deg P = d, P = \sum_{i=0}^d a_i t^i : a_d = a\right\} \cup \{0\}. $$   $I_d$ is a left ideal in $R$. If $a$ is the leading coefficient of $P \in I$ then $\alpha(a)$ is the leading coefficient of $t \cdot P$. Hence $\alpha(I_d) \subseteq I_{d+1}$. It follows that   $$  I_0 \subseteq \alpha^{-1}(I_1) \subseteq \alpha^{-2}(I_2) \subseteq \dotsb \subseteq \alpha^{-n}(I_n) \subseteq \dotsb $$   is an increasing chain of left ideals in $R$. Because $R$ is noetherian this chain stabilizes for some $N$. Then $\color{red}{I_{N+i} = \alpha^i(I_N)}$ for all $i \geq 0$. For $0 \leq d \leq N$ choose generators $a_{d,1}, \dotsc, a_{d,\ell(d)}$ of $I_d$ and polynomials $P_{d,j} \in I$ of degree $d$ such that $a_{d,j}$ is the leading coefficient of $P_{d,j}$. Then $\{P_{d,j} \mid 0 \leq d \leq N, 1 \leq j \leq \ell(d)\}$ generates $I$ (details left as an exercise). I see that this proof is a generalization of the usual proof of Hilbert’s basis theorem, and by using that $I_{N+i} = \alpha^i(I_N)$ for all $i \geq 0$ I’m able to finish the proof. My problem is that I don’t see why $I_{N+i} = \alpha^i(I_N)$ for all $i \geq 0$. It seems to me that we only get that $$  \alpha^{-N}(I_N) = \alpha^{-(N+i)}(I_{N+i})   \quad \text{for all $i \geq 0$}. $$ As $\alpha$ is not necessarily surjective this is a weaker statement. I would like to know: Is it even true that   $$  \text{there exists $N \in \mathbb{N}$ with  $\alpha^i(I_N) = I_{N+i}$ for all $i \geq 0$?} $$ If it is not true, then does the above statement   $$  \alpha^{-N}(I_N) = \alpha^{-(N+i)}(I_{N+i})  \quad\text{for all $i \geq 0$} $$   suffices to prove the theorem? While it is not the focus of this question I also include a sketch of the rest of the proof, to show how I use that $\alpha^i(I_N) = I_{N+i}$ for all $i \geq 0$. Rest of the proof (Sketch): Let $J := \langle P_{d,j} \mid 0 \leq d \leq N, 1 \leq j \leq \ell(d) \rangle \subseteq I$. It is easy to see that $P \in J$ for every $P \in I$ with $\deg P \leq N$. Suppose that $P = \sum_{i=0}^d a_i t^i \in I$ with $P \notin J$, and that $P$ is of smallest degree with this property. Then $d > N$, so $\color{green}{I_d = \alpha^i(I_N)}$ for $i = d-N > 0$. Because $a_d \in I_d$ there exists some $a \in I_N$ with $a_d = \alpha^i(a)$. Let $r_1, \dotsc, r_n \in R$ with   $$  a = \sum_{j=1}^{\ell(N)} r_j a_{N,j} $$   and set   $$  Q := \sum_{j=1}^{\ell(N)} r_j P_{N,j} $$   So $Q \in J$ is of degree $N$ and has $a$ as its leading coefficient. By induction it follows that $t^m Q \in J$ is of degree $N+m$ with leading coefficient $\alpha^m(a)$ for all $m \geq 0$. In particular $t^i Q \in J$ is of degree $d$ and has leading coefficient $\alpha^i(a) = a_d$. As $P \notin J$ it follows that $P - t^i Q \notin J$. Because $P - t^i Q \in I$ with $\deg(P - t^i Q) < d = \deg(P)$ this contradicts the choice of $P$. The used definition of an Ore extension: Proposition/Definition: Suppose that $R$ is a $k$-algebra without zero divisors, $\alpha \colon R \to R$ is an injective $k$-algebra morphism and $\delta \colon R \to R$ is an $\alpha$-derivation, i.e. $\delta$ is $k$-linear with   $$  \delta(ab) = \alpha(a)\delta(b) + \delta(a)b  \quad \text{for all $a,b \in R$}. $$   Then there exists a unique $k$-algebra structure on $R[t] = \bigoplus_{i \geq 0} R t^i$ such that the inclusion $R \hookrightarrow R[t]$, $r \mapsto r t^0$ is a morphism of $k$-algebras, $\deg(PQ) = \deg(P) + \deg(Q)$ for all $P,Q \in R[t]$, $t \cdot a = \alpha(a) \cdot t + \delta(a)$ for every $a \in R$. This $k$-algebra is called an Ore extension of $R$ and denoted by $R[t,\alpha,\delta]$.

I’m having trouble understanding a crucial step in the proof of the following theorem: Theorem: Suppose $R[t,\alpha,\delta]$ is an Ore extension of a $k$-algebra $R$. If $R$ is noetherian, then $R[t,\alpha,\delta]$ is also noetherian. Proof: Let $I \trianglelefteq R[t,\alpha,\delta]$ be a left ideal. We show that $I$ is finitely generated.   For $d \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ let    $$  I_d := \left\{a \in R \,\middle|\, \exists P \in I, \deg P = d, P = \sum_{i=0}^d a_i t^i : a_d = a\right\} \cup \{0\}. $$   $I_d$ is a left ideal in $R$. If $a$ is the leading coefficient of $P \in I$ then $\alpha(a)$ is the leading coefficient of $t \cdot P$. Hence $\alpha(I_d) \subseteq I_{d+1}$. It follows that   $$  I_0 \subseteq \alpha^{-1}(I_1) \subseteq \alpha^{-2}(I_2) \subseteq \dotsb \subseteq \alpha^{-n}(I_n) \subseteq \dotsb $$   is an increasing chain of left ideals in $R$. Because $R$ is noetherian this chain stabilizes for some $N$. Then $\color{red}{I_{N+i} = \alpha^i(I_N)}$ for all $i \geq 0$. For $0 \leq d \leq N$ choose generators $a_{d,1}, \dotsc, a_{d,\ell(d)}$ of $I_d$ and polynomials $P_{d,j} \in I$ of degree $d$ such that $a_{d,j}$ is the leading coefficient of $P_{d,j}$. Then $\{P_{d,j} \mid 0 \leq d \leq N, 1 \leq j \leq \ell(d)\}$ generates $I$ (details left as an exercise). I see that this proof is a generalization of the usual proof of Hilbert’s basis theorem, and by using that $I_{N+i} = \alpha^i(I_N)$ for all $i \geq 0$ I’m able to finish the proof. My problem is that I don’t see why $I_{N+i} = \alpha^i(I_N)$ for all $i \geq 0$. It seems to me that we only get that $$  \alpha^{-N}(I_N) = \alpha^{-(N+i)}(I_{N+i})   \quad \text{for all $i \geq 0$}. $$ As $\alpha$ is not necessarily surjective this is a weaker statement. I would like to know: Is it even true that   $$  \text{there exists $N \in \mathbb{N}$ with  $\alpha^i(I_N) = I_{N+i}$ for all $i \geq 0$?} $$ If it is not true, then does the above statement   $$  \alpha^{-N}(I_N) = \alpha^{-(N+i)}(I_{N+i})  \quad\text{for all $i \geq 0$} $$   suffices to prove the theorem? While it is not the focus of this question I also include a sketch of the rest of the proof, to show how I use that $\alpha^i(I_N) = I_{N+i}$ for all $i \geq 0$. Rest of the proof (Sketch): Let $J := \langle P_{d,j} \mid 0 \leq d \leq N, 1 \leq j \leq \ell(d) \rangle \subseteq I$. It is easy to see that $P \in J$ for every $P \in I$ with $\deg P \leq N$. Suppose that $P = \sum_{i=0}^d a_i t^i \in I$ with $P \notin J$, and that $P$ is of smallest degree with this property. Then $d > N$, so $\color{green}{I_d = \alpha^i(I_N)}$ for $i = d-N > 0$. Because $a_d \in I_d$ there exists some $a \in I_N$ with $a_d = \alpha^i(a)$. Let $r_1, \dotsc, r_n \in R$ with   $$  a = \sum_{j=1}^{\ell(N)} r_j a_{N,j} $$   and set   $$  Q := \sum_{j=1}^{\ell(N)} r_j P_{N,j} $$   So $Q \in J$ is of degree $N$ and has $a$ as its leading coefficient. By induction it follows that $t^m Q \in J$ is of degree $N+m$ with leading coefficient $\alpha^m(a)$ for all $m \geq 0$. In particular $t^i Q \in J$ is of degree $d$ and has leading coefficient $\alpha^i(a) = a_d$. As $P \notin J$ it follows that $P - t^i Q \notin J$. Because $P - t^i Q \in I$ with $\deg(P - t^i Q) < d = \deg(P)$ this contradicts the choice of $P$. The used definition of an Ore extension: Proposition/Definition: Suppose that $R$ is a $k$-algebra without zero divisors, $\alpha \colon R \to R$ is an injective $k$-algebra morphism and $\delta \colon R \to R$ is an $\alpha$-derivation, i.e. $\delta$ is $k$-linear with   $$  \delta(ab) = \alpha(a)\delta(b) + \delta(a)b  \quad \text{for all $a,b \in R$}. $$   Then there exists a unique $k$-algebra structure on $R[t] = \bigoplus_{i \geq 0} R t^i$ such that the inclusion $R \hookrightarrow R[t]$, $r \mapsto r t^0$ is a morphism of $k$-algebras, $\deg(PQ) = \deg(P) + \deg(Q)$ for all $P,Q \in R[t]$, $t \cdot a = \alpha(a) \cdot t + \delta(a)$ for every $a \in R$. This $k$-algebra is called an Ore extension of $R$ and denoted by $R[t,\alpha,\delta]$.

86,How to define the operation of division apart from the inverse of multiplication?,How to define the operation of division apart from the inverse of multiplication?,,"Sorry if this question is too far out there, but I'm looking for a rigorous definition of the division operation.  As I have seen it before, $a/b$ is the solution to the equation $a=xb$.  While I am okay with this sort of defintion, it is tantamount to saying that division is the inverse operation of multiplication.  (at least that's how I see it, comments on this assertion are welcome.) Instead, what I seek is a different sort of formalization of the definition of division of real numbers.  Whereas the definition above is nearly equivalent to defining division as the inverse operation of multiplication (again, maybe i'm wrong), I seek a definition that does not rely on the definition of multiplication already being asserted. Motivation :  Consider the fundamental theorem of calculus that essentially states that the indefinite integral is the inverse of the derivative.  This is a highly non-trivial theorem, and while one may be able to define the indefinite integral as the inverse of the derivative (could be wrong here as well), it is much more meaningful to define the two operations separately and then show that they're actually just inverses of one another.  Does anything like this exist for multiplication and division?  Or are these operations just too fundamental?
