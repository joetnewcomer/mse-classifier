But on the other hand considering Example 3.8 does not suggest anything about the requirement of uniqueness in the context of groups. So is uniqueness of the identity in groups important in establishing that groups are pointed sets? https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/pointed+object defines pointed object to be an object equipped with a global element where a global element is just a morphism from a terminal object to . A pointed set is the defined to be a pointed object is . Now if I take this definition of a pointed set then every non-empty set in is a pointed object, which isn't quite what the author had in mind when compared to Example 3.8? Or maybe I didn't understand the definition given on nLab. Is it possible to show via example that this definition in nLab is indeed equivalent? To complicate things further, if I use the definition in nLab then in Chapter 2 page 64 being a pointed set does not make sense to me since I don't even know what category this is in as an object. So what does Aluffi mean by 'pointed set'? What made a pointed set? Is it merely that it's not empty, or is there something 'special' about the trivial morphism that makes into a pointed set? At this point, I don't even know what pointed set means anymore and I feel perplexed at this point.","(X,x) X x\in X X 1\to X 1 X \mathbf{Set} \mathbf{Set} \text{Hom}_{\mathbf{Grp}}(G,H) \text{Hom}_{\mathbf{Grp}}(G,H) \text{Hom}_{\mathbf{Grp}}(G,H)","['abstract-algebra', 'group-theory', 'category-theory', 'definition']"
