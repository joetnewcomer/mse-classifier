However, I don't exactly know how to approach this problem. What I've tried: My first naive approach was to consider $G$ as a Lie subgroup of $\operatorname{GL}_2(\mathbb R)$ and use the one-parameter subgroup $$\gamma(t) = e^{tA}$$ since $$A \in {\frak{g}} \iff e^{tA} \in G\quad \forall t\in \mathbb R$$ However, I'm not sure how to proceed from here since, unlike in the examples of the common Lie subgroups $O(n), \operatorname{SO}(n)$ or $\operatorname{GL}_n(\mathbb R)$ , I don't see a straight forward property of elements of $G$ that would be of help in order to use the exponential map accordingly. My second thought was choosing a one-parameter subgroup $$\gamma\colon \mathbb R\to G$$ s.t. $\gamma(0) = E$ , one possible one-parameter subgroup would be $$\gamma(t) = \begin{pmatrix} 1+t & 0 \\ 0 & (1+t)^{-1}\end{pmatrix}$$ Now clearly $\gamma(0) = E$ .

I'm working on an exercise from a book in basic Gaussian geometry, and as a part of my solution, I would like to make the following claim: Proposition. If $M\subseteq\mathbb{R}^3$ is a complete regular surface, $M$ is a closed subset of $\mathbb{R}^3$. given the following definition of completeness: Definition. A regular surface $M\subseteq\mathbb{R}^3$ is said to be complete if for every point $p\in M$ and every tangent vector $Z\in T_pM$, there exists a geodesic $\gamma\colon\mathbb{R}\to M$ defined on all of $\mathbb{R}$ such that $\gamma (0)=p$ and $\gamma'(0)=Z$. I have tried mainly two ways of proving it: Idea 1. What seems most natural to me is to do this by contradiction, and to use the limit point characterization of closed sets in metric spaces. I thus let $M\subseteq \mathbb{R}^3$ be a complete regular surface, and suppose that $M$ is not closed. This means there exists a convergent sequence $(p_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with limit $q$, such that $p_n\in M$ for all $n\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ and $q\in\mathbb{R}^3\setminus M$. The way I picture this intuitively, is that the surface $M$ is punctured at $q$ or have something like an ""edge "" at $q$. Since there are $p_n$'s arbitrarily close to $q$, it feels like we should be able to find a $p_n$ and a $Z\in T_{p_n}M$, such that the geodesic $\gamma\colon \mathbb{R}\to M$,  with $\gamma (0)=p_n$ and $\gamma'(0)=Z$, would have to pass through $q$, thus giving us the desired contradiction. I don't see any obvious ways to turn this into a formal argument though, and my gut feeling can very well be wrong. Idea 2. I have also looked a bit at the Hopf-Rinow theorem from Riemannian geometry, which seems to say that a Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$ being geodesically complete implies that $(M,\tilde{d})$ is complete as a metric space, where $\tilde{d}$ is the intrinsic metric. If something similar holds for regular surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$, I think we would be done (no!), because $\tilde{d}$ dominates the standard metric $d$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ restricted to $M$. This means that if $\rlap{\rule[0.5ex]{2.5em}{0.2ex}}(M,\tilde{d})$ is complete, so is $\rlap{\rule[0.5ex]{3.5em}{0.2ex}}(M,d_{|M})$ (this is wrong, see my comment below!). Since $(\mathbb{R}^3,d)$ is complete, $(M,d_{|M})$ being complete implies that $M$ is closed by elementary point-set topology . However, my spontanious idea of how do show that geodesically complete implies complete as a metric space would be very similar to Idea 1 (I would seek a contradiction by supposing that we have a Cauchy sequence in $M$ that doesn't converge), so this doesn't seem to take me any further either.

On a Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$, coordinate functions $(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ are called isothermal if the metric is locally conformal to the Euclidean metric in these coordinates, that is, if $g$ is locally of the shape $d s^2 = \lambda(x_1, \dots, x_n) (d x_1^2 + \dots + d x_n^2)$ for some $\lambda(x_1, \dots, x_n) > 0$. Firstly, Deturck and Kazdan prove that on any Riemannian manifold, harmonic coordinate functions (where the Lacplace operator of the function is $= 0$) exist everywhere locally. Now to prove the existence of isothermal coordinates in the $2$-dimensional case, this allows to choose a harmonic function $u$ with non-vanishing derivative as the first component. So far I can follow. Now in the next step, they choose the second coordinate function $v$ using the Hodge star operator $\star$. Since $d u$ is a $1$-form and the Hodge star sends $1$-forms to $1$-forms, $\star d u $ is also a $1$-form. Now because $\star du$ is closed, the Poincaré lemma ensures the existence of a coordinate function $v$ satisfying $d v = \star du$. Finally, they show that $v$ is also harmonic through a simple calculation. Now my question is: how can I see that these coordinate functions $(u, v)$ constructed this way are actually isothermal? Deturck and Kazdan don't seem to elaborate on that unless I have missed it somewhere, so maybe it's very easy and just I'm missing something trivial, but I've been trying to wrap my head around why the off-diagonal entries of the metric become $= 0$ when representing it with respect to these coordinate functions.

This metric is known as the fubini study metric. Another way to construct a metric on $\mathbb C P^n$ is the following: Consider $SU(n + 1)$ equipped with the bi-invariant metric $\langle , \rangle$ given by $\langle X,Y \rangle = trace(XY^*)$, where $^ *$ denotes the conjugate transpose and $X,Y \in \mathcal{su}(n + 1)$, the Lie Algebra of $SU(n + 1)$ concsisting of traceless anti-hermitian matrices. Let $S(U(n) \times U(1)) \subset SU(n + 1)$ be the subgroup consisting of elements \begin{pmatrix} \det A^{-1} & 0 \\ 0 & A \\ \end{pmatrix} for $A \in U(n)$. I learned that we have $\mathbb C P^n \cong SU(n + 1)/S(U(n) \times U(1)).$ My question is if the induced quotient metric coincides with the Fubini Study metric.",,"['differential-geometry', 'lie-groups', 'lie-algebras']"

I want to show that the associated Laplacian $\Delta:=2(\bar{\partial}^*\bar{\partial}+\bar{\partial}\bar{\partial}^*)$ (one could take $d,\partial$ instead, but I think $\bar{\partial}$ is more convenient here) has the following expression acting on functions : $$\Delta f=-2g^{\bar{j}k}\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial z^j\partial\bar{z}^k}.$$ It is remarkable that this formula does not involve derivatives of the metric! Here is my attempt: Given functions $f,\phi$ compactly supported on a holomorphic chart, we compute the $L^2$ inner product $$\frac{1}{2}(\Delta f,\phi)=(\partial f,\partial\phi)=\int_{\mathbb{C}^n}\frac{\partial f}{\partial\bar{z}^j}\frac{\partial\bar{\phi}}{\partial z^k}g^{\bar{j}k}G,$$ where $G=\det(g_{j\bar{k}})$ (coefficient of the volume form).

The hint I was given was to look at the fundamental group of the complement of the zero section. For the tangent bundle, I used that the bundle has local trivializations $U_1=\mathbb{CP}^1 - [0:1]$ and $U_2=\mathbb{CP}^1 - [1:0]$. I then applied the siefert van kampen theorem $$\pi_1 (TU_i-\sigma_0) \cong \pi_1 (U_i \times \mathbb{C}^*) \cong \pi_1 (U_i) \oplus \pi_1 (\mathbb{C}^*) \cong \mathbb{Z} a_i$$ $$\pi_1 (T(U_1 \cap U_2) - \sigma_0) \cong \pi_1 ((U_1 \cap U_2) \times \mathbb{C}^*) \cong \pi_1((U_1 \cap U_2)) \oplus \pi_1(\mathbb{C}^*) \cong \mathbb{Z}c \oplus \mathbb{Z}d$$ Then the fundamental group will be $\mathbb{Z}a_1 *\mathbb{Z}a_2$ quotiented by the images of c and d. c will be homotopic to a point and so the fundamental group will be $\mathbb{Z}a_1 *\mathbb{Z}a_2$ quotiented by the image of $\mathbb{Z}d$. Since the former has two generators and the latter only one, this cannot be trivial. What I have so far I believe is correct, please tell me otherwise if it is not. What remains is to show that the tautological bundle minus the zero section has trivial fundamental group.

93,Prove that ${x dy - y d x\over x^2 + y^2}$ is not exact,Prove that  is not exact,{x dy - y d x\over x^2 + y^2},Please can someone verify my proof that $$\psi = {x dy - y d x\over x^2 + y^2}$$ is not exact? Here is my work: If $\psi$ was exact there would exist $f:\mathbb R^2 \setminus \{0\} \to \mathbb R$ such that $df = f_x dx + f_y dy = \psi$ . Here $f_x = {-y \over x^2 + y^2}$ and $f_y = {x \over x^2 + y^2}$ . It would hold true that $$\int f_x dx = \int f_y dy = f.$$ So I calculate these integrals: $$ \int f_x dx = -{1\over 2}\log(x^2 + y^2)$$ and $$ \int f_y dy = {1\over 2}\log(x^2 + y^2)$$ It is clear that these cannot be equal therefore $\psi$ is not exact. Edit The first thing I had tried (it did not work) was to calculate the integral along a closed curve: $$ \int_{S^1}\psi = \int_{S^1} {x \over x^2 + y^2} dy - \int_{S^1} {y \over x^2 + y^2} dx = \int_{S^1} x dy - \int_{S^1} y dx= x \int_{S^1}  dy - y \int_{S^1}  dx = 0$$ since $\int_{S^1}dx = 0$ .,Please can someone verify my proof that is not exact?
