2,A functional equation $(f(x)+1)f(f(x))=x(x+1)$,A functional equation,(f(x)+1)f(f(x))=x(x+1),"I am trying to find all solutions for the following functional equation: $$f:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{R}, \ \ s.t. \ \ (f(x)+1)f(f(x))=x(x+1)$$ It is clear that $f(x)=x$ is a solution for this equation. However, I'd like to prove that this is the only solution (or find a general formula for all the solutions). My attempt was to first find $f(0)$ : For $x=0$ , $(1+f(0))f(f(0)) = 0$ so either $f(0)=-1$ or $f(f(0))=0$ . For the second case, let $x=f(0)$ , so $(1+f(f(0)))f(f(f(0))) = f(0)(f(0)+1)$ , therefore $f(0)=f(0)(f(0)+1)$ , where we find that $f(0)=0$ . As such, I have proven that either $f(0)=-1$ or $f(0)=0$ . Being inspired by the technique for finding $f(0)$ , I wrote the functional equations for $x=n$ and $x=f(n)$ . $$(1+f(n))f(f(n)) = n(n+1)$$ $$(1+f(f(n)))f(f(f(n))) = f(n)(f(n)+1)$$ and by dividing we obtain: $$f(n)  \cdot f(f(n)) = n(n+1) \cdot (1+f(f(n)))f(f(f(n)))$$ Or, by plugging in $x=n$ and $x=n-1$ , we get the two equations $$(1+f(n))f(f(n)) = n(n+1)$$ $$(1+f(n-1))f(f(n-1))=n(n-1)$$ an idea is to find a formula for $f(n)$ in terms of $f(n-1)$ , but I am stuck how I could find such an equation without including $f(f(n))$ .

Before I get to that, I am trying to understand the example given of a monomorphism that is not left-invertible. Below is a quote from page 14: For example, the map $n \mapsto 2n$ defines a left-cancellative group homomorphism $f \colon \mathbb Z / 2 \mathbb Z \to \mathbb Z / 4 \mathbb Z$ . However, there is no group homomorphism $g \colon \mathbb Z / 4 \mathbb Z \to \mathbb Z / 2 \mathbb Z$ so that $gf = \text{id}_{\mathbb Z / 2 \mathbb Z}$ . I try to explain this to myself as follows. We have a homomorphism $f$ such that $f([0]_2) = [0]_4$ and $f([1]_2) = [2]_4$ . The text says on page 14 that a function is injective $\Leftrightarrow$ function is left-cancellative.

Unfortunately I cannot justify the assertion that there is no $g$ such that $gf = \text{id}_{\mathbb Z / 2 \mathbb Z}$ .

Possibility 1) $\dim\operatorname{Ker} F = 2$ If the dimension of kernel is $2$ , that is, image is zero dimensional according to Theorem 3.2 ( $\dim \operatorname{Im} F = \dim\mathbb{R}^{2} - \dim\operatorname{Ker}F = 2 - 2 = 0$ ), then considering that kernel is a subspace, $\mathbb{R}^2 = \operatorname{Ker}F$ , and therefore $F$ is a zero map having the image of $\{0\}$ .

Suppose we have $f(x)$ and we define $g(x)$ as: $$g(x):=x-\frac{f(x)}{f'(x)}$$ Why are the roots of $g'(x)$ and $f(x)$ almost identical? Almost because although some are numerically equivalent, all the roots are not the same. Consider $f(x):=x^2+3 x-1$, then $g'(x)$ is $\frac{2 \left(x^2+3 x-1\right)}{(2 x+3)^2}$, both functions' roots are: $$\left\{x\to \frac{1}{2} \left(-\sqrt{13}-3\right)\right\},\left\{x\to \frac{1}{2} \left(\sqrt{13}-3\right)\right\}$$ Consider $f(x):=x^5-2 x^4+2 x^3-2 x^2-x+\frac{1}{2}$, then the real roots are: $$\{x\to -0.52325\},\{x\to 0.33225\},\{x\to 1.66996\}$$ The roots of $g'(x)$ are: $$\{x\to 0.756324\},\{x\to -0.52325\},\{x\to 0.33225\},\{x\to 1.66996\}$$","Made a small observation, and I'm looking for a possible explanation.

99,Is this function $f$ continous?,Is this function  continous?,f,"Let $f:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb R$ with  $$ f(x,y)=\begin{cases}\frac{x^2}{||(x,y)||}&\text{for }(x,y)\neq(0,0)\\ 0&\text{for }(x,y)=(0,0)\end{cases} $$ The norm is not further specified. As every norm is continuous and $||(x,y)||=0$ iff $(x,y)=(0,0)$, we have that $f$ is continuous for every $(x,y)\neq (0,0)$(as $x^2$ is obviously continuous). (0,0) gives me more troubles as I don't know how to handle the unspecified norm. I know that all norms over $\mathbb R^2$ are equivalent, so there may be a way to convert this problem into a version using the classical Euclidean norm.","Let $f:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb R$ with  $$ f(x,y)=\begin{cases}\frac{x^2}{||(x,y)||}&\text{for }(x,y)\neq(0,0)\\ 0&\text{for }(x,y)=(0,0)\end{cases} $$ The norm is not further specified.
