1,"Is it true that for algebraic sets $V,W$ we have $I(V \times W ) =I(V) + I(W)$?",Is it true that for algebraic sets  we have ?,"V,W I(V \times W ) =I(V) + I(W)","This is a follow up question to my previous question here. Let $k$ be a field and $V \subseteq \Bbb{A}^n$ and $W \subseteq \Bbb{A}^m$ be algebraic sets. Then it should be true that $I(V \times W ) = I(V) + I(W)$ where by $I(V)$ here we mean the extension of $I(V)k[x_1,\ldots,x_{m+n}]$. Now I believe I have proven this (see the proof at the bottom of my question) but when I look at Martin's answer here , it is instead claimed that we  actually have $$I(V \times W )= \sqrt{I(V) + I(W)},$$ and for $I(V) + I(W)$ to be a radical ideal we need $k$ to be algebraically closed. My question is: What's going on here? I believe my claim is true even without the assumption that $k$ is algebraically closed. Here's a proof user Sanchez told me of, which I have simplified: First it is clear that we always have $I(V) + I(W) \subseteq I(V \times W)$. For the reverse inclusion consider a polynomial $f \in I(V \times W)$. Then we can always write $$f = \sum_{i=1}^n f_ig_i$$ where $f_i \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ and $g_i \in k[x_{n+1},\ldots,x_{m+n}]$. Now take any $b' \in W$. If for all $i$ we have $g_i(b') = 0$ then since $b'$ is arbitrary, $g_i \in I(W)$ for all $i$. Then $f \in I(W) \subseteq I(V ) + I(w)$ and we are done. Otherwise suppose there exists $b \in W$  and $i$ such that $g_i(b) \neq 0$. Then wlog we may suppose that  $g_1(b) \neq 0$. Next, $\sum f_ig_i(b) = 0 $ on all of $V$ by assumption of $f \in I(V \times W)$. So $\sum f_i g_i(b) = p$ for some $p \in I(V)$. Now write $$f_1 = \frac{ p - g_2(b) f_2 + \ldots g_n(b)f_n}{g_1(b)}.$$ Substituting this for $f_1$ in $\sum f_ig_i$, followed by taking things mod $I(V)$ we get an  expression with only $n-1$ terms $\mod{I(V)}$. Continuing this process we will finally get an expression with $0$ terms $\mod{I(V)}$ so that $f \in I(V)$. This shows $I(V \times W) \subseteq I(V) + I(W)$ which completes the proof.","This is a follow up question to my previous question here.

Well, I know that the ring $S=k[x_0,\dots,x_n]$ is Cohen-Macauley, so we have the unmixedness theorem in $S$. That is, whenever an ideal $J\subset S$ of codimension $q$ can be generated by $q$ elements, it is unmixed: it shares its own height with all of its associated primes - the elements of $\textrm{Ass}_S(S/J)$.

28,Does every vector bundle have a 'tensor inverse'?,Does every vector bundle have a 'tensor inverse'?,,"For any vector bundle $E$ over a finite-dimensional CW complex, there is a vector bundle $E'$ such that $E\oplus E'$ is trivial. For a compact Hausdorff base, this is Proposition 1.4 of Hatcher's Vector Bundles and K Theory , while the general case can be deduced from Tom Goodwillie's comments here . Finite-dimensionality of the base is a necessary hypothesis as the tautological line bundle $\gamma^1 \to \mathbb{RP}^{\infty}$ demonstrates (see Example 3.6 of Hatcher). While these references only deal with real vector bundles, the analogous statements are true for complex vector bundles too (the arguments carry over easily). My question is whether there is an analogue of the above result when direct sum is replaced by tensor product. Question: Let $E$ be a vector bundle over a finite-dimensional CW complex. Is there a vector bundle $E'' \neq 0$ such that $E\otimes E''$ is trivial? One case where such a bundle exists is when $E$ is a line bundle: we can take $E'' = E^*$ as $E\otimes E^* \cong \operatorname{End}(E)$ which is a rank one bundle with a nowhere-zero section, namely $\operatorname{id}_E$ . Stiefel-Whitney classes do not provide any obstructions to the existence of such a bundle. More precisely, for any bundle $E$ over a CW complex of dimension $d$ , there is a bundle $E'' \neq 0$ such that $w(E\otimes E'') = 1$ . To see this, first choose an integer $j$ such that $2^j > d$ . Now note that \begin{align*} w(E\otimes\varepsilon^{2^j}) &= w(E^{\oplus 2^j})\\  &= w(E)^{2^j}\\  &= (1 + w_1(E) + \dots + w_d(E))^{2^j}\\  &= 1 + w_1(E)^{2^j} + \dots + w_d(E)^{2^j}\\  &= 1 \end{align*} as $\deg w_i(E)^{2^j} = i2^j > d$ for $i > 0$ . Although one can compute Pontryagin classes of tensor products, see here , I haven't been able to establish the existence of a bundle $E'' \neq 0$ with $p(E\otimes E'') = 1$ (or even just $p_1(E\otimes E'') = 0$ ). You can use Pontryagin classes to show that $E\otimes\varepsilon^{2^j}$ can be non-trivial, i.e. the above trick to kill Stiefel-Whitney classes won't necessarily give rise to a trivial bundle. For example, if $E = T\mathbb{CP}^2$ , the bundle $E\otimes\varepsilon^{2^j}$ is non-trivial for all $j \geq 0$ as $p_1(E^{\oplus 2^j}) = 2^jp_1(E) = 2^jp_1(T\mathbb{CP}^2) \neq 0$ . One thing which makes the direct sum analogue easier to attack is the fact that the existence of a bundle $E'$ with $E\oplus E'$ trivial is equivalent to $E$ being a subbundle of a trivial bundle. I am not aware of a condition on $E$ that is equivalent to the existence of a bundle $E'' \neq 0$ with $E\otimes E''$ trivial. I was hoping that the existence of such a bundle could be interpreted in terms of K theory, but I don't think this is possible as the triviality of $E\otimes E''$ doesn't imply the triviality of $(E\oplus\varepsilon^k)\otimes E''$ .","For any vector bundle over a finite-dimensional CW complex, there is a vector bundle such that is trivial.

I have some questions about this topological space: Why should the ideals be prime? As far as I can tell, it seems to be a technical condition to allow union of open sets to work. Is there a deeper reason? Why do we generate the closed sets as collections of prime ideals?

If anything, it is an ""anti-variety"". Perhaps I have missed something in proving that $\operatorname{Spec}(A)$ is a topological space, so I will recapitulate proof sketches below. First, the topology on $\operatorname{Spec}(A)$ is given by stating that the closed sets of the topology are given by: $$ V: 2^A \rightarrow 2^{\operatorname{Spec}};  V(S) \equiv \{ I \in \operatorname{Spec}(A): S \subseteq I\} \\   \tau_\text{closed} \equiv \{ V(S): S \subseteq A \} $$ That is, for every subset $S$ of $A$ , the set of prime ideals that contain $S$ [which is denoted as $V(S)$ ] is a closed set.

52,Affine scheme $X$ with $\dim(X)=0$ but infinitely many points,Affine scheme  with  but infinitely many points,X \dim(X)=0,"As the title says, I'm looking for an affine scheme of dimension zero, but with infinitely many points. At first I doubted that something like this could exist, and I still can't think of an example, but I'm beginning to think there must be one. Such a scheme corresponds to a zero-dimensional ring $A$ of Krull dimension $0$, i.e. the only 'chains' of prime ideals in $A$ have to be the prime ideals themselves. If $k$ is a field, I could take $n$-fold product $k^n=k\times...\times k$. The prime ideals in $k^n$ are exactly those of the form $k\times...\times\langle0\rangle\times...\times k$, with the $\langle0\rangle$ at any position. Hence in $k^n$ there are no chains of prime ideals of length greater than $0$. But of course we only have finitely many (namely, $n$) points. Is it possible to carry this construction over to an infinite product of copies of $k$? Take for example $k^\mathbb{N}$, which is a countable product of copies of $k$. At first I thought this was just $k[[x]]$, but the ring structure is not the same. Wikipedia states that in such an infinite product there exist ideals which are not of the type $\prod_{n\in\mathbb{N}}I_n$. An example is the ideal $I$ of elements of $k^\mathbb{N}$ with only finitely many non-zero components. Although having an infinite indexing set, products of ideals of $k$ that contain only one factor $\langle 0\rangle$ are still prime, so we have infinitely many points in $\operatorname{Spec}(k^\mathbb{N})$. But what about the dimension? There exist other prime ideals, so I'm not sure how to go on about that. Does $k^\mathbb{N}$ work at all, or are there other - maybe simpler - examples? Or even none? EDIT: In case of an infinite product of rings $A_i$, does the spectrum of $\prod_i A_i$ still correspond to some disjoint union of schemes? In my case, geometrically thought: by taking one more copy of $k$ into the product, we are adding a new point to our affine scheme. So from my intuition, the construction of $k^\mathbb{N}$ as an affine scheme with inf. many points and dimension $0$ should be working. The rest of the exercise (Find examples or prove there are none. A short check if what I write is correct would be very kind): An affine scheme $X$ with $\dim(X)=1$ and exactly one point.

EDIT : As pointed out by Martin Brandenburg below, in general, the product of non-separated schemes could be separated. However, I think it is true that if the schemes are all over some field $k$ then non-separated-ness is preserved under taking products. Is this true, and if so, how would one prove it?",,"['algebraic-geometry', 'schemes']"

Why is there for every line bundle (invertible sheaf) $L$ on $X_\eta$ a nonempty open subset $U\subseteq C$ and a line bundle $\mathcal{L}$ on $X_U:=X\times_CU$ with $\mathcal{L}|_{X_\eta}=L$? And if there's another open subset $U'\subseteq C$ and another line bundle $\mathcal{L'}$ satisfying $\mathcal{L}'|_{X_\eta}=L$, is there an open subset $W\subseteq U\cap U'$ with $\mathcal{L}|_W=\mathcal{L}'|_W$? Edit: Previously I had the setting $U\subseteq X$, but now there's the right question.","Let $C$ be a regular projective integer curve over a field $k$ and $X\rightarrow C$ a projective $k$-Variety with generic fibre $X_\eta$.

99,An inverse limit,An inverse limit,,"Let $k$ be a field. Consider the inverse limit $\varprojlim k[x,y]/(y\cdot x^n)$. I wonder if there is a nice description of this ring? Geometrically, we look at the union of the line $y=0$ along with an infinitesimal neighborhood of the line $x=0$. But what happens in the limit? I think we get $k[y][[x]]$?
