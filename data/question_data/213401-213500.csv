0,How would you solve for all solutions of $\sin(2x)=\cos(3x)$ algebraically?,How would you solve for all solutions of  algebraically?,\sin(2x)=\cos(3x),"So my buddy and I (both HS Math teachers) have been messing around with a question about finding all solutions of a ""co-function"" equation like the one above. The typical HS questions asks students to find the solution in Q1 by solving $2x + 3x = 90$. He was thinking about how to get the other solutions and we were curious to see what other people do for a problem like this. We've noticed that the solutions come in regularly spaced intervals from two separate starting points. Namely, $\frac{\pi}{10} \pm \frac{4k\pi}{10}$, AND $-\frac{\pi}{2} \pm 2k\pi$  {$k$ natural} for the above equation. We've been able to generalize this to any such co-function equation of the form $\sin(ax)=\cos(bx)$ {$a,b$ Integers} , and are curious about whether other people have stumbled upon this as well. We've also discovered a very interesting geometric interpretation of the periodic solutions and where they occur.

Any input would be greatly appreciated. We want to show that $a^n + b^n = c^n$ cannot hold for odd $n>1$ and pairwise relatively prime $a$, $b$, and $c$.  Assuming by way of contradiction that we have $a^n + b^n = c^n$ we must have $a$, $b$, and $c$ forming the sides of a triangle since $(a+b)^n > c^n$ so $a+b>c$.  Therefore the law of cosines can apply and we can write: $$c^2 = a^2+b^2 - 2ab{\cos{C}}$$ where $C$ is the angle opposite to side $c$.  If we add and subtract $2ab$ on the right-hand side we get $$c^2 = {(a+b)}^2 -2ab(\cos{C}+1)$$ Now, $a+b$ and $c$ share a common factor since $(a+b) | (a^n+b^n)$ for odd $n$ and $c^n = a^n+b^n$.  (Here $x | y$ means as usual, ""$x$ divides $y$"").Therefore, they share the same factor with $2ab(\cos{C}+1)$.   Now, $\cos{C} + 1$ must be a rational number since $a$, $b$, and $c$ are all integers.  So let $\cos{C} +1 = \frac{r}{s}$ where $r$ and $s$ are integers and $(r,s)=1$. (i.e. $\frac{r}{s}$ is a reduced fraction).  (Here, $(r,s)$ means as usual the greatest common divisor of $r$ and $s$.) Now assuming $a$, $b$, and $c$ are relatively prime we must have $(ab) |s$ for otherwise $c$ and $2ab$ would share a common factor.  Even moreso we must have $ab=s$ since otherwise $\frac{2abr}{s}$ would not be an integer.  (Since $c - a - b$ is even, we don't need $2 | s$).  So we can write: $$\cos{C}+1 = \frac{r}{ab}$$ or equivalently $$\cos{C} = \frac{r - ab}{ab}$$ Now we had from the law of cosines: $$c^2 = a^2+b^2 - 2ab{\cos{C}}$$ so making the substitution $\cos{C} = \frac{r - ab}{ab}$ we get $$c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2r + 2ab$$ If we subtract $a^2$ to both sides and factor out the $b$ on the right-hand side, we get: $$c^2 - a^2 = b(b + 2a) - 2r$$ Now, $(c - a) | (c^2 - a^2)$ and also $(c-a) | (c^n - a^n)$. Then we must have $((c-a),b) >1$ since $b^n = c^n - a^n$.  From the equation above, we must therefore also have $(b,2r) > 1$.  Similarly we can show that we must have $(a,2r) > 1$. However, both of these conclusions are problematic since $r$ was initially assumed to be relatively prime to $s = ab$.  The only other option is that $a$ and $b$ are both even, but this is also problematic since $a$ and $b$ are assumed to be relatively prime. Thus we cannot have $a^n + b^n = c^n$  for odd $n>1$ and pairwise relatively prime $a$, $b$, and $c$.
