0,Stuck on Differential Geometry proof,Stuck on Differential Geometry proof,,"My concrete questions are (for context see below): Is is true that $i$ as below embeds $M$ in $T^*\mathbb{R}^n$ ? Is it true that $M$ is Lagrangian in $\mathbb{C}^n$ if and only if $i(M)$ is Lagrangian in $T^*\mathbb{R}^n$ ? Is it true that Theorem 4.3 implies that $$dh=\text{proj}_{d\psi}y\iff dh=(\sum_ky_k\dot\psi_k)d\psi$$ as I derived below? How can I obtain the identity stated by Harvey (quoted below)? Here is the context: In his book ""Spinors and Calibrations"", F.R. Harvey provides a definition of Lawlor necks (which I restate below as Definition 1 ) as $n$ -dimensional submanifolds of $\mathbb{C}^n\cong\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ , and then introduces an equivalent characterization by looking at intersections of Lawlor necks with $n$ -planes $P_{\theta}$ , which I define below. Definition. Let $\theta=(\theta_1,\dots,\theta_n)\in\mathbb{R}^n$ . Then we denote by $$P_\theta=\{(t_1e^{i\theta_1},\dots,t_1e^{i\theta_1})\in\mathbb{C}:t_k\in\mathbb{R}\}$$ the $n$ -plane in $\mathbb{C}^n$ obtained by rotating $\mathbb{R}^n$ by $e^{i\theta}$ . $\diamond$ Harvey remarks that the intersection of a Lawlor neck $M$ with $P_\theta$ , for any $\theta$ , is either empty or a compact hypersurface of $P_\theta$ (indeed, it can be easily shown that, if not empty, $M\cap P_\theta$ is an ellipsoid). In Theorem 7.78, Harvey proves that Lawlor necks are the only possible special Lagrangian submanifolds of $\mathbb{C}^n$ that admit this property. In his proof, Harvey claims the following (which I cannot quite follow): ~verbatim quote~ ""If $M$ is to consist of the union of hypersurfaces in a family of the $n$ -planes $P_\theta$ , and $M$ is to be Lagrangian, then $M$ must be of the form (set $w_j=R_je^{i\theta_j}$ ) $$M(\Gamma,h)=\left\{ w\in\mathbb{C}^n:\sum_{j=1}^nR^2_j\frac{\text{d}\theta_j}{\text{d}s}=\frac{\text{d}h}{\text{d}s}\right\}$$ for some curve $\Gamma$ in the $\theta$ -space and some function $h(s)$ defined on $\Gamma$ (here, $\theta(s)$ parametrizes $\Gamma$ ). This can be reforumlated as a general fact about Lagrangian submanifolds with degenerate (one-dimensional) projection onto one of the Lagrangian axis planes, using the alternate symplectic coordinates $p_j=\frac{1}{2}R^2_j$ and $q_j=\theta_j$ , $j=1,\dots,n$ . (Note that $\text{d}p_j\wedge\text{d}q_j=\text{d}x_j\wedge\text{d}y_j$ . See the article 'Calibrated Geometries' by Harvey-Lawson for a proof of $M_a=M(\Gamma,h)$ .)"" ~end of quote~ I am struggling with rigorously understanding how the identity $$\sum_{j=1}^nR^2_j\frac{\text{d}\theta_j}{\text{d}s}=\frac{\text{d}h}{\text{d}s}$$ is derived (what result from'Calibrated Geometries' by Harvey-Lawson is being used?). Here is what I understand so far: The alternate symplectic coordinates let us embed a Lawlor neck $M$ into $T^*\mathbb{R}^n\cong\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}^n$ , via $$i:(r_ke^{i\theta_k})_{k=1}^n\mapsto((\theta_1,\dots,\theta_n),(r_1^2/2,\dots,r_n^2/2))$$ Since $\text{d}p_j\wedge\text{d}q_j=\text{d}x_j\wedge\text{d}y_j$ , $M$ is Lagrangian in $\mathbb{C}^n$ if and only if $i(M)$ is Lagrnagian in $T^*\mathbb{R}^n$ . Now $T^*\mathbb{R}^n$ is equipped with the natural projection $\pi:T^*\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^n$ . Clearly, we have $\pi(P_\theta)=\{\theta\}$ (where we view $P_\theta$ as a subset of $T^*\mathbb{R}^n$ via $i$ ). Since the intersection of a Lawlor neck $M$ with each plane $P_\theta$ is either empty or a ( $n-1$ dimensional) hypersurface, the projection $\pi:M\to\mathbb{R}^n$ is degenerate with constant rank $1$ . This, I beleive, lets us apply the following result from 'Calibrated Geometries' by Harvey-Lawson (Theorem 4.3): Theorem. Suppose $i(M)=X$ is an $n$ -dimensional Lagrangian submanifold of $T^{\\*}\mathbb{R}^n$ whose projection $\pi:X\to\mathbb{R}^n$ is degenerate with constant rank $p$ . Then there exists a unique pair of an $p$ -dimensional submanifold $M$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and a real-valued function $h$ on $M$ so that $X$ is the affine subbundle $A$ of $T^{\\*}\mathbb{R}^n$ obtained by translating the normal bundle $N(M)$ of $M$ in the cotagent bundle $T^{\\*}M$ by the exterior derivative $\text{d}h$ , i.e., $$A_x=N_x(M)+(dH)_x$$ for all $x\in M$ , where $H$ is some smooth extension of $h$ to the ambient space $\mathbb{R}^n$ . $\diamond$ In our case, the projection $\pi:i(M)\to\mathbb{R}^n$ has constant rank $1$ , so if $M$ is Lagrangian, there exists a $1$ -dimensional submanifold $\Gamma$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ (say $\Gamma$ is parametrized by $\psi=(\psi_1,\dots,\psi_n):\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}^n$ with $\vert{\psi}\vert\equiv1$ ) and a function $h:\Gamma\to\mathbb{R}$ (with $d_ph\in T^*\mathbb{R}^n$ ) so that, for $$(\psi_1(t),\dots,\psi_n(t),R_1,\dots,R_n)\in i(M)$$ we have that $(R_1,\dots,R_n)-d_{\psi(t)}h$ is an element of $N_{\psi(t)}(M)$ . Denoting by $d\psi$ the covector associated with $\dot\psi(t)$ , this is equivalent to $(R_1,\dots,R_n)-d_{\psi(t)}h\perp d\psi$ . Since $d\psi$ is paralell to $dh:=d_{\psi(t)}h$ , and $\vert{d\psi}\vert=1$ , this is equivalent to $$dh=\text{proj}_{d\psi}y\iff dh=(\sum_ky_k\dot\psi_k)d\psi$$ where $y=\sum_ky_kd\theta_k$ , $d\psi=\sum_k\dot\psi_k\cdot d\theta_k$ . I feel like this gets me somewhere near the identity $$\sum_{j=1}^nR^2_j\frac{\text{d}\theta_j}{\text{d}s}=\frac{\text{d}h}{\text{d}s}$$ But I am uncertain about whether my steps so far are correct, and what the full derivation looks like. I am especially concerned that $X=i(M)$ does not appear to be an affine subbundle of $T^*\mathbb{R}$ (its fibres $X_p$ are not linear subspaces of $T_p^*\mathbb{R}$ ), which seemingly contradicts Theorem 4.3.

First, set $$P^a:\mathbb{R}\longrightarrow\mathbb{R},\qquad y\mapsto\frac{1}{y^2}\left(\left(1+a_1y^2\right)\cdots\left(1+a_py^2\right)-1\right),$$ and, for $k\in\{1,\dots,n\}$ , $$r^a_k:\mathbb{R}\longrightarrow\mathbb{R},\qquad y\longmapsto\sqrt{a_k^{-1}+y^2},$$ as well as $$\theta^a_k:\mathbb{R}\longrightarrow\mathbb{R},\qquad y\longmapsto a_k\int_0^y\frac{\text{d}y}{(1+a_ky^2)\sqrt{P^a(y)}}$$ Then we define $z^a_k:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{C}$ as follows, interpreting $(r^a_k,\theta^a_k)$ as polar coordinates; $$z^a_k:\mathbb{R}\longrightarrow\mathbb{C},\qquad y\longmapsto r_k(y)\cdot e^{i\cdot\theta^a_k(y)}.$$ We now use the functions $z^a_k$ to define the following submanifold of $\mathbb{C}^n$ ; $$M_a=\left\{(t_k\cdot z^a_k(y))\in\mathbb{C}^n:y,t_k\in\mathbb{R},\sum_kt_k^2=1\right\}.$$ We call $M_a$ a Lawlor neck . $\diamond$","My concrete questions are (for context see below): Is is true that as below embeds in ?

1,Diffeomorphisms of Spheres and Real Projective Spaces,Diffeomorphisms of Spheres and Real Projective Spaces,,In the comments to Mapping torus of orientation reversing isometry of the sphere it was stated that there are only two $ S^n $ bundles over $ S^1 $ up to diffeomorphism. The conversation related to this led me to wonder several things: Is every $ \mathbb{RP}^n $ bundle over $ S^1 $ trivial? Every diffeomorphism of the sphere is either homotopic to the identity or to an orientation reversing isometry. Is every diffeomorphism of even dimensional real projective space homotopic to the identity and every diffeomorphism of odd dimensional projective space is homotopic to either the identity or to an orientation reversing isometry? I expect the answer to my first question is yes for even $ n $ and no for odd $ n $ . Basically because there are exactly 2 sphere bundles over the circle one the mapping torus of orientation preserving maps (the trivial bundle) and one for orientation reversing maps (the non trivial bundle). So importing that intuition to the case of $ RP^n $ then the orientable $ RP^n $ should have two bundles over the circle and the non orientable should have just one. For $ n=1 $ this checks out since that projective space is orientable and thus we have exactly two bundles over the circle (the trivial one/ the 2 torus and the nontrivial one/ the Klein bottle).,In the comments to Mapping torus of orientation reversing isometry of the sphere it was stated that there are only two bundles over up to diffeomorphism.

Let $g$ be a metric on $M$ ( $\nabla$ may not be the Levi-Civita connection of $g$ ). Suppose that $$ (\nabla_X g)(Y,Z)-(\nabla_Y g)(X,Z)=0. $$ Does $\nabla$ receive a special name? Or does it imply $\nabla$ is related with the Levi-Civita connection or any other thing stronger than the above relation itself? Maybe the existence of some coordinates, I don't know. I ask this because in Dombrowski's paper On the geometry of the Tangent Bundle , it is proved that the presymplectic form defined as $$\omega(X,Y)=g_S(X,JY),$$ where $J$ is the canonical complex form on $TM$ defined using the split induceb by $\nabla$ and $g_S$ denotes the Sasaki metric defined in terms of the same split and the metric $g$ , is closed whenever $\nabla$ is the Levi-Civita connection. However, the computation for the general case shows that the $d\omega$ is proportional to the above factors when evaluated on some vector fields. But I'm sure the $\omega$ is closed. In fact, I would say, under certain conditions, it is the pullback of the canonical 2-form on $T^*M$ along $g$ . But I don't know exactly what conditions are necessary and if they are related to my expression above. P.S. It would be useful also to recieve some suggestions of references to be able to read about this. Addendum 1. I typed the question on the phone. Let me describe in detail Dombrowski's construction now I have a computer avaible. It is well known every linear connection on $M$ defines an split on $TTM$ into vertical and horizontal subbundles. Each of them is isomorphic to $TM$ and for every vector field $Z\in\Gamma(TTM)$ there are vector fields $X,Y\in\Gamma(TM)$ such that $Z=X^h+Y^v$ , where the superscripts v and h denote the verticla and the horizontal litf, respectively. Hence, every tensor on $TM$ is completely characterised once we know how it acts on horizontal and vertical vector fields. Now, Dombroski defines a complex tructure $J:TTM\rightarrow TTM$ as $$JX^h, X^v, \qquad JX^v= - X^h. $$ He proves $J$ is integrable if and only if $\nabla$ is flat and torsion-free. But in the third appendix we goes beyon. The aim is to prove $TM$ is a Kähler. For that he considers a Riemannian metric $g$ on $M$ (again the flat and torsion-free connection $\nabla$ may not be the Levi-civita connection for $g$ ) and define the Sasaki metric $$ g_S(X^h,Y^h)=g_S(X^v,Y^v)= \pi_{TM}\circ g(X,Y), \qquad g_S(X^h,Y^v)=g_S(X^v,Y^h)=0 $$ (Notice I compose on the right and I denote the differential of a map $f$ as $Tf$ ). It is not difficult to see that $J$ leaves $g_S$ invariant. Hence $\omega(X,Y)=g_S(X,JY)$ is 2-form. Finally, he particularise for the case when $\nabla$ is the Levi-Civita connection for $g$ . In this case he proves $\omega$ is locally and non-locally an exact 2-form. But the computation can be done for a non-metric connection. In that case one finds the relation I have written above. Addendum 2. I claim under certain conditions, $\omega$ is the pullback along $g$ of the canonical 2-form defined on $T^*M$ . For that, let me write firstly the pullback of the canonical 1-form: $$ g^*\theta(Z)|_{p,X}= g_p(X,(T\pi)_{(p,X)}Z), \qquad Z\in T_{(p,X)}TM. $$ In coordinates $g^*\theta$ reads simply as $y_ig_{ij}d\tilde{x}_j$ . If I compute the diferential I get $$ d(g^*\theta)= -g_{ij}d\tilde{x}_i\wedge dy_j -y_i\frac{\partial g_{ij}}{\partial x_k} d\tilde{x}_i\wedge d\tilde{x}_k, $$ while $\omega$ reads in coordinates as $-g_{ij}d\tilde{x}_i\wedge dy_j$ (or the opposite, I'm not 100% sure about the sign).

7,Can anyone solve a stochastic differential equation - related to neuroscience research?,Can anyone solve a stochastic differential equation - related to neuroscience research?,,"I'm a neuroscience grad student, and I'm hoping one of ya'll could help me solve this problem regarding particle diffusion. It relates to my research on molecular-level neural plasticity, but I've framed the problem in general terms below. This will probably require you to have some experience with stochastic differential equations. Any insight is much appreciated. Thanks! The problem in a nutshell I am ultimately interested in the average steady-state particle density that can be expected in a defined region of space, when the particles are diffusing with random motions -- assume particle diffusion is Brownian motion , with zero drift, and have a constant diffusion rate coefficient. For example I'm looking for a numerical solution for the average steady-state particle density in two circular subregions with a diameter of 0.8 arbitrary units (au) contained inside a rectangular 3x6 au flat surface (these subregions are equal distance from the edges - see below). Here, let's define 1 au of distance as 1 micron (µm). In this 18 µm² space the particle diffusion coefficient is 0.1 µm²/s, except in the circular subregions; in subregion-1 the diffusion rate is 0.05 µm²/s, in subregion-2 the diffusion rate is 0.01 µm²/s. The boundary conditions can be considered 'rebound', and there are 200 total particles in this closed system. The solution should be able to generalize to any number of particles, but solving this particular situation would be great for starters. See the question visually represented here in Fig 1 along with two graphs described below. Each data-point in the graphs represent the average steady-state particle density for 10 independent simulation trials. Monte Carlo Simulation Results Figures (Fig 1) I've simulated the above scenario using Matlab. Particles diffused along the 2D surface of a closed rectangular environment that contained two equal-area subregions with a diffusion rate slightly lower than the global diffusion rate of 0.1 µm²/s. The diffusion coefficient (Dcoeff) of the bottom circular subregion was set to 0.01 µm²/s while the top subregion was set to 0.05 µm²/s. There were 500 total time-steps in each individual simulation. The heat-map seen on the right highlights regions of relatively high particle density at the end of the simulation (aka at steady-state ); which was done using matrix convolution of particle locations with a Gaussian-shaped mask (top right). Matlab code for this simulation (Fig 2) The diffusion coefficients mentioned above resulted in average steady-state particle density values that were vastly different between the two subregions, with little variance (CI envelopes reflect noise for 10 iterations). The top subregion averaged ~15 particles at steady-state (green), while to bottom region averaged ~60 particles (red). The third line (blue) represents the steady-state particle density in a circular region the same size as the two subregions, but was set to the global diffusion rate. (Fig 3) This figure shows the effects of holding the Dcoeff of one subregion constant at 0.01 µm²/s while changing the other Dcoeff from 0.01 µm²/s to 0.05 µm²/s (at 0.01 µm²/s increments). (left panel) The Dcoeff ratio at each step (calculated by simply dividing the pre-set diffusion rates of the two subregions) and the resulting steady-state particle density in each subregion are almost exactly proportional. (right panel) Interestingly, particle availability minimally affects this outcome - as the upper subregion transitioned from 0.01 µm²/s to 0.05 µm²/s it ultimately made an additional 25-30 particles available globally, but only a small portion of them accumulated in the lower subregion (which had a stable Dcoeff of 0.01 µm²/s throughout this ancillary simulation). The math question and proof of concept I believe that the particle diffusion can be summarized as Wiener process / Brownian motion with zero drift, and the Kolmogorov forward equation (aka Fokker Plank equation) will describe the time-evolution of the PDF for a random process. However, it's not immediately clear to me how to define the sODE (or sPDE); consequently, I don't even have a good sense of the difficulty-level of this question. Ultimately what I'm looking for, is an equation where I can enter these constants: Co (Outer box xy dimensions) Ci (Inner circle radius) Do (diffusion coefficient for Co) Di (diffusion coefficient for Ci) N (total number of particles in the closed system) And the output will provide the expected density of particles in Co and Ci at steady-state. Note that I'm also interested in the rate of change in these values if suddenly D changes from 0.01 µm²/s to 0.05 µm²/s , but first things first. I believe the steady-state diffusion equation will be of use: ∇D(r)∇n(r)=0 with spatially dependent diffusion coefficient D(r) and prescribed total particle number N=∫n(r)dr If you have an answer, please use an example showing the input/output. I would like to test it against the Monte Carlo simulation to be convinced. If the fact that the two-dimensional geometry has no special symmetry (which prevents a closed-form solution), feel free to just cut the system in half, such that we are only considering the bottom 3x3 square with the circular subregion directly in the center. In fact, if it makes it significantly easier, the outer container can be circular as well. Again, any help is much appreciated!

I'm failing here. Suppose $\alpha$ is a $\bf T$-helix. Then exists a constant non-zero vector $\bf v$, and a constant $c$ such that $\langle {\bf T}(s), {\bf v}\rangle = c$. Taking derivatives, we have $\langle {\bf N}(s), {\bf v}\rangle = 0$. If we differentiate this again, we conclude nothing, because in the end, we're just multiplying the last expression by $\tau(s)$. It is easy to check, by applying the Lorentzian inner product with $\bf T, N$ and $\bf B$, that: $${\bf v} =  \langle{\bf T}(s), {\bf v}\rangle {\bf T}(s) + \langle{\bf B}(s), {\bf v}\rangle {\bf N}(s) + \langle{\bf N}(s), {\bf v}\rangle {\bf B}(s)$$ So, in our situation, we have that: $${\bf v} = c {\bf T}(s) + \langle{\bf B}(s), {\bf v}\rangle {\bf N}(s)$$ Differentiating this, we get $0 = 0$, that is, nothing. Can someone help me out of this trap?",,"['differential-geometry', 'curves', 'semi-riemannian-geometry', 'frenet-frame']"
9,Relationship between radii in Riemannian manifolds,Relationship between radii in Riemannian manifolds,,"S.T. Yau raised an (somewhat) interesting question in a lecture today, which I thought I would ask for thoughts on from the good people here. The context is as follows: Consider a 3-manifold $M$ with boundary and $\sigma$ be a loop that bounds a disk in $M$ . Then we define the radius $\text{Rad}(M)$ of $M$ as: $$ \text{Rad}(M):=\sup_{\sigma}\inf\big\{\epsilon>0 \ \big| \ [\sigma]=0\in\pi_1(T_{\epsilon}(\sigma)) \big\}, $$ where $T_{\epsilon}(\sigma)$ is the $\epsilon$ -tubular neighborhood around $\sigma$ . It turns out that this is useful for estimating the first eigenvalue of an operator important in GR: Thm: (See Prop. 1, Schoen-Yau (1983) ) Suppose $M$ is a Riemannian 3-manifold and $\Omega\subset M$ is a bounded domain. Then the first eigenvalue of $-\nabla+\tfrac{R}{2}$ satisfies: $$ \lambda_1\leq \frac{2}{3\pi\cdot\text{Rad}^2(\Omega)}. $$ At any rate, Yau remarked that one could, of course, generalize this definition by replacing loops with higher-dimensional spheres: We define the $i$ -radius $\text{Rad}_i(M)$ of $M$ as: $$ \text{Rad}_i(M):=\sup_{\sigma}\inf\big\{\epsilon>0 \ \big| \ [\sigma]=0\in\pi_i(T_{\epsilon}(\sigma)) \big\}, $$ Then the question is: $\fbox{$\textbf{Q: What relationship, if any, is there between the various } \text{Rad}_i(M)?$}$ Thoughts?

12,Nowhere vanishing magnetic helicity,Nowhere vanishing magnetic helicity,,"Suppose you are given a nowhere-vanishing exact 2-form $B=dA$ on an open, connected domain $D\subset\mathbb{R}^3$. I'd like to think of $B$ as a magnetic field. Consider the product $H(A)=A\wedge dA$. At least in the plasma physics literature, $H(A)$ is known as the magnetic helicity density. How can one determine if there is a closed one-form $\mathbf{s}$ such that $H(A+\mathbf{s})$ is non-zero at all points in $D$? The reason I am interested in this question is that if you can find such an $\mathbf{s}$, then  $A+\mathbf{s}$ will define a contact structure on $D$ whose Reeb vector field gives the magnetic field lines. Thus, the question is closely related to the Hamiltonian structure of magnetic field line dynamics. I'll elaborate on this last point a bit. If there is a vector potential $A$ such that $A\wedge dA$ is non-zero everywhere, then the distribution $\xi=\text{ker}(A)$ is nowhere integrable, meaning $\xi$ defines a contact structure on $D$ with a global contact 1-form $A$. The Reeb vector field of this contact structure relative to the contact form $A$ is the unique vector field $X$ that satisfies $A(X)=1$ and $\text{i}_XdA=0$. Using the standard volume form $\mu_o$, $dA$ can be expressed as $\text{i}_{\mathbf{B}}\mu_o$ for a unique divergence-free vector field $\mathbf{B}$. Thus, the second condition on the Reeb vector field can be expressed as $\mathbf{B}\times X=0$, which implies the integral curves of $X$ coincide with the magnetic field lines. An example where $D=$3-ball and no $\mathbf{s}$ can exist: Let $D$ consist of those points in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with $x^2+y^2 < a^2$ for a real number $a>1$. Note that all closed 1-forms are exact in this case. Let $f:[0,\infty)\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ be a smooth, non-decreasing function such that $f(r)=0$ for $r<1/10$ and $f(r)=1$ for $r\ge1/2$. Let $g:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be the polynomial $g(r)=1-3r+2r^2$. Define the 2-form $B$ using the divergence free vector field $\mathbf{B}(x,y,z)=f(\sqrt{x^2+y^2})e_\phi(x,y,z)+g(\sqrt{x^2+y^2})e_z$. Here $e_\phi$ is the azimuthal unit vector and $e_z$ is the $z$-directed unit vector. It is easy to verify that $B$, thus defined, is an exact 2-form that is nowhere vanishing. Because $g(1)=0$ and $f(1)=1$, the circle, $C$, in the $z=0$-plane, $x^2+y^2=1$, is an integral curve for the vector field $\mathbf{B}$. I will use this fact to prove that the helicity density must have a zero for any choice of gauge. Let $A$ satisfy $dA=B$ and suppose $A\wedge B$ is non-zero at all points in $D$. Note that $A\wedge B=A(\mathbf{B})\mu_o$, meaning $h=A(\mathbf{B})$ is a nowhere vanishing function. Without loss of generality, I will assume $h>0$. Thus, the line integral $I=\oint_C h\frac{dl}{|\mathbf{B}|}$ satisfies $I>0$. But, by Stoke's theorem, $I=2\pi\int_0^1g(r)rdr=0$, as is readily verified by directly evaluating the integral.

The proof relies on on the assertion that this is true for $G = \mathrm{SU}(2)$ . However I calculated that with this construction of $\sigma$ the result is $$ \int_{\mathrm{SU}(2)} \sigma = 48 \pi^2. $$ Therefore I think the value at the identity should be modified to $$ \sigma(\xi, \eta, \zeta) = \frac{1}{4 8 \pi^2} \langle [\xi , \eta], \zeta \rangle, $$ and then the argument in the book goes through.

This representation will be explained through an example [with a certain similarity with the example given in the reference] in order to convey easily the underlying ideas.

We see regions with two or four real roots, exceptionnaly 3. The eye is attracted by the generated ""interweaved"" curves that will be analyzed later on. Fig. 1 : The ""3 roots"" case corresponds to places of bifurcation (little red circles) where 2 formerly distinct real roots coalesce, then ""disappear"" ; or, in a reverse way, appear ""from scratch"".

Instead of having a real-valued axis for $\lambda$ , we switch to a ""complex valued axis"", more precisely, we replace a single axis by two of them, one for the real part, the other one for the imaginary part. As complex eigenvalues come by conjugate pairs (the polynomials we consider have real coefficients),  Fig. 2 is symmetrical with respect to the horizontal plane defined by $a$ and $\Re(\lambda)$ axes. In this way, we can ""track"" the roots and understand in a finer way what happens for certain values of the parameter. Our understanding of Fig. 1 can be refined : see Appendix below. Fig. 2.

Appendix : A deeper understanding of Fig. 1: The two ""complex domain curves"" (red, and magenta for their complex conjugate parts) are on the right, a parabolic arc, thus planar, whereas, on the left, the ellipse-looking curve is not planar. Consider now the (blue) real components (the straight line, and the two curves of the horizontal plane); let us play a game of anticipation: for the straight line, we guess the presence of a root $\lambda=-2.$ for the two curves, it is natural to consider them together as having the same equation with a common horizontal asymptote for a certain value (of course never reached) of $\lambda$ .  Zooming, one can guess that this asymptote is characterized by $\lambda_{\infty}=2.5$ , Besides, a little observation makes evident a parabolic envelope ; gathering these observations, a possible equation for $a$ as a function of $\lambda$ is as follows : $$\tag{1}a = p\lambda^2+ q\lambda +r+\dfrac{s}{\lambda-2.5}.$$ for certain coefficients $p,q,r,s$ . It remains to check (1) by examining the factorization of the characteristic polynomial of $A$ and then its roots. Using a CAS, or by hand calculation, we obtain: $$\tag{2}\det(A-\lambda I)=(\lambda+2)P(\lambda) \ \ \ \ \text{with} \ \ \ \ P(\lambda):=\lambda^3+\lambda^2-8\lambda+2a \lambda+3-5a$$ Equating (2) to zero, we obtain $\lambda=-2$ , as awaited, or $P(\lambda)=0$ , which can be written in the following equivalent way : $$a=\dfrac{-\lambda^3-\lambda^2+8\lambda-3}{2 \lambda -5}$$ in full conformity with form (1).","Answering, some time ago, to this question : Change in eigenvalues on changing one entry of a matrix , I had the idea of a graphical representation of roots of polynomial equations such as [In fact, I will use notation , because we can assume WLOG that such polynomials can always be considered as characteristic polynomials of certain matrices whose coefficients are polynomials in (companion matrix for example).] The idea I have had is to build a simultaneous graphical representation of real and complex roots of displaying their global dependency on real parameter (see Fig. 2).

Appendix : A deeper understanding of Fig. 1: The two ""complex domain curves"" (red, and magenta for their complex conjugate parts) are on the right, a parabolic arc, thus planar, whereas, on the left, the ellipse-looking curve is not planar. Consider now the (blue) real components (the straight line, and the two curves of the horizontal plane); let us play a game of anticipation: for the straight line, we guess the presence of a root for the two curves, it is natural to consider them together as having the same equation with a common horizontal asymptote for a certain value (of course never reached) of .  Zooming, one can guess that this asymptote is characterized by , Besides, a little observation makes evident a parabolic envelope ; gathering these observations, a possible equation for as a function of is as follows : for certain coefficients . It remains to check (1) by examining the factorization of the characteristic polynomial of and then its roots. Using a CAS, or by hand calculation, we obtain: Equating (2) to zero, we obtain , as awaited, or , which can be written in the following equivalent way : in full conformity with form (1).","P(x,a)=P_{a}(x) \in \mathbb{R}[a,x]=\mathbb{R}[a][x], x^3+a x^2+(2a+1)x-3a=0. \lambda:=x a \lambda_1,\lambda_2 ... \lambda_n P_a(\lambda)=0 a A=\left(\begin{array}{rrrr}1&  3&  0& -2\\

27,Modified Willmore energy and surfaces with infinitesimally narrow necks,Modified Willmore energy and surfaces with infinitesimally narrow necks,,"There is an open problem in theoretical biophysics that I think has a strong mathematical flavour, and I have always thought that mathematicians would be interested in it. I would like to hear your ideas on the problem. In the biophysics literature, cellular membranes are typically modelled using what is called the bending energy or Helfrich energy,  $$ E = \int (H - H_0)^2 \mathrm{d}A $$ where $H$ is the mean curvature of the surface. The constant $H_0$ is called the ""spontaneous curvature"", and represents the preferred curvature of the membrane, arising from an asymmetry between the two sides of the membrane. In the absence of asymmetries, $H_0=0$ and we recover the usual Willmore energy. I have also omitted a term related to the Gaussian curvature, because we will only deal with closed surfaces of fixed topology, and then the term becomes irrelevant through the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. Furthermore, the total area and enclosed volume of the surface are also constrained in practical situations, so that one has to minimize the bending energy of the surface for fixed area $A$ and volume $V$. Without loss of generality, one can fix $A=4 \pi$, and the minimum energy shapes will depend on two parameters, $H_0$ and $V$. For a surface of genus $0$, we have necessarily that $0 \leq V \leq 4 \pi /3$, with $V=4 \pi / 3$ corresponding to a sphere, and $V<4 \pi /3$ necessarily deviating from a sphere. Now here comes the mathematically interesting bit: among the many shapes that minimize the bending energy above for given $H_0$ and $V$, it was found from numerical minimization of axisymmetric shapes [1,2] that there exist minimum energy shapes corresponding to two separate shapes that are connected to each other via an infinitesimally narrow neck, in practice tangentially ""kissing"" at a single point. The infinitesimally narrow neck costs zero bending energy (its Gaussian curvature tends to infinity but its mean curvature stays finite), so the total energy is just the sum of the energies of each individual shape. These limit shapes were found to always satisfy the kissing condition $$ H_1 + H_2 = 2H_0 $$ where $H_1$ and $H_2$ are the mean curvatures of each of the two shapes at the kissing point. Two examples, corresponding to the particular case of kissing spheres, are illustrated in this image: In the example on the left, the shape would be a minimum energy solution for $1/R_1 + 1/R_2 = 2 H_0$. The shape would be a boundary minimum of the energy for $1/R_1 + 1/R_2 < 2 H_0$, and a similar shape with a small but finite neck would be a solution for $1/R_1 + 1/R_2 \gtrsim 2 H_0$. In the example on the right, the shape would be a minimum energy solution for $1/R_1 - 1/R_2 = 2 H_0$. The shape would be a boundary minimum of the energy for $1/R_1 - 1/R_2 > 2 H_0$, and a similar shape with a small but finite neck would be a solution for $1/R_1 - 1/R_2 \lesssim 2 H_0$. In both examples, the radii $R_1$ and $R_2$ are such that the constraints on the area and volume of the shape are satisfied. A particularly interesting case occurs for $H_0 = 0$, i.e. for the standard Willmore energy, where the kissing condition becomes $H_1 = -H_2$. In particular, the minimum bending energy shape for zero volume $V=0$ is composed of two nested spheres of equal radius connected to each other by an infinitesimal neck, with total energy $E=8\pi$. The kissing condition $H_1 + H_2 = 2 H_0$ was later analytically proven [3] for axisymmetric shapes (i.e. two axisymmetric shapes connected to each other by a neck at their axis of symmetry) of genus $0$, but it is still not known whether it holds for non-axisymmetric shapes or shapes of higher genus . Furthermore, the proof for axisymmetric shapes in [3] was quite complicated, and no simpler proofs have been given since. Two interesting observations are (i) that the kissing condition implies $(H_1 - H_0)^2 = (H_2 - H_0)^2$, that is, the bending energy density is equal on both sides of the neck, and (ii) that if we take the mean curvature at the neck to interpolate between the mean curvatures on both sides of the neck, i.e. $H_\mathrm{neck} \equiv (H_1+H_2)/2$, then the kissing condition implies that $H_\mathrm{neck} = H_0$ Furthermore, the neck condition has been extended [4] (heuristically, based on numerical results) to surfaces composed of two separate ""domains"" of fixed area, with a line energy that penalizes the length $L$ of the boundary between the two domains, $E_\lambda = \lambda L$. If the two domains have distinct spontaneous curvatures $H_{0,1}$ and $H_{0,2}$, one then finds the kissing condition $H_1 + H_2 = H_{0,1}+H_{0,2}  \pm \lambda$, with the plus and minus signs corresponding to the left and right situations in the image above. So, my questions to you are: Have you ever heard of this kissing condition, and the corresponding open problem of proving whether it holds for non-axisymmetric and higher genus shapes? Is there any mathematical literature on this problem that might have gone unnoticed to me and other physicists? Do you have any intuition on how it could be proven, or whether it will or won't hold in non-axisymmetric situations? Do you think mathematicians could/should get interested in it? [1] U. Seifert, K.

I was wondering if anybody can show me a proof of this because I have had difficulty finding one. Thank you!,,"['differential-geometry', 'riemannian-geometry']"
