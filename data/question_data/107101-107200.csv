1,The average area of the shadow of a square,The average area of the shadow of a square,,"This question comes from my attempt at solving the problem of the average area of a cube in an unconventional way. As the shadow of the cube is comprised of the shadows of 3 of its square faces, I am attempting to calculate the average area of each of those squares' shadows, multiply it by three, and arrive at the answer of $\frac{3s^2}{2}$ . That means that the average area of the shadow of a square should be $\frac{s^2}{2}$ , which makes intuitive sense, but I want to prove it mathematically, which I am having difficulty doing. Here's my work so far: Consider a square $\mathrm{S}$ with side lengths $s$ that is lifted up in both the $\mathrm{x}$ and $\mathrm{y}$ directions by $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ degrees respectfully. Then, for these $\theta$ values, the area of the square becomes $s^2\mathrm{cos}\theta_1\mathrm{cos}\theta_2$ , as can be determined by trigonometry (a right triangle with a hypotenuse of $s$ , angle $\theta$ , and side $x$ adjacent to the angle gives $x=s\mathrm{cos}\theta$ ). The median value of $\mathrm{cos}\theta$ on the interval $[0, \pi/2]$ is $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ (appearing at $\frac{\pi}{4}$ ). Here's the part I don't fully understand: Let $\mathrm{A(S_{(\theta_a, \theta_b)})}$ be a function of a square $\mathrm{S}$ that has been lifted by $\theta_a$ and $\theta_b$ on the $\mathrm{x}$ -axis and $\mathrm{y}$ -axis respectively. To find the average area of this square, we can do the following: $$\frac{\iint_R \mathrm{A(S_{(\theta_a, \theta_b)})}dA}{R_{area}}, \{R\in\mathbb{R}^2 \vert R = [0,\frac{\pi}{2}] \times [\frac{\pi}{2}]\} \\ = \frac{s^2\int_0^{\pi/2}\int_0^{\pi/2}\mathrm{cos}\theta_1\mathrm{cos}\theta_2d\theta_1d\theta_2}{\frac{\pi^2}{4}} \\ = \frac{4s^2}{\pi^2}$$ This does not yield the result I'm looking for, so I'm wondering where I messed in my logical deduction. Can I just take the median value of $\mathrm{cos}x$ over $[0,\frac{\pi}{2}]$ ? If so, that removes the need for the integral, but it seems to simple, and doesn't explain why the two contradict each other. Thanks in advance.","This question comes from my attempt at solving the problem of the average area of a cube in an unconventional way.

The feeling is that there are no more examples with rational area (actually, I learned recently about the dodecagon and I found it quite surprising), but I don't know anything about a proof.

The cross product yields the axis of rotation, so to then form the normal at the point for time value $t$ I take the cross product of the axis of rotation, and the original derivative vector, since these three vectors are by definition perpendicular.

Even in fast-changing curves, the angle between two ""reasonable"" normals is a relatively small value, so if the angle suddenly flips to ""nearly $\pi$ "" then as of that time value the ""desired normals"" are negative actual normal.

82,Ball rolling along a see-saw,Ball rolling along a see-saw,,"Suppose we have a see-saw which is 2 metres long, whose mid-point is connected to a fulcrum which is 0.5 metres tall. The see-saw has a mass of 1kg, and has uniform thickness and density. The see-saw starts with one side up, and hence has a slope of 30 degrees (or pi/6 radians). You place a ball of mass $m$ on top of the see-saw. It starts rolling down the see-saw, but as it rolls, it starts pushing that side of the see-saw down. If the ball is too light, the see-saw will not swivel much and the ball will roll off the right hand side of the see-saw. If the ball is too heavy, the ball won't roll much, and instead will push the see-saw down quickly, and will end up rolling off the left hand side of the see saw. The question is: what must the mass of the ball be such that it gets stuck in a dynamic equilibrium. That is, for the first phase (up until the ball reaches the fulcrum) the ball's gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy both of the ball, and of the see-saw. When the ball is at the fulcrum, the see-saw is perfectly flat and the ball and see-saw have both reached their maximum velocity. In the second phase, the ball starts rolling up the right hand side of the see-saw.  The right side of the see saw is still swivelling up, although it's slowing down as the ball presses on it. The ball reaches the top of the see-saw, and then starts rolling down again; repeating the process. NB Assume no friction or air resistance. Model the see-saw as being arbitrarily thin. Neglect the rotational energy of the ball (ie assume the ball is a point mass). I have not attempted to solve this problem analytically (this would require differential equations, I'd imagine). I have used a spreadsheet model, though, to determine that the mass of the ball should be about 0.13 kg, in which case it reaches the fulcrum at around t=0.7 seconds (this was with a model in which time has a 'granularity' of 0.01 seconds). Bonus points: Determine the curve that the ball traces. I think it should be a parabola.","Suppose we have a see-saw which is 2 metres long, whose mid-point is connected to a fulcrum which is 0.5 metres tall.

If the ball is too light, the see-saw will not swivel much and the ball will roll off the right hand side of the see-saw. If the ball is too heavy, the ball won't roll much, and instead will push the see-saw down quickly, and will end up rolling off the left hand side of the see saw. The question is: what must the mass of the ball be such that it gets stuck in a dynamic equilibrium. That is, for the first phase (up until the ball reaches the fulcrum) the ball's gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy both of the ball, and of the see-saw. When the ball is at the fulcrum, the see-saw is perfectly flat and the ball and see-saw have both reached their maximum velocity. In the second phase, the ball starts rolling up the right hand side of the see-saw.  The right side of the see saw is still swivelling up, although it's slowing down as the ball presses on it. The ball reaches the top of the see-saw, and then starts rolling down again; repeating the process. NB Assume no friction or air resistance. Model the see-saw as being arbitrarily thin. Neglect the rotational energy of the ball (ie assume the ball is a point mass). I have not attempted to solve this problem analytically (this would require differential equations, I'd imagine). I have used a spreadsheet model, though, to determine that the mass of the ball should be about 0.13 kg, in which case it reaches the fulcrum at around t=0.7 seconds (this was with a model in which time has a 'granularity' of 0.01 seconds). Bonus points: Determine the curve that the ball traces. I think it should be a parabola.",,"['calculus', 'geometry', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'physics', 'curves']"

I've used homogeneous coordinates to represent translations using transform matrices, but nothing else. I had an idea a couple of days ago (relating to optimization) which seems to require points at infinity. But I immediately ran into problems. As soon as I sat down and thought through what points of infinity actually are, I found what seemed like a fundamental problem with my understanding - it contradicts Euclid's axioms. I knew I had an old book that covers the subject, so I went back to that and checked. That didn't resolve the issue, it just allowed me to state the contradiction (hopefully) more clearly. So - the book is Applied Geometry for Computer Graphics and CAD, by Duncan Marsh, ISBN 1-85233-080-5, first edition, published by Springer-Verlag in 1999. Chapter 2 is 'Homogeneous Coordinates and Transformations of the Plane'. The almost complete first paragraph of section 2.2 'Points at Infinity' is... Homogeneous coordinates of the form $(x, y, 0)$ do not correspond to a   point in the Cartesian plane, but represent the unique point at   infinity in the direction $(x \; y)$. To justify this remark, consider   the line $(x(t),y(t)) = (tx + a,ty + b)$ through the point $(a, b)$   with direction $(x \; y)$. The point $(tx + a, ty + b)$ has   homogeneous coordinates $(tx + a,ty + b, 1)$ and multiplying through   by $1/t$ (for $t \neq 0$) gives alternative homogeneous coordinates   $(x + a/t,y + b/t, 1/t)$. Points on the line an infinite distance away   from the origin in the Cartesian plane may be obtained by letting $t$   tend to infinity. The limiting point of $(x + a/t,y + b/t, 1/t)$ as $t > \to \infty$ is $(x, y, 0)$. Therefore, it is natural to interpret the   homogeneous coordinates $(x, y, 0)$ as the point at infinity in the   direction $(x, y)$. Limits sometimes worry me. The limit of a function that approximates another function at a given point is often taken as the value of the function being approximated at that given point, but that can lead to non-unique values and to contradictions. An example is the tangent of 90 degrees - take the limit of an approximation and you get either $+\infty$ or $-\infty$ depending on which side you build your approximation function to approach from. Here, Marsh takes a formula along one particular line, takes a limit, and declares that the result is the ""point at infinity"", in doing so implying that the homogeneous coordinates resulting from that limit represent that ""point at infinity"" uniquely. I don't believe that's true. I believe that even though that formula describes the points along a line, the limit isn't a point at all - it's a direction. Which doesn't mean it's not a useful concept, but it does seem important to have the right intuitions. But first, I claimed a contradiction with Euclid's axioms... The relevant axioms are usually listed as the first two... A unique line segment can be drawn between any two distinct points. Any finite straight line segment can be extended indefinitely, to form a unique infinite line. The point is that although Marsh only discusses taking $t \to +\infty$, it's just as valid to take $t \to -\infty$. Obviously if an unbounded line has any points at infinity, it has two. And two points are exactly what you need by Euclid's axioms to define a unique line. I list Euclid's second axiom only to assert that those lines drawn from distinct finite points aren't somehow distinct from those drawn between distinct points at infinity (presumably the justification for evaluating points at infinity from that limit). However, any two parallel lines - with emphasis on distinct parallel lines - have the same two points at infinity. By Euclid's axioms, that apparently means they're all the same line after all - any straight line is a space-filling curve. That's clearly absurd. The claim that the result from the limit uniquely identifies a point at infinity is then almost immediately used to justify the claim that any pair of parallel lines has a unique intersection at infinity. As far as I'm aware this is a standard use for points at infinity using homogeneous coordinates. But if distinct parallel lines really are distinct, I believe I've just proven that the homogeneous coordinates of a point at infinity do not uniquely identify a point at infinity. Distinct parallel lines share the same two ""point at infinity"" homogeneous vectors but aren't the same line. Those two opposite ""point at infinity"" vectors are not sufficient information to uniquely identify one line. If a line is to be drawn between two ""point at infinity"" homogeneous vectors, those vectors don't contain sufficient information to identify which particular line. An alternative argument is basically to forget Marshes limit and look at the the parallel lines themselves. The distance between them is constant, no matter how far along them you travel. Even at infinity, the distance between them is unchanged. Therefore, they don't intersect. So in short, I'm claiming that... Homogeneous coordinate vectors in which the ""extra"" ordinate is zero represent directions, not (absolute or relative) positions, in the underlying non-homogeneous space. I think of the extra ordinate as representing sensitivity to translation - the idea that directions (without magnitude) are insensitive to translation seems very reasonable, and this fits with that limit ""forgetting"" which particular parallel line it approaches infinity along. A point and a direction is sufficient to uniquely define a line. Two precisely opposite directions (the two directions along the same line) give no more information than just one direction, and are not sufficient to uniquely identify a line. With no reason to ""miss"" the origin, it might be tempting to draw the line through the origin, but all the parallel lines have equal claim to be ""the"" line with that direction. Rather than being able to drawn lines between any two arbitrary ""points at infinity"", lines with two distinct non-opposite directions are self-contradictions. Parallel lines don't intersect, not even at either or both of their respective infinities. If points at infinity exist as actual points, they cannot be uniquely identified purely by homogeneous coordinates that describe translation-insensitive directions. Have I made some stupid error in this? (I don't think so, but then I never do at the time). Has Marsh misled me? When points at infinity are used correctly , do Euclids axioms need to be worded slightly differently than I have them? Is the name ""points at infinity"" just a name that shouldn't be taken too literally for something that's really just a direction? BTW - I don't think this breaks my idea - a direction as a ""point at infinity"" should be fine just so long as I'm clear what I can do with that direction - what makes geometric sense and what doesn't. The idea itself is far too obvious to be original, but I want to work it out for myself. I've held back from adding extra tags (e.s.p. homogeneous-spaces) because I'm not sure they're appropriate.","I've known about homogeneous coordinates and points at infinity for a very long time, but never had much reason to use them.

The $70\%$ of the full note can consist of at-most two pieces. The two pieces are glued together, and agree on their boundary. Let us assume that each complete note is $100\%$ identical. (To avoid identification codes etc). Can we generate new valid currency by cutting up full $\$50$ notes? If not, what is the largest percentage of the full note (as opposed to $70\%$) that would allow us to generate new currency. Evidently if $70\%$ was changed to $50\%$, we could just cut any note into halves, and obtain two valid notes. Side note: I don't plan to deface currency, which is illegal, this is just a curiosity, that I couldn't solve as of yet.","Consider the following problem: A $\$50$ is still considered valid currency if you have $70\%$ of the full note.

96,Integral of $\prod_{i=1}^n (\mathbf{x}\cdot \mathbf{u_i})\ \mathrm{d}\mathbf{x}$ over the ($n-1$)-sphere.,Integral of  over the ()-sphere.,\prod_{i=1}^n (\mathbf{x}\cdot \mathbf{u_i})\ \mathrm{d}\mathbf{x} n-1,"In a physics problem I encountered, it was necessary to calculate $$\int_{S} (\mathbf{x}\cdot\mathbf{a})(\mathbf{x}\cdot\mathbf{b})d\mathbf{x},$$ where the integral ranges over the surface of the sphere. This can be bashed out with spherical coordinates, and it equals $$\frac{4\pi}{3} (\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b}).$$ Is there a ""nice"" way to do this integral in the general case where we have $m$ vectors in $\mathbb{R^n}$ and integrate over the $(n-1)$-sphere? My hunch is that, if $m=2$, we should have that the integral should be the volume of the unit $n$-ball times $\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b}$, but I'm not sure what it should be with more than $2$ vectors.","In a physics problem I encountered, it was necessary to calculate $$\int_{S} (\mathbf{x}\cdot\mathbf{a})(\mathbf{x}\cdot\mathbf{b})d\mathbf{x},$$ where the integral ranges over the surface of the sphere.

Below is a representation of the image provided. After searching around and debating it, we came up with nothing. A polygon is defined as ""consisting of a number of points and an equal number of line segments, with no three successive points collinear"". But the question clearly stated ""shape"" and not polygon. Because of this, we're pretty stumped. We then concluded on the proposition that this would have to depend on whether or not you were taught if lines have 1 or 2 sides. a pentagon lollipop","So this came up tonight with a friend while we were studying, he had an old SAT question that asked ""How many sides does this shape have?"".
