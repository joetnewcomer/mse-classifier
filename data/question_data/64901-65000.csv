0,Number of zeros in Fibonacci sequences mod $p$,Number of zeros in Fibonacci sequences mod,p,"We know that Fibonacci sequences are periodic in mod $m$. For example, for  $p\equiv \pm 1 \pmod 5$ and $p\equiv \pm 2 \pmod 5$ the periods for Fibonacci sequences modulo $p$ divide $p-1$ and $2p+2$ respectively.

1,Find the Generating Function with respect to n,Find the Generating Function with respect to n,,"The following is a problem from Chapter 2 of Herbert Wilf's generatingfunctionology : Let $S$ and $T$ be two fixed sets of nonnegative integers.

17,Counting Balanced Brackets with a twist,Counting Balanced Brackets with a twist,,"I have $n$ ""1""s written as a sum: $1+1+1+\dots+1$, and proceed to add some brackets to the sum. Call the modified sum ""good"" if the brackets are balanced and not redundant*. [Since in fact placing any brackets is redundant, redundancy here is limited to brackets around a single ""1"", that is $(1)$ and more than one pair of brackets around the same sum, such as $((1+1))$.] For example, if $ n = 4 $, then $$(1+1)+(1+1)$$ $$(1+1+1)+1$$ $$(1+(1+1)+1)$$ are all good. The full list (as far as I can see) of good sums for $n=4$ is 1+1+1+1, 1+1+(1+1), 1+(1+1+1), 1+(1+(1+1)), 1+((1+1)+1), (1+1+1)+1, (1+(1+1))+1, ((1+1)+1)+1, (1+1)+1+1, (1+1)+(1+1), and all those sums with an outermost pair of brackets added. Edit : I missed out one of the good sums, namely 1+(1+1)+1 . How many good sums are there for each $n$? My attempt at a solution is as follows. First, let a ""spanning bracket pair"" be a pair of open and close brackets that include the entire sum; for example $(1+1+1+1)$ contains a spanning bracket pair. Let $a_n$ and $b_n$ be respectively the number of sums for each $n$ with and without a spanning bracket pair respectively, and $c_n=a_n+b_n$. For convenience, we define $a_0=0, b_0=0$ For $n=1$, $a_1=0, b_1=1$, and for $n\geq 2$, $a_n=b_n$. Edit : My initial recurrence relation was far more complicated than it had to be. The edited recurrence relation is as follows. To set up a recurrence relation for $b_n$, we note that all good sums without a spanning bracket pair of length $n$ can be classified into exactly two types: those with an initial open bracket $($, and those without. To count the number with an initial open bracket $($, we split each of the sums into two good sub-sums such that the first sum has a spanning bracket pair. For example, the sum (1+1)+1+(1+1) would be split into (1+1) and 1+(1+1) . The number of sums with an initial open bracket is then just $$a_2c_{n-2}+a_3c_{n-3}+a_4c{n_4}+\dots+a_{n-1}c_1=\sum_{i=2}^{n-1} a_ic_{n-i}$$ To count the number without an initial open bracket, we note that by removing the leading $1+$ term, we are simply left with a good sum of length $n-1$ (that may or may not have a spanning bracket pair). Thus, the number of such terms is simply $$c_{n-1}$$ Thus, the required relation is just $$b_n=c_{n-1}+\sum_{i=2}^{n-1} a_ic_{n-i}=\sum_{1=2}^{n-1} b_ic_{n-i}$$ Since $a_n=b_n$ for $n=2$, while $b_1=1$. Calculating a few initial terms, I found that the values of $c_n$ were $1, 2, 6, 22, 90, 394, 1806, \dots$ and plugging this into OEIS as suggested, I found that this was just A006318 , the large Schroeder numbers. At the moment, though, I'm still trying to figure out how to produce the generating function for the large Schroeder numbers from this recurrence.

For a time parameter varying from $0$ to $1$ , every figure $\mathcal{P}_{n,m}$ rotates around the point $(n,m)$ in the positive direction, each with its own non-negative speed, so that the following two conditions are satisfied: Two distinct figures can intersect (touch) only at the boundary; At the time moment $1$ , every figure has made a full $360^{\circ}$ turn.

This problem occurred to me while working on the paper about defects and grain boundaries in tilings (the motivation comes from a study of $2D$ crystals), but it has an independent interest.

Indeed, let $ r=\big{(}1+\cos(\frac{\pi}{8})\big{)}^{-1}$ . Consider a circle (call it $\mathcal{C}$ ) of radius $r$ and centered at $(0,0)$ . Consider an octagon inscribed in $\mathcal{C}$ , as shown on the right: Let our $\mathcal{P}$ be made of this octagon with four circular segments of $\mathcal{C}$ added, as shown. To the left of $\mathcal{P}$ we have $\mathcal{P}_{-1,0}$ . The latter can make a full circle rotation, in the process just touching $\mathcal{P}$ .

Let $\vartheta$ be the unique solution to $\sin(\frac{\pi}{4}-x)=x$ .

31,Recursive coupon collector problems,Recursive coupon collector problems,,"Consider the well-known coupon collector problem with $n$ potential coupons. If I collect a coupon per day, I know it will take me $n \cdot H_n$ days to finally collect all of them, where $H_n$ is the $n$ -th harmonic number, and $H_n$ to collect each coupon on average. For example, if the coupons are the positive integers up to 12, one potential sequence of coupons could look like r1=[5     2    12     9     3     2     1     8     5     6     7    11    11    11     3     4     2     9     3     5     8    12     8     3    10] Note that for this example, it took me 25 days to collect them all, which is “kind of” close to $12 \cdot H_{12}=37$ , with an average per coupon of $t_1=|r_1|/n=25/12=2.08$ . Now, once I obtain all of the coupons, then I will observe which ones I have obtained exactly once. I will eliminate this set $k_1$ of coupons, and take a look at how long it took me to collect the remaining $n-|k_1|$ coupons this time. Note that in this process I am always eliminating the last coupon to appear, but possibly more. In the previous example, the coupons that appear once are k1=[1     4     6     7    10] which are the ones which I will remove. And the ones that can stay are b1=[2     3     5     8     9    11    12] Searching how long it took me in the initial sequence to get all the values I haven’t removed, I obtained: r2=[5     2    12     9     3     2     8     5    11] I would expect that this should have taken me on average $H_{n-|k_1|}$ days?  Here $|k_1|=5$ so this would be $H_7=2.59$ . This is not that close to the actual time that it took me, which is $t_2=|r_2|/(n-|k_1|)=9/7=1.29$ in our example. I will now check, in the second iteration, which are the coupons that I have collected exactly once, and remove them again from the sample. The coupons that appear only once are k2=[3     8     9    11    12] I remove them and obtain the shortest list that contains all elements in $[1:12]\setminus \{k_1 \cup k_2\}$ . This gives me r3=[5     2] Again, I would expect that this should have taken me on average $H_{n-|k_1|-|k_2|}$ days?  Here $|k_1|=5$ and $|k_2|=5$ , which gives $1.5$ , which is also more than what it actually took me, which was only $t_3=|r_3|/(n-|k_1|-|k_2|)=2/2=1$ day on average. In the end, I am interested in the average time it took me to take each coupon in each of the $r$ sequences, call this $T_n$ . In our example, it took me 2.08 days on average to get my first coupons in $r_1$ , this is multiplied by the number of elements that appeared only once in $r_1$ , i.e. $|k_1|=5$ . Then, it took me, on average, $1.29$ days to get each of the coupons in $r_2$ , this is multiplied by $|k_2|=5$ , and finally it took me an average of 1 day to collect each of the coupons in $r_3$ , and this is multiplied by $k_3$ . Finally, we divide all of it by $n$ . In our example, $$T_{12}=(5\cdot 2.08+5 \cdot 1.29+2\cdot 1)/12= 1.57$$ Thus, $T_n$ can be defined more generally as: $$T_n=\left[\frac{1}{n}\right]\left[\frac{|k_1||r_1|}{n}+\frac{|k_2||r_2|}{n-|k_1|}+\frac{|k_3||r_3|}{n-|k_1|-|k_2|}+\ldots\right]$$ I am interested in the approximate expected value of $T_n$ , particularly in its asymptotic behavior and upper/lower bounds. My guess was that one could approximate $T_n$ by the recursive use of the initial approximation $H_n$ , in which we fix that in each round we remove exactly one coupon. Therefore, we obtain $\frac{H_n + H_{n-1}+ \ldots}{n}$ , which asymptotically converges to $H_n$ . But, as I have shown before in the example, this approximation is not that good because the recursive approximation using $H_n$ starts getting worse and worse. In simulations, I have found the following values for $T_n$ : Vaue of n Output 25 2.1325 50 2.3378 100 2.4772 200 2.6004 500 2.7388 If it helps, note that the expected size of $k_1$ is $H_n$ , see Section 4 in Myers, Amy N., and Herbert S.

That way, by moving my 'window' I will lose one number on the left and get one new on the right. After such move, for the numbers in the 'window' to maintain divisibility by $3$ I need to add a number that shares the same group with the number that I left outside of my window. By extension, I can conclude that if I need a sequence such that the sum of every three consecutive numbers is divisible by $3$ , I have to structure every another window of 3 numbers the same way as the first one. Therefore my sequences can look like that: | $g1$ + $g1$ + $g1$ | $g1$ + $g1$ + $g1$ | $g1$ + $g1$ + $g1$ | ... | $g2$ + $g2$ + $g2$ | $g2$ + $g2$ + $g2$ | $g2$ + $g2$ + $g2$ | ... | $g3$ + $g3$ + $g3$ | $g3$ + $g3$ + $g3$ | $g3$ + $g3$ + $g3$ | ... | $g1$ + $g2$ + $g3$ | $g1$ + $g2$ + $g3$ | $g1$ + $g2$ + $g3$ | ... Now we can see that first $3$ sequences are impossible, because in my set of numbers I have $n$ elements from group $1$ , $n$ elements from group $2$ , $n$ elements from group $3$ and they all need to be placed in my sequence. Therefore the only scheme that I can use is the last one: | $g1$ + $g2$ + $g3$ | $g1$ + $g2$ + $g3$ | $g1$ + $g2$ + $g3$ | ... Now, I need to permute the places of groups in each window of $3$ numbers: that can be done in $3! = 6$ ways. Then I need to permute numbers in their groups. Therefore, ultimately, I can create $6 \cdot n! \cdot n! \cdot n!$ such sequences.

As would: { {R}, {G}, {B} } { {B}, {G}, {RB}, {RG} } { {RGB}, {R}, {BG}} { } { {RGB}, {RG}, {RB}, {GB}, {R}, {G}, {B}} The sets { {R}, {G} } and { {RGB}, {R}, {G} } would not be color balanced for n=3 , as Blue (B) fails to appear in as many color sets as Red (R) and Green (G).

The obvious brute force method is to a. enumerate all the color sets b. enumerate all sets of color sets and check each one for color balance. With this I found: 3 colors: 20 color balanced sets 4 colors: 880 5 colors: 5,280,908 ( code ) But this requires $2^{2^n}$ color balance checks, which is obviously intractable for larger n .

We've broached this subject before , though not with this particular question. Dan Uznanski came up with a list of primitive canonical groups for n=5 , where all non-primitive color balanced sets are combinations of these primitive groups. That seems like a promising direction, but it's not clear to me how you'd actually form and count the non-canonical sets from these primitive bases, or if you can actually find the primitives without brute forcing (as I think Dan did) . The motivation for this question was the same: Magic the Gathering expansions are almost always divided into ""factions"" that have colors associated with them (the color sets). One of the most popular expansions, for instance, is divided by all the 2-color pairs (Green-Blue, Green-Red, Green-White, Green-Black, Blue-Red etc). The factions have always been color balanced within the expansion, and I was curious exactly how many configurations there were.","You have n colors and you make nonempty sets from them.

As would: { {R}, {G}, {B} } { {B}, {G}, {RB}, {RG} } { {RGB}, {R}, {BG}} { } { {RGB}, {RG}, {RB}, {GB}, {R}, {G}, {B}} The sets { {R}, {G} } and { {RGB}, {R}, {G} } would not be color balanced for n=3 , as Blue (B) fails to appear in as many color sets as Red (R) and Green (G). How many color balanced sets can you create with n colors? The obvious brute force method is to a. enumerate all the color sets b. enumerate all sets of color sets and check each one for color balance. With this I found: 3 colors: 20 color balanced sets 4 colors: 880 5 colors: 5,280,908 ( code ) But this requires color balance checks, which is obviously intractable for larger n . Question : Is there a more tractable algorithm or combinatoric trick for finding the number of color balanced sets you can make with n colors? How many color balanced sets are there using 7 colors? We've broached this subject before , though not with this particular question. Dan Uznanski came up with a list of primitive canonical groups for n=5 , where all non-primitive color balanced sets are combinations of these primitive groups. That seems like a promising direction, but it's not clear to me how you'd actually form and count the non-canonical sets from these primitive bases, or if you can actually find the primitives without brute forcing (as I think Dan did) . The motivation for this question was the same: Magic the Gathering expansions are almost always divided into ""factions"" that have colors associated with them (the color sets). One of the most popular expansions, for instance, is divided by all the 2-color pairs (Green-Blue, Green-Red, Green-White, Green-Black, Blue-Red etc). The factions have always been color balanced within the expansion, and I was curious exactly how many configurations there were.",2^{2^n},"['combinatorics', 'algorithms']"

Let $S_i = f^{i}(\mathbb{N}) \setminus  f^{i+1}(\mathbb{N})$ , where $S_0 = \mathbb{N} \setminus f(\mathbb{N})$ . Proposition 1. $f^{j}(\mathbb{N}) \subseteq f^{i}(\mathbb{N})$ if $i \leq j$ . Proof. Since $f^{j}(\mathbb{N}) = f^{i}(f^{j-i}(\mathbb{N}))$ and $f^{j-i}(\mathbb{N}) \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ , it is pretty clear. Proposition 2. $S_i \cap S_j = \varnothing$ if $i \neq j$ . Proof. WLOG $i<j$ . Since $S_{i} = f^{i}(\mathbb{N}) \setminus  f^{i+1}(\mathbb{N})$ , so $S_i$ does not contain the elements of $f^{i+1}(\mathbb{N})$ . However, $S_j = f^{j}(\mathbb{N})\setminus  f^{j+1}(\mathbb{N})$ , so $S_j$ is a subset of $f^{j}(\mathbb{N})$ , and thus a subset of $f^{i+1}(\mathbb{N})$ , by proposition 1. So they are disjoint. Proposition 3. $|S_i| = |S_j|$ for all $i,j$ . Proof. It suffices to show that $|S_i| = |S_{i+1}|$ . I claim that $f$ is actually a bijection between them. (upon restriction of domain to $S_i$ ) We know that $f$ is an injection since $f^a$ is an injection. So surjectivity is a problem. Let $x \in f^{i+1}(\mathbb{N}) \setminus  f^{i+2}(\mathbb{N})$ , then there exists $y \in f^{i}(\mathbb{N})$ such that $f(y) = x$ , by definition. But if $y \in  f^{i+1}(\mathbb{N})$ , then $f(y) = x \in f^{i+2}(\mathbb{N})$ , contradiction. Therefore $y \in f^{i}(\mathbb{N}) \setminus  f^{i+1}(\mathbb{N}) = S_i$ , proving surjectivity. Let's say $|S_i| = n$ for all $i$ . Proposition 4. $\mathcal{F}$ is nonempty iff $a|b$ . Proof. If part is obvious(give $f(x) = x + b/a$ ). So let's go for only if part.

However since $S_i$ 's are all disjoint, so $\left| \bigcup_{i = 0}^{a-1} S_i \right| = an = b $ . Thus $\mathcal{F} = \varnothing $ if $a \nmid b$ , completing the proof.

The ordered Bell numbers have this approximation: $$a(n)\approx\dfrac{n!}{2(log2)^{n+1}}$$ which is nice and tidy, and allows one to compute the ordered Bell number $n$ to a ballpark of order of magnitude, which is useful for my purpose. I mostly wanted to reason about the difference in the order of magnitude for search spaces for a problem where the solution is either a single partition or single ordered partition of a set of size $n$ . This is, of course, the difference between the ordered Bell numbers and the Bell numbers. I realize now that it is probably easier and more accurate to simply enumerate the sequences, and their difference, over the domain in which I expect the $n$ might be for my problem ( $1\le n\le 50$ ). However, I am still curious about how the above approximation was derived, and if the same derivation would be impossible for the Bell numbers. I've read what I could find and partially understand about the subject, but it seems most lower bounds or approximations introduce either a number of terms that grows with $n$ , or functions or ideas whose approximation themselves aren't immediately clear to me, or may involve an expansion of terms as well. e.g. this approximation with the Lambert W function: $$B_n\sim \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\bigg(\dfrac{n}{W(n)}\bigg)^{n+\frac{1}{2}}\text{exp}\bigg(\dfrac{n}{W(n)}-n-1\bigg)$$ It seems to be no less trivial for computation than any other exact form, or Dobiński's formula for that matter. Below I've made a loose attempt at using Dobiński's reduced formula to derive an expression that meets my needs, but I haven't been able to quite get there, and I might have made some errors along the way. $$B_n = \Bigg\lceil\dfrac{1}{e}\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}\dfrac{k^n}{k!}\Bigg\rceil, \quad \dfrac{K^n}{K!} \le 1$$ $$0\lt B_n-\dfrac{1}{e}\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}\dfrac{k^n}{k!}\lt1$$ $$\dfrac{1}{e}\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}\dfrac{k^n}{k!} \lt B_n$$ At this point it seems we could choose some expression for $K$ such that the inequality holds, and only take the largest term of the sum as an approximation to have some bound. But I'm not sure where to go from here, or if the bound would be useful for my purposes. $K=2n$ satisfies $\dfrac{K^n}{K!} \le 1$ , but in that case the summation doesn't make sense for $k=0$ , so we'll assume the inequality doesn't hold for $n=0$ and push forward. Subbing $2n$ for $K$ we get the inequality: $$\dfrac{1}{e}\sum_{k=0}^{2n-1}\dfrac{k^n}{k!} \lt B_n, \quad \text{for } n \ge 1$$ But now on further examination, the value of $k$ for which $\dfrac{k^n}{k!}$ is the largest for a given $n$ is not obvious to me. Observing the graph of $y=\dfrac{x^n}{x!}$ and varying $n$ leads me to believe that finding the root of $k$ for a given $n$ , for the following partial derivative will allow us to find the largest term(s). $$\dfrac{\partial}{\partial k}\dfrac{ k^n}{k!}=0, \quad k,n \gt 0$$ But I think this is as far as I can get with my current knowledge. Once an expression for that root is found in terms of $n$ , you could round it to get (what I would imagine) is the largest term in the summation, or get two terms by applying the floor and the ceiling function to the expression, getting you the largest two terms, and a hopefully simple expression for the lower bound.

47,Is there an explicit construction of this bijection?,Is there an explicit construction of this bijection?,,"As part of my answer to another question , I needed the following fact: if $S = \{1, \ldots, n\}$ and $k \leq n/2$ , then there is a bijection $f : {S \choose k} \to {S \choose k}$ such that $t \cap f(t) = \emptyset$ for all $t \in {S \choose k}$ . Here $n$ and $k$ are positive integers, and ${S \choose k}$ denotes the family of all size- $k$ subsets of $S$ . Here's the proof I found for that fact. Let $p = \left\lvert{S \choose k}\right\rvert = {n \choose k}$ , and write ${S \choose k} = \{t_1, \ldots, t_p\}$ . Construct a bipartite graph $G$ on partite sets $A = \{a_1, \ldots, a_p\}$ and $B = \{b_1, \ldots, b_p\}$ by drawing an edge $a_ib_j$ whenever $t_i \cap t_j = \emptyset$ . Observe that $G$ is an ${n-k \choose k}$ -regular bipartite graph, where ${n-k \choose k} > 0$ , and therefore has a perfect matching $M$ , by Hall's Theorem. Now for each $i \in \{1, \ldots, p\}$ we have $a_ib_j \in M$ for exactly one value of $j$ , and we get the desired bijection just by taking $f(t_i) = t_j$ for the corresponding value of $j$ . Unfortunately, the proof above doesn't give an explicit construction of the bijection $f$ , which makes it hard to naturally use this bijection in a combinatorial proof. When $n = 2k$ , the function $f(t) = S-t$ is an easy example of a bijection with this property. Is there a nice explicit construction of such a bijection for general $k$ ? Some partial thoughts: it's tempting to try to build on the $n=2k$ case by modifying the function $f(t) = S-t$ , say by taking the function $f$ to be ""take the $k$ least elements of $S-t$ "", but it seems that the natural approaches to modifying that function end up failing to be injective (hence also fail to be surjective). For example, the "" $k$ least elements of $S-t$ "" function fails at $n=5$ and $k=2$ because it yields $f(\{3,4\}) = f(\{3,5\}) = \{1,2\}$ . When $k=1$ this is just asking for a derangement of $\{1, \ldots, n\}$ , and a function like $f(\{i\}) = \{i+1 \mod n\}$ works, where $x \mod n$ is the residue of $x$ modulo $n$ . When $k=2$ and $n \geq 4$ , I believe the following function works, where $\{x,y\} + i \mod n$ is shorthand for $\{x+i \mod n, y+i \mod n\}$ : $f(\{i, j\}) = \begin{cases} \{i, j\} + 2 \mod n, & \text{if $i-j \equiv \pm 1 \pmod{n}$} \\ \{i, j\} + 1 \mod n, & \text{otherwise.}\end{cases}$ This suggests that in a general construction, maybe we can just assign an integer $r_t$ for each $t \in {S \choose k}$ and use a map of the form $t \mapsto t+r_t \bmod{n}$ , with the values of $r_t$ chosen cleverly to ensure bijectivity and disjointness. However, this approach is doomed to fail when $t$ is a difference set for $\mathbb{Z}_n$ . To use an example of such a set due to Jungnickel, Pott, and Smith, when $n = 11$ and $t = \{1,3,4,5,9\}$ , it is easy to check that $t + r_t \mod 11$ intersects $t$ regardless of the choice of $r_t$ . So this approach cannot work in general either. Relevant external literature I've found so far: The $n = 2k+1$ case appears to have been solved by Kierstead and Trotter (1988) , in a superficially-different but equivalent formulation. Kai Jin (2019) refers to the problem of finding an explicit $1$ -factorization of the related ""bipartite Kneser graphs"" (equivalent to the graph $G$ described in the proof above) as a ""challenging open problem"", but we are only looking for an explicit description of one matching in a bipartite Kneser graph, not an entire $1$ -factorization.","As part of my answer to another question , I needed the following fact: if and , then there is a bijection such that for all .

I'm looking for a set $B$ of $|B|=b$ blocks, where $b\sim100$ , which are subsets of a set $X$ of $|X|=v$ points, $v=32$ or less preferably, $v=64$ . The blocks don't need to have a uniform size, but they should all be nonempty. More generally, given a union of a ""small"" set of blocks, it should be possible to infer the number of blocks in the union. To be precise, there should be an integer $\ell\geq 2$ , ideally as large as possible, such that $B$ has the following property: If $P$ and $Q$ are subsets of $B$ with $|P|<|Q|\leq \ell$ , then $\left|\bigcup P\right|<\left|\bigcup Q\right|$ . Note that if $b\leq v$ then this would be trivial. Just let $B$ be a set of $b$ distinct singleton subsets of $X$ . Then for all $P\subset B$ we get $\left|\bigcup P\right|=|P|$ , so the highlighted property is guaranteed for all $\ell$ . So the whole point of this question is asking if we can achieve some compression, i.e. $b>v$ . Note that in the $b>v$ regime we can't possibly achieve $\ell=b$ anymore, but I'd still like for $\ell$ to be large. For example, perhaps there is a design with $b=128$ , $v=32$ , and $\ell=3$ , such that every block has size $4$ , every union of two blocks has size $6$ , $7$ , or $8$ , and every union of three blocks has size $9$ or more.

61,Winning strategy of a unique game,Winning strategy of a unique game,,"First let's state the game: Game: Matin and Amo met each other in a gym and decided to play a game. The gym has long enough horizontal metal shaft and exactly one weight of each radii $1, 2,\dots, 100$ units. They take turns alternatively, starting with Amo, picking up a weight and inserting it from either left of right head of the shaft. After all weights have been inserted, Matin stands by the left side of the shaft and Amo stands by its right; among them the one who can see more weights wins; if they see equal number of weight then it is a draw. By seeing a weight we mean that no weight with bigger radius exist between the observer and that weight. Considering that they both are intelligent mathematicians, determine the result of this game. Here are my results: Matin has a draw strategy: If Amo starts with inserting the weight with radius 100, Matin inserts 99 from his end, after this move Matin just needs to insert the largest weight from his end; in this manner any weight inserted by him will be visible by him and not Amo. So Matin will see 51 weights and Amo will see 50 weights. But if Amo start with a weight with radius less than 100 Matin puts the weight with radius 100 at Amo's end and continues like the other case. Playing 99 when 100 is not played yet will cause the rival to have a draw strategy: This is actually quiet easy the rival will insert 100 from not his but the other end of shaft. The rest is similar to the above when 100 is inserted. Playing 98 before 99 and 100 will cause the rival to have a draw strategy: Again the other player does the same as above it is not hard to see it works.","First let's state the game: Game: Matin and Amo met each other in a gym and decided to play a game.

67,"Dimension of the Invariant Subspace $((\mathbb{C}^2)^{\otimes 2n})^{\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})}$",Dimension of the Invariant Subspace,"((\mathbb{C}^2)^{\otimes 2n})^{\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})}","This was posed as a challenging exercise by my professor. The exercise is to compute the dimension of the invariant subspace of $(\mathbb{C}^2)^{\otimes 2n}$ viewed as an $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})$ representation. For some background, $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})$ can be viewed as traceless $2 \times 2$ matrices with complex entries. So one common basis we see is $e = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}, f = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}, h = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}$ . The standard representation of $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})$ on $\mathbb{C}^2$ is just by matrix multiplication. Let $v_1 = (1,0)$ and $v_0=(0,1)$ . Observe that $ev_1 = fv_0 = 0$ , $ev_0 = v_1,fv_1 = v_0$ , and $hv_1 = v_1,hv_0 = -v_0$ . In general, if we have a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ acting on two representations $V,W$ , then we can define a representation on their tensor product by a Leibniz rule: $a(v \otimes w) = (av) \otimes w + v \otimes (aw)$ . An invariant subspace of a representation $V$ is really all vectors that are annihilated by every element of $\mathfrak{g}$ : $V^\mathfrak{g} := \{v \in V: av = 0, \forall a \in \mathfrak{g}\}$ . Okay, with that set up, some knowledge of $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})$ tells us that the Lie algebra is completely reducible and all the irreducible complex representations are of the form $V(n) = \langle v_n, v_{n-2}, v_{n-4},...,v_{2-n},v_{-n} \rangle$ , a $n+1$ dimensional vector space. The subscripts here represent the weight which really means that they are eigenvectors of $h$ with their eigenvalue being the subscript. So $h v_{n-6} = (n-6) v_{n-6}$ . I didn't write it this way above but it's mostly due to bookkeeping. Moreover, $e$ adds $2$ to the weight of vectors while $f$ subtracts $2$ from their weight. $h$ doesn't shift the weight. Anyways, the relevance of this is that the invariant subspace must lie within the weight $0$ subspace because otherwise, $h$ cannot annihilate. Also, under tensor products, weights add. For example, $\mathbb{C}^2 \otimes \mathbb{C}^2$ has basis: $v_1 \otimes v_1, v_1 \otimes v_0, v_0 \otimes v_1, v_0 \otimes v_0$ . The first one has weight $2$ , the middle two have weight $0$ , the last one has weight $-2$ . We can show that $e(v_1 \otimes v_0 - v_0 \otimes v_1) = 0$ and $f$ and $h$ also annihilate this vector. Well, $h$ acts by multiplication by $0$ on the weight $0$ subspace so we don't really need to check $h$ . Note also that if we take $(\mathbb{C}^2)^{\otimes n}$ where $n$ is odd, then there are no weight $0$ vectors other than the zero vector. In this case, there cannot be any nontrivial invariant subspace. That's why we take even number of copies. Now the bookkeeping: I chose $v_1,v_0$ to denote the basis vectors of $\mathbb{C}^2$ because then we can denote the basis elements of $W_{2n} := (\mathbb{C}^2)^{\otimes 2n}$ by strings of zeros and ones. So $\dim W_{2n} = 2^{2n}$ . Among these, the weight $0$ strings are precisely those with half being zeros, the other half being ones. So the weight zero subspace has dimension ${2n \choose n}$ . The invariant subspace has to have dimension smaller than this. I could have chosen $+,-$ instead but it might get confusing to read things like $(+-)-(-+)$ . Also, as an example, in $W_6$ , $e(101001) = (111001) + (101101) + (101011)$ . Basically, $e$ flips $0$ to $1$ like in computers and but kills $1$ ; that's why we see only three terms instead of six which we expect from Leibniz's rule. $f$ does the opposite. I suspect that we really only need to study $e$ but I'm not sure. Anyways, with that lengthy prologue (if you read till here, thank you), I admit that I don't see any combinatorial patterns. I thought I had found something when $n=2$ but it fell apart in $n=3$ . For $n=2$ , I think the invariant subspace has dimension $2$ and is spanned by $(1100)-(1010)-(0101)+(0011)$ and $(1001)-(1010)-(0101)+(0110)$ .","This was posed as a challenging exercise by my professor.

We say that a vertex $v\in V$ is $\chi$ - good if the number of neighbors of $v$ which get the same color as $v$ is no more than the number of neighbors of $v$ which get different color than $v$ . In other words, $$ |\set{u\in N(v):\ \chi(u) = \chi(v)}| \leq |\set{u\in N(v):\ \chi(u)\neq \chi(v)}| $$ where $N(v)$ is the set of all the neighbors of $v$ . A $2$ -coloring $\chi$ is said to be admissible if each vertex $v\in V$ is $\chi$ -good. Consider the following problem. Problem. Show that every graph admits an admissible $2$ -coloring. A proof of this problem can be given as follows. Given a $2$ -coloring $\chi$ of $G$ , we call an edge nice if the endpoints of this edge have different colors. Choose a $2$ -coloring $\chi_0$ of $V$ which has the maximum number of nice edges. We claim that any such coloring is admissible. To see this, assume on the contrary that $\chi_0:V\to \set{R, B}$ is not admissible. So there is a vertiex $v$ whihc is not $\chi_0$ -good.

The following argument shows that there exists a $2$ -coloring which has at least $|V|/2$ good vertices. Color each vertex independently red or blue with probability $1/2$ .

It is found that for any triangle, the   number at its incenter is the arithmetic mean of numbers at the vertices. Prove that every   point has been assigned the same number. Solution: Let us take any two random points $A$ and $D$ on the real plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ . Now let us select two points $B$ and $C$ such that $AD||BC, AD<BC$ and $AB=DC$ . Also let the real numbers assigned to $A,B,C,D$ be $a,b,c,d$ respectively. Observe that $ABCD$ is an isosceles trapezium with $AB=DC$ . Now let us produce $BA$ and $CD$ to meet at $E$ . Observe that in $\Delta EAD$ , we have $\angle EAD=\angle EDA\implies EA=ED$ . Thus we also have $EB=EC$ . Hence, $\Delta EAD$ and $\Delta EBC$ are both isosceles triangles with $EA=ED$ and $EB=EC$ respectively. Let the perpendicular dropped from $E$ to $BC$ meet $BC$ at $F$ . Now consider $\Delta EBD$ . $EF$ is the angle bisector of $\angle BED$ and let that the angle bisector of $\angle EBD$ meet $EF$ at $I$ . Thus $I$ is the incentre of $\Delta EBD$ . Now consider $\Delta ECA$ . $EF$ is the angle bisector of $\angle AEC$ . Join $C$ and $I$ . Observe that $\Delta EBI$ and $\Delta ECI$ are congruent triangles, which implies that $\angle EBI=\angle ECI=x$ (let). This implies that $\angle EBI=\angle IBD=x$ , which in turn implies that $\angle EBD= 2x$ . Again, $\Delta ADB \cong \Delta DAC\implies \angle DBA=\angle ACD\implies 2x=x+\angle ICA\implies \angle ICA=x.$ Hence, $\angle ICD=\angle ICA=x$ , which implies that $CI$ is the angle bisector of $\angle ECA$ . Hence, we can conclude that $I$ is also the incenter of $\Delta ECA$ . Hence the number assigned to $$I=\frac{b+d+e}{3}=\frac{a+c+e}{3}.$$ Thus we have $b+d=c+a$ . Thus, we can conclude that for any random isosceles trapezium $ABCD$ with $AD||BC$ and $AD<BC$ having real numbers $a,b,c,d$ assigned to vertices $A,B,C,D$ respectively, we will have $$a+c=b+d.$$ Let this property be called $\phi$ . Now select any two random points $A'$ and $B'$ on the real plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ and construct a regular pentagon $A'B'C'D'E'$ . Let the real number assigned to $A',B',C',D',E'$ be $a',b',c',d',e'$ respectively. Now $B'C'E'D'$ is an isosceles trapezium, hence by $\phi$ , we have $b'+d'=e'+c'$ . Similarly, $e'+c'=a'+d'$ , $a'+c'=b'+d'$ and $b'+e'=a'+d'$ . From these four equations we can conclude that $a'=b'=c'=d'=e'$ . Thus we have $a'=b'$ . From here, we can conclude that, since $A$ and $B$ were randomly chosen, therefore, we can reach to the same conclusion, i.e, $a'=b'$ , with any other pair of points $\in\mathbb{R}^2$ .

Eleven of them weigh the same; one of them is either heavier or lighter than the other eleven. You want to figure out which one is the counterfeit, and whether it is heavier or lighter. The only way you can measure the difference between coins is by using a balance, putting some number of coins on one side, and some on the other. What is the minimal number of weighings you need, and what strategy achieves this minimal number? For this puzzle, it turns out that only three weighings suffice! I won't reproduce the strategy here. Proving that three weighings is also optimal is then easy: there are 24 possible configurations (each of the 12 coins could be the odd one out, and it could be lighter or heavier), and a single weighing only has three possible outcomes: left is heavier, right is heavier, or the scale is balanced. This means that with two weighings you can only distinguish $3^2 = 9$ configurations. There are many, many variations of coin weighing puzzles all over the internet. Very often, optimality of a strategy is proved by an argument like I gave above: showing that $$ \lceil \log_3(\text{number of configurations}) \rceil = \text{number of moves}. $$ I am wondering if it is possible to create coin puzzles that are deceptively hard by that measure: where there are relatively few configurations, and yet solving the puzzle requires relatively many moves.

I know that there are combinatorial proofs that show $C_n={2n\choose n}-{2n\choose{n-1}}$ , but I want a specific proof that shows $(n+1)C_n={2n\choose n}$ .  Below is my attempt. Write $[k]=\{1,2,\ldots,k\}$ .  Furthermore, $\binom{X}{k}$ is the set of all subsets of cardinality $k$ of a given set $X$ . Let there be $2n$ people, named, $1$ , $2$ , $\ldots$ , $2n$ .  The $2n$ people are seated around a round table in the counterclockwise order.  Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the set of all pairings $$\big\{\{x_1,y_1\},\{x_2,y_2\},\ldots,\{x_n,y_n\}\big\}$$ of $[2n]$ in such a way that, when $x_i$ shakes hand with $y_i$ simultaneously for every $i\in[n]$ , there are no crossing arms.  Wlog, we assume that $x_i<y_i$ for each $i\in[n]$ and that $x_1<x_2<\ldots<x_n$ . Define $f:[n+1]\times\mathcal{P}\to\binom{[2n]}{n}$ as follows: $$f\Big(k,\big\{\{x_1,y_1\},\{x_2,y_2\},\ldots,\{x_n,y_n\}\big\}\Big)=\{y_1,y_2,\ldots,y_{k-1},x_k,x_{k+1},\ldots,x_n\}$$ for each $k\in[n+1]$ and $\big\{\{x_1,y_1\},\{x_2,y_2\},\ldots,\{x_n,y_n\}\big\}\in\mathcal{P}$ .

95,Is there a characterization of the permutations arising from this 'buggy' shuffle?,Is there a characterization of the permutations arising from this 'buggy' shuffle?,,"The classical 'correct' way of shuffling a deck of $n$ items is to use the Fisher-Yates shuffle : for (i = n; i > 1; i--) {   choose j randomly in [1..i];   swap deck[i] and deck[j]; } It's not hard to show that this algorithm works: there are $n!$ different paths through the code (there are $n$ possible choices for $j$ in the first iteration of the loop, then $n-1$ choices in the second iteration, giving $n\cdot(n-1)\cdot(n-2)\cdot\ldots=n!$ possbilities in total), and each of these generates a different permutation. Now consider an identical algorithm, but with $j$ chosen randomly from the range $[1\ldots (i-1)]$; in other words, at each step, the value at position $i$ is explicitly swapped with some other value (it can't be left in place). It's straightforward to show that every permutation that can be generated this way is a derangement: when we reach entry $k$ in the array, either its value is still $k$, in which case it's swapped with a lower entry and then entry $k$ is locked at a value different from $k$, or its value is no longer $k$, in which case $k$ was swapped into some entry of higher index and it can never be swapped back 'home'.
