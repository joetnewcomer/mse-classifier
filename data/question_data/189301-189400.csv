1,Is the maximal set of injectivity of a measurable map a measurable set?,Is the maximal set of injectivity of a measurable map a measurable set?,,"Consider a measurable function $f \colon X \to Y$, where $X$ and $Y$ are measurable spaces. The following definition makes sense even with no measurable structure, but the main question does not. Consider the sets $A$ that satisfy the following condition. The sets those where the function $f$ is injective with respect to the entire domain $X$: $$ \forall x_a \in A \; \forall x \in X \text{ we have } f(x_a) = f(x) \implies x= x_a. $$ In particular, this is a stronger condition than only requiring $f|_A$ to be injective, as $f$ may not take the values it takes in $A$ outside of $A$, either. Call such a set a good set. Based on blackboard sketches it seems that an equivalent definition for a set to be good is that, for all subsets $S \subseteq A$, we have $f^{-1}(f(S)) = S$. Unions of good sets are still good sets, so there is a maximal good set. Question: Is the maximal good set measurable? What about if $X = Y = \mathbb{R}$ (with Borel or Lebesgue measure, for example)? Blackboard sketching suggests that there is some hope for continuous real-valued functions.

Then $B$ is finite and $\vert{B}\vert \leq \vert{A}\vert$ , the equality holds $\iff f$ is bijective. Proof: $A$ is finite $\implies$ there exists a bijection $t:I_n \to A$ where $I_n$ is an initial segment of $\mathbb{N}$ . $\implies f\circ t:I_n \to B$ is a surjection. Let $g:B \to I_n$ s.t $g(b)=\min(f\circ t)^{-1} \{b\}$ . If $g(b)=g(c)$ , then $\min(f\circ t)^{-1} \{b\}=\min(f\circ t)^{-1} \{c\}$ . This implies there exists $m$ s.t $f\circ t (m)=b$ and $f\circ t (m)=c$ . Thus $b=c$ . So $g$ is injective. $\implies g:B \to g[B]$ is bijective. $g[B] \subseteq I_n \implies$ g[B] is finite. As a result, $B$ is finite. $g[B] \subseteq I_n \implies \vert{B}\vert \leq \vert{I_n}\vert=\vert{A}\vert \implies \vert{B}\vert \leq \vert{A}\vert$ .

It is easy to show that $(g:B \to I_n$ is bijective) $\Leftarrow  (f$ is bijective). So our task is to prove $(g:B \to I_n$ is bijective) $\implies  (f$ is bijective). Assume that $f(a_1)=f(a_2)=b$ . Then $\exists x_1,x_2 \in I_n$ s.t $f \circ t(x_1)=f \circ t(x_2)=b \implies x_1,x_2 \in \{m \in \mathbb{N} \mid f\circ t (m)=b\}$ . Assume $x_1 \neq x_2$ . Without loss for generality, we assume $x_1 < x_2$ . This implies $x_2 \neq \min(f\circ t)^{-1} \{b\} \implies \not \exists b \in B$ s.t $g(b)=x_2 \implies g$ is not surjective (CONTRADICTION). Thus $x_1=x_2$ or equivelently $a_1=a_2$ . To sum up, $f(a_1)=f(a_2)=b \implies a_1=a_2$ . As a result, $f$ is injective $\implies f$ is bijective.","Please check my below proof.

Define $g(x)$ as follows: $$g(x)=\frac{1}{1-x}f(x)$$ Does $g(x)$ have a maximum at $x=0.5$? Hint: Given that $f(x)\rightarrow0$ as $x\rightarrow0, \infty^+$, $g(x)$ will have a maximum when $0<x<1$. Moreover, $$\frac{dg(x)}{dx}=f'(x)\frac{1}{1-x}+f(x)\frac{1}{(1-x)^2}$$ Hence,  $$g'(x)=0 \iff f'(x)\frac{1}{1-x}=-f(x)\frac{1}{(1-x)^2} \iff \frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}=-\frac{1}{(1-x)}$$ We also know that $f'(x)=0 \iff x=1/2$. I think this question cannot be answered since $f(0.4)$ may be $0.5-\epsilon$ and $g(0.4)$ may therefore be bigger than $g(0.5)$, it depends on $f'(x)$, which we do not know.

79,Function being equal on infinitely many points implies it's constant?,Function being equal on infinitely many points implies it's constant?,,"I have the following problem and solution given in my textbook: Does there exist a nonconstant function $f : (1,∞) → \mathbb{R}$ satisfying the relation $f(x)= f(\frac{x^2+1}{2} )$ for all $x>1$ and such that $lim_{x\rightarrow \infty}f(x)$exists? For $x>1$ deﬁne the sequence $(x_n)n≥0$ by $x_0 = x$ and $x_{n+1} = x^2_{n}+1/2$ , $n ≥ 0$. The sequence is increasing because of theAM–GM inequality. Hence it has a limit L, ﬁnite or inﬁnite. Passing to the limit in the recurrence relation, we obtain $L^2 -2L +1 = 0$ ; hence either $L =1$ or $L =∞$. Since the sequence is increasing, $L ≥ x0 > 1$, so $L =∞$. We therefore have $f(x)= f(x_0) = f(x_1) = f(x_2) =···= lim_{n→∞} f(x_n) = lim_{x→∞} f(x)$. This implies that $f$ is constant, which is ruled out by the hypothesis.

I don't have access to a worked solution. Find $a,b$ for real $x$: $$f(x) = \frac{x^2-x+a}{x^2-4x+b}\quad when\quad f(x)\le-\frac{7}{2}\space or\space f(x) \ge \frac{1}{2}$$ I however keep getting stuck and find myself always facing division by $0$. I have a feeling I'm missing some intuition here. I don't think there are operation or arithmetic errors. I am not confident that I have setup the equations correctly either. My questions are: 1) What is the correct approach here / key idea I'm missing? 2) What is the solution? A sample of my working is as follows: $$\frac{x^2-x+a}{x^2-4x+b} = -\frac{7}{2}\Rightarrow 9x^2-30x = b - 2a\qquad [1]$$ $$\frac{x^2-x+a}{x^2-4x+b} = \frac{1}{2}\Rightarrow x^2+2x = b-2a \qquad [2]$$ $$[2]-[1]:\qquad 8x^2 - 32x = 0 \Rightarrow x(x-4) = 0\Rightarrow x=0,x=4$$ $x = 0$ leads to $b=0$ which leads to division by $0$ so I discarded it. Subbing $x=4$ gives: $$\frac{12 + a}{b} = -\frac{7}{2} \Rightarrow 24 + 2a = -7b \qquad [3]$$ $$\frac{12+1}{b} = \frac{1}{2} \Rightarrow 24 + 2a = b \qquad [4]$$ $[3] + 7[4]$ gives: $$192 + 16a = 0 \Rightarrow a = -\frac{192}{16} \Rightarrow a = -12$$ Subbing $a=-12$ into $[4] \Rightarrow b = 0$ So for $x=4,a=-12,b=0$ the denominator becomes $0$.","I'm self-studying and have attempted the following question.
