7,Bounding angles in Riemannian triangles with bounded sides,Bounding angles in Riemannian triangles with bounded sides,,"Is it true that angles in Riemannian triangles with bounded sides are uniformly bounded? More precisely, let $M$ be a Riemannian manifold. Given $0<r <s$, is there a number $\delta$ (depending on $M,r,s$), such that for every triangle in $M$  (composed of geodesic edges), with edge lengths in $[r,s]$, its angles are greater than $\delta$? Do we need compactness of $M$ for that to hold? Or are curvature bounds suffice? Edit: The statement is false if we allow arbitrary pairs of $(r,s),0<r<s$. In fact, if we allow $2r \le s$, then one can always take a degenerate triangle whose edge lengths are $r,r,2r$ and then two angles will be zero! Thus, there are to ways to proceed towards a correct version: Proposition (1): Let $M$ be compact, $0<r<s, 2r > s$. Then, there exist a number $\delta=\delta(M,r,s)$, such that for every triangle in $M$ with edge lengths in $[r,s]$, all its angles are greater than $\delta$. Proposition (2): Let $M$ be compact, $0<r<s$. Then, there exist a number $\delta=\delta(M,r,s)$, such that for every triangle in $M$ with edge lengths in $[r,s]$, at least one angle is greater than $\delta$. Below I give proofs for the two propositions stated above. Open questions: Do the propositions hold if we only assume lower bound the curvature, without compactnes? Is there a way to get an effective bound $\delta$ as a function of $r,s$ (depending also in $M$ somehow)?  What if we assume some bounds on the curvature? (The above discussion on degenerate triangles implies that in Proposition (1), we should expect $\delta(r,s)$ to tend to zero, when $s \to 2r$). Proof of Proposition (1): Suppose by contradiction there is no bound $\delta$. Then, there exist triangles $\Delta_n=\{[a_n,b_n],[b_n,c_n],[c_n,a_n]\}$ (where $[a_n,b_n]$ is a minimizing geodsic of unit speed connecting $a_n,b_n$ etc) with edge lengths in $[r,s]$, and each $\Delta_n$ has an angle $\theta_n$ which tends to zero when $n \to \infty$. By passing to a subsequence (or relabeling the vertices) we can assume $\theta_n=\angle b_n a_n c_n$. Using the Arzela-Ascoli theorem (and perhaps again passing to a subsequence) we can assume that $[a_n,b_n] \to [a,b], [b_n,c_n] \to [b,c],[c_n,a_n] \to [c,a]$, when the convergence is uniform ($[a,b],[b,c],[c,a]$ are paths connecting the corresponding limit points). By our assumption, $$d(a_n,b_n)=L([a_n,b_n]),$$ hence by the continuity of the distance function, and lower semi-continuity of length (w.r.t uniform convergence), we get that $$ L([a,b]) \le \lim_{n \to \infty} L([a_n,b_n])=\lim_{n \to \infty} d(a_n,b_n)=d(a,b),$$ hence $[a,b]$ is a shortest path connecting $a,b$ and similar statements hold for $[b,c],[c,a]$. Observation (1): Continuity of the distance imlies $d(a,b),d(b,c),d(c,a)$ all lie in $[r,s]$. Now, since angles in Riemannian manifolds are lower semi-continuous* , $$ \angle b a c \le \liminf \angle b_n a_n c_n =0,$$ so $\angle b a c=0$ Hence, $b,c$ lie on the same geodesic emanating from $a$. W.L.O.G we assume $b$ lies on that geodesic between $a,c$. But then $$ s \ge d(a,c)=d(a,b)+d(b,c)\ge 2r,$$ which contradicts the assumption. (we have used observation (1) above). Proof of Proposition (2): The proof is very similar to the proof of proposition (1), so we only give a sketch: Assume the claim is false. Then there exist suitable triangles $\Delta_n$, whose all angles are not greater than $\frac{1}{n}$.

The lower semi-continuity of angles which seems to hold in any intrinsic space of bounded curvature (see details in HK Lee's answer ); Locally, every Riemannian manifold has bounded curvature, and since angles are ""local"" objects (we can restrict our attention to the a neighbourhood of the corresponding vertex) the conclusion follows.","Is it true that angles in Riemannian triangles with bounded sides are uniformly bounded?

11,"Calippo, toothpaste and milk .. packing","Calippo, toothpaste and milk .. packing",,"This post was posing the question ""The Calippo™ popsicle has a specific shape ... Does this shape have an official name?"", and the accepted answer was that it is a Right Conoid which in fact is much resembling. However,  a conoid is not developable and so cannot be economically made out of a cardboard sheet. Now, a cardboard cylinder, pinched and sealed at one end, will look like a toothpaste tube, and the pinched end will  be larger than the mouth diameter (by $\pi /2 $). That does not fit to the calippo's look,  whose tube is in fact fabricated from a cone (made from a plane circular sector) pinched at one end (and reinforced at the opposite circular rim). And a related subject is that,  a cylinder with both ends  pinched at  90° relative to each other make up  a tetrahedral ""milk carton"" (berlingot in French). In this Mathcurve page after stating that ""le berlingot est la surface réglée non développable .. "", referring to a picture of a real tetrahedral milk carton is noted: ""Attention, un berlingot comme ci-dessus fabriqué avec du papier  est une surface développable, fabriquée avec un patron de tétraèdre en arrondissant les arêtes... "" Also refer to the Coin Conic page. Suppose that the material is inextensible, and that a grid of directrices and orthogonal circles is marked on the cone/cylinder, then it is clear that upon pinching the directrices will not appear straight.

Does this shape have an official name?"", and the accepted answer was that it is a Right Conoid which in fact is much resembling. However,  a conoid is not developable and so cannot be economically made out of a cardboard sheet. Now, a cardboard cylinder, pinched and sealed at one end, will look like a toothpaste tube, and the pinched end will  be larger than the mouth diameter (by $\pi /2 $). That does not fit to the calippo's look,  whose tube is in fact fabricated from a cone (made from a plane circular sector) pinched at one end (and reinforced at the opposite circular rim). And a related subject is that,  a cylinder with both ends  pinched at  90° relative to each other make up  a tetrahedral ""milk carton"" (berlingot in French). In this Mathcurve page after stating that ""le berlingot est la surface réglée non développable .. "", referring to a picture of a real tetrahedral milk carton is noted: ""Attention, un berlingot comme ci-dessus fabriqué avec du papier  est une surface développable, fabriquée avec un patron de tétraèdre en arrondissant les arêtes... "" Also refer to the Coin Conic page. Suppose that the material is inextensible, and that a grid of directrices and orthogonal circles is marked on the cone/cylinder, then it is clear that upon pinching the directrices will not appear straight.  Since a developable surface implies that it be ruled, then either the ruling lines have moved, or the surface has undergone some deformation.

I am able to acquire six locations of modelled wind data from the Met Office. To make the most of this I want to choose six locations that would enable at least on of these locations to at least be representative of any possible position a bird is at within this semi-circle. So I imagine there is an optimal distribution of the 6 locations within this semi-circle that minimises the maximum distance a bird could be from any one location. I have a possible way of working out this distribution below and it would be very much appreciated if anyone could comment on the suitability of this method or come up with any other methods that would enable a solution to the problem. Thank you. Let $S$ be the unit semicircle in the plane. We want to find points $x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$, $x_4$, $x_5$, $x_6$ in $S$ so as to minimise $\max\{\min\{d(x,x_1), ... ,d(x,x_6)\} : x \in\ S\}$.",,['geometry']

The width of the window is 10 inches. My head is being kept still 5 inches from the centre of the window. Fix a point on the cloud, say one of the very edges, enters the window frame and then leaves the window frame 20 seconds later.

So here it goes: The Sine Rule is as follows: $$\frac{\sin(\alpha)}{a}=\frac{\sin(\beta)}{b}=\frac{\sin(\gamma)}{c}$$ $\mathbf{Proof}$: We are given an acute triangle $\triangle OPQ$ with sides $a$,$b$, and $c$. Opposite of the sides are the angles $\alpha$,$\beta$, and $\gamma$, respectively. We will divide $\triangle OPQ$ with $2$ line segments, $h_1$ and $h_2$. The line segment $h_1$ will have an endpoint at angle $\gamma$ and extend to side $c$ to make $h_1$ perpendicular to side $c$. The line segment $h_2$ will have an endpoint at angle $\alpha$ and will extend to side $a$ to make $h_2$ perpendicular to side $a$. We know that $\sin(\alpha)=\frac{h_1}{b}$ and $\sin(\beta)=\frac{h_1}{a}$. We can deduce that $h_1=a\sin(\beta)$ and $h_1=b\sin(\alpha)$. From these two equations, we can produce the following result: $$\begin{align}a\sin(\beta)=b\sin(\alpha)\\ \frac{\sin(\beta)}{b}=\frac{\sin(\alpha)}{a}\end{align}$$ We now turn our attention to see that $\sin(\gamma)=\frac{h_2}{b}$ and $\sin(\beta)=\frac{h_2}{c}$. As before we can deduce that $h_2=b\sin(\gamma)$ and $h_2=c\sin(\beta)$. From this system of equations we can simplify it in the following way: $$\begin{align}b\sin(\gamma)=c\sin(\beta)\\ \frac{\sin(\gamma)}{c}=\frac{\sin(\beta)}{b}\end{align}$$ It follows that if $\frac{\sin(\alpha)}{a}=\frac{\sin(\beta)}{b}$, and $\frac{\sin(\beta)}{b}=\frac{\sin(\gamma)}{c}$, then $\frac{\sin(\alpha)}{a}=\frac{\sin(\gamma)}{c}$. Thus proving that $$\frac{\sin(\alpha)}{a}=\frac{\sin(\beta)}{b}=\frac{\sin(\gamma)}{c}$$ Which concludes my proof. I know it's a pretty basic concept learned in high school trig but I just wanted to start off  on something easy. ANY input would be great.","So I made my first attempt at a proof.

69,Product of incircle and excircles,Product of incircle and excircles,,"How can I obtain a polynomial formula for the product (i.e. union) of a triangle's incircle and excircles , avoiding the use of radicals? Assume three lines in general position are given by three equations $$a_ix+b_iy+c_i=0\quad\text{for }i\in\{1,2,3\}$$ A circle with center $(p,q)$ and radius $r$ may be given by the equation $$(x-p)^2+(y-q)^2-r^2=0$$ which can also be written as $$(x,y,1)\begin{pmatrix}1&0&-p\\0&1&-q\\-p&-q&p^2+q^2-r^2\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}x\\y\\1\end{pmatrix}=0$$ Using the adjugate matrix to switch from primal to dual conic, we can say a line is tangent to that circle if it satisfies $$(a,b,c)\begin{pmatrix} p^2-r^2 & pq & p \\ pq & q^2-r^2 & q \\ p & q & 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}a\\b\\c\end{pmatrix}=0$$ So by plugging in the three lines from the start, we get three non-linear equations. In general we get 4 distinct solutions for $p,q,r^2$ . (We actually get 8 solutions if we solve for $r$ instead of $r^2$ , but these are only $r=\pm\sqrt{r^2}$ and by convention we'd pick the positive radius. All the formulas only use $r^2$ not $r$ so it makes sense to treat that as the variable.) These 4 solutions correspond to the incircle and the three excircles of the triangle formed by the lines. The underlying quartic equation behind this would introduce plenty of radicals, and rules on how to match the solutions, which complicates subsequent work. It would be much better if we could avoid taking roots here. And I think that by dealing with all four circles together, that should be possible. Specifically I'm looking for the product of the four circle equations, which corresponds to an algebraic curve of degree 8 that represents the union of the four circles. I conjecture that the product of the four circles, i.e. the formula $$0=\prod_{i=1}^4 (x-p_i)^2+(y-q_i)^2-r_i^2$$ can be stated as a polynomial of combined degree 8 in $x,y$ where the coefficients themselves can be given as polynomials in the coordinates of the lines, namely $a_i,b_i,c_i$ . If the coordinates of the lines are rational, then the coefficients in the product of circles will be rational, too. I have checked the last part of this conjecture, the rationality of coefficients, using one specific triangle, chosen fairly arbitrarily (using three rational points on the unit circle): \begin{align*} a_1 &= 23 & b_1 &= 41 & c_1 &= -47 \\ a_2 &= 4 & b_2 &= -7 & c_2 &= 4 \\ a_3 &= 3 & b_3 &= -5 & c_3 &= 3 \end{align*} For this I got four circles characterized by \begin{align*} 244205p^4 - 366418p^2 + 243984p - 45648 &= 0 \\ 244205q^4 - 1098812q^2 + 1268540q - 411845 &= 0 \\ 59636082025r^8 - 598843408280r^6 + 529183150574r^4 - 356490680r^2 + 60025 &= 0 \end{align*} Matching the correct roots of these polynomials to get consistent solutions: \begin{align*} p_1 &\approx \phantom+0.47089 & q_1 &\approx \phantom+0.86139 & r_1^2 &\approx 0.00032872 \\ p_2 &\approx \phantom+0.50761 & q_2 &\approx \phantom+0.88289 & r_2^2 &\approx 0.00034533 \\ p_3 &\approx -1.49989 & q_3 &\approx \phantom+0.85359 & r_3^2 &\approx 0.97839603 \\ p_4 &\approx \phantom+0.52138 & q_4 &\approx -2.59788 & r_4^2 &\approx 9.06255888 \end{align*} The product of these four circles, scaled to avoid divisions, is then the following: \begin{align*} 59636082025&\,x^8 \\ + 238544328100&\,x^6y^2 \\ + 357816492150&\,x^4y^4 \\ + 238544328100&\,x^2y^6 \\ + 59636082025&\,y^8 \\ - 241134854740&\,x^6 \\ + 424846368960&\,x^5y \\ - 1438821671300&\,x^4y^2 \\ + 849692737920&\,x^3y^3 \\ - 2154238778380&\,x^2y^4 \\ + 424846368960&\,xy^5 \\ - 956551961820&\,y^6 \\ + 108802118880&\,x^5 \\ + 265528980600&\,x^4y \\ - 1771920221760&\,x^3y^2 \\ + 3788213456560&\,x^2y^3 \\ - 1880722340640&\,xy^4 \\ + 3522684475960&\,y^5 \\ - 12729722876&\,x^4 \\ + 1691695948800&\,x^3y \\ - 2241047404232&\,x^2y^2 \\ + 2683644936960&\,xy^3 \\ - 6476277331836&\,y^4 \\ - 484880944704&\,x^3 \\ + 468260157040&\,x^2y \\ - 1625087765184&\,xy^2 \\ + 7083496190160&\,y^3 \\ + 48256725504&\,x^2 \\ + 293698179840&\,xy \\ - 4644695250832&\,y^2 \\ - 13129818624&\,x \\ + 1675829775360&\,y \\ - 243236814336&\quad=0 \end{align*} This polynomial will factor into four circles over $\mathbb R$ or $\mathbb A$ but is irreducible over $\mathbb Q$ . How can I get these coefficients without going through the detour of the four distinct circles and their irrational parameters? How can I do this in situations where the coordinates of the lines themselves might contain unknowns? Background for my question is Probability that the centroid of a triangle is inside its incircle . For an exact solution there, radicals would make one's life really hard. But at the same time, since the centroid will never lie within an excircle, considering the sign of the product of circles should work just as well, and when combined with a rational parametrization of the circle might lend itself to some nice algebraic approach for that question. That's what got me thinking, but at the moment I'm actually more intrigued by this question here for its own merit. I feel like I'm missing some very useful tool in my arsenal, but don't know how to learn more. I'm including the Galois theory tag as I have the rough understanding that Galois theory deals with the relationship between the different roots of a polynomial. So if I want to understand how the different solutions interact when I multiply the circles, I assume that topic might have contributions. But so far my knowledge of Galois theory is pretty much exhausted by getting my computer algebra system to compute the Galois group of some polynomial, and then using that to decide whether a number is constructible or not. Update: For a moment I thought that the tool I had missed might be Vieta's formulas . But some of my coefficients will be combinations of roots of different polynomials. So I can't predict all my coefficients by just looking at the defining polynomial for one of my circle parameters, and when I look at two then the problem of how to match the roots returns. It seems to me that just the two polynomials won't have enough information on how to do that. To expand on this idea: If we define $$d_i:=-2p_i\qquad e_i:=-2q_i\qquad f_i:=p_i^2+q_i^2-r_i^2$$ then the product of circles is $$0 = \prod_{i=1}^4 (x+y)^2 + d_ix + e_iy + f_i$$ By treating $(x^2+y^2)$ as a single variable we can achieve a form where each monomial has a more direct correspondence with the $3\times4$ coefficients from the individual circles: \begin{align*} 0 = \Bigl(59636082025 &\, (x^2+y^2)^4 \\ -\,357924430760 &\, (x^2+y^2)^2x^2 \\ +\,476656901760 &\, (x^2+y^2)x^3 \\ -\,178359517440 &\, x^4 \\ +\,424846368960 &\, (x^2+y^2)^2xy \\ -\,778885009760 &\, (x^2+y^2)x^2y \\ +\,353718243840 &\, x^3y \\ -\,1073341537840 &\, (x^2+y^2)^2y^2 \\ -\,1512867557760 &\, (x^2+y^2)xy^2 \\ +\,2460406401440 &\, x^2y^2 \\ +\,2478270485600 &\, (x^2+y^2)y^3 \\ +\,1345667232000 &\, xy^3 \\ -\,1609193731600 &\, y^4 \\ +\,116789576020 &\, (x^2+y^2)^3 \\ -\,367854782880 &\, (x^2+y^2)^2x \\ +\,354562216320 &\, (x^2+y^2)x^2 \\ -\,103527290880 &\, x^3 \\ +\,1044413990360 &\, (x^2+y^2)^2y \\ +\,1337977704960 &\, (x^2+y^2)xy \\ -\,2253031422720 &\, x^2y \\ -\,4678151178480 &\, (x^2+y^2)y^2 \\ -\,1243734111360 &\, xy^2 \\ +\,4362204610400 &\, y^3 \\ -\,188932421756 &\, (x^2+y^2)^2 \\ -\,381353653824 &\, (x^2+y^2)x \\ +\,537823817856 &\, x^2 \\ +\,2721291579760 &\, (x^2+y^2)y \\ +\,293698179840 &\, xy \\ -\,4155128158480 &\, y^2 \\ -\,489567092352 &\, (x^2+y^2) \\ -\,13129818624 &\, x \\ +\,1675829775360 &\, y \\ -\,243236814336 & \Bigr)/59636082025 \end{align*} We can get the parameters of the individual circles characterized by \begin{align*} 244205d^4 - 1465672d^2 - 1951872d - 730368 &= 0 \\ 244205e^4 - 4395248e^2 - 10148320e - 6589520 &= 0 \\ 59636082025f^4 - 116789576020f^3 - 188932421756f^2 + 489567092352f - 243236814336 &= 0 \end{align*} Now for example the coefficient of $x^4$ is $$d_1d_2d_3d_4=-\frac{730368}{244205}=-\frac{178359517440}{59636082025}$$ This is a straight-forward application of Vieta, dividing the constant last coefficient by the leading one. Similarly the coefficient for $(x^2+y^2)^3$ is $$f_1+f_2+f_3+f_4=\frac{2164}{1105}=\frac{116789576020}{59636082025}$$ again following straight from the polynomial for $f$ , dividing the second coefficient by the leading one and flipping the sign. But other coefficients require miyed combinations of letters $d,e,f$ . For example the one for $(x^2+y^2)^2xy$ is $$\sum_{i=1}^4\sum_{\substack{j=1\\j\neq i}}^4d_ie_j=\frac{7872}{1105}=\frac{424846368960}{59636082025}$$ I guess I might be able to somehow use $$\sum_{i=1}^4\sum_{\substack{j=1\\j\neq i}}^4d_ie_j= \left(\sum_{i=1}^4d_i\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^4e_i\right)-\left(\sum_{i=1}^4d_ie_i\right)$$ if I were to also compute the defining quartic polynomial for the product $d_ie_i$ , but if I get a polynomial for the product by combining the polynomials for $d$ and $e$ then I get a degree $4\times 4=16$ which has all the combinations. In my example I find $$59636082025(de)^4 + 424846368960(de)^3 - 318329227424(de)^2 - 3822912737280(de) + 4812774543360 = 0$$ is actually quartic, but I don't know how to find this polynomial without going through the irrational individual circles first. For some of the other coefficients from the big equation, the inclusion-exclusion formulas I need to get all the combinations of letters with different indices would be even more complicated.","How can I obtain a polynomial formula for the product (i.e. union) of a triangle's incircle and excircles , avoiding the use of radicals? Assume three lines in general position are given by three equations A circle with center and radius may be given by the equation which can also be written as Using the adjugate matrix to switch from primal to dual conic, we can say a line is tangent to that circle if it satisfies So by plugging in the three lines from the start, we get three non-linear equations. In general we get 4 distinct solutions for . (We actually get 8 solutions if we solve for instead of , but these are only and by convention we'd pick the positive radius. All the formulas only use not so it makes sense to treat that as the variable.) These 4 solutions correspond to the incircle and the three excircles of the triangle formed by the lines. The underlying quartic equation behind this would introduce plenty of radicals, and rules on how to match the solutions, which complicates subsequent work. It would be much better if we could avoid taking roots here. And I think that by dealing with all four circles together, that should be possible. Specifically I'm looking for the product of the four circle equations, which corresponds to an algebraic curve of degree 8 that represents the union of the four circles. I conjecture that the product of the four circles, i.e. the formula can be stated as a polynomial of combined degree 8 in where the coefficients themselves can be given as polynomials in the coordinates of the lines, namely . If the coordinates of the lines are rational, then the coefficients in the product of circles will be rational, too. I have checked the last part of this conjecture, the rationality of coefficients, using one specific triangle, chosen fairly arbitrarily (using three rational points on the unit circle): For this I got four circles characterized by Matching the correct roots of these polynomials to get consistent solutions: The product of these four circles, scaled to avoid divisions, is then the following: This polynomial will factor into four circles over or but is irreducible over . How can I get these coefficients without going through the detour of the four distinct circles and their irrational parameters? How can I do this in situations where the coordinates of the lines themselves might contain unknowns? Background for my question is Probability that the centroid of a triangle is inside its incircle . For an exact solution there, radicals would make one's life really hard. But at the same time, since the centroid will never lie within an excircle, considering the sign of the product of circles should work just as well, and when combined with a rational parametrization of the circle might lend itself to some nice algebraic approach for that question. That's what got me thinking, but at the moment I'm actually more intrigued by this question here for its own merit. I feel like I'm missing some very useful tool in my arsenal, but don't know how to learn more. I'm including the Galois theory tag as I have the rough understanding that Galois theory deals with the relationship between the different roots of a polynomial. So if I want to understand how the different solutions interact when I multiply the circles, I assume that topic might have contributions. But so far my knowledge of Galois theory is pretty much exhausted by getting my computer algebra system to compute the Galois group of some polynomial, and then using that to decide whether a number is constructible or not. Update: For a moment I thought that the tool I had missed might be Vieta's formulas . But some of my coefficients will be combinations of roots of different polynomials. So I can't predict all my coefficients by just looking at the defining polynomial for one of my circle parameters, and when I look at two then the problem of how to match the roots returns. It seems to me that just the two polynomials won't have enough information on how to do that. To expand on this idea: If we define then the product of circles is By treating as a single variable we can achieve a form where each monomial has a more direct correspondence with the coefficients from the individual circles: We can get the parameters of the individual circles characterized by Now for example the coefficient of is This is a straight-forward application of Vieta, dividing the constant last coefficient by the leading one.

So for fun, I defined a ""wannabe cube"" as a cuboid whose dimensions are (not equal, but) consecutive integers and looked to solve the analogous problem. So let's say the $k$ -th wanna be cube is the rectangular prism of size $k\times(k+1)\times(k+2).$ Turns out the fifth wannabe cube can be divided into the first four. Or oppositely, we can build up the fifth wannabe cube from the first four as follows: Join the first and second wannabe cubes along a $2\times 3$ face producing a $2\times 3\times 5$ prism. Join this to the third wannabe cube along a $3\times 5$ face producing a $3\times5\times 6$ prism. Join this to the fourth wanna be cube along a $5\times6$ face produing a $5\times 6\times 7$ prism, which is the fifth wannabe cube. This construction actually works in any dimension. Say if we define a wannabe $n$ -cube as an $n$ -dimensional orthotope of consecutive integral dimensions. Particularly, the $k$ -th wannabe $n$ -cube is the orthotope of size $k\times(k+1)\times...\times(k+n-1)$ . Then the $(n+2)$ -th wannabe $n$ -cube can always be divided into the first $n+1$ such wannabe $n$ -cubes. In, say, 2 dimensions this amounts to fitting together the three rectangles of sizes $1\times 2$ , $2\times 3$ , and $3\times 4$ into a $4\times 5$ rectangle.

I'm wondering if there are any divisions of wannabe $n$ -cubes for $n>2$ that aren't given by this family of constructions. For 3 dimensions, I was able to show that the outlined construction is the only one which can be obtained by incrementally joining wannabe cubes to a growing cuboid along matching sides.

80,Geometry of a diagonal in a flag,Geometry of a diagonal in a flag,,"Problem I came across the flag of Trinidad and Tobago and it got me thinking about the geometry of that diagonal. Picture below. If you look at the diagonal, you'll see it doesn't just go from one corner to the opposite. It's placed in such a way that the lower border of the stripe touches one corner, and the upper border touches the opposite corner. I found a few other flags with diagonals placed in that way, like the flags of Brunei , Republic of Congo , or the Democratic Republic of Congo . I was thinking, how would you draw that diagonal if you only knew the flag's width and height, and the stripe width. I haven't found an easy way to solve this, and I was wondering if someone has thought about this before, or wanted to give it a try. I've also read this post before posting this question, thanks to a recommendation from ""similar questions"". That one is actually the same setup, but the questions asked are different, so I'm still unsure how to solve this problem. What I've done so far I'll start with some definitions. The dimensions I've defined can be found on the figure below. The bottom-left corner detail with more dimensions below: Flag's width: $w$ . Flag's height: $h$ . Flag's diagonal: $d$ . Note this is also the stripe's diagonal. Stripe's width, or ""thickness"": $t$ . Stripe's length: $l$ . Note this is the distance $\overline{AD}$ , or $\overline{BC}$ . The angle between the stripe and the bottom border of the flag: $\alpha$ . Vertical distance $\overline{AB}$ : $y$ . Horizontal distance $\overline{AB}$ : $x$ . I ultimately want to know how to define $x$ and $y$ in terms of $w$ , $h$ , and $t$ . i.e. $x(w, h, t)$ and $y(w, h, t)$ . One thought that I have in mind, but haven't been able to write mathematically is the relation between the thickness and the angle.

Thanks!","Problem I came across the flag of Trinidad and Tobago and it got me thinking about the geometry of that diagonal. Picture below. If you look at the diagonal, you'll see it doesn't just go from one corner to the opposite. It's placed in such a way that the lower border of the stripe touches one corner, and the upper border touches the opposite corner. I found a few other flags with diagonals placed in that way, like the flags of Brunei , Republic of Congo , or the Democratic Republic of Congo . I was thinking, how would you draw that diagonal if you only knew the flag's width and height, and the stripe width. I haven't found an easy way to solve this, and I was wondering if someone has thought about this before, or wanted to give it a try. I've also read this post before posting this question, thanks to a recommendation from ""similar questions"". That one is actually the same setup, but the questions asked are different, so I'm still unsure how to solve this problem. What I've done so far I'll start with some definitions.

In thinking about it I came up with a question that seems appropriate to ask here, as it's purely a maths question. Suppose you're at a point on the surface of a sphere in 4 dimensions. There is a stationary point in the sky, infinitely far away - call it the sun. The sphere you're standing on rotates at a constant rate and you move with it, so from your point of view the stationary point moves across the sky. Now suppose we take your view of the sky and project it via a stereographic projection into a 3D Euclidean space. The question is, what does the path traced out by the sun look like in this three dimensional space? We can assume without loss of generality that the rotation of the sphere preserves the $xy$ plane and the $uv$ plane. The answer to this question will depend on the location of the stationary point and of the observer, and also on the ratio of the two rotation rates that are needed to specify such a rotation in 4D.

Let the smallest bounded region have area $1$ . Determine the minimum (or possibly infimum) of the total bounded area. For example, $3$ lines create one triangular region while $4$ create one quadrangular region and two triangular regions (the complete region thus bounded is called a complete quadrilateral). I know that $N$ lines in general position will create ${N+1\choose 2}+1$ regions, ${N+1\choose 2}+1-2N=\frac{(N-1)(N-2)}{2}$ of those bounded on all sides by line segments, but I wanted to figure out how to make the regions maximally “equal” and how close it’s possible to get to the ideal minimum of $\frac{(N-1)(N-2)}{2}$ for a given $N$ (where all bounded regions have area $1$ ). I have little to no experience in the field of maximizing or minimizing geometrical quantities (especially in such a large mathematical space in which to minimize/maximize as this problem gives), so solving this is entirely beyond my experience. It is easy to show that there is no maximal bounded area for $N\geq 4$ by drawing some three lines arbitrarily close to meeting at a point. In this case, the resulting triangular region becomes arbitrarily close to a point while maintaining an area of $1$ in the problem's scaling, and the area of the remaining regions grows arbitrarily large by comparison. But I really don't know how to do any of this when it comes to minimizing the total bounded area. For $N=3$ , with only one region, the minimum area is trivially $1$ . For $N=4$ , some fiddling around on Desmos has convinced me that the minimum area is indeed the ideal of $3$ . For $N=5$ , I believe that the minimum area still remains the ideal of $6$ (although here my fiddling around on Desmos gets much more nonrigorous and guesswork-y). For $N\geq 6$ , however, any proofs or even good guesses of any sort elude me entirely. If finding the exact minimum area (or infimum in case there’s somehow a minimum that can be approached but not actually reached, which I would not expect) is in fact too difficult to do well, I would also be interested in the growth rate of the actual minimal area relative to the ideal as $N\to\infty$ .

(No polyomino with holes tiles the plane, so the fourth logical category has no members.) I am curious about the asymptotic behavior of this distribution for large $n$ . For $n\le 6$ , every polyomino on $n$ cells tiles the plane. However, as $n$ grows larger, this ceases to be the case. Using the values given at this page , I have plotted the ratio of polyominoes in each category for $n\le 25$ : Emprically, the ratio of tiling polyominoes appears to decay exponentially, roughly halving at every increase in $n$ ; the ratio $1:x$ where $x=2^{n-11}$ matches the observed data quite well. I also suspect that the polyominoes with holes dominate for very large $n$ , in that their ratio approaches 1; one would expect a ""generic"" large polyomino to have many holes, though I'm not sure how to formalize this intuition and obtain a formal proof.
