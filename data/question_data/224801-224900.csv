18,How are (pre)sheaves even well-defined on sites?,How are (pre)sheaves even well-defined on sites?,,"I am trying to learn a bit about étale cohomology from Milne’s book and I have run into some early problems. I learned ordinary abelian sheaf cohomology from Hartshorne. There, sheaves are defined on the category of open subsets of a scheme $X$ in which the morphisms are just the open inclusions. A presheaf on $X$ is then just a contravariant functor on this category. To motivate the étale site and étale cohomology, many sources first introduce sites via the Zariski open immersions, but I am already confused by this. The Zariski site on $X$ is defined to have objects $f \colon U \rightarrow X$ which are open immersions and morphisms given by maps $V \rightarrow U$ which commute with the structure morphisms of $U$ and $V$ . Then a presheaf $\mathscr{I}$ is a contravariant functor on this category. With this definition, many sources, including Milne, call the group $\mathscr{I}(U)$ the sections over $U$ . But already I don’t know what this means. In the case of Hartshorne this is fine. But in the case of the Zariski site, there could be many distinct open immersions from $U$ to $X$ . So what then does $\mathscr{I}(U)$ actually refer to? Is there any reason to believe that $\mathscr{I}(f \colon U \rightarrow X)$ is equal or even isomorphic to $\mathscr{I}(g \colon U \rightarrow X)$ if $f$ and $g$ are distinct open immersions? I suspect in the sheaf case one can use the sheaf axioms to argue that they are isomorphic, but what about in the presheaf case? The problem seems to be even worse when it comes to the étale site. In the case of the Zariski site, at least open immersions factor into an isomorphism and an open inclusion. But two étale morphisms $f \colon U \rightarrow X$ and $g \colon U \rightarrow X$ need not be related in any way as far as I can see. So what does $\mathscr{I}(U)$ mean, and is there any reason to think it is independent of the structure morphism?

Let $P\in Y$ be a point. Then $Y$ is nonsingular at $P$ if and only if the local ring $\mathscr{O}_{P,Y}$ is a regular local ring. Now in the proof, Hartshorne puts $P=(a_1,\ldots,a_n)$, $a_P=(x_1-a_1,\ldots,x_n-a_n)$ the maximal ideal corresponding to $P$ in $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$, and $b$ the ideal of $Y$ in $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$.

By Corollary 5.35 of Rotman's Homological Algebra we got that : If $D$ is an integral domain and $Q=\text{Frac}(D)$ , then $Q$ is a flat $D$ -module . So we got it, $Q$ is a flat $D$ -module, now my idea is to use Bass Theorem to kill this one, this theorem states (among other things) that $M_{R}$ has projective cover ( $M_{R}$ is perfect) iff every $M_{R}$ flat module is projective. So I reduced (or complicated :S) the problem to prove that the flat module $Q_{D}$ is not projective, which is the part I cannot prove. I tried to study the proof of $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{Z}}$ is a flat module that is not projective but they use the fact $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathbb{Z}}$ is finitely generated and that $\mathbb{Z}$ is DIP but in my case I dont know if $Q_{D}$ is finitely generated, also $D$ is not be DIP. Any help in order to prove this problem in the direction I propose or any other will be apreciated. Thanks!","Let be an integral domain which is not a field and the field of fractions of .

99,Question of Hartshorne II8.15,Question of Hartshorne II8.15,,"The theorem $8.15$ (p.177) from the Hartshorne's book ""Algebraic Geometry"" says: "" Let $X$ be an irreducible separated scheme of finite type over an algebraically closed field $k$ . Then $\Omega_{X/k}$ is a locally free sheaf of rank $n= \dim \ X$ iff $X$ is nonsingular variety over $k$ ."" Proof: If $x\in X$ is a closed point, then the local ring $B =\mathcal{O}_{x,X}$ has dimension $n$ , residue field $k$ , and is a localization of a $k$ -algebra of finite type. Furthermore, the module $\Omega_{B/k}$ of differentials of $B$ over $k$ is equal to the stalk $(\Omega_{X/k})_x$ of the sheaf $\Omega_{X/k}$ · Thus we can apply (8.8) and we see that $(\Omega_{X/k})_x$ is free of rank $n$ if and only if $B$ is a regular local ring. Now the theorem follows in view of (8.14A), which says any localization of a regular local ring at a prime ideal is again a regular local ring. and (Ex. 5.7), which says that $\Omega_{X/k}$ is locally free iff $(\Omega_{X/k})_y$ is free for all $y\in X$ . My confusion lies in the last sentence, I can see if $\Omega_{X/k}$ is a locally free sheaf of rank $n= \dim \ X$ , then by (Ex. 5.7), $(\Omega_{X/k})_x$ is free of rank $n$ for any closed point, thus $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ is a regular local ring at each closed point. Now apply (8.14A), we know $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ is a regular local ring at non-closed points, thus $X$ is nonsingular. However, I feel confused with the other direction: Suppose $X$ is smooth, then by (8.8), we know $(\Omega_{X/k})_x$ is free of rank $n$ for any closed point $x$ . But how do we show $(\Omega_{X/k})_x$ is free of rank $n$ for any nonclosed point? Here to apply (8.8), it requires $k(x)=k$ , but which is true for closed points. I don't think we can use (8.8) for non-closed points.","The theorem (p.177) from the Hartshorne's book ""Algebraic Geometry"" says: "" Let be an irreducible separated scheme of finite type over an algebraically closed field .
