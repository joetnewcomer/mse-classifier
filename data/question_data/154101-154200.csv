Help would be appreciated. EDIT: Here's what I've done in my proof so far (I need help finalizing case 2) First note that for $p_0=13$, we can express all integers $7 \leq n \leq 2p_0=26$ as a sum of distinct primes less than or equal to $13$.  Now, we will prove that we can construct these sums indefinitely. Assume we know some prime $p'$ exists such that every integer $7\leq n \leq 2p'$ can be expressed as a sum of distinct primes less than or equal to $p'$. Then, by Bertrand's postulate, there exists a prime $p$ such that $p'<p<2p'$. We claim now that every integer $7\leq n \leq 2p$ can be written as a sum of distinct primes less than or equal to $p$. Consider the two following cases Case 1: $2p'-p\geq 7$, hence $2p'\geq p+7$ so the terms $p,p+1,\dots,p+7$ are less than or equal to $2p'$ which means they can be written as a sum of distinct primes $\leq p'$ by hypothesis. It is left to check whether the terms $p+8,p+9,\dots, 2p$ satisfy our claim. Note if we subtract $p$ from every term in the arithmetic progression above, it becomes $8,9,\dots, p<2p'$ which shows that each term can be written as the sum of $p$ plus some other distinct primes less than or equal to $p'<p$ by hypothesis. Case 2: $2p'-p\leq 6$, hence $2p'\leq p+6$. Here we can see all terms $p+7,\dots, 2p$ satisfy our claim along with $p+2,p+3$ and $p+5$ by a similar argument as in Case 1. I'm not sure how to deal with $p+1,p+4,$ and $p+6$ though. EDIT: Oh, since any prime $p \geq 13$ is odd, then the only possible values for $2p'$ in Case 2 are $p+1,p+3$ and $p+5$, so I don't have to worry about the other cases. I think I'm done!

(a) Prove that the ideal class group is cyclic, generated by the class containing $P$. (b) Prove that the number of ideal classes is a multiple of $3$.

So, I tried to generalize his answer. I tried to obtain the distribution in $[0,1]$ of the fractional parts of the numbers $n/1, n/2, .... n/n$ as $n$ tends to $\infty$ . There may be many applications like computing the limit of ${1\over n}(\sum_k [an/k] - \sum_k n/k)$ as $n$ tends to $\infty$ . My overall question is: do you think the following informal argument makes sense? (of course, there should be much more work to make it a formal proof). Fix an integer $n>1$ , which is in fact assumed to be large. Let $\alpha$ be another positive large number. Building upon the argument of X-Rui, we have for ${\alpha\over \alpha+1} n < k \leq n$ , there holds $1\leq {n\over k} < 1 + {1\over \alpha}$ for ${\alpha\over \alpha+2}n < k \leq {\alpha\over \alpha+1}n$ , there holds $1+{1\over \alpha}\leq {n\over k} < 1 + {2\over \alpha}$ . for ${\alpha\over \alpha+3}n < k \leq {\alpha\over \alpha+2}n$ , there holds $1+{2\over \alpha}\leq {n\over k} < 1 + {3\over \alpha}$ . . . . for ${\alpha\over 2\alpha}n < k \leq {\alpha\over 2\alpha-1}$ there holds $2 - {1\over \alpha} \leq {n\over k} < 2$ for ${\alpha\over 2\alpha+1} n < k \leq {\alpha \over 2\alpha}$ , there holds $2\leq {n\over k} < 2 + {1\over \alpha}$ and so on. Hence, if $q$ is a number between $1$ and $\alpha-1$ , the fractional part of $n/k$ will lie between ${q-1\over \alpha}$ and ${q\over \alpha}$ whenever ${n\alpha \over m\alpha + q} < k \leq {n\alpha\over m\alpha+q-1}$ , with $m = 1, 2,3,...$ . So, as $n$ becomes very large, the proportion of these fractional parts among the fractional parts of $n/1,n/2,... n/n$ will tend to $$ S = \alpha \sum_{m=1}^\infty {1\over m\alpha+q-1} - {1\over m\alpha + q} = \sum_m {1\over m + {q\over \alpha}-{1\over \alpha}} - {1\over m + {q\over \alpha}}.$$ Since $\alpha$ has been assumed to be large, we can use the formula ${1\over x-\varepsilon}-{1\over x} \approx {\varepsilon\over x^2}$ to get $$ S \approx \sum_m \bigg({1\over m+{q\over \alpha}}\bigg)^2 {1\over \alpha}.$$ Now, in order to have a continuous distribution, we replace ${q\over \alpha}$ by $x$ , and $1\over \alpha$ by $dx$ , to obtain $$d\phi = \sum_m {1\over (x+m)^2} dx, $$ where $\phi$ is the cumulative function of the desired distribution. In other words, the density of this distribution is $$\varphi(x) = \sum_m {1\over (m+x)^2}.$$ My secondary question is: does the above sum have a known analytic form? Note: the above function is indeed a distribution density (actually it is the folded distribution of the ditribution $1/(1+x)^2$ in $[0, \infty)$ ): to see that, we have only to check that $\int_0^1 \varphi(x) dx = 1$ : We have $$S_m = \int_0^1 {1\over (m+x)^2} = {1\over m} - {1\over m+1} = {1\over m(m+1)}.$$ Hence $\sum_{m\geq 1} S_m < \infty$ and $\int_0^1\varphi(x)dx = \sum_m S_m$ .

We also know that this sequence must contain infinitely large numbers, since there are no primes between $n!+2$ and $n! + n$. Is it true that every even number occurs as a prime gap?",,['number-theory']
85,Find a short expression for a given large integer,Find a short expression for a given large integer,,"Give a single large number $N$, and a small set of operations and functions (in my case usually, +, -, *, ^, and $V(p,q,n),$ the nth term of  the Lucas sequence generated by $p$ and $q$), is there a clever way to find a very short expression for $N$ using these operations/functions plus small integers?   If so, I'd like to know this clever way; if not, I'd like a hint how we know there is not.

Obviously we can not write every with 72 characters--but what about a given $N$?  Can we know? Simple Example : given the prime 92709463146717245465044514107163, we might choose the short expression $3^{67}-2^{70}$. Motivation : I run a web site which lists the largest known primes. Today, to make the list of the top 5000 a prime must have 223,656 digits.  Most of these primes have very specific forms, most often $a\cdot b^n\pm1$, but sometimes something with more character like the prime $$2^{810655} + 2 V(1, 2, 810653) + 1$$ (244032 digits), or the prime $$(121227 \cdot 2^{384976} + 3)^2 + 24398127601 \cdot 2^{384962}$$ (231,789 digits).  Occasionally folks are purposefully (or accidentally) obtuse, and try to submit the digits instead of a simple form.  Usually I can find a simple form by playing with the numbed a bit in Maple. Another time a mathematician submitted what they claimed (at the time) was ""the largest known prime with no special form,"" a claim I did not know how to check, yet still I wondered: can I shorten this expression enough to fit on a list that only allows a 100 or so characters? A couple dozen new large primes are submitted each day so I have tried to automate most things.  So I wonder, can the task mentioned above be automated (or at the least be sped up with mathematical insight)? Fortunately folks are rarely this obtuse and often just threatening to delete their prime is often enough for them to give me a nicer form, but sometimes they do not know of one (e.g., an ECPP record prime which makes the list by being of the 20 largest known (proven this way), even though these records are only about 10k digits). But more than the practical question, I am just interested in the question: can we know if there is a very short form (using specified operations/functions/small integers) exists?  (What might be the shortest we can hope for?) A Programming question? Perhaps, but surely a good program would be guided by some mathematical principles.  There must be something better than my usual brute force method using a greedy algorithm (e.g., subtracting large terms of the form $a\cdot b^n$ and then iterating). Perhaps I just need help phrasing the question as surely someone has asked this, I just could not find it.
