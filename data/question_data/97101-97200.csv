I want to talk about domain $D$ and its image by map $g$. Please check it: I am not sure that I am taking right domain. ??",,"['complex-geometry', 'complex-analysis']"

The other formula yields a similar result. But now what? I still have no idea how to prove that there are finitely many positive $n$ such that the aforementioned equality holds.

This is how the problem was given: Find the Laurent Series Expansion for $\displaystyle f(z)=\frac{ze^{z}}{(z-2)^{2}}$ on the region $0<|z-2|<R$ . I can see it has a pole at $z_{0}=2$ of order $n=2$ . I understand we can write the Laurent Series for $0<|z-z_{0}|<R$ of a pole of order $n$ as the following: $\displaystyle \frac{a_{-n}}{(z-z_{0})^{n}} + \frac{a_{-(n-1)}}{(z-z_{0})^{n-1}} + \cdots +\frac{a_{-1}}{(z-z_{0})} + a_{0} + a_{1}(z-z_{0}) + a_{2}(z-z_{0})^{2} + a_{3}(z-z_{0})^{3} +\cdots$ With $z_{0}=2\text{, and }n=2$ we would find the following Laurent Series: $\displaystyle \frac{a_{-2}}{(z-2)^{2}} + \frac{a_{-1}}{(z-2)} + a_{0} + a_{1}(z-2) + a_{2}(z-2)^{2} + a_{3}(z-2)^{3}\cdots$ If I understand correctly we stop at $-2$ on the negative side because all $n<-2$ returns a zero for that coefficient.  However, on the positive side we take $n\to \infty$ so we can rewrite the series with $z_{0}=2\text{, and }n=2$ plugged in and get the following: $$\displaystyle \frac{a_{-2}}{(z-2)^{2}} + \frac{a_{-1}}{(z-2)} + a_{0} + a_{1}(z-2) + a_{2}(z-2)^{2} + a_{3}(z-2)^{3}\cdots$$ $$=\sum_{n=-2}^{-1}a_{n}(z-2)^{n} + \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}(z-2)^{n}$$ This is where I get confused.  I see in my text that for a simple pole we can find: using $\displaystyle f(z)=\frac{ze^{z}}{(z-2)^{2}}$ (I included the simple pole because the book explicitly states this is $a_{-1}$ , but I know this does not apply to a pole of order $n$ ) $\displaystyle a_{-1}=\text{Res}(f(z),z_{0})=\lim\limits_{z\to z_{0}}(z-z_{0})f(z)$ and for the Residue at a Pole of order $n$ we have $\displaystyle \text{Res}(f(z),z_{0})=\frac{1}{(n-1)!}\lim\limits_{z\to z_{0}}\left(\frac{d^{n-1}}{dz^{n-1}}\left[(z-z_{0})f(z)\right]\right)$ But what coefficient is the Residue of a Pole of order $n$ ? $a_{-2}\text{ or }a_{-1}$ ? and what if the pole had a greater order, $n>2$ , resulting in many more $a_{-n}$ terms?

Second part - the arc of the circle which we'll parametrize $ Re^{i\theta},\thinspace\thinspace\thinspace0\leq\theta\leq\frac{2\pi}{3} $ And the last part, a ray from the origin with phase $2\pi/3 $ and length R (the radius of this pizza slice), which we'll parametrize $ xe^{i\frac{2\pi}{3}}\thinspace\thinspace\thinspace0\leq x\leq R $ So we get $$ \intop_{\gamma}\frac{1}{z^{6}+z^{3}+1}dz=\intop_{0}^{R}\frac{1}{x^{6}+x^{3}+1}dx-\intop_{0}^{R}\frac{e^{i\frac{2\pi}{3}}}{x^{6}+x^{3}+1}dx+\intop_{0}^{\frac{2\pi}{3}}\frac{Rie^{i\theta}}{R^{6}e^{6i\theta}+R^{3}e^{3i\theta}+1}d\theta $$ And notice that $$ \intop_{0}^{\frac{2\pi}{3}}\frac{Rie^{i\theta}}{R^{6}e^{6i\theta}+R^{3}e^{3i\theta}+1}d\theta \to 0 $$ When $ R \to \infty $ .

78,"Set of branch points isn't discrete, but branch points are isolated?","Set of branch points isn't discrete, but branch points are isolated?",,"I refer to Chapter II.4 of Rick Miranda - Algebraic curves and Riemann surfaces , which I understand says that the branch points of a nonconstant holomorphic map $F: X \to Y$ between Riemann surfaces $X$ and $Y$ , both of which are not necessarily compact, form a discrete subset of range $Y$ of the map $F$ . (Not sure if 'connected' is part of the definition of Riemann surfaces in other textbooks, but it is here.) Question 1 : Do I understand correctly, and is this indeed true? What else I understand: $A$ is a discrete subspace/subset (I just assume everything here is the usual subspace topology) of $B$ if and only if every singleton subset of $A$ is open in $A$ if and only if every point of $A$ is isolated. This overflow question ( Basic question about branch points on Riemann surfaces ) seems to suggest this is not true but is true if $F$ is proper. However, I'm not sure the definitions of Riemann surface are the same (maybe some answers use definitions where Riemann surfaces are not necessarily connected or something). 2.1. I know $F$ is 'discrete' (meaning that its fibres are discrete; here, i refer to a different text ): see definition before Lemma 3.1, on p. 7), by Proposition II.3.12, and open, by open mapping theorem, which is Proposition II.3.8, but I'm not sure these help show $F$ is proper or are otherwise helpful. Ostensibly 'discrete' maps don't map discrete subsets to discrete subsets. This stackexchange question ( Are branch points always isolated? ) seems to suggest this is true. I think this is true if $F$ is injective or at least something like locally injective. (Please don't make me type up all the stuff I did for this part.) However based on the question in (3) and based on the '3.2. Branch points' on p. 7 in text by Armin Rainer in (2.1) , which I think uses the term 'branch points' to mean the same thing as what Miranda means by 'ramification points' (and thus is different from Miranda's 'branch points'), it seems that no neighbourhood $U$ of a ramification point $p \in U \subseteq X$ of $F$ is such that the restriction $F|_U$ is injective. Kinda related: If $F$ has a ramification point, then is $F$ necessarily not injective? This page ( rigtriv: Hurwitz’s Theorem ) says Now, the ramification and branch points must form a discrete set I don't think the page assumes anything like $F$ is proper. The Armin Rainer text in (2.1) actually seems to assume proper based on the '3.7. Proper holomorphic maps' part, but said part refers to 'Lemma 3.17', so I think proper can be replaced with closed. Maybe $F$ is closed or something. Kinda related (see Question 2 below): When closed and continuous maps discrete to discrete S. K. Donaldson - Riemann Surfaces says If $F$ is proper then the image $\Delta = F(R)$ is discrete in $Y$ . This seems to have all the same assumptions as with Miranda. Ostensibly, either Miranda is wrong or there's some higher level machinery that allows us to omit $F$ proper. Question 2 : To possibly generalise this, what are the minimum requirements on $F, X$ and $Y$ to make $F$ map discrete subsets to discrete subsets? I mean, I'm not sure we really need 'holomorphic' here. I have a feeling this applies perhaps to maps that are just open/closed, continuous and discrete and spaces that are just Hausdorff and locally compact or something. (again) Kinda related: When closed and continuous maps discrete to discrete","I refer to Chapter II.4 of Rick Miranda - Algebraic curves and Riemann surfaces , which I understand says that the branch points of a nonconstant holomorphic map between Riemann surfaces and , both of which are not necessarily compact, form a discrete subset of range of the map . (Not sure if 'connected' is part of the definition of Riemann surfaces in other textbooks, but it is here.) Question 1 : Do I understand correctly, and is this indeed true? What else I understand: is a discrete subspace/subset (I just assume everything here is the usual subspace topology) of if and only if every singleton subset of is open in if and only if every point of is isolated. This overflow question ( Basic question about branch points on Riemann surfaces ) seems to suggest this is not true but is true if is proper. However, I'm not sure the definitions of Riemann surface are the same (maybe some answers use definitions where Riemann surfaces are not necessarily connected or something). 2.1. I know is 'discrete' (meaning that its fibres are discrete; here, i refer to a different text ): see definition before Lemma 3.1, on p. 7), by Proposition II.3.12, and open, by open mapping theorem, which is Proposition II.3.8, but I'm not sure these help show is proper or are otherwise helpful.

So problem reduces to show that $|z|=1$ whenever $\frac{2z}{z^2-z+1}\in \mathbb{R}$ I put $z=a+ib$ and then rationalise to get the imaginary part of $\frac{2z}{z^2-z+1}$ be $\frac{b-b^3-a^2b}{something}$ . I equated this to zero and got my answer. Is there any better method?","This question already has answers here : If $ \frac {z^2 + z+ 1} {z^2 -z +1}$ is purely real then $|z|=$?

97,Conformal automorphism of unit disk that interchanges two given points,Conformal automorphism of unit disk that interchanges two given points,,"Let $a$ and $b$ be distinct points in the unit disk $D$ . Show that there exists a conformal automorphism $f$ of $D$ that interchanges $a$ and $b$ ; that is, $f(a) = b$ and $f(b) = a$ . Idea: we know that $g(z)=\frac{\alpha-z}{1-\bar{\alpha}z}$ interchanges $0$ and $\alpha$ and by composition we can find out the map $f(a) = b$ for any $a$ and $b$ in the unit disk $D$ . But how can I get the other way by the same map? Thanks.","Let and be distinct points in the unit disk . Show that there exists a conformal automorphism of that interchanges and ; that is, and .

99,Equivalence of two definitions of simple connectedness.,Equivalence of two definitions of simple connectedness.,,"I am an undergraduate in mathematics, self-studying complex analysis. In Bak, Newman - Complex Analysis , there is the following definition: An open connected set $D \subset \mathbb{C}$ is simply connected if its complement is ""connected within $\epsilon$ to $\infty$ "". That is, for any $z_0 \in \mathbb{C}-D$ and $\epsilon>0$ , there exists a continuous curve $\gamma :[0,\infty) \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ such that (a) $d(\gamma(t), \mathbb{C}-D) <\epsilon $ for all $t \geq 0$ , (b) $\gamma(0)= z_0$ , (c) $\lim _{t\rightarrow \infty} \gamma(t) = \infty$ . I blowed up my mind, since in my topology class I learned the following definition: A simply connected space is a path-connected space whose fundamental group vanish. How can I prove that these two seemingly very different definitions are actually equivalent(if it is indeed equivalent)?","I am an undergraduate in mathematics, self-studying complex analysis.
