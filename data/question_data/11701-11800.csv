0,A function whose partial derivatives exist at a point but is not continuous,A function whose partial derivatives exist at a point but is not continuous,,"I am asked to determine whether or not a function can have all of its partial derivatives exist at a point but not be continuous at that point. I have tried to construct a counterexample but am unsure whether or not I have succeeded. Consider the following function: $$ f(x,y) = \left\{ \begin{array}{cc} x & y=0 \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{array}\right. $$ Let $(x_0,y_0) \not= 0$ then we can compute the partials of $f$ at this point. Doing so is not difficult we just have to make sure we are careful about the partials with respect to $y$. $$ \begin{align*} f_x(x_0,y_0) &= \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x_0+h,y_0)-f(x_0,y_0)}{h} \\  \text{if $y_0=0$} & \implies \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{x_0+h-x_0}{h} = 1 \\ \text{if $y_0\not=0$} &\implies \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{0}{h} = 0 \\ f_y(x_0,y_0) &= \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x_0,y_0+h)-f(x_0,y_0)}{h} \\ \text{if $y_0=0$} &\implies \lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{x_0-x_0}{h} = 0 \\ \text{if $y_0\not=0$} &\implies \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{0}h = 0 \end{align*} $$ In all of these cases the partials of $f$ exist, however it is clear that for $x_0\not=0$ we will have that $f$ is not continuous at $(x_0,0)$. Becuase along any path where $y\not=0$ we will have that the limit is $0$, but along the path $y=0$ we obtain the limit being $x_0$. So $f$ is not continuous, but its partials exist. Is this a valid construction? It felt kind of fishy, any advice would be appreciated.","I am asked to determine whether or not a function can have all of its partial derivatives exist at a point but not be continuous at that point.

1,Why does the Hessian work?,Why does the Hessian work?,,"I am working through Leonard Susskind's The Theoretical Minimum (on physics, but it also includes some maths).

My question is that although the relationship is exact at the sampled data points assuming they are equally spaced(say they are equally spaced in time) how can we say about the accuracy of the transform that is if we transform into frequency-domain both with DFT and AFT how will the coefficients for a particular frequency be related?

This substitution is constructed by letting: $$t = \tan\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) \iff x = 2\arctan(t)  \iff dx = \frac{2}{t^2+1}$$ Using basic trigonometric identities it is easy to prove that: $$\cos x = \dfrac{1 - t^2}{1 +  t^2}$$ $$\sin x = \dfrac{2t}{1 + t^2}$$ But I couldn't express $\ln(x)$ in terms of $t$ . Attempt 2 I tried using integration by parts but I couldn't find a workaround, it gets more complicated, really fast. $$ \int \frac{dx}{\sin(\ln(x))} \ = x \sin(\ln(x)) - \int \frac{\cot \left(\ln \left(x\right)\right)}{x\sin \left(\ln \left(x\right)\right)} $$ Attempt 3 The most logical substitution I could think of. It doesn't seem to lead anywhere though. Let, $\ln(x) = u \iff dx = \, e^u du$ $$ (1) \iff \int \frac{dx}{\sin(\ln(x))} = \int \frac{e^u}{\sin(u)} du = \int \frac{(e^u)'}{\sin(u)} du = $$ $$ \frac{(e^u)'}{\sin(u)} - \int e^u \left(\frac{1}{\sin(u)}\right)' = \frac{(e^u)'}{\sin(u)} - \int e^u \frac{\cos(u)}{\sin^2(u)} =  ?$$ Attempt 4 A combination of attempts 1,2, 3. Let $\ln(x) = t$ then $dx = e^t dt$ , therefore, $$\int \frac{dx}{\sin(\ln(x))} dx = \int \frac{e^t }{\sin(t)}dt \quad (1)$$ Let's first evaluate $$ \int \frac{1\:}{\sin\left(t\right)}dt \quad (2)$$ Using the Weierstrass substitution $$ t = \arctan(\frac{x}{2})$$ it is easy to prove that $$ (2) = \int \frac{1\:}{\sin\left(t\right)}dt= \ln \left|\tan \left(\frac{t}{2}\right)\right|+C$$ Therefore, $$ (1) \iff I = \int e^x\left(\ln \:\left|\tan \:\left(\frac{t}{2}\right)\right|\right)'dt = e^x \ln \:\left|\tan \:\left(\frac{t}{2}\right)\right| - \int (e^x)' \ln \:\left|\tan \:\left(\frac{t}{2}\right)\right|dt = $$ $$  e^x \ln \:\left|\tan \:\left(\frac{t}{2}\right)\right| - \left( e^x \ln \:\left|\tan \:\left(\frac{t}{2}\right)\right|  - \int e^x \left(\ln \:\left|\tan \:\left(\frac{t}{2}\right)\right|\right)'dt \right) $$ $$ I = 0 + I \iff 0=0$$ Tautology.

50,Can I derive the formula for expected value of continuous random variables from the discrete case?,Can I derive the formula for expected value of continuous random variables from the discrete case?,,"I've previously asked the question on Stats SE, but I guess it fits the Math SE better. Is it possible to rigorously derive the formula for expected value of continuous random variable starting with expected variable in discrete case, i.e. $$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n}p_i x_i$$ to obtain $$E[X]=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}xf(x)dx$$ When formulating the definition for continuous case, the intention was, I believe, to make it 'equivalent' to the discrete case. So for example, I'd like $E[X]$ of a continuous random variable $X$ to be equal to the sum of every possible value of $X$ times probability of that particular value. The problem is that the probability of any particular value of $X$ is $0$, and the expected value calculated that way would always be $0$. But some people tried to convince me that it's possible overcome these issues with help of Lebesgue integral. Could anyone explain intuitively how is that possible? I'm convinced that no matter what integration we use, we cannot somehow magically assign non-zero probabilities to single values the random variable $X$ might take. They will always be $0$! Or maybe there's no magic involved and best we can do is work with infinitely thin intervals of $X$? From what I've managed to find out (I don't have time to study all measure theory and Lebesgue integration at the moment to figure it out on my own) it's about approximating the original continuous random variable $X$ with step function, and the more steps there are, the better is the approximation. But still, all we have is calculating probability of intervals (they are infinitely thin though, but they are intervals anyway). The fact that something gets closer and closer to original function in the limit doesn't mean it behaves the same as the original function (check the very popular example here ). In the 'very popular example' above, even though the curve approaches the circle, its length will never be the same as the perimeter of that circle.  Similarly, here , in 'The Riemann-Stieltjes integral: intuition' part. they say the discrete r.v. $X_n$ converges to continuous r.v. $X$, as $n \to \infty$, in the limit it becomes the same variable. So it's important to ask whether it's reasonable to expect the approximation of the cont. r.v. $X$ to behave the same as the original random variable $X$, even if in the limit the are 'indistinguishable' in the limit, whatever that word means in mathematics. The curve and circle are indistinguishable too, but still have different properties. So apparently it's that the continuous case is not derived from discrete case, but is a generalization of the discrete case. I guess in every mathematical theory, there is no such thing as 'the only correct' generalization, so the contunous formula could look different. If you claim this is the only 'valid one', then shouldn't we call it a derivation of the formula?","I've previously asked the question on Stats SE, but I guess it fits the Math SE better.

So it's important to ask whether it's reasonable to expect the approximation of the cont. r.v. $X$ to behave the same as the original random variable $X$, even if in the limit the are 'indistinguishable' in the limit, whatever that word means in mathematics. The curve and circle are indistinguishable too, but still have different properties. So apparently it's that the continuous case is not derived from discrete case, but is a generalization of the discrete case. I guess in every mathematical theory, there is no such thing as 'the only correct' generalization, so the contunous formula could look different. If you claim this is the only 'valid one', then shouldn't we call it a derivation of the formula?",,"['calculus', 'probability', 'lebesgue-integral']"

58,Proving the continued fraction representation of $\sqrt{2}$,Proving the continued fraction representation of,\sqrt{2},"There's a question in Spivak's Calculus ( I don't happen to have the question number in front of me in the 2nd Edition, it's Chapter 21, Problem 7) that develops the concept of continued fraction, specifically the continued fraction representation of $\sqrt{2}$.  Having only recently become aware of continued fractions, I'm trying to work my way through this problem, but I'm stuck at the very last stage. Here's what I've got so far:  Let $\{a_n\}$ be the sequence defined recursively as $$a_1 = 1, a_{n + 1} = 1 + \frac{1}{1 + a_n}$$  Consider the two subsequences $\{a_{2n}\}$ and $\{a_{2n - 1}\}$.  I've already shown that $\{a_{2n}\}$ is monotonic, strictly decreasing, and bounded below by $\sqrt{2}$, and similarly I've shown that $\{a_{2n - 1}\}$ is monotonic, strictly increasing, and bounded above by $\sqrt{2}$.  Obviously, both of these subsequences converge. Although of course in general, if two subsequences of a sequence happen to converge to the same value, that doesn't guarantee that the sequence itself converges at all (much less to that same value), in the case where the subsequences are $\{a_{2n}\}$ and $\{a_{2n - 1}\}$, it's easy to show that if they both converge to the same value, then so will $\{a_n\}$ (since every term of $\{a_n\}$ is a term of one of the two subsequences).  So no problem there. In other words, it remains only to show that not only do the subsequences converge, but they converge to $\sqrt{2}$ in particular.  Take, for starters, $\{a_{2n - 1}\}$ (if I can get $\{a_{2n - 1}\}$ to converge to $\sqrt{2}$, I'm sure getting $\{a_{2n}\}$ to converge to $\sqrt{2}$ won't be very different).  Because it's strictly increasing and bounded above by $\sqrt{2}$, it converges to some number $x \leq \sqrt{2}$.  Suppose that $x < \sqrt{2}$.  We want to show this doesn't happen. But this is where I'm getting stuck.  I feel like I want to take $\epsilon = \sqrt{2} - x$ and show that there exists some $N$ such that $a_{2N - 1} > x$, which would finish the problem due to the monotonicity of $\{a_{2n - 1}\}$.  But this isn't working. Any hints?

I feel this is a very important question to understand as it touches on some crucial aspects of the covariant derivative. Show that (without torsion) $$\left(\nabla_c\nabla_d-\nabla_d\nabla_c\right)v^a=R_{bcd}^av^b\tag{1}$$ where $$R_{bcd}^a=\partial_c\Gamma_{bd}^a-\partial_d \Gamma_{bc}^a+\Gamma_{ec}^a\Gamma_{bd}^e-\Gamma_{ed}^a\Gamma_{bc}^e$$ is the Riemann curvature tensor. Hint: determine $\nabla_c\nabla_dv^a$ . I'm trying to understand the following solution to the question above: $$\nabla_c\nabla_dv^a=\partial_c\nabla_dv^a-\Gamma_{dc}^b\nabla_b v^a+\Gamma_{bc}^a\nabla_d v^b\tag{a}$$ $$=\partial_c\left(\partial_dv^a+\Gamma_{bd}^av^b\right)-\Gamma_{dc}^b\left(\partial_bv^a+\Gamma_{eb}^av^e\right)+\Gamma_{bc}^a\left(\partial_dv^b+\Gamma_{ed}^bv^e\right)\tag{b}$$ $$=\left(\partial_c\Gamma_{bd}^a\right)v^b+\Gamma_{bc}^a\Gamma_{ed}^bv^e + \text{contribution symmetric in $c$ and $d$ indices}\tag{c}$$ $$=\left(\partial_c\Gamma_{bd}^a\right)v^b+\Gamma_{ec}^a\Gamma_{bd}^ev^b + \text{contribution symmetric in $c$ and $d$ indices}\tag{d}$$ on exchanging dummy $b$ and $e$ indices in the second term. Subtracting $\nabla_d\nabla_cv^a$ gives the stated result. In order for me to make sense of the author's solution, I need to understand each of the four equalities, $(\mathrm{a})-(\mathrm{d})$ , in turn. So starting with $(\mathrm{a})$ , for a contravariant vector field $v^a(x)$ , the covariant derivative, $\nabla_{\text{cov}}$ is defined through $$\nabla_{\text{cov}}v^a=\partial_{\text{cov}}v^a+\Gamma_{b,\,{\text{cov}}}^av^b\tag{2}$$ Similarly, for a covariant vector field $v_b(x)$ , the covariant derivative, $\nabla_{\text{cov}}$ is defined through $$\nabla_{\text{cov}}v_b=\partial_{\text{cov}}v_b-\Gamma_{b,\,{\text{cov}}}^av_a\tag{3}$$ [Please note that I have purposely used ' $\mathrm{cov}$ ' to represent the index for the covariant derivative, this was done to avoid writing say, ' $\nabla_c$ ', which would cause confusion with the notation that follows]. For a tensor field of type $(1,1)$ , $T_b^a$ , the covariant derivative of this tensor field, $\nabla_c$ is $$\nabla_c T_b^a=\partial_c T_{b}^a+\Gamma_{cd}^a T_{b}^d-\Gamma_{bc}^e T_{e}^a \tag{4}$$ Since the gradient of a vector field is a tensor (field), let the tensor (field) of type $(1,1)$ be $T_d^a=\nabla_d v^a$ . Now, using the hint at the end of the question and eqn $(4)$ , $$\begin{align}\nabla_c\left(\nabla_dv^a\right)&=\nabla_cT_d^a\\&=\partial_cT_d^a+\Gamma_{bc}^aT_d^b-\Gamma_{cd}^e T_e^a\\&=\partial_c\nabla_dv^a+\Gamma_{bc}^a\nabla_dv^b-\Gamma_{cd}^e \nabla_ev^a\tag{5}\end{align}$$ and this is the equivalent of $(\mathrm{a})$ in the author's solution. The next equality, $(\mathrm{b})$ , can be found by direct substitution of eqn $(2)$ into $(5)$ . To try to understand the last two equalities, $(\mathrm{c})-(\mathrm{d})$ , I multiply out eqn $(\mathrm{b})$ : $$\begin{align}\nabla_c\nabla_dv^a &=\partial_c\left(\partial_dv^a+\Gamma_{bd}^av^b\right)-\Gamma_{dc}^b\left(\partial_bv^a+\Gamma_{eb}^av^e\right)+\Gamma_{bc}^a\left(\partial_dv^b+\Gamma_{ed}^bv^e\right)\\&=\partial_c\partial_dv^a+\partial_c\Gamma_{bd}^av^b-\Gamma_{dc}^b\partial_bv^a-\Gamma_{dc}^b\Gamma_{eb}^av^e+\Gamma_{bc}^a\partial_dv^b+\Gamma_{bc}^a\Gamma_{ed}^bv^e\tag{6}\\& \stackrel{\color{red}{?}}{=}\left(\partial_c\Gamma_{bd}^a\right)v^b+\Gamma_{bc}^a\Gamma_{ed}^bv^e+ \text{contribution symmetric in $c$ and $d$ indices}\tag{7}\end{align}$$ But the final equality (marked with a red question mark above the equals sign) can only be true if out of the six terms in eqn $(6)$ we have $$\partial_c\partial_dv^a=-\Gamma_{dc}^b\partial_bv^a=\Gamma_{bc}^a\partial_dv^b=0\tag{8}$$ and therefore I identify $$-\Gamma_{dc}^b\Gamma_{eb}^av^e\tag{9}$$ as the contribution symmetric in $c$ and $d$ indices in $(7)$ . I'll reserve asking about part $(\mathrm{d})$ for now until I have understood part $(\mathrm{c})$ . So my questions about eqn $(\mathrm{c})$ are: What justifies those particular three terms from eqn $(6)$ being equal to zero in $(8)$ , and why are the others non-zero? Is $(9)$ the unidentified symmetric contribution in the $c$ and $d$ indices eluded to $(7)$ ? Here I embed images of the question and its' solution in case I made any typos while typesetting this post: and here is the solution: Update: Even though a good answer has already been provided the part I still can't understand is the resulting expression $(\mathrm{c})$ : $$\nabla_c\nabla_dv^a=\left(\partial_c\Gamma_{bd}^a\right)v^b+\Gamma_{bc}^a\Gamma_{ed}^bv^e + \text{contribution symmetric in $c$ and $d$ indices}$$ I understand how $(\mathrm{d})$ was obtained from $(\mathrm{c})$ but since my question revolves almost entirely about how to get from eqn $(\mathrm{b})$ to $(\mathrm{c})$ , for the purposes of this question and to stay consistent with the answer given by @ContraKinta I will use eqn $(\mathrm{c})$ . I think the line ""contribution symmetric in $c$ and $d$ indices"" is the part causing me the most confusion. For instance, if I were to explicitly write down these 'symmetric contributions' when indices $c$ is switched with $d$ and vice versa then I think the resulting expression should be: $$\nabla_c\nabla_dv^a=\left(\partial_c\Gamma_{bd}^a\right)v^b+\Gamma_{bc}^a\Gamma_{ed}^bv^e+\left(\partial_{\color{blue}{d}}\Gamma_{b\color{red}{c}}^a\right)v^b+\Gamma_{b \color{blue}{d}}^a\Gamma_{e\color{red}{c}}^bv^e\tag{e}$$ Where the third and fourth terms are just the first and second terms repeated, respectively, but with the positions of the $d$ and $c$ indices interchanged, as marked by the blue and red colors, respectively. But this is not what I see when I look at the full expression for $\nabla_c\nabla_dv^a$ : $$\nabla_c\nabla_dv^a=\underbrace{\partial_c\nabla_dv^a}_{(\mathrm{f})}-\underbrace{\Gamma_{dc}^b\nabla_b v^a}_{(\mathrm{g})}+\underbrace{\Gamma_{bc}^a\nabla_d v^b}_{(\mathrm{h})}$$ $$=\partial_c\left(\partial_dv^a+\Gamma_{bd}^av^b\right)-\Gamma_{dc}^b\left(\partial_bv^a+\Gamma_{eb}^av^e\right)+\Gamma_{bc}^a\left(\partial_dv^b+\Gamma_{ed}^bv^e\right)$$ $$=\partial_c\partial_dv^a+\left(\partial_c\Gamma_{bd}^a\right)v^b+\Gamma_{bd}^a\partial_cv^b\tag{f}$$ $$-\Gamma_{dc}^b\partial_bv^a-\Gamma_{dc}^b\Gamma_{eb}^av^e\tag{g}$$ $$+\Gamma_{bc}^a\partial_dv^b+\Gamma_{bc}^a\Gamma_{ed}^bv^e\tag{h}$$ $$=\fbox{$\partial_c\partial_dv^a+\left(\partial_c\Gamma_{bd}^a\right)v^b-\Gamma_{dc}^b\partial_bv^a-\Gamma_{dc}^b\Gamma_{eb}^av^e+\Gamma_{bc}^a\Gamma_{ed}^bv^e+\Gamma_{bd}^a\partial_cv^b+\Gamma_{bc}^a\partial_dv^b$}$$ The labelled eqns ( $\mathrm{f}$ - $\mathrm{h}$ ) show the expansion of each of the terms above in the two equations above. There are in fact $7$ terms, the last two terms are symmetric in the $c$ and $d$ indices, that is, swapping the $c$ and $d$ indices in the 6th term of the boxed expression gives the 7th and final term, namely, $\Gamma_{bc}^a\partial_d  v^b$ . By comparing the boxed equation for $\nabla_c\nabla_dv^a$ and eqn $(\mathrm{c})$ , in fact, the only two terms common to both the boxed eqn and $(\mathrm{c})$ are the 2nd and 5th terms in the boxed eqn. So what happened to the other terms? More importantly, why did the 1st term, $\partial_c\partial_dv^a$ disappear? I can't invoke $\partial_c\partial_dv^a-\partial_d\partial_cv^a=0$ as explained in the answer as I have not subtracted off $\nabla_d\nabla_cv^a$ yet. For the sake of completeness I will now compute $\nabla_d\nabla_cv^a$ (though this is only for reference and is not needed to answer the questions I have here): $$\nabla_d\nabla_cv^a=\underbrace{\partial_d\nabla_cv^a}_{(\mathrm{i})}-\underbrace{\Gamma_{cd}^b\nabla_b v^a}_{(\mathrm{j})}+\underbrace{\Gamma_{bd}^a\nabla_c v^b}_{(\mathrm{k})}$$ $$=\partial_d\left(\partial_cv^a+\Gamma_{bc}^av^b\right)-\Gamma_{cd}^b\left(\partial_bv^a+\Gamma_{eb}^av^e\right)+\Gamma_{bd}^a\left(\partial_cv^b+\Gamma_{ec}^bv^e\right)$$ $$=\partial_d\partial_cv^a+\left(\partial_d\Gamma_{bc}^a\right)v^b+\Gamma_{bc}^a\partial_dv^b\tag{i}$$ $$-\Gamma_{cd}^b\partial_bv^a-\Gamma_{cd}^b\Gamma_{eb}^av^e\tag{j}$$ $$+\Gamma_{bd}^a\partial_cv^b+\Gamma_{bd}^a\Gamma_{ec}^bv^e\tag{k}$$ $$=\fbox{$\partial_d\partial_cv^a+\left(\partial_d\Gamma_{bc}^a\right)v^b-\Gamma_{cd}^b\partial_bv^a-\Gamma_{cd}^b\Gamma_{eb}^av^e+\Gamma_{bd}^a\Gamma_{ec}^bv^e+\Gamma_{bc}^a\partial_dv^b+\Gamma_{bd}^a\partial_cv^b$}$$ The eqns ( $\mathrm{i}$ - $\mathrm{k}$ ) simply represent expanded forms of the each of the terms in the equations above. I didn't want to resort to doing this and it was tedious to type this all out in full, but I did it for a reason: I am beginning to doubt myself on the validity of the boxed expressions I have worked out. For instance, what is to stop me writing the last term of the 2nd boxed expression as $\Gamma_{cd}^b\partial_bv^a$ ? This term has the same contravariant index as the LHS, $\nabla_d\nabla_cv^a$ , namely, $a$ and the same covariant indices, $d$ and $c$ on the LHS. So I know this may seem like a question in its' own right, but I consider it to be pertinent to this post, so does this mean that $\Gamma_{bd}^a\partial_cv^b=\Gamma_{cd}^b\partial_bv^a$ ? I never thought they could be equal but now I'm not so sure as the live indices are all preseved. Final remarks: Due to work commitments, I was unable to respond to this post or even self-study until now. My apologies for this and for an excessively long post, I laboured the point somewhat to convey my confusion in the most effective way I could think of. For these reasons I think that placing a bounty on this question is the least I could do. 2nd update addressing recent answers/comments: I see some very nice answers emerging, which, for the most part answers my main question; how to obtain eqn $(\mathrm{c})$ from $(\mathrm{b})$ . I would like to thank all participants for your kind help so far. One of the questions I asked that did go overlooked, was What is to stop me from writing the last term of the 2nd boxed expression as $\Gamma_{cd}^b\partial_bv^a$ ? This term has the same contravariant index as the LHS, $\nabla_d\nabla_cv^a$ , namely, $a$ and the same covariant indices, $d$ and $c$ on the LHS? In short, does the 7th (final) term of the second boxed expression satisfy $$\Gamma_{bd}^a\partial_cv^b=\Gamma_{cd}^b\partial_bv^a\tag{?}$$ If that was too vague, then put another way, am I at liberty to switch around whichever tensor indices I like (even if they belong to differential operators, etc), with the caveat that I preserve the overall labelling of the contravariant and covariant indices? If any term in the expression on the LHS or RHS has a contravariant index $a$ and covariant indices $d$ and $c$ as long as this is maintained throughout all other terms may I switch the indices to different factors of the terms ( $\Gamma_{bd}^a\partial_cv^b=\Gamma_{cd}^b\partial_bv^a$ )?","I'm going to be asking about parts of the author's solution to the following question.

So my questions about eqn are: What justifies those particular three terms from eqn being equal to zero in , and why are the others non-zero? Is the unidentified symmetric contribution in the and indices eluded to ? Here I embed images of the question and its' solution in case I made any typos while typesetting this post: and here is the solution: Update: Even though a good answer has already been provided the part I still can't understand is the resulting expression : I understand how was obtained from but since my question revolves almost entirely about how to get from eqn to , for the purposes of this question and to stay consistent with the answer given by @ContraKinta I will use eqn . I think the line ""contribution symmetric in and indices"" is the part causing me the most confusion. For instance, if I were to explicitly write down these 'symmetric contributions' when indices is switched with and vice versa then I think the resulting expression should be: Where the third and fourth terms are just the first and second terms repeated, respectively, but with the positions of the and indices interchanged, as marked by the blue and red colors, respectively. But this is not what I see when I look at the full expression for : The labelled eqns ( - ) show the expansion of each of the terms above in the two equations above. There are in fact terms, the last two terms are symmetric in the and indices, that is, swapping the and indices in the 6th term of the boxed expression gives the 7th and final term, namely, . By comparing the boxed equation for and eqn , in fact, the only two terms common to both the boxed eqn and are the 2nd and 5th terms in the boxed eqn. So what happened to the other terms? More importantly, why did the 1st term, disappear? I can't invoke as explained in the answer as I have not subtracted off yet. For the sake of completeness I will now compute (though this is only for reference and is not needed to answer the questions I have here): The eqns ( - ) simply represent expanded forms of the each of the terms in the equations above. I didn't want to resort to doing this and it was tedious to type this all out in full, but I did it for a reason: I am beginning to doubt myself on the validity of the boxed expressions I have worked out. For instance, what is to stop me writing the last term of the 2nd boxed expression as ? This term has the same contravariant index as the LHS, , namely, and the same covariant indices, and on the LHS. So I know this may seem like a question in its' own right, but I consider it to be pertinent to this post, so does this mean that ? I never thought they could be equal but now I'm not so sure as the live indices are all preseved. Final remarks: Due to work commitments, I was unable to respond to this post or even self-study until now. My apologies for this and for an excessively long post, I laboured the point somewhat to convey my confusion in the most effective way I could think of. For these reasons I think that placing a bounty on this question is the least I could do. 2nd update addressing recent answers/comments: I see some very nice answers emerging, which, for the most part answers my main question; how to obtain eqn from . I would like to thank all participants for your kind help so far. One of the questions I asked that did go overlooked, was What is to stop me from writing the last term of the 2nd boxed expression as ? This term has the same contravariant index as the LHS, , namely, and the same covariant indices, and on the LHS? In short, does the 7th (final) term of the second boxed expression satisfy If that was too vague, then put another way, am I at liberty to switch around whichever tensor indices I like (even if they belong to differential operators, etc), with the caveat that I preserve the overall labelling of the contravariant and covariant indices? If any term in the expression on the LHS or RHS has a contravariant index and covariant indices and as long as this is maintained throughout all other terms may I switch the indices to different factors of the terms ( )?","\left(\nabla_c\nabla_d-\nabla_d\nabla_c\right)v^a=R_{bcd}^av^b\tag{1} R_{bcd}^a=\partial_c\Gamma_{bd}^a-\partial_d \Gamma_{bc}^a+\Gamma_{ec}^a\Gamma_{bd}^e-\Gamma_{ed}^a\Gamma_{bc}^e \nabla_c\nabla_dv^a \nabla_c\nabla_dv^a=\partial_c\nabla_dv^a-\Gamma_{dc}^b\nabla_b v^a+\Gamma_{bc}^a\nabla_d v^b\tag{a} =\partial_c\left(\partial_dv^a+\Gamma_{bd}^av^b\right)-\Gamma_{dc}^b\left(\partial_bv^a+\Gamma_{eb}^av^e\right)+\Gamma_{bc}^a\left(\partial_dv^b+\Gamma_{ed}^bv^e\right)\tag{b} =\left(\partial_c\Gamma_{bd}^a\right)v^b+\Gamma_{bc}^a\Gamma_{ed}^bv^e + \text{contribution symmetric in c and d indices}\tag{c} =\left(\partial_c\Gamma_{bd}^a\right)v^b+\Gamma_{ec}^a\Gamma_{bd}^ev^b + \text{contribution symmetric in c and d indices}\tag{d} b e \nabla_d\nabla_cv^a (\mathrm{a})-(\mathrm{d}) (\mathrm{a}) v^a(x) \nabla_{\text{cov}} \nabla_{\text{cov}}v^a=\partial_{\text{cov}}v^a+\Gamma_{b,\,{\text{cov}}}^av^b\tag{2} v_b(x) \nabla_{\text{cov}} \nabla_{\text{cov}}v_b=\partial_{\text{cov}}v_b-\Gamma_{b,\,{\text{cov}}}^av_a\tag{3} \mathrm{cov} \nabla_c (1,1) T_b^a \nabla_c \nabla_c T_b^a=\partial_c T_{b}^a+\Gamma_{cd}^a T_{b}^d-\Gamma_{bc}^e T_{e}^a \tag{4} (1,1) T_d^a=\nabla_d v^a (4) \begin{align}\nabla_c\left(\nabla_dv^a\right)&=\nabla_cT_d^a\\&=\partial_cT_d^a+\Gamma_{bc}^aT_d^b-\Gamma_{cd}^e T_e^a\\&=\partial_c\nabla_dv^a+\Gamma_{bc}^a\nabla_dv^b-\Gamma_{cd}^e \nabla_ev^a\tag{5}\end{align} (\mathrm{a}) (\mathrm{b}) (2) (5) (\mathrm{c})-(\mathrm{d}) (\mathrm{b}) \begin{align}\nabla_c\nabla_dv^a &=\partial_c\left(\partial_dv^a+\Gamma_{bd}^av^b\right)-\Gamma_{dc}^b\left(\partial_bv^a+\Gamma_{eb}^av^e\right)+\Gamma_{bc}^a\left(\partial_dv^b+\Gamma_{ed}^bv^e\right)\\&=\partial_c\partial_dv^a+\partial_c\Gamma_{bd}^av^b-\Gamma_{dc}^b\partial_bv^a-\Gamma_{dc}^b\Gamma_{eb}^av^e+\Gamma_{bc}^a\partial_dv^b+\Gamma_{bc}^a\Gamma_{ed}^bv^e\tag{6}\\& \stackrel{\color{red}{?}}{=}\left(\partial_c\Gamma_{bd}^a\right)v^b+\Gamma_{bc}^a\Gamma_{ed}^bv^e+ \text{contribution symmetric in c and d indices}\tag{7}\end{align} (6) \partial_c\partial_dv^a=-\Gamma_{dc}^b\partial_bv^a=\Gamma_{bc}^a\partial_dv^b=0\tag{8} -\Gamma_{dc}^b\Gamma_{eb}^av^e\tag{9} c d (7) (\mathrm{d}) (\mathrm{c}) (\mathrm{c}) (6) (8) (9) c d (7) (\mathrm{c}) \nabla_c\nabla_dv^a=\left(\partial_c\Gamma_{bd}^a\right)v^b+\Gamma_{bc}^a\Gamma_{ed}^bv^e + \text{contribution symmetric in c and d indices} (\mathrm{d}) (\mathrm{c}) (\mathrm{b}) (\mathrm{c}) (\mathrm{c}) c d c d \nabla_c\nabla_dv^a=\left(\partial_c\Gamma_{bd}^a\right)v^b+\Gamma_{bc}^a\Gamma_{ed}^bv^e+\left(\partial_{\color{blue}{d}}\Gamma_{b\color{red}{c}}^a\right)v^b+\Gamma_{b \color{blue}{d}}^a\Gamma_{e\color{red}{c}}^bv^e\tag{e} d c \nabla_c\nabla_dv^a \nabla_c\nabla_dv^a=\underbrace{\partial_c\nabla_dv^a}_{(\mathrm{f})}-\underbrace{\Gamma_{dc}^b\nabla_b v^a}_{(\mathrm{g})}+\underbrace{\Gamma_{bc}^a\nabla_d v^b}_{(\mathrm{h})} =\partial_c\left(\partial_dv^a+\Gamma_{bd}^av^b\right)-\Gamma_{dc}^b\left(\partial_bv^a+\Gamma_{eb}^av^e\right)+\Gamma_{bc}^a\left(\partial_dv^b+\Gamma_{ed}^bv^e\right) =\partial_c\partial_dv^a+\left(\partial_c\Gamma_{bd}^a\right)v^b+\Gamma_{bd}^a\partial_cv^b\tag{f} -\Gamma_{dc}^b\partial_bv^a-\Gamma_{dc}^b\Gamma_{eb}^av^e\tag{g} +\Gamma_{bc}^a\partial_dv^b+\Gamma_{bc}^a\Gamma_{ed}^bv^e\tag{h} =\fbox{\partial_c\partial_dv^a+\left(\partial_c\Gamma_{bd}^a\right)v^b-\Gamma_{dc}^b\partial_bv^a-\Gamma_{dc}^b\Gamma_{eb}^av^e+\Gamma_{bc}^a\Gamma_{ed}^bv^e+\Gamma_{bd}^a\partial_cv^b+\Gamma_{bc}^a\partial_dv^b} \mathrm{f} \mathrm{h} 7 c d c d \Gamma_{bc}^a\partial_d

My thoughts: This is a definite integral, so there's no ""$+ C$"" constant of integration business going on. (Right?) Even if you end up having some $x$s in your expression because the $u$-substitution doesn't cancel them out, that doesn't matter because you're still integrating over an empty domain. (Right?) Plus, I can also get this to ""work"" with $\int_{y=-r}^{y=r} (r^2-y^2)^{-1/2}y^2\,dy$ with $u = r^2-y^2$, and that can be expressed as $\int_{u=0}^{u=0} u^{-1/2}\sqrt{r^2-u} \, du$, which is completely in terms of $u$.

The derivative of z with respect to t is: $$\frac{dz}{dt} = \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} \frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{\partial z}{\partial y} \frac{dy}{dt}$$ To compute this derivative, I was taught to draw a graph with the following edges: $x \to z$, $y \to z$, $t \to x$, and $t \to y$. Source: http://www.math.hmc.edu/calculus/tutorials/multichainrule/ These tree diagrams can be constructed for arbitrarily complex functions with many variables. In general, to find a derivative of a dependent variable with respect to an independent variable, you need to take the sum of all of the different paths to reach the dependent variable from the independent variable.

To me this is backwards. Once we have partials, we treat then as rates of change in the direction of the axes. We should then naturally ask ""what if the direction were not aligned with the axes?"". From there, a natural question of ""in which direction is the rate of change maximal?"" Seems to arise.  In the development of calculus, which came first? I find that by introducing the gradient before directional derivatives it seems like some arbitrary vector that was pulled out of no where.
