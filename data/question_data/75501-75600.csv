Searching for maximal topologies always gives results where extra conditions are added, such as being compact. I could not find any examples of the above choice. Perhaps there is an elementary reason it is uninteresting? Thanks in advance. Edit: since it seems that boring examples exist, is it possible to consider a topology as above which can only be obtained via ZL? I.e., analogous to a non principal ultrafilter... Thank you for the quick response. Further edit: I wonder then if there are any 'strange' examples of such topologies at all... But since I assumed Zorn held, this is a rather different question. I'll accept the current answer a few days if there are no more responses.",,['general-topology']

The (almost) same problem was posed here: Calculating Homology Groups of $S^1\times X$ , however there is no answer and it uses the additional assumption that the homology groups of X are free. I have the following questions: Can the assumption of freeness be left out? Can this be generalised to $S^n$ for larger n? Note that I have managed to solve the problem with the assumption of freeness, using Mayer-Vietoris: Set $A=X \times S^1 \setminus \{p\}$ and $B=X \times S^1 \setminus \{q\}$ for distinct points $p, q$ and $Y=X \times S^1$ . Then Mayer-Vietoris gives the following long exact sequence: $\cdots \rightarrow H_p(A\cap B) \rightarrow H_p(A)\oplus H_p(B)\rightarrow H_p(Y)\rightarrow H_{p-1}(A\cap B)\rightarrow \cdots$ Denote the homomorphisms $d,i_A\oplus i_B, j_A+j_B$ in this order. Here A and B are homotopy equivalent to X and the intersection is homotopy equivalent to two copies of X. We can use the long exact sequence above to create a short exact sequence: $0 \rightarrow ker(d) \rightarrow H_p(Y) \rightarrow Im(d) \rightarrow 0$ By exactness we have $Im(d)=ker(i_A\oplus i_B)$ and $ker(d)=Im(j_A+j_B)=(H_p(A)\oplus H_p(B))/ker(j_A+j_B)=(H_p(A)\oplus)H_p(B))/ker(i_A\oplus i_B)$ . So I only need to compute $i_A\oplus i_B$ . Given a cycle $c_p\in S_p(X)$ , take corresponding cycles $a_p, b_p$ in the two copies of X that form $A\cap B$ . Then $i_A\oplus i_B$ takes both $a_p, b_p$ to $(c_p, -c_p)$ in $H_p(A)\oplus H_p(B)$ . Thus $ker(i_A\oplus i_B)=\langle a_p-b_p \rangle$ and $Im(i_A\oplus i_B)=\langle (c_p,-c_p) \rangle$ .

So, if I know that $H_{p-1}(X)$ is free, the sequence automatically splits and we are done.

92,Can a Fréchet-Urysohn hemicompact Hausdorff space fail to be locally compact?,Can a Fréchet-Urysohn hemicompact Hausdorff space fail to be locally compact?,,"This recent question led to some discussion on hemicompactness.  A topological space $X$ is said to be hemicompact if there is an increasing sequence of compacta $K_1\subseteq\dots \subseteq K_n\subseteq \dots$ such that every compact $K\subseteq X$ lies in some $K_n$ . This is always the case when $X$ is $\sigma$ -compact and weakly locally compact (every point has a compact neighborhood), and the converse is true under the additional assumption of first countability (since a hemicompact space is trivially $\sigma$ -compact, the nontrivial part of the converse is the deduction of weak local compactness). On the other hand, here it was shown that we cannot relax the first countability assumption to sequentialness.  The counterexample is the Arens space , which is sequential (though not Fréchet-Urysohn ) and hemicompact, yet not weakly locally compact.  It should be noted that the Arens space has rather good separation properties ( $T_6$ ). A natural question becomes, given that sequentialness is too weak, can we relax first countability to the Fréchet-Urysohn property? The short answer is no, at least not without further assumptions.  I'll describe a counterexample next, then conclude with the titular question: Counterexample. Let $X=\mathbb R\cup \infty$ , where $\mathbb R$ has the Euclidean topology and neighborhoods of $\infty$ are those of the form $\{\infty\}\cup\mathbb R\backslash D$ , where $D\subset \mathbb R$ is discrete and closed (equivalently, $D$ has no limit points in $\mathbb R$ ). Lemma. $K\subseteq X$ is compact if and only if either $K\subseteq \mathbb R$ is Euclidean compact, or $\infty\in K$ and $K\cap \mathbb R$ is bounded. Proof. If $K\subseteq \mathbb R$ , then since $\mathbb R$ has the Euclidean topology $K$ is compact if and only if $K$ is Euclidean compact.  On the other hand, if $\infty\in K$ , and $K\cap \mathbb R\subseteq [-M,M]$ , then every open cover of $K$ has a member $U\ni \infty$ , whereby $\mathbb R\backslash U$ is closed and discrete, so that $K\backslash U\subseteq [-M,M]\backslash U$ is finite. Finally, if $K\cap \mathbb R$ is unbounded, then let $x_n\in K\cap \mathbb R$ be a sequence eventually leaving every bounded subset of $\mathbb R$ .  Then the sets $D_n=\{x_k\mid k\geq n\}$ are discrete and closed, and so the sets $U_n= \{\infty\}\cup\mathbb R\backslash D_n$ form an open cover of $K$ with no finite subcover. Corollary. $X$ is hemicompact, Fréchet-Urysohn, and not weakly locally compact. Proof. Every neighborhood of $\infty$ intersects $\mathbb R$ in an unbounded set, so there are no compact neighborhoods of $\infty$ , hence $X$ is not weakly locally compact.  On the other hand, the sets $K_n:=[-n,n]\cup\{\infty\}$ are an increasing sequence of compacta in $X$ , and every compact $K\subset X$ lies in some $K_n$ , so $X$ is hemicompact. Finally, to verify the Fréchet-Urysohn property, since every point in $\mathbb R$ has a countable basis, it suffices to consider $S\subseteq  \mathbb R$ with $\infty\in \overline{S}$ .  In this case, $S$ must have some limit point $x\in \mathbb R$ (otherwise $\{\infty\}\cup \mathbb R\backslash S$ is a neighborhood of $\infty$ ).  But then if $s_n\in S$ is a (distinct) sequence with $s_n\to x\in\mathbb R$ , then $s_n$ eventually leaves every closed discrete subset of $\mathbb R$ , whereby $s_n\to\infty$ as well. Question. Now, we could let the matter rest there, but compared to the Arens space, the space $X$ constructed above has rather poor separation properties:  it is $T_1$ , but just barely, in the sense that it is not even $US$ (convergent sequences do not have unique limits, as seen from the proof above). Is there a Hausdorff counterexample, i.e., is there a Fréchet-Urysohn hemicompact Hausdorff space that fails to be locally compact*?  More generally, if a space is hemicompact and Fréchet-Urysohn, might any separation axioms, anywhere from $US$ through to $T_6$ **, guarantee weak local compactness?

97,Dugundji: cofinite topology on countable infinite set is totally path-disconnected,Dugundji: cofinite topology on countable infinite set is totally path-disconnected,,"In James Dugundji's Topology (1966), chapter V, are the following problems: 1.3 Let $X$ be a[n infinite] countable set, with topology $\cal T = \{\emptyset\} \cup \{ A \space \vert \space {\complement}A$ is finite $\}$ . Show that $X$ is connected. 5.3 Let $X$ be the connected set in 1, Problem 3. Show that $X$ is totally pathwise disconnected. (By definition, $X$ is called totally pathwise disconnected if the only continuous maps $f: I \to X$ are the constant maps.) The first one is easy: in the cofinite topology, any two nonempty open sets meet, so there's no disconnection of $X$ . The second one was a challenge for me. A path in $X$ must be compact and connected, but all subsets of $X$ are compact and connected, so that doesn't help. Eventually I realized that a map $f: A \to X$ is continuous precisely when all fibers $f^{-1}(x)$ are closed. That led me to Proving a Sierpiński result on partitions of the unit interval into closed sets . So that's an answer, but it's hard for me to imagine many beginning topology students getting it. At this point in the text, we haven't even seen compactness, or identification maps, or separation axioms. Here's someone on Math Overflow who also found it not trivial: Why are the integers with the cofinite topology not path-connected? . Possibly there's a mistake in the text that makes this problem unusually hard? Certainly it has many small mistakes (you can see where I had to apply a correction above to Problem 1.3). Question. Is there any simpler approach to Problem V.5.3? I got interested in this question because of a resemblance to the pseudo-arc , which is another space with a homogeneous feel that's connected but totally path-disconnected. The pseudo-arc is Hausdorff, though, which makes it pretty different. So, a bonus question : are there other interesting examples of such spaces?","In James Dugundji's Topology (1966), chapter V, are the following problems: 1.3 Let be a[n infinite] countable set, with topology is finite .
