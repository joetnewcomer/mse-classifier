It's countable. The set $S$ of all finite subsets of $\mathbb N$ is $\bigcup_{k \in \mathbb N} U_k$ where $U_k$ is the set of subsets of size $k$ . If we prove $U_k$ is countable, we then know that $S$ is countable because the countable union of countable sets is itself countable. To show that $U_k$ is countable, note that we can view $U_k$ as ordered k-tuples $(u_{1},\cdots,u_{k})$ such that $u_i < u_{i+1}$ for $1 \leq i \leq k$ because every element in the subset must be distinct and thus must have a strict order. Also note that $\mathbb N^k = \underbrace{\mathbb N \times \cdots \times \mathbb N}_{\text{k copies}}$ is countable because the Cartesian product of a finite number of countable sets is countable. Since $U_k$ is a subset of $N^k$ , we know that $U_k$ is countable because the subset of a countable set is itself countable.

1,2n ambassador problem,2n ambassador problem,,"I found this problem, from the book Problem-Solving Strategies by Engel. And I found they have solved it in a very elegant(read: complex) way for me to comprehend. On the contrary, I came up with a different (read: easier) proof. But there might be loopholes in it. I am a newbie in discrete maths and I would be glad if someone could possibly point out a mistake in my proof. 2n ambassadors are invited to a banquet. Every ambassador has at most n−1 enemies. Prove that the ambassadors can be seated around a round table, so that nobody sits next to an enemy. Proof: Say we place all people around a round table in any arbitrary order. Say H is the total sum of all cases when we have a person sitting adjacent to his enemy. If H=0, we are done. Otherwise, Case 1: P is sitting adjacent to 2 enemies. Leaving P and his 2 enemies, we have at most n-3 enemies and at least n-1 friends. Placing the n-3 enemies, we have n-2 gaps between them, by pigeonhole principle, we see at least n-1 people in n-2 gaps, hence at least 1 gap should contain 2 friends thus we place P between them and H decreases. Case 2:  P is sitting adjacent to 1 enemy. Leaving P and his enemy and the friend beside him, we have at most n-2 enemies and at least n-2 friends. Placing the n-2 enemies, we have n-1 gaps between them, so at least one gap remains empty, we place P between 2 enemies then do according to case 1 and H decreases. So H $>=$ 0 always so we cannot keep on decreasing H forever, we have to reach a minimum, hence H=0 will be the minimum and then we will be done.","I found this problem, from the book Problem-Solving Strategies by Engel.

6,Simplified closed form for Fibonacci numbers and O(1) implementation,Simplified closed form for Fibonacci numbers and O(1) implementation,,"A friend of mine got the task to implement Fibonacci such that it will take less than 10 seconds for the 2000000th number. This was an interesting task so I set myself the task to make a super fast implementation for any $n$ . The trivial recursion algorithm will take too much time ( $O(F_n)$ operations), and using dynamic programming also won't work ( $O(n)$ operations). Here even the closed form solution might fail as it take $O(\log n)$ operations using fast exponentiation. Another problem is that $F_n$ becomes huge and operations become more and more expensive. To avoid these problems I decided to compute $\log(F_n)$ instead, The intuition is that $\log a^n = n\log a$ so we reduce the number of operations to 1. First let me present the math behind my code: $$a = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}, b = \frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2}, c=\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}, d=\frac{b}{a}$$ $$F_n = c(a^n - b^n) = ca^n(1-d^n)$$ I use tilde to denote numbers in the log domain (e.g $\tilde{a} = \log a)$ : $$\tilde{F}_n = \tilde{c} + n\tilde{a} + \log(1-d^n)$$ This almost solves the exponentiation problem, but we still have the $d^n$ , which can also be solved by: $$= \tilde{c} + n\tilde{a} + \log(1-(-1)^ne^{n\log (-d)})$$ This is not so clean as we could do the exact same thing in the $F_n$ formula, ideally I want to remove the $1-d^n$ completely - Note this does help numerically. Now for the more technical part, I implemented this exact algorithm to python using python (numpy): log_d = log(-(1 - sqrt(5))/(1 + sqrt(5))) sign = -1 if n % 2 else 1 return log(1 / sqrt(5)) + n*log((1 + sqrt(5)) / 2) + log(1 - sign * exp(n * log_d)) This code works well, with less than 0.0001 seconds for n=2 million, and I haven't found an instance where round(exp(log_fibonacci(n))) != fibonacci(n) . Something I noticed about my code is that round(exp(log_fibonacci(n))) != fibonacci(n) is 0 for $n>15$ is 0 because of numerical issues. This is actually very interesting, because it means my function computes $$\tilde{F}_n = \tilde{c} + n\tilde{a}$$ which consists of only 2 operations! This raised the following question: Is there a constant $N$ such that any $n>N$ satisfies $F_n=\text{round}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^n\right)$ ?

56,Equations and truth tables,Equations and truth tables,,"Let's say I work on the inequality $|x-1|>x-2$ in the following way: $$ |x-1|>x-2 ⇔ x-1≥0 \quad ∧ \quad |x-1|>x-2 \quad ∨ \quad x-1<0 \quad ∧ \quad |x-1|>x-2 \\ ⇔  x-1≥0 \quad ∧ \quad x-1>x-2 \quad ∨ \quad x-1<0 \quad ∧ \quad -(x-1)>x-2 \\ ⇔ x-1≥0 \quad ∧ \quad -1>-2 \quad ∨ \quad x-1<0 \quad ∧ \quad -(x-1)>x-2 $$ In $x-1≥0 ∧ -1>-2$ there is the true statement $-1>-2$ . So the truth value of the whole statment $$ x-1≥0 ∧ -1>-2  $$ only depends on $x-1≥0$ . If $x-1≥0$ is true, then the whole statment is true, if $x-1≥0$ is false then whole statment is false. So I should be able to write the following $$ x-1≥0 ∧ -1>-2 ⇔ x-1≥0  $$ I think that I can prove that I am allowed to write $$ x-1≥0 ∧ -1>-2 ⇔ x-1≥0  $$ with the help of a truth table in the following way: We know that the statement $B$ is true. With this knowledge we analyse the statement $$ A∧B⇔A  $$ with the help of a truth table: $A$ $B$ $A$ $∧$ $B$ $⇔$ $A$ 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 for ""true"", 0 for ""false"". The first two columns show all the possible truth values the statements A and B can have. As you can see in the truth table, the equivalence ⇔ has always the truth value of 1. This proves that if you have a statement B that is true, you can write $$ A∧B⇔A . $$ So coming back to the equations: this proves that I am allowed to write $$ x-1≥0 ∧ -1>-2 ⇔ x-1≥0 . $$ I also analysed this $$ A∨B⇔A  $$ statement in a similar way: We know that the statement B is false. With this knowledge we analyse the statement $$ A∨B⇔A  $$ with the help of a truth table: $A$ $B$ $A$ $∨$ $B$ $⇔$ $A$ 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 As you can see in the truth table, the equivalence ⇔ has always the truth value of 1. So first I want to know, up to this point, is everything correct? I have another question which is similar. Let's say I work on a set of equations and get to the following point: $$ \frac{20}{x} = \sqrt{(41-x^2 )}  ∧  y=\frac{20}{x} $$ Now, in a side-calculation, I work on the left equation by squaring it $$ \frac{20}{x} = \sqrt{(41-x^2 )} ⟹ \frac{400}{x^2} =41-x^2 $$ Now I use this Information in my set of equations, like this: $$ \frac{20}{x} = \sqrt{(41-x^2 )}  ∧  y=\frac{20}{x} ⟹ \frac{400}{x^2} =41-x^2  ∧  y=\frac{20}{x} $$ I want to  check if I actually can write the Implication-Arrow ""⟹"" there. I do this by using a truth table again, in the following way: We know that $$ A⇒C $$ is true (thats the squaring in the side-calculation). With this knowledge we analyse the statement $$ A ∧ B ⇒ C ∧ B $$ with the help of a truth table: $A$ $B$ $A$ $∧$ $B$ $⟹$ $C$ $∧$ $B$ 0 1 0 0 1 1 ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 I put the question marks there because if $A$ is false, we don't know what truth value $C$ has, even if $A⇒C$ is a tautology. All we know from the tautology $A⇒C$ is, that if $A$ is true, then $C$ is also true. The truth table proves that the statement $$ A ∧ B ⇒ C ∧ B  $$ with: $A⇒C$ is true is always true. That means it's correct to write an implication arrow here: $$ \frac{20}{x} = \sqrt{(41-x^2 )}  ∧  y=\frac{20}{x} ⟹ \frac{400}{x^2} =41-x^2  ∧  y=\frac{20}{x} $$ Again I have analysed the same stuff with the logical OR $∨$ : We know that $$ A⇒C $$ is true. With this knowledge we analyse the statement $$ A ∨ B ⇒ C ∨ B $$ with the help of a truth table: $A$ $B$ $A$ $∨$ $B$ $⟹$ $C$ $∨$ $B$ 0 1 0 1 1 1 ? 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 The truth table proves that the statement $$ A ∨ B ⇒ C ∨ B  $$ with: $A⇒C$ is true is always true. Are all these thoughts correct ? EDIT @ryang thank you for your answer. Yes I do know about the quantifier ∀x. Maybe I'll write the following to lay some groundwork, so that you also know where I stand with my knowledge: We can think of two predicates $$ A(x):(x=2 \Rightarrow  x^2=4) \ \ \ \  \mathrm{and} \ \ \ \ B(x):(x^2=4 \Rightarrow x=2 ) $$ There are real numbers that turn the predicate $A(x)$ into a true statement for eg. $A(3)$ is true, $A(2)$ is true, $A(-2)$ is true. There are real numbers that turn the predicate $B(x)$ into a true statement for eg. $B(3)$ is true, $B(2)$ is true. We can easily see that $B(-2)$ is false. Now it turns out that the statement $$ \forall x\in \mathbb R: A(x) $$ is a true statement and that the statement $$ \forall x\in \mathbb R: B(x) $$ is a false statement (just by looking at the truth value of $B(-2)$ ). The reason that we definitely know that $$ \forall x\in \mathbb R: A(x) $$ is a true statement is because we know that $$ t_1=t_2 \Rightarrow f(t_1)=f(t_2) $$ (with a function $f$ ) is a tautology, because that's just what functions do (input→output). So when we do our usual rearrangings of equations, we actually use functions on both sides of the equation. If the function $f$ is injective we can actually put the equivalence arrow $⇔$ there. The function used in the predicate $A(x)$ looks like this $$ f:t\mapsto t^2 $$ First I wanted to know, what do you think about the first two truth tables? Are they and the thoughts behind them  (how I set them up and how I used them to prove my point) correct? Regarding your first point, I meant it this way: We know that $$ A⇒C $$ is true/a tautology. With this knowledge we analyse the statement $$ A ∧ B ⇒ C ∧ B $$ with the help of a truth table. So I don't think that the truth table you posted is actually correct or maybe I should say, it doesn't represent what I am trying to do. Because the statement $$ A⇒C $$ should always have a truth value of 1 since it is a tautology. This should represent the step in the side-calculation where I squared the equation $$ \frac{20}{x} = \sqrt{(41-x^2 )}  ⟹ \frac{400}{x^2} =41-x^2. $$ I was trying to prove with a truth table that I can actually write the Implication-Arrow $⟹$ here $$ \frac{20}{x} = \sqrt{(41-x^2 )}  ∧  y=\frac{20}{x} ⟹ \frac{400}{x^2} =41-x^2  ∧  y=\frac{20}{x}. $$ That's why the third and fourth truth table look the way they do. Is it possible to set the truth tables up the way that I did to prove my point? Regarding your point: ""Furthermore, it is not generally valid to determine the truth of a predicate-logic formula by simply dropping its quantifiers and ignoring the internal structure of $Q(x)$ by pretending that it is just $Q$ ."" But are we not doing this actually pretty often? For example, let's say I work on the following set of equations $$ y=\frac{1}{6}x^2 \ \  \land \ \  x^2+y^2=16 $$ like this $$ y=\frac{1}{6}x^2 \ \  \land \ \  x^2+y^2=16 \iff 6y=x^2 \ \  \land \ \ x^2+y^2=16 \iff 6y=x^2 \ \  \land 6y+y^2=16 \\  \iff 6y=x^2 \ \  \land \ \ (y=2 \lor y=-8) \iff 6y=x^2 \ \land \ y=2 \ \ \lor \ \ 6y=x^2 \ \land \ y=-8    $$ The reason I knew that this step $$ 6y=x^2 \ \  \land \ \ (y=2 \lor y=-8) \iff 6y=x^2 \ \land \ y=2 \ \ \lor \ \ 6y=x^2 \ \land \ y=-8    $$ is valid, is because earlier I looked at the truth table of $$ A \ \land \ (B \lor C) \iff A \ \land \ B \ \ \lor \ \ A \ \land \ C.   $$ The truth table shows me that $$ A \ \land \ (B \lor C) \iff A \ \land \ B \ \ \lor \ \ A \ \land \ C.   $$ is a tautology, so that's why I used this when I worked on my sets of equations. I hope you see my point.","Let's say I work on the inequality in the following way: In there is the true statement . So the truth value of the whole statment only depends on .

58,Discrete-time dynamical systems with variable state space dimensions (or output space dimensions),Discrete-time dynamical systems with variable state space dimensions (or output space dimensions),,"I am trying to figure out how to formalize a dynamical system whose state vector can change dimensions from one step to the next. For example, I have a process (a discrete-time dynamical system, if you could call it) that at time step $t=k$ has a state vector $x(k)$ that is an $n$ -dimensional vector and at time $t=k+1$ , the state vector $x(k+1)$ can become an $(n+1)$ -dimensional vector depending on the input. In the context of dynamical systems, this is an unusual construct that I am not familiar with. Has anyone ran into this? Any clues as to how one might capture/describe the state space for a process like this? Addendum: An alternate form would be if the variable dimensional state, $x(k)$ , is re-defined to represent the output $y(k)$ of another system, one whose SS is a fixed dimensional vector space: $x(k+1)=F(k,x(k),u(k))$ , $x(0)=x_0 \in \mathbb{R^n}$ $y(k) = C(k,x(k),u(k))$ , $y(k) \in \mathbb{R}^{d_k}$ In the context of dynamical systems, it seems like this is a more natural construct to capture variability of the dimension: via the output space rather than the internal SS. This removes the challenges introduced with time incremental change in SS dimension, i.e. $x(k+1) \in \mathbb{R^{n}}$ has the same dimension as $x(k) \in \mathbb{R^{n}}$ , but now the output is free to change  dimension via an output transition mapping, $C$ , in $y(k)=C(k,x(k))$ or more generally $y(k)=C(k,x(k),u(k))$ where $u$ is the input to the system.

I have been at it for 4 hours, but I don't feel like the proof I produced is right. And since this is a simple question, I think I am missing some big point. I hope you guys can share some tips or feedback. Here's the solution I've come up with so far. I am sure there is a more elegant way. I was also thinking of maybe assuming n is odd and finding a contradiction or come to a false conslusion using P.M.I. (math induction). Let $n$ be a positive integer, then $n\geq1$. Suppose $3^n\equiv1 \pmod 8$. Then $8\mid 3^n-1$ and $3^n-1=8k$ for some integer $k$. Suppose $n$ is even, then $n=2v$ for some positive integer $v$. Then $$3^{2v}-1=8k=(3^2)^v-1=9^v-1,$$ which can be rewritten as $9^v-1=8k$. Now we need to prove that for every positive integer $v\geq 1$, $8\mid 9^v-1$ holds. Let $P(v)$ denote the statement $8|9^v-1$. We shall prove, by mathematical induction that $\forall v\geq1:P(v)$.  For $v=1$, $$P(1)\iff 8\mid9-1\iff 8\mid 8,$$ $8$ does indeed divide itself. Hence the basis premise $P(1)$ is true. Now we shall work with the second step of this proof, which is the induction premise. Let $v$ be an integer, $v\geq 1$ and suppose that $P(v)$ is true. That is, suppose that $9^v-1=8m$ for some integer $m$ (induction hypothesis). It must be shown that $P(v+1)$ is true, that is $9^{v+1}-1=8p$ ($*$) for some integer $p$. Let’s expand ($*$). $9^{v+1}-1 = 9^v9^1$. But, by substitution from the induction hypothesis we can rewrite it as: $$(8m+1)9^1-1=72m+9-1=72m+8=8(9m+1)=8p$$ Thus, $P(v+1)$ is true for all $v\geq 1$. Thus, from the basis step and the induction premise and with the help of P.M.I we can conclude that $P(v)$ is true for all $v\geq 1$. Therefore the congruence holds for all positive and even integers $n$. Thanks in advance.","I've had trouble trying to prove this statement.

Can anyone explain it? There are 50 baskets of apples. Each basket contains at least one, but no more than 24 apples. Show that there are at least 3 baskets containing the same number of apples. Solution: The baskets are the pigeons, and we place each of them in one of 24 pigeonholes according to how many apples are in it. Thus the ratio n/k of pigeons to pigeonholes is 50/24 = 2 and 1/12 By Generalized PHP there are at least this many baskets with the same number of apples, so there must be at least 3",,"['discrete-mathematics', 'pigeonhole-principle']"
97,finding ternary single-track Gray codes,finding ternary single-track Gray codes,,"A (binary) Gray code is a sequence of bit strings that run through all $2^n$ strings in $\{0,1\}^n$, and where successive strings differ by only one bit. Here's a $3$-bit Gray code, where the strings are written as columns: $00001111$ $00111100$ $01100110$ A single-track Gray code has the property that each row is identical up to offsets (i.e., cyclical shifts). It is impossible for such a code to run through all $2^n$ strings, so this condition is relaxed. Here's a $5$-bit single-track Gray code, with red zeroes showing the offsets: $\color{red}00000001110001111111$ $1111\color{red}0000000111000111$ $01111111\color{red}000000011100$ $110001111111\color{red}00000001$ $0001110001111111\color{red}0000$ Note that the above code is not maximal in the sense that it only runs through $20$ words, while it is possible for a $5$-bit single-track Gray code to run through up to $30$ words. But that's fine. Also note that the offsets are evenly spaced. That's not strictly necessary. Question: I am looking for ternary (or higher $k$-ary) single-track Gray codes for small values of $n$ (say $3 \leq n \leq 6$). In other words, the codes would run through (some of) the strings in $\{0,1,2\}^n$ without repeats, where successive strings differ in one place. The codes don't need to be maximal, and the offsets don't need to be evenly spaced. Any ideas?
