There are three types of toys: a small, a medium, and a large.  The medium is twice as long as the small and the large is thrice as long as the small.  I have a shelf that can accommodate exactly 10 small toys lengthwise.  How many different ways can this shelf be filled using different combinations of the toys (where order matters)? It is easy to solve for shorter shelves; for instance, for shelf length $3$, there are $4$ ways: small ($3x$); small, medium; medium, small; large.  For shelf length $4$, there are $7$ ways: small ($4x$); small ($2x$), medium; small, medium, small; medium, small ($2x$); medium ($2x$); small, large; large small.

1,Ways to arrange a word so that no vowel is isolated between two consonants,Ways to arrange a word so that no vowel is isolated between two consonants,,"Consider a seven-letter word formed by mixing up the letters in the word COMBINE. How many ways can you do this if no vowel is isolated between two consonants? (eg. EBMCION and MOIENCB are acceptable, but BEMCNIO is not) The final answer is given to be $1872$. We are being asked to find the numeric value of (Total number of seven-letter words) - (Number of words such that a vowel is isolated between two consonants). The word ""COMBINE"" has $4$ consonants and $3$ vowels. To compute the number of constructed words with an isolated vowel between two consonants,  I tried the following: 1st attempt: We may generalize the case, representing consonants as $1$s and vowels as $0$s. Now, we are finding the total number of seven-digit binary strings with four $1$s and three $0$s, containing the substring $101$.  There are $\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6$ strings that can be formed from the remaining two $0$s and $1$s. We may insert the substring $101$ into any position in these 6 strings. We have five available positions, because there are four digits. Therefore, there are $6 \times 5=30$ seven-digit binary strings with four $1$s and three $0$s, containing the substring $101$. Since each vowel and consonant is unique in the word COMBINE, there are $30 \times 4!\times3!=4320$ seven-letter words formed from COMBINE that contain an isolated vowel between two consonants, if we account for permutations of the vowels and consonants. However, $7!-4320=720 \neq 1872$, meaning my answer is incorrect. 2nd attempt: Since there are three vowels, for there to be an isolated vowel between two consonants, either all vowels are separated, or two vowels may be grouped up together while the remaining vowel is isolated (there is no other case). Case when all vowels are isolated: First, we arrange the consonants, Then, we choose three out of five possible places to place the vowels (.C.C.C.C., where C denotes a consonant and the periods represent possible places to put a vowel). We finally account for the arrangement of the vowels. $$ P(4,4) \times C(5,3) \times P(3,3) = 1440.$$ Case when one vowel is isolated, while the remaining two are a pair: First, we arrange the consonants. We then choose a vowel. Then, we choose a position out of three possible places to put it (C.C.C.C). Then, we choose a position out of four possible places to place the pair of the remaining vowels (.CVC.C.C. just as a possible example). Finally, we account for the arrangement of the vowels in the pair. $$ P(4,4) \times C(3,1) \times C(3,1) \times C(4,1) \times P(2,2) = 1728.$$ $7!-(1440+1728) = 1872$, which confirms that this is the correct answer.

The machine is weird, when you give it a quarter it gives you $1$ to $N$ candies (all numbers equally probable), this is called one ""buy"". You may assume you have more than $N$ quarters, so you can exhaust the machine completely.

You'll keep buying candies until the machine is empty, and you wish to maximize the expected number of candies you have at the end. The restriction here is that if you decide to keep a buy to yourself, you must give the next buy to your friend. So the obvious recurrence is as follows: $E[n] = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\max\{n-k+Z[k], E[k]\}$ $Z[n] = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}E[k]$ $E[n]$ represents the maximum expected number of candies if played optimally. $Z[n]$ represents the same thing if you have to skip a buy.

30,Can someone explain the ABC conjecture to me?,Can someone explain the ABC conjecture to me?,,"I am an undergrad and I know that the conjecture may have been proven recently. But in reading about it, I am entirely confused as to what it means and why it is important. I was hoping some of you kind people could help me. I know there are several formulations of the conjecture. Wolfram says: for any infinitesimal $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a constant $C_\epsilon$ such that for any three relatively prime integers $a$, $b$, $c$ satisfying $a+b=c$ the inequality $$\max (|a|, |b|, |c|) \leq C_{\epsilon}\displaystyle\prod_{p|abc} p^{1+\epsilon}$$ holds, where $p|abc$ indicates that the product is over primes $p$ which divide the product $abc$. Then Wikipedia says: For a positive integer $n$, the radical of $n$, denoted $\text{rad}(n)$, is the product of the distinct prime factors of $n$. If $a$, $b$, and $c$ are coprime positive integers such that $a + b = c$, it turns out that ""usually"" $c < \text{rad}(abc)$. The abc conjecture deals with the exceptions. Specifically, it states that for every $\epsilon>0$ there exist only finitely many triples $(a,b,c)$ of positive coprime integers with $a + b = c$ such that $$c>\text{rad}(abc)^{1+\epsilon}$$ An equivalent formulation states that for any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a constant $K$ such that, for all triples of coprime positive integers $(a, b, c)$ satisfying $a + b = c$, the inequality $$c<K\cdot\text{rad}(abc)^{1+\epsilon}$$ holds. A third formulation of the conjecture involves the quality $q(a, b, c)$ of the triple $(a, b, c)$, defined by: $$q(a,b,c)=\frac{\log(c)}{\log(\text{rad}(abc)}$$ I am particularly interested in the first definition, but any help with any of it would be greatly appreciated.","I am an undergrad and I know that the conjecture may have been proven recently.

So, my question is how I can find out how much I need the scale the z-positions of one of the directions, in order to get the two graphs to match as closely as possible.

In my Number Theory class this past semester, I worked on a project on Bertrand's Postulate (aka Chebyshev Theorem) and came across this paper towards the end, but didn't have time to go through it. I find it very fun (because it uses very neat objects called Newton polygons which I hadn't heard of before) so I've looked at it over break, and I'm guessing it would be pretty easy for most people here to understand (though I think it's advanced enough that I didn't put it under elementary-number-theory based on topics listed for that).  So I was wondering if anyone would be interested in discussing it with me?  There are some things in it which I don't quite understand, but I could also maybe explain some things to others here if any of you would like; and that would help me know whether I truly understand what I think I do. Anyways, the areas where I'm confused are as follows: On page 10, it says: ""It is easy to see that there is no loss of generality in restricting to $a_j = 1$ for $0 \le j \le m$.""  Am I correct in my thinking that, because $|a_0| = |a_m| = 1$ is a condition of the lemma rather than a conclusion of it, this sort of generalization is acceptable?  Which is also why it can later be stated that $b_j = m!/j!$, since it doesn't violate a restriction on $b_j$?  I hope that my question is clear. I'm a little fuzzy on the reasoning used in page 13 for why certain terms remain when deleting other terms.  Like when $k = 3$, is it true that we can conclude that either $x$ or $x-1$ must be $3$ because otherwise those three consecutive terms contain a prime factor larger than $3$ (a special case of Theorem 2 which obviously would've had to come from different reasoning)?  I think I'm missing something pretty obvious here, and I hope it doesn't have something to do with Bertrand's Postulate but I don't see how it would. On page 14 (under ""For this, we observe"") it states that $_xC_k$ equals the product of all $p^a$ for which $p \le k$.  I must be missing something here, because (for example) $_{22}C_{11}$ has 17 as a factor but $17 > 11$.  I'm accounting for the fact that $x \ge 2k$ and $k \ge 11$.  What else is there? On page 16, how are $17 \le k \le 29$ excluded by (2)?  Does that mean $_xC_k \ge _{4k}C_k$ fails to hold for all $x \ge 4k$ when $k$ is in that range?  And how would such verification be performed without testing all of those $x$, which is impossible. Finally, I wish either the proof of (b) or the proof of (c) would have been finished, as I'm thinking those are more similar than they are to the proof of (a).  I don't see how to finish (c) in a manner similar to (a), especially since I don't see another formula (besides the one at the end) relating $_xC_k$ to an expression in only $x$ the way it was related to an expression in only k for proving (a). If anyone could address any of these points, I would really appreciate it.
