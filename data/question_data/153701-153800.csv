Define the real number $N(f)$ by $$N(f) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2f(n)}.$$ $N(f)$ is well-defined because, for example, each summand is a positive number less than $\frac{1}{n^2}$ , so $N(f) \leq \frac{\pi^2}{6}$ , so we have a bounded above sequence of positive numbers. My question: is $N(f)$ ever rational? Note that if it is the case that $N(f)$ is never rational, we're almost certainly not going to be able to prove it in this thread. By taking $f(n)=n$ we obtain $\zeta(3)$ , which was only proven to be irrational in the 1970s, and apparently ""at least one of $\zeta(5), \zeta(7), \zeta(11),\zeta(13)$ must be irrational"" ( see link ), so I assume the irrationality of these numbers individually is unknown. But I'm wondering if I'm missing some $f$ for which it is not too hard show is a counterexample to the conjecture "" $N(f)$ is never rational.""

If we say $a_k, b_k$ are defined such that $$\frac{a_k}{b_k} = \sum_{n=1}^{k} \frac{1}{n^2f(n)}$$ is in lowest terms, then we know $$\frac{a_{k+1}}{b_{k+1}} = \frac{a_k}{b_k} + \frac{1}{(k+1)^2f(k+1)} = \frac{a_k (k+1)^2f(k+1) + b_k}{b_k (k+1)^2f(k+1)},$$ so in particular $da_{k+1} = a_k (k+1)^2f(k+1) + b_k$ , $db_{k+1} = b_k (k+1)^2f(k+1)$ , where $d$ is the gcd of the numerator and denominator.

14,Prime Numbers and a Two-Player Game,Prime Numbers and a Two-Player Game,,"In this question, $\mathbb{N}_0$ is the set of all nonnegative integers.  The notation $\mathbb{N}$ is reserved for the set of all positive integers. Alex and Beth are playing the following game.  Initially, there are $n\in\mathbb{N}_0$ marbles on a table.  Alex and Beth alternatively pick out some marbles out of the table, with Alex going first.  The number of removed marbles per turn must be a prime number (i.e., $2$ , $3$ , $5$ , $7$ , $11$ , etc.).  The first person who cannot make a move loses the game.  If $W$ is the set of all nonnegative integers such that Alex can always win if $n\in W$ , whereas $L$ is the set of all nonnegative integers such that Beth has a winning strategy if $n\in L$ . Is it true that $L$ is an infinite subset of $\mathbb{N}_0$ (clearly, $W$ is infinite, since it contains all the primes)? We now know that both $W$ and $L$ are infinite subsets of $\mathbb{N}_0$ .  What are natural densities of $W$ and $L$ ?  What are logarithmic densities of $W$ and $L$ ?  Does $L$ contain an infinite number of pairs of consecutive integers?  Does $L$ contain only finitely many even integers?  For a positive integer $k$ , does each of $W$ and $L$ always have infinitely many subsets of consecutive integers of size $k$ ?  Does $L$ contain an infinitely number of semiprimes?  Is the sum $\sum_{n\in L\setminus\{0\}}\,\frac{1}{n}$ finite (clearly, $\sum_{n\in W}\,\frac{1}{n}$ is infinite)? For a start, $W=\{2,3,4,5,6,7,8,11,12,13,14,15,\ldots\}$ and $L=\{0,1,9,10,25,34,35,\ldots\}$ .  I conjecture that $L$ is an infinite subset of $\mathbb{N}_0$ containing infinitely many semiprimes such that $\sum_{n\in L\setminus\{0\}}\,\frac{1}{n}$ is finite . Furthermore, I expect that the natural density and the logarithmic density of $W$ are both $1$ , whereas the natural density and the logarithmic density of $L$ are both $0$ . References are very welcome. According to the OEIS link given by Michael Lugo in a comment below, it seems that $\{0,1\}$ , $\{9,10\}$ , $\{34,35\}$ , and $\{309,310\}$ are the only subsets of $L$ consisting of consecutive integers (I could be wrong to assume that these are the only ones), and $W$ has at least three subsets of size $29$ which are composed by consecutive integers.  Also, this set of data suggests that the natural density and the logarithmic density of $L$ exist and are equal, with the value somewhere between $0.1$ and $0.2$ .  In addition, $\sum_{n\in L\setminus\{0\}}\,\frac{1}{n}>2.2$ , and of course, if the logarithmic density of $L$ exists and is positive, then this sum is infinite. An interesting remark by Michael ( $\neq$ Michael Lugo) is that the set $L$ contains very few even numbers.  Among the smallest $10000$ elements of $L$ , only $5$ of them are even.  This leads to my speculation that $L$ has only finitely many even numbers.  Michael also verifies that $L$ has a positive natural density of at least $0.1$ and at most $0.25$ , if $L$ has only $5$ even elements. If, instead, the number of removed marbles per turn must belong in nonempty set $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ such that $\mathbb{N}\setminus S$ is infinite, let $W_S$ and $L_S$ be the sets $W$ and $L$ , respectively, for this particular $S$ .  What can be said about the finiteness of $W_S$ and of $L_S$ ?  How about the finiteness of the reciprocal sums $\sum_{n\in W_S}\,\frac{1}{n}$ and $\sum_{n\in L_S\setminus\{0\}}\,\frac{1}{n}$ ?  What do we know about the natural and the logarithmic densities of $W_S$ and $L_S$ ? For example, if $S=\{1,2,\ldots,m\}$ for some $m\in\mathbb{N}$ , then we have $W_S=\big\{n\in\mathbb{N}_0\,\big|\,(m+1)\nmid n\big\}$ and $L_S=\big\{n\in\mathbb{N}_0\,\big|\,(m+1)\mid n\big\}$ .  Hence, $W_S$ and $L_S$ are infinite sets with $\sum_{n\in W_S}\,\frac{1}{n}$ and $\sum_{n \in L_S\setminus\{0\}}\frac{1}{n}$ being also infinite.

Note that the third theorem of Mertens says that the similar product $$ \prod_{p \le n}\left(1 - \frac{1}{p}\right) \sim \frac{e^{-\gamma}}{\log n} $$ where $\gamma \approx 0.577$ is Euler's constant .

What I've tried (Obviously not successfully, so it may be best to ignore everything that follows.) Taking logs, we can write  $$ \log f(n) = \sum_{2 < p \le n} \log\left(1 - \frac{1}{p-1}\right). \tag{1}\label{one} $$ We can try to relate this to the theorem of Mertens that  $$ \sum_{p \le x} \log\left(1 - \frac{1}{p}\right) = -\log\log x - \gamma + o(1) $$ or (peeling off the $p=2$ term) $$ \sum_{2 < p \le n} \log\left(1 - \frac{1}{p}\right) = -\log\log n - \gamma + \log 2 + o(1) \tag{2}\label{two} $$ To try to relate $\eqref{one}$ to $\eqref{two}$, we can write $\log\left(1 - \frac{1}{p-1}\right)$ in terms of $\log\left(1 - \frac{1}{p}\right)$: for $p>2$ we have $$ \begin{align} -\log\left(1 - \frac{1}{p-1}\right)  &= \frac{1}{p} + \frac{3}{2p^2} + \frac{7}{3p^3} + \frac{15}{4p^4} + \frac{31}{5p^5} + \frac{63}{6p^6} + \frac{127}{7p^7} + \dots \\ &= -\log\left(1 - \frac1p\right) + \left(\frac{2}{2p^2} + \frac{6}{3p^3} + \frac{14}{4p^4} + \frac{30}{5p^5} + \frac{62}{6p^6} + \cdots \right) \end{align} $$ where the second term is $\log\left(\frac{(p - 1)^2}{p(p-2)}\right)$. So, summing the above over $2 < p \le n$, $$ \begin{align} -\log f(n) &= -\sum_{2 < p \le n}\log\left(1 - \frac{1}{p-1}\right) \\ &= -\sum_{2 < p \le n}{\log\left(1 - \frac1p\right)} + \sum_{2 < p \le n}\left(\frac{2}{2p^2} + \frac{6}{3p^3} + \frac{14}{4p^4} + \frac{30}{5p^5} + \frac{62}{6p^6} + \cdots \right) \tag{3}\label{three}\\ &\approx \log\log n + \gamma - \log 2 + \frac{2}{2}\left(P(2)-\frac{1}{2^2}\right) + \frac{6}{3}\left(P(3)-\frac{1}{2^3}\right) + \frac{14}{4}\left(P(4)-\frac{1}{2^4}\right) + \dots \end{align} $$ where $P(k) = \sum_{p} \frac{1}{p^k}$ denotes the prime zeta function . On the face of it, this seems like it may give an expression of the form $-\log f(n) = \log\log n + c + o(1)$ for some constant $c$, and therefore $\log f(n) = -c - \log\log n + o(1)$ or  $$ f(n) \sim \frac{e^{-c}}{\log n} $$ which is what we wanted. The problem with this is that, in addition to the $\approx$ on the last line of $\eqref{three}$ being sloppy, it appears that in fact the subtracted term $\left(\frac{2}{2\cdot2^2} + \frac{6}{3\cdot2^3} + \frac{14}{4\cdot2^4} + \frac{30}{5\cdot2^5} + \frac{62}{6\cdot2^6} + \cdots \right)$ diverges! So it's not clear whether $\eqref{three}$ is meaningful in any way (and even if it were, whether this is a “proper” way to express the constant $c$).

55,Are differences between powers of 2 equal to differences between powers of 3 infinitely often?,Are differences between powers of 2 equal to differences between powers of 3 infinitely often?,,"Consider the equation $2^a-2^b=3^c-3^d$ where $a>b>0$ , $c>d>0$ , and $a,b,c,d$ are all integers. A computer search for solutions with $a,c\le20$ only finds 8-2=9-3, 32-8=27-3, and 256-16=243-3. I would really like there to be only finitely many solutions (even if these 3 aren't the only ones). I have noted that the lower powers on both sides can be factored out, but since all the exponents are arbitrary, I don't think I can use a pattern in modular residues to get the result. This feels vaguely reminiscent of Mihăilescu's theorem, but hopefully it's much easier to prove. Can someone point me towards a relevant reference or give me a nudge towards a method for solving it? Edit: I've read through Gottfried Helms's explanation, and come to some conclusions, but I'm afraid I'm a bit out of my depth, as I have little experience with Euler's totient theorem (and the related theorem of Carmichael), and no prior experience with Zsigmondy's theorem. I've worked on it a bit, and am presenting my thoughts/current understanding here, in the hopes that people can clarify things for me and bring me closer to a solution. Firstly, I noticed that there was no good reason to disallow $b=0$ or $d=0$ in the problem, so I started allowing them. Ideally, I would like to produce a complete list of the finitely many tuples (a computer suggests five) of nonnegative integers $\left(a,b,c,d\right)$ with $a>b\ge0,c>d\ge0$ where the above equation holds (note that if we allowed $a=b$ or $c=d$ , then we would have $a=b\Leftrightarrow c=d$ and that would be an infinite family of trivial solutions parametrized by $b$ and $d$ ). Throughout this discussion, I will follow Gottfried Helms in rewriting the equation as $$\frac{2^A-1}{3^d}=\frac{3^C-1}{2^b}\tag{1}$$ where $A=a-b,C=c-d>0$ , and both sides must be integers. Quick Observations: $2^{b}$ is the highest power of $2$ that divides $3^{C}-1$ , as otherwise the left hand side of (1) is odd and the right side is even. Thus, $b=0$ is impossible. Note that $3^2\equiv1\mod8$ , and $3-1\equiv2\mod8$ can't be divisible by $4$ . Therefore, $3^{C}-1$ is divisible either by $8$ or by $2$ and not $4$ . Hence, by 1., $b=2$ is impossible. If $A=1$ then $d=1$ or else the left side of (1) wouldn't be an integer. If $C=1$ , then $b\le1$ to make the right side of (1) an integer, so $C=1\Rightarrow b=1$ by 2. Zsigmondy's Theorem Zsigmondy's Theorem is a deep theorem I has not heard of before Gottfried's post, and it solves many simpler problems of a similar flavor to this one. An good collection of example applications can be found in this issue of the HKUST Mathematical Excalibur . Two relevant corollaries for us are: Each entry of the sequence $2^{n}-1$ has a new prime divisor the previous entries didn't except for $n=6$ . For example: $2^{2}-1$ has the new prime factor $3$ , which $2^{1}-1$ didn't have. $2^{3}-1$ has the new prime factor $7$ which the previous two didn't have. $2^{4}-1$ has the new prime factor $5$ , and $2^{5}-1$ has the new prime factor $31$ , but $2^{6}-1=3^{2}*7$ . Each entry of the sequence $3^{n}-1$ has a new prime divisor except for $n=2$ . $3^{2}-1$ = $\left(3^{1}-1\right)^{3}$ , but $3^{3}-1$ has $13$ , $3^{4}-1$ has $5$ , etc. More Special Cases: With Zsigmondy's theorem in hand, we can easily handle some more special cases. Case: $b=1$ and $d=0$ : In this case, the equation in the problem gives us $2^{a}-2=3^{c}-1$ , so that $2^{a}-1=3^{c}$ , but $2^{a}-1$ is getting new prime factors other than 3 by Zsigmondy unless $a=0,1,2$ . Since $a>b=1$ , only $a=2$ is allowed. This yields the solution “4-2=3-1 ”. Case: $C=1$ : By quick observation 5., $b=1$ , so we have $2^{A}-1=3^{d}$ , which forces $A\le2$ by Zsigmondy. $A=1$ would force $d=0$ and give us the solution from the previous case. If $A=2$ , then $d=1$ and we get “8-2=9-3”. (Note, Mihăilescu's theorem could have been used as extreme overkill for this since $2^{A}-1=3^{d}$ is equivalent to $2^{A}-3^{d}=1$ .) Better arguments? Gottfried seemed to be bringing up Carmichael's strengthening of Euler's totient theorem , but I don't understand how it's being used. The answer made it seem like they were saying something like $a^m\equiv 1\mod n$ for $a=3$ and $n$ coprime to $3$ exactly when $\lambda(n)\mid m$ , which is false. $3^3\equiv1\mod13$ , for instance. Carmichael's theorem may be very useful here, but I don't understand how to apply it. I also don't understand how exactly to use Zsigmondy's theorem repeatedly. I can verify Jack Daurizio's comment manually with modular arithmetic, but it seemed like they were using these theorems to quickly make claims about divisibility in a way I couldn't follow. Any elaboration/explanation on the methods of Gottfried's answer or a different step towards a solution would be much appreciated. Interesting Corollary As an aside, I forgot to mention the initial inspiration for this question. I was thinking about pairs of functions $f,g:\mathbb N\to\mathbb N$ such that $(n,m)\mapsto f(n)+g(m)$ is injective. One class of pairs I know is based on interleaving digits, but if the conjecture about powers of 2 and 3 is true, then $f(n)=2^{n+k}$ with $g(m)=3^{m+k}$ would work for some $k$ .","Consider the equation where , , and are all integers. A computer search for solutions with only finds 8-2=9-3, 32-8=27-3, and 256-16=243-3. I would really like there to be only finitely many solutions (even if these 3 aren't the only ones). I have noted that the lower powers on both sides can be factored out, but since all the exponents are arbitrary, I don't think I can use a pattern in modular residues to get the result. This feels vaguely reminiscent of Mihăilescu's theorem, but hopefully it's much easier to prove. Can someone point me towards a relevant reference or give me a nudge towards a method for solving it? Edit: I've read through Gottfried Helms's explanation, and come to some conclusions, but I'm afraid I'm a bit out of my depth, as I have little experience with Euler's totient theorem (and the related theorem of Carmichael), and no prior experience with Zsigmondy's theorem. I've worked on it a bit, and am presenting my thoughts/current understanding here, in the hopes that people can clarify things for me and bring me closer to a solution. Firstly, I noticed that there was no good reason to disallow or in the problem, so I started allowing them. Ideally, I would like to produce a complete list of the finitely many tuples (a computer suggests five) of nonnegative integers with where the above equation holds (note that if we allowed or , then we would have and that would be an infinite family of trivial solutions parametrized by and ). Throughout this discussion, I will follow Gottfried Helms in rewriting the equation as where , and both sides must be integers. Quick Observations: is the highest power of that divides , as otherwise the left hand side of (1) is odd and the right side is even. Thus, is impossible. Note that , and can't be divisible by . Therefore, is divisible either by or by and not . Hence, by 1., is impossible. If then or else the left side of (1) wouldn't be an integer. If , then to make the right side of (1) an integer, so by 2.

I recently read a comment on a video asking if anyone could prove that there are no positive integer solutions to the equation a 2 + b 2 + c 2 - abc = 1. It took me a while, but I found a proof, and I then used a similar method to prove a more general claim. For any given positive integer n , there exists a set of three positive integers a , b , and c satisfying the equation a 2 + b 2 + c 2 - abc = n if and only if there exists such a set where a 2 + b 2 ≤ n. For example, if there are no positive integer solutions to the equation a 2 + b 2 + c 2 - abc = 6 where a 2 + b 2 ≤ 6, then there are no positive integer solutions to that equation at all. My proof is too long to paste into this post, so here is a link to a PDF of it: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/9wsm5b4zsz9xpc0r7p0rk/naturalnumberproblem.pdf?rlkey=0gwqktvfu9215fskihlt2fvu3&dl=0 Since there are only finitely many pairs of positive integers who squares sum to a value less than or equal to a given number, you only need to check finitely many cases to determine whether there is a solution for a given n . For example, for n = 6, you only need to check {a = 1, b = 1} and {a = 1, b = 2}. Solving for c shows there are no positive integer solutions. After discovering this, I wrote a program to that checked whether there were solutions for each n from 1 to 100. I was hoping to find a pattern in the numbers that have or don't have solutions, but I didn't find much. However, I did notice that about half of the numbers had solutions. That intrigued me, so I increased the range of my search to see if this percentage held. Here are the results: From n = 100 to 999, the percentage of numbers with solutions stays between 49.3% and 52.5%. From n = 100 to 9999, the percentage of numbers with solutions stays between 49.8% and 50.4%. From n = 10000 to 99999, the percentage of numbers with solution stays between 50.1% and 50.7% My conjecture is that this percentage stays around 50% and that the deviations get smaller and smaller over time. I assume there is some way to state this more formally using limits. Does anyone know if what I found has already been discovered and if my conjecture has already proven or disproven? What methods would you even use to do this? As I said, I don't have much formal mathematical education. The math used in the proof linked above is fairly simple. Nothing more 'advanced' than modular arithmetic and proofs by contradiction. My intuition is that proving my conjecture would rely on math I've never even heard of, but maybe there is some (relatively) simple proof out there. I can prove that ~41.6% of all numbers will not have solutions. (I am speaking loosely. I know this needs to be stated more formally with limits.) This is because there are no solutions to the equation when n is congruent to 3 mod 4, 3 mod 9, or 6 mod 9. This was verified by a computer trying every possible solution working from mod 2 to mod 800. Let f(n) count the numbers less than or equal to n that are congruent to 3 mod 4, 3 mod 6, or 3 mod 9. There are no numbers that are congruent to both 3 mod 9 and 6 mod 9. The only numbers that are congruent to both 3 mod 4 and 3 mod 9 are those that are congruent to 3 mod 36, and the only one congruent to both 3 mod 4 and 6 mod 9 are those that congruent to 15 mod 36. Therefore, the limit of f(n)/n as n approaches infinity is equal to 1/4 + 1/9 + 1/9 - 1/36 - 1/36 = 5/12 = ~41.6% One more thing I know (proof in that PDF) is that for all n except n = 2 , there are either no positive integer solutions to the equation a 2 + b 2 + c 2 - abc = n or there are infinitely many such solutions. For n = 2, there is only one solution {a = b = c = 1}. I doubt that is relevant to the conjecture, but it does not hurt to mention it.

I could find no other examples. So I am looking to see if there are any more solutions to $ x^3+y^3=p.q.r$ , where $ x, y$ are positive integers and $ p<q<r$ are consecutive odd primes. Now $ x^3 + y^3 =LQ$ where $ L=x+y$ , and $ Q = L^2 -3xy$ . After playing with the problem for a while I thought maybe I should try and express the triple of factors in terms of the gaps between them. So $ g_1 = q-p$ , and $ g_2=r-q$ , and I was thinking what was the biggest possible factor that divided the resulting sum of cubes after choosing the gaps. Using elementary arguments I found that, $ L=q$ , or $ L=r$ , so dealing with the later case put $ L=r$ , and $ Q=pq= L^2 -3xy$ , eliminate $p$ , and $q$ , and put $ x = (L+d)/2$ , $ y=(L-d)/2$ for $d$ an odd positive integer. Giving $ L^2 - (g_1+2g_2)L+g_1(g_1+g_2)=L^2-3(L^2-d^2)/4$ . Completing the square and simplifying gives $ z^2-9d^2 = 4f$ , where $ z= 3L-2(g_1+2g_2)$ , and $ f = g_1^2+g_1g_2+g_2^2$ , the gaps are even so suitable factors can always be found, that is $a$ , $b$ , such that $4f= ab$ , and we get using the difference of squares $z= (a+b)/2$ , and so $L=\frac{z+2(g_1+2g_2)}{3}$ .

Then, a prime $p$ is expressible as a quadratic form (here, the norm of our quadratic field) with fundamental discriminant $\delta$ of class number $1 \iff (p/\delta)=1$.

By Dirichlet's theorem, the sum on the left contains $\frac{1}{2}$ of all primes, and should thus diverge, causing the entire sum to diverge.

I'm clueless to how to approach the general case when $\mathbb{Z}[\alpha]$ is not a UFD, and any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thus, the sum in question should look something like $$\sum_{(p/\delta)=1}\frac{1}{p}+\sum_{(q/\delta)=-1}\frac{1}{q^2},$$ where $p$ and $q$ range over all rational primes. By Dirichlet's theorem, the sum on the left contains $\frac{1}{2}$ of all primes, and should thus diverge, causing the entire sum to diverge. Note that this chain of reasoning holds only in the very specific case that $\mathbb{Z}[\alpha]$ is a UFD, since we can write things like $(\delta/p)=(p/\delta)$ by Quadratic reciprocity. I'm clueless to how to approach the general case when $\mathbb{Z}[\alpha]$ is not a UFD, and any help would be greatly appreciated. Perhaps since number fields are Dedekind we could look at the norms of prime ideals? I've scoured the internet but am unable to find any solution to this.

Update the question so it focuses on one problem only by editing this post . Closed 5 months ago . Improve this question The main motivation behind this is to see whether the 'magic' of q-analogs can be felt in number theory. Obviously for q-analogs to be applied to number theory the parametrization in $q$ must yield a generalization in some way whilst simultaneously keeping the structure in such a way that we are still studying numbers. For example: If in some equations involving q-numbers we are manipulating expressions and suddenly we get an additional ' $q^2$ term', as so $${[n]}_q + q^2= 1+q + 2q^2 ... + q^{n-1}$$ This becomes pretty meaningless in the context of number theory. It's good to wonder whether this is possible, studying a $q$ -analog of numbers, as by constructing some q-analog without it arrising naturally we are essentially just doing number theory with some unnecessary parameters. One way I thought to do this was as follows. Let ${[n]}_q$ denote the $q$ -number such that $${[n]}_q = \frac{1-q^n}{1-q}$$ such that $\lim_{q \rightarrow 1}{[n]}_q = n$ . We have the following rule for multiplication $${[nm]}_q = {[n]}_q{[m]}_{q^n}$$ Since we can write every number as a product of some primes and their powers $n = p_1^{k_1}p_2^{k_2}\ldots p_i^{k_i}$ we arrive at the following $q$ -analog expression $${[n]}_q = {[p_1^{k_1}]}_q{[p_2^{k_2}]}_{q^{p_1^{k_1}}}\ldots{[p_i^{k_i}]}_{q^{p_1^{k_1}p_2^{k_2}\ldots p_{i-1}^{k_{i-1}}}} \\ = \left(\prod_{j=0}^{k_1-1}{[p_1]}_{q^{p_1^j}}\right)\left(\prod_{j=0}^{k_2-1}{[p_2]}_{q^{p_2^jp_1^{k_1}}}\right)\ldots\left(\prod_{j=0}^{k_i-1}{[p_i]}_{q^{p_i^jp_1^{k_1}p_2^{k_2}\ldots p_{i-1}^{k_{i-1}}}}\right)$$ resulting in the fact that $${[n]}_q = \prod_i\left(\prod_{j=0}^{\nu_{p_i}(n)-1}{[p_i]}_{q^{p_i^j\prod_{r \leq i}p_r^{k_r}}}\right)$$ (Writing the $p$ -adic valuation $\nu_{p_i}(n)$ instead of $k$ ) Now we can turn to cyclotomic polynomials $$\Phi_n(x) = \prod_{\,\,\, 1 \leq k \leq n \\ \gcd(k,n) = 1} (x - e^{2\pi i \frac{k}{n}})$$ Note that since all $k \leq n$ (for some prime $n$ ) is coprime to $n$ if $n$ is prime we get $$\Phi_n(q) = {[n]}_q$$ (when $n$ is prime) Because of this we can write any $q$ -number as a product of cyclotomic polynomials. For example the obvious $${[n]}_q = \prod_{d \mid n}\frac{\Phi_d(q)}{\Phi_1(q)}$$ Perhaps more interestingly, using the formula we derived above we can see that $${[n]}_q = \prod_i\left(\prod_{j=0}^{\nu_{p_i}(n)-1}\Phi_{p_i}\left(q^{p_i^j\prod_{r \leq i}p_r^{k_r}}\right)\right)$$ Note that $$n = \lim_{q \rightarrow 1}\prod_i\left(\prod_{j=0}^{\nu_{p_i}(n)-1}\Phi_{p_i}\left(q^{p_i^j\prod_{r \leq i}p_r^{k_r}}\right)\right)$$ This form of product of cyclotomic polynomials has been studied by Borwein and Choi , who in their paper state that Any polynomial $P(x)$ with even degree $N-1$ and coefficients $\pm$ 1 is cyclotomic iff $$P(x) = \pm \Phi_{p_1}(\pm x)\Phi_{p_2}(\pm x^{p_1})...\Phi_{p_r}(\pm x^{p_1p_2...p_{r-1}})$$ Borwein and Choi's conjecture of the odd degree case is immediately obvious for all $\quad {[2k+1]}_q \quad \forall k \in \mathbb{N}$ by the connection presented above At first glance this seems to offer insight into number-theoretic statements through the roots of these equations, and hence Galois theory The twin-prime conjecture can be re-stated as asking whether there are infinitely many cases where $$1+q+q^2\Phi_p(q) = 0$$ for $q \in \{x: \Phi_{p+2}(x) = 0\}$ . This could allow for a different angle to approach the conjecture, from the perspective of varieties in algebric geometry. One could derive such a polynomial in $q$ for primes with any size gap. Although I'm not sure if this would lead to any progress toward the conjecture, I do think it could reveal some interesting structures. For simple number sums like $$\sum_{n=0}^{m}a_n$$ where $a_n \in \mathbb{Z}$ we have the following analog $$\sum_{n=0}^{m}{[a_n]}_qq^{\sum_{k < n}a_k}$$ This can also be considered in the case where $a_n \in \mathbb{Z}$ . Either way we are left with a sum with 'Fibonacci'-like properties $$a_0+a_1q^{a_0}+a_2q^{a_0+a_1}+a_3q^{a_0+a_1+a_2}...$$ This can be studied from the perspective of Lucas sequences If we consider the analog to a sum over the divisors of $n$ in terms of the ' $q$ -divisors' of $n$ (i.e the cyclotomic polynomials $\Phi_{d \mid n}(q)$ ) we get $$\left[n\sum_{d\mid n}\frac{f(d)}{d}\right]_q \rightarrow \left(\prod_{d\mid n}\frac{\Phi_d(q)}{\Phi_1(q)}\right) \sum_{d\mid n}\frac{f_q(d)}{\Phi_d(q)}$$ for example: $f\rightarrow (1-q)$ $$ = \Phi_{d_1}(q)\Phi_{d_2}(q)...\Phi_{d_{i-1}}(q)+...+\Phi_{d_2}(q)\Phi_{d_3}(q)...\Phi_{d_i}(q)$$ Another potentially interesting application is the study of $q$ -congruences on $q$ -numbers. One could look at some $${[n]}_q \equiv f(q) \quad \text{mod} \,\,\, \Phi_m(q)$$ $${[n]}_{q^k} \equiv \quad ... \quad \text{mod} \,\,\, {[m]}_q$$ This seems to already exist though. Here ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) are some papers that go over it. Although the concept seems to be studied with regards to hypergeometric series, instead of numbers, so this could also be very interesting These are the basic ideas. I would like to know if this parametrization and subsequent generalization of numbers in terms of cyclotomic polynomials is a viable analog to number-theory, or if there is another better analog. Relevant formulas, ideas, related papers, etc. are also appreciated. $q$ -analogs aren't widely used in (elementary) number theory, so this post (depending on the viability of 'number-theortic $q$ -analogs') can serve as a starting point.","Closed .
