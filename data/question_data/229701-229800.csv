Let $X$ be a partially ordered set with ordering relation $\leq$ , and let $x_0$ be an element of $X$ . Then there is a well-ordered subset $Y$ of $X$ which has $x_0$ as its minimal element, and which has no strict upper bound. My Understanding The following definitions are relevant: Let $X$ be a partially ordered set with ordering relation $\leq$ , and let $Y$ be a subset of X. If $x \in X$ , we say that $x$ is an upper bound for $Y$ iff $y \leq x$ for all $y \in Y$ . If in addition $x \notin Y$ then we say $x$ is a strict upper bound of $Y$ . Tao assumes to the contrary that the statement above is false. Then every well-ordered subset $Y$ of $X$ which has $x_0$ as its minimal element has at least one strict upper bound. Appealing to the Axiom of Choice we can assign to each such subset $Y$ a strict upper bound $s(Y) \in X$ . He then makes the following definition. A subset $Y$ of $X$ is said to be good set if $Y$ is well-ordered, contains $x_0$ as its minimal element and obeys the property that $x = s(\{y \in Y: y < x\})$ for each $x \in Y$ where $x \neq x_0$ . The lemma set as Exercise 8.5.13 and the one i'm trying to prove is If $Y$ and $Y'$ are two good subsets of $X$ , then every element of $Y'\setminus Y$ is a strict upper bound for $Y$ , and every element of $Y \setminus Y'$ is a strict upper bound for $Y'$ I got stuck for some time so I peeked at the hint in the textbook which was roughly show that $s(Y \cap Y ')$ exists and that $Y \cap Y'$ is good.

As such, I'm going to start posting a lot of my own personal solutions or questions onto the site for either proof validation or proof hints (if I'm unable to find the solution in other places), and I would greatly appreciate any feedback on my mathematical writing. Thank you. Exercise Show that the equation $$f(m, n) = 2^m(2n + 1) - 1$$ defines a one-to-one correspondence between $\omega \times \omega$ and $\omega$ . Proof First, we show that $f$ is injective. Consider $(m, n)$ and $(m', n')$ in $\omega \times \omega$ . Now suppose that $f(m, n) = f(m', n')$ . Then $2^{m}(2n+1) - 1 = 2^{m'}(2n' + 1) - 1$ and $2^{m}(2n+1) = 2^{m'}(2n' + 1)$ . Note that every value of this equation will only have one odd factor, mainly $(2n + 1)$ . As such, $n = n'$ and $2^m = 2^{m'}$ . So, $m = m'$ and $f$ is injective. Next, we wish to show that $f$ is surjective. Consider any $x \in \omega$ . If $x$ is even, take $m = 0$ and $n = x/2$ . If $x$ is odd, note that $x = 2k + 1$ for some $k \in \omega$ . So $2k = 2^m(2n + 1)$ if $m$ and $n$ exist, and since every even number contains a factor that is odd (for powers of two, we consider the factor one), there is always a $m$ and $n$ that satisfies the equality. Therefore, for any $x \in \omega$ , there is always a $m$ and $n$ such that $f(m, n) = 2^m(2n + 1) - 1$ and $f$ is surjective. As such, because $f$ is both surjective and injective, $f$ is bijective, and the equation $f(m, n) = 2^m(2n + 1) - 1$ defines a one-to-one correspondence between $\omega \times \omega$ and $\omega$ .","Synopsis In my studying of Set Theory, I've had the privilege of being able to compare much of my work to a solutions manual.

So $\bigcup_{n=k}^{\infty}A_n = \mathbb{N}$ and we have $$\bigcap_{k=0}^{\infty} \bigcup_{n=k}^{\infty}A_n = \left( A_0 \cup A_1 \cup \dots \right) \cap \left( A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \dots \right) \cap \left( A_2 \cup A_3 \cup \dots \right) \cap \dots = \mathbb{N} \cap \mathbb{N} \cap \mathbb{N} \cap \dots = \mathbb{N}$$ The notation is ambiguous - the $k$ in the definition of $A_n$ has nothing to do with the $k$ in the indexes of the unions and intersections.",,['elementary-set-theory']

This is sort of interesting, because it is the very first time I cannot see the structure of a proof presented in the book. The following are the theorem and Velleman's proof. Theorem: Suppose $R$ is a partial order on a set $A$, and $B \subseteq A$. If $R$ is a total order and $b$ is a minimal element of $B$, then $b$ is the smallest element of $B$. Velleman's Proof: Suppose $R$ is a total order and $b$ is a minimal element of $B$. Let $x$ be an arbitrary element of $B$. If $x = b$, then since $R$ is reflexive, $bRx$. Now suppose $x \neq b$. Since $R$ is a total order, we know that either $xRb$ or $bRx$. But $xRb$ can’t be true, since by combining $xRb$ with our assumption that $x \neq b$ we could conclude that $b$ is not minimal, thereby contradicting our assumption that it is minimal. Thus, $bRx$ must be true. Since $x$ was arbitrary, we can conclude that $ \forall x \in B(bRx)$, so $b$ is the smallest element of $B$. Problem My problem is with the structure of the proof. In particular, I see a bit as a ""rabbit out of the hat"" the fact that we start by assuming that $x \neq b$. In the pages of the book before the the actual proof, the author presents the scratch work behind the proof. Now, I can see the logic behind it (the all problem about the $x$ being or not being equal to $b$), but I do not see how this smoothly enters in the picture of the proof. Just consider that using ""Proof Designer"" (the software that can be found on Velleman's site and that goes along the book), I could actually prove the theorem without starting with the assumption that $x \neq b$. Indeed, the proof in words should go along the following lines: Proof: Assume that $B \subseteq A$, that $R$ is a total order, and that $b$ is a minimal element of $B$. Let $x \in B$ be arbitrary. Thus, by the fact that $b$ is minimal, we have that if $(x,b) \in R$, then $x=b$. Proceed by cases. 1. $(x,b) \notin R$: Since $x \in B$ and $b \in B$, we can conclude that $x \in A$ and $b \in A$. From the completeness of $R$ we have that either $(x,b) \in R$ or $(b,x) \in R$. Thus, by assumption that $(x,b) \notin R$, we have that  $(b,x) \in R$. 2. $x=b$: Since $x \in B$ and $b \in B$, we can conclude that $x \in A$ and $b \in A$.

Attempt Definition: A lattice, $L$, is a partially ordered set where given any two elements of $L$, $a$ and $b$, the set $\{ a,b \}$ has a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound. Denote a subset of $L$ by $S$. If $S$ has an upper bound, then $S$ has a least upper bound, or more precisely, given $u \in L$, $\forall s \in S$, $s \le u$ and given any upper bound, $v$, of $S$, $u \le v$. Suppose $S$ has a lower bound, $w$. Then $\forall s \in S$, $w \le s$. My question From here, I think I need to rely on the definition of a lattice.

Attempt Definition: A lattice, $L$, is a partially ordered set where given any two elements of $L$, $a$ and $b$, the set $\{ a,b \}$ has a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound. Denote a subset of $L$ by $S$. If $S$ has an upper bound, then $S$ has a least upper bound, or more precisely, given $u \in L$, $\forall s \in S$, $s \le u$ and given any upper bound, $v$, of $S$, $u \le v$. Suppose $S$ has a lower bound, $w$. Then $\forall s \in S$, $w \le s$. My question From here, I think I need to rely on the definition of a lattice.

73,"Why Zorn's Lemma ""fails"" on nested boxes problem?","Why Zorn's Lemma ""fails"" on nested boxes problem?",,"Backgound My problem comes from the nested boxes problem. Consider a list of boxes. Each box has a length, width, and height. Since the boxes can be rotated those terms are interchangeable. The boxes have rectangular surfaces and can be nested inside each other. A box can nest inside another box if all its dimensions are less than the corresponding dimensions of the other. You may only nest a box such that the corresponding surfaces are parallel to each other. A box may not be nested along the diagonal. You cannot also put two or more boxes side by side inside another box. Therefore, a box can be represented by a sorted (it's not hard to show that sorting the dimensions in ascending order won't affect the result of whether a box can be nested inside another) tuple of dimensions.  The set of boxes and the relation of being able to nested in another actually form a partially ordered set. And here comes my problem: Formalization Let's use an example. Let $S=\{(1,1,1),\,(3,4,4),\,(2,5,5)\}$. We define relation $\le$ to be $$ (x_1,y_1,z_1)\le(x_2,y_2,z_2) \text{ if and only if } x_1\le x_2,\,y_1\le y_2,\,\text{and }z_1\le z_2 $$ We see that $(S,\le)$ is a partially ordered set. Now, all the totally ordered subset of $S$ are: $$ S_1=\{(1,1,1),\,(3,4,4)\}\quad S_2=\{(1,1,1),(2,5,5)\} $$ where $(3,4,4)$ is the upper bound of $S_1$, $(2,5,5)$ is the upper bound of $S_2$. However, Zorn's Lemma says: Suppose a partially ordered set $P$ has the property that every chain (i.e. totally ordered subset) has an upper bound in $P$. Then the set $P$ contains at least one maximal element. Therefore, $S$ must have a maximal element. But it's obvious that $S$ doesn't have one. Did I miss something here?

My two concerns are: 1. is my attempted proof correct? and 2. Is HMP applicable even when we're dealing with collections instead of sets? This last point troubles me because after reading Asaf Karagila answer here I try to be more careful when talking about collections. Here is the corollary: Proposition: Suppose $X$ is a non-void set and $A$ is some non-void collection of subsets of $X$, and $S$ is a subcollection of $A$ which is monotonic. Then there exists a maximal monotonic subcollection of $A$ which contains $S$. I have included a proof outline because: 1. I still can't write proofs correctly so my reasoning in the final proof can appear wrong and 2. So that you can figure out where I got things wrong, if i did.

We can verify that for any two sets $S_i, S_j \in S$; $S_i \leq S_j$ or $S_j \leq S_i$, therefore $\leq$ is a linear ordering on $S$. By HMP, there exists a set $M$ such that it is maximal and $S \subset M$. And since $M \subset A$ and $A$ is monotonic, $M$ is monotonic as well. $\square$ If this proof is correct (or even if not) is there any other proof(s)? Enlightenment please!

There were similar posts regarding this problem to some extent, but none of them was exactly what I want to ask, and none of them solved my problem (They only showed the requirement of AC). This proposition is well known: Every infinite set has a countable subset. I have this proof for it: Let $X$ be an infinite set. Since it's not empty, we have a element $x_0 \in X$ . Now we define recursively $$\begin{align*}X_0 &:= X \\  \exists x_n &\in X_n \\ X_{n+1} &:= X_n\setminus\{x_n\}\end{align*}$$ And thus we have an infinite sequence $\{x_n\}$ , which gives a countable subset of $X$ . I understand why the AC is required, as we are selecting infinitely from sets of indistinguishable elements. However, I don't know how to apply it. In my understanding, we can only use AC when the entire collection of sets is known. In this problem, that requires us to know the entire $\{X_n\}$ . But as we can see, each definition of $X_n$ is built on the previous one. We may use finite choice and induction to show that for every $n$ , $\forall m \le n, X_n \text{ is well-defined}$ .

Suppose $g$ is a function which associates to each $A \in \mathcal{F}$ a set $g(A) \in \mathcal{F}$ such that $A \subset g(A)$ and $g(A) - A$ consists of at most one element. Then there exists an $A \in \mathcal{F}$ for which $g(A) = A$ . In the proof, it first defines a tower : Fix $A_0 \in \mathcal{F}$ . Call a subcollection $\mathcal{F}'$ of $\mathcal{F}$ a tower if $\mathcal{F}'$ has the following three properties: (a) $A_0 \in \mathcal{F}'$ (b) The union of every subchain of $\mathcal{F}'$ belongs to $\mathcal{F}'$ (c) If $A \in \mathcal{F}'$ , then also $g(A) \in \mathcal{F}'$ In the proof, we let $\mathcal{F}_0$ be the intersection of all towers which is also a tower (proof is trivial). Then we go on to define two more collection of sets: Let $\Gamma$ be the collection of all $C \in \mathcal{F}_0$ such that every $A \in \mathcal{F}_0$ satisfies either $A \subset C$ or $C \subset A$ . For each $C \in \Gamma$ , let $\Phi(C)$ be the collection of all $A \in \mathcal{F}_0$ such that either $A \subset C$ or $g(C) \subset A$ . In other words \begin{align*} \Gamma &= \{ C \in \mathcal{F}_0 : A \subset C \text{ or } C \subset A \; \text{ for every } A \in \mathcal{F}_0 \}\\ \Phi(C) &= \{ A \in \mathcal{F}_0: A \subset C \text{ or } g(C) \subset A \} \end{align*} Now in the proof, it proves that $\Phi(C)$ is a tower by showing that it meets all three properties shown above. The first two properties can be shown easily. For the third property, we do the following: If $A \in \Phi(C)$ there are three possibilities: Either $A \subset C$ and $A \neq C$ , or $A = C$ , or $g(C) \subset A$ . If $A$ is a proper subset of $C$ , then $C$ cannot be a proper subset of $g(A)$ , otherwise $g(A) - A$ would contain at least two elements; since $C \in \Gamma$ , it follows that $g(A) \subset C$ . If $A = C$ , then $g(A) = g(C)$ . If $g(C) \subset A$ , then also $g(C) \subset g(A)$ since $A \subset g(A)$ . Thus $g(A) \in \Phi(C)$ , and we have proved that $\Phi(C)$ is a tower. The minimality of $\mathcal{F}_0$ implies now that $\Phi(C) = \mathcal{F}_0$ , for every $C \in \Gamma$ I am stuck on the last claim in the proof where it says The minimality of $\mathcal{F}_0$ implies now that $\Phi(C) = \mathcal{F}_0$ , for every $C \in \Gamma$ . What exactly does the minimality mean in this context and how does that lead to the equality? My guess is that $\Phi(C)$ is the smallest tower containing $C$ , and since $\mathcal{F}_0$ is also the smallest tower containing $C$ , they must be equal? Also the proof says that In other words, if $A \in \mathcal{F}_0$ and $C \in \Gamma$ , then either $A \subset C$ or $g(C) \subset A$ . But this says that $g(C) \in \Gamma$ . Hence $\Gamma$ is a tower, and the minimality of $\mathcal{F}_0$ shows that $\Gamma = \mathcal{F}_0$ . It follows from the definition of $\Gamma$ that $\mathcal{F}_0$ is totally ordered. Here, since $\Phi(C) = \mathcal{F}_0$ , for any $A \in \mathcal{F}_0$ , either $A \subset C$ or $g(C) \subset A$ . Since $C \subset g(C)$ , we can say that for all $A \in \mathcal{F}_0$ , either $A \subset g(C)$ or $g(C) \subset A$ , which implies that $g(C) \in \Gamma$ . Hence this satisfies property (c) of the definition of tower. Here they again use the minimality condition to show that $\Gamma = \mathcal{F}_0$ which I'm not sure how they did.

Proof: Suppose $\bigcup (F \setminus G) \subseteq (\bigcup F) \setminus (\bigcup G)$ . Let $A \in (F \setminus G) $ and $B \in G$ be arbitrary. Now suppose $\exists x (x \in A \cap B)$ . Since $x \in A$ and $A \in (F \setminus G)$ , it follows by definition that $x \in \bigcup (F \setminus G)$ . Since $x \in \bigcup (F \setminus G)$ and $\bigcup (F \setminus G) \subseteq (\bigcup F) \setminus (\bigcup G)$ , $x \in (\bigcup F) \setminus (\bigcup G)$ . Thus, $x \in (\bigcup F) $ and $x \notin (\bigcup G) $ . But since $x \in B$ and $B \in G$ , $x \in \bigcup G$ . Thus, we have $x \in \bigcup G$ and $x \notin \bigcup G$ , which is a contradiction. So $\forall x (x \notin A \cap B)$ and $A \cap B = \emptyset$ . Since $A$ and $B$ were arbitrary, it follows that $\forall A \in (F \setminus G) \forall B \in G (A \cap B = \emptyset)$ . Suppose $\forall A \in (F \setminus G) \forall B \in G (A \cap B = \emptyset)$ . Let $x \in \bigcup (F \setminus G)$ be arbitrary. Since $x \in \bigcup (F \setminus G)$ , we can choose some $W \in (F \setminus G)$ such that $x \in W$ . Since $x \in W$ and $W \in F$ , it follows that $x \in \bigcup F$ by definition. Suppose $x \in \bigcup G$ . We can then choose a $V \in G$ such that $x \in V$ . But then we have $W \in (F \setminus G)$ , $V\in G$ , and $x \in W \cap V$ . This is a contradiction because it was given that $\forall A \in (F \setminus G) \forall B \in G (A \cap B = \emptyset)$ . Thus, $x \notin \bigcup G$ . Therefore, if $x \in \bigcup (F \setminus G)$ , then $x \in (\bigcup F) \setminus (\bigcup G)$ . Since $x$ was arbitrary, $\bigcup (F \setminus G) \subseteq (\bigcup F) \setminus (\bigcup G)$ . $\square$","This is an exercise from Velleman's ""How To Prove It"": Prove that iff . I am uncertain about the use of variables in existential instantiation. If I say something like , is it okay to then continue using in the rest of the proof, or should I introduce a new variable such that ? Also, when using contradiction, is it necessary to indicate that I am doing so? As I am self-studying, I would greatly appreciate other comments as well. Thanks in advance! Proof: Suppose . Let and be arbitrary. Now suppose . Since and , it follows by definition that . Since and , . Thus, and . But since and , . Thus, we have and , which is a contradiction. So and . Since and were arbitrary, it follows that . Suppose . Let be arbitrary. Since , we can choose some such that . Since and , it follows that by definition. Suppose . We can then choose a such that . But then we have , , and . This is a contradiction because it was given that . Thus, . Therefore, if , then . Since was arbitrary, .",\bigcup (F \setminus G) \subseteq (\bigcup F) \setminus (\bigcup G) \forall A \in (F \setminus G) \forall B \in G (A \cap B = \emptyset) \exists x P(x) x a P(a) \bigcup (F \setminus G) \subseteq (\bigcup F) \setminus (\bigcup G) A \in (F \setminus G)  B \in G \exists x (x \in A \cap B) x \in A A \in (F \setminus G) x \in \bigcup (F \setminus G) x \in \bigcup (F \setminus G) \bigcup (F \setminus G) \subseteq (\bigcup F) \setminus (\bigcup G) x \in (\bigcup F) \setminus (\bigcup G) x \in (\bigcup F)  x \notin (\bigcup G)  x \in B B \in G x \in \bigcup G x \in \bigcup G x \notin \bigcup G \forall x (x \notin A \cap B) A \cap B = \emptyset A B \forall A \in (F \setminus G) \forall B \in G (A \cap B = \emptyset) \forall A \in (F \setminus G) \forall B \in G (A \cap B = \emptyset) x \in \bigcup (F \setminus G) x \in \bigcup (F \setminus G) W \in (F \setminus G) x \in W x \in W W \in F x \in \bigcup F x \in \bigcup G V \in G x \in V W \in (F \setminus G) V\in G x \in W \cap V \forall A \in (F \setminus G) \forall B \in G (A \cap B = \emptyset) x \notin \bigcup G x \in \bigcup (F \setminus G) x \in (\bigcup F) \setminus (\bigcup G) x \bigcup (F \setminus G) \subseteq (\bigcup F) \setminus (\bigcup G) \square,"['elementary-set-theory', 'logic', 'proof-writing', 'solution-verification']"
