0,Duality of an Ample invertible sheaf has no non-trivial global section?,Duality of an Ample invertible sheaf has no non-trivial global section?,,"This is EXERCISE 7.1 of Chapter III in Hartshorne's AG: [Q] Let $X$ be an integral projective scheme of dimension $\geq1$ over a field $k$ , and let $\mathscr{L}$ be an ample invertible sheaf on $X$ . Then $H^0(X,\mathscr{L}^{-1})=0$ . Actually if $s\in H^0(X,\mathscr{L}^{-1})\neq0$ , as $H^0(X,\mathscr{L}^{-1})=\hom(\mathscr{O}_X,\mathscr{L}^{-1})$ , $s$ can be seen as a non-trivial map $s:\mathscr{O}_X\to\mathscr{L}^{-1}$ . As $X$ integral, this map need be injective, so we get an inclusion $s:\mathscr{L}^n\to\mathscr{O}_X$ for all $n>0$ . So induce an injection $\Gamma(X,\mathscr{L}^n)\to\Gamma(X,\mathscr{O}_X)$ ! Now as $\mathscr{L}$ be an ample invertible sheaf, $\dim_k(\Gamma(X,\mathscr{L}^n))$ should be very big and $\dim_k(\Gamma(X,\mathscr{O}_X))$ should be not so big. So we get the contradiction. (I) For $\Gamma(X,\mathscr{O}_X)$ : Here $k$ may not algebraic closed and $X$ may not geometrically reduced, so we can not get $\Gamma(X,\mathscr{O}_X)=k$ , in fact this can be very large! (see: https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0BUG ) We go through that proof, $t\in\Gamma(X,\mathscr{O}_X)=\hom(X,\mathbb{A}^1)$ . And we consider $X\to\mathbb{A}^1\to\mathbb{P}^1$ , use $X$ is proper, we can get that $X$ maps to a single closed point of $\mathbb{A}^1$ . So $\Gamma(X,\mathscr{O}_X)$ are all closed points in $\mathbb{A}^1$ ! (II) For $\Gamma(X,\mathscr{L}^n)$ : As $\mathscr{L}$ is ample, we may assume $\mathscr{L}^n$ generated by global sections and very ample which induce $i:X\to\mathbb{P}^N$ such that $\mathscr{L}^n=i^*\mathscr{O}(1)$ .

In the study of moduli of curves, one will sometimes see the following morphism referred to as the ""universal family"" or the ""universal genus $g$ curve"": $$\pi : M_{g,1} \to M_{g}.$$ Here $M_{g}$ is the coarse moduli space of smooth genus $g$ curves, and $M_{g,1}$ is the moduli space of smooth genus $g$ curves with one marked point. It's pretty clear intuitively why $\pi$ above would be a candidate for the universal family, but we know the moduli space of smooth curves is not fine! So equivalently, there is no universal family.

10,How to think about the canonical map $i^{-1}i_*\mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{F}$ and similar maps of sheaves defined by adjunction,How to think about the canonical map  and similar maps of sheaves defined by adjunction,i^{-1}i_*\mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{F},"Let $i \colon Z \to X$ be the inclusion of a closed subset $Z$ into $X.$ Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a sheaf on $Z.$ I would like to show that the canonical map $i^{-1}i_*\mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{F}$ is an isomorphism. (This is part of the proof of Stacks Project, Lemma 6.32.1 .) There are a few things that are not clear to me, so perhaps I will bold them as I go along. I understand that $$(i^{-1}i_*\mathcal{F})_z = (i_*\mathcal{F})_z = \mathcal{F}_z.$$ However, we know that just because two sheaves have isomorphic stalks does not necessarily mean that the two sheaves are isomorphic. We need to show that the above isomorphism on the stalks is induced by a morphism $i^{-1}i_*\mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{F}.$ Is there a reason why the isomorphism on stalks is induced by the canonical map $i^{-1}i_*\mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{F}?$ What even does the canonical map look like? So if I try to unpack the definitions, I get the following. Suppose $U$ is an open set of $X,$ and so $U \cap Z$ is an open set of $Z.$ Then $i^{-1}i_*\mathcal{F}(U \cap Z)$ is the sheaf associated to \begin{align*} U \cap Z &\mapsto \varinjlim_{V \supseteq U\cap Z}i_*\mathcal{F}(V)\\ &= \varinjlim_{V \supseteq U\cap Z} \mathcal{F}(i^{-1}(V))\\ &= \varinjlim_{V \supseteq U\cap Z} \mathcal{F}(V \cap Z). \end{align*} But the last limit is just taken over all the open sets of $Z$ that contains $U \cap Z,$ so does that mean that this is exactly $\mathcal{F}(U \cap Z)?$ Then by the universal proeprty of sheafification, does this directly show that $i^{-1}i_*\mathcal{F} = \mathcal{F}?$ Another way I tried to think about this is the following. We know that we have a bijection of sets $$\operatorname{Hom}(i^{-1}i_*\mathcal{F},\mathcal{F}) \cong \operatorname{Hom}(i_*\mathcal{F},i_*\mathcal{F}).$$ I would like to guess that our canonical map $\colon i^{-1}i_*\mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{F}$ is induced by the identity map $i_*\mathcal{F} \to i_*\mathcal{F}.$ But does this identification preserve the stalks?

This was my attempt to try and asnwer that. I know that we have the result that $$\operatorname{Hom}_{\textsf{Sch}}\left(\operatorname{Spec} A, \operatorname{Spec} (A \otimes_B A)\right) \cong \operatorname{Hom}_{\textsf{Ring}}(A \otimes_B A, A)$$ with the bijection given by $(g, g^\sharp) \mapsto g^\sharp_{\operatorname{Spec} A}$ so one possible way to show that the diagonal morphism does correspond to the claimed morphism of rings would be to show that ${\Delta_f}_{_{\operatorname{Spec} A}}^\sharp = \phi$ but I was unable to actually verify this. Another thing I was thinking of was the following. If I let $(p_1, p_1^\sharp) : \operatorname{Spec} (A \otimes_B A) \to \operatorname{Spec} A$ denote the projection map that comes with the fibered product, then we know that $p_1 \circ \Delta_f = 1_{\operatorname{Spec} A}$ the identity map on $\operatorname{Spec} A$ . Now I guess , (but I cannot show), that the morphism $(p_1, p_1^\sharp)$ corresponds to the morphism of rings $\iota : A \to A \otimes_B A$ given by $\iota(a) = a \otimes_B 1_A$ , because then we see that $\phi \circ \iota = 1_A$ the identity map on $A$ . If it were the case that the morphism $(p_1, p_1^\sharp)$ corresponds to $\iota$ , then since taking global sections is a contravariant functor (and really what that bijection above is) I would see that ${\Delta_f}_{_{\operatorname{Spec} A}}^\sharp\circ \iota = 1_A$ as well, but this isn't enough to prove that ${\Delta_f}_{_{\operatorname{Spec} A}}^\sharp = \phi$ .

The exercise asks us to consider the rational section $\frac{x^2}{x+y}$ of the sheaf $\mathcal{O}(1)$ on $\mathbb{P}_{k}^1$ and to compute the corresponding Weil divisor of poles and zeroes. I have a solution but it seems to go against what I think should be intuitively true so I was hoping someone could check it for me. First of all, it seems to me that intuitively the resulting Weil divisor should be $2[(x)] - [(x+y)]$ . However, let me explain my reasoning that led to a different result. To compute the divisor of a rational section of an invertible sheaf we first have to choose a trivialisation. The obvious choice here is to trivialise on the open subset $D_+(x+y)$ of $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ . This gives a trivialisation, $$ \Psi: \mathcal{O}(1)|_{D_{+}(x+y)} \stackrel{\times \frac{1}{x+y}}{\longrightarrow} \mathcal{O}|_{D_{+}(x+y)}. $$ On sections, we obtain a map on the ring of homogenous polynomials, $$ \Psi_{D_{+}(x+y)}: k \Big[ \frac{x}{x+y}, \frac{y}{x+y}    \Big] \cdot (x+y) \longrightarrow k \Big[\frac{x}{x+y} , \frac{y}{x+y}\Big]. $$ Then under this trivialisation, we obtain a section of the field of rational functions on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ . Namely we obtain the quotient of homogenous polynomials of the same degree, $$ \frac{x^2}{(x+y)^2}. $$ This then of course gives a Weil divisor of poles and zeroes of $2[(x)] - 2[(x+y)]$ . My confusion is that Ravi seems to say that you need to choose a trivialisation to compute this Weil divisor. But then of course a result of this is that ever single rational section of a line bundle on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ gives a Weil divisor of degree $0$ , since after choosing a trivialisation we will always have a quotient of homogenous polynomials of the same degree.

If $A$ is a ring, $f \in A$ , the principal opens are subsets of $Spec(A)$ , of the form $D(f):= Spec(A) \setminus V(f)$ .

For instance, are the points in U prime ideals of $Spec \Gamma(U,O_X)$ ?

Does the equation $$\dim_k H^0(X,\mathcal{O}_x(D)) = \deg D +1 -p_a(X)$$ hold for any Cartier divisor $D$ on $X$ with $\deg D \geq 2p_a(X)-1$? Thoughts: The desired equation holds in the case of a l.c.i. curve since then the dualizing sheaf is invertible and then we can work with the degree of $\omega_f \otimes \mathcal{O}_x(-D)$, i.e. for $\deg D$ large enough, $\omega_f \otimes \mathcal{O}_x(-D)$ has negative degree and thus no global sections. Maybe there is another way to show that this is the case if $\deg D$ increases. Another approach is to think about the first cohomology term $\dim_k H^1(X,\mathcal{O}_X(D))$ instead of $\dim_k H^0(X,\omega_f \otimes \mathcal{O}_x(-D))$ (i.e. avoid using the dualizing sheaf at all) and to show it vanishes for $\deg D$ large enough. One possible approach: Assume $\pi: C \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^1$ to be a proper integral morphism and let $\mathbb{P}^1 = U_0 \cup U_\infty$ be an open affine cover where $x$ is regular on $U_0$ and $1/x$ regular on $U_\infty$.

70,How to intersect the line at infinity?,How to intersect the line at infinity?,,"Question: Given: two points, $p=(a_1:b_2:1),q=(a_2:b_2:1)\in \mathbb{C}^2 \subset \mathbb{CP}^2$ and a cubic (i.e. elliptic) plane curve $\mathcal{C}$ (for example: $\{(x:y:z): x^3 - y^2z + z^3=0 \}$), such that $p,q \in \mathcal{C}$. What is a (or the) rigorous method to find the third point of the intersection of $\ell(p,q)$ (the unique line passing between $p$ and $q$) with $\mathcal{C}$ when this third point $r$ lies on the line at infinity? In other words, how can one rigorously find the formula for $r=\ell(p,q)\cap \mathcal{C}\setminus\{p,q\}$ when $r \in \{(x:y:0)\in \mathbb{CP}^2 \}$, the line at infinity? I know several ad hoc/intuitive/non-rigorous ways for finding $r$ which produce the correct answer. However, my usual rigorous method for finding $r$ breaks down when $r$ is in the line at infinity. Background/Context/Motivation: Let's say I have the points $P_2=(0:1:1)$ and $P_4=(0:-1:1)$ in the complex projective plane, which both lie on the cubic curve $\mathcal{C}=V(x^3 -y^2z +z^3)=\{(x:y:z)\in \mathbb{CP}^2 : x^3 - y^2z +z^3=0  \}$. (This is from exercises 2.3.5 and 2.3.6 in Algebraic Geometry: A Problem Solving Approach .) Now I don't know the equation for the line between $P_2$ and $P_4$ explicitly, but I can parametrize it as $\ell=\{ tP_2 + (1-t)P_4\in \mathbb{CP}^2 :t\in \mathbb{C}  \}$, which is is actually easier to work with ( usually ) because the parametrization makes it univariate instead of trivariate. Anyway, I know by Bezout's Theorem or the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, that $\ell$ and $\mathcal{C}$ must intersect at exactly three points (up to multiplicity). The problem is this: the univariate polynomial whose zeroes are supposed to be the three points of $\ell \cap \mathcal{C}$ is in this case quadratic (it is usually cubic as one would expect), and reduces to $t(t-1)=0$, i.e. not only is there one root too few, but the two roots which one does find are the two trivial roots which exist necessarily by the chosen parametrization for $\ell$ (i.e. when $t=0$, $P_4$, and when $t=1$, $P_2$). The whole point is to find the third point of $\ell \cap \mathcal{C}$ because this is the product of $P_2$ and $P_4$ under the chord-tangent composition law . For some reason this method does not work when the intersection of the parametrized line and the plane curve of interest lies on the line at infinity -- why does it not work in this case? For the record, what I am doing is substituting $\ell$ into the equation for $\mathcal{C}$, because (ostensibly) one should have that $$\{tP_2 + (1-t)P_4\in \mathbb{CP}^2 :t\in \mathbb{C} \} \cap \{ (x:y:z)\in \mathbb{CP}^2 : x^3 - y^2z +z^3=0  \} \\ = \{ (x:y:z) : \left[(x:y:z)=tP_2 + (1-t)P_4\text{ for some }t \in \mathbb{C}\right]\ \land\ \left[x^3 -y^2z + z^3 =0 \right]  \} \\ = \{ (0:2t-1:1) : (0)^3-(2t-1)^2(1) + (1)^3 =0  \} $$ However, this doesn't work, again because the polynomial in the last line is quadratic and not cubic. Now it is clear to me for several reasons that the third point of intersection of $\ell$ with $\mathcal{C}$ is $(0:1:0)$ Looking at the picture of the situation, it is self-evident that the third point of intersection cannot be in $\mathbb{C}^2$ and thus must lie on the line at infinity. Moreover, one can check that $(0:1:0)$ is the only point in $\mathcal{C}$ which is also in the line at infinity. The point in the line at infinity corresponding to $P_2=(0:1:1)$ is $(0:1:0)$ and the point in the line at infinity corresponding to $P_4=(0:-1:1)$ is $(0:-1:0)=(0:1:0)$. The line between $P_2$ and $P_4$ corresponds to the line $x=0$ in $\mathbb{C}^2$, which can only intersect the line at infinity at $(0:1:0)$. For points of $\ell$ such that $t\not=\frac{1}{2}$, one has that $(0:2t-1:1)=(0:1:\frac{1}{2t-1})$. Then $\underset{t \to \infty}{\lim} (0:1:\frac{1}{2t-1})=(0:1:0)$ and because intuitively lines in projective space ""wrap around and meet at infinity"" one should have that this limit is in $\ell$ and thus is our ""third root"".

76,Lines on a Quintic Threefold,Lines on a Quintic Threefold,,"We work over an algebraically closed field $k$. I've been given the exercise of showing (using only the technology introduced in the first chapter of Shafarevich's Basic Algebraic Geometry ) that every quintic threefold in $\mathbb{P}^4$ contains at least one line. Let $N = \nu_{5,5} - 1$. I've made an argument using the dimensions of the fibers of $\Gamma = \{(F,\ell) \in \mathbb{P}^N \times \text{Gr}(2,5)\mid \ell \subseteq V(F)\}$ over $\mathbb{P^N}$ and $\text{Gr}(2,5)$ which reduces the problem to finding a single quintic hypersurface which contains only finitely many lines, at which point I find I'm stuck. My thought process has been as follows: A similar argument reduces the problem of showing that every cubic surface in $\mathbb{P}^3$ contains a line to that of finding such a cubic surface which contains finitely many lines. At this point some case analysis shows that the surface given in affine coordinates $T_1T_2T_3 = 1$ can only contain lines at infinity, and that any such line is the intersection of a coordinate plane with the plane at infinity. This lower-dimensional example doesn't seem to generalize immediately, and all of the examples I've tried have either failed to be examples, or the case analysis in enumerating the lines on a particular surface has grown very unwieldy. Here are some attempts I've tried: Obvious reducible quintics like $x_0^5$ or $x_0x_1x_2x_3x_4$ don't work since they contain hyperplanes. $x_0^5 + x_1^5 + x_2^5 + x_3^5 + x_4^5$ contains infinitely many lines. I later found out this is known as the Fermat quintic threefold . $x_0^5 = (x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4)x_1x_2x_3x_4$ seems like it might work, but I don't know how to go about trying to prove that. This isn't an explicit example, but an idea for generating one that I don't know how to concretize.

I'm sure I must be missing something: is there a quintic threefold which can easily be shown to contain only finitely many lines?","We work over an algebraically closed field $k$. I've been given the exercise of showing (using only the technology introduced in the first chapter of Shafarevich's Basic Algebraic Geometry ) that every quintic threefold in $\mathbb{P}^4$ contains at least one line. Let $N = \nu_{5,5} - 1$. I've made an argument using the dimensions of the fibers of $\Gamma = \{(F,\ell) \in \mathbb{P}^N \times \text{Gr}(2,5)\mid \ell \subseteq V(F)\}$ over $\mathbb{P^N}$ and $\text{Gr}(2,5)$ which reduces the problem to finding a single quintic hypersurface which contains only finitely many lines, at which point I find I'm stuck. My thought process has been as follows: A similar argument reduces the problem of showing that every cubic surface in $\mathbb{P}^3$ contains a line to that of finding such a cubic surface which contains finitely many lines. At this point some case analysis shows that the surface given in affine coordinates $T_1T_2T_3 = 1$ can only contain lines at infinity, and that any such line is the intersection of a coordinate plane with the plane at infinity. This lower-dimensional example doesn't seem to generalize immediately, and all of the examples I've tried have either failed to be examples, or the case analysis in enumerating the lines on a particular surface has grown very unwieldy. Here are some attempts I've tried: Obvious reducible quintics like $x_0^5$ or $x_0x_1x_2x_3x_4$ don't work since they contain hyperplanes. $x_0^5 + x_1^5 + x_2^5 + x_3^5 + x_4^5$ contains infinitely many lines. I later found out this is known as the Fermat quintic threefold . $x_0^5 = (x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4)x_1x_2x_3x_4$ seems like it might work, but I don't know how to go about trying to prove that.

If we choose $R=k[x_1,x_2,\ldots]$ do we still get a ""reasonable"" picture of the geometry of $X$, or is the non-noetherian case always somewhat more abstract than the ""classical"" picture of algebraic sets in finite affine space? From what I was reading, any open cover of $X$ has a finite subcover ($\text {Spec} R$ is quasi-compact). Does this still hold if $R$ is not noetherian?

94,Taking module sheaf commutes with tensor product,Taking module sheaf commutes with tensor product,,"I'm trying to prove proposition II.5.2.b in Algebraic Geometry by Hartshorne. The proposition states that for $ A $-modules $ M $ and $ N $ and $X=\text{Spec}\ A$ there is an isomorphism $ (M\otimes_{A}N)^\tilde{}\cong \tilde{M}\otimes_{\mathcal{O}_{X}}\tilde{N} $. I think I have a proof using category theory. I defined a ""bilinear"" morphism of sheaves and showed that both sheaves satisfy a universal property similar to that of the tensor product of modules. I'm curious as to whether this is a common proof. The proof in the book is very brief. It says this follows since localisation commutes with tensor products. I'm also interested in a more constructive proof. Vakil's notes contain a hint saying we can define an isomorphism on distinguished open subsets and on such subsets no need for sheafification. This is page 372. The book by Wedhorn and Görtz appears to follow the same approach but it's missing details. This is page 185. Can someone help me fill in the details of such a proof?","I'm trying to prove proposition II.5.2.b in Algebraic Geometry by Hartshorne.

Which rational functions $\mathbb{P}^1\rightarrow k$ are regular at the point at infinity? What order of zero do they have there?"" Here's my attempt so far: Let $u$ be a rational function on $\mathbb{P}^1$ that is regular at the point at infinity $\mathcal{O}:=[1:0]$. I have already proved in another exercise that if $u$ is regular on all of $\mathbb{P}^1$ then it is constant; hence let $u=p/q$ where $p$ and $q$ are homogeneous polynomials in $k[X,Y]$ of the same degree $n\geq 1$, say $p = \sum_{i+j = n} a_{i j} X^i Y^j$ and $q = \sum_{i+j = n} b_{i j} X^i Y^j$. Then since $u$ is regular at $\mathcal{O}$, $q(\mathcal{O}) = b_{n0} \neq 0$ and we see $u(\mathcal{O}) = a_{n 0}/b_{n 0}\in k$. From the question it looks like we ought to be able to show $a_{n 0} = 0$, but I don't really know how to proceed from here. One idea I had was to suppose $a_{n 0}\neq 0$ and look at what happens to $u$ on the affine part $\mathbb{A}_y^1 :=\left\{[a:b]\in\mathbb{P}^1 : b\neq 0\right\}$, but I can't seem to get anywhere with this.
