I take the following from A First Course in Abstract Algebra by Fraleigh. The first is as follows: FTFGAG 1: Every finitely generated abelian group $G$ is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups in the form $$ G \cong \mathbb{Z}_{p_1^{r_1}} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}_{p_n^{r_n}} \times \mathbb{Z} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}$$ where $p_i$ are primes (not necessarily distinct) and $r_i$ are positive integers. But then we also have the second version: FTFGAG 2: Every finitely generated abelian group $G$ is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups in the form $$ G \cong \mathbb{Z}_{m_1} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}_{m_r} \times \mathbb{Z} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}$$ where $m_1 | m_2 | \cdots | m_r$. My question is whether these two hold at all times?

I've also seen statements of the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) which say that $\mathbb{Z}_{nm} \cong \mathbb{Z}_n \times \mathbb{Z}_m$ if and only if $\gcd(n,m)=1$. Does this not contradict $\mathbb{Z}_{20} \cong \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_{10}$ from above?

Here are the things I do know: $H$ has an order that divides $(p-1)!$ since it has index $p$ in $G$, and $G$ has order $pu$ for some $u$ not divisible by $p$. Everything up to and excluding the part where I am asked to prove that $H \cap G^{(n-1)} = 1$. I know how to prove the next part where I'm asked to prove that $|G^{(n-1)}| = p$ provided I know how to do that previous part! I know that $\lvert S_p \rvert = p!$, so any Sylow $p$-subgroup of $S_p$ has size $p^1 = p$, since no other factors of $p!$ can contain $p$ as a prime factor. Now here are the things I do not know: I am terribly stuck at the step where I have to show $H \cap G^{(n-1)} = 1$. I tried showing that this is normal, so I can use the result immediately preceding to conclude that it is trivial. But I'm having major problems. I may just be missing something extremely obvious. Even if I can do that part, the next part asks us to conclude that this Sylow $p$-subgroup is normal in $G$, which I can't immediately see how to derive. I'm assuming ``this Sylow $p$-subgroup'' is referring to the size $p$ subgroup $G^{(n-1)}$---it has the right size to be a Sylow $p$-subgroup.",,"['abstract-algebra', 'group-theory', 'galois-theory']"

The question, however, derives from a Dummit and Foote exercise (section 4.2 exercise 10 page 122) and the answers provided make use of material that appears later in the book, or, at least, I do not clearly understand them in terms of the material that I have studied already. So, I would like to submit the following tentative proof 'from first principles' (i.e. Dummit and Foote before page 122). As I feel insecure about it, I would be grateful if you could check it. Consider a nonabelian group G of order 6. By Cauchy's theorem, the group contains at least one element of order 2, and therefore at least one subgroup of order 2. Suppose this/these subgroups are all normal. This would imply that all elements of order 2 commute with all elements of G. The remaining elements of group G are of order 1 (which trivially is in the center of G), or order 3 (order 6 would imply the group is cyclic and therefore abelian). Since all elements of order 2 are in the center, the order 3 elements will commute with them. The following reasoning shows that they also commute with each other. Let $x≠y, |x|=|y|=3$ . $\langle x\rangle$ and $\langle y\rangle$ are normal in $G$ because their index is $2$ . Now $x\{1, y, y^2\}=\{1, y, y^2\}x$ implies, in the nonabelian case, that $x.y=y^2.x$ and $x.y^2=y.x$ . Likewise, $y\langle x\rangle=\langle x\rangle y$ implies $y.x=x^2.y$ and $y.x^2=x.y$ . Manipulating these equations shows $y.x = x.y$ , so the nonabelian case is impossible. Hence, order 3 elements are in the center of G as well.

It is enough to show that the number $\cos\theta$ is constructible, and WolframAlpha gave  $\cos\theta=\frac18 (1-\sqrt5)-\frac14 \sqrt{{\frac32} (5+\sqrt5)}$. I think after that it is immediate because we first add $\sqrt5$ to $\mathbb{Q}$ and then add $\sqrt{{\frac32} (5+\sqrt5)}$, so both extensions are of degree $2$.
