5,Fundamental group of a space under a group action,Fundamental group of a space under a group action,,"The short version: Why does a Borcea-Voisin threefold has trivial fundamental group? Well, what is a Borcea-Voisin threefold? These are named after Borcea and Voisin, who introduced a method of constructing Calabi-Yau threefolds from elliptic curves (CY-onefolds) and K3 surfaces (CY-twofolds), and going through Voisin's proof that these threefolds are indeed Calabi-Yau, I'm stuck on why the fundamental group is trivial. In detail, let $E$ be an elliptic curve with canonical involution $(x,y)\mapsto (x,-y)$ (we're working in characteristic $0$). Let $S$ be a K3 surface with (non-symplectic) involution $\sigma$ acting by $-1$ on $H^{2,0}(S)$. Then the (crepant) resolution of $E\times S/\iota\times\sigma$ is a Calabi-Yau threefold. Denote the resolution by $X$. To see this, there are a few things to show (though I'm happy with showing the necessary Hodge numbers are zero, once $\pi_1(X)$ is trivial). Firstly, we can write the resolution $X$ as $\widetilde{E\times S}/\widetilde{\iota\times\sigma}$, where we blowup the fixed locus of $\iota\times\sigma$ on $E\times S$, then extend the action of $\iota\times\sigma$. The fixed locus of an elliptic curve under the involution is four isolated points (topological Lefschetz trace) and the fixed locus of $S$ under $\sigma$ is the union of (say) $N$ disjoint curves (holomorphic and topological Lefschetz trace). Thus, the fixed locus of $E\times S$ is the union of each $P_i\times C_j$, where each $P_i$ is an isolated (fixed) point on $E$ and $C_j$ is a (fixed) curve on $S$. If there is at least one fixed curve $C$ on $S$, there is at least one fixed point on $E\times S$, say $P$, and $\widetilde{\iota\times\sigma}$ acts on the fundamental group $\pi_1(\widetilde{E\times S},P)$ by $-1$, as $$ \pi_1(\widetilde{E\times S},P) \simeq \pi_1(E\times S,P) \simeq \pi_1(E)\times\pi_1(S) \simeq \pi_1(E), $$ and the action of $\iota$ on $E$ passes through to $\pi_1(E)$. Voisin now claims this implies $\pi_1(X)$ is trivial, and I'm guessing it shouldn't be too difficult to justify, given there are no details, but I'm not too sure how this is done. I've also asked a few people that know far more about the fundamental group than I do, and no one had a solution (though they all say it's probably simple...) I'd love to just say $$ \pi_1(X/G) \simeq \pi_1(X)^G, $$ for any $X$ with action by $G$, but this isn't always true... Is there something horribly simple I've missed for this case?

Specifically, in his answer, Ryan Reich claims that for a sheaf $F$ on $X$, the stalk $F_x$ is the colimit over opens $U$ containing $x$ of the sheaves $j_* j^* F$, where $j: U \rightarrow X$ is the inclusion map. Every time I try to show that the skyscraper sheaf satisfies the universal property I end up in a seeming dead end.

99,(Continued:) finiteness of étale morphisms,(Continued:) finiteness of étale morphisms,,"I was writing a question, it became too long, and i decided to split it into two parts. I hope posting two questions at the same time is not a problem. First question: Checking flat- and smoothness: enough to check on closed points? Now let $f: X \rightarrow Y$ be a morphism of varieties. If $f$ is smooth of relative dimension 0, i.e. étale, its preimage of a point should be a 0-dimensional regular scheme, i.e. a collection of points. But a zero dimensional union of varieties (i.e. a zero-dimensional scheme that is a variety except that integral is replaced by reduced) always has a finite set as space, right? So Am i correct to say that fibers of étale morphisms are always finite, i.e. étale implies quasi-finite? Moreover, i understood that étale morphisms are not always finite, so to finish the picture could you give an example of a non-finite étale morphism? Thanks a lot!
