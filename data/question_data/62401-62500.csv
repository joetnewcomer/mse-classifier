2,Combinatorics: Guarantee getting 10 out of 13 right as efficiently as possible (Stryktipset),Combinatorics: Guarantee getting 10 out of 13 right as efficiently as possible (Stryktipset),,"First, a little background ""Stryktipset"" is a popular form of football (soccer) gambling in Sweden, but I'm sure similar games exist in many other countries. The concept is simple: out of a list of thirteen games, the player needs to pick the correct winner, or whether the game ends in a draw. The notation for this is 1 for home team win, X for a draw, and 2 for an away win. The player competes against the player pool, where set percentages of the total prize pool gets divided among those who get 10, 11, 12 and 13 corretly picked games. A common way to play is through ""guarantees"" and ""semi-guarantees"", meaning that for every game, the player can choose to play all three alternatives, or at least two of them. So for instance, playing game 1 as 1X2, game 2 as X2 and the rest as ""single choice"", yields 3*2*(1^11) combinations, for 6 ways to get all 13 right, or 6 ""rows"", and thus a cost of 6 times the base cost. This is called an M, or Mathematical, system, whereas just picking one option per game is a ""single"". To the point Now, a common puzzle is ""what is the lowest amount of rows that guarantees the player 5 correct games?"" Many responders go by their gut feel of ""guaranteeing"" five games and then letting the remaining 8 be arbitrary, for 5^3 = 243 rows. But, if one plays just three singles that don't overlap, this turns out to be enough to guarantee at least 5 correct games. This can easily be seen by imagining one single with all 1's, one with all X's and one with all 2's. Naturally, at least one of the signs needs to show up at least five times.

Find a bijective mapping $f: \{0,...,n-1\}\rightarrow \{1,...,n\}$ that minimizes \begin{align*} \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}r_{f(k)}^{k} \end{align*} Solution : Let $f$ be a mapping that satisfies $k< j \, \rightarrow \, r_{f(k)} \ge r_{f(j)}$. In other words, $f$ sorts $S$ in non-increasing order. To prove optimality, consider a bijective mapping $g$ defined on the same domain and range, and suppose $g$ minimizes the sum. Further, suppose $g$ differs from $f$. Therefore, there must be some inversion: an index $i$ such that $r_{g(i)} < r_{g(i+1)}$. We will show that swapping these two images decreases the total sum, contradicting the optimality of $g$. Notice that if we only swap these two, then the remaining terms of the sum are unchanged. To show that the swap decreases the total sum, we must verify \begin{align*} r_{g(i+1)}^{i}+r_{g(i)}^{i+1} &< r_{g(i)}^{i}+r_{g(i+1)}^{i+1}\\ r_{g(i)}^{i+1} -r_{g(i)}^{i}&< r_{g(i+1)}^{i+1}-r_{g(i+1)}^{i}&\iff \\ r_{g(i)}^i(r_{g(i)} - 1)&<r_{g(i+1)}^i(r_{g(i+1)}-1)&\iff  \end{align*} But this final inequality holds because each rate exceeds one and by assumption $r_{g(i)} < r_{g(i+1)}$. This contradicts the optimality of $g$, hence any mapping that deviates from sorting the rates in descending order is not optimal.

The function I'll define is a generalization of the function given in that problem. Fix some $n$ . Then define the function $f_n : \mathbb{N}^n \to \mathbb{N}^n$ on $n$ -tuples of natural numbers as follows: The first element of $f_n(\bf{x})$ is the number of distinct values appearing in the tuple $\bf{x}$ . For $j > 1$ , the $j$ th element of the tuple $f_n(\bf{x})$ is the number of times $j-2$ appears in $\bf{x}$ . So, the second element of the tuple $f_n(\bf{x})$ is the number of zeroes in $\bf{x}$ , the third element is the number of ones, and so on. As an example of computing this function, consider $$f_5(2, 3, 2, 0, 0) = (3, 2, 0, 2, 1)$$ The $3$ in the answer comes from there being three distinct digits in the input $\{0, 2, 3\}$ . The next elements come from: ""there are two 0's in the input"", ""there are zero 1's in the input"", ""there are two 2's in the input"", and ""there is one 3 in the input"". Now, the question is: what are the fixed points of this function $f_n$ , i.e. what values of $\bf{x}$ make $f_n(\bf{x}) = \bf{x}$ ? We can immediately reduce this problem to a finite number of cases, because everything in the image of $f_n$ consists only of tuples whose maximum value is $n$ . That is to say, we can compute the fixed points directly. Now, I've written a handy script to compute all of the fixed points for $n \leq 30$ , and it's from this that I want to present the theorem. $n \leq 11$ seems to be mostly chaos, but when $n \geq 12$ , a pattern starts to emerge. Theorem: For $n \geq 12$ , there are exactly two fixed points of $f_n$ .

Do I have to define a specific function and then show that it's one-to-one and onto, or is it enough to say that such a function exists? How can I show that it's bijective? A specific question that I was having issues with is as follows For integers ${n\ge 1}$ , ${t\ge 2}$ , use a bijection to prove that: $${n + t - 1 \choose t - 1} = \sum_{k=0}^n{n-k+t-2 \choose t-2}$$ I tried breaking it down: the LHS is just the number of possible multisets with n elements of $t$ types (or the number of $t-1$ element subsets of a set with $n+t-1$ elements).  The RHS, on the other hand, for a fixed $k$ gives the number of multisets with $n-k-1$ elements with $t-1$ types. Now this is where I am unsure of how to continue, i.e. how to define a bijection between these two sets. Some ideas I had: Let $S$ be the set of all possible $(t-1)$ -element subsets of $S' = \{1, 2,\ldots, n+t-1\}$ . This represents the LHS. Then let $A$ be the set of all possible $(t-2)$ element subsets of $A' = \{k+1, k+2,\ldots, n + t - 1\}$ . Clearly when $k = 0$ then the $A' = S'$ . But clearly $|S| \gt |A| $ since $ t-1 \gt t-2$ so I'm not really sure how to continue here. I suppose $ S' = \{1, 2, \ldots , k\}\cup A'$ but I'm not really sure if that helps me.

The integers are now [1,1]. This leads to a situation as in the previous case and Alice wins.","Alice and Bob are playing a number game in which they write $N$ positive integers. Then the players take turns, Alice took first turn. In a turn : A player selects one of the integers, divides it by $2, 3, 4, 5$ or $6$, and then takes the floor to make it an integer again. If the integer becomes 0, it is erased from the board. The player who makes the last move wins. Assuming both play optimally, we need to predict who wins the game. Example : Let N=2 and numbers are [3,4] then alice is going to win this one. Explanation : Alice can win by selecting 4 and then dividing it by 2. The integers on the board are now [3,2].  Bob can make any choice, but Alice will always win. Bob can divide 2 by 3, 4, 5 or 6, making it 0 and removing it. Now only one integer remains on the board, 3, and Alice can just divide it by 6 to finish, and win, the game. Bob can divide 3 by 4, 5 or 6, making it 0 and removing it.

Proven generalization to the Hockey Stick patterns in Pascal's Triangle,,"English translation. You can see the original - deprecated - in Portuguese here Hi, I arrived at a generalization for the Hockey Stick Patterns, from our beloved Pascal's Triangle. This generalization involves the product of pairs of binomial numbers, and therefore reassembles Vandermonde's Identity  $$\sum \limits_{j=0}^{r}{m\choose j}{q-m\choose r-j}={q\choose r}\tag a$$ According to identity $(8)$ on the wikipedia page Binomial Coefficient we have the following looking similar formula $$\sum \limits_{m=0}^{q}{m\choose j}{q-m\choose r-j}={q+1\choose r+1}\tag b$$ Let's get to the point! As we know, the RHS Pattern (Right Hockey Stick) is related to columns and tells us that $${n+1\choose p+1}=\sum \limits_{k=0}^{n-p}{n-k\choose p}\tag 1$$ Letting $d$ be the displacement - referring to columns - between $\displaystyle {n+1\choose p+1}$ and the stick/column itself - what we have today is a particular case when $d=0$ - we'll have the following for $0 \le d \le p-1$: $${n+1\choose p+1}=\sum \limits_{k=0}^{n-p}{d+k\choose d}{n-d-k\choose p-d}\tag 2$$ In this case, we see a generalization is possible by introducting another column, the column $d$.  And both columns are aligned to each other. Proof From $(2)$ we have $k\gt n-p$ $\longrightarrow$ $n-d-k\lt p-d$ $$ \longrightarrow \sum \limits_{k=0}^{n-p}{d+k\choose d}{n-d-k\choose p-d}=\sum \limits_{k=0}^{n}{d+k\choose d}{n-d-k\choose p-d}$$ Letting $m = d + k; j = d; q = n; r = p$; And $0\leq k\leq n$ $\longrightarrow$ $d\leq d+k\leq n+d$ $\longrightarrow$ $j\leq m\leq q+j$ So, we have $$\sum \limits_{k=0}^{n}{d+k\choose d}{n-d-k\choose p-d}=\sum \limits_{m=j}^{q+j}{m\choose j}{q-m\choose r-j}$$ $m<j$ $\longrightarrow$ $\displaystyle{m\choose j}=0$ $m>q$ $\longrightarrow$ $\displaystyle{q-m\choose r-j}=0$ $$ \longrightarrow \sum \limits_{m=j}^{q+j}{m\choose j}{q-m\choose r-j}=\sum \limits_{m=0}^{q}{m\choose j}{q-m\choose r-j}$$ According to $(b)$, $$\sum \limits_{m=0}^{q}{m\choose j}{q-m\choose r-j}={q+1\choose r+1}={n+1\choose p+1}$$ As expected. Now let's get to the LHS pattern (Left Hockey Stick) - which is related to diagonals - that says $${n+1\choose p}=\sum \limits_{k=0}^p{n-k\choose p-k}\tag 3$$ Calling $d$ the displacement - referring to diagonals - between $\displaystyle {n+1\choose p}$ and the stick/diagonal - what we have today is a particular case when $d=0$. For $0 \le d \le n-p-1$, we have $${n+1\choose p}=\sum \limits_{k=0}^p {d+k\choose k}{n-d-k\choose p-k}\tag 4$$ Now, we see a generalization is possible by introducting another diagonal, the diagonal $d$.

They are about using Dilworth's Theorem to prove Hall's Marriage Theorem (did it) and a mild extension of it (can't do it). Dilworth's Theorem: Let $E$ be a finite ordered set and $k$ be the maximal number of elements of an antichain in $E$. Then there exists a partition of $E$ into $k$ totally ordered sets. Hall's Marriage Theorem: Let $E$ and $F$ be two finite sets and let $x\rightarrow A(x)$ be a mapping of $E$ into $\mathfrak{P}(F)$ such that $\text{Card}(\bigcup_{x\in H}A(x))\geq\text{Card}(H)$ for any subset $H$ of $E$. Then there exists an injection $f$ of $E$ into $F$ such that $f(x)\in A(x)$ for each $x\in E$. To prove it, one defines an ordering on the disjoint union of $E$ and $F$ such that $x>y$ if and only if $x\in E$ and $y\in F$ and $y\in A(x)$. It is easy to see that $F$ is an antichain and that there is no antichain with more elements than $F$. So there exists a partition of $E\sqcup F$ into $\text{Card}(F)$ totally ordered sets, which are necessarily either one-point subsets of $F$ or pairs $\{x,y\}$ such that $y\in A(x)$. Those pairs define the asserted injection. Hall's Marriage Theorem (Extended Version): In the setting of above, suppose additionally that $G$ is a subset of $F$ and for each $L\subset G$, $\text{Card}(\{x\in E|A(x)\cap L\neq\emptyset\})\geq\text{Card}(L)$. Then we can choose $f$ as above with the additional property $G\subset f(E)$. The proof is sketched by Bourbaki as follows: Consider the disjoint union of $G$, $F$, and $E$, which I denote here as $(\{1\}\times G)\cup(\{2\}\times F)\cup(\{3\}\times E)$, and define an ordering on it by setting as only relations $(1,z)<(2,y)$ if and only if $z=y$ $(1,z)<(3,x)$ if and only if $z\in A(x)$ $(2,y)<(3,x)$ if and only if $y\in A(x)$ Then apply Dilworth's Theorem. The problem is that I don't quite know how. The greatest number of elements in an antichain is again $\text{Card}(F)$. So we get a partition of $G\sqcup F\sqcup E$ into $\text{Card}(F)$ totally ordered sets. Again, each of those sets contains exactly one element of $F$, at most one of $E$, and at most one of $G$. This way we can define an injection $f$ as before by defining $f(x)$ to be the element of $F$ which lies in the same set of the partition as $x$, but for $G\subset f(E)$ to hold, every set of the partition which contains an element of $G$ would have to contain an element of $E$ as well. But that's obviously not true for all partitions of $G\sqcup F\sqcup E$ into $\text{Card}(F)$ totally ordered sets.

Basically, tetrahedral numbers can be decomposed in the following way: $$\begin{array}{ l l }  \text{Tet}(1) = 1: & 1 \\  \text{Tet}(2) = 4: & 2+2 \\  \text{Tet}(3) = 10: & 3+4+3 \\  \text{Tet}(4) = 20: & 4+6+6+4 \\  \text{Tet}(5) = 35: & 5+8+9+8+5 \end{array}$$ In general, a tetrahedral number can be decomposed as such: $$\text{Tet}(n)=\sum_{k=1}^n k(n-k+1)$$ Then, the OEIS page states that once we decompose the tetrahedral numbers in this fashion, we can arrive at the goal number triangle by a Stirling-like process (whatever that's supposed to mean). I can't figure out what the process is, and thus how to find the closed form (if it even exists). Any help would be appreciated. UPDATE: I found a heuristic algorithm for computing the rows of the number triangle. For example, take the 5th row of the number triangle (1 32 67 20 1). It can be calculated like this: STEP 1: list the specific combinations of $4 \choose 1$ as such: oxxx, xoxx, xxox, xxxo Now, take the paired decomposition of the 4th tetrahedral number (here: 4 6 6 4) and assign these integers to the four respective slots in the diagram above. Whenever o is at a specific slot, that's the value of the combination. Finally, sum the values of all combinations together. $4+6+6+4=20$ . STEP 2: now, list the combinations of $4\choose 2$ : ooxx, oxox, oxxo, xoox, xoxo, xxoo Take the paired decompositon of the 3rd tetrahedral number (here: 3 4 3). This time each combination will have a slightly different (more general) numbering scheme of slots. Start with a $3$ (the first number in the paired decomposition) on the left. Whenever you encounter an ""o"", repeat the number assigned to that slot for the next slot. Whenever you encounter an ""x"" simply continue parsing through the paired decomposition. The value of a combination will be the multiplication of all slot values where an ""o"" occurs. For example: ooxx will have a value of $3\cdot 3=9$ because we start numbering the slots with a $3$ . Then we repeat the $3$ for the second slot because we had an ""o"". So the values of individual slots are $3,3,4,3$ . The first two slots have the ""o""s so the value of the combination is $3\cdot 3=9$ . Another example: xoox will have a value of $4\cdot 4=16$ because we start numbering with a $3$ . Then we go to next number in the decomposition sequence ( $4$ ) because we have an ""x"". But we have an ""o"" in the second slot, so the value of the third slot is 4 as well. So the values of the individual slots in order are $3,4,4,3$ and we have ""o""s in the middle two positions, so the value of the combination is $4\cdot 4=16$ . We do this for the rest of the combinations, and sum the values of all of the combinations, resulting in $9+12+9+16+12+9$ (respectively), which is $67$ . STEP 3: now, list the combinations of $4\choose 3$ : ooox, ooxo, oxoo, xooo Repeat the same procedure for numbering slots, but this time with the decomposition of the 2nd tetrahedral number (here: 2 2). The values of each combination end up being $8,8,8,8$ respectively ( $2^3$ in each case). Finally, sum all of the combination values to end up with $8+8+8+8=32$ . FINAL STEP: take all of the sums from all of the steps, and arrange them in the reverse order. So here, $32, 67, 20$ . Notice how these are the three non-trivial entries of the 5th row of the desired number triangle. You can generalize this algorithm to generate any $n$ th row by simply listing the combinations of $n-1\choose k$ in each $k$ th step, numbering the slots using the paired decomposition of $(n-k)$ th tetrahedral number, finding the values of each combination by multiplying the values of slots with ""o""s, and finally summing the  values of each combination for that step. The sums in reverse order will spell out the $n$ th row of the triangle. Note that I ommited steps $0$ and $n-1$ as they will always trivially sum to $1$ (multiplication over the empty set in the $0$ th step and multiplication of $n-1$ ones in the last step). Also note that I have no idea why this algorithm generates the number triangle, I just found it by using very messy heuristic logic. I still need help in arriving at the final closed form formula for the sequence, and trying to derive the Stirling-like process that the author of the OEIS page had in mind.","I was working on a combinatorics problem that arose from one of my mathematical excursions, and the final formula includes numbers from a sequence that I've never encountered before: https://oeis.org/A080416 The sequence is actually a number triangle, which looks like this: My goal is to find a closed form formula (not a generating function) for the number triangle , but I don't even understand how this sequence is formed. I understand the ""paired decomposition of tetrahedral numbers"" part of the derivation. Basically, tetrahedral numbers can be decomposed in the following way: In general, a tetrahedral number can be decomposed as such: Then, the OEIS page states that once we decompose the tetrahedral numbers in this fashion, we can arrive at the goal number triangle by a Stirling-like process (whatever that's supposed to mean). I can't figure out what the process is, and thus how to find the closed form (if it even exists). Any help would be appreciated.

57,Counting Binary Sequences (Juggling States) with Constraints,Counting Binary Sequences (Juggling States) with Constraints,,"Short version: Consider a set of positive integers $\{m_i\}_{i=1}^n$ with $m_i < m_{i+1}$ and form an infinite binary sequence $s$ with $b$ $1$ s and arbitrarily many $0$ s subject to the following constraint: If there is a $0$ in position $j$ , i.e., $s_j = 0$ , then $s_{j+m_i} = 0$ for all $i$ . It follows that $s_{j+M} = 0$ for any $M = \sum_i a_i m_i$ , where the $a_i$ are non-negative integers. We can thus remove from the set any $m_i$ that is a multiple of some other $m_i'$ . How many such sequences are there for fixed $b$ and $\{m_i\}$ ? (Feel free to only consider $n = 2$ if it helps.) Medium version: The binary sequences described above are known as juggling states with $b$ balls, specifically those that are contained in juggling patterns of period $m_i$ for all $i$ . For more on juggling states, see this paper . Several properties of these states are quickly clear. We let $N(b)$ be the number of states with $b$ $1$ s. All states start with either a $0$ or a $1$ , so we can write $N(b) = N_1(b) + N_0(b)$ . Any state with $b$ $1$ s can be mapped to a state with $b+1$ $1$ s by simply prepending a $1$ to the state, so it follows that $N_1(b) = N(b-1)$ . We then find, for $b > 1$ , $$N_0(b) = N(b) - N(b-1).$$ Thus if we know $N(1)$ and $N_0(b)$ for all $b$ , we can find $N(b)$ . In general, letting $N_x(b)$ denote the number of states with some initial sequence $x$ , we can use the same trick to show that $N_{1x}(b) = N_x(b-1)$ , where by $1x$ we mean $x$ with a prepended $1$ . Setting $d = \gcd(m_1, \ldots, m_n)$ , we can make some additional observations. If $d = 1$ , $N_0(b)$ must be $0$ for sufficiently large $b$ , and thus $N(b)$ must be eventually constant, since after the first $0$ there will be finitely many positions where the $b$ $1$ s can be placed, as every sufficiently large positive integer is expressible in the form $\sum_i a_i m_i$ . Thus when $b$ is sufficiently large, the only states that are found for $b+1$ are the same $N(b)$ states with an additional $1$ prepended. For general $d$ , letting $N_{0^k}(b)$ be the number of states with $b$ $1$ s beginning with $k$ consecutive $0$ s, we can prove that $N_{0^d}(b)$ is $0$ for sufficiently large $b$ . (We let $k = 0$ represent $N(b)$ .) In every case I have tried, I have found that for $k < d$ , $N_{0^k}(b)$ is a polynomial of degree $d - k - 1$ for sufficiently large $b$ , so $N(b)$ is eventually a polynomial of degree $d - 1$ , but I am unable to prove this. Long version: To phrase this more technically, we use the concept of a numerical semigroup (Wikipedia link) , which is an infinite set of nonnegative integers containing $0$ that is closed under addition. Every element of a numerical semigroup $S$ can be written in the form $\sum_i a_i n_i$ for some finite set of non-negative integers $\{n_i\}$ with $\gcd(n_1, \ldots, n_r) = 1$ , which are called the generators of $S$ . We can then denote $S$ as $\langle n_1, \ldots, n_r\rangle$ . The positive integers not contained in $S$ are called the gaps of $S$ , and the number of gaps is denoted $g(S)$ . We see that for $d=1$ , the positions of the zeros in the state, minus the position of the first $0$ , form a numerical semigroup, specifically $S = \langle m_1, \ldots, m_n\rangle$ . The gaps of $S$ are the possible positions for the $1$ s after the first $0$ . It follows that $N_0(b) = 1$ for $b = g(S)$ , when all the gaps are filled, and $N_0(b) = 0$ for $b > g(S)$ . We can extend this to general $d$ by only looking at the positions of the $0$ s, minus the position of the first $0$ , that are congruent to $0$ modulo $d$ . For example, for $\{m_i\} = \{4,10\}$ , where $d = 2$ , we see that the positions after the first $0$ where there must be additional $0$ s are (4,8,10,12,14,...). Including $0$ to account for the first $0$ , these values are the elements of the numerical semigroup $S = \langle 2,5 \rangle$ multiplied by 2. We see that $g(S) = 2$ , corresponding to the positions 2 and 6. Thus if we have $0$ s in positions $0$ and $1$ , it follows that the state can only have $1$ s in positions 2, 3, 6, and 7. Thus $N_{00}(b) = 1$ for $b = 4$ and $N_{00}(b) = 0$ for $b > 4$ . In general, we can use this numerical semigroup analysis to show that $N_{0^d}(b) = 1$ for $b = d \cdot g(S)$ and $N_{0^d}(b) = 0$ for $b > d \cdot g(S)$ , where $S = \left\langle \frac{m_1}{d}, \ldots, \frac{m_n}{d}\right\rangle$ . However, it is unclear how to work backwards from this point to show that $N(b)$ must eventually be a polynomial of degree $d – 1$ . One possible route would be to extend the identity $N_0(b) = N(b) – N(b–1)$ to states with more initial $0$ s. Empirically, we find $$ N_{0^{k+1}}(b) = N_{0^k}(b) - N_{0^k}(b-1)$$ for $0 \leq k \leq d–1$ , but I have been unable to prove it. We can rewrite the right hand side as $$\begin{align*} N_{0^k}(b) - N_{0^k}(b-1)  &= N_{0^{k+1}}(b) + N_{0^k 1}(b) - N_{0^k}(b-1)\\ &= N_{0^{k+1}}(b) + N_{0^k 1}(b) - N_{10^k}(b), \end{align*}$$ so it follows that proving the desired identity is equivalent to proving $N_{0^k 1}(b) = N_{10^k}(b)$ for $0 \leq k \leq d–1$ , but I have been unable to do this either. In either form, this identity, combined with the already proven fact that $N_{0^d}(b)$ is eventually 0, would be sufficient to showing that $N(b)$ is a polynomial of degree $d-1$ for sufficiently large $b$ , so any ideas would be helpful.","Short version: Consider a set of positive integers with and form an infinite binary sequence with s and arbitrarily many s subject to the following constraint: If there is a in position , i.e., , then for all .

For gcd(a,b,c)=1 problem I: tags are after which we stop. We don't need 3B: or 6A: tags. We neither need to construct the graph nor traverse it. And it indeed clocks less than a sec for n=1000000. But for pairwise gcd=1 problem we need to exclude/include more scenarios.So lets proceed. gcd(a,b)>1 or gcd(b,c)>1 or gcd(c,a)>1 Case: For each of the items labelled 3B: he adds an edge from first mu node to first f node with weight equal to either of first f[i] value outside the first pathesis. in 3B:(mu[1] * f[2] + mu[2] * f[1]) * f[2] * f[2] (mu[1] * f[2] + mu[2] * f[1]) part is for selecting an item in a column which is not multiple of 2 .wile the other two columns have multiple of 2 . 3 in 3B is C(3 1) for permuting this column either at start , middle or end. Essentially for all pair of factors of i we draw edge from smaller factor to larger factor with weight f[i] .If the edge already exist we skip that. For 6 all pair of factors are: 1,2  =>already edge exists with weight f[2] so will skip 1,3  =>already edge exists with weight f[3] so will skip 1,6  =>draw edge with weight f[6] 2,3  =>draw edge with weight f[6] 2,6  =>draw edge with weight f[6] 3,6  =>draw edge with weight f[6] Tiangle counting: Note Neither for I: labeled values nor for 3B: labeled values the graph is required. The graph is being constructed for 6A: values mark[c] denotes wheather it has been traversed earlier as first distance. if yes it has value equal to weight of edge used to traverse to it. Before traversing node a , for each edge incident on a we mark the source node in by weight and clear it once traversing a case is complete. So mark[c] to have a valid value node x has to be node a . Hence a triangle. w1 * w2 * mark[c] is equivalent to w1 * w2 * wc The overall Time complexity = O(n+E + E^1.5 ) = $O(n+nlogn+(nlogn)^{1.5})$ for n=1000000, its around = $O(n+10n+430n)$ = $4*10^8$ Since median of factors of a number is its square root we managed to get a sparse graph, so time complexity is order of $(nlogn)^{1.5}$ . If graph was dense ie $E=n^2$ then triangle finding is $O(n^3)$ when we arrive at complexity similar to @mike-earnest 's answer.

For gcd(a,b,c)=1 problem I: tags are after which we stop. We don't need 3B: or 6A: tags. We neither need to construct the graph nor traverse it. And it indeed clocks less than a sec for n=1000000. But for pairwise gcd=1 problem we need to exclude/include more scenarios.So lets proceed. gcd(a,b)>1 or gcd(b,c)>1 or gcd(c,a)>1 Case: For each of the items labelled 3B: he adds an edge from first mu node to first f node with weight equal to either of first f[i] value outside the first pathesis. in 3B:(mu[1] * f[2] + mu[2] * f[1]) * f[2] * f[2] (mu[1] * f[2] + mu[2] * f[1]) part is for selecting an item in a column which is not multiple of 2 .wile the other two columns have multiple of 2 . 3 in 3B is C(3 1) for permuting this column either at start , middle or end. Essentially for all pair of factors of i we draw edge from smaller factor to larger factor with weight f[i] .If the edge already exist we skip that. For 6 all pair of factors are: 1,2  =>already edge exists with weight f[2] so will skip 1,3  =>already edge exists with weight f[3] so will skip 1,6  =>draw edge with weight f[6] 2,3  =>draw edge with weight f[6] 2,6  =>draw edge with weight f[6] 3,6  =>draw edge with weight f[6] Tiangle counting: Note Neither for I: labeled values nor for 3B: labeled values the graph is required. The graph is being constructed for 6A: values mark[c] denotes wheather it has been traversed earlier as first distance. if yes it has value equal to weight of edge used to traverse to it. Before traversing node a , for each edge incident on a we mark the source node in by weight and clear it once traversing a case is complete. So mark[c] to have a valid value node x has to be node a . Hence a triangle. w1 * w2 * mark[c] is equivalent to w1 * w2 * wc The overall Time complexity = O(n+E + E^1.5 ) = for n=1000000, its around = = Since median of factors of a number is its square root we managed to get a sparse graph, so time complexity is order of . If graph was dense ie then triangle finding is when we arrive at complexity similar to @mike-earnest 's answer.

72,Another variant of cops and robber.,Another variant of cops and robber.,,"I am considering the following variant of the cops and robber problem, apologies if this is well-known and references are welcomed. The set up. Let $G=(V,E)$ be a simple finite undirected graph. A robber function on $G$ is some $R:\mathbb Z_{\ge 0}\to V$ such that $R(t)$ and $R(t+1)$ are adjacent vertices in $G$ , in particular $R(t)\neq R(t+1)$ for all $t$ (there are no loops in $G$ , and the robber is always ""on the move""). A cop strategy on $G$ is any function $C:\mathbb Z_{\ge 0}\to V$ , with no restriction whatsoever. We say the cop strategy $C$ captures robber $R$ if there exists some $t\in \mathbb Z_{\ge 0}$ such that $C(t)=R(t)$ . Denote $T(C,R)$ to be smallest such $t$ if exist, otherwise set it to $\infty$ . If $T(C,R) = \infty$ , then we say $R$ avoids or evades capture by $C$ . Finally, we say the graph $G$ has a sure-capture strategy if there exists a cop strategy $C$ such that for all robber function $R$ , we have $T(C,R)$ finite. Examples. If $G$ is a path graph, then $G$ has a sure-capture strategy. If $G$ is a claw with three branches, each branch with two edges, then $G$ has a sure-capture strategy. Both of above can be analyzed by looking at the parity of the possible starting positions of the robber, as these are bipartite graphs. In fact, If $G$ is a star-like graph with $n\ge 3$ branches, and each branch having two edges, then $G$ has a sure-capture strategy. (Here $G$ has $2n+1$ vertices.) Sketch. Denote the center point of $G$ as $c$ , and branch $i$ consists of vertices $a_i$ and $b_i$ , where $a_i$ is connected to both $c$ and $b_i$ . If $n$ is odd, consider the cop strategy $C$ given by $a_1,c,a_1,c,a_2,c,\ldots,a_n,a_1,c,a_1,c,a_2,c,\ldots,a_n$ . The first half ensures robber is captured if robber starts at any $a_i$ position. Now if we haven't captured the robber in the first half, then the robber must started at a $b_i$ position, which after the first half now lands in an $a_i$ position, so we repeat the strategy again. We can adapt it similarly when $n$ is even. Some questions. What simple finite graph has a sure-capture strategy? [We can easily show that if $G$ has any cycle, then $G$ does not have any sure-capture strategy. Indeed, if to the contrary that cop strategy $C$ is a sure-capture strategy on $G$ with some cycle, we can use $C$ to produce a robber function $R$ that always avoid capture, as each vertex on said cycle has degree $\ge 2$ .] So they must be forests. Consider then $G$ to be connected. Then $G$ has a sure-capture strategy implies $G$ is a tree. Do all trees have a sure-capture strategy? I am not so sure here, for a claw with three branches, but each branch with 3 or more edges in it, is there a sure-capture strategy?

83,Catalan number and Cayley distance inequality in permutation group,Catalan number and Cayley distance inequality in permutation group,,"Problem statement This is the part that I think is analytically tractable. The Cayley distance of element $g_1$ to $g_2$ is the smallest number of transposition that transforms $g_1$ to $g_2$. It is left and right invariant, so \begin{equation} d( g_1, g_2) = d( I, g_1^{-1} g_2 ) = d( I, g_2 g_1^{-1} )  \end{equation} The distance to the identity element is just $ n$ minus the number of cycles in the cycle notation. By definition, the distance satisfies triangle inequality \begin{equation} d( g_1, g_2 ) + d( g_1, g_3 ) \ge d( g_2, g_3 ) \end{equation} In particular, \begin{equation} d( I, g ) + d( I, \tau g ) \ge d( g, \tau g ) = d( I, \tau)  \end{equation} Now for a fixed element $\tau = (123\cdots n )$, I want to find the number of elements $a_n$(in terms of $n$) that saturate the triangle inequality, \begin{equation} a_n = \text{Cardinality}\{ g \in S_n |  d( I, g) + d( I, \tau g ) = d( I, \tau) = n - 1 \} \end{equation} For the first few $n$, $a_{2} = 2, a_3 = 5, a_4 = 14$. UPDATE As @san pointed out, $a_n$ is likely to be the Catalan number . So I checked it numerically using sage: up to $n = 10$ $a_n$ agrees with the Catalan number! \begin{equation} \begin{aligned} a_2 &= 2,\quad  a_3 = 5, \quad a_4 = 14,\quad a_5 = 42,\quad a_6 = 132, \\ a_7 &= 429, \quad a_8 = 1430,\quad a_9 = 4862,\quad a_{10} = 16796 \end{aligned} \end{equation} Moreover, its derivative is the wanted $\frac{1}{2}$, \begin{equation} \partial_n \frac{2n!}{n!(n+1)!}\Big|_{n = 1}  = \partial_n \frac{1}{n(n+1) B( n, n+ 1)}\Big|_{n = 1} = \frac{1}{2} \end{equation} So I think this is should be an accurate guess, and we shall seek for a proof. @san suggested to prove \begin{equation} a_{n, n-k} = \text{Cardinality}\{g \in S_n | d( I, g ) = n-k, d( I, \tau g ) = k - 1 \} = \frac{1}{k} {n \choose k - 1 } {n - 1 \choose k-1} \end{equation} such that \begin{equation} a_n = \sum_{k=1}^n a_{n, n-k} = \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k} {n \choose k - 1 } {n - 1 \choose k-1} = \frac{2n!}{n! (n+1)!} = C_n \end{equation} Perhaps a recursive route to prove \begin{equation} a_n = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_{i} a_{n-1-i} \end{equation} is possible. If $g$ can be decomposed as a permutation of the first $k$ elements $g_1$ and permutation of the rest $n-k$ elements $g_2$, then set $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ to be the shift operation in these corresponding smaller permutation groups, we have \begin{equation} d(I, g ) + d(I, \tau g ) =  d(I, g_1) + d( I, \tau_1 g_1) + d(I, g_2) + d(I, \tau_2 g_2 ) + 1 \le k-1 + n-k-1 + 1 = n-1 \end{equation} The only way to saturate the bound is that both $g_1$ and $g_2$ staturate the bound in the smaller permutation group, hence in for these $g$ the top coefficient is $a_k a_{n-k}$. But obviously chosing different pivot $k$ overcounts, so I still can not construct a recursive formula relating $a_n$ and $\sum_k a_k a_{n-k}$. Original post: a more general problem I was looking for the analytic expression(need to take derivative latter) of following polynomial  \begin{equation} f_n(x, y) = \sum_{g \in S_n} x^{\chi(g)} y^{\chi( \tau g )} \end{equation} where $g$ is taken from the permutation group $S_n$, the exponent $\chi(g)$ are number of cycles in the cycle notation of $g$, and $\tau$ is a fixed element in $S_n$: $\tau = (123\cdots n )$, i.e. it puts $1$ in the end and shift each letter forward. Maybe it should not be called generating function but I don't have a proper name for it. A few example will clarity the definition. When $n = 4$, taking $g = (12)(3)(4)$, there are 3 cycles(including the cycle of length 1), so $\chi( g ) = 3$. On the other hand,  \begin{equation} \tau g = (1234) \cdot (12) (3)(4) = (134)(2)  \end{equation} so $\chi( \tau g ) = 2$, the corresponding monomial of $g$ is $x^3 y^2$. Summing over the monomials of all the elements of $S_n$ gives $f_n(x, y)$. I have computed the case of $n = 2,3,4$, the results are \begin{equation} \begin{aligned} f_2(x,y) &= x^2 y + x y^2 \\  f_3(x,y) &= x^3 y + 3x^2 y^2 + x y^3 + xy \\  f_4(x,y) &= x^4 y + 6 x^3 y^2 + 6x^2 y^3 + x y^4 + 5 x^2 y + 5 x y^2  \end{aligned} \end{equation} It would be ideal to have the analytic expression of all the coefficients, but I'm mostly interested in the coefficient of highest power of $f_n(x,x)$ \begin{equation} f_n(x,x) = a_{n} x^{n+1} + \cdots  \end{equation} I'd like to obtain the analytic expression of $a_n$, which is the same $a_n$ in the problem statement. $\chi(g)$ and Cayley distance I read a relevant post about number of cycles and learned that the function $\chi(g)$ is related to the Cayley distance \begin{equation} d( I, g ) = n - \chi( g )  \end{equation} The power of $x$ in $f_n(x,x)$ is \begin{equation} \begin{aligned} \chi( g) + \chi(\tau g )  &= 2n - d( I, g ) - d( I, \tau g ) \\ &\le 2n - d( g, \tau g ) = 2n - d( I, g^{-1} \tau g ) \\ &= 2n - d(I, \tau) = n + \chi(\tau)  = n +1  \end{aligned} \end{equation} so the coefficients $a_n$ is just the number of elements that saturate the Cayley distance triangle inequality \begin{equation} d( I, g ) + d( I , \tau g ) = d( I, g^{-1} \tau g ) = n - 1 \end{equation} Generating function From this MO post , there is a nice formula for $f_n( x, 1 )$, which is \begin{equation} f_n( x, 1 ) = \sum_{g\in S_n} x^{\chi(g )}  = \prod_{k=1}^{n-1} (x + k ) \end{equation} and there is a nice bijective proof here EDIT I obtained through an independent non-rigorous approach that $\partial_n a_n\Big|_{n=1} = \frac{1}{2}$, but I still do no know the analytic expression for $a_n$","Problem statement This is the part that I think is analytically tractable.

So I checked it numerically using sage: up to $n = 10$ $a_n$ agrees with the Catalan number! \begin{equation} \begin{aligned} a_2 &= 2,\quad  a_3 = 5, \quad a_4 = 14,\quad a_5 = 42,\quad a_6 = 132, \\ a_7 &= 429, \quad a_8 = 1430,\quad a_9 = 4862,\quad a_{10} = 16796 \end{aligned} \end{equation} Moreover, its derivative is the wanted $\frac{1}{2}$, \begin{equation} \partial_n \frac{2n!}{n!(n+1)!}\Big|_{n = 1}  = \partial_n \frac{1}{n(n+1) B( n, n+ 1)}\Big|_{n = 1} = \frac{1}{2} \end{equation} So I think this is should be an accurate guess, and we shall seek for a proof. @san suggested to prove \begin{equation} a_{n, n-k} = \text{Cardinality}\{g \in S_n | d( I, g ) = n-k, d( I, \tau g ) = k - 1 \} = \frac{1}{k} {n \choose k - 1 } {n - 1 \choose k-1} \end{equation} such that \begin{equation} a_n = \sum_{k=1}^n a_{n, n-k} = \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k} {n \choose k - 1 } {n - 1 \choose k-1} = \frac{2n!}{n! (n+1)!} = C_n \end{equation} Perhaps a recursive route to prove \begin{equation} a_n = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_{i} a_{n-1-i} \end{equation} is possible. If $g$ can be decomposed as a permutation of the first $k$ elements $g_1$ and permutation of the rest $n-k$ elements $g_2$, then set $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ to be the shift operation in these corresponding smaller permutation groups, we have \begin{equation} d(I, g ) + d(I, \tau g ) =  d(I, g_1) + d( I, \tau_1 g_1) + d(I, g_2) + d(I, \tau_2 g_2 ) + 1 \le k-1 + n-k-1 + 1 = n-1 \end{equation} The only way to saturate the bound is that both $g_1$ and $g_2$ staturate the bound in the smaller permutation group, hence in for these $g$ the top coefficient is $a_k a_{n-k}$. But obviously chosing different pivot $k$ overcounts, so I still can not construct a recursive formula relating $a_n$ and $\sum_k a_k a_{n-k}$. Original post: a more general problem I was looking for the analytic expression(need to take derivative latter) of following polynomial  \begin{equation} f_n(x, y) = \sum_{g \in S_n} x^{\chi(g)} y^{\chi( \tau g )} \end{equation} where $g$ is taken from the permutation group $S_n$, the exponent $\chi(g)$ are number of cycles in the cycle notation of $g$, and $\tau$ is a fixed element in $S_n$: $\tau = (123\cdots n )$, i.e. it puts $1$ in the end and shift each letter forward. Maybe it should not be called generating function but I don't have a proper name for it. A few example will clarity the definition. When $n = 4$, taking $g = (12)(3)(4)$, there are 3 cycles(including the cycle of length 1), so $\chi( g ) = 3$. On the other hand,  \begin{equation} \tau g = (1234) \cdot (12) (3)(4) = (134)(2)  \end{equation} so $\chi( \tau g ) = 2$, the corresponding monomial of $g$ is $x^3 y^2$. Summing over the monomials of all the elements of $S_n$ gives $f_n(x, y)$. I have computed the case of $n = 2,3,4$, the results are \begin{equation} \begin{aligned} f_2(x,y) &= x^2 y + x y^2 \\  f_3(x,y) &= x^3 y + 3x^2 y^2 + x y^3 + xy \\  f_4(x,y) &= x^4 y + 6 x^3 y^2 + 6x^2 y^3 + x y^4 + 5 x^2 y + 5 x y^2  \end{aligned} \end{equation} It would be ideal to have the analytic expression of all the coefficients, but I'm mostly interested in the coefficient of highest power of $f_n(x,x)$ \begin{equation} f_n(x,x) = a_{n} x^{n+1} + \cdots  \end{equation} I'd like to obtain the analytic expression of $a_n$, which is the same $a_n$ in the problem statement. $\chi(g)$ and Cayley distance I read a relevant post about number of cycles and learned that the function $\chi(g)$ is related to the Cayley distance \begin{equation} d( I, g ) = n - \chi( g )  \end{equation} The power of $x$ in $f_n(x,x)$ is \begin{equation} \begin{aligned} \chi( g) + \chi(\tau g )  &= 2n - d( I, g ) - d( I, \tau g ) \\ &\le 2n - d( g, \tau g ) = 2n - d( I, g^{-1} \tau g ) \\ &= 2n - d(I, \tau) = n + \chi(\tau)  = n +1  \end{aligned} \end{equation} so the coefficients $a_n$ is just the number of elements that saturate the Cayley distance triangle inequality \begin{equation} d( I, g ) + d( I , \tau g ) = d( I, g^{-1} \tau g ) = n - 1 \end{equation} Generating function From this MO post , there is a nice formula for $f_n( x, 1 )$, which is \begin{equation} f_n( x, 1 ) = \sum_{g\in S_n} x^{\chi(g )}  = \prod_{k=1}^{n-1} (x + k ) \end{equation} and there is a nice bijective proof here EDIT I obtained through an independent non-rigorous approach that $\partial_n a_n\Big|_{n=1} = \frac{1}{2}$, but I still do no know the analytic expression for $a_n$",,"['combinatorics', 'permutations', 'generating-functions', 'catalan-numbers']"

In the case of permutations, if we are selecting the entire set ($nPn$), then I think it makes sense to effectively treat it like a combination in the sense that each of $k$ types has some number of copies whose order doesn't matter, so the solution would be $\dfrac{n!}{\Pi_{i=1}^k (p_i !)}$. How do we do this calculation when we are not selecting the entire set, and therefore we do not know how many repeats there will be? What if we're interested in combinations instead, so the order doesn't matter? These seem like they should be computable, but I haven't been able to wrap my head around how. One potential example of the latter would be trying to generate the set of all factors of a number given its prime factorization, which could consist of repeats of the same factor.",,['combinatorics']
97,Proving that G contains a cycle with at least $k+1$ edges,Proving that G contains a cycle with at least  edges,k+1,"Let $k\geq 2$. Prove that if $G$ is $k$-regular, then $G$ contains a cycle with at least $k+1$ edges. The way I did it was to prove that the longest path in $G$ must have at least $k$ edges, and that such a path must be one short of a cycle, and thus the longest cycle must contain at least $k+1$ edges. Is this way correct? Are there other more direct ways of approaching this problem? Thanks!","Let $k\geq 2$. Prove that if $G$ is $k$-regular, then $G$ contains a cycle with at least $k+1$ edges.

98,Generating function for $r^\binom{n}{2}$,Generating function for,r^\binom{n}{2},"I'm trying to find a closed form of the generating function $$ G(x) = \sum_{n \ge 0} r^\binom{n}{2} x^n $$ for a real number $0 < r < 1$. I found that $G(x) = 1 + xG(rx)$. Any hints where to go next? Taking into account the answer by @zyx below, let $$ H(x) = \sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}} r^\binom{n}{2} x = \prod_{m\ge1} (1-r^m)(1+r^{m-1} x)(1+r^m x^{-1}), $$ where the equality of the sum and product comes from the Jacobi triple product. Note that $H(rx) = xH(x^{-1})$. Also, using $\binom{-n}{2} = \binom{n+1}{2}$, we can obtain $\sum_{n<0} r^\binom{n}{2} x^n = xG(x^{-1})-x-1$.

99,Sum of squares of multiplicities of differences,Sum of squares of multiplicities of differences,,"It's hard to come up with a good title. Let $A$ be a set of $n$ integers, say $A=\{a_1,\ldots,a_n\}$ with $a_1<\cdots<a_n$. We consider all the positive differences $a_j-a_i$ (necessarily $i<j$). There are $n \choose 2$ pairs $(a_i,a_j)$ with $i<j$, but of course, some differences can be repeated, or in other words, have ""multiplicity"" greater than 1. For a given $A$, one way to illustrate the differences and their multiplicities is with a ""table of differences"". Here is one such table for $A=\{0,1,3,5,6\}$, and another for $A=\{1,4,7,10,13\}$. -| 0 1 3 5 6     - | 1 4 7 10 13 -+----------     --+------------ 0| - 1 3 5 6     1 | - 3 6 9  12 1|   - 2 4 5     4 |   - 3 6  9 3|     - 2 3     7 |     - 3  6 5|       - 1     10|       -  3 6|         -     13|          - We see that if $A=\{0,1,3,5,6\}$, then the differences $1,2,3,5$ each have multiplicity 2, and the differences $4,6$ each have multiplicity 1. We also see that if $A=\{1,4,7,10,13\}$, then the differences $3,6,9,12$ have multiplicities $4,3,2,1$ respectively. My question is: What is a tight upper bound on the sum of the squares of the multiplicities? I conjecture that the answer is $1^2+2^2+3^2+\cdots+(n-1)^2$, which occurs if $A$ consists of $n$ integers in arithmetic progression (as in the second example above). At first, I thought this would be an easy consequence of the following ""lemma"": The largest multiplicity must be at most $n-1$, the second largest multiplicity must be at most $n-2$, the third largest multiplicity must be at most $n-3$, and so on. However, that ""lemma"" is false! In the first example above (in which $n=5$), the four largest multiplicities are $2,2,2,2$, which are not bounded above by $4,3,2,1$ respectively. Note that my conjectured bound grows like $n^3/3$. I'm pretty sure I can find an upper bound that grows like $2n^3/3$, but the gap between those bounds is perplexing me.","It's hard to come up with a good title.
