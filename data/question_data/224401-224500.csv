0,Obtaining a nice map to a curve by using blowups,Obtaining a nice map to a curve by using blowups,,"Let $X$ be a smooth and projective variety over a finite field (separated, finite type, integral). Then after performing a number of blowups I should be able to find a proper surjective map from $X$ to a smooth curve, where the generic fibre is smooth and geometrically integral. My question is really: how? I assume we can use projection away from a hyperplane, yielding a rational map from $X$ to the projective line (if I'm not making any dimension mistakes here). After performing a number of blowups this becomes an everywhere-defined map (right?). But how can I make sure the generic fibre is smooth and geometrically integral? As you can see I think I have an intuition for how things should work. But I'd like to grasp it in all mathematical detail, not just a geometric image in my head. If you would have a general reference for such facts, that would be great already.","Let $X$ be a smooth and projective variety over a finite field (separated, finite type, integral).

1,Chern classes of the associated vector bundle of a branched covering,Chern classes of the associated vector bundle of a branched covering,,"Let $f \colon X \to \mathcal{Q}_7$ be a branched covering of degree $3$ of a $7$-dimensional smooth projective quadric $\mathcal{Q}_7 \subset \mathbb{P}_8$, where $X$ is a smooth connected projective variety. We can define the associated vector bundle $\mathcal{E}$ of rank 2 by $$f_*\mathcal{O}_X = \mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{Q}_7} \oplus \mathcal{E}^*.$$ I want to compute the Chern classes $c_1$ and $c_2$ of the associated bundle $\mathcal{E}$, but I am not very familiar with that. Here is, what I get so far. Since $(f_*\mathcal{O}_X)^*$ is a direct sum, the Chern classes $$c_1((f_*\mathcal{O}_X)^*) = c_1(\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{Q}_7}) + c_1(\mathcal{E})$$ and $$c_2((f_*\mathcal{O}_X)^*) = c_1(\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{Q}_7}).c_1(\mathcal{E}) + c_2(\mathcal{E}),$$ where $c_1(\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{Q}_7}).c_1(\mathcal{E})$ is the cup-product in $H^4(\mathcal{Q}_7, \mathbb{Z})$. On the other hand, I know that $(f_*\mathcal{O}_X)^*$ is the relative canonical bundle $f_*\omega_{X|\mathcal{Q}_7} = f_*K_X \otimes K_{\mathcal{Q}_7}^*$ and $K_{\mathcal{Q}_7} = \mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{Q}_7}(-7)$.

3,Connected component of $0$: why is it an abelian variety?,Connected component of : why is it an abelian variety?,0,"With ""Abelian variety"" I mean a integral scheme $X$, proper over an algebraically closed field (complete variety) with a group law $m: X\times X \rightarrow X$ such that $m$ and the inverse map are both morphisms of varieties. I'm trying to understand the proof of Proposition 10.1 here . This is the situation: We have an abelian variety $X$, an abelian subvariety $Y\subset X$ with inclusion map $i: Y\hookrightarrow X$, an ample line bundle $\mathcal{L}$ on $X$. Hence we have: \begin{equation*} X \xrightarrow{\phi_{\mathcal{L}}} X^\vee\xrightarrow{i^\vee}Y^\vee \end{equation*} and we let $Y'$ be the connected component of $\ker(i^\vee\circ\phi_{\mathcal{L}})=\phi_{\mathcal{L}}^{-1}(\ker i^\vee)$ passing through $0$. The claim now is that $Y'$ is an abelian variety. I'm trying to prove this and those are my thoughts: $Y'\subset \ker(i^\vee\circ\phi_{\mathcal{L}})\subset\ker(\phi_{\mathcal{L}})=K(\mathcal{L})$ connected component implies, by a general fact from topology, that $Y'\subset K(\mathcal{L})$ is closed.

Now, closed immersions are proper and the compostitions of proper morphisms is still proper so $Y'$ is proper over $k$. Furthermore, the connected component of $0$ in a topological group is a closed normal subgroub. Hence $Y'\subset K(\mathcal{L})$ has the group structure. Right?

Why the image is not a point of the form $(a,b)$ with $a$ not a root of $g'(x)$ and $b\neq{0}$?. Now once we know that the image of $(\xi,0)$ is of the form $(\xi',0)$, then it follows that $\phi$ maps the roots of $g(x)$ bijectively onto the roots of $g'(x)$. This is ok.

50,Linking regularity of ideal sheaf with Fitting ideals sheaf,Linking regularity of ideal sheaf with Fitting ideals sheaf,,"I'm reading Eisenbud's book The geometry of syzygies and I'm quite struck undestanding the argument proposed in Chapter 5, in the section named ""Fitting ideals"". Remember that a coherent sheaf $\mathscr{F}$ over a scheme $X$ is called $m$*-regular* if $$H^p(X,\mathscr{F}(m-p))=0$$  for every $p>0$. The minimum $m$ among integers, if it exists, such that $\mathscr{}$ is $m$-regolar is the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity $\mathrm{reg}(\mathscr{F})$. There is an algebraic definition for module that involves (among other things) local cohomology. Let be $X$ an irreducible and smooth projective curve over an algebraically closed field $k$. If we call $I(X)$ the homogeneous saturated ideal of $X$, id est $$ I(X):=\bigoplus_{n\geq 0} \mathscr{I}_X(n) $$ where $\mathscr{I}_X$ is the ideal sheaf of $X$, we know thath $\mathrm{reg}(I(X))=\mathrm{reg}(\mathscr{I}_X)$. Now, let suppose that $X$ comes with a very ample line bundle, i.e. lets assume that $X\subseteq \mathbf{P}^r_k$ for some $r\geq 2$; in this case we have $I(X)\subseteq k[x_0,\ldots,x_r]=:S$ as homogeneous ideal. Let be $\mathscr{L}\in\mathrm{Pic}(X)$, i.e. an invertibile sheaf over $X$ and let be  $$F:=\bigoplus_{n\geq 0} H^0(X,\mathscr{L}(n))$$ the generated cone; it's well known that $F$ is a graded $S$-module and has a free minimal presentation $$L_1\overset{\psi}{\longrightarrow} L_0\longrightarrow F\longrightarrow 0$$ Sheafifying this sequence, we obtain a sequence $$\bigoplus_{j=1}^s \mathscr{O}_{\mathbf{P}^r_k}(-h_j)\overset{\Psi}{\longrightarrow}  \bigoplus_{l=1}^t \mathscr{O}_{\mathbf{P}^r_k}(-l_i)\longrightarrow \mathscr{L}\longrightarrow 0$$ In both cases we can define the 0-th Fitting ideal $I(\psi)$ of $\psi$, that is the ideal generated by $\psi$'s maximal minors; the sheaf $\mathscr{I}(\Psi)$ of Fitting ideals of $\Psi$. The problems that arise are the following: how can we relate the sheaf $\widetilde{I(\psi)}$ to the sheaf $\mathscr{I}(\psi)$? Since Fitting ideals commute with localizations, I find quite reasonable that the two sheafs are isomorphic, but Eisenbud don't even give an hint of a formal way to prove it; What can we say about $\mathrm{reg}(\mathscr{I}(\Psi))$ and $\mathrm{reg}(\mathscr{I}_X)=\mathrm{reg}(I(X))$?

So define the divisor $D = \sigma(C)$ on $X$ and define $\mathscr E = \pi_*(\mathscr L(D))$, where $\mathscr L (D)$ is the sheaf on $X$ corresponding to the divisor $D$. Then $\mathscr E $ is locally free of rank $2$ on $C$ from Grauert's theorem and clearly there is a natural map $$\pi^*(\mathscr E) \to \pi^*(\pi_*(\mathscr L (D))) \to \mathscr L (D).$$ But then there are some parts I do not fully understand (here both $X$ and $C$ are defined over some algebraically closed field): To prove this map $\pi^*(\mathscr E) \to \mathscr L(D)$ is surjective, it says ''by Nakayama's lemma, it is enough to check this on any fiber $X_y$''.

Does an infinitude of intersections imply a common component for the hypersurfaces $f_i'=0$? Would this easily mean that there are nontrivial solutions of ${\bf f}({\bf x})={\bf 0}$? Even worse, I am afraid this isn't true in general (because not everything is a complete intersection...)

We can translate that into the following situation in projective space: Consider $f_i'=f_i({\bf z})-y_i\cdot z_{n+1}^{d_i}$; they are homogeneous in $\mathbb{C}[z_1,z_2,\cdots,z_{n+1}]$) and therefore define $n$ hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{CP}^n$. Now, Bezout's theorem says that if the have finitely many intersection points, those would be at most $d_1d_2\cdots d_n$-many. Evenmore, if an intersection point $[z_1:z_2:\cdots:z_{n+1}]$ has $z_{n+1}\neq 0$ it corresponds (by setting $z_{n+1}=1$ and returning to the affine setting) to a solution of ${\bf f}({\bf x})={\bf y}$. Does an infinitude of intersections imply a common component for the hypersurfaces $f_i'=0$? Would this easily mean that there are nontrivial solutions of ${\bf f}({\bf x})={\bf 0}$? Even worse, I am afraid this isn't true in general (because not everything is a complete intersection...) Remark: Clearly, the direction (has finite fibers) $\Rightarrow\ {\bf f}^{-1}({\bf 0})={\bf 0}$ is obvious, since otherwise, because of homogeneity,  ${\bf 0}$ would have an infinite fiber (a whole line at least).
