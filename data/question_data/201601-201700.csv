26,Isoclinic rotations in four dimensions,Isoclinic rotations in four dimensions,,"Given any collection of complementary, oriented (2D) planes in n-dimensional space, and an angle associated with each one, there is a unique rotation of the whole space which restricts to rotations in each plane by their given angles. Conversely, it's not impossible to prove all rotations of space arise in this way. Which leads to the question: can a single rotation arise in this way but from two different sets of complementary planes? If the attached angles are all distinct, I think the answer is no, which means the collection of stable planes is an invariant of ""almost all"" rotations (in the sense that the set of exceptions are of positive codimension in the group of all rotations). If any two of the attached angles are the same, though, then there are an infinite number of planes which are stable under the rotation. Indeed, it is easy to verify that such a rotation moves every ray from the origin by the same angle. (Compare with rotation around an axis in 3D: if a ray is perpendicular to the axis then it is rotated by the full angle, but otherwise if the ray is closer to the axis, the before and after rays will be less than the full angle apart from each other.) For simplicity, lets just take n=4 so our isoclinic rotations are rotations in two orthogonal planes by the same angle. Depending on if combining the orientations of the planes agrees with the orientation of the whole space or not, we can call them left isoclinic or right isoclinic rotations, because they correspond to multiplying quaternions (which form a 4-dimensional space) either on the left or on the right by unit quaternions. As such, the subgroups of left and right isoclinic rotations are both copies of S^3 within SO(4). Now my curiosity is in which planes are stable under an isoclinic rotation, or without loss of generality a one-parameter subgroup of them. Any 2D plane has a unique orthogonal complement, and to the two resulting planes we get a one-parameter subgroup, which can be identified with a line in the corresponding lie algbera so(3) of dimension 3. Therefore we have some map from the Grassmanian manifold of 2D planes to the projective plane. Characterizing stable planes of a given one-parameter group of isoclinic rotations is then equivalent to finding the fibers of this map, which should all be identical by symmetery. So we have some fiber bundle $$F\to \mathrm{Gr}(2,4)\to\mathbb{P}^2 $$ Is there a good explicit description of the fibers? Or just its isomorphism type? My initial thoughts: Given the fiber $F\subseteq\mathrm{Gr}(2,4)$ of a point in $\mathbb{P}^2$ corresponding to some one-parameter subgroup $H$ of isoclinic rotations, if we have any point $x\in\mathbb{S}^3\subset\mathbb{R}^4$ the orbit $Hx$ is a circle in $\mathbb{S}^3$, which determines a plane $\pi$ in $\mathbb{R}^4$, and indeed $\pi\in F$. So we get a map $\mathbb{S}^3\to F$, and the fibers of this map should be the circles in $\mathbb{S}^3$ which intersect planes $\pi\in F$. Thus we have a fiber bundle $\mathbb{S}^1\to\mathbb{S}^3\to F$, which naively suggests to me $F\cong\mathbb{S}^2$ based on the Hopf fibration. Some folks in chat though suggested $F$ should be $\mathbb{P}^2$ or a couple disjoint copies of it. Also mentioned was the fact that $\widetilde{\mathrm{Gr}}(2,4)$, the oriented Grassmanian which is a double cover of the usual $\mathrm{Gr}(2,4)$, is $\cong \mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{S}^2$, although I don't know why or for sure how to use this.

Now I'm pretty new to clutching functions (A la' Cohen and Hatcher texts on fiber bundles), and I'm not sure how to realize this as the clutching function.  My guess is that since we're dealing with a vector bundle we need the ""linearity"", and this map should be similar to the clutching function for the $S^7$-bundle which I believe is just rotation by octonions.  Also since our map is just repeated multiplication, $x^n$ I think that has a role to play, but that's just a heuristic guess. I've been pouring through texts and papers for days trying to get my head around all of this, so any clarity you can bring would be greatly appreciated!",,"['differential-geometry', 'fiber-bundles', 'k-theory', 'octonions', 'hopf-fibration']"

The identity $T^*(M \times F) = T^*(M) \times T^*(F)$ holds generally (I hope). What can be said about the exterior powers of it? $$\bigwedge^r T^*(M \times F)\cong \space?$$ Motivation: Let $P \to M$ be a fiber bundle with fiber $F$. let $\omega \in \bigwedge^r  T^*P$. Is it possible in general to factor $\omega$ locally as a product of basic forms? Explicitly: given a $p \in M$, does there always exist a neighbourhood $p\in U$ s.t. $\omega|_U$ is a sum of simple forms of the type $\nu \wedge \alpha$ for some basic forms $\nu \in \bigwedge^{r-q} M$ and $\alpha \in\bigwedge^{q} F$?",,"['differential-geometry', 'vector-bundles', 'fiber-bundles', 'exterior-algebra']"
91,Are semi-direct products and fiber products similar constructions in different categories?,Are semi-direct products and fiber products similar constructions in different categories?,,"We have direct product of groups which is basically like attaching two groups together by forming the Cartesian product and defining component-wise multiplication. Similarly, we have product of manifolds which seems to be the same idea. We attach two given manifolds by forming the Cartesian product and then we parameterize it by attaching their coordinates. Then we have a construction called semi-direct product that generalizes the direct product by requiring only one block to be normal. We know that the normal block can be thought of as the kernel of a map.  We know that fiber bundles are a generalization of product manifolds that may be twisted globally, even though they look like product manifolds locally. The thing is that the fibers are projected into one point. So, in some sense it's like they can be somehow thought of as the kernel of some projection. Is there a relation between these two concepts?

92,Does the notion of a vector having direction have any meaning without a metric being defined?,Does the notion of a vector having direction have any meaning without a metric being defined?,,"If one considers a smooth manifold, then it is possible to define (tangent) vectors in the tangent space to each point on that manifold without having to introduce any additional structure such as a metric. As such (tangent) vectors can be defined in terms of equivalence classes of curves (with a tangent vector at a given point defined as an equivalence class of curves through that point that are all tangent to one another at that point), is it correct to say the notion of a vector having ""direction"" is meaningful without needing to introduce a metric, or do the two come hand in hand?

93,Why does the torsion remain invariant under a change of orientation?,Why does the torsion remain invariant under a change of orientation?,,"There is this statement in the book of Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces by Do Carmo page 18 that I have a doubt in.
