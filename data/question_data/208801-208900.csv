I saw that is has been proven that $L(39,7,4,7)=329$. This notation is explained in http://web.archive.org/web/20070824014211/http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~pjc/csgnotes/LottoDesigns.pdf and it goes as follows: In a lotto, one chooses seven distinct numbers $n_1<\ldots < n_7$ from the set $\{1,\ldots,39\}$ and forms a tuple $(n_1,\ldots,n_7)$ called row. It is possible to choose 329 of such rows such that for any arbitrary row $(n_1,\ldots,n_7),$ the set of those 329 rows contains at least one row $(m_1,\ldots,m_7)$ such that $$|\{n_1,n_2,n_3,n_4,n_5,n_6,n_7\}\cap \{m_1,m_2,m_3,m_4,m_5,m_6,m_7\}|\geq 4?$$ I think this result is due to Hämäläinen based on the inequality $$L(39,7,4,7) \leq L(16,7,4,4) + L(23,7,4,4)\leq 76+253=329$$ that I'm not familiar. Now the question: Is it possible to list those $329$ rows from the design $(39,7,4,7)$ explicitly with reasonable time? Is simulated annealing the best algorithm to list those rows? I asked this on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18486523/what-algorithm-is-a-good-to-search-a-lotto-design but it turned out a bad question there.",,"['combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics', 'algorithms', 'combinatorial-designs']"

I think what the definition wants to say is the transitive closure of $R$.

Although this doesn't seem to clear things up, I find the definition of path in directed graph in Discrete Mathematics and its Applications (Kenneth H.Rosen) A path from $a$ to $b$ in the directed graph $G$ is a sequence of edges $(x_0,x_1), (x_1,x_2), (x_2,x_3), \ldots, (x_{n-1},x_n)$ in $G$, where $n$ is a nonnegative integer, and $x_0=a$ and $x_n=b$, that is, a sequence of edges where the terminal vertex of an edge is the same as the initial vertex in the next edge in the path. This path is denoted by $x_0, x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{n-1}, x_n$ and has length $n$. We view the empty set of edges as a path from $a$ to $a$. Thus, I was wrong about the length of $(a,a)$. It is of length 1 not 0. Moreover, the path denoted by just $x_0$ has length $0$. Since there is no edge of this path we view it from $a$ to $a$. It follows that $(a,a) \in R^*$ no matter whether $(a,a) \in R$ which satisfies the definition of reflexive transitive closure .","This a problem on the definition of reflexive transitive closure in Elements of the Theory of Computation (H.R.Lewis).

Edit: here's how the author defines path A path in a binary relation $R$ is a sequence $(a_1, \ldots, a_n)$ for some $n \geq 1$ such that $(a_i, a_{i+1}) \in R$ for $i = 1, \ldots, n-1$; this path is said to be from $a_1$ to $a_n$. The length of a path $(a_1, \ldots, a_n)$ is $n$. Although this doesn't seem to clear things up, I find the definition of path in directed graph in Discrete Mathematics and its Applications (Kenneth H.Rosen) A path from $a$ to $b$ in the directed graph $G$ is a sequence of edges $(x_0,x_1), (x_1,x_2), (x_2,x_3), \ldots, (x_{n-1},x_n)$ in $G$, where $n$ is a nonnegative integer, and $x_0=a$ and $x_n=b$, that is, a sequence of edges where the terminal vertex of an edge is the same as the initial vertex in the next edge in the path. This path is denoted by $x_0, x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{n-1}, x_n$ and has length $n$. We view the empty set of edges as a path from $a$ to $a$. Thus, I was wrong about the length of $(a,a)$. It is of length 1 not 0. Moreover, the path denoted by just $x_0$ has length $0$. Since there is no edge of this path we view it from $a$ to $a$. It follows that $(a,a) \in R^*$ no matter whether $(a,a) \in R$ which satisfies the definition of reflexive transitive closure .",,"['elementary-set-theory', 'discrete-mathematics']"

Let $n$ be natural numbers. Prove that $2^{n^2}\geq n^n$ . Here is my attempt: First, we define that $P(n):= 2^{n^2} \geq n^n$ . Base Case : $P(1):2^{1^2} =2^1\geq 1^1=1$ Therefore, $P(1)$ is true. Inductive Step : Suppose that $P(k):2^{k^2} \geq k^k$ is true for natural number $k.$ We are going to show that $P(k+1)$ is also true by induction hypothesis. Starting from the left side, we have $$2^{(k+1)^2}=2^{k^2+2k+1}=2^{k^2}\cdot 2^{2k}\cdot 2^1$$ Now, we know that from the induction hypothesis, $2^{k^2}\geq k^k$ , so we have $$2^{k^2}\cdot 2^{2k}\cdot 2^1 \geq k^k \cdot 2^{2k}\cdot 2^1$$ Now, we want to show that $k^k \cdot 2^{2k}\cdot 2^1\geq (k+1)^{k+1}$ . We can rewrite $(k+1)^{k+1}$ as $(k+1)^k \cdot (k+1)$ , and by the binomial expansion, we have $$(k+1)^k = k^k + \binom{k}{1} k^{k-1} + \binom{k}{2} k^{k-2} + \ldots + \binom{k}{k-1} k + 1$$ Now, notice that $\binom{k}{1} k^{k-1} \leq k^k$ because $\binom{k}{1} = k$ , and for all positive integers $k$ , it is obvious that $k^{k-1} \leq k^k$ . Similarly, $$\binom{k}{2} k^{k-2} = \frac{k^k-k^{k-1}}{2} \leq k^k$$ $$\binom{k}{3} k^{k-3} = \frac{k^k-3k^{k-1}+2k^{k-2}}{6} \leq k^k$$ $$\vdots$$ $$\binom{k}{k-1} k = k^2 \leq k^k$$ $$\binom{k}{k} 1 = 1 \leq k^k$$ So, we can rewrite $(k+1)^k$ as $(k+1)^k = k^k + \text{some terms that are less than or equal to } k^k$ . The problem arise when we form an inequality $$(k+1)^k \leq k^k + k\cdot k^k = k^k + k^{k+1}$$ Now, multiplying both sides of this inequality by $k+1$ we get $$(k+1)^k \cdot (k+1) \leq (k^k + k^{k+1}) \cdot (k+1) = k^k \cdot (k+1)^2$$ I want to show that $(k+1)^{k+1} \leq 2^{(k+1)^2}$ , but I don't know if it is okay to do this : I know that $n^2 \leq 2^n$ for natural number $n\geq 4$ which is also can be proven by induction. Therefore, I can say that $(k+1)^2 \leq 2^{k+1}$ for natural number $k\geq 4$ . Thus I have $$ k^k \cdot 2^{k+1}\geq k^k \cdot (k+1)^2 \geq (k+1)^{k+1}.$$ Therefore, $$2^{(k+1)^2} = 2^{k^2} \cdot 2^{k+1} \geq k^k \cdot 2^{k+1}\geq k^k \cdot (k+1)^2 \geq (k+1)^{k+1} $$ $\therefore$ $P(k+1)$ is true.
