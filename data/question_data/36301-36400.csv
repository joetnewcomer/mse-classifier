0,Fisher information for a single sampling of an exponential distribution,Fisher information for a single sampling of an exponential distribution,,"I am viewing an example of finding the Fisher information for a single sampling from an exponential distribution where: $$P(x|\theta) = \frac{1}{\theta}e^{-\frac{x}{\theta}}$$ The score $S$ is $S(x|\theta) = \frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}logP(x|\theta) = -\frac{1}{\theta} + \frac{x}{\theta^2}$. Fisher information is the expectency of $S^2$ which is: $$E_x[S^2] = E_x\left[\frac{1}{\theta^2} - 2\frac{x}{\theta^3} + \frac{x^2}{\theta^4}\right]$$ I know this might sound strange, but I don't know how to calculate this expectation. Something is mixed for me here. I know that $$E[P(x)]=\int xp(x)dx$$ But I can't connect the two pieces of information. In the book, they got: $$E_x[S^2] = E_x\left[\frac{1}{\theta^2} - 2\frac{x}{\theta^3} + \frac{x}{\theta^4}] = \frac{1}{\theta^2} - 2\frac{\theta}{\theta^3} + \frac{2\theta^2}{\theta^4}\right] = \frac{1}{\theta^2}$$ But I can't see how they got that.

3,Equal probabilities in each count in stars and bars,Equal probabilities in each count in stars and bars,,"Stars and bars is a common technique used in combinatorics. It asserts that the number of ways to put $n$ indistinguishable balls into $k$ distinguishable bins is given by: $$ n + k - 1 \choose k - 1 $$ I've seen this count used frequently to calculate probabilities but after some thought, I am slightly skeptical as to whether or not each of the counts given by the stars and bars has a equal probability of occurring. Lets consider the case with 3 balls and 2 bins. I will represent different arrangements of balls with $(n_1, n_2)$ being the case where there are $n_1$ balls in bin 1 and $n_2$ balls in bin 2. Naturally, we have $0 \leq n_1, n_2 \leq 3$ and $n_1 + n_2 = 3$. We can compute the probability of $P(0,3)$, $P(1,2)$, $P(2,1)$, and $P(3,0)$ as follows. Label each of the balls so that there are $2^3 = 8$ different equally likely arrangements. Of these arrangements, there is only $1$ way to put $0$ balls in bin 1. There are $3$ ways to $1$ ball into bin 2, and the other two cases are symmetrical.  Hence: $$P(0,3) = 1/8 \qquad P(1,2) = 3/8$$ This shows that the different items counted in stars and bars do not occur with equal probability. If someone would be so kinda, could you confirm this work? I believe that I have seen the usage of stars and bars to count the number of possibilities for use in the denominator of probability problems.

4,Most likely number of matching cards when two people select different numbers of cards from their own packs,Most likely number of matching cards when two people select different numbers of cards from their own packs,,"Two people R and T each have a standard deck of playing cards and each randomly chooses  as many cards as they like  from their packs. We know that each pack has N=52  different cards and that (say) R chose 10 cards and T 30 but we do not know what specific cards they chose. How do we now calculate the probability (p(M))  of  8 of the cards chosen by R and T being the same (e.g. both chose 6 of clubs, etc.)? or of 5 cards being the same? What we really want to know is the most likely number of chance matches in this scenario.  What is M with the greatest p(M)? Btw we are not interested in the order of picking cards here: R and T need not draw the same card at the same time in order of picking as each other for it to be a match. Hence I take it that this is a problem of combinations and since there is no replacement, hypergeometric? Indeed some of the required probabilities seem to be obtainable with the well known formula below, calculating combinations C where one can select different values of M to get p(M) for each value. This works  where R=T, i.e. both people pick the same number of cards, like in lottery analogies where the lottery chooses 6 numbers and people also pick 6 numbers (usually called K in these formulae): (KCM x ((N-K)C(K-M))) / NCK But what I need is a formula that also works where K is not the same for the two people.

Looking at formulae I have found involving extra bonus balls or people buying more than one ticket, they don't seem to quite fit my case.

23,Probability a blackjack dealer will bust if you know their score and know the exact deck?,Probability a blackjack dealer will bust if you know their score and know the exact deck?,,"If you know the exact cards left in a deck, and the score of the dealer, how can you calculate the exact probability that they will bust? The dealer behaves as follows: If the dealer's score is less than 16, the dealer will ""hit"" and take another card. If the dealer has over 17 (even a ""soft"" score of 17 or greater with an ace and another 6 points from the other cards) the dealer will stay. And just for clarification, in the game of blackjack an Ace can count either as 11 points or 1 point, so if the score with 11 points is still under 21, it is called a ""soft"" hand, meaning if the next card would put you over 21, the ace can be counted as 1 point instead. I am able to calculate the probability of busting on the first hit as follows: $$ P(\text{busts on hit } | \text{ current score, deck}) = {(\text{# cards in deck where card + score} \gt 21) \over \text{total cards in deck}} $$ The issue I am running into is the recursive part, where the dealer must continue to hit if their score is less than 16. For instance, if the dealer has a score of 13 to start, they could hit and receive an ace, a 2 or a 3 and they would have to hit again. So the total probability of busting on the first or second hit would be something like: $$ P(\text{busts on first or second hit } | \text { current score, deck}) \\= P(\text{busting on first hit}) + P(\text{less than 16 on first hit and busting on second}) \\ = {(\text{# cards in deck where card + score} \gt 21) \over \text{total cards in deck}} \\ + \sum\limits_x P(\text{getting score of x on hit}) \times P(\text{busting on next hit with score of x}) $$ The problem seems to get even hairier when you consider that the dealer might receive several cards and still have less than 16, albeit with a low probability for most deck compositions.

Instead we're looking for a constant mathematical method that will work most of the time (i.e., where the percentage of success is the highest possible), and that will also not break any laws (we can't apply a method where we speed up and hope it changes, we have to account for the possibility of having to stop if it doesn't on time).

My first idea was to use $(4)$ to see that $$L\le\limsup_{n\to\infty}\left|(1+2\varepsilon)\overline{X}^{(k_{n+1})}-E\left[\frac{1}{1+2\varepsilon}\overline{X}^{(k_n)}\right]\right|\tag{6}$$However, I am not able to take advantage of $(3)$ in $(6)$.",,"['real-analysis', 'probability', 'measure-theory', 'probability-theory']"

61,Optimal Strategy Game of Communicating without Overlap,Optimal Strategy Game of Communicating without Overlap,,"Today, I had a conversation which proceeded very poorly; indeed, I had this conversation with $n$ people, including myself, and everyone had something to say. Problem was that, for an unreasonably long time, it was always two or more people trying to speak at once - and everything was indecipherable. Then, people backed off and there were periods when no one was talking - only to trigger a few people to try to jump into the conversation, and overlap again! Eventually , by pure chance, one person got to talking alone (and never had to talk again), and, slowly but surely, everyone got their turn to speak. Now, being the mathematician that I am, I figured, hey, I can solve this problem. I want to give all $n$ people a sheet of paper describing the rules of conversation - a simple solution would be to assign each a time to speak, but that's not fair to the people who have to wait. So, I want to give all $n$ people the same set of rules to follow. I assume I recognize that, this means, at the first opportunity to speak, everyone will speak with equal probability, and it seems likely that there will be overlap - but then the strategies can differentiate based on the results of that first opportunity (though these people are poor listeners; from each opportunity, they only know whether they tried to speak, and whether there were multiple people, a single person, or no one speaking). To be very formal, define the problem as follows: A conversation is a series of discrete opportunities to talk, at which each player may choose either to attempt to talk, or to be silent. Anyone who successfully talks without interruption will not attempt to speak again. The conversation ends when everyone has spoken. The history of a conversation, will be a finite sequence of the three possible outcomes of an opportunity (no one talks, one person talks, many people talk) - it does not distinguish between $2$ and $3$ people talking. A strategy is a map taking the history of a conversation, and determining whether a given player will talk.  A mixed strategy is a probability distribution over of the set of possibly strategies, and represents, essentially, a non-deterministic strategy. And my question is thus: For what mixed strategy is the expected length of the conversation (measured in opportunities missed) minimized when $n$ people play the strategy against itself? What I know so far are the following strategies: $n=1$: The person should talk at the first opportunity. The conversation will have length $1$ and will be very lonely. $n=2$: The people should maximize the probability that exactly one of them talks at each turn - and, if they both choose to talk or both not to, they gain no useful information about the other, and hence should continue with the same strategy. Thus, the best strategy is to talk with probability $\frac{1}2$ until one of them is successful, after which the other one speaks, yielding an expected length of $3$. $n=3$: This one is trickier and I don't have a proof. I'm fairly certain that the following strategy is locally optimal, and I suspect that it is the best, but I'm not sure. We use three states for which a person can be in - everyone starts in state A: (State A) Speak with probability $p$ at the next opportunity. If no one speaks, remain in state A. If one person speaks, transition to the two person game. If many people, including yourself, speak, go to state B. If many people, not including yourself speak (implying the two others spoke), go to state C. (State B) Don't speak at the next opportunity, then transition to state A if no one speaks. If one person speaks, transition to the two state game. (No more than one person will ever speak in this state) (State C) Speak at the next opportunity; you are guaranteed to be successful. The idea here is that we either escape the dilemma when one person speaks out of the three, or when two people do (and then the other person talks while the two who overlapped are in state B, silent). Using that the expected length of a conversation for two people is $3$, we can find the expected length $\ell$ of this conversation as $$\ell = p^3\cdot(2+\ell)+3p^2(1-p)\cdot (2+3)+3p(1-p)^2\cdot (1+3)+(1-p)^3\cdot(1+\ell)$$ which yields the minimum, according to Mathematica $$p=\frac{1}{4} \left(2-\sqrt{6}+\sqrt{4 \sqrt{6}-6}\right)\approx .37$$ $$\ell=\frac{1}{6} \left(21+\sqrt{9+24 \sqrt{6}}\right)\approx 4.87.$$ Given that the problem of characterizing the optimal strategy for arbitrary $n$ may be extremely difficult, I would not expect answers to find one (but, if you find one, or have something you suspect to be optimal, I'd love to see it)- indeed, even the case of $n=4$ is interesting to me, since I have no handle on what the strategy might be. (The account given in this post is purely fictional; any resemblance to real conversations is purely coincidental)","Today, I had a conversation which proceeded very poorly; indeed, I had this conversation with $n$ people, including myself, and everyone had something to say.

To be very formal, define the problem as follows: A conversation is a series of discrete opportunities to talk, at which each player may choose either to attempt to talk, or to be silent. Anyone who successfully talks without interruption will not attempt to speak again. The conversation ends when everyone has spoken. The history of a conversation, will be a finite sequence of the three possible outcomes of an opportunity (no one talks, one person talks, many people talk) - it does not distinguish between $2$ and $3$ people talking. A strategy is a map taking the history of a conversation, and determining whether a given player will talk.  A mixed strategy is a probability distribution over of the set of possibly strategies, and represents, essentially, a non-deterministic strategy. And my question is thus: For what mixed strategy is the expected length of the conversation (measured in opportunities missed) minimized when $n$ people play the strategy against itself? What I know so far are the following strategies: $n=1$: The person should talk at the first opportunity. The conversation will have length $1$ and will be very lonely. $n=2$: The people should maximize the probability that exactly one of them talks at each turn - and, if they both choose to talk or both not to, they gain no useful information about the other, and hence should continue with the same strategy. Thus, the best strategy is to talk with probability $\frac{1}2$ until one of them is successful, after which the other one speaks, yielding an expected length of $3$. $n=3$: This one is trickier and I don't have a proof. I'm fairly certain that the following strategy is locally optimal, and I suspect that it is the best, but I'm not sure. We use three states for which a person can be in - everyone starts in state A: (State A) Speak with probability $p$ at the next opportunity. If no one speaks, remain in state A. If one person speaks, transition to the two person game. If many people, including yourself, speak, go to state B. If many people, not including yourself speak (implying the two others spoke), go to state C. (State B) Don't speak at the next opportunity, then transition to state A if no one speaks. If one person speaks, transition to the two state game. (No more than one person will ever speak in this state) (State C) Speak at the next opportunity; you are guaranteed to be successful. The idea here is that we either escape the dilemma when one person speaks out of the three, or when two people do (and then the other person talks while the two who overlapped are in state B, silent). Using that the expected length of a conversation for two people is $3$, we can find the expected length $\ell$ of this conversation as $$\ell = p^3\cdot(2+\ell)+3p^2(1-p)\cdot (2+3)+3p(1-p)^2\cdot (1+3)+(1-p)^3\cdot(1+\ell)$$ which yields the minimum, according to Mathematica $$p=\frac{1}{4} \left(2-\sqrt{6}+\sqrt{4 \sqrt{6}-6}\right)\approx .37$$ $$\ell=\frac{1}{6} \left(21+\sqrt{9+24 \sqrt{6}}\right)\approx 4.87.$$ Given that the problem of characterizing the optimal strategy for arbitrary $n$ may be extremely difficult, I would not expect answers to find one (but, if you find one, or have something you suspect to be optimal, I'd love to see it)- indeed, even the case of $n=4$ is interesting to me, since I have no handle on what the strategy might be.

The worst shooter has the best chance of surviving in the triangular duel, which is Jones. After him goes Smith who never misses the target. Since Smith and Brown will be shooting each other when their turn comes, Jones must shoot no one until one of his enemies dies. After that he shoots at his enemy, again having an advantage. First, it's easier to calculate the probability of surviving for Smith. In the duel with Brown he shoots first with a probability of 1/2. In this case he kills Brown. Brown also shoots first with a probability of 1/2. Smith survives with a probability of 1/5. Thus, Smith will live over Brown with a probability of 1/2 + 1/2 * 1/5 = 3/5 .

We calculate the expected value of $Y$:  $$  \mathbb{E}(Y) = \sum_{i<j}\mathbb{E}(X_{ij}) = {n\choose{2}}\mathbb{E}(X_{12}) =   \frac{7}{12}{n\choose{2}}. $$ Now, let's determine the variance of $Y$: $$ \mathrm{var}(Y) = \mathbb{E}(Y^2) - \mathbb{E}(Y)^2  = \mathbb{E} \left\{ \left( \sum_{i<j}X_{ij} \right)^2 \right\} - \mathbb{E}(Y)^2 = \mathbb{E} \left( \sum_{i<j,\space k<l}X_{ij}X_{kl} \right) - \mathbb{E}(Y)^2 . $$ Further, we look closer at the sum  $\sum_{i<j,\space k<l}X_{ij}X_{kl}$. Here $X_{ij}$ and $X_{kl}$ are independent whenever $i\neq k$, $i\neq l$, $j\neq k$ and $j\neq l$. When both $i = k$ and $j = l$ we get the random variables $\{X_{ij}^2\}_{i<j}$, each having expected value  $$ \mathbb{E}(X_{ij}^2) = \mathbb{E}(X_{12}^2) = \sum_{m=1}^6\frac{m^2}{36}=\frac{91}{36}. $$  When only three of the four inequalities above hold we get a random variable on one of the following forms: $X_{ij}X_{jl}$, $X_{ij}X_{il}$, $X_{ij}X_{ki}$ or $X_{ij}X_{kj}$. These have expected value  $$ \mathbb{E}(X_{ij}X_{il}) = \mathbb{E}(X_{12}X_{13})  = \sum_{m=1}^6\frac{m^2}{216}=\frac{91}{216}. $$ We note that each triple $\{a,b,c\}$, such that $1\leq a < b < c \leq n$, is associated to the following six terms $X_{ab}X_{ac}$, $X_{ac}X_{ab}$, $X_{ab}X_{bc}$, $X_{bc}X_{ab}$, $X_{ac}X_{bc}$, $X_{bc}X_{ac}$, all with the above expected value. Clearly there are ${n\choose{3}}$ such triples. This gives us the following: $$ \mathrm{var}(Y) =  \mathbb{E} \left( \sum_{i<j,\space k<l}X_{ij}X_{kl} \right) - \mathbb{E}(Y)^2 $$ $$ = {n\choose{2}}\mathbb{E}(X_{12}^2) +  6{n\choose{3}}\mathbb{E}(X_{12}X_{13})+ \left\{{n\choose{2}}^2 - {n\choose{2}} - 6{n\choose{3}} \right\}\mathbb{E}(X_{12})^2 - \left\{{n\choose{2}}\mathbb{E}(X_{12})\right\}^2  $$ $$ = \frac{35}{16}{n\choose{2}} + \frac{35}{72}{n\choose{3}} $$ The book of solutions gives the answer $\frac{35}{16}{n\choose{2}} + \frac{35}{432}{n\choose{3}}$ though, which is what I would get if each triple $\{a,b,c\}$ only was associated with one term $X_{ab}X_{bc}$.

85,Maximum-Value Secretary Problem,Maximum-Value Secretary Problem,,"Background: The classic secretary problem has the simple solution of rejecting the first 1/e applicants and then selecting anyone who was better than the best in the rejected set.  However, in the real world secretaries are not of value 0 if they are not the best, and so choosing the 2nd best is normally far better than choosing the worst.  Also, if you stick to the classical approach, there's a 1/e chance that you will receive a random secretary from the set that excludes the best secretary. Real-World Example: Say that you've interviewed 98 out of 100 secretaries and have not found any better than secretary #32.  You then interview the 99th secretary and find that she is second only to #32. Analysis: Under the classical problem, you'd reject #99 as they have a value of 0 (not the best).  Thus, you'd take a random secretary in favor of the 98th or 99th best, depending on whether the last secretary is the best or not. However, the classical solution would not be the best decision in nearly all real-world cases, as you are taking a random applicant instead of one better than at least 97/99 others. Question: What is the proper stopping strategy to maximize the expected-value of the secretary you hire? You have n secretaries. Each secretary has a linear value assigned after each interview (a secretary ranked 4 is assumed to be twice as valuable as one ranked 2). The value-distribution of secretaries is unknown. You must accept or reject each secretary immediately following their interview with no recalls. You must maximize the expected value of the secretary you hire.","Background: The classic secretary problem has the simple solution of rejecting the first 1/e applicants and then selecting anyone who was better than the best in the rejected set.  However, in the real world secretaries are not of value 0 if they are not the best, and so choosing the 2nd best is normally far better than choosing the worst.  Also, if you stick to the classical approach, there's a 1/e chance that you will receive a random secretary from the set that excludes the best secretary. Real-World Example: Say that you've interviewed 98 out of 100 secretaries and have not found any better than secretary #32.  You then interview the 99th secretary and find that she is second only to #32. Analysis: Under the classical problem, you'd reject #99 as they have a value of 0 (not the best).  Thus, you'd take a random secretary in favor of the 98th or 99th best, depending on whether the last secretary is the best or not. However, the classical solution would not be the best decision in nearly all real-world cases, as you are taking a random applicant instead of one better than at least 97/99 others. Question: What is the proper stopping strategy to maximize the expected-value of the secretary you hire? You have n secretaries. Each secretary has a linear value assigned after each interview (a secretary ranked 4 is assumed to be twice as valuable as one ranked 2). The value-distribution of secretaries is unknown. You must accept or reject each secretary immediately following their interview with no recalls. You must maximize the expected value of the secretary you hire.",,"['probability', 'decision-theory']"

I believe I understand the general concepts OK, however when I come to look at some sample questions to test my understanding, I feel a little lost! I must stress that this is not homework, or any other assessed work - purely for my own understanding, as statistic isn't an area I have studied in great detail to he truthful. For instance, one question I would like to get my head around is: $X \sim B(n,p)$ and $P=bX$. Assuming $n$ is known, determine $b$ such that $P$ is an unbiased estimator of $p$ and find its standard error. To start with, I have found the following: $E(P)=E(bX)=bE(X)=bnp$ - therefore, am I right in thinking that for P to be an inbiased estimator, we must have b equal to $1/n$? For the second part, I believe that I require the variance, as follows: $V(P)=V(bX)=b^2V(X)=b^2 np(1-p)$, and so where $b=1/n$ we have: $V(P)=\frac{p(1-p)}{n}$ and so the standard error will be: Standard Error $=\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$. Does this solution look correct - I feel that it is, however would like to check my understanding. Thanks in advance for any help! Best, Chris","I'm having some difficulty with unbiased estimators, and wondered if anyone could help me.

For each section, you can paint it with one color out of four: Red, Yellow, Blue, Green. The rule is adjacent sections can't have the same color. Find the Recurrence Relation of $S_n$ (possible ways to paint the disk for $n$ sections). Here is what I am thinking so far: Case $1$ : $S_1=4$  since for the whole disk, we can pick $4$ possible colors to paint it. Case $2$ : $S_2=4 \times 3=12$  There are $4$ colors to choose for the first section, $3$ remaining for the second. Case $3$ : $S_2=4 \times 3 \times 2=24$ (Since for the first section, we can pick $4$ colors, the second has $3$ possible choices. The third only have $2$ since it can't be the same with both the first one and the second one. Case $4$ : For $4$ sections, similarly, the first section have $4$ choices. The second section have $3$ choices. The third section have $3$ choices. For the last section, there is uncertainty. If the first and third section have the same color. Then it has $3$ choices. Else, it just have $2$ choice. So I don't know how many possible choices would be there. For now, my strategy is to find cases from $1$ to $5$ or $6$. Then I will figure out the recurrence relation numerically... But I know it's not the right way to go. This should not be a hard problem and I'd appreciate your help!","There is a disk, separated into n sections, as indicated in the graph.
