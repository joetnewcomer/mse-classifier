2,Linear combinations of sine and cosine,Linear combinations of sine and cosine,,"If you take a linear combination of the cosine and sine function, then the result is again a sinusoid , but with a new amplitude and phase shift. $$a \cos(\theta) + b \sin(\theta) = A \cos(\theta + \theta_0)$$ This is one of those facts which I've always felt should be more obvious to me than it is. I can't help feeling that I might be missing out on some good ""conceptual reason"" for this to be true. I did a bit of thinking about it today and I came up with the following explanation which I'm not particularly satisfied with. I feel like there should be some perspective on this which renders the fact obvious. Multiplying the polar equation $r = 2a \cos(\theta) + 2b \sin(\theta)$ by $r$ yields $x^2+y^2 = 2a x + 2by$. Rearranging terms and adding $a^2 + b^2$ to both sides gives $x^2 - 2ax + a^2 +y^2 -2by + b^2 = a^2 + b^2$ which is identical to   $$(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = a^2 + b^2$$   which we recognize as the equation for the circle with centre at $(a,b)$ and passing through the origin. This hints that $r = 2a \cos(\theta) + 2b \sin(\theta)$ should define a parametrization of this circle and, indeed, this holds. This circle can be rotated about the origin so as to have its centre on the $x$-axis. Such a circle will have the simpler equation   $$r = D \cos(\theta) $$   where $D=2(a^2+b^2)$ is the diameter of the circle. In polar coordinates, performing this rotation amounts to introducing a phase $\theta_0$. In fact $\theta_0$ is an argument for the point $(a,b)$.

4,Defining the equation of an ellipse in the complex plane,Defining the equation of an ellipse in the complex plane,,"Usually the equation for an ellipse in the complex plane is defined as $\lvert z-a\rvert + \lvert z-b\rvert = c$ where $c>\lvert a-b\rvert$. If we start with a real ellipse, can we define it in the manner below? For $x,y,h,k,a,b\in\mathbb{R}$ such that $a,b\neq 0$, we define a real ellipse as $$   \frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} + \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1. $$ Let $z = \frac{x}{a} + i\frac{y}{b}$ and $z_0 = \frac{h}{a} + i\frac{k}{b}$. If we expand the equation for an ellipse, we have $$   \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} + \frac{h^2}{a^2} + \frac{k^2}{b^2} -   \frac{2xh}{a^2} - \frac{2yk}{b^2} = 1. $$ Notice that $\lvert z\rvert^2 = \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2}$ and $\lvert z_0\rvert^2 = \frac{h^2}{a^2} + \frac{k^2}{b^2}$.

43,"Why does a convex polyhedron being vertex-, edge-, and face-transitive imply that it is a Platonic solid?","Why does a convex polyhedron being vertex-, edge-, and face-transitive imply that it is a Platonic solid?",,"Suppose that we have a convex polyhedron $P$ , such that the symmetry group of $P$ acts transitively on its vertices, edges, and faces (that is, it is isogonal, isotoxal, and isohedral). It then follows that $P$ is one of the Platonic solids , which have a number of equivalent definitions but usually includes some stipulation that the faces are regular. (Once you have regular faces plus these symmetry conditions, most other properties follow easily.) This can be shown via a rather gross casework argument on the number of sides at each face. By face-transitivity, all faces are congruent (in fact, we only need that the polyhedron be monohedral for this). By edge-transitivity, said faces are equilateral polygons. Then we break into cases by the number of sides of the polygons: If the faces are triangles, being equilateral implies being regular. If the faces are non-regular equilateral quadrilaterals, they are rhombi. Then, at every vertex there must be an equal number of ""skinny"" and ""wide"" angles meeting, and there must be at least 3 faces meeting at a vertex. But then there are at least two skinny and two wide angles (since we assume the angles are different), so the angles at each vertex add up to at least 360 degrees, which is not possible in a convex polyhedron. If the faces are non-regular equilateral pentagons, then they have angles which are not all the same; however, each vertex must have the same angles around it, so each vertex has a proportional fraction of the angles of the pentagons. But for any distribution other than the uniform one, the only way to have a proportional amount of every angle is to have some $n$ copies of every angle with multiplicity, since $5$ is prime. (E.g. if there are $2$ angles of one size and $3$ of another, we can't get a $2:3$ ratio without having at least $5$ angles at every vertex.) But the angles of a pentagon add to more than $360^\circ$ , so we can't have them all at once. If the faces are hexagons or higher, they cannot form a topological sphere by Euler's formula. However, I don't like this proof very much; I walk away from it with no understanding of why this behavior occurs, and it certainly doesn't suggest any generalizations to other dimensions (where I believe the analogous statement - that transitivity on every degree of cell in a convex polytope implies regularity - is true, though I would appreciate a reference for this fact). Is there a natural or more elegant proof of this statement? One thing to note is that any proof must somehow use the fact that we are working on the sphere. In the case of planar tilings, the corresponding implication is false: being transitive on faces, vertices, and edges does not imply that one is looking at a tiling of regular polygons! As a counterexample, consider a rhombic tiling like this one: As another aside, relaxing any one of these conditions allows for polyhedra whose faces are not congruent regular polygons: the rhombic dodecahedron is face-transitive and edge-transitive, an isosceles tetrahedron is face-transitive and vertex-transitive, and the cuboctahedron is edge-transitive and vertex-transitive.","Suppose that we have a convex polyhedron , such that the symmetry group of acts transitively on its vertices, edges, and faces (that is, it is isogonal, isotoxal, and isohedral).

49,How wide can a unit-length planar curve be?,How wide can a unit-length planar curve be?,,"The width of a bounded set in the plane is the minimum distance between two parallel lines bounding the set. Suppose that we have some curve $C: [0,1]\to\mathbb{R}^2$ of unit length. How large can its width be? Equivalently, if we would like to bend a wire into a shape of unit width, how much wire do we need? (I'll use the latter framing in this post because it makes the numbers a little nicer.) If one tries forming the wire into a circle or semicircle, $\pi$ units of length are needed. All but one of the sides of a unit square only takes $3$ units. Using $270$ degrees of a circular arc one can do better, with length $\frac{3\pi(2-\sqrt{2})}{2}=2.7604\ldots$ . After playing around with different natural options for a bit, the winner appears to be $\frac{4}{\sqrt{3}}\approx2.3094$ , given by forming the wire into a $60$ -degree angle so that its convex hull is the equilateral triangle of width 1. However, it turns out that this is not optimal! Consider the following construction: Fix $0.5<x<\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ . Start with the triangle formed by the points $(0,1), (-x,0), (x,0)$ . Then, add the circular arcs of radius $1$ from each of the latter two points as they pass through the opposite side of the triangle. Take the convex hull of these three points and two circular arcs, and omit the line segment of length $2x$ at the bottom; the resulting set is our wire. Above is a diagram of this construction: the original triangle is marked in blue, the circular arcs (of which only part make it to the convex hull) are marked in red, the straight-line tangents to said arcs are in black, and the portion of the convex hull not on the wire is marked with a dashed line. It is fairly easy to see that this construction has width $1$ , and that the resulting length is $$2\left(x+\sqrt{4x^2-1}+\arctan(1/x)-\arctan(x)-\arccos(1/2x)\right)$$ As it turns out, this function is minimized around $x=0.521795$ , with a wire length of around $2.2783$ . (In fact, the derivative of the above function is a rational function, so we can be more precise: $x$ is the unique positive real root of the polynomial $3x^6 + 9x^4 + x^2 - 1$ .) Is this construction optimal? I do not believe there are any obvious local improvements one can make, but it's possible that a radically different wire shape could improve on this configuration. Obviously, there is a lower bound of $1$ on the length of any solution, and by considering the width in two orthogonal directions one can increase this to $\sqrt{2}$ . It's tempting to say that the length must be at least $2$ , because there must be a point at distance $1$ from the midpoint of the wire, but this only follows if one makes the assumption that the wire lies on the boundary of its convex hull, which I cannot see a good way to justify. I would be curious to see any improved lower bounds, better solutions than the one given above, or pointers to discussion of this question in the literature.","The width of a bounded set in the plane is the minimum distance between two parallel lines bounding the set.

How would you cut the egg white using only a finite amount of straight lines so that each of your $N$ egg sandwiches will have exactly one yolk and the same amount (area) of egg white? It is allowed to let the lines pass trough the yolk, but you do not actually cut it; the yolk circles have to remain intact (until you pop them and let the delicious yolk flow over your sandwich). EDIT: (From a discussion in the comments) The yolks do not actually have to stay connected to the egg white, you can picture the yolks as holes in the white. When the white has been distributed well, the yolks can then be added to each sandwich. EDIT 2: For the sake of clarity, I'd like to add that in my original train of thought, line segments and half lines are also allowed as cuts, not just lines. Just like you would be able to cut in real life. But the line-only case could be interesting, too! Bonus points if you manage to solve it that way :) For $N=2$, I have found out that taking the midpoint $M$ between the centres of the two yolks and cutting along the line that passes trough the centre $C$ of the pan and M cuts the white evenly almost always, although in some cases you have to ""jump over"" the yolks while cutting, but this is okay (see image below). The only exception is $C=M$, but in that case just cut along the perpendicular of the line between the midpoints of the yolks! This is a (rather simple) case-by-case construction and I was wondering if there is a construction that just works as it is, without having to consider cases. I'm looking for a case-free solution (construction) to the general problem, too. Any construction for other specific cases are welcome too! I'm having trouble formulating what tools are exactly ""allowed"" for the construction, so right now I'd say: anything goes, as long as it's nothing trivial like ""take the line that cuts surface A precisely in half"" without specifying how to construct that line. I hope this example gives you an idea of what I'm looking for, or at least what I'm not looking for. On the other hand, anything interesting that can be said regarding this (kind of) problem, perhaps form a more abstract and deep mathematical point of view, is also very appreciated!

Then assuming to deal with a voulume $\Omega \in \mathbb{R}^n$ whose boundary $\partial \Omega$ is regular enough to have a well defined surface area, I reasoned as follow: the indicartor function is used to compute approximatively the surface area by implicitly assuming it to be smooth and calculating its derivative (which are nonvanishing only on the smooth-assumed boundary). This post Smooth approximation of characteristic function of a bounded open set gave me the idea: By seeing the indicator function $\chi_{\Omega}(\vec{x})$ as the limit of the following succession of functions: \begin{equation} 	f_n(\vec{x})=\frac{n^3}{\pi^{\frac{3}{2}}}e^{-(n{\vec{x}})^2} \end{equation} which has integral $1$ and approaches the Dirac delta function as $n\to \infty$.  The convolution $\chi_{\Omega}*f_n$ is smooth  $\forall n$ since $f_n$ is smooth and it converges everywhere to $\chi_{\Omega}$: \begin{equation} 	[\chi_{\Omega}*f_n](\vec{x})=\int_{\mathbb R^3}\chi_{\Omega}(\vec{y})f_n(\vec{x}-\vec{y})d\vec{y} \end{equation} \begin{equation} 	\nabla^k_{\vec{x}}[\chi_{\Omega}*f_n](\vec{x})=\int_{\mathbb R^3}\chi_{\Omega}(\vec{y})\nabla^k_{\vec{x}}f_n(\vec{x}-\vec{y})d\vec{y} \end{equation} Therefore, using this formalism, we can define the implicit equation for the surface as: \begin{equation} 	h_n(\vec{x})=[\chi_{\Omega}*f_n](\vec{x})-0.5 \end{equation} \begin{equation}  \chi_{\Omega}(\vec{x})=\theta(h_n(\vec{x})) \tag{**}\label{**} \end{equation} Given a 3D surface defined implicitly by $h_n(x,y,z)=0$ the normal versor to it is defined by: \begin{equation} 	\hat{N}_n=\frac{\nabla h_n}{||\nabla h_n||} \end{equation} For finite $n$, the vector field $\hat{N}_n$ defined here is continuous and differentiable, hence we can apply the divergence theorem using $\hat{N}_n$ as a vector field: \begin{equation} 	\iiint_V( \nabla\cdot\hat{N_n}) \;\text{d}\tau=\iint_{\partial V} (\hat{N_n}\cdot\hat{N_n})\;\text{dS}=\iint_{\partial V} \text{dS}= A \tag{***}\label{***} \end{equation} Therefore we are able to compute the surface area integrating over the volume the divergence of the vector field defined by the normal to the surface. The vector field $\hat{N}_n$ defined here is continuous and differentiable in the region around the border of V for finite $n$, but as $n\to\infty$ it becomes ill defined Therefore, up to now I think that my method allows to have an approximate estimation of the area of the surface for $n$ finite, but in the limir $n\to\infty$ we have that the vector field $\hat{N}_n$ becomes ill defined and so I cannot say anything about the convergence of the area to the real value...

63,Geometry Proof: Convex Quadrilateral,Geometry Proof: Convex Quadrilateral,,"A quadrilateral $ABCD$ is formed from four distinct points (called the vertices), no three of which are collinear, and from the segments $AB$ , $CB$ , $CD$ , and $DA$ (called the sides), which have no intersections except at those endpoints labeled by the same letter. The notation for this quadrilateral is not unique- e.g., quadrilateral $ABCD$ = quadrilateral $CBAD$ . Two vertices that are endpoints of a side are called adjacent; otherwise the two vertices are called opposite. The remaining pair of segments $AC$ and $BD$ formed from the four points are called diagonals of the quadrilateral; they may or may not intersect at some fifth point. If $X$ , $Y$ , $Z$ are the vertices of quadrilateral $ABCD$ such that $Y$ is adjacent to both $X$ and $Z$ , then angle $XYZ$ is called an angle of the quadrilateral; if $W$ is the fourth vertex, then angle $XWZ$ and angle $XYZ$ are called opposite angles. The quadrilaterals of main interest are the convex ones. By definition, they are the quadrilaterals such that each pair of opposite sides, e.g., $AB$ and $CD$ , has the property that $CD$ is contained in one of the half-planes bounded by the line through $A$ and $B$ , and $AB$ is contained in one of the half-planes bounded by the line through $C$ and $D$ . a) Using Pasch's theorem, prove that if one pair of opposite sides has this property, then so does the other pair of opposite sides. b) Prove, using the crossbar theorem, that the following are equivalent: The quadrilateral is convex. Each vertex of the quadrilateral lies in the interior of the opposite angle. The diagonals of the quadrilateral meet. I can’t seem to make sense of a) at all. For b) I approached it in this way - I made three separate proofs: If the quadrilateral is convex, then the diagonals of the quadrilateral meet. Proof: Assume quadrilateral $ABCD$ is a convex quadrilateral. We have to prove that segment $AC$ and segment $BD$ have a point in common. By the     definition of a convex quadrilateral, $C$ is in the interior of angle $DAB$ . Hence, ray $AC$ intersects segment $BD$ at some point $E$ (by the     crossbar theorem). Therefore, $E$ is the required intersection point     of the diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ . If the diagonals of the quadrilateral meet, then each vertex of the quadrilateral lies in the interior of the opposite angle. Proof: If each vertex of the quadrilateral lies in the interior of the opposite angle, then the quadrilateral is convex. Proof: I’m also confused over the proofs for 2. And 3.. Theorems and axioms that might be helpful: Pasch’s Theorem : If $A$ , $B$ , and $C$ are distinct points and $l$ is any line intersecting $AB$ in a point between $A$ and $B$ , then $l$ also intersects either $AC$ , or $BC$ . If $C$ does not lie on $l$ , then $l$ does not intersect both $AC$ and $BC$ . Interior an angle : Given an angle $\angle CAB$ , deﬁne a point $D$ to be in the interior of $\angle CAB$ if $D$ is on the same side of Ray $AC$ as $B$ and if $D$ is also on the same side of Ray $AB$ as $C$ . Thus, the interior of an angle is the intersection of two half-planes. Crossbar Theorem : If ray $AD$ is between ray $AC$ and ray $AB$ , then ray $AD$ intersects segment $BC$ .

By definition, they are the quadrilaterals such that each pair of opposite sides, e.g., and , has the property that is contained in one of the half-planes bounded by the line through and , and is contained in one of the half-planes bounded by the line through and . a) Using Pasch's theorem, prove that if one pair of opposite sides has this property, then so does the other pair of opposite sides. b) Prove, using the crossbar theorem, that the following are equivalent: The quadrilateral is convex. Each vertex of the quadrilateral lies in the interior of the opposite angle. The diagonals of the quadrilateral meet. I can’t seem to make sense of a) at all. For b) I approached it in this way - I made three separate proofs: If the quadrilateral is convex, then the diagonals of the quadrilateral meet. Proof: Assume quadrilateral is a convex quadrilateral. We have to prove that segment and segment have a point in common. By the     definition of a convex quadrilateral, is in the interior of angle . Hence, ray intersects segment at some point (by the     crossbar theorem). Therefore, is the required intersection point     of the diagonals and . If the diagonals of the quadrilateral meet, then each vertex of the quadrilateral lies in the interior of the opposite angle. Proof: If each vertex of the quadrilateral lies in the interior of the opposite angle, then the quadrilateral is convex. Proof: I’m also confused over the proofs for 2. And 3.. Theorems and axioms that might be helpful: Pasch’s Theorem : If , , and are distinct points and is any line intersecting in a point between and , then also intersects either , or . If does not lie on , then does not intersect both and . Interior an angle : Given an angle , deﬁne a point to be in the interior of if is on the same side of Ray as and if is also on the same side of Ray as . Thus, the interior of an angle is the intersection of two half-planes. Crossbar Theorem : If ray is between ray and ray , then ray intersects segment .

I want to stitch the cloth together so that it can contain stuff (say, lots of small beans) and the stuff cannot escape. What is the maximum volume that the cloth can contain? I guess the optimal shape will be made by folding the cloth in half into a double-layered semicircle, then stitching along the arc (sort of like a dumpling, but with an infinitesimally narrow sealed strip). I suppose we could physically make such a shape, stuff it with small beans, then pour the beans into another container that can measure volume. But is there a mathematical way to answer this question? A crude upper bound for the maximum volume can be obtained by (erroneously) assuming that the cloth can be shaped into a sphere without wasting any of the cloth. Then the radius of the sphere, $r$ , would satisfy $4\pi r^2=\pi$ , so the volume of the sphere, i.e. the crude upper bound, would be $\pi/6\approx0.524$ .

The orthogonal projections of the vectors from $\Lambda_1\cap B(N_1/2)$ on to the line $\perp\vec{v}_2$ have lengths $\le N_1/2$. As there are $O(N_1^2)$ points in $\Lambda_1\cap B(N_1/2)$, some of those projections are within $O(1/N_1)$ of each other. Let $\vec{v}_1$ be the difference vector.

95,A question of H.G. Wells' mathematics,A question of H.G. Wells' mathematics,,"H.G Wells' short story The Plattner Story is about a man who somehow ends up being ""inverted"" from left to right. So his heart has moved from left to right, his brain, and any other asymmetries belonging to him. Then H.G Wells' goes on a slight metaphysical exposition: There is no way of taking a man and moving him about in space, as ordinary people understand space, that will result in our changing his sides. Whatever you do, his right is still his right, his left his left. You can do that with a perfectly thin and flat thing, of course. If you were to cut a figure out of paper, any figure with a right and left side, you could change its sides by simply lifting and turning it over. But with a solid it is different. Mathematical theorists tell us that the only way in which the right and left sides of a solid body can be changed is by taking that body clean out of space as we know it, - taking it out of ordinary existence, that is, and turning it somewhere outside space. This is a little abstruse, no doubt, but anyone with a slight knowledge of mathematical theory will assure the reader of its truth. To put the thing in technical language, the curious inversion of Plattner's right and left sides is proof that he has moved out of our space into what is called the Fourth Dimension, and that he has returned again to our world. This is leaving me a bit perplexed. A reflection is an odd isometry after all, and rotations/translations are direct. So it shouldn't be possible for the man to be reflected using continuous,direct transformations, regardless of how many dimensions he is using. But then again, his argument with the 2/3D analogue is convincing...

99,"$\pi$, Dedekind cuts, trigonometric functions, area of a circle",", Dedekind cuts, trigonometric functions, area of a circle",\pi,"(I should say at the outset that this question is broad, and may need splitting up. Although I ask several questions, I present them as one because they are not independent of one another, and I am seeking a unified answer.) My questions  are: How can we establish that the circumference $C$ and area $A$  of a circle of radius $r$ satisfy $C = 2\pi r$ and $A = \pi r^2$ for some constant, $\pi$? How can we prove that $\pi$ is an element of the real field (e.g., a Dedekind cut)? How can we prove (perhaps trivial, if the above are satisfied) that there are real functions $\sin(x)$ and $\cos(x)$, which have the usual analytic properties, and also satisfy the usual geometric intuition? It seems like most calculus textbooks sort of weasel out on these questions. Usually, they ignore the first two questions pretty much completely, and their derivation on the third point is a filling-out of the following outline: (1) Define $\sin(x)$ as height of triangle of central angle $x$ inscribed in the unit circle, where $x$ is in radians, and $\cos(x)$ as the length of its base. Assume the usual values for these functions at $k(\frac{\pi}{2}), k \in \mathbb{N}$. (2) Notice, by assuming (a) that $A = \pi r^2$ and $C = 2\pi r$, and (b) that the area of a sector is proportionate to the length of arc subtended by the angle on the circumference, that the area $S$ of a sector of angle $x$ in a unit circle is $\frac{x}{2}$, since $$\frac{S}{\pi r^2} = \frac{x}{2 \pi r}, r = 1 \implies S = \frac{x}{2}$$ (Apparently, assumption (b) is Euclid VI 33 . I haven't studied the proof, though.) (3) Prove, using a geometric argument, that $\frac{\sin(x)}{2} < \frac{x}{2} < \frac{\tan(x)}{2}$ for $x \in [0,\frac{\pi}{2})$. Deal similarly (not identically) with $(\frac{-\pi}{2}, 0]$. Prove that we always have $1 > \frac{\sin(x)}{x} > \cos(x)$ on $(\frac{-\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2})$. (4) Derive (by a geometric argument, as done here ) the usual angle addition formulas. (5) Noting that $|\sin(x)| < |x|$ (geometrically), conclude that $\lim_{x \to 0} \sin(x) = 0$. Use the identity - derived from (4) - that $$\cos(x) = 1 - 2\sin^2(\frac{x}{2}) = (1 - \sqrt{2}\sin(\frac{x}{2}))(1 + \sqrt{2}\sin(\frac{x}{2}))$$ and the product theorem for limits to conclude that $\lim_{x \to 0} \cos(x) = 1$. (6) Use the ""Squeeze Theorem"" and (3) to prove that $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x} = 1$, $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\cos(x) - 1}{x} = 0$. Use (4) and (5) to establish continuity at all other values - e.g., $$\lim_{h \to 0} \sin(x_0 + h) = \lim_{h \to 0}\sin(x_0)\cos(h) + \sin(h)\cos(x_0) = \sin(x_0)$$ (7) Now prove that $\sin(x), \cos(x)$ are differentiable. A notably different approach is that of Spivak's Calculus . Spivak tacitly assumes that the first question has been answered, and notices that in that case, $$ \pi = 2\int_{-1}^{1} \sqrt{1-x^2} dx $$ which resolves the second question, albeit not too directly. Also assuming that the area of a sector of an angle of $x$ radians is $\frac{x}{2}$, he defines $$ A(x) = \frac{x \sqrt{1- x^2}}{2} + \int_{x}^{1} \sqrt{1-t^2} dt$$ The area function is a function of the $x$-coordinate, not an angle $x$; it tends from $\frac{\pi}{2}$ to $0$ as $x$ goes from $-1$ to $1$. However, $\forall x \in [0, \pi]$, we have $\exists !y \in [-1, 1]: A(y) = \frac{x}{2}$; this $y$ we set as $\cos(x)$, and we define $\sin(x) = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2(x)}$. (The uniqueness of the value of $\cos(x)$ is guaranteed by the fact that $A(x)$ is decreasing and continuous.) The remainder of Spivak's derivation is about extending these functions (by symmetry) to the rest of $\mathbb{R}$. Although I am familiar with these derivations, they are rather prominently silent about the first question; I've never seen any answer to that question which impressed me as rigorous. I am not at all sure that there is an actual cut which one can write down (i.e., in set-builder notation, as an explicit subset of $\mathbb{Q}$ in the usual way) for $\pi$.","(I should say at the outset that this question is broad, and may need splitting up.
