I know that $n\neq1$ , as the last digit of the sum when $n\geq4$ is $3$ and no perfect square ends with $3$ , and it cannot be a perfect power since $3^3$ does not divide the sum when $n\geq8$ . I don’t know about when $n=2$ , since the only sure point when $1!^2+2!^2+3!^2+\cdots+n!^2$ cannot be a perfect power is when $n\geq1248828$ ,but I don’t have any idea if $1!^2+2!^2+3!^2+\cdots+2024!^2$ is a perfect power. If $n=3$ , then the sum isn’t a perfect square when $n\geq10$ as it is equal to $6\pmod{11}$ , and it cannot be a perfect power since $3^3\nmid1!^3+2!^3+3!^3+\cdots+n!^3$ when $n\geq5$ . If $n=5,7$ , then it is not a perfect power since $3^2$ dosen’t divide the sum. Also, for all $n$ that is even, the sum can’t be a perfect square because the sum is equal to $2\pmod{3}$ . Note also that if $n$ is odd, then $1!^n+2!^n+3!^n+\cdots+2024!^n$ isn’t a perfect powers because there is some power of three that does not divide the sum after some point(in some cases, $9$ even dosen’t divide the sum), and forces the sum to be perfect square in order to be a perfect power.

So I suspect that $1!^n+2!^n+3!^n+\cdots+2024!^n$ is never a perfect square unless $n$ is divisible by $3$ . Now, it forces us that $n$ has to be even in order for $1!^n+2!^n+3!^n+\cdots+2024!^n$ to be a higher odd prime perfect power.

43,Finding more constructible solutions to polynomial equations,Finding more constructible solutions to polynomial equations,,"Summary: I have two polynomial equations in four variables. How can I find solutions using constructible numbers ? Can I use the fact that I know one (or a few closely related) such solutions to find more beyond these? In my answer on constructing “double” circumscribed pentagons I characterized solutions to a geometric problem by two polynomial equations: \begin{align*} 0 &= a^2b^2c - a^2b^2d + a^2bd^2 - a^2cd^2 + ac^2d^2 - bc^2d^2 \\&\quad - a^2b - 4abc - b^2c - ac^2 + bc^2 + a^2d + b^2d + 4bcd - ad^2 + cd^2 + a - d \\ 0 &= a^2bc + ab^2c - ab^2d - a^2cd + ac^2d - bc^2d + abd^2 - bcd^2 - ab - ac + bd + cd \end{align*} Or, if you want to copy and paste them: 0 = a^2*b^2*c - a^2*b^2*d + a^2*b*d^2 - a^2*c*d^2 + a*c^2*d^2 - b*c^2*d^2 - a^2*b - 4*a*b*c - b^2*c - a*c^2 + b*c^2 + a^2*d + b^2*d + 4*b*c*d - a*d^2 + c*d^2 + a - d 0 = a^2*b*c + a*b^2*c - a*b^2*d - a^2*c*d + a*c^2*d - b*c^2*d + a*b*d^2 - b*c*d^2 - a*b - a*c + b*d + c*d Four different permutations of the roots of $5x^4 - 10x^2 + 1$ solve these equations, e.g. $$ a = -\sqrt{1+\frac2{\sqrt5}}\qquad b = -\sqrt{1-\frac2{\sqrt5}}\qquad c = \sqrt{1-\frac2{\sqrt5}}\qquad d = \sqrt{1+\frac2{\sqrt5}} $$ This solution corresponds to a geometric arrangement with a regular pentagon. But the question statement I was trying to answer was explicitly looking for a non-regular solution, so this specific solution is not acceptable. At the same time the original question was asking for a construction, so only a solution using constructible numbers would have a chance to satisfy that aspect. In my original answer I drew a picture using \begin{align*} a &= -1.2 & 5a+6 &= 0 \\ b &\approx -0.183 & 18032b^4 + 81385b^3 - 68156b^2 - 21040b - 1088 &= 0\\ c &= \phantom+0.5 & 2c-1 &= 0 \\ d &\approx \phantom+1.490 & 78608d^4 + 167620d^3 - 575824d^2 - 21430d + 368293 &= 0 \end{align*} But the Galois group of those polynomials for $b$ and $d$ is the $S_4$ with order $4!=24$ . Since that order is not a power of two, these algebraic numbers are proven not to be constructible. I could not provide a constructible answer, much less an actual construction. Core question: How can I find a solution where all four variables are distinct constructible numbers, and at least one of them is not a root of $5x^4 - 10x^2 + 1$ ? Ideally I would find some parametrization, where I can pick one rational number arbitrarily and derive all four variables from that. But even finding a single different solution should help understand this problem better. Given how surprisingly hard some similar-looking problems around diophantine equations turn out to be, I wouldn't be surprised at all if this is a fairly hard problem. So I'm also prepared to accept answers providing evidence showing this to indeed be a hard problem. Maybe by showing the existence question to be a reasonably generic instance of a known NP-hard problem, or pointers at literature discussing similar problems. I know usually I should show my own work for tackling the problem, but I don't have the first idea where to start. I attempted to isolate some additional relationships between the known regular pentagon arrangement, and combine that with the given equations using resultants. But the responses I got tended to either force the regular pentagon arrangement, or quickly lead to some numbers being equal to one another. I can't think of any systematic approach, just this hit and miss guesswork. One thing that I did find out is that if I use an affine combination of the four permutations of the regular solution, they will all satisfy the second equation. But not the first, and I haven't found a way to leverage this observation.","Summary: I have two polynomial equations in four variables. How can I find solutions using constructible numbers ?

So $f(6) = 30$ , $f(5) = 6$ . Which of the following are true? A. There are only finitely many $n$ such that $n|f(n)$ . B. There are only finitely many $n$ such that $n>f(n)$ . C. Given any $k,l \in \mathbb N$ , $f(n)=kn+l$ has infinitely many solutions. D. Let $S_k=\{l\in \mathbb N : f(l)=k\}$ . Let $a_k=\frac 1 {|S_k|}$ if $S_k\neq\phi$ , else $a_k=0$ . Then $\sum_{i=1}^\infty a_i$ does not converge to a rational number. Now, for A , I figured out an idea. Consider the set of the first $k$ primes $P_k=\{p_i : i\in \mathbb N_k \}$ where $\mathbb N_k=\{1,2,\dots ,k\}$ and let the $(k+1)$ -th prime be $p_{k+1}$ .

Now, if there is at least one element $x\in\prod P_k$ which is in the interval $(p_k,p_{k+1})$ , then it is trivial that $x|f(x)$ . And, I guess, there will always be such an $x$ . However, a proof of this, or a better way will be appreciated. For B , it is clear that $f(n)$ increases much much faster than $n$ . So, it's no doubt that it's true. Again, I would like to have a rigorous proof of this. For C , if we put $k=l=1$ , we can intuitively see that $f(n)=n+1$ will not have infinitely many solutions (since $f(n)$ increases much much faster than $n+1$ ). Again, a proof of this will be appreciated. My main problem was with D . I can figure out that $|S_k|\neq \phi$ iff $k$ is of the form $\prod_{i=1}^m p_i$ where $p_1,p_2,\dots ,p_m$ are the first $m$ primes. So, $a_k$ will either be $0$ (when $|S_k|=\phi$ ), or $a_k$ will be equal to the number of integers between $(p_{m}+1)$ and $p_{m+1}$ .
