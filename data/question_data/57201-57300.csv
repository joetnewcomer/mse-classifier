I'm reading H. Enderton's Elements of Set Theory and working through understanding the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms. While reading, the following question regarding the nature of sets occurred to me. Suppose I give you an infinite set of integers, which seems to have no definable pattern. For instance, suppose I start listing elements of the set: \begin{equation*} S=\{3,4,11,199,205,6090,11238,...\} \end{equation*} I have simply chosen numbers at complete random and ordered them. As far as I know, there is no formula that describes those numbers. Suppose this set continues forever. According to set theory, does this set exist? It seems hard to say it doesn't exist -- after all, I've begun to write it already, so how could it not exist? However, I believe set theory requires sets to have an explicit formula. Then the question becomes: given any arbitrary sequence of numbers like the one I've listed above (with no apparent ""pattern""), does there exist a formula describing the sequence?

Thank you for your thoughts and explanations! Edit : Thanks to Yuval for his answer! His answer raised some thoughts which I wanted to add to the question. Given an arbitrary set of integers, although I can't find a formula describing it, since the set of ALL integers exists, then by the power set axiom any subset of it should exist as well. So, could it just be that I'm just not clever enough to formulate an explicit formula for my arbitrary set of integers, but such a formula (as complicated as it may be!) actually exists? Maybe the existence of a formula describing any conceivable sequence of numbers is taken as an axiom, or maybe the opposite is true and it can be proven there exists a sequence without a formula. I'm also wondering, although I know very little about it -- does this question have anything to do with the Axiom of Choice?

So, consider a sequence $\{x^n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ such that $x=\lim_{n\to\infty}x^n$ . Suppose that I can show the sequence $\{\alpha(x^n)\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ has a convergent subsequence. Moreover, suppose that I can show all convergent subsequences of $\{\alpha(x^n)\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converge to $\alpha(x)$ . Does this imply that $\lim_{n\to\infty}\alpha(x^n)=\alpha(x)$ ? If so, why is that? As you can see, it seems that the proof below says ""yes"" to the above question. But I am confused, because every convergent subsequence converges to the same point does not necessarily imply the original sequence converges to that point (for example, consider the sequence $0,1,0,2,0,3,0,4,\dots$ ). I think we should instead prove that every subsequence of the original sequence converges to the same point. But I couldn't figure out how to do that. Am I missing anything? How should we fix this? Thanks a lot for any help! As I mentioned in the beginning, the question is from a proof of a theorem in mathematical economics. So let me state the theorem together with its proof in this section. In the next section, I will provide related notations and definitions. Theorem $\quad$ Suppose that the rational preference relation $\succsim$ on $X=\mathbb{R}^L_+$ is monotone and continuous. Then there exists a continuous utility function $u(x)$ that represents $\succsim$ . Before we prove the theorem, we need a lemma. Lemma $\quad$ For a monotone, continuous, and rational preference relation $\succsim$ on $X=\mathbb{R}^L_+$ , $y\geq x$ implies $y\succsim x$ . Proof of lemma $\quad$ Let $\succsim$ be a monotone, continuous, complete, and transitive preference relation on $X=\mathbb{R}^L_+$ . Suppose first that $y\gg x$ ; that is, $y_i>x_i$ for all $i=1,\dots,L$ . Then by the definition of monotonicity, $y\succ x$ and thus $y\succsim x$ . Now suppose that $y_i=x_i$ for some $i\in\{1,\dots,L\}$ and $y_k>x_k$ for all $k\neq i$ . (So $y\geq x$ .) Let $\{y^n\}$ be a sequence of points in $\mathbb{R}^L_+$ such that $y^n_k=y_k$ for $k\neq i$ and $y^n_i=y_i+\frac{1}{n}$ . Let $\{x^n\}$ be a sequence of points in $\mathbb{R}^L_+$ such that $x^n_k=x_k$ for $k\neq i$ and $x^n_i=x_i+\frac{1}{n+1}$ . Then for each $n$ , $y^n_k = y_k > x_k = x^n_k$ and $y^n_i = y_i + \frac{1}{n} = x_i + \frac{1}{n} > x_i + \frac{1}{n+1} = x^n_i$ . Thus $y^n\gg x^n$ , and monotonicity implies $y^n\succ x^n$ , and so $y^n\succsim x^n$ . So we have constructed a sequence of pairs $\{(x^n,y^n)\}$ with $y^n\succsim x^n$ for all $n$ , $x=\lim_{n\to\infty}x^n$ , and $y=\lim_{n\to\infty}y^n$ . Then continuity implies $y\succsim x$ . Now we prove the theorem. Proof $\quad$ We proceed our proof with the help of Figure 1. Denote the diagonal ray in $\mathbb{R}^L_+$ (the locus of vectors with all $L$ components equal) by $Z$ . It will be convenient to let $e$ designate the $L$ -vector whose elements are all equal to 1. Then $\alpha e\in Z$ for all nonnegative scalars $\alpha\geq0$ . By the above lemma, for every $x\in\mathbb{R}^L_+$ , we have $x\succsim 0$ . Also note that for any $\overline{\alpha}$ such that $\overline{\alpha}e\gg x$ (as drawn in the figure), we have $\overline{\alpha}e\succ x$ and so $\overline{\alpha}e\succsim x$ by monotonicity. Then, monotonicity and continuity can then be shown to imply that there is a unique value $\alpha(x)\in[0,\overline{\alpha}]$ such that $\alpha(x)e\sim x$ . Formally, this can be shown as follows: By continuity, the upper and lower contour sets of $x$ are closed. We show that the set $A^+ = \{\alpha\in\mathbb{R}_+:\alpha e\succsim x\}$ and $A^- = \{\alpha\in\mathbb{R}_+:x\succsim\alpha e\}$ are nonempty and closed. To see the nonemptiness of $A^+$ , note that for any $x=(x_1,\dots,x_L)\in\mathbb{R}_+$ , we can always choose an $\alpha' = \max\{x_1,\dots,x_L\}+1$ , so that $\alpha'e\succ x$ . Thus $A^+\neq\emptyset$ . To see the nonemptiness of $A^-$ , simply pick $\alpha''=0$ , so that $x\succsim0=\alpha''e$ would imply $A^-\neq\emptyset$ . We now prove the closedness of $A^+$ and $A^-$ . Let $\alpha$ be a limit point of $A^+$ . Then there exists a sequence $\{\alpha_n\}$ in $A^+$ such that $\alpha = \lim_{n\to\infty}\alpha_n$ and $\alpha_ne\succsim x$ for all $n$ . Consider the sequence of pairs $\{(x,\alpha_ne)\}$ with $\alpha_ne\succsim x$ , $x = \lim_{n\to\infty}x$ , and $\alpha e = \lim_{n\to\infty}\alpha_ne$ . By continuity, we have $\alpha e\succsim x$ , so that $\alpha\in A^+$ . Hence every limit point of $A^+$ is a point of $A^+$ , which means $A^+$ is closed. A similar argument would show that $A^-$ is closed. Finally, not that by completeness of $\succsim$ , $\mathbb{R}_+=(A^+\bigcup A^-)$ . Then the nonemptiness and closedness of $A^+$ and $A^-$ , together with the fact $\mathbb{R}_+$ is connected, imply that $A^+\bigcap A^-\neq\emptyset$ . Thus there exists a scalar $\alpha$ such that $\alpha e\sim x$ . Furthermore, by monotonicity, $\alpha_1e\sim\alpha_2e$ whenever $\alpha_1>\alpha_2$ . Hence there can be at most one scalar satisfying $\alpha e\sim x$ . This scalar is $\alpha(x)$ . We now take $\alpha(x)$ as our utility function; that is, we assign a utility value $u(x)=\alpha(x)$ to every $x$ . This utility level is also depicted in Figure 1. We need to check two properties of this function: that it represents the preference $\succsim$ (i.e., that $\alpha(x)\geq\alpha(y)$ if and only if $x\succsim y$ ) and that it is a continuous function. That $\alpha(x)$ represents preferences follows from its construction. Formally, suppose first that $\alpha(x)\geq\alpha(y)$ . Then either $\alpha(x)>\alpha(y)$ or $\alpha(x)=\alpha(y)$ . If $\alpha(x)>\alpha(y)$ , then $\alpha(x)e = (\alpha(x),\dots,\alpha(x)) \gg (\alpha(y),\dots,\alpha(y)) = \alpha(y)e$ . By the monotonicity, this implies that $\alpha(x)e\succ\alpha(y)e$ , and so $\alpha(x)e\succsim\alpha(y)e$ . If $\alpha(x)=\alpha(y)$ , then $\alpha(x)e=(\alpha(x),\dots,\alpha(x)) = (\alpha(y),\dots,\alpha(y))=\alpha(y)e$ . The above lemma implies that $\alpha(x)e\succsim\alpha(y)e$ . Therefore, $\alpha(x)e\succsim\alpha(y)e$ . Since $x\sim\alpha(x)e$ and $y\sim\alpha(y)e$ , we have $x\succsim y$ . Suppose, on the other hand, that $x\succsim y$ . Then $\alpha(x)e\sim x\succsim y\sim\alpha(y)e$ . Assume to the contrary that $\alpha(y)>\alpha(x)$ . Then $\alpha(y)e\gg\alpha(x)e$ , and monotonicity would imply that $y\sim\alpha(y)e\succ\alpha(x)e\sim x$ , a contradiction. Therefore, $\alpha(x)\geq\alpha(y)$ . (My question above essentially begins from here:) (Cont'd) We now argue that $\alpha(x)$ is a continuous function at all $x$ . Since every point of $\mathbb{R}^L_+$ is a limit point of $\mathbb{R}^L_+$ , we shall prove for any sequence $\{x^n\}$ with $x=\lim_{n\to\infty}x^n$ , we have $\lim_{n\to\infty}\alpha(x^n)=\alpha(x)$ . Hence consider a sequence $\{x^n\}$ such that $x=\lim_{n\to\infty}x^n$ . We note first that the sequence $\{\alpha(x^n)\}$ must have a convergent subsequence. By monotonicity, for any $\epsilon>0$ , $\alpha(x')$ lies in a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}_+$ , $[\alpha_0,\alpha_1]$ , for all $x'$ such that $\|x'-x\|\leq\epsilon$ (see the figure below). Since $\{x^n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges to $x$ , there exists an $N$ such that $\alpha(x^n)$ lies in this compact set for all $n>N$ . But any infinite sequence that lies in a compact set must have a convergent subsequence. What remains is to establish that all convergent subsequences of $\{\alpha(x^n)\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges to $\alpha(x)$ . To see this, suppose otherwise: that there is some strictly increasing function $m(\cdot)$ that assigns to each positive integer $n$ a positive integer $m(n)$ and for which the subsequence $\{\alpha(x^{m(n)})\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges to $\alpha'\neq\alpha(x)$ . We first show that $\alpha'>\alpha(x)$ leads to a contradiction. To begin, note that monotonicity would then imply that $\alpha'e\succ\alpha(x)e$ . Now, let $\hat{\alpha} = \frac{1}{2}[\alpha'+\alpha(x)]$ . The point $\hat{\alpha}e$ is the midpoint on $Z$ between $\alpha'e$ and $\alpha(x)e$ (see the second figure). By monotonicity, $\hat{\alpha}e\succ\alpha(x)e$ . Now, since $\alpha(x^{m(n)})\to\alpha'>\hat{\alpha}$ , there exists an $\overline{N}$ such that for all $n>\overline{N}$ , $\alpha(x^{m(n)})>\hat{\alpha}$ . Hence, for all such $n$ , $x^{m(n)}\sim\alpha(x^{m(n)})e\succ\hat{\alpha}e$ (where the latter relation follows from monotonicity). Because preferences are continuous, this would imply that $x\succsim\hat{\alpha}e$ . But since $x\sim\alpha(x)e$ , we get $\alpha(x)e\succsim\hat{\alpha}e$ , which is a contradiction. The argument ruling out $\alpha'<\alpha(x)$ is similar. Thus, since all convergent subsequences of $\{\alpha(x^n)\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ must converge to $\alpha(x)$ , we have $\lim_{n\to\infty}\alpha(x^n)=\alpha(x)$ , and we done.

Notation $\quad$ Let $x,y\in\mathbb{R}^N$ so $x=(x_1,\dots,x_N)$ and $y=(y_1,\dots,y_N)$ .

Definition $\quad$ The preference relation $\succsim$ on $X$ is monotone if $x\in X$ and $y\gg x$ implies $y\succ x$ . Definition $\quad$ The preference relation $\succsim$ on $X$ is continuous if it is preserved under limits.

But after some thoughts and some further elaboration, I wrote my proof ""more"" formally and thus I wanted to post it again to clarify some details. So, here it goes: Theorem. Let $a$ be a essential singularity of $f$ , then we have that, for any $A \in \mathbb{C}$ there exists a sequence $\left(z_k\right)_{k=0}^{+\infty}$ such that this sequence converges to $a$ and such that $f(z_k) \rightarrow A$ . Proof so far. By contradition: Suposse that $\exists A \in \mathbb{C}$ such that the conclusion of the theorem doesn't hold, i.e., $\exists \epsilon >0$ such that $|z-A|<\epsilon$ doesn't agree with the image of $f$ . Thus, $\forall z \neq a$ , we have that $|f(z)-A|\geq\epsilon$ . Now, consider the particular case of $g(z) = \frac{1}{f(z)-A}$ in a deleted neighbourhood of $a$ . It obviously comes that $|g(z)|\leq \frac{1}{\epsilon}$ . Since $g(z)$ is analytic in a deleted neighbourhood of $a$ , $a$ is also a singular point of $g$ and $a$ is also a removable singularity (using Riemann's Theorem), once it's limited near $a$ . From this, it urges that $\lim_{z\rightarrow a}g(z)$ exists, call it $g(a)$ , and we also have that $g$ extends to a analytic function in $a$ . Now, if $g(a)=0$ , we have that, we have that $\lim_{z\rightarrow a}f(z) = \infty$ and so, $a$ would be a pole of $f$ , which is a contradiction. If $g(a) \neq 0$ , we have that $\lim_{z\rightarrow a}f(z) = A + \frac{1}{g(a)}$ which means, again using the Rimeann's Theorem, that $f$ has a removable singularity, which is (once again) a contradiction. NOTE. Proving that there exists a sequence $\left(z_k\right)_{k=0}^{+\infty}$ such that $f(z_k) \rightarrow A$ is equivalent to proving that the image of $f$ is dense in $\mathbb{C}$ . My final doubts and needs of clarification. I can see clearly where this proves that $f(z_k)\rightarrow A$ . What I am having trouble with is the first part of the theorem, i.e, seeing where this proves that $z_k \rightarrow a$ .

The series $\sum p_n$ , $\sum q_n$ must both diverge. For if both were convergent, then $$\sum \left( p_n + q_n \right) = \sum |a_n|$$ would converge, contrary to hypothesis. Since $$ \sum_{n=1}^N a_n = \sum_{n=1}^N \left( p_n - q_n \right) = \sum_{n=1}^N p_n - \sum_{n=1}^N q_n,$$ divergence of $\sum p_n$ and convergence of $\sum q_n$ (or vice versa) implies divergence of $\sum a_n$ , again contrary to hypothesis. Now let $P_1, P_2, P_3, \ldots$ denote the non-negative terms of $\sum a_n$ , in the order in which they occur, and let $Q_1, Q_2, Q_3, \ldots$ be the absolute values of the negative terms of $\sum a_n$ , also in their original order. The series $\sum P_n$ , $\sum Q_n$ differ from $\sum p_n$ , $\sum q_n$ only by zero terms, and are therefore divergent. We shall construct sequences $\{m_n \}$ , $\{k_n\}$ , such that the series $$ P_1 + \cdots + P_{m_1} - Q_1 - \cdots - Q_{k_1} + P_{m_1 + 1} + \cdots + P_{m_2} - Q_{k_1 + 1} - \cdots - Q_{k_2} + \cdots \tag{25}, $$ which clearly is a rearrangement of $\sum a_n$ , satisfies (24). Choose real-valued sequences $\{ \alpha_n \}$ , $\{ \beta_n \}$ such that $\alpha_n \rightarrow \alpha$ , $\beta_n \rightarrow \beta$ , $\alpha_n < \beta_n$ , $\beta_1 > 0$ . Let $m_1$ , $k_1$ be the smallest integers such that $$P_1 + \cdots + P_{m_1} > \beta_1,$$ $$P_1 + \cdots + P_{m_1} - Q_1 - \cdots - Q_{k_1} < \alpha_1;$$ let $m_2$ , $k_2$ be the smallest integers such that $$P_1 + \cdots + P_{m_1} - Q_1 - \cdots - Q_{k_1} + P_{m_1 + 1} + \cdots + P_{m_2} > \beta_2,$$ $$P_1 + \cdots + P_{m_1} - Q_1 - \cdots - Q_{k_1} + P_{m_1 + 1} + \cdots + P_{m_2} - Q_{k_1 + 1} - \cdots - Q_{k_2} < \alpha_2;$$ and continue in this way. This is possible since $\sum P_n$ , $\sum Q_n$ diverge.
