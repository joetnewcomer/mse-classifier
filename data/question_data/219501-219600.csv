0,Are there applications of noncommutative geometry to number theory?,Are there applications of noncommutative geometry to number theory?,,"The marriage of algebraic geometry and number theory was celebrated in the twentieth century by the school of Grothendieck. As a consequence, number theory has been completely transformed. On the other hand, the school of Alain Connes developped a theory to include the study of non-commutative rings in algebraic geometry. As far as I understand, the tree branched off in these two separate directions, with number theory staying mostly on the commutative side of things, for the natural reason that the rings one encounters in number theory are mostly commutative. I'd like to know if the development of noncommutative geometry has had an impact on number theory. Has it led to concrete advancements? Has it influenced the way people think about some topics?

Question: What are examples of nice descriptive papers or books which are concentrated on impacts and connections of Grothendick's theorems and theories in mathematics, specially those which describe the influence of his works on those parts of mathematics which were developed before him and are under development now?

2,A space of ideals,A space of ideals,,"Definition: Let $R$ be a commutative ring with 1.  Endow the power set $2^R$ with the product topology.  The ideal space $\mathcal{I}(R)$ is defined to be subset of $2^R$ consisting of ideals, equipped with the induced topology. This is the ring-theoretic analogue of the Gromov--Grigorchuk space of marked groups, which can be used to give nice proofs of simple facts about algebraic geometry over groups (cf. this paper by Champetier and Guirardel).  My question is: Is the 'ideal space' of a ring a standard construction in commutative algebra or algebraic geometry?  If so, what's it called and where can I read more about it? My motivation is to strengthen the analogy between algebraic geometry over groups and classical algebraic geometry. To demonstrate that it's a useful concept, I'll give an application.  But first, here are a few basic facts. $\mathcal{I}(R)$ is compact (because it is a closed subset of $2^R$, which is itself compact by Tychonoff's Theorem), Hausdorff and totally disconnected. Each point $I\in \mathcal{I}(R)$ is contained in a canonical closed subset $U_I=\{J\in \mathcal{I}(R)\mid I\subseteq J \}$ (which is in fact isomorphic to $\mathcal{I}(R/I)$). If $R$ is Noetherian then each $U_I$ is equal to the set of ideals that contain a (finite) generating set for $I$, and hence is open. The subset of prime ideals in $\mathcal{I}(R)$ is closed: indeed, for each pair of non-units $x,y$, the subset $N(x,y)=\{x\notin I, y\notin I, xy\in I\}$ is open, and the union of these sets is the complement of the set of prime ideals. Now here's a sample application -  a proof of a well known lemma. Lemma: If $R$ is a Noetherian ring then there is a finite set of prime ideals $\mathfrak{p}_1,\ldots,\mathfrak{p}_k\subseteq R$ with the property that every prime ideal contains one of the $\mathfrak{p}_i$. Proof: The set of $U_{\mathfrak{p}}$ for $\mathfrak{p}$ prime is an open cover of the set of prime ideals.  Since the set of prime ideals is compact, there is a finite subcover.

21,Local vs. global in the definition of a sheaf,Local vs. global in the definition of a sheaf,,"Apologies in advance that this question is inescapably soft. What I am stuck on is squishy; I have the feeling that if I could even make it precise, I'd already be satisfied. To what extent is a sheaf determined by its stalks? Is there global information about the sheaf hiding in the stalks? Here is the story of what is bugging me. One of the first things I learned about sheaves was the sheafification of a presheaf. How I think about the sheafification is that it is the unique sheaf with the stalks dictated by the presehaf.  Thus early on I began to think of a sheaf as an object that is entirely determined by local information. There is the caveat that sections of the sheaf must come from gluing germs together ""compatibly,"" which implies that nearby stalks are talking to each other to decide what the sheaf is, but ""nearby-ness"" can be as small as it wants to in this context, so the sheaf still feels basically like a local object. (This paragraph is very vague; see below for some clarification if needed.) Now, more recently I have been studying locally free sheaves on schemes. What is bugging me is that locally free sheaves of a given rank cannot be distinguished by looking at the stalks, at least up to algebraic isomorphism. For example if $\mathscr{L}$ is an invertible sheaf, aka line bundle, on a scheme $X$ , then $\mathscr{L}_p = \mathcal{O}_{X,p}$ for every $p\in X$ , so different invertible sheaves on $X$ are not distinguished by their stalks. They are distinguished by the ways that the patches of a local trivialization of the bundle are glued together, which is a global consideration. In light of the last paragraph, how is this happening? Is it that the requirement that ""nearby germs be glued together compatibly"" to make sections allows all this global information to be stored in a local way? If so, how? Or is the argument in the previous paragraph that sheaves are determined by local information fundamentally wrong, in which case what am I missing? Anything you could tell me to help me think clearly about this situation would be much appreciated. Appendices (you can ignore, but thoughts are welcome) Clarification: Let me make explicit what I'm referring to in the paragraph above about sheafification. My definition of the sheafification is coming from Hartshorne: let $\mathscr{F}$ be a presheaf on a topological space $X$ and let $U$ be an open subset of $X$ . The sections of the sheafification of $\mathscr{F}$ over $U$ are functions $f:U\rightarrow\coprod_{p\in U}\mathscr{F}_p$ such that for all $p\in U$ , (1) $f(p)\in\mathscr{F}_p$ and (2) there exists open $V\subset U$ containing $p$ and $g\in \mathscr{F}(V)$ such that $f(q)$ equals $g$ 's germ in $\mathscr{F}_q$ for all $q\in V$ . Condition (2), about the existence of $V$ , is what I meant by ""sections come from gluing germs together compatibly."" What I meant by ""nearby-ness can be as small as it wants to"" was the fact that $V$ is an arbitrary (i.e. arbitrarily small) open neighborhood of $p$ . More thoughts: The above discussion brought to mind the monodromy theorem from complex analysis: the germ of an analytic function at a single point in a simply connected region of $\mathbb{C}$ determines the function on the whole region. However, with more thought, I feel like it cannot be something like this that is going on: let $X$ be a topological manifold and let $S,T$ be two fiber bundles on $X$ with individual fibers homeomorphic but that are not isomorphic globally.  Then the sheaves of sections should have isomorphic stalks, right? But now there is no ""rigidity"" result analogous to the monodromy theorem or anything that would happen with an algebraic vector bundle: if $p\in X$ and $U$ is any open neighborhood of $p$ no matter how small, the germ of a section at $p$ will not determine the section anywhere outside $U$ . This seems to me to free the stalks of the sheaves of sections from enmeshment with any but their closest neighbors. Yet still , the bundles will be distinguished by these sheaves! So the global information contained in the sheaves cannot be coming from some sort of rigidity theorem like the monodromy theorem or some sort of algebraic rigidity. A final thought: I was moved to post this question because I kept getting stuck at step (2) while giving myself the following exercise: (1) realize $\mathcal{O}(1)$ as the sheaf of sections of an algebraic vector bundle, described explicitly with a gluing construction, as I did in this previous question ; (2) use this explicit description to compute an equally explicit description of its dual sheaf. I keep getting stuck because I haven't been able to see how to use the gluing information when writing down the dual.

31,What is a geometric interpretation of regular sequences in various instances?,What is a geometric interpretation of regular sequences in various instances?,,"This question arose from my attempts to understand the inclusion Regular $\subset$ Complete Intersection $\subset$ Gorenstein $\subset$ Cohen Macaulay There are many related questions here and in mathoverflow and they have been really helpful but I didn't find much on a geometric interpretation of regular sequences themselves.

It seems to me that there are at least two different contexts in which regular sequences are important: When they live inside the ideal $I$ that defines the variety: There, after we localize at a point, if $I$ is generated by a regular sequence, the local ring is a Complete Intersection ring. When they live inside the ring itself: There, after we localize at a point $P$, if the maximal size of a regular sequence is equal to $\operatorname{codim}P$, the ring is Cohen Macaulay. For the first part of my question, I am asking for a geometric interpretation that maybe binds these two cases together. Is it just the normal way of treating depth as a sort of dimension where we want to describe our variety via succesive intersections of hypersurfaces?

So I mean in particular the product over $\operatorname{Spec} \mathbb{Z}$ (or $\operatorname{Spec} k$ for varieties). I also know of a near example where the product is allowed to be ""twisted"" as in a fibration / locally a product, though in this case the fibers are affine, namely: $GL_2(\mathbb{C}) \to \mathbb{CP}^1$. (Here the map is the one induced by the natural action. The fibers are the invertible upper triangular matrices, etc.) (This example really can't be refined to an answer to my original question, for the reasons of the next paragraph.)

This can be shown to be equivalent to $T_pX = \mathrm{ker} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_1}(p) & \ldots & \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_n}(p) \\ \vdots & \ldots & \vdots \\ \frac{\partial f_r}{\partial x_1}(p) & \ldots & \frac{\partial f_r}{\partial x_n}(p) \end{pmatrix}: k^n \to k^r$. For $X$ an arbitrary variety, we define $T_pX = T_pU$ where $U$ is any affine open neighbourhood of $p$ (this can be shown to be well-defined). If $X$ is an irreducible variety, define $\mathrm{dim}(X) = \mathrm{min} \{ \mathrm{dim} \ T_pX \ | \ p \in X \}$. If $X$ is irreducible and $k$ is algebraically closed, say $p \in X$ is a smooth point if $\mathrm{dim} \ T_pX = \mathrm{dim} X$, and say $p$ is singular otherwise. For question i), seeing as my definition of singular only applies to irreducible varieties, I better show $V$ is in fact irreducible. I'm not sure how easy this is - I can't really spot how to do it. With some guesswork I'd say that $k[V] \cong k[x^2, x^3]$ which is clearly in integral domain so $V$ is irreducible, but I'm not sure about the details. Now let's write out the relevant matrix: $\begin{pmatrix} 3p_1^2 & 0 & -1 \\ 0 & 2p_2 & -1 \end{pmatrix}$ where $p = (p_1, p_2, p_3)$. We have the points $p = (\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}, \frac{1}{2}, p_3)$ where the rank is $2$  i.e. $\mathrm{dim}T_p X = 1$. The rank can obviously never be $3$, so we have that $\mathrm{dim}X = 1$. So the singular points are those for which the rank is 1. That's true precisely for the points $\{ (0,0,t) \ | \ t \in k \}$. For question ii), I'm also unsure. Again, why is the surface $Y$ irreducible? Now I'm not sure how to deal with the fact that we're in projective space, so what I'm writing from now onwards may be complete nonsense. We have the standard affine open cover $\mathbb P^3 = U_0 \cup \ldots \cup U_3$, and it's obvious that $Y \cap U_0 \neq \emptyset$. So if the first coordinate of $p$ is non-zero, we can use the definition above to ascertain $T_pY = T_p (Y\cap U_0)$. If the first coordinate is zero, I'll worry about that later. So we're now assuming the first coordinate of $p$ isn't zero, and we're living in (irreducible if $Y$ is) affine space. The ""affine"" (de-homogenised) polynomial corresponding to $X_1 X_2^2 - X_3^3$ is just $xy^2 - z^3 \in k[x,y,z]$. Now there's a lemma that says if $f \in k[x_1, \ldots , x_n]$ is prime, then $\mathrm{dim} Z(f) = n - 1$. I'll assume our polynomial is prime (I don't know what else to do, so I might as well check later). So the singular points are those for which $\mathrm{dim} T_p (Y \cap U_0) = 3$, which are precisely those whose partial derivatives all vanish. These are the points $\{ (t,0,0) \ | \ t \in k^\times \}$, and the tangent spaces all have dimension 3. Now I think about it, if the first coordinate of $p$ is 0 everything seems to break, so let's leave the answer there. I greatly appreciate the effort it takes to wade through this potential nonsense. My method seems very long-winded; I don't know if I've missed the point somewhere, or if the definitions I'm using are bad, or if this genuinely is how to go about solving these problems. I'm especially unconfident in my answer to ii). Thank you.","I'm currently looking at the following two questions: i) Consider $V = Z(I) \subset \mathbb A_k^3$ where $I$ is generated by $X_1^3 - X_3$ and $X_2^2-X_3$.

After a fair amount of work, I have come to believe that we can obtain $Y,Z$ explicitly as follows: Let $U_1=\operatorname{Spec} \mathbb{R}[x,y]$ and let $U_2=\operatorname{Spec} \mathbb{R}[x',y']$, and identify $U_1\setminus \{x=0\} = \operatorname{Spec} \mathbb{R}[x,x^{-1},y]$ with $U_2\setminus \{x'=0\} = \operatorname{Spec}\mathbb{R}[x',x'^{-1},y']$ via the scheme isomorphism induced from the ring isomorphism $x'\mapsto x^{-1}$, $y'\mapsto x^{-1}y$. Let $Y$ be the quotient of the disjoint union $U_1\cup U_2$ by this identification. Let the projection morphism $f:Y\rightarrow X$ be given by projection to the $x$-axis on $U_1$ and to the $x'$-axis on $U_2$. (In scheme-theoretic terms, the projection $U_1\rightarrow \mathbb{A}^1$ is the morphism coming from the ring inclusion $\mathbb{R}[x]\hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}[x,y]$ and similarly for $U_2$.) We get $Z$ from the exact same construction except the isomorphism of $U_1\setminus\{x=0\}$ with $U_2\setminus \{x'=0\}$ is given by $x'\mapsto x^{-1}, y'\mapsto xy$ this time. My initial question: Do you agree with these constructions? As a plausibility check, we know $\mathcal{O}_X(1)$ has a 2-dimensional vector space of global sections; these should correspond to sections of $Y/X$. I believe we get a basis of sections from the section $u$ that looks like $y=1$ on $U_1$ and $y'=x'$ on $U_2$ and the section $v$ that looks like $y'=1$ on $U_2$ and $y=x$ on $U_1$.  On the other hand, we know $\mathcal{O}_X(-1)$ has no nonzero global sections; this results from the fact that if a section looks like $y'=g(x')$ on $U_2$ (for $g$ some nonzero polynomial) it should look like $y = x^{-1}g(x^{-1})$ on $U_1$, but this can not possibly be regular at $x=0$. My main question: $Y, Z$ are not manifolds because they're schemes, but we can copy their construction with copies of the smooth manifold $\mathbb{R}^2$ instead of the scheme $\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{R}^2$; it seems to me that this will give us real vector bundles over $S^1$ that are both diffeomorphic to the Möbius band (without boundary) and I'd like to know if you agree. To be explicit about the construction: Let $U_1=\mathbb{R}^2$ with coordinate functions $x,y$. Let $U_2=\mathbb{R}^2$ with coordinate functions $x',y'$.  Identify $U_1\setminus \{x=0\}$ with $U_2\setminus\{x'=0\}$ by $(x',y')\sim (x^{-1},x^{-1}y)$. The result is a smooth manifold because this identification gives smooth transition functions between the two coordinate patches. Restricting the construction to the $x$ and $x'$-axes gives $\mathbb{R}P^1\cong S^1$. Furthermore, for fixed $x$, the transition function $y'=x^{-1}y$ is linear in $y$, so it seems to me this implies the result is a line bundle over $S^1$. Let this be $\mathbf{Y}$. Create $\mathbf{Z}$ the same way except using $(x',y')\sim (x^{-1},xy)$.

But two common nodes in $I,J$ contribute at least (and exactly in the generic case) $8 = 2\times 2 + 2\times 2$  in the intersections. So the number of real intersections (i.e. intersections in $\mathbb R^2$) is at most $8$. However, according to my experience with Mathematica , I think that the maximum number of intersections is at most 6.  So what is the correct answer to this problem?  If the answer is 6, where are the other two complex points, and can we prove their existence algebraically?  (Note I'm interested in the algebraic approach to this problem and not analytic or topological solutions.)

72,Why isn't every finite locally free morphism etale?,Why isn't every finite locally free morphism etale?,,"I have been reading the notes here . There, a finite locally free morphism of schemes is defined as as a morphism of schemes $f: X \rightarrow Y$ which is finite and for which the sheaf $f_{*} \mathcal{O}_{X}$ is locally free as an $\mathcal{O}_{Y}$ -module. A finite etale morphism is then defined as a morphism of schemes $f: X \rightarrow Y$ which is finite locally free, and for which the fiber over any point $q \in Y$ is an etale $\kappa(q)$ -algebra. I am struggling to understand what the part about the fibers being etale algebras adds at all. It seems like every finite locally free morphism would trivially satisfy this. Take $f: X \rightarrow Y$ to be a finite locally free morphism of schemes. For any $q \in Y$ , choose an affine $\operatorname{spec}A$ around $q$ small enough so that $f_{*} \mathcal{O}_{X}$ is free, say of degree $d$ . Then since $f$ is finite, it is in particular affine, so the morphism looks locally like $\operatorname{spec}(A^{\oplus d}) \rightarrow \operatorname{spec}A$ . Then the fiber over $q$ is just $\operatorname{spec}(\kappa(q)^{\oplus d})$ . This seems to trivially be an etale $\kappa(q)$ -algebra, since tensoring with some algebraic closure $\Omega$ would give $d$ copies of $\Omega$ . Where is the flaw in my reasoning?

A finite etale morphism is then defined as a morphism of schemes which is finite locally free, and for which the fiber over any point is an etale -algebra. I am struggling to understand what the part about the fibers being etale algebras adds at all. It seems like every finite locally free morphism would trivially satisfy this.

Write this fiber as a union of irreducible components $Z_1 \cup \cdots \cup Z_r$ corresponding to prime ideals $\mathfrak{p}_1,\cdots,\mathfrak{p}_r \subset A$, so there is an associated semi-local ring $S^{-1}A$ with $S = A \setminus (\mathfrak{p}_1 \cup \cdots \cup \mathfrak{p}_r)$. Hopefully here $(f_*\mathcal{F})_y$ is just $S^{-1}M$ regarded as an $\mathcal{O}_{Y,y}$-module via the natural map $\mathcal{O}_{Y,y} \to S^{-1}A$. Does this make sense? Is something like this true when $X$ is not affine and/or the fiber is nonreduced? Edit: As Georges's answer shows, this cannot possibly be true in general. I wonder if there is still hope when $f$ is proper? My example in the comments below (the squaring map $\mathbb{A}^1 \to \mathbb{A}^1$ with $\mathcal{F} = \mathcal{O}$ and $y = 1$) is actually consistent with my guess above: $(f_*\mathcal{F})_y$ is the localization of $k[t]$ at $k[t^2] \setminus (t^2-1)k[t^2]$. It is not hard to see that this coincides with the localization at $k[t] \setminus ((t-1) \cup (t+1))$, i.e. the semilocal ring at $\{ \pm 1 \}$.",,"['algebraic-geometry', 'quasicoherent-sheaves']"
