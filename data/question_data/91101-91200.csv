Let $\omega=B_1\setminus\{0\}$ and $W^{1,p}(\omega)$ the Sobolev space with the same $p<+\infty$ as before. The question is to show that $W^{1,p}(B_1)=W^{1,p}(\omega)$. I think that the question is to be intended as follows: show that for all $\varphi\in C^\infty_c(B_1)$ if $u\in W^{1,p}(\omega)$ and $\partial_i u$ is a weak derivative, then $$\int_\omega u \,\partial_i\varphi=-\int_\omega\partial_iu\,\varphi,$$ since the converse (that is taking $\varphi\in C^\infty_c(\omega)$ and $u\in W^{1,p}(B_1)$ and verify the definition of weak derivative) is trivial because $C^\infty_c(\omega)\subset C^\infty_c(B_1)$. I tried this: take $\varphi\in C^\infty_c(B_1)$ and $u\in W^{1,p}(\omega)$. Take the function $\eta\in C^\infty_c(B_1)$ given by $$\eta(x)=e^{\frac{|x|^2}{|x|^2-1}}$$ and consider the functions $\eta_r(x)=\eta(x/r)$ for $r\in(0,1)$ extended to zero outside the ball $B_r$. If my calculation are right we have: $$\|\eta_r\|_p=\|\eta\|_p r^{\frac{2}{p}}$$ $$\|\nabla\eta_r\|_p=\|\nabla\eta\|_pr^{\frac{2}{p}-1}$$ Take $\psi_r\in C^\infty_c(B_1)$ a function such that $$\|\psi_r-\eta_r\|_{W^{1,p}}<r \qquad supp(\psi_r)=B_r \qquad \psi_r|_{B_{\epsilon(r)}}=1$$ for some $\epsilon(r)>0$ sufficiently small. So the function $\tilde{\varphi}_r=\varphi-\psi_r\varphi\in C^\infty_c(\omega)$ is such that $$\tilde{\varphi}_r\to\varphi \mbox{ in }L^p\qquad \mbox{as }r\to0$$ $$\nabla\tilde{\varphi}_r\to\nabla\varphi \mbox{ in }L^p\qquad \mbox{as }r\to0\qquad \mbox{if } p<2$$ in fact for $p<2$ we have that $\eta_r\to0$ in $W^{1,p}(\omega)$. Now for all $r$ we have $$\int_\omega u \,\partial_i\tilde{\varphi}_r=-\int_\omega\partial_iu\,\tilde{\varphi}_r,$$ then taking $\lim_{r\to0}$ we get the claim for $p<2$.

If my calculation are right we have: $$\|\eta_r\|_p=\|\eta\|_p r^{\frac{2}{p}}$$ $$\|\nabla\eta_r\|_p=\|\nabla\eta\|_pr^{\frac{2}{p}-1}$$ Take $\psi_r\in C^\infty_c(B_1)$ a function such that $$\|\psi_r-\eta_r\|_{W^{1,p}}<r \qquad supp(\psi_r)=B_r \qquad \psi_r|_{B_{\epsilon(r)}}=1$$ for some $\epsilon(r)>0$ sufficiently small. So the function $\tilde{\varphi}_r=\varphi-\psi_r\varphi\in C^\infty_c(\omega)$ is such that $$\tilde{\varphi}_r\to\varphi \mbox{ in }L^p\qquad \mbox{as }r\to0$$ $$\nabla\tilde{\varphi}_r\to\nabla\varphi \mbox{ in }L^p\qquad \mbox{as }r\to0\qquad \mbox{if } p<2$$ in fact for $p<2$ we have that $\eta_r\to0$ in $W^{1,p}(\omega)$. Now for all $r$ we have $$\int_\omega u \,\partial_i\tilde{\varphi}_r=-\int_\omega\partial_iu\,\tilde{\varphi}_r,$$ then taking $\lim_{r\to0}$ we get the claim for $p<2$. My questions: Is my procedure right? What is a better proof in order to achieve the claim for all $p<+\infty$? SECOND: This should be more advanced. Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ open and let $K\subset\Omega$ closed such that $\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(K)=0$ where $\mathcal{H}^{n-1}$ is the $(n-1)$-dimensional Hausdorff measure. Show that $W^{1,p}(\Omega)=W^{1,p}(\Omega\setminus K)$ for $p<+\infty$ (in the same sense of the first question I think). The only hint I had is that here it is needed some (I hope basic) result of geometric measure theory.",,"['real-analysis', 'functional-analysis', 'analysis', 'sobolev-spaces', 'geometric-measure-theory']"

We denote with $W^{1,p}(I)$ the set of functions $u:I\to\mathbb{R}$ with $u\in L^p(I)$ whose weak partial derivatives $\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i}$ are in $L^p(I)$ for every $i=1,..,n$. We endow this space with the following norm: $\|u\|_{W^{1,p}}=(\|u\|_{L^p}^p+\|\nabla u\|_{L^p}^p)^{\frac{1}{p}}$, if $1\le p<\infty$ and $\|u\|_{W^{1,\infty}}=\max\{\|u\|_{L^\infty},\|\nabla u\|_{L^\infty}\}$ if $p=\infty$. Now, if $1\le p<\infty$, we define $W_0^{1,p}(I)$ to be the $W^{1,p}$-norm closure of $C_0^\infty(I)$. For $p=\infty$, we set $W_0^{1,\infty}(I)=W^{1,\infty}(I)\cap W^{1,1}(I)$. Question: Why don't we set $W_0^{1,\infty}(I)$ as the $W^{1,\infty}$-norm closure of $C_0^\infty(I)$, analogously as for $1\le p<\infty$, i.e. why is $W_0^{1,\infty}(I)=W^{1,\infty}(I)\cap W^{1,1}(I)$ the better definition?

Let's show here for example the proof of ${\ell}^p = L^p$ with $(\mathbb{N} , \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N}) , \mu)$ in the example of footnote in case of somebody want to see it. But now, we continue to consider other two sequence spaces: \begin{equation} c = \{{\{a_n\}}_{n = 1}^{\infty} : {\{a_n\}}_{n = 1}^{\infty} \mbox{ is a convergent sequence}\} \mbox{ and } c_0 = \{{\{a_n\}}_{n = 1}^{\infty} : {\{a_n\}}_{n = 1}^{\infty} \mbox{ converges to } 0\}\mbox{.} \end{equation} If I have an abstract measure space $(X , \mathcal{M} , \mu)$, can I find two function spaces $T_1$ and $T_2$ on $(X , \mathcal{M} , \mu)$ such that $T_1 = c$ and $T_2 = c_0$ if I consider in particular the measure space $(\mathbb{N} , \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N}) , \mu)$? Example. We consider the measure space $(\mathbb{N} , \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N}) , \mu)$, where $\mu : \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N}) \to [0 , + \infty]$ is the counter measure on $(\mathbb{N} , \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N}))$. Let ${\{a_n\}}_{n = 1}^{\infty}$ a sequence of real (or complex) numbers. One hand, let $f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ (or $\mathbb{C}$) a non-negative function, which implies, considering the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$, that $f$ is a measurable function and we suppose that $f(n) = a_n$ for all $n = 1 , 2 , \ldots$. Let $p \in [1 , \infty)$. Then $$ \int_{\mathbb{N}} {|f|}^p d \mu = \int_{\bigcup_{n = 1}^{\infty} \{n\}} {|f|}^p d \mu = \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\int_{\{n\}} {|f|}^p d \mu = \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \int_{\mathbb{N}} \left({|f|}^p {\chi}_{\{n\}}\right) d \mu\mbox{.} $$ The other hand, given $n \in \mathbb{N}$, ${|f|}^p {\chi}_{\{n\}} : \mathbb{N} \to [0 , \infty)$ is $$ ({|f|}^p {\chi}_{\{n\}})(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{rcl} {|f(x)|}^p & \mbox{si} & x \in \{n\}\mbox{;} \\ 0 & \mbox{si} & x \notin \{n\}\mbox{;} \end{array} \right\} = \left\{ \begin{array}{rcl} {|f(n)|}^p & \mbox{si} & x = n\mbox{;} \\ 0 & \mbox{si} & x \neq n\mbox{,} \end{array} \right. $$ because of this $$ \int_{\mathbb{N}} \left({|f|}^p {\chi}_{\{n\}}\right) d \mu = {|f(n)|}^p \mu(\{n\}) + 0 \cdot \mu({\{n\}}^c) = {|f(n)|}^p \mu(\{n\}) + 0 = {|f(n)|}^p \mu(\{n\}) = {|f(n)|}^p\mbox{.} $$ Then $$ \int_{\mathbb{N}} {|f|}^p d \mu = \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \int_{\mathbb{N}} \left({|f|}^p {\chi}_{\{n\}}\right) d \mu = \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} {|f(n)|}^p = \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} {|a_n|}^p\mbox{.} $$ Finally, $$ L^p = \left\{f : X \to \mathbb{R} \mbox{ (or } \mathbb{C}\mbox{)}, \int_X {|f|}^p d \mu < \infty\right\} = \left\{{\{a_n\}}_{n = 1}^{\infty} : \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} {|a_n|}^p < \infty\right\} = {\ell}^p\mbox{.} $$",,"['real-analysis', 'functional-analysis']"

Let $G$ be a amenable group and $H$ an normal amenable subgroup ($H$ is automatically amenable if $G$ is amenable since if you have a left invariant mean $\mu\in S(l^{\infty}(G))$ then you can construct a left invariant mean $\mu\circ \iota \in S(l^{\infty}(H))$, where $\iota :l^{\infty}(H)\to l^{\infty}(\bigsqcup_{i\in I} Hg_i)\; f\mapsto f_i$ with $f_i(hg_i)=f(h)$ for $h\in H$, $\bigsqcup_{i\in I} Hg_i=G$).

Let $\mu \in S(l^{\infty}(G))$ be a left invariant mean and define $\tau (f)=\mu ((\pi^*)^{-1}(f))$. I'm not sure if this definition does make sense.. And I guess to define $\tau$ it is necessary that $H$ is amenable as well.. My question is: How to define $\tau$ correctly? (A proof of this fact using the Følner condition is welcome as well) Regards","I want to proof that  for a discrete group $G$ and $H$ a normal subgroup of $G$ the following holds: $G$ and $H$ are amenable $\Rightarrow$ the quotient $G/H$ is amenable (using one of the definitions below). Def: 1) A discrete group $G$ satisfies the Følner condition if for every finite subset $E\subseteq G$ and for every $\epsilon >0$ there exists a non-empty finite set $F\subseteq G$ such that $$\max\limits_{s\in E}\frac{|F\triangle sF|}{|F|}<\epsilon,$$ where $F\triangle sF$ denotes the symmetric difference of the sets $F$ and $sF$. 2) A discrete group $G$ is called amenable if it satisfies the Følner condition. Def: A discrete group $G$ is called amenable if there is a left invariant mean, i.e. there exists a state $\mu\in S(l^{\infty}(G))$ such that $\mu(g\cdot f)=\mu(f)$ for all $g\in G,\; f\in l^{\infty}(G)$ (where $g\cdot f(h)=f(g^{-1}h)$ for all $h\in H$). I have seen a proof of this fact using other definitions of amenability, but I should know a proof of this fact with one of the above stated definitions. And I only consider discrete groups from now (since I know a proof that these definitions are equivalent if $G$ is discrete). Let $G$ be a amenable group and $H$ an normal amenable subgroup ($H$ is automatically amenable if $G$ is amenable since if you have a left invariant mean $\mu\in S(l^{\infty}(G))$ then you can construct a left invariant mean $\mu\circ \iota \in S(l^{\infty}(H))$, where $\iota :l^{\infty}(H)\to l^{\infty}(\bigsqcup_{i\in I} Hg_i)\; f\mapsto f_i$ with $f_i(hg_i)=f(h)$ for $h\in H$, $\bigsqcup_{i\in I} Hg_i=G$).
