Assume AC. For any nonempty poset $(X, \le)$ , if every nonempty chain of $X$ has an upper bound, then there is a maximal element in $X$ . Notations: For a subset $A$ of $X$ , $A'$ denotes the set of strict upper bounds of $A$ . A subset $A$ of a totally ordered set $(S, \le)$ is an initial segment of $S$ if for all $x \in S$ and all $y \in A$ , $x\le y$ implies $x \in A$ . A choice function $c: \powset(X)\setminus \{\emtset\} \to X$ exists such that for all nonempty subset $A$ of $X$ , $c(A) \in A$ by AC. He defined an interesting set: $T$ is the set of chains $C$ in $X$ such that if $D$ is an initial segment of $C$ , and $D \neq C$ , then $c(D')$ is the least element of $C\setminus D$ . The definition of $T$ is clear but the proofs using it make me really confused. Following his proof, I could't really understand some of his statements appearing in the proposition: Lemma A.1.6 Suppose that $C, D \in T$ , and that $C$ is not contained in $D$ . Then, $D$ is an initial segment of $C$ . To show this, he defined the set $$ E = \{ x \in C \cap D ~|~ \text{if $y \in x$, then $y \in C$ iff $y \in D$}\} $$ I could easily show that $E$ is an initial segment of both $C$ and $D$ . Moreover, because $E \subseteq D$ and $\neg C \subseteq D$ , we have $E \neq C$ . Therefore, because $C \in T$ , $c(E')$ is the least element of $C\setminus E$ . There's no problem so far. The confusing point is the following: Suppose $E \neq D$ . Then, $c(E')$ is the least element of $D\setminus E$ . But this implies that $c(E') \in E$ , giving a contradiction. How on earth could $c(E')$ be an element of $E$ ? I can't find any clue of that conclusion. First, $E'$ and $E$ are disjoint and $c(E') \in E'$ by definition. The condition that $c(E')$ is the least element of $C \setminus E$ also does not imply that $c(E') \in E$ . I've been holding this for whole two days. I am sticking to his proof because it seems to use only elementary mathematical notions I can understand for now.","(The post became longer than I expected... but help me) Garling showed 'AC Zorn's lemma' in Theorem 1.9.1 in his book A Course in Mathematical Analysis Volume 1: Foundations and Elementary Real Analysis (2013).

12,"Are all open balls in $\mathcal{C}([0,1])$ uncountable?",Are all open balls in  uncountable?,"\mathcal{C}([0,1])","A while ago I got confused about the cardinality of open balls in metric spaces and erroneously thought all open balls were uncountable. It turns out this is an obvious mistake -  i.e. if $(X,d)$ is a metric space and $|X|\leq\aleph_{0}$ then clearly no subset of $X$ can have cardinality of the continuum. Because all open balls in $(\mathbb{R}^{k},d_{k})$ are uncountable I think I got lazy and just assumed this to be true for all spaces. Since all open sets are unions of open balls then all open sets in $(\mathbb{R}^{k},d_{k})$ are also uncountable. See the question here; Showing all open sets in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ are uncountable - extend to general metric space? Since I was also learning about the space $(\mathcal{C},[0,1])$ the previous question got me wondering whether all open balls of $\mathcal{C}$ , and hence all open sets of $\mathcal{C}$ , are uncountable? I think they are, and so this is my first question . I adapted the proof that worked for $(\mathbb{R}^{k},d_{k})$ , but of course encountered some new issues and the following question Is the cardinality of $\mathcal{C}[0,1]$ the same as the cardinality of $\mathbb{R}$? helped me out, in particular the above question claimed all functions in $\mathcal{C}$ are determined by values in the set $\mathbb{Q}\cap[0,1]$ (think I am happy with this part of the proof), and hence $$|\mathcal{C}|\le|\Bbb R|^{\aleph_0}=(2^{\aleph_0})^{\aleph_0} =2^{\aleph_0\times\aleph_0}=2^{\aleph_0}=|\Bbb R|=\aleph$$ I used this upper bound for $\mathcal{C}$ in my proof, however I used a different argument since I could not easily understand where $|\mathcal{C}|\le|\Bbb R|^{\aleph_0}$ comes from (the rest I understand). Given the above difficulties I tried the following: noting for any two sets $A$ and $B$ that $|A\cap B|\leq |A\times B|=|A|\times|B|$ then $|\mathbb{Q}\times[0,1]|\leq|\mathbb{Q}|\times|[0,1]|=\aleph_{0}\aleph$ must be an upper bound for the number of functions in $\mathcal{C}$ . Since $\aleph_{0}\aleph=\aleph$ then $\mathcal{C}\leq|\mathbb{Q}\times[0,1]|\leq\aleph$ must hold. So my second question is, how is it that $\mathcal{C}$ being determined by values in the set $\mathbb{Q}\cap[0,1]$ implies $|\mathcal{C}|\le|\Bbb R|^{\aleph_0}$ (and hence that $\mathcal{C}\leq\aleph$ ), and is the above alternate method OK as a proof of this? My third question is whether the following proof is correct that all open balls of $\mathcal{C}$ are uncountable? Proof ; Choose a $f\in\mathcal{C}$ and any $\epsilon>0$ and let $B_{d_{\infty},\epsilon}(f)$ and $B'_{d_{\infty},\epsilon}(f)$ be open $d_{\infty}$ -balls about $f$ of, respectively, $\mathcal{C}$ -functions and those $\mathcal{C}$ -functions that are constant functions. The following relationships hold; \begin{align*} B'_{d_{\infty},\epsilon}(f)\subseteq B_{d_{\infty},\epsilon}(f)\subseteq\mathcal{U}(\mathcal{C})\subseteq\mathcal{C} \end{align*} Let $B_{d,\epsilon}(x^{*})\subset\mathbb{R}$ be the open $d$ -ball about $x^{*}:=\text{sup}\{f(t):t\in[0,1]\}$ . Note that any $x\in B_{d,\epsilon}(x^{*})$ can be mapped to a constant function $g(t):\equiv x$ for all $t\in[0,1]$ and hence $|g(t)-x^{*}|=|x-x^{*}|=d(x,x^{*})<\epsilon$ for all $t\in[0,1]$ . Thus we have \begin{align*} d_{\infty}(g,f)&=\text{sup}\{|g(t)-f(t)|:t\in[0,1]\}\\ &=\text{sup}\{|x-f(t)|:t\in[0,1]\}\\ &\leq|x-x^{*}|\\ &=d(x,x^{*})\\ &<\epsilon, \end{align*} which implies $g\in B'_{d_{\infty},\epsilon}(f)$ since $g\in\mathcal{C}$ . Thus $B_{d,\epsilon}(x^{*})\subseteq B'_{d_{\infty},\epsilon}(f)$ . With the above in mind, for all $x\in B_{d,\epsilon}(x^{*})$ define the bijective mapping $\phi(x)\mapsto h_{x}(t)\equiv x$ for all $t\in[0,1]$ so that $\phi:B_{d,\epsilon}(x^{*})\longrightarrow B_{d,\epsilon}(x^{*})\subseteq B'_{d_{\infty},\epsilon}(f)$ holds. We then have $\aleph=|B_{d,\epsilon}(x^{*})|\leq |B'_{d_{\infty},\epsilon}(f)|$ . Furthermore given $\delta: B'_{d_{\infty},\epsilon}(f)\longrightarrow B'_{d_{\infty},\epsilon}(f)$ , $\delta(f)\mapsto f$ is a bijective mapping and $B'_{d_{\infty},\epsilon}(f)\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ where $\mathbb{R}=\phi(\mathbb{R})$ is viewed as the set of all constant functions, then $|B'_{d_{\infty},\epsilon}(f)|\leq|\mathbb{R}|=\aleph$ . Thus we have $\aleph\leq|B'_{d_{\infty},\epsilon}(f)|\leq\aleph$ which implies $|B'_{d_{\infty},\epsilon}(f)|=\aleph$ . Now using the fact that $B'_{d_{\infty},\epsilon}(f)\subseteq B_{d_{\infty},\epsilon}(f)$ and the identity mapping $\delta$ previously defined, we have $|B'_{d_{\infty},\epsilon}(f)|\leq |B_{d_{\infty},\epsilon}(f)|$ . From the previous result that $\aleph=|B'_{d_{\infty},\epsilon}(f)|$ this then implies $\aleph\leq  |B_{d_{\infty},\epsilon}(f)|$ . Due to the density of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ , for any $x\in\mathbb{R}\backslash\mathbb{Q}$ we can construct a sequence of rationals $\{q_{n}\}_{n}$ such that $q_{n}\longrightarrow x$ . By the continuity of any $f\in\mathcal{C}$ we then have $\text{lim}_{n}f(q_{n})=f(\text{lim}_{n}q_{n})=f(x)$ which shows each continuous function on $[0,1]$ is determined by its values on the countable set $\Bbb Q\cap[0,1]$ . Noting for any two sets $A$ and $B$ that $|A\cap B|\leq |A\times B|=|A|\times|B|$ then $|\mathbb{Q}\times[0,1]|\leq|\mathbb{Q}|\times|[0,1]|=\aleph_{0}\aleph$ must be an upper bound for the number of functions in $\mathcal{C}$ . Since we have $\aleph_{0}\aleph=\aleph$ then $\mathcal{C}\leq|\mathbb{Q}\times[0,1]|\leq\aleph$ must hold. Since $\delta:B_{d_{\infty},\epsilon}(f)\longrightarrow B_{d_{\infty},\epsilon}(f)\subseteq\mathcal{C}$ is a bijection then $|B_{d_{\infty},\epsilon}(f)|\leq|\mathcal{C}|=\aleph$ must be true. Thus we have $\aleph\leq|B_{d_{\infty},\epsilon}(f)|\leq\aleph$ and so we conclude $|B_{d_{\infty},\epsilon}(f)|=\aleph$ EDIT: Alternate proof as suggested in comments Choose any $f\in\mathcal{C}$ and $\epsilon>0$ . Then $B_{\epsilon}(f)$ is an open ball in $\mathcal{C}$ . Given that open balls in $\mathcal{C}$ are convex, for any $t\in[0,1]$ and any $g,h\in\mathcal{C}$ we have $tg+(1-t)h:=m_{t}\in B_{\epsilon}(f)$ . Since there is one $m_{t}$ for every $t\in[0,1]$ then $\aleph=|[0,1]|\leq |B_{\epsilon}(f)|\leq|\mathcal{C}|$ . Since $|\mathcal{C}|=\aleph$ this means $B_{\epsilon}(f)=\aleph$ must hold.","A while ago I got confused about the cardinality of open balls in metric spaces and erroneously thought all open balls were uncountable. It turns out this is an obvious mistake -  i.e. if is a metric space and then clearly no subset of can have cardinality of the continuum. Because all open balls in are uncountable I think I got lazy and just assumed this to be true for all spaces. Since all open sets are unions of open balls then all open sets in are also uncountable. See the question here; Showing all open sets in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ are uncountable - extend to general metric space? Since I was also learning about the space the previous question got me wondering whether all open balls of , and hence all open sets of , are uncountable? I think they are, and so this is my first question . I adapted the proof that worked for , but of course encountered some new issues and the following question Is the cardinality of $\mathcal{C}[0,1]$ the same as the cardinality of $\mathbb{R}$? helped me out, in particular the above question claimed all functions in are determined by values in the set (think I am happy with this part of the proof), and hence I used this upper bound for in my proof, however I used a different argument since I could not easily understand where comes from (the rest I understand). Given the above difficulties I tried the following: noting for any two sets and that then must be an upper bound for the number of functions in . Since then must hold. So my second question is, how is it that being determined by values in the set implies (and hence that ), and is the above alternate method OK as a proof of this?

Proof ; Choose a and any and let and be open -balls about of, respectively, -functions and those -functions that are constant functions.

To show that $A$ is uncountable, it suffices to show that $\not \exists$ bijection $f: \mathbb{N} \to A$ . Assume for contradiction that $\exists$ bijection $f: \mathbb{N} \to A$ . Note that $f(0)=(a_0^{(0)},a_1^{(0)},a_2^{(0)},\ldots)$ and that $f(1)=(a_0^{(1)},a_1^{(1)},a_2^{(1)},\ldots)$ This means that $f(K)=(a_0^{(k)},a_1^{(k)},a_3^{(k)},\ldots)$ . So each natural number is mapped to some infinite sequence. To show that $f$ is not surjective, let $b \in A \ni b=(b_0, b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots)$ where $b_k \in A_k \forall k \in \mathbb{N}$ . Since $|A_0| \ge 2, |A_1| \ge 2, |A_2| \ge 2,\ldots,|A_i| \ge i$ , let $b_i \in A_i \not \{a_i^{(i )}\}$ for every $i \in \mathbb{N}$ . So the i-th term of $b$ will be different from the i-th term of $f$ , and hence $b \notin f(\mathbb{N})$ . Thus we have $b \in A \ni f(i) \ne b \forall i \in \mathbb{N}$ . However, this contradicts the premise that $f$ is surjective (i.e. $f(\mathbb{N})=A)$ . Therefore, $A$ is uncountable. b) $\exists N \in \mathbb{N} \ni \forall i > N$ , $|A_i| \ge 2$ . I'm having trouble figuring out what this means. Does this mean $|A_1| \ge 2, |A_2| \ge 2, |A_3| \ge 2, \ldots,|A_n| \ge 2$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ except $n=0$ ? I'm thinking that in this case, the zeroth term of $b$ will be the zeroth term of $f$ , so $f(0)=b$ . But $f$ may not be injective since $f(1)=b$ , but $0 \ne 1$ . So it will essentially be some times countable. c) $\exists N \in \mathbb{N} \ni \forall i > N$ , $|A_i| = 1$ . As $f(K)=(a_0^{(k)},a_1^{(k)},a_3^{(k)},\ldots)$ , where each $a_i^{(k)} \in A_i$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and $|A_n|=1$ . This means that $f$ cannot be surjective since every natural number maps to $b$ . Thus $\prod\limits_{i=0}^n A_n$ is uncountable. However, $\prod\limits_{i=1}^{n}A_n$ is countable since it is finite; that is, $\left|\prod\limits_{i=1}^n A_n\right|=|A_1| \times |A_2| \times |A_3| \times\cdots\times |A_n|=1$ ? d) $\exists N \in \mathbb{N} \ni \forall n > N$ , $|A_n| = 1$ , and $\exists$ injection $f:\mathbb{N} \to A$ . I'm not sure about this. My understanding is that $A$ should infinite since by definition, a set $A$ is infinite if there exists an injection $f: \mathbb{N} \to B$ . Any insight would be appreciated.

19,A few questions about topological spaces,A few questions about topological spaces,,"Statement $1$ : Given a non-constant map $f: (\mathbb R, \tau_{cocountable}) \to (\mathbb R, \tau_{cofinite})$ , show $f$ is continuous iff, for each $y \in \mathbb R$ , the set $f ^{–1}(\{y\})$ is countable Proof of Statement $1$ : Suppose $f$ is continuous. For each $y \in \mathbb R, \ \{y\}$ is $\tau_{cofinite}$ -closed, so $f^{–1}(\{y\})$ must be $\tau_{cocountable}$ -closed ( $\ne \mathbb R$ since $f$ is non-constant), therefore $f^{–1}(\{y\})$ is countable. Suppose now $f^{–1}(\{y\})$ is countable for each $y \in \mathbb R$ . For any closed $K \in (\mathbb R, \tau_{cofinite}), \ K$ is either $\mathbb R$ or finite . Now $f^{–1}(\mathbb R) = \mathbb R$ is $\tau_{cocountable}$ -closed, and if $K$ is finite, then $f^{–1}(K) = \bigcup_{y \in K}f ^{–1}(\{y\})$ is a finite union of countable sets, therefore countable, therefore $\tau_{cocountable}$ -closed again and hence $f$ is continuous. My Questions about the proof above : How does the bolded "" therefore "" above follow? By definition, any(?) subset $X$ in the domain of $f$ is of the form $\mathbb R = X \cup X^c$ where $X^c$ is the countable complement of $X$ . But that makes $\mathbb R$ countable. In the other direction, how does the italicized finite follow? If $K$ is finite, then $\mathbb R = K \cup K^c$ implies $\mathbb R$ is finite. In general, does $\tau_{cocountable}$ contain countable sets and does $\tau_{cofinite}$ contain finite sets? And maybe trivially, how do we know $f^{-1}(\mathbb R) = \mathbb R?$ Question $2$ : Are the following pairs of spaces homeomorphic? (i) $\mathbb Q \cup (0, 1)$ and $\mathbb R \setminus \mathbb Q$ (as subspaces of $(\mathbb R, \tau_{usual}))$ ; (ii) $(\mathbb C, \tau_{disc})$ and $(\mathbb C, \tau_{cocountable})$ ; (iii) a circle with one point removed (in $\mathbb R^2$ with $\tau_{usual}$ ) and $(\mathbb R, \tau_{usual})$ ; (iv) $\mathbb N$ with topology $\{1, 2\}, \{3, 4\}, \{5, 6\}, \{7, 8\}, \ldots$ and all unions of these, and $\mathbb N$ with topology $\{1, 3\}, \{2, 4\}, \{5, 7\}, \{6, 8\}, \{9, 11\}, \{10, 12\}, \ldots$ and all unions of these.

The map $h : \mathbb Q → \mathbb Q$ given by $h(x) = y, h(y) = x, h(z) = z$ when $z \ne x$ or $y$ is routinely checkable to be a homeomorphism. My answers/questions regarding question $2$ above : (i) $\mathbb Q, (0, 1)$ are not compact and so their union is not compact meaning there's no continuous inverse function from $\mathbb Q \cup (0, 1)$ (ii) Any function from a discrete space to an indiscrete space is continuous. Since idenity $i$ is continuous and bijective, $i$ should work here to show homeomorphism (iii) I think this is a special case of Stereographic projection (iv) Any inverse image of an open set in $\mathbb N$ is a union of $2$ -sets. Since the given $2$ -sets are open, their union is open as well. This works in both directions, so a continuous function with its continuous inverse likely exists.

Theorem says: For $p = 4m+1$ equation $s^2 \equiv-1(mod \;p)$ has two solutions $s \in \{1,2,...,p-1\}$ For $p = 2$ equation $s^2 \equiv-1(mod \;p)$ has one solution $p =2$ For $p = 4m+3$ equation $s^2 \equiv-1(mod \;p)$ has no solutions Proof For odd $p$ let's put equivalance relation which identifies element with it's inverse and opposite elment on $\mathbb{Z}_p$ . It means that we have equivalence class in form of: $$\{x, -x, \bar{x}, -\bar{x}\}$$ But it can be shorten. Let's consider these three cases: (1) $x \equiv -x$ - it cannot be satisfied, because $p$ is odd (2) $x \equiv \bar{x} \Leftrightarrow x^2 \equiv 1 \Leftrightarrow x =1 \lor x = p-1$ . It means that equivalence class is a set $\{1, p-1\}$ (3) $x \equiv -\bar{x} \Leftrightarrow x^2 \equiv -1 $ This equation can have no solutions or two different ones: $x_0$ and $p-x_0$ . When it does, the equivalence class is in form of $\{x_0, p - x_0\}$ . Set $\{1,2,...,p-1\}$ has $p-1$ elements and we divided it into four-element equivalence classes (or two-element - according to above).

Due to this fact equation $s^2 \equiv-1(\mod \;p)$ has no solutions. $(*)$ But if we take $p - 1 \equiv 4m$ then we have also additional two-element equivalence class containing solutions of $s^2 \equiv-1(mod \;p)$ which we were looking for. $(**)$ Question section I have a question related to this proof -  I marked by $(*), (**)$ parts in proof to which I have queries.

Keep an ultrafilter $u \subset P(W)$ in mind for the entire proof. Suppose $u$ contains only infinite sets, and there is some co-finite set $A$ not contained in $u$ . Since $u$ is an ultrafilter, $W\setminus A \in u$ , but $W\setminus A$ is finite, which is a contradiction. Suppose $u$ contains all co-finite sets. If possible, let $u$ contain some finite set $B$ . Then, $W\setminus B \notin u$ . However, $B$ is finite $\implies W\setminus B$ is co-finite. This is a contradiction. So, the second double implication, i.e. $\stackrel{2}{\Longleftrightarrow}$ is proved. Now, let us turn to $\stackrel{1}{\Longleftrightarrow}$ . Suppose $u$ contains only infinite sets. If possible, let $u$ be principal. Then there exists some $w\in W$ such that $u = \{X \in P(W): w\in X\}$ . $w\in \{w\}$ , obviously. So, $\{w\} \in u$ , but $\{w\}$ is a finite set. This is a contradiction. Thus, $u$ is non-principal. For the other direction, suppose $u$ is non-principal. Suppose, for a contradiction, that $u$ contains some finite set $C$ . So, $W\setminus C$ is infinite. Also, let $C = \{c_1,c_2,\ldots,c_n\}$ . Stuck here! I want to show that $C\in u$ makes $u$ a principal filter, somehow, in order to find a contradiction. For that, I must find a $w\in W$ so that $\{w\} \in u$ . Correct? Please help me out here. Update for part $\color{red}{(c)}$ : If $u$ is an ultrafilter, we know that $X\cup Y \in u$ if and only if $X\in u$ or $Y\in u$ . $C\in u$ means that $\{c_1,c_2,\ldots,c_{n-1}\} \cup \{c_{n}\} \in u$ . So, either $\{c_1,c_2,\ldots,c_{n-1}\} \in u$ or $\{c_n\}\in u$ . If $\{c_n\} \in u$ , we are done. If not, we can recursively apply the same argument to $\{c_1,\ldots,c_{n-1}\}$ . At every step, we drop an element of this finite set, and so the process terminates. We will be able to find a singleton $\{c_i\}$ so that $\{c_i\}\in u$ .

To explain, consider two polynomials $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ , then we can observe the following analogies: 1.

In Polynomial multiplication $$|P(x)| \cdot |Q(x)|$$ Can be thought of as set union because the above equation is true for the numbers which satisfy either $P$ or $Q$ 3.

Shouldn't his base case start as $(a_1)+a_2$ ? It seems to me the only way of going beyond this sentence is to first make the definition that $(x):=x$ . However, in making this definition, doesn't the base case already solve everything? Because any finite expression of $k$ terms can be lumped together, called $x$ , and then you'd have $(x)+a_{k+1}=x+a_{k+1}$ ...which is the whole point of this proof. Edit: A work around for this seems to be to dictate that this proof only operate on $k\geq 2$ . Because if so: We could say $(a_1+a_2) +a_3=a_1+a_2+a_3$ because by definition, $a_1+a_2+a_3=a_1+(a_2+a_3)$ and then we can invoke the associative property to PROVE . $(a_1+a_2) +a_3=a_1+a_2+a_3$ .

From what I've learned in set theory, $a$ is actually a function with a domain of some subset in $\mathbb N$ and, in this context, a range that is a subset of $\mathbb R$ . Given this, I do not see why at all our initial assumption case of $(a_1+...+a_k) + a_{k+1}=a_1+...+a_k+a_{k+1}$ can be applied to $(a_1+...+a_k)+(a_{k+1}+a_{k+2})$ . In general, the quantity $(a_{k+1}+a_{k+2}) \neq a_{k+1}$ . So how exactly is this step actually being applied? Edit : The only thing I can think to do here is invoke ordinals ; I will explain. Originally, the formal definition of the proof I thought was: $\forall k \in \mathbb N [(a_1+...+a_k)+a_{k+1}=a_1+...+a_{k+1}]$ . However, to get around the issue of $(a_{k+1}+a_{k+2}) \neq a_{k+1}$ , it seems like I should instead write the proof as: $\forall k \in \mathbb N \Big [ \forall a \Big( [\text{func}(a) \land \text{dom}(a) \in \omega \land \text{ran}(a) \subseteq \mathbb R] \rightarrow (a_1+...+a_k)+a_{k+1}=a_1+...+a_{k+1} \Big) \Big]$ In doing this, when I arrive at my assumption case, I assume for some $k$ that: $\forall a \Big( [\text{func}(a) \land \text{dom}(a) \in \omega \land \text{ran}(a) \subseteq \mathbb R] \rightarrow (a_1+...+a_k)+a_{k+1}=a_1+...+a_{k+1} \Big)$ WITH THIS, when we arrive at the situation of: \begin{align} &=(a_1+...+a_k)+(a_{k+1}+a_{k+2}) \\ &\quad \quad \text{since the equation holds for } k \\ &=a_1+...+a_k+(a_{k+1}+a_{k+2}) \\ \end{align} we can use our updated formula to tackle this.

Show that the following are equivalent: $|\mathbb{N}| = \aleph_0\leq |A|$ $|A| = n|A|$ for any $n\geq 2\in \mathbb{N}$ $|A| = \aleph_0 |A|$ I want to show $(1)\Rightarrow (2)\Rightarrow (3)\Rightarrow (1).$ $(1)\Rightarrow (2)$ . Suppose $(1)$ holds. Then there is an injection $f : \mathbb{N}\to A.$ It suffices to show that $|A| = |A| + |A| = |A\times 2| = |A\times \{0\}\cup A\times \{1\}|$ , where $2 = \{0,1\},$ since an inductive argument can be applied to give the required result. So we need to define a bijection $f : A \to A\times 2.$ Let $\mathcal{F} := \{(X,f) : X\subseteq A, f : X\to X\times 2\text{ is a bijection}\}.$ Observe that $\mathcal{F}$ is nonempty because $A$ contains a denumerable subset $X$ , and thus there exists a bijection $f : X\to X\times 2.$ Order the elements of $\mathcal{F}$ by extension. That is, let $(X_1, f_1) \leq (X_2, f_2)$ if $X_1\subseteq X_2$ and $f_2\vert_{X_1} = f_1$ . Let $C = \{(X_i, f_i)\}_{i\in I}$ be a chain in $\mathcal{F}.$ Let $X = \cup_{i\in I} X_i$ and $f : X\to X\times 2$ be defined so that $f(x) = f_i(x),$ where $i\in I$ is so that $x\in X_i.$ Then note that $(X,f)$ is an upper bound for $C,$ and is in $\mathcal{F}.$ So by Zorn's Lemma, $\mathcal{F}$ has a maximal element, say $(Y, g).$ Suppose $|Y| < |A|.$ Then $|A\backslash Y| = |A| - |Y| = |A|.$ So $A\backslash Y$ has a denumerable subset $Z.$ Since $Z$ is denumerable, there is a bijection $h : Z\to Z\times 2.$ Then let $i : Y\cup Z\to (Y\cup Z)\times 2, i(w) = \begin{cases}g(w),&\text{ if $w \in Y$}\\ h(w),&\text{ otherwise }\end{cases}$ Then $(Y,g) < (Y\cup Z, i),$ a contradiction. So $|Y| = |A|.$ Hence $|A| = |Y| = |Y\times 2| = |Y| + |Y| = |A| + |A|,$ as required. $(2)\Rightarrow (3).$ One can find a bijection between $\{1,\cdots, n\}\times A$ and $\{1,\cdots, n+1\}\times A$ for any $n\geq 1$ , since $n|A| = (n+1)|A|$ (indeed $n|A| = |A|$ so $(n+1)|A| = n|A| + |A| = |A| + |A| = |A|$ ). Hence, one can find a bijection between $\{1\}\times A$ and $\mathbb{N}\times A,$ which implies $|A| = |\{1\}\times A| = |\mathbb{N}\times A| = \aleph_0 |A|.$ $(3)\Rightarrow (1).$ If $|A| = \aleph_0 |A|,$ then there is a bijection $f : A \to \mathbb{N}\times A.$ Fix $a \in A$ and let $h : \mathbb{N}\to A, h(b) = f^{-1} (b,a).$ Observe that $h$ is injective because if $b\neq d,$ then since $f^{-1}$ is injective, $h(b) = f^{-1}(b,a) \neq f^{-1}(d, a) = h(d).$ Thus, $\aleph_0 \leq |A|.$ Is this incorrect? Especially $(2)\Rightarrow (3)$ and $(3)\Rightarrow (1).$ Also, WHY is $f$ well-defined in $(1)$ ?

However, this type of notation doesn't work for any relation. Specifically, it only works if the $y$ is unique for any given $x$ . As an example, taking an relation $A=\{ \langle 1,2 \rangle, \langle 1,1 \rangle \}$ , using the notation $A(1) = 2$ and $A(1) = 1$ , we can conclude that $1=2$ , which is an absurd. This notation only works if the relation is a function. So we can define the notation as: $$f(x)=y \leftrightarrow f \text{ is a function } \land \langle x,y \rangle \in f$$ Which is valid. However it would be very interesting if we could define a notation $f(x)$ for any relation, and then prove that it's unique only for functions, and then be able to use it accordingly. A definition like: $$f(x) \leftrightarrow \langle x,y \rangle \in f$$ is not really valid, since y is free but only appears on one side of the definition. We could define it like: $$f(x)_y \leftrightarrow \langle x,y \rangle \in f$$ Which seems valid.

So my question is, is it possible for us to define this type of notation for an arbitrary relation, and then prove that $f(x)=y \leftrightarrow \langle x,y \rangle \in f$ if, and only if, $f$ is a function? Or is it necessary to embed the function status of $f$ in the definition?

To show that $S$ is nonempty, we exhibit a point $x$ in $S .$ We can assume that each $Q_{k}$ contains infinitely many points; otherwise the proof is trivial.

I messed up the definition of a field and a definition of a $\sigma$ -field, as pointed by @YuvalFilmus. Following what was suggested I changed my proof: Suppose $A=(a,b]$ ,then $A^c=(-\infty,a]\bigcup(b,\infty)$ . $(-\infty,a] = \bigcup(a_n,b_n],n\in \mathbb{N}$ , where $b_1=a,b_{i+1}=a_i$ , $(b,\infty)= \bigcup(a_n,b_n],n\in \mathbb{N}$ , where $a_1=b,a_{i+1}=b_i$ .

By a Peano System we mean a set $P$ , a particular element $1$ in $P$ , and a singulary operation $S$ on $P$ such that the following axioms are satisfied. (P1) $1$ is not the successor $S(x)$ of any object $x$ in $P$ . In Symbols: $$(\forall x)(S(x) \neq 1)$$ (P2) Different objects in $P$ have different successors. This can be formulated as follows: $$(\forall x)(\forall y)(x \neq y \Rightarrow S(x) \neq S(y))$$ (P3) Principle of mathematical induction: Any subset of $P$ containing $1$ and closed under $S$ must be identical with $P$ . This can be symbolically rendered as follows: $$(\forall B)([B \subseteq P \land 1 \in B \land (\forall x)(x \in B \Rightarrow S(x) \in B)] \Rightarrow P=B)$$ Such a Peano System will be denoted by the ordered triple (P,S,1): $P$ is called underlying set , $S$ the successor operation , and $1$ the distinguished element .

(P3): begin edit 1 First I assume some subset $B$ of $P$ , such $10 \in B$ and $B$ is closed under $S$ , from this we have that $(\forall x)(x \in B \Rightarrow S(x) \in B)$ But as $10 \in B$ we have that $S(10) \in B$ also, and then $S(S(10)) \in B$ too then $S(S(S(10))) \in B$ ..., from this I think its possible to ""see"" that every integer greater than 9 are in $B$ also. But I think its possible to state this in a better way. For every integer $x$ greater than $9$ which is different from $10$ , we have that $(\exists !y)(x = S(y))$ , thus if $y \neq 10$ , we will have that $(\exists !z)(y = S(z))$ and the same proccess can be repeated until we reach the application of $S$ to $10$ , let $z=10$ , thus we will have $x = S(S(10))$ which in fact is the integer 12, thus we needed to apply $S$ , $x-10$ times to obtain the integer $x$ , then if some $x \in P$ , we know that applying $S$ in $10$ , $x-10$ times will be the same integer, and therefore $x \in B$ because $B$ is closed under $S$ , thus $P \subseteq B$ .
