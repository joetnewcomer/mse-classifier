8,What is this topic (competition questions)?,What is this topic (competition questions)?,,"I discovered the following question by accident, and found it interesting, but I only resolved it by brute force: Problem: Let f: $\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ have the property $(\pi)$ iff they satisfy the equation $$f(s^2 + f(t)) = t + f(s)^2 $$ Determine the family of all functions with the property $(\pi)$. Solution: If we can show $f(0) := y$ to be zero, then letting $t$ run over all real values, with $s = 0$, shows $f(f(x)) = x$ $\forall x \in \mathbb{R}$, from which it is clear that $\mathrm{Id}(x)$ has the property $(\pi)$. Taking $s = 0, t = 0$ shows (1) $f(y) = y^2$. Taking $s = y, t = 0$ shows (2) $f(y^2 + y) = (f(y))^2$, so that substitution from (1) gives (3) $f(y^2 + y) = y^4$. However, letting $s = 0, t = y$ shows (4) $f(y^2) = y + y^2$, so that $f(f(y^2)) = y^4$ by substituting the LHS of (4) in (3) , while letting $s= 0, t = y^2$ shows directly that (5) $f(f(y^2)) = 2y^2$. Equating (4) and (5) says $2y^2 = y^4$, so $y = -\sqrt{2}, 0,$ or $\sqrt{2}.$ Assume $y = \sqrt{2}.$ Letting $t = f(y^2), s = y$ says (6) $f(f(f(y^2)) + y^2) = f(3y^2)$ $ = f(y^2) + (f(y))^2$; but $s = \sqrt{2}y, t = y$ says (7) $f(3y^2) = (f(\sqrt{2}y))^2 + y = (f(y^2))^2 + y$. Since $(f(y))^2 = y^4$, $f(y^2) = y + y^2$, equating the RHS of (6) and (7) leaves $$ f(y^2) + (f(y))^2 = (f(y^2))^2 + y \implies y + y^2 + y^4 = (y^4 + 2y^3 + y^2) + y \implies 2y^3 = 0$$ which is absurd. Assuming $y = - \sqrt{2}$ and setting $s = -\sqrt{2}y, t = y$ in (7) similarly shows that $y \neq - \sqrt{2}.$ We conclude that $f(0) = 0$. That $\forall x \in \mathbb{R} (f(f(x)) = x)$ says that $f(x) = f^{-1}(x);$ this requires that $f$ be one-to-one. Since $f(0) = 0$, we have $t \neq 0 \implies f(t) \neq 0$; we can now show that $f$ is increasing. Pick $x, y \in \mathbb{R}, x < y,$ and set $\delta = y - x.$ By choosing $t = f(x), s = \sqrt{\delta}$, we have $$f(\delta + f(f(x))) = f(\delta + x) = f(x) + f(\sqrt{\delta})^2 \implies f(x + \delta) - f(x) = f(\sqrt{\delta})^2$$ $$\therefore f(y) - f(x) > 0$$ since we established that $f(\sqrt{\delta}) \neq 0$. This proves that $f$ is increasing. Since, in fact, $\mathrm{Id}(x)$ is the only $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ which is both increasing and an involution, this says that $f(x) = x$ is the sole function with the property ($\pi$). So several things: 1) What field(?) of study does this question come from? Is it relevant to quotidian mathematics? 2) This was tricky. It took a lot of messing around with various combinations to get the main result, and I had the uncomfortable feeling that I was being inefficient. (I filled up a page and a half of notebook!)

Paraphrasing, the axioms of natural numbers let us define sequences recursively. Suppose we want to build a sequence $a_0, a_1, a_2, ...$ by first defining $a_0 := c$ and then letting $a_1 := f_0(a_0)$, then $a_2 := f_1(a_1)$, etc. In general $a_{n++} := f_n(a_n)$. Now he claims that this procedure gives a single value to the sequence element $a_n$, i.e. there is a unique function $a(n)$ from $N$ to $N$ such that $a(0) = c$ and $a(n\text{++}) = f_n(a(n))$ for each natural number $n$. Proof: Induction. $a_0 := c$ as a base case (which does not get redefined by anything else since $n\text{++}$ cannot be $0$ by Peano's third axiom). Then suppose inductively the procedure gives a single value to $a_n$. Then it gives a single value to $a_{n++} := f_n(a_n)$, which does not get redefined anywhere due to the successor function being injective.
