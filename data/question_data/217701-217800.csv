7,Proving $n\sin(\frac{\pi}{n})<\pi<n\tan(\frac{\pi}{n})$ ; obtaining results from it.,Proving  ; obtaining results from it.,n\sin(\frac{\pi}{n})<\pi<n\tan(\frac{\pi}{n}),"I was reading The Simpsons and the Mathematical Secrets when I encountered the story of $\pi$. It mentions how Archimedes devised a method to place a lower and upper bound on $\pi$ by bounding a circle of diameter $1$ inside a square and making a square in it. And I also read how the subsequent mathematicians made even more contributions by employing this technique and making polygons of 4 billion billion sides! I just tried to verify it for $4,6$ sides. Then I got the idea for $96$ sides. But I encountered this: First, lets find the perimeter of the inner polygon. (inscribed). So first to find each side, we divide the polygon in triangles and make their altitudes/medians. (The polygon is regular , so triangle will be isosceles and base altitudes and medians will coincide). So each angle in the right triangle would be $\frac{2\pi}{2*96}=\frac{\pi}{96}$. Now we know that the hypotenuse of each triangle will be equal to radius $=\frac12$. So we get that each side of polygon will be double the side of the right triangles we divided. So we get that each side $=2*\frac{\sin{\frac{\pi}{96}}}{2}=\sin{\frac{\pi}{96}}$. And thus the perimeter is equal to $96\sin{\frac\pi{96}}$. Now at this point, two question arose in my mind: How did the mathematicians found the values of these sine expressions ($\sin{\frac\pi{96}}$)? ( Please don't tell me that series expansions were used because they give approximate results and that too is not necessary ) Can we generalize this to $n$ side polygons (Obviously, for $n\geq 3$ ) and get $n\sin\frac\pi{n}<\pi$? Now, quite intrigued, I proceeded forward and tried to find the perimeter of the bigger polygon. This time I got $96\tan\frac{\pi}{96}$ as the perimeter and thus got the inequality: $$\boxed{n\sin\frac\pi n<\pi<n\tan\frac\pi n}$$ Is it a valid result? Is it have a different, more algebraic proof? Now lets experiment with the inequality. (For $n$ is the no. of sides of a polygon) We get $\sin\frac\pi n<\frac\pi n$ and $\frac\pi n<\tan\frac\pi n$. We divide all sides by $n\sin\frac\pi n$, and square all sides, then subtract $1$ from all sides and again square root to get: $$0<\sqrt{\frac{\pi^2}{n^2\sin^2\frac\pi n}-1}<\tan\frac\pi n$$  Are these of some use? Is this scribbling even correct? If someone can even tell if this has been used as a theorem or result or lemma etc before, it would be helpful.","I was reading The Simpsons and the Mathematical Secrets when I encountered the story of $\pi$.

So far I've learned how to find the parametric equations for a straight line, I know about replacing $x^2$ and $y^2$ in the equation of the unit circle, but I'm having trouble with this particular problem. Note that this seems to be a popular problem, there are solutions to it plastered over the Internet, including on StackExchange, but the explanations are not in-depth enough for a newbie of my calibre of the process behind these solutions, that's what I'm struggling with. The question is as follows: “Find parametric equations for the path of a particle that moves halfway around the circle $x2 + (y – 1)2 = 4$ counter-clockwise, starting at the point (0 , 3).” Here is a screenshot of the graph: https://i.sstatic.net/lUX7V.png Could somebody please help me out?",,"['calculus', 'algebra-precalculus', 'trigonometry']"

Much much much much much more. It's extremely longer (at least it was the way I went about it), after a long excruciating amount of time, I had gotten my final result, which needed simplifying. Here it is without simplying:  $$ I = \frac{1}{2}e^x(\sin(x)+\cos(x))-\frac{1}{2}(I + \frac{1}{2}e^x(x+\frac{1}{2}\sin(2x))-\frac{1}{2}(xe^x-e^x)+\frac{1}{20}e^x(\sin(2x)-2\cos(2x))) + C $$ and here is what I got after attempting to simplify it, keep in mind I'm not even sure if this is correct.  $$ 20I =e^x(10(\sin(x)+\cos(x)-x+\frac{5}{4}(\sin(2x) -x)) +\sin(2x)-2\cos(x)) - \frac{I}{2} +C$$ I really hope I didn't mess it up too much, if I've made a mistake in any of the things I've posted, please call me out on it. I didn't know what else to do after I tried to simplfy it, I know this is a lot to ask, and I'm sure you have better things to do, but just if by chance of a miracle, you feel like simplifying an extremely long equation, please, it would be really appreciated, and if not, then thank you for reading this far anyway.
