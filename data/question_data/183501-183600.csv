Idea 1 (Which I think is incorrect) Define $f$ such that $f(x) = ((x, i))_{i \in \mathbb{Z_+}}$ The idea here was to define a function for a specific $x \in \mathbb{Z_+}$ and have the function range over all $i \in \mathbb{Z_+}$, which as I thought would define a surjective function from $\mathbb{Z_+}$ to $\mathbb{Z_+} \times \mathbb{Z_+}$ Idea 2 Define $f$ such that $f(x) = ((x, y))_{y\ \leq \ x}$ and $y \in \mathbb{Z_+}$. The idea here, was to use a sort of diagonolisation argument to define a surjective function. In this case $f(3) = \{(3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)\}$ (or at least that's what I'm hoping the function would produce) Are either of the functions I defined surjective? Are they even correct?

If we look at conditions for increasing, decreasing and stable states of a function, for a function $f(x)$ : function is increasing for $f'(x) > 0$ function is decreasing for $f'(x) < 0$ (as per my knowledge) function is neither increasing nor decreasing (i.e. it's stable) for $f'(x) = 0$ so for $x = 0$ , function $f(x) = x^3$ should be stable, NOT INCREASING.

Redfining the map in more general terms: $$ X,Y \subseteq  \mathbb{R} \,\, | \,\, f: X \rightarrow Y $$ I first sought to investigate how this mapping fails to be injective. Knowing the definition of injectivity, I immediately see that there exists more than one possible inverse value for every value of the range. In other words, I can draw a line of constant $y$ on the graph of this function and strike the function more than one time, and in fact infinitely many times as $x$ is allowed to run to infinity. This leads me to believe I need to put a restriction involving the periodicity of $\sin(x)$ on the domain for sure. Secondly, I checked how the mapping fails to be surjective. I know the domain runs from negative infinity to infinity, whereas the range only runs from $-1$ to $1$. Surjectivity requires that for every $ y \in Y $, there exists at least one $ x \in X$ such that $ f(x) = y$. If $ Y$ is the entire real line and the range of $f$ is $[-1,1]$, then any $y$ outside of that interval will fail to have an inverse image, which contradicts surjectivity.(?) To achieve injectivity, I considered the fact that $sin(x)$ is periodic, with a first maximum at $\frac{\pi}{2}$. Immediately after that, we start seeing repeated $y$ values for different $x$ values. I also noticed that we can extend this towards negative $x$ out to the same value. For surjectivity, and thus bijectivity, I noted that we need every value in both the domain and range to be utilized in the mapping. We explicitly have the required range. Using the aforementioned reasoning, I conclude that the mapping with restrictions should look like this: $$ X = [-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}] \,\, , \,\, Y = [-1,1]$$ $$ f: X \rightarrow Y \,\, | \,\, f: x \mapsto \sin(x) $$ Is all that rationale provided above sufficient to make this map bijective?","I'm working out of the Nakahara text in mathematical physics, and I'm presented with a map $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ defined by $ f:x \mapsto \sin(x) $, and told that it is neither injective nor surjective, and to restrict the domain and range to make the mapping bijective.

89,left inverse is not equal to right inverse [duplicate],left inverse is not equal to right inverse [duplicate],,This question already has an answer here : Right and left inverse (1 answer) Closed 10 years ago . Is it possible to have a function which has both left and right inverse but they are unequal ? A left inverse means the function should be one-to-one whereas a right inverse means the function should be onto. How can both of these conditions be valid simultaneously without being equal ? An example will be really helpful. Thanks in advance,This question already has an answer here : Right and left inverse (1 answer) Closed 10 years ago .
