3,How many essentially different Drive Ya Nuts Puzzles exist?,How many essentially different Drive Ya Nuts Puzzles exist?,,"In the Drive Ya Nuts puzzle, we are given $7$ hexagonal nuts, whose edges have been numbered from $1$ to $6$ .  Each nut uses all $6$ numbers.  The aim of the puzzle is to place all the nuts in a hexagonal grid, so that touch sides are numbered the same.  In the marketed puzzle, there is a unique solution, provided that solutions arising from rotations of the entires grid are regarded as identical.  (This is easy to confirm.  There are only $7$ ways to place the nuts in the grid, and since rotations don't matter, we can assume the central hexagon has the $1$ on the north.  There is then only one possible orientation for each of the outer hexagons, and we just have to check if they lead to a solution.) I wonder how many possible puzzles of this type have the attractive property of having a unique solution.  That is, how many sets  of $7$ different numbered hexagons  give a puzzle with a unique solution?  We can represent a hexagon by listing it numbers in clockwise order.  Since rotating a nut gives the same nut, we always start with the $1$ .  Also, since permuting all the labels does not essentially change the puzzle, we may assume that $123456$ , which I will call the ""unit"", for want of a better term, is always one of the nuts. I'm confident that I can find all such essentially different sets.  We may assume that the central hexagon is the unit, oriented with $1$ on top.  Now if we look at the $6$ edges radiating out from vertices of the unit, each is constrained to have one of $4$ possible labels, or we would have a hexagon with two sides labeled the same. For the same reason, no two consecutive ""spokes"" can have the same label.  Brute force calculation shows there are $1144$ possible labelings.  Once we have such a labeling, each of the outer hexagons has $3$ unlabeled sides, which may be labeled in $3!$ ways, so we have $$1144\cdot6^6=53,373,464$$ positions with at least one solution.  Many of these will be relabelings of other such positions, so by generating the positions, keeping track of the ones seen, and rejecting isomorphs, I think testing them all will be quite feasible.  (Obviously, I will use backtrack rather than generating all $5040$ positions.) My problem is relating this answer to the number of possible puzzles.  The possible number of nuts is $5!$ =120, so the possible number of nut sets is $${119\choose6}=3,470,108,187$$ However, this ignores the, fact that some of these are just relabelings of others.  We are only interested in permutations of the numbers that result in a set containing the unit.  If we pick any of the nuts, we can replace any of its labels by $1$ , the next label in clockwise order by $2$ , and so on.  This gives $42$ possible permutations for a given nut set. My problem is figuring out what nut sets are invariant under which permutations.  By what has gone before, the only permutations that might leave a nut set invariant are $6$ -cycles or $5$ -cycles.  My instinct is that no $5$ -cycle will work, but I don't know how to prove it.  Part of what confuses me is that we have to take account of the canonical forms.  Let us apply the permutation $$\sigma={1\,2\,3\,4\,5\,6\choose2\,3\,4\,5\,6\,1}$$ to the hexagon $\tau=132465$ .  We get successively $$\begin{align}\tau&=132465\\ \sigma\tau&=243516\\ \sigma^2\tau&=354321\\ \sigma^3\tau&=465132 \end{align}$$ Notice that $\sigma^3\tau$ is just a rotation of $\tau$ , so $\sigma^3\tau=\tau.$ I've thought of Polya's theory of counting, of course, but I can't see how to apply it.  I feel that there is probably a simple way of attacking this problem, but I just don't see it.  Alternatively, am I making things difficult by requiring that the unit be part of the set?  Would it somehow be easier to remove this requirement? I can of course, compute the orbits of all $5$ - and $6$ -cycles Any direction or assistance will be appreciated. EDIT I can prove that no $5$ -cycle leaves any nut set invariant. The length of an orbit must divide the order of a cycle, so that the orbits of a $5$ -cycle $\sigma$ have length $1$ or $5$ .  If an orbit has length $1$ , say $\tau=\sigma\tau$ then $\sigma$ rotates $\tau$ , but this is impossible, since $\sigma$ leaves an element fixed.

9,Morphing Hypercubes and Odd Permutations,Morphing Hypercubes and Odd Permutations,,"Let $Q_n$ denote the $n$ -dimensional hypercube graph and let $H$ denote a subgraph of $Q_n$ that is isomorphic to $Q_{n'}$ , for some input parameter $n' \leq n$ (i.e. $H$ is an $n'$ -dimensional subcube of $Q_n$ ). Next, I would like to partition $H$ into $2^{n' - d}$ vertex disjoint subgraphs $H_1, \ldots, H_{2^{n'-d}}$ each isomorphic to $Q_d$ where $d \leq n'$ . We can think of each $H_i$ as a ternary string $s_i \in \{0, 1, *\}^n$ such that $s_i$ has exactly $d$ $*$ 's. These represent free coordinates. For each $s_i$ , we define a mapping $f_i : \{0, 1, *\}^n \to \{0, 1, *\}^n$ such that the $j$ -th coordinate of $f_i(s_i)$ is a $*$ if and only if the $j$ -th coordinate of $s_i$ is a $*$ . So intuitively, each $f_i$ maps a $d$ -dimensional subcube to another $d$ -dimensional subcube on the same axes. Let $H'$ denote the subgraph obtained by decomposing $H$ as described above and applying the $f_i$ 's on its $2^{n'-d}$ pieces. If $H'$ is also isomorphic to $Q_{n'}$ , then I call $H'$ a ""morph"" of $H$ . So my question is the following. Given $H$ , I would like to apply a sequence of ""morph"" operations to obtain a graph $H''$ that ""finishes where $H$ started"". By this, I mean that the ternary string that represents $H$ must be the same as $H''$ . However, if we look at the placement of the vertices in $H$ and $H''$ , I want them to induce an odd permutation. To make things clearer, let's look at a small example. Let $H$ denote a subgraph isomorphic to $Q_2$ in $Q_3$ . In my example, I will take $H$ to be the graph induced by the vertices with labels $\{A=000, B=001, C=010, D=011\}$ (i.e. the $0**$ face of $Q_3$ ). Now, consider the following 3 morph operations when $d=1$ : 1) Partition $\{A,B,C,D\}$ into pairs $\{A,B\}$ and $\{C, D\}$ . These can be represented by ternary strings $00*$ and $01*$ respectively.We morph $00* \to 11*$ and leave $01*$ unchanged. This gives us a new graph isomorphic to $Q_2$ with vertices $\{A = 110, B = 111, C = 010, D = 011\}$ . Note that $C$ and $D$ are unchaged from before. This new square doesn't have the same ""orientation"" as the first, since it has ternary string $*1*$ . 2) Next, partition the newly obtained $*1*$ into $*10$ and $*11$ and we morph $*10 \to *01$ to obtain the square $**1$ with labels $\{A = 101, B = 111, C = 001, D = 011\}$ . This also doesn't have the same ""orientation"" as $H$ . 3) Finally, we partition the obtained $**1$ into $1*1$ and $0*1$ and morph $1*1 \to 0*0$ . This gives us our graph $H''$ induced by the square $0**$ (just as it was with $H$ ). However, if we look at the new label placements, we see that we have $\{A = 000, B = 010, C = 001, D=011\}$ . And if we look at the permutation induced by $A,B,C,D$ , we see that: $A$ went from $000$ to $000$ , $B$ from $001$ to $010$ , $C$ went from $010$ to $001$ and $D$ went from $011$ to $011$ . This permutation is an odd permutation as needed. So now I am interested in the case when $d=2$ .

For each , we define a mapping such that the -th coordinate of is a if and only if the -th coordinate of is a . So intuitively, each maps a -dimensional subcube to another -dimensional subcube on the same axes. Let denote the subgraph obtained by decomposing as described above and applying the 's on its pieces. If is also isomorphic to , then I call a ""morph"" of . So my question is the following. Given , I would like to apply a sequence of ""morph"" operations to obtain a graph that ""finishes where started"". By this, I mean that the ternary string that represents must be the same as . However, if we look at the placement of the vertices in and , I want them to induce an odd permutation. To make things clearer, let's look at a small example. Let denote a subgraph isomorphic to in . In my example, I will take to be the graph induced by the vertices with labels (i.e. the face of ). Now, consider the following 3 morph operations when : 1) Partition into pairs and . These can be represented by ternary strings and respectively.We morph and leave unchanged. This gives us a new graph isomorphic to with vertices . Note that and are unchaged from before. This new square doesn't have the same ""orientation"" as the first, since it has ternary string . 2) Next, partition the newly obtained into and and we morph to obtain the square with labels .

17,Is a perfect game of Set always possible?,Is a perfect game of Set always possible?,,"For anyone not familiar with the game of Set, I'll refer you to the description on this question . My question is this: The game ends when there are no more cards remaining in the deck and there are no sets visible on the table.  I will define a ""Perfect Game"" as one in which there are no cards at all on the table at the end, i.e. all 81 cards have been removed as part of a set.  Can any ordering of cards result in a Perfect Game? Now, in practice, this is a fairly rare occurrence.  Games typically end with 6, 9, or 12 cards remaining.  They can even end with as many as 15 (this seems to be even less common than a 0-card ending, but I have seen it happen). 18+ I believe to be impossible.  I think that 16 is the maximum number of cards that can be showing without making a set, and there must always be a multiple of 3, so that rules out anything > 15. (Edit: Apparently up to 18 is possible.)  A 3-card ending is also impossible, per the question I linked above.  (The last 3 must form a set, so this would result in a Perfect Game.) Now, in a normal game, there are often times where more than one set is visible, and which one you pick can affect the outcome of the game at the end, and you have no way of knowing what those outcomes would be.  But let's say that we are given full knowledge ahead of time about the exact order of cards in the deck.

18,The $n$-astrolabacus sequence.,The -astrolabacus sequence.,n,"The Details: The astrolabacus is a puzzle said to have $$A_3:=\frac{18!\times 2^{18}}{3!^6}=35,972,733,468,672,000$$ possible positions. Here is a GIF of the puzzle moving: There are six segments that each contain six coloured balls: three per coloured half segment. Those segments can be moved as above and there are loops of $18$ balls that one can slide into different positions. There are four colours, like so: A solution to the puzzle is described here . Definition 1: The $n$ -astrolabacus is an astrolabacus where, instead of $3$ balls per half segment, there are $n$ balls. Let $A_n$ be the number of different positions of the $n$ -astrolabacus. The Question: What is $A_n$ in terms of $n\in\Bbb N$ ? This sequence is not in the OEIS. My Attempt: Well, when $n=3$ , quoting this article , we have that [t]he puzzle is symmetrical, and remains so even when it changes its shape ( $180$ degree rotational symmetry around a central axis). The balls therefore occur in pairs which remain opposite each other. There are four colours (red, blue, green, yellow), and the tunnels are coloured in such a way that every pair occurs exactly once. There are $18$ pairs coloured balls (sic) which can be permuted in $18!$ ways. The balls of a pair can also be swapped, so there are (at most) $18!\times 2^{18}$ ways to arrange them all.

Those segments can be moved as above and there are loops of balls that one can slide into different positions. There are four colours, like so: A solution to the puzzle is described here .

Motivation The English word 'buffalo' has several definitions: ( noun ) any of several wild bovids: such as water buffalo or cape buffalo, or [long sciencey definition] ( verb, transitive ) see also: bewilder, baffle, bamboozle ['intimidates' is also a common] ( proper noun ) A city in New York. ( adjective ) A demonym for something from Buffalo, New York. The first three are directly from Merriam-Webster; the last one I actually can't find a reputable source for, but I've picked it up by cultural osmosis. This has led to the observation that, ignoring capitalization, you can put any number $n$ of copies of the word 'buffalo' to make a valid English sentence. (or, to use the internal source ...) Examples The usual example here is the $n=8$ case, which is usually capitalized Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo. and means The New York bovids that New York bovids intimidate, themselves intimdate New York bovids. However, $n=8$ can also be capitalized differently: Buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo which means New York boivds intimidate the New York bovids that New York bovids intimidate. This is not only a different grammatical parsing, but is in fact a different semantic meaning. In the second sentence, there could be three groups of bovids, one of which is intimidated by the other two. This is impossible with the first sentence— if there are three groups of bovids, they intimidate each other sequentially. There is yet another interpretation: Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo. which can mean The bovids that bovids intimidate, themselves intimidate the New York bovids that bovids intimidate. This sentence is clearly different, since there could be as many as four groups of bovids, and only one of them need be from New York. However, this is not what I meant when I wrote the sentence. I meant that The New York bovids— namely, those that the bovids who intimidate New York (!) do intimidate— intimidate bovids. This is also trivially different from any of the other sentences above; never before have we encountered bovids that intimidate an entire city! This example shows that even with the same capitalization, we can get different semantic meaning.

Caveats and Variations The Wikipedia page that I cited above permits the sentence ""Buffalo."", a command meaning ""Hey, you! Intimidate them!"". English permits this kind of obnoxiousness, where you have both an implied subject by using the imperative mood, and an implied direct object for a transitive verb. Such sentences should be allowed by this count, but I wouldn't mind too much if you removed this restriction. ""Buffalo buffalo buffalo?"" either means either ""Do bovids actually intimidate other bovids?"" (i.e., a reasonable complaint about this entire setup) or ""Do New York bovids actually intimidate things?"". These are both different from the plausible meanings of ""Buffalo buffalo buffalo."" ""Buffalo, buffalo buffalo."" is another possibility (in the imperative mood) but with different punctuation, in which the governor of New York is suggesting that the city should intimidate the bovids in their midst, perhaps to avoid having to come up with ways to describe these unlikely scenarios. Such sentences should not be allowed by this count, but I would be impressed if you had a method of counting under which it was easier to count them. I would be rather surprised if there is a nice answer to this question which doesn't essentially give a generating function (on how many copies of each buffalo definition are being used) and certainly wouldn't mind if you expressed the answer in that language.

Bovids intimidate things.

Now, for simple functions like $f(x)=x$, I can show that  $$\sum_{S_k} D_{s_k} = \sum_{S_k} k\langle X\rangle = \binom{n}{k}k\langle X \rangle$$ and similarly for $f(x)=x^2$ I can show that $\sum_{S_k} D_{s_k}^2 = \binom{n}{k}\times\left((k\langle X \rangle)^2 + k (\langle X^2 \rangle - \langle X \rangle^2)\right)$.

I tried many ways to prove this equation but I only know the proof of the integer case using group theoretic counting arguments and it is not easy to use them for polynomials.

It is linked to the hyperoval notion in projective plane : indeed, if you add a ''infinite line"" with $q+1$ points, each of them corresponding to a direction and you join the lines of the same direction to the corresponding point, you obtain $PG(2,q)$. A set of $q+2$ points with no three points on the same line in $PG(2,q)$ is an hyperoval and exists, but I don't know if the points can be 2 by 2 equals to the same vector...

53,Proof for an identity involving a sum of binomial coefficients,Proof for an identity involving a sum of binomial coefficients,,"I am moving through a On The Average Height of Planted Plane Trees by Knuth, de Bruijn and Rice, 1972), and I would like to trade a weaker result for simpler mathematical tools, because my skills are not up for the task. I would simply like to prove  that the average height $h_n$ of a tree with $n$ nodes (i.e. the maximum number of nodes from the root to a leaf) satisfies $h_n \sim \sqrt{\pi n}$. The outline from the article is as follows and may be skipped. Let $A_{nh}$ be the number of trees with height less than or equal to $h$ (with the convention $A_{nh} = A_{nn}$ for all $h \geqslant n$) and $B_{nh}$ the number of trees of $n$ nodes with height greater than or equal to $h+1$ (that is, $B_{nh} = A_{nn} - A_{nh}$). Then $h_n = S_n/A_{nn}$, where $S_n$ is the finite sum $$ S_n = \sum_{h \geqslant 1} h(A_{nh} - A_{n,h-1}) = \sum_{h \geqslant 1} h(B_{n,h-1} - B_{nh}) = \sum_{h \geqslant 0} B_{nh}. $$ It is well known that $A_{nn} = \frac{1}{n}\binom{2n-2}{n-1}$, for the set of general trees with $n$ nodes is in bijection with the set of binary trees with $n-1$ nodes, counted by the Catalan numbers.

58,Improvement on the concept of separating families for the union-closed sets conjecture?,Improvement on the concept of separating families for the union-closed sets conjecture?,,"The union-closed sets conjecture states the following. Let $F$ be a finite family of finite sets that is union-closed and let $\cup (F)$ be the union of all sets in $F$ . Then we can find an element in $\cup (F)$ that appears in at least half of the sets in $F$ . One can show that w.l.o.g. we can assume $F$ to be separating, that is for any two elements in $\cup (F)$ we can find a set in $F$ that contains exactly one of the two elements. So in the literature many statements concerning the conjecture are proven for separating families. However we can do better. Say a family $F$ is given. We now chose an element in $\cup (F)$ and remove it from every set in $F$ if the number of sets doesn't decrease by doing so. We repeat this process as long as we can. After that we obtain a family $\tilde{F}$ with the following property. For every $x \in \cup(\tilde{F})$ we can find $S \in \tilde{F}$ such that $x \in S$ and $S\backslash \{x\} \in \tilde{F}$ . We call families with this property minimal. It is easy to see that if $\tilde{F}$ fulfills the conjecture then so does $F$ . Thus w.l.o.g. we can assume $F$ to be minimal. Now we make the observation that being separating is strictly weaker than being minimal. Say $F$ is a minimal family and let $x, y \in \cup (F)$ . Then we can find $S \in \cup (F)$ such that $x \in S$ and $S\backslash \{x\} \in F$ . If $y \notin S$ then $S$ contains exactly $x$ and if $y \in S$ then $S\backslash \{x\}$ contains exactly $y$ . Thus $F$ is separating. Now consider the family $\{\emptyset, \{1,2\},\{2,3\},\{1,2,3\} \}$ . One can easily check that it is separating but not minimal. This leaves me with the following questions: Is there any literature about the union-closed sets conjecture  that introduces a concept like minimal families? If not, is an inductive proof for the union-closed sets conjecture plausible abusing minimal families (reduce the number of sets in a minimal family by removing an arbitrary element from all sets)?
