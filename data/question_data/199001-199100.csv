Question Can two different regions of the same global spacetime manifold share the same coordinates? Sorry for the lack of rigor, I am not a mathematician. If any clarification or additional conditions are required, I would be happy to provide. Please do not hesitate to ask. Thanks for your expert insight! EDIT - Based on comments, below is a clarification on the terminology used in the question. Nothing new here, just some optional background for clarity. Schwarzschild The Schwarzschild spacetime is a pseudo-Riemanian manifold defined by the following metric in polar coordinates: $$ -{d \tau}^{2} = -\left(1 - \frac{r_\mathrm{s}}{r} \right) \,dt^2 + \left(1-\frac{r_\mathrm{s}}{r}\right)^{-1} \,dr^2 + r^2 d\Theta^2 $$ Where $d\Theta^2$ denotes the spherical metric induced by the Euclidean on a two sphere, i.e. $$ d\Theta^2 = d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta \, d\varphi^2\;\;\; \text{and} \;\;\; r=\sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2} $$ Here $r=r_s$ is a sphere of the event horizon , a coordinate singularity where the temporal part of the metric is zero while the spatial part radially diverges. The Schwarzschild metric accurately describes the gravitational field outside an uncharged non-rotating spherical object, such as a planet, star, black hole (or a hollow spherical shell in this question). By extending this metric through the horizon, we notice that $t$ becomes spacelike while $r$ becomes timelike on the inside. This extension is the mainstream interpretation of the spacetime geometry inside an uncharged non-rotating black hole. It is easy to see that a timeslice inside the horizon in the Schwarzschild coordinates is a spherinder rapidly shrnking in time $r$ to its axis (along $t$ ) called the Schwarzschild singularity, an infinite line $(r=0,-\infty<t<+\infty)$ removed from the spacetime manifold: Is the Schwarzschild singularity stretched in space as a straight line? In this question, in the Case A, the Schwarzschild metric applies both outside and inside the horizon; in the Case B, this metric applies only outside of the massive spherical shell. Minkowski The Minkowski spacetime in a hollow massive shell is a flat pseudo-Euclidean manifold defined by the following metric (where $t\equiv x_0$ ): $$ -{d \tau}^{2} = -H\, dx_0^2 + dx_1^2 + dx_2 + dx_3^2 $$ or in polar coordinates: $$ -{d\tau}^2=-H\,dt^2+dr^2+r^2d\Theta^2 $$ See Weinberg, ""Gravitation and Cosmology"", p. 337 where $H$ is denoted as $f(t)$ . Here $H$ defines the time dilation (squared) and can be renormalized to unity in the coordinates inside the shell, but not in the Schwarzschild coordinates, because $dt$ must be continuous through the shell (the same time dilation inside as at the shell): $$ H=1-\dfrac{r_s}{R} $$ where $R$ represents the radius of the massive shell, so the time dilation is the same anywhere inside the shell, at any radial coordinate $r$ . See: On a Common Misunderstanding of the Birkhoff Theorem where $H$ is denoted as $h(t)$ . In this question, this metric applies to the Case B inside the massive spherical shell while the shell is larger than the horizon $r>r_s$ (which is forever in the Schwarzschild coordinates).","Despite referring to physics, this question is purely mathematical on geometry and topology of the given pseudo-Riemannian manifold.

The Schwarzschild metric accurately describes the gravitational field outside an uncharged non-rotating spherical object, such as a planet, star, black hole (or a hollow spherical shell in this question). By extending this metric through the horizon, we notice that becomes spacelike while becomes timelike on the inside. This extension is the mainstream interpretation of the spacetime geometry inside an uncharged non-rotating black hole. It is easy to see that a timeslice inside the horizon in the Schwarzschild coordinates is a spherinder rapidly shrnking in time to its axis (along ) called the Schwarzschild singularity, an infinite line removed from the spacetime manifold: Is the Schwarzschild singularity stretched in space as a straight line? In this question, in the Case A, the Schwarzschild metric applies both outside and inside the horizon; in the Case B, this metric applies only outside of the massive spherical shell. Minkowski The Minkowski spacetime in a hollow massive shell is a flat pseudo-Euclidean manifold defined by the following metric (where ): or in polar coordinates: See Weinberg, ""Gravitation and Cosmology"", p. 337 where is denoted as . Here defines the time dilation (squared) and can be renormalized to unity in the coordinates inside the shell, but not in the Schwarzschild coordinates, because must be continuous through the shell (the same time dilation inside as at the shell): where represents the radius of the massive shell, so the time dilation is the same anywhere inside the shell, at any radial coordinate . See: On a Common Misunderstanding of the Birkhoff Theorem where is denoted as . In this question, this metric applies to the Case B inside the massive spherical shell while the shell is larger than the horizon (which is forever in the Schwarzschild coordinates).","t,r,\phi,\theta  -{d \tau}^{2} = -\left(1 - \frac{r_\mathrm{s}}{r} \right) \,dt^2 + \left(1-\frac{r_\mathrm{s}}{r}\right)^{-1} \,dr^2 + r^2 d\Theta^2  d\Theta^2  d\Theta^2 = d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta \, d\varphi^2\;\;\; \text{and} \;\;\; r=\sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2}  r=r_s t r r t (r=0,-\infty<t<+\infty) t\equiv x_0  -{d \tau}^{2} = -H\, dx_0^2 + dx_1^2 + dx_2 + dx_3^2   -{d\tau}^2=-H\,dt^2+dr^2+r^2d\Theta^2  H f(t) H dt  H=1-\dfrac{r_s}{R}  R r H h(t) r>r_s","['differential-geometry', 'metric-spaces']"

17,Statistical distance induced by Fisher information metric on statistical manifold of categorical distribution (simplex),Statistical distance induced by Fisher information metric on statistical manifold of categorical distribution (simplex),,"I am trying to compute the information length or distance induced by the Fisher information metric on the statistical manifold of the categorical distribution (the interior of the n-dimensional simplex). I have checked each part of my computation several times. However, the result I obtain is dependent on my original choice of chart. How is this possible? Changing how the computation is done, I obtain a result consistent with another method, which I discuss at the end. However, inspection reveals that there are problems associated with that as well. How can I adapt the derivation to get the correct expression for the information distance? Here, I summarise my computation of the information distance: Suppose there are n+1 possible outcomes. Let $\mathring \Delta^n =  \{x=(x_0, ..., x_n) \in \mathbb R^{n+1}\:|\: x_i > 0, \sum_i x_i  =1\}$ , be the statistical manifold of the categorical distribution in this case. We choose the chart $ \psi: \mathring \Delta^n \to Im(\psi) =:U \subset \mathbb R^n : (x_0, ..., x_n) \mapsto (x_1, ..., x_n)$ ; $\psi^{-1}(y_1, ..., y_n)= (1-\sum_{i=1}^ny_i,y_1, ..., y_n)$ . So now   we can work on local (in fact global) coordinates on $U$ . The computation of the Fisher information metric is fairly   straightforward   (see https://www.ii.pwr.edu.pl/~tomczak/PDF/%5BJMT%5DFisher_inf.pdf for details). It   is given by: $$g(y)=\sum_{\substack{i=1}}^n \frac 1{y_i} dy_i \otimes dy_i$$ Let $y^0, y^1 \in U$ be two points, we would like to find the distance $d(y^0, y^1)$ induced by the Fisher information metric. This is the   length of the geodesic $\gamma :[0,1]\to \mathring \Delta^n$ between   the two. The length of a curve is given by: $$L(\gamma)=\int_0^1 \sqrt{\dot \gamma(t)^Tg(\gamma(t)) \dot \gamma(t) }\:  dt = \int_0^1 \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n \frac {\dot  \gamma_i(t)^2}{\gamma_i(t)}} \: dt$$ We can obtain the geodesic via the geodesic equation $\ddot \gamma_k +  \sum_{ij}\Gamma^k_{ij} \dot \gamma_i \dot \gamma_j =0$ , where $\Gamma^k_{ij}$ are the Christoffel symbols of the Levi-Civita   connection. In our case the only non-zero Christoffel symbols are: $$\Gamma^i_{ii}(y)=-\frac 1{2y_i}$$ The geodesic equation then becomes: $$2\gamma_i\ddot \gamma_i - ( \dot \gamma_i)^2  =0, \forall i  =1,...,n$$ where $\gamma_i$ is the $i$ -th component of the geodesic. It is clear from this equation that it admits a polynomial solution of   degree two. Solving with the boundary conditions $\gamma_i(0)=y^0_i,  \gamma_i(1)=y^1_i$ and constraint $0<\gamma_i(t)<1, \forall t$ , we obtain the geodesic: $$\gamma_i(t)=(\sqrt{y_i^0}-\sqrt  {y_i^1})^2t^2+2(\sqrt{y_i^0y_i^1}-y^0_i)t+y^0_i, t \in [0,1]$$ Recalling the definition of length, it is possible to show that $\frac {\dot  \gamma_i(t)^2}{\gamma_i(t)}\equiv constant, \forall i$ . One way to do this is   to take the derivative of this expression of notice that it is zero.   With some rearrangement this implies $$L(\gamma)= \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n \frac {\dot  \gamma_i(0)^2}{\gamma_i(0)}}= 2 ||\sqrt {y^1}- \sqrt {y^0}||=d(y^0,  y^1)$$ where $||\cdot||$ denotes the Euclidean metric and $\sqrt{\cdot}$ is   performed componentwise. Summarising, for points $x^0, x^1 \in \mathring \Delta^n$ , $$d(x^0, x^1) = 2|| \sqrt{\psi(x^0)}-\sqrt{ \psi(x^1) }||$$ where $||\cdot||$ denotes the Euclidean metric and $\sqrt{\cdot}$ is   performed componentwise. The resulting formula is nice because it relates the information distance to the Euclidean distance. The problem is: it depends on the choice of chart. If one chooses a different chart, e.g. $ \psi': \mathring \Delta^n \to Im(\psi') =:U' \subset \mathbb R^n : (x_0, ..., x_n) \mapsto (x_0, ..., x_{n-1})$ , one obtains different values for the distance. Seeing this problem, I was tempted not to work in a chart at all since the statistical manifold is a subset of $\mathbb R^{n+1}$ . That is to say, doing the exact same calculations using $x$ instead of $y$ and forgetting about charts. This gives the expression: $d(x^0, x^1) = 2|| \sqrt{x^0}-\sqrt{x^1 }||$ . This formula is much nicer than the first. It coincides (although rearranged) with the result obtained in p4 of http://www.pieter-kok.staff.shef.ac.uk/docs/geometrical_Cramer-Rao.pdf , using the Euclidean distance on the n-sphere. However, inspection shows that there are a number of problems with this. To obtain it I used an n+1 dimensional Fisher information matrix, while the statistical manifold is n-dimensional. The ensuing geodesic does not lie on the simplex, i.e. the sum of its n+1 components is mostly $\neq 1$ . This second approach corresponds to extending the statistical manifold of interest to an open neighbourhood of $\mathring \Delta^n$ , and indeed, the geodesics are geodesics in this space, as I could verify numerically that they were extrema of the energy functional of paths ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic#Riemannian_geometry ). Lastly, the case $n=1$ is sketched in http://www.boris-belousov.net/2017/07/11/distance-between-probabilities/#geodesic-distance-between-distributions but doesn't coincide with any of these approaches.

42,Two definitions of spin structure,Two definitions of spin structure,,"There is a say standard definition of spin structure for an oriented manifold $M$: it is a principial $spin(n)$ bundle $Spin(M)$ together with the equivariant map $\eta:Spin(M) \to SO(M)$ where $SO(M)$ is orthonormal frame bundle (of oriented frames) and equivariance is understood via the concrete map $\rho: spin(n) \to SO(n)$ being $2:1$ covering map.

There is always the isomorphism $O(M) \times_{id} \mathbb{R}^n \cong TM$ where $O(M)$ is orthonormal frame bundle. Once $M$ is oriented we can replace $O(M)$ by $SO(M)$. 2.

Then the derivative of $X$ in the direction of a vector $v$ is given by $D_v X=\sum_{i=1}^n v(X^i)e_i$. Essentially, we just  differentiate the coeffient functions. The key is to think of vectors $\{e_1,\cdots,e_n\}$ as being constant. However, on a manifold, this no longer holds: There are no natural vector field which we can take to be `constant'. Could anyone find a simple explanation of the above sentence? And a counter example?","I am looking for a counter example that why the $\mathbb{R}^n$ definition of vector field fail on a manifold.

Wald instead says that a covariant derivative is a way to associate to a tensor field $T\in\mathcal T^{(k,\ell)}(M)$ another tensor field $\nabla T\in T^{(k,\ell+1)}(M)$ written in the index notation as $$\nabla_c{T^{a_1,\ldots,a_k}}_{b_1,\ldots,b_\ell}$$ such that it satisfies certain conditions. Now even if I understand the abstract index notation (infact I recognize that $\nabla_c{T^{a_1,\ldots,a_k}}_{b_1,\ldots,b_\ell}$ is a $(k,\ell+1)$-tensor) I don't understand how this approach coincides with the above one.

The bi-invariant metric is unique up to scaling if the Lie group is compact and Lie algebra is simple. We can conclude that both these two bi-invariant metrics are unique up to scaling.

If this holds, then maybe I can just study about the problem in $S^3$ ? But I'm still not sure if I'm right and how to interprete these in a precise way.

Edit 2023/6/3: After some searchings, I find that the geodesic distance above is the bi-invariant metric defined on and the angular distance in is also bi-invariant. The bi-invariant metric is unique up to scaling if the Lie group is compact and Lie algebra is simple. We can conclude that both these two bi-invariant metrics are unique up to scaling. Now if I consider a diffeomorphism and locally the looks the same as , maybe we can consider the homomorphism: and somehow prove that after the homomorphism, the new metric is still bi-invariant (I'm not sure if I'm right). If this holds, then maybe I can just study about the problem in ? But I'm still not sure if I'm right and how to interprete these in a precise way. Also I think my previous thought of using the stereographic projection to simply the problem is not valid, for the smallest ball in after stereographic projection isn't the smallest on the . So I'm still wondering how to tackle this.","SO_3

89,More details in the proof of the equivalence of categories between vector bundles over a smooth manifold and locally free sheaves,More details in the proof of the equivalence of categories between vector bundles over a smooth manifold and locally free sheaves,,"$\def\VB{\mathsf{VB}} \def\sO{\mathcal{O}} \def\Mod{\mathsf{Mod}} \def\LFMod{\mathsf{LFMod}}$ For a ringed space $(X,\sO_X)$ and a ring $R$ , denote $\Mod(\sO_X)$ and $\Mod(R)$ to the categories of $\sO_X$ -modules and of $R$ -modules. Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and denote $\sO_M$ to the sheaf of smooth functions on $M$ . Denote $\VB(M)$ to the category of smooth vector bundles over $M$ with vector bundle homomorphisms. For a vector bundle $\pi:E\to M$ over $M$ , denote $\Sigma_E$ to the sheaf of sections of $\pi$ . There is a functor \begin{align*} \Sigma:\VB(M)&\to\Mod(\sO_M)\\ E&\mapsto\Sigma_E\\ F:E\to E'&\mapsto F_*:\Sigma_E\to\Sigma_{E'}, \end{align*} where $F_*$ is induced by postcomposition by $F$ . (Actually, postcomposition induces a morphism of hom-sheaves $\mathcal{H}om_{\VB(M)}(E,E')\to\mathcal{H}om_{\sO_M}(\Sigma_E,\Sigma_{E'})$ ). Working in a local frame, one can see that $\Sigma$ is faithful by seeing that $\Gamma\circ\Sigma$ is faithful, where $\Gamma:\Mod(\sO_M)\to\Mod(\underbrace{\Gamma(M,\sO_M)}_{C^\infty(M)})$ denotes the global sections functor. Less trivial is that the functor $\Sigma$ is also full. For this, one first checks that the functor $\Gamma\circ \Sigma$ is full: this is Lemma 10.29 of Lee's Introduction to Smooth Manifolds . Leveraging Lee's proof, one can show after fullness of $\Sigma$ : Given vector bundles $E$ and $E'$ over $M$ and an $\sO_M$ -linear map $\varphi:\Sigma_E\to\Sigma_{E'}$ , denote $F^U:E|_U\to E'|_U$ to the unique vector bundle homomorphism such that $\Gamma\circ\Sigma(F^U)=\Gamma(F^U_*)=\varphi_U$ . Using the explicit definition of $F^U$ given in Lee's proof of Lemma 10.29, one can check that $F^U|_{U\cap V}=F^V|_{U\cap V}:E|_{U\cap V}\to E'|_{U\cap V}$ . Therefore, the $F^U$ 's glue to a vector bundle homomorphism $F:E\to E'$ such that $F|_U=F^U$ . Thus, since $F_*|_U=(F|_U)_*=F_*^U$ , one has $F_{*,U}=\Gamma(F^U_*)=\varphi_U$ , i.e., $F_*=\varphi$ . This shows that $\Sigma$ is a fully faithful functor and hence an equivalence of categories into its essential image. It is clear that the image of $\Sigma$ is contained in the full subcategory of locally free $\sO_M$ -modules. What I am interested is on finding a detailed proof that locally free $\sO_M$ -modules are in fact the essential image of $\Sigma$ . The only reference I am aware of is Ramanan's Global Calculus . He discusses this essential surjectivity in Chapter 2, between definitions 2.8 and 2.9. However, I find the argument sketched on his discussion a little bit unsatisfactory. So my questions are: Do you know any reference which proves the essential surjectivity of $\Sigma:\VB(M)\to\LFMod(\sO_M)$ with more detail than Ramanan does? Do you know yourself a more detailed proof of this fact than Ramanan's one?

97,Why is the rank of the determinant map constant?,Why is the rank of the determinant map constant?,,"Consider the group $GL(n,\mathbb{R})$ . I am interested in showing that the determinant map on this group has a constant rank. Our professor justified this fact in the following way, let $A\in GL(n,\mathbb{R})$ and $a=det(A).$ Then, $$\operatorname{det} = l_a\circ \operatorname{det}\circ L_{A^{-1}}$$ where $l_a(x)=ax$ for $x\neq 0$ and $L_{A^{-1}}(X)=A^{-1}X$ are left translation on $\mathbb{R}^*$ and $GL(n,\mathbb{R})$ respectively. Then using the chain rule one gets that $$\operatorname{rank} d_{X}\operatorname{det} = \operatorname{rank} d_{A^{-1}X}\operatorname{det}$$ and then choosing $A=X$ we can see that the rank is constant.

98,Norm of the Riemannian curvature tensor,Norm of the Riemannian curvature tensor,,"Let $c: [a, b] \to M$ be a geodesic on a Riemannian manifold $(M, \left< \cdot, \cdot \right>)$ . Define $\mathcal{V}_c := \Gamma(c^* TM)$ , the space of vector fields along $c$ , and $\hat{\mathcal{V}}_c$ the vector fields $V \in \hat{\mathcal{V}}_c$ satisfying $V(a) = V(b) = 0$ . Consider the norm on $\hat{\mathcal{V}}_c$ given by $||X||^2 = \int_a^b \left[\left<D_t X, D_t X\right> + \left<X, X\right> \right]dt$ , and let $\hat{H}_c^1$ be the completion of $\hat{\mathcal{V}}_c$ w.r.t. $||\cdot||$ . This space is easily identified with the Sobolev space $H^1_0(I, \mathbb{R}^n)$ . We define the index form $I$ as a symmetric bilinear form on $\hat{H}_c^1$ given by $I(X, Y) = \int_a^b \left[\left<D_t X, D_t Y\right> - \left<R(\dot{c}, X)Y, \dot{c}\right>\right]dt$ . Define the index of $c$ , Ind $(c)$ , as the dimension of the largest subspace of $\hat{H}_c^1$ on which $I$ is negative definite. Lemma 4.3.2 of Riemannian Geometry and Global Analysis by Jost states that Ind $(c)$ is finite. To prove this statement, Jost supposes that it does not hold, so that we may assume the existence of a sequence $(X_n)\subset \hat{H}_c^1$ such that $I(X_n, X_n) \le 0$ and such that $(X_n)$ is orthonormal w.r.t. the $L^2_c$ product. From $I(X_n, X_n) \le 0$ , we immediately obtain $\int_a^b \left< D_t X_n, D_t X_n \right>dt \le \int_a^b \left<R(\dot{c}, X_n)X_n, \dot{c}\right>dt$ . Jost then concludes that $\int_a^b \left<R(\dot{c}, X_n)X_n, \dot{c}\right>dt \le E(c)\sup|R|$ , where $E$ is the energy of $c$ and $R$ is the curvature tensor on $M$ . Why does this hold? What does $\sup |R|$ actually mean here? Is it related to the extension of the Frobenius norm discussed here ? My first thought was to consider the vector field $Z(t) = \frac{\dot{c}(t)}{\sqrt{E(c)}}$ , so that $Z$ is smooth and $||Z||_{L_c^2} = 1$ .
