The symmetric-decreasing rearrangement of a measurable function $f:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ is then defined by $$f^*(x):=\int_0^{\infty} \chi_{\{|f|>t\}^*}(x)dt,$$ by comparison to the ""layercake"" representation of $f$, namely   $$f(x)=\int_0^{\infty} \chi_{\{f>t\}}(x)dt.$$ Note that one can equally define $f^*$ to be the radial symmetric, decreasing function such that the level sets of $f^*$ and $f$ have the same measure (or volume). I don't know why, but it always occurs to me that the rearrangement process is a regularizing process. Here's my question: If $f$ is $k$ times continuously differentiable, does it follow that $f^*$ possesses the same regularity?",,"['real-analysis', 'measure-theory', 'derivatives', 'decreasing-rearrangements']"
24,$n$th derivative of $f(x)$ using limit definition,th derivative of  using limit definition,n f(x),"After playing around with the limit definition of the derivative for higher order derivatives, I noticed the following odd relationship to determine it for an nth order derivative: Let $F^n=f(x+nh)$ (is there a way to write this properly as an operator on $f(x)$?), then $$f^{(n)}(x)=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{(F-1)^n}{h^n}=\left(\lim_{h\to0} \frac{F-1}{h}\right)^n$$ Expanding the middle equality gives it in terms of $f(x+nh)$s. Notice that the inside of the bracket on the RHS is equal to $f'(x)$ (sort of). I have actually proven that this is indeed true using repeated use of L'Hopital's law and proof by induction, but I am unsatisfied. The result in the form above seems almost magical, and makes me think there is a very elegant reason why. Can someone explain why? Based on the result, I suspect umbral calculus gives a nice explanation, but I do not know a lot about it.  So can someone explain why the above has such an elegant form?

37,Question about Differentials,Question about Differentials,,"I am reading the book ""Advanced Calculus"" written by Kaplan, and here is what I have: Suppose that $y(x)$ is a differentiable function at $x = x_0$ . Then, we can write $y(x_0+\Delta x) = y(x_0) + y'(x_0)\cdot \Delta x + \epsilon\cdot \Delta x, \, where \, \epsilon \rightarrow 0  \:  as \, \Delta x \rightarrow 0$ . We denote the differential of $y$ by $dy = y'(x_0)\cdot\Delta x$ . Now note that if $g(x) = x$ , then $g$ is clearly differentiable at $x = x_0$ , so we have $dg = dx = 1\cdot\Delta x$ , from which it follows that $dy =   y'(x_0)\cdot\Delta x=  y'(x_0)\cdot dx$ Also, if $y'(x_0) \neq 0 $ , we can write $dx = \dfrac{1}{y'(x_0)}dy$ I am uncomfortable with the last line $dx = \dfrac{1}{y'(x_0)}dy$ because I think that in order for this expression to be ""meaningful"", it must be true that x can be written as a function of y, and this function must be differentiable at $y = f(x_0)$ . But, as far as I know, mere existence of nonzero derivative of $f(x)$ at $x=x_0$ does not imply the invertibility of y(x), let alone its differentiability. To illustrate my point, say, for instance, that we have $y(2) = 1$ and $y'(2)= 3$ so that $dy = 3dx$ Then, according to Kaplan, we can write $dx = \dfrac{1}{3}dy$ . But then, if somone else sees only $dx = \dfrac{1}{3}dy$ at $(x,y) = (1,2)$ , then he/she would think that x is a function of y with $x(1) = 2$ and $x'(1) = \dfrac{1}{3}$ . But, the fact that $y(2) = 1$ and $y'(2) = 3$ does not imply $x(1) = 2$ and $x'(1) = \dfrac{1}{3}$ . Right?
