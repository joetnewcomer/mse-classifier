The symmetries acting upon an object usually, if not always, form a group to my knowledge, but I was wondering whether the same could be said in the case of fractal objects, which often have non-integer dimensions. I'll try and describe a couple of possible fractal objects that might have some interesting properties. For example, let me make a construction using the sierpinski gasket . Label the corners $0$ (at the origin), $A$ (the point with the highest $y$ value), and $B$ (the point with the highest $x$ value). Say that $A$ has co-ordinates $(\frac{X}{2},Y)$, and hence $B$ has co-ordinates $(X,0)$. Then make a copy of the gasket and translate it by $(X,0)$, and then make another copy of the original gasket and translate it $(\frac{X}{2},Y)$. Then you have made a dilated copy of the gasket. Iterate this process ad infinitum. Then you have the first object I would like to look at.

Furthermore, the reflection which maps $0$ to $0$ and $A$ to $B$ is fixes this new object too.

So for an initial problem, could anyone tell me what the symmetry group of this object is isomorphic to, and does anyone else have any experience with this area?

18,Group Presentations and Cayley graphs,Group Presentations and Cayley graphs,,"I am trying to understand group presentations and Cayley graphs, and have a few questions I am confused about. Let $G=(V,E)$ be a finite $d$ -regular graph that is known to be a Cayley graph for the group $\Gamma$ and a symmetric generating set $S=\{s_1,s_2,\dots,s_d\} \subset \Gamma$ . Now it is clear that any cycle (or a closed walk) in the graph can be expressed as a word over $S$ that evaluates to the identity in the group $\Gamma$ . The converse is also true: any word over $S$ that evaluates to the identity element in $\Gamma$ can be used to construct a cycle in the graph $G$ . Let $R$ be the set of all words over $S$ that evaluate to the identity (in other words, $R$ is the set of all cycles in $G$ ). The set $R$ is closed under concatenation of words, and is a subgroup of the free group $Free(S)$ . Is it necessarily true that $$\Gamma \cong Free(S)/R$$ that is, is the quotient of the free group by the subgroup of relations formed using cycles in the Cayley graph isomorphic to the group $\Gamma$ ? Intuitively, it seems reasonable to think so. Almost obvious, (UPDATE: it is obvious!) which brings me to the main question. Suppose $G=(V,E)$ is again an $n$ -vertex $d$ -regular graph. But now we do not know if it is a Cayley graph. Choose an arbitrary orientation of each edge and  trivially use a larger label set $S=\{s_1,s_2,\dots,s_{|E|}\}$ to associate each oriented edge with a corresponding symbol, and its reverse orientation with an inverse of that symbol. That is, we associate each edge with two (oppositely) oriented (or directed) edges and associate them with a symbol $s$ and $s^{-1}$ . Now again we can consider the free group $Free(S)$ and a subgroup $R$ generated by words over $S$ that correspond to cycles in the graph. Is $R$ normal? Are there combinatorial conditions on the graph that make $R$ normal? Suppose $R$ is normal. What can we say about the group $Free(S)/R$ ?

Let be a finite -regular graph that is known to be a Cayley graph for the group and a symmetric generating set . Now it is clear that any cycle (or a closed walk) in the graph can be expressed as a word over that evaluates to the identity in the group . The converse is also true: any word over that evaluates to the identity element in can be used to construct a cycle in the graph . Let be the set of all words over that evaluate to the identity (in other words, is the set of all cycles in ). The set is closed under concatenation of words, and is a subgroup of the free group . Is it necessarily true that that is, is the quotient of the free group by the subgroup of relations formed using cycles in the Cayley graph isomorphic to the group ? Intuitively, it seems reasonable to think so. Almost obvious, (UPDATE: it is obvious!) which brings me to the main question. Suppose is again an -vertex -regular graph. But now we do not know if it is a Cayley graph. Choose an arbitrary orientation of each edge and  trivially use a larger label set to associate each oriented edge with a corresponding symbol, and its reverse orientation with an inverse of that symbol. That is, we associate each edge with two (oppositely) oriented (or directed) edges and associate them with a symbol and . Now again we can consider the free group and a subgroup generated by words over that correspond to cycles in the graph. Is normal? Are there combinatorial conditions on the graph that make normal?

Suppose that $A$ contains no infinitely $p$-divisible elements, then does the same hold for $A\otimes \mathbb Z_p$, where $\mathbb Z_p$ denotes the $p$-adic integers? Edit: This question has been put on hold for not providing enough context, so let me give some. I encountered the problem in algebraic geometry, namely: If $A,B$ be abelian varieties, then it is well-known that the map $\mathrm{Hom} (A,B)\otimes \mathbb Z_p\rightarrow\mathrm{Hom}(T_pA,T_pB)$ is injective for all $p\neq \mathrm{char}k$, where $k$  is the ground field. I noticed that the proof of this fact would be much easier if the answer to the question were positive, which intuitively seemed plausible to me. (Of course $\mathrm{Hom} (A,B)$ is in fact finitely generated, but this is a corollary and can't be assumed in the proof). I will admit though that I don't have much confidence in my intuition in infinitely-generated situations. Here are a few thoughts I had about some intrinsic (commutative-algebra) motivation to the question: For any abelian group, we can consider the $p$-adic topology on it, just as for any $R$-module $M$ we can consider the $I$-adic topology, where $R$ is a commutative ring, and $I$ an ideal. For finitely generated modules over noetherian rings, there is a nice theory of completions. The completion $\hat M$ is itself complete and coincides with the base change to the completed ring: $\hat M\cong \hat R\otimes M$. For non-finitely-generated modules, we can still consider the $I$-adic topology, but it doesn't seem to be very well-behaved: the $p$-adic topology  in this sense on $\mathbb Q$ as a $\mathbb Z$-module is trivial. But there is another way of putting a topology on these modules: consider them as a direct limit over their finitely generated submodules, endow these with the $I$-adic topology, and look at the limit topology on $M$. In this way, $\mathbb Q$ attains the ""right"" $p$-adic topology. Since the completion of a noetherian ring is flat over the ring itself, we can also make $M\otimes \hat R$ into a topological $\hat R$-module in the same way, by writing it as the direct limit of finitely generated submodules of $M$, each tensored with $\hat R$. In the example of before we get, unsurprisingly, $\mathbb Q_p$. So now a natural question is how these objects all fit together: We have $M$ with the naive $I$-adic topology, $M$ with the limit topology, and $M\otimes \hat R$. Is $M\otimes \hat R$ the completion of $M$ with the limit topology, and is said completion itself complete? Here the completion may be defined as a projective limit over $M/U$, where $U$ ranges through open subgroups containing 0. In the question, $R=\mathbb{Z}$, $I=(p)$ and $M$ contains no infinitely $p$-divisible elements, which I think should make the naive and the limit topology on $M$ coincide and the whole situation can probably be regarded as the easiest case. If the completion is to be equal to $M\otimes \mathbb Z_p$, then there had better not be any infinitely $p$-divisible elements in there. I think this would be equivalent to the statement that $M\otimes \mathbb Z_p$ with the naive $p$-adic topology is Hausdorff. So this is more than I thought I'd write and given the speculative nature of the thing, I'm bound to have made some embarassing mistake along the way.. In any case, I'd also appreciate references about completions and the like for infinitely-generated modules. And given the above discussion, I'm also putting the commutative-algebra tag back in.","Let $A$ be a (possibly non-finitely generated) torsion-free abelian group. Suppose that $A$ contains no infinitely $p$-divisible elements, then does the same hold for $A\otimes \mathbb Z_p$, where $\mathbb Z_p$ denotes the $p$-adic integers? Edit: This question has been put on hold for not providing enough context, so let me give some. I encountered the problem in algebraic geometry, namely: If $A,B$ be abelian varieties, then it is well-known that the map $\mathrm{Hom} (A,B)\otimes \mathbb Z_p\rightarrow\mathrm{Hom}(T_pA,T_pB)$ is injective for all $p\neq \mathrm{char}k$, where $k$  is the ground field. I noticed that the proof of this fact would be much easier if the answer to the question were positive, which intuitively seemed plausible to me. (Of course $\mathrm{Hom} (A,B)$ is in fact finitely generated, but this is a corollary and can't be assumed in the proof). I will admit though that I don't have much confidence in my intuition in infinitely-generated situations. Here are a few thoughts I had about some intrinsic (commutative-algebra) motivation to the question: For any abelian group, we can consider the $p$-adic topology on it, just as for any $R$-module $M$ we can consider the $I$-adic topology, where $R$ is a commutative ring, and $I$ an ideal. For finitely generated modules over noetherian rings, there is a nice theory of completions. The completion $\hat M$ is itself complete and coincides with the base change to the completed ring: $\hat M\cong \hat R\otimes M$. For non-finitely-generated modules, we can still consider the $I$-adic topology, but it doesn't seem to be very well-behaved: the $p$-adic topology  in this sense on $\mathbb Q$ as a $\mathbb Z$-module is trivial. But there is another way of putting a topology on these modules: consider them as a direct limit over their finitely generated submodules, endow these with the $I$-adic topology, and look at the limit topology on $M$. In this way, $\mathbb Q$ attains the ""right"" $p$-adic topology. Since the completion of a noetherian ring is flat over the ring itself, we can also make $M\otimes \hat R$ into a topological $\hat R$-module in the same way, by writing it as the direct limit of finitely generated submodules of $M$, each tensored with $\hat R$.

Hence the two products are equal iff $b=c=0$ that is $Q$ is of the form $\begin{pmatrix} a & 0 \\\ 0 & d \end{pmatrix}$.

The specific klein-4 group I am working with is that generated by $\bigl(\begin{smallmatrix} 1&0&1 \\ 0&1&0 \\ 0&0&1 \end{smallmatrix} \bigr)$  and  $\bigl(\begin{smallmatrix} 1&0&0 \\ 0&1&1 \\ 0&0&1 \end{smallmatrix} \bigr)$,How do I go about finding elements of order 3 in $GL_3(2)$?

97,Is the number of elements$g$ in a finite Abelian group $G$ such that the $| g|= k$ always equal to a multiple of $\varphi(k)$?,Is the number of elements in a finite Abelian group  such that the  always equal to a multiple of ?,g G | g|= k \varphi(k),"Let $G $ be a finite Abelian group.  I know that if $G$ is cyclic then there are exactly $\varphi(k)$ elements in $G$ that have order $k$ for each $k$ that divides $|G|$. I also know that $G$ can be written as a group direct product of cyclic groups.  This gives me a hazy notion that the number of elements $g$ in $G$ that have order $k$ is a multiple of $\varphi(k)$.  In other words, it seems like if I construct a cycle graph of $G$ then every element must be on some cycle C and that on this cycle there would be exactly $\varphi(k)$ elements of order $k$ for each $k$ that divides the length of the cycle $C$.

98,Existence of non-abelian group of order n,Existence of non-abelian group of order n,,"I know this is an old quetion, but I've certainly been disappointed with the given answers. The question is: There exists a characterization of the natural numbers $n$ such that there exist at least one non-abelian group of order $n$?  In this web http://oeis.org/A060652 , those numbers are called ""non-abelian orders"" and they state this: Let the prime factorization of $n$ be $p_1^{e_1}\cdots p_r^{e_r}$. Then $n$ is in this sequence (of non-abelian orders) if $e_i>2$ for some $i$ or $p_i^k\equiv1$(mod $p_j$) for some $i$ and $j$ and $1\leq k\leq e_i$.

It is clear that if both of these conditions fail to hold, then the only remainig option is $p_i^2\equiv 1$(mod $p_j$) for some $i\neq j$.
