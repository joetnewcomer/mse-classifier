It appears that the sequence is growing slightly sublinearly. After $10^6$, the largest ratio $F(n)/n$ I can find is $0.713924$ for $1110609$. After $2\cdot10^6$, it's $0.712693$ for $2097749$.

Or can it be proved in a ""hard"" way?","3\cdot 2^n + 1 2^{2^m}+1 2^\kappa \cdot 3 + 1,\  2^\kappa \cdot 5 + 1","['sequences-and-series', 'elementary-number-theory', 'divisibility', 'fermat-numbers']"
20,Which positive continuous functions satisfy $F(x) = F(e^x)-F(e^{-x})$ for $x\geq 0$?,Which positive continuous functions satisfy  for ?,F(x) = F(e^x)-F(e^{-x}) x\geq 0,"There is at least one such function. It is the cdf of the equilibrium probability distribution for the chaotic sequence $x(n+1) = |\log x(n)|$ with $x(1) = 2$ . Its graph (approximation) is pictured below. I am interested in a series expansion for the density $f(x)$ , which is the derivative of $F(x)$ . Note I expect that if you start with a different seed, say $x(1) =3$ , you end up with the same distribution, unless you pick up one of the very rare seeds (called bad seed) that results in a different $F$ . The set of bad seeds has Lebesgue measure zero, but it is infinite and even dense. My intuition is based on the following: consider instead $x(n+1) = bx(n) - \lfloor bx(n) \rfloor$ . The equilibrium distribution is uniform on $[0, 1]$ this time (if $b$ is an integer larger than 1) unless you pick up a bad seed. All rational numbers are bad seeds. Tons of other numbers are bad seeds. But the vast majority are good seeds. A good seed is equivalent to a normal number: its digits in base $b$ are evenly distributed.

Similarly, in our context here, proving that $x(1) = 2$ is a good seed is a very hard problem, and possibly un-provable. Yet plenty of evidence makes you believe that it is a good seed. Some sequences such as $x(n+1) = b+x(n) - \lfloor b + x(n)\rfloor$ do not have bad seeds if $b$ is irrational. The logistic map $x(n+1) = 4x(n)\cdot (1-x(n))$ has plenty of bad seeds.

The whole class has had problems with proving that the sequence diverges (because according to Wolfram the sequence is divergent).

EDIT (Progress according to a user's proposal, I think you have good ideas)--------------- The idea is to first assume that $x_n=0$ for some $n\in\mathbb{N}$ , and let $N=\min\{ n\in\mathbb{N}\;:\; x_n=0\}$ , then $\displaystyle x_{N+1}=\frac{x_N+x_{N-1}}{x_N-x_{N-1}}=\frac{x_{N-1}}{-x_{N-1}}=-1$ and $\displaystyle  x_{N+2}=\frac{x_{N+1}+x_N}{x_{N+1}-x_N}=\frac{-1}{-1}=1 $ in this way we have the sequence behaves $0, -1, 1, 0, -1, 1,...$ and diverges. Now assuming that $x_n\neq 0$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and suppose that $(x_n)$ converges to $L$ , then $\displaystyle x_{n+2}(x_{n+1}-x_n)=x_{n+1}+x_n \Rightarrow $ $L(L-L)=L+L$ and $L=0$ .

32,Generalized limits,Generalized limits,,"Cross-posted to Mathoverflow . $\DeclareMathOperator{\Lim}{Lim}$ $\DeclareMathOperator{\dom}{dom}$ $\DeclareMathOperator{\shift}{\sigma}$ $\DeclareMathOperator{\cesaro}{C}$ After reading Terry Tao's post on generalizations of the limit functional , I'm interested in the concept of a ""generalized limit"", which agrees with the ordinary limit when the latter exists, but also extends it to new sequences. Let $X$ be a metrized module. A generalized limit is a partial function from sequences of elements of $X$ to $X$ : $$\Lim : \bigcup_{S \subseteq X^\mathbb{N}} X^S$$ Let $\lim$ be the Cauchy limit. That is, $\lim x = a$ iff $$\forall \varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}^+ : \exists N \in \mathbb{N} : \forall n \in \mathbb{N} : n > N \rightarrow d(x(n),a) < \varepsilon$$ $\Lim_1$ is weaker than $\Lim_2$ iff $$\Lim_1 \subseteq \Lim_2$$ $\Lim$ is regular iff it is stronger than $\lim$ . $\Lim_1$ is consistent with $\Lim_2$ iff $$\forall x \in (\dom \Lim_1 \cap \dom \Lim_2) : \Lim_1(x) = \Lim_2(x)$$ $\Lim$ is homogeneous iff $$\forall a \in X : \forall x \in \dom \Lim: \Lim(a x) = a \Lim(x)$$ $\Lim$ is additive iff $$\forall x, y \in \dom \Lim : \Lim(x + y) = \Lim(x) + \Lim(y)$$ $\Lim$ is linear iff it is homogeneous and additive. $\Lim$ is stable iff $$\Lim = \Lim \circ \shift$$ where $\shift : X^\mathbb{N} \rightarrow X^\mathbb{N}$ is the shift transform defined by $$\shift(a)(n) = a(n+1)$$ If $a \neq 1$ and $\Lim$ is stable and homogeneous, then $\Lim (n \mapsto a^n) = 0$ . Proof: \begin{align}     \Lim (n \mapsto a^n)     &= (\Lim \circ \shift) (n \mapsto a^n) & \text{(stability)} \\     &= \Lim(\shift(n \mapsto a^n)) \\     &= \Lim(n \mapsto a^{n+1}) \\     &= \Lim(a (n \mapsto a^n)) \\     &= a \Lim(n \mapsto a^n) & \text{(homogeneity)} \\     (1 - a) \Lim(n \mapsto a^n) &= 0 \\     \Lim(n \mapsto a^n) &= 0 \end{align} Note that if $a$ is prime then this yields the correct $a$ -adic limit . This also yields the expected generalized sum of a geometric series: \begin{align}     \sum_{n=0}^\infty a^n     &= \Lim\left(m \mapsto \sum_{n=0}^m a^n\right) \\     &= \Lim\left(m \mapsto \frac{1-a^{m+1}}{1-a}\right) \\     &= \frac{1 - \Lim(m \mapsto a^{m+1})}{1-a} \\     &= \frac{1}{1-a} \\ \end{align} Consequently, if $\Lim$ is stable and linear then \begin{align}   \Lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \cos n   &= \Lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\mathrm{e}^{in} + \mathrm{e}^{-in}}{2} \\   &= \frac{\Lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} (\mathrm{e}^{i})^n + \Lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} (\mathrm{e}^{-i})^n}{2} \\   &= 0 \end{align} and the same is true of $\sin$ , we also have \begin{align}   \Lim_{m \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{n=0}^m \cos n   &= \Lim_{m \rightarrow \infty} \left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\cos(m)}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \cot \frac{1}{2} \sin m\right) \\   &= \frac{1}{2} \\   \Lim_{m \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{n=0}^m \sin n   &= \Lim_{m \rightarrow \infty} \left(\frac{1}{2} \cot \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sin m}{2} - \frac{1}{2} \cos m \cot \frac{1}{2}\right) \\   &= \frac{1}{2} \cot \frac{1}{2} \end{align} More generally, if $a \neq 1$ and $\Lim$ is stable and linear then \begin{align}   \Lim_{m \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{n=0}^m a^n n^b   &= \Lim_{m \rightarrow \infty} (\mathrm{Li}_{-b}(a) - a^{m+1} \Phi(a,-b,m+1)) \\   &= \mathrm{Li}_{-b}(a) + \Lim_{m \rightarrow \infty} a^{m+1} \Phi(a,-b,m+1) \\   &= \mathrm{Li}_{-b}(a) \end{align} \begin{align}   \Lim_{m \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{n=0}^m a^n n!   &= \Lim_{m \rightarrow \infty} \left( -\frac{\mathrm{e}^{-1/a} \Gamma(0,-1/a)}{a} + (-1)^{m+1} \frac{\mathrm{e}^{-1/a} \Gamma(-m-1,-1/a) (m+1)!}{a} \right) \\   &= -\frac{\mathrm{e}^{-1/a} \Gamma(0,-1/a)}{a} + \Lim_{m \rightarrow \infty} (-1)^{m+1} \frac{\mathrm{e}^{-1/a} \Gamma(-m-1,-1/a) (m+1)!}{a} \\   &= -\frac{\mathrm{e}^{-1/a} \Gamma(0,-1/a)}{a} \end{align} where $\mathrm{Li}$ is the polylogarithm and $\Phi$ is the Lerch transcendent. Thus the properties of stability and linearity alone make the generalized limit quite powerful. Question: Is there a $\Lim$ such that $\Lim$ can be explicitly defined in terms of the Cauchy limit, e.g. $\Lim = \lim \circ f$ where $f$ is some sequence transform. $\Lim$ is stronger than (i.e. contains) the stable and linear closure of the Cauchy limit. The Cesàro transform $\cesaro : X^\mathbb{N} \rightarrow X^\mathbb{N}$ yields the sequence of partial averages: $$\cesaro(a)(n) = \frac{1}{n+1}\sum_{k=0}^n a(k)$$ For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ , let the $n$ -Cesàro limit be the Cauchy limit of the Cesàro transform iterated $n$ times: $$\lim \circ \cesaro^n$$ The $n$ -Cesàro limit is regular, linear, and stable. Moreover, $$\lim \circ \cesaro^n \subsetneq \lim \circ \cesaro^{n+1}$$ The inclusion is proper as can be seen by taking the sequence $$k \mapsto (-1)^k k^n$$ which is in the domain of the latter but not the former. Let the $\omega$ -Cesàro limit be the union of all such limits: $$\bigcup_{n < \omega} \lim \circ \cesaro^n$$ That is, the $\omega$ -Cesàro limit is the closure of the Cauchy limit under Cesàro transforms. My question is this: Are there any interesting examples of linear limits that are (non-strictly) stronger than the $\omega$ -Cesàro limit? What about stronger than the closure of the $\omega$ -Cesàro limit under stability (shift transforms)? This last property would allow it to regularize geometric limits. Note: It would not have to be stable itself, just stronger than the stable closure of the $\omega$ -Cesàro limit. I suspect sequence transformations used to accelerate the rate of convergence of sequences, like the Shanks transformation and Aitken's delta-squared process , might be useful here.","Cross-posted to Mathoverflow .

I stumbled across this series while trying to evaluate $$\int_1^\infty\frac{1}{\lfloor x^2\rfloor}dx$$ The convergence of this integral can be seen by making use of the inequality $\lfloor x\rfloor > x-1$ and the fact that $\coth^{-1}(t)\to 0$ as $t\to\infty$ : \begin{align*} \int_1^t\frac{1}{\lfloor x^2\rfloor}dx &= \int_\sqrt{1}^\sqrt{2}\frac{1}{\lfloor x^2\rfloor}dx+\int_\sqrt{2}^t\frac{1}{\lfloor x^2\rfloor}dx\\ &< \int_\sqrt{1}^\sqrt{2}\frac{1}{\lfloor x^2\rfloor}dx+\int_\sqrt{2}^t\frac{1}{x^2-1}dx\\ &= \int_\sqrt{1}^\sqrt{2}\frac{1}{1}dx-\int_\sqrt{2}^t\frac{1}{1-x^2}dx\\ &= \sqrt{2}-1-\left[\coth^{-1}(t)-\coth^{-1}\left(\sqrt 2\right)\right]\\ &= \sqrt{2}-1-\coth^{-1}(t)+\coth^{-1}\left(\sqrt 2\right)\\ &\to \sqrt{2}-1+\coth^{-1}\left(\sqrt 2\right)\text{ as }t\to\infty\\ \end{align*} Since this implies that $\int_1^t 1/\lfloor x^2\rfloor dx$ is strictly increasing ( $1/\lfloor x^2\rfloor >0$ for every $x\geq 1$ ) and bounded above, the integral necessarily converges. By breaking up the integral $$\int_1^\sqrt{k+1}\frac{1}{\lfloor x^2\rfloor}dx$$ into integrals indexed by the intervals $\left[\sqrt{i},\sqrt{i+1}\right]$ for $i=1,2,3,...,k$ and simplifying the resulting sum, I was able to show that $$\int_1^{\sqrt{k+1}}\frac{1}{\lfloor x^2\rfloor}dx=\sum_{n=1}^{k} \frac{\sqrt{n+1}-\sqrt n}{n}$$ is true for every $k\geq 0$ , which yields $$\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{\lfloor x^2\rfloor}dx=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{\sqrt{n+1}-\sqrt n}{n}$$ after letting $k\to\infty$ . This equality is the main reason why I'm interested in the sum of the aforementioned series. After some (unsurprisingly) futile attempts to evaluate the integral, I expect there to be no closed-form expression for the sum, which is why I'm open to an analytic expression (gamma function, Bessel functions, Riemann zeta function, etc.). Any help is appreciated. Edit : after seeing the bounds provided by Markus Scheuer and Jorge, I thought I'd share some of my own. From the fact that $x-1<\lfloor x\rfloor<x$ is true for every non-integer $x\geq 1$ , we can infer that for every integer $k\geq 1$ , $$\int_\sqrt{k+1}^\infty \frac{1}{x^2}dx<\int_\sqrt{k+1}^\infty \frac{1}{\lfloor x^2\rfloor}dx<\int_\sqrt{k+1}^\infty \frac{1}{x^2-1}dx$$ Using $$\int_{x}^{\infty}\frac{1}{t^2-1}dt=\coth^{-1}(x)$$ and $$\int_\sqrt{k+1}^\infty\frac{1}{\lfloor x^2\rfloor}dx=\int_1^\infty\frac{1}{\lfloor x^2\rfloor}dx-\int_1^\sqrt{k+1}\frac{1}{\lfloor x^2\rfloor}dx=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\sqrt{n+1}-\sqrt n}{n}-\sum_{n=1}^{k}\frac{\sqrt{n+1}-\sqrt n}{n}$$ we deduce that $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{k+1}}+\sum_{n=1}^{k}\frac{\sqrt{n+1}-\sqrt n}{n}<\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{\sqrt{n+1}-\sqrt n}{n}<\coth^{-1}\left(\sqrt{k+1}\right)+\sum_{n=1}^{k}\frac{\sqrt{n+1}-\sqrt n}{n}$$","Just out of curiosity, I'd like to know whether or not the sum of the series has a known analytic expression.
