0,Why does probability of $n$ consecutive success equal the probability when the last is a failure given that the last $n - 1$ have at least one failure,Why does probability of  consecutive success equal the probability when the last is a failure given that the last  have at least one failure,n n - 1,"I have been the question: Independent trials, each resulting in a success with probability $p$ or a failure with probability $q = 1 - p$ , are performed. We are interested in computing the probability that a run of $n$ consecutive successes occurs before a run of $m$ consecutive failures. This is the given solution: Let $E$ be the event that a run of $n$ consecutive successes occurs before a run of $m$ consecutive failures. To obtain $P(E)$ , we start by conditioning on the outcome of the first trial. That is, letting $H$ denote the event that the first trial results in success, we obtain: $$P(E) = pP(E|H) + qP(E|H^c)$$ Now, given that the first trial was successful, one way we can get a run of $n$ successes before a run of $m$ failures would be to have the next $n - 1$ trials all result in successes. So, let us condition whether or not that occurs. That is, letting $F$ be the even that trials $2$ through $n$ all are successes, we obtain $$P(E|H) = P(E|FH)P(F|H) + P(E|F^cH)P(F^c|H)$$ On the one hand, clearly, $P(E|FH) = 1$ ; on the other hand, if the event $F^cH$ occurs, then the first trial would result in success, but there would be a failure some time during the next $n - 1$ trials. However, when this failure occurs, it would wipe out all of the previous success, and the situation would be exactly as if we started out with a failure. Hence, $$P(E|F^cH) = P(E|H^c)$$ Now I understand why the failure wipes out the entire work, but I don't get why the last equation holds. In particular, $P(E|F^cH)$ means the probability of success given that the last $n - 1$ trials have at least one failure. I don't see how that can reduce to just given the information that the last trial was a failure. For example, if the sequence ends with $...FSSS$ , we also have the information that the last $3$ are successes. Can someone please explain this? I know there is a solution here but I don't get it.

My idea is the following: assume that there exists a quadrangulation of 5 or more vertices that contains two adjacent vertices, both of degree 2.

Then it seems like we cannot join this subgraph with only one vertex to create another subgraph of said quadrangulation, because this would have to contain one of these vertices of degree 2.

So, I can intuitively understand why the first statement is true; The intersection of $A$ and $B$ contains elements that are in both $A$ and $B$ { $x$ : $x \in A$ and $x\in B$ } - The Venn Diagram of such a set would have only the overlapping portion of $A$ and $B$ shaded in. The Relative complement of $B$ in A contains the elements of $A$ that are not elements of $B$ { $x \in A$ : $x \notin B$ } - The Venn diagram of such a set would have only the $A$ circle (excluding the overlapping portion) shaded in. So the intersection of these sets would be the set of elements that are (in both $A$ and $B$ ) and (in $A$ but not $B$ ) which means if $x \in$ $A \cap B$ then $x \notin A \setminus B$ necessarily since $A \setminus B$ contains no elements of the set B by definition - inspecting the corresponding Venn diagrams we see that they have no shaded portions in common. My question for this portion is: how would I go about proving this statement using set theory notation? Would I start by assuming that $x \in A \cap B$ then go to show that this assumption leads to $x \notin A \setminus B$ ? Which would then mean the intersection was $\emptyset$ ? For the second part of the question I, again, have an intuitive understanding of why this is true: For one, inspecting the Venn diagrams we can see that combining the two diagrams leads to the entire circle for $A$ being shaded in which is interpreted as the set $A$ .

68,The minimum size of an edge set that contains an edge of every cycle,The minimum size of an edge set that contains an edge of every cycle,,"The question is like this: There is a connected graph $G=(V,E)$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges such that $m \ge n$ . Let's say that the graph has a spanning tree, meaning there is a tree $T$ such that $T = (V, E_t)$ and $E_t$ contained in $E$ . Find the minimum size $k$ such that a set $F$ exists such that $F \subseteq E$ and these two conditions hold: $|F| = k$ Every cycle in $G$ contains an edge in $F$ . My solution is like: I know that $G$ has a spanning tree $T$ . A tree has $n-1$ edges so for going from $G$ to $T$ i need to erase a set of edges (call it $F$ ) that their size is $m - (n - 1)$ so after i erase them i have a subgraph of $G$ that has $n-1$ edges as needed for it to be a tree. Let's say that there is a cycle in $G$ that doesn't contain an edge in $F$ so after I erase $F$ from $G$ this cycle will remain as it was and that is a contradiction to the assumption that $T$ is a tree. So, as a result of the contradiction it means that $F$ has to be a set of edges that $|F| = k$ and also every cycle in $G$ contain a set in $F$ , now we need to prove that $k$ is the minimum size of a set like this. (Comment: $k = m - (n-1)$ ) Let's say $m - (n-1)$ is not the minimum size, so we have $k < m - (n - 1)$ such that $k$ is the size of a set $F$ that every cycle in $G$ contains a set in $F$ . If we erase $F$ from $G$ we will get a subgraph $G_t$ which has $m - k$ edges so we can say that the number of edges in $G_t$ is bigger than $n-1$ and we know that the number of vertices is $n$ . Because $G$ is a connected graph and every edge that we erase is contained in a cycle in $G$ , we can infer that $G_t$ is a connected graph. Because $G_t$ has more than $n-1$ edges and only $n$ vertices we can infer that $G_t$ is a connected graph that is not a tree and therefore $G_t$ has at least one cycle. If $G_t$ has a cycle, its obvious that there is a cycle in $G$ that does not contain an edge in $F$ . Therefore every group of edges that has more than $m - (n-1)$ edges does not satisfy the conditions. The question is about the last step, if I am erasing an edge of a cycle, couldn't it stay a cycle without the edge? (Maybe if its stays a cycle it means that there is a subcycle in $G$ that doesn't contain an edge in $F$ and a subcycle is a cycle and there is the answer). Just want to make sure, and I already wrote all of this so I will post it maybe it will help other people who faced this question.","The question is like this: There is a connected graph with vertices and edges such that .

On the other hand, to prove that this is a poset, I've tried showing that it's antisymmetric to no avail, and got stuck on that front. for example: $let\,\, R_1,R_2\in\mathcal{R}\,    such\  that\,     R_{1} \sqsubseteq R_{2}$ By the assumption, for all $x,y$ the condition is satisfied, in particular for $\hat{x} ,\hat{y} \in X\ \left(\hat{x} R_{1}\hat{y} \ \rightarrow \hat{x} R_{2}\hat{y}\right)$ then in order for $R_{2} \sqsubseteq R_{1}\,$ to also occur, the condition must also apply for all $x,y\,$ , in particular $\hat{x} R_{2}\hat{y} \ \rightarrow \hat{x} R_{1}\hat{y}$ But this is where I got stuck, I can't seem to get to a conclusion from this point.

So here is my approach: If it is valid , then it's negation must be always false In order this to be always false : assuming ** is always false , so we are in a universe with only one element , but this is not neccessary hence we move to the next case (2) (there are many cases that the statement is true) has to be always false has to be always true which I don't see why if for example P(x,y) is     defined as : ""x is connected to y in a digraph"" in a graph So I came to conculsion, that there are cases in order the negation of the statement to hold true . Hence , it is not valid . Let me know if you agree or if you have another way of thinking of it","\rightarrow \neg[\forall x \forall y (x \neq y \rightarrow (P(x,y) \leftrightarrow \neg P(y,x))) ] \equiv \exists x \exists y(x \neq y \land \neg(P(x,y) \leftrightarrow \neg P(y,x))  x \neq y \neg(P(x,y) \leftrightarrow \neg P(y,x)) \rightarrow (P(x,y) \leftrightarrow \neg P(y,x))","['discrete-mathematics', 'logic', 'relations']"

Then we have $2$ choices for the first digit, $8$ for the last one ( since it's less than $8$ , the last digit $\in [0,7]$ , and since we picked already two digits out of $10$ available there are $8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6 \ldots \cdot 1 = 8!$ for the other digits of the arrangement .
