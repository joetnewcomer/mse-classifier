0,Proving any number of the form $2^n$ can't be written as the sum of k consecutive numbers.,Proving any number of the form  can't be written as the sum of k consecutive numbers.,2^n,"I think i have proved that any number of the form $2^n$ can't be written as the sum of k consecutive positive integers, but i would be grateful if i could have some clarification as to whether this is a correct and valid proof or not. Let $g=x+(x+1)+(x+2)+(x+3)+...+(x+(k-1))$, hence g is the sum of k consecutive positive integers. $g=kx+\sum_{d=1}^{k-1}d$ Hence, $g=kx+\frac{k(k-1)}{2}$ Rearranging for x we find, $x=\frac{g}{k}-\frac{(k-1)}{2}$ So, for certain values of $k$, we can be sure that a positive integer value of $x$ can be found, and hence $g$ can be written as the sum of $k$ consecutive positive integers.There are two cases for $k$ to considor: Case 1) $k$ is odd. If $x$ exists, it must be the case $k$ | $g$, as for odd values of $k$, $\frac{(k-1)}{2}$ will alwyas be an integer, and hence $x$ will. Case 2) $k$ is even. $k$ does not divide $g$, but $\frac{g}{k}$ must be a multiple of $\frac{1}{2}$, and hence equals $\frac{h}{2}$, for some odd $h$. Letting $j=2^n$, assume that we can write $j$ as the sum of $k$ consecutive positive integers. If $k$ is odd, then if a $k$ exists, it must divide $j$, by Case 1. But, $j$ has no odd factors as it is a power of two, hence $k$ could not be odd. If $k$ is even, by Case 2 it mut be the case $k$ does not divide $j$. Also, $\frac{j}{k}=\frac{h}{2}$, for some odd $h$. But, this implies $2j$ has an odd factor, $h$. but, as $2j$ is a power of $2$, it can't have odd factors. So, $k$ can't be odd. Hence, $k$ is neither odd or even, and this is a contradiction to our assumption. Hence no $x$ exists, and hence and number of the form $2^n$ can't be written as the sum of $k$ consecutive positive integers. Any feedback on this proof would be appreciated.","I think i have proved that any number of the form $2^n$ can't be written as the sum of k consecutive positive integers, but i would be grateful if i could have some clarification as to whether this is a correct and valid proof or not.

Edit: Solved #1: Note that if $n=\prod^{k}_{i=1}p_i^{c_i}$, then $\prod^{k}_{i=1}(1+c_i)$ is the number of positive divisors of $n$, since any $p_i$ can occur up to $c_i$ times, or not at all. If $n$ has 105 positive divisors, then $105=\prod^k_{i=1}(1+c_i)$. Note that $105=3\cdot 5\cdot 7$. So, $105=(1+2)(1+4)(1+6)\implies n=p_1^2\cdot p_2^4\cdot p_3^6$.",,"['number-theory', 'elementary-number-theory', 'prime-numbers', 'divisibility', 'prime-factorization']"

98,Generalized Pythagorean triples construction.,Generalized Pythagorean triples construction.,,"All primitive Pythagorean triples $(a, b, c) : \{ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \} \wedge \{ a \equiv 0 \pmod{2} \}$ can be expressed in the form:$$\{ a = 2pq, b = p^2 - q^2, c = p^2 + q^2 \}$$ for positive integers $p, q : \{ \gcd(p,q) = 1 \} \wedge \{ p \not\equiv q \pmod{2} \}$. I conjectured that this also holds for imprimitive Pythagorean triples (in this case $p,q$ are not necessarily relatively prime and of opposite parity). However, I could not find any counterexamples and currently I am stuck in the developing of a proof. That is why I am appealing to you. I would really appreciate any counterexamples, proofs, ideas, etc. Thank you.","All primitive Pythagorean triples $(a, b, c) : \{ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \} \wedge \{ a \equiv 0 \pmod{2} \}$ can be expressed in the form:$$\{ a = 2pq, b = p^2 - q^2, c = p^2 + q^2 \}$$ for positive integers $p, q : \{ \gcd(p,q) = 1 \} \wedge \{ p \not\equiv q \pmod{2} \}$.

99,Numerical verification of the ternary Goldbach conjecture,Numerical verification of the ternary Goldbach conjecture,,"In his proof of the ternary Goldbach conjecture, H.A. Helfgott says that it has been verified that every odd number less than $N_0 = 10^{30}$ is the sum of at most 3 primes. How would one verify this up to $N_0$ in a reasonable amount of time. This is because even if one could verify in $O(1)$ time whether or not a number is the sum of 3 primes, to verify it until $10^{30}$ would still take a very long time.","In his proof of the ternary Goldbach conjecture, H.A.
