14,"Is a countable, totally disconnected Hausdorff space necessarily totally separated? How about zero-dimensional?","Is a countable, totally disconnected Hausdorff space necessarily totally separated? How about zero-dimensional?",,"I'm starting to feel a little bad about using this website as my own personal counterexample generator, but here I go again... Terminology: Let's call a space zero-dimensional if it is $T_0$ and admits a basis of clopen sets. By a standard embedding argument, a space is zero-dimensional if and only if it is homeomorphic to a subspace of some (possibly uncountable) power of the two-point discrete space $\{0,1\}$. In particular, zero-dimensional implies Hausdorff, or even completely regular. Let's call a space $X$ totally separated if, given distinct points $x,y \in X$, there exists a separation $U,V$ of $X$ (ie. $U,V$ partition $X$ and are open) such that $x \in U$ and $y \in V$. In particular, a totally separated space is Hausdorff. Clearly zero-dimensional implies totally separated. Finally, let's call a space totally disconnected if all its connected components are singletons. Clearly totally separated implies totally disconnected (conversely, totally disconnected need not even imply Hausdorff). My question: Let $X$ be a countable, totally disconnected Hausdorff space. Can $X$ fail to be totally separated? If yes, can $X$ fail to be zero-dimensional? Some discussion: If we replace ""countable"" with ""compact, the answer to both questions is ""no"". For a compact Hausdorff space, the components and quasicomponents coincide, so $X$ is totally separated. Then, by applying basic compactness arguments, we can prove even that for all $A,B \subset X$, disjoint closed sets, there is a separation $U,V$ of $X$ with $A \subset U, B \subset V$. In particular, $X$ is zero-dimensional. The hypothesis of compactness cannot be dropped though. For example Cantor's leaky tent is a (noncompact, noncountable) subspace of the Euclidean plane which can be shown, with some effort, to be totally disconnected - but not totally separated. Since the hypothesis of compactness cannot be dropped, I wondered whether it could be replaced with something else. In particular, I wondered whether countable would do. Added: Here's another counterexample. The main idea is the same as in Brian's example, but I thought this space seemed somehow more concrete. As a set, let $X := \mathbb{Q} \cup \{p_0,p_1\}$ where $p_0,p_1$ are two distinct points not in $\mathbb{Q}$. For $n=0,1,2,\ldots$, let $I_n := (n,n+1) \cap \mathbb{Q}$. We put $U \subset X$ open if and only if the following are satisfied: $U \cap \mathbb{Q}$ is open in the standard topology on $\mathbb{Q}$. If $p_0 \in U$, then $U$ contains all but finitely many of $I_0,I_2,I_4,\ldots$ If $p_1 \in U$, then $U$ contains all but finitely many of $I_1,I_3,I_5,\ldots$ It is easy to see this topology is Hausdorff. To see it is totally disconnected, suppose that $C \subset X$ is connected with more than one point. Intervals with irrational endpoints are still clopen, and these can be used to separate a fixed rational number from any other point in $X$. It follows that $C$ contains no rationals. Thus $C = \{p_0,q_0\}$, but this space is discrete ($X$ is Hausdorff), so no such $C$ exists. However, $X$ is not totally separated. Neighbourhoods of $p_0$ and $q_0$ cannot have disjoint closures.","I'm starting to feel a little bad about using this website as my own personal counterexample generator, but here I go again...

Let's call a space $X$ totally separated if, given distinct points $x,y \in X$, there exists a separation $U,V$ of $X$ (ie. $U,V$ partition $X$ and are open) such that $x \in U$ and $y \in V$. In particular, a totally separated space is Hausdorff. Clearly zero-dimensional implies totally separated. Finally, let's call a space totally disconnected if all its connected components are singletons. Clearly totally separated implies totally disconnected (conversely, totally disconnected need not even imply Hausdorff). My question: Let $X$ be a countable, totally disconnected Hausdorff space. Can $X$ fail to be totally separated? If yes, can $X$ fail to be zero-dimensional? Some discussion: If we replace ""countable"" with ""compact, the answer to both questions is ""no"". For a compact Hausdorff space, the components and quasicomponents coincide, so $X$ is totally separated. Then, by applying basic compactness arguments, we can prove even that for all $A,B \subset X$, disjoint closed sets, there is a separation $U,V$ of $X$ with $A \subset U, B \subset V$. In particular, $X$ is zero-dimensional. The hypothesis of compactness cannot be dropped though. For example Cantor's leaky tent is a (noncompact, noncountable) subspace of the Euclidean plane which can be shown, with some effort, to be totally disconnected - but not totally separated. Since the hypothesis of compactness cannot be dropped, I wondered whether it could be replaced with something else. In particular, I wondered whether countable would do. Added: Here's another counterexample. The main idea is the same as in Brian's example, but I thought this space seemed somehow more concrete. As a set, let $X := \mathbb{Q} \cup \{p_0,p_1\}$ where $p_0,p_1$ are two distinct points not in $\mathbb{Q}$. For $n=0,1,2,\ldots$, let $I_n := (n,n+1) \cap \mathbb{Q}$. We put $U \subset X$ open if and only if the following are satisfied: $U \cap \mathbb{Q}$ is open in the standard topology on $\mathbb{Q}$. If $p_0 \in U$, then $U$ contains all but finitely many of $I_0,I_2,I_4,\ldots$ If $p_1 \in U$, then $U$ contains all but finitely many of $I_1,I_3,I_5,\ldots$ It is easy to see this topology is Hausdorff. To see it is totally disconnected, suppose that $C \subset X$ is connected with more than one point. Intervals with irrational endpoints are still clopen, and these can be used to separate a fixed rational number from any other point in $X$. It follows that $C$ contains no rationals. Thus $C = \{p_0,q_0\}$, but this space is discrete ($X$ is Hausdorff), so no such $C$ exists. However, $X$ is not totally separated. Neighbourhoods of $p_0$ and $q_0$ cannot have disjoint closures.",,['general-topology']

A result of this theorem is that the compact Hausdorff topologies are maximal elements in the set of compact topologies and minimal elements of the set of Hausdorff topologies in this lattice. I have been failing to construct an example of a maximal compact topology that is not Hausdorff, but I feel like I am just lacking imagination - it seems unlikely that all maximal compact topologies are Hausdorff. Finite topologies won't work, since the only Hausdorff topology on a finite set is the discrete topology, and, as the maximal element in the lattice, the only maximal compact topology. My intuition is that there must be such examples, but it seems just possible that if a compact set is not Hausdorff, we might be able to create a new compact topology that is larger in the lattice. There is the obvious dual question, too: Is there a minimal element of the set of Hausdorff topologies which is not compact? Just to make the problem self-contained, the result referenced above is: A continuous bijection from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is a   homeomorphism. If $(X,\tau)$ is compact and Hausdorff, and $\tau\subseteq \tau'$ with $\tau'$ also a compact topology, then the identity function $(X,\tau')\to(X,\tau)$ is a continuous bijection from a compact space to a Hausdorff space, so it must be a homeomorphism, which implies $\tau=\tau'$. Similarly, a compact Hausdorff topology is minimal Hausdorff topologies.","In the lattice of topologies on a set $X$, the compact topologies are a lower set in the lattice, while the Hausdorff topologies are an upper set. A result of this theorem is that the compact Hausdorff topologies are maximal elements in the set of compact topologies and minimal elements of the set of Hausdorff topologies in this lattice. I have been failing to construct an example of a maximal compact topology that is not Hausdorff, but I feel like I am just lacking imagination - it seems unlikely that all maximal compact topologies are Hausdorff. Finite topologies won't work, since the only Hausdorff topology on a finite set is the discrete topology, and, as the maximal element in the lattice, the only maximal compact topology. My intuition is that there must be such examples, but it seems just possible that if a compact set is not Hausdorff, we might be able to create a new compact topology that is larger in the lattice. There is the obvious dual question, too: Is there a minimal element of the set of Hausdorff topologies which is not compact? Just to make the problem self-contained, the result referenced above is: A continuous bijection from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is a   homeomorphism. If $(X,\tau)$ is compact and Hausdorff, and $\tau\subseteq \tau'$ with $\tau'$ also a compact topology, then the identity function $(X,\tau')\to(X,\tau)$ is a continuous bijection from a compact space to a Hausdorff space, so it must be a homeomorphism, which implies $\tau=\tau'$.

70,Convex metric on a continuum.,Convex metric on a continuum.,,"I am having troubles with this problem. Translation: A metric $d$ on a continuum is called convex if for any two points $p$ and $q$ of $X$ there is a point $x\in X$ such that $d(p,x)=\frac12d(p,q)=d(q,x)$. Prove that if the metric on $X$ is convex, then the balls are connected, and $X$ is locally connected. Once the balls shown that the balls are connected, the following implication comes for free. My idea is to suppose that there are $x_0\in X$ and $\epsilon_0>0$ such that $B(x_0,\epsilon_0)=\{x\in X:d(x,x_0)<\epsilon_0\}$ is not connected. Then there are $U$ and $V$, open, disjoint, and non-empty, such that $B(x_0,\epsilon_0)=U\cup V$. The next part is complicated to write, but the idea is to construct a Cauchy sequence in $B(x_0,\epsilon_0)$, and since we’re in a compactum it will converge to some element of $X$, which will in fact be in the boundary of $B(x_0,\epsilon_0)$. To do this we suppose without loss of generality that $x_0\in U$. Let $x_1\in V$. Since $d$ is convex there is an $x_2\in X$ such that $d(x_0,x_2)=\frac12d(x_0,x_1)=d(x_1,x_2)$. Then $x_2\in U\cup V$ (since $d(x_0,x_2)<d(x_0,x_1)<\epsilon_0$). If $x_2\in U$, then we look at $x_1\in V$, $x_2\in U$, and there is an $x_3\in X$ such that $d(x_1,x_3)=\frac12d(x_1,x_2)=d(x_2,x_3)$. (Again we see that $x_3\in B(x_0,\epsilon_0)$ and moreover $d(x_0,x_3)<\frac12\epsilon_0$.)

(Again we see that $x_3\in B(x_0,\epsilon_0)$ and moreover $d(x_0,x_3)<\frac12\epsilon_0$.) I hope that the construction of the sequence $(x_n)$ is understood. According to me one can prove that we will have satisfied the following two conditions: i) $d(x_n,x_{n+1})<\frac1{2^n}\epsilon_0$ for all $n$ (so it will be Cauchy) ii) $d(x_0,x_n)<\frac12\epsilon_0$ for all $n$ Then on the one hand we have $(x_n)\to x$ for some $x\in X$. Then $x\in\operatorname{bdry}B(x_0,\epsilon_0)$. But on the other hand $d(x_0,x)\le d(x_0,x_n)+d(x_n,x)<\frac12\epsilon_0+\frac12\epsilon_0=\epsilon_0$ for each $n\ge k$ for some $k\in \mathbb{N}$.

(RI3) If $a < x \le b$ and $[a,x)\subset S$ , then $x \in S$ . Then $S=[a,b]$ .

(This does not correspond exactly to the three conditions above, but if you consider that the property we are trying to prove is "" $[a,x]\subseteq S$ "", then the correspondence between these three bullet points and the conditions (RI1), (RI2), (RI3) seems to be more natural.) The linked text also discusses some generalization of this principle to linearly ordered sets and ordered fields. There is also this question on MathOverflow which asks about generalization to partial orders: A principle of mathematical induction for partially ordered sets with infima? I wonder whether we can generalize this to some context where we do not have ordering. Question. Are there some natural generalizations of the above method to topological spaces or metric spaces? Are there some references where they are studied? Are there some interesting applications? When I tried to mimic the three above conditions, I was only able to come up with this. If $X$ is connected then we get $S=X$ for any set which fulfills these conditions: $S\ne\emptyset$ . If $x\in S$ then there exists an open set $U$ such that $x\in U\subseteq S$ . If $x\in\overline S$ , then $x\in S$ . The second condition only says that $S$ is open. The third condition basically says that $\overline S=S$ , i.e., that $S$ is closed. But I wanted to formulate it in such way that it resembles the formulation of real induction given above. This is a very naive version, since it only says that the only non-empty clopen subset of a connected space $X$ is the whole space. This version seems not very satisfactory since when we view the real induction informally (as described above) as a process in which the set $S$ is ""growing"" until it is the whole $x$ , this is entirely lost in the above formulation. Another reason is that real induction feels a bit like the correct generalization should also be related to compactness. I could try also to define some sets by transfinite induction: $S_0$ is a singleton. $S_{\alpha+1}$ is an open neighborhood os $\overline{S_\alpha}$ . If $\alpha$ is a limit ordinal, then $S_\alpha=\bigcup\limits_{\beta<\alpha} S_\beta$ . The claim would than be that there is an $\alpha$ such that $S_\alpha=X$ . (For example, if $X$ is connected.) This seems a bit closer to my informal description above in the sense, that we have some set which is ""growing"".

78,Which sequences converge in a cofinite topology and what is their limit?,Which sequences converge in a cofinite topology and what is their limit?,,"This is an exercise from an earlier calculus 1 reading at my university: Let $X$ be a space containing infinitely many elements. In the cofinite topology, a set $\Omega$ is open iff $\Omega = \emptyset$ or $\Omega^c$ only contains finitely many elements. Which sequences converge and what is their limit? As I had absolutely no idea how to approach this exercise, I looked up the solution and I found it quite frustrating that I didn't even understand the solution. The writer of the solution states that for any sequence $(a_n)$ in $X$ , there are three possible cases: a) There exists no value which the sequence takes infinitely many times. b) There exists exactly one value which the sequence takes infinitely many times. c) There exist two or more values which the sequence takes infinitely many times. In the first case, the writer further states that the sequence converges to any value $a \in X$ , in the second case, the sequence only converges to the value taken infinitely many times and in the last case, the sequence diverges. Obviously, the writer left out a proof or even a reasoning which might help a reader to understand why this is correct. Can anyone help me out by explaining why this holds true?

86,$f$ is Continuous if and only if its Graph is Closed in $X \times Y$,is Continuous if and only if its Graph is Closed in,f X \times Y,"Let $f: X \to Y$ ; let $Y$ be compact Hausdorff. Then $f$ is continuous if and only if $G_f = \{(x,f(x)) \mid x \in X \}$ is closed. Here is my shot at a proof: Suppose that $f : X \to Y$ is continuous, and let $(x,y) \in \overline{G_f}$ but assume $y \neq f(x)$ . As $Y$ is Hausdorff, there exists $U,V$ open in $Y$ and disjoint such that $y \in U$ and $f(x) \in V$ . Since $V$ is a nbhd of $f(x)$ and $f$ is continuous, there exists an $O \subseteq X$ that is open and contains $x$ such that $f(O) \subseteq V$ . Since $O \times U$ is an open nbhd of $(x,y)$ , there must be some $(p,q) \in G_f \cap O \times U$ . This means $p \in O$ and that $f(p)=q \in U$ . But $f(O) \subseteq V$ , so $U$ and $V$ must intersect--a contradiction. Hence $y= f(x)$ and $G_f$ must be closed. Now we show the other direction. Suppose that $G_f$ is closed, let $x \in X$ be arbitrary, and let $V$ be a open nhbd of $f(x)$ . Then $Y-V$ is closed, and therefore the intersection $C:=G_f \cap [X \times (Y-V)]$ is closed in $X \times Y$ . By an earlier problem, we know that $\pi_1$ is a closed map and so $\pi_1(C)$ is closed in $X$ , and therefore $X-\pi_1(C)$ is open. I will argue that $x \in X-\pi_1(C)$ by contradiction. If $x$ were in $\pi_1(C)$ , then there would exist a $p \in X$ and a $q \in Y-V$ such that $f(p)=q$ and $x= \pi_1(p,f(p))$ or $x=p$ . But this would mean $f(x)=q \in Y-V$ or $f(x) \notin V$ , which contradicts the assumption that $V$ is a nbhd of $f(x)$ . Hence $x \in X - \pi_1(C)$ . Now we argue that $a \in f^{-1}(V)$ if and only if $a \notin a \notin \pi_1(C)$ . Suppose that $a \in \pi_1(C)$ . Then $a = \pi(p,f(p))$ or $a=p$ where $f(p) \in Y-V$ . This means that $f(a) \in Y - V$ and therefore $a \notin f^{-1}(V)$ . Now suppose that $a \notin f^{-1}(V)$ . Then $f(a) \notin V$ and therefore $f(a) \in Y-V$ . From this we get $(a,f(a)) \in G_f \cap [X \times (Y-V)] = C$ which implies $a \in \pi_1(C)$ . From this we can conclude that if $a \in X-\pi_1(C)$ , then $f(a) \in V$ , proving that $f(X-\pi_1(C)) \subseteq V$ which in turn proves that $f$ is continuous.

Ignoring size issues, there is a natural way to view a category as a first-order structure in a finite language. In light of this we can ask about the computational complexity of the first-order theory of a given category. Note that a lot of important structure is lost when passing to the first-order level; nevertheless, it still seems interesting to me. Plenty of categories are easily checked to have very complicated first-order theories - for example, assuming the axiom of choice in the background we can identify the finite sets as those for which every self-injection is a surjection, and since Cartesian products and disjoint unions give the usual arithmetic we have that the first-order theory of the category Sets is not computable. Incidentally, choice isn't needed here, but the non-choice argument is a bit more tedious. My question is: Is the first-order theory of the category Top of topological spaces (with morphisms being continuous maps) computable? My suspicion is that the answer is no. An obvious way to prove this would be to show that the finite discrete spaces are first-order characterizable here, since then we could run the same argument as for Sets ; however, I don't see how to do this. (In particular, the notion of ""compact objcet"" of a category is not obviously first-order expressible, so that characterization of finite discrete spaces doesn't seem to help.) There are weaker versions of this question which could be asked: We could focus on the theory of the categorial equivalence class of Top - that is, the set of sentences true in every category which is categorially equivalent to Top . In general categorial equivalence does not imply elementary equivalence (since a two-element category can be categorially equivalent to a one-element category ), so this is a nontrivial weakening. We could also restrict attention to a subcollection of categories - that is, pin down some non-first-order categorial property $P$ of Top , and then ask for a first-order theory which distinguishes the theory of Top (or the theory of the categorial equivalence class of Top ) within this class . For example, Lawvere's ETCS characterizes Sets up to categorial equivalence amongst the locally small complete categories . I am also interested in comments along these lines; however, my main question is specifically about the first-order theory of Top .

Show that the differential $dm_{(e,e)}:T_eG\oplus T_eG\rightarrow T_eG$ is given by $$dm_{(e,e)}(X,Y)=X+Y$$ This question comes from Lee, introduction to smooth manifolds second edition, problem 7-2. Here is my attempt: $$dm_{(e,e)}(X,Y)f=(X,Y)f(m(e,e))=(X+Y)f(e)$$ I don't think I understand fully what I am doing. The notation makes me dizzy sometimes. My guess is that X+Y is a tangent vector in $T_eG$. Now this vector takes $f\in C^{\infty}(G)$ so I feel like maybe this is ok.","Let $G$ be a Lie group Let $m:G\times G\rightarrow G$ denote the multiplication map.
