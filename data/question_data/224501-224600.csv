1,Utility and meaning of the relative setting in Scheme theory,Utility and meaning of the relative setting in Scheme theory,,"I'm sorry if my question is rather trivial, but I'm starting to learn scheme theory and I have a very basic question. When talking about schemes I see that very often, instead of taking ""a point of a scheme $X$"", is customary to take a $T$-point of $X$ (where $T$ is another scheme) i.e. a morphism $T\rightarrow X$. In this way, under the hypothesis that both $X$ and $T$ are schemes over a field $k$, we obtain a scheme $X\times_k T$ over $T$ (this is also called ""base change"" as I understand). My question is: why is this ""relative setting"" so useful and so what is the importance of the $T$-points? In other words, why can't we just consider usual points, as we do for topological spaces or complex varieties?

15,Unwinding descent via Barr-Beck,Unwinding descent via Barr-Beck,,"Let $f: U \rightarrow X$ be a faithfully flat morphism of nice schemes (quasiseparated, quasicompact, and anything else I might have forgotten).  One can understand descent in quasicoherent sheaves using Barr-Beck for comonads.  The conditions on the theorem are a mild condition on existence of certain equalizers (not an issue) and that $p^*$ is conservative, which (I think) is satisfied by faithfully flatness of $f$.  So we can apply Barr-Beck. Barr-Beck says that $QCoh(X)$ is equivalent to coalgebras over the comonad $T = f^* f_*$ in $QCoh(U)$.  By flat base change, the monad $T = (p_2)_*(p_1)^*$ where $p_i$ are the projections $U \times_X U \rightarrow U$.  A comodule is the data of an object $M$ and a morphism $M \rightarrow T(M)$.  Using the adjunction this morphism is the same as a morphism $\sigma: p_2^* M \rightarrow p_1^*M$. I'm having some trouble unwinding the coherence relations for coalgebras to get them to agree with the usual cocycle condition for descent.  Here is what I want the coherence relations to say.  There are three pullbacks of $M$ to $U \times_X U \times_X U$ and also three ways to pull back $\sigma$ to the category of qcoh sheaves on $U \times_X U \times_X U$.  The easiest way for me to see this is using a 2-simplex: So, on each 0-vertex we have one of the pullbacks of $M$, on each 1-edge we have one of the pullbacks of $\sigma$, and in the middle we have strict equality, i.e. these maps are required to commute on the nose.  This should be the cocycle condition (i.e. that they commute on the nose). Just for reference, the coherence relations for comodules can be expressed by the commuting of the split equalizer: Aside: In particular, the cocycle condition implies that $\sigma$ is an isomorphism; if we think about what this means when restricting to the (1,2,3)-diagonal (points that look like $\{(a,a,a) \mid a \in X\}$, or ""triple intersections of the same open""), all the pullbacks agree, so $\sigma$ is the identity.  If we think about the $(1,3)$-diagonal (i.e. triple intersections where the first and last open are the same), the bottom edge has to be the identity, and the other two edges are just $\sigma$ on the double intersections and this say that the morphism is invertible, i.e. isomorphism.","Let $f: U \rightarrow X$ be a faithfully flat morphism of nice schemes (quasiseparated, quasicompact, and anything else I might have forgotten).  One can understand descent in quasicoherent sheaves using Barr-Beck for comonads.  The conditions on the theorem are a mild condition on existence of certain equalizers (not an issue) and that $p^*$ is conservative, which (I think) is satisfied by faithfully flatness of $f$.  So we can apply Barr-Beck. Barr-Beck says that $QCoh(X)$ is equivalent to coalgebras over the comonad $T = f^* f_*$ in $QCoh(U)$.  By flat base change, the monad $T = (p_2)_*(p_1)^*$ where $p_i$ are the projections $U \times_X U \rightarrow U$.  A comodule is the data of an object $M$ and a morphism $M \rightarrow T(M)$.

Namely, we have a complete DVR R with maximal ideal $(\pi)$, field of fractions K, and algebraically closed residue field k of prime characteristic p. We let $Y = (Spf R[[z]]) \otimes K$ be an open rigid disk over K, with $G$ a finite p-group of automorphisms of $Y$ that has a nonempty number of fixed points. We denote the set of fixed points by $\Delta$. We let $D \subset Y$ be the smallest closed disk that contains $\Delta$. The part I don't understand is that Brewis writes we can find a finite family $(E_j)_{j \in J}$ of residue classes $E_j \subset D$ such that $E_j \cap \Delta \neq \emptyset$ and that $\cup_j E_j = D$. How do we know that this can be done? In the context of this paper, we are inducting on the cardinality of $\Delta$, and so this finite cover by residue classes cannot just be one set equal to $D$. I assumed residue class refers to the residue class of an element, i.e. the set of points that have the same image in the special fiber as a given point. Via translation, we should be able to assume WLoG that $D = \{z : v(z) \geq n\}$ where $v$ is the order of $z$ with respect to the uniformizer $\pi$, and where $n \in \mathbb{N}$ is fixed. In such a case, I don't see how we can get a finite cover by residue classes. As n is positive ($Y$ is open) and $E_j$ is assumed to be in $D$, it would seem to me that we may only consider the residue class of an element in the ideal $(\pi)$, at which point we will have all of $D$ (and possibly more) in the residue class. Might the residue class refer instead to open sets about a point of the form $\{z : |z-a| < p^{-n}\}$? In that case, because the residue field is infinite, I am still unsure how to get a finite cover by residue classes.

Question4: Find the intersection divisor of the Fermat Curve with the curve z=0. Question5: Compute ($x^i y^j$/$z^i z^j$) Where i and j are non-negative integers. Question6: What is the restriction on div($x^i y^j$/$z^i z^j$ so that it is in L(D) Attempt: Q1: By Riemann-Roch theorem if deg(D)>2g-2 => dim(L(D))=deg(d)-g+1 where g is the genus. Since the genus is 1. deg(D)>2(1)-2 or deg(D)>0 using D from above we get deg(k$P_\infty$)+deg(k$P^1_\infty$)=k(1)+k(2). Since k>0 => deg(d)>0. So we can use the Riemann-Rock theorem. So dim(L(D))=deg(k$P_\infty$)+deg(k$P^1_\infty$)-g+1 =>k+2k-1+1=3k. Q2:The curve x=0 does not meet with the divisor(s) of the Fermat Curve.

I would appreciate if someone corrects my attempt. Note here that the question has 3 parts... Question : Let $Y$ be an integral scheme (a scheme that is reduced and irreducible), and $U$ be a non-empty open subscheme. Let $I$ be a non-empty index and for all $i\in I$, we let $U_{i}:=U_{ii}=Y$ and $U_{ij}=U$ if $i\neq j$. Let $\phi_{ji}:U_{ij}\rightarrow U_{ji}$ be the identity map and $X$ be a scheme glued along $\phi_{ij}$. 1) We need to show that for all $V$ open subset of $X$, and for all $i\in I$, we have an isomorphism $\Gamma(V,\mathcal{O}_{X})\rightarrow \Gamma(V\cap U_{i},\mathcal{O}_{X})$. Attempt Since $Y$ is irreducible and closed, so it has a generic point $\eta$ which lies in every open set, and therefore it lies in $U$. Then $X$ has a generic point which is $\eta$ as well. I consider the inclusion of schemes $i:U_{i}\rightarrow X$. Therefore, this induces the morphism of function fields: $\displaystyle i^{\#}_{\eta}:\mathcal{O}_{X,\eta}\rightarrow \mathcal{O}_{U_{i},\eta},$ which is an isomorphism (I think? because $U_{i}\subseteq X$). Therefore, for each $x\in X$, we have an isomorphism $\mbox{Frac}(\mathcal{O}_{X,x})\rightarrow \mbox{Frac}((i_{*}\mathcal{O}_{U_{i}})_{x})$, and hence (I believe this to be true) an isomorphism of stalks $i^{\#}_{x}: \mathcal{O}_{X,x}\rightarrow (i_{*}\mathcal{O}_{U_{i}})_{x}$. This means that $i^{\#}:\mathcal{O}_{X}\rightarrow i_{*}\mathcal{O}_{U_{i}}$ is an isomorphism (at this stage I only know that this is a bijection, so I am taking a leap of faith here and conclude that it is an isomorphism), which is exactly what we want (I hope). 2) Assume that $U\neq Y$, conclude from (1) that $X$ is not an affine scheme. Attempt I am stuck on this one for a long time, and this is the best I can come up with. If $X=(\mbox{Spec}A,\mathcal{O}_{\mbox{Spec}A})$, using the previous result, we have an isomorphism $A\rightarrow \Gamma(X\cap U_{i},\mathcal{O}_{X})=\Gamma(U_{i},\mathcal{O}_{U_{i}})=\Gamma(Y,\mathcal{O}_{Y})$. Now, we set $V=U_{j}$ where $j\neq i$. Then again we have an isomorphism $\Gamma(Y,\mathcal{O}_{Y})=\Gamma(U_{j},\mathcal{O}_{X})\rightarrow\Gamma(U_{i}\cap U_{j},\mathcal{O}_{X})=\Gamma(U,\mathcal{O}_{X})$ (I think this isomorphism is fishy but I will take it with faith). Now my hope is that since $U$ is a proper open subset of $X$, and $X$ is an affine scheme, the restriction to proper open subset of $\mbox{Spec}A$ will never induce an isomorphism of sections. But this is what we see since $\Gamma(X,\mathcal{O}_{X})\cong \Gamma(U,\mathcal{O}_{X})$. 3) Now assume $Y$ is a noetherian scheme and $U\neq Y$. Prove that $X$ is integral and locally Noetherian. Furthermore, show that $X$ is quasi-compact if and only if the indexing set $I$ is finite. To show that $X$ is quasi-compact if the indexing set is finite, this comes from the fact that $Y$ is quasi-compact. To show that $X$ is locally noetherian, since $Y$ admits an open affine covering $V_{i}$ such that $\Gamma(V_{i},\mathcal{O}_{Y})$ is noetherian, so $X$ admits an open affine covering, where the section of each of the covering open affine subset is noetherian.
