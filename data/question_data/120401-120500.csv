It is easier to explain this using examples: $r(2,1)$ is 1, as the maximal radius $r$ of a single sphere that should be embedded in the subset of the unit sphere containing all points whose distance from 0 lies in the interval $[1-2r,1]$ is simply 1 (in which case, the said subset is the unit sphere itself). In fact, $r(n,1)=1$ for any $n\ge 2$. $r(2,2)$ is 0.5, as one can pack 2 0.5-radius spheres inside the unit sphere. I guess $r(n,2)=0.5$ for any $n\ge 2$. $r(2,3)$ is ... well, I already don't know that. What I do know ( know might be too harsh here) is that: $$\lim_{k->\infty}k\cdot r(2,k)=\pi$$ And that makes me guess $k\cdot r(2,k)$ is an increasing function, going from 1 to $\pi$. A more general limit can be described as follows: the limit of ratio of the sum of all surface areas of all packed spheres, and the surface area of the unit sphere.

Let $S$ be a set of lines in the real affine plane, with the following properties $S$ is finite, there are at least two points in which some pair of lines from $S$ intersect. Does this imply that there is at least one point where exactly two lines of $S$ intersect? Another way of formulating this is: assuming $S$ is finite, and that whenever two lines of $S$ intersect there is at least one more line of $S$ passing throught the point of intersection; does it follow that the lines of $S$ are either all parallel or all pass through a single point? The statement is true in the real projective plane; this is a result due to E. Melchior (1940) that can be proved by counting intersection points, line segments and faces of the line arrangement, and the known Euler characterisitic of the projective plane. In fact the proof, cited here , shows that there are at least three ""ordinary"" points of intersection (where two but no more lines of $S$ intersect). However, applying this to a configuration in the affine plane, it is conceivable that these ordinary points are all at infinity, and so only correspond to a pair of parallel lines in $S$ rather than to an ordinary point of affine intersection. If one could show that projectively there are at least three non collinear ordinary points, then this would prove the affine form; however it would seem unlikely that the proof by Euler characteristic leads to such a sharpening. Should all ordinary points be at infinity, then one can make them non-ordinary by adding the line at infinity to the configuration, but this could introduce new ordinary points at infinity, and this does not seem to give the desired result. Directly applying the Euler characterisitc argument to the affine configuration seems hard as well, since there can for instance be a large number of faces bounded by only two segments. So it could be that the affine result is false, but trying to construct a counterexample certainly suggests it is true. One configuration with only a single ordinary point consists of  the four sides of a parallelogram and its two diagonals. Adding more lines to the configuration appears to inevitably make things worse, but I can see no simple reason why it necessarily should. I'd finally like to note, to explain my title, that the dual result is known as the Sylvester-Gallai theorem : it says that for any finite collection of points not all on the same line there is at least one line that contains exactly two of them. This result does not suffer from a distinction between the affine and projective case: the affine case implies the projective one by choosing a line meeting none of the points as line at infinity, and the projective case implies the affine case because for a finite collection of points in the affine plane, the line containing two of them, which the projective version of the result gives, obviously cannot be the line at infinity.","The following question came up in the course of this recent question .

Then I 'round' the angle to 45 degrees, and draw a line to a 45 degrees constrained version of the original angle, and keep the same length for the line. This isn't very good way to do it, especially for consecutive lines with similar angles. Here are some tests: The faded red is the original, the green is the estimation. @Américo Tavares's suggestion is great though. I could use this approach for bitmap graphics too, not just vector graphics. If I would go with this approach, I imagine I would do something like: get a mosaic(create a grid of boxes to cover the size of the shape) boxes_xnum = floor(w/box_size) boxes_ynum = floor(h/box_size) for(y to boxes_ynum):     for(x to boxes_xnum):         grid.addBitmap(copyPixels(source,x*box_size,y*box_size,box_size,box_size));//copypixels(source,x,y,width,height)  for box in grid:    if(box.nonAlphaPixels/box.totalPixels > .75): fullBox    else:         checkDiagonalType()//is it like this / or like this \         checkFillSide()//which of the two sides should be filled         //which means I should check for something constrained to 45 degrees angles \| or _\ or |/ or /_         //in the case of halfs go for random diagonal ? If I think about this better, when I loop though the pixels of a box, keep a pixel count per box 'quadrant'(top-left). If the non transparent pixels in one quadrant in larger than .5 or .75 it's marked as used. Based on how many and which of the 4 quadrants are used in a box, a diagonal with direction is used. Does this make sense, or am I over complicating this ?","If I have an arbitrary shape, I would like to fill it only with $45-45-90$ triangles. The aim is to get a Tangram look, so it's related to this question . Starting with $45-45-90$ triangles would be an amazing start. After the shape if filled I imagine I could pick adjacent triangles, either $2$ or $4$ and draw squares and parallelograms instead, but just getting the outline estimated with packed $45-45-90$ triangles would be great. How do I get started ? EDIT @J.M.'s comment makes perfect sense, which means I should first make sure my shape is suited for this. Here's a sketch I did to illustrate this: The black shape is the 'arbitrary shape', the blue path is the path I should be filling.

96,Finding a sequence of tangent circles with integer radii,Finding a sequence of tangent circles with integer radii,,"I asked this over in the puzzling SE and it has since been solved there. The question is best asked with a visual: I am looking to find a sequence (of any length) of strictly decreasing (strictly because otherwise you can pick seven 1s and pack a hex lattice) integer radii such that the final circle perfectly covers the central one. In other words, such that it is also tangent to the second circle (the first non-central). The above image is the closest I've been able to brute force search (20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 14, 8, 5, 4, 3, 2), it misses by about 5.39x10e-6. My search would be sped up if I knew more about how to do a weird version of Newton-Raphson with binary string permutations. Take the above example. I can encode the sequence like this (ignoring the central circle/implying its size by the length of the string): 1111010000010011110. It is the smallest binary number with ten 1s that overlaps with the rightmost circle. The previous lexicographical permutation (1111010000010011101) should(?) represent the largest binary representation that does not overlap. For a given central radius and number of surrounding circles, there should exist a pair of sequences that are lexicographically adjacent that span this overlap. I have a way to increment a binary string permutation, but have not found a way to find the midpoint of two distinct lexicographic permutations. That would speed up my search immensely and allow me to employ a bit of N-R.* Edit: I'm becoming very skeptical of the above assertion the more I examine it, but I'll leave it up in case it helps on any level.","I asked this over in the puzzling SE and it has since been solved there.
