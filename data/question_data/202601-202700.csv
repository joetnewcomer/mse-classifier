If at any time instant $t$, this undescribed mechanism records all values of speeds over the surface without repetition as follows $\mathscr{V}=[v_1,v_2,...,v_n]$ Then for some $v\in \mathscr{V}$, can we draw level set-type plots on the surface by joining all points having same speed $v$ by a curve on the surface such that:- a) if such curves exist, they necessarily form closed loops? b) And there are non-zero number ( meaning at least one or more ) of closed contours on the surface?

One example would be a real life hollow sphere, whose mean surface is a 2-sphere, but whose wall has non-zero ""thickness"". What is the correct notion of curvature (intrinsic as well as extrinsic) for such entities? From what (little) I know, such an object is a ""3-manifold with boundary"" so does one need to apply the definition of curvatures that apply to 3 manifolds, making the curvature a tensor?  In that case, would the Gauss (scalar) curvature of such an object be 0? Thanks in advance.",,"['differential-geometry', 'riemannian-geometry', 'surfaces', 'curvature']"

So we can extend a vector $\xi\in T_eG$ to the vector field on $G$ by this way: $$X(g)=dL_g(\xi),\mbox{for any }g\in G$$ where $X(g)$ is a vecotr at $g$, $L_g:G\rightarrow G$ is the left translation, and $dL_g:T_eG\rightarrow T_gG$ is the pushforward.

73,"Different Definitions of Tensor product, Halmos, Formal Sums, Universal Property","Different Definitions of Tensor product, Halmos, Formal Sums, Universal Property",,"In the classic Finite-Dimensional Vector Spaces by P. Halmos he defines the Tensor product as The tensor product $U \otimes V$ of two finite-dimensional vector spaces $U$ and $V$ (over the same field) is the dual of the vector space of all bilinear forms on $U \oplus V$ [remark, by this he means all bilinear maps $\omega : U \times V \to \mathbb F$]. For each pair $x$ and $y$, with $x$ in $U$ and $y$ in $V$, the tensor product $z = x \otimes y$ of $x$ and $y$ is the element of $U \oplus V$ defined by $z(w) = w(x,y)$ for every bilinear form $w$. Another construction, for example here or on Wikipedia , the tensor product is defined as the set of all formal sums on $U \times V$ modulo certain (''bilinear'') identities. This is equivalent to the set of all formal sums on $\{ u_i \}_{i\in I} \times \{ v_j \}_{j \in J}$ for bases $u_i$ and $v_j$ of $U$ and $V$. According to my first reference , the set of all multilinear maps $V_1 \times \ldots \times V_k \to \mathbb F$ could be identified with $V_1^* \otimes \ldots \otimes V_k^*$, this seems always possible (not requiring finite dimensions), so in particular the set of all bilinear maps $U \times V \to \mathbb F$ could be identified with $V^* \otimes U^*$, so in Halmos definition the tensor product equals $(V^* \otimes U^*)^*$, where the tensor product is defined as the set of formals sums as above. But to make sense, this definition must equal the definition by formal sums, so we must have $(V^* \otimes U^*)^* \cong V \otimes U$ to bring Halmos definition and the definition by formal sums in harmony. But I guess here seems to be some sort of reflexivity involved, so he might used the finite-dimensionality of the vector spaces, or could Halmos definiton further extended, does I got it right? Still another construction I found is by the following universal property (see also Wikipedia ), i.e. the tensor product of two vector spaces $U$ and $V$ is such that for each bilinear map $U \times V \to W$ there exists exactly one linear map $U \otimes V \to W$, and this correspondence is linear, i.e. we have $$  \mbox{Bil}(U, V; W) \cong \mbox{Hom}(U\otimes V, W). $$ In our case $W = \mathbb F$ the ground field, then $$  \mbox{Bil}(U, V; \mathbb F) \cong (U\otimes V)^* $$ But by Halmos definition the tensor product equals $\mbox{Bil}(U, V; \mathbb F)^*$, so again this seems require some sort of reflexivity, i.e. $((U \otimes V)^*)^* \cong (U\otimes V)$. But here the property to bring the definitions together reads still a little bit different, to make them all the same we need $(U^* \otimes V^*) \cong (U\otimes V)^*$, but this holds in general vector spaces, as $(U^* \otimes V^*) \cong \mbox{Bil}(U, V; F) \cong (U \otimes V)^*$. So my questions again: 1) does I got everything right?, 2) am I right that Halmos definition is limited, and how far could we go with it, is reflexivity the right property to demand?","In the classic Finite-Dimensional Vector Spaces by P.

For each pair $x$ and $y$, with $x$ in $U$ and $y$ in $V$, the tensor product $z = x \otimes y$ of $x$ and $y$ is the element of $U \oplus V$ defined by $z(w) = w(x,y)$ for every bilinear form $w$. Another construction, for example here or on Wikipedia , the tensor product is defined as the set of all formal sums on $U \times V$ modulo certain (''bilinear'') identities. This is equivalent to the set of all formal sums on $\{ u_i \}_{i\in I} \times \{ v_j \}_{j \in J}$ for bases $u_i$ and $v_j$ of $U$ and $V$. According to my first reference , the set of all multilinear maps $V_1 \times \ldots \times V_k \to \mathbb F$ could be identified with $V_1^* \otimes \ldots \otimes V_k^*$, this seems always possible (not requiring finite dimensions), so in particular the set of all bilinear maps $U \times V \to \mathbb F$ could be identified with $V^* \otimes U^*$, so in Halmos definition the tensor product equals $(V^* \otimes U^*)^*$, where the tensor product is defined as the set of formals sums as above. But to make sense, this definition must equal the definition by formal sums, so we must have $(V^* \otimes U^*)^* \cong V \otimes U$ to bring Halmos definition and the definition by formal sums in harmony. But I guess here seems to be some sort of reflexivity involved, so he might used the finite-dimensionality of the vector spaces, or could Halmos definiton further extended, does I got it right? Still another construction I found is by the following universal property (see also Wikipedia ), i.e. the tensor product of two vector spaces $U$ and $V$ is such that for each bilinear map $U \times V \to W$ there exists exactly one linear map $U \otimes V \to W$, and this correspondence is linear, i.e. we have $$  \mbox{Bil}(U, V; W) \cong \mbox{Hom}(U\otimes V, W). $$ In our case $W = \mathbb F$ the ground field, then $$  \mbox{Bil}(U, V; \mathbb F) \cong (U\otimes V)^* $$ But by Halmos definition the tensor product equals $\mbox{Bil}(U, V; \mathbb F)^*$, so again this seems require some sort of reflexivity, i.e. $((U \otimes V)^*)^* \cong (U\otimes V)$. But here the property to bring the definitions together reads still a little bit different, to make them all the same we need $(U^* \otimes V^*) \cong (U\otimes V)^*$, but this holds in general vector spaces, as $(U^* \otimes V^*) \cong \mbox{Bil}(U, V; F) \cong (U \otimes V)^*$. So my questions again: 1) does I got everything right?, 2) am I right that Halmos definition is limited, and how far could we go with it, is reflexivity the right property to demand?",,"['linear-algebra', 'differential-geometry', 'tensor-products', 'multilinear-algebra']"

Denote the Frenet trihedron of $\boldsymbol{\alpha}(s)$ at $\bf{p}$ by $\bf{t}_{\alpha}$, $\bf{n}_{\alpha}$, $\bf{b}_{\alpha}$; the Frenet trihedron of $\boldsymbol{\beta}(s)$ at $\bf{p}$ by $\bf{t}_{\beta}$, $\bf{n}_{\beta}$, $\bf{b}_{\beta}$. Suppose both curves have the same osculating plane at $\bf{p}$ and the osculating plane is not equal to the tangent plane at $\bf{p}$. i) Show that $\bf{t}_{\alpha}$ and $\bf{t}_{\beta}$ are parallel, i.e. $\bf{t}_{\alpha} = \pm\bf{t}_{\beta}$. ii) Show that $\bf{n}_{\alpha}$ and $\bf{n}_{\beta}$ are parallel, i.e. $\bf{n}_{\alpha} = \pm\bf{n}_{\beta}$. iii) Show that both curves have the same curvature at $\bf{p}$. I have only succeeded in showing i), where the strategy was to first assume they are not parallel. Taking the cross product of the two tangent vectors would then produce the normal of the osculating plane, a non-zero vector parallel to the Gauss map at $\bf{p}$. Since the tangent plane at $\bf{p}$ is defined by the normal vector at $\bf{p}$, i.e. the Gauss map, this implies that the osculating plane is the same as the tangent plane, which contradicts the setup.

If we have a metric tensor $g_{\mu\nu}$ and so: $dx^2=g_{\mu\nu}dx^{\mu}dx^{nu}$ what is the new expression of the cosine theorem in the new space?

It says: For $c:(a,b)$ $\rightarrow$ $M$ and function $f: M$ $\rightarrow$ $\mathbb{R}$ where $(a,b)$ is an open interval containing $t=0$. We define the tangent vector at $c(0)$ as a direction derivative of a function $f(c(t))$ along the curve $c(t)$ at $t=0$. The rate of change of $f(c(t))$ at $t=0$ along the curve is $$\left. \frac{df(c(t))}{dt} \right|_{t=0}.$$ In terms of the local coordinate, this becomes $$\left. \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^{\mu}}\frac{dx^{\mu}(c(t))}{dt} \right|_{t=0}$$ where $M$ is of course a manifold with chart $(U,\phi)$ and so $f \circ \phi^{-1} : \mathbb{R}^{m} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$.
