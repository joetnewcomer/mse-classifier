1,Doubt in Scheffe's Lemma,Doubt in Scheffe's Lemma,,"While reading up on ""Glivenko Cantelli Theorem"" from Probability Models by K.B Athreya, the author used 2 lemmae to prove it. One was called Scheffe's lemma, the other Polya's theorem. Scheffe's Lemma is stated as follows: Let $f_n, f$ be non negative $\mu$ integrable functions. If $f_n \to f$ a.e and $\int f_n d\mu \to \int fd\mu$, then  $$\int |f_n - f|d\mu \to 0$$ My proof is: Let $g_n = |f_n -f|$. Now we have $g_n \to 0$ a.e. Now  $$0 \leq g_n = |f_n -f| \leq f + f_n$$ $$\Rightarrow \int g_n d\mu \leq \int fd\mu + \int f_nd\mu < \infty $$ Thus by Dominated convergence theorem, $$\int g_nd\mu \to 0$$ QED. The Question : My doubt is that in this proof, I have not used that $\int f_n d\mu \to \int fd\mu$, at least not explicitly. So is this condition superfluous? What I searched : I searched for Scheffe on MSE, but got 3 results (none useful) and when I typed Scheffe's instead, I got a result not belonging to these 3 which was actually on Scheffe's lemma (Though not helpful). It's strange (not the result but the search). I'd appreciate any help/hints on this. Kindly ask me for clarifications if required.","While reading up on ""Glivenko Cantelli Theorem"" from Probability Models by K.B Athreya, the author used 2 lemmae to prove it.

For this   reason, one considers instead a smaller collection of privileged   subsets of $X$. These subsets will be called the measurable sets.

That's obviously one of many possible measures we can use. AFAIK, I can have a sigma-algebra that contains Vitali set. Everything can be a sigma-algebra, as long as it satisfies its 3 simple axioms.

Let $(X, \mathcal F, \mu)$ be a $\sigma$-finite measure space and $T:X\to X$ be a measure preserving transformation.   Let $f\in L^1(X, \mu)$.   Then $(1/N)\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}f(T^nx)$ converges almost everywhere to an $L^1(X, \mu)$-function $f^*$.   Further, we have $f^*\circ T=f^*$ and if $X$ is a finite measure space than $\int_Xf^*\ d\mu=\int_Xf\ d\mu$. These are some applications of the Birkhoff ergodic theorem that I know of: Here is a proof of the law of large numbers using the Ergodic theorem If $P$ is the transition matrix of a finite state space Markov chain having a strictly positive stationary distribution, then the limit $$ Q:=\lim_{N\to \infty} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} P^n $$ exists. The matrix $Q$ is a stochastic matrix and satisfies $QP=PQ=Q$, and $Q^2=Q$. This has applications to Markov chains. A proof can be found in Peter Walter's An Introduction to Ergodic Theory (Lemma 1.18) Almost all numbers in $[0, 1)$ are normal in base 2, that is, for almost all $x$ in $[0, 1)$ the frequency of $1$'s in the binary expansion of $x$ is $1/2$. (For a proof see Theorem 1.15 in Peter Walter's An Introduction to Ergodic Theory ).

I'm willing to offer bounty for this. $1.$ Consider the following theorem: There is no function $f:\mathcal{P}\left(\mathbb{R}\right)\rightarrow\left[0,\infty\right]$ that is translation-invariant and $\sigma$-additive such that $0<f\left(\left(0,1\right)\right) < \infty$. Its proof goes like this: We first define a equivalence relation $a\sim b:\Leftrightarrow a-b\in\mathbb{Q}$ on $\mathbb{R}$, then select a system $S$ of representatives from it that lies in $\left(0,1\right)$. This $S$ is then the key to prove the theorem. What I'm concerned with is how we obtain $S$. The proof I know says ""we have to use the axiom of choice to do that'': The choice function picks member from every an equivalence class. As I understand it the use of the axiom of choice comes from the fact that we can't determine explicitly the form of the set all the equivalence classes (if we have one representative we can easily get one that lies in the open unit interval). Each equivalence class has to have the form $a+\mathbb{Q}$ for some real $a$ and it is clear that the equivalence class of any rational number is $\mathbb{Q}$. But the irrational numbers cause problem: We have no means to explicitly describe all equivalence classes of irrational numbers, since for a given $b,c\in\mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Q}$, we don't know if they are in the same equivalence class or not: $1+\sqrt{2}$ and $2+\sqrt{2}$ obviously are; but for $\pi$ and $e$ we don't know, since currently it is unknown whether $\pi-e$ is rational or not. Now the axiom of choice circumvents this issue. But the need to use the axiom of choice seems to me to depend in this case only on present state of research: Maybe in 100 years we will settle the case for $\pi$ and $e$ and moreover devise some methods such that for given $b,c\in\mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Q}$ we know if they are in the same equivalence class or not (for example if it turns out that we can somehow classify them we can distinguish by cases). Therefore saying we have to use the axiom of choice seems bad to me; saying ""presently we cannot do without the axiom of choice"" seems better. $2.$ The above seems to me to be in contrast to saying ""we have to use the axiom of choice to exhibit a functions that picks an element from every subset of the reals"" since I read, that there there are strong model-theoretic arguments that imply that indeed no one will ever be able to explicitly construct such a function. But even in this case it seems to me, that the word ""have"" is too strong, since it implies that one can somehow prove that without the axiom of choice it is impossible to prove that statement. $3.$ Is proving, that a statement $T$ cannot be proven without the axiom of choice the same as proving that $T$ is equivalent to the axiom of choice ?

Define the map $\varphi\colon \mathbb{R}^n\to [0,\infty]$ by $\varphi(x)=\mu(x+V)$, where $x+V$ is the translation of $V$ by $x$. I am told that $\varphi$ is lower semi-continuous, provided that $\mu$ is finite. I have produced a proof of this, but my proof doesn't seem to use the finiteness assumption. This goes roughly as follows: suppose $x_0\in\varphi^{-1}((\alpha,\infty))$ isn't an interior point. This gives a sequence $y_n$, converging to $x_0$, with $\varphi(y_n)\leq\alpha$.

86,Problems with Set Function,Problems with Set Function,,"(Questions are at the bottom of the post. I’ve added two more doubts since the recent answer.) Introduction Consider $f:A\to\mathbb{R}$ where $A\subseteq[a,b]$ , $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ and $S$ is a fixed subset of $A$ . Before mentioning my set function, it is important to know I need it to compute my average. The average should satisfy the following Positivity: If $f>0$ , $\operatorname{average}(A,f)>0$ . Linearity: $\operatorname{average}(A,f+g)=\operatorname{average}(A,f)+\operatorname{average}(A,g)$ , and $\operatorname{average}(A,cf(x))$ is $c \times\text{average}(A,f(x))$ . As $f\to\text{constant function}$ , $\operatorname{average}(A,f)\to\text{constant}$ The $\operatorname{average}{(A,f)}$ should give a defined, unique value when $f$ is defined on a measurable set. Take for example functions defined on Lebesgue measurable sets. The average of $f$ should satisfy $\inf f \le \operatorname{average} (A,f) \le \sup f$ when $f$ is defined on measurable sets. The Average defined by the Lebesgue Measure and Integral does not fit all the requirements. If $\lambda(A)$ is the Lebesgue Measure of $A$ and $\lambda(A)=0$ , then the average of $f$ is undefined breaking rules 4 and 5. I wish to define an average that matches all the rules and gives the following. When $\lambda(A)>0$ , the average should be the Lebesgue Average. When $A$ is finite the average of $f$ should be $$\frac{1}{|A|}\sum_{x\in A}f(x)$$ When $A$ is infinite and $\lambda(A)=0$ , divide $[a,b]$ into $r$ equal sub-intervals. Take the average of $f$ over the infimum of all sub-intervals that meet $A$ . Call this the lower average. Take the average of $f$ over the supremum of all sub-intervals that meet $A$ . Call this the upper average. As $r\to\infty$ , if the lower and upper average meet at the same value, call this the total average. When the total average is defined it should equal the average I want to define. There are cases of $f$ where neither of these averages can give a defined value. Rather we generalize these definitions into my average and see that supports rules 4. and 5. The problem may not be well-defined since an average may be unable to exist on all zero Lebesgue Measure sets. However, before working on my average, I would like to work on my set function which I shall use to compute my average. Note the set function I am defining may not be a measure. It could be finitely additive but give positive values for sets with zero Lebesgue measure. Definition of Outer Set Function $\mu^{*}(c,S)$ If we define the following: $I=[a,b]$ $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$ $\left(I_k\right)_{k=1}^{m}$ are $m$ open sub-intervals of $I$ $\ell(I)=b-a$ is the length of $I$ $\ell(I_k)=c\in\mathbb{R}^{+}$ is the length of $I_k$ for $k=1,...,m$ $$\Omega(S\cap I_k)=\begin{cases}  0 & S\cap I_k \ \text{is countable}\\ 1 & S\cap I_k \ \text{is uncountable} \\  \end{cases}$$ then $\mu^{*}(c,S)$ is the outer piece-wise set function defined as \begin{align*} & \mu^{*}(c,S)=  \begin{cases}\inf\limits_{m\in\mathbb{N}}\left\{ \sum\limits_{k=1}^{m}c\ \Omega\left(S\cap I_{k}\right): S\subseteq\bigcup\limits_{k=1}^{m}I_{k}\right\} & A \ \text{is uncountable}\\ \inf\limits_{m\in\mathbb{N}}\left\{\sum\limits_{k=1}^{m}c : S\subseteq\bigcup\limits_{k=1}^{m}I_{k} \right\} & A \ \text{is countable}\\ \end{cases} \end{align*} Explanation of $\mu^{*}(c,S)$ (Skip if you understand my definition) The parameter $c$ must remain a variable throughout the computation of $\mu^{*}(c,S)$ . When $A$ is uncountable, $\mu^{*}(c,S)$ should equal $cm^{\prime}_{\text{min}}$ , where $m^{\prime}_{\text{min}}$ is the minimum number of $I_k$ that cover $S$ for $k$ where $S\cap I_k$ is uncountable. The reason we set some $I_k$ to lengths zero is that countable subsets of $A$ , such as countable $S\cap I_k$ , are regarded to be as small as the null set compared to the uncountable set. Hence we ""prevent"" corresponding $I_k$ from covering this part of $S$ by setting their ""lengths"" to zero instead of $c$ . When $A$ is countable $\mu^{*}(c,S)$ should equal $cm_{\text{min}}$ where $m_{\text{min}}$ is the minimum number of $I_k$ that can cover $S$ . Here $S\cap I_k$ can be countable (instead of uncountable). When $A$ is countable, we do not set the length of any $I_k$ to be zero, since countable subsets of countable $A$ , should be covered by $I_k$ such that the total length of $I_k$ should have a positive proportional value to $\mu^{*}(c,A)$ .

Here are a few more things I need resolved. When $A=[a,b]$ , does my set function of $S$ equal the Lebesgue measure of $S$ . If $A=\mathbb{Q}$ could we solve $\lim_{c\to 0} \mu(c,S)$ by doing the following: Take elements of $S$ that have $n$ decimal places. Take $\lim\limits_{c\to 0}\mu$ of these elements as $n\to\infty$ . If we cannot do this, how can we change my definition of $\lim\limits_{c\to 0}\mu(c,S)$ so this is possible.","(Questions are at the bottom of the post. I’ve added two more doubts since the recent answer.) Introduction Consider where , and is a fixed subset of . Before mentioning my set function, it is important to know I need it to compute my average. The average should satisfy the following Positivity: If , . Linearity: , and is . As , The should give a defined, unique value when is defined on a measurable set. Take for example functions defined on Lebesgue measurable sets. The average of should satisfy when is defined on measurable sets. The Average defined by the Lebesgue Measure and Integral does not fit all the requirements. If is the Lebesgue Measure of and , then the average of is undefined breaking rules 4 and 5. I wish to define an average that matches all the rules and gives the following. When , the average should be the Lebesgue Average. When is finite the average of should be When is infinite and , divide into equal sub-intervals. Take the average of over the infimum of all sub-intervals that meet . Call this the lower average. Take the average of over the supremum of all sub-intervals that meet . Call this the upper average. As , if the lower and upper average meet at the same value, call this the total average. When the total average is defined it should equal the average I want to define. There are cases of where neither of these averages can give a defined value. Rather we generalize these definitions into my average and see that supports rules 4. and 5. The problem may not be well-defined since an average may be unable to exist on all zero Lebesgue Measure sets. However, before working on my average, I would like to work on my set function which I shall use to compute my average. Note the set function I am defining may not be a measure. It could be finitely additive but give positive values for sets with zero Lebesgue measure. Definition of Outer Set Function If we define the following: are open sub-intervals of is the length of is the length of for then is the outer piece-wise set function defined as Explanation of (Skip if you understand my definition) The parameter must remain a variable throughout the computation of . When is uncountable, should equal , where is the minimum number of that cover for where is uncountable. The reason we set some to lengths zero is that countable subsets of , such as countable , are regarded to be as small as the null set compared to the uncountable set. Hence we ""prevent"" corresponding from covering this part of by setting their ""lengths"" to zero instead of . When is countable should equal where is the minimum number of that can cover . Here can be countable (instead of uncountable). When is countable, we do not set the length of any to be zero, since countable subsets of countable , should be covered by such that the total length of should have a positive proportional value to .

Is it just an simple extension from $L_2$? $L_p$ space has some really nice properties. I think it relies on the definition of this norm, but this definition does not seem to come naturally or maybe I just can't see how it comes naturally. I understand this definition gives a norm. I just want to know the underlying thought of it. Are those nice properties just by chance or does it actually have a relationship with this definition?","Who first defined the norm in $L_p$ space as $$\left(\int{\lvert f(x) \rvert^p}\right)^{1/p}$$ Is there any reference for this?

Suppose I am given a non-measurable set $A$ with the property that there exists no zero measure set which contains all of $A$ . Is it then true that there exists a measurable subset of $A$ with non-null measure? For my specific use case, the underlying space can even be finite-dimensional, in case that makes a difference.

99,Cardinality of Vitali sets: countably or uncountably infinite?,Cardinality of Vitali sets: countably or uncountably infinite?,,"I am a bit confused about the cardinality of the Vitali sets. Just a quick background on what I gather about their construction so far: We divide the real interval $[0,1]$ into an uncountable number of disjoint classes in such a way that two numbers $x$ and $y$ are in the same class if their difference x-y is a rational number. Therefore the equivalence relation on the real numbers would be: $x\sim y\iff x-y\in\mathbb Q$. The cardinality of our classes is equivalent to the cardinality of $\mathbb Q$, so the classes have countably infinite elements. How many of these classes are there? As each only has countably infinite elements, but each element of $[0,1]$ lies in one class, there are uncountably infinite classes. Now, using the axiom of choice, we take one element out of each class and put it in the set V. This is a Vitali set. Hopefully this is all good at this point. So each Vitali set should have uncountably many elements (because we have uncountably many classes), but there should be countably many Vitali sets (because each class has countably many elements) correct? But then why does Wikipedia state that ""There are uncountably many Vitali sets...""?","I am a bit confused about the cardinality of the Vitali sets.
