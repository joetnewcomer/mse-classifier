0,Boundedness of Stability Region of Explicit LMMs,Boundedness of Stability Region of Explicit LMMs,,"I see that for an explicit method such as AB-n or Forward Euler etc. that the region of absolute stability is always within some contour. Is there a reason why this is? I have tried to deduce a conclusion from the stability polynomial but have come up short...I know that, $$\pi_k(z)=\rho(z)-k\lambda\sigma(z)$$ and considering the roots here, then $$k\lambda= \frac{\rho(z)}{\sigma(z)}$$ The method is convergent if $\rho(1)=0$, $\rho^{'}(1)=\sigma(1) \neq 0 $, and if the roots of $\rho$ are less than or equal to 1, with $|z_i|=1$ a simple root. Now if that is true we know $\rho$ has a root of 1. So, $$k\lambda=(z-1)f(z)$$ where $f(z)$ is a rational function with degree of numerator = degree of denominator since the method is explicit. Now, $p(z)$ has lead coefficient 1, so the numerator of $f$ does also, but $\sigma$ may or may not so the denominator of $f$ may or may not. We also know that the value of $z$ is taken such that $|z|=1$ (ie a number from the unit circle). So all factors of the numerator are less than 1 for all $z$. Thus the numerator is less than 1.

After thinking about the question afterwards, here's the best I could do to muster up an answer: Use Rouche's theorem on $|z| = 2$. We get $4$ zeroes within this contour. Furthermore, $f(z)$ has a real root since it's of odd degree. Hence, this root must be of the form $-r$ with $r > 0$. At $r = 3$, we have $f(-3) = 6$ and the function is decreasing as $r$ increases, hence this zero is larger than three. So there are $\boxed{4}$ zeroes in total. Is there an easier, more direct way to get this result? I suspect there is since the other version of the exam had $f(z) = z^4 + 3z^3 + 6$ which is also hard to use Rouche's theorem on and cannot be solved in this manner.",,['complex-analysis']

27,Regarding the weight of the given modular form,Regarding the weight of the given modular form,,"I am following this course. A question regarding the modular form of weight two that is constructed in lecture 33 emerged. Let me briefly tell you what's going on there. Let $\mathbb{H}$ denote the upper half-plane. For $\tau \in \mathbb{H}$, define  $L(\tau)=\{n+m\tau: n,m \in \mathbb{Z}\}$. The Weierstrass $\wp-$function associated to $\tau$ is given by \begin{equation} \wp_{\tau}(z) = \dfrac{1}{z^2}+\sum\limits_{\omega \in L(\tau) \setminus \{(0,0)\}} \bigg(\dfrac{1}{(z-\omega)^2} - \dfrac{1}{\omega^2}\bigg). \end{equation} In what follows, I will omit the subscript $\tau$. It is well known that this function satisfies the differential equation          \begin{equation}  	(\wp'(z))^2=4\wp^3(z)-g_2\wp(z)-g_3,  	\end{equation}     where $g_2=60 \sum\limits_{\omega \in L(\tau) \setminus \{(0,0)\}} \dfrac{1}{\omega^4}$ and $g_3=140 \sum\limits_{\omega \in L(\tau) \setminus \{(0,0)\}} \dfrac{1}{\omega^6}$. We may also write the above equation as \begin{equation}  	(\wp'(z))^2=4(\wp(z)-e_1)(\wp(z)-e_2)(\wp(z)-e_3),  \end{equation} where $e_i=e_i(\tau)$. Note that the values of $z$ at which $\wp'$ vanishes correspond precisely to the values of $z$ for which $\wp(z)=e_i$ for some $i\in\{1,2,3\}$. It can be shown that the only (simple) zeros of $\wp'$ in the parallelogram with vertices $0$, $1$, $\tau$, $1+\tau$ are $\frac{1}{2}$, $\frac{\tau}{2}$, $\frac{1+\tau}{2}$. So we may put  $e_1=\wp(\frac{1}{2})$, $e_2=\wp(\frac{\tau}{2})$, and $e_3=\wp(\frac{1+\tau}{2})$. It can also be shown that all these quantities viz. $e_1,$ $e_2,$ $e_3$ are distinct for any $\tau \in \mathbb{H}$ and that they are holomorphic functions of $\tau$ on the upper half-plane. Now define the function $\lambda: \mathbb{H}\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ by $\lambda(\tau)=\dfrac{e_3(\tau)-e_2(\tau)}{e_1(\tau)-e_2(\tau)}$, which is holomorphic on its domain and never takes the values $0$ and $1$.

Irrational? Here's my thoughts.  The answer is probably some finite number based on $\alpha$ if $\alpha$ is rational and infinitely many if $\alpha$ is irrational.  So I'd like to confirm (or disprove) that guess. First we start with the formula $$(\cos(\alpha \pi) + i\sin(\alpha \pi))^n = \cos(n\alpha \pi) + i\sin(n\alpha \pi)$$ If $\alpha$ is rational, then I can see that some of the powers would be the same.  Let $\alpha = \frac pq$, then we'd get $\cos(n\alpha \pi) + i\sin(n\alpha \pi) = \cos(m\alpha \pi) + i\sin(m\alpha \pi) \iff n\alpha \pi = m\alpha \pi + 2\pi k$.  This implies that $$(n-m)p=2kq$$ So whenever that condition is satisfied, then the $n$th power and $m$th power will be the same.  But I don't see how to count those possibilities. Then if $\alpha$ is irrational, we'd still need $n\alpha \pi = m\alpha \pi + 2\pi k = (m\alpha + 2k)\pi$, but this time $\alpha \ne \frac pq$.  So we'd just get $$\alpha = \frac{2k}{n-m}$$ The right hand side is always rational, so there is no pair $(n,m)$ for which this holds.  So there are infinitely many solutions if $\alpha$ is irrational. So it seems I've gotten the irrational case, but I can't see how to count up the solutions in the rational case.","How many distinct powers of $\cos(\alpha \pi) + i\sin(\alpha \pi)$ are there if $\alpha$ is rational?

53,Schwarz' lemma: Prove that the inequality is strict unless the function f is of a certain form.,Schwarz' lemma: Prove that the inequality is strict unless the function f is of a certain form.,,"the question (not homework) I am trying to answer is, in part: Let $f$ be an analytic function that maps the open unit disk $D$ into   itself and vanishes at the origin.  Prove that the inequality $$|f(z)| + |f(−z)| ≤ 2 |z^2| $$ is strict, except at the origin, unless f has the   form $f(z) = λz^2$ for some $λ$ a constant of absolute value one . I applied Schwarz' lemma to obtain the inequality.  Below is my answer: It is clear that the inequality holds at the origin.  The hypotheses given for $f$ are the same as those required for Schwarz' lemma to apply to $f$; the lemma clearly applies to both $f(z)$ and $f(-z)$.  Thus I have   $$|f(z) + f(-z)| \leq |f(z)| + |f(-z)| \leq |z| + |z| = 2|z|$$   Divide both sides by $|2z|$ (I have assumed $z\neq 0$):   $$\frac{|f(z) + f(-z)|}{|2z|} \leq 1$$   This fact shows that the function $(f(z) + f(-z))/ 2z$ has a removable singularity at $z = 0$ (since it is bounded in a neighbourhood of that point).  Calling the analytic continuation $g(z)$, $g$ is a holomorphic map from $D$ to $D$ and vanishes at the origin; to see why, expand $f(z) + f(-z)$ into the sum of two power series, note that the first two terms vanish, and conclude that $g$ has a zero of order at least one at the origin.  So Schwarz' lemma applies to $g(z)$, and in particular $|g(z)| \leq |z|$.  But this fact directly implies the desired inequality. The problem is that I have come most of the way to proving the strict inequality, but cannot prove that the given form is the only possible form for $f(z)$.  I proved that if $|f(c) + f(-c)| = 2|c^2|$ for some $c$ not the origin, then the constructed function $g(z)$ is a rotation by Schwarz' lemma, which means that $f(z) + f(-z) = \lambda z^2$.  This means that all even-index coefficients of the power series of $f$ must be zero, but it does not rule out the possibility that there are odd-index coefficients.
