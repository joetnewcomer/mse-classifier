It's well known there do NOT exist distance preserving maps between the sphere and the plane. So naturally one can ask if Hausdorff $2$ -measure can be preserved and Hausdorff $1$ -measure isn't preserved then is there some $1 < \theta < 2$ such that Hausdorff $\theta$ -measure can be preserved. My expectation is that either measure preserving maps exist for all $1 < \theta \le 2$ or no measure preserving maps exist for $1 \le \theta < 2$ . Any other behavior would be certainly surprising and or interesting. Some Ideas of Mine: A related question might be to ask for maps from the Sphere to itself which preserve a particular Hausdorff Measure. This question might be a bit more tractable. Suppose you fix the sphere along an axis $A$ . And divide the surface of the sphere up into slices each of which can be independent rotated. So the map of the sphere can be viewed as a map along the axis and at each point of the axis an angle is indicated for how much that particular slice rotates. We can characterize these maps from the sphere to itself by looking at functions from $[-r, r] \rightarrow [\pi, -\pi]$ As long as ALL the slices are rotated the same angle, you get an isometry which preserves $1$ -measure.

I want to believe that (and I don't have a proof of this) for any continuous function with hausdorff measure $\le 2$ the implied map between spheres will preserve area. It would be beautiful but perhaps unsurprising if we stretched this idea in 2 dimensions to say that any continuous function with hausdorff measure $1 < \theta < \tau$ from axis to angle space preserves the Hausdorff $\tau$ measure on the sphere.

16,Is there a topology for nondecreasing continuous functions?,Is there a topology for nondecreasing continuous functions?,,"Let $I=[0,1]$ be the unit interval, with $\tau_0$ the usual topology. Inspired by this question , I've been wondering whether it is possible to topologize $I$ so that the continuous functions are precisely the usual continuous functions that are also nondecreasing.  That is, Is there another topology $\tau$ on $I$ such that $f\colon I\to I$ is $\tau$ -continuous if and only if it is $\tau_0$ -continuous and nondecreasing? (Here by $\tau$ -continuous we mean continuous when both domain and codomain are equipped with $\tau$ .) There are some related topologies in this vein. If we only want to get nondecreasing functions (i.e., $f$ is continuous iff $f$ is nondecreasing), we have the Alexandrov topology given by: $$\tau_a=\{U\in \mathcal P(I)\mid x\in U\wedge y\geq x\implies y\in U\}$$ Similarly, if we let $\tau_-=\{(a,1]\mid 0\leq a<1 \}\cup\{\emptyset\}$ , it is routine to verify $f$ is $\tau_-$ -continuous if and only if $f$ is nondecreasing and $\tau_0$ -continuous from the left. We could similarly get right continuity by defining $\tau_+=\{[0,a)\mid 0<a\leq 1\}\cup\{\emptyset\}$ . However, these kinds of simple constructions don't seem to have an obvious way to modify them to get all nondecreasing continuous functions - trying to combine the open sets in $\tau_+$ and $\tau_-$ gives us back $\tau_0$ , so we lose monotonicity. I'd be very interested in either an example of such a topology $\tau$ or a proof that one cannot exist. More generally, one can replace $I$ with any totally ordered set $T$ with its order topology, and ask the same question.  The topologies $\tau_a$ , $\tau_+$ , and $\tau_-$ defined above all generalize easily, and as a result, it is easy to see that if $T$ is any well-ordered set, or more generally, any total ordered set in which every element has an immediate successor, the answer is yes, since we can just take $\tau_-$ , as every function is already continuous from the right.

I am not sure what the most general correct form of the statement is, and if one can weaken the hypotheses successfully I would appreciate a proof or proof sketch of how to achieve that.

However, we can factor this inclusion as: $$S^{q-1}\hookrightarrow h'(D^q)\hookrightarrow D^{p+q}\setminus h(D^p)$$ Using the fact that $h'$ and $h$ have disjoint image (observe we can get away with $h(D^p)$ being a subset of $h'(D^q)$ which avoids $S^{q-1}$ ). Since the middle term has trivial reduced homology in all degrees we conclude (from this being an isomorphism and $S^{q-1}$ not having trivial reduced homology in all degrees) that something is wrong with our premises and no such $h,h'$ can exist. This crucially relies on $S^{p+q-1}\setminus S^{p-1}\hookrightarrow D^{p+q}\setminus h(D^p)$ inducing an isomorphism on homology, which is horribly false if we relax the assumption $S^{p-1}=h(D^p)\cap S^{p+q-1}=h(S^{p-1})$ to the assumption $h(S^{p-1})=S^{p-1}$ .

22,Is Bing's discrete extension space realcompact?,Is Bing's discrete extension space realcompact?,,"See here for definition of Bing's space. There's also Dan Ma's blog or Counterexamples in Topology by Steen and Sebach. Since the Michael's closed subspace $Y\subseteq X$ of Bing's space $X$ is metacompact but not paracompact, $Y$ is not countably compact. Therefore, $X$ is not countably compact. Since $X$ is normal, it's not pseudocompact. Is $X$ realcompact? The map $f:X\to \{0, 1\}^{2^\mathbb{R}}$ , $f(x) = x$ , is a continuous bijection. If we were to show that every subspace of $\{0, 1\}^{2^\mathbb{R}}$ is realcompact, then this would imply that $X$ is realcompact. Edit: We know that $Y$ is realcompact from other results (it's a $T_4$ metacompact space of non-measurable size). If we could show that $X$ is subparacompact, or more generally $\theta$ -refinable, then it would follow that $X$ is realcompact. This would hold if we could show that $X$ has a $\sigma$ -locally finite network, for then it'd be a $\sigma$ -space, hence subparacompact (Bing's space H is subparacompact for this reason). Edit 2: Note that the Bing's space H was specifically constructed so all the points in it are $G_\delta$ . This means we probably can't show that Bing's space G has such network after all, since all non-isolated points are not $G_\delta$ . Edit 3: In the literature, $\theta$ -refinable spaces are called submetacompact spaces. Here $X$ is a space which isn't collectionwise normal, so it's possible that it's submetacompact. Edit 4: Another author shows that if in the construction of Bing's space G, the set we use instead of $\mathbb{R}$ is of size $>$ continuum, then space such obtained won't be submetacompact, using some results by Erdos. This doesn't mean above example isn't submetacompact, since we are interested in construction based on taking $\mathbb{R}$ , a set of precisely size continuum. Edit 5: While I'm not certain if the Bing's space constructed from $\mathbb{R}$ is $\theta$ -refinable (or submetacompact), it's weakly $\theta$ -refinable and shrinking. In particular it's countably paracompact. Edit 6: I've missed this before, but $\{0, 1\}^{2^\mathbb{R}}$ is not hereditarily realcompact since $\omega_1$ embedds into it, and $\omega_1$ is not realcompact.

There's also Dan Ma's blog or Counterexamples in Topology by Steen and Sebach. Since the Michael's closed subspace of Bing's space is metacompact but not paracompact, is not countably compact. Therefore, is not countably compact. Since is normal, it's not pseudocompact. Is realcompact? The map , , is a continuous bijection. If we were to show that every subspace of is realcompact, then this would imply that is realcompact. Edit: We know that is realcompact from other results (it's a metacompact space of non-measurable size). If we could show that is subparacompact, or more generally -refinable, then it would follow that is realcompact. This would hold if we could show that has a -locally finite network, for then it'd be a -space, hence subparacompact (Bing's space H is subparacompact for this reason). Edit 2: Note that the Bing's space H was specifically constructed so all the points in it are . This means we probably can't show that Bing's space G has such network after all, since all non-isolated points are not . Edit 3: In the literature, -refinable spaces are called submetacompact spaces. Here is a space which isn't collectionwise normal, so it's possible that it's submetacompact. Edit 4: Another author shows that if in the construction of Bing's space G, the set we use instead of is of size continuum, then space such obtained won't be submetacompact, using some results by Erdos. This doesn't mean above example isn't submetacompact, since we are interested in construction based on taking , a set of precisely size continuum. Edit 5: While I'm not certain if the Bing's space constructed from is -refinable (or submetacompact), it's weakly -refinable and shrinking. In particular it's countably paracompact. Edit 6: I've missed this before, but is not hereditarily realcompact since embedds into it, and is not realcompact. It's not Borel-complete either since is not Borel-complete. Since is normal and countably paracompact, if is Borel-complete then is realcompact. Since is not countably compact, is not Borel-complete.

One of the question is showing that some set is open and closed. I would like to know if my answer is correct, and if so if there's any better way to do it (my proof feels a bit overcomplicated to me). For $U\subseteq E$ open and connected, $a\in U$ and $\epsilon > 0$ they define $U^*$ as the set of $x\in U$ such that there exists connected open sets $V_0,..,V_n$ satisfying: $a\in V_0$ and $x\in V_n$ $\overline V_i \subset U$ and $\text{diam}(V_i) < \epsilon$ for $i=0,1,2,...,n$ $V_{i-1} \cap V_i \neq \emptyset$ for $i=1,2,...,n$ Show that $U^*$ is open and closed (openness) For $x \in U^*$ we have the associated sequence $V_0,..,V_n$ with $x\in V_n$ and $V_n$ open so $\exists r>0$ such that $B(x,r) \subset V_n$ and naturally any $y\in B(x,r)$ is an element of $U^*$ . Hence $U^*$ is open. (closedness) We show that the closure of $U^*$ is a subset of $U^*$ . Let $x\in \overline U^*$ , $E$ a metric space so there's a sequence $(x_n)$ of elements of $U^*$ that converges towards $x$ . $E$ is locally connected so there is $V$ a connected neighborhood of $x$ and by convergence $\exists n\in\mathbb{N}$ s.t. $x_n \in V$ . We have $x_n \in U^*$ so there exists sets $V_0,..,V_n$ satisfying the three conditions. Note that $V\cap (E\setminus\overline V_n)$ and $V\cap V_n$ form a disjoint open cover of $V$ . Since $V$ is connected and $V \cap V_n$ isn't empty because $x_n \in V \cap V_n$ we have that $V\cap (E\setminus\overline V_n) = \emptyset$ hence necessarily $x\in\overline V_n$ Therefore, \begin{gather} x\in\overline V_n \subset U \end{gather} Now we wish to construct a connected open set $V'$ such that $V_0,..,V_{n-1},V'$ has the three desired properties so we can conclude that $x\in U^*$ . $U$ is open so there exists $0<r<\epsilon - \text{diam}(V_n)$ such that $B(x,r)\subset U$ . Now since $E$ is a metric space it is regular so there is a neighborhood $\Gamma$ of $x$ such that $x\in \overline \Gamma \subset B(x,r)$ . Finally since $E$ is locally connected there is an open connected neighborhood $C\subset\Gamma$ of $x$ such that \begin{gather} x\in C\subset\overline\Gamma\subset B(x,r) \end{gather} Now consider \begin{gather} V' = C \cup V_n \end{gather} It's open since it's the union of two open sets. Note that $V_n$ and $C$ are both connected and $C\cap V_n \neq \emptyset$ since $C$ is a neighborhood of $x\in\overline V_n$ . Hence $V'$ is connected. Concerning the three conditions, $x\in V'$ since $x\in C$ $\overline V' = \overline C \cup \overline V_n$ and $\overline C \subset \overline \Gamma \subset U$ since $\overline V_n \subset U$ we have $\overline V' \subset U$ . The condition on the radius of the ball implies that $\text{diam}(C) < \epsilon - \text{diam}(V_n)$ so we easily get $\text{diam}(V') < \epsilon$ by triangular inequality. And obviously $V' \cap V_{n-1} \neq \emptyset$ . Therefore $V_0,...,V_{n-1},V'$ respect all the desired properties and thus $x\in U^*$ .

Clarification,,"The question Topologizing free abelian groups on Mathoverflow asks about the existence and uniqueness of a topology for the free abelian group on $X$ such that the natural inclusion is a homeomorphism onto its image and addition and inverse map are continuous.

Then every continuous $\varphi : [0,\Omega)\rightarrow E^{1}$ must be constant in a tail of $[\beta,\Omega)$ . My attempt It must be proved that the function $\varphi$ is constant from a certain value of the subspace $[0,\Omega)$ , i.e., for all $n\in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$ there exists a $\alpha_n < \Omega$ for all $\xi> \alpha_n:|\varphi(\xi)-\varphi(\alpha_n)|< \frac{1}{n}$ (*). Suppose this were not true, then there exists a $n_0$ for every $\alpha<\Omega$ there exists a $\xi>\alpha$ such that $|\varphi(\xi)-\varphi(\alpha)|< \frac{1}{n_0}$ . Since each element of $[0, \Omega)$ has an immediate predecessor then, we can use induction to construct a countable succession, that is $\{\xi_i: i\in \mathbb{Z}^{+}\}$ such that. $$\xi_i<\xi_{i+1}$$ and $$|\varphi(\xi_i)-\varphi(\xi_{i+1})| \geq \frac{1}{n_0}$$ for each $i$ , choosing $\xi_1=0$ and assuming that $\xi_1, \xi_2,...,\xi_k$ are defined, since $\xi_k$ has a successor, then $\xi_{k+1}$ is the first element in $[\xi_k, \Omega)$ that satisfies the hypothesis. The succession $\{\xi_i\}$ thus constructed,  would have a minimum upper bound $\gamma<\Omega$ and then $\varphi$ would not be continuous in $\gamma$ , since any neighborhood $(\eta, \gamma]$ contains some $\xi_i$ and therefore any $\xi_k$ , $k>i$ cannot have an image contained in the $$\left( \varphi(\gamma)-\frac{1}{3n_0}, \varphi(\gamma)+\frac{1}{3n_0}\right)$$ neighborhood of $\varphi(\gamma)$ . Since this contradicts the definition of continuity, let's see. Let $(\eta,\gamma]$ be an open containing $\gamma$ . This open contains infinitely many $k_i$ , for $k>i$ we have $$|\varphi(\xi_k)-\varphi(\gamma)|$$ but $$|\varphi(\xi_k)-\varphi(\xi_{k+1})+\varphi(\xi_{k+1})-\varphi(\gamma)|=|\varphi(\xi_k)- \varphi(\gamma)|\leq \frac{1}{3n_0}$$ luego $$|\varphi(\xi_k)-\varphi(\xi_{k+1})|-|\varphi(\xi_{k+1})-\varphi(\gamma)|\leq \frac{1}{3n_0}$$ $$\frac{1}{n_0}-|\varphi(\xi_{k+1})-\varphi(\gamma)|\leq \frac{1}{3n_0}$$ from where $$\frac{1}{n_0}\leq \frac{1}{3n_0}+\frac{1}{3n_0}$$ with which we have that $1\leq \frac{2}{3}$ , this is a contradiction, therefore it is satisfied that for all $n\in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$ there exists a $\alpha_n < \Omega$ for all $\xi> \alpha_n: |\varphi(\xi)-\varphi(\alpha_n)|< \frac{1}{n}$ . Now, let $\beta$ be an upper bound of $\alpha_n$ ;then $\beta <\Omega$ and $\varphi$ is constant in $[\beta,\Omega)$ : We must prove that if $\beta \in [\beta,\Omega)$ , then the images are equal, otherwise we have that $$|\varphi(\zeta)-\varphi(\alpha_{n})|<\frac{1}{n}$$ and $$|\varphi(\beta)-\varphi(\alpha_n)|<\frac{1}{n}$$ for all $n$ , thus. \begin{equation*}      \begin{split} |\varphi(\zeta)-\varphi(\beta)|=&|\varphi(\zeta)-\varphi(\alpha_n)+\varphi(\alpha_n)-\varphi(\beta)|\\ \leq & |\varphi(\zeta)-\varphi(\alpha_n)|+|\varphi(\alpha_n)-\varphi(\beta)|\\ \leq & \frac{1}{n}+\frac{1}{n}\\ =&\frac{2}{n}      \end{split}  \end{equation*} for all n.

42,Attempt to prove that every orientable connected manifold has exactly two orientations (Munkres),Attempt to prove that every orientable connected manifold has exactly two orientations (Munkres),,"I am looking at Munkres' book Analysis on Manifolds and come across the following exercise: Show that if M is a connected orientable $k$ -manifold in $\mathbb R^n$ , then M has precisely two orientations Here is my attempt (following the hint from the book): Choose an orientation of $M$ ; it consists of a collection of coordinate patches $\{\alpha_i\}$ . Let $\{\beta_j\}$ be an arbitrary (fixed) orientation of $M$ . Given $\mathbf x \in M$ , choose coordinate patches $\alpha_i$ and $\beta_j$ about $\mathbf x$ and define $\lambda(\mathbf x)=1$ if they overlap positively at $\mathbf x$ , and $\lambda(\mathbf x)=-1$ if they overlap negatively at $\mathbf x$ . First we note that $\lambda$ is well defined. Choose any two pairs of patches, say $\alpha_1,\beta_1$ and $\alpha_2,\beta_2$ , with $$ \alpha_1(t_1)=\beta_1(s_1)=\mathbf x=\alpha_2(t_2)=\beta_2(s_2). $$ Suppose $\alpha_1,\beta_1$ overlap positively at $\mathbf x$ , then $$ \alpha_2^{-1}\circ\beta_2=\left(\alpha_2^{-1}\circ\alpha_1\right)\circ\left(\alpha_1^{-1}\circ\beta_1\right)\circ\left(\beta_1^{-1}\circ\beta_2\right). $$ at some neighrborhood around $\mathbf x$ . It follows that $\alpha_2,\beta_2$ overlap positively iff $\alpha_1,\beta_1$ do. Now, suppose $\alpha:U\to V$ and $\beta:O\to P$ overlap positively at $\mathbf x$ , say with $\alpha(t_0)=\beta(s_0)=\mathbf x$ . Since $V\cap P$ is an open subset of $M$ containing $\mathbf x$ , take a connected open neighborhood $W$ of $s_0$ so that $\beta(W)\subset V\cap P$ . Since $\beta^{-1}$ is continuous, $\beta(W)$ is an open neighborhood of $\mathbf x$ . Consider the function $f:W\to\mathbb R$ defined by $f(s)=\det(D(\alpha^{-1}\beta)(s))$ , then $f(s_0)>0$ by assumption. Moreover, $f\ne0$ on $W$ since transition functions have nonsingular derivative. Since $W$ is connected, $f$ does not change sign on $W$ , so $\alpha$ and $\beta$ overlap positively on $W$ . An entirely similar argument holds for the case where $\alpha$ , $\beta$ overlap negatively at $\mathbf x$ . Hence, $\lambda$ is continuous. Thus, since $M$ is connected, $\lambda$ is either identically $1$ or identically $-1$ . If $\lambda$ is identically $1$ , then every patch in $\{\beta_j\}$ overlaps positively with patches in $\{\alpha_i\}$ , whence $\{\beta_j\}\subset\{\alpha_i\}\subset\{\beta_j\}$ by the definition of orientation. The other case is similar. Hence, $\{\beta_j\}$ is either the same as $\{\alpha_i\}$ or the opposite orientation to $\{\alpha_i\}$ . Can anybody tell me if my proof is correct? I have seen some similar questions on stackexchange, but they seem to assume different backgrounds and do not apply to the book I'm reading now. Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance! Edit: If two patches $\alpha,\beta$ ""overlap positively,"" the book means the transition function $\alpha^{-1}\circ\beta$ is orientation-preserving, i.e. its derivative has positive determinant everywhere on the domain ( $\det(D(\alpha^{-1}\circ\beta)(x))>0$ ).","I am looking at Munkres' book Analysis on Manifolds and come across the following exercise: Show that if M is a connected orientable -manifold in , then M has precisely two orientations Here is my attempt (following the hint from the book): Choose an orientation of ; it consists of a collection of coordinate patches .

47,Are there any concrete examples of Baire spaces $X$ in which neither player has a winning strategy in BM(X),Are there any concrete examples of Baire spaces  in which neither player has a winning strategy in BM(X),X,"Let $X$ be a topological space. A Banach-Mazur game $BM(X)$ is played by two players $\alpha$ and $\beta$ , who select nonempty open subsets of $X$ . The player $\beta$ starts a game by selecting a nonempty open subset $V_1$ of $X$ . In return, $\alpha$ -player chooses a nonempty open subset $W_1$ of $V_1$ . In general, at the $n$ -th stage of the game, $n \geq 1$ , the player $\beta$ chooses a nonempty open subset $V_n ⊂ W_{n−1}$ and $\alpha$ answers by a nonempty open subset $W_n$ of $V_n$ . Proceeding in this fashion, the players generate a sequence $(V_n,W_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ which is called a play. The player $\alpha$ is said to be the winner of the play $(V_n,W_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ if $\bigcap_{n\geq 1}V_n =\bigcap_{n\geq 1}W_n\neq \emptyset$ otherwise the player $\beta$ wins this play. A partial play is a finite sequence of sets consisting of the first few moves of a play. A strategy for player $\alpha$ is a rule by means of which the player makes his/her choices. Here is a more formal definition of the notion strategy. A strategy s for the player $\alpha$ is a sequence of mappings $s = \{ s_n\}$ , which is inductively defined as follows: The domain of $s_1$ is the set of all open subsets of $X$ and $s_1$ assigns to each nonempty open set $V_1 \subset X$ , a nonempty open subset $W_1 = s_1(V_1)$ of $V_1$ .

An $s$ -play is a play in which $\alpha$ selects his/her moves according to the strategy $s$ .

Fix $\varepsilon>0$ and $\delta := \varepsilon/4$ . Let $(D^+, D^-)$ be the Hahn decomposition $X$ w.r.t. $\mu$ , i.e., $\mu$ is positive on $D^+$ and negative on $D^-$ . Let $A^\pm:=\Theta\cap D^\pm$ . Since $|\mu|$ is inner regular, there are closed subsets $C^\pm$ of $X$ such that $C^\pm \subset A^\pm$ and $|\mu|(A^\pm \setminus C^\pm) < \delta$ . Since $X$ is normal, there are open subsets $O^\pm$ of $X$ such that $C^\pm \subset O^\pm$ and $O^+ \cap O^- = \emptyset$ . WLOG, we assume $O^\pm \subset \Theta$ . By Urysohn's lemma, there is $f^\pm:X \to [0, 1]$ continuous such that $f^\pm (C^\pm) =1$ and $f^\pm (X \setminus O^\pm) =0$ . Notice that $f^\pm$ is supported on $O^\pm$ , so $f^+ f^- =0$ . Let $f:=f^+-f^-$ . Then $f$ is continuous and $|f| \le 1$ . Hence $|f| \in \mathcal C_b(X)$ . It follows from $O^\pm \subset \Theta$ that $|f| \le 1_\Theta$ . Let's prove that $$ \int_X f \mathrm d \mu \ge |\mu|(\Theta) - \varepsilon. $$ We have $$ \begin{aligned}     |\mu|(O^-\setminus C^-) &\le |\mu|((\Theta\setminus O^+)\setminus C^-) \\      &= |\mu|(\Theta)-|\mu|(O^+)-|\mu|(C^-) \\      &\le |\mu|(\Theta)-|\mu|(C^+)-|\mu|(C^-) \\      &<|\mu|(\Theta)-|\mu|(A^+)-|\mu|(A^-)+2\delta \\     &= 2\delta.   \end{aligned} $$ Then $$ \begin{aligned}     \int_X f\mathrm d\mu&=\int_{O^+} f^+\mathrm d\mu-\int_{O^-} f^-\mathrm d\mu \\      &\ge\int_{C^+} f^+\mathrm d\mu-\int_{C^-} f^-\mathrm d\mu -\int_{O^-\setminus C^-} f^-\mathrm d\mu \\      &\ge \mu(C^+)-\mu(C^-) -\int_{O^-\setminus C^-} f^-\mathrm d\mu \\      &\ge\mu(C^+)-\mu(C^-) -|\mu|(O^-\setminus C^-) \\      &>\mu(A^+)-\delta-\mu(A^-)-\delta -2\delta \\      &=|\mu|(\Theta)-4\delta=|\mu|(X)-\varepsilon. \end{aligned} $$ Finally, $$ \begin{align} \int_X f \mathrm d \mu = \lim_n \int_X f \mathrm d \mu_n \le \liminf_n \int_X |f| \mathrm d |\mu_n| \le \liminf_n \int_X 1_{\Theta} \mathrm d |\mu_n| \le \liminf_n |\mu_n|(\Theta). \end{align} $$ This completes the proof.

Let $X$ be a non-empty set and $⊲$ a relation on subsets of $X$ such that $∅ ⊲ ∅$ and $X ⊲ X$ $A ⊆ A'$ , $A' ⊲ B'$ , $B' ⊆ B$ imply $A ⊲ B$ . $A ⊲ B$ implies $A ⊆ B$ . $A ⊲ B$ and $A' ⊲ B'$ imply $A ∩ A' ⊲ B ∩ B'$ . $A_i ⊲ B_i$ for all $i ∈ I$ implies $⋃_{i ∈ I} A_i ⊲ ⋃_{i ∈ I} B_i$ . For each $x ∈ X$ , $A ⊆ X$ define $A$ to be a neighbourhood of $x$ if $\{ x \} ⊲ A$ . Prove that these neighbourhoods define a topology on $X$ for which $A ⊲ B$ if and only if $A ⊆ \operatorname{Int}(B)$ . By a topology the book means a neighbourhood topology in the following sense: Let $X$ be a set and let $\mathcal{N}$ be a function assigning to each $x$ in $X$ a set $\mathcal{N}(x)$ of subsets of $X$ . The elements of $\mathcal{N}(x)$ will be called neighbourhoods of $x$ . The function $\mathcal{N}$ is a neighbourhood topology if it satisfies the following axioms for each $x$ in $X$ : The set $\mathcal{N}(x)$ is non-empty. If $N$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ , then $x ∈ N$ . If $N$ is a subset of $X$ containing a neighbourhood of $x$ , then $N$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ . The intersection of any two neighbourhoods of $x$ is again a neighbourhood of $x$ . Any neighbourhood $N$ of $x$ contains a neighbourhood $M$ of $x$ such that $N$ is a neighbourhood of each point of $M$ . My attempts so far: It is not hard to see that properties 0–3 of a neighbourhood topology are satisfied, but I’m struggling to show property 4. Given a neighbourhood $N$ of $x$ we can consider the set $$   M   =   \{     y ∈ N   \mid     \{ y \} ⊲ N   \} $$ and this should a posteriori do the job.

67,The Mapping Class Group of the Annulus,The Mapping Class Group of the Annulus,,"I was reading ""A primer on Mapping Class Groups"" by B. Farb and D. Margalit and I'm stuck at a point in the proof of Mod $(A)\cong \mathbb{Z}$ where $A$ is the annulus. Proposition 2.4 $\operatorname{Mod}(A) \approx \mathbb{Z}$ . Proof. First we construct a $\operatorname{map} \rho: \operatorname{Mod}(A) \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ . Let $f \in \operatorname{Mod}(A)$ and let $\phi: A \rightarrow A$ be any homeomorphism representing $f$ . The universal cover of $A$ is the infinite strip $\widetilde{A} \approx \mathbb{R} \times[0,1]$ , and $\phi$ has a preferred lift $\widetilde{\phi}: \widetilde{A} \rightarrow \widetilde{A}$ fixing the origin. Let $\widetilde{\phi}_{1}: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ denote the restriction of $\widetilde{\phi}$ to $\mathbb{R} \times\{1\}$ , which is canonically identified with $\mathbb{R}$ . Since $\widetilde{\phi}_{1}$ is a lift to $\mathbb{R}$ of the identity map on one of the boundary components of $A$ , it is an integer translation. We define $\rho(f)$ to be $\widetilde{\phi}_{1}(0)$ . If we identify $\mathbb{Z}$ with the group of integer translations of $\mathbb{R}$ , then the map $\widetilde{\phi}_{1}$ itself is an element of $\mathbb{Z}$ , and we can write $\rho(f)=\widetilde{\phi}_{1} \in \mathbb{Z}$ . From this point of view, it is clear that $\rho$ is a homomorphism since compositions of maps of $A$ are sent to compositions of translations of $\mathbb{R}$ . We can give an equivalent definition of $\rho$ as follows. Let $\delta$ be an oriented simple proper arc that connects the two boundary components of $A$ . Given $f$ and $\phi$ as above, the concatenation $\phi(\delta) * \delta^{-1}$ is a loop based at $\delta(0)$ , and $\rho(f)$ equals $\left[\phi(\delta) * \delta^{-1}\right] \in \pi_{1}(A, \delta(0)) \approx \mathbb{Z}$ . Yet another equivalent way to define $\rho$ is to let $\widetilde{\delta}$ be the unique lift of $\delta$ to $\widetilde{A}$ based at the origin and to set $\rho(f)$ to be the endpoint of $\widetilde{\phi}(\widetilde{\delta})$ in $\mathbb{R} \times\{1\} \approx \mathbb{R}$ . We now show that $\rho$ is surjective. The linear transformation of $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ given by the matrix $$ M=\left(\begin{array}{ll} 1 & n \\ 0 & 1 \end{array}\right) $$ preserves $\mathbb{R} \times[0,1]$ and is equivariant with respect to the group of deck transformations. Thus the restriction of the linear map $M$ to $\mathbb{R} \times[0,1]$ descends to a homeomorphism $\phi$ of $A$ . The action of this homeomorphism on $\delta$ is depicted in Figure $2.5$ for the case $n=-1$ . It follows from the definition of $\rho$ that $\rho([\phi])=n$ . why $\rho$ is surjective ? why $\phi$ is homeomorphism ?  what is exactly homeomorphism $\phi$ of $A$ such that $\rho([\phi])=n$ ? why $\rho([\phi])=n$ ? also what is definition of preferred lift ? i think we have $T_{M}:\mathbb R\times [0,1]\to \mathbb R\times [0,1]$ (or  linear transformation of $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ given by the matrix $M$ ) is the covering map. If $x\in A$ , you can pick a $y\in T_{M}^{-1}(x)$ . Thanks to the equivariance property, $\phi(x) = T_{M}(My)=M^2y$ does not depend on the choice of $y$ .

68,Equivalence of Definitions of Hirsch and Wall of Strong $C^r$-topologies,Equivalence of Definitions of Hirsch and Wall of Strong -topologies,C^r,"I've been reading about strong (and weak) $C^r$ -topologies on the space of $C^r$ -maps between $C^s$ -manifolds $M$ and $N$ ( $s \ge r$ ) from the textbooks of Hirsch and Wall (both called Differential Topology), and I noticed that they use different definitions for the strong and weak $C^r$ -topology. Hirsch's definition: take a $C^r$ -function $f: M \to N$ , locally finite set of charts $\Phi = \{(U_i, \varphi_i)\}_i$ on $M$ , a set of charts $\Psi = \{(V_i,\psi_i)\}_i$ on $N$ , a family of compact sets $K = \{K_i\}_i$ with $K_i \subseteq U_i$ , and a family of positive real numbers $\varepsilon = \{\varepsilon_i\}_i.$ Then a basic neighborhood of Hirsch's strong topology is \begin{multline} \mathcal{N}^r(f; \Phi, \Psi, K, \varepsilon) = \{g \in C^r(M,N) \textrm{ }| \textrm{ } (\forall i) \textrm{ }g(K_i) \subset V_i, \textrm{ } (\forall i, x \in \varphi_i(K_i), k = 0,\dots,r) \textrm{ } \\ ||D^k(\psi_i f \varphi_i^{-1})(x) - D^k(\psi_i g \varphi_i^{-1}(x)|| < \varepsilon_i\}. \end{multline} Wall's definition: Wall's definition is simpler - for an open set $W \subseteq M \times J^r(M,N)$ , a basis set is given by $$B(W) := \{f \in C^r(M,N) \textrm{ } | \textrm{ } \Gamma(j^rf) \subseteq W\}.$$ $\Gamma$ denotes the graph of a function. It is the minimal topology such that the injective map $j^r: C^r(M,N) \to C^0_F(M, J^r(M,N))$ is a topological embedding, where $C^0_F(M,J^r(M,N))$ denotes the fine topology . In general, given topological spaces $X$ and $Y$ , the fine topology is the one generated by the basis $B(W) = \{f \in C(X,Y) \textrm{ } | \textrm{ } \Gamma(f) \subseteq W\}$ , where $W \subset X \times Y$ is an open set. QUESTION: How would one prove that these two definitions are equivalent, i.e. generate the same topology? I was able to prove equivalence for their definitions of weak topology, as well as one direction for the strong one - namely, that Hirsch's topology is no finer than Wall's. However, I'm having a hard time with the other direction - it just seems too complicated to construct all of the necessary data - the $\Phi$ , $\Psi$ , $K$ and $\varepsilon$ ... I provide what I've done below. Hirsch $\subseteq$ Wall: By Lemma A.4.1 of Wall's book, if $X,Y$ are metric spaces, then the sets $$I(\{K_\alpha, U_\alpha\}) = \{f \in C(X,Y) \textrm{ } | \textrm{ } (\forall \alpha) \textrm{ } f(K_\alpha) \subseteq U_\alpha\},$$ where $K_\alpha$ are compact and $U_\alpha$ open, and $\{K_\alpha\}$ is a locally finite collection, form a subbase for the fine topology on $C^0(X,Y).$ Now if I'm given a set $\mathcal{N}^r(f; \Phi, \Psi, K, \varepsilon)$ , then it's equal to $(j^r)^{-1}(I(\{K_i,W_i\})$ where $W_i \subseteq J^r(U_i,V_i)$ is the inverse image by the jet chart of the set \begin{multline} W_i' := \{(\varphi_i(x),\psi_i g (x), D(\psi_i g \varphi_i^{-1})(x),\dots,D^r(\psi_i g \varphi_i^{-1})(x)) | x \in U_i, \forall k = 0, \dots, r : ||D^k(\psi_i g \varphi_i^{-1})(x) - D^k(\psi_i f \varphi_i^{-1})(x)|| < \varepsilon_i\} \end{multline} and therefore it's open in ""Wall's strong topology."" As for the other direction , I look at some $f \in (j^r)^{-1}(I(\{K_\alpha, W_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in A}))$ - for every individual pair $(K_\alpha, W_\alpha)$ , I can find a set $\mathcal{N}^r(f; \Phi_\alpha, \Psi_\alpha, K'_\alpha, \varepsilon_\alpha)$ where the collections $\Phi_\alpha, \Psi_\alpha, K'_\alpha, \varepsilon_\alpha$ are finite such that $$f \in \mathcal{N}^r(f; \Phi_\alpha, \Psi_\alpha, K'_\alpha, \varepsilon_\alpha) \subseteq (j^r)^{-1}(I(\{K_\alpha,W_\alpha\})).$$ Therefore, a possible solution would be to take the intersection for all $\alpha \in A$ to get $$\mathcal{N}^r(f; \cup_{\alpha \in A} \Phi_\alpha, \cup_{\alpha \in A} \Psi_\alpha, \cup_{\alpha \in A} K'_\alpha, \cup_{\alpha \in A} \varepsilon_\alpha).$$ However, I don't know if $\cup_{\alpha \in A} U_\alpha$ will be locally finite . Of course, I can take a locally finite refinement, but I don't know what I'd do with the other data - $\Psi$ , $K'$ , $\epsilon$ . PS: I am willing to provide more details in an edit or in private - also, it's possible that most of what I wrote is useless, so feel free to write a solution that doesn't rely on my ramblings. However, I'd like it to be as self-contained as possible, because many general-topological facts in Hirsch and Wall go unproven.","I've been reading about strong (and weak) -topologies on the space of -maps between -manifolds and ( ) from the textbooks of Hirsch and Wall (both called Differential Topology), and I noticed that they use different definitions for the strong and weak -topology.

(For reminder, the definition, lemma, or any theorem used in the proof will be the ones mentioned in the Munkres.) The way I tried to prove it is as follows: proof. Use Lemma 13.2 in Munkres. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be the collection of all sets of the form $\prod_{\alpha \in J} B_{\alpha}$ (mentioned in the Theorem 19.2. ). Then $\mathcal{C}$ is collection of open sets of the box topology since each $B_{\alpha}$ is open in $X_{\alpha}$ .

( $\because \: U_{\alpha}$ is open in $X_{\alpha}$ and $B_{\alpha}$ is a basis element of $X_{\alpha}$ . Thus by property of basis, the inclusion holds.) Since this can be done for all coordinates of $x$ , we can say that $x$ is contained in some set $B$ which is an element of the $\prod_{\alpha \in J} B_{\alpha}$ mentioned in the Theorem 19.2 and $B$ is contained in the open set $U$ ( $x\in B \subset U)$ .
