This question was posed by a friend of mine, and the Wikipedia pages and existing MO threads are too dense for me to understand. Some SE threads we've looked at include this , this , and this - I feel none of these really answer the essence behind our question (the last one comes close but only briefly touches on the question here).

What we are wondering is why this result is helpful - we have tried to explain the build up to that below. Classical PDE  systems assume that the defining equations are smooth, but it turns out that this is a really strong condition to enforce (for example, take a square wave in the wave equation).

In particular, the subspaces that these solutions live in are called Sobolev spaces, which are themselves Hilbert spaces. It turns out that for some values of $p$ , the Sobolev spaces are also separable, and so all the results from functional analysis can be applied to show existence and uniqueness of solutions to these linear PDEs. Additionally, it turns out that the same thing works for non-integral $p$ (Bessel spaces) which are also Hilbert space when $p = 2$ .

For a counterexample pick a Banach space $(Z, \Vert \cdot \Vert_Z)$ , a discontinuous linear map $C: (Z, \Vert \cdot \Vert_Z)\rightarrow (Z, \Vert \cdot \Vert_Z)$ . We define $X:=Z\oplus Z$ with the norm $\Vert (z_1, z_2)\Vert := \Vert z_1\Vert_Z +\Vert z_2\Vert_Z$ . Then define two discontinuous linear maps $$A: (X, \Vert \cdot \Vert) \rightarrow (X, \Vert \cdot \Vert), A(z_1, z_2):= C(z_1)+z_2$$ and $$ B: (X, \Vert \cdot \Vert) \rightarrow (X, \Vert \cdot \Vert), B(z_1, z_2):=z_1+ C(z_2). $$ Then we define two new norms on $X$ . Namely, we define for $x\in X$ $$ \Vert x\Vert_A := \Vert x\Vert + \Vert Ax\Vert$$ and $$ \Vert x\Vert_B := \Vert x \Vert + \Vert Bx\Vert.$$ Now pick $$(X_0, \Vert \cdot \Vert_{X_0})= (X, \Vert \cdot \Vert_A ) = (Y_0, \Vert \cdot \Vert_{Y_0})$$ and $$ (X_1, \Vert \cdot \Vert_{X_1}) = (X, \Vert \cdot \Vert_B)$$ and $$ (X, \Vert \cdot\Vert) = (Y_1, \Vert \cdot \Vert).$$ We have $$ \Vert i_0 x\Vert_{Y_0} = \Vert x\Vert_{Y_0} =\Vert x\Vert_A = \Vert x\Vert_{X_0}$$ and $$ \Vert i_1 x\Vert_{Y_1} = \Vert x\Vert \leq \Vert x\Vert + \Vert Bx\Vert = \Vert x\Vert_{X_1}$$ Thus, $i_0$ and $i_1$ are continuous. Furthermore, we set $$ T: (Y_0, \Vert \cdot\Vert_{Y_0}) \rightarrow (Y_1, \Vert \cdot \Vert_{Y_1}), x\mapsto Ax.$$ We compute $$\Vert T x\Vert_{Y_1} = \Vert Ax \Vert \leq \Vert x\Vert_{Y_0}$$ Hence, also $T\in L(Y_0, Y_1)$ .

If $S$ was continuous, then also the map $F = S\circ i: (Z, \Vert \cdot \Vert_Z) \rightarrow (X_1, \Vert \cdot\Vert), z \mapsto A(0, z)$ was continuous. This would imply $$ \Vert z \Vert_Z + \Vert C(z) \Vert_Z  = \Vert (0,z) \Vert +  \Vert B(0,z) \Vert = \Vert (0,z) \Vert_{X_1} = \Vert A(0,z)\Vert = \Vert F(z) \Vert \leq \Vert F \Vert_{op} \Vert z \Vert_Z $$ which tells us that $C$ is continuous, which is a contradiction.","Today the following question came up ( A map between Banach spaces is continuous ): I'm trying to prove this statement: Let and be Banach spaces and and normed spaces so that is a vector subspace of and is a vector subspace of .

That is, prove/disprove that for all $\epsilon>0$ there is a $\delta>0$ such that $$|x-t|<\delta, n\in\Bbb N\Rightarrow |f_n(x)-f_n(t)|<\epsilon.$$ Thoughts/Context. It is my gut feeling that $f_n$ are uniformly equicontinuous. I have a not-very-rigorous ""proof"" of this. For $n\in\Bbb N$ and $x\in\Bbb R$ , $\sin^2(n^n x)$ is between $0$ and $1$ , so $$0\le \frac{\sin^2(n^nx)}{\sqrt{n+2}}\le \frac{1}{\sqrt{n+2}}<1.$$ Then from the squeeze theorem $a_n(x)=\frac{\sin^2(n^nx)}{\sqrt{n+2}}\to 0$ as $n\to\infty$ , regardless of the value of $x$ . Hence $\ln(1+a_n(x))\to0$ as $n\to \infty$ as well. So for large $n$ , $f_n$ is practically $\cos(x+n)$ . I know that the set of functions $$\mathcal{E}=\left\{f\in C^1(\Bbb R,\Bbb R): |f'(x)|\le1\right\}$$ is uniformly equicontinuous. Thus the subset $$\{\cos(x+n):n\in\Bbb N\}\subset \mathcal{E}$$ is also uniformly equicontinuous. Of course this does not necessarily imply that functions that behave like $\cos(x+n)$ (in the aforementioned way that $f_n$ does) are also uniformly equicontinuous. Unfortunately, $\{f_n(x):n\in\Bbb N\}$ does not seem to be a subset of $\mathcal{E}$ , so I can't really take the easy way out here.

Thank you. Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a Hilbert space, and suppose that $T\in\text{Hom}(\mathcal{H},\mathcal{H})$ . Suppose that there exists an operator $\tilde{T}:\mathcal{H}\rightarrow\mathcal{H}$ such that, \begin{align} \langle Tx,y\rangle =\langle x,\tilde{T}y\rangle, \end{align} $\forall x,y\in\mathcal{H}$ . Show that $T$ is continuous. My current solution is as follows: Assume for all $\delta>0$ there exists $n>N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that, \begin{align} \|x_{n}-x\|<\delta. \end{align} Then, \begin{align} \langle Tx_{n}-Tx,Tx_{n}-Tx\rangle &= \|Tx_{n}-Tx\|^{2}\\ &\leq\|Tx_{n}-Tx\|=\|T(x_{n}-x)\|\\ &\leq\|T\|\|x_{n}-x\|\rightarrow 0\text{ as }n\rightarrow\infty. \end{align} What am I doing wrong? I notice I do not use the existence of $\tilde{T}$ . Second Attempt: Assume $\langle x_{n},x\rangle \rightarrow \langle x,x\rangle$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$ . Then, given $\langle Tx,y\rangle = \langle x,\tilde{T}y\rangle$ , \begin{align} \langle Tx_{n},y\rangle &= \langle x_{n},\tilde{T}y\rangle\rightarrow_{n\rightarrow\infty}\langle x,\tilde{T}y\rangle=\langle Tx,y\rangle. \end{align} Therefore, $Tx_{n}\rightarrow Tx$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$ . Third Attempt: Assume $\|x_{n}-x\|\rightarrow 0$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$ . Then, \begin{align} \langle Tx_{n}-Tx,Tx_{n}-Tx\rangle=\langle x_{n}-x,x_{n}-x\rangle=\|x_{n}-x\|^{2}. \end{align} By assumption $\|x_{n}-x\|^{2}\rightarrow 0$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$ . Hence, \begin{align} \langle Tx_{n}-Tx,Tx_{n}-Tx\rangle = \|Tx_{n}-Tx\|^{2}\rightarrow 0\text{ as }n\rightarrow\infty. \end{align} Therefore, $T$ is continuous.

Then, given $\langle Tx,y\rangle = \langle x,\tilde{T}y\rangle$ , \begin{align} \langle Tx_{n},y\rangle =\langle x_{n},\tilde{T}y\rangle\rightarrow_{n\rightarrow\infty}\langle x,\tilde{T}y\rangle =\langle Tx,y\rangle. \end{align} Since $Tx_{n}\rightarrow Tx$ weakly, we know $Tx:=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}Tx_{n}$ exists which implies that $T\in\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{H},\mathcal{H})$ . Hence $\|T\|<\infty$ . So, \begin{align} \langle Tx_{n}-Tx,Tx_{n}-Tx\rangle &= \|Tx_{n}-Tx\|^{2}\\ &\leq\|Tx_{n}-Tx\|=\|T(x_{n}-x)\|\\ &\leq\|T\|\|x_{n}-x\|\rightarrow 0\text{ as }n\rightarrow\infty. \end{align} Therefore $T$ is continuous. Fifth Attempt Assume $x_{n}\rightarrow x$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$ . Then, given $\langle Tx,y\rangle = \langle x,\tilde{T}y\rangle$ , \begin{align} \langle Tx_{n},y\rangle =\langle x_{n},\tilde{T}y\rangle\rightarrow_{n\rightarrow\infty}\langle x,\tilde{T}y\rangle =\langle Tx,y\rangle. \end{align} Hence $Tx_{n}\rightarrow Tx$ weakly. Define $f_{x}(y):=\langle Tx,y\rangle$ , then $f_{x}:\mathcal{H}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is a linear operator. Now, \begin{align} f_{x_{n}}(y)=\langle Tx_{n},y\rangle\rightarrow_{n\rightarrow\infty}\langle Tx,y\rangle=f_{x}(y). \end{align} Further, \begin{align} |f_{x_{n}}(y)|=|\langle Tx_{n},y\rangle|\leq\|Tx_{n}\|\|y\|\implies\|f_{x_{n}}\|\leq\|Tx_{n}\|. \end{align} Also, \begin{align} \|f_{x_{n}}\|\geq\frac{|f_{x_{n}}(Tx_{n})|}{\|Tx_{n}\|}=\|Tx_{n}\|. \end{align} Hence, $\|f_{x_{n}}\|=\|Tx_{n}\|$ . We now show $\|f_{x_{n}}\|_{\infty}<\infty$ , \begin{align} |f_{x_{n}}(Tx)|=|\langle Tx_{n},Tx\rangle|\rightarrow_{n\rightarrow\infty}|\langle Tx,Tx\rangle|=\|Tx\|^{2}, \end{align} hence, $\sup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}|f_{x_{n}}(Tx_{n})|<\infty$ and so by the UBP $\sup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\|f_{x_{n}}\|<\infty$ . This implies $\|Tx_{n}\|<\infty$ for all $x_{n}$ and so $\|T\|<\infty$ . Hence, \begin{align} \langle Tx_{n}-Tx,Tx_{n}-Tx\rangle &= \|Tx_{n}-Tx\|^{2}\\ &\leq\|Tx_{n}-Tx\|=\|T(x_{n}-x)\|\\ &\leq\|T\|\|x_{n}-x\|\rightarrow 0\text{ as }n\rightarrow\infty. \end{align} Therefore $T$ is continuous.","Note: Please do not give a solution; I am curious to understand why my solution is incorrect, and would prefer guidance to help me complete the question myself.

However for $n,m$, $ \left\|{l_n-l_m}\right\| \geq \left\|{y_n-y_m}\right\|$ , so I can't guarantee that $(l_n)_{n \in{} \mathbb{N}}$ is Cauchy.",,"['linear-algebra', 'functional-analysis', 'linear-transformations']"

Let $f$ be a measurable function and let there be a sequence of measurable sets $E_n \uparrow \{f\neq 0 \}$ with $\mu(E_n) < \infty$ for each $n\in \mathbb N$. Prove: $$\lVert f\rVert_\infty = \sup \left \{ \int_\Omega \lvert fg\rvert \, d\mu  : g\in \mathcal L^1(\Omega, \mathcal A, \mu), \lVert g \rVert_1 \leq 1 \right \}.$$ My attempt: If $g\in \mathcal L^1(\Omega, \mathcal A, \mu)$ and $\lVert g \rVert _1 \leq 1$ then $$\int \lvert fg\rvert \, d\mu \leq \lVert f\rVert_\infty \rVert g \lVert _1 \leq \lVert f\rVert_\infty$$ by the Hölder inequality. Taking the supremum over all such $g$ gives us the $\geq$ part. Now, for $\leq$, I am only able to prove it under the assumption that $\mu$ is $\sigma$-finite: Let $\epsilon > 0$. Let $E_n \uparrow \Omega$ with $\mu (E_n) < \infty$ for each $n\in \mathbb N$. Define $N_\epsilon := \{ f > \lVert f \rVert _\infty - \epsilon\}$. Now we have $$N_\epsilon = N_\epsilon \cap \bigcup_{n\in \mathbb N}E_n = \bigcup_{n\in \mathbb N} (N_\epsilon \cap E_n)$$  and by continuity of $\mu$ there must be some $n\in \mathbb N$ with $\mu (N_\epsilon \cap E_n) > 0$. Call the corresponding set $M$. Fix such an $n\in \mathbb N$ and define  $$g:= \frac{1_M}{\mu(M)}.$$ Clearly, $\lVert g \rVert_1 = 1$ and $$\int \lvert fg \rvert \, d\mu \geq \lVert f\rVert _\infty - \epsilon.$$ Letting $\epsilon \to 0$ proves the statement. But how do I prove it under the weaker assumption in the exercise? Thanks for your help!","I want to prove the following: Let $(\Omega, \mathcal A, \mu) $ be a measure space.
