0,The pushout $F_\alpha(H)$ of $H \overset{\pi}{\longleftarrow} \mathbb{Z}^{\ast H} \overset{\alpha^{\ast H}}{\longrightarrow} G^{\ast H}$,The pushout  of,F_\alpha(H) H \overset{\pi}{\longleftarrow} \mathbb{Z}^{\ast H} \overset{\alpha^{\ast H}}{\longrightarrow} G^{\ast H},"$\require{AMScd}$ Definition 1: If $G$ is a group and $X$ is a set, define $G^{\ast X} = \ast_{x \in X} G$ . This is functorial in both $G$ and $X$ : If $G$ and $H$ are groups, $\varphi: G \to H$ is a group homomorphism and $X$ is a set, we have a group homomorphism $\varphi^{\ast X}: G^{\ast X} \to H^{\ast X}$ that acts via $\varphi$ on each free factor. If $G$ is a group, $X$ and $Y$ are sets and $f: X \to Y$ is a set mapping, we have a group homomorphism $G^{\ast f}: G^{\ast X} \to G^{\ast X}$ that sends the $x$ -th free factor to the $f(x)$ -th free factor. If $G$ and $H$ are groups, $\varphi: G \to H$ is a group homomorphism, $X$ and $Y$ are sets and $f: X \to Y$ is a set mapping, we have the following commutative diagram: $$ \begin{CD} G^{\ast X} @>G^{\ast f}>> G^{\ast Y}\\ @V \varphi^{\ast X} V V @VV \varphi^{\ast Y} V\\ H^{\ast X} @>>H^{\ast f}> H^{\ast Y} \end{CD} $$ Definition 2: If $G$ is a group, define $\pi: \mathbb{Z}^{\ast G} \to G$ to be the group homomorphism that sends the $g$ -th free generator to $g$ . If $G$ and $H$ are groups and $\varphi: G \to H$ is a group homomorphism, we have the following commutative diagram: $$ \begin{CD} \mathbb{Z}^{\ast G} @>\mathbb{Z}^{\ast \varphi}>> \mathbb{Z}^{\ast H}\\ @V \pi_G V V @VV \pi_H V\\ G @>>\varphi> H \end{CD} $$ Definition 3: Let $G$ be a group and $\alpha: \mathbb{Z} \to G$ be a group homomorphism. Define a functor $F_\alpha: \mathsf{Grp} \to \mathsf{Grp}$ in the following way: Given a group $H$ , define $F_\alpha(H)$ to be the pushout of the following diagram: $$ \begin{CD} \mathbb{Z}^{\ast H} @>\alpha^{\ast H}>> G^{\ast H}\\ @V \pi V V\\ H \end{CD} $$ This means that we obtain the following commutative diagram: $$ \begin{CD} \mathbb{Z}^{\ast H} @>\alpha^{\ast H}>> G^{\ast H}\\ @V \pi V V @VV \beta V\\ H @>>\gamma> F_\alpha(H) \end{CD} $$ Given two groups $H_1$ and $H_2$ and a group homomorphism $\varphi: H_1 \to H_2$ , consider the cube diagram that consists of the diagrams for $F_\alpha(H_1)$ and $F_\alpha(H_2)$ as well as the maps $\varphi$ , $\mathbb{Z}^{\ast \varphi}$ and $G^{\ast \varphi}$ : In this diagram, the front and back squares are commutative as $F_\alpha(H_1)$ and $F_\alpha(H_2)$ are by definition the pushouts of the upper left parts. The top square is commutative by the previous observation from definition 1. The left square is commutative by the previous observation from definition 2. Now, consider the maps $\gamma_2 \circ \varphi: H_1 \to F_\alpha(H_2)$ and $\beta_2 \circ G^{\ast \varphi}: G^{\ast H_1} \to F_\alpha(H_2)$ . We have $\beta_2 \circ G^{\ast \varphi} \circ \alpha^{\ast H_1} = \beta_2 \circ \alpha^{\ast H_2} \circ \mathbb{Z}^{\ast \varphi} = \gamma_2 \circ \pi_2 \circ \mathbb{Z}^{\ast \varphi} = \gamma_2 \circ \varphi \circ \pi_1$ . Hence, since $F_\alpha(H_1)$ is the pushout of $\mathbb{Z}^{\ast H_1}$ along $\alpha^{\ast H_1}$ and $\pi_1$ , we have a unique map, which we will call $F_\alpha(\varphi): F_\alpha(H_1) \to F_\alpha(H_2)$ , with $\gamma_2 \circ \varphi = F_\alpha(\varphi) \circ \gamma_1$ and $\beta_2 \circ G^{\ast \varphi} = F_\alpha(\varphi) \circ \beta_1$ . Hence we obtain the following commutative cube diagram: It can be shown that $F_\alpha$ is indeed a functor. Additionally, from the commutative cube diagram above, it is clear that there is a natural transformation $\operatorname{id}_\mathsf{Grp} \Rightarrow F_\alpha$ . The question Does the functor $F_\alpha$ have a common name? Where can I read more about this functor? Can you give any reference? Does the functor $F_\alpha$ preserve limits?

Namely the triangle inequality holds $|g + h|\leq |g| + |h|$ .  An example would be $G = \Bbb{Z}$ together with $|\cdot| =$ absolute value. Now suppose that you have a finite set of functions $f_i : G\to G, i = 1..n$ , which are typically not group homomorphisms in applications.  Now take the space of $\Bbb{Z}$ -linear combinations of the $f_i$ , $X = \{ \sum_{j=1}^m \lambda_j f_j : \lambda_j \in \Bbb{Z}\}$ .  This forms an abelian subgroup of simply the set of all functions $\{f: G \to G\}$ under pointwise $+$ .

4,A Conjecture in Low-Dimensional Topology.,A Conjecture in Low-Dimensional Topology.,,"Context I looked through a book called ""Problems in Low-Dimensional Topology,"" where Rob Kirby lists a set of problems. He provides a list of problems, states their conjectures, and describes any progress on the problems. The book was published in 1995, so I don't know if some of the problems that Kirby stated are still open or proven.  There is one problem that stood out for me. Problem 1.8 (Stallings) Suppose $\beta$ is a word in the generators $\sigma_1 , . . . , \sigma_{n−1}$ and their inverses in the braid group $B_n$ . If the length of $\beta$ is minimal over all words representing the same element of $B_n$ , call β minimal. Conjecture: If the last letter of a minimal word $\beta$ is $\sigma_i^\epsilon$ , then the word $\beta\sigma_i$ is again minimal $(\epsilon = \pm1)$ . Question My first question is a matter of understanding the statement. What does it mean to be minimal? Is it saying that for a word $\beta$ with a last letter of $\sigma_i^\epsilon$ and an inverse in the braid group, if it's in its reduced form representing the same element of $B_n$ (which doesn't make sense because how can a reduced word represent the same element of a group?) then $\sigma_i$ is again minimal?

A subgroup $H$ of $G$ is residual if there exists a subset $S \subseteq G \setminus H$ and elements $g_1 , g_2 \in G$ such that $G \setminus H = S \cup g_1^{-1} S g_1$ and $S, g_2^{-1}S g_2$ , and $g_2 S g_2^{-1}$ are disjoint subsets of $G \setminus H$ . Given a group $G$ , let $L(G)$ denote its group von Neumann algebra, which is generated by the left regular representation $\lambda : G \to U(\ell^2(G))$ . Since $\delta_e$ is a cyclic and separating for $L(G)$ , $x \mapsto x \delta_e$ is a linear isometry with dense range. In particular, using this fact, given any $x \in L(G)$ , we can write $x = \sum_{g \in G} x_g \lambda_g$ for some scalars $x_g \in \mathbb{C}$ (Fourier coefficients) satisfying $\sum_{g \in G} |x_g|^2 < \infty$ and $\lambda_g$ denotes the unitary induced by $g \in G$ from $G$ 's left regular representation. The von Neumann algebra $L(G)$ comes with a unique trace $\tau : L(G) \to \mathbb{C}$ given by $\tau (x) = \langle x \delta_{e} , \delta_e \rangle_{\ell^2(G)}$ , making $L(G)$ is a type $II_1$ factor (because $G$ is ICC).

The version of the problem I'm interested in is the following: Let $\ R_N\ $ be the right circular shift by one place of strings of bits of length $\ N=2^r\ $ : $$ (R_NS)_i=S_{(i-2)\pmod{N}+1}\ , $$ $\ S_0\ $ be a random string of bits of length $\ N\ $ , $\ X_1$$\,X_2,$$\,\dots,X_j,$$\,\dots\ $ a sequence of independent random integers distributed uniformly over the set $\ \{0,$$\,1,$$\,2,$$\,\dots,$$\,N-1\}\ $ and $\ C_1,C_2,\dots,C_j,\dots\ $ any sequence of strings of bits of length $\ N\ $ .

The problem is to determine a finite sequence $\ C_1,C_2,\dots,C_M\ $ such that at least one of the strings $\ S_1$$\,S_2,$$\,\dots,S_M\ $ is guaranteed to be zero. The origin of the problem is a more general one appearing as question $7$ of the senior A-level Tournament of the Towns paper of autumn $2009$ . In the solution sheet for that paper it is proved by induction that such a finite sequence always exists. While preparing an answer to this question (now closed), I discovered the following solution for $\ N=4\ $ : \begin{align} C_1&=0000\\C_2&=1111\\C_3&=0101\\C_4&=1111\\C_5&=0011\\C_6&=1111\\C_7&=0101\\C_8&=1111\\C_9&=0001\\C_{10}&=1111\\C_{11}&=0101\\C_{12}&=1111\\C_{13}&=0011\\C_{14}&=1111\\C_{15}&=0101\\C_{16}&=1111  \end{align} My initial proof that this sequence works comprised an unenlightening collection of casework. As I was tidying it up, however, I noticed some relations between the order of the appearance of the terms in the solution and the lengths of their orbits under the action of the group of circular  shifts, and I eventually came up with the following proof: First note that length of the orbit of a string $\ S\ $ of bits of length $\ N\ $ is $\ \ell\ $ under the action of the group $\ G_N\ $ of circular shifts if and only if $\ \ell=2^k\ $ for some $\ k\in\{0,1,2,\dots,r\}\ $ ; and $S\ $ is periodic with period $\ \ell\ $ . If the string $\ C\ $ has an orbit of length $\ p<\ell\ $ (and is hence periodic with period $\ p=2^j\ $ for some $\ j<k\ $ ) then the length of the orbit of $\ C\oplus S\ $ is $\ \ell\ $ . If the length of $\ S_0$ 's orbit is $1$ , then either $\ S_0=0000\ $ or $\ S_0=1111\ $ , and so either $\ S_1=1111\ $ or $\ S_2=0000\ $ . If the length of $\ S_0$ 's orbit is $2$ then so are those of $\ S_1\ $ and $\ S_2\ $ . Therefore either $\ S_2=0101\ $ or $\ S_2=1010\ $ , the only $4$ -long bit strings with period $2$ . In the first case, $\ S_3=0000\ $ , while in the second, $\ S_3=1111\ $ and $\ S_4=0000\ $ . If the length of $\ S_0$ 's orbit is $4$ and it has even parity , then the length of the orbits of $\ S_1,S_2,S_3\ $ and $\ S_4\ $ will also be $4$ and they will also all have even parity.  Therefore $\ S_4\in\{0011,0110,1100,1001\}\ $ , the set of all $4$ -long bit strings of even parity with an orbit of length $4$ .  Therefore $\ S_5\in\{0000,$$\,0101,$$\,1111,$$\,1010\}\ $ and has an orbit of length $1$ or $2$ . If $\ S_5\ne0000\ $ and we repeat steps $2$ to $4$ as steps $6$ to $9$ , then at least one of $\ S_6, S_7\ $ or $\ S_8\ $ must be $\ 0000\ $ by the same argument as above. This shows that if $\ S_0\ $ has even parity, then at least one of $\ S_1\ $ to $\ S_8\ $ must be $\ 0000\ $ . If $\ S_0\ $ has odd parity, then so do $\ S_1\ $ to $\ S_8\ $ , and therefore $\ S_9\ $ must have even parity.  If $\ S_9\ne0000\ $ , we simply repeat steps $2$ to $8$ as steps $10$ to $16$ , and the same argument as above shows that at least one of $\ S_{10}\ $ to $\ S_{16}\ $ must be $\ 0000\ $ .

I think there might be something wrong with my proof, since most of the solutions I found emphasizing on proving $G_I$ is a direct product, but I somehow wrote quite a lot proving $K_i \leq G_I$ instead. I would appreciate if you can help locate the mistake. Exercise: Let $K_1, K_2, \dots, K_n$ be non-abelian simple groups and let $G = K_1 \times K_2 \times\dots\times K_n$ . Prove that every normal subgroup of $G$ is of the form $G_I = K_{i_1} \times K_{i_2} \times\dots\times K_{i_m}$ for some subset $I = \{i_1, i_2, \dots, i_m\}$ of $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$ . My attempts: Suppose $H$ is a non-trivial normal subgroup of $G$ . We prove first the following claim. Claim: For each $i \in \{1,2,\dots,n\}$ , either $K_i \leq H$ , or every $h \in H$ can be written as $h = k_1k_2\dots k_n$ with $k_j \in K_j$ and $k_i = 1$ . It suffices to establish the case $i = 1$ . Assume that there is some element $h = k_1k_2\dots k_n$ with $k_1 \neq 1$ . For any $g\in K_1$ , by the normality of $H$ we know $^gh = \,^gk_1k_2\dots k_n \in H$ , and it follows $^ghh^{-1} = [g, k_1] \in H$ . Hence, the group $[K_1,k_1] $ generated by $\{[g,k_1]:g\in K_1\}$ is a subgroup of $H\cap K_1$ . It remains to prove that $[K_1,k_1] $ is normal in $K_1$ , which follows from the following fact: Given any $x \in K_1$ , $^x[g,k_1] = [xg,k_1][x,k_1]^{-1} \in [K_1,k_1]$ . Also, $[K_1, k_1] \neq \{1\}$ , because there must be some $g$ not commutative with $k_1$ , otherwise $\langle k_1 \rangle$ would be an abelian normal subgroup of $K_1$ , a contradiction. Thus, $[K_1, k_1] = K_1$ by the simplicity of $K_1$ , that is, $K_1 \leq H$ . We have proved the claim . Denote $J=\{j: K_j \leq H, j\in\{1,2,\dots,n\}\}$ . Thus $G_J$ is a subgroup of $H$ . By the claim above, every element $h\in H$ can be written as $h = k_{j_1}k_{j_2}\dots k_{j_m}$ , hence also an element of $G_J$ . Therefore, $G_J = H$ , and we have proved the exercise. edit: I have correct the typos as Mr. Arturo Magidin pointed out in his first and second comment, also I have replaced ""Henceforth"" by ""Hence"". I apologize for my carelessness; I am really not in form yesterday. Also I am not a native speaker of English, so I make a lot of mistakes typing a long paragraph like this when feeling low. I also modify the notation of conjugate as suggested by Mr. Arturo Magidin. So $^xy$ stands for $xyx^{-1}$ , and $[x,y]$ for $xyx^{-1}y^{-1}$ . Following this convention, the equation $$^x[g,k_1] = [xg,k_1][x,k_1]^{-1}$$ means $$^x[g,k_1] = x(gk_1g^{-1}k_1^{-1})x^{-1} = xgk_1g^{-1}(x^{-1}k_1^{-1}k_1x)k_1^{-1}x^{-1} = (xgk_1g^{-1}x^{-1}k_1^{-1})(k_1xk_1^{-1}x^{-1}) = [xgk_1(xg)^{-1}k_1^{-1}](xk_1x^{-1}k_1^{-1})^{-1} = [xg,k_1][x,k_1]^{-1}.$$","I have written down a proof for an exercise from Chapter 4.5 in Dummit & Foote's Abstract Algebra .

Alperin and I couldn't understand two of the passages. Hypotheses and notations $G$ is a finite group with the following properties: $G$ is not nilpotent; Every proper homomorphic image of $G$ is elementary; $G$ has a unique minimal normal subgroup $N$ ; $N$ is a $p$ -group for some prime number $p$ (and thus it's elementary abelian). First unclear passage At this moment of the paper, Alperin is proving that $N = O_p(G)$ , the $p$ -core of $G$ (that is, the largest normal $p$ -subgroup of $G$ ). To do so, he argues that $O_p(G)$ is an elementary abelian group in the following fashion: ""If $O_p(G)$ is not elementary abelian then the Frattini subgroup $D(O_p(G))$ of $O_p(G)$ is not $1$ so must contain $N$ , by (3). But then $O_p(G)/D(O_p(G))$ is a central factor of $G$ so that $N$ will be also. Hence, $N$ is a central factor and $G/N$ is nilpotent so we have contradicted (1)."" The terminology ""central factor"" was new to me and I had to search for possible definitions. The only one that made sense in this context was the following: if $H,K \trianglelefteq G$ are normal subgroups and $K \leq H$ , we say that $H/K$ is a central factor of $G$ if $H/K \leq Z(G/K)$ . Based on this definition, I assumed that a (normal) subgroup of $G$ is a central factor if it's contained in $Z(G)$ (this agrees with the definition of central factor in Groupprops Subwiki if the normal subgroup is abelian, which is our case). Is there any other definition which makes more sense here? I can see that $D(O_p(G))$ is not trivial and contains $N$ . I also agree that $O_p(G)/D(O_p(G))$ is a central factor of $G$ , since $G/D(O_p(G))$ is nilpotent by (2) so $O_p(G)/D(O_p(G))$ is the $p$ -Sylow subgroup of $G/D(O_p(G))$ and is abelian. But how this implies that $N$ is a central factor? (Knowing this, I am able to understand the final sentence of the argument.) Second unclear passage The paper continues and Alperin has just proved that $N = O_p(G)$ . He then invokes the Schur-Zassenhaus theorem and concludes that $G$ is the semi-direct product of $N$ and another subgroup $K$ (but I think this is irrelevant for my question). We arrive at this sentence: ""The uniqueness of $N$ now gives us that $N$ is not a central factor of $G$ ; hence, no non-trivial character of $N$ is stabilized by $G$ ."" Since $Z(G)$ is normal in $G$ , it must contain $N$ if it isn't trivial. But then we could argue that $G$ is nilpotent as before, a contradiction. Thus, $Z(G) = 1$ and $N$ is clearly not a central factor. This intuitively implies that no non-trivial irreducible character of $N$ is stabilized by $G$ , but I cannot give a proof. Could someone help me here too? I said that it was ""intuitive"" so here is what my intuition says: We know that $N$ is elementary abelian so we understand what the irreducible characters of $N$ look like. If $\chi$ is a non-trivial character of $N$ , there is $n \in N$ such that $\chi(n) \neq 1$ and hence $\chi(n)$ equals some primitive $p$ -th root of unity. Since $G$ has trivial center, there is $g \in G$ such that $gng^{-1} \neq n$ . It is reasonable to expect that $\chi(gng^{-1}) \neq \chi(n)$ (which would imply that $g$ does not stabilize $\chi$ ) but $\chi$ can indeed assume repeated values and this inequality is not (immediately) guaranteed. We would need to search for the right $n$ and the right $g$ . Instead of dealing with individual elements of $N$ , I also tried working with the isomorphism between $N$ and its dual group. If this isomorphism were compatible with the actions of $G$ , the result would follow from the fact that $Z(G) = 1$ . But this isomorphism is not canonical, so you can correctly guess that my calculations didn't take me where I wanted. Maybe there is some combinatorial argument or maybe we have enough information to understand the action of $G$ on $N$ , I don't know... To sum it up Which definition of ""central factor"" is Alperin probably using? If I am using the correct one: How to prove that $N$ is a central factor in the first passage?

It's an old result of Suzuki that if $G$ possesses a self-centralizing subgroup of order $p^2$ then $G$ has maximal class, and in fact the converse is true. However, the proof of the converse appears not particularly easy, at least as far as I know. See Huppert, Section III.14, or Leedham-Green--McKay for definitions. I will refer to Huppert for specific results. The only proof I know is the following: if $x\in G$ lies outside all $2$ -step centralizers $K_i=C_G(\gamma_i(G)/\gamma_{i+2}(G))$ for $2\leq i\leq n-2$ then $C_G(x)$ has order $p^2$ by Huppert, III.14.13. This proof is easy, just an induction up the central series. Thus the problem is proving that not all maximal subgroups are $2$ -step centralizers. If $|G|$ is small, say around $|G|\leq p^{p+1}$ , then there are not enough $K_i$ for all maximal subgroups to be one of the $K_i$ . If $|G|$ is large though, one appears to have to use the fact that $G$ cannot be exceptional, i.e., all $K_i$ are in fact equal (Huppert, III.14.18), or at least $G/Z(G)$ is not exceptional and hence the $K_i$ are at most two maximal subgroups (Huppert, III.14.6). So my question is, if one is only trying to prove the existence of self-centralizing subgroups of $p$ -groups of maximal class, is there a faster way that doesn't involve using the lack of exceptionality? One naive approach is to use induction on $|G|$ . The result holds for $G/Z(G)$ , so you obtain a self-centralizing subgroup there. The preimage is a subgroup $B$ of order $p^3$ , containing $Z(G)$ . If this subgroup is non-abelian then any subgroup $A$ of order $p^2$ other than $Z_2(G)\leq B$ is self-centralizing. But if $B$ is abelian, this doesn't work. And I don't see why $B$ is not abelian. Equivalently, $B$ can be contained in the $2$ -step stabilizer $C_G(Z_2(G))$ , and I don't see how to force it not to be, or at least that there is a choice of it not being. It seems that I end up back at trying to make sure there are enough maximal subgroups that are not the $K_i$ to allow me to make a choice, but I cannot see how to do this without proving the much stronger results about exceptionality.","Let be a finite -group.

The coboundary operator $\delta$ maps each $C_n$ into the next, $C_{n+1}$ in accordance with the rule $$(\delta f)(\xi_0, \xi_1, \dots, \xi_n)\\ =\xi_0f(\xi_1, \dots, \xi_n) \\  +\sum_{t=1}^{n} (-1)^t (\xi_0, \xi_1, \dots, \xi_{t-2}, \xi_{t-1}\xi_{t}, \xi_{t+1}, \dots, \xi_{n}) \\  +f(\xi_0\xi_1, \dots, \xi_{n-1})\xi_n . {\mbox something \ that \ I \ can \ not \ read},  $$ And let $Z^n=Z^n(A, \Omega)= \ker (C^n\longrightarrow C^{n+1})$ , and let $B^n=B^n(A, \Omega)= Im (C^{n-1}\longrightarrow C^{n})$ . The quotient group $Z^n/B^n$ is called the $n$ -dimensional cohomology group of the double $\Omega$ -module $A$ . We write it $$H^n(A, \Omega) = Z^n/B^n.$$ In the part something that I can not read , in the above formula , probably it is written $(-1)^{n+1}$ , but I am not sure. I have some confusions about coboundary operators and 1-cocycles and computing cohomology, and I can not find where the bugs are.

I know that they are not exactly the same, but I think they are not compatible unless for instance we replace the definition of Neukirch as above. Also I have ambiguity about cocycles and 1-cocycles. If the things in Neukirch's book are correct, then I expected the cocycle should be $f(\sigma\tau)=\sigma f(\tau)+f(\sigma)$ , and I am confused with $\delta(f(\sigma, \tau))=\sigma f(\tau)-f(\sigma\tau)+f(\sigma)\tau$ , and I can not see the compatibility.","I was reading cohomology from Neukirch's book, and there he referenced to Hall's book.

For reference, here is my ""ugly"" proof, which is very long and perhaps even wrong: $\newcommand{\quot}[2]{#1/#2} \newcommand{\normaleq}{\trianglelefteq}$ For a normal subgroup $N \normaleq G$ , we prove that the map $\varphi$ defined by $H \mapsto \quot H N$ establishes a bijection between subgroups of $G$ containing $N$ and subgroups of $\quot GN$ . Well-defined : we check that for a subgroup $H \leq G$ containing $N$ , $\quot HN$ is actually a subgroup of $\quot GN$ . Well, $e\in H \implies eN = e_{G/N} \in \quot HN$ ; associativity is inherited from $\quot GN$ ; $g,h\in H \implies (gN)(hN) =: (gh)N  \in \quot HN$ ; and $g\in H \implies (gN)^{-1} = g^{-1} N \in \quot HN$ . Inverse : we construct an explicit inverse using the canonical projection $\pi : G \to \quot GN$ ( $g\mapsto gN$ ), namely we show that $\pi^{-1}$ is the desired inverse. First, we want to show for a subgroup $H \leq G$ containing $N$ , $\pi^{-1}(\quot HN) := \{g\in G: gN \in \quot HN\} = H$ . The ( $\supseteq$ ) containment is true because $h\in H \implies hN \in \quot HN$ ; and the ( $\subseteq$ ) containment is true because $\quot HN = \{hN : h \in H\}$ implying that $gN \in \quot HN \implies gN = hN$ for some $h\in H$ , i.e. $g = hn \in H$ since $n$ is some element of $N \subseteq H$ . Second, we show that for a subgroup $S$ of $\quot GN$ , $\pi^{-1}(S)$ is a subgroup of $G$ containing $N$ , and $\varphi(\pi^{-1}(S)) = S$ . We know that inverse images via homomorphisms are subgroups, and since $S$ in particular contains $e_{G/N}$ , the inverse image $\pi^{-1}(S) \supseteq \pi^{-1}(\{e_{G/N}\}) = \ker(\pi) = N$ . Next suppose that $g\in \pi^{-1}(S) \implies \pi(g) = gN \in S$ . This tells us that $\varphi(\pi^{-1}(S)) \subseteq S$ . Now suppose $gN \in S$ .  (i.e. is an arbitary element of $S \leq \quot GN$ since its elements are all of the form $gN$ for some $g\in G$ ). Well, $\pi(g) = gN \in S \implies g\in \pi^{-1}(S) \implies gN \in \varphi(\pi^{-1}(S))$ , and so $S \subseteq \varphi(\pi^{-1}(S))$ , completing the proof. a bijection between normal subgroups of $G$ containing $N$ and normal subgroups of $\quot GN$ . Well-defined : we check that for a normal subgroup $H \leq G$ , $\quot HN$ is actually a normal subgroup of $\quot GN$ . In part (a) above, we already verified all the ""subgroup"" related claims, so we just need to verify normality. Let $h\in H$ be arbitrary. Then for any $g\in G$ , we have $(gN)(hN)(gN)^{-1} = ghg^{-1} N$ , but since $ghg^{-1} \in H$ , $ghg^{-1} N \in \quot H N$ , so indeed $\quot HN$ is normal in $\quot GN$ .

In part (a) above, we already verified all the ""subgroup"" related claims, so we just need to verify normality, namely that the inverse image of a normal subgroup is normal. Well if $x\in \pi^{-1}(S)$ for a normal subgroup $S \normaleq GN$ , then for any $g \in G$ , $gxg^{-1}$ will satisfy $\pi(gxg^{-1}) = \pi(g) \pi(x) \pi(g^{-1}) \in S$ (since $\pi(x) \in S$ and $S$ is normal), so indeed $gxg^{-1} \in \pi^{-1}(S)$ . But $x\in \pi^{-1}(S)$ was arbitrary, so $g \pi^{-1}(S) g^{-1} \subseteq \pi^{-1}(S)$ for all $g\in G$ , which suffices to prove that $\pi^{-1}(S) \normaleq G$ (since $gNg^{-1} \subseteq N \implies Ng^{-1} \subseteq g^{-1} N$ and also $gN \subseteq Ng$ where again $g$ is taken over all of $G$ ).","The lattice isomorphism/correspondence theorem for groups is an elegant statement about (normal) subgroups of containing corresponding with (normal) subgroups of .

Thankfully mse does know , and I don't feel bad about not coming up with this idea. It did get me thinking, though. I know a lot of techniques for showing subgroups of certain orders do exist (Sylow/Hall Theorems, etc.) but almost no techniques for showing subgroups of certain orders don't exist. Obviously Lagrange's Theorem is the main obstruction, and even the linked question we take a purported copy of $C_{14}$ in $G$ and build a counterexample to Lagrange.

So my question is Are there general techniques for showing $G$ has no subgroup of order $k$ , even if $k \mid |G|$ ?

Thankfully mse does know , and I don't feel bad about not coming up with this idea. It did get me thinking, though. I know a lot of techniques for showing subgroups of certain orders do exist (Sylow/Hall Theorems, etc.) but almost no techniques for showing subgroups of certain orders don't exist. Obviously Lagrange's Theorem is the main obstruction, and even the linked question we take a purported copy of in and build a counterexample to Lagrange. But at least at present the technique in that answer, as well as techniques to similar nonexistence theorems I've found, feel somewhat ad hoc. So my question is Are there general techniques for showing has no subgroup of order , even if ? I'm interested both in ways to extend the reach of Lagrange's Theorem, as well as in other invariants (even if they might be complicated).

97,No Simple Group of Order 1080,No Simple Group of Order 1080,,"I came up with what I think is a nice elementary proof, and I just want to double-check there are no mistakes: Proof that there is no simple group $G$ of order $1080=2^33^35$ . Suppose $G$ is simple. The candidates for the number of $5$ -Sylow subgroups are $6$ , $36$ , and $216$ . $216$ is impossible as the $5$ -Sylows would then be in the centers of their normalizers, implying the existence of a normal $5$ -complement, by the Burnside transfer theorem. $6$ is impossible as it would imply a non-trivial homomorphism from $G$ to $\frak{S}_6$ (the transitive action of $G$ on the $6$ $5$ -Sylows), which is impossible as $|G|>|\frak{S}_6|$ and $G$ is simple. Thus, a $5$ -Sylow $P_5$ has a normalizer $N_5$ of order $\frac{1080}{36}=30$ .  Since $P_5$ is cyclic of order $5$ , ${\rm Aut}(P_5)$ is cyclic of order $4$ .  Thus, the $3$ -elements in $N_5$ commute with the $5$ -elements.  Note that in $N_5$ , the resulting cyclic subgroup of order $15$ has index $2$ and thus is normal.  The (Sylow) $3$ -subgroup of $N_5$ is thus normal (and unique) as it is characteristic in a normal subgroup. Now consider a $3$ -element $z$ that centralizes a $5$ -element.  (These exist in $N_5$ .)  This exists in some $3$ -Sylow, and in a group of order $27$ every centralizer has order at least $9$ .  ( $p$ -groups have non-trivial centers, so non-central elements are centralized by themselves and and non-trivial element of the center.)  Thus, $|Z(z)|$ is divisible by $45$ .  However, the $5$ -Sylow can't be normal in $Z(z)$ as its normalizer in $G$ only has order $30$ .  The only candidates for the number of $5$ -Sylows in $Z(z)$ is $6$ , since if it were $36$ , it would be a normal subgroup (the set of all $p$ -Sylows is closed under conjugation).  Thus, each $3$ -element $z$ that centralizes a $P_5$ centralizes $6$ of them. But we saw above that each $P_5$ is normalized by a unique $3$ -subgroup $\langle z\rangle$ of order $3$ .  We now see that each such $\langle z\rangle $ normalizes $6$ $5$ -Sylows.  Since there are $36$ $5$ -Sylows, there are $6$ such $\langle z\rangle $ (one-sixth as many as there are $5$ -Sylow subgroups), and $G$ acts non-trivially on them by conjugation, and thus has a non-trivial homomorphism to $\frak{S}_6$ .  Thus $G$ cannot be simple.","I came up with what I think is a nice elementary proof, and I just want to double-check there are no mistakes: Proof that there is no simple group of order .
