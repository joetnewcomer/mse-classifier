0,Using Norms to Determine Factorisations in the Gaussian Integers,Using Norms to Determine Factorisations in the Gaussian Integers,,"In the set $\mathbb{Z}[i]:=\{a+bi:a,b\in\mathbb{Z}\}$ of Gaussian Integers, we define the norm to be $N:\mathbb{Z}[i]\to\mathbb{Z}$ by $$ N(\alpha)=\alpha\alpha^*=a^2+b^2,\ \forall\alpha=a+bi\in\mathbb{Z}[i]. $$ We then use this to determine factorisations of Gaussian integers.

5,Are there infinitely many primes of the form $3^p-4$?,Are there infinitely many primes of the form ?,3^p-4,"My question is the same as you saw: Are there infinitely many primes of the form $3^p-4$, when $p$ prime? I'm a complete novice in this type of questions with few or no theoretical background. Um, so I could only try it by brute-force for all primes $p<15,000$. Then, I found something interesting: it seems not so plausible, because $p$ with $3^p-4$ prime gets rapidly rare, as $p$ increases.

Let's take following ingredients : $\omega, \omega^2$ the usual $3$thd degree roots of unity, $u$ a primitive root of $\Bbb Z_p$, $\mathfrak{p}$ the ideal $\Bbb Fp$.

In the book, we let $\phi:C_1 \longrightarrow C_2$ a non constant map of smooth curves and we let $P\in C_1$ . Then we define the ramification index of $\phi$ at $P$ , denoted by $e_\phi(P)$ as $$e_\phi(P)=\text{ord}_P(\phi^{*}t_{\phi(P)}) \text{ ,}$$ where $t_{\phi(P)}\in K(C_2)$ is a uniformizer at $\phi(P)$ . I'm trying to break it down into parts. First of all, $\phi^{*}t_{\phi(P)}$ = $t_{\phi(P)} \circ \phi$ Now, $\text{ord}_P(\phi^{*}t_{\phi(P)})$ is the max $d$ for which $\phi^{*}t_{\phi(P)} \in M_p^d$ , meaning the max $d$ for which we can express $(t_{\phi(P)} \circ \phi)$ as a product of maps $f_1...f_d$ such that $f_i(P)=0$ for all $i$ , meaning that $P$ would be a zero of multiplicity $d$ for $(t_{\phi(P)} \circ \phi)$ . It's good to see that $(t_{\phi(P)} \circ \phi)(P)=0$ and then, necessarily $(t_{\phi(P)} \circ \phi)\in M_p^d$ for $d \geq 1$ . The book defines $\phi:C_1 \longrightarrow C_2$ to be unramified at $P$ if $e_\phi(P)=1$ , which means that $(t_{\phi(P)} \circ \phi) \in M_p^1$ , in other words, we can't express $(t_{\phi(P)} \circ \phi)$ as a product of maps with $P$ being a zero for said maps. All in all, what I understand from this is that $P$ is a zero of multiplicity $1$ for $(t_{\phi(P)} \circ \phi)$ . If $e_\phi (P)>1$ we said that $\phi$ ramifies at $P$ , meaning we can split $(t_{\phi(P)} \circ \phi)$ as the product of maps, each of them having $P$ as a zero. My question is, what does all of it means? Is there any geometric intuition for this definition? I ""understand"" the technicalities behind the definition, but I don't understand why do we define this concept and why do we define it this way.

Note that $y$ is odd, since $y$ even would give a contradiction $\mod{2}$ . Hence $\frac{y-1}{2}, \frac{y+1}{2} \in \mathbb{Z}$ . So we can rewrite the equation to: $\frac{y-1}{2} \frac{y+1}{2} = x^3$ . Claim $\frac{y-1}{2}$ and $\frac{y+1}{2}$ are coprime. Proof: Let $d = \gcd(\frac{y-1}{2},\frac{y+1}{2})$ . Let $\frac{y-1}{2} = a d$ and $\frac{y+1}{2} = b d$ for some $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}$ . Then $y + 1 = bd \,2$ and $y-1 = a d\, 2$ , so $y + 1 = ad\,2+2$ , it follows that $bd = ad + 1$ , so $d(b-a)=1$ , so $d =\pm1$ . So we conclude that indeed $\frac{y-1}{2}$ and $\frac{y+1}{2}$ are coprime. Since they are coprime we can perform a descent. That gives $\frac{y-1}{2} = e^3$ and $\frac{y+1}{2} = f^3$ for some coprime $e,f \in \mathbb{Z}$ . After adding and subtracting these two equations we find that $y = e^3+f^3$ and $1 = f^3 - e^3$ . Am I now correct to say that the only solutions are $f = 1, e=0$ and $f = 0, e=-1$ ? This gives $y=\pm1$ . In the above equation we see that in both cases $x = 0$ .

Proof valid?,,"As Eric Schneider asked, ""Am I mistaken, or does the following (actually) elementary proof work?"" Theorem. Any integer which is a square modulo every prime is a square. Lemma. For any odd prime $p$ , any integer which is a square modulo $p$ is a square modulo every power of $p$ . Proof. Let $a$ be any square modulo $p$ . Let $r$ be any integer $\geqslant 1$ . Use induction on $r$ . (I adopt this approach to avoid a bug, spotted by Ingix, in my earlier proof.) The result is true for $r=1$ . Suppose, by the inductive hypothesis, that $a$ is a square modulo $p^{r-1}$ . Then $a=x^2\mod p^{r-1}$ for some $x$ . Work modulo $p^r$ . If $x=0$ then $a=0=0^2$ modulo $p^r$ . Otherwise, for $0\leqslant k<p$ , $(kp^{r-1}+x)^2=jp^{r-1}+a\mod p^r$ for some $0\leqslant j<p$ . Suppose two distinct $kp^{r-1}+x$ had the same square. Then \begin{align*} (kp^{r-1}+x)^2&=(lp^{r-1}+x)^2\mod p^r\tag{ with $k\ne l$}\\ (k^2-l^2)p^{2r-2}+2(k-l)p^{r-1}x&=0\mod p^r\\ 2(k-l)p^{r-1}x&=0\mod p^r\tag{ as $r>1$}\\ 2(k-l)x&=0\mod p \end{align*} $p$ is an odd prime and $x\ne 0\mod p$ , so $p\nmid 2x$ , so the last line is false. Therefore, by the pigeonhole principle, the values of the $p$ distinct expressions $(kp^{r-1}+x)^2$ for $0\leqslant k<p$ are the values $jp^{r-1}+a$ for $0\leqslant j<p$ in some order. In particular, in one case $j=0$ , so $a$ is a square modulo $p^r$ . Proof of theorem. Let $a$ be a square modulo every prime. Then, by Lemma 1, $a$ is a square modulo every odd prime-power. Then, by the Chinese remainder theorem, $a$ is a square modulo every odd integer. Then, by Eric Schneider's argument , with $n=2$ , but applying it only to $p$ being an odd prime and not to $p=2$ , for every odd prime $p$ , $p^r\; ||\;a$ for an even number $r$ . Thus either $a=x^2$ or $a=2x^2$ for some integer $x$ . Let $p$ be a prime where $p=\pm 3\mod 8$ . Then, modulo $p$ , $a$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$ by supposition, but 2 is not a quadratic residue, so $2a$ is not a quadratic residue, so $2a$ is not a square in $\mathbb{Z}$ . Thus for every integer $x$ , $(2x)^2=4x^2\ne 2a$ , so $2x^2\ne a$ , so $a$ is a square, as required. I see no elementary proof of this theorem, with no use of quadratic reciprocity (QR).

89,Are there infinitely many primes with digit sums of the form $n^2+1$?,Are there infinitely many primes with digit sums of the form ?,n^2+1,"The motivation for this question is from one of well known Landau Problems which asks for proof of the statement: Are there infinitely many primes $p$ such that $p − 1$ is a perfect square? In other words: Are there infinitely many primes of the form $n^2 + 1$ . But this is not what I am asking. Before I ask my question let me explain the scenario. A prime $p$ is called $\color{blue}{\text{Nice prime}} \ $ if sum of its digits is of the form $n^2+1$ For example $37\rightarrow 3+7=3^2+1$ . The primes sum of whose digits is of the form $n^2$ (Eg $31\rightarrow 4=2^2$ ) or $n^2-1$ (Eg $71\rightarrow 8=3^2-1$ ) will be called Almost Nice primes.

If you have an Almost Nice Prime of the form $n^2-1$ then adding $2\times10^k$ to it (here $k$ is the highest power of $10$ in decimal expansion of $n^2-1$ ) will give you a Nice prime if it is a prime (by it I mean $n^2-1+2\times10^k$ ).  In a similar manner, if a prime $p$ is an Almost Nice prime of the form $n^2$ then if $n^2+10^k$ is a prime then it will be a Nice prime.

I have the feeling that I am missing a very simple and intuitive proof, but it has eluded me so far.",,"['number-theory', 'elementary-set-theory', 'parametric']"

96,Non-positivity of partial sums of certain Legendre symbols,Non-positivity of partial sums of certain Legendre symbols,,"Let $T(c, k, p) := \sum_{i = 0}^{k} \left( \frac{i^2 + c}{p} \right) $, where $p$ is a prime number. It is known, that $T(c, p - 1, p) = -1$ for $p \nmid c$. Now, I would like the sequence $T(c, 0, p), T(c, 1, p), \ldots, T(c, p - 1, p)$ to be non-positive. So I wrote a program for searching such pairs $c < p$ and the result is quite interesting: there is no such pair for $c \in [12, 999]$ and $p < 200000$. The pairs that were found are $\{(2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 11), (3, 5), (3, 7), (5, 7), (5, 13), (5, 17), (6, 7), (6, 13), (7, 11), (10, 11), (11, 13)\}$.

Another question is whether for given $c$ the first moment when this partial sum achieves a positive value is bounded by some constant.

I believe that the answer for this one is negative. EDIT: regarding the first question, all partial sums are non-positive iff they all belong to $\{0, -1, -2\}$. So it would be enough to prove that for sufficiently large $p$ there will always be 3 consecutive quadratic residues or 3 consecutive quadratic nonresidues in $\left( \frac{0^2 + c}{p} \right), \left( \frac{1^2 + c}{p} \right), \ldots, \left( \frac{(p-1)^2 + c}{p} \right)$.

98,Can a multi-perfect number be a perfect square?,Can a multi-perfect number be a perfect square?,,"It is fairly easy to show that a perfect number $\Gamma$ cannot be written in the form $\Gamma=n^2$ for integer values of $n$.

This question is out of pure curiosity, as I can not find an answer online. UPDATE: I now know that for even $k$ and/or an even $k$-perfect number $R$ the answer is no, as it follows from contradiction by assuming $R=n^2$ and then computing $$\sigma(R)=\prod_{i=1}^{l}\sigma(p_i^{2a_i}), $$ where $n=\prod_{i=1}^lp_i^{a_i}$ (here all $p_i$ are distinct primes and all $a_i\geq1$).
