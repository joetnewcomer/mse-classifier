I don't think  that my approach is an elegant approach but this is the best I can do. (I am a high school student. But I have managed to gather a lot of information about advanced maths from the internet such as calculus, linear algebra, Set theory, number theory, coordinate geometry, modular arithmetic etc. So if the answer needs advanced maths then I don't have any problem, but not too advanced maths.) Note: in this question I will include $0$ as a natural number, I know that this is rather controversial in the mathematical community but I will request not to debate about it the comment section. ( $\mathbb{N}=\{0,1,2,\cdots\}$ ) $\underline{\text{My Question}:-}$ If we put the natural numbers on the Ulam Spiral this way (Sorry I couldn't find a picture where the spiral starts at $0$ , so I just put the wikipedia picture here. Just replace $n$ with $n-1$ ) Then what is the formula for the cartesian coordinate on the integer lattice where each natural number lies? $\underline{\text{My Attempt}:-}$ Define a bijective function $U:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{Z×Z}$ Where $U(n)$ gives the cartesian coordinates of $n$ on the ulam spiral. For example: $U(0)=(0,0)$ $U(1)=(0,1)$ $U(2)=(1,1)$ $U(3)=(1,0)$ $U(4)=(1,-1)$ $\vdots$ Let, $U(n)=(x_n,y_n)$ It's obvious that how $x_n$ and $x_{n+1}$ or $y_n$ and $y_{n+1}$ would compare to each other would depend on which part of the ulam spiral $n$ is in. So, I divided the spiral into segments. I will denote them as $L_1$ and $L_2$ such that $|L_1|=L$ and $|L_2|=L+1$ for $L\in\mathbb{N}$ and define $0_2=\{0\}$ . For example- $0_1=\{\}=\varnothing$ $(\text{We won't consider this ever again, since it is just the null set})$ $0_2=\{0\}$ $1_1=\{1\}$ $1_2=\{2,3\}$ $2_1=\{4,5\}$ $2_2=\{6,7,8\}$ $\vdots$ So- (Please forgive me. I cannot create pictures, so I just drew it. But I hope you understand that what $L_1$ and $L_2$ are) Here I tried to show how each segment looks like on the spiral. A bit of investigations gives us the result- $\begin{align}&L_1=\{L^2,\cdots,L^2+L-1\}\\&L_2=\{(L+1)^2-(L+1),\cdots,(L+1)^2-1\}\end{align}$ For $L\in\mathbb{N}$ It's obvious that- ●If $n\in L_1$ where $L$ is odd, then $x_{n+1}=x_n$ and $y_{n+1}=y_n+1$ ●If $n\in L_2$ where $L$ is odd, then $x_{n+1}=x_n-1$ and $y_{n+1}=y_n$ ●If $n\in L_1$ where $L$ is even, then $x_{n+1}=x_n$ and $y_{n+1}=y_n-1$ ●If $n\in L_2$ where $L$ is even, then $x_{n+1}=x_n+1$ and $y_{n+1}=y_n$ So, $$U(n+1)=\begin{cases}(x_n,y_n+1),&\text{if $n\in L_1$ and $L$ is odd}\\(x_n,y_n-1),&\text{if $n\in L_1$ and $L$ is even}\\(x_n-1,y_n),&\text{if $n\in L_2$ and $L$ is odd}\\(x_n+1,y_n),&\text{if $n\in L_2$ and $L$ is even}\end{cases}$$ If we say that, $(a,b)+(x,y)=(a+x,b+y)$ Then, $$U(n+1)=\begin{cases}(x_n,y_n)+(0,1),&\text{if $n\in L_1$ and $L$ is odd}\\(x_n,y_n)-(0,1),&\text{if $n\in L_1$ and $L$ is even}\\(x_n,y_n)-(1,0),&\text{if $n\in L_2$ and $L$ is odd}\\(x_n,y_n)+(1,0),&\text{if $n\in L_2$ and $L$ is even}\end{cases}$$ And since, $\begin{align}&(0,1)=U(1)\\&(1,0)=U(3)\\&(x_n,y_n)=U(n)\end{align}$ We have, $$U(n+1)=\begin{cases}U(n)+U(1),&\text{if $n\in L_1$ and $L$ is odd}\\U(n)-U(1),&\text{if $n\in L_1$ and $L$ is even}\\U(n)-U(3),&\text{if $n\in L_2$ and $L$ is odd}\\U(n)+U(3),&\text{if $n\in L_2$ and $L$ is even}\end{cases}$$ This is the worst recurrence relation I have ever seen. Update: To get the formula for $L$ and whether $n\in L_1$ or $n\in L_2$ , we need to solve for $L$ and $k$ in- $\begin{cases}L^2+k=n\\1<L<n\\-L\leq k\leq L-1\end{cases}$ With a little different definition for $L_1$ and $L_2$ The definition I used here will require solving for $L$ and $k$ in $\begin{cases}L^2+k=n\\0\leq L<n\\0\leq k\leq 2L\end{cases}$ (for more details, read this question of mine) The solutions would be: $$\begin{align}&L=\left\lfloor\sqrt{n}\right\rfloor\\&k=n-\left\lfloor\sqrt{n}\right\rfloor^2\end{align}$$ (For more details, read this answer to the question I linked above) It's clear that, If $0\leq k\leq L-1$ then $n\in L_1$ If $L\leq k\leq 2L$ then $n\in L_2$ So we can write our recurrence formula as- $$U(n+1)=\begin{cases}U(n)+U(1)&\text{if $0\leq k\leq L-1$ and $L$ is odd}\\U(n)-U(1)&\text{if $0\leq k\leq L-1$ and $L$ is even}\\U(n)-U(3)&\text{if $L\leq k\leq 2L$ and $L$ is odd}\\U(n)+U(3)&\text{if $L\leq k\leq 2L$ and $L$ is even}\end{cases}$$ $$\begin{align}U(n+1)=&\begin{cases}U(n)+U(1),&\text{if $0\leq n-\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor^2\leq\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor-1$ and $\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor$ is odd}\\U(n)-U(1),&\text{if $0\leq n-\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor^2\leq\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor-1$ and $\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor$ is even}\\U(n)-U(3),&\text{if $\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\leq n-\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor^2\leq 2\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor$ and $\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor$ is odd}\\U(n)+U(3),&\text{if $\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\leq n-\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor^2\leq 2\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor$ and $\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor$ is even}\end{cases}\end{align}$$ It made it worse, but at least now we have the recurrence relation only in terms of $n$ . $\underline{\text{Some more questions}:-}$ Besides my original question in the $\text{'My Question'}$ part, I have a few more questions. $1)$ How can I get further from my recurrence relation to derive an explicit formula? $2)$ If deriving a recurrence is really not the way to approach this problem then I would request some answer to question with a different approach.","For the last few days I've been wondering about the question below.

21,"Is there any good reason not to define $0^0=1$ , such as contradictions in algebra or arithmetic?","Is there any good reason not to define  , such as contradictions in algebra or arithmetic?",0^0=1,"Math people: The title is the question: Is there any good reason not to define $0^0=1$ , such as contradictions in algebra or arithmetic? I searched for similar questions before I posted this question, and couldn't find any.  After I posted it,  I got some comments citing similar questions.  There is a similar question at What values of $0^0$ would be consistent with the Laws of Exponents? .  I checked some of the other questions in the links in the comments and the links posted with those links.  There is a closer match at How to define the $0^0$? That question was closed as a duplicate, but the older, duplicated question was not identified.  I could not find a convincing answer anywhere to my essential question: ""does defining $0^0=1$ lead to contradictions in algebra and arithmetic?"" I'll leave it up to others to decide whether my question is a duplicate.  If it is, maybe you can close this question and give a better (in my opinion) answer to one of the older questions. Let me get one thing out of the way up front: yes, I know ""$0^0$"" is an indeterminate form.  That is, if $f$ and $g$ are real-valued functions with $f(t) \to 0^+$ as $t \to 0$ and $g(t)\to 0$ as $t \to 0$, then you don't know what $\lim_{t\to 0}f(t)^{g(t)}$ is, or even whether exists, without more information.  I don't consider this a good reason to declare that $0^0$ itself must be considered undefined.  I know many people will disagree with me here.  I expect at least one answer and some comments arguing why this is a good reason for $0^0$ to be considered undefined.  Everyone is entitled to their opinion, and you are free to leave such an answer.  I will not attempt to change your mind, beyond what I write in this question. If you define $f(x,y) = x^y$, then $f$ cannot be continuous on $[0,\infty) \times \mathbb{R}$ no matter what value, including $1$, you assign to $f(0,0)$.  But why should every function have to be continuous? If the mathematical community ever does come to the consensus that $0^0=1$, and I were teaching calculus students about limits involving indeterminate forms, I probably would not even mention the question of whether $0^0$ itself had a value, because it probably just confuse the students.  They probably wouldn't even notice the omission. To me, a ""good reason"" not to define $0^0=1$ would be if this definition resulted in a contradiction, when used in expressions involving multiplication and exponentiation of real numbers and the rules used to simplify such expressions.  Here is an attempt to produce such a contradiction: assuming $0^0=1$, $(0^0)^2=1^2=1$, and $(0^0)^2=0^{(0*2)}=0^0=1$.  No contradiction.  In constrast, if you define $0/0 = 1$ and you want the associative property to hold (a reasonable expectation), then you can derive the contradiction $1=0/0=(2*0)/0=2*(0/0)=2*1=2$. It just occurred to me that there is another good reason for not declaring officially that $0^0$ must always equal $1$: if defining $0^0=0$ does not lead to contradictions in algebra or arithmetic, either. I am not claiming $0^0 = 0/0$.  Of course you can never divide by zero, or raise zero to a negative power. Of course, when people use power series, they use $0^0=1$ all the time, and no one complains.  I have read that ""$0^0=1$"" is used often in combinatorics, but I don't know much about combinatorics. Based on what I have seen in the older questions, their answers, and the answers and comments to this question, it seems that no one has discovered any way in which defining $0^0$ to be $1$ leads to contradictions when using the usual rules of multiplication and exponentiation.  It also seems that defining $0^0$ to be $0$ does not lead to such a contradiction. So I'm guessing it is impossible to produce such a contradiction.  But I have never heard of anyone wanting to define $0^0$ as $0$.","Math people: The title is the question: Is there any good reason not to define $0^0=1$ , such as contradictions in algebra or arithmetic? I searched for similar questions before I posted this question, and couldn't find any.  After I posted it,  I got some comments citing similar questions.  There is a similar question at What values of $0^0$ would be consistent with the Laws of Exponents? .  I checked some of the other questions in the links in the comments and the links posted with those links.  There is a closer match at How to define the $0^0$? That question was closed as a duplicate, but the older, duplicated question was not identified.  I could not find a convincing answer anywhere to my essential question: ""does defining $0^0=1$ lead to contradictions in algebra and arithmetic?"" I'll leave it up to others to decide whether my question is a duplicate.  If it is, maybe you can close this question and give a better (in my opinion) answer to one of the older questions. Let me get one thing out of the way up front: yes, I know ""$0^0$"" is an indeterminate form.  That is, if $f$ and $g$ are real-valued functions with $f(t) \to 0^+$ as $t \to 0$ and $g(t)\to 0$ as $t \to 0$, then you don't know what $\lim_{t\to 0}f(t)^{g(t)}$ is, or even whether exists, without more information.  I don't consider this a good reason to declare that $0^0$ itself must be considered undefined.  I know many people will disagree with me here.  I expect at least one answer and some comments arguing why this is a good reason for $0^0$ to be considered undefined.  Everyone is entitled to their opinion, and you are free to leave such an answer.  I will not attempt to change your mind, beyond what I write in this question. If you define $f(x,y) = x^y$, then $f$ cannot be continuous on $[0,\infty) \times \mathbb{R}$ no matter what value, including $1$, you assign to $f(0,0)$.  But why should every function have to be continuous? If the mathematical community ever does come to the consensus that $0^0=1$, and I were teaching calculus students about limits involving indeterminate forms, I probably would not even mention the question of whether $0^0$ itself had a value, because it probably just confuse the students.  They probably wouldn't even notice the omission. To me, a ""good reason"" not to define $0^0=1$ would be if this definition resulted in a contradiction, when used in expressions involving multiplication and exponentiation of real numbers and the rules used to simplify such expressions.

57,What exactly do systems of equations represent?,What exactly do systems of equations represent?,,"Systems of equations are taught pretty early in American curriculum. We are taught methods of substitution and methods of elimination in order to solve them. We are taught how to use matrices or graphs as alternative strategies to encode/visualize them. There are linear systems of equations...there are non-linear systems of equations...and there are systems of equations with 1 or many variables. However, to this day, I still do not really understand what systems of equations are . I've tried to find an abstract interpretation of systems of equations but without much success. I am very interested in figuring out this ""systems of equations abstraction"" because there are canonical statements (e.g. the classic ""You need as many equations as variables to find a solution"") that I would very much like to prove. I've tried myself to come up with some semblance of an abstraction but I have not made much progress. I will illustrate the case for one equation with one variable and two equations with two variables (which is where I run in to trouble). One Equation - One Variable Consider the purely arbitrary equation: $$a = b +\alpha x \ \text{ where}\  \alpha \neq 0$$ The effort to solve this equation can be rephrased as ""Find me the $x$ that maps to $a$ through the function $f(x) = b + \alpha x$ ."" In effect, therefore, this question is one requiring that we find the inverse function $f^{-1}$ that, when $a$ is given as input, $x$ will be output. Solving for $x$ by virtue of substracting $b$ from both sides and dividing both sides by $\alpha$ effectively amounts to determining the inverse function such that: $f^{-1}(x')=\frac{x' -b}{\alpha}$ ...for future purposes, also note that this can be denoted as $f^{-1}\big(f(x)\big)=\frac{f(x) -b}{\alpha}$ . Plugging in $a$ for $x'$ we arrive at the solution to this equation, which is $f^{-1}(a)=\frac{a-b}{\alpha}$ . So far, so good. Two Equations - Two Variables Consider the following two arbitrary equations of two variables: $$a=b+\alpha x + \beta y \ \text{ where}\  \alpha, \beta \neq 0$$ $$c=d +\gamma x + \delta y \ \text{ where}\  \gamma, \delta\neq 0$$ Following the same logic of the ""One Equation - One Variable"" section, solving for $x$ and $y$ can be viewed as constructing the inverse functions for the two above equations, which can be recast as specific instances of: $$g\big( (x,y) \big) = b+\alpha x + \beta y$$ $$h \big ( (x,y) \big ) = d +\gamma x + \delta y$$ As to how one solves for these inverses, I have not the faintest clue. Obviously, we could revert to the standard methods of substitution and arrive at the following bulky solutions: $$ y = \frac{\alpha \Big ( h \big((x,y)\big) -d \Big) -\gamma g\big( (x,y) \big)+\gamma b}{\delta \alpha - \beta \gamma}$$ and $$ x = \frac{g\big( (x,y) \big) -b - \beta y}{\alpha}$$ However, these are not inverses of the functions $g$ and $h$ . In fact...I don't really even know WHAT these equations represent. If you were to plug in the value of $y$ in the final equation for $x$ (I omitted that for brevity), you can see that the $y$ equation and the $x$ equation both have $g\big ( (x,y) \big)$ and $h \big ( (x,y) \big)$ in them ...so these equations are inverse-like .
