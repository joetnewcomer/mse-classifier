Ideally, we would give each party exactly $x_i\cdot S$ seats, but this number is not an integer, so we have to round it. Naturally, each party demands that its fraction will not be rounded 'too much', i.e, each party demands at least its fractional share $x_i\cdot S$ rounded down to the nearest integer.

At this point you can guess what my question: How to solve this exercise without using tools outside the ones provided by Ireland & Rosen in their book? I know from other places that the value of $L(1,\chi)$ for real $\chi$ is always positive. So, extending my question: Is there an easy way to show, for general real Dirichlet character $\chi$, that $L(1,\chi)>0$, given that we know it's not zero? Let me also note that I am aware of a proof of nonvanishing of L-functions which at the same time proves that the value is positive, but this wouldn't be a valid answer to my question - as far as I can recall, the proof was by itself pretty nontrivial, and I'm looking for something that, in theory, could've been figured out by a reader of the book who, say, has not encountered analytic number theory before.

For what values of $n$ can $A$ be partitioned into 3 subsets $A_1, A_2, A_3$, such that sum of the elements of each of them are equal? My Attempt: For the set $A$ to be partitioned in the required way, sum of all elements of $A$ must be divisible by $3$. Thus a necessary condition is: $1 + 2 + .. + n = n(n+1)/2 \equiv 0 $ mod $3$ which implies $n = 3t $ or $n = 3t-1$ for integer $t>2$ On trial with values of t up to $t=11$, I found that in every case, $A$ can be partitioned according to the given conditions.

If $\mathfrak P$ is a prime of $K$ which lies over $P$, then $\mathcal O_K/ \mathfrak P$ is an extension of $\mathcal O_k/P$ having degree $f = f(\mathfrak P/P)$.  The Galois group of any finite extension of finite fields is cyclic. Shouldn't the decomposition group $G_P = \{ \sigma \in G : \sigma \mathfrak P = \mathfrak P\}$ also be cyclic then?  I thought $G_P$ modulo the inertia group (which is trivial, since $P$ is unramified) is isomorphic to the Galois group of residue fields. And if that's true, shouldn't the restricted Artin map $$k_v^{\ast} \rightarrow I_k \rightarrow G_P$$ which sends an $x$ to $Frob(P,K/k)^{\nu_P(x)}$, be automatically surjective?  The Frobenius element is the thing that generates $G_P$ when $P$ is unramified, and any $x$ with value $1$ maps to it.

Let $A$ be a Dedekind domain with quotient field $K$, $L$ a finite separable extension of $K$ of degree $n$, and $B$ the integral closure of $A$ in $L$.  The ideal norm $N_{L/K}$ is usually defined multiplicatively by the formula $N_{L/K}(\mathfrak P) = P^f$, where $P = \mathfrak P \cap A$ and $f = f(\mathfrak P / P)$. Another way to define it is as follows: for fractional ideals $M$ and $N$ of $B$, the localizations $M_P$ and $N_P$ are free $A_P$-modules, so there is a $K$-module automorphism $\psi$ of $L$ for which $\psi(M_P) = N_P$.
