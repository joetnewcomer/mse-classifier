2,Homeomorphisms of X form a topological group,Homeomorphisms of X form a topological group,,"So I'm just learning about the compact-open topology and am trying to show that for a compact, Hausdorff space ,$X$, the group of homeomorphisms of $X$, $H(X)$, is a topological group with the compact open topology.  This topology has a subbasis of sets $\{f\in H(X):f(C)\subseteq V\}=S(C,V)$ for compact $C$, open $V$.  This is my first attempt at getting to know this topology, so I'd appreciate some help with the part of a proof I have so far, possibly a better way to go about proving this, and any other help understanding this topology. First, let $c:H(X)\times H(X)\rightarrow H(X)$ be composition.  For $f,g\in H(X)$, let $S(C,V)$ be a subbasis set with $f\circ g\in S(C,V)$.  So $f(g(C)\subseteq V$ which means $f\in S(g(C),V)$ and $g\in S(C,f^{-1}(V)$.  The product of these open sets works since if $h_1(C)\subseteq f^{-1}(V)$ and $h_2(g(C))\subseteq V$, then $h_2\circ h_1(C)\subseteq V$. Then let $i:H(X)\rightarrow H(X)$ be inversion.  Take a subbasis set $O=\{g:g(C)\subseteq U\}$ and consider $i^{-1}(O)=\{g^{-1}:g(C)\subseteq U\}$.  If $h^{-1}\in i^{-1}(O)$, then one thing we have is that $h(C)\subset U$, but I'm not totally sure what to do with this.  This part seems like it should be easier, but I am just not seeing it.

This question is quite annoying, since it is quite difficult to calculate the sum even after you construct an example. However, it seems like no matter how I constructed a set of positive measure, there is a region that have a lot of point in it (yet this region is not necessarily dense). This suggest that when summed up, the holes should be covered up somehow and thus there would be an open interval, and so the answer is yes.

EDIT2: So Camilo's answer is gone. I am looking at the convolution method right now. Because the convolution is continuous, if it is nonzero I am done. But then there is no guarantee that the convolution is nonzero even if $x\in A+B$. I still need help with this direction. Can someone give me some hints?

Now if you apply Camilo's method, it is possible that your $I$ would be one of the $I_{n}$ above, and your $J$ is one of the $J_{m}$ above. No matter which $I_{n},J_{m}$ you have, the argument does not work. Rewrite $m=3q+r$ where $0\leq r\leq 2$.

In general, we cannot recover $\tau$ from $\tilde{\tau}$. For instance, let $\tau$ denote the usual topology on $\mathbb{Q}$, and $\sigma$ denote the discrete topology on $\mathbb{Q}$. Then $\tilde{\tau} = \tilde{\sigma}$, but $\tau \not = \sigma$. I'm wondering whether we can use local connectedness to get rid of this problem. Question. Let $X$ denote a set. Suppose $\tau$ and $\sigma$ are topologies on $X.$ Suppose $(X,\tau)$ and $(X,\sigma)$ are locally connected spaces. From $\tilde{\tau} = \tilde{\sigma}$, can we deduce $\tau = \sigma$?

14,"For an $n$-dimensional object, how many types of holes are possible?","For an -dimensional object, how many types of holes are possible?",n,"Update 2012-06-06 : At some point I'll attempt to answer my own question by using a dual-fluid model that places the dimensionality and connectivity of ""solids"" and ""holes"" on an equal footing. With that same model, I should also be able to explain how Betti numbers are related. Incidentally, the dual-fluid model seems to provide an interesting alternative way of viewing Poincaré duality. Original Question 2012-05-31: (Please bear with my non-standard terminology; I am not a topologist.) In $n=3$ space an object such as an $n$-ball can have only type of hole. For the simplest case of one such hole in one $3$-ball, the result is a ring. If the ring is smoothed down and narrowed, the result is a $1$-sphere or circle. It is easy to generalize ""hole"" to mean any topologically distinct, simple subtraction of substance from an $n$-ball. By ""simple subtraction"" I mean this: Define a removal $n$-ball that is initially identical to the first ball. Expand the removal ball slightly by uniformly expanding the $m$-ball defined by the $m$ axes, and contract it slightly by uniformly shrinking the ($n-m$)-ball defined by the remaining subspace of ($n-m$) axes. Intersect the resulting distorted removal ball with the first one. For the first $n$-ball, erase all substance from the locations where it intersects with the removal ball. This procedure results in three additional hole types for $n=3$ space: voids ($m=0$), splits ($m=2$), and erasures ($m=3$). The original definition of a hole for $n=3$ space becomes $m=1$. Thus using this generalized hole definition, $n$-space has $(n+1)$ hole types with labels $m=0,1,\ldots,n$. The $m=0$ case is always a void, $m=n-1$ is always a split, and $m=n$ is always an erasure. The space has $(n-2)$ ""true holes"" labeled $m=1,\ldots,n-2$, with the true holes being those that (a) leave the $n$-ball connected, and (b) provide a path through it. (If the second criterion (b) is omitted, $m=0$ voids could also be called true holes.) The thinning procedure mentioned earlier simplifies the resulting holes and provides an easy way to observe structure that is shared across all $n$-spaces. For example, an ($n=2,m=0$) void looks like a washer or ring drawn on paper, and it thins into a $1$-sphere. An ($n=3,m=1$) hole looks like a bagel, and also thins into a $1$-sphere. This pattern produces a very simple rule: Every $n$-space has ($n-2$) true holes, and each of those holes $m$ has the same fundamental topology as an ($n-m-1$)-sphere. Thus our space has one true hole, ($n=3,m=1$), with the fundamental topology of a $1$-sphere or circle, and a void, ($n=3,m=0$), which has the fundamental topology of a $2$-sphere (a hollow shell). For $n=4$ there are two true holes: ($n=4,m=1$) with the form of a $1$-sphere, and ($n=4,m=2$) with the form of a $2$-sphere. Addendum 2012-06-05: There's no reason for me to be overly abstract about any of this: A ""1"" indicates a ""filled n-cell"" rather than a vertex, and ""0"" an empty n-cell. Each solid shown is assumed to exist in empty space, so surrounding zeros are implied. Notice the (x,y) gap at the center of (4,2), which would allow any sufficiently thin plane-like object in 4D to pass through. At the same time, the object itself retains its structural integrity by forming a closed loop in the (z,t) plane. That loop can be seen easily in the 3x3 units surrounding the empty (x,y) unit. The (4,2) hole has no analog in 3D, although ironically its fundamental form is the same as a circle or a ring. It's just that in 4D a toroid ends up with two axes of freedom through its hole instead of just one. Addendum 2012-06-01: Here is a way to visualize why the different $m$ holes have significantly different properties. In 3D, a ring is a compact object containing a single (genus 1) ($n=3,m=1$) hole. Now the interesting thing about a single hole is that it enables a curious but well-defined relationship between two objects residing in the same $n$-space. In particular, if the hole is of size $m$, you can use it to ""point to"" any $m$-dimensional location on an object that is indefinitely larger in $m$ dimensions than the hole object. I'll call this the pointer theorem for future reference. The pointer theorem sounds a bit abstract, but it's really quite easy to visualize. Imagine a ring on a wire, for example. The ring is a compact object with a ($n=3,m=1$) hole in it, and the wire is another 3D object that is indefinitely larger than the ring in exactly one dimension. The pointer theorem therefore applies, so you should be able to ""relocate"" the ring to any point along the indefinitely long axis of the wire. And it's true! The ring can in fact be moved to ""point to"" any location on the wire, no matter how longer the wire is. Moreover, the relationship is non-trivial, since you cannot remove the ring from the wire without covering at least some other locations on the wire; the ring is ""strung"" onto the wire. While 3D space allows only one type of true hole, notice that a split ($n=3,m=2$), which consists of two ""nearby"" but separate objects, qualifies as a generalized hole. Does the pointer theorem apply to splits? Yes. The extended object for an $m=2$ hole, regardless of the space size $n$, is a sheet-like object that is indefinitely larger than the hole object in $m=2$ dimensions. Can the two such nearby objects point to any location on such a sheet? Yes. An ordinary sewing machine is a pretty good example, since it has paired parts above and below an indefinitely large sheet of fabric, and those paired parts can be used to stitch any point on a sheet of fabric. The problem in 3D, however, is that unlike the approximation provided by a sewing machine, a real split breaks the compact object apart into two disconnected units. Now look at the 4D case. For $n=4$ you have have two ""true holes,"" namely ($n=4,m=1$) and ($n=4,m=2$). Unlike the 3D case, either one of these holes can be used to create an continuous (internally connected) compact 4D object with genus 1. The pointer theorem says that an ($n=4,m=1$) hole can be used to point to any location on an indefinitely large rod-like or wire-like $n=4$ object. This makes the ($n=4,m=1$) hole into the 4D equivalent of a ring on a wire. Intriguingly, however, the reduced form of ($n=4,m=1$) is not a $1$-sphere, but a $2$-sphere, since $m-n-1=2$. That makes it topologically equivalent to a hollow ball in 3D space, rather than a ring! What is happening conceptually is that any 4D wire would be orthogonal to our 3D space, and would show up in intersection with our space as a $3$-ball trapped inside the hollow sphere. But what about that other 4D hole, ($n=4,m=2$)? It is a ""sheet-like"" hole, just like the one in the earlier 3D split example. The pointer theorem implies that you can ""string"" a compact object with a genus 1 ($n=4,m=2$) hole onto an indefinitely larger sheet-like 4D object, and then use that compact object to point to any location on the sheet. What's fascinating conceptually is that a compact genus 1 ($n=4,m=2$) object would remain both intact and ""stuck"" on such a sheet in very much the same way that a ring gets ""stuck"" on a long wire in 3D. My own phrase for this is the 4D abacus effect. Just as in 3D an abacus bead can be moved anywhere on a wire but remains trapped on that wire, in 4D a ""bead"" that has a ($n=4,m=2$) hole can be moved anywhere on a sheet, but remains trapped on that sheet. Note that this type of genus 1 ($n=4,m=2$) bead is equivalent to a $1$-sphere or ring, just as in the 3D abacus case. If the sheet was rotated into 3D space, this ring would show up as mysteriously connected pieces above and below the sheet. It would look very much like the 3D split in fact, with the addition of a hidden 4D link that keeps the pieces joined. There are infinitely many different abaci, incidentally. For every $n$-space the corresponding $n$-abaci uses $1$-sphere type beads -- that is, compact genus 1 objects with ($n=n,m=n-2$) holes -- strung onto ($n-2$)-objects. The $5$-abacus is interesting because it attaches a movable ring to any location within a 3D ""object."" Thus it might provide an interesting physics model for folks who like to model particles as loops attached to and mobile within a 3D space. You can also get a lot more complicated than that, of course, such as by increasing the genus and/or mixing together abaci of different dimensionality. The main point in all these examples of the pointer theorem is this: Holes with different $m$ cannot be equivalent because they cannot be strung onto the same kinds of objects. In 4D for example, an ($n=4,m=1$) hole can be strung onto a wire-like 4D object, but not onto a sheet-like 4D object. The other true hole type for 4D, ($n=4,m=2$), can be strung onto a sheet-like 4D object, however. There's another more subtle difference I should mention. While you can in principle use a ($n=4,m=2$) ""bead"" to point to any location on a wire-like 4D object, you cannot ""string"" such a bead onto that object. It simply falls off! To see why, imagine trying to capture a thread between two disconnected objects in 3D. The same problem of too many degrees of freedom applies for trying to string a ($n=4,m=2$) bead onto a wire-like 4D object. So, for any given embedding space $n$, its set of ($n+1$) true and generalized hole types {$m=0,1,\ldots{n}$} are all fundamentally different in terms of the types of interactions they provide between objects in that space. Finally, an observation: If embedding spaces are not used, the difference between these holes remain, but they get a lot harder to observe and characterize (I think). So with all of that, here's my simple question: Where do I find all of this in topology? I'm assuming there must be a similarly simple and regular way to classifying holes in higher dimensional spaces in terms of their sphere analogs, but I've had a lot of trouble finding it the last time I looked. (That was a couple of years ago, so maybe I need to look again.) Most of what I saw dived into the algebraic complexity and special terminology weeds so quickly that I had trouble figuring whether they were really relevant.","Update 2012-06-06 : At some point I'll attempt to answer my own question by using a dual-fluid model that places the dimensionality and connectivity of ""solids"" and ""holes"" on an equal footing.

In measure theory, we talk about a measure $\mu$ being ""continuous"" with respect to $\nu$ if the measures are related appropriately. It's my understanding that the idea of continuity is inextricable from some notion of topology. Moreover, in the context of Lebesgue measure $\lambda$, in the context of $[0, 1]$ with a typical $\sigma$-algebra, say $\mathcal{B}$, $\lambda$'s behavior seems to be related to the topology of $[0, 1]$, e.g. if I have a dense subset of $[0, 1]$, say $\mathbb{Q}$, then I can define the measure of a measurable set by a sequence of better and better coverings of the set by intervals with rational endpoints. And this seems to hold for any measure that is continuous with respect to $\lambda$. Further, say I defined $\mu(F) = \int_{F}g \, \mathrm{d}\lambda$, where $g$ is an appropriate non-negative integrable function. Then if I set $M(x) = \mu([a, x])$, then $M$ is continuous, but if I set $\mu$ to be something not $\lambda$-continuous, i.e. I don't define it by $g$, but $\mu$ gives positive measure to some singleton, then $M$ ceases to be continuous in $[0, 1]$. So my question: Is there a link between the ""continuity"" of a measure and the topology of the measure space? If so, then is there some way to define a topology on a measure space by the measure? For example, is there some way to say some set is ""dense"" with respect to the measure, in the way that we can approximate any measurable set's Lebesgue measure in $[0, 1]$ by covering it with intervals with rational endpoints? Any help is appreciated. Thanks!","I apologize if this question is a bit vague; I'm just wondering if there is a concept like what I'm talking about, or if I'm just lost.

Munkres, 2nd edition: Prove that if $X$ is an ordered set in which every closed interval is compact, then $X$ has the least upper bound property. My Attempt: Let $A$ be any non-empty subset of $X$ such that $A$ is bounded above in $X$ ; let $U$ be the set of all the upper bounds in $X$ of this set $A$ . Then $U$ is also a non-empty subset of $X$ . Case 1. If $A \cap U \not= \emptyset$ , let us suppose that $v \in A \cap U$ . Now as $v \in U$ , so $v$ is an upper bound of the set $A$ , by our definition of the set $U$ . Also, as every element of $U$ is an upper bound of the set $A$ and as $v \in A$ , so we must have $$ v \leq u \ \mbox{ for every element }  u \in U. $$ Thus $v$ is an upper bound of the set $A$ and $v \leq u$ for every upper bound $u$ of $A$ . Therefore $v$ is the least upper bound of the set $A$ . Case 2. Let us now suppose that $A \cap U = \emptyset$ . Then for every element $a \in A$ and for every element $u \in U$ , we must have $a < u$ . Let $a \in A$ and $u \in U$ be arbitrary. Then $a < u$ . Moreover, the closed interval $[a,u]$ is compact, by our hypothesis. Let $\mathscr{L}$ be the collection of all the closed intervals of the form $[x, y]$ , where $x \in A$ , $y \in U$ , and $[x,y] \subset [a,u]$ . That is, let $$ \mathscr{L} \colon= \big\{ \ [x, y] \ \colon \ x \in A, y \in U, a \leq x < y \leq u \ \big\}. \tag{*} $$ Then the interval $[a, u]$ itself is in $\mathscr{L}$ so that $\mathscr{L}$ is non-empty. If $\left[x_1, y_1 \right], \ldots, \left[x_n, y_n \right]$ be any finite subcollection of $\mathscr{L}$ , then we have $$ \bigcap_{j=1}^n \left[ x_j, y_j \right] = \left[ x_0, y_0 \right], $$ where $$ x_0 \colon= \max \left\{ x_1, \ldots, x_n \right\}, \qquad \mbox{ and } \qquad y_0 \colon= \min \left\{ y_1, \ldots, y_n \right\}. $$ Thus $\bigcap_{j=1}^n \left[ x_j, y_j \right]$ is again an interval in $\mathscr{L}$ and is therefore non-empty. Then $\mathscr{L}$ is a collection of non-empty closed sets in $[a,u]$ such that $\mathscr{L}$ has the finite intersection property. Since $[a,u]$ is compact, therefore the intersection of all the closed intervals in $\mathscr{L}$ is non-empty, by Theorem 26.9 in Munkres. That is, there is an element $p \in [a,u]$ such that $p \in [x,y]$ for all $x \in A$ and for all $y \in U$ for which $[x,y] \subset [a,u]$ . In particular, this $p \in [a, u]$ also, so that $$ a \leq p \leq u. \tag{1} $$ But $a$ was chosen to be an arbitrary element of set $A$ , and $u$ was chosen to be an arbitrary element of the set $U$ (i.e. $u$ was chosen to be an arbitrary upper bound for the set $A$ ). Thus the leftmost inequality in (1) implies that $p$ is an upper bound of the set $A$ , and the rightmost inequality in (1) implies that $p$ is also the least of all of the upper bounds of $A$ . Hence $p$ is the least upper bound of the set $A$ . But as $A$ was chosen to be an arbitrary non-empty subset of $X$ which was bounded above in $X$ , so we can conclude that $X$ has the least upper bound property. Is this proof correct?

38,Construction of the Universal Covering Space via Compact-Open Topology,Construction of the Universal Covering Space via Compact-Open Topology,,"Recently I've been self-studying the theory of covering spaces from ""Introduction to Topological Manifolds"", by John M. Lee. At the end of Chapter 11, there is an explicit construction of the universal covering space for a connected, locally path connected and semilocally simply connected topological space $X$ . Very briefly, the idea is as follows: take $x_{0}\in X$ , define $P(X,x_{0})$ to be the set of all paths in $X$ which start at $x_{0}$ , and let $\tilde{X}$ be the quotient set of $P(X,x_{0})$ by the relation: $\alpha \sim \beta$ if and only if $\alpha(1)=\beta(1)$ and $\alpha\simeq \beta$ are path-homotopic. We define $q\colon \tilde{X}\to X$ to be the map $q([\alpha]):=\alpha(1)$ . We later define a topology on $\tilde{X}$ by means of a basis, which turns $\tilde{X}$ into a simply connected, locally path connected space and $q$ into a covering map. However, some authors suggest that an alternative way to construct $\tilde{X}$ is to give $P(X,x_{0})$ the compact-open topology (that is, the subspace topology it inherits as a subset of $\mathcal{C}([0,1],X)$ ), and $\tilde{X}$ the quotient topology induced by the canonical map $\pi \colon P(X,x_{0})\to \tilde{X}$ . Nevertheless, I haven't been able to find a clear proof that $q\colon \tilde{X}\to X$ is the universal cover of $X$ . What I'm trying to do is imitate the proof in Lee's book, but using this alternative topology: most of the details of the proof are rather set-theoretic, so I've managed to reduce the problem of rewriting the proof to just having to prove these 4 facts: $\tilde{X}$ is a path connected topological space. $q\colon \tilde{X}\to X$ is continuous. $q\colon \tilde{X}\to X$ is open. For every $\alpha \in P(X,x_{0})$ and every open set $U\subseteq X$ such that $\alpha(1)\in U$ , the subset $$ [\alpha \cdot U]=\{ [\alpha \cdot \beta]\colon \beta \text{ is a path in } U \text{ such that } \beta(0)=\alpha(1) \} $$ is open in $\tilde{X}$ . Here are my ideas so far: $P(X,x_{0})$ is path connected (and hence $\tilde{X}$ is too): let $\tilde{x}_{0}=[c_{x_{0}}]$ be the class of the constant path at $x_{0}$ and $\alpha\in P(X,x_{0})$ be arbitrary. Define $F\colon [0,1]\times [0,1]\to X$ by $F(t,s)=\alpha(ts)$ . This is a continuous map, so by properties of the CO-topology, the map $f\colon [0,1]\to \mathcal{C}([0,1],X)$ given by $f(t)(s)=F(t,s)$ is continuous. Since $f(0)(s)=x_{0}$ , $f(1)(s)=\alpha(s)$ and $f(t)(0)=x_{0}$ , $f$ is a path in $P(X,x_{0})$ from $c_{x_{0}}$ to $\alpha$ . Therefore, $P(X,x_{0})$ is path-connected. Let $\operatorname{ev}\colon P(X,x_{0})\to X$ be the map defined by $\operatorname{ev}(\alpha)=\alpha(1)$ . This map is continuous (again, this is a general property of the CO-topology) and passes continuously to the quotient, inducing precisely the map $q$ , so $q$ is continuous. As of openness of $q$ , I'm not sure how to proceed: what I'm sure of is that, if $\operatorname{ev}$ is an open map (which I think it is), then $q$ is too. I believe that it should be possible to prove that basic open subsets of $P(X,x_{0})$ are mapped into open sets of $X$ . Let $[\alpha \cdot U]$ defined as above, we need to see that $\pi^{-1}([\alpha \cdot U])$ is open in $P(X,x_{0})$ . Take any $\gamma \in \pi^{-1}([\alpha \cdot U])$ , so that $\gamma \simeq \alpha \cdot \beta$ , where $\beta$ is a path in $U$ starting at $\alpha(1)$ . Let $V$ be the path component of $U$ which contains $\gamma(1)$ (and therefore, it contains $\alpha(1)$ ). Then $\gamma\in [\{1\},V]$ , where $[\{1\},V]$ is the basic open subset of $P(X,x_{0})$ given by all paths which end at some point of $V$ . From here I don't know how to continue: I think this open set is contained in $\pi^{-1}([\alpha \cdot U])$ , but I haven't got an idea to prove it (certainly, since we know ""a posteriori"" that $\tilde{X}$ is simply connected, every element of $[\{1\},V]$ is homotopic to $\alpha\cdot \eta$ , where $\eta$ is a path in $V$ from $\alpha(1)$ to the endpoint of such element). So far, are my ideas on the right track? Can someone help me especially with the last two statements? Thank you in advance! EDIT 1: I wanted to add some new insights on the proof of the last two statements: I think this could be a valid proof for openness of $\operatorname{ev}$ : let $A=[K_{1},U_{1}]\cap \dots \cap[K_{n},U_{n}]$ be a basic open set of $\tilde{X}$ , we need to prove that $\operatorname{ev}(A)$ is an open subset of $X$ . Take $x\in \operatorname{ev}(A)$ , so that there exists some $\alpha \in A$ such that $x=\alpha(1)$ . Let $B\subseteq X$ be the intersection of all $U_{i}$ 's such that $1\in K_{i}$ (if none of the $K_{i}$ contains $1$ , then $B:=X$ ), so $x\in B$ , and let $V$ be the path component of $B$ that contains $x$ (so $V$ is open in $X$ ). I claim that $V\subseteq \operatorname{ev}(A)$ . To see this, let $y\in V$ . For every $j$ such that $1\notin K_{j}$ , let $a_{j}=\max \{t\colon t\in K_{j}\}<1$ , and let $a=\max a_{j}$ . By continuity, one can choose some $a<b<1$ such that $\alpha([b,1])\subseteq V$ . Take any path $\gamma$ in $V$ from $\alpha(b)$ to $y$ and define $$ \beta(t)= \begin{cases} \alpha(t), & 0\leq t \leq b \\ \gamma\left( \dfrac{t-b}{1-b} \right), & b\leq t \leq 1. \end{cases} $$ Then $\beta$ is continuous, and since $\gamma([0,1])\subseteq B$ and $\beta = \alpha$ up to $t=b$ , we have that $\gamma \in A$ and $y=\operatorname{ev}(\beta)\in \operatorname{ev}(A)$ , which proves that $V\subseteq \operatorname{ev}(A)$ . Hence, $\operatorname{ev}$ is open, and so is $q$ . After further inspecting Lee's proof, it is only neccessary to prove that $[\alpha \cdot U]$ is open when $U$ is a relatively simply connected neighborhood of $\alpha(a)$ , but adding that hypothesis hasn't helped me as of now. EDIT 2: I think I've come up with a proof of the last statement. The main idea is to prove that ""translations by a path"" reduce the study of such sets to just seeing that $[c_{x_{0}}\cdot U]$ is open in $\tilde{X}$ . For any $x\in X$ , let $P(X,x)$ be the space of all paths in $X$ starting at $x$ (equipped with the compact-open topology), and let $Q(X,x)$ be the quotient of $P(X,x)$ by path homotopy, and denote by $\phi_{x}\colon P(X,x)\to Q(X,x)$ the natural map. Notice that $\tilde{X}=Q(X,x_{0})$ . Given $x,y\in X$ , and any path $\gamma$ from $x$ to $y$ , one can define a mapping $\Lambda\colon P(X,y)\to P(X,x)$ given by $\Lambda_{\gamma}(\alpha)=\gamma\cdot \alpha$ . We prove that $\Lambda_{\gamma}$ is a continuous map. Let $\alpha \in P(X,y)$ , and suppose $[K,U]$ is a subbasic set of $P(X,x)$ such that $\Lambda_{\gamma}(\alpha)=\gamma \cdot \alpha \in [K,U]$ . Divide $K$ into $K_{1}=K\cap [0,1/2]$ and $K_{2}=K\cap [1/2,1]$ . Given any $t\in K_{2}$ , we have $\gamma \cdot \alpha(t)=\alpha(2 t -1)\in U$ , so $K_{2}'=\{ 2s-1 \colon s\in K_{2} \}$ is a compact subset of $[0,1]$ such that $\alpha \in [K_{2}',U]$ . Now, given any $\beta\in [K_{2}',U]\subseteq P(X,y)$ , it is clear that $\gamma \cdot \beta (K_{1})=\gamma(K_{1})=\gamma \cdot \alpha(K_{1})\subseteq U$ , and $\gamma \cdot \beta (K_{2})=\beta(K_{2}')\subseteq U$ , so $\Lambda_{\gamma}(\beta)\in [K,U]$ . Therefore, $\Lambda_{\gamma}$ is continuous. Now, since $\Lambda_{\gamma}$ is compatible with both $\phi_{x}$ and $\phi_{y}$ , it passes to the quotient into a continuous map $\Omega_{\gamma}\colon Q(X,y)\to Q(X,x)$ , whose inverse is $\Omega_{\overline{\gamma}}$ , so $\Omega_{\gamma}$ is a homeomorphism. Returning to the question at hand: consider a path $\gamma\in P(X,x_{0})$ , and a relatively simply connected open set $U\subseteq X$ containing $\gamma(1)=x$ . Then: $$ [\gamma \cdot U]=\{[\gamma\cdot \alpha]\colon \alpha \text{ is a path in } U \text{ such that } \alpha(0)=\gamma(1)=x\} \\ =\{\Omega_{\gamma}([\alpha])\colon \alpha \text{ is a path in } U \text{ such that } \alpha(0)=\gamma(1)=x\}=\Omega_{\gamma}(\phi_{x}([[0,1],U])), $$ So it suffices to prove that $\phi_{x}([[0,1],U])$ is open in $Q(X,x)$ , that is, $\phi^{-1}_{x}(\phi_{x}([[0,1],U]))$ is open in $P(X,x)$ .I have yet to prove this last bit, but I think it should be possible to conclude from here.","Recently I've been self-studying the theory of covering spaces from ""Introduction to Topological Manifolds"", by John M.

We define to be the map . We later define a topology on by means of a basis, which turns into a simply connected, locally path connected space and into a covering map. However, some authors suggest that an alternative way to construct is to give the compact-open topology (that is, the subspace topology it inherits as a subset of ), and the quotient topology induced by the canonical map . Nevertheless, I haven't been able to find a clear proof that is the universal cover of . What I'm trying to do is imitate the proof in Lee's book, but using this alternative topology: most of the details of the proof are rather set-theoretic, so I've managed to reduce the problem of rewriting the proof to just having to prove these 4 facts: is a path connected topological space. is continuous. is open. For every and every open set such that , the subset is open in . Here are my ideas so far: is path connected (and hence is too): let be the class of the constant path at and be arbitrary. Define by . This is a continuous map, so by properties of the CO-topology, the map given by is continuous. Since , and , is a path in from to . Therefore, is path-connected. Let be the map defined by . This map is continuous (again, this is a general property of the CO-topology) and passes continuously to the quotient, inducing precisely the map , so is continuous. As of openness of , I'm not sure how to proceed: what I'm sure of is that, if is an open map (which I think it is), then is too. I believe that it should be possible to prove that basic open subsets of are mapped into open sets of . Let defined as above, we need to see that is open in . Take any , so that , where is a path in starting at . Let be the path component of which contains (and therefore, it contains ). Then , where is the basic open subset of given by all paths which end at some point of . From here I don't know how to continue: I think this open set is contained in , but I haven't got an idea to prove it (certainly, since we know ""a posteriori"" that is simply connected, every element of is homotopic to , where is a path in from to the endpoint of such element). So far, are my ideas on the right track? Can someone help me especially with the last two statements? Thank you in advance! EDIT 1: I wanted to add some new insights on the proof of the last two statements: I think this could be a valid proof for openness of : let be a basic open set of , we need to prove that is an open subset of . Take , so that there exists some such that . Let be the intersection of all 's such that (if none of the contains , then ), so , and let be the path component of that contains (so is open in ). I claim that . To see this, let . For every such that , let , and let . By continuity, one can choose some such that . Take any path in from to and define Then is continuous, and since and up to , we have that and , which proves that . Hence, is open, and so is . After further inspecting Lee's proof, it is only neccessary to prove that is open when is a relatively simply connected neighborhood of , but adding that hypothesis hasn't helped me as of now. EDIT 2: I think I've come up with a proof of the last statement. The main idea is to prove that ""translations by a path"" reduce the study of such sets to just seeing that is open in . For any , let be the space of all paths in starting at (equipped with the compact-open topology), and let be the quotient of by path homotopy, and denote by the natural map. Notice that . Given , and any path from to , one can define a mapping given by . We prove that is a continuous map. Let , and suppose is a subbasic set of such that . Divide into and . Given any , we have , so is a compact subset of such that . Now, given any , it is clear that , and , so . Therefore, is continuous. Now, since is compatible with both and , it passes to the quotient into a continuous map , whose inverse is , so is a homeomorphism. Returning to the question at hand: consider a path , and a relatively simply connected open set containing . Then: So it suffices to prove that is open in , that is, is open in .I have yet to prove this last bit, but I think it should be possible to conclude from here.","X x_{0}\in X P(X,x_{0}) X x_{0} \tilde{X} P(X,x_{0}) \alpha \sim \beta \alpha(1)=\beta(1) \alpha\simeq \beta q\colon \tilde{X}\to X q([\alpha]):=\alpha(1) \tilde{X} \tilde{X} q \tilde{X} P(X,x_{0}) \mathcal{C}([0,1],X) \tilde{X} \pi \colon P(X,x_{0})\to \tilde{X} q\colon \tilde{X}\to X X \tilde{X} q\colon \tilde{X}\to X q\colon \tilde{X}\to X \alpha \in P(X,x_{0}) U\subseteq X \alpha(1)\in U

If $f : A \to B$ is a homeomorphism, does $f$ extend to a homeomorphism between $\text{Cl}_X(A)$ and $\text{Cl}_Y(B)$, i.e does there exist a $g : Cl_X(A) \to Cl_Y(B)$, such that $g|_{A} = f$.

Well I have to consider $z\in Z$ and show that there exist a neighborhood that is evenly covered by $p$, I know that there exist a neighborhood $U$ that is evenly covered by $r$, I think that this will be the desired neighborhood. First of all $ r^{-1}(U) = \cup_{i=1}^{n}  V_i $ (it's easy to see that the unions is finite using the fact that the fibres are finite and this is a local homeomorphism between the $V_i$) Then $ p^{-1}(U)=q^{-1} (r^{-1}(U) ) = q^{-1}(\cup_{i=1}^{n}  V_i)=\cup_{i=1}^{n}  q^{-1}(V_i) $ With $ q^{-1}(V_i) \cong V_i$ under $q$ and so $\cong$ U under $p$ I never used the fact that the preimage is finite, so my proof is obviously not correct, please help me with this","This problem was posted before, but not the proof (because the asker knowed the answer), only a counterexample without the hypothesis of finite fibres.
