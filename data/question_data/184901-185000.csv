Problem, part of Exercise 3.4.5 Tao's Analysis I 4th Ed. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a function from one set $X$ to another set $Y$ . Show $f^{-1}(f(S))=S$ for every $S \subseteq X$ if and only if $f$ is injective. Because I want to isolate the root cause of any misunderstanding, I will write the solution in small steps. Strategy We need to prove both: Part 1: $f^{-1}(f(S))=S \implies f$ is injective. Part 2: $f$ is injective $\implies f^{-1}(f(S)) = S$ . Part 1 Let's start with $f^{-1}(f(S))=S \implies f$ is injective. This is a statement of the form $A \implies B$ , which we'll prove by showing the logically equivalent $\neg B \implies \neg A$ . So, let's consider $f$ is not injective. This means there could be an $x \in S$ and an $x' \in X \setminus S$ such that $f(x)=f(x')$ . Question 1: Is this a valid argument to start with? We could have $x \in S$ and $x' \in S$ such that $x \neq x$ but $f(x)=f(x')$ . The inverse image $f^{-1}(f(S))$ is, by definition, the set $\{x \in X: f(x) \in f(S)\}$ . Using our definitions of $x$ and $x'$ , both qualify to be in this set as $f(x')=f(x) \in f(S)$ . However $x' \notin S$ , which tells us $f^{-1}(f(S)) \neq S$ . Therefore, $f$ not injective implies $f^{-1}(f(S)) \neq S$ . This is logically equivalent to $f(f^{-1}(S))=S \implies f$ is injective. Question 2: Even if this prove by contradiction is correct, is the the simplest way? Part 2 Now let's show $f$ is injective $\implies f^{-1}(f(S))=S$ . To do this we need to show that under the assumption $f$ is injective, both of the following are true: $S \subseteq f^{-1}(f(S))$ $f^{-1}(f(S)) \subseteq S$ Let's start with the first $S \subseteq f^{-1}(f(S))$ . If $x \in S$ , then $f(x) \in f(S)$ .  By definition of inverse images, the set $f^{-1}(f(S))$ is $\{x \in X: f(x) \in f(S)\}$ . Therefore $x$ is in this set, because it meets the membership criteria, $f(x) \in f(S)$ . So we have $x \in S \implies x \in f^{-1}(f(S))$ . This is equivalent to $S \subseteq f^{-1}(f(S))$ . Note we didn't need injectivity to show this. Question 3: Is this correct that we didn't need injectivity? Comment I am least sure of the following. Now let's consider $f^{-1}(f(S)) \subseteq S$ . Consider an $x \in X$ that is a member of $f^{-1}(f(S))$ . By definition of inverse images, this means $f(x) \in f(S)$ . Every $y \in f(S)$ has an $s \in S$ such that $f(s) = y$ . Question 4: I think this is wrong. This looks like surjectivity which is not relevant to this problem. Suppose there is another $x' \in X \setminus S$ that is a member of $f^{-1}(f(S))$ . That would require $f(x') \in f(S)$ . This means there is a $y \in f(S)$ where $f(x) =y$ and $f(x')=y$ . This contradicts the injectivity of $f$ . There can only be one $x \in X$ that maps to a given $y \in f(S)$ and since we know $s \in S$ is such that $f(s) \in f(S)$ , then that $x$ must be in $S$ . Hence $f^{-1}(f(S)) \subseteq S$ .","Closed . This question needs details or clarity . It is not currently accepting answers. Want to improve this question?

61,How do we treat degenerate preimages (functions with empty domain & codomains)?,How do we treat degenerate preimages (functions with empty domain & codomains)?,,"I am quite familiar with preimages, however, I have recently been taking a course on Set Theory and came across questions that involve preimages of functions with empty domains (and sometimes empty codomains too). I was wondering how we treat these particular cases and whether or not there is a particular convention when it comes to dealing with these particular problems. To make this more concrete, here is one of the questions that I have come across that prompted me to post my question: For the (unique) function $f: \emptyset \rightarrow$ { $\emptyset$ }, explicitely find the preimage $f^{-1} :$ { $\emptyset$ , { $\emptyset$ }} $\rightarrow$ { $\emptyset$ } My thoughts here were that { $\emptyset$ } $\mapsto \emptyset$ since there are no elements in the domain of $f$ and so this means that there are no elements that can possibly map to { $\emptyset$ }. I also believe that $\emptyset \mapsto \emptyset$ . I am less confident about this. I am looking for the elements of the domain of $f$ that map to nothing. On the one hand, the domain is empty so there is nothing that can possibly map to anything. However, since we are asking what elements of the domain map to nothing, it also feels like the entire domain maps to nothing which makes me think it might instead map the empty set to { $\emptyset$ }. Although perhaps I am overthinking it here. I would be grateful for any clarification.","I am quite familiar with preimages, however, I have recently been taking a course on Set Theory and came across questions that involve preimages of functions with empty domains (and sometimes empty codomains too).

I want to understand where the line is, and get some pointers. ’Self evident’ example For example: The surjective property of a map between a subgroup $H$ and a left Coset $aH$ is seen as self-evident. Map $H \to aH, F(h) = ah$ “Take $x \in aH$ , then $x = ah$ , for some $h \in H$ by definition. So we have $F(h) = x$ thus our map is surjective.” Question : I appreciate this does seem obvious, but can anyone show me any subtle changes that might seem right, but would make this answer actually wrong. I.e. when the answer is so simple, I feel like even the smallest change would throw it off. Non self evident example $$F(x) = x^2 + 1$$ Here we actually have to find the inverse, so that we can show that always, $f(f^{-1}(x))$ gives us our desired $y$ …I.e the ‘ $x$ ’ that always exists such that $f(x) = y$ is $x = (y - 1)^{1/2}$ Then: $f(x) = f\left((y - 1)^{1/2}\right) = y$ [ Edit: Has been kindly noted that this isn't even a valid surjection over the real numbers (which I feel like kind of speaks to my question)...] $x^3 + 1$ should work... Question this error speaks to another problem I have.

Then $\forall C\subseteq A, f^{-1}(f(C))=C$ if and only if $f$ is an injection. Proof. ( $\Rightarrow$ ) Assume $f$ is not an injection. Then $\exists x,y \in A$ such that $f(x)=f(y)$ and $x \ne y$ . We need only to find some subset $C$ of $A$ such that $f^{-1}(f(C)) \ne C$ . Let $C=\{x\} \subseteq A$ . Because $x \ne y, y \notin C$ . Note that $f^{-1}(f(C))=\{a \in A|f(a) \in f(C)\}$ . And that $f(C)=\{b \in B|b=f(x)\}=\{f(x)\}=\{f(y)\}$ , so $y \in f^{-1}(f(C))$ . Since two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements, it follows that $f^{-1}(f(C)) \ne C$ . Thus if $f^{-1}(f(C))=C$ , then $f$ is an injection. ( $\Leftarrow$ ) Suppose $f$ is an injection. Then $\forall x,y \in A, f(x)=f(y) \Rightarrow x=y$ . ( $\subseteq$ ) Let $x \in f^{-1}(f(C))$ . Then $x \in \{a \in A |\exists b \in f(C)$ s.t. $f(a)=b\}$ . Thus $f(x)=b$ for some $b \in f(C)=\{d \in B | \exists y \in C$ s.t. $d=f(y)\}$ . And since $b \in f(C)$ , then $b=f(y)$ for some $y \in C$ . As $b=f(x)$ and $b=f(y)$ , then $f(x)=f(y)$ . Now $f$ is an injection, so $f(x)=f(y) \Rightarrow x=y$ . This means that $x \in C$ , and hence $f^{-1}(f(C)) \subseteq C$ . ( $\supseteq$ ) Let $x \in C$ . Then $f(x) \in f(C)$ , and thus $x \in f^{-1}(f(C))$ . Thus $C \subseteq f^{-1}(f(C))$ . As $f^{-1}(f(C)) \subseteq C$ and $C \subseteq f^{-1}(f(C))$ , then $f^{-1}(f(C))=C$ . Therefore, $f^{-1}(f(C))=C$ if and only if $f$ is an injection. Is this correct?","Claim: Let be a function.
