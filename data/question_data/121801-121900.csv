They did it as following, let $\triangle ABC$ be an isosceles triangle as shown, Since the triangle is isosceles with base and perpendicular equal the opposite angle $\angle C$ and $\angle B$ must be equal . Putting $\angle A=90^\circ$ and using $\angle A + \angle B + \angle C = 180^0$, we get $\angle A= \angle B= 45^\circ$. Now using Pythagoras theorem gives $\sin 45^\circ = \dfrac {1}{\sqrt 2}$. I am satisfied with this explanation. But on https://proofwiki.org they used a square to prove this formula as shown: In that proof over proofwiki they say that the $\angle A$ is $45^\circ$ because the diagonal $AC$ is the bisector of $\angle A$. They do not use the property of isosceles triangle. My questions are, Why is the diagonal of a square bisector of the angle from which it originates? How can we prove this mathematically?

They did it as following, let $\triangle ABC$ be an isosceles triangle as shown, Since the triangle is isosceles with base and perpendicular equal the opposite angle $\angle C$ and $\angle B$ must be equal . Putting $\angle A=90^\circ$ and using $\angle A + \angle B + \angle C = 180^0$, we get $\angle A= \angle B= 45^\circ$. Now using Pythagoras theorem gives $\sin 45^\circ = \dfrac {1}{\sqrt 2}$.

My attempt: From tangency between circles $(1)$ and $(2)$ , it is fairly easy to find the radius of circle $(2)$ , and this also gives its center. For the ellipse, the center has to lie halfway between the top and bottom sides of the square.  What is unknown is the $x$ coordinate of this center ( $C_x$ ).  The points of tangency with the two circles are also unknown, and in addition the semi-major and semi-minor axes of the ellipse and the angle of rotation of the major axis from the standard orientation along the $x$ axis is also unknown.  Using parametric equations for the two circles, we need two parameters $t_1$ and $t_2$ (unknown) to describe the two tangency points with the ellipse.
