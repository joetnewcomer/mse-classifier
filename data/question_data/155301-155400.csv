Below is a plot of a Bessel function of the second kind , for illustrative purposes: given by $$ Y_0(z)=\dfrac{2}{\pi}\bigg(\bigg(\log(z/2)+\gamma\bigg)\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\dfrac{(-1)^m}{m!\ \Gamma(m+1)}(z/2)^{2m}+\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{k+1}\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\dfrac{1}{i}\bigg(\dfrac{(z^2/4)^k}{(k!)^2}\bigg)\bigg) $$ Whether it is the case or not, I would be interested to know why it follows this pattern. The periodicity up to $y$ follows a particular type of randomness, seen also in the differences between zeta zeros, for example. I am curious to find out whether there is any connection.

But how has this got anything to do with prime ideals, and why is it not sufficient to just consider normal 'non-Archimedean' primes. And why can't you fully understand ramification this way?",k \to R k \to C,"['number-theory', 'algebraic-number-theory', 'maximal-and-prime-ideals', 'galois-extensions', 'ramification']"

52,"The hunting of ""missing primes""","The hunting of ""missing primes""",,"First, I would like to introduce a peculiar way to display the prime numbers (greater than $9$ ) by means of the ten they belong to ( $x$ -axis), and their ending digit ( $y$ -axis). Here's an example of such layout, reporting the first $25$ primes. (You might be interested in the following conjecture , which is based on this two-dimensional representation of prime numbers). We can now organize the primes (except $17, 19,29$ ) in a series of parallelograms, defined by four points corresponding to the four integers $N+1$ , $N+11$ , $N+49$ , and $N+59$ , where $N=0,3,6, 9\ldots$ denotes an increasing number of tens ( $N$ -parallelogram). As it was conjectured (and then shown) in this post , on the edge of each of these parallelograms, we can find at most $7$ primes . The red crosses in the picture below indicate the ""missing primes"" for each $N$ -parallelogram, i.e. the integers that lie on the $N$ -parallelogram (in one of the eight positions in which we could locate a prime), but that are not prime numbers. Now, we can easily see that the missing primes divisible by $7$ are located in a well defined position on each $N$ -parallelogram, as one can easily verify in the following scheme: Each gray segment, indeed, connects four missing primes divisible by $7$ .   For instance, the first segment from the left connects $49, 77, 133, 161$ . Similarly, we can recognize the missing primes divisible by $17$ in correspondence of the green segments in the following picture (again, four missing primes for each segment). For instance, the first segment from the left connects the missing primes $119, 187, 323, 391$ . It is clear that this scheme can be generalized, always yielding to a neatly organized structure (somehow cylindrical) of missing primes. Exactly here comes my question. Given $N$ , is there an elementary way to determine the exact number of missing primes, and their position, on the $N$ -parallelogram? I tried to use the interesting comments and the clever answers related to this post and also to this one , but I could not go far. Therefore, I will be very thankful for any suggestion.

In order to show where I’m coming from, let me present this as a combination of a draft followed by a critique. Draft Observe that the set of polynomials with non-negative integer coefficients maps bijectively with the set of integers $\ge 2$ in a natural way, namely, that given such a polynomial, whose coefficients are a(n), … a(1), a(0), the corresponding integer is the one such that the exponent of the k-th prime in its canonical prime factorization (ie, the primes occurring in ascending sequence) is a(k-1). For example, if the coefficients are 2, 0, 1, 3, then the corresponding integer is 49 x 3 x 8 = 2976.

Does this movie show any striking visual pattern? Or perhaps the n-th frame should consist not simply of the graph of the polynomials for (n + 1), but of the sum of the first n such polynomials. Anyway, does the movie show any striking visual pattern? Critique In the draft, we ignored the issue of what the (algebraic) sign of a given coefficient should be, simply assuming that they should all be non-negative. However, bearing in mind the example of the determinant (of a square matrix), in which negative signs are alternately assigned, perhaps we should specify that, say, the coefficients of the terms of odd index be negative. Many such schemes of specifying negative coefficients are possible. Indeed, there are infinitely many possible schemes, because the scheme might not be independent of the degree of the polynomial. So, the question is, which scheme is best, in terms of generating a visual pattern when the movie is played? If we don’t know, we could pick some promising/plausible ones and then just run them and see which gives the best results.

Solutions In a previous post, On sums of three cubes of form $a^3+b^3+c^3=(c+1)^3$ , an example of which is the well-known, $$3^3+4^3+5^3=6^3$$ we asked if there were polynomial parameterizations higher than 3rd degree . The answer was in the affirmative . In this new question, we ask if more ""triplet parameterizations"" can be found. These ""triplets"" will be described below. First, the equation $a^3+b^3+c^3=(c+1)^3$ can be solved as a quadratic in $c$ , namely, $$c =  \frac{-3+\sqrt{12(a^3+b^3)-3}}6$$ Hence the condition is akin to an elliptic curve, $$P(a,b):=12(a^3+b^3)-3 = y^2$$ but is to be solved by integer polynomials. Ten solutions have been found so far, the first three being, $$a_1 = n,\quad b_1 = 3n^2+2n+1$$ $$a_{2,3} = 3n^2, \quad b_{2,3} = 6n^2\pm3n+1\quad$$ The next three found by Old Peter and based on, $$(\color{blue}{9n^3})^3 + (\color{blue}{-9n^3 + 9n^2 - 3n + 1})^3 + (27n^4 - 18n^3 + 9n^2 - 3n)^3 = (27n^4 - 18n^3 + 9n^2 - 3n + 1)^3$$ thus the first triplet , \begin{align} a_4 = 9n^3,\quad  &b_4 = -9n^3 + 9n^2 - 3n + 1\\[6pt] a_5 = \color{blue}{9n^3},\quad  &b_5 = 27n^4 + 18n^3 + 9n^2 + 3n + 1\quad\\[6pt] a_6 = \color{blue}{9n^3 + 9n^2 + 3n + 1},  \quad &b_6 = 27n^4 + 18n^3 + 9n^2 + 3n \end{align} The latter two will yield different $a^3+b^3+c^3=(c+1)^3$ where all terms are positive for $n>0$ .  For example, let the triplet $a_k,b_k$ as defined and $c_k =  \frac16\left(-3+\sqrt{12(a^3+b^3)-3}\right)$ , then for $n=1$ , $$9^3 - 2^3 + 15^3 = 16^3\\ 9^3 + 58^3 + 255^3 = 256^3\\  22^3 + 57^3 + 255^3 = 256^3$$ I don't know why a parameterization for $u_1^3+u_2^3 = u_3^3+u_4^3$ will yield a pair for $v_1^3+v_2^3+v_3^3=v_4^3,$ with all the terms $(u_i, v_i)$ positive for $n>0.$ The next three were found by yours truly and based on, $$(\color{red}{9n^3 + 6n^2 + 1})^3 + (\color{red}{-9n^3 + 3n^2 - 3n})^3 + (27n^4 + 6n^2)^3 = (27n^4 +  6n^2 + 1)^3$$ thus the second triplet , \begin{align} a_7 = 9n^3 + 6n^2 + 1,\quad  &b_7 = -9n^3 + 3n^2 - 3n\\[6pt] \quad a_8 = \color{red}{9n^3 + 6n^2 + 1},\quad  &b_8 = 27n^4 + 18n^3 + 3n^2 + 3n\\[6pt] a_9 = \color{red}{9n^3 + 3n^2 + 3n},  \quad &b_9 = 27n^4 + 18n^3 + 15n^2 + 3n + 1 \end{align} Again, the latter two will yield all terms positive for $n>0$ . For example, let $n=1$ , $$16^3 - 9^3 + 33^3 = 34^3\\ 16^3 + 51^3 + 213^3 = 214^3\\ 15^3 + 64^3 + 297^3 = 298^3$$ And the 10th by Adam Bailey, $$a_{10} = (3n + 1)(9n^3 + 15n^2 + 10n + 3),\quad b_{10} = (3n + 1)^2(6n^2 + 5n + 3) + 1\qquad $$ II. Addendum There is a curious connection to Ramanujan's work. The two triplets are related by, $$a_4+b_4 = a_7+b_7 = \color{magenta}{9n^2 - 3n + 1}$$ a polynomial which is quite important to "" real cubic fields "". The discriminant $d$ of, $$x^3 + x^2 - (3 n^2 + n)x + n^3=0$$ is $d=-n^2(\color{magenta}{9n^2+3n+1})^2$ . Since it is a negative square, the cubic always has three real roots $x_i$ . Then we have Ramanujan's nice identity , $$x_1^{1/3}+x_2^{1/3}+x_3^{1/3} = \sqrt[3]{-(6n+1)+3\sqrt[3]{n(9n^2+3n+1)}}$$ For $n=-1$ , we recover his well-known, $$\sqrt[3]{\cos\tfrac{2\pi}7}+\sqrt[3]{\cos\tfrac{4\pi}7}+\sqrt[3]{\cos\tfrac{8\pi}7}=\sqrt[3]{\tfrac{5-3\,\sqrt[3]7}2}$$ III.

99,Prime values of $\sum_{j=1}^n j^k$,Prime values of,\sum_{j=1}^n j^k,"Today somebody has asked the following: Can the number $S_{n,k}=\sum_{j=1}^n j^k$ be prime for positive integers $n,k$ ? I don't know the reason, but the question was deleted few minutes after. I don't remember her/his username. I find the question interesting enough to ask it again. I have some results as well. The case $n=1$ is trivial. The case $n=2$ gives some examples, namely Fermat primes. So we assume from now that $n\ge 3$ . (The original problem put this as a condition). If $n$ is a power of two, the sum has $n/2$ odd numbers, and $n/2$ is even, so the sum is even, and, obviously, greater than $2$ , so $S_{2^r\!,k}$ is composite. If $n$ has an odd prime divisor $p$ and $k$ is not a multiple of $p-1$ , the numbers $$1^k, 2^k,\ldots,(p-1)^k$$ are exactly the roots of the polynomial $$X^{(p-1)/d}-1\in\Bbb Z_p[X]$$ where $d=\gcd(p-1,k)$ , counted $d$ times each, so their sum is $0$ . Since $n$ is a multiple of $p$ , this sum is repeated $n/p$ times, so it is $0$ $\pmod p$ also. In other words: If $p$ is an odd prime divisor of $n$ and $k$ is not a multiple of $p-1$ , then $p\mid S_{n,k}$ What happens if $n$ has no such divisor? Well, I have also obtained a few facts. If $n\equiv 3\pmod 4$ , then the sum contains $(n+1)/2$ odd terms, so it is even. If $n$ is a prime $p$ , $2p+1$ is also prime and $k=p-1$ , the numbers $$1^{p-1},2^{p-1},\ldots,p^{p-1}$$ are the roots of the polynomial $$X^p-1\in\Bbb Z_{2p+1}[X]$$ so again, their sum is $0\pmod {2p+1}$ . That is: If $p$ is prime and $2p+1$ is prime, then $2p+1\mid S_{p,p-1}$ Of course, there are many not covered cases.","Today somebody has asked the following: Can the number be prime for positive integers ? I don't know the reason, but the question was deleted few minutes after. I don't remember her/his username. I find the question interesting enough to ask it again. I have some results as well. The case is trivial. The case gives some examples, namely Fermat primes. So we assume from now that . (The original problem put this as a condition). If is a power of two, the sum has odd numbers, and is even, so the sum is even, and, obviously, greater than , so is composite. If has an odd prime divisor and is not a multiple of , the numbers are exactly the roots of the polynomial where , counted times each, so their sum is . Since is a multiple of , this sum is repeated times, so it is also. In other words: If is an odd prime divisor of and is not a multiple of , then What happens if has no such divisor? Well, I have also obtained a few facts. If , then the sum contains odd terms, so it is even. If is a prime , is also prime and , the numbers are the roots of the polynomial so again, their sum is . That is: If is prime and is prime, then Of course, there are many not covered cases.","S_{n,k}=\sum_{j=1}^n j^k n,k n=1 n=2 n\ge 3 n n/2 n/2 2 S_{2^r\!,k} n p k p-1 1^k, 2^k,\ldots,(p-1)^k X^{(p-1)/d}-1\in\Bbb Z_p[X] d=\gcd(p-1,k) d 0 n p n/p 0 \pmod p p n k p-1 p\mid S_{n,k} n n\equiv 3\pmod 4 (n+1)/2 n p 2p+1 k=p-1 1^{p-1},2^{p-1},\ldots,p^{p-1} X^p-1\in\Bbb Z_{2p+1}[X] 0\pmod {2p+1} p 2p+1 2p+1\mid S_{p,p-1}","['number-theory', 'elementary-number-theory', 'prime-numbers', 'divisibility']"
