First, I have: $$f \sim g \,  \Leftrightarrow \,x_0 \in \mathbb{R^n}, \exists \,U \ni x_0\,\mid f|_U = g|_U$$ (A) Reflexivity: $f \sim f \Rightarrow$ for $x_0 \in \mathbb{R^n}, \exists \,U \ni x_0\,\mid f|_U = f|_U$ (B)Symmetry:  If $f \sim g$ then $g \sim f$ $\Rightarrow$ for $x_0 \in \mathbb{R^n}, \exists \,U \ni x_0\,\mid f|_U = g|_U$ and $g|_U = f|_U$ (C)Transitivity: If $f \sim g$ and $g \sim h$, then $f \sim h \Rightarrow $ for $ x_0 \in \mathbb{R^n}, \exists \,U,V \ni x_0\,\mid f|_U = g|_U$ and $\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,g|_V = h|_V,$ therefore $f|_{U \cap V} = h|_{U \cap V}$, so $f \sim h$ Now, the equivalence class are defined as follows:  $$[f]= \{\varphi \in C_{x_0}\ | \varphi \sim f\} \Rightarrow \varphi|_U = f|_U $$ $$[g]= \{\pi \in C_{x_0}\ | \pi \sim g\}  \Rightarrow \pi|_V = g|_V$$ They are welldefined, lets suppose that $[f]=[\phi]$ and $[g]=[\psi]$, then we say that:$[f]+[g] = [\phi]+[\psi] $ and $[f][g]=[\phi][\psi] $. Now by definition,for $x_0 \in \mathbb{R^n}, \exists \,U \ni x_0\, ,f|_U = \phi|_U$ and $\exists \, V \ni x_0\ ,g|_V = \psi|_V $, this implies that:$$(f+g)|_{U \cap V} = (\phi+\psi)|_{U \cap V} \Rightarrow [f + g] = [\phi + \psi],$$ $$(f g)|_{U \cap V} = (\phi \psi)|_{U \cap V} \Rightarrow [f  g] = [\phi  \psi]$$ So they are well defined.On the other hand, I have: $$\phi:C_{x_0} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}, \phi[f]=f(x_0) $$ So the kernel of $\phi$ is $M_{x_0}$, so by the first isomorphism theorem, we have that: $$ C_{x_0}/M_{x_0} \cong \mathbb{R} $$Now, $\mathbb{R}$ is a field, therefore $C_{x_0}/M_{x_0} $ is a field $\Rightarrow$ $M_{x_0}$ is maximal. To prove that $M_{x_0}$ is the unique maximal, first we notice that $M_{x_0}$ contains no units, so if $f \notin M_{x_0}.$ Then $f(x_0) \neq 0 \Rightarrow \exists \, U \ni x_0$ such that $f(y) \neq 0, \forall y \in U \Rightarrow 1/f$ exists in a neighborhood of $x_0, \, \Rightarrow 1/f$ is a unit in $C_{x_0} \Rightarrow C_{x_0}$ is a $\mathbf{local \,ring}$, so $M_{x_0}$ is the unique maximal by the characterization of $\mathbf{local\, rings}$ Now to prove that $M_{x_0}$ is finitely generated, We have: $$ h(1) - h(0) = \int^1_0 h'(s)\,ds$$ where $f(x_0)=0 $ in $M_{x_0}$ and $h(s) = f(s(x-x_0) +x_0)$. On the other hand, $$h'(s) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i} \frac{\partial x_i}{\partial s}, $$  but $\frac{\partial x_i}{\partial s} = (x_i - x_0^{i}),$ this is true because for $s \in \mathbb{R}$ and notice that $h:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, therefore $(s(x-x_0) +x_0) \in \mathbb{R} \Rightarrow (s(x_i-x_0^{i}) +x_0) \in \mathbb{R^n} $. Now, $h(1) = f(x)$ and $ h(0) = f(x_0)=0$. Hence: $$f(x) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n (x_i-x_0^{i})\cdot(\int^1_0 \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}\,ds),$$ Now, since the integral $\int^1_0 \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}\,ds$ depends on the variable $s$, we thus have that the generators of $M_{x_0}$ are $(x_i-x_0^{i})$. In other words, $$M_{x_0} = \langle x_1-x_0^{1},x_2-x_0^{2}, \cdots, x_n-x_0^{n}\rangle$$ Now im not sure about a few thing: 1) this is the right proof for the equivalence relation ${\bf Done}$ 2) I don't understand how to proof that they are well defined ${\bf Done}$ 3) $C_{x_0}/M_{x_0} $ is a field, then $M_{x_0} $ is maximal, this prove that is the unique one. ${\bf Done}$ 4) Is the procedure in $M_{x_0}$ is finitely generated clear or I need some other stuff, my professor told me that the functions in the exercise are smooth too","Hello Everyone, I have this homework problem, I'm going to share what i have so far, not sure if Im in the right path.

2,Show that $S^n\cong\mathbb{R}^n\cup\{\infty\}.$,Show that,S^n\cong\mathbb{R}^n\cup\{\infty\}.,"The problem statement is: Show that $S^n\cong\mathbb{R}^n\cup\{\infty\}.$ My attempt at the proof is as follows: Let $f:S^n\to\mathbb{R}^n\cup\{\infty\}$ be defined as $f(x)=h(x)$ for $x\neq p$ and $f(x)=\infty$ for $x=p$, where $h$ is the homeomorphism between $S^n-\{p\}$ and $\mathbb{R}^n$. Since $h$ is bijective, $f(p)=\infty$ and $f^{-1}(\{\infty\})=p$, it's clear that $f$ too is bijective. We must show that $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are continuous. To begin, let $O\subset\mathbb{R}^n\cup\{\infty\}$ be open. Then $O\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ or $O=K^c\cup\{\infty\}$ for some compact $K\subset\mathbb{R}^n$. If $O\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ then $f^{-1}(O)=h^{-1}(O)$, which we know is open since $h$ is continuous. Now, if $O=K^c\cup\{\infty\}$ then we have $f^{-1}(O)=f^{-1}(K^c\cup\{\infty\})=f^{-1}(K^c)\cup f^{-1}(\{\infty\})=(f^{-1}(K))^c\cup\{p\}=(h^{-1}(K))^c\cup\{p\}.$ This is where I get stuck in the proof. What I want to say is since $h:S^n-\{p\}\to\mathbb{R}^n$, $(h^{-1}(K))^c\subset S^n-\{p\}$ and so we really have $S^n-h^{-1}(K)$, which is open because $h^{-1}(K)$ is compact, more specifically closed and bounded, since $K$ is compact and $h^{-1}$ is continuous. Afterword, I figure showing  $\,f^{-1}$ is continuous will be a similar argument. Another approach I wanted to take was to consider $S^n-\{p\}\cong\mathbb{R}^n$. Then since the one point compactification preserves homeomorphisms between sets, we must have $S^n-\{p\}\cup\{p\}=S^n\cong\mathbb{R}^n\cup\{\infty\}.$ In the text I'm reading, the one point compactification adds $\infty$, to add a different point, do we need to only confirm that $S^n-\{p\}$ is a locally compact Hausdorff space?

7,The First Homology Group Obtained by Attaching a Möbius Strip to a Torus in a Certain Way.,The First Homology Group Obtained by Attaching a Möbius Strip to a Torus in a Certain Way.,,"Let $ M $ and $ \mathbb{T}^{2} $ denote the Möbius strip and the torus respectively. Suppose that we attach $ M $ to $ \mathbb{T}^{2} $ by wrapping the boundary circle $ C $ of $ M $ around the first circle of the torus $ k $ times, i.e., we have a continuous attaching map $ f: C \to \mathbb{S}^{1} \times \{ 1 \} \subseteq \mathbb{T}^{2} $ with winding number $ k $. Then what would be the first homology group of the resulting adjunction space $ X = M \sqcup_{f} \mathbb{T}^{2} $? Set theoretically, we have $$ X = (M \times \{ 0 \}) \cup (\mathbb{T}^{2} \times \{ 1 \}) \Big/ \sim, $$ where $ \sim $ is the equivalence relation defined by $ (x,0) \sim (f(x),1) $ for all $ x \in M $. Next, consider the following two subspaces of $ X $: $$ A = [M \times \{ 0 \}]_{\sim} \quad \text{and} \quad B = [\mathbb{T}^{2} \times \{ 1 \}]_{\sim}. $$ Their intersection is $ [C \times \{ 0 \}]_{\sim} = [(\mathbb{S}^{1} \times \{ 1 \}) \times \{ 1 \}]_{\sim} $. Pick an open neighborhood $ U $ of $ A $ and an open neighborhood $ V $ of $ B $ such that $ U $ and $ V $ deformation retract onto $ A $ and $ B $ respectively. Then $ U \cap V $ deformation retracts onto $ A \cap B = [C \times \{ 0 \}]_{\sim} $. As $ \{ U,V \} $ is an open cover of $ X $, we can apply the Mayer-Vietoris sequence to it. My problem is figuring out what the mapping $$ \require{AMScd} \begin{CD} {H_{1}}(U \cap V) @>{i_{*} \oplus j_{*}}>> {H_{1}}(U) \oplus {H_{1}}(V) \end{CD} $$ looks like. Deformation retraction reduces this problem to analyzing the mapping $$ \begin{CD} {H_{1}}([C \times \{ 0 \}]_{\sim}) @>{i_{*} \oplus j_{*}}>> {H_{1}}([M \times \{ 0 \}]_{\sim}) \oplus {H_{1}}([\mathbb{T}^{2} \times \{ 1 \}]_{\sim}). \end{CD} $$ My questions are: Is $ [C \times \{ 0 \}]_{\sim} $ homeomorphic to $ \mathbb{S}^{1} $? This is not very straightforward because $ \sim $ collapses sets of $ k $ points in $ C \times \{ 0 \} $ to singletons. In the case $ k = 2 $, I know that the answer is ‘yes’ because $ \sim $ restricted to $ C \times \{ 0 \} $ behaves as if it were identifying antipodal points in $ \mathbb{S}^{1} $, and it is well-known that identifying antipodal points in $ \mathbb{S}^{1} $ produces $ \mathbb{RP}^{1} $, which is homeomorphic to $ \mathbb{S}^{1} $. Suppose that the answer to the above question is ‘yes’ for $ k $ in general. Then how does the homology class of a fundamental cycle $ \gamma $ in $ [C \times \{ 0 \}]_{\sim} $ map to $ {H_{1}}([M \times \{ 0 \}]_{\sim}) $ under $ i_{*} $? I believe that the answer to this is $$ (i_{*})([\gamma]) = \pm 2 \cdot [\text{Generating core loop of $ M $}], $$ where the sign depends on which orientation we are using. Similarly, how does $ [\gamma] $ map to $ {H_{1}}([\mathbb{T}^{2} \times \{ 1 \}]_{\sim}) $ under $ j_{*} $?","Let $ M $ and $ \mathbb{T}^{2} $ denote the Möbius strip and the torus respectively.

Set theoretically, we have $$ X = (M \times \{ 0 \}) \cup (\mathbb{T}^{2} \times \{ 1 \}) \Big/ \sim, $$ where $ \sim $ is the equivalence relation defined by $ (x,0) \sim (f(x),1) $ for all $ x \in M $. Next, consider the following two subspaces of $ X $: $$ A = [M \times \{ 0 \}]_{\sim} \quad \text{and} \quad B = [\mathbb{T}^{2} \times \{ 1 \}]_{\sim}. $$ Their intersection is $ [C \times \{ 0 \}]_{\sim} = [(\mathbb{S}^{1} \times \{ 1 \}) \times \{ 1 \}]_{\sim} $. Pick an open neighborhood $ U $ of $ A $ and an open neighborhood $ V $ of $ B $ such that $ U $ and $ V $ deformation retract onto $ A $ and $ B $ respectively. Then $ U \cap V $ deformation retracts onto $ A \cap B = [C \times \{ 0 \}]_{\sim} $. As $ \{ U,V \} $ is an open cover of $ X $, we can apply the Mayer-Vietoris sequence to it. My problem is figuring out what the mapping $$ \require{AMScd} \begin{CD} {H_{1}}(U \cap V) @>{i_{*} \oplus j_{*}}>> {H_{1}}(U) \oplus {H_{1}}(V) \end{CD} $$ looks like. Deformation retraction reduces this problem to analyzing the mapping $$ \begin{CD} {H_{1}}([C \times \{ 0 \}]_{\sim}) @>{i_{*} \oplus j_{*}}>> {H_{1}}([M \times \{ 0 \}]_{\sim}) \oplus {H_{1}}([\mathbb{T}^{2} \times \{ 1 \}]_{\sim}). \end{CD} $$ My questions are: Is $ [C \times \{ 0 \}]_{\sim} $ homeomorphic to $ \mathbb{S}^{1} $? This is not very straightforward because $ \sim $ collapses sets of $ k $ points in $ C \times \{ 0 \} $ to singletons. In the case $ k = 2 $, I know that the answer is ‘yes’ because $ \sim $ restricted to $ C \times \{ 0 \} $ behaves as if it were identifying antipodal points in $ \mathbb{S}^{1} $, and it is well-known that identifying antipodal points in $ \mathbb{S}^{1} $ produces $ \mathbb{RP}^{1} $, which is homeomorphic to $ \mathbb{S}^{1} $. Suppose that the answer to the above question is ‘yes’ for $ k $ in general. Then how does the homology class of a fundamental cycle $ \gamma $ in $ [C \times \{ 0 \}]_{\sim} $ map to $ {H_{1}}([M \times \{ 0 \}]_{\sim}) $ under $ i_{*} $? I believe that the answer to this is $$ (i_{*})([\gamma]) = \pm 2 \cdot [\text{Generating core loop of $ M $}], $$ where the sign depends on which orientation we are using. Similarly, how does $ [\gamma] $ map to $ {H_{1}}([\mathbb{T}^{2} \times \{ 1 \}]_{\sim}) $ under $ j_{*} $?",,"['general-topology', 'algebraic-topology', 'homology-cohomology', 'quotient-spaces']"

It is easy to see that in the case of 1-dimensional affine space $\mathbb{C}$ the Zariski-closed sets are $\emptyset, \mathbb{C}$ and all the finite sets $\{ z_1,...,z_k \}$ (since a polynomial has only a finite number of roots).

Problem: A subspace of a regular space is regular; $X \times Y$ is regular iff each of $X$ and $Y$ is regular. So, the first part I think I figure out. A Subspace of a regular space is regular. Proof: Let $Y$ be a subspace of a regular space $X$ and let $x \in Y$ and $F$ be a closed set in $Y$ not containing $x$.  Since $Cl_{X}(F) \cap Y = F$ then $x \notin Cl_{X}(F)$.

I feel like it should follow straight forward from the definition of a regular space and work out component wise on $X \times Y$, but at the same time I know how these questions go and that the question wouldn't be phrased how it is if I didn't need to use the fact that a subspace of a regular space is regular.

Here's my attempt though. $X \times Y$ is regular iff each of $X$ and $Y$ is regular. Proof: $\Rightarrow$) Assume $X \times Y$ is regular.  Then $\forall (x,y) \in X \times Y$ and for every closed $(F_{1}, F_{2}) \subset X \times Y$ with $(x,y) \notin (F_{1}, F_{2})$ there exists disjoint open sets $(U_{1}, U_{2}), (V_{1}, V_{2}) $in $ X \times Y$ such that $(x,y) \in (U_{1}, U_{2})$ and $(V_{1}, V_{2}) \subset (F_{1}, F_{2})$.

I now make my question more precise to avoid the counter-example given there. Let $U \subset \mathbb R^2$ be an open, regular (meaning $U$ is the interior of its closure), bounded and simply connected set. In that situation, $U$ has a connected boundary but it is not necessarily given by a simple closed curve. Let $\gamma : [0,1] \rightarrow \partial U$ be a simple curve such that $\gamma(0) \neq \gamma(1)$ and assume that $\gamma((0,1)) \subset \partial U$ is open in the subspace topology. Is $\partial U \setminus \gamma((0,1))$ connected ? One can note that $K = \partial U \setminus \gamma((0,1))$ is compact and $V = \partial U \setminus \gamma([0,1]) \subset K$ is open. Let $C$ be a connected component of $K$ . According to the lemma in that post , if $C \subset V$ , then $C$ is a connected component of $X = \partial U$ , i.e. $C = \partial U$ which is impossible. Hence $C \nsubseteq V$ and  either $\gamma(0) \in C$ , $\gamma(1) \in C$ or $\{\gamma(0),\gamma(1)\} \subset C$ . In the latter case, $C = K$ and $K$ is connected. Otherwise, $K$ is made of two compact, disjoint, connected components $C_0$ and $C_1$ , $\gamma(i) \in C_i$ , $K = C_0 \cup C_1$ . In particular, $\partial U = C_0 \cup C_1 \cup \gamma((0,1))$ . But is such a boundary possible for a regular simply connected set ? I was thinking of using a separation theorem (such as an hyperplane or Zoretti's theorem, cited in my previous post). Another idea was to use the Riemann Mapping Theorem, i.e. use the biholomorphic map $f : U \rightarrow \{|z| < 1\}$ and try to understand the boundary behaviour (a useful reference is Serge Lang, Complex Analysis, Ch.

Furthermore, as illustrated by a counterexample in the comments, we insist that $\lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \omega(\epsilon) =0$ . Suppose that $S \subset \mathbb R^d$ is compact and $f : S \to \mathbb R$ admits a modulus of continuity $\omega$ on $S$ . Does there exist a function $g : \mathbb R^d \to \mathbb R$ such that (a) $g(x) = f(x)$ on $S$ , and (b) $g$ is uniformly continuous on $\mathbb R^d$ with modulus of continuity $\omega$ ? We can possibly relax the modulus of continuity of $g$ to be of the form $C \times \omega$ for any $C>0$ positive, but not more than that. Motivation In order to motivate this question, it helps to look at other extension theorems. Given $f : O \to \mathbb R$ uniformly continuous on an open set $O$ , it admits a unique extension to $\overline{O}$ which is also uniformly continuous. The proof technique is to define $\tilde{f}(x) = \lim_{y \to x, y \in O} f(y)$ and show that this works. Given any $f : S \to \mathbb R$ continuous where $S$ is closed, it admits a continuous extension to $\mathbb R^d$ . This follows directly from the Tietze extension theorem. If we assume that the modulus of continuity has a specific structure, then some results are known. See e.g. the Kirszbraun Theorem for Lipschitz moduli of continuity i.e. $\omega(\epsilon) = C\epsilon$ for some $C>0$ . Here's a nice proof of that result. What makes this particularly difficult to approach is the control of the modulus of continuity of $g$ outside the set $S$ . For example, suppose that we naively try to force $g$ to be constant outside an open set $O$ which contains $S$ , so that its modulus of continuity is controlled on $O^c$ . Certainly we can find a function $g$ such that $g \equiv f$ on $S$ and $g \equiv 0$ on $O$ , by a variation of Tietze's theorem. However, what we can't do using that scheme is control $|g(x)-g(y)|$ in the region between $S$ and $O$ .

Below I deliver some definitions needed to explain my question. Given a surface $\Sigma$ (i.e. a connected second-countable Hausdorff space locally homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^2$ ), a pre-end of $\Sigma$ is a nested sequence $\{U_{n}\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ of connected open subsets of $\Sigma$ with compact boundary such that for all $n\in \mathbb{N}$ , $U_{n+1}\subset U_{n}$ and for every compact $K\subset \Sigma$ there exists $l\in \mathbb{N}$ with the property that $U_{l}\cap K=\emptyset$ . Two pre-ends $\{U_{n}\}$ and $\{V_{n}\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ are equivalent if for any $i\in \mathbb{N}$ there exists $j\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $V_{j}\subset U_{i}$ and vice versa. The set of equivalence classes of pre-ends is denoted by $E(\Sigma)$ and its elements are the ends of $\Sigma$ . A topology is given to $E(\Sigma)$ by specifying a basis as follows: for any open subset $W\subset \Sigma$ whose boundary is compact, a basic open subset of $E(\Sigma)$ is given by $$W^*:=\{[U_{n}]\in E(\Sigma)\hspace{0.1cm}|\hspace{0.1cm}U_{l}\subset W \mbox{ for }l \mbox{ sufficiently large}\}.$$ The corresponfing topological space $E(\Sigma)$ is known as the end space of $\Sigma$ . A surface is said to be planar if all of its compact subsurfaces (possibly with non-empty manifold boundary) are of genus zero. An end $[U_{n}]$ is called planar if there exists $l\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $U_{l}$ is planar (equivalently, if there exists an open subset $W\subset \Sigma$ with compact boundary that is embeddable in $\mathbb{R}^2$ such that $[U_{n}]\in W^*$ ). Analogously, an orientable end can be defined. Equivalently, the end space of $\Sigma$ can be described using proper rays (i.e. continuous maps $\gamma:[0,+\infty)\rightarrow \Sigma$ such that for every compact set $K\subset \Sigma$ , the set $\gamma^{-1}(K)$ is compact as well) as follows: two proper rays $\gamma_{1}$ and $\gamma_{2}$ are equivalent ( $\gamma_{1}\sim \gamma_{2} $ ) if for every compact $K\subset \Sigma$ there exist an $T>0$ such that $\gamma_{1}\big([T,+\infty)\big)$ and $\gamma_{2}\big([T,+\infty)\big)$ lie in the same path component of $\Sigma\setminus K$ . In this setting, the end space of $\Sigma$ is the quotient $$e(\Sigma):=\frac{\{\gamma:[0,+\infty)\rightarrow \Sigma\hspace{0.1cm}|\hspace{0.1cm}\gamma \mbox{ is a proper ray}\}}{\sim},$$ equipped with the topology determined by the following convergence notion (see User's answer below for a description of a basis of such topology): If $end(\gamma)$ is the equivalence class of a proper ray $\gamma:[0,+\infty)\rightarrow \Sigma$ , then a sequence of equivalence classes $\{end(\gamma_{n})\}$ converges to $end(\gamma)$ if for every compact set $K\subset \Sigma$ there exists a sequence of positive numbers $N_{n}$ such that, for $n$ sufficiently large, $\gamma_{n}\big([N_{n},+\infty)\big)$ and $\gamma\big([N_{n},+\infty)\big)$ lie in the same path component of $\Sigma\setminus K$ . The two previous definitions give rise to homeomorphic end spaces. Indeed, on one hand, given a pre-end $\{U_{n}\}$ , we can create a proper ray by picking points $x_n\in U_{n}$ and connecting $x_{n}$ with $x_{n+1}$ using a path entirely contained in $U_n$ . On the other hand, if $\gamma: [0,+\infty)\rightarrow \Sigma$ is a proper ray, we can construct a pre-end $\{U_{n}\}$ for which $\gamma\big([n,n+1]\big)\subset U_{n}$ .

Equivalently, for each saturated closed subset $B$ of $X$ , $f(B)$ is closed in $Y$ .  (Here, saturated = saturated with respect to $f$ , i.e., saturated with respect to the fibers $f^{-1}(y)$ .)

There is a sequence $(x_n)$ in $B$ such that $f(x_n)$ converges to $f(a)$ .  Taking a subsequence if necessary, we can assume that $f(x_n)$ converges monotonically to $f(a)$ .  Without loss of generality, say it's an increasing sequence, and $a<x_1$ . We have $f(x_1)<f(x_n)<f(a)$ , so by the intermediate value theorem there is a $z_n\in[a,x_1]$ such that $f(z_n)=f(x_n)$ .  Since $B$ is saturated, the point $z_n$ also belongs to $B$ .  Thus $(z_n)$ is a bounded sequence in $B$ and by compactness there is a subsequence converging to a point $z\in B$ (because $B$ is closed).  Replacing $(z_n)$ again by that subsequence, we can assume $z_n$ converges to $z$ , and by continuity of $f$ we have $f(z_n)$ converging to $f(z)$ .

73,Morphism of schemes such that the image contains every generic point of an irreducible component,Morphism of schemes such that the image contains every generic point of an irreducible component,,"Let $f: X \rightarrow Y$ be a morphism of schemes.  When the image $f(X)$ is dense in $Y$ , we say that $f$ is dominant. No doubt, dominant morphisms pop up all over the place and have an important role in birational geometry.  But a lot of the time it seems to me like the property we are really interested in is that $f(X)$ contains all the generic points of irreducible components of $Y$ .  See, for example, the stacks project entry on Dominant Morphisms Stacks 01RI , which is entirely devoted to the question of when these properties coincide.  In geometric situations, like when our schemes have finitely many irreducible components, or when our morphisms are quasi-compact, the concepts coincide.

When the image is dense in , we say that is dominant. No doubt, dominant morphisms pop up all over the place and have an important role in birational geometry.

See, for example, the stacks project entry on Dominant Morphisms Stacks 01RI , which is entirely devoted to the question of when these properties coincide.

77,About a result by Hardy-Littlewood-Polya-Blackwell-Stein-Sherman-Cartier on two order operators.,About a result by Hardy-Littlewood-Polya-Blackwell-Stein-Sherman-Cartier on two order operators.,,"I am trying to adapt a result in Phelps : ""Lectures on Choquet's Theorem"" in chapter 15. Let $X$ be a convex subset of a locally convex space $E$ , let $P_1$ denote the set of all regular Borel probability measures on $X$ . We define the following two partial ordering with the hope to show that, under some aditional constraints, they match. Definition : For two non-negative measure $\mu$ and $\nu$ on $X$ , we say that $\mu\preccurlyeq \nu$ if for all bounded convex continuous function $h:X\to\mathbb R$ , $\mu(h)\leq \nu(h)$ . Definition : For two non-negative measure $\mu$ and $\nu$ on $X$ , we say that $\mu\curlyeqprec \nu$ if there is a dilatation $T:x\to T_x$ such that $\nu=\mu T$ (defined on page 93 of the link above). A theorem by Hardy-Littlewood-Polya-Blackwell-Stein-Sherman-Cartier (on page 94) states If $X$ is compact and if $\mu$ and $\nu$ regular Borel probability measures on $X$ then $\mu\preccurlyeq\nu$ if and only if $\mu\curlyeqprec\nu$ . To me it feels like compactness is used only in the second part of the proof when they use a result of Bourbaki on page 96. I am wondering if the proof can be modified to avoid the use of compactness. Here is my proof and saddly I cannot be sure it is correct. The outline of the proof is to show that $A\triangleq\{ (\epsilon_x,\lambda)\in P_1\times P_1 : \epsilon_x\preccurlyeq\lambda \} = \{ (\epsilon_x,\lambda)\in P_1\times P_1 : \epsilon_x\curlyeqprec\lambda \}\triangleq B$ where $\varepsilon_x(A)=\mathbf 1(x\in A)$ for all $x\in X$ and $A\subseteq X$ measurable. Then we show that $C\triangleq\{ (\mu,\nu):\mu\preccurlyeq \nu \}$ and $D\triangleq\{ (\mu,\nu):\mu\curlyeqprec \nu \}$ are respectively the closed convex hulls of $A$ and $B$ which means that $C=D$ . The proof relies on Jensen inequality that gives $\mu\curlyeqprec\nu\Rightarrow\mu\preccurlyeq \nu$ indeed if we have a kernel $T$ such that $\nu=\mu T$ and a convex function $h$ , then for any $x\in X$ , $T_x(h)\geq h(x)$ , averaging over $\mu$ gives that $\nu(h)\geq\mu(h)$ . It also relies on the definition of the upper concave enveloppe of a bounded function $g$ defined for all $x\in X$ as $\bar g(x)=\sup\{ \lambda(g) : \lambda\sim \epsilon_x \}$ (where $\lambda\sim\epsilon_x$ means that $\lambda$ averages to $x$ , i.e. for all affine function $h$ on $X$ , $\lambda(h)=h(x)$ ). This function is concave and such that $g\leq \bar g$ and, as we will show, $\lambda\sim\epsilon_x\Leftrightarrow \epsilon_x\preccurlyeq \lambda\Leftrightarrow\epsilon_x\curlyeqprec \lambda$ which means that $\bar g(x) = \sup\{ \lambda(g) : \epsilon_x\preccurlyeq \lambda \} = \sup\{ \lambda(g) : \epsilon_x\curlyeqprec \lambda \}$ . Jensen inequality gives that $A\supseteq B$ so we prove that $A\subseteq B$ . Suppose that $\epsilon_x\preccurlyeq \lambda$ , then for all $f\in X^*$ , both $f$ and $-f$ are convex hence $f(x)=\varepsilon_x(f)=\lambda(f)$ and so $\lambda$ averages to $x$ therefore $\lambda\sim\epsilon_x$ . The statement $\lambda\sim\epsilon_x\Leftrightarrow \epsilon_x\curlyeqprec \lambda$ is a tautology, hence $A=B$ . The proof of $C$ and $D$ are the closed convex hulls of respectively $A$ and $B$ are very similar and differ only in few steps. in order to show that $C$ is the closed convex hull of $A$ , it is enough to show that for all affine function $L$ on $P_1\times P_1$ such that $L\geq 0$ on $A$ we have $L\geq 0$ on $C$ , this is because the closed onvex hull of a set is the intersection of all half spaces that contains it. without loss of generality we can write for all $(\alpha,\beta)\in P_1\times P_1$ , $L(\alpha,\beta)=\alpha(f)-\beta(g)$ for some function affine functions $f$ and $g$ on $X$ . Assuming that $L\geq 0$ on $A$ means that for all $\epsilon_x\preccurlyeq \lambda$ , we have $f(x)=\epsilon_x(f)\geq \lambda(g)$ . Assume that $\mu\preccurlyeq \nu$ , then $\mu(-\bar g) \leq \nu(-\bar g)$ by concavity of $g$ and so $\mu(\bar g)\geq \nu(\bar g)$ . From $g\leq \bar g$ we get that $\nu(g)\leq \nu(\bar g)$ . Since for any $\epsilon_x\preccurlyeq \lambda$ we have $f(x)\geq \lambda(g)$ , we have $f(x)\geq \sup\{ \lambda(g): \epsilon_x\preccurlyeq \lambda\}=\bar g(x)$ and so we have $\mu(f)\geq\mu(\bar g)\geq \nu(\bar g)\geq \nu(g)$ . This means that $L\geq 0$ on $C$ and shows that the closed convex hull of $A$ is $C$ . To show the closed convex hull of $B$ is $D$ we take a similar approach. Again suppose that $L : (\alpha,\beta)\to \alpha(f)-\beta(g)$ is such that $L\geq 0$ on $B$ , we show $L\geq 0$ on $D$ . For all $\epsilon_x\curlyeqprec\lambda$ , we have $f(x)\geq \lambda(g)$ and so $f(x)\geq \sup\{ \lambda(g) : \epsilon_x\curlyeqprec\lambda \}=\bar g(x)$ which yields $\mu(f)\geq \mu(\bar g)$ . By Jensen inequality, $\mu\curlyeqprec \nu$ implies $\mu\preccurlyeq \nu$ which implies $\mu(\bar g)\geq \nu(\bar g)$ since $\bar g$ is concave. Finally $\nu(g)\leq \nu(\bar g)$ follows again from $g\leq \bar g$ and so $\mu(f)\geq\mu(\bar g)\geq \nu(\bar g)\geq \nu(g)$ . From this we deduce that $D$ is the closed convex hull of $B$ and so $C=D$ . To me this proof feels correct but I can't know that for a fact so any review or comment would be welcome, I can add more detail if needed. It also seems that this proof does not rely on compactness of $X$ and so if this proof is correct the original result can be generalized. I wonder if the compactness we actually need is the weak one, and here we have it, indeed the set of probability measures on $X$ is bounded (with the $\sup$ norm, the norm of the difference between two probability measures is at most $2$ ) and we also have that this set is weakly closed, because it is the intersection of closed half spaces. This means that the set of probability measures on $X$ is weakly compact, this may be true only if $X$ is itself weakly compact, but I don't know where this would make the proof wrong otherwise.","I am trying to adapt a result in Phelps : ""Lectures on Choquet's Theorem"" in chapter 15.

This means that the set of probability measures on is weakly compact, this may be true only if is itself weakly compact, but I don't know where this would make the proof wrong otherwise.","X E P_1 X \mu \nu X \mu\preccurlyeq \nu h:X\to\mathbb R \mu(h)\leq \nu(h) \mu \nu X \mu\curlyeqprec \nu T:x\to T_x \nu=\mu T X \mu \nu X \mu\preccurlyeq\nu \mu\curlyeqprec\nu A\triangleq\{ (\epsilon_x,\lambda)\in P_1\times P_1 : \epsilon_x\preccurlyeq\lambda \} = \{ (\epsilon_x,\lambda)\in P_1\times P_1 : \epsilon_x\curlyeqprec\lambda \}\triangleq B \varepsilon_x(A)=\mathbf 1(x\in A) x\in X A\subseteq X C\triangleq\{ (\mu,\nu):\mu\preccurlyeq \nu \} D\triangleq\{ (\mu,\nu):\mu\curlyeqprec \nu \} A B C=D \mu\curlyeqprec\nu\Rightarrow\mu\preccurlyeq \nu T \nu=\mu T h x\in X T_x(h)\geq h(x) \mu \nu(h)\geq\mu(h) g x\in X \bar g(x)=\sup\{ \lambda(g) : \lambda\sim \epsilon_x \} \lambda\sim\epsilon_x \lambda x h X \lambda(h)=h(x) g\leq \bar g \lambda\sim\epsilon_x\Leftrightarrow \epsilon_x\preccurlyeq \lambda\Leftrightarrow\epsilon_x\curlyeqprec \lambda \bar g(x) = \sup\{ \lambda(g) : \epsilon_x\preccurlyeq \lambda \} = \sup\{ \lambda(g) : \epsilon_x\curlyeqprec \lambda \} A\supseteq B A\subseteq B \epsilon_x\preccurlyeq \lambda f\in X^* f -f f(x)=\varepsilon_x(f)=\lambda(f) \lambda x \lambda\sim\epsilon_x \lambda\sim\epsilon_x\Leftrightarrow \epsilon_x\curlyeqprec \lambda A=B C D A B C A L P_1\times P_1 L\geq 0 A L\geq 0 C (\alpha,\beta)\in P_1\times P_1 L(\alpha,\beta)=\alpha(f)-\beta(g) f g X L\geq 0 A \epsilon_x\preccurlyeq \lambda f(x)=\epsilon_x(f)\geq \lambda(g) \mu\preccurlyeq \nu \mu(-\bar g) \leq \nu(-\bar g) g \mu(\bar g)\geq \nu(\bar g) g\leq \bar g \nu(g)\leq \nu(\bar g) \epsilon_x\preccurlyeq \lambda f(x)\geq \lambda(g) f(x)\geq \sup\{ \lambda(g): \epsilon_x\preccurlyeq \lambda\}=\bar g(x) \mu(f)\geq\mu(\bar g)\geq \nu(\bar g)\geq \nu(g) L\geq 0 C A C B D L : (\alpha,\beta)\to \alpha(f)-\beta(g) L\geq 0 B L\geq 0 D \epsilon_x\curlyeqprec\lambda f(x)\geq \lambda(g) f(x)\geq \sup\{ \lambda(g) : \epsilon_x\curlyeqprec\lambda \}=\bar g(x) \mu(f)\geq \mu(\bar g) \mu\curlyeqprec \nu \mu\preccurlyeq \nu \mu(\bar g)\geq \nu(\bar g) \bar g \nu(g)\leq \nu(\bar g) g\leq \bar g \mu(f)\geq\mu(\bar g)\geq \nu(\bar g)\geq \nu(g) D B C=D X X \sup 2 X X","['general-topology', 'solution-verification', 'convex-analysis', 'representation-theory', 'order-theory']"

In what follows, I define the dimension of a topological space $X$ in accordance with Hartshorne: $$\dim X:= \sup \{n \in \mathbb N : \exists Z_0 \subsetneq \cdots \subsetneq Z_n \text{ s.t. } Z_j \subset X \text{ is closed and irreducible for all }j \in \{0, \cdots , n\}\}$$ Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces and $f$ a homeomorphism from $X$ to $Y$ and let $r:= \dim X$ . Then there exists a chain $$V_0 \subsetneq \cdots \subsetneq V_n$$ of closed irreducible subsets of $X$ . $f$ being a closed map, each of $f(V_0), \cdots , f(V_n)$ must also be closed and clearly $$f(V_0) \subset \cdots \subset f(V_n).$$ Moreover, for each $j \in \{1, \cdots , n\}$ , considering $z_j \in V_j \setminus V_{j-1}$ gives us from the injectivity of $f$ , $f(z_j) \in f(V_j) \setminus f(V_{j-1})$ , so that all the containments mentioned in the above chain are proper. Finally, we note that each $f(V_j)$ is irreducible simply because the image of an irreducible set under a continuous map is also irreducible: indeed for any irreducible closed set $Z$ of $X$ , if $f(Z) = Y_1 \cup Y_2$ for two nonempty proper closed subsets $Y_j$ of $Y$ , then $$Z =  f^{-1}(f(Z)) = f^{-1}(Y_1 \cup Y_2) = f^{-1}(Y_1) \cup f^{-1}(Y_2),$$ with each $f^{-1}(Y_j)$ closed (in $X$ ), non-empty and proper by the continuity, surjectivity and injectivity of $f$ respectively, thereby contradicting the irreducibility of $Z$ . Thus, $\dim Y \geq r = \dim  X$ and the opposite inequality follows by switching the roles of $X$ and $Y$ , since the inverse of a homeomorphism is also a homeomorphism.

88,Is there a continuous one-to-one function from a Luzin space into the reals?,Is there a continuous one-to-one function from a Luzin space into the reals?,,"The definition I am working with is that a topological space is Luzin if it is an uncountable $T_3$ space such that every nowhere dense subset is at most countable. I've been reading the proof of Theorem 6.8 from S. Todorcevic's Partition Problems in Topology: If it is true that every regular hereditarily Lindelof space is hereditarily separable, then there are no Luzin spaces. The proof proceeds by contradiction, assuming there is a Luzin space $X$ and building from it a hereditarily Lindelof space that is not hereditarily separable. Earlier in the book, it is proved that the same hypotheses imply the Suslin Hypothesis, i.e. there are no Suslin trees ( $\omega_1$ -trees with no uncountable chains and no uncountable antichains). At some point in the proof, the author claims that since there are no Suslin trees, in particular, the set of nonempty open sets of $X$ ordered by set-theoretic inclusion is not a Suslin tree. Therefore it is possible to find a continuous function from an uncountable subset $X_0\subseteq X$ into the reals, $f: X_0\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ , such that $f$ is one-to-one. Finding such a function is the very assertion that I am struggling to see. Since there is no reference to previous results or bibliography about this assertion, I believed it is folklore or something very easy to see. However, I have been struggling to find a proof for this. What I have done: First, I found this theorem in K. Kunnen's paper ""Luzin spaces"" http://www.topology.auburn.edu/tp/reprints/v01/tp01021.pdf : Every Luzin ( $T_3$ ) space is zero-dimensional (in the paper, a Luzin space is a $T_2$ topological space such that every nowhere dense subset is countable). Because of this, instead of considering the whole set of nonempty open subsets of $X$ , I rather work with the clopen basis, ordered by inclusion. Secondly, every Luzin space is hereditarily Lindelof, and by our hypothesis, also hereditarily separable. So the clopen basis ordered by inclusion is $ccc$ . Since it is not a Suslin tree, then either it's height as a tree is countable or there is an uncountable chain. If there is an uncountable chain $\{U_\alpha:\alpha<\omega_1\}$ , then $\bigcup\{X\setminus U_\alpha:\alpha<\omega_1\}$ is not hereditarily Lindelof, for the family $\{X\setminus U_\alpha:\alpha<\omega_1\}$ is an open cover with no countable subcovers. Thus, the tree is countable. From this, I tried to build a continuous one-to-one function from the tree $2^{<\omega}$ into the reals, enumerate the countable dense subset of $X$ , $D=\{d_n:n\in \omega\}$ , and then associate to every $x\in X$ an infinite 0,1 sequence, such that the sequence is the characteristic function of a subset of $D$ converging to $x$ . The only problem here is that I don't know whether $X$ is first countable, or at least Frechet-Urysohn. I believed it was true, for if there was a point $x$ with an uncountable local base, then one should be able to build an uncountable chain of basic clopens of $x$ . However, I am not sure if I am thinking of this in the wrong way. I then pursued another strategy: Using the clopen basis, it is easy to build a Cantor scheme $(A_s,\subseteq)$ , $s\in 2^{<\omega}$ , without the vanishing diameter condition, since we don't know about metrizability in $X$ . Nevertheless, if it is true that the set of chains of this scheme whose intersection is non-empty, then it is possible to define a continuous one-to-one function like the one we want. In other words, if the set $P=\{f\in 2^\omega:\bigcap_{n\in\omega}A_{f|_n}\neq\emptyset\}$ is uncountable, we are done. But I don't know if this is true. Looking up for answers, I found the concepts of ""Suslin representation"" and ""Suslin operation"", which seem to address similar problems. However, they seem to involve too much infinitary combinatorics for Todorcevic to not refer to a particular paper, book, or result that implies the assertion.

My previous attempt for the proof was wildly incorrect (my question was how that proof was exactly my old proof was incorrect) and I have now come up with a new proof. I have to prove: Let $f:(a, b) \to R^1$ be differentiable. Prove that $f$ is convex iff $f'$ is monotonically increasing. What I have for the proof: ( $\Rightarrow$ ) Assume $f$ is convex in $(a, b)$ . Let $a<s<t<u<b$ . By Exercise 23 in Chapter 4, \begin{align}\tag{14.1}             \frac{f(t)-f(s)}{t-s} \le \frac{f(u)-f(s)}{u-s} \le \frac{f(u)-f(t)}{u-t}  \end{align} Since $f$ is differentiable on $(a,b)$ , both $ f'(s) = \lim_{t  \to s} \frac{f(t)-f(s)}{t-s}$ and $f'(t)=\lim_{u  \to t} \frac{f(u)-f(t)}{u-t}$ exist. However, applying the Order Limit Theorem on (14.1) gives \begin{align*}         \lim_{t  \to s} \frac{f(t)-f(s)}{t-s} \le \lim_{u  \to t} \frac{f(u)-f(t)}{u-t} \implies f'(s) \le f'(t)     \end{align*} which shows that $f'$ is monotonically increasing in $(a, b)$ . ( $\Leftarrow$ ) Assume $f'$ is monotonically increasing in $(a, b)$ and $a<x<y<b$ . Fix $0 < \lambda< 1$ . By Exercise 23 in Chapter 4, we must show that \begin{equation}\tag{14.0}         f(\lambda x + (1- \lambda)y) \le \lambda f(x) + (1-\lambda) f(y)     \end{equation} Denote $z=\lambda x+ (1-\lambda)y$ .Then, $z=\lambda(x-y)+y$ which implies that $\lambda=\frac{z-y}{x-y}$ . Since $\lambda>0, z-y>x-y \implies z>x$ . Also, $1-\lambda=\frac{x-y-z+y}{x-y} = \frac{x-z}{x-y}$ . Since $\lambda<1, x-z>x-y \implies z < y$ . Thus, $x<z<y$ . Then, (14.0) can be simplified as: \begin{align*}         f(z) &\le f(y) + \lambda f(x) - \lambda f(y) \\         \lambda f(z) - \lambda f(x) &\le f(y) - f(z) - \lambda f(y) + \lambda f(z) \\          \lambda[f(z)-f(x)] &\le (1-\lambda)[f(y)-f(z)]     \end{align*} Thus, since $\lambda = \frac{y-z}{y-x}$ and $1-\lambda = \frac{z-x}{y-x}$ , it suffices to show that \begin{equation}\tag{14.2}          \frac{f(z)-f(x)}{z-x} \le \frac{f(y)-f(z)}{y-z}     \end{equation} Now, as we take $z\to x$ on the left of (14.2) and $y\to z$ on the right of (14.2), then we have $f'(x)\le f'(z)$ , which holds since $x<z$ and $f'$ is monotonically increasing.

Prove that every convex function is continuous. Hint: If $f$ is convex in $(a, b)$ and if $a < s < t < u < b$ , show that $$ \frac{ f(t)-f(s)}{t-s} \leq \frac{ f(u)-f(s)}{u-s} \leq \frac{ f(u)-f(t)}{u-t}.$$ Can someone please read over my proof and see if there is something that I did incorrectly?

I want to treat the analytic continuation of the zeta-function as some kind of conformal mapping between two regions, $A$ $B$ of the complex plane, with $\zeta : A \rightarrow B$ , which satisfy the following two properties Neither $A$ nor $B$ are the entire complex plane One or both of $A$ or $B$ are not simply connected One of the guiding principles I have is that the singularity at $z=1$ somehow represents ""the point at infinity in the Riemann sphere"" and to ""treat the entire complex plane as a projective plane in the sense of projective geometry"", and that the critical region between $z=0$ and $z=1$ is somehow related to ""the topology of the projective plane"" Intuitively, at least for me, the projective plane is a ""twisted up 2 dimensional space where you cover a watermelon with cellophane and then twist it off at the top and glue it back together in a non-realistic non-physical way"" More rigorously, we can represent the topology of the projective plane as a square, or so-called ""fundamental rectangle"", where the sides of the square are ""glued together"" in a specific way as shown in this picture I just had the most strange idea which is to try and make the singularity of the zeta-function at $z=1$ a point at infinity in the projective plane, and to try and map the critical strip to the so-called ""twist off"" section of the projective plane which results from ""gluing together"" the fundamental rectangle in the described way There are many reasons I was led to this kind of approach, but at this time I have no idea if anyone has ever tried this before, or if this is a very bad/silly idea that won't work.  I will only provide one more piece of information about the motivation at this time, feel free to ask if you are curious in the comments. The basic idea is to figure out if it's possible to show that the critical line, $Im(z)=\frac{1}{2}$ , corresponds somehow to the ""line at infinity"" in the projective plane (EDIT: Here is one way to view the complex plane as a projective plane: consider a 3-dimensional real space and imagine a unit sphere centered at the origin. Construct the projective plane using the standard definition of the set of all lines passing through the origin. Project all points of 3-d space onto the surface of this sphere with this construction in a 2-1 way; then project all the  points on the surface of this sphere (except for one) onto the complex plane using the Riemann sphere projection.)","I have a very vague intuitive idea which I have been struggling to give a meaningful definition to, and was wondering if this idea I am working on has been tried before.
