Find the probability that a poker hand can be....,,"a) Four of a kind (Contains four cards of equal face value) So for this one, we want four cards that have the same face value, different suit. And the last card can be any remaining card. There are 13 ranks, (A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K). We have $\binom{13}{1}$ ways to pick 1 rank out of 13. For each of these ranks, we want to pick 4 cards that are all the same rank (and it is forcefully implied that these 4 cards will differ in suits). So $\binom{13}{1}\binom{4}{4}$ , and for each of these ways, we have $\binom{48}{1}$ way to pick 1 card out of the remaining deck of 48 cards, because we picked 4 cards already. Thus, $$\frac{\binom{13}{1}\binom{4}{4}\binom{48}{1}}{\binom{52}{5}}$$ is the total number of ways. b) Full House (Three cards of equal face value, and two others of equal face value). So i.e: 3, 3, 3, 2, 2 would be a full house where the three 3's and two 2's are distinguishable (different suit). So there are 13 ranks again, $\binom{13}{1}$ ways to pick 1 rank out of 13 total. For each of these ways, we want to pick three cards of the same rank. So $\binom{13}{1}\binom{4}{3}$ . Now we want two more cards that are of equal face value that differ from the other three cards picked earlier, so there are 12 ranks left, and $\binom{12}{1}$ ways to pick 1 rank out of 12 remaining. For each of these ways, we have $\binom{4}{2}$ ways to pick 2 cards out of the 4 suits belonging to the same rank, thus $\binom{12}{1}\binom{4}{2}$ .

Now we want two cards that have different face values from the three picked, and each other. Now here is where I'm a bit confused, the ranks MUST be different, but the suits can be the same. So proceeding, $\binom{12}{1} \binom{4}{1}$ to pick 1 card of a different face value, but could be same suit, and then $\binom{11}{1}\binom{4}{1}$ to pick another card with a different face value, but could be a different suit.

And the last card can be any remaining card. There are 13 ranks, (A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K). We have ways to pick 1 rank out of 13. For each of these ranks, we want to pick 4 cards that are all the same rank (and it is forcefully implied that these 4 cards will differ in suits). So , and for each of these ways, we have way to pick 1 card out of the remaining deck of 48 cards, because we picked 4 cards already. Thus, is the total number of ways. b) Full House (Three cards of equal face value, and two others of equal face value). So i.e: 3, 3, 3, 2, 2 would be a full house where the three 3's and two 2's are distinguishable (different suit). So there are 13 ranks again, ways to pick 1 rank out of 13 total. For each of these ways, we want to pick three cards of the same rank. So . Now we want two more cards that are of equal face value that differ from the other three cards picked earlier, so there are 12 ranks left, and ways to pick 1 rank out of 12 remaining. For each of these ways, we have ways to pick 2 cards out of the 4 suits belonging to the same rank, thus . The total number of ways is: c) Three of a kind. (Three cards of equal face value, and two cards with face values that differ from each other and the other three). 13 ranks, we want to pick 3 cards of the same rank. . Now we want two cards that have different face values from the three picked, and each other. Now here is where I'm a bit confused, the ranks MUST be different, but the suits can be the same. So proceeding, to pick 1 card of a different face value, but could be same suit, and then to pick another card with a different face value, but could be a different suit.

It might seem a little computery at first, but I hope to think it's mostly a math problem. I am thinking about Memory Address Spaces , which you can imagine as like a page of monospaced text. Essentially it's a grid like a cartesian grid, where the content flows from left to right. So it's essentially one lone line. Each ""slot"" in this line is an address (1 byte let's say, but I don't think it matters for this question). What I'm thinking about is how to effectively ""point"" to different areas in the address space from other areas in the address space. You can visualize it as a line like this.... ___________________________________________ | | |8| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8                ^ So basically, address 3 points to address 8 by containing a 1-byte value 8 in its slot. I would draw it with more slots but there's not enough room. But on a typical computer there could be several billion I think. But lets just say there are a lot of addressable slots and that this line is very long, like DNA perhaps. The problem is this. While the above example ""works"" because the number 8 is less than 1 byte, if we instead wanted to point to position 1000 we couldn't because for our purposes, we are limited to 1-byte or position 256. The way this is typically solved in computer science is to just have 4-byte pointers (32-bits) instead of 1-byte (8-bit) pointers. This gives sufficiently large values so you can't really use them all without running into unrelated problems like memory limits and such. But I would like to try to solve this differently in this example. Instead of using 32-bit pointers, I'm wondering if there is a way to somehow use a bundle of 8-bit pointers in some way which I have been having a hard time imagining and so it will be hard to explain. Basically, say you are at slot 10,000 (10k), and want to point to something at position 1 million (1M). If it was 32-bits, then we could just plop in a large integer 1M and we are done. But since we are limited to 8-bit integers only (or 7 or 6-bit, etc., I don't mind either way, but 8 makes it easy, just something small), we have to do something tricky, which in some sense seems sort of like hashing in a hashing function. What I'm wondering is if you can do something like the following.... 50 (some other 8-bit value)                           jump a few    /                                times   /           we can navigate here                     value ----------> / --------> /                      123             |  jumps... |  ____________________|_______________v___________|______________________ | | | | | | | | | | ||| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ... 10k ...         ...         1M                      ^                           ^ To explain, in the address slot 10k we have value 123. This allows us to jump in some way to some other slot . We do this jumping a few times, by grabbing values at the next address slot we land at, until we get to the destination address point of 1M. That is to say, there is a way to point from 10k to 1M using only 8-bit values . This would be easy and have an obvious solution if it wasn't limited by the fact that I left out: there can only be one value in a slot at a time. So after a program runs for a while, you can imagine that the slots would be filled, with holes here and there like Swiss cheese. So you might not be able to guarantee that you can reach within 256 from your current location to the next location along the line.

Another common solution I'm seeing which is no help is people just saying well you know that if $(3x+11)$ and $(5x+18)$ are relatively prime then there there are two integers s, t such that $$as+bt =1$$ and they pull out like $(3x+11)(5) + (-3)(5x+18) = 1 $ which is great and fine and all but I have no idea how to get those two numbers by any sort of method besides just guessing.

46,Empty relation on non-empty set - is it reflexive?,Empty relation on non-empty set - is it reflexive?,,"I have here a relation defined by a conjunction of contradictory conditions, i.e. $R = \{ \langle x,y \rangle \in \mathbb N ^2  |  x = y^2 \land y = -x \}$ So, at least as I understand my undergrad course so far, this produces an empty relation, since there are no pairs of natural numbers such that one is the negative of the other. I can see why such a relation would be symmetrical and transitive, since both of these properties involve an implication. However, I am trying to determine if this relation is reflexive or irreflexive. My professor suggested that this would be computable for any relation, but in my mind, reflexivity is defined based on the presence of at least one element in the relation's domain. And if there are no elements in the relation, then how can they be in relation with themselves? Some help, any help, would be appreciated!! P.S. If anybody can recommend a modern manual for this subject, I'd really appreciate it. There is no recommended reading in this course, and the classes aren't very enlightening.

61,Counting equivalence classe - proof theorem,Counting equivalence classe - proof theorem,,"THEOREM: ( Counting equivalence classes ) Let $R$ be an equivalence relation on a finite set $A$. If all the equivalence relation of a finite set $A$ have the same size, $m$, then the number of equivalence classes is $|A|/m$. First comment, I think that the number of equivalence class is always $|A|$, because $\forall a \in A : a \in [a]$. In general we suppose different equivalence classes on $A$ like the theorem. Is that correct ? proof Let $R$ be an equivalence relation on a finite set A and all the equivalence classes of $R$ have the same size $m$. So, each equivalence class contains $m$ elements, $[a_1] = \{a_1, a_2, \dots,a_m\}$ and we know (every element is related to itself) $a_1 \in [a_1], a_2 \in [a_2], \dots, a_m \in [a_m]$. Because if $[a_i] \cap [a_j] \neq \emptyset, 1 \leq i < j \leq m$, then $[a_i] = [a_j]$. We have $m$ same equivalence classes. Now, I am not sure how continue... It can be question like this. We have 100 beads, and 10 different colours. Each colours have 10 beads (e. g. blue has 10 beads, green has 10 bead, and so   on). How many different (by colour) beads we have?

Thank you.","THEOREM: ( Counting equivalence classes ) Let $R$ be an equivalence relation on a finite set $A$. If all the equivalence relation of a finite set $A$ have the same size, $m$, then the number of equivalence classes is $|A|/m$. First comment, I think that the number of equivalence class is always $|A|$, because $\forall a \in A : a \in [a]$. In general we suppose different equivalence classes on $A$ like the theorem. Is that correct ? proof Let $R$ be an equivalence relation on a finite set A and all the equivalence classes of $R$ have the same size $m$. So, each equivalence class contains $m$ elements, $[a_1] = \{a_1, a_2, \dots,a_m\}$ and we know (every element is related to itself) $a_1 \in [a_1], a_2 \in [a_2], \dots, a_m \in [a_m]$. Because if $[a_i] \cap [a_j] \neq \emptyset, 1 \leq i < j \leq m$, then $[a_i] = [a_j]$. We have $m$ same equivalence classes. Now, I am not sure how continue... It can be question like this. We have 100 beads, and 10 different colours. Each colours have 10 beads (e. g. blue has 10 beads, green has 10 bead, and so   on). How many different (by colour) beads we have? Of course answer is   100/10 = 10. How many different equivalence classes we have? - immediately, the answer is $|A|/m$. Can you please check my proof?

I can check on wolfram alpha that the factorisation looks like:  $x^{15}-1=(x+1)(x^2+x+1)(x^4+x+1)(x^4+x^3+1)(x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1)$ Now my hint suggested there are only $2$ quartic polynomials but this makes use of $3$...unless the $3$rd one is not primitive? And also, how could one find this factorisation easily by hand? The one above I could attempt trial and error to find the irreducible polynomial of degree $6$ perhaps but for this one that seems a bit strange.

(I'm considering that $0$ represents ""white"" and $1$ represents ""black"".) The probability of a certain element being $1$ is $\mathrm{p}$. At that certain probability $\mathrm{p}$, we count the number the number of white clusters and number of black clusters in the matrix. Any two elements who share a side (i.e. any one of them lies to the left, right, top or bottom of the other) or share a vertex are considered to belong to the same cluster. BUT, there's one special case i.e. if anywhere in the matrix there occurs a situation like this: 0 | 1 1 | 0 OR 1 | 0 0 | 1 That is two $1$'s share a vertex (diagonally connected) and two $0$'s also share a vertex as shown, the $50\%$ of the times, one should consider the $1$'s to belong to same cluster and other $50\%$ of the times one should consider the $0$'s to belong to the same cluster. Suppose I am gradually increasing $\mathrm{p}$ from $0$ to $100$ in steps of $0.001$ and counting the number of black and white clusters for each $\mathrm{p}$. My aim is to find that critical probability $\mathrm{P_{c1}}$ at which number of white clusters increases from $1$ to a number greater than $1$ as $\mathrm{N}\to\infty$. Also I need to find $\mathrm{P_{c2}}$ at which number of black clusters decreases from a number greater than $1$ to $1$. To be more clear, Let $\mathcal{C}_0, \mathcal{C}_1$ denote the clusters of 0's and 1's   in the matrix (or graph), respectively. We are defining $\mathrm{P_{c1}}$ as $$ \mathcal{C}_{0} = \begin{cases} 1 & \qquad p < \mathrm{P_{c1}} \\ >  1 & \qquad p > \mathrm{P_{c1}} \end{cases} $$ and $\mathrm{P_{c2}}$ as $$ \mathcal{C}_{1} = \begin{cases} > 1 & \qquad p < \mathrm{P_{c2}} \\ 1  & \qquad p > \mathrm{P_{c2}} \end{cases} $$ for $N\to\infty$. I wrote a program for the $1000\times 1000$ case, and averaged the critical probabilities over $10$ iterations. (The program basically had a loop which ran from $\mathrm{p}=0$ to $\mathrm{p}=100$ and I outputted those $\mathrm{p}$'s at which the number of white clusters increased from $1$ and number of black clusters decreased to $1$) The value I got for $\mathrm{P_{c1}}$ was $0.05$ and for $\mathrm{P_{c2}}$ it was $0.96$. However, I don't know if any purely mathematical technique exists to find the convergence value of these two critical probabilities for the infinite matrix case (i.e. $\mathrm{N}\to \infty$). Around $3$ decimal places of accuracy will be enough for my purpose. Any help will be appreciated.","Suppose I have an $\mathrm{N\times N}$ square matrix consisting of only $0$'s and $1$'s.

When it says ""type 3"" it refers to the Chomsky Hierarchy of the types of grammars, and there are 4 types, where $G_3\subset G_2\subset G_1\subset G_0$. As I think it is in type 3, I am going to write the definition that I have: A grammar is Type 3 if all production $x\to y$: $x \text{ it is a single symbol of the non-terminal elements;}\\ y \text{ is }\left\{\begin{array}{l}\text{The concatenation of 2 symbols, one of them being terminal,}\\\qquad\qquad\text{or}\\\text{A single terminal symbol,}\\\qquad\qquad\text{or}\\\text{It is the null word.}\end{array}\right.$ With this I can affirm that both production $A\to x\: A/y\: B$ and production $B\to x\: B/x$ meet these requirements, and therefore the grammar is type 3.

Therefore, it will never generate a finite language. Is it right?
