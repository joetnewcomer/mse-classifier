However, I believe there is some loophole in the argument because I don't see this argument being presented anywhere. Let $K$ by a number field (i.e. finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}$), with $[K:\mathbb{Q} ] = n$. The ring of integers $O_K$ is the integral closure of $\mathbb{Z}$ in $K$. We can define a map $O_K \otimes_\mathbb{Z} \mathbb{Q} \to K$ where we define $\alpha \otimes q \mapsto \alpha q$ (and extend linearly). In my class, I saw that this is an isomorphism of $\mathbb{Q}$-vector spaces, so I don't think there is anything wrong with that claim.

I'm not finding information on this.,,"I'm investigating dual quaternions and am having to learn a lot of stuff myself because I'm finding very few resources on the mathematical background. I know that the magnitude of a dual quaternion is a dual number.  This makes sense because it is a dual number with real quaternions jammed into its real components.  Alternately, it is a quaternion with dual numbers jammed into its real components.  Both approaches yield the same form. Question: But what is magnitude of a dual number?  Does that question even make sense? I know that the magnitude of a complex number is the root of sum of the squares of the real numbers.  Ditto for a real quaternion.  But the dual number operator epsilon (I'll abbreviate it as simply 'e') is not like the irrational unit numbers.  Square any of the irrational unit numbers and you get -1.  Square e and you get 0.  This makes the dual number completely useless as a rotor, but it still has use as a multi-part number.  I'm wondering if nature of this dual operator also makes it unsuitable to calculate its magnitude with the Pythagorean Theorem. Again, the magnitude of a dual quaternion is a dual number, and it doesn't make sense to me to calculate the magnitude again just to get a pure real number, so I've postulated that the magnitude of a dual number is simply itself , like saying that the magnitude of the real number 5 is simply 5.

94,Why does $V(I(S))=\overline{S}$?,Why does ?,V(I(S))=\overline{S},"Let $S\subset\operatorname{Spec}A$ , where $A$ is a commutative ring with $1$ . I am having trouble seeing why $V(I(S))=\overline{S}$ , where $\overline{S}$ is the Zariski closure of $S$ . My attempt is as follows. It is not hard to see that $S\subset V(I(S))$ : $V(I(S))$ is the set of all prime ideals of $A$ containing $I(S)$ , and $I(S)$ is the intersection of all elements (prime ideals) of $S$ .
