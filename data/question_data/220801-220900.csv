4,Basics of schemes and morphisms of schemes,Basics of schemes and morphisms of schemes,,"I'm currently reading through Hartshorne, and have come across a few things that have left me wondering. (i) Somewhat pedantic, but also because I don't actually know the answer, (in Example 2.3.4) he looks at the affine plane over an algebraically closed field, defined as the scheme of $k[x,y]$, and discusses some of its properties. He says Also, for each irreducible polynomial $f(x,y)$, there is a point $\eta$ whose closure consists of $\eta$ together with all closed points $(a,b)$ for which $f(a,b) = 0$. We say that $\eta$ is a generic point of the curve $f(x,y) = 0$. Now, is $\eta$ unique? The way I read the first sentence, I feel there should be only one such point, but then he says $\eta$ is a generic point instead of the generic point, which really made me feel it was not unique when I read it. (ii) The two definitions before Example 3.2.1 define certain morphisms to be locally of finite type , finite type or simply finite , but the very next example says a scheme (with no morphism between schemes in the example) is of finite type. What does this mean? Perhaps that the scheme itself admits a covering via affine subsets that are the Spec of rings? (iii) Consider $R = \mathbb{C}[x]/(x^2)$. Then Spec $R$ has only one element, namely $(x)$. Hence Spec $R$ is irreducible. In a somewhat entertaining way however, Spec $R$ is not reduced. This follows quite easily from Example 3.0.1 in the book (in particular ""$X$ is reduced if and only if nil $A = 0$"", where nil $A$ is the nilradical of $A$, which in our case is $(x)$) but I'm fairly new to localization, so what hoping someone could make sure I'm not making a silly mistake in trying to show this directly. Is the localization of $R$ at $(x)$ simple $R$ again? (And hence the sheaf $\mathcal{O}((x)) = R$, which certainly has non-zero nilpotents.) I should add, for the last one, I'm sure it was not Hartshorne that decided to use irreducible and reduced for distinct things, but I'm curious if anyone knows why the terminology came about this way?

5,Vector space structure of the Zariski tangent space,Vector space structure of the Zariski tangent space,,"Let $X$ be a $k$ -scheme and $p\in X(k)$ .

7,Global sections of a proper variety over an arbitrary field,Global sections of a proper variety over an arbitrary field,,"While doing some research, I stumbled upon the following fact that I'd taken for granted. Theorem: Let $ X $ be a proper variety over a field $ k $ (variety = geometrically integral, separated, finite type). Then $ \Gamma(X, \mathcal{O}_X) $ is a finite field extension of $ k $ . The line of proof I have in mind is as follows: Let $ s \in \Gamma(X, \mathcal{O}_X) $ be a global section. It corresponds to a morphism $ s : X \rightarrow \mathbb{A}^1_k $ . This morphism factors as $$ X \xrightarrow{(id_X, s)} X \times_k \mathbb{A}^1_k \xrightarrow{p_2} \mathbb{A}^1_k $$ where $ (id_X, s) $ is a section of the first projection $ p_1 : X \times_k \mathbb{A}^1_k \rightarrow X $ . In the composition, the first morphism is a closed immersion (being a section of the separated morphism $ p_1 $ ) and the second is a closed map by properness. So $ s $ is a closed map. The image of $ s $ is proper, closed and irreducible, hence is a single closed point in $ \mathbb{A}^1_k $ , say given by an irreducible polynomial $ h(T) \in k[T] $ . This shows that $ h(s) = 0 $ in $ \Gamma(X, \mathcal{O}_X) $ and hence the global sections form a field. If $ k $ was assumed algebraically closed, then $ h $ must be of the form $ T - a $ for some $ a \in k $ . In this case, we recover the result that $ \Gamma(X, \mathcal{O}_X) = k $ . However if $ k $ is arbitrary, I don't see how to get finite dimensionality of $ \Gamma(X, \mathcal{O}_X) $ although $ s $ itself lies in a finite extension. Question: How to complete the proof?

11,Intersection Theory on a Surface,Intersection Theory on a Surface,,"I have some problems to prove the exercise 20.2.A part (b) in Ravi Vakil's ""Fondation of Algebraic Geometry"". Here the excerpt: The setting is: We have a surface $X$ (therefore 2-dimensional, proper $k$ -scheme) and two effective divisors $C,D$ (therefore curves) such that $C$ and $D$ don't have common irreducible components. To show: $$(D \cdot C) = h^0(D \cap C, \mathcal{O}_{C \cap D})$$ My efforts: Since by definition and exercise 20.2.A (a) we already know that $(D \cdot C) = deg(\mathcal{O}_X(D) \vert _C) = \chi(\mathcal{O}_X(D) \vert _C) - \chi(\mathcal{O}_C)$ here $\chi$ is the Euler characteristic and $\mathcal{O}_X(D)$ the corresponing invertible sheaf to divisor $D$ . The ideal is to show that following sequence is exact: (*) $$0 \to \mathcal{O}_C(-D) \to \mathcal{O}_C \to \mathcal{O}_{D \cap C} \to 0$$ and then using the additivity of Euler charecteristic and the fact that $\chi(\mathcal{O}_{C \cap D})= h^0(D \cap C, \mathcal{O}_{C \cap D})$ since this intersection is zero dimensional. Since this sequence arrises from the sequence $0 \to \mathcal{O}_X(-D) \to \mathcal{O}_X \to \mathcal{O}_D \to 0$ by tensoring with $\mathcal{O}_C$ the only cruical point is to prove that $\mathcal{O}_C(-D) \to \mathcal{O}_C$ is injective. By definition this can be done on level of stalks. By definition the stalks are given by $\mathcal{O}_{C,c} = \mathcal{O}_{X,c}/(g)$ and $\mathcal{O}(-D)_{X,c} = f\mathcal{O}_{X,c}$ for regular $f, g \in \mathcal{O}_{X,c}$ since $C,D$ effective divisors. Therefore we get $\mathcal{O}_C(-D)_c = \mathcal{O}(-D)_{X,c} \otimes \mathcal{O}_{C,c}= f\mathcal{O}_{X,c} \otimes \mathcal{O}_{X,c}/(g) = f\mathcal{O}_{X,c}/(fg)$ So I have to show that $$f\mathcal{O}_{X,c}/(fg) \to \mathcal{O}_{X,c}/(g)$$ is injective for every $c \in C$ . Since $C$ is a curve two cases could happen: $c$ is generic point (of $C$ ) $c$ is a closed Could anybody help to show the desired injectivity for these two cases? I don't see where I can use the assumption that $C$ and $D$ don't have common irreducible components.

Looking around in [Stacks], I found the following: By 092M , weakly étale ring homomorphisms are formally unramified. By 00UU , a formally unramified ring homomorphism of finite presentation is unramified. By 08WD , a flat unramified ring homomorphism of finite presentation is étale. This seems to be a complete proof that weakly étale ring homomorphisms of finite presentation are indeed étale. Did I miss anything? I'm surprised that this statement does not appear outright in [Stacks].",,"['algebraic-geometry', 'reference-request', 'commutative-algebra']"

A cover by open subfunctors means, that for every scheme $T$ and for every morphism $h_T\rightarrow F$ , the pullback $F_i\times_F h_T$ is representable, say by $Y_i$ and the morphism of schemes $Y_i\rightarrow T$ corresponding to the projection $F_i\times_F h_T\rightarrow h_T$ is an open immersion. In addition the images of $Y_i\rightarrow T$ form an open covering of $T$ Let me explain what I have done so far and where I am stuck: The $X_i$ can be glued to a scheme $X$ . The morphisms $h_{X_i}\cong F_i\rightarrow F$ correspond via the yoneda lemma to elements $f_i\in F(X_i)$ .  Using the sheaf property of F, the $f_i$ glue together to an element $f\in F(X)$ which gives us a natural transformation $\alpha: h_X\rightarrow F$ . For a scheme $T$ and a morphism $g\in\mathrm{Hom}(T,X)$ this is given by $\alpha(T)(g)=F(g)(f)$ . The last step is to show that this assignment is bijective. I managed to show the surjectivity, but can't find a proof for the injectivity. It would suffice to show that the following diagram is a pullback $\require{AMScd}$ \begin{CD} h_{X_i} @>>> h_X\\@VidVV @VV\alpha V\\ h_{X_i} @>>> F \end{CD} where the morphism $h_{X_i}\rightarrow h_X$ is induced from the open immersion $X_i\rightarrow  X$ .

This leads me to a more general wondering. I'm getting a little bit hopeless after a couple days trying to understand that book. And i thought i had a decent formation in scheme theory. I often have a problem ""reducing a geometric claim to its algebraic content""; like for instance when people say, ""after base change we are left to prove that for a local domain etc...."", this part always seems obscure to me, and i have to work out tediously the details to be convinced of the ""reduction procedures"". Is that supposed to be so? Because Futlon seems so casual about it, like it should be obvious, and if you dont see it, well, there's something that you have failed to understand. In the maths i've done up to now, sometimes i said that something was ""clearly"" so, and i knew that if i wanted to i could work out the details, but i feel, in algebraic geometry, sometimes you cannot chop down an argument into tiny bits, you have to see it or not. So is it obvious to everyone why certains reductions work (like the one mentionned in that proof)? Or is it just me (and i'm probably bad at alg. geom. ? Sorry for this long question.

Now, this seems like it should be blatantly obvious, and the proof in the book more or less treats it as such. I'm having trouble with the first line: If $Y$ is a prime divisor on $X$, then $Y\cap U$ is either empty or a prime divisor on $U$. Clearly the former possibility is trivial. For some reason, I'm having trouble with the latter. A prime divisor is defined to be a closed integral subscheme of codimension one. Now, obviously $Y\cap U$ is closed in $U$. But to refer to it as a closed subscheme, don't I need to know what the subscheme structure is?

I now consider the blow-up of $Y:=\mathbb{P}^n$ in $X$, yielding a blow-up diagram $$\begin{matrix} \tilde{X} & \xrightarrow{\; j\;} & \tilde{Y} \\ \hphantom{\scriptstyle g}\downarrow {\scriptstyle g} && \hphantom{\scriptstyle f}\downarrow {\scriptstyle f} \\ X &\xrightarrow{\;i\;} & Y  \end{matrix}$$ My question is, what is the second chern class $c_2(\tilde Y):=c_2(\mathcal{T}_{\tilde{Y}})$ of the tangent sheaf of $\tilde{Y}$? Remark : I am ultimately interested in the degree of $c_2(\tilde Y)c_1^{n-2}(\tilde Y)$. My thoughts so far: As you can see from my first question, the chern classes of $Y$ (and $X$) have well-known representation, and there is a formula for computing the chern classes of blown-up varieties in Fulton's book Intersection Theory , namely Theorem 15.4 . For brevity, I will quote his Example 15.4.3 , which gives a formula for $c_2$: $$c_2(\tilde Y) = f^\ast(c_2(Y)) - j_\ast\left( (d-1) g^\ast(c_1(X)) + \tfrac{d(d-3)}{2} \zeta + (d-2) g^\ast(c_1(\mathcal{N})) \right)$$ Here, $\mathcal{N}=\mathcal{N}_{X/Y}$ is the normal bundle of $X$ in $Y$ and $\zeta$ denotes $c_1(\mathcal{O}_{\tilde{X}}(1))$. Of course, $c_1(\mathcal{N})=c_1(i^\ast\mathcal{T}_Y)/c_1(\mathcal{T}_X)$ by the well-known exact sequence  $$0\to\mathcal{T}_X\to i^\ast\mathcal{T}_Y\to\mathcal{N}_{X/Y}\to 0,$$ but I am not 100% sure what effect the pullbacks and push-forwards have.

80,Nice definition of Grothendieck topology?,Nice definition of Grothendieck topology?,,"In Scholze's masterclass on condensed mathematics, there was a discussion whether there is a ""good definition of a site"". It seems, that the definition of Grothendieck topology using sieves is the most general. If one works with Grothendieck pretopologies one has to worry about existence of certain pullbacks. So I am not interested in pretopologies, instead I want to conceptualize the sieve-definition. This is what I have: The usual definition of Grothendieck topology based on sieves (see e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grothendieck_topology , or Alternative formulation of Grothendieck topology ) can be rewritten as follows: Def. A Grothendieck topology on a small category $\mathcal C$ is a functor $J : \mathcal C^{\mathrm{op}} \to \mathrm{Set}$ with the following three properties: $J$ is a subfunctor of $\mathrm{Sv}$ . Here $\mathrm{Sv}(X)$ is the set of sieves on $X$ and for any morphism $f : Y \to X$ the map $f^* : \mathrm{Sv}(X) \to \mathrm{Sv}(Y)$ is given by pullback of sieves (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grothendieck_topology ) $J_{\mathrm{ind}}$ is a subfunctor of $J$ , where $J_{\mathrm{ind}}(X) = \{\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal C}(-,X)\}$ . For all $X \in \mathcal C$ and all $S \in J(X)$ , we have $$ J(X) = \{T \in \mathrm{Sv}(X) \mid \forall (f : Y \to X) \in S : f^*T \in J(Y)\}$$ 1 and 2 just say, that $J$ is somewhere between the indiscrete and the discrete Grothendieck topology. I am completely happy with that. The way I read 3 is: Being a $J$ -covering sieve is a $J$ -local property. This looks like a ""circular"" sheaf condition. If $X \in \mathcal C$ and $T$ is a sieve on $X$ , then we define a presheaf on $\mathcal C \downarrow X$ by $$ \mathcal F_{T}(f : Y \to X) = \begin{cases} \{*\}, &f^*T \in J(Y), \\ \emptyset, &\text{else.} \end{cases} $$ This is a $J$ -sheaf if and only if for all $Y$ and all covering sieves $S \in J(Y)$ , the map $$ \mathcal F_T(Y) \to \prod_{(f:V \to Y)\in S} \mathcal F_T(V) $$ is bijective. This for all $X$ and $T$ is equivalent to 3. So we can take: For all $X \in \mathcal C$ and all $T \in \mathrm{Sv}(X)$ , the presheaf $\mathcal F_T$ on $\mathcal C \downarrow X$ is a $J$ -sheaf. Grothendieck topologies are often advertised as the ""right generalization"" of topological spaces for the definition of sheaves. Since 1 and 2 don't say much about $J$ , all interesting topological features hide inside of 3. So it might be interesting to ask: Is there a nice(r) way to express 3? (or the entire definition?)

Let $X$ be a reduced noetherian scheme. Show that $X$ is affine if and only if each irreducible component is affine Clearly, if $X$ is affine, the compoents are closed subschemes so affine as well. For the converse, I guess one  has to use the following Proposition, because the chapter is rather short, but contains this strong criterion to be affine: Proposition III 3.7. A noetherian scheme $X$ is affine iff $H^1(X, \mathcal{I}) = 0$ for every (coherent) sheaf of ideals $\mathcal{I} \subset \mathcal{O}_X$ iff $H^1(X, \mathcal{F}) = 0$ for all quasi-coherent sheaves $\mathcal{F}$ . But I don't know how to relate sheaf cohomology on $X$ to the cohomology the components. Two thoughts I had: If $i: Z \hookrightarrow X$ is an irreducible compoent with ideal sheaf $I_Z \subset \mathcal{O}_X$ , then the cohomology of the quotient sheaf $i_*\mathcal{O}_Z = \mathcal{O}_X / I_Z$ vanishes, because I can take an injective resolution $\mathcal{O}_Z \to \mathcal{I}^*$ on $Z$ , and take the push-forward $i_*\mathcal{I}^*$ of this. Then the sheaves $i_*\mathcal{I}^k$ remain flasque, and I still get a resolution of $i_*\mathcal{O}_Z$ , which can be checked on the stalks. So we can use this resolution to commute the cohomology groups of $i_*\mathcal{O}_Z$ on $X$ , which will be the same as cohomology of $\mathcal{O}_Z$ on $Z$ , i.e. $0$ . Is that reasoning correct? Do I have to use Exercise 2.3 and 2.4?

ETA : Note that I am particularly interested in the ""and how"" part; which is to say that, given an (explicit) basis for $\Gamma(\mathcal{X}_s, \mathscr{L}_s)$, how do I go about finding an (explicit) basis for $\Gamma(\mathcal{X}, \mathscr{L})$ that satisfies the surjectivity properties above (assuming $\mathscr{L}$ exists)? My idea is to take a basis of $\Gamma(\mathcal{X}_s, \mathscr{L}_s)$, lift it to an $R$-module $M$, and take the saturation $\operatorname{Sat}(M) = R^n \cap (M \otimes_R k(\xi))$ where $n = \dim\Gamma(\mathcal{X}_s, \mathscr{L}_s)$.  Some related ""sub-questions"" based on this idea: Suppose $\Gamma(\mathcal{X}_s, \mathscr{L}_s)$ is generated by global sections $\{\bar{s}_0, \ldots, \bar{s}_r\}$ and let $M$ be the $R$-module generated by lifts $\{s_0, \ldots, s_r\}$ of the $\bar{s}_i$.  Let $\mathscr{M} = \widetilde{M}$ be the sheaf associated to $M$.  Then $M = \Gamma(\mathcal{X}, \mathscr{M}) \to \Gamma(\mathcal{X}_s, \mathscr{L}_s)$ is surjective.  Under what conditions is $\mathscr{M}$ invertible? Is this $\mathscr{M}$ isomorphic to $\pi_*\mathscr{L}_s$, where $\pi\colon\mathcal{X}_s \to \mathcal{X}$ is the canonical ""projection""? N.B. The conditions I listed in the first paragraph describe the (rather restrictive) situation I'm interested in; I would certainly be interested in hearing answers valid in a more general context.  Feel free to strengthen any conditions as necessary; for example, I think projective normality  might play a role somewhere, but I'm not sure where exactly.",,"['algebraic-geometry', 'sheaf-theory', 'schemes']"

Let $T$ be a contravariant functor on the category of complete varietties into the Category $\underline{\mathrm{Ab}}$ of abelian groups.

Consider the homomorphisms $$\alpha_T^n: \prod_{i=0}^n T(X_0\times\ldots\times \widehat{X_i}\times \ldots X_n) \to T(X_0\times\ldots \times X_n),$$ $$ \beta_T^n:  T(X_0\times\ldots \times X_n)\to \prod_{i=0}^n T(X_0\times\ldots\times \widehat{X_i}\times \ldots X_n),$$ defined in the natural way. One then prove by an easy induction on $n$ that we have natrual  splitting $$T(X_0\times\ldots \times X_n)=\mathrm{Im}\alpha\oplus \ker \beta.$$ The functor is said to be order $n$ if $\alpha $ is surjective or equivalently, $\beta$ is injective. Now if $T_i, i=1,2,3$ are contravariant functors on complete varieties into $\underline{\mathrm{Ab}}$, and $T_1\to T_2$ and $T_2\to T_3$ are natrual transformations such that $T_1\to T_2\to T_3$ is an exact sequence, and if $T_1$ and $T_3$ are of order $n$ so is $T_2$, as follows from the exactness of $$0=\ker\beta^n_{T_1}(X_0\times\ldots \times X_n)\to \ker\beta^n_{T_2}(X_0\times\ldots \times X_n) \to\ker\beta^n_{T_3}(X_0\times\ldots \times X_n)=0.$$ There are two things that I am having troube with.  First, I have tried a couple times to work out this ""easy"" induction but have not much success so far.  The base case is easy. For $n=2$, I got $\mathrm{Im}{\alpha}\cap \ker\beta=0$ part. But not much else. Secondly, I don't see where the exactness of this sequence involving the $\ker\beta_{T_i}$'s come from. It feels to me that one is claiming that  if we have a commutative diagram with exact rows, then the kernel of the vertical maps fit into a sequence that's exact in the middle, which is certainly not true, as one can easily take $B'=C'=0$ and produce counter examples. $$\begin{array}{cccc} A&\to & B & \to &  C\\ \downarrow& & \downarrow & & \downarrow\\ A' &\to & B' & \to &  C'\\ \end{array}$$","In section II.6 ""the theorem of the cube I"" of Mumford's ""Abelian Variety"" book, Mumford introduced the notion of functor of order $n$.
