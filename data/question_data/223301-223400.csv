6,Adjoint to $\mathsf{Proj}$? - A quest to understand categories of graded objects.,Adjoint to ? - A quest to understand categories of graded objects.,\mathsf{Proj},"I've been having a hard time with graded objects in algebraic geometry for some time. Lately I realized a lot of my difficulties come from not having any idea at all of where graded objects live. Having no idea what category they come from I am forced to swallow a lot of ad hoc constructions which are hard to internelize. So I decided to attack these core issues. Alas, I can't seem to find a source which treats the basics of categories of graded modules/algebras. I didn't find even the basic definition for a category in either cases. Here's what I have so far: Rings can be viewed as monoids in $\mathsf{Ab}$, modules are modules over monoids and algebras are monoids in the category of modules. This statement generalizes imediately to the category of graded abelian groups. The jist here (from what i've been able to gather) is we have (at least?) two choices for the braiding  in the symmetric monoidal category of graded abelian groups (kozul sign rule). I'm still having trouble though with the down to earth understanding. Here are couple of questions: How well behaved is the subcategory of positively/non-negatively graded modules/algebras? What is the graded tensor product? (pushout of graded algebras). Is the category of graded modules over a graded algebra abelian? Is graded localization of modules/rings/ algebras universal in some sense? Is the $\mathsf{Proj}$ functor adjoint to something? If so what equivalence of subcategories does it induce? All these would be much easier to answer once I have a clear definition of those categories and some basic properties.","I've been having a hard time with graded objects in algebraic geometry for some time.

7,Normalization of the projective closure of affine plane curve over $\mathbb{C}$,Normalization of the projective closure of affine plane curve over,\mathbb{C},"I am trying to understand how to do explicit calculations for finding the normalization of a plane curve. The intuition is somewhat clear to me: ""separate"" the singularities or smooth them out (for curves at least). However, in practice, finding the integral closure of a ring in its field of fractions is not so clear. I was reading through this thread and the comments, but I couldn't quite figure out how to see that you need to need to add ""x"" amount of points above a singularity. Example: Take the curve defined on the affine plane $y^2 = x^6 - 1$. It is smooth, and its projective closure is the curve defined by $Y^2Z^4 = X^6 - Z^6$ in the coordinates $[X,Y,Z]$ on $\mathbb{P}^2$. When $Z = 0$, we get $X = 0$ and $Y$ is free, so we add one point at infinity, $[0,1,0]$. By calculating the Jacobian or looking at the affine patch where $Y \neq 0$, we see that the projective closure is singular at this point. We are supposed to get two points from this one point in the normalization (since we know it is a hyperelliptic curve and there should be no ramification at $\infty$ in this case), but how am I supposed to see it? If I were to do it algebraically I would have to look at the integral closure of $\left(\frac{k[x,z]}{(x^6 - z^6 - z^4)}\right)_{(\bar{x},\bar{z})}$ in $k(\bar{x},\bar{y})$, and this doesn't look too enticing. If I were to go this route, how do I know how many points I have to add? Is it the rank of the integral closure as a module over the original ring?","I am trying to understand how to do explicit calculations for finding the normalization of a plane curve.

I assumed that, if there were a similar fact, then I would have found it somewhere. But after some thinking we see that points in projective space correspond to lines through the origin in affine space, which are irreducible affine varieties, but not affine points . Thus points in projective space correspond to (prime) ideals in $R$ coming from lines through the origin. In the opposite direction, maximal ideals in $R$ correspond to points in affine space, and so can't correspond directly to points in projective space but each point in affine space uniquely determines a point in projective space, since it uniquely determines a line through the origin and that point.

Let $p$ be the point $(1:0:1:0)\in X$, and let $Y$ be the plane $\{x=0\}$. Stereographic projection from $p$ gives a birational map $f$ from $X$ to $Y$. If I have calculated correctly, the map $X\mapsto Y$ is given by $$(x:y:z:w)\mapsto (0:y:z-x:w)$$ and the inverse $f^{-1}$ is given by $$(0:r:s:t)\mapsto (r^2-s^2-t^2:2rs:r^2+s^2-t^2:2st)$$ The original map is regular away from $p$. It seems to me that the inverse is regular away from $(0:1:0:\pm 1)$. What I want to know is why , from a geometric perspective, these are the only two points where the map is not regular. Geometrically, what is stopping $f^{-1}$ from being regular at $(0:1:0:\pm 1)$ and only these points? In more detail, here is my thinking and what I still want to understand: $f$ induces a bijection from points $q$ of $X$ to points $q'$ of $Y$ such that $q'$ is the intersection of $Y$ with the line through $p,q$ and $q$ is the intersection of the line through $p,q'$ with $X$ other than $p$. Any point $q$ of $X$ other than $p$ will give us a unique line through $p,q$ that hits $Y$ in a unique point $q'$, and this same line will determine $q$ from $q'$. Furthermore, every line through $p$ will hit $Y$ somewhere, and unless it is a tangent to $X$ at $p$ it will also hit $X$ at a second point $q$. It seems to me that this means that $f$ gives an isomorphism from $X\setminus\{p\}$ to $Y$ minus the $\mathbb{P}^1$'s worth of points where the tangents to $X$ at $p$ hit it. If I have calculated correctly, the points of $Y$ where the tangents to $X$ at $p$ hit it are given by $\{s=0\}$. So $f$ is giving a bijection from $X\setminus\{p\}$ to $Y\setminus\{s=0\}$, which is an affine plane. This explains why $f$ is regular away from $p$ and why $f^{-1}$ is regular away from $\{s=0\}$. What it does not explain is why $f^{-1}$ is also regular on $\{s=0\}$ except at $(0:1:0:\pm 1)$ . Any point $q'$ of $Y$ determines a line through $p,q'$. This line either hits $X$ twice or else is tangent to $X$ at $p$. I would have thought that whenever it is tangent to $X$ at $p$, then $f^{-1}(q')$ would be $p$; so that $f^{-1}$ should really be regular on all of $Y$. So, What is going wrong when I take $q'=(0:1:0:\pm 1)$? Thanks in advance.","Let $X\subset\mathbb{P}^3$ be the quadric surface cut out by $F(x,y,z,w)=x^2+y^2-z^2-w^2$.  Let $p$ be the point $(1:0:1:0)\in X$, and let $Y$ be the plane $\{x=0\}$. Stereographic projection from $p$ gives a birational map $f$ from $X$ to $Y$. If I have calculated correctly, the map $X\mapsto Y$ is given by $$(x:y:z:w)\mapsto (0:y:z-x:w)$$ and the inverse $f^{-1}$ is given by $$(0:r:s:t)\mapsto (r^2-s^2-t^2:2rs:r^2+s^2-t^2:2st)$$ The original map is regular away from $p$. It seems to me that the inverse is regular away from $(0:1:0:\pm 1)$. What I want to know is why , from a geometric perspective, these are the only two points where the map is not regular. Geometrically, what is stopping $f^{-1}$ from being regular at $(0:1:0:\pm 1)$ and only these points? In more detail, here is my thinking and what I still want to understand: $f$ induces a bijection from points $q$ of $X$ to points $q'$ of $Y$ such that $q'$ is the intersection of $Y$ with the line through $p,q$ and $q$ is the intersection of the line through $p,q'$ with $X$ other than $p$. Any point $q$ of $X$ other than $p$ will give us a unique line through $p,q$ that hits $Y$ in a unique point $q'$, and this same line will determine $q$ from $q'$. Furthermore, every line through $p$ will hit $Y$ somewhere, and unless it is a tangent to $X$ at $p$ it will also hit $X$ at a second point $q$. It seems to me that this means that $f$ gives an isomorphism from $X\setminus\{p\}$ to $Y$ minus the $\mathbb{P}^1$'s worth of points where the tangents to $X$ at $p$ hit it. If I have calculated correctly, the points of $Y$ where the tangents to $X$ at $p$ hit it are given by $\{s=0\}$. So $f$ is giving a bijection from $X\setminus\{p\}$ to $Y\setminus\{s=0\}$, which is an affine plane. This explains why $f$ is regular away from $p$ and why $f^{-1}$ is regular away from $\{s=0\}$. What it does not explain is why $f^{-1}$ is also regular on $\{s=0\}$ except at $(0:1:0:\pm 1)$ . Any point $q'$ of $Y$ determines a line through $p,q'$. This line either hits $X$ twice or else is tangent to $X$ at $p$. I would have thought that whenever it is tangent to $X$ at $p$, then $f^{-1}(q')$ would be $p$; so that $f^{-1}$ should really be regular on all of $Y$.
