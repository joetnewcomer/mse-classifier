I don't know if there is a general answer, for instance there is only one for $F=\mathbf{R}$, viz. $\mathbf{C}$, and no one for $F=\mathbf{C}$, for it is  algebraically closed. There may be a more precise answer for quadratic extension of number fields. For $F=\mathbf{Q}$, there are only two, every real extension being isomorphic and of the form $\mathbf{Q}(\sqrt{d})$, and every complex extension being a $\mathbf{Q}(\sqrt{-d})$, with $d$ a positive integer. What about $p$-adic fields ? If $F$ is a finite extension of degree $d$ of $\mathbf{Q}_p$, how many quadratic extension $E/F$ are there ? Krasner seems to have given an explicit formula for coutning such extensions of degree $n$, but I hope there is an easier way to reach the answer for $n=2$. If $x$ is in $E \backslash F$, $E = F(x)$. We can suppose $x = \sqrt{a}$ for an $a \in F$, what can be seen as in the real or rational case by factorizing the minimal polynomial (of degree 2) of $x$. We can also suppose it squarefree, for each square factor do not change the extension over $F$. For $\pi$ a uniformizer, every element can be written $x = \pi^r u$ with $u \in O_F$ an integer of $F$, hence quadratic extensions are of the form $E = F(\sqrt{u})$ or $E = F(\sqrt{\pi u})$, with $u$ squarefree unit. Hence quadratic extensions are parametrized by squarefree units, that is $O_F/O_F^2$, that is the kernel of $x \mapsto x^2$, and hence of cardinal 1 or 2 ?

Exercise: Find all natural $n$ such that $3^{2n+1}-4^{n+1}+6^n$ is prime. Motivation: I'm trying to prepare talented elementary school children for mathematics competition and the question from the title popped up somewhere as suggested for the purpose (explicitly stating this should be number theory exercise for elementary school). Now, this immediately rang some alarms, as powers are learned in grade 8 (final grade before high school), when they certainly don't know any modular arithmetic or induction, let alone more advanced number theory. I tried to solve it anyway to see if this could actually be used, but to my surprise, I couldn't. Obviously, when $n=1$ we get $17$, which is prime, but for $n>1$ it seems that it will never be prime again, although I fail to show it (computer says that the expression is never prime in range $n\in[2, 100000000]$). There is, of course, possibility of a typo in question, but computer check up makes me believe that this is ""legit"" question. My work: First of all, for $n=1$ we have $3^{2n+1}-4^{n+1}+6^n = 17$ which is prime. Secondly, it is easy enough to check that for $n = 2k,\ k\in\mathbb N$ we have $5\mid 3^{2n+1}-4^{n+1}+6^n$. This looked promising, but for $n = 5$, we get $3^{2n+1}-4^{n+1}+6^n = 211\cdot 857$ as prime decomposition which is definitely worrisome. I tried to find some appropriate $d\in\mathbb N$ such that $n = qd + r$ to build some casework with respect to $r$, but had no luck. What I did notice is that if you pick $n$ in some non-trivial ideal $(d)$, there is at least one prime $p_d$ such that $p_d\mid 3^{2n+1}-4^{n+1}+6^n$, for all $n\in (d)$. (though, I proved this only for $d=2$, for $d>2$ this is but a computer inspired conjecture) Here is a table: \begin{array}{c | c} d & p_d \\ \hline 2 & 5 \\ 3 & 19 \\ 4 & 5, 13 \\ 5 & 211 \\ 6 & 5, 7, 19 \\ 7 & 29, 71 \\ 8 & 5, 13, 97 \\ 9 & 19, 1009 \\ 10 & 5, 11, 211\\ \end{array} Another attempt was obviously to try to factor $3^{2n+1}-4^{n+1}+6^n$ directly.

We give a completely elementary proof simply working in the ring $\mathbb{C}[t]$ and using that it is a UFD. Suppose there are some solutions of$$a(t)^3 + b(t)^3 = c(t)^3$$in $\mathbb{C}[t]$. Choose a solution $(a(t), b(t), c(t))$ such that the maximum $m > 0$ of the degrees of $a$, $b$, $c$ is minimal possible among all solutions. Clearly, this choice ensures that $a(t)$, $b(t)$, $c(t)$ are coprime.

Now, we look at the factors $c(t) - b(t)$, $c(t) - \omega b(t)$. Suppose that they have a common factor $q(t)$.

83,Solving the equation $ x^2-7y^2=-3 $ over integers,Solving the equation  over integers, x^2-7y^2=-3 ,"I'd like to solve the following Pell equation: $$ x^2-7y^2=-3 $$ Where $x$ and $y$ are integers. I applied the usual procedure, which avoids continued fractions: The two minimal positive integer solutions are $(x_0,y_0)=(2,1)$ and $(x_1,y_1)=(5,2)$, thus the minimal rational solution of $x^2-7y^2=1$ should be $(p,q)=\left(\frac{4}{3},\frac{1}{3}\right)$. My script (it is in german so I don't link it here) tells me, that in this case, every pair of solutions is given by: $$ x_{n+1}=\frac{4}{3}x_{n}+7\cdot\frac{1}{3}y_n \\ y_{n+1}=\frac{1}{3}x_{n}+\frac{4}{3}y_n $$ If we proceed further, we can find that this gives: $$ x_n=\frac{a_n}{3^n} \space\text{where}\space a_0=2,\space a_1=15,\space a_{n+1}=8a_n-9a_{n-1} \\ y_n=\frac{b_n}{3^n} \space\text{where}\space b_0=1,\space b_1=6,\space b_{n+1}=8b_n-9b_{n-1} $$ But if we take these equations modulo $9$, we see that $(2,1)$ and $(5,2)$ are the only integer solution, but there surely is also $(37,14)$. Where did I go wrong? Every answer will be appreciated, but I'm not used to the approach with continued fractions, so preferably I would like to see an answer avoiding this.
