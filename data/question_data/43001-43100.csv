It is easy to show that, given a multiplication with unity and an invertible element , the formula does indeed define another multiplication with unity (checking the axioms is straighforward); but so far I've struggled to prove the converse, mostly because the two multiplications don't seem to interact with each other at all. I don't even know whether this is in fact true but couldn't construct counterexamples in the more familiar rings either. P.S. My algebraic structure of interest is also commutative with respect to so it's ok if the proof has to rely on that (but not all elements it contains are invertible, I would have called it a field otherwise; neither do I know anything about zero divisors in it). Also, if the hypothesis is not true, maybe it can somehow be strenghtened to work?","∀A,B∈R:\ \ A*B=A\mathcal{J}^{-1}B R (+) (·) \mathcal{I} (∗) \mathcal{J}≠\mathcal{I} \mathcal{J} (·) ∃!\mathcal{J}^{-1}∈R:\ \ \mathcal{J}^{-1}\mathcal{J}=\mathcal{I} (·) \mathcal{I} \mathcal{J} A*B=A\mathcal{J}^{-1}B (∗) \mathcal{J} (·)","['abstract-algebra', 'ring-theory']"

63,"""Natural"" categories where monomorphisms differ from injective morphisms","""Natural"" categories where monomorphisms differ from injective morphisms",,"I started reading Algebra Chapter 0 on my own, and ran into the definition of a monomorphism for a category. My initial thought was that this was simply the same as the definition of injective. However, it seems at this point in the book, he has not defined injectivity for morphisms in general, only for functions between sets. In the functions between sets case, monomorphisms are injective functions. However, in general it looks like monomorphisms are a weaker than injective morphism. Monomorphisms seems to be ""left cancelable"" whereas injectivity suggests there is another morphism that forces the morphism to be ""left cancelable"". As I said, injective morphism has not been defined, but I would say the definition in my head is a morphism $f \in \text{Hom}_C(A, B)$ is injective if there exists $g \in \text{Hom}_C(B, A)$ such that $gf = 1_A$. The definition of monomorphism given is $f \in \text{Hom}_C(A, B)$ is a monomorphism if for $\alpha', \alpha'' \in \text{Hom}_C(Z, A)$ we have $f\alpha' = f\alpha''$ implies $\alpha'= \alpha''$. Clearly an injective morphism is a monomorphism, but the converse seems likely false. My counter example is a category with two objects $A, B$ with a single morphism $f \in \text{Hom}_C(A, B)$ (and of course the identity morphisms for $A$ and $B$). The composition rule will be easy since I can only compose $f$ with identity morphisms. Now $f$ is clearly a monomorphism since the only thing $\alpha'$ and $\alpha''$ can be in the definition is $1_A$, thus necessarily the same. But $f$ is definitely not injective, as there is no morphism at all in $\text{Hom}_C(B, A).$ This counter example feels really contrived. Most the categories I know about seem to behave much like category of sets with functions as morphisms, i.e. monomorphisms are injective morphisms. Is there an example of a category that we deal with all the time (even though we might not call it a category in polite company) where the monomorphisms are not necessarily injective? Thanks!

Is $J$ a prime ideal? Now, I know a theorem that states that $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt n]/p\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt n]$ (p: prime) is a field (hence $p\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt n]$ is a maximal and therefore a prime ideal) if and only if there is no $a\in\mathbb{Z}$ such that $$a^2\equiv n\mod p$$ and in that case, $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt n]/p\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt n]$ has $p^2$ elements. In my case the previous theorem does not work because for $6\in\mathbb{Z}$ I got $6^2\equiv 2\mod 17$ so am a bit confused. ps. This is my first post, so accept my apologies for any mistakes i've made. ps2. Sorry for my english.",,"['abstract-algebra', 'ideals', 'finite-rings']"

79,Determine the degree of the splitting field for $f(x)=x^{15}-1$.,Determine the degree of the splitting field for .,f(x)=x^{15}-1,"Let $f(x)= x^{15} - 1$ . Let $L$ be the splitting field of $f(x)$ over the field $K$ . Determine the extension degree $[L:K]$ in each case. a) $K= \Bbb{R}$ b) $K= \Bbb{Q}$ c) $K = \Bbb{F}_2$ d) $K = \Bbb{F}_{31}$ a) If we let $\Psi_d(x)$ denote the dth cyclotomic polynomial, then we have, $$x^{15}-1= \Psi_{d|15}(x) = \Psi(x) \Psi_3(x) \Psi_5(x) = (x-1)(x^2+x+1)(x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1)$$ So the roots of $f(x)$ are $1, \zeta_3, \zeta_3^2, \zeta_5, \zeta_5^2, \zeta_5^3, \zeta_5^4$ where $\zeta_k$ denotes the kth primitive root of unity. So the splitting field is $L=\Bbb{R}(\zeta_3, \zeta_5)$ . We know that $$[L:\Bbb{R}] = [L: \Bbb{R}(\zeta_5)][\Bbb{R}(\zeta_5): \Bbb{R}]$$ Since $x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1 \in \Bbb{R}[x]$ , we just need to check if we can factorize it into polynomials of lower degree. Of course, we cannot reduce it into polynomials of degrees 1 and 3, since we would then have a complex number in the reals. So we just need to check if we can reduce it into quadratic polynomials. Since $x^4+x^3+x^2+1=(x-\zeta_5)(x-\zeta_5^2)(x-\zeta_5^3)(x-\zeta_5^4)$ . By multiplying $(x-\zeta_5^t)$ and $(x-\zeta_5^w)$ for $w,t=0,1,2,3,4$ and $w \not= t$ , we find that we can reduce it into quadratics $(x-\zeta_5)(x-\zeta_5^4) = x^2 - (\zeta_5 + \zeta_5^4)x + 1$ and $(x-\zeta_5^2)(x - \zeta_5^3) = x^2 - (\zeta_5^3 + \zeta_5^2) + 1$ . We know that $\zeta_5 + \zeta_5^4$ and $\zeta_5^3 + \zeta_5^2$ are real but looking at the unit circle, because it is symmetric with respect to the horizontal axis, and so we end up on that axis. So $[L: \Bbb{R}(\zeta_5):\Bbb{R}]=2$ since the minimal polynomial over $\Bbb{R}$ is $x^2-(\zeta_5+\zeta_5^4)x+1$ . Now we need to compute $[L:\Bbb{R}(\zeta_5)]$ . Since $x^2+x+1$ is the minimal polynomial for $\zeta_3$ over $\Bbb{R}$ and since $\Bbb{R} \subseteq \Bbb{R}(\zeta_5)$ , we just need to check if $x^2+x+1$ has any linear factors in $\Bbb{R}(\zeta_5)$ . However, that would imply $\zeta_3 \in \Bbb{R}(\zeta_5)$ , which is not true. So $[L:\Bbb{R}]=4$ b) We just do the same thing, except that we cannot reduce the polynomial $x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1$ , because $x^2-(\zeta_5 + \zeta_5^4) + 1 \not\in \Bbb{Q}[x]$ , since $$\zeta_5 + \zeta_5^4 = \cos(2\pi/5) + i\sin(2\pi/5) + \cos(8\pi/5) + \sin(8\pi/5) = 2\cos(2\pi/5).$$ So $[L:\Bbb{R}]=8$ . c) For $x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1$ , we check if it has linear factors in $\Bbb{F}_2$ by plugging in 0 and 1. Since there aren't any, we just need to check if it has a quadratic as a factor. Since $x^2+1=(x+1)^2$ , we just need to check if $x^2+x+1$ is a factor, and we find that it isn't. For $x^2+x+1$ (polynomial for $\zeta_3$ ), we just need to check if it has linear factors, and it doesn't. So $[L:\Bbb{F}_2]=8$ d) I can do what I did with $\Bbb{F}_2$ , but that seems like it would take a long time, since there are 31 elements. It will also take a very long time trying to figure out the irreducible quadratics to see if they would divide $x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1$ . So I was wondering if there was a simpler way to do this or if I had to do it the long way... Are the other three correct? Thanks in advance","Let . Let be the splitting field of over the field .

But with $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$ it immediately follows that for : $(1\pm\sqrt{-5})= 2(a+b\sqrt{-5})$ $2b = \pm 1$. So 2 is not a prime in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$. Assume that 3 is a prime in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}$, then: $(1\pm \sqrt{-5}) = 3(a+b\sqrt{-5}) \Rightarrow 3b= \pm 1$ it follows that 3 is not a prime in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$. Assume that $1\pm \sqrt{-5}$ is a prime in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$, then: $3 = (1\pm \sqrt{-5})(a+b\sqrt{-5}) \Rightarrow (1\pm \sqrt{-5} )a = 3$ which is not solvable in $\mathbb{Z}$. And also $2=(1\pm \sqrt{-5})(a+b\sqrt{-5})=(1\pm \sqrt{-5})a$ which is also not solvable in $\mathbb{Z}$ and thus $(1\pm \sqrt{-5})$ can not be a prime in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$. Tell me if this proof is correct. Please.","Show that $2,3, 1-\sqrt{-5}, 1+\sqrt{-5}$ are irreducible over $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$, but not prime and that 1 and -1 are the only units. Let $N$ be the norm map into $\mathbb{Z}$ and let u denote the unit, then because it is a homomorphism it follows that : $N(xy)=N(x)N(y)$ and thus with $N(u)N(u^{-1})=N(uu^{-1})=N(1)$ it follows that the norm of u is a divider of 1 and thus also a unit of $\mathbb{Z}$. Therefore we have in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$: $\forall a,b \in \mathbb{Z}: N(a+b\sqrt{-5})=(a+b\sqrt{-5})(a-b\sqrt{-5})=a^{2}+5b^{2}=1 \ \ \Rightarrow u= \pm 1$ Now it is to show that $2,3,1-\sqrt{-5}, 1+\sqrt{-5}$ are irreducible over $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]: $ Assume $1-\sqrt{-5}$ is reducible, then there must exist $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$ so that $N(1-\sqrt{-5})=N(a)N(b) \Rightarrow N(a)=N(b)= \pm (1-\sqrt{-5})$ But since $1-\sqrt{-5}$ is not a quadratic remainder of $5$, there doesn't exist a solution for the equations $a^{2}+5b^{2}= \pm (1-\sqrt{-5})$ And the exactly same argument also works for $2,3$ and $1+\sqrt{-5}$. Thus we have shown that $2,3,1\pm \sqrt{-5}$ are not reducible over $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$. Now we show that they are not prime: Assume that 2 is a prime in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$, then because of $2\cdot 3 = (1-\sqrt{-5})(1+\sqrt{-5})=6$ it must hold that $2|(1-\sqrt{-5})$ or $2|(1+\sqrt{-5})$. But with $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$ it immediately follows that for : $(1\pm\sqrt{-5})= 2(a+b\sqrt{-5})$ $2b = \pm 1$. So 2 is not a prime in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$. Assume that 3 is a prime in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}$, then: $(1\pm \sqrt{-5}) = 3(a+b\sqrt{-5}) \Rightarrow 3b= \pm 1$ it follows that 3 is not a prime in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$. Assume that $1\pm \sqrt{-5}$ is a prime in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$, then: $3 = (1\pm \sqrt{-5})(a+b\sqrt{-5}) \Rightarrow (1\pm \sqrt{-5} )a = 3$ which is not solvable in $\mathbb{Z}$. And also $2=(1\pm \sqrt{-5})(a+b\sqrt{-5})=(1\pm \sqrt{-5})a$ which is also not solvable in $\mathbb{Z}$ and thus $(1\pm \sqrt{-5})$ can not be a prime in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$.

In the next case, $\mathbb{Z}_{p^m}$ is cyclic, let's say it's generated by $c$. Then $f(c)$ has order $p^m$. So $ker g$ has order $p^m$. Therefore $A$ has to have at least order $p^{n+m}$.

This is already monic, so to show that this is a minimal polynomial I only need to show that it is irreducible. Edit: To do that, I can use the Eisenstein: $p=2$ does not divide $a_1 = 1$ and $p^2$ does not divide $a_0 = -2$, therefore it is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$. (ii): This time, $\sqrt[4]{2}i$ is a root of $f(x) = x^2+\sqrt{2}$. For polynomials of degree two it's enough to check if they have a root. The only roots this one has are complex therefore it is irreducible over $\mathbb{R}$ and therefore the minimal polynomial. So my more general question is: is the way to find a minimal polynomial of an element $a$ in general to find a polynomial $f$ such that $f(a) = 0$ and then to norm $f$ and then to show that $f$ is irreducible?
