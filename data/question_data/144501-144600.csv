Hence, the limit must be $0$ . It is obviously problematic. And what I thought is that make prefect square under the limit, though I know the right solution is to rationalize the numerator.

Let $\mathbb a_n$ be a sequence of strictly positive real numbers such that $\sum_{n\in\mathbb N}a_n$ is finite, i.e., the limit $\lim_{k\to\infty}\sum_{n=1}^ka_n$ exists. Then $a_n$ has to converge to zero, pretty quickly so. -- That much I do remember. Does it follow that $\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n\cdot n=0$ has to hold? Here is what I do (seem to) remember: If the limit exists, then $a_n$ has to converge to zero, ``quicker'' than $1/n$, thus(???), there has to exist some $\epsilon>0$ such that $a_n$ goes to zero as fast as  $(1/n)^{1+\epsilon}$. --- But is this true? If this is in fact true, then $\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n\cdot n = 0$ does hold.",,"['calculus', 'sequences-and-series', 'limits']"

Thanks!,This question already has answers here : Proof of Convergence: Babylonian Method $x_{n+1}=\frac{1}{2}(x_n + \frac{a}{x_n})$ (9 answers) Closed 3 years ago . Let $x_1=1$ and $$x_{n+1} = \frac12\left(x_n + \frac2{x_n}\right).$$ Prove or disprove $(x_n)$ is convergent and show the limit. When I tried working on it I found the sequence was bounded by square root of 2 and it is was monotone. But apparently the sequence is not bounded by square root of two and is not monotone. But I have no idea why. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!,,"['calculus', 'sequences-and-series', 'limits', 'convergence-divergence']"

By the definition of accumulation point, for all $\epsilon>0$ we have that $N^*(x;\epsilon)\cap S\neq \varnothing$.
