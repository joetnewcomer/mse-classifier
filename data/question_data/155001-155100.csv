0,Classifying Diophantine Equations,Classifying Diophantine Equations,,"Take a given Diophantine equation. Chances are, we can't find any solutions. But if it's an equation of a certain form, we may get lucky and may be able not only to find a solution, but be able to classify all the solutions of such an equation. I'm preparing a talk on Diophantine Equations. I'm interested in exploring how the difficulty of Diophantine equations increase as both the number of variables and the degree of the equation increases. Of course, due to Matiyasevich's resolution of Hilbert's Tenth Problem, we know that no general algorithm to determine whether or not a given Diophantine Equation has a solution. Here's my current understanding of the ""frontier"" of Diophantine Equations: Variables $=1$, Degree $=n$: The solutions are completely determined by the Rational Root Theorem. Once you have all the rational roots, just look for the roots that are also integers. Variables $=k$, Degree $=1$: The equation is of the form $$a_1 x_1 + ... + a_k x_k = d.$$ This has solutions if and only if the greatest common divisor of $a_1,...,a_k$ divides $d$, and in that case, we have a nice formula parametrising the solutions (which I won't repeat here). Variables $=2$, Degree $=2$: There exist solutions to an equation $P(x,y)$ if and only if we have: 1) There exist solutions to $P(x,y) \mod n$ for all integers $n$ (so in practise, you just need to verify there exists solutions $\mod p$ for all primes $p$, and then by Hensel's Lemma, and the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we have solutions for all $n$. 2) There exist real solutions to $P(x,y)$ If we can find one solution, we can find all rational solutions through stereographic projection. Once you have all rational solutions, look at the solutions where the denominator divides the numerator to get all the integer solutions. Variables $=2$, Degree $=3$: This is handled by elliptic curves. Broadly speaking, provided that the equation is ""nice enough"", the set of solutions to the Diophantine equation has an abelian group structure. This consists of a torsion free part, which can be one of 16 possible groups, and a torsion free part, which looks like $\mathbb{Z}^r$ for some natural number $r$. The $r$ here is called the rank of an elliptic curve, and computing it is, in general, computationally difficult. Variables $\geq 2$, Degree $\geq 4$: In general, this is no man's land. Of course, some equations we may have luck with (take $x^4 + y^4 = z^4$; there is an elementary proof that this has no solutions in the natural numbers), but in general, you're probably out of luck. The other two types of Diophantine equations that I haven't spoken about are exponential Diophantine equations (such as Catalan's conjecture: $x^a - y^b =1$ only has one solutions, namely $x=3, a = 2, y=2, b=3$), and infinite Diophantine equations. These are even more intractable, so I won't touch on these at all. My question is, in my above analysis, have I missed out anything obvious/is there anything glaringly wrong?","Take a given Diophantine equation. Chances are, we can't find any solutions.

9,Irreducibility of cyclotomic polynomials via schemes,Irreducibility of cyclotomic polynomials via schemes,,"A few months ago, someone told me there existed a scheme theoretic proof of the irreducibility of cyclotomic polynomials. I've tried coming up with a proof, and when that didn't really yield anything $($just the scattered thoughts I have below$)$, I searched online for a reference to a proof, to no avail. Can anyone provide a proof or a reference to one? Does a proof even exist via schemes, or was this someone trolling me? Would this question be a better fit on MathOverflow? Here are my thoughts so far on such a proof, if it were to exist. The standard linear algebraic $($or in context of ""modern"" frameworks, the ""$p$-adic""$)$ formulation of the irreducibility of cyclotomic polynomials is as follows. Theorem. Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$. The degree of $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_n)/\mathbb{Q}$ is $[\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_n):\mathbb{Q}] = \phi(n)$. This is saying is that the vector space generated by the powers of $\zeta_n$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ is of dimension $\phi(n)$. The most important case in the proof is where $n = p$, where one shows that the $\mathbb{Q}$-vector space $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_p)$ has dimension $p-1$. This is done by showing $$\dim_\mathbb{Q}(\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_p)) = \dim_\mathbb{Z}(\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_p]) = \dim_{\mathbb{F}_p}(\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_p]/p),$$and that $\dim_{\mathbb{F}_p}(\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_p]/p) = p-1$. Now, the purpose of scheme theory is to make geometry out of rings. In the case of this elusive proof, I imagine the scheme theoretic perspective claims that the extension of rings $\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_n]/\mathbb{Z}$ is like a ramified cover of topological spaces. One imagines $\mathbb{Z}$ as space populated by its primes, and similarly for $\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_n]$. The scheme theoretic restatement of the above theorem is that this is a connected cover of degree $\phi(n)$. In the standard proof of the linear algebraic formulation above one sees this by looking above the prime $p$, where one sees ""nilpotency"" of order $p-1$, which implies that the cover must have degree $p-1$. Is this viable? Should I use some sort of monodromy or something? $($But that's harder to make sense of in the arithmetic setting...$)$","A few months ago, someone told me there existed a scheme theoretic proof of the irreducibility of cyclotomic polynomials. I've tried coming up with a proof, and when that didn't really yield anything $($just the scattered thoughts I have below$)$, I searched online for a reference to a proof, to no avail. Can anyone provide a proof or a reference to one? Does a proof even exist via schemes, or was this someone trolling me? Would this question be a better fit on MathOverflow? Here are my thoughts so far on such a proof, if it were to exist. The standard linear algebraic $($or in context of ""modern"" frameworks, the ""$p$-adic""$)$ formulation of the irreducibility of cyclotomic polynomials is as follows. Theorem. Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$. The degree of $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_n)/\mathbb{Q}$ is $[\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_n):\mathbb{Q}] = \phi(n)$. This is saying is that the vector space generated by the powers of $\zeta_n$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ is of dimension $\phi(n)$. The most important case in the proof is where $n = p$, where one shows that the $\mathbb{Q}$-vector space $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_p)$ has dimension $p-1$. This is done by showing $$\dim_\mathbb{Q}(\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_p)) = \dim_\mathbb{Z}(\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_p]) = \dim_{\mathbb{F}_p}(\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_p]/p),$$and that $\dim_{\mathbb{F}_p}(\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_p]/p) = p-1$.

11,How to list the prime factorised natural numbers?,How to list the prime factorised natural numbers?,,"Today I set out to invent a two character numeral system designed to make factorization trivial. Indeed, it lets one factor non-trivial numbers with over thousand digits within 30 seconds per hand - the upshot is that the notation isn't particularly suited for arithmetic. In fact, when I try to add certain two digit numbers, my computer gives me an overflow warning. The idea is to not use any base like binary or decimal, as in $28=2\cdot 10^1+8\cdot 10^0$, but to hardcode the prime factors $28=2^2\cdot 3^0 \cdot 5^0 \cdot 7^1$ into the notation. So denote the start and end of a number by ""$s$"" and ""$e$"". I set $0:=se$ and declare a natural number to be any string of the form ""$sxe$"" where $x$ is a finite string of numbers. The $n$'th number in the sequence $x$ denotes the power oth the $n$'th prime number and ""$sxe$"" is the associated product. So from an ordinal point of view $1=2^0=s0e=ssee$ $2=2^1=s1e=ssseee$ $3=2^0\cdot 3^1=s01e=ssesseee$ $4=2^2=s2e=sssseeee$ $5=2^0\cdot 3^0\cdot 5^1=s001e=ssesesseee$ ... $28=2^2\cdot 3^0 \cdot 5^0 \cdot 7^1=s2001e=sssseeesesesseee$ I came to the conclusion that the language consists of all the strings with equal number of $s$'s and $e$'s, where while scanning from the left there are always more $s$'s than $e$'s and the substring $esee$ isn't allowed. The first condition makes sure that all numbers close and the second one disallows superfluous factor of powers of 0. I've written a script which brute force generates these strings (it forms all permutations of even numbers of $s$'s and $e$'s and then drops the disallowed ones) and also one to translate them to decimal expression (which relies on knowing what the $n$'th prime is): http://pastebin.com/RwkGX6TV This e.g tells me that 2417851639229258349412352 is sssesssseeeeee and the nice thing is that all numbers factor easily: $sssesssseeeeee$ $= s(s(se)(s(s(s(se)e)e)e)e)e$ $=s(s0(s(s(s0e)e)e)e)e$ $=s(s0(s(s1e)e)e)e$ $=s(s0(s2e)e)e$ $=s(s0(2^2)e)e$ $=s(2^0\cdot 3^{2^2})e$ $=2^{3^{2^2}}.$ For now, I've generated most of the numbers with 20 characters and I've added an artificial bound of $R=10^{50}$ to the size of the exponents. This is necessary, as e.g. the number $13$, being the $6$th prime, reads $ssesesesesesseee$, i.e. $s000001e$ but it's neighbors in this enumeration can be numbers with thousands of digits. Generating the strings is simple down at $14$ but multiplication is hard. Later, also higher number of strings are needed and the way I produce the permutation is probably inefficient. To generate a bigger library of numbers, I'd like to know if someone has an idea for a less arbitrary enumeration of the the strings which avoid the uncomputably big numbers.

I was aware of the difficulty in proving various constants to be transcendental -- such as $e + \pi$, which is not known to be transcendental at present. However, I was looking at a question that seems simpler, naively: whether a number is an integer, rather than whether it is transcendental.  It seems that what appeared to be possibly simpler is actually not, with current techniques. The main motivation for asking about this particular number is that it is very large. It is certainly possible to find a pair of very large numbers, at least one of which is transcendental.

So I define $F(n)=\sum_{d\mid n}f(d)$. By Moebius inversion, $$ f(n)=\sum_{d\mid n}\mu(d)F(n/d). $$ The sum in question is the case where $n=p-1$, so $$ f(p-1)=\sum_{d\mid p-1}\mu(p-1)F((p-1)/d) $$ and I want to show this is congruent to $\mu(p-1)\pmod{p}$. Since $f(1)=1$, $F(1)=1$, so I'm just trying to show $F((p-1)/d)\equiv 0$ when $(p-1)/d\neq 1$ and I believe the result would follow. Does anyone know how to show that if it is true, or fix the argument otherwise?",,"['number-theory', 'mobius-inversion']"

I could then prove that $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a PID, so Euclid's lemma holds, and then see that $p\mid (x+i)$ or $p\mid (x-i)$, using the fact that $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a PID, so if $p$ is irreducible, then $p$ is prime.
