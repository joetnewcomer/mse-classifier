My formula can still be correct, because it doesnt depend on the Truth false of LHS when LHS itself is false, just that Mathematical induction is not able to prove it ?","I saw this to be the rule of inference for mathematical induction : Now consider : as L.H.S. and as R.H.S. . Now if suppose, while trying to prove P(k) -> P(k+1) , in the left hand side of the expression, comes out to be false for some case, then the whole left hand side becomes false. But A -> B just imposes a condition that whenever A is true, B must also be true. There is no boundation on B when A is false. That means even if my LHS is False, RHS could be True!. And hence, Mathematical induction can only be used to prove something, and not disprove ? Is my argument correct ? If someone could throw more light please ?

Clearly there are $2^{100}$ possible subsets of $X$, so iterating through them would take too long. Does anyone know of, or can anyone think of, some sort of dynamic programming solution or other feasible algorithm?","Given a 64-bit positive integer $y$ and a set of $100$ $64$-bit positive integers: $X = \{ x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{100} \}$ I want to find a smallest possible $Z = \{z_1, z_2, \dots, z_n\}   \subset X$, such that: $$\begin{align} y = z_1 ⊕ z_2 ⊕ \dots ⊕ z_n \end{align}$$ if such a $Z$ exists.

Is it correct if I simplify it to: $X= \iiint f(a,b,c)\textrm{ d}a\textrm{ d}b\textrm{ d}c + 3x^2\iint f(a,a,b)\textrm{ d}a\textrm{ d}b + x^3\int f(a,a,a)\textrm{ d}a$ ?

99,determine the max flow function $f^*$ in a network given the maximum flow value,determine the max flow function  in a network given the maximum flow value,f^*,"Suppose I have a Network N ( i.e. just a Digraph D(A,V) with A=Arcs, V=Vertices; combined with a capacity function $c:V x V \to \mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$ and two vertices s:=source, t:=sink singled out) I call $f:V x V \to \mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$ a flow if it does not exceed capacity for any pair (u,v) and the net flow at any vertex is zero expect at the source and sink where a net flow is allowed. Now suppose I have a way of knowing the value of the maximum flow (this value just being the maximum flow $$\sum_{(s,v)\in A} f(source,v)$$ out of the source in any legal flow f. Similarly this value will equal the max total flow into the sink in any flow) I am wondering whether there is a clever way to determine the actual flow function say $f^*$ given that I know what the maximum flow value is ? If I had a way of knowing what the value of such a maximum flow is for any network N at no extra ""cost"" would this give me a more efficient way ?
