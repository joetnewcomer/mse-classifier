1,Recurrence relation on a set of integers. Do we have $v_{n+q} = \sum_{j=0}^{q-1}\lambda_{j}v_{n+j}$?,Recurrence relation on a set of integers. Do we have ?,v_{n+q} = \sum_{j=0}^{q-1}\lambda_{j}v_{n+j},"Order the set of positive integers of the form $2^{a}3^{b}$ $(a,b \in \mathbb{N}\cup\{0\})$ as $v_{1}<v_{2}<...$ .

I'm an amateur recreational mathematician. But I've been looking at the Twin Prime Conjecture lately, because it is so fascinating. Easy enough for an 8-year-old to understand, but perplexing mathematicians for millennia. As a science teacher, the whole preponderance-of-empirical-evidence thing seems reasonable enough... but of course, not for mathematicians. I have no delusion I'll prove anything, but maybe I can contribute something useful? And I have a weird result that may or may not be useful, that I also can't explain. In relation to the TPC, I've been working on a sieve that generates This OEIS sequence , the numbers for which $6k \pm 1$ are both prime. I'm trying to build off of the work of Dinculescu's various papers (one linked, others at the OEIS link). The TPC is the conjecture that this sequence is infinite. What does this have to do with Euler products? I've been working with the following one: $$\prod_{5 \leq p \leq n} \left(1-\frac2p\right)$$ Simple enough. It starts at 5 because it's looking at twin primes, and has a 2 in there because the sieve removes $\frac2p$ of $\mathbb{N}$ each pass. There are a lot of constants that can be calculated using Euler products . The one I'm working with above isn't one of them, or even similar. So I poked around a bit. Merten's 3rd theorem says this: $$\lim_{n \to \infty}\ln n\prod_{p \leq n} \left(1 - \frac1p \right) = e^{-\gamma}$$ This theorem seemed interesting to me because the Euler product portion is basically the leftovers in $\mathbb{N}$ after $n$ iterations of the Sieve of Eratosthenes. As $n \to \infty$ , the ""leftover"" set is just $\mathbb{P}$ . So, the Sieve of Eratosthenes diverges to zero (as we'd expect since the density of $\mathbb{P}$ is zero), but when multiplied by $\ln n$ , it converges. That's a pretty cool trick! For the heck of it, I tried multiplying the iterations of my product by $\ln n$ to see what came out, which was still divergence to zero, uninteresting. So I looked at Hardy and Littlewood and noticed their constant ends up with an $(\ln n)^2$ term when calculating $\pi_2(n)$ . Since my product diverges to zero about twice as fast as Mertens's, I decided to try that out, and I got something that converged! And I tried to figure out if the value it converged to ( $\approx 2.49726$ ) was a known constant. After some trial and error I found: $$\lim_{n \to\infty} (\ln n)^2 \prod_{5 \leq p \leq n} \left(1-\frac2p\right) \approx 4\lambda$$ Where $\lambda$ is... the Golomb-Dickman constant, something I'd never heard of. (This is by empricial computer calculation only, but it converges to four digits with about 6 million primes.)

20,Did Gauss know Jacobi's four squares theorem?,Did Gauss know Jacobi's four squares theorem?,,"This is a question that I have already asked on HSM stackexchange, and I decided to ask it again here because it is more mathematical than historic (to make a conclusion in this question one needs more mathematical then historical understanding). In p. 283-285 of volume 2 of Dickson's “history of the theory of numbers” appear several formulas of striking similarity: some of them are stated by Gauss (p.283) and some are stated by Jacobi (p.285); they are actually the same and only the notation differs ( $x$ in Gauss's formula and $q$ in Jacobi's formula). Gauss's formulas are the following identities on the 4th power of the theta function: $(\sum_{-\infty}^\infty q^{{n^2}})^4 = (\sum_{-\infty}^\infty (-1)^n q^{{n^2}})^4 + (\sum_{-\infty}^\infty q^{{(2n - 1)^2/4}})^4 = 1 + 8\sum_{1\le m} \frac {{mq^m}}{{1 - (-1)^{m + 1}q^m}} = 1 + \sum_{1 \le m}\hat \sigma (k)q^k$ The point is that the last equality means that the coefficients of the $k$ th power in the right side of the last equallity must be equal to $r_4(k)$ (number of representations of $k$ as sum of $4$ squares), and an additonal interpretation (by certain manipulations) of the right side of the equallity gives the result of Jacobi: $r_4(k) = 8\sigma(k)$ or $24\sigma(k)$ , depends if k is odd or even. In the same passage from Gauss's nachlass (Werke, volume 3, p. 444-445, passage [9])  in which he writes down Jacobi's identity, and just before this identity, Gauss also writes down $\mathbb{log}(\vartheta_3^4(x))$ as: $$\mathbb{log}((1+2x+2x^4+2x^9+\cdots)^4) = 8\cdot (\frac{x}{1+x}+\frac{x^3}{3(1+x^3)}+\frac{x^5}{5(1+x^5)}+\cdots)$$ , (actually he writes down the series for $\frac{1}{2}\mathbb{log}(\vartheta_3(x))$ , but it is equivalent to what I wrote). Immediately after writing down several identities on the fourth powers of Jacobi theta functions $p,q,r$ , Gauss proceeds and writes a differential equation satisfied by new variables $t,u$ (defined by : $t = \frac{1}{p^2}, u  = \frac{1}{q^2}$ )  and their first, second and third derivatives (of $t,u$ ). Since I'm unfamiliar with the theory of modular forms, I'm unable to see how Gauss arrived at this identity for $\mathbb{log}(\vartheta_3^4(x))$ , nor I'm able to see how one can find the series developement of $\vartheta_3^4(x)$ from that of $\mathbb{log}(\vartheta_3^4(x))$ . But maybe some of the mathematicians here who are familiar with modular forms can see the connection. Update (July 23, 2022) The identity for $\mathbb{log}(\vartheta_3(x))$ can be derived on the basis of Jacobi triple product indentity; it is essensially an expansion of the logarithm into a linear combination of Lambert series by transforming the logarithm of the infinite product form of the theta function (which is a special case of Jacobi triple product) into an infinite sum of logarithms. A detailed derivation of it can be found in this post . But I believe the key to uncover the infinite series for $\vartheta^4_3(x)$ from that of $\mathbb{log}(\vartheta^4_3(x))$ is the differential equation Gauss writes at the end of passage 9 - he defines $t = \frac{1}{p^2}, u = \frac{1}{q^2}$ where $p = \vartheta_3(x), q = \vartheta_4(x)$ and then writes down several relations, and one of them is: $$\frac{u}{t}-\frac{t}{u}=2x(tu'-ut')$$ Rewriting it in terms of $p,q,r$ , one gets: $$\frac{p^2}{q^2}-\frac{q^2}{p^2}=2x(tu'-ut')\implies \frac{p^4-q^4}{p^2q^2}=2x(tu'-ut')\implies p^4-q^4 = 2p^2q^2x(tu'-ut') \implies r^4 = \frac{2x}{tu}(tu'-ut')\implies r^4 = 2x(\frac{u'}{u}-\frac{t'}{t})\implies r^4 = 2x(\mathbb{log}'(u) - \mathbb{log}'(t))\implies r^4 = x\mathbb{log'}(\frac{u^2}{t^2}) = x\mathbb{log}'(\frac{p^4}{q^4})$$ I dont know how to prove this differential equation, but this development shows that it connects the logarithm of ratio of theta functions with the fourth power of another theta function ( $r$ ), so this might be the original method Gauss used to arrive at the series for $\vartheta^4_3(x)$ . In addition, since $q(x) = p(-x)$ , the right side of the last equation, which is $$x(\mathbb{log}'(p(x)^4)-\mathbb{log}'(q(x)^4)) = x(\mathbb{log}'(p(x)^4)-\mathbb{log}'(p(-x)^4))$$ , can be calculated on the basis of the series expansion for $\mathbb{log}(p(x))$ .

The article appeared in 1996 in The Mathematical Intelligencer. I guess I should repeat that they point out that $x^4 + 3 x^2 + 7x + 4$ is reducible mod every prime. This has thrown me off, I had this idea that reducibility would mean that the homogeneous polynomial below, the norm form, would integrally represent low powers of that prime, especially $p$ or $p^2$ or $p^3.$ Something very much like that happened with these earlier questions, what numbers are integrally represented by this quartic polynomial (norm form) https://mathoverflow.net/questions/127160/numbers-integrally-represented-by-a-ternary-cubic-form/127295#127295 primes represented integrally by a homogeneous cubic form I thought I had something reasonable which is to take the companion matrix $$ A = \left( \begin{array}{rrrr} 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\  -4 & -7 & -3 & 0 \end{array} \right) $$ and create $$ f(x,y,z,t) = \det \left(  x  I + y A + z  A^2 + t A^3 \right)  $$ $$  f(x,y,z,t) =  x^4 + (-6z - 21t)x^3 + (3y^2 + (21z - 2t)y + (17z^2 + 21tz + 138t^2))x^2 + (-7y^3 + (-16z + 42t)y^2 + (-21z^2 - 99tz - 203t^2)y + (25z^3 + 28tz^2 + 139t^2z - 91t^3))x +  (4y^4 - 24ty^3 + (12z^2 + 84tz + 68t^2)y^2 + (-28z^3 - 64tz^2 - 84t^2z + 100t^3)y + (16z^4 + 48t^2z^2 - 112t^3z + 64t^4)) $$ Now, this is automatically completely multiplicative.

jagy@phobeusjunior:~$","This is from the polynomial example $x^4 + 3 x^2 + 7x + 4$ discussed in the framework of Chebotarev Density in Lenstra-Stevenhagen , especially pages 10,11,12 in this pdf. The article appeared in 1996 in The Mathematical Intelligencer. I guess I should repeat that they point out that $x^4 + 3 x^2 + 7x + 4$ is reducible mod every prime. This has thrown me off, I had this idea that reducibility would mean that the homogeneous polynomial below, the norm form, would integrally represent low powers of that prime, especially $p$ or $p^2$ or $p^3.$ Something very much like that happened with these earlier questions, what numbers are integrally represented by this quartic polynomial (norm form) https://mathoverflow.net/questions/127160/numbers-integrally-represented-by-a-ternary-cubic-form/127295#127295 primes represented integrally by a homogeneous cubic form I thought I had something reasonable which is to take the companion matrix $$ A = \left( \begin{array}{rrrr} 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\  -4 & -7 & -3 & 0 \end{array} \right) $$ and create $$ f(x,y,z,t) = \det \left(  x  I + y A + z  A^2 + t A^3 \right)  $$ $$  f(x,y,z,t) =  x^4 + (-6z - 21t)x^3 + (3y^2 + (21z - 2t)y + (17z^2 + 21tz + 138t^2))x^2 + (-7y^3 + (-16z + 42t)y^2 + (-21z^2 - 99tz - 203t^2)y + (25z^3 + 28tz^2 + 139t^2z - 91t^3))x +  (4y^4 - 24ty^3 + (12z^2 + 84tz + 68t^2)y^2 + (-28z^3 - 64tz^2 - 84t^2z + 100t^3)y + (16z^4 + 48t^2z^2 - 112t^3z + 64t^4)) $$ Now, this is automatically completely multiplicative.

The most obvious is the contfrac-command which requires a very large precision, if I want to calculate, lets say , $10^7$ entries. If the continued fraction expansion of $2^{1/3}$ is $[a_1,a_2,a_3,\cdots]$, then define $x_k:=[a_k,a_{k+1},a_{k+2},\cdots]$ I had the idea that I can calculate the minimal polynomials of the numbers $x_k$ (See the above definition).

But the coefficients of the minimal polynomial get soon extremely large, hence the program needs already much longer for the first $2\cdot 10^4$ entries than the cont-frac-command. Does anyone know a faster method with which I can calculate $10^7$ or $10^8$ entries in a reasonable time ?

34,"Is this Dirichlet ""$\eta$ version"" of the inverse relationship between $\zeta(s)$ and the Möbius function correct?","Is this Dirichlet "" version"" of the inverse relationship between  and the Möbius function correct?",\eta \zeta(s),"With $\mu(n)$ the Möbius function and $\zeta(s)$ the Riemann zeta function, it is well-known that: $$\frac 1{\zeta(s)}=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\mu(n)}{n^s}$$ that is proven to converge for $\Re(s)>1$ and might converge $\frac12 < \Re(s) <1$ (which is the RH). In a similar fashion as the Dirichlet $\eta$-function, I started to experiment with: $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(\frac{\mu(2n-1)}{(2n-1)^s}-\frac{\mu(2n)}{(2n)^s}\right)$$ and found that the following also seems to hold true: $$\frac 1{\zeta(s)}=\frac{2^s-1}{2^s+1}\cdot\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(\frac{\mu(2n-1)}{(2n-1)^s}-\frac{\mu(2n)}{(2n)^s}\right)$$ where $\frac{2^s-1}{2^s+1}$ could also be written as $\tanh\left(\frac{s\ln(2)}{2}\,\right)$.

So since we think (for centuries) that factorization of large numbers is a difficult problem, we assume that no one will be able to find $d$ in a reasonable amount of time, unless they know wich prime numbers form $n$. My questions are: I don't know if I understand that the requirement that $e$ is a prime   number. For me, any number would work in the process I described. Also, why $m$ is not assumed to be coprime with $n$ at $(2)$? Since   $m$ is the message, it can happen that $m$ is not coprime with $n$. In the wikipedia article , it says that $e$ must be less that   $\phi(n)$. Why? Why, in the wikipedia article where he proves it using fermat's   little theorem , it assumes that $ed$ is congruent to $1$ mod   $\phi(n)$?

Please be patient, I'll give time to choose the answers, so you guys have time to write a good one <3","I'm trying to understand the RSA cryptosystem, and that's what I know so far: If we think about some number $m$ as the message, then we are searching a $e$ and $d$ such that $$m^{ed} \equiv m \ \ (\mbox{mod} \ n)$$ So someone can encrypt the message by doing $$m^e \ \ (\mbox{mod} \ n)$$ And the person that holds $d$ can decrypt it by doing $$(m^e \ \ (\mbox{mod} \ n))^d (\mbox{mod}\ n) = m$$ *(not the best notation but you guys get the idea) $d$ can be calculated by using Euler's theorem, which states that: $$m^{\phi(n)}\equiv 1 \ (\mbox{mod} \ n) \tag{2}$$ where $m$ coprime with $n$ Then, by some modular arithmetic properties, we can do this in $(2)$: Raise both sides by $k$, so we get: $$m^{k\phi(n)}\equiv 1 \ (\mbox{mod} \ n)$$ *because $1^k$ is $1$ Then multiply both sides by $m$: $$m^{k\phi(n)+1}\equiv m \ (\mbox{mod} \ n)$$ By comparing this congruency with the one we've been searching: $$m^{k\phi(n)+1}\equiv m \ (\mbox{mod} \ n)$$ $$m^{ed} \equiv m \ \ (\mbox{mod} \ n)$$ We just need to solve for $d$ by doing: $$ed = k\phi(n)+1\implies d = \frac{k\phi(n)+1}{e}$$ So $d$ can be easely calculated if you know the factorization of $n$, because for a number $n$, $\phi(n)$ is $\phi(p)\phi(q)$ where $n = pq$ (in other words, $p$ and $q$ are the prime factors of $n$). So since we think (for centuries) that factorization of large numbers is a difficult problem, we assume that no one will be able to find $d$ in a reasonable amount of time, unless they know wich prime numbers form $n$. My questions are: I don't know if I understand that the requirement that $e$ is a prime   number. For me, any number would work in the process I described. Also, why $m$ is not assumed to be coprime with $n$ at $(2)$? Since   $m$ is the message, it can happen that $m$ is not coprime with $n$. In the wikipedia article , it says that $e$ must be less that   $\phi(n)$. Why? Why, in the wikipedia article where he proves it using fermat's   little theorem , it assumes that $ed$ is congruent to $1$ mod   $\phi(n)$?

Who can help me? The origin of the inequality is a regular magazine for high school teachers issued by P. Noordhoff since 1914 ( Nieuw Tijdschrift voor Wiskunde ). I considered various methods to prove the statement above. For instance using the fact that integers $n$ which are of the form $x^2+xy+y^2$ for two relatively prime integers $x,y$, are precisely those positive integers occurring as divisors of $m^2+m+1$ for some integer $m$. Another approach I tried is to consider the general solutions $x,y$ of $n=x^2+xy+y^2.$ An integer $n$ can be uniquely written as $n=sz^2$ with $s$ squarefree. Let $$\begin{align*} s=f^2+fg+g^2,&\quad z=m^2+mn+n^2;\\ x=(f+g)n^2+2gmn-fm^2,&\quad y=-gn^2+2fnm+(f+g)m^2\,. \end{align*}$$ Then we have $x^2+xy+y^2=(f^2 + fg + g^2)(m^2 + mn + n^2)^2$. The radical of $xy(x+y)(x^2+xy+y^2)$ has the form $xy(x+y)sz$, which leads to the (interesting) identity $$\bigl(xy(x+y)\bigr)sz\bigl(fg(f+g)\bigr)=sz\prod_{i=1}^3{(u_i^2-sn^2)}\,,$$ where $u_1=gn-fm$, $u_2=(f+g)m+fn$, and $u_3=gm+(f+g)n$. I also tried to use the following summation identity: let  $e>0$  be an integer and  $w=(-1)^e$. Choose $r=\frac{1}{3}(2^e-w)$ which is an integer.

Who can help me? The origin of the inequality is a regular magazine for high school teachers issued by P. Noordhoff since 1914 ( Nieuw Tijdschrift voor Wiskunde ). I considered various methods to prove the statement above. For instance using the fact that integers $n$ which are of the form $x^2+xy+y^2$ for two relatively prime integers $x,y$, are precisely those positive integers occurring as divisors of $m^2+m+1$ for some integer $m$. Another approach I tried is to consider the general solutions $x,y$ of $n=x^2+xy+y^2.$ An integer $n$ can be uniquely written as $n=sz^2$ with $s$ squarefree. Let $$\begin{align*} s=f^2+fg+g^2,&\quad z=m^2+mn+n^2;\\ x=(f+g)n^2+2gmn-fm^2,&\quad y=-gn^2+2fnm+(f+g)m^2\,. \end{align*}$$ Then we have $x^2+xy+y^2=(f^2 + fg + g^2)(m^2 + mn + n^2)^2$. The radical of $xy(x+y)(x^2+xy+y^2)$ has the form $xy(x+y)sz$, which leads to the (interesting) identity $$\bigl(xy(x+y)\bigr)sz\bigl(fg(f+g)\bigr)=sz\prod_{i=1}^3{(u_i^2-sn^2)}\,,$$ where $u_1=gn-fm$, $u_2=(f+g)m+fn$, and $u_3=gm+(f+g)n$. I also tried to use the following summation identity: let  $e>0$  be an integer and  $w=(-1)^e$. Choose $r=\frac{1}{3}(2^e-w)$ which is an integer. For $f,g,m,n$ define $$x=\frac14\sum_{i=0}^r\sum_{j=0}^2\binom{2^e}{3i+j}n^jm^{-j}(-1)^in^{3i}m^{2^e-3i}\,\times\\ \bigr[(f+(f + 2g)w)j^2+(-f + 2g +(-5f - 4g)w)j -2f - 2g +(2f - 2g)w\bigl]\,,$$ $$y=\frac14\sum_{i=0}^r\sum_{j=0}^2\binom{2^e}{3i+j}n^jm^{-j}(-1)^in^{3i}m^{2^e-3i}\,\times\\ \bigr[(-f-g-(-f+g)w)j^2+(3f+g -(-f - 5g)w)j + 2g -(4f+2g)w\bigl]\,.$$ Then the equality $x^2+xy+y^2=(f^2+fg+g^2)(m^2+mn+n^2)^{2^e}$ holds, which enable us to find all solutions with $s_i$ square-free of the form $s_0\prod_k{s_k^{2k}}$.

Thus, $$\operatorname{rad}(C^2-AB)<\leq C^2-AB\operatorname{rad}(ABC)\operatorname{rad}(C^2-AB)-AB<C\operatorname{rad}(C^2-AB)-AB\,,$$ which implies $AB<(C-1)\operatorname{rad}(C^2-AB)\,.$ We can also conclude that $C=A+B<\operatorname{rad}(C^2-AB)$, and thus for small values of $\operatorname{rad}(C^2-AB)=3,7,13,19,21\dots$ (OEIS sequence A034017) there are only a limited number of ABC triples.",,['number-theory']

Now,  $$a^2 + b^2 = (b + \Omega)^2 = b^2 + 2b \Omega +  \Omega ^2\qquad\qquad(1)$$ which is same as  $$b = [a^2 -  \Omega ^2] \div 2\Omega.$$  Which implies that $\Omega$ divides $a^2$ for $a^2- \Omega ^2) \gt 0$ or $(a - \Omega) (a + \Omega) \gt 0$, which implies that  $$a \gt \Omega\qquad\qquad(2).$$ Now, I will consider $a = 2^m$; then $\Omega$ is also even. Otherwise, if $a = 2^m + 1$ then obviously $\Omega$ is odd. Now, I will consider both $a$ and $\Omega$ is an even numbers such that, $a = 2^m$ and $\Omega = 2^r$ for some $m$ and $r$. By (2), we have $m \gt r$ and by (1), we have $$(2^m)^2 = 2^r (2b + 2^r)$$ or  $$b = \frac{2^r}{2}((4^m \div 4^r) - 1))\qquad\qquad(3)$$ As I said earlier, $a$ and $\Omega$ is an even, then $b$ should be an odd number. i.e., $r  = 1$ Therefore, the required triplets for even numbers in powers of $2$ are  $(2^m, (4^m \div 4) - 1, (4^m \div 4 ) + 1))$ Now my question is, how one can generalize the same for following? Case 1: if we take odd numbers for powers of some prime Case 2: if we take even numbers with prime powers. Thanking you,",,"['number-theory', 'elementary-number-theory', 'pythagorean-triples']"

Here's what I've done so far. Let $K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-6})$ . As $-6\not\equiv 1$ (mod 4), we have that $\mathcal{O}_K=\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-6}]$ . Let $v$ be the finite place of $K$ corresponding to the (non-principal) prime ideal $(3,\sqrt{-6})$ . It's fairly easy to see that $K_v=\mathbb{Q}_3(\sqrt{-6})$ , and that the residue field is $k_v\cong\mathcal{O}_{K}/(3,\sqrt{-6})\cong\mathbb{F}_3$ .  Now, by Hensel's lemma, $\sqrt{-2}\in\mathbb{Q}_3$ , so it follows that $\sqrt{3}\in\mathbb{Q}_2(\sqrt{-6})$ . In $\mathcal{O}_K$ , $(3)$ decomposes as $(3,\sqrt{-6})^2$ , so $v(3)=2$ , and hence $v(\sqrt{3})=1$ . So we can legitimately choose $\sqrt{3}$ as a uniformizer of $\mathcal{O}_{K_v}$ . This means that every element of $\mathcal{O}_{K_v}$ has a unique representation $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_n\sqrt{3}^n, \text{ where } a_n\in\{-1,0,1\}.$$ The elements of $\mathcal{O}_{K_v}^{\times}$ are the ones where $a_0=\pm1$ . Now, using Hensel's lemma I went ahead and showed that $$(\mathcal{O}_{K_v}^{\times})^3=\{\pm1+\sum_{n=3}^{\infty}a_n\sqrt{3}^n~|~a_n\in\{-1,0,1\}\}.$$ But how do I find distinct representatives for $\mathcal{O}_{K_v}^{\times}/(\mathcal{O}_{K_v}^{\times})^3$ ? Does modding out by the group above mean that I can just look up to sign and ignore everything past $\sqrt{3}^3$ , so that a set of representatives would be $\{1,1\pm\sqrt{3},1\pm3,1\pm\sqrt{3}\pm3\}$ , which has size 9 (the 2 $\pm$ 's are independent in the last expression)? Perhaps my working is not useful, because I've written things additively but the groups are multiplicative. Also, I could just as well have chosen $\sqrt{-6}$ as my uniformizer.

By considering the minimal polynomial $x^2-x-1$ of $(1+\sqrt{5})/2$ modulo $11$ I find: $$x^2-x-1\equiv (x+7)(x+3)\pmod{11}.$$ This tells me that the ideals over $11\Bbb Z$ are $\langle 11, x + 7 \rangle, \langle 11, x + 3 \rangle$ , with $x = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$ .

90,Extending absolute values on local fields - what is the 'correct' normalization and the relation to the global theory?,Extending absolute values on local fields - what is the 'correct' normalization and the relation to the global theory?,,"I'm having a tough time figuring out the 'correct' normalization for extending absolute values of local fields. I'm also trying to piece together how this interacts with the global theory, so below is essentially a discussion of my thoughts and a few questions at the end. Am I thinking about this the right way? If $K/\mathbb Q$ is finite then every nonzero ideal $\mathfrak a\subseteq \mathcal O_K$ has a unique factorization $$ \mathfrak a=\prod_{\mathfrak p: \,\text{prime}}\mathfrak p^{e_\mathfrak p(\mathfrak a)}. $$ The function $v_\mathfrak p:\mathcal O_K\rightarrow \mathbb Z\cup \infty$ defined by $v_\mathfrak p(x)={e_\mathfrak p(x\mathcal O_K)}$ defines a discrete valuation on $\mathcal O_K$ . We can extend this to a valuation on $K$ by noting that all elements of $K$ can be represented by a quotient of algebraic integers. Fixing a prime $p$ and a prime ideal $\mathfrak p\mid p$ , for any $0<a<1$ we have an induced nonarchimedean absolute value on $K$ , given by $|x|_\mathfrak p=a^{v_\mathfrak p(x)}$ . Completing $K$ with respect to this absolute value results in a finite extension $K_\mathfrak p$ of $\mathbb Q_p$ . If $e$ and $f$ are the ramification and inertia degrees of $p$ , by Neukirch Theorem 4.8, I also understand that $K_\mathfrak p$ has a unique absolute value extending the $p$ -adic absolute value $|\cdot |_p$ on $\mathbb Q_p$ , given by $$ |x|_\mathfrak p=|N_{K_\mathfrak p/\mathbb Q_p}(x)|_p^{\frac{1}{ef}} $$ since $[K_\mathfrak p:\mathbb Q_p]=ef$ . This forces us to fix a value for $a$ above: since we want the absolute value on $K_\mathfrak p$ to extend $|\cdot |_p$ , we'd like to have $|p |_\mathfrak p=p^{-1}$ . Therefore, we need $ a^{v_\mathfrak p(p)}=|N_{K_\mathfrak p/\mathbb Q_p}(p)|^{\frac{1}{ef}}, $ which, since $N_{K_\mathfrak p/\mathbb Q_p}(p)=p^{ef}$ (do I need to assume the extension is Galois here?) and $v_\mathfrak p(p)=e$ , implies that $a=p^{-1/e}$ . Therefore, we normalize so that $$ |x|_\mathfrak p=p^{-v_\mathfrak p(x)/e} $$ is the absolute value extending that of $\mathbb Q_p$ . All this said, Serre mentions in page 27 of Local Fields, that for a locally compact field (which is the case for $K_\mathfrak p$ ), there is a ""canonical way to choose the number $a$ [defined the same as I have done above]: one takes $a=q^{-1}$ , where $q$ is the number of elements in the reside field"". In our case, I think that $q=|\mathcal O_{K_\mathfrak p}/\mathfrak p|=p^f$ ? If so, then it seems like Serre would have us take $a=p^{-f}$ ... What is the advantage of doing this? Am I making some horrible mistake here? Is there a better way to think about (normalized) valuations on extensions? Is there a way to 'get around' computing the field norm whenever we'd like to take the absolute value of an an element? I realize I've bunched a few questions together here, and I'd be happy to write them separately if someone with more experience on this site would recommend it.

My approach was that the digits must alter between 3 and 7 eventually (since a prime can't end with 2 or 5 for larger than that and a prime can't consist of just two non-1 digits, those would be dividable by 2, 5 or 11) and we can see where it ends. But if we change the base that approach fails. For example in base 8 a prime can end in 3, 5 or 7 AFAICS so such numbers can end in a altering sequence of 3, 5 and 7s but having tree digits to alter between there's always a way to vary the sequence. I tried to write a python snippet to produce such numbers in different bases and for those I've tested the program seem to hang (ie don't seem to find any more numbers). Is it true that there are only a finite number of such numbers for every base?","For no particular reason I stumbled upon the sequence/set of all numbers where all substrings of the decimal representation is prime (A085823).
