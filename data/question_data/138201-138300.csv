12,Interpreting d as an operator in differential calculus.,Interpreting d as an operator in differential calculus.,,"I am enjoying this mathematics book for the general public called Measurement by Paul Lockhart.  For the most part, I am happy with his metaphors and intuitive explanations of the different concepts, but I occasionally come along something that I wish was discussed more rigorously. There are also times when I can't tell whether something is part of general mathematical practice or is just his own idiosyncratic invention. In particular, I want your help in interpreting what Lockhart calls the ""Leibniz d operator"". I had better quote an example passage from the book to show you how he treats this concept: How can we take the information    $$a^{2}=b^{2}+3$$   $$c=2a+b$$   and determine the ratios $da:db:dc$ ? The direct approach would be to give the mixing board a kick, check out the variation of the sliders, and figure out where their proportions are heading as the kick gets smaller. But here's the point: we don't actually need to go through this laborious process. Instead, we can simply apply the d- operator to both sides of the equations:   $$d(a^{2})=d(b^2+3)$$   $$dc=d(2a+b)$$   After all, if two variables are always equal their rates must also be equal. Expanding these accordingly, we obtain the differential equations   $$2a\:da=2b\:db$$   $$dc=2da+db$$   So for instance, at the moment when a = 2, b = 1, and c = 5 (which does in fact satisfy our original equations and so qualifies as an actual moment), we have   $$4\:da=2\:db$$   $$dc=2\:da+db$$   Thus at that precise instant, b is moving twice as fast as a , and c is moving four times as fast. In other words, the ratio $da:db:dc$ is $1:2:4$. We now have a simple and direct method for solving any problem concerning relative rates of change$-$just $d$ everything! ""Kicking the mixing board"" is his metaphor for using the difference quotient. I recognize and understand this concept of the derivative from my first exposure to calculus. I am familiar with the $\frac{dy}{dx}$ notation, but this is not with respect to any variable; it is just this $d$-ing something arbitrarily that is unfamiliar to me. I suppose my question is a reference request related to this idea of $d$-ing both sides of an equation. I think I understand what he is doing, but I want to read a more rigorous discussion of how $d$ can act like some sort of function or operator.

59,Trying to solve $tuu'= -1-u^2.$,Trying to solve,tuu'= -1-u^2.,"I am looking for the solution the the ODE $$tuu'= -1-u^2.$$ This problem came up in a book on differential equations that I am working through out of personal interest, so it's not  homework or anything. I tried the following approach. First I want to look for a solution to $tuu'= -u^2$ giving $$\frac{u'}{u}dt =- \frac{dt}{t}$$ This gives $\ln u = -\ln t = \ln \frac{1}{t}$ so that $u = \frac{C}{t}$ . The second part $tuu'= -1$ gives $$uu'dt =- \frac{dt}{t}$$ which has as its solution $u = \sqrt{\ln\left(1 \over t^{2}\right) +D}$ . Now the total solution to the original DE is $$u = \frac{C}{t} + \sqrt{\ln\left(1 \over t^{2}\right) + D}$$ The initial value given for this problem is $u(0) = 2$ . Now I dont see how I can even fill in $u(0)$ because we would be dividing by $0$ . I am sure I messed up the integration somewhere. I also noted that another solution to the DE is given by $u=0$ or $u=i$ ,  though both these dont satisfy the initial value either. However, this leads me to believe that my method of solving is not right and that I missed possible solutions. As is stands now I would be forced to conclude ta $C=0$ but then I still haven't solved it.

(I realize I am missing the limits $0, T$ in the integrals.) While this proof is very neat, I'm still not really understanding why this all works out. Is there a way to understand this by a visual or a physical example?","I've seen the proof provided in Strogatz where he compares the change in the gradient function $V$ after one period $T$; on one hand, $\Delta V=0$ because $V(x(T)=V(x(0))$, while on the other, $\int dV=\int (\nabla V \bullet \dot x)dt=\int- ||x||^2dt$ which is always negative for any $x$ that moves at all.
