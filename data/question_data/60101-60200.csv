8,Where are the other Pythagorean Theorems?,Where are the other Pythagorean Theorems?,,"One way to prove the Pythagorean Theorem is by noticing that its altitude divides it into two pieces similar to itself. The theorem immediately follows from the fact that areas scale with the square of the ratio and the ratios are determined by the sides of the big triangle. The thing about this proof is that it doesn't seem to have anything to do with triangles. Wouldn't any family of shapes that can be - non- trivially - divided into similar copies of itself yield a similar result? The condition for a non-trivial division is inspired by the fact that any triangle or parallelogram can be divided into four congruent copies of itself, but this division doesn't lead to any interesting equation. I'm not sure what formal condition makes a division trivial, though. One could argue that the $(\sqrt 2:1)$ parallelogram can be non trivially divided into two similar copies of itself. However, we can't really obtain any equation from it, since there is no degree of freedom on its sides. Could it be that the right triangles consist of the only interesting family? Is the Pythagorean Theorem really that special? Update 1: I just came across this article , which surprisingly proves that any polygon that can be divided into two similar copies of itself must be similar to one of the following: As the parallelogram, the Golden Bee do not give us any equation.

However, I would greatly appreciate advice on what I should change, and where I can learn the standard notation.

After some messing around, I arrived at making the next term as follows. $D_4: d_n= d_{n-1} + x + (d_{n-1} - d_{n-2})$ The next day, I continued my brainstorming and made the next 2 formulae. $D_5: d_n= d_{n-1} + x + 2(d_{n-1} - d_{n-2}) - (d_{n-2} - d_{n-3})$ $D_6: d_n= d_{n-1} + x + 3(d_{n-1} - d_{n-2}) - 3(d_{n-2} - d_{n-3})+(d_{n-3} - d_{n-4})$ I hit a brick wall for a little while, and I stared at the formulae I had for hours until I noticed something. I looked at the coefficients of the terms, and saw a pattern forming; the coefficients follow Pascal's triangle. This can be visualized best in the image below, which includes the formulae from $D_3$ through $D_8$ . Apologies for my handwriting The coefficients of the formulae appear to follow the values of Pascal's triangle indefinitely. It is worth noting for sets $D_n$ where $d_2$ is an odd number, the coefficients are always central binomial rows and the last term is always negative.

19,A riddle with a witch and some gnomes (guessing numbers on hats),A riddle with a witch and some gnomes (guessing numbers on hats),,"My question concerns a variation and a generalization of the following riddle. The Original Riddle: A wicked witch kidnaps 2 gnomes. She paralyzes them, and places a hat on each of their heads. Each hat either has the number $1$ or the number $2$ written on it (both hats may have the same number). She then places the gnomes so they face each other (each gnome sees the number on the other gnome's hat). Afterwards, she puts the gnomes in separate rooms, where she undoes the paralysis, and asks each of the gnomes to guess which number is written on their own hat. If at least one of the gnomes guesses right, she'll let them go, otherwise she'll use them to make a gnome-stew. Luckily for the gnomes, they knew about the witch's plan, and they planned ahead. They prepared a strategy that will always guarantee that at least one of them guesses right. What was their strategy? Solution: The first gnome (call him gnome $A$), will always select the opposite of what he saw on the second gnome's (call him gnome $B$) hat, while gnome $B$ will always select the same value that he saw on gnome $A$'s hat. Putting this strategy in a truth table shows that it always works: $$ \begin{array}{c|c|c|c} \text{Gnome A's Hat} & \text{Gnome B's Hat} & \text{Gnome A's Guess} & \text{Gnome B's Guess} \\ \hline 1 & \color{lime}1 & 2 & \color{lime}{1} \\ \color{lime}1 & 2 & \color{lime}1 & 1 \\ \color{lime}2 & 1 & \color{lime}2 & 2 \\ 2 & \color{lime}2 & 1 & \color{lime}2 \\ \end{array} $$ One can also give a more intuitive explanation for the solution: Gnome $A$ gambles that both gnomes have different valued numbers on their hats, while gnome $B$ gambles that both gnomes have equal values numbers in their hats. Since these are the only possibilities, at least one of them must be correct. A  Variation: How can the riddle be solved with 3 gnomes, and hats with 3 values ($1$, $2$ and $3$), where each of the gnomes sees the values on the other two gnomes' hats? And is there an intuitive explanation for the solution? Partial Answer: Trying out some values I found the following strategy solves the problem for 3 gnomes: $$ % outer vertical array of arrays \begin{array}{c} % inner horizontal array of arrays \begin{array}{cc} % inner array of minimum values \begin{array}{c|c|c} \text{A's Hat} & \text{B's Hat} & \text{C's Guess} \\ \hline 1 & 1 & 3 \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 1 & 3 & 1 \\ 2 & 1 & 3 \\ 2 & 2 & 1 \\ 2 & 3 & 2 \\ 3 & 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 2 & 2 \\ 3 & 3 & 1 \end{array} & % inner array of maximum values \begin{array}{c|c|c} \text{A's Hat} & \text{C's Hat} & \text{B's Guess} \\ \hline 1 & 1 & 2 \\ 1 & 2 & 1 \\ 1 & 3 & 3 \\ 2 & 1 & 1 \\ 2 & 2 & 2 \\ 2 & 3 & 2 \\ 3 & 1 & 1 \\ 3 & 2 & 3 \\ 3 & 3 & 3 \end{array} \end{array} \\ \\ % inner array of delta values \begin{array}{c|c|c} \text{B's Hat} & \text{C's Hat} & \text{A's Guess} \\ \hline 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 2 & 2 \\ 1 & 3 & 3 \\ 2 & 1 & 3 \\ 2 & 2 & 1 \\ 2 & 3 & 3 \\ 3 & 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 2 & 1 \\ 3 & 3 & 2 \end{array} \end{array} $$ Where the third column in each table represents a gnome's guess, given what he sees on the other two gnomes' heads.

I tried to do some counting based on the number of pairs and pigeonhole to get the conclusion that there must be a point that is the circumcenter of a triangle made up of points in . Assuming is a minimal solution (in terms of size of ) does not seem to help that much. EDIT: originally the question left open whether it was in the plane or space, but the space case is trivial. EDIT EDIT: added a note to say the set should be non-empty. Note that we do not need at least two points, because when we say ""pairs of points"" we don't say ""distinct pair of points""!",\textbf{Problem:} P \mathbb{R}^2 x y P a b P a b x y P P P,"['combinatorics', 'contest-math', 'combinatorial-geometry']"
23,Finding real money on a strange weighing device,Finding real money on a strange weighing device,,"You have 50 coins which each weigh either 20 grams or 10 grams.

If you put coins $x_1, x_2, ..., x_j$ on the device the first time, then you have to put coins $(x_1+1) \bmod 50, (x_2+1) \bmod 50, ..., (x_j+1) \bmod 50$ on the scale the next time, and coins  $(x_1+2) \bmod 50, (x_2+2) \bmod 50, ..., (x_j+2) \bmod 50$ the next time and so on. In other words, all the weighings are defined by the choice of coins you choose to weigh the first time. Under this rule, what is the smallest number of weighings that will always tell you   exactly which coins weigh 10 grams and which weigh 20?

A N-mover is a knight-like piece that can move to any square that has a Euclidean distance of $\sqrt{N}$ from its current square. That is, it can move from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$ if and only if $x^2 + y^2 = N$ (And of course $x$ and $y$ need to be integers). For example, a 1-mover can move to any of the four adjacent grids, and a 5-mover is a regular chess knight. Consider an infinite board. Starting from a given grid, what proportion of the infinite grid can a N-mover reach? For clarity, let's say the answer is defined as $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\text{The number of grids }(x,y)\text{ with }|x|,|y|<=n\text{ and reachable from }(0,0)}{(2n+1)^2}$$ Some thoughts: If we treat each grid and possible move as a Gaussian integer, the reachable grids are sums of Gaussian integer multiples of the moves (we can multiply by $i$ because our set of moves is 4-fold rotational symmetric). Using Bezout's identity, they are the multiples of the GCD. Therefore, the answer should be $1/|d|^2$ where $d$ is the GCD of the moves if there are possible moves, or 0 otherwise. Let's call the answer $f(N)$ . Some experimenting shows that $f$ is multiplicative, with $$f(p^n) = \begin{cases}1/2^n, & \text{if } p = 2 \\ 1, & \text{if } p = 4k+1 \\ 0, & \text{if } p = 4k+3, n\text{ is odd} \\ 1/p^n, & \text{if } p = 4k+3, n\text{ is even}\end{cases}$$ I've been trying to prove the above result for some time.

While in algebra while a solution to an equation such as $$x^2+4x+3=0$$ is desired, the solution can be obtained and can be checked by plugging the solution by plugging the answer back into the equation.

51,Water-pouring problem with $n$ jugs: closed form for total number of configurations.,Water-pouring problem with  jugs: closed form for total number of configurations.,n,"Consider the following water-pouring puzzle. Given $n$ initially empty jugs with maximum volumes $V_1, V_2,\dots ,V_n$ , and the following three actions on a jug: A jug is filled completely. A jug is emptied completely. The contents of a jug are poured into another jug until it is completely full, leaving any excess in the original jug. Is the closed form for the total number of possible configurations of $(V_{\rm jug\,1},V_{\rm jug\,2},\dots,V_{{\rm jug}\,n})$ given by $$\prod_{i=1}^{n}\left(\frac{V_i}{\gcd(V_1,\dots,V_n)}+1\right)-\prod_{i=1}^{n}\left(\frac{V_i}{\gcd(V_1,\dots,V_n)}-1\right)?$$ Example: Suppose we have two jugs with specified volumes, $V_1=4, V_2=3$ . Then the possible permutations of $(V_1, V_2)$ are $(0,0),(0,3),(3,0),(3,3),(4,0),(1,3),(1,0),(0,1),(4,1),(2,3)$ , $(2,0),(0,2),(4,2),(4,3)$ i.e. $14$ tuples, agreeing with $(4+1)(3+1)-(4-1)(3-1)=14$ , since $\gcd(4,3)=1$ . By considering the expansion of the monic polynomial $\prod\limits_{i=1}^n(\lambda-V_i)$ and substituting $\lambda=\pm1$ , we can also express this in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomial as the following $$2\sum_{k=1}^{n/2}\frac{e_{2k-1}(V_1,\dots ,V_n)}{\gcd(V_1,\dots ,V_n)^{2k-1}}\quad\text{for $n$ even and }2+2\sum_{k=1}^{(n-1)/2}\frac{e_{2k}(V_1,\dots ,V_n)}{\gcd(V_1,\dots ,V_n)^{2k}}\quad\text{for $n$ odd}, $$ for which I credit @TheSimpliFire for finding all the above general expressions. For example: $n=2$ (the $2$ jug case): the number of possible permutations for $2$ jugs of maximum volume $V_1,V_2$ is $2(V_1+V_2)/\gcd(V_1,V_2)$ ; or $n=3$ (the $3$ jug case): with maximum volumes $V_1,V_2,V_3$ , this has a total number of possible permutations of $2+2(V_1V_2+V_1V_3+V_2V_3)/\gcd(V_1,V_2,V_3)^2$ . However, one can simplify the problem by assuming WLOG that $V_1,V_2,\dots ,V_n$ are all coprime to each other and asking whether the closed form for the total number of possible combinations is given by $$\prod_{i=1}^{n} (V_i+1) - \prod_{i=1}^{n}(V_i-1)$$ since suppose for example that $\gcd(V_1,\dots ,V_n)=3$ , then we cannot make a jug have a volume that is not a multiple of $3$ , giving the same number of possible combinations as if we began with an initial step of scaling all the maximum volumes down by a factor of $3$ such that all the maximum volumes would now be coprime. Since writing this question, I have uploaded a Python script of mine, which is able to generate a table of the number of possible states for up to $4$ jugs, to GitHub and which was used to greatly assist in determining the formula in the question. I have linked it here in the hope of aiding anyone attempting to determine the number of states without the need for tedious by-hand computations. The code can likely be optimised massively, and I would be interested if anyone knows how to make it better. The context for this problem is due to a computer science coursework question of a friend of mine which asked to write a Java program using the DFS algorithm to find the number of possible states for the $V_1=8,V_2=5,V_3=3$ case, however, I wanted to think of the problem more mathematically and abstractly and out of my own interest tried to generalise it and find a general formula.

60,Covering each point of the plane with circles three times,Covering each point of the plane with circles three times,,"The following problem arose from an Italian discussion group: I am not so sure about the optimal tags for the question, so feel free to improve them. Definition : we say that $E\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ admits a cover with degree $d$ if there is a family $\mathscr{F}$ of distinct circles (with positive radii) such that every point of $E$ belongs to exactly $d$ circles in $\mathscr{F}$ . Preliminary results : There is a cover of $\mathbb{R}^2\setminus\{O\}$ with degree $1$ given by concentric circles; There is no cover of $\mathbb{R}^2$ with degree $1$ , due to the accumulation point of any chain of nested circles; There is a cover of $\mathbb{R}^2$ with degree $2$ , for instance the one given by the unit circles centered at $(2n,y)$ for any $n\in\mathbb{Z},y\in\mathbb{R}$ ; There is a cover of $\mathbb{R}^2\setminus\{O\}$ with degree $2$ , for instance the one given by the circles tangent to the sides of a quadrant. Now the actual question, which I did not manage to tackle (yet): Is there a cover of $\mathbb{R}^2$ with degree $3$ ? I believe the answer is negative: I (unsuccessfully) tried to prove that any degree-3 cover admits a degree-2 subcover, in order to get a contradictory degree-1 cover by switching to the complement. Any insight is welcome. Small update : actually it is not possible to extract a degree-2 subcover from a (hypothetical) degree-3 cover. Once a circle $\Gamma_1$ is removed from a degree-3 cover, we are forced to remove a circle contained in the interior of $\Gamma_1$ and this leads to a chain of circles converging to a point. If a cover with degree 3 exists, every chain of contained circles has a finite number of elements. The elements of $\mathscr{F}$ form a POset: we may say that $\Gamma_1 < \Gamma_2$ if $\Gamma_1$ is contained in the interior of $\Gamma_2$ . This also allows to assign a parity to each element of $\mathscr{F}$ and each point of the plane, according to the length of a maximal chain contained in the circle / surrounding such point. Further thoughts : let us assume that a degree-3 cover of $\mathbb{R}^2$ exists. By the chain argument there is a disk $D$ such that $\partial D\in\mathscr{F}$ and every circle covering $\mathring{D}$ meets $\partial D$ at two non-antipodal points. Let us name $\mathscr{f}$ the family of circles covering $\mathring{D}$ . We have that $\partial D$ is covered three times, so the circles traversing each point of $\partial D$ are $\partial D$ itself and two elements of $\mathscr{f}$ . These couples of circles ""exiting"" from any point of $S^1=\partial D$ have to cover three times any point of $\mathring{D}$ , which is pretty strange. Many sub-questions came to my mind: Is it possible to partition $\mathscr{f}$ into two/three subfamilies of disjoint circles? Is it possible to use the descending chain condition as a substitute for continuity, then apply some topological trick? Are Tucker's lemma , Euler characteristic or the theory of planar graphs useful in some way? Starting from any $P_0\in\partial D$ we may take $P_{-1}$ and $P_1$ as the points of $\partial{D}$ connected to $P_0$ via the elements of $\mathscr{f}$ through $P_0$ , then define $P_{-2},P_{2},P_{-3},P_{3},\ldots$ in the same way. This gives a partition of $\partial D$ into finite cycles (a cycle of length $2$ might occur if $P_1=P_{-1}$ ) and ""infinite cycles"" with a numerability of elements. Infinite cycles have limit points, which are troublesome. On the other hand also a partition into finite cycles only does not seem to stand any chance of covering any point of $\mathring{D}$ exactly three times. Yet another measure-theoretic thought . Let $S^1=\partial D$ (which we may assume to have radius $1$ ), let $P\in S^1$ . Two elements of $\mathscr{f}$ go through $P$ : let $L(P)$ be the total length of the arcs given by the intersections with $\mathring{D}$ . Let us assume that $L:S^1\to (0,4\pi)$ is an integrable function. By integrating $L$ over $S^1$ we have that each arc in $\mathscr{f}\cap\mathring{D}$ is counted twice, hence $$ \int_{S_1} L = 2\int_{\text{arcs in }\mathscr{f}} 1=2\cdot 3\text{Area}(D) = 6\pi$$ and the average length of an arc in $\mathscr{f}$ is $\frac{3}{2}$ . It follows that most of the arcs of an ""integrable 3-cover"" of $\mathring{D}$ are pretty short, forcing a concentration of the arcs near the boundary of $D$ . This violation of uniformity probably leads to the fact that if a cover of $\mathbb{R}^2$ with degree $3$ exists, it is not integrable.","The following problem arose from an Italian discussion group: I am not so sure about the optimal tags for the question, so feel free to improve them.

"" I argue in my answer that the number of ways $S(n)$ to obtain twice as many heads as tails for the first time in $3n$ coin flips is $\binom{3n}{n} \frac{2}{3n-1}$.  The argument works by showing that $S(n)$ satisfies a recurrence and then using a binomial convolution identity to show that $\binom{3n}{n} \frac{2}{3n-1}$ satisfies the recurrence as well. However, it seems to me that there ought to be a nice, direct combinatorial proof that $S(n) = \binom{3n}{n} \frac{2}{3n-1}$.  After all, there are $\binom{3n}{n}$ sequences of $3n$ coin flips in which $n$ are tails, and the number of those for which we see twice as many heads as tails for the first time is just $\frac{2}{3n-1}$ of that.   I've been thinking about this some the past few days but have been unable to find a combinatorial explanation of the fraction $\frac{2}{3n-1}$. So my question is... Can someone provide a combinatorial proof that $S(n) = \binom{3n}{n} \frac{2}{3n-1}$? And, more generally, if $S(n,r)$ is the number of ways to obtain $r$ times as many heads as tails then my argument in the answer mentioned above shows that $S(n,r) = \binom{(r+1)n}{n} \frac{r}{(r+1)n-1}$.  It would be nice if the proof were generalizable to the $S(n,r)$ case. One thought is that it might be possible to adapt one of the combinatorial proofs that the $n$th Catalan number $C_n$ is $\binom{2n}{n} \frac{1}{n+1}$.  In fact, in the $r=1$ case the question is equivalent to finding the number of Dyck paths from $(0,0)$ to $(n,n)$ that do not touch the diagonal $y=x$ except at $(0,0)$ and $(n,n)$.   This is known to be $2C_{n-1} = \binom{2n-2}{n-1} \frac{1}{n} = \binom{2n}{n}\frac{1}{2n-1} = S(n,2).$ In fact, that last paragraph makes me wonder if there might be some generalization of the Catalan numbers in this direction.  Or perhaps the alternative formulation $S(n,r) = \binom{(r+1)n-2}{n-1} \frac{r+1}{n}$ admits a combinatorial proof more easily. Added : I think Qiaochu Yuan's argument below about using Raney's lemma is on the right track, but it doesn't quite get to the expression I'm looking for.  Raney's lemma is about a sequence in which all partial sums are positive.  However, in obtaining $r$ times as many heads as tails for the first time the partial sums ($+r$ for each tail and $-1$ for each head) do not all have to be positive or all negative.  For example, you could have a sequence like HHHT, with overall $+1$, and then if the next flip is a tail you would have HHHTT, with overall $-1$, and we still haven't reached exactly twice as many heads as tails.

80,The Weaver Android app $\rightarrow$ cute combinatorics problem,The Weaver Android app  cute combinatorics problem,\rightarrow,"There's an Android puzzle app called ""The Weaver"". My question is why every level seems to be solvable in far fewer moves than one might naively think. Here's a link for people who want to play along on their Android devices, but this is not necessary to understand the question. (NB I am nothing to do with promoting this game in any way; I am an end user who just got interested in the mathematics behind the game). It's very easy to explain the objective of this puzzle game. A level looks like this when you start it: and it looks like this when you've finished it: The ribbons ""flow"" from top to bottom and you can twist or untwist two ribbons by tapping on where they meet. You can't change the order of the ribbons going ""in"" (from the top) or their colours. The object is to twist the ribbons around within the rectangular grid so that the ""output"" of the grid matches the small coloured squares. For example, in the game above, initially only one output square is matched -- the green square which is enabling a green ribbon to ""escape"" from the rectangular grid. All other squares don't match and so some ribbon-twisting is needed. A move on a level consists of twisting or untwisting two ribbons (by tapping on them). It's very cute. There is also a ""star"" system, and to get 3 stars in a level you must solve it using the minimum number of ""twists"". As you can see I've done a very bad job at solving level 2.4; I've got no stars at all. There are solutions to this level with fewer twists -- in fact this is obvious, because in my solution here the bottom ""switch"" is switched but it doesn't need to be -- those two orange ribbons could just pass over each other. The question. I worked through the levels of this game, and I was quite surprised to find that even on big boards (the biggest is 6x6) one always seemed to be able to solve them in far fewer moves than I expected. Although the the game's board size never gets bigger than $6\times 6$ and there are also only 6 colours in the app, one can of course just dream about arbitrarily large boards involving arbitrarily many colours. Conjecture On an $a$ by $b$ board, if the level is solvable at all, then it is solvable in at most $a+b-1$ moves (i.e. with at most $a+b-1$ ""untwists""). In particular I am conjecturing that the largest number of twists you need to make is $O(a+b)$ rather then $O(ab)$. Here is what I know about this conjecture. Lemma The conjecture is true if $a=1$. Proof: trivial (there are only $b=a+b-1$ switches on the board). Lemma the conjecture is true if $a=b=2$ Proof: the only counterexample would be a board for which the only solution would be with all four switches switched. But unswitching the top and the bottom switch leads to the same order of ribbon outputs. Lemma The conjecture is true if $ab\leq 20$. Proof: brute force computer search. Note that in this latter case I will allow an arbitrary number of colours (not just 6 as in the app). Lemma The conjecture is true for all 150 levels that come with the game. Proof: brute force check. Lemma For given $a,b\geq1$ there exists a level whose only solution involves $a+b-1$ twists (and in particular my conjecture is best possible). Proof: One checks that the level with $a+b$ distinct input ribbons and which is solved by switching the $a+b-1$ switches comprising the top right and bottom right sides of the grid of switches, has this property (NB the check is rather easier to do once you have played a few levels and got the hang of the combinatorics). I think that's everything I know. Can anyone finish the job by proving my conjecture? [Added two days later] Here is my interpretation of some discussions (now deleted) with Calum Gilhooley -- a group-theoretic interpretation of the conjecture (but it's a slightly strange group-theoretic question). We fix positive integers $a$ and $b$, and define a set $S=\{r_1,r_2,\ldots,r_a,s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_b\}$ of $a+b$ symbols (thought of as the ribbons). Each ""switch"" can be thought of as a transposition, and it's important to note that with the model I'm about to describe, the initial state of the switch is that the ribbons cross so the transposition is actually a transposition (i.e. it can be switched off rather than on). The following picture shows why the convention is sensible -- when all the switches are switched we have something that looks like the identity as you can see from the picture below. We read the transpositions from top to bottom in the picture; if the $r_i$ and $s_j$ are also numbered from top to bottom then the first transposition is $(r_1\ s_1)$, the next two (which commute so can be made in either order) are $(r_1\ s_2)$ and $(r_2\ s_1)$ and so on; at the $n$th step we consider $(r_i\ s_j)$ for $i+j=n+1$ and this goes down to the final transposition $(r_a\ s_b)$. Multiplying all of these $ab$ transpositions together gives us an element $X=(r_1\ s_1)(r_1\ s_2)(r_2\ s_1)\cdots(r_a\ s_b)$. This is the initial state of the board. Now for $S$ a subset of $\{1,2,\ldots,a\}\times\{1,2,\ldots,b\}$ we can consider the element $X_S$ obtained by taking the product representation of $X$ and then removing the transpositions $(r_i\ s_j)$ for $(i,j)\in S$ (and multiplying those that we didn't remove together in the same order as we did to get $X$). Reformulation of the question Is it true that for $S\subseteq\{1,2,,\ldots,a\}\times\{1,2,\ldots,b\}$ the permutation $X_S$ is equal to $X_T$ for some $T$ of size at most $a+b-1$? Here is a special case: is it true that the identity can be written as $X_T$ for some $T$ of size at most $a+b-1$? That's probably a relatively easy question. It's true for $a=b$, that's not hard to check.","There's an Android puzzle app called ""The Weaver"". My question is why every level seems to be solvable in far fewer moves than one might naively think. Here's a link for people who want to play along on their Android devices, but this is not necessary to understand the question. (NB I am nothing to do with promoting this game in any way; I am an end user who just got interested in the mathematics behind the game). It's very easy to explain the objective of this puzzle game. A level looks like this when you start it: and it looks like this when you've finished it: The ribbons ""flow"" from top to bottom and you can twist or untwist two ribbons by tapping on where they meet. You can't change the order of the ribbons going ""in"" (from the top) or their colours. The object is to twist the ribbons around within the rectangular grid so that the ""output"" of the grid matches the small coloured squares. For example, in the game above, initially only one output square is matched -- the green square which is enabling a green ribbon to ""escape"" from the rectangular grid. All other squares don't match and so some ribbon-twisting is needed. A move on a level consists of twisting or untwisting two ribbons (by tapping on them). It's very cute. There is also a ""star"" system, and to get 3 stars in a level you must solve it using the minimum number of ""twists"". As you can see I've done a very bad job at solving level 2.4; I've got no stars at all. There are solutions to this level with fewer twists -- in fact this is obvious, because in my solution here the bottom ""switch"" is switched but it doesn't need to be -- those two orange ribbons could just pass over each other. The question. I worked through the levels of this game, and I was quite surprised to find that even on big boards (the biggest is 6x6) one always seemed to be able to solve them in far fewer moves than I expected. Although the the game's board size never gets bigger than $6\times 6$ and there are also only 6 colours in the app, one can of course just dream about arbitrarily large boards involving arbitrarily many colours. Conjecture On an $a$ by $b$ board, if the level is solvable at all, then it is solvable in at most $a+b-1$ moves (i.e. with at most $a+b-1$ ""untwists"").

This solution uses the recurrence relation $f(n) = f(n-1)+5f(n-2)+f(n-3)-f(n-4)$ where $f(n)$ denotes the number of ways to fill the $4\times n$ board with $2 \times 1$ dominoes. I don't fully understand how someone gets that kind of relation (I don't know almost anything of combinatorics or recurrence relations) but I think I understand something. The $f(n-1)$ term comes from observing that there is an unique way to fill the last column and the $5f(n-2)$ term comes from observing there are 5 different ways to fill the last two columns. But i don't get where the terms $f(n-3)-f(n-4)$ come from. So I have two questions, the first one is where these terms come from and second I'd like to ask you for a reference to learn combinatorics and recurrence relations. May you help me? Thanks in advance. -edit- For my solution I used a binary number to represent what configurations of the i-th column was valid. For example 1001 represent that rows 1 and 4 are blocked in the i-th row because in the (i-1)th there is an horizontal domino in that positions. I calculated all the valid transitions such binary numbers could go to (I did this by hand for all the binary numbers from 0000 to 1111). Then I got a function which I programmed using dynamic programming and a technique called bitmask to represent the binary numbers as integers. The function is: $f(i,mask) = \begin{cases} 0 &\mbox{if } i = n, mask \neq 0 \\ 1 & \mbox{if } i = n, mask = 0. \\ \sum f(i+1,mask') &\mbox{else} \end{cases}$ Where mask' is taken from the set of all valid masks from where mask could transition to, also i=n means the first column outside the board as I considered 0-indexing. The code for that is here (this is not actually mine, it's from a mate but it's the exactly same idea).","After solving this problem from SPOJ (count the ways to fill a 4xn board with 2x1 dominoes) I found a different solution while searching on internet.

Here is my attempt: Since $1000000 = 2^6 \cdot 5^6$, each of its divisors has the form $2^a \cdot 5^b$, and a decomposition of 1000000 into a product of five factors has the form $$ 1000000 = (2^{a_1} \cdot 5^{b_1})(2^{a_2} \cdot 5^{b_2})(2^{a_3} \cdot 5^{b_3})(2^{a_4} \cdot 5^{b_4})(2^{a_5} \cdot 5^{b_5}) $$ where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are nonnegative integers which satisfy the conditions $$ a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = 6, b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + b_4 + b_5 = 6 $$ The total number of systems of $a_i$ which satisfy the first equation is $210$ and the same number is for $b_i$. Thus the total number of decompositions is $210 \cdot 210 = 44100$.  However, in this enumeration, factorizations which differ only in the brder of the factors have been counted separately; that is, some factorizations are counted several times each. To get the number of distinct unordered decompositions I must, at first, substract the number of ordered decompositions with at least two identical factors and, at second, divide resulting number by $5!$ to leave only unordered ones. And I'm stuck at the step of counting the number of ordered decompositions with at least two identical factors.  The number of decompositions with $k$ identical factors is $(\lfloor\dfrac{a}{k}\rfloor + 1)(\lfloor\dfrac{b}{k}\rfloor+1){5 \choose k}$, that is, the number of decompositions with two identical factors is $16 \cdot {5 \choose 2} = 160$, three identical factors - $9 \cdot {5 \choose 3} = 90$, four ones - $4 \cdot {5 \choose 4} = 20$ and five ones - $4 \cdot {5 \choose 5} = 4$. Thus the number of distinct decompositions must be equal $\dfrac{44100-160-90-20-4}{5!}$, but this number is not integral. I suppose that the numbers of decompositions with $k$ identical factors overlap and I misuse inclusion-exclusion principle. But I have no idea how I can count that overlapped decompositions.

Therefore there are $1023$ sums of ages and each sum is between $1$ and $600$ . Then there are $600$ possible values, but $1023$ sums.
