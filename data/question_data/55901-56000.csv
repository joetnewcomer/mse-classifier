0,For which logarithm bases is this sum finite?,For which logarithm bases is this sum finite?,,"Lets have a recursive sequence $a_0 = 1$, $a_{n+1}=\log_{b} (1+a_n)$ and corresponding sum $\sum_{n=0}^\infty  (a_n)$. For which logarithm bases $b>2$ ( possibly for $b>e$) is the sum finite, if for any?

1,Prove that this iteration cuts a rational number in two irrationals $\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{q_n^2-p_n q_n+1}+\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{p_n}{q_n}$,Prove that this iteration cuts a rational number in two irrationals,\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{q_n^2-p_n q_n+1}+\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{p_n}{q_n},"For any $1 \leq p<q$ we have: $$\frac{p}{q}=\frac{1}{q^2-p q+1}+\frac{(q-p)(pq-1)}{q(q^2-p q+1)}$$ Let's consider an iteration: $$p_{n+1}=(q_n-p_n)(p_nq_n-1)$$ $$q_{n+1}=q_n(q_n^2-p_n q_n+1)$$ Then we have: $$\frac{p_0}{q_0}=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{q_n^2-p_n q_n+1}+\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{p_n}{q_n}$$ The above is trivially true, provided both limits exist separately. But it turns out numerically that both the sum and the limit are finite and (seemingly) irrational. Let's denote: $$A(p_0,q_0)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{q_n^2-p_n q_n+1}$$ $$B(p_0,q_0)=\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{p_n}{q_n}$$ $$A(p_0,q_0)+B(p_0,q_0)=\frac{p_0}{q_0}$$ We have (I will only write $A$ , since $B$ can be obtained by subtraction): $$A(1,2)=0.365624790175942982737859474249681505 \dots$$ $$A(1,3)=0.145650460727123812176794888179825955 \dots$$ $$A(2,3)=0.261766321023330525617942741920174815 \dots$$ $$A(3,4)=0.205525029400010131449324836277780238 \dots$$ Moreover, since we define 'numerators' and 'denominators' separately, we obtain different results for $A(mp_0,mq_0)$ : $$A(2,4)=0.1123721471627326977547524155555190359 \dots$$ $$A(3,6)=0.0527707965471706424044987365216530762 \dots$$ $$A(4,8)=0.0303300858480840619918350602972694890 \dots$$ $$A(4/3,8/3)=0.228842771329071793825717533784828873 \dots$$ I haven't been able to find a closed form for any of $A,B$ I tried. However, it seems likely they are irrational. If it's true and there is no known closed form, then we can produce an infinite number of pairs of irrationals $A,B$ which sum to a particular rational number nontrivially. My questions are: Can we prove that $A,B$ are irrational for rational $p_0,q_0$ ? Is there any closed form for $A,B$ in terms of $p_0,q_0$ ? Are the values of $A,B$ unique for every distinct pair of $p_0,q_0$ ? A sketch of a proof of existence for $B$ (note that we assume $p_0,q_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ and $1 \leq p_0 \leq q_0-1$ ): $$p_{n+1}=(q_n-p_n)(p_nq_n-1) \geq p_n^2+p_n-1$$ $$q_{n+1}=q_n+q_n^2(q_n-p_n) \geq q_n^2+q_n$$ We can see that $p_n,q_n$ are non-decreasing, and for $n>1$ they are increasing (because $q_n$ is strictly increasing and it 'helps' $p_n$ after the first step). For $n \to \infty$ we have $p_n \to \infty$ and $q_n \to \infty$ , thus: $$\frac{p_{n+1}}{q_{n+1}}=\frac{(q_n-p_n)(p_nq_n-1)}{q_n(q_n^2-p_n q_n+1)} \approx \frac{p_n}{q_n}$$ It is apparent the limit exists. The limit for $A$ exists because the sequence $q_n^2-p_n q_n+1$ grows much faster than $n^2$ and the sum obviously converges. Update A little something on a closed form. The system of recurrence relations can be rewritten as a single recurrence relation, using: $$p_n=q_n+\frac{1}{q_n}-\frac{q_{n+1}}{q_n^2}$$ Then we have a second order recurrence relation: $$q_{n+2}=q_{n+1}(q_{n+1}q_n+1)+\frac{q_{n+1}^3}{q_n^2} \left(\frac{q_{n+1}}{q_n}-1 \right)$$ $$q_0=q_0, \qquad q_1=q_0(q_0^2-q_0 p_0+1)$$ Or a more symmetric form: $$\frac{q_{n+2}}{q_{n+1}}=q_{n+1}q_n+1+\frac{q_{n+1}^2}{q_n^2} \left(\frac{q_{n+1}}{q_n}-1 \right)$$ If we find a closed form for it (which I'm not sure exists) we can take the limit and find the closed form for $B$ . We also have a more simple looking relation (but it still requires us to know $q_n$ ): $$\frac{p_n}{q_n}=1+\frac{1}{q_{n-1}^2}-\frac{q_{n-1}}{q_n}-\frac{q_n}{q_{n-1}^3}$$ And in fact, we can also write $A$ in terms of $q_n$ : $$A=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{q_n}{q_{n+1}}$$ Update 2 Getting rid of some unnecessary parts, we can reformulate the problem: Set some $q_1>q_0>0$ . Then we can define a second order recurrence: $$q_{n+2}=q_{n+1}(q_{n+1}q_n+1)+\frac{q_{n+1}^3}{q_n^2} \left(\frac{q_{n+1}}{q_n}-1 \right)$$ With the following property: $$L(q_0,q_1)-S(q_0,q_1)=\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{q_{n+1}}{q_n^3}- \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{q_n}{q_{n+1}}=\frac{q_1-q_0}{q_0^3}$$ Can we find a closed form for the recurrence? Or separately for the limit $L$ or the sum $S$ above? Note that for the limit $L$ to be finite we need to have as $ n \to \infty$ : $$q_n \asymp C \cdot a^{3^n}$$ For example we have: $$S(1,2)=0.645953147800624278311945190231458547= \\ = \frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{7}+\frac{1}{323}+\frac{1}{33657247}+\frac{1}{38127274806076464952763}+\dots$$ No closed form for this number either, however look at the denominator sequence - all the numbers end with $3$ or $7$ . This pattern continues as far as I can see.","For any we have: Let's consider an iteration: Then we have: The above is trivially true, provided both limits exist separately.

12,Euler's Refutation of Fermat's Conjecture,Euler's Refutation of Fermat's Conjecture,,"Fermat postulated that all numbers of the form $$2^{2^n}+1$$ are prime (where n = any integer). Then Euler came along with a rather ingenious proof that this was not, in fact the case. I came across this while reading William Dunham's Journey Through Genius, Chapter 10. Here's the gist of what I get so far (of how Euler refuted Fermat's above suggestion): Theorem A: If $a$ is an even number, and $p$ is prime that does not factor evenly into $a$ (but is a factor of $a+1$), then $p = 2k+1$ for an integer $k$. So far so good, and Dunham discusses the proof for this theorem, but I'm going to guess that you mathematicians here are familiar with this. Next we move onto Theorem B. Theorem B: If $a$ is an even number and p is a prime (not a factor of $a$), and $p$ goes evenly into $a^2+1$, then for an integer $k$, $p = 4k+1$, but $p$ cannot equal $4k+3$. Here's how this works: Firstly, $a$ is even, so $a^2$ is also even. Using Theorem A, it becomes obvious that any prime factor of $a^2+1$ is odd. Ergo, $p$ is odd (so it's not 2). If we divide $p$ by 4, then $p$ can equal either $4k+1$ or $4k+3$. Since $p$ is a divisor of $a^2+1$, p also divides evenly into the product ($a^2+1$)($a^{4k}-a^{4k-2}+a^{4k-4}...+a^4-a^2+1$). Algebraic manipulation shows that this product equals $a^{4k+2}+1$. And this is where I'm confused. Where on earth does Dunham pull ($a^{4k}-a^{4k-2}+a^{4k-4}...+a^4-a^2+1$) from? No explanation is offered on his part, so any enlightenment on this would be appreciated. More Details As stated earlier, if we divide $p$ by 4, then $p$ can equal either $4k+1$ or $4k+3$ (which is pretty clear if you plug in values for $k$). We want to demonstrate that $k$ can only equal $4k+1$, and we do this by proof by contradiction (assume $p=4k+3$). Why do we want to do this? Well, we want to know the form of $p$ so we can figure out the potential factors of $2^{32}+1$, which Fermat postulated was prime. Since $p$ is not a divisor of $a$ (by hypothesis), Fermat's little theorem would suggest that $p$ goes nicely into $a^{p-1}-1=a^{{4k+3}-1}-1=a^{4k+2}-1$. Says Dunham (p. 231): ""On the other hand, we have assumed that $p$ is a divisor of $a^2+1$, and consequently $p$ is also a divisor of the product ($a^2+1$)($a^{4k}-a^{4k-2}+a^{4k-4}...+a^4-a^2+1$)."" Since this product equals $a^{4k+2}+1$, and since $p$ goes evenly into both $a^{4k+2}+1$ and $a^{4k+2}-1$, $p$ is a divisor of ($a^{4k+2}+1$)-($a^{4k+2}-1$) = 2, but this cannot be true since $p$ is an odd prime.

Then $f$ is differentiable and $$f'(x) = \frac{1}{1+x} - 1 + x = \frac{x^{2}}{x+1}.$$ Therefore, $f'(x) = 0$ if and only if $x = 0$ and $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x>0$ . This means that $f$ attains its absolute minimum at 0 and so we have $$\log (x+1) -x+\frac{x^{2}}{2} = f(x) > f(0) = 0$$ for every $x>0$ , which implies that for all $x>0$ $$x-\frac{x^{2}}{2} < \log (x+1).$$ Similarly, define $g: \mathbb{R}_{0}^{+} \to \mathbb{R}$ by $g(x) = x- \log (x+1)$ . Then $g$ is differentiable and $$g'(x) = \frac{x}{x+1}.$$ Hence, a similar argument shows that $g$ attains its absolute minimum at 0 and, for every $x>0$ $$\log(x+1) < x.$$ This shows that $$x-\frac{x^{2}}{2} < \log (x+1) < x,\ \ \text{for all}\ x > 0.$$ Now note that, for every $1 \leq k \leq n$ , we have $$\log \left(1+\frac{1}{n^{2}}\right) + \log \left(1+\frac{2}{n^{2}}\right) + \ldots + \log\left(1+\frac{n}{n^{2}}\right)\\ < \frac{1}{n^{2}} + \frac{2}{n^{2}} + \ldots + \frac{n}{n^{2}}\\ = \frac{1+2+\ldots+n}{n^{2}} \\ = \frac{n(n+1)}{2n^{2}} $$ , and $$\log \left(1+\frac{1}{n^{2}}\right) + \log \left(1+\frac{2}{n^{2}}\right) + \ldots + \log\left(1+\frac{n}{n^{2}}\right)\\ > \frac{1}{n^{2}}-\frac{1}{2n^{4}} + \frac{2}{n^{2}}-\frac{4}{2n^{4}} + \ldots + \frac{n}{n^{2}}-\frac{n^{2}}{2n^{4}}\\ =  \frac{1+\ldots+n}{n^{2}} - \frac{1+4+\ldots+n^{2}}{4n^{4}}\\ = \frac{n(n+1)}{2n^{2}} - \frac{1+4+\ldots+n^{2}}{4n^{4}}.$$ This gives $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n(n+1)}{2n^{2}} - \frac{1+4+\ldots+n^{2}}{4n^{4}} = \frac{1}{2} - 0 = \frac{1}{2},$$ and $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n(n+1)}{2n^{2}} = \frac{1}{2},$$ which, by the squeeze theorem, implies that $$\lim_{n\to\infty} \log \left(1+\frac{1}{n^{2}}\right) + \log \left(1+\frac{2}{n^{2}}\right) + \ldots + \log\left(1+\frac{n}{n^{2}}\right) = \frac{1}{2}.$$ But then $$\lim_{n\to \infty}\prod_{k=1}^{n}\left(1+\frac{k}{n^{2}}\right) = e^{\lim_{n\to \infty}\log \left(\prod_{k=1}^{n}\left(1+\frac{k}{n^{2}}\right)\right)} = e^{\frac{1}{2}}.$$ I think the first part is correct but I don´t know if I´ve made some mistake with the arithmetic in the second part.

29,Sum of $\dfrac{1}{n^2+1}$ using Parseval's theorem,Sum of  using Parseval's theorem,\dfrac{1}{n^2+1},"I know this question has been widely answered here, but without using Fourier analysis.

First of Parseval's Theorem states: $\displaystyle{\dfrac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}[f(x)]^2 = [a_0]^2+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}[a_n]^2+[b_n]^2}$ . I calculate $a_0$ like $\frac{1}{2\,\pi}\,\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}f(x)\,\mathrm{dx}$ instead of $\frac{1}{\pi}\,\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}f(x)\,\mathrm{dx}$ , so no need for $\frac{1}{2}\,a_0$ Here I'd like to involve the series of $\cosh(x)$ whose partition I have been asked for in a prior question.

33,Unconditional convergence of a sum of elements in a complete Hausdorff topological ring.,Unconditional convergence of a sum of elements in a complete Hausdorff topological ring.,,"I'm not that familiar with theoretical math in general (I studied engineering), but I recently ended up down a theoretical rabbit hole that led me to the following question: Is there some type of well known property (e.g. locally compact, locally connected, regular) of a complete, Hausdorff topological ring $R$ that guarantees the following property: Let $\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} r_i$ unconditionally converge in $R$ , where $r_i \in R$ . Given any open set $S$ containing $0_R$ (the additive identity of the ring) there exists an open set $S'$ containing $0_R$ such that, given any finite subset $F$ of $S'$ and any sequence $f_i \in F$ , $\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} f_i r_i$ is in $S$ . This seems to be true if $R$ equals the real numbers with the usual topology, which I think I've proven: Let $r = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} |r_i|$ (we know a series of real numbers converges absolutely if it converges unconditionally) and choose $S$ to be the open ball of radius $\epsilon > 0$ centered at the origin. If $r=0$ , any choice of an open set $S'$ will do, so we'll move on to the harder case. If $r\ne0$ , then let $S'$ be the open ball of radius $\frac{\epsilon}{r}$ . Thus for any elements $f_i \in S'$ , $|f_i| < \frac{\epsilon}{r}$ .

Furthermore, let $I := \{(U,u) \ | \ U \in \mathcal{U}, u \in U \}$ be a directed set with the relation $(U,u) \triangleleft (V,v) $ iff $V \subseteq U$.I am trying to view the net over the set $I$ as a subnet of the sequence $e_n$ and then I would like to show that this subnet does indeed converge in the weak*-topology. I am not quite sure how to do this.

I would now like to show that I can still find a convergent subnet. It is clear to me that in compact spaces, every net has a convergent subnet, but I am struggling to prove the following: Let $N_k= \{n \in \mathbb{N}: n \ge k\}$ be a filterbasis and let $\mathcal{U}$ denote the utrafilter of the filter that is induced by the sets $N_k$. Furthermore, let $I := \{(U,u) \ | \ U \in \mathcal{U}, u \in U \}$ be a directed set with the relation $(U,u) \triangleleft (V,v) $ iff $V \subseteq U$.I am trying to view the net over the set $I$ as a subnet of the sequence $e_n$ and then I would like to show that this subnet does indeed converge in the weak*-topology.

43,Why do generalized Fourier series seem to converge to functions so far outside of the Hilbert space?,Why do generalized Fourier series seem to converge to functions so far outside of the Hilbert space?,,"My understanding is that one of the most important properties of a separable Hilbert space is that we can decompose its elements into generalized Fourier series. For example, consider a set of basis functions $f_n(x)$ that spans the Hilbert space $L^2(\mathbb{R})$. For any function $g(x) \in L^2(\mathbb{R})$, the generalized Fourier series $$\sum_{n = 0}^\infty \langle g, f_n \rangle\, f_n(x), \qquad \qquad \langle g, f \rangle := \int_{-\infty}^\infty g(x)\, f(x)\, dx$$ converges to $g(x)$ in the $L^2$ norm. (Sometimes we can make even stronger statements; for example, for the Hilbert space $L^2([0, 2\pi])$ with the standard basis functions $e^{i n \theta}$, Carleson's theorem guarantees that the (standard) Fourier series above converges to $g(x)$ almost everywhere. As shown here , this is not true in general.) However, the generalized Fourier series above seems to work much better than we might expect. That is, if we take a function $g(x)$ that does not lie in the Hilbert space and naively consider the above series, it appears to still converge to $g$. For example, the functions $g(x) \equiv 1$ and $g(x) = x^2$ obviously don't lie in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$. Nevertheless, when I try plotting the first few terms of the above generalized Fourier series with the Hermite basis functions , the series does indeed appear (by eye) to approach $g(x)$ more and more closely. The above generalized Fourier series makes formal sense for any function $g(x)$ such that the inner product $\langle g, f \rangle$ is defined. For basis functions (like the Hermite functions) that lie in Schwartz space , this space of functions $g$ is much larger than $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ and even incorporates some functions that diverge exponentially at infinity.

And $S(2)$ would generate $2,4,6,8,...$ which skips some and is also not acceptable. Is there a way of generating these orderings? There is clearly a null form $S(1)$ which could be considered the first. Added This process is manipulating an infinite sequence by applying $S$ repeatedly.

I start with the most simple integer sequence. $1,2,3,4,5,...$ Perhaps I want to swap pairs of them to become: $2,1,4,3,6,5,... = S(3,-1)$ meaning skip forward 3, then skip back 1 and repeat. or reverse triplets $3,2,1,6,5,4,9,... = S(5,-1,-1)$ meaning skip forward 4, then skip back 1, and once more back 1 and repeat. or something more complicated like $5,4,2,3,1,10,9,7,8,6,15... = S(9,-1,-2,1,-2)$ so I define a function $S(...)$ that can do that which takes as parameters as the sequence of steps in the original sequence to make the new one (I haven't explained that very well but bear with me). Now clearly I can code S without difficulty, I just need to retain enough history of the incoming sequence to jump back and forward as directed. Is there a name for this function $S$ or something similar? Is there a way of examining the parameters of S to determine whether the resulting sequence: emits all of the original sequence does not emit duplicates For example, $S(2,-1)$ would produce the sequence $2,1,3,2,4,3,...$ which is not acceptable because 2 gets repeated. And $S(2)$ would generate $2,4,6,8,...$ which skips some and is also not acceptable. Is there a way of generating these orderings? There is clearly a null form $S(1)$ which could be considered the first. Added This process is manipulating an infinite sequence by applying $S$ repeatedly. The two requirements apply to the whole infinite sequence generated. So, for example $S(24,-23)$ is invalid because eventually a duplicate will arise even though the first iteration does not.",,['sequences-and-series']

It is well known that this  function is holomorphic on the upper half plane $\mathbb{H}$, and I made sure to understand well and wrote down a detailed proof of this before asking this question. The context of my question is as follows Let $F = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})$ be a real quadratic field, with $d > 0$ a positive square-free integer such that $d \equiv 2, 3 \pmod{4}$. Assume also that $F$ has class number $1$. Also its ring of integers is $\mathcal{O}_F = \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}] = \mathbb{Z} \oplus\sqrt{d} \, \mathbb{Z} = \{ n + m\sqrt{d} \mid n, m \in \mathbb{Z} \}$.

Now for $z = (z_1, z_2) \in \mathbb{H} \times \mathbb{H}$ and $\alpha \in F$, we define the ""trace"" as follows $\operatorname{Tr}(\alpha z) := \sigma_1(\alpha) z_1 + \sigma_2(\alpha) z_2 = \alpha z_1 + \alpha' z_2$, where we wrote $\alpha'$ for the conjugate of $\alpha$. Finally we define the holomorphic Hilbert modular theta function $\vartheta: \mathbb{H} \times \mathbb{H} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ by $$ \vartheta(z) := \vartheta(z_1, z_2) := \sum_{x \in \mathcal{O}_F} e^{\pi i \operatorname{Tr}(x^2 z)} $$ I'm trying to prove the absolute convergence of this infinite series. The argument I found online To prove the convergence of the series, it is compared to the Jacobi theta function defined above. To be precise, the author observes that $$ |\vartheta(z)| = \left| \sum_{x \in \mathcal{O}_F} e^{\pi i \operatorname{Tr}(x^2 z)} \right| = \left| \sum_{x \in \mathcal{O}_F} e^{\pi i x^2 z_1} e^{\pi i x'^2 z_2} \right| \leq \left| \sum_{x \in \mathcal{O}_F} e^{2 \pi i x^2 z_1} \right|^{1/2}  \left| \sum_{x \in \mathcal{O}_F} e^{2 \pi i x'^2 z_2} \right|^{1/2} $$ where apparently the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality has been used in the last step, although I'm not convinced that it is true as stated. In any case, then it is noted that since the Jacobi theta function defined above $\displaystyle{\theta(\tau) = \sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty} e^{2 \pi i n^2 \tau }}$ is holomorphic on $\mathbb{H}$, then each of the two series on the right hand side of the above inequality are absolutely convergent on compact sets in $\mathbb{H}$, so that the original series $\vartheta(z_1, z_2)$ converges absolutely on compact subests of $\mathbb{H} \times \mathbb{H}$.

85,A curious identity on sums of secants,A curious identity on sums of secants,,"I was working on proving a variant of Markov's inequality, and in doing so I managed to come across an interesting (conjectured) identity for any $n\in\mathbb{N}$: $$\sum_{m=0}^{n-1} \sec^2\left(\dfrac{(2m+1)\pi}{4n}\right)=2n^2.$$ I tried to prove this via induction, averaging arguments, trig identities, etc., but to no avail. Are there any suggestions on where this identity may be proven or how I should proceed?","I was working on proving a variant of Markov's inequality, and in doing so I managed to come across an interesting (conjectured) identity for any $n\in\mathbb{N}$: $$\sum_{m=0}^{n-1} \sec^2\left(\dfrac{(2m+1)\pi}{4n}\right)=2n^2.$$ I tried to prove this via induction, averaging arguments, trig identities, etc., but to no avail.

86,Permute the values in each row in a matrix such that the columns sum to the same amount.,Permute the values in each row in a matrix such that the columns sum to the same amount.,,"The general problem Given a matrix, I would like to permute the order of values in each row, so that all the columns of the matrix sums to the same value. A simple example For example, given: 0     0     2     6  0     0     6    18  0     0    10    30  0     0    14    42  0     0    18    54  0     0    22    66 One solution is: 0     0     2     6  0    18     6     0 30     0    10     0 42     0    14     0  0    54    18     0  0     0    22    66 Notice that each column sums to 72. Of course, the solution is not unique; one may permute the columns themselves to obtain different solutions, such as: 0     0     2     6 18     0     6     0  0    30    10     0  0    42    14     0 54     0    18     0  0     0    22    66 The specific problem Here I am looking at a simple $30 \times 5$ matrix. The matrix is defined thus: the contents of row $n$ is $[0, 0, 2f(n), 6f(n), 12f(n)+2]$ where $f(n) = 4n^2+4n+1$ and $n = 0, 1, 2, ...,29$. Here is what the matrix looks like: 0           0           2           6          14        0           0          18          54         110        0           0          50         150         302        0           0          98         294         590        0           0         162         486         974        0           0         242         726        1454        0           0         338        1014        2030        0           0         450        1350        2702        0           0         578        1734        3470        0           0         722        2166        4334        0           0         882        2646        5294        0           0        1058        3174        6350        0           0        1250        3750        7502        0           0        1458        4374        8750        0           0        1682        5046       10094        0           0        1922        5766       11534        0           0        2178        6534       13070        0           0        2450        7350       14702        0           0        2738        8214       16430        0           0        3042        9126       18254        0           0        3362       10086       20174        0           0        3698       11094       22190        0           0        4050       12150       24302        0           0        4418       13254       26510        0           0        4802       14406       28814        0           0        5202       15606       31214        0           0        5618       16854       33710        0           0        6050       18150       36302        0           0        6498       19494       38990        0           0        6962       20886       41774 Obviously, the desired sum for each column is equal to the sum of all elements in the matrix divided by the number of columns. Here it is $\frac{1}{5}\left(60 + 20\sum_{n=0}^{29} f(n)\right) = 143972$. We certainly cannot do this by brute force: For an $m\times n$ matrix the number of possibilities are: $(n!)^m$ which combinatorially explodes. Here, two of the columns given are zeros so we have $\left(\frac{n!}{2}\right)^m$ unique ways to permute the values of each row - which is not much better. Fortunately, this matrix has a well-defined pattern to it, and I am wondering: can this pattern can be exploited to derive solutions more easily? EDIT: I have made a recursive depth-first search to find solutions. On each iteration, it attempts to construct a vector that sums to the desired result (in this case 143972) by choosing each entry in the vector from a different row in the matrix. Once one such vector has been created, it removes the chosen entries from the matrix thereby changing it from an $m\times n$ matrix to an $m \times n-1$ one. This repeats until either no solution can be found, or a the matrix becomes empty. In the worst case, it runs on the order of $n^m$ for an $m\times n$ matrix (but it turns out that finding one solution is fast because my matrix has many, many solutions apparently). Here are three sample solutions I have found using this approach: Solution 1 6          14           0           0           2        0          54          18         110           0       50

But I still don't know whether there's a way to count the number of solutions, or how to generate more solutions more efficiently. And my depth-first-search algorithm is a rather brute-force way that doesn't take advantage of the known sequence that the original matrix is made up of.","The general problem Given a matrix, I would like to permute the order of values in each row, so that all the columns of the matrix sums to the same value. A simple example For example, given: 0     0     2     6  0     0     6    18  0     0    10    30  0     0    14    42  0     0    18    54  0     0    22    66 One solution is: 0     0     2     6  0    18     6     0 30     0    10     0 42     0    14     0  0    54    18     0  0     0    22    66 Notice that each column sums to 72. Of course, the solution is not unique; one may permute the columns themselves to obtain different solutions, such as: 0     0     2     6 18     0     6     0  0    30    10     0  0    42    14     0 54     0    18     0  0     0    22    66 The specific problem Here I am looking at a simple $30 \times 5$ matrix. The matrix is defined thus: the contents of row $n$ is $[0, 0, 2f(n), 6f(n), 12f(n)+2]$ where $f(n) = 4n^2+4n+1$ and $n = 0, 1, 2, ...,29$. Here is what the matrix looks like: 0           0           2           6          14        0           0          18          54         110        0           0          50         150         302        0           0          98         294         590        0           0         162         486         974        0           0         242         726        1454        0           0         338        1014        2030        0           0         450        1350        2702        0           0         578        1734        3470        0           0         722        2166        4334        0           0         882        2646        5294        0           0        1058        3174        6350        0           0        1250        3750        7502        0           0        1458        4374        8750        0           0        1682        5046       10094        0           0        1922        5766       11534        0           0        2178        6534       13070        0           0        2450        7350       14702        0           0        2738        8214       16430        0           0        3042        9126       18254        0           0        3362       10086       20174        0           0        3698       11094       22190        0           0        4050       12150       24302        0           0        4418       13254       26510        0           0        4802       14406       28814        0           0        5202       15606       31214        0           0        5618       16854       33710        0           0        6050       18150       36302        0           0        6498       19494       38990        0           0        6962       20886       41774 Obviously, the desired sum for each column is equal to the sum of all elements in the matrix divided by the number of columns. Here it is $\frac{1}{5}\left(60 + 20\sum_{n=0}^{29} f(n)\right) = 143972$. We certainly cannot do this by brute force: For an $m\times n$ matrix the number of possibilities are: $(n!)^m$ which combinatorially explodes. Here, two of the columns given are zeros so we have $\left(\frac{n!}{2}\right)^m$ unique ways to permute the values of each row - which is not much better. Fortunately, this matrix has a well-defined pattern to it, and I am wondering: can this pattern can be exploited to derive solutions more easily? EDIT: I have made a recursive depth-first search to find solutions. On each iteration, it attempts to construct a vector that sums to the desired result (in this case 143972) by choosing each entry in the vector from a different row in the matrix. Once one such vector has been created, it removes the chosen entries from the matrix thereby changing it from an $m\times n$ matrix to an $m \times n-1$ one. This repeats until either no solution can be found, or a the matrix becomes empty. In the worst case, it runs on the order of $n^m$ for an $m\times n$ matrix (but it turns out that finding one solution is fast because my matrix has many, many solutions apparently). Here are three sample solutions I have found using this approach: Solution 1 6          14           0           0           2        0          54          18         110           0       50

Note that 3rd column elements are always present F1,F2 F4,F5,F6 (F1,F2),(F1,F2,F4), (F1,F2,F5), (F1,F2,F6), (F1,F2,F4,F5), (F1,F2,F4,F6), (F1,F2,F5,F6), (F1,F2,F4,F5,F6) So that, considering another example (i.e the 2nd example mentioned above), we have: Produced sets (note several incremental duplicates) Using operators in 3rd and 4th column Produced sets (note there are no duplicates). Order in a set is not important, (a,b)=(b,a) CUBE(F3,F5,F7) F3,F5,F7,(F3,F5),(F3,F7),(F5,F7),(F3,F5,F7),(), GROUPING SETS(CUBE(F3,F5,F7)) F3,F5,F7,(F3,F5),(F3,F7),(F5,F7),(F3,F5,F7),(), CUBE(F3,F5,F8) F3,F5,F8,(F3,F5),(F3,F8),(F5,F8),(F3,F5,F8),(), GROUPING SETS(F8), GROUPING SETS(CUBE(F3,F5)) F8,(F3,F8),(F5,F8),(F3,F5,F8) CUBE(F3,F6,F7) F3,F6,F7,(F3,F6),(F3,F7),(F6,F7),(F3,F6,F7),(), GROUPING SETS(F6), GROUPING SETS(CUBE(F3,F7)) F6,(F3,F6),(F6,F7),(F3,F6,F7) CUBE(F3,F6,F8) F3,F6,F8,(F3,F6),(F3,F8),(F6,F8),(F3,F6,F8),(), GROUPING SETS(F6,F8), GROUPING SETS(CUBE(F3)) (F6,F8),(F3,F6,F8) CUBE(F4,F5,F7) F4,F5,F7,(F4,F5),(F4,F7),(F5,F7),(F4,F5,F7),(), GROUPING SETS(F4), GROUPING SETS(CUBE(F5,F7)) F4,(F4,F5),(F4,F7),(F4,F5,F7) CUBE(F4,F5,F8) F4,F5,F8,(F4,F5),(F4,F8),(F5,F8),(F4,F5,F8),(), GROUPING SETS(F4,F8), GROUPING SETS(CUBE(F5)) (F4,F8),(F4,F5,F8) CUBE(F4,F6,F7) F4,F6,F7,(F4,F6),(F4,F7),(F6,F7),(F4,F6,F7),(), GROUPING SETS(F4,F6), GROUPING SETS(CUBE(F7)) (F4,F6),(F4,F6,F7) CUBE(F4,F6,F8) F4,F6,F8,(F4,F6),(F4,F8),(F6,F8),(F4,F6,F8),(), GROUPING SETS(F4,F6,F8) (F4,F6,F8) At the end we have 27 distinct sets and we produce the same distinct sets incrementing row by row.",,"['sequences-and-series', 'combinatorics', 'algorithms', 'combinations']"
