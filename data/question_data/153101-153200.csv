Then, we have; $a^2 + b^2 - 1 = c^2$ and $b^2 - a^2 + 1 = d^2$ by adding $2b^2 = c^2 + d^2$, hence  $c^2 - b^2 = b^2 - d^2$ $$\frac{c-b}{b-d} = \frac{b+d}{b+c} = \frac{m}{n}$$ say, where $\gcd(m,n)=1$, $n\gt m$. Hence $$\begin{align*} -nb +nc &= -md + mb\\ b(m+n) -nc &= md\\ nd + nb &= mb + mc\\ b(n-m) &= mc - nd \end{align*}$$ I am so sorry...thereafter what to do and how to complete this problem, I don't know. If any one can solve, I am so grateful to them or discuss some other method to complete this problem.",,"['number-theory', 'elementary-number-theory', 'diophantine-equations']"
13,When is $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{n^k}{3^n}$ an integer?,When is  an integer?,\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{n^k}{3^n},"The motivation for this was to find some nice expression for the sum $$\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{P(n)}{b^n}$$ where $P(n)$ is a polynomial and $b$ is a positive integer greater than 1. Clearly, it suffices to find sums of the form $\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{n^k}{b^n}$ for integer k. If we set $b=2$, a simple translation and subtraction of the terms in the series shows that $f(k)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{n^k}{2^n}$ satisfies the recurrence relation $f(k)=\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}{k \choose i}f(i)$, producing the series $2,2,6,26,...$ ( A076726 in OEIS). If $b>2$, a similar argument shows that the recurrence is $$f(k)=\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}\frac{{k \choose i}f(i)}{b-1}$$ When b=3, the series is as follows: $\frac{3}{2},\frac{3}{4},\frac{3}{2},\frac{33}{8},15,\frac{273}{4},\frac{1491}{4},\frac{38001}{16},17295,...$ The series takes on integer values at strange places; the first several such values are 4, 8, 12, 13, 16, 20, 24, 32, ...

The odd numbers that take on integer values are frequently separated by powers of 2; if I recall correctly, the next odd number after 13 is 77=13+64. Curiously, there appear to be $no$ integer values for $b>3$. Does anyone know why these patterns should occur? If nothing else, more data on these values would be great (the few programming languages I'm competent in weren't able to handle large numbers very well, and I've lost the data up to 1024 that I used to have).","The motivation for this was to find some nice expression for the sum $$\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{P(n)}{b^n}$$ where $P(n)$ is a polynomial and $b$ is a positive integer greater than 1.

All numbers will be considered positive integers in the following unless stated otherwise. I was thinking as follows: odd numbers will always work since if we take an odd $m$ , we have $$ m=2\cdot k+1=k+(k+1). $$ Then I realised that all numbers having at least one odd prime factor will also work. Take $n$ as a number having an odd prime factor and let this odd prime factor be $m$ and let $n=m\cdot k$ . Then $$ n=\underbrace{k+k+\ldots+k}_{m \ \text{times}} $$ and since $m$ is odd, say $m=2\cdot l+1$ we have $$ n=\underbrace{k+k+\ldots+k}_{l \ \text{times}}+k+\underbrace{k+k+\ldots+k}_{l \ \text{times}} $$ and we can start moving $1$ s one by one from the left side of the middle "" $k$ "" to the right side of it $$ n=\underbrace{k+k+\ldots+(k-1)}_{l \ \text{times}}+k+\underbrace{(k+1)+k+\ldots+k}_{l \ \text{times}} $$ $$ n=\underbrace{k+k+\ldots(k-2)+(k-1)}_{l \ \text{times}}+k+\underbrace{(k+1)+(k+2)+\ldots+k}_{l \ \text{times}} $$ this way we end up in a sum of consecutive integers. It may happen that some integers on the left will be negative which is undesired but since these numbers are consecutive integers we always be able to cancel out the negative ones without disturbing the structure of the uncancelled ones. To see this in action let us take $22=11\cdot 2$ . This would give $$ 2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2 $$ so $$ 2+2+2+2+1+2+3+2+2+2+2 $$ the next step gives $$ 2+2+2+0+1+2+3+4+2+2+2 $$ it seems that now we are out of numbers but we just continue moving an increasing number of $1$ s to the right $$ 2+2+(-1)+0+1+2+3+4+5+2+2 $$ $$ 2+(-2)+(-1)+0+1+2+3+4+5+6+2 $$ finally $$ \underbrace{(-3)+(-2)+(-1)+0+1+2+3}_{=0}+4+5+6+7 $$ so we get $$ 22=4+5+6+7. $$ Now we have a method to generate the desired expression for all odd numbers and all the ones having at least one odd prime factor. Which numbers are left? The ones having ONLY even primes in their prime factorisation. These are of the form $2^n$ . I was thinking what do these have in common and I thought that they are separated by a factor of $2$ . The first of these are $1$ for $n=0$ and $1$ cannot be expressed in the desired for so if I could show that $$ m \ \text{cannot be expressed}\Rightarrow 2m \ \text{cannot be expressed} $$ I am done. So I was trying to show the contrapositive $$ 2m \ \text{can be expressed}\Rightarrow m \ \text{can be expressed}. $$ So assume that $2m$ can be expressed. Now, eihter $m$ is odd in which case we are done since odds were easy to express or it is even, that is $m=2l$ . From here the argument repeats.

A highly upvoted answer by Ege Erdil made the point that all the primes of the form $p=15n+8$ qualify. They then called upon Dirichlet's theorem of primes in an arithmetic progression to reach an affirmative answer. I would like to see an ""elementary"" proof of the infinitude of primes in an arithmetic progression that fits in here. So I generalize Ege's recipe to the following question: Is there an example of a pair of integers $(a,n)$ such that $\gcd(a-2,n)>1$ , $\gcd(a+2,n)>1$ , and that there is an elementary proof for the infinitude of primes $p\equiv a\pmod n$ ? Your definition of ""elementary"" may vary. I'm leaving that somewhat open on purpose, but at least anything more elementary than $L$ -functions will qualify. This may prove to be taxing. There is no shortage of elementary proofs for the infinitude of primes in an arithmetic progression on our site: $p\equiv\pm1\pmod4$ (many threads), $p\equiv1\pmod5$ , $p\equiv3\pmod8$ , $p\equiv1\pmod n$ , $p\equiv-1\pmod 6$ , $p\equiv7\pmod{12}$ . However, those methods don't really work for the purposes of my question. That's because there is a deeper result due to Murty and Thain , locally referred to here , stating that a ""Euclid style"" proof for the infinitude of prime $p\equiv a\pmod n$ exists if and only if $a^2\equiv1\pmod n$ . This rules out Euclid style proofs as an option. For if $a^2\equiv1\pmod n$ , then $n\mid a^2-1$ . But, together with this, the conditions $\gcd(a-2,n)>1$ and $\gcd(a+2,n)>1$ imply that $$1<\gcd((a-2)(a+2),n)=\gcd(a^2-4,n)=\gcd(3,n).$$ That gcd can thus only be $3$ , but it is obvious that $3$ cannot be a factor of both $a-2$ and $a+2$ . So something else is needed! This may be a tall order, but I'm asking this in case this rings a bell. A ""Euclid style"" proof means roughly the following: Assume that we have an exhaustive (finite) list of primes $p_1,\ldots,p_k$ in a given residue class. Then a cleverly chosen polynomial $P$ evaluated at $p_1p_2\cdots p_k$ can be shown to have a prime factor in this residue class, but not equal to any of $p_i$ .

32,Fibonacci-like sequences mod $p$ where $a_{n+1}$ only really depends on $a_n$.,Fibonacci-like sequences mod  where  only really depends on .,p a_{n+1} a_n,"Consider a prime $p$ and a sequence $(a_n)_{n\ge 0}$ in $\mathbb{F}_p$ satisfying $a_{n+2}=a_{n+1}+a_n$ for all $n\ge 0$ . Now, assume that each element of the sequence only really depends on the previous one. That is, assume there exists a function $f:\mathbb{F}_p\to\mathbb{F}_p$ such that $a_{n+1}=f(a_n)$ for all $n\ge 0$ . If $p\not\in\{2,5\}$ and $5$ is a quadratic residue mod $p$ there are the obvious sequences $$\left(c\left[\frac12+\frac12\sqrt5\right]^n\right)_{n\ge 0}\quad\text{and}\quad\left(c\left[\frac12-\frac12\sqrt5\right]^n\right)_{n\ge 0}$$ for $c\in\mathbb{F}_p$ any constant, but are there any others? Computational results by @Servaes Let's call two Fibonacci-like sequences modulo $p$ equivalent if they can be turned into each other through shifting and multiplication by units, then any sequence where each element is a function of the previous and and which is not equivalent to $$(0)_{n\ge 0},\quad (c^n)_{n\ge 0}$$ where $c^2=c+1$ , is called strange . @Servaes has shown through computation that the first few primes for which strange sequences exist are $$199, 211, 233, 281, 421, 461, 521, 557, 859, 911.$$ Own work For any prime $p$ let $\pi(p)$ be the Pisano period mod $p$ (so this is not the prime counting function) Claim: Let $p$ be a prime, $(a_n)_{n\ge 0}$ a strange sequence. Then it has period $\pi(p)$ . Proof: Let $A=\{a_n:n\ge 0\}$ be the set of attained values and $f:A\to A$ the function which makes this sequence strange, in the sense that $a_{n+1}=f(a_n)$ for all $n\ge 0$ . Clearly, $f$ is a bijection. It is easily proved that, for all $a\in A$ and $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ , $$f^n(a)=F_{n-1}a+F_nf(a).$$ Let $m$ be the period of $(a_n)_{n\ge 0}$ , then clearly $m$ is the smallest positive integer $n$ for which $f^n=\operatorname{id}_A$ . Thus, for all $a\in A$ , $$(1-F_{m-1})a=F_mf(a)$$ If $F_m\neq 0$ it follows that $f(a)=F_m^{-1}(1-F_{m-1})a$ and the sequence is equivalent to $\left(c^n\right)_{n\ge 0}$ where $c=F_m^{-1}(1-F_{m-1})$ satisfies $c^2=c+1$ . This contradicts our assumption that the sequence is strange, so $F_m=0$ . Since the sequence is not the null sequence, we may take $a\in A$ non-zero and conclude that $F_{m-1}=1$ . It follows that $\pi(p)\mid m$ . Since $$f^{\pi(p)}(a)=F_{\pi(p)-1}a+F_{\pi(p)}f(a)=F_{-1}a+F_0F(a)=a,$$ the opposite division relation holds as well and we are done.

56,Summation of fractional parts of $x/n$,Summation of fractional parts of,x/n,"Let us consider the sums $$\displaystyle T_1(x)=\sum_{n\geq a\sqrt{x}}^{b \sqrt{x}} \left\{ \frac{x}{n} \right\} \\T_2(x)=\sum_{n\geq a\sqrt{x}}^{b \sqrt{x}} \left\{ \frac{x}{2n} \right\}   $$ where $x$ is a positive integer, $0\leq a<b\leq 1$ , $n$ runs over all integers in the interval $[a \sqrt{x}, b\sqrt{x}]$ , and $\{ \}$ indicates the fractional part. Because of the equidistribution of such fractional parts, the plots of $T_1(x)$ and $T_2(x)$ versus $x$ show oscillations around the line $\frac{b-a}{2} \sqrt{x}$ . By experimental calculations, I noted that the average value of the difference between $T_1(x)$ (or $T_2(x)$ ) and $\frac{b-a}{2} \, \sqrt{x}$ , calculated over all positive integers $x \leq N$ , is $O(1)$ . In particular, we have $$\lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{x=1}^{N} \left( T_1(x)- \frac{b-a}{2} \sqrt{x} \right)= K_1(a,b)\\ \lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{x=1}^{N} \left( T_2(x)- \frac{b-a}{2} \sqrt{x} \right)= K_2(a,b)$$ where $K_1(a,b)$ and $K_2(a,b)$ are constant terms that depend on $a$ and $b$ , indicating that the distributions of such differences are biased. The problem can be simplified by considering the case where $b=1$ (once solved this case, the general case with $b<1$ can be solved by difference). In this case, the biases are determined only by $a$ . For example, analyzing the distributions of differences over all integers $N$ up to $2500$ , setting $a=0.5$ we have $K_1(0.5,1)\approx -0.370...$ and $K_2(0.5,1)\approx -0.169...$ , with rather slow convergence rates. I wonder how these terms are generated and whether they could be exactly calculated. Again based on experimental results, it seems that $K_1$ and $K_2$ have a logarithmic relation with $a$ , with values near to $\frac{1}{2} \log(a)$ and $\frac{1}{4} \log(a)$ , respectively. This question is somewhat linked to this other one, for which a nice answer was previously given.

Valid moves are: subtract $1$ divide by $2$ , applicable if $n \equiv 0 \pmod{2}$ divide by $3$ , applicable if $n \equiv 0 \pmod{3}$ For example, you can reduce 10 in 3 steps: $10 \rightarrow^{-1} 9 \rightarrow^{/3} 3 \rightarrow^{/3} 1$ . Let's define $f(n)$ as the answer for number $n$ . Then we have $f(1) = 0$ and for $n > 1$ : $f(n) = 1 + \min \{ f(n-1), (n \mod 2) + f(\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor), (n\mod 3) + f(\lfloor\frac{n}{3}\rfloor) \}$ $n$ is restricted to $10^9$ in the original source, which makes it easy to solve in $O(n)$ using dynamic programming or a breadth-first search, but that isn't really interesting. Initially I thought that the tricky range for $n$ would only be small (below $10^6$ or so) and for larger $n$ we could apply some simple greedy algorithm that prefers division by 3 or 4, even if we need to subtract 1 first. I tried to test some identities that could lead to such a heuristic: $f(n) = 1 + f(n - 1)  \ \ \forall n: n \equiv 1,5 \pmod{6}$ (that's easy to prove, because there's only one valid move) $f(n) = \min \{ f(\frac{n}{2}), f(\frac{n}{3}) \} \ \ \forall n: n \equiv 0 \pmod{6}$ $f(3n) \geq f(n)$ $f(n) = f(\frac{n}{3})  \ \ \forall n: n \equiv 0 \pmod{3^3}$ $f(n) = f(\frac{n}{3})  \ \ \forall n: n \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \textbf{ and } n \not\equiv 0 \pmod{2}$ ... But all but the first three have turned out not to be correct, and those are not very helpful because you still have a branching factor of 2.
