1,Using Lagrange Multipliers to find the largest possible area of a rectangular box with diagonal length L.,Using Lagrange Multipliers to find the largest possible area of a rectangular box with diagonal length L.,,"I am trying to find the largest possible area of a rectangular box having diagonal length L, by method of Lagrange Multipliers. Here is my approach: Let $f(x,y) = xy$ define the area of a rectangular box with length $x$, width $y$. By Pythagorean Theorem, $L^2 = x^2 + y^2$, so that $L = \sqrt{x^2+y^2}$. Define the constraint function $G(x,y) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - L$ Computing the gradients, $\nabla f(x,y) = (y,x)$ $\nabla G(x,y) = (x(x^2+y^2)^{-1/2}, y(x^2+y^2)^{-1/2})$ Then by method of Lagrange Multipliers, $$ y = \lambda x(x^2 + y^2)^{-1/2} $$ $$ x = \lambda y (x^2+y^2)^{-1/2}$$ It is clear to me that one candidate for a critical point is when $x = y = 0$ (from the gradient of f), and $f(0,0) = 0$. With some algebra you can also determine that $x^2 = y^2$ so that $x = y$. But that's as far as I can go. As I don't have any numerical values, I assume I'm finding a general expression that determines the largest possible area of the box.

2,Problem with Understanding Proof of the Multivariable Mean Value Theorem,Problem with Understanding Proof of the Multivariable Mean Value Theorem,,"I have some questions concerning a proof of the Mean Value Theorem from Bredon's book that I find rather cryptical. Theorem: Let $f : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ be $C^1$. Let $x := (x_1, \dots , x_n)$ and let $x' := (x'_{1}, \dots , x'_n)$. Then there exists a $x^* := (x^*_{1}, \dots , x^*_n)$ on the line segment between $x$ and $x'$ such that $$ f(x) - f(x') = \sum^{n}_{i = 1} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} (x^*) (x - x').$$ Proof: Apply the Mean Value Theorem found in any calculus book to the function $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by $t \mapsto f(tx + (1-t)x')$ and use the Chain Rule:   $$ \frac{d f(tx + (1-t)x')}{dt} \Bigg|_{t = t^*} = % \sum^{n}_{i = 1} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} (x^*) \frac{d (tx_i + (1-t)x'_i)}{dt} \Bigg|_{t = t^*} = % \sum^{n}_{i = 1} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} (x^*) (x_i - x'_i )$$   with $x^* := t^* x + (1 - t^* )x' $. I have the following problems. Why $t \mapsto f(tx + (1-t)x')$ is defined on $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ ? I think it should rather be defined on $[0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ (i.e., it should be convex and not affine), since we want to capture that $x^* \in f(t^* x + (1 - t^* )x')$ for some $t^* \in [0,1]$. If $t \mapsto f(tx + (1-t)x')$ is defined on $[0,1]$ then I can almost get what happens in the equation. That is, things should work as follows: start from $t \mapsto f(tx + (1-t)x')$ and apply calculus Mean Value Theorem getting \begin{align} \frac{f(x) - f(x')}{?} & = \frac{df}{dt} (t^*) \\ & = \sum^{n}_i \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} (x^*). \end{align} Notice that at the denominator on the LHS I put a question mark because I don't see how it should work. We should get $(x - x')$, but I don't really see how. Or better, I see it, if the denominator works as $$ (1x + (1-1)x' - 0x + (1-0)x' ),$$ which is indeed equal to $(x - x')$, but to me this is not clear at all. Indeed it should simply be equal to $1$, because we are acting on the domain of $t \mapsto f(tx + (1-t)x')$, that should be just $[0, 1]$, not on its codomain. [The RHS should be OK, since we have that there is a $t^*$ and then we use it to define $x^*$.] How should this actually work? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated since I am self-taught and I think I never really got how these analysis proofs with differentiation actually work.

Quasiconvexity of a function $f: \mathbb{R}^{m\times d} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ means that for any bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d:$ $$\int_{\Omega}f(C + \nabla \omega(y))dy \ge | \Omega | f(C), $$ for any $\omega \in W_0^{1,\infty}(\Omega)$. Now let us consider two matrices $A, B$ that are rank one connected, through $A-B = \xi \otimes \eta.$ Wlog we assume that $\eta = e_1 \in \mathbb{R^d}$ (else we rotate everything). We want to prove that $$f (\theta A + (1-\theta)B) \le \theta f(A) + (1-\theta) f(B)$$ So let us define $C = \theta A + (1-\theta)B$ and $ \Omega = (0,1)^d$ and $$ \omega(y) =  \begin{cases} (1-\theta) (x \cdot e_1) \xi, \text{   if   } 0 \le x \cdot e_1 \le \theta \\ \\ -\theta (x \cdot e_1 -1) \xi, \text{   if   } \theta < x \cdot e_1 \le 1 \end{cases} $$ Now we find that the gradient of $\omega$ is: $$\nabla \omega (y) = \begin{cases} (1-\theta)\xi \otimes e_1, \text{   if   } 0 \le x \cdot e_1 \le \theta \\ \\ -\theta \xi \otimes e_1, \text{   if   } \theta < x \cdot e_1 \le 1 \end{cases}$$ So eventually we find: $$\theta f(A) + (1-\theta) f(B) = \int_{\Omega}f(C + \nabla \omega(y))dy \ge f(C)$$ where the latter inequality holds by quasiconvexity. A proof of this fact is given for example by Dacorogna in ""Direct methods for calculus of variations,"" but it is actually more complicated.",,"['real-analysis', 'multivariable-calculus', 'convex-analysis', 'calculus-of-variations']"

First path is along curve $y=2x^2$ Second path is curve described by $x=t^2$ and $y=2t$ Last path is the path that goes from $(0,0)$ to $(2,0)$ along the x-axis and then along line $(2,0)$ to $(1,2)$. This is what I have so far. For the first one: $$\int F(x,y)\cdot dr=\int ((x^2-y^2)+(-2xy)4t)  dt$$ I said $r(t)=x(t)$ x + $y(t)$ y . Therefore $dr=(1$ x +$4t$ y )dt. This part is algebra and derivatives.

AT THE SAME TIME , it is a normal to the level curve (to my understanding, it means when z is fixed at a particular value, a vector that is perpendicular to the tangent of a curve at a particular point. The gradient points to the concave side of the level curve). Combining the two ideas above, I assume it is correct that a normal to the level curve is the same as the direction in which z will increase most rapidly (although I am unsure why it is true). Somehow, then I thought that gradient points to the direction where a tangent line to the 3D object is, because gradient points to the direction of the steepest slope. And then in the following topic of tangent planes, now it tells me that gradient is actually a normal line instead of a tangent line to a 3D object? What a surprise!
