0,Origin of well-ordering proof of uniqueness in the FToArithmetic,Origin of well-ordering proof of uniqueness in the FToArithmetic,,"In the Appendix to Ivan Niven's book ""Numbers: Rational and Irrational"", he proves the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (FToA) without using Euclid's Lemma that if a prime divides a product, then it divides one of the factors of the product.  Niven's proof instead uses well-ordering. He assumes that m is the smallest positive integer with two different prime factorizations, say $$ m=p_1 p_2 p_3 \ldots p_r \qquad \text{and} \qquad m=q_1 q_2 q_3 \ldots q_s $$ Typically, Euclid's Lemma would now be invoked repeatedly to say that each prime in one factorization of a number must also occur in any other, giving a contradiction. (Or more typically, this idea is rewritten as a direct proof.) Niven instead proceeds saying that the two factorizations cannot have a prime in common, since if they did, we could assume without loss of generality that p_1 = q_1.  Then $m/p_1$ would be a positive integer smaller than $m$ with the two different factorizations $$ m/p_1 = p_2 p_3 \ldots p_r \qquad \text{and} \qquad m/p_1 = q_2 q_3 \ldots q_s, $$ a contradiction.

7,Potentially new approach to factoring big numbers,Potentially new approach to factoring big numbers,,"Update on 5/27/2020: I summarized all discussions related to this post, added a bit more about computational complexity, and published it on my blog, here . I've been working on this problem for a long time, read great books on the topic, and came up with the following. I am wondering if my approach could result in a very fast algorithm for factoring big numbers. 1. Algorithm As an illustration of how it works, let's apply it to factoring a very modest number, $z=x\cdot y = 1223 \times 2731$ . It involves the following steps. Step 1 . Compute $z_p = z \mbox{ Mod } p$ , for $p=2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13,\cdots, p_z$ . In this case, the upper bound can be as low as $p_z = 127$ (see section 2 about the choice of $p_z$ ). Check values of $p$ generating many identical $z_p$ values. Here, $z_p = 5$ or $z_p = 23$ for instance. Step 2 . We have $z_{59} = z_{85} = z_{111} = 23$ . Thus if $b = 59 \times 85 \times 111$ , because of Theorem A listed below, we have $z_b=23$ . Not sure if this is of any help. Step 3 . Find the set of $(x, y)$ with $x<y$ , with $x, y$ odd, and $x\cdot y \leq z$ satisfying all of the following: $x\cdot y = 23 \mbox{ Mod } 59$ $x\cdot y = 23 \mbox{ Mod } 85$ $x\cdot y = 23 \mbox{ Mod } 111$ You need to create 3 multiplication tables to identify the full list (intersection of 3 infinite lists) of candidates, and ignore those $(x, y)$ that result in $x\cdot y> z$ or $x$ even or $y$ even. Step 4 . The result is $(x, y) \in \{(61,36503),(173,12871),(211,10553),(829, 1327),(1223,2731) \}$ . Step 5 . Among all the 5 above candidates, check if one yields $x\cdot y = z$ . Here $(x=1223, y=2731)$ does and we've factored $z$ . The big question is: how difficult it is to perform step 3? The following elementary theorem could be useful. Could you find a reference for this theorem, or at least prove it? I discovered it myself, but I am sure it must be at least 300 years old. Theorem A Let $p_1, \cdots, p_k$ be $k$ pairwise co-prime positive integers, and $a>0$ an integer. If $z= a \mbox{ Mod } p_i$ for $i=1,\cdots,k$ , then $z= a \mbox{ Mod } (p_1\cdots p_k)$ . Also, let $$q = \arg \max_{p<z} \{z= a \mbox{ Mod } p\}.$$ Then $q+a = z$ . 2. Choice of $p_z$ In practice, in step 1, you can choose the smallest $p_z$ such that $2\cdot 3 \cdot 5\cdot 7 \cdots \cdot p_z > M z$ where $M$ is an absolute constant, maybe as low as $M=30$ . Then you have more than enough choices for step 3. In our example in section 1, we have $z= 3,340,013$ while $59\times 85 \times 111 = 556,665$ . It results in only 5 candidates in step 4. If instead, we consider $x\cdot y = 5 \mbox{ Mod } 21$ $x\cdot y = 5 \mbox{ Mod } 47$ $x\cdot y = 23 \mbox{ Mod } 59$ $x\cdot y = 23 \mbox{ Mod } 85$ $x\cdot y = 23 \mbox{ Mod } 111$ then there would be only 1 candidate in step 4, resulting in factoring $z$ . Note that the product $21 \times 47 \times 59\times 85 \times 111 =549,428,355$ is big enough (much bigger than $z$ itself) and this is what causes the candidate in step 4 to be unique, thus removing the need for step 5. Another example also producing a single candidate (the correct one) is $x\cdot y = 2 \mbox{ Mod } 3$ $x\cdot y = 3 \mbox{ Mod } 5$ $x\cdot y = 5 \mbox{ Mod } 7$ $x\cdot y = 6 \mbox{ Mod } 11$ $x\cdot y = 1 \mbox{ Mod } 13$ $x\cdot y = 6 \mbox{ Mod } 17$ $x\cdot y = 3 \mbox{ Mod } 19$ Again only one candidate in step 4 (thus no step 5) because $3\times 5 \times 7 \cdots \times 19 =  4,849,845$ is big enough, bigger than $z$ . 3. Working with non-primes and conjecture Weirdly enough, this choice works too, resulting in 4 candidates in step 4, including the correct one: $x\cdot y = 1242861 \mbox{ Mod } 2^{21}$ The result is $(x, y) \in \{(3,414287),(97,12813),(291,4271),(1223,2731) \}$ . Remember, $z = 1223 \times 2731$ . This leads to the following conjecture. Conjecture If $z$ is not a prime number, then the following system, with $x \cdot y \leq z$ , uniquely determines two non-trivial numbers $x, y$ such that $x\cdot y = z$ . The system is as follows: $$x\cdot y = m_i \mbox{ Mod } p_i, \mbox{ with } i=1,\cdots, k$$ where $p_1,p_2$ and so on are the prime numbers, $m_i = z \mbox{ Mod } p_i$ , and $k$ is the smallest integer such that $p_1\times \cdots\times p_k > C z$ where $C$ is an absolute constant. I don't know what would be the lower bound for $C$ , maybe $C=10$ works. The congruence system is linked to the Chinese Remainder Theorem. See page 88 in the book Prime Numbers - A Computational Perspective (2nd Edition), by R Grandall and C Pomerance (Springer, 2010). A careful choice of the moduli (rather than $p_1, \cdots, p_k$ ) could lead to a faster algorithm.","Update on 5/27/2020: I summarized all discussions related to this post, added a bit more about computational complexity, and published it on my blog, here .

In our example in section 1, we have while . It results in only 5 candidates in step 4. If instead, we consider then there would be only 1 candidate in step 4, resulting in factoring . Note that the product is big enough (much bigger than itself) and this is what causes the candidate in step 4 to be unique, thus removing the need for step 5. Another example also producing a single candidate (the correct one) is Again only one candidate in step 4 (thus no step 5) because is big enough, bigger than . 3. Working with non-primes and conjecture Weirdly enough, this choice works too, resulting in 4 candidates in step 4, including the correct one: The result is . Remember, . This leads to the following conjecture. Conjecture If is not a prime number, then the following system, with , uniquely determines two non-trivial numbers such that . The system is as follows: where and so on are the prime numbers, , and is the smallest integer such that where is an absolute constant. I don't know what would be the lower bound for , maybe works. The congruence system is linked to the Chinese Remainder Theorem. See page 88 in the book Prime Numbers - A Computational Perspective (2nd Edition), by R Grandall and C Pomerance (Springer, 2010).

48,Mental Primality Testing,Mental Primality Testing,,"At a trivia night, the following question was posed: ""What is the smallest 5 digit prime?"" Teams (of 4) were given about a minute to write down their answer to the question. Obviously, the answer is googleable, so I'm not asking what the answer to the trivia question is, but rather: how could a team quickly find the answer without previous knowledge of it? If you wanted to try solving the trivia question yourself, don't read any further, as I will start discussing the answer and ruling out other numbers now. My thoughts so far: If you know your slide rules, you expect that prime density is close to $ln(10,000)$ or about 10%. So, a reasonable approach would be to focus on numbers 10,000 through 10,010. Really, what matters is that (I assume) you start at 10,000, factor as many numbers in a row as you can, and then guest the first number you haven't factored. We can rule out a lot with easy divisibility tests, leaving 10001, 10003, 10007, and 10009. Assuming one of your people is fast with division or knows better divisibility rules, 10003 is also eliminated because it has a small divisor (7). This shouldn't require a special technique. We're now left with 3 numbers that reasonable divisibility tests won't handle. It turns out 10,001 is composite, while 10,007 and 10,009 are both prime. But the smaller factor of 10,001 is 73, which is the 21st prime. If the team could do the above steps and then rule out 10,001 by dividing by the first 21 primes (also assuming they know the first 21 primes), they would presumably guess 10,007 thereby being right (though not necessarily confident in their answer). But, let's assume that 21 divisions aren't quite possible. Is there a faster way? Let's say that either a test that quickly determines that 10,001 is likely composite or a test that determines that 10,007 is likely prime is sufficient, since we might be down to some guess work at this point, but bonus points if we can know for sure 10,001 is composite or know for sure 10,007 is prime, and extra bonus points if we do both! There are potentially approaches that don't rely on ruling out 10,001. For example, I had the idea initially that given that 10,001, 10,007, and 10,009 are each hard to divide, maybe it's fairly likely that 10,007 and 10,009 are twin primes, and therefore it is more likely that 10,007 is a prime than 10,001 and so you would guess it anyway. While 10,007 and 10,009 do turn out to be twin primes, I don't actually think that the assertion holds, and this seems more like luck.","At a trivia night, the following question was posed: ""What is the smallest 5 digit prime?""

54,Arithmetic progressions of sums of two squares,Arithmetic progressions of sums of two squares,,"Let $E=\square+\square$ denote the set of integers of the form $a^2+b^2$ . It is well-known that $n\in E$ iff for any prime $p\equiv 3\pmod{4}$ we have that $\nu_p(n)$ is even, so it is not difficult to prove that the density of $E$ is zero, or even more precise bounds like $$\left| E\cap [1,n]\right| \sim \frac{cn}{\sqrt{\log n}}. $$ On the other hand we know many subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ with density zero but containing arithmetic progressions of arbitrary length: for instance the set of primes, as shown by Green and Tao. I was wondering if $E$ also contains APs with arbitrary length. It is fairly trivial to prove the existence of infinite APs in $E$ with four terms, namely $$(n-8)^2+(n-1)^2,\quad (n-7)^2+(n+4)^2,\quad (n+7)^2+(n-4)^2,\quad (n+8)^2+(n+1)^2 $$ but I was not able to find longer parametric APs or a reply to my question in the literature. Any help is appreciated. Addendum : the answer should be affirmative, for instance by applying Gowers-type attacks to the discrete Fourier transform of the indicator function of $E\cap[1,n]$ , or just by considering that any long AP of primes $\equiv 1\pmod{4}$ is also a long AP in $E$ . For instance $214861583621 + 37692995340n$ for $n\in[0,9]$ gives an AP with length $10$ . UPDATE : I have found parametric $5$ -APs and proved the existence of infinite $6$ -APs. The idea was just to identify some $n$ s such that $(n+8)^2+(n+1)^2+12n = 2n^2+30n+65$ belongs to $E$ . Luckily $E$ is a semigroup, hence it is enough to impose that $4n^2+60n+130=(2n+15)^2-95\in E$ , or to prove that for infinite values of $m$ we have that $5m^2-19$ belongs to $E$ . If we brutally compute the density of $m\in[1,N]$ such that $5m^2-19\in E$ we have that this density drops to zero, albeit very slowly (as expected). On the other hand we may try to find parametric solutions to $$ 5m^2-A^2-B^2 = 19 $$ given by quadratic forms. We have $5=2^2+1^2$ and $5\cdot 2^2-1^2=19$ , hence a reasonable choice is $$ m = M^2+aM+2,\quad A=2M^2+bM,\quad B=M^2+cM+1. $$ By picking $b$ as $2a+2$ and $c$ as $a-4$ we have $$ \frac{5m^2-A^2-B^2-19}{M} = 8+18a-2M $$ hence $M=9a+4$ gives that for any $m=(9a+4)^2+a(9a+4)+2=90a^2+76a+18$ we have $5m^2-19\in E$ . This implies the existence of infinite $5$ -APs in $E$ , for instance the previous $4$ -APs with $n=100a^2-65a+10$ (these are induced by $5=2^2+1^2$ and $19=5\cdot 3^2-5^2-1^2$ ): $(100a^2-65a+2)^2+(100a^2-65a+9)^2$ $(100a^2-65a+3)^2+(100a^2-65a+14)^2$ $(100a^2-65a+17)^2+(100a^2-65a+6)^2$ $(100a^2-65a+18)^2+(100a^2-65a+11)^2$ $(100a^2-85a+22)^2+(100a^2-45a+9)^2$ These numbers are all $\equiv 0\pmod{5}$ : they lead to a $5$ -AP whose first term is $(60a^2-39a+4)^2+(20a^2-13a-1)^2$ and with common difference $12(20a^2-13a+2)$ . We may impose that $$(60a^2-39a+4)^2+(20a^2-13a-1)^2+60(20a^2-13a+2)\\=(20a^2-25a+37-3v)^2+(60a^2-35a+v)^2,$$ leading to a $6$ -AP, by finding integer points on $$ 616-392a-111v+40av+5v^2 = 0.$$ Actually it is enough to find some rational point, since we may scale the elements of an AP by an arbitrary square. We have the rational point $(a,v)=(0,11)$ , hence we have infinite rational points by Vieta jumping and infinite $6$ -APs in $E$ . This also gives substance to the dream of an elementary proof. In the last lines we proved that a parametric $4$ -AP (with parameter $n$ ) can always be extended to a parametric $5$ -AP if $n$ is taken among the values of a quadratic polynomial $q(a)$ . At this point it looks reasonable that by taking $a$ among the values of a quadratic polynomial $q_2(b)$ we can write down parametric $6$ -APs and so on. If this actually works, the first $k$ -AP has to appear before $2^{c\cdot 2^k}$ . SECOND UPDATE We may also form APs in $E$ by looking at rational points $P_k=(x_k,y_k)\in S^1$ such that $x_k+y_k$ form an AP. The range of $x_k+y_k$ over the rational points of $S^1$ is exactly given by the values of $\pm \frac{m^2-2m-1}{m^2+1}$ for $m\in\mathbb{Q}^+$ by Vieta jumping. It is possible to list the elements of $\mathbb{Q}^+$ as in the Stern-Brocot tree and check for APs in the range of $f:x\mapsto \pm\frac{x^2-2x-1}{x^2+1}$ . The triple $\frac{23}{65},\frac{35}{65},\frac{47}{65}$ is easily found by hand, and leads to the fact that $$(65n-33)^2+(65n+56)^2,\quad (65n-25)^2+(65n+60)^2,\quad (65n-16)^2+(65n+63)^2$$ is a $3$ -AP in $E$ (with common difference $1560n$ ) for any $n\geq 1$ . And it looks extremely reasonable that the range of $f$ contains arbitrarily long APs, since $r_2(n)$ is unbounded. Another interesting fact is that the ""linear"" $4$ -AP shown at the beginning can be extended to a $6$ -AP if $n$ is chosen in such a way that both $2n^2\pm 30n+65$ belong to $E$ . If $2n^2+30n+65\in E$ for any $n$ in the range of an odd cubic polynomial, $n=c(m)$ , then $$ 2c(m)^2+30 c(m)+65 = d(m)^2+e(m)^2 $$ automatically implies $2n^2-30n+65\in E$ via $2c(m)^2-30c(m)+65=d(-m)^2+e(-m)^2$ .

My question: Can we extend this to the integers of other imaginary quadratic fields? How many integer solutions are there to $x^2+2y^2 = n$ and $x^2+3y^2 = n$? Can this be generalized? To derive the result for $x^2+y^2=n$, one extends the notion of a Euler product to the Gaussian integers $\mathbf{Z}[i]$. Suppose $a_n$ is the number of solutions, so $a_n$ is the number of ideals $(\alpha)\in\mathbf{Z}[i]$ such that $N(\alpha)=n$. Using well known characterization of irreducibles in $\mathbf{Z}[i]$, we get $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{a_n}{n^s}=\prod_{(\pi)}\frac{1}{1-N(\pi)^{-s}}=\left(\frac{1}{1-2^{-s}}\right)\prod_{p\equiv 1\pmod{4}}\left(\frac{1}{1-p^{-s}}\right)^2\prod_{q\equiv 3\pmod{4}}\left(\frac{1}{1-q^{-2s}}\right). $$ After algebraic manipulation followed by introducing the zeta function, we can write the RHS as $$ \zeta(s)\left(\prod_{p\equiv 1\pmod{4}}\frac{1}{1-p^{-s}}\right)\left(\prod_{q\equiv 3\pmod{4}}\frac{1}{1+q^{-s}}\right)=\zeta(s)\prod_{p}\frac{1}{1-\chi(p)p^{-s}}=\zeta(s)\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\chi(n)}{n^s}$$ due to standard results on multiplicativity. Finally, due to Dirichlet convolution, we can match up coefficients to what we originally started with to get the desired $a_n = \sum_{d|n}\chi(d)$. In the case of $x^2+3y^2=n$, we would work over $\mathbf{Z}[\omega]$. The irreducibles here are precisely $1-\omega$, $q\equiv 2\pmod{3}$ where $q$ is a rational prime, and $\pi$ such that $p = \pi\bar\pi$ where $p\equiv 1\pmod{3}$ is a rational prime. Similarly in $\mathbf{Z}[\sqrt{-2}]$, the conditions for irreducibility depend on the residue class of the norm modulo $8$. Thus, using a Dirichlet character modulo $3$ or modulo $8$, could we also extend the Euler product to these rings - thus allowing to answer such questions? Finally, can this be generalized to the integers of $\mathbf{Q}(\sqrt{-d})$ in general so as to give a way to count the number of solutions to $x^2+dy^2=n$ in terms of Dirichlet characters? Would this work differently in quadratic extensions with different class numbers? Moreover, there are $\varphi(m)$ characters modulo $m$, so which one would we use?

74,How to check whether an ideal is a prime (or maximal) ideal?,How to check whether an ideal is a prime (or maximal) ideal?,,"I have a ring $R$ which is known to be a Dedekind domain, but not necessarily a  Euclidian domain, and a nonzero ideal generated by one or two elements in this ring. How can I check if this ideal is a prime ideal? For ideals generated by one element, this is equivalent to being a prime element in the ring. I programmed a clone of the Erathosthenes sieve for my ring, but this only shows me which elements are irreducible, which does not necessarily imply primality. To be more concrete, my ring $R$ is the ring of integers in an imaginary quadratic number field $\mathbb{Q}(d)$ (for $d$ a negative squarefree integer). These rings are of the form $R = \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-d}]$ or $R = \mathbb{Z}[\frac{1+\sqrt{-d}}{2}]$, depending on $d$. These are Dedekind domains, and every ideal there is generated by either one or two elements. For some $d$ (like $-1$, $-2$, $-3$), these are Euclidean domains, where I can use the division with remainder to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers, meaning that each ideal is generated by one element. For others (like $d = -7$), there is no division with remainder, and we can't use the Euclidean algorithm. But even here it is not yet clear for me: how do I distinguish irreducible from prime elements? The most famous example: for $d = -5$ we have $R = \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$, and the element $2$ is not prime here, since $2 \cdot 3 = 6 = (1+\sqrt{-5})\cdot(1-\sqrt{-5})$ and 2 is not a factor of either term on the right side. By testing multiples, I can find numbers with different decompositions, and then know that those factors can't be prime. But when can I stop searching, if I don't find any? In this particular ring, the first elements not yet shown as either units, irreducible-not-prime or composite (after checking all elements until about $\pm 50 \pm 50i$) are $\pm \sqrt{-5}$, $\pm 4 \pm 2\sqrt{-5}$, $\pm 6 \pm \sqrt{-5}$. Could I be sure here that there really are prime? Another example, $d = -7$, $R = \mathbb{Z}[\frac{1+\sqrt{-7}}{2}] = \mathbb{Z}[X]/(X^2+X+2)$: Here I find lots of irreducible-non-prime elements, and the only small ""irreducible and not yet shown as non-prime"" are $\pm \frac{1-\sqrt{-7}}{2}$. (The principal ideal generated by these elements look quite same as the one created by $\frac{1+\sqrt{-7}}{2}$, though - I think there is simply a glitch in my program.) This ring is non-Euclidean, and I suppose most (if not all but the zero ideal) prime ideals are generated by two elements here. If I have a candidate pair of elements, how do I find out if it is really a nonzero prime (= maximal) ideal? Any ideas here would helpful, since I'm a bit stuck here. (Most literature about computational ideal theory I found only works in polynomial rings over fields (and makes heavy use of this fact), thus it does not really help here.) (I'm writing a program which should then be able to work on any of these rings $R$ (and any ideals there), thus facts that are only valid in a small number of those rings are less helpful.

76,Thoughts on the Collatz conjecture; integers added to powers of 2,Thoughts on the Collatz conjecture; integers added to powers of 2,,"I've had a thought about the Collatz conjecture (the 3n+1 problem). Suppose some number, C, diverges under the iteration. We first note that C must be odd because if C were even it would be halved immediately, and so $\frac {C}{2}$ would be the lowest. Take some arbitrary power of 2, $2^a, a>1$, and let us perform the iteration on $2^a +1$ $2^a+1$ is odd, so we go to $3*2^{a}+4$, then to $3*2^{a-1}+2$ and to $3*2^{a-2}+1$ Since we observe that $3*2^{a-2}+1 < 2^{a}+1$, C cannot be of the form $2^a+1$. Now suppose we have some number n which definitely goes to 1. We now perform the Collatz iteration on $2^{a}+n$. The parity of this number is identical to the parity of n. If we were to perform 3n+1, then we would have $3*2^{a}+3n+1$ Indeed, since the parity of the number is determined by n, the iteration (i.e. whether we triple and add one or halve) is identical to that of n. If we say there are $\alpha$ '3n+1's and $\beta$ '$\frac{n}{2}$'s, this gives us the expression $\frac{3^{\alpha}}{2^{\beta}}*2^{a}+1 < 2^{a}+1 < 2^{a}+n$ (provided $\frac{3^{\alpha}}{2^{\beta}}<1$) We know this is the same iteration which n must undergo, and we know that when n is iterated, we will arrive at the following: $\frac{3^{\alpha}}{2^{\beta}}n+k=1 > \frac{3^{\alpha}}{2^{\beta}}n$ Where k is some positive constant dependent on the order of the iterations. This implies that $\frac{3^{\alpha}}{2^{\beta}}<1$. So, as we had with the case n=1, provided that n goes to 1, $2^{a} +n$ goes to 1. Now suppose we had verified the case of the collatz conjecture for some small numbers; say 1 and 3. Not only is it true for n=1 & 3, but it is also true for 5,7,9,11,17,19, etc. And since it is true for 1,3,5,7... it must be true for 9,11,13 and 15, from which we can say it is true for 17,19,21 and so on for all odd whole numbers. And therefore our number C at the start is neither odd nor even, and so there is no smallest number which diverges to infinity. In fact, if we say that C could be the smallest element in a cycle then we would also have a contradiction. Is this legit? I've probably made an error somewhere, but I figured it was worth putting it on here since it might get some attention. Thank you for your time. UPDATE: It has been pointed out that there is a flaw in the argument. Specifically, that we have assumed that a, the power on 2, Is larger than $\beta$ when, in general, it is not. The consequence of this is that certain numbers, specifically those of the form $2^{a}-n$ where a is any integer greater than 1 and n is either 1, 5 or 17. For example, if we take $2^{4}-5=11$, we have: $2^{4}-5 \rightarrow 3*2^{4}-14 \rightarrow 3*2^{3}-7 \rightarrow 3^{2} * 2^{3}-20 \rightarrow 3^{2} * 2^{2}-10 \rightarrow 3^{2} * 2^{1}-5 \rightarrow 3^{3} * 2^{1}-14 \rightarrow 3^{3}-7 $ Apologies for the rather messy notation but it helps us to see what is going on. First of all, we see that 4 has been reduced to nothing without us learning very much about the number (certainly not whether it decreases). We also note that in the 1st and 6th terms 5 appears on the end - this is because when we extend the iteration into negative integers, there are more cycles than 1-2-4 , and their smallest elements are precisely -1, -5 and -17.","I've had a thought about the Collatz conjecture (the 3n+1 problem).

This is the least prime $r$ for which I don't know whether $p^2 - 2 q^2 = r$ has a solution in primes. The solutions of the Pell-type equation $x^2 - 2 y^2 = 5039$ are $x_n, y_n$ given by the recurrences $x_{n+4} = 6 x_{n+2} - x_n$ with initial values $x_0 = 71, x_1 = 209, x_2 = 217, x_3 = 1183$ and $y_{n+4} = 6 y_{n+2} - y_n$ with initial values $y_{{0}}=1,y_{{1}}=139,y_{{2}}=145,y_{{3}}=835$ .

Harder Problem(s): If the above is trivial, then suppose $a, b, c$ and $t$ are real and compute the following sums $$ \sum_{i = 0}^{\lfloor a t \rfloor} \left \lbrace b \left( t - \frac{i}{a} \right) \right \rbrace \qquad \text{and} \qquad \sum_{i = 0}^{\lfloor a t \rfloor} \sum_{j = 0}^{\lfloor b(t-i/a) \rfloor} \left \lbrace c \left( t - \frac{i}{a} - \frac{j}{b} \right) \right \rbrace $$ as well as $$ \sum_{i = 1}^{\lfloor a t \rfloor} \left \lbrace b \left( t - \frac{i}{a} \right) \right \rbrace \qquad \text{and} \qquad \sum_{i = 1}^{\lfloor a t \rfloor} \sum_{j = 1}^{\lfloor b(t-i/a) \rfloor} \left \lbrace c \left( t - \frac{i}{a} - \frac{j}{b} \right) \right \rbrace. $$",,"['number-theory', 'reference-request']"

94,A club for some special prime numbers: new members welcome,A club for some special prime numbers: new members welcome,,"Given an integer $i$, find an integer $n$ ( $2^{j-1}\le n <2^j$), and a prime divisor $p$ of $M_n=2^n-1$, so that $v= j+i$; where $p$ is written as $k2^v+1$, $k$ odd. In other words, $j$ is such that $2^{j-1}\le ord_p(2) <2^j$ where $ord_p(2)$ is the multiplicative order of $2$ in $Z/pZ^*$. Any odd number $p$ can be assigned such an $i$ value, but, when $p$ is prime, most of the times $v$ is smaller than $j$ and $i$ is negative. Most of the times $i$ is close to $-Log_2(p)+1$. When only $i\ge 0$ are allowed, these primes $p$ become quite rare, and all the more that $i$ is large. I wonder whether some real mathematician ever investigated this. $65537 = 1.2^{16}+1$ is a divisor of $2^{2^5}-1$: here $v=16; j=6$ and $i=10$. This used to be the largest $i$ that I know. $59393=29.2^{11}+1$ is a divisor of $2^{29.2^3}-1$: here $v=11; j=8$ and $i=3$. $115201=225.2^9+1$ is a divisor of $2^{225}-1$: here $v=9; j=8$ and $i=1$. For a Mersenne prime, $v=1$, (or $i=1-j$, it is always negative). For a Fermat prime $p=2^{2^l}+1$, $v=2^l$, $j=l+2$, and $i=2^l-l-2$ can grow very big. Conversely, if one could prove that, for primes, $i$ as defined above is limited, wouldn't one also prove in the same time, as a corollary, that there are only finitely many Fermat primes? I checked all primes below $4278255361$ and found only about $60$ primes (out of more than $200000000$) with $i\ge0$.  This club is made more ""select"" if you let only the larger $i$ in: only about $30$ have $i\gt0$. $51453953(i=0); 126074881(i=1); 115201(i=1)$ which are divisors of Mersenne number $M_n$ where $n$ is odd, were introduced to me here by Peter KoÅ¡inÃ¡r. Other guys that you know are welcome in the club, if they qualify (larger than $4278255361$ and not already in the list for larger numbers hereafter). V.I.P. lounge access for $i>0$ only. It seems that apart from Fermat primes themselves, prime divisors of Fermat numbers (like $2424833 (i=5)$) may provide some of the largest $i$ values. It can be demonstrated that prime divisors of Fermat numbers all have $i\ge0$. ... On the other hand, it seems  that prime divisors of Mersenne numbers of prime index can very hardly have $i\ge0$... But some very large $i$ are also obtained for primes which are not divisors of Fermat numbers. For now, the top 13 is as follows: NÂ°13: $2424833 (i=5)$ NÂ°12: $536903681 (i=8)$ NÂ°11: $65537 (i=10)$ NÂ°10: $140737471578113 (i=16)$ NÂ°9: $18446744069414584321 (i=24)$ Its $i$ almost matches that of $F_5=2^{2^5}+1 (i=25)$. $F_5$ would be in the top 10... if it was prime. This make me think of $18446744069414584321$ as a sort of 'failed' Fermat prime, though it is not even a divisor of a Fermat prime. Actually it is $(2^{3.2^5}+1)/F_5$.

It seems that $Q_{p,j}=(2^{p.2^j}+1)/F_j$ has $i=2^j-j-2-Floor(Log_2(p))$. Therefore, just after Fermat primes, primes with large $i$ are to be looked for amongst $Q_{p,j}$, with $p$ as small as possible, whenever they are prime. The question is whether prime $Q_{p,j}$s are less rarities than prime $F_j$s... This might be so, since they have two indexes. Also NÂ°12, NÂ°10 and the top 8 can be written as $p=2^q\pm2^{(q+1)/2}+1$ which is a divisor of $2^{4q}-1$, thanks to the Aurifeuillean factorization, therefore $ord_p(2)=4q$, $v=(q+1)/2$ and hence leads to $i=(q+1)/2 -3 -Floor(Log_2(q))$. This can be used to look for large $i$s, when $p=2^q\pm2^{(q+1)/2}+1$ is prime for a large $q$. Primes like this seem much more easy to find than prime $Q_{p,j}$. Can someone find new primes for the top ten, which are not of the $2^q\pm2^{(q+1)/2}+1$ kind ? Any non-Proth prime in the club?  yes! $262657=513.2^9+1$. This is probably not the only one..

I wonder whether some real mathematician ever investigated this. $65537 = 1.2^{16}+1$ is a divisor of $2^{2^5}-1$: here $v=16; j=6$ and $i=10$. This used to be the largest $i$ that I know. $59393=29.2^{11}+1$ is a divisor of $2^{29.2^3}-1$: here $v=11; j=8$ and $i=3$. $115201=225.2^9+1$ is a divisor of $2^{225}-1$: here $v=9; j=8$ and $i=1$. For a Mersenne prime, $v=1$, (or $i=1-j$, it is always negative). For a Fermat prime $p=2^{2^l}+1$, $v=2^l$, $j=l+2$, and $i=2^l-l-2$ can grow very big. Conversely, if one could prove that, for primes, $i$ as defined above is limited, wouldn't one also prove in the same time, as a corollary, that there are only finitely many Fermat primes? I checked all primes below $4278255361$ and found only about $60$ primes (out of more than $200000000$) with $i\ge0$.  This club is made more ""select"" if you let only the larger $i$ in: only about $30$ have $i\gt0$. $51453953(i=0); 126074881(i=1); 115201(i=1)$ which are divisors of Mersenne number $M_n$ where $n$ is odd, were introduced to me here by Peter KoÅ¡inÃ¡r. Other guys that you know are welcome in the club, if they qualify (larger than $4278255361$ and not already in the list for larger numbers hereafter). V.I.P. lounge access for $i>0$ only. It seems that apart from Fermat primes themselves, prime divisors of Fermat numbers (like $2424833 (i=5)$) may provide some of the largest $i$ values. It can be demonstrated that prime divisors of Fermat numbers all have $i\ge0$. ... On the other hand, it seems  that prime divisors of Mersenne numbers of prime index can very hardly have $i\ge0$... But some very large $i$ are also obtained for primes which are not divisors of Fermat numbers. For now, the top 13 is as follows: NÂ°13: $2424833 (i=5)$ NÂ°12: $536903681 (i=8)$ NÂ°11: $65537 (i=10)$ NÂ°10: $140737471578113 (i=16)$ NÂ°9: $18446744069414584321 (i=24)$ Its $i$ almost matches that of $F_5=2^{2^5}+1 (i=25)$. $F_5$ would be in the top 10... if it was prime. This make me think of $18446744069414584321$ as a sort of 'failed' Fermat prime, though it is not even a divisor of a Fermat prime. Actually it is $(2^{3.2^5}+1)/F_5$. NÂ°8: $9444732965601851473921 (i=28)$ NÂ°7: $604462909806215075725313 (i=31)$ NÂ°6: $10384593717069655112945804582584321 (i=48)$ NÂ°5: $2854495385411919762116496381035264358442074113 (i=66)$ NÂ°4: $182687704666362864775461208552445184771578920961 (i=69)$ NÂ°3: $11692013098647223345629483497433542615764159168513 (i=72)$ NÂ°2: $187072209578355573530071639244871112681892570202113 (i=74)$ NÂ°1: $883423532389192164791648750371459256584513952652893606156996040365965313      (i=110)$ Congratulations! It seems that $Q_{p,j}=(2^{p.2^j}+1)/F_j$ has $i=2^j-j-2-Floor(Log_2(p))$. Therefore, just after Fermat primes, primes with large $i$ are to be looked for amongst $Q_{p,j}$, with $p$ as small as possible, whenever they are prime. The question is whether prime $Q_{p,j}$s are less rarities than prime $F_j$s... This might be so, since they have two indexes. Also NÂ°12, NÂ°10 and the top 8 can be written as $p=2^q\pm2^{(q+1)/2}+1$ which is a divisor of $2^{4q}-1$, thanks to the Aurifeuillean factorization, therefore $ord_p(2)=4q$, $v=(q+1)/2$ and hence leads to $i=(q+1)/2 -3 -Floor(Log_2(q))$. This can be used to look for large $i$s, when $p=2^q\pm2^{(q+1)/2}+1$ is prime for a large $q$. Primes like this seem much more easy to find than prime $Q_{p,j}$. Can someone find new primes for the top ten, which are not of the $2^q\pm2^{(q+1)/2}+1$ kind ? Any non-Proth prime in the club?  yes! $262657=513.2^9+1$. This is probably not the only one..  Any Cullen prime in the club? $141.2^{141} + 1$ has $i=-4$ though. prime p / i 6487031809 / 2 70525124609 / 0 190274191361 / 0 646730219521 / 0 2710954639361 / 1 2748779069441 / 1 4432676798593 / 1 4485296422913 / 0 6597069766657 / 1 25409026523137 / 0 25991531462657 / 2 31065037602817 / 0 46179488366593 / 0 67280421310721 / 0 76861124116481 / 1 140737471578113 / 16 151413703311361 / 1 192971705688577 / 1 640126220763137 / 0 1095981164658689 / 1 1238926361552897 / 1 18446744069414584321 / 24 9444732965601851473921 / 28 604462909806215075725313 / 31 10384593717069655112945804582584321 / 48 2854495385411919762116496381035264358442074113 / 66 182687704666362864775461208552445184771578920961 / 69 11692013098647223345629483497433542615764159168513 / 72 187072209578355573530071639244871112681892570202113 / 74 883423532389192164791648750371459256584513952652893606156996040365965313 / 110",,"['number-theory', 'elementary-number-theory', 'prime-numbers', 'modular-arithmetic']"

If we find all of these numbers, then we should prove the case only for the numbers which are not in this form.
