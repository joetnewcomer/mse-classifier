2,Does local Hölder-continuity suffice to get an upper bound for Hausdorff dimension - or does it need to be global? ((Mistake in the literature?)),Does local Hölder-continuity suffice to get an upper bound for Hausdorff dimension - or does it need to be global? ((Mistake in the literature?)),,"It is a well-known fact that Brownian Motion is almost surely locally $\alpha$ -Hölder continuous for $\alpha\in(0,1/2)$ . This is sometimes used in conjunction with the following result concerning Hausdorff dimension -- when proving McKean's Theorem, for instance (that is, Proposition 2 strengthened to equality). Proposition 1. Let $(M,d_1)$ and $(N,d_2)$ be two metric spaces, and $f:M\to N$ a ( globally ) $\gamma$ -Hölder continuous function with $\gamma$ -Hölder constant $L$ . Then we have, for all $\alpha\geq0$ , and for all subsets $A$ of $M$ , that \begin{equation*}     \mathcal{H}^{\infty}_{\alpha/\gamma}(f(A))\leq L^{\alpha/\gamma}\cdot\mathcal{H}^{\infty}_{\alpha}(A) \end{equation*} In particular, we have that $\dim f(A)\leq\frac{1}{\gamma}\dim A$ . $\Diamond$ Here, we denote by $\mathcal{H}^{\infty}_{\alpha}(A)$ the unlimited $\alpha$ -Hausdorff content of $A$ . One then uses Proposition 1, in some way, to show that Proposition 2. Let $\{B(t):t\geq0\}$ be $d$ -dimensional Brownian motion, and fix a subset $A$ of $[0,\infty)$ .

This is, for example, done in Brownian Motion (2010) by Peter Mörters and Yuval Peres, with Remark 4.15 on page 102 ( here is a publicly available pdf, provided by the University of Bath). It seems that the three Bachelor's thesis/essays here , here and here have relied upon that remark without further justification. On the other hand, the books treating Hausdorff measure by Falconer (2003) and Mattila (1995) only state results for globally Hölder continuous functions, and make no mention of strengthened versions for local Hölder continuity.

Then since $f$ is locally $\gamma$ -Hölder continuous everywhere, there exist, for each point $x$ in $X$ , two constants $\delta_{x}>0$ and $L_{x}\geq0$ so that for all $y\in M$ with $d_1(x,y)<\delta_x$ , we have $d_2(f(x),f(y))\leq L_x\cdot\left(d_1(x,y)\right)^{\gamma}$ . As $X$ is dense in $M$ , we have \begin{equation*}     f(A)=\bigcup_{x\in X}f(B(x,\delta_x)) \end{equation*} and so, by countable stability of $\mathcal{H}^{\infty}_{\alpha}$ and by Proposition 1, it is sufficient to show that $f\vert_{B(x,\delta_x)}$ is $\gamma$ -Hölder continuous for all $x\in X$ . Indeed, fix $x\in X$ and let $y,z$ be two points in $B(x,\delta_x)$ .

3,"Why must a discrete atomic measure admit a decomposition into Dirac measures? Moreover, what is ""an atomic class""?","Why must a discrete atomic measure admit a decomposition into Dirac measures? Moreover, what is ""an atomic class""?",,"$\newcommand{\A}{\mathcal{A}}$ EDIT: Half of this question may be answered by this post, which remarks that the definitions of atomic space indeed are contradictory in general, so my suspicion that Wikipedia was being lazy was correct. I still would like clarification on the discrete measure and atomic class definitions. OP: All of this is a series of quibbles with the very briefly written Wikipedia article on measure-theoretic atoms . Let $(X,\Sigma,\mu)$ be a measure space. An atom is a set $\A\in\Sigma$ for which $0\lt\mu(\A)$ and for every measurable $B\subseteq\A$ , either $\mu(B)=0$ or $\mu(B)=\mu(\A)$ . The space is defined to be atomic, or purely atomic, if every measurable set of strictly positive measure contains an atom. Suppose $X$ is $\sigma$ -finite. Then if $X$ is atomic, there are disjoint atoms $\{\A_n:n\in\Bbb N\}$ such that $X=\bigsqcup_{n\in\Bbb N}\A_n$ . So, $\sigma$ -finitude implies there are disjoint measurable $\{E_n:n\in\Bbb N\}$ with $X=\bigsqcup_{n\in\Bbb N}E_n$ , $\mu(E_n)\lt\infty$ for all $n$ . The fact that $X$ is atomic implies every single one of the $E_n$ is either null or containing an atom. I note that if any of the $E_n$ are null, this makes the proof really very difficult since no null set can contain an atom. I am not even sure if the statement remains true in this case! Assuming all the $E_n$ are $\mu$ -positive, they then all contain atoms $\A_n$ . I cannot see where the argument might lead from here. It is completely possible that $E_n\setminus\A_n\neq\emptyset$ for some $n$ , and then in order for the result to hold we need to find a partition of $E_n\setminus\A_n$ into countably many disjoint atoms. However, it is again still possible that $\mu(E_n\setminus A_n)=0$ for the same $n$ , at which point we have a problem - there is no set of atoms with $E_n$ as their union. I am dubious that the general result is true at all... how do we show this? I am beginning to think this is more a definition rather than a proof, but Wikipedia claims the two are formally equivalent statements. The reverse direction is not even true, since it possible for an atom to have infinite measure (at least, Wikipedia did not define any otherwise). Now about discrete measures: If $\A$ is an atom, all the subsets in the $\mu$ -equivalence class of $[\A]$ of $\A$ are atoms, and $[\A]$ is called an atomic class. I think Wikipedia means by this: the atomic class of $\A$ is the set of all atoms with the same measure as $\A$ . However, they seem to think that the $\mu$ -equivalence class - my only guess is that this means $E\sim F\iff\mu(E)=\mu(F)$ - of $\A$ will contain only atoms, but this is ridiculous so I think "" $\mu$ -equivalence"" is referring to something else. Perhaps they mean the Nikodym metric: $A\sim B\iff\mu(A\Delta B)=0$ where $\Delta$ is symmetric difference. So, there is a confusion on the definition of atomic class. Leaving that aside for now, they say that a discrete space is a $\sigma$ -finite measure space in which all atomic classes have nonempty self-intersection: $$\forall[\A],\,\bigcap_{A\in[\A]}A\neq\emptyset$$ But then they claim that this is equivalent to "" $\mu$ is the countable weighted sum of Dirac measures"", i.e.: $$\mu=\sum_{n=1}^\infty c_n\cdot\delta_{x_n}$$ Where $x_n$ is some point in the intersection of each atomic class (there are countably many since they assert that in a $\sigma$ -finite space there can only be countably many atomic classes - I am unsure of this because I am unsure of the definition of atomic class). However, to me this automatically implies that the singletons $\{x_n\}$ are all atoms since $\mu(x_n)=c_n$ by definition of $\delta$ . This does not follow (in any way that I can see) from the intersection definition of atomic class, so I am suspicious. The reverse implication that discrete spaces are atomic is also not obvious to me, since if we suppose $\mu:=\sum_{n=1}^\infty c_n\delta_{x_n}$ there is no clear way to generate a partition of atoms $\A_n$ which make up $X$ from this. Summary: Is $\sigma$ -finite and ""every set of strictly positive measure contains an atom"" really equivalent to ""there is a disjoint partition of $X$ into atoms""? Answer: no, not in general. Even if one assumes $\sigma$ -finitude of the space, the result can only be proved if one allows for the partition to have up to a null set, or if one includes null sets as atoms (but this is silly to me, since there would no longer be any atomless measures) - see the linked post. I have edited the section of that article accordingly. What does Wikipedia really mean when they define atomic class? How is discrete - as defined by nonempty intersections of atomic classes - equivalent to the measure being a sum of Dirac measures? I am aware that the asking of multiple questions is discouraged but these are individually all fairly brief to answer and they are so related that it would feel strange to ask them separately.","EDIT: Half of this question may be answered by this post, which remarks that the definitions of atomic space indeed are contradictory in general, so my suspicion that Wikipedia was being lazy was correct.

In lemma 4.30 of Folland's ""A Course in Abstract Harmonic Analysis"" (Second Edition) one needs to show the square-integrability of the function $f$ defined below and I don't understand how Folland deduces it from the inequality below. For context, $G$ is a locally compact abelian Hausdorff group and $dx$ is the Haar measure on $G$ (note that Folland defines Radon measures to be outer regular and inner regular on open sets). Furthermore $f$ is continuous, bounded and a linear combination of functions of positive type (this is encoded in the notation $f \in \mathcal{B}(G)$ ). Here is what i have tried so far: With Plancherel's theorem we see (as in Folland's proof) that $$(L^1(G) \cap L^2(G), \|\cdot\|_2) \to \mathbb{C}, \ k \mapsto \int_G f(x) \cdot k(x) \, dx$$ defines a bounded linear functional which extends to a bounded linear functional $F \in L^2(G)^*$ by the BLT theorem (I removed the complex conjugation for linearity; this should not make a difference in the argumentation). Now Riesz's theorem yields an $r \in \mathcal{L}^2(G)$ such that $F$ is given by integration against $r$ , i.e. $$F(k) = \int_G r(x) \cdot k(x) \, dx \ \text{ for all } k \in L^2(G).$$ In particular we have $$\int_G f(x) \cdot k(x) \, dx = \int_G r(x) \cdot k(x) \, dx \ \text{ for all } k \in L^1(G) \cap L^2(G).$$ With this we can show that the set $N := \{x \in G: r(x) \neq f(x)\}$ is locally null with respect to the Haar measure $dx$ since for any Borel set $A \subseteq N$ with finite Haar measure we can set $$k(x) := 1_A(x) \cdot \frac{|f(x) - r(x)|}{(f(x) - r(x)) + 1_{G \setminus N}(x)}$$ to obtain a function $k \in L^1(G) \cap L^2(G)$ , so $$0 = \int_G (f(x) - r(x)) \cdot k(x) \, dx = \int_A |f(x) - r(x)| \, dx,$$ i.e. $A \cap N = A$ has Haar measure $0$ . To show $f \in L^2(G)$ we can now equivalently show that $N$ has Haar measure $0$ (it is clear that this is sufficient and it also is necessary by the injectivity of the map in Riesz's theorem), but I haven't managed to reach this conclusion - the claim would follow from the above argumentation if our Haar measure was inner regular on $N$ , but I also don't see why this would be the case. EDIT: It is sufficient to show that $N$ is $\sigma$ -finite and this problem can be reduced further: The set $$R := \{x \in G: r(x) \neq 0\} = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \{x \in G: |r(x)| \geq \tfrac{1}{n}\}$$ is $\sigma$ -finite since $r \in \mathcal{L}^2(G)$ , so $R \cap N$ is again $\sigma$ -finite and locally null. Hence $R \cap N$ has Haar measure $0$ and we only need to worry about the set $$M := (G \setminus R) \cap N = \{x \in G: r(x) = 0 \neq f(x)\}.$$","Update: I decided to post the question on MathOverflow here .

29,Lebesgue measurability: Rudin's vs Tao's,Lebesgue measurability: Rudin's vs Tao's,,"I'm a bit confused about Lebesgue measurability of a set.  I saw two different forms of definition: (1) In Terence Tao's Introduction to Measure Theory , the definition is quite simple.

Then, a subset $B$ of $\mathbb R^p$ is said to be Lebesgue measurable if for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists an open set $U \subset \mathbb R^p$ such that $m^*(U\setminus B)<\epsilon.$ (2) In Walter Rudin's Principles of Mathematical Analysis , the definition is a bit more lengthy: First, the Lebesgue outer measure is defined almost identically to that in Tao's, with the only difference being that $B_n$'s are open elementary sets. Then, $A \subset \mathbb R^p$ is said to be $m$-finitely measurable, if there exists a sequence $\{A_n\}$ of elementary sets such that $A_n \to A,$ where $d(A, A_n) \triangleq m^*((A\setminus A_n)\cup (A_n\setminus A))$.

36,What does it take to have a precise definition of volume?,What does it take to have a precise definition of volume?,,"Many proofs in elementary geometry use an intuitive but imprecise definition of the area or the volume.

On the other hand, my favourite proof of the same theorem (apparently quite close to Euclid's second proof and also discovered by a 12-year old Albert Einstein, see this great article by David Mumford ) is an transparent corollary of the fact that the area of something is multiplied by $\lambda^2$ when the something is dilated by a factor $\lambda$. These and other similar arguments convinced me that what I want of a volume is the two following properties: The volume is additive : if you cut something into two somethings, the volume of the big one is the sum of the volumes of the two little ones (with obvious but quite tedious to write down generalisations if the two little ones aren't disjoint but have a small intersection, for example an intersection included in a hyperplane). The volume is a relative invariant , meaning that if you apply an affine transformation $A$ to a something, its volume is multiplied by $|\det(A)|$. Of course, Lebesgue measure does precisely that.

My question is: if I only want the two properties I've stated (not countable additivity) and only want to measure the volume of very nice things (let's say: polyhedra), how more low-tech can I be? For example, I could probably define the volume by using a simpler, older integration method (Riemann's one, for instance), but can I get significantly more elementary? For example, a natural method would be to cut my polyhedron into simplices, define the volume of a simplex to be the determinant of its contituent vectors (up to some constant, n!, if I'm correct) and declare the volume of the polyhedron to be the sum of the volumes of the simplices. However, you would have to prove that this volume doesn't depend on your choice of decomposition in simplices, and I fear this would be a nightmare to prove elementarily, even more so in higher dimensions where all kind of bad things may happen, like the failure of the Hauptvermutung .

39,Approximating a discrete measure with a continuous one,Approximating a discrete measure with a continuous one,,"In physics it is common to approximate distributions of point masses or charges with continuous distributions. To do this, one typically defines a density function by moving throughout the space a test volume containing many points. In more refined approaches, one can consider the asymptotic behaviour of the average density while enlarging the test volume. From the point of view of measure theory — if I understand it correctly — this would mean constructing a continuous measure in $\mathbb{R}^n$ from a discrete one, so that the continuous measure can be considered, in some sense, an approximation of the discrete one. Is there any standard, formal, way to do such a construction in measure theory? Given the comments below, I reckon that my question above is not clear enough. Here are a few additional remarks: For discrete measure, I mean a measure $\mu$ for which there exists a countable set $A\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ such that its complement is a set of  measure zero, $\mu(\complement A) = 0$. Thus, if $A = \{x_1,x_2,\ldots\}$, the measure can be represented as $\mu = \sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k\delta_{x_k}$, where $\delta_{x_k}$ is the Dirac's measure centred in $x_k$. I would consider both finite and countably infinite sets, because we usually like to speak also of unbounded bodies (e.g. a line of charge). As suggested by @zhoraster in the comments, the first step of the construction is naturally that of weighing (averaging, smoothing) the discrete distribution with a smooth weighing function $\varphi(x)$, normalized so that $$\int\varphi(x)\,\mathrm{d}x = 1.$$ This approach is, for instance, well described in G. Russakoff, ""A derivation of the macroscopic Maxwell equations"" , Am. J. Phys. , 38 , 1188 (I recalled the existence of this paper just today). What I think is missing, from a mathematical point of view, in the given reference and in other treatments is the following. Physicists tend to assume, more or less tacitly (see e.g. also the treatment of the macroscopic Maxwell equations given by Jackson in his Classical electrodynamics ), that the continuous distribution (measure) obtainable by the smoothing process is somehow independent of the chosen weighing function, if its effective volume is large enough to contain many points. I think that the critical point is this one, not that of weighing: so, is there any standard proof in measure theory showing that through a process of smoothing we can obtain a well-defined continuous measure? Maybe I'm overthinking all the above process and things are really much more trivial, but any clarification or pointer to references will be appreciated.","In physics it is common to approximate distributions of point masses or charges with continuous distributions. To do this, one typically defines a density function by moving throughout the space a test volume containing many points. In more refined approaches, one can consider the asymptotic behaviour of the average density while enlarging the test volume. From the point of view of measure theory — if I understand it correctly — this would mean constructing a continuous measure in $\mathbb{R}^n$ from a discrete one, so that the continuous measure can be considered, in some sense, an approximation of the discrete one. Is there any standard, formal, way to do such a construction in measure theory? Given the comments below, I reckon that my question above is not clear enough. Here are a few additional remarks: For discrete measure, I mean a measure $\mu$ for which there exists a countable set $A\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ such that its complement is a set of  measure zero, $\mu(\complement A) = 0$. Thus, if $A = \{x_1,x_2,\ldots\}$, the measure can be represented as $\mu = \sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k\delta_{x_k}$, where $\delta_{x_k}$ is the Dirac's measure centred in $x_k$. I would consider both finite and countably infinite sets, because we usually like to speak also of unbounded bodies (e.g. a line of charge). As suggested by @zhoraster in the comments, the first step of the construction is naturally that of weighing (averaging, smoothing) the discrete distribution with a smooth weighing function $\varphi(x)$, normalized so that $$\int\varphi(x)\,\mathrm{d}x = 1.$$ This approach is, for instance, well described in G. Russakoff, ""A derivation of the macroscopic Maxwell equations"" , Am. J. Phys. , 38 , 1188 (I recalled the existence of this paper just today). What I think is missing, from a mathematical point of view, in the given reference and in other treatments is the following. Physicists tend to assume, more or less tacitly (see e.g. also the treatment of the macroscopic Maxwell equations given by Jackson in his Classical electrodynamics ), that the continuous distribution (measure) obtainable by the smoothing process is somehow independent of the chosen weighing function, if its effective volume is large enough to contain many points.

40,Anti-random reals,Anti-random reals,,"EDIT: This has now been crossposted at MO: https://mathoverflow.net/questions/219366/antirandom-reals . This is partially motivated by my question at mathoverflow: https://mathoverflow.net/questions/218810/relative-null-ness . For a function $f: \mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}_{>0}$ and a set $X\subseteq \mathbb{R}$, an $f$-cover of $X$ is a sequence $(I_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ of open intervals with rational endpoints such that $X\subseteq\bigcup I_n$, and $\mu(I_n)<f(n)$. Say that a set $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ is $f$-small if $X$ has an $f$-cover. Talking about $f$-covers provides us with many different refinements of the notion of ""measure zero"": e.g., a set is strong measure zero if it has an $f$-cover for every function $f$. Say that a set of reals $X$ is computably strong measure zero (csmz) if there is an $e$ such that $\Phi_e^f$ is an $f$-cover of $X$ whenever $f$ is a function from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{R}$. (This is sadly not the same as effective strong measure zero , a notion introduced by Kihara in his thesis; see also Higuchi and Kihara http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016800721400044X .) In computability theory, a real is said (informally) to be ""random"" if it is not in any ""simple"" measure-zero set; there are of course many ways to formalize this, but this is the basic theme. Csmz sets provide a very strong notion of non-randomness: say that an individual real $r$ is antirandom if $\{r\}$ is csmz - equivalently, if $r$ is contained in some csmz set. My question is: What are the antirandom reals? I strongly suspect that every antirandom real is computable, but I can't prove it. TECHNICAL NOTE: the set of antirandom reals is countable - this is because there is a countable set $\{A_i: i\in\omega\}$ of csmz sets such that every csmz set is contained in one of the $A_i$s, it can be forced that every strong measure zero set is countable, and antirandomness is a $\Pi^1_1$ property (so ""there are countably many antirandom reals"" is absolute assuming large cardinals).","EDIT: This has now been crossposted at MO: https://mathoverflow.net/questions/219366/antirandom-reals .

I think that I have a sketch of a proof, but I have not been able to complete it. See below. Any proof/explanation is welcome. Let $(X,\mathcal{B}, \mu)$ be a second countable measure space, and $\mathcal{O}:=\bigcup\{O \subset X: O  \text{ open and }\mu(O)=0\} $. $\mathcal{O}$ is an open set as a union of open sets. Thus, by second countability of $X$, $\mathcal{O} $ can be written as a countable union of open sets extracted from a countable base of $X$, i.e.,   $\mathcal{O}=\bigcup_{n\in \mathbf{N}} O_{\alpha(n)}$, where $\alpha: \mathbf{N} \rightarrow \mathbf{N} $ is an increasing function, and $\{O_n\}_{n \in \mathbf{N}} $ is a base of $X$. Therefore, by $\sigma$-additivity of measures,  \begin{eqnarray*} \mu(\mathcal{O})=\mu(\bigcup_{n\in \mathbf{N}} O_{\alpha(n)})\leqslant \sum_{n \in \mathbf{N}}\mu(O_{\alpha(n)}) \end{eqnarray*} Then, to conclude $\mu(\mathcal{O})=0 $, I would probably like to say that, for all  $n \in \mathbf{N} $, $\mu(O_{\alpha(n)}) =0$.

The only obvious condition is that a possible measure-theoretic definition, if it exists, coincides with the usual differential geometric definition for subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$. I only need such a definition for reasonable subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$. So, at least for me, it doesn't concern to (subsets of) general manifolds.

Let $A \subset [0,1]$ such that $A$ is measurable with $\mu(A) = 0$ ($\mu$ being the Lebesgue measure). Prove that $A^c =  [0,1] \setminus A$ is dense in $[0,1]$. This makes intuitive sense to me $-$ since $\mu(A) = 0$, using that $\mu(X) = \mu(X \cap A) + \mu(X \cap A^c)$ for every $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ we get $\mu([0,1]) = \mu(A) + \mu(A^c) = \{\mu(A)=0\} = \mu(A^c)$. Thus, $A^c$ has the same measure as $[0,1]$. I am aware that this is not the definition of $A^c$ being dense in $[0,1]$ though, and I do not know how to formalize this proof. Any advice would be appreciated.","As a problem during introduction to measure theory, I am asked to prove the following.

97,Cardinality of a set of positive Lebesgue measure,Cardinality of a set of positive Lebesgue measure,,"I have pretty no knowledge in set theory, so likely the question has a trivial answer. All countable subsets of $[0,1]$ have Lebesgue measure of zero, thus all sets of positive Lebesgue measure are uncountable. Does it yet mean that all these sets have same cardinality as $[0,1]$? Clearly, the answer is yes under the continuum hypothesis, but I wonder whether CH is crucial here and what would be the answer without CH. I guess there is no difference whether we consider only Borel sets, or all Lebesgue measurable ones.","I have pretty no knowledge in set theory, so likely the question has a trivial answer.

98,Outer measure is not finitely additive,Outer measure is not finitely additive,,"I know similar questions have been asked before, but I'm looking for clarification of a proof. In Royden's book on real analysis, he proves that every set of positive measure contains a non-measurable set. To prove that outer measures are not finitely additive, he proves the following claim: there are disjoint sets $A,B \subset \mathbb{R}$ for which $m^{*}(A \cup B) < m^{*}(A) + m^{*}(B)$. His proof goes as follows: Assume $m^{*}(A \cup B)= m^{*}(A) + m^{*}(B)$ for every disjoint pair of sets $A$ and $B$. Then, by the definition of measurable set, every set must be measurable. This contradicts the preceding theorem (that every set of positive measure contains a non-measurable set). I'm not exactly seeing the contradiction. Are the details of the proof that every set of positive measure contains a non-measurable set relevant?","I know similar questions have been asked before, but I'm looking for clarification of a proof.
