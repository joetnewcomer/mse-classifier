It is simply asking if it is possible to do so and for me to prove it. I know that $\frac{3\pi}{9}$ can be simplified to $\frac{\pi}{3}$ and that exact values for the sine and cosine of it can be expressed cleanly and other multiples that can be reduced down to $\frac{\pi}{6}$, $\frac{\pi}{4}$, $\frac{\pi}{3}$ etc. But how can I prove that $\frac{\pi}{9}$ itself can be expressed as an exact value?

Using the slope formula, I get $(y-1)=3(x-1)$ Solving for $y$ , I get $y=3x-2$ Therefore, the tangent line equation of the cubic curve at $x=1$ is $y=3x-2$ I would think that the tangent line will only intersects the cubic curve at a single point, but when I typed this into the Desmos Calculator , it intersects on the curve at two points $(1,1)$ and $(-2,-8)$ .

After reading some answers, I have developed some ideas, and i don't know if they are right... When $ x\rightarrow \infty  $ , I always choose to neglect terms with lower orders than x. For example, $$ \lim_{x\rightarrow \infty} \frac{\left( 1+2x \right) ^{10}\left( 1+3x \right) ^{20}}{\left( 1+6x \right) ^{15}} $$ I would transform it into $$ \lim_{x\rightarrow \infty} \frac{\left( 2x \right) ^{10}\left( 3x \right) ^{20}}{\left( 6x \right) ^{15}} $$ And the calculation result is correct.

I have only ever done tests for convergence of infinite sums. At this link it shows a way to convert but in this case an is less than one for all k. I can see that $ f(k) = 1 - \tan( \pi/2^k)^4 $ is a strictly increasing function and in fact it is increasing very quickly however it is bound [ $ 1 - \tan( \pi/2^3)^4$, 1) where the lower bound is quite nearly one. This seems to mean it will converge to something slightly less than the lower bound of the function. I see that is converges. I want to know if there analytic method to provide a closed from of the solution such as with an alternating series. I figure I can simply do it computationally with MatLab and it would be very simple but I thought there must another way.","So I found this $$\prod_{k=3}^{\infty} 1 - \tan( \pi/2^k)^4$$ here .
