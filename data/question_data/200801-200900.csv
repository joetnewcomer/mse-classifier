0,Role of Group actions in Differential Geometry,Role of Group actions in Differential Geometry,,"This is a rather soft question, my hope is to bring some order into the stuff I would like to learn about differential geometry -- here it is: I was told over and over again that Geometry has to do with angles, length of curves, curvature etc. However, most graduate textbooks on Differential Geometry start with smooth manifolds and keep studying them without every mentioning the presence of a Riemannian metric. And then there are group actions acting on smooth manifolds -- here I see the use of the word ""Geometry"" as well when results are obtained regarding the basic structure of the manifold, such as the way orbits are arranged, whether there are special orbits and how orbits smoothly collapse, whether these are certain bundles and so on. I guess my question is the following: Is the study of group actions on smooth manifolds ""more fundamental"" than Riemannian geometry, or can one reduce any group action on a manifold to the presence of a (unique?) Riemannian metric on $M$ and study that metric instead? If not, are there ""geometric"" aspects of a smooth manifold that one cannot frame in terms of a group action?

Say $c_v(\varepsilon) = \exp_p(\varepsilon v)$ and $c_w(\varepsilon) = \exp_p(\varepsilon w)$ for some tangent vectors $v,w\in T_p(M)$. Edit 3 : With the counterexamples in the answers in mind, we should assume the geodesics will need to form a triangle $\triangle(p, c_v(1),c_w(1))$ whose side lengths are within some (nonzero) lower and upper bounds. Let $L(\varepsilon)=\mathrm{dist}(c_v(\varepsilon),c_w(\varepsilon)$) be the distance between corresponding points $\varepsilon$ out on the geodesics. One can use the nonpositive curvature to get convexity of $L$ and prove that if $L(\varepsilon)$ looks linear at any one point, i.e. $L(\varepsilon_0) = \varepsilon_0 L(1)$, then this in fact is true for all $\varepsilon$, not just $\varepsilon_0$.  Consequently, the curvature of the $v,w$ plane at $p$ is $0$. Does an approximate version of this hold? That is, if we know some $\varepsilon_0$ has $L(\varepsilon_0)$ ""close to"" $\varepsilon_0 L(1)$, does this mean the sectional curvature of the $u,v$ plane at $p$ is ""close to"" $0$? This seems intuitive, at least if there's some kind of homogeneity or lots of symmetry , but I'm not very familiar with curvature, and can't seem to piece together a formal justification of this. If anyone knows and can explain this, or has a good reference to look at that discusses this function $L$ in detail, I'd appreciate it.  This seems like something that should be known or easy to someone in the area.  I've been trying to learn this material, and have seen a few references talking about geodesic variations and $L$ near $0$, but I'm not sure if I'm getting anywhere.  Of course, if it isn't true, I'd like to know why, or if it is true in slightly nicer spaces. Thanks! Edit To try to comment more on how I think an argument might go: My guess is that the curvature as you move along the geodesics is nonincreasing, so the amount of convexity (i.e. 2nd derivative) of $L(\varepsilon)$ is nondecreasing.  This, along with the convexity of $L$ provides some bounds on $L$ on $(0,\varepsilon_0)$.  Specifically, it must be under the line through $(0,0)$ and $(\varepsilon_0, L(\varepsilon_0))$ in order to be convex at all, and above the quadratic through $(0,0)$, $(\varepsilon_0, L(\varepsilon_0))$, and $(1,L(1))$ in order to satisfy the 2nd derivative requirement.  This seems to control the Riemannian angle and curvature at $p$. In what spaces would we know the curvature is nonincreasing and that argument makes some sense? Edit 2 The only answer below shows that this won't work as generally as I originally discussed this problem.  So, I'm interested in when it does hold.

There is $Z:\;U\times(-\varepsilon,\varepsilon)\;\rightarrow \mathbb R^3 ,\;\varepsilon> 0$, which is a Variation of X of Class $C^2$, with the property that $Z(w,0)=X$ for all $w \in U$. By Taylor expansion we get:  $Z(w,\varepsilon) =X(w)+Y(w)+\varepsilon^2 R(w,\varepsilon)$, where $R$ is a continous remainder term. $Y(w)= \frac{\partial}{\partial\varepsilon}Z(w,\varepsilon)|_\varepsilon \in C^1(U,\mathbb R^3) $ is called the first variation of the family of surfaces $Z(.,\varepsilon)$. For partial derivations we use $ {\partial X}/{\partial u^\beta}=X_{u^\beta}$. Now we can write $Y(w) =\sum \eta^\beta(w)X_{u^\beta} + \lambda(w)N(w)$ with $\beta \in {{1,2}}$ and $w = (u,v) =(u^1,u^2)$ with functions $\eta^1,\eta^2,\lambda $ of class $C^1(U)$. QUESTION: Performing a partial integration, it follows that: $\int_U [\;(\eta^1\mathcal W)_u +(\eta^2 \mathcal W)_v\;]\;du dv= \int_{\partial U}\mathcal W(\eta^1 dv-\eta^2du)$ This is supposed to be partial integration with the help of the divergence theorem. But as i understood partial integration, there has to be a vectorfield there, which isn't, and a continous scalarfunction. The thing is, with what i got, i don't know where to start from. Any first hints to get me going would be very appreciated. Thank you in advance, marcel",,"['differential-geometry', 'calculus-of-variations']"

Then, the wedge product of two harmonic forms is not necessarily harmonic, as explained for instance here . This prompts the question of whether the product of a $\mathcal{C}^\infty$ -antiharmonic form $\alpha \in \mathcal{A}^{p,q}(X)$ with a harmonic form $\beta \in \mathcal{H}^{r,s}(X)$ is antiharmonic. Here, a $\mathcal{C}^\infty$ -differential form $\alpha \in \mathcal{A}^{p,q}(X)$ is said to be antiharmonic if $\alpha$ is orthogonal to any harmonic form, with respect to the Hodge inner product $(\alpha,\beta) := \int_X \alpha \wedge (\ast \beta)$ , where $\ast$ denotes the Hodge $\ast$ -operator. In particular, thanks to the Hodge decomposition, we know that the group of antiharmonic forms coincides with $\mathrm{Im}(d) \oplus \mathrm{Im}(d^\ast)$ , where $d$ is the usual exterior differential, and $d^\ast$ is its adjoint with respect to the $\ast$ -operator. Such a statement is clearly true if $\alpha = d(\gamma)$ , since the product of a $d$ -exact form with a $d$ -closed one is again exact, thanks to Leibniz's rule. Therefore, by the Hodge decomposition the only case left to consider is $\alpha = d^\ast(\gamma)$ . Is it reasonable to expect that $d^\ast(\gamma) \beta \subseteq \mathrm{Im}(d) \oplus \mathrm{Im}(d^\ast)$ , or is this not true? I would be particularly interested in this property when $p = q = 0$ , i.e. when $\alpha = f$ is a function such that $\int_X f \cdot \Omega^n = 0$ , where $\Omega \in \mathcal{A}^{1,1}(X)$ is the Kähler form associated to the Kähler metric on $X$ . Analogously, one can say that $f = \Delta(g)$ where $g = G(f)$ and $G$ is Green's operator. Therefore, the previous question amounts to ask whether $\int_X \Delta(g) \beta_1 \wedge (\ast \beta_2) = 0$ for every smooth function $g$ and every pair of harmonic forms $\beta_1,\beta_2 \in \mathcal{H}^{p,q}(X)$ , where $\ast$ denotes the Hodge $\ast$ -operator. Finally, note that this question is intimately related to the behaviour of the orthogonal projection $H \colon \mathcal{A}^{p,q}(X) \to \mathcal{H}^{p,q}(X)$ . More precisely, is it true that $H$ is a map of $\mathcal{C}^\infty(X)$ -modules, i.e. that $H(f \alpha) = H(f) H(\alpha)$ for every smooth function $f$ and every $\alpha \in \mathcal{A}^{p,q}(X)$ ? Note that $H(f)$ is a constant, so this property might be too much to be true. Moreover, note that an analogous statement is not true in general if $f$ is replaced by a differential form of higher degree, unless we are in a situation where the wedge product of two harmonic differential forms is harmonic.","Let be a compact Kähler manifold, with fixed Kähler form .

It is well-known that the one-form $$ \omega = \frac{x \mathrm{d}y - y \mathrm{d}x}{x^2 + y^2} $$ is closed on $\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \{ 0 \}$ (as can be verified by direct calculation), but is not exact. As a result, integrals of $\omega$ along non-homotopic paths can yield different results. Of course, in the back of our heads, we know that $\omega$ is at least locally exact: it is the differential of $\arctan (y / x)$ . Of course, I accept that this function is not well-defined on all of $\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \{ 0 \}$ ; for example, it is clearly not well-defined at $x = 0$ . This is closely related to the fact that $\arctan(y/x)$ has a branch cut, and cannot be continuously defined on all of $\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \{ 0 \}$ . However, consider the following approach: instead of considering functions $f : \mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \{ 0 \} \to \mathbb{R}$ , consider instead a function $\varphi : \mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \{ 0 \} \to S^1$ , defined by $$ e^{i \varphi(x,y)} = \frac{x+iy}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} $$ Here I'm considering $S^1$ as the unit circle in $\mathbb{C}$ , for convenience. Clearly $\varphi(x,y)$ is a smooth $S^1$ -valued function on all of $\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \{ 0 \}$ . On the other hand, whereas the original target space $\mathbb{R}$ was simply-connected, the new target space $S^1$ is not! As a result, $\varphi$ can ""wind"" by $2\pi n$ around the origin. On the other hand, it's not at all clear that $d\varphi = \omega$ in the way I want it to. Indeed, it's not clear to me if one can even define the exterior derivative on a function $\varphi : M \to S^1$ the same way as for a function $f : M \to \mathbb{R}$ . I suspect the reason that it 'seems' like it might work with $\varphi$ is because, whereas $\varphi$ is $S^1$ -valued, its derivative is $\mathbb{R}$ -valued. If I instead had an $S^2$ -valued function (i.e., a function $\psi : M \to S^2$ ), I'm not sure how I'd generalize at all. So, here is the final question: what is the mathematically precise way to describe the fact that $\omega$ has a well-defined antiderivative $\varphi(x,y)$ on all of $\mathbb{R}^2 / \{ 0 \}$ , despite not being exact, by allowing the target space of $\varphi$ to be $S^1$ instead of $\mathbb{R}$ ? EDIT: Just to be completely clear, in order to address some of the comments: I am considering here $S^1$ to be the set $\mathbb{R} / \sim$ , where $x \sim x + 2\pi n$ for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ . Then $\varphi : \mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \{ 0 \} \to S^1$ , and $e^{i \varphi(x,y)}$ lies on the unit circle in $\mathbb{C}$ . As a map between manifolds, $\varphi(x,y)$ is a smooth map; I'm certain that this could be verified by putting down coordinate charts, but it should be plainly obvious by noting that $\varphi$ is just the angular coordinate of the complex variable $z = x+iy$ .","I have a simple question on the classic example of a closed form not being exact.

71,Inequality in proof of Huisken's theorem,Inequality in proof of Huisken's theorem,,"Suppose $M$ is a uniformly convex hypersurface in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ ( $A\geq \alpha Hg$ for $\alpha>0$ ) undergoing mean curvature flow. $A$ denotes the second fundamental form and $H$ denotes the mean curvature. The proof of Huisken's theorem uses a uniform bound on the following quantity. $$   f_{\sigma,\epsilon} = \left(|A - \frac1nHg|^2-\epsilon H^2\right)H^{2-\sigma} $$ for some $\sigma\in (0,1)$ and all $\epsilon>0$ . This is done by computing the evolution of $f_{\sigma, \epsilon}$ , estimating some of the terms, and then using the maximum principle. I am confused about the following inequality in p.294 of Extrinsic Geometric Flows by Andrews et. al: $$ \gamma \frac{|\nabla A|^2}{H^2}H^\sigma\geq \gamma f_{\sigma,\epsilon}\frac{|\nabla A|^2}{H^2} \tag{1} $$ This implies that $H^\sigma\geq f_{\sigma,\epsilon}$ since $\gamma>0$ and $H>0$ . However, using $|A|^2\leq H^2$ , the best inequality I can get is \begin{align*} \frac{f_{\sigma,\epsilon}}{H^\sigma} = \frac{|A|^2}{H^2}+1-\frac{2}{n}-\epsilon\leq 2-\frac{2}{n}-\epsilon\,. \end{align*} In fact, using uniform convexity $A\geq \alpha Hg$ , we have $$ \frac{f_{\sigma,\epsilon}}{H^\sigma} =\frac{|A|^2}{H^2}+1-\frac{2}{n}-\epsilon\geq \alpha + 1-\frac{2}{n}-\epsilon $$ so for large $\alpha$ we would have $f_{\sigma,\epsilon}\geq H^\sigma$ . What am I missing here? I have added an excerpt from the book below. Context : one of the terms in the evolution equation for $f_{\sigma, \epsilon}$ is $$-2H^\sigma|\nabla\frac{A}{H}|^2$$ Then, in p.294 they show that if $A\geq \alpha Hg$ for $\alpha>0$ , then $$ |\nabla\frac{A}{H}|^2\geq \gamma\frac{|\nabla A|^2}{H^2} $$ where $\gamma$ depends on $\alpha$ and $n$ . Since $A\geq \alpha Hg$ is preserved under mean curvature flow, the above inequality holds for as long as the flow exists with the same constant $\gamma$ . This leads to the left side of (1).

Let $f$ be a smooth function on a Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$ s.t. $$ \text{Hess}(f)(\nabla f, X) = \frac 12 (\mathcal L_{\nabla f} g)(\nabla f, X) = \lambda g(\nabla f, X) $$ for any smooth vector field $X$ , where $\nabla f$ is the gradient of $f$ , characterized by $$ g(\nabla f, X) = \text d f(X). $$ For brevity, write $Y = \nabla f$ , $b = g(Y, Y)$ , and $\theta_Y (X) = g(X, Y)$ . Note that, by the definition of the gradient, $\theta_Y(X) = \text d f(X)$ , so $\text d \theta_Y = 0$ .

Theorem (Scalar weak maximum principle): Let $M$ be a compact manifold with boundary and $g_t$ a smooth family of Riemannian metrics on $M$ for $t\in [0,T]$ . Suppose that for $u\in C^2(M\times[0,T])$ and $U\in C^1([0,T])$ we have \begin{align}         \partial_t u &\leq \Delta_{g_t} u + f(u,t)\,, && \text{on } M\times[0,T]\tag{1}\\         u &\leq U &&\text{on }(M\times\{0\})\cup (\partial M\times[0,T])\tag{2}\\         \partial_t U(t) &\geq f(U(t),t) && t\in [0,T]\tag{3} \end{align} where $f:\mathbb{R}\times[0,T]\longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is Lipschitz in the first variable and continuous in the second. Then, $u \leq U$ on $M\times[0,T]$ . The standard proof can be found in the book The Ricci Flow: An Introduction by Chow and Knopf. Here is an alternative proof I found in lecture notes for a course by Richard Bamler (found here ). His notes don't go into details, so I have tried filling them out myself. proof: First assume that we have strict inequalities in (2) and (3). Choose $t^*\in [0,T]$ maximal so that $u(\cdot, t) \leq U(t)$ for all $t\in [0, t^*]$ . Since (2) is assumed to be a strict inequality, we have that $t^*>0$ . Suppose that $t^*<T$ . Then there exists $x^*\in M\setminus \partial M$ such that $u(x^*,t^*) = U(t^*)$ . Since $x^*$ is a local maximum of $u(\cdot, t^*)$ , we have $\nabla u(x^*,t^*) = 0$ and $\Delta u(x^*,t^*)\leq 0$ . Moreover $\partial_t u(x^*,t^*)\geq \partial_tU(t^*)$ . Then combining (1) - (3) and evaluating at $(x^*,t^*)$ gives $$     \partial_t U(t^*) \leq \Delta u(x^*,t^*) + f(u(x^*,t^*),t^*) \leq f(U(t^*),t^*) < \partial_tU(t^*) $$ which is a contradiction. Define $U_\epsilon(t) = U(t) + \epsilon t + \epsilon^2$ . Then $u(x, t) < U_\epsilon(t)$ for $(x,t)\in \partial_{\text{par}}(M\times[0,T])$ . Since $f$ is Lipschitz, we have for some $C>0$ \begin{align*}     f(U_\epsilon(t), t) &\leq f(U(t),t) + C(\epsilon t + \epsilon^2)\\     &\leq \partial_tU(t) + C(\epsilon t+\epsilon^2)\\     &= \partial_t U_\epsilon(t) + C(\epsilon t+\epsilon^2) -\epsilon  \end{align*} For sufficiently small $\epsilon$ choose $\tau\in (0,T]$ independent of $\epsilon$ such that $\tau < 1/C-\epsilon $ . Then whenever $t\leq\tau$ we have $$     C(\epsilon t+\epsilon^2)-\epsilon \leq C(\epsilon \tau+\epsilon^2)-\epsilon < C(\epsilon (1/C-\epsilon)+\epsilon^2)-\epsilon = 0\,. $$ Thus, for $t\in [0,\tau]$ we have $f(U_\epsilon(t),t)<\partial_tU_\epsilon(t)$ . By the previous case we therefore have that $u \leq U_\epsilon$ on $M\times [0,\tau]$ . Letting $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$ , we have $u \leq U$ on $M\times [0,\tau]$ . Clearly the subset of $u-U\leq 0$ is closed in $M\times [0,T]$ , thus we may assume $\tau$ is chosen maximally. If $\tau < T$ then we can repeat the above procedure with the time shift $t\mapsto t-\tau$ and $T\mapsto T-\tau$ . Thus $\tau = T$ . Question: Is this proof correct? My issue is the inequality $\tau < 1/C$ . This seems to put a constraint on the maximum time $T$ .

76,How do we construct the cotangent space?,How do we construct the cotangent space?,,"I am following a graduate course in algebraic geometry and our professor introduced last week the cotangent space at a point p of a variety as the quotient $m/m^2$ where $m$ is the maximal ideal of the local ring at the point p. This is completely clear to me. He then proceeded to explain some equivalent definitions in differential geometry, which I understood much less, given that I have just followed a quite easy introductory course. First off he said that in general we have a map $d: C(V)\rightarrow M$ , where $M$ is the cotangent space of all vector fields and $C(V)$ the smooth functions on the manifold, which sends $f\mapsto df$ . He called $df$ ""the one form df"" and gave no further explanation as to what it is, which is not clear to me. I especially don't understand how it acts on the space of all vector fields. He then went on to say that the cotangent space of all vector fields could also be defined to be generated by the elements ""of the form dr"" with r an element of the ring of continuous functions, imposing the relations given by Leibniz rule on them.

Uniqueness: Suppose that there exists a vector field $G$ on $TM$ with (+). Choose $q\in TM$ . By assumption, we then know that the trajectory $\alpha:(-\delta,\delta)\to M$ with $\alpha'(t)=G(\alpha(t))$ and $\alpha(0)=q$ is of the form $\alpha(t)=(\gamma(t),\gamma'(t))$ , where $\gamma$ is a geodesic of $M$ . Now $\gamma$ , in local coordinates, has to satisfy a first order system with initial conditions given by $q$ , for which there is a unique solution. Since $\alpha'(0)=G(\alpha(0))=G(q)$ and $\alpha$ is completly determined by this unique solution $\gamma$ , we conclude that $G(q)$ is also uniquely determined. Since this holds for every $q\in TM$ , $G$ has to be unique. In order to show existence, do Carmo locally defines $G$ by the system mentioned above. It follows that the trajectories of $G$ are of the form $(\gamma,\gamma')$ . He finishes the proof by stating: Using the uniqueness, we conclude that $G$ is well-defined on $TM$ . My idea: In the uniqueness argument, we have shown that $G(q)$ is uniquely determined for every $q\in TM$ . It follows that for every open subset $O\subset TM$ , there also exists at most one vector field with the property (+). Now let $x:U\subset \mathbb{R}^n \to M$ and $y:V\subset \mathbb{R}^n \to M$ be two parametrizations with $x(U)\cap y(V)\neq \phi$ and denote by $G_x$ and $G_y$ their corresponding vector fields on $x(U)$ and $y(V)$ which satisfy (+) (which we know exist by the construction above). Then $G_x$ and $G_y$ also satisfy (+) on the open set $x(U)\cap y(V)$ . It follows that $G_x\bigg|_{x(U)\cap y(V)}=G_y\bigg|_{x(U)\cap y(V)},$ which shows that $G$ is well-defined. I am not sure if this argument is correct. It also seems a little too complicated to me/not what do Carmo intended. I would be grateful for any other (easier) proof of this fact which uses the uniqueness-part.

86,Spin derivative on a submanifold,Spin derivative on a submanifold,,"I am having some trouble proving the following expression. For a 3-manifold $Y$ , spinor bundle $S$ , codimension 1 submanifold $M\subset Y$ , subbundle $S_M$ , and normal vector $N$ , the covariant derivative is $$\nabla_X ^S \phi=\nabla_X^{S_M} \phi|_M -\frac{1}{2}\nabla_X^{M}N\cdot N\cdot \phi,$$ where the $\cdot$ are Clifford products, $X\in TM$ and $\phi \in \Gamma(S)$ . I first saw this here , which references here , which references something in German. So what I've tried so far: That book (Baum et al) gives the following formula for the spin derivative: $$\nabla_X^S \phi=X(\phi)+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{1\leq k < l\leq n} \omega_{kl} s_k\cdot s_l\cdot \phi$$ that spin connection is defined as $\omega_{kl}=g(\nabla ^M s_k,s_l)$ with orthogonal coordinates (""tetrads"", I think) $(s_1,s_2,...)$ I think I understand those like $$\omega_{jk}=<\nabla_X e_j,e_k>=<\omega^i_j e_i,e_k>,$$ where the $\omega^i_j$ are what I am more used to seeing, i.e. from tetrads, and the inner product is over the manifold coordinates. If I use this expression to try and directly derive what I can't get from above, I get $$\nabla_X ^S \phi-\nabla_X^{S_M} \phi|_M =\frac{1}{2}\sum_{1\leq k < l\leq n} \omega_{kl}s_k\cdot s_l\cdot \phi-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{1\leq k < l\leq n-1} \omega_{kl}s_k\cdot s_l\cdot \phi|_M$$ So a bunch of terms on the right cancel, and I think you are left with $$\frac{1}{2}(\omega_{1,3}s_1+\omega_{2,3}s_2)\cdot s_3\cdot \phi$$ just two terms, and the spinor is the one from $S$ . So I want to relate this to the covariant derivative of the normal vector, which I guess I want to express in the tetrad basis (say $N=N_3 s_3$ and $X=X_aS_a$ picking the normal and tangent directions so that a,b,c=1,2), $$ \nabla_X N=X_a\nabla_a (N_3 s_3)=X_a N_3 (\partial_a s_3+\omega_{a3b} s_b)=X_a N_3 \omega_{a3b}\cdot s_b=\omega_{3b} N_3\cdot s_b$$ (repeated indices summed, and that partial vanishes since $a,b\neq 3$ ). So this is kinda close, since the sum indeed gives me two terms, but I don't actually have the right number of spinors - $N_3$ is just the component here. So there are several steps here I am a bit uncomfortable with, but if I had gotten down to something like $\omega_{23}$ I would think I was basically doing it correctly.

Let $B$ denote the closed unit ball centered at the origin in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^m$ , $\partial B$ denote the boundary sphere of $B$ and $B^o$ denote the interior of $B$ . Let $f_i: \mathbb{R}^m \to M$ , $i=1,2$ denote smooth embeddings into a smooth $m$ -dimensional manifold $M$ which satisfy $$f_1(\mathbb{R}^m) \cup f_2(\mathbb{R}^m) = M$$ $$f_1(\mathbb{R}^m \setminus B^o) \subset f_2(B^o) $$ $$f_2(\mathbb{R}^m \setminus B^o) \subset f_1(B^o) $$ Suppose that $m \geq 2$ . Show that $M$ is a simply connected closed manifold. Here is what I have been able to do so far. Proof that M is closed: Let $\{x_i\}$ be a sequence in $M$ , then we can subtract a subseqeunce $\{x_{i_j}\}$ which is contained entirely within $f_1(\mathbb{R}^m)$ or entirely within $f_2(\mathbb{R}^m)$ . Suppose without loss of generality that $\{x_{i_j}\}$ is contained entirely within $f_1(\mathbb{R}^m)$ , then we can subtract a subsubsequence $\{x_{i_{j_k}}\}$ which is contained entirely within $f_1(B)$ or entirely within $f_1(\mathbb{R}^m \setminus B^o)$ . Suppose first that $\{x_{i_{j_k}}\}$ is contained entirely within $f_1(B)$ then by compactness of $f_1(B)$ there is subsubsubsequence $\{x_{i_{j_{k_l}}}\}$ which converges in $f_1(B)$ . If instead the subsubsequence $\{x_{i_{j_k}}\}$ is contained entirely within $f_1(\mathbb{R}^m \setminus B^o)$ , then by assumption the subsubsequence is contained within $f_2(B)$ , which is compact, so there is a subsubsubsequence $\{x_{i_{j_{k_l}}}\}$ which converges. Hence $M$ is compact. Since $f_1$ , and $f_2$ are charts without boundary that covers $M$ , then $M$ is a manifold without boundary, so $M$ is closed. I am unable to show that $M$ is simply connected. It is connected, as it is the union of two connected sets with non-empty intersection. If $f_1(\mathbb{R}^m) \cap f_2(\mathbb{R}^m)$ is connected then by the Seifert-Van Kampen Theorem $M$ would be simply connected. My idea has been to try and come up with suitable open subsets $U, V$ and then use the Mayer-Vietoris sequence to show that the 0th de Rham Cohomology group of $f_1(\mathbb{R}^m) \cap f_2(\mathbb{R}^m)$ has dimension 1. None of my candidates for $U$ and $V$ has worked so far. The result fails when $m=1$ since then $M=S^1$ . I am not sure how to invoke the $m \geq 2$ hypothesis, if the problem is to be solved without a Mayer-Vietoris argument. The problem should be solvable using techniques from Topology (By Munkres) and Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (By Lee). This means no Generalized Jordan Curve Theorem, Reduced Integral Homology or Alexander Duality.

98,Geodesics of The Tangent Bundle,Geodesics of The Tangent Bundle,,"Suppose $(M,g)$ is a complete Riemannian manifold. We can endow the tangent bundle $TM$ with a natural choice of metric, the so called Sasaki metric given by: $\alpha(t)=(p(t),v(t))$ , $\beta(t)=(q(t),w(t))$ . Then define $\langle\alpha^\prime(0),\beta^\prime(0)\rangle=\langle p^\prime(0),q^\prime(0)\rangle+\langle\frac{Dv}{dt}(0),\frac{Dw}{dt}(0)\rangle$ . In other words we identify the vertical vectors at $T_{(p,v)}TM$ with $T_pM$ and the Euclidean metric given on that by $g$ . Then we pullback $g$ by $D\pi: H \to TM$ to the horizontal vectors and define $H$ and $VE$ to be orthogonal to each other. In this metric one can prove if $\gamma(t)$ is a geodesic and $v(t)$ a parallel vector field along $\gamma$ , then $(\gamma(t),v(t))$ is a geodesic in $TM$ . Now suppose $(p,v)$ and $(q,w)$ are two arbitrary points in $TM$ and $\gamma$ is a geodesic with $\gamma(0)=p, \gamma(1)=q$ . Consider $v(t),w(t)$ which are the parallel transports of $v$ and $w$ along $\gamma$ . Is it true that the curve $\delta(t)=(\gamma(t),(1-t)v(t)+tw(t))$ is a geodesic between $(p,v)$ and $(q,w)$ ? Notice that if $w$ is the parallel transport of $v$ at $t=1$ then $\delta(t)$ is a geodesic.

99,Does the pushforward of a smooth map on a manifold coincide with the derivative in a tangent direction of any local extension?,Does the pushforward of a smooth map on a manifold coincide with the derivative in a tangent direction of any local extension?,,"Let $d\in\mathbb N$ , $k\in\{1,\ldots,d\}$ , $M$ be a $k$ -dimensional embedded $C^1$ -submanifold of $\mathbb R^d$ with boundary, $x\in M$ , $$T_x\:M:=\{\gamma'(0):\gamma\text{ is a }C^1\text{-curve on }M\text{ through }x\}$$ denote the tangent space of $M$ at $x$ , $E$ be a $\mathbb R$ -Banach space and $f:M\to E$ be $C^1$ -differentiable at $x$ , i.e. $$\left.f\right|_{O\:\cap\:M}=\left.\tilde f\right|_{O\:\cap\:M}\tag1$$ for some $\tilde f\in C^1(O,E)$ for some $\mathbb R^d$ -open neighborhood $O$ of $x$ . If I got it right, the problem with defining the derivative of $f$ at $x$ to be ${\rm D}\tilde f(x)$ is that this definition would not be well-defined, since the operator ${\rm D}\tilde f(x)$ does depend on the choice of $\tilde f$ . Now, it's easy to see that $C^1$ -differentiability of $f$ at $x$ is equivalent to the $C^1$ -differentiability of $f\circ\phi^{-1}$ for some $k$ -dimensional chart $\phi$ of $M$ around $x$ (i.e. $\phi$ is a $C^1$ -diffeomorphism from an $M$ -open subset $\Omega$ onto an open subst of $\mathbb H^k:=\mathbb R^{k-1}\times[0,\infty)$ ). This fact can be used to show that if $v\in T_x\:M$ and $\gamma$ is any $C^1$ -curve on $M$ through $x$ with $\gamma'(0)=v$ , then $${\rm D}_xf(v):=(f\circ\gamma)'(0)\tag2$$ is well-defined, i.e. independent of the choice of $\gamma$ . (The crucial thing is that the derivative on a half space, like the interval on which $\gamma$ is defined or the open subset $\phi(\Omega)$ of $\mathbb H^k$ on which $\phi^{-1}$ is defined, does not depend on the choice of a differentiable local extension: Differentiability at the boundary of a function on a half space ) Now I've got two questions: Can we show that, if $v\in T_x\:M$ as above, then $${\rm D}_xf(v)={\rm D}\tilde f(x)v\tag3,$$ where ${\rm D}\tilde f(x)$ is the Fréchet derivative of $\tilde f$ at $x$ and hence ${\rm D}\tilde f(x)v$ is the ordinary directional derivative of $\tilde f$ at $x$ in direction $v$ ? If $x$ is in the topological interior $\operatorname{Int}M$ of $M$ , can we conclude that $$T_x\:M=\mathbb R^d\tag4$$ and that $(3)$ holds for all $v\in\mathbb R^d$ ? Regarding 2.: Since $O\cap\operatorname{Int}M$ is open, $$B_\varepsilon(x)\subseteq O\cap M\tag5$$ for some $\varepsilon>0$ and hence it should follow from $(1)$ that $f$ is actually continuously Fréchet differentiable at $x$ and $${\rm D}f(x)={\rm D}\tilde f(x)\tag6.$$ Moreover, if $v\in\mathbb R^d\setminus\{0\}$ , then $$\gamma(t):=x+tv\in B_\varepsilon(x)\;\;\;\text{for }t\in I:=\left(-\frac\varepsilon{\left\|v\right\|},\frac\varepsilon{\left\|v\right\|}\right).$$ By construction, $\gamma\in C^1(I,M)$ with $\gamma(0)=x$ and $\gamma'(0)=v$ and $$(f\circ\gamma)'(0)={\rm D}f(\gamma(0))\gamma'(0)={\rm D}f(x)v\tag7$$ by the chain rule. This should yield both $(2)$ and $(3)$ . 1: If $E_i$ is a $\mathbb R$ -Banach space, $\Omega_1\subseteq E_1$ and $g:\Omega_1\to E_2$ , then $f$ is called $C^1$ -differentiable at $x_1\in\Omega_1$ if $$\left.g\right|_{O_1\:\cap\:\Omega_1}=\left.\tilde g\right|_{O_1\:\cap\:\Omega_1}$$ for some $\tilde g\in C^1(O_1,E_2)$ for some $E_1$ -open neighborhood $O_1$ of $x_1$ . $f$ is called $C^1$ -differentiable if it is $C^1$ -differentiable at $x_1$ for all $x_1\in\Omega_1$ , which is equivalent to $$g=\left.h\right|_{O_1}$$ for some $h\in C^1(O_1,E_2)$ for some $E_1$ -open neighborhood $O_1$ of $\Omega_1$ . 2: $\gamma$ is called $C^1$ -curve on $M$ through $x$ if $\gamma:I\to M$ , where $I$ is a nontrivial interval with $0\in I$ , is $C^1$ -differentiable with $\gamma(0)=x$ .","Let , , be a -dimensional embedded -submanifold of with boundary, , denote the tangent space of at , be a -Banach space and be -differentiable at , i.e. for some for some -open neighborhood of .
