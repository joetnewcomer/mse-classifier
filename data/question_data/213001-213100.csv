4,Two different trigonometric identities giving two different solutions,Two different trigonometric identities giving two different solutions,,"Using two different sum-difference trigonometric identities gives two different results in a task where the choice of identity seemed unimportant. The task goes as following: Given  $\cos 2x =-\frac {63}{65} $ , $\cos y=\frac {7} {\sqrt{130}}$, under the condition $0<x,y<\frac {\pi}{2}$, calculate $x+y$. The first couple of steps are the same: finding  $\sin$ and $\cos$ values for both $x$ and $y$.

Solutions are: $x+y= \{\frac {\pi}{4}, \frac {3\pi}{4} \}$ cos(x+y) : \begin{align*} \cos(x+y) &= \cos x \cos y - \sin x \sin y =\frac {1} {\sqrt{65}} \frac {7} {\sqrt{130}} - \frac {8} {\sqrt{65}}\frac {9} {\sqrt{130}} \\ \cos(x+y) &=-\frac {65} {\sqrt{65}\sqrt{130}} \\ \cos(x+y) &=-\frac {\sqrt{2}}{2} \end{align*} Thus, $x+y =\frac {3\pi}{4}+2k{\pi} $   OR   $x+y =\frac {5\pi}{4}+2k{\pi}$ Now we can only have one solution: $x+y=\{\frac {3\pi}{4}\}$ Similar happens with $\cos(x-y)$.

Firstly, let's use the sum-to-product formulas for sine and cosine: For sine: $$\sin A + \sin B = 2\sin\left(\frac{A+B}{2}\right)\cos\left(\frac{A-B}{2}\right),$$ For cosine: $$\cos A + \cos B = 2\cos\left(\frac{A+B}{2}\right)\cos\left(\frac{A-B}{2}\right).$$ Applying these to our equations, we get: For the first equation: $$\sin x + \sin 5x = 2\sin\left(\frac{x+5x}{2}\right)\cos\left(\frac{x-5x}{2}\right) = 2\sin(3x)\cos(-2x) = 2\sin(3x)\cos(2x),$$ and thus: $$2\sin(3x)\cos(2x) + \sin 3x = 1.$$ For the second equation: $$\cos x + \cos 5x = 2\cos\left(\frac{x+5x}{2}\right)\cos\left(\frac{x-5x}{2}\right) = 2\cos(3x)\cos(-2x) = 2\cos(3x)\cos(2x),$$ and thus: $$2\cos(3x)\cos(2x) + \cos 3x = \sqrt{2} + 1.$$ Now we solve for $\sin(3x)$ and $\cos(3x)$ : From the first equation: $$2\sin(3x)\cos(2x) + \sin 3x = 1,$$ $$\Rightarrow \sin 3x (2\cos(2x) + 1) = 1.$$ From the second equation: $$2\cos(3x)\cos(2x) + \cos 3x = \sqrt{2} + 1,$$ $$\Rightarrow \cos 3x (2\cos(2x) + 1) = \sqrt{2} + 1.$$ Dividing the two equations to eliminate $\cos(2x)$ , we get: $$\frac{\sin 3x (2\cos(2x) + 1)}{\cos 3x (2\cos(2x) + 1)} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} + 1},$$ $$\Rightarrow \frac{\sin 3x}{\cos 3x} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} + 1},$$ $$\Rightarrow \tan 3x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} + 1}.$$ To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate $(\sqrt{2} - 1)$ : $$\tan 3x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} + 1} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2} - 1}{\sqrt{2} - 1},$$ $$\Rightarrow \tan 3x = \sqrt{2} - 1.$$ That's the process of doing it by hand.

51,Why does the trick to remember the trigonometric table work?,Why does the trick to remember the trigonometric table work?,,"When I was first introduced to trigonometric ratios, I learned the following trick to remember the trigonometric table of standard angles ( $0^{\circ}$ , $30^{\circ}$ , $45^{\circ}$ , $60^{\circ}$ , $90^{\circ}$ ): Sine: Take the numbers $0$ , $1$ , $2$ , $3$ , $4$ for each angle $0^\circ$ , $30^\circ$ , $45^\circ$ , $60^\circ$ , $90^\circ$ . Divide each number by $4$ and take the square root of the result. This will give the $\sin$ ratio of each corresponding angle. Tangent: Take the numbers $0$ , $1$ , $3$ , $9$ for each angle $0^\circ$ , $30^\circ$ , $45^\circ$ , $60^\circ$ . Divide each number by $3$ and take the square root of the quotient. This will give the $\tan$ ratio of each corresponding angle. (Note that $\tan90^\circ$ is undefined) For example if we want to find the value of $\sin60^\circ$ , we divide $3$ by $4$ and take the square root of $\frac34$ . Then we get the result $\frac{\sqrt3}{2}$ which is indeed the value of $\sin60^\circ$ . This two tricks allow to remember the whole trigonometric table using the relation of $\sin$ and $\tan$ with other trigonometric ratios. I think the trick is well-known. My question is that why do these tricks work ? Are they kind of coincidence (which is highly unlikely)? I can prove the trigonometric ratios individually.

I derived it in the following way: Using Euler's formulas, we can write $\cos^n(x)$ out as: $$\cos^n(x)=\frac{1}{2^n}(e^{ix}+e^{-ix})^n$$ Which, when expanded using Newton's binomial formula yields: $$\cos^n(x)=\frac{1}{2^n}\sum_{k=0}^n\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}e^{ikx}\cdot e^{-ix(n-k)}$$ Which simplifies down to: $$\cos^n(x)=\frac{1}{2^n}\left(\sum_{k=0}^n(\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\cos(x(2k-n)))+i\sum_{k=0}^n(\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\sin(x(2k-n)))\right)$$ $$=\frac{1}{2^n}C_n+\frac{i}{2^n}S_n$$ Because $S_n\in\mathbb{R}$ we can write that $\Im(\cos^n(x))=S_n=0$ And consequently we yield: $$\cos^n(x)=\frac{1}{2^n}\sum_{k=0}^n\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\cos(x(2k-n))$$ Where does this originally come from?

87,Seeking a practical layperson's explanation of the math behind spoke length selection for wheelbuilding,Seeking a practical layperson's explanation of the math behind spoke length selection for wheelbuilding,,"I build bicycle wheels for a living. I am exceptionally frustrated with the quality and consistency of the calculation tools available for spoke lengths. For those of you who don’t build wheels, let me mention that the spoke length needs to be accurate within a millimeter, (less than 1/3 of one percent). Otherwise you run the risk of spokes which are too long (pops your tire) or too short (unsightly and creates a weak wheel). Compounding the task, manufacturing tolerances of rims, spokes, and hubs vary and they stretch and deform during building. With such a moving target, a tiny error in length calculation can become a time consuming failure. Here is the basic mathematical formula for spoke length determination: $$ l = \sqrt {a^2+r{_1}^2+r{_2}^2-2r_1r_2 cos(\alpha)}$$ Where: a = distance from the central point of the hub to the hub flange, for example 30 mm. This is the base of the triangle that defines the length of the spoke in a radial pattern or zero cross pattern. r1 = spoke hole circle radius of the hub. This is the radius of the circle defined by the center of the spoke holes in the hub flange. r2 = nipple seat radius, equal to half the ERD of the rim. (ERD is effective rim diameter. It is the circle defined by the point where the spoken nipple contacts the rim. It is effectively the endpoint of the spoke on the rim end.) m = number of spokes to be used for one side of the wheel, for example 36/2=18 (Wheels are typically built with 24, 28, 32, or 40 total spokes, with half that number being used for each side of the wheel) k = number of crossings per spoke (This number is difficult to explain, but will be either zero, one, two or three. 95% of my wheels are 3X, with the remainder being 2X.  It refers to the number of times in a given spoke crosses over or under other spokes in the wheel. More crossings equal a stronger wheel because there is more crossbracing between spokes. More in-depth explanation here ) α = 360° k/m For most bicycle wheel builders, this is an intimidating formula. I would like to see a practical demonstration of this formula in use. For a given hub and rim combination, how do I calculate spoke length using this formula? An example data set would be: A Rohloff Speedhub 500/14 is a fairly simple hub. It is a symmetrical pattern hub. Both hub flanges have a circle diameter of 100mm $(r^1)$ . The manufacturer specifies a two cross lacing $(k)$ on this hub. The center to flange distance on both sides of the hub is also symmetrical, with a distance of 29mm $(a)$ from the center to each flange. This particular hub and rim are drilled for 36 spokes $(m)$ . An ERD of 594mm $(r^2)$ for a Sun Ringle MTX33 rim completes the necessary data. As I recently built this wheel, I know that it requires a spoke length of 260mm. However, given only this information, this formula, and a pencil and paper, I would not be able to calculate the correct spoke length.

89,Cosine related to Bitwise XOR through Repeated Roots,Cosine related to Bitwise XOR through Repeated Roots,,"I have been doing a lot of calculations involving cosine and have noticed a pattern. I spent some time and developed this algorithm for calculating cosines. To calculate the $\cos(x)$ where $x$ is in radians: Sanitize the input so that $x$ is $[0,2\pi)$ : $x_1 \gets (|x| \mod 2\pi )$ Divide by $\pi$ . This is usually fairly trivial as radians are often expressed as multiples of $\pi$ . $x_2 \gets x_1/\pi$ This is where things get interesting. Use the bitwise XOR operation: $x_3 \gets x_2 \veebar 2x_2$ Here we are going to express $x_3$ in binary and map its bits to signs in a repeated root of 2, which will then be assigned to $x_4$ . This is easier to illustrate with an example rather than with a formula: Finally, divide by 2: $x_5 \gets x_4/2$ This will result in the $\cos(x)$ , i.e. $\cos(x) = x_5$ .

Before asking the question one needs to explain some facts about this infinite product. Consider these two propositions If $\cos\frac{\pi j}{n+1}+\cosh\alpha_j= \cos\frac{\pi k}{m+1}+\cosh\beta_k=x$ for all integers $1\le j\le n,\ 1\le k\le m$ then $$ \prod_{j=1}^n\frac{\sinh(m+1)\alpha_j}{\sinh\alpha_j}=\prod_{k=1}^m\frac{\sinh(n+1)\beta_k}{\sinh\beta_k},\tag{1} $$ If $\cos\frac{\pi (j-\frac{1}{2})}{n}+\cosh\alpha_j= \cos\frac{\pi (k-\frac{1}{2})}{m}+\cosh\beta_k=x$ for all integers $1\le j\le n,\ 1\le k\le m$ then $$ \prod_{j=1}^n2\cosh m\alpha_j=\prod_{k=1}^m2\cosh n\beta_k.\tag{2} $$ The formulas defining $\alpha_j$ and $\beta_k$ arise during solution of Helmholtz equation on a finite rectangular lattice with suitable boundary conditions (see e.g. Phillips, B.; Wiener, N.
