What does a topology induced by a metric mean?,\text{i}) \text{ii}),"I am now trying to understand what a topology and a topological space is. Yes, I know the ""formal"" or ""mathematical definition"" of it, it is in my notes so it's easy for me to reiterate that. Please bear with me as I am trying my best to express my confusion, it's a little hard to even do that in words. Here's the definition I am sticking to $X$ is a set. A topology on X is a set of subsets $\tau$ of $X$ with the following properties Whenever $(U_{i})_{i \in I}$ is a family(finite or not) of subsets of $X$ such that $U_i \in \tau$ , $\forall i \in I$ then $\cup_{i \in I}U_i \in \tau$ Whenever $U_1$ , $U_2 \in \tau$ then $U_1 \cap U_2 \in \tau$ . $\phi \in \tau$ and $X \in \tau$ $i$ ) So my problem is,for each 1,2,3 conditions, I understand what they mean. So each subset in $\tau$ satisfies 1,2,3, which as a whole, is some subset of $X$ and we'll just name it ""a topology"" on $X$ ...yes? My issue is, I don't see what this ""collectively"" gives. So if you are to explain it to someone who does not really do math, and explain it casually, what would you say? what does this ""set of subsets"" give? Is it nothing more than ""just the set of subsets that satisfy 1,2,3, end of story""? That is probably one of the reason why I cannot find a topology for any specific given set. I just don't know how. $ii$ ) And also, the notion of induced topology by a metric is unclear to me. The ""discrete topology"" as I hear very often, is apparently one of the most common topology which is induced by the discrete metric. In my notes, it says The discrete topology of $X$ is the collection of all subsets of $X$ , which is the largest possible topology on $X$ . So, if I take a set of positive integers $X=\mathbb{Z}^+$ then the discrete topology is $\{\mathbb{Z}^+, \phi,\{1\},\{2\},\{3\},...,\{1,2\},\{1,3\},...,\{2,3\},\{2,4\},...,\{1,2,3\},\{1,2,4\},...\}$ ? But even if it is, how is this ""induced by the discrete metric? How is it relevant?

And yes, I ""know"" it's $(X, \tau)$ where $\tau$ is a topology on $X$ but again, I can't help but confuse when I think of ""metric spaces"" Metric space so far makes a lot more sense to me. I see $d(x,y)$ , a metric as a function, so when we say a metric space $(X,d)$ just as how we phrase $(X,\tau)$ ,I understand it as a set $X$ with some function $d(x,y)$ which can be ""applied"" to the elements of $X$ to ""give a value"", which is the ""distance."" So it's a set $X$ where I have given a ""method"" to tell how far any 2 elements are in it. Now, $(X, \tau)$ doesn't sink in to me because $\tau$ , unlike $d(x,y)$ doesn't do anything to $X$ (does it?). Meaning, it's just a set in a sense(with some special features) but does not allow me to ""pick some value in $X$ "" to give me ""some value""(whatever it is).

The theorem says Let $M$ be a differentiable manifold and $\{U_\alpha: \alpha \in A \}$ an open cover of $M$ . Then there exists a countable partition of unity $\{ \varphi_i : i = 1, 2, 3, \dotsc \}$ subordinate to the cover $\{U_\alpha\}$ with $\operatorname{supp}\varphi_i$ compact for each $i$ . If one does not require compact supports, then there is a partition of unity $\{\varphi_\alpha \}$ subordinate to the cover $\{U_\alpha \}$ (that is, $\operatorname{supp} \varphi_\alpha \subset U_\alpha$ ) with at most countably many of the $\varphi_\alpha$ not identically zero.

Is that right, or way off base? Finally, the last sentence. I can't imagine how just picking K up off of X shows that it is a deformation retract of the entire knot complement.

The best I can tell from the diagram is that the square ""$S_l$"" is really just a piece cut out of $R_i$ with the two bottom (i.e., table-intersecting) edges that touch $R_j$ and $R_k$ identified with the bottom pieces of those strips at the ends where they meet it. Is that right, or way off base? Finally, the last sentence. I can't imagine how just picking K up off of X shows that it is a deformation retract of the entire knot complement. I don't think a more detailed explanation of this is actually necessary for proving the Wirtinger presentation of the fundamental group, since the problem basically allows me to assume this is true and it isn't actually one of the steps for ""constructing"" X, but I'd still like to have some understanding of it. Any help with seeing what this retraction looks like would be appreciated.",,"['general-topology', 'algebraic-topology', 'knot-theory']"

33,Is there a countably compact sequential non-$T_2$ space that is not sequentially compact?,Is there a countably compact sequential non- space that is not sequentially compact?,T_2,"Let $X$ be a topological space. Definitions: $X$ is countably compact if every countable open cover of $X$ has a finite subcover or equivalently, every sequence in $X$ has a cluster point. $X$ is sequentially compact if every sequence in $X$ has a convergent subsequence $X$ is sequential if every sequentially closed set is closed. It is known that if $X$ is countably compact + sequential + $T_2$ then $X$ is sequentially compact (see e.g. Engelking). The proof goes like this: Let $x_n$ be a sequence in $X$. Since $X$ is countably compact $x_n$ has a cluster point $x \in X$. If $\{ n \mid x_n = x \}$ is infinite then we have a constant subsequence of $x_n$, thus convergent. So assume that $\{ n \mid x_n = x \}$ is finite such that there is some $n_0$ and $x_n \neq x$ for all $n \geq n_0$. Consider the set $A := \{ x_n \mid n \geq n_0 \} \setminus \{ x \}$. Then $A$ is not closed and since $X$ is sequential, $A$ is not sequentially closed. Thus, there is a sequence $y_k \in A$ and $y \in X \setminus A$ such that $y_k \to y$. Since $X$ is $T_2$ it follows that $y_k$ is not eventually constant since otherwise $y_k \to y_N \in A$ for some $N \in \mathbb{N}$ and $y_k \to y \in X \setminus A$ implies $y_N = y$ which is a contradiction. Thus, we have infinitely many $y_k$ in $A$ which can be finally used to construct a convergent subsequence of $x_n$. There are also other properties $\varphi$ such that countable compactness + $\varphi$ imply sequential compactness. As an example, $\varphi$ can be taken to be first-countable or even Fréchet-Urysohn (cluster points of injective sequences $x_n$ are accumulation points of the corresponding sets $x(\mathbb{N})$, thus lying in the closure and thus being able to be approximated by a sequence in $x(\mathbb{N})$ which can be used to generate a convergent subsequence of $x_n$). There is no need for an additional separation property. In my eyes, the Fréchet-Urysohn property is not ""too far"" away from the sequential property and thus it is a little bit ""strange"" that sequentialness needs an additional separation property. By ""too far"" I mean that typical spaces that are sequential but not Fréchet-Urysohn are a little bit pathological (e.g. Arens-Fort space). Questions: Is there some deeper insight, why we need a separation property for sequentialness but not for Fréchet-Urysohn? Is the separation property really needed, i.e. is there some sequential space which is countably compact but not sequentially compact? Remark: In fact, for the uniqueness of the sequential limit we can reduce the $T_2$ separation property to the $US$ separation property (i.e. $X$ is sequentially Hausdorff) which lies strictly between $T_1$ and $T_2$.

The first problem can be solved by supposing $x\in \overline B(0,1)$, noting that in lowest terms $x = a/b$ with $p\nmid b$, and then showing that the terms $$ a, a-b, a-2b, \ldots, a-(p-1)b $$ are all unequal modulo $p$. The second problem can be solved simply by noting that the $p-$adic absolute value can only take values of the form $p^n$, $n\in\mathbb Z$, and thus there are no elements of $\mathbb Q_p$ with absolute values strictly between $1/p$ and $1$.

Write $x-x_0$ in lowest terms as $a/b$ and suppose that the $p-$adic valuation $v_p(a/b)\geq 0$, so that $p\nmid b$. Now consider the $p$ terms $$ a, a-b, a-2b, \ldots, a-(p-1)b. $$ If any pair of these were congruent modulo $p$, then we would have their difference being divisible by $p$, so $p|(kb)$ where $0 < k < p$, and then $p|b$, a contradiction. Thus, $p$ divides precisely one of these terms, $a - jb$. Then $v_p(\frac{a-jb}{b}) > 0$, so $|\frac{a-jb}{b}| < 1$, that is, $|\frac{a}{b} - j| < 1$, so $x-x_0 = a/b \in B(j,1)$. However, I think I'm supposed to end up with $x$ being in some sort of open ball, rather than $x-x_0$ being in the open ball, so I'm stuck. I am intending to look at the case of $v_p(a/b) < 0$ separately, once I get past this point. For the second part, I know that given $B(x_0,\varepsilon)$, if I let $n$ be the largest integer strictly less than $\log_p \varepsilon$, then $\overline B(x_0, p^n) = B(x_0,\varepsilon)$, and then since every closed ball is the disjoint union of open balls from the preceding part, I am done.","I'm reading the Foundations chapter of Gouvea's p-adic Numbers: An Introduction , and I'm trying to solve the following problem he poses to the reader: Take the $p-$adic absolute value on $\mathbb Q$.

Thus, $p$ divides precisely one of these terms, $a - jb$. Then $v_p(\frac{a-jb}{b}) > 0$, so $|\frac{a-jb}{b}| < 1$, that is, $|\frac{a}{b} - j| < 1$, so $x-x_0 = a/b \in B(j,1)$. However, I think I'm supposed to end up with $x$ being in some sort of open ball, rather than $x-x_0$ being in the open ball, so I'm stuck. I am intending to look at the case of $v_p(a/b) < 0$ separately, once I get past this point. For the second part, I know that given $B(x_0,\varepsilon)$, if I let $n$ be the largest integer strictly less than $\log_p \varepsilon$, then $\overline B(x_0, p^n) = B(x_0,\varepsilon)$, and then since every closed ball is the disjoint union of open balls from the preceding part, I am done.",,"['general-topology', 'metric-spaces', 'p-adic-number-theory']"
