I have a solution, but I'm not sure if it's right, because it seems overly complex. Could someone check my solution please? We know that $\frac{a\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}+b}{c\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}+d} = x$ for all real numbers $x$ . However, this equality will only hold under 2 conditions: $cx+d \ne 0$ for all real $x$ , because if $cx+d = 0$ , we would have an indeterminate form within the equation. $(ca + cd)x + cb + d^2 \ne 0$ for all real $x$ , for the same reason as above. To ensure the above holds for all $x$ , we must ensure that the $x$ such that each expression $= 0$ is not equal to a real number. Hence: $cx+d=0$ $x=-d/c$ So $c=0$ to prevent $x$ from being a real number, and $d \ne 0$ , to ensure the above expression never equals to $0$ . Hence: $(ca + cd)x + cb + d^2 = 0$ By the same reasoning, $ca + cd=0$ and $cb + d^2 \ne 0$ . Given this, we can rearrange the above to form the quadratic: $(ca+cd)x^2 + (d^2 - a^2)x + ba + bd = 0$ .

11,How do inverse functions exist for exponential functions?,How do inverse functions exist for exponential functions?,,"I know that they exist for exponential functions (we currently have them in class), but to me it doesn't seem ""reasonable"" when I look at the definition of what an inverse function is. The inverse is defined as a function where you can swap $x$ and $y$ , then solve for $y$ and the notation being $\operatorname{f^{-1}}(x)$ . Since functions are a 1 to 1 mapping this can only be true for some functions. In the textbook we use we have following definition for the domain of functions/inverse functions: $$\mathbb{D}_{f} = \mathbb{W}_{f^{-1}} \rightleftharpoons \mathbb{W}_{f} = \mathbb{D}_{f^{-1}}$$ I also get that some functions don't have inverses or where they only exist for a restricted domain (like $x^2$ where you have to restrict the domain, or some functions where you can't solve for $x$ ). The thing about as example $2^x$ that puts me off is that the input domain $\mathbb{D}$ consists out of all real numbers, whereas the output is made out of positive real numbers only. How can there be a 1 to 1 mapping if the output consists only out of positive real numbers, aren't there less positive real numbers than real numbers? With as example $x^3$ you use up all $x$ and $y$ values, so it having a valid inverse makes intuitive sense to me. We get taught about how important the uniqueness of the mapping between $x$ and $y$ is, but it just feels wrong for exponential functions. Can anyone provide me a pointer to as where I start thinking about this wrongly? I have solved all the problems in our book and on the additional sheet the teacher gave us and have only had a few mistakes (which probably came from lack of sleep). Understanding the composition of functions was pretty easy for me as well, thanks to knowing higher order functions. I'm really sure I'm misunderstanding something elementary the wrong way.","I know that they exist for exponential functions (we currently have them in class), but to me it doesn't seem ""reasonable"" when I look at the definition of what an inverse function is.

30,Reduce number of arguments by linear combinations,Reduce number of arguments by linear combinations,,"Given a nonlinear function $f : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ . My goal is to reduce the number of arguments that this function takes using only linear combinations of its original arguments. Let $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ be the original arguments and $$ \tilde{x} = A x $$ the ""reduced"" arguments $\tilde{x} \in \mathbb{R}^m$ with $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ and $m \leq n$ . So the task is then to find $A$ and $g : \mathbb{R}^m \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that $g(\tilde{x}) = f(x) \, \forall x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and that $m$ is as small as possible. Example 1 : Take $f : \mathbb{R}^4 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ with $$ f(x) = (x_1 + x_2)^2 + (x_3 - x_4)^2 $$ It is now easy to choose a linear combination to reduce the number of arguments of $f$ by $$ \tilde{x} = \begin{bmatrix} \tilde{x}_1 \newline \tilde{x}_2 \end{bmatrix} = A x =  \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \newline 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \newline x_2 \newline x_3 \newline x_4 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 + x_2 \newline x_3 - x_4 \end{bmatrix} $$ So we can rewrite $f$ as the function $g : \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ in terms of the new arguments as $$ g(\tilde{x}) = \tilde{x}_1^2 + \tilde{x}_2^2 $$ Now $g$ is a function of only 2 arguments, so $m < n$ because $2 < 4$ . I  assume that this is also the smallest $m$ possible here. Example 2 : Take $f : \mathbb{R}^4 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ with $$ f(x) = x_1 x_2 x_3 x_4 $$ Here, I see no possiblity to reduce the number of arguments somehow using the described technique. So I would assume that here, the smallest possible $m = n = 4$ . Questions : Three questions basically. Is there a way to always find the smallest $m$ , the related $A$ matrix and $g$ function? If not, a way to find some $m < n$ , if it exists, the related $A$ matrix and $g$ function? Is this a known (or related to a known) problem? If yes, references are appreciated.

31,If a function is one-to-one but not onto does it have an infinite number of left inverses?,If a function is one-to-one but not onto does it have an infinite number of left inverses?,,"The question I have asks to show that if a function $f: A \rightarrow A$ is one-to-one but not onto, it has at least two left inverses. I've worked out what I consider to be a solution, but what I found differs slightly from what the question is asking. First note that since the function maps $A$ to itself and it is one-to-one but not onto, one can assume that A is not a finite set. Next, let $i,j \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $x_i \in A$ be a fixed element in A such that if $i \neq j$ then $x_i \neq x_j$ . Now, let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and define $g_n: A \rightarrow A$ as follows: Let $a,b \in A$ . If $f(a)=b$ then let $g_n(b)=a$ . Note that this is well defined since $f$ is one-to-one. If for $b \in A$ , $\nexists a \in A$ such that $f(a)=b$ , let $g_n(b)=x_n$ This function is a valid left inverse $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$ since if $f(a)=b$ , we have that $g_n(f(a))=g_n(b)=a$ . Since $f$ is onto, there must be at least one $b$ that satisfies the second rule. Also, since $A$ must be an infinite set, $x_n$ must be defined $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$ . This means that $g_n$ must also be defined $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$ , so there is an infinite number of left inverses. I understand that an infinite number of inverses is still technically at least two inverses, but this wording has led me to think I've gotten something wrong here, and if there are any mistakes in my argument it would be fantastic if someone could point them out. Thanks. EDIT This is what I handed in, of which I got full marks: Let $A$ be a set such that $A \neq \emptyset$ and let $f \in F_A$ be a function, that is $f: A \rightarrow A$ . Suppose $f$ is injective but not surjective. Note that this means that $A$ must be infinite set. Next, let $i,j \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $x_i \in A$ be a fixed element in A such that if $i \neq j$ then $x_i \neq x_j$ . Now, let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and define the family of functions $g_n: A \rightarrow A$ as follows: If for $b \in A$ , $\exists a \in A$ such that $f(a)=b$ then let $g_n(b)=a$ . Note that this is well defined since $f$ is injective, so $a$ will always be unique. If for $b \in A$ , $\nexists a \in A$ such that $f(a)=b$ , then let $g_n(b)=x_n$ . Now, let $a,b \in A$ such that $f(a)=b$ . By rule i. for $g_n$ , we have that $g_n(b)=a$ , so $g_n \circ f(a)=g(f(a))=g(b)=a=\iota (a)$ . Since $g_n \circ f=\iota$ , $g_n$ is a left inverse of $f$ , regardless of the value of $n$ since we did not use rule ii. of the definition of $g_n$ . As we noted before, $A$ must be an infinite set, so $x_n$ must be defined $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$ , hence $g_n$ must also be defined $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$ . Lastly, we will show that no two left inverses by this definition can be equal, because if $g_1=g_2=g_3=\ldots$ then there would only be one left inverse.. Let $i,j \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $i \neq j$ and let $b \in A$ such that $\nexists a \in A$ where $f(a)=b$ , which is possible since $f$ is not surjective. By rule ii. for $g_n$ , $g_i(b)=x_i$ and $g_j(b)=x_j$ . Since $i \neq j$ , then $x_i \neq x_j$ , hence $g_i \neq g_j$ . $\therefore$ Since $f$ has an infinite number of left inverses in $F_A$ , $f$ has at least two different left inverses $F_A$ .","The question I have asks to show that if a function is one-to-one but not onto, it has at least two left inverses.

Then there will exist a composite function $g(x) = (\tau_{y_0, y}\circ f)(x) = y$ where the $\tau$ notation is a transposition of elements and is bijective, so then there must exist some $g(x) = y$ Am I going about the proof in the wrong way, or is this OK?","While self-teaching bijective mappings I came across the following question:  Given that the bijective mapping $f : X \mapsto Y$ exists and $x$ and $y$ are elements of $X$ and $Y$ respectively, prove that there exists a bijection $g : X \mapsto Y$ such that $g(x)=y$.

97,Complex inverse function,Complex inverse function,,I've got a problem when solving an inverse function. Usually when I have a basic function and trying to find its inverse is not a problem. I just solve for X and find it. But now I've got a more complicated one and I don't know how to start. If the inverse function is $$f^{-1}(x+2) = \frac{3x-2}{2x+3}$$ I have to find $$f\left( \frac{1}{x-4} \right).$$ I really don't know where to start. I would know to solve it if it was simple as just f(x) but this is more complex. If someone could show me step by step it would really help me.
