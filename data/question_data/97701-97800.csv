Question is, to verify whether the above set is a region? So i tried to plot the graph of the above set, to get idea of the set. First i tried converting to, cartesian coordinates, it became, $(x^2+y^2)^2<2(x^2-y^2)$ . But for me,this seemed no good. Using polar coordinate, the inequality transformed to, $r^2< 2\cos(2θ)$ , it looks a lot simpler now. Now , i don't know how to plot such  graphs, in polar coordinates.","is a complex number, .

The Laurent series have been introduced as: Laurent series $$ \begin{array}{l} f(z)=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} a_{n}\left(z-z_{0}\right)^{n} \\ a_{n}=\frac{1}{2 \pi i} \oint_{C} \frac{f\left(z^{\prime}\right) d z^{\prime}}{\left(z^{\prime}-z_{0}\right)^{n+1}} \end{array} $$ However, I noticed that the above integral isn't used in the solutions to any of the problems regarding laurent series. So I'm trying to understand why we can avoid using it. What I understood so far, is that the difference between the Taylor and Laurent series, is that the Laurent series also contains negative powers. Where it's not possible to expand a Taylor series around a point $z_0$ where f is not analytically, the opposite applies for the Laurent series. In the case we expand f around a point where f is analytically, the Laurent series and Taylor expansion will be the same. If that is the correct understanding, please help me understand the solution to the following problem: Find the Laurent series for $f(z)=(1-z)e^{1/z}$ about $z=0$ What I thought should be my approach is using the formula above solving the contour integral, since $f(z)$ is non-analytically at $z=0$ . However, the solution uses directly that $e^{1/z}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{z^{-n}}{n !}$ . So here comes my first question: Why is the Laurent series of $e^{1/z}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{z^{-n}}{n !}$ . It seems to me, that they have just substituted $z \rightarrow 1/z$ in the Taylor series for $e^z$ . But $e^{1/z}$ is not analytic at $z=0$ , so the Taylor expansion around that point shouldn't exist? And if that is not the Taylor series, how do we know it's the Laurent series? After this they multiply the two expressions together: $(z-1) e^{1 / z}=(z-1) \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{z^{-n}}{n !}=z-\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(\frac{n}{n+1}\right) \frac{z^{-n}}{n !}$ Is that because $z-1$ is a polynomial and thus is analytically around $z=0$ and is it's own Taylor series and Laurent series. So we can just find the Laurent series of each factor and multiply them together to find the final Laurent series? Fx: Consider $h(z)=f(z)g(z)$ , if we want to find the Laurent series around $z=z_0$ . If the Laurent series of f(z) around $z_0$ is $\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} a_{n}\left(z-z_{0}\right)^{n}$ and of $g(z)$ is $\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} b_{n}\left(z-z_{0}\right)^{n}$ . Is the Laurent series of $h(z)$ then: $h(z)=(\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} a_{n}\left(z-z_{0}\right)^{n}) (\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} b_{n}\left(z-z_{0}\right)^{n})$ ?","I'm currently taking a course in mathemathical tools, where we are covering complex analysis (Note that this course is not very rigorous and we cover complex analysis in only 4 lectures).

44,Why $a_{-1}$ term of Laurent series may not be residue?,Why  term of Laurent series may not be residue?,a_{-1},"Suppose $f(z)$ is analytic on $0<|z-z_0|<R$ . And we find a Laurent's series for $f(z)$ on annulus $r<|z-z_0|<R$ where $r$ may not be $0$ . Then it is said that $a_{-1}$ of such Laurent's series may not be residue unless $r=0$ (Residue is defined as $Res(f,z_0)=\frac{1}{2 \pi i}\int_\gamma f(z)dz$ for any enclosed curve $\gamma$ on $0<|z-z_0|<R$ ). I find this hard to understand. In particular, fix an enclosed curve $\gamma'$ contained in $r<|z-z_0|<R$ where the Laurent's series applies. Substitute $f$ with this Laurent series into $Res(f,z_0)=\frac{1}{2 \pi i}\int_{\gamma'} f(z)dz$ . Then integral of all except the $a_{-1}/(z-z_0)$ terms should evaluate to $0$ as we have finished substitution and are just evaluating the integral with Cauchy formula (and thus are no longer concerned by where Laurent's series apply). In the end since $Res(f,z_0)=\frac{1}{2 \pi i}\int_\gamma f(z)dz$ takes same value for all $\gamma$ in $0<|z-z_0|<R$ , our result based on $\gamma'$ applies in general. Where is the mistake in this proof? Note 1.  I have checked explicit expression for $a_{-1}$ in a Laurent expansion where $r>0$ .  I think $a_{-1}$ should be residue. The statement in Note 2 may be false. I hope the author or somebody with expertise in complex analysis could confirm. Note 2. The original statement I was referring to can be found in Simon's answer in this post: Calculate residue at essential singularity : ""In fact the residue of $f(z)$ at an isolated singularity $z_0$ of $f$ is defined as the coefficient of the $(z-z_0)^{-1}$ term in the Laurent Series expansion of $f(z)$ in an annulus of the form $0 < |z-z_0|<R$ for some $R > 0$ or $R = \infty$ .

So we only need to evaluate the residues $$\oint\limits_C f(z)dz = 2\pi i \sum \text{Res}\big(f(z)\big)\,.$$ The poles are $\pm i$ and of second order. Here is our chosen contour . Let us recall the residue of an $m$-th order of pole is $$\text{Res}[f(z);z_0]=\frac{1}{(m-1)!}\lim_{z\to z_0} \frac{\text{d}^{m-1}}{\text{d}z^{m-1}}\,(z-z_0)^m\,f(z)\,.$$ Consequently the residues are $$\text{Res}[f(z);i]=\lim_{z \to i}\Bigg(\frac{2\ln z}{z(z+i)^2}-\frac{2\ln^2 z}{(z+i)^3}\Bigg)=\frac{2\cdot \left(\frac{i\pi}{2}\right)}{-4i}-\frac{2\cdot (-\frac{\pi^2}{4})}{-8i}=-\frac{\pi}{4}+i\frac{\pi^2}{16}$$ As for the other pole $$\text{Res}[f(z);-i]=\lim_{z \to -i}\Bigg(\frac{2\ln z}{z(z-i)^2}-\frac{2\ln^2 z}{(z-i)^3}\Bigg)=\frac{2\cdot \left(\frac{i3\pi}{2}\right)}{4i}-\frac{2\cdot \left(-\frac{9\pi^2}{4}\right)}{8i}=\frac{3\pi}{4}-i\frac{9\pi^2}{16}\,.$$ Adding these two together and remembering the residue theorem, we have $$\oint\limits_C f(z)\,\text{d}z = 2\pi i \cdot \left(\frac{\pi}{2}-i\frac{\pi^2}{2}\right)=i\pi^2+\pi^3$$ On the other hand, for the integrals over $C_+$ and $C_-$, $z=x$ and $z=xe^{2\pi i}$ respectively.
