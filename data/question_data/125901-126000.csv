4,Perfect semi direct products,Perfect semi direct products,,"Let $ \pi,V $ be a representation of a perfect group $ G $ . I'm interested in sufficient conditions for a semi direct product like $ V \rtimes_\pi G $ to be perfect. Requiring that $ \pi $ is faithful and or irreducible isn't enough because of trivial counterexamples using abelian groups. I'm especially interested in the condition that $ \pi $ is fixed point free (the only vector $ v $ fixed by all of $ G $ is the zero vector). Is that sufficient for $ V \rtimes_\pi G $ to be perfect? Motivation: Let $ V $ be the $ n-1 $ dimensional vector space of length $ n$ binary vectors whose entries sum to 0. There is a natural permutation representation $ \pi $ of the alternating group $ A_n $ on $ V $ . This representation is fixed point free, in fact it acts transitively on the nonzero vectors.

If you have some totally different sufficient condition for a semi direct product to be perfect feel free to share, these are just some thoughts. And more generally I'm interested in any condition on a (possibly non split) extension of a perfect group $ G $ $$ 1 \to V \to E \to G \to 1 $$ Which is sufficient to imply that $ E $ is perfect. EDIT: Really nice sufficient condition from Derek Holt: Let $$ 1 \to V \to E \to G \to 1 $$ be a SES with $ V $ abelian and $ G $ perfect. Then if $ V $ is a (nontrivial) irreducible $ G $ module then $ E $ must be perfect. The statement for semi direct products is just the special case when the sequence splits.

11,Dixmier's lemma as a generalisation of Schur's first lemma,Dixmier's lemma as a generalisation of Schur's first lemma,,"What mathematicians call Schur's lemma is known to physicists as Schur's second lemma : An intertwiner of two irreducible representations of a group is either zero or isomorphism. It is valid for all dimensionalities -- finite, countable,    uncountable. The following statement is referred to in physics books as Schur's first lemma : An intertwiner from an irreducible representation to itself is a scalar times the identity operator. In finite dimensions, the latter lemma easily follows from the former one: Let $\,{\mathbb{A}}\,$ be the said irreducible representation, with an element $\,g\,$ of the group $\,G\,$ mapped to an operator $\,{\mathbb{A}}_g\,$ . If $\,{\mathbb{M}}\,$ is an intertwiner, i.e., if $~{\mathbb{M}}\,{\mathbb{A}}_g\,=\,{\mathbb{A}}_g\,{\mathbb{M}}~$ for $\,\forall\, g\in G\,$ , then $~({\mathbb{M}}\,-\,\lambda\,{\mathbb{I}})\,{\mathbb{A}}_g\,=\,{\mathbb{A}}_g\,({\mathbb{M}}\,-\,\lambda\,{\mathbb{I}})\,$ , where $\,\lambda\,$ is any eigenvalue of $\,{\mathbb{M}}\,$ , while $\,{\mathbb{I}}\,$ is the identity matrix. Schur's Second Lemma says that the matrix $\,({\mathbb{M}}\,-\,\lambda\,{\mathbb{I}})\,$ is either zero or nonsingular. The latter option, however, is excluded because the eigenvector corresponding to $\,\lambda\,$ is mapped by the operator $~({\mathbb{M}}\,-\,\lambda\,{\mathbb{I}})\,{\mathbb{A}}_g\,$ to zero. So this is a zero operator, and $\,{\mathbb{M}}\,=\,\lambda\,{\mathbb{I}}\,$ . $\left.\qquad\right.$ ${\mathbb{QED}}$ This proof works only for finite dimensions, because it requires a nonzero $\,{\mathbb{M}}\,$ to possess at least one nonzero eigenvalue. A generalisation of Schur's first lemma to countable dimensions is Dixmier's lemma . I present its formulation for group representations, because this is the language understandable to a physicist. Suppose that $\,V\,$ is a countable-dimension vector space over $\,{\mathbb{C}}\,$ and that $\,{\mathbb{A}}\,$ is a group representation acting irreducibly on $\,V\,$ . If the intertwiner $\,{\mathbb{M}}\in\,$ Hom $\,_C(V, V )\,$ commutes with the action of $\,{\mathbb{A}}\,$ , then there exists a number $\,c\in{\mathbb{C}}\,$ for  which $\,{\mathbb{M}}\,-\,c\,{\mathbb{I}}\,$ is not invertible on the space $\,V\,$ . Proof To employ reductio ad absurdum , start with an assumption that the map $\,{\mathbb{M}}\,-\,c\,{\mathbb{I}}\,$ is invertible for $\,\forall c\in {\mathbb{C}}\,$ .  Then, for any non-zero polynomial $$\,P(x)\,=\,(x-p_1)\,(x-p_2)\,.\,.\,.\,(x-p_N)\,\;,$$ invertible is the map $$\,P({\mathbb{M}})\,=\,({\mathbb{M}}\,-\,p_1\,{\mathbb{I}})\,({\mathbb{M}}\,-\,p_2\,{\mathbb{I}})\,.\,.\,.\,({\mathbb{M}}\,-\,p_N\,{\mathbb{I}})\,\;,$$ because the composition of invertible maps is invertible. Consider all rational functions $\,R(x)\,=\,P(x)/Q(x)\,$ , with $\,P(x)\,$ and $\,Q(x)\,$ complex-valued polynomials in a complex variable $\,x\,$ .  Defined on $\,{\mathbb{C}}\,$ except an unspecified finite subset (allowed to vary with each function), they constitute a space $\,{\mathbb{C}}(x)\,$ over $\,{\mathbb{C}}\,$ . While the space $\,{\mathbb{C}}[x]\,$ of polynomials is of countable dimensions over $\,{\mathbb{C}}\,$ , the space $\,{\mathbb{C}}(x)\,$ of rational functions is of uncountable dimensions. For any $\,R(x)\,=\,P(x)/Q(x)\,$ , there exists a map $\,R({\mathbb{M}})\,=\,P({\mathbb{M}})/Q({\mathbb{M}})\,$ .   Hence a map $$  {\mathbb{C}}(x)\,\longrightarrow\,\mbox{Hom}_C\,(V,\,V)\,\;.  $$ As we saw above, our initial assumption that the map $\,{\mathbb{M}}\,-\,c\,{\mathbb{I}}\,$ is invertible for $\,\forall c\in {\mathbb{C}}\,$ implies that all nonzero polynomials in $\,{\mathbb{M}}\,$ are invertible. For an invertible polynomial $\,Q({\mathbb{M}})\,$ , invertible is the map $\,1/Q({\mathbb{M}})\,$ . So the maps $\,R({\mathbb{M}})\,=\,\left(\,Q({\mathbb{M}})\,\right)^{-1}\,P({\mathbb{M}})\,$ are compositions of invertible transformations, and thus are invertible. Stated alternatively, if $\,v\in V\,$ is non-zero, then $\,R({\mathbb{M}})\, v\,=\,0\,$ necessitates $\,P({\mathbb{M}})v\,=\,0\,$ . This, in its turn, can be true only if $\,P\,$ is the zero polynomial: $\;P(x)\,=\,0\;$ and, therefore, $\,R\,$ is the zero function, $\,R(x)\,=\,0\,$ . In other words, only one element of the space $\,{\mathbb{C}}(x)\,$ , the function $\,R(x)\,=\,0\,$ , is mapped to the zero element $\,R({\mathbb{M}})\,=\,0\,$ of the space $\,\mbox{Hom}_C\,(V,\,V)\,$ . Hence the map $\,{\mathbb{C}}(x)\,\longrightarrow\,\mbox{Hom}_C\,(V,\,V)\,$ is injection -- which implies that the dimensionality of $\,\mbox{Hom}_C\,(V,\,V)\,$ is uncountable, because such is the dimensionality of ${\mathbb{C}}(x)\,$ . This, however, is incompatible with the assumption that $\,V\,$ is of countable dimensions. ${\mathbb{QED}}$ Now, my question. We have proven that, for some $\,c\in{\mathbb{C}}\,$ , the operator $\,{\mathbb{M}}\,-\,c\,{\mathbb{I}}\,$ is not invertible. Can we now use Schur's second lemma, to state that $\,{\mathbb{M}}\,$ is a scalar multiple of the identity operator? In finite dimensions, the noninvertibility of $\,{\mathbb{M}}\,-\,c\,{\mathbb{I}}\,$ is equivalent to $\,c\,$ being an eigenvalue of the matrix $\,{\mathbb{M}}\,$ . However, in infinite dimensions this is not necessarily so. When $\,{\mathbb{M}}\,-\,c\,{\mathbb{I}}\,$ is noninvertible (while the linear operator $\,{\mathbb{M}}\,$ is bounded), $\,c\,$ is said to belong to the spectrum of $\,{\mathbb{M}}\,$ -- which does not necessitate it being an eigenvalue. An operator on an  infinite-dimensional space may have a nonempty spectrum and, at the same time, lack eigenvalues. Despite this circumstance, will it be legitimate to say that, if $\exists\,c\in{\mathbb{C}}\,$ for which $\,{\mathbb{M}}\,-\,c\,{\mathbb{I}}\,$ is not invertible, $\,{\mathbb{M}}\,-\,c\,{\mathbb{I}}\,$ is an intertwiner of an irreducible representation to itself, Schur's second lemma works in all dimensions, then $\,{\mathbb{M}}\,-\,c\,{\mathbb{I}}\,=\,0\,$ and $\,{\mathbb{M}}\,$ is proportional to the identity operator?","What mathematicians call Schur's lemma is known to physicists as Schur's second lemma : An intertwiner of two irreducible representations of a group is either zero or isomorphism.

First some preliminaries: Every infinite polycyclic group contains a free abelian normal subgroup. On a polycyclic group one can use 'Noetherian' induction: If $G$ is polycyclic and doesn't have a property P, we can assume every proper quotient of $G$ has the property P, while $G$ doesn't.  (see the book Polycyclic groups by Daniel Segal) If $G$ is finitely generated and nilpotent of class $k$ , we can define the Hirsch length of $G$ as the sum $\sum_{i =1}^{k}m_i = h(G)$ where $m_i$ is the rank of the free part of $C^i(G)/C^{i+1}(G)$ .

(I was not able to locate an independent source for the Frobenius groups of order $100$ , and my results agree with the OEIS up to order $99$ .) The three groups that I am finding are Frobenius are those with small group IDs [[100, 3], [100, 11], [100, 12]]. In each of these cases, I get the following: the Frobenius kernel $K$ is the (necessarily abelian) Sylow $5$ -subgroup, which is also the Fitting subgroup. This is (uniquely, up to conjugacy) complemented, by Schur-Zassenhaus.

23,Free groups - extending quasi isometry to commuting square,Free groups - extending quasi isometry to commuting square,,"Let's assume one has a finitely generated free group on $n$- generators, and two homomorphisms : $F \rightarrow F/k_1$, $F \rightarrow F/k_2)$ (for $k_i$ normal subgroup ) such that $F/k_1$ is quasi-isometric to $F/k_2$ and we have one fixed QI $G: F/k_1 \rightarrow F/k_2$. Does it mean that there is a quasi isometry $H:F \rightarrow F$ giving a commuting square up to a bounded distance ? Since $F$ is a tree it is easy to show that we can inductively find quasi isometric embedding $H:F \rightarrow F$ which gives a commuting square but is it possible to extend it somehow to full quasi isometry? Edit: We have one fixed quasi-isometry $G: F/k_1 \rightarrow F/k_2$ . For anyone reading this post the comments are now irrelevant - I've updated it all to the post itself. Here's how I do my lift. We will denote the lift $H$. Let's denote projection $F \rightarrow F/k_1$ with $p$ and projection $F \rightarrow F/k_2$ with $q$. We equip $F$ with standard symmetric generating set $<a_1,..a_n>$ and we fix their projection images as generating sets for $F/k_i$. Additionaly let $c_i$ be a reduced word in $ k_2$ beggining with letter $a_i$ and of minimal norm (it always can be found if $k_2$ is not trivial). $e$ denotes the neutral element. We build our lift inductively.  Start with an injective lift of $\lbrace{ e,a_1,..,a_n \rbrace}$ and assume that $H(e) =e$ (for technical reasons and also I am specifically interested in a QI $G$ which sends neutral element to itself). By injective I mean the following : if$ |b| < |d| $ then $|H(b)| < |H(d)|$. Now assume we have an injective lift of elements from the ball of radius $n$ -$B(e,n) = \lbrace{ d \in F : |d| \le n \rbrace}$. Take any vertex $v$ of norm $n$  - we will describe lifting of elements $\gamma \in F$ such that $|\gamma^{-1} \cdot v| =1 $ and $|\gamma| > |v|$ (i.e. vertices which share one edge with $v$ but are further from the neutral element). Let's denote such vertices $\gamma_1,..,\gamma_{n-1}$. $G$ is a QI hence $d_{F/k_2}(G(p(v)),G(p(\gamma_{i})) \le K $ for some uniform constant $K$. As a result $G(p(v))^{-1} \cdot G(p(\gamma_i)) = q(a_{i_{1}}) \cdot ... \cdot q(a_{i_{k_{i}}})$ for $i = \lbrace{1,..,n-1 \rbrace}$ and for all $i$ we have that $ i_{k_{i}} \le K$.( it is the definition of the word metric $G(p(v))^{-1} \cdot G(p(\gamma_i))$ can be written as a word shorter then $K$ but for each $i$ word's letters and its lenght may differ -but we know they are uniformly bounded!). Since we have a lift of $v$  - denoted $H(v)$ , we can lift $\gamma_i$ to $H(\gamma_i) = H(v) \cdot a_{i_{1}} \cdot ... \cdot a_{i_{k_{i}}} \cdot c_{j_{i}}$. So far the choice of $c_{j_{i}}$ may be arbitrary - the lift will give us commuting square and will be coarse Lipschitz. But it should additionaly be QI embedding hence we choose $c_{j_{i}}$ in a special way - forcing the lifts to ""spread"". For given $i$ we choose $c_{j_{i}}$  in such a way that: i) $j_i \neq i_{k_{i}}$ hence word $ H(v) \cdot a_{i_{1}} \cdot ... \cdot a_{i_{k_{i}}} \cdot c_{j_{i}}$ is a reduced word. ii) we choose them in such a way that if $G(p(\gamma_m)) = G(p(\gamma_r)) $ then $c_{j_{m}} \neq c_{j_{r}}$ hence lifts $H(\gamma_m),H(\gamma_r$ separate at vertex $H(v)$ iii) and we even choose them so that $c_{j_{i}} \neq c_{j_{r}}$ if $ i \neq r$. Such choices can obviously be made. It ends the construction. Now let's take any two points $u,t \in F$ such that $d(u,t) = n$ it means that they are connected by a unique shortest path $d_0,..,d_n$ such that $d_0 = u,d_n =t$ and $d(d_i,d_{i+1})=1$. This path divides into two parts: $d_0,...,d_{s},d_{s+1},..,d_n$ For $i \le s $ $|d_{i}| <|d_{i-1}|$ and for $i \ge s $ we have that $|d_{i+1}| >|d_{i}|$ . The lift of the first part of the path path gives us path $H(d_0),..,H(d_s)$ such that $1 \le d(H(d_i),H(d_{i+1})) \le K'$ ($K'$ is a little bit bigger then $K$ because we have added $c_j$'s but nonetheless it is uniform. Now the very construction of the lift assures us that $ H(d_{i})$ lies in the complement of $F - H(d_{i+1})$ which does not contain lift of neutral element - $H(e)$ hence If you take the shortest path connecting $H(d_0),H(d_s)$ - $f_0,..,f_k$ ($d(f_j,f_{j+1}) =1$) then $H(d_i) $ lay on this path and if $ f_{j}$ is a vertex equal to $H(d_i)$ and $ f_l$ is a vertex equal to $H(d_{i+1})$ then $ l > j$ which means that $ d(H(d_0),H(d_s)) = k \ge \frac{1}{M+1} \cdot s = \frac{1}{M+1} \cdot d(d_0,d_s)$ ( informally speaking path $H(d_0,...,H(d_s)$ always flows forward from $H(e)$, never backwards ) We can conduct the same reasoning with the second part - $d_s,...,d_n$ - hence $ d(H(d_s),H(d_n)) = k \ge \frac{1}{M+1} \cdot (n-s) = \frac{1}{M+1} \cdot d(d_s,d_n)$ All that is left is to analyse the critical three points - $d_{s-1},d_{s},d_{s+1}$.

Does it mean that there is a quasi isometry $H:F \rightarrow F$ giving a commuting square up to a bounded distance ? Since $F$ is a tree it is easy to show that we can inductively find quasi isometric embedding $H:F \rightarrow F$ which gives a commuting square but is it possible to extend it somehow to full quasi isometry? Edit: We have one fixed quasi-isometry $G: F/k_1 \rightarrow F/k_2$ . For anyone reading this post the comments are now irrelevant - I've updated it all to the post itself. Here's how I do my lift. We will denote the lift $H$. Let's denote projection $F \rightarrow F/k_1$ with $p$ and projection $F \rightarrow F/k_2$ with $q$. We equip $F$ with standard symmetric generating set $<a_1,..a_n>$ and we fix their projection images as generating sets for $F/k_i$. Additionaly let $c_i$ be a reduced word in $ k_2$ beggining with letter $a_i$ and of minimal norm (it always can be found if $k_2$ is not trivial). $e$ denotes the neutral element. We build our lift inductively.  Start with an injective lift of $\lbrace{ e,a_1,..,a_n \rbrace}$ and assume that $H(e) =e$ (for technical reasons and also I am specifically interested in a QI $G$ which sends neutral element to itself). By injective I mean the following : if$ |b| < |d| $ then $|H(b)| < |H(d)|$. Now assume we have an injective lift of elements from the ball of radius $n$ -$B(e,n) = \lbrace{ d \in F : |d| \le n \rbrace}$. Take any vertex $v$ of norm $n$  - we will describe lifting of elements $\gamma \in F$ such that $|\gamma^{-1} \cdot v| =1 $ and $|\gamma| > |v|$ (i.e. vertices which share one edge with $v$ but are further from the neutral element). Let's denote such vertices $\gamma_1,..,\gamma_{n-1}$. $G$ is a QI hence $d_{F/k_2}(G(p(v)),G(p(\gamma_{i})) \le K $ for some uniform constant $K$. As a result $G(p(v))^{-1} \cdot G(p(\gamma_i)) = q(a_{i_{1}}) \cdot ... \cdot q(a_{i_{k_{i}}})$ for $i = \lbrace{1,..,n-1 \rbrace}$ and for all $i$ we have that $ i_{k_{i}} \le K$.( it is the definition of the word metric $G(p(v))^{-1} \cdot G(p(\gamma_i))$ can be written as a word shorter then $K$ but for each $i$ word's letters and its lenght may differ -but we know they are uniformly bounded!). Since we have a lift of $v$  - denoted $H(v)$ , we can lift $\gamma_i$ to $H(\gamma_i) = H(v) \cdot a_{i_{1}} \cdot ... \cdot a_{i_{k_{i}}} \cdot c_{j_{i}}$. So far the choice of $c_{j_{i}}$ may be arbitrary - the lift will give us commuting square and will be coarse Lipschitz. But it should additionaly be QI embedding hence we choose $c_{j_{i}}$ in a special way - forcing the lifts to ""spread"". For given $i$ we choose $c_{j_{i}}$  in such a way that: i) $j_i \neq i_{k_{i}}$ hence word $ H(v) \cdot a_{i_{1}} \cdot ... \cdot a_{i_{k_{i}}} \cdot c_{j_{i}}$ is a reduced word. ii) we choose them in such a way that if $G(p(\gamma_m)) = G(p(\gamma_r)) $ then $c_{j_{m}} \neq c_{j_{r}}$ hence lifts $H(\gamma_m),H(\gamma_r$ separate at vertex $H(v)$ iii) and we even choose them so that $c_{j_{i}} \neq c_{j_{r}}$ if $ i \neq r$. Such choices can obviously be made. It ends the construction. Now let's take any two points $u,t \in F$ such that $d(u,t) = n$ it means that they are connected by a unique shortest path $d_0,..,d_n$ such that $d_0 = u,d_n =t$ and $d(d_i,d_{i+1})=1$. This path divides into two parts: $d_0,...,d_{s},d_{s+1},..,d_n$ For $i \le s $ $|d_{i}| <|d_{i-1}|$ and for $i \ge s $ we have that $|d_{i+1}| >|d_{i}|$ . The lift of the first part of the path path gives us path $H(d_0),..,H(d_s)$ such that $1 \le d(H(d_i),H(d_{i+1})) \le K'$ ($K'$ is a little bit bigger then $K$ because we have added $c_j$'s but nonetheless it is uniform. Now the very construction of the lift assures us that $ H(d_{i})$ lies in the complement of $F - H(d_{i+1})$ which does not contain lift of neutral element - $H(e)$ hence If you take the shortest path connecting $H(d_0),H(d_s)$ - $f_0,..,f_k$ ($d(f_j,f_{j+1}) =1$) then $H(d_i) $ lay on this path and if $ f_{j}$ is a vertex equal to $H(d_i)$ and $ f_l$ is a vertex equal to $H(d_{i+1})$ then $ l > j$ which means that $ d(H(d_0),H(d_s)) = k \ge \frac{1}{M+1} \cdot s = \frac{1}{M+1} \cdot d(d_0,d_s)$ ( informally speaking path $H(d_0,...,H(d_s)$ always flows forward from $H(e)$, never backwards ) We can conduct the same reasoning with the second part - $d_s,...,d_n$ - hence $ d(H(d_s),H(d_n)) = k \ge \frac{1}{M+1} \cdot (n-s) = \frac{1}{M+1} \cdot d(d_s,d_n)$ All that is left is to analyse the critical three points - $d_{s-1},d_{s},d_{s+1}$.

In my own notations, here is the hypothesis. For arbitrary group $F$ the (cardinal) number of conjugacy classes of $F$ is denoted by $\mathrm{c}(F)$ and for arbitrary subset $X \subseteq F$ the centraliser of $X$ in $F$ is written as $\mathrm{C}_{F}(X)$ . For arbitrary set $M$ the full symmetric group on $M$ shall be denoted by $\Sigma(M)$ . $\mathbf{Gr}$ refers to the category of groups. Let $G$ be a finite nonabelian group and let us denote the largest prime divisor of the order $|G|$ by $p$ . Given the relation $\mathrm{c}(G)>\frac{|G|}{p}$ , prove that $\mathrm{Z}(G)$ is not trivial. The problem follows the chapter which introduces group actions, representations by permutations, elementary properties of conjugation etc, so it should not require tools too sophisticated to solve (such as character theory). My thoughts are to attempt Reductio ad absurdum by assuming the centre were trivial, to the effect that the number $\mathrm{c}(G)-1$ of nontrivial conjugacy classes is at least equal to $\frac{|G|}{p}$ . This further means that at least one of these nontrivial classes -- say $C$ -- has cardinality strictly less than $p$ , otherwise the union over all these classes -- expressible as $G \setminus \mathrm{Z}(G)=G \setminus \{1_G\}$ by virtue of our assumption and hence of cardinality $|G|-1$ -- has at the same time cardinality $\geqslant |G|$ , which is absurd. Let us write $m=|C|$ . Thus, $G$ acts transitively (by conjugation) on $C$ , action which induces a permutation representation $\rho \in \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbf{Gr}}(G, \Sigma(C))$ . The kernel of this representation is clearly given by $\mathrm{Ker} \rho=\mathrm{C}_G(C)$ , so it follows that $(G:\mathrm{C}_G(C))|\ m!$ . If it were the case that $p$ divides this index we would derive $p|m!$ , which is equivalent to $p \leqslant m$ and contradicts one of the previous conclusions. Hence we gather that $p|\ |\mathrm{C}_G(C)|$ .....and what of it?! The reasoning above doesn't take into account the special property that $p$ has (of being the maximum among the set of prime divisors of $|G|$ ), which is indication that it is perhaps not the way to go searching for a proof... Attempting to reason by contradiction by means of assuming the existence of a minimal (in the sense of order) counterexample also doesn't seem too promising, since the behaviour of either centres or conjugacy classes is rather hard to control when passing on to subgroups, in general. All in all the problem doesn't seem to conceal anything too profound, but alas I see myself lacking in ideas to approach it.

My question is: What does the representation of $U(1)$ labeled as $\frac{1}{2}$ indicate? My question is a group-theory question, and is as such a math question, but for those unfamiliar with the context, here is some background. The superconformal group for $\mathcal{N} = 1$ supersymmetry in  $d = 4$ spacetime dimensions is $SU(2,2|1)$. We focus our attention on a particular subgroup of $SU(2,2|1)$, called the maximal bosonic subgroup: $SU(2,2) \times U(1)_R$. The $U(1)_R$ is known as an R-symmetry group in physics. The generators of supersymmetry (the ''supercharges'') $Q$ and $Q^\dagger$ belong to representations $4_1$ and $\bar{4}_{-1}$ of $SU(2,2) \times U(1)_R$. The subscript denotes the $U(1)_R$ representation ($1$ is the fundamental, $-1$ is the anti-fundamental) and the $4$ and $\bar{4}$ are $SU(2,2)$ representations. So, so far we are labeling everything in terms of irreps of the maximal bosonic subgroup. The conformal group in $d = 4$ spacetime dimensions is $SO(4,2)$, which has a covering group $SU(2,2)$. We want to study a quantum field theory not in 4-dimensional Minkowski (""flat"") space but on the space $\mathbb{R} \times S^3$. So one is interested in the Killing spinors of this space, and the isometries. Based on (4) and (5), we restrict our attention to the subgroup $U(1) \times SO(4)$ of the conformal group, which is the isometry group of $\mathbb{R} \times S^3$. The idea then is to decompose the generators in terms of representations of the isometry group $SU(2)_l \times SU(2)_r \times U(1)$ and the R-symmetry $U(1)_R$. Here we've used the fact that $\mathbb{so(4)} = \mathbb{su}(2)_l \times \mathbb{su}(2)_r$. The claim is $$4_1 \longrightarrow (2,1)_{\frac{1}{2},1} \oplus (1,2)_{-\frac{1}{2},1}$$ $$\bar{4}_{-1} \longrightarrow (2,1)_{-\frac{1}{2},-1} \oplus (1,2)_{\frac{1}{2},-1}$$ There are now two $U(1)$ subscripts: the first is for the $U(1)$ which is part of the isometry group, and the second is for the $U(1)_R$ which is the R-symmetry group. Note that the $U(1)_R$ subscript is the same on each term on the right hand side and carries over from the left. The question posed above pertains to the first subscript in the above decomposition, i.e. the representation of the $U(1)$ which is part of the isometry group of the manifold. I know that an element in $U(1)$ is represented by $e^{i\theta}$ and moreover, $U(1)$ is isomorphic to $SO(2)$. The latter made me think of the irreducible spinor representation of $SO(2)$, but that too is a real 1-dimensional representation (2d Dirac spinor with 2 complex components, but the Majorana-Weyl condition brings it down to 1 real component). Also, if $U(1)$ is parametrized by $\left(\begin{array}{cc}\cos n\theta & \sin n\theta\\-\sin n\theta & \cos n\theta\end{array}\right)$, does $\frac{1}{2}$ simply mean that $n = 1/2$ in this representation, so that effectively, its a half rotation?","This may be a silly question, and so I apologize in advance.

Assume that  $$ A\le Z(N_G(A)) $$ Then  $G$ has a normal $p-$complement for every prime divisor $p$ of $|A|$ I am following the indications given. Argue by induction on $|G|$. If $G=1$, there is nothing to prove.  Let $P\in Syl_p(A)$. Assume that $N_G(P)<G$. As $A$ is abelian, $P\triangleleft A$ and so $A\le N_G(P)<G$. Hence $A$ is an abelian Hall subgroup of $N_G(P)$. By hypothesis, $A\le Z(N_G(A))$ and since $N_{N_G(P)}(A)\le N_G(A)$, it follows that  $$ A\le Z(N_{N_G(P)}(A)) $$  By the induction hypothesis, it follows that $P$ has a normal complement in $N_G(P)$ i.e. there is $K\triangleleft N_G(P)$ such that $N_G(P)=PK$ and $P\cap K=1$. Since $P$ is abelian, $P=Z(P)$. Moreover, since $P,K\triangleleft N_G(P)$, $[P,K]\le P\cap K=1$ and so $P\le Z(K)$. Hence $P\le Z(N_G(P))$ and, by by Burnside's transfer lemma, $P$ has a normal complement in $G$. Assume that $P\triangleleft G$. If every Sylow subgroup of $A$ is normal in $G$, we are done. Indeed, since $A$ is an Hall subgroup of $G$, every such subgroup is a Sylow subgroup of $G$ and therefore $G$ is nilpotent (and thus $p-$nilpotent for every prime $p$). Therefore assume that there is $Q\le Syl_q(G)$ for $q\neq p$ such that $N_G(Q)<G$. I now show that $P\le Z(N_G(Q))$. By the same reasoning as above, $A\le Z(N_{N_G(Q)}(A))$. Hence $N_G(Q)$ has a normal $p-$complement for every prime divisor $p$ of $|A|$. By the lemma below, $A$ has a normal complement in $N_G(Q)$  i.e. there is $L\le N_G(Q)$ such that $N_G(Q)=AL$ and $A\cap L=1$. Since $A$ is abelian, $P\le Z(A)$ and $P\le C_G(Q)\le N_G(Q)$. Since $P\triangleleft G$, it follows that $P\triangleleft N_G(Q)$. Therefore $[P,L]\le P\cap L\le A\cap L=1$. Hence $P\le Z(L)$ and so $P\le Z(N_G(Q))$. From there I am stuck. Above, I have used the following lemma. Lemma:  Let G be a finite group and $A$ an abelian subgroup of $G$. Write $A=P_1...P_n$ where the $P_i$ are the Sylow $p_i-$subgroups of $A$ for $1\leq i\leq n$. Assume each $P_i$ has a normal $(p_i-)$complement $K_i$ in $G$. Then $A$ has a normal complement in $G$ and it is $K_1 \cap...\cap K_n$. Proof: We first show that $P_1...P_n \cap \bigcap\limits_{1\leq i\leq n}K_i=1$. Since $A$ is abelian, each $P_i$ is a a normal subgroup of $A$ and so any product of the $P_i$ is a subgroup of $A$ and obviously of $G$. Since $[G:K_1]\wedge |P_2|=1$, it follows that $P_2\le K_1$. Now, by the modular law,  $$ P_1P_2\cap K_1=P_2(P_1\cap K_1)=P_2 $$ and thus $$ P_1P_2\cap K_1\cap K_2=P_2\cap K_2=1 $$ The result then follows by induction. We have $[G:\bigcap\limits_{1\leq i\leq n}K_i] \leq \prod\limits_{1\leq i\leq n} [G:K_i]$. Hence $$ |\bigcap\limits_{1\leq i\leq n}K_i| \geq \dfrac{|G|}{\prod\limits_{1\leq i\leq n} [G:K_i]}=\dfrac{|G|}{\prod\limits_{1\leq i\leq n} |P_i|} $$ Now $|P_1...P_n|=\prod\limits_{1\leq i\leq n} |P_i|$ since the $P_i$ are all coprime. Hence $|P_1...P_n \bigcap\limits_{1\leq i\leq n} K_i| \geq |G|$. And so $G=P_1...P_n \bigcap\limits_{1\leq i\leq n} K_i$. Last, since $K_i \triangleleft G$ for all i, we have $\bigcap\limits_{1\leq i\leq n}K_i \triangleleft G$ and so $K=\bigcap\limits_{1\leq i\leq n}K_i$ is the normal complement of $P_1...P_n$. I found the solution. By the same reasoning as above, $Q\le N_G(Z(Q))$ and so by Burnside's transfer theorem, $Q$ has a normal complement $L$ in $G$. Now as $P\triangleleft G$, $P$ is the unique Sylow $p-$subgroup of $G$ and so $P\le L$. Then $P$ is an abelian normal Hall subgroup of $L$ and so, by Schur E, $P$ has a normal complement $K$ in $L$. Since $P\triangleleft L$, it follows that $L=P\times K$. We have $$G=QL=QKP$$ and we show that $QK$ is a normal complement to $P$ in $G$. Actually we show that $G=P\times QK$. It suffices to show that $[P,QK]=P\cap QK=1$. $Q$ is clearly a $p'-$group. Since $P$ is a Sylow sybgroup of $L$, it follows that $K$ is also a $p'-$group. Since $Q\cap K=1$, $|QK|=|Q||K|$ is a $p'$number. Hence, by Lagrange's theorem, $P\cap QK=1$. Trivially, $[P,Q]=1$. And $[P,K]=1$ since $L=P\times K$. Hence $[P,QK]=1$. I believe the following proof works. We show by induction on $|G|$ that $G$ has a normal $p-$complement for every prime divisor $p$ of $|A|$, which gives immediately the result by the lemma. If $G=1$, there is nothing to prove.  Let $P\in Syl_p(A)$. Assume that $N_G(P)<G$. As $A$ is abelian, $P\triangleleft A$ and so $A\le N_G(P)<G$. Hence $A$ is an abelian Hall subgroup of $N_G(P)$. By hypothesis, $A\le Z(N_G(A))$ and since $N_{N_G(P)}(A)\le N_G(A)$, it follows that  $$ A\le Z(N_{N_G(P)}(A)) $$  By the induction hypothesis, it follows that $P$ has a normal complement in $N_G(P)$ i.e. there is $K\triangleleft N_G(P)$ such that $N_G(P)=PK$ and $P\cap K=1$. Since $P$ is abelian, $[P,P]=1$. Moreover, since $P,K\triangleleft N_G(P)$, $[P,K]\le P\cap K=1$ and so $[P,K]=1$. Hence $P\le Z(N_G(P))$ and, by Burnside's transfer theorem, $P$ has a normal complement in $G$. Assume that $P\triangleleft G$. If every Sylow subgroup of $A$ is normal in $G$, we are done. Indeed, it implies that $A\triangleleft G$ and so by hypothesis, $A\le Z(G)$. By Schur-Zassenhaus, $A$ has a complement $K$ in $G$. This complement is normal in $G$ as trivially $K\le N_G(K)$ and $A \le N_G(K)$ since $A\le Z(G)$ and therefore $G=AK\le N_G(K)$.  Therefore assume that there is $Q\le Syl_q(G)$ for $q\neq p$ such that $N_G(Q)<G$. We show that $P\le Z(N_G(Q))$. By induction, $A$ has a normal complement in $N_G(Q)$  i.e. there is $L\triangleleft N_G(Q)$ such that $N_G(Q)=AL$ and $A\cap L=1$. Since $A$ is abelian, $[P,A]=1$ and $P\le C_G(Q)\le N_G(Q)$. Since $P\triangleleft G$, it follows that $P\triangleleft N_G(Q)$. Therefore $[P,L]\le P\cap L\le A\cap L=1$. Hence $[P,N_G(Q)]=[P,AL]=1$ and so $P\le Z(N_G(Q))$. We will prove that $P$ is contained in the center of $G$ and since $P$ is normal in $G$, we have that $P\le Z(N_G(P))$, so $P$ has a normal $p$-complement by Burnside's Theorem. If $g \in G$ then $[P,Q^g]=[P^g,Q^g]=[P,G]^g=1$ where the first equality follows from the fact that $P$ is normal in $G$ and the last from the fact that $[P,Q]=1$ since $P<Z(N_G(Q))$. This means that $P$ commutes with all the conjugates of $Q$ in $G$ and then commutes with the normal closure $Q^G$. If $Q^G=G$ then $P$ commutes with the whole $G$ and it is in the center, so we are done. If $Q^G<G$ then $Q^G$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ containing $Q$ that is a $q$-Sylow of $G$ and by Frattini Argument $G=N_G(Q)Q^G$. But $P$ commutes with both $N_G(Q)$ and $Q^G$ and then commutes with their product $G$, in other words $P<Z(G)$.","I am trying to solve the following exercise:  Let $G$ be a finite group and $A$ a Hall abelian subgroup of $G$.

Then $A$ has a normal complement in $G$ and it is $K_1 \cap...\cap K_n$. Proof: We first show that $P_1...P_n \cap \bigcap\limits_{1\leq i\leq n}K_i=1$. Since $A$ is abelian, each $P_i$ is a a normal subgroup of $A$ and so any product of the $P_i$ is a subgroup of $A$ and obviously of $G$. Since $[G:K_1]\wedge |P_2|=1$, it follows that $P_2\le K_1$. Now, by the modular law,  $$ P_1P_2\cap K_1=P_2(P_1\cap K_1)=P_2 $$ and thus $$ P_1P_2\cap K_1\cap K_2=P_2\cap K_2=1 $$ The result then follows by induction. We have $[G:\bigcap\limits_{1\leq i\leq n}K_i] \leq \prod\limits_{1\leq i\leq n} [G:K_i]$. Hence $$ |\bigcap\limits_{1\leq i\leq n}K_i| \geq \dfrac{|G|}{\prod\limits_{1\leq i\leq n} [G:K_i]}=\dfrac{|G|}{\prod\limits_{1\leq i\leq n} |P_i|} $$ Now $|P_1...P_n|=\prod\limits_{1\leq i\leq n} |P_i|$ since the $P_i$ are all coprime. Hence $|P_1...P_n \bigcap\limits_{1\leq i\leq n} K_i| \geq |G|$. And so $G=P_1...P_n \bigcap\limits_{1\leq i\leq n} K_i$. Last, since $K_i \triangleleft G$ for all i, we have $\bigcap\limits_{1\leq i\leq n}K_i \triangleleft G$ and so $K=\bigcap\limits_{1\leq i\leq n}K_i$ is the normal complement of $P_1...P_n$.

In this case, $G$ has a unique (hence normal) Sylow $2$-subgroup $S$ of order $8$ (index $15$).

Since $n_2(G) = |G:N_G(S)|$ where $S \in Syl_2(G)$, the subgroup $N_G(S)$ has index $3$. Case 3: $n_2(G) = 5$. Then as in case 2, the normalizer of any Sylow $2$-subgroup has index $5$. Case 4: $n_2(G) = 15$. Here, I use the following theorem, proved earlier in the chapter. Suppose that $G$ is a finite group such that $n_p(G) > 1$, and choose distinct Sylow $p$-subgroups $S$ and $T$ of $G$ such that the order of $|S \cap T|$ is as large as possible. Then $n_p(G) \equiv 1$ mod $|S:S \cap T|$. Since $n_2(G) = 15$ is not congruent to $1$ mod $8$ or mod $4$, this theorem implies that there are $S,T \in Syl_2(G)$ such that $|S:S \cap T| = 2$, i.e. $|S \cap T| = 4$. Therefore $S\cap T \lhd S$ and $S \cap T \lhd T$, which means that $S \leq N_G(S\cap T)$ and $T \leq N_G(S\cap T)$. We write $H = N_G(S \cap T)$ for brevity. Note that $n_2(H) \equiv 1$ mod $2$, and we have $S,T \in Syl_2(H)$, so in fact $n_2(H) \geq 3$. This means that $H$ contains at least $16$ elements, so $|G:H| \leq 7$. Also, $8$ divides $|H|$, so $|G:H|$ is either $1$, $3$, or $5$. If $|G:H|$ is $3$ or $5$, then we're done: $H$ is the desired subgroup. If $|G:H| = 1$, then $S \cap T \lhd G$.

This is trivial. $H\subset K$. This is because $H$ leaves all cosets $gK$ unmoved — including $K$. $H \lhd G$.

The above formula demonstrates that $g^{-1}hg$ stabilises any $g'K$, so $g^{-1}hg\in H$. In other words, $g^{-1}Hg=H$. $H$ is the maximal normal subgroup of $G$, contained in $K$. Suppose there exists a bigger normal subgroup $H'$ contained in $K$: $$H<H'<K,\quad H\lhd G, \quad H'\lhd G.$$ Consider a group element $x$ which is in $H'$ but not in $H$. The latter implies that $\hat{L}_x$ does not stabilise $G/K$: $$x\in H',x \notin H \implies \exists g, xgK\neq gK,$$ or, the same: $$\exists k\in K,xgk\notin gK\iff g^{-1}xgk\notin K,$$ the latter being in contradiction with the proposition that $H'\lhd G$.

99,Proof by contradiction using properties of normal subgroup: A group is cyclic if $x^m=e$ has at most $m$ solutions.,Proof by contradiction using properties of normal subgroup: A group is cyclic if  has at most  solutions.,x^m=e m,"Statement : Let $G$ be a finite group. Show that if for each positive integer $m$ the number of solutions $x$ of the equation $x^n=e$ in $G$ is at most $n$ , then $G$ is cyclic. There are various proofs available as answers to this post . Inspired by this answer (which I did not find convincing), I am attempting to write a proof on my own ( point out errors or fallacies, if any ). My attempt : Define : $\mathcal S(n) := \{ g\in G \ | \ g^n=e\}$ Given : $G$ is finite and $ |\mathcal S(n)|\leq n$ for all $n\in \mathbb Z^+$ . Assumption : Suppose, if possible, $G$ be non-cyclic. $G$ is finite $\implies$ G has at least one element (say, $x$ ) of maximal order $M$ . $M=\max\{\DeclareMathOperator{\ord}{ord}\ord(g) \ | \ g\in G\}\tag*{}$ $G$ being non-cyclic, $M\neq |G|$ , for otherwise, $x$ will generate $G$ . $G$ is non-cyclic $\implies$ $G\setminus \langle x \rangle$ is non-empty, so it has at least one element (say, $y$ ) of minmal order $m$ . $m=\min\{\ord(g) \ | \ g\in G\setminus \langle x \rangle \}\tag*{}$ Claim 1 : $\mathcal S(M) =\langle x\rangle$ and $\mathcal S(m) =\langle y\rangle$ This can be proven by a counting argument. All elements of $\langle x\rangle$ satisfy the equation $g^M=e$ so, $\langle x\rangle\subseteq \mathcal S(M)$ . Now, use that fact that $|\langle x\rangle|= \ord(x)=M$ and that $|\mathcal S(M)|\leq M$ . Claim 2 : $\langle x\rangle$ and $\langle y \rangle$ are normal in $G$ . For all $g\in G$ and $h\in \langle x\rangle $ , $(ghg^{-1})^M=gh^Mg^{-1}=e\implies ghg^{-1}\in \mathcal S(M)=\langle x\rangle\tag*{}$ Repeat the same argument for $\langle y\rangle$ . Lemma : If $H$ and $K$ are normal subgroups of any group $G$ such that $H\cap K=\{e\}$ then the elements of $H$ and $K$ commute with each other. For all $h\in H$ and $k\in K$ , $hkh^{-1}{k^{-1}}=\underbrace{(hkh^{-1})}_{\in K}k^{-1}=h\underbrace{(khk^{-1})^{-1}}_{\in H}\tag*{}$ By normality and closure, $hkh^{-1}k^{-1}\in H\cap K$ so, $hkh^{-1}k^{-1}=e$ . Now  with these claims and lemmas at hand, we are equipped to proceed. There are three possible cases: Case 1 : $\DeclareMathOperator{\gcd}{gcd}\gcd(M,m)=1$ . This would mean that $S(M)\cap S(m)=\{e\}$ and hence, $\langle x\rangle \cap \langle y\rangle=\{e\}$ . Now, claim 2 followed by the lemma, we know that $xy=yx$ . $\therefore$ $\ord(xy)=\DeclareMathOperator{\lcm}{lcm}\lcm(M,m)=Mm\leq M$ ( $\because$ $M$ is the maximal order of $G$ ) $\iff m=1$ . Now, $\ord(y)=1\implies y=e \in \langle x\rangle$ . This is a contradiction because $y$ was chosen such that $y\in G\setminus \langle x\rangle$ . We can conclude that in this case, $G\setminus \langle x\rangle$ is empty, so $G=\langle x\rangle$ as required. Case 2 : $1<\gcd(M,m)<m$ Suppose $\text{gcd}(M,m)=d$ for some $1<d<m$ . $\quad$ Claim 2.1 : $y^d\not \in \langle x\rangle$ . $\ord(y^d)=m/d$ . However, as a consequence of Lagrange's theorem, $\langle x\rangle $ cannot not have any element of this order because $m/d$ does not divide $M$ . In fact, $\gcd(M, m/d)=1$ because we have removed the highest possible common factor from $m$ . By the requirement that $m$ is the minimal order in $G\setminus \langle x\rangle$ : $m=\min\left(m, \ord(y^d) \right)\implies m\leq \frac{m}d \implies d=1$ which is the case 1. Case 3 : $\gcd(M,m)=m$ i.e., $m$ divides $M$ . $\ord(y)=m, \ m\ | \ M \implies y^M=e \implies y\in\mathcal S(M)=\langle x\rangle\tag*{}$ This is again a contradiction because of choice of $y\in G\setminus \langle x\rangle$ . This completes the proof. $\blacksquare$ What I did not find convincing in the linked answer : In the linked answer, the case 2 was $d=\gcd(m,M)>1$ and the element $y^{m/d}$ was picked from $\langle y\rangle$ which is of order $d$ . Then it was argued that $m$ is the minimal order so, $d\leq m$ and hence, $d=m$ . But $m$ is the minimal order of elements of $G\setminus \langle  x\rangle$ . How are we guaranteed that $y^{m/d}\not \in \langle x\rangle$ ? I think it is possible that $y^{m/d}\in \langle x\rangle$ so it can have an order less than $m$ . Am I missing out on something or is this really a flaw in the linked proof ? Update : Unfortunately, I found a mistake...The argument for claim 2.1 is false. $m/d$ may divide $M$ and it's not necessary that $\text{gcd}(m/d, M)=1$ . For instance, $\text{gcd}(4,6)=2$ but $4/2$ does divide $6$ .  So there needs to be some way to rewrite the proof for case 2.","Statement : Let be a finite group.
