0,How Different is an Eigenvalue Problem from an Ordinary Differential Equation,How Different is an Eigenvalue Problem from an Ordinary Differential Equation,,"I have been thinking about how different an eigenvalue problem such as that of the Sturm-Liouville Equation (SL) with that of a second-order linear differential equation. It doesn't seem to be the case to be the difference between a boundary value problem vs. an initial value problem, as we may also have BVPs that do not involve eigenvalues, in which case solutions might not exist in abundance as opposed to the case with IVPs. Perhaps, the eigenvalue parameter is there to allow us to speak of to which values of the parameter there exist a solution. However, that brought me to the question as to what happens when no boundary values are imposed, such as in the case of the famous Simple Harmonic Oscillator (SHO) SL problem in Quantum Mechanics (QM), where the wavefunction, i.e. the solution of the ""eigenvalue"" problem, is defined throughout the entire real line without any restriction - except for the fact that they approach the $x$ -axis asymptotically, which actually follows from square-integrability. I put the word ""eigenvalue"" in quotation marks because I am now questioning it. Let me explain. The SHO problem is the seeking of the solution $\psi$ to the ""eigenvalue"" problem $\displaystyle-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2}+\frac{1}{2}m\omega^2x^2\psi=E\psi$ . We can clean up the equation by absorbing constants, but we will keep them. It is well-known in QM that solutions to this eigenvalue problem are products of Hermite polynomials with a Gaussian and the eigenvalues $E$ form a discrete set and are given by $E_n=\left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega$ . Note that no boundary conditions are imposed although, of course, we are seeking for square-integrable functions. Herein lies the question: If we rewrite the SHO equation as $\displaystyle-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2}+\left(\frac{1}{2}m\omega^2x^2-E\right)\psi=0$ , it does look to me like a legit 2nd order variable-coefficient linear ODE that has a solution for any $E$ . Specifically, $E$ does not have to assume specific values that form a discrete set. What am I missing here? That not all $E$ s give square-integrable solutions? How is the SHO an eigenvalue problem and not a mundane differential equation problem? Appreciate your insights.","I have been thinking about how different an eigenvalue problem such as that of the Sturm-Liouville Equation (SL) with that of a second-order linear differential equation.

9,How to find a second solution for ODE $xy''+3y'+x^3y=0$?,How to find a second solution for ODE ?,xy''+3y'+x^3y=0,"I need some help with this problem. I need to solve the differential equation $$xy''+3y'+x^3y=0$$ using power series. I used Frobenius method to expand about $x=0$ since it is an singular regular point. So I assumed a solution $y(x)=\sum_{j=0}^\infty a_jx^{s+j}$ . After replacing it on the origina equation I ended up with: $$\sum_{j=0}^\infty a_j(s+j)(s+j-1)x^{s+j-1}+3\sum_{j=0}^\infty a_j(s+j)x^{s+j-1}+\sum_{j=0}^\infty a_jx^{s+j+3}=0$$ In order to equal the exponents of $x$ , I expanded the first four terms in the first two series and ended up with the inditial equation: $$s^2+2s=0\Rightarrow s=0 \qquad s=-2$$ Now, because of the fact that the two roots differ by an integer, that means that the higher root will yield a solution while the smaller may or may not. Thus, for $s=0$ I found that the solution is $$y_1(x)=a_0\sum_{j=0}^\infty\frac{(-1)^j}{2^{2j}(2j+1)!}x^{4j}$$ I'm struggling to find the second solution. I tried to use two methods. The first one by using: $$y_2(x)=y_1(x)\int^x\frac{\exp\left[-\int^{x_2}P(x_1)dx_1\right]}{\left[y_1(x_2)\right]^2}dx_2$$ where $P(x)=\frac{3}{x}$ , but I dont know what to do with the term $[y_1(x)]^2$ . The second method I tried was to use the series form of the second solution that my book (Mathematical Methods for physicists, Arfken) gives by writing $P(x)=\sum_{i=-1}^\infty p_ix^i$ and $Q(x)=\sum_{j=-2}^\infty q_jx^j$ , replacing that in the integral form of the first method gives $$y_2(x)=y_1(x)\ln|x|+\sum_{j=-n}^\infty d_jx^{j+\alpha}$$ where $n$ is the difference between the two roots of the inditial equation and $\alpha$ is the higher root. When I tried this method, I replaced $y_2(x)$ in the original ODE usiing $n=2$ and $\alpha=0$ . After taking the derivatives and with the fact that $y_1(x)$ is a solution, I ended up with this: $$2\left(\frac{y_1(x)}{x}+y_1'(x)\right)+\sum_{j=-2}^\infty [j(j-1)+3j]d_j x^{j-1}+\sum_{j=-2}^\infty d_j x^{j+3}=0$$ The problem here is the term $2\left(\frac{y_1(x)}{x}+y_1'(x)\right)$ , I don't know what to do with it.

Rearranging we get $$a_1 = -2a_0$$ $$a_2 = -a_1$$ $$a_3 = -\frac{2}{3}a_2$$ ... etc back substituting we get $$f(z) \leftrightarrow a_0,-2a_0,2a_0,-\frac{4}{3}a_0,\frac{4}{6}a_0,...,\frac{(-2)^{n}}{n!}$$ this implies then that $$f(z) = a_0\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-2)^{n}}{n!}z^n$$ which is agrees with the above, ie $ f(z) = a_0 e^{-2z} $ using initial conditions again gives us $a_0$ = -1 and so $$f(z) = -e^{-2z}$$ so i was correct i believe. if someone could confirm, i'd greatly appreciate it.","Find all analytic functions such that and the only thing that majorly concerns me is making sure my answer is unique. as i'm sure it's possible that there may be a class of functions anyway the preferred method i believe is to expand these as power series such as do a bit of rearranging and then use the fact that co-effecient of power series are uniquely defined. i'm sure theres a bit of rearranging magic to be done as considering the co-effecients at the moment gives which of course only happens at apparently, but we have it that so that doesn't make sense. i can either presume there to be no solution or try the aforementioned rearrangement magic. by all means if you have a hint for how to solve this using the power series i'm all ears. anyway, the method i used. we have and these are meant to be analytic, so they're differentiable and integratable. so considering it to be a first order homogeneous ODE we solve using integrating factor Differentiating and using the initial conditions given above we have and so which indeed satisfies the requirements of both being analytic and the initial conditions. now, with ODE's we use Initial conditions in order to guarantee uniqueness of solutions but assuming that is also a solution, plugging this into the above we obviously get but.... is this function unique? and is this a valid arguement Cheers for the help.

46,Vector field induced by parallel translation is smooth,Vector field induced by parallel translation is smooth,,"I'm studying properties of flat manifolds, and I've come across the following lemma (from ""Introduction to Riemannian Manifolds"" by John M. Lee): Suppose $M$ is a smooth manifold, and $\nabla$ is any connection on $M$ satisfying $$ \nabla_X \nabla_Y Z - \nabla_Y \nabla_X Z = \nabla_{[X,Y]}Z, \qquad \forall \: X, Y, Z \in \mathcal{X}(M). $$ Then given $p \in M$ and any vector $v \in T_pM$ , there exists a parallel vector field $V$ on a neighborhood of $p$ such that $V_p = v$ . Lee constructs the vector field in the following way: define a coordinate cube $C_\epsilon = \{(x^1, \ldots x^n) : |x^i| < \epsilon \: \forall i\} \subset M$ centered at $p \in M$ . Parallel-transport $v$ along the $x^1$ -axis, then from each point $(c^1, 0, \ldots, 0)$ on the $x^1$ axis, parallel-transport the resulting vector along the coordinate curve $t \mapsto (c^1, t, 0, \ldots, 0)$ ""parallel"" to the $x^2$ -axis. Then do the same thing to along the curve $t \mapsto (c^1, c^2, t, 0, \ldots, 0)$ , etc. This eventually defines a rough vector field $V$ on the coordinate cube $C_\epsilon$ . Claim: The vector field $V$ defined like so is smooth. What I've tried: This supposedly follows from the existence and uniqueness theorem for systems of linear differential equations: Let $I \subset \mathbb R$ bea n open interval, and for $1 \leq j, k \leq n$ , let $A_j^k : I \to \mathbb R$ be smooth functions. For all $t_0 \in I$ and every initial vector $c = (c^1, \ldots, c^n) \in \mathbb R^n$ , the linear initial value problem \begin{align*} \dot V^k(t) &= A_j^k(t) V^j(t) \\ V^k(t_0) &= c^k \end{align*} has a unique smooth solution on all of $I$ , and the solution depends smoothly on $(t_0,c) \in I \times \mathbb R^n$ . I can show this if $\dim M = 1$ . Suppose it's true if $\dim M = n-1$ . Let $N = C_{\epsilon} \cap \{x^n = 0\}$ . Then $V$ is smooth on $N$ . For each curve $\gamma_c(t) = (c^1, \ldots, c^{n-1}, t)$ for $c \in \mathbb R^{n-1}$ , parallel-translate $V$ along $\gamma_c(t)$ . Since $V$ is parallel along $\gamma_c$ , $D_tV \equiv 0$ , or $$ \dot V^k(t) = -\dot\gamma^i_c(t) V^j(t) \Gamma_{ij}^k(\gamma_c(t)) \quad \forall k = 1, \ldots, n,  $$ where $\Gamma_{ij}^k : C_\epsilon \to \mathbb R$ are the Christoffel symbols of $\nabla$ in $C_\epsilon$ -coordinates. Since $\dot\gamma_c(t) = \partial_{n}\big|_{\gamma_c(t)}$ , we know $\dot\gamma_c^i \equiv \delta_n^i$ . So along each curve $t \mapsto (c,t) \in C_\epsilon$ , $c \in \mathbb R^{n-1}$ , the coordinates of $V$ satisfy the initial value problem \begin{align*} \dot V^k(c,t) &= -V^j(c,t) \Gamma_{nj}^k\left(c^1, \ldots, c^{n-1},t\right) \\ V^k(c,0) &= V^k\big|_N(c,0) \end{align*} If we could let $A^k_j(t) = -\Gamma_{nj}^k(c,t)$ , then we'd be good and the problem would be solved by induction and the existence and uniqueness theorem (since the solution depends smoothly on choice of initial condition). My problem: I'm not sure the functions $A^k_j$ are allowed to depend on the initial condition. Changing our initial condition in this case also changes the functions $A^k_j$ .

71,Exact Differential Equation Integrating Factor,Exact Differential Equation Integrating Factor,,"Finding an integrating factor can be a genuine mathematical art.    However, certain differential forms can remind us of differentiation   techniques that may aid in the solution of the equation at hand.  For   example, seeing $x\ dy + y\ dx$ reminds us of the product rule, as in $d(xy) = x\ dx + y\ dy$ [sic], and $x\ dy - y\ dx$ might remind us of the   quotient rule, $d(x/y) = \frac{y\ dx - x\ dy}{y^2}$ .  In the equation $x\ dy + y\ dx + 3xy^2\ dy = 0$ , we are again reminded of the product   rule.  In fact, if you multiply the equation by $\frac{1}{xy}$ , then $\frac{x\ dy\ +\ y\ dx}{xy} + 3y\ dy = 0 \implies d(ln(xy)) + 3y\ dy = 0 \implies ln(xy) + \frac{3}{2}y^2 = C$ .  Use these ideas to find a   general solution for the differential equation $$(x^2 - y^2)(x\ dy + y\ dx) = 2xy(x\ dy - y\ dx)$$ I'm not really sure where to start with this.  I can rewrite the equation as $(x^2 - y^2)\ d(xy) = 2x^3y\ d(y/x)$ and solve for one of the differentials, but not in a way where I can integrate the RHS.  I noticed that $x\ dy + y\ dx$ is cleanly expressible as a dot product, and since $d\vec r$ = $\begin{bmatrix}dx \\ dy\end{bmatrix}$ , integrating $d(xy)$ could be viewed as calculating work, where $\vec f(x,\ y) = \begin{bmatrix}y \\ x\end{bmatrix}$ .

What I am wondering if there is a way to solve the equation analytically and get a closed form curve as the solution.",,"['ordinary-differential-equations', 'partial-differential-equations', 'parametric', 'mathematica']"
99,How to get rid of the absolute value function when solving an ODE?,How to get rid of the absolute value function when solving an ODE?,,"Problem: $y'+yx=0, \quad y(0)=-1$ We separate it: $\frac{dy}{dx}=-yx \Rightarrow \int\frac{-1}{y}dy=\int x dx = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + C_1$ With $\int\frac{-1}{y}dy=\log(\frac{1}{|y|})+C_2$ we get $\log(\frac{1}{|y|})=\frac{1}{2}x^2 + C$ We solve for $y$: $|y|=e^{-\frac{1}{2}x^2}\cdot e^C=e^{-\frac{1}{2}x^2}\cdot \hat{C}$ Now, what is the best argumentation to get ""rid"" of $|\cdot |$?

Maybe I just don't get how $C$ can determine if we have the positive or negative solution or why we can't have both at the same time.  It just feels like I lack proper understanding to properly argument here.","Problem: $y'+yx=0, \quad y(0)=-1$ We separate it: $\frac{dy}{dx}=-yx \Rightarrow \int\frac{-1}{y}dy=\int x dx = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + C_1$ With $\int\frac{-1}{y}dy=\log(\frac{1}{|y|})+C_2$ we get $\log(\frac{1}{|y|})=\frac{1}{2}x^2 + C$ We solve for $y$: $|y|=e^{-\frac{1}{2}x^2}\cdot e^C=e^{-\frac{1}{2}x^2}\cdot \hat{C}$ Now, what is the best argumentation to get ""rid"" of $|\cdot |$?
