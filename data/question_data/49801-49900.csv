Let $I \subset \mathbb{R}$ be open and let $u': \overline{I} \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ be continuous.  Then for any $y \in I$, by the $L^1-L^\infty$ bound from Holder's inequality, we have: \begin{equation} |u(x)-u(y)|=\left|\int^x_y u'(z) \, dz \right| \leq \int^x_y \left| u'(z) \right| \, dz \leq \| u'\|_{L^{\infty}(\overline{I})} |x-y| \rightarrow 0 \quad \mbox{as } x \rightarrow y, \end{equation} so $u$ is continuous on $I$. The same argument can be used if $u' \in L^p(I)$ if $p \in (1,\infty]$.  However, I am unsure if it is still true if $u' \in L^1(I)$.  Can I still conclude that $u$ is continuous? Edit: fixing some errors in the question. Edit 2: We use a different argument.  The idea is to truncate $u'$ on smaller and smaller supports so that the resulting sequence $u_n'$ will tend to $0$ in the limit.  The proof is concluded by the dominated convergence theorem (DCT) because $u_n' \leq u'$. Fix $y \in I$.

Hence, the DCT implies that  \begin{equation} u(y+1/n)-u(y-1/n)\leq \int^{y+1/n}_{y-1/n} |u'(z)| \, dz = \int_I |u_n'(z)| \, dz \rightarrow  \int_I 0 \, dz=0. \end{equation} That is, for each $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists an $n_0 > 0$ such that $n\geq n_0$ implies $\int^{y+1/n}_{y-1/n} |u'(z)| \, dz < \varepsilon$.  Hence, for every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\delta:=1/n_0$ such that \begin{equation} |x-y| < \delta=1/n_0 \quad \mbox{implies} \quad |u(x)-u(y)|\leq  \int^{y+1/n}_{y-1/n} |u'(z)| \, dz<\varepsilon. \end{equation} As Copperhat notes, this actually shows that $v << \mu$ where $v$ is a measure with density $u' \in L^1$ and $\mu$ is the Lebesgue measure.","The primitive of a continuous function on a compact interval is continuous via the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

Motivation: The sum is part of a more elaborated solution of Eric Naslund of the integral: $$\int_0^{\infty } \text{sech}(z)\,\text{sech}(n\,z) \, dz = \frac{\pi}{2\, n} \sum _{k=0}^{n-1} (-1)^k \sec \left(\frac{\pi\, k}{n}+\frac{\pi }{2\,n}\right)+\frac{1}{2} \pi  \sec \left(\frac{\pi\, n}{2}\right)$$ which holds for any even number n. Attempt at a solution: There are some interesting papers, WEN CHANG CHU , Djurdje Cvijovic, H.M. Srivastava and HONGWEI CHEN , considering the summation of finite secant sums. Investigations of the first bibliographical reference lead to the closed form expression for the similar finite sum: $$\sum _{k=0}^n (-1)^k \sec \left(2 \left(\frac{\pi\,k}{n}+y\right)\right)=\frac{2\,n \,\sin \left(\frac{\pi\,n}{4}\right) \,\cos \left(\frac{n\,y}{2}\right)}{\cos (n\,y)-\cos \left(\frac{\pi\,n}{2}\right)}+\sec (y)$$ with $y = \frac{1}{2\,n}$ , which can be further investigated by: $$\sec (2\,z) = \frac{\sec ^2(z)}{2-\sec ^2(z)}$$ and $$\sec (\frac{z}{2})=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{\cos (z)+1}} (-1)^{\left\lfloor \frac{\pi +\Re(z)}{2 \pi }\right\rfloor } \left(1-\left((-1)^{\left\lfloor -\frac{\pi +\Re(z)}{2 \pi }\right\rfloor +\left\lfloor \frac{\pi +\Re(z)}{2 \pi }\right\rfloor }+1\right) \theta (-\Im(z))\right) $$ where $\Theta$ is the ""unitstep"" - function. In case of the last bibliographical reference, the main difference to the sum above is, that [HONGWEI CHEN], deals only with higher powers of a similar sum - but without that ""factor 2"" - e.g. $$S_{2 n}(\text{q})\text{:=}\sum _{p = 0\,\text{;}\,p\neq \frac{q}{2}  (\text{q is even})}^{q-1} \sec ^{2\, n}\left(\frac{\pi\,  p}{q}\right)$$ Another attempt at a solution is to write the sum as a ""q-series"" Dieckmann . EDIT A new approach is to split the sum e.g.  for $n=4,8,12,...$ [Claude Leibovici] $$\sum _{k=0}^{n-1} (-1)^k \sec \left(\frac{\pi  (2\,k+1)}{2\,n}\right)=2 \sum _{l=0}^{\frac{n}{4}-1} (-1)^l \sec \left(\frac{\pi \, (2\,l+1)}{2\,n}\right)-2 \sum _{l=0}^{\frac{n}{4}-1} (-1)^l \csc \left(\frac{\pi\,  (2\,l+1)}{2\,n}\right)$$ The summary of the preliminary work give some evidence that a closed -   form expression exists: The finite sum can be simplified to: $$S_{n}=\sum _{k=0}^{n-1} (-1)^k \sec \left(\frac{\pi\,k}{n}+\frac{\pi }{2\,n}\right)=2 \,\sum _{k=0}^{\frac{n}{2}-1} \sec \left(\frac{2\,\pi\,k}{n}+\frac{\pi}{2\,n}\right)$$ For the proof one has to split the sum in even and odd ""k's"". From expressions of the first bibliographical reference and the help of Dieckmann the following identity can be proven: $$W_{n}=\sum _{k=0}^n \frac{1}{\cos \left(\frac{2\, \pi\,  k}{n}\right)+z}=\frac{ n \,\cot \left(\frac{n}{4}\, \left(2\, \sin^{-1}(z)+\pi \right)\right)}{\sqrt{1-z^2}}+\frac{1}{z+1}$$ From the proof of the main result of [HONGWEI CHEN] one derive the further identity: $$V_{n}=\sum _{k=0}^n \frac{1}{\cos \left(\frac{\pi \, k}{n}\right)+z}=\frac{z}{z^2-1}-\frac{n \cot \left(n \cos ^{-1}(z)\right)}{\sqrt{1-z^2}}$$ Now we split the finite sum $W_{n}$ for even numbers n: $$W_{n}=\sum _{k=0}^{\frac{n}{2}} \frac{1}{\cos \left(\frac{2 \,\pi \, k}{n}\right)+z}+\sum _{k=\frac{n}{2}+1}^n \frac{1}{\cos \left(\frac{2\,\pi \,k}{n}\right)+z}$$ We express the first sum of $W_{n}$ by $V_{n}$ and solve for the last sum. This leads to: $$S_{z,w,n}=2 \sum _{k=0}^{n-1} \frac{1}{z-\cos \left(\frac{\pi \, k}{n}+\frac{\pi}{w\,n}\right)}$$ For $w=1$ we have: $$S_{z,1,n}=\frac{2\, n \,\left(\cot \left(n \cos ^{-1}(z)\right)+2\, \cot \left(\frac{1}{2} \,n \,\left(2 \,\sin ^{-1}(z)+\pi \right)\right)\right)}{\sqrt{1-z^2}}+\frac{2}{1-z^2}$$ The limit $\lim_{z\to 0}$ and $w=4$ gives the solution. With other words we need a general expression, dependent of $w$ , with $S_{z,1,n}$ for $w=1$ . EDIT II Mathematica can find a solution expressed in closed form using the q-polygamma function: $$S_{\frac{n}{2}}=\frac{2\,n}{\pi } \left(\psi _{e^{-\frac{i\,\pi}{n}}}\left(\frac{1}{4}-\frac{n}{2}\right)-2\, \psi _{e^{-\frac{i\,\pi }{n}}}\left(\frac{1}{4}+\frac{n}{2}\right)+\psi_{e^{-\frac{i\,\pi }{n}}}\left(\frac{1}{4}+\frac{3\,n}{2}\right)\right)$$ where $\psi _q(z)$ is the q-polygamma function. With the function ""FunctionExpand"" Mathematica expands the q-polygamma function with the complex argument and one can verify the radicals of [Vepir].

One day, my friend sent me this funny photo , from the photo we can easily know that glass beer = $10$ , burger = $5$ , and cup beer = $2$ , and the next part is the challenging part. From the integral question provided, we know that we need to do $$\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{10\sin x}{2x}dx$$ where it means $5\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\sin x}{x}dx$ after simplifying, but the problem is how to integrate it. After searching online, I realized that $\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\sin x}{x}dx$ is simply $\frac{\pi}{2}$ , so the answer is $\frac{5\pi}{2}$ . But why?! I am a person with a lot of curiosity haha and after searching online, I found out that lot of people use Laplace transforms or Feynman's Technique (by blackpenredpen which is a yt channel I like so much), but I don’t really understand those with my current knowledge. Then, I suddenly thought of a thing; can I do a Taylor series expansion, integrate it, and then find out where it converges? For example, $\sin x = \sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty}(-1)^{n}\frac{x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}$ , when you divide it by $x$ , it is $\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty}(-1)^{n}\frac{x^{2n}}{(2n+1)!}$ , and after you integrate it, it is $\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty}(-1)^{n}\frac{x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)(2n+1)!}$ . But what's next, here is where I am currently stucking at. I found out that this formula is actually a bit like the taylor series of $\arctan $ , just need to remove the $(2n+1)!$ and they are the same. When you $\lim_{x\to \infty}$ , their answers are both $\frac{\pi}{2}$ .

I'm trying to use complex methods to solve the integral, but I keep finding an answer of 0 owing to the lack of residues. I suspect that I'm not being careful enough about divergences and phase, and please point out if you see a mistake in the comments. Here's my work so far: $$I = \Re \Big(\int_{-\infty}^\infty dx \sin(ax) \log\Big(\frac{x+1}{x-1} \Big) \Big)$$ I justify this line since removing the absolute value bars merely adds a finite imaginary component from the integral between $-1 < x < 1$.

Next, I substitute $x \rightarrow -x$ in the second integral, and I find $$I = -\frac{1}{2}\Re \Big(i\int_{-\infty}^\infty dx\, e^{iax}\, \Big(\log\Big(\frac{x+1}{x-1}\Big)-\log\Big(\frac{-x+1}{-x-1} \Big) \Big).$$ Combining the logarithms yields $$I = -\Re \Big(i\int_{-\infty}^\infty dx\, e^{iax} \log\Big(\frac{x+1}{x-1}\Big) \Big).$$ The line above is where I wonder if some subtlety of the phase of the arguments of the logarithm was lost on me. In particular, I find that if I should have an extra '$\pi i $' added onto the logarithm, I would have the anticipated result.  Continuing nonetheless, to evaluate the integral $J \equiv \int_{-\infty}^\infty dx\, e^{iax} \log\Big(\frac{x+1}{x-1}\Big)$, I choose to evaluate $$K \equiv \oint dz\, e^{iaz} \log\Big(\frac{z+1}{z-1}\Big) $$ on the semicircle contour in the UHP, pictured below. I do not believe the branch cut I chose matters too much, since I chose the cut along the x-axis, but it could be that this choice of branch was somehow inconsistent with how I handled merging the logarithms above. The shrinking semi-circles about -1 and 1 contribute nothing. There aren't any residues inside, so $K=0$. Thus my integral $J$ must be equal to the upper arc as $R$ goes to infinity. Along the upper arc, note that taking the radius $R$ of the arc outward sends $\log\Big(\frac{z+1}{z-1}\Big) \rightarrow 0 $ as $\frac{1}{R}$.

My question is did I develop a bad habit by never changing the limits of integration, or is it a best practice to always change limits of integration?

I have seen that some people jump over this question by defining the function in an arbitrary way, $0$ for example, on the set of numbers where it is not defined. But this seems wrong to me, since then you are modifying the domain, and therefore integrating a different function, not the original one. My confusion increases, because it seems to me that the $f$ might be Darboux integrable, without the need of defining the function in the set $A$ . But I have read that Riemann and Darboux are equivalent. Any help would be welcome.

99,Is integration by substitution always the reverse chain rule?,Is integration by substitution always the reverse chain rule?,,"I understand that integration by substitution can be justified in the following way. If $I=\int f'(g(x))g'(x) \, dx$ then $I=f(g(x))+C$ . If we make the substitutions $$ u=g(x) \text{ and } du=g'(x)dx $$ then $I$ becomes $\int f'(u)du=f(u)+C=f(g(x))+C$ , which is the same. However, I often see substitutions that don't seem to take this form.
