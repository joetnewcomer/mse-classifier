1,"Find the number of collections of $16$ distinct subsets of $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$ with the some specific property",Find the number of collections of  distinct subsets of  with the some specific property,"16 \{1,2,3,4,5\}","Find the number of collections of $16$ distinct subsets of $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$ with the property that for any two subsets $X$ and $Y$ in the collection, $X \cap Y \not= \emptyset$ Solution given: Denote by $\mathcal C$ a collection of 16 distinct subsets of $\left\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \right\}$ . Denote $N = \min \left\{ |S|: S \in \mathcal C \right\}$ . Case 1: $N = 0$ . This entails $\emptyset \in \mathcal C$ . Hence, for any other set $A \in \mathcal C$ , we have $\emptyset \cap A = \emptyset$ . This is infeasible. Case 2: $N = 1$ . Let $\{a_1\} \in \mathcal C$ . To get $\{a_1\} \cap A \neq \emptyset$ for all $A \in \mathcal C$ . We must have $a_1 \in \mathcal A$ . The total number of subsets of $\left\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \right\}$ that contain $a_1$ is $2^4 = 16$ . Because $\mathcal C$ contains 16 subsets. We must have $\mathcal C = \left\{ \{a_1\} \cup A : \forall \ A \subseteq \left\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \right\} \backslash \left\{a_1 \right\} \right\}$ . Therefore, for any $X, Y \in \mathcal C$ , we must have $X \cap Y \supseteq \{a_1\}$ . So this is feasible. Now, we count the number of $\mathcal C$ in this case. We only need to determine $a_1$ . Therefore, the number of solutions is 5. Case 3: $N = 2$ . Case 3.1: There is exactly one subset in $\mathcal C$ that contains 2 elements. Denote this subset as $\left\{ a_1, a_2 \right\}$ . We then put all subsets of $\left\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \right\}$ that contain at least three elements into $\mathcal C$ , except $\left\{ a_3, a_4, a_5 \right\}$ . This satisfies $X \cap Y \neq \emptyset$ for any $X, Y \in \mathcal C$ . Now, we count the number of $\mathcal C$ in this case. We only need to determine $\left\{ a_1, a_2 \right\}$ . Therefore, the number of solutions is $\binom{5}{2} = 10$ . Case 3.2: There are exactly two subsets in $\mathcal C$ that contain 2 elements. They must take the form $\left\{ a_1, a_2 \right\}$ and $\left\{ a_1, a_3 \right\}$ . We then put all subsets of $\left\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \right\}$ that contain at least three elements into $\mathcal C$ , except $\left\{ a_3, a_4, a_5 \right\}$ and $\left\{ a_2, a_4, a_5 \right\}$ . This satisfies $X \cap Y \neq \emptyset$ for any $X, Y \in \mathcal C$ . Now, we count the number of $\mathcal C$ in this case. We only need to determine $\left\{ a_1, a_2 \right\}$ and $\left\{ a_1, a_3 \right\}$ . Therefore, the number of solutions is $5 \cdot \binom{4}{2} = 30$ . Case 3.3: There are exactly three subsets in $\mathcal C$ that contain 2 elements. They take the form $\left\{ a_1, a_2 \right\}$ , $\left\{ a_1, a_3 \right\}$ , $\left\{ a_1, a_4 \right\}$ . We then put all subsets of $\left\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \right\}$ that contain at least three elements into $\mathcal C$ , except $\left\{ a_3, a_4, a_5 \right\}$ , $\left\{ a_2, a_4, a_5 \right\}$ , $\left\{ a_2, a_3, a_5 \right\}$ .

We then put all subsets of $\left\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \right\}$ that contain at least three elements into $\mathcal C$ , except $\left\{ a_3, a_4, a_5 \right\}$ , $\left\{ a_2, a_4, a_5 \right\}$ , $\left\{ a_1, a_4, a_5 \right\}$ .

Putting all subcases together, the number of solutions is this case is $10 + 30 + 20 + 10 + 5 = 75$ . Case 4: $N \geq 3$ . The number of subsets of $\left\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \right\}$ that contain at least three elements is $\sum_{i=3}^5 \binom{5}{3} = 16$ . Because $\mathcal C$ has 16 elements, we must select all such subsets into $\mathcal C$ . Therefore, the number of solutions in this case is 1.

2,Struggling to intuitively understand the Factorial formula,Struggling to intuitively understand the Factorial formula,,"I understand that factorial represents the total number of possible ways to arrange $n$ number of items and it is calculated as $n\cdot(n-1)...\cdot2\cdot1$ . I don't understand though how this formula can be derived by using just the knowledge of multiplication. Consider the example of having 4 chocolates $A, B, C$ and $D$ and finding the number of possible ways of arranging them together. The answer for this is $4\cdot3\cdot2\cdot1=24$ but I don't understand in the context of this example, what $4\cdot3$ actually means. Does it mean that there are 4 possible candidates out of $A, B, C$ and $D$ for the first position and for the second position, there are 3 possible candidates so with one out of those 3 candidates matches with the 4 possible candidates for the first position and forms $4$ arrangements. So if you can form 4 arrangements with 1 of 3 candidates, then you can form $4\cdot3=12$ arrangements with 2 out of 4 chocolates. But the idea of forming 4 arrangements with a single candidate for the second position does not seem correct because one of those four arrangements will be a candidate with itself ( $AA$ for example) and that makes no sense. So this is the wrong way to think about it. So what is the correct way to think about the meaning of $4\cdot3$ in this context? Do we say that 1 out of 4 candidates for the first position goes along with 3 candidates for the second position, so with 2 out of 4 chocolates, we can form $3\cdot 4 = 12$ candidates? How do we proceed from here to the step of $(3\cdot4)\cdot2$ ? What does $(12)\cdot2$ practically mean? Does it mean we have possible candidates to pick from and with a single candidate we can have 12 arrangements of 3 chocolates and with 2 candidates, we can have $12 \cdot 2 = 24$ arrangements of 3 chocolates?

3,Does there exist an infinite set admitting precisely four linear orders?,Does there exist an infinite set admitting precisely four linear orders?,,"I am studying a course on ZF Set Theory where I encountered the following question: Does there exist a set admitting precisely four linear orders? Since any set with $n$ elements exhibits $n!$ linear orders, it feels obvious to conclude that there does not exist such a set since $n! \neq 4$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ (certainly not a finite set). However, I was wondering if there is a proof (or counterexample) for the claim that is more rigorous than this observation. The question seemed to be posed as more than just a trivial consequence of this fact and so I am assuming that I have oversimplified the problem and that if I broaden my consideration to infinite sets, then it becomes potentially a lot more tricky to conclude that the statement is incorrect in such a simple manner. I would be grateful for any clarity here. Further Thoughts Having now entertained the possibility of constructing infinite sets that exhibit precisely four linear orders, I have tentatively come up with an example that I think might work ( edit: this does not work). Perhaps if we define the set $$X := \mathbb{Z} \times \{ 1,2,3,4 \}$$ Then we can define the following four linear orders: $$ \text{Order 1: $(a, i) <_1 (b, j)$ if and only if $a < b$ or ($a = b$ and $i < j$)}$$ $$ \text{Order 2: $(a, i) <_2 (b, j)$ if and only if $a > b$ or ($a = b$ and $i < j$)}$$ $$ \text{Order 3: $(a, i) <_3 (b, j)$ if and only if $i < j$ or ($i = j$ and $a < b$)}$$ $$ \text{Order 4: $(a, i) <_4 (b, j)$ if and only if $i < j$ or ($i = j$ and $a > b$)}$$ However, I am hesitant to accept this as an answer without first showing that these are indeed the only four possible linear orders here (since the question requires that there are precisely four). It's certainly the case that four is a lower bound here, but how do I show that there are no others (if indeed this is the case)? Edit The above example is not correct. Please refer to the answer I have produced below for the reason why that is the case.

This problem concerns lists of length 6 made from the letters A,B,C,D,E,F, without repetition. How many such lists have the property that the D occurs before the A? I solved it, correctly, as follows: The case when D appears first in the list: $ \underline{1} \; \underline{5} \; \underline{4} \; \underline{3} \; \underline{2} \; \underline{1} = 120 $ The case when D appears second in the list: $\underline{4} \; \underline{1} \; \underline{4} \; \underline{3} \; \underline{2} \; \underline{1} = 96$ The case when D appears third in the list: $ \underline{4} \; \underline{3} \; \underline{1} \; \underline{3} \; \underline{2} \; \underline{1} = 72 $ The case when D appears fourth in the list: $\underline{4} \; \underline{3} \; \underline{2} \; \underline{1} \; \underline{2} \; \underline{1} = 48 $ The case when D appears fifth in the list: $  \underline{4} \; \underline{3} \; \underline{2} \; \underline{1} \; \underline{1} \; \underline{1} = 24 $ The sum is the answer: $ 120 + 96 + 72 + 48 + 24 = 360 $ However, the correct answer (that relates to combinations) is as follows: Begin with six blank spaces and select two of these spaces.

It contains all the points in $\text{conv}\{ 1_S: S\subset[n], |S|=k \}$ i.e., the convex hull of all binary $n$ -dimensional vectors with $k$ nonzero entries. My question is, for any given hypercube point $\mathbf{x} \in [0,1]^n$ (whose coordinates sum to $k$ ), how can we express the coordinates of that point in terms of the corners of a $(n,k)$ -hypersimplex (for arbitrarily chosen $k$ )?

98,Counting bit strings with given numbers of higher-order bit flips,Counting bit strings with given numbers of higher-order bit flips,,"Background information Bit flips Given a bit string, we say that bit flip happens when $0$ changes to $1$ or $1$ changes to $0$ . To find bit flips, we can shift the string by $1$ and xor that new string with the original one. The resulting string will have $1$ in the positions where bit flips happened in the original bit string. Having this new representation, we can repeat this operation to get the number of bit flips on the bit string of bit flips. It somewhat resembles the second derivative (because we track the change of the change). Let's call it the second-order bit flip . Let's consider the following example: $$ 01010001 $$ It's bit flip representation is: $$ 1111001 $$ Then the second order bit flip representation is: $$ 000101 $$ Counting the number of $1$ s in every bit string above gives us the number of ones in the original bit string $k = 3$ , the number of bit flips $m_1 = 5$ , and the number of second-order bit flips $m_2 = 2$ . Counting bit strings with a certain number of bit flips Now let's say we have a bit string of length $n$ with $k$ ones and $m$ bit flips. Can we count the number of such strings? Let's call this $A(n,k,m)$ . Bit flips split the whole sequence into $m+1$ blocks, each filled with only $1$ s or $0$ s. Also a block of $1$ s has to be followed by a block of $0$ s. Depending on whether $m$ is even or odd, the number of blocks for $1$ s and $0$ s is either equal or differs by exactly $1$ . Now, let's say that $m = 2m' + 1$ , then we need to split our $1$ s and $0$ s into exactly $m' + 1$ blocks each. This can be done via $\binom{k - 1}{m'}$ for $1$ s and $\binom{n-k-1}{m'}$ for $0$ s. We have 2 ways of choosing the first block. Putting it all together: $$ A(n,k,2m'+1) = 2\binom{k - 1}{m'}\binom{n - k - 1}{m'} $$ For $m = 2m'$ , we have $m' + 1$ blocks of one kind and $m'$ blocks of another kind. Choosing whether $1$ or $0$ s get more blocks determines the very first block. Putting it all together: $$ A(n,k,2m') = \binom{k - 1}{m' + 1}\binom{n - k - 1}{m'} + \binom{k - 1}{m'}\binom{n - k - 1}{m' + 1} $$ Because of the nature of these counts, we can also say that: $$ \sum\limits_{m=0}^{n} A(n,k,m) = \binom{n}{k} $$ The actual problem Counting bit strings with a certain number of second-order bit flips Extending the previous problem to include second-order bit flips, we can now say that we have $m_1$ bit flips and $m_2$ second-order bit flips and we want to find $B(n,k,m_1,m_2)$ , i.e. the number of bit strings of length $n$ with $k$ ones, $m_1$ bit flips and $m_2$ second-order bit flips. Again, we can expect that: $$ \sum\limits_{i=0}^{n} B(n,k,m,i) = A(n,k,m) $$ I tried writing a recurrence for this problem and solve it via generating functions: Finding coefficient in a complex multivariable generating function . However, the complexity of the intermediate steps is quite hard and I abandoned that route (there are might be tricks that I'm not aware of that can make it easier). I'd really appreciate any insights into how to solve this family of problems. Of course, it would be amazing to find a closed form solution for the N-order bit flips: $F(n,k,m_1,...,m_N)$ , but any pointers are welcome. Many thanks in advance! PS I might have reinvented some terms, so please correct me if you spotted familiar concepts.","Background information Bit flips Given a bit string, we say that bit flip happens when changes to or changes to .
