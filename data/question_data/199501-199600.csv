We need $x=0$ but no point of this kind is on the curve in this chart. Since $f$ gives us the first coordinate $x$ , we see that $y^3= \frac{-1-x^4}{x}$ gives us a ramification point iff $RHS=0$ ie we find $4$ ramification points of index 3.

We get that the curve is $x^4 + x +z^4=0$ and $f=\frac X Z = \frac X Y \cdot \frac Y Z = \frac x z = \frac {-z^3}{x^3+1}$ using the curve, thus $P$ is a zero of order 3 and $Q_i$ are 3 poles of order 1. Hurwirz Formula states: $$2n + 2g - 2= \sum_{p \in C}(e_p(f)-1).$$ We set $n=3$ because we found $3$ poles, and $RHS=3(1-1)+(3-1)+4\cdot (3-1)$ for the $3$ simple poles, a zero of order 3 and 4 points of ramification.

1,Differential of flow related to gradient Ricci soliton on $S^2$,Differential of flow related to gradient Ricci soliton on,S^2,"I'm confused by a claim made in Brendle's Ricci Flow and the Sphere Theorem on page 37. Let $(S^2,g)$ be a gradient Ricci soliton with soliton function $f:S^2\to\Bbb R$. Since the sphere is $2$-dimensional, we have  $$\nabla^2f=(\rho-\tfrac{1}{2}s)g,$$ where $\nabla$ is the LC connection, $s$ is the scalar curvature, and $\rho$ is a constant. Let $J$ be an almost complex structure compatible with $g$, i.e. $(x,y)\mapsto g(x,Jy)$ is a symplectic form, $g(Jx,Jy)=g(x,y)$, and $\nabla J=0$. Letting $\xi$ be the gradient of $f$ wrt. $g$, we have that $J\xi$ is a Killing field and its flow $\varphi_t$ is a one-parameter group of isometries. Let $p\in S^2$ be a critical point of $f$ and let $a=\rho-\tfrac{1}{2}s(p)$, so that  $$\tag{1}(\nabla^2 f)_p(v,v)=a|v|^2.$$ The author claims this implies $$\tag{2}(\mathrm d\varphi_t)_p(v)=\cos(at)v+\sin(at)Jv,$$ for all $t\in\Bbb R$ and $v\in T_pS^2$, which I am having a very hard time seeing. Since $p$ is a critical point $J\xi_p=0$, and $\varphi_t(p)=p$. We also have $g(v,Jv)=\omega(v,v)=0$, i.e. $v\bot Jv$ and are thus linearly independent. So we may write $$(\mathrm d\varphi_t)_pv=\alpha(t)v+\beta(t)Jv,$$ for smooth functions $\alpha,\beta:\Bbb R\to\Bbb R$. Furthermore, since $\varphi_t$ is an isometry, we have  \begin{align*}g(v,v)&=g((\mathrm d\varphi_t)_p(v),(\mathrm d\varphi_t)_p(v))\\ &=g(\alpha v+\beta Jv,\alpha v+\beta Jv)\\ &=\alpha^2 g(v,v)+2\alpha\beta g(v,Jv)+\beta^2g(Jv,Jv)\\ &=(\alpha^2+\beta^2)g(v,v)\implies \alpha^2(t)+\beta^2(t)=1.\end{align*} Clearly $\alpha(0)=1$ and $\beta(0)=0$. To get sine and cosine, it seems like one should derive the ODEs $\alpha''=-a^2\alpha$ and $\beta''=-a^2\beta$ with the correct initial values from $(1)$, but I don't know how to do that. Taking the derivative of $\alpha^2+\beta^2=1$ gives $\alpha\alpha'+\beta\beta'=0$, whence $\alpha'(0)=0$. Let $c(t)=\alpha(t)v+\beta(t)Jv$. Then $t\mapsto g(c(t),c(t))$ is a constant function, so $g(c',c)=0$. This fixes $c'=-k\beta v+k\alpha Jv$, where $k$ is a constant. Thus $ \alpha'=-k\beta$ and $\beta'=k\alpha$. Thus $\beta'(0)=k$ and we get $c''=-k^2c$. Together with the initial values, this gives $c(t)=\cos(kt)v+\sin(kt)Jv$. How does one see that $a=k$?

7,Minimizing curves are geodesics,Minimizing curves are geodesics,,"Let $(M,g)$ be a Riemannian manifold. I want to prove the following claim: Let $c:[0,1]\to M$ be a smooth curve from $p$ to $q$ such that $L(c)=d(p,q)$. Then $c$ is, up to reparametrization, a geodesic. And I can use the following: Fact: For each $p\in M$ there exists a $\delta>0$ such that for every $q,q'\in B_\delta(p)$, there exists a unique minimizing geodesic from $q$ to $q'$. Some observations: $c$ not only minimizes the distance from $p$ to $q$ but in fact between any two points on the curve: If that were not the case, then we would have $L(\tilde c)<L(c|_{[s,t]})$ for some other curve $\tilde c$ from $c(s)$ to $c(t)$. From that we obtain $L(c|_{[0,s]}\cup \tilde{c}\cup c|_{[t,1]})<L(c)$, contradicting the assumption that $c$ is minimizing. The curve $c$ can be covered by finitely many balls of some radius $\delta>0$ as in the fact above.

Then $c$ is, up to reparametrization, a geodesic. And I can use the following: Fact: For each $p\in M$ there exists a $\delta>0$ such that for every $q,q'\in B_\delta(p)$, there exists a unique minimizing geodesic from $q$ to $q'$. Some observations: $c$ not only minimizes the distance from $p$ to $q$ but in fact between any two points on the curve: If that were not the case, then we would have $L(\tilde c)<L(c|_{[s,t]})$ for some other curve $\tilde c$ from $c(s)$ to $c(t)$. From that we obtain $L(c|_{[0,s]}\cup \tilde{c}\cup c|_{[t,1]})<L(c)$, contradicting the assumption that $c$ is minimizing. The curve $c$ can be covered by finitely many balls of some radius $\delta>0$ as in the fact above.

Then this means there exists some $(p,q)\in S$ such that $(p,q)\in p\times N$, thus $\pi_M|_S$ is surjective, and it must be injective since $\iota^{-1}(p\times N)$ is a singleton. The transversality condition implies $$ T_{(p,q)}(p\times N)+d\iota_{(p,q)}(T_{(p,q)}S)\simeq T_{(p,q)}N+T_{(p,q)}(S)=T_{(p,q)}(M\times N) $$ so necessarily $\dim(T_{(p,q)}(S))\geq m$, by dimension considerations. As a bijection, it's enough to show $\pi_M|_S$ is either of constant rank, or a local diffeomorphism to prove it's a diffeomorphism. As a projection map, I feel like it should be a submersion onto $M$, and that would do the trick. Note: This is Theorem 6.32 in John Lee's Intro to Smooth Manifolds.",,"['differential-geometry', 'manifolds', 'differential-topology', 'smooth-manifolds']"
32,Vanishing pushforward implies smooth function is locally constant?,Vanishing pushforward implies smooth function is locally constant?,,"I'm trying to prove that if the pushforward $dF$ of a smooth map $F\colon M\to N$ between smooth manifolds is zero, then $F$ is constant on each component.

So $\hat{F}$ has vanishing Jacobian at $\hat{p}$, which is the coordinate representative of $p$. Does this imply that $\hat{F}$ is locally constant at $\hat{p}$ for some reason?

To make things more precise I'll give the relevant definitions. Note that $\mathcal{H}^k$ denotes the $k$ -dimensional Hausdorff measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathcal{L}_n$ denotes Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$ . Definition. (Approximate tangent space) Let $E\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ be a $\mathcal{H}^k$ -measurable set such that $\mathcal{H}^k(E\cap K)<\infty$ for all compact $K\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ . and let $P$ be a $k$ -dimensional subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$ . We say that $P$ is the approximate tangent space of $E$ at $x\in E$ if $$\lim_{\lambda\downarrow0}\int_{\frac{E-x}{\lambda}}f~\mathrm{d}\mathcal{H}^k=\int_P f~\mathrm{d}\mathcal{H}^k$$ for all compactly supported continuous $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$ . Definition. (Tangent space) Let $M$ be a $k$ -dimensional $C^1$ -submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^n$ , and let $x\in M$ . We define the tangent space of $M$ at $x$ , denoted $\mathrm{T}_xM$ , as the subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$ consisting of all vectors $v$ such that $v=\gamma'(0)$ for some $C^1$ -curve $\gamma:(-1,1)\to M$ with $\gamma(0)=x$ . What I am trying to prove is that if $M$ is a $k$ -dimensional $C^1$ -submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^n$ , then $\mathrm{T}_xM$ is also the approximate tangent space of $M$ at $x$ . In particular then what I need to show is that $$\lim_{\lambda\downarrow0}\int_{\frac{M-x}{\lambda}}f~\mathrm{d}\mathcal{H}^k=\int_{\mathrm{T}_xM} f~\mathrm{d}\mathcal{H}^k$$ for all compactly supported continuous $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$ . Before giving my attempt, I'll also state the Area formula, which I'm using. Theorem. (Area formula) Let $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^m$ be Lipschitz, where $n\leq m$ , and let $g\in\mathscr{L}^1(\mathbb{R}^n)$ . Then $$\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}gJf~\mathrm{d}\mathcal{L}_n=\int_{\mathbb{R}^m}\sum_{x\in f^{-1}(\{y\})}g(x)~\mathrm{d}\mathcal{H}^n(y),$$ where $$Jf(x)=\sqrt{\det(Df(x)^*\circ Df(x))},$$ with $^*$ denoting the adjoint. The following is what I've tried so far: We consider first when we can parameterize all of $M$ by a $C^1$ -map $\psi:V\to M$ on some open set $V\subseteq\mathbb{R}^k$ . Suppose without loss of generality that $\psi(0)=x$ . We have that $$\mathrm{T}_xM=\mathrm{span}\{\partial_1\psi(0),\dots,\partial_k\psi(0)\},$$ and so in particular we can consider the function $h:\mathbb{R}^k\to\mathrm{T}_xM$ defined by $$h(y)=D\psi(0)y,$$ which gives us an isomorphism, and in particular $h$ is Lipschitz with $$Jh(y)=J\psi(0)$$ for all $y\in\mathbb{R}^k$ , and so by the Area formula we have that $$\int_{\mathrm{T}_xM} f~\mathrm{d}\mathcal{H}^k=\int_{\mathbb{R}^k}f(D\psi(0)y)J\psi(0)~\mathrm{d}\mathcal{L}_k(y).$$ Now take $\lambda>0$ , define $\eta_\lambda:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^n$ by $$\eta_\lambda(y)=\frac{y-x}{\lambda},$$ and observe that $\eta_\lambda\circ\psi$ then parameterizes $\frac{M-x}{\lambda}$ , and $$J(\eta_\lambda\circ\psi)=\frac{1}{\lambda^k}J\psi.$$ We thus have, again by the Area formula, that $$\int_{\frac{M-x}{\lambda}} f~\mathrm{d}\mathcal{H}^k=\int_V f\left(\frac{\psi(y)-x}{\lambda}\right)\frac{J\psi(y)}{\lambda^k}~\mathrm{d}\mathcal{L}_k(y).$$ At this point I suppose I want to let $\lambda\downarrow0$ and use some convergence theorem to show that this integral converges to the previous one. I am however stuck on how to actually do this, and so need help on how to progress from here (assuming my idea even works and is correct so far). Edit: So I realized that if $y\neq0$ , then $\psi(y)\neq x$ , which means that $\frac{\psi(y)-x}{\lambda}$ is outside of the support of $f$ for sufficiently small $\lambda$ .

I wonder if anyone has defined a kind of ""fractal variety/manifold"" that considers fractal geometries that are not explicitly constructions within a Euclidean space and in some sense can be analyzed intrinsically as are differentiable manifolds.",m,"['differential-geometry', 'analytic-geometry', 'fractal-analysis']"

If $Z$ is a vector field on $M$ , denote its horizontal lift by $\tilde{Z}$ . Now, consider a curve $\gamma$ on $M$ starting at $p$ . We can lift this curve to a horizontal curve $\tilde\gamma$ starting at some $\tilde{p}\in\pi^{-1}(p)$ - essentially by lifting the velocity vector field of $\gamma$ pointwise via the isomorphism $\mathrm{d}\pi_{\tilde{p}}|_{H_{\tilde{p}}}\colon H_{\tilde{p}}\to T_{\pi(\tilde{p})}M$ and then solving the flow equation by Picard-Lindelöff. If V is a vector (tensor) field along $\gamma$ then we can also lift it to a vector (tensor) field $\tilde{V}$ along $\tilde{\gamma}$ by attaching to each $\tilde{\gamma}(t)$ the vector (tensor) $\mathrm{d}\pi_{\tilde{\gamma}(t)}|_{H_{\tilde{\gamma}(t)}}^{-1}(V_{\gamma(t)})$ . Exercise 5.6 (b) in Lee's Riemannian manifolds shows that for lifts of vector fields $$ \tilde{\nabla}_{\tilde{X}}{\tilde{Y}} = \widetilde{\nabla_{X}{Y}} + \tfrac12[\tilde{X},\tilde{Y}]^{V} $$ where the superscript $V$ denotes the projection onto the vertical tangent bundle. Question 1: Is there a corresponding statement for the covariant derivative along $\gamma$ and its lift? If I can locally extend the vector field $\gamma^{\prime}$ and $V$ downstairs then I can use Lee's formula for the lifts. Of course, that's not always possible. So my guess would be $$ \tilde{D_t}{\tilde{V}} = \widetilde{D_t{V}} + \tfrac12[\tilde{\gamma}^{\prime},\tilde{V}]^{V} $$ but I don't know if a commutator of vector fields along a curve makes sense or how it acts on functions.

I'm not sure whether it's better placed here or on Overflow- it has the feeling of being very standard for the right person but I haven't done enough geometric measure theory to spot it. Happy to be prompted to migrate if it seems beyond scope. Setup: Let $f \in \mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_N]$ and assume the real part of the corresponding algebraic set $S$ defined as $\mathcal{V}(f)\cap\mathbb{R}^N$ is compact. If it helps, assume that it's smooth. Let $\epsilon > 0$ and suppose $x\in S$ , i.e. $f(x) = 0$ . Question: Let $B(x,\epsilon)$ be the Euclidean ball of radius $\epsilon$ around $x$ in $\mathbb{R}^N$ . Can we associate some geometric condition number $c(S)$ based on a well-known geometric quantity (e.g. extrinsic curvature) to $S$ and give a lower bound on the (N-1)-dimensional Hausdorff measure (in $\mathbb{R}^N$ ) of the set $ S \cap B(x,\epsilon)$ in terms of $c(S)$ ? This is related to a probability question: Given $x$ and $\epsilon$ , is there a somewhat satisfying lower bound on the probability you get a point within $\epsilon$ of $x$ when you sample from the uniform distribution on $S$ given by Hausdorff measure? It seems visually intuitive that this should depend on extrinsic curvature, but I can't quite get it there. An upper bound would also be nice, but that's going to be trickier and rely on the algebraic properties more (you need Bezout's Theorem at least to limit spirals, I think). The background: Diaconis et al. have a type of tutorial on these questions https://statweb.stanford.edu/~cgates/PERSI/papers/sampling11.pdf . In particular, Section 2.2 recalls the following area formula recorded in Federer's Geometric Measure Theory . It gives a formula for the Hausdorff measure of a set in terms of a parameterization. The following is a slightly weaker form of the result for conciseness. Theorem Let $\lambda^m$ denote the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}^m$ . If $u:\mathbb{R}^m\to\mathbb{R}^n$ is Lipschitz, $A\subseteq\mathbb{R}^m$ is $\lambda^m$ measurable, $u(A) = P$ , and $u$ is injective: $$ H^m(P) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} 1_P(y) H^m(dy) = \int_A J_m u(z) \lambda^m(dz) $$ where $J_m u(z)$ is the Jacobian $\sqrt{\det((Du(z)^T Du(z))}$ . In our context $P$ is our set $S\cap B(x,\epsilon)$ and we a priori don't know a parameterization $u:\mathbb{R}^{N-1}\to\mathbb{R}^N$ . The Implicit Function Theorem is standard for this, with the caveat that $\epsilon$ must be small enough. Assume for the sake of convenience that we can use the IFT on the last variable. We at least know that if $\epsilon$ is small enough we have a parameterization $u:U\to\mathbb{R}^N$ with $U\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{N-1}$ of the form $u(z) = (z,g(z))$ for some $g:\mathbb{R}^{N-1}\to\mathbb{R}$ . Furthermore, let $B=\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_N}(u(z)))^{-1}$ . Then $Du(z)$ is a matrix of the form $(I_{n-1} | (-B\hat\nabla_f(u(z)))^T$ where $\hat\nabla_f(u(z))$ is the first $n-1$ coordinates of $\nabla_f(u(z))$ . So $Du(z)^T Du(z) = I_{n-1} + B^2 \hat\nabla_f(u(z))\hat\nabla_f(u(z))^T$ . That's the best I have for now: There's probably some better way to write that matrix for the determinant, or even a better approach to the question.

It should be a very simple exercise, but I am swamped due to the amount of bookkeeping. I fear I am missing a very simple nuance that makes it impossible for me to solve this problem. I'll briefly mention the exercise below with the relevant notes from the lecture notes. The Exercise Exercise 20. Let $E \to M$ be a vector bundle equipped with the connection $\nabla$ . Let $\gamma = \gamma(t,s) \colon I_1 \times I_2 \to M$ be a smooth map defined on the product of two intervals $I_1, I_2 \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ and $u = u(t,s) \colon I_1 \times I_2 \to E$ a smooth covering. Show that $$ \frac{\nabla^2 u}{ds \, dt} - \frac{\nabla^2 u}{ds \, dt} = k_\nabla \left( \frac{d\gamma}{ds}, \frac{d\gamma}{dt} \right)(u), $$ where $k_\nabla$ in the induced curvature. Clarifying the notation Let me elucidate the notation $\frac\nabla{dt}$ and $\frac\nabla{ds}$ . If $\gamma \colon I \to M$ is a path, then we can use sections $s \in \Gamma(E)$ to produce smooth coverings $u = s \circ \gamma \colon I \to E$ .  This implies that the notation $$ \nabla_{\dot \gamma}(s)(\gamma(t))  $$ makes sense as you can view $\dot \gamma$ as a sort of vector field. We denote this as $$ \frac{\nabla(s \circ \gamma)}{dt}. $$ So more generally, we can define the operator $\frac{\nabla}{dt}$ to define a new path for smooth coverings of $\gamma$ $$ \frac{\nabla u}{dt} \colon I \to E. $$ Locally with respect to a frame $e = (e_j)_j$ , we may write $u(t) = \sum_j u^je_j(\gamma(t))$ . Then using formula (1.18) from these lecture notes, one may write the $i$ 'th component of $\frac{\nabla u}{dt}$ with respect to this frame as $$ \left( \frac{\nabla u}{dt} \right)^i = \frac{d u^i}{dt}(t) + \sum_j(t) \omega^i_j(\dot \gamma(t)). $$ Here $\omega = (\omega^i_j)$ represents the connection matrix, representing the one-forms that you obtain from the equation $\nabla_X(e_j) = \sum_i \omega_i^j(X) e_i$ . My strategy, my work and what I find hard For this exercise I had the following strategy in mind. I was planning to use the last formula twice:  twice to calculate $\frac{\nabla^2 u}{ds \, dt}$ and twice to calculate $\frac{\nabla^2 u}{dt \, ds}$ . From there I hoped it would resemble the local form of the curvature. What I find hard is the following: By applying that formula, you get a lot of terms, and I guess that my bookkeeping skills can't keep up at the moment. Maybe I am just going about it the wrong way. Here is my work until now. I also found it hard to properly express the local form of the curvature in terms of the connection: $k = d \omega + \omega \wedge \omega$ , where $(\omega \wedge \omega)^i_j = \sum_k \omega^i_k \wedge \omega^k_j$ is the local connection matrix. I was never able to prove this (maybe I should open a separate thread for this, but so be it). So am I missing an important nuance? Is this the right strategy?

Now let $(\tau_1(x),\ldots,\tau_k(x))$ denote the orthonormal basis of $T_x\:M$ obtaine from $(\sigma_1(x),\ldots,\sigma_k(x))$ by the Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization process for $x\in\Omega$ . Noting that this process does not decrease regularity and noting that $^1$ $$\left.\operatorname P_M\right|_\Omega=\sum_{i=1}^k\tau_i\otimes\tau_i\tag4,$$ we are done. Or did I made a mistake at some point? And how can we compute $T_x(\operatorname P_M)$ , $x\in M$ ? Regarding question 2 : Note that $$\nu_{\partial M}(x)\in T_x\:M\cap N_x\:\partial M\tag5\;\;\;\text{for all }x\in\partial M$$ and, by definition, the tangential differential of $f$ at $x\in\partial M$ in direction $v\in T_x\:M$ should be given by $$T_x(f)\left(v-\langle v,\nu_{\partial M}(x)\rangle\nu_{\partial M}(x)\right),\tag6$$ but in the special case $k=d$ , where $T_x\:M=\mathbb R^d$ . Now, if $(\Omega,\phi)$ and $(\tau_1(x),\ldots,\tau_k(x))$ are as above, $$T_x\:\partial M=T_x(\phi)^{-1}\partial\mathbb H^k\tag7$$ and hence $(\tau_1(x),\ldots,\tau_{k-1}(x))$ is an orthonormal basis of $T_x\:\partial M$ for all $x\in\partial\Omega$ . Let $x\in\partial\Omega$ . Since $\nu_{\partial M}(x)\in N_x\:\partial M=\left(T_x\:\partial M\right)^\perp$ , $$\langle\nu_{\partial M}(x),\tau_i(x)\rangle=0\;\;\;\text{for all }i\in\{1,\ldots,k-1\}\tag8$$ and it should follow that $(\tau_1(x),\ldots,\tau_{k-1}(x),\nu_{\partial M}(x))$ is an orthonormal basis of $T_x\:M$ . Moreover, for what it's worth, it should hold $$\tau_k(x)=\frac{\nu_{\partial M}(x)}{\left|\langle\nu_{\partial M}(x),\tau_k(x)\rangle\right|^2}\tag9.$$ In particular, it should hold $$\operatorname P_{\partial M}=\left.\operatorname P_M\right|_{\partial M}-\nu_{\partial M}\otimes\nu_{\partial M}\tag{10},$$ i.e. $\operatorname P_M(x)-\nu_{\partial M}(x)\otimes\nu_{\partial M}(x)$ should be the orthogonal projection of $\mathbb R^d$ onto $T_x\:\partial M$ and the tangential differential of $f$ at $x$ should be equal to $(1)$ . Did I made any mistake at some point? $^1$ As usual, $u\otimes v:=\langle\;\cdot\;,u\rangle v$ for $u,v\in\mathbb R^d$ .","Let , , , be a -dimensional embedded -submanifold of with boundary, denote the outward pointing unit normal field on and denote the orthogonal projection of onto the tangent space of at .
