But $\mathbb{K}[\mathbb{A}^1] \cong \mathbb{K}[t]$, whereas $\mathbb{K}[X] \cong \mathbb{K}[t^3,t^4,t^5]$ by considering the homomorphism $$\mathbb{K}[x,y,z] \rightarrow \mathbb{K}[t], \; x\rightarrow t^3, \; y\rightarrow t^4, \; z\rightarrow t^5$$ which has kernel $\mathbb{I}(X)$ and image $\mathbb{K}[t^3,t^4,t^5]$, so $$\mathbb{K}[X] \cong \mathbb{K}[x,y,z]/\mathbb{I}(X) \cong \mathbb{K}[t^3,t^4,t^5]$$ Thus we would have that $\mathbb{K}[t] \cong \mathbb{K}[t^3,t^4,t^5]$, but this is not the case since the former is a UFD, whilst the latter is not, since for example $t^8 = t^3t^5 = (t^4)^2$ has two factorisations. Hence, $\mathbb{A}^1 \ncong X$. Is this line of reasoning correct? Is there an easier way I could have gone about it?",,"['algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra', 'proof-verification']"

OK. 2) The category of simplicial presheaves $[\text{Sm}/S^{\text{op}}, \text{sSet}]$, denoted by $M_S$, has (at least) 3 local model structures, the injective (Jardine), the projective (Dugger, Hollander, Isaksen) and the flasque (Isaksen). The weak equivalences in these structures are the local weak equivalences, which can be characterized either by being the maps inducing isomorphisms on all sheaves of homotopy groups (Jardine), or the maps inducing isomorphisms on all stalks. These models can be seen as a left Bousfield localization of the global model structures. Similar models hold by restricting to simplicial sheaves instead of presheaves, and they are Quillen equivalent by sheafification-embedding.

Their model structure seems to be a left Bousfield localization of the category of simplicial sheaves at the unique map $\mathbb{A}^1 \to \ast$. Magically, all the projections $\mathbb{A}^1 \times F \to F \in M_S$ are weak equivalences ? So the localization can be formally done by apllying a left Bousfield localization ?

Now I am trying to show that $$ \mathcal{O}_{\operatorname{Proj}(S\times_A T)}\cong p_1^{*}\mathcal{O}_{\operatorname{Proj}(S)}\otimes p_2^{*}\mathcal{O}_{\operatorname{Proj}(T)} $$ where $p_1$ and $p_2$ are the structure maps making $\operatorname{Proj}(S\times_A T)$ the product of $\operatorname{Proj}(S)$ and $\operatorname{Proj}(T)$ . I'm stuck at the following very specific part of the proof: Is it true that $$ ((S\times_A T)(1))_{(f\otimes g)}\cong S(1)_{(f)}\otimes_{S_{(f)}}(S\times_A T)_{(f\otimes g)}\otimes_{T_{(g)}} T(1)_{(g)} $$ For all $f\in S_d$ and $g\in T_d$ where $d\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$ is arbitrary? I constructed a map going from right to left by mapping $s/f^n\otimes[(s'\otimes t')/(f\otimes g)^n]\otimes t/g^n$ to $((ss')\otimes (tt'))/(f\otimes g)^{2n}$ and showed that it is surjective. However, I'm struggling to prove that the map is injective. Edit: As suggested by KReiser, I tried to directly construct an inverse. However, I'm only able to do this under the extra assumption that $S$ and $T$ are generated by $S_1$ resp. $T_1$ as $A$ -algebras, so that we can assume that $f$ and $g$ are of degree $1$ . Here's why. To justify the well-definedness of the map $$ ((S\times_A T)(1))_{(f\otimes g)}\to S(1)_{(f)}\otimes_{S_{(f)}}(S\times_A T)_{(f\otimes g)}\otimes_{T_{(g)}}T(1)_{(g)}\\ (s\otimes t)/(f\otimes g)^n\mapsto (s/f^n)\otimes 1\otimes (t/g^n) $$ we would like to start by defining it on the homogeneous pieces of $(S\times_A T)(1)$ and then pass to the localisation. However, for this to work, we would have to relax the target to $S(1)_{f}\otimes_{S_{(f)}}(S\times_A T)_{f\otimes g}\otimes_{T_{(g)}}T(1)_{g}$ , and only afterwards show that the image is contained in $S(1)_{(f)}\otimes_{S_{(f)}}(S\times_A T)_{(f\otimes g)}\otimes_{T_{(g)}}T(1)_{(g)}$ , because otherwise, the map $$ s\otimes t\in (S\times_A T)(1)\mapsto (s/1)\otimes 1\otimes (t/1) $$ wouldn't be well-defined. So at this point we have a map of abelian groups $(S\times_A T)(1)\to S(1)_{f}\otimes_{S_{(f)}}(S\times_A T)_{f\otimes g}\otimes_{T_{(g)}}T(1)_{g}$ . Now to pass to the localisation on the source, as we have only a morphism of abelian groups at this point, we would have to justify by hand why it is well defined. That is, we want to show that if $(s\otimes t)/(f\otimes g)^n$ is equal to $0$ inside $(S\times_A T)(1)_{f\otimes g}$ , then $(s/1)\otimes 1\otimes (t/1)$ is $0$ inside $S(1)_{f}\otimes_{S_{(f)}}(S\times_A T)_{f\otimes g}\otimes_{T_{(g)}}T(1)_{g}$ . If we now suppose that $f$ and $g$ are of degree $1$ , then this can be done: if $e$ is the degree of $s$ and $t$ , then $$ (s/1)\otimes 1\otimes (t/1)=((s/f^{e+1})sf^{e+1})\otimes 1\otimes ((t/g^{e+1})tg^{e+1})=\\ =(sf^{e+1}/1)\otimes ((s\otimes t)/(f\otimes g)^{e+1})\otimes (tg^{e+1}/1)=0 $$ because of the middle term.

The proof boils down to showing that $C'$ is a regular integral affine curve $\operatorname{Spec}(A')$ and $C$ = $\operatorname{Spec}(A)$ , then for any maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ of $A'$ , $A_{\mathfrak{m}}$ is a free $A_{\mathfrak{m}}$ module. $A'_{\mathfrak{m}}$ is a DVR, so we may take a uniformiser $t$ and it suffices to prove the case where $t \in A'$ .

74,"Points at infinity of a conic section and its eccentricity, foci, and directrix?","Points at infinity of a conic section and its eccentricity, foci, and directrix?",,"Background on projective geometry and conic sections; you might want to skip to the actual question A conic section is analytically described as the zero-locus of points $(x,y)$ in the affine plane of a quadratic polynomial in two variables $x$ and $y$, i.e. the solutions to the equation $$Ax^2+Bxy+Cy^2+Dx+Ey+F=0$$ Geometrically, these are the sections obtained by intersecting, in $3$-dimensional affine space , the plane $z=1$ with the cone consisting of the solutions $(x,y,z)$ to the homogeneous quadratic equation $$Ax^2+Bxy+Cy^2+Dxz+Eyz+Fz^2=0$$ From a different point of view, the cone is composed not of points $(x,y,z)$ in $3$-dimensional space, but of lines through the origin $(0,0,0)$ in $3$-dimensional space. This is reflected by the homogeneity of the equation: if $(x,y,z)$ is a solution, then so is $(\lambda x,\lambda y,\lambda z)$ for any scalar $\lambda$. Since any line is determined by two distinct points it passes through, lines through the origin $(0,0,0)$ can be represented by homogeneous coordinates $[x,y,z]$ where not all of $x,y,z$ are zero. Each triple $[x,y,z]$ represents the line going through $(0,0,0)$, but two triples represent the same line if they differ by a scalar: i.e. $[x,y,z]$ and $[u,v,w]$ represent the same line if there exists a (non-zero) $\lambda$ such that $x=\lambda u$, $y=\lambda v$, and $z=\lambda w$. With homogeneous coordinates under our belt, we can define the projective plane to be the space of lines through the origin $(0,0,0)$ in $3$-dimensional affine space. Then we also have a cone in the projective plane given by the solutions $[x,y,z]$ to the homogeneous equation $$Ax^2+Bxy+Cy^2+Dxz+Eyz+Fz^2=0$$ For the purposes of this question, each point in the projective plane, i.e. line through the origin $(0,0,0)$ is one of two types: the lines $[x,y,z]$ with $z\neq 0$ (which intersect the plane $z=1$ in $3$-dimensional space) and the lines $[x,y,0]$ (which are parallel to the plane $z=1$ in $3$-dimensional space). The former can be identified by homogeneity with the lines $[x,y,1]$, so that each line determines a point in the affine plane and conversely each point in the affine plane determines a line. Thus, the conic section we started with is the intersection of the cone in projective space with the affine plane $z\neq0$. The latter points, of the form $[x,y,0]$ form the so-called line at infinity around our affine plane. The reason for this lies in how lines in the affine plane interact with points in projective space. A line in the affine plane consists of the solutions $(x,y)$ to an equation $$ax+by=c$$ Homogenizing this equation gives a homogeneous equation $$ax+by=cz$$ whose solutions $[x,y,z]$ determine a line in the projective plane . The line in the affine plane is the intersection of the line in the projective plane with the affine plane $z\neq0$, i.e., with the points of the projective plane with homogeneous coordinates $[x,y,1]$. On the other hand, the intersection of the line in the projective plane with the line at infinity is the intersections with points of the projective plane with homogeneous coordinates $[x,y,0]$. There is only one such intersection point, and that is the point $[-b,a,0]$ on the line at infinity. Since two lines in the affine plane are parallel if and only if their ratios $a:b$ are the same, we see that all lines in the affine plane parallel to the line given by $ax+by=c$ intersect the line at infinity at $[-b,a,0]$. Hence, the points $[x,y,0]$ on the line at infinity are precisely the point at infinity in which parallel lines intersect! Actual question It is natural to ask where does the conic section $$Ax^2+Bxy+Cy^2+Dx+Ey+F=0$$ intersect the line at infinity? Plugging in $z=0$ in the homogenized equation, we arrive at he solutions $[x,y,0]$ of the homogenized quadratic $$Ax^2+Bxy+Cy^2=0$$ Presuming we are not working in characteristic $2$, we can compute explicitly the solutions. In the case of real coefficients, the discriminant $B^2-4AC$ being positive, $0$, or negative corresponds to having two intersection points at infinity (hyperbola), one intersection point at infinity (parabola), or no intersection points at infinity (ellipse). Furthermore (still in the case of real coefficients), if the intersection points are actually $[1,\pm i,0]$ then the conic has to be circle (these are known as the circular points at infinity ). In particular, this exhibits the fact that all conic sections are uniquely determined by $5$ points as a generalization of the fact that a circle is uniquely determined by $3$ points since a circle is a conic section that has to go through the circular points at infinity. My question is whether we can give a definition of focus, directrix, and eccentricity using only the algbera-geometric structure of the projective plane, and not the usual metric definition. In particular, since the eccentricy governs (for real coefficients) whether the type of conic, it might be computable from the points at infinity.","Background on projective geometry and conic sections; you might want to skip to the actual question A conic section is analytically described as the zero-locus of points $(x,y)$ in the affine plane of a quadratic polynomial in two variables $x$ and $y$, i.e. the solutions to the equation $$Ax^2+Bxy+Cy^2+Dx+Ey+F=0$$ Geometrically, these are the sections obtained by intersecting, in $3$-dimensional affine space , the plane $z=1$ with the cone consisting of the solutions $(x,y,z)$ to the homogeneous quadratic equation $$Ax^2+Bxy+Cy^2+Dxz+Eyz+Fz^2=0$$ From a different point of view, the cone is composed not of points $(x,y,z)$ in $3$-dimensional space, but of lines through the origin $(0,0,0)$ in $3$-dimensional space.

83,Showing closed immersions are stable under base extension without using that they are affine.,Showing closed immersions are stable under base extension without using that they are affine.,,"This question is based on question $3.11$ from chapter $2$ of Hartshorne, found on page $92$. Part $a)$ of said question asks to show that closed immersions are stable under base extension. In other words, if $f:Y \rightarrow X$ is a closed immersions and $g:X'\rightarrow X$ a morphism of schemes, then the induced map $f':Z=Y\times_X X' \rightarrow X'$ is also a closed immersion. My question is: How can we prove this without using that a closed immersion is affine? I ask because although I can reduce to the case where $X'$ and $X$ are affine fairly easily, I have not been able to find a proof anywhere (including on related questions such as this one on the site) that doesn't use part $b)$ of the question in Hartshorne, namely that if $X = \operatorname{Spec}A$ then $Y$ is affine, and in fact is the closed subscheme determined by some ideal of $A$. Without this, I can't see how to reduce to the affine case since even if $X$ is affine, the restriction of $f$ to an arbitrary affine piece of $Y$ need not be a closed immersion. Although part $b)$ doesn't rely on part $a)$ and we therefore could use it to prove part $a)$, I can't help but think that if this is what Hartshorne had in mind then he would have switched the order around. This is the first time that I've had to use a later exercise to prove an earlier one and would like to avoid it if at all possible. Of course it's pretty much impossible to prove that such a proof doesn't exist. I would however accept an answer from someone who feels that they have enough experience to say that if such a proof exists they would most likely have seen it, or who can provide some reasonably convincing heuristic argument that it can't be done.","This question is based on question $3.11$ from chapter $2$ of Hartshorne, found on page $92$.

That $X=\cup_i X_{f_i}$ is easy, and I think the morphism $f$ comes from the invertibility of  $f_i$ in $\mathcal O_X(X_{f_i}),$ from the fact that morphisms into an affine scheme are in bijection with ring-homomorphisms of the rings of global sections, from the composition of the above deduced map with the inclusion $D_+(T_i)\rightarrow\mathbb P_A^n,$ and finally from the compatibility of these maps. But how could I show the compatibility of these maps? I am now confused by those entangling relations between morphisms and between schemes, and cannot see how to verify this compatibility. Also, to determine $f(x),$ first identiy $\mathbb P_k^n(k)$ with $\mathbb P(k^{n+1}).$ Then, for $x\in X(k)\cap X_{f_i},$ we find $f(x)=(\alpha_0,\cdots,\alpha_n),$ where $\alpha_j$ is the image of $f_i^{-1}f_j$ in $k=k(x).$ Any hint or answer is welcomed.
