0,Derivative of $f(z)=az$ at infinity is $\frac{1}{a}$?,Derivative of  at infinity is ?,f(z)=az \frac{1}{a},"I was going through a dynamical system lecture note and there it is said that the derivative of $f(z)=az$ at infinity is $\frac{1}{a}$, where $z\in \mathbb{C}_\infty$ i.e., Riemann sphere. Normally I would have thought it is $a$. Could someone please explain why it is $\frac{1}{a}$, and why is the answer $a$ wrong? Edit: The description in the lecture is: let $h(z)=\frac{1}{z}$, then $h^{-1}(z)=\frac{1}{z}$. Now let $f_1(z)=h^{-1}\circ f\circ h(z)=\frac{1}{a}z$. Then $f_1(z)^\prime\mid_0=f(z)^\prime\mid_\infty=\frac{1}{a}$. It is the last relation $f_1(z)^\prime\mid_0=f(z)^\prime\mid_\infty=\frac{1}{a}$ which I don't get. Can a function have more than one derivative at a point? Thanks a lot.","I was going through a dynamical system lecture note and there it is said that the derivative of $f(z)=az$ at infinity is $\frac{1}{a}$, where $z\in \mathbb{C}_\infty$ i.e., Riemann sphere.

1,Definition of a logarithm,Definition of a logarithm,,"My question is as follows: Is the below a useful elementary way of dealing with negative arguments? If not, what is a better (elementary or not) way of dealing with negative arguments of the logarithm? How could you extend those methods to complex arguments? Today I was in pre-calculus and was playing around with $\pi$ approximations (having finished my work), because I recently did a probabilistic Buffon's Needle $\pi$ approximation and accompanying proof for an AP stats project, and was interested in other $\pi$ approximations. While doing this I came upon this reasoning:  $$  e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0  \Rightarrow  \ln(-1)=i\pi . $$ Which I generalized to: $$ \log_{b}(x) = \log_{b}(x) + \frac{i\pi}{\ln(b)}; x < 0.$$ I then defined the logarithm function in a recursive way for all arguments $ x \in \mathbb{R}  \wedge x \not= 0$ as follows: $$ \log_b(x) = \begin{cases}        \log_b(x) & x > 0 \\       \log_b(x) + \frac{\pi i }{\ln(b)} & x < 0     \end{cases} $$ Because my pre-calculus teacher had said that the logarithmic function was not defined for negative arguments, and I knew complex analysis extends the logarithm (but I am not there yet, I just started real analysis) to complex arguments, I assumed there was not elementary way of dealing with negative arguments (although from the definition of the natural logarithm in calculus I ascertained, but never proved, that there was a way). There is two obvious problems I can see with my definition, namely it is recursive and in is not continuous at zero edit: I have tried to use the approach of using: $$-\int\limits_{-x}^1 \frac{dt}{t} = \ln(-x)$$ but it got nowhere, so I went back to Euler's identity approach, but more generalized. Here is the argument I came up with: let $x \in \mathbb{R}$. We now take the natural logarithm to be well defined for the positive reals, and so $\ln(|x|)$ is well defined. We also take $\log_b(x)$ to be defined as follows: $$ \log_b(x) := \frac{\ln(x)}{\ln(b)} $$ We will show that $$\forall x, \log_b(-|x|) = \frac{\pi i}{\ln(b)}+ \log_b(x)$$ lemma: First we show that  $$\ln(-|x|) = \pi i + \ln(|x|)$$ We consider $e^{zi} = \cos(z) + i \sin(z)$ where $z \in \mathbb{R}$ and $z$ is modulo $2 \pi$. we can see that $ln(\cos(z) + i \sin(z)) = zi$, if we let $\cos(z) + i \sin(z) = -1$ then $z \equiv \pi \bmod{2\pi}$. Now we look back and and expand our original equation: $$\ln(-|x|) = \ln(-1) + \ln(|x|)\ \ .$$ Now we can substitute $\ln(-1)$ with $\ln(\cos(z) + i \sin(z))$, where we have restricted $z$ to $-2\pi \leq z \leq 2\pi $ and we say it is equal to $\pi$. We get $$\ln(-|x|) = \ln(-1) + \ln(|x|) = \ln(\cos(z) + i \sin(z)) + \ln(|x|) \ \ .$$ Now we can see that because $ln(\cos(z) + i \sin(z)) = zi$ we can say: $$\ln(-|x|) = \pi i + \ln(|x|)\ \ \  \Box$$ Now we use this result to show our original conjuncture  $$\forall x, \log_b(-|x|) = \frac{\pi i}{\ln(b)}+ \log_b(x) \ \ .$$ Because we defined $\log_b(x)$ as $\frac{\ln(x)}{\ln(b)}$ we can see that  $$\log_b(-|x|) = \frac{\ln(-|x|)}{\ln(b)}$$ which, via our lemma, we see is $$\log_b(-|x|) = \frac{\pi i + \ln(|x|)}{\ln(b)}$$ which is simplified to $$\forall x, \log_b(-|x|) = \frac{\pi i}{\ln(b)}+ \log_b(x) \ \ \ \ \blacksquare$$ This argument, I think, is a bit stronger than starting at the special case $e^{\pi i} -1 = 0$. I have also considered the logarithm through the integral $$\int \frac{dx}{1+ax} = \frac{1}{a}\ln(1+ax) + C$$, but haven't seen if it would be fruitful to follow this path.","My question is as follows: Is the below a useful elementary way of dealing with negative arguments?

Here $[-1,1]$ denotes a closed interval in $\mathbb{R}$. The following solution mimics a derivation from Moore and Hadlock's text. Note that $z^2-1 = (z-1)(z+1)$. Consider the following four functions: \begin{align*}  w_1(z) &= \sqrt{|z-1|} e^{(i\operatorname{arg_1}(z-1))/2}  &\text{ where } \operatorname{arg_1}(z-1) \in [0,2\pi) \\ w_2(z) &= \sqrt{|z+1|} e^{(i\operatorname{arg_1}(z+1))/2}  &\text{ where } \operatorname{arg_1}(z+1) \in [0, 2\pi) \\ w_3(z) &= \sqrt{|z-1|} e^{(i\operatorname{arg_2}(z-1))/2}  &\text{ where } \operatorname{arg_2}(z-1) \in [-\pi,\pi) \\ w_4(z) &= \sqrt{|z+1|} e^{(i\operatorname{arg_2}(z+1))/2}  &\text{ where } \operatorname{arg_2}(z+1) \in [-\pi, \pi)  \end{align*}  Note that $w_1$ is analytic on the set $\{ z \in \mathbb{C}: \operatorname{arg}(z-1) \neq 0\} = \mathbb{C} \backslash [1, \infty)$; $w_2$ is analytic on the set $\{ z \in \mathbb{C}: \operatorname{arg}(z+1) \neq 0\} = \mathbb{C} \backslash [-1, \infty)$; $w_3$ is analytic on the set $\{ z \in \mathbb{C}: \operatorname{arg}(z-1) \neq \pi\} = \mathbb{C} \backslash (-\infty, 1]$; and $w_4$ is analytic on the set $\{ z \in \mathbb{C}: \operatorname{arg}(z+1) \neq \pi \} = \mathbb{C} \backslash (-\infty, -1]$. Therefore $w_1w_2$ is analytic on the set $\mathbb{C} \backslash [-1, \infty)$ and $w_3w_4$ is analytic on the set $\mathbb{C} \backslash (-\infty, 1]$. Furthermore, on the set $\mathbb{C} \backslash (-\infty, 1]$, we have $w_1w_2 = w_3w_4$, as we see below: If $x > 1$, then $\operatorname{arg_1}(x \pm 1) = \operatorname{arg_2}(x \pm 1) = 0$, and thus  $$w_1w_2(x)= w_3w_4(x) = \sqrt{x^2-1} \cdot e^{i \cdot 0} = \sqrt{x^2-1}.  $$ If $\operatorname{Im}(z) > 0$, then $w_1w_2(z) = w_3w_4(z)$ since $\operatorname{arg}(z-1), \operatorname{arg}(z+1) \in (0, \pi)$. If $\operatorname{Im}(z) < 0$, then $\operatorname{arg_1}(z\pm 1) = 2\pi + \operatorname{arg_2}(z\pm 1)$. Then  $$w_1w_2(z) = \sqrt{|z^2-1|} e^{i(\operatorname{arg_1}(z-1) +\operatorname{arg_1}(z-1))/2} = \sqrt{|z^2-1|} e^{i(\operatorname{arg_2}(z-1) +\operatorname{arg_2}(z-1))/2 + 2\pi i } $$ $$ = \sqrt{|z^2-1|} e^{i(\operatorname{arg_2}(z-1) +\operatorname{arg_2}(z-1))/2} = w_3w_4(z).$$ This implies that $w_1w_2$ is analytic not only on $\mathbb{C} \backslash [-1, \infty)$, but on the larger set $\mathbb{C} \backslash [-1, 1]$. This is a single-valued analytic branch of $\sqrt{z^2-1}$. However, for $x >1$, we have $w_1w_2(x) >0$. To address this, multiply $w_1w_2$ by $e^{i\pi}$. The resulting function is a single-valued analytic branch with the desired property.

Here $[-1,1]$ denotes a closed interval in $\mathbb{R}$. The following solution mimics a derivation from Moore and Hadlock's text. Note that $z^2-1 = (z-1)(z+1)$. Consider the following four functions: \begin{align*}  w_1(z) &= \sqrt{|z-1|} e^{(i\operatorname{arg_1}(z-1))/2}  &\text{ where } \operatorname{arg_1}(z-1) \in [0,2\pi) \\ w_2(z) &= \sqrt{|z+1|} e^{(i\operatorname{arg_1}(z+1))/2}  &\text{ where } \operatorname{arg_1}(z+1) \in [0, 2\pi) \\ w_3(z) &= \sqrt{|z-1|} e^{(i\operatorname{arg_2}(z-1))/2}  &\text{ where } \operatorname{arg_2}(z-1) \in [-\pi,\pi) \\ w_4(z) &= \sqrt{|z+1|} e^{(i\operatorname{arg_2}(z+1))/2}  &\text{ where } \operatorname{arg_2}(z+1) \in [-\pi, \pi)  \end{align*}  Note that $w_1$ is analytic on the set $\{ z \in \mathbb{C}: \operatorname{arg}(z-1) \neq 0\} = \mathbb{C} \backslash [1, \infty)$; $w_2$ is analytic on the set $\{ z \in \mathbb{C}: \operatorname{arg}(z+1) \neq 0\} = \mathbb{C} \backslash [-1, \infty)$; $w_3$ is analytic on the set $\{ z \in \mathbb{C}: \operatorname{arg}(z-1) \neq \pi\} = \mathbb{C} \backslash (-\infty, 1]$; and $w_4$ is analytic on the set $\{ z \in \mathbb{C}: \operatorname{arg}(z+1) \neq \pi \} = \mathbb{C} \backslash (-\infty, -1]$. Therefore $w_1w_2$ is analytic on the set $\mathbb{C} \backslash [-1, \infty)$ and $w_3w_4$ is analytic on the set $\mathbb{C} \backslash (-\infty, 1]$. Furthermore, on the set $\mathbb{C} \backslash (-\infty, 1]$, we have $w_1w_2 = w_3w_4$, as we see below: If $x > 1$, then $\operatorname{arg_1}(x \pm 1) = \operatorname{arg_2}(x \pm 1) = 0$, and thus  $$w_1w_2(x)= w_3w_4(x) = \sqrt{x^2-1} \cdot e^{i \cdot 0} = \sqrt{x^2-1}.  $$ If $\operatorname{Im}(z) > 0$, then $w_1w_2(z) = w_3w_4(z)$ since $\operatorname{arg}(z-1), \operatorname{arg}(z+1) \in (0, \pi)$. If $\operatorname{Im}(z) < 0$, then $\operatorname{arg_1}(z\pm 1) = 2\pi + \operatorname{arg_2}(z\pm 1)$. Then  $$w_1w_2(z) = \sqrt{|z^2-1|} e^{i(\operatorname{arg_1}(z-1) +\operatorname{arg_1}(z-1))/2} = \sqrt{|z^2-1|} e^{i(\operatorname{arg_2}(z-1) +\operatorname{arg_2}(z-1))/2 + 2\pi i } $$ $$ = \sqrt{|z^2-1|} e^{i(\operatorname{arg_2}(z-1) +\operatorname{arg_2}(z-1))/2} = w_3w_4(z).$$ This implies that $w_1w_2$ is analytic not only on $\mathbb{C} \backslash [-1, \infty)$, but on the larger set $\mathbb{C} \backslash [-1, 1]$. This is a single-valued analytic branch of $\sqrt{z^2-1}$. However, for $x >1$, we have $w_1w_2(x) >0$. To address this, multiply $w_1w_2$ by $e^{i\pi}$. The resulting function is a single-valued analytic branch with the desired property.

We try analytic continuation by $$\sum_{n>0} (n^s + n^{-s})^{-1} - n^{-s} =  - \sum_{n>0} (n^{3s} + n^{s})^{-1}$$ Then assuming $sum_{n>0} n^{-s}$ has interpretation as $\zeta(s)$ then : $T(s)=\sum_{n>0} (n^{3s} + n^s)^{-1} + \zeta(s)$ This now is suppose to be analytic for $Re(s) >1/3$ . We still assume $T(s) = T(-s)$ here. We can continue this proces by noticing $$g(x) = 1/(x + 1/x) = x/(1+x^2) = x - x^3 + x^5 - x^7 + ... = 1/x - 1/x^3 + 1/x^5 - 1/x^7 + ...$$ and $g(1/x) = g(x)$ . Also $$g(x) - 1/x = - 1/(x^3 + x)$$ $$g(x) - 1/x + 1/x^3 = 1/(x^5 + x^3)$$ ... $$g(x) - x = - 1/(x^{-3} + x)$$ $$g(x) - x + x^3 = 1/(x^{-5} + x^{-3})$$ ...

So we consider the infinite sum and use $T(s) = T(-s)$ : $$T(s) = \zeta(s) - \zeta(3s) + \zeta(5s) - \zeta(7s) + ... = \ T(-s) = \zeta(-s) - \zeta(-3s) + \zeta(-5s) - \zeta(-7s) + ...$$ by symmetry.

Changing the taylor expansion points slowly towards values s with small or negative real part might be more formal and better, but very complicated. I prefer $T(s) = \zeta(s) - \zeta(3s) + ...$ truncated at stopping at substraction. But maybe that zeta expansion is not valid or not so good. What is remarkable is that this $T(s)$ is close to the zeta function for $Re(s) >>1$ . Computing zero's, poles, branches, analytic continuation etc is the main goal.

26,What is the minimal order of a “sigmoid-like” entire function?,What is the minimal order of a “sigmoid-like” entire function?,,"The following question is motivated by Is there a complex analytic function that acts like sigmoid on the reals? : What is the minimal order of an entire function $f$ which is real-valued, increasing, and bounded on the real axis? In the above-referenced Q&A an additional condition is imposed on the second derivative, which I have omitted here for simplicity. The order of an entire function $f$ is defined as $$ \rho(f) = \limsup_{r \to \infty} \frac{\log \log M(r, f)}{\log r} $$ where $ M(r, f) = \max \{ |f(z)| : |z| = r \}$ is the maximum of $|f|$ on the circle with radius $r$ . The order of an entire function is equal to the order of its derivative (see, e.g., here ), therefore an equivalent question is What is the minimal order of an entire function $h$ which is real-valued, positive, and integrable on the real axis? The answer must be a value between $1$ and $2$ : The function $h(z) = \exp(-z^2)$ satisfies these conditions and has order $2$ , so that is an upper bound for the minimal order. The corresponding function $f(z) = \int_0^z f(t) \, dt$ is – apart from a constant factor – the Gauss error function . On the other hand, the Phragmén–Lindelöf principle shows that $\rho(f) \ge 1$ for any entire function which is bounded on the real axis. Some thoughts: The easiest way to construct admissible function $h$ of finite order would be to set $h(z) = \exp(p(z))$ with a polynomial $p$ with real coefficients. But in order to make $\int_{-\infty}^\infty h(x) \, dx$ finite, the degree of $p$ must be at least $2$ , so that does not lead to a better upper bound. $f(z) = \sin(z)$ has order one, is real-valued and bounded on the real axis, but is not increasing on the real axis.

Expanding the integrand, we've $$\lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0}\left(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{x \cos (x)}{x^2+\epsilon ^2}-\frac{\epsilon  \sin (x)}{x^2+\epsilon ^2}  \, dx + i \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{x \sin (x)}{x^2+\epsilon ^2}+\frac{\epsilon  \cos (x)}{x^2+\epsilon ^2} \, dx \right)= 2 \pi i$$ Using the linearity of the limit on the left hand side and equating real and imaginary parts, we have $$\lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0 } \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{x \sin (x)}{x^2+\epsilon ^2}+\frac{\epsilon  \cos (x)}{x^2+\epsilon ^2} \, dx = 2 \pi$$ and yet, at the same time, $$ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0 }\left(\frac{x \sin (x)}{x^2+\epsilon ^2}+\frac{\epsilon  \cos (x)}{x^2+\epsilon ^2}\right) \, dx = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\sin(x)}{x} \, dx =  \pi$$ I'd like to know why the exchange of limit and integral is making the difference here, is there something to do with the convergence of these integrals that is making this technique not work, or is there something I've plainly missed? One thing I can note is that I don't employ that idea I had originally, as the real and imaginary parts of the integrand above don't recover what I want to exploit.",,"['complex-analysis', 'convergence-divergence', 'improper-integrals', 'contour-integration']"

Show that $f$ extends to an isomorphism from $M\to N$. This is also Exercise 8.2 in Forster's text. I think we can prove this as follows (but I am not totally sure about this either). Let $a\in \mathcal{S}$ and pick a sequence $a_n \subset M \setminus > \mathcal{S}$ such that $a_n \to a$. Then, by compactness of $N$, there   is a subsequence $f(a_{n_k})$ converging to some $p \in N$. Suppose $p \in f(M \setminus \mathcal{S})$, and let $K:= \{f(a_{n_k}), > p\}$. Since $f$ is continuous, we have $f^{-1} (K)$ is closed, hence   $f^{-1} (K)$ is compact (by compactness of $M$). And, since $f$ is   injective, we have $f^{-1} (K) = \{a_{n_k}, f^{-1} (p)\}$. Let $U_k$ be a neighborhood of $a_{n_k}$ containing none of the other   elements of sequence $a_n$. Then for any neighborhood $U$ of $f^{-1}(p)$   , the cover $\{U_k, U\}$ has a finite subcover, so all but   finitely many elements of $a_{n_k}$ are in $U$.

If not, which ones do? In this answer (written by a student, so there may be mistakes), some claims are made which I'm trying to prove. First: Any map $\varphi$ which has such an extension $\tilde{\varphi}$ is such that $\tilde{\varphi}(\mathbb{R})=\mathbb{R}$ . Why? Certainly I see that $\tilde{\varphi}(\mathbb{R}) \supseteq \mathbb{R}$, but I don't see why they must be equal. Second: In this case $\tilde{\varphi}(\mathbb{R})=\mathbb{R} \Longrightarrow \tilde{\varphi}$ is an FLT .

Then $|f|$ attains a maximum at some point in boundary of $D$ (i guess topological boundary, and i guess equal to $\overline D \setminus D$ ). The comments Severin Schraven include: It makes quite a lot of sense to ask this question in my opinion. The point is that holomorphic functions have a lot of structure and force them to have certain features. (...) The maximum principle is a very strong property. General continuous functions can be extremely wild! A comment of Moishe Kohan: Strictly speaking, the question is meaningless unless the meaning of ""looks like"" is specified. For this reason, no self-respecting textbook will discuss this, nor an interviewer at a grad school interview. They may ask: ""What local properties of holomorphic functions do you know?""

Then attains a maximum at some point in boundary of (i guess topological boundary, and i guess equal to ). The comments Severin Schraven include: It makes quite a lot of sense to ask this question in my opinion. The point is that holomorphic functions have a lot of structure and force them to have certain features. (...) The maximum principle is a very strong property. General continuous functions can be extremely wild! A comment of Moishe Kohan: Strictly speaking, the question is meaningless unless the meaning of ""looks like"" is specified. For this reason, no self-respecting textbook will discuss this, nor an interviewer at a grad school interview. They may ask: ""What local properties of holomorphic functions do you know?"" This would be a reasonable ""long list"" question.

95,Boundary of the image of a continuous function contained in image of the boundary of the domain,Boundary of the image of a continuous function contained in image of the boundary of the domain,,"I am having trouble solving the following exercise: Let $U$ be a bounded domain, and let $f(z)$ be a continuous function on $U \cup \partial U$ that is holomorphic on $U$ . Show that $\partial\left( f(U)\right)\subseteq f(\partial U)$ , that is, the boundary of the open set $f(U)$ is contained in the image under $f(z)$ of the boundary of $U$ . One of the main issues I have with this exercise is that my teacher has defined the open mapping theorem as: Open mapping theorem: if $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{C}$ is a connected open set and $f$ is holomorphic and not constant on $\Omega$ , then $f(\Omega)$ is an open set in $\mathbb{C}$ . The additional hypothesis that the domain be connected means that we cannot apply the theorem directly. This is my approach: Suppose $f$ is not constant (if it is the result is clear). Since $\stackrel{\circ}{U}$ is open, for each $z\in\stackrel{\circ}{U}$ there exists $r_z>0$ such that the open disk of center $z$ and radius $r_z$ , $D(z, r_z)$ , is contained in $\stackrel{\circ}{U}$ . Then we can write $\stackrel{\circ}{U}$ as: $\stackrel{\circ}{U} = \bigcup_{z\in\stackrel{\circ}{U}} D(z, r_z)$ Hence: $f(\stackrel{\circ}{U}) = f\left(\bigcup_{z\in\stackrel{\circ}{U}} D(z, r_z)\right) = \bigcup_{z\in\stackrel{\circ}{U}} f\left(D(z, r_z)\right)$ Since $f$ is holomorphic in $\stackrel{\circ}{U}$ , disks are open connected sets and the arbitrary union of open sets is open, we can apply the Open mapping theorem to conclude that $f(\stackrel{\circ}{U})$ is an open set. This means that $f$ maps interior points of $U$ to interior points of $f(U)$ . Let $w$ be a point of $\partial f(U)$ , then there exists a sequence $w_n \subseteq f(U)$ that converges to $w$ , for $\partial f(U)$ is a compact set (1). By definition of $f(U)$ , for all $k\in\mathbb{N}$ there exists $z_k\in\stackrel{\circ}{U}$ such that $f(z_k) = w_k$ .
