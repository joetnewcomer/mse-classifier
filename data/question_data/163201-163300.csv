I have a hunch that what may have been used is the statement in the title. I've seen it used a couple of places already, but I cannot figure out why it is true. For example in this question Measurability of a stopped random variable. , both answers use the statement. As far as I'm aware, cadlag means that ALMOST every path is cadlag. I showed that if a process $X$ has each sample path cadlag and is adapted, then it is progressively measurable by using the the functions $X^n(s,\omega) = X(0,\omega)\mathbf{1}_{\{0\}}(s)+\sum\limits_{k = 1}^{2^n}X(tk/2^n,\omega)\mathbf{1}_{(t(k-1)/2^n, tk/2^n]}(s)$ on $[0,t]\times \Omega$. $X^n$ is $\mathcal{B}([0,t]) \bigotimes \mathcal{F}_t$ measurable and by right continuity, $X^n$ converges everywhere to $X$ on $[0,t]\times \Omega$, so X is progressively measurable. However, if we drop the assumption that $X$ has every path cadlag and instead just almost every path is cadlag (ie $X$ is a cadlag process) we can let $N = \{\omega \in \Omega: X(\cdot,\omega) \text{ is not cadlag}\}$. Then N is a null set. Even if $\mathcal{F}_t$ is complete, $N$ is a measurable null set in $\mathcal{F}_t$ and therefore $[0,t]\times N$ is null in $\mathcal{B}([0,t]) \bigotimes \mathcal{F}_t$. Since $X^n$ converges to $X$ pointwise on $([0,t]\times N)^c$ we have that $X^n$ converges to $X$ almost everywhere. Now, if we don't know that the product measure space ($[0,t] \times \Omega, \mathcal{B}([0,t]) \bigotimes \mathcal{F}_t) $ is complete, then we can't say that the limit $X$ is $\mathcal{B}([0,t]) \bigotimes \mathcal{F}_t$ measurable. So if anyone can clear up my confusion I would be very appreciative. I've been stumped for weeks now.

Let $\phi:X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a simple measurable function satisfying $0 \le \phi \le f$. Let $\alpha \in (0,1)$ and define   $$ A_n = \{x \in X: f_n(x) \ge \alpha \phi(x) \} .$$   Then $A_n$ is a measurable set for all $n$. My proof would go something like this: $$ A_n = \{ x \in X : f_n(x) - \alpha \phi(x) \ge 0 \} $$  $$ =  \bigcup _{q \in \mathbb{Q}} \{ x \in X : f_{n}(x) \ge q \} \cap \{  \phi (x) \ge q/\alpha \} $$ As both $f_n(x)$ and $\phi(x)$ are measurable functions,  $\{ x \in X : f_{n}(x) \ge q \} \cap \{ \phi (x) \ge q/\alpha \}  $ is the intersection of two measurable sets, so is also a measurable   set. Lastly, the countable union is also a measurable set. Is this proof correct? Thanks!",,"['measure-theory', 'proof-verification', 'lebesgue-measure', 'proof-explanation']"

In an attempt to use the Radon-Nykodym theorem to bulldoze through the admission of measures by bounded variation & monotonic functions (sidestepping all that Caratheodory machinery), I have stumbled upon the question in the title. It is clear that a strictly increasing left continuous function f may be decomposed into a continuous and a jump function, where the jump function is countably supported and hence $f=\lim_ig_c+g_{s,i}=\lim_ih_i$ where each jump function $g_{s,i}$ is finitely supported.  Furthermore, it is clear that each $h_i$ sends intervals to finite unions of intervals (some of which might perhaps be degenerate); that is, it sends Borel sets to Borel sets. I am struggling, though, to show that f sends Borel sets to Borel (or at least Lebesgue Mesurable) sets, since the support for $g_s$ might be dense (say, the rationals), and so I am not sure what control might be had over the image set f(I) in this case, where I is an interval. Note:  I had asked a much broader question about the application of the Radon-Nykodym theorem to this situation a few weeks ago; I have since made peace with my approach to the problem, and only this specific technicality remains. Also note:  Since the image $h_i(I) = J_i$ is a union of (perhaps degenerate) intervals, and the procession to $h_{i+1}(I)=J_{i+1}$ at most splits 1 interval and shifts finitely many others, it seems ""intuitive"" that such a process could not cause the ""limit"" of the $J_i$'s to leave the Borels (at least give or take a Lebesgue Measure zero set).  But in attempting to remove the quotations (and the doubt!) by, say, looking at the limit of the indicator functions of these sets after giving the points of jump the natural (ascending) ordering, I am still not confident in the passage from the finite to the countably infinite. Proposed solution:  perhaps I've just been approaching this all wrong!?  Such an f admits a (perhaps nonstrictly) increasing inverse; this $f^{-1}$ is Borel (or at least Lebesgue) measurable, is it not (since the pullback of a ray of reals is a ray of reals)?!

I don't understand how they are exactly applying the continuity theorem to the increasing sequence at hand to get $\mu(E^m\setminus E_{n_0(m)}^m) < \frac{\delta}{2^m}.$ I know it follows, by applying the theorem, that we may make, $$|\mu(E_n^m)-\mu(E^m)|<\epsilon$$ given any $\epsilon$, for sufficiently large $n$. Can one deduce the above bound by this one? I feel like it is a fairly small thing I am missing here. Thanks in advance.",,"['real-analysis', 'measure-theory']"

What I do know from Radon-Nikodym is that $ \nu_1 $ is mutually singular with $ \mu $ and also that $ \nu_2 << \mu $ I cannot move further. I think the hypotheses that we are dealing with $ \sigma-finite $ measure spaces is because Radon-Nikodym relies on this assumption but maybe it has a different meaning Progress: The M(X) is the space of all complex Radon measures. I can get by with showing that $ \nu_2 $ is Radon by the other exercise I told about now how do I show $ \nu_1 $ is Radon? Help please?",,"['real-analysis', 'general-topology', 'measure-theory']"
95,Extension of measure from $\sigma$-ring to $\sigma$-algebra,Extension of measure from -ring to -algebra,\sigma \sigma,"Halmos developed measure theory based on $\sigma$-rings. Nowadays measure theory is based on $\sigma$-algebras. I would like to know how to bridge the two theories if possible. Namely, let $(X, \mathcal R, \mu)$ be a measure space, where $\mathcal R$ is a $\sigma$-ring. Let $\mathcal A$ be the smallest $\sigma$-algebra containing $\mathcal R$. Can $\mu$ be extended to a measure on $\mathcal A$?. If yes, is the extension unique? My guess is that if $\mu$ is $\sigma$-finite, i.e. every member of $\mathcal R$ is covered by a countable union of members of finite measure, then the extension is unique.","Halmos developed measure theory based on $\sigma$-rings.
