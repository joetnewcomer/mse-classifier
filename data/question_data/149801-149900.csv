This can be proved using the absolute continuity of $\Gamma'$ (since $[a,b]$ is compact and $\Gamma'$ is assumed continuous, hence in $L^{1}([a,b])$) together with the fundamental theorem of calculus to obtain an $\epsilon$-small cover of $\Gamma$ by balls. But I am trying to prove this using more elementary means (i.e. without integration).  Intuitively, since $\Gamma$ is smooth, we ought to (for fine enough partitions) be able to cover $\Gamma$ by boxes which arise from its tangent line.  And by taking the partition of $[a,b]$ to be finer and finer, the ""tangent box"" cover ought to also get smaller and smaller. More rigorously, the vector-version of the mean value theorem can be applied: $$|\Gamma(t_{i-1})-\Gamma(t_{i})|\leq(t_{i}-t_{i-1})|\Gamma'(t_{i}^{\star})|\leq M_{i}\Delta t$$ where $t_{i}^{\star}\in(t_{i-1},t_{i})$ and $M_{i}=\sup_{t\in[t_{i-1},t_{i}]}|\Gamma'(t)|$ which exists and is finite since $\Gamma'$ is continuous.

Actually, to be more specific, for each $\epsilon>0$ there exists a $\delta>0$ such that $||P||<\delta$ implies $\int_{t_{i-1}}^{t_{i}}|\Gamma'(t)|dt<\epsilon$ (e.g. absolute continuity).

I should add, part (ii) of this problem asks us to show $\mu(K) = 1$, which is fairly easy from the part above, but it means for this part I cannot use it combined with monotonicity of the measure to show $\mu(J) = 1$, which is about the only idea I've come up with. Anyone have a hint at why $J$ must have measure 1, simply because it contains $K$, before knowing $K$ has measure 1? Thanks!",,"['real-analysis', 'analysis']"

19,Why is differentiability defined on open interval?,Why is differentiability defined on open interval?,,"If I have a subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ , a function $f: A \to \mathbb{R}$ , and a point $a \in A$ , then (according to the definitions I came across) for $f$ to be differentiable at $a$ , then there must exist some open interval $I$ so that $a \in I$ and $I \subseteq A$ . I tried understanding why this requirement exists, by first discarding it and seeing if it naturally arises from the other bits of the definition. NOTATION: For any $x \in X\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ , I define $D[x;X] \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ as: $$D[x;X] = \{ \ h \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \{ 0 \} \ | \ x + h \in X \ \}$$ and for any $\phi: X \to S$ such that $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ , I define $\mathrm{Q}^{\phi}_{x} : D[x;X] \to \mathbb{R}$ as: $$\mathrm{Q}^{\phi}_{x}(h) = \frac{\phi(x+h) - \phi(x)}{h}$$ DEFINITION: First I will fix the point $a \in A$ , and then define the derivative of $f$ at $a$ as: $$f'(a) = \lim_{ h \to 0 } \mathrm{Q}^{f}_{a}(h)$$ REFLECTION: If $f'(a)$ exists, then $\lim_{ h \to 0 } \mathrm{Q}^{f}_{a}(h)$ exists. For that to exist, $0\in\mathbb{R}$ has to be an accumulation point of $D[a;A]$ (every punctured neighbourhood of $0\in\mathbb{R}$ contains at least one point from $D[a;A]$ ). From that, it follows that $a\in A$ must be an accumulation point of $A$ . But now I am stuck, I am missing some sort of step or requirement or something, that would allow me to say: $$a_{0} \ \text{is an accumulation point of} \ A \ \ \wedge \ \ \text{something else} \implies \text{there must exist some open interval $I$ so that $a_{0} \in I$ and $I \subseteq A$.}$$ Now, I could always restrict the definition of limits to require that the domain of a function includes within it a punctured neighbourhood of the limit point. But that kind of feels like cheating? What is it that I am missing to make this step? EDIT: I thought maybe some common properties of derivatives cannot be proven with this definition. For example: $$f'(a) = \lim_{ h \to 0 } \mathrm{Q}^{f}_{a}(h) \implies \lim_{ x \to a } f(x) = f(a)$$ But sure enough, if I consider the function $I: D[a;A] \to \mathbb{R}; \ \  I(h) = h$ , I can deduce that $\lim_{ h \to 0 } I(h) = 0$ , so I can use the limit composition to say that: $$ \begin{align}  &\lim_{ h \to 0 } I(h) = 0 \ \ \text{and} \ \ \lim_{ h \to 0 } \mathrm{Q}^{f}_{a}(h) = f'(a) &\implies& \begin{aligned} \lim_{ h \to 0 } \left[ I(h) \cdot \mathrm{Q}^{f}_{a}(h) \right] &= \lim_{ h \to 0 } \left[ h \cdot \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} \right] \\ &= \lim_{ h \to 0 } \left[ f(a+h)-f(a) \right] \\ &= 0 \cdot f'(a) \\ &= 0 \\ \end{aligned} \\ &&\implies& \lim_{ x \to a } f(x) = a \\ \end{align} $$ In a similar vein, Hans Lundmark suggested that you need extra assumptions to prove the chain rule, but that doesn't seem to be true either (I might be wrong please check my proof🙏). For any subsets $A,B \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ , and for any functions $f: A \to \mathbb{R}$ and $g: B \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $f[A] \subseteq B$ , the composite function $g \circ f: A \to \mathbb{R}$ is well defined, which I will denote as $u$ . I will now: Fix the point $a \in A$ and assume that $f'(a) \in \mathbb{R}$ exists. Define $b \in B$ as $b = f(a)$ and assume that $g'(b) \in \mathbb{R}$ exists. Which means that: $$f'(a) = \lim_{ h \to 0 } \mathrm{Q}^{f}_{a}(h) \ \ \text{and} \ \  g'(b) = \lim_{ h \to 0 } \mathrm{Q}^{g}_{b}(h)$$ I define the function $k: D[a;A] \to \mathbb{R}; \ \ k(h) = f(a + h) - f(a)$ ; I know that $\lim_{ h \to 0 } k(h) = 0$ by the proof above. I then define the function $\mathrm{Q}^B: D[a;A] \to \mathbb{R}$ as: $$ \mathrm{Q}^B(h) = \begin{cases} \mathrm{Q}^{g}_{b}(k(h)) & k(h) \ne 0\\ g'(b) & k(h) = 0 \end{cases} $$ We can then deduce the following: $$ \begin{align} &\begin{aligned} \underline{\textbf{We know that:}} &&& \lim_{ h \to 0 } k(h) = 0 &&\iff \forall \varepsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0, \forall h \in D[a;A]: 0<|h|<\delta \implies |k(h)| < \varepsilon \\ &&& \lim_{ h \to 0 } \mathrm{Q}^{g}_{b}(h) = g'(b) &&\iff \forall \varepsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0, \forall h \in D[b;B]: 0<|h|<\delta \implies |\mathrm{Q}^{g}_{b}(h) - g'(b)| < \varepsilon \\ \end{aligned} \\ \\ &\begin{aligned} &\text{Take an arbitrary $\epsilon>0$, hence} && \text{$\exists \delta > 0, \forall h \in D[b;B]: 0<|h|<\delta \implies |\mathrm{Q}^{g}_{b}(h) - g'(b)| < \epsilon$} \\ &\text{Take the particular $d>0$ for which this is true, hence} && \text{$\forall h \in D[b;B]: 0<|h|<d \implies |\mathrm{Q}^{g}_{b}(h) - g'(b)| < \epsilon$} \\ &\text{Since $d>0$, we also have}&&\text{$\exists \delta > 0, \forall h \in D[a;A]: 0<|h|<\delta \implies |k(h)| < d$} \\ &\text{Take the particular $\varDelta>0$ for which this is true, hence}&&\text{$\forall h \in D[a;A]: 0<|h|<\varDelta \implies |k(h)| < d$} \\ &\text{Take an arbitrary $H \in D[a;A]$, hence}&&\text{$0<|H|<\varDelta \implies |k(H)| < d$} \end{aligned} \\ \\ &\begin{aligned} \underline{\text{Assume that $0<|H|<\varDelta$:}} &&&\text{Therefore we have $|k(H)|<d$} \\ &&&\text{By law of excluded middle, we have $k(H) = 0$ or $k(H) \ne 0$} \\ &&&\begin{aligned} \underline{\text{When $k(H) = 0$:}} &&&\text{$\mathrm{Q}^{B}(H) = g'(b)$, and therefore $0 = |\mathrm{Q}^{B}(H) - g'(b)| < \epsilon$} \end{aligned} \\ &&&\begin{aligned} \underline{\text{When $k(H) \ne 0$:}} &&&\text{$\mathrm{Q}^{B}(H) = \mathrm{Q}^{g}_{b}(k(H))$, and therefore $k(H) \in B[b;B]$} \\ &&&\text{Hence, we have $0<|k(H)|<d \implies |\mathrm{Q}^{g}_{b}(k(H)) - g'(b)| < \epsilon$} \\ &&&\text{Since $|k(H)| > 0$, we have $0<|k(H)|< d$} \\ &&&\text{By implication, we have $|\mathrm{Q}^{g}_{b}(k(H)) - g'(b)| = |\mathrm{Q}^{B}(H) - g'(b)| < \epsilon$} \end{aligned} \\  &&&\text{By cases, we conclude that $|\mathrm{Q}^{B}(H) - g'(b)| < \epsilon$} \end{aligned} \\ \\ &\begin{aligned} &\text{Therefore, we have} && 0<|H|<\varDelta \implies |\mathrm{Q}^{B}(H) - g'(b)| < \epsilon \\ &\text{$H$ is arbitrary, $\varDelta$ is particular, $\epsilon$ is arbitrary, so we have}&&\text{$\forall \varepsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0, \forall h \in D[a;A]: 0<|h|<\delta \implies |\mathrm{Q}^{B}(h) - g'(b)| < \varepsilon$} \\ &&& \iff \lim_{ h \to 0 } \mathrm{Q}^{B}(h) = g'(b) \end{aligned} \\ \\ &\begin{aligned} \underline{\textbf{We conclude that:}} &&& \lim_{ h \to 0 } \mathrm{Q}^{B}(h) = g'(b) \end{aligned} \end{align} $$ From here it is rather trivial to show that $\mathrm{Q}^{u}_{a}(h) = \mathrm{Q}^{B}(h) \cdot \mathrm{Q}^{f}_{a}(h)$ , just consider the cases $k(h) \not= 0, k(h) = 0$ in turn. Finally, by limit composition, we have $$ \begin{align}  &\lim_{ h \to 0 } \mathrm{Q}^{B}(h) = g'(b) \ \ \text{and} \ \ \lim_{ h \to 0 } \mathrm{Q}^{f}_{a}(h) = f'(a) &\implies& \begin{aligned} \lim_{ h \to 0 } \left[ \mathrm{Q}^{B}(h) \cdot \mathrm{Q}^{f}_{a}(h) \right] &= \lim_{ h \to 0 } \mathrm{Q}^{u}_{a}(h) \\ &= u'(a) = (g \circ f)'(a) \\ &= g'(b)f'(a) = g'(f(a))f'(a) \end{aligned} \\ &&\implies& u'(a) = g'(f(a))f'(a) \\ \end{align} $$ Hence, the chain rule holds. To the best of my knowledge, I don't think I made use of any additional assumptions to deduce this, beyond the definitions I provided. EDIT 2: As pointed out by Hans Lundmark (thankyou), my assumption that $f[A] \subseteq B$ is a little strong. The most general case in which composition still makes sense, is if we define the following: $A^* = \{ \ x \in A \ | \ f(x) \in B \ \}$ the restricted domain of $f$ for which composition can occur $f_{r} = \{ \ \langle x, y \rangle \in f \ | \ x \in A^* \ \}$ the corresponding restricted $f$ I can now define the composite function $g \circ f: A^* \to \mathbb{R}; \ \ x \mapsto g(f_{r}(x))$ , and as before: $u = g \circ f$ . Fix the point $a \in A^*$ and assume that $f'(a) \in \mathbb{R}$ exists. Define $b \in B^*$ as $b = f(a)$ and assume that $g'(b) \in \mathbb{R}$ exists. That seems to be the most general case for which the concept of function composition can make sense. And so, if I pick $A = \left\{ \ \frac{1}{2x} \ | \ x \in \mathbb{Z} \setminus \{ 0 \}, \frac{x}{3} \not\in \mathbb{Z} \  \right\} \cup \{ 0 \}$ and $B = \left\{ \ \frac{1}{3x} \ | \ x \in \mathbb{Z} \setminus \{ 0 \}, \frac{x}{2} \not\in \mathbb{Z} \  \right\} \cup \{ 0 \}$ and $f(x)=x$ and $g(x) = x$ and $a=0$ , then we see that $f'(0)=1$ and $g'(f(0))=1$ , but $u'(0)$ does not exist. Because $A^*= \{ 0 \}$ , so $0$ is not an accumulation point of $A^*$ . Here is a plot I drew up real quick: The extra assumption needed to make this work, is to require that $a$ is an accumulation point of $A^*$ . So then $f_{r}'(a) = f'(a)$ , and since $f_{r}[A^*] = B^* \subseteq B$ , we can just use the above proof and deduce that $u'(a)=g'(f(a))f'(a)$ . And none of these extra assumptions is needed when you assume the open interval.

And since $F$ is continuous, the function $x \mapsto \Delta_{h_{n}^{\delta}} F(x) = \frac{F(x + h_n^{\delta}) - F(x)}{h_n^{\delta}}$ is clearly continuous for all $h_n^{\delta}$ , and hence measurable. It follows that $G_{\delta}(x) := \sup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} {\Delta_{h_n^{\delta}}} F(x)$ is measurable because the supremum of a sequence of measurable functions is measurable . Now let $\{\delta_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be a sequence in $(0,\infty)$ such that $\delta_n \to 0$ .

In the case where $\sup_{h \in (0,\delta)} \Delta_h F(x)$ is assumed to be bounded on $(0,\delta)$ (for some $\delta > 0$ ), my argument for $(\star)$ is based on the following (more generalized) claim: Claim : Let $(S,d)$ be a metric space and let $E$ be a dense subset of $S$ . If $f: S \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is continuous, then $$ \sup_{x \in S} f(x) = \sup_{x \in E} f(x).$$ Proof : Let $\alpha := \sup_{x \in S} f(x)$ and $\alpha' := \sup_{x \in E} f(x)$ . Clearly, $\alpha' \leq \alpha$ , so we just need to show the reverse inequality. Fix $\epsilon > 0$ . Then there is some $x_0 \in S$ such that $f(x_0) > \alpha - \frac{\epsilon}{2}$ . Then since $f$ is continuous at $x_0$ , there exists some $\delta > 0$ such that \begin{align*}    x \in N_{\delta}(x_0) &\implies |f(x_0) - f(x)| < \frac{\epsilon}{2}  \\[3pt]                          &\implies -\frac{\epsilon}{2} < f(x_0) - f(x) <  \frac{\epsilon}{2} \\[3pt] &\implies f(x) > f(x_0) - \frac{\epsilon}{2} > \left(\alpha - \frac{\epsilon}{2}\right) - \frac{\epsilon}{2} = \alpha - \epsilon. \end{align*} Then since $E$ is a dense subset of $S$ , there exists some $x_1 \in E \cap N_{\delta}(x_0)$ . Hence, $\alpha' \geq f(x_1) > \alpha - \epsilon$ , i.e. $\alpha' > \alpha - \epsilon$ .  And since $\epsilon > 0$ was arbitrary, it follows that $\alpha' \geq \alpha. \quad \square$ Finally: Does this claim & proof look sound?","I am trying to write up a detailed proof for the following statement: Let be continuous.

31,Mistake in proof of Lemma 2.3 in Chapter 3 of Stein and Shakarchi's Fourier Analysis,Mistake in proof of Lemma 2.3 in Chapter 3 of Stein and Shakarchi's Fourier Analysis,,"I'm reading Fourier Analysis by Stein and Shakarchi and it seems to me that there's a mistake in the proof of Lemma 2.3 in Chapter 3. I wonder if there's something I'm missing or if someone could suggest an alternative proof. Any insight would be appreciated! Lemma 2.3 states: ""Suppose that the Abel means $A_r = \sum_{n = 1}^\infty r^n c_n$ of the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty c_n$ are bounded as $r$ tends to 1 (with $r < 1$ ). If $c_n = O (1/n)$ , then the partial sums $S_N = \sum_{n = 1}^N c_n$ are bounded."" The proof is as follows. Let $r = 1 - 1/N$ and choose $M$ so that $n|c_n| \leq M$ . We estimate the difference $S_N - A_r = \sum_{n = 1}^N (c_n - r^n c_n) - \sum_{n = N+1}^\infty r^n c_n$ as follows: $|S_N - A_r| \leq \sum_{n = 1}^N |c_n| (1-r^n) + \sum_{n= N+1}^\infty r^n |c_n| \leq M \sum_{n=1}^N (1-r) + \frac{M}{N} \sum_{n = N+1}^\infty r^n \leq MN(1-r) + \frac{M}{N} \frac{1}{1-r} = 2M$ , where we have used the simple observation that $1-r^n = (1-r)(1+r+\cdots + r^{n-1}) \leq n(1-r)$ . So we see that if $M$ satisfies both $|A_r| \leq M$ and $n|c_n| \leq M$ , then $|S_N| \leq 3M$ . The mistake I notice here is in the line where the authors claim that $MN(1-r) + \frac{M}{N} \frac{1}{1-r} = 2M$ . By my calculations, using their assumption that $r = 1 - 1/N$ , we instead have the following: $MN(1-r) + \frac{M}{N} \frac{1}{1-r} = M(N-1) + \frac{M}{N-1} = M(\frac{(N-1)^2 + 1}{N-1}) = M \frac{N^2 - 2N + 2}{N-1} = M \frac{(N-1)(N-2)}{N-1} = M(N-2)$ .

Prove that if $f = \mathcal{O}(x^{k})$, $f = \mathcal{o}(x^{k-1})$ Prove that if $g = \mathcal{o}(x)$, g is differentiable in 0. Next assume that for $m \in \mathbb{N}_{\leq 1}$, $g = \mathcal{o}(x^{m})$ and $g$ is $m$ times differentiable. Calculate $g^{(k)}(0)$ for $k \in \{0, 1, ..., m\}$ Assume $h$ is $n+1$ times differentiable with $h^{(n+1)}$ continuous and $h = \mathcal{o}(x^{n})$. Prove that $h = \mathcal{O}(x^{n+1})$. What I have tried is the following. As $f = \mathcal{O}(x^{k})$, there exists an open interval $I \subset Dom(f)$ with $0 \in I$ and $C>0$ so that if $x \in I$, $0 \leq |f(x)| \leq C |x|^{k}$. Using the squeeze theorem it follows that $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} f(x) = 0$, and because $0$ is an internal point of the domain of $f$, $f(0)=0$ so that the first condition for $f$ to be an element of $\mathcal{o}(x^{k-1})$ has been met. Next observe that $I = ]a,b[$ for some $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a < b$. Because $0 \in I$, $a < 0 < b$. Let $\delta < min\{|a|,|b|,1\}$ and name $D = ]-\delta,\delta[$. It follows that $0 \in D \subset I$. For $x \in D$, $|x| < 1$ and $|x|^{k} < |x|^{k-1}$, so $|h(x)| \leq C|x|^{k} \leq C|x|^{k-1}$. Is this the right direction to go in? Because I cant find the answer from here. Because $g = \mathcal{o}(x)$, g(0) = 0 and $lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{g(x)}{|x|} = 0$. Then $lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{g(x)}{|x|} = lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{g(x)-g(x)}{|x|-0} = lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{g(x)-g(x)}{x-0} = g'(0) = 0$. Doesnt it follow from this that every higher derivative of $g$ also equals 0? Nothing much, cause I have no idea how to start. Any help is greatly appreciated. edit : The definitions used are: $f = \mathcal{o}(x^{k}) \leftrightarrow f(0) = 0, \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x)}{|x|^{k}} = 0$ $f = \mathcal{O}(x^{k}) \leftrightarrow \forall x \in I, |f(x)| \leq C|x|^{k}$ For $I \subset Dom(f)$ open containing $0$, and $C > 0$.","The functions $f,g, h: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ have the origin 0 as an internal point of their domain.
