0,Changing signs of integration limits,Changing signs of integration limits,,"When we reverse the limits and then change the signs of the limits of the definite integral $$\int\limits_{-R}^{-\epsilon}\frac{e^{ix}}{x}dx $$ the integral becomes $$-\int\limits_{\epsilon}^{R}\frac{e^{-ix}}{x}dx $$ This is how the process appears to go: (1) Changing the order of the limits of integration adds the minus sign before the integral.

(2) Changing the signs of the limits changes the signs of the $x$'s, but also the sign of $dx$ appears to have changed as well, for otherwise there wouldn't be the minus sign before the integral.

4,Do full rank matrices in $\mathbb Z^{d\times d}$ preserve integrals of functions on the torus?,Do full rank matrices in  preserve integrals of functions on the torus?,\mathbb Z^{d\times d},"Let $\mathbb T:=[0,1]/(0\sim 1)$ .  Its easy to see that if $f:\mathbb T\to \mathbb R$ and $k\in\mathbb Z$ is not zero, then $f_k(x):=f(kx)$ (1) defines a map $ f_k:\mathbb T\to \mathbb R$ , and $$ \int_{\mathbb T} f_k(x) dx = \int_{\mathbb T} f(x)dx$$ Indeed: identifying with 1-periodic functions on $\mathbb R$ , one has $$ \int_{\mathbb T} f_k(x) dx = \int_0^1 f_k(x) dx = \frac1k\int_0^k f(y)dy \overset{\star}= \frac1k\sum_{j=0}^{k-1}\int_0^1f(y+j)dy = \int_0^1 f(y)dy. $$ Question Is the following $d$ dimensional analogue true? Let $f:\mathbb T^d\to \mathbb R$ and $K\in\mathbb Z^{d\times d}$ with $\det K\neq 0$ . We well-define a map $f_K:\mathbb T^d\to R$ by $f_K(x) := f(Kx)$ . Is it true that $$ \int_{\mathbb T^d} f_K(x) dx = \int_{\mathbb T^d} f(x)dx?$$ The above proof only extends to diagonal matrices $K$ . The issue for me is in getting a replacement for the identity marked $\star$ . For an example matrix where the above isn't enough, consider $M=\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ -1 & 2 \end{pmatrix}$ . $M$ sends $[0,1]^2$ (green) to $M[0,1]^2$ (red): and the associated change in coordinates (corresponding to the inverse map) looks like this: Note that $\det M=5$ and there are five small (rotated, translated) cubes in one big cube. So I suspect the calculation should go like this. Presumably, $$ \int_{\mathbb T^d} f(Kx)dx = |\ker K|\int_{\mathbb T^d/\ker K}f(Kx)dx\tag{A}$$ where we identify $K\in\mathbb Z^{d\times d}$ with the map $K:\mathbb T^d\to\mathbb T^d$ . Then, it seems that $$ |\ker K| = |\det K|\tag{B}$$ Since the First Isomorphism Theorem tells me that $K$ is an isomorphism from $\mathbb T^d/\ker K$ to $\mathbb T^d$ , change of variables $y=Kx$ (with Jacobian $1/|\det K|$ ) gives $$\int_{\mathbb T^d/\ker K}f(Kx)dx = \frac1{|\det K|}\int_{\mathbb T^d} f(y) dy,$$ which finishes the proof. So now the question is, how does one prove $(A),(B)$ ? The appearance of $\mathbb Z^{d\times d}$ reminds me (OK, it reminded a friend) of the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups, but I have forgotten this almost completely.

35,Is my derivation of the summation formula of the first squares correct?,Is my derivation of the summation formula of the first squares correct?,,"I have been thinking about the problem of finding the sum of the first squares for a long time and now I have an idea how to do it. However, the second step of this technique looks suspicious. $$\sum_{i=1}^n i = \frac{n^2+n}{2}$$ $$\int\sum_{i=1}^{n}idi=\int\frac{\left(n^{2}+n\right)}{2}dn$$ $$\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(\frac{i^{2}}{2}+C_{1}\right)=\left(\frac{n^{3}}{3}+\frac{n^{2}}{2}\right)\cdot\frac{1}{2}+C_{0}$$ $$\sum_{i=1}^{n}i^{2}=\frac{n^{3}}{3}+\frac{n^{2}}{2}-2nC_{1}+2C_{0} $$ Assuming $C_{0}=0$ . Next, we are going to find the constant $C_{1}$ From step 4, we can conclude that: $C_{1}=\frac{n^{2}}{6}+\frac{n}{4}-\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{i^{2}}{2n}$ . We can fix $n$ , at any value, it is more convenient to take one( $n=1$ ) then $C_{1}=-\frac{1}{12}$ $$\sum_{i=1}^{n}i^{2}=\frac{n^{3}}{3}+\frac{n^{2}}{2}+\frac{n}{6}$$ Using the induction method, we can prove the correctness of this formula and that the value of the constant $C_{0}$ is really zero. But I created this question because the second step looks very strange, since the left part was multiplied by differential $di$ , and the right by $dn$ . If we assume that the second step is wrong, then why did we get the correct formula of summation of first squares? Note: The technique shown based on the integrated one is really  interesting for me, using the same reasoning we can get the formula of the first cubes and so on EDIT1 According to @DatBoi's comment, we can calculate constants $C_{0}$ and $C_{1}$ by solving a system of linear equations. The desired system must contain two equations, since we have two unknown values( $C_{0}$ and $C_{1}$ ). To achieve this, we need to use the right part of the statement from step 4 twice, for two different n. For simplicity, let's take $n=1$ for first equation and $n=2$ for second equation, then the sum of the squares for these $n$ is 1 and 5, respectively. The main system $$ \left\{  \begin{array}{c} \frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{2}-2C_{1}+2C_{0}=1 \\  \frac{8}{3}+\frac{4}{2}-4C_{1}+2C_{0}=5 \\  \end{array} \right.  $$ After simplification $$ \left\{  \begin{array}{c} \ C_{0}-C_{1}=\frac{1}{12} \\  \ C_{0}-2C_{1}=\frac{1}{6} \\  \end{array} \right.  $$ Roots: $C_{0}=0$ and $C_{1}=-\frac{1}{12}$ EDIT2 Considering @epi163sqrt's answer, the second step should be changed and it will take this form: $$\sum_{i=1}^{n}\int_{ }^{ }idi=\int_{}^{}\frac{\left(n^{2}+n\right)}{2}dn$$ My hypothesis . If we have: $$\sum_{i=1}^{n}i^{p}=f\left(n,p\right)$$ Where $f$ is a closed form for summation, then this should be true for any natural degree $$\sum_{i=1}^{n}\int_{}^{}i^{p}di=\int_{}^{}f\left(n,p\right)dn\ \to\ \sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{i^{\left(p+1\right)}}{p+1}=\int_{}^{}f\left(n,p\right)dn-nC_{1}$$ Can you prove or disprove this hypothesis? My questions above are no longer relevant EDIT3. Time for fun. Let's try to get a formula for summing the first cubes $$\sum_{i=1}^{n}i^{2}=\frac{n^{3}}{3}+\frac{n^{2}}{2}+\frac{n}{6}$$ $$\sum_{i=1}^{n}\int_{ }^{ }i^{2}di=\int_{ }^{ }\frac{n^{3}}{3}+\frac{n^{2}}{2}+\frac{n}{6}dn$$ $$\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{i^{3}}{3}=\frac{n^{4}}{12}+\frac{n^{3}}{6}+\frac{n^{2}}{12}-nC_{1}+C_{0}$$ $$ \left\{  \begin{array}{c} \frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}-3C_{1}+3C_{0}=1 \\  \frac{16}{4}+\frac{8}{2}+\frac{4}{4}-6C_{1}+3C_{0}=9 \\  \end{array} \right.  $$ Roots: $C_{0}=0$ and $C_{1}=0$ $$\sum_{i=1}^{n}i^{3}=\frac{n^{4}}{4}+\frac{n^{3}}{2}+\frac{n^{2}}{4}$$ GREAT EDIT4 19.01.2022 So far I have no proof, however, the calculation of constants( $C_{0}$ and $C_{1}$ ) can be significantly simplified by changing the lower index of summation to 0. 1b. Let $M_{p}(n)$ be a closed form to obtain the summation, with degree of $p$ . I. e. $$\sum_{i=0}^{n}i^{p}=M_{p}\left(n\right)$$ 2b. Now let's assume that the statement written below is true $$\sum_{i=0}^{n}\int_{ }^{ }i^{p}di=\int_{ }^{ }M_{p}\left(n\right)dn$$ 3b. For now, we'll just take the integrals. $$\sum_{i=0}^{n}\left(\frac{i^{p+1}}{p+1}+C_{1}\right)=\int_{ }^{ }M_{p}\left(n\right)dn$$ 4b. Now let's express the sum explicitly. Also, we will move the $C_{1}$ without changing its sign, this is a valid action, since multiplying the constant by (-1) leads to another constant $$\sum_{i=0}^{n}i^{p+1}=\left(\int_{ }^{ }M_{p}\left(n\right)dn+nC_{1}\right)\left(p+1\right)$$ 5b. So we got the recurrent formula: $$M_{p}(n) = \left(\int_{ }^{ }M_{p-1}\left(n\right)dn+nC_{p}\right)p$$ $$M_{0}(n) = n+1$$ 6b. Now we have to build and resolve a system for two unknown constants. Therefore, the number of equations is two, we are also going to take n=0 and n=1: $$ \left\{  \begin{array}{c} M_{p}(0)=0 \\  M_{p}(1)=1 \end{array} \right.  $$ 7b. As I said, we have two constants. In order to see this, we will add a new definition for $W_{p-1}(n)$ that satisfies the following expression: $\int_{ }^{ }M_{p-1}\left(n\right)dn=W_{p-1}\left(n\right)+C_{-p}$ . $$ \left\{  \begin{array}{c} \left(W_{p-1}\left(0\right)+C_{-p}+0C_{p}\right)p=0 \\  \left(W_{p-1}\left(1\right)+C_{-p}+1C_{p}\right)p=1 \end{array} \right.  $$ 8b. I will skip the formal proof of the fact, but the intuition is that $W_{p}(n)$ is a polynomial that does not have a constant term. Therefore, we can safely know that $W_{p}(0)=0$ . let's rewrite and simplify the system: 8b.1. $$ \left\{  \begin{array}{c} \left(C_{-p}\right)p=0 \\  \left(W_{p-1}\left(1\right)+C_{-p}+C_{p}\right)p=1 \end{array} \right.  $$ 8b.2. $$ \left\{  \begin{array}{c} C_{-p}=0 \\  \left(W_{p-1}\left(1\right)+C_{p}\right)p=1 \end{array} \right.  $$ 8b.3 $$ C_{p}=\frac{1}{p}-W_{p-1}\left(1\right) $$ 9b. We have completed the study of the constant. The last action is to match everything together. $$ M_{p}\left(n\right)=p\left(\left(\int_{ }^{ }M_{p-1}\left(n\right)dn\right)_{n}-n\left(\int_{ }^{ }M_{p-1}\left(n\right)dn\right)_{1}\right)+n $$ $$M_{0}(n) = n+1$$ 10b.

However, the second step of this technique looks suspicious. Assuming . Next, we are going to find the constant From step 4, we can conclude that: . We can fix , at any value, it is more convenient to take one( ) then Using the induction method, we can prove the correctness of this formula and that the value of the constant is really zero. But I created this question because the second step looks very strange, since the left part was multiplied by differential , and the right by . If we assume that the second step is wrong, then why did we get the correct formula of summation of first squares? Note: The technique shown based on the integrated one is really  interesting for me, using the same reasoning we can get the formula of the first cubes and so on EDIT1 According to @DatBoi's comment, we can calculate constants and by solving a system of linear equations. The desired system must contain two equations, since we have two unknown values( and ). To achieve this, we need to use the right part of the statement from step 4 twice, for two different n. For simplicity, let's take for first equation and for second equation, then the sum of the squares for these is 1 and 5, respectively. The main system After simplification Roots: and EDIT2 Considering @epi163sqrt's answer, the second step should be changed and it will take this form: My hypothesis . If we have: Where is a closed form for summation, then this should be true for any natural degree Can you prove or disprove this hypothesis? My questions above are no longer relevant EDIT3. Time for fun. Let's try to get a formula for summing the first cubes Roots: and GREAT EDIT4 19.01.2022 So far I have no proof, however, the calculation of constants( and ) can be significantly simplified by changing the lower index of summation to 0. 1b. Let be a closed form to obtain the summation, with degree of . I. e. 2b. Now let's assume that the statement written below is true 3b. For now, we'll just take the integrals. 4b. Now let's express the sum explicitly. Also, we will move the without changing its sign, this is a valid action, since multiplying the constant by (-1) leads to another constant 5b. So we got the recurrent formula: 6b. Now we have to build and resolve a system for two unknown constants. Therefore, the number of equations is two, we are also going to take n=0 and n=1: 7b. As I said, we have two constants. In order to see this, we will add a new definition for that satisfies the following expression: . 8b. I will skip the formal proof of the fact, but the intuition is that is a polynomial that does not have a constant term. Therefore, we can safely know that . let's rewrite and simplify the system: 8b.1. 8b.2. 8b.3 9b. We have completed the study of the constant. The last action is to match everything together. 10b.

36,Solving $\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\frac{1}{\sin^{2n}(x) + \cos^{2n}(x)}\:dx$,Solving,\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\frac{1}{\sin^{2n}(x) + \cos^{2n}(x)}\:dx,"Spurred on this question I decided to investigate the following integral: \begin{equation}  I_n = \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\frac{1}{\sin^{2n}(x) + \cos^{2n}(x)}\:dx \end{equation} Where $n \in \mathbb{N}$ . The approach I've taken is rather simple and whilst I've arrived at a closed form solution, I'm wondering whether the resultant sum can be expressed in terms of (non)-elementary functions. Would love to see other methods that can be used to solve this! (Using any methods). First: \begin{equation}  I_n = \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\frac{1}{\sin^{2n}(x) + \cos^{2n}(x)}\:dx = \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\frac{1}{\left[\sin^{2}(x)\right]^n + \left[\cos^{2}(x)\right]^n}\:dx \end{equation} Using the Double-Angle Formulas : \begin{equation}   \sin^2(x) = \frac{1 - \cos\left(2x\right)}{2} \qquad \cos^2(x) = \frac{1 + \cos\left(2x\right)}{2} \end{equation} Thus: \begin{align}  I_n &= \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\frac{1}{\left[\sin^{2}(x)\right]^n + \left[\cos^{2}(x)\right]^n}\:dx = \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\frac{1}{\left[\frac{1 - \cos\left(2x\right)}{2}\right]^n + \left[\frac{1 + \cos\left(2x\right)}{2}\right]^n}\:dx \\ &= 2^n \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{1}{\left[1 - \cos\left(2x\right)\right]^n + \left[1 + \cos\left(2x\right)\right]^n}\:dx \end{align} Making the substitution $u = 2x$ \begin{equation} I_n = 2^n \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{1}{\left[1 - \cos\left(2x\right)\right]^n + \left[1 + \cos\left(2x\right)\right]^n}\:dx =  2^{n - 1} \int_0^{\pi} \frac{1}{\left[1 - \cos\left(u\right)\right]^n + \left[1 + \cos\left(u\right)\right]^n}\:du \end{equation} Now apply the Weierstrass (/Tangent half angle) substitution $t = \tan\left(\frac{u}{2}\right)$ : \begin{align} I_n &=  2^{n - 1} \int_0^{\pi} \frac{1}{\left[1 - \cos\left(u\right)\right]^n + \left[1 + \cos\left(u\right)\right]^n}\:du =  2^{n - 1} \int_0^{\infty} \frac{1}{\left[1 - \frac{1 - t^2}{1 + t^2}\right]^n + \left[1 + \frac{1 - t^2}{1 + t^2}\right]^n} \frac{2\:dt}{t^2 + 1} \\ &=   \int_0^{\infty} \frac{\left[1 + t^2 \right]^{n - 1}}{t^{2n} + 1}\:dt  \end{align} By the Binomial Theorem : \begin{equation}  \left[1 + t^2 \right]^{2n - 1} = \sum_{j = 0}^{n - 1} {n - 1 \choose j}t^{2j} \end{equation} Thus: \begin{align} I_n &=  \int_0^{\infty} \frac{\left[1 + t^2 \right]^{2n - 1}}{t^{2n} + 1}\:dt = \sum_{j = 0}^{n - 1} {n - 1 \choose j} \int_0^{\infty} \frac{t^{2j}}{t^{2n} + 1} \end{align} Using the solution I found here we find: \begin{align} I_n &=   \sum_{j = 0}^{n - 1} {n - 1 \choose j} \int_0^{\infty} \frac{t^{2j}}{t^{2n} + 1} = \sum_{j = 0}^{n - 1} {n - 1 \choose j} \cdot \frac{1}{2n} \cdot 1^{\frac{2j + 1}{2n} - 1}B\left(1 - \frac{2j + 1}{2n} , \frac{2j + 1}{2n}\right) \\ &= \frac{1}{2n}\sum_{j = 0}^{n - 1} {n - 1 \choose j} B\left(1 - \frac{2j + 1}{2n} , \frac{2j + 1}{2n}\right) \end{align} Using the relationship between the Beta and Gamma function : \begin{align} I_n &= \frac{1}{2n}\sum_{j = 0}^{n - 1} {n - 1 \choose j} B\left(1 - \frac{2j + 1}{2n} , \frac{2j + 1}{2n}\right) = \frac{1}{2n}\sum_{j = 0}^{n - 1} {n - 1 \choose j} \frac{\Gamma\left(1 - \frac{2j + 1}{2n}\right)\Gamma\left(\frac{2j + 1}{2n}\right)}{\Gamma\left(1 - \frac{2j + 1}{2n} + \frac{2j + 1}{2n}\right)} \\ &= \frac{1}{2n}\sum_{j = 0}^{n - 1} {n - 1 \choose j}\Gamma\left(1 - \frac{2j + 1}{2n}\right)\Gamma\left(\frac{2j + 1}{2n}\right) \end{align} As $\frac{2j + 1}{2n} \not \in \mathbb{Z}$ we can employ Euler's Reflection Formula to yield: \begin{align} I_n &= \frac{1}{2n}\sum_{j = 0}^{n - 1} {n - 1 \choose j}\Gamma\left(1 - \frac{2j + 1}{2n}\right)\Gamma\left(\frac{2j + 1}{2n}\right) = \frac{1}{2n}\sum_{j = 0}^{n - 1} {n - 1 \choose j} \frac{\pi}{\sin\left(\pi \cdot \frac{2j + 1}{2n}\right)} \\&= \frac{\pi}{2n}\sum_{j = 0}^{n - 1} {n - 1 \choose j} \operatorname{cosec}\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\left(2j + 1\right) \right) \end{align} Thus, \begin{equation} \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\frac{1}{\sin^{2n}(x) + \cos^{2n}(x)}\:dx = \frac{\pi}{2n}\sum_{j = 0}^{n - 1} {n - 1 \choose j} \operatorname{cosec}\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\left(2j + 1\right) \right) \end{equation} Edit - Realised that $2n - 1$ should be $n - 1$ Extra Addition: Using the same method as above an by letting \begin{equation}  S_n(x) = \sin^{2n}(x) + \cos^{2n}(x) \end{equation} It becomes rather easy to solve: \begin{equation}  I_{n,m} = \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{S_n(x)}{S_m(x)}\:dx \end{equation} Where $n \lt m$ .

58,Complex integration tricks for evaluating real integrals,Complex integration tricks for evaluating real integrals,,"I was doing some homework and I stumbled upon this integral: $$ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}dx \, \frac{\cos(x)-1+\frac{x^2}{2}}{x^4} $$ My first thoughts were: at $\pm\infty$ it should converge, since the order of the denominator is bigger. expanding in Taylor's series of the argument at $0$ should be: $\frac{1}{4!}+O(x^6)$ . This means that the integral also converges near $0$ , and the function is continuous (so there is an analytic continuation in $0$ ). Im a little bit stuck because if the function is analytical its integral should be $0$ ? But this is not the case in the solution. Also, when adding two arcs (one at infinity and one around $0$ ) to close the loop, no other non-analytic points exists, so the residue theorem also says that the integral is $0$ .

I then differentiate to get Evaluating this integral by integration by parts and geometric series I get So I arrive at Re-indexing I get Integrating both sides from to I recover Then using the integral equation for the Dilogarithm I arrive at At this point I could not continue further as I did not know how to simplify the Digamma terms in the sums. I think that by using the Digamma function's relation to the Harmonic Numbers it could be possible to exploit known values of Harmonic sums to arrive at the answer but I could not get the sums in a form where this would work.

I'm interested in understanding what the reasons are for this position, primarily because I'm curious about why something I've been taught since childhood might be wrong. Also, as I'm starting to study mathematics at postgraduate level I'm seeing definite integration used more often. For example initial conditions are often applied directly as in $y(0)=0, f(y)\,dy/dx = g(x) \implies \int_0^yf(u)\,du = \int_0^x g(v)dv$, and I'm having to get used to seeing solutions written out with embedded definite integrals where analytic results can't be found.
