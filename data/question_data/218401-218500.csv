1,Hyperbolic trigonometry NOT in Poincare disk,Hyperbolic trigonometry NOT in Poincare disk,,"There are a lot of hyperbolic trigonometric identities derived in Poincare disk model that resemble similar identities from the Euclidean geometry. For example, the analogue of the Pythagoras theorem is $\cosh(c) = \cosh(a)\cosh(b)$ , the analogue of the sine law is $\frac{\sin(A)}{\sinh(a)}$ = $\frac{\sin(B)}{\sinh(b)}=\frac{\sin(C)}{\sinh(c)}$ and so on.

Hopefully you big brained folks can explain down to me. :) I'm good at visualizing math concepts, but I lack any substantial experience, save perhaps g/FooBar. So, sans elegance: Edit: Using the below descriptions, I'm attempting to model a room with people talking into mics while facing the center of the room. The segment variability models the potential distance to a mic that the respective person might be, as people in this environment will often change their position from leaning into a mic to leaning back in their chair. I realize these constraints limit beyond actual potential for where a person might be physically located relative to their mic. However, I picked the constraints because 1. they cover the vast majority of cases 2. I am actually interested in learning how to solve the problem as described 3. the output I am trying to achieve is for estimating time delays to compare to cross-correlegrams, so imperfection is quite alright. Let's start with a basic open acoustic space, and represent its length and width using a 2d grid. For simplicity, let's assume our origin (0, 0) marks the center of the room. Place 3 microphones (a,b,c) at random in the room. Imagine onto our 2d space 3 rays (a1,b1,c1) that start at the origin, and cross each of the microphone coordinates. Now let's add 3 sound sources (A,B,C) to the space with the following constraints: A,B,C respectively fall on rays a1, b1, and c1 the distance to each sound source A,B,C from 0,0 is > the distance to the respective mics apply some arbitrary limit (L) to the distance between respective sources and mics So, based on the title of this question, the 3 segments start at the mic coords a,b,c, and overlap rays a1,b1,c1 each for a length of L. The sound sources A,B,C could fall anywhere on their respective segments. How do I use the (precise) varying sound arrival times at the mics a,b,c to determine the relative coordinates of the mics when I don't know exactly where the sound sources A,B,C are located, only that the sources A,B,C are constrained to fall on the segments a1,b1,c1? To be overtly concise, we do not start with exact knowledge of the distances A-a, B-b, C-c, rather the data we have is (A:a-b,a-c)(B:b-a,b-c)(C:c-a,c-b).

26,Finding the distance from a point a distance $z$ above the center of a square to any point on the edge,Finding the distance from a point a distance  above the center of a square to any point on the edge,z,"I was working on an electrostatics problem that I thought I was doing correctly. However, upon reading the solution I see I was not. I will post my attempt and the solution below and then ask a few (math pertinent) questions about both my attempt and the solution provided. I would greatly appreciate any help in understanding this problem. Thanks! Problem Statement Find the electric field a distance $z$ above the center of a square loop (side length $a$ ) carrying uniform line charge $\lambda$ . My attempt Well, first I knew that the $x$ and $y$ components would cancel due to symmetry so that only leaves the $z$ component. For the $z$ component itself I noted that there are $4$ line segments of equal length (hence equal charge) and so we could calculate the electric field due to one segment then just multiply it by $4$ (since each contribution would be pointing in the positive $z$ direction). Doing so yielded $$E_z = \frac{1}{\pi\epsilon_0}\int_{-\frac{a}{2}}^{\frac{a}{2}} \frac{\lambda dx}{R^2}\sin\theta \hat{z} = \frac{1}{\pi\epsilon_0}\int_{-\frac{a}{2}}^{\frac{a}{2}} \frac{\lambda dx}{(z^2 + (\frac{a}{2}^2)}\frac{z}{\sqrt{(z^2 + (\frac{a}{2})^2}} \hat{z} = \frac{1}{\pi\epsilon_0}\int_{-\frac{a}{2}}^{\frac{a}{2}} \frac{\lambda z dx}{(z^2 + (\frac{a}{2})^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}} \hat{z} = \frac{\lambda z}{\pi\epsilon_0(z^2 + (\frac{a}{2})^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}}[x]\vert^{\frac{a}{2}}_{-\frac{a}{2}} = \frac{\lambda z a}{\pi\epsilon_0(z^2 + (\frac{a}{2})^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}}$$ Where the distance from the center of an edge to the point $P$ is given by $R = \sqrt{z^2+ (\frac{a}{2})^2}$ and I implicitly multiplied by $4$ from the start by writing $\frac{1}{\pi\epsilon_0}$ Provided Solution They note the distance from $P$ to the center of the edge is also $R = \sqrt{z^2+ (\frac{a}{2})^2}$ and that the electric field due to one edge is then $$E_1 = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{\lambda a}{\sqrt{z^2 + \frac{a^2}{4}}\sqrt{z^2 + \frac{a^2}{4} + \frac{a^2}{4}}}$$ Hence the total vertical contribution to the electric field is found by multiplying by $4\sin\theta = 4\frac{z}{\sqrt{z^2 \frac{a^2}{4}}}$ which yields $$E = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{4\lambda az}{(z^2 + \frac{a^2}{4})\sqrt{z^2 + \frac{a^2}{2}}}$$ My questions I would just like help seeing where they found the expression for the field contribution for one segment. In particular the expression for the distance between the point $P$ and the source charge. I feel like maybe it comes about from integrating with $x$ -dependence in the denominator. It feels a bit ""wrong"" to not have any $x$ -dependence in my expression for the distance since the distance will change as we integrate along the line charge. The only way I can think about incorporating this is: for every small increment moved on the $x$ axis, we would create a right triangle (in the xy plane) with opposite and adjacent sides defined by the distance from the center of the square in the plane (static), $\frac{a}{2}$ , and the distance we've moved along the $x$ -axis from $0$ (varying) such that the hypotenuse of that triangle in the xy-plane would then become the xy-component of the $3D$ triangle used to calculate the distance from the point $P$ to a point on the edge. But that seems quite cumbersome. Any help in understanding where their expression for the distance came from and/or how to account for varying distance as we move along the line charge will be greatly appreciated.","I was working on an electrostatics problem that I thought I was doing correctly.

For starters, I set up a triangle like this: https://i.sstatic.net/sODTm.png since $\cos(x) = \frac{adjacent}{hypotenuse}$ .

Thank you. $$ \arccos\left(\frac{1-x^2}{1+x^2}\right) = -2\arctan(x) $$ So, I start off with analysing the domain. It's clear that arctan is defined for all values of x that are a member of the real numbers. We can also see that the argument of arccos is less than 1 and greater than -1 for all x's. So that means, our equation is defined for all x's that belongs to the real numbers. $$\Rightarrow \tan(\arccos(\frac{1-x^2}{1+x^2}) = \tan(-2\arctan(x))$$ Using the fact that $\tan(x) = \sqrt{1-\cos^2(x)}/\cos(x)$ as well as $\tan(2x) = \frac{2\tan(x)}{1-\tan^2(x)}$ .

Also, the product of the two complex numbers $z_{1}z_{2}$ is equal to $(ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i$ . Writing this in polar form, we have $z_{1}z_{2} = \sqrt{(ac - bd)^{2} + (ad + bc)^{2}}\,\angle\,\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{ad + bc}{ac - bd}\right)$ . Let this product be $z_{3}$ .

If, for instance, $\mathrm{Re}(z_{i}) = 0$ , then the sign of $\mathrm{Im}(z_{i})$ will determine the sign of $\frac{\pi}{2}$ . Also, if $\mathrm{Re}(z_{i}) < 0$ and $\mathrm{Im}(z_{i}) > 0$ , we can just take the angle of a complex number $z$ where $\mathrm{Re}(z) = \mathrm{Im}(z_{i})$ and $\mathrm{Im}(z) = \mathrm{Re}(z_{i})$ .

By substitution, \begin{align*}\tan^{-1}\left(\tan u\right) + \tan^{-1}\left(\tan v\right) &\overset{?}{=} \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\tan u + \tan v}{1 - (\tan u)(\tan v)}\right) \\ u + v &\overset{?}{=} \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\tan u + \tan v}{1 - (\tan u)(\tan v)}\right) \\ \tan(u + v) &\overset{?}{=} \frac{\tan u + \tan v}{1 - (\tan u)(\tan v)}\end{align*} The last relation is known to be true.

95,Deriving the centripetal acceleration in circular motion,Deriving the centripetal acceleration in circular motion,,"I tried to make sure I understand uniform circular motion by deriving the formula for centripetal acceleration, $a_c = v^2/r$ , rigorously from first principles. I think I did it correctly, but it seems quite complicated - can you show me better ways? Given a particle moving uniformly in a circule of radius $r$ around $O$ with period $T$ , I take it as given that it has tangential velocity at each point with the same constant magnitude. So let's say its velocity at the topmost point, broken down into Cartesian components, is $v_0=(v,0)$ . Now some small amount of time $\Delta t$ passes, and the particle rotates by the angle $\alpha = \frac{2\pi}{T} \Delta t$ . The magnitude of velocity remains $v$ , and it's now pointed in the new tangential direction, so it's easy to see its components as $v_1=(v\cos\alpha, v\sin\alpha)$ . Now acceleration is the limit of $\frac{v_1-v_0}{\Delta t}$ when $\Delta t \to 0$ . I just want the magnitude of acceleration which will be $$\lim_{\Delta t \to 0}\frac{\sqrt{(v\cos\alpha - v)^2 + (v\sin\alpha)^2}}{\Delta t}$$ I can simplify this, by passing to $\alpha$ as the dependent variable ( $\Delta t=\frac{T}{2\pi}\alpha$ ), to $$v \frac{2\pi}{T} \lim_{\alpha \to 0}\frac{\sqrt{2-2\cos\alpha}}{\alpha}        $$ To evaluate the limit, I bring the denominator under the square sign and break down $\cos\alpha$ by its Taylor series: $$\lim_{\alpha \to 0}\sqrt{\frac{2-2\cos\alpha}{\alpha^2}} = \lim_{\alpha \to 0}\sqrt{\frac{2-2(1-\frac{\alpha^2}{2} + \frac{\alpha^4}{24} - \cdots}{\alpha^2}} =  \lim_{\alpha \to 0}\sqrt{1 - \frac{\alpha^2}{12} + \cdots} = 1$$ So in the end the magnitude of acceleration is $v\frac{2\pi}{T}$ . But since the particle traces the circumference of the circle, of length $2\pi r$ , under constant speed $v$ in time $T$ , we have $vT = 2\pi r$ , so $\frac{2\pi}{T} = \frac{v}{r}$ , and finally the acceleration is the familiar formula $$a_c=\frac{v^2}{r}$$ Did I do this right? And even if I did, was it necessary to do the Taylor series stuff to obtain the trigonometric limit? What are some ways to make this derivation easier, but still rigorous under the formal definition of acceleration in Cartesian coordinates?","I tried to make sure I understand uniform circular motion by deriving the formula for centripetal acceleration, , rigorously from first principles.
