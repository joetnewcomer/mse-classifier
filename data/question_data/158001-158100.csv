I was able to prove everything up to the last two points: Let $\zeta=e^{(\frac{2\pi i}{3})}$. Consider $A:=\mathbb{Z}[\zeta]=\{a+\zeta b \quad|\quad a,b\in \mathbb{Z}\}$. Then $\zeta$ is a root of the irreducible poly. $X^2+X+1$. The field of fractions of $A$ is $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ The norm map $N:\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})\rightarrow \mathbb{Q},$ given by $a+\sqrt{-3}b \mapsto a^2+3b^2$ is multiplicative and sends every element in $A$ to an element in $\mathbb{Z}$. In particular, $u\in A$ is a unit iff $N(u)\in\{-1,1\}$. Moreover, if $N(a)=\pm$ prime number, then $a$ is irreducible. The unit group $A^x$ is cyclic of order $6$. ($A^x=\{\pm 1, \pm\zeta, \pm\zeta^2\}$) The ring $A$ is Euclidean with respect to the norm $N$ and hence a unique factorisation domain. The element $\lambda=1-\zeta$ is a prime element in $A$ and $3=-\zeta^2\lambda^2$. The quotient $A$ / $(\lambda)$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{F}_3$. The image of the set $A^3=\{a^3|a\in A\}$ under $\pi: A \rightarrow A / (\lambda^4)=A / (9)$ is equal to $\{0+(\lambda^4),\pm 1+(\lambda^4),\pm \lambda^3+(\lambda^4)\}$ I was not able to prove 7 and 8. For 7 I do not even know which isomorphism, I guess it should be an isomorphism of rings? I hope anybody knows what to do or has at least some hints, Thanks in advance for your help!",,"['number-theory', 'algebraic-number-theory']"

Prove that the congruence $ax \equiv 1 \mod p$ has a solution (Without using Fermat's Theorem), I can intuitively tell this is true because since $p$ is prime, every $x < p$ is co-prime to it, thus $$x \mod p$$  Will produce a unique integer for each $x \in \{0, 1, 2, .... p-1\}$, before it cycles over again at $p$. Clearly, some $x$ must have that $x \mod p = 1$. However, I don't know how to prove this for $ax$, mainly because I can't prove the ramifications it can have on the mod cycle. What I do know is that if for some $x$, we have: $$ax \equiv ay \mod p$$ Then since $p$ doesn't divide $a$ (by question assumption), it must divides $x - y$, implying that the solution for $ax \equiv 1 \mod p$ only depends on $x$, however, I don't know how to show this rigorously. Could anyone enlighten me?",,"['number-theory', 'elementary-number-theory', 'modular-arithmetic']"
