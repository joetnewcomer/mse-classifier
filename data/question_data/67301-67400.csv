Let $K \geq |S|$, I want to find the sum of all numbers with $K$ or less digits, whose nonzero digits exhaust the set $S$. To elaborate, suppose $K = 3$ and $S = \{1,1\}$. Then the numbers satisfying the criteria are $11,101$ and $110$ so the sum would be $222$. Now I want to consider large sets of numbers (for programming purposes), denote these by $S = \{d_1,\ldots,d_1,d_2,\ldots,d_2,\ldots d_j,\ldots,d_j\}$. I choose this notation to reflect the fact that there may be multiple duplicates and that not all the digits $1,\ldots, 9$ need to be included in the set. The way I want to attack this problem is by decomposing the numbers created by the digits into single digits numbers. I tried the following approach but I am not sure it is right: Extend the set $S$ by $K - |S|$ zeroes. Then using the elements in $S$ we can create exactly  $$ \frac{K!}{m_0!m_1!\cdots m_9!}$$ numbers, where $m_j$ denotes the multiplicity of $d_i$ in $S$. Now of these numbers, the fraction $ m_i / K$ will have $d_i$ as the last digit, and for the other digits the fraction is the same. Thus the total sum should be $$ \frac{K!}{m_0!m_1!\cdots m_9!} \cdot \underbrace{11 \ldots 11}_{k \ \text{times}} \cdot \sum\limits_{i=0}^9 d_i \frac{m_i}{K}.$$ The $\underbrace{11 \ldots 11}_{k \ \text{times}}$ reflects the sum of the weights the digits have at all possible positions. In the example I showed we would have $S = \{1,1,0\}$ and $K = 3$, giving the total sum of $$\frac{3!}{0!2!}\cdot 111 \cdot \left( 1 \cdot \frac{2}{3} \right) = 222,$$ which is correct. The formula can be rewritten as  $$ \frac{(K-1)!}{(K-|S|)!m_1!\cdots m_9!} \cdot \underbrace{11 \ldots 11}_{k \ \text{times}} \cdot \sum S.$$ I wrote a small algorithm that implements this method of calculating the sum as well as a brute force implementation but the numbers do not seem to  match.

23,How to distribute three kinds of things of $2n$ each equally in between two people?,How to distribute three kinds of things of  each equally in between two people?,2n,"I have been working on this problem from Arthur Engel's problem solving strategies and I need some help here. Here is the question. $2n$ objects each of $3$ kinds are given to two people in such a way that each person gets $3n$ objects. Prove that this can be done in $3n^2 + 3n + 1$ ways. I need help with two things.  1. To sort out my approach.  2. In understanding the enlightened approach of the book. Here is my approach. I noticed that this problem can be recast to be asking, how many ways can three numbers add up to give a sum of $3n$ with this constraint. $$a + b + c = 3n$$  $$ 0 \leq a, b, c \leq 2n$$ I also noticed that for each way we give these objects ne person, there is only one corresponding way to give it to the other person. So, to count the number of ways the distribution can be done, it is sufficient to count the number of ways one person is given the objects. Here, is what I've done. I fix the value of $a$, and then vary $b $and $c $. $$  \begin{align} 0 &&+ n &&+ 2n \\  0 &&+ n+1&& + 2n-1 \\  \vdots \\ 0 && + n + n && + 2n -n \end{align} $$ The $0$ can be placed in any box. So the total number of possibilities is $3\times(n+1)$. $$  \begin{align} 1 &&+ n -1&&+ 2n \\  1 &&+ n&& + 2n-1 \\  \vdots \\ 1 && + n + n && + 2n -(n+1) \end{align} $$ Similarly, the total number of ways this can be done is $3\times(n+2)$. $\vdots$ $$  \begin{align} n-1 &&+ 1 &&+ 2n \\  n-1&&+ 2&& + 2n-1\\  \vdots \\ n-1 && + 2n&& + 2n - (2n-1) \end{align} $$ The total number of ways is $3\times(2n)$. After this we stop because if $a = n $, one of the other two become $0$ and this possibility is already counted. So the total number of ways is... $$3( n + 1 + n + 2 + \dots + n + n)$$ which is not the required answer. Creative approach : I didn't understand the creative approach at all.

25,Help With a Card Game,Help With a Card Game,,"Intro A friend of mine is trying to create a real time card game where players try to match images on cards in their hand to another card that is in play. Example: Player 1 plays a card with images {a, b, c}. Another player could play a card with any of a, b, or c on it. That is {a, d, e}, {b, d, e}, {c, d, e} all match at exactly one of the images on the card in play ({a, b, c}). We're trying to understand how to setup this game such that: 1) Each card with N images is guaranteed to match at least N other cards (no orphaned images). Example: the card {a, b, c} would match at least 3 other cards. One for each of a, b, and c. 2) No two cards match in more than one way. Example {a, b, c} and {a, b, d} cannot exist in the deck as both {a, b} match these two cards. At most one image should match (just {a}, just {b}, or just {c}). 3) In reality we'd like to have 8 images per card and have a deck of at least 50 cards. So instead of cards that look like {a, b, c}, we'd really have cards with 8 images and they'd look something like {a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h}. Question 1) How many images will we need to create to support this scheme? I've looked into building the deck as a collection of fully connected graphs which would ensure that each images on every card is ""connected"" to another unique card, but the number images needed grows quite quickly. Example: To get a set of cards with 8 images on it, I see 9 vertices (cards) in a fully connected graph which requires no less than 36 images (just for 9 cards!). This is K9 in the fully connected graph link. 2) Is there some type of pseudocode or algorithm to help us build this out programatically? Ideally we'd like to adjust it so that we can affect the probability of matches. Example: In the fully connected graph scheme, each card matches every other card (which means you can always just play whatever is in your hand). We'd ideally like a scheme where every card matches something like 1/3 or 1/4 of the deck's card population so that there's some degree of skill involved. It would be nice if the algorithm/pseudocode allowed us to affect the probability of cards matching. Can someone help me understand this problem from at math perspective?

Suppose we have N blue counters, N red counters, N white counters, and so forth, K colours in total. We distribute them into B >= K buckets, such that there are not more than N counters in each. Show that we can always pick K different-coloured counters from a set of K different buckets (one from each). (In the TopCoder problem K was fixed at 3, but here it's arbitrary.) Intuitively this seems simple. I'm looking for a satisfactory simple argument, but I just can't see it. I only have the argument below, which seems more complex than necessary. Using an induction argument, assume we can already pick Q < K different-coloured counters from Q different buckets. Now we'll attempt to show that Q+1 is possible. If there is a colour we haven't yet picked in a bucket we haven't yet picked, pick it and we're finished. Otherwise, counters of this next colour (let's say ""red"" for simplicity) are in a subset of buckets that we have already picked. Divide the set of buckets into 3 sets: (1) currently picked & with red counters, (2) currently picked & no red counters, (3) non-picked & no red counters. Consider the first of these sets. There are Z buckets with at least Z+1 colours (because there is red too). As there are at most NZ counters in total in these, while there are N*(Z+1) counters of these colours altogether, there must be at least N counters of these colours in some of the other two sets. If this is in the last set, then it's easy to see what to do to get Q+1. The remaining case is if it's in the middle set. The rest of the argument refers to the following diagram: The diagram shows that when it's in the middle set, we use the same argument again to show that there have to be some of the left-of-the-line picked counters beyond the boundary. Continuing in the same way, the boundary will be pushed until, eventually, there will be some of our counters in the third set. Every time it's pushed, an arrow is drawn from a picked counter on the left of the line to similarly-coloured counters to the right of the line. When we eventually reach the unpicked set, the third diagram shows that there will be a bunch of arrows all going diagonally left to right. All arrows have unique colour. And the thick red arrow shows how to follow the arrows to update the choice of which colour counter is picked from each bucket to get Q+1.

66,Counting elements in cartesian power with plurality + pattern constraints,Counting elements in cartesian power with plurality + pattern constraints,,"Problem : I have an alphabet with n=8 letters (say $X=\{A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H\}$). I'm looking for words with m=24 letters, with three constraints : letter $A$ is the relative majority (like in $ABCAAFFHABCAAFFHABCAAFFH$ where $A$ appears 9 times, i.e., more than all other letters) (we could use ""plurality"" for this concept). one letter at one position is fixed (two cases: an $A$ or another letter) the general pattern $p$ is fixed (by pattern, I mean $ABCAFHABCAFHABCAFH$ for the previous example, i.e., the order, without the number of letters) (let's define $p_A$ the number of $A$'s in the pattern. Here, $p_A=6$. Let's also define $p_{A1}$ the number of $A$'s in the first interval in the pattern. Here, $p_{A1}=1$.) Simple example : with $X=\{A, B, C\}$ and $n=8$. The question is: how many eight-letter words with an $A$ in the third position have a (relative) majority of $A$'s and the pattern $BABCA$? And how many have a (relative) majority of $B$'s? Solution for the simple example : The fixed $A$ cannot be in the second $A$-interval in the pattern: $A$ is the last letter in the pattern, and so the fixed $A$ can be followed only by other $A$'s and the pattern would not be reproduced. Still, in general cases, the fixed $A$ could be in different intervals. Once we have decided that $A$ is in the first interval, we iterate on $k$, the number of $A$-letter in the word. There must be at least one in each interval, thus at least two in this example. With $k=2$ and $k=3$, there are no possible outcome, since there would be $k$ $A$'s letters and $k-1$ other letters ($B$ and $C$). Since there are only three letters, we cannot make an 8-letter word ($2+1*2, 3+2*2 \leq 8$).

In total: $3\times 2=6$ possibilities. $AAAB, AAAC, AABA, AACA, BAAA, CAAA$ With $k=2$ elements being $A$'s, there is an extra-challenge: the two remaining positions should not be the same, otherwise $A$'s are not a majority anymore. About locating the $A$'s, one is fixed in the second position and the other $A$ can be in position $(1)$, $(3)$ or $(4)$: 3 possibilities. In the two remaining positions, there are 2 possibilities for the first one ($B$ or $C$ but not $A$) and 1 possibility for the second one (not $A$ and not the same than the first one). Total: 6 possibilities. $AABC, AACB, BAAC, CAAB, BACA, CABA$ With $k=1$ element being $A$, there are zero possibilities for $A$ to be a majority (three remaining possibilities, with only two letters, $B$ and $C$, so necessarily a majority of $B$ or $C$). So with $n=4$ and 3 elements in the original set, there are 13 possibilities. General solution? Is there a closed form formula to compute this number?

Of course, it is not literally the min cut problem, being a problem lying within a Euclidean space.  But it's not even that there exists a bijection between the set of feasible points for this second (dual) problem and min cut that preserves the ordering on the objective values.  In fact, min cut is an optimization problem over finitely many points, namely $2^{|V|}$ of them.  A friend told me what may be intended is that the vertices of the polytope constituting the feasible region are in bijection with the cuts.  Optimal values must occur on vertices.  Even if so, this seems only as much of an equivalence as saying ""they're equivalent because the optimal values are always the same."" But even this weak ""equivalence"" is one I cannot see.

Then we set the rest of the $a_{ie}=-a_{i-|V|+2\,e}$.  We set $b$ to be the capacities in the first $E$ slots and then $0$ after that.

This task is about Inclusion-exclusion principle, but I can't understand. Can anyone explain me how to solve this task? thanks edit:I have understood the complexity of this question just now. A real task also describe, that: sequence can't have any of words {ARZEN,DRAK,DUM,DURAZ}. That means that sequence "" A B D R K Z M E N U I"" also should not be counted, because the bold letters form the forbidden word ARZEN .

Show that the number of order ideals equals the number of antichains.,P,"Can someone please verify my proof or offer suggestions for improvement? I am aware that there are similar questions posted elsewhere, but I need help with my proof in particular. Some preliminaries: Let $P$ be a poset. An antichain $C$ is a subset of $P$ such that for all $x, y \in C$ with $x \neq y$, $x$ is incomparable with $y$. An order ideal $I$ is a subset of $P$ such that $x \in I$ and $y \leq x$ implies $y \in I$. Let $P$ be a finite poset. Show that the number of order ideals equals the number of antichains. Let $I$ be an order ideal, and let $M$ be the set of maximal elements of $I$. Then, $M$ is an antichain in $P$ (Let $x, y \in M$ with $x \neq y$. If $x \leq y$, then $x$ is not a maximal element of $I$, a contradiction.) Let $I_1$ and $I_2$ be two order ideals in $P$ with the same set of maximal elements $M$. We show that it must be the case that $I_1 = I_2$. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists an $x \in I_2$ such that $x \notin I_1$. Then, it must either be the case that $x \leq m$ for some  maximal element $m$, or $x$ is incomparable with every maximal element.

Since there is a one-to-one correspondence between the order ideals and the antichains in $P$, and $P$ is finite, it must be the case that the number of order ideals and antichains in $P$ are equal.","Can someone please verify my proof or offer suggestions for improvement?
