A safety lock on a brief case has a keypad. It is unlocked by pressing four digits each in the range $0$ to $9$ inclusive in succession. Mechanical restrictions imply that no single digit features more than once in the code and the order of pressing of the four digits is irrelevant. How many distinct combinations can there be? A thief has stolen the brief case and is attempting to open it by trying different combinations. It takes $5$ seconds for him to key in one combination. If he does this systematically   using a prepared list of numbers, What is the maximum time elapsed before he must succeed? What is the time elapsed by which he has a $50\%$ chance of success? So my solutions are as follows: For the number of combinations we are essentially looking at $10\times 9 \times 8=720$ possible combinations. For 1. I believe it would take him an hour to crack open the case as, the last set of numbers of the prepared could be the combination he looking for. So my calculation $720\times5=3600~\text{s}=1~\text{hr}$ Question 2 is the part that tripping me up as, he has $50\%$ chance of success, so originally I thought well this is half the number of combinations which mean that he would then only take $30$ min to crack the case.

A safety lock on a brief case has a keypad. It is unlocked by pressing four digits each in the range to inclusive in succession. Mechanical restrictions imply that no single digit features more than once in the code and the order of pressing of the four digits is irrelevant. How many distinct combinations can there be? A thief has stolen the brief case and is attempting to open it by trying different combinations. It takes seconds for him to key in one combination. If he does this systematically   using a prepared list of numbers, What is the maximum time elapsed before he must succeed? What is the time elapsed by which he has a chance of success? So my solutions are as follows: For the number of combinations we are essentially looking at possible combinations. For 1. I believe it would take him an hour to crack open the case as, the last set of numbers of the prepared could be the combination he looking for. So my calculation Question 2 is the part that tripping me up as, he has chance of success, so originally I thought well this is half the number of combinations which mean that he would then only take min to crack the case.

Bogart's book ""Combinatorics through guided discovery"" which can be freely downloaded at https://math.dartmouth.edu/news-resources/electronic/kpbogart/FDL-bogart/kpbogart-FDL.tar.gz The question sounds very simple and, I thought the solution was $C_{(2n, 2)}$ which after some simple algebra yields $C_{(2n,2)} = n(2n - 1)$. For a simple (and manually verifiable) case of 10 members, thus $n = 5$, it leads to the answer 45 ways which is the same result as the one obtained from $C_{(10,2)}$. The answer in the book bears no resemblence to that. Specifically, quoting from the book 12. A tennis club has $2n$ members. We want to pair up the members by twos for singles matches. (a) In how many ways may we pair up all the members of the club? (Hint: consider the cases of 2, 4, and 6 members.) Solution: Suppose we list the people in the club in some way (perhaps in alphabetical order), and keep that list for the remainder of the problem. Take the ﬁrst person from the list and pair that person with any of the $2n − 1$ remaining people. Now take the next unpaired person from the list and pair that person with any of the remaining $2n − 3$ unpaired people. Continuing in this way, once k pairs have been selected, take the next unpaired person from the list and pair that person with any of the remaining $2n − 2k − 1$ unpaired people. Every pairing can arise in this way, and no pairing can arise twice in this process. Thus the number of outcomes is $$\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}2n − 2i − 1$$. This is the product of the odd numbers between 1 and $2n − 1$. It is also the product of every second term of $(2n)!$. Notice that the other n terms of $(2n)!$ are even. In fact, if we double each term of n!, we would get the missing terms of (2n)!. Thus $$(2n)! = 2^n n! \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 2n - 2i - 1$$ Therefore the number of tennis pairings is $$\frac{(2n)!}{2^n\ n!}$$. end quote from the book I do not see how the number of outcomes ends up as the product  $$\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}2n − 2i − 1$$  I see a sum of elements of disjoint sets not a product. for $2n = 10$ , I see $$C_{10,2} = 45$$ his solution yields $$\frac{(10)!}{2^5\ 5!} = 945$$ That's 900 additional pairs that I do not see.
