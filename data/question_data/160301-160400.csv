0,Are numbers with repeating patterns in their decimal expansion (e.g. $0.123123123\ldots$) rational?,Are numbers with repeating patterns in their decimal expansion (e.g. ) rational?,0.123123123\ldots,"There's a question that I've been thinking about for quite some time now. We all know that numbers with infinite decimal expansion such as $0.\overline{3}$ or $0.\overline{1}$ are not necessarily  irrational.  $$0.\overline{3}=0.333333\dots=\frac{1}{3}$$ $$0.\overline{1}=0.111111\ldots=\frac{1}{9}$$ Therefore we can say that for instance $0.\overline{4}$ is rational because we have: $$0.\overline{4}=4\cdot 0.\overline{1}=\frac{4}{9}$$ My question is: can we generalize these results to any number that has a repeating pattern in its decimal expansion? Can we claim for instance that $0.\overline{123}=0.123123123\ldots$ is rational? This question boils down to asking whether or not expressions like $0.\overline{01}$ and $0.\overline{001}$ etcetera are rational. If so, in the case of my example we could say: $$0.\overline{123}=123\cdot 0.\overline{001}$$ A naive thought of mine was that $0.\overline{01}$ is simply $\frac{1}{10}\cdot 0.\overline{1}$ but this is of course not true. Then I thought that maybe we can represent $0.\overline{01}$ as $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{10^{2i}}$ which converges by the ratio test. However this does not tell us if it is rational or not. This is not for homework or anything, just something I've been thinking about and I was wondering if any of you have some knowledge about this issue.

Here is the proof that was provided to us in the solutions: Let $p$ be a prime number. If $k$ is an integer satisfying $1 \leq k \leq p-1$ , then $k! = 1\cdot2\cdot3\cdot\cdot\cdot k$ is a product of positive integeres smaller than $p$ , and therefore $k!$ is not divisible by $p$ . For the same reason, if $1 \leq k \leq p-1$ then $(p-k)! = 1\cdot2\cdot3\cdot\cdot\cdot (p-k)$ is not divisible by $p$ . Since $p!$ obviously is divisible by $p$ , we infer that $\binom{p}{k} = \frac{p!}{k!(p-k)!} \equiv 0$ mod $p$ whenever $1 \leq k \leq p-1$ . Therefore $(x + y)^p = x^p + y^p +\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} \binom{p}{k}x^k y^{p-k} \equiv x^p +y^p$ mod $p$ . Q.E.D. I'm having trouble understanding a few things about this theorem and proof. First, I'm not quite seeing the congruence (if that makes any sense). Like, I'm not seeing how $(x+y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 \equiv x^2 + y^2$ mod $2$ , or rather just in general for any power $p$ , not just $2$ . I recall that we say $a \mid b$ if there exists some $c$ such that $ac = b$ , and that we say if $a,b \in \Bbb Z$ and $n \in \Bbb N$ , $a$ is congruent to $b$ modulo $n$ if and only if $n\mid (b-a)$ . This is written as $a \equiv b$ (mod $n$ ) where $n$ is called the modulus, and from this we get residue classes $r$ that are all the sets of numbers of the form $a = bn + r$ where $r \in \{0,1,2,\cdot\cdot\cdot, n-1\}$ . I'm not quite sure how to phrase that but I can picture what it's supposed to be in my head. I saw that in an answer listed here Proving $(a+b)^{p} \equiv a^{p} + b^{p} \pmod{p}$ for prime $p$ that someone says ""because nothing in the denominator divides $n$ . So all of the middle terms in the expansion of $(a+b)^p$ vanish modulo $p$ , and you're left with the two ends: $a^p+b^p$ ."" But it still isn't making sense to me. How is it that because the denominator doesn't divide the numerator, all the messy middle terms disappear? The next question I have is why go about proving it this way? What is the motivation for the techniques used to prove this statement? When I first saw this problem, admittedly I didn't know where to start.

So far, I've only managed to break it into some cases. $(ab,p)=1$ implies $(a,p)=(b,p)=1$ and $\left(\frac{-ab}{p}\right)=\left(\frac{-1}{p}\right)\left(\frac{a}{p}\right)\left(\frac{b}{p}\right)$, so if $\left(\frac{a}{p}\right)=\left(\frac{b}{p}\right)=1$ or $-1$, then $\left(\frac{ab}{p}\right)=1$, so I want to show there are $p-(-1)^{(p-1)/2}$ solutions. Similarly, if $\left(\frac{a}{p}\right)=1$ and $\left(\frac{b}{p}\right)=-1$, I need to show there are $p+(-1)^{(p-1)/2}$ solutions.

While browsing tonight, I came across this challenge problem in one of my books: Suppose that $(ab,p)=1$ and that $p>2$. Show that the number of solutions $(x,y)$ of the congruence $ax^2+by^2\equiv 1\pmod{p}$ is $p-\left(\frac{-ab}{p}\right)$. After experimenting with it for a few hours, I've barely gotten anywhere. So far, I've only managed to break it into some cases. $(ab,p)=1$ implies $(a,p)=(b,p)=1$ and $\left(\frac{-ab}{p}\right)=\left(\frac{-1}{p}\right)\left(\frac{a}{p}\right)\left(\frac{b}{p}\right)$, so if $\left(\frac{a}{p}\right)=\left(\frac{b}{p}\right)=1$ or $-1$, then $\left(\frac{ab}{p}\right)=1$, so I want to show there are $p-(-1)^{(p-1)/2}$ solutions. Similarly, if $\left(\frac{a}{p}\right)=1$ and $\left(\frac{b}{p}\right)=-1$, I need to show there are $p+(-1)^{(p-1)/2}$ solutions. In the first case, $a$ and $b$ would both be quadratic residues modulo $p$, and hence $c^2\equiv a\pmod{p}$ and $d^2\equiv b\pmod{p}$ for some $c,d$. Then the original problem would come to $(cx)^2+(dy)^2\equiv 1\pmod{p}$, but I'm not sure a sum of squares is any better. Is there a slick solution to a problem like this?, I'm very puzzled over it.",,"['number-theory', 'modular-arithmetic']"

After a lot of work I could show that each $b$ that satisfies this equation corresponds to another smaller integer say $s$ which satisfies the equation. here are the formulas for the solutions. $$t=s\pm\sqrt{2s^2+1}\tag{1}$$ $$x=3t\pm2\sqrt{2t^2-1}\tag{2}$$ $$y=\pm\sqrt{tx-1}\tag{3}$$ $$b=2x+y\tag{4}$$ $$a=3x+y\tag{5}$$ for nonzero $t$ and $x$ . Let $x_+$ and $x_-$ denote the $x$ with the positive sign and negative sign respectively and define $y_+$ and $y_-$ similarly. Use the following rules: If you choose positive $t$ not $1$ you may  choose any one of the $x$ s, but you must choose $y_+$ if you take $x_+$ . If $t=1$ you may take both $x$ s and with $x_+$ you must choose only $y_+$ . If you take $t$ positive and choose $x_-$ you must choose $y_-$ , this last solution repeats the previous solutions but it generates one the others don't when $s=2$ , $t=5$ , $x_-=1$ , $y_-=-2$ , $b=0$ , $a=1$ . There are similar rules for negative $t$ but they are just the negatives of the previous solutions. I (think) I could prove that no $s$ can lead to a $b=s$ since all solutions either get smaller or larger but the absolute value always increases except for the case I singled out which leads to $b=0$ , which implies that this is the complete set of solutions. I noticed that the values of $b$ increase and at some point they reach a constant ratio which is roughly $\phi=93222358/15994428$ and I used this to derive the function $$f(x)=\phi^{\left(x-11\right)}93222358$$ which is extremely accurate at first and almost exact for $x\ge7$ . It gives the $x$ -th nonzero value of $b$ where the zeroth value is just $0$ . Here's where it gets interesting, I noticed a pattern among the $a$ s, that for nonzero even $x$ , $a$ can be written in the form $a=c_1^2-1$ and for odd $x$ , $a=\ c_2^2+1$ . I checked this until $x=15$ and it holds. Also, another reason to believe that $a$ can't be a square is that while I was trying to prove Fermat's last theorem for $n=4$ (where this equation came up), I could reduce the proof to verifying that that no such $a$ can be a square.

The following is my attempt. Assume $x^2 \equiv 1 \pmod {p^k}$. Then $p^k | (x-1)(x+1) \Rightarrow p^k|(x-1)$ or $p^k|(x+1)$, because if $p^k$ can divide both, then $p^k|2$ which is false. This shows the forward direction. The converse is easy. For any $y^2 \equiv 1 \pmod {p^k}$, $y^2 \equiv x^2 \pmod {p^k}$ which yields the conclusion before, so $\pm 1$ are the only solutions $\pmod {p^k}$.",,"['number-theory', 'elementary-number-theory', 'quadratic-residues']"
