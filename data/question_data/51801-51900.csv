I have never seen a book that proves that there is in fact no analogous formula for the integral of a product. Some books prove that there is no formula for the roots of a general 5th degree or higher polynomial function. Can someone prove that there is no such formula for the integral of a product? There is a formula for the integral of a sum, so maybe someone will discover that there is a formula for the integral of a product. I apologize if my notion of formula is not precise enough, but maybe there is a book that precisely defines what a formula is.",,"['calculus', 'integration', 'closed-form', 'products']"
