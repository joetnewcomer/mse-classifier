Let $p$ be a line passing through $A$ that intersects circles $c$ and $d$ at points $P_1$ and $P_2$ . Construct a circle tangential to $p$ and orthogonal to both $c$ and $d$ . What I did was that I constructed a circle $k=k(P, |PS_1|)$ so that $P$ is the midpoint of $S_1S_2$ . Then I applied  inversion about $k$ , which maps  circles $c$ and $d$ to two parallel lines $c'$ and $d'$ , and  line $p$ to circle $p'$ that passes through point $P$ . Then I found line $l$ such that it's  perpendicular to $c'$ and $d'$ and tangential to circle $p '$ . Finally, I applied inversion about $k$ again so it would map $l$ to circle $l'$ .

1,A planar cut through an oblique cone,A planar cut through an oblique cone,,"An oblique cone has a circular base centered at the origin of radius $5$ , and an apex at $(0, 5, 20)$ .  A plane whose equation is $3x-4y+5z = 40$ cuts through the oblique cone, and the resulting cut is an ellipse.  Find the equation of the ellipse in the form: $ P(t) = C + w_1 \cos t + w_2 \sin t $ where $C$ is the center and $w_1$ and $w_2$ are the vectors specifying the semi-minor and semi-major axes of the ellipse. My Attempt: My attempt is incomplete, but the basic idea I am following is to parameterize the plane, as follows, $ r = r_0 + V u $ and then plug this into the equation of the cone, which I don't have. So I still have to find a way to find the algebraic (implicit) equation of the cone.  And from there, it should be straight forward to write a quadratic form in $u$ which will give the two axes of the cut ellipse.

5,A ternary relation on a group,A ternary relation on a group,,"Let $G$ be a group. Consider the ternary relation $R \subset G^3$ defined by $$R(x,y,z) \Leftrightarrow x y^{-1} z x^{-1} y z^{-1} = 1 $$ Show that $R$ is a symmetric relation, that is if $R(x,y,z)$ , then $R(x',y',z')$ for all permutations $(x',y',z')$ of $(x,y,z)$ . Notes The expression above can be encountered in Pappus' theorem . There the group $G$ is the $2\times 2$ lower triangular matrices. For the case when $R$ is a ternary equivalence relation , see the paper ""Groups with a ternary equivalence relation"". This is where it was stated that the symmetry holds for all groups $G$ ( a surprise! ). $\bf{Added:}$ There were some very crisp answers. From what I understand, one idea seems to be this: Consider the $n$ -ary relation on a group $G$ $$E(x_1, \ldots, x_n) \Leftrightarrow x_1 \cdots x_n= 1$$ Then $E$ is invariant under cyclic permutations, and also $$x_1 \cdots x_n = 1 \implies x_n^{-1} \cdots x_1^{-1} = 1$$ These two properties take care of the proof. We also get $$R(x,y,z) \implies R(x^{-1}, y^{-1}, z^{-1})$$ and $$R(x,y,z) \implies R(a x, a y , a z), R(xa, y a, z a)$$ I've found another way to express $R$ : Note that if $x y^{-1} = w$ , $z x^{-1} = v$ , $y z^{-1} = u$ , then $x = w y$ , $z = v x$ , $y = u z$ .  So $w$ , $v$ , $y$ are (left) displacements. Now it is easy to see that $$u v w = y z^{-1} \cdot z x^{-1} \cdot x y^{-1} = 1$$ But the condition says that on top of this we have $w v u = 1$ . This is equivalent to $u$ , $v$ , $w$ commute. So that is the meaning of $R$ : the (left) displacements corresponding to $x$ , $y$ , $z$ commute. It is now easy to see why this condition is symmetric.  Moreover it is equivalent to the condition for the right displacements. This gets us back to the problem where this expression originates. In the Pappus theorem, the projections from one line to another through one of the points $X$ , $Y$ , $Z$ are elements of $PGL(2, k)$ . We have the condition $R$ if and only if the points $X$ , $Y$ , $Z$ are collinear. That means that the relation $R$ has the property $$R(x,y,z) \& R(x,z, t) \implies R(x,y,t)$$ Now, the paper quoted above does state some theorems, but the fact is this: $R$ satisfies the above ( similar to collinearity) if and only if the commutant of any non-trivial element is abelian. This can be expressed as follows: the relation $x \simeq y$ on $G \backslash \{e\}$ if $x$ , $y$ commute is an $equivalence$ relation (    a CA-group ). One should check that for the group $G = PGL(2, k)$ it is true that the centralizer of any element $\ne 1$ is abelian .","Let be a group.

The idea is to start with a dodecahedron where each of the 20 vertices has a counter on it and each of the 12 faces is a button.

Clearly the sum of the counters must be a multiple of 5, but i don't think that this necessary condition is sufficient as there are less faces than vertices. It's easy enough to create a 20x12 matrix that shows each vertex counter's value in terms of the 12 faces.

Now, here's the part I'm confused about: Deriving the equation of the circle depended on the definition of the circle, and the definition of distance between two points on the Cartesian plane. How do we prove that plotting all the points which satisy the equation of a circle will actually be a circle on the Cartesian plane. For example - if the definition of distance were changed, the 'circle' might look completely different on the plane. Or if the plane were 'bent' a circle would also look different. I assume that the definition of a circle does not change in these cases - it's just that the circle 'looks' different from what we expect. So how do we proceed that the circle still looks like a circle on the Cartesian Plane? In fact, for any equation, how do we prove that the graph is correct? For example, for a parabola, we could plot a large number of points, and then demonstrate that it forms a pattern that looks like a parabola- but the unplotted points could still break this pattern.

So we have $\sqrt{2}^n\le S_n \le 2^n$ and thus $$\left( \frac{nS_n}{S_{n-1}}\right)^{1/n} \le \left( \frac{n2^n}{\sqrt{2}^{n-1}} \right)^{1/n} = n^{1/n}2^{\frac{n+1}{2n}} = n^{1/n}\sqrt{2}\sqrt{2}^{1/n}.$$ So if we take $n^{1/n} \le 2$ and $\sqrt{2}^{1/n}\le \sqrt{2}^{1/2}$, then an upper bound to my problem is $2^{1+3/4}$ which isn't good enough.

52,Dividing a square into two regions with minimal interface,Dividing a square into two regions with minimal interface,,"We want to divide a unit square into a black region of given area $A\in[0,1]$ and a white region of area $1-A$, while minimizing the interface perimeter between the two regions. Let's say both regions must be contiguous. Note that without loss of generality, we may consider the restricted range $A\in\left[0,\frac{1}{2}\right]$, because we can always swap the black and white regions. A simple way of dividing the square into two regions is to draw a straight line parallel to two of the sides (right figure). This works for any area, and has an interface perimeter of $P=1$, regardless of the area. Another solution* is to draw a quadrant, centered at one of the square's corners (left figure). Clearly, we can enclose more than half of the area with this method, so it can be used for any given $A$. Using simple geometry, we can show that to enclose an area $A<\frac{1}{2}$, the interface perimeter will be $P = \sqrt{\pi} \sqrt{A}$. This means that the quadrant is a better solution than the line when $\sqrt{\pi}\sqrt{A}<1$, or $A<\frac{1}{\pi}$, and a candidate optimal (?) solution would be: My question is: Is there a solution better than the one above? If not, how can we prove that this solution is optimal? Bonus question: Does the optimal solution change if the regions are not required to be contiguous? *Other solutions such as a full circle, a semi-circle using the border as a diameter, a square using the borders as two of the sides, and a diagonal line at 45 degrees all do worse than the quadrant for any $A$, and therefore cannot feature in an optimal solution.","We want to divide a unit square into a black region of given area $A\in[0,1]$ and a white region of area $1-A$, while minimizing the interface perimeter between the two regions.

The following excerpt is taken from Einstein Gravity in a Nutshell by Zee, page 66 The logic of differential geometry Differential geometry, as developed by Gauss and Riemann, tells us that given the metric, we can calculate the curvature. The logic goes as follows. The metric tells you the distance between two nearby points. Integrating, you can obtain the distance along any curve joining two points, not necessarily nearby. Find the curve with the shortest distance. By definition, this curve is the ""straight line"" between these two points. Once you know how to find the ""straight line"" between any two points, you can test all of Euclid’s theorems to see whether our space is flat. For example, as described in the prologue, the mite geometers could now draw a small circle around any point, measure its circumference, and see if it is equal to $2\pi$ times the radius.

But now if I also give you the distances between Rome and each of these three cities, you would find that you can’t extend the triangle to a planar quadrangle (figure 1). So the distances between four points suffice to prove that the world is not flat. But the metric tells you the distances between an infinite number of points. I have looked up distances between these four cities on WolframAlpha: Barcelona - Berlin: 1498 km http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=distance+barcelona+berlin Bacelona - Paris: 829.2 km http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=distance+barcelona+paris Barcelona - Rome: 861.8 km http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=distance+rome+barcelona Berlin - Paris: 878.7 km http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=distance+berlin+paris Berlin - Rome: 1184 km http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=distance+berlin+rome Paris - Rome: 1109 km http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=distance+paris+rome $$\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}   \hline     & \text{Bar} & \text{Ber} & \text{Rom} & \text{Par} \\\hline   \text{Bar} & 0 & 1498 & 861.8  & 829.2\\\hline   \text{Ber} &   & 0 & 1184 & 878.7 \\\hline   \text{Rom} &   &   & 0 & 1109 \\\hline   \text{Par} &   &   &   & 0 \\\hline \end{array}$$",,"['geometry', 'differential-geometry', 'euclidean-geometry', 'quadrilateral']"

And this really is the definition from Wikipedia : Two line segments are congruent if they have the same length. But in Hilbert's Foundations of Geometry congruence is defined without use of metric notions, by the axioms of Group IV (chapter 6). I don't report here these axioms that can be found on the book (or on the Wiki page ) and essentially say that congruence is an equivalence relation and that congruence is conserved when we add adjacent segments. Usually these axioms are illustrated with a figure that use two segments $AB$ and $A'B'$ that have the same length, as in this case. but I think that this illustration is only dictated by our intuition of congruence as equality of length, and it's not justified by the axioms. Look at the second figure, where $a$,$a'$ and $a''$ are straight lines and $E$ is a point that does not belong to these lines. Projecting from $E$ the points $A,B,C$ of $a$ to the other lines, we can define the relation: $$ AB \equiv A'B' \quad BC \equiv B'C' $$  and $$ A'B' \equiv A''B'' \quad B'C' \equiv B''C'' $$ and we can see that this relation satisfies all axioms of congruence.

I would be grateful for any suggestions on: how to prove by an alternative method, e.g. probabalistic how to streamline the proof how to make the proof more rigorous Formulation Prove the worst case where there is at least one limiting triangle that could not be covered if it were scaled up in size by any factor exceeding 1. That is, apply a uniform scaling to the set of points until there is at least one limiting triangle. The notion of limiting triangle is important because there is then a unique circle that covers the triangle; the circle will not cover the entire triangle if it is translated by any nonzero amount in any direction from the covering position. We distinguish two cases: There is a limiting triangle(s) that is right or obtuse All limiting triangle(s) are acute Case 1: Limiting Triangle is Right or Obtuse By comparison with a right triangle whose longest side is on the diameter of the covering circle, we see that any triangle with a diametral side will have its other vertex outside the circle if and only if the angle at this vertex is $<90^\circ$, and will have its other vertex on or inside the circle otherwise. So a right or obtuse triangle can be covered by a unit circle if and only if its longest side is $\le 2$ units in length. The longest side is the sole limiting feature of a non-acute triangle. In the diagram below, $AB$ is the longest side and $\angle ACB = 90^\circ, \angle AC'B > 90^\circ, \angle ADB < 90^\circ$. Then if any other point (say $D$) is outside the circle with diameter AB, we have a triangle $\Delta ABD$ that cannot be covered by a unit circle (because $AB$ is limiting), which contradicts the original stipulation that any three points forms a triangle that is coverable. Hence, there are no points outside the unit circle with $AB$ diametral. This proves case 1. What suggestions for making the above argument more rigorous? Case 2: Limiting Triangle is Acute When the limiting triangle is acute, its circumcenter will coincide with the center of the covering circle. We first need to prove: Lemma 1 : If a triangle is acute and all its vertices lie on a circle, then no larger circle can cover the triangle. With reference to the diagram below, for an acute triangle the circumcenter is inside the triangle. If the covering circle is translated in a direction that is not aligned with, say, $AB$, then it will need to move in a general direction away from vertex $C$, as indicated by the arrows. It is impossible to satisfy all three sets of requirements (relative to all sides), so the covering circle is unique and the triangle limiting. This argument relies on the circumcenter being inside the triangle, and hence does not work for obtuse triangles (nor should it) . This proves the lemma. What suggestions for making the above argument more rigorous, or streamlining it? Now suppose that we have a limiting triangle $\Delta ABC$ and a point $D'$ outside the covering circle for $\Delta ABC$, as per the next diagram. Construct point $D$ as the intersection of $AD'$ with the circle. Then show that a triangle with vertex $D$ is limiting, so that the analogous triangle with vertex $D'$ cannot be covered. Prove by contradiction. Suppose WLOG that $D\in\text{arc}\stackrel{\Large\frown}{BC}$. Suppose also that perpendiculars to $AB$ and to $AC$ cross at point $G$ inside the circle, and that $D\in\text{arc}\stackrel{\Large\frown}{FE}$ as shown, so that it not possible to find an acute (or right) triangle having $D$ as one vertex and having one of the sides of $\Delta ABC$ as a side. But in quadrilateral $ABGC$, for one pair of opposite angles $\angle ABG = \angle ACG = 90^\circ$, so $ABGC$ is a cyclic quadrilateral. So point $G$ is on the same circle as points $A,B,C$ thereby showing that points $E,F,G$ coincide. Hence, it is not possible to have $D\in\text{arc}\stackrel{\Large\frown}{FE}$, so $D$ must form an acute or right triangle with one side of $\Delta ABC$, e.g. if $D\in\text{arc}\stackrel{\Large\frown}{BG}$ we have acute triangle $\Delta ADC$. Then $\Delta ADC$ is limiting, so $\Delta AD'C$ cannot be covered as required. Otherwise, $D\in\text{arc}\stackrel{\Large\frown}{GC}$ and the argument is similar, or points $D$ and $G$ coincide and $\Delta ACD$ is a right triangle, so we then proceed as in Case 1. This proves Case 2.","A set of points is marked on the plane, with the property that any three marked   points can be covered with a disk of radius 1.

With reference to the diagram below, for an acute triangle the circumcenter is inside the triangle. If the covering circle is translated in a direction that is not aligned with, say, $AB$, then it will need to move in a general direction away from vertex $C$, as indicated by the arrows. It is impossible to satisfy all three sets of requirements (relative to all sides), so the covering circle is unique and the triangle limiting. This argument relies on the circumcenter being inside the triangle, and hence does not work for obtuse triangles (nor should it) . This proves the lemma. What suggestions for making the above argument more rigorous, or streamlining it? Now suppose that we have a limiting triangle $\Delta ABC$ and a point $D'$ outside the covering circle for $\Delta ABC$, as per the next diagram. Construct point $D$ as the intersection of $AD'$ with the circle. Then show that a triangle with vertex $D$ is limiting, so that the analogous triangle with vertex $D'$ cannot be covered. Prove by contradiction. Suppose WLOG that $D\in\text{arc}\stackrel{\Large\frown}{BC}$. Suppose also that perpendiculars to $AB$ and to $AC$ cross at point $G$ inside the circle, and that $D\in\text{arc}\stackrel{\Large\frown}{FE}$ as shown, so that it not possible to find an acute (or right) triangle having $D$ as one vertex and having one of the sides of $\Delta ABC$ as a side. But in quadrilateral $ABGC$, for one pair of opposite angles $\angle ABG = \angle ACG = 90^\circ$, so $ABGC$ is a cyclic quadrilateral. So point $G$ is on the same circle as points $A,B,C$ thereby showing that points $E,F,G$ coincide. Hence, it is not possible to have $D\in\text{arc}\stackrel{\Large\frown}{FE}$, so $D$ must form an acute or right triangle with one side of $\Delta ABC$, e.g. if $D\in\text{arc}\stackrel{\Large\frown}{BG}$ we have acute triangle $\Delta ADC$. Then $\Delta ADC$ is limiting, so $\Delta AD'C$ cannot be covered as required. Otherwise, $D\in\text{arc}\stackrel{\Large\frown}{GC}$ and the argument is similar, or points $D$ and $G$ coincide and $\Delta ACD$ is a right triangle, so we then proceed as in Case 1. This proves Case 2.",,"['geometry', 'proof-verification', 'contest-math']"

Either, by some magic every smooth $\mathbb{R}$-variety can be embedded in $\mathbb{A}^m$ or more likely my intuition for ""what an $\mathbb{R}$-manifold should correspond to in the language of algebraic geometry"" (which is already very handwavy) is simply wrong. I guess it is rather the later, and I would be happy if anyone could help me clear my confusion.

92,Axis of rotation of composition of rotations (Artin's Algebra),Axis of rotation of composition of rotations (Artin's Algebra),,"Say $R_1$, $R_2$ are rotations in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with axes and angles $(v_1,\theta_1), (v_2,\theta_2)$ respectively. Since $SO_3$ is a group, we have that $R_2 \circ R_1$ is a rotation with some axis $v$. Is there a geometric way of finding $v$? This is problem 4.5.10 in Artin's Algebra . My attempts have included looking at $v$ as a differentiable function of $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$, writing out the corresponding matrix equations, staring at a wall, and guessing. Not sure where to go from here.","Say $R_1$, $R_2$ are rotations in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with axes and angles $(v_1,\theta_1), (v_2,\theta_2)$ respectively.

93,Determining the angles of a triangle given the ratio between its edges,Determining the angles of a triangle given the ratio between its edges,,"Given that a triangle has edges of ratio 2 : 3 : 4, the task is to determine the three angles, say in degrees. I started by drawing 4 cm segment on the paper, then drew perpendicular segments of lengths 2 and 3 cm going up from the endpoints of the original segment. With a compass I drew arcs from the endpoints of the perpendicular segments, and their intersection allowed me to determine a triangle s.t. its edges meet the 2 : 3 : 4 (cm) ratio requirement. Visually: As happy as I am for being able to construct the triangle, I don't quite know how to proceed. I feel that the 2-4 angle (sorry I forgot to label) is 45°, the 3-4 one 30°, leaving 105° for the 2-3 angle. But I need some guidance as to how to approach actually proving those (or if those guesses are wrong, how to determine the actual angles). Thanks in advance for any hints/suggestions.","Given that a triangle has edges of ratio 2 : 3 : 4, the task is to determine the three angles, say in degrees.

Just more of a sightseeing tour than anything. Whilst walking through a part of campus, I saw a brick wall that was built somewhat like this: I inquired about its curvy shape, and was told it was to save brick when building. I found this rather strange, considering each curve is one half times π times the diameter until it reached the same depth. And we know that the circumference will be larger than the diameter, so how could this save material of any kind? Was I just lied to? Thanks in advance, Joe","Recently, I visited a college.
