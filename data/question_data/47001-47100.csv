2,Interpretation of an equality: Area of regular polygon and the integral $\int_0^{\infty}\! \frac{\mathbb{d}x}{1+x^N}$,Interpretation of an equality: Area of regular polygon and the integral,\int_0^{\infty}\! \frac{\mathbb{d}x}{1+x^N},"Recently, I learned the integral from this post: $$\mathcal I=\int_0^{\infty}\! \frac{\mathbb{d}x}{1+x^N}=\frac{\pi/N}{\sin(\pi/N)}$$ This reminds me of the area of a regular polygon. Consider a $2N$ -gon with unit ""radius"". (Distance from centre to vertices) The area is given by $$A_{2N}=(2N)\left(\frac12\cdot 1^2\sin{\frac{2\pi}{2N}}\right)=\pi\cdot\frac{\sin(\pi/N)}{\pi/N}$$ Question Turns out we found the equality $$\frac{1}{A_{2N}}=\frac{1}{\pi}\int_0^{\infty}\! \frac{\mathbb{d}x}{1+x^N}$$ It may look like a coincidence, but is it? Do we have an interpretation of any kind for this equality? Thoughts The term $\frac{1}{A_{2N}}$ is equivalent to the probability of choosing a region with arbitrary boundary and squared unit area from a regular $2N$ -gon with unit ""radius"". Or, as @Thomas Andrews suggests, we may rewrite the equation as $$\frac{\pi}{A_{N}}=\int_0^{\infty}\! \frac{\mathbb{d}x}{1+x^{N/2}}, N\in\Bbb{N}$$","Recently, I learned the integral from this post: This reminds me of the area of a regular polygon.

11,Tricky contour integral resulting from the integration of $\sin ax / (x^2+b^2)$ over the positive halfline,Tricky contour integral resulting from the integration of  over the positive halfline,\sin ax / (x^2+b^2),"I am trying to evaluate the definite integral $$\int_0^\infty \frac{\sin ax\ dx}{x^2+b^2}$$ where $a,b>0$. This is a problem on an assignment for a class in complex variables. I understand the mechanics of contour integration, but I am stuck. (I have spoken to four classmates who are also stuck.) I would appreciate a small hint, such as a hint to point me toward the right contour, or a suggestion for how to modify one of my abandoned ideas (below) to make it work. (But please do not work out the whole integral; I want to do that myself.) Here is what I have tried so far: The integral from $-\infty$ to $\infty$ is zero because the function is odd, so the semicircular contour in the upper half-plane won't do anything. Viewing the integral as  $$ \mathrm{Im}\, \int_0^\infty \frac{e^{aiz}dz}{z^2+b^2}, $$  I tried integrating around the contour from $0$ to $R>0$, along the quarter-circle to $iR$, and back down to $0$, with an indentation at the pole at $bi$. The pole is simple so I can get the contribution from the indentation via the residue, and the contribution from the quarter-circle $\to 0$ as $R\to \infty$, but the problem is that I believe the integral along the segment of the imaginary axis from $iR$ to $0$ is imaginary (so contributes to the imaginary part) and blows up around the pole, and generally seems harder to deal with than the original integral. Viewing the integrand with either $\sin az$ or $e^{iaz}$ in the numerator, I tried integrating along the rectangle with vertices $0,R,R+ib,ib$, with an indentation at the vertex $ib$ due to the pole. Again, I don't know how to get control of the integral along the imaginary axis. I tried using integration by parts to get a cosine to come out, but the integrand remains odd so the upper half-plane semicircular contour still does no good. I had a crazy idea that I was unable to carry out. There exists some path thru the origin along which the integrand  $$ \frac{e^{aiz}dz}{z^2+b^2} $$  is pure real.  This path is the solution to an ordinary differential equation with boundary condition $y(0)=0$. If my calculations are right the equation is  $$ y'=\frac{2xy\cos ax-(b^2+x^2-y^2)\sin ax}{2xy\sin ax+(b^2+x^2-y^2)\cos ax}. $$ The idea was to integrate along $0$ to $R$, counterclockwise along the circle with radius $R$ till it hits this curve, and back to the origin along this curve. By construction, the integral along this last part doesn't contribute anything to the imaginary part; meanwhile the part of the circle in the upper half plane $\to 0$ as $R\to \infty$. The curve must lie entirely outside the upper half-plane or this would show that the original integral I'm trying to evaluate is zero (since the imaginary part of $2\pi i$ times the residue is zero), which isn't plausible. Evaluating the desired integral then rests on: (a) whether the pole in the lower half-plane ever gets enclosed by this contour (and I'm pretty sure it doesn't), and (b) if I can figure out what is going on with the integral along the part of the circle $|z|=R$ in the lower half-plane before it hits the curve; in particular, what its imaginary part is doing asymptotically as $R\to \infty$. However, I wasn't sure how to pursue these goals any further. Update: As it turns out, the assignment contained a typo and the integral was supposed to be $$\int_0^\infty \frac{\sin ax\ dx}{x(x^2+b^2)}$$ This makes the integrand even, so it is done easily with the half-circle contour in the upper half-plane.  I definitely learned more because of the typo.  Thanks all for your answers and comments.","I am trying to evaluate the definite integral $$\int_0^\infty \frac{\sin ax\ dx}{x^2+b^2}$$ where $a,b>0$.

I had a crazy idea that I was unable to carry out. There exists some path thru the origin along which the integrand  $$ \frac{e^{aiz}dz}{z^2+b^2} $$  is pure real.  This path is the solution to an ordinary differential equation with boundary condition $y(0)=0$. If my calculations are right the equation is  $$ y'=\frac{2xy\cos ax-(b^2+x^2-y^2)\sin ax}{2xy\sin ax+(b^2+x^2-y^2)\cos ax}. $$ The idea was to integrate along $0$ to $R$, counterclockwise along the circle with radius $R$ till it hits this curve, and back to the origin along this curve. By construction, the integral along this last part doesn't contribute anything to the imaginary part; meanwhile the part of the circle in the upper half plane $\to 0$ as $R\to \infty$. The curve must lie entirely outside the upper half-plane or this would show that the original integral I'm trying to evaluate is zero (since the imaginary part of $2\pi i$ times the residue is zero), which isn't plausible. Evaluating the desired integral then rests on: (a) whether the pole in the lower half-plane ever gets enclosed by this contour (and I'm pretty sure it doesn't), and (b) if I can figure out what is going on with the integral along the part of the circle $|z|=R$ in the lower half-plane before it hits the curve; in particular, what its imaginary part is doing asymptotically as $R\to \infty$. However, I wasn't sure how to pursue these goals any further. Update: As it turns out, the assignment contained a typo and the integral was supposed to be $$\int_0^\infty \frac{\sin ax\ dx}{x(x^2+b^2)}$$ This makes the integrand even, so it is done easily with the half-circle contour in the upper half-plane.  I definitely learned more because of the typo.  Thanks all for your answers and comments.",,"['integration', 'complex-analysis', 'contour-integration']"

25,Double integral separating real and imaginary parts of $\zeta (\sigma+i t)$,Double integral separating real and imaginary parts of,\zeta (\sigma+i t),"Recently, I stumbled upon what I believe to be a new representation of $\zeta(\sigma+i t)^b$ by chance, and thus have no proof of it, and I am wondering if it is possible to prove. Let $\eta (s) = \zeta (s) (1-2^{1-s})$ denote the Dirichlet eta function, where $\zeta$ is the Riemann zeta function and $s = \sigma + i t$ . Motivation: To motivative the potential usefulness of this representation, notice that $\zeta$ is transformed from taking a complex argument, to a real argument, allowing safer manipulations with it, as log singularities are no longer as major of an issue. I've had Mathematica numerically verify the conjecture on a few hundred combinations of $\sigma, t$ , and $b$ , each time producing the correct values- as far as I can tell, it even seems to behave appropriately near $\zeta$ zeros, from approaching the first few zeros, above and below the real line, from all directions. $\forall \sigma, t, b \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ : $$\eta (s)^b-1=\frac{2}{\pi}\int_{0}^{\infty}\int_{0}^{\infty}\cos(\sqrt{t}x e^{i \pi/4})\cos(x y)\left(\eta(\sigma+y^2)^b-1\right)\,dy\,dx$$ Is it possible to prove/disprove this representation? A suggestion by @DinosaurEgg was the fact that a Fourier inversion formula indicates: $$f(t) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \cos \left(y\left(x-t\right)\right) f(x) \, dx \, dy$$ which for even functions can be written as $$f(t) = \frac{2}{\pi} \int_{0}^{\infty}\int_{0}^{\infty} \cos \left( x y \right) \cos \left( y t\right) f(x) \, dx \, dy$$ However, to my knowledge, Fourier inversion only generally holds for functions $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{C}$ so perhaps the Paley-Wiener theorem is at play here to allow my $\eta$ representation to hold, however, I’m not sure how to apply it here.","Recently, I stumbled upon what I believe to be a new representation of by chance, and thus have no proof of it, and I am wondering if it is possible to prove.

47,Reinventing The Wheel - Part 2: The Lebesgue Integral,Reinventing The Wheel - Part 2: The Lebesgue Integral,,"Disclaimer After struggling for some time to find an appropriate definition for the notion of integration I came across another attempt for which I would need your help deciding to what extend this can or cannot be reasonable. Context The Lebesgue integral as most of you know can be interpreted as some sort of absolute integrability. Very much the same holds true for the Bochner integral that - being equivalent to the Lebesgue integral - makes this fact even more light up. While studying the concept of summation I noticed similarities of this technique within infinite sums. That is in order to handle infinite sums and their conditional convergence one introduces a Banach space structure. Then by absolute convergence or similar square summability these can be controlled so to guarantee unconditional convergence. However, taking a closer look on the concept of summation itself one understands that these problems merely arise as a missuse of sums by series giving all sort of problems of conditional convergence. So I started wondering is the analogues problem happening within the Lebesgue integral... Starting from sums one might guess that nets can handle the problem (of course one has to be very careful as measures are considered as 'only' countably additive). Now the big problem stands in the middle: If an appropriate concept can give a satisfactory notion of integral what will be the ordering giving nets then? A first try will give the Riemann integral. Passing from halfopen partitions to measurable partitions pathological examples like the Dirichlet function are managed while keeping continuous functions over compact sets integrable. However unbounded functions like the reciprocal squareroot stay untouched. So one has to work harder. Thinking about the problems one understands that there is two conceptual problems, unboundedness of domain and unboundedness of range. The first one can be handled rather easily by first allowing naturally only finite measure spaces as for example in the case of complex measures and then extending by improper integrals by the use of the net of all finite subspaces (not only some sequence). This immediately rules out the possibility to salvage the reciprocal squareroot as an improper integral as other unbounded functions. Now, any way of introducing an ordering on tagged partitions of the domain fails to handle general unbounded functions (a control of unbounded functions taking values in a topological vector space becomes even harder). Another attempt is to introduce a gauge. Though being very very powerful over compact intervals they heavily rely on the compactness of the interval and moreover on the measure space being Borel. So one has hard chance to generalize the gauge integral for example to the situation faced in the spectral theorem. The very much the same problem arises for any kind of gauge integral... So one must find another way to attack unboundedness of the range. A guess then is to of course as Lebesgue already did so somehow partition the range - this time however conceptually similar to the case of summability as described above. Once more said: The idea is to find a concept similar to summability without absolute convergence! Attempt Here comes the second attempt... Let $\Omega$ be a finite measure space and $V$ a topological vector space and $f:\Omega\to V$. Call a triple $\rho:=(S,U;A_s)$ a resolution w.r.t. $f$ with: $S$ a finite subset of $V$, $U$ an open neighborhood of zero and $A_s$ disjoint measurable sets of $\Omega$ if: $A_s\subseteq f^{-1}(U+s)$ $\bigcup_{s\in S}A_s=f^{-1}(U+S)$ (This should not be interpreted as a gauge but rather as a partition.) Introduce an ordering $\rho\leq\rho'$ on the resolutions by: $S\subseteq S'$ $U\supseteq U'$ $f^{-1}(U+S)\subseteq f^{-1}(U'+S')$ (The ordering is directed.) Construct the net of sums by: $$I(f;\rho):=\sum_{s\in S}\mu(A_s)s$$ (The neighborhood $U$ takes the role of relating measures to vectors.) Define $f$ to be integrable with integral $I(f)$ if: $$I(f;\rho)\to I(f)$$ (The integral being unique provided $V$ being Hausdorff.) Now these definitions seem horribly complicated but they follow a few simple ideas: The central idea here is to focus on vectors as the major object within the sums also since the integral itself is one, so start with a finite sum of vectors $s\in S$ The problem now is to relate vectors to sets, this is basically done by the neighborhood of zero $U$. Having a topological vector space makes $U+s$ a neighborhood of $s$. The integral of a function should involve the function itself of course, that is the preimage of the function under consideration relates the neighborhoods $U+s$ to measurable subsets $A_s$. The requirement that $U$ be better open becomes evident here. Finally these measurable sets weight the individual summands by their mass $\mu(A_s)$ and closes the circle vector-set-set-number-vector. Here again having a vector space makes it evident to allow/restrict to complex measures rather than positive ones (for nonfinite measure spaces see doscussion in the context) The rest is technicalities... Moreover, these can be interpreted as an approximation by simple functions. The nice thing in here is that it automatically sorts out bad steps like blocks escaping to infinity or towers blowing up as peaks...

Again, we set $q=e^{-\pi x}$ and $$\theta_2 \equiv \theta_2(q)= \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} q^{(n+\frac12)^2}\\\theta_3\equiv \theta_3(q)=\sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} q^{n^2}\\\theta_4\equiv \theta_4(q)=\sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}}(-1)^n q^{n^2}$$ We also have the relations $$ \theta_2^4+\theta_4^4=\theta_3^4 \\ \theta_2(e^{-\pi/x})=\frac1{\sqrt{x}}\theta_4(e^{-\pi x}) \\ \theta_3(e^{-\pi/x})=\frac1{\sqrt{x}}\theta_3(e^{-\pi x})\tag{9} $$ I will omit all the intermediate steps and just state what I've found so far, and also some other related identities which I've not proven, but match numerically. So, using Singh's formulas (changing $q$ to $-q$ and rewriting in terms of hyperbolic functions), I get that $$\int_0^{\infty} \frac{\theta_4^{10}}{1+x^2}dx=\frac{768 \beta(4)}{5 \pi^4}-\frac{32}{75}-2\int_0^{\infty} \frac{\theta_2^4\theta_4^6}{1+x^2}dx\tag{10}$$ $$\int_0^{\infty} \frac{\theta_4^{12}}{1+x^2}dx=\frac{450 \zeta(5)}{\pi^5}-\int_0^{\infty} \frac{\theta_2^4\theta_3^4\theta_4^4}{1+x^2}dx\tag{11}$$ Notice that $(10)$ and $(11)$ are a bit different from the expressions I wrote in the comments on Singh's answer. Numerical evidence suggests that: $$\int_0^{\infty} \frac{\theta_2^4\theta_3^4\theta_4^4}{1+x^2}dx=\frac23\int_0^{\infty} \theta_2^4\theta_3^4\theta_4^4 dx\tag{12}$$ $$\int_0^{\infty} \frac{\theta_2^4\theta_3^4\theta_4^2}{1+x^2}dx=\frac83\int_0^{\infty} \theta_2^2\theta_3^4\theta_4^4 dx\tag{13}$$ $$\int_0^{\infty} \theta_2^4\theta_4^2dx=\int_0^{\infty} \theta_2^2\theta_4^2dx=1\tag{14}$$ $$\int_0^{\infty} \frac{\theta_2^4\theta_4^4}{1+x^2}dx=\frac{8\zeta(3)}{\pi^3}\tag{15}$$ $$\int_0^{\infty} \frac{\theta_2^4\theta_4^2}{1+x^2}dx=\frac23\tag{16}$$ All of these just make me more confident that an ultimate closed form for both $(10)$ , $(11)$ and higher power combinations of theta functions exist. As a side note, these integrals identities can be translated into identities about lattice sums, by expanding the theta functions into their series definition.","The Jacobi theta function is defined by For this question, set and .

These identities check out to a lot of digits, according to Mathematica . As I mentioned, in order to drive these identities I used Lambert series representations for powers of which I have found online.

When n->infinity then A002485(n)/A002486(n)->Pi while the integral will approach value of 0. So the way to strengthen or to disproof my conjecture is to see wether there exists set of i, j, k and l under which integral, and consequently, the resulting expression consisting of  hypergeometric and gamma functions attains the value of zero (0). It is shown in examples below that the formula under question is applicable for some first few convergents (of the $\mathrm{A002485}(n)/\mathrm{A002486}(n)$ type). For example, for $\frac{22}{7}$ $$\frac{22}{7} - \pi = \int_{0}^{1}\frac{x^4(1-x)^4}{1+x^2}\,\mathrm{d}x$$ with $n=3, i=-1, j=0, k=1, l=4$ - with regards to my above suggested generalization.

It also works for found by Lucas formula for $\frac{333}{106}$ $$\pi - \frac{333}{106} = \frac{1}{530}\int_{0}^{1}\frac{x^5(1-x)^6(197+462x^2)}{1+x^2}\,\mathrm{d}x$$ with $n=4, i=265, j=1, k=197, l=5$ - with regards to my above suggested generalization.

And it works for Lucas's formula for $\frac{355}{113}$ $$\frac{355}{113} - \pi = \frac{1}{3164}\int_{0}^{1}\frac{x^8(1-x)^8(25+816x^2)}{(1+x^2)}\mathrm dx$$ with $n=5, i=791, j=2, k=25, l=8$ - with regards to my above suggested generalization.

This question relates to my answer given in Is there an integral that proves $\pi > 333/106$? Update#1: Recently Thomas Baruchel (see his answer below) has conducted extensive calculations and found that four parameters formula yields infinite number of solutions for each $n$ . Thomas shared with me his calculations results and supplied me with quite a few of valid combinations of $i, j, k, l$ values - so now I have a lot of experimentally found five-tuples $\{ n,i, j, k, l\}$ , which satisfy above parametrization, where $n$ varies in the range from 2 to 26. Looking at all available {i,j,k,l} solutions (initial ones found by me and those which were found by Thomas Baruchel program) one could observe that in all of them abs(l-j)=2*m where ""m"" is some positive integer. Based on this data, of course, it would be nice to find how (if at all) $i, j, k, l$ are inter-related between each other and with "" $n$ "" - but such inter-relation (if exists) is not obvious and difficult to derive just by observation ... (though it is clearly seen that an absolute value of "" $i$ "" is strongly increasing as "" $n$ "" is growing from 2 to 26). Update #2: Thanks to Jaume Oliver Lafont, at least one case, answering affirmatively to the last question, is identified: i=-1, j=-2, k=1, l=0 $$\pi = \int_{0}^{1}\frac{4}{1+x^2}\,\mathrm{d}x$$ Should there be an infinite number of such cases?

With $y \in \mathbb{N}$, define: $$A(y) = \int_0^{\infty} \eta( i x)\,\eta(i x y)\,dx.$$ The integral can be rewritten in the following infinite series forms: \begin{align} A(y) & = \frac{12}{\pi} \sum_{(n,m) \in \mathbb{Z}^2} \frac{(-1)^{n+m}}{(6n+1)^2+y \, (6m+1)^2} \\[8pt] & =\frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{y}} \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} \frac{(-1)^n}{6n+1} \, \dfrac{ \sinh \frac{\pi \sqrt{y}}{3} (6n+1)}{\cosh \frac{\pi \sqrt{y}}{2} (6n+1)} \\[8pt] & = \frac{2}{\sqrt{y}} \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} (-1)^n \tanh^{-1} \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \operatorname{sech}(\pi \sqrt{y} (n+1/6))\right). \end{align} Numerical computations seem to confirm that \begin{align} A(1) & = \ln\left(1+ \sqrt{3} +\sqrt{3+2 \sqrt{3}} \right) \tag{1} \\[8pt] A(2) & = \frac1{\sqrt{2}} \ln \left(1+ \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{2+ 2 \sqrt{2}} \right) \tag{2} \\[8pt] A(3) & = \frac1{\sqrt{3}} \ln \left( 1+ 2^{1/3} + 2^{2/3} \right) \tag{3} \end{align} And generally, it looks like $$A(y) = \frac1{\sqrt{y}} \,\ln u \tag{4}$$ where $u$ is the root closest to $1$ from above, of a polynomial $P_y$.  I've checked dozens of different $y$'s and made a list of those polynomials - check this pastebin link. Some are missing, e.g. I could not find $P_6$. Others seem to follow patterns of their own, for example the Heegner numbers. Here's the polynomial for $y=163$: $$\small P_{163}(u) = u^{12} + 640314 u^{10} + 1280624 u^9 + 640287 u^8 - 1280736 u^7 - 2561412 u^6 - 1280736 u^5 + 640287 u^4 + 1280624 u^3 + 640314 u^2 + 1 = 0$$ Other interesting things to look at are the behaviour of $P_y(1)$ and $P_y(-1)$, with regard to $y \pmod{24}$, and approximations to $\pi$ which follow from terminating the infinite series at its first term. However, I have got no clue how to prove it. What would be a way to prove $(4)$? What can be said about the polynomials $P_y$?   Also, can you help me find $P_6$, or other missing polynomials from my list? Edit. Finally, I was able to produce a closed form for this integral thanks to @DaveHuff's hints. The idea is to rewrite the infinite series as  $$A(y) = \frac2{\sqrt{y}} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \tanh^{-1}\left( \dfrac{\cos \frac{\pi}{6} (2n+1)}{\cosh \frac{\pi \sqrt{y}}{6} (2n+1)}\right),$$ and then, using $\displaystyle \,\,\,\tanh^{-1}x = \frac12 \ln \left( \frac{1+x}{1-x} \right),$ proceed to factorize the summand and obtain  $$\sqrt{y} \,A(y) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \ln \left( \dfrac{(1-e^{5 \pi i n/6-\pi n\sqrt{y}/6})(1-e^{-5 \pi i n/6-\pi n\sqrt{y}/6})}{(1-e^{ \pi i n/6-\pi n\sqrt{y}/6})(1-e^{-\pi i n/6-\pi n\sqrt{y}/6})} \right),$$ which means:  $$A(y) = \frac1{\sqrt{y}} \,\ln \left( \dfrac{\eta\left(\frac{i \sqrt{y}+5}{12}\right)\eta\left(\frac{i \sqrt{y}-5}{12}\right)}{\eta\left(\frac{i \sqrt{y}+1}{12}\right)\eta\left(\frac{i \sqrt{y}-1}{12}\right)}\right).$$ I still don't know enough eta quotient theory, so I don't know how to show that this eta quotient is in fact algebraic for every natural $y$ (let alone bring it to the implicit form in @TitoPiezasIII 's answer), but this is still good progress.","While experimenting with integrals involving the Dedekind Eta function, I came across a family of integrals which seem to follow  a very simple pattern. With $y \in \mathbb{N}$, define: $$A(y) = \int_0^{\infty} \eta( i x)\,\eta(i x y)\,dx.$$ The integral can be rewritten in the following infinite series forms: \begin{align} A(y) & = \frac{12}{\pi} \sum_{(n,m) \in \mathbb{Z}^2} \frac{(-1)^{n+m}}{(6n+1)^2+y \, (6m+1)^2} \\[8pt] & =\frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{y}} \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} \frac{(-1)^n}{6n+1} \, \dfrac{ \sinh \frac{\pi \sqrt{y}}{3} (6n+1)}{\cosh \frac{\pi \sqrt{y}}{2} (6n+1)} \\[8pt] & = \frac{2}{\sqrt{y}} \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} (-1)^n \tanh^{-1} \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \operatorname{sech}(\pi \sqrt{y} (n+1/6))\right). \end{align} Numerical computations seem to confirm that \begin{align} A(1) & = \ln\left(1+ \sqrt{3} +\sqrt{3+2 \sqrt{3}} \right) \tag{1} \\[8pt] A(2) & = \frac1{\sqrt{2}} \ln \left(1+ \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{2+ 2 \sqrt{2}} \right) \tag{2} \\[8pt] A(3) & = \frac1{\sqrt{3}} \ln \left( 1+ 2^{1/3} + 2^{2/3} \right) \tag{3} \end{align} And generally, it looks like $$A(y) = \frac1{\sqrt{y}} \,\ln u \tag{4}$$ where $u$ is the root closest to $1$ from above, of a polynomial $P_y$.  I've checked dozens of different $y$'s and made a list of those polynomials - check this pastebin link. Some are missing, e.g. I could not find $P_6$. Others seem to follow patterns of their own, for example the Heegner numbers. Here's the polynomial for $y=163$: $$\small P_{163}(u) = u^{12} + 640314 u^{10} + 1280624 u^9 + 640287 u^8 - 1280736 u^7 - 2561412 u^6 - 1280736 u^5 + 640287 u^4 + 1280624 u^3 + 640314 u^2 + 1 = 0$$ Other interesting things to look at are the behaviour of $P_y(1)$ and $P_y(-1)$, with regard to $y \pmod{24}$, and approximations to $\pi$ which follow from terminating the infinite series at its first term. However, I have got no clue how to prove it. What would be a way to prove $(4)$? What can be said about the polynomials $P_y$?   Also, can you help me find $P_6$, or other missing polynomials from my list? Edit. Finally, I was able to produce a closed form for this integral thanks to @DaveHuff's hints.

It contains the function $g \equiv t \mapsto \left(t-\frac{1}{2}\right)^{-1}$ , for which we have $S(g) = \pi^2$ , while $D(g)$ does not exist. Therefore, I would like to find the set $$B = \{f \in A : D(f) \text{ exists and } D(f) = S(f)\} \subsetneq A$$ on which the above equation holds.

(No! See edit.) What is the largest subset of $B$ (maybe even $B$ itself?) we can find? Some examples ( $\mathrm{G}$ is Catalan's constant): \begin{align} D(\arctan) \stackrel{\text{Hölder cont.}}{=} S(\arctan) &= 2 \mathrm{G} - \frac{\pi^2}{16} - \frac{\pi}{4}\log(2) + \frac{1}{4} \log^2(2) \\ D(\log^3) \stackrel{\text{monotone}}{=} S(\log^3) &= 2 \pi^2 + \frac{2\pi^4}{15} + 12 \zeta(3)\\ D\left(t \mapsto \frac{\log(1-t)}{t^{3/2}}\right) \stackrel{?}{=} S\left(t \mapsto \frac{\log(1-t)}{t^{3/2}}\right) &= \frac{2\pi^2}{3} - 16 \log(2) (1 - \log(2)) \end{align} The last function is neither Hölder continuous nor monotone, so it is unclear whether the integrals are equal.

UPDATE: I've managed to show that $$\lim_{a\to\infty }\frac{aI(a)}{\ln(a)}=1$$","I'm investigating integrals in the form $$I(a):=\int_0^\infty \frac{dx}{e^x+ax}$$ So far, I haven't been able to find any special values other than $I(0)=1$, and I've only managed to evaluate these similar indefinite integrals: $$\int \frac{x-1}{e^x+ax}dx=-\frac{\ln(1+axe^{-x})}{a}+C$$ $$\int \frac{xdx}{e^x+x+1}=-\ln(1+e^{-x}(x+1))+C$$ I've also found the following series representation for $I(a)$: $$I(a)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-a)^n n!}{(n+1)^{n+1}}$$ ...which looks remarkably similar to the Maclaurin series for the Lambert-W function.
