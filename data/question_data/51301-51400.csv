1,Does the inverse Laplace transform of $F(s)=\frac{\sin(\xi\sqrt{s})}{\sqrt{s}}$ exist for some $\xi\in\mathbb{C}$?,Does the inverse Laplace transform of  exist for some ?,F(s)=\frac{\sin(\xi\sqrt{s})}{\sqrt{s}} \xi\in\mathbb{C},"In particular, I am interested in $\xi = z\sqrt{i}$ , with $z>0$ . To begin with, formal considerations, such as $$\begin{align*}\mathcal{L}^{-1}\!\left[F(s)\right]=\frac{1}{2i}\,\mathcal{L}^{-1}\!\left[\frac{e^{i\xi\sqrt{s}}}{\sqrt{s}}\right]-\frac{1}{2i}\,\mathcal{L}^{-1}\!\left[\frac{e^{-i\xi\sqrt{s}}}{\sqrt{s}}\right]=\frac{e^{\frac{1}{4t}(-i\xi)^2}}{2i\,\sqrt{\pi t}}-\frac{e^{\frac{1}{4t}(i\xi)^2}}{2i\,\sqrt{\pi t}}=0,\end{align*}$$ and similar ones all seem to imply $\mathcal{L}^{-1}[F(s)]=0$ . More rigorously, invoking the Bromwich inversion formula $$\mathcal{L}^{-1}\!\left[F(s)\right] = \int_{\alpha-i\infty}^{\alpha+i\infty}F(s)\,e^{st}ds,$$ and applying Cauchy's integral theorem to the closed contour depicted below, I obtain $$\mathcal{L}^{-1}\!\left[F(s)\right] = \lim_{T\to\infty} I_{AB} = - \lim_{\epsilon\to0^+}\big(I_{EH}+I_{KL}\big).$$ The branch cut of $\sqrt{s}$ is taken along the negative real axis. Note as well that the integrals arising from the arcs vanish in the limit $R\to\infty$ by Jordan's Lemma (i.e., considering only $\xi=z\sqrt{i}$ , $z>0$ ). However, $$\begin{align*}I_{EH}+I_{KL}&=\int_{-\infty}^0\frac{\sin\big[z\sqrt{i}\,\sqrt{x+i\epsilon}\big]}{\sqrt{x+i\epsilon}}\,e^{xt}+\int_0^{-\infty}\frac{\sin\big[z\sqrt{i}\,\sqrt{x-i\epsilon}\big]}{\sqrt{x-i\epsilon}}\,e^{xt}\\[5pt]&=\int_0^{\infty}\frac{\sin\big[z\sqrt{i}\,\sqrt{i\epsilon-u}\big]}{\sqrt{i\epsilon-u}}\,e^{-ut}-\int_0^{\infty}\frac{\sin\big[z\sqrt{i}\,\sqrt{-u-i\epsilon}\big]}{\sqrt{-u-i\epsilon}}\,e^{-ut}\end{align*},$$ letting $u=-x$ in each integral above.

It can be used to show that the entropy of an ideal Fermi gas is always non-negative. Here's what I have come up with so far: Since $f_s (1) = \eta (s) > 0$ for $s \geq 0$ ( $\eta$ is the Dirichlet eta function), $(1)$ trivially holds for $x = 1$ . Note that we have $x f_{s+1}'(x) = f_s (x)$ for $s \geq 0$ and $x > 0$ by definition. Now suppose that $(1)$ is true for some $s \geq 0$ . Then $$ \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x} [(s+2)f_{s+2}(x) - \log(x) f_{s+1}(x)] = \frac{1}{x} [(s+1)f_{s+1}(x) - \log(x) f_{s}(x)] > 0$$ follows for $x \geq 1$ and integration yields $(1)$ with $s$ replaced by $s+1$ . Therefore, it is sufficient to prove the inequality for $s \in [0,1)$ . The case $s=0$ is trivial, as $f_0 (x) = \frac{x}{1+x}$ and $f_1(x) = \log(1+x)$ . Now let $s \in (0,1)$ . The inequality $f_{s+1}(x) > f_{s}(x) , \, x > 0 ,$ confirms $(1)$ for $x \in [1,\mathrm{e}^{s+1}]$ . The asymptotic expansion $$ f_{s} (x) \stackrel{x \to \infty}{\sim} 2 \log^s (x) \sum \limits_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\eta(2k)}{\Gamma(s+1-2k) \log^{2k}(x)} $$ leads to $$ \frac{(s+1) f_{s+1}(x)}{\log(x) f_s(x)} \stackrel{x \to \infty}{\sim} 1 + \frac{\pi^2 s}{3 \log^2 (x)} + \mathcal{O}(\log^{-4}(x)) \, , $$ which shows that $(1)$ holds for sufficiently large $x$ . These results and numerical experiments clearly suggest that the inequality is true for all $x \geq 1$ , but I have not found a proof yet. Integration by parts reveals that $(1)$ is equivalent to $$ \tag{2} \int \limits_0^\infty \frac{u^{s+1} \mathrm{e}^{\alpha (u-1)}}{(\mathrm{e}^{\alpha (u-1)} + 1)^2} \, \mathrm{d} u > \int \limits_0^\infty \frac{u^s \mathrm{e}^{\alpha (u-1)}}{(\mathrm{e}^{\alpha (u-1)} + 1)^2} \, \mathrm{d} u \, , \, \alpha = \log(x),$$ but I am stuck here as well, so my question is: How can we prove $(1)$ or $(2)$ for $s \in (0,1)$ and $x > 1$ ?","For and define I would like to prove the inequality for and (it is obviously correct for ).

For example we have the following: \begin{eqnarray} {\mathcal I}^{(1,2)}_1&=&\frac{1}{2} \text{Li}_3(t) \log ^2\left(\frac{\xi }{t}\right)+2 \text{Li}_4(t) \log \left(\frac{\xi }{t}\right)-\text{Li}_4(\xi ) \log \left(\frac{t}{\xi }\right)+3 \text{Li}_5(t)-3 \text{Li}_5(\xi )\\ {\mathcal I}^{(1,3)}_2&=&  -\frac{1}{6} \text{Li}_4(t) \log ^3\left(\frac{\xi }{t}\right)-\text{Li}_5(t) \log ^2\left(\frac{\xi }{t}\right)-3 \text{Li}_6(t) \log \left(\frac{\xi }{t}\right)+\text{Li}_6(\xi ) \log \left(\frac{t}{\xi    }\right)-4 \text{Li}_7(t)+4 \text{Li}_7(\xi )\\ {\mathcal I}^{(1,4)}_3 &=& \frac{1}{24} \text{Li}_5(t) \log ^4\left(\frac{\xi }{t}\right)+\frac{1}{3} \text{Li}_6(t) \log ^3\left(\frac{\xi }{t}\right)+\frac{3}{2} \text{Li}_7(t) \log ^2\left(\frac{\xi }{t}\right)+4 \text{Li}_8(t) \log    \left(\frac{\xi }{t}\right)-\text{Li}_8(\xi ) \log \left(\frac{t}{\xi }\right)+5 \text{Li}_9(t)-5 \text{Li}_9(\xi ) \end{eqnarray} Now, my question is can we actually find a closed form expression for the quantities in question or otherwise do we always have to resort to CAS to solve the equations in question?",,"['integration', 'polylogarithm']"

Furthermore, this is just the start of a bunch of complicated calculations I'll have to perform, and so breaking it up into some manageable chunks of some form would be very helpful.  I'm mainly interested in the ""small"" and ""large"" regimes, as well as where the function ""changes"" the overall power law. For example, in the following Log-Log plot, you see there is a ""knee"" around the region of ""5"" to ""10"", at different points for different parameters of the problem. Questions: 1) Does anyone have any ideas on how to break this up into a more manageable function say, using a Taylor Series? An earlier study showed that it sort of went as $$\sim \frac{1}{1 + c_1 k^2 + c_2 k^5}$$ but in that case the integral was enormously simpler (it still needed to be approximated by manipulating $c_1$ and $c_2$ though) and there were no parameters like $a$ and $b$ involved. I can get rid of one of the parameters by rescaling the variable but I'm still left with another. I can then do a Taylor series approximation around $0$ to get the leading order terms, and another around $\infty$ to get the asymptotic dependence. However, in the intermediate region I'm basically working in the dark. 2) Can the Taylor series around some pivotal point could help me in approximating the function in this region. I can easily perform such a series, but it gives me results in powers of $(k-k_0)$, which work locally, but not globally (i.e. I couldn't just ""attach"" it to the other initial and asymptotic values. 3) Furthermore, if I ""knew"" there should be (say) a $k^{-1}$ behaviour around a certain point (say $k_0$), would I be able to verify this using a Taylor series?

That is $\phi$ is an injective and continuous mapping satisfying $$ d(x,y) = \| \phi(x)-\phi(y)\|^2 \quad \quad \forall x,y\in X. $$  Then the author uses the following integral without further explanation $$ \int_X \phi(x)  \,d\mu (x), $$ where $\mu$ is a finite signed Borel measure on $(X,\mathcal{B}(X))$ satisfying $$ \int_X d(x,o)  \,d|\mu|(x)< \infty. $$ for some $o\in X$.

I'm reading the article Distance covariance in metric spaces . The author considers (p. 9-11) an isometric embedding $\phi:(X,d^{1/2})\to H$, where $(X,d)$ is a metric space and $H$ is a Hilbert space. That is $\phi$ is an injective and continuous mapping satisfying $$ d(x,y) = \| \phi(x)-\phi(y)\|^2 \quad \quad \forall x,y\in X. $$  Then the author uses the following integral without further explanation $$ \int_X \phi(x)  \,d\mu (x), $$ where $\mu$ is a finite signed Borel measure on $(X,\mathcal{B}(X))$ satisfying $$ \int_X d(x,o)  \,d|\mu|(x)< \infty. $$ for some $o\in X$.

Maybe I'm missing some clever change of variables or nice contour for residue calculation. This integral arises when performing the Fourier transform of a superellipsoid . EDIT I decided to add a short connotation to this question. The original problem comes from physics and requires making a Fourier transform of a superellipsoid. I parametrized superellipsoid in the following manner: $$x=a*r*\cos^\eta\theta*\cos^\epsilon\phi,$$ $$y=b*r*\cos^\eta\theta*\sin^\epsilon\phi,$$ $$z=c*r*\sin^\eta\theta$$ Here $\sin^{\epsilon}\theta$ and $\cos^{\eta}\theta$ are signed functions i.e. $\sin^{\epsilon}\theta = sign(\sin\theta)*|\sin^{\epsilon}\theta|$. The absolute value of the determinant of the Jacobian is $abc\epsilon\eta r^2\cos^{2\epsilon-1}\theta\sin^{\epsilon -1}\theta\cos^{\eta-1}\phi\sin^{\eta-1}\phi$. Next, when performing Fourier transform direct vector k along z axis.

Change of variable $t=\sin^\epsilon\theta$ brings the integral to the form (some constant coefficients are omitted): $$\int_{r=0}^1\int_{t=0}^{1}  (1-t^{2 \over \epsilon})^{\epsilon -1} e^{-ikrt}dt dr$$ My main concern is the integration of the expression above with respect to t. I wasn't able to evaluate this integral by parts/change of variable or using calculus of residues. Expanding $e^{-ikrt}=\sum_{n=0}^\infty (-ikrt)^n/n!$, then we have the integral of the type $$\int_{t=0}^{1} t^n(1-t^{2/\epsilon})^{\epsilon-1}dt$$ Integrating the expression above we get:$$\epsilon\Gamma(\epsilon)*\Gamma({\epsilon\over 2}\left(n+1)\right)\over2\Gamma\left({\epsilon\over 2}(n+3))\right)$$    and $$\int_{t=0}^{1} (1-t^{2 \over \epsilon})^{\epsilon -1} e^{-ikrt}dt =\sum_{n=0}^\infty{\epsilon\Gamma(\epsilon) \Gamma\left((n+1){\epsilon\over 2}\right)\over 2\Gamma(\left(n+3){\epsilon\over 2}\right)}{(-ikr)^n\over n!}$$ The last summation looks similar to the series expansion of hypergeometric function except it has $\epsilon/2$ in the argument of the gamma function and it seems that $\Gamma(kx)$ does not equal anything nice in terms of $\Gamma(x)$. Maybe I'm missing some clever change of variables or nice contour for residue calculation. This integral arises when performing the Fourier transform of a superellipsoid . EDIT I decided to add a short connotation to this question. The original problem comes from physics and requires making a Fourier transform of a superellipsoid. I parametrized superellipsoid in the following manner: $$x=a*r*\cos^\eta\theta*\cos^\epsilon\phi,$$ $$y=b*r*\cos^\eta\theta*\sin^\epsilon\phi,$$ $$z=c*r*\sin^\eta\theta$$ Here $\sin^{\epsilon}\theta$ and $\cos^{\eta}\theta$ are signed functions i.e. $\sin^{\epsilon}\theta = sign(\sin\theta)*|\sin^{\epsilon}\theta|$. The absolute value of the determinant of the Jacobian is $abc\epsilon\eta r^2\cos^{2\epsilon-1}\theta\sin^{\epsilon -1}\theta\cos^{\eta-1}\phi\sin^{\eta-1}\phi$. Next, when performing Fourier transform direct vector k along z axis. Then we have in the region $\theta[0,\pi/2]$, $\phi[0,\pi/2]$: $$abc\epsilon\eta\int_{r=0}^1 \int_{\theta=0}^{\theta = \pi/2}\int_{\phi=0}^{\pi/2}e^{-ikr\sin^{\epsilon}}r^2\cos^{2\epsilon-1}\theta\sin^{\epsilon-1}\theta\cos^{\eta-1}\phi\sin^{\eta-1}\phi dr d\theta d\phi$$ Integration with respect to $\phi$ gives ${1 \over 2^{\eta - 1}}_2F_1({1 \over 2}, {2 - \eta \over 2};{3 \over 2};1)$ and we left with the integral of the form like in the very beginning of this question.
