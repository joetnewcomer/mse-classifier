0,Codomain of a function,Codomain of a function,,"At high school we were told that a function has a domain and a range, the function maps from the domain to the range.

17,"Function ""evaluation"" just means ""composition""?","Function ""evaluation"" just means ""composition""?",,"I am self-studying and have a basic or naive question that follows from a simple observation. I have also included tags for type theory, etc because ""evaluation"" probably has a different meaning in these constructive approaches, which I'm also curious about. Any set $X$ with elements $x_i$ can be characterized by a set denoted $(X)$ of pairs $(\star, x_i)$ , alternatively denoted $(\star \mapsto x_i)$ (for all $x_i \in X$ ). Each one of these latter pairs encodes a distinct function from common domain $\{ \star \}$ to (each different element of) $X$ . If we name such functions after their image, i.e. $(x_i):\star \mapsto x_i$ , then the symbol "" $f(x_i)$ "", traditionally interpreted as function evaluation , is reinterpreted as function composition , i.e. $f\circ (x_i)$ and the $\circ$ is often notationally suppressed. And roughly, $f = \cup_xf(x)$ , every function decomposes to a unique set of singleton functions (better word?). Question: Is there anything more to evaluation, or can I exactly equate evaluation with composition and forever de-clutter my mind of the term ""evaluation""? Is the above perspective unusual or fruitful beyond reducing terminological clutter? The notion of evaluation above - perhaps ""extensional"" is the right term? - means essentially subsetting the function at the chosen argument $x$ . Perhaps I will see that a full answer to my question requires considering an intentional (?) or constructive perspective on ""evaluation"" (as in lambda calculus, etc). Perhaps only there will composition and evaluation legitimately have distinct meanings. Edit: The notation $(x)$ seemed the most natural way to denote any function with singleton domain because it coheres with the conventional way to write evaluation as $f(x)$ . The notation seems unambiguous because there is no context I can think of, other than ""evaluation"", where a single symbol, say $x$ , is enclosed in brackets ""()""? It does seem useful to notationally distinguish functions on singleton domain in some way: I would like the notation to be a mnemonic for whether the resulting function composite is a singleton function (i.e. a ""value"" like $f(x_i) = f \circ (x_i) = (\star, y_j)$ ) versus a non-singleton function. Perhaps there is a conventional notation for functions from singleton domain, other than $(x)$ and a conventional name for such functions, other than ""singleton functions""?","I am self-studying and have a basic or naive question that follows from a simple observation.

Each one of these latter pairs encodes a distinct function from common domain to (each different element of) . If we name such functions after their image, i.e. , then the symbol "" "", traditionally interpreted as function evaluation , is reinterpreted as function composition , i.e. and the is often notationally suppressed. And roughly, , every function decomposes to a unique set of singleton functions (better word?). Question: Is there anything more to evaluation, or can I exactly equate evaluation with composition and forever de-clutter my mind of the term ""evaluation""? Is the above perspective unusual or fruitful beyond reducing terminological clutter? The notion of evaluation above - perhaps ""extensional"" is the right term? - means essentially subsetting the function at the chosen argument . Perhaps I will see that a full answer to my question requires considering an intentional (?) or constructive perspective on ""evaluation"" (as in lambda calculus, etc). Perhaps only there will composition and evaluation legitimately have distinct meanings. Edit: The notation seemed the most natural way to denote any function with singleton domain because it coheres with the conventional way to write evaluation as . The notation seems unambiguous because there is no context I can think of, other than ""evaluation"", where a single symbol, say , is enclosed in brackets ""()""? It does seem useful to notationally distinguish functions on singleton domain in some way: I would like the notation to be a mnemonic for whether the resulting function composite is a singleton function (i.e. a ""value"" like ) versus a non-singleton function. Perhaps there is a conventional notation for functions from singleton domain, other than and a conventional name for such functions, other than ""singleton functions""?","X x_i (X) (\star, x_i) (\star \mapsto x_i) x_i \in X \{ \star \} X (x_i):\star \mapsto x_i f(x_i) f\circ (x_i) \circ f = \cup_xf(x) x (x) f(x) x f(x_i) = f \circ (x_i) = (\star, y_j) (x)","['functions', 'category-theory', 'type-theory', 'lambda-calculus']"

At the end of the proof, I found myself quite confused, and had to look carefully at the build-up to see how the conclusion followed. I get the steps, now - but not the intuition. The authors took sets $X$ and $Y$ and assumed injections $f: X \rightarrow Y$, $g: Y \rightarrow X$. Since $X \sim g[f[X]]$ and $X \supseteq g[Y] \supseteq g[f[X]]$, and $Y \sim g[Y]$, the authors went to prove the lemma that $A \sim A_1, A \supseteq B \supseteq A_1 \implies A \sim B$. For the lemma, they defined recursive sequences $\{A_n\}_{n \in \omega}, \{B_n\}_{n \in \omega}$ by $A_0 = A, A_{n+1} = f[A],$ $ B_0 = B, B_{n+1} = f[B].$ Since $A_0 \supseteq B_0 \supseteq A_1 \implies f[A_0] \supseteq f[B_0] \supseteq f[A_1]$, we get from induction that $A_{n+1} \subseteq A_n$.

Putting $$ C = \bigcup_{n=0}^\infty C_n, \text{   } D = A - C,$$ they noted that $f[C] = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty C_n$, and that $h(x): A \rightarrow f[C] \cup D$ can be defined by sending $x \in C \rightarrow f(x),$ and $x \in D \rightarrow x$.

34,Can a function be increasing *at a point*?,Can a function be increasing *at a point*?,,"From what I understand we say that a function is increasing on an interval $I$ if $$ x_1 < x_2 \quad\Rightarrow\quad f(x_1) < f(x_2). $$ for all $x_1,x_2\in I$ . I understand that some might call this strictly increasing and allow for equality when saying increasing . We know that when a function is differentiable on the interval $I$ , then if $f'(x) > 0$ on $I$ then $f$ is increasing on $I$ . But here we have to be careful because if $f(x) = x^3$ then $f$ indeed is increasing on $\mathbb{R}$ even though $f'(0) = 0$ . So we can't conclude that if $f$ is increasing, then $f'(x)$ must be positive on the interval. Also, even though $f(x) = x^2$ , then $f$ is increasing on $[0,\infty)$ even though $f'(0) = 0$ . My question is Does it make sense to talk about a function being increasing at a point? The only definition I can think of making is to say that $f$ is increasing at a point $a$ if $f'(a) > 0$ . But the problems with saying this is that then the function given by $f(x) = x^3$ is not increasing at $0$ even thought it is increasing on all of $\mathbb{R}$ . I am aware ( from here ) of the example with $$ f(x) = \begin{cases}x^2\sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) + \frac{x}{2} & \text{if }x\neq 0 \\ 0 & \text{if } x = 0\end{cases}. $$ This function is differentiable at $0$ with $f'(0) = \frac{1}{2} > 0$ . For $x\neq 0$ we have $f'(x) = 2x\sin(1/x) - \cos(1/x) + 1/2$ . And so for all $x_k = \frac{1}{2k\pi}$ we have $f'(\frac{1}{2k\pi}) = -\frac{1}{2} < 0$ . That is, there is not interval around $0$ where $f$ is increasing. And so it shouldn't really make sense to say that $f$ is increasing at $0$ . One example I can think of where it maybe should make sense to take about a function being increasing at a point is when when we take the derivative of function $s(t)$ that gives the position of a particle. The derivative is then the velocity $v(t) = s'(t)$ . And maybe this is just a language issue, but here it sounds reasonable saying that if $v(a)>0$ then the velocity is positive at time $t=a$ and so the rate of change is positive at $a$ . This is almost saying that the position is increasing at that point. Again, my question is just if it makes sense to talk about a function being increasing (or decreasing) at a point . If so, how is this defined?","From what I understand we say that a function is increasing on an interval if for all .

One example I can think of where it maybe should make sense to take about a function being increasing at a point is when when we take the derivative of function that gives the position of a particle. The derivative is then the velocity . And maybe this is just a language issue, but here it sounds reasonable saying that if then the velocity is positive at time and so the rate of change is positive at . This is almost saying that the position is increasing at that point. Again, my question is just if it makes sense to talk about a function being increasing (or decreasing) at a point . If so, how is this defined?","I

35,Is there a simple-ish function for modeling seasonal changes to day/night duration and height of the sun?,Is there a simple-ish function for modeling seasonal changes to day/night duration and height of the sun?,,"I'm a hobbyist programmer, and not much of a mathematician. I'm trying to model something like the seasonal change in day length. There are two other questions here that are very similar to mine, and I posted a bounty for one of them, but the answers are over my head, and I don't think I can adapt them to what I'm doing. I was thinking more something like a sine-ish function, and hoping for some easier math. Perhaps if I show my specific case, the answers can be narrowed and simplified. What I've been able to come up with is a function getSunHeight(x, cycleDuration, dayToNightRatio) . (It's not for Earth; I'm experimenting with different values in a simulation, so a 24-hour cycle isn't a given.) In mathematical terms, getSunHeight is calculated as follows. Let $d_{\text{cycle}}$ denote the duration of a full cycle and $r_\text{day-to-night}$ denote the ratio of day to night. Let $$d_\text{daylight} = d_\text{cycle} \times r_\text{day-to-night}$$ and $$d_\text{darkness}= d_\text{cycle} - d_\text{daylight}$$ Then the sun height is $$y(x)=\left\{ \begin{array}{lcl} \sin\left(\frac{\pi x}{d_\text{daylight}}\right) & : & 0\le x\le d_\text{daylight}\\ \sin\left(\frac{\pi\left(x-d_\text{cycle}\right)}{d_\text{darkness}}\right) & : & d_\text{daylight} < x \le d_\text{cycle} \end{array} \right.$$ So $y=\operatorname{getSunHeight}(x, 10, 0.2)$ gives me a graph like this: Is there some way to get rid of the hard angle at $x=d_\text{daylight}$ (i.e. daylightDuration )? It's not a problem if the shape of the curve changes slightly; in fact it might be better, more realistic. Also, I'm not trying for a general case where I specify the latitude. I'm looking for something that assumes I'm at a fixed latitude. Further, although I'm trying to model a change in the period, I'm not particularly attached to that approach. It was suggested that I try to vary the height of the sun and keep the period the same. After lots of experimentation on Desmos, I'm still at a loss. I've been experimenting with averaging the slopes at that discontinuity, and using that average somewhere in the equation, but I haven't been able to make any headway. News: With inspiration from the comments, I've finally realized that I need to think about the entire winter/summer cycle, not just one day/night cycle. I think I almost have it solved: Let $d_{\text{annualCycle}}$ denote the duration of a full summer/winter cycle, expressed in full day/night cycles Let $d_{\text{diurnalCycle}}$ denote the duration of a full day/night cycle Let $d_{\text{daylight}}$ denote the duration of daylight for one day/night cycle Let $d_{\text{darkness}}$ denote the duration of darkness for one day/night cycle Let $r_{\text{day-to-night}}$ denote $d_{\text{daylight}}:d_{\text{diurnalCycle}}$ at the first solstice! At the second solstice, the ratio is 1 - $r_{\text{day-to-night}}$ , and at the equinoxes, the day/night ratio is 1:1 (d'oh!) Finally, rather than thinking of the sun's height , with all that angle stuff, I'll think of the function as a kind of temperature reading. So with a function y = getTemperature(x, $d_{\text{diurnalCycle}}$ , $d_{\text{annualCycle}}$ , $r_{\text{day-to-night}}$ ) I've come up with this: Let yearFullDuration = $d_{\text{annualCycle}} \ x \ d_{\text{diurnalCycle}}$ Let $r_{\text{night-to-day}} = 1 - r_{\text{day-to-night}}$ Let $c=\left(r_{\text{night-to-day}}-r_{\text{day-to-night}}\right)\sin\left(\frac{2\pi r_{\text{night-to-day}}}{d_{\text{diurnalCycle}} r_{\text{day-to-night}}}\right)+r_{\text{night-to-day}}$ $y = \sin\left(\frac{2\pi xd_{\text{diurnalCycle}}}{\text{yearFullDuration}}\right) + \sin\left(\frac{1.3 cxr_{\text{night-to-day}}}{\text{yearFullDuration}}\right)$ It gives me a graph like the following. As you can see, the zeros don't land quite where they're supposed to. I put in a fudge factor of 1.3, which is incredibly unsatisfying, but I haven't yet figured out how to the crossings right. More News: Again, with much inspiration and help from the comments, I've figured out the easier case of just adding the seasonal sine to the diurnal sine. The thing that was eluding me--the reason for the fudge factor of 1.3--was the need to square one of the ratios in the seasonal sine: Let $d_{\text{diurnal}}$ denote the duration of one day/night cycle Let $d_{\text{annual}}$ denote the number of full diurnal cycles in one summer/winter cycle Let $d_{\text{full-year}}=d_{\text{annual}}*d_{\text{diurnal}}$ Let $r_{s}$ denote the ratio of daylight duration to $d_{diurnal}$ at the summer (first) solstice Let $f_{a}=\sin\left(\frac{2xr_{s}^{2}}{d_{\text{full-year}}}\right)$ -- the annual curve Let $f_{d}=\sin\left(\frac{2\pi xd_{\text{diurnal}}}{d_{\text{full-year}}}\right)$ -- the diurnal curve And finally $y=\frac{1}2\sin\left(f_{a}+f_{d}\right)$ The graph comes out looking like one might expect if one were more math-oriented. I'm still very curious to see whether there's a way to smoothly vary the daylight/darkness ratio as the seasons progress (my original idea, extended over the course of a year rather than just one day).

For that differentiate twice and  with a general form we have : $$v''(x)u(x)\leq 0$$ $$v'(x)u'(x)\leq 0$$ $$v(x)u''(x)\leq 0$$ So the derivative is decreasing on this interval $I$ and $r'(e^{-1})>0$ We deduce that $R(x)=e^{r(x)}$ is increasing . Furthermore on $I$ the function $R(x)$ is concave and I have not a proof of it yet . We deduce that the function $R(x)^{R(x)}$ is convex on $I$ . To show it differentiate twice and use a general form like : $(n(m(x)))''=R(x)^{R(x)}$ and we have on $I$ : $$n''(m(x))(m'(x))^2\geq 0$$ And : $$m''(x)n'(m(x))\geq 0$$ Because $x^x$ on $x\in I$ is convex decreasing . Conlusion : $$x^{x^{\left(x^{x}+x\right)}}$$ is convex on $I$ The same reasoning works with $x\ln(x)$ wich is convex decreasing on $I$ .
