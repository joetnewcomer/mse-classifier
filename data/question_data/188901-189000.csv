For example, suppose $M = 21$, $N = 32$, $a = 10$, $b = 4$, $c = 2$, $d = 3$.

Lastly, although I think this approach could prove the existence of such an $H$, I am unsure how to extract the ordering of function compositions to build it.

I need to achieve a similar result, but with a polynomial function. I can use a series approximation of $e^{-x^2}$: $$1 - x^2 + \frac{x^4}2 - \frac{x^6}6 + \cdots,$$ but I need my function to be accurate over the domain of $[-20000, 20000]$, which for this method requires a polynomial of a very high degree. How can I create a polynomial function of the lowest degree where the area under the curve from $x=-2$ to $2$ accounts for 99% of the total area on the domain of $x= -20000$ to $20000$? Some additional background info: My intention is to investigate the feasibility of a type of additive sound synthesis wherein the sine waves are not stored as discrete waves, but instead as a spectrogram that represents the amplitude of each partial within the signal and converting that directly into the resulting waveform, which allows for evaluating the partials by only calculating the sine of one angle, no matter how many partials there are. So the first thing I need is a function that peaks at a specified input value and quickly drops to near-zero, which I'll call $R(f)$. Each partial will also be capable of changing amplitude and frequency over time, so each partial, p will be represented by $A_p(t)R(f_p(t))$, where $A_p(t)$ represents the amplitude of the partial at time t and $f_p(t)$ represents its frequency. Now what we do is add several of these together to get a function where each x-value corresponds to a frequency and the y-values correspond to its amplitude: $y(f) = \sum_{p=1}^n R_p(f)$ Finally, to obtain the waveform, multiply by $\sin(2\pi f t)$ and integrate with respect to f and sample to result at distinct values of t to recreate the waveform: $\int_0^{20000} y(f) sin(2\pi f t) df$ (20000Hz is about the limit of human hearing) Some interesting things happen if $R(f)$ can be represented as a polynomial of f. Namely, y(f) will also be a polynomial of f of the same degree. Then if we instead approximate its multiplication by $sin(2\pi f t)$ with another polynomial function, evaluating the integral is trivial. There are some optimizations that can be applied to make this not so computationally demanding. For example, if we assume that the amplitude and frequency of the partials remain fairly constant, the integral can instead be evaluated by integrating by parts and only recalculating the value given by the part involving y(f) every few-hundred samples. Now if you're wondering why I need the function to be valid from -20000 to 20000, that's because a function peaking at +20000 must still be near-zero at x=0, 20000 units to the left and when centered at x=0, in should be near-zero 20000 units to the right. So the function should extend 20000 units on either side. Also, the requirement for 99% of the area to be within $[-2, 2]$ comes from the fact that each partial should ideally be just 1 frequency. In the case of it actually being spread across a full 4Hz, it creates an interference pattern with itself that causes its amplitude to be modulated in undesirable ways, although it can be somewhat countered by an intelligent $A_p(t)$","The function $f(x) = e^{-x^2}$ has a bell-shaped peak at $x=0$ and then approaches an asymptote at $y=0$.

So I believe $\phi$ is not continuous since $\phi^{-1}(\{1\})=\{b\}$ is not open in $B$ as $\{b\}$, as a singleton, cannot possibly have one of the three forms of intervals in $\mathcal{B}$.

73,$n$-tuples as functions - why do they need to be surjective?,-tuples as functions - why do they need to be surjective?,n,"The idea of using n-tuples to represent functions is introduced in Terence Tao's Analysis I ex 3.5.2: Suppose we define an ordered $n$ -tuple to be a surjective function $x > : \{i \in N : 1 \leq i \leq n\} \to X$ whose codomain is some arbitrary set $X$ (so different ordered n-tuples are allowed to have different ranges); we then write $x_i$ for $x(i)$ and also write $x$ as $(x_i)_{1 \leq i \leq n}$ . Using this definition, verify that we have $(x_i)_{1 \leq i \leq n} = (y_i)_{1 \leq i \leq n}$ if and only if $x_i = y_i$ for all $1 \leq i \leq n$ . Question: Why does the function need to be surjective ? My Thoughts Initially I thought this was to ensure the range of the function was fully accounted for by the n-tuple. However, Tao is quite precise in using range and codomain precisely, so I don't think this is an avenue worth pursuing. Then I thought about the traditional textbook approach of considering the definition of surjective - that every element of the codomain has an element in the domain which is mapped to it. But that line of thinking doesn't seem to help here. Exploring this site, I can see that surjectivity is only needed for the later part of the exercise: Also, show that if $(X_i)_{1 \leq i \leq n}$ are an ordered n-tuple of sets, then the Cartesian product, as defined in Definition 3.5.6, is indeed a set.

The function $\exp(A)$ is probably the most noteworthy example of a matrix function (do correct me if I’m wrong). One of the beauties of functions is their visualizations; graphs, vector fields, linear transformations, and so on. Now, I think that a valid question to ask is How do we visualize matrix functions? It would require, for the bare minimum of $2 \times 2$ matrices; 8 dimensions…? However, we already have two main methods for visualizing $4$ -dimensional functions; transformations, and the one I prefer, vector fields. Is there something analogous to transformations or vector fields to visualize them?

96,"Faulty generalization of $(-1)^{z}$, is there a hole in my argument","Faulty generalization of , is there a hole in my argument",(-1)^{z},"I am an Vietnamese grade 12 student. We were studying about exponential functions until I read the part that writes: For the function $f(x) = a^{x}$ , we always assume a is an positive real number that is not 1. In other words, $0< a \neq 1$ . What would happen if we set an $a$ that violates those properties? $a = 0$ and $a = 1$ yields pretty boring results (we would have $$f(x) = \begin{cases} 0 & x\subset \mathbb{R} \setminus \left \{ 0 \right \}\\undefined & x = 0\end{cases}$$ and $f(x) = 1$ ). AFter all, for complex numbers we defined the factorial and Fibonacci numbers , which are definitely much more difficult to define. What if we let $a$ be some negative number instead? Due to the rule $a^{x} b^{x} = (ab)^{x}$ (if we assume it holds anyway), we only need to define exponentiation for $-1$ , since if we somehow made a function that is $(-1)^{x}$ , we can define $a^{b}$ for all $a$ and $b$ in $\mathbb{R}$ (except $a = 0$ and $b = 0$ ) by writing $$a^{b} =\left | a \right |^{b} sgn(a)^{b} $$ Now onto the actual topic. Using GeoGebra, I plotted a few points in space. Due to the nature of this function, it is impossible to plot a consistent line. Points on GeoGebra . I noticed that the function $f(x) = (-1)^{x}$ also has the following properties: It is periodic with period 2 since : $(-1)^{x + 2} = (-1)^{x} 1^{2} = (-1)^{x}$ It takes values at $-1$ for odd integer inputs and $1$ for even integer inputs. These are also its maximum and minimum values over $\mathbb{N}$ The generalization I suggest will have these properties: Continuous over $\mathbb{R}$ Has maximum value $1$ at even integer inputs and minimum value at $-1$ at odd integer inputs. Therefore I suggest one such generalization is $f(x) = (-1)^{x} =\cos (\pi x)$ . This would also allow negative exponentiation to expand indefinitely to the complex numbers, since $\cos (\pi x)$ is well-defined over $\mathbb{C}$ . Is there a hole in my argument?

The problem asks to show that if $f$ satisfies ( for all $x,y$ real): $$f(xy+x+y) = f(xy)+f(x)+f(y),$$ then $f$ must also satisfy $$f(x+y) = f(x)+f(y).$$ I tried contrapositive.

This gives us a collection of points that, if the functional equation is true, also do not hold for second equation.

Here is my attempt. Suppose $f(m,n) = f(p,q)$ for $(m,n), (p,q) \in \mathbb{R}^2$ . Then $(p + q, p + 2q) = (m + n, m + 2n)$ , and we have $$ p + q = m + n, \qquad p + 2q = m + 2n.  $$ But then $$ p + 2q = (p+q) + q = (m+n) + q = (m+n) + n, $$ and cancelling $m+n$ gives $q = n$ . Substituting into the first equation, we get $m = p$ . Therefore, $(m,n) = (p,q)$ , so $f$ is injective. Now, we prove that $f$ is surjective. Let $(a,b) \in \mathbb{R}^2$ . We will find $u(a,b), v(a,b)$ such that $f(u,v) = (a,b)$ . We have: $$ f(u,v) = (u+v, u + 2v) = (a,b), $$ so $u + v = a$ and $u + 2v = b$ . In particular, $u = a - v$ , and substituting into the second equation gives $$ b = u + 2v =  (a-v) + 2v = v + a.  $$ So $b = v + a$ , and hence $v = b - a$ . Then $$ u = a - v = a - (b-a) = 2a - b. $$ To check that these formulas work, we have: $$ f(2a - b, b - a) = ((2a - b) + (b-a), (2a-b) + 2(b-a)) = (a, b), $$ so $f$ is surjective, hence bijective.
