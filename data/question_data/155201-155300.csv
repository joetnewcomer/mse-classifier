16,Does $(n^p-1)/(n-1)=m^2$ have any positive integer solutions for $p\ge 2$ prime?,Does  have any positive integer solutions for  prime?,(n^p-1)/(n-1)=m^2 p\ge 2,"I was working on my partial answer to this question, which led me to consider the diophantine equation $$ \frac{n^k-1}{n-1}=m^2 $$ with $k>1$ odd. It's not too hard to prove that if $(n,k)$ is a solution, then if $k$ is a perfect square, $(n,p^2)$ is a solution for all $p\mid k$ , and otherwise $(n,p)$ is a solution for $p\mid k$ the largest prime factor of $k$ with $\operatorname{ord}_p(k)$ odd. Therefore, it is natural to ask whether there are any solutions with $k=p$ prime. I have absolutely no idea to start. Perhaps note that $$(m^2)=\prod_{i=1}^{p-1}\left(n-\zeta_p^i\right)\subseteq\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_p],$$ and that all the ideals in this product are pairwise coprime. Therefore, they must all be squares of ideals in $\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_p]$ . Also, if $q\mid m$ is prime, then $q\equiv 1\pmod p$ and the decomposition of $(q)$ in $\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_p]$ is $$ (q) = \prod_{i=1}^{p-1}\left(q,n-\zeta_p^i\right), $$ whence $\left(q,n-\zeta_p\right)^2\mid \left(n-\zeta_p\right)$ . I have no idea to continue. Perhaps if the class group of $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_p)/\mathbb{Q}$ has odd order, we can use that $(n-\zeta_p)$ must be the square of a principal ideal? Descending solutions: Suppose $(n,k)$ is a solution and $p^2\mid k$ for some prime $p$ , then $$ \frac{n^k-1}{n^{k/p^2}-1}\cdot \frac{n^{k/p^2}-1}{n-1} = m^2. $$ Let $q\mid n^{k/{p^2}}-1$ be prime, then $\frac{n^k-1}{n^{k/p^2}-1}=\sum_{j=0}^{p^2}(n^{k/p^2})^j\equiv p^2\pmod q$ . Hence, the only prime that can possibly divide both $\frac{n^k-1}{n^{k/p^2}-1}$ and $\frac{n^{k/p^2}-1}{n-1}$ is $p$ . However, if $p$ divides both, let $t:=\operatorname{ord}_p(n^{k/p^2}-1)$ and let $g$ be a primitive root mod $p^{t+3}$ . Write $n^{k/p^2}\equiv g^a\pmod {p^{t+3}}$ , then $\operatorname{ord}_p(a)=t-1$ , whence $\operatorname{ord}_p(p^2a)=t+1$ , so $\operatorname{ord}_p(n^k-1)=t+2$ . We conclude that $\frac{n^k-1}{n^{k/p^2}-1}$ and $\frac{n^{k/p^2}-1}{n-1}$ are both perfect squares. In particular, $(n,k/p^2)$ is a solution. This way, we can remove the $p^2$ factors from $n$ one by one, until we're either left with an exponent which is itself a square of a prime (if $k$ is a perfect square) or with a square-free exponent. Assume we end up with a solution $(n,k)$ with $k$ square-free. Let $p\mid k$ be the smallest prime factor of $k$ . Note that the product of $(n^k-1)/(n^{k/p}-1)$ and $(n^{k/p}-1)/(n-1)$ is a perfect square, and that $p$ is the only prime that can possibly divide both. However, $(p-1,k/p)=1$ , so if $p\mid n^{k/p}-1$ then $p\mid n-1$ and $p\nmid (n^{k/p}-1)/(n-1)$ . Therefore, $(n^{k/p}-1)/(n-1)$ is a perfect square, and $(n,k/p)$ a new solution. This is how we can remove the primes from $k$ one by one, until only the largest remains.","I was working on my partial answer to this question, which led me to consider the diophantine equation with odd.

51,Сharacteristic property of polynomials with integer coefficients,Сharacteristic property of polynomials with integer coefficients,,"Here is the problem which was proposed on some contest. Problem. Polymomial $P(x)$ is satisfying the following conditions If $x\in\mathbb{Z}$ then $P(x)\in \mathbb{Z}$ ; For every positive integer $n$ and for every integer $x$ the sequence $x, P(x), P(P(x)), \dots$ is periodic modulo $n$ . Prove that $P(x)\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ i. e. all coefficients of $P(x)$ are integers. Comment. In this problem we call the sequence $\{a_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ periodic if there are positive integers $n_0$ and $t$ such that for all $n\ge n_0$ the equality $a_{n}=a_{n+t}$ holds. It's well-known that all polynomials which satisfy first condition are linear combinations with integer coefficients of polynimials $p_k(x)$ , where $$ p_k(x):=\binom{x}{k}=\frac{x(x-1)\ldots(x-k+1)}{k!}. $$ Hence, there are integers $c_0,c_1,\ldots, c_n$ such that $$ P(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{n}c_k\cdot p_k(x). $$ Then, we need to prove that $k!\mid c_k$ for $k\ge 0$ (it's equivalent to $P(x)\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ ). However, it's unclear how we should use the second condition. It can be shown that polynomial $c\cdot p_r(x)$ where $r$ is a prime number doesn't satisfy the second condition if $r\nmid c$ (consider modulo $n=r$ in the second condition; it requires some work). It's hard even in this case to prove that $r!\mid c$ . Moreover, it's clear that polynomials with integer coefficients satisfy both conditions. That's why this actually is a characteristic property of such polynomials. Let me explain why the polynomial $P(x)=\frac{x(x-1)}{2}$ doesn't satisfy the conditions of the problem. Proof. Suppose the contrary. Define the sequence $\{x_k\}_{k=1}^{\infty}$ as follows: $$ x_0=4, \\ x_{k+1}=P(x_k). $$ It's clear that $\{x_n\}_{k=1}^{\infty}$ is an increasing sequence of positive integers. From the second condtion for $n=2$ we obtain that there are positive integers $k_0$ and $t$ such that $x_{k+t}\equiv x_k\pmod 2$ for all $k\ge k_0$ . Hence, for all $k\ge k_0$ we have $x_{k+t}-x_k\equiv 0\pmod 2$ . Note that $x_{k_0+t}-x_{k_0}>0$ , so there is an $s$ such that $2^s\mid x_{k_0+t}-x_{k_0}$ , but $2^{s+1}\nmid x_{k_0+t}-x_{k_0}$ . Now, define the new sequence $\{a_k\}_{k=k_0}^{\infty}$ as $a_k:=x_{k+t}-x_k$ . Notice that $a_k\equiv 0\pmod 2$ for all $k$ and $$ a_{k+1}=P(x_{k+t})-P(x_k)=\frac{x_{k+t}-x_k}{2}\cdot(x_{k+t}+x_k+1)= \frac{a_k}{2}\cdot(x_{k+t}+x_k+1). $$ Due to our assumption $x_{k+t}+x_k+1$ is an odd number. Thus, the sequence of 2-adic valuations of $a_k$ is a strcictly decreasing sequence, which is impossible beacuse all $a_k$ are integers (or, equivalently, $a_{k_0+s}$ is odd which contradicts $a_{k}\equiv 0\pmod 2$ ). Therefore, $P(x)$ doesn't satisfy the conditions of the problem, as desired. How we can approach this problem? Update.

Or in other words, if two decimal numbers are equal to $N_{10}$ significant figures, what is the number of significant figures, $N_{2}$, to which I need to compare them in binary, so that I get the same result? Example: Let $N_{10} = 2$, i.e. we will be comparing to $2$ significant figures in base 10. In this case: $$ 100 = 102 \text{ (both round to 100)} $$ $$ 105 = 114 \text{ (both round to 110)} $$ In binary $100_{10} = 1100100_{2}, 102_{10} = 1100110_{2}, 105_{10} = 1101001_{2}, 114_{10} = 1110010_{2}$. From this particular example, it appears that $N_{2} = 3$. Why I ask this: I am trying to implement efficient equality comparison which respects number of significant figures. Ultimately, I would want it to achieve everything in binary using cheap shift operations.",,"['number-theory', 'discrete-mathematics', 'algorithms', 'binary', 'number-systems']"

So Beal's conjecture states that there are no solutions to the equation $A^X+B^Y=C^Z$ where $A,B,C,X,Y,Z\in\Bbb{N}\space |\space X,Y,Z \ge 3$ and $gcd(A,B)=gcd(B,C)=gcd(A,C)=1$ (As far as I'm aware this has not been proven or disproven yet.)

A generating function isn't necessary. (Although it would be extremely cool if someone finds one.) Every equation which consists only of integer terms has an even number of odd terms. There can't be zero odd terms in {1} because $\pm 1$ is odd. There can't be two odd terms in {1} because that implies that there are two even terms and therefore one of the three gcd pairs isn't one. This leaves the only possibility that all terms in {1} are odd. Only odd bases can generate odd power numbers so $A$ , $B$ , and $C$ are all odd.

Let $x$ be a positive integer such that $x > 1$ . Let $y$ be a prime such that $y > x$ . Then, $x$ is either prime or not prime. In case it's prime, clearly $gcd(x,y)=1$ . Since $x! = x*(x-1)...1$ and $ x \ge (x-1) \ge (x-2) ... \ge 1$ . So each factor of the factorial is smaller than $y$ and has no common factor with it (for $y$ is prime). Hence, $x!$ has no common divisors with $y$ besides 1, from which follows $gcd(x!,y)=1$ . Assuming $x$ to be not prime. By the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, $x$ can be written as a product of primes $\mathrm{p_1}^{a_1}$ $\mathrm{p_2}^{a_2}$ ... $\mathrm{p_n}^{a_n}$ . We know that any $\mathrm{p_i}^{a_i} \le y$ thus having no common factors with $y$ annd $gcd(x,y)=1$ .
