96,Do these triangles with parallel hypotenuses?,Do these triangles with parallel hypotenuses?,,"This originated as a question that I encountered while woodworking, but nerdy me had to try and see if there was a solution.  Say I have two right triangles, and each of them have the same angles, but one is slightly larger than the other (with the right angle for both at the origin).  Arranging the triangles on top of one another in this way means that the hypotenuses are parallel and separated by a certain amount.  If I pick the most acute angle and name it theta, I know and can express three specific pieces of information (in addition to the obvious piece that one angle is 90 degrees for each triangle): The length of the opposite side of the larger triangle is 0.5. The length of the adjacent side of the smaller triangle is 1.5. The separation between the two hypotenuses is 0.125. The question is, can I solve the remaining pieces of information to fully define these triangles?  I know that you generally need three pieces of info to solve for any given triangle, and I don't have that for each individual triangle, I only have two pieces of information per triangle.  But I do have a fixed and known relationship between the two the separation of the parallel hypotenuses) which I feel like I ought to be able to use in some way as my third piece of information.

97,An elementary proof of $\sum_{l=0}^{n-1} \cos(\frac{2\pi kl}{n})^2=\frac{n}{2}$? (without character theory),An elementary proof of ? (without character theory),\sum_{l=0}^{n-1} \cos(\frac{2\pi kl}{n})^2=\frac{n}{2},"Recently I have stumbled upon the following identity: if $n>2$ and $1\leq k\leq\lfloor\frac{n-1}{2}\rfloor$ , then $\sum_{l=0}^{n-1}\cos(\frac{2\pi kl}{n})^2=\frac{n}{2}$ . There is a lovely proof of this using character theory: let $D_{2n}$ be the dihedral group $\langle r, s\space|\space r^n=1, s^2=1, rs=sr^{-1}\rangle$ . We define the complex representation $\rho_k:D_{2n}\rightarrow\text{GL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ by $s\mapsto\begin{bmatrix}0&1\\1&0\end{bmatrix}$ and $r\mapsto\begin{bmatrix}\cos(\frac{2\pi k}{n})&\sin(\frac{2\pi k}{n})\\-\sin(\frac{2\pi k}{n})&\cos(\frac{2\pi k}{n})\end{bmatrix}$ . Clearly $\rho_k$ is irreducible; indeed, given $(z_1, z_2)^{tr}\in\mathbb{C}^2\setminus\{(0,0)^{tr}\}$ , because $0<\frac{2\pi k}{n}<\pi$ we have that $\rho_k(r) (z_1, z_2)^{tr}$ and $(z_1, z_2)^{tr}$ are linearly independent, and hence together form a basis for $\mathbb{C}^2$ . Now, let $\langle\cdot|\cdot\rangle$ be the canonical inner product on the vector space of class functions on $D_{2n}$ , so that if $\chi_1,\chi_2:D_{2n}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ are class functions then $\langle\chi_1|\chi_2\rangle=\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in D_{2n}}\chi_1(g^{-1})\chi_2(g)$ . Recall that the irreducible characters of $D_{2n}$ form an orthonormal basis for the space of class functions, and so in particular we must have $\langle\chi_{\rho_k}|\chi_{\rho_k}\rangle=1$ . The elements of $D_{2n}$ are of course all of the form $r^l$ and $sr^l$ , $0\leq l\leq n-1$ . We have $\rho_k(r^l)=\begin{bmatrix}\cos(\frac{2\pi kl}{n})&\sin(\frac{2\pi kl}{n})\\-\sin(\frac{2\pi kl}{n})&\cos(\frac{2\pi kl}{n})\end{bmatrix}$ , so $\chi_{\rho_k}(r^l)=2\cos(\frac{2\pi kl}{n})$ , and likewise $\rho_k(sr^l)=\begin{bmatrix}\sin(\frac{2\pi kl}{n})&\cos(\frac{2\pi kl}{n})\\\cos(\frac{2\pi kl}{n})&-\sin(\frac{2\pi kl}{n})\end{bmatrix}$ , so $\chi_{\rho_k}(sr^l)=0$ . Because $\cos$ is even we additionally have $\chi_{\rho_k}(r^l)=\chi_{\rho_k}(r^{-l})$ . Combining these facts gives $1=\langle\chi_{\rho_k}|\chi_{\rho_k}\rangle=\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in D_{2n}}\chi_{\rho_k}(g^{-1})\chi_{\rho_k}(g)=\frac{1}{2n}\sum_{l=0}^{n-1}(2\cos(\frac{2\pi kl}{n}))^2$ , whence we obtain the desired equality. This is in my view quite a nice application of representation theory to an identity not immediately obviously related to it. However, I am wondering whether this is in fact the simplest proof. Can anyone find a more elementary way of deducing of this identity?","Recently I have stumbled upon the following identity: if and , then .

98,Find the number of solutions for this trig-algebraic equation: $x^2 -x \sin x - \cos x =0$,Find the number of solutions for this trig-algebraic equation:,x^2 -x \sin x - \cos x =0,"The number of points in $(-\infty, \infty)$ for which $x^2 -x \sin x - \cos x =0$ , are? The first thought that came to my my mind was that the equation above is looking like a algebraic quadratic equation, and those equations have at most two different solutions. But this equation is the mixture of algebraic and trigonometric functions. Having some experience with a similar problem I proceeded like this $$ x^2 - x \sin x = \cos x \\ x(x- \sin x ) = \cos x$$ $$ -1 \leq \cos x \leq 1 \\ -1 \leq x(x-\sin x ) \leq 1 $$ $$x(x-\sin x ) = -1 \tag{1}$$ $$x(x-\sin x ) = 1  \tag{2} $$ $$ x-1 \leq x - \sin x  \leq x+1 \tag{i}$$ $$x-1 \leq -\frac{1}{x} \leq x+1 ~~~~~~~~~~\text{from equation (1)} \\ x-1 = \frac{-1}{x}  ~~~~~~~~~~~~; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ x+1 = \frac{-1}{x} \\ x^2 - x +1 =0 ~~~~~~~~~~~~; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ x^2 + x +1 = 0$$ Above two equations have no real solutions.

But this answer of mine is not correct, drawing the graph from desmos shows there are just two intersections of $x-axis$ . I'm in need of an explanation of why my solution is giving a wrong answer, and I have two more questions: I felt suspicious when I equated $x(x-\sin x) = \{1, -1\}$ , because what the inequality says is that $x(x-\sin x)$ lies between $-1$ and $1$ , so I could very well equated $x(x-\sin x)$ to any number in between $[-1 , 1]$ but I did not. Could I equate it with any number in between? The solutions of the last two quadratic equations differ from the other's pair only in signs, so it seems to me that there is some minor issue but cannot find it. Is there a specific reason that I'm off to actual answer just due to the consideration  of signs?","The number of points in for which , are?
