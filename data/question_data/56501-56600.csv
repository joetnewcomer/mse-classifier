I am wondering how this kind of infinite sum can be handled. Any hints or suggestions are welcomed, perhaps by proposing some ideas to simplify it or making some approximations. @Dr. Wolfgang Hintze Thank you very much for the detailed explanation. I have a question, when I try to plot the double sum I get an error ''NSum :Summand (or its derivative)... - is not numerical at point r = 0 ''? To plot it I just wrote this : What is the problem in this formula?",,['sequences-and-series']
17,Convergence of complex sequence $z_{n}$,Convergence of complex sequence,z_{n},"A complex number is written in de form of $z=x+iy$, with $x,y \in \mathbb{R}$. We can call a sequence ($z_{n}$) of complex numbers convergent with limit $z^{*} \in \mathbb{C}$ if $\forall \varepsilon > 0: \exists n_{0} \in \mathbb{N} : \forall n \geq n_{0} : \vert z_{n} - z^{*} \vert < \varepsilon$. Let $z_{n} = x_{n} + iy_{n}$ and $z^{*} =x^{*}+iy^{*}$, then $\vert z_{n} - z^{*} \vert = \sqrt{(x_{n} - x^{*})^{2} + (y_{n} - y^{*})^{2}}$. $\textbf{Question:}$ Let $(z_{n})$ be a sequence of complex numbers. Take $x_{n}=$ Re $z_{n}$ and $y_{n} =$ Im $z_{n}$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Then $x_{n}$ and $y_{n}$ are both real sequences. Proof that $z_{n}$ is convergent if and only if the two sequences $x_{n}$ and $y_{n}$ are both convergent. I started by proving the reverse of the theorem: Suppose $x_{n}$ is convergent, so that $\lim_{n\to\infty} x_{n} = x^{*}$. Then $\forall \varepsilon > 0: \exists n_{1} \in \mathbb{N} : \forall n \geq n_{1} : \vert x_{n} - x^{*} \vert < \frac{\varepsilon}{\sqrt{2}}$. Also, suppose that $y_{n}$ is convergent, so that $\lim_{n\to\infty} y_{n} = y^{*}$. Then $\forall \varepsilon > 0: \exists n_{2} \in \mathbb{N} : \forall n \geq n_{2} : \vert y_{n} - y^{*} \vert < \frac{\varepsilon}{\sqrt{2}}$. Then, $\vert x_{n}-x^{*}\vert^{2}<\frac{\varepsilon^{2}}{2}$ and also $\vert y_{n}-y^{*}\vert^{2}<\frac{\varepsilon^{2}}{2}$. If we add both inequalities together, we get after some calculations $\sqrt{(x_{n}-x^{*})^{2}+(y_{n}-y^{*})^{2}}<\varepsilon$. This holds $\forall \varepsilon > 0$ and $\forall n \geq max \lbrace n_{1},n_{2}\rbrace$, by which follows that $z_{n}$ is convergent and $\lim_{n\to\infty} z_{n} = z^{*}$. I'm not sure whether this proof is fully correct and I also have no idea how to proof the theorem the other way around.","A complex number is written in de form of $z=x+iy$, with $x,y \in \mathbb{R}$.
