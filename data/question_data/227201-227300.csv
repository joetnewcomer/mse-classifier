7,"Why are exterior products so much ""wigglier"" than symmetric and tensor products?","Why are exterior products so much ""wigglier"" than symmetric and tensor products?",,"Apologies in advance that this is a somewhat soft question. Let $k$ be an infinite field. Fix a dimension $d$ and let $v_1,\dots,v_r$ , $w_1,\dots,w_r$ be two tuples of linearly independent vectors in $k^d$ . (Thus, assume $r\leq d$ .) We have that the exterior products $v_1\wedge\dots\wedge v_r$ and $w_1\wedge\dots\wedge w_r$ are equal if and only if the $w_i$ 's can be expressed in terms of the $v_i$ 's via a matrix in the special linear group $SL(r,k)$ . It follows that the map to the $r$ th exterior power $$\wedge^r:(k^d)^{\times r} \rightarrow \Lambda^rk^d$$ that carries $$(v_1,\dots,v_r)\mapsto v_1\wedge\dots\wedge v_r$$ has fibers generically the size of $SL(r,k)$ , which has dimension $r^2-1$ as an algebraic variety over $k$ . Now consider the same question with the symmetric and tensor powers in place of the exterior power. For the symmetric power, it seems to me we have $v_1\dots v_r = w_1\dots w_r$ (if and) only if there are elements $\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_r\in k$ and a permutation $\sigma\in S_r$ (the symmetric group on $r$ elements) satisfying $\prod \alpha_i=1$ , and $w_i=\alpha_iv_{\sigma(i)}$ for all $i$ . I'll include an argument in a postscript, but if this is right, this means that the fibers of the map to the symmetric power $$ \Pi^r: (k^d)^{\times r} \rightarrow S^rk^d$$ given by $$ (v_1,\dots,v_r) \mapsto v_1\dots v_r $$ has fibers generically the size of the group $L\times S_r$ , where $L$ is the set of matrices $\operatorname{diag}(\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_r)$ with the $\alpha_i$ 's as above, i.e. the diagonal matrices in $SL(r,k)$ . This group has dimension $r-1$ as a $k$ -variety. Aside: I don't know a standard name for this map to the symmetric power. I am calling it $\Pi^r$ because if one interprets the symmetric algebra over $k^d$ as a polynomial ring, then it is just taking a product. And then the more restrictive condition $v_1\otimes\dots\otimes v_r = w_1\otimes \dots\otimes w_r$ should only be met when $w_i = \alpha_iv_i$ for some $\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_r\in k$ with $\prod\alpha_i=1$ , as above, so the map $$\otimes^r : (k^d)^{\times r} \rightarrow (k^d)^{\otimes r}$$ given by $$(v_1,\dots,v_r)\mapsto v_1\otimes\dots\otimes v_r$$ has fibers generically bijecting just with $L = \{\operatorname{diag}(\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_r)\}$ , again, dimension $r-1$ . It is really bothering me that the fibers of $\Pi^r$ and $\otimes^r$ are the same dimension, and this dimension is so much smaller than the dimension of the fibers of $\wedge^r$ . Can you offer any insight about why this is happening? (Or is my reasoning incorrect and it's not actually happening?) Here is a little more about why it is bothering me. I normally think of the exterior algebra as quite a bit ""smaller"" than the symmetric algebra, but both are ""massively smaller"" than the tensor algebra. I mean this informally, but some form of it is true precisely: the dimension of $\Lambda^rk^d$ is $\binom{d}{r}$ which $\to 0$ as $r\to \infty$ ; that of $S^rk^d$ is $\binom{r+d-1}{d-1}$ , which is polynomial in $r$ of degree $d-1$ ; and that of $(k^d)^{\otimes r}$ is $d^r$ , which is obviously exponential in $r$ . In view of this, it's intuitive to me that the fibers of the map into the exterior power are the biggest (since smaller target perhaps forces bigger fibers), but it is confusing that the fibers of of the maps into the symmetric and tensor powers are the same size (well, at least same dimension), given how massively different in size the targets are. As I write this, it occurs to me that, well, the source $(k^d)^{\times r}$ only has dimension $dr$ , so $S^rk^d$ and $(k^d)^{\otimes r}$ both contain ""plenty of room"" to accommodate the source, while for some values of $r,d$ , the dimension of $\Lambda^rk^d$ is much smaller than that of the source, forcing the fibers to embiggen. But this doesn't really feel explanatory to me, especially in view of the fact that, per the calculation above, none of the generic fiber sizes ever depend on $d$ (except inasmuch as the assumption $r\leq d$ is satisfied). Can you offer any insight into what's going on? Postscript: Here is my argument that $v_1\dots v_r = w_1\dots w_r$ (if and) only if there are elements $\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_r\in k$ and a permutation $\sigma\in S_r$ (the symmetric group on $r$ elements) satisfying $\prod \alpha_i=1$ , and $w_i=\alpha_iv_{\sigma(i)}$ for all $i$ . Extend $v_1,\dots,v_r$ to a basis of $k^d$ . Interpret $S^\star k^d$ as the polynomial algebra over $k$ in $d$ indeterminates, but choose the indeterminates to be the basis just constructed; in particular, $v_1,\dots,v_r$ will be indeterminates, while $w_1,\dots,w_r$ will be linear forms. Then $v_1\dots v_r$ is a monomial and $w_1\dots w_r$ is a homogeneous polynomial of degree $r$ . Suppose we have $v_1\dots v_r = w_1\dots w_r$ . A product of linear forms is not a monomial unless each linear form is a monomial. (One way to see this is to fix a monomial order; then the leading term and ""trailing term"" in an expanded product will be distinct unless each factor is a monomial.) Thus each $w_i$ is a coefficient times a single indeterminate. Furthermore, these indeterminates must coincide with $v_1,\dots,v_r$ in some order, or else $w_1\dots w_r$ and $v_1\dots v_r$ will be linearly independent. This establishes that there is a permutation $\sigma\in S_r$ and some numbers $\alpha_i\in k$ such that $w_i = \alpha_i v_{\sigma(i)}$ for all $i=1,\dots,r$ . Thus the assumed equality $\prod v_i = \prod w_i$ becomes $\prod v_i = \prod \alpha_i \prod v_i$ , and $\prod \alpha_i = 1$ follows.","Apologies in advance that this is a somewhat soft question.

We call $p$ non-zero if $c(\alpha)\neq 0$ for some $\alpha.$ For all non-zero $p$ does there exist $\alpha$ such that $c(\alpha)\neq 0$ and $p(\alpha)\neq 0$ ? Equivalently: for all finite $A\subset\mathbb N_0^d,$ is the $|A|\times |A|$ matrix defined by $M_{\alpha,\beta}=(\alpha_1^{\beta_1}\dots\alpha_d^{\beta_d})$ non-singular? (In one direction. take $A$ to be the support of a counterexample $c,$ which is then in the kernel of $M.$ In the other direction, take $c$ to be a vector in the kernel of a counterexample $M.$ ) Call $A$ ""good"" if this holds. I have checked some randomly generated sets $A$ are good. Also: If $A\subset \mathbb N_0^d$ and $B\subset \mathbb N_0^e$ are both non-empty and good then the Cartesian product $A\times B\subset\mathbb N_0^{d+e}$ is good. In terms of matrices this is because the Kronecker product of two positive-dimensional square matrices is non-singular iff the two matrices are non-singular. Let $A\subset \mathbb N_0^{d+1}.$ If the sets defined by $A_0=\{\alpha\in A\mid \alpha_{d+1}=0\}$ and $A_+=\{\alpha\in A\mid \alpha_{d+1}>0\}$ are good then $A$ is good. Proof: assume $A_0$ and $A_+$ are good and consider a polynomial $p$ with coefficients $c$ zero outside $A.$ If $p(\alpha)=0$ for $\alpha\in A_0$ then $c(\alpha)=0$ for all $\alpha\in A_0,$ because $A_0$ is good and the $A_+$ coefficients don't contribute to $p(x)$ when $x_{d+1}=0.$ So $c$ is zero outside $A_+,$ and hence $p$ must also be zero on $A_+$ because $A_+$ is good. If $A\subset \mathbb N_0^1$ then $A$ is good. Proof: by the last point we can assume $0\not\in A.$ By Descartes' rule of signs a univariate polynomial with at most $|A|$ non-zero coefficients has at most $|A|-1$ positive zeroes. $A\subset \mathbb N_0^d$ is good if it is downwards-closed, i.e. for all $\beta\in A$ and all $\alpha$ such that $\alpha_i\leq\beta_i$ for all $1\leq i\leq d$ we have $\alpha\in A.$ Proof: apply the forward difference operator $(\Delta p)(x)=p(x_1,\dots,x_{d-1},x_d+1)-p(x).$ By induction $A'=\{\alpha \in A\mid (\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_d+1)\in A\}$ is good. If $p$ had zero coefficients outside $A$ and also vanished on $A,$ then $\Delta p$ would have zero coefficients outside $A'$ and vanish on $A',$ which forces $\Delta p$ to be the zero polynomial. This means $p$ has zero coefficients outside $A_0$ (as defined in the last point) and we can apply induction on dimension. A small variation: if $A\subset \mathbb N_0^d$ is downwards closed and $\alpha\in\mathbb N_0^d$ then the shifted set $\alpha+A=\{\alpha+\beta\mid \beta\in A\}$ is good.

So, suppose we have a universal family $\pi:\mathcal{C}\rightarrow \overline{M}_g$ and let $[C]\in \overline{M}_g$. Let $\xi:\mathcal{X}\rightarrow (X,x_0)$ be a Kuranishi family of $C$. On the one hand there exists a neighborhood $V$ of $[C]$ in $\overline{M}_g$ and a map $f:V\rightarrow X$ such that $\pi|_V$ is the pullback of $\xi$ via $f$. On the other hand, there exists a map $h:X\rightarrow \overline{M}_g$ such that $\xi$ is the pullback of $\pi$ via $h$. By considering the composition $f\circ h$ (and restricting to a neighborhood of $x_0$) we are supposed to get a family differing from a Kuranishi family by at most  an automorphism of the central fiber. I do not understand why this is true. Anyway, this implies that $f\circ h$ is an automorphism and therefore $h$ is injective. Nevertheless, if $\gamma\in Aut(C)\setminus\{id\}$ then $\gamma$ acts non-trivially on $V$ and $h$ sends any orbit of $Aut(C)$ to the same point of $\overline{M}_g$. We reach a contradiction.

I just followed the construction of the group-scheme structure on elliptic curves given by Vakil in his notes (that you can find here ). Right after this, he gives a pretty concrete exercise (page 522) for which I would like some hints as to how to solve it efficiently. Here is the statement of the exercise. Let $k$ be a field. Consider the genus $1$ curve $C\subset \mathbb{P}^2_k$  given by    $$y^2z=x^3+x^2z$$   with the point $\mathbb{p}=[0,1,0]$. Emulate ""the above argument"" to show that $C \setminus \{[0,0,1]\}$ is a group variety. Show that it is isomorphic to $\mathbb{G}_m$ (the multiplicative group-scheme $\operatorname{Spec}(k[t,t^{-1}])$) with coordinate $t=\frac{y}{x}$ by giving an isomorphism of schemes, and showing that multiplication and inverse in both group-varieties agree under this isomorphism. Okay, there are multiple things going on here. I am going to ask a few questions about this. Some of them may be pretty basic, but I think that this exercise would is a perfect occasion to clear up a few confusions in my mind about basic computations in algebraic geometry. In the following, let $U$ denote $C \setminus \{[0,0,1]\}$. First , to justify that $U$ has a natural structure of scheme, I prove that $[0,0,1]$ is a closed point by computing its residue field in the distinguished open set $z\not = 0$. Here, $C$ becomes the affine curve $y^2=x^3+x^2$ in $\mathbb{A}^2_k=\operatorname{Spec}(k[x,y])$ and the point we are interested in is $(0,0)$. Its residue field is the quotient field of the integral domain $A/(x,y)$, where $A=k[x,y]/(y^2-x^2-x^3)$. This integral domain actually already is a field, none other than $k$. As a result, $[0,0,1]$ is a closed point of $C$ of degree $1$. Is this method the correct way to proceed? Is there a more straightforward way to see it? Second , to show that $U$ comes with a structure of group-variety, I actually need to show that it is a subgroup-scheme of $C$, ie that it is stable under the group laws and contains the neutral point $\mathbb{p}$. Actually, I do not really understand which "" above argument "" Vakil is refering to here. From what I can tell, I have to check by hand that whenever I consider a point in $U$ and look at the line joining it to $\mathbb{p}$, then the third point of intersection with $C$ can not be $[0,0,1]$ ; and the same goes whenever I consider the line joining two arbitrary points of $U$. I think I have actually been able to show the first part, but this is quite fastidious and I feel like there must be another way to check this properly. How would you treat this part of the exercise? Third , to build the scheme-theoretic morphism between $U$ and $\mathbb{G}_m$, it is enough to give a $k$-linear morphism $k[t,t^{-1}]\rightarrow \mathcal{O}_{U}(U)$. Now, I notice that $U$ is just the union of the distinguished open sets $x\not = 0$ and $y \not = 0$, intersected with $C$. The global sections of $U$ are the pairs of global sections on each of these open sets that agree on the intersection. Global sections on each of the open sets are given by a quotient of polynomials whose denominator is non-vanishing. So I see that I could send $t$ to the pair $(\frac{y}{x},\frac{x}{y})$, but these do not agree on the intersection as far as I can tell. How does one makes sense of the statement $t=\frac{y}{x}$ given in the exercise as a hint? Fourth , I know as a general result that a proper geometrically connected curve over a field becomes affine when a finite nonzero number of points are omitted from it (see here ). Hence, it is not surprizing to see that it applies for $U$. However, is there a way to compute this affine space easily in conrete examples? Just by seeing the equation and the point we are omitting, is there a way to guess that we will obtain something nice like $\operatorname{Spec}(k[t,t^{-1}])$? How does one infer what the ring must look like? Thank you very much for reading through this. Any clarification for any of the above points will be greatly appreciated. Edit : As pointed out in the comment, $C$ is not a group-scheme, hence my second point reasoning makes no sense. Let me then replace my second point with the following: in order to show that $U$ is a group-scheme, can I simply argue that $U$ is an elliptic curve, because it is obtained by removing the singular point(s) of a genus $1$ projective curve described by a Weierstraß type equation?

74,From sheaf torsors to geometric bundles on schemes,From sheaf torsors to geometric bundles on schemes,,"$\DeclareMathOperator{\Spec}{Spec}$ $\DeclareMathOperator{\Sym}{Sym}$ $\newcommand{\func}{\mathcal{O}}$ $\newcommand{\M}{\mathcal{M}}$ It is well known that the notions of locally free $\func_X$-modules on a scheme $X$ and vector bundles on $X$ ($X$-schemes $E$ that are locally $\mathbb{A}_X^n$) are equivalent : given vector bundle, one takes the sheaf of sections, and given a locally free $\func_X$-module $\M$, the total space of the bundle is $\Spec_X(\Sym^\bullet\M^\vee)$. Given a group sheme $G$ and a $G$-torsor over $X$, is there a simple procedure that gives the total space of the torsor ? A few clarifications about the question : the general answer seems to be ""no"", according to this answer the same link refers to Milne's Etale cohomology , section III.4, where a partial answer is given. However it is not what I would call a ""simple procedure"" : I am looking for something more similar to taking the relative spectrum of the symmetric algebra for a vector bundle. however I have no hope that directly taking the relative spectrum of a clever $\func_X$-algebra will work : this is a procedure that ""takes closed subschemes"", while often a torsor will look like an ""open subscheme"" (see the following example). My question is in fact motivated by this particular case : given a locally free $\func_X$-module $\M$, we have the $GL$-torsor of trivializations of $\M$, that is the sheaf whose sections over $U\subset X$ is the set of bases of $\M(U)$ as $\func_X(U)$-module. The question becomes : Is there a simple description of the total space of the torsor of trivializations of a vector bundle $\M$ ?

By construction, locally over a sufficiently small open $U\subset X$, it is isomorphic to $\mathbb{A}^{n^2}\times U$ (with compatibility between the $U$). We can then take the open subset of points corresponding to an invertible matrix, and this gives the desired space.

Assume we're given a projective (but not necessarily non-singular) curve.

This is proposition 5.3 in [He01], and is the natural form to provide input to [He01]'s algorithm for Riemann-Roch basis space calculation.  A divisor is specified using a pair of fractional ideals, one for finite places, and one for infinite places. Another common way of specifying places is to use ideals of the coordinate ring.  So, the ideal $(x-2z, y-3z)$ would correspond to the point $(2:3:1)$ if the curve was, say, $y^2z - x^3 - z^3$. I'm trying to figure if there's some straightforward way to convert from the second representation to the first one.  I'm starting to think that there is none. Here's my logic:  Ideals in the coordinate ring correspond to (effective) Weil divisors.  Why?  Well, we can do a primary decomposition on them and get a set of associated prime ideals.

We need to work with a non-singular model of the curve for Riemann-Roch to hold, and Cartier divisors give us the ability to distinguish between multiple places over a singularity, while for Weil divisors, a singularity is just a single point. Since the [He01] formulation deals with ideals of orders of the function field , this gives the power to express Cartier divisors, while ideals of the coordinate ring are only able to express Weil divisors.

Motivation:  a positive answer would simplify the last step of Zarhin's proof that there are only finitely many abelian varieties of a given dimension over a given finite field--a key step in the proof of the Tate conjecture for abelian varieties over finite fields.  (Edit:  Tate himself used a weaker version of the finiteness statement; Zarhin's trick simplifies his proof.)  A negative answer would explain the importance of passing to the isogeny category.",,"['algebraic-geometry', 'abelian-varieties']"

99,Is it possible to blow-up in codimension one?,Is it possible to blow-up in codimension one?,,"In the context of complex manifolds, one can consider a blow-up along a complex submanifold. For a linear subspace of $\mathbb{C}^n$ there is a general procedure to perform such a blow-up: for a subspace $\mathbb{C}^m$ determined by the equations $$ z_1 = z_2 = \ldots = z_{n-m} = 0 \,, $$ we can introduce a projective space $\mathbb{CP}^{n-m-1}$ with coordinates $y_i$, and define the blown-up space $\tilde{X}$ by $$ \tilde{X} = \{(z,y)~|~z_i y_j = z_j y_i \,, ~i,j=1,\ldots,n-m\} \subset \mathbb{C}^n \times \mathbb{CP}^{n-m-1} \,, $$ with a blow-down map that simply projects onto the $\mathbb{C}^n$ factor. The equations ensure that the blow-down is an isomorphism away from the original subspace, and sends a $\mathbb{CP}^{n-m-1}$ to a point everywhere on the subspace. For codimension $n-m=1$, the above procedure doesn't define a blow-up, since $\mathbb{CP}^{n-m-1}$ is just a point. My question is: Is there any similar construction for codimension one subspaces?","In the context of complex manifolds, one can consider a blow-up along a complex submanifold.
