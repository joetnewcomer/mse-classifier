Improve this question A defining feature of radians as a unit of measurement is that if an angle $\theta$ is expressed in radians, the height of a point on the unit circle at this angle is $\sin(\theta)$ . Is it possible to choose a different unit of measurement for the angle so that we get something other than a sinusoid? Why doesn't the height of a point on the unit circle as a function of the angle give us a well-shaped half-circle on each half-period rather than a sinusoid?

It was written there that Archimedes tried to solve that process by applying pure geometry (using only compass and scale without its reading). But he failed to do that. However, there was no other method by which the angle can be trisected equally. However, out of curiosity, I wanted to solve the problem with some another process. It was also narrated in that text that $\angle BCF$ = $\phi$ = $\frac{\theta}{3}$ , when $CD$ will be equal to $r$ . And $C$ is to be a surmised point so that $CD$ can be equal to $r$ . But I wanted to calculate the specific location of $C$ from the circumferential point $I$ and measure the length of $IC$ (the diagram is given below) through mathematical term. My Attempt: At first I made a reverse approach by drawing $\angle BCF$ = $\phi$ = $\frac{\theta}{3}$ . Than, I drew two altitude line $BF$ and $DG$ , where $BF$ $\perp$ $CE$ and $DG$ $\perp$ $CA$ . And than, I connected $AD$ and $DI$ . From right angled $\triangle DGC$ , $GC$ = $r\cos\phi$ and $DG$ = $r\sin\phi$ , because $DC$ = $r$ . Again, we get an isosceles $\triangle ABD$ with having $AB$ = $AD$ = $r$ . From the $\triangle ABC$ , we get $180^\circ-\theta$ + $\frac{\theta}{3}$ + $\angle ABD$ = $180^\circ$ Than calucating the value, I got $\angle ABD$ = $\frac{2\theta}{3}$ and so, from isosceles $\triangle ABD$ , $\angle BAD$ = $180^\circ$ - $\frac{4\theta}{3}$ and from here we can write that $\angle DAI$ = $\frac{\theta}{3}$ . In $\triangle ADI$ , $AD$ = $r$ and $AI$ = $r$ . So, $\triangle ADI$ is an isosceles and $\angle DIA$ = $\frac{540-\theta}{6}$ . And now from right angled $\triangle DIG$ , we get $\frac{DG}{IG}$ = $\tan(\frac{540-\theta}{6}$ ) $\implies$ $IG$ = $\frac{r\sin\phi}{\tan(\frac{540-\theta}{6})}$ Subtracting | $IG$ | from | $CG$ |, $|IC|$ = $r\cos\phi$ - $\frac{r\sin\phi}{\tan(\frac{540-\theta}{6})}$ $\implies$ $|IC|$ = $r\cos(\frac{\theta}{3})$ - $\frac{r\sin(\frac{\theta}{3})}{\tan(\frac{540-\theta}{6})}$ Here we get the value of $IC$ , and so the point $C$ has an exact and individual location depending on the radius of the circle and the value of the $\theta$ . Is my formula\answer correct? If it so, then I would like to see another method except trigonometry.

For the ideal gas state, $$\left( \begin{array}{ccc} \color{blue}{\text{molecules}} &\color{blue}{ \gamma} & \color{blue}{a} \\  \text{monoatomic} & \frac{5}{3} & 2 \\  \text{diatomic} & \frac{7}{5} & \sqrt{6} \\  \text{triatomic} & \frac{9}{7} &  \sqrt{8} \\  \text{polyatomic} & \frac{4}{3} & \sqrt{7} \end{array} \right)$$ Fortunately, for $a=2$, we can recombine the arctangents making the equation  to be $$y=\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{x^3}{4+3x^2}\right)$$ the solution of which being  $$x=k \left(1+2 \cosh \left(\frac{1}{3} \cosh    ^{-1}\left(1+\frac{2}{k^2}\right)\right)\right)\qquad \text{where}\qquad k=\tan(y)$$ which is valid for any $y$. What is interesting to notice is that $x(k)$ is almost a linear function  which is far away to be the case for $x(y)$ as one could expect. For large values of $k$, corresponding to $y \to \frac \pi 2$, Taylor expansion gives $$x=3 k+\frac{4}{9 k}-\frac{32}{243 k^3}+O\left(\frac{1}{k^5}\right)$$ My problem is that I do not see how this could be used to generate an approximation for other values of $a$. Any idea will be more than welcome. Edit After @Mariusz Iwaniuk's comments, we could expand $y$ as a Taylor series for infinitely large values of $x$ and use series reversion. Using $\Delta=y_\infty-y$, we should end with $$x=\frac{a^2-1}{\Delta }-\frac{\left(a^2+1\right) }{3(a^2-1)}\Delta -\frac{\left(a^4+11    a^2+1\right) }{45 \left(a^2-1\right)^3}\Delta ^3+O\left(\Delta ^5\right)$$ which, numerically, seems to be quite good. Update Combining $$y_\infty=\frac \pi2 (a-1) \tag 2$$ $$y=a \tan^{-1} \left(\frac x a\right)-\tan^{-1} (x)\tag 3$$ $$\Delta=y_\infty-y=a \left(\frac \pi2-\tan^{-1} \left(\frac x a\right) \right) -\left( \frac \pi2-\tan^{-1} (x)\right)=a \tan^{-1} \left(\frac a x \right)-\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\tag 4$$ seems to be an easier approach for large $x$. Expanding as Taylor series $$\Delta=\sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^{k+1}\frac{ \left(a^{2 k}-1\right) }{(2 k-1)\,x^{2k-1}}$$ Using series reversion $$x=\frac{a^2-1}{\Delta }-\frac{\left(a^2+1\right) }{3( a^2-1)}\Delta -\frac{\left(a^4+11    a^2+1\right)}{45 \left(a^2-1\right)^3} \Delta ^3-\frac{2    \left(a^2+1\right) \left(a^4+56 a^2+1\right) }{945    \left(a^2-1\right)^5}\Delta ^5+O\left(\Delta ^{7}\right)$$ which makes $$\Delta-\left(a \tan^{-1} \left(\frac a x \right)-\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \right)=\frac{\left(a^8+247 a^6+723 a^4+247 a^2+1\right) }{4725    \left(a^2-1\right)^8}\Delta ^9+O\left(\Delta ^{11}\right)$$ For diatomic molecules, such as air, $(a=\sqrt 6)$, the coefficient is $\frac{11737}{263671875}\approx 4.5 \times 10^{-5}$. On the other side, for small $x$, we can build the simplest Padé approximant and get $$k=\frac{5 \left(a^2-1\right) x^3}{15a^2+9 \left(a^2+1\right) x^2}$$ leading to the cubic equation $$5\left( a^2-1\right) x^3-9  \left(a^2 +1\right)k\,x^2-15 a^2 k=0 $$ which can be solved using the hyperbolic method for one real root.

For the ideal gas state, $$\left( \begin{array}{ccc} \color{blue}{\text{molecules}} &\color{blue}{ \gamma} & \color{blue}{a} \\  \text{monoatomic} & \frac{5}{3} & 2 \\  \text{diatomic} & \frac{7}{5} & \sqrt{6} \\  \text{triatomic} & \frac{9}{7} &  \sqrt{8} \\  \text{polyatomic} & \frac{4}{3} & \sqrt{7} \end{array} \right)$$ Fortunately, for $a=2$, we can recombine the arctangents making the equation  to be $$y=\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{x^3}{4+3x^2}\right)$$ the solution of which being  $$x=k \left(1+2 \cosh \left(\frac{1}{3} \cosh    ^{-1}\left(1+\frac{2}{k^2}\right)\right)\right)\qquad \text{where}\qquad k=\tan(y)$$ which is valid for any $y$. What is interesting to notice is that $x(k)$ is almost a linear function  which is far away to be the case for $x(y)$ as one could expect. For large values of $k$, corresponding to $y \to \frac \pi 2$, Taylor expansion gives $$x=3 k+\frac{4}{9 k}-\frac{32}{243 k^3}+O\left(\frac{1}{k^5}\right)$$ My problem is that I do not see how this could be used to generate an approximation for other values of $a$. Any idea will be more than welcome. Edit After @Mariusz Iwaniuk's comments, we could expand $y$ as a Taylor series for infinitely large values of $x$ and use series reversion. Using $\Delta=y_\infty-y$, we should end with $$x=\frac{a^2-1}{\Delta }-\frac{\left(a^2+1\right) }{3(a^2-1)}\Delta -\frac{\left(a^4+11    a^2+1\right) }{45 \left(a^2-1\right)^3}\Delta ^3+O\left(\Delta ^5\right)$$ which, numerically, seems to be quite good. Update Combining $$y_\infty=\frac \pi2 (a-1) \tag 2$$ $$y=a \tan^{-1} \left(\frac x a\right)-\tan^{-1} (x)\tag 3$$ $$\Delta=y_\infty-y=a \left(\frac \pi2-\tan^{-1} \left(\frac x a\right) \right) -\left( \frac \pi2-\tan^{-1} (x)\right)=a \tan^{-1} \left(\frac a x \right)-\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\tag 4$$ seems to be an easier approach for large $x$.

So my question is, is there any way to show that $\frac{a - 2 + \sqrt3}{1 + 2a - \sqrt3a}$ is equal to $\frac{1 - a^2}{2a}$? If not, why are we getting two different answers?","If $\tan 35^\circ = a$, we are required to express $\left(\frac{\tan 145^\circ - \tan 125^\circ}{1 + \tan 145^\circ\tan 125^\circ}\right)$ in terms of $a$. Here's one way to solve this:  $$\frac{\tan 145^\circ - \tan 125^\circ}{1 + \tan 145^\circ\tan 125^\circ} = \tan (145^\circ - 125^\circ) = \tan 20^\circ = \tan (90^\circ - 70^\circ) = \cot 70^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan 70^\circ} = \frac{1}{\tan (2 \times 35^\circ)} = \frac{1 - \tan^2 35^\circ}{2\tan 35^\circ} = \frac{1 - a^2}{2a}$$ However, I tried to solve it using another method as described below, and faced a problem: $$\frac{\tan 145^\circ - \tan 125^\circ}{1 + \tan 145^\circ\tan 125^\circ} = \tan 20^\circ = \tan (35^\circ - 15^\circ) = \frac{\tan 35^\circ - \tan15^\circ}{1 + \tan 35^\circ\tan 15^\circ} = \frac{a - (2 - \sqrt3)}{1 + a(2 - \sqrt3)} = \frac{a - 2 + \sqrt3}{1 + 2a - \sqrt3a}$$ I tried to simplify it to get $\frac{1 - a^2}{2a}$, but I couldn't. So my question is, is there any way to show that $\frac{a - 2 + \sqrt3}{1 + 2a - \sqrt3a}$ is equal to $\frac{1 - a^2}{2a}$? If not, why are we getting two different answers?",,['trigonometry']
