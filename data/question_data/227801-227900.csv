0,Unique line in $\mathbb{P}^3$ through a point $p$ and intersecting two disjoint lines,Unique line in  through a point  and intersecting two disjoint lines,\mathbb{P}^3 p,"I'm a bit stuck with this exercise from a script I'm reading, and I'm not very familiar with projective $n$-space yet. The problem: Let $L_1$ and $L_2$ be two disjoint lines in $\mathbb{P}^3$, and let $p\in\mathbb{P}^3\smallsetminus(L_1\cup L_2)$. Show that there is a unique line $L\subseteq\mathbb{P}^3$ meeting $L_1$, $L_2$, and $p$ (i.e. such that $p\in L$ and $L\cap L_i\neq\varnothing$ for $i=1,2$). To be honest, I already have a problem with the term 'line'. As I take it, a line in $\mathbb{P}^3$ should be something cut out by two degree-1 polynomials (homogeneous, since it wouldn't be well defined otherwise, right?). But what are disjoint lines in projective space? As far as I understood it, two distinct lines should always intersect in exactly one point there, so how can they be disjoint? Can it be that these two statements mean a different kind of 'line'? Any explanation of this, hints, or even a solution would be very appreciated.

But since $s_0$ does not appear anywhere on the list, $T$ cannot contain $s_0$ . Therefore $T$ cannot be placed in one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers.

15,"Is ""The empty set is a subset of any set"" a convention?","Is ""The empty set is a subset of any set"" a convention?",,"Recently I learned that for any set A, we have $\varnothing\subset A$. I found some explanation of why it holds. $\varnothing\subset A$ means ""for every object $x$, if $x$ belongs to the empty set, then $x$ also belongs to the set A"". This is a vacuous truth, because the antecedent ($x$ belongs to the empty set) could never be true, so the conclusion always holds ($x$ also belongs to the set A). So $\varnothing\subset A$ holds.

The set of real numbers is defined to be the set of all Dedekind cuts, where a Dedekind cut is a pair of sets of rational numbers $\{L, R\}$ which have no elements in common, and where all the elements of $L$ are less than any element of $R$.  Each Dedekind cut is a real number. This is where I have a problem - surely that can’t be correct. The set $L$ is a set of all rationals, and there must be a rational in the set $L$ that is greater than all other rationals in that set, even if we have no method of determining it. And similarly, there must be a rational in the set $R$ that is less than all other rationals in that set, even if we have no method of determining it.

Second,  \begin{equation} (a,b) = \{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}=\{\{a,b\},\{a\}\} \end{equation} Sets don't preserve order, but ordered pairs do. How does the third part of the equality apply to the definition?

For example, Definition of an Ordered Pair Based on how my ignorant brain is viewing this, I don't see why the definition could not be. \begin{equation} (a,b)=\{\{a\},\{b\},\{a,b\}\} \end{equation} aka the power set. What is the significance of the {a} in that definition? Please keep things simple if possible. Normally definitions have a valid and clear reason for being defined that way. Clarification First, I understand what an ordered pair is. I just don't see how the set notation says that. Second,  \begin{equation} (a,b) = \{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}=\{\{a,b\},\{a\}\} \end{equation} Sets don't preserve order, but ordered pairs do. How does the third part of the equality apply to the definition? Third, another issue with the notation that I have starts with the Product Property of Sets \begin{equation} \text{Let $X$ and $Y$ be sets} :\ X=\{a,b,c\}\text{ and }Y=\{a,d,e\}. \end{equation} \begin{equation} \text{Then }X \times Y = \{(a,a),(a,d),(a,e),(b,a),(b,d),(b,e),\dots,(c,e)\} \end{equation} If we look at the first ordered pair and our given definition we have \begin{equation} (a,a)=\{\{a\},\{a,a\}\} \end{equation} How can this be so, you can't have duplicates in sets? I guess what I am looking for in an answer, is not a proof or a definition of ordered pairs, but rather something like, ""This notation says what it says because..."".

49,Is First Order Logic (FOL) the only fundamental logic?,Is First Order Logic (FOL) the only fundamental logic?,,"I'm far from being an expert in the field of mathematical logic, but I've been reading about the academic work invested in the foundations of mathematics, both in a historical and objective sense; and I learned that it all seems to reduce to a proper -axiomatic- formulation of set theory. It also seems that all set theories (even if those come in ontologically different flavours, such as the ones which pursue the "" iterative approach "" like ZFC, versus the "" stratified approach "" -inspired by Russell's and Whitehead's type theory first formulated in their Principia - such as Quine's NFU or Mendelson's ST) are built as collections of axioms expressed in a common language , which invariably involves an underlying first order predicate logic augmented with the set-membership binary relation symbol. From this follows that FOL makes up the ( necessary ) ""formal template"" in mathematics, at least from a foundational perspective. The justification of this very fact, is the reason behind this question. All the stuff I've read about the metalogical virtues of FOL and the properties of its ""extensions"" could be summarized as the statements below: FOL is complete ( Gödel, 1929 ), compact and sound, and all its particular formalizations as deductive systems are equivalent ( Lindström, 1969 ). That means that, given a (consistent) collection of axioms on top of a FOL deductive system, the set of all theorems which are syntactically provable, are semantically satisfied by a model of the axioms. The specification of the axioms absolutely entails all its consequences; and the fact that every first order deductive system is equivalent, suggests that FOL is a context-independent (i.e. objective), formal structure. On the other hand, the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem implies that FOL cannot categorically characterize infinite structures, and so every first order theory satisfied by a model of a particular infinite cardinality, is also satisfied by multiple additional models of every other infinite cardinality. This non-categoricity feature is explained to be caused by the lack of expressive power of FOL. The categoricity results that FOL-based theories cannot achieve, can be obtained in a Second Order Logic (SOL) framework. Examples abound in ordinary mathematics, such as the Least Upper Bound axiom, which allows the definition of the real number system up to isomorphism. Nevertheless, SOL fails to verify an analog to the completeness results of FOL, and so there is no general match between syntactic provability and semantic satisfiability (in other words, it doesn't admit a complete proof calculus). That means that, even if a chosen collection of axioms is able to categorically characterize an infinite mathematical structure, there is an infinite set of wff's satisfied by the unique model of the axioms which cannot be derived through deduction. The syntactic-semantic schism in SOL also implies that there is no such a thing as an equivalent formulation of potential deductive systems, as is the case in FOL and stated by Lindström's theorem. One of the results of this fact is that the domain over which second order variables range must be specified, otherwise being ill-defined. If the domain is allowed to be the full set of subsets of the domain of first order variables, the corresponding standard semantics involve the formal properties stated above (enough expressive power to establish categoricity results, and incompleteness of potential, non-equivalent deductive systems). On the other hand, through an appropriate definition of second order domains for second order variables to range over, the resultant logic exhibits nonstandard semantics (or Henkin semantics ) which can be shown to be equivalent to many-sorted FOL; and as single-sorted FOL, it verifies the same metalogical properties stated at the beginning (and of course, its lack of expressive power). The quantification extension over variables of successive superior orders can be formalized, or even eliminate the distinction between individual (first order) variables and predicates; in each case, is obtained -for every N- an Nth Order Logic (NOL), and Higher Order Logic (HOL), respectively. Nevertheless, it can be shown ( Hintikka, 1955 ) that any sentence in any logic over FOL with standard semantics to be equivalent (in an effective manner) to a sentence in full SOL, using many-sorting. All of this points to the fact that the fundamental distinction, in logical terms, lies between FOL (be it single-sorted or many-sorted) and SOL (with standard semantics ). Or what seems to be the case, the logical foundations of every mathematical theory must be either non-categorical or lack a complete proof calculus, with nothing in between that trade-off.

It also seems that all set theories (even if those come in ontologically different flavours, such as the ones which pursue the "" iterative approach "" like ZFC, versus the "" stratified approach "" -inspired by Russell's and Whitehead's type theory first formulated in their Principia - such as Quine's NFU or Mendelson's ST) are built as collections of axioms expressed in a common language , which invariably involves an underlying first order predicate logic augmented with the set-membership binary relation symbol. From this follows that FOL makes up the ( necessary ) ""formal template"" in mathematics, at least from a foundational perspective. The justification of this very fact, is the reason behind this question. All the stuff I've read about the metalogical virtues of FOL and the properties of its ""extensions"" could be summarized as the statements below: FOL is complete ( Gödel, 1929 ), compact and sound, and all its particular formalizations as deductive systems are equivalent ( Lindström, 1969 ). That means that, given a (consistent) collection of axioms on top of a FOL deductive system, the set of all theorems which are syntactically provable, are semantically satisfied by a model of the axioms. The specification of the axioms absolutely entails all its consequences; and the fact that every first order deductive system is equivalent, suggests that FOL is a context-independent (i.e. objective), formal structure. On the other hand, the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem implies that FOL cannot categorically characterize infinite structures, and so every first order theory satisfied by a model of a particular infinite cardinality, is also satisfied by multiple additional models of every other infinite cardinality. This non-categoricity feature is explained to be caused by the lack of expressive power of FOL. The categoricity results that FOL-based theories cannot achieve, can be obtained in a Second Order Logic (SOL) framework. Examples abound in ordinary mathematics, such as the Least Upper Bound axiom, which allows the definition of the real number system up to isomorphism. Nevertheless, SOL fails to verify an analog to the completeness results of FOL, and so there is no general match between syntactic provability and semantic satisfiability (in other words, it doesn't admit a complete proof calculus). That means that, even if a chosen collection of axioms is able to categorically characterize an infinite mathematical structure, there is an infinite set of wff's satisfied by the unique model of the axioms which cannot be derived through deduction. The syntactic-semantic schism in SOL also implies that there is no such a thing as an equivalent formulation of potential deductive systems, as is the case in FOL and stated by Lindström's theorem. One of the results of this fact is that the domain over which second order variables range must be specified, otherwise being ill-defined. If the domain is allowed to be the full set of subsets of the domain of first order variables, the corresponding standard semantics involve the formal properties stated above (enough expressive power to establish categoricity results, and incompleteness of potential, non-equivalent deductive systems). On the other hand, through an appropriate definition of second order domains for second order variables to range over, the resultant logic exhibits nonstandard semantics (or Henkin semantics ) which can be shown to be equivalent to many-sorted FOL; and as single-sorted FOL, it verifies the same metalogical properties stated at the beginning (and of course, its lack of expressive power). The quantification extension over variables of successive superior orders can be formalized, or even eliminate the distinction between individual (first order) variables and predicates; in each case, is obtained -for every N- an Nth Order Logic (NOL), and Higher Order Logic (HOL), respectively. Nevertheless, it can be shown ( Hintikka, 1955 ) that any sentence in any logic over FOL with standard semantics to be equivalent (in an effective manner) to a sentence in full SOL, using many-sorting. All of this points to the fact that the fundamental distinction, in logical terms, lies between FOL (be it single-sorted or many-sorted) and SOL (with standard semantics ). Or what seems to be the case, the logical foundations of every mathematical theory must be either non-categorical or lack a complete proof calculus, with nothing in between that trade-off. Why, so, is FOL invariably chosen as the underlying logic on top of which the set theoretical axioms are established, in any potentially foundational formalization of mathematics?

63,Why is Axiom of Choice required for the proof of countable union of countable sets is countable?,Why is Axiom of Choice required for the proof of countable union of countable sets is countable?,,"I know that this question has been asked a lot here, some of them are duplicate of each other. I’ve read every single of them, but my problem has not been resolved. I can just memorize that Axiom of Choice (AC) is needed, but I want to be clear of this, logically. Note : “Countable” here means infinitely countable. Recall the proof, it goes like this: First, I have countably many of countable sets. Let me enumerate them to $\langle A_i\rangle_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$. For each $i$, $A_i$ is countable. Since $A_i$ is countable for each $i$, there exists a bijection $h_i:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow A_i$ for each $i$. Then this is where Axiom of Choice (AC) comes into play. There are countably many $A_i$, so I have to choose ‘countably many’ times. Then I’ve got $h_i:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow A_i$ for each $i$ I want. But why is AC needed? What I understand about AC is, if I have a collection of non-empty sets, and I want to construct a new set by picking an element from each set in the collection, then AC allows me to pick them to ‘construct’ my new set. This is explicitly stated in its logical formula. For example, if I have a collection $\mathcal{A}=\lbrace A_i\rbrace_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ where $A_i$ is non-empty for each $i$ and I want to construct a new set $\lbrace a_i\rbrace_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ such that $a_i\in A_i$ for each $i$, then I need AC to guarantee that such set can be made. However, if my collection $\mathcal{A}=\lbrace A_i\rbrace_{i=0}^n$ is finite, then I can construct the new set without AC, i.e., it can be proved that such $\lbrace a_i\rbrace$ can be constructed without the need of AC. But what I don’t understand is, why am I not even permitted to just pick an element and manipulate them? Return to the same example, if I have a collection $\mathcal{A}=\lbrace A_i\rbrace_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ where $A_i$ is non-empty for each $i$, then I know that there exists $a_i\in A_i$ for each $i$. Am I permitted to manipulate $a_i$ for each $i$?, like constructing $\lbrace a_i\rbrace$ by the Axiom of Pair? Can I construct a set $A_i’:=A_i-\lbrace a_i\rbrace$ for each $i$? Each $a_i$ exists logically, and I want to put bracket around them like this $\lbrace a_i\rbrace$. This is allowed by the Axiom of Pair. Of course, I cannot make $\lbrace a_i\rbrace_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ since this is not implied by any axiom (even by the Axiom of Union or Axiom of Infinity) except AC. Most answer I found here is, I cannot even 'pick' an element from each set infinitely many times without AC (not to mention constructing a new set from them). Some people even said that each $A_i$ in the proof being countable does not mean that its enumeration is given. Well, in that case, can't I just say that since it does not have enumeration, then it's not countable and hence a contradiction to the assumption? An enumeration must exists. Some might say that it exists but is not given. Then what does 'given' mean in logic? Even in the proof that utilizes AC, we claim that a choice function exists, but not clearly stated 'which' choice function. We only know that it exists and use it to finish the proof. Why is this situation is different from knowing that each bijection $h_i$ exists for each $i$. Why are we permitted to manipulate existing choice function, but not allowed to manipulate existing bijection? Is this related to the fact that it is formulated in First-order logic?

However, if my collection $\mathcal{A}=\lbrace A_i\rbrace_{i=0}^n$ is finite, then I can construct the new set without AC, i.e., it can be proved that such $\lbrace a_i\rbrace$ can be constructed without the need of AC. But what I don’t understand is, why am I not even permitted to just pick an element and manipulate them? Return to the same example, if I have a collection $\mathcal{A}=\lbrace A_i\rbrace_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ where $A_i$ is non-empty for each $i$, then I know that there exists $a_i\in A_i$ for each $i$. Am I permitted to manipulate $a_i$ for each $i$?, like constructing $\lbrace a_i\rbrace$ by the Axiom of Pair? Can I construct a set $A_i’:=A_i-\lbrace a_i\rbrace$ for each $i$? Each $a_i$ exists logically, and I want to put bracket around them like this $\lbrace a_i\rbrace$. This is allowed by the Axiom of Pair. Of course, I cannot make $\lbrace a_i\rbrace_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ since this is not implied by any axiom (even by the Axiom of Union or Axiom of Infinity) except AC. Most answer I found here is, I cannot even 'pick' an element from each set infinitely many times without AC (not to mention constructing a new set from them). Some people even said that each $A_i$ in the proof being countable does not mean that its enumeration is given. Well, in that case, can't I just say that since it does not have enumeration, then it's not countable and hence a contradiction to the assumption? An enumeration must exists. Some might say that it exists but is not given. Then what does 'given' mean in logic? Even in the proof that utilizes AC, we claim that a choice function exists, but not clearly stated 'which' choice function. We only know that it exists and use it to finish the proof. Why is this situation is different from knowing that each bijection $h_i$ exists for each $i$. Why are we permitted to manipulate existing choice function, but not allowed to manipulate existing bijection? Is this related to the fact that it is formulated in First-order logic? Thank you!",,"['elementary-set-theory', 'axiom-of-choice']"

65,The cartesian product $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ is countable,The cartesian product  is countable,\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N},"I'm examining a proof I have read that claims to show that the Cartesian product $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ is countable, and as part of this proof, I am looking to show that the given map is surjective (indeed bijective), but I'm afraid that I can't see why this is the case. I wonder whether you might be able to point me in the right direction? Indeed, the proof begins like this: ""For each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, let $k_n, l_n$ be such that $n = 2^{k_n - 1} \left(2l_n - 1 \right)$; that is, $k_n - 1$ is the power of $2$ in the prime factorisation of $n$, and $2 l_n - 1$ is the (necessarily odd) number $\frac{n}{2^{k_n - 1}}$."" It then states that $n \mapsto \left(k_n , l_n \right)$ is a surjection from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$, and so ends the proof. I can intuitively see why this should be a bijection, I think, but I'm not sure how to make these feelings rigorous? I suppose I'd say that the map is surjective since given any $\left(k_n , l_n \right) \in \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ we can simply take $n$ indeed to be equal to $2^{k_n - 1} \left(2l_n - 1 \right)$ and note that $k_n - 1 \geq 0$ and thus $2^{k_n - 1}$  is both greater or equal to one so is a natural number (making the obvious inductive argument, noting that multiplication on $\mathbb{N}$ is closed), and similarly that $2 l_n - 1 \geq 2\cdot 1 - 1 = 1$ and is also a natural number, and thus the product of these two, $n$ must also be a natural number. Is it just as simple as this? I suppose my gut feeling in the proving that the map is injective would be to assume that $2^{k_n - 1} \left(2 l_n - 1 \right) = 2^{k_m - 1} \left(2 l_m - 1 \right)$ and then use the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic to conclude that $n = m$. Is this going along the right lines? The 'implicit' definition of the mapping has me a little confused about the approach. On a related, but separate note, I am indeed aware that if $K$ and $L$ are any countable sets, then so is $K \times L$, so trivially, taking the identity mapping we see trivially that this map is bijective and therefore that $\mathbb{N}$ is certainly countable (!), and thus so is $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$. Hence, it's not really the statement that I'm interested in, but rather the exciting excursion into number theory that the above alternative proof provides.","I'm examining a proof I have read that claims to show that the Cartesian product $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ is countable, and as part of this proof, I am looking to show that the given map is surjective (indeed bijective), but I'm afraid that I can't see why this is the case.

81,Are there more rational numbers than integers?,Are there more rational numbers than integers?,,"I've been told that there are precisely the same number of rationals as there are of integers. The set of rationals is countably infinite, therefore every rational can be associated with a positive integer, therefore there are the same number of rationals as integers. I've ignored sign-related issues, but these are easily handled. To count the rationals, consider sets of rationals where the denominator and numerator are positive and sum to some constant. If the constant is 2 there's 1/1. If the constant is 3, there's 1/2 and 2/1. If the constant is 4 there's 1/3, 2/2 and 3/1. So far we have counted out 6 rationals, and if we continue long enough, we will eventually count to any specific rational you care to mention. The trouble is, I find this very hard to accept. I have two reasons. First, this logic seems to assume that infinity is a finite number. You can count to and number any rational, but you cannot number all rationals. You can't even count all positive integers. Infinity is code for ""no matter how far you count, you have never counted enough"". If it were possible to count to infinity, it would be possible to count one step less and stop at count infinity-1 which must be different to infinity. The second reason is that it's very easy to construct alternative mappings. Between zero and one there are infinitely many rational numbers, between one and two there are infinitely many rational numbers, and so on. To me, this seems a much more reasonable approach, implying that there are infinite rational numbers for every integer. But even then, this is just one of many alternative ways to map between ranges of rationals and ranges of integers. Since you can count the rationals, you can equally count stepping by any amount for each rational. You can use 1..10 for the first rational and 11..20 for the second etc. Or 1..100 and 101..200 etc, or 1..1000 and 1001..2000 etc. You can map finite range of integers of any size to each rational this way and, since there is no finite upper bound to the stepping amount, you could argue there are potentially infinite integers for every single rational. So... can anyone convince me that there is a single unambiguous correct answer to this question? Are there more rational numbers than integers, or not? EDIT Although I've already accepted an answer, I'll just add some extra context. My reason for questioning this relates to the Hilbert space-filling curve. I find this interesting because of applications to multi-dimensional indexing data structures in software. However, I found Hilberts claim that the Hilbert curve literally filled a multi-dimensional space hard to accept. As mentioned in a comment below, a one meter line segment and a two meter line segment can both be seen as sets of points and, but (by the logic in answers below), those two sets are both the same size (cardinality). Yet we would not claim the two line segments are both the same size. The lengths are finite and different. Going beyond this, we most certainly wouldn't claim that the size of any finite straight line segment is equal to the size of a one-meter-by-one-meter square. The Hilbert curve reasoning makes sense now - the set of points in the curve is equal to the set of points in the space it fills. Previously, I was thinking too much about basic geometry, and couldn't accept the size of a curve as being equal to the size of a space. However, this isn't based on a fallacious counting-to-infinity argument - it's a necessary consequence of an alternative line of reasoning. The two constructs are equal because they both represent the same set of points. The area/volume/etc of the curve follows from that.","I've been told that there are precisely the same number of rationals as there are of integers.

95,Definition of the Infinite Cartesian Product,Definition of the Infinite Cartesian Product,,"(1) If $X$ and $Y$ are two sets, we define the Cartesian product $X \times Y$ as the set of ordered pairs $(x,y)$, such that $x \in X$ and $y \in Y$. (2) On the other hand [Folland, Real Analysis, page 4], if $\{X_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in A}$ is infinite indexed family of sets, their Cartesian product $$ \prod_{\alpha \in A}X_\alpha $$ is defined as the set of maps $f: A \to \bigcup\limits_{\alpha \in A} X_\alpha$ such that $f(\alpha) \in X_\alpha$ for every $\alpha \in A$. After saying this, Folland remarks: it should be noted, and promptly forgotten, that when $A = \{1,2\}$, the previous definition  of $X_1 \times X_2$ [that's (1) above] is set-theoretically different from the present definition of $\prod_1^2 X_j$ [that's (2) above]. Indeed, the latter concept depends on the mappings, which are defined in terms of the former one. I am not grasping this remark. Specifically, here are my questions. Question 1 : How is (2) set-theoretically different from (1)? A simple illustrative example? Question 2 : If (1) is extended to infinite families, which definition would be stronger?

99,Covering the Euclidean plane with constructible lines and circles,Covering the Euclidean plane with constructible lines and circles,,"It is a well-known fact that the set of points which are finitely constructible with straightedge and compass (starting with two points $0$ and $1$) doesn't cover the Euclidean plane $\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{R}$ because only $\mathbb{Q}^{\sqrt{}}\times \mathbb{Q}^{\sqrt{}}$ is finitely constructible (which is a countable set). [Side question 1: What is the official name (and symbol) for the set which I call $\mathbb{Q}^{\sqrt{}}$, i.e. the set of those numbers that can be defined by addition, substraction, multiplication, division and taking the square root alone (starting from $0$ and $1$). Note that the set of algebraic numbers $\mathbb{Q}^\text{alg}$ allows for taking arbitrary roots.] But in the process of constructing points with straightedge and compass a lot of other points are ""created"", just by drawing the allowed lines and circles that are needed to take intersections (allowed = defined by previously constructed points). Only those points count as constructed that are intersections of such constructed lines and circles with other constructed lines and circles. But the other ones at least have been drawn . My question is: Does it make sense to ask – and how can it be proved or disproved – whether   $\mathbb{R}^2$ might be ""finitely coverable"" in the sense that for any   given point $p \in \mathbb{R}^2$ there is a line or circle   constructible in finitely many steps (starting from points $[0,0]$ and $[1,0]$) which $p$ lies on? The question and answer is not trivial at first glance (at least not for me), because the number of constructed points grows so incredibly fast, and the number of constructed lines and circles grows even faster (roughly quadratically, because each pair of new points gives – roughly – one new line and two new circles). [Side question 2: Can a rough estimate of the growth rate of the numbers of points, lines and circles be given, when starting with $n$ points in general or regular position?] To give a little visual sugar to my question: These are the constructible points, lines and circles after only three steps (starting with two points $0$ (red) and $1$ (orange)).
