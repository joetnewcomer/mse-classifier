0,Equilateral triangle separating two homothetic circles,Equilateral triangle separating two homothetic circles,,"This question is a follow-on of a question asked today that has been erased by its author an hour after being asked, for unknown reasons. I found it interesting ; I have a solution, mainly based on analytic geometry. I would appreciate to see other solutions (using synthetic geometry for example), hopefuly less computational. Let me reformulate it in a slightly different way compared to the original question : Given : a fixed line with two points $B$ and $C$ on it. Let us construct $A$ such that $ABC$ is equilateral . Let us take an arbitrary point $F$ on line $BC$ outside line segment $[BC]$ . Let us denote by $D$ , resp. $E$ , the center of the incircle of triangle $FAC$ , resp. the center of the excircle of triangle $FAB$ opposed to $F$ . Prove that $$BE+CD=BC\tag{1}.$$ Solution : Let us define $A'$ as being the symmetrical point of $A$ with respect to line $BC$ . $A',C,D$ are aligned. Indeed, slope(A'C)=slope(C'D) for the following reason : as $\angle ACF = 180°-60°=120°$ , we have $\angle DCF=\angle DCA=\angle ACB = 60°$ . For a similar reason, $A',B,E$ are aligned. Let us call $D',E'$ the projections of $D,E$ resp. on line $AB$ ; (1) amounts to say that : $$BE'+CD'=\tfrac12 BC\tag{2}.$$ Let us take coordinate axes such that : $$B(-1,0),C(1,0),A(0,\sqrt{3}),F(a,0) \ \text{with} \ a>1$$ as one can see on the figure. Let $2 \alpha = \angle AFB$ . We have $$\tan(2 \alpha)=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{a}$$ Using relationship $$\tan(2 \alpha)=\frac{2 t}{1-t^2} \ with \ t:=\tan(\alpha)\tag{3}$$ we get : $$t:=\tan(\alpha)=\frac{\sqrt{3+a^2}-a}{\sqrt{3}}$$ (but in fact, we will not use this relationship). Point $D$ being at the intersection of : $$\begin{cases}\text{Line FD : } & y=-t(x-a)\\ \text{Line A'C : }  & y=\sqrt{3}(x-1)\end{cases}$$ its abscissa, which is the same as the abscissa of $D'$ , is $$x_{D'}=\frac{at+\sqrt{3}}{t+\sqrt{3}}$$ For a similar reason : $$x_{E'}=\frac{at+\sqrt{3}}{t-\sqrt{3}}$$ (2) will be established if we show that : $$\left(-1-\frac{at+\sqrt{3}}{t-\sqrt{3}}\right)+\left(\frac{at+\sqrt{3}}{t+\sqrt{3}}-1\right)=1\tag{4}$$ With some simplifications, the LHS of (4) becomes : $$(at+\sqrt{3})\frac{-2 \sqrt{3}}{t^2-3}-2\tag{5}$$ But, using (3), $$t^2-1=\frac{-2ta}{\sqrt{3}}\tag{6}$$ Plugging (6) into (5) gives this LHS equal to $1$ as awaited. Edit : I hadn't understood at first the track followed by the asker of the initial question, based on the sine law ; it can be completed by checking that for all $\theta$ : $$\frac{\sin(\theta)}{\sin(2\pi/3-\theta)}+\frac{\sin(\pi/3-\theta)}{\sin(\pi/3+\theta)}=1.$$","This question is a follow-on of a question asked today that has been erased by its author an hour after being asked, for unknown reasons.

11,Can someone answer my question about geometry triangles,Can someone answer my question about geometry triangles,,"I saw on a children's maths program in early 1980; I think it was Johnny Ball presenting. He drew an obtuse triangle (or I think it was obtuse). Then he put a dot anywhere in the triangle and drew three lines through the dot from each point of the triangle to the other end. He then drew a smaller triangle within the original by joining points created on the sides of the original triangle. Before I state the problem I will try to make my explanation clearer. The dot is placed anywhere inside the obtuse triangle and a line is drawn from each of the three vertices, through the dot to the other end of the triangle. Another smaller triangle is created by drawing three lines from the points (points of intersection of the lines and the sides) on the sides of the larger triangle. Then what Mr Ball did was to find where he could project outwards from the larger triangle and the inner triangle so that the lines met, when you find the projections for all three sides of both triangles that meet, these points create a perfectly straight line. Is there a name for this triangle projection and is there a practical use for this or is it just a fun thing to learn? I have always thought this fascinating. My maths knowledge is limited but I am always inspired by the extent of human ingenuity.","I saw on a children's maths program in early 1980; I think it was Johnny Ball presenting. He drew an obtuse triangle (or I think it was obtuse). Then he put a dot anywhere in the triangle and drew three lines through the dot from each point of the triangle to the other end. He then drew a smaller triangle within the original by joining points created on the sides of the original triangle. Before I state the problem I will try to make my explanation clearer. The dot is placed anywhere inside the obtuse triangle and a line is drawn from each of the three vertices, through the dot to the other end of the triangle. Another smaller triangle is created by drawing three lines from the points (points of intersection of the lines and the sides) on the sides of the larger triangle. Then what Mr Ball did was to find where he could project outwards from the larger triangle and the inner triangle so that the lines met, when you find the projections for all three sides of both triangles that meet, these points create a perfectly straight line.

After many attempts, I came up with this: let $ABC$ be the triangle where $CH$ is the altitude, $CM$ is the median, and name the angles $ACH = MCB = \theta$, $CAH = \alpha$, $CBM = \beta$ and $HCM = \gamma$. Using the sine theorem in the triangle $CMB$ we get $$\frac{MB}{\sin(\theta)} = \frac{MC}{\sin(\beta)},$$ while using the sine theorem in the triangle $ACM$ we get $$\frac{MC}{\sin(\alpha)} = \frac{MA}{\sin(\theta + \gamma)}.$$ Combining these equations I found $$\sin(\alpha) \sin(\theta) = \sin(\beta) \sin(\theta + \gamma).$$ Applying the identity $$\sin(a)\sin(b) = \frac{\cos(a-b) - \cos(a+b)}{2}$$ I concluded $$\cos(\alpha - \theta) = \cos(\theta + \gamma - \beta).$$ Since all angles are within $[0, \pi]$ range I concluded $$\alpha - \theta = \theta + \gamma - \beta,$$ thus $2 \theta + \gamma = \alpha + \beta$.

With only the 100 feet of fencing you got from your neighbor, what are the dimensions of the playpen? This problem can be solved using simple algebra. Pretend that the width of the playpen is perpendicular to the house, and the length is parallel. Give variables to each: $x$ for the width, and $y$ for the length. You have the two equations $2x+y=100$ and $x\cdot y=A$ where $A$ is the area of the pen. Solving for $y$ in the first equation, you get $y=100-2x$. Substituting $y$ into the second equation gives you $(100-2x)\cdot x=A$ To find the maximum value, we can first find the two x-intercepts: $(0,0)$ and $(50,0)$. The average of the x-values gives you the x-value of the vertex, which is $25$. Plugging this into the first equation, you get $y=50$. So there you have it. The width of the playpen is 25, and the length is 50 for a maximum area of $25\cdot 50=1250$. But this wasn't my real question.

If the initial configuration is such that $P$ is at $(a,0)$, find parametric equations for the curve traced by $P$, using angle $t$ from the positive $x$-axis to the center $B$ of the moving circle. The resulting curve is called a hypocycloid . The following is the solution from  the text. The center of the moving circle is at $(a-b)$$(\cos(t),\sin(t))$. Notice that as the moving circle rolls so that its center moves counterclockwise it is turning clockwise relative to its center. When the small circle has traveled completely around the large circle it has rolled over a length of $2\pi(a)$. Its circumference is $2\pi b$ so if it were rolling along a straight line it would have revolved $a/b$ times. So far I understand the story. However, The problem is that it is rolling around in a circle and so it has lost a rotation each time the center has traveled completely around. In other words the smaller wheel is turning at a rate of $((a/b)-1)t$$=$$(a-b)t/b$. I don't understand the preceding sentences. Why does it mean that it loses a rotation each time the center has traveled completely around and why is that so? Also, I don't see how this brings the final equation. Moreover, how is the rate of the smaller wheel turning translated as the angle of $P$? The position of $P$ relative to the center of the moving circle is $$b(\cos(-\frac{(a-b)t}{b}),\sin(-\frac{(a-b)t}{b}))=b(\cos(\frac{(a-b)t}{b}),-\sin(\frac{(a-b)t}{b}))$$. Also, why is the rate multiplied my $-$, the negative sign, in this equation? On the other hand, now suppose that the small circle rolls on the outside of the larger circle.

Now take the square root: $p\sqrt{k^2+1}=c$. Again, since $p$ and $c$ are integers, $\sqrt{k^2+1}$ must then also be an integer, so $k^2+1$ must be a perfect square. However, we just showed that $k$ is itself a perfect square, and there are no two perfect squares $u$ and $v$ such that $u-v=1$. What did I do wrong here?

68,"Cutting a polygon into 2 or 3 smaller, rationally-scaled copies of itself?","Cutting a polygon into 2 or 3 smaller, rationally-scaled copies of itself?",,"I've noticed that many 2D geometric figures can be tiled using four smaller copies of themselves. For example, here's how to subdivide a rectangle, equilateral triangle, and right triomino into four smaller copies: Each smaller figure here is scaled down by a factor of $\frac{1}{2}$ in width and height, dropping its area by a factor of four, which is why there are four smaller figures in each. You can also tile some 2D figures with nine smaller copies, each $\frac{1}{3}$ of the original size, or sixteen smaller copies, each $\frac{1}{4}$ of the original size, as shown here: By mixing and matching sizes, we can get other numbers of figures in the subdivisions. For example, here's a $2 \times 1$ rectangle subdivided into five rectangles of the same aspect ratio, an equilateral triangle subdivided into eleven equilateral triangles, and a right triomino tiled by thirty-eight right triominoes: $2 \times 1$ rectangle subdivided into five rectangles of the same aspect ratio, an equilateral triangle subdivided into eleven equilateral triangles, and a right triomino tiled by thirty-eight right triominoes"" /> I've been looking for a shape that can tile itself with exactly two or three smaller copies. I know this is possible if we allow the smaller copies to be scaled down by arbitrary amounts, but I haven't been able to find a shape that can tile itself with two or three copies of itself when those smaller copies are scaled down by rational amounts (e.g. by a factor of $\frac{1}{2}$ or $\frac{3}{5}$ ). My Question My question is the following: Is there a 2D polygon that can be tiled with two or three smaller copies of itself such that each smaller copy's dimensions are a rational multiple of the original size? If we drop the restriction about the smaller figures having their dimensions scaled by a rational multiple, we can do this pretty easily. For example, a rectangle of aspect ratio $\sqrt{2} : 1$ can tile itself with two smaller copies, and a rectangle of aspect ratio $\sqrt{3} : 1$ can tile itself with three smaller copies: $\sqrt{2}:1$ rectangle cut into two self-similar copies, and a $\sqrt{3}:1$ rectangle cut into three self-similar copies"" /> However, in these figures, the two smaller copies are scaled down by a factor of $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ and $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$ , respectively, which aren't rational numbers. If we move away from classical polygons and allow for fractals, then we can do this with a Sierpinski triangle, which can be tiled by three smaller copies of itself. However, it's a fractal, not a polygon. What I've Tried If we scale down a 2D figure by a factor of $\frac{a}{b}$ , then its area drops to a $\frac{a^2}{b^2}$ fraction of its original area. This led me to explore writing $1$ as a sum of squares of rational numbers, such as $1 = \frac{4}{9} + \frac{4}{9} + \frac{1}{9}$ or $1 = \frac{9}{25} + \frac{16}{25}$ . This gives several possible values for how to scale down the smaller copies of the polygon, but doesn't give a strategy for choosing the shapes of the reduced-size polygon to get the smaller pieces to perfectly tile it. I've looked into other problems like squaring the square and other similar tiling problems. However, none of the figures I've found so far allow for a figure to be tiled with two or three copies of itself. I've also tried drawing a bunch of figures on paper and seeing what happens, but none of them are panning out. Is this even possible in the first place?

97,A specific example regarding the inscribed square problem,A specific example regarding the inscribed square problem,,"Toeplitz' conjecture (also called inscribed square problem) says that: For every Jordan curve $\mathscr C$, there exists four distincts points $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$ belonging to $\mathscr C$ such that $ABCD$ is a square. A Jordan curve is a non self-intersecting continuous loop. Here is a drawing to illustrate the situation, and a link to the Wikipedia page if you want to find out more about this conjecture. The conjecture has already been proven in several cases, including when $\mathscr C$ is piecewise analytic. So we know that for these two figures, there exists an inscribed square. The question is how do I find those squares?","Toeplitz' conjecture (also called inscribed square problem) says that: For every Jordan curve $\mathscr C$, there exists four distincts points $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$ belonging to $\mathscr C$ such that $ABCD$ is a square.

99,Two tangent circles inscribed in a rectangle (Compute the area),Two tangent circles inscribed in a rectangle (Compute the area),,"Consider two circles with a diameter equal to $a$, externally tangent to each other, and whose centers are at the same height. Those circles are inscribed inside a rectangle of length $2a$ and height $a$. This is a sketch I made for this problem (please, forgive my unsteady handwriting): I am asked to calculate the shaded area. I can do it using: Symmetry. This is the easiest way in my opinion, since we know the area of each circle ($\pi a^2/4$) and the area of the rectangle ($2a^2$), which gives us: $\boxed{A_{\text{shaded}}=\dfrac{4-\pi}{4} a^2}$ Mathematical functions. We can set the origin at the bottom left corner, calculate each of the circles' analytical functions (as well as that of the line), compute the intersections, and make use of definite integrals to compute the final area. It will yield the exact same result as the above, yet the process to achieve it would be much longer. However, I'm not interested in any of these 2 methods (as they look pretty easy). I'm interested in finding a pure geometrical way to solve it. No functions. No symmetry as I used above. But pure geometric relationships. I thought about drawing some lines from the center of each circle to each intersection, like this: This would give us 4 areas hopefully easy to solve for ($S_1$, $S_1^{\prime\prime}$ and $S_2$, $S_2^{\prime\prime}$). Of course, $S_1=S_1^{\prime\prime}$ and $S_2=S_2^{\prime\prime}$ but as I said, I don't want to make use of symmetry (I'm a bit masochistic after all). So I thought about this solving scheme: $A_{\text{shaded}}=\frac12A_{\text{rectangle}}-S_2-(A_{\text{circle}}-S_2^{\prime\prime})$ $A_{\text{sector}}=S_1+S_2$ Since $S_1$ is a triangle, we could use some trigonometric relations in it to solve for $S_1$, and since the area of a circular sector is known, we could solve for $S_2$ (and $S_2^{\prime\prime}$, and very innocently find that actually $S_2=S_2^{\prime\prime}$) The main problem I have is that I don't know the inner angle of the circle sectors, because of the (seemingly randomly placed) intersection points near the borders of the rectangle. IF ONLY I were able to locate those intersection points using pure trigonometry and geometric relationships/theorems, the problem could be solved. Any hints or ideas? PD: Please, don't question my (foolish) decision of not making use of symmetry. I want to take this problem as a personal challenge. Obviously, if this were to be solved quickly I wouldn't scratch my head too much and go for the easy solution.","Consider two circles with a diameter equal to $a$, externally tangent to each other, and whose centers are at the same height.
