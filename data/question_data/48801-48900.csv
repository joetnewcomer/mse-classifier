0,Differentiation under the integral sign.,Differentiation under the integral sign.,,"I'm working through an integral suggested for practice at the end of the Wikipedia article on differentiation under the integral sign, and I'm stuck. I am attempting to evaluate this integral: $$\int_0^{\pi/2} \frac{x}{\tan x} \ dx.$$ The article suggests the following parameterization: $$F(a)=\int_0^{\pi/2} \frac{\tan^{-1}(a\tan (x))}{\tan x} \ dx.$$ Differentiating with respect to $a$, we get $$F'(a)=\int_0^{\pi/2} \frac{1}{1+a^2\tan^2 x} \ dx.$$ I can't find a way to evaluate this, and neither can Wolfram Alpha. The special values $a=0,1$ are easy, but I fail to see how they help. How can I finish evaluating this integral? Edit: I think it's just substitution, maybe. I'll update the post accordingly soon. Edit 2: Indeed, the substitution $u=\tan x$ and identity $\sec^2 = 1 + \tan^2$ transform the above integral into $$F'(a) = \int_0^{\pi/2} \frac{1}{(1+u^2)(1+a^2u^2)}.$$ This can be solved with partial fractions.","I'm working through an integral suggested for practice at the end of the Wikipedia article on differentiation under the integral sign, and I'm stuck.

I have used a similar technique to that used on this question: Reduction formula for $I_{n, k} = \int x^k \left({x^2 + A x + B}\right)^n \ \mathrm d x$ as follows. Let $h$ be the real function defined as: $$\forall x \in \mathbb R: h (x) = x^2 + A x + B$$ Thus we have: $$I_n (a, b) := \int \dfrac {a x + b} {(h (x))^n} \mathrm d x$$ Then, in order to get the suggestive coefficients in the answer given above, we do: $$\dfrac {\mathrm d} {\mathrm d x} \left({\dfrac {a x + b} {(h (x))^{n - 1} } }\right) = (a x + b) \dfrac {-(n - 1)} {(h (x))^n} (2 x + A) + \dfrac a {(h (x))^{n - 1} }$$ using the product rule, chain rule and power rules for diffing.

So far, I've been able to prove $(1)$ . The proof is very simple and uses transformation $t\mapsto1-t$ in the integral. The identity follows immediately after simplification. This prompted me to try to prove the other two identities using substitutions in the integral $(\star)$ At this point, I have been able to rewrite $(2)$ as $$\,_2F_1\left(2a,2a-c+1;c;z\right)=(1+z)^{-2a}\,_2F_1\left(a,a+\tfrac12;c;\tfrac{4z}{(z+1)^2}\right)$$ via the substitution $\tfrac{z}{2-z}\mapsto z$ .This rewritten form looks very similar to $(3)$ , suggesting that they are related.

This seems related, as clearly $$_2F_1(a,b;c;z)=\frac{\Gamma(c)}{\Gamma(b)\Gamma(c-b)}U(0,b-1,c-b-1,-a;z).$$ For example, the substitution $t\mapsto \tfrac{1-t}{1+t}$ gives the identity $$U(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta;z)=2^{1+\alpha+\gamma}(1-z)^{-\delta}U\left(-\alpha-\beta-\gamma-\delta-2,\gamma,\beta,\delta;\frac{z+1}{z-1}\right).$$ And while setting $\alpha=\beta+\gamma+\delta+2=0$ yields $$\,_2F_1(-\delta,\beta+1;\beta+\gamma+2;z)=2^{\gamma+1}(1-z)^{-\delta}\,_2F_1\left(-\delta,\gamma+1;\beta+\gamma+2;\frac{z+1}{z-1}\right),$$ this is not one of the transformation identities I was trying to prove.

First let us consider the following Generating Functions: $$\sum_{r=0}^{\infty}\binom{2r}{r}^2\frac{H_r}{2^{4r}}k^{2r}=K'(k)+\frac{2K(k)}{\pi}\ln\left(\frac{k}{4k'}\right)$$ $$\sum_{r=0}^{\infty}\binom{2r}{r}^2\frac{H_{2r}}{2^{4r}}k^{2r}=\frac{K'(k)}{2}+\frac{2K(k)}{\pi}\ln\left(\frac{\sqrt{k}}{2k'}\right)$$ Now one may let $k\to k\sin t$ and Integrate from $0$ to $\pi/2$ with respect to $t$ . $$\sum_{r=0}^{\infty}\binom{2r}{r}^3\left(\frac{H_r}{2^{6r}}\right)(2kk')^{2r}=\frac{4K(k)K'(k)}{3\pi}+\frac{8K^2(k)}{3\pi^2}\ln(kk'/4)-\frac{2v(2kk')}{\pi^2}$$ $$\sum_{r=0}^{\infty}\binom{2r}{r}^3\left(\frac{H_{2r}}{2^{6r}}\right)(2kk')^{2r}=\frac{2K(k)K'(k)}{3\pi}+\frac{4K^2(k)}{3\pi^2}\ln(kk'/4)-\frac{2v(2kk')}{\pi^2}$$ where, $$v(k)=\int_{0}^{\pi/2}K(k\sin t)\ln(1-k^{2}\sin^{2}t)dt$$ What's troublesome here is the function $v(k)$ , I am not able reduce it further. At the very least we can find the Generating Function for $H_{n}-H_{2n}=\overline{H}_{2n}$ which is the Skew Harmonic Number (As the Function $v(k)$ cancels out). $$\pi\sum_{r=0}^{\infty}\binom{2r}{r}^3\left(\frac{\overline{H}_{2r}}{2^{6r}}\right)(2kk')^{2r}=\frac{2}{3}K(k)K'(k)+\frac{4}{3\pi}\ln(kk'/4)K^2(k)$$ Now we differentiate here and write everything in Terms of $k_n$ , $\alpha_n,\beta_n$ .

57,The role of constant of integration,The role of constant of integration,,"Let us consider the following integral $$\int \frac{\sin x}{\cos^3 x}dx\, .$$ If we note that $\tan x= \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}$ , we have $$\int \frac{\tan x}{\cos^2 x}dx = \frac{\tan^2 x}{2}+C \quad (1)$$ since $\int f(x) f^\prime (x) dx= \frac{f^2(x)}{2}+C$ and $f(x)=\tan x$ . Otherwise, if we substitute $t=\cos x$ : $$-\int\frac{dt}{t^3}=\frac{1}{2\cos^2 x}+C \quad (2) .$$ The result shall be the same, but $\frac{\tan^2 x}{2}\neq \frac{1}{2\cos^2 x}$ .

76,Why we Use Partitions of Unity. Specific Questions,Why we Use Partitions of Unity. Specific Questions,,"While trying to better understand why we use partitions of unity I stumbled across this post . There are a few points I do not understand: This is exactly how to compute integrals in practice. But if we use it as our definition in theory, it becomes messy Why exactly does it become messy? The definition pointed at in the post seems to be the following: Let $\{(U_i,\phi_i)\}$ be an atlas for $S$ up to a null set consisting of disjoint charts. We define the integral of $\omega$ over $M$ as $$\int_S\omega := \sum_i\int_{U_i}\omega|_{U_i} := \sum_i\int_{V_i} (\phi_i^{-1})^*\omega|_{U_i}$$ where, for the integrands in the sum to be well-defined, we need the guarantee that $(\phi_i^{-1})^*\omega|_{U_i}$ is compactly supported in some rectangle $V_i\supseteq\phi_i(U_i)$ . $(\phi_i^{-1})^*\omega|_{U_i} = f\ dx^1\wedge dx^2$ for some bounded function $f$ . Is there anything else we would need to make this definition proper? If I understand the author of the post correctly, each of the atlases he suggests for the unit sphere has their own issues. What exactly are these? As far as I can tell these are: Spherical coordinates: as $\phi(S) = \mathbb{R}^2$ , our pullback form fails to be compactly supported. However, could we not 'patch' our previous definition so as to include a limit process as follows: $$\int_{U_i}\omega|_{U_i} := \lim_{r\to\infty}\int_{B(r)}(\phi^{-1})^*\omega|_{\phi^{-1}(B(r))}\ ?$$ where $B(r)$ is, say, the box $[-r,r]^2$ . I've seen similar ideas used to attribute a value to integrals such as $$\int_0^1\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}dx := \int_{(0,1)}\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}dx$$ as opposed to, although possible, to define them in terms of partitions of unity.

84,Making a Dirac Delta expression rigorous (measure theory),Making a Dirac Delta expression rigorous (measure theory),,"I have been trying to make an expression in terms of a ``Dirac Delta function'' rigorous, but I failed miserably. Please help, if you can. References are welcome. The motivation for this comes from calculating densities $\rho$ in a measure space $M$ , if one is given `samples' $\alpha(\omega)$ indexed by $\omega$ in another measure space $\Omega$ . This has applications in statistical physics, so perhaps people have done this already. For starters, if $\left(\Omega, \mathcal A \right)$ is a measurable space and $\omega \in \Omega$ , then the Dirac measure is $$ \delta_\omega \colon \,  \mathcal A \mapsto \mathbb R \, , \quad A \to \delta_\omega\left(A \right) :=   \begin{cases} 1 \, , \, \omega \in A \\ 0 \, , \,\omega \notin A \end{cases} \, . $$ I believe that the problem at hand requires this concept, and not the Dirac distribution. Now let $(M,\mathcal A, \mu)$ , $(\Omega,\mathcal B, \nu)$ be $\sigma$ -finite measure spaces and let $\alpha \colon \Omega \to \mathcal M$ be a measurable function. Then I want that for any $\theta \in M$ and any sequence of measurable sets $\left(N_n (\theta)\right)_{n \in \mathbb N}$ containing $\theta$ , having finite measure and with $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \mu \left(N_n (\theta)\right) = 0$$ that $$\theta \mapsto \rho \left( \theta \right) =  \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\nu \left( \alpha^{-1} \left(N_n (\theta)\right)\right)}{\mu \left(N_n (\theta)\right)}$$ is well-defined and measurable. This is where the Dirac measure comes in: I'm quite sure that for another (arbitrary?) sequence $\left( A_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb N}$ of  measurable sets in $\Omega$ with finite measure and with $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \nu \left( A_n^C \cap \Omega \right) = 0$$ (i.e. ` $A_n$ converges to $\Omega$ in measure') that $$\rho \left( \theta\right) \overset{!}{=} \lim_{n \to \infty}  \frac{\int_{A_n} d \nu \negthinspace \left( \omega\right) \, \, \delta\left( \theta - \alpha_{\omega}\right)}{\nu \left( A_n\right)}$$ The problem is 1) to turn this into a mathematically sensible expression in terms of the Dirac measure, and 2) to show equality with the above one. Note that neither $M$ nor $\Omega$ can be assumed to be finite measure spaces. EDIT: Alright, let me clarify things a bit. 1) The above description is a formalization of the following problem: Say I decided to place an uncountable number of points in $M= \mathbb{R}^n$ , but I decided to label them in a rather inconvenient manner. So for each label $\omega \in \Omega$ I have a point $\alpha_\omega \in M$ . Now the problem is that, say, suddenly I don't care about the labels any more, but rather I want to know how these points are distributed in space with respect to some volume measure (e.g. the Lebesgue measure $\mu$ ). That is, I want a density.  So I want to integrate over my label space (each label has equal weight, so I have a measure $\nu$ on it) and only count those points in which I'm evaluating the density at. The above expressions are what I came up with. 2) The last equation is purely symbolic. The point is to ""count"" only those points in $\Omega$ for which $\theta = \alpha_\omega$ . So it's not really useful to consider it as the Dirac delta of a function. The sequence of sets is only there, because $\nu(\Omega)$ may be infinite. 3) Yes, the first ""definition"" is probably problematic. For instance, what if all $\alpha_\omega$ are equal?

Every $Y\in\Omega_n^+$ can be diagonalized as $Y=U\gamma U^t$ for a unique $\gamma\in\Gamma_n$ and some orthogonal $U\in O_n(\mathbb{R})$. Further, $U$ is unique up to right multiplication by a matrix of the form $diag(\pm 1,\dots,\pm 1)$ (of which we have exactly $2^n$ choices). By changing variables, I ideally want to express my original integral $I$ (using the hypothesis $F(BAB^t)=F(A)$)as   $$I=\int_{\Omega_n^+}F(Y)dY=\int_{O_n(\mathbb{R})/diag(\pm 1,\dots,\pm 1)}\int_{\Gamma_n}F(\gamma)|J(\gamma,U)|dU d\gamma$$   where $J(\gamma,U)$ is the Jacobian determinant. What are the correct measures $dU$ and $d\gamma$? I think that $d\gamma=d\lambda_1\cdots d\lambda_n$, while I have no idea about $dU$. I have read on a paper that $J(\gamma,U)$ turns out to depend only on $\gamma$ (no explanation why), in which case I can further simplify    $$I=\int_{O_n(\mathbb{R})/diag(\pm 1,\dots,\pm 1)}dU \cdot \int_{\Gamma_n}F(\gamma)|J(\gamma)|d\gamma$$   Is this correct? In this case, is the first integral convergent?",,"['integration', 'matrices']"

I tried various substitutions, but I'm not sure if this is the right approach. Perhaps, it is necessary to use dominated convergence theorem or something of that sort? Thanks for any help.",,"['integration', 'measure-theory', 'derivatives']"
