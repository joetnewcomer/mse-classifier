0,Computing the Grothendieck group of a polynomial ring (over a field) or affine n-space as a scheme?,Computing the Grothendieck group of a polynomial ring (over a field) or affine n-space as a scheme?,,"So this question arose from my attempt to do exercises II.6.10 and III.5.4, both from Hartshorne's algebraic geometry. I have almost finished, but am not quite sure how to make the last implication. My situation is as follows: I have a short exact sequence $$ 0 \longrightarrow \mathbb{Z}^{r-1} \longrightarrow K \longrightarrow K' \longrightarrow 0. $$ where $K$ is the Grothendieck group of coherent sheaves on $\mathbb{P}_{k}^{r}$ and $K$ is the Grothendieck group of coherent sheaves on $\mathbb{A}^{r}$. I want to show that $K \simeq \mathbb{Z}^{r}$. By induction, I have that the Grothendieck group for $\mathbb{P}^{r-1}$ is $\mathbb{Z}^{r-1}$. So my task is reduced to showing that the Grothendieck group for $\mathbb{A}^{r}$ is just $\mathbb{Z}$. This is apparently a fairly standard problem. Stated another way, I was to find the Grothendieck group of finitely-generated modules on $R=k[x_{1}, \ldots , x_{r}]$. The approach I had planned to take was the following: Let $M$ be a finitely-generated module over $R$. Then we have a finite free resolution, $$ 0 \longrightarrow F_{k} \longrightarrow F_{k-1} \longrightarrow \cdots \longrightarrow F_{1} \longrightarrow F_{0} = M \longrightarrow 0 $$ Let $[M]$ denote the equivalence class of $M$ in the Grothendieck group. By this equivalence relation, we have  $$ [M] = \sum_{i=1}^{k}(-1)^{i+1}[F_{i}] $$ Since each $F_{i}$ is free, and the Grothendieck group respects direct sums, we have that $$ [M] = \sum_{j} n_{j}[R] $$ Also define $$ \epsilon([M]) = \sum_{j}n_{j}. $$ I will call this value the resolvent trace (for lack of a better term). Then if $K(R)$ is the Grothendieck group for $R$, we have a map, $$ K(R) \longrightarrow \mathbb{Z} $$ defined by $$ M \longmapsto \epsilon([M]). $$ My question is about well-definedness. Why is this process well-defined? In particular, surely a different choice of finite free resolution of $M$ would yield a different value of $\epsilon([M])$? Potential remedy to the problem: Since $R$ is regular, it has a well-defined projective dimension being the length of any minimal projective resolution. Moreover by Quillen-Suslin, any such resolution must be free. So I can always choose my free resolution to be minimal of the same length, in this case $r$. But this still doesn't allow me to conclude that what I've called the ""resolvent trace"" will be the same. The well-definedness in terms of respecting the equivalence relation defining the Grothendieck group should come from the Horseshoe Lemma, if I can resolve the above problem. Does this sound correct?

My question is: Let $f\colon X\to Y$ be a morphism between the varieties $X$ and $Y$. Let $Z:= \overline{f(X)}$ be the closure of $f(X)$ in $Y$. Then, why $f\colon X\to Z$ is  morphism according to my definitions above? I know $f\colon X\to Z$ is continuous. Then, i have to show that $Z$ is also a variety. I have distinguished two cases (i know that the image of an irreducible space by a continuous function is also irreducible, and that the closure of an irreducible subset is also irreducible): If $Y$ is affine variety, then $Z$ is an affine variety. If $Z$ is projective variety, than $Z$ is also projective vaeriety If $Y$ is quasi affine, then let $W$ be the affine variety of wich $Y$ is an open subset. Then the closure of $Z$ in $W$ is affine variety, and $Z$ is open in the closure of $Z$ in $W$, so $Z$ is quasi affine. The same if $Y$ is quasi projective. My problem is to show the condition for every open subset $V$ of $Z$, $$f^*\colon O_Z(V)\to O_X(f^{-1}(V))$$ is well- defined, i.e. $g\circ f$ is in  $O_X(f^{-1}(V))$ for every $g$ in $O_Z(V)$, knowing that this is true for the open subset of $Y$, i.e. for every open subset $V$ of $Y$, $$f^*\colon O_Y(V)\to O_X(f^{-1}(V))$$ is well- defined, i.e. $g\circ f$ is in  $O_X(f^{-1}(V))$ for every $g$ in $O_Y(V)$. So, what am I missing? I'm struggling on this. EDIT 26/11/2017 My strategy was: take an open subset $V$ of $Z$ and a regular function $g\colon V\to K \in O_Z(V)$. Then, $V=Z\cap V'$ where $V'$ is an open subset of $Y$. I want to find a regular function $g':V' \to K\in O_Y(V')$ such that $g'_{|f(f^{-1}(V))}=g$. If I do that, then $g'\circ f$ is in $O_X(f^{-1}(V'))$, so $(g'\circ f)_{|f^{-1}(V)}$ is in $O_X(f^{-1}(V))$, so $g\circ f=(g'\circ f)_{|f^{-1}(V)}$ is in $O_X(f^{-1}(V))$ Q.E.D. So the question is : how can I find a regular function $g':V' \to K\in O_Y(V')$ such that $g'_{|f(f^{-1}(V))}=g$? EDIT 26/11/2017, n°2 Another idea was to try with a ""local approach"". Take an open subset $V$ of $Z$ and a regular function $g\colon V\to K \in O_Z(V)$. I want to show that $(g\circ f)\colon f^{-1}(V)\to K$ is in $O_X(f^{-1}(V))$. Let $y$ be in $f^{-1}(V)$. I want to show that $g\circ f$ is a quotient of polynomials (or a quotient of homogeneous polynomials of the same degree if $X$ is a (quasi) projective variety) in an open neighborhood of $y$. So $f(y)\in V$. But $g$ is regular in $f(y)$, so there exists an open subset $W$ of $V$ with $f(y)\in W$, and exist $h,k$ ""polynomials"" such that $k\ne 0 $ in $W$ and $$g_{|W}=\frac{h}{k}_{|W}$$ But then $f^{-1}(W)$ is open in $X$ and $y \in f^{-1}(W)$ and we have that $$(g\circ f)_{|f^{-1}(W)}=\frac{h\circ f}{k \circ f}_{|f^{-1}(W)}$$ The problem is that now I don't know if $h,k$ are regular functions on $Y$, i.e. elements of $O_Y(Y)$ (for example if $Y$ is a projective variety, than $h$ and $k$ are  homogeneous polynomials of the same degree, but they don't define regular functions, not even functions). In other words , I want to say that $h\circ f$ and $k \circ f$ are regular functions on $X$ (or, on an open subset $U$ of $X$ containing $y$), such that they are both quotient of polynomials and so $g\circ f$ is quotient of polynomials in an open neighborhood of $y$, but I don't know how to say that .","For me, an affine variety is an irreducible closed subset of some $A_k^n$.

Finally, if $X$ and $Y$ are varieties , $f\colon X\to Y$ is a morphism of varieties if $f$ is continuous and for every open subset $V$ of $Y$, $$f^*\colon O_Y(V)\to O_X(f^{-1}(V))$$ is well- defined, i.e. $g\circ f$ is in  $O_X(f^{-1}(V))$ for every $g$ in $O_Y(V)$. My question is: Let $f\colon X\to Y$ be a morphism between the varieties $X$ and $Y$. Let $Z:= \overline{f(X)}$ be the closure of $f(X)$ in $Y$. Then, why $f\colon X\to Z$ is  morphism according to my definitions above? I know $f\colon X\to Z$ is continuous. Then, i have to show that $Z$ is also a variety. I have distinguished two cases (i know that the image of an irreducible space by a continuous function is also irreducible, and that the closure of an irreducible subset is also irreducible): If $Y$ is affine variety, then $Z$ is an affine variety. If $Z$ is projective variety, than $Z$ is also projective vaeriety If $Y$ is quasi affine, then let $W$ be the affine variety of wich $Y$ is an open subset. Then the closure of $Z$ in $W$ is affine variety, and $Z$ is open in the closure of $Z$ in $W$, so $Z$ is quasi affine. The same if $Y$ is quasi projective. My problem is to show the condition for every open subset $V$ of $Z$, $$f^*\colon O_Z(V)\to O_X(f^{-1}(V))$$ is well- defined, i.e. $g\circ f$ is in  $O_X(f^{-1}(V))$ for every $g$ in $O_Z(V)$, knowing that this is true for the open subset of $Y$, i.e. for every open subset $V$ of $Y$, $$f^*\colon O_Y(V)\to O_X(f^{-1}(V))$$ is well- defined, i.e. $g\circ f$ is in  $O_X(f^{-1}(V))$ for every $g$ in $O_Y(V)$. So, what am I missing? I'm struggling on this. EDIT 26/11/2017 My strategy was: take an open subset $V$ of $Z$ and a regular function $g\colon V\to K \in O_Z(V)$. Then, $V=Z\cap V'$ where $V'$ is an open subset of $Y$. I want to find a regular function $g':V' \to K\in O_Y(V')$ such that $g'_{|f(f^{-1}(V))}=g$. If I do that, then $g'\circ f$ is in $O_X(f^{-1}(V'))$, so $(g'\circ f)_{|f^{-1}(V)}$ is in $O_X(f^{-1}(V))$, so $g\circ f=(g'\circ f)_{|f^{-1}(V)}$ is in $O_X(f^{-1}(V))$ Q.E.D. So the question is : how can I find a regular function $g':V' \to K\in O_Y(V')$ such that $g'_{|f(f^{-1}(V))}=g$? EDIT 26/11/2017, n°2 Another idea was to try with a ""local approach"". Take an open subset $V$ of $Z$ and a regular function $g\colon V\to K \in O_Z(V)$. I want to show that $(g\circ f)\colon f^{-1}(V)\to K$ is in $O_X(f^{-1}(V))$. Let $y$ be in $f^{-1}(V)$. I want to show that $g\circ f$ is a quotient of polynomials (or a quotient of homogeneous polynomials of the same degree if $X$ is a (quasi) projective variety) in an open neighborhood of $y$. So $f(y)\in V$. But $g$ is regular in $f(y)$, so there exists an open subset $W$ of $V$ with $f(y)\in W$, and exist $h,k$ ""polynomials"" such that $k\ne 0 $ in $W$ and $$g_{|W}=\frac{h}{k}_{|W}$$ But then $f^{-1}(W)$ is open in $X$ and $y \in f^{-1}(W)$ and we have that $$(g\circ f)_{|f^{-1}(W)}=\frac{h\circ f}{k \circ f}_{|f^{-1}(W)}$$ The problem is that now I don't know if $h,k$ are regular functions on $Y$, i.e. elements of $O_Y(Y)$ (for example if $Y$ is a projective variety, than $h$ and $k$ are  homogeneous polynomials of the same degree, but they don't define regular functions, not even functions). In other words , I want to say that $h\circ f$ and $k \circ f$ are regular functions on $X$ (or, on an open subset $U$ of $X$ containing $y$), such that they are both quotient of polynomials and so $g\circ f$ is quotient of polynomials in an open neighborhood of $y$, but I don't know how to say that .",,"['abstract-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra']"

66,Help proving that an finite morphism of schemes is a closed map,Help proving that an finite morphism of schemes is a closed map,,"I am trying to prove that a finite morphism $f: X \longrightarrow Y$ of schemes is a closed map. That is, that the image of a closed set is closed in $Y$. I am a little unsure about the proof that I have, and I am very new to this stuff so am prone to missing subtleties. I would really appreciate if anyone could glance through what I have and see if my argument is valid. One thing I am a particularly curious about is in the second last paragraph. Do I need to specifically choose the ideal $\mathcal{I}$ to give $Z$ the reduced subscheme structure or not? The following is my attempt at a proof: We will first show the following lemma: Let $f: \text{Spec }  A \longrightarrow \text{Spec }  B$ be a finite morphism of affine schemes corresponding to a morphism $\phi: B \longrightarrow A$ of rings. Then $f(\text{Spec } A)$ is closed in $\text{Spec } B$. To show this, first note that if $f$ is a finite morphism, then $\phi$ is a finite morphism of rings. This implies that $\phi: B \longrightarrow A$ is integral. That is, that $A$ is an integral extension of $\phi(B)$. We have the surjective morphism $$ \pi: B \longrightarrow B / \ker\phi $$ from which we get a morphism of schemes  $$ \iota: \text{Spec }  (B / \ker \phi) \longrightarrow \text{Spec } B $$ which is a homeomorphism onto a closed subset of $\text{Spec }  B$. The morphism $f: \text{Spec }  B \longrightarrow \text{Spec }  A$ factors as $$ \text{Spec }  A \stackrel{\tilde{\phi}^{*}}{\longrightarrow} \text{Spec }  (B / \ker \phi) \stackrel{\iota}{\longrightarrow} \text{Spec }  B. $$ So to show that $f(\text{Spec }  A)$ is closed in $\text{Spec } B$, we need only show that $\tilde{\phi}^{*}$ is surjective. But $\tilde{\phi}^{*}$ is induced by the injective morphism of rings $$ \tilde{\phi}: B / \ker(\phi) \longrightarrow A, $$ which corresponds to an integral extension $B / \ker(\phi) \subseteq A$. Surjectivity then follows by the Going-Up Theorem. We will now show that $f: \text{Spec }  A \longrightarrow \text{Spec } B$ is a closed map. Let $Z \subseteq \text{Spec } A$ be any closed subset of $\text{Spec }  A$ corresponding to an ideal $\mathcal{I} \subseteq A$ so that $Z = \text{Spec }  (A / \mathcal{I})$. But since $A$ is finite over $B$ via $\phi$, we also have $A / \mathcal{I}$ is finite over $B$. Then by the above result, we have that $f(\text{Spec }  (A /\mathcal{I}))$ is closed in $\text{Spec }  B$. Finally, for the general case of a finite morphism $f: X \longrightarrow Y$ of schemes, we use the fact that $Z \subset X$ is closed precisely if it is closed in the induced topology of any affine open in $X$. Similarly, $f(Z)$ is closed in $Y$ precisely if it is closed in the induced topology of any affine in $Y$. The result then follows from the above on affines.","I am trying to prove that a finite morphism $f: X \longrightarrow Y$ of schemes is a closed map. That is, that the image of a closed set is closed in $Y$. I am a little unsure about the proof that I have, and I am very new to this stuff so am prone to missing subtleties. I would really appreciate if anyone could glance through what I have and see if my argument is valid. One thing I am a particularly curious about is in the second last paragraph. Do I need to specifically choose the ideal $\mathcal{I}$ to give $Z$ the reduced subscheme structure or not? The following is my attempt at a proof: We will first show the following lemma: Let $f: \text{Spec }  A \longrightarrow \text{Spec }  B$ be a finite morphism of affine schemes corresponding to a morphism $\phi: B \longrightarrow A$ of rings. Then $f(\text{Spec } A)$ is closed in $\text{Spec } B$. To show this, first note that if $f$ is a finite morphism, then $\phi$ is a finite morphism of rings. This implies that $\phi: B \longrightarrow A$ is integral. That is, that $A$ is an integral extension of $\phi(B)$. We have the surjective morphism $$ \pi: B \longrightarrow B / \ker\phi $$ from which we get a morphism of schemes  $$ \iota: \text{Spec }  (B / \ker \phi) \longrightarrow \text{Spec } B $$ which is a homeomorphism onto a closed subset of $\text{Spec }  B$. The morphism $f: \text{Spec }  B \longrightarrow \text{Spec }  A$ factors as $$ \text{Spec }  A \stackrel{\tilde{\phi}^{*}}{\longrightarrow} \text{Spec }  (B / \ker \phi) \stackrel{\iota}{\longrightarrow} \text{Spec }  B. $$ So to show that $f(\text{Spec }  A)$ is closed in $\text{Spec } B$, we need only show that $\tilde{\phi}^{*}$ is surjective. But $\tilde{\phi}^{*}$ is induced by the injective morphism of rings $$ \tilde{\phi}: B / \ker(\phi) \longrightarrow A, $$ which corresponds to an integral extension $B / \ker(\phi) \subseteq A$. Surjectivity then follows by the Going-Up Theorem. We will now show that $f: \text{Spec }  A \longrightarrow \text{Spec } B$ is a closed map. Let $Z \subseteq \text{Spec } A$ be any closed subset of $\text{Spec }  A$ corresponding to an ideal $\mathcal{I} \subseteq A$ so that $Z = \text{Spec }  (A / \mathcal{I})$. But since $A$ is finite over $B$ via $\phi$, we also have $A / \mathcal{I}$ is finite over $B$. Then by the above result, we have that $f(\text{Spec }  (A /\mathcal{I}))$ is closed in $\text{Spec }  B$. Finally, for the general case of a finite morphism $f: X \longrightarrow Y$ of schemes, we use the fact that $Z \subset X$ is closed precisely if it is closed in the induced topology of any affine open in $X$. Similarly, $f(Z)$ is closed in $Y$ precisely if it is closed in the induced topology of any affine in $Y$.

Using this function I defined the matrix $\varPhi$ by  $\varPhi_{i,j}:=\phi(\mathcal O(i),\mathcal O(j))$. How can I proceed from here that the $\mathcal O(i)$ actually generate the Grothendieck group? Sincerely, slinshady Edit: Maybe I should say that I only consider locally free $\mathcal O_{\mathbb P^n}$ -modules, as this is sufficient in sufficiently nice settings.",,"['algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-k-theory']"

97,Computing isogenous curves,Computing isogenous curves,,"Let $E_1$ and $E_2$ be elliptic curves defined over a field $\mathbb{K}$. An isogeny is a finite morphism $$\varphi:E_1\to E_2$$ such that $\varphi(\mathcal{O})=\mathcal{O}$. It is possible to show that an isogeny induces a morphisms of the groups of $E_1$ and $E_2$. It is clear that isogeny is an equivalence relation. Furthermore, following Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometry exercise 4.9.b, for a fixed elliptic curve $E$, the set elliptic curves of isogenous to $E$ is countable. We are looking for a way to compute explicitly this set of isogenous curves for a fixed curve $E$. Our ultimate goal would be to give a set of curves $\lbrace E_i\rbrace_{i\in I}$ such that if $\varphi: E\to E'$ is an isogeny, then there exists $i\in I$ with $E_i\simeq E'$, each $E_i$ being expressed explicitely in the Weirstrass form (assuming $\mathrm{car}(\mathbb{K})\neq 2,3$).

For example, proposition 4.12 tells us: "" For an elliptic curve $E$ and $\Phi$ a finite subgroup of $E$, there is a unique elliptic curve $E'$ and a separable isogeny $\varphi:E\to E'$ such that $\ker \varphi=\Phi$.

If anything is unclear, please let me know. Edit : Thanks to @Jyrki Lahtonen for pointing out this trivial case.
