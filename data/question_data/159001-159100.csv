2,Prime divisors of $a^n+b$.,Prime divisors of .,a^n+b,"Let $a,b\in \mathbb N$ , $a>1$ . Prove that the set $M=\{\omega(a^n+b)\mid n\in \mathbb N\}$ is infinite, where $\omega(n)$ is the number of distinct pime divisors of $n$ . First, obviously we have to prove that $P=\{p\in \mathbb P:\exists n\in \mathbb N \text{ s.t. } p\mid a^n+b\}$ is infinite, but since the set of prime divisors of $a^n$ is finite, we have by Kobayashi that $P$ is infinite (If somebody knows how to prove this without Kobayashi feel free to post the proof). So I only managed to solve the case $(a,b)=1$ . Here's the proof, Fist denote $f(n)=a^n+b$ . Assume $M$ is finite and take $m=\max M$ then there would be some $n$ such that $$f(n)=a^n+b=\prod_{i=1}^m{p_i^{c_i}}$$ Consider the number $m=n+\prod\phi(p_i^{c_i+1})$ , by Fermat we have $\forall 1\le i\le m$ , $$f(m)\equiv a^n+b\equiv f(n)\pmod{p_i^{c_i+1}}$$ So $p_i^{c_i+1}\mid f(m)\iff p_i^{c_i+1}\mid f(n)$ this is enough to imply $$\nu_{p_i}(f(m))=\nu_{p_i}(f(n))$$ But $f(m)>f(n)$ so there must be some $p\ne p_i$ such that $p\mid f(m)$ contradicting the maximality of $m$ . There are two main problems when $(a,b)>1$ , the first is you can't directly use Fermat's Theorem and the second is how do you ensure that $\nu_p(f(m))=\nu_p(f(n))$ for $p\mid (a,b)$ ?

4,A polynomial with unique root in every $ \mathbb Z _ n $,A polynomial with unique root in every, \mathbb Z _ n ,"Let $ p ( x ) \in \mathbb N [ x ] $ be a polynomial with nonnegative integer coefficients, and $ a \in \mathbb Z $ be a given integer constant. If for all positive integers $ n $ , $ p ( x ) + a $ has a unique root in the finite ring $ \mathbb Z _ n $ , can we conclude that $ p ( x ) $ must be linear? This problem comes from another one that I'm working on, and can be considered as an special case weaker than the original problem. While working, I realized that I have no method for solving this special case either, and I need to become sure that it holds, first. The intuition behind why I think $ p ( x ) $ must be linear comes from Schur's conjecture (it is now a theorem in fact, yet still widely referred to by this name). If instead of having a unique root, $ p ( x ) + a $ were supposed to be a permutation polynomial , then by the conjecture it should have been the composition of linear functions and Dickson polynomials (of the first kind). But since all the coefficients of $ p ( x ) $ are nonnegative, and Dickson polynomials have a certain pattern of alternating signs in coefficients, it seems that $ p ( x ) $ must be linear (I haven't checked this in full detail, but it seems to be true). That made me more confident in believing that the nonnegativity of the coefficients of $ p ( x ) $ might be a strong enough condition to add to the weaker assumption of $ p ( x ) + a $ having a unique root, to get the same result. Also note that while the assumption of Schur's conjecture is that the polynomial is a permutation polynomial in the finite field $ \mathbb Z _ p $ for infinitely many prime numbers $ p $ , here we have the unique root property in $ \mathbb Z _ n $ for all positive integers $ n $ , which seems to be a very strong restriction. The above mentioned theory of permutation polynomials was the closest theory to my problem in the literature that I could find searching online. I couldn't find much information on polynomials having unique roots when considered over several finite fields or rings. This may come from my unfamiliarity with the subject, of course.

The claim is that given a primitive set $S$ such that $P(S)$ is finite, then $S$ is finite. The thing is that I could only give a proof for this if $P(S)=2$ , I'll put my proof below (it isn't really elegant or anything though), but I couldn't generalize it for bigger cases (not even if $P(S)=3$ ); so I'd really appreciate if someone notices how to generalize it, or if you have a proof for bigger cases. My proof: The idea is to suppose that $S\subset \mathbb N$ is an infinite set such that $P(S)$ has two elements, and prove that $S$ can't be a primitive set. Let $P(S)=\{p,q\}$ , then we can describe $S$ as follows $S=\{p^\alpha q^\beta:\;(\alpha,\beta)\in I\}$ for some $I\subset \mathbb N^2$ (notice that there is a trivial one-to-one correspondence between $S$ and $I$ , so I might use alternatingly $p^\alpha q^\beta$ and $(\alpha, \beta)$ ). Let $\alpha_0=\min\{\alpha\in \mathbb N/\;\exists \beta\in \mathbb N:\;(\alpha,\beta)\in S\}$ , and $\beta_0$ be such that $(\alpha_0,\beta_0)\in S$ , and consider $S'=S\setminus\{(\alpha_0, \beta_0)\}$ . Now, given $(\alpha,\beta)\in S'$ ,  if $\beta\geq \beta_0$ , the problem is finished since we know that $\alpha\geq \alpha_0$ , and then we'd have that $p^{\alpha_0}q^{\beta_0}\mid p^\alpha q^\beta$ , and then $S$ isn't primitive; so, by way of contradiction let us assume that for all $(\alpha, \beta)\in S'$ we have that $\beta<\beta_0$ .

Let's assume that there is an $N\in \mathbb N$ such that the statement isn't true, then, given $(\alpha, \beta)\in S'$ we have that $\alpha_0\leq\alpha\leq N$ and $0\leq \beta<\beta_0$ , and this implies that $\#S'\leq (N+1)\beta_0$ , which is absurd since the set is infinite, so the lemma is true. Going back to what we are trying to prove, let $\beta_1=\min\{\beta\in\mathbb N/\;\exists\alpha:\;(\alpha, \beta)\in S'\}$ and let $\alpha_1$ be such that $(\alpha_1,\beta_1)\in S$ . Then by the lemma there exists $\alpha>\alpha_1$ and $\beta\in\mathbb N$ such that $(\alpha,\beta)\in S'$ . Lastly, as $\alpha>\alpha_1$ and $\beta\geq \beta_1$ we have that $p^{\alpha_1}q^{\beta_1}\mid p^\alpha q^\beta$ , which proves that $S'$ isn't primitive, and therefore $S$ neither.","After watching Numberphile´s video with Jared Litchman about primitive sets I started playing around with this notion (in case you didn't see it: a set is a primitive set if no number in the set divides another one) and I thought about the following statement that I believed to be true: Given a set let (with the set of prime numbers).

Suppose that two adjacent numbers can simultaneously be at least $2$ , and at least one of them is strictly greater than $2$ .

The case is considered similarly when two adjacent numbers can simultaneously be no more than $2$ , and at least one of them is strictly less than $2$ . Thus, the numbers ""alternate"": no less than two and no more than two. Suppose WLOG that $a_{1}+a_{2} \geq 4$ .

How was the consequence obtained that the sums of all pairs are equal to $4$ ?","positive numbers are written in a circle. The sum of any two neighbors is equal to the square of the number following them clockwise. Find all such sets of numbers. Let us introduce the notation , not forgetting that is even. Let the numbers start in clockwise order . The sum of the conditions of the problem gives . Suppose that two adjacent numbers can simultaneously be at least , and at least one of them is strictly greater than . Then all subsequent numbers in the circle are strictly greater than , which contradicts the obtained equality. The case is considered similarly when two adjacent numbers can simultaneously be no more than , and at least one of them is strictly less than . Thus, the numbers ""alternate"": no less than two and no more than two. Suppose WLOG that . Then Adding all the inequalities, we get the inequality . Therefore, So all numbers are equal to two.

This is because $$\alpha=\frac{n+\sqrt{n^2-4}}{2}\implies\alpha^{-1}=2\cdot\frac{n-\sqrt{n^2-4}}{n^2-(n^2-4)}=\frac{n-\sqrt{n^2-4}}2,$$ so $\alpha,\alpha^{-1}$ are conjugate.
