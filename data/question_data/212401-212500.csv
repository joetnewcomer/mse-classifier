94,Prove that $11^{16} + 16^{11} \equiv 0 \mod {17}$,Prove that,11^{16} + 16^{11} \equiv 0 \mod {17},"I was checking the following Fermat's theorem exercise: Prove that $11^{16} + 16^{11} \equiv 0 \mod {17}$ Because both $11$ and $16$ are primes with $17$ I applied the theorem individually, so the first one $$11^{16}\equiv 1 \mod {17}$$ gives me a result directly. But the after applying the theorem to the second one $$16^{16} \equiv 1 \mod {17}$$ I don't know the way to go back in the power from $16$ to $11$ which is the number requested. Is that as easy as $16 \equiv -1 \mod {17}$ ? Any help will be really appreciated.","I was checking the following Fermat's theorem exercise: Prove that Because both and are primes with I applied the theorem individually, so the first one gives me a result directly.
