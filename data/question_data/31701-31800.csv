The question is simple.  You have $n$ balls and $m$ bins.  Each ball has an equal probability of landing in any bin.  I want to know what the probability that exactly $1$ bin is empty. My answer seems simple enough, but I don't think it's sufficient.  It is $(\frac{m-1}{m})^n$ since for each ball, it can go in any of the other bins.

1,How can the probability that a number contains the digit 3 be 1?,How can the probability that a number contains the digit 3 be 1?,,"Based on this Numberphile video which claims almost all integers contain a $3$, I have a few questions on the reasoning behind recurring decimal numbers like $0.9999\ldots =1$ What they have shown is that $$\lim_{n \to + \infty} \frac{10^n-9^n}{10^n} = 1$$ this basically means that probability of eg. a $3$ occurring in a set of numbers like for $1-10, 1-100,$ increases as the upper bound gets large. So you are more likely to see a $3$ when you take $1-100000$, than $1-10$ as the probability gets higher. So what I would like to know is as '$n$' approaches $∞$ does probability of seeing a '$3$' equals $0.99999....$? But since $0.9999... = 1$ wouldn't this not make sense, since there are infinitely many numbers that do not have a '$3$'? All I need is for an explanation as to why this logic is wrong. Simpler answers are most appreciated.

My question arises from the answer to this question .  Consider a Markov chain with state space $\{1,2,3,\dots\}.$ If the chain is is state $1,$ it transitions to state $j$ with probability $p_j.$ If it is in state $j>1$ then it always transitions to state $j-1$ .  The chain is irreducible and aperiodic, so it has a unique stationary distribution.  The sum $(1)$ arises in computing the stationary probabilities, so it must converge. I've been trying unsuccessfully to find a more direct proof.  There isn't any way to apply standard tests (root test, ratio test, Gauss's test) and I haven't any other ideas.  (It's equivalent to the statement that if N is a random variable that takes positive integer values, then $E(N)$ exists, but I don't see how that helps.

I tried to use the following idea: Let's write down the events: A = lock opened by the first key B = lock opened by the second key C = lock opened by the third key Then we have probabilities: We have 1 good and 4 bad keys (5 total): P(A) = 1/5 = 0.2 Then we have the probability 4/5 that we take the wrong key. Now we have 1 good and 3 bad keys (4 total): P(B) = 4/5 * 1/4 = 1/5 = 0.2 Then we have the probability 3/4 that we take the wrong key. Now we have 1 good and 2 bad keys (3 total): P(C) = 4/5 * 3/4 * 1/3 = 1/5 = 0.2 This way we can sum it up and get a probability is 0.6. I fear that my solution is poor and unfounded, and I ask for help to valid and improve it. You can also show your solution with your thought",,['probability']

My answer is $\frac49$ (but it's not even in the alternatives), since the probability of getting a squared side is $P(S)=2P(T)$, and I can either get a squared or a triangular one, then the probability of getting a squared side is: $$\frac{2\cdot P(T)}{3\cdot P(T)}=\frac23$$ The solution that is proved to me is $\frac9{25}$, but it doesn't even make sense to me, because that implies that the probability of getting a squared size is $\frac35$.
