0,Set of singular points of a normal variety.,Set of singular points of a normal variety.,,"In my algebraic geometry course these result appeared: If X is a normal variety, then the set of singular points $S$ have codimension $\geq 2$ . (Here normal means that $\mathcal{O}_x$ is integrally closed for all $x\in X$ ) I've read many proofs of this fact in books and I understood them. However my teacher said that it was a ''fairly easy exercise'' and gave us three steps to do it: Consider the case when $S$ has an irreducible component $Y$ of codimension 1, defined by an equation in $X$ Let $Y$ an afine subvariety of $X$ with $\text{codim}(Y)=1$ . Prove that $\mathcal{O}_Y$ is a discrete valuation ring, and hence the maximal ideal of $\mathcal{O}_Y$ is principal. Prove the general case using 1. and 2. I'm trying to find a conection with these and the proofs I've found in the books, but I don't see it. If I can get some help on how to aproach this exercise in this particular proof I'll be very grateful. (Although my teacher said it was not a dificult exercise, it does not look easy for me) Edit: My problem is that most books solve it in a short way but using plenty of previous results. What I am looking (if possible, I don't know if this exists) is a complete proof without refering to any strong result. I have a nice background on commutative algebra and abstract algebra in general, but very little knowledge about algebraic geometry (I've recently started to study it). So I am looking for a proof using commutative algebra methods. Of course, I dont want you to do all the work, I will be very happy with just an sketch of the proof, to make me think a bit and complete the gaps. Edit: This is my attempt, if you can help me to complete/correct it: Let $Y=V(f)$ and $y\in Y$ a point which is non-sigular as a point of $Y$ (this is posible since the set of singular points of a variety is proper). If we show that $y$ is non-singular as a point of $X$ we are done. Let us denote by $m_{X,y}$ , the maximal ideal of the local ring of $X$ at $y$ (same with $m_{Y,y}$ ).

The definition I'll use for DVR is Noetherian, dim 1, local and integrally closed. $\mathcal{O}_Y$ is known to be local, and it is integrally closed because $X$ is normal. Also, since it is the localization of a noetherian ring it is noetherian. But I don't know how to prove that it has dimension 1. No ideas for this step. I guess that using 2.

2,"Given a degree-two endomorphism of an elliptic curve, how to construct the following map to $\Bbb P^1$?","Given a degree-two endomorphism of an elliptic curve, how to construct the following map to ?",\Bbb P^1,"This is the first part of Hartshorne exercise IV.4.5. Let $(X,P_0)$ be an elliptic curve having an endomorphims $f:X\to X$ be of degree two. If we represent $X$ as a 2-1 cover of $\Bbb P^1$ by a morphism $\pi:X\to\Bbb P^1$ ramified at $P_0$ , then as in (4.4), show that there is another morphism $\pi':X\to \Bbb P^1$ and a morphism $g:\Bbb P^1\to\Bbb P^1$ , also of degree 2, such that $\pi\circ f=g\circ\pi'$ . Here's lemma IV.4.4 referenced above, where $X$ is used to denote an elliptic curve: Lemma : If $f_1:X\to\Bbb P^1$ and $f_2:X\to\Bbb P^1$ are any two morphisms of degree 2 from $X$ to $\Bbb P^1$ , then there are automorphisms $\sigma\in \operatorname{Aut} X$ and $\tau\in\operatorname{Aut} \Bbb P^1$ so that $f_2\circ\sigma=\tau\circ f_1$ . Proof : Let $P_1$ be a ramification point of $f_1$ and let $P_2$ be a ramification point of $f_2$ . Then since the group of automorphisms of $X$ is transitive, there is $\sigma\in\operatorname{Aut} X$ such that $\sigma(P_1)=P_2$ . On the other hand, $f_1$ is determined by the linear system $|2P_1|$ and $f_2$ is determined by $|2P_2|$ . Since $\sigma$ takes one to the other, $f_1$ and $f_2\circ\sigma$ correspond to the same linear system, so they differ only by an automorphism $\tau$ of $\Bbb P^1$ . I'm a little stuck in figuring out how to construct $\pi'$ and $g$ . It seems like I can't copy the proof of 4.4 directly, because $f$ is degree-two instead of an automorphism. But we can do something similar: $\pi$ is given by $|2P_0|$ , so $\pi\circ f$ is given by the map to $\Bbb P^1$ determined by $[(\pi\circ f)^*x:(\pi\circ f)^*y]$ where $(\pi\circ f)^*x$ and $(\pi\circ f)^*y$ are the images of $x,y\in\mathcal{O}_{\Bbb P^1}(1)$ under the composite pullback $\Gamma(\Bbb P^1,\mathcal{O}_{\Bbb P^1}(1))\to\Gamma(X,\mathcal{O}_X(2P_0))\to\Gamma(X,f^*\mathcal{O}_X(2P_0))$ . But I'm having trouble seeing how to factor this as $X\stackrel{\pi'}{\to}\Bbb P^1\stackrel{g}{\to}\Bbb P^1$ where $\pi'$ and $g$ both have degree two. I'm looking for help understanding what to do here. I did find this question which mentions the first two parts in passing, but it seems like they've got some things the wrong way around. Further attempts : By Riemann-Hurwitz and the assumption that our base field is not characteristic two, $f$ is unramified and therefore $f^{-1}(P_0)$ is two distinct points, say $Q_1,Q_2$ . Then $f^*\mathcal{O}_X(2P_0)\cong\mathcal{O}_X(2Q_1+2Q_2)$ , which has a four-dimensional space of global sections.

All scheme are finite type over an algebraically closed field $k$ . Let $f: X \rightarrow T$ be a flat projective morphism from $X$ to a nonsingular curve $T$ . Assume that there is a closed point $t \in T$ s.t. $X_t \sim \mathbb{P}^1_k$ . Then we need to show that there is a nonsingular curve $T'$ and a flat morphism $g: T' \rightarrow T$ whose image contains $T$ and $X' = X \times_T T'$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{P}^1_{T'}$ . By flatness and smoothness of the fibre of $t$ , we know that $f$ is smooth in a neighbourhood of every point of $X_t$ . But the singular locus is closed and its image by $f$ is closed not containing $t$ . Hence we have a neighbourhood $U$ of $t$ s.t. $f^{-1}(U)$ is in the smooth locus, i.e. $f: f^{-1}(U) \rightarrow U$ is smooth. Now by flatness $f_* \mathcal{O}_X$ is torsion free hence flat and locally free. By formal function theorem we know that it is of rank one. So every fibre is smooth connected curve of arithmetic genus $0$ , which must be $\mathbb{P}^1$ . Now we have reduced to the situation of a smooth family of $\mathbb{P}^1$ over a smooth curve. It remains to find the suitable local base $T'$ . Moreover, I wonder whether we can choose $g$ to be étale. It seems reasonable since étaleness is a reasonable replacement of analytically localness.

Hence we have a neighbourhood of s.t. is in the smooth locus, i.e. is smooth. Now by flatness is torsion free hence flat and locally free. By formal function theorem we know that it is of rank one. So every fibre is smooth connected curve of arithmetic genus , which must be . Now we have reduced to the situation of a smooth family of over a smooth curve. It remains to find the suitable local base . Moreover, I wonder whether we can choose to be étale. It seems reasonable since étaleness is a reasonable replacement of analytically localness.

The exercise is about showing that $X:=C\times_{\mathbb C} \mathbb P_{\mathbb C}^1$ is neither Fano, Calabi-Yau, nor general type where $C$ is a smooth complex curve of genus $>1$ . Since $\Omega_X = \text{pr}_1^\ast\Omega_C\oplus\text{pr}_2^\ast\Omega_{\mathbb P^1}$ , we have $K_X = \text{pr}_1^\ast K_C\otimes \text{pr}_2^\ast K_{\mathbb P^1}$ and I can show that $X$ is not Fano nor CY. To show that $X$ is not general type, I need to show that the Kodaira dimension of $X$ is not $2$ . The Kodaira dimension is defined as the least integer $m$ such that $h^0(X,K_X^j)/j^m$ is bounded for $j>0$ . Some google search tells me $H^0(X, K_X^j) = 0$ for all $j>0$ , so I tried to show this as follows. Let $s$ be a section of $K_X^j$ . Then, for any point $p\in C$ , pulling back $s$ to $p\times \mathbb P_{\mathbb C}^1$ , we have $s=0$ since we can see that $K_X=\text{pr}_1^\ast K_C\otimes \text{pr}_2^\ast K_{\mathbb P^1}$ pulls back to $\mathcal O_{\mathbb P^1}\otimes K_{\mathbb P^1}=\mathcal O(-2)$ by considering the compositions $$ p\times \mathbb P^1\to C\times\mathbb P^1 \to \mathbb P^1\\ p\times \mathbb P^1\to C\times\mathbb P^1\to C $$ Therefore, $s$ pulls back to zero for any choice of $p\in C$ . Considering affine open subsets $\text{Spec} A, \text{Spec}B$ of $C,\mathbb P^1$ , respectively, the above translates to algebra as the following: given a $A\otimes B$ module $M$ and $s\in M$ , we have $s\in \mathfrak m M$ for all maximal ideals $\mathfrak m$ of $A$ .

Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field and consider the linear algebraic group $G=GL_n$ , whose affine algebra is given by $k[G]=k[T_{i,j},\Delta^{-1}]_{1\leq i,j \leq n}$ where $\Delta=\det(T_{i,j})$ .

Then, there is a natural isomorphism $$\mathcal D_{G,H}\cap L(G) \cong L(H)$$ Whence, to prove that $L(H)$ identifies with $\mathfrak{sl}_n$ , I need to show the following: We have $D_X(\Delta - 1) \in (\Delta - 1)$ if and only if $\operatorname{Trace}(X)=0$ .

We need to distinguish between points (prime ideals in the coordinate ring $K[x,y] \bmod f$ ) and places (prime ideals in the maximal order $O$ ) in order to handle singularities, where there are multiple places at a single point. For example, the curve $y^2 = x^3+x^2$ has a singularity at the origin; there are two places at a single point: A function like $x/y$ can not be evaluated at the origin just by plugging in values for $x$ and $y$ .  Not only do you get zero divided by zero, but the value is indeterminate because we need to specify which branch of the curve we're on, i.e, which place .

Show that the number of inflection points of $X$ is $6(g-1)+3d$ (nodes do not count as inflection points). To answer this, I will use three pieces of data: first is the degree formula for singular curves. I should have $g_X=\frac{1}{2}(d-1)(d-2)-r$ . Second, I will use the fact that if we define a map $X \mapsto L$ by $x \mapsto T_x(X) \cap L$ for some $\mathbb{P}^1$ named $L$ (where $L$ is chosen not tangent to X in $\mathbb{P}^2$ ), this morphism has degree $d(d-1)$ . Moreover, this map is ramified if and only if $x$ is an inflection point or $x$ lies on $L$ . Lastly I will use the Hurwitz theorem: given a map $f: X \rightarrow Y$ of curves, $2g_X-2=d_f(2g_Y-2)+deg(R)$ , where $d_f$ is the degree of $f$ and $R$ is the ramification divisor on $X$ .

For the following, let's assume $\Lambda$ is a finite group of order prime to the characteristic of all schemes we are working with. In chapter III, paragraph 4 is about a ""local"" Picard-Lefschetz formula which statement starts as following: Let S be the spectrum of a strictly Henselian local ring $R$ , $f: X \to S$ a proper flat morphism of odd fiber dimension, let $X_s$ be its special fiber and $X_\eta$ its generic fiber. Assume $f$ is such that it is singular on a single point $a$ , then the strict henselization of $\mathcal{O}_{X,a}$ is $R$ -isomorphic to $R[X_1,\ldots X_n]/\left(\sum\limits_{\nu = 0}^mX_\nu X_{\nu+m+1} + \lambda\right)$ for some $\lambda \in \mathfrak{m}(R)$ . Then $H^\nu(X_\eta,\Lambda) \cong H^{\nu}(X_s, \Lambda)$ for all $\nu \neq n, n+1$ , There is a ""vanishing cycle"" $\delta \in H^n(X_\eta, \Lambda)\otimes \Lambda(m)$ and a ""covanishing cycle"" $\delta^* \in H^{n + 1}(X_s, \Lambda(n-m))$ ... The vanishing and covanishing cycle are then constructed as follow: First recall the normal form of smooth quadrics: they are the zero sets in $\mathbb{P}^{n+1}$ of the $n+2$ variable quadratic forms: $Q = \sum\limits_{\nu=0}^mX_\nu X_{\nu+m+1} + x_{n+1}^2$ if $n = 2m+1 $ $Q = \sum\limits_{\nu=0}^mX_\nu X_{\nu+m+1}$ if $n = 2m$ . Now for a quadric $Y$ in the case $n = 2m$ , we consider the linear subspaces: $L_1: X_0 = \cdots = X_m = 0$ $L_2: X_0 = \cdots = X_{m-1} = X_{2m+1} = 0$ Let's call $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ the classes in $H^n(Y, \Lambda(m))$ associated to these cycles. They are such that $H^n(Y, \Lambda(m)) = \Lambda.\theta_1 + \Lambda.\theta_2$ . Now in an odd-dimensional quadric $X$ in normal form, the hyperplane section $X_{n+1} = 0$ may be identified with $Y$ , call $X_e$ the complement $X \setminus Y$ , it is an affine quadric defined by $\sum\limits_{\nu = 0}^m X_\nu X_{\nu+m+1} + 1 $ , one has a long exact sequence \begin{align*} H_c^{\nu}(X_e, \Lambda(-)) \rightarrow H^{\nu}(X, \Lambda(-)) \rightarrow H^{\nu}(Y, \Lambda(-)) \overset{\partial}{\rightarrow} \cdots \end{align*} The image $\theta$ of either $\theta_1$ or $\theta_2$ by $\partial$ in $H^{n}_c(X_e, \Lambda(m))$ is then a generator of it. Then, in the setting of the Picard-Lefschetz formula, the vanishing cycle is the image of $\theta$ in $H^n(X_\eta, \Lambda)$ (the morphism is induced by the same exact triangle but with $X_{\eta}$ instead of $X$ . The vanishing cycles are uniquely determined up to sign. Now in a latter theorem, there are some cases handling the case of a null vanishing cycle. It comes as a surprise to me, because I don't really see in the construction where the cycle could become zero. $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ determine the cohomology of a quadric, and they can't be $zero$ , same for $\theta$ I think (otherwise, by the long exact sequence, that would mean $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are images of elements of $H^{\nu}(X, \Lambda())$ , which seems impossible to me because of their definition, but I might be wrong here. The last point where $\delta$ could become zero would be if the image of $\theta$ in $H^{n}(X_\eta, \Lambda(-))$ is zero, which would mean that $\theta$ comes from a cycle in $H^{n-1}(Y_\eta, \Lambda(-))$ , which could be possible since this group is $\Lambda \oplus \Lambda$ ( $n = 2m+1$ and $Y$ is a quadric which lands in the  case $2m$ , so its $H^{n-1}$ is generated by two cycles). My question is: I have no idea of Wether this is actually correct, i.e wether I have correctly identified the conditions for $\delta$ to be null or not. Whether the case I described can actually happens (I think it could since later theorems handle the case of a null vanishing cycle). What it would actually mean for a vanishing cycle to be zero, so far I only see an algebraic condition and I have no intuition on what it should mean, or what should cause it to happen besides ""it could just happens sometimes"". I have read this MO question to help build my intuition of the Picard-Lefschetz formula, but the picture given is making me think even more that the vanishing cycle can not vanish. So I would gladly accept any answer providing me with either comprehensive references on the vanishing cycles in this case (I tried to read the relevant part of SGA7, but the situation seems similar and I can not understand why a vanishing cycle could be zero as well), or explain to me how it could happen, what it would mean and what is known about this case (besides the consequences on the monodromy being ""the singularity does not twist the monodromy action"").
