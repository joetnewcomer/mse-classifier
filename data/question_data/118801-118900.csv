2,Trigonometry Airplane question. Finding bearing and distance.,Trigonometry Airplane question. Finding bearing and distance.,,"A little background(if you don't care for my story, skip straight to the question): I've missed a few lectures from my teacher because I fell ill. Since I have no information to work with other than the bad notes a friend of mine has taken, I don't have much to work with. Now I'd love help with this problem because I've been at it for almost $3$ hours and nothing I try works. I don't need the answer at all, I have the answer, what I need is the process. I need to know how to get that answer. **Now the question is-**An airplane travels due west for $1.5$ hours at $320$ mph. then it changes course to $S31°W$. Fine the airplane's distance from its point of departure and its bearing, after a  total flight time of $3.5$ hours. What I know so far , sorry I wasn't as detailed as I should be. I have drawn it out, i know distance between from the starting point and when it changes direction being $480$. And the distance of the direction change to the end point which is $640$. I know the angle where the plane changes direction totals out to $121°$. I could be wrong with this information, but the point is I've taken many different approaches at this problem but have gotten no correct answers. I've taken it ""outside of the box"" and expanded the 480 line until i can drop it down to the end point and make the spot where those two lines meet a right angle, if that makes sense. I've used ""sohcahtoa"" and found out the lengths of that small right triangle, added it with the lengths of the large obtuse triangle to put it all together. The missing side is the hypotenuse and I used the Pythagorean theorem to find it, but the answer comes out wrong. I tried so many different values and processes, and nothing. For the missing angle I use the inverse of the tan function and got an answer for that, but it's also wrong. I'd appreciate any input, anything at all.","A little background(if you don't care for my story, skip straight to the question): I've missed a few lectures from my teacher because I fell ill.

25,Joined squares with concyclic edges,Joined squares with concyclic edges,,"[EDITED after feedback. Thanks, YNK] Two squares are joined at a corner, I am trying to figure out what conditions are needed to ensure that the vertices of one edge from each square all lie on the same circle. In the diagram below, the edge vertex sets that I would like to be concyclic are $\{A,B, F, G\}$ or $\{A,B, G, H\}$ . Three ways to start with one of the squares and generate another that meets the condition are shown below. I guess my questions are: Are these the only solutions ? If so, how can we prove this? Solution 1 Draw any circle through $A$ , $B$ Take rays from $B$ through the $C$ and the centre of the circle, $O$ , label the points where they cross the circle again as $F$ and $G$ . $\angle CFG = \angle BFG = 90^{\circ}$ . I think it should be easy to show that $A$ , $C$ , $G$ are collinear using symmetry. This makes $\angle GCF = \angle CGF = 45^{\circ}$ , so that $\triangle GCF$ is isosceles and $CF=FG$ . So we can 'complete the square' to get what we want. In terms of transformations, this solution can be obtained from the initial square by a rotation about $C$ of $135^{\circ}$ and a scale (centre $C$ ) by a suitable factor to make $F$ coincide with the circle. Solution 2 Starting as before, with any circle through $A$ , $B$ , we can draw a line through the centre of the circle and $C$ . Reflecting the square in this line gives a congruent one with the desired property. Solution 3 We can obtain another solution by applying starting with solution 1 and applying the operation (reflection) used for solution 2. This leads to the square labelled '3' below. We could have started with solution 2 and applied the operations that were used for solution 1 (rotate and scale) as, I believe, these operations commute. There is a slight difference between solution 3 and solutions 1 and 2. Starting from the point of contact and reading the edges in anti-clockwise order, the second edge coincides with the circle for solutions 1 and 2, while the third edge coincides for solution 3. Update Some playing with Geogebra seems to confirm that there are only 4 squares with the property, once the joining point $C$ is fixed. In the illustration below, $C$ is chosen, point $H$ can move freely around the circumference of the circle, parameterised by $\alpha$ , the angle that the radius to $H$ makes with the positive $x$ -axis. Extending $HC$ to $E$ and using the diameter from $E$ leads to $F$ for which $\angle FHC = 90^{\circ}$ . Varying $\alpha$ between $0$ and $2 \pi$ , we can generate a square whenever $|HF|=|CH|$ . The right hand plot shows the graphs for $|HF|$ and $|CH|$ as $\alpha$ varies, this seems to confirm four solutions that can lead to a square.","[EDITED after feedback.

67,How many quotients/remainders can we get for a given Gaussian integer?,How many quotients/remainders can we get for a given Gaussian integer?,,"This is a question which arose 1 from division of Gaussian integers . However, it seems to be basically a question about lattices in $\mathbb R^2$ . We know that if we consider $\mathbb Z[i]=\{a+bi; a,b\in\mathbb Z\}$ then we have a division with remainder, that is, for any $a,b\in\mathbb Z[i]$ with $b\ne 0$ there exist a quotient $q$ and a remainder $r$ such that $$a=qb+r, \qquad |r|<|b|.\tag{1}$$ This is basically the statement that $\mathbb Z[i]$ is an Euclidean domain (with norm $N(z)=|z|^2$ ). The equation $(1)$ is equivalent to $$\frac ab=q+\frac rb, \qquad \left|\frac rb\right| <1. \tag{2}$$ So we are basically asking whether for a given complex number (in fact, a Gaussian rational ) $\frac ab$ there is a Gaussian integer with distance at most one. 2 The following picture shows circles with radius one around each lattice point from $\mathbb Z[i]$ , to find $q$ we basically check whether $\frac rb$ belongs to one of these circles. We can see that the $q$ is not necessarily uniquely determined. Depending on the position of $\frac rb$ in the squares determined by $\mathbb Z[i]$ we can have up to four possibilities. Question. For a given $b\in\mathbb Z[i]$ , what are the numbers of possibilities we can get for $q$ ? For example, what is the characterization of $b$ 's such that, depending on $a$ , we can have either one or four possible choices for $q$ in $(1)$ ? What is the characterization of $b$ 's such that for some $a$ 's we might have only one choice, for other $a$ 's we can get two choices, and there are also $a$ 's with for possible choices for $q$ ? What are $b$ 's such that (depending on $a$ ) we might get one, two, three or four choices for $b$ ? If we look at the interpretation explained in $(2)$ , we are basically asking whether there are linear combinations of $\frac1b$ and $\frac ib$ which belong to areas denoted by $1$ , $2$ , $3$ , $4$ of some square in the grid. Let us have a look at some special cases: If $r=0$ , i.e. $\frac ab \in \mathbb Z[i]$ , then there is only one possibility how to choose $q$ . (And this is the only situation where we have single possibility.) Let us take $b=1-i$ for example, meaning that $\frac1b=\frac12(1+i)$ . We see that any multiple of $\frac1b$ by a Gaussian integer is either in the center of some of the squares or in some of it's vertices. So we see that we always get one or four possible remainders. (For example, $1=0\cdot(1-i)+1=1\cdot(1-i)+i=i\cdot(1-i)-i=(1+i)\cdot(1-i)-1$ .) If we take $b=2$ , this corresponds to multiples of $\frac12$ . So we get one , two or four possible remainders depending on $a$ . (For $a=1$ we have two possibilities, $1=0\cdot2+1=1\cdot2-1$ . For $a=1+i$ we have $1+i=0\cdot2+(1+i)=1\cdot2+(-1+i)=i\cdot2+(1-i)=(1+i)\cdot2+(-1-i)$ .) It seems plausible that if $|b|$ is large enough (to make multiples of $1/|b|$ rather dense) and $b$ isn't in some of the special directions (such as multiples of $1$ or $1+i$ by some unit, i.e., by $\pm1$ or $\pm i$ ) then we can hit all possible areas and there will be $a$ 's with one, two, three and four choices for $q$ . If the intuition suggested in the previous bullet point is correct, it seems that there will be finitely many exceptions, but typically we should get all four possibilities. However, it does not seem to be quite straightforward to get some estimate on what ""dense enough"" and ""special directions"" should be in this context. Moreover, ""dense enough"" (as used in the previous bullet point) seems to be dependent on the direction of the vector corresponding to $\frac1b$ . So it's quite possible that there is not some simple characterization - or that entirely different way of looking at the problem is needed. 1 I thought about this question after somebody recently asked in chat about non-uniqueness of division in Gaussian integers.

We wish to position an arc somewhere on the circle, which has an arc length equal to $\frac1c$ of the circle's circumference, such that we minimise the number of the $\{x_i\}$ that lie on the arc. Can we always position the arc such that at most $\frac1c$ of the points lie on it? Note: when $c$ is an integer, we can do this by the pigeonhole principle: we cover the circle in $c$ of the arcs, and so one of them must have $\frac1c$ or fewer of the $\{x_i\}$ lying on it.","Let's say we have some number of points $\{x_i\}$, which lie on a circle.
