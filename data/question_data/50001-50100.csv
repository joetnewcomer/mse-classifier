40,Integration by Parts: When can you not use the Table Method. Why?,Integration by Parts: When can you not use the Table Method. Why?,,"I'm learning about integration by parts, primarily from Stewart's text (7th edition). In a supplemental book I have it brings up something called the Table Method. I really find this method appealing because it looks easier and quicker on many problems. But I find it doesn't seem to work at all on some problems (maybe I'm wrong?). For example, consider: $\int ln(x)\space dx $ (I realize this is an easy one, but I wanted to try the Table Method on it). Using the table method I get: \begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline u& dv & \pm \\ \hline ln(x)& dx & +1\\ \hline 1/x & x & -1 \\ \hline -1/x^2 & x^2/2 & +1 \\ \hline & & -1 \end{array} It's apparent that u will never differentiate to zero. I do however see the start of the right answer in this problem using the first diagonal: ($x \ln x$). It seems that in other problems of this type I can do something special with the last full row when I can't get to zero. I can simply integrate the product of the first two cells of that row. So this would give me first diagonal, plus second diagnal, plus integral product: $x \ln x - {1 \over 2}x + \int-{1\over2}\space dx$ This then works out to $x \ln x - x + C$, which is the correct answer. I started writing this question thinking that $\int ln(x)\space dx $ can't be solved with the Table Method, but in the process of composing this question it appears it can be in a  similar way $\int e^x \cos x \space dx$ can be solved (at least with regards the handling of the last full row going across as an integral instead of diagonal as a non-integral). It took me a while to type all this so I thought I'd still go ahead and post it. I have some question though: Please verify if I'm correct. When you realize the u column will never hit zero, when do you stop? From what I can read it seems you stop once you try differentiating twice. Is this always the case? I would also like to know if there are problems for which this method cannot work. For example when I try $\int \arctan x \space dx$ I get a mess that doesn't appear to work (but maybe it does and I just don't see how).","I'm learning about integration by parts, primarily from Stewart's text (7th edition).

It is also fairly easy to obtain the explicit formula for this integral: $$J_r = (-1)^r (r!) x + (x-1)\sum_{j = 0}^{r-1} (-1)^j (r)_j \ln^{r-j}(1-x) \space\space\space(+C)$$ where $(r)_j = \prod_{k = 0}^{j-1} (r-k)$ is the falling factorial. We can use this to find a recursive relationship for the integral $$I_{r,n} := \int_{0}^{1} \ln^r(1-x)x^n \, dx$$ mentioned in the title. Skipping the finicky calculation part (applying IBP once using $J_r$ and moving $I_{r,n}$ to the LHS), we can calculate that $$I_{r,n} = \frac{(-1)^r r!}{(n+1)^2} - \frac{n}{n+1}\left(\sum\limits_{j = 1}^{r-1} (-1)^j (r)_j I_{r-j,n} - \sum\limits_{j = 0}^{r-1}(-1)^{j} (r)_j I_{r-j,n-1}\right)$$ with initial conditions $$I_{0,k} = \frac{1}{k+1} \text{ and } I_{r,0} = (-1)^r r!$$ The first initial condition is trivial, the second one can be calculated in the same way as the integral $J_r$ above, imposing the boundaries straight from the beginning. My question is: Does the relationship for $I_{r,n}$ entail a closed form (i.e. explicit) expression in terms of $r$ and $n$ ? If not, would it at least be possible to evaluate $I_{r,n}$ for some fixed $r \in \mathbb{N}$ ?
