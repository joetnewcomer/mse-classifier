(Geometrical) vectors are most naturally introduced as displacements in an affine space $\mathbb{A}$. E.g. a geometrical vector $\vec{v} \in \mathbb{V}$ (a vector space) can be thought of as a difference of two points (positions) $\mathcal{P, Q} \in \mathbb{A}$, so that $$\vec{v} = \mathcal{Q}-\mathcal{P}.$$ We can think of $\vec{v}$ as a good old fashioned arrow starting at $\mathcal{P}$ and ending at $\mathcal{Q}$.

My question is: how can we relate this form with the so-called ""curvature forms"" on the left-invariant metric (I use ""the"" since they're all equivalent)? I'll explain this question by steps: 1) By ""connection form"" I mean a matrix-valued 1-form on a manifold which satisfies $\nabla e_i=\omega^j_i\otimes e_j$ given a frame $\{e_j\}$. Is there a clear way to obtain the connection form from the M-C form? 2) Given the connection form $\omega$, we define the curvature form $\Theta=d\omega+\omega\wedge\omega$ (i.e. $\Theta^j_i=d\omega_i^j+\omega^j_k\wedge\omega^k_i$). It turns out that $\Theta$ is of the form $\frac{1}{2}R^i_{jkt}\theta^k\wedge\theta^t$, where $\{\theta^j\}$ is the dual coframe of $\{e_j\}$ and $R^i_{jkt}=R_{ijkt}$ is the $(4,0)$ curvature tensor $$R(X,Y,Z,W)=g(\tilde R(Z,W)Y,X)$$ where $\tilde R$ is the well-known curvature $(3,1)$ tensor $\tilde R(Z,W)Y=\nabla_Z\nabla_W Y-\nabla_Z\nabla_W Y-\nabla_{[Z,W]}Y$. 3) Now, if a relation between the M-C form and the connection form $\omega$ exists, it must not be that they simply are the same thing, since in that case the Maurer-Cartan equation would say that $\Theta$ is $0$, and therefore so is the curvature tensor, which isn't true for all Lie groups.

94,Conformal classes and almost-complex structures,Conformal classes and almost-complex structures,,"It is well-known that on closed oriented surfaces $S$, conformal classes of metrics on $S$ correspond bijectively to complex structures on $S$. My understanding is that this correspondance goes as follows: Given a metric $g$ on $S$, there is a unique almost-complex structure $J$ (which is automatically integrable in dimension 2) such that $g(u,Ju) = 0$ and that $u \wedge Ju$ is positively oriented for all tangent vectors $u$. i.e. the metric $g$ gives a way to ""rotate 90 degrees counter-clockwise"". Clearly, given a conformally equivalent metric $e^ug$, this construction gives the same $J$. Conversely, given an almost-complex structure $J$, we can take any metric $g$ and form the metric $h(u,v) = g(u,v) + g(Ju,Jv)$. Then since it is symmetric, we have $h(u,Ju) = h(Ju,JJu) = -h(u,Ju)$ so $h(u,Ju) = 0$, confirming that we have a bijection. Now let $S_1$ and $S_2$ be two Riemann surfaces and let $[g_1]$ and $[g_2]$ be the conformal classes of metrics corresponding to their complex structures. If $f : S_1 \to S_2$ is holomorphic, how are the two classes $[g_1]$ and $f^*[g_2]$ on $S_1$ related? In particular, if $f$ is a biholomorphism, does it follow that $[g_1] = f^*[g_2]$? If $f : (S_1,J_1) \to (S_2,J_2)$ is a holomorphic map, then $df \circ J_1 = J_2 \circ df$ where $df$ is the differential of $f$. So if $f$ is actually a biholomorphism and the underlying spaces $S_1 = S_2 = S$ are the same, then the two complex structures $J_1$ and $J_2$ would be conjugate; $(df) \circ J_1 \circ (df)^{-1} = J_2$. This suggests that my last statement in the second paragraph should not be true as is since these two almost-complex structures don't seem to give the same orthogonal vectors in the construction of the first paragraph. Still, something almost as strong should be true but I can't exactly figure out what.","It is well-known that on closed oriented surfaces $S$, conformal classes of metrics on $S$ correspond bijectively to complex structures on $S$. My understanding is that this correspondance goes as follows: Given a metric $g$ on $S$, there is a unique almost-complex structure $J$ (which is automatically integrable in dimension 2) such that $g(u,Ju) = 0$ and that $u \wedge Ju$ is positively oriented for all tangent vectors $u$. i.e. the metric $g$ gives a way to ""rotate 90 degrees counter-clockwise"". Clearly, given a conformally equivalent metric $e^ug$, this construction gives the same $J$. Conversely, given an almost-complex structure $J$, we can take any metric $g$ and form the metric $h(u,v) = g(u,v) + g(Ju,Jv)$. Then since it is symmetric, we have $h(u,Ju) = h(Ju,JJu) = -h(u,Ju)$ so $h(u,Ju) = 0$, confirming that we have a bijection. Now let $S_1$ and $S_2$ be two Riemann surfaces and let $[g_1]$ and $[g_2]$ be the conformal classes of metrics corresponding to their complex structures. If $f : S_1 \to S_2$ is holomorphic, how are the two classes $[g_1]$ and $f^*[g_2]$ on $S_1$ related? In particular, if $f$ is a biholomorphism, does it follow that $[g_1] = f^*[g_2]$? If $f : (S_1,J_1) \to (S_2,J_2)$ is a holomorphic map, then $df \circ J_1 = J_2 \circ df$ where $df$ is the differential of $f$. So if $f$ is actually a biholomorphism and the underlying spaces $S_1 = S_2 = S$ are the same, then the two complex structures $J_1$ and $J_2$ would be conjugate; $(df) \circ J_1 \circ (df)^{-1} = J_2$. This suggests that my last statement in the second paragraph should not be true as is since these two almost-complex structures don't seem to give the same orthogonal vectors in the construction of the first paragraph. Still, something almost as strong should be true but I can't exactly figure out what.",,"['differential-geometry', 'riemannian-geometry', 'riemann-surfaces', 'complex-geometry', 'conformal-geometry']"
95,"How ""far"" a differential form is from an exterior product","How ""far"" a differential form is from an exterior product",,"Consider two differential manifolds $X$ and $Y$. Consider now a differential form (of any order) $\omega$ on $X\times Y$. The easiest example is taking $\omega=\xi\wedge\eta$, where $\xi$ is a differential form on $X$ and $\eta$ is a differential form on $Y$. In general, any form $\omega$ is not such an exterior product. Is there a way to ""measure"" how much $\omega$ differs from being such a decomposition? I'm looking for something in the ""spirit"" of: The rank of a matrix measures how much the matrix differs from being a tensor product of two vectors. Is there an analogous quantity for differential forms? Thanks.","Consider two differential manifolds $X$ and $Y$. Consider now a differential form (of any order) $\omega$ on $X\times Y$.
