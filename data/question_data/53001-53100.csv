0,On the number of ways to draw kissing circles,On the number of ways to draw kissing circles,,"So I was watching Numberphile with Neil Sloane of OEIS fame on the number of ways to make circles intersect. During the intro, he explicitly forbid kissing (touching, tangent) circles. This made me think about the number of ways to draw circles that must all kiss, where intersections are not allowed . Kind of the dual problem, if you will. So in a nutshell: Circles in the affine plane can be of any finite size Circles must kiss at least one other (no separate circles, all must be connected) Solutions that can be transformed into each other through mirroring, rotation, stretching, moving circles without making new tangent points, are considered the same For $n=2$ circles there are two ways: touching on the outside, and touching on the inside of the larger circle. For $n=3$ I believe the answer is 9. Try it, should be easy. For $n=4$ I started drawing and came up with, so far, and with help from you guys, 38, 39, 42, 43, 44, 45, 47, 44 ways. The colored dots represent the number of kissing circles at the tangent points. Questions: Did I miss any? I'm sure I did. Do I have inadvertent duplicates? Does an integer sequence exist, or even a formula mapping $n = 2, 3, 4, ...$ to $2, 9, 44, ...$ ?","So I was watching Numberphile with Neil Sloane of OEIS fame on the number of ways to make circles intersect.

I discovered a relatively simple algorithm to generate these patterns: simply take $(n+2^p-1)^p$ and subtract $(n+2^p-2)^p$ (using $n\to n-1$) to get a polynomial of degree $p-1$. Take this difference and subtract $(n+2^p-3)^p-(n+2^p-4)^p$ (using $n\to n-2$) to get a polynomial of degree $p-2$. Repeat this process until $n^p$ is reach.

4,Is this formula for $\frac{e^2-3}{e^2+1}$ known? How to prove it?,Is this formula for  known? How to prove it?,\frac{e^2-3}{e^2+1},"I found an interesting infinite sequence recently in the form of a 'two storey continued fraction' with natural number entries: $$\frac{e^2-3}{e^2+1}=\cfrac{2-\cfrac{3-\cfrac{4-\cdots}{4+\cdots}}{3+\cfrac{4-\cdots}{4+\cdots}}}{2+\cfrac{3-\cfrac{4-\cdots}{4+\cdots}}{3+\cfrac{4-\cdots}{4+\cdots}}}$$ The numerical computation was done 'backwards', starting from some $x_n=1$ we compute: $$x_{n-1}=\frac{a_n-x_n}{a_n+x_n}$$ And so on, until we get to $x_0$. The sequence converges for $n \to \infty$ if $a_n>1$ (or so it seems). For constant $a_n$ we seem to have quadratic irrationals, for example: $$\frac{\sqrt{17}-3}{2}=\cfrac{2-\cfrac{2-\cfrac{2-\cdots}{2+\cdots}}{2+\cfrac{2-\cdots}{2+\cdots}}}{2+\cfrac{2-\cfrac{2-\cdots}{2+\cdots}}{2+\cfrac{2-\cdots}{2+\cdots}}}$$ For $a_n=2^n$ we seems to have: $$\frac{1}{2}=\cfrac{2-\cfrac{4-\cfrac{8-\cdots}{8+\cdots}}{4+\cfrac{8-\cdots}{8+\cdots}}}{2+\cfrac{4-\cfrac{8-\cdots}{8+\cdots}}{4+\cfrac{8-\cdots}{8+\cdots}}}$$ I found no other closed forms so far, and I don't know how to prove the formulas above. How can we prove them? What is known about such continued fractions? There is another curious thing. If we try to expand some number in this kind of fraction, we can do it the following way: $$x_0=x$$ $$a_0=\left[\frac{1}{x_0} \right]$$ $$x_1=\frac{1-a_0x_0}{1+a_0x_0}$$ $$a_1=\left[\frac{1}{x_1} \right]$$ However, this kind of expansion will not give us the above sequences. We will get faster growing entries. Moreover, the fraction will be finite for any rational number. For example, in the list notation: $$\frac{3}{29}=[9,28]$$ You can easily check this expansion for any rational number. As for the constant above we get: $$\frac{e^2-3}{e^2+1}=[1,3,31,74,315,750,14286,\dots]$$ Not the same as $[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,\dots]$ above! We have similar sequences growing exponentially for any irrational number I checked. $$e-2=[1,6,121,284,1260,3404,25678,\dots]$$ $$\pi-3=[7,224,471,2195,10493,46032,119223,\dots]$$ By the way, if we try CF convergents, we get almost the same expansion, but finite: $$\frac{355}{113}-3=[7,225]$$ $$\frac{4272943}{1360120}-3=[7,224,471,2195,18596,227459,\dots]$$ So, the convergents of this sequence are not the same as for the simple continued fraction, but similar. Comparing the expansion by the method above and the closed forms at the top of the post, we can see that, unlike for simple continued fractions, this expansion is not unique. Can we explain why? Here is the Mathematica code to compute the limit of the first fraction: Nm = 50; Cf = Table[j, {j, 1, Nm}]; b0 = (Cf[[Nm]] - 1)/(Cf[[Nm]] + 1); Do[b1 = N[(Cf[[Nm - j]] - b0)/(Cf[[Nm - j]] + b0), 7500];  b0 = b1, {j, 1, Nm - 2}] N[b0/Cf[[1]], 50] And here is the code to obtain the expansion in the usual way: x = (E^2 - 3)/(E^2 + 1); x0 = x; Nm = 27; Cf = Table[1, {j, 1, Nm}]; Do[If[x0 != 0, a = Floor[1/x0];   x1 = N[(1 - x0 a)/(x0 a + 1), 19500];   Print[j, "" "", a, "" "", N[x1, 16]];   Cf[[j]] = a;   x0 = x1], {j, 1, Nm}] b0 = (1 - 1/Cf[[Nm]])/(1 + 1/Cf[[Nm]]); Do[b1 = N[(1 - b0/Cf[[Nm - j]])/(1 + b0/Cf[[Nm - j]]), 7500];  b0 = b1, {j, 1, Nm - 2}] N[x - b0/Cf[[1]], 20] Update I have derived the forward recurrence relations for numerator and denominator: $$p_{n+1}=(a_n-1)p_n+2a_{n-1}p_{n-1}$$ $$q_{n+1}=(a_n-1)q_n+2a_{n-1}q_{n-1}$$ They have the same form as for generalized continued fractions (a special case).

We have similar sequences growing exponentially for any irrational number I checked. $$e-2=[1,6,121,284,1260,3404,25678,\dots]$$ $$\pi-3=[7,224,471,2195,10493,46032,119223,\dots]$$ By the way, if we try CF convergents, we get almost the same expansion, but finite: $$\frac{355}{113}-3=[7,225]$$ $$\frac{4272943}{1360120}-3=[7,224,471,2195,18596,227459,\dots]$$ So, the convergents of this sequence are not the same as for the simple continued fraction, but similar. Comparing the expansion by the method above and the closed forms at the top of the post, we can see that, unlike for simple continued fractions, this expansion is not unique. Can we explain why? Here is the Mathematica code to compute the limit of the first fraction: Nm = 50; Cf = Table[j, {j, 1, Nm}]; b0 = (Cf[[Nm]] - 1)/(Cf[[Nm]] + 1); Do[b1 = N[(Cf[[Nm - j]] - b0)/(Cf[[Nm - j]] + b0), 7500];  b0 = b1, {j, 1, Nm - 2}] N[b0/Cf[[1]], 50] And here is the code to obtain the expansion in the usual way: x = (E^2 - 3)/(E^2 + 1); x0 = x; Nm = 27; Cf = Table[1, {j, 1, Nm}]; Do[If[x0 != 0, a = Floor[1/x0];   x1 = N[(1 - x0 a)/(x0 a + 1), 19500];   Print[j, "" "", a, "" "", N[x1, 16]];   Cf[[j]] = a;   x0 = x1], {j, 1, Nm}] b0 = (1 - 1/Cf[[Nm]])/(1 + 1/Cf[[Nm]]); Do[b1 = N[(1 - b0/Cf[[Nm - j]])/(1 + b0/Cf[[Nm - j]]), 7500];  b0 = b1, {j, 1, Nm - 2}] N[x - b0/Cf[[1]], 20] Update I have derived the forward recurrence relations for numerator and denominator: $$p_{n+1}=(a_n-1)p_n+2a_{n-1}p_{n-1}$$ $$q_{n+1}=(a_n-1)q_n+2a_{n-1}q_{n-1}$$ They have the same form as for generalized continued fractions (a special case).

15,Does this sequence always terminate or enter a cycle?,Does this sequence always terminate or enter a cycle?,,"I've been fiddling with the recursive sequence defined as follows: $$\begin{equation}   f_n=\begin{cases}     a, & n=1.\\     b, & n=2.\\ c, & n=3.\\ f_{n-1}f_{n-2}f_{n-3} \mod[f_{n-1}+f_{n-2}+f_{n-3}], & n>3.   \end{cases} \end{equation}$$ And no matter my initial choices of positive integers $a,b,c$ , it seems $ \{  f_n \}$ always terminates (three consecutive zeros) or enters a cycle. For instance, if $a=12,b=12,c=9$ , then the sequence becomes $12,12,9, 9,12,$ $12\dots$ My question: can we prove (or disprove) that for any positive integers $a,b,c$ , the sequence $\{ f_n\}$ will always terminate (three consecutive zeros) or enter a cycle? More important remarks in quotes. (Dec. 27) Remark 1.1: it appears (though I have not proved it) that my conjecture is true for the simpler recursive sequence $$\begin{equation}   f_n=\begin{cases}     a, & n=1.\\     b, & n=2.\\ f_{n-1}f_{n-2} \mod[f_{n-1}+f_{n-2}], & n>2.   \end{cases} \end{equation}$$ Perhaps this would be a better starting point. Hereafter, I will only be referring to the above. (Dec. 28) Remark 1.2: If $f_n=f_{n-1}$ and is odd, then $f_k=f_n$ for all $k>n$ . If $f_n=f_{n-1}$ and is even, the sequence will terminate. This can be proven simply enough. (Dec. 28) Remark 1.3: I conjecture that if $a$ is odd and $b>a+1$ is even, the sequence always terminates. Also, if $a$ is even and $b>a+1$ is odd, the sequence never terminates. (Dec. 28) Remark 1.4: the sequence reaches the cycle $\dots 5,7,11,5,7,11\dots$ for many choices of $a,b.$ Some pairs $(a,b)$ for which $f_n$ enters the cycle $\dots 5,7,11 \dots$ are $(3,5), (5,7), (7,11),$ $(7,3),(35,11),(44,13).$ There are probably infinitely many pairs $(a,b)$ for which this occurs. The frequency with which I see $5,7,11$ is probably due to my relatively small choices of integers. I wonder what the minimum of $X+Y+Z > 3$ is, where $X,Y,Z$ is a cycle eventually reached by the function. I wonder further if there are arbitrarily long sequences of numbers which this recurrence relation would cycle through for certain initial $a,b$ . I have not found any cycles longer than three terms, though $5,7,11$ is not the only three-term cycle I have found. For $(a,b) = (7,111111101)$ , the sequence eventually reaches the cycle $8496495, 3641355, 6068925$ . If we have $(a,b) = (6, 99)$ , the sequence reaches a different length- $3$ cycle. (Dec. 28) Remark 1.5: almost always, it seems that when $f_n$ does not terminate, the repeated terms are multiples of $5$ . Some exceptions are $\{ f_n \}^{(9,66)}$ , $\{ f_n \}^{(6,99)}$ , and $\{ f_n \}^{(3,11)}$ , where $\{ f_n \}^{(x,y)}$ is the sequence generated for $a=x,b=y$ . (Dec. 28) Remark 1.6: I conjecture $5,7,11$ are the only primes that appear in a distinct cycle (see Def. 1.1). In fact, it may even be the case that $5,7,11$ is the only distinct cycle with primes. (Dec. 29) Remark 1.7: I should probably state what the 'cycles' I am talking about are. Definition 1.1: $\{ f_n \}$ is said to enter cycle $X,Y,Z$ if for some $k>0$ we have $f_{k+3n} = X, f_{k+3n+1} =Y$ , and $f_{k+3n+2} = Z$ for all integer $n \geq 0$ . Definition 1.2: A cycle is said to be non-constant if $X,Y,Z$ are not all equal. Similarly, a cycle is said to be distinct if $X \neq Y \neq Z$ . (Dec. 29) Remark 1.8: It seems not every positive integer is part of a distinct cycle (see Def. 1.2) That is, there are some (in fact, many) integers for which, no matter our choice of integers $a,b > 0$ , the sequence $\{ f_n \}^{(a,b)}$ will not enter a distinct cycle with that integer.

16,A curious sequence (Ascending and descending a staircase),A curious sequence (Ascending and descending a staircase),,"The following story is true, not just to make it sound mysterious or coincidental. I found a very curious sequence of integers, and searching it gave no result. I am trying to learn more about it, just for fun. We were taking a break with two friends, and came up with the following game in the staircase: Assume there are $n$ stairs (so $n+1$ places to stand); Starting from the bottom, go up 1 stair at a time, until you reach the top; Then turn around and go down 2 stairs at a time, until you can't go further; Then turn around and go up 3 stairs at a time, until you can't go further; .. Then 4, 5, 6, etc. stairs at a time, until you can't even make one step. Whatever the step size is when you stop (the one you cannot achieve), is characteristic of the number of stairs in the staircase, and we call it the Mona number (after my friend Mona). For Example: For $n=5$ we go up to the top, then down in sets of $2$ until we reach $1$, then up $3$ to $4$, then down $4$ to $0$, then up $5$ to $5$, and then we are stuck because there aren't $6$ stairs to go down from our current position. Therefore $M(5)=6$. From there, we wondered if we could find a formula for that number. Obviously it has to be at least 2 (going up the stairs one stair at a time should always be possible), but it is not monotonic with the number of stairs. The ""mirroring"" operation of ""turning around"" makes it quite difficult; in particular the system clearly has a memory, but the state of that memory does not only depend on the previous step size. So instead, we wrote a program for it (Matlab code): function k = mona(n)      assert( n >= 1 );         h = n;     k = 2;      while h >= k         h = mod(h,k);         h = n-h;         k = k+1;     end  end where n is the number of stairs, k is the step size, and h is the ""horizon"" -- aka the number of stairs remaining until the end of the staircase for a given step size. Plotting it for the first 1000 integers looks like this: I have thought about it for a while, but it is much more complicated to analyse than it seems, and the analytic formulation of the sequence is ugly so I'm not sure it can help. I would be curious to know whether this relates to any known integer process? And if not, whether you have a clever idea of how to analyse the Mona sequence? About the envelope As can be seen on the plot, there seems to be a bounding cone to the progression of this sequence. This ""envelope"" corresponds to the following cases (found programmatically): \begin{align} N_\mathrm{upper} &= \left\{ n\ |\ M(n)=n+1 \right\} = \{ 1,2,5,8,14,50,119,200,269,299, ... \} \\ N_\mathrm{lower} &= \left\{ n\ |\ M(n)=\left\lceil \frac{n}{2}\right\rceil + 1 \right\} = \{ 1,3,7,39,47,111,959, ... \}  \end{align} However once again, neither of these sequences give a hit in the OEIS.","The following story is true, not just to make it sound mysterious or coincidental.

We eventually conjectured that using only factorials and square roots you can get arbitrarily close to any number greater than or equal to $1$. But we are having trouble proving or disproving the conjecture. Precisely, start with the number $3$. Then take its factorial $m$ times, and then take the square root of its result $n$ times. Ie, $(3!!\ldots !)^{\frac{1}{2^n}}$ where there are $m$ factorials. Let the set of numbers achievable in this way be $X$. Is $X$ dense in $[1,\infty)$? The only progress we have made is to show that any interval $[x,x^2]$ for $x>1$ there is a limit point $a \in [x,x^2)$ of $X$. This is true because for any $z > x^2$ we can square root it an appropriate number of times to get it in $[x,x^2)$. We can do this for infinitely many points of the sequence $3,3!,3!!,\ldots$. And all points we get through this process are distinct. Let $F(m)$ be $3$ with $m$ factorials.

Edit Clement C suggested taking logarithm and it was a very useful suggestion, since I get the series: $$\ln \prod_{k \geq 2}\sqrt[k]{1+\frac{1}{k}}= \frac{1}{2} \ln \left(1+\frac{1}{2} \right)+\frac{1}{3} \ln \left(1+\frac{1}{3} \right)+\dots$$ I don't know how to find the closed form, but I can certainly use it to find the boundaries (since the series for logarithm are very simple). $$\frac{1}{2} \ln \left(1+\frac{1}{2} \right)+\frac{1}{3} \ln \left(1+\frac{1}{3} \right)+\dots>\sum^{\infty}_{k=2} \frac{1}{k^2}-\frac{1}{2}\sum^{\infty}_{k=2} \frac{1}{k^3}$$ $$\prod_{k \geq 2}\sqrt[k]{1+\frac{1}{k}}>\exp \left( \frac{\pi^2}{6}-\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\zeta (3)}{2} \right)=1.72272$$ $$\prod_{k \geq 2}\sqrt[k]{1+\frac{1}{k}}<\exp \left( \frac{\pi^2}{6}+\frac{\pi^4}{270}-\frac{5}{6}-\frac{\zeta (3)}{2} \right)=1.77065$$ $$\prod_{k \geq 2}\sqrt[k]{1+\frac{1}{k}}>\exp \left( \frac{\pi^2}{6}+\frac{\pi^4}{270}-\frac{7}{12}-\frac{\zeta (3)}{2} -\frac{\zeta (5)}{4}\right)=1.75438$$ $$\prod_{k \geq 2}\sqrt[k]{1+\frac{1}{k}}<\exp \left( \frac{\pi^2}{6}+\frac{\pi^4}{270}+\frac{\pi^6}{4725}-\frac{47}{60}-\frac{\zeta (3)}{2} -\frac{\zeta (5)}{4}\right)=1.76048$$ $$\prod_{k \geq 2}\sqrt[k]{1+\frac{1}{k}}>\exp \left( \frac{\pi^2}{6}+\frac{\pi^4}{270}+\frac{\pi^6}{4725}-\frac{37}{60}-\frac{\zeta (3)}{2} -\frac{\zeta (5)}{4} -\frac{\zeta (7)}{6}\right)=1.75803$$ This method generates much better bounds than my first idea. The last two are very good approximations. Edit 2 Actually, would it be correct to write (it gives the correct value of the product): $$\prod_{k \geq 2}\sqrt[k]{1+\frac{1}{k}}=\frac{1}{2} \exp \left( \sum_{k \geq 2} \frac{(-1)^k \zeta(k)}{k-1} \right)$$",,"['sequences-and-series', 'infinite-product']"

49,Are there an infinite number of primes of the form $\lfloor \pi n \rfloor$?,Are there an infinite number of primes of the form ?,\lfloor \pi n \rfloor,"Are there an infinite number of primes  of the form $\lfloor \pi n \rfloor$? This is sort of a clickbait title. I would really like to show that, for any real irrational $r > 1$, there are an infinite number of primes of the form $\lfloor r n \rfloor$ for positive integer $n$. I can show that there are an infinite number of primes of the form $\lfloor r n \rfloor$ for $r < 1+1/g$ for a fixed $g > 1$, but the best known value of $g$ is $246$ unconditionally and $6$ assuming an unproved conjecture. To prove this, I use the idea of Beatty sequences ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatty_sequence ). For a real $r > 1$, let $B(r) =\{\lfloor nr \rfloor \mid n \in \mathbb{N}^+\}$. ($\mathbb{N}^+$ is the set of positive integers.) Then Beatty's theorem states that $B(r)$ and $B(r/(r-1))$ make up a disjoint partition of $\mathbb{N}^+$. If there are only a finite number of primes in $B(r)$, then all the primes above a certain value are in $B(r/(r-1))$. We have $\lfloor (n+1)r \rfloor =\lfloor nr+r \rfloor \ge \lfloor nr \rfloor +\lfloor r \rfloor $. Therefore, if $r > 3$, $B(r)$ can not contain any twin primes. Therefore, if there are an infinite number of twin primes, $B(r/(r-1))$ must contain an infinite number of primes for all  $r > 3$, or $r/(r-1) \lt 3/2 $. The use of an unproved conjecture can be removed at the cost of a weaker conclusion by using the recent results on prime gaps ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_gap ). It has been shown that there is a constant $g$ such that there are an infinite number of consecutive primes that differ by at most $g$. It has been shown that $g \le 246$ unconditionally and that, assuming the Elliott–Halberstam conjecture ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott%E2%80%93Halberstam_conjecture ), $g \le 12$ ($g \le 6$ assuming a generalized form of the conjecture.). Arguing as before, if $r > g+1$, then $B(r)$ can not contain all the primes above any finite value. For, if it did, there are an infinite numer of consecutive primes $p$ and $q$ such that $q-p \le g$, and $p$ and $q$ can not both be in $B(r)$. Therefore $B(r/(r-1))$ must contain an infinite number of primes for $r > g+1$. Restating, $B(r)$ must contain an infinite number of primes for $r < (g+1)/g =1+1/g$.

70,Do runs of every length occur in this string?,Do runs of every length occur in this string?,,"In reference to the strings defined here (constructed by repeatedly appending the last ""half"" of the current string), consider the particular infinite string $s$ generated by starting with $\text{abc}$: $$\begin{align} \quad  &\text{abc}\\ &\text{abcbc}\\ &\text{abcbccbc}\\ &\text{abcbccbcccbc}\\ &\cdots\\ &\text{______________________________}\\ s = \ &\text{abcbccbcccbcbcccbccbcbcccbccccb...} \end{align} $$ More formally, the general rewriting rule is  $$a_0 a_1 \cdots a_{n-1} \ \ \to \ \ a_0 a_1 \cdots a_{n-1} a_{\left\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor } a_{\left\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor+1} \cdots a_{n-1}. $$ Clearly, $\text{a}$ occurs only in the initial position, $\text{b}^k$ occurs infinitely often for $k=1$, but never occurs for $k\ge2$, and one may conjecture that $\text{c}^k$ occurs for every $k\ge 1$ (and hence, infinitely often for each $k\ge 1$). How to prove or disprove the conjecture? Some possibly-relevant facts: Computations show that the index of the first occurrence of $\text{c}^k$ is as follows, for some small $k$: $$\begin{align} &\text{substring} \quad & \text{index}\\ &\text{c} &\text{2}\\ &\text{cc} &\text{4}\\ &\text{ccc} &\text{7}\\ &\text{cccc} &\text{26}\\ &\text{ccccc} &\text{27308}\\ &\text{cccccc} &\approx 10^{519}\\ &\text{ccccccc} &? \ (\gt 10^{40677})\\ \end{align} $$ (The exact index for the first occurrence of $\text{c}^6$ is a $520$-digit number, and $\text{c}^7$ does not occur in the first $10^{40677}$ terms of $s$.) Let $L_n$  be the length of the $n$th intermediate string in the generating process illustrated above. Then  $$L_{n+1} = L_n + \left\lfloor\frac{L_n + 1}{2}\right\rfloor,\ \ L_0 = 3.$$ Hence, $L_n$ grows exponentially:  $$L_n  \gtrsim 3(\frac{3}{2})^n.$$ Let $s_n$ be the $n$th intermediate string, and let $t_n$ be the $n$th appended string (so $s_n = s_{n-1} t_n$). Now, every intermediate string ends with $\text{bc}$, so $\text{c}^k$ would first occur only when some $t_n$ begins with $\text{c}^{k-1}$, in which case $s_n= s_{n-1} t_n$ will contain the first occurrence of $\text{c}^k$ beginning at index $L_{n-1}-1$. After $\text{c}^k$ first occurs, the number of instances of $\text{c}^k$ grows approximately exponentially in the number of iterations, as does the length, and the ratio $$p_k = \frac{\text{number of instances of c}^k\text{ on the }n\text{th iteration}}{L_n} \approx \frac{1}{\text{index of the first occurrence of c}^k} $$ is approximately a constant independent of $n$.  Since $\text{c}^{k+1}$ first occurs when one of these instances of $\text{c}^k$ happens to begin the ""last half"" of an intermediate string, this may be compared to a sequence of Bernoulli trials, each with success probability $p_k$. For such a process, the expected number of trials to get the first success is just $1/p_k$, so the index of the first occurrence of $\text{c}^{k+1}$ would be compared to  $$\frac{2}{3} L_{n_k + 1/p_k} \approx 2(\frac{3}{2})^{n_k + i_k}  $$ where $n_k$ is the number of iterations to get the first occurrence of $\text{c}^k$, and $i_k$ is the corresponding index. E.g., the first-occurrence index of $\text{c}^6$ would be compared to $2(\frac{3}{2})^{n_5 + i_5} = 2(\frac{3}{2})^{22 + 27308} \approx 10^{4813}$ (when in fact it is approximately $10^{519}$). Similarly, the first-occurrence index for $\text{c}^7$ (if it exists) would be compared to $2(\frac{3}{2})^{n_6 + i_6} \approx 10^{10^{518}}$. These comparisons are quite poor, but may help to understand how the first-occurrence indices can be so enormous.","In reference to the strings defined here (constructed by repeatedly appending the last ""half"" of the current string), consider the particular infinite string $s$ generated by starting with $\text{abc}$: $$\begin{align} \quad  &\text{abc}\\ &\text{abcbc}\\ &\text{abcbccbc}\\ &\text{abcbccbcccbc}\\ &\cdots\\ &\text{______________________________}\\ s = \ &\text{abcbccbcccbcbcccbccbcbcccbccccb...} \end{align} $$ More formally, the general rewriting rule is  $$a_0 a_1 \cdots a_{n-1} \ \ \to \ \ a_0 a_1 \cdots a_{n-1} a_{\left\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor } a_{\left\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor+1} \cdots a_{n-1}. $$ Clearly, $\text{a}$ occurs only in the initial position, $\text{b}^k$ occurs infinitely often for $k=1$, but never occurs for $k\ge2$, and one may conjecture that $\text{c}^k$ occurs for every $k\ge 1$ (and hence, infinitely often for each $k\ge 1$). How to prove or disprove the conjecture? Some possibly-relevant facts: Computations show that the index of the first occurrence of $\text{c}^k$ is as follows, for some small $k$: $$\begin{align} &\text{substring} \quad & \text{index}\\ &\text{c} &\text{2}\\ &\text{cc} &\text{4}\\ &\text{ccc} &\text{7}\\ &\text{cccc} &\text{26}\\ &\text{ccccc} &\text{27308}\\ &\text{cccccc} &\approx 10^{519}\\ &\text{ccccccc} &? \ (\gt 10^{40677})\\ \end{align} $$ (The exact index for the first occurrence of $\text{c}^6$ is a $520$-digit number, and $\text{c}^7$ does not occur in the first $10^{40677}$ terms of $s$.) Let $L_n$  be the length of the $n$th intermediate string in the generating process illustrated above. Then  $$L_{n+1} = L_n + \left\lfloor\frac{L_n + 1}{2}\right\rfloor,\ \ L_0 = 3.$$ Hence, $L_n$ grows exponentially:  $$L_n  \gtrsim 3(\frac{3}{2})^n.$$ Let $s_n$ be the $n$th intermediate string, and let $t_n$ be the $n$th appended string (so $s_n = s_{n-1} t_n$). Now, every intermediate string ends with $\text{bc}$, so $\text{c}^k$ would first occur only when some $t_n$ begins with $\text{c}^{k-1}$, in which case $s_n= s_{n-1} t_n$ will contain the first occurrence of $\text{c}^k$ beginning at index $L_{n-1}-1$. After $\text{c}^k$ first occurs, the number of instances of $\text{c}^k$ grows approximately exponentially in the number of iterations, as does the length, and the ratio $$p_k = \frac{\text{number of instances of c}^k\text{ on the }n\text{th iteration}}{L_n} \approx \frac{1}{\text{index of the first occurrence of c}^k} $$ is approximately a constant independent of $n$.  Since $\text{c}^{k+1}$ first occurs when one of these instances of $\text{c}^k$ happens to begin the ""last half"" of an intermediate string, this may be compared to a sequence of Bernoulli trials, each with success probability $p_k$. For such a process, the expected number of trials to get the first success is just $1/p_k$, so the index of the first occurrence of $\text{c}^{k+1}$ would be compared to  $$\frac{2}{3} L_{n_k + 1/p_k} \approx 2(\frac{3}{2})^{n_k + i_k}  $$ where $n_k$ is the number of iterations to get the first occurrence of $\text{c}^k$, and $i_k$ is the corresponding index. E.g., the first-occurrence index of $\text{c}^6$ would be compared to $2(\frac{3}{2})^{n_5 + i_5} = 2(\frac{3}{2})^{22 + 27308} \approx 10^{4813}$ (when in fact it is approximately $10^{519}$).

84,Double harmonic summation,Double harmonic summation,,"Let us consider a lattice formed by all points with integer and positive coordinates on a Cartesian plane, and where $K$ is the maximal value for the $x$-axis. Let us assign to each lattice point the value $1/(xy)$, where $x$ and $y$ are its coordinates. Drawing the two lines $y = x$ and $y = Jx$ (with $J$ real number $>1$), a triangular region between the two lines is identified. I would like to determine an asymptotic expansion for the summation of the values of all points included in this triangular region when $K$ tends to infinity. I calculated that this asymptotic expansion is given by $\log(K) \log(J) + O(1)$.  However, I am particularly interested in the limit of this constant term when $K$ tends to infinity, since it shows an irregular behaviour with several discontinuities when plotted against $J$ (see the Figure below, showing the value of this constant term on the $y$-axis vs $J$ on the $x$-axis). As shown in the Figure, for $J = 1$ (where the two lines coincide and the triangle reduces to a line crossing all points with $x = y$), the limit of the constant term, and in this case of the whole summmation, corresponds to the infinite sum of inverse squares, yielding $\pi^{2}/6 \approx 1.64$. Starting from this value, the function then shows discontinuities over its whole range. Just to describe two of them that are evident in magnitude and that have been highlighted in the Figure: for $J = 1.49999$ the limit of the constant term is about $1.025$, but for $J = 1.5$ it abruptly increases to about $1.30$. Similarly, for $J = 1.99999$ the limit of the constant term decreases to about $0.88$, whereas for $J = 2$ it abruptly increases to about $1.70$. The reason for all these discontinuities is that, as the $y = Jx$ line rotates counterclockwise (i.e., as $J$ increases), new sets of aligned points are progressively and discontinuously included in the triangular region. Accordingly, the largest discontinuities occur for integer values of $J$, as for these values new and relatively large sets of points are included in the region. Generalizing, the magnitude of each jump is equal to the sum of all points corresponding to the slope $J=\frac{y}{x}$ (where $\frac{y}{x}$ is an irreducible fraction), which in turn is given by the sum of inverse squares multiplied by $\displaystyle \frac{1}{xy}$. In this view, this question is equivalent to that of determining an asymptotic expansion for the double harmonic sum $\displaystyle \frac{1}{xy}$, calculated over all possibile coprime values of $x$ and $y$  such that $\frac{y}{x}$ is a rational number included in the interval between $1$ and $J$. I would like to determine a general expression for the constant term of this summation. I tried a number of approaches, including application of Euler-MacLaurin formula or Fourier transformations, but each attempt failed. I am not necessarily searching a closed form in the strict sense, which probably could not exist. Rather, I would be very interested in finding a more compact or elegant general expression for this term, in comparison with the trivial way of reporting it as the difference between the double harmonic summation and the logarithmic term $\log(K) \log(J)$.","Let us consider a lattice formed by all points with integer and positive coordinates on a Cartesian plane, and where $K$ is the maximal value for the $x$-axis.

However, I am particularly interested in the limit of this constant term when $K$ tends to infinity, since it shows an irregular behaviour with several discontinuities when plotted against $J$ (see the Figure below, showing the value of this constant term on the $y$-axis vs $J$ on the $x$-axis). As shown in the Figure, for $J = 1$ (where the two lines coincide and the triangle reduces to a line crossing all points with $x = y$), the limit of the constant term, and in this case of the whole summmation, corresponds to the infinite sum of inverse squares, yielding $\pi^{2}/6 \approx 1.64$. Starting from this value, the function then shows discontinuities over its whole range. Just to describe two of them that are evident in magnitude and that have been highlighted in the Figure: for $J = 1.49999$ the limit of the constant term is about $1.025$, but for $J = 1.5$ it abruptly increases to about $1.30$. Similarly, for $J = 1.99999$ the limit of the constant term decreases to about $0.88$, whereas for $J = 2$ it abruptly increases to about $1.70$. The reason for all these discontinuities is that, as the $y = Jx$ line rotates counterclockwise (i.e., as $J$ increases), new sets of aligned points are progressively and discontinuously included in the triangular region. Accordingly, the largest discontinuities occur for integer values of $J$, as for these values new and relatively large sets of points are included in the region. Generalizing, the magnitude of each jump is equal to the sum of all points corresponding to the slope $J=\frac{y}{x}$ (where $\frac{y}{x}$ is an irreducible fraction), which in turn is given by the sum of inverse squares multiplied by $\displaystyle \frac{1}{xy}$. In this view, this question is equivalent to that of determining an asymptotic expansion for the double harmonic sum $\displaystyle \frac{1}{xy}$, calculated over all possibile coprime values of $x$ and $y$  such that $\frac{y}{x}$ is a rational number included in the interval between $1$ and $J$. I would like to determine a general expression for the constant term of this summation. I tried a number of approaches, including application of Euler-MacLaurin formula or Fourier transformations, but each attempt failed. I am not necessarily searching a closed form in the strict sense, which probably could not exist. Rather, I would be very interested in finding a more compact or elegant general expression for this term, in comparison with the trivial way of reporting it as the difference between the double harmonic summation and the logarithmic term $\log(K) \log(J)$.",,"['sequences-and-series', 'number-theory', 'limits', 'summation', 'asymptotics']"
