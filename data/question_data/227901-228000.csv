Therefore, since there is no possible number of indices to label members of sets between finite natural numbers and $\aleph_0$ , there are no cardinalities between $\aleph_0$ and the cardinality of the continuum.

Duh. gets labeled by , by , etc. So, a set with cardinality only needs index. We also know that ordered -tuples (with finite ) also are countable, requiring only index to label them. What is the next possible number of indices you could require? . The very next possible number of indices that would generate a different cardinality is . If you have indices, each index being a natural number, the set of all such objects would basically be an ordered -Tuple. The cardinality of such a set is that of the continuum. Therefore, since there is no possible number of indices to label members of sets between finite natural numbers and , there are no cardinalities between and the cardinality of the continuum.

54,Uncountability of increasing functions on N,Uncountability of increasing functions on N,,"I believe I have made a reasonable attempt to answer the following question.

For each $f$ in $A$, there is a function $g: \mathbb{N}\cup \{0\} \to \mathbb{N} \cup\{0\}$ defined by $g(0)=f(1)$ and $g(n)=f(n+1)-f(n)$ for $n>0$.

I realized that I can do significantly better than this. In order to explain the method that has a smaller upper bound I have to transform the problem into graph theory. An equivalent formulation is to have $N$ vertices labeled from $1$ to $N$ . A pair of points are connected iff the two points add up to a square. Then our goal is to color the vertices using the least number of colors so that no two vertices with the same color are connected. The first step in the greedy algorithm for coloring vertices is to make a list of colors with numbers. (ex. RED-1, BLUE-2, GREEN-3, YELLOW-4, etc.) If during the process more colors are required than are on the coloring list, add more colors to the list. The next step is to pick an uncolored vertex and use the lowest color number that isn't connected that the chosen vertex. Repeat the last step until all vertices are colored. The worst case scenario is to use one more color than the degree value of the vertex with the greatest degree (or tied with the greatest degree). If each vertex that is connected to the greatest degree vertex is a different color then the greatest degree vertex has to be a different color from all of those. The vertex with the greatest degree (or tied with the greatest) is $3$ . It has degree $\lfloor\sqrt{N+3}\rfloor-1$ . Therefore the Number of sets (or colors) required is no more than $\lfloor\sqrt{N+3}\rfloor$ . We can do slightly better by using brooke's theorem which states that if a graph is simple, connected, not complete, and not an odd cycle, then the upper bound of the number of colors is equal to the degree of the greatest degree vertex. This means that the new upper bound is $\lfloor\sqrt{N+3}\rfloor-1$ sets. This is the significant improvment from $\lfloor\sqrt{2N-1}\rfloor$ I mentioned at the beginning. End edits For each natural number $X$ there are $\lfloor\sqrt{2X-1}\rfloor-\lfloor\sqrt{X}\rfloor$ numbers that are less than $X$ that when summed to $X$ results in a square. The expression: $\lfloor\sqrt{2X-1}\rfloor-\lfloor\sqrt{X}\rfloor$ increases as $X$ gets larger, because of this fact my guess is that separating the natural numbers into a finite number of sets so that no pair of numbers in a set doesn't sum to a square is impossible.","My attempt: is sufficient to show that two sets are impossible.

The basic proof of the other question, from my answer, is that for any $r$ in $\mathbb Q$ there is a single function $f(r)$ such that $f(r) \in \mathbb Z$, and the same holds between $\mathbb Z$ and $\mathbb N$.

I've got injections in both directions, no problem. The Schröder–Bernstein theorem tells us that this implies the existence of a bijection. I'm wondering if it's possible to construct one explicitly. (In what follows, I'm using the convention that $0\not\in\Bbb N$. This obviously doesn't change anything, cardinality-wise.) For $\Bbb R\to S_\Bbb N$, we note that every real number is the limit of some rearrangement of the alternating harmonic series. If $\alpha\in\Bbb R$, we start with positive terms: $1+\frac13+\frac15+\cdots$, until we obtain a partial sum greater than $\alpha$. We then add negative terms until our partial sum is less than $\alpha$, then we switch back to the positive terms, starting with the first unused one, etc. In this way, we construct a series, and if we take the absolute values of the reciprocals of the terms of it, we have a permutation of $\Bbb N$. This mapping is not onto , because many permutations of the series converge to $\alpha$ - all we have to do is ""overshoot"" at some point, and then continue converging to $\alpha$ as usual. (More trivially, we only get permutations with $\sigma(1)=1$ using this particular construction.) In the other direction, if we have a permutation $\sigma\in S_\Bbb N$, we can write the continued fraction $[\sigma(1);\sigma(2),\sigma(3),\ldots]$. This actually injects $S_\Bbb N$ into $\Bbb R\setminus\Bbb Q$, because non-terminating continued fractions represent irrational numbers. Thus, this mapping is not onto; it is not even onto the irrationals.For example, no permutation of $\Bbb N$ maps in this way to any quadratic irrational, or to $e$, or to any other irrational whose c.f. expansion has repeated terms. So, those injections are fun and all, but finding an explicit bijection seems hard. Clearly, a bijection between $S_\Bbb N$ and any interval would suffice, because there are standard, elementary ways to construct bijections between $\Bbb R$ and any interval.
