Q: A conference is to have eight presentations over the course of one day, consisting of three long presentations, and five short presentations.

A: Let S and L stand for a short and long presentation respectively. The schedule must start with a short presentation, and every long presentation must be followed by at least one short presentation. So the schedule must be SLSLSLS, along with one more short presentation inserted somewhere. There are four ways to do this - SSLSLSLS, SLSSLSLS, SLSLSSLS, and SLSLSLSS. For each of these there are 5! * 3! possible schedules, giving a total of 2880 schedules. My analysis gave 7200 schedules instead as follows. The first S is fixed. This leaves four S's and three L's to be permuted with the no-two-consecutive-L restriction. Or let's generalize it to a S's and b L's.

[1] in order to appreciate dynamic programming (which I found can run in time), I wonder what if we use a brute force search instead? So my actual question is what's the size of the search space if we're to use brute force search? I tried this: Words must be printed in fixed order. Suppose no empty line is allowed, we know the th words must come right after the th word and that they may either be on the same line or on adjacent line. We want to find the total number of arrangement of the word sequence. Consider the set of all arrangements of a sequence of words and the binary variable is only if the th word can be on the same line as the th word in the arrangement . Then which of course implies and since we have . However I'm not sure this is correct especially I haven't well defined what ""arrangement"" is using and ...

Context: I am  creating a single-player tile-based puzzle game where: Once tiles (200 in total) have been played in a slot (5 slots/tiles per turn), three or more of them cannot be played again together. This means any three or more of the initial five tiles, in any combination. If { 1 2 3 4 5 } has been played, then { 1 3 5 10 15} is now an illegal move for the rest of the game ; while { 1 3 6 10 15} is legal. Five tiles are played every turn until there are no more legal plays (only five tiles can ever be played; more or fewer than five is not a legal play) Question :  What is the shortest possible length of a game with all legal plays? My thoughts: So far I have discovered combinatorics seems the place to start, with a simple combination. Letting $n=200$ and $r=5$ . Order is not important (tiles can be played in any slot), repetition is not allowed (tiles are unique). The number of sets of five tiles is $$ C(n,r) = \binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{(r!(n-r)!)}. $$ This results in 2535650040 subsets, so as I understand it there are 2535650040 possible opening plays. Each turn concludes and removes more subsequent options for sets, and this is the part I'm having deep trouble getting my head around turning into a formula.

Thank you!","Please bear with me on terminology; I am learning! Also, please correct me if I've gotten anything wrong so far. Context: I am  creating a single-player tile-based puzzle game where: Once tiles (200 in total) have been played in a slot (5 slots/tiles per turn), three or more of them cannot be played again together. This means any three or more of the initial five tiles, in any combination. If { 1 2 3 4 5 } has been played, then { 1 3 5 10 15} is now an illegal move for the rest of the game ; while { 1 3 6 10 15} is legal. Five tiles are played every turn until there are no more legal plays (only five tiles can ever be played; more or fewer than five is not a legal play) Question :  What is the shortest possible length of a game with all legal plays? My thoughts: So far I have discovered combinatorics seems the place to start, with a simple combination. Letting and . Order is not important (tiles can be played in any slot), repetition is not allowed (tiles are unique).
