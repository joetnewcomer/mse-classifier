9,Clarifying Notation (Sets & Functions),Clarifying Notation (Sets & Functions),,"The basic problem is that I want to be extremely clear about the sets that mathematical manipulations and operations are taking place in, I am hoping for someone who really understands this to read what I've written closely and point out what is getting me all mixed up, though of course reading &/or responding isn't mandatory (lol) - but it is a long post even though it's dealing with just one idea. The set-theoretic definition of a function is f = (X,Y,F) where F is a subset of ordered pairs of the Cartesian product of X & Y, (i.e. F ⊆ (X x Y) a relation). This is Bourbaki's way of defining a function and he (they) call F the graph. But isn't a function itself a relation and therefore musn't we write (X,Y,f) as the set in which the function acts? To expand this out: (X,Y,f) = (X,Y,(X,Y,F)). I've come across notation that specifies (X,Y,f) as ((X,Y),f). Here, page 35 of this .pdf file So ((X,Y),f) = ((X,Y),((X,Y),F)) would seem to make sense. Bourbaki calls f a set & F it's graph but the notation in the .pdf file says that f would be defined in the way I've explained above, i.e. that F is a subset of XxY. The thing is that since a function f is itself a relation shouldn't it be a relation in a set, i.e. ((X,Y),f)? Assuming that the above is the way to think about these things, how would I think of both F & f? In f = (X,Y,F), F ⊆ (X x Y) so (x,y) ∈ F or xFy, where obviously (x∈X) & (y∈Y). How about f? I think f ⊆ (X x Y) so (x,y) ∈ f or xfy. I don't understand how this makes sense because for the set f = (X,Y,F) Bourbaki writes f : X → Y so for (X,Y,f) I'd have to set g = (X,Y,f) and write g : X → Y. This is a weird conclusion but it seems to suggest itself. The problem of being extremely clear about what sets you are using is particularly interesting when doing linear algebra. The use of set-theoretic notation in linear algebra both clarifies things for me and brings up similar questions, for a vector space V I could write ((V,+),(F,+',°),•) with the clarification that: in (V,+) we have + : V × V → V, in (F,+',°) we have (+' : F × F → F) & ( ° : F × F → F). In • we have (• : F × V → V) or perhaps [• : (V,+) × (F,+',°) → (V,+)]? This notation clearly illustrates why the two operations, vector addition and scalar multiplication are used on a vector space and the axioms for each clearly jump out, i.e. (V,+) is abelian, (F,+',°) is a field and • isn't the clearest to me but I think it's similar to the way that + & ° are related in a field, i.e. ""multiplication distributes over addition"". Relating all of this to the concerns I had above in a clear manner, in the set (F,+',°) it would make sense that +' is a set of the form (F,+'') where +'' is a subset of the cartesian product of F x F. Similarly with °, and in the set (V,+) you'd have something similar, also in • you'd have a crazy set ((V,+), (F,+',°), •') or including even more brackets (((V,+), (F,+',°)), •') with •' being a subset of the cartesian product of (V,+) & (F,+',°). There is another problem when you want to give a vector space a norm, would I write ((V,+),(F,+',°),•,⊗) where ⊗ : V x V → F ? Would ⊗ itself suggest the subset ((V,+), (F,+',°), ⊗') in the manner explained above? I don't think so because ⊗' would be the set of ordered pairs (x,a) with x ∈ V and a ∈ F but since V x V → F you've got the map (x,x') ↦ a, it's quite confusing tbh and need help with this.

14,Can (a certain interpretation of) the Ross-Littlewood paradox be formalized in set theory?,Can (a certain interpretation of) the Ross-Littlewood paradox be formalized in set theory?,,"In the Ross-Littlewood paradox , there is a supertask that goes as follows: At step 1, you add 10 balls to a jar labeled 1 through 10 and remove ball #1. At step 2, you add 10 balls to a jar labeled 11 through 20 and remove ball #2. At step 3, you add 10 balls to a jar labeled 21 through 30 and remove ball #3. This process goes on inductively, with each step taking half the time of the previous step (so that all this takes place in finite time). The question is, how many balls are left in the jar after the supertask is done? Based on the literature, it seems there are two sensible conclusions: either you can say the scenario is not physically sensible and thus there is no answer, or you can say there are precisely zero balls left. Now, my question is not about the paradox , so please leave the debate about it aside. Under some suitable interpretation , we can try to think about the process of adding and removing balls in terms of set theory with the final result being zero balls left. When I try to think about this, I am thinking of defining the sets $$ S_{1} = (\varnothing\cup\{1, \ldots, 10\})\setminus\{1\}, \qquad S_{2} = (S_{1}\cup\{11, \ldots, 20\})\setminus\{2\}, \qquad S_{3} = (S_{2}\cup\{21, \ldots, 30\})\setminus\{3\}, \qquad \ldots. $$ In general, $$ S_{n+1} = (S_{n}\cup\{10n+1, \ldots, 10(n+1)\})\setminus\{n+1\}. $$ We can either think of this as an infinite sequence of sets $S_{1}, S_{2}, \ldots$ or as an infinite sequence of operations (union, setminus, union, setminus, etc.) done to sets. Either way, it seems like there ought to be some sort of ""set limit"" which would be the empty set $\{\}$ . Is there any way in which this can be formalized? I am aware there are cases where no ""set limit"" could be assigned. For example, if we define $T_{1} = \{5\}$ , $T_{2} = \varnothing$ , $T_{3} = \{5\}$ , $T_{4} = \varnothing, \ldots$ , then I think there likely can't be any ""set limit"" assigned. However, I don't think this spoils the original question, because there are plenty of sums in real analysis that don't have any result such as $\sum_{n\ge 0} (-1)^{n}$ . The fact that the result of this sum is undefined doesn't mean other sums can't have a well-defined result.

I wonder about the logic behind this and ""what is logically allowed"", which is never explained in introductory courses. Q $1$ : What does ""Let $G$ be a group"" even mean? A $1$ : As far as I can tell, it means that one assumes that all properties of the object of interest, in this case a group, are true and one calls the object of interest $G$ . Explicitly this would mean that it is true that $G$ is a set equipped with an addition/multiplication (whatever definition you are using) satisfying the group laws. Note that as far as I can tell one does not know which elements are contained in $G$ , only that $G$ is a set satisfying some extra properties. Q $2$ : Why is the above a set? Since I use the naive set definition, meaning that any unordered collection of objects are sets, it is true that the collection of all $(g,g+g)$ is a set, which is exactly $\{(g,2g) \in G \times G \ | \ g \in G\}$ . Q $3$ : Why does this prove the statement? Or more generally, why does this method suffice to prove a for all statement in general? I think there would be two ways to view this: $(1)$ One proved the statement is correct using nothing but the properties of a group which any group obviously satisfies. Thus the proof is ""a path"" one could follow for any explicit group to show that the statement is indeed true. $(2)$ Assume there exists a group which does not satisfy a statement proven this way. Then one could go through the process of the proof with this object and comes to a contradiction.","It is taught that in order to prove ""for all"" statements such as one assumes that is a group and then proves the statement .

Explicitly this would mean that it is true that is a set equipped with an addition/multiplication (whatever definition you are using) satisfying the group laws. Note that as far as I can tell one does not know which elements are contained in , only that is a set satisfying some extra properties. Q : Why is the above a set? Since I use the naive set definition, meaning that any unordered collection of objects are sets, it is true that the collection of all is a set, which is exactly . Q : Why does this prove the statement? Or more generally, why does this method suffice to prove a for all statement in general? I think there would be two ways to view this: One proved the statement is correct using nothing but the properties of a group which any group obviously satisfies. Thus the proof is ""a path"" one could follow for any explicit group to show that the statement is indeed true. Assume there exists a group which does not satisfy a statement proven this way. Then one could go through the process of the proof with this object and comes to a contradiction.","P(G): \mathrm{For \ all \ groups} \ G \ \mathrm{it \ holds \ that} \ \{(g,g+g) \in G \times G \ | \ g \in G\} \ \mathrm{is \ a \ set} G P(G) 1 G 1 G G G G 2 (g,g+g) \{(g,2g) \in G \times G \ | \ g \in G\} 3 (1) (2)","['abstract-algebra', 'elementary-set-theory', 'logic', 'proof-writing']"

See here for a translation in English of Cantor's paper. The question I have is regarding the computation of the height function as defined by Cantor, for the equation: $$\begin{equation}a_0\omega^n+a_1\omega^{n-1}+\dots+a_n=0\tag{1}\end{equation}$$ where all coefficients are integers. Here is the relevant bit from Cantor: If we go back to equation (1), which an algebraic number $\omega$ satisfies and which, according to our restrictions, is completely determined, we can call the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients and the number $n-1$ (where $n$ is the degree of $\omega$ ) the height of the number $\omega$ and denote it with $N$ ; using the now common notation, we therefore have $$N=n-1+|a_0|+|a_1|+\dots+|a_n|.\tag{3}$$ According to this, the height $N$ is for each real algebraic number a specified positive integer; conversely for each positive integer value of $N$ there are only a finite number of algebraic real numbers with height $N$ ; let the number of these be $\varphi(N)$ ; for example, $\varphi(1)=1$ ; $\varphi(2)=2$ ; $\varphi(3)=4.$ Question: But when I try to compute $\varphi(N)$ , it doesn't match with Cantor's results! For example, consider $\varphi(2)$ - there are two possible cases, one for degree $n=1$ and other for degree $n=2$ . For $n=1$ we have from (3), $$2=1-1+|a_0|+|a_1|\implies 2=|a_0|+|a_1|\implies|a_0|=|a_1|=1\quad\text{or}\quad |a_0|=2$$ which corresponds respectively to the equations $\omega\pm 1=0$ and $2\omega = 0$ .

Let us consider $x_1=\frac{1}{n_1},x_2=\frac{1}{n_2}$ and assume that $h(x_1)=h(x_2),$ so $h\left(\frac{1}{n_1}\right)=h\left(\frac{1}{n_2}\right).$ Then, $$\frac{1}{n_1+2}=\frac{1}{n_2+2}\iff n_1+2=n_2+2$$ Therefore, $n_1=n_2,$ thus $x_1=x_2$ which proves that $h(x)$ is one-to-one. For $n\ge 1,$ $\frac{1}{n+2}\ne\frac{1}{2}$ Thus, only $x=0$ maps to $\frac12.$ Let us check identity function for the numbers $y=\frac1n,n>2.$ If we have $y=\frac1n,$ then there exists an element $x$ such that $\frac1n=h\left(\frac{1}{n-2}\right),$ $x=\frac1{n-2}$ Therefore, $h(x)$ is onto, so we conclude that $h(x)$ is bijective.

In fact, if $\mathcal{A}$ is the set of all pure subsets of $A$ containing a given pure subset $P$ , then for every totally ordered subset $\mathcal{C}$ of $\mathcal{A}$ , if $\bigcup\mathcal{C}$ is not pure, then it contains an $R\in\mathcal{R}$ , but $R$ is finite, say, $R=\{a_1,\dots,a_n\}$ , so for $i=1,\dots,n$ there is a $Q_i\in\mathcal{C}$ such that $a_i\in Q_i$ , then there is a $Q\in\mathcal{C}$ such that $Q_1,\dots,Q_n\subseteq Q$ , so $R\subseteq Q$ , contradicting the purity of $Q$ ; therefore $\bigcup\mathcal{C}\in\mathcal{P}$ . b) Because of maximality of $M$ , there is an $E\in\mathcal{F}(M)$ such that $E\cup\{x\}\in\mathcal{R}$ . If $F\in\mathcal{F}(M)$ , $F\neq E$ and $F\cup\{x\}\in\mathcal{R}$ , then $E\cup\{x\}\neq F\cup\{x\}$ and $x\in\left(E\cup\{x\}\right)\cap\left(F\cup\{x\}\right)$ , so by (MO') the set $\left(\left(E\cup\{x\}\right)\cup\left(F\cup\{x\}\right)\right)\setminus\{x\}$ is not pure, but: $$\left(\left(E\cup\{x\}\right)\cup\left(F\cup\{x\}\right)\right)\setminus\{x\}\subseteq E\cup F\subseteq M,$$ so $M$ will not be pure, a contradiction. Let $y\in E$ . If $R\subseteq(M\cup\{x\})\setminus\{y\}$ and $R\in\mathcal{R}$ , then $R\subseteq M\cup\{x\}$ , so, by purity of $M$ , $R=G\cup\{x\}$ for some $G\in\mathcal{F}(M)$ , and by (a) we have $G=E$ , but $y\notin G$ and $y\in E$ , a contradiction. Therefore $(M\cup\{x\})\setminus\{y\}$ is pure. Let $z\in A\setminus((M\cup\{x\})\setminus\{y\})$ , then $z=y\text{ or }(z\notin M\text{ and }z\neq x)$ . For the case $z=y$ , we have $((M\cup\{x\})\setminus\{y\})\cup\{y\}=M\cup\{x\}$ , that is not pure. For the case $z\neq y$ , then $z\notin M$ and $z\neq x$ , so there is a $H\in\mathcal{F}(M)$ such that $H\cup\{z\}\in\mathcal{R}$ , so: If $y\notin H\cup\{z\}$ , then: $$H\cup\{z\}\subseteq (M\cup\{z\})\setminus\{y\}\subseteq((M\cup\{x\})\setminus\{y\})\cup\{z\}.$$ If $y\in S$ , then $y\in(E\cup\{x\})\cap(H\cup\{z\})$ , so $((E\cup\{x\})\cup(H\cup\{z\}))\setminus\{y\}$ is not pure, and: $$((E\cup\{x\})\cup(H\cup\{z\}))\setminus\{y\}\subseteq((M\cup\{x\})\setminus\{y\})\cup\{z\}.$$ Therefore $((M\cup\{x\})\setminus\{y\})\cup\{z\}$ is not pure. So $(M\cup\{x\})\setminus\{y\}$ is maximal. c) Induction on $|N\setminus M|$ . If $|N\setminus M|=0$ , then $N\subseteq M$ , so by maximality of $N$ we have $N=M$ , so $|M|=|N|$ . If $|N\setminus M|>0$ , then there is a $m\in M\setminus N$ and there is an $n\in E_N(m)$ , so by item (b) the set $N'=(N\cup\{m\})\setminus\{n\}$ is pure maximal and $|N'\setminus M|<|N\setminus M|$ , so by induction hypothesis we have $|M|=|N'|$ , but $|N'|=|N|$ , so $|M|=|N|$ . d) If we assume (MO), then for $m\in M'$ we have $E_N(m)\cup\{m\}\in\mathcal{R}$ , so $E_N(m)\cup\{m\}\nsubseteq M$ , but $m\in M$ , so $E_N(m)\nsubseteq M$ , so there is an $x\in E_N(m)$ such that $x\notin M$ , so $x\in N'$ , and $E_M(x)\cup\{x\}\in\mathcal{R}$ , therefore: $$x\in(E_M(x)\cup\{x\})\cap(E_N(m)\cup\{m\}),$$ so we have two cases: If $E_M(x)\cup\{x\}=E_N(m)\cup\{m\}$ , then $x\in N'$ and $m\in E_M(x)$ . If $E_M(x)\cup\{x\}\neq E_N(m)\cup\{m\},$ then by (MO) the set $((E_M(x)\cup\{x\})\cap(E_N(m)\cup\{m\}))\setminus\{x\}$ is not pure, but it is contained in $M$ , a contradiction. Finally, by virtue of (c), we are reduced to the case where $M'$ and $N'$ are infinite, so: $$|M'|\leq|\bigcup_{x\in N'}E_M(x)|\leq\sum_{x\in N'}|E_M(x)|\leq\sum_{x\in N'}\aleph_0=|N'|\aleph_0=|N'|,$$ and analogously $|N'|\leq |M'|$ , so $|M'|=|N'|$ , and we conclude that $|M|=|N|$ .","Exercise This is Bourbaki Theory of Sets Chapter 3 Section 4 Exercise 11, English version: Let be a set and let be a subset of the set of finite subsets of . is said to be mobile if it satisfies the following condition: (MO) If , are two distinct elements of and if , then there exists belonging to such that .

47,"Prove that a transitive relation can be ""shortcutted""","Prove that a transitive relation can be ""shortcutted""",,"I want to prove the following theorem and already spent a lot of time on doing this, but almost unsuccessfully: Let $R$ be a transitive relation over the set $A$ . Prove that in the graphical representation of the relation (that is, the graph $(A, R)$ ), that $(u, v) \in R$ if $v$ is reachable from $u$ . So, reachability here I think means that there is a path from $u$ to $v$ . What I tried so far: I tried to prove that "" $v$ is reachable from $u$ $\implies uRv$ "" using contradiction that $u \not R v$ . I thought that if there is a path, then we can find some $x$ , where $uRx$ , but $x \not R v$ , otherwise it would mean that $uRv$ . And this led me to the conclusion that it must be at least one more point between $x$ and $v$ and so on ad infinitum. Another attempt was hiring contrapositive with further contradiction (if $u \not R v \implies v$ is not reachable from $u$ . Then for the sake of contradiction assuming that there is a path between $u$ and $v$ ). But this also led me to the same result as the first one. Since the first and the second attempts led me to an ""endless"" path between $u$ and $v$ I thought that induction can be a solution here. First of all, let's assume that any set, constructed of the elements of the path $uRx_1, x_1Rx_2, ..., x_nRv$ have the greatest element in respect to $R$ .  (I will prove it if my proof of the original theorem is correct). So let $P(n)$ is true when ""if there is $n$ -length path between $u$ and $v$ , then $uRv$ "" is true. I'm not sure but it seems that $P(0)$ is true, because there is always a zero-path between any elements. Let's consider any $n+1$ -length path and remove the greatest element $x_{n+1}$ from it. The resulting path has length $n$ , so that we sure know that $uRx_n$ . Now put the $x_{n+1}$ back and since we know that $x_{n + 1}$ is the greatest it means that $x_{n} R x_{n+1}$ . Then by transitivity we have that $uRx_{n+1}$ . UPDATE: First of all, let's assume that any set, constructed of the elements of the path $uRx_1, x_1Rx_2, ..., x_nRv$ have the greatest element in respect to $R$ Now I think that this lemma above is another way to prove the theorem. So if I proved it, I could prove that the greatest element is $v$ and then we would have $uRv$ . I'm sorry for a lot of text, but I'd like you to look at all my attempts and, probably, suggest how I can improve all of them to prove the theorem (if this is possible). So does my induction hypothesis seem good or is there a better one for this theorem? Is it correct to say that $P(0)$ is true? And could you please provide any hints how this theorem can be proved without induction (like I tried in my first and second attempts) if this is possible? I'd be also grateful if you can criticize my conclusions and assumptions.","I want to prove the following theorem and already spent a lot of time on doing this, but almost unsuccessfully: Let be a transitive relation over the set .

48,About the definition of the indexed set of a family,About the definition of the indexed set of a family,,"I'm a computer science student currently studying universal algebra by reading the book Foundations of Algebraic Specification and Formal Software Development by Donald Sannella and Andrzej Tarlecki. I'm having a hard time trying to understand the subtleties of indexed families. As far as I know, families are just maps between two sets: $I$ , the index set; and $A$ , the indexed set. That means that $|A|_{i_0}$ , which is the element of $A$ indexed by $i_0$ could be basically anything, like a number, a set, a collection, etc. And that the particular case where $I$ is $\mathbb{N}$ it is called a sequence. However, the definition of the product of an indexed family is: $ \prod_{i\in I} A_i=\{f:I\to \bigcup_{i\in I} A_i: (\forall i_0\in I)(f(i_0)\in A_{i_0})\}$ Considering the definition of a family, then the product could be also defined as the set of all families $ (a_i)_{i \mathop \in I}$ with $|a|_{i_0} \in |A|_{i_0}$ for each $i_0 \in I$ But then, it is implied that the indexed set ( $A$ ) must be a collection (a set of sets), because otherwise, $|A|_{i_0}$ could be an element like a number thus the union of $|A|_i$ would make no sense, since it only works for sets. So why does the definition of a family (at least the ones I've read on several math textbooks) does not require the indexed set to be a collection rather than just a set? Also, would this mean that the elements of a sequence must be sets (containing just one or more elements)? I'm use to thinking about elements of a sequence, specially when studying convergence, as just real numbers. And finally, I will give an example of what I understand so that you could tell me what I'm missing: I will define a family of countries indexed by their currency name. So: $I$ , the index set would be $I = \{pound, dollar,euro\} $ $A$ , the indexed set would be $A = \{\{Spain, Italy, France\},\{UK\},\{US, Canada\}\}$ Then, the family would be a mapping defined as: $(A_i)_{i \in I}= \{pound \rightarrow \{UK\},dollar \rightarrow \{US, Canada\}, euro \rightarrow \{Spain, Italy, France\} \} $ Finally, the product of the family $\prod_{i\in I} A_i$ will consist on a set of mappings (families) where each one of them has $I$ as index set, and maps each index to a set containing just one of the elements of the corresponding subset of $A$ . So in that way, each of these families will map the indexes to one of the six combinations possibles by picking one element from each subset of $A$ . Then the product of the family will be a set of exactly 6 families, somewhat similar to the Cartesian product of the subsets of $A$ .","I'm a computer science student currently studying universal algebra by reading the book Foundations of Algebraic Specification and Formal Software Development by Donald Sannella and Andrzej Tarlecki.

Hence I get that the rank of $\mathbb{Z}$ is $\omega$ as well. Similarly, $\mathbb{Q}$ can be thought of as a subset of $\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{Z}$ , and again, regardless of implementation details, each element in this set has finite rank, hence I get that the rank of $\mathbb{Q}$ is $\omega$ .
