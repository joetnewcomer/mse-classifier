1,Evaluating $\int_0^\pi\frac{e^{-\sin x}}{e^{-\sin x}+e\sin x}dx$,Evaluating,\int_0^\pi\frac{e^{-\sin x}}{e^{-\sin x}+e\sin x}dx,"I think I thought of this integral a little over a year ago and I just haven't been able to do it. I really want to and everytime I sit down with it I learn a little bit more (or atleast I think I do) and then I get really stumped and give up. The integral in question is $$I=\int_{0}^{\pi}\frac{e^{-\sin(x)}}{e^{-\sin(x)}+e\sin(x)}dx$$ Which can be rewritten into $$I=2\int_{0}^{\pi/2}\frac{e^{-\sin(x)}}{e^{-\sin(x)}+e\sin(x)}dx$$ by making note of the fact that the function enclosed in the integral is even. One other thing to note is that if we consider the $esin(x)$ term in the denominator and write a ""new"" integral with this term replacing the $e^{-\sin(x)}$ term in the numerator we get the following $$J=\int_{0}^{\pi}\frac{e\sin(x)}{e^{-\sin(x)}+e\sin(x)}dx.$$ Taking the sum of $I$ and $J$ we, of course, get the answer $\pi$ , meaning that a solution to either one would give a solution to the other (hopefully this helps in some way). I have a decent background and level of understanding with many of the more popular ""advanced"" integration techniques and special functions, so don't be afraid to write a really scary looking solution. Finally, I genuinely don't think there is a nice closed-form solution for this integral, but I don't know how to show that and am really hoping there is a closed-form. Best of luck with your solutions.","I think I thought of this integral a little over a year ago and I just haven't been able to do it.

6,Complex Trigonometry using a Complex Triangle,Complex Trigonometry using a Complex Triangle,,"When using the trigonometric functions with real numbers we often use a right triangle to visualize and simplify certain calculations. The same can be done when using the trigonometric functions with complex numbers with the triangle shown below: In this triangle all the sides and angles are complex. Additionally, those sides and angles satisfy the following properties: $$ z_1+z_2=z_3=\frac{\pi}{2}\\ w_1^2+w_2^2=w_3^2\\ $$ All the complex trigonometric functions obey the expected SOHCAHTOA relations on this triangle, and the inverse functions behave as expected as well. In particular, deriving the inverse trigonometric functions is made very easy by using this approach. For example, if we are given that: $$\sin^{-1}u=-i\ln\left(iu+\sqrt{1-u^2}\right)$$ and we are asked to derive a similar formula for $\cos^{-1}u$ then we can simply draw a complex right triangle with $w_1=\sqrt{1-u^2}, w_2=u, w_3=1$ , from which it is immediately clear that: $$\cos^{-1}u=\sin^{-1}\left[\sqrt{1-u^2}\right]=-i\ln\left[i\sqrt{1-u^2}+\sqrt{1-\left[\sqrt{1-u^2}\right]^2}\right]\\ =-i\ln\left(u+i\sqrt{1-u^2}\right)$$ The only drawback with this approach is that the real lengths and angles of the triangle have no connection with the complex sides and angles.

32,Change of angle inside a quirky hexagon,Change of angle inside a quirky hexagon,,"So I am dealing with the hexagon as shown in the picture below and I need to find out how one angle depends on another angle. More specifically, I need $\frac{d\psi}{d\varphi}$ at $\varphi=0$. Note that except for $\psi$ and $\varphi$, all angles are fixed and that $K$ and $L$ are fixed lengths. The vertex at the green angle $\gamma$ is uniquely defined since we are given four lengths and all six angles of a hexagon. Note that this is true since I know (from context) that the angles are chosen so that the green angle $\gamma$ is not equal to $\pi$ (which would mean that the hexagon is actually a pentagon in which case that point would of course not be unique). Clearly if $\varphi=0$, then the picture is symmetric and $\psi=\gamma/2$. That one is easy. What I need, though, is the rate of change $\frac{d\psi}{d\varphi}$ at $\varphi=0$. I found a solution but it is terribly ugly, so I was wondering if I ignored some basic trigonometry trick that simplifies this issue. Here is my solution. Consider this picture with some added info: By the law of cosines, $c^2=L^2+K^2-2KL\cos(\pi/6+\varphi)$, so we get $c$. By the law of cosines, $d^2=L^2+K^2-2KL\cos(\pi/6-\varphi)$, so we get $d$. By the law of sines, $\frac{\sin(\delta)}{K}=\frac{\sin(\varphi+\pi/6)}{c}$, so we get $\delta$. By the law of sines, $\frac{\sin(\epsilon)}{K}=\frac{\sin(\varphi-\pi/6)}{d}$, so we get $\epsilon$. Now we can combine the following two equations from the law of sines: $\frac{\sin \psi}{c}=\frac{\sin(\alpha-\delta)}{\ell}$ $\frac{\sin (\gamma-\psi)}{d}=\frac{\sin(\alpha-\epsilon)}{\ell}$ Combining them by eliminating $\ell$, we get $\frac{\sin(\alpha-\delta)}{\sin\psi}c=\frac{\sin(\alpha-\epsilon)}{\sin(\gamma-\psi)}d$. Now $\psi$ is the only unknown and I can implicitly differentiate the hell out of these equations and get some unwieldly formula for $d\psi/d\phi$ at $\phi=0$. I had to deal with a similar problem a while ago and at first I had a horrible formula only to later realize if only I had used the law of sines differently in one step, the equation would be much simpler. So I am wondering if there is a better way to do this besides the one above.","So I am dealing with the hexagon as shown in the picture below and I need to find out how one angle depends on another angle.

For example, using the trigonometric representation of the golden ratio, we can express it as: $$\phi=2 \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{5} \right)=\Re (e^{-i \frac{\pi}{5}})$$ The convergents of $e^{-i \frac{\pi}{5}}$ can be calculated with the following procedure: $$ \begin{bmatrix}p_n \\ q_n \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 1 \\1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}1-i \frac{\pi}{5} & 1 \\i \frac{\pi}{5} & 0 \end{bmatrix} \dots \begin{bmatrix}n-1-i \frac{\pi}{5} & 1 \\(n-2)i \frac{\pi}{5} & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}n-i \frac{\pi}{5} \\(n-1)i \frac{\pi}{5} \end{bmatrix}  $$ $$\phi \approx \Re (\frac{p_n}{q_n})$$ Curiously, this continued fraction converges much faster, than the simple continued fraction for $\phi$: $$\phi=1+\cfrac{1}{1+\cfrac{1}{1+\cfrac{1}{1+\cdots}}}$$ For $20$ iterations we obtain the following error and computation time (in Mathematica). For Euler's continued fraction: $$t=0.00191546~s$$ $$\delta= 2.1295 \cdot 10^{-24}$$ For a simple continued fraction: $$t=0.000310476~s$$ $$\delta= -3.7325 \cdot 10^{-9}$$ As you can see despite the longer computation, Euler's continued fraction gives almost triple precision for the same number of terms compared to the simple continued fraction. Is this way of computing trigonometric functions used anywhere? Is there some continued fraction for trigonometric functions with faster convergence, or is this the best one? Maybe there is a way to further increase the convergence by some transformations? Edit I figured it out - I don't have to use Euler's fraction for the exponential function, I can just use Euler's fraction for $\cos(x)$, which can be made directly from its Taylor series. $$\cos(x)=\cfrac{1}{1+\cfrac{x^2}{2-x^2+\cfrac{2x^2}{12-x^2+\cfrac{12x^2}{30-x^2+\cdots}}}}$$ It obviously converges much faster, because it contains $x^2$, not $x$. The $n^{th}$ coefficient is defined by the rule: $$\frac{(2n)!}{(2n-2)!}$$ As a result for $\phi$ we get: $$\phi=\cfrac{2}{1+\cfrac{\pi^2/25}{2-\pi^2/25+\cfrac{2\pi^2/25}{12-\pi^2/25+\cfrac{12\pi^2/25}{30-\pi^2/25+\cdots}}}}$$ I'm not able to use Mathematica right now, but I will check how speed and error compares to the other two continued fractions. But at least up to $n=4$ we have $\phi=1.618034$ which is correct for $5$ digits. As for the comment below due to Thomas Andrews ""...it is not surprising that continued fractions that allow coefficients outside the positive integers ""converge faster.""

For example, using the trigonometric representation of the golden ratio, we can express it as: $$\phi=2 \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{5} \right)=\Re (e^{-i \frac{\pi}{5}})$$ The convergents of $e^{-i \frac{\pi}{5}}$ can be calculated with the following procedure: $$ \begin{bmatrix}p_n \\ q_n \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 1 \\1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}1-i \frac{\pi}{5} & 1 \\i \frac{\pi}{5} & 0 \end{bmatrix} \dots \begin{bmatrix}n-1-i \frac{\pi}{5} & 1 \\(n-2)i \frac{\pi}{5} & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}n-i \frac{\pi}{5} \\(n-1)i \frac{\pi}{5} \end{bmatrix}  $$ $$\phi \approx \Re (\frac{p_n}{q_n})$$ Curiously, this continued fraction converges much faster, than the simple continued fraction for $\phi$: $$\phi=1+\cfrac{1}{1+\cfrac{1}{1+\cfrac{1}{1+\cdots}}}$$ For $20$ iterations we obtain the following error and computation time (in Mathematica). For Euler's continued fraction: $$t=0.00191546~s$$ $$\delta= 2.1295 \cdot 10^{-24}$$ For a simple continued fraction: $$t=0.000310476~s$$ $$\delta= -3.7325 \cdot 10^{-9}$$ As you can see despite the longer computation, Euler's continued fraction gives almost triple precision for the same number of terms compared to the simple continued fraction. Is this way of computing trigonometric functions used anywhere? Is there some continued fraction for trigonometric functions with faster convergence, or is this the best one? Maybe there is a way to further increase the convergence by some transformations? Edit I figured it out - I don't have to use Euler's fraction for the exponential function, I can just use Euler's fraction for $\cos(x)$, which can be made directly from its Taylor series. $$\cos(x)=\cfrac{1}{1+\cfrac{x^2}{2-x^2+\cfrac{2x^2}{12-x^2+\cfrac{12x^2}{30-x^2+\cdots}}}}$$ It obviously converges much faster, because it contains $x^2$, not $x$. The $n^{th}$ coefficient is defined by the rule: $$\frac{(2n)!}{(2n-2)!}$$ As a result for $\phi$ we get: $$\phi=\cfrac{2}{1+\cfrac{\pi^2/25}{2-\pi^2/25+\cfrac{2\pi^2/25}{12-\pi^2/25+\cfrac{12\pi^2/25}{30-\pi^2/25+\cdots}}}}$$ I'm not able to use Mathematica right now, but I will check how speed and error compares to the other two continued fractions. But at least up to $n=4$ we have $\phi=1.618034$ which is correct for $5$ digits.

Informally, I'll let $s_n$ denote a sum of $n$ trig functions and $p_n$ denote a product of $n$ trig functions. So the splitting example shown above would be expressed as: $$p_3 = (s_2)p_1 = p_2 + p_2 = s_2 + s_2 = s_4$$ Splitting a term of $6$ trig factors would then be expressed as: $$\begin{align} p_6 & = (s_2)p_4 = p_5 + p_5 = (s_2)p_3 + (s_2)p_3 = p_4 + p_4 + p_4 + p_4 \\ & = (s_2)p_2 + (s_2)p_2 + (s_2)p_2 + (s_2)p_2 = p_3 \times 8 = s_4 \times 8 \end{align}$$ In general, it appears that splitting a product of $n$ trig factors using product-to-sum formulas yields $2^{n-1}$ linear terms. Suppose I want to simplify the following expression: $$(\cos(3x) + \sin(5x) + \cos(7x) + \sin(11x))^6$$ The number of terms in the multinomial expansion is $\binom{6+4-1}{4-1} = 84$. Each term is a product of $6$ trig functions (since the exponents in each term must sum to $6$ according to multinomial theorem). As per the earlier formula, a product of $6$ trig functions splits into $32$ linear terms. Not counting the effect of power reduction (PR) formulae, $84 \cdot 32 = 2688$ linear terms. If my intuition is correct, the effect of PR is no better than product-to-sum conversions, because for each exponent that is cut in half, the entire enclosing term gets duplicated (since there are two terms in a PR formula). So roughly $\approx 2688$ terms is the best I know how to do. However, TrigReduce applied to same expression spits out a mere 59 linear sin/cos terms (!?!). How is this possible? Is Wolfram doing something tricky across the sums of the product strings? Would appreciate any clues. I know I've posted a few lame tumbleweeds lately; maybe my allowance of dumb questions is reaching a limit.
