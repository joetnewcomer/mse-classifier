16,Why am I allowed to assume x or y are equal to 0 in this Lagrange multipliers problem?,Why am I allowed to assume x or y are equal to 0 in this Lagrange multipliers problem?,,"I am working on a Lagrange multipliers problem where I have to find the extreme values of the function $f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2$ along the constraint curve $g(x, y) = x^4 + y^4 = 1$. Solving the Lagrange equations I get $\lambda = \frac{1}{2x^2}$ and $\lambda = \frac{1}{2y^2}$ i.e. $x = \pm y$. However, when plugging this result back into the constraint curve and solving for $g(x, y)$, I only get one extreme value, $\sqrt{2}$. Solutions for this problem say that when you obtain the Lagrange equations you can also assume that $x$ or $y$ are equal to $0$. And when you plug these results back into the constraint curve, you get a minimum of $1$ when one of the variables equals $0$ and the other equals $\pm 1$. What I am curious about is why exactly you are able to assume the $x$ or $y$ are equal to $0$ in this situation. My textbook says nothing about it and I can't find any examples of a problem where someone explains this. (The solution I found just assumed $x$ or $y$ equaled $0$ without any explanation.)

Solving the Lagrange equations I get $\lambda = \frac{1}{2x^2}$ and $\lambda = \frac{1}{2y^2}$ i.e. $x = \pm y$. However, when plugging this result back into the constraint curve and solving for $g(x, y)$, I only get one extreme value, $\sqrt{2}$. Solutions for this problem say that when you obtain the Lagrange equations you can also assume that $x$ or $y$ are equal to $0$. And when you plug these results back into the constraint curve, you get a minimum of $1$ when one of the variables equals $0$ and the other equals $\pm 1$.

Solving for $y$ I get: $y$ $=$ $\pm$ 2$\lambda$$\sqrt{3}$ I then plugged $y$ into the $x$ value I solved for in my first step: $x$ $=$ $\frac{yz}{2\lambda}$ and obtained: $x$ $=$ $\pm$ $\sqrt{3}z$ From here I am lost. I can't seem to do anything to get the rest of the values and get numerical values. I would like my process addressed first and then suggestions, and by that I mean answering the question is there a way to proceed down the same route that I am going or was my process flawed from the start? The book gives the answer exactly as follows:  maximum $\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}$, minimum $\frac{-2}{\sqrt{3}}$. What does that even mean when checking my answers I am used to $f$($x,y,z$) $=$ $c$. I'm guessing that in this instance they are just giving me c. Thank you",,"['multivariable-calculus', 'optimization', 'lagrange-multiplier']"
