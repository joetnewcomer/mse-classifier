63,Terminology re: continuity of discrete $a\sin(t)$,Terminology re: continuity of discrete,a\sin(t),"This question is specifically about the terminology used to explain a particular problem and its solution, not the math itself. I am a programmer, I am not really a math person, but I have at least an intuitive understanding of the concepts I frequently encounter in computer graphics. Recently a friend was doing some computer animation work that involved a sine wave with an amplitude and period that were functions of time. Let's call value $V$, amplitude $a$, period $p$, time $t$. He ran into a classic problem where he was doing: $$ V(t)=a(t)\sin\left(\frac{2\pi t}{p(t)}\right) $$ With $t$ set to the elapsed time since the start of the program, i.e. $t=t_\text{now}-t_\text{start}$. The problem, of course, is that as $p(t)$ changed, all sorts of artifacts were visible and the sine wave did not smoothly transition in apparent speed. He asked how to solve this problem. I explained to him that he instead needed to work with the current phase instead of absolute time, incrementing each frame based on the period, like so (initializing $t$ to 0): $$ t = t + \frac{\Delta t}{p(t)} $$ $$ V(t)=a(t)\sin(2\pi t) $$ Then I awkwardly launched into some explanation (that ultimately required a pen and paper) about how you want to ""smoothly move around the circle, incrementing so that changes in speed don't jump to far away positions"" rather than ""jumping between graphs of sine waves of different frequencies"" or something. In the end he got it, and fortunately he intuitively understood what I was trying to say, but I did a really poor job of explaining it. So my first question is, and apologies if this is asking too much, but how would you explain this to somebody, succinctly, using proper math terms? I realize there are many answers, but currently I know 0 answers. How can I explain to somebody why incrementing the phase based on $\Delta{t}$ and $p(t)$ leads to continuity, while calculating the value based on the total elapsed time doesn't? My second question is this: My friend then asked me, ""do I need to do the same with amplitude?"" The answer is no (assume that the ""continuity"" of $a(t)$ is ""good enough""). I couldn't explain why, though. I mean, intuitively, I knew why, and I said, ""No. I don't know the math term for it but the $a(t)$ is outside the $\sin()$ so it works out."" What are the words I was looking for there? How can I explain to somebody that $a(t)$ doesn't suffer the same problem as the $t/p(t)$ did? I know it has something to do with the way $\sin(x)$ varies with $x$, but I don't know the proper way to describe it. My third question is that at some point during this process I was explaining why the two equations above were identical for a constant $p(t)$. My explanation involved something like, ""Well, I mean, the elapsed time is the same as all of the delta times added together, so you can see if you pull these terms out of the $\sin()$ and increment instead, the value is the same."" Even typing that, it makes very little, if any, sense. On paper I wrote: The original: $$t=t_\text{now}-t_\text{start}$$ $$\sin\left(\frac{2\pi t}{p(t)}\right)$$ Is the same as: $$t=t+\Delta t$$ $$\sin\left(\frac{2\pi t}{p(t)}\right)$$ Is the same as: $$t=t+\frac{\Delta t}{p(t)}$$ $$\sin\left(2\pi t\right)$$ When $p(t)$ is a constant function. ... but I couldn't explain why . How can I explain to somebody that incrementing by deltas every frame is the same as the difference between the current frame and the first frame? Is there some terminology that fully encapsulates this so that an example is not necessary? Heck, I don't even know what the fundamental problem is called, I always just refer to it as an ""artifact"" in a generic sense. How would you explain this problem and its solution to somebody? Note: I realize I am liberally interchanging ""time"" (i.e. seconds) and ""phase"" above -- this is really just another symptom of my inability to express these thoughts clearly. Update: I have created two JavaScript demos that try and illustrate the problem: Example 1: Period is linear function of x (i.e. time) Example 2: Period is step function of x (i.e. time) Sorry, the examples are no longer online (11/11/15). The first example is a more typical case in my experience. The second example shows the problem very sharply and may be more illustrative. Basically, my question is: How could I explain why the incorrect approach is incorrect, and why the correct approach is correct, without using pictures or animated examples, but instead with proper and clear mathematical language?","This question is specifically about the terminology used to explain a particular problem and its solution, not the math itself.

94,What is the number of all possible relations/intersections of n sets?,What is the number of all possible relations/intersections of n sets?,,"If n defines number of sets, what is the number of all possible relations between them? For example, when n = 2: 1) A can intersect with B 2) A and B can be disjoint 3) A can be subset of B 4) B can be subset of A that leaves us with 4 possible relations. Now with the n = 3 it gets tricker (A can intersect with B, but not C or B can be subsect of C and intersect with A there etc). Wondering if there's any formula that can be made to calculate such possible relations. Working on this problem for last couple of days, read about Venn diagrams, Karnaugh map, but still can't figure that one out. Any help is appreciated!","If n defines number of sets, what is the number of all possible relations between them?

96,Karatsuba Multiplication,Karatsuba Multiplication,,Karatsuba's equation to reduce the amount of time it takes in brute force multiplication is as follows (I believe this is a divide-and-conquer algorithm): $$ x y = 10^n(ac) + 10^{n/2}(ad + bc) + bd $$ My question is this.
