In (V), I am having trouble parsing the integral $$ \int_1^\infty \frac{d \theta(x)}{x^s}. $$ What does the notation $d \theta(x)$ mean? Is $\theta(x)$ the variable of integration in some sense? If so, how? (This may be a naive question.) In the lower bound for $\theta(x)$ (on p. 707), in the bounds for the first summation -- $x^{1-\epsilon} \leq p \leq xx$ -- is $xx$ a typo, supposed to be $x$, or is it correct?

It is quite complex (pun not intended) and I called Mathematica in to aid me. I am calculating an energy of a system (which must be real-valued) and getting a complex result. The integration (done by Mathematica, which formally chooses the logarithm's branch cut as $]-\infty,0]$) yields $2\pi (i \pi + 3 \ln{(-r)})$ With that branch cut, $\ln{(-r)} = \ln{|r|} + i\pi, (r>0)$, which results in a remaining imaginary term. The question I have is: is it allowed to ""re-choose"" the logarithms branch cut when evaluating the seemingly independent problem of evaluating the logarithm of a negative number, just so, that instead of a imaginary $i\pi$, I get $-i\pi/3$, nicely cancelling with the other term in the expression?

Shouldn't the definition of square root function taught before defining ? and defining without   define as either is also very strange because we want  extended function to  be continuous and choosing will make this impossible although must be one of the two (after defining the square root of negatives). Why do we even care so much about continuity? (I am sure there is an answer is the rest of the book but I am still a beginner), all of this confusion will disappear if we just made , we seem all to agree to use in solving problems involving complex numbers,even wolfram alpha uses that and every high school math book and some engineering math books (I know the last know types of books lacks rigorousness in general but what I am saying is is seems normal to just define that way  ), so why all of that confusion? I asked some of my graduate friends and all of them told me the they just define without any of these complications. Now I am more confused, do we define or not?
