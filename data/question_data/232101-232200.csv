I saw someone named sets similiar to the S above ""R-paths"" (the difference being that they were using only finite sets); basically if S (the set above) was a relation on some set A ($S \subseteq A^2$) then S would be an infinite R-path (an example of finite R-path would be {(A, B), (B, C), (C, D)}). My question can be then reformulated: can we construct an infinite R-path (on any set)? My intuition is no, because at the path-point we got to after n steps, let's call it (N, M), the next path-point is either (M, not-the-end-point) or (M, end-point). The second option can't be right because we only traversed n path-points (and the path is infinite); but if first option is always right (that is, if the next step doesn't get us to the end), then there is no next-to-the-last path-point. This is probably useless since it only shows it is impossible to traverse (going one-by-one) such path (which was obvious from beginning), not that such path is impossible, but it might have to do with the actual annswer...

Here is my proof for $E \cap E^{c} = \varnothing$, where $E$ is a subset of some universe set $U$. For the $\subset$ part, we want to show that if $x \in E \cap E^{c}$, then $x \in \varnothing$. Let $x \in E \cap E^{c}$. It follows that $x$ is in both $E$ and $E^{c}$. However, if $x \in E$, $x \notin E^{c}$. Therefore the first part of the implication is false. Obviously the second part of the implication is false also (i.e. $x \in \varnothing$ is false). This implies that the statement if $x \in E \cap E^{c}$, then $x \in \varnothing$ is actually true vacuously . For the $\supset$ part, well again we can say that the statement is true vacuously. Therefore, we conclude that $E \cap E^{c} = \varnothing$. Q.E.D I feel uneasy because of all these vacuously true statements. So does this proof really hold?",,['elementary-set-theory']

How to prove $A=(A\setminus B)\cup (A\cap B)$. I have seen this problem and the solution is clear to me. Initially I was satisfied by my prove but now I think it is wrong.

98,A question on the generalization of Cartesian Product,A question on the generalization of Cartesian Product,,"In Halmos’s Book, it is written that, The notation of families is the one normally used in generalizing the concept of Cartesian product. The Cartesian product of two sets $X$ and $Y$ was defined as the set of all ordered pairs $(x,y)$ with $x$ in $X$ and $y$ in $Y$.  There is a natural one-to-one correspondence between this set and a certain set of families. Consider, indeed any particular unordered pair $\{a,b\}$ with $a\ne b$, and consider the set $Z$ of all families $z$, indexed by $\{a,b\}$, such that $z_a\in X$ and $z_b\in Y$. If the function $f$ from $Z$ to $X\times Y$ is defined by $f(z)=(z_a,z_b)$, then $f$ is the promised one-to-one correspondence. Till this portion I think I understand (I have quoted this portion so that my next quote doesn't seem abrupt. If anyone has a problem with it, he/she is welcome to remove it.). In fact, I think that I can prove the one-to-one correspondence also which follows trivially from the definition of ordered pairs. However, the portion that I cannot understand is the following, The difference between $Z$ and $X\times Y$ is merely a matter of notation. ... . The generalization is now straightforward. If $\{X_i\}$ is a family of sets $(i\in I)$, the Cartesian product of the family is, by definition the set of all families $\{x_i\}$ with $x_i\in X_i$ for each $i$ in I. Why in the first line it is said that the difference between $Z$ and $X\times Y$ is “merely” a matter of notation? Also, I don’t understand anything from the rest portion of the quote. In fact, I think that I am having trouble understanding the portion mainly because of the fact that I am unable to construct examples. Can anyone elaborate the second passage with examples?","In Halmos’s Book, it is written that, The notation of families is the one normally used in generalizing the concept of Cartesian product.
