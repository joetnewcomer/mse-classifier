I expect the results to behave similarly to $e^{x^2}=\sum_{k\ge 0}\frac{x^{2k}}{k!}$ . However, I'm not quite sure how to develop the leading asymptotics of the integrals. I first thought that for large $x$ , the integral should be dominated by its integral over a small ball around the maximum of the integrand $\frac{e^{2z\log x}}{\Gamma(1+z)}$ . To find this maximum, I computed $$f'(z)=\left(2\log(x)-\psi^{(0)}(1+z)\right)f(z)$$ with $\psi^{(0)}(z)$ the logarithmic derivative of $\Gamma(z)$ . Since $f$ never vanishes, the maximum must occur at $z\in(0,\infty)$ such that $\psi^{(0)}(1+z)=2\log x$ . Assuming that we will take $x\to\infty$ as well as the asymptotics $\psi(z)=\log z +O(1/z)$ for large and positive $z$ , we seek to solve $2\log x= \log(1+z) +O(1/z)$ .

72,Surface integral via differential forms,Surface integral via differential forms,,"I am trying to figure out why the change of variables formulas for surface integrals (for example) is what it is. I was wondering if there is a justification in terms of differential forms. So, let $g : V \to \mathbb{R}$ be a smooth function, andlet $S$ be the surface given by $G(V)$, where $G(x, y) = (x, y, g(x, y))$. In my current predicament, $V$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$, but supposedly 2 may be replaced with general $n$. Let $F : S \to \mathbb{R}$ be a smooth function. I found the following formula online: $$ \int_S F\,  dS = \int_V (F\circ G)\sqrt{g_x^2 + g_y^2 + 1}\ dA. $$ Here $dA = dx \wedge dy$ is the standard area form. I have a few questions about this. Could someone recommend a rigorous proof of this fact, or perhaps a proof sketch? I am familiar with the change of variables formula when we are considering a change of variables by a diffeomorphism between open sets in $\mathbb{R}^n$, but this seems to fall apart here (since $S$ is not open in $\mathbb{R}^3$).

Any help is much appreciated.","I am trying to figure out why the change of variables formulas for surface integrals (for example) is what it is. I was wondering if there is a justification in terms of differential forms. So, let $g : V \to \mathbb{R}$ be a smooth function, andlet $S$ be the surface given by $G(V)$, where $G(x, y) = (x, y, g(x, y))$. In my current predicament, $V$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$, but supposedly 2 may be replaced with general $n$. Let $F : S \to \mathbb{R}$ be a smooth function. I found the following formula online: $$ \int_S F\,  dS = \int_V (F\circ G)\sqrt{g_x^2 + g_y^2 + 1}\ dA. $$ Here $dA = dx \wedge dy$ is the standard area form. I have a few questions about this.

81,Problem using trigonometric substitution $x = a \sec θ$ and domain of $\theta$,Problem using trigonometric substitution  and domain of,x = a \sec θ \theta,"I'm studying calculus from Rogawski's Calculus. In trigonometric substitution $x=a\sec \theta$ , he made a note: In the substitution $x = a \sec θ$ , we choose $0\le  θ \le \frac π 2$ if $x \ge a$ and $π \le θ < \frac{3π}2$ if $x \le −a$ . With these choices, $a \tan \theta$ is the positive square root $\sqrt{x^2 − a^2}$ . When I work on the integral: $$\int \frac {\mathrm{d}x}{x\sqrt{x^2-9}}$$ Using the substitution of $x=3\sec\theta$ with the domain of $\theta$ shown above, the integration will be : $$\int \frac {dx}{x\sqrt{x^2-9}}= \int \frac {3\sec\theta\tan\theta d\theta}{(3\sec\theta)\sqrt{9\sec^2-9}}=\int \frac {\tan\theta d\theta}{3\sqrt{\tan^2 \theta}}\\= \int \frac{d\theta}{3}= \frac\theta 3+ \mathrm{C}= \frac 13 \sec^{-1}\left(\frac x3\right)+ \mathrm{C}$$ which is very wrong in the negative part of the domain of $x$ , as shown in the graph below. The slope of the blue function in the negative domain should be positive not negative!. There are 2 thoughts with this substitution: $1)$ The problem with the domain of $\theta \in (\pi,\frac{3\pi}2) $ is that inverse-substitution cannot be done, because $\theta =\sec^{-1}x\notin  (\pi,\frac{3\pi}2) $ . $2)$ Given the problem in (1), we should choose $\theta \in (0,\pi)-\{\frac\pi 2\}$ which makes $\sqrt{\tan^2 \theta}=|\tan \theta|$ .

But trying to do the following in spherical coordinates failed: $$\int_0^{2\pi}{\vec{r}d\phi}=\int_0^{2\pi}{(r,\theta,\phi)d\phi} = {2\pi(r,\theta,\pi)} $$ Which is completely wrong... What am I doing wrong?","How to integrate a vector function in spherical coordinates? In my specific case, it's an electric field on the axis of charged ring (see image below),  the integral is pretty easy, but I don't understand how handle the vector $(r,\theta,\phi)$ while integrating over $\phi$. I tried the following: $$\vec{E}=\int\limits_{Q}{\frac{kdq}{\|\vec{r}\|^3}\vec{r}}$$ $$ =\int_0^{2\pi}{\frac{k\lambda  \vec{r}sin\theta d\phi}{\|\vec{r}\|^3}\vec{r}}$$ $$ =\int_0^{2\pi}{\frac{k\lambda Rd\phi}{\|\vec{r}\|^3}\vec{r}}$$ $$ =\frac{k\lambda R}{\|\vec{r}\|^3}\int_0^{2\pi}{\vec{r}d\phi} $$ Now, if I convert $\vec{r}$ to $(x,y,z)$ coordinates and integrate it's ok: $$\int_0^{2\pi}{\vec{r}d\phi}=\int_0^{2\pi}{r(sin\theta cos\phi,sin\theta sin\phi,cos\theta)d\phi} = 2\pi r(0,0,cos\theta)=2\pi z\hat{z} $$ Putting it in the original expression will give the correct result.

97,How to use Stokes theorem?,How to use Stokes theorem?,,Use Stokes theorem to evaluate $\int_{C} [ydx+y^{2}dy+(x+2z)dz]$ where $C$ is the curve of intersection of the sphere $x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=a^{2}$ and the plane $y+z=a$ oriented counterclockwise as viewed from above. I can't seem to understand the examples in the book. Can someone explain to me what this means and how to apply Stokes formula? EDIT: I still dont understand what exactly hes talking about i have figured out wha ti am supposed to take the curl of at least (now that i know what thing the curl is suppsoed to be taken on). Curl F =  (0)dydz-(-1)dxdz+(-1)dxdy from wha ti have been able to decifer i think n is supposed to be the vertor normal to the 2 sufaces  $x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=a^{2}$ and $y+z=a$ in which case $n=\begin{bmatrix} e_{1}&e_{2}&e_{3} \\ 0&1&1 \\ 2x&2y&2z\\ \end{bmatrix}$ $n=(2z-2y)i+(2x)j-(2z)k$ thus $\int\int_{S}2xdxdz+2xdxdy$ $=(x^{2}z+x^{2}y)||_{S}$ which again makes no sense when i calculate K below i get 1-1=0 which also makes no sense,Use Stokes theorem to evaluate $\int_{C} [ydx+y^{2}dy+(x+2z)dz]$ where $C$ is the curve of intersection of the sphere $x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=a^{2}$ and the plane $y+z=a$ oriented counterclockwise as viewed from above.
