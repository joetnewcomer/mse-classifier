6,Involution centralizer of perfect group with quaternion Sylow 2-subgroups,Involution centralizer of perfect group with quaternion Sylow 2-subgroups,,"Exercise 7.11 of  Kurzweil–Stellmacher asks me to: Prove that the centralizer of an involution is nonsolvable inside any perfect group with generalized quaternion Sylow 2-subgroups of order at least 16. I would like to oblige, but I'm having trouble getting much of a handle on the centralizer itself, rather than just its action. The center T=⟨t⟩ of a quaternion group is weakly closed, and so the normalizer X=N G (T)=C G (t) of T in that perfect group G controls G-fusion within any Sylow 2-subgroup P that happens to contain T. The only fusion possible on P in a perfect group is the ""full"" fusion where all (both classes of) quaternion subgroups of order 8 are acted on by their full automorphism group (and otherwise no fusion beyond that induced by P itself). So I know X contains at least two copies of SL(2,3) and X/Z contains at least two copies of S4.  Since G is perfect, P = [P,X] ≤ [X,X].  I think the copies of SL(2,3) pairwise intersect in a particular cyclic subgroup of P of order 4. More precisely: If Q is a quaternion subgroup of P of order 8, then Y=N X (Q) contains SL(2,3) and Y/Z contains S4.  [Y,Q] ≥ Q.  P is generated by its [T:Q] quaternion subgroups of order 8, so also by its [Y,Q]s.  The intersection of any pair of distinct Qs is the order 4 cyclic subgroup of the (unique) maximal subgroup that happens to be cyclic. So it is a special configuration that has to fit lots of solvable groups inside, but I don't see any particular reason the result could not be solvable.  The closest thing to nonsolvable I get is that the derived length of N has to be at least 3. I get roughly the same results for a quaternion Sylow of order 8, except one only has the single SL(2,3).  I have not found a perfect G with solvable X in this case, but of course I can if I only require the same fusion pattern, since SL(2,3) and SL(2,5) have the same 2-fusion. More: With a little reminder from reading the work of Bender's students, I can now do this using Brauer–Suzuki or Z*, but this does not seem much like a homework solution. The truth seems to be X⋅O(G)=G, and every non-trivial quotient of a perfect group is perfect, so the homomorphic image G/O(G) of X is perfect.  Since G has Sylow 2-subgroups, G/O(G) is non-identity, so X has a non-identity perfect quotient, so X is nonsolvable. I'm not sure how to show X⋅O(G)=G without using tools significantly beyond chapter 7. Smaller question: I vaguely recall Suzuki proved that if G is a perfect group with no non-identity normal subgroups of odd order and with quaternion Sylow 2-subgroups, then each coset of C G (t) contains exactly one conjugate of t, where t is an involution.  In other words, if the product of two involutions centralizes t, then that product is the identity. Can someone prove this with ideas from K–S up to chapter 7? This is hard for me to check since in reality such a group has exactly one involution t and G = C G (t), but that comes later in my solution.","Exercise 7.11 of  Kurzweil–Stellmacher asks me to: Prove that the centralizer of an involution is nonsolvable inside any perfect group with generalized quaternion Sylow 2-subgroups of order at least 16.

9,The division algebras arising in the Wedderburn decomposition of a finite group modulo its radical in characteristic $p$,The division algebras arising in the Wedderburn decomposition of a finite group modulo its radical in characteristic,p,"The following question is probably straightforward for those who know.  However, I am used to working either over splitting fields or in characteristic zero. Question. Let $G$ be a finite group and $k$ a field of characteristic $p>0$.  The quotient $kG/rad(kG)$ decomposes as a direct product of matrix rings over division algebras, finite dimensional over $k$.  What can be said about these division algebras? If $D$ is one of these division algebras, is it true that $p$ does not divide the dimension of $D$ over its center? I sort of convinced myself that in fact these division algebras must be fields in characteristic $p$ (and hence what I want is true), but since I couldn't find this stated anywhere, I suspect there is a flaw in my logic.

Since finite division rings are fields and $F_p$ is perfect, we have that $F_pG/rad(F_pG)\cong \prod_{i=1}^m M_{n_i}(L_i)$ where the $L_i$ are finite separable extensions of $F_p$.

However, I am used to working either over splitting fields or in characteristic zero. Question. Let $G$ be a finite group and $k$ a field of characteristic $p>0$.

If $D$ is one of these division algebras, is it true that $p$ does not divide the dimension of $D$ over its center?

41,Structure of the Brainball group,Structure of the Brainball group,,"This is a Brainball : It consists of $13$ numbered pieces arranged in a ring and a core; each piece has one side white and one side yellow. Part of the core, the blue caps in the picture above, can flip two groups of $3$ and $4$ pieces at once like pancakes, on opposite sides of the ring; the solved position has the white faces of $1$ to $13$ running clockwise on the same side. Scherphuis's website gives the number of positions as $2^{12}\cdot12!$ by noting a parity restriction (parity of piece permutation equals parity of number of yellow tiles you see) and treating positions differing by a ring twist as equal. We can effectively ""quotient out"" both restrictions by fixing piece $13$ and not turning the whole puzzle over (only twist the ring and the blue caps). The form of the puzzle and the form of the number of positions strongly suggests that the structure of the group $G$ of Brainball positions after quotienting out is the wreath product $C_2\wr S_{12}$ – my question here is on how to prove (or disprove) this. $G$ has $13$ generators corresponding to the positions of piece $13$ relative to the blue caps when doing a flip.

Similarly, the edge orientation restriction can be interpreted as taking a group homomorphism from the larger group to (taking the corresponding permutation of edge stickers), and then again composing with the sign homomorphism to , and taking the kernel. What's left is the restriction on corner orientation.  I have seen descriptions of corresponding functions from the larger group to ; what is not clear to me is whether any of these functions gives a homomorphism of groups.

IDEA: You want to hold up a painting using nails on a wall and string. The string is attached to the left and right sides of the painting and the nails are in between (let's say in a horizontal straight line for simplicity). QUESTION: The object is to find ways of doing this to satisfy various requirements. For example, so that if any one nail is taken out, it will fall. Or so that if any two nails (but not one) are taken out it will fall. In particular, I want to find short solutions or even a method to construct all possible solutions. Basically, what exactly is the mathematical structure and what are the main results or whatever. VISUALS: Here I use capitals for the inverses. THEORY: First nomenclature. Let's say we have three nails: $a$, $b$ and $c$. If we pass over the first nail rightwards, we call that $a$, but if we go over it leftwards, we call that $a^{-1}$. Then if we conatenate or multiply them, it means we do one after another. So for example, $abc$ corresponds to the string going across over the top of all the three nails from left to right. In that case, all three nails would need to be removed before the painting fell. Something like $aba^{-1}$ means it's looped around $b$ but sort of hanging on $a$ as well. Only $b$ needs to be removed for it to fall. Obviously $aa^{-1}$ cancels out. And $a^5$ means a bunch of loops. Removing a nail simply means removing all of its appearances in the formula. The painting will fall if the whole thing reduces to the identity. Eg) $bca^{-1}cac$ becomes $bc^3$ if the $a$ nail is taken out. Perhaps the most powerful tool I've found is that you can use a kind of conjugation as an ""or"" operator. It entangles the two parts. For example, $aba^{-1}b^{-1}$ will fall if either $a$ or $b$ are removed. The complement ""and"" operator is just multiplication.

I'm curious about when $\mathbb{F}_{p^k}^{\times} \cong \mathbb{Z}_m^{\times}$ . Two relevant and well known results are: The group of units of a finite field is cyclic . $\mathbb{Z}_m^{\times}$ is cyclic iff $m=2, 4, q^k$ or $2q^k$ where $q$ is an odd prime and $k \geq 1$ . For $k=1$ , we get a solution whenever $|\mathbb{Z}_m^{\times}| = \varphi(m) = p-1$ and $\mathbb{Z}_m^{\times}$ is cyclic (by the first result and since cyclic groups of the same order are isomorphic). Then by the second result, $m=p$ and $m=2p$ are the only such values where $p$ is a prime. For $k>1$ , by the first and second result we need to find $\mathbb{F}_{p^k}^{\times} \cong \mathbb{Z}_{q^s}^{\times} \cong \mathbb{Z}_{2q^s}^{\times}$ for an odd prime $q$ . And since cyclic groups of the same order are isomorphic, it suffices to have $|\mathbb{F}_{p^k}^{\times}| =|\mathbb{Z}_{q^s}^{\times}|$ . Thus, we get the diophantine equation $p^k - 1 = q^s - q^{s-1}$ which has solutions for odd primes $p,q$ iff $\mathbb{F}_{p^k}^{\times} \cong \mathbb{Z}_{q^s}^{\times} \cong \mathbb{Z}_{2q^s}^{\times}$ . One might suspect that this would not have solutions, but there is this one: $7^3 - 1 = 19^2 - 19 \implies \mathbb{F}_{7^3}^{\times} \cong \mathbb{Z}_{19^2}^{\times} \cong \mathbb{Z}_{2 \cdot19^2}^{\times}$ I've checked for $p, q, k, s \leq 300$ and this appears to be the only such solution. I have tried to prove this and have a few very partial results. For instance, any solution must satisfy the following conditions: $q > p \iff (p-1) \lvert (q-1)$ This follows fairly easily after reducing modulo $p-1$ . $q^{s-1} < p^k < q^s$ Since $p^k - 1 = q^s - q^{s-1} < q^s$ and we cannot have $p^k = q^s$ for distinct primes $p, q$ so, $p^k < q^s$ . For the other inequality, $p^k > p^k - 1 = q^s - q^{s-1} = q^{s-1}(q-1) > q^{s-1}$ . Any suggestions how one can show that $p^k - 1 = q^s - q^{s-1}$ has no solutions with $k > 1$ beyond $(p, q, k, s) = (7, 19, 3, 2)$ ? EDIT (22/10/23): This ""proof"" is currently wrong, but I will keep it here for future reference (see comments) I believe we can show $s=2$ for any solution. Let $s > 1$ . Since $(p-1) \lvert (q-1)$ , we of course get that $t := \frac{q-1}{p-1}$ is an integer. Writing the equation as, $$p^k - 1 = q^{s-1}(q - 1)$$ factoring, $$(p-1)(1 + p + \cdots + p^{k-1}) = q^{s-1}(q-1)$$ $$(1 + p + \cdots + p^{k-1}) = q^{s-1} \frac{q-1}{p-1}$$ $$(1 + p + \cdots + p^{k-1}) = q^{s-1} t = q^{s-2} \cdot qt$$ We want to show that $GCD(1 + p + \cdots + p^{k-1}, q^{s-2}) = 1$ . Otherwise, we would get that $1 + p + \cdots + p^{k-1} = q^r$ for $r \leq s-2 \implies p^{k-1} < q^r \leq q^{s-2}$ . We also have, $p^k > p^k - 1 = q^s - q^{s-1} > q^{s-1}$ since $q > 2$ . Putting these together, we get that $p^{k-1} < q^{s-2} < q^{s-1} < p^k$ which is a contradiction since $q > p$ . Thus, $GCD(1 + p + \cdots + p^{k-1}, q^{s-2}) = 1$ and since $1 + p + \cdots + p^{k-1} = q^{s-2} \cdot qt$ we have, $$q^{s-2} = 1 \implies s = 2$$ .","Let denote the group of units of a finite field, and let denote the group of units modulo some integer .

This actually happens when $G = D_{32}$, the dihedral group of order $32$, so proving that $|G'| = p^3$ is impossible is not the way to go.

97,Why are Lie groups automatically analytic manifolds?,Why are Lie groups automatically analytic manifolds?,,"In the book by Kolar, Michor, and Slovak, it is shown that multiplication $\mu:G\times G\to G$ is analytic in some neighborhood of $e$. Specifically, they show that in the chart given by $\exp^{-1}$, with domain some neighborhood of the origin, multiplication is real analytic. They claim that it follows that $\mu$ is analytic on all of $G$. By this, I think they mean there always exists a real analytic structure on $G$ in which $\mu$ is everywhere analytic. Could someone please supply the details? I'm assuming the thought is to push this neighborhood of analyticity around the group by using the multiplication map and the fact that a Lie group is generated by any neighborhood of $e$. However, this is only true for connected Lie groups, so this approach would fail for e.g. $\mathrm{O}(n)$, $n>2$.","In the book by Kolar, Michor, and Slovak, it is shown that multiplication $\mu:G\times G\to G$ is analytic in some neighborhood of $e$.

99,"What rational numbers are expressible as ""multiple-of-$12$"" continued fractions?","What rational numbers are expressible as ""multiple-of-"" continued fractions?",12,"I need to use a special subclass of continued fraction expansions for a problem I'm studying. Namely, expansions of the form $$[a_0;a_1;a_2;\dotsc; a_{n}] = a_0+\displaystyle\frac{1}{a_1+\displaystyle\frac{1}{a_2+\displaystyle\frac{1}{\ddots\displaystyle\frac{1}{a_n}}}}$$ where $a_0,\dotsc, a_{n-1}\in 12\mathbb{Z}$ and $a_n\in S\subset\mathbb{Q}\cup\{\infty\}$ , a finite subset of the extended rationals. This problem is in analogue to the ""even continued fraction expansions"", which have $a_0,\dotsc, a_{n-1}\in 2\mathbb{Z}$ and $a_n\in\{0,1,\infty\}$ . It turns out that the set of even continued fraction expansions is just all of $\mathbb{Q}\cup\{\infty\}$ . The proof uses the projectivized congruence level $2$ subgroup ${\rm P}\Gamma(2)$ , which is generated by the Möbius transformations $$A: z\mapsto \frac{z}{-2z+1}\text{ and }B: z\mapsto z+2.$$ I've seen it claimed in various places (but never with proof) that the (left) action of ${\rm P\Gamma}(2) = \langle A, B\rangle$ on $\mathbb{Q}\cup\{\infty\}$ has orbit transversal $\{0,1,\infty\}$ , meaning that for each $r/s\in\mathbb{Q}\cup\{\infty\}$ there is a word $w\in \langle A,B\rangle$ such that $r/s = w.x$ for some $x\in\{0,1,\infty\}$ . Determining an even continued fraction expansion for $r/s$ from there is then simply a matter of decoding the corresponding word $w$ . Now, my questions: is there any hope of a similar result holding in the ""multiple-of- $12$ "" expansion case? Namely, could there be some finite set $S$ such that expansions of that form describe all of $\mathbb{Q}\cup\{\infty\}$ ? Equivalently, if $G$ is the group generated by the transformations $$a: z\mapsto z+12, \quad b:z\mapsto -z,\quad c:z\mapsto 1/z,$$ does the action of $G$ on $\mathbb{Q}\cup\{\infty\}$ have a finite orbit transversal? And how would such an orbit transversal be calculated, finite or not? This seems like a pretty tough/niche problem, so even just pointing me in the direction of some references would be greatly appreciated. Edit: I gave both $b$ and $c$ as valid transformations since I happen to have those symmetries in the context I'm working in, but if one needs to restrict this to just $z\mapsto -1/z$ so that $G$ is a subset of ${\rm PSL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ , then that is fine.","I need to use a special subclass of continued fraction expansions for a problem I'm studying.
