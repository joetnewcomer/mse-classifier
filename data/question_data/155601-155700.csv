1,Another proof of Wilson's theorem,Another proof of Wilson's theorem,,"Here is a list of the proof of Wilson's theorem, $\prod_{i=1}^{p-1}i=-1\bmod p$ , which I know. Do you know any other proof? 1: $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ is a cyclic group for multiplication. The order is $p-1$ . Thus, by using the generator, $g$ , and Fermat's little theorem, we get $\prod_{i=1}^{p-1}i=g^{0+1+...+p-1}\equiv g^{p(p-1)/2}\equiv g^{(p-1)/2}\equiv-1$ . 2: From Fermat's little theorem and factor theorem, $(x-1)...(x-p+1)=x^{p-1}-1 \bmod p$ is satisfied for any $x\in\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ . By comparing the constant term, we get Wilson's theorem. 3: Since $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ is group for multiplication, for any $a\in\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ except $a=1,p-1$ , we can make a pair $(a,a^{-1})$ s.t. $a \not\equiv a^{-1}\in\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ . Thus, we get Wilson's theorem. 4: Using $a(p-a)\equiv -a^2\bmod p$ , we get $\prod_{i=1}^{p-1}i\equiv\prod_{i=1}^{(p-1)/2}(-i^2)$ . From Euler's criterion and factor theorem, for any $x\in\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ , $\prod_{i=1}^{(p-1)/2}(x-i^2)\equiv x^{(p-1)/2}-1$ is satisfied. Thus, by comparing constant term, we get Wilson's theorem. 5: Consider $p$ vertices placed on a circle at regular intervals. Then the number of ways to make a Hamilton cycle is $(p-1)!$ . The number of graphs which does not change even if we rotate it by $2\pi/p$ is $p-1$ . Thus, the number of graphs which will change by rotating $2\pi/p$ is $(p-1)!-(p-1)$ . If we collect graphs which will match each other by rotating $(2\pi/p)\mathbb{Z}$ from this $(p-1)!-(p-1)$ graphs, the size of the set is $p$ . Thus we get $(p-1)!-(p-1)\equiv0\bmod p$ .

Since there is a bigger chance of finding B-smooth values when $f(x)$ is small, it is beneficial to only look at the start of the waves. I noticed that most of the time $f(x)<\sqrt{N}$ in those locations, and by experiment I found a formula to get those values. $$f_{min}(x)=\lceil\frac{\lceil\sqrt{(a-b+1)^2+4(xN-a)}\rceil+(a-b+1)}{2}\rceil+\lceil\sqrt{N}\rceil$$ $a = f(0)$ $b = f(1)$ Edit: tnx to Tob Ernack that notice that $f_{min}(x)$ can be reduced to $$f_{min}(x)=\lceil\sqrt{Nx}\rceil$$ Note that $\mod{N}$ been removed and it still works $f(f_{min}(x))$ will be either the start or the end location of the wave (if it is the end, then the next value is the start) So my question is Why does the formula work? Edit: Here is another interesting observation: $f(a) < f(b)$ iff $\lceil\sqrt{Na}\rceil^2-Na<\lceil\sqrt{Nb}\rceil^2-Nb$ Here are example values: $N=296629285609=570043\cdot 520363$ $\lceil\sqrt{N}\rceil=544637$ $f(f_{min}(0)) = 176160$ $f(f_{min}(1)+1) = 303071$ $f(f_{min}(2)+1) = 612094$ $f(f_{min}(3)+1) = 704640$ $f(f_{min}(4)+1) = 15980$ Here is the java code I use to evaluate this: private BigInteger nextJump(BigInteger a, BigInteger b, BigInteger index, BigInteger root) {         BigInteger abDif = a.subtract(b).add(ONE);         BigInteger difPower = abDif.pow(2);         return sqrCeil(                 difPower                         .add(V_4.multiply(N.multiply(index).subtract(a)))         )                 .add(abDif)                 .divide(TWO).add(root);     }      BigInteger lastY = TWO;      private BigInteger sqrCeil(BigInteger value) {         BigInteger y = lastY;         BigInteger result = value.divide(y);         while (true) {             BigInteger subtract = y.subtract(result);             if (subtract.abs().equals(BigInteger.ONE) || subtract.equals(ZERO)) {                 break;             }             y = result.add(y).divide(TWO);             result = value.divide(y);         }         lastY = y;         return y;     }",,"['number-theory', 'elementary-number-theory', 'modular-arithmetic', 'factoring', 'prime-factorization']"

would like to help finding counterexamples. Conjecture: For all odd numbers $n>159$ there are positive integers $a\le b$ such that: $\quad n=a+b$ $\quad a^2+b^2$ and $a^2+(b+2)^2$ are primes Let $S_n=\{a\in\mathbb Z^+|\exists b\in\mathbb Z^+:n=a+b\wedge a^2+b^2\in\mathbb P\}$. Below there is a list of $n$ and $S_n\cap S_{n+2}$, the set of the possible $a\,$ that fulfills the conjecture for the odd number $n$, $1<n<1000$ (0 denotes the empty set): 3 {1} 5 {1,2} 7 {2} 9 0  11

The prime number theorem tells us that if $\pi(x)=|\{p\in\mathscr P\colon p\leq x\}|$ then $\pi(x)\sim \frac{x}{\log x}$. Now one could think about the fact that $\mathbb Z$ is a Dedekind domain and $\mathscr P$ can be seen as the set of prime ideals in $\mathbb Z$. So the function $\pi(x)$ can be thought as a way of counting prime ideals whose norm is not greater than $x$. If $K$ is a number field, $\mathcal O_K$ its number ring and $\mathscr P_K$ the set of its prime ideals, we are in a very similar situation: we have a Dedekind domain and for each prime ideal $\mathfrak p\in \mathscr P_K$ the norm $N(\mathfrak p)$ of $\mathfrak p$ is well defined, being $|\mathcal O_K/\mathfrak p|$.

Would that be correct?

So the function $\pi(x)$ can be thought as a way of counting prime ideals whose norm is not greater than $x$. If $K$ is a number field, $\mathcal O_K$ its number ring and $\mathscr P_K$ the set of its prime ideals, we are in a very similar situation: we have a Dedekind domain and for each prime ideal $\mathfrak p\in \mathscr P_K$ the norm $N(\mathfrak p)$ of $\mathfrak p$ is well defined, being $|\mathcal O_K/\mathfrak p|$. Moreover, for each $n\in \mathbb N$ there is a finite number of (prime) ideals of norm $n$. So the question is: what can I say asymptotically about the function $\pi_K$ defined as $\pi_K(x)=|\{\mathfrak p\in \mathscr P_K\colon N(\mathfrak p)\leq x \}|$? For example if $K$ is a quadratic field, then there are $\pi(x)$ rational primes which are $\leq x$. Half of them remain prime in $K$ so they have norm $p^2$, so I expect them to contribute for $\pi(\sqrt{x})/2$ to $\pi_K(x)$, while the other half splits in $K$ in $2$ prime ideals each of which of norm $p$, so I am expecting this other half to contribute for $2\cdot \pi(x)/2=\pi(x)$ to $\pi_K(x)$. Would that be correct? And finally, if $A$ is any Dedekind domain such that there are only finitely many prime ideals of a fixed norm (is this always the case?), is there any kind of general result about $\pi_A(x)=|\{\mathfrak p\in \mathscr P_A\colon N(\mathfrak p)\leq x\}|$?",,"['number-theory', 'algebraic-number-theory', 'analytic-number-theory']"

95,What is the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture?,What is the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture?,,"This is probably a really silly question, but I was wondering if someone could explain the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture to me in a simple way. I've read a lot about it, but cannot understand it. Maybe posting here will help. What I do understand is the concept of ranks on an elliptic curve; for ever point that generates an infinite number of points on the elliptic curve, it contributes 1 to the rank. Further, I know that Mordell proved that every elliptic curve must have a finite rank. Finally, with regards to BSD, I understand that the conjecture says that the ""analytic"" way of computing the rank is the same as the ""algebraic"" way of computing the rank. But what I cannot seem to understand is what exactly is the analytic way of computing the rank, or the algebraic way. If anyone wants to help me out, that would be much appreciated!

98,Irrationality of $\sqrt{2m}$,Irrationality of,\sqrt{2m},"I have this problem: If $\sqrt{m}$ is irrational, and $m$ is odd, so: Is $\sqrt{2m}$ always irrational ? My thought was: I have a $m$ number, that can be of the form $(2n \pm 1)$ , that is square is irrational. To find a counterexample, I need this: $2m = x^2$ , then I need an integer, that have perfect square, divided in $2$ is an odd number, that is equal to: Lets $x$ any integer: $\frac{x^2}{2} = k$ Then, $k$ must be an integer, since it is divisible by 2 and must be a number of form $(2n \pm1)$ that is $m$ . With these conclusions, I can reform my problem to: Is there an perfect square, which is divisible by $2$ , and this division is an odd number? I do not ask this directly, because there may be an easier approach, but still this form seems very interesting to me.
