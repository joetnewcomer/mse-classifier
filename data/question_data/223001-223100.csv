In particular, one can consider the composition of functors $$\mathscr{C}\to \mathsf{PSh}(\mathscr{C})\xrightarrow{(-)^\#}\mathsf{Sh}(\mathscr{C})$$ (where $(-)^\#$ denotes sheafification) and think of the full image—the full subcategory of $\mathsf{Sh}(\mathscr{C})$ whose objects are sheaves isomorphic to $h_X^\#$ for an object $X$ of $\mathscr{C}$ .

78,The quotient scheme $X/\Gamma$ when $X$ is separated and every orbit is contained in an affine.,The quotient scheme  when  is separated and every orbit is contained in an affine.,X/\Gamma X,"I am trying to solve Problem II.4.7(a) of Hartshorne: The only candidate I can think of for $X_0$ would be the quotient scheme $X/\sigma$ . If it exists, it must be unique by the usual argument. First starting with the affine case, taking $A=\mathbb C[x_1,...,x_n]/I$ to be a finitely generated $\mathbb C$ -algebra, then the associated ring morphism that commutes with conjugation would leave us with the invariant algebra being $A^\sigma=\mathbb R[x_1,...,x_n]/\bar I $ where $\bar I$ is the real part of $I$ . Then here it follows that $\text{Spec}A^\sigma\times_\mathbb{R}\mathbb C=\text{Spec}A$ by just tensoring $A^\sigma\otimes_\mathbb{R}\mathbb C=A$ . For the general case, I found a helpful clue from Bosch's AG book.  Exercise 7.1.8 of Bosch says: Let $X$ be a scheme and $\Gamma$ a finite group of automorphisms. The quotient $X/\Gamma$ exists if there is a $\Gamma$ -invariant affine open cover of $X$ . Further,  if $X$ is separated, then the quotient $X/\Gamma$ exists if all the points in any $\Gamma$ -orbit are contained in an open affine. Since by assumption we have that any two points are in an open affine and our orbit has at most two points, this exercise will give us the existence of the quotient. But I want to prove it first. My idea is to first construct the scheme to be locally the invariant rings. That is, if $X=\bigcup_{i=1}^n\text{Spec}A_i$ , take $X/ \Gamma := \bigcup_{i=1}^n \text{Spec}A_i^{\Gamma}$ as a set. Since $X$ is separated, the intersection of any two affines is affine, and define $\text{Spec}A_{ij}:=\text{Spec}(A_i^\Gamma\otimes_\mathbb{C} A_j^\Gamma)=\text{Spec}A_i^{\Gamma}\cap \text{Spec}A_j^{\Gamma}$ , which I naively want to use to glue together. However, the cocycle condition is not necessarily satisfied since we don't seem to have an isomorphism here: $\text{Spec}A_{ij}\cap \text{Spec}A_{ik}=\text{Spec}(A_{ij}\otimes_\mathbb{C} A_{ik})$ , but $\text{Spec}A_{ji}\cap \text{Spec}A_{jk}=\text{Spec}(A_{ij}\otimes_\mathbb{C} A_{jk})$ , and $A_{ij}\neq A_{jk}$ , and from here I'm lost. A second idea is the following: let $U$ be an affine open, and since $\gamma\in\Gamma$ is an automorphism, then $\gamma(U)$ is affine.

Then here it follows that by just tensoring . For the general case, I found a helpful clue from Bosch's AG book.  Exercise 7.1.8 of Bosch says: Let be a scheme and a finite group of automorphisms. The quotient exists if there is a -invariant affine open cover of . Further,  if is separated, then the quotient exists if all the points in any -orbit are contained in an open affine. Since by assumption we have that any two points are in an open affine and our orbit has at most two points, this exercise will give us the existence of the quotient. But I want to prove it first. My idea is to first construct the scheme to be locally the invariant rings. That is, if , take as a set.

95,Scheme Theoretic Image (Hartshorne Ex.II.3.11.d),Scheme Theoretic Image (Hartshorne Ex.II.3.11.d),,"The exercise asks to establish that given a morphism of schemes $f: Z \rightarrow X$ , there is a unique closed subscheme $Y \rightarrow X$ , such that 1) $f$ factors through $Y$ , and 2) whenever $Y'$ is another closed subscheme of $X$ such that $f$ factors through $Y'$ , then $Y \rightarrow X$ factors through $Y'$ . Most of the treatments of this problem i came across use a sheaf-of-ideals approach. Instead, i have been thinking about two more direct approaches (direct in the sense that Hartshorne poses this problem prior to introducing sheaves of ideals). First Aproach: As a topological space, let $Y$ be the topological closure in $X$ of the image of $f$ . Let $i: Y \rightarrow X$ be the inclusion map, and assign to $Y$ the sheaf $\mathcal O_Y:=i^{-1} \operatorname{im}f^{\#}$ , where $f^{\#}: \mathcal{O}_X \rightarrow f_* \mathcal{O}_Z$ . Then the morphism of sheaves $\mathcal{O}_X \rightarrow i_* \mathcal{O}_Y$ is the one given by composing $f^{\#}$ with the canonical morphism $\operatorname{im}f^{\#} \rightarrow i_* i^{-1} \operatorname{im}f^{\#}$ , and it is surjective by construction. Denoting by $f'$ the morphism $f$ with target $Y$ , one gives a morphism $ \mathcal{O}_Y \rightarrow f'_* \mathcal{O}_Z$ , by starting with the inclusion $\operatorname{im}f^{\#} \rightarrow f_* \mathcal{O}_Z$ , and then passing to $\mathcal{O}_Y=i^{-1}\operatorname{im}f^{\#} \rightarrow i^{-1} f_* \mathcal{O}_Z = f'_* \mathcal{O}_Z$ . One similarly checks the commutation of the diagram on the level of sheaves and the universal property of $Y$ . Do you agree with this approach? Second Aproach: If $X = \operatorname{Spec} A$ is affine, then we can cover $Z$ by open affines $\operatorname{Spec} B_i$ and the morphism $f$ is given locally by ring homomorphisms $\phi_i : A \rightarrow B_i$ . Then we can take $Y$ to be $\operatorname{Spec} (A/\cap_i\operatorname{ker} \phi_i)$ . If $X$ is not affine, then it is reasonable to cover it by open affines $X = \bigcup \operatorname{Spec} A_j$ , define $Y$ locally at each $\operatorname{Spec} A_j$ as above, and then glue the $Y_j$ . However, this might be problematic because the union of all $Y_j$ might not even be a closed set of $X$ . How can this difficulty be surpassed?","The exercise asks to establish that given a morphism of schemes , there is a unique closed subscheme , such that 1) factors through , and 2) whenever is another closed subscheme of such that factors through , then factors through .
