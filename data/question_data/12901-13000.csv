0,"This (rather long) implicit equation has a short explicit solution, but how can it be found?","This (rather long) implicit equation has a short explicit solution, but how can it be found?",,"I am curious if a method exists for solving for $k$ or $h$ in this implicit equation: $$\frac{k^2}{h} \mathrm{sech}^2(k) \sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{k}{h} \tanh(k)\right)^2} = \ln\left( \frac{k}{h} \tanh(k) + \sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{k}{h} \tanh(k)\right)^2}\right)$$ Both $k=0$ and $h=\pm k\, \mathrm{sech}(k)$ are solutions. I can easily check that these work, but I have been unable to find a way to manipulate the implicit equation to get these solutions. I have tried writing the hyperbolic functions in terms of their equivalent exponential functions (like $\tanh(x)=\frac{e^{2x}-1}{e^{2x}+1}$ , etc.), raising $e$ to the power of both sides (to remove the log), and (unsuccessfully) factoring the part under the root. Even Wolfram Alpha says, ""Standard computation time exceeded...""! Again, my question is about what techniques could be used to find these explicit solutions (especially $h=k\, \mathrm{sech}(k)$ ) if I did not already know them. Background I am currently taking Calculus 2. A couple weeks ago, for fun, I decided to try to calculate the shape of a soap film between two parallel rings and the maximum distance between the rings before the bubble would pop. Since the soap tries to minimize surface area, it forms the shape of a catenoid (the surface of revolution of hyperbolic cosine). I let the radius of the rings equal $1$ , $h$ equal half the distance between the rings, and $r$ equal the radius halfway between the rings (the minimum of $cosh$ ). I found that letting $k = \mathrm{sech}^{-1}(r)$ simplified things. Using integration, I found the surface area of $y=\mathrm{sech}(k)\cosh\left(\frac{k}{h}x\right)$ revolved around the X-axis between $-h$ and $h$ . The bubble should then converge to the nearest local minimum of this area. Taking the derivative of this with respect to $k$ and setting it equal to zero gave me the above equation. After trying to solve the equation for a while, I found this site that says the maximum separation between the rings was the maximum height of $\frac{x}{\cosh(x)}$ . I tried this expression in my equation, and, to my amazement, it worked.","I am curious if a method exists for solving for or in this implicit equation: Both and are solutions.

Is there a good way to visualize why they are equivalent? Why are they presented differently? My next question is the notation in (3). This notation is said to be the Lebesgue integral in its ""standard"" form. My interpretation of this integral is that it is integrated over E, which is the domain of the function f. This seems more akin to Riemann integration where the domain is partitioned rather than the range (in this case if the measure space is (E,X,μ) and f : E->R, where R is the reals). Shouldn't it be summed over R instead? also how should dμ be interpreted? If you look at (4) it makes sense. The integral is integrated over the domain of f, E. Then, the function is evaluated at x ϵ E. μ(dx) also makes sense, as dx is some segment of E, which is an element of the sigma space X.

My high school book says its a non-integrable function while WolframAlpha says its integral is Si $(x) +$ constant. Please shed some light on this topic and explain from basic level like what is Si $(x)$ , who used it for the first time etc.","I want to know if the function is integrable and if it is, then what's its integral?
