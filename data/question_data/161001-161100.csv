A function $f: (X,\mathbb{\mathcal{A}}) \rightarrow  (\mathbb{R},\mathcal{B})$ is $\mathcal{A}$ measurable if for all real $\alpha$, $\{x:f(x)>\alpha\}\in \mathcal{A}$. In particular, if $\mathcal{L}$ is the Lebesgue $\sigma-$ algebra, $f:(\mathbb{R},\mathcal{L}) \rightarrow (\mathbb{R},\mathcal{B})$ is Lebesgue measurable if it satisfies the above definition. Claim 1: If $f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is Lebesgue measurable and $g:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is continuous, then $g \circ f$ is Lebesgue measurable. Proof: Let $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$. Since the inverse image under a continuous function of an open set is an open set, $G=\{x:g(x)>\alpha\}$ is open and therefore a Borel set. Since $\mathcal{B} \subset \mathcal{L}$, and $f$ is Lebesgue measurable, we see that $f^{-1}(G) \in \mathcal{L}$. Therefore $g \circ f$ is Lebesgue measurable. Claim 2: A slight modification of the above proof shows that the above result holds if $g$ is Borel measurable instead of continuous. Claim 3 If $f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and $g:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ are both Lebesgue measurable, then $g \circ f$ need not be Lebesgue measurable. Proof Let $C$ be the cantor set. Note that $C$ has Lebesgue measure $0$. Let $f: [0,1] \rightarrow C$ be the well known strictly increasing function that maps the interval $[0,1]$ onto $C$. Then $f$ is Borel measurable and therefore Lebesgue measurable. Let $V \subset    [0,1]$ be the vitali set. Since the Lebesgue measure is complete, we find that $f(V) \subset C$ is lebesgue measurable (with measure zero). Let $g:C \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ be the indicator function for $f(V)$, i.e, $g=\chi_{f(V)}$. Then $g$ is Lebesgue measurable by direct verification.  However, $\{x:g\circ f>0\}=V$ which is not Lebesgue measurable.

Proof: Let $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$. Since the inverse image under a continuous function of an open set is an open set, $G=\{x:g(x)>\alpha\}$ is open and therefore a Borel set. Since $\mathcal{B} \subset \mathcal{L}$, and $f$ is Lebesgue measurable, we see that $f^{-1}(G) \in \mathcal{L}$. Therefore $g \circ f$ is Lebesgue measurable. Claim 2: A slight modification of the above proof shows that the above result holds if $g$ is Borel measurable instead of continuous. Claim 3 If $f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and $g:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ are both Lebesgue measurable, then $g \circ f$ need not be Lebesgue measurable. Proof Let $C$ be the cantor set. Note that $C$ has Lebesgue measure $0$. Let $f: [0,1] \rightarrow C$ be the well known strictly increasing function that maps the interval $[0,1]$ onto $C$. Then $f$ is Borel measurable and therefore Lebesgue measurable. Let $V \subset    [0,1]$ be the vitali set. Since the Lebesgue measure is complete, we find that $f(V) \subset C$ is lebesgue measurable (with measure zero). Let $g:C \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ be the indicator function for $f(V)$, i.e, $g=\chi_{f(V)}$. Then $g$ is Lebesgue measurable by direct verification.  However, $\{x:g\circ f>0\}=V$ which is not Lebesgue measurable. Question Doesn't the counterexample in claim 3 contradict claim 2, due to $f$ and $g$ both being Borel measurable?",,['measure-theory']

My problem is that my method for showing right-continuity works also to show $F$ is left-continuous. My proof of both must therefore be wrong but I do not know where. A distribution function of a random variable $X$ can be defined as $F(x)=\mu(-\infty,x]=P[X\leq x],$ where $P$ is the probability measure of the underlying probability space $(\Omega,\mathscr{F},P)$, and $\mu$ is a probability measure on the 1-dimensional Borel sets $\mathscr{R}$. Using the monotonicity of $\mu$ we see that $F$ is non-decreasing. Also for $a\leq x$ we have $\mu(a,x]=\mu(-\infty,x]-\mu(-\infty,a]$. I think the fact that $F$ is defined as $\mu(-\infty,x]$ and not $\mu(-\infty,x)$ means that $F$ can have a jump discontinuity say at $a$ as $x$ approaches from the left but not from the right - i.e $F$ is right but not left-continuous. My proofs rely on the following result: if $A_{n}$ and $A$ lie in $\mathscr{F}$ and $A_{n}\downarrow A$, and if $\mu(A_{1})<\infty$, then $\mu(A_{n})\downarrow \mu(A)$.

Since $(x,y_{n}]$ and $\emptyset$ are in $\mathscr{F}$, and $\mu(x,y_{1}]\leq 1<\infty$, then we have $\mu(x,y_{n}]\downarrow\mu(\emptyset)=0$. Equivalently $F(y_{n})-F(x)\downarrow 0:F(y_{1})-F(x)\geq F(y_{2})-F(x)\geq...$ and $F(y_{n})-F(x)\rightarrow 0$. Thus we have $F(y_{1})\geq F(y_{2})\geq ...$, and $F(y_{n})\rightarrow F(x)$.

To do this I thought that was generated by all elements of if I could show any element of is contained in then I would be done, which I feel can be reduced to showing all elements of are contained in , though I am not sure as I do not know how to proceed from here.

57,Can the following construction be used to measure countable sets?,Can the following construction be used to measure countable sets?,,"New Edit: The Measure has several problems. My answer is stated below the post I previously stated: ""I manipulated the Construction so that if $T_1=T_2$ then $\mu(T_1)=\mu(T_2)$. If the construction can be   improved let me know. "" I was wrong. I cannot manipulate the construction to have a consistent measure for equivalent sets with different non-reduced forms. However, if the equivalent sets had different reduced forms, their measures would be the same. Moreover, to compare the size of non-equivalent sets, the sets must be simplified first. See the section ""Sets Must Be Simplified Before Being Measured"" The construction of the measure is similar to Natural Density and Counting Measure . Consider a group of countably infinite sets dense in $[a,b]$ $T_1=\left\{\left.a<\frac{M_1(n_1)}{R_1(q_1)}<b\right|n_1,q_1\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}$ $,T_2=\left\{\left.a<\frac{M_2(n_2)}{R_2(q_2)}<b\right|n_2,q_2\in\mathbb{Z}\right\},...,$ $T_m=\left\{\left.a<\frac{M_m(n_m)}{R_m(q_m)}<b\right|n_m,q_m\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}$ I want to create a measure that compares the ""size"" of each countable dense set to all the sets. User @Mikhail suggested: ""It is indeed possible to get measures that behave in a nontrivial fashion on countable subsets, and indeed the axiom of choice or some weaker forms thereof are relevant here.  Namely, one can get a finitely-additive ( not $\sigma$-additive) measure $\xi$ on the set of subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ such that $\xi(S)=0$ for any finite set $S\subseteq\mathbb{N}$ and $\xi(S)=1$ for any cofinite subset (i.e., subset with a finite complement). Here $\xi$ takes only two values, zero or one. For sets that are neither finite nor cofinite, the measure behaves in a nontrivial way but always exactly one of a pair of complementary sets has measure one. Such measures are used in ultraproduct constructions."" However, due to my lack of understanding of ultra-product constructions and axiom of choice, I created an alternate construction which may or may not follow the principles of measure theory. The construction below involves cardinality and ratios. The Construction We begin by taking the cardinality of $T_c=\left\{\left.a<\frac{M_c(n_c)}{R_c(q_c)}<b\right|n_c,q_c\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}$  (where $c$ is an integer and $1\le c \le m$) \begin{equation} \left|\left\{\left.a<\frac{M_c(n_c)}{R_c(q_c)}<b\right|n_c,q_c\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}\right| \end{equation} The countably infinite set can divided into an infinite union of finite sets. \begin{equation} \left|\lim_{t\to\infty}\bigcup_{q_c=-t}^{t}\left\{\left.a<\frac{M_c(n_c)}{R_c(q_c)}<b\right|n_c\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}\right| \end{equation} The union can be modified inorder for the ""compactness"" of $R_c(q_c)$ to be included in the measure; however, $T_c$ must be simplified first (There is a section below defending simplification). Here are the steps to fully reducing the set. One must be able to factor $h_c$ out of all coefficients of $M_c(n_c)$ and factor $p_c$ out of all coefficients of $R_c(q_c)$. $h_c/p_c$ must be fully reduced to get ${h_c}'/{p_c}'$. If the denominator is irrational then it must be rationalized. After multiplying the ${h_c}'$ to the numerator ${p_c}'$ to the denominator we end up with $M_c^{'}(n_c)$ and $R_c^{'}(q_c)$. (All coefficients must not be in the form of fractions) We end up using ${R_c}^{'}(q_c)$ to modify the previous equation. $$s_c(t)=\left|\bigcup_{v_c\in \left\{\left.-t\le {{R_c}^{'}(q_c)} \le t \right|q_c\in \mathbb{Z} \right\}}\left\{\left.a<\frac{M_c(n_c)}{v_c}<b\right|n_c\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}\right|$$ The function $s_c(t)$ is the modified cardinality of $T_c$. Similarly $s_1(t),s_2(t),..s_m(t)$ are the modified cardinalities of $T_1,T_2,..,T_m$. If the finite sets in the union of $s_c(t)$ were disjoint, $s_c(t)$ would equal $$=\sum_{v_c\in \left\{\left.-t\le {{R_c}^{'}(q_c)}\le t \right|q_c\in \mathbb{Z} \right\}}\left|\left\{\left.a<\frac{M_c(n_c)}{v_c}<b\right|n_c\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}\right|$$ However, in most cases, the finite sets are not disjoint. Hence $s_c(t)$ would be less than the sum above. This makes the modified cardinalities countably sub-additive. The ""construction"" of the measure of $T_c$ ends up being $$\mu(T_c)=\lim_{t\to\infty}\frac{s_{c}(t)}{s_1(t)+s_2(t)+...+s_m(t)}$$ $$\mu(T_c)=\lim_{t\to\infty}\frac{s_c(t)}{\sum_{p=1}^{m} s_{p}(t)}$$ Sets must be Simplified before being measured In order to show one set is a subset of another set, both sets must be simplified. Consider sets $T_1=\left\{\left.\frac{2n+1}{4p+2}\right|n,p\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}$ and $T_2=\left\{\left. \frac{8r+6}{16v+12}\right|r,v\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}$. We can prove $T_2\subset{T_1}$, if the numerator of $T_2$ is a subset of the numerator of $T_1$ and the denominator of $T_2$ is a subset of the denominator of $T_1$. However $\left\{\left.8r+6\right|r\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}\not\subset\left\{\left.2n+1\right|n\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}$ and $\left\{\left.16v+12\right|v\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}\not\subset\left\{\left.4p+2\right|p\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}$. We have to simplify both sets! Set $T_1$ is fully reduced but $T_2$ can be simplified into $\left\{\left.\frac{4r+3}{8v+6}\right|r,v \in \mathbb{Z}\right\}$. We find that $\left\{\left.4r+3\right|r\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}\subset\left\{\left.2n+1\right|n\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}$ and $\left\{\left.8n+6\right|v\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}\subset\left\{\left.4p+2\right|p\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}$. Hence $T_2\subset T_1$ but both sets must be simplified before being compared to one another. If we set $T_1=T_2$, with the sets in different unreduced forms, the sets must be simplified into reduced forms. Otherwise the sets cannot be properly compared to one another. Infact, if the equivalent reduced sets were measured, both set would have equal measure. I will give an example but not go in detail with the calculations. If we set $T_1=\left\{\left.\frac{2p+1}{2q+1}\right|p,q\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}$ and $T_2=\left\{\left.\frac{2p+3}{2q+5}\right|p,q\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}$ and compare the size of the sets between [1,2]; both sets are already reduced and should have a measure of $1/2$. This is easy to prove, since the cardinalities of the sets divided into finite unions are the same and so are the elements of the sets' denominators when restricted by $[-t,t]$. Example for Applying the Measure (If $T_2\subset T_1$ then $\mu(T_2)<\mu(T_1)$) Say we set $T_1=\left\{\left.\frac{\sqrt{n}}{q^2}\right|n,q\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}$ and $T_2=\left\{\left.\frac{\sqrt{2m+1}}{r^4}\right|m,r\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}$ and compare the size of the set between $[1,2]$ (Note that $T_2\subset{T_1}$.) Since $T_1$ is fully simplified, we can apply the measure. $$s_1(t)=\left|\bigcup_{v_1\in\left\{\left.-t<q^2<t\right|q\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}}\left\{\left.1<\frac{\sqrt{n}}{v_1}<2\right|n\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}\right|$$ $$=\sum_{q=1}^{\left\lfloor\sqrt t\right\rfloor}\left\lfloor(2q^2)^2 \right\rfloor-\left\lceil(q^2)^2 \right\rceil+1$$ (Note we do not sum elements that are undefined or repeated in other finite sets.) Since $T_2$ is simplified, we can apply the measure. $$s_2(t)=\left|\bigcup_{v_2\in\left\{\left.-t<{r^4}<t\right|q\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}}\left\{\left.1<\frac{\sqrt{2m+1}}{v_2}<2\right|m\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}\right|$$ $$=\sum_{r=1}^{\lfloor\sqrt[4]{t}\rfloor}\left\lfloor\frac{(2r^4)^2-1}{2}\right\rfloor-\left\lceil\frac{(2r^4)^2-1}{2}\right\rceil+1$$ The measure of each set ends up being $$\mu(T_1)=\lim_{t\to\infty}\frac{s_1(t)}{s_1(t)+s_2(t)}=1$$ $$\mu(T_2)=\lim_{t\to\infty}\frac{s_2(t)}{s_1(t)+s_2(t)}=0$$ Hence $T_1$ has a measure of 1 and $T_2$ has a measure of 0. Properties of the Construction If $T_1 \subset T_2$ then $\mu(T_1)<\mu(T_2)$ If $T_1$ and $T_2$ are fully reduced and $T_1=T_2$ then $\mu(T_1)=\mu(T_2)$. (Note that $T_1$ and $T_2$ can be in different reduced forms and still be equal) (If $>>$ means ""growth rate is infinitely greater than as $x\to\pm\infty$"", $<<$ means ""growth rate is infinitely smaller than as $x\to\pm\infty$"", $\sim$ means ""growth rate is porportional as $x\to\pm\infty$"", and any listed function eventually increases without any bound, the following is also true.) If ${|M_1(x)|}>>{|M_{2}(x)|}$ and $|R_1(x)|\sim|R_2(x)|$ ; $|M_{1}(x)|\sim |M_{2}(x)|$ and $|R_{1}(x)|>>|R_{2}(x)|$ ; or $|M_{1}(x)|>>|M_{2}(x)|$ and $|R_{1}(x)>>R_{2}(x)|$, then $\mu(T_1)=0$ and $\mu(T_2)=1$. If ${|M_1(x)|}<<{|M_{2}(x)|}$ and $|R_1(x)|\sim|R_2(x)|$ ; $|M_{1}(x)|\sim |M_{2}(x)|$ and $|R_{1}(x)|<<|R_{2}(x)|$ ; or $|M_{1}(x)|<<|M_{2}(x)|$ and $|R_{1}(x)<<R_{2}(x)|$, then $\mu(T_1)=1$ and $\mu(T_2)=0$. If $|M_{1}(x)|>>|M_{2}(x)|$ , $|R_{1}(x)|<<|R_{2}(x)|$ , and $|R_{1}(x)|>>|M_{2}(x)|$ , then $\mu({T_1})=0$ and $\mu({T_2})=1$. If $|M_{1}(x)|>>|M_{2}(x)|$ , $|R_{1}(x)|<<|R_{2}(x)|$ , and $|R_{1}(x)|<<|M_{2}(x)|$ , then $\mu({T_1})=1$ and $\mu({T_2})=0$ However, as suggested in a previous question, there is no ""best way"" of measuring the size of countable sets. Can the following construction be used to measure countable sets? If not, how can we alter the construction, to make a measure possible? What other measures can be used?","New Edit: The Measure has several problems. My answer is stated below the post I previously stated: ""I manipulated the Construction so that if $T_1=T_2$ then $\mu(T_1)=\mu(T_2)$. If the construction can be   improved let me know. "" I was wrong. I cannot manipulate the construction to have a consistent measure for equivalent sets with different non-reduced forms. However, if the equivalent sets had different reduced forms, their measures would be the same. Moreover, to compare the size of non-equivalent sets, the sets must be simplified first. See the section ""Sets Must Be Simplified Before Being Measured"" The construction of the measure is similar to Natural Density and Counting Measure . Consider a group of countably infinite sets dense in $[a,b]$ $T_1=\left\{\left.a<\frac{M_1(n_1)}{R_1(q_1)}<b\right|n_1,q_1\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}$ $,T_2=\left\{\left.a<\frac{M_2(n_2)}{R_2(q_2)}<b\right|n_2,q_2\in\mathbb{Z}\right\},...,$ $T_m=\left\{\left.a<\frac{M_m(n_m)}{R_m(q_m)}<b\right|n_m,q_m\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}$ I want to create a measure that compares the ""size"" of each countable dense set to all the sets. User @Mikhail suggested: ""It is indeed possible to get measures that behave in a nontrivial fashion on countable subsets, and indeed the axiom of choice or some weaker forms thereof are relevant here.  Namely, one can get a finitely-additive ( not $\sigma$-additive) measure $\xi$ on the set of subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ such that $\xi(S)=0$ for any finite set $S\subseteq\mathbb{N}$ and $\xi(S)=1$ for any cofinite subset (i.e., subset with a finite complement). Here $\xi$ takes only two values, zero or one. For sets that are neither finite nor cofinite, the measure behaves in a nontrivial way but always exactly one of a pair of complementary sets has measure one. Such measures are used in ultraproduct constructions."" However, due to my lack of understanding of ultra-product constructions and axiom of choice, I created an alternate construction which may or may not follow the principles of measure theory. The construction below involves cardinality and ratios. The Construction We begin by taking the cardinality of $T_c=\left\{\left.a<\frac{M_c(n_c)}{R_c(q_c)}<b\right|n_c,q_c\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}$  (where $c$ is an integer and $1\le c \le m$) \begin{equation} \left|\left\{\left.a<\frac{M_c(n_c)}{R_c(q_c)}<b\right|n_c,q_c\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}\right| \end{equation} The countably infinite set can divided into an infinite union of finite sets. \begin{equation} \left|\lim_{t\to\infty}\bigcup_{q_c=-t}^{t}\left\{\left.a<\frac{M_c(n_c)}{R_c(q_c)}<b\right|n_c\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}\right| \end{equation} The union can be modified inorder for the ""compactness"" of $R_c(q_c)$ to be included in the measure; however, $T_c$ must be simplified first (There is a section below defending simplification). Here are the steps to fully reducing the set. One must be able to factor $h_c$ out of all coefficients of $M_c(n_c)$ and factor $p_c$ out of all coefficients of $R_c(q_c)$. $h_c/p_c$ must be fully reduced to get ${h_c}'/{p_c}'$. If the denominator is irrational then it must be rationalized. After multiplying the ${h_c}'$ to the numerator ${p_c}'$ to the denominator we end up with $M_c^{'}(n_c)$ and $R_c^{'}(q_c)$. (All coefficients must not be in the form of fractions) We end up using ${R_c}^{'}(q_c)$ to modify the previous equation. $$s_c(t)=\left|\bigcup_{v_c\in \left\{\left.-t\le {{R_c}^{'}(q_c)} \le t \right|q_c\in \mathbb{Z} \right\}}\left\{\left.a<\frac{M_c(n_c)}{v_c}<b\right|n_c\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}\right|$$ The function $s_c(t)$ is the modified cardinality of $T_c$. Similarly $s_1(t),s_2(t),..s_m(t)$ are the modified cardinalities of $T_1,T_2,..,T_m$. If the finite sets in the union of $s_c(t)$ were disjoint, $s_c(t)$ would equal $$=\sum_{v_c\in \left\{\left.-t\le {{R_c}^{'}(q_c)}\le t \right|q_c\in \mathbb{Z} \right\}}\left|\left\{\left.a<\frac{M_c(n_c)}{v_c}<b\right|n_c\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}\right|$$ However, in most cases, the finite sets are not disjoint. Hence $s_c(t)$ would be less than the sum above. This makes the modified cardinalities countably sub-additive. The ""construction"" of the measure of $T_c$ ends up being $$\mu(T_c)=\lim_{t\to\infty}\frac{s_{c}(t)}{s_1(t)+s_2(t)+...+s_m(t)}$$ $$\mu(T_c)=\lim_{t\to\infty}\frac{s_c(t)}{\sum_{p=1}^{m} s_{p}(t)}$$ Sets must be Simplified before being measured In order to show one set is a subset of another set, both sets must be simplified. Consider sets $T_1=\left\{\left.\frac{2n+1}{4p+2}\right|n,p\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}$ and $T_2=\left\{\left. \frac{8r+6}{16v+12}\right|r,v\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}$. We can prove $T_2\subset{T_1}$, if the numerator of $T_2$ is a subset of the numerator of $T_1$ and the denominator of $T_2$ is a subset of the denominator of $T_1$. However $\left\{\left.8r+6\right|r\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}\not\subset\left\{\left.2n+1\right|n\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}$ and $\left\{\left.16v+12\right|v\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}\not\subset\left\{\left.4p+2\right|p\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}$.

Show that $\cup\{K:K\in \mathcal{K}\}$ is a Lebesgue set (Measurable with respect to the Lebesgue measure). If the union is countable the argument is quite simple: each $K\in \mathcal{K}$ is closed and thus a Borel set (i.e. belongs to the Borel $\sigma$-algebra), and since $\sigma$-algebras are closed under countable unions, $S=\cup\{K:K\in \mathcal{K}\}$ is a Borel set. Since every Borel set is Lebesgue measurable, we are done. Thus, WLOG we can assume that $\mathcal{K}$ is an uncountable family. The hint given is to use the Vitali Covering theorem. I am not quite sure how to work this out yet but have a few ideas. My main idea is to use the fact that every Lebesgue measurable set can be written as the union of a Borel set and a set of Lebesgue measure zero, and every set that can be written in such a form is Lebesgue measurable. We can take $V=\{C\subset \mathbb{R}^n: C $ is a compact cube s.t. $C\subset K$ some $K\in \mathcal{K}\}$.

Show that $\cup\{K:K\in \mathcal{K}\}$ is a Lebesgue set (Measurable with respect to the Lebesgue measure). If the union is countable the argument is quite simple: each $K\in \mathcal{K}$ is closed and thus a Borel set (i.e. belongs to the Borel $\sigma$-algebra), and since $\sigma$-algebras are closed under countable unions, $S=\cup\{K:K\in \mathcal{K}\}$ is a Borel set. Since every Borel set is Lebesgue measurable, we are done. Thus, WLOG we can assume that $\mathcal{K}$ is an uncountable family. The hint given is to use the Vitali Covering theorem.
