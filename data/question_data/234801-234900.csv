1,Prove The class Recset of recursive sets is the same as the class of all sets.,Prove The class Recset of recursive sets is the same as the class of all sets.,,"This is from spring18 mcs.pdf . recursive set definition Definition 8.3.1. The class of recursive sets Recset is defined as follows: Base case: The empty set $\varnothing$ is a Recset. Constructor step: If S is a nonempty set of Recset’s, then S is a Recset. What to prove Theorem 8.3.2. The class Recset of recursive sets is the same as the class of all sets. Proof. Everything in Recset is a set by definition, so we need only show that every set is in Recset. Suppose to the contrary that a set S is not in Recset. So S must have an ele- ment $N_0$ that is not in Recset, since otherwise S would by definition be in Recset. Likewise, $N_0$ must have an element $N_1$ that is not in Recset, and $N_1$ must have an element $N_2$ that is not in Recset, and so on. So we have an infinite sequence $$ S \ni N_0 \ni N_1 \ni N_2 \ni \ldots $$ Therefore the set $^8$ $$ T ::= \{S, N_0 , N_1 , N_2 , \ldots\} $$ has no member-minimal element, in violation of Foundation. $^8$ A rigorous proof, which we are skipping, requires careful use of the Choice axiom to prove that T is a set. I prove $T$ is one set as follows: Here let the family of sets be $U,S,N_{0,\cdots}$ where $U$ is the universal set. Then let the choice function be $U\to S,S\to N_0,\cdots$ . Then $T$ is the indexed set . I have questions about the ""infinite sequence"" part of the proof. Suppose one set $S=\{1\}$ is not in Recset.

Is my proof correct?,A\sim B \mathscr{P}(A)\sim \mathscr{P}(B),"I think I understand the way it should be proved, I think I get the idea, but I'm unsure about writing it. That is my proof. Since $A \sim B$ there is a function $f:A\to B$ that is one-to-one and onto. We can use this function to make the function $g:\mathscr{P}(A)\to\mathscr{P}(B)$ . For any $X\subseteq A$ we can take $g(X) = f(X)$ i.e. we use image of $X$ under the function $f$ as our function $g$ from $\mathscr{P}(A)$ to $\mathscr{P}(B)$ . (I'm not sure about that. May be I could use the symbol $f$ without introducing $g$ but I wanted to avoid using $f$ both for the function from $A$ to $B$ and for the function from $\mathscr{P}(A)$ to $\mathscr{P}(B)$ ) Now we should check that $g$ is one-to-one and onto. Let's assume $X_1\in \mathscr{P}(A)$ and $X_2\in \mathscr{P}(A)$ , $X_1\neq X_2$ but $g(X_1) = g(X_2) = Y \in \mathscr{P}(B)$ . Since $X_1 \neq X_2$ let's choose $x\in X_1$ but $x\notin X_2$ . If $X_1 \subseteq X_2$ we should switch the subscripts before choosing $x$ . Let $y = f(x)$ and $y\in Y$ since $g(X_1) = Y$ . But then there is some $x' \in X_2$ so that $f(x') = y$ . But $f$ is one-to-one so $x = x'$ and $x\in X_2$ . Contradiction. Using this steps to be more rigorous it's easy to proove that $X_1 \subseteq X_2$ and $X_2 \subseteq X_1$ . So $g$ is one-to-one. Let's choose any set $Y \in \mathscr{P}(B)$ . Since $f$ is onto then for any nonempty set $Y$ there is nonempty set $X\in \mathscr{P}(A)$ so that $g(X) = Y$ .

19,A confusing proof-outline for the Schröder-Bernstein Theorem.,A confusing proof-outline for the Schröder-Bernstein Theorem.,,"I have seen a number of  proofs of the much popular Schroder–Bernstein Theorem. But a particular proof outline interested me. My version of the Schroder–Bernstein Theorem is : Assume there exists a $1–1$ function $f : X → Y$ and another $1–1$ function $g : Y → X.$ Then there exists a $1–1,$ onto function $h : X → Y $ The proof outline was stated as follows: (a) The range of $f$ is defined by $f(X) = \{y\in Y:y=f(x) \text{ for some} x ∈ X\}.$ Let $y ∈ f(X).$ (Because $f$ is not necessarily onto, the range $f(X)$ may not be all of $Y .$ ) Explain why there exists a unique $x ∈ X$ such that $f(x) = y.$ Now define $f ^{−1}(y) = x,$ and show that $f^{ −1}$ is a $1–1$ function from $f(X)$ onto $X.$ In a similar way, we can also define the $1–1$ function $g^{−1} : g(Y) → Y .$ (b) Let $x ∈ X$ be arbitrary. Let the chain $C_x$ be the set consisting of all elements of the form $$(1) \space\space\space\space\space\space\space... ,f ^{−1}(g^{−1}(x)), g^{−1}(x), x, f(x), g(f(x)), f(g(f(x))),... .$$ Explain why the number of elements to the left of $x$ in the above chain may be zero, finite, or infinite. (c) Show that any two chains are either identical or completely disjoint.

I could solve the claims in $a,b$ and $c.$ Problem 1(Solved): Regarding this problem, currently I have no issues with this anyomore. Please check the other problem i.e, $\color{green}{\text{Problem 2 (Unsolved)}}$ . But the problem lies with part $d.$ What I infered was, that : If $\exists C\in  B$ then, $\exists y\in Y$ and $y\in C$ such that $y\notin f(X)$ . But we note that $g^{-1}(g(Y))=Y$ so, $y\in g^{-1}(g(Y))-f(X).$ I found the proof given for part $d.$ in the manual as : (d) Let $C$ by a chain in $B.$ Then $C\cap Y$ is not a subset of $f(X),$ so there exists $y\in Y$ with $y\in C$ but $y\notin f(X).$ Note that $C$ and $C_y$ have a point in common, so they must be equal. But I feel that something has gone awry with the logic of the proof in the manual. This is only because, up until now, we defined chains only for the elements in $X$ and as $y\in Y(\implies y\notin X$ ) so, I don't understand what is meant by $C_y.$ Further, if I am assume, that $C_y$ is the sequence $y, g(y), f(g(y)), g(f(g(y))),... ,$ where $y$ is an element of $Y$ , there is still some problem. In part $b$ of the proof, we have proved either $C_x$ or $C_{x'}$ are completely disjoint or equal. I think, WLOG, we  can say that this assertion holds good for $C_y$ and $C_{y'}$ (where, $y,y'\in Y$ ) as well. But in this case (i.e in $d$ ) it seems that the author asserts the same thing to hold true for $C_x$ and $C_y$ (,where $x\in X,y\in Y$ ) which is, $C_x$ and $C_{y}$ are either completely disjoint (or $C_x\cap C_{y}=\phi$ ) or equal. But how can we say this, just like that, without a rigorous proof ? Problem 2(Unsolved): The proof for for claim in part $d.$ of the proof outline, is given as: Note that $Y_1\in f(X).$ To show $f : X_1\to Y_1$ is onto we pick a $y_1\in Y_1$ and show there exists $x_1 \in X_1$ with $f(x_1) = y_1.$ Well, if $y_1\in Y_1,$ we know there exists $x_1\in X$ such that $f(x_1) = y_1.$ But we must be sure that $x_1\in X_1.$ However, $C_{x_1}$ contains $y_1$ which is an element of some chain in $A.$ Since chains that intersect must be identical,  so, $C_{x_1}\subset A$ , and $x_1\in X_1.$ Now we have to show $g : Y_2\to X_2$ is onto. To do this, we pick $x_2\in X_2$ and show that there exists $y_2\in Y_2$ with $g(y_2) = x_2.$ Since $x_2\in X_2\subset  g(Y )$ we know there exists $y_2\in Y$ such that $g(y_2) = x_2.$ Now we need to show that $y_2\in B$ because if $y_2 \in Y$ and $y_2\in B$ then $y_2\in B \cup Y = Y_2.$ We know that $C_{x_2}$ contains $y_2$ which is an element of some chain $B.$ Since chains that intersect are identical $C_{x_2} \subset B, y_2 \in B,$ and hence $y_2 \in Y_2.$ Finally, to prove $X$ and $Y$ has a bijection between them, define $h : X\to Y$ by $$h(x) =f(x) \text{ if } x\in X_1$$ $$h(x)=g^{-1}(x) \text{ if } x\in X_2$$ Because $X = X_1\cup X_2$ and $f$ and $g^{-1}$ are $1–1$ and have disjoint ranges on these respective spaces, we get that $h$ is $1–1.$ Because $Y = Y_1\cup Y_2$ and $f$ and $g^{-1}$ are respectively onto, it follows that $h$ is onto as well. So, $h$ is a bijection. But the thing that confuses me, is that: (i) In the portion, where it proves, that $f:X_1\to Y_1$ , how are they so sure, of the fact that $\forall x\in X_1$ , $f(x)\in Y_1.$ I know that $Y_1\subset f(X)$ but it is never proved that $Y_1=f(X)$ till then ? It might happen for a particular $x\in X_1$ that, $f(x)\in f(X)-Y_1.$ (ii) In the portion where it proves, that $g:Y_2\to X_2,$ I have the same concern as in (i) above i.e how are they so sure, of the fact that $\forall y\in Y_2$ , $g(y)\in X_2.$ I know that $X_2\subset g(Y_2)$ but it is never proved that $X_2=g(Y_2)$ till then ?

35,ZFC and the Axiom of Choice.,ZFC and the Axiom of Choice.,,"I've been given the following problems in set theory, specifically, ZFC: Every infinite set has a countable infinite subset. Conclude that every Dedekind finite is also finite. Every infinite set is the union of two infinite disjoint sets. Every infinite set is the countable union of infinite sets. If there exists a surjection from the set $A$ to the set $B$ . Then, there exists an injection from $B$ to $A$ . If $A$ is infinite, $B \subseteq A$ and $|B| < |A|$ . Then, $\left|A \setminus B\right| = |A|$ . My thoughts and questions; This proof was taken from https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Infinite_Set_has_Countably_Infinite_Subset#:~:text=Now%2C%20suppose%20that%20that%20there,countably%20infinite%20subset%20of%20S , the third proof, and left me with some questions. Let $S$ be a infinite set. By the axiom of choice, there exists a choice function $f: \mathcal{P}(S)\setminus\{\emptyset\}\to S$ such that $$\forall s \in \mathcal{P}(S)\setminus\{\emptyset\}:f(s)\in s$$ Let $C = \left\{X \subset S\;\vert\; X \mbox{ is finite } \right\}$ , which is a set by the theorem of separation. If $A\in C$ , it follows by assumption that $S\setminus A \neq \emptyset$ , then, $S\setminus A \in \mbox{Dom}(f)$ . Define $g:C \to C$ by $$g(A) = A\cup f(S \setminus A)$$ Define $h:\omega \to C$ (here in the proof, it is said that $h$ is a recursion on $g$ , is this necessary? Can't we just define $C$ and then $h$ ?) by $$h(x)= \left\{ \begin{array}{rcl} \emptyset & \mbox{if} & x=0 \\  h(x)\cup f\left(S \setminus h(n)\right) & \mbox{if} & x = n^{+} \end{array}\right.$$ Consider now the function $j: \omega \to S$ given by $$\forall n \in \omega: j(n)=f\left(S \setminus h(n) \right)$$ which has the properties (1) $\forall n \in \omega: j(n)\notin h(n)$ (2) $\forall n \in \omega : j(n) \in h(n^{+})$ (3) $(\forall n,m \in \omega)(n\leq m) \Rightarrow h(n) \subseteq h(m)$ (4) $(\forall n,m \in \omega)(n <m) \Rightarrow j(n) \neq j(m)$ . Since $j(n) \in h(m)$ but $j(m) \notin h(m)$ . From (4), it follows that $j$ is an injection, if $\mbox{Img}(j) = B \subset S$ , then, $j: \omega \to B$ is a bijection. Thus, the set $\mbox{Img}(j) \subset S$ is countably infinite. In ZFC, every infinite set is also Dedekind infinite. Thus, if a set $X$ is Dedekind finite, $X$ is itself finite. Let $S$ be infinite. Take $a_0 \in S$ and let $A_0 = \{a_0\}$ and take $b_0 \in S\setminus A_0$ , then $B_0 = \{b_0\}$ . Take $a_1 \in S\setminus A_0 \cup B_0$ , then $A_1 = A_0\cup\{a_1\}$ , take $b_1 \in S \setminus A_1 \cup B_0$ , then $B_1 = B_0 \cup\{b_0\}$ . With this, we can construct \begin{align*} A &= \bigcup_i A_i  \\ B &= \bigcup_j B_j \end{align*} This process can't be carried indefinitely, and thus we need the axiom of choice. However, I can't think of how to precisely build this, any help would be appreciated. I'm having quite some trouble in solving problems which require the use of the axiom of choice, any tip on how to develop a better problem-solving technique for those specific cases? I'm not sure, but I believe this would follow similarly from the previous problem. If not, where does the idea breaks down and how to solve it? Taken from If there is a surjection $A\to B $ and another $B\to A$ then $A $ and $B$ are in bijection . Let $A$ and $B$ be sets and let $f: A \to B$ be a surjection.

Then $A$ is a subset of a countable set but there can't be a bijection between it and all the von Neumann integers because that would violate Tarski's Theorem. (or so I think).

(9 answers) Finite union of countable sets is countable. (2 answers) Closed 2 years ago . I made the following proof for an excercise regarding the union of two countable infinite sets, namely, that their union is countable. It would be of great help if anyone could give me some feedback regarding the argument (ranging from the quality of the argument to some improvements). Btw, thanks for your attention. The proof is as follows: Since $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ are countable, it follows that there are biijective functions $f:\mathbb{N} \to A_{1}$ and $g:\mathbb{N} \to A_{2}$ . Let $B_{2} = A_{2}\backslash A_{1}$ and so $A_{1}\cap B_{2} = \emptyset$ . Also, consider the following sets $S_{1} = \{n\in \mathbb{N}: f(n)\in A_{1}\}$ and $S_{2} = \{n\in \mathbb{N}: g(n) \in B_{2}\}$ since $B_{2} \subseteq A_{2}$ . If $B_{2} = \emptyset$ , then $A_{1}\cup A_{2} = A_{1}$ and so $f:\mathbb{N} \to A_{1}\cup A_{2}$ is a biijective function and $A_{1}\cup A_{2}$ is countable. Hence, we may assume that $B_{2}\neq \emptyset$ . By the Well Ordering Principle , $s_{2} = \min (S_{2})$ exists. Note that $S_{1} = \mathbb{N}$ and $1\leq s_{2}$ . Therefore, there are two possible cases. If $B_{2}$ is finite with $k$ elements, then define the function $h:\mathbb{N} \to A_{1}\cup B_{2}$ by $\begin{align*} 						h(n) \begin{cases} 							g(s_{1}+(n-1)), \text{ if }n\leq k\\ 							f(n-k), \text{ if }n>k. 						\end{cases} 					\end{align*}$ Therefore, $A_{1}\cup B_{2} = A_{1}\cup A_{2}$ is countable. If $B_{2}$ is infinite, then define some function $h:\mathbb{N} \to A_{1}\cup B_{2}$ by $\begin{equation*} 						h(n) = \begin{cases} 							f(n/2), \text{ if }n \text{ is even}.\\ 							g(s_{1} + (n-1)/2), \text{ if }n \text{ is odd}. 						\end{cases} 					\end{equation*}$ Thus, $A_{1}\cup B_{2} = A_{1}\cup A_{2}$ is countable.","This question already has answers here : Show that the countable union of countable sets is countable - conceptualisation help (1 answer) Prove that the union of countably many countable sets is countable.

Here is my attempt at a formal proof of it: Attempt : Let $$ X = \{ A \subseteq \N ~|~ |\N\setminus A| = |\N|\}\\ Y = \{ A \subseteq \N ~|~ |\N\setminus A| < |\N|\} $$ Since $|\N\setminus A| \le |\N|$ , $X$ and $Y$ partition $\N$ . Moreover, $$ f[X] \subseteq [0, 1)\\ f[Y] \subseteq (1, 2] $$ Hence, it suffices to show that the two restrictions $ f \restriction_X $ and $ f \restriction_Y $ are both injective.

The contrapositive is $m \notin A \to m \le n$ , i.e., $$ \exists n \in \N: \forall m \in \N \setminus A: m \le n $$ meaning $\N \setminus A$ is bounded, by which there cannot be a bijection between $\N \setminus A$ and $\N$ . ( $\leftarrow$ ) Let $B = \N\setminus A$ for brevity. Let $(C_n)_{n \in \N}$ be defined by $C_n = \{m \in B ~|~ m > n\} \subseteq \N$ . By the condition, $C_n$ is nonempty for all $n \in \N$ . So we can define a function $g: \N \to B$ such that $$ \forall n \in \N: g(n) = \min C_n $$ Since $g(n) > n$ , $g$ is injective. Furthurmore, $B \subseteq \N$ implies $|B| \le |\N|$ .

A closure operator on is a family of maps M M satisfying some suitable conditions (it is a ""pre-closure"" operator, in general idempotence it is not satisfied). Well, my question is: it is possible to use categorical closure operators to describe the category of union-closed families? Similarly, if I consider the functor-structured category (with ) and the category of preorders, it is possible to do the same thing as above?","S(\mathcal{P}) (X,\mathcal{F}) \mathcal{F} X S(\mathcal{P}) (X,\mathcal{P}(X) X (X,\mathcal{F}) \in Obj(S(\mathcal{P})) X \mathcal{F} \mathcal{P}(X) (\mathcal{C},\mathcal{X}) \mathcal{X} (E,M) E \subseteq Epi(\mathcal{C}) M \subseteq Mono(\mathcal{C}) \mathcal{X} C U(C) U: \mathcal{C} \longrightarrow \mathcal{X} X \in Obj(\mathcal{X}) M X M X \mathcal{C} c=(c_C:  -SubC \longrightarrow  -SubC)_{C \in \mathcal{C}} S(Q_2) Q_2(\Omega):=\Omega \times \Omega","['general-topology', 'elementary-set-theory', 'category-theory']"

81,Is almost-naive set theory in fuzzy logic with comprehension limited to continuous connectives consistent?,Is almost-naive set theory in fuzzy logic with comprehension limited to continuous connectives consistent?,,"I've heard the result before that naive set theory is consistent in infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic. This answer contains a citation. In this logic, every connective is continuous (w.r.t the product topology when necessary). Additionally, $[0, 1]$ equipped with the standard topology has the property that any continuous unary function has a fixed point. I'm curious whether this last property is enough to make naive set-theory consistent. I'm also curious whether almost-naive set theories that restrict comprehension to formulas with continuous connectives only are consistent. What follows is an explanation and my attempt to understand the material. I'm interested in the following first-order fuzzy logic. Let $r : \mathbb{R} \to [0, 1]$ be defined in the following way: $$ r(x) = 1 \;\;\text{iff}\;\; x \ge 1 \\ r(x) = 0 \;\; \text{iff}\;\; x \le 0 \\ r(x) = x \;\; \text{otherwise} $$ Let $[a]$ be the truth value associated with the well-formed formula $a$ in the given context. The set of all truth values is $[0, 1]$ and $1$ is the designated truth value. I'm taking the following connectives from infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic , $\to, \lnot, \leftrightarrow$ . $$ [a\to b] = r(1-[a]+[b]) \\    [a \leftrightarrow b] = 1-\mathrm{abs}([a]-[b]) \\    [\lnot a] = 1-[a] $$ Additionally, I add the following connective called strong negation, written $!a$ . Strong negation exchanges designated and undesignated truth values. $$ [!a] = 0 \;\;\text{iff}\;\; [a] = 1 \\ [!a] = 0 \;\; \text{otherwise} $$ Next, I will extend this logic to a first-order setting by adding a notion of relations and a notion of constants. Let $M$ be a metric space $(M_0, d)$ with the additional constraint that the maximum distance between any two elements is $1$ . Let $M$ additionally be equipped with an interpretation of each constant symbol, and let $M$ be equipped with a function of type $M^n \to [0, 1]$ for each relation symbol. Let $a_1, \cdots, a_n$ be terms, the truth value of $R(a_1, \cdots, a_n)$ is the truth value returned by the interpretation of $R$ in $M$ when applied to the tuple $(a_1, \cdots, a_n)$ . The truth value of $a_1 = a_2$ is $1-d(a_1, a_2)$ where $d$ is the distance  function. Additionally, the truth value of $\forall x \mathop. \varphi(x)$ is the greatest lower bound of $\varphi(w)$ for all $w$ in M. The truth value of $\exists x \mathop. \varphi(x)$ is the least upper bound of $\varphi(w)$ for all $w$ in $M$ . I will define equality $=$ as an ordinary predicate that is constrained to be a congruence with respect to all other predicates, i.e. $$ \forall \vec{x} \vec{y} \mathop. (\vec{x} = \vec{y} \to (R(\vec{x}) \leftrightarrow R(\vec{y}))) $$ The above statement includes an abuse of notation ; it cannot be expressed in our logic without a $\land$ -like connective representing the minimum of two truth values. $\vec{x} = \vec{y}$ is defined as $1 - [\text{the maximum distance in any component between $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{y}$}]$ . The connectives $\to$ and $\leftrightarrow$ are the Łukasiewicz connectives. So, here is our axiomatization of almost-naive set theory. We have the axiom of extensionality. Extensionality is sort of bizarre because of the presence of intermediate truth values, it constrains the value of $=$ even when the sets in question are not equal (more specifically, $[a=b]$ must be greater than or equal to $[\forall x \mathop. x \in a \leftrightarrow x \in b]$ .) $$ \forall a \mathop. \forall b \mathop. ((\forall x \mathop. x \in a \leftrightarrow x \in b) \to a = b) $$ We have the axiom schema of continuous comprehension. Let $\varphi$ be constrained not to include any mention of the connective $!$ . The double strong negation $!!$ is there to stop a sequence that approximates $\{x : \varphi(x)\}$ more and more closely from satisfying the axiom. $$ \exists x \mathop. !!(\forall u \mathop. u \in x \leftrightarrow \varphi(x)) $$ In this setting, the Russell set $\{x : \lnot (x \in x)\}$ simply assigns a truth value of $\frac{1}{2}$ to the statement expressing self-membership. $\{x : !(x \in x)\}$ produces a genuine contradiction, but comprehension does not promise us this particular set. This got me thinking, continuous functions from $[0,1]$ to $[0,1]$ must always have a fixed point, and the presence of these fixed points seems to defuse a broad range of possible paradoxes.

85,Toy Definition of a Topological Space,Toy Definition of a Topological Space,,"Preamble: This is a question meant to be fun and amusing -- not part of any class/homework/test/etc.  Also, please forgive my horrific typesetting.  This is my first question on this website.  I'm fluent in Latex, which seems to be close, but not exactly the language structure of this question format. Motivation: I was rereading about Point-Set Topology, and was considering to myself the possibility creating an alternative definition to a Topological Space.  To Recall, Definition : A Topology on a set $X$ is a collection $\tau$ of subsets of $X$ having the following properties: $\emptyset$ and $X$ are in $\tau$ . The union of the elements of any subcollection of $\tau$ is in $\tau$ . The intersection of the elements of any finite subcollection of $\tau$ is in $\tau$ . A set $X$ for which a topology $\tau$ has been specified is called a topological space.    That is, the ordered pair $(\tau,X)$ . -- Topology, Second Edition. James R. Munkres. Page 76. We see here that $\tau$ is a collection of subsets, as that is what our definition states.  However, suppose instead we imagine replacing $\tau$ with the function $\rho$ which accepts two inputs and provides a boolean output.  To define explicitly: $\rho: \{\text{ruleset}\} \times \mathscr{P}(X) \rightarrow \{1,0\}$ $\rho(\{\text{ruleset}\},U) = 1$ , if $U$ is open or a complement of an open set according to the ruleset. *notice here that both $X$ and $\emptyset$ would return a value of $1$ , as they are both open, and complements of each other. $\rho(\{\text{ruleset}\},U) = 0$ , else. (We define $\mathscr{P}(X)$ to be the powerset of the set $X$ ). Now if the ruleset is something simple such as ""If $U$ is in $\mathscr{P}(X)$ "" then we trivially get back the definition via $\tau$ . If the ruleset includes a proviso for an open subset $A \subseteq X$ so that the intersection of $A$ and $U$ is open provided $U$ is open in $X$ , then we get the subspace topology.

This is my first question on this website.  I'm fluent in Latex, which seems to be close, but not exactly the language structure of this question format. Motivation: I was rereading about Point-Set Topology, and was considering to myself the possibility creating an alternative definition to a Topological Space.  To Recall, Definition : A Topology on a set is a collection of subsets of having the following properties: and are in . The union of the elements of any subcollection of is in . The intersection of the elements of any finite subcollection of is in . A set for which a topology has been specified is called a topological space.

It is easy to construct an example of a topological space $X_t$ and a strict open subspace $U_t \subsetneq X_t$ with an abstract homeomorhism $\phi_t: U_t \cong X_t$ .

Can you give an elementary example of such $U$ where there is an abstract isomorphism $\phi: U \cong S$ of schemes? What about a scheme $X$ of finite type over a field $k$ ? As a consequence: If $U_t$ is the topological space of $U$ it follows there is a strict subset $U_t \subsetneq S_t$ with an abstract homeomorphism $\phi_t:U_t  \cong S_t$ . Note: Two schemes (or ringed spaces) $(X, \mathcal{O}_X), (Y, \mathcal{O}_Y)$ are ""isomorphic"" iff there are maps $f:(X, \mathcal{O}_X) \rightarrow (Y, \mathcal{O}_Y), g:(Y, \mathcal{O}_Y)\rightarrow  (X, \mathcal{O}_X)$ with $f\circ g =Id,g \circ f=Id$ . In particular the maps $f,g$ induce homeomorphisms of topological spaces $X \cong Y$ . If a strict  open subscheme $U \subsetneq V$ is abstractly isomorphic to $V$ you end up with a topological space $U_t \subsetneq V_t$ realizable as a strict subspace of $V_t$ , but where there is an abstract isomorphism $U_t \cong V_t$ . This stuation is ""paradoxical"" - the topological space $V_t$ would then be homeomorphic to a strict subspace of itself. Example: For the affine line $\mathbb{A}^1_k$ with $k$ an algebraically closed field, it follows there is no abstract isomorphism $\phi: U \cong \mathbb{A}^1_k$ for any strict open subscheme $U \subsetneq \mathbb{A}^1_k$ : Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field and let $A:=k[x]$ be the polynomial ring in one variable $x$ over $k$ . Let $$f(x):=(x-u_1)^{l_1}\cdots (x-u_m)^{l_m}$$ with $u_i \neq u_j\in k$ . Let $X:=Spec(A)$ and $U:=D(f) \subsetneq X$ be a strict open subscheme of $X$ and assume $X \cong D(f)$ is an abstract isomorphism of schemes over $k$ , induced by a map of $k$ -algebras $\tilde{\phi}: A \cong A_f$ . The map $\tilde{\phi}$ induce a map of $k$ -algebras $$\phi:k[x] \rightarrow k[x]$$ with $\phi(x)=a(x)$ and $\phi(f(x)):=f(a(x))\in k^*$ a unit. It follows $\phi(a(x)):=a_0\in k^*$ is a unit with $a_0\neq u_i$ for all $i$ . Hence the map $\phi$ factors as follows $$ k[x] \rightarrow k[x]/(x-a_0) \rightarrow k \subseteq k[x].$$ Hence the induced map $k[x]\rightarrow A_f \rightarrow A$ is the ""constant map"": The induced map of affine schemes $$ D(f) \rightarrow X$$ identifies $D(f) \cong \{(x-a_0)\} \subseteq X$ as a topological space with one point which contradicts the assumption that $D(f) \subseteq X$ is an open subscheme.

Here is my understanding of the proof, with some additional detail added by me. Define the map $(0,1) \to (0,1)^{\mathbb{N}}$ sending $x = 0.a_1 a_2 a_3 \ldots$ , written without terminating in an infinite string of nines, to the sequence $(s_1, s_2, s_3, \ldots)$ , where $s_k$ , by definition, takes the first available digit after the decimal point that hasn't already been enumerated in $s_1, \ldots, s_{k-1}$ and then increments by $2^k$ . For example, \begin{align*} s_1 & = a_1 a_3 a_5 a_7 a_9 \ldots \\ s_2 & = a_2 a_6 a_{10} a_{14} \ldots \\ s_3 & = a_4 a_{12} a_{20} a_{28} \ldots \\ & \vdots \\ \end{align*} This mapping is well-defined since we use the decimal expansion of $x$ not terminating in an infinite sequence of $9$ 's, which we know to be unique, and it's a bijection because it is invertible. Namely, given a sequence $(s_1, s_2, s_3, \ldots)$ , using the above construction, we can uniquely determination $x = 0.a_1 a_2 a_3 \ldots$ . How does this look?  The proof of bijectivity seems somewhat frail to me, though it does seem simple to me to reconstruct $x$ . The assertion that this decimal expansion is unique, while true, also seems a bit flimsy to me; if anyone can give a hint on how to prove that, this would be helpful.","I'm trying to understand a proof from my professor's lecture notes arguing that .
