Lemma a) The commutator subgroup $[G,G]$ of $G$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. b) The quotient group $G / [G,G]$ is the largest abelian quotient of G in the sense that every homomorphism $\varphi : G \to A$ where $A$ is an an abelian group, induces a unique homomorphism $\bar \varphi : G/[G,G] \to A$ so that $\varphi =\bar \varphi \circ \pi$ where $\pi : G \to G/[G,G]$ is the quotient homomorphism.

The following is well known: (Isomorphism Theorem for Finitely Generated Free Modules) [FGFM] $R^{n}\cong R^{m}$ as   $R$-modules if and only if $n=m$. One proof of this result (if I recall correctly) was somehow based on the idea that we can quotient out by a maximal ideal of $R$ (whose existence is guaranteed by Zorn's Lemma), and reduce the situation to that of vector spaces. However, I am interested in different approach. Recall (Nakayama's Lemma) Suppose $M$ is a finitely generated $R$-module, and   $M=IM$ where $I$ is an ideal contained in Jacobson radical of $R$. Then, $M=0$. My question is: Can we prove FGFM using Nakayama's Lemma? My main motivation in asking this question is two-fold: 1) to see the power and usefulness of Nakayama's Lemma, and 2) to see a nice and short proof of FGFM that does not involve reducing the problem to a result from linear algebra. I appreciate any input :)",,"['abstract-algebra', 'commutative-algebra', 'modules', 'alternative-proof']"

Prove that there exist a non-zero vector $v$ such that $L(v)=v$. I am trying to solve this in the context of group actions. Since $L^{p^k}=1$ the group generated by $L$ is cyclic of order $p^k,$ let's call it $G$.

Okay, now to conclude what I want I need to show that $L$ is an element of $Stab(v)$ for some non-zero $v$. It is equivalent to show that $Stab(v)=G$ for some $v$ or even that the $orb(v)=\{v\}$ for some non-zero $v$.

Then we have two options, either the order is $1$ which would imply that the action is transitive or the order is a non-zero power of $p$. But I don't know how to derive a contradiction from here. Another thing that I also though of was that this actions induces the homomorphism $\phi:G\to S_{\mathbb{F}_p^n}$ by setting $\phi(L^m)(v)=L^m(v)$. What I could prove was that $\phi$ is injective since $\phi(L^m)=1$ implies $\phi(L^m)(v)=v$ for all $v$, then $L^m(v)=v$ for all $v$ and then $L^m=1.$ From this we can see that $G$ is isomorphic to the group $\{L^m; m\in \mathbb{N}\}$.

63,Solving $x^{3} - 2 = 0$ and the field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})$,Solving  and the field,x^{3} - 2 = 0 \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2}),"Let's start with a simple polynomial $f(x) = x^{3} - 2 \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$. It is known that $f$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ and hence without any further information (i.e. working in field $\mathbb{Q}$ and ring $\mathbb{Q}[x]$) we can not distinguish the $3$ roots of $f$. The distinction between roots is only possible once we have the splitting field of $f$ available . Now consider the quotient $\mathbb{Q}[x]/(f(x))$ which is a field (because $f$ is irreducible) and this field contains a member $x + (f(x))$ which is a root of $f(x)$. Moreover this field is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})\subset \mathbb{R}$. Why is this extension field obtained using quotient by $(f(x))$ give us the real root $\sqrt[3]{2}$ and not one of the other two roots? I mean while taking the quotient with $f$ we are just getting an extension field which depends on $\mathbb{Q}$ and $f(x)$ and we don't know for sure which of the three roots it will contain. The same question however does not apply to all irreducible polynomials. Thus if we take $f(x) = x^{4} + x^{3} + x^{2} + x + 1$ (or more simply $x^{2} + 1$) then $\mathbb{Q}[x]/(f(x))$ contains all the roots of this polynomial. Update : For the simple polynomial $x^{2} + 1$ I can show that both of its roots are in the extension field $\mathbb{Q}[x] / (x^{2} + 1)$. With some reasonable effort we can show the same for $f(x) = x^{4} + x^{3} + x^{2} + x + 1$. I think we can also show that for $f(x) = x^{3} - 2$ the field $\mathbb{Q}[x]/(f(x))$ has only one root (I have not yet proved this for myself but I am sure I can). My real question is that even if we assume that this field has only one of the roots how do I know that this particular root is special and other two roots are more of a similar nature (ie this one is real and others are complex conjugates)? It appears I have been misunderstood so I add more formalism and details. Let $K$ be the splitting field of $x^{3} - 2 \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$. So $K$ has three elements $a, b, c$ each of which is a cube root of $2$ in $K$. Also we have $$K \supset \mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^{3} - 2) = L \supset \mathbb{Q}$$ My point is that the roots $a, b, c \in K$ are not indistinguishable from each other. Precisely we have one of these (say $a$) in $L$ and rest two ($b, c$) in $K$. Also there is automorphism $\sigma$ of $K$ which fixes $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\sigma(b) = c$. But there is no automorphism of $K$ which fixes $\mathbb{Q}$ and sends $a$ to $b$ (or $c$). I know this only by working in field $\mathbb{C}$. How do I know this without working in $\mathbb{C}$? Thanks to DonAntonio, I understood the flaw in my reasoning. Also sorry to other people who answered for bearing with my nonsense comments. What I gather from the overall discussion is this: Summary : The cubic $x^{3} - 2$ has three roots and they all lie in splitting field $K$. The intermediate field $L = \mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^{3} - 2)$ contains only one of the roots (see last part of egreg's answer as to why $L$ can't have all the roots) and it is not possible to determine via algebra as to which of $a, b, c$ lie in $L$. Thus $a, b, c$ are indeed indistinguishable and any one (say $a$) can be supposed to lie in $L$ and the rest lie in $K$. And we can then prove that $K = L(b) = L(c)$ and $L = \mathbb{Q}(a)$ and $L$ is of degree $3$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ and $K$ is of degree $2$ over $L$.

Show that every subset is partitioned into path-connected subsets with the property that two points in different subsets cannot be connected by a path in . Which of the following loci in are path-connected: For , I should test three properties: ""transitive"", ""symmetric"", ""reflexive"". The test of ""symmetric"" and ""reflexive"" are easy, and my work for ""transitive"" is as follows: transitive: ; . Then I construct a function , and we have . But after working with , I find that , which I have constructed , may not stay within the set . How should I construct it. For , I think it follows from , Since an equivalence relation on a set determines a partition of . Is that satisfied?

97,Why is studying maximal subgroups useful?,Why is studying maximal subgroups useful?,,"When looking at finite group theory research, it seems to me that a lot of energy is devoted to determining the maximal subgroups of certain classes of groups. For example, the O'Nan Scott theorem gives a classification of the maximal subgroups of $S_n$. There is an entire book ( link ) devoted to studying the maximal subgroups of simple classical groups. I'm pretty sure there are many other examples. Question: How does understanding the maximal subgroups of a group help us in understanding the structure of the group? Why should we care about maximal subgroups? This question is of course a bit vague. What I'm looking for is motivation and examples of applications. For example, I can see how the classification of finite simple groups (CFSG) is useful and interesting in group theory: every group is made up of simple groups (Jordan-Hölder), and CFSG is a very powerful tool for proving things. Many theorems have been proven with the following strategy: Step 1: Prove that a minimal counterexample is a finite simple group. Step 2: Check the theorem for each family of finite simple groups. So the importance of CFSG is clear. What I don't understand currently is why a group theorist would care about maximal subgroups or classifying them.","When looking at finite group theory research, it seems to me that a lot of energy is devoted to determining the maximal subgroups of certain classes of groups.
