0,Finding a stronger version of Cayley-Bacharach Theorem that applies in the case that the intersection multiplicities are not equal to $1$,Finding a stronger version of Cayley-Bacharach Theorem that applies in the case that the intersection multiplicities are not equal to,1,"Cayley–Bacharach theorem : Assume that two cubics $C_1$ and $C_2$ in the projective plane $\mathbb{P}^2$ meet in nine (different) points. Then every cubic that passes through any eight of the points also passes through the ninth point. Question (can be found in Gathmann's 2002 Algebraic Geometry notes): Can you find a stronger version of this statement (Cayley-Bacharach Theorem) that applies in the case that the intersection multiplicities in $C_1 \cap C_2$ are not equal to $1$? I proved Cayley-Bacharach theorem by two different ways and this is an exercise that I found in Gathmann's notes of Algebraic Geometry. He suggests to find a stronger statement for this theorem. Since this is interesting and could be used to prove the associativity of the addition law on elliptic curves, I research it and the best that I got is the following: Cubic Cayley-Bacharach Theorem : Let $C_1$ and $C_2$ be cubic curves in $\mathbb{P}^2$ without common components and assume that $C_1$ is smooth. Suppose that $C_3$ is another cubic curve that contains $8$ of the intersection points of $C_1 \cap C_2$ counting multiplicities. Then $C_3$ pass through the ninth point of $C_1 \cap C_2$.

3,27 lines on Fermat surface,27 lines on Fermat surface,,"I want to describe the $27$ lines on the Fermat surface and have found the information below. I don't understand the last part. How is it possible to go from $9$ different lines to $27$ different lines by changing the projective coordinates. Can somebody explain how you get the three last equations? Lemma 11.1. The Fermat cubic $X = V_p(x_0^3+x_1^3+x_2^3+x_3^3)\subset\mathbb P^3$ contains exactly 27 lines. Proof. Up to a permutation of coordinates, every line in $\mathbb P_3$ is given by two linear equations of the form $x_0 = a_2x_2 + a_3x_3$ and $x_1 = b_2x_2 + b_3x_3$ for suitable $a_2,a_3,b_2,b_3 \in \mathbb C$. Such a line lies in X if and only if $(a_2x_2 +a_3x_3)^3 + (b_2x_2 +b_3x_3)^3 +x_2^3+x_3^3 = 0$ as a polynomial in $\mathbb C[x_2, x_3]$ So by comparing coefficients, if and only if $$a_2^3 +b_2^3=-1 \dots (1)$$ $$a_3^3 +b_3^3=-1 \dots (2)$$ $$a_2^2a_3=-b_2^2b_3 \dots (3)$$ $$a_2a_3^2=-b_2b_3^2 \dots (4)$$ If $a_2,a_3,b_2,b_3$ are all non-zero, then $(3)^2/(4)$ gives $a_2^3=-b_2^3$ in contradiction to $(1)$ Hence for a line in the cubic at least one of these numbers must be zero. Again after possibly renumbering the coordinates we may assume that $a_2 = 0$. Then $b_2^3=-1$ by $(1)$; $b_3 = 0$ by $(3)$; and $a_3^3=-1$ by $(2)$ Conversely, for such values of $a_2,a_3,b_2,b_3$ the above equations all hold, so that we really obtain a line in the cubic. We thus obtain $9$ lines in $X$ by setting $b_2 = −\omega^j; a_3=-\omega^k$ for $0 \le j, k \le 2$ with $\omega = exp(\frac {2\pi i}3)$, a primitive third root of unity. So finally, by allowing permutations of the coordinates we find that there are exactly the following $27$ lines on $X$: $$x_0 +x_3\omega^k = x_1 +x_2\omega^j=0: 0 \le j, k \le 2$$ $$x_0 +x_2\omega^k = x_3 +x_1\omega^j = 0: 0 \le j, k \le 2$$ $$x_0 +x_1\omega^k = x_3 +x_2\omega^j = 0: 0 \le j, k \le 2$$ http://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/~gathmann/class/alggeom-2014/chapter-11.pdf","I want to describe the $27$ lines on the Fermat surface and have found the information below.

So my question is: are there any open questions or recent theory in tropical settings or similar that is comprehensible for an undergraduate to understand, investigate and perhaps speculate a bit about? I've heard that there is theory for transfering from normal geometry to tropical that maps multiplication to addition via the additivity of the logarithm and a limit process for the addition to maximum part, but I was unable to extract something along those lines from the articles google led me to. Basically, I'm looking for something that is new, but not super technical or overly messy. Is it perhaps better to investigate some related aspect of algebraic geometry? Any literature reference or insight into these branches of mathematics would be greatly appreciated. If you have a wildly different, but interesting suggestion for a subject you could share that too. For reference about the level I'm looking for, I'm familiar with subjects such as vector calculus, complex analysis, baby rudin level analysis, basic probability theory, linear algebra, basic fourier theory, basic abstract algebra and so on.","I'm worried this might not be fitting for this forum, but it's basically a literature and reference request.

Ravi Vakil points out on page 167 of FOAG that Each of the irreducible components of the support of any function   on a locally Noetherian scheme is the union of the closures of some subset of the   associated points. I am having a hard time coming up with a non-trivial example where the union does not consist of only one associated point. If $X$ were just the spectrum of a ring $A$, then no irreducible component of the support of any function could be written as the union of the closures of more than one associated point. This follows because if $C$ is an irreducible component of Supp $f$ then $C$ cannot be written as a finite union of proper closed subsets, and $A$ has only finitely many irreducible components. On the other hand, for a locally Noetherian scheme $X$, the associated points are those points $p ∈ X$ such that, on any affine open set Spec $A$ containing $p, p$ corresponds to an associated prime of $A$. This allows indeed for an irreducible component $C$ of the support of a function to be the union of the closure of more than one associated prime, since $C$ can extend pass any affine open (more precisely, there could be no affine open that contains $C$). To come up with an example, I first thought of projective space. But then, $\Gamma(\Bbb P^n_k,\mathcal O_{\Bbb P^n_k}) =k$ so the only thing I get is the empty set or the whole space as the support of any function. None of them would be the union of the closures of more than one associated prime, since the closure of a chart $\Bbb A^n_k$ is the whole projective space. My trivial example that works would be the union of two projective spaces. On the other hand, if Vakil used ""functions"" to mean not only section of the global, but also of smaller open sets (could anyone tell me?), then, maybe, it would be possible to produce non-reduced behaviour at the origin (much in the spirit of $k[x,y]/(y^2,xy)$) and at another point somewhere at infinity and pick function that has support on both points.

The coordinate ring of $C$ is $$K[C]=K[X,Y,Z]/(X^2+Y^2-Z^2)$$ with function field $K(C)=\text{Quot}(K[C])$. A rational map $\phi\in K(C)$ is regular at $P\in C$ if $\phi(P)$ is defined. $\phi$ is a morphism if it is regular at every $P\in C$. i.e. $\phi(C)\subseteq C$. In particular, $\phi=F/G$ where $F,G\in K[C]$ are homogeneous polynomials of the same degree. Some workings : $C$ is just the group of rational points in the circle.

So similar to elliptic curves, we can define $\phi=[m]$ to be the multiplication by $m$ map and $\phi$ is a morphism by the definitions above. For example, let $m=3$: $$\require{enclose}      \enclose{horizontalstrike}{[3](x,y,z)=(x^2-y^2,2xy,z^2)\oplus(x,y,z)=(x^4-6 x^2 y^2+y^4,4 x y (x^2-y^2),z^4)}$$ Edit_1 : $$[3](x,y,z)=(x^2-y^2,2xy,z^2)\oplus(x,y,z)=(x^3-3 x y^2,3 x^2 y-y^3,z^3)$$ and it is easy to check that $\phi$ is defined for all $P\in C$. Clearly we can also compose any two morphisms, so it suffices to find the ""different types"". Another morphism can be a translation. Fix a $Q\in C$, then define \begin{align*} \phi: C &\to C\\ P &\mapsto P\oplus Q \end{align*} It is clear that $\phi(P)\in C$ and is defined, so this seems to work. The main question is: are there other kind of morphisms and how do I find all of them? The only fact known to me would be that any morphism $\phi:C\to C$ is either constant or surjective. Some thoughts : In the case of an elliptic curve, if we want to set $\phi(\mathcal O)=\mathcal O$, then $\phi$ is an isogeny. It is known that this forces $\phi$ to be endomorphisms and  the endomorphism ring contains $\Bbb Z$ due to the scalar multiplications $[m]$. But there can also be complex multiplication when the endomorphism ring is larger than $\Bbb Z$. Can something similar happen here?

Then for nonzero $a \in A$ we have $l(M/aM) \le r \cdot l(A/aA)$ , where $l(\cdot)$ is the length function. Proof of Lemma: First assume that $M$ is finitely generated. Choose elements $\xi_1,\cdots,\xi_r \in M$ linearly independent over $A$ and set $E=\sum A\xi_i$ ; then for any $\eta \in M$ there exists $t \in A$ with $t\neq0$ such that $t \eta \in E$ ... ...If we set $C=M/E$ then from the assumption on $M$ we see that $C$ is also finitely generated, so that $t C=0$ for suitable nonzero $t \in A$ ...we can find $C=C_0 \supset C_1 \supset \cdots \supset C_m=0$ , such that $C_i/C_{i+1} \cong A/p_i$ with $p_i \in \operatorname{Spec}(A)$ .
