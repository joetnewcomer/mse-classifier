41,Is this a solution to the indefinite integral of $e^{-x^2}$?,Is this a solution to the indefinite integral of ?,e^{-x^2},"$\int e^{-x^2} \, \mathbb{d} x$, the Gaussian integral, is notorious throughout physics and statistics. Its definite integral defined over $\mathbb{R}$ is $\sqrt{\pi}$. However, the current indefinite integral is not an elementary solution. Recently I thought about an integration technique that uses ""error correcting."" If we define a function $f(x)$ such that $f^{(n)}(x)$ still contains terms from $f(x)$ (most likely $f(x)$ will always contain $e^x$), then we can take its derivative, set it up to attempt at the integral, and correct any errors until solution is satisfied. Here's how I went about it: $$\int e^{-x^2} \, \mathbb{d} x \\ \frac{\mathbb{d}}{\mathbb{d}x} [e^{-x^2}] = -2xe^{-x^2}$$ We can therefore take a naïve guess and state that: $$\int e^{-x^2} \, \mathbb{d} x = -\frac 1 {2x} e^{-x^2}$$ This isn't true, because differentiated, the result is: $$e^{-x^2} (1 + \frac 1 {2x^2})$$ Using this, we could try to subtract $\frac{e^{-x^2}}{2x^2}$ from our first approximation of the integral (again, naïve): $$\int e^{-x^2} \, \mathbb{d} x = e^{-x^2} (-\frac 1 {2x} - \frac 1 {2x^2})$$ Differentiating: $$e^{-x^2}(1 + x^{-1} + \frac 1 2 x^{-2} + x^{-3})$$ The last three terms seem pretty simple to take the integral of, so if we subtract the integral of those three terms from our guess, perhaps we could obtain the correct answer.

94,A doubt regarding change of variables in Double Integrals.,A doubt regarding change of variables in Double Integrals.,,"So I have recently learnt to calculate ""Double Integrals"" and I have a doubt on change of variables. Lets say we are evaluating a double integral of the form I = $\int\int _R F(x,y) dx dy $ , where $F(x,y)$ is an integrable smooth function and $R$ is the region of integration in the $xy$ plane. Now I want to convert to polar co-ordinates $x(r,\theta)=r \cos(\theta)$ and $y(r,\theta) = r \sin(\theta)$ . Now the region $R$ in the $xy$ palne can be suitably converted to some region $R'$ in the $r \theta$ plane. The function $F(x,y)$ may take the form of some smooth and integrable $G(r,\theta)$ . My main doubt is with the change of the area element. According to my textbook, $dx dy = \frac{\partial (x,y)}{\partial(r,\theta)} = rdrd\theta$ . So the area element in the $r\theta$ plane is $rdr d\theta$ . Now I want to experiment a little bit with my understanding : I write $dx = d(r\cos\theta) = -r\sin\theta d\theta + \cos \theta dr$ and $dy = d(r\sin\theta)=r\cos\theta d\theta + \sin\theta dr $ . And now I multiply the two expression for $dx$ and $dy$ : $dxdy= -r^2\sin\theta\cos\theta d\theta d\theta - r \sin^2 \theta drd\theta + r \cos^2 \theta dr d\theta + \sin \theta \cos\theta dr dr$ . Why isn't this expression equal to $rdrd\theta$ ? The $d\theta d\theta$ and $dr dr$ terms look very odd to me. Am I commiting some abuse of notation or something ? Also there are no higher order terms like $dr dr d\theta$ which I can ignore. I am totally confused with all this. Can someone explain this to me a bit clearly? Thanks in Advance :). EDIT 1 : I know differentials are not the ""usual"" kind of algebraic quantities and we can't just add and multiply them casually. I am just multiplying $dx$ with $dy$ with the spirit of multiplying some $\delta x$ and $\delta y$ and letting both $\delta x$ and $\delta y$ tend to zero.
