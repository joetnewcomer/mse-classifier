33,Which integration theory to use?,Which integration theory to use?,,"As far as I know the Lebesgue integral generalises the Riemann integral. One key ingredient to this generalisation is that the Lebesgue integral partitions the range, not the domain as in the Riemann theory, to obtain subsets of the domain. The sum of measures of the subsets is the evaluation of the (definite) integral. An upshot is that there is more freedom with the Lebesgue integral than with the Riemann integral (such as freely interchanging limits and integral sign, for example) My question is this: If I'm working with a (definite) integral which is Riemann integrable, then might it be helpful to apply the Lebesgue theory? For example, suppose the integral is proving tricky to evaluate. Could considering the integral as a Lebesgue integral possibly make the evaluation easier? I don't suppose this would help much with an indefinite integral since Lebesgue derives the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus from his theory which is ""the same as"" that of the Riemann theory.","As far as I know the Lebesgue integral generalises the Riemann integral. One key ingredient to this generalisation is that the Lebesgue integral partitions the range, not the domain as in the Riemann theory, to obtain subsets of the domain.

I was looking at the following post which was solved in a beautiful way Integrate $\int_0^{\pi/2} \frac{1}{1+\tan^\alpha{x}}\,\mathrm{d}x$ . From there I found this very interesting article http://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/mathdl/CMJ/Nelsen39-41.pdf which has the integral I posted at the end as a question to the reader. Looking at the graph of $\arctan(e^x)dx$ on the interval $-1 \leq x \leq 1$ I conjectured that $I=\frac{\pi}{2}$. I used the following method to prove it: \begin{eqnarray} -e^{-x}&=&\frac{-1}{e^x}\\&=& \frac{-1}{\tan\{   \arctan(e^x)  \} }\\&=&-\cot\{ \arctan(e^x) \}\\ &=& \tan \left\{\arctan(e^x)-\frac{\pi}{2} \right\}\\ \end{eqnarray} For the last equality I used the fact that $\cot(\theta) =-\tan\left(\theta -\frac{\pi}{2}\right) $. Now we take the arctan of both sides to obtain: $$\arctan(-e^{-x}) = \arctan(e^x)-\frac{\pi}{2}$$ Finally I use the fact that $\arctan(-\theta)=-\arctan(\theta)$ and add $\frac{\pi}{4}$ to both sides of the last equation to obtain: $$-\arctan(e^{-x})   +\frac{\pi}{4}= \arctan(e^x)-\frac{\pi}{4} $$ So it is established that the function $f(x) = \arctan(e^x)-\frac{\pi}{4}$ is an odd function. Thus $$I_2  = \int\limits_{-1}^{1}  \left[ \arctan(e^x)-\frac{\pi}{4} \right]dx = 0 $$ Now $$I =  \int\limits_{-1}^{1} \arctan(e^x)dx  = I_2 +  \int\limits_{-1}^{1} \frac{\pi}{4}dx =\frac{\pi}{2} $$ I thought this integral was really interesting and I was wondering if anyone else has any different ways of solving it, possibly with a clever substitution. I was especially amazed at how easily it could be solved because integrals with arctan usually give me a lot of trouble. Also, I think we can extend this to a broader result where we replace $x$ by any arbitrary odd function $g(x)$ and show that  $$I  = \int\limits_{-a}^{a} \arctan(e^{g(x)})dx = \frac{a \pi}{2}$$ for any odd function $f(x): (-a,a) \to\Bbb R$. Essentially the proof for this would follow the exact same reason as above right? So if anyone has another method of computing the original integral I am definitely interested in reading your solutions! Thanks in advance for any input and ideas!
