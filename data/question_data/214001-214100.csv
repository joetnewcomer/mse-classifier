4,Unusual result when comparing trigonometry and Pythagoras in triangles.,Unusual result when comparing trigonometry and Pythagoras in triangles.,,"I'm a Scottish Higher maths student. I was looking over some old textbooks, and came across a seemingly easy question, involving a circle within a triangle.

However, I was curious, and decided to solve it using trigonometry, the ""SOH CAH TOA"" method. Upon doing this, I received a different answer, and I don't understand why. This isn't urgent, I'm just curious! I've attached the question and my method below. Can anyone help? Question: An equilateral triangle has a circle inside it. The sides of the triangle are tangents to the circle. The radius of the circle is 2.4cm, and the distance from the centre of the circle to the vertex of the triangle is 5.1cm. Find the length of the triangle's side. As I mentioned, I used pythag to find half of the equilateral triangles side, making a right angled triangle with half of the equilateral triangle's side, the radius of the circle, and the known length between the circles centre and the corner. This gave me a result of 4.5cm. I then realised there were multiple ways to solve the same problem using trigonometry. I used sine, using the same triangle I used for the pythag, and using the rules of the triangles, I found that the top, unknown angle, was 60 degrees, as the corner of the equilateral triangle had to be 60 degrees, and the hypotenuse of my smaller triangle cut it in half, leaving the inner angle as 30 degrees.

I was taught, division of an equation by an expression which can be equal to zero can lead to missing roots. But I thought that this is not forbidden completely, cause always in such a situation I simply solved additional equation (which was a divider) and checked if its roots are roots of an initial equation. For example: $$ (x + 2)^2 + x + 2 = 0 $$ Dividing this by $( x + 2 )$ gives $$ x + 2 + 1 = 0 $$ so the root is $x = -3$, then I simply check whether the $ x + 2 = 0$ gives a root which fits the initial equation, and it does: $x = -2$. I do not have a great experience in mathematics, but I solved a couple of hundreds of equations more complex than this and never had a trouble. But today I encountered this issue. Here is the equation: $$ 3\sin(5z) -2\cos(5z) = 3 $$ I saw that $\cos(5z) = 0$ is the one of the solutions, but I divided all by it and got: $$ \begin{align} 3\tan(5z) - 2 &= 3 \\ 3\tan(5z) &= 5 \\ \tan(5z) &= \frac{5}{3} \\ 5z &= \arctan(\frac{5}{3}) + \pi k , k \in \mathbb{Z} \\ z &= \frac{\arctan(\frac{5}{3}) + \pi k}{5}, k \in \mathbb{Z} \end{align} $$ the second root is: $$ \begin{align} \cos(5z) &= 0 \\ z = \frac{\frac{\pi}{2} + \pi k}{5} &= \frac{\pi (1 + 2 k)}{10}, k \in \mathbb{Z} \end{align} $$ But the first one is not a real root for some reason. This was the first thing which confused me here, I knew that I can lose a root but I never found parasite ones in similar situations. I was taught that parasite roots can appear only when doing a multiplication by an expression which can be equal to zero or an exponentiation to an even exponent, not in the cause of a division. The second confusion is the fact that I actually have lost some roots, cause the right solution from the textbook was (with the introduction of the so called auxiliary angle $\sqrt{3^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{13} \implies \gamma = \arcsin(\frac{3}{\sqrt{13}})$): $$ \begin{align} \underbrace{\frac{3}{\sqrt{13}}}_{\sin(\gamma)} \ sin(5z) - \underbrace{\frac{2}{\sqrt{13}}}_{\cos(\gamma)} \ cos(5z) &= \frac{3}{\sqrt{13}} \\ \sin(\gamma)\sin(5z) - \cos(\gamma)\cos(5z) &= \frac{3}{\sqrt{13}} \\ \cos(\gamma + 5z) &= -\frac{3}{\sqrt{13}} \\ z &= \pm \frac{1}{5}\arccos(-\frac{3}{\sqrt{13}}) - \frac{1}{5}\arcsin(\frac{3}{\sqrt{13}}) + \frac{2\pi k}{5} \end{align} $$ So I actually have two questions: Is it possible to lose roots permanently when dividing an equation by an expression which may be equal to zero ?

I'm making a space game.  So far I have a spaceship that has a maximum velocity (kept in check by a function that finds the hypotenuse of the triangle made by its vx and vy and ensures that the length of the hypotenuse never surpasses the max_speed), and proper acceleration implemented (as well as proper tracking of angle of rotation in order to generate the vx and vy values).  It flies quite nicely.  What I'm having trouble with is finding the current angle of motion, as opposed to the current angle the ship is facing. I know that, for a right triangle, I can find the theta (angle/slope) by calculating the arctangent of the length of the opposite side divided by the length of the adjacent side.

The ship could be moving in the exact opposite direction and it would give me the same angle. I was thinking of writing a function to modify the output depending on which quadrant the motion was facing.  For instance: if vx and vy were both negative, then the angle should be between 270 and 360, or if they were both positive, between 90 and 180.  The only issue is the reflection of the result across the axes.  I rotate clockwise from 0 degrees, and it counts down from 90 to 0, then down to -90 when I reach the 180 mark, then back up from -90 to 0 as I approach 270, and from 0 to 90 as I pass 270 and on to 360. Is there any formula I can use, into which I can input my current x speed and y speed, and receive the angle, between 0 and 359 (or 1 and 360, whichever works)?

So I came across this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R476CTKUIr4 in which the creator shows an incorrect proof of π = 0 and the mistake made. The video proves this using the exponent rule and shows that it cannot be applied to imaginary numbers. Here are the first few steps from the video which lead me to prove π = 0 (a different way) and I am wondering why this way is also wrong. e^(iπ) +1 = 0 e^(iπ) = -1 [e^(iπ)]^2 = 1 e^(2iπ) = 1  -> True, checked using WolframAlpha e^(2iπ) = e^0 2iπ = 0 iπ = 0 So either i = 0 or π = 0, and both are incorrect.

76,Fundamental definition of trigonometric functions,Fundamental definition of trigonometric functions,,"What is the most basic or fundamental definition of a trigonometric function, (say sine)? How is sine of an angle defined? I looked up on wikipedia, and it seems that sine of an angle stems from this definition: In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. If sine is a ratio of lengths, then how can it ever be negative? I'm assuming of course that the length is always positive. Correct me if I'm mistaken. Now please refer to this video at 8:52 on khanacademy: https://www.khanacademy.org/math/trigonometry/less-basic-trigonometry/trig_iden_tutorial/v/trig-identities-part-2-parr-4-if-you-watch-the-proofs Even if lengths may be negative (which I doubt), then while calculating cos(-a) in the video, why do we take the negative of opposite side but don't do anything to hypotenuse?

How is sine of an angle defined? I looked up on wikipedia, and it seems that sine of an angle stems from this definition: In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. If sine is a ratio of lengths, then how can it ever be negative? I'm assuming of course that the length is always positive. Correct me if I'm mistaken. Now please refer to this video at 8:52 on khanacademy: https://www.khanacademy.org/math/trigonometry/less-basic-trigonometry/trig_iden_tutorial/v/trig-identities-part-2-parr-4-if-you-watch-the-proofs Even if lengths may be negative (which I doubt), then while calculating cos(-a) in the video, why do we take the negative of opposite side but don't do anything to hypotenuse?

I understand the tangent values (sine/cosine according to right angle ratios) and the why the cosine values are in ""the opposite order"" of sine values (due to the cosine function being a $90^\circ$ phase shift on the  sine function) but why does doing the above trick provide the correct values for sine (and cosine in opposite order)?","There exists a common trick to remember exact sine cosine and tangent values.
