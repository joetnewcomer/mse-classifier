But, anyways, I was curious if this was true, or if he made a mistake, I tried something: Firstly, we know that $f$ may be injective, because if $g \in ker(f)$ then $1 =f(g)$ is conjugate to $g$ then $g=1$ , so $ker(f) = 1$ . Then I proved something else: Firstly if we consider $f: G \rightarrow Imf$ , we may have that $f$ is an isomorphism. It's true, since $f$ in injective as we proved, and surjective by the restriction of counter-domain. And actually, if we consider $f|_{Im(f^n)} : Im(f^n) \rightarrow Im(f^{n+1})$ would be an isomorphism by the same argument. Then I tried to obtain some information about the orbits. I did this by proving the following statement about $f$ : $\textbf{Statement}$ : Let $g \in G$ , and $O(g)$ the orbit or conjugacy class of $g$ . If $O(g)$ is finite then $g \in Im(f)$ and exists some $i>0$ such that $f^i(g) = g$ $\textbf{Proof}$ : Since $O(g)$ is finite   and $f^n(g) \in O(g)$ for all $n$ then we must have $i,j$ , $i<j$ such that $f^i(g) = f^j(g)$ . Then, we have $f^i(g) = f^i(f^{j-i}(g)) \Rightarrow  g = f^{j-i}(g)$ because $f^i$ will be injective as is compose of injective functions. Since $i<j$ we must have $i \leq j-1$ then $j-i-1 = j-1-i \geq 0$ , so $f(f^{j-i-1}(g))  = g$ then $g \in Im(f)$ So if $f$ is not surjective then we must have an infinity conjugacy class. I also proved a corollary of the previous statement that is: if $g \not \in Im(f)$ then there isn't $a_1, ... ,a_k \in G$ all with finite conjugacy class such that $ g= a_1 \cdot ... \cdot a_k$ . It's true, otherwise it'd exist $i_1,... i_k$ such that $f^{i_l}(a_l) = a_l$ . Then we would have $f^{i_1 \cdot ... \cdot i_k}(g) = f^{i_1 \cdot ... \cdot i_k}(a_1 ... a_k) =  f^{i_1 \cdot ... \cdot i_k}(a_1) \cdot ... \cdot  f^{i_1 \cdot ... \cdot i_k}(a_k) = a_1 \cdot ... \cdot a_k = g$ and this would imply that $g \in Im(f)$ . Then corollary of corollary: if we multiply g in the left or in the right by elements whose inverse has finite conjugacy class then it may not have finite conjugacy class: for example if $a^{-1}$ has finite conjugacy class then if $ag$ had finite conjugacy class then, we would have a contradiction, since $g = a^{-1}(ag)$ I also tried something involving the left-inverse but I couldn't achieve any further. I'd like to know if this is true or has some counter-examples.","I was at a class, when the teacher used the following statement to prove some facts: is a group and such that is conjugate to for all then .

For example, if is 45 degree rotation of the plane, and is reflection along the vertical-axis, then the conjugate of with will give you a rotated reflection, i.e. a reflection along the diagonal. (Hence, the -conjugate operation rotates the operation itself, rather than the plane on which is acting). I do not have a similar intuitive understanding of what the commutator does in a permutation group. I went through a number of examples, and couldn’t find the common pattern.

26,Flaw in my classification of groups of order 2015,Flaw in my classification of groups of order 2015,,"In an attempt to classify groups of order $2015 = 5 \cdot 13 \cdot 31$, I deduced that only $\mathbb{Z}/2015 \mathbb{Z}$ was the only such group. I then checked with some sources that informed me that there are two groups of order 2015 (up to isomorphism) so I was wondering what the flaw in my proof is. I approached the problem as follows: Let $G$ be a group of order 2015. It is easy to apply Sylow's theorems to show that the Sylow-13 and the Sylow-31 subgroups are normal in $G$; so let $P_{13}$ and $P_{31}$ denote the Sylow-13 and Sylow-31 subgroups, respectively. Also let $P_{5}$ denote a Sylow-5 subgroup. Since $P_{31}$ is normal, $P_{31}P_{5}$ is a subgroup of order $5 \cdot 31$ in $G$. Now since $P_{13}$ is normal, we have that $P_{13} (P_{31} P_{5})$ is a subgroup of order $13 \cdot 31 \cdot 5$ in $G$; hence $G = P_{13} (P_{31} P_{5})$. Thus since $P_{13} \cap (P_{31} P_{5}) = \{ e\}$, $P_{13}$ is normal, and $G = P_{13} (P_{31} P_{5})$, we have that $G = P_{13} \rtimes_{\theta} P_{31}P_{5}$. Now since $\operatorname{Aut}(P_{13}) \cong \mathbb{Z} /12 \mathbb{Z} $ and $|P_{31} P_{5}|$ is relatively prime to 12, $\theta : P_{31} P_{5} \rightarrow \operatorname{Aut}(P_{13})$ must be trivial. Hence $G = P_{13} \times P_{31} P_{5}$. Now I assumed since $P_{5}$ and $P_{31}$ are both cyclic there product would be as well, but I am guessing this is where the flaw in my proof is. This is further supported by the fact that there is two groups of order 155. How can I see that there are two possibilities for $P_{5}P_{31}$ and conclude that there are only two groups of order 2015?","In an attempt to classify groups of order $2015 = 5 \cdot 13 \cdot 31$, I deduced that only $\mathbb{Z}/2015 \mathbb{Z}$ was the only such group.

I mean in this example it is easy since there are two nonequivalent extensions, $\mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_2$ and $\mathbb Z_4$ and I look at the subgroup lattice of $D_4$ to find corresponding subgroups. But how would I go about this in general, e.g. in the next example. 3) Consider another example: $\mathbb Z_2 \wr \mathbb Z_3$. My understanding of this group is this: the base is $H = \mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_2$ with $G = \mathbb Z_3$ acting on the base by shifting the entries of a triple. Then the wreath product is the semidirect product $H \rtimes G$ wrt this shifting action. It is a group of order $2^3 \cdot 3 = 24$ elements.  But this is about it how I understand this group. Are there easy observations to be made immediately about this group (just by definition)?",,"['group-theory', 'cyclic-groups', 'sylow-theory', 'dihedral-groups', 'wreath-product']"

71,Free objects in $\mathrm{Set}(G).$,Free objects in,\mathrm{Set}(G).,"What are the free objects in the category of $G$-sets for a group $G$? After considerable deliberation (I'm not very bright), I'm pretty sure they are the $G$-sets $X$ on which $G$ acts freely, that is in such a way that only $e$ fixes any elements in $X$. I can prove it -- almost. Suppose $X$ is a $G$-set on which $G$ acts freely. Let's take a transversal $B$ of the set of orbits $X/G$. I will show that $X$ is a free object in the category of $G$-sets, and $B$ is its basis. Let $Y$ be an arbitrary $G$-set, and let $f:B\to Y$ be any function. Suppose $\tilde f:X\to Y$ is a $G$-set morphism extending $f$. Let $x\in X$. Then there exist $b\in B$ and $g\in G$ such that $gb=x.$ Then $$\tilde f(x)=\tilde f(gb)=g\tilde f(b)=gf(b).$$ Hence the extension $\tilde f$ is unique. For the existence of $\tilde f$, it's enough to check that the above is a good definition, or that it doesn't depend on the choice of $g$. Suppose $gb=x$ and $g'b=x$. Then $b=g^{-1}g'b$, and since $G$ acts freely on $X$, we must have $g=g'.$ Therefore the extension $\tilde f$ exists and is unique, and so $X$ is a free object in the category of $G$-sets. Now suppose $X$ is a free object in the category of $G$-sets. Suppose for a moment that the following lemma is true. Lemma. If $X$ is a free object in the category of $G$-sets, then its bases are exactly the transversals of $X/G.$ With this lemma I can show that $G$ must act freely on $X$. For let $x\in X.$ Then there exist a (unique, but I don't think I need this) $b\in B$ and $g\in G$ such that $gb=x.$ Suppose for an $h\in G$ we have $hx=x.$ This means that $$g^{-1}hgb=b.$$ Now let $f:B\to G$ be any function. Since $B$ is a basis, we can extend it uniquely to a $G$-set morphism $\tilde f$. ($G$ acts on itself by multiplication.) This implies that $$g^{-1}hgf(b)=f(b).$$ But $f(b)$ can be chosen arbitrarily, which means that $g^{-1}hg$ must fix every element of $G$, and so $h=e.$ So what I need to do is prove the lemma. Actually, I just need the ""exactly"" part. I just need to know that if $X$ is a free object in the category $G$-sets, then its basis must be a transversal of $X/G.$ Suppose $X$ is a free object. A transversal is a subset of $X$ such that there is exactly one element of each orbit in it. I think the uniqueness is analogous to linear independence in a vector space, and the existence is analogous to spanning the whole space. I can show the uniqueness (but as I said, I don't think I need it actually). Suppose $B$ is a basis of $X$. Suppose there are $b,b'\in B$ such that $b'=gb$ for some $g$. Again, by considering the functions $f:B\to G$, I can show that $g=e.$ But I don't see how to show that every orbit must have a representative in $B$. (Please keep in mind that at this point I still haven't proven that $G$ acts freely on $X$.) Since this is analogous to the fact that a vector space basis must generate the whole space, I've looked at the proof of that, the one in which we generate a subspace by the basis, quotient it out and show that the quotient is $0$. Can it be done here? I don't know how to define a quotient of a $G$-set. Or maybe I just need to prove it in some other way?","What are the free objects in the category of $G$-sets for a group $G$?

For let $x\in X.$ Then there exist a (unique, but I don't think I need this) $b\in B$ and $g\in G$ such that $gb=x.$ Suppose for an $h\in G$ we have $hx=x.$ This means that $$g^{-1}hgb=b.$$ Now let $f:B\to G$ be any function. Since $B$ is a basis, we can extend it uniquely to a $G$-set morphism $\tilde f$. ($G$ acts on itself by multiplication.) This implies that $$g^{-1}hgf(b)=f(b).$$ But $f(b)$ can be chosen arbitrarily, which means that $g^{-1}hg$ must fix every element of $G$, and so $h=e.$ So what I need to do is prove the lemma. Actually, I just need the ""exactly"" part. I just need to know that if $X$ is a free object in the category $G$-sets, then its basis must be a transversal of $X/G.$ Suppose $X$ is a free object. A transversal is a subset of $X$ such that there is exactly one element of each orbit in it. I think the uniqueness is analogous to linear independence in a vector space, and the existence is analogous to spanning the whole space. I can show the uniqueness (but as I said, I don't think I need it actually). Suppose $B$ is a basis of $X$. Suppose there are $b,b'\in B$ such that $b'=gb$ for some $g$. Again, by considering the functions $f:B\to G$, I can show that $g=e.$ But I don't see how to show that every orbit must have a representative in $B$. (Please keep in mind that at this point I still haven't proven that $G$ acts freely on $X$.) Since this is analogous to the fact that a vector space basis must generate the whole space, I've looked at the proof of that, the one in which we generate a subspace by the basis, quotient it out and show that the quotient is $0$. Can it be done here? I don't know how to define a quotient of a $G$-set. Or maybe I just need to prove it in some other way?",,"['group-theory', 'category-theory', 'group-actions']"
72,Groups acting on polytopes,Groups acting on polytopes,,"I am currently reading the paper ""Polytopal Resolutions for Finite Groups"" [1] by Graham Ellis, James Harris and Emil Skoeldberg and have a question regarding an early remark of theirs. Their basic setup is as follows: They take a finite group $G$ acting faithfully, linearly and orthogonally on Euclidean space ($E=\mathbb{R}^n$) and a vector $v \in E$ such that $gv \neq v$ holds for all $g \neq 1$ in $G$. Then they consider the convex hull $P(G,v)$ of $Gv$ which is obviously a polytope (since $G$ is finite) and therefore a natural CW-Complex. The group acts on $P(G,v)$ by permuting faces in each dimension and we can conclude that the cellular chain complex $C_*(P)$ is in fact a complex of $\mathbb{Z}G$-modules (I am actually somewhat unclear on the definition of the corresponding differential but luckily there are algorithms that can compute it if necessary). My problem starts when they describe the action on $C_k(P)$: The module $C_k(P)$ is $\mathbb{Z}$-free (not necessarily $\mathbb{Z}G$-free) with free generators which can be identified with the $k$-faces of $P(G)$ and $G$-action $ge=\pm f$ if $g$ maps the $k$-face $e$ to $f$ with sign depending on the orientation with which $g$ maps $e$ to $f$. I am quite unsure about the meaning of this. If I have a $1$- or a $2$-face I can give it an orientation in a somewhat natural way but what is the orientation of some $5$-face of a polytope in dimension $8$ (e.g.). Even if there was a way to give each $k$-face an orientation wouldn`t the choice be kind of arbitrary? What confuses me most is the implementation: In the HAP-package for the computer algebra system Gap there is an algorithm which computes $C_*(P)$ for given $G$ and $v$. Among other things a function ""action($k,j,g$)"" is computed with output $\pm1$ depending on how the element $g$ acts on the permutation on the cell ""j"" in dimension $k$. However if you have a look at the code you can see that the output does not depend on $k$ and $j$ at all but merely on the property of $g$ to belong to the subgroup $G_{ev}$ which is generated by all products of two generators of $G$ (the generating set for $G$ being computed via a Gap-command). This is not even invariant under the choice of the generating system. Why should the action on the orientation only depend on this choice of a generating system? Thanks in advance for any help.

90,Interpretations of the Correspondence Theorem (4th Isomorphism Theorem),Interpretations of the Correspondence Theorem (4th Isomorphism Theorem),,"I know of this version of the correspondence theorem for Groups (From Herstein's Abstract Algebra ): ''Let $\phi$ be a group homomorphism from G onto G' with kernel $K$. If $H' \leq G'$ and $H = \{ a \in G : \phi(a) \in H '\}$, then $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ that contains $K$ and $H/K \cong H'$. To illustrate this, consider the following homomorphism $\phi$ from $S_4$ to $S_3$: Partition the set of 4 indices $\{1,2,3,4\}$ into pairs of subsets in the following way: $\Pi_1 = \{1,2\} \cup \{3,4\}$ $\Pi_2 = \{1,3\} \cup \{2,4\}$ $\Pi_3 = \{1,4\} \cup \{2,3\}$. Then take say the cycle $(1234)$ in $S_4$ and let it act on each of the $\Pi_i's$. It should be immediate that $(1234)$ switches $\Pi_1$ and $\Pi_3$ while fixing $\Pi_2$. So we see can define $\phi$ by the action of $(1234)$ on the $\Pi_i's$ (I don't even know if this is correct terminology). In addition we see that $(1234)$ is mapped to $(13)(2)$ in $S_3$. So now if I consider the subgroup $H' = \{e, (12)\}$ of $S_3$, we can see that the kernel of $\phi$ contains the elements $\{e, (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23) \}$. So if we form the quotient $H/K$, it will just  contain the elements $\{ [e], [(1324)] \}$. It is then apparent that $H/K$ is isomorphic to $H'$. However I also know that there is a one to one correspondence between the subgroups of $S_4$ containing the kernel and $S_3$. For example another such correspondence would be between the alternating group $A_4 \leq S_4$ and the subgroup in $S_3$ generated by the cycle $(123)$.

We know its fundamental group is the free group with two elements, $\pi_1(R_2)=F_2=\langle a,b\rangle$ . Now given some subgroup $H=\langle a^3,ba,aba^2,a^2b^2a \rangle$ . I want to find the covering space $X_H$ of $X$ associated to $H$ by the Galois Correspondence of subgroups and covering spaces. I know the universal covering space $\widetilde{X}$ of the rose of $n$ -petals is the Cayley Graph of the free group on $n$ elements. Moreover, I know that to get $X_H$ we quotient the $\widetilde{X}$ by $[\gamma]~[\gamma']$ whenever $\gamma(1)=\gamma'(1)$ and $[\gamma\gamma'^{-1}]\in H$ , since we may see $\widetilde{X}$ as the space of paths to $R_2$ . Still, I was not able to use this fact to obtain a concrete graph $X_H$ . I wonder if there's a general procedure to obtain our space $X_H$ given a graph $H$ , or, at least, in this specific case.","Let the rose with petals, that is the wedge of with itself.
