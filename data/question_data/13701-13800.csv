This was EXTREMELY troublesome, and is the main reason why I found this problem challenging, because of all the steps. Can you guys show me the easiest and especially quickest way to get this derivative? After that, I filled in $-1$ in the derivative and made the derivative equal to $2\dfrac{1}{2}$, this was also troublesome for me, I kept getting wrong answers for a while, again: Can you guys show me the easiest and especially quickest way to solve this ? After you get p it is pretty straightforward. I know this might sound like a weird question, but it basically boils down to: I need quicker and easier ways to do this. I don't want to make careless mistakes, but because the length of these types of question, it ALWAYS happens. Any tips or tricks regarding this topic in general would be much appreciated too. Update: A bounty will go to the person with the most clear and concise way of solving this question!",,"['calculus', 'algebra-precalculus', 'derivatives']"

20,$\epsilon$-$\delta$ limits of functions question,- limits of functions question,\epsilon \delta,"I'm studying how to write epsilon-delta proofs for limits of sequences, limits of functions, continuity, and differentiability and I'm having trouble with the general methodological procedure used in some of the proofs in the text as opposed to some of the proofs I have come up with. I'm going to post an example question with the proof I came up with and the proof given by the book. If possible, could you comment on how my proof is insufficient to prove the result, because I don't understand why it isn't. I understand the definition of the limit of a function to be the following: $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = L$ means, $\forall \epsilon >0, \exists \delta >0; 0 < |x-a|< \delta \Rightarrow |f(x) - L|< \epsilon$, with $x, a, L \in \mathbb{R}$. Question: Give an $\epsilon$-$\delta$ proof that $\lim_{x \rightarrow 2} x^3 =8$. My Proof: Let $\epsilon > 0$ be arbitrary and for $\delta = (\epsilon +8)^\frac{1}{3} -2$ assume that $ 0 < |x-2| < \delta$, with $x \in \mathbb{R}$. Then,    $$|x-2| < (\epsilon +8)^\frac{1}{3} -2$$   $$x-2 < (\epsilon + 8)^\frac{1}{3} -2 $$   $$x< (\epsilon +8)^\frac{1}{3}$$   $$x^3 < \epsilon +8$$   $$x^3 - 8 < \epsilon$$   $$|x^3 - 8| < \epsilon$$   Therefore, for $f(x) = x^3$ and $L = 8$, we have shown $|f(x) -L| < \epsilon$ and resultantly $\lim_{n \rightarrow 2} x^3 = 8$. Book's Proof: Let $\epsilon >0$ be given and choose $\delta = \min(1, \frac{\epsilon}{19})$. Let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $0 < |x-2| < \delta = \min(1,\frac{\epsilon}{19})$. Since $|x-2|<1$, it follows that $ -1 < x-2 < 1$ and so $1 <x<3$. Thus $|x^2 + 2x +4| < 19$. Because $|x-2| < \frac{\epsilon}{19}$, it follows that $|x^3 - 8| = |x-2||x^2 + 2x +4| < 19|x-2|< 19(\frac{\epsilon}{19})=\epsilon$. Aren't we trying to show that given our assumption that $0 < |x-a|< \delta$ we need to show that $|f(x) - L|< \epsilon$. That is all that is required right? We pick some $\delta$ for which this works? I'm able to follow to proof in the book and understand that it is correct, I just don't understand why all of the additional details are necessary.

Here is how I originally proved it: Begin with the known result $$\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{x \ln x}{e^{2 \pi x}-1} \, dx = \frac{1}{2} \zeta'(-1)=\frac{1}{24}-\frac{1}{2} \ln A$$ then use the following well-known property of the Laplace transform $$\int_{0}^{\infty} f(x) g(x) \, dx = \int_{0}^{\infty} \left( \mathcal{L} f\right) (y) \left( \mathcal{L}^{-1} g \right) (y) \, dy$$ Let $f(x) = \frac{x^2}{e^{2 \pi x} - 1}$ and $g(x) = \frac{\ln x}{x}$ then: $$\left(\mathcal{L} f\right) (y) = -\frac{1}{8 \pi^3} \psi^{(2)} \left(1+\frac{y}{2\pi}\right)$$ $$\left(\mathcal{L}^{-1} g\right)(y) = -\gamma - \ln (y)$$ $$\implies \frac{1}{24} - \frac{1}{2} \ln A = \frac{1}{8\pi^3}\int_{0}^{\infty} \gamma \, \psi^{(2)} \left(1+\frac{y}{2\pi}\right) \, dy + \frac{1}{8\pi^3} \int_{0}^{\infty} \psi^{(2)} \left(1+\frac{y}{2\pi}\right) \ln (y) \, dy$$ Proceed with the substitution $y \mapsto 2\pi x \implies dy = 2 \pi\,dx$ $$\implies \frac{1+\gamma}{24} - \frac{1}{2} \ln A = \frac{1}{4\pi^2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \psi^{(2)} \left(1+x\right) \ln (2 \pi x) \, dx$$ Now separate $\ln (2\pi x) = \ln (2 \pi) + \ln (x)$ and the result quickly follows. I was wondering if there are any alternative methods that don't rely on the initial $\frac{1}{2} \zeta'(-1)$ result. Motivation: I've been experimenting with the following identity: $$\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{x^{2n-1}}{e^{2\pi x}-1}\, dx = \frac{(-1)^{n-1} B_{2n}}{4n}\,\text{ for } n \in \mathbb{N}$$ I noticed that if one takes the partial derivative with respect to $n$ and then proceeds to take the limit as $n \to 1$ , then we arrive at our $-\frac{1}{2} \zeta'(-1)$ result. This means it is possible for one to define the 'derivative' of the Bernoulli numbers at $n=1$ . More precisely: $$B_{2}^{\prime} = \frac{1}{4} - 2 \ln A$$ is this result already known, and if so, are any other Bernoulli derivatives definable in a similar way using the Glaisher-Kinkelin constant? (I know it is possible to do it with Glaisher-Kinkelin-like constants such as the Bendersky-Adamchik constants due to their similar connection to hyperfactorials, $\zeta'(-2)$ and $\zeta(3)$ for example). I'm not sure what meaning one can give to the 'derivative' of the Bernoulli numbers, but figure 2 of this paper seems to roughly agree with my result.","I'm looking for alternate methods of proving the following result: Where is the polygamma function, is the Glaisher-Kinkelin constant and is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.

58,Series expanding from integral?,Series expanding from integral?,,"I have a specific question with regards to an integral like this one, for example: $\int(x^6)cos(3x)dx$ I noticed that this solves out to: $= (x^6)(\frac{1}{3}\sin(3x) ) - (6x^5)(-\frac{1}{9}\cos(3x) ) $ ....... (it goes on a while) As I'm a student who (admittedly) failed Calculus II the first time and am retaking it and using your notes to practice, I wanted to challenge myself to writing a general series for solving all problems of the type: $$\int (x^a)\cos(b*x)dx$$ where: a is a real integer constant b is a real constant a > 0 so, from the previous problem: a=6, b=3 I understand that this series would start with sum(n=1, a) but I don't know where to go from there. I also have a few questions about how I would go about doing this: How do I alternate between cos and sin? For example: $\cos(...) + \sin(...) + \cos(...) + \sin(...) ...$ This series seems to start at n=6 and count downwards towards $n=1$ . How do I work around this problem, as (as far as I'm aware) series need to count up? More broadly, beyond this series thing, is there any other way of simplifying the work required in a problem like this, where: $\int(x^{\text{some power}} * \cos(...) dx)$ So that I won't have to go through the process of integrating by parts every little thing into the table, and then putting it all together, since that's super time intensive and I my biggest problem last semester was not doing my math quick enough? I also understand that I might have to write a different counterpart series for any integral like $\int(x^a)\sin(b*x) dx$ Final note: I'm aware that there's such a thing as ""series expansion of an integral"" but I don't know anything about it, as we haven't covered it in class yet. I understand that if I followed those methods, I could probably do this no problem, but I wanted to challenge myself for the sake of practice. EDIT: So now that I've worked on it for a little bit, I've broken it into parts a little more: alternate sin/cos: $$\sum_{n=0}^a\frac{(-1)^n(x^{2n}+(-\frac{\pi}{2}+x)^{2n})}{(2n)!}$$ which I figured out from extensively playing around with desmos and the equations alternate + or -: $$(-1)^n $$ the first term: So the first term, going from the end of the integral $(720)(-(1/2187) \sin(3y))$ forward, should therefore be $720$ . $720$ in this case is $6!$ , so I can describe this in my series as $a!$ . However I've gotten stuck here. For all terms after $n=0$ , there is a pattern of $\frac{a!}{n!}$ but at $n=0$ , I can't do that. Is there a way I can keep this pattern, but make it so that when n=0, that denominator becomes $1$ , as it is? So basically this would work if: $\frac{720}{0} = 720$ , $\frac{720}{1} = 720$ , $\frac{720}{2} = 360$ , $\frac{720}{6} = 120...$ so I need that 0 there to act like a $1$ . How would I do this? second term: for the second term, I can say: $$-\frac{1}{b^{a+1-n}}(...)$$ where (...) is the alternating sin(bx) or cos(bx). I wonder if putting that entire sum from above in here would actually work though, or if I'd have to figure it out more there. So I need more help with the ""first term"" section and possibly with the ""second term"" section. Thank you!

But most importantly, it doesn't work. The terms do not come out to $(720)(-1/2187\sin(3x)) - (720x)(-1/729\cos(3x)) +.... + (x^6)(1/3\sin(3x))$ as they should. So what did I do wrong here?

I know the usual response to this is that it's equivalent when $f(x)$ is analytic but that doesn't help me at all because it says the function is analytic when the Taylor series around $x_0$ converges to the function in a neighborhood around $x_0$ for all $x_0$ in the function's domain. But how do I know this? Yet again feels circular... just working through these two examples makes me wonder, how do I know these series converge to the function itself? How do I know they're equivalent representations? Am I supposed to avoid the self-referencing? I'm looking for some context behind how to make sense of these two Taylor series and how I am supposed to know that $e$ is analytic or that I can use $S(x)$ for any $x$ I want even if I only computed it for the neighborhood around $x=0$.",,"['calculus', 'sequences-and-series', 'taylor-expansion', 'exponential-function', 'analytic-functions']"

The quantity on the left is the area between $f(x)$ and the horizontal line at $f(a)$ from $a$ to $b$.  The quantity on the right is the area of the right triangle of base and height $b-a$ (or viewed as an integral it is $\int_a^b x dx$).  The condition on $f$ we are given in the hypothesis of the theorem roughly states that the change in $f$ over any interval must be less than the change in $x$ (or the width of the interval).  So, we have a function $f$ that is changing less than linearly over $[a,b]$; hence, the integral of the function will be $\leq$ than that of $f(x) = x$. I cannot figure out at all how to turn this intuition/geometric argument into a rigorous analytical one.  Any help is appreciated.  Thanks.",,['calculus']
