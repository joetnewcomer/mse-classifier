The point is: I'm self learning differential geometry, however, I didn't find the answer for this in the book nor on the web. I've once asked about how to find charts, but now my point is another: is how to represent the elements of a manifold before start creating the charts. First, I'm using Do Carmo's definition of manifold: A smooth manifold of dimension $n$ is a set $M$ with a family of bijective maps $\varphi_\alpha : U_\alpha \to M$ from open sets $U_\alpha\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ to $M$ such that: $\bigcup_\alpha\varphi_\alpha(U_\alpha)=M$ For each pair $\alpha, \beta$ with $\varphi_\alpha(U_\alpha)\cap\varphi_\beta(U_\beta)=W\neq\emptyset$ we have $\varphi_\alpha^{-1}(W)$, $\varphi_\beta^{-1}(W)$ open in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\varphi_\beta^{-1}\circ\varphi_\alpha$, $\varphi_\alpha^{-1}\circ\varphi_\beta$ are differentiable. The family $\left\{U_\alpha, \varphi_\alpha\right\}$ is maximum with respect to conditions 1 and 2. Amongst all definitions of smooth manifold, this one was the one I prefered to work with. My point here is: we make this definition in order to avoid the need to consider manifolds as subsets of some euclidean space. In other words, we want to deal with them without making reference to some ambient space. My problem with this is to find the charts. I have to construct bijective functions from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $M$, and so my doubt is: how I describe the elements of $M$? The classical example of finding charts for the sphere $S^n$ assumes that the sphere is defined as a subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, so we know that if $p \in S^n$ then there are $n$ real numbers $p^i$ such that $p = \left(p^1 ,\cdots, p^n\right)$ that simply satisfy some conditions. Then it becomes easier to find the charts because first of all we know how to describe the elements of the set. Second, because we can use the ambient space, so we can use stereographic projections, which depends on the ambient space. But in general, we don't want to use one ambient space. So, if I was asked for instance to find the charts for the sphere without the ambient space, what should I do? Well, now if $p \in S^n$, I cannot say that $p$ is one $n$-tuple of numbers, and I cannot also use things from outside $S^n$ like the planes and lines used in stereographic projections. I'm confused with all of that. In understand the theorems, the proofs, the use of transition charts to ensure differentiability, and so on. My only problem is to find the charts, I feel I'm in need of examples, but I haven't found many. Do Carmo's examples deal just with surfaces, and he always presents them as subsets of $\mathbb{R}^3$. Can someone explain those points or point me some references? Sorry for such a silly and basic question.

For instance, in some books of literature(cf Do Carmo, Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces ), the Gauss Map is defined on manifold, i.e, let $M \subset R^3$ , the Gauss map is defined by $$ N: M \to S^2 $$ In other books, for exemple in Kühnel, Differential Geometry , the Gauss Map is defined on domain of parametrization: Let $f: U \to R^3$ a surface element (a parametrization), the Gauss $$ \nu: U \to S^2 $$ is defined by the formula $$ \nu(u,v) = \frac{f_u \times f_v}{|f_u \times f_v |} $$ I observe that, the definition of Do Carmo, is more geometric than the definition of Kühnel, the formula for Gauss map in Coordinates in Do Carmo, depends of points on Surface, $$ N(p) = \frac{f_u \times f_v}{|f_u \times f_v |}(p) $$ Discussion Considering that, $f: U \to R^3$ , is a parameterization, that is, if $M$ is a manifold in $R^3$ , $f$ is a homeomorphism of $U$ on $M$ , whose derivative of $f$ is injective, then, study in $M$ , wouldn't that be the same as studying in $U$ (topologycally speaking)?

Another thing I realized is about the definition of a tangent plane to a manifold. For example, the tangent plane is defined to be a vector space that contains all vectors tangent to a surface. But, let's analyze the concept of ""tangent vector"". In some books, the tangent vector to a manifold is defined to be a tangent vector to a curve $a: I \to U$ , such that $a'(t)$ is a vector whose property is to be tangent to a at $t$ when it is translated by $a(t)$ , that is, the vector $v = a'(t) +a(t)$ is tangent(geometrically speaking) to the curve $a$ at $t$ . In this way, if $f$ is the parameterization of the surface, the derivative of the curve $f(a(t))$ is tangent to the surface in the same sense that I just explained in the case of the curve $a$ . Where am I going with this? Well, my question is the following: if $a'$ and $b'$ are tangent vectors to the curves $a: I \to U$ and $b: J \to U$ , such that $\{a', b'\}$ span the tangent space $T_pU$ , ​​where $p$ is a point of $U$ , we know that $Df$ is an isomorphism of vector spaces, so $Df(TpU)$ is the tangent space to $M$ , that is, it is isomorphic to $T_{f(p)}M$ . Thus, it seems to me that nothing is lost, from an algebraic point of view, working on the variety (in the co-domain) than working on the domain. The conclusion I reached: It seems to me, that there are no topological, or algebraic differences, working in the codomain or in the domain.

No seriously mathematically rigorous notion can depend on the particular way in which we choose to communicate, and so even though you could rip apart the Einstein summation convention, asking all sorts of fringe case questions of the type ""does Einstein summation notation apply in this case"" it is generally understood enough that it is just accepted as a way to communicate, no more or less treacherous than the fact that we write symbols on paper.

I don't understand what people are trying to communicate, but I can reconstruct enough of it that you can hopefully help me: Sometimes writing upper indices indicates something of a ""dual"" nature.  For instance, Einstein summation is often used when we contract a dual vector applied to a vector. Sometimes writing something upper indicates inversion.

Is there any system to what the location of an index means?  Or is it just special case by special case?  For instance, is 2. an instance of a more general rule, or is it that inversion is only meant in the case of $g_{ij}$.  2. and 1. seem to be in conflict?  Or maybe neither 1. nor 2. hold, there is no meaning, and it just happens that for both the case of inversion and transpose, it is convenient to simply write upper indices so that Einstein summation is in effect? b.

The claim is that for two arbitrary connetions $\nabla_1$ and $\nabla_2$ on E, their difference $A=\nabla_1-\nabla_2$ is in $\Omega^1(End(E))$, so the space of connections is an affine space for the vector space $\Omega^1(End(E))$.

For the case $m=1,n=0$, again, the solution is obvious and requires $k=3$: you just have to make the two centres coincide and make the diameter of the $0$-sphere to be orthogonal to all diameters of the $1$-sphere. Again, $k=m+n+2$, which suggests a conjecture that it holds for all $m,n$. But how to solve this for arbitrary $m$ and $n$?",,"['differential-geometry', 'differential-topology']"
78,Covariant derivative ambiguity,Covariant derivative ambiguity,,"I'm studying general relativity and am running into an ambiguity with the covariant derivative. The covariant derivative acting on a scalar is, in a co-ordinate basis, simply $$\nabla_X f = X^a \nabla_a f = X^a \partial_a f $$ whilst when acting on vectors or tensors, the covariant derivative includes extra terms involving the connection coefficients $\Gamma$. My problem is that I'm not sure what happens when the covariant derivative acts on the components of a vector. So the $X^a$ in the above expression are each scalar functions, and so when we write $\nabla_Y X^a$, do we assume the covariant derivative acts on $X^a$ as scalars, or do we include connection coefficient terms?

Could someone give a short working-man's introduction to half-forms? How does one work with them? How are they related to one-forms? What pitfalls should one look out for? Thanks for any suggestion. EDIT I was asked in the comments to point to a source where the notion of half-forms is being used. Most recently I found them in this paper . See eq. (4.21) and the paragraph below it. The authors use these objects without making a fuss about it, which indicates that this should be standard knowledge.","Apparently, objects called half-forms exist in differential geometry.

95,defining smooth functions on smooth manifolds,defining smooth functions on smooth manifolds,,"The standard approach to defining smooth functions $f:M\to\mathbb{R}$ on a topological manifold $M$ equipped with a smooth structure (i.e., a maximal smooth atlas) $\mathcal{A}$ is the following. Say a function $f$ is smooth at $p\in M$ if there exists a coordinate chart $(U,\phi)\in\mathcal{A}$ such that $p\in U$ and $$f\circ\phi^{-1}:\phi(U)\to\mathbb{R}$$ is smooth. (Say $M$ is $n$-dimensional, so that $U$ is homeomorphic to $\phi(U)\subset\mathbb{R}^n$.) It is then supposed to be a simple exercise that the smoothness of $f$ at $p$ doesn't depend on the choice of chart $(U,\phi)$, in the sense that $f$ will be smooth in all charts $(V,\theta)\in\mathcal{A}$ such that $p\in V$. (Lang, for example, says ""One sees then immediately..."" See the photo at the end of this post.) I take this to mean that if $f\circ\phi^{-1}$ is smooth for some $(U,\phi)$, then for any $V$ such that $p\in V$, we have $$\boxed{f\circ\theta^{-1}:\theta(V)\to\mathbb{R}}$$ is smooth. Here is where I'm confused. I know how the proof is supposed to go: you use the fact that chart transformations must be smooth (by the definition of the smooth atlas), writing $$f\circ\theta^{-1}=(\underbrace{f\circ\phi^{-1}}_{:=\alpha})\circ(\underbrace{\phi\circ\theta^{-1}}_{:=\beta})$$ By assumption, $\alpha$ is smooth, and $\beta$ is smooth because it is a chart transformation. Indeed the point of requiring smooth chart transitions is precisely to make this argument go through. But the problem I'm having is with domains. The function $f\circ\theta^{-1}$ is defined on all of $\theta(V)\subset\mathbb{R}^n$, whereas the chart transformation $\beta$ is defined only on the smaller domain $\theta(U\cap V)\subset\theta(V)$. So I don't see how $f\circ\theta^{-1}$ can be defined on all of $\theta(V)$, and that seems to be what I need to check (per the box above). So my question is: how exactly is this argument supposed to go? Do I need define $f\circ\theta^{-1}$ piecewise as $\alpha\circ\beta$ on $\theta(U\cap V)$ together with some other definition on $\theta(V)-\theta(U\cap V)$? I think I'm missing something very simple, but I can't see it. This issue has bothered me for years.
