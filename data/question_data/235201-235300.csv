1,Are there results for relations between upward and downward closed partitions of some powerset?,Are there results for relations between upward and downward closed partitions of some powerset?,,"I stumbled upon this, given some set $X$ and its powerset $\mathcal{P}(X)$ and some incomparable set $\mathbb{S}\subseteq\mathcal{P}(X)$, i.e. for any $S,S'\in\mathbb{S}$ we have $S\setminus S'\neq\emptyset$. Then upward closure of $S$ is defined as $up(\mathbb{S})=\{S'\supseteq S\mid S\in\mathbb{S}\}$. Given an upward closed set its minimal elements define an incomparable set. Similarly for incomparable $\mathbb{T}\subseteq\mathcal{P}(X)$ we can define a downward closure $do(\mathbb{T})=\{T'\subseteq T\mid T\in\mathbb{T}\}$.

Now the interesting part starts: Each upward closed set $up(\mathbb{S})$ uniquely defines a downward closed set $do(\mathbb{S})=\mathcal{P}(X)\setminus up(\mathbb{S})$ and vice versa.

Problem: If A $\subset$ X, then A $\cup$ $A^c$= X My solution: Let A $\subset$ X and let n$\in$ A $\cup$ $A^c$. Then n $\in$ A or n $\in$ $A^c$. If n $\in$ A, then because A $\subset$ X we have that n $\in$ X. If  n$\in$ $A^c$, Then by definition n $\in$ X. Thus $A \cup A^c \subset X.$ Now let n $\in$ X. Then there are only two possibilities. Either n $\in$ A or n $\in$ $A^c$. Thus n $\in$ $ A \cup A^c$ So X $\subset$ A $\cup$ $A^c$",,"['elementary-set-theory', 'proof-verification']"

Is there any way out of this to finish the counter? Note: If you can think of a better title for the question, please let me know.","Denote $\bar{A}$ a complement of $A$ in a set $\Omega$ and $A \Delta B = A/B \cup B/A$ the symmetric difference of $A, B$. It is claimed that for a map $\phi := \Omega \rightarrow \lbrace 0, 1 \rbrace, \; \phi(\emptyset) = 0$: $$ \begin{array}{|c|c|} \hline \phi(A) & \phi(\bar{A}) \\ \hline 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \\ \hline \end{array}, \, A \in \Omega  \implies \phi(A \Delta B) = \phi(A) + \phi(B),  \text{  and } \phi(\Omega) = 1 $$ I know of a counterexample to this. Let $\mathcal{P}(\alpha)$ be a set of all subsets (a power set) of set $\alpha$. Consider $\phi: \Omega \rightarrow \lbrace 0,1 \rbrace$, $\Omega = \mathcal{P}({\lbrace a, b, c \rbrace})$: $$ \begin{align*} \phi(a) &= 0 & \phi(b) &= 1 & \phi(c) &= 1 &  \phi(\emptyset) &= 0 \\ \phi(b \cup c ) &= 1 & \phi(a \cup c) &= 0 & \phi(a \cup b) &= 0 & \phi(a \cup b \cup c) &= 1 \end{align*} $$ which satisfies the truth table, but breaks linearity ($\phi(a \Delta c) = \phi(a \cup b) = 0 \neq \phi(a) + \phi(c) = 1$). I am interested if the following could be also implied by the LHS and also lead to a valid counter: $$ \phi(A \Delta B) = \phi(A) + \phi(B) + \phi(A)\phi(B), \, \text{ and } \phi(\Omega)  =1 $$ Choosing $\phi(A) = 0$ implies that: $$ \phi(A \Delta \bar{A}) = \phi(\Omega) = 1 = \phi(A) + \phi(\bar{A})(1 + \phi(A)) = \phi(\bar{A})$$ and hence: $\phi(A) = 0 \implies\phi(\bar{A}) = 1$ and $\phi(\bar{A}) = 0 \implies \phi(A) = 1$. Choosing $\phi(A) = 1$ however leads to: $$ 1 = 1 + \phi(\bar{A})\cdot 0 = 1 $$ no matter what $\phi(\bar{A})$ is, so the opposite implication is not simply shown to hold.

So, it concludes that $a = \gamma(m,n)$ and thus it proves that $\gamma$ is a surjection. The fact is, why would proving $a = \gamma(m,n)$ make the function surjective? From the definition of a surjective function, if $f$: A -> B is surjective, then $\forall y \in B, \exists x\in A$ such that $f(x) = y$. In this case, how can we prove that for all $a \in A$ this will hold true? For this case, it seems that it is only for a particular $a$.",,"['functions', 'elementary-set-theory']"
