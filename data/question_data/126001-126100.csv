Attempted Proof: Let $G$ be a simple group of order $3393$ . Sylow theory tells us that the number of Sylow $29$ subgroups of $G$ , $n_{29}$ is either $1$ or $117$ and that the number of Sylow $13$ subgroups of $G$ , $n_{13}$ is either $1$ or 260 $261$ .

Let $\operatorname{Syl}_{29}(G) = \{H_i \ | 1 \leq i \leq 117\}$ , since $H_i \cap H_j \leq H_i$ for any $i \neq j$ we must have $H_i \cap H_j = \{1_G\}$ , for otherwise we'd end up with $H_i \cap H_j$ . This shows that we have at least $117 \times 28 = 3276$ elements of order $29$ in $G$ .

11,Classifying automorphisms using a group presentation.,Classifying automorphisms using a group presentation.,,"I'm new to group presentations and after some playing around with the concept, I've tried to find some relatively clear criteria in terms of the defining relations, that would tell us if a map is an automorphism. I would appreciate any input - whether my approach is correct, and whether there's some other more general or neater way. Let $X=\{x_1,\dots ,x_n \}$ be a finite set and let $R$ be some finite set of relations on the alphabet of $X \cup X^{-1}$ . Denote $G$ the group corresponding to these defining relations - $G= \langle X \mid R \rangle =F_X / N$ , and presume $G$ is finite. I think the following might be true: Consider a map $f:X \rightarrow G$ . If $\langle f(x_1),\dots ,f(x_n) \rangle = G$ and $f(x_i)$ satisfy the corresponding relations when stated in terms of $x_i$ , then $f$ induces an automorphism. Proof: If we show that $f$ induces homomorphism $\overline{f}$ , it's surjective and hence an automorphism, so we only need to show that $f$ actually induces a homomorphism. Consider the free group $F$ on $X$ , and define $g:F \rightarrow G$ by $w \mapsto f(w_1)f(w_2)\dots f(w_m)$ . We know that $f(x_i)$ satisfy the wanted relations, and so the $N \subseteq \ker (g)$ . By the homomorphism theorem there exists a $\psi$ , such that $\psi \circ \pi_N = g$ . This $\psi$ is the wanted extension of $f$ . In some sense this seems excessive - we're dealing with finite groups. An idea of how to deal with this in finite groups: Presume that any element in $G$ can be expressed as a word in $X$ of length at most $k$ . Define a map $g$ from words of length $2k$ to $G$ induced by $f$ . If we check that for any two words of length $2k$ that represent the same element in $G$ , that their image is the same, we will be done.

I think the following might be true: Consider a map . If and satisfy the corresponding relations when stated in terms of , then induces an automorphism. Proof: If we show that induces homomorphism , it's surjective and hence an automorphism, so we only need to show that actually induces a homomorphism. Consider the free group on , and define by . We know that satisfy the wanted relations, and so the . By the homomorphism theorem there exists a , such that . This is the wanted extension of . In some sense this seems excessive - we're dealing with finite groups. An idea of how to deal with this in finite groups: Presume that any element in can be expressed as a word in of length at most . Define a map from words of length to induced by . If we check that for any two words of length that represent the same element in , that their image is the same, we will be done. I know that none of this is very formal, but I would mostly like to know whether my approach is sensible. I would also appreciate if someone linked some text that deals with this in a more formal way.","X=\{x_1,\dots ,x_n \} R X \cup X^{-1} G G= \langle X \mid R \rangle =F_X / N G f:X \rightarrow G \langle f(x_1),\dots ,f(x_n) \rangle = G f(x_i) x_i f f \overline{f} f F X g:F \rightarrow G w \mapsto f(w_1)f(w_2)\dots f(w_m) f(x_i) N \subseteq \ker (g) \psi \psi \circ \pi_N = g \psi f G X k g 2k G f 2k G","['group-theory', 'solution-verification', 'finite-groups', 'group-isomorphism', 'group-presentation']"
12,On convex hulls of polyhedra and transitivity,On convex hulls of polyhedra and transitivity,,"It's easy to prove that the convex hull of any vertex-transitive polyhedron is vertex-transitive.

I have a solution, but I am suspicious that there is something wrong with it, because I do not fully use one of the hypotheses. Let $G$ be a finite group in which every maximal subgroup has prime index, and let $p$ be the largest prime divisor of $|G|$. Show that a Sylow $p$-subgroup is normal. Hint: Otherwise, let $M$ be a maximal subgroup of $G$ containing $N_G(P)$, where $P \in Syl_p(G)$. Compare $n_P(M)$ and $n_P(G)$. I argue as suggested in the hint. Suppose that $P \in Syl_p(G)$ and $P$ is not normal. Then $N_G(P)$ is a proper subgroup of $G$, so it is contained in some maximal subgroup $M$. This gives us the containments $P \leq N_G(P) \leq M < G$. Note also that $P \in Syl_p(M)$. Since $|G:M|$ is prime and is not equal to $p$ (otherwise $|G:P|$ would be divisible by $p$), we have $|G:M| = q < p$ for some prime $q$. Now $n_p(G) = |G:N_G(P)|$ and $n_p(M) = |M:N_M(P)|$. But $N_M(P) = N_G(P) \cap M = N_G(P)$ since $N_G(P) \leq M$. Therefore, $n_p(M) = |M:N_G(P)|$. Summarizing, we have $n_p(G) = |G:N_G(P)| = |G:M|\,|M:N_G(P)| = q\,n_p(M)$. Taking this equation mod $p$ gives us $1 \equiv q$ mod $p$, since by Sylow's theorem both $n_p(G)$ and $n_p(M)$ are congruent to $1$ mod $p$. But $1 < q < p$, so we have a contradiction, and therefore $P$ must be normal after all. My concern is that I don't seem to require that $q$ is prime, only that it is any integer satisfying $1 < q < p$. So, it would seem that the hypothesis ""every maximal subgroup has prime index"" could be replaced with ""every maximal subgroup has index no larger than $p$"".

31,When is the Cayley embedding for infinite groups optimal?,When is the Cayley embedding for infinite groups optimal?,,"By Cayley's theorem, any group $G$ naturally injects into the symmetric group $\mathrm{Sym}(G)$ of its underlying set via the Cayley embedding. Let's say this embedding is optimal for $G$ , if there is no embeding $G \hookrightarrow \mathrm{Sym}(I)$ for some smaller index set $I$ . The finite groups with this property are completely understood , they are just the primary cyclic groups, the generalized quaternion groups, or $C_2\times C_2$ . For infinite groups, this phenomenon is a lot more common: In fact, if $|G|$ is a strong limit cardinal (that is, if $\lambda<|G|$ implies $2^\lambda<|G|$ ), it can have no smaller faithful permutation representation (as $|\mathrm{Sym}(\lambda)|=2^\lambda$ for any infinite $\lambda$ ). But if $|G|$ is not a strong limit, I do not know what happens in general. Are there any groups of these sizes with no smaller embeddings? Is there even a characterization of them? Some thoughts: With a bit of work, I was able to show that any infinite abelian group $A$ with $|A|$ not a strong limit always has a more efficient embedding. I will reproduce the proof in case it could lead to any insights into the general case: Suppose $A$ is such a group. Fix some $\lambda<|A|$ for which we have $|A|\leq 2^\lambda$ . We will show that $A$ then embeds into $\mathrm{Sym}(\lambda)$ . To that end, we will show that there is an embedding $\iota: A \hookrightarrow \left(\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{Q}\right)^\lambda$ . This will suffice: The subgroups $$A_\alpha= \ker(\pi_\alpha\circ \iota) $$ (where $\pi_\alpha$ is the projection onto the $\alpha$ -th coordinate) are each of (at most) countable index in $A$ and altogether intersect trivially (both clear by definition). Hence, the action of $A$ on the disjoint union $\coprod_{\alpha<\lambda}A/A_\alpha$ is faithful on a set of cardinality $\lambda\times \omega=\lambda$ . It thus remains to construct this embedding $\iota$ . First, we deal with the $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$ -part: Fix any prime $p$ and consider the $\mathbb{F}_p$ -vector space $V_p$ of the $p$ -torsion elements. Since $|V_p|\leq |A|\leq 2^\lambda$ , we have an embedding $V_p \hookrightarrow \mathbb{F}_p^\lambda$ which further embeds into $\left(\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}\right)^\lambda$ (just coordinatewise). Since this latter group is injective, this embedding extends to a homomorphism $\iota_p:A\to \left(\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}\right)^\lambda$ which is then injective on the $p$ -component of $A$ . If we put all these homomorphisms for each prime $p$ together, we obtain a map $$\iota_T:A\to \left(\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}\right)^{\lambda\times \omega}\simeq \left( \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z} \right)^{\lambda}$$ that is injective on the torsion subgroup $T$ of $A$ . Finally, the torsion free quotient $A/T$ likewise embeds into $\mathbb{Q}^\lambda$ , which we can then amalgamate with $\iota_T$ into a map into $\left(\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{Q} \right)^\lambda$ which is then finally guaranteed to be injective.","By Cayley's theorem, any group naturally injects into the symmetric group of its underlying set via the Cayley embedding.

42,Finite groups whose Sylow 2-subroups are Klein groups,Finite groups whose Sylow 2-subroups are Klein groups,,"I am reading part VIII of Burnside's ""Notes on the Theory of Groups of Finite Order"". It was published in 1895 (Proc. London Math. Soc., vol. 26, p. 325-338, 1895, Collected Papers, vol. I, p. 590-596). Burnside first proves something that I understand (in today's language) as follows : $\mathbf{Statement \ 1}.$ Let $G$ be a finite group whose Sylow 2-subgroups are Klein groups. Then one (and only one) of the two following cases holds : (i) for every Sylow 2-subgroup $V$ of $G$ , the three elements of order 2 of $V$ form a conjugacy class in $N_{G}(V)$ , $\vert N_{G}(V) \vert = 3 \vert C_{G}(V) \vert$ (and thus $\vert G \vert$ is divisible by 12) and all elements of order 2 in $G$ are conjugate in $G$ ; (ii) for every Sylow 2-subgroup $V$ of $G$ , the three elements of order 2 of $V$ are pairwise non-conjugate in $G$ and $N_{G}(V) = C_{G}(V)$ . I have no problem with that. Thereafter, Burnside's goal seems to be to prove that if $G$ is simple, it is the case (i) of Statement 1 that takes place. Today, it is an easy consequence of Burnside's transfer theorem : in case (ii), we have $N_{G}(V) = C_{G}(V)$ for every Sylow 2-subgroup $V$ of $G$ , thus, by Burnside's transfer theorem, $G$ cannot be simple. But Burnside doesn't use his transfer theorem here. (I presume that he had not yet stated this theorem in 1895. By the way, when and where did he publish it for the first time ? I don't find the answer on Internet.) I must confess that I don't understand this part of Burnside's paper. He considers a group, let us say $G$ , of order $N = 4m$ , with $m$ odd, he assumes that the Sylow 2-subgroups of $G$ are Klein groups and, if I understand it correctly, he notes $4m_{1}$ the order of the normalizer in $G$ of a Sylow 2-subgroup of $G$ . Then he says (p. 590-591 in the Collected Papers, vol. I) : ""Suppose now that this is not the case [I understand : Suppose that we are not in case (i) of Statement 1, in other words suppose that we are in case (ii) of Statement 1.], so that the group contains 3 different conjugate sets of operations of order 2 [OK]. Every operation [Burnside says ""operation"" where we say ""element""] of order 2 is certainly self-conjugate [For an element of a group, Burnside says ""self-conjugate"" where we say ""central""; for a subgroup, he says ""self-conjugate"" where we say ""normal"".] in a sub-group of order $2^{2}m_{1}$ [Indeed, every element $v$ of order 2 of $G$ is contained in a Sylow 2-subgroup $V$ of $G$ and, since we are in case (ii) of Statement 1, $N_{G}(V)$ centralizes $V$ and thus centralizes $v$ . Recall that $2^{2}m_{1}$ is the order of $N_{G}(V)$ for every Sylow 2-subgroup $V$ of $G$ .], and may be self-conjugate in a more extensive sub-group. [In other words : $N_{G}(V)$ is contained in $C_{G}(v)$ and it is possible that $C_{G}(v)$ is greater than $N_{G}(V)$ .] Let, then, $S$ , an operation of order 2 be self-conjugate within a group of order $2^{2}m_{1} \mu $ . [I understand : let $S$ be an element of order 2 of $G$ and let $2^{2}m_{1} \mu $ be the order of $C_{G}(S)$ .] An operation of this sub-group whose order is odd, and which is not contained in the sub-group of order $2^{2}m_{1}$ , is permutable with $S$ , and with no operation of order 2 which is not conjugate to $S$ ."" What is exactly the meaning of this last sentence ? Burnside says ""THE sub-group of order $2^{2}m_{1}$ "". But $S$ can belong to several Sylow 2-subgroups of $G$ . If $S$ is in a Sylow 2-subgroup $V$ of $G$ and also in another Sylow 2-subgroup $W$ of $G$ , what is ""THE sub-group of order $2^{2}m_{1}$ "" ? $N_{G}(V)$ or $N_{G}(W)$ ? In any case, I think that the following statement is wrong : $\mathbf{Statement \ 2}.$ (not from Burnside, and wrong). Let $G$ be a finite group whose Sylow 2-subgroups are Klein groups. Assume that case (ii) of Statement 1 holds, so that, for every Sylow 2-subgroup $V$ of $G$ , the three elements of order 2 of $V$ are pairwise non-conjugate in $G$ and $N_{G}(V) = C_{G}(V)$ . Let $v$ be an element of order 2 of $G$ , let $V$ be a Sylow 2-subgroup of $G$ containing $v$ , let $t$ be an element of odd order in $C_{G}(v)$ and assume that $t$ is not in $N_{G}(V) = C_{G}(V)$ . Then all elements of order 2 in $C_{G}(t)$ are conjugate in $G$ . Here is a counterexample. Let $H$ be a nonabelian group of order 21. Then $H$ is a semidirect product $\langle x_{7} \rangle \rtimes  \langle y_{3} \rangle $ , where $x_{7}$ is an element of order 7, $y_{3}$ an element of order 3 and $y_{3} x_{7} {y_{3}}^{-1} = {x_{7}}^{2}$ . By von Dyck's theorem, or whatever, there exists one and only one automorphism $\sigma$ of H such that $\sigma (x_{7}) = {x_{7}}^{-1}$ and $\sigma (y_{3}) = y_{3}$ . Clearly, $\sigma$ is of order 2 in $Aut(H)$ . Choose a Klein group $V = \{1, a, b, c\}$ . Let $\tau : v \mapsto \tau_{v}$ be the homomorphism from $V$ to $Aut(H)$ such that $\tau_{1} = \tau_{a} = id_{H}, \tau_{b} = \tau_{c} =\sigma$ . Put $G = H \rtimes _{\tau}V$ . Clearly the Sylow 2-subgroups of $G = H \rtimes _{\tau}V$ are Klein groups. It is easy to check that (1) $\qquad (1, a)$ is a central element of order 2 in $G = H \rtimes _{\tau}V$ ; (2) $\qquad (1, b)$ is an element of order 2 in $G = H \rtimes _{\tau}V$ and it commutes with $(y_{3}, 1)$ , which is an element of order 3 in $G = H \rtimes _{\tau}V$ ; (3) $\qquad (x_{7}, b)$ is an element of order 2 in $G = H \rtimes _{\tau}V$ and it doesn't commute with $(y_{3}, 1)$ . From (1), it results that $(1, a)$ is conjugate to no element of $G = H \rtimes _{\tau}V$ other than $(1, a)$ itself. Since (for example by (2) ), $G = H \rtimes _{\tau}V$ has at least one other element of order 2 than $(1, a)$ , it is not true that all the elements of order 2 in $G = H \rtimes _{\tau}V$ are conjugate in $G = H \rtimes _{\tau}V$ . Thus we are not in case (i) of Statement 1, thus (4) $\qquad$ it is case (ii) of Statement 1 which holds, Put $W = \langle (1, a), (x_{7}, b)\rangle$ . In view of (1) and (3), $W$ is a Sylow 2-subgroup $W$ of $G = H \rtimes _{\tau}V$ , $(y_{3}, 1)$ commutes with $(1, a)$ , $(y_{3}, 1)$ is not in $C_{G}(W)$ . Thus, if Statement 2 was true, all the elements of order 2 of $G = H \rtimes _{\tau}V$ commuting with $(y_{3}, 1)$ should be conjugate to eachother in $G$ . It is false, since, by (1) and (2), both $(1, a)$ and $(1, b)$ are elements of order 2 commuting with $(y_{3}, 1)$ , but they are not conjugate in $G$ (since $(1, a)$ is central in $G$ ). Thus Statement 2 is wrong. So my question is : do you think that Burnside's proof is correct and, if it is the case, could you make it clearer ? I will now copy the whole proof of Burnside. Maybe it can help you understand his ideas. ""Suppose now that this is not the case, so that the group contains 3 different conjugate sets of operations of order 2. Every operation of order 2 is certainly self-conjugate in a sub-group of order $2^{2}m_{1}$ , and may be self-conjugate in a more extensive sub-group. Let, then, $S$ , an operation of order 2 be self-conjugate within a group of order $2^{2}m_{1} \mu $ . An operation of this sub-group whose order is odd, and which is not contained in the sub-group of order $2^{2}m_{1}$ , is permutable with $S$ , and with no operation of order 2 which is not conjugate to $S$ . Hence it must form one of a set of $2r$ conjugate operations , where $r$ is odd. If now the group be represented as a permutation group, consisting of the permutations of these $2r$ operations among themselves which arise by transforming them by all the operations of the group, any operation of order 2 which is not conjugate to $S$ will give a substitution in the permutation-group, consisting in $r$ transpositions, i.e. an odd substitution, and, therefore, the group cannot be simple. Hence, the group is certainly not simple unless the maximum sub-group, which contains an operation of order 2 self-conjugately, is of order $2^{2}m_{1}$ ; and when this condition is satisfied every operation of order 2 is permutable with just 2 other operations of order 2, and with no more. But, now, if $A$ , $B$ are two operations of order 2 belonging to different conjugate sets, and if $(AB)^{n} = 1$ , $A$ , $B$ generate a dihedral group of order $2n$ . If $n$ were odd, $A$ and $B$ would be conjugate, which is not the case. Hence, $n$ must be even, and then $(AB)^{\frac{1}{2}n}$ is an operation of order 2 which is permutable with $n$ distinct pairs [?] of operations of order 2. But this is in direct contradiction to what has just been proved, so that this case cannot occur. It follows that, if a group whose order is $2^{2}m$ ( $m$ odd) contains 3 different conjugate sets of operations of order 2, it cannot be simple."" $\mathbf{Edit}$ (May 22, 2021). I still feel that Burnside's proof is not absolutely correct, but I think it can be fixed (without use of transfer theory), by use of Burnside's ideas. Let $G$ be a finite simple group whose Sylow 2-subgroups are Klein groups and let us prove that all the elements of order 2 in $G$ are conjugate. $\mathbf{Lemma \ 1.}$ Let $G$ a finite simple group, let $t$ be an element of $G$ such that the number of conjugates of $t$ in $G$ is of the form $2r$ , with $r$ odd. Then, for every element $s$ of order 2 in $G$ , there exists at least one G-conjugate of $t$ which commutes with $s$ . Proof. Let $Conj(t)$ denote the set of conjugates of $t$ in $G$ . From the hypotheses, $Conj(t)$ has more than an element, thus the simple group $G$ is nonabelian and acts nontrivially on $Conj(t)$ by conjugation, thus the permutation $u \mapsto sus^{-1}$ is even. If $s$ commuted with no conjugate of $t$ , this permutation should be the product of $r$ transpositions (with disjoint supports) and should thus be odd, contradiction. $\mathbf{Lemma \ 2.}$ Let $G$ be a group, let $a, b$ two elements of order 2 in $G$ , not conjugate with each other in $G$ . Assume that $ab$ has finite order $n$ . Then $\langle a, b \rangle$ is a dihedral group of order $2n$ and $n$ is even. Proof. The fact that $\langle a, b \rangle$ is a dihedral group of order $2n$ is classical (Rotman 1999, theor. 3.32, p. 68). Assume (absurdly) that $n$ is odd. Then the order of $\langle a, b \rangle$ is even and not divisible by 4, thus the Sylow 2-subgroups of $\langle a, b \rangle$ are its subgroups of order 2, thus (Sylow) all the subgroups of order 2 of $\langle a, b \rangle$ are conjugate in $\langle a, b \rangle$ , thus all the elements of order 2 of $\langle a, b \rangle$ are conjugate in $\langle a, b \rangle$ , thus $a$ and $b$ are conjugate in $\langle a, b \rangle$ and thus in $G$ , contradiction. Here is another proof that $n$ is even. If $n$ was odd, say $n = 2k + 1$ , we would have $(ab)^{2k+1} = 1$ , $(ab)^{k} a (ab)^{-k} = b$ thus $a$ and $b$ would be conjugate, contradiction. $\mathbf{Theorem.}$ Let $G$ a finite simple group whose Sylow 2-subgroups are Klein groups. Then all the elements of order 2 of $G$ are conjugate. Proof. Assume first that (hyp. 1) $\qquad $ there exists an element $t$ of $G$ such that the number of conjugates of $t$ is of the form $2r$ , with $r$ odd. Then, by Lemma 1, every element of order 2 of $G$ commutes with (at least) one conjugate of $t$ . In other words, (2) $\qquad$ every element of order 2 of $G$ is conjugate in $G$ with an element (of order 2) of $C_{G}(t)$ . On the other hand, since the order of $G$ is divisible by 4 and not by 8, it results from (1) that $\vert C_{G}(t) \vert$ is divisible by 2 and not by 4. Thus the Sylow 2-subgroups of $C_{G}(t)$ are its subgroups of order 2, thus (Sylow) the subgroups of order 2 of $C_{G}(t)$ are conjugate in $C_{G}(t)$ , which amounts to say that the elements of order 2 of $C_{G}(t)$ are conjugate in $C_{G}(t)$ . With (2), this proves that all the elements of order 2 of $G$ are conjugate in $G$ . Thus the theorem is true in our hypothesis (1), thus we can assume that this hypothesis is not satisfied, i.e. (3) $\qquad$ for every element $t$ of $G$ , the number of conjugates of $t$ in $G$ is odd or divisible by 4. Assume that (absurdly), (hyp.4) $\qquad$ there exist two elements $a$ and $b$ of order 2 of $G$ which are not conjugate in $G$ . Let $n$ denote the order of $ab$ . By Lemma 2, $n$ is even and $\langle a, b \rangle$ is a dihedral group of order $2n$ (and thus of order divisible by 4). Assume that (absurdly) (hyp. 5) $\qquad n$ is not equal to 2. Then, since $n$ is even and $G$ has no element of order 4, $n$ is not a power of 2, thus the dihedral group $\langle a, b \rangle$ has at least one element $t$ of odd prime order $p$ , In a dihedral group, every element of odd order is conjugate to its inverse, thus $t$ and $t^{-1}$ are conjugate in $\langle a, b \rangle$ . A fortiori, (6) $\qquad t$ and $t^{-1}$ are conjugate in $G$ . Let $t'$ be a conjugate of $t$ in $G$ . Then $t'$ is of order $p$ . Since $p$ is odd and $\neq 1$ , $t'$ and $t'^{-1}$ are distinct. Moreover, in view of (6), $t'$ and $t'^{-1}$ are conjugate in $G$ . Thus the conjugates of $t$ in $G$ are in even number, thus, in view of (3), the number of conjugates of $t$ in $G$ is divisible by 4. Since the order of $G$ is divisible by 4 and not by 8, this implies that (7) $\qquad \vert C_{G}(t) \vert$ is odd. But $t$ , being of order different from 2, is in the unique cyclic subgroup $C$ of index 2 of the dihedral group $\langle a, b \rangle$ . Since $C$ is abelian, $C$ centralizes $t$ , thus $C_{G}(t)$ contains $C$ . But the order of $C$ is $n$ and is thus even, thus $C_{G}(t) \vert$ is even, which contradicts (7). Thus our hypothesis (5) is false, thus (always in our hypothesis 4), $n = 2$ , in other words the order of $ab$ is 2, which implies that $a$ and $b$ commute. Thus we have proved that (8) $\qquad$ for all elements $a, b$ of order 2 of $G$ which are not conjugate in $G$ , $a$ and $b$ commute. If $a$ and $b$ are two such elements, then, every conjugate $b'$ of $b$ in $G$ is an element of order 2 which is not conjugate to $a$ , thus the hypotheses on $a$ and $b$ in (8) are satisfied by $a$ and $b'$ , thus every conjugate of $b$ commutes with $a$ , thus (9) $\qquad$ the subgroup of $G$ generated by the conjugates of $b$ is contained in $C_{G}(a)$ . But the subgroup of $G$ generated by the conjugates of $b$ is a nontrivial normal subgroup of $G$ , thus, since $G$ is assumed to be simple, the subgroup of $G$ generated by the conjugates of $b$ is the whole $G$ , thus (9) means that $C_{G}(a) = G$ , thus $a$ is central in $G$ , which is impossible, since $G$ is a nonabelian simple group. Thus our hypothesis (4) is absurd, which proves the theorem. We can conclude from this theorem that (if $G$ is a simple group whose Sylow 2-subgroups are Klein groups), then, for every Sylow 2-subgroup $V$ of $G$ , the three elements of order 2 of $V$ are conjugate in $N_{G}(V)$ . (Rotman 1999, Lemma 7.49, p. 196.) So, we have proved, without transfer theory, that if $G$ is a simple group whose Sylow 2-subgroups are Klein groups, then case (i) of the Statement 1 above holds. Do you think my formulation of the proof is better than Burnside's, or do I see difficulties wherd there is none?","I am reading part VIII of Burnside's ""Notes on the Theory of Groups of Finite Order"".

Burnside first proves something that I understand (in today's language) as follows : Let be a finite group whose Sylow 2-subgroups are Klein groups. Then one (and only one) of the two following cases holds : (i) for every Sylow 2-subgroup of , the three elements of order 2 of form a conjugacy class in , (and thus is divisible by 12) and all elements of order 2 in are conjugate in ; (ii) for every Sylow 2-subgroup of , the three elements of order 2 of are pairwise non-conjugate in and . I have no problem with that. Thereafter, Burnside's goal seems to be to prove that if is simple, it is the case (i) of Statement 1 that takes place. Today, it is an easy consequence of Burnside's transfer theorem : in case (ii), we have for every Sylow 2-subgroup of , thus, by Burnside's transfer theorem, cannot be simple. But Burnside doesn't use his transfer theorem here. (I presume that he had not yet stated this theorem in 1895. By the way, when and where did he publish it for the first time ? I don't find the answer on Internet.) I must confess that I don't understand this part of Burnside's paper. He considers a group, let us say , of order , with odd, he assumes that the Sylow 2-subgroups of are Klein groups and, if I understand it correctly, he notes the order of the normalizer in of a Sylow 2-subgroup of . Then he says (p. 590-591 in the Collected Papers, vol. I) : ""Suppose now that this is not the case [I understand : Suppose that we are not in case (i) of Statement 1, in other words suppose that we are in case (ii) of Statement 1.], so that the group contains 3 different conjugate sets of operations of order 2 [OK]. Every operation [Burnside says ""operation"" where we say ""element""] of order 2 is certainly self-conjugate [For an element of a group, Burnside says ""self-conjugate"" where we say ""central""; for a subgroup, he says ""self-conjugate"" where we say ""normal"".] in a sub-group of order [Indeed, every element of order 2 of is contained in a Sylow 2-subgroup of and, since we are in case (ii) of Statement 1, centralizes and thus centralizes . Recall that is the order of for every Sylow 2-subgroup of .], and may be self-conjugate in a more extensive sub-group. [In other words : is contained in and it is possible that is greater than .] Let, then, , an operation of order 2 be self-conjugate within a group of order . [I understand : let be an element of order 2 of and let be the order of .] An operation of this sub-group whose order is odd, and which is not contained in the sub-group of order , is permutable with , and with no operation of order 2 which is not conjugate to ."" What is exactly the meaning of this last sentence ? Burnside says ""THE sub-group of order "". But can belong to several Sylow 2-subgroups of . If is in a Sylow 2-subgroup of and also in another Sylow 2-subgroup of , what is ""THE sub-group of order "" ? or ? In any case, I think that the following statement is wrong : (not from Burnside, and wrong). Let be a finite group whose Sylow 2-subgroups are Klein groups. Assume that case (ii) of Statement 1 holds, so that, for every Sylow 2-subgroup of , the three elements of order 2 of are pairwise non-conjugate in and . Let be an element of order 2 of , let be a Sylow 2-subgroup of containing , let be an element of odd order in and assume that is not in . Then all elements of order 2 in are conjugate in . Here is a counterexample. Let be a nonabelian group of order 21. Then is a semidirect product , where is an element of order 7, an element of order 3 and . By von Dyck's theorem, or whatever, there exists one and only one automorphism of H such that and . Clearly, is of order 2 in . Choose a Klein group . Let be the homomorphism from to such that . Put . Clearly the Sylow 2-subgroups of are Klein groups. It is easy to check that (1) is a central element of order 2 in ; (2) is an element of order 2 in and it commutes with , which is an element of order 3 in ; (3) is an element of order 2 in and it doesn't commute with . From (1), it results that is conjugate to no element of other than itself. Since (for example by (2) ), has at least one other element of order 2 than , it is not true that all the elements of order 2 in are conjugate in . Thus we are not in case (i) of Statement 1, thus (4) it is case (ii) of Statement 1 which holds, Put . In view of (1) and (3), is a Sylow 2-subgroup of , commutes with , is not in . Thus, if Statement 2 was true, all the elements of order 2 of commuting with should be conjugate to eachother in . It is false, since, by (1) and (2), both and are elements of order 2 commuting with , but they are not conjugate in (since is central in ). Thus Statement 2 is wrong. So my question is : do you think that Burnside's proof is correct and, if it is the case, could you make it clearer ? I will now copy the whole proof of Burnside. Maybe it can help you understand his ideas. ""Suppose now that this is not the case, so that the group contains 3 different conjugate sets of operations of order 2. Every operation of order 2 is certainly self-conjugate in a sub-group of order , and may be self-conjugate in a more extensive sub-group. Let, then, , an operation of order 2 be self-conjugate within a group of order . An operation of this sub-group whose order is odd, and which is not contained in the sub-group of order , is permutable with , and with no operation of order 2 which is not conjugate to . Hence it must form one of a set of conjugate operations , where is odd. If now the group be represented as a permutation group, consisting of the permutations of these operations among themselves which arise by transforming them by all the operations of the group, any operation of order 2 which is not conjugate to will give a substitution in the permutation-group, consisting in transpositions, i.e. an odd substitution, and, therefore, the group cannot be simple. Hence, the group is certainly not simple unless the maximum sub-group, which contains an operation of order 2 self-conjugately, is of order ; and when this condition is satisfied every operation of order 2 is permutable with just 2 other operations of order 2, and with no more. But, now, if , are two operations of order 2 belonging to different conjugate sets, and if , , generate a dihedral group of order . If were odd, and would be conjugate, which is not the case. Hence, must be even, and then is an operation of order 2 which is permutable with distinct pairs [?] of operations of order 2. But this is in direct contradiction to what has just been proved, so that this case cannot occur. It follows that, if a group whose order is ( odd) contains 3 different conjugate sets of operations of order 2, it cannot be simple."" (May 22, 2021). I still feel that Burnside's proof is not absolutely correct, but I think it can be fixed (without use of transfer theory), by use of Burnside's ideas. Let be a finite simple group whose Sylow 2-subgroups are Klein groups and let us prove that all the elements of order 2 in are conjugate. Let a finite simple group, let be an element of such that the number of conjugates of in is of the form , with odd. Then, for every element of order 2 in , there exists at least one G-conjugate of which commutes with . Proof. Let denote the set of conjugates of in . From the hypotheses, has more than an element, thus the simple group is nonabelian and acts nontrivially on by conjugation, thus the permutation is even. If commuted with no conjugate of , this permutation should be the product of transpositions (with disjoint supports) and should thus be odd, contradiction. Let be a group, let two elements of order 2 in , not conjugate with each other in . Assume that has finite order . Then is a dihedral group of order and is even. Proof. The fact that is a dihedral group of order is classical (Rotman 1999, theor. 3.32, p. 68). Assume (absurdly) that is odd. Then the order of is even and not divisible by 4, thus the Sylow 2-subgroups of are its subgroups of order 2, thus (Sylow) all the subgroups of order 2 of are conjugate in , thus all the elements of order 2 of are conjugate in , thus and are conjugate in and thus in , contradiction. Here is another proof that is even. If was odd, say , we would have , thus and would be conjugate, contradiction. Let a finite simple group whose Sylow 2-subgroups are Klein groups. Then all the elements of order 2 of are conjugate. Proof. Assume first that (hyp. 1) there exists an element of such that the number of conjugates of is of the form , with odd. Then, by Lemma 1, every element of order 2 of commutes with (at least) one conjugate of . In other words, (2) every element of order 2 of is conjugate in with an element (of order 2) of . On the other hand, since the order of is divisible by 4 and not by 8, it results from (1) that is divisible by 2 and not by 4. Thus the Sylow 2-subgroups of are its subgroups of order 2, thus (Sylow) the subgroups of order 2 of are conjugate in , which amounts to say that the elements of order 2 of are conjugate in . With (2), this proves that all the elements of order 2 of are conjugate in . Thus the theorem is true in our hypothesis (1), thus we can assume that this hypothesis is not satisfied, i.e. (3) for every element of , the number of conjugates of in is odd or divisible by 4. Assume that (absurdly), (hyp.4) there exist two elements and of order 2 of which are not conjugate in . Let denote the order of . By Lemma 2, is even and is a dihedral group of order (and thus of order divisible by 4). Assume that (absurdly) (hyp. 5) is not equal to 2. Then, since is even and has no element of order 4, is not a power of 2, thus the dihedral group has at least one element of odd prime order , In a dihedral group, every element of odd order is conjugate to its inverse, thus and are conjugate in . A fortiori, (6) and are conjugate in . Let be a conjugate of in . Then is of order . Since is odd and , and are distinct. Moreover, in view of (6), and are conjugate in . Thus the conjugates of in are in even number, thus, in view of (3), the number of conjugates of in is divisible by 4. Since the order of is divisible by 4 and not by 8, this implies that (7) is odd. But , being of order different from 2, is in the unique cyclic subgroup of index 2 of the dihedral group . Since is abelian, centralizes , thus contains . But the order of is and is thus even, thus is even, which contradicts (7). Thus our hypothesis (5) is false, thus (always in our hypothesis 4), , in other words the order of is 2, which implies that and commute. Thus we have proved that (8) for all elements of order 2 of which are not conjugate in , and commute. If and are two such elements, then, every conjugate of in is an element of order 2 which is not conjugate to , thus the hypotheses on and in (8) are satisfied by and , thus every conjugate of commutes with , thus (9) the subgroup of generated by the conjugates of is contained in . But the subgroup of generated by the conjugates of is a nontrivial normal subgroup of , thus, since is assumed to be simple, the subgroup of generated by the conjugates of is the whole , thus (9) means that , thus is central in , which is impossible, since is a nonabelian simple group. Thus our hypothesis (4) is absurd, which proves the theorem. We can conclude from this theorem that (if is a simple group whose Sylow 2-subgroups are Klein groups), then, for every Sylow 2-subgroup of , the three elements of order 2 of are conjugate in . (Rotman 1999, Lemma 7.49, p. 196.) So, we have proved, without transfer theory, that if is a simple group whose Sylow 2-subgroups are Klein groups, then case (i) of the Statement 1 above holds.

For instance, the identity homomorphism $G \geq S\to S$ cannot be extended if (surjective) homomorphisms $G\to S$ don't even exist at all.

Let us call this statement ""Burnside's non-simplicity theorem"". Let $G$ be a group of order $4400$. Let $n_{5}(G)$ denote the number of Sylow $5$-subgroups of $G$. In a proof that G is not simple, W.R. Scott (12.3.5, p. 335) uses  Burnside's non-simplicity theorem, and thus character theory (since Scott proves Burnside's non-simplicity theorem by use of character theory), in the case where $n_{5}(G) = 11$. He settles the other cases without character theory. In fact, if I'm not wrong, it is not very difficult to avoid character theory, by use of the following lemma: (Edit : the following lemma is the result of an improvement made by j.p. to my initial formulation.) Lemma. Let $H$ be a finite group, let $p$ be a prime divisor of  $\vert H \vert$. Let $n_{p}(H)$ denote the number of Sylow $p$-subgroups of $H$. Assume that 1° $n_{p}(H)$ is the least divisor $d$ of $\vert H \vert$ such that $d > 1$ and $d \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$; 2°  $n_{p}(H) \not\equiv 1 \pmod{p^{r}}$, where $p^{r}$ denotes the greatest power of $p$ that divides $\vert H \vert$ (in other words, $p^{r}$ is the order of the Sylow $p$-subgroups of $H$). Then $H$ is not simple. Proof. In view of a strong form of the Sylow congruence theorem, we conclude from hypothesis 2° that we can choose two distinct Sylow $p$-subgroups of $H$, say $P$ and $Q$, such that $P \cap Q > 1$. We may additionally assume that $P\cap Q$ is maximal among the intersection of two Sylow $p$-subgroups. Let $N:=N_H(P\cap Q)$ be the normalizer of this intersection in $H$. As $P$ and $Q$ are (finite) $p$-groups, $N\cap P$ and $N\cap Q$ both properly contain $P\cap Q$. $N\cap P$ and $N\cap Q$ are contained in Sylow $p$-subgroups $P'$ rsp. $Q'$ of $N$, which in turn are contained in Sylow $p$-subgroups $P''$ rsp. $Q''$ of $H$. By maximality of $P\cap Q$ we get $P=P''$ and $Q=Q''$ and hence that $N\cap P = P'$ and $N\cap Q = Q'$ are (different) Sylow $p$-subgroups of $N$, thus $N$ has more than one Sylow $p$-subgroup. On the other hand, by Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow $p$-subgroups of $N$ is $\equiv 1 \pmod{p}$ and divides $\vert N\vert$, which divides $\vert H \vert$. Thus the number of Sylow $p$-subgroups of $N$ is $> 1$, is $\equiv 1 \pmod{p}$ and divides  $\vert H \vert$. By minimality of $n_{p}(H)$ (hypothesis 1°), (*) the number of Sylow $p$-subgroups of $N$ is $\geq n_{p}(H)$. As $P\cap Q$ is normal in $N$, every Sylow $p$-subgroup of $N$ contains $P\cap Q$. But, as by the maximality of $P\cap Q$ every Sylow $p$-subgroup of $N$ is contained in a unique different Sylow $p$-subgroup of $H$, by (*) every Sylow $p$-subgroup of $H$ contains some Sylow $p$-subgroup of $N$, and hence $P\cap Q$. Thus the intersection of all Sylow $p$-subgroups of $H$, which is a normal subgroup, is non-trivial, and thus $H$ is not simple. Applying this lemma with $H = G$ (where $\vert G \vert = 4400$) and $p = 5$, we find that if $n_{5}(G) = 11$, then $G$ is not simple. Thus, in each case, it can be proved without character theory that a group of order $4400$ is not simple. In exerc. 12.3.10, p. 337, W.R. Scott asks for a proof that there are no simple groups of order $1200$, $2240$ or $2800$. I presume that use of Burnside's non-simplicity theorem is expected, but here again, if I'm not wrong, character theory can be skipped. My question is : do you know a nonzero natural number $n$ with at least $3$ distinct prime factors such that (i) it is relatively easy to prove that there is no simple group of order $n$ with use of  Burnside's non-simplicity theorem; (ii) it is not easy to prove it without Burnside's non-simplicity theorem and without character theory ?

Lemma. Let $H$ be a finite group, let $p$ be a prime divisor of  $\vert H \vert$. Let $n_{p}(H)$ denote the number of Sylow $p$-subgroups of $H$. Assume that 1° $n_{p}(H)$ is the least divisor $d$ of $\vert H \vert$ such that $d > 1$ and $d \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$; 2°  $n_{p}(H) \not\equiv 1 \pmod{p^{r}}$, where $p^{r}$ denotes the greatest power of $p$ that divides $\vert H \vert$ (in other words, $p^{r}$ is the order of the Sylow $p$-subgroups of $H$). Then $H$ is not simple. Proof. In view of a strong form of the Sylow congruence theorem, we conclude from hypothesis 2° that we can choose two distinct Sylow $p$-subgroups of $H$, say $P$ and $Q$, such that $P \cap Q > 1$. We may additionally assume that $P\cap Q$ is maximal among the intersection of two Sylow $p$-subgroups. Let $N:=N_H(P\cap Q)$ be the normalizer of this intersection in $H$. As $P$ and $Q$ are (finite) $p$-groups, $N\cap P$ and $N\cap Q$ both properly contain $P\cap Q$. $N\cap P$ and $N\cap Q$ are contained in Sylow $p$-subgroups $P'$ rsp. $Q'$ of $N$, which in turn are contained in Sylow $p$-subgroups $P''$ rsp. $Q''$ of $H$. By maximality of $P\cap Q$ we get $P=P''$ and $Q=Q''$ and hence that $N\cap P = P'$ and $N\cap Q = Q'$ are (different) Sylow $p$-subgroups of $N$, thus $N$ has more than one Sylow $p$-subgroup. On the other hand, by Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow $p$-subgroups of $N$ is $\equiv 1 \pmod{p}$ and divides $\vert N\vert$, which divides $\vert H \vert$. Thus the number of Sylow $p$-subgroups of $N$ is $> 1$, is $\equiv 1 \pmod{p}$ and divides  $\vert H \vert$. By minimality of $n_{p}(H)$ (hypothesis 1°), (*) the number of Sylow $p$-subgroups of $N$ is $\geq n_{p}(H)$. As $P\cap Q$ is normal in $N$, every Sylow $p$-subgroup of $N$ contains $P\cap Q$. But, as by the maximality of $P\cap Q$ every Sylow $p$-subgroup of $N$ is contained in a unique different Sylow $p$-subgroup of $H$, by (*) every Sylow $p$-subgroup of $H$ contains some Sylow $p$-subgroup of $N$, and hence $P\cap Q$. Thus the intersection of all Sylow $p$-subgroups of $H$, which is a normal subgroup, is non-trivial, and thus $H$ is not simple. Applying this lemma with $H = G$ (where $\vert G \vert = 4400$) and $p = 5$, we find that if $n_{5}(G) = 11$, then $G$ is not simple. Thus, in each case, it can be proved without character theory that a group of order $4400$ is not simple. In exerc. 12.3.10, p. 337, W.R. Scott asks for a proof that there are no simple groups of order $1200$, $2240$ or $2800$. I presume that use of Burnside's non-simplicity theorem is expected, but here again, if I'm not wrong, character theory can be skipped. My question is : do you know a nonzero natural number $n$ with at least $3$ distinct prime factors such that (i) it is relatively easy to prove that there is no simple group of order $n$ with use of  Burnside's non-simplicity theorem; (ii) it is not easy to prove it without Burnside's non-simplicity theorem and without character theory ?

77,Stirling numbers and Power Group Enumeration,Stirling numbers and Power Group Enumeration,,"The following question is  a reference request concerning a derivation of the EGF for the Stirling numbers of the second kind by Power Group Enumeration / Burnside's Lemma, which is $$\sum_{n\ge 0} {n\brace k} \frac{z^n}{n!} = \frac{(\exp(z)-1)^k}{k!}.$$ The idea  is very  simple. The labelled  set partitions  that Stirling numbers count can  be represented by placing one of $k$ colors into a row of $n$ adjacent slots, where $n$ is the set being partitioned and $k$ gives the number of components. Hence a color signals what set the value corresponding to the slot should belong to. The value of ${n\brace k}$ is then given by the number of orbits under the power  group action  obtained by letting  the group acting  on the slots  be the  identity and  the  group acting  on the  colors be  the symmetric group  on $k$ elements $S_k.$ Now applying Burnside  we see that the group acting on  the slots consists of one element containing $n$ fixed  points.  The admissible  assignments to these  fixed points under a  permutation $\beta$ acting on  the colors are  those that are fixed  points of $\beta.$ If  we have $q$ such  fixed points  we can obtain $q^n$ valid  assignments  to  the slots  under  the  identity permutation. We thus require  the cycle index of the  symmetric group $Z(S_k)$ with the fixed points marked. Recall that the OGF of these cycle indices is obtained from the combinatorial class $$\def\textsc#1{\dosc#1\csod} \def\dosc#1#2\csod{{\rm #1{\small #2}}} \textsc{SET}(\mathcal{A_1}\times\textsc{CYC}_1(\mathcal{W}) + \mathcal{A_2}\times\textsc{CYC}_2(\mathcal{W}) + \mathcal{A_3}\times\textsc{CYC}_3(\mathcal{W})  + \cdots)$$ which gives $$\exp\left(a_1 w + a_2 \frac{w^2}{2} + a_3 \frac{w^3}{3} + \cdots  \right).$$ Keeping only the marker on the fixed points we obtain $$G(w, v) = \exp\left(v w + \frac{w^2}{2} + \frac{w^3}{3} + \cdots\right) \\ = \exp\left(v w - w + \log\frac{1}{1-w}\right) = \frac{e^{-w}}{1-w} e^{vw}.$$ We  now  determine  the  transformation required  of  this  generating function. A  term $C v^q w^m$ must be transformed into $C q^n w^m.$ This gives $$\left.\left(v\frac{d}{dv}\right)^n G(w, v) \right|_{v=1}.$$ Observe however that  this term is a generating  function of colorings where the term $w^k$ indexes colorings of at  most $k$ colors. That means we  actually require the difference between  the coefficients on $w^k$ and on $w^{k-1}.$ This finally yields the formula $${n\brace k} =  [w^k] (1-w) \left.\left(v\frac{d}{dv}\right)^n G(w, v) \right|_{v=1}.$$ Substituting the actual value of $G(w, v)$ and moving constants to the front we obtain $${n\brace k} = [w^k] e^{-w} \left.\left(v\frac{d}{dv}\right)^n e^{vw} \right|_{v=1}.$$ Introduce the generating function $$P(z) = \sum_{n\ge 0} {n\brace k} \frac{z^n}{n!} = [w^k] e^{-w} \left.\sum_{n\ge 0} \frac{z^n}{n!}  \left(v\frac{d}{dv}\right)^n e^{vw} \right|_{v=1}.$$ Now the operator represented by the sum turns $v^q w^m$ into $$\left(1 + \frac{zq}{1!}  + \frac{(zq)^2}{2!} + \frac{(zq)^3}{3!} + \cdots\right) \times v^q \times w^m = e^{zq} \times v^q \times w^m.$$ This yields for $P(z)$ that $${\large P(z) = [w^k] e^{-w} \left. e^{\exp(z)\times v \times w}\right|_{v=1}} \\= {\large [w^k] e^{-w} e^{\exp(z) w} = [w^k] e^{(\exp(z)-1) w}.}$$ So that finally $$\color{#A00}{P(z)= \frac{(\exp(z)-1)^k}{k!}}.$$ This concludes the proof.
