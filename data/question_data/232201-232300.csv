42,Understanding Set Notation,Understanding Set Notation,,"I'm having some trouble understanding a definition and explanation in my textbook Introduction to Analysis by Edward Gaughan 5th edition . The book begins with some preliminary information about sets and some of the information is sort of confusing and I have a feeling that in this sort of class if you don't understand the basics you are doomed. So hopefully somebody out there can help me understand the confusing bits a little better. So the definition in question is as follows: Let $\Lambda$ be a set, and suppose for each $\lambda \in \Lambda$ , a subset $A_{\lambda}$ of a given set S is specified. The collection of sets $A_{\lambda}$ is called an indexed family of subsets of S with $\Lambda$ as the index set. We denote this by ${\{ A \}}_{\lambda \in \Lambda}$ If ${\{ A \}}_{\lambda \in \Lambda}$ is an indexed family of sets, define $\cap_{\lambda \in \Lambda}$ $A_{\lambda}$ = {x : x $\in A_{\lambda}$ for all $\lambda \in \Lambda$ } $\cup_{\lambda \in \Lambda}$ $A_{\lambda}$ = {x : x $\in A_{\lambda}$ for some $\lambda \in \Lambda$ } Alright so the definition above I thought was straightforward, but then the text goes on to say this: There is one logical difficulty here that needs to be pointed out. If $\Lambda$ is the empty set, then it is easy to see that $\cup_{\lambda \in \Lambda} A_{\lambda}$ is empty; however, it is not clear what to expect of $\cap_{\lambda \in \Lambda} A_{\lambda}$ . The bolded explanation is what I do not understand. If $\Lambda$ is the empty set there will be no subsets to union because there are no elements $\lambda \in \Lambda$ but why is it not clear that $\cap_{\lambda \in \Lambda} A_{\lambda}$ is also empty, won't there also be no subsets $A_{\lambda}$ to seek the intersection of?? The text ends with the following conclusion: In a context where all sets considered are understood to be subsets of a given set S, the common usage is to let: S = $\cap_{\lambda \in \oslash} A_{\lambda}$ Any information would be appreciated.","I'm having some trouble understanding a definition and explanation in my textbook Introduction to Analysis by Edward Gaughan 5th edition .

Moreover, $p$ is covering map , which means the following. For any point in $\mathbb{R}^{2}\backslash\left\{ \mathbf{0}\right\} $ one can find an open, path-connected neighborhood $U$ whose preimage $p^{-1}\left(U\right)$ is a non-empty, disjoint union of sets $U_{\lambda},\lambda\in\Lambda,$ such that $p\vert_{U_{\lambda}}:U_{\lambda}\to U$ is a homeomorphism for each $\lambda$ in the relevant index set $\Lambda.$ (You are asked to verify this property in Exercise 1.3) Exercise 1.3: Verify the map $p$ in Remark 1.4 is a covering map in the sense described there. As an index set one can take $\Lambda=\mathbb{Z}.$ How does one have to chose the neighborhood $U$ of a given point in $\mathbb{R}^{2}\backslash\left\{ \mathbf{0}\right\} ?$ I have multiple questions about this, but I will only pose one in this post. What is meant by ""a non-empty, disjoint union of sets""? The non-empty part is easy.  I take disjoint to mean that no point in $p^{-1}\left(U\right)$ is in more than one $U_\lambda.$ The path-connected property of $U$ says that there is a continuous path connecting every pair of points in $U.$ If $\mathbf{p}_1$ lies in $p\left(U_1\right)$ and $\mathbf{p}_2$ lies in $p\left(U_2\right)$ ,  apparently the preimage of a path connecting $\mathbf{p}_1$ and $\mathbf{p}_2$ is a path in $p^{-1}\left(U\right)$ connecting a point of $U_1$ and a point of $U_2,$ even though they are disjoint.

For any point in one can find an open, path-connected neighborhood whose preimage is a non-empty, disjoint union of sets such that is a homeomorphism for each in the relevant index set (You are asked to verify this property in Exercise 1.3) Exercise 1.3: Verify the map in Remark 1.4 is a covering map in the sense described there. As an index set one can take How does one have to chose the neighborhood of a given point in I have multiple questions about this, but I will only pose one in this post. What is meant by ""a non-empty, disjoint union of sets""? The non-empty part is easy.  I take disjoint to mean that no point in is in more than one The path-connected property of says that there is a continuous path connecting every pair of points in If lies in and lies in ,  apparently the preimage of a path connecting and is a path in connecting a point of and a point of even though they are disjoint.

Lemma: $\bigcap\limits_{n=1}^{k} A_n=\bigcap\limits_{n=1}^{k-1} A_n \cap A_k$ Let $x\in \bigcap\limits_{n=1}^{k} A_n$ , then by definition of intersection, $x\in A_1, x \in A_2...x\in A_{k}$ .

We can conclude that $\bigcap\limits_{n=1}^{k} A_n = \bigcap\limits_{n=1}^{k-1} A_n \cap A_k$ . To prove 1) we use mathematical induction. Let $S$ be a subset of $\mathbb{N}$ so that if $k \in S$ , if $A_1 \supseteq A_2  · · ·\supseteq A_k$ are all sets containing an infinite number of elements, then the intersection $\bigcap\limits_{n=1}^{k} A_n$ is infinite as well.

I think I know how to solve them in general, but I am confused as to why set A has a ""is member of"" symbol ( ) in it. I've never seen this before and was wondering if it's some special type of notation or if rather the symbol is merely an arbitary element."," A = \{ \in, a \}   B = \{ ab \}   A^2   B^3   AB   A = \{ \in, a \}   B = \{ ab \}   A^*   B^*   B+  \in","['elementary-set-theory', 'notation']"
99,Well-ordering on natural numbers,Well-ordering on natural numbers,,"Let $\omega=\{0,1,2,3,\ldots\}$ . We say that $\omega$ is a well-ordered set. But I can't understand why. By the definition of well-ordering, there should be no infinite descending chain, but if I start from infinity, how can I reach 0 in finite descents? Or is this not allowed? Is this nonsensical to choose infinity? Then what about $\omega+1$ ? Is this set well-ordered? How can I reach to $0$ from $\omega$ ?","Let . We say that is a well-ordered set.
