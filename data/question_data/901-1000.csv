Lemma-1: $||.||_{\infty}$ is a norm on $L^{\infty}$ Proof: Suppose that $||f||_{\infty}=0$.  Let $A=\{x \in X : f(x) \ne 0\} $ and $A_n=\{x \in X: |f(x)| \gt \frac{1}{n}\}$ . Then $A=\cup_{n}A_n$. Then there exists $'a'$ such that $\mu\left(\{x: |f(x)| \gt a\}\right)=0$ and $a \lt \frac{1}{n}$ (by the definition of $||f||_{\infty}$). Thus $$\mu\left(\{x: |f(x)| \gt \frac{1}{n}\}\right) \le \mu\left(\{x: |f(x)| \gt a\}\right)=0$$ $\implies \mu(A_n)=0$ and hence $\mu(A)=0$. Thus $f =0 ,\mu$-a.e. Now $$|f(x)+g(x)| \le |f(x)| +|g(x)| \le ||f||_{\infty}|+||g||_{\infty} ,\mu-\text{a.e}$$ Thus $||f+g||_{\infty} \le ||f||_{\infty}+||g||_{\infty}$ Now $$||\lambda f||_{\infty}=\inf\{a \ge 0: \mu\left(\{x: |\lambda f(x)| \gt a\}\right)=0\}$$ $$=\inf\{|\lambda|a \ge 0:\mu\left(\{x: |\lambda||f(x)| \gt |\lambda|a\}\right)=0\}$$ $$=|\lambda|\inf\{a \ge 0:\mu\left(\{x: |f(x)| \gt a\}\right)=0\}=|\lambda|||f||_{\infty}$$ Lemma-2: $||f_n-f||_{\infty} \to 0$ iff there exists $E \in \mathcal{M}$ such that $\mu(E^c)=0$ and $f_n \to f$ uniformly on $E$.

It resembles the scalar product $\int_{-1}^1 u(t)v(t) \,\mathrm{d}t$, which leads to Legendre polynomials , with a major difference: while the latter is a scalar product over continuous functions, the former is not, since for $f(t)=e^t$, $(f|f)=0$. However, it's obviously a scalar product over polynomials (the solutions of $(f|f)=0$ are not polynomials, and all other defining properties of a scalar product are trivial). We can therefore find an orthonormal basis of polynomials, using Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization on the basis $[1,t,t^2,...]$. Let's call $P_n$ this orthonormal basis. Now, after doing this numerically with a CAS, and after some plots, it looks like $\frac{P_n}{P_n(0)}$ tends uniformly to the function $t \to e^t$ (on $[0,1]$), a solution of $y'-y=0$, which is closely related to the definition of the scalar product above. But I don't know how to prove this. Any idea? Also, if I do the same with $(u|v)=\int_0^1 (u''(t)-u(t))(v''(t)-v(t)) \,\mathrm{d}t$, I'm not absolutely sure, but numerically it looks like, up to a constant factor $P_{2n} \to \cos t$ and $P_{2n+1} \to \sin t$, uniformly on $[0,1]$, so the orthogonal basis of polynomials leads to a basis of solutions of $y''-y=0$. I'd like to know if the process can be generalized to other linear differential equations (provided they don't have polynomial solutions). Does it work with equations with nonconstant coefficients? This is not homework. It's something I discovered while playing with a Ti89 long ago (initially, to test a program doing Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization), and I have never been able to prove or disprove the numerical evidence. $\color{red}{\textbf{Now, why this question?}}$ Apart from mathematical curiosity, there may be some motivation: the method seems quite robust, there is convergence, probably under certain conditions, for several weight functions and differential equations. And we get uniform approximation of solutions of linear differential equations, by polynomials, which may be quite useful in practice. Since many linear ODE give rise to special functions, that would give a cheap way to compute uniform approximations of their solutions, on arbitrary (but bounded) intervals. To help visualize, here are some sample graphics done with Maxima, computed with a straightforward Gram-Schmidt algorithm. The two following are $P_4(x)/P_4(0)-\exp(x)$ and $P_9(x)/P_9(0)-\exp(x)$, in the case $(u|v) = \int_0^1 (u(t)'-u(t))(v(t)'-v(t)) \,\mathrm{d}t$. The division by $P_n(0)$ is only done in order to ""normalize"" polynomials, since $\exp 0=1$. Now example with ""trigonometric"" differential equation $y''+y=0$. And $(u|v) = \int_0^{2\pi} (u(t)''+u(t))(v(t)''+v(t)) \,\mathrm{d}t$. Notice the integration bound differ from the preceding, and now uniform convergence of $P_n$ takes place on $[0,2\pi]$. The normalization is here $P_{2n}(x)/P_{2n}(0)$ as $\cos 0 = 1$ ans $P_{2n+1}(x)/P_{2n+1}(\pi/2)$, as $\sin \pi/2=1$, and precisely, $P_{8}(x)/P_{8}(0)-\cos x$ and $P_{9}(x)/P_{9}(\pi/2)-\sin x$ are respectively plotted. Notice, it's also possible to add a weighting function to our scalar product, e.g. $(u|v) = \int_0^1 (u(t)'-u(t))(v(t)'-v(t)) \mathcal{W}(t)\,\mathrm{d}t$. For example, with$\mathcal{W}(t)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{t(1-t)}}$ on $[0,1]$, there is still convergence, and for example $P_9(x)/P_9(0) -\exp x$ yields the following plot.","Given two functions $u$ and $v$, you can compute $(u|v) = \int_0^1 (u(t)'-u(t))(v(t)'-v(t)) \,\mathrm{d}t$.

More pecisely, for the proof, we define: $$\varphi_{\delta}(f)=\sup\{\varphi(h): \mbox{ supp}\,h\in N(\delta), 0\leq h\leq f\},$$ for $\delta>0$, $$\varphi_{0}(f)=\lim\limits_{\delta \to 0^+}\varphi_{\delta}(f),$$ for $f\in C(X), f\geq 0$, and $$\varphi_{0}(f)=\varphi_{0}(f^+)-\varphi_{0}(f^-),$$ for $f \in C(X)$, where $N(\delta)$ is a family of sets that possess a covering composed of finite number of open balls with a radius equal to $\delta$. My question concerns the truth of the following sentence:  Let $X$ be a $\sigma$-compact and polish space. Assume that $\varphi^x:C(X) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a positive linear functional, for all $x \in X$ and let $((\varphi^x)_0,(\varphi^x)_*)$ be a couple of Banach-Riesz functionals, for $x \in X$. If the mapping $X \ni x \mapsto  \varphi^x(f)$ is continuous for all $f \in C(X)$ and $\varphi^x(1_X)=1$, for $x \in X$, then mapping $X \ni x \mapsto  (\varphi^x)_0(f)$ is continuous for all $f \in C(X)$ (or may be for only $f \in C_c(X)$). I was able to proof only that the mapping $X \ni x \mapsto  (\varphi^x)_0(f)$ is upper semi-continuous, for $f\in C_c(X)$.",,"['real-analysis', 'probability-theory', 'measure-theory']"

Show that $\ f$ is measurable.  If we only assume that $\ f(\cdot,y)$ is measurable for each $y\in[0,1]$ , rather than continuous, can we still conclude that $f$ is measurable?

Furthermore, we clearly have that $$ A_n:=\{(x,y)\in[0,1]^2 \ | \ f_n(x,y)>\alpha\} \qquad\qquad\qquad $$ $$ \qquad\qquad \ =\bigcup_{i=1}^{n-1}\bigg(\bigg[\frac{i}{n},\frac{i+1}{n}\bigg)\times \bigg\{y\in[0,1] \ \bigg| \ \ f\bigg(\frac{i}{n},y\bigg)>\alpha \bigg\}\bigg). $$ Since $ \ f\big(\tfrac{i}{n},\cdot\big)$ is measurable for each $i=1,\cdots,n$ , the latter expression is a union of measurable sets.  This means that $ \ A_n$ is measurable, and therefore $ \ f_n$ is measurable for each $n\geq 1$ .

Proposition: Let $f:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}^2$ be open and closed. If $x_n\to x$ and $f(x_n)$ is bounded, then $f(x_n)\to f(x)$ . Proof of 1: Let $f(x_{n_i})$ be a convergent subsequence of $f(x_n)$ with limit $p$ . For all $i$ let $y_i=x_{n_i}$ if $f(x_{n_i})\neq p$ . Otherwise, let $r=d(x_{n_i},x)$ . Then $B_r(x_{n_i})$ is open, so $f(B_r(x_{n_i}))$ is open as well. So $f(B_r(x_{n_i}))\cap B_r(p)\setminus\{p\}$ is not empty. So we can choose $y_i\in B_r(x_{n_i})$ such that $f(y_i)\in B_r(p)\setminus\{p\}$ . We find $y_i\to x$ and $f(y_i)\to p$ and $f(y_i)\neq p$ for all $i$ . Let $S=\{y_i:i\in\mathbb{N}\}$ . We find that $p$ is a limit point of $f(S)$ not contained in $f(S)$ . However, $C=S\cup\{x\}$ is closed, so $f(C)$ is also closed, and hence contains $p$ . We conclude $f(x)=p$ , so $f(x_{n_i})\to f(x)$ . Assume for the contrary that $f(x_n)\not\to f(x)$ . Then there is a subsequence of $f(x_n)$ that always stays a certain distance from $f(x)$ . By the Bolzano Weierstrass theorem, this subsequence itself has a convergent subsequence. By the previous observation, this subsequence converges to $f(x)$ . This contradicts the fact that it always stays a certain distance from $f(x)$ . $\square$ If you manage to prove that such a function does not exist, it might be neat to also look at how general the domain and codomain of $f$ can be made. For example, all arguments in the proposition still work for $f:X\to Y$ with any metric space $X$ , and any finite dimensional vector space $Y$ . However, with tweaking the arguments only a bit you find the following. Let $X$ be a first countable Hausdorff topological space, and let $Y$ be a first countable topological space with no isolated points. Let $f:X\to Y$ be open and closed. If $x_n\to x$ and $f(x_n)$ is contained in some sequentially compact set, then $f(x_n)\to f(x)$ . Anyways, please let me know your thoughts.","Does there exist a function that is open and closed, but not continuous? Note that I require to be defined on the entirety of .

99,A natural discovery of $e$ as $\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^n$ - what is unrigorous here?,A natural discovery of  as  - what is unrigorous here?,e \lim_{n\to\infty}\left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^n,"I had an interesting conversation with my teacher today, and we were discussing what the best foot forward for me might be. He asked me to differentiate $e^x$ from first principles, which I did, and then challenged me on: Begin by defining $e$ as: $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^n$$ He wondered if I found this satisfactory, intuitively speaking. I said: ""this is just one of the fundamental and historic definitions of $e$ "", and he asked me - ""why?"" And I just couldn't answer beyond repeating: ""it's the definition"". On that note he then showed a more natural exploration that leads to a discovery of this definition of $e$ . He did declare this exploration to be ""cheating"", which is the focus of my question. Take $a$ to be a positive real number. Then: $$\begin{align}\lim_{h\to0}\frac{a^{x+h}-a^h}{h}=a^x\lim_{h\to0}\frac{a^h-1}{h}\end{align}$$ And by exploration with graphs, one intuitively sees that the latter term, the derivative of $a^x$ at $0$ , clearly should exist, and that there should exist some base $a$ for which this derivative is $1$ . Exploring this possibility, define: $$(h_n)_{n\in\Bbb N}=\frac{1}{n}$$ And for each $h_n$ , ask which $a$ satisfies: $$\frac{a^{h_n}-1}{h_n}=1$$ And naturally define a sequence $(a_n)$ that solves this equation: $$(a_n)_{n\in\Bbb N}=(1+h_n)^{1/h_n}$$ This leads to the idea that the mystery $a$ for which the derivative of $a^x$ at zero equals $1$ can be found by considering the limits of the sequence $a_n$ , as $h_n$ goes to $0$ . This finds: $$\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n=\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^n$$ And we call this number $e$ . The exploration leads one to suspect that $e$ satisfies $\frac{d}{dx}e^x=1$ . However, he did mention that, in the interests of me studying real analysis, that this approach is ""cheating"" a little somehow, and that it is not a fully rigorous derivation of that limit. He hinted that I would see why this is shortly after properly studying real analysis. I have seen a good deal of calculus and analysis around the Internet, in a very erratic way, so I have only some sense of why this approach is unrigorous. However, there are many many people on this forum who have properly studied real analysis, and I am asking for your help in explaining either what's wrong, or how to make it right. My thoughts: We have not shown that $a^x$ is sequentially convergent, nor have we shown that $(a_n)$ converges. Showing that there exists $(a_n),(h_n)$ such that: $$\lim_{n\to\infty}h_n=0,\,\frac{a_n^{h_n}-1}{h_n}=1$$ Is not the same as showing that: $$\lim_{h\to0}\frac{(\lim_{n\to\infty}(a_n))^h-1}{h}=1$$ Any insight into $(1),(2)$ or anything else here would be greatly appreciated - especially any insight into how to make it fully rigorous! I just intuitively feel that $(2)$ is correct, but I cannot know for sure.","I had an interesting conversation with my teacher today, and we were discussing what the best foot forward for me might be.
