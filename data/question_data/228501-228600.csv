0,An issue with the Kuratowski ordered pair definition,An issue with the Kuratowski ordered pair definition,,"I recently came across the Kuratowski definition of ordered pairs ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_pair#Defining_the_ordered_pair_using_set_theory ). I'm a bit confused about how the coordinates can be extracted. According to Wikipedia, if we have an ordered pair $p = (a,b) = \{\{a\}, \{a,b\}\}$, we can extract the first coordinate with $a = \bigcup \bigcap{p}$ where $\bigcup$ and $\bigcap$ are arbitrary unions and intersections respectively. According to the definition of an arbitrary intersection, $\bigcap(\{\{a\}, \{a,b\}\}) = \{a\}$. $\bigcup\{a\}$ however seems a bit problematic. For the definition of an arbitrary union to work $a$ would have to be a set. What if $a$ is e.g. a natural number? A similar issue occurs with extracting the second pair. Perhaps I'm being overly pedantic or does the definition just automatically assume that $a$ and $b$ are sets?","I recently came across the Kuratowski definition of ordered pairs ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_pair#Defining_the_ordered_pair_using_set_theory ).

Thanks in advance for any replies!","I'm not familiar with the general theorem for closed, cartesian categories (as I'm not familiar with closed, cartesian categories), but I am aware of this version of the fixed point theorem for sets: Let $A, B$ be sets. If there exists a surjective function $f: A \longrightarrow \textbf{Set}(A,B)$, then every function $g:B \longrightarrow B$ has a fixed point. I'm aware of two applications of the theorem: proving Cantor's theorem (setting $B=\{0,1\}$) and proving that $[0,1]$ is uncountable (setting $A=\mathbb{N}$, $B= \{0,1\}$, looking at binary representations). Are there any other neat applications of this fixed point theorem for sets? For instance, can we deduce the Tarski fixed point theorem for sets (every non-decreasing endofunction of a power set of a set has a fixed point) or the Cantor-Bernstein theorem using this theorem? Just thought this result was cool, and wanted to see what other things you could do with it. Thanks in advance for any replies!",,"['elementary-set-theory', 'category-theory']"

Is my proof correct?,\mathbb{Z}_+,"Question Prove: The set of all finite subsets of $\mathbb{Z}_+$ is countable I assume the following results: A countable union of countable sets is countable. A finite cartesian product of countable sets is countable. If for any set $A$ there is a bijective correspondence with some countable set $B$ , then $A$ is countable. Attempt This is my attempted proof of the statement: Proof Let $J$ denote the set of all finite subsets of $\mathbb{Z}_+$ . Then $J = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{Z}_+} J_n$ , where $J_n$ is the set of all subsets of $\mathbb{Z}_+$ with $n$ elements. We prove that $J_n$ is countable by showing that for any $n \in \mathbb{Z}_+$ there exists a bijective function $f : \mathbb{Z}_+^n \rightarrow J_n$ such that for any tuple $(k_1,k_2,...,k_n) \in \mathbb{Z}_+^n$ , the following conditions hold: The set $f(k_1, k_2,...,k_n)$ contains $n$ elements The largest element in $f(k_1,k_2,...,k_n)$ is $\sum_{i=1}^nk_i$ . We use induction. Base case $n = 1$ is trivial, since we can define a function $f(n) = \{n\}$ , which is clearly bijective and satisfies the above conditions. Thus, assume that the result holds for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}_+$ . Hence, there exists $f_k: \mathbb{Z}^k_+ \rightarrow J_k$ which is a bijection satisfying the above properties. To show that the result holds for $k+1$ , define $f : \mathbb{Z}_+^{k+1} \rightarrow J_{k+1}$ as follows: \begin{align*}     f(n_1,n_2,...,n_{k+1}) = f_k(n_1,...n_k) \cup \{n_1+n_2+n_3+...+n_{k+1}\} \end{align*} By the inductive hypothesis, the set $f_k(n_1,...,n_k)$ contains $k$ distinct elements and the largest element is $\sum_{i=1}^{k}n_i$ . Thus, since: \begin{align*}     \sum_{i=1}^{k}n_i < \sum_{i=1}^{k+1}n_i \end{align*} it follows that $f$ satisfies conditions (1) and (2). Then since $f_k$ is bijective and the last element in $f(n_1,...,n_{k+1})$ is not in $f_k(n_1,...,n_k)$ , the bijectivity of $f$ follows. Hence, the result holds for $k+1$ . Thus, since $\mathbb{Z}_+^n$ is countable and there exists a bijection $f : \mathbb{Z}_+^n \rightarrow J_n$ , it follows that $J_n$ is countable for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}_+$ . Therefore, since $J_n$ is countable, we conclude that $J = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{Z}_+} J_n $ is countable $\space \Box$ Is this proof correct? If so, how can I improve it?

I have figured out the question when it's the other way around, but I am not making any progress here. The worst thing is, I don't know how to think of such problems, and even when it was functions from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\{0, 1\}$, I would have never gotten it myself without help. When I think about this I think of the following: it's a function, so one thing can't be sent to two+ things, but two things can be sent to the same thing. So at least, we are mapping both 0 and 1 to the same element, and at most we are mapping it to two different elements. But that doesn't really give me anything...
