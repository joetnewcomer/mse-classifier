6,Probability of flopping a royal flush,Probability of flopping a royal flush,,"I have no stats training, so I am asking if I am attacking this simple statistical problem correctly. What are the chances of flopping a royal flush in Texas hold’em? My attempt: The first card dealt to the player must be either a $10,J,Q,K,$ or $A$, any suit.  So the probability of the first card deal would be $\frac{5}{13}$.  Then the second card dealt to the player must be the same suit, and one of the values mentioned above, meaning the probability is $\frac{4}{51}$.  It follows that the next three cards on the flop must be the three remaining cards needed to complete the royal flush, with probabilities: $(\frac{3}{50})(\frac{2}{49})(\frac{1}{48})$.  Therefore I believe the odds of flopping a royal flush is: $\frac{5!}{13\cdot 51\cdot 50\cdot 49\cdot 48}$ I would think that this probability would be independent of how many players are in the game.  The odds of the deck the be stacked in the perfect way according to how many players there are to give you the royal flush on the flop seem to be the same. Have I made any mistakes?

The average of $n$ values is less than or equal to the maximum of the values. Hence, for example, $10$ cannot be the most probably visited square because you visit either $8$ or $9$ with greater probability. Likewise $9$ cannot be for the same logic continuing until we see $3$ cannot be. Hence the only candidates are $1$ or $2$ .

EDIT: This problem wasn't given by a professor, it's just a question that came up while chatting with friends and is being asked out of simple curiosity (actually to settle an argument, but...) Also I'm not a native English speaker, so that's perhaps why the question wasn't clear enough. For the sake of simplicity, asume the sample group is made of random people, all equally likely to speak the language or not. My friend Jerome insists that despite what size the groups is, the chances are still 3 to 1 that no one speaks English, but I differ and gave him the example of 100 coin tosses always resulting in tails.

Why is this? The motivation for this is from a statement that says that the residual of the fitted values of a linear least squares estimator sum to 0. In other words, given some standard linear model $y = X\beta + \epsilon$ where $\epsilon$ is some random error, the least squares estimate for $\beta$ would be $\hat \beta = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty$ and the fitted value $\hat y = X\hat \beta$ or $X(X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty$. Also important to note is that $X$ is a design matrix and thus has an intercept column where all elements are $1$. Then $\mathbf{1}^T(y - \hat y) = 0$.

The level of significance is 0.05. I'm asked the following question (exam): A) We can conclude that $u=100$ B) We cannot conclude that $u\neq100$ The 2 answers are rather similar, but not the same. I would say B) but I'm not so sure given what I've read. The p-value here indicates that we cannot reject the null hypothesis, so we cannot accept H1 ? Second question: What does it mean exactly that a test is significant ? Does it mean that we can reject the null hypothesis ? Thanks in advance. Regards,",,['statistics']
91,Justifying the Normal Approx to the Binomial Distribution through MGFs,Justifying the Normal Approx to the Binomial Distribution through MGFs,,"Would absolutely love if someone could help me with this question, in a step by step way to help those who are uninitiated to Statistics and Mathematics. So, I am trying to ""prove/justify"" through MGFs how as n(the sample size) increases and goes to infinity, a standardized binomial distribution converges to the Standard Normal Distribution. So in the beginning we have $X_n $~$ Bin(n,p)$ then we standardize this $R.V.$ by subtracting the mean $E(X_n)=np$ and dividing by the $SD$ which is $np(1-p)$. After doing this, we get a new $R.V.$ with $mean=1$ and $variance=SD=1$. It is the distribution of this standardized quantity that converges to a fixed distribution, correct? Namely the Standard Normal Distribution. Let's call the standardized version of $X_n$, $Z_n$. I think what we need to do is to find the MGF of $Z_n$ and show that this MGF becomes the Standard Normal Distribution's MGF as the sample size $(n)$ heads toward infinity. Now $Z_n$ is a function of $X_n$ which we know the MGF of which is $(1-p+pe^t)^n$. Now I know that $Z_n$ is a linear transform and that we should be able to use this to simply the MGF but I don't understand how the course notes do it, mostly because they skip a lot of steps and it is difficult to follow. There is also a Taylor Series Expansion for the exponential that I am confused about although I do understand the concept of the series expansion. Help would be greatly appreciated! I would love assistant in exactly how we can prove this via MGF. Thanks so much in advance :)","Would absolutely love if someone could help me with this question, in a step by step way to help those who are uninitiated to Statistics and Mathematics.

92,Statistics Question,Statistics Question,,"This is probably super simple to most of you on here, but I was chatted by a friend earlier with a question.  It reads just like this: A sample of n =7 scores has a mean of M =5. After one new score is added to the sample,  the new mean is found to be M =6. What is the value of the new score? (Hint: Compare the values for E X before and after the score was added.) She said the E X looks like the greek symbols.  Can someone please explain this problem to me and provide a solution or tell me how to solve it?  I guess I don't understand the question or how to set up an equation to solve it.
