My try: It's clear that $|A(R)| \leq \pi R^2$ (ish). Since $\mathbb{Z}_R \times \{1\} \subset A(R)$ we can also say $A(R) \geq R$ (ish). I think we can write a formula similar to $$|A(R)| = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k \leq R} \phi(\lfloor \sqrt{k^2-R^2} \rfloor),$$ but I'm pretty sure the above is wrong. Even if it was correct, I don't have any idea how to estimate it. It also occurs to me that if $F(n)$ is the number of ways to represent $n=a^2+b^2$ with $\gcd(a,b) = 1$, then  $$A(R) = \sum_{k \leq R^2} F(k).$$ If I recall $F(n)$ is exactly known. I think  $$F \left(a^2 \prod_{i=1}^m q_i \prod_{i=1}^n p_i \right) = 2^n$$ where $n/a^2$ is square free, $q_i = 3 \mod 4$ and $p_i = 1 \mod 4$.

97,Möbius inversion,Möbius inversion,,"The Möbius inversion formula says given two arithmetic functions $\hat{g}(k)$ and $g(k)$ related by $$\sum_{d\mid k}\hat{g}(d)=g(k)$$ Then $$\sum_{d\mid k}\mu(d)g\left(\frac{k}{d}\right)=\hat{g}(k)$$ Can someone give me a very elementary proof of this? I don't know anything about analytic number theory, though I know the definition of the Möbius function, and have used it before with out ever reading to deeply into it for example: I know that, $\frac{x}{1-x}=x+x^2+x^3+x^4+\cdots$ And that if I subtract the even powers I get, $\frac{x}{1-x}-\frac{x^2}{1-x^2}=x+x^3+x^5+x^7+x^9+\cdots$ And then If I subtract the the powers that are multiples of 3 I get, $\frac{x}{1-x}-\frac{x^2}{1-x^2}-(\frac{x^3}{1-x^3}-\frac{x^6}{1-x^6})=x+x^5+x^7+x^{11}+\cdots$ Continuing in this matter one sees we are essentially yielding combinations of the original sum where the argument is a combination of distinct primes, and the coefficients are determined by weather or not the number of primes is even or odd. So by the definition of the Möbius function I can easily see, $\sum_{k=1}^\infty\frac{\mu(k)x^k}{1-x^k}=x$, although the first theorem I mentioned doesn't seem so obvious to me, and so I would appreciate a simple proof.","The Möbius inversion formula says given two arithmetic functions $\hat{g}(k)$ and $g(k)$ related by $$\sum_{d\mid k}\hat{g}(d)=g(k)$$ Then $$\sum_{d\mid k}\mu(d)g\left(\frac{k}{d}\right)=\hat{g}(k)$$ Can someone give me a very elementary proof of this?

98,"Given $a + \sqrt{b}$ with positive integer $a,b$, find $a$ and $b$?","Given  with positive integer , find  and ?","a + \sqrt{b} a,b a b","Suppose I had $n = a + \sqrt{b}$ as a decimal of arbitrary precision, but didn't know $a$ or $b$, except that they are positive integers. If I had just $\sqrt{b}$, I could just square it and end up with something very close to an integer, so I'd have $b$. If I take $n^2 - 2an$, I get $(a^2 + b + 2a\sqrt{b}) - (2a^2 + 2a\sqrt{b}) = b - a^2$ which will be an integer, but I don't have $a$... Is there some way to take the sum of the integral and decimal portion of $n$ and do some integer voodoo there? Thanks for any ideas.","Suppose I had $n = a + \sqrt{b}$ as a decimal of arbitrary precision, but didn't know $a$ or $b$, except that they are positive integers.

99,Sum of the Stieltjes constants? (divergent summation),Sum of the Stieltjes constants? (divergent summation),,"The sequence of Stieltjes-constants diverges and thus cannot be summed conventionally. However their signs oscillate (unfortunately non-periodic) and thus I tried Euler- and a version of Noerlund-summation but could not arrive at a convincing result (a first impression is that S is in the near of 0.5 , but the partial sums oscillate with any parameter that I can choose). Q1: what is a meaningful value for the divergent sum $S$ of the Stieltjes-constants? [update] Meanwhile I worked on the hints from wikipedia concerning the integral in the Borel-summation and could well make my question 2 more precise I'm trying to make something from the defining exponential generating function for the Stieltjes-constants  $$ \zeta(1+z) - {1 \over z} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k { s_k \over k! } z^k \tag1$$  or better with reversed sign of the argument z: $$ \zeta(1-z) + {1 \over z} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty { s_k \over k! } z^k \tag{1.1} $$ because the rhs looks like the inner term in the Borel-summation-method for the Stieltjes-constant, where the integral-term was cancelled. So we might, with wikipedia, say, that  $ \zeta(1-z)+{1 \over z}$ is the Borel-transform of my wished sum $ S = \sum_{k=0}^\infty s_k $ So I think, that the correct Borel-sum computation using that $\zeta$-expression is by $$ S = \int_0^\infty \exp(-t) (\zeta(1-tz)+{1\over tz}) dt | _{z=1} \tag2 $$ Feeding this into Pari/GP the integral seems to diverge; we can go to 12 or 13 for the upper bound of the integral to arrive at about S~0.499074922658 but increasing that upper bound further then the numerical integration ""begins to diverge"" (I got the same value using another method for summation, but again only as partial sum, after which the summation-procedure ""begins to diverge"") So this would indicate, that the Borel-summation is not sufficient for this, but possibly the value 0.499074... is a legitimate approximation. It seems, that the alternating sum $A$ can much easier be evaluated to $$ A = \sum_{k=0}^\infty  (-1)^k s_k \overset{ \text{ Eulersum}}{=}0.639... \tag3 $$ but this seems not to help yet for the evaluation of the non-alternating series...
