35,Proof of Comparability Theorem for well-ordered sets using transfinite recursion,Proof of Comparability Theorem for well-ordered sets using transfinite recursion,,"I am reading through Halmos's ""Naive Set Theory"". In Section 18, Halmos uses transfite recursion to prove the Comparability Thereom for well-ordered sets: The assertion is that if $\langle X, \leqslant_X \rangle$ and $\langle Y, \leqslant_Y \rangle$ are well ordered sets, then either $X$ and $Y$ are similar, or one of them is similar to an initial segment of the other. We assume that $X$ and $Y$ are non-empty well ordered sets such that neither is similar to an initial segment of the other; we proceed to prove that under these circumstances $X$ must be similar to $Y$ . Suppose that $a \in X$ and that $t$ is a sequence of type $a$ in $Y$ ; in other words $t$ is a function from $s(a)$ into $Y$ . Let $f(t)$ be the least of the proper upper bounds of the range of $t$ in $Y$ , if there are any; in the contrary case, let $f(t)$ be the least element of $Y$ . In the terminology of the transfinite recursion theorem, the function $f$ thereby determined is a sequence function of type $X$ in $Y$ . Let $U$ be the function that the transfinite recursion theorem associates with this situation. An easy argument (by transfinite induction) shows that, for each $a \in X$ , the function $U$ maps the initial segment determined by $a$ in $X$ one-to-one onto the initial segment determined by $U(a)$ in $Y$ . This implies $U$ is a similarity, and the proof is complete. I think I understand the proof up until this step: An easy argument (by transfinite induction) shows that, for each $a   \in X$ , the function $U$ maps the initial segment determined by $a$ in $X$ one-to- one onto the initial segment determined by $U(a)$ in $Y$ . This implies $U$ is a similarity, and the proof is complete. I can't seem to get my head around this ""easy transfinite induction"". I think I get what I am meant to do. Let $S$ be the set such that $a \in S$ if and only if there exists a bijection between $s(a)$ and $s(U(a))$ . We need to prove that if $s(b) \subseteq S$ , then $b \in S$ . This would imply that $S = X$ by the transfinite induction principle. I assume I need to construct a bijection from $s(b)$ to $s(U(b))$ using the bijections for each $a < b$ , but I am unsure of how to proceed with this. Note that Halmos has not introduced the concept of ordinal numbers at this point in the book, only well-ordered sets. As a result, I'd appreciate any help which avoids the use of ""ordinal terminology"". There has been a question on the site that has asked about this before but I couldn't really make sense of the answers and comments. EDIT: At the suggestion of the comments I decided to work through the following example: $$ X = a > b > c > d \\ Y = e > f > g > h $$ Then starting at $a$ we have $$ U(a) = e \\ U(b) = f \\ U(c) = g \\ U(d) = h \\  $$ I kind of understand how the proof works in these kind of instances as each element has an immediate predecessor. In this case, we can use the following argument. Any $x \in X$ has an immediate predecessor, say $x^{\prime}$ (apart from base case that is easy). So we must have $s(x) - \{x^{\prime}\} = s(x^{\prime})$ . We construct an isomorphism by taking the isomorphism we know exists from $s(x^{\prime})$ to $s(U(x^{\prime}))$ and simply add the pair $(x^{\prime}, U(x^{\prime}))$ . However, I don't really understand what to do when an element of $X$ does not have an immediate predecessor. For example consider the set of positive integers $X$ , where every odd is greater than every even. Then consider the set $Y$ of positive integers where every even is greater than every odd. In both sets order the odds with respect to each other as normal, and the evens with respect to each other as normal. So we have $$ X = 2 < 4 < 6 < \dots < 1000< 1002 < \dots < 1 < 3 < \dots \\ Y = 1 < 3 < 5 < \dots < 1001 < 1003 < \dots < 2 < 4 < \dots  $$ How does transfinite recursion deal with the case where $b = 1$ as $1$ has no immediate predecessor? EDIT: I think I understand the proof now. Either: i) $b$ has an immediate predecessor $c$ in $s(b)$ . In which case, all $a \in s(b) - \{c\}$ are mapped one-to-one into $U|_{s(c)}$ and thus $U|_{s(b)}$ . By definition of $U$ , $U(c) < U(b)$ and $U(c) > U(a)$ for all $a \in  s(b) - \{c\}$ , thus $U(c) \in s(U(b)$ and $U(c) \neq U(a)$ for all $a \in s(c)$ . Hence $U|_{s(b)}$ is an injection into $s(U(b))$ . Assume for the sake of contradiction that $U|_{s(b)}$ is not onto. Then there exists some $y$ such that $U(c) < y < U(b)$ . However, then $U(b)$ would not be the least upper bound of $U|_{s(b)}$ , thus we have a contradiction and no such $y$ can exist. So $U|_{s(b)}$ must map onto $s(U(b))$ . Hence $U|_{s(b)}$ is a surjection and an injection and thus a bijection onto $s(U(b))$ as desired. ii) $b$ has no immediate predecessor in $s(b)$ . Then for every $a \in s(b)$ there exists another $c \in s(b)$ such that $a \in s(c)$ . Observe that we can write $U|_{s(b)}$ as $\bigcup_{a \in s(b)}U|_{s(a)}$ , and hence $U|_{s(b)}$ is an injection. Next we prove that $s(U(b))$ is in the range of $U|_{s(b)}$ . For the sake of contradiction assume there is $y \in s(U(b))$ such that $y$ is not in the range of $U|_{s(b)}$ . Then there are three cases that can occur: $y$ is the least element in $s(U(b))$ . Let $x$ be the least element in $X$ . By definition of $U$ we must have $U(x) = y$ . Hence $y$ is in the range of $U|_{s(b)}$ for all $b \neq x$ . Since $U|_{s(x)} = \{\}$ , this implies case (1) cant occur. There are elements $a$ and $c$ in the range of $U|_{s(b)}$ such that $a < y < c$ . However this would imply $y$ is not in the range of $U|_{s(c)}$ , a contradiction. Thus case (2) can't occur. $a < y$ for  all $a \in s(U(b))$ . In this case $U(b)$ is not the least upper bound of $U|_{s(b)}$ , a contradiction by the definition of $U$ . Thus case (3) can't occur. So in all cases, we have a contradiction and thus $s(U(b))$ must lie in the range of $U|_{s(b)}$ . Lastly we observe that the range of $U|_{s(b)}$ lies in $s(U(b))$ . If it didn't then $U(b)$ would not be an upper bound for $U|_{s(b)}$ . Thus we conclude that $U|_{s(b)}$ is a surjection onto $s(U(b))$ . Thus as $U|_{(s(b)}$ is surjective and injective, it is bijection onto $s(U(b))$ as desired. Thus for both cases $(i)$ and $(ii)$ the result holds and we are done. EDIT: This is answer to a question in the comments below posed by jsmith: How does the definition of U imply that U(c) < U(b) By definition $U(a) = f(U^{a})$ so either: $\text{range}(U^{a}) < U(a)$ or $f(U^{a})$ is the least element of $Y$ . In the first case, the result follows trivially. We can show that the second case causes a contradiction. More specifically, if the second case occurs then the range of $U^{a}$ has no upper bound and must contain a maximal element of $Y$ . As a result, $Y$ must be similar to an initial segment of $X$ , which we assumed was not the case.

38,Proof that $\mathbb{R}^2 \cong \mathbb{R}$,Proof that,\mathbb{R}^2 \cong \mathbb{R},"I'm trying to prove that $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}$ have the same cardinality. Here is my attempt. I will be taking the Schröder-Bernstein theorem for granted. Define the map $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^2$ sending $x \longmapsto (x,0)$ . I claim that $f$ is an injection. Indeed, if $f(x) = f(y)$ for $x,y \in \mathbb{R}$ , then $(x,0) = (y,0)$ , so $x = y$ . Therefore, $|\mathbb{R}| \leq |\mathbb{R}^2|$ . By the Schröder-Bernstein theorem, it suffices to prove that $|\mathbb{R}^2| = |\mathbb{R}|$ . Lemmma 1 : $\mathbb{R} \cong (0,1)$ . Proof of Lemma 1. Notice that $\tan(x)$ is a bijection from $\left(-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}\right) \to \mathbb{R}$ since $\tan$ has period $\pi$ ; furthermore, the existence of the $\arctan$ function guarantees that the function is surjective, hence bijective. Notice that there is a one-to-one correspondence $\left(0,1\right) \to \left(- \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}\right)$ sending $x \longmapsto \left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right)\pi$ . Composing bijections gives a bijection $\left(0,1\right) \to \mathbb{R}$ . Lemma 2 : Given sets $A, B, C,D$ such that $A \cong C$ and $B \cong D$ , we have $A \times B \cong  C \times D$ . Proof of Lemma 2. Since $A \cong C$ and $B \cong D$ , there exist bijections $f: A \stackrel{\sim}{\to} C$ and $g: B \stackrel{\sim}{\to} D$ . Then define the map $$  h: \underset{(a,b)}{A \times B} \underset{\longmapsto}{\to} \underset{(f(a), g(b))}{C \times D}. $$ Given $(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2) \in A \times B$ for which $h(a_1, b_1) = h(a_2, b_2)$ , we have $(f(a_1), g(b_1)) = (f(a_2), g(b_2))$ . So $f(a_1) = f(a_2)$ and $g(b_1) = g(b_2)$ . The former implies $a_1 = a_2$ by injectivity of $f$ , while the latter implies $b_1 = b_2$ by injectivity of $g$ . So $(a_1, b_1) = (a_2, b_2)$ , so $h$ is injective. Given $(c,d) \times C \times D$ , by surjectivity of $f$ , there exists $a \in A$ such that $f(a) = c$ ; by surjectivity of $g$ , there exists $b \in B$ such that $g(b) = d$ . We then have $$  (c,d) = (f(a), g(b)) = h(a,b), $$ so $h$ is surjective, hence bijective, so $A \times B \cong C \times D$ . Corollary. It suffices to prove that $(0,1) \times (0,1) \cong (0,1)$ . Proof. We know $\mathbb{R} \cong (0,1)$ by Lemma 1. By Lemma 2, that implies that $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \cong (0,1) \times (0,1)$ . So if we prove $(0,1) \times (0,1) \cong (0,1)$ , we have $$  \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \cong (0,1) \times (0,1) \cong (0,1) \cong \mathbb{R}, $$ which is the intended result. Claim. $(0,1) \times (0,1) \cong (0,1)$ . Proof of Claim. We use the Schröder-Bernstein theorem. There is an obvious injection $(0,1) \times (0,1) \times (0,1)$ sending $x \longmapsto \left(x, \frac{1}{2}\right)$ . This is an injection regardless of whether we allow an infinite string of $9$ 's. Concordantly, we can define an injection $(0,1) \times (0,1) \to (0,1)$ as follows. Given $(x,y) \in (0,1) \times (0,1)$ , choose a decimal expansion for $x,y \in (0,1)$ that does not contain an infinite string of nines, which we know to be unique. Write $$  x = 0.x_1 x_2 x_3 \ldots \\ y = 0.y_1 y_2 y_3 \ldots  $$ Then define $$  f(x,y) = 0.x_1 y_1 x_2 y_2 x_3 y_3 \ldots  $$ Since neither $x,y$ contained an infinite string of nines, $f(x,y)$ likewise does not. I claim that $f$ is an injection. Indeed, suppose that $f(a,b) = f(c,d)$ for $(a,b), (c,d) \in (0,1) \times (0,1)$ . Defining the decimal expansions for $a,b,c,d$ similarly, we then have $$  0.a_1 b_1 a_2 b_2 a_3 b_3 \ldots = 0.c_1 d_1 c_2 d_2 c_3 d_4 \ldots. $$ Since neither of these expressions contain an infinite string of $9$ 's, we can equate corresponding digits, so $a_i = c_i$ for all $i \geq 1$ and $b_i = d_i$ for all $i \geq i$ , so $a = c$ and $b = d$ , so $(a,b) = (c,d)$ , so $f$ is injective. By the Shroder-Bernstein theorem, $(0,1) \times (0,1) \cong (0,1)$ . -- How does this proof look? The only fact I am not totally sure I understand fully is why the decimal expansion not terminating in a string of nine's is unique.

47,Why Cantor's diagonal proof applies to real but not to natural numbers (specific reason for repost),Why Cantor's diagonal proof applies to real but not to natural numbers (specific reason for repost),,"I am aware that a very similar question was asked here before, but I still fail to understand the exact reason why Cantor's argument is applicable in one case and not in the other. In order to clarify my point, I wish to present two parallel attempted proofs - one more or less equivalent to Cantor's own (proving that the real numbers can't be listed) and one that will attempt to prove by an equivalent method that the natural numbers can't be listed/counted (which of  course would make no sense if true). Could you please help me better understand Cantor's argument by telling me at which step my attempted parallel breaks down? I am not a mathematician - just someone trying to make sense of how infinite sets work. Step 1 - Cantor's Argument-CA): Let the number of members (cardinality) of the infinite set of Natural numbers be defined as aleph-0. Let any infinite set that is bijective with the set of Natural numbers be called countably infinite/listable. Step 1 - Parallel Argument-PA): Let the infinite set of Countable Numbers (C) be defined as follows {1*, 2*, 3*, 4*, 5*...}. (I am aware this is not a very formal definition, but I think it should be possible to formally and independently define an infinite set that is equivalent to the set of natural numbers). Let the number of members (cardinality) of the set of Countable numbers be defined as aleph-0. Let any infinite set that is bijective with the set of Countable numbers be called countably infinite/listable. Step 2 - Cantor's Argument): Let M be defined as the list of all infinite two-bit sequences. Let L denote a subset of M, constructed as an unbounded list of its members Li: L1, L2, L3 etc. Match each member of L with a member of N (Natural Numbers). The result would be something like: L1 - 10111101110110001... L2 - 0010110011101010... L3 - 1001011010101010... ...(it is not necessary for the list to be complete) Step 2 - Parallel Argument) Let N be defined as the list of all finite two-bit sequences starting with 1. Let K denote a subset of N, constructed as an unbounded list of its members Ki: K1, K2, K3 etc. Match each member of K with a  member of C (Countable Numbers). The result would be something like: -1* - K1 - 1 -2* - K2 - 10 -3* - K3 - 100010 -4* - K4 - 1000 -5* - K5 - 11101 -...(it is not necessary for the list to be complete) Step 3 - Cantor's Argument) For any number x of already constructed Li, we can construct a L0 that is different from L1, L2, L3...Lx, yet that by definition belongs to M. For this, we use the diagonalization technique: we invert the first member of L1 to get the first member of L0, then we invert the second member of L2 to get the second member of L0 and so on. In our case L0 = 011... -L0 belongs to M -L0 does not belong to L={L1, L2, L3...Lx} for any x. It follows that: L={L1, L2, L3...Lx} for any x cannot be M. Given that L1, L2, L3... was each matched to a Natural number, it follows that there are more members of M than members of the Natural number set, therefore the set M is not countably  infinite. It is possible to show that the set of real numbers is bijective with M, therefore the set of Real numbers is also not countably infinite. Step 3 - Parallel Argument) For any number x of already constructed Ki, we can construct a K0 that is different from K1, K2, K3...Kx, yet that by definition belongs to N. For that we use the copying and addition technique: going over the list sequentially, we copy the digits of each Kr (r=1 to x) into the corresponding digits of K0, always overwriting existing entries. After that we add one additional {0} at the end. In our case we get K0=111010...0. -K0 belongs to N -K0 does not belong to K={K1, K2, K3...Kx} for any x. It follows that: K={K1, K2, K3...Kx} for any x cannot be N. Given that K1, K2, K3... was each matched to a Counting number, it follows that there are more members of N than members of the Counting number set, therefore the set N is not countably infinite.

Concluding remark: My problem with Cantor's argument is that the second premise in the syllogism in step 3 seems to fail because that premise seems to presuppose under L both an actually infinite list, and a constructed list {L1, L2, L3...Lx} which is by definition finite.

Which would explain why, in my exposition, the argument paradoxically ""works"" for natural numbers as well. I am sure I am misconstruing something though and I will be grateful for your corrections. Thank you.","I am aware that a very similar question was asked here before, but I still fail to understand the exact reason why Cantor's argument is applicable in one case and not in the other. In order to clarify my point, I wish to present two parallel attempted proofs - one more or less equivalent to Cantor's own (proving that the real numbers can't be listed) and one that will attempt to prove by an equivalent method that the natural numbers can't be listed/counted (which of  course would make no sense if true). Could you please help me better understand Cantor's argument by telling me at which step my attempted parallel breaks down? I am not a mathematician - just someone trying to make sense of how infinite sets work. Step 1 - Cantor's Argument-CA): Let the number of members (cardinality) of the infinite set of Natural numbers be defined as aleph-0. Let any infinite set that is bijective with the set of Natural numbers be called countably infinite/listable. Step 1 - Parallel Argument-PA): Let the infinite set of Countable Numbers (C) be defined as follows {1*, 2*, 3*, 4*, 5*...}. (I am aware this is not a very formal definition, but I think it should be possible to formally and independently define an infinite set that is equivalent to the set of natural numbers). Let the number of members (cardinality) of the set of Countable numbers be defined as aleph-0. Let any infinite set that is bijective with the set of Countable numbers be called countably infinite/listable. Step 2 - Cantor's Argument): Let M be defined as the list of all infinite two-bit sequences. Let L denote a subset of M, constructed as an unbounded list of its members Li: L1, L2, L3 etc. Match each member of L with a member of N (Natural Numbers). The result would be something like: L1 - 10111101110110001... L2 - 0010110011101010... L3 - 1001011010101010... ...(it is not necessary for the list to be complete) Step 2 - Parallel Argument) Let N be defined as the list of all finite two-bit sequences starting with 1. Let K denote a subset of N, constructed as an unbounded list of its members Ki: K1, K2, K3 etc. Match each member of K with a  member of C (Countable Numbers). The result would be something like: -1* - K1 - 1 -2* - K2 - 10 -3* - K3 - 100010 -4* - K4 - 1000 -5* - K5 - 11101 -...(it is not necessary for the list to be complete) Step 3 - Cantor's Argument) For any number x of already constructed Li, we can construct a L0 that is different from L1, L2, L3...Lx, yet that by definition belongs to M. For this, we use the diagonalization technique: we invert the first member of L1 to get the first member of L0, then we invert the second member of L2 to get the second member of L0 and so on. In our case L0 = 011... -L0 belongs to M -L0 does not belong to L={L1, L2, L3...Lx} for any x. It follows that: L={L1, L2, L3...Lx} for any x cannot be M. Given that L1, L2, L3... was each matched to a Natural number, it follows that there are more members of M than members of the Natural number set, therefore the set M is not countably  infinite. It is possible to show that the set of real numbers is bijective with M, therefore the set of Real numbers is also not countably infinite. Step 3 - Parallel Argument) For any number x of already constructed Ki, we can construct a K0 that is different from K1, K2, K3...Kx, yet that by definition belongs to N. For that we use the copying and addition technique: going over the list sequentially, we copy the digits of each Kr (r=1 to x) into the corresponding digits of K0, always overwriting existing entries. After that we add one additional {0} at the end. In our case we get K0=111010...0. -K0 belongs to N -K0 does not belong to K={K1, K2, K3...Kx} for any x. It follows that: K={K1, K2, K3...Kx} for any x cannot be N. Given that K1, K2, K3... was each matched to a Counting number, it follows that there are more members of N than members of the Counting number set, therefore the set N is not countably infinite. It is possible to show that the set of Natural numbers is bijective with N, therefore the set of Natural numbers is also not countably infinite.

By Axiom of Choice, there is a choice function $f:\mathcal{P}(A) \setminus \{\emptyset\} \to A$ such that $f(X) \in X$ for all $X \in \mathcal{P}(A) \setminus \{\emptyset\}$ . Let $V$ be the class of all sets. We define a function $G:V \to V$ as follows: $$G(x)=\begin{cases} f(A \setminus {\rm ran} (x))&\text{if }x\text{ is a function and }A \setminus {\rm ran} (x) \neq \emptyset\\A&\text{otherwise}\end{cases}$$ By Transfinite Recursion Theorem, there is a function $F: {\rm Ord} \to V$ such that $F(\alpha)=G(F \restriction \alpha)$ for all $\alpha \in {\rm Ord}$ .

Both cases lead to a contradiction. $A=F(\lambda)$ for some $\lambda < h(A)$ where $h(A)$ is the Hartogs number of $A$ If not, $A \neq F(\lambda)$ for all $\lambda < h(A)$ and consequently $F(\lambda) \in A$ for all $\lambda < h(A)$ . Then $F \restriction h(A)$ is an injection from $h(A)$ to $A$ and thus $|h(A)| \le |A|$ . This contradicts the definition of $h(A)$ . $A={\rm ran} (F \restriction \beta)$ for some $\beta \in {\rm Ord}$ Let $\beta = \min \{\lambda \in {\rm Ord} \mid A=F(\lambda)\}$ . Then $F(\alpha) \in A$ for all $\alpha<\beta$ . If not, $F(\alpha) = A$ for some $\alpha<\beta$ . This contradicts the minimality of $\beta$ . It follows that ${\rm ran} (F \restriction \beta) \subseteq A$ . Moreover, $F(\beta)=A \implies G(F \restriction \beta)=A \implies A \setminus {\rm ran} (F \restriction \beta) =\emptyset \implies A \subseteq {\rm ran} (F \restriction \beta)$ . To sum up, ${\rm ran} (F \restriction \beta) = A$ . Hence $F \restriction \beta$ is a bijection from $\beta$ to $A$ .

Let a   recursive rule be given, that is, a mapping $F$ whose arguments are an   element $x \in A$ and a function $g: [\bot, x) \to B$, and whose value   is an element of $B$.

This is proved by transfinite induction on $x$, thus: if $f(w) \subseteq \ham(f) \cap [\bot, w]$ for all $w < x$, then $f(x-) \subseteq \ham(f) \cap [\bot, x)$, and so $f(x) \subseteq \ham(f) \cap [\bot, x]$.

For simplicity, we will use a small set to work with, say $\{a, b, c\}$. First, the definitions. A binary relation (we'll call it $R$) is reflexive if $(x, x) \in R$. And a relation is transitive if $(x , y)\in R$ and $(y, z) \in R$ implies that $(x, z) \in R$. So an example of a reflexive relation that is not transitive on $\{a,b,c\}$ would be the following relation: $$\{(a,a),(b,b),(c,c), (a,b), (b,c)\}$$ Note that every element is in relation to itself, so it is reflexive. However, it is not transitive, because although $a$ is in relation with $ b$ and $b$ is in relation to $c$, $a$ is not in relation $c$.

For example, the identity function $f : \{0\} \rightarrow \{0\}$ is surjective and can be identified with its graph: $f = \{ (0,0) \} \in \{0\} \times \{0\}$. However, this is also the graph of the non-surjective function $f : \{0\} \rightarrow \mathbb R$. It seems intuitive to me the ""same"" function with different codomains is actually different functions. Consequently, the codomain should be included as information when we define a ""function object"" in mathematics.",,"['elementary-set-theory', 'foundations']"

Firstly, let me note that the axioms in the book preceding the study of the natural numbers are the axiom of extensionality, the empty set axiom, pairing, unions, power sets and the axiom for constructing subsets. At the beginning of Chapter 4 is given the definition of the successor $a^{+}=a \cup \{a\}$ of a set $a$.  Enderton then defines $0=\emptyset$, $1=0^{+}$, $2=1^{+}$ and so on. A set $a$ is called inductive if $\emptyset \in A$ and $a \in A \implies a^{+} \in A$.  The axiom of infinity then asserts the existence of an inductive set, and the set of natural numbers $\omega$ is defined to be the intersection of all inductive sets.  The existence of this set follows from the axioms mentioned. Now clearly each set $0,1,2 \ldots$ belongs to the set $\omega$ since it contains $0=\emptyset$ and is closed under successors.
