46,Is there a faster way to factor $X^{12}-1$ over $\mathbb{F}_5[X]$?,Is there a faster way to factor  over ?,X^{12}-1 \mathbb{F}_5[X],"Problem: Factor $X^{12}-1$ into irreducibles in $\mathbb{F}_5[X]$.  This problem appeared on a past qual and took me awhile to do.  While I solved it, I'll need to be able to do problems like this a lot faster to have a chance of passing.  At the very least, I was wondering whether there was a quick way to tell that $X^4-X^2+1$ is not irreducible in $\mathbb{F}_5[X]$. My solution: I first factored this polynomial over $\mathbb{Z}[X]$, as $$(X-1)(X+1)(X^2+X+1)(X^2+1)(X^2-X+1)(X^4-X^2+1)$$ via the formula $X^n-1 = \prod\limits_{d \mid n} \Phi_d(X)$, where $\Phi_d$ is the $d$th cyclotomic polynomial.  The first $5$ irreducibles can easily be checked to remain irreducible when going modulo $5$ (by checking if they have a root), so the hard part of the problem is checking whether the $12$th cyclotomic polynomial, $X^4-X^2+1$, remains irreducible in $\mathbb{F}_5[X]$. It's easy to see that $\Phi_{12}$ has no roots in $\mathbb{F}_5$, so it would have to be a product of two quadratics.  I supposed it did factor, as $$X^4-X^2+1 = (X^2 + aX+b)(X^2+cX+d)$$ I expanded the right hand side as $X^4 + (a+c)X^3 + (b+ac+d)X^2 + (bc+ad)X + bd$, so I had the relations (i): $a+c = 0$ (ii) $b+ac+d =-1$ (iii) $bc+ad=0$ (iv) $bd = 1$. I began by considering the case where $a \neq 0$ (I had already checked that $\Phi_{12}$ couldn't factor as a product $(X^2 +e)(X^2+f)$), so that also $c \neq 0$.  I multiplied (iii) by $d$ to get $c+ad^2 = 0$, and subtracted (i) from this to get $ad^2-a = 0$, or $d^2 = 1$. So $d = \pm 1$.  First I supposed $d = 1$, so that also $b=1$.  Then $a, c$ were nonzero elements satisfying $a+c = 0$ and $ac + 2 = -1$, or $ac = 2$. For $ac = 2$ we can only have $\{a,c\} = \{3,4\}$ or $\{a,c\} = \{1,2\}$, and in neither of those cases could we have $a+c = 0$. Next I supposed $d = -1$, so that also $b = -1$.  Then $a, c$ were nonzero elements satisfying $ac=1$ and $a+c = 0$.  This relation is satisfied by $a = 2, b = 3$.  So I looked at the product $$(X^2+2x-1)(X^2+3X-1)$$ which expands as $X^4+5X^3+4X^2-5X+1$, which is $X^4-X^2+1$ in $\mathbb{F}_5[X]$.","Problem: Factor $X^{12}-1$ into irreducibles in $\mathbb{F}_5[X]$.

58,Is there an algebraic-geometric solution to the problem of the Leibnizian formalism?,Is there an algebraic-geometric solution to the problem of the Leibnizian formalism?,,"The precise question appears at the end of this entry. With all the recent advances in understanding infinitesimals, we still don't fully understand why Leibniz's definition of $\frac{dy}{dx}$ as literally a ratio works the way it does and seems to explain numerous facts including chain rule. Note that Robinson modified Leibniz's approach as follows. Suppose we have a function $y=f(x)$. Let $\Delta x$ be an infinitesimal hyperreal $x$-increment. Consider the corresponding $y$-increment $\Delta y=f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)$. The ratio of hyperreals $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$ is not quite the derivative. Rather, we must round off the ratio to the nearest real number (its standard part ) and so we set $f'(x)=\text{st}\big(\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\big)$. To be consistent with the traditional Leibnizian notation one then defines new variables $dx=\Delta x$ and $dy=f'(x)dx$ so as to get $f'(x)=\frac{dy}{dx}$ but of course here $dy$ is not the $y$-increment corresponding to the $x$-increment. Thus the Leibnizian notation is not made fully operational. Leibniz himself handled the problem (of which he was certainly aware, contrary to Bishop Berkeley's allegations) by explaining that he was working with a more general relation of equality ""up to"" negligible terms, in a suitable sense to be determined. Thus if $y=x^2$ then the equality sign in $\frac{dy}{dx}=2x$ does not mean, to Leibniz, exactly what we think it means. Another approach to $dy=f'(x)dx$ is smooth infinitesimal analysis where infinitesimals are nilsquare so you get equality on the nose though you can't form the ratio. On the other hand, Leibniz worked with arbitrary nonzero orders of infinitesimals $dx^n$ so this doesn't fully capture the Leibnizian framework either. Question: In an algebraic-geometric or other algebraic or analytic context (with suitable limitations on $f$), is there a way of assigning a precise sense to the Leibnizian generalized equality using global considerations?

Also, the function $t^3-x^3y$ gets sent to $(uv)^3-v^3u^3=0$, which is silly because what I was planning in order to get $\tilde A$ was to divide out $\mathbb C[u,v,z]$ by the image of $t^3-x^3y$. Probably none of this makes sense, but at least you can see where my difficulties are. Thank you!",,"['abstract-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra', 'integral-domain']"

(Write each in the form $\Bbb{Q}(\alpha)$ for some specific $\alpha \in F$ .) c) For each intermediate field $E$ above, give the Galois group of $E$ over $\Bbb{Q}$ . a) Since $\Bbb{Q}(\zeta_9)$ is the splitting field of a cyclotomic polynomial, $Gal(F/\Bbb{Q})=\Bbb{Z}^{\times}_9$ . b) Since $Gal(F/\Bbb{Q})=\Bbb{Z}^{\times}_9$ , we need to find the subgroups of $\Bbb{Z}^{\times}_9$ . But $|\Bbb{Z}^{\times}_9|=6$ and there are only 2 groups of order 6 up to isomorphism: $\Bbb{Z}_6$ and $D_6$ . Since $\Bbb{Z}^{\times}_9$ is abelian, we know that $\Bbb{Z}^{\times}_9 \cong \Bbb{Z}_6$ . So we can use either of these diagrams, since they are both isomorphic or Where $\langle 4 \rangle = \{1, 4, 7\}$ and $\langle 8 \rangle \{1, 8\}$ . So the corresponding diagram for the intermediate fields is We need to find $\alpha$ and $\beta$ , where $[\Bbb{Q}(\alpha):\Bbb{Q}]=2$ and $[\Bbb{Q}(\beta):\Bbb{Q}]=3$ . We know that $(\zeta^3_9)^3 = 1 \implies (\zeta^3_9)^9-1=0$ . So the minimal polynomial of $\zeta^3_9$ divides $x^3-1$ . We know that $x^3-1=\Phi_1(x)\Phi_3(x)=(x-1)(x^2+x+1)$ , where $\Phi_k(x)$ is the kth cyclotomic polynomial. Since $1 \in \Bbb{Q}$ , we only need to check if $x^2+x+1$ is reducible over $\Bbb{Q}$ . But since it is a cyclotomic polynomial, it must be. So the minimal polynomial of $\zeta_9^3$ over $\Bbb{Q}$ has degree $2 \implies \alpha=\zeta^3_9$ . Now we need to find $\beta$ . Using Gerry Myerson's answer , we choose $\zeta_9 \in \Bbb{Q}(\zeta_9)$ . Since we are looking at a the Galois group of degree $3$ , we need to find a $\sigma$ such that $\sigma^3(\zeta_9  )=\zeta_9$ . So we can choose $\sigma(\zeta_9)=\zeta_9^4$ . Now we need to find the minimal polynomial of $\zeta_9 + \zeta_9^4 + \zeta_9^7$ . We see that $$(\zeta_9 + \zeta_9^4 + \zeta_9^7)^3 = 9\zeta_9^3 + 9\zeta_9^6 + 9$$ But $$\cos(6\pi/9) + i\sin(6\pi/9) + \cos(12\pi/9) + i\sin(12\pi/9)$$ $$= 2\cos(6\pi/9) = 2\cos(2\pi/3)=2(-1/2) = -1$$ since $2\pi6/9 - 2\pi = -6\pi/9$ . It follows that $(\zeta_9 + \zeta_9^4 + \zeta_9^7)^3 = 9(-1+1)=0$ . So we know that the min polynomial for $\zeta_9 + \zeta_9^4 + \zeta_9^7$ must divide $x^3$ . So we need to check if $(\zeta_9 + \zeta_9^4 + \zeta_9^7)^2=0$ . We see that $(\zeta_9 + \zeta_9^4 + \zeta_9^7)^2 = 3\zeta_2^7 + 3\zeta_9^5 + 3\zeta_9^8$ . But we can see from the unit circle, that the sum of the three vectors ends up $50^{\circ}$ above the horizontal axis; so it is not zero $\implies$ the minimal polynomial for $\zeta_9 + \zeta_9^4 + \zeta_9^7$ is of degree $3$ $\implies$ $\zeta_9 + \zeta_9^4 + \zeta_9^7$ is a possible choice for $\beta$ . c) The Galois group of $\Bbb{Q}(\alpha)$ is isomorphic to $\Bbb{Z}_3$ , and that of $\Bbb{Q}(\beta)$ is isomorphic to $\Bbb{Z}_2$ . I have two questions: Is my answer correct? For part b), we know that $\Bbb{Z}^{\times}_9 \cong \Bbb{Z}_6$ , so finding the lattice of the subgroups is easy.

Let $L$ be a Galois extension of $F$ containing K and let $H \leq Gal(L/F)$ be the subgroup corresponding to K. Define Norm of $\alpha\in K$ to be $\large \Pi \sigma(\alpha)$ where the product is taken over all the embeddings of K into an algebraic closure of F. Define Trace of $\alpha\in K$ to be $\large \Sigma \sigma(\alpha)$ where the product is taken over all the embeddings of K into an algebraic closure of F. First Question is to prove that $\large \Pi \sigma(\alpha) \in F$ and $\large \Sigma \sigma(\alpha) \in F$ What i suppose is that $K/F$ has to be galois, I mean if it is galois, it would be easy to see $\tau(\large \Pi \sigma(\alpha))=\large \Pi \tau\sigma(\alpha)=\large \Pi \sigma(\alpha)$ (for a fixed $\tau$,  if $\sigma$ varies over all elements of galois group, $\tau\sigma$ varies over all elements of the group).i.e., $\large \Pi \sigma(\alpha)$ is fixed by $\tau$. This holds for all $\tau\in Gal(K/F)$ thus, $\large \Pi \sigma(\alpha)$ has to be in $F$ as only elements which are fixed by all elements of $Gal(K/F)$ are elements of $F$. Thus, $\large \Pi \sigma(\alpha)$ has to be in $F$. For similar reasons, one can see that $\large \Sigma \sigma(\alpha) \in F$. So, If it is Galois, I am able to see, But, result is true in general.

First Question is to prove that $\large \Pi \sigma(\alpha) \in F$ and $\large \Sigma \sigma(\alpha) \in F$ What i suppose is that $K/F$ has to be galois, I mean if it is galois, it would be easy to see $\tau(\large \Pi \sigma(\alpha))=\large \Pi \tau\sigma(\alpha)=\large \Pi \sigma(\alpha)$ (for a fixed $\tau$,  if $\sigma$ varies over all elements of galois group, $\tau\sigma$ varies over all elements of the group).i.e., $\large \Pi \sigma(\alpha)$ is fixed by $\tau$. This holds for all $\tau\in Gal(K/F)$ thus, $\large \Pi \sigma(\alpha)$ has to be in $F$ as only elements which are fixed by all elements of $Gal(K/F)$ are elements of $F$. Thus, $\large \Pi \sigma(\alpha)$ has to be in $F$. For similar reasons, one can see that $\large \Sigma \sigma(\alpha) \in F$. So, If it is Galois, I am able to see, But, result is true in general.

89,Factorization of Ideals in Dedekind Domains Proof,Factorization of Ideals in Dedekind Domains Proof,,"I am trying to understand a proof of the following statement: Let $R$ be a Dedekind ring and let $I$ be an ideal of $R$. $I$ is contained in only a finite number of prime ideals $\mathfrak{p}_1,...,\mathfrak{p}_n$ of $R$ and $I=\mathfrak{p}_1^{a_1}\cdots \mathfrak{p}_n^{a_n}$ for some $a_1,\cdots,a_n \in\mathbb{N}^+$. The proof, which was taken from Janusz's Algebraic Number Fields and modified by me, goes as follows: Consider the ring $S=R/I$. Note that since $R$ is of Krull dimension 1, $S$ is a commutative ring in which every prime ideal is maximal. Therefore every ideal of $S$ contains a product of prime ideals. The prime ideals of $S$ correspond bijectively with the prime ideals of $R$ which contain $I$. Note that there can be only finitely many prime ideals of $S$ and hence only finitely many prime ideals $\mathfrak{p}_1,\cdots,\mathfrak{p}_n$ of $R$ which contain $I$. In particular, there exists $a_1,\cdots, a_n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $({\mathfrak{p}_1/I})^{a_1}\cdots ({\mathfrak{p}_n/I})^{a_n}=0$. This implies $\mathfrak{p}_1^{a_1}\cdots \mathfrak{p}_n^{a_n}\subseteq I$. Let $\widetilde{R}=R/\mathfrak{p}_1^{a_1}\cdots \mathfrak{p}_n^{a_n}$. Since the ideals $\mathfrak{p}_i$ and $\mathfrak{p}_j$ are maximal for all $i$ and $j$, they are comaximal for all $i\neq j$. Thus by the Chinese remainder theorem we have  $$ \widetilde{R}\cong R/{\mathfrak{p}_1}^{a_1}\times \cdots \times R/{\mathfrak{p}_n}^{a_n}. $$ The ideals of $\widetilde{R}$ are of the form $I_1\times \cdots \times I_n$, where $I_k$ is an ideal of $R/{\mathfrak{p}_k}^{a_k}$. Since the ideals of $R/\mathfrak{p}_k^{a_k}$ are all powers of $\mathfrak{p}_k/\mathfrak{p}_k^{a_k}$, the ideals of $\widetilde{R}$ are the image of some product $\mathfrak{p}_1^{b_1}\cdots \mathfrak{p}_n^{b_n}$ for some $b_i \leq a_i$.

I'm sure the reason is staring me right in the face, but I cannot see it. Question What is the reasoning behind the final step?","I am trying to understand a proof of the following statement: Let $R$ be a Dedekind ring and let $I$ be an ideal of $R$. $I$ is contained in only a finite number of prime ideals $\mathfrak{p}_1,...,\mathfrak{p}_n$ of $R$ and $I=\mathfrak{p}_1^{a_1}\cdots \mathfrak{p}_n^{a_n}$ for some $a_1,\cdots,a_n \in\mathbb{N}^+$. The proof, which was taken from Janusz's Algebraic Number Fields and modified by me, goes as follows: Consider the ring $S=R/I$. Note that since $R$ is of Krull dimension 1, $S$ is a commutative ring in which every prime ideal is maximal. Therefore every ideal of $S$ contains a product of prime ideals. The prime ideals of $S$ correspond bijectively with the prime ideals of $R$ which contain $I$. Note that there can be only finitely many prime ideals of $S$ and hence only finitely many prime ideals $\mathfrak{p}_1,\cdots,\mathfrak{p}_n$ of $R$ which contain $I$. In particular, there exists $a_1,\cdots, a_n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $({\mathfrak{p}_1/I})^{a_1}\cdots ({\mathfrak{p}_n/I})^{a_n}=0$. This implies $\mathfrak{p}_1^{a_1}\cdots \mathfrak{p}_n^{a_n}\subseteq I$. Let $\widetilde{R}=R/\mathfrak{p}_1^{a_1}\cdots \mathfrak{p}_n^{a_n}$. Since the ideals $\mathfrak{p}_i$ and $\mathfrak{p}_j$ are maximal for all $i$ and $j$, they are comaximal for all $i\neq j$. Thus by the Chinese remainder theorem we have  $$ \widetilde{R}\cong R/{\mathfrak{p}_1}^{a_1}\times \cdots \times R/{\mathfrak{p}_n}^{a_n}. $$ The ideals of $\widetilde{R}$ are of the form $I_1\times \cdots \times I_n$, where $I_k$ is an ideal of $R/{\mathfrak{p}_k}^{a_k}$. Since the ideals of $R/\mathfrak{p}_k^{a_k}$ are all powers of $\mathfrak{p}_k/\mathfrak{p}_k^{a_k}$, the ideals of $\widetilde{R}$ are the image of some product $\mathfrak{p}_1^{b_1}\cdots \mathfrak{p}_n^{b_n}$ for some $b_i \leq a_i$. In  particular, this means $I$ has the same image as some $\mathfrak{p}_1^{c_1}\cdots \mathfrak{p}_n^{c_n}$, where $c_i \leq a_i$ for all $i$. Since both $I$ and $\mathfrak{p}_1^{c_1}\cdots \mathfrak{p}_n^{c_n}$ contain $\mathfrak{p}_1^{a_1}\cdots \mathfrak{p}_n^{a_n}$ and map to the same element ideal of $\widetilde{R}$, we must have $I=\mathfrak{p}_1^{c_1}\cdots \mathfrak{p}_n^{c_n}$. $\square$ The part which I do not understand is the final step: Since both $I$ and $\mathfrak{p}_1^{c_1}\cdots \mathfrak{p}_n^{c_n}$ contain $\mathfrak{p}_1^{a_1}\cdots \mathfrak{p}_n^{a_n}$ and map to the same element ideal of $\widetilde{R}$, we must have $I=\mathfrak{p}_1^{c_1}\cdots \mathfrak{p}_n^{c_n}$.

I would appreciate some help in a part of the proof of the following question: Exercise V.3.24. An algebraic extension $F$ of $K$ is normal over $K$ if and only if for every irreducible $f\in K[x],f$ factors in $F[x]$ as a product of irreducible factors all of which have the same degree. The part I have problem with is showing $F$ is normal when all factorization is of the same degree. Here is my progress so far: Let $u\in F$ be a root of $f\in K[x]$. We need to show that $f$ splits in $F$, so that $F$ is normal. Let $g=f_K^u\in K[x]$ be the minimal polynomial of $u$. Since $f(u)=0=g(u)$, we may conclude that $g\;|\;f$. Since $f,g\in K[x]$ and $g\;|\;f$ this shows that $g=f$, since $f$ is irreducible. Therefore for all irreducible $f\in K[x]$, if it has a root in $F$, then $f$ is necessarily the minimal polynomial of some $u\in F$. Let deg $f=d$, such that $\lbrace u_1,\dots,u_r\rbrace$ are the roots in the Algebraic closure $\overline K$ of $K$. (Such that $r\leq d$, assuming some roots may have multiplicity $>1$) $u_1\in F$ by assumption, but why can we assume that $u_2,\dots,u_r\subset F$? My guess is for some $\sigma\in Aut_K\overline K$, I can have $\sigma(u_1)=u_j$ that extends to an isomorphism $K(u_1)\cong K(u_j)$, since $\sigma(f)=f$ and $\sigma(u_1)=u_j$ are both roots. Then using some restriction on $\sigma$, I should be able to show that $\sigma(u_1)\in F$. But I am not sure how to do it.
