Unfortunately, he doesn't explicitly give a definition of irreducibility for quasiprojective varieties.  Based on the definition for (closed) sets in affine space, I assumed that a quasiprojective variety $X$ is reducible if there are closed sets $Z_1, Z_2$ such that neither contains $X$ and such that  $$\left ( Z_1 \cap X \right ) \cup \left ( Z_2 \cap X \right ) = X$$  (i.e. $X$ can be written as a nontrivial union of sets that are closed with respect to $X$).

Munkres, 2nd edition: Let $X$ be a [topological] space. Then $X$ is locally compact Hausdorff if and only if there exists a [topological] space $Y$ satisfying the following conditions: (1) $X$ is a subspace of $Y$ . (2) The set $Y - X$ consists of a single point. (3) $Y$ is a compact Hausdorff space. If $Y$ and $Y^\prime$ are two [topological] spaces satisfying these conditions, then there is a homeomorphism of $Y$ with $Y^\prime$ that equals the identity map on $X$ . Following the proof of this theorem, Munkres gives this definition: If $Y$ is a compact Hausdorff space and $X$ is a proper subspace of $Y$ whose closure equals $Y$ , then $Y$ is said to be a compactification of $X$ . If $Y - X$ equals a single point, then $Y$ is called the one-point compactification of $X$ . Thus from Theorem 29.1 we can conclude the following: If $X$ is a topological space that is locally compact and Hausdorff but not compact, then $X$ has a one-point-compactification, and conversely.

PS: The map $f \colon \mathbb{R} \longrightarrow (-1, 1)$ , $$ r \mapsto \frac{ r }{ \sqrt{1 + r^2} } $$ is a homeomorphism. The derivative $f^\prime$ of $f$ is given by $$ f^\prime(r) = \frac{1}{ (1+ r^2) \sqrt{ 1+r^2 } } > 0$$ for all $r \in \mathbb{R}$ so that $f$ is strictly increasing and hence also injective. Of course, $f$ is continuous. Moreover, $$ \lim_{r \to +\infty} f(r) = +1, \ \mbox{ and } \ \lim_{r \to -\infty} f(r) = -1. $$ Thus we indeed have $$  f \big(\mathbb{R}\big) = (-1, 1).  $$ The inverse $f^{-1} \colon (-1, 1) \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is given by $$ f^{-1}(s) = \frac{s}{\sqrt{1-s^2} }, $$ which is also continuous.

However, the OP there was looking for a solution where we could assume any number of things, while I want to stick with just the given assumption (continuity). All the answers there addressed the OP's intent, making certain assumptions that might not be necessary. So none of them apply here. Here's the question: A continuous, injective curve $C$ goes from $(-1,-1)$ to $(1,1)$ in the Euclidean plane. Rotating $C$ in either direction by $90$ degrees with respect to the origin, we obtain a new curve $C'$ from $(-1,1)$ to $(1,-1)$ . Prove that there exists a point $X$ that lies on both $C$ and $C'$ . In the linked question, the accepted answer by Arthur assumes every straight line through the origin intersects $C$ at exactly one point (of course, except the  line $y=x$ ), and that $C$ goes strictly counterclockwise. Assuming these, he provides a proof. The other two answers are incomplete, each missing a case that they did not discuss. Here's an approach that seems promising. Look at $C$ as a set of points, which we represent in polar coordinates $(r,\theta)$ . There exists a point $P_0=(r_0,\theta_0)$ so that $r(P)\geq r_0$ for all $P\in C$ (by continuity), and similarly we have a upper bound with $P_1=(r_1,\theta_1)$ . If we assume that there exists precisely two points in $C$ of distance $r$ to the origin for every $r$ so that $r_0<r<r_1$ , then the difference of their $\theta$ s is uniquely determined by $r$ . Let's call this number $\theta(r)$ . Since $\theta(\sqrt2)=\pi>\pi/2$ and $\theta(r_0)=0<\pi/2$ , and $\theta$ is continuous, by IVT there is some $r$ so that $\theta(r)=\pi/2$ . So we have a point on $C$ which is exactly $90$ degrees away from another point on $C$ of the same distance to the origin. Hence, rotating this point by $90$ degrees, the result still stays on the curve. We are done. This approach still assumes more than just continuity. In particular, it is not in general true that there are exactly $2$ points of each $r$ on $C$ . If we don't assume that, this proof breaks down since $r$ does not determine $\theta$ .

Then, since $f$ is bijective, we have that  $f(V)=f(f^{-1}(U))$.

76,limsup and liminf of a sequence of subsets of a set,limsup and liminf of a sequence of subsets of a set,,"I am confused when reading Wikipedia's article on limsup and liminf of a sequence of subsets of a set $X$ . It says there are two different ways to define them, but first gives what is common for the two .  Quoted: There are two common ways to define   the limit of sequences of set. In both   cases: The sequence accumulates around sets   of points rather than single points   themselves. That is, because each   element of the sequence is itself a   set, there exist accumulation sets that are somehow nearby to infinitely   many elements of the sequence. The supremum/superior/outer limit is a   set that joins these accumulation sets together. That is, it is the union of   all of the accumulation sets . When   ordering by set inclusion, the   supremum limit is the least upper   bound on the set of accumulation   points because it contains each of   them. Hence, it is the supremum of the   limit points. The infimum/inferior/inner limit is a   set where all of these accumulation sets meet. That is, it is the   intersection of all of the accumulation sets . When ordering by   set inclusion, the infimum limit is   the greatest lower bound on the set of   accumulation points because it is   contained in each of them. Hence, it   is the infimum of the limit points. The difference between the two   definitions involves the topology   (i.e., how to quantify separation) is   defined. In fact, the second   definition is identical to the first   when the discrete metric is used to   induce the topology on $X$. Because it mentions that a sequence of subsets of a set $X$ accumulate to some accumulation subsets of $X$, are there some topology on the power set of the set for this accumulation to make sense? What kind of topology is that? Is it induced from some structure on the set $X$? Is it possible to use mathematic symbols to formalize what it means by ""supremum/superior/outer limit""  and ""infimum/inferior/inner limit""? If I understand correctly, here is the first way to define limsup/liminf of a sequence of subsets. Quoted: General set convergence In this case, a sequence of sets   approaches a limiting set when its   elements of each member of the   sequence approach that elements of the   limiting set. In particular, if $\{X_n\}$   is a sequence of subsets of $X$, then: $\limsup X_n$, which is also called the   outer limit, consists of those   elements which are limits of points in   $X_n$ taken from (countably) infinitely   many n. That is, $x \in \limsup X_n$ if and   only if there exists a sequence of   points $x_k$ and a subsequence $\{X_{n_k}\}$ of   $\{X_n\}$ such that $x_k \in X_{n_k}$ and $x_k \rightarrow x$ as   $k \rightarrow \infty$. $\liminf X_n$, which is also called the   inner limit, consists of those   elements which are limits of points in   $X_n$ for all but finitely many n (i.e.,   cofinitely many n). That is, $x \in \liminf X_n$    if and only if there exists a   sequence of points $\{x_k\}$ such that $x_k \in X_k$    and $x_k \rightarrow x$ as $k \rightarrow \infty$. So I think for this definition, $X$ is required to be a topological space. This definition is expressed in terms of convergence of a sequence of points in $X$ with respect to the topology of $X$. If referring back to what is common for the two ways of definitions, I will be wondering how to explain what is a ""accumulation set"" in this definition here and what topology the ""accumulation set"" is with respect to? i.e. how can the definition here fit into aforementioned what is common for the two ways ? It says there are two ways to define the limit of a sequence of subsets of a set $X$. But there seems to be just one in the article, as quoted in 2. So I was wondering what is the second way it refers to? As you might give your answer, here is my thought/guess (which has actually been written in the article but not in a way saying it is the second one). Please correct me. In an arbitrary complete lattice, by viewing meet as inf and join as sup, the limsup of a sequence of points $\{x_n\}$ is defined as: $$\limsup \, x_n =  \inf_{n \geq 0} \left(\sup_{m \geq n} \, x_m\right) = \mathop{\wedge}\limits_{n \geq 0}\left( \mathop{\vee}\limits_{m\ \geq n} \, x_m\right) $$ similarly define liminf. The power set of any set is a complete lattice with union and intersection being join and meet, so the liminf and limsup of a sequence of subsets can be defined in the same way. I was wondering if this is the other way the article tries to introduce? If it is, then this second way of definition does not requires $X$ to be a topological space. So how can this second way fits to what is common for the two ways in Part 1, which seems to requires some kind of topology on the power set of $X$ ? I understand this way of definition can be shown to be equivalent to a special case of the first way  in my part 2         when the topology on $X$ is induced by discrete metric. This is another reason that let me doubt it is the second way, because I guess the second way should at least not be equivalent to a special case of the first way.

Assume $f_n$ converges uniformly to a function $f:X\to \R$ . Let $Z_n$ be the zero-set of $f_n$ , that is $Z_n$ is the set of all the points $x$ in $X$ such that $f_n(x) = 0$ . Let $Z$ be the zero-set of $f$ . Assume that there are two points $p$ and $q$ in $X$ such that $p, q\in Z_n$ for each $n$ . It follows that $p, q\in Z$ . Lemma. If $p$ and $q$ are in the same connected component of $Z_n$ for each $n$ , then they are also in the same connected component of $Z$ . (A proof of the lemma is at the end (I haven't seen it in a book or paper so there could be a mistake with my reasoning)). Question. Can we replace component with path component in the above lemma? In other words, if, for each $n$ , there was a path $\gamma_n:[0, 1]\to X$ such that $f_n\circ \gamma_n$ is identically $0$ and $\gamma_n(0) = p, \gamma_n(1)= q$ , then can we say that there is a path $\gamma:[0, 1] \to X$ with $f\circ \gamma$ being identically zero and $\gamma(0) = p, \gamma(1) = q$ . Proof of Lemma. Suppose not. First note that $f$ is continuous since it the uniform limit of a sequence of continuous functions on a compact metric space. Therefore $Z$ , like each $Z_n$ , is a closed subset of $X$ . Since we have assumed that $p$ and $q$ are in different components of $Z$ , there exist disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ of $X$ such that $p\in U, q\in V$ , $(U\cap Z) \cap (V\cap Z) = \emptyset$ , and $Z\subseteq U\cup V$ We claim that there exist $U'$ and $V'$ open in $X$ such that $\bar U'\subseteq U, \bar V'\subseteq V$ , $p\in U', q\in V'$ , $(Z\cap U')\cap(Z\cap V') = \emptyset$ , $Z\subseteq U'\cup V'$ To see this, for each point $x\in \bd(U)$ , where $\bd(U)$ means the boundary of $U$ , we can find a neighborhood $O_x$ of $x$ such that $\bar O_x$ is disjoint from $Z$ . Since $\bd(U)$ is compact, there exist finitely many points $x_1,\ldots, x_n$ in $\bd(U)$ such that $O_{x_1}\cup \cdots \cup O_{x_n}$ contains $\bd(U)$ . Define $U' = U \setminus (\bar O_{x_1}\cup \cdots \cup \bar O_{x_n})$ . By a similar procedure we construct $V'$ . Then $U'$ and $V'$ satisfy the requirement of the claim. Since $f_n$ converges uniformly to $f$ we get that $Z_n\subseteq U'\cup V'$ for each large enough $n$ . By passing to a tail we may assume that $Z_n\subseteq U'\cup V'$ for each $n$ . Now using the hypothesis that $p$ and $q$ are in the same component of $Z_n$ , we deduce that $(U'\cap Z_n) \cap (V'\cap Z_n)$ cannot be empty. So let $x_n \in (U'\cap Z_n)\cap (V'\cap Z_n)$ be chosen for each $n$ . Passing to a subsequence, we may assume that $x_n\to x$ for some $x\in X$ . Then $x$ must lie in $\overline{U'\cap V'}$ , and hence, in particular, it must lie in $U\cap V$ . Using $f_n(x_n) = 0$ for each $n$ , and the uniform convergence of $f_n$ to $f$ , we deduce that $f(x) = 0$ , that is $x\in Z$ . Therefore $x\in (U\cap Z) \cap (V\cap Z)$ , contradicting the choice of $U$ and $V$ . $\blacksquare$","Let be a compact metric space and be a continuous function on , one for each .

92,Motivation for separation axioms,Motivation for separation axioms,,"I have recently been studying different separation and countability axioms in topology. I am looking for a motivation for why such a refined division of different axioms was made and is studied. I am namely talking about the $T_{k}$ and $N_{k}$ hierarchy. I understand the Hausdorff property, i.e. $T_{2}$-property, is important in analysis and limits; and second countability, i.e. $N_{2}$-property, is important for example in integration on smooth manifolds when one constructs partitions of unity. Moreover, a metric space that is $N_{2}$ satisfies automatically most of the separation and all of the countability axioms. So what is the motivation of such a careful examination of all the different levels of separation and countability in general topology? Is it just for the sake of its own interest, or are there other good examples when one really needs to use different levels of this hierarchy? Especially the $T_{k}$ hierarchy.

94,Extending a continuous map between the boundary of two cells.,Extending a continuous map between the boundary of two cells.,,"I'm working in Lee's book on topological manifolds and have gotten stumped on the first question in chapter 5, the chapter on cell complexes.  The problem is: Let $D$ and $D'$ be two closed cells not necessarily of the same dimension. Show that any continuous map $f:\partial D \to \partial D'$ can be extended to a continuous map $F:D \to D'$ such that $F(Int \; D) \subseteq Int \; D'$. Given points $p \in Int \; D$ and $p' \in Int \; D'$, show that $F$ can be chosen so $F(p) = p'$. Show that if $f$ is a homeomorphism then $F$ can be chosen to be a homeomorphism. I proved the first part roughly as follows: First suppose $D$ and $D'$ are convex and each contain $0$ in their interior (in their respective ambient spaces).  Then every element other than $0$ in $D$ can be expressed uniquely in the form $\lambda q$ where $q \in \partial D$ and $\lambda\in (0,1]$ (an equivalence relation on the chords connecting $0$ to boundary points partitions $D- \{0\}$).  I then define the map $F(\lambda q) = \lambda f(q)$ which is continuous since if $\lambda_n q_n \to \lambda q$ in $D$ then $F(\lambda_n q_n) \to F(\lambda q)$.  Lastly $\lambda q \in Int \; D$ implies $\lambda <1$ and so $\lambda f(q)$ is an interior point of $D'$ since $f(q)$ is a boundary point and $D'$ is convex. Now if we suppose $D$ and $D'$ are arbitrary closed cells there are homeomorphisms $g_1: \overline{\mathbb{B}^n} \to D$ and $g_2: \overline{\mathbb{B}^m} \to D'$ (where possibly $m=n$) then we have that $g_2^{-1}\circ f \circ g_1$ is a continuous map between the boundaries of two closed balls and so by the first part can be extended to a continuous map $F:\overline{\mathbb{B}^n} \to \overline{\mathbb{B}^m}$.  The mapping $g_2 \circ F \circ g_1^{-1}$ is a continuous map that satisfies the desired claim. My issue is that parts 2 and 3 don't seem (to me at least) to follow that easily from the proof I constructed.  Maybe my proof is wrong and I'm not seeing it, but more likely I think that I'm missing the spirit in which Lee is intending for us to approach this problem.","I'm working in Lee's book on topological manifolds and have gotten stumped on the first question in chapter 5, the chapter on cell complexes.

95,How many subspace topologies of $\mathbb{R}$?,How many subspace topologies of ?,\mathbb{R},"Say two subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ are equivalent if they are homeomorphic, with the subspace topology.  How many equivalence classes are there? It's immediate that there are at least $\beth_0$ (we can get any finite discrete topology) and no more than $\beth_2 = \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R})$. I have a semi-complex construction below to show there are at least $\beth_1$. Without the generalized continuum hypothesis, this question seems harder and possibly independent.  I would be interested in an answer which assumes the continuum hypothesis, and thus answers either $\beth_1$ or $\beth_2$. Let's not complicated things too much, but we could also ask this question on $S^1$ and $\mathbb{R}^2$: on $S^1$ the construction below does not work, and on $\mathbb{R}^2$ it's much easier. Construction of $\beth_1$ non-homeomorphic subsets: The idea is that being a limit point, or being a limit point of limit points, or being a limit point of limit points of limit points... are topological properties.  For a given set $A \subset \mathbb{R}$, call a point A $P_0$ point if it is in $A$. A $P_n$ point if it is the limit point of $P_{n-1}$ points. A $Q_n$ point if it is a $P_n$ point, but not a $P_{n+1}$ point. A $R_n$ point if it is a $Q_n$ point and each neighborhood of the point (in A) is uncountable. The existence of a $R_n$ point is a topological invariant.  I claim that for any $J \subset \mathbb{N}$, it's possible to create $A \subset \mathbb{R}$ which has a $R_n$ point if and only if $n \in J$. To motivate the construction and the definition of $Q_n$, first think about constructing a $P_n$ point.  For example, the set $\{0\} \cup \{ 1/k : k \in \mathbb{N} \}$ has $0$ as a $P_1$ point.  Now, add some points to that set: on each interval $(1/(k+1), 1/k)$, add a sequence of points limiting to $1/(k+1)$.  Then The points we just added are $P_0$ points. For each $k$, the point $1/k$ is a $P_1$ point and a $P_0$ point, and thus a $Q_1$ point but not a $Q_0$ point. 0 is a $P_2$ point, a $P_1$ point, and a $P_0$ point.  Therefore it is a $Q_2$ point. Now, it would be simpler if we didn't need the $R_n$ definition.  But as you see, we can't make a $Q_n$ point without also making a $Q_{n-1}$ point.  Now consider adding the interval $(-1, 0)$ to the set we've constructed so far.  The $0$ would be a $R_2$ point, but there would be no $R_1$ or $R_0$ points.
