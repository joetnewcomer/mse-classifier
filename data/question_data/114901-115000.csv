1,Nice expression for minimum of three variables?,Nice expression for minimum of three variables?,,"As we saw here , the minimum of two quantities can be written using elementary functions and the absolute value function. $\min(a,b)=\frac{a+b}{2} - \frac{|a-b|}{2}$ There's even a nice intuitive explanation to go along with this: If we go to the point half way between two numbers, then going down by half their difference will take us to the smaller one. So my question is: ""Is there a similar formula for three numbers?"" Obviously $\min(a,\min(b,c))$ will work, but this gives us the expression: $$\frac{a+\left(\frac{b+c}{2} - \frac{|b-c|}{2}\right)}{2} - \frac{\left|a-\left(\frac{b+c}{2} - \frac{|b-c|}{2}\right)\right|}{2},$$ which isn't intuitively the minimum of three numbers, and isn't even symmetrical in the variables, even though its output is.

10,What are the Laws of Rational Exponents?,What are the Laws of Rational Exponents?,,"On Math SE, I've seen several questions which relate to the following. By abusing the laws of exponents for rational exponents, one can come up with any number of apparent paradoxes, in which a number seems to be shown as equal to its opposite (negative). Possibly the most concise example: $-1 = (-1)^1 = (-1)^\frac{2}{2} = (-1)^{2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = ((-1)^2)^\frac{1}{2} = (1)^\frac{1}{2} = \sqrt{1} = 1$ Of the seven equalities in this statement, I'm embarrassed to say that I'm not totally sure which one is incorrect. Restricting the discussion to real numbers and rational exponents, we can look at some college algebra/precalculus books and find definitions like the following (here, Ratti & McWaters, Precalculus: a right triangle approach , section P.6): The thing that looks the most suspect in my example above is the 4th equality, $(-1)^{2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = ((-1)^2)^\frac{1}{2}$ , which seems to violate the spirit of Ratti's definition of rational exponents (""no common factors"")... but technically, that translation from rational exponent to radical expression was not used at this point.

The rational-exponent-to-radical-expression switch (via the rational exponent definition) doesn't actually happen until the 6th equality, $(1)^\frac{1}{2} = \sqrt{1}$ , and that seems to undeniably be a true statement. So I'm a bit stumped at exactly where the falsehood lies. We can find effectively identical definitions in other books. For example, in Sullivan's College Algebra , his definition is (sec. R.8): ""If $a$ is a real number and $m$ and $n$ are integers containing no common factors, with $n \ge 2$ , then: $a^\frac{m}{n} = \sqrt[n]{a^m} = (\sqrt[n]{a})^m$ , provided that $\sqrt[n]{a}$ exists""; and he briefly states that ""the Laws of Exponents hold for rational exponents"", but all examples are restricted to positive variables only. OpenStax College Algebra does the same (sec. 1.3): ""In these cases, the exponent must be a fraction in lowest terms... All of the properties of exponents that we learned for integer exponents also hold for rational exponents."" So what exactly are the restrictions on the Laws of Exponents in the real-number context, with rational exponents? As one example, is there a reason missing from the texts above why $(-1)^{2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = ((-1)^2)^\frac{1}{2}$ is a false statement, or is it one of the other equalities that fails?

I approached this problem in a rather boring way. That is, the first expression satisfies the equation, $$y=\sqrt[3]{9+9y} \implies y^3=9+9y$$ and the second one satisfies, $$x=+\sqrt{8-\sqrt{8-\sqrt{8+x}}} \implies \left[(x^2-8)^2-8\right]^2=8+x$$ Now this magically factors into  $$(x^2 - x - 8) (x^3 - 2 x^2 - 11 x + 23) (x^3 + 3 x^2 - 6 x - 17) = 0$$ It turns out that the $x$ we are looking is the solution of the third factor. And so, $$x^3 + 3 x^2 - 6 x - 17=0 \implies (x+1)^3-9(x+1)-9=0$$  And magically $x+1=y$. The problem here is that this does not give me much understanding of nested radicals, it is just plain bash.

96,Solve $x^4+3x^3+6x+4=0$... easier way?,Solve ... easier way?,x^4+3x^3+6x+4=0,"So I was playing around with solving polynomials last night and realized that I had no idea how to solve a polynomial with no rational roots, such as $$x^4+3x^3+6x+4=0$$ Using the rational roots test, the possible roots are $\pm1, \pm2, \pm4$ , but none of these work. Because there were no rational linear factors, I had to assume that  the quartic separated into two quadratic equations yielding either imaginary or irrational ""pairs"" of roots.  My initial attempt was to ""solve for the coefficients of these factors"". I assumed that $x^4+3x^3+6x+4=0$ factored into something that looked like this $$\left(x^2+ax+b\right)\left(x^2+cx+d\right)=0$$ because the coefficient of the first term is one.  Expanding this out I got $$x^4+ax^3+cx^3+bx^2+acx^2+dx^2+adx+bcx+bd=0$$ $$x^4+\left(a+c\right)x^3+\left(b+ac+d\right)x^2+\left(ad+bc\right)x+bd=0$$ Equating the coefficients of both equations $$a+c = 3$$ $$b+ac+d = 0$$ $$ad+bc = 6$$ $$bd = 4$$ I found these relationships between the various coefficients.   Solving this system using the two middle equations: $$\begin{cases} b+a\left(3-a\right)+\frac4b=0 \\ a\frac4b+b\left(3-a\right)=6 \end{cases}$$ From the first equation: $$a = \frac{3\pm\sqrt{9+4b+\frac{16}{b}}}{2}$$ Substituting this into the second equation: $$\frac{3\pm\sqrt{9+4b+\frac{16}{b}}}{2}\cdot\frac4b+b\cdot\left(3-\frac{3\pm\sqrt{9+4b+\frac{16}{b}}}{2}\right)=6$$ $$3\left(b-2\right)^2 = \left(b^2-4\right)\cdot\pm\sqrt{9+4b+\frac{16}b}$$ $$0 = \left(b-2\right)^2\cdot\left(\left(b+2\right)^2\left(9+4b+\frac{16}b\right)-9\left(b-2\right)^2\right)$$ So $b = 2$ because everything after $\left(b-2\right)^2$ did not really matter in this case.  From there it was easy to get that $d = 2$ , $a = -1$ and $c = 4$ .  This meant that $$x^4+3x^3+6x+4=0 \to \left(x^2-x+2\right)\left(x^2+4x+2\right)=0$$ $$x = \frac12\pm\frac{\sqrt7}{2}i,\space x = -2\pm\sqrt2$$ These answers worked!
