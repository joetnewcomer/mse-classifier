If the requirement $||x|| \leq 1+\delta$ is dropped, the existence of such an $x$ follows from the surjectivity of $\Phi : X \to \mathbb{C}^{n}, x \mapsto (\phi_1(x), \dots, \phi_n(x)).$  Let now $Y = \cap_{i} \ker \phi_i = \ker \Phi$. Every element of $x+Y \cap (1+\delta) B_{X}$ has the required property, so that it suffices to show that the latter set is not empty.  Assume that it is empty.

98,Linear projections and topological direct sum in normed/Banach spaces,Linear projections and topological direct sum in normed/Banach spaces,,"When learning about the concept of complemented subspaces of a Banach space, I'm curious with the following question: Let $X$ be a vector space over $\mathbb{C}$ or $\mathbb{R}$ and let $E$ and $F$ be algebraic complemented subspaces with trivial intersection, such that $X=\ E\oplus F$ . If defining a norm $\|\cdot\|$ on $X$ , and equipping $E$ and $F$ with their norm-induced subspace topologies, respectively, is it always true that, as topological spaces, $X\simeq E\times F$ ? A closely related proposition in terms of linear projections can be stated as follows. Let $(X, \|\cdot\|)$ be a normed space over $\mathbb{C}$ or $\mathbb{R}$ , and $P: X\to X$ a linear projection such that $P^2=P$ . Then, do we always have a topological direct sum result $X\simeq \text{ran}(P) \oplus \text{Ker}(P)$ , where the range and kernel are equipped with their subspace topologies, respectively? Here I'm not assuming continuity of $P$ or whether the range or kernel are closed subspaces. Background: I'm trying to understand, on Banach spaces, why there can be discontinuous projections with a closed range. In a Banach space $X$ , if a subspace $E\subset X$ is closed, then its quotient space $X/E$ is a Banach space (complete) under the quotient norm. Purely algebraically, we would then have $X \simeq E \oplus (X/E)$ . But, for a subspace $F\subset X$ algebraically complemented to $E$ , we would also have algebraic direct sum result $X=E\oplus F$ . This seems to suggest, the natural algebraic isomorphism from $F$ to $(X/E)$ should also be a homeomorphism. But, since not every closed subspace $E$ is (alg + top) complemented, that shouldn't be true. My question is to help me understand this confusion. If the propositions in my question are true, then I can understand, even when $\text{ran}(P)$ is closed, the algebraic isomorphism from $X/\text{ran}(P)$ to $\text{Ker}(P)$ can fail to be a homeomorphism. So the kernel can still be non-closed. I already know the following two facts/propositions about linear projections on Banach spaces. If a projection $P$ is continuous, then $\text{ran}(P)$ is closed, since it is the kernel of $I-P$ . If a projeciton $P$ has closed range and closed kernel, it is continuous. This can be proved since everything is Banach (complete) and so we can freely apply the Open Mapping Thm/Inverse Mapping Thm wherever possible. See here . Thanks in advance. Update: The conclusive answer should be the following. Let $X$ be a normed vector space and $E\subset X$ a closed subspace, with its purely algebraic complemented subspace $F\subset X$ such that $X=E\oplus F$ . Then, the original norm topology $\tau_X$ of the whole space, the product topology of the subspaces $\tau|_E \times \tau|_F$ , and the product topology with the quotient space $\tau|_E \times \tau_{X/E}$ , are in general all different.","When learning about the concept of complemented subspaces of a Banach space, I'm curious with the following question: Let be a vector space over or and let and be algebraic complemented subspaces with trivial intersection, such that .
