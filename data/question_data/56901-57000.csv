The problem here is that when another function was tried, there was no closed form: which has no closed form in terms of any official special functions, but may possibly have a closed form with function because: Goal: @skbmoore’s solution is excellent, but is there an explicit expression for the coefficients Also see this related post where the solution includes this function: The positive root of the transcendental equation","xe^x=y\implies x=\text W(y)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{(-n)^{n-1}y^n}{n!},|y|<\frac1e e^{-x}\left(\frac{x^2}2+x+1\right) \sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(pn+q)^{rn+s}Γ(An+B,Cn+D)}{Γ(an+b)} \text W(xe^x)=x Q(a,z)=\frac{\Gamma(a,z)}{\Gamma(a)}=\frac{\int_z^\infty t^{a-1}e^{-t}dt }{\Gamma(z)} z=1 Q(a,Q^{-1}(a,z))=z, Q^{-1}(a,z)=((1-z)\Gamma(a+1))^\frac1a+\frac{((1-z)\Gamma(a+1))^\frac2a}{a+1}+\frac{(3a+5)((1-z)\Gamma(a+1))^\frac3a}{2(a+1)^2(a+2)}+… Q(1,z)=e^{-z}\implies Q^{-1}(1,z)=-\ln(z)\\Q(2,z)=e^{-z}(z+1)\implies Q^{-1}(2,z)=-\text W_{-1}\left(-\frac ze\right)-1\\Q(3,z)=e^{-z}\left(\frac{z^2}2+z+1\right)\implies Q^{-1}(3,z)=((1-z)\Gamma(3+1))^\frac13+\frac{((1-z)\Gamma(3+1))^\frac23}{3+1}+\frac{(3\cdot3+5)((1-z)\Gamma(3+1))^\frac33}{2(3+1)^2(3+2)}+…=(-6)^\frac13(z-1)^\frac13+\frac{(-6)^\frac23}4 (z-1)^\frac23-\frac{21}{40}(z-1)-\frac{461 (-6)^\frac13}{480}(z-1)^\frac43-\frac{3049 (-6)^\frac23(z-1)^\frac53}{33600}+\frac{11013(z-1)^2}{44800}+…=\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n (-6)^\frac n3(z-1)^\frac n3 x=1 x=0 f’(0)=0 0\le x\le 1 y=f(x)=e^{-x}\left(\frac{x^2}2+x+1\right)=Q(3,x) \implies f^{-1}(y)=Q^{-1}(3,y)=x=1+\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{d^{n-1}}{dy^{n-1}}\left(\left(\frac{y-1}{e^{-y}\left(\frac{y^2}2+y+1\right)-\frac5{2e}}\right)^n\right)\frac{\left(x-\frac5{2e}\right)^n}{n!}=1-2e\left(x-\frac5{2e}\right)-\frac{4e^2}{2!}\left(x-\frac5{2e}\right)^2-\frac{32e^3}{3!} \left(x-\frac5{2e}\right)^3-\frac{384e^4}{4!}\left(x-\frac5{2e}\right)^4= 1-2e\left(x-\frac5{2e}\right)-2e^2\left(x-\frac5{2e}\right)^2-\frac{16e^3}{3} \left(x-\frac5{2e}\right)^3-16e^4\left(x-\frac5{2e}\right)^4 -…=\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n e^n \left(x-\frac5{2e}\right)^n= \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n \left(e x -\frac52\right)^n  a_n=\left\{1,2,2,\frac{16}3,16,…\right\}=\frac{\frac{d^{n-1}}{dy^{n-1}}\left(\left(\frac{y-1}{e^{-y}\left(\frac{y^2}2+y+1\right)-\frac5{2e}}\right)^n\right)}{n!} Q^{-1}(3,x): \text W_{-1}(x) \text W(x)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-n)^{n-1}x^n}{n!},|x|<\frac1e \text W^{k-1}(ax)\text W(ax) x^b= \text W^{k-1}(ax) x^b\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-n)^{n-1}(ax)^n}{n!} \int \text W^k(ax)x^bdx=\int \sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{(-n)^{n-1}\text W^{n-1}(x)x^{n+k}}{n!}dx= x^b e^{-b \text W(a x)} \text W^k(a x) (-(b + 1)\text W(a x))^{-b - k} ((b + 1) Γ(b + k + 1, -(b + 1) \text W(a x)) - Γ(b + k + 2, -(b + 1)\text W(a x)))\frac1{a (b + 1)^2} +C =C+\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{ ((-n)^{n - 2} n x^{k + n}\text W(a x)^{k + 1} e^{-(k + n)\text W(a x)} (-(k + n + 1)\text W(a x))^{-(2 k + n + 1} (Γ(2 k + n + 1, -(k + n + 1) \text W(a x)) - (k + n + 1) Γ(2 k + n, -(k + n + 1) \text W(a x)))}{a n!}  \int \sqrt{\text W(x)}dx=\frac{\sqrt\pi}{4}\text{erfi}\big(\sqrt{\text W(x)}\big)+x\sqrt{\text W(x)}-\frac{x}{2\sqrt{\text W(x)}}+C=C+\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-n)^{n - 1} x^n \text W^\frac32(x) \left((n + 1) Γ\left(n + \frac12, -(n + 1) \text W(x)\right) - Γ\left(n + \frac32, -(n + 1) \text W(x)\right)\right)}{(-(n + 1) \text W(x))^{n +\frac32} e^{n \text W(x)} n!}   x=0 e^{\text W(x)+x}=e^ {\text W(x)}\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{x^k}{k!}\implies \int e^{\text W(x)+x} dx=\int e^ {\text W(x)}\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n!}dx=\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^nx^k ((k + 2) Γ(k + 1, -(k + 2) \text W(x)) - Γ(k + 2, -(k + 2)\text W(x)))}{(k + 2)^{k+2} \text W^k(x) e^{k\text W(x)} k!} =?

Show that  converges for all  and examine continuity of the limit function.,\alpha>0 \sum_{n=1}^\infty {\sin nx\over n^\alpha} x\in\Bbb{R},"First of all I have proved that this series of functions $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty {\sin nx\over n^\alpha}$$ converges $\forall x\in\Bbb{R}$ . Let $f_n(x)=\sin nx$ and $g_n(x)=\frac{1}{n^\alpha}$ . Let us fix $x\in\Bbb{R}$ . Now, let $a_n=f_n(x)$ and $b_n=g_n(x)$ . Now if $x=2m\pi$ for some $m\in\Bbb{Z}$ , $a_n=0$ , hence the series $\sum a_nb_n$ converges to $0$ . Now we assume $x\ne2m\pi$ for any $m\in\Bbb{Z}$ . Then the partial sums of $(a_n)$ to be $A_n=\sum_{k=1}^{n}a_k$ . Then $$ \left| A_n \right| = \left| \sin x + \sin 2x + \cdots + \sin nx \right| = \left|\frac{\sin{\frac{nx}{2}}\sin {\frac{(n+1)x}{2}}}{\sin{\frac{x}{2}}}\right| \le \frac{1}{\left|\sin{\frac{x}{2}}\right|} $$ and $\frac{1}{\left|\sin{\frac{x}{2}}\right|} \in \Bbb{R}$ since $x \ne 2m\pi$ . So, partial sums of $(a_n)$ are bounded. Again $b_n={1\over n^\alpha}$ is monotone decreasing and converges to $0$ . Hence by Dirichlet's test the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_nb_n$ converges. Thus the series of functions $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin nx}{n^\alpha}$ converges for all $x\in\Bbb{R}$ . Let $$ f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin nx}{n^\alpha} $$ My target is to find where the function $f$ is continuous. Let us choose a point $a\in\Bbb{R}$ such that $a\ne2m\pi$ for any $m\in\Bbb{Z}$ . Now we can always find a compact interval $I$ containing $a$ such that $\sin \frac{x}{2} \ne 0$ $\forall x\in I$ since we have chosen $a\ne2m\pi$ . Since, $I$ is compact interval and $\sin$ function is continuous we have $\min_{x\in I}\lvert \sin \frac{x}{2} \rvert = m > 0 $ . We will show that the series of functions $\sum f_n g_n$ converges uniformly on $I$ by using Dirichlet's test for the series of functions. Let $(F_n)$ denotes the sequence of partial sums of $(f_n)$ . Then for all $x\in I$ , $\left|F_n(x)\right|\le \frac{1}{\lvert\sin\frac{x}{2}\rvert}\le\frac{1}{m}$ , hence the sequence of functions $(F_n)$ is uniformly bounded over $I$ . Again, the sequence of function $g_n(x)={1\over n^\alpha}$ is monotone decreasing and converging uniformly to $0$ function. Thus by Dirichlet's Test for series of functions the series of functions $\sum f_n(x)g_n(x) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\sin nx}{n^\alpha}$ converges uniformly over $I$ . Since the functions $f_n g_n$ are continuous on $I$ , the limit function $f$ is continuous on $I$ . In particular since $a\in I$ , $f$ is continuous at $a$ . So I found $f$ is continuous on the set $\Bbb{R}\setminus \{2m\pi \mid m\in\Bbb{Z}\}$ . But what about the points like $2m\pi$ ? I observed that $f$ is $0$ at those points.

71,Is there a closed-form for $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{n}{n^3+1}$?,Is there a closed-form for ?,\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{n}{n^3+1},"I'm reading a book on complex variables ( The Theory of Functions of a Complex Variable , Thorn 1953) and the following is shown: Let $f(z)$ be holomorphic and single valued in $\mathbb{C}$ except at a finite number of points $a_1,\ldots, a_k$ which are not integers or half-integers , where $f(z)$ has poles or essential singularities. Further, suppose there is some $d$ for which if $|z|>m(d)$ , $ |z^2 f(z)|<d $ . Then $$ \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} f(n) = -\pi \sum_{n=1}^{k} r_n \cot(\pi a_n), $$ where $r_n$ is the residue of $f(z)$ at $z=a_n$ . Here is a sketch of the proof I supplied: the condition of no $a_n$ integers or half-integers is to prevent 'coupling' between $f$ and cotangent. Let $C_m$ be the counterclockwise rectangular contour with vertices $\pm(m+1/2)\pm m i$ ; choose $m>1$ big enough so that each $a_n$ is contained in the interior of $C_m$ and the growth condition is satisfied. Then $$ \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int _{C_m} \pi \cot(\pi z) f(z)\,dz = \sum_{n=-m}^{m}f(n) + \pi\sum_{n=1}^{k} \pi r_n \cot(\pi a_n) $$ A brute force argument shows that along $C_m$ , $|\cot(\pi z)|<\coth(\pi m)<2$ . Now we use the growth condition: $$ \left|\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int _{C_m} \pi \cot(\pi z) f(z)\,dz\right| \leq \frac{1}{2}\int _{C_m} \left| \cot(\pi z) f(z)\right|\,dz $$ $$ <\int _{C_m} \left|f(z)\right|\,dz \leq (8m+2) \max_{z\in C_m} |f(z)| < \frac{(8m+2)d}{m^2} $$ So as $m\to \infty$ , the LHS approaches $0$ and the result follows. Fine. Now, the series in my title is the second part of an exercise; the first part has you evaluate $\displaystyle{\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2+1}}$ , which is done by writing: $$ \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2+1} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2+1}+1\right) $$ $$ = \frac{1}{2}\left(-\pi \left(\frac{-i}{2}\cot(\pi i)+\frac{i}{2}\cot(-\pi i)\right)+1\right) = \frac{1+\pi\coth(\pi)}{2} $$ But then the book claims $\displaystyle{\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{n}{n^3+1}}$ can be evaluated as well. I am skeptical because the singularity occurs at $n=-1$ , as opposed to $\pm i$ in the previous problem, and I don't think the same symmetry trick can work; further, this is the only relevant section of the chapter to this exercise. Mathematica gives the value $$ \frac{-1}{3}\sum_{k=0}^2 \frac{\psi(-\exp(2\pi i (2k+1)/6))}{\exp(2\pi i (2k+1)/6)}, $$ where $\psi$ is the digamma function, which is less than transparent, though I could buy how we could get there from the cotangent sum. I'm not sure if the sum has a nicer closed-form or if this is as best as can be done.","I'm reading a book on complex variables ( The Theory of Functions of a Complex Variable , Thorn 1953) and the following is shown: Let be holomorphic and single valued in except at a finite number of points which are not integers or half-integers , where has poles or essential singularities.

I am skeptical because the singularity occurs at , as opposed to in the previous problem, and I don't think the same symmetry trick can work; further, this is the only relevant section of the chapter to this exercise. Mathematica gives the value where is the digamma function, which is less than transparent, though I could buy how we could get there from the cotangent sum. I'm not sure if the sum has a nicer closed-form or if this is as best as can be done.","f(z) \mathbb{C} a_1,\ldots, a_k f(z) d |z|>m(d)

80,Closed forms of $f(s;q)=\sum_{k\ge1}\frac{(-1)^k}{k^s+q^s}$,Closed forms of,f(s;q)=\sum_{k\ge1}\frac{(-1)^k}{k^s+q^s},"I am investigating closed forms of the function $$f(s;q)=\sum_{k\ge1}\frac{(-1)^k}{k^s+q^s}.$$ I of course don't expect a closed form for general $s$ and $q$ (such that the series converges), but I am rather interested in special cases. There is of course the easily-shown relation $$f(s;0)=(2^{1-s}-1)\zeta(s),$$ from which it is immediately evident that $f$ is some sort of analog of the classic zeta function. My efforts have mostly been focused on special cases for fixed values of $s$ , such as the easily shown $$f(1;q)=\int_0^1\frac{x^qdx}{1+x}.$$ Note that since this integral has no closed form for general $q$ , I am willing to count the integral itself as a closed form, as it is certainly easy to evaluate for $q\in\Bbb Q_{\ge0}$ . If something similar is the best we can do in other cases, so be it. My own work has been primarily regarding the cases $f(2^n;q)$ , and I have succeeded in finding a recurrence in $n$ . First, we evaluate $f(2;q)$ . To do so we define $\zeta_m=\exp\frac{i\pi}{m}$ , as we will use it a lot later. Recall the formula $$\frac{\pi}{\sin\pi z}=\sum_{k\in\Bbb Z}\frac{(-1)^k}{z+k},$$ so that $$\sum_{k\ge 1}\frac{(-1)^k}{k^2-z^2}=-\frac\pi{2z\sin\pi z}+\frac1{2z^2}.$$ Setting $z=iq$ and simplifying gives $$f(2;q)=\sum_{k\ge1}\frac{(-1)^k}{k^2+q^2}=\frac{\pi e^{\pi q}/q}{e^{2\pi q}-1}-\frac1{2q^2}.$$ This, interestingly enough, gives the limit $$\lim_{q\to 0}\left(\frac{\pi e^{\pi q}/q}{e^{2\pi q}-1}-\frac1{2q^2}\right)=-\frac{\pi^2}{12}.$$ I would like to discuss this limit further, but that may not be on topic on this post. Back to the investigation at hand, we see that $$\begin{align} f(2M;q)&=\sum_{k\ge1}\frac{(-1)^k}{(k^{M}-iq^{M})(k^{M}+iq^{M})}\qquad [M=2^n]\\ &=\frac{1}{2iq^M}\sum_{k\ge1}(-1)^k\left(\frac{1}{k^M-iq^M}-\frac{1}{k^M+iq^M}\right)\\ &=\tfrac{1}{2iq^M}f(M;\zeta_{2M}^3q)-\tfrac{1}{2iq^M}f(M;\zeta_{2M}q). \end{align}$$ Thus, since we know $f(2;q)$ , we also know $f(M;q)$ .
