0,Shortest possible unreachable shape,Shortest possible unreachable shape,,"This is a follow up to Is every shape possible with a snake? . Imagine a 2d snake formed by drawing a horizontal line of length $n$.  At integer points along its body, this snake can rotate its body by $90$ degrees either clockwise or counter clockwise. If we define the front of the snake to be on the far left to start with, the rotation will move the back part of the snake and the front part will stay put. By doing repeated rotations it can make a lot of different snake body shapes. Now let us define a valid shape. A shape is valid if it can be formed from a straight line snake by applying at most one $90$ degree bend at each one of the integer points along its body and no two parts of the resulting shape intersect or touch each other. We now apply some further rules to say a shape is reachable .  A shape is reachable if it is valid and it is possible to reach the orientation without any parts of the snake's body intersecting or touching in between.  This includes during the rotations needed to bend a part at right angles. Here are some examples thanks to Martin Büttner. We start with the horizontal snake. Now we rotate from position 4. We end up after the rotation in this orientation. Now let us consider this orientation of a different snake. We can now see an illegal move where there would be an overlap caused during the rotation. When a rotation happens it will move one half of the snake with it. We do have to worry about whether any of this part which is rotated might overlap a part of the snake during the rotation.  For simplicity we can assume the snake has width zero.  You can only rotate at a particular point in snake up to 90 degrees clockwise of counter clockwise. For, you can never full fold the snake in two as that would have involved two rotations at the same point in the same direction. Shapes that can't be reached A shape that can't be reached is (Thank you to Harald Hanche-Olsen for this example) In this example all the adjacent horizontal lines are 1 apart as are the vertical ones. There is therefore no legal move from this position and as the problem is reversible there is therefore no way to get there from the starting position. We say that the length of a valid shape is simply the length of a snake that could form it. For example, the example shape above which can't be reached has length $59$.

2,How many lattices does it take to cover a regular $n$-gon?,How many lattices does it take to cover a regular -gon?,n,"Given some positive integer $n\ge 3$ , we can ask how many 2-dimensional lattices $L_1,\ldots,L_k$ are required such that their disjoint union contains all vertices of a regular $n$ -gon.

4,Are there prime lengths in triangle with all integer sides and heights?,Are there prime lengths in triangle with all integer sides and heights?,,"Suppose you have a triangle in which all sides and all heights are integer in length (i.e. triangle with sides 20, 25, 15 has heights 15, 12 and 20). Could it be that at least one of those numbers is prime? It is very easy to prove that if the numbers are all different then at most 3 of them could be prime. Suppose that $a$, $b$ and $c$ are sides and $h_{a}, h_{b}$ and $h_{c}$ are corresponding heights. Then double area of the triangle is $a h_{a} = b h_{b} = c h_{c}$. If there are 4 or more prime numbers then one equation would be product of two prime numbers (by pigeonhole principle), but by fundamental theorem of arithmetic there is only a single way to express the number as product of primes which contradicts the preposition that all numbers are different. This is fairly weak result, but result nonetheless. I dug a bit further and (according to Wolfram Mathworld ) the triangle which has all integer sides and integer area is called a Heronian triangle (all 'our' triangles are Heronian, but not all Heronian triangles are 'our'). At that page there is a generative formula which immediately$^{*}$ shows that none of sides can be prime, and quite obviously height opposing $c$ can't be prime. I haven't got far trying to prove that other two heights can't be prime either, but I've written a small script which iterates m, n and k up to 500 and yet to find any prime numbers (so far 270K triangles out of 61M triples I intend to iterate over, 54M to go). [*] On 'immediately': Originally I claimed that sides can't be prime because they are products of integer numbers. In comments Steven Stadnicki raised the point that $m$ or $n$ (or both) can be equal to 1 which would lead to possibility of prime sides. I've shown that this is impossible to have prime side with that condition. Here is the copy of generative formulas from that page for reference: $a = n(m^{2}+k^{2})\\ b = m(n^{2}+k^{2})\\ c = (m+n)(mn-k^{2})\\ S = kmn(m+n)(mn-k^{2})\\ GCD(m,n,k) = 1; mn > k^{2} \ge m^{2}n/(2m+n); m \ge n \ge 1$ First we can easily see that both $m$ and $n$ can't be 1 (as $mn > k^{2}$), so only $n$ can be 1, and $m \ge 2$. I'm going to prove that if $n=1$ and $a$ is prime ($b$ is definitely composite) then $h_{a}$ is not integer, thus that triangle is not conforming. Let $a = p$, where $p$ is prime and $n = 1$. Then $h_{a} = 2S/p = 2km(m+1)(m-k^{2})/p$. For $h_{a}$ to be integer there should be at least one factor in numerator which is divisible by $p$. Thus one of following should be true (where $q$ is a natural number): $\tag{a} 2=q(m^{2}+k^{2})$ $\tag{b} k=q(m^{2}+k^{2})$ $\tag{c} m=q(m^{2}+k^{2})$ $\tag{d} m+1=q(m^{2}+k^{2})$  $\tag{e} m-k^{2}=q(m^{2}+k^{2})$ As $m \ge 2$ it is obvious that (a) can't be true.

For example let's take (e) and try to solve for $m$: $0 = qm^{2}-m+k^{2}(1+q)$, discriminant is $1-4qk^{2}(1+q)$ which is negative for any natural $q$ and $k$, thus there no such $m$.

8,To whom do we owe this construction of angles and trigonometry?,To whom do we owe this construction of angles and trigonometry?,,"I've come across what is, to me, the most precise, beautiful and thorough definition of what we know of as the angle between two vectors. I say this because most literature either skims over things and starts talking about angles all of the sudden, or uses a contrived definition like the unique $\theta\in[0,\pi]$ such that $\|u\|\|v\|\cos\theta = u\cdot v$ . Yes it works fine, but it leaves me quite unsatisfied; I should like to already have an ""intrinsic"" definition of an angle, and then let the cosine function be defined to tell me things about angles. Why, the other way around we have to define cosine by some magical power series, and then it turns out that the above definition makes angles behave as they should! To me it seems disingenuous, but thoughts on this are welcome. Anyway, the construction comes from a book called Àlgebra Lineal i Geometria (Castellet/Llerena), and I'd like to know if anyone has seen it, other than in this book of course. I'll post the beginning of the section (translated from Catalan, and paraphrased): Let $(E,\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle)$ be a $2$ -dimensional Euclidean space. In the set of pairs of unit vectors, define the equivalence relationship $$(u,u')\sim(v,v') \iff \exists f\in SO(2) : f(u)=v,\, f(u') = v'$$ This condition is proven to be equivalent to $\exists g\in SO(2) : g(u)=u',\, g(v) = v'$ . We define an angle as one of these equivalence classes. We denote the class represented by $(u,u')$ as $[(u,u')] = \widehat{uu'}$ . This can be easily extended to $E\times E$ by defining $\widehat{uv}$ as the angle defined by $\frac{u}{\|u\|},\frac{v}{\|v\|}$ . Call the set of angles $A =E\times E_{\large{/\sim}}$ and for any $u\in E$ define a map $$SO(2)\longrightarrow A \atop \qquad\qquad\, f\mapsto \widehat{uf(u)}$$ This is in fact a bijection, and allows us to transport the operation in $SO(2)$ to $A$ : given $\alpha,\beta\in A$ with preimages $f,g$ respectively, define the sum $\alpha+\beta$ as the image of $f\circ g$ . In class notation: $$\left.\begin{align}&\alpha = [(u,f(u))] \\ &\beta = [(f(u),gf(u))]\end{align}\right\}\Rightarrow \alpha+\beta = [(u,gf(u))]$$ Naturally, this sum has the same properties in $A$ as does the operation in $SO(2)$ . $A$ is then an abelian group, whose identity is $0 = \widehat{uu}$ . The inverse, or opposite angle of $\widehat{uf(u)}$ is $\widehat{f(u)u}$ . Here comes the fun part. By fixing an orientation on $E$ , each $f\in SO(2)$ has a corresponding matrix $$\left(\begin{array}{ccc}a & -b \\ b & a\end{array}\right)\text{ with } a^2+b^2 = 1$$ Let $\alpha$ be the angle corresponding to $f$ . We define the cosine , and the sine , of $\alpha$ by $$\cos\alpha = a\qquad \sin\alpha = b$$ Too clever. And it gets better: We'll make a couple of observations now about this definition. Firstly, in changing the orientation of $E$ the sign of $\sin\alpha$ changes, but not $\cos\alpha$ . One has $$\cos0 = 1\qquad \sin0 = 0$$ since the angle $0$ corresponds to $\mathrm{id}$ . The angle $-\alpha$ (the opposite wrt the sum) corresponds to $f^{-1}$ , whose matrix is the transpose of $f$ 's matrix; therefore: $$\cos(-\alpha) = \cos\alpha\qquad \sin(-\alpha) = -\sin(\alpha)$$ The angle $\alpha + \beta$ corresponds to the composition of their respective maps. Thus, matrix multiplication gives: $$\begin{align}\cos(\alpha+\beta) = \cos\alpha\cos\beta-\sin\alpha\sin\beta \\ \sin(\alpha+\beta) = \sin\alpha\cos\beta+\cos\alpha\sin\beta\end{align}$$ To finish I'll put some subsequent propositions without proofs. There exists one, and only one angle $\pi$ such that $\pi+\pi = 0$ . $\pi$ is the angle such that $\cos\pi = -1$ and $\sin\pi = 0$ . There exist two, and only two angles $\delta_1,\delta_2$ such that $\delta_i + \delta_i = \pi$ . $\delta_i$ are the angles such that $\cos\delta_1 = \cos\delta_2 = 0$ and $\sin\delta_1 = -\sin\delta_2 = 1$ . We call these right angles. $\widehat{uv}$ is a right angle iff $\langle u,v\rangle = 0$ The text continues proving things like these. My question is whether anyone has seen this, or a similar extensive treatment. Also though, I'm interested in finding any text that formally links the primitive angles, sine and cosine from geometry to the sine and cosine we now all know and love from calculus, or even complex analysis, preferably with geometry as a starting point. Notes: Obviously there are well definedness issues to address. It seems this is left to the reader. Should I post this on mathoverflow? I've never used it but something tells me a bibliographic inquiry like this one could fit. Unfortunately, angles are now abstract objects, and we haven't at all defined the sine or cosine of a real number, so I'm thinking of a way to map real numbers to angles.

34,Projection of fiber bundle is a submersion,Projection of fiber bundle is a submersion,,"I'm just wondering about my proof for the following fact. I get the feeling it is almost trivial but I am still getting a feel for geometry and so it doesn't seem 'obvious' to me just yet. The projection $\pi$ of the fiber bundle $(E,\pi,M,F)$ is a submersion. Is the below argument a correct proof of this fact? Would it be considered 'the obvious' proof? To show $\pi$ is a submersion, we must show that for each $p\in E$, the differential $d\pi_p:T_pE\rightarrow T_{\pi(p)}M$ is surjective. Since, $(E,\pi,M,F)$ is a fiber bundle, there exists a neighbourhood $U\subseteq M$ containing $\pi(p)$ and diffeomorphism $\phi:\pi^{-1}(U)\rightarrow U\times F$ , such that $\pi|_{\pi^{-1}(U)}=\pi_1\circ \phi:\pi^{-1}(U)\rightarrow U$. Thus, showing $d\pi_p$ is surjective is equivalent to showing $d(\pi_1\circ \phi)_p={d\pi_1}_{\phi(p)}\circ d\phi_p$ is surjective. Since $\phi$ is a diffeomorphism, $d\phi_{p}$ is an isomorphism, so it is surjective. Furthermore, ${d\pi_1}_{\phi(p)}$ is surjective since projection onto the first factor is a submersion. Since the composition of two surjections is a surjection itself, it follows that ${d\pi_1}_{\phi(p)}\circ d\phi_p=d\pi_p$ is surjective.

72,Can an equilateral triangle be dissected into 5 congruent convex pieces?,Can an equilateral triangle be dissected into 5 congruent convex pieces?,,"There is a rather surprising dissection of an equilateral triangle into 5 congruent pieces: However, these pieces aren't very ""nice"", consisting of 2 or 6 connected components depending on how one counts single-point overlaps. I expect that the analogous question for arbitrary connected pieces is quite difficult, but I wonder if the case of convex pieces is sufficiently restricted to allow for a proof of impossibility (which I strongly suspect is the case). One aspect of this problem that makes it much more tractable is that the pieces have to be polygons, because any border between two pieces must be a straight line to preserve convexity of both pieces. In fact, this analysis can be extended a little further to show that the pieces have at most 5 sides. The number of edges on a piece is at most the number of edges of the triangle it touches, plus the number of other pieces it touches. $K_5$ is non-planar, so there is a piece touching at most 3 others. If this piece touches all three sides of the triangle, then its complement has at least two disconnected regions (since it can't take up an entire side), so the pieces in those regions are at most pentagons by a similar analysis. If it does not touch all three sides of the triangle, then it is itself at most a pentagon. If the polygons are triangles, then I can go through some casework on the edges to show that the triangles must be $30-60-90$ triangles, and from there derive a contradiction. So the only remaining cases are those of quadrilaterals and pentagons. Can such dissections be shown impossible? Interestingly, the answer is known to be yes for some squarefree multiples of $5$ like $180$ ; see this MathOverflow thread for a picture.","There is a rather surprising dissection of an equilateral triangle into 5 congruent pieces: However, these pieces aren't very ""nice"", consisting of 2 or 6 connected components depending on how one counts single-point overlaps.

I'm attaching a picture of my best findings, intentionally left handmade to show the kind of result I'm pursuing (following an answer I introduced a couple of digital adjustments). Explanations follow below. Let me start with regular polygons. The rule is simple: the vertices must lie at the grid crossings, that is their coordinates must be expressible as integer numbers. Apart from the square, it is not possible to get regular polygons with this restriction, so the intent is to obtain the closest approximations keeping the figures ""small"". I've explored different ways to quantitatively assess the ""precision"" of an approximation, starting from length uniformity of sides (satisfactory only for triangles) later combined with uniformity of angles, to the mean squared distance of vertices from the ideal ones not lying on the grid. I put no requirements about the center; should it happen to fall on or close to a crossing, even better. Moreover I tested different size factors to take into account the fact that getting better shape approximations with bigger figures is somewhat obvious and also less useful for sketching. Anyway I've found substantial agreement among different strategies. In fact, I didn't really find head-to-head confrontations whose ""winner"" depended on the scoring details, and even if I did I would have happily declared a tie and kept all the alternatives. So, the sheet of paper in the top-left corner of the figure collects my best results of this family. Next I'm relaxing the restriction: I'll let the vertices fall also on the middle points of the sides of paper squares. These can be located with satisfactory precision by eye, instead I'm not going to allow center points of paper squares. This new rule is equivalent to halving all the coordinates of a valid previous solution, provided that no point had both coordinates odd (one can horizontally and/or vertically translate the original figure by $1$ before attempting the division). I might also add that I don't like to see a line running parallel to the grid cutting squares in halves, but it's just a matter of taste. Obviously, at comparable dimensions, better approximations can be found with this additional freedom, and my best findings are represented in the top-right corner. I shall proceed to circles. They are different, in that they do not have a limited number of vertices and one can look for support points –that now can belong to the circle and lie exactly at grid intersections at the same time– with no a priori restrictions of position and amount.

Again I'm trying to keep the circles small, with similar considerations as before about loss of interest as size grows. With this in mind, my best circles are depicted in the bottom-left corner. Finally, again I soften the rules: support points on the grid can be approximations of exact circle points and/or they can be placed on middle points of square sides.

74,How to determine that a surface is symmetric?,How to determine that a surface is symmetric?,,"Given a surface $f(x,y,z)=0$, how could you determine that it's symmetric about some plane, and, if so, how would you find this plane. The special case where $f$ is a polynomial is of some interest. The question is somewhat related to this one: How to identify surfaces of revolution Here's a simple 2D example to experiment with: $$ 27 x^3 + 108 x^2 y + 144 x y^2 + 64 y^3          - 80 x^2 + 120 x y  -   45 y^2 - 200 x   + 150 y - 125 = 0$$ This one is symmetric, as the following picture suggests: In fact, if we do the translation/rotation described by the substitution $u = \tfrac15(3x+4y)$, $v = \tfrac15(4x−3y) + 1$, then the curve is just $u^3 - v^2 = 0$, which is obviously symmetric about the line $v=0$. But how would you discover this translation/rotation if I didn't tell you, and how would you do similar things in the 3D surface case? Added after a few days of thought: We can consider the surface as an object made of thin sheet metal. As such, it has a center of mass, provided it's bounded, and any plane(s) of symmetry must pass though this center of mass. The plane then has only two remained degrees of freedom, so may be easier to find. The same sort of reasoning applies in the case of a bounded 2D curve. Again, any line of symmetry must pass through the curve's centroid, so it has only one remaining degree of freedom, namely its slope/angle. For curves and surfaces given by implicit equations, I don't really know how to calculate centroids, but I expect this can be done. Fabricated from Comments Below: Several people suggested looking at highest-degree terms only. So, in my example, we just look at the equation $$ 27 x^3 + 108 x^2 y + 144 x y^2 + 64 y^3 = 0 $$ Putting $w = y/x$, this is roughly equivalent to $$ 64w^3 + 144w^2 + 108 w + 27 = 0 $$ But the polynomial on the left is just $(4w + 3)^3$, so we have a root $w = -3/4$, with multiplicity three. Is the repeated root an accident that happens only in this case, or will it always happen?? Anyway, the vector $(-4,3)$ gives us the normal to the line of symmetry, and that surely can not be an accident. I don't really understand why this magic process works, but it looks very promising for the 2D curve case.

Fig. 1 Fig. 2 Fig. 3 I had already seen this kind of tessellation, and I met it again in a recent question on this site ( Tiling of regular polygon by rhombuses ). Let the polygon be $n$ -sided with $n$ even. The starlike pattern of rhombii issued from the rightmost point, that we will call the source, can be seen as successive ''layers'' of similar rhombii. A first layer $R_1$ with the most acute angles (they are $m:=\dfrac{n}{2}-1$ of them), then moving away from the source, a second layer $R_2$ with $m-1$ rhombii, etc. with a grand total of $\dfrac{m(m+1)}{2}$ rhombii. It is not difficult to show that rhombii in layer $R_p$ are characterized by angles $p\dfrac{\pi}{m+1}.$ In fact (I had no idea of it at first), the rhombii pattern described above is much less mysterious when seen into a larger structure such as shown in figure 4. The generation process is simple: a regular polygon with $m$ sides is rotated by successive rotations with angle $\dfrac{\pi}{m+1}$ around one of its vertices. Fig. 4 My question about this tessellation is twofold: where can I find some references? are there known properties/applications? The different figures have been produced by Matlab programs. The program that has generated Fig. 2 is given below ; it uses complex numbers, especially apt to render angular relationships: hold on;axis equal  m=9;n=2*m+2;  i=complex(0,1);pri=exp(2*i*pi/n);  v=pri.^(0:(n-1));  for k=0:m-1     z=1-(pri^k)*(1-v(1:m+2-k));     plot([z,NaN,conj(z)],'color',rand(1,3),'linewidth',5);  end; Edit : I am indebted to @Ethan Bolker for attracting my attention to zonohedra (or zomes, as some architects call them), a 3D extension of Fig. 4 (or an equivalent one with less or more circles) ; by 3D extension, we mean a polyhedron made of (planar) rhombic facets whose projection on $xOy$ plane is the initial figure, as shown on Fig. 5. The idea is simple (we refer here to the two left figures in Fig. 6): the central red ""layer"" (with the thinnest rhombi) is ""lifted"" as an umbrella whose highest point, the apex of the zonohedra, say at height $z=1$ , with the bottom of the $n$ ribs of the umbrella at $z=1-a$ . Let us denote by $V_k, \ k=1, \cdots n$ with components $\left(\cos(\tfrac{2 \pi k}{n}),\sin(\tfrac{2 \pi k}{n}), -a\right)$ the (3D) vectors issued from the apex. Layer $1$ rhombi have sides $V_k$ and $V_{k+1}$ ; by the very definition of a rhombus, layer $2$ (yellow) rhombi have sides $V_k$ and $V_{k+2}$ , etc. Note that Fig. 6, unlike Fig. 5,  displays a closed zonohedron obtained by gluing 2 identical zonohedra. The right part of Fig. 6 displays the same zonohedron colored in a spiraling way. Let us remark that there is a degree of freedom, i.e., the way the initial ""umbrella"" with ribs $V_k$ is more or less open, i.e., $a$ can be chosen.

A zonohedron can be ""decomposed"" as a sum of (hyper) parallelepipeds, giving a way to compute its volume ( https://mathoverflow.net/q/349558 )","A regular polygon with an even number of vertices can be tessellated by rhombii (or lozenges), all with the same sidelength, with angles in arithmetic progression as can be seen on figures 1 to 3. Fig. 1 Fig. 2 Fig. 3 I had already seen this kind of tessellation, and I met it again in a recent question on this site ( Tiling of regular polygon by rhombuses ). Let the polygon be -sided with even. The starlike pattern of rhombii issued from the rightmost point, that we will call the source, can be seen as successive ''layers'' of similar rhombii. A first layer with the most acute angles (they are of them), then moving away from the source, a second layer with rhombii, etc. with a grand total of rhombii. It is not difficult to show that rhombii in layer are characterized by angles In fact (I had no idea of it at first), the rhombii pattern described above is much less mysterious when seen into a larger structure such as shown in figure 4. The generation process is simple: a regular polygon with sides is rotated by successive rotations with angle around one of its vertices. Fig. 4 My question about this tessellation is twofold: where can I find some references? are there known properties/applications? The different figures have been produced by Matlab programs. The program that has generated Fig. 2 is given below ; it uses complex numbers, especially apt to render angular relationships: hold on;axis equal  m=9;n=2*m+2;  i=complex(0,1);pri=exp(2*i*pi/n);  v=pri.^(0:(n-1));  for k=0:m-1     z=1-(pri^k)*(1-v(1:m+2-k));     plot([z,NaN,conj(z)],'color',rand(1,3),'linewidth',5);  end; Edit : I am indebted to @Ethan Bolker for attracting my attention to zonohedra (or zomes, as some architects call them), a 3D extension of Fig. 4 (or an equivalent one with less or more circles) ; by 3D extension, we mean a polyhedron made of (planar) rhombic facets whose projection on plane is the initial figure, as shown on Fig. 5. The idea is simple (we refer here to the two left figures in Fig. 6): the central red ""layer"" (with the thinnest rhombi) is ""lifted"" as an umbrella whose highest point, the apex of the zonohedra, say at height , with the bottom of the ribs of the umbrella at . Let us denote by with components the (3D) vectors issued from the apex. Layer rhombi have sides and ; by the very definition of a rhombus, layer (yellow) rhombi have sides and , etc. Note that Fig. 6, unlike Fig. 5,  displays a closed zonohedron obtained by gluing 2 identical zonohedra. The right part of Fig. 6 displays the same zonohedron colored in a spiraling way. Let us remark that there is a degree of freedom, i.e., the way the initial ""umbrella"" with ribs is more or less open, i.e., can be chosen.

81,"If two convex polygons tile the plane, how many sides can one of them have?","If two convex polygons tile the plane, how many sides can one of them have?",,"The set of convex polygons which tile the plane is, as of $2017$ , known: it consists of all triangles, all quadrilaterals, $15$ families of pentagons , and three families of hexagons . Euler's formula rules out strictly convex $n$ -gons with $n\ge 7$ . (The pentagonal case is by far the most difficult one.) I am interested in pairs of convex polygons that can collectively tile the plane. Specifically, I am curious how many sides can be in a polygon which is part of such a tiling. Here are some conditions to impose on such a tiling, from weakest to strongest: There is at least one copy of each tile. (Without this condition, one can trivially take a pair consisting of a tiling polygon and any other convex polygon, and just never use the latter shape.) There are at least $k$ copies of each tile. There are infinitely many of each tile. Every tile borders a tile of the other type. The tiling is $2$ -isohedral, i.e., every tile can be carried to any other tile of the same shape by a symmetry of the tiling. Each of these conditions implies those above it. In the weakest case, the number of sides is unbounded, as exhibited by the following example: (The tiling is constructed by decomposing ""wedges"" of central angle $2\pi/N$ into congruent isosceles triangles, and then combining the central triangles to yield an $N$ -gon in the center.) Requiring at least $k$ of each tile still yields arbitrarily high numbers of sides, by taking the above construction for $N=M\cdot k$ and subdividing the $N$ -gon into $k$ ""wedges"" which are $(M+2)$ -gonal. On the other end of the spectrum, I have found a $2$ -isohedral tiling using regular $18$ -gons, shown below: After consulting this paper , it seems that the tiling pictured above is of type $4_2 18_{12}-1\text{a}\ \text{MN}\ \text{p}6\text{m}$ in their classification scheme (shown at the bottom of page 109); there are no $2$ -isohedral tilings which allow for any higher number of contacts between different shapes, although type $3_1 18_{12}-1\text{a}\ \text{MN}\ \text{p}6\text{m}$ also works (and can be obtained from the above construction by cutting each kite-shaped tile in two). Thus, it is maximal among $2$ -isohedral tilings. What are the maximal tilings under weaker conditions? The maximal number of sides under each successively stronger restriction is a weakly decreasing sequence which goes $\infty, \infty, ?, ?, 18$ . So far, I have no bounds on the missing two terms except that they are each at least $18$ . Some notes on this problem: It is not necessarily the case that one of the tiles may tile the plane on its own; see this math.SE question for a counterexample. If convexity is relaxed for either piece, the number of sides is unbounded even in the $2$ -isohedral case (in fact, both pieces can simultaneously have arbitrarily many sides).

Attempt: I only know one formal definition of $e$ that is $\lim_\limits{n\to\infty} (1+\frac{1}{n})^n=e$. I could somehow understand that this is somehow related to rotation in the complex plane. $$e^{i\theta}=\cos \theta + i \sin \theta$$ Hence we have $$e^{i\pi}=-1$$ But how can I bring out the value of $e$ when I am showing this rotation in a geometrical figure? Any hints are appreciated. EDIT: As per the comments, I am making a small addition to the question which will not affect the existing answers. It is that, as a definition of $e$, one can use any definition which does not use the fact $2<e<3$.","Q: Prove that $e>2$ geometrically.

92,What is the name of this curve?,What is the name of this curve?,,"When I was a kid I used to draw this shape below but today I came against it as a problem. I don't know the name of this red curve below.  It is enough to say the name if it is a known curve. I will search for it's properties. The shape is constructed with lines from point $(0,n)$ to $(8-(n-1),0)$ and the curves passes through the intersection of each two lines. In contrast to the figure, the red curve never crosses the axes. $n=0,1,...,9$ however the shape does not need to be discrete, hence $n$ can go to $0$. Probably the values on the axes are not important to know the name of the curve.","When I was a kid I used to draw this shape below but today I came against it as a problem.

The motivation for me to ask this question is that the textbook we use in our geometry class discusses only smooth curves on bounded open intervals. While I know that the curvature $\gamma''$ can be zero on a point (for instance: $\gamma(t)=(t,\sin t)$ has zero curvature on $\{n\pi:n\in\mathbb{Z}\}$ ), I can not come up with an example of a smooth curve $\gamma$ such that $\gamma''$ is $0$ on some interval $(a,b)$ .
