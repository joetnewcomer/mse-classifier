1,Constructing a rational function from its asymptotes,Constructing a rational function from its asymptotes,,"Question: Give an example of a rational function that has vertical asymptote $x=3$ now give an example of one that has vertical asymptote $x=3$ and horizontal asymptote $y=2$. Now give an example of a rational function with vertical asymptotes $x=1$ and $x=-1$, horizontal asymptote $y=0$ and x-intercept 4. My solution: $(a) \frac{1}{(x-3)}$. This is because when we find vertical asymptote(s) of a function, we find out the value where the denominator is $0$ because then the equation will be of a vertical line for its slope will be undefined. $(b) \frac{2x}{(x-3)}$. Same reasoning for vertical asymptote, but for horizontal asymptote, when the degree of the denominator and the numerator is the same, we divide the coefficient of the leading term in the numerator with that in the denominator, in this case $\frac{2}{1} = 2$ $(c) \frac{(x-4)}{(x-1)(x+1)}$. Same reasoning for vertical asymptote. Horizontal asymptote will be $y=0$ as the degree of the numerator is less than that of the denominator and x-intercept will be 4 as to get intercept, we have to make $y$, that is, $f(x)=0$ and hence, make the numerator 0.

My main probloem so far has been that literally every single online resource Ive found always appears to leave out critically important descriptions of parts of the function, assuming that the reader will just know everything that is being talked about, so Im left with a large collection of incomplete descriptions - very frustrating!

It’s been several years since I’ve done anything beyond basic algebra, derivatives and matrix operations, but (with the help of Google), I remember the basic function transformations ( $af(x - h) + v$ ). However, these do not seem to help much, as I’m still having trouble coming up with a formula such that the output scales appropriately. All of my attempts involved starting with a “basic” function which has a similar shape to what I’d like ( $\ln(x)$ , $\sqrt x$ , $1/x$ , etc.), then applying transforms in an attempt to make it play nice. When that didn’t work, I tried using an exponential to get a function that grows up to (roughly) my maximum ( $\max \times (1 - e^{-x})$ ).

Edit: A simple example that might help express my intent: The function in question is to be used for a bonus reward to be given to a player as they build a chain of “kills” or victories. I expect players to easily build chains around 1-10 without much effort, so I want there to be some noticeable growth to show the player that longer chains $=$ higher reward. At chains of around 60-80 is where I’d like to see the reward maximize. The problem (and why I’ve not stated these values up to now) is that certain victories aren’t worth as much as others, to prevent players from beating on weaker players for easy rewards. So their chain is expressed with a point system: That 1-10 chain will be somewhere around 80-120 points, and the 60-80 chains will be around 550-750.

At first I was thinking that maybe the numbers are being added together like this: $1 + 1 = 2$ for $S(2)$ and then $2 + 1 = 3$ for $S(3)$, but if that is the case then I would have $3 + 2 = 5$ but there is no $S(5)$. Thanks for any help you can provide. Tony","I am trying to understand this exercise. Define $S : \mathbb{Z}^+ \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}^+$ by the rule: For all integers $n$, $S(n) =$ the sum of the positive divisors of $n$. a. Is $S$ one-to-one? The answer is no. Counterexample: $S(6) = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6$ and $S(11) = 1 + 11 = 12, so S(6) = S(11)$ but $6 \neq 11$. In this one I understand that I need to choose any positive integer and show that there are different sets of positive integers that when added together will both equal the same number. i.e. $12$ in this case. But, I am not sure what $S : \mathbb{Z}^+ \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}^+$ has to do with the answer. b. Is $S$ onto? No.  Counterexample: In order for there to be a positive integer $n$ such that $S(n) = 5$, $n$ would have to be $< 5$. But $S(1) = 1$, $S(2) = 3$, $S(3) = 4$, $S(4) = 7$. Hence there is no positive integer $n$ such that $S(n) = 5$. I do not understand how $S(1) = 1$, $S(2) = 3$, $S(3) = 4$, $S(4) = 7$ is derived? Are they just arbitrarily chosen?
