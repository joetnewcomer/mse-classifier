11,What does Big O actually tell you?,What does Big O actually tell you?,,"Two days ago I felt very uncomfortable with Big O notation. I've already asked two questions: Why to calculate ""Big O"" if we can just calculate number of steps? The main idea behind Big O notation And now almost everything has become clear. But there are few questions that I still can't understand: Suppose we have an algorithm that runs in $1000n$ steps. Why people say that $1000$ coefficient becomes insignificant when $n$ gets really large (and that's why we can throw it away)? This really confuses me because no matter how large $n$ is but $1000n$ is going to be $1000$ times bigger than $n$ . And this is very significant (in my head). Any examples why it is considered insignificant as $n$ tends to infinity would be appreciated. Why Big O is told to estimate running time in worst case? Given running time $O(n)$ , how is it considered to be worst case behavior? I mean in this case we think that our algorithm is not slower than $n$ , right? But in reality the actual running time could be $1000n$ and it is indeed slower than $n$ . According to the definition, Big O gives us a scaled upper bound of $f$ as $n \to +\infty$ , where $f$ is our function of time. But how do we interpret it? I mean, given algorithm running in $O(n)$ , we will never be able to calculate the actual number of steps this algorithm takes. We just know that if we double the size of the input, we double the computation time as well, right? But if that $O(n)$ algorithm really takes $1000n$ steps then we also need to multiply the size of the input by $1000$ to be able to visualise how it grows, because $1000n$ and $n$ have very different slopes. Thus in this case if you just double the computation time for the doubled size of the input, you're going to get wrong idea about how the running time grows, right? So how then do you visualise its growth rate? I want to add that I know the definition of Big O and how to calculate it, so there is no need in explaining it. Also I've already googled all these questions tons of times and no luck. I'm learning calculus at the moment, so I hope I asked this question in the right place. Thank you in advance!","Two days ago I felt very uncomfortable with Big O notation. I've already asked two questions: Why to calculate ""Big O"" if we can just calculate number of steps? The main idea behind Big O notation And now almost everything has become clear. But there are few questions that I still can't understand: Suppose we have an algorithm that runs in steps. Why people say that coefficient becomes insignificant when gets really large (and that's why we can throw it away)? This really confuses me because no matter how large is but is going to be times bigger than . And this is very significant (in my head). Any examples why it is considered insignificant as tends to infinity would be appreciated. Why Big O is told to estimate running time in worst case? Given running time , how is it considered to be worst case behavior? I mean in this case we think that our algorithm is not slower than , right? But in reality the actual running time could be and it is indeed slower than . According to the definition, Big O gives us a scaled upper bound of as , where is our function of time.

This fact is used in some proofs of Farkas's lemma.  It seems like it should be easy, but the proof I've seen seems to be unexpectedly complicated.  Is there a very clear / easy / obvious proof of this fact? (Note that linear transformations do not always map closed sets to closed sets, as discussed in this question .  For example, let $S = \{ (x,y) \in \mathbb R^2 \mid y \geq e^x \}$ and let $T:\mathbb R^2 \to \mathbb R^2$ such that $T(x,y) = (0,y)$.  Then $S$ is closed, but $T(S)$ is not closed.)

The equations of the graph: Using rotation matrix, as mentioned in Yuriy S's answer, Define a paremeter $a$ , as the rotation degree measures in radian (clockwise), $f$ , after rotation, is $$\left|x\cdot\cos a-y\sin a\right|^{x\cdot\cos a-y\sin a}=\left|x\sin a+y\cos a\right|^{x\sin a+y\cos a}$$ For $$\space x\cdot\cos a-y\sin a\neq x\sin a+y\cos a$$ Of course, there are two points more. Does it helps to prove that $f$ is continuous, i.e., question 2 above?

29,"What are ways to compute polynomials that converge from above and below to a continuous and bounded function on $[0,1]$?",What are ways to compute polynomials that converge from above and below to a continuous and bounded function on ?,"[0,1]","Main Question Suppose $f:[0,1]\to [0,1]$ is continuous and belongs to a large class of functions (for example, the $k$ -th derivative, $k\ge 0$ , is continuous, Lipschitz continuous, concave, strictly increasing, bounded variation, and/or in the Zygmund class, or $f$ is real analytic). Then, compute the Bernstein coefficients of a sequence of polynomials ( $g_n$ ) of degree 2, 4, 8, ..., $2^i$ , ... that converge to $f$ from below and satisfy: $(g_{2n}-g_{n})$ is a polynomial with non-negative Bernstein coefficients once it's rewritten to a polynomial in Bernstein form of degree exactly $2n$ . Assume $0\lt f(\lambda)\lt 1$ or $f$ is polynomially bounded. The convergence rate must be $O(1/n^{r/2})$ if the class has only functions with Lipschitz-continuous $(r-1)$ -th derivative.  The method may not introduce transcendental or trigonometric functions (as with Chebyshev interpolants). See ""Strategies"", below, for different ways to answer this question. In this question, a polynomial $P(x)$ is written in Bernstein form of degree $n$ if it is written as— $$P(x)=\sum_{k=0}^n a_k {n \choose k} x^k (1-x)^{n-k},$$ where $a_0, ..., a_n$ are the polynomial's Bernstein coefficients . The degree- $n$ Bernstein polynomial of an arbitrary function $f(x)$ has Bernstein coefficients $a_k = f(k/n)$ .  In general, this Bernstein polynomial differs from $f$ even if $f$ is a polynomial. Background I asked this question in order to solve the so-called Bernoulli factory problem , described next. We're given a coin that shows heads with an unknown probability, $\lambda$ . The goal is to use that coin (and possibly also a fair coin) to build a ""new"" coin that shows heads with a probability that depends on $\lambda$ , call it $f(\lambda)$ . This is the Bernoulli factory problem , and it can be solved only if $f$ is continuous (Keane and O'Brien 1994). However, since I asked this question I have found a Bernoulli factory algorithm that I believe is general enough to cover all the cases that this question would help solve. Since this question may be of broader interest, though, I leave this question open.  See also my other open questions about the Bernoulli factory problem. Polynomials that approach a factory function An algorithm simulates a factory function $f(\lambda)$ via two sequences of polynomials that converge from above and below to that function.  To use the algorithm, however, the polynomial sequences must meet certain requirements; among them, the sequences must be of Bernstein-form polynomials that converge from above and below to a factory function.  Specifically: For $f(\lambda)$ there must be a sequence of polynomials ( $g_n$ ) in Bernstein form of degree 1, 2, 3, ... that converge to $f$ from below and satisfy: $(g_{n+1}-g_{n})$ is a polynomial with non-negative Bernstein coefficients once it's rewritten to a polynomial in Bernstein form of degree exactly $n+1$ ( see end notes ; Nacu and Peres 2005; Holtz et al. 2011).  For $f(\lambda)=1-f(\lambda)$ there must likewise be a sequence of this kind. A Matter of Efficiency However, ordinary Bernstein polynomials converge to a function at the rate $\Omega(1/n)$ in general, a result known since Voronovskaya (1932) and a rate that will lead to an infinite expected number of coin flips in general .  (See also my supplemental notes .) But Lorentz (1966) showed that if the function is positive and has a continuous $k$ -th derivative, there are polynomials with nonnegative Bernstein coefficients that converge at the rate $O(1/n^{k/2})$ (and thus can enable a finite expected number of coin flips if the function is ""smooth"" enough). Thus, people have developed alternatives, including linear combinations and iterated Boolean sums of Bernstein polynomials, to improve the convergence rate. These include Micchelli (1973), Guan (2009), Güntürk and Li (2021a, 2021b), the ""Lorentz operator"" in Holtz et al. (2011), Draganov (2014), and Tachev (2022). These alternative polynomials usually include results where the error bound is the desired $O(1/n^{k/2})$ , but nearly all those results (e.g., Theorem 4.4 in Micchelli; Theorem 5 in Güntürk and Li) have hidden constants with no upper bounds given, making them unimplementable (that is, it can't be known beforehand whether a given polynomial will come close to the target function within a user-specified error tolerance). (See end notes.) A Conjecture on Polynomial Approximation The following is a conjecture that could help reduce this problem to the problem of finding explicit error bounds when approximating a function by polynomials. Let $f(\lambda):[0,1]\to(0,1)$ have $r\ge 1$ continuous derivatives, let $M$ be the maximum of the absolute value of $f$ and its derivatives up to the $r$ -th derivative, and denote the Bernstein polynomial of degree $n$ of a function $g$ as $B_n(g)$ . Let $W_{2^0}(\lambda), W_{2^1}(\lambda), ..., W_{2^i}(\lambda),...$ be a sequence of functions on [0, 1] that converge uniformly to $f$ . For each integer $n\ge 1$ that's a power of 2, suppose that there is $D>0$ such that— $$|f(\lambda)-B_n(W_n(\lambda))| \le DM/n^{r/2},$$ whenever $0\le \lambda\le 1$ .  Then there is $C_0\ge D$ such that for every $C\ge C_0$ , the polynomials $(g_n)$ in Bernstein form of degree 2, 4, 8, ..., $2^i$ , ..., defined as $g_n=B_n(W_n(\lambda) - CM/n^{r/2})$ , converge from below to $f$ and satisfy: $(g_{2n}-g_{n})$ is a polynomial with non-negative Bernstein coefficients once it's rewritten to a polynomial in Bernstein form of degree exactly $2n$ . (See end notes.) Equivalently (see also Nacu and Peres 2005), there is $C_1>0$ such that the inequality $(PB)$ (see below) holds true for each integer $n\ge 1$ that's a power of 2 (see ""Strategies"", below). My goal is to see not just whether this conjecture is true, but also which value of $C_0$ (or $C_1$ ) suffices for the conjecture, especially for any combination of the special cases mentioned at the end of "" Main Question "", above. Strategies The following are some strategies for answering these questions: For iterated Boolean sums of Bernstein polynomials ( $U_{n,k}$ in Micchelli 1973 ; see also Güntürk and Li ), find an explicit bound, with no hidden constants, on the approximation error for functions with continuous $r$ -th derivative, or verify my proof of those error bounds . For linear combinations of Bernstein polynomials (Butzer 1953, Tachev 2022 ), verify my proof of those error bounds in my Proposition B10 . For the "" Lorentz operator "", find an explicit bound, with no hidden constants, on the approximation error for the operator $Q_{n,r}$ and for the polynomials $(f_n)$ and $(g_n)$ formed with it, and find the hidden constants $\theta_\alpha$ , $s$ , and $D$ as well as those in Lemmas 15, 17 to 22, and 24 in the paper.  Or verify my proof of the order-2 operator's error bounds in my Proposition B10A . Find other polynomial operators meeting the requirements of the main question (see ""Main Question"", above) and having explicit error bounds, with no hidden constants, especially operators that preserve polynomials of a higher degree than linear functions. Find a sequence of functions $(W_n(f))$ and an explicit and tight upper bound on $C_1>0$ such that, for each integer $n\ge 1$ that's a power of 2— $$\left|\left(\sum_{i=0}^k W_n\left(\frac{i}{n}\right)\sigma_{n,k,i}\right)-W_{2n}\left(\frac{k}{2n}\right)\right|=|\mathbb{E}[W_n(X_k/n)] - W_{2n}(\mathbb{E}[X_k/n])|\le \frac{C_1 M}{n^{r/2}},\tag{PB}$$ whenever $0\le k\le 2n$ , where $M = \max(L, \max|f^{(0)}|, ...,\max|f^{(r-1)}|)$ , $L$ is $\max|f^{(r)}|$ or the Lipschitz constant of $f^{(r-1)}$ , $X_k$ is a hypergeometric( $2n$ , $k$ , $n$ ) random variable, and $\sigma_{n,k,i} = {n\choose i}{n\choose {k-i}}/{2n \choose k}=\mathbb{P}(X_k=i)$ is the probability that $X_k$ equals $i$ .

Note 5 : This condition is also known as a ""consistency requirement""; it ensures that not only the polynomials ""increase"" to $f(\lambda)$ , but also their Bernstein coefficients do as well.  This condition is equivalent in practice to the following statement (Nacu & Peres 2005). For every integer $n\ge 1$ that's a power of 2, $a(2n, k)\ge\mathbb{E}[a(n, X_{n,k})]= \left(\sum_{i=0}^k a(n,i) {n\choose i}{n\choose {k-i}}/{2n\choose k}\right)$ , where $a(n,k)$ is the degree- $n$ polynomial's $k$ -th Bernstein coefficient, where $0\le k\le 2n$ is an integer, and where $X_{n,k}$ is a hypergeometric( $2n$ , $k$ , $n$ ) random variable.  A hypergeometric( $2n$ , $k$ , $n$ ) random variable is the number of ""good"" balls out of $n$ balls taken uniformly at random, all at once, from a bag containing $2n$ balls, $k$ of which are ""good"".  See also my MathOverflow question on finding bounds for hypergeometric variables. Note 6 : If $W_n(0)=f(0)$ and $W_n(1)=f(1)$ for every $n$ , then the inequality $(PB)$ is automatically true when $k=0$ and $k=2n$ , so that the statement has to be checked only for $0\lt k\lt 2n$ .  If, in addition, $W_n$ is symmetric about 1/2, so that $W_n(\lambda)=W_n(1-\lambda)$ whenever $0\le \lambda\le 1$ , then the statement has to be checked only for $0\lt k\le n$ (since the values $\sigma_{n,k,i} = {n\choose i}{n\choose {k-i}}/{2n \choose k}$ are symmetric in that they satisfy $\sigma_{n,k,i}=\sigma_{n,k,k-i}$ ). This question is a problem of finding the Jensen gap of $W_n$ for certain kinds of hypergeometric random variables ( see Note 5 ).  Lee et al. (2021) deal with a problem very similar to this one and find results that take advantage of $f$ 's (here, $W_n$ 's) smoothness, but unfortunately assume the variable is supported on an open interval, rather than a closed one (namely $[0,1]$ ) as in this question.","Main Question Suppose is continuous and belongs to a large class of functions (for example, the -th derivative, , is continuous, Lipschitz continuous, concave, strictly increasing, bounded variation, and/or in the Zygmund class, or is real analytic).

These alternative polynomials usually include results where the error bound is the desired , but nearly all those results (e.g., Theorem 4.4 in Micchelli; Theorem 5 in Güntürk and Li) have hidden constants with no upper bounds given, making them unimplementable (that is, it can't be known beforehand whether a given polynomial will come close to the target function within a user-specified error tolerance). (See end notes.) A Conjecture on Polynomial Approximation The following is a conjecture that could help reduce this problem to the problem of finding explicit error bounds when approximating a function by polynomials. Let have continuous derivatives, let be the maximum of the absolute value of and its derivatives up to the -th derivative, and denote the Bernstein polynomial of degree of a function as . Let be a sequence of functions on [0, 1] that converge uniformly to . For each integer that's a power of 2, suppose that there is such that— whenever .  Then there is such that for every , the polynomials in Bernstein form of degree 2, 4, 8, ..., , ..., defined as , converge from below to and satisfy: is a polynomial with non-negative Bernstein coefficients once it's rewritten to a polynomial in Bernstein form of degree exactly . (See end notes.) Equivalently (see also Nacu and Peres 2005), there is such that the inequality (see below) holds true for each integer that's a power of 2 (see ""Strategies"", below). My goal is to see not just whether this conjecture is true, but also which value of (or ) suffices for the conjecture, especially for any combination of the special cases mentioned at the end of "" Main Question "", above. Strategies The following are some strategies for answering these questions: For iterated Boolean sums of Bernstein polynomials ( in Micchelli 1973 ; see also Güntürk and Li ), find an explicit bound, with no hidden constants, on the approximation error for functions with continuous -th derivative, or verify my proof of those error bounds . For linear combinations of Bernstein polynomials (Butzer 1953, Tachev 2022 ), verify my proof of those error bounds in my Proposition B10 . For the "" Lorentz operator "", find an explicit bound, with no hidden constants, on the approximation error for the operator and for the polynomials and formed with it, and find the hidden constants , , and as well as those in Lemmas 15, 17 to 22, and 24 in the paper.  Or verify my proof of the order-2 operator's error bounds in my Proposition B10A . Find other polynomial operators meeting the requirements of the main question (see ""Main Question"", above) and having explicit error bounds, with no hidden constants, especially operators that preserve polynomials of a higher degree than linear functions. Find a sequence of functions and an explicit and tight upper bound on such that, for each integer that's a power of 2— whenever , where , is or the Lipschitz constant of , is a hypergeometric( , , ) random variable, and is the probability that equals .

51,What is the rigorous definition of $dy$ and $dx$?,What is the rigorous definition of  and ?,dy dx,"Some background: I am a third year undergrad. I have completed two courses on Real Analysis (I have studied $\epsilon$-$\delta$ definitions of limit, continuity, differentiability, Reimann integration and basic topology of $\mathbb{R}$). This semester I have enrolled in our first differential equation course. This is not the first time I am studying DE. In high school, we studied first-order ODE: separation of variables, homogenous DEs, linear first-order DEs and Bernoulli's differential equation. There was a common theme in solution of most of these DEs, the author would somehow manipulate the DE to arrive at an equation of the following form: $f(x)dx = g(y)dy$, then, they would integrate both sides to obtain the solution.  I never understood what the equation $f(x)dx = g(y)dy$ meant, since, the only place where we were introduced to the symbols $dx$ and $dy$ was the definition of derivative: $\dfrac{dy}{dx}$ and integraition $\int f(x)dx$. Note that in these definitions, neither $dx$ nor $dy$ occurs on its own separately, they either occur with each other (in the case of derivative) or with $\int f$ (in the case of integral). As a high school student, I was never satisfied with this way of solving DEs but I soon convinced myself that this was correct because it seemed impossible to solve certain DEs without abusing this notation. And, very often, the DEs would already be in the form containing $dx$ and $dy$ separately. Now, in the current course, I was expecting that we would be taught a mathematically rigorous way of solving DEs, but I was disappointed after reading first few sections in the recommended textbooks. The books are Simmons' Differential Equations with Applications and Historical Notes and Ross' Differential Equations . In section 7, Simmons writes: The simplest of the standard types is that in which the variables are separable:   $$\dfrac{dy}{dx} = g(x)h(y)$$As we know, to solve this we have only to write it in the separated form $dy/h(y) = g(x)dx$ and integrate ... Similarly, Ross also uses $dy$ and $dx$ freely without defining what they mean. In section 2.1, Ross writes: The first-order differential equations to be studied in this chapter may be expressed in either the derivative form $$\dfrac{dy}{dx} = f(x, y)$$ or the differential form $$M(x, y)dx + N(x, y)dy = 0$$ Thus, I would like to ask the following questions: What is the rigorous definition of $dx$ and $dy$? How do we conclude from $\dfrac{dy}{dx} = k$ that $dy = k dx ?$ Since, we integrate both sides after arriving at the form $f(x)dx = g(y)dy$, does it mean that $f(x)dx$ and $g(y)dy$ are integrable (possibly, Reimann) functions? If so, how do we show that? What does Ross mean by differential form ? Wikipedia gives me something related to differential geometry and multivariable calculus, what has that got to do with ODEs? Why do all authors don't care to define $dx$? I have seen undergrad texts on number theory which begin by defining divisibility, grad texts on Fourier analysis which define what Reimann integration means. And yet, we have introductory texts on ODEs which do not have enough content on something which to me appears to be one of the most common method to solve first-order ODEs. Why is this so? Do authors assume that the reader has already studied that in an earlier course? Should I have studied this in the Real Analysis course? Finally, is there any textbook which takes an axiomatic approach to solving DEs? I understand that some authors want to spend more time discussing motivation behind DEs: their origin in the physics, their applications in economics etc. But I believe I already have enough motivation to study DEs: in the first year I had to take classical mechanics, in which I studied many types DEs, including second-order DEs for harmonic oscillator and I also had to take quantum chemistry in which I studied PDEs like the classical wave equation and Schrodinger equation. In Terry Tao's language, I believe I am past the pre-rigorous phase of DEs, and what I expect from an undergrad course is an axiomatic treatment of the subject. What is a good textbook which serves this purpose? EDIT: I did go through a similar question . But I am not looking for a way to completely do away with the so called differentials $dx$ and $dy$, because, that would make solving certain DEs very difficult. Rather, I am looking for a rigorous theory, which formalizes operations like taking $dx$ to the other side and integrating both sides .","Some background: I am a third year undergrad.

I never understood what the equation $f(x)dx = g(y)dy$ meant, since, the only place where we were introduced to the symbols $dx$ and $dy$ was the definition of derivative: $\dfrac{dy}{dx}$ and integraition $\int f(x)dx$. Note that in these definitions, neither $dx$ nor $dy$ occurs on its own separately, they either occur with each other (in the case of derivative) or with $\int f$ (in the case of integral). As a high school student, I was never satisfied with this way of solving DEs but I soon convinced myself that this was correct because it seemed impossible to solve certain DEs without abusing this notation. And, very often, the DEs would already be in the form containing $dx$ and $dy$ separately. Now, in the current course, I was expecting that we would be taught a mathematically rigorous way of solving DEs, but I was disappointed after reading first few sections in the recommended textbooks. The books are Simmons' Differential Equations with Applications and Historical Notes and Ross' Differential Equations . In section 7, Simmons writes: The simplest of the standard types is that in which the variables are separable:   $$\dfrac{dy}{dx} = g(x)h(y)$$As we know, to solve this we have only to write it in the separated form $dy/h(y) = g(x)dx$ and integrate ... Similarly, Ross also uses $dy$ and $dx$ freely without defining what they mean. In section 2.1, Ross writes: The first-order differential equations to be studied in this chapter may be expressed in either the derivative form $$\dfrac{dy}{dx} = f(x, y)$$ or the differential form $$M(x, y)dx + N(x, y)dy = 0$$ Thus, I would like to ask the following questions: What is the rigorous definition of $dx$ and $dy$? How do we conclude from $\dfrac{dy}{dx} = k$ that $dy = k dx ?$ Since, we integrate both sides after arriving at the form $f(x)dx = g(y)dy$, does it mean that $f(x)dx$ and $g(y)dy$ are integrable (possibly, Reimann) functions? If so, how do we show that? What does Ross mean by differential form ? Wikipedia gives me something related to differential geometry and multivariable calculus, what has that got to do with ODEs? Why do all authors don't care to define $dx$? I have seen undergrad texts on number theory which begin by defining divisibility, grad texts on Fourier analysis which define what Reimann integration means. And yet, we have introductory texts on ODEs which do not have enough content on something which to me appears to be one of the most common method to solve first-order ODEs. Why is this so? Do authors assume that the reader has already studied that in an earlier course? Should I have studied this in the Real Analysis course? Finally, is there any textbook which takes an axiomatic approach to solving DEs? I understand that some authors want to spend more time discussing motivation behind DEs: their origin in the physics, their applications in economics etc. But I believe I already have enough motivation to study DEs: in the first year I had to take classical mechanics, in which I studied many types DEs, including second-order DEs for harmonic oscillator and I also had to take quantum chemistry in which I studied PDEs like the classical wave equation and Schrodinger equation. In Terry Tao's language, I believe I am past the pre-rigorous phase of DEs, and what I expect from an undergrad course is an axiomatic treatment of the subject. What is a good textbook which serves this purpose? EDIT: I did go through a similar question . But I am not looking for a way to completely do away with the so called differentials $dx$ and $dy$, because, that would make solving certain DEs very difficult. Rather, I am looking for a rigorous theory, which formalizes operations like taking $dx$ to the other side and integrating both sides .",,"['real-analysis', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'reference-request']"
52,"Infinite tetration, convergence radius","Infinite tetration, convergence radius",,"I got this problem from my teacher as a optional challenge. I am open about this being a given problem, however it is not homework. The problem is stated as follows. Assume we have an infinite tetration as follows $$x^{x^{x^{.^{.^.}}}} \, = \, a$$ With a given $a$ find $x$ . The next part of the problem was to discuss the convergence radius of a. If a is too big or too small the tetration does not converge. Below is my humble stab at the problem. My friend said you would have to treat the tetration as a infinite series, and therefore could not perform algebraic manipulations on it before it is know whether it converges or diverges. However my attempt is to first do some algebraic steps, then discuss the convergence radius. I) Initial discussion At the start it is obvious that the tetration converges when $a=1$ (just set $x=1$ ) Now after some computer hardwork it seems that the tetration fails to converge when a is roughly larger than 3. II) Algebraic manipulation $$ x^{x^{x^{.^{.^.}}}} \, = \, a$$ This is the same as $$ x^a \, = \, a$$ $$ \log_a(x^a) \, = \, \log_a(a)$$ $$ \log_a(x) \, = \, \frac{1}{a}$$ $$ x \, = \, a^{\frac{1}{a}}$$ Now, if we let $a=2$ then $x = \sqrt{2}$ . After some more computational work, this seems to be correct, which makes me believe this formula is correct. III) Discsussion about convergence By looking at the derivative of $ \displaystyle \large a^{\frac{1}{a}} $ we see that the maxima occurs when $a=e$ , which also seems to correspond to the inital computational work. Now I think, that the minima of $\displaystyle \large a^{1/a}$ is zero by looking at its graph, studying its derivative and the endpoints. So that my ""guess"" or work shows that it converges when $$ a \in [0 \, , \,  1/e] $$ VI) My questions Can my algebraic manipulations be justified? They seem rather sketchy taking the a`th logarithm and so on .

Here's my thought so far: Suppose that our coordinates transformation is given by $(\xi,\theta) = G(x,y) = (G_1(x,y),G_2(x,y))$ . By some calculation (that I shall skip), we can compute that the Laplacian $\Delta = \partial_x^2 + \partial_y^2$ in the coordinate $(\xi,\theta)$ can be written as $$ \partial_x^2 + \partial_y^2 = (\Delta G_1)\partial_\xi + (\Delta G_2)\partial_\theta + |\nabla G_1|^2 \partial_\xi^2 + |\nabla G_2|^2 \partial_\theta^2 + 2(\nabla G_1 \cdot \nabla G_2)\partial_\xi \partial_\theta, $$ hence $\partial_x^2 + \partial_y^2 = h(\partial_\xi^2 + \partial_\theta^2)$ if and only if $$ |\nabla G_1|^2 = |\nabla G_2|^2 = h, \quad \Delta G_1 = \Delta G_2 = 0, \quad \text{and}\quad \nabla G_1 \cdot \nabla G_2 = 0. $$ On the other hand, we have $$ \begin{pmatrix}\partial_x f &\partial_y f \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}\partial_\xi f &\partial_\theta f \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}\partial_x G_1 &\partial_y G_1 \\ \partial_x G_2 &\partial_y G_2 \end{pmatrix}, $$ hence in order that $(\partial_x f)^2 + (\partial_y f)^2 = h ((\partial_\xi f)^2 + (\partial_\theta f)^2 )$ , we need the Jacobian matrix to be of the form $$ \begin{pmatrix}\partial_x G_1 &\partial_y G_1 \\ \partial_x G_2 &\partial_y G_2 \end{pmatrix} = \sqrt{h}\ M, $$ where $M$ is an orthogonal matrix at each point on $D$ .

My proof (sketch) : We split into cases: i) $x \ge 1$ : Clearly, $x^{x^{x^{x^{x^x}}}}\ge x^x$ .

Second, let $f(x) = x^{7/12}\ln x - \ln \frac{x^2 + 1}{2}$ . We have \begin{align*} 	f'(x) &= \frac{7}{12x^{5/12}} 	\left(\ln x + \frac{12}{7} - \frac{24x^{17/12}}{7x^2 + 7}\right)\\ 	&\le \frac{7}{12x^{5/12}} 	\left(\frac{3x^2 - 3}{x^2 + 4x + 1} + \frac{12}{7} - \frac{24x^{17/12}}{7x^2 + 7}\right)\\ 	&\le 0 \tag{2} \end{align*} where we have used $\ln x \le \frac{3x^2 - 3}{x^2 + 4x + 1}$ for all $x$ in $(0, 1]$ . Also, $f(1) = 0$ . Thus, $f(x) \ge 0$ for all $x$ in $(0, 1)$ . Thus, the right inequality in (1) is true.

Here is a rough sketch of an attempt at proving that such a function does not exist: we could suppose a function satisfies these conditions.  Take an $\epsilon > 0$ and two points $x,y$ in this dense set such that $x<y$.  Then, $f(x)<f(y)$ because if they are equal, then the function is constant at all points in between, and there is another element of $X$ between $x$ and $y$, which would be a contradiction.  Take $f(y)-f(x)$.  By the Archimedean property of the reals, $f(y)-f(x)<n\epsilon$ for some $n$. However, after this point, I am stuck.  Could we somehow partition $(x,y)$ into $n$ subintervals and conclude that there must be some point on the dense set that is continuous?",,"['real-analysis', 'continuity']"

Is it necessary that $f(x) > 0$ almost everywhere? This is my attempt. It is easy to show that $f(x) \geq 0$ everywhere, so the real question is whether $f$ can be zero at an ""almost all"" irrational points. The function can become $0$ at isolated points, e.g., $f(x) = (x - \sqrt{2})^2$. In particular, the qualification ""almost"" is necessary for the question to be nontrivial.

Indeed, it is positive at all rationals and zero at all irrationals, but the function is continuous at only the irrationals, not everywhere.
