0,Arranging $n$ people around a circular table so that no that no one is to the right of the same person as in the previous seating,Arranging  people around a circular table so that no that no one is to the right of the same person as in the previous seating,n,"A group of $n$ people is seated at a round table.  The group leaves the table for a break and then returns.  In how many ways can the people sit down so that no one is to the right of the same person as in the previous seating? I have been working on this problem for a little bit but it still confuses me. I understand it should be solved through Inclusion-Exclusion, but I struggle with the concept. The concept seems straight forward.  The first person that sits down has $1$ choice, the second person has $(n-2)$ choices, but if the second person sits in the $n$th seat, the third person will have $(n-2)$ choices, but if he doesn't sit in the $n$th seat the third person has $(n-3)$ choices. My idea was to define a set $A_i$ that contains the lists of length $n$ whose elements are chosen from $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ w/o repetition such that for all $1\le i \le n$ the $(i+1)$st element is not in the following spot of the $i$th spot.  Then $i$ would take the total possible combinations $(n-1)!$ and subtract it from the set $A_i$ but I'm not entirely sure how to do that. I also believe it has something to do with derangements and the formula $$n!\sum_{i=0}^n \frac{(-1)^i}{i!}$$ but I am having difficulty connecting the two.","A group of $n$ people is seated at a round table.

4,Linear recurrence analog of fundamental matrix,Linear recurrence analog of fundamental matrix,,"Consider the following first order linear ODE: $$\vec{x}'(t) = A(t)\vec{x}(t)+\vec{f}(t).$$ Let $\Psi(t)$ be a fundamental matrix, i.e. a matrix whose columns are linearly independent solutions to the above equation when $\vec{f} \equiv \vec{0}$. By making the ansazt $\vec{x}(t)=\Psi(t)\vec{c}(t)$ for the solution subject to the initial condition $\vec{x}(t_0)=\vec{x}_0$, it is trivial to show that we get $$\vec{x}(t)=\Xi(t,t_0)\vec{x}_0+\int_{t_0}^{t}\Xi(t,\tau)\vec{f}(\tau)d\tau$$ where we have defined $\Xi(t,\tau)=\Psi(t)\Psi^{-1}(\tau)$. I now want to consider the linear recurrence analog $$\vec{x}(k+1) = A(k)\vec{x}(k)+\vec{f}(k). $$ Again, let $\Psi(k)$ be a fundamental matrix, i.e. a matrix whose columns are linearly independent solutions to the above equation when $\vec{f} \equiv \vec{0}$. It appears natural to make the ansatz $\vec{x}(k) =\Psi(k)\vec{c}(k)$.

My guess is that the final formula will look something like $$\vec{x}(n) = \Xi(n,n_0)\vec{x}_0+\sum_{\eta = n_0}^{n-1}\Xi(n,\eta)\vec{f}(\tau)d\tau$$ if we prescribe the initial condition $\vec{x}(n_0)=\vec{x}_0$.

Question: (a) What is the correct form for the third axiom? Can it be stated precisely? (b) What is the conclusion of the third axiom when applied to $E \in \mathscr{F}$ ? E.g. how should one understand ""the empty set partitions the empty set""? Isn't the empty union equal to $\emptyset$ , not to $E$ ? And if the third axiom makes no sense when applied to $E$ , and $E \in \mathscr{F}$ is only included so that $\mathscr{F}$ isn't empty, then why not say $E \not\in \mathscr{F}, \mathscr{F} \not= \emptyset \subseteq 2^E$ ? Wikipedia says: 3.

Encyclopedia of Mathematics gives two supposedly equivalent forms: 3.(a) If $G_1, \dots, G_k \in \mathscr{F}$ is the family of flats which cover $F \in \mathscr{F}$ (i.e. each $G_i$ contains $F$ properly with no $H \in \mathscr{F}$ in between), then $G_1 \setminus F, \dots, G_k \setminus F$ partition $E \setminus F$ . 3.(b) For all $F \in \mathscr{F}$ , $\bigcup \{ F' \in \mathscr{F}: F' \succ F  \} = E$ . Oxley says: If $F \in \mathscr{F}$ and $\{ G_1, G_2, \dots, G_k\}$ is the set of minimal members of $\mathscr{F}$ that properly contain $F$ , then the sets $G_1 \setminus F, G_2 \setminus F, \dots, G_k \setminus F$ partition $E \setminus F$ . These notes parrot this. Gordon, McNulty say the same thing as the first axiom given by the Encyclopedia of Mathematics, except that they don't even bother to try to explain what ""cover"" means.

(a) $cover: \mathscr{F} \to 2^{2^E}$ , $cover: F \mapsto \{G \in \mathscr{F}: G \supsetneq F, \forall H \in \mathscr{F}, F \subseteq H \subseteq G \implies H = F \lor H = G  \}$ (b) $cover: \mathscr{F} \to 2^{2^E}$ , $cover: F \mapsto \{G \in \mathscr{F}: G \supsetneq F, \forall X \in 2^E, F \subsetneq X \subsetneq G \implies X \not\in \mathscr{F} \}$ EDIT: What I had here before was totally wrong (among other things, it should be $G \setminus F$ , not $E \setminus G$ ). Also the definitions of cover incorrectly said $G \supseteq F$ instead of $G \supsetneq F$ . Then define $[cover(F) \setminus F] \in 2^{2^E}$ by $[cover(F) \setminus F] := \{ G \setminus F: G \in cover(F) \}$ . My understanding of ""partition"" is the following: $[cover(F) \setminus F]$ partitions $E \setminus F$ $\iff$ $\bigsqcup\limits_{G \in cover(F)} G \setminus F = E \setminus F$ , where $\bigsqcup$ denotes disjoint union. EDIT: What follows is also totally incorrect and based on a false premise. We're interested in $G \setminus E$ (which does not exist because $cover(E) = \emptyset$ ), not in $E \setminus E$ , which does exist but is the empty set. I.e. using the right definition $cover(F) \setminus F$ it is an empty union, using the wrong definition $E \setminus cover(F)$ it is a non-empty union of empty sets. When $F = E$ , we should have that $E \setminus F = \emptyset$ , so $$ \bigsqcup\limits_{X \in cover(F)} E \setminus X = \emptyset \,,$$ thus this is supposed to be either an empty union, or a non-empty union of empty set(s). If it is supposed to be an empty union, then we should have that $cover(E) = \emptyset$ . If it is supposed to be a non-empty union of empty set(s), we should have that $cover(E) = \{ E \}$ . In particular, should we have that $cover(E) = \{ E \}$ or $cover(E) = \emptyset$ ?

So $4 \cdot 6 \cdot 4 \cdot 4= 384$ For $(1,3,0)$ is the same, also $384$ However I don't know how to do for $(0,2,2),(2,0,2),(2,2,0)$ because after I draw the first two, how many ways can I order the next two?",,"['combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics', 'combinations']"

I assume the audience here on this site is quite familiar with the proof, so I post only excerpts. Once again, suppose we have a graph $G$ on $k$ vertices. We know that a connected planar simple graph $G$ contains a vertex of degree 5 or less. Suppose the $v$ has $deg(v)=5$ . If we delete this vertex and all edges incident with $v$ , then by our induction hypothesis the resulting graph has a good 5 colouring. Now we reinsert the vertex $v$ . Notice that a good 5-colouring cannot happen if vertex $v$ has neighbours all with different vertex colours since v would then need a 6th colour. We will prove that the neighbours of v cannot all be the same colour now with the following two cases. We will arbitrarily select the red and orange vertices for these cases without loss of generality. Ok that is basically almost the same as proofing the 6 color theorem. Now: CASE 1: If there no is red-orange alternating vertex path starting at the red vertex and ending at the orange vertex, then we can interchange the red vertex with an orange vertex and our proof is complete: Yup, that makes sense to me.

CASE 2: If there is a red-orange alternating vertex path starting at the red vertex and ending at the orange vertex, then inspect the yellow and the green vertices.

All the multisets of size six where each one contains a digit that occurs at least three times can be rewritten in their type form like so: $$(3, 3), (3, 2, 1), (3, 1, 1, 1), (4, 2), (4, 1, 1),  (5, 1), (6)$$ Then, $|(3, 3)| + |(3, 2, 1)| + |(3, 1, 1, 1)| + |(4, 2)| + |(4, 1, 1)| + |(5, 1)| + |(6)| \\ = (6 \cdot 5) + (6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4) + (6 \cdot \binom 53) + (6 \cdot 5) + (6 \cdot \binom 52) + (6 \cdot 5) + 6 \\ = 30 + 120 + 60 + 30 + 60 + 30 + 6 \\ = 336.$ So that's where the second term of  $462 - 336 + 15$ must come from. I am not clear on where $15$ in $462 - 336 + 15$ come from.  So, that's what I'd like to know. Thanks.",,"['combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics', 'inclusion-exclusion']"

61,The nth finite difference of the nth powers of consecutive real numbers yields n!,The nth finite difference of the nth powers of consecutive real numbers yields n!,,"I was recently shown the following observation: if we have the set $$[1^2,2^2,3^2] = [1,4,9]$$ and we form a new set with two elements by subtracting each element from the element to its right, that is to say we form the new set: $$[2^2-1^2, 3^2-2^2] = [3,5]$$  and then we repeat this process, we get $$[5-3] = [2] = [2!]$$ More generally, it was seen that for any real starting number ""a"" followed in the original set by a+1, a+2, this would hold. That is to say: starting with the set: $$[a^2,(a+1)^2,(a+2)^2]$$  and performing the process described one always arrives at the one-element set $$[2!]$$ after 2 repitions of the subtraction process described above. Further generalizing, this holds for any power, not just 2. Stated generally the above observed rule is then starting with the initial set $$[a^n,(a+1)^n,(a+2)^n, (a+3)^n,...,(a+(n-1))^n,(a+n)^n ]$$ and performing the subtraction process described above n times yields the single-element set $$[n!]$$ Immediately evident was that if I used this process n times on a set with n+1 elements, let's say: $$[a_0,a_1,a_2,a_3,...,a_{n-2},a_{n-1},a_n]$$  the following would result: $$\sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom nk a_{n-k}(-1)^k$$ However, this result did not make the n factorial result clear. Going on, I used the easily demonstrated fact that $$(x+1)^n-x^n = \sum_{k=1}^n \binom nkx^{n-k}$$ to find an alternative expression which consisted of a series of nested sums. First I will prove that the above expression is indeed correct. By the binomial theorem, we have that $$(x+1)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom nk  x^{n-k} = \binom n0x^n+\sum_{k=1}^n \binom nk  x^{n-k} = x^n+\sum_{k=1}^n \binom nk  x^{n-k}$$ thus, subtracting $$x^n$$ we get $$(x+1)^n-x^n = \sum_{k=1}^n \binom nkx^{n-k}$$ Since all of the elements in our set differ by 1, this result is particularly useful. Starting again with the set $$[a^n,(a+1)^n,(a+2)^n, (a+3)^n,...,(a+(n-1))^n,(a+n)^n ]$$ we then find that subtracting two consecutive terms, means subtracting $$ (a+c)^n$$ from $$ ((a+c)+1)^n$$ where c is a positive integer that runs from 0 to n-1. From the earlier demonstrated equality, we have that  $$((a+c)+1)^n-(a+c)^n = \sum_{k=1}^n\binom nk(a+c)^{n-k}$$ Thus performing the process once yields the new set: $$[\sum_{k=1}^n\binom nk(a+0)^{n-k},\sum_{k=1}^n\binom nk(a+1)^{n-k},\sum_{k=1}^n\binom nk(a+2)^{n-k},\sum_{k=1}^n\binom nk(a+3)^{n-k},...,\sum_{k=1}^n\binom nk(a+(n-2))^{n-k},\sum_{k=1}^n\binom nk(a+(n-1))^{n-k}]$$ Performing the operation again, we can ignore the outer summation and the binomial coefficients since they are the same for all the terms, and we are then faced with the problem as the original, but with c now running from 0 to (n-2). Thus with the subtraction performed twice, we have produced the set $$[ \sum_{k=1}^n(\binom nk \sum_{j=1}^{n-k}\binom {n-k}j(a)^{n-k-j}), \sum_{k=1}^n(\binom nk \sum_{j=1}^{n-k}\binom {n-k}j(a+1)^{n-k-j}), \sum_{k=1}^n(\binom nk \sum_{j=1}^{n-k}\binom {n-k}j(a+2)^{n-k-j}),..., \sum_{k=1}^n(\binom nk \sum_{j=1}^{n-k}\binom {n-k}j(a+(n-3))^{n-k-j}) \sum_{k=1}^n(\binom nk \sum_{j=1}^{n-k}\binom {n-k}j(a+(n-2))^{n-k-j}) ]$$ Clearly by repeating this process ""b"" times, we increase the number of nested summations to b, while decreasing the number of terms by b. We will have to introduce b ""dummy iterators"" (like k and j) which iterate over the sums. The most internal sum will have the sum of these variables up to the bth one. Clearly c always starts at 0 and ranges from 0 to n-b (Verify this in the above 2 iterations of the process). In mathematical terms, if I introduce a list of dummy variables which I will call $$d_i$$ Then by repeating the subtraction process b times I produce the new set in which each term is of the form  $$\sum_{d_1=1}^n\binom n{d_1} \sum_{d_2=1}^{n-d_1}\binom {n-d_1}{d_2} \sum_{d_3=1}^{n-d_1-d_2}\binom {n-d_1-d_2}{d_3}...\sum_{d_b=1}^{n-{\sum_{i=1}^{b-1}{d_i}}}\binom {n-{\sum_{i=1}^{b-1}{d_i}}}{d_{b}}(a+c)^{n-{\sum_{i=1}^{b}{d_i}}}$$  where c runs from 0 to n-b to give us the elements of the set from left to right. Since the subtraction process decreases the number of terms in the set by 1 each iteration, and we started with n+1 terms in the set, to get our single term resulting series, we should decrease the number of elements by 1 n times, that is to say, perform our subtraction process n times. That means with have now have an expression for our one-element set in terms of the nested summations, by letting $$b=n$$By our ealier formula it is also evident that c now ranges from 0 to n-n, so we can say that $$c=0$$ and eleminate it from the formula entirely. Plugging in n to our earlier formula with b, we get the one element set: $$\sum_{d_1=1}^n\binom n{d_1} \sum_{d_2=1}^{n-d_1}\binom {n-d_1}{d_2} \sum_{d_3=1}^{n-d_1-d_2}\binom {n-d_1-d_2}{d_3}...\sum_{d_n=1}^{n-{\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}{d_i}}}\binom {n-{\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}{d_i}}}{d_n}a^{n-{\sum_{i=1}^n{d_i}}}$$ Notice that when each of these dummy iterators is at their starting value, 1 $$\sum_{i=1}^n{d_i} = n $$ and $$\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}{d_i} = n-1 $$This means that with all d's at a value of 1, the final imbedded summation is $$\binom {n-(n-1)}1a^{n-n}= 1a^0=1$$ What happens if you want to increase one of the d's though? Take for example, $$d_1=2$$Now$$\sum_{i=1}^n{d_i} = n+1 $$ and $$\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}{d_i} = n $$ Therefore the value of the final imbedded term is $$\binom {n-n}1a^{n-n}= \binom 0 1a^{-1}=0$$ Clearly, if we increase any of the d's, we get a binomial coefficient that is ""a number less than 1 choose 1"", which is get 0. Therefore, the only non-zero term in the entire embedded summation exists when all d's are equal to 1, so the summations evaporate leaving only a product of binomial coefficients of the form: $$\binom n{d_1} \binom {n-d_1}{d_2} \binom {n-(d_1+d_2)}{d_3}...\binom {n-{\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}{d_i}}}{d_n}a^{n-{\sum_{i=1}^n{d_i}}}$$ which, by the definition of the binomial coefficients, is equal to: $$\frac {n!}{(n-d_1)!{d_1}!} \frac {(n-d_1)!}{(n-(d_1+d_2))!{d_2}!}\frac {(n-(d_1+d_2))!}{(n-(d_1+d_2+d_3))!{d_3}!}...\frac {(n-\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}{d_i})!}{(n-\sum_{i=1}^{n}{d_i})!{d_n}!}$$Since all d's are now 1, the d!'s on in the denominator are all 1 and can be removed from the expression. Additionally, and quite conveniently, all of the factorials cancel except for $$n!$$ in the numerator and $$(n-\sum_{i=1}^{n}{d_i})!$$ in the the denominator. Recall that since all d's are equal to 1, $$\sum_{i=1}^{n}{d_i} = n$$ so we can simply our final expression to $$ \frac {n!}{(n-n)!} = \frac {n!}{0!} = \frac {n!}1 = n!$$ I would like feedback on whether or not this is a valid demonstration of this fascinating observation...please let me know what you think! Also if there is a name for this phenomenon or this subtraction process I would appreciate knowing that too. I am aware that this is strongly linked to the stirling numbers of the second kind, for which reason I have tagged this post with the tag ""stirling numbers"".","I was recently shown the following observation: if we have the set $$[1^2,2^2,3^2] = [1,4,9]$$ and we form a new set with two elements by subtracting each element from the element to its right, that is to say we form the new set: $$[2^2-1^2, 3^2-2^2] = [3,5]$$  and then we repeat this process, we get $$[5-3] = [2] = [2!]$$ More generally, it was seen that for any real starting number ""a"" followed in the original set by a+1, a+2, this would hold. That is to say: starting with the set: $$[a^2,(a+1)^2,(a+2)^2]$$  and performing the process described one always arrives at the one-element set $$[2!]$$ after 2 repitions of the subtraction process described above. Further generalizing, this holds for any power, not just 2. Stated generally the above observed rule is then starting with the initial set $$[a^n,(a+1)^n,(a+2)^n, (a+3)^n,...,(a+(n-1))^n,(a+n)^n ]$$ and performing the subtraction process described above n times yields the single-element set $$[n!]$$ Immediately evident was that if I used this process n times on a set with n+1 elements, let's say: $$[a_0,a_1,a_2,a_3,...,a_{n-2},a_{n-1},a_n]$$  the following would result: $$\sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom nk a_{n-k}(-1)^k$$ However, this result did not make the n factorial result clear. Going on, I used the easily demonstrated fact that $$(x+1)^n-x^n = \sum_{k=1}^n \binom nkx^{n-k}$$ to find an alternative expression which consisted of a series of nested sums. First I will prove that the above expression is indeed correct. By the binomial theorem, we have that $$(x+1)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom nk  x^{n-k} = \binom n0x^n+\sum_{k=1}^n \binom nk  x^{n-k} = x^n+\sum_{k=1}^n \binom nk  x^{n-k}$$ thus, subtracting $$x^n$$ we get $$(x+1)^n-x^n = \sum_{k=1}^n \binom nkx^{n-k}$$ Since all of the elements in our set differ by 1, this result is particularly useful.

If we break this down, we get the propositional variables q(You can ride the roller coaster), r(You are under four feet tall) and s(You are older than sixteen years old). We can use these to create the propositional statement (r ^ ¬s) ⇒ ¬q Here is the truth table I have formulated. \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline r & s & (r \land ¬s) & ¬q & (r \land ¬s) \rightarrow \neg q   \\  \hline T & T &    T     &  T &       T         \\ T & F &    F     &  F &       T         \\ F & T &    F     &  T &       T         \\ F & F &    F     &  F &       T         \\ \hline \end{array} After looking through this truth table, I noticed that there was a missing condition in the final conditional statement, specifically, if (r ^ ¬s) is T and ¬q is F. Therefore, I created a new truth table as seen below. \begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline  (r \land ¬s) & \neg q & (r \land ¬s) \rightarrow ¬q \\  \hline      T     & T  &       T       \\       F     & T  &       T       \\      T     & F  &       F       \\      F     & F  &       T       \\ \hline \end{array} Thoughts?
