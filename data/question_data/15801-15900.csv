1,Intuitive idea behind the probability density function,Intuitive idea behind the probability density function,,"As an application of Calculus, I am currently teaching some material about continuous random variables. My main example is the height $X$ of a French male chosen randomly in the French population. To explain the probability density function (pdf), I explain that, contrary to discrete variables, knowing $p(X=x)$ is not really interesting (who cares about the probability of being exactly 1.783424567 meter?), but what is of interest is $p(a\leqslant X\leqslant b)$, the probability of being in some interval. So, $p(X=x)$ isn't an interesting one variable function whereas $P(a\leqslant X\leqslant b)=g(a,b)$ is a meaningful function of two variables for probabilities and statistics. But, instead of studying $g$, we prefer to associate to $X$ a pdf, i.e. a function $f$ such that $p(a\leqslant X\leqslant b)=\int_a^b f(x)\ dx$.

Anyways, I realized that I could use this to prove that $$-\int_0^1\ln\left(\ln \frac{1}{x}\right)dx=\gamma$$ Where $\gamma$ is the Euler-mascheroni constant. Here is my proof: Take the derivative of $\int_0^1(-\ln x)^sdx$ with respect to $s$ . To do this, move the differentiation operator inside the integral sign, meaning that we need to take the derivative of $\ln^sx$ . This is the same as $e^{s\ln\ln \frac{1}{x}}$ . By chain rule we get that the derivative of $(-\ln x)^s$ is $\ln(-\ln x)(-\ln x)^s$ . Setting $s=0$ back in the original equation, we get that $\int_0^1\ln\frac{1}{\ln \frac{1}{x}}dx=-\gamma$ since the derivative of the analytic continuation of the factorial function at zero is $-\gamma$ . Multiplying both sides by $-1$ yields the desired expression.

32,Is infinitely small error the same as $0$ error?,Is infinitely small error the same as  error?,0,"I am really confused over the idea. If I have a circle I can approximate its area by using a regular polygon inside of it, with $n$ sides, and I can just split that polygon into triangles and compute the area. If I want better accuracy then I can use a polygon with more sides. The accuracy becomes better since the area between the polygon and circle (the ""error"") decreases as $n$ increases. So it stands to reason that if we could keep adding sides our answer would keep getting better since the error would get closer to $0$. I don't know what it means to ""add infinitely many sides"" because to me the idea doesn't make sense. No matter how many sides there are we can always add one more. But it does make sense to ask what's the value we never actually reach but get closer and closer to? For that we use the concept of a limit. The error becomes ""infinitely small"" but I don't understand what this really means. Is ""infinitely small"" the same as $0$? Because by definition it's never quite getting to $0$.

Computing $f(1)$ is actually an exercise I did in my complex analysis course many years ago now, and I tried using the same approach to solve this, but I ran into an issue that I'll explain below. Here's what I tried... We use a domain $D_R$ which for a given radius $R$ is bounded by $\Gamma_R \cup [-R, R]$ , where $\Gamma_R$ is the upper semicircle with radius $R$ centered at the origin, and $[-R,R]$ is a line segment on the real axis. The function inside the integral, $\frac{\cos z}{1 + z^{2n}}$ , appears to have simple poles at the roots of unity, only rotated by $\pi/4n$ . As a result of this rotation, exactly half of the poles are in the upper half-plane. When we substitute $e^{iz}$ for $\cos z$ here, the residues look like $$\text{Res }\left[\frac{e^{iz}}{1 + z^{2n}},z_j\right] = \lim_{z \rightarrow z_j} (z - z_j)\frac{e^{iz}}{1 + z^{2n}} = \frac{e^{iz_j}}{\prod_{k=1,k \neq j}^{2n}(z_j - z_k)}$$ Note that for points $z \in \Gamma_R$ , $|1 + z^{2n}| \leq R^{2n} - 1$ (since $|z^{2n}| = R^{2n}$ and so $|1 + z^{2n}|$ can be at most one lower than $|z^{2n}|$ ). Since $|e^{iz}| \leq 1$ in the upper half plane, by the ML-estimate, we have $$\left|\int_{\Gamma_R} \frac{e^{iz}}{1 + z^{2n}} dz \right| \leq \frac{\pi R}{R^{2n} - 1}$$ where the right side vanishes as $R \rightarrow \infty$ . In other words, $$\lim_{R \rightarrow \infty}\int_{\Gamma_R} \frac{e^{iz}}{1 + z^{2n}} dz = 0.$$ By the Residue Theorem, we have $$\begin{align*} \int_{\partial D_R} \frac{e^{iz}}{1 + z^{2n}} dz & = \int_{\Gamma_R} \frac{e^{iz}}{1 + z^{2n}} dz + \int_{-R}^R \frac{e^{iz}}{1 + z^{2n}} dz \\ & = 2 \pi i \sum_{j = 1}^n\left(\text{Res }\left[\frac{e^{iz}}{1 + z^{2n}},z_j\right] \right) \\ & = 2 \pi i \sum_{j = 1}^n\left(\frac{e^{iz_j}}{\prod_{k=1,k \neq j}^{2n}(z_j - z_k)} \right) \\ \end{align*}$$ where I'm assuming $j \in \{1, 2, \dots, n\}$ represent the half of the poles which are in the upper half plane. When we take $R \rightarrow \infty$ this gives $$\begin{align*} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{e^{iz}}{1 + z^{2n}} dz & = 2 \pi i \sum_{j = 1}^n\left(\frac{e^{iz_j}}{\prod_{k=1,k \neq j}^{2n}(z_j - z_k)} \right) - \lim_{R \rightarrow \infty}\int_{\Gamma_R} \frac{e^{iz}}{1 + z^{2n}} dz \\ & = 2 \pi i \sum_{j = 1}^n\left(\frac{e^{iz_j}}{\prod_{k=1,k \neq j}^{2n}(z_j - z_k)} \right).\end{align*}$$ This is normally where I would take the real part of the right side to get the value of $f(n)$ , but I really don't even know how to compute that.

Hint: To treat $\sqrt3$, for example, use the fact that every integer is of the form $3n$, $3n+1$ or $3n+2$. Solution from the ""Answers"" Chapter: Since $$ \\ (3n+1)^2 = 9n^2 +6n + 1 = 3(3n^2+2n)+1 \\ (3n+2)^2 = 9n^2 +12n + 4 = 3(3n^2+4n +1)+1 $$ He proceeds then to state that if $k^2$ is divisible by 3, then so is $k$. I have a hard time understanding what $k$ he is talking about in these equations, it hasn't been defined earlier. He then proceeds: Supose $\sqrt3$ were rational, and let $\sqrt3 = p/q$, where $p$ and $q$ have no common factor. Then $p^2=3q^2$, so $p^2$ is divisible by 3, so $p$ must be. Thus, $p=3p'$ for some natural number $p'$ and consequently $(3p')^2=3q^2$, or $3(p')^2=q^2$. Thus, $q$ is also divisible by 3, a contradiction. I have a hard time linking the first part where he states that "" $k^2$ being divisible by 3 leads to $k$ being divisible by 3 "" and the second part. Where does the first conclusion come from?
