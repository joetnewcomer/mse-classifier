The restricted mapping $Tr' \ : \ \mathbb{F}_{p^n} \ \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_p $ is surjective. I failed to prove both these statements, and I ask you for some help. Research effort for the first statement We can see $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$ as a vector space with the scalar field $\mathbb{F}_p$. I showed that $Tr$ is a linear mapping in this setting. I convinced myself that the mapping is not an ismorfism in general by looking at the case where $p=n=2$ and $x\neq 0 \neq y$. Assume that $Tr$ is multiplicative. then $$Tr(xy) \ = \ Tr(x)Tr(y) \quad \iff \quad xy + x^2y^2 \ = \ (x+x^2)(y+y^2) \ = \ x^2y^2 +xy^2+x^2y +xy$$  and by substracting we see $$x^2y+x^2y=0 \quad \iff \quad xy(x+y) = 0 \quad \iff \quad x = -y$$ And this is not generally true in a field with four elements... I had no inspiration to continue some other way. Research effort for the second statement I knew that for all elements $x \in \mathbb{F}_p, \ Tr(x) = \sum_{j=1}^n x^{p^j}=\sum_{j=1}^n x$.

Thank you for your time.","Let $p$ be a prime number, and consider the mapping called the trace $$ Tr \quad : \quad \mathbb{F}_{p^n} \ \longrightarrow \ \mathbb{F}_{p^n} \quad : \quad x \ \longmapsto \ x + x^p + x^{p^2} + \cdots + x^{p^{n-1}}$$ My syllabus Abstract Algebra states the following: Every element $x \in \mathbb{F}_{p^n}$, is mapped to $\mathbb{F}_p$. The restricted mapping $Tr' \ : \ \mathbb{F}_{p^n} \ \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_p $ is surjective. I failed to prove both these statements, and I ask you for some help. Research effort for the first statement We can see $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$ as a vector space with the scalar field $\mathbb{F}_p$. I showed that $Tr$ is a linear mapping in this setting. I convinced myself that the mapping is not an ismorfism in general by looking at the case where $p=n=2$ and $x\neq 0 \neq y$. Assume that $Tr$ is multiplicative. then $$Tr(xy) \ = \ Tr(x)Tr(y) \quad \iff \quad xy + x^2y^2 \ = \ (x+x^2)(y+y^2) \ = \ x^2y^2 +xy^2+x^2y +xy$$  and by substracting we see $$x^2y+x^2y=0 \quad \iff \quad xy(x+y) = 0 \quad \iff \quad x = -y$$ And this is not generally true in a field with four elements... I had no inspiration to continue some other way. Research effort for the second statement I knew that for all elements $x \in \mathbb{F}_p, \ Tr(x) = \sum_{j=1}^n x^{p^j}=\sum_{j=1}^n x$. If this the mapping would be injective here, we would be done since the sum $x+ \cdots +x$ is an element of $\mathbb{F}_p$.

Does this definition make sense, is it useful, and if so where can I read about these structures? It is true that any such ~homomorphism induces a homomorphism (in the usual sense) from $M$ to a new module with ring action defined by $\phi$ and that of $N$. However, this new module depends on $\phi$; you can't do this for all ~homomorphisms at once. You'll see from my motivation that this is of no use to me. I would also like to know the merits of such a definition applied to modules over different rings (replace the lower copy of $R$ in the diagram above with another ring $S$). Some interesting things seem to happen, for example the inclusion of a real vector space into its complexification is a ~homomorphism; more generally a complex vector space can have real subspaces in the genuine morphism sense. Complex conjugate-linear maps are also ~homomorphisms. One has to be careful though, because a bijective ~homomorphism is not necessarily an ~isomorphism. This happens in other categories too, e.g. a smooth bijection need not be a diffeomorphism etc., so I see no problem immediately.

59,Why does field theory still work with generalized field extensions (embeddings)?,Why does field theory still work with generalized field extensions (embeddings)?,,"When $E/F$ is a field extension, I've always assumed that $E \supseteq F$ . However, there is a more general definition that $E/F$ is a field extension iff $E, F$ are fields and there is an embedding $i : F \to E$ . For example, with $\omega := e^{2 \pi i/3}$ , $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2}) \cong \mathbb{Q}(\omega \sqrt[3]{2})$ since we are adjoining roots of the same minimal polynomial $X^3 - 2$ , so $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{\sqrt[3]{2}}) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ can be viewed as an extension not only of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})$ , but also of $\mathbb{Q}(\omega \sqrt[3]{2})$ . Suppose that $E_1, E_2$ are fields with embeddings $i_1 : F \to E_1$ , $i_2 : F \to E_2$ , so that $E_1/F$ , $E_2/F$ are extensions. Define an $F$ -homomorphism as a ring homomorphism $\phi : E_1 \to E_2$ such that $\phi \circ i_1 = i_2$ . This definition agrees with the usual notion of field extensions as supersets, where an $F$ -homomorphism restricts to the identity on $F$ . This new definition troubles me because I don't know if theorems I've proved using the old definition will still hold true for this generalized definition. If a proof assumes field extensions are supersets, how can I translate it to a proof where the extensions are embeddings? For instance, Brian Conrad proves here that if $E/F$ is algebraic, then there is an $F$ -homomorphism $\phi : E \to \overline{F}$ embedding $E$ in the algebraic closure $\overline{F}$ . Throughout this proof, I assumed $\overline{F} \supseteq F$ . Is there a change in perspective that makes the proof hold with $F$ merely embedding in $\overline{F}$ ? As a corollary, if $E'/E$ is an algebraic extension (in the superset sense), then there is an $F$ -homomorphism $E' \to \overline{F}$ extending $\phi$ . Proof: $E$ embeds in $\overline{F}$ , so $\overline{F}$ is an extension (under the general definition) of $E$ that is an algebraic closure $\overline{E}$ , so there is an $E$ -homomorphism $\psi : E' \to \overline{E}$ , which by definition says $\psi|_E = \psi \circ \mathrm{Id}_E = \phi$ since $\phi$ is the embedding of $E$ in $\overline{E}$ .

So I tried to solve these problems by considering (in $\mathbb{C}$ ) the intersection of $yz = x^2 + \alpha z^2$ $yz = x^3 + \beta z^3$ Here we've projectivized, and the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ were added to try and solve the genericness issue while keeping the equation somewhat simple. So surely these equations will have 6 solutions, right? Well... If we look in the $x=1$ plane, then we see $1 + \alpha z^2 = yz = 1 + \beta z^2$ , so either $z=0$ or $z = \frac{\alpha}{\beta}$ . I think the solution $z=0$ doesn't actually exist, though, since $y0 = 1 + \alpha 0^2$ has no solutions for $y$ . So we pick up 1 solution.

(took me like 5 hours and it seems trivial - just build a bijection). I am not sure that I haven't made any errors though. Perhaps some other proof would be simpler. Statement: $G$ is a group and $H,K,HK \subseteq G$ Prove that $|HK|=\frac{|H||K|}{|H \cap K|}$ Proof: The statement above is equivalent to: $\frac{|HK|}{|K|}=\frac{|H|}{|H \cap K|}$ So now we look at the cosets of $K$ in $HK$ - ie. the elements of $HK/K$ . They are exactly $\frac{|HK|}{|K|}$ because of Lagrange's theorem. Then we look at the cosets of $H \cap K$ in $H$ - ie. the elements of $H/H \cap K$ . They are exactly $\frac{|H|}{|H \cap K|}$ because of Lagrange's theorem. So if we could find a bijection from $HK/K$ to $H/H \cap K$ , we are done. So let's look at the elements of $HK/K$ , they are cosets of the form: $h_1k_1K$ , but $k_1K=K$ , so we get $h_1K$ . Then lets look at the elements of $H/H \cap K$ , they are cosets of the form: $h_1H \cap K$ . So let's define $f: HK/K \to H/H \cap K$ , $f(hK)=hH \cap K$ . To see that it's a function we need to show that it's well defined. Let $h_1K=h_2K$ , ie. $h_2^{-1}h_1 \in K$ which also implies $h_2^{-1}h_1 \in H \cap K$ Then we need to show that $f(h_1K)=f(h_2K)$ . So $f(h_1K)=h_1H \cap K$ and $f(h_2K)=h_2H \cap K$ To prove that $h_1H \cap K = h_2H \cap K$ we need $h_2^{-1}h_1 \in H \cap K$ . But we've already shown that. Hence f is well defined. Now we need to show that it's injective. Suppose $f(h_1K)=f(h_2K)$ , but $h1K \neq h2K$ . Ie. $h_1H \cap K = h_2H \cap K$ but $h_1K \neq h_2K$ . $h_1K \neq h_2K$ implies $h_2^{-1}h_1 \notin K$ which implies $h_2^{-1}h_1 \notin H \cap K$ . Hence $h_1H \cap K \neq h_2H \cap K$ . So we know f is injective. Now to check for surjectivity: Since $H/H \cap K$ has elements of the form $h_1H \cap K$ , for each of them we have, $f(h_1K)=h_1H \cap K$ .

Using an example set of $S = \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$ It seems to me like a good first intuition is the following: Reflexive An equivalence relation's reflexive property basically ensures that every element in the set under examination can be partitioned (i.e. occupy its own equivalence class). For example, if we had $R_1$ be a relation on $S$ defined as $x-y$ is divisible by $10$ , then, because $(1,1)$ , $(2,2)$ , $(3,3)$ , $etc$ are order pairs that will all satisfy $R_1$ , we will end up with 10 different equivalence classes ( $e.g. [1],[2],[3], etc)$ . Therefore, all elements are partitioned...which makes sense because each of these elements $mod(10)$ have a unique remainder...namely $1$ , $2$ , $3$ , $etc$ Transitive An equivalence relation's transitive property basically allows you to ""unidirectionally"" (my meaning will be understood shortly) link all elements belonging to the same equivalence class. For example, if we had $R_2$ be a relation on $S$ defined as $x-y$ is divisible by $2$ , then the following ordered pairs (non-exhaustive) are certainly in the set: $(2,4)$ , $(4,6)$ , $(6,8)$ . Pretend I do not know any other ordered pairs. Now, if I choose as my representative element $[2]$ , I can build my equivalence class by starting with $2\ R_2\ n$ . Well, $(2,4)$ is in $R_2$ therefore, $4$ belongs to the same equivalence class as $2$ . What works with $4\ R_2\ n$ ? Well $(4,6)$ is in $R_2$ and therefore $6$ is in the same equivalence class as $2$ and $4$ . However, let's say that I start with $[8]$ instead of $[2]$ . Which of the elements in set $S$ are in the same equivalence class? Namely, for which value of $n$ is $8\ R_2\ n$ true? Well, I know I have the ordered pair $(6,8)$ ...but that is not the same form as $8\ R_2\ 6$ . If only I knew that $(8,6)$ was also in the set describing $R_2$ ...and this is where symmetry comes into play. Symmetric An equivalence relation's symmetry property, in conjunction with the transitive property , allows you to bidirectionally link all elements belonging to an equivalence class (regardless of which 'starting element' you choose to represent your equivalence class).

We can form the subring $\mathbb{k}[t]\subset \operatorname{Frac}(A)$ , the smallest ring containing $t$ . We have identities like $t^2=x$ and $t^3 = y$ . Now - why is $\mathbb{k}[t]$ isomorphic to $\mathbb{k}[X]$ - the ring of polynomials in one variable? In other words, how we know that for any non-zero polynomial $p\in \mathbb{k}[X]$ , $p(t)\neq 0$ , i.e. $t$ is transcendental? Motivation: The question is motivated by another question, about the normalization of A , in which was determined that the normalization of $\widetilde{A}$ is indeed equal to $\mathbb{k}[t]$ . In there, the author of the question explicitly states in the comments that $t$ is not algebraic over $\mathbb{k}$ , but with no proof. So the proof should trivial, but still I don't see it. I think I have a proof of this fact, but it is unnecessarily complicated. I'm looking for a one-sentence proof. Nevertheless, I would be really thankful for a proof verification. Let $w\in \mathbb{k}[T]$ be a polynomial such that $w(t) = 0$ in $\mathbb{k}[t]$ . It is of the form $$ w(T) = a_n T^n + \cdots+ a_1 T + a_0 $$ Using the definition of $t$ , I make a polynomial $w' \in \mathbb{k}[X,Y]$ $$ w'(X,Y) = a_n Y^n + a_{n-1} Y^{n-1} X + \cdots +a_1 Y X^{n-1} + a_0 X^n $$ so that $w'(x,y) = x^n w(t) $ in $A$ . Therefore $w'(x,y) = 0$ . It means that $w' \in \ker p$ , where $p$ is a natural projection $p: \mathbb{k}[X,Y] \to \mathbb{k}[x,y]/(x^3-y^2)$ , so we have $w'(X,Y) = (X^3-Y^2)v(X,Y)$ for $v \in \mathbb{k}[X,Y]$ . So we have a factorization $$ a_n Y^n + a_{n-1} Y^{n-1} X + \cdots + a_1 Y X^{n-1} + a_0 X^n = (X^3 - Y^2)v(X,Y)$$ Assuming $a_n \neq 0$ we see that $-a_0 Y^{n-2}$ should be among addends of $v$ (by comparing coefficients). Then we would have $-a_0 Y^{n-2} X^3$ in the product $(X^3-Y^2)v(X,Y)$ . But the coefficient in $w'$ before the $Y^{n-2} X^3$ term is $0$ , so to cancel it, we need either $$-a_0 Y^{n-4} X^3$$ or $$a_0 Y^{n-2}$$ term in $v(X,Y)$ .  But it cannot be the latter - we already determined the coefficient before $Y^{n-2}$ to be $-a_0$ . So it must be $-a_0 Y^{n-4} X^3$ . But then, analogously, we get $-a_0 Y^{n-4} X^6$ that need to be canceled in the product.  Continuing like this, after $\lceil{\frac{n}{2}}\rceil$ steps we no longer could form the term for canceling, because the exponent would need to be negative.

I thought an example of all 2x2 matrices with entries from any fields (like R, the real number), and it is clearly that not all of them are invertible, thus do not have multiplicative inverses, but how do I show the ideals are only (0) and the whole ring?

98,If the norm of an ideal is prime then the ideal is prime,If the norm of an ideal is prime then the ideal is prime,,"Let $K$ be a number field and $D = \mathcal{O}_K$ its ring of integers. Let $I$ be a non-zero integral ideal of $D$ and suppose that the norm $N(I)$ is a (rational) prime. I want to prove that $I$ is a prime ideal in $D$. Since $D$ is a Dedekind domain, $I$ has a unique factorisation into prime ideals, so write $I = \mathfrak{p}_1\cdots\mathfrak{p}_n$. Then, since the norm is completely multiplicative, we have $$N(I) = N(\mathfrak{p}_1)\cdots N(\mathfrak{p}_n) = p$$ from some prime $p \in \Bbb Z$. In particular, this means that $p \mid N(\mathfrak{p}_i)$ for some $i \in \lbrace 1, \dots, n\rbrace$, and the product of the remaining norms is equal to $1$. Does this mean that $N(I) = N(\mathfrak{p}_i)$ for some $i$ and hence that $I = \mathfrak{p}_i$?","Let $K$ be a number field and $D = \mathcal{O}_K$ its ring of integers.

In an answer to the linked question, Zev Chonoles quotes the first page of Chapter 11 of Washington's Introduction to Cyclotomic Fields which states that the only $\mathbb Z[\zeta_n]$ with $\zeta_n$ a root of unity that are PID s (with class number 1) are extensions with the following values of $n$: 1,  3,  4,  5,  7,  8,    9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 27, 28, 32, 33, 35, 36, 40, 44, 45, 48, 60, 84. In addition, values of $n \equiv 2 \mod 4$ are also allowed, because for example, $\mathbb Z[\zeta_{30}] = \mathbb Z[\zeta_{15}]$.  So my question is, which are known to be Euclidean Domains?  I'm especially interested if $n = 60$ admits a form of the Euclidean division algorithm.","After having accidentally duplicated this question , I thought I'd follow up with a related question.
