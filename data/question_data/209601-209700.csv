After poking around in a few different websites I think I'm starting to grasp the idea. I'm just looking to clarify something I read to see if I'm understanding something correctly. On one of the of the websites I was looking at it, it gave the following example: $x_1=3, x_n=3x_{n-1}$ $x_2=3x_1=9$ $x_3=3x_2=27$ $x_4=3x_3=81$ Having ""solved"" the equation for multiple instances, it is noticed that the answers are powers of 3. Thereby making the formula $x_n=3^n$ . I have a few questions. Is it valid to re-write the starting formula as $x_{n+1}=3x_n$ or does this fundamentally change something with the base formula? Is it necessary to solve for several iterations of the base equation to derive the formula or is there a method to have inferred the $x_n=3^n$ from the original formula? Are the solvable iterations necessary for proof? I will probably have more questions. As this area of mathematics is new to me, and has been self-study.

Let $\displaystyle\mathbf 1:=\sum_{i=1}^ne_i$ . Further let $w\in \mathbb R^n$ be arbitrary. For $g=\{w+t\mathbf 1 : t\in \mathbb R\}$ I would like to show that $u\in g$ and $v\in \mathbb Z^n$ exist with $\|u-v\|<\frac{1}{2\sqrt 3}\sqrt{n}$ . I realize that it doesn't hold for ""small"" $n\in \mathbb N$ , but I think it should hold for large ones. Let me write what I have been thinking about: Since $g$ intersects the hyperplane $H=\{x\in \mathbb R^n : x_n=0\}$ w.l.o.g. we can assume that $w\in H$ . Now, if we choose the point $v\in \mathbb Z^n$ that has the smallest distance in each component of $w$ , we know $|v_i-w_i|\leq \frac 12$ for $1\leq i<n$ and $v_n=w_n=0$ . On the other hand, we know that the distance from $g$ to this $v$ is \begin{align*} d(g,v)=\| (v-w) - \frac 1n\langle v-w, \mathbf 1\rangle\mathbf 1 \|. \end{align*} If we set $p:=v-w$ we get \begin{align*} d(g,v)^2 &=\| p - \frac 1n\langle p, \mathbf 1\rangle\mathbf 1 \|^2\\\ &=\| p\|^2-2\frac 1n\langle p, \mathbf 1\rangle\cdot\langle p, \mathbf 1\rangle + \frac{1}{n^2}\langle p, \mathbf 1\rangle^2\cdot \| \mathbf 1\|^2\\ &=\| p\|^2-\frac 2n\langle p, \mathbf 1\rangle^2 + \frac{1}{n}\langle p, \mathbf 1\rangle^2\\ &=\| p\|^2-\frac 1n\langle p, \mathbf 1\rangle^2. \end{align*} Now the problem is, if I have, for example, $p=(\underbrace{\frac 12, \ldots, \frac 12}_{\frac{n-1}{2}\ \text{times}}, \underbrace{-\frac 12, \ldots, -\frac 12}_{\frac{n-1}{2}\ \text{times}}, 0)$ , then $d(g,v)=\frac{\sqrt{n-1}}{2}$ . But in this case there is a point $v'\in\mathbb Z^n$ such that $p'=(\underbrace{\frac 12, \ldots, \frac 12}_{n-1\ \text{times}}, 0)$ and then $d(g,v')=\sqrt{\frac 12-\frac{1}{4n}}\approx \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}$ .

41,Planar graph with $|V|\ge3$ has the average degree of vertices smaller than $6$,Planar graph with  has the average degree of vertices smaller than,|V|\ge3 6,"$G$ is a planar graph with $|V|\geq 3$ . How to show that $G$ has an average degree of vertices smaller than 6? Would it be enough to note that if $G$ has less then 6 nodes the average cannot be over 5 and the existence of connected components further decreases the $\frac{\sum_{v\in V}deg(v)}{|V|}$ , so w.l.g. it can be proved for a connected graph (component) and extended to all connected components if needed? Proof: If $G$ has no cycles it is a tree. $|E|=|V|-1$ and that is smaller than $|V|\leq |V|+2|V|-6 = |3|V-6$ so $$|E|\leq |3|V-6$$ If $G$ has cycles: we note that each face is bounded by 3 edges and the sum of the degrees of the faces has to be at least three times number of all faces: $$\sum_{f\in F}deg(f)\geq3|F|$$ Furthermore, each edge bounds at most two faces so $$\sum_{f\in F}deg(f)\leq2|E|$$ We would have $3|F|\leq2|E|$ . Using Euler's formula we get $$3|F|=3|E|-3|V|-6$$ after multiplying it by scalar and combining both we get: $2|E|\geq 3|E|-3|V|-6$ and $$|E|\leq 3|V|-6$$ Let's suppose that the degree of each node in $G$ is at least 6 (contraposition). $$\frac{\sum_{v\in V}deg(v)}{|V|} \geq 6 \\  2|E|\geq 6|V| \\ |E|\geq 3|V|$$ But we have just shown that $|E|\leq 3|V|-6$ , so $2|E|\leq 6|V|-12$ . This two cannot be true at the same time for graph/connected component with $|V|\geq 6$ .

For $x\in S$ , let $W(x)$ be the Hamming weight of $x$ i.e. number of ones in $x$ . I am trying to find a bijection $f:S\to S$ which maps bitstrings in the following periodic manner. Bitstrings of low weight are mapped to bitstrings of medium weight. Then bitstrings of medium weight are mapped to bitstrings of high weight and finally the high weight ones are mapped back to low weight ones. My attempt: Consider $x\in S$ . If we take the $XOR$ of the $n-$ bits of $x$ , append the result to $x$ and pop the first bit of $x$ to get a bitstring say $y$ . Then let $f(x)=y$ defines a bijection. But this bijection doesn't satisfy the above requirements because $W(f(x))=W(x)+1$ if $W(x)$ is odd and the first bit of $x$ is $0$ and $W(f(x))=W(x)-1$ if $W(x)$ is even and the first bit of $x$ is $1$ . So with this $f$ , we move up/down a weight class depending on whether the current weight is odd/even and it's clearly not periodic. So instead of moving up/down, I would like a bijection that only goes up weight classes initially, then we reach medium weight at which point we need to go down weight classes as described above.

This is a part of a larger problem I'm working on: Random walk on the set of bitstrings and this $f$ helps me shuffle the bitstrings so that the random walk converges to its stationary distribution faster.

Prove this by induction on the number of vertices. Solution I reached a solution to this problem; however, I wasn't able to reach a conclusion using induction. First, I'm going to show the solution without using induction. Then, I will show the beginning of a solution that attempts to use induction, but in which I got stuck. Without using induction In this solution, I'm going to use, without proof, the following theorem about finite forests, found on the textbook I'm using: Theorem . A finite forest $F$ cosists of exactly $|V(F)| - |E(F)|$ trees. Let $G$ be any finite simple graph with $n$ vertices and exactly $|V(G)| - |E(G)|$ components. Then, there is a set $E \subseteq E(G)$ of edges on cycles of $G$ such that removing these edges from $G$ leaves an acyclic graph $H = G - E$ . By definition, $H$ is a forest. Then, by the above Theorem, it has $|V(H)| - |E(H)|$ connected components. Removing edges on cycles from $G$ doesn't change the number of connected components, because, for each edge $e$ that was removed from $G$ , there is a path between the endpoints of $e$ that doesn't include $e$ . So, $G$ and $H$ have the same number of connected components: $$|V(G)| - |E(G)| = |V(H)| - |E(H)|$$ Since $V(H) = V(G)$ and $E(H) = E(G) - |E|$ , substituting these values in the above expression yields: $$|V(G)| - |E(G)| = |V(G)| - (|E(G)| - |E|)$$ $$|V(G)| - |E(G)| = |V(G)| - |E(G)| + |E|$$ $$|E| = 0$$ So, $G$ had no cycles to begin with. Therefore, $G$ is a forest. Using induction Induction hypothesis : $P(n)$ := if a finite simple graph $G$ with $n$ vertices has exactly $|V(G)| - |E(G)|$ components, then $G$ is a forest. Base case ( $n = 1$ ): A graph with only 1 vertex has $|V(G)| - |E(G)| = 1$ component, and it's a forest. So, $P(1)$ is true.

The modification of the standard SEIR model lies in the handling of the duration of infectiousness . Usually this is handled (just like the latency period above) as a recovering or removal rate . In our model individuals become recovered not by rate but exactly days after getting infected. This means for we substract instead of .

In particular,   if $s \equiv x^2 \equiv (x')^2 \pmod p$ where $x \neq x'$ , and   likewise $x \equiv y^2 \equiv (y')^2 \pmod q$ , then $s$ has exactly   four square roots modulo $pq$ , namely, $$s \equiv (xy)^2 \equiv (x'y)^2 \equiv (xy')^2 \equiv (x'y')^2 \pmod{pq}$$ As an attempt to understand the quote, suppose I want to find the square roots of $11$ modulo $133$ . So, I have $s = 11$ , and, since $133 = 7 \times 19$ , I have $p = 7$ and $q = 19$ . I first need to separately find the roots of $11$ modulo $7$ and of $11$ modulo $19$ : To find the roots modulo $7$ , solve $x^2 \equiv 11 \pmod 7$ .

Since $11 \equiv 7^2 \equiv 12^2 \pmod{19}$ , the roots are $y = 7$ and $y' = 12$ . The quote is saying that $xy$ , $x'y$ , $xy'$ and $x'y'$ are roots of $s$ modulo $pq$ .
