How to make this computation in a good way?","I'm trying to get practice using Rodrigues' formula for Legendre Polynomials, but it's being quite confusing to manipulate that $n$-th derivative. Basically, I'm trying to calculate: $$\int_{-1}^1 x^n P_n(x) dx$$ using Rodrigues' formula. Substituing $P_n$ we have $$\int_{-1}^1 x^n P_n(x)dx = \dfrac{1}{2^n n!} \int_{-1}^1 x^n \dfrac{d^n}{dx^n}(x^2-1)^ndx$$ Now integrating by parts I have the following: $$\int_{-1}^1 x^nP_n(x)dx=\dfrac{1}{2^n n!}\left(x^n \dfrac{d^{n-1}}{dx^{n-1}}(x^2-1)^n \bigg|_{-1}^1 - n\int_{-1}^1 x^{n-1} \dfrac{d^{n-1}}{dx^{n-1}}(x^2-1)^ndx\right)$$ Now I don't know how to evaluate that boundary term, also I would need to do integration by parts again, but then what? I imagine I would keep doing it until the derivative disappears. In the process I would get a lot of boundary terms and then in the end $$\int_{-1}^1x^nP_n(x)dx = \dfrac{1}{2^n n!}\left([\text{Boundary terms}] + (-1)^n n!\int_{-1}^1(x^2 -1)^n dx\right)$$ Where the $(-1)^n$ comes because at each step the new integral is multiplied by the sign of the last one and the $n!$ appears because the $n$ on the first integral multiplies $(n-1)$ on the second and so forth. But still, this is something I see intuitively, how can I really calculate that? Also, how to deal with all those boundary terms?

Background: I was trying to calculate the average ""correlation"" value of a two-dimensional area $[0,H]\times[0,W]$ . In my task, the ""correlation"" $\rho$ is modeled as: $$ \rho(d)=e^{-\alpha d}, $$ where $d\in \mathbb{R}^+$ is the distance of two points. For a given point $(z,t)$ satisfying $0\le z\le H$ and $0\le t \le W$ , its average ""correlation"" is: $$ f(z,t)=\frac{1}{HW}\int_0^H{\int_0^W{\rho \left( \sqrt{\left( x-z \right) ^2+\left( y-t \right) ^2} \right)}dxdy}. $$ And for the whole area, the average ""correlation"" is: $$ I=\frac{1}{HW}\int_0^H{\int_0^W{f\left( z,t \right)}dzdt}. $$ Finally I get the formula in the original problem, resulting in a quadruple integral. Some Other Aspects of Help That You May Provide: I think that the original problem is too difficult. There may be some other operations helpful for me: I can change the modeling of $\rho$ . I model it from my observed data (see the figure below). Since when $d=0$ , there is $\rho=1$ (the value of each point is strongly correlated to itself), and $\rho$ is approximately decreasing but always positive in $[0,+\infty)$ . I guess the formula could be $\rho(d)=e^{-\alpha d}$ . Is there a better modeling? (The horizontal axis corresponds to $d$ , and the vertical axis corresponds to $\rho$ . The values of $\rho$ are more reliable when $0\le d\le 300$ , since the data sample number of $0\le d\le 300$ are sufficiently large and number of $d>300$ are relatively small.) I can change the calculation way of ""average"". Since the integration may be too difficult to calculate, I can use another way to measure the ""average"" of the area. Is there a better way? I try not to modify the original integral form, since it is easy to interpret and understand. Instead of directly calculating $I(H,W)$ , I can also change to calculate $I(H_1,W_1)-I(H_2,W_2)$ , since I care the difference of ""average correlations"" of two areas. However, the difference seems to be more difficult to calculate. Since $\rho$ is decreasing in $[0,+\infty)$ , I intuitively think that a small area will own a larger ""average correlation"", i.e. , $I(H_1,W_1)<I(H_2,W_2)$ when $H_1\times W_1 > H_2\times W_2$ .
