8,An infinite set has always a countably infinite subset?,An infinite set has always a countably infinite subset?,,"Upon studying cardinality, the statement ""an infinite set has always a countably infinite subset"" seems intuitive to me.

Now there are two types of infinite sets so we will divide our proof in two cases: $I$ is countably infinite : That is, to say, it has the same cardinality as $\mathbb{N}$ . $$ \vert I \vert = \vert \mathbb{N} \vert $$ Then it must be that $\vert I \vert \leq \vert \mathbb{N} \vert$ and $\vert \mathbb{N} \vert \leq \vert I \vert$ i.e. there is a bijection, say $f$ , such that $f: \mathbb{N} \mapsto I$ . This implies $I \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{N} \subseteq I$ . Therefore, $\mathbb{N}$ is a subset of $I$ . $I$ is not countably infinite : Now, since $I \neq \emptyset$ ; we choose and take out some element $i_1$ from $I$ . As $I \setminus \{i_1\}$ is also not empty( $\vert I \vert = 1$ otherwise), we choose and take out some $i_2$ from $I \setminus \{i_1\}$ . Similarly, continuing we end up with a countably infinite set: $$ I_c = \{i_1, i_2, i_3, \dots\}$$ from $I$ such that $\vert I_c \vert = \vert \mathbb{N} \vert$ . Then it must be that $\vert I_c \vert \leq \vert \mathbb{N} \vert $ and $\vert \mathbb{N} \vert \leq \vert I_c \vert $ . Therefore, a countably infinite set is a subset of $I_c$ .
