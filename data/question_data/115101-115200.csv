I have 4 unknowns: A, B, C and D. $\therefore (Ax + B)(x - 3) + (Cx + D)(x + 5) = x^2 - 4$ After expanding and regrouping the coefficients: $(A + C) x^2 + (-3A + B + 5C + D)x + (-3B + 5D) = x^2 - 4$ Here the coefficient of the term $x^2$ is 1 therefore: $(A+C) = 1$ similarly: $(-3A + B + 5C + D) = 0$ $(-3B + 5D) = -4$ I still have to get one more equation to be able to solve this system so I substituted 1 for x and I got this equation: $-2A - 2B + 6C + 6D = -3$ After getting four equations I used this site to solve the system of equations. Unfortinetly I got no soultion. Tried another site and also the same result.

After tring to figure out why this is happening, I've managed to prove logically that this equation: $(Ax + B)(x - 3) + (Cx + D)(x + 5) = x^2 - 4$ has an infinite solutions and my approach was as follows: After doing polynomial long division and decomposing the fraction using the traditional way, the result should be: $\frac{5}{8(x - 3)} - \frac{21}{8(x - 5)} + 1$ Now I can add the last term (the one) to the first term and get the follows: $\frac{8x-19}{8(x-3)} - \frac{21}{8(x+5)}$ From that solution I can see that $A = 0, B = \frac{-21}{8}, C = 1, D = \frac{-19}{8}$ . After all these are just the coefficients of the terms. and this solution worked fine. Alternatively I can add the one to the second term instead and get: $\frac{5}{8(x-3)} + \frac{8x + 19}{8(x+5)}$ Now $A = 1, B = \frac{19}{8}, C = 0, D = \frac{5}{8}$ Generally, after adding the one to any of the terms, I can add any number to one of the terms and add its negative to the other term and the equation will remain the same, But the value of the 4 constants (A, B, C, and D) will change.

I request feedback on how someone could come up with any of these solutions given that the direct approach above did not work. Inspiration, Approach, Solution Intuitively, we suspect that the pairs are equal, since if $c = ar$ , then $b = a/r$ , implying that the $\Delta a$ by multiplying $a$ by $r$ is negative the $\Delta b$ by dividing by $r$ , which suggests $r = 1$ .

So we need to form a polynomial with roots $a,b$ .   And remembering ""Math has a tendency to reward you if you respect its symmetries"" , we form a second polynomial $g$ , aiming to show equality: $$f(x) = (x-a)(x-b)\\ g(x) = (x-c)(x-d).$$ Now multiply out $$f(x) = x^2 - (a+b)x +ab \\ g(x) = x^2 - (c +d)x + cd$$ and the result is trivial.

The question is: Factor $x^4 - 11x^2y^2 + y^4$ The answer is: $(x^2 - 3xy -y^2)(x^2 + 3xy - y^2)$ My question is: How did the textbook get this? I tried the following methods (examples of my working below): U-Substitution. Guess and Check. Reversing the question (multiplying the answer out). Here is my working for each case so far. (1) U-Substitution. I tried a simpler case via u-substitution. Let $u = x^2$ and $v = y^2$. Then $x^4 - 11x^2y^2 + y^4 = u^2 -11uv + v^2$. Given the middle term is not even, then it doesn't factor into something resembling $(u + v)^2$ or $(u - v)^2$. Also, there doesn't appear to be any factors such that $ab = 1$ (the coefficient of the third term) and $a + b = -11$ (the coefficient of the second term) where $u^2 -11uv + v^2$ resembles $(u \pm a)(v \pm b)$ and the final answer. (2) Guess and Check. To obtain the first term in $x^4 - 11x^2y^2 + y^4$ it must be $x^2x^2 = x^4$. To obtain the third term would be $y^2y^2 = y^4$. So I'm left with something resembling: $(x^2 \pm y^2)(x^2 \pm y^2)$. But I'm at a loss as to how to get the final solution's middle term from guessing and checking. (3) Reversing the question Here I took the answer, multiplied it out, to see if the reverse of the factoring process would illuminate how the answer was generated. The original answer: $(x^2 - 3xy -y^2)(x^2 + 3xy - y^2) = [(x^2 - 3xy) - y^2][(x^2 + 3xy) - y^2]$ $= (x^2 - 3xy)(x^2 + 3xy) + (x^2 - 3xy)(-y^2) + (x^2 + 3xy)(-y^2) + (-y^2)(-y^2)$ $= [(x^2)^2 - (3xy)^2] + [(-y^2)x^2 + 3y^3x] + [(-y^2)x^2 - 3y^3x] + [y^4]$ $= x^4 - 9x^2y^2 - y^2x^2 + 3y^3x - y^2x^2 - 3y^3x + y^4$ The $3y^3x$ terms cancel out, and we are left with: $x^4 - 9x^2y^2 - 2x^2y^2 + y^4 = x^4 - 11x^2y^2 + y^4$, which is the original question. The thing I don't understand about this reverse process is where the $3y^3x$ terms came from. Obviously $3y^3x - 3y^3x = 0$ by additive inverse, and $a + 0 = a$, but I'm wondering how you would know to add $3y^3x - 3y^3x$ to the original expression, and then make the further leap to factoring out like terms (by splitting the $11x^2y^2$ to $-9x^2y^2$, $-y^2x^2$, and $-y^2x^2$).","This is an exercise from Schaum's Outline of Precalculus . It doesn't give a worked solution, just the answer. The question is: Factor $x^4 - 11x^2y^2 + y^4$ The answer is: $(x^2 - 3xy -y^2)(x^2 + 3xy - y^2)$ My question is: How did the textbook get this? I tried the following methods (examples of my working below): U-Substitution. Guess and Check. Reversing the question (multiplying the answer out). Here is my working for each case so far. (1) U-Substitution. I tried a simpler case via u-substitution. Let $u = x^2$ and $v = y^2$. Then $x^4 - 11x^2y^2 + y^4 = u^2 -11uv + v^2$. Given the middle term is not even, then it doesn't factor into something resembling $(u + v)^2$ or $(u - v)^2$. Also, there doesn't appear to be any factors such that $ab = 1$ (the coefficient of the third term) and $a + b = -11$ (the coefficient of the second term) where $u^2 -11uv + v^2$ resembles $(u \pm a)(v \pm b)$ and the final answer. (2) Guess and Check. To obtain the first term in $x^4 - 11x^2y^2 + y^4$ it must be $x^2x^2 = x^4$. To obtain the third term would be $y^2y^2 = y^4$. So I'm left with something resembling: $(x^2 \pm y^2)(x^2 \pm y^2)$. But I'm at a loss as to how to get the final solution's middle term from guessing and checking. (3) Reversing the question Here I took the answer, multiplied it out, to see if the reverse of the factoring process would illuminate how the answer was generated. The original answer: $(x^2 - 3xy -y^2)(x^2 + 3xy - y^2) = [(x^2 - 3xy) - y^2][(x^2 + 3xy) - y^2]$ $= (x^2 - 3xy)(x^2 + 3xy) + (x^2 - 3xy)(-y^2) + (x^2 + 3xy)(-y^2) + (-y^2)(-y^2)$ $= [(x^2)^2 - (3xy)^2] + [(-y^2)x^2 + 3y^3x] + [(-y^2)x^2 - 3y^3x] + [y^4]$ $= x^4 - 9x^2y^2 - y^2x^2 + 3y^3x - y^2x^2 - 3y^3x + y^4$ The $3y^3x$ terms cancel out, and we are left with: $x^4 - 9x^2y^2 - 2x^2y^2 + y^4 = x^4 - 11x^2y^2 + y^4$, which is the original question. The thing I don't understand about this reverse process is where the $3y^3x$ terms came from. Obviously $3y^3x - 3y^3x = 0$ by additive inverse, and $a + 0 = a$, but I'm wondering how you would know to add $3y^3x - 3y^3x$ to the original expression, and then make the further leap to factoring out like terms (by splitting the $11x^2y^2$ to $-9x^2y^2$, $-y^2x^2$, and $-y^2x^2$).",,"['algebra-precalculus', 'factoring']"

But what if we differentiate twice? We'll get $$(ab)''=a''b+2a'b'+ab''.$$ Now this does resemble something: $$(a+b)^2=a^2b^0+2a^1b^1+a^0b^2.$$ Of course, going to the next level now gives us the expected result: $$(ab)'''=a'''b+3a''b'+3a'b''+ab''',$$ in full accordance to known binomial expansion: $$(a+b)^3=a^3b^0+3a^2b^1+3a^1b^2+a^0b^3.$$ I know that binomial expansion stems from distributive law of multiplication over addition. It's easy because integer powers can be interpreted as iterated multiplication. But I can't seem to see any simiar distributive law of differentiation over product. Observing this, I wonder: how to explain this striking similarity between seemingly unrelated things? Can this be explained by some generalized form of distributive law?","A formula for differentiating a product is well known: $$(ab)'=a'b+ab'.$$ At first sight it doesn't resemble anything interesting.
