On the Wiki page about groupoids, it is written (I write here my own more concise version): Algebraic Definition: A partial function $f:X\to Y$ is a function $f:A\to Y$ for some $\emptyset\neq A\subseteq X$. A groupoid is a set $G$ with a unary operation $^{-1}:G\to G$ and a partial function  $\ast:G\times G \to G$ that satisfy the following axiomatic properties for arbitrary  $a,b,c\in G$: (associativity) If $a\ast b$ and $b\ast c$ are defined, then $(a\ast b)\ast c$ and $a\ast(b\ast c)$ are defined and equal. Conversely, if either of these last two expressions is defined, then so is the other, and again they are equal. (inverses) $a^{-1}\!\ast a$ and $a\ast     a^{-1}$ are always defined. (identity) If $a\ast b$ is defined, then $a\ast b\ast b^{-1} \!= a$ and $a^{-1}\!\ast a\ast b = b$.   (1. and 2. already show that these expressions are defined.)

Category-Theoretic Definition: A groupoid $\underline{G}$ is a small category (i.e. its class of objects $\underline{G}$ and its class of morphisms $\mathrm{Hom}_{\underline{G}}$ are sets) in which every morphism is an isomorphism (i.e. is invertible). Thus a groupoid is equipped with the composition $\circ$ and invertion $^-$ of morphisms. Comparing the Definitions: Both definitions are equivalent, as follows. Given a category-theoretic groupoid $\underline{G}$, let $G$ be the set of all morphisms of $\underline{G}$. Then $\circ$ becomes a partially defined operation on $G$, and $^-$ is in fact defined everywhere. Therefore we take $\ast:=\circ$ and $^{-1}:=^-$ and obtain an algebraic groupoid. Conversely, given an algebraic groupoid $G$, define the objects of a category $\underline{G}$ as $\{x\ast x^{-1};\:x\!\in\!G\}$ and define $\underline{G}(x,y)$ as  $\{f\!\in\!G;\:y\ast f\ast x\text{ is defined}\}$. Then $^{-1}$ and $\ast$ break up into several functions on the various $\underline{G}(x,y)$, which may be called $^-$ and $\circ$, respectively.

The most obvious thing to do to try and compute successive differences at $\{0\},\{0,1\},\{0,1,2\},\dots$ and wait for a pattern to occur, but my preliminary intuition tells me that this does not necessarily work.

I also knew Abstract Algebra is a very broad subject, and many modern subjects are rooted in its matter, including Algebraic Geometry, Algebraic Topology, Algebraic Number Theory, and many more subjects. I would be disappointed, however. The course was hard. I didn't mind that (I suspected it would). I didn't mind others being naturally better at it than me (as I'm not a particularly talented mathematician). I do think that I could have learned the material better if it would be presented in a different matter, though. Every student received a little booklet, containing course notes. All material was in there. I felt that the material was presented in quite a dense manner. I like to see a lot of worked examples of new material I'm learning, but there weren't many in there. I guess the booklet covered in 135 pages about the same material the abstract algebra book by Dummit and Foote covers in about 223 pages. I guess a somewhat bigger ""reference book"", like Dummit and Foote's or Fraleigh's book, would serve me better. Furthermore, we had to do a lot of exercises from the booklet. Each week, we had to hand in assignments, consisting of exercises in the booklet. Everything went pretty fast. Your work would be checked and graded, but the ""ideal"" solutions would not be shown on, for example, a webpage.

Multiplication is defined as follows: the product of two basis elements (monomials) is their concatenation, i.e.     $$(X_{i_1}\!\ldots X_{i_m}) \cdot (X_{j_1}\!\ldots X_{j_n}) := X_{i_1}\!\ldots X_{i_m}X_{j_1}\!\ldots X_{j_n};$$     the product of any two elements (polynomials) just takes into account that $\cdot$ must be $R$-bilinear.

When $|X|\!=\!n\!<\!\infty$, this algebra is denoted $R\langle X_1,\ldots,X_n\rangle$. In short, for any set $X$, the free unital $R$-algebra on $X$ is $$R\langle X\rangle:=\bigoplus_{w\in X^\ast}Rw$$ with the $R$-bilinear multiplication that is concatenation on monomials/words, where $X^\ast$ is the free monoid on $X$ and $Rw\!=\!\{rw;\:r\!\in\!R\}$ is the formal free module on $w$, i.e. $rw\!=\!r'w\Leftrightarrow r\!=\!r'$. The empty word/monomial of $X^\ast$ is the identity $1$ of $R\langle X\rangle$. The map $i\!:X\!\rightarrow\!R\langle X\rangle$, $X_i\!\mapsto\!X_i$ is called the canonical injection . If we replace $X^\ast$ with $X^+$ (the free semigroup on $X$, i.e. $X^\ast$ without the empty word) in the above construction, we create the free nonunital $R$-algebra on $X$ : $R\langle X\rangle^+\!=\!R\langle X\,|\,\emptyset\rangle^+$.

Elements of $S$ are relations or relators . These notions are analogously defined for the free nonunital $R$-algebra on $X$; the presentation is then denoted $R\langle X|S\rangle^+$. COMMENT: Rings are $\mathbb{Z}$-algebras, so the above construction gives us the free ring on $X$ , namely $\mathbb{Z}\langle X\rangle^+$, and free unital ring on $X$ , namely $\mathbb{Z}\langle X\rangle$. PROPOSITION (universal property): Let $i\!:X\!\rightarrow\!R\langle X\rangle$ be the canonical injection. For any unital $R$-algebra $A$ and any map $f\!:X\!\rightarrow\!A$, there exists a unique unital algebra homomorphism $\overline{f}\!:R\langle X\rangle\!\rightarrow\!A$ such that $f\!=\!\overline{f}\!\circ\!i$, namely $\overline{f}(\sum r_iX_{j_1}\ldots X_{j_i})=\sum r_if(X_{j_1})\cdot\ldots\cdot f(X_{j_i})$. Proof: $\overline{f}$ must be a homomorphism and $f\!=\!\overline{f}\!\circ\!i$, so $\overline{f}(\sum r_iX_{j_1}\!\ldots\!X_{j_i}\!)\!=\!\sum r_if(X_{j_1}\!)\!\cdot\ldots\!\cdot\!f(X_{j_i}\!)$  must be satisfied, hence uniqueness of $\overline{f}$. It is also evident that such $\overline{f}$ is a unital algebra homomorphism. To prove it is well defined, assume $\sum r_iX_{j_1}\ldots X_{j_i}\!=\!0$. By definition, $R\langle X\rangle$ is a free module on $X^\ast$, thus $r_i\!=\!0$. Therefore $\overline{f}(0)\!=\!0$, and $\overline{f}$ is well defined. $\blacksquare$ COMMENT: by the universal property, $R\langle X\rangle$ is the free object on $X$ in the category of unital $R$-algebras. PROPOSITION: Every unital $R$-algebra $A$ has a presentation, i.e. $\forall A\:\exists X,S\!:\: A\!\cong\!R\langle X|S\rangle$. Proof: Let $A$ be generated by $X\!\subseteq\!A$ ($X:=A$ suffices) and let $f\!:X\!\hookrightarrow\!A$ be the inclusion. By the universal property, $\exists!$ algebra homomorphism $\overline{f}\!:R\langle X\rangle\!\rightarrow\!A$ that extends $f$. We have $X\!\subseteq\!\mathrm{Im}\,\overline{f}$, so $\overline{f}$ is surjective. Therefore $A\!\cong\!R\langle X\rangle/\mathrm{Ker}\,\overline{f}\!=\!R\langle X| \mathrm{Ker}\,\overline{f}\rangle$. $\blacksquare$ QUESTION: how can I prove the statement $R\langle X\rangle\!\cong\!R\langle Y\rangle\:\Rightarrow\:|X|\!=\!|Y|$ ? I've thought of using the following theorem from Grillet's Abstract algebra (page 333): However, this just gives us $|X^\ast|\!=\!|Y^\ast|$. I've also thought of abelianising both algebras, so we get $R[X]\!\cong\!R[Y]$. But I'm not sure how to continue from here.","An analogous question regarding free groups can be found here .

Elements of $S$ are relations or relators . These notions are analogously defined for the free nonunital $R$-algebra on $X$; the presentation is then denoted $R\langle X|S\rangle^+$. COMMENT: Rings are $\mathbb{Z}$-algebras, so the above construction gives us the free ring on $X$ , namely $\mathbb{Z}\langle X\rangle^+$, and free unital ring on $X$ , namely $\mathbb{Z}\langle X\rangle$. PROPOSITION (universal property): Let $i\!:X\!\rightarrow\!R\langle X\rangle$ be the canonical injection. For any unital $R$-algebra $A$ and any map $f\!:X\!\rightarrow\!A$, there exists a unique unital algebra homomorphism $\overline{f}\!:R\langle X\rangle\!\rightarrow\!A$ such that $f\!=\!\overline{f}\!\circ\!i$, namely $\overline{f}(\sum r_iX_{j_1}\ldots X_{j_i})=\sum r_if(X_{j_1})\cdot\ldots\cdot f(X_{j_i})$. Proof: $\overline{f}$ must be a homomorphism and $f\!=\!\overline{f}\!\circ\!i$, so $\overline{f}(\sum r_iX_{j_1}\!\ldots\!X_{j_i}\!)\!=\!\sum r_if(X_{j_1}\!)\!\cdot\ldots\!\cdot\!f(X_{j_i}\!)$  must be satisfied, hence uniqueness of $\overline{f}$. It is also evident that such $\overline{f}$ is a unital algebra homomorphism. To prove it is well defined, assume $\sum r_iX_{j_1}\ldots X_{j_i}\!=\!0$. By definition, $R\langle X\rangle$ is a free module on $X^\ast$, thus $r_i\!=\!0$. Therefore $\overline{f}(0)\!=\!0$, and $\overline{f}$ is well defined. $\blacksquare$ COMMENT: by the universal property, $R\langle X\rangle$ is the free object on $X$ in the category of unital $R$-algebras. PROPOSITION: Every unital $R$-algebra $A$ has a presentation, i.e. $\forall A\:\exists X,S\!:\: A\!\cong\!R\langle X|S\rangle$. Proof: Let $A$ be generated by $X\!\subseteq\!A$ ($X:=A$ suffices) and let $f\!:X\!\hookrightarrow\!A$ be the inclusion. By the universal property, $\exists!$ algebra homomorphism $\overline{f}\!:R\langle X\rangle\!\rightarrow\!A$ that extends $f$. We have $X\!\subseteq\!\mathrm{Im}\,\overline{f}$, so $\overline{f}$ is surjective. Therefore $A\!\cong\!R\langle X\rangle/\mathrm{Ker}\,\overline{f}\!=\!R\langle X| \mathrm{Ker}\,\overline{f}\rangle$. $\blacksquare$ QUESTION: how can I prove the statement $R\langle X\rangle\!\cong\!R\langle Y\rangle\:\Rightarrow\:|X|\!=\!|Y|$ ? I've thought of using the following theorem from Grillet's Abstract algebra (page 333): However, this just gives us $|X^\ast|\!=\!|Y^\ast|$. I've also thought of abelianising both algebras, so we get $R[X]\!\cong\!R[Y]$. But I'm not sure how to continue from here.",,['abstract-algebra']

Now, since I don't have any references for this result I was trying to prove it myself, and my supposed proof is the following. What I think is that I basically only need the fact that $K/\mathbb{Q}$ is a normal extension, and then I use the following condition, that is equivalent to normality. Since $K/\mathbb{Q}$ is normal then every embedding $\sigma: K \hookrightarrow \overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ is an automorphism of $K$, which means in particular that $\sigma(K) = K$. Then since we either have $K \subset \mathbb{R}$ or else $K \cap (\mathbb{C} \setminus \mathbb{R} ) \neq \emptyset$ then this shows that $K$ is either totally real or totally imaginary.
