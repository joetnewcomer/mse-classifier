It's not that there's no answer. The mathematical answer is a single phrase, ""The rank of a quadratic form."" And near the end: Okay, so where's the quadratic form? Let's look at the variance of a single sample. If $y$ is an $n$ by $1$ vector of observations, then   $$\sum(y_i - \bar{y})^2 = y^{\prime}My\text{, where }M = \begin{pmatrix} 1-\frac{1}{n} & -1/n & \cdot & -1/n \\ -1/n          & 1-\frac{1}{n} & \cdot & -1/n \\ \cdot         & \cdot         & \cdot & \cdot \\ -1/n          & -1/n          & -1/n & 1-\frac{1}{n} \end{pmatrix}\text{.}$$   The number of degrees of freedom is equal to the rank of the $n$ by $n$ matrix $M$, which is $n-1$. I will use $r$ to denote the rank and $C(A)$ to denote the column space of a matrix $A$. From my notes, I have the definition $r(A) = r\left(C(A)\right)$, which is the number of vectors that create a basis for $C(A)$. Sure. Let's consider column one: $$\begin{pmatrix} 1-\frac{1}{n}\\ -1/n \\ \cdot \\ -1/n \end{pmatrix} = \dfrac{-1}{n} \begin{pmatrix} 1-n \\ 1 \\ \cdot \\ 1  \end{pmatrix} = \dfrac{-1}{n}\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ \cdot \\ 1  \end{pmatrix} + \dfrac{-1}{n}\begin{pmatrix} -n \\ 0 \\ \cdot \\ 0  \end{pmatrix} = \dfrac{-1}{n}\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ \cdot \\ 1  \end{pmatrix}+\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ \cdot \\ 0  \end{pmatrix}\text{.} $$ So based on what I'm seeing here, I'm guessing that a basis for $C(A)$ would be something like  $$\mathscr{V} = \left\{\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ \cdot \\ 1  \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ \cdot \\ 0  \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ \cdot \\ 0  \end{pmatrix}, \cdots, \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ \cdot \\ 1  \end{pmatrix}\right\}$$ which consists of $n+1$ vectors. However, clearly $$\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ \cdot \\ 1  \end{pmatrix}$$ needs to be removed, since it is the sum of the other $n$ vectors, so I get that there are $n$ vectors in $\mathscr{V}$, and therefore $r(\mathscr{V}) = r(C(M)) = n$. Where is the $n-1$ coming from?","So I'm looking at this website which states: One of the questions an instrutor [sic] dreads most from a mathematically unsophisticated audience is, ""What exactly is degrees of freedom?""

Let's look at the variance of a single sample. If $y$ is an $n$ by $1$ vector of observations, then   $$\sum(y_i - \bar{y})^2 = y^{\prime}My\text{, where }M = \begin{pmatrix} 1-\frac{1}{n} & -1/n & \cdot & -1/n \\ -1/n          & 1-\frac{1}{n} & \cdot & -1/n \\ \cdot         & \cdot         & \cdot & \cdot \\ -1/n          & -1/n          & -1/n & 1-\frac{1}{n} \end{pmatrix}\text{.}$$   The number of degrees of freedom is equal to the rank of the $n$ by $n$ matrix $M$, which is $n-1$. I will use $r$ to denote the rank and $C(A)$ to denote the column space of a matrix $A$. From my notes, I have the definition $r(A) = r\left(C(A)\right)$, which is the number of vectors that create a basis for $C(A)$. Sure. Let's consider column one: $$\begin{pmatrix} 1-\frac{1}{n}\\ -1/n \\ \cdot \\ -1/n \end{pmatrix} = \dfrac{-1}{n} \begin{pmatrix} 1-n \\ 1 \\ \cdot \\ 1  \end{pmatrix} = \dfrac{-1}{n}\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ \cdot \\ 1  \end{pmatrix} + \dfrac{-1}{n}\begin{pmatrix} -n \\ 0 \\ \cdot \\ 0  \end{pmatrix} = \dfrac{-1}{n}\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ \cdot \\ 1  \end{pmatrix}+\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ \cdot \\ 0  \end{pmatrix}\text{.} $$ So based on what I'm seeing here, I'm guessing that a basis for $C(A)$ would be something like  $$\mathscr{V} = \left\{\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ \cdot \\ 1  \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ \cdot \\ 0  \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ \cdot \\ 0  \end{pmatrix}, \cdots, \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ \cdot \\ 1  \end{pmatrix}\right\}$$ which consists of $n+1$ vectors. However, clearly $$\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ \cdot \\ 1  \end{pmatrix}$$ needs to be removed, since it is the sum of the other $n$ vectors, so I get that there are $n$ vectors in $\mathscr{V}$, and therefore $r(\mathscr{V}) = r(C(M)) = n$.

26,Surface normal to point on displaced sphere,Surface normal to point on displaced sphere,,"I want to calculate the surface normal to a point on a deformed sphere. The surface of the sphere is displaced along its (original) normals by a function $f(\vec x)$. In mathematical terms: Let $\vec x$ be a unit length vector in 3D, i.e. any point on the unit sphere centered on the origin. And let $f:\vec x \to \mathbb{R}$ be a function with a well-defined and continuous gradient $\nabla f(\vec x)$ for every $\vec x$. Now a point on the surface of the resulting sphere is defined as: $\vec P(\vec x) = (R + s \cdot f(\vec x)) \cdot \vec x$ where $R$ and $s$ are constants for the radius and the modulation depth, respectively. The question now: Is this information sufficient to calculate the surface normal to the point $\vec P$? I feel like this should be possible, but it is entirely possible that it is not. More information: The function in my case is 3D Simplex Noise which gives values on the range $(-1,1)$ for any $\vec x$. The values for $R$ are about 10 times larger than those of $s$, probably more. Maybe this helps if only an approximation is possible. UPDATE: Yes, it is possible, though there is still some error in here: Calculate the gradient: $\vec g = \nabla f(\vec x)$ Then project it into the tangent plane to the sphere passing through the point: $\vec h = \vec g - (\vec g \cdot \vec x)\vec x$ The normal can then be calculated as $\vec n = \vec x - s \cdot \vec h$ This works as long as the radius is $R=1$ and something like $s \ll R$. I think for $R \ne 1$ the gradient has to be rescaled: $\vec g = \dfrac{1}{R} \nabla f(\vec x)$ But I have no idea why the error gets larger with increasing $s$. UPDATE 2: Alright, the rescaling factor was only half complete $\vec g = \dfrac{\nabla f(\vec x)}{R + s \cdot f(\vec x)}$ Now it works for all $R$ and $s$.

This is promising, and means that we have to prove that we can choose $c$ and $d$ so that these two statements hold: $$a=Lc$$ $$1=c^tc+d^2$$ The first is easy because $L$ is invertible: $$c=L^{-1}a$$ Then second equation becomes $$1=a^t(L^{-1})^tL^{-1}a+d^2$$ or $$1=a^tA^{-1}a+d^2$$ or $$d=\sqrt{1 - a^tA^{-1}a }$$ which gives a real $d$ so long as $a^t A^{-1} a<1$, but I am not sure one can prove this. If that helps, the entries of $A$ and inner products of unit vectors. I have not been able to find numerical counterexamples, but the elements of $a$ are not necessarily small and in the worst case its norm is close to $N$. Is there something about the norm of $A^{-1}$ or of $L^-1$ that can help me out here? Thanks, Stefano",,"['linear-algebra', 'matrices', 'matrix-calculus', 'matrix-decomposition']"

Suppose $\mathbf A$ is a positive semi-definite matrix with rank $k$; that is, some of its eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ may be zero, but all the positive eigenvalues are larger than $b$ and $b'$. This is what we want to prove: $$(\mathbf A - b\mathbf I)^{-1} - (\mathbf A - b'\mathbf I)^{-1} \succeq \frac{\delta}{2}(\mathbf A - b'\mathbf I)^{-2}$$ where $b' = b-\delta > \delta > 0$ and $\mathbf X \succeq \mathbf Y$ means $\mathbf X - \mathbf Y$ is positive semi-definite. He finished his proof by showing the following two things: $$\frac{-1}{b} - \frac{-1}{b'} = \frac{b-b'}{bb'} =  \frac{\delta}{b'(b'+\delta)} \geq \frac{\delta}{2(b')^2}$$ and $$\frac{1}{\lambda_i - b} - \frac{1}{\lambda_i-b'} = \frac{b-b'}{(\lambda_i - b)(\lambda_i - b')} \geq \frac{\delta}{(\lambda_i - b')^2}.$$ My question is: To prove $\mathbf X - \mathbf Y \succeq \mathbf Z$, is it enough to check their eigenvalues and find some relation between them?

This should, in turn, imply that there must exist an $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{Z}^m,\ \mathbf{x}\geq\mathbf{0}$ so that $A\mathbf{x} \geq \mathbf{b}$. Obviously that is not a proof, and anything but formal. But maybe someone could enlighten me on how such a formal proof could be constructed – or maybe, in case I'm altogether wrong, provide a counterexample?

This fact is obviously easy to prove using the definition of the determinant, but the question stipulates that the proof must be by row reduction. It would never occur to me to do it this way. How do you even get to the transpose using row reduction? I've always just swapped the rows and columns. Any advice would be appreciated.","I need to prove that the determinant of a matrix is equal to the determinant of its transpose.
